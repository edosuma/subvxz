THE NINTH CONFIGURATION

03:52.150 --> 03:55.320
Aborting the launch.

03:58.698 --> 04:01.868
Aborting the launch.

04:01.951 --> 04:05.580
There is nothing up there!
Nothing, nothing!

04:57.090 --> 04:59.551
Somebody's coming.

05:00.510 --> 05:07.058
Good morning, you fucking Venusians!
You wanna fight me? I'll fight you!

05:07.433 --> 05:09.686
May Day, May day,
Sink the Bismarck!

05:09.686 --> 05:11.729
I'm coming down.

05:13.606 --> 05:16.234
Look out..this looks like a job for superman...

05:16.234 --> 05:22.824
Damn you Mayor Nammack,
get a move on! Move on! Move on you weirdos!

05:22.824 --> 05:25.368
You know I wish you'd douche; sincerely.

05:26.411 --> 05:27.662
Watch your elbow.

05:27.829 --> 05:30.039
Hey mom, could I have a quarter for the movies please?

05:30.665 --> 05:33.877
Damned sun, there is no color in the air.

05:34.544 --> 05:37.380
- What country is this?
- The Bronx.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.843
Attention!

05:52.145 --> 05:54.314
Hail Caesar!

06:01.362 --> 06:04.866
Towards the end of the war in Vietnam
an unusually high percentage...

06:04.908 --> 06:09.245
... of american servicemen suddenly manifested symptoms of psychosis.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.873
Most of them were in combat...

06:11.915 --> 06:15.001
... and had no prior history of mental disturbance.

06:15.835 --> 06:17.587
These facts,

06:17.587 --> 06:20.715
plus the epidemic scope of the problem
and the controversial nature of the vietnam war...

06:20.757 --> 06:22.967
...led american authorities to wonder whether many...

06:22.967 --> 06:25.136
... if not most of the men, were faking.

06:25.929 --> 06:28.181
To probe the mystery,

06:28.223 --> 06:30.808
the government established a network of
secret study centres and clinics.

06:30.934 --> 06:35.104
The last of these
No. 18 was highly experimental in nature...

06:35.146 --> 06:39.108
... set up in an old abandoned castle in Pacific NorthWest in United States.

06:40.318 --> 06:42.779
Among these inmates was an astronaut,

06:42.779 --> 06:46.324
who during final countdown
had aborted the mission into outer space.

06:47.158 --> 06:50.161
Robert Browning had the clap,

06:50.870 --> 06:54.374
and he caught it from Charlotte
and Emily Bronte.

06:54.499 --> 06:59.212
- Shut your mouth, you crazy bastard!
- You don't want to hear the truth.

06:59.754 --> 07:02.799
- He caught it from both of them...
- Shut up!

07:04.509 --> 07:06.678
Fucking weirdos.

07:06.970 --> 07:10.473
Yellow smartass college pricks...
- that says it.

07:15.687 --> 07:17.480
Who do you think you're kidding, huh?

07:20.608 --> 07:24.237
Well bad news boys.
Tough shit.

07:27.198 --> 07:30.326
Well, guess who's coming to take command next week?

07:30.577 --> 07:32.537
Can you guess boys, huh?

07:35.790 --> 07:37.458
A psychiatrist!

07:38.293 --> 07:40.879
The best. The best in uniform!

07:41.212 --> 07:44.757
The greatest fucking psychiatrist since Jung!

07:46.551 --> 07:49.721
Guessing you're good at,
you slimy snakes...

07:49.971 --> 07:51.556
- Bravo.
- Good image.

07:52.098 --> 07:54.642
- Splendid, Groper.
- Just one more thing sir.

07:54.684 --> 07:55.852
What?

07:55.852 --> 07:58.980
Stick a pineapple up your ass
and pretend you're Hawaiian.
-Jesus..

08:00.857 --> 08:02.942
Dammit! Who the hell is coming?

08:03.193 --> 08:07.739
Vincent, vincent...

08:08.531 --> 08:09.699
Vincent!

08:24.756 --> 08:28.551
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes, its alright.

08:36.226 --> 08:41.105
I confess that I love you...

08:42.565 --> 08:46.903
... tell me will you love me too.

08:48.196 --> 08:52.700
I confess that I need you...
Oh yes, I do.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.581
- ... need you every morning.
- Shut up!

09:00.583 --> 09:02.001
What's that in your hand?

09:02.126 --> 09:05.922
A fog horn...chinese junks have
been reported in the area.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.132
Cutshaw, get back in the line.

09:12.554 --> 09:15.098
- Fall in!
- You're supposed to be nice to us, Groper.

09:15.807 --> 09:19.060
Here comes the psychiatrist, Groper..
time to clean up your act!

09:19.227 --> 09:21.521
Yeah, call us pricks now, Groper.
Go ahead.

09:21.563 --> 09:26.109
Hey, lets hear it for the shrink!
Let's have a song "You are my sunshine."

09:28.987 --> 09:34.200
"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine...

09:34.742 --> 09:39.622
... you make me happy,
When skies are grey.

09:40.123 --> 09:45.211
You'll never know, dear,
How much I love you....

09:46.129 --> 09:50.842
Please don't take my sunshine away".

09:51.259 --> 09:55.805
- Boys, would you knock this off.
- Fuck you.

09:58.266 --> 09:59.434
Its very pretty.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.979
Famous lines from famous movies!

10:03.396 --> 10:07.275
"Oh Frankie, your mother forgives me!"

10:08.568 --> 10:10.570
Victor McLaglen in "The Informer"

10:12.780 --> 10:15.200
"We don't need no stinking badges"

10:15.491 --> 10:19.037
"The Treasure of Sierra Madre"

10:21.789 --> 10:23.041
Thank you, sargeant.

10:23.875 --> 10:26.544
- Take care.
- Goodbye, sir.

10:27.003 --> 10:27.795
Goodbye.

10:37.013 --> 10:39.682
He's done it again...
My jacket, my shirt and my pants...

10:41.643 --> 10:42.685
Sir.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.910
Boys, come to attention.

10:59.285 --> 11:02.163
You've go to say "Simon says"
then we'll do it...

11:02.664 --> 11:03.831
Play therapy. What a fine thought!

11:05.458 --> 11:06.501
- Poor bastards.
- Simon says fall in!

11:10.630 --> 11:13.216
You're a psychiatrist, aren't you?
Kane...

11:14.259 --> 11:16.344
Yeah, I thought so. I'm Fromme,
I'm a medical officer.

11:17.220 --> 11:20.682
Sure as glad you're best.
I can use all the help I can possibly get.

11:20.974 --> 11:22.600
- Cutshaw!
- Fuck you.

11:23.059 --> 11:24.853
Just answer: "Present".

11:25.061 --> 11:27.313
They're really far gone.

11:28.439 --> 11:29.274
Perhaps...

11:31.359 --> 11:32.527
Perhaps?

11:32.986 --> 11:36.406
What do you mean? You're following
some crazy new school of psychiatry?

11:36.573 --> 11:39.117
These guys are nuttier than a wagon-load of pralines.

11:40.410 --> 11:42.287
Fromme, where is Fromme?

11:44.581 --> 11:47.166
- Would you please direct me to my quarters?
- What?

11:49.085 --> 11:52.463
- My quarters, would you please direct me to my quarters?
- Sure; just follow the yellow brick road.

11:53.339 --> 11:56.176
- I beg your pardon?
- I said follow... here they are.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.094
Sargeant Krebs and Christian, Sir.

11:58.469 --> 12:02.098
And bloody damn well about time...
Will you get this man into surgery?

12:02.140 --> 12:06.644
Or you are planning to just let him
stand here while you and your buddies play soldier?!

12:06.728 --> 12:09.063
For chrissake, what is this?
A hospital or a nuthouse?

12:09.564 --> 12:12.442
No, no!
Not the stethoscope!

12:13.818 --> 12:15.778
Don't let him wrinkle the pants.

12:17.739 --> 12:19.490
I'm colonel Richard Fell,
I'm the medic.

12:24.287 --> 12:25.038
Really...

12:25.580 --> 12:27.665
Boys, aren't you being a little dick silly?

12:27.957 --> 12:29.667
Vincent?

12:32.045 --> 12:33.296
Could I have it again please?

12:34.422 --> 12:36.049
You remind me of Vincent Van Gogh...

12:36.549 --> 12:39.344
Either that.... or a lark in a wheat field.
I'm not sure which.

12:39.427 --> 12:41.971
- Have you been drinking?
- Never in uniform, no.

12:42.013 --> 12:42.597
I see.

12:42.639 --> 12:44.933
That's my last pair of pants he's got there, you see.

12:44.974 --> 12:46.809
All the rest of them are at the cleaners.

12:46.893 --> 12:49.062
and Colonel, if you're planning on
my holding this salute much longer,

12:49.062 --> 12:52.815
would you mind calling the Memorial hospital and telling
the donor arm is ready for the transplant?

12:52.815 --> 12:55.652
I expect it to be falling off almost any second now.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.696
Thank you, sir.
You're a prince of the realm, I swear it.

12:59.405 --> 13:00.782
Attention!

13:01.199 --> 13:02.909
Shut your fucking mouths.

13:05.161 --> 13:06.204
Firmes!

13:06.788 --> 13:09.916
Listen, I know my rights.
I want to see my urologist.

13:18.007 --> 13:19.592
Hail Caesar!

13:22.804 --> 13:25.139
Sir, I present the group.

13:29.811 --> 13:31.938
Jesus Christ...

13:51.165 --> 13:52.292
Dismissed.

15:28.596 --> 15:29.764
Ok, set the cards.

15:30.139 --> 15:31.349
Anything wild?

15:31.891 --> 15:34.644
Douches, 3s, 5s, 7s, 9s and Jack.

15:35.186 --> 15:37.522
You are a very sick man.

15:42.151 --> 15:43.278
Are you finished?

15:45.697 --> 15:50.034
- Most people cut them only once.
- 13 is my lucky number.

16:13.683 --> 16:15.143
Yup, I know what you mean.

16:15.643 --> 16:17.520
It was Amy Biltmore's place.

16:17.770 --> 16:21.858
She had it brought over here from Germany
in 1900, stone by stone...

16:22.442 --> 16:25.403
It belonged to her husband, Count of Eltz.
What's the matter? You don't like it?

16:26.487 --> 16:27.864
Its hardly therapuetic.

16:28.865 --> 16:30.450
Yeah, Exactly what Dracula said about it.

16:31.034 --> 16:34.537
But its hidden away in the spring, the Biltmores not brought him for nothing.

16:36.998 --> 16:38.082
Wish I hadn't said that...

16:42.962 --> 16:45.048
- You remind me of someone.
- Who?

16:46.257 --> 16:47.717
I don't know.

16:49.010 --> 16:50.803
But you seem so familiar to me.

16:50.845 --> 16:54.307
Dracula said that too. You see,
when he sees a neck, he'll say anything.

16:54.516 --> 16:56.518
- I guess it will come to me.
- What?

16:56.768 --> 16:58.728
Who you remind me of...

16:59.020 --> 17:00.772
Oh, didn't you say -

17:10.323 --> 17:12.909
- I hid it goddammit, I hid it.
  Where did you find -
- Groper.

17:13.785 --> 17:15.203
But sir, he's been pounding that...

17:15.244 --> 17:17.329
I don't care what he's being doing,

17:17.329 --> 17:19.499
You're not to put your hands on him.

17:19.499 --> 17:21.709
But colonel, he can't...!

17:25.588 --> 17:26.506
Yes sir.

17:27.882 --> 17:29.133
Right, sir.

17:32.178 --> 17:34.180
Whatever you say, sir.

17:34.514 --> 17:37.308
- You're Capitán Fairbanks?
- Not today.

17:37.350 --> 17:39.310
I'm sorry?
I'm sure you were...

17:39.519 --> 17:42.605
Not today, do you understand me?

17:44.524 --> 17:46.609
Multiple personality.

17:46.985 --> 17:49.779
- My house has many mansions.
- Yes.

17:50.446 --> 17:53.783
I am Dr. Franz VonPaulie.

17:54.492 --> 17:55.910
Why did you do that to the wall?

17:56.703 --> 18:00.248
Because I am convinced that
we can walk through walls.

18:00.790 --> 18:03.042
Not only me...

18:04.002 --> 18:04.961
Anyone.

18:05.837 --> 18:08.506
Cops, people.

18:09.465 --> 18:11.217
People in Nashville.

18:12.594 --> 18:17.724
I tried to exert the full force of my mind
on all the atoms of my body,

18:18.057 --> 18:25.815
So that they will mix, rearrange and
fit exactly all the holes in that wall.

18:27.650 --> 18:30.278
Then I tried the laboratory method...

18:30.945 --> 18:33.448
I tried to walk through it...

18:34.991 --> 18:36.659
through the wall...

18:37.911 --> 18:42.081
Just like a few minutes ago
when I took a running bash,

18:42.582 --> 18:46.753
and I failed horribly.

18:54.010 --> 18:56.304
I am punishing the atoms.

18:56.638 --> 18:59.224
I am making an example of them...

19:00.266 --> 19:03.436
An object lesson, a thing...

19:05.021 --> 19:07.607
... so when the other atoms see what's coming,

19:08.399 --> 19:10.235
they'll let me pass through.

19:10.735 --> 19:14.781
Independent snots!
Shape up of ship out!

19:16.491 --> 19:18.034
- May I?
- No.

19:25.792 --> 19:30.922
Your grip is very very strong.

19:31.047 --> 19:36.261
I think, that your problem lies
in the properties of the hammer.

19:36.302 --> 19:37.720
Interesting theory...

19:38.388 --> 19:40.473
May I keep it for study?

19:40.473 --> 19:43.059
You're not gonna play with it or anything?

19:43.309 --> 19:44.352
No I won't.

19:45.854 --> 19:48.773
Ok, good night.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.068
Good night, Captain Fairbanks.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.550
Yeah I know,

20:15.550 --> 20:18.761
I had to kill a fifth of scotch
just to get to sleep.

20:19.220 --> 20:23.224
No..no I don't believe in pills.
Sleeping pills keep you awake anyway.

20:24.517 --> 20:27.187
Why should I have to explain that?
Its self-explanatory.

20:28.146 --> 20:29.939
You want me to explain it? Alright...

20:30.231 --> 20:32.942
In a very short time,
you build up tolerance, right?

20:35.695 --> 20:37.155
That's right? You got it.

20:38.281 --> 20:40.241
Anyway..he's here.

20:41.784 --> 20:43.411
Yeah, yesterday.

20:45.455 --> 20:49.000
No, I don't know.
Its too soon to tell.

20:52.504 --> 20:53.713
Yes, I will.

20:54.214 --> 20:55.256
Yes, I will.

20:56.257 --> 20:58.259
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

21:10.146 --> 21:11.272
Jesus.

21:16.486 --> 21:19.197
Don't blame me,
I told them not to operate.

21:23.159 --> 21:25.453
Welcome to Transylvania.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.165
Do you plan to get dressed?

21:29.165 --> 21:32.168
How the hell can I get dressed when
Lieutinant Fromme won't surrender my pants?

21:32.168 --> 21:34.254
- You don't want me to rip them off!
- No.

21:34.254 --> 21:36.464
You bet your ass it will wrinkle your pants.

21:36.673 --> 21:37.590
Here you go.

21:37.841 --> 21:39.926
Case histories on the men.

21:39.926 --> 21:42.554
I've been through them all,
and have learnt nothing.

21:43.638 --> 21:46.099
I think this boar was a diabetic.

21:47.934 --> 21:49.143
May I come in?

21:49.227 --> 21:51.145
- Oh, heck.
- Thats yours.

21:51.229 --> 21:52.564
So thats your couch...

21:52.605 --> 21:55.191
Why don't you make it better nailed..

21:55.191 --> 21:58.027
so that we can all see the blood pouring out?

21:58.194 --> 22:00.822
- Cutshaw, the astronaut.
- I would say yes.

22:00.947 --> 22:01.990
God of mine...

22:02.448 --> 22:03.992
You are the new boy, huh?

22:04.075 --> 22:05.660
I'm Colonel Hudson Kane.

22:06.119 --> 22:08.496
- Do I call you Hud?
- Try calling him Colonel.

22:08.788 --> 22:10.498
Are you the one that makes the chicken?

22:10.874 --> 22:12.083
Coronel Kane's a psychiatrist.

22:12.417 --> 22:14.752
Sure...
And they told me you were a doctor.

22:15.295 --> 22:18.423
This man treats crocodiles for acne!

22:18.548 --> 22:19.883
Why make my point?

22:20.633 --> 22:24.137
Pack up and leave, Hud.
You're on the way out.

22:24.179 --> 22:26.347
I'm acting on orders, so to inform.

22:26.347 --> 22:28.391
Who ordered you, Cutshaw?

22:28.433 --> 22:31.978
Unseen forces far too numerous to enumerate.

22:32.187 --> 22:34.397
Check the file;
Its all in the file...

22:44.657 --> 22:45.533
Here it is.

22:47.327 --> 22:48.661
Now read it, Hud.

22:48.745 --> 22:51.039
Read it out loud.Its my therapy

22:51.039 --> 22:52.248
Why don't we-

22:52.290 --> 22:55.376
Read it! Or I will go crazy, dammit!
I swear it!

22:55.418 --> 22:57.003
And you will be responsible.

22:58.671 --> 23:00.548
Alright, Cutshaw.
Please sit down.

23:04.511 --> 23:06.804
I think the end of the world just came...

23:06.846 --> 23:09.766
... for the bag of Fritos in my pocket.

23:09.849 --> 23:12.602
Would you please tell Fromme I'd like my pants?

23:12.644 --> 23:14.103
Consider the lilies of the field.

23:21.152 --> 23:22.612
I'm waiting...

23:31.871 --> 23:35.250
Two days prior to a scheduled space shot,

23:35.834 --> 23:38.670
subject officer, while dining on the base,

23:39.170 --> 23:42.924
was observed to pick up a plastic ketchup bottle...

23:43.633 --> 23:47.345
squeeze a thin red line across his throat,

23:48.638 --> 23:52.684
and then to stagger and fall
very heavily across the table...

23:53.476 --> 23:58.398
...then being occupied by the director
of the National Space Administration,

23:59.065 --> 24:00.275
gurgling...

24:02.068 --> 24:05.572
"Don't-order-the-swordfish"

24:09.492 --> 24:12.328
You're looking at my medal, Hud.
Stop looking at my medal.

24:12.328 --> 24:14.122
- No, I'm not...
- Yes, you were.

24:14.289 --> 24:15.582
You covet it!

24:15.874 --> 24:16.916
On the following morning...

24:16.916 --> 24:19.502
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, it's...

24:19.669 --> 24:22.714
Son of a bitch! I knew it.

24:23.214 --> 24:24.465
You were looking at it.

24:24.465 --> 24:27.844
- Sorry.
- Sorry? What good is 'sorry'?

24:28.094 --> 24:29.929
I'm a nervous wreck.

24:30.054 --> 24:32.223
Christ, how can I sleep now?

24:32.265 --> 24:34.559
waiting for a covetous kleptomaniacal
colonel...

24:34.601 --> 24:37.395
.. to come creeping around to my bedside...

24:37.478 --> 24:39.147
... to rip away my medal!

24:39.230 --> 24:40.773
If I were to do that, you might awaken.

24:41.274 --> 24:43.067
Like hell I'll awake.

24:43.401 --> 24:47.030
Powerful drugs could be
insinuated into my soup.

24:51.117 --> 24:52.577
The following morning...

24:52.785 --> 24:55.788
Covety is a sin.

24:59.584 --> 25:01.794
The following morning at 0500...

25:02.462 --> 25:05.507
Subject officer entered the space craft,

25:10.803 --> 25:15.350
and upon recieving instruction from
Control to begin his countdown...

25:15.934 --> 25:20.897
... he was heard instead to say:
"I am frankly sick of being used"

25:21.773 --> 25:23.107
Sometime later,

25:23.775 --> 25:28.363
subject officer plainly stated that:
"Going the moon was naughty, impolite...

25:28.446 --> 25:31.866
... uncouth, and in any case...

25:31.908 --> 25:33.660
... bad for his skin"

25:35.954 --> 25:39.290
- What's the matter? You think that's funny?
- No no, no I don't.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.793
Pack up and leave, Hud.

25:42.544 --> 25:43.670
I've had it!

25:44.629 --> 25:46.714
Cutshaw,
why won't you go to the moon?

25:46.756 --> 25:50.635
Why do camels have humps... and cobras, none?

25:50.760 --> 25:51.886
Why won't you go?

25:51.886 --> 25:54.764
The man in the moon tried to fuck my sister.

25:54.806 --> 25:57.934
- Cutshaw...
- The truth of the matter, is that Custer...

25:57.976 --> 26:00.645
... called Sitting Bull a spic.

26:02.939 --> 26:04.107
Reasons are dangerous.

26:04.482 --> 26:05.900
What the hell is this?

26:06.317 --> 26:08.278
"How I believe" by Teilhard?

26:13.491 --> 26:15.368
Show me a catholic,

26:15.451 --> 26:17.412
and I'll show you a junkie.

26:21.583 --> 26:22.792
Dr. Fell.

26:25.003 --> 26:29.299
Once again that fiendish man has
given me that horrible Mark of Fairbanks.

26:29.549 --> 26:31.134
Look, I am Bleeding.

26:31.426 --> 26:33.928
This wound's not self-inflicted?

26:35.346 --> 26:37.307
Mi coronelito...

26:37.724 --> 26:39.017
You are not well.

26:39.350 --> 26:41.352
- No, I'm fine.Thank you.
- Your coloring...

26:41.769 --> 26:44.522
... is absolutely bilious.

26:45.481 --> 26:46.900
Kane, look out!

26:50.737 --> 26:56.826
I want your name, batch number and
name of every other boar in your group.

26:57.285 --> 26:59.871
You have the right to remain silent.

27:01.164 --> 27:02.916
No a Portrait of Jenny, perhaps..

27:04.250 --> 27:11.090
but atleast, no more Dorian Gray!
Ciao!

27:15.512 --> 27:17.430
I know you want to be an artist.

27:22.268 --> 27:25.813
Okay, I'm absolutely ready for my
ink-blot test now. I absolutely flips me!

27:26.147 --> 27:29.234
Now, while you're fresh with
all those roses in your cheeks...

27:29.275 --> 27:31.611
- Cutshaw...
- He's a psychiatrist!

27:32.195 --> 27:34.447
"My god Rick, help me!"

27:34.614 --> 27:36.324
Casablanca.

27:38.952 --> 27:40.828
Alright Cutshaw, please sit down.

27:59.013 --> 28:00.056
What do you see?

28:00.098 --> 28:03.434
An old woman in funny clothes blowing
poisoned darts at a buffalo.

28:03.476 --> 28:04.769
Bison.

28:10.108 --> 28:11.317
I'm waiting.

28:14.737 --> 28:17.282
My whole life rushing past me in an instant.

28:18.032 --> 28:21.160
- This one?
- Kafka talking to a bedbug.

28:21.536 --> 28:22.579
Correct.

28:22.704 --> 28:25.748
- You're full of shit. You know that?
- I thought it was Kafka.

28:25.623 --> 28:27.959
You wouldn't know Kafka
from Betty Davis.

28:28.084 --> 28:30.211
And you, you're a mental case.

28:30.336 --> 28:34.048
- Yes, maybe I am.
- Ingratiating bastard.

28:34.632 --> 28:37.218
Do you always play kiss-ass
with the loonies?

28:37.552 --> 28:39.846
- No.
- I like you Kane, You're regular.

28:43.183 --> 28:46.060
Take the medal,
I'll take this book.

28:46.186 --> 28:47.520
What book?

28:49.272 --> 28:52.400
"I Remember Mamma"
by Oedipus Rex.

29:02.452 --> 29:05.914
- May I go?
- You're gone, you're gone...

29:29.562 --> 29:31.606
- Saint Christopher.
- Protect us.

29:37.195 --> 29:39.948
- There's something engraved on the back of it.
- Ora pro nobis?

29:42.033 --> 29:43.952
"I'm a buddhist...

29:44.160 --> 29:47.747
... In case of an accident, call a lama"

29:53.503 --> 29:55.213
What's Cutshaw's religion?

29:55.380 --> 29:57.674
I don't know.
Read the file; it's all in the file.

30:01.469 --> 30:03.221
Elementary psychology.

30:05.056 --> 30:06.432
Well, here are my pants.

30:09.936 --> 30:10.979
What's this?

30:11.062 --> 30:12.438
I think it's a dog.

30:13.147 --> 30:14.607
Goddammit, not the pants!

30:17.652 --> 30:21.072
Ah, there you are!
Why do I have to put up with your
temperament this early in the morning?

30:22.323 --> 30:24.701
Sorry Colonel. It's hard to keep track of -

30:24.742 --> 30:27.495
- Major Groper, let it be.
- But Colonel!

30:27.662 --> 30:30.748
Alright. The men may see me whenever they need to.

30:30.832 --> 30:32.792
You heard?

30:33.001 --> 30:34.669
Whatever you say, sir.

30:37.297 --> 30:40.633
Quit drinking buttermilk Daiquiris
in the closet, Groper.

30:43.011 --> 30:45.930
That man is a lunatic and dangerous.

30:46.264 --> 30:48.933
Once when I was walking the grounds,

30:49.017 --> 30:51.186
I hear his whispering and I look...

30:51.728 --> 30:57.358
And up in the branches of a cypress tree
there's Groper the crazy bastard
talking in whispers with an owl.

30:57.525 --> 31:01.487
- What?
- A big black and white owl. They're common.

31:02.155 --> 31:04.115
I could'nt testify what they were saying.

31:04.365 --> 31:06.534
They were whispering... you understand me?

31:06.826 --> 31:10.163
I couldn't hear them clearly.
And what I don't know for a fact, I don't say.

31:10.246 --> 31:12.290
That's the kind of hairpin I am.

31:12.874 --> 31:16.252
Reno...

31:12.874 --> 31:16.252
No, Sir, the words weren't clear.
Really sir, believe me.

31:16.419 --> 31:18.421
But there is no cypress tree on the ground.

31:18.505 --> 31:21.883
Doctor, its easy to dig up a tree...

31:22.342 --> 31:25.887
...and then anyone with money
can fill in the hole.

31:26.304 --> 31:27.514
I didn't think of that.

31:27.889 --> 31:30.141
No, you didn't.

31:30.350 --> 31:31.601
Is this your dog?

31:31.684 --> 31:33.436
What does it look like? My zebra?

31:34.187 --> 31:36.022
- What do you call him?
- Irresponsible...

31:36.022 --> 31:38.399
... he's ten minutes late for rehearsal.

31:38.441 --> 31:40.610
Out, Sir Lawrence.

31:42.862 --> 31:46.533
Lieutenant Reno is adapting
Shakespeare's plays for dogs.

31:46.574 --> 31:49.827
A labor of love! A fucking headache!
But goddammit, somebody's got to do it!

31:50.203 --> 31:53.373
We are just getting into Julius Ceasar.
Want to come to rehearsal?

31:53.831 --> 31:58.169
We're doing that terribly gripping scene
where this very noble-looking dalmatian...

31:58.378 --> 32:02.590
... whips his toga around himself - thusly...

32:03.758 --> 32:06.803
and snarls "Et tu, White Fang?"

32:06.886 --> 32:09.889
I'd like to ask your opinion
about a problem in Hamlet.

32:10.181 --> 32:14.269
You see, if i cast a Great Dane in the role,
they're gonna accuse me of -

32:10.181 --> 32:14.269
Frankie, look...

32:16.688 --> 32:19.315
Lieutenant Spinell,
my casting director.

32:19.899 --> 32:21.901
- Hi fellas.
- We're looking for talent.

32:22.110 --> 32:24.320
So far this production is a one-dog-show.

32:25.822 --> 32:26.990
Who's that?

32:27.615 --> 32:30.285
That dog may be Rosencrantz
or Guildenstern.

32:30.869 --> 32:34.706
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are males,
this dog is a female.

32:35.456 --> 32:36.666
So we take a license.

32:37.333 --> 32:40.336
Get the fuck out of here.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.589
Ok, I was only suggesting.

32:45.675 --> 32:46.718
Sorry.

32:47.719 --> 32:48.803
Quiet, Sir Lawrence!

32:48.845 --> 32:52.098
Jesus, why do I live like this!
One moment and he thinks
 he's Barbara Streisand.

32:55.018 --> 32:58.646
Read the classics. It improves
the whole respiratory system.

33:03.902 --> 33:05.028
Adiós.

33:10.450 --> 33:13.077
Quiet! I asked for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
And what did you bring me?

33:13.119 --> 33:16.998
Tiny Alice!
I want dobermans, I want even a collie...

33:17.081 --> 33:18.791
Stop breaking my balls!

33:20.460 --> 33:21.252
Fairbanks...

33:23.087 --> 33:25.673
It is one of my multiple personalities...

33:26.216 --> 33:28.468
I am sister Eve Black.

33:29.344 --> 33:30.762
I understand...

33:31.095 --> 33:35.016
"The little Sisters of the poor"
is a recognised charity, Krebs.

33:35.225 --> 33:36.643
Fuck off.

33:39.312 --> 33:40.855
They're all that bad?

33:41.356 --> 33:43.733
He was flying those planes we got
from the Germans, you know..

33:43.733 --> 33:46.319
...the ones that take off from the
vertical and then fly straight?

33:46.694 --> 33:49.239
24 of the damned things crashed
for no reason at all...

33:49.531 --> 33:52.408
And right after number 24, Fairbanks found
out that he could talk to trees.

33:53.117 --> 33:54.619
You think they're faking it, then?

33:54.744 --> 33:56.871
I don't know..I just got back myself a week ago.

33:59.832 --> 34:01.376
Biggest mystery is Cutshaw, I guess.

34:01.543 --> 34:02.877
Why him?

34:02.919 --> 34:05.630
Well, he wasn't in combat...
So why should he fake it?

34:05.672 --> 34:08.800
And what about Reno? That man owns a
Congressional medal of honor.

34:08.842 --> 34:11.010
He's pretending insanity to get out of combat?

34:12.344 --> 34:14.848
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
They all have high IQs.

34:14.973 --> 34:17.225
Some of them genius, matter-of-fact.

34:17.684 --> 34:19.811
And most other fakery I've heard about from the corps...

34:19.811 --> 34:23.940
... comes under the category of falling
out of parade in front of a reviewing stand
and then urinating,

34:23.982 --> 34:26.900
...preferably on some field-grade officer's leg.

34:29.070 --> 34:30.112
I don't know.

34:31.155 --> 34:33.491
Maybe we are just fish out of the water.

34:33.533 --> 34:34.784
What was that?

34:36.744 --> 34:38.496
I just think about...

34:38.871 --> 34:41.206
sickness...

34:41.748 --> 34:43.710
cancer in children...

34:44.418 --> 34:46.504
earthquakes, war...

34:47.964 --> 34:49.841
...painful death.

34:51.592 --> 34:53.344
Death.

34:55.763 --> 34:57.348
Just death.

34:58.975 --> 35:02.145
If these things are just part of our natural environment...

35:02.187 --> 35:04.898
Why do we think of them as evil?

35:05.190 --> 35:07.358
Why do they horrify us so?

35:07.775 --> 35:10.695
...unless we were meant for someplace else.

35:11.905 --> 35:15.241
I don't think evil grows out of madness.

35:16.534 --> 35:19.621
I think madness grows out of evil.

35:20.622 --> 35:21.956
Hell, I don't know.

35:23.458 --> 35:26.419
Maybe I'll give them all shock treatment, you know.

35:28.379 --> 35:30.048
Might shake out the phonies, what do you think?

35:32.675 --> 35:33.426
You hate it.

35:37.889 --> 35:39.182
Well I'll see you later.

37:39.177 --> 37:41.721
SHOCK TREATMENT - CURATIVE

37:51.105 --> 37:55.527
What're you holding... ?

38:04.118 --> 38:05.119
All secure, sir.

38:06.579 --> 38:07.914
Sargeant Krebs.

38:09.082 --> 38:11.918
Please tell  Colonel Fell
I want to see him.

38:12.794 --> 38:15.171
Colonel Fell has signed out for the day, sir.

38:15.839 --> 38:18.508
Capitain Bennish may need a thorazine injection.

38:19.008 --> 38:21.052
Who has a key to the drug locker?

38:22.136 --> 38:23.263
Only Colonel Fell, sir.

38:24.097 --> 38:25.306
Sargeant Krebs.

38:26.349 --> 38:30.186
Please tell Colonel Fell I need to see
him as soon as he gets back.

38:30.687 --> 38:32.397
Yes, sir. I will.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.525
- Good night, Sargeant.
- Good night, Sir.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.197
Close the door please, Krebs.

39:25.200 --> 39:28.453
Colonel, what are you holding...?

39:28.620 --> 39:32.207
You cut off his head with a wire
and he kept on talking...

39:32.498 --> 39:35.084
...Colonel, he was just a boy.

39:39.923 --> 39:41.591
Let's go to the beach.

39:41.966 --> 39:43.968
It's night, and it's raining.

39:48.515 --> 39:51.059
I see you're determined to start an argument.

39:51.309 --> 39:52.644
Go to bed, please.

39:53.770 --> 39:57.857
Hud, there is nothing less attractive
than a psychiatrist who pouts.

39:58.274 --> 40:00.902
What do I have to do to just get in a word with you?

40:01.569 --> 40:03.071
Offer sacrifice?

40:06.658 --> 40:07.825
Then, here!

40:11.871 --> 40:13.331
I brought you a mud-pie.

40:13.748 --> 40:15.250
Now, can I talk to you?

40:16.417 --> 40:17.836
Will you talk about the moon?

40:18.628 --> 40:21.339
Listen, everyone knows that
the moon is Roquefort.

40:22.215 --> 40:24.467
I've come here to talk about Colonel Fell.

40:25.134 --> 40:27.846
- What about him?
- Major Nammack approached him this morning,

40:28.388 --> 40:30.890
complaining of a strange and wondrous illness.

40:31.599 --> 40:34.227
And do you know what that
heartless butcher prescribed?

40:35.144 --> 40:37.021
He said "Here, take this...

40:36.938 --> 40:40.441
... It's a suicide pill with a
mild laxative side-effect"

40:41.192 --> 40:43.194
What kind of bedside manner is that?

40:43.903 --> 40:45.864
I break the arrow of peace.

40:47.031 --> 40:48.324
Why did you buy that arm-band?

40:48.992 --> 40:50.827
- Because I am in mourning.
- For whom?

40:50.827 --> 40:54.163
For God. If God exists, then he's a fink.
Or more likely a Foot:

40:54.205 --> 40:57.500
A giant all-knowing all-powerful Foot.

40:57.792 --> 40:59.919
I don't belong to God...

40:59.961 --> 41:02.213
... so I don't have to hide
in an Argentina Club.

41:02.463 --> 41:04.424
But I believe in the Devil alright.

41:04.632 --> 41:06.134
You know why?

41:06.259 --> 41:08.428
Because the prick keeps doing commercials.

41:08.428 --> 41:10.638
The Original sin might be real.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.056
Hello, operator?

41:12.307 --> 41:14.058
Maybe it is something genetic.

41:14.392 --> 41:16.060
Can you prove there is a Foot?

41:16.436 --> 41:18.730
There are some arguments for reason.

41:19.022 --> 41:23.735
Are those the things that we used to
justify dropping atomic bombs on Japan?

41:25.236 --> 41:27.572
I am sorry we have to rush the job like this, Fell.

41:28.031 --> 41:31.576
When I got into what we were trying, we hit the
ceiling. We needed all the help we could get.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.827
And in a hell of a hurry.

41:34.370 --> 41:37.332
- Think we convinced him?
- Oh yeah, he bought it.

41:37.832 --> 41:40.001
- God, I hope so.
- I know how you feel.

41:40.668 --> 41:42.337
You do?

41:42.837 --> 41:44.547
No, I guess I don't.

41:45.882 --> 41:47.425
Well that's life, huh?

41:48.259 --> 41:50.428
Take it easy, now.

41:50.512 --> 41:52.931
- I sure hope it all works out for you.
- Yeah.

41:54.307 --> 41:56.768
Every kind thought thought
is the hope of the world, right?

41:57.435 --> 41:58.520
See you later.

42:07.362 --> 42:08.363
Good luck.

42:15.537 --> 42:18.623
- Horacio...
- Get me a grey hound.

42:28.591 --> 42:31.302
I said get me a grey hound.

42:32.053 --> 42:35.723
- Grey hound.
- That's right...

42:36.683 --> 42:38.268
Pekingese.

42:38.476 --> 42:40.395
And you'll play three feet off the ground?

42:41.604 --> 42:43.982
I want people to wonder about him.

42:43.982 --> 42:45.650
I don't know.

42:46.025 --> 42:49.779
- Why the fuck are you bothering me?
- Polonius...

42:49.863 --> 42:52.407
My Laertes is supposed to be a foil to Hamlet.

42:52.407 --> 42:53.575
Polonius...

42:53.616 --> 42:56.160
- I swear I'm going to hit you in the mouth.
- Polonius...

42:56.369 --> 42:59.122
- Un Chow.
- Labrador...

43:03.751 --> 43:05.545
What the fuck are you doing?

43:05.587 --> 43:07.714
I think he's suffocating.

43:07.881 --> 43:09.674
Good night, sweetheart.

43:41.039 --> 43:42.665
Colonel?

43:44.751 --> 43:47.754
I am telling you Kane is the one who's crazy.

43:48.046 --> 43:52.258
He just sat there doing this. All the time - doing this!

43:52.967 --> 43:54.594
Hell he never even saw me!

43:55.261 --> 43:59.432
I want you to drop like an overripe mango.

44:00.058 --> 44:03.978
A lot of psychiatrists are deeply disturbed.

44:05.688 --> 44:08.483
They've got the highest suicide
rate of any profession in the world..

44:08.525 --> 44:10.610
Now that's a fact, you can check it Captain Billy.

44:12.862 --> 44:14.906
What the hell were you doing at the clinic?

44:15.156 --> 44:17.242
I had cookies in my teeth...

44:17.367 --> 44:19.911
... raisins and crap like that, you know.

44:19.994 --> 44:21.955
I needed some dental floss.

44:24.332 --> 44:25.500
I'm telling you...

44:25.500 --> 44:28.169
He is Gregory Peck
in Spellbound.

44:28.837 --> 44:32.423
He comes to take over the mental asylum,
and he's nuts himself.

44:32.507 --> 44:34.676
I swear it, it's just like that picture.

44:36.845 --> 44:39.347
I took a fork and a tablecloth in front of him...

44:39.389 --> 44:42.100
... I made ski tracks and he fainted.

44:43.601 --> 44:46.980
Would you kindly have the goodness to admit
that you are able read my thoughts?

44:47.105 --> 44:49.691
...that my space-ship crashed on the planet Venus...

44:49.732 --> 44:52.277
...that this is Venus
and you are a Venusian!

44:52.402 --> 44:55.238
That you have ILLEGALLY invaded my mind,

44:55.280 --> 44:56.865
making me believe that I am still on earth,

44:56.906 --> 44:59.242
with some demonic hypnotic illusion!

44:59.284 --> 45:01.369
This is NOT earth!
You're NOT an earthman!

45:01.411 --> 45:04.622
I'm standing here with fungus upto my ass,
you bastard.

45:04.706 --> 45:06.374
And you're a giant brain!

45:06.374 --> 45:09.169
Please give me back my flying-belt.
I won't use it to escape..

45:09.169 --> 45:11.379
..I swear to God, I won't. Give me the flying -

45:11.880 --> 45:14.174
I wanna play Tinkerbell...

45:14.174 --> 45:16.676
...in a drag in a fungoid
production of Peter Pan.

45:16.676 --> 45:18.803
Can I help you with anything, sir?

45:19.554 --> 45:21.306
Medication is indicated here.

45:21.681 --> 45:23.266
Colonel Fell isn't back yet, sir.

45:23.558 --> 45:25.894
Yeah he isn't up, like you know where he is?
He's up there with my flying-belt.

45:26.102 --> 45:29.522
You're giving me back my flying-belt!
I want my flying-belt back!

45:32.233 --> 45:35.320
Michael, I want you to be calm.
I want you to be calm.

45:35.445 --> 45:39.115
There are lots of sick people in this house,
and many of them are sleeping.

45:39.407 --> 45:41.701
This is embarrasing, I'm terribly sorry.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.923
- Captain Cutshaw.
- Vincent.

45:56.633 --> 46:01.763
In order for life to appear spontaneously on earth...

46:02.430 --> 46:07.310
... there first had to be hundreds of
millions of protein molecules...

46:07.727 --> 46:11.314
- ...of the ninth configuration.
- Vincent.

46:12.565 --> 46:15.860
But given the size of the planet Earth...

46:16.569 --> 46:21.407
do you know how long it would take for
just one of these protein molecules...

46:21.574 --> 46:24.577
... to appear entirely by chance?

46:24.786 --> 46:26.663
Vincent...

46:27.539 --> 46:36.256
Roughly 10 to the 243rd power
billions of years.

46:37.882 --> 46:42.262
And I find that far far more fantastic...

46:42.887 --> 46:46.307
...than simply believing in God.

47:02.490 --> 47:03.449
Colonel, what are you...

47:07.871 --> 47:10.790
Shouldn't sleep like that; wrinkles the pants.

47:14.169 --> 47:16.880
- What time is it?
- 8:15.

47:17.547 --> 47:18.756
Got a word you were looking for me?

47:19.841 --> 47:21.509
Where were you?

47:21.509 --> 47:24.012
Personal matters,
I've got an uncle in trouble.

47:24.846 --> 47:26.639
Any way I can help?

47:26.931 --> 47:29.601
No, we're doing what we can.
Appreciate it though, thanks.
What's up?

47:34.272 --> 47:36.649
Captain Bennish could use some sedation.

47:39.027 --> 47:41.738
Please, might I have the duplicate
key to the drug-chest?

47:41.905 --> 47:43.448
We had to break into it..

47:43.615 --> 47:45.575
I think it'll be better if we both had a key.

47:45.825 --> 47:48.077
Boy you look beat... didn't you get sleep?

47:48.912 --> 47:52.749
Every time I dropped off, another
one of the men was at the door.

47:52.790 --> 47:55.418
- Keep it closed.
- No.

47:55.668 --> 47:58.588
They've got to be able to talk to
me every time they need to.

47:58.963 --> 47:59.964
It's upto you.

48:10.642 --> 48:11.976
Something wrong?

48:15.021 --> 48:16.314
Something right?

48:17.232 --> 48:19.859
- That dream.
- I didn't get you.

48:23.655 --> 48:27.116
I just flashed on this dream I keep having.

48:28.117 --> 48:30.453
Julius Caesar's wife said to Sigmund Freud,
you tell me yours and I'll tell you mine.

48:30.453 --> 48:32.705
- It isn't my dream.
- I didn't get you.

48:35.667 --> 48:39.712
I said...it isn't my dream.

48:40.255 --> 48:41.422
Was it rented?

48:49.889 --> 48:51.266
A patient of mine,

48:52.725 --> 48:54.644
a Colonel at Vietnam,

48:56.229 --> 49:01.734
he had this grotesque recurring nightmare.

49:03.695 --> 49:07.365
Something that happened to him in combat.

49:10.285 --> 49:12.829
Ever since he told me about it,

49:15.498 --> 49:16.958
I keep dreaming it.

49:17.750 --> 49:18.418
Jesus.

49:20.128 --> 49:21.296
Yeah, strange.

49:21.671 --> 49:24.382
Weird is the word..that's carrying
transferance a little far, isn't it?

49:27.594 --> 49:29.929
- It was my brother.
- The patient?

49:30.180 --> 49:31.556
- Yes.
- Oh my God.

49:31.723 --> 49:32.849
Twin brother?

49:35.018 --> 49:36.519
No.

49:39.063 --> 49:41.774
Yeah, but; that would still explain it,
wouldn't it? I mean a...

49:43.610 --> 49:45.778
You're psychically attuned.
You're brothers. You're close...

49:45.945 --> 49:48.615
- No, we're not.
- But you must be.

49:50.783 --> 49:52.410
Fell.

49:53.203 --> 49:55.955
Have you ever heard of 'Killer' Kane?

49:56.039 --> 49:57.081
Buck Rogers?

49:57.790 --> 50:01.669
No, 'Killer' Kane the Marine.

50:02.504 --> 50:05.965
Oh yeah, sure. The guerilla-warfare guy who
killed thirty-forty guys with his hands.

50:07.133 --> 50:08.134
More than that.

50:10.094 --> 50:11.137
What's the point?

50:13.515 --> 50:15.058
Me is my brother.

50:15.517 --> 50:16.518
Bullshit.

50:17.268 --> 50:18.186
No, it's true.

50:18.645 --> 50:19.229
You're kidding!

50:20.313 --> 50:21.773
I wish I were.

50:23.900 --> 50:25.318
Uh-oh; you two guys don't get along huh?

50:27.111 --> 50:28.446
What's the beef?

50:31.241 --> 50:32.367
He's a murderer.

50:32.951 --> 50:34.327
He's a Marine.

50:34.327 --> 50:36.913
He gets dropped behind the enemy
lines and does his duty.

50:37.247 --> 50:38.706
Just forget it.

50:38.915 --> 50:41.125
Are you sure you know what business you're in?

50:41.167 --> 50:44.337
These recruiting-office sergeants
can be pretty sneaky sometimes.

50:44.379 --> 50:47.173
Vincent...

50:48.341 --> 50:49.634
You a friend of Jane Fonda?

50:52.053 --> 50:53.805
- We're close.
- You're kidding.

50:54.430 --> 50:55.682
I'm kidding.

51:02.438 --> 51:03.398
Drugs.

51:05.567 --> 51:06.693
What was that?

51:07.443 --> 51:09.362
So many of these doctors get hooked on drugs.

51:15.410 --> 51:18.788
Hey, how is your brother by the way?
You know I met him once over in Korea.

51:19.539 --> 51:21.666
Kind of palled around, we guys; matter-of-fact.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.419
I liked him. I liked him a helluva lot.

51:27.714 --> 51:28.673
He's dead.

51:29.841 --> 51:31.718
Oh, holy Christ. Hey, I'm sorry.

51:32.635 --> 51:34.429
- I'm really sorry.
- Its alright.

51:37.390 --> 51:38.433
Yes, come in.

51:39.434 --> 51:42.145
Colonel Kane,
could I see you for a second?

51:42.687 --> 51:44.314
Well I gotta go you guys, I'll see you later.

52:07.921 --> 52:12.342
To my darling, my dearest,
my flaming secret love.

52:13.218 --> 52:17.555
How I've hungered for this moment,
when I may rip away my mask...

52:18.139 --> 52:21.518
...and unburden by aching bleeding heart.

52:21.976 --> 52:27.774
My sweetest, I saw you but an instant; a semi-instant;
yet I knew I was your slave.

52:28.816 --> 52:35.448
Wondorous creature, I adore you!
You are sandalwood from Nineveh,
truffles from the moon...

52:36.241 --> 52:40.912
In my dreams, I am a madman.

52:41.287 --> 52:46.918
Yes! I rip away your dress, and then your bra,
and then your glasses, and I-

52:48.044 --> 52:51.047
- Groper, is this necessary?
- Look at the signature.

52:56.177 --> 52:58.972
Major Marvin Groper.

52:59.556 --> 53:03.768
Sir, I got phone call after phone call this
morning from broads who got letters like this one.

53:04.602 --> 53:06.145
Where did you get this?

53:07.105 --> 53:10.692
- Well sir, some of the women, they -
- Women?

53:11.317 --> 53:14.737
- Well, they happened to come here today and -
- Happened?

53:16.072 --> 53:17.198
Well sir; I asked them...

53:17.824 --> 53:19.742
- ...ones with the nice voices.
- Groper.

53:20.118 --> 53:23.121
They are ugly, sir!
Ugly as sin!

53:23.413 --> 53:27.542
And I think the bastard who wrote all those letters
needs some kind of punishment and restriction, sir!

53:28.459 --> 53:30.670
Who wrote this letter?

53:30.795 --> 53:33.423
Look at the envelope, sir.
The address...

53:33.715 --> 53:37.385
Sir, there's only one mind here who is this diabolical!

53:38.136 --> 53:44.726
See that? Its made up to look like its been mimeoed.
Like its part of a mass commercial mailing, sir.

53:45.476 --> 53:46.936
"To : Occupant"

53:51.941 --> 53:53.902
Some of this stuuff's just got to stop, sir.

53:54.819 --> 53:57.030
Maybe so, Groper. Yes.

53:58.031 --> 53:59.574
It's getting out of hand.

54:00.575 --> 54:01.618
Yes.

54:02.827 --> 54:06.164
Maybe we do need a few restrictions.

54:06.873 --> 54:08.166
Colonel.

54:10.043 --> 54:11.336
Colonel.

54:12.462 --> 54:14.589
 -I'm in trouble, I need help. Immediate help.
 -Take an enema; call me soon.

54:16.132 --> 54:18.259
Dr. Fell, you're wanted in surgery.

54:18.885 --> 54:20.512
I've been having an argument, a monster...

54:20.803 --> 54:23.139
...and I'll like you to settle it once and for all.

54:31.064 --> 54:33.525
Some Shakespearean-
Hold this please.

54:34.234 --> 54:36.361
Some Shakespearean scho -
Thank you.

54:38.029 --> 54:42.325
Some Shakespearean scholars say that when
Hamlet is pretending he's crazy...

54:42.534 --> 54:44.661
...he really is crazy,
Correct?

54:42.534 --> 54:44.661
That's right.

54:45.245 --> 54:48.706
Now other Shakespearean scholars
say that when Hamlet...

54:56.297 --> 54:59.467
Other Shakespearean scholars say that
when Hamlet is pretending to be nuts...

54:59.676 --> 55:03.304
...he really isn't nuts, its an act.
Please give me your opinion.

55:03.513 --> 55:05.807
I would like to hear your's first.

55:06.015 --> 55:09.060
Terrific psychiatrist.
That's class.

55:12.355 --> 55:13.815
Pretty...

55:15.024 --> 55:18.611
Why don't you go inoculate a fucking armadillo, Fell?

55:18.653 --> 55:20.738
No really, I'm interested. I'm terribly interested.

55:21.155 --> 55:26.619
Your interests are coextensive
with on Nero's ass on Sunday morning.

55:26.953 --> 55:28.538
Heady concept, Frankie.

55:30.331 --> 55:34.919
Now listen, Colonel.
considering how Hamlet is acting...

55:35.879 --> 55:38.089
...is he really and truly crazy?

55:38.089 --> 55:40.383
- Yes.
- No.

55:40.758 --> 55:43.052
You're both wrong.

55:45.263 --> 55:47.265
Now think what happens:

55:48.016 --> 55:51.227
First the father dies; then his girl leaves him flat.

55:51.477 --> 55:53.813
then there's the appearance by his father's ghost...

55:54.314 --> 55:58.610
...Bad enough, but then the ghost says he was murdered.
And by whom?

55:58.735 --> 56:03.114
By Hamlet's uncle, who recently married Hamlet's mother!

56:06.951 --> 56:09.579
Now that by itself is a helluva hangup;

56:09.662 --> 56:13.458
because Hamlet liked his mother...

56:15.126 --> 56:16.461
...a lot!

56:16.794 --> 56:19.005
But then we agreed than Hamlet's insane.

56:19.047 --> 56:20.590
No, he's not.

56:20.882 --> 56:23.051
He is pretending,
but...

56:23.718 --> 56:29.140
...if Hamlet hadn't pretended to be crazy,
he would have gone crazy.

56:35.730 --> 56:37.315
See, Hamlet isn't psycho.

56:38.024 --> 56:39.442
He's hanging on a brink.

56:40.735 --> 56:47.200
A little shove, a little teensy eensy little
eensy push, and the kid's gone! Bananas! Whacked out!

56:47.367 --> 56:50.995
So his unconscious mind makes
him do what keeps him sane...

56:51.496 --> 56:54.165
...namely acting like he's nuts!

56:55.250 --> 56:57.585
See 'Cause acting crazy...

56:58.545 --> 57:06.970
...is a way to let off steam; a way to
get rid of your fucking aggression. A way
to get rid of your fears and your terrors...

57:08.096 --> 57:14.853
If I did what Hamlet does in this play,
they'd lock me up; they'd put me in prison.
They'll punish me, sure!

57:16.312 --> 57:22.193
But him? Prince Royal Garbagemouth
gets away with murder. And why?

57:23.736 --> 57:26.281
Because nuts are not responsible!

57:26.322 --> 57:29.576
Meantime, the crazier Hamlet acts...

57:29.742 --> 57:34.581
the more he indulges himself,
the healthier he gets!

57:35.582 --> 57:39.127
- Yes. I think...
- I'm waiting.

57:41.588 --> 57:43.882
I think I agree with your theory.

57:44.007 --> 57:45.758
Yes! There!

57:45.842 --> 57:50.930
You see? You understand that now,
you dumb stupid idiot?

57:51.055 --> 57:53.766
From now on, we do the scene my way!

57:55.101 --> 57:56.477
Come on, Sir Lawrence.

57:56.895 --> 57:59.147
God bless your veins and your arteries, Colonel.

57:59.480 --> 58:01.566
Sir Lawrence,
you don't know shit...

58:03.651 --> 58:05.028
Did he buy it?

58:05.403 --> 58:09.324
Did he buy it?
Hell, I bought it.

58:10.408 --> 58:12.994
Billy, I think there is something wrong with us.

58:34.057 --> 58:35.767
Groper, get off the line.

58:37.018 --> 58:39.103
The Hamlet theory is correct.

58:44.400 --> 58:47.529
Hello, coLonel Kane here.
Get me Captain Pendelton.

58:48.112 --> 58:50.532
Yes, the Quartermaster's office.

58:51.783 --> 58:53.159
Thank you.

58:56.037 --> 58:57.705
We'll need some supplies.

58:58.206 --> 58:59.290
What for?

59:00.792 --> 59:02.794
We're going to indulge the men.

59:04.963 --> 59:08.299
...just like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?

59:08.383 --> 59:11.177
Would you care to enter a comment
on the frog-man suit...

59:11.219 --> 59:13.471
... or the German Gestapo uniforms?

59:15.682 --> 59:17.141
You'll pick the uniforms...

59:18.017 --> 59:19.894
Sure, go ahead...

59:21.437 --> 59:22.772
Oh, I see.

59:24.732 --> 59:27.944
They want tp play
"Great Escape".

59:30.280 --> 59:33.575
And tunnels 1 and 2 are decoys.

59:38.329 --> 59:39.497
Jesus.

59:45.628 --> 59:47.547
- Some weather we are having...
- Jesus.

59:52.760 --> 59:54.929
You are out of uniform.

59:55.680 --> 59:56.931
Jesus.

01:00:01.603 --> 01:00:05.106
Out, take a hike. Out!

01:00:06.691 --> 01:00:09.527
And tell your stupid agent never
to waste any more of my time!

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.115
Can you imagine? Look at that!

01:00:14.157 --> 01:00:17.285
Here I am casting Julius Caesar,
and what do they send me?

01:00:17.327 --> 01:00:18.828
A dog that lisps.

01:00:19.579 --> 01:00:22.248
Spinell, out. Get out.

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.336
You too Nammack.
Get out now, get lost.

01:00:29.172 --> 01:00:31.466
Gimme a reason.
One good reason.

01:00:33.259 --> 01:00:34.302
Colonel, do me a favor? Please?

01:00:34.677 --> 01:00:38.848
Explain to this moron here that in none
of the plays of  Shakespeare...

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:40.975
...can there be a part for Superman.

01:00:41.059 --> 01:00:44.229
There could be, the way I explained it.

01:00:44.229 --> 01:00:45.480
The way you explained! Jesus!

01:00:45.605 --> 01:00:47.232
You know what he wants? You want to hear?

01:00:47.273 --> 01:00:49.609
When the conspirators draw their knives,

01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:51.861
he wants to rescue Julius Caesar!

01:00:51.986 --> 01:00:56.741
Ready? Swoop down like a rocket, pick him
up and go hurdling mighty temples in one
single, incredible bound!

01:00:57.033 --> 01:01:01.287
Jesus, Nammack. Are you crazy?

01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:05.083
Gentlemen, who put the flies in my paint palette?

01:01:06.292 --> 01:01:07.293
Bananas!

01:01:08.962 --> 01:01:12.006
Krebs!
Next.

01:01:13.091 --> 01:01:16.678
Starlet. Look at this!
Did you bring any photographs, honey?

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:22.392
Jesus.

01:01:23.434 --> 01:01:26.271
Go talk to your brother,
I think he has 'The Falling Sickness'.

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:38.575
Put your head up.

01:01:41.703 --> 01:01:45.415
- I'm going to the roof.
- Let go of my stethoscope please.

01:01:45.498 --> 01:01:47.625
Will these people be staying for dinner?

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:50.086
The cook is fixing Mexican.
He wants to know how many.

01:01:50.211 --> 01:01:52.005
I can't get this...the man just threw up.

01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:54.674
I gotta go check on him.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.510
Dr. Fromme, can I talk to you please?

01:02:01.472 --> 01:02:02.849
She bit me.

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:06.811
I told her she was lousy and she bit me.

01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:10.231
Maybe, I ought to use penguins.

01:02:11.357 --> 01:02:14.777
You here that, dammit?
You can be replaced.

01:02:17.322 --> 01:02:20.074
The atoms in water have manners.

01:02:20.325 --> 01:02:24.162
Look. There he is.
Our heavenly shrink.

01:02:24.412 --> 01:02:27.749
You are ours and ours alone and no one else's.

01:02:27.999 --> 01:02:33.379
- Hip, hip...!
- Hurray!

01:03:03.076 --> 01:03:08.957
Colonel, what are you holding...?

01:03:09.374 --> 01:03:11.668
- Colonel, what are you...?
- Jesus! it is...

01:03:19.092 --> 01:03:22.136
Colonel, why do I have to wear this?

01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:23.596
What?

01:03:24.806 --> 01:03:26.599
I said why do I have to wear this?

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.228
Its psychodrama, major.

01:03:31.354 --> 01:03:35.441
Roleplay.
A standard tool for therapy.

01:03:36.192 --> 01:03:40.363
The inmates are playing the role of Allied prisoners of war,

01:03:40.905 --> 01:03:43.199
attemping to tunnel their way through freedom.

01:03:43.199 --> 01:03:45.326
We are their captors.

01:03:45.326 --> 01:03:47.537
Bullshit,
we're their prisoners!

01:03:47.579 --> 01:03:50.331
A bunch of yellow-bellied goof-offs
    out there havin' a ball.

01:03:50.832 --> 01:03:54.169
Why should I have to help their fun,
I'm not a psychiatrist!

01:03:54.335 --> 01:03:57.005
Its a goddam chicken-shit crazy idea.

01:03:58.006 --> 01:04:00.967
Jesus! Jesus Crist, man!

01:04:01.342 --> 01:04:04.304
Why don't you love somebody just a little!

01:04:04.637 --> 01:04:06.848
Why don't you help somebody! Help them!

01:04:07.807 --> 01:04:10.101
help! For the love of Christ!!

01:04:10.435 --> 01:04:13.021
You green-soaked caterpillar-torturing bastard!

01:04:13.271 --> 01:04:16.774
You're going to wear that uniform,
sleep in it, bathe in it.

01:04:16.816 --> 01:04:20.820
Try to take it off and you'll die in it!
Is that clear!

01:04:51.309 --> 01:04:54.479
I claim this swamp for Poland!

01:04:55.146 --> 01:04:58.733
Major Groper, please get out of here.

01:04:58.983 --> 01:05:02.070
Immediately!
And keep that uniform clean.

01:05:10.745 --> 01:05:12.830
The man has a flag-fetish.

01:05:19.379 --> 01:05:23.716
Now, then Major Strasser.
Tomorrow night we're switching roles.

01:05:24.843 --> 01:05:28.012
You'll be the inmates and we'll be the guards.

01:05:28.429 --> 01:05:32.350
Here, study your part for tomorrow night's interrogation.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.728
Notice, incidentally, that you'll crack on page 3.

01:05:37.021 --> 01:05:37.981
Yes.

01:05:40.149 --> 01:05:41.150
Who are you?

01:05:44.237 --> 01:05:45.071
Who are you?

01:05:46.406 --> 01:05:49.242
You're too human to be human.

01:05:55.456 --> 01:05:56.749
I don't know.

01:05:58.334 --> 01:06:00.920
Maybe you're P.T. Barnum.

01:06:01.254 --> 01:06:03.464
P.T. Barnum slaughtered lambs.

01:06:04.215 --> 01:06:06.634
He put up a cage of side shows...

01:06:06.634 --> 01:06:09.137
...and he stuck in a panther and a lamb together.

01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:11.431
And there was never any trouble.

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.934
Huddy, the public just went lollipops.

01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:19.939
Look, a panther and a lamb and they don't even argue!

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:22.650
They don't even  discuss!

01:06:23.568 --> 01:06:26.946
But Hud,
what the public never knew...

01:06:27.488 --> 01:06:30.658
...was that it was never the same lamb.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:36.247
That fucking panther ate up a lamb every single
day at intermission for three hundred days,

01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:39.375
and then they shot him for asking for mint sauce.

01:06:41.503 --> 01:06:45.006
Animals are innocent.
Why should they suffer?

01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:49.177
Why should children suffer?
Will you tell me?

01:06:50.386 --> 01:06:53.515
Why should any baby have to suffer and die?

01:06:53.848 --> 01:06:54.891
Why should men?

01:06:55.850 --> 01:07:00.605
Oh, come on now.
Don't try that thing on me.

01:07:00.605 --> 01:07:02.565
You've got answers for it.

01:07:02.607 --> 01:07:04.901
Like: "Pain makes people noble"

01:07:04.943 --> 01:07:08.571
And how could man be more than a
talking, tennis playing panda bear...

01:07:08.613 --> 01:07:11.824
...if there weren't at least the
possibility of suffering?

01:07:11.991 --> 01:07:14.202
But what about animals, Hud?

01:07:14.202 --> 01:07:17.497
Does pain make turkeys noble?

01:07:17.539 --> 01:07:21.960
Why is all of creation based on dog eat dog,
and the little fish are eaten by the big fish?

01:07:22.126 --> 01:07:24.420
Animals screaming in pain.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:28.007
Our creation an open wound, a fucking slaughterhouse!

01:07:28.049 --> 01:07:30.468
- We've talked about that.
- Not enough!

01:07:30.468 --> 01:07:33.096
We said 'The original sin' might be the cause.

01:07:33.137 --> 01:07:35.723
Then why doesn't the Foot just
come down and tell us?

01:07:35.765 --> 01:07:38.226
Is Foot running short of tablets of stone?

01:07:38.268 --> 01:07:40.854
My Uncle Eddie owns a quarry;
I can get them for him wholesale.

01:07:40.979 --> 01:07:43.106
You're asking for miracles.

01:07:43.106 --> 01:07:46.317
I'm asking Foot to either
shit or get off the pot.

01:07:46.317 --> 01:07:49.487
Diarrhetic strange Gods have
been waiting in the line!

01:07:49.529 --> 01:07:52.115
Maybe God cannot interfere in our affairs.

01:07:52.115 --> 01:07:54.075
So I noticed.

01:07:54.117 --> 01:07:58.037
Maybe He can't because to do so
will spoil his plans for the future.

01:07:58.162 --> 01:08:02.667
Some evolution of man and the world
that's so unthinkably beautiful...

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:06.337
...that its's worth all the pain of
every suffering thing that ever lived.

01:08:06.421 --> 01:08:08.840
I say it's spinach and to hell with it.

01:08:08.882 --> 01:08:11.426
You're convinced that God is dead
because there's evil in the world.

01:08:11.426 --> 01:08:12.635
Correct.

01:08:12.635 --> 01:08:15.763
Then why don't you think He's alive
because of the goodness in the world?

01:08:15.805 --> 01:08:18.808
- What goodness?
- Every where! In man.

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:22.812
- You're commendable.
- If we're nothing but atoms...

01:08:22.854 --> 01:08:27.192
molecular structures no different
in kind from this desk or that pen,

01:08:27.274 --> 01:08:30.278
Then we ought to always be rushing
irresestibly blindly...

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.906
...to our own selfish ends?

01:08:33.281 --> 01:08:36.451
So how is it that there is love in this world?

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:39.662
I mean love as a God might love.

01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:43.291
- And a man will give his life for another.
- Never happened.

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:44.375
Ofcourse it's happened.

01:08:44.584 --> 01:08:47.045
- Give me an example.
- Happens all the time.

01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:49.255
Name one example!

01:08:51.424 --> 01:08:57.346
A soldier throws himself on top of a live grenade
to prevent the other men in his squad from being hit.

01:08:57.388 --> 01:08:59.515
That's reflex action.

01:08:59.557 --> 01:09:02.310
A shipwreck survivor in the middle of an ocean...

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:05.438
... finds out that he has typhoid...

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.899
... and deliberately goes over
 the side of the life-boat...

01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:11.069
... to keep the others in the
boat from contracting the disease.

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:13.196
Now, what do you call that? Reflex action?

01:09:13.238 --> 01:09:15.365
No, I call that suicide.

01:09:15.365 --> 01:09:17.992
Suicide and giving up your life are not the same.

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:19.786
You're so dumb you're adorable.

01:09:19.786 --> 01:09:22.121
The essence of suicide is dispair.

01:09:22.121 --> 01:09:25.375
The essence of suicide is you
don't collect the insurance.

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:29.379
Listen, who doesn't know what all these
examples we keep on hearing about aren't bullshit?

01:09:29.504 --> 01:09:32.799
And don't have some basically bullshit selfish explanation?

01:09:33.049 --> 01:09:34.843
- I know.
- I don't.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:39.013
Now give me just one example - just one -
that you know of personally.

01:09:39.471 --> 01:09:41.599
Personally, just one!

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:55.655
I thought as much.

01:10:05.498 --> 01:10:09.669
Tomorrow's Sunday. Take me to Mass.

01:10:28.688 --> 01:10:31.900
Would Foot give a shit about what I'm wearing?

01:10:40.283 --> 01:10:42.118
Is that Edgar Cayce?

01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:56.591
If anyone enters by me, he will be saved.

01:10:56.716 --> 01:11:01.679
The thief comes only to steal,
to kill, and destroy.

01:11:02.263 --> 01:11:07.060
But I have come that they may have life,
life in all its fullness.

01:11:07.727 --> 01:11:10.063
That the father knows me,

01:11:10.063 --> 01:11:13.358
and I know the Father,
in the same way I know my sheep,

01:11:13.358 --> 01:11:16.778
and they know me, and I am willing to die for them.

01:11:16.819 --> 01:11:18.947
"I have given YOU an example"

01:11:18.988 --> 01:11:22.784
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd
gives his life for his sheep.

01:12:11.332 --> 01:12:14.919
Infinite goodness is creating a being...

01:12:14.961 --> 01:12:19.924
...that you know in advance is going to complain.

01:12:22.927 --> 01:12:26.973
"To be or not to be"

01:12:30.602 --> 01:12:32.270
Thanks, I dug it.

01:12:40.528 --> 01:12:42.822
If you die first and there's life after death,

01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:45.116
...will you give me a sign?

01:12:45.783 --> 01:12:48.620
- I'll try.
- You're terrific.

01:12:52.582 --> 01:12:54.709
Did Cutshaw behave himself?

01:12:54.751 --> 01:12:57.128
As usual. Where are you going?

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:00.548
To the beach. The diner down there serves
great eggs Benedict. You'd like to come?

01:13:01.716 --> 01:13:05.553
- Yeah, it's my favorite food.
- Why don't you come along?

01:13:07.555 --> 01:13:11.518
No, thanks. I feel tired. I think
I'm going to lie down for a while.

01:13:12.101 --> 01:13:13.311
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.857
I was hoping you'd come along and pick up the check.

01:13:17.857 --> 01:13:20.193
- Colonel...
- Goddamit!

01:13:25.573 --> 01:13:27.742
Is there any news from earth?

01:13:27.742 --> 01:13:28.952
I'm sorry.

01:13:30.203 --> 01:13:31.704
Any letters?

01:13:31.746 --> 01:13:35.041
- Your planet has demanded your return.
- Fuck that.

01:13:35.083 --> 01:13:36.709
Any packages?

01:13:36.876 --> 01:13:40.421
When I was on Mars my mother
sent me a cheesecake once a month.

01:13:40.463 --> 01:13:43.383
She used to pack it in popcorn to keep it moist.

01:13:43.383 --> 01:13:46.594
All that shit about canals on Mars is a myth.

01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:49.138
Mars is drier than an armpit in hell.

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:50.473
Yes, I know.

01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:53.518
But not here! Here it's nice.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.231
Well Ok, I'm sealing off my mind.

01:14:17.959 --> 01:14:19.419
Colonel Kane.

01:14:23.673 --> 01:14:26.301
- Yes?
- New inmate, sir.

01:14:26.426 --> 01:14:30.430
He got in about half an hour ago.
I put him in your office.

01:14:31.222 --> 01:14:35.059
I didn't think you'd want him mixing
with the others until you'd -

01:14:35.143 --> 01:14:37.395
well - sort ofexplained things to him.

01:14:38.813 --> 01:14:41.316
He seems pretty straight to me, sir.

01:14:41.399 --> 01:14:43.693
Just combat fatigue, from the look of him.

01:14:44.736 --> 01:14:48.031
-Thanks Krebs, I'll see him in a minute.
-Right, sir.

01:15:14.182 --> 01:15:15.600
Jesus.

01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:19.979
'Killer' Kane!

01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:30.907
Colonel, Colonel. Its me, Gilman!

01:15:32.534 --> 01:15:33.493
Come on, let's go.

01:15:35.245 --> 01:15:36.788
Hey, you got a Charlie.

01:15:37.539 --> 01:15:40.792
- Just a boy.
- Forget about it sir, let's get out of here...

01:15:41.376 --> 01:15:44.045
I cut off his head with a wire...

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:46.339
...and he kept on talking.

01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:48.299
What're you holding?

01:15:48.925 --> 01:15:50.677
What's there in your -

01:15:51.386 --> 01:15:53.638
Jesus!

01:16:07.402 --> 01:16:09.529
Christ, this is obviously mistake, sir.

01:16:10.154 --> 01:16:13.366
Some computer must have goofed up.
It puts you down as...

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:16.703
... incharge of the state asylum...

01:16:17.161 --> 01:16:21.541
...your MOS as 'Psychiatrist'.
Your serial number's wrong...

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.794
There must be another Colonel Kane.

01:16:27.755 --> 01:16:31.467
There must be another Colonel Kane.

01:16:38.933 --> 01:16:40.602
Vincent.

01:17:12.091 --> 01:17:15.386
Tell me again about goodness in the world.

01:17:15.887 --> 01:17:18.306
You lying bloody butchering bastard!

01:17:20.517 --> 01:17:25.188
Don't touch me, don't come near me.
There's your brother up there.

01:17:25.522 --> 01:17:29.317
There's your bloody green-soaked brother
that's Kane. That's 'Killer' Kane!

01:17:29.317 --> 01:17:31.903
He'll cut your fucking head off with a wire!

01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:55.635
I needed you!

01:18:11.359 --> 01:18:14.904
- What happened?
- You fainted, don't you remember?

01:18:21.411 --> 01:18:22.954
What do you remember?

01:18:24.914 --> 01:18:26.207
I don't know.

01:18:28.585 --> 01:18:29.878
Nothing.

01:18:31.504 --> 01:18:33.715
I was walking to my room...

01:18:35.175 --> 01:18:37.343
You remember the new inmate?

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:41.389
New inmate?

01:18:44.559 --> 01:18:46.227
You don't remember.

01:18:46.519 --> 01:18:48.771
What the hell are you talking about?

01:18:57.989 --> 01:19:00.617
Groper, who was that?

01:19:04.204 --> 01:19:05.830
Cutshaw, sir.

01:19:30.313 --> 01:19:32.649
When Kane got the orders, he was...

01:19:32.732 --> 01:19:36.194
... he was commanding a Special
Forces camp just south of DMZ.

01:19:37.529 --> 01:19:40.406
By the time he got to the States,
they'd caught the mistake.

01:19:40.448 --> 01:19:42.909
But by then it was clear he
meant to go through with it.

01:19:43.576 --> 01:19:45.411
We've been watching him.

01:19:46.454 --> 01:19:49.666
We heard the - we heard the stories about his cracking.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:55.171
He seemed to be on the edge of a
very serious breakdown, and then...

01:19:56.381 --> 01:20:00.802
...one computer dropped the stitch
and gave a halfway out:

01:20:01.219 --> 01:20:04.597
A way to find help without facing his illness;

01:20:04.848 --> 01:20:07.350
A way to hide from himself;

01:20:08.142 --> 01:20:09.936
But mostly...

01:20:11.771 --> 01:20:16.359
Mostly a way to wash away all the blood:

01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:21.614
a way to do penance for all
the killing - by curing.

01:20:21.906 --> 01:20:24.576
At first, it was just a pretense but...

01:20:25.785 --> 01:20:29.289
...on the way back from Viet Nam
it developed into something more.

01:20:29.664 --> 01:20:32.834
His hatred of the Kane who killed became denial,

01:20:32.834 --> 01:20:34.586
and also projection:

01:20:34.627 --> 01:20:37.797
'Someone else must have done all the killing'.

01:20:38.214 --> 01:20:41.509
Then after a time the denial became so strong that...

01:20:41.676 --> 01:20:44.929
...it totally obliterated Kane's identity.

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.182
He suppressed the Kane who was the killer,

01:20:47.182 --> 01:20:50.268
and became the better-self that's in all of us.

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.644
Completely.

01:20:52.812 --> 01:20:54.856
Except when he dreamed.

01:21:05.408 --> 01:21:07.368
We were experimenting, you see...

01:21:08.536 --> 01:21:11.456
He was on the inside, looking out.

01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:14.167
An inmate functioning as a psychiatrist...

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:17.295
...and coming to bear on the problem
like nothing we'd ever seen before.

01:21:17.921 --> 01:21:22.342
We hoped he might come up with a new
answer, or atleast some new insight.

01:21:23.301 --> 01:21:24.719
And I think he did.

01:21:25.428 --> 01:21:27.805
I think the men have been responding to him.

01:21:29.474 --> 01:21:36.814
But he suffered a setback today. And a bad one.
...You see, his only hope of finding cure
for himself is ...

01:21:37.065 --> 01:21:40.610
...to wipe away the guilt by a saving act...

01:21:41.736 --> 01:21:43.863
by curing the other inmates,

01:21:44.989 --> 01:21:47.325
or atleast see some improvement.

01:21:49.536 --> 01:21:51.579
But that takes time.

01:21:52.789 --> 01:21:54.082
Time and your help.

01:21:54.624 --> 01:21:58.253
And you've seen my orders. But I
want Kane to play out the string.
You understand?

01:21:58.461 --> 01:22:00.088
- Lieutenant Gilman.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:00.129 --> 01:22:06.469
I'd like you to try to convince the other inmates
that you were mistaken. That shouldn't be too
hard to sell around here? Will you do that?

01:22:07.053 --> 01:22:08.221
Oh yeah, sure.

01:22:11.182 --> 01:22:14.561
Groper, Krebs, Christian and the
others will back you up. So will I.

01:22:17.313 --> 01:22:18.773
Colonel.

01:22:20.066 --> 01:22:22.819
Let me get something straight.

01:22:24.612 --> 01:22:27.991
You've been incharge here, all the time.

01:22:29.075 --> 01:22:30.326
That's right.

01:22:31.286 --> 01:22:34.038
Kane is Vincent Kane.
I'm Hudson.

01:22:35.123 --> 01:22:36.541
I'm the psychiatrist.

01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:39.752
Vincent is my patient.

01:22:45.633 --> 01:22:49.512
When we ah - when we were kids
I used to make him laugh all the time.

01:22:49.888 --> 01:22:51.931
I was the clown, you know.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.437
And I've been trying to help
him remember me. But he won't do it.

01:22:59.856 --> 01:23:01.065
He's my brother.

01:23:45.985 --> 01:23:51.449
Hey waitress, could I have a runway
for the young lady and one more scotch.

01:23:51.491 --> 01:23:54.369
Sir, you've got five right there in front of you.

01:23:56.079 --> 01:23:57.747
I wanted six.

01:23:59.457 --> 01:24:00.500
Quiet.

01:24:01.334 --> 01:24:03.545
That's him. I know that's him.

01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:07.507
- You're demented.
- Up yours! I've seen his picture in the paper.

01:24:09.676 --> 01:24:11.594
You don't read papers, Stanley.

01:24:11.761 --> 01:24:15.723
- You're an illiterate.
- Then TV, you asshole!

01:24:15.807 --> 01:24:17.934
Look at him! Look at his face!

01:24:18.059 --> 01:24:20.645
He's the astronaut,
the one that lost his marbles!

01:24:20.728 --> 01:24:23.398
What's he doin' in a joint like this?

01:24:23.398 --> 01:24:25.567
Now, how the fuck do I know?

01:24:25.817 --> 01:24:29.571
Dude, they have all types of those army
whackos stashed up in that Biltmore dump!

01:24:29.612 --> 01:24:31.906
What if it could be one of them?
I don't know!

01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:36.077
But that's him, I swear.
I'm positive.

01:24:36.286 --> 01:24:39.247
How positive is positive, Stanley?

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.708
You wanna bet?

01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:44.419
Yeah, how much?

01:24:48.047 --> 01:24:52.385
Just a beer and a shot in the mouth.

01:24:55.471 --> 01:24:56.681
Lead on.

01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:59.601
I think he's kinda cute.

01:25:02.353 --> 01:25:06.566
- I told you not to smoke!
- Hey Steve, two beers and two bourbon rocks.

01:25:17.827 --> 01:25:19.329
You desire an audience?

01:25:19.954 --> 01:25:21.789
What's your name?

01:25:24.083 --> 01:25:25.710
Rumpelstiltskin.

01:25:28.546 --> 01:25:31.424
- Wise-ass.
- A literate.

01:25:33.009 --> 01:25:34.219
Your name.

01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:37.555
My maiden name or married?

01:25:38.598 --> 01:25:40.141
Too literate.

01:25:41.434 --> 01:25:43.061
Waitress!

01:25:46.898 --> 01:25:48.566
See? Marines.

01:25:48.942 --> 01:25:51.069
USMC.

01:25:51.819 --> 01:25:54.447
Unbridled Sex for the Masters Clubs.

01:25:58.117 --> 01:25:59.953
Is it something I said?

01:26:00.203 --> 01:26:04.832
If I lose this bet Richard, I'm
going to punch him in the mouth.

01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:08.461
One more scotch and two spittoons, love,

01:26:08.753 --> 01:26:11.589
Fill them with caterpillar's blood.
My friends here are very...

01:26:12.048 --> 01:26:13.258
Hey, cut that out!

01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:29.524
It's him.

01:26:29.899 --> 01:26:31.651
It's really him.

01:26:31.693 --> 01:26:35.029
I got his dog tags Richard, its him!

01:26:35.238 --> 01:26:37.699
The bigshit astronaut.

01:26:38.199 --> 01:26:39.617
My God!

01:26:40.994 --> 01:26:44.914
Hey! Everybody!
Guess what we've got here...

01:26:45.248 --> 01:26:49.335
A damned celebrity!
A chicken, wigged-out astronaut!

01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:03.933
This here is Captain Billy Cutshaw,
brothers and sisters.

01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:09.480
Oh my God.

01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:13.776
Now I propose...

01:27:16.654 --> 01:27:24.037
I propose that we make him an
honorary member of our club.

01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:31.127
Now that's friendly!

01:27:35.548 --> 01:27:37.800
Would you like to join our club?

01:27:38.718 --> 01:27:40.303
Fuck you.

01:27:52.524 --> 01:27:54.943
Okay. Don't fuck you.

01:28:06.454 --> 01:28:10.625
Now this is what I learnt in the boyscouts.

01:28:17.048 --> 01:28:19.175
Hello? Could you help me please?

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:22.220
Do you have a listing for some kind of asylum -

01:28:22.804 --> 01:28:29.936
...could you maybe invite Charlie Price and
Dick Cooey and Jeniffer and -

01:28:31.938 --> 01:28:33.815
I'm sorry...

01:28:34.274 --> 01:28:38.319
Do you have a number for some kind
of asylum for marines or something?

01:28:39.237 --> 01:28:42.740
First, we must baptize the chicken-mother.

01:28:45.118 --> 01:28:49.122
- Richard, you may have the honors.
- Thank you, Stanley.

01:28:50.164 --> 01:28:51.624
Lets have a countdown.

01:28:52.208 --> 01:29:02.218
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1..

01:29:02.677 --> 01:29:04.554
Splash down!

01:29:13.563 --> 01:29:17.942
Everything A-O.K. there, spaceman?

01:29:20.737 --> 01:29:24.991
Could you polish your chains,
they're old and little cruddy

01:29:56.731 --> 01:30:00.151
Welcome...to the club.

01:30:01.236 --> 01:30:02.403
Colonel Kane.

01:30:03.404 --> 01:30:05.031
No, I'm on.

01:30:10.703 --> 01:30:12.580
Where are you located?

01:30:13.581 --> 01:30:22.048
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

01:30:22.841 --> 01:30:25.218
Splash down!

01:30:28.054 --> 01:30:29.347
Again!

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:36.229
10, 9, 8, 7...

01:30:52.161 --> 01:30:53.413
Cutshaw.

01:30:55.331 --> 01:30:58.376
- Been meeting your family.
- I think it's his keeper.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:03.798
I think we got us a new beach ball.

01:31:07.051 --> 01:31:08.052
Come on.

01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:12.599
That's my beach ball, man.
Put it down.

01:31:13.516 --> 01:31:14.893
Yeah, you tell him, Stan.

01:31:14.893 --> 01:31:19.272
- You better call the M.P.s!
- Nah, the S.P.s: that's the Shit Patrol!

01:31:21.399 --> 01:31:23.484
Here's your goodness in man.

01:31:24.611 --> 01:31:25.820
Did you talk?

01:31:27.155 --> 01:31:29.616
I think the beach ball here just said something!

01:31:33.119 --> 01:31:35.163
Did you talk?

01:31:35.455 --> 01:31:36.706
Let go of him, please.

01:31:38.249 --> 01:31:41.503
You, let go of my beach ball.

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:44.464
Please let us go.

01:31:44.714 --> 01:31:46.049
Pretty please.

01:31:48.426 --> 01:31:49.511
Pretty please?

01:31:52.889 --> 01:31:54.140
Now say...

01:31:56.309 --> 01:31:58.520
... "Marines are chicken."

01:32:08.655 --> 01:32:11.533
Come on, say it.

01:32:14.577 --> 01:32:15.370
Marines...

01:32:16.329 --> 01:32:17.080
Let's finish it.

01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:21.125
Marines are chicken.

01:32:23.878 --> 01:32:26.089
Wait wait, just two more.

01:32:34.097 --> 01:32:35.390
Now say...

01:32:35.723 --> 01:32:38.810
"Marines all suck."

01:32:45.358 --> 01:32:46.276
Now come on.

01:32:48.528 --> 01:32:50.864
You're gonna say it and get outta here?

01:32:52.365 --> 01:32:54.868
Go on, now. Say it.

01:32:57.954 --> 01:33:03.376
Say it:"Marines all suck."

01:33:06.129 --> 01:33:07.589
And you can go.

01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:22.353
Marines...

01:33:25.023 --> 01:33:27.734
Come on, let's finish it.

01:33:30.403 --> 01:33:31.863
Marines...

01:33:34.782 --> 01:33:36.492
Marines...

01:33:38.661 --> 01:33:39.871
...all...suck.

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:45.877
Let's play beach ball!

01:33:48.630 --> 01:33:53.426
U.S.M.C.!

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:59.432
U.S.M.C.!

01:34:02.477 --> 01:34:04.103
Ah, it's break time! Isn't that so?

01:34:05.396 --> 01:34:17.033
U.S.M.C.!, U.S.M.C.!

01:34:18.826 --> 01:34:20.245
The marines have landed.

01:34:20.453 --> 01:34:22.956
You want a little drink, lunar boy?

01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:28.002
- Richard, get me a beer-
- Coming up.

01:34:28.753 --> 01:34:30.213
Uh-oh, here comes Stanley.

01:34:52.402 --> 01:34:54.028
Fucking slob.

01:34:55.321 --> 01:34:57.365
Now clean up the mess.

01:35:08.626 --> 01:35:10.420
I'm on vacation!

01:35:20.722 --> 01:35:22.056
Now lick it.

01:35:22.724 --> 01:35:23.850
Lick it!

01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:26.227
Lick it!

01:35:28.813 --> 01:35:30.231
Hey, cut that out!

01:35:33.067 --> 01:35:34.027
Lick it.

01:35:34.903 --> 01:35:36.487
And I'll let you both go.

01:35:37.322 --> 01:35:38.740
You and your friend.

01:35:41.492 --> 01:35:42.702
Now lick it.

01:35:53.755 --> 01:35:55.006
Lick it.

01:36:03.431 --> 01:36:05.141
Jesus Christ.

01:36:05.975 --> 01:36:09.312
Chicken-shit turd.
He did it!

01:36:23.326 --> 01:36:24.494
Scum.

01:36:28.456 --> 01:36:31.751
That's for disgracing the fucking uniform.

01:36:31.751 --> 01:36:33.086
You bastards!

01:36:33.336 --> 01:36:35.630
- Sons of bitches!
- Get him down.

01:36:35.755 --> 01:36:38.216
Get him down on the floor. I got a present for him.

01:36:52.272 --> 01:36:54.232
Hold the bastard steady.

01:37:00.738 --> 01:37:02.115
Hold him down, will ya?

01:37:08.913 --> 01:37:12.166
- How're you doing, Richard?
- That guy's a fighter.

01:37:14.544 --> 01:37:16.671
I think he wants some more...

01:37:31.728 --> 01:37:32.604
Oh my God.

01:37:46.117 --> 01:37:47.493
What the fuck...

01:37:58.087 --> 01:37:58.963
You son of a -

01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:54.461
- Come on, Coronel.
- You said yourself he was provoked.

01:38:54.503 --> 01:38:57.715
- Yeah, but he also...
- No, goddammit! He stays!

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:11.729
We're taking him in, sir.

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.690
Sorry, but we are.

01:39:14.899 --> 01:39:18.652
And you can either produce him,
or we'll find him ourselves.

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:28.662
Come on, Frank.

01:39:32.791 --> 01:39:34.793
Better hold it right there pal.

01:39:47.598 --> 01:39:48.766
Colonel?

01:40:10.579 --> 01:40:12.456
Colonel Kane, Sir.

01:40:21.841 --> 01:40:24.260
Has anybody told Ann?

01:40:27.012 --> 01:40:30.224
- Ann?
- My wife.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.440
No, its alright.

01:40:42.027 --> 01:40:43.904
Where's Gilman?

01:40:46.949 --> 01:40:49.243
He's downstairs, sir.

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:51.453
Is he alright?

01:40:55.124 --> 01:40:58.169
Yes, sir. He's fine sir.

01:41:02.006 --> 01:41:03.340
Cutshaw.

01:41:04.133 --> 01:41:05.676
Yes, sir?

01:41:07.636 --> 01:41:10.556
Why won't you go to the moon?

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:28.282
Because I'm afraid.

01:41:30.075 --> 01:41:31.368
Afraid?

01:41:33.704 --> 01:41:35.623
That's right, sir.

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.338
See the stars...

01:41:43.672 --> 01:41:46.050
So cold...

01:41:46.675 --> 01:41:48.886
So far...

01:41:50.513 --> 01:41:52.932
and so very lonely.

01:41:54.099 --> 01:41:56.519
Oh, so lonely.

01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:59.647
All that space...

01:42:01.565 --> 01:42:04.318
just empty space.

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:09.573
and so...far way from home.

01:42:13.536 --> 01:42:15.788
I've circled round...

01:42:15.955 --> 01:42:18.958
...and round this house.

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:22.211
Orbit...

01:42:22.711 --> 01:42:24.380
...after orbit.

01:42:26.966 --> 01:42:29.176
And sometimes I wonder...

01:42:30.553 --> 01:42:35.474
...what it would be like never to stop.

01:42:37.726 --> 01:42:40.312
and circle alone up there...

01:42:41.856 --> 01:42:43.524
...forever.

01:42:46.068 --> 01:42:48.362
And what if I got there,

01:42:50.489 --> 01:42:52.616
got to the moon,

01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:00.374
and couldn't get back?

01:43:02.459 --> 01:43:05.421
Sure, everyone dies.

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:10.217
but I'm afraid to die alone...

01:43:10.718 --> 01:43:13.095
...so far from home.

01:43:16.098 --> 01:43:18.517
And if there's no God..

01:43:20.436 --> 01:43:22.646
then that's really...

01:43:23.355 --> 01:43:25.441
...really...

01:43:25.691 --> 01:43:27.818
...alone.

01:43:52.051 --> 01:43:54.261
Not...much time.

01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:59.517
Time.

01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:03.437
No time.

01:44:07.650 --> 01:44:09.777
But I'll show you...

01:44:11.529 --> 01:44:16.283
But I'll show you...God exists.

01:44:21.372 --> 01:44:23.582
That's right, sir...

01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:29.880
One example...

01:44:36.345 --> 01:44:38.806
And the others...

01:44:39.974 --> 01:44:42.601
maybe...

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:45.271
help.

01:44:45.896 --> 01:44:48.649
Try to cure...

01:44:49.817 --> 01:44:53.654
Try to cure them too.

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:57.199
I don't know.

01:45:02.371 --> 01:45:04.707
No other way now.

01:45:07.459 --> 01:45:09.503
Time.

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:14.717
No time.

01:45:18.596 --> 01:45:21.640
Had to try...

01:45:23.267 --> 01:45:25.060
Shock...

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:28.480
shock treatment.

01:45:41.327 --> 01:45:43.537
What was that, sir?

01:45:51.879 --> 01:45:53.214
Tired.

01:45:58.260 --> 01:45:59.386
Tired.

01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:09.855
Oh, God.

01:46:11.065 --> 01:46:13.192
I love -

01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:04.220
Oh God.

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:05.763
Oh, my God.

01:48:06.305 --> 01:48:07.473
Ok, Sir.

01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.770
He's on his way.

01:48:14.146 --> 01:48:16.398
Can we talk to the other?

01:48:26.659 --> 01:48:29.703
Hey, what the hell is going on?
Why the cops?

01:48:30.037 --> 01:48:32.164
Alright. Sorry, go back to bed.

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:35.793
Where's Cutshaw?

01:48:36.836 --> 01:48:40.130
Krebs, look in the dorm, will you please?
Christian, go up -

01:48:41.298 --> 01:48:43.050
Oh, my God.

01:49:07.491 --> 01:49:09.034
He's dead.

01:49:14.707 --> 01:49:17.042
He gave up his life.

01:50:02.630 --> 01:50:03.839
Major?

01:50:58.227 --> 01:51:03.107
If you die first and there's life after death...

01:51:03.107 --> 01:51:06.402
Will you give me a sign?

01:53:55.863 --> 01:53:57.781
Captain Cutshaw,

01:53:58.199 --> 01:54:00.367
I'm taking my life...

01:54:00.367 --> 01:54:04.580
...in the hope that my death will provide
the shock that is curative therapy.

01:54:04.622 --> 01:54:08.417
In any case,
you now have your one example.

01:54:09.168 --> 01:54:12.630
If ever I've injured you, I am sorry.

01:54:13.005 --> 01:54:15.716
I have been fond of you.

01:54:15.841 --> 01:54:19.261
I know some day I will see you again.

01:54:19.428 --> 01:54:21.055
Vincent Kane.

01:54:44.703 --> 01:54:47.915
Sure heard some stories about this place, sir.

01:54:48.666 --> 01:54:52.670
Heard they had a doctor there
that was really a killer.

01:55:00.302 --> 01:55:02.680
He was a lamb.

01:55:13.774 --> 01:55:14.733
Ok.

01:55:30.291 --> 01:55:33.002
Hey, hold it, hold it.

01:55:35.296 --> 01:55:38.966
Where did the Saint Christopher medal come from?
