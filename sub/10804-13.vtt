WEBVTT

00:29.155 --> 00:31.115
Master Nobu.

00:32.033 --> 00:35.119
The necessary preparations have been made.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.831
It's ready for use,
should it come to that.

00:37.914 --> 00:41.793
And as per your orders,
we just obtained these.

00:41.876 --> 00:45.964
Twenty targets in total,
all in New York City.

00:46.047 --> 00:49.217
After years of searching...

00:49.300 --> 00:52.804
the fate of Black Sky is in our hands.

00:53.847 --> 00:58.727
Now this Daredevil is the only thing
that stands in our way.

00:58.810 --> 01:01.563
-I suggest you get to work.
-Which one would you like to hit?

01:06.484 --> 01:08.319
All of them.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.531
We need to lay low.

01:12.616 --> 01:14.492
They're gonna come for us.

01:14.576 --> 01:18.872
Bullshit. They'll come for her.
What is this?

01:18.955 --> 01:22.166
I'm sorry, old man, but I just can't
take chances with you anymore.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.669
You're naïve.

01:24.753 --> 01:27.463
She should be tied in this chair,
not me.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.258
She is not the problem.
They are.

01:30.341 --> 01:34.345
They're gonna turn this city upside down
looking for her, Matty.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.514
They'll watch it burn.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.432
That's why I said
we need to work together.

01:38.516 --> 01:40.810
There is no together.

01:40.894 --> 01:43.396
All these years, I tried to tame her.

01:44.355 --> 01:46.816
I should have let her bleed out
in the back of that car.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.068
You should have some damn gratitude.
She spared your life.

01:49.152 --> 01:54.198
The Black Sky cannot be controlled,
manipulated or transported.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.201
It must be extinguished at all costs.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.870
You wanna talk about being naïve?

01:58.953 --> 02:01.706
'Cause right now you're tied to a chair...

02:01.790 --> 02:04.125
spouting rhetoric about an ancient war.

02:05.794 --> 02:07.629
Do you even have a plan?

02:10.298 --> 02:11.549
I'm working on it.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.927
Well, while you're working on it, son,

02:14.010 --> 02:17.430
do me a favor
and pull your head out of your ass.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.349
-The Black Sky--
-The Black Sky is bullshit, Stick.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.060
It's a myth.
No one believes it but you.

02:22.143 --> 02:25.271
Every assassin in the Hand believes it.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.065
What do you think
they're gonna do about it?

02:27.148 --> 02:29.275
What about what I believe, Stick?

02:30.068 --> 02:32.987
What about what I'm gonna do about it?

03:03.601 --> 03:05.394
Leave me alone, Matthew.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.816
Stick's downstairs.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.736
He's restrained.

03:18.992 --> 03:21.077
You know, whatever you're feeling,
it's gonna pass.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.412
What do you know
about what I'm feeling?

03:24.288 --> 03:25.498
Just...

03:26.457 --> 03:30.253
consider the possibility that
there is no such thing as a Black Sky.

03:31.379 --> 03:36.050
That it's... it's mysticism, you know?
It's nonsense.

03:36.134 --> 03:38.887
I've been trained to kill it
since I was a kid.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.139
Yeah, maybe everything
they taught you was a lie.

03:41.890 --> 03:43.641
Stick says I have a gift.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.353
The special kind,
the kind very few people have--

03:47.436 --> 03:49.397
"The kind very few people
have or deserve." I know.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.065
I got the same speech.

03:51.149 --> 03:53.401
Stick likes
his fortune-cookie wisdom, but...

03:53.484 --> 03:57.571
that's all he needed, 'cause he was
training children to fight a war.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.574
You can't deny it.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.161
Some of what the Hand does
defies explanation.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.662
Just because
I don't understand something

04:04.746 --> 04:07.248
doesn't mean I'm ready
to chalk it up as some fairy tale.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.960
True or not...

04:11.044 --> 04:13.880
the legend says
that once they have the Black Sky

04:13.963 --> 04:15.214
they'll be capable of anything.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.676
It's not about what I'm willing to do.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.512
Even in a cage I'll be their false idol.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.389
They'll do terrible things in my name

04:23.472 --> 04:26.100
because they think the Black Sky
will make them invincible.

04:26.184 --> 04:29.854
Well, they can't have you.
You don't belong to anyone.

04:29.938 --> 04:31.355
And you may be smarter and stronger

04:31.439 --> 04:34.650
and more powerful
than anyone they've ever met...

04:35.609 --> 04:39.322
but like I keep saying,
they don't get to tell you who you are.

04:39.405 --> 04:42.491
Their organization
is older than most countries.

04:43.492 --> 04:47.121
They're powerful...
and they're everywhere.

04:47.205 --> 04:49.540
And they survived just like the Chaste...

04:49.623 --> 04:51.459
by staying in the shadows...

04:52.376 --> 04:55.254
by getting people to believe
wholeheartedly in their legend.

04:55.338 --> 04:58.216
But if we shine a light on them,
they'll scatter... all right?

04:58.299 --> 05:01.469
We can take them down.
Not Stick's way. We can do it our way.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.807
You would trust me...

05:07.391 --> 05:09.477
after all I've put you through?

05:13.606 --> 05:16.609
The Hand's ninjas
can mask their heartbeats...

05:18.777 --> 05:21.197
Yours is always loud and clear.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.118
I've been fighting this war my whole life.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.579
I've heard every story.

05:29.831 --> 05:32.666
Some people say
Nobu's lived three lifetimes.

05:32.750 --> 05:36.087
A criminal record that goes back decades.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.133
True or not, he's the head of the snake.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.970
But he's our best chance
of taking down the Hand.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.430
Then our job is simple.
We find Nobu. We extract him.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.600
We remove him from the Hand
without alerting his troops.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.188
Can't be that easy.

05:55.023 --> 05:57.066
Giving up is easy.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.947
You will kill him?

06:03.031 --> 06:04.157
No.

06:06.034 --> 06:07.952
That would make him a martyr.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.454
I wanna dethrone him.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.624
Defrock him and let him rot in a cell.

06:15.293 --> 06:18.212
Show this cult of his
that their holy man...

06:18.296 --> 06:20.089
isn't anything but a guy.

06:23.301 --> 06:25.053
-We'll have to find him first.
-Yeah.

06:25.136 --> 06:27.972
And I say we head
straight into the lion's den.

06:29.515 --> 06:32.310
The last thing they're expecting
is that we hit back at them now.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.731
You would risk everything for me?

06:45.949 --> 06:47.408
So how do we do this?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.579
Not alone.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.169
We do it together.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.115
Our firm represents
Hell's Kitchen's top clients.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.908
Of course, by accepting our offer

08:10.992 --> 08:14.078
you'll get a personal assistant,
a corner office,

08:14.162 --> 08:17.915
and the opportunity to branch out
and build your own client base.

08:17.999 --> 08:22.253
Your former associate, Ms. Marci Stahl,
recommends you very highly.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.881
And after reviewing
the infamous Punisher trial,

08:25.964 --> 08:30.511
I would be foolish not to invite
a talent like yourself onto our team.

08:31.387 --> 08:34.598
Hopefully, you'll find
our starting salary competitive.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.854
That's...

08:41.980 --> 08:43.357
one way to describe it.

08:43.441 --> 08:44.525
It gets better.

08:44.608 --> 08:49.530
How does "Hogarth, Chao,
Benowitz and Nelson" sound?

08:49.613 --> 08:51.157
Like a mouthful.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.034
A good mouthful.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.619
You think outside of the box,

08:55.703 --> 08:59.290
and that is exactly
what we're looking for.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.126
If the past few months are any indication,

09:02.210 --> 09:06.714
my firm is going to need
a very resourceful attorney.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.132
Someone like you...

09:08.216 --> 09:13.304
who's not afraid to take on riskier,
non-traditional cases.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.098
Cases involving vigilantes.

09:15.181 --> 09:17.850
Let's call them
"people with complexities."

09:17.933 --> 09:20.269
You have no idea.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.689
Try me.

09:57.348 --> 10:00.601
Yeah, I don't know about this.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.688
I made all this stuff to keep Betsy safe,
not just give it away.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.941
-You'll get it back, Melvin.
-Without a scratch.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.110
Promise.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.863
If you say so.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.331
Expecting trouble?

10:22.415 --> 10:25.168
-Yeah, a little bit.
-That figures.

10:25.251 --> 10:27.670
Well, it's a good thing you got company.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.298
Ah, before I forget.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.680
These are for you.

10:38.889 --> 10:42.017
- Merry Christmas, huh?

10:43.311 --> 10:45.354
What is it?

10:45.438 --> 10:47.105
Billy club.

10:47.190 --> 10:49.858
Like the cops use, only, like,
a million times cooler.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.945
It's my own design.
Special steel fiber composite cable.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.738
Damn near indestructible.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.407
Check it out.
You can change the length.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.161
Here, play with it.

11:07.210 --> 11:08.836
-Where's mine?
-That's, uh...

11:08.919 --> 11:11.714
-It's a prototype. I only made one.
-Hey. Hey, don't mind her.

11:12.465 --> 11:14.007
So, check it out.

11:14.091 --> 11:17.052
You could use it as a grappling hook,
or, uh...

11:18.178 --> 11:20.389
close quarter combat.

11:20.473 --> 11:22.140
The possibilities are endless.
Here.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.108
Melvin, I... I don't know what to say.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.277
Don't say anything.

11:33.361 --> 11:35.279
I mean,
the papers might not report it, but...

11:35.363 --> 11:38.657
some of us in Hell's Kitchen,
we know who's really looking out for us.

11:38.741 --> 11:39.867
It's yours, man.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.678
How does it feel?

14:04.762 --> 14:07.765
Knowing that the kids you've trained
are going to fight your war for you...

14:07.848 --> 14:09.725
while you're sitting here?

14:09.808 --> 14:11.602
Biggest mistake of your life, child.

14:11.685 --> 14:12.853
Maybe.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.649
But it'll be my mistake,
because this is my life.

14:19.902 --> 14:20.944
All right, let's go.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.613
We'll hit the tunnels
and we'll spread out from--

14:22.696 --> 14:25.783
Foggy. Foggy. Foggy.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.076
Foggy.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.995
Foggy.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.329
-Will you take that?
-Foggy.

14:31.414 --> 14:33.916
-Yeah, I'll just be a sec.
-Foggy.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.959
- Foggy?
- Yeah.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.920
Sorry, man, it's not a good time.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.964
-I was afraid you'd say that.
-Are you at the police station?

14:41.048 --> 14:43.592
Brett says he's in deep shit
and needs legal counsel,

14:43.676 --> 14:45.010
so he was just desperate
enough to call me.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.845
I figured it was my problem
till I got down here,

14:46.929 --> 14:48.972
took a look at his face.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.434
Something went down.
He won't spill it,

14:51.517 --> 14:53.351
but he's been roughed up.
He says it was some gangbangers.

14:53.436 --> 14:55.062
But I've known him long enough
to tell when he's lying.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.523
-Why does he need a lawyer?
-They wanted files, Matt.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.191
Classified police stuff.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.569
All right, this...
It's gonna have to wait. I can't--

15:01.652 --> 15:04.947
Not just any files.
They were asking about you.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.282
And I'm not talking about Matt Murdock.

15:09.452 --> 15:11.829
-Uh, what did they want?
-I have no idea.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.997
But from the looks of him,
they wanted it pretty bad.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.876
He's helped us and Daredevil,
stuck his neck out when he didn't have to.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.503
-And now--
-Yeah, okay. I'm on it.

15:19.587 --> 15:20.879
-I'll be right down.
-Okay.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.549
- You better be.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.501
So...
this is what it's come to, huh?

15:58.584 --> 16:01.629
The masked vigilante
is the only one I can trust.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.547
What happened?

16:03.631 --> 16:07.510
I knew it was just a matter of time
till you showed up... again.

16:08.511 --> 16:11.138
It'd be better if you just told me,
Detective.

16:15.225 --> 16:19.522
Not the first time
some asshole roughs me up.

16:20.606 --> 16:23.108
The job...
This shit ain't easy.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.778
But then they said
they got eyes on my mom.

16:26.779 --> 16:29.698
Said they were gonna kill her.
Even put her on the phone.

16:29.782 --> 16:31.199
Who?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.370
No idea.
Worked for someone big, though.

16:35.453 --> 16:39.708
Had real power behind those fists,
and I'm not talking muscles.

16:39.792 --> 16:43.211
They wanted everything we had on you.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.798
I don't imagine you have much.

16:45.881 --> 16:50.302
Well, it might surprise you to know that
we do keep track of two things real well.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.722
Records of people you put away...

16:53.806 --> 16:56.141
and incident reports.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.476
Records on everyone else.

16:58.561 --> 16:59.770
Everyone else?

17:01.605 --> 17:03.941
That's what they were after.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.694
They wanted to know
everyone you ever saved.

18:18.599 --> 18:19.767
Karen.

19:08.732 --> 19:11.026
Get your damn hands
off me, asshole!

19:17.783 --> 19:18.826
Hey.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.955
Any idea who these people are?

19:23.038 --> 19:24.081
No.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.084
Where'd they grab you?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.002
-Who gives a shit?
-Just tell me.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.090
42nd and 9th.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.802
Wasn't doing nothing.
Taking a goddamn stroll.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.847
Supposed to be on house arrest.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.933
House arrest?

19:44.601 --> 19:45.894
You're being monitored?

19:45.978 --> 19:48.563
-What are you, my PO?
-Look, I'm trying to help here.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.281
Thank God.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.533
That means they know you're here.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.704
Mmm, I might have tampered with it a bit.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.914
-What?
-A boy's gotta get out once in a while,

20:05.998 --> 20:07.916
-you know what I mean?
-Put it on. Turn it back on.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.753
- And get shot by these assholes?
- No more talking.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.297
Do you want to stay alive or what?

20:20.428 --> 20:24.057
-What's your name?
-Karen Page.

20:24.141 --> 20:25.558
What's yours?

20:28.520 --> 20:31.106
- You leave her alone!

20:34.777 --> 20:37.738
I was a POW in Laos.
This is a cakewalk.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.532
--You and me!

20:40.615 --> 20:43.201
One on one.
Huh? Coward!

20:43.285 --> 20:45.829
-Coward!
-Hey! Look, look, look, look, look!

20:45.913 --> 20:47.748
He doesn't know what he's saying,
all right? He's scared.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.047
Not anymore.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.467
The next one to make a sound dies.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.807
Hey.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.413
Come on.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.294
Come on, come on.

21:37.798 --> 21:38.882
Come on.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.594
Come on.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.638
Come on.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.516
The people they took aren't the target.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.229
They're bait.
The Hand's trying to lure me in.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.856
It's me they want.

21:53.939 --> 21:58.568
-You're the only thing in their way.
-Those people are innocent.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.737
You can't just take the bait.

22:00.821 --> 22:02.823
I know, but I can't
just abandon them either.

22:02.906 --> 22:03.907
I know.

22:03.991 --> 22:07.160
We gotta get ahead of this thing
before any of them get hurt.

22:12.249 --> 22:13.791
Slow your breath.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.670
- Focus.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.965
Okay. Focus.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.889
You'll find them.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.766
You'll find her, Matthew.

22:34.229 --> 22:36.231
I can't hear... hear anything!

22:36.314 --> 22:38.566
The electricity in this building
is too loud.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.361
-The city is pulsing like--
-Matthew, it's... it's your city.

22:41.444 --> 22:42.779
Calm it down.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.948
-Okay?
-Okay.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.909
Tune out everything that's not essential.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.213
Now...

23:02.007 --> 23:03.841
...one at a time.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.032
Okay, go!

24:13.203 --> 24:14.954
Shit.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.916
Take care of it.
I'll tell him.

24:32.514 --> 24:35.642
What part of house arrest
do these assholes not understand?

24:39.396 --> 24:41.814
10-13, officer down.
36th and 7th.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.316
They stuck him with a goddamn arrow!

24:45.985 --> 24:50.073
Copy that. 10-13.
Officer down. Backup on the way. Over.

25:19.894 --> 25:23.565
This is it.
There's police below.

25:23.648 --> 25:26.025
Two officers already dead.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.320
Fifteen, twenty hostages inside.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.239
Nobu's men?

25:31.323 --> 25:33.325
Yeah, they can hide their hearts, but...

25:33.408 --> 25:36.453
when there's this many of them,
they're buzzing like a beehive.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.330
-How many?
-I don't know.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.582
Could be an army.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.126
-Can you isolate Nobu?
-No.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.463
We can't move until we're sure he's here.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.256
We have to do something
before these people get hurt.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.799
I'm not here for them.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.260
I came to take down Nobu
and you said you'd help.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.429
I know, and I will, Elektra,
but right now, the people in that--

25:54.512 --> 25:56.306
They were used to draw us out.

25:57.265 --> 26:00.643
I'm sorry, Matthew,
but saving them wouldn't help us.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.729
There are 20 innocent people in there.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.940
If we go in there right now,
Nobu gets what he wants.

26:06.023 --> 26:09.527
You dead, me captured.
The Hand wins.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.280
I know it's harsh,

26:12.364 --> 26:14.657
but the people in there
are a drop in the ocean

26:14.741 --> 26:17.119
compared to what happens next
if Nobu gets hold of me.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.704
These people are in danger because of me.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.375
And I'll be damned
if I'm not getting them out.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.753
-It's the wrong play.
-It's the only play.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.172
You stay here.
I got work to do.

26:31.048 --> 26:35.052
- It's gonna be fine.

26:35.137 --> 26:36.513
- Shit.
- No.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.680
Please, oh, no, please.
It's nothing!

26:37.764 --> 26:39.349
There's nothing there.
You don't have to look.

26:40.392 --> 26:43.395
--It's a family heirloom. It's nothing.

26:43.478 --> 26:46.689
- It's okay. It's fine.
- No. Listen, calm down.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.400
--It's nothing.

26:48.483 --> 26:49.859
- It's nothing.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.069
- There's a button, we can--

26:52.154 --> 26:54.739
--Hold on.

26:54.822 --> 26:56.658
No. No! Get off me!

26:56.741 --> 26:58.326
-It wasn't my idea!
-You don't have to do that! Please!

26:58.410 --> 26:59.952
He'll turn it off!
Oh, my God!

27:21.308 --> 27:22.892
Out the door, take a right!

27:22.975 --> 27:24.186
Go!

27:25.562 --> 27:27.230
- Go, go, go, go! Hurry!

27:28.273 --> 27:29.774
Here.

27:35.322 --> 27:36.573
You're okay?

27:37.990 --> 27:40.243
Better now.
Oh, God.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.998
-Go, go, go.
-No, no, no... wait, wait, wait.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.886
Keep going out the door.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.763
Wait, you okay?

28:00.847 --> 28:01.931
- Can you help her?
- Yeah.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.641
Okay. Come on.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.451
I got bored.

28:43.681 --> 28:46.309
The only way out is up.
Let's head to the roof.

29:09.206 --> 29:13.169
The Black Sky will be ours.

29:29.686 --> 29:30.937
Hold your fire!

29:31.020 --> 29:32.980
--Hold your fire.

29:34.774 --> 29:38.027
Sarge, they have snipers
on all the entrances. We can't go in.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.821
Okay, well, hold your fire.

29:49.038 --> 29:50.540
--Somebody's coming out.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.958
I said hold your fire.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.253
Oh, shit.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.466
Get EMS on scene now!

30:01.384 --> 30:03.428
These people are in shock.
Get 'em out of here and get 'em help.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.472
- Move!
- Brett?

30:05.555 --> 30:07.349
-Page?
-Yeah.

30:12.186 --> 30:15.357
Any shitstorm you're not a part of?
What's going on up there?

30:15.440 --> 30:17.066
These people are being used for bait.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.069
There's some kind of weird cult up there,
and they want Daredevil.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.325
We need those big lights!

30:25.408 --> 30:29.704
Light it up!
Hit 'em up there, there, and there!

30:29.787 --> 30:31.831
If something happens on that roof,
I wanna see it.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.249
Karen!

30:33.333 --> 30:35.710
Foggy?
What are you doing here?

30:35.793 --> 30:38.170
Jesus. Brett said there was
shit going down, but he didn't say this.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.672
-Yeah.
-I'm just glad you're okay.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.800
Thanks.
But I'm not the only one in danger.

30:42.884 --> 30:43.926
What's going on up there?

30:45.219 --> 30:47.722
I think it might be the end
of vigilantes in New York.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.349
Holy shit.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.987
I'm not gonna lie to you.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.947
There's a lot more coming.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.411
One thing's for sure.

31:09.494 --> 31:11.120
We're gonna die.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.928
Do you wanna end it here...
or on the roof?

31:29.764 --> 31:32.224
I've always liked the fresh air.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.374
What's up there?

31:57.459 --> 31:59.376
--Oh, Jesus.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.090
Too many to count.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.676
Armed, packing katanas,
couple of longbows.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.764
More coming up from below.
Same weapons.

32:14.684 --> 32:17.394
I'd say we've got a couple of minutes
before they break through that door.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.147
Okay.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.364
Even if we survive...

32:29.323 --> 32:30.992
we may not see each other again.

32:34.871 --> 32:36.372
Okay, let's do it.

32:36.456 --> 32:39.208
Wait, wait. Wait for one second.
One second.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.961
--So, what if...

32:46.674 --> 32:48.217
What if...

32:49.301 --> 32:52.054
from now on, if... if we make it...

32:54.306 --> 32:55.892
wherever you run, I...

32:56.976 --> 32:58.352
I run with you?

33:01.022 --> 33:02.439
You're not serious.

33:02.524 --> 33:04.275
I've never been more serious.

33:06.653 --> 33:10.990
This...
Elektra, this is a part of me that I need.

33:11.908 --> 33:14.494
And you're the only one who gets it.

33:14.577 --> 33:17.789
Without this, I'm not alive.
I'm not. Not really.

33:18.915 --> 33:20.958
And I know that now, thanks to you.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.046
I don't know what we are together,

33:25.129 --> 33:27.674
and if we have any chance in the future...

33:27.757 --> 33:29.801
I don't...

33:31.553 --> 33:33.971
But I... I do know that I'm free with you.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.766
Like with no one else.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.269
You hide from yourself.

33:42.772 --> 33:44.649
You don't let anyone in.

33:44.732 --> 33:45.817
You.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.529
I let you in.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.533
Think about it.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.619
What if this isn't the end?

33:57.954 --> 33:59.706
What if it's just the beginning?

34:00.623 --> 34:01.958
No.

34:04.961 --> 34:06.921
--They'll find us.

34:07.004 --> 34:08.505
No, we'll keep moving.

34:09.215 --> 34:13.553
We'll change identities. We'll...
we'll hide. They'll never catch us.

34:13.636 --> 34:16.013
--What do you say?

34:18.641 --> 34:20.977
Uh, I say...

34:21.060 --> 34:23.395
let's go to London.

34:23.479 --> 34:26.608
Yeah? Madrid.
Tunisia.

34:26.691 --> 34:28.735
There are sexy places to hide.

34:29.694 --> 34:32.780
Hey, I've never been further north
than 116th Street, so...

34:33.865 --> 34:35.700
Because you love New York.

34:35.783 --> 34:38.285
And I'd give my life for it, but...

34:40.079 --> 34:43.249
there's one thing in this world
that makes me feel more alive.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.376
And that's you.

34:47.378 --> 34:50.590
I'm the Black Sky, Matthew.

34:50.673 --> 34:53.134
Yeah, and I'm the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

34:56.846 --> 34:59.641
- The airport's just a cab fare away.

34:59.724 --> 35:03.728
All we gotta do is survive whatever's
waiting for us behind that door.

35:04.646 --> 35:06.480
Let's get out of here.

35:24.624 --> 35:26.458
Remember
they're trying to kill me, not you.

35:26.542 --> 35:27.919
Over my dead body.

35:48.314 --> 35:49.732
No one...

35:52.068 --> 35:54.028
escapes destiny.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.496
You belong to us.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.333
- And you...
- belong in the ground.

37:34.628 --> 37:36.839
You're done, Nobu.

37:36.923 --> 37:38.424
Your army will crumble.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.010
And you will leave my city alone.

37:41.093 --> 37:44.471
Your city belongs to no one.

37:45.431 --> 37:46.473
And she...

37:47.183 --> 37:48.392
belongs to us!

38:45.532 --> 38:46.783
No.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.582
No, Elektra.

38:58.921 --> 39:00.756
They have nothing now.

39:02.299 --> 39:04.010
I took it all away.

39:08.848 --> 39:11.683
It's okay. It's okay.
Try not to talk.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.731
I know... I know now...

39:19.984 --> 39:21.652
what it feels...

39:23.570 --> 39:25.031
to be good.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.785
--Just relax.

39:29.869 --> 39:31.620
Try not to... try not to talk.

39:35.207 --> 39:38.419
Does it always hurt that much?

39:45.134 --> 39:46.343
Yeah.

39:47.344 --> 39:50.639
Yeah, it, uh...
it always hurts that much.

39:55.144 --> 39:56.979
This is not the end.

40:47.113 --> 40:48.155
Finish him.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.045
Get down. Get down.

41:03.129 --> 41:04.505
Don't move!
Everybody get down!

41:39.748 --> 41:41.042
Frank.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.763
See you around, Red.

43:10.005 --> 43:13.049
And this time, you piece of shit...

43:20.015 --> 43:21.475
...stay down.

43:58.011 --> 44:00.264
I wanted to say a few words, but...

44:02.641 --> 44:03.934
I don't have any.

44:06.687 --> 44:08.480
God rest her soul.

44:10.106 --> 44:11.817
That should be enough.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.573
You know, once in college,
I brought her roses.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.577
She hates roses.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.293
You wanted her dead.

44:36.550 --> 44:38.510
Was it worth it?

44:41.347 --> 44:42.681
What?

44:44.391 --> 44:45.559
Loving her.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.776
You taught me
to cut all my ties to humanity...

44:55.902 --> 44:57.488
to other people.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.033
I had only a few moments with her...

45:03.910 --> 45:08.332
amidst all the...
noise, chaos, and the violence.

45:12.043 --> 45:14.880
We were together only for moments.
That was all.

45:21.470 --> 45:22.763
Orchids.

45:24.097 --> 45:25.349
She likes orchids.

45:27.726 --> 45:31.104
And, yeah, Stick... it was worth it.

45:35.233 --> 45:40.196
Matt, you are the toughest
son of a bitch I have ever met.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.617
Let's go home.

46:44.052 --> 46:45.512
Are you gonna be okay?

46:45.596 --> 46:50.183
I came to New York thinking there's no way
I could feel lonely in a city of millions.

46:51.852 --> 46:53.395
But you do.

46:53.479 --> 46:55.731
Somehow it makes it all worse.

46:58.108 --> 47:00.402
I used to love coming here...

47:00.486 --> 47:02.320
with you and Matt.

47:03.864 --> 47:05.657
Josie's actually felt like home.

47:06.617 --> 47:10.829
A home with... very sticky floors
and belligerent drunks, nightly.

47:10.912 --> 47:12.330
Right.

47:13.457 --> 47:15.166
And now, no Matt.

47:17.127 --> 47:18.587
No us.

47:19.505 --> 47:21.507
No Nelson, Murdock, Page.

47:26.219 --> 47:28.472
We may not be
working together anymore...

47:29.390 --> 47:30.932
but you're not alone, Karen.

47:31.850 --> 47:33.018
I'm still your friend...

47:33.935 --> 47:35.103
if you'll let me be.

47:37.814 --> 47:40.108
Yeah, you're not getting out
that easy, Nelson.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.735
You are stuck with me.

47:41.818 --> 47:43.987
Wouldn't have it any other way.

47:45.989 --> 47:47.365
You're gonna be all right.

47:48.283 --> 47:49.951
More than all right.

47:50.035 --> 47:52.287
- You're gonna come out on top.
- Thanks.

47:52.370 --> 47:53.914
How about you?

47:53.997 --> 47:57.375
Big job, hotshot,
corner office lawyer man.

47:57.459 --> 47:59.795
--It could be exciting.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.963
-Yeah, you could be rich.
-Yeah, rich enough to stop drinking

48:02.047 --> 48:04.425
- the rotgut swill they serve here.

48:08.136 --> 48:09.179
Hey, Josie.

48:10.931 --> 48:13.266
About that long-running
Nelson-Murdock tab...

48:13.349 --> 48:14.976
- Yeah, yeah, I'll add it on.
- No.

48:15.060 --> 48:18.146
We're, uh... we're gonna settle up.

48:19.773 --> 48:21.608
Close us out, Josie.
We're done here.

48:47.801 --> 48:50.303
Karen Page, what the hell
are you still doing here?

48:50.386 --> 48:51.763
It's Christmas Eve.

48:51.847 --> 48:55.851
Shouldn't you be home celebrating
with all that family that you...

48:55.934 --> 48:57.978
can't stand, like everybody else?

48:58.061 --> 48:59.896
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I must be projecting.

49:01.064 --> 49:02.273
I, uh...

49:03.191 --> 49:05.486
can't seem to stop
staring at a blank screen.

49:05.569 --> 49:07.153
-Writer's block.
-Mmm.

49:07.237 --> 49:08.655
There's a cure.

49:10.198 --> 49:12.450
-Scotch.
-That helps you write?

49:12.534 --> 49:14.202
Wow! No.

49:15.120 --> 49:18.414
No, it just...
helps me not care so much.

49:18.499 --> 49:21.042
Yeah, well,
that's definitely my problem.

49:22.293 --> 49:25.547
I care, probably too much,
about all of it.

49:26.507 --> 49:29.635
I don't even know
if I should start with...

49:29.718 --> 49:32.804
the hostage crisis, or Frank,
or vigilante justice--

49:32.888 --> 49:34.723
That's just... that's just garbage.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.602
-Well, it's news.
-No, it's not.

49:38.685 --> 49:42.105
Not anymore. I mean, all the facts
about that have been reported already.

49:43.064 --> 49:44.399
--Look.

49:44.482 --> 49:49.487
If you... if you really wanna
torture yourself this holiday,

49:49.571 --> 49:51.072
go ahead, be my guest.

49:51.156 --> 49:54.284
But at least write something new.

49:54.367 --> 49:56.244
Something different.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.205
-Something that only you can write.
-Right. Which...

50:00.165 --> 50:01.625
which would be what?

50:01.708 --> 50:02.959
The truth.

50:04.294 --> 50:06.171
Your truth, Karen.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.216
All of it.
Everything that you've been through.

50:10.300 --> 50:12.260
Don't pull any punches.

50:12.343 --> 50:16.932
This is New York.
People think that they've seen everything.

50:18.809 --> 50:22.813
Prove 'em wrong.
Tell them something they don't know.

50:24.439 --> 50:27.483
Hell,
I'd read the shit out of that.

50:38.119 --> 50:39.329
Happy Hanukkah.

50:40.997 --> 50:44.751
-Scotch.
-Mmm, you know, just... just in case.

50:46.252 --> 50:50.090
I'll expect 2,000 words in my inbox
before Santa shows up.

50:51.549 --> 50:53.134
You got it, boss.

51:09.067 --> 51:10.193
Okay.

51:27.543 --> 51:30.130
"What is it, to be a hero?

51:31.632 --> 51:33.884
Look in the mirror and you'll know."

51:47.856 --> 51:51.943
"Look into your own eyes
and tell me you are not heroic,

51:52.027 --> 51:55.238
that you have not endured, or suffered...

51:56.156 --> 51:58.950
or lost the things you care about most.

52:00.827 --> 52:02.913
And yet, here you are...

52:04.622 --> 52:06.624
a survivor of Hell's Kitchen...

52:07.625 --> 52:09.920
the hottest place anyone's ever known.

52:11.046 --> 52:12.881
A place where cowards don't last long.

52:12.964 --> 52:15.425
So... you must be a hero.

52:18.553 --> 52:19.846
We all are.

52:20.430 --> 52:23.183
Some more than others,
but none of us alone.

52:24.309 --> 52:27.478
Some bloody their fists
trying to keep the Kitchen safe.

52:32.067 --> 52:35.111
Others bloody the streets
in the hope they can stop the tide,

52:35.195 --> 52:37.155
the crime, the cruelty...

52:38.114 --> 52:41.159
the disregard for human life
all around them.

52:42.703 --> 52:44.370
But this is Hell's Kitchen.

52:46.707 --> 52:51.502
Angel or devil, rich or poor,
young or old, you live here.

52:52.462 --> 52:55.799
You didn't choose this town.
It chose you.

53:00.428 --> 53:04.557
Because a hero isn't someone
who lives above us, keeping us safe.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.268
A hero is not a god or an idea.

53:08.394 --> 53:10.105
A hero lives here...

53:11.022 --> 53:13.984
on the street, among us, with us.

53:15.568 --> 53:17.988
Always here but rarely recognized.

53:19.865 --> 53:24.160
Look in the mirror
and see yourself for what you truly are.

53:39.050 --> 53:40.468
You're a New Yorker.

53:45.807 --> 53:47.100
You're a hero.

53:48.434 --> 53:50.561
This is your Hell's Kitchen.

53:52.230 --> 53:53.689
Welcome home."

54:15.420 --> 54:17.088
Thanks for meeting me.

54:27.765 --> 54:29.517
What am I doing here, Matt?

54:31.186 --> 54:34.147
I, uh...
I have something.

54:34.230 --> 54:36.817
- No, I don't want it.
- I have something...

54:39.777 --> 54:41.071
that I need you to see.

55:03.759 --> 55:05.261
I'm Daredevil.
