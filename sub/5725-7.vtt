WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.505
WOMAN:
How's work, honey? Things
getting better at the office?

00:04.538 --> 00:07.241
YOUNG WOMAN (on screen):
Mom, I don't want to talk
about that. I have news.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.443
I think Ethan's
going to propose.
No.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.711
Really?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.146
I know. About time, right?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.614
About time for what?

00:13.647 --> 00:15.416
For our daughter
to get engaged.

00:15.449 --> 00:18.252
What? I don't believe it.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.388
Hey, Ethan better beg
for my permission first.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.655
Gil!
Dad!

00:21.689 --> 00:23.591
So, what makes you
think it's gonna happen?

00:23.624 --> 00:25.659
Did he, uh... did he
ask for your ring size?

00:25.693 --> 00:28.529
No. Just your
credit card number.
(Gil laughs)

00:28.562 --> 00:30.631
Very funny, kiddo. Nice.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.166
You know, if I'm right, it means

00:32.200 --> 00:33.734
I can quit my job
out here in Tampa

00:33.767 --> 00:35.269
and move back home to New York.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.604
I really miss you...

00:36.637 --> 00:38.772
Isabel?
(man yelling on screen,
Isabel screaming)

00:38.806 --> 00:40.608
Oh, my God, Gil,
what is happening?!
(screaming continues)

00:40.641 --> 00:43.244
Isabel?! Isabel?!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:43.277 --> 00:45.613
No! Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

00:45.646 --> 00:47.615
No! No! Izzy!
No!

00:47.648 --> 00:50.751
No! (sobbing)
Is... No! No!
Izzy! Izzy!

00:50.784 --> 00:53.721
(sobbing)
GIL: Stop!

00:56.890 --> 00:59.693
(distant boat horn blows)

00:59.727 --> 01:02.062
(distant phone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

01:03.364 --> 01:05.833
RYAN:
This is all I could find.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.340
It's your turn, Tristan.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.874
Just take your time.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.110
Try to describe
exactly what you saw.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.550
(sighs)

01:22.583 --> 01:24.885
He... he-he killed Isabel.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.820
He? You saw his face?

01:26.854 --> 01:29.823
No. I, uh...

01:29.857 --> 01:32.260
I don't know.
I don't think so.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.727
But you know it was a male?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.729
No, I...

01:35.763 --> 01:37.731
I guess not. I...

01:37.765 --> 01:39.733
I don't know why I said that.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.502
Is it bright in here to you?

01:45.906 --> 01:47.575
That better?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.677
Yes. Thanks.
Okay.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.180
Let's go back again,
to the beginning.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.415
Tell me what
you do remember.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.251
Let's start with where you were
when it happened.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.920
(sighs)

01:59.953 --> 02:02.356
I was, um,

02:02.390 --> 02:05.859
in my apartment,
sitting at my desk.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.663
I live across the courtyard.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.899
And, um...

02:11.932 --> 02:13.934
(sighs)

02:13.967 --> 02:15.636
I'm sorry.
I don't know why...

02:15.669 --> 02:17.305
I can't remember.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.507
I am trying.
It's just a blur.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.509
Okay, it's a blur.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.544
Hey, just take your time.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.615
There is one-one thing.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.150
She was smiling.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.822
Police officers said
they found you in the courtyard.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.824
Sir? Sir, are you okay?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.726
(whimpering, gasping)

02:38.759 --> 02:41.329
I need ESU
at 1298 Horizon Court.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.232
I saw him. He killed Isabel.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.734
MALE (over radio):
Uh, 271. Roger that.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.736
Do you remember saying that

02:48.769 --> 02:50.771
to the police officer?

02:54.642 --> 02:55.809
(engine revving)

02:55.843 --> 02:57.678
(siren wails in distance,
indistinct radio communication)

02:57.711 --> 02:59.580
I need to get
in there!
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.982
Processed only evidence that
couldn't wait for your arrival,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.352
and left all electronic devices
for your team.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.787
Heard police
found a ski mask.
In a puddle.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.957
Any trace of DNA would've been
compromised by the muddy water.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.660
And we don't often tag team
with Cyber so quickly.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.428
You guys usually come later.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.330
So, what's so special
about this murder?

03:16.364 --> 03:19.233
Tampa PD called us in to recover
artifacts from a video-chat.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.602
Our best shot of identifying
our killer might exist

03:21.635 --> 03:22.970
on the victim's computer.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.738
Whole thing was
captured on WeDial.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.842
(camera shutter clicking)

03:28.876 --> 03:30.844
RUSSELL: Lacerations on
her face and neck.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.946
Defensive wounds
on her arms.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.449
Several stab wounds
to her chest and her back.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.851
Bled out within minutes.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.854
First responders said that
they found her posed like this,

03:40.888 --> 03:43.924
with her hands on her thighs,
palms up, and they said

03:43.957 --> 03:45.759
that her face was covered.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.696
That indicates the killer
felt remorse.
RUSSELL: Right.

03:48.729 --> 03:53.301
Also suggests
that our victim knew her killer.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.335
There's your computer.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.606
Her name's Isabel.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.940
Her parents are on a flight
here right now.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.041
RAMIREZ:
Oh, I can't imagine

04:01.074 --> 04:03.944
witnessing your own daughter's
murder on a video-chat.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.679
Or at all, for that matter.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.348
No. I can't, either.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.550
Okay, so, evidently,
the killer

04:09.583 --> 04:11.285
slammed the laptop
down by the lid

04:11.319 --> 04:13.587
after he was finished
with Isabel.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.857
Any chance
that he left any fingerprints?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.330
MUNDO: Unfortunately,
it doesn't look like it.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.531
All these swirl patterns
look the same.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.998
Which means they
belong to our victim.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.000
Okay.
Yeah, all right.

04:27.034 --> 04:27.968
It's all yours, Raven.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.537
Want me to open it for you?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.672
No! Don't kid about that.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.073
Why can't you open it?
RAMIREZ:
I need

04:33.106 --> 04:35.008
to recover a hibernation file.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.209
MUNDO: Whenever you
close a computer

04:36.243 --> 04:38.746
without shutting it down,
it goes into hibernation mode.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.747
All the programs
and applications

04:39.780 --> 04:40.948
that were running on it

04:40.981 --> 04:42.950
are then written to the hard
drive in a hibernation file.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.685
And it'll take longer to access

04:44.718 --> 04:47.054
Isabel's video chat
if we were to open it.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.756
RUSSELL:
All right, get to it.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.692
That file could lead us
to the identity of our killer.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.861
I'm downloading the file.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.364
Nelson and Krumitz should
have it any minute now.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.503
NELSON:
Ooh! Isabel Stanworth's computer

05:02.536 --> 05:04.037
is infested with malware.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.839
I mean, it's gonna take a while
to untangle all of this.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.775
(phone buzzing)
Not to mention
someone had remote access

05:07.808 --> 05:09.377
to our victim's
laptop camera.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.815
Krumitz, you see that?

05:14.848 --> 05:15.816
What?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.451
What are you doing?

05:17.485 --> 05:18.952
Stopping the download.
I saw something.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.020
What?!

05:20.053 --> 05:21.455
That.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.127
They-they... they wouldn't even
let us go in the apartment.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.630
We haven't even
had a chance

05:29.663 --> 05:31.031
to see her!
No, sir.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.032
I-I, I know.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.867
(sighs)

05:33.901 --> 05:36.103
As soon as we're finished
here, a police officer's gonna

05:36.136 --> 05:38.772
escort you to the medical
examiner's office.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.041
Thank you, but
we have a ride.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.512
Uh, Isabel's boss,
Neil, is a family friend.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.580
She moved to Tampa
to work for his company.

05:46.614 --> 05:49.149
Do you know who did
this to my daughter?

05:49.182 --> 05:52.853
No, sir, we don't, but we're
gonna do everything in our power

05:52.886 --> 05:54.121
to find out.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.589
There's another witness?
Yes.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.691
A Tristan Jenkins.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.059
Neighbor or friend?

05:59.092 --> 06:00.027
Oh.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.495
You know him?

06:01.529 --> 06:03.597
No.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.567
Just nice to know she had
a friend out... outside of work.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.536
Isabel just moved here.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.003
I-I understand

06:10.037 --> 06:12.172
this is very difficult, but

06:12.205 --> 06:16.043
sir, I-I need both of you
to tell me everything you saw.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.011
Okay.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.080
Okay, um...

06:20.113 --> 06:22.650
We were just...

06:22.683 --> 06:25.185
We were just
talking to Isabel.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.455
GIL: Did he ask
for your ring size?

06:27.488 --> 06:29.122
No. Just your
credit card number.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.692
(laughs) Very funny,
kiddo-- nice.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.727
She was very happy.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.764
She was...

06:38.999 --> 06:42.970
(crying)

06:43.003 --> 06:45.773
I'm so sorry.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.142
GEORGIA: Uh, at first,

06:49.176 --> 06:50.911
I didn't know what I was seeing.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.112
Isabel?
I really miss you guys.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.180
(screaming)

06:53.213 --> 06:54.982
But then I realized

06:55.015 --> 06:57.117
that her screams were real,

06:57.150 --> 06:59.853
and that it was Isabel's blood
that splattered on the screen.

06:59.887 --> 07:00.854
GEORGIA:
Isabel!

07:00.888 --> 07:02.623
Isabel!
(grunting)
Stop it! No!

07:02.656 --> 07:04.492
Stop it!
No, no! Izzy!
No!

07:04.525 --> 07:07.027
Izzy!
(crying):
No!

07:07.060 --> 07:08.696
Stop!

07:14.568 --> 07:18.138
I, uh... I saw a figure,

07:18.171 --> 07:20.040
and he had a
knife in his hand.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.542
(Isabel's screams echoing)

07:21.575 --> 07:23.777
He stabbed her
several times.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.780
I was going to stop it,
but he was wearing a mask.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.850
Officers on the scene
found that ski mask

07:29.883 --> 07:31.151
in the courtyard
of the building.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.721
Isabel's killer
removed the mask.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.856
Do you remember his face?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.659
I think he turned away.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.694
Close your eyes...

07:40.728 --> 07:43.096
just for a second.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.032
He was running down the stairs.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.167
You were in the courtyard.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.970
He was just ahead of you.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.272
He pulled off his mask.
Now just focus on his face.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.340
Look at his chin.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.043
I want you to tell me
color of his...

07:56.076 --> 07:57.177
No!

07:57.210 --> 07:59.179
(panting)

07:59.212 --> 08:01.549
I told you I don't re...
I don't remember.

08:01.582 --> 08:04.051
I'm sorry. I wish I could
be more helpful than this.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.586
I'm just wasting your time.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.087
All right,
we'll take a break.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.756
(sighs heavily)

08:08.789 --> 08:11.258
Tristan, you are
our only eyewitness.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.071
So, how's it
going in there?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.673
I'm not sure.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.975
Tristan Jenkins
definitely saw something.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.109
He seems to be suffering

08:29.142 --> 08:31.144
from post traumatic
stress disorder

08:31.178 --> 08:33.313
and repressed memories.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.916
A result of witnessing
Isabel's murder.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.119
He claims he can't recall
details of the crime.

08:39.152 --> 08:43.156
I'm not sure
he even remembers calling 911.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.925
Do you think
he might be lying to you?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.226
He's very fragile.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.195
I'm not sure that it's all
related to this crime.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.797
But there's nothing
in his behavior

08:49.830 --> 08:51.999
or demeanor

08:52.032 --> 08:54.835
that indicate to me
the he's fabricating his story.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.136
But?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.940
But there's

08:59.973 --> 09:03.076
definitely something else
he is not telling us.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.681
(Isabel screaming)

09:10.951 --> 09:17.090
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

09:18.992 --> 09:25.165
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

09:25.198 --> 09:28.702
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:28.736 --> 09:32.740
* I can see for miles
and miles *

09:32.773 --> 09:36.810
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:36.844 --> 09:40.380
* And miles...

09:40.413 --> 09:41.615
* Oh, yeah.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.000
I'm sorry. Explain again.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.369
Why am I doing this?
I need you to overcome

10:02.402 --> 10:04.037
your situation-specific amnesia

10:04.071 --> 10:06.740
in order to remember
the killer's face.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.309
But these are all men
in Isabel's life.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.410
The way her body

10:10.443 --> 10:13.681
was posed at the scene suggested

10:13.714 --> 10:15.315
that the killer was someone
she knew.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.349
So, look at each
of these photos

10:16.383 --> 10:18.018
and tell me who these men are.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.690
(sighs)

10:22.723 --> 10:25.225
Ethan's her boyfriend.
They laughed a lot.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.426
Neil's her boss.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.762
He was like an older brother.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.665
If anyone loves finance
more than Isabel, it's Neil.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.034
He helped her adjust to Tampa.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.437
Please, I-I don't want
to do this anymore.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.806
She's your friend.

10:38.839 --> 10:42.910
We need your help
to find Isabel's killer.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.311
Tristan.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.379
(sighs)

10:46.413 --> 10:48.982
Zach's her cousin.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.851
He was thrilled that
she moved closer to him,

10:50.884 --> 10:52.319
but they didn't see
each other much.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.388
Larry's the building super.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.390
He fixes things for everybody.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.429
I don't recognize any of
these people as the killer!

11:02.462 --> 11:04.331
Please, I don't feel very well.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.999
Okay, Tristan, hey...

11:06.033 --> 11:08.001
breathe, breathe.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.870
We just have to get
to what you saw.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.239
Then all of this
will be over.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.213
KRUMITZ:
I think I'm close, Nelson.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.083
Just might have found the
device that put malware
on Isabel's laptop.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.218
(phone buzzing)
(sighs)

11:27.921 --> 11:29.256
(exhales)

11:29.289 --> 11:32.059
You gonna answer that?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.728
Nope. Unknown callers,
blocked numbers,

11:34.762 --> 11:36.263
anyone who
doesn't leave a message,

11:36.296 --> 11:39.032
I do not pick up
and I do not call back.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.001
Yeah, but that
person's persistent--

11:41.034 --> 11:42.369
they really want
to talk to you.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.536
That's the fourth call
this morning.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.906
How do you even know those
four calls are the same person?

11:45.939 --> 11:48.976
I can tell by the buzz.
Get out of here. (laughs)

11:50.043 --> 11:51.879
Can you?
Yeah.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.214
Same person, I'm telling you.
I have the ear.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.984
And I have
the answer.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.985
Look at this.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.220
Got a serial number
from one of the devices

12:00.253 --> 12:02.155
that put malware on
Isabel's computer.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.458
Man, I am really pumping on
all cylinders today. (laughs)

12:05.492 --> 12:08.295
Whoo! High five. Mm.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.930
(phone buzzing)

12:09.963 --> 12:11.765
Wow.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.936
RAVEN: I'm searching
the last device now.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.140
(tapping keys)

12:21.108 --> 12:22.943
RAMIREZ: Hey, guys.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.812
The serial number you found
doesn't match

12:24.845 --> 12:26.980
any of the devices
in Isabel's apartment.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.448
Something's put malware
on her computer.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.283
Maybe someone slipped in
a thumb drive

12:30.317 --> 12:32.886
while she was working
in a public place.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.888
I checked the USB log--
that same device

12:34.922 --> 12:36.456
has been plugged
into Isabel's computer

12:36.489 --> 12:38.291
several times
over the past four months.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.927
It's got to be
a device she owns.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.494
(beeping)
Okay, okay...

12:41.528 --> 12:42.930
Whoa, wait a minute.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.264
Krummy, check this out.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.867
I think I identified
what we're looking for.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.301
No.
Oh, yeah.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.436
Guys?
Oh, yeah.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.438
(chuckling)

12:51.471 --> 12:54.041
Guys, hello? What is it?
Um...

12:54.074 --> 12:56.576
Raven, uh, I think
the device you're looking for

12:56.609 --> 12:58.111
is probably in the bedroom.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.980
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, yo,
you should look

13:00.013 --> 13:02.015
in her nightstand drawer,
all the way in the back.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.085
Just look all the way
in the back. (laughs)

13:05.118 --> 13:06.820
(electronic buzzing)
RAVEN: It's a sex toy.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.189
MUNDO:
It's a sex toy in a Faraday bag.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.925
That thing is connected
to the Internet?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.560
You are looking at the device

13:13.593 --> 13:16.096
that loaded malware
on Isabel's laptop.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.498
Gives new meaning to the word
"sexually transmitted."

13:20.067 --> 13:21.401
Look, it's thirsty.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.535
(laughter)
Stop it!

13:25.305 --> 13:27.908
(woman moaning)
FEMALE NARRATOR: There's
no greater pleasure on earth

13:27.941 --> 13:30.077
than that of two people
becoming one.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.179
But what if the Earth
literally comes between you

13:32.212 --> 13:33.446
and your significant other?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.983
Introducing Teledildonics.
(couple moaning)

13:36.016 --> 13:38.485
Technology that allows couples
in long-distance relationships

13:38.518 --> 13:41.922
to share all the sensations
of sex in real time,

13:41.955 --> 13:44.557
no matter how many miles
separate them.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.326
(Ryan laughs)

13:46.359 --> 13:48.962
Okay, so what he
does in Dublin

13:48.996 --> 13:51.598
she feels in
Duluth, I guess.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.266
Talk about the
Internet of things.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.003
I got a buddy who swears
this saved his marriage

13:56.036 --> 13:57.104
while he was deployed.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.606
A "buddy," huh?
All right,

13:59.639 --> 14:03.877
so Isabel and her boyfriend
Ethan used this toy

14:03.911 --> 14:05.378
to continue
their sexual relationship

14:05.412 --> 14:08.548
after she moved to Tampa
for work.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.151
The sensations of sex
sent over the Internet.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.986
We've come so far.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.054
I'm sure Nelson can hook you up

14:14.087 --> 14:16.323
with someone who would be happy
to give it a try.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.891
I beg your pardon?

14:17.925 --> 14:19.226
MUNDO:
All right,

14:19.259 --> 14:20.994
NYPD just officially dismissed
Isabel's boyfriend,

14:21.028 --> 14:22.462
Ethan Parker, as a suspect.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.165
Looks like security
footage confirmed his
story-- he was in a diner

14:25.198 --> 14:27.167
on the upper West Side
at the time of the murder.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.501
RAMIREZ: Guys,
check this out.

14:28.535 --> 14:32.005
These Wi-Fi toys log
a ton of information
during "partner plays,"

14:32.039 --> 14:34.141
including the number
of devices linked.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.175
Yeah, but there's three.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.910
Ménage à trois?

14:36.944 --> 14:39.012
Every time Isabel and her
boyfriend did the deed,

14:39.046 --> 14:42.015
this third device
came online.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.084
Location unknown.
Wait, so you're saying...

14:44.117 --> 14:46.119
somebody hijacked
Isabel's wireless sex signal

14:46.153 --> 14:48.021
and was... what, watching?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.356
RAMIREZ:
Well, not exactly.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.158
The third device
is another toy,

14:51.191 --> 14:53.626
receiving all of the
outgoing data from Isabel,

14:53.660 --> 14:56.696
and sent its own data
back to her toy...

14:56.729 --> 14:59.399
allowing him remote
participation.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.533
This is cyber rape...

15:00.567 --> 15:02.102
that escalated.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.937
At first,

15:03.971 --> 15:07.440
this digital three-way aroused
our third party,

15:07.474 --> 15:10.410
but eventually,
his appetite for contact

15:10.443 --> 15:13.013
would have increased until
only real-world contact

15:13.046 --> 15:14.347
would have satisfied him.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.283
Isabel's rapist
might also be her killer.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.585
RUSSELL: Hey, guys?
Trace that third device.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.054
RUSSELL: Change of
subject here, but...

15:21.088 --> 15:22.655
the blood in our
killer's mouth...

15:22.689 --> 15:24.057
MUNDO: It's arterial spray
from our victim.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.325
You could tell
by the directionality

15:25.358 --> 15:26.359
of the blood on his mask.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.061
Right, right, but nobody likes

15:28.095 --> 15:29.596
that much blood in their mouth.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.698
No, you're right--
he would have spit it out.

15:31.731 --> 15:35.135
So somewhere at our crime scene,
our killer left his DNA.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.605
Raven, looks like
you're on loogie duty.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.208
*

15:55.022 --> 15:57.024
There it is.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.392
*

16:03.763 --> 16:05.165
KRUMITZ:
Guy at the store said

16:05.198 --> 16:07.567
our victim's sex toy of choice

16:07.600 --> 16:10.270
is dishwasher-safe,
it syncs with any
music library,

16:10.303 --> 16:13.040
and has a "solo
session" mode.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.542
Krummy, you know, man,

16:15.575 --> 16:17.310
what is all of this stuff?
Oh, I...

16:17.344 --> 16:19.779
well, I felt awkward carrying
the thing up to the counter,

16:19.812 --> 16:21.414
so I bought
some decoy items.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.549
Camouflage.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.751
Buying a sex toy was awkward...

16:24.784 --> 16:26.753
but the lingerie
was totally natural?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.121
Well, now...
(awkward chuckle)

16:28.155 --> 16:30.257
(computer beeps)
Uh... the sex toy

16:30.290 --> 16:32.292
I bought also has malware on it.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.393
NELSON: What?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.662
I'm gonna send everything I got
over to that laptop.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.665
Bring up the malware analysis
Raven did on Isabel's toy.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.467
Okay, now,
this is weird.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.770
The malware on the toy
you bought is identical

16:43.803 --> 16:45.638
to the malware on Isabel's.
Isabel bought hers

16:45.672 --> 16:47.474
in Tampa,
and I bought mine in DC.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.142
Mm-hmm.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.477
Supply-chain injection.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.712
Black hats are always trying
to figure out new ways

16:52.745 --> 16:55.282
to get their malware
into the wild.
Okay, so what you're saying

16:55.315 --> 16:57.150
is that our target
compromised these devices
where they were built.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.218
Yep.
Okay.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.787
Isabel's toy was infected
before she opened the box.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.290
(phone ringing)
I'm gonna send the warehouse
address to Elijah.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.426
Go for Krummy.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.795
Nelson, you got a
visitor downstairs.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.338
Well, look at you.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.673
Baby bro at the FBI.
(chuckles)

17:20.707 --> 17:23.110
Why are you
here, Jordan?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.645
All right, straight to it.
Uh, been trying

17:25.678 --> 17:26.813
to call you all morning.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.416
I thought you might pick up
if you didn't know it was me.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.584
Yeah, well, life's
full of disappointment.

17:32.619 --> 17:37.090
Look, I know
things aren't great

17:37.124 --> 17:39.159
between us...

17:39.192 --> 17:40.193
but we are family.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.595
And I'm here because
I need a favor.
Oh, okay,

17:42.629 --> 17:44.731
so I guess we're only family
when you need a favor.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.466
Look, Brody,
this is important.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.201
Okay? I think the FBI's

17:48.235 --> 17:50.437
investigating
one of my firm's clients.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.804
Money laundering.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.306
Okay, you want me
to do what, exactly?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.641
I just need to know
if it's true.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.744
So I can get out ahead of it.
Is that all you need?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.812
I ain't seen you in two years,

17:59.846 --> 18:02.315
and you just waltz in here
like we're close.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.517
Do you remember the
last time we spoke?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.719
The day of my arrest,
when I made bail,

18:06.753 --> 18:09.122
and I caught that cab
down to your office?

18:09.156 --> 18:12.592
And I begged you to represent
me in court, I begged you.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.427
Do you remember
what you told me?

18:14.461 --> 18:17.430
Yes, I...
"Can't help you, Brody.
You're on your own."

18:17.464 --> 18:20.367
And then you pointed
to the door, man.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.870
(sighs)

18:23.903 --> 18:26.539
Brody...

18:26.573 --> 18:28.375
I'm sorry.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.177
Okay?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.912
Yes, I made a mistake.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.714
But I need you now.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.515
Hm.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.816
This could be bad.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.719
Brody, I am
your brother, okay?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.821
I need your help on this one.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.163
(sighs)
I can't help you, Jordan.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.200
You're on your own.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.849
RYAN:
I really appreciate your help.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.319
It means a lot to me
and Isabel's family.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.953
Georgia and Gil are here?
Yes, they are.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.522
You can imagine
how upset they are.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.291
But let's talk
about your best friend.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.528
Tell me about Isabel.

19:22.895 --> 19:26.433
We, uh... we had
a lot in common.

19:26.466 --> 19:30.570
We liked the same Chinese
food, takeout Tuesday...

19:30.603 --> 19:31.771
(chuckles)

19:31.804 --> 19:33.340
Neither of us
had much family

19:33.373 --> 19:35.542
in town, so weekends
were movie marathons.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.644
Usually animated movies.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.580
Sounds like you two
were very close.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.416
She loved painting.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.951
She introduced me to it.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.620
You mentioned your family.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.289
Mm-hmm.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.591
My mom and dad
are still married.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.994
My sister goes to Florida,
a junior. Uh,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.397
my brother
just had a baby.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.500
Grandma died a few years
ago, but Grandpa just...

20:00.533 --> 20:02.302
won't give up the house.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.004
He loved her so much.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.407
He can't even
replace the glasses

20:07.440 --> 20:08.808
Grandma bought him,
no matter

20:08.841 --> 20:10.743
how many times they break.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.714
He just uses masking tape
to hold them together.
(laughs)

20:15.715 --> 20:17.917
Gil and Georgia.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.786
Isabel's parents.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.020
Mm.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.290
You refer to them
by their first name.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.259
But they don't know you.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.998
Of course they don't.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.634
Why would Isabel talk
about me when...

20:34.667 --> 20:37.937
she's in a long-distance
relationship with Ethan?

20:37.970 --> 20:39.972
With all the time that
we spent together,

20:40.006 --> 20:42.642
I mean, what would they think?

20:45.011 --> 20:47.647
Just spoke to Elijah.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.382
He arrested the perv
that intruded

20:49.416 --> 20:50.950
into Isabel's sex device.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.653
Thanks for running.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.323
Guy's guilty of a whole lot
of hacking, not murder.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.025
But there is a silver lining.
Elijah sent us

20:59.058 --> 21:00.026
the sex toy source code.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.127
NELSON: Oh, snap!

21:01.160 --> 21:03.396
That allows us to eliminate
the sex toy intrusion.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.597
Exactly.
I just sent it to you.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.865
Okay, cool.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.734
Wait, Krummy,
you seeing this?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.569
That says someone else
hacked into Isabel's

21:09.602 --> 21:10.670
video-chat program WeDial.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.904
Yeah, but not on
Isabel's computer.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.974
This black hat managed to hack
the whole WeDial network itself.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.443
KRUMITZ:
Are you kidding me?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.010
Our target
can intrude on anyone's

21:18.044 --> 21:20.313
video chat around the world.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.583
Nelson, we just uncovered
the most massive

21:23.616 --> 21:24.617
digital invasion
of privacy ever.

21:36.929 --> 21:40.633
So our black hat didn't
target Isabel specifically,

21:40.667 --> 21:41.734
at least not at first.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.537
He hacked the entire
WeDial network.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.539
He bundled his malware

21:46.573 --> 21:49.442
with a video chat
software update.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.612
So any user who installed the
update was instantly violated

21:52.645 --> 21:54.714
by the target and knew
absolutely nothing about it.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.083
Any time they started
a video chat,

21:57.116 --> 21:59.419
their conversations
were redirected

21:59.452 --> 22:00.887
through the target's computer,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.490
allowing him to eavesdrop.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.992
All right, this is voyeurism.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.694
I mean, not in
a classic sense.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.729
But our target
is a cyber voyeur

22:09.762 --> 22:11.097
who became
obsessed with Isabel

22:11.130 --> 22:12.865
after watching
her on a computer

22:12.899 --> 22:14.734
and realized he couldn't
have a relationship with Isabel

22:14.767 --> 22:17.036
in the real world,
and ultimately killed her.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.939
Right, but if he didn't...
if he didn't actually know her,

22:19.972 --> 22:22.409
then why'd he pose her body?

22:23.910 --> 22:26.112
Well, because,
after so many hours

22:26.145 --> 22:27.680
of spying on her
video chats,

22:27.714 --> 22:30.116
our target felt
like he knew her.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.485
And it doesn't seem like
a coincidence that she was

22:32.519 --> 22:35.855
exploited by two completely
unconnected hackers--

22:35.888 --> 22:37.757
sex toy sicko

22:37.790 --> 22:39.459
and our-our WeDial voyeur?

22:39.492 --> 22:40.660
No.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.762
Isabel was a
high-risk victim.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.432
Think about it. Here's this
attractive young woman,

22:45.465 --> 22:47.900
living in a new town,
missing her family back home.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.736
Her virtual sex play
was an attempt

22:49.769 --> 22:51.471
to fill an emotional void

22:51.504 --> 22:54.407
that was created by
geographic separation.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.075
Internet-enabled intimacy.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.077
Well, this very specific type

22:58.110 --> 23:00.547
of online risk-taking

23:00.580 --> 23:02.515
attracts a very specific type

23:02.549 --> 23:05.151
of deviant sexual predator.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.523
Think I know how to find
our killer's computer.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.592
Good. Because I can't find
any of his digital dust

23:12.625 --> 23:13.893
in the WeDial network.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.862
Well, that's the beauty of this.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.130
We don't need to find it.
We're gonna be led right there.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.568
I infected this laptop
with the WeDial malware, so...

23:21.601 --> 23:23.002
all we need to do
is start a video chat

23:23.035 --> 23:25.505
and our conversation
will be immediately intercepted

23:25.538 --> 23:27.039
by the target's machine.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.541
We'll get his IP address.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.876
Mad props, Krummy.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.678
Well, I have my moments.

23:31.711 --> 23:34.947
Okay. I'm starting a video chat
between you and Raven.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.116
All right.
Say hi and then mute your side.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.085
We can't have the target
listening in.
All right.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.454
Raven knows she's
got to do all the yakking.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.560
KRUMITZ:
All right, we're in.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.663
Our target's computer
is now watching our live chat.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.064
Hey, Raven, how you doing?

23:52.098 --> 23:55.602
KRUMITZ:
Okay, our target's computer
is intercepting our video feed.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.737
Got him. He's in Chicago.

23:57.770 --> 23:58.805
Wait, wait, wait.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.240
IP's in Singapore...

24:01.273 --> 24:03.976
Now it's in the
Ukraine... Malaysia...

24:04.010 --> 24:05.011
They're decoys.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.546
He's rolling his IP address.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.682
We're never gonna
find our target this way.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.594
(phone buzzing)

24:50.690 --> 24:52.158
(phone buzzing)

24:57.830 --> 24:59.031
(Krumitz groans)

24:59.065 --> 25:00.967
I can see our target's
computer online.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.969
But because of the rolling IP,
it means

25:03.002 --> 25:04.971
I can never find
the physical address.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.040
Yeah, but somewhere in the world
that computer does exist.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.976
Solid chance it's
hooked up to Wi-Fi.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.944
Nelson, why do I feel like
you're about to be brilliant?

25:11.978 --> 25:13.746
Only because I am.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.115
Yesterday, we infected ourselves
with the target's malware,

25:16.148 --> 25:18.551
which means our video chats
pass through his computer.

25:18.585 --> 25:21.788
We can communicate with
the computer we can't find.
So even though

25:21.821 --> 25:23.255
I can't locate his computer,

25:23.289 --> 25:25.024
we can still send his computer
an executable.
Uh-huh.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.694
A Wi-Fi sniffing program
hidden in a video chat.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.729
Hey, Krumitz, you there?
KRUMITZ:
It'll sniff out and locate

25:29.762 --> 25:32.298
all the other Wi-Fi signals
in the area that aren't hidden.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.300
We'll identify enough
nearby Wi-Fi networks,

25:34.333 --> 25:35.768
cross-reference their locations

25:35.802 --> 25:37.637
and finally find
the unfindable computer.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.238
Nelson, I could
kiss you right now.
No, no.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.908
Come on.
No. Keep your lips to
yourself, Casanova, okay?

25:41.941 --> 25:43.643
Matter of fact, I'll
ping the target computer

25:43.676 --> 25:44.677
and meet you back at CTOC.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.746
(grunts)

25:46.779 --> 25:48.681
All right, listen up, minions.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.083
Every time we detect a Wi-Fi
network with a recognizable name

25:51.117 --> 25:53.920
that our target computer
has connected with,

25:53.953 --> 25:55.888
I'll call it out.
You flag

25:55.922 --> 25:57.924
the physical location
and that should get us to our

25:57.957 --> 25:59.025
target's computer.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.259
WOMAN: Okay, got it.
MAN: All right.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.794
All right,
we got Dora's Coffee Shop

26:01.828 --> 26:02.729
and Tamale Zone.

26:02.762 --> 26:03.963
Locate all areas where these

26:03.996 --> 26:05.765
two establishments
are near each other.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.900
Sammy's Dry Cleaners

26:07.934 --> 26:10.236
and Irving Grille, okay?
Narrow it down, people.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.771
This should be
getting us closer.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.105
How many Wi-Fi
networks we got?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.641
Uh, four.
No, wait-- five.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.943
MAN: Fort Lauderdale...

26:16.976 --> 26:18.210
NELSON: Got another one.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.311
Not a business.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.213
This one's called Izzy's Crib.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.916
Wait, what?
Izzy's Crib is the name

26:23.950 --> 26:25.852
of Isabel Stanworth's
home network.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.687
"Izzy" as in Isabel,
but-but that would mean

26:27.720 --> 26:29.722
the target and Isabel
are neighbors.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.793
Krummy, they are.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.628
The MAC addresses match.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.963
Our target
uses the same

26:36.996 --> 26:39.799
Internet provider
as Isabel.
Okay,

26:39.832 --> 26:40.800
I'll use
the Wi-Fi networks'

26:40.833 --> 26:41.801
signal strength to triangulate

26:41.834 --> 26:43.169
the exact location

26:43.202 --> 26:44.937
of the target's computer
in Isabel's neighborhood.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.646
Our target is Tristan Jenkins.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.685
Tristan.

26:58.718 --> 27:02.121
I want to play you something.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.190
TRISTAN:
You have to help her.
Please, please!

27:04.223 --> 27:05.858
(phone buzzes)

27:05.892 --> 27:08.427
Someone has to help her.
He's stabbing her!

27:08.460 --> 27:10.830
He's k... he's killing her!

27:10.863 --> 27:12.732
Please, help! Please!

27:12.765 --> 27:14.266
Turn it off, now!

27:14.300 --> 27:15.902
We are gonna push through this.
Right now.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.838
He was attacking her.
You rushed to help.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.006
He was exiting the apartment,

27:20.039 --> 27:21.874
he pulled the mask off.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.009
Who was he?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.744
Who killed Isabel?

27:24.777 --> 27:26.713
(phone line ringing)
Damn it, Avery, pick up.

27:26.746 --> 27:27.947
I can't get D.B.
on his cell.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.982
(phone buzzing)

27:32.151 --> 27:33.920
I shouldn't
have come here.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.022
I shouldn't have come here.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.356
I'm no help at all.
This was a mistake.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.424
This was a mistake!

27:45.832 --> 27:47.834
I need to use the restroom.

27:50.202 --> 27:52.471
(line ringing)
Come on, Raven, pick up.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.240
(phone buzzing)

27:54.273 --> 27:55.808
Krumitz, why do you
keep blowing up...

27:55.842 --> 27:58.410
Raven, Raven,
stop talking, just listen.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.414
Avery, Tristan Jenkins
is the target.
What?

28:02.448 --> 28:04.316
He was behind
the WeDial intrusion.

28:13.392 --> 28:16.929
He wouldn't say who was under
the mask because it was him.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.031
Come on.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.066
FBI!

28:21.801 --> 28:22.802
Clear.

28:22.835 --> 28:23.836
FBI!

28:26.839 --> 28:28.908
Clear!
Clear!

28:28.941 --> 28:31.010
This is
Special Agent Avery Ryan.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.144
We have a suspect fleeing.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.346
Tristan Jenkins, five-foot-ten,
Caucasian, brown hair.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.381
I need him detained.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.092
FBI!

28:46.125 --> 28:47.894
Tristan Jenkins, FBI!
Go right!

28:47.927 --> 28:49.395
Tristan Jenkins!

28:49.428 --> 28:50.797
All clear!

28:50.830 --> 28:51.597
Federal agents!

28:51.630 --> 28:52.899
(indistinct radio
communications)

28:52.932 --> 28:54.366
It's all clear.

29:04.543 --> 29:07.413
(indistinct radio chatter)

29:07.446 --> 29:09.515
Isabel's apartment.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.924
Everything
Tristan told me

29:17.957 --> 29:19.325
about his friendship
with Isabel

29:19.358 --> 29:23.129
he learned by eavesdropping
on her WeDial video chat.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.297
The painting,
the Chinese dinner...

29:25.331 --> 29:26.332
all that happened

29:26.365 --> 29:27.633
while she was video chatting
with someone else.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.036
ISABEL:
Maybe I'll fly home and visit
over the long weekend.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.804
It would be nice to spend
a night in my old room.

29:31.838 --> 29:34.106
TRISTAN:
We liked the same Chinese food.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.142
Takeout Tuesday.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.077
So weekends were
movie marathons--

29:38.110 --> 29:39.011
usually animated movies.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.447
...skip the games
and ask her out already.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.082
Can't get the color
of the ocean right.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.150
You'll look at the ocean...

29:44.183 --> 29:45.217
TRISTAN:
She loved painting.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.953
She introduced me to it.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.255
...painting and you realize
it's actually a million...

29:49.288 --> 29:54.193
This is like a Cyber version
of that movie Rear Window.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.862
But, so,
they never actually met?

29:55.895 --> 29:58.430
The way he's profiling, no,
not in the real world.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.332
Tristan's PTSD masked

30:00.366 --> 30:02.168
more serious behavior:

30:02.201 --> 30:06.605
Technology Facilitative
Social Isolation.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.340
He basically

30:08.374 --> 30:10.176
lived his whole life
in this apartment.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.278
That explains all the eggs we
found in the refrigerator.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.280
Probably wasn't getting enough
Vitamin D from the sun.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.547
Sounds like agoraphobia.

30:15.581 --> 30:18.918
No. Agoraphobia is
an anxiety disorder--

30:18.951 --> 30:20.953
a fear of being
in a situation

30:20.987 --> 30:22.421
where you feel helpless
or trapped.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.224
Tristan's isolation
was not born of fear,

30:25.257 --> 30:27.359
but of dependence.

30:27.393 --> 30:30.429
Technology provided him
with everything that he needed.

30:30.462 --> 30:34.867
He became addicted to
experiencing the world online

30:34.901 --> 30:39.205
and over time, the only time
he felt safe or comfortable

30:39.238 --> 30:41.974
was behind a computer screen.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.944
I bet the first time
he saw Isabel

30:44.977 --> 30:46.845
was when she moved into
this apartment building.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.615
He used his WeDial exploit
to find her

30:49.648 --> 30:51.083
and then
eavesdrop on her.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.218
What drove him to murder?

30:52.251 --> 30:53.319
Primal urge.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.620
As his obsession grew,

30:54.653 --> 30:57.256
he overcame
his self-imposed isolation.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.091
So he forced himself
out his door,

30:59.125 --> 31:00.492
into her apartment,

31:00.526 --> 31:02.895
carved her up while she
video-chatted with her parents.

31:02.929 --> 31:03.930
It's looking that way.

31:03.963 --> 31:07.399
And if so,
Tristan didn't collapse

31:07.433 --> 31:08.935
because he witnessed a murder.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.671
He was overwhelmed
by sensory overload

31:12.704 --> 31:14.673
when he committed murder
and left this apartment.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.642
(phone chimes)

31:18.044 --> 31:20.679
All right,
text from Russell.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.982
"Our killer's saliva is not

31:23.015 --> 31:24.583
in any law enforcement
database."

31:24.616 --> 31:25.952
Well, that
makes sense.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.453
If he hasn't left
this place in years,

31:27.486 --> 31:29.188
he hasn't had the opportunity
to commit a previous crime.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.190
Can you grab

31:31.223 --> 31:33.059
one of Tristan Jenkins'
toothbrushes

31:33.092 --> 31:34.927
and get it to D.B. Russell
in the field office?

31:34.961 --> 31:36.428
Look, a simple DNA test

31:36.462 --> 31:38.364
should tell us
if Tristan's our killer.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.366
Yeah, but with
ten monitors?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.935
I mean, he's probably
watching more than just Isabel.

31:42.969 --> 31:47.173
We gotta find this guy quickly
and put some cuffs on him.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.574
KRUMITZ:
Just heard from Raven.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.509
She's downloading
Tristan's computer.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.379
Hey, man...

31:53.412 --> 31:55.114
You cool?
Yeah.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.616
You didn't eat the trout
in the commissary, did you?

31:57.649 --> 31:59.218
No.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.288
Um... let me ask you
a question.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.490
If you were given
opportunity

32:04.523 --> 32:07.026
to help Francine before
she got in trouble,

32:07.059 --> 32:08.194
would you have?

32:08.227 --> 32:10.529
I'd have done
anything to help her.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.999
Anything.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.034
Yeah.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.104
All right.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.176
RAMIREZ:
Avery?

32:24.210 --> 32:25.744
I think I got something here.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.480
Okay, I've been going
through Tristan's computer.

32:28.514 --> 32:31.683
I found online orders, message
board posts, nothing special,

32:31.717 --> 32:33.752
but then I found this.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.989
Are we live?
No. These are
recordings.

32:37.023 --> 32:39.625
Eight terabytes worth,
over 100 hours of video.

32:39.658 --> 32:40.826
I'm thinking Tristan

32:40.859 --> 32:43.996
captured every WeDial session
that came through his machine.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.697
Wait a second.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.767
There's laughter,
a birthday, a grandfather.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.369
These are all
happy moments.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.338
So, Tristan's doing what?

32:52.371 --> 32:55.341
Collecting happy moments
from his victims' lives?

32:59.145 --> 33:01.747
TRISTAN: My mom and dad are
still married.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.383
My sister goes to Florida.
She's a junior.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.785
Oh, my brother just had a baby.

33:06.818 --> 33:10.589
Grandma died a few years ago,
but he loved her so much.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.159
He can't even replace
the glasses Grandma bought him,

33:13.192 --> 33:15.561
no matter
how many times they break.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.596
There's a generational mix.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.165
These people aren't his victims.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.799
They're his family.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.069
That's why I didn't read
that Tristan was lying.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.537
Tristan so fully
believes his delusion

33:25.571 --> 33:27.439
that he thinks
he's telling the truth.

33:27.473 --> 33:28.740
RAMIREZ: Tristan thinks
this collection

33:28.774 --> 33:31.710
of random strangers
are his loved ones?

33:31.743 --> 33:33.212
To him,
they aren't random strangers.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.181
They are his family.
(phone buzzes)

33:36.782 --> 33:37.749
Russell.

33:37.783 --> 33:38.950
Okay, Avery,

33:38.984 --> 33:42.088
I just got the DNA results back
from Tristan's toothbrush.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.789
It's not a match
to the saliva samples

33:43.822 --> 33:45.557
we got from the crime scene.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.459
He's not Isabel's killer.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.728
All right, so Tristan did not
brave the outside world

33:49.761 --> 33:51.363
to kill Isabel.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.299
But he knew that she
was being murdered,

33:53.332 --> 33:55.467
because he was eavesdropping
on her WeDial session.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.370
He saw exactly what
her parents saw.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.705
ISABEL:
My job out here...
RYAN: He did everything

33:59.738 --> 34:01.807
he could to get her help
without leaving his apartment.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.409
(dialing phone)
MAN: 911. Please state
your emergency.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.444
He's stabbing her!
Please, help! Help!

34:05.477 --> 34:06.712
And then when he realized
the police were not gonna

34:06.745 --> 34:08.714
get there in time, he did
the only thing he could.

34:08.747 --> 34:12.718
He overcame his fears
and stepped outside to help.

34:12.751 --> 34:17.123
But if Tristan's innocent, then,
you know, why'd he run?

34:18.890 --> 34:21.727
RYAN: You know,
the last time we spoke,

34:21.760 --> 34:24.730
I think he might have
recalled the killer's face.

34:24.763 --> 34:25.764
And now he's out for revenge.

34:42.314 --> 34:43.149
I've made up my mind.

34:43.182 --> 34:46.485
He won't stop,
so I have to stop him.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.587
I tried to excuse it,
telling myself

34:48.620 --> 34:51.190
he was just
overly affectionate,

34:51.223 --> 34:53.192
but it's sexual assault.

34:53.225 --> 34:57.696
I threatened to tell my father,
but he wouldn't stop.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.132
So I told him
I'm going to the police.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.534
RAMIREZ: I found this
video journal entry
on Isabel's computer.

35:02.568 --> 35:06.672
She deleted it, and
it took some time to recover.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.275
There are no other videos
like this.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.543
She doesn't identify
who she's talking about,

35:11.577 --> 35:13.412
or where the assault
took place.

35:13.445 --> 35:17.216
Why would she record it
and then delete it?

35:17.249 --> 35:19.218
Shame.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.487
Changed her mind.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.623
But Isabel had already
threatened to go to the police.

35:24.656 --> 35:27.726
This was motive.

35:27.759 --> 35:31.730
The "he" that she talks about...
was scared.

35:31.763 --> 35:35.167
Whoever this person is,
is her killer.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.770
(murderer grunting,
Isabel screaming)

35:40.839 --> 35:42.674
(grunting
and screaming continue)

35:45.744 --> 35:48.780
Recovered this from
Tristan Jenkins' hard drive.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.349
I had to dig through

35:50.382 --> 35:51.783
hours of footage.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.286
This is what Isabel's mother
and father witnessed.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.954
KRUMITZ:
Unfortunately, this video

35:55.987 --> 35:57.789
doesn't actually
help us I.D. our killer.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.660
Okay, all right, uh,
Nelson, go back a few seconds,

36:01.693 --> 36:02.661
please.

36:02.694 --> 36:03.662
(video rewinding)

36:03.695 --> 36:06.265
I really miss you guys.
RUSSELL: Right there.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.766
Isolate that bracelet
and highlight the engraving.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.668
It's the infinity symbol.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.203
What are you thinking?

36:11.237 --> 36:12.671
I'm thinking that we can run

36:12.704 --> 36:15.441
a facial recognition
without a face.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.843
You guys know about ABBI?
Stands for Automated

36:17.876 --> 36:20.746
Body and Belongings
Identification, right?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.848
So we all have articles
of clothing we wear

36:22.881 --> 36:24.816
so often, they become
unique identifiers,

36:24.850 --> 36:26.918
like our murderer's bracelet.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.854
Well, this is great,
but there's no

36:28.887 --> 36:31.690
random-stuff-we-own
database to search.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.659
You know, actually there is,

36:33.692 --> 36:35.794
and that index
happens to be public

36:35.827 --> 36:38.297
and linked directly
to people's names.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.732
What is it?

36:40.766 --> 36:44.303
350 million samples
submitted every single day

36:44.336 --> 36:45.704
by the users themselves.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.773
FriendAgenda!
Pow!

36:47.806 --> 36:50.242
Okay, crop out the unique
characteristics of our killer.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.410
All right,
then we write a script

36:51.443 --> 36:52.578
to crawl
all FriendAgenda photos.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.745
And if Isabel's murderer

36:53.779 --> 36:55.447
is like the rest
of the world, he will

36:55.481 --> 36:59.785
have posted at least one photo
that will lead us to him.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.020
52 matches in the Tampa area.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.590
How many of them are friends
with Isabel Stanworth?

37:05.991 --> 37:07.959
Zilch.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.561
NELSON:
Zero?

37:09.595 --> 37:11.363
The entire time I've worked
here, I've never had

37:11.397 --> 37:12.964
a zero match.
Okay, okay,
okay, well...

37:12.998 --> 37:14.366
(phone buzzing)
Wait a minute.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.434
RUSSELL: Here we go.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.469
All right, so,

37:17.503 --> 37:20.639
social media sites like
FriendAgenda-- they-they link

37:20.672 --> 37:23.775
profiles of relatives
like a family tree, right?

37:23.809 --> 37:26.845
KRUMITZ: Uh, yes, yeah.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.847
Stay-stay with me.
Yeah, yeah.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.550
Okay, when I analyzed
the saliva samples

37:31.583 --> 37:32.884
that Raven collected
from the scene,

37:32.918 --> 37:35.053
the DNA gave me, what?

37:35.086 --> 37:38.390
Age, hair color, eye color,
all of that stuff, but it also

37:38.424 --> 37:42.027
gave me evidence of an
inheritable genetic disease.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.495
Where is it? Right here.

37:43.529 --> 37:46.632
Okay, so, our killer
has a 50% chance

37:46.665 --> 37:49.000
of inheriting
Marfan Syndrome.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.703
Okay, well, let's see
if any of our 52 results

37:51.737 --> 37:54.373
have a parent that belongs to a
support group on FriendAgenda.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.441
Right.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.443
KRUMITZ:
Got two hits.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.877
Bringing up
the profile now.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.383
The one on the right's
our murderer.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.918
Okay.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.088
What now?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.391
You could have given me
the heads up, man.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.592
What are you talking about?

38:13.625 --> 38:14.926
Talking about the FBI.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.695
They're raiding my firm
right now.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.930
They won't even let us back
in the building.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.633
You knew that
this was gonna happen, Brody,

38:21.667 --> 38:23.535
and you did nothing about it.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.803
But I guess blood and family
doesn't mean much

38:24.836 --> 38:25.971
of anything to you now?!

38:26.004 --> 38:28.073
Look, that is not true, Jordan.

38:28.106 --> 38:31.810
We're blood, but it wasn't me
that decided we weren't family.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.479
(phone beeps off)

38:42.854 --> 38:44.055
(siren blaring)

38:44.089 --> 38:45.791
GEORGIA:
You're sure this is everything?

38:45.824 --> 38:46.792
I think so.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.361
But if I find anything
else Isabel had here,

38:49.395 --> 38:50.996
I'll mail it to you.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.831
She was my friend.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.566
Get out!

38:54.600 --> 38:56.668
GEORGIA:
Oh, my God!

38:56.702 --> 38:59.037
Ple-Please...
please don't hurt us.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.007
Gil, Georgia,
I didn't know you'd be here.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.610
Do... do we know you?

39:04.643 --> 39:07.779
No, no, no, I'm not...
I'm not gonna hurt you.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.648
I'm just here for him.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.450
He killed her.
What? What are you
talking about?

39:11.483 --> 39:13.985
I remember.
I finally remember it.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.722
I saw your face when
you took off the ski mask!

39:16.755 --> 39:19.024
Neil, what the hell's
he talking about?
I don't know.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.927
She was my friend,
and you took her from me.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.629
You killed my Isabel.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.730
No.

39:24.763 --> 39:25.897
Is this true, Neil?

39:26.932 --> 39:28.900
GIL: Look at me.
GEORGIA: Oh, God.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.836
Look at me, Neil.
Oh, God, Gil.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.871
GIL:
Look at me!

39:34.740 --> 39:36.542
Elevator's not working.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.543
Tristan must have
shut them down.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.778
He chained the stairwell, too,
locked us out.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.179
There should be
an emergency ladder

39:41.212 --> 39:42.681
inside the elevator shaft.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.750
It's not opening.
Get the hydraulic spreader.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.618
I can try to hack the elevator,
get in electronically.

39:46.652 --> 39:48.086
No, we don't have time for that.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.088
We're gonna get to Tristan
the same way

39:50.121 --> 39:51.890
he got to Isabel--
over the Internet.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.760
Please, you don't want
to do this.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.428
Yes, I do.

39:56.462 --> 39:59.798
You deserve to die
for what you did.

39:59.831 --> 40:00.932
You took her from me.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.133
RYAN:
Tristan, listen to me.

40:02.167 --> 40:05.637
Isabel would not
want this for you.

40:05.671 --> 40:06.605
Shut up!

40:06.638 --> 40:08.940
You don't know
what she would have wanted!

40:08.974 --> 40:10.809
You didn't know her like I did!

40:12.511 --> 40:13.712
No one did.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.447
RYAN:
No, you're right.

40:15.481 --> 40:16.982
Nobody knew her like you did.

40:17.015 --> 40:20.452
She shared all her secrets
with you.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.821
But what about the rest
of your family?

40:22.854 --> 40:24.723
Your grandpa.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.559
Your brother
with the new baby.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.027
Your sister in college.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.029
Tristan, if you do this,

40:31.062 --> 40:33.799
you will lose them all forever.

40:33.832 --> 40:36.802
Put the gun down, Tristan.

40:36.835 --> 40:40.739
Put it down and keep living
for your family.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.808
That is what Isabel would want.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.843
(crying)

40:56.087 --> 40:57.823
MUNDO: Tristan Jenkins,
hands in the air!

40:57.856 --> 40:59.958
Hands in the air,
on the ground now!

40:59.991 --> 41:01.159
Get on the ground!

41:03.194 --> 41:04.930
You stay right there.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.632
(Tristan whimpers, sobs)

41:07.933 --> 41:10.569
GEORGIA: Gil! Gil!
(sobbing): Oh, my God.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.504
MUNDO: Drop it.
RYAN:
What's happening?

41:12.538 --> 41:14.573
(crying):
Oh, my God! Gil!

41:14.606 --> 41:19.277
(Georgia sobbing deeply,
sobs echoing)

41:19.310 --> 41:21.513
MUNDO (echoing):
Take him away.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.815
(echoing): EMT, Tampa
Capital, top floor.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.119
(indistinct radio transmission)

41:30.989 --> 41:32.991
Wait...

41:35.126 --> 41:37.295
Tristan.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.598
I didn't know
Gil was gonna be here.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.535
I was supposed to kill Neil.

41:43.569 --> 41:44.903
Me, not him.

41:47.105 --> 41:51.042
She's gone.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.879
She's gone,
and I can never have her back.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.915
Tristan...

41:56.948 --> 41:59.551
I don't even know
if you can understand this,

41:59.585 --> 42:02.153
but you are gonna be brought up
on charges, too.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.155
(siren whoops in distance)

42:04.189 --> 42:08.193
Isabel would have liked you.
