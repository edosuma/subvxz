17:00.520 --> 17:06.550
I am delighted to be here in Cairo
to meet with Colonel Nasser

17:06.840 --> 17:12.472
to continue discussions about the funding
for his grand Aswan Darn project.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.349
His Arabic is good.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.998
Very good.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.155
Too good.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.999
Your Excellency, Prime Minister Eden.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.794
Is anything the matter?

17:59.320 --> 18:02.232
No one told me it was formal dress tonight.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.796
No matter, sir, it's just a suit.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.232
But the wrong suit.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.519
If I was as decorated as you sir

18:23.160 --> 18:26.709
I would wear my uniform all the time.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.636
Wouldn't take it off.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.957
You think I don't know?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.793
That you received
the Military Cross for bravery

18:38.360 --> 18:40.999
in the First World War

18:41.360 --> 18:45.831
and you were the youngest Brigade Major
in the British army, at twenty-one.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.477
You are more decorated than me...

52:26.560 --> 52:31.759
Britain and the West despise Arabs.

52:32.720 --> 52:36.998
Prime Minister Eden thinks he can insult us.

52:40.200 --> 52:43.476
We will fight to the last drop of our blood...
