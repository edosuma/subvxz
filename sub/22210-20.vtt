00:02.127 --> 00:03.538
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.629 --> 00:06.417
Together, you and Cynthia
could be an unstoppable duo.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.918
<i>You wanna be the new Breacher?</i>

00:08.007 --> 00:10.375
Your thinking cap and the dark matter
is what caused this.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.459
I know!

00:11.553 --> 00:13.465
How long before everything I know
is gone?

00:13.555 --> 00:15.717
<i>DeVoe has taken out
everyone who has gotten in his way.</i>

00:15.807 --> 00:18.470
<i>He created 12 meta-humans
just so he could steal their powers.</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:20.301
<i>But why does he need
their powers?</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:23.684
<i>The fire
that burns down Team Flash</i>

00:23.774 --> 00:26.437
will also light the path
to the enlightenment.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.111
<i>Since the Age of Enlightenment,</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:33.065
when reason, debate,
and the search for truth flourished,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.864
the world has improved by nearly
every measure in human advancement

00:36.954 --> 00:38.115
and continues to do so.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.821
There is no doubt in my mind

00:39.915 --> 00:42.623
that, as technology continues to bloom,

00:43.085 --> 00:44.621
so will all of humanity...

00:46.463 --> 00:49.171
Professor DeVoe, you disagree?

00:49.258 --> 00:52.046
Um, well, yes, I guess, um...

00:52.177 --> 00:55.545
Just... I have
a more realistic view of humanity

00:55.639 --> 00:57.631
whenever technology is concerned.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.714
What do you mean?

00:58.809 --> 01:00.971
You spoke of the Enlightenment.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.018
One only has to look at history
to find the answers.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.438
Okay. Let's. Life expectancy,

01:05.524 --> 01:07.857
over the past two centuries,
has increased

01:07.943 --> 01:10.276
from 50 years to nearly 70 years.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.025
And... And we should assume
that's a good thing?

01:13.115 --> 01:15.653
Each new day, we have to share
very limited resources

01:15.742 --> 01:18.655
with anything up to 200,000
newborn babies,

01:18.745 --> 01:22.705
most of whom will end up living
in abject poverty and famine.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.124
Well, thank you very much,
Professor Doom and Gloom.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.203
Remind me never to take
one of your history classes.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.298
Perhaps you should.
There's much I could teach you.

01:35.721 --> 01:39.715
The Taoists, in pursuit of immortality,
discovered gun powder.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.513
Alfred Nobel created the Nobel Prize

01:42.644 --> 01:45.603
so he wouldn't be remembered
as the man who invented dynamite.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.565
History has shown us time and time again

01:48.734 --> 01:51.727
that whenever a technological
advancement can be used

01:51.903 --> 01:54.566
to hurt humanity, it will be.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.817
You can't blame technology

01:55.907 --> 01:57.648
for the way men
choose to use it, Professor.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.487
You can't ignore that the best
of ideas by the smartest of men

02:01.622 --> 02:04.035
often have a way of becoming corrupted.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.506
You've located everything we need.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.251
And now the time has come to retrieve it

02:16.345 --> 02:17.802
so we can finally

02:19.097 --> 02:20.759
enlighten the world.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.270
Uh-oh.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.574
Hey, babe. Uh, it's me.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.289
Just checking in for my dad.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.380
He really wants to know your answer
about taking the Breacher job.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.253
I think his exact words were,

02:56.343 --> 02:58.175
"That little son of a breach
better tell me,

02:58.303 --> 03:00.761
"or they will never
find the body." Yeah.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.755
But you know what? He's retired.
He can wait.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.556
So just take as much time as you need.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.633
Okay, it's, um...

03:05.852 --> 03:07.184
- Don't say it's fine.
<i>- You know...</i>

03:07.270 --> 03:08.932
- Don't say it's fine.
- It's fine.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.354
- Oh, God.
- It's fine.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.437
So just vibe me whenever.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.234
Okay. Bye.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.937
<i>Ramon, speed lab, now.</i>

03:18.031 --> 03:21.820
Good. Good. Good.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.319
The thing we're gonna do
to get Killer Frost to appear,

03:24.413 --> 03:27.451
get that massive spike in your
adrenaline production that we need,

03:27.708 --> 03:31.042
is Ramon is gonna use his vibes
to shake you up on a cellular level

03:31.128 --> 03:32.915
and we'll see if we can get
your old friend Killer Frost

03:33.004 --> 03:34.370
to come out to play.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.838
Are you sure this is gonna work?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.460
Well, I mean, like any hypothesis,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.838
we have to test it to get an answer.
It's what we've all done

03:39.928 --> 03:41.590
since the fourth grade, known as the...

03:41.972 --> 03:43.053
Scientific method.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.427
Yeah, right you are, Allen. Of course.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.225
Ah! Here he is. Okay, good.
So, get in position.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.187
Don't worry.
I lowered the amps on this thing.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.099
- Ramon, you set?
- Yeah.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.608
- Snow, you ready?
- I'm ready.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.441
Three, two, one, and...

04:03.535 --> 04:05.993
- Nothing.
- All right, Ramon, more power.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.118
Set? Three, two, one...

04:12.753 --> 04:15.291
All right, this isn't working.
You know what? Ramon, full power.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.463
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
What do you mean, full power?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.005
We don't wanna blast Caitlin
across the speed lab.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.879
Well, we need to get a spike
in her adrenaline.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.176
- Harry, she could get injured.
- Yeah.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.378
God, this is...

04:23.722 --> 04:26.465
Look, this is gonna work, okay?
Nothing has changed. All right?

04:27.726 --> 04:29.718
Snow's DNA tests, they confirm it.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.768
Her meta-DNA was not spliced
by Null's powers.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.393
- You mean Melting Point's powers.
- That... Right. That's what I said.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.145
- Melting Point's powers.
- No, you didn't.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.270
I did say that.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.898
But, Harry, there's no dark matter
in her system anyway.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.069
We're just trying to spike
her heart rate.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.985
What do you mean,
there's no dark matter?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.950
Harry, you knew that. We all did.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.826
We did? We did.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.996
No, I know.
I think I just, you know, forget.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.370
- I forgot.
- You forgot?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.622
Harry, are you okay?

04:58.757 --> 05:01.170
No. He's not.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.715
Harry, you're...

05:05.806 --> 05:08.048
Losing my intelligence? Yes.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.467
The injection of dark matter
from the thinking cap

05:10.560 --> 05:12.176
apparently overwhelmed my synapses.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.929
Instead of making my brain faster,

05:16.650 --> 05:17.640
it's slowing it down.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.610
Why didn't you tell us this sooner?

05:24.366 --> 05:27.029
- How long until...
- No way of knowing.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.616
I mean, there are days
I can think clearly, and other days,

05:31.206 --> 05:32.868
I... I can't.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.996
The good news is, um,

05:37.546 --> 05:40.880
from what I can see,
the regression seems to be reversible.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.173
Okay, great.
I'll start working on it full-time.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.468
No, you won't. I did this to myself,

05:45.554 --> 05:48.092
and I thought, "Oh, you know what?
Use that thinking cap.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.719
"Then I can out-think DeVoe
and then stop DeVoe."

05:52.310 --> 05:54.893
I was wrong. And here we are.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.312
Okay, well, we're gonna fix this.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.812
You and I both know
there is a ticking clock,

06:01.319 --> 06:02.730
and I can't help anyone like this.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.941
- Yes, you can.
- How?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.324
Look, guys.

06:13.248 --> 06:16.161
Ralph, Caitlin's powers, now this.

06:17.085 --> 06:21.705
DeVoe knew how to break us apart,
but, I mean, we're all still here.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.626
We're a family.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.083
That's how we're gonna beat DeVoe.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.423
All right, Allen.

06:29.848 --> 06:30.884
All right.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.103
Vandermeer Steel.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.938
Smaller than I expected.

06:42.027 --> 06:46.146
The first step to our enlightenment
is as simple

06:49.659 --> 06:52.572
as opening a door.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.165
Alloy 1771.

07:05.926 --> 07:11.672
Now, the gallium antimonide
substrates within these

07:11.765 --> 07:16.055
can harness power at 400% efficiency.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.520
The precise amount I calculated.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.979
You can pick them up.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.481
Freeze!

07:32.410 --> 07:33.776
You should let us leave.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.951
I can't do that.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.030
Yes, you can.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.368
How are you...

07:47.342 --> 07:49.004
We have what we need.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.503
I suppose we do.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.639
Code Red! Code Red...

08:00.772 --> 08:03.264
Clifford, this is unnecessary.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.351
You knew there were gonna be
casualties when we began.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.144
This is his own doing.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.066
Yes, my love.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.914
What are we dealing with?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.247
Uh, first of all, we're trying
to determine what was in that vault.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.626
Watch your step right here.

08:28.717 --> 08:32.210
Uh, there was no drilling.
There was no lock picked.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.635
And the only thing anybody would tell us

08:33.763 --> 08:34.844
about what was in the vault

08:34.931 --> 08:36.888
was that it was some sort
of secretive technology.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.467
Also security guard here, 24-year-old,

08:39.561 --> 08:40.972
apparently shot himself.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.472
Wait. A robbery and a suicide?

08:42.563 --> 08:46.308
He's newly married,
has an infant at home. I...

08:46.401 --> 08:48.233
This is smelling like some
meta-madness to me.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.983
Who else can Kilg%re a retinal scan
and Dibny a bolt lock?

08:52.073 --> 08:53.063
Hmm.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.366
Okay, well, I'm gonna go interview
some people, see what I can find out.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.614
All right. Cisco and I will try
to figure out what DeVoe stole.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.240
All right. I'll be over here.

08:59.831 --> 09:03.950
Okay, so where should we start?
I'm thinking if we can gain

09:08.089 --> 09:09.421
access to their files...

09:09.507 --> 09:11.294
Alloy 1771.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.626
It's the only item missing
from the inventory files.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.379
Or I can just stand here
and look pretty.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.805
Hey, you know what
you could do actually?

09:17.891 --> 09:18.881
You could vibe the gun.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.183
The file didn't say what Alloy 1771 was,

09:21.269 --> 09:23.727
so we need another way to learn
why DeVoe would want it.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.100
Uh, vibing and DeVoe
do not mix, remember?

09:26.191 --> 09:28.433
I know, man, but, I mean, what are
we supposed to do? It's the only way.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.267
Barry, I don't really feel
like getting blasted

09:30.361 --> 09:32.728
into a wall right now.
I'm sure there is another way

09:32.822 --> 09:34.688
we can find out what this is

09:34.783 --> 09:36.490
that doesn't require me
getting a migraine.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.568
- It is a solar panel.
- Huh.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.698
Constructed of metal
that absorbs and multiplies

09:40.830 --> 09:43.368
the sun's energy at 400% efficiency.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.121
What would DeVoe be doing
with a solar panel?

09:46.211 --> 09:48.794
Nothing on its own.
He's got to be building something.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.167
Look, I need you to vibe the gun.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.673
Maybe I should put this
in movie terms for you.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.844
Everything in DeVoe's wake is like
the <i>Home Alone</i> house. Okay?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.216
It's booby trapped.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.925
I would need to double my powers
just to even attempt to vibe the gun.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.019
Well, hold on. I mean,
could Gypsy double your powers?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.012
- That's a good idea.
- No. Not.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.647
Not what?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.188
Gypsy's busy. Her dad just retired.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.441
She's having to do double the work.
She's... Earth-19 is a mess right now.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.772
- She's swamped.
- Cisco.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.734
Combining your powers could make it
so we know DeVoe's next move.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.163
<i>Thanks for meeting me.</i>

10:24.249 --> 10:25.865
- I need a favor.
- Okay.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.452
I need you to distract Cecile
for a while.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.249
What for?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.922
Well, it's a thing I can't tell you
because if I do,

10:34.008 --> 10:35.840
she'll read your mind and find out.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.259
Why can't Iris do it?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.053
Because Iris knows exactly
why I'm trying to distract Cecile.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.130
Ah.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.386
And therefore Barry knows,
which means that Cisco knows.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.967
Fine. Whatever you need.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.393
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.845
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.478
Great. Lose my mind,
become a babysitter.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.934
No, come on.

10:53.236 --> 10:57.150
Listen, if anybody's gonna reverse
what's happening,

10:57.282 --> 10:58.989
it's gonna be those kids
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.193
I mean, they love you, Harry,
and they will never stop

11:02.287 --> 11:03.778
- trying to help you.
- Mmm.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.996
- So don't lose hope.
- Right.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.160
And that is how I aced

11:11.254 --> 11:14.122
my intro to heat transfer
in my first year at university.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.749
Bravo, Dr. Milan.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.919
I miss those days.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.089
I was young and foolish and brave.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.390
And now you're just foolish.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.933
To agree to a date with someone
I first met

11:27.020 --> 11:30.479
as they were so rudely disagreeing
with my professional opinion.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.645
Foolish, maybe.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.402
You know,
no one's ever challenged me like that.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.656
It was refreshing.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.621
Ah, maybe you are right about
technology's destructiveness.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.448
It certainly can destroy moments.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.201
Although, sometimes,

11:53.004 --> 11:55.747
technology can create them as well.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.577
Thanks for coming to help us, Gypsy.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.825
You two are up.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.577
So how do we do this?

12:31.751 --> 12:35.244
Okay, so to co-vibe,
we have to be totally in sync.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.580
Right? Our minds have to be
on exactly the same page.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.166
- Just like always.
- Yeah.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.560
- Oh! So that was weird.
- Why? What did you see?

12:51.646 --> 12:53.182
I don't know. A dock?

12:53.356 --> 12:56.190
- Um, looked like a shipping container.
- Number 16.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.484
That must be what DeVoe
is gonna steal next.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.482
He's gonna have to steal it from us.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.152
All right.
It looks like we made it in time.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.454
Whatever is in this container,
we can't let DeVoe have it.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.657
Actually,

13:13.459 --> 13:17.453
it's what's in this container
you can't let me have.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.465
Well, what was in this container.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.717
Hit him!

13:36.441 --> 13:40.230
Gratitude for the workout,
brief as it was.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.023
Later.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.323
Damn it. Damn it!

13:51.289 --> 13:53.155
Why didn't we see the right
container number?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.496
Maybe someone's vibe
wasn't clear enough, Cisco.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.369
Are you blaming me?

13:59.797 --> 14:01.379
You lost you focus. What can I say?

14:01.883 --> 14:04.671
Yeah, getting hit against a metal
container wall sort of does that.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.048
You know, I hit that wall, too,
I'm perfectly focused.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.095
Oh, well, if you're so focused,
then why did you let him get away?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.798
Don't even try and put that on me.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.009
I'm sorry. I didn't put that on you.
You put that on you.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.219
I'm gonna put my fist in your face,
is what I'm gonna do.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.436
- Guys?
- Is that how we'd work together

14:16.522 --> 14:17.512
if I took the job?

14:17.607 --> 14:18.814
Guys.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.774
What job?

14:25.782 --> 14:27.990
I brought that metal piece
from the shipping container

14:28.076 --> 14:30.568
in case we wanna try co-vibing later,

14:31.662 --> 14:34.245
but, um, I think we both saw
where that led us, so...

14:35.208 --> 14:37.791
So you said Breacher retired.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.578
He offered you a job on Earth-19
to replace him, didn't he?

14:41.672 --> 14:42.788
Mmm-hmm.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.373
You know, another shot in the dark,

14:44.467 --> 14:47.380
but you haven't actually given
Breacher or Gypsy an answer yet.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.757
- Mmm-mmm.
- Which way are you leaning?

14:50.765 --> 14:52.757
I wanna be with Gypsy
more than anything.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.307
It's just complicated.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.347
Hey, no, man, I get it.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.689
But, look, I mean,

15:01.401 --> 15:05.111
maybe you guys working together
to end this

15:05.196 --> 15:07.688
will make the decision easier
for both of you.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.648
What if she doesn't want
the same thing as me?

15:10.618 --> 15:12.484
I mean,
you're never gonna know unless you ask.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.620
And listen, Cisco, I mean,

15:16.249 --> 15:17.865
we can't beat DeVoe without you.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.167
You're our secret weapon.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.420
You and Gypsy just need to be on the
same page for that weapon to work.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.793
Yeah, and I don't know that we can be.

15:26.175 --> 15:30.294
All right, well, let me help you.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.637
- Barry.
- No, like... Hold on.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.516
So that's gonna end well.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.180
Last one.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.598
Okay, we, uh, need food.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.150
We need wine.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.486
Lots of both. Go. I'll unpack.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.731
Clifford!

15:53.161 --> 15:54.151
Go. Hurry home.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.235
- I could stay.
- No.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.319
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.280
I really should. Last chance.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.487
Me hunter.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.241
Me hunted feast for my queen.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.948
You don't believe these things
you wrote in this journal, do you?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.835
This reads
like some radical's manifesto, Clifford.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.376
It is a realist's awakening.

16:53.888 --> 16:57.802
You declare war against every
technological philanthropist.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.474
Man, man, man.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.432
They're pushing us to the brink
of Armageddon

17:02.522 --> 17:03.808
with their inventions.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.064
No, they want to better mankind.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.650
Don't be naive, Marlize.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.695
The severity of our society's failings

17:13.782 --> 17:16.275
require extreme ideas

17:16.368 --> 17:20.079
if ever we were to restore
some semblance of balance.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.749
"Technology has become a cancerous
cell in our social biology.

17:24.835 --> 17:28.044
"Exorcizing it
would require a total purge,

17:28.130 --> 17:32.044
"not only of the material world,
but also human consciousness."

17:32.635 --> 17:35.048
This is not balance.
This is lobotomizing people.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.172
It is rebooting the masses' brains

17:38.266 --> 17:40.599
to let them forget their
technological crutches.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.517
They are babies with pacifiers.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.475
Oh, and who will teach them?
You, Professor?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.182
How does any of this help humankind?

17:48.317 --> 17:50.024
Don't you see, Marlize?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.897
Our technology is killing us.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.909
You and I, we can fix this together

18:00.788 --> 18:01.824
as partners.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.498
We can lead them,
all of society, humanity,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.622
on the true path to enlightenment.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.213
Hey, Harry.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.671
DA Cecile Horton.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.764
Joe said you needed to adjust
my mental activity dampener.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.268
Yes. Joe, yes. I have to do that.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.604
It's, um... It's not a big deal.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.268
It's a standard procedure.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.607
That's... Yeah, okay.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.857
- I'm in.
- Well,

18:38.784 --> 18:42.744
it's installing, so now you just...
You just sit

18:44.123 --> 18:47.537
and wait for a long time.

18:50.713 --> 18:54.002
Okay, what is happening
with your thoughts right now?

18:55.426 --> 18:56.883
With my...

18:56.969 --> 19:00.212
Okay. So there was an incident
with dark matter

19:00.306 --> 19:02.013
I know. I know. I know.
Joe told me about that.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.635
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What do you mean?

19:03.726 --> 19:06.844
Your thoughts are screaming at me.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.395
It's like they start to form, and then

19:09.940 --> 19:12.557
it's like the more the ideas appear...

19:12.652 --> 19:14.939
- The more they disappear.
- Exactly.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.438
Well, that explains my "can't" days.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.863
What does that mean, Harry?

19:19.909 --> 19:22.652
It means, DA Cecile Horton,

19:23.871 --> 19:26.204
that the more I try to use my brain,

19:27.041 --> 19:28.703
the sooner I'm gonna lose it.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.871
Barista, another one, please.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.422
Uh, make it a double. Thank you.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.375
Here you go.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.459
Thanks.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.670
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.802
Can't a woman caffeinate in peace
around here?

19:44.934 --> 19:47.426
Hey, look... Hey.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.557
I know why you're upset,
but it's all right.

19:49.647 --> 19:50.637
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.315
Look, Cisco just thinks if he takes
the job he'll be letting us down,

19:54.443 --> 19:56.526
but, I mean, he just needs
to follow his own heart,

19:56.654 --> 19:58.771
do what he needs to do,
not worry about us. He knows that.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.356
Wow.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.449
That's actually really great.

20:03.577 --> 20:07.241
So now all you guys have to do
is talk to each other.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.115
Yeah, well,
that part's not so easy, so...

20:10.376 --> 20:12.618
Yes, it is.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.793
- What are you doing?
- What?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.541
Don't even think about it.
Don't even think about it. No!

20:15.840 --> 20:16.830
Okay...

20:16.924 --> 20:18.506
Don't ever whoosh me again, all right?

20:18.592 --> 20:20.629
I know. Totally. I'm sorry. Um, Cisco.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.881
What is going on?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.178
Just getting them back
on the same page, okay?

20:24.598 --> 20:26.464
Cisco, Gypsy is upset because,
frankly, I mean,

20:26.559 --> 20:29.176
it's taking you too long accept
Breacher's job offer. Duh!

20:29.270 --> 20:33.105
And, Gypsy, Cisco, he's just worried
about abandoning his team.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.432
I mean, it's not that he doesn't
want the job. Right?

20:35.526 --> 20:37.358
So... Okay, so...

20:37.695 --> 20:42.235
Now, you both know, right,
and you can dive in

20:42.366 --> 20:43.982
and work this out.
Let's talk about this.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.413
C.C.P.D. is reporting two more
break-ins at tech manufacturers.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.290
Boeing Lab and the Jameson Institute.
More hardware was stolen.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.791
- DeVoe.
- Is anybody hurt?

20:57.882 --> 20:59.794
Um, three fatalities.
All of them security guards

20:59.884 --> 21:01.716
in high-level clearance areas,
just like at Vandermeer.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.340
He's taking whatever he wants,
killing anybody that gets in the way.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.589
Guys, I'm sorry,
but we have to figure out

21:07.683 --> 21:09.174
what kind of machine
he's building, right now.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.473
Look, we have to try.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.403
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.948
- Oh, God, are you okay?
- Saw that one coming.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.029
- You okay?
- I'm good. Thank you.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.258
- They okay?
- Tests show physically they're fine.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.677
As a couple, not so much.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.597
Where are you going?

21:49.683 --> 21:51.299
To get these two back in sync.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.259
I mean, we've got to get ahead
of this somehow.

21:53.354 --> 21:54.811
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, cowboy.

21:54.897 --> 21:55.887
What do you mean? Why?

21:55.981 --> 21:59.145
Maybe you've done enough already, okay?

21:59.235 --> 22:02.524
Cisco and Gypsy are clearly
going through something,

22:03.280 --> 22:05.488
and, you know, it's not up to us
to counsel them through it.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.315
- Well, then who is it up to, Iris?
- Just stop for a second.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.695
We can't stop.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.869
The second we do,
everyone could fall apart.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.287
The team's hanging on by a thread.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.490
- But we are hanging on, Barry.
- For how long?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.951
I mean, look at what's happening.
DeVoe is killing innocent people.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.538
He's stealing pieces of tech
for God knows why.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.419
Just trying to keep up with him
is tearing us apart.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.125
Babe.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.962
You can't put it on yourself
to hold everyone together.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.436
Cisco is family.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.981
And when family hurts, we all hurt.
I get that.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.564
But sometimes, you can't answer
their questions for them.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.187
Sometimes, you just have to support them

22:45.281 --> 22:47.238
while they find them on their own
whether they're together

22:47.324 --> 22:48.735
or they're apart.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.863
- What?
- That's it.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.041
The pieces of tech don't fit together

22:58.627 --> 22:59.993
because they're not supposed to.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.046
He's not building one thing.
He's building multiple.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.803
Harry, I know this is hard.

23:11.849 --> 23:12.839
Well,

23:14.393 --> 23:15.383
it is hard,

23:16.186 --> 23:17.643
DA Cecile Horton, because my brain,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.642
the one thing that's defined me
throughout pretty much

23:19.732 --> 23:20.939
my entire life is about to...

23:23.027 --> 23:25.440
Vanish, and then who will I be?

23:25.863 --> 23:28.105
You'll be the exact same man
you've always been.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.152
Yeah, but dumb.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.277
Same man, way less intelligent.

23:33.370 --> 23:37.489
Harry, there are lots of ways
to be intelligent,

23:37.583 --> 23:38.869
not just using your head.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.289
Right.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.710
Wait.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.467
Do that again. Harry.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.423
- Do what?
- Do it again. Do it again.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.064
- Right?
- How did you do that?

24:03.150 --> 24:06.018
I saw it inside your mind
before it vanished.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.272
In...

24:07.363 --> 24:10.071
- Wait. So you can...
- Write down what you're thinking.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.364
- Before it...
- Disappears.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.567
- Wow.
- Yeah.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.994
Marlize? I brought the sample.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.822
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:20.751 --> 24:21.741
Okay.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.286
All right.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.249
- Fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.009
Here we go.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.933
Cheers.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.262
- Yes.
- Yeah?

24:42.356 --> 24:44.097
Yeah. Show the others.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.432
Got it.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.363
Hello.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.947
<i>Marlize, it's me.</i>

24:59.581 --> 25:00.571
Clifford.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.782
I need you to come home.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.666
I can't.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.959
I'm making a difference here.
I'm changing lives for the better.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.414
<i>These people need me.</i>

25:09.883 --> 25:10.999
I need you.

25:13.637 --> 25:14.844
I'm sorry.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.552
I can't be with someone that thinks
that society is a disease,

25:18.684 --> 25:22.303
that believes that our world
is being plagued by technology.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.304
I am nothing without you.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.857
You're a brilliant man
with a great future ahead of you.

25:27.943 --> 25:31.186
What kind of future do I have
if you're not by my side?

25:31.905 --> 25:34.238
I just wish that you could show

25:34.324 --> 25:37.783
the same compassion for the rest
of humanity as you do for me.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.116
Listen to me, Marlize. I...

25:42.416 --> 25:44.328
My thoughts, I can't...

25:44.418 --> 25:47.126
I just... I just don't think that...

25:53.427 --> 25:54.417
Marlize.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.595
<i>Marlize.</i>

25:58.432 --> 25:59.513
<i>Marlize!</i>

26:05.355 --> 26:08.348
So what were you gonna say

26:08.442 --> 26:11.150
before we were
so alarmingly interrupted?

26:15.491 --> 26:16.902
Look, I just...

26:20.245 --> 26:21.235
Cisco...

26:21.330 --> 26:23.572
- I don't want you to take the job.
- I don't want to take the job.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.032
Oh.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.494
That is such a relief.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.664
Because I don't want anything to change.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.637
Not only have we not
been on the same page,

26:44.645 --> 26:46.602
we haven't even been on the same planet.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.517
Literally.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.599
We've been doing this
back-and-forth thing

26:50.692 --> 26:51.853
for almost a year,

26:51.944 --> 26:54.061
negotiating who gets to go
to whose Earth and when,

26:54.154 --> 26:55.486
just to see each other.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.780
And on the off chance
we do get to see each other,

26:57.866 --> 26:59.323
there's, like, a countdown

26:59.409 --> 27:01.947
until one of us has to leave,
and I'm tired of it.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.780
I don't wanna have to breach to see
the woman I love.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.160
I wanna wake up next to her

27:07.251 --> 27:08.458
every morning.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.626
So what are you saying?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.297
I'm saying I want more.

27:15.175 --> 27:18.339
I'm saying I don't want Breacher's job,
but I do want you.

27:18.428 --> 27:19.669
I want you, too.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.379
What am I supposed to do?

27:21.890 --> 27:24.132
Pack up my entire life, everything?

27:24.226 --> 27:25.842
Forget about my job,
my responsibilities?

27:25.936 --> 27:27.268
- No, no, no.
- Just move here?

27:27.354 --> 27:28.890
No, no, no.
That's not what I'm asking you to do.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.643
I would never ask you
to leave the agency.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.564
I know how important that is to you.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.902
But tell me, and tell me honestly,

27:37.281 --> 27:38.897
this, what we have,

27:40.868 --> 27:42.234
is this enough for you?

27:45.414 --> 27:46.621
Yes.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.032
It is.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.751
Well, it isn't for me.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.464
<i>Hey, guys,
I need you both in the Cortex.</i>

28:00.804 --> 28:01.885
- Why?
- Why?

28:01.972 --> 28:04.339
I know what DeVoe is doing.
It's not one machine.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.464
They're machines.

28:05.559 --> 28:08.017
Machines that work together,
but they're still separate.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.719
Satellites.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.647
Separate satellites working together
for a single purpose?

28:13.317 --> 28:15.024
So this guy really is a Bond villain.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.443
Look, DeVoe would need a massive
amount of computational power

28:17.529 --> 28:19.191
for them to be able to talk
to each other,

28:19.281 --> 28:21.989
something to triangulate navigation
between each satellite.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.657
So, like a quantum computer?

28:25.037 --> 28:26.994
Mercury Labs just put a whole system

28:27.080 --> 28:28.946
of quantum computers online
at their home base.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.202
- That's where he's going.
- Okay, great.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.249
This time we catch DeVoe by surprise.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.256
Behold.

28:40.010 --> 28:43.674
The key to communicating our message
of the enlightenment.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.431
Polynomial time computing.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.470
And a dream shall soon become reality.

29:20.801 --> 29:21.791
Clifford!

29:24.304 --> 29:25.840
Uh-uh. Don't move.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.513
Barry, knock him out and then cuff him.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.760
On it.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.098
Gypsy, now.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.315
Stop it! You're killing him!

29:48.787 --> 29:49.903
Cisco, look out.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.156
Barry, hit him again.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.375
Enough!

30:01.174 --> 30:02.164
Caitlin.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.091
Caitlin, what the hell are you doing?

30:07.180 --> 30:08.591
Bringing her back.

30:12.686 --> 30:13.927
DeVoe's creating a sonic pulse.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.262
You need to get out of there before...

30:24.239 --> 30:25.605
Oh, I get it.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.734
You'd like me to frighten you
into becoming your better half.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.742
Gladly.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.491
DeVoe!

30:36.126 --> 30:37.537
Children should be seen, not heard.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.795
I'm very sure seeing your bestie die

30:40.881 --> 30:43.999
would be frightening enough,
but I can't kill the Flash.

30:44.634 --> 30:45.670
Well, not just yet.

30:45.761 --> 30:48.219
My plan for the enlightenment

30:48.305 --> 30:50.217
requires his further participation.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.808
You, however, are a lot less fortunate.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.346
Barry, he's gonna kill Gypsy.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.815
Now, do you feel that

31:00.901 --> 31:02.563
around your throat?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.194
That is the gravitational equivalent

31:05.280 --> 31:07.863
of my boot bursting your wind pipe.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.484
She's innocent! Leave her alone!

31:11.995 --> 31:13.031
Clifford.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.285
This isn't part of our plan.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.912
Cisco, wake up! Wake up!

31:20.962 --> 31:22.578
Our plan is to save them.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.710
We can't save everyone, my love.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.045
DeVoe!

31:27.803 --> 31:28.793
Perhaps.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.755
But I won't watch you kill
an innocent life again.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.475
Yes, you will.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.729
Please. Clifford.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.108
Remember who you are.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.286
Is this truly the lesson
you wish to bestow today?

32:12.764 --> 32:13.880
Get the case.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.361
- Cynthia.
- Hey.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.690
What happened? Come on. It's okay.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.190
<i>What did he do to her?</i>

32:34.494 --> 32:36.952
Hey, talk to me. Come on. It's okay.

32:46.590 --> 32:49.173
You're okay. You're okay.

32:57.267 --> 32:59.634
No thefts have been reported
in the last 12 hours.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.261
So DeVoe managed to get
everything he needed.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.481
And we still don't know
what his next step is.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.397
You know, he said something
about the enlightenment.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.688
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.022
I know what he's thinking.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.366
I know what he's planning.
We know what he's planning.

33:16.453 --> 33:17.660
- We know what he's planning.
- Harry... Harry, wait.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.078
- What?
- I can give 'em the CliffsNotes version.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.154
No, no, no.

33:20.457 --> 33:24.326
The component parts stolen
to create each satellite will possess

33:24.669 --> 33:27.002
thirty cubic quantum systems, okay?

33:27.088 --> 33:29.671
And each system is capable of...

33:29.799 --> 33:32.337
Each system is capable of redirecting

33:32.427 --> 33:33.963
concentrated dark matter back to Earth

33:34.054 --> 33:35.670
in 10 million megawatt bursts.

33:35.764 --> 33:40.475
Which level of range is toxic enough
to affect each and every human brain

33:40.560 --> 33:43.223
on the planet
and reboot them back to a...

33:43.313 --> 33:46.681
Reboot them back to a simplified state.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.816
Just like mine.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.101
DeVoe wants to remove

33:51.196 --> 33:52.732
the intelligence of everyone on Earth?

33:52.822 --> 33:56.782
Yes. Exactly, Barry. Exactly right.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.469
We're really gonna do this?

34:27.148 --> 34:28.514
You treat me

34:29.734 --> 34:31.817
like I'm the only woman
in the multi-verse,

34:31.902 --> 34:33.518
and I don't want more.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.775
What is wrong with me?

34:37.367 --> 34:39.199
I don't know what's wrong with me.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.658
I'm sorry.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.534
Nothing's wrong.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.034
Nothing at all.

34:55.927 --> 35:00.217
I guess maybe sometimes
one plus one just equals two, you know?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.264
What are you gonna do?

35:23.204 --> 35:25.412
Wait. Wait.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.724
Goodbye, Cynthia.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.894
Goodbye, Cisco.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.038
- Surprise!
- What is this?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.996
It's your baby shower, baby.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.290
This is why you were singing
"The Girl from Ipanema"

36:17.384 --> 36:18.716
in your head all day.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.259
He has been planning this for days.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.881
Oh! This is so sweet.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.010
I feel really guilty, pulling
everybody away at a time like this,

36:25.100 --> 36:26.261
- but...
- It's a perfect time to celebrate.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.467
- Surrounded by family.
- Mmm.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.687
You guys,
this baby is gonna be so loved.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.263
Aw.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.438
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.200
Why don't you go talk to him?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.077
Hey, man, are you okay?

36:57.298 --> 36:58.755
Not really. No.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.131
Do you want some space, or...

37:03.596 --> 37:05.508
Actually, I've got plenty of that
right now.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.730
I'm sorry for pushing the two of you.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.151
I think you both did
the right thing, though.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.365
Then why does it hurt so much?

37:34.210 --> 37:35.746
Caitlin.

37:36.296 --> 37:38.162
Look, I don't think
you should do that again.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.747
You could have gotten yourself killed.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.587
I have to get her back.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.174
- We will.
- No, I will.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.593
<i>Clifford. Clifford.</i>

37:53.855 --> 37:54.845
Ow.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.271
It's fine.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.102
It's fine.

38:03.740 --> 38:07.154
When the line cut out,
I came immediately.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.738
I thought I'd lost you.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.123
You'll never lose me, Clifford.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.161
You were right.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.746
Technology has become a cancer,

38:20.840 --> 38:23.924
driving civilization to consume itself.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.887
A militia group found out about
the water purifier that I created.

38:30.642 --> 38:35.262
And they just killed dozens
of people to take it.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.689
Women and children slaughtered

38:39.776 --> 38:42.018
for a simple piece of technology.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.656
Your journal

38:48.576 --> 38:50.818
wrote of a world where humanity forgot

38:50.912 --> 38:53.746
that this technological menace
was capable.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.833
But what I didn't tell you

38:59.671 --> 39:01.583
was that I saw the truth in it
even then,

39:03.007 --> 39:04.373
and it frightened me.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.715
And that's why I ran.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.515
And I'm not frightened anymore.

39:14.602 --> 39:15.934
You believe.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.511
I believe in you.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.018
Enlighten them, Clifford.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.809
You're the only one who can.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.826
I'm nothing without you.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.551
The chair will rejuvenate
your fractured scaphoid.

39:52.015 --> 39:53.677
Prepare the satellites for assembly.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.977
- I said prepare the satellites...
- No!

40:04.861 --> 40:07.194
Initially, we set out
to enlighten the world.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.235
Now, you want to rule it.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.401
I am leaving you, Clifford.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.830
Nothing can get in or out.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.167
You dare orchestrate an exodus

40:26.257 --> 40:28.874
on the eve
of humanity's greatest reckoning?

40:30.178 --> 40:32.511
- You made a vow.
- To my husband!

40:34.474 --> 40:36.056
But my husband is dead.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.926
The Thinker's first victim.

40:40.355 --> 40:43.769
The enlightenment will come
for you, too, Marlize.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.980
I will be all that remains.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.399
Oh, Clifford.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.735
You are nothing without me.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.456
Special delivery.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.590
- Oh!
- Wow. You're super pregnant.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.877
Looks like you're due about 21 days
from tonight, I'd say.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.508
I... I mean, if I were guessing.

41:15.682 --> 41:16.798
Sweetheart, who is it?

41:16.891 --> 41:19.053
Uh, someone sent us a diaper bag.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.342
Mmm.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.643
It looks like it's a gift from someone

41:21.771 --> 41:23.683
who wanted you both to know
how special you are,

41:23.773 --> 41:26.732
someone who understands that
time is precious

41:27.193 --> 41:28.400
and right now is all we've got.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.476
Mmm-hmm.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.312
Relatively speaking.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.612
- Dad?
- Hey.

41:32.699 --> 41:33.815
- Look what we got.
- Oh.

41:34.867 --> 41:35.948
Who sent that? Wally?

41:36.035 --> 41:37.651
Wally already sent us a bassinet,

41:37.745 --> 41:40.032
which apparently was owned by Moses.

41:41.541 --> 41:42.873
Was there a note...

41:45.003 --> 41:46.084
Who was it?

41:46.337 --> 41:47.498
Some delivery girl.
