Are they for us?

04:39.801 --> 04:41.455
No one said we can.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.761
No one said we can't,
though, right?

[door opens]

04:56.165 --> 04:58.123
[instrumental music]

05:07.219 --> 05:08.525
May I have one?

05:14.618 --> 05:15.924
Thank you.

05:21.451 --> 05:24.454
Oh, that's lovely. Mm.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.588
It's a particularly good one.
Mm.

05:27.631 --> 05:30.242
Come on, everyone.
Come and get one.

05:30.286 --> 05:33.028
[instrumental music]

05:33.071 --> 05:34.508
[chuckles]

06:00.882 --> 06:03.580
My name is Roald Dahl.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.539
Now, some of you
may be wondering

06:05.582 --> 06:08.629
why there was a bowl
with peaches in it.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.021
Well, that's because

06:10.065 --> 06:13.068
I've written a book
about a peach.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.157
A magical one.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.335
And what I'm going to do today
is read you some of it.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.034
- Hey, what about this stone?
- Oh. Uh...

06:23.078 --> 06:28.082
Well... do you think you can
get it in the bowl from there?

06:28.126 --> 06:30.651
- Easy.
- Is it?

06:30.694 --> 06:33.393
Yes. Well, I tell you what...

06:35.351 --> 06:37.788
How about backwards, hmm?

06:40.748 --> 06:43.054
[indistinct chatter]

[instrumental music]

[indistinct chatter]

07:15.260 --> 07:17.175
Augustus.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.481
Dad.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.616
Caught the tail end.
Very amusing.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.400
- Thank you.
- Pete Perkins.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.576
- What is?
- Ah, that's my name.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.361
Is that so? Good for you.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.712
Consider myself a bit of
a wordsmith, actually.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.235
A few poems here and there.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.759
The odd colorful
limerick at university.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.848
That sort of thing.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.068
I definitely think
I've got a book or two in me.

07:41.678 --> 07:44.464
Not a children's book,
of course.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.900
Something a bit-- bit weightier.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.467
- Weightier?
- Mm.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.338
Well done for
"Johnny And The Giant..."

07:49.381 --> 07:51.340
- Pineapple.
- Ah, thank you, yes.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.736
"Johnny And The Giant
Pineapple." [laughs]

07:58.260 --> 07:59.609
We've all got to start
somewhere, haven't we?

07:59.653 --> 08:01.045
I did originally
think peach, but--

08:01.089 --> 08:02.960
No. No, no, no.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.919
Kids can relate to a pineapple.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.877
Pineapple's the one.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.966
I shall give you my card.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.751
If things pick up for you,

08:10.794 --> 08:14.015
you might need
a decent solicitor.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.843
I'm much more
than just a lawyer, you know.

08:15.886 --> 08:18.236
Dog with a bone,
that's what I am.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.761
And that's exactly
what someone like you needs.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.633
If I was your dog, with a bone,

08:23.677 --> 08:27.289
I would be 120 percent
committed to...

08:29.160 --> 08:32.163
I say. Isn't that...

08:32.207 --> 08:34.296
"Klaatu barada nikto."

08:34.338 --> 08:35.645
- Patricia Neal.
- Who?

08:35.688 --> 08:37.952
Oh, come on.
Patricia Neal. Huge.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.866
Great big American movie star.

08:39.909 --> 08:41.738
- How did she get here?
- What, transport-wise?

08:41.782 --> 08:44.393
No, no, what's she doing here
at this sorry little affair

08:44.436 --> 08:46.134
in the middle of nowhere?

08:46.177 --> 08:47.875
Probably the wrong address.
You know actresses.

08:47.918 --> 08:51.400
None too bright
but nice to look at.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.402
- Rather.
- Well, she's nothing special.

08:53.445 --> 08:56.797
The sort of girl I'd soon have
wrapped round my finger.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.451
- In your dreams, old chap.
- Oh, really?

08:59.495 --> 09:02.846
I don't know if you're a
betting man, Mr. Perkins,

09:02.890 --> 09:08.199
but ten bob says that I leave
with Patricia Neal tonight.

09:08.243 --> 09:11.768
Okay. I'll take your money.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.640
Gus can be banker.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.996
Ms. Neal, allow me
to introduce myself.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.606
I'm Roald Dahl.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.695
- The Roald Dahl?
- One and the same.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.350
And this is my good friend,
Jerry Jenkins.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.613
Well, it's lovely
to meet you, Mr. Jenkins.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.746
Perkins, actually.
Pete Perkins.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.356
I'm sorry. I knew it was
something along those lines.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.097
And this is Gus.
Augustus, really.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.838
But he prefers Gus.
Don't you, Gus?

09:37.881 --> 09:41.102
- Pleasure to meet you, Gus.
- Wow.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.626
Funny thing, Patricia, if I may.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.454
Pete here's just bet me
ten shillings

09:45.497 --> 09:47.717
that I don't leave with you
tonight.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.200
Leave with me, as in...

09:52.243 --> 09:54.550
Well, Mr. Jenkins, really.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.899
- It wasn't my...
- Oh, come now.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.335
Didn't you just say
that actresses are

09:57.379 --> 10:00.382
none too bright
but nice to look at?

10:00.425 --> 10:02.906
- No, you just said that...
- So, how about it, Pat?

10:02.950 --> 10:05.517
I've a nice little place
the other side of Amersham.

10:05.561 --> 10:08.608
Well, Mr. Dahl,
I'm flattered by your offer,

10:08.651 --> 10:11.959
but well, I'm not sure
my husband would approve.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.831
Oh. You're married.
What a shame.

10:14.875 --> 10:18.008
Although I have to say, I am a
bit of a sucker for a tall man.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.314
Well, that's a bit of luck.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.750
Any other qualities
you look for?

10:20.794 --> 10:24.058
Well, let me think, now...

10:24.101 --> 10:27.365
There is one thing
I can't resist.

10:27.409 --> 10:30.064
That's a man who cooks
a good breakfast.

10:30.107 --> 10:33.415
Well, Ms. Neal, I have to tell
you that back in Great Missenden

10:33.458 --> 10:35.286
they call me
the King of Breakfasts.

10:35.330 --> 10:39.682
- Oh, do they, now?
- Hey. What about your husband?

10:39.726 --> 10:42.424
[whispers]
I won't tell him if you don't.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.078
So good to have met you, Gus.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.036
- No, no. All yours.
- Mr. Jenkins.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.472
Jerry.

10:53.261 --> 10:56.003
You, Mr. Dahl,
are one big kid.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.657
Is that so?

10:57.700 --> 11:01.008
And the day you stop
is the day I file for divorce.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.231
[instrumental music]

11:11.366 --> 11:15.196
Roald: We had two daughters.
The first we called Olivia.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.372
Olivia Twenty Dahl.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.417
Olivia from Twelfth Night.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.855
Twenty because that's all
the money I had in my pocket

11:21.898 --> 11:24.684
on the bright sunny day
she was born.

11:24.727 --> 11:28.557
Olivia. Our little zookeeper.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.516
Then there was
Chantal Sophia Dahl.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.040
Sophia after my mother.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.478
But we realized
she'd be Chantal Dahl.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.828
So she became Tessa.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.396
Tessa who always agreed
the best approach

11:41.439 --> 11:43.485
was to do things her own way,

11:43.528 --> 11:45.530
including sleeping
anywhere she could,

11:45.574 --> 11:48.751
so long as
it wasn't in her bed.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.145
And Theo,
the boy who we nearly lost

11:51.188 --> 11:52.712
in a traffic accident

11:52.755 --> 11:55.627
on a wet winter road
in New York City.

11:57.455 --> 12:00.763
Then, of course, Pat,
star of stage and screen.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.853
Now trying to keep her career
and her family afloat

12:03.897 --> 12:07.161
in a rickety old tub
we called Gipsy House.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.251
[instrumental music]

12:12.253 --> 12:14.385
And then we come in to land.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.780
[dog barks]

12:24.874 --> 12:27.094
Gabriel's wing's better now.

12:27.137 --> 12:29.357
It is, isn't it?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.403
He's not Gabriel.
He's Uriel.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.405
Do you call them
all after angels?

12:34.449 --> 12:36.146
They are all angels.

12:36.190 --> 12:39.193
Angels that shit everywhere,
that's for sure.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.498
Come on.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.979
[instrumental music]

12:43.023 --> 12:44.633
Roald: And his name
is Charlie Rocket.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.983
Olivia: Daddy, I love that
you call him that.

12:47.027 --> 12:49.333
Roald: He lives in a little
house with his mother and father

12:49.377 --> 12:50.900
and his father's
mother and father

12:50.944 --> 12:52.641
and his mother's
mother and father.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.383
Olivia: All in one house?
Roald: All in one bed.

12:55.426 --> 12:59.430
They're very poor, you see.
Poor and all called Bob.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.128
- All called Bob?
- Yes.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.912
Both grandmothers
are called Roberta.

13:02.956 --> 13:06.916
Then there's Grandpa Robert
and other Grandpa Robert.

13:06.960 --> 13:11.442
- [chuckles] That's funny.
- I don't know. It might work.

13:11.486 --> 13:15.142
- What sweets do they make?
- Oh, incredible ones.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.970
Fudge?
Can there be fudge?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.972
Oh, yes, there'll be
a whole lake of it.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.843
And gobstoppers?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.627
Oh, yes, they're your favorite,
aren't they?

13:22.671 --> 13:25.456
Yeah, but they never
last long enough.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.980
These ones will.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.809
In fact,
these will last forever.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.680
[instrumental music]

13:31.723 --> 13:35.640
He's the PT Barnum
of confectionery.

13:35.684 --> 13:38.121
He made a palace entirely
out of chocolate

13:38.165 --> 13:41.385
for a maharajah once.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.909
Prince Pilau.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.128
No.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.652
Prince Peeperpeepoo.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.525
No. Probably not that either.

13:50.568 --> 13:53.180
It'll come to me. Mm?

14:01.623 --> 14:03.930
[instrumental music]

14:07.324 --> 14:08.760
Careful.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.206
I don't know
why you like it so much.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.338
It's a shivery smile.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.559
Roald: A shivery smile.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.136
The other thing
that our man likes

14:36.179 --> 14:40.618
is to make fountains
out of sugar.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.838
The trouble is
it gets a bit sticky.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.275
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:52.674 --> 14:54.719
When's Livvy going to be home?

14:54.763 --> 14:56.678
They won't be too much longer,
darling.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.680
Go find something
and play until they get back.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.377
But I've played everything.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.466
Well, you can't have
played everything.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.816
I have. Really.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.470
Now, do you remember
what mommy said

15:06.514 --> 15:08.211
about having to work?

15:08.255 --> 15:10.648
Uh-huh, and I was
only to disturb you

15:10.692 --> 15:12.128
if it was an emergency.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.000
- That's right.
- Like now.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.093
And what is the emergency?

15:20.136 --> 15:22.312
Your feet are on fire.
Come on.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.231
Patricia: Pixies are sneaky
as gannets, they are.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.365
Do all sorts, they do,
when folk got their back turned.

15:31.408 --> 15:36.848
But the thing about pixies,
they go mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...

15:36.892 --> 15:39.025
But right quiet, like, so you
gotta keep

15:39.068 --> 15:41.853
a lughole peeled to 'ear 'em.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.725
Why are you talking like that?

15:43.768 --> 15:46.510
- Mommy's practicing, darling.
- What's all this?

15:46.554 --> 15:48.686
We're looking for pixies.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.993
Pixies?
In Buckinghamshire?

15:51.037 --> 15:54.692
Fat chance. No, you only get
pixies in Cornwall.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.173
- But mummy said...
- Well, silly mummy.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.567
And, daddy, daddy is right.

15:59.610 --> 16:02.439
In Buckinghamshire
we get fairies.

16:02.483 --> 16:05.268
- Fairies! We've got fairies.
- Well, yes, that's right.

16:05.312 --> 16:07.227
But the trouble with fairies,
you see,

16:07.270 --> 16:09.185
is-- is they're terribly shy,

16:09.229 --> 16:10.882
and so it's quite hard
to see them.

16:10.926 --> 16:14.930
Yes. Unless it's the third
of November, of course.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.366
When's that?

16:18.325 --> 16:20.936
Well, how-- how incredible.
That's today.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.329
What are the chances?

16:22.372 --> 16:25.636
And today is
Bubbalubbadumdum Day.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.247
What's Bubba-lubble Day?

16:27.290 --> 16:30.337
Bubbalubbadumdum Day is
the day that Oppletopple,

16:30.380 --> 16:33.209
king of the fairies, uh,

16:33.253 --> 16:35.690
leads a parade on a,
on a big black rabbit.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.432
- Like Trilby.
- Exactly like Trilby.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.651
Can we see it?

16:40.695 --> 16:43.741
Oh, well, now, let me think.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.006
Hey, darling.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.705
- Nothing yet?
- Oh, no.

16:50.748 --> 16:54.013
Both: Mummy, daddy, come and
see! Come and see! Quickly!

16:54.056 --> 16:55.623
Alright, alright.
Daddy will come.

16:55.665 --> 16:57.929
Mummy's got to take an
important call about a part.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.021
Well, well.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.589
Do you think
King Appleflapple will like it?

17:06.634 --> 17:10.855
Oppletopple? Of course he will.
It's magnificent.

17:10.898 --> 17:12.770
Can we see him on his rabbit?

17:12.814 --> 17:15.208
Well, as long as
it's not past bath time.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.036
Oh, dear. Which it is.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.778
But, daddy, you said we
could if we made a tribble.

17:20.821 --> 17:24.260
- Tribute.
- So can we?

17:24.304 --> 17:26.132
We'll have to see
in the morning. Mm?

17:28.656 --> 17:31.137
This isn't one of
your stories, is it?

17:35.228 --> 17:36.577
You'll see.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.067
Come on. I'm gonna get you!

17:50.156 --> 17:51.679
No, you aren't.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.987
No, come here!

17:56.031 --> 18:00.427
Livvy, I said not red ones.
Mommy has to pay those.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.950
Sorry.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.564
Is that what you want?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.131
You want them to fly away,
do you, Livvy?

18:09.175 --> 18:10.480
They'd come back.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.178
Well, I admire your optimism.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.354
They will. It's their home.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.881
Go and run your bath, will you?

18:25.321 --> 18:27.671
I'm withering on the vine here.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.153
- Darling...
- Don't.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.375
They say who they're going with?

18:35.418 --> 18:37.116
Rachel Roberts.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.683
Got the right sort of
earthiness to her, I suppose.

18:39.727 --> 18:40.728
And I don't?

18:40.771 --> 18:41.990
They're just used to seeing you

18:42.033 --> 18:44.166
in a fox fur
drinking a martini.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.125
What does that mean?
It's all I'm good for?

18:46.168 --> 18:48.214
- That's not what I'm saying.
- It doesn't matter.

18:48.257 --> 18:51.391
I've, I've still got that
crappy airport thing.

18:51.434 --> 18:54.089
Well, like I said, don't do it
if you don't want to.

18:54.133 --> 18:58.137
That is ripe coming from
the man whose last advance

18:58.180 --> 19:00.356
wouldn't even cover a
case of that Scotch

19:00.400 --> 19:01.966
you're always so
fond of downing.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.185
My writing pays.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.665
It would
pay a hell of a lot more

19:04.708 --> 19:06.710
if you weren't so bloody-minded.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.103
What's that supposed to mean?

19:08.147 --> 19:13.543
It means,
kids want Enid Blyton.

19:13.587 --> 19:17.199
Not the twisted crap
that comes out of your head.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.592
Oh, sod you, Pat.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.289
I was only bloody
trying to be nice.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.603
[instrumental music]

19:34.260 --> 19:35.783
You can shut up.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.763
[music continues]

20:26.007 --> 20:30.403
Now, now... where were we?

20:30.446 --> 20:33.406
- Chapter five.
- Ah.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.973
Yes, the river of marshmallow.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.110
You're going to drink all that?

20:42.153 --> 20:44.286
You're starting to
sound like our mother.

21:40.516 --> 21:45.565
â™ª It was fascination

21:45.608 --> 21:48.655
â™ª I know

21:48.698 --> 21:55.444
â™ª And it might have ended right
there at the start â™ª

21:56.924 --> 22:00.884
â™ª Just a passing glance

22:00.928 --> 22:05.411
â™ª Just a brief romance

22:05.454 --> 22:07.543
â™ª And I might have gone

22:07.587 --> 22:13.680
â™ª On my way empty-hearted â™ª

22:13.723 --> 22:15.986
What are you doing?

22:16.030 --> 22:18.902
It's a, a message for the kids.

22:20.469 --> 22:21.470
You're drunk.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.167
You said you'd thrown that away.

22:23.211 --> 22:26.301
- Well, I bought it again.
- How, how would you feel?

22:26.345 --> 22:29.391
- It's just a stupid song.
- No.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.916
No, being compared to,
to Gary Cooper.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.310
He's dead, Roald.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.746
And e-- even if he wasn't,

22:36.790 --> 22:38.792
he wouldn't be stumbling around

22:38.835 --> 22:41.142
with a can of weed-killer
trying to

22:41.185 --> 22:42.883
keep our kids happy,
would he?

22:42.926 --> 22:46.277
No, because Cooper
wouldn't leave his wife.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.240
You're an idiot.

22:52.283 --> 22:55.069
What-- what was that?
Was that, was that an apology?

22:55.112 --> 22:56.375
The best you're gonna get.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.378
[laughs]
Well, well, I'll take it.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.336
[laughing]

23:04.513 --> 23:05.514
- What?
- Here, help.

23:05.558 --> 23:06.559
Where have you gone?

23:06.602 --> 23:07.603
Here, help me. Come here.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.170
Come here. Come here.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.520
Wait, wait.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.609
[instrumental music]

23:15.524 --> 23:17.744
Mummy! Daddy! Wake up!

23:17.787 --> 23:19.485
Floffalwaffle came.
There are fairies!

23:19.528 --> 23:20.921
There really are!

23:20.964 --> 23:23.271
Mummy, wake up!

23:23.314 --> 23:24.794
We need to go.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.808
Mm.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.636
Where is Olivia?

23:42.464 --> 23:44.858
Livvy?

23:44.901 --> 23:46.425
Sweetie?

23:47.817 --> 23:49.079
Livvy?

23:55.042 --> 23:57.348
And then about 2 o'clock
in the morning, you see,

23:57.392 --> 23:59.699
the owls arrive every day.

23:59.742 --> 24:02.266
- Owls?
- Yes.

24:02.310 --> 24:05.008
Especially trained
to make chocolate.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.402
That's so clever, daddy.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.231
Tessa: No, it's not.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.407
What would you know?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.801
I know owls eat slugs,

24:14.844 --> 24:17.760
and nobody wants chocolate
made by owls,

24:17.804 --> 24:21.068
all covered in yucky slug slime.

24:21.111 --> 24:25.246
[chuckles] Well, there were
all sorts of bugs in Peach.

24:25.289 --> 24:26.900
And no one bought it.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.468
Mummy said.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.212
Go to bed.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.867
- That's not fair.
- I said go to bed.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.094
Everyone will read
this one, daddy.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.582
You need to sleep now, Livvy.

24:58.192 --> 25:01.456
- I'm not tired.
- Mummy's right.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.808
Anyway, ta-da.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.419
You said real animals.

25:08.463 --> 25:11.684
It is a real animal. It's a...

25:11.727 --> 25:13.250
It's a jubblephlum.

25:14.730 --> 25:17.298
Daddy.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.952
Go to sleep, darling.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.346
Night-night.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.700
Te amo,little one.

Roald?

26:46.909 --> 26:49.433
They think it might be
encephalitis.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.087
I don't understand.
It's just measles.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.480
Measles doesn't cause
swelling of the brain.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.656
In-- in-- in rare cases.

27:28.734 --> 27:32.215
Sorry. If you wouldn't mind...

27:32.259 --> 27:35.131
I collect them.
Autographs, I mean.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.598
She'll, uh, sleep now.

28:07.642 --> 28:10.732
No need for both of you to stay.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.429
No, you go.

28:12.473 --> 28:16.042
Tessa and Theo will be...
Well, they need you.

30:52.676 --> 30:53.895

30:53.939 --> 30:55.418
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.770
Pat, if you need anything,

30:59.814 --> 31:01.860
if you ever need me
to look after the children,

31:01.903 --> 31:05.428
or, well, well, anything,
anything...

31:05.472 --> 31:06.821
Thank you.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.781
Sorry.

31:10.825 --> 31:13.784
I'm so sorry to hear about
dear little Olivia.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.874
- Egg and cress. Excuse me.
- Oh.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.227
Pat.

31:22.793 --> 31:26.145
We've run out of egg and cress.

No, no, no, she's not.

- Olivia's.
- Please don't.

32:14.671 --> 32:17.413
Damn it, Roald,
her-- her name is Olivia.

32:17.457 --> 32:20.982
We're not even allowed
to say her name now?

- It hurts us all.

just because--

34:56.268 --> 34:58.400
It's not for her!

34:58.444 --> 35:01.273
It's for Matilda.
For my dolly.

but she is!

Oh. Come on.

two daughters?

You look cozy.

You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking about the circus.

36:55.169 --> 36:56.649
Remember the circus?

36:59.260 --> 37:01.349
You do, don't you?

37:01.393 --> 37:05.223
You remember what you said
after we came out?

37:06.963 --> 37:10.576
What you said about
the lions being your favorite?

37:12.099 --> 37:15.668
That was her.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.366
No, no, it was you, darling.
She liked the--

37:18.410 --> 37:21.151
No. It was her.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.328
And then you said
you liked them best too

37:23.371 --> 37:26.287

liked what she liked.

about everything!

They're going, and they're not
coming back! Ever!

wanted to say,

40:24.160 --> 40:25.858
about your daughter...

40:28.948 --> 40:30.732
Sorry. You had...

40:30.776 --> 40:33.126
You've got two, haven't you?

40:33.169 --> 40:36.521
I-- I do. I have. I have two.

40:36.564 --> 40:40.002
Tessa and, and Olivia.

40:40.046 --> 40:44.485
Olivia is, is her name.
That's-- that's her name.

40:44.529 --> 40:45.834
It's Olivia.

40:47.836 --> 40:51.536
I'm-- I'm sorry. My-- my husband
won't let us say her name, so...

40:51.579 --> 40:54.016
Well, that's stupid.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.497
Yes, it is stupid, isn't it?

40:57.585 --> 41:01.023
It's, uh, it's very stupid.

41:11.207 --> 41:13.427
I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.560
We're all going a
little mad in here.

41:44.023 --> 41:47.287
Butter beans.
I have a hankering for them.

41:47.330 --> 41:49.637
- Nothing's gonna grow now.
- No?

41:52.858 --> 41:55.556
- What are we gonna do?
- Well...

41:55.600 --> 41:57.166
[sighs]
Get some tinned ones.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.646
No, not about the damn
butter beans.

41:58.690 --> 42:00.126
Do about us?

42:02.650 --> 42:05.218
- Or don't you care?
- That's not fair.

42:05.261 --> 42:06.872
What's fair got to do with it?

42:06.915 --> 42:08.961
I-- I think about Livvy
every single day.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.919
- Please.
- No, our daughter has a name.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.747
And I am gonna use it.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.836
Even the postman thinks
it's stupid.

42:18.405 --> 42:19.754
I am trying.

42:22.278 --> 42:24.498
Well, try harder.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.108
How do you think it is for me,

42:26.152 --> 42:27.588
with two children scrabbling
around my--

42:27.632 --> 42:29.068
Oh, you want some
help with the kids?

42:29.111 --> 42:31.723
- Well, that would be a start.
- Ah.

42:31.766 --> 42:33.333
Fine. Alright.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.947
[instrumental music]

43:00.099 --> 43:03.493
Where's mummy?

43:03.537 --> 43:06.584
Um, gone for a walk.

43:09.674 --> 43:11.501
Breakfast?

43:11.545 --> 43:13.939
[instrumental music]

43:55.067 --> 43:57.243
Uh, just do it,
do it quite gently.

44:08.254 --> 44:10.648
[instrumental music]

44:35.498 --> 44:36.891
[dog barking]

44:38.110 --> 44:40.373
Come on! We need to go.

44:40.416 --> 44:43.550
Roald? Tessa!

44:43.593 --> 44:45.465
- Tessa, mummy's back.
- Theo.

44:45.508 --> 44:47.989
Here. Oh, my God.

44:48.033 --> 44:51.558
- Come on.
- Help, mummy! Mummy!

44:57.259 --> 45:01.699
Roald? Roald? Roald!

45:04.571 --> 45:07.400
Roald, what in the actual
hell were you thinking?

45:07.443 --> 45:11.143
You answer me. Answer me!

45:11.186 --> 45:13.493
You answer me.

45:13.536 --> 45:17.192
What the hell? You answer me.

45:17.236 --> 45:19.760
- Leave me alone.
- What is the matter with you?

45:19.804 --> 45:22.458
What is the,
what is the matter with you?

45:25.331 --> 45:28.290
What is the matter with you?

45:28.334 --> 45:30.728
[indistinct chatter]

45:35.907 --> 45:38.344
[panting]

45:48.310 --> 45:50.922
You fix things, Roald.

45:50.965 --> 45:53.533
That's what you do.

45:53.576 --> 45:56.536
Now, when,
when Theo had his accident,

45:56.579 --> 46:01.062
you buzzed around
until you fixed it.

46:01.106 --> 46:03.412
And I loved you for it.
I did.

46:05.327 --> 46:08.983
But I can't,
I can't do it anymore.

46:12.117 --> 46:15.294
You have to fix it, Roald.
You have to fix it.

46:16.512 --> 46:19.733
Before it's so broken

46:19.777 --> 46:21.953
that it can't be fixed anymore.

46:36.750 --> 46:39.144
[instrumental music]

46:48.153 --> 46:49.676
[thunder rumbling]

46:51.983 --> 46:54.333
[instrumental music]

47:03.603 --> 47:06.388
[instrumental music]

47:33.502 --> 47:36.418
[music continues]

47:47.734 --> 47:49.170
It's crazy to think your

47:49.214 --> 47:51.869
old headmaster crowned
the Queen of England.

47:51.912 --> 47:53.131
Married her too.

47:54.567 --> 47:57.483
- Good to see you again, boss.
-Hm.

47:58.788 --> 48:00.921
[sighing]

48:00.965 --> 48:03.054
Spark's gone out of you,
hasn't it, Dahl?

48:04.751 --> 48:08.494
Completely understandable
in the circumstances.

48:08.537 --> 48:11.584
And you must be Mrs. Dahl.

48:11.627 --> 48:15.240
- My sincerest condolences.
- Thank you.

48:15.283 --> 48:17.764
Please call me Pat, Your Grace.

48:20.158 --> 48:21.899
I understand you're an actress.

48:21.942 --> 48:23.248
Yes, that's right.

48:23.291 --> 48:26.512
My, my. Well, there you are.

48:30.298 --> 48:34.041
Thank you for taking this time
to see us.

48:34.085 --> 48:36.783
Not at all. Of course.

48:36.826 --> 48:39.438
Anything to help.

48:39.481 --> 48:42.006
This has been very difficult
for Pat. Uh...

48:43.964 --> 48:46.619
- Well, for both of us.
- Yes.

48:46.662 --> 48:50.492
But the fairer sex always

48:50.536 --> 48:53.234
feels the loss of a child
more deeply.

48:53.278 --> 48:55.019
Yes, Roald has been
weathering all of this

48:55.062 --> 48:56.846
so much better than I have.

48:56.890 --> 48:59.675
At least I haven't been asking
the postman for his opinion.

48:59.719 --> 49:01.416
You don't mind if I...

49:01.460 --> 49:02.635
Actually, I do.

49:16.040 --> 49:16.954
So...

49:18.520 --> 49:22.046
- Two daughters?
- Mm-hm. A-- and a son.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.570
Olivia, and Tessa and Theo.

49:26.354 --> 49:29.401
You can imagine how this has
left us all.

49:29.444 --> 49:32.143
Bereft.

49:32.186 --> 49:36.843
Yes, he can be a right old sod
at times, can't he?

49:36.886 --> 49:37.844
Who?

49:40.368 --> 49:42.501
- God.
- God?

49:44.633 --> 49:47.810
You, you told us that
once at school.

49:47.854 --> 49:50.422
Me? Absolutely not.

49:52.511 --> 49:56.428
- I'm probably mistaken.
- Most definitely.

50:06.786 --> 50:09.006
Anyway...

50:09.049 --> 50:14.837
you must take comfort from the
fact that your little, um...

50:14.881 --> 50:18.450
- Olivia.
- Olivia. Yes, yes.

50:18.493 --> 50:24.325
Olivia is blissfully happy
in the kingdom of our Lord.

50:24.369 --> 50:28.895
The way I like to look at heaven
is to imagine

50:28.938 --> 50:31.376
where she was happiest on Earth

50:31.419 --> 50:35.989
and then multiply it
a thousandfold.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.469
Well, that's the garden,
isn't it? She was always

50:37.512 --> 50:39.340
happiest in the garden,
wasn't she, Roald?

50:39.384 --> 50:41.255
W-- with her animals.

50:41.299 --> 50:46.043
Then that's where she is now.
In God's garden.

50:46.086 --> 50:48.610
The most wonderful garden
imaginable.

50:48.654 --> 50:50.221
Without the animals, of course.

50:50.264 --> 50:54.355
- But beautiful. Full of ripe--
- I-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

50:54.399 --> 50:56.792
Excuse me. Wha-- what do you
mean without the animals?

50:56.836 --> 50:58.664
Not allowed.

50:58.707 --> 51:02.798
Animals have their own
afterlife.

51:02.842 --> 51:04.322
[chuckling]

51:04.365 --> 51:05.366
[Patricia clearing throat]

51:06.715 --> 51:08.282
You are joking?

51:08.326 --> 51:10.328
It's hardly a joking matter.

51:10.371 --> 51:12.547
But then she wouldn't be happy.

51:12.591 --> 51:15.985
Sorry.
Not me who makes the rules.

51:16.029 --> 51:18.075
N-- no, not without Trilby. No.

51:18.118 --> 51:19.685
- Not without Rowley.
- No.

51:21.730 --> 51:23.080
The-- the rabbit and the dog.

51:25.212 --> 51:29.695
Definitely no dogs allowed.

51:33.046 --> 51:38.617
No. Rowley needs to be running
through the garden with her.

51:38.660 --> 51:42.838
Both of them running
with the sun on their backs.

51:42.882 --> 51:45.928
So she's not so alone.

51:45.972 --> 51:48.888
- No.
- No dogs allowed?

51:48.931 --> 51:53.980
Christ! What sort of miserable
bloody God doesn't like dogs?

51:58.289 --> 52:02.336
Roald: Sorry. Forgot what a
pompous arse he was.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.033
Patricia: No dogs in heaven.

52:04.077 --> 52:06.993
[both chuckling]

52:08.995 --> 52:11.911
[both laughing]

52:17.743 --> 52:21.225
Roald: [sobbing] Oh, Livvy.

52:21.268 --> 52:23.444
Livvy!

52:23.488 --> 52:24.445
Livvy!

52:26.839 --> 52:28.971
That's right.

52:29.015 --> 52:31.670
- That's right. Our Livvy.
- Oh, God.

52:31.713 --> 52:35.804
- Say it. Say it.
- Olivia!

52:35.848 --> 52:38.764
[dramatic music]

52:40.287 --> 52:41.810
Patricia: Thank you.

52:41.854 --> 52:42.811
[Roald sobbing]

52:44.204 --> 52:45.162
[clanking]

52:55.433 --> 52:57.783
Hello, Trilby. Hi, Trilby.

53:13.015 --> 53:13.973
Matilda.

53:15.714 --> 53:17.019
She's mine again?

53:18.630 --> 53:19.979
She always was.

53:24.418 --> 53:28.335
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy's sorry?

53:28.379 --> 53:29.380
Yes.

53:31.033 --> 53:34.820
And sorry for shouting about
the birds too.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.128
Sorry a second time?

53:39.172 --> 53:41.522
Do you forgive me?

53:41.566 --> 53:45.744
Yes. And I'm sorry
a second time too.

53:45.787 --> 53:47.702
I wish I hadn't let them go.

53:51.315 --> 53:53.752
I was just thinking...

53:53.795 --> 53:57.103
perhaps we could
wander down to the village

53:57.146 --> 53:59.497
and buy some chocolate?

54:01.194 --> 54:02.456
Both together?

54:04.328 --> 54:05.285
If you'd like.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.986
Tessa: It's a silly name.

54:11.030 --> 54:14.294
Roald: Well, no sillier than
Rock Hudson or Maurice Teapot.

54:14.338 --> 54:16.078
Tessa: No one's Maurice Teapot.

54:16.122 --> 54:17.645
Roald: Well, I'll have you know
that Maurice Teapot

54:17.689 --> 54:19.343
happens to be a very good
friend of mine.

54:19.386 --> 54:21.823
Sells carpets in Llandudno.

54:21.867 --> 54:24.913
Have you still got the owls
who make chocolate?

54:24.957 --> 54:26.785
Oh, yes, you didn't like them,
did you?

54:26.828 --> 54:28.613
No. They're too slimy.

54:28.656 --> 54:31.137
Well, it's just as well
that daddy's the writer, eh?

54:33.270 --> 54:36.838
I can't unthink what I thinked.

54:36.882 --> 54:38.405
But you're a child.

54:38.449 --> 54:40.712
So isn't it a children's story,
then?

54:45.412 --> 54:46.935
[door opening]

54:46.979 --> 54:48.459
- Hello.
- Morning.

54:55.335 --> 54:56.902
Two gobstoppers, please.

54:57.685 --> 54:59.383
Woman 1: Right.

54:59.426 --> 55:00.819
One never lasts long enough.

55:04.779 --> 55:05.824
That's very true.

55:05.867 --> 55:08.783
[instrumental music]

55:35.897 --> 55:38.813
[music continues]

55:48.127 --> 55:49.694
Roald: What's that?

55:49.737 --> 55:51.652
It's just something Marty Ritt's
directing.

55:53.524 --> 55:55.308
Not thinking of doing it,
are you?

55:55.352 --> 55:56.744
Well, perhaps.

55:58.964 --> 56:00.357
Not too soon?

56:01.923 --> 56:04.099
Well, you're working.

56:04.143 --> 56:08.321
Me working doesn't mean
leaving the kids, does it?

56:08.365 --> 56:10.018
No, I suppose not.

56:11.759 --> 56:14.588
No, but look, if you really
think you're ready,

56:14.632 --> 56:15.981
then we'll deal with it.

56:18.113 --> 56:19.114
Like we always do.

56:19.158 --> 56:22.074
[instrumental music]

56:49.188 --> 56:52.104
[music continues]

57:19.218 --> 57:22.134
[music continues]

57:41.109 --> 57:43.024
[dog barking]

58:10.965 --> 58:12.489
You want me to read it now?

58:14.665 --> 58:18.059
[chuckling] Well, of course now.

58:54.574 --> 58:55.532
Darling.

58:59.013 --> 58:59.971
Do you like it?

59:00.754 --> 59:01.712
Like it?

59:03.061 --> 59:04.453
I love it.

59:07.500 --> 59:10.677
I absolutely love it.

59:10.721 --> 59:13.724
- I was getting so nervous.
- It's brilliant.

59:13.767 --> 59:15.595
It's funny and-- and twisted.

59:15.639 --> 59:17.597
- Twisted?
- In-- in a good way.

59:17.641 --> 59:21.601
It's-- it's twisted and original
like only Roald Dahl can be.

59:21.645 --> 59:24.386
- You're not just saying that?
- No, no, no. Really.

59:24.430 --> 59:26.258
It's-- it's really,
really wonderful.

59:26.301 --> 59:29.130
Well, good. A-- any notes,
how-- however small?

59:29.174 --> 59:30.610
Because I-- I want it
to be right.

59:30.654 --> 59:32.743
- Well...
- I know. I know. Too many kids.

59:32.786 --> 59:35.615
- I thought nine was too many...
- No, I think seven is perfect.

59:35.659 --> 59:37.748
No, well, i-- instinctively I--

59:37.791 --> 59:40.315
I-- I think that seven
is still too many.

59:40.359 --> 59:41.708
I think there should be fewer,

59:41.752 --> 59:42.927
but I just don't know
which one to lose.

59:42.970 --> 59:44.624
- Oh, perhaps...
- Go-- go on, say.

59:44.668 --> 59:46.800
I-- I won't take offence.
Because this one's got to sell.

59:46.844 --> 59:48.062
- Of course.
- I know what you're thinking.

59:48.106 --> 59:50.369
The bills are piling up
and-- and...

59:50.412 --> 59:52.371
Yeah, this can't be another
stinker like "Peach."

59:52.414 --> 59:54.503
W-- when did I say "Peach"
was a stinker?

59:54.547 --> 59:57.115
Well, not in so many words, but
sometimes it's what's not said

59:57.158 --> 59:58.725
that's more important.

59:58.769 --> 1:00:02.773
"Say, Roald, how many copies of
"Peach" did you sell?"

1:00:02.816 --> 1:00:04.775
Two thousand six-hundred
and thirty-three.

1:00:06.690 --> 1:00:08.039
Please don't do this
to yourself.

1:00:08.082 --> 1:00:11.129
Oh, God, what was I thinking?

1:00:11.172 --> 1:00:14.219
Roald, kids are gonna love this.

1:00:14.262 --> 1:00:15.829
Kids? What have kids got to
do with it?

1:00:15.873 --> 1:00:19.528
It's-- it's... it's not kids
who buy kids' books.

1:00:19.572 --> 1:00:23.271
It's-- it's adults. It's parents
buying for their children.

1:00:23.315 --> 1:00:24.969
And parents don't want twisted.

1:00:25.012 --> 1:00:27.275
Roald, you are getting yourself
in a state over nothing.

1:00:27.319 --> 1:00:28.929
Nothing? Oh, no, no...
No, you're right.

1:00:28.973 --> 1:00:30.496
This is-- this is nothing.
This is just a...

1:00:30.539 --> 1:00:32.672
just a bunch of
meaningless scribbles.

1:00:32.716 --> 1:00:35.327
Do you know what we do with a
bunch of scribbles? We do this.

1:00:35.370 --> 1:00:38.069
Stop it, Roald! No! No!

1:00:38.112 --> 1:00:39.766
Roald, stop it!

1:00:39.810 --> 1:00:42.464
No, Roald! Roald, stop it!

1:00:42.508 --> 1:00:43.640
- Stop it!
- I'm done.

1:00:46.817 --> 1:00:50.211
Christ! You are a...
you're like a petulant child!

1:00:50.255 --> 1:00:51.691
Didn't you say when I stopped
was the day

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:53.911
you'd file for divorce?

1:00:53.954 --> 1:00:55.434
Don't tempt me!

1:01:00.308 --> 1:01:03.224
[engine whirring]

1:01:11.537 --> 1:01:12.494
[door closing]

1:01:25.551 --> 1:01:27.596
Oh! [gasps]

1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:30.425
[laughing] My God. Marty!

1:01:30.469 --> 1:01:31.600
- What are you...
- Finding you.

1:01:31.644 --> 1:01:33.385
[laughing]

1:01:33.428 --> 1:01:35.126
So this is where you ended up,
huh?

1:01:35.169 --> 1:01:37.432
Oh, Marty, what on earth are you
doing here?

1:01:37.476 --> 1:01:39.217
- Just passing.
- Through Buckinghamshire?

1:01:39.260 --> 1:01:41.001
Oh, so that's where I am.

1:01:41.045 --> 1:01:44.701
[laughing] Come on, sit down.
I'll make you a cup of tea.

1:01:47.747 --> 1:01:48.705
Roald around?

1:01:49.793 --> 1:01:52.360
Ah... somewhere.

1:01:52.404 --> 1:01:55.755
I can't begin to imagine what...

1:01:55.799 --> 1:01:57.670
what you two have been through.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:59.106
- Don't.
- Of course.

1:02:05.504 --> 1:02:07.898
Anyway, I hear you like
the script.

1:02:07.941 --> 1:02:09.726
Oh, I do. I love it.

1:02:09.769 --> 1:02:11.815
It's one of the best things
I've ever read.

1:02:11.858 --> 1:02:13.251
Thought you might say that.

1:02:13.294 --> 1:02:16.297
So who do you think
should play Alma?

1:02:16.341 --> 1:02:18.517
There's Shirley MacLaine.

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:20.780
Not got the mileage.

1:02:20.824 --> 1:02:23.914
- Bancroft?
- Bancroft as a housekeeper.

1:02:23.957 --> 1:02:26.351
- You kidding me?
- Shelley would be good.

1:02:26.394 --> 1:02:28.179
She might not have
the right sex appeal.

1:02:28.222 --> 1:02:29.180
[chuckling] Marty.

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:33.575
I, I-- I am flattered. I am.

1:02:33.619 --> 1:02:36.361
Tell me you don't know
how to play Alma.

1:02:36.404 --> 1:02:37.971
Of course I know how to
play Alma.

1:02:38.015 --> 1:02:39.886
Tell me you don't wanna
play Alma.

1:02:41.845 --> 1:02:43.760
Come on, Pat.

1:02:43.803 --> 1:02:47.154
You're the only one
I can see doing it. And Paul.

1:02:47.198 --> 1:02:48.852
You're the only one
he can see too.

1:02:48.895 --> 1:02:53.508
And you know what these big shot
Hollywood stars are like.

1:02:53.552 --> 1:02:54.945
Seriously?

1:02:54.988 --> 1:02:57.425
Pat, I'm sitting at your
kitchen table

1:02:57.469 --> 1:03:00.080
in the middle of
Buckinghamshire.

1:03:00.124 --> 1:03:01.516
How much more serious
do you want me to get?

1:03:03.214 --> 1:03:04.824
[sighing] I don't know.

1:03:04.868 --> 1:03:07.131
You know, we-- we're,
we're getting there, but...

1:03:07.174 --> 1:03:09.046
But what?

1:03:09.089 --> 1:03:10.525
Well, there's the kids,
for a start.

1:03:10.569 --> 1:03:13.659
Bring them with you.
I know a great nanny.

1:03:13.702 --> 1:03:16.096
Well, that's a lie.
But the studio will help...

1:03:16.140 --> 1:03:17.837
Marty! Marty! Marty!

1:03:17.881 --> 1:03:19.621
If only it were a few months
down the line.

1:03:19.665 --> 1:03:22.842
You didn't tell me
we had a visitor.

1:03:22.886 --> 1:03:26.454
Roald, you remember Marty?

1:03:26.498 --> 1:03:28.108
In the neighborhood,
were you, Marty?

1:03:31.285 --> 1:03:35.986
No. I came to persuade Pat
to be in my picture.

1:03:36.029 --> 1:03:38.249
Oh, yes, "Hud Bannon."

1:03:38.292 --> 1:03:40.207
[chuckling] It's a bloody
awful title.

1:03:40.251 --> 1:03:41.469
You're gonna have to
change that.

1:03:41.513 --> 1:03:44.646
Already have.
It's just Hud now.

1:03:44.690 --> 1:03:48.085
So you see Pat as a housekeeper,
do you?

1:03:48.128 --> 1:03:49.651
Oh, you read it, huh?

1:03:49.695 --> 1:03:52.045
- I skimmed through.
- What do you think?

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:56.615
I think LA's a long way to go
for 20 pages.

1:03:56.658 --> 1:04:00.140
Well, you know the saying,
quality, not quantity.

1:04:00.184 --> 1:04:03.361
You didn't start out
as an agent, did you, Marty?

1:04:03.404 --> 1:04:05.058
Oh, now you're getting nasty.

1:04:05.102 --> 1:04:08.148
Trust me,
you haven't seen nasty yet.

1:04:08.192 --> 1:04:12.457
Oh. I work in Hollywood.
Trust me, I have.

1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.328
[chuckling]

1:04:14.372 --> 1:04:16.765
Yes, well, no,
I-- I commend you.

1:04:16.809 --> 1:04:19.203
Roald...

1:04:19.246 --> 1:04:21.814
I certainly wouldn't have the
gall to traipse all this way

1:04:21.858 --> 1:04:25.383
to offer Pat something
that's so...

1:04:25.426 --> 1:04:26.863
shit, what's the word?

1:04:28.647 --> 1:04:30.344
Beneath her.

1:04:30.388 --> 1:04:31.345
That's two words.

1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:33.913
That's enough, Roald.

1:04:33.957 --> 1:04:36.263
The man asked my opinion,
darling.

1:04:36.307 --> 1:04:37.830
That's right.

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:41.181
And opinions are important.
So here's mine.

1:04:43.096 --> 1:04:44.663
I've been here for you
every step of the way

1:04:44.706 --> 1:04:46.360
since Livvy died, and you,

1:04:46.404 --> 1:04:49.276
and you haven't been here
for me once.

1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:52.410
Something has to change,
and I am gonna change it,

1:04:52.453 --> 1:04:55.587
because, let's face it,
you never will.

1:04:55.630 --> 1:04:58.895
You're too consumed with your
goddamn self-pity.

1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:03.247
So you stay here, Roald,
and you wallow.

1:05:03.290 --> 1:05:06.467
You, you bark at the world,
for all I care.

1:05:10.254 --> 1:05:11.211
Marty...

1:05:12.430 --> 1:05:13.387
Thank you.

1:05:14.388 --> 1:05:15.694
I'm all yours.

1:05:21.743 --> 1:05:23.267
Congratulations, Marty.

1:05:25.747 --> 1:05:27.880
I'm glad it hasn't been
a wasted trip.

1:05:33.277 --> 1:05:34.408
Pat, you're being ridiculous.

1:05:34.452 --> 1:05:36.149
You're not ready
and you know it.

1:05:36.193 --> 1:05:40.414
Oh, mighty Roald. You know me so
much better than I know myself.

1:05:40.458 --> 1:05:42.982
Fine. Take the first bit part
that comes along.

1:05:43.026 --> 1:05:45.680
- It is not a bit part.
- It's 20 bloody pages.

1:05:45.724 --> 1:05:47.291
They won't even notice
you're not there.

1:05:50.424 --> 1:05:51.382
Thank you.

1:05:53.210 --> 1:05:54.820
What for?

1:05:54.863 --> 1:05:59.303
For making it so goddamn easy
to go.

1:05:59.346 --> 1:06:03.568
Alright. Alright, fine. I...
[chuckling] I'm sorry, okay?

1:06:03.611 --> 1:06:08.007
I-- I was an arse. I'll call
Marty up. I'll-- I'll apologize.

1:06:08.051 --> 1:06:11.271
I just think
it isn't the right time.

1:06:11.315 --> 1:06:13.143
Will there ever be
the right time?

1:06:19.410 --> 1:06:22.413
Perhaps we both need some space.

1:06:22.456 --> 1:06:25.242
Space? Why do we need space?

1:06:25.285 --> 1:06:26.634
To think.

1:06:29.898 --> 1:06:31.291
What's there to think about?

1:06:41.432 --> 1:06:45.610
Now-- now, look, Pat,
I, I can change.

1:06:45.653 --> 1:06:46.611
I can.

1:06:49.266 --> 1:06:50.223
Yeah.

1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:54.401
People always say that
at the end.

1:06:54.445 --> 1:06:57.361
[instrumental music]

1:07:24.475 --> 1:07:27.391
[music continues]

1:07:54.766 --> 1:07:57.725
[music continues]

1:07:57.769 --> 1:07:58.726
[door opening]

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:24.056
[electricity crackling]

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.778
Roald: Awful drive.

1:08:50.822 --> 1:08:55.000
Lorries kept holding us up
on narrow roads.

1:08:55.042 --> 1:08:57.959
Got to hospital. Ambulance went
to wrong entrance.

1:09:00.265 --> 1:09:02.050
I kissed her.

1:09:02.094 --> 1:09:03.050
She was warm.

1:09:05.228 --> 1:09:07.881
"Why is she so warm?"

1:09:07.925 --> 1:09:10.710
"Of course," he said. I left.

1:09:19.416 --> 1:09:21.157
We all become stories
in the end.

1:09:24.334 --> 1:09:26.901
So don't you think she'd like to
be remembered with a happy one?

1:09:35.693 --> 1:09:38.609
[instrumental music]

1:09:46.660 --> 1:09:48.314
Are you glad we came?

1:09:48.358 --> 1:09:50.011
It's pretty.

1:09:50.055 --> 1:09:52.797
You know,
I've always felt at home here.

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:55.365
What about daddy?

1:09:55.407 --> 1:09:57.323
Daddy not so much.

1:09:57.367 --> 1:10:00.282
Does that mean he won't come?

1:10:00.326 --> 1:10:02.937
Would you like him to come?

1:10:02.981 --> 1:10:04.764
I don't want him lonely.

1:10:13.296 --> 1:10:16.212
[dog barking]

1:10:23.827 --> 1:10:26.744
[music continues]

1:10:53.858 --> 1:10:56.773
[music continues]

1:10:59.603 --> 1:11:02.519
[birds chirping]

1:11:06.610 --> 1:11:09.526
[birds chirping]

1:11:23.888 --> 1:11:26.804
[music continues]

1:11:48.652 --> 1:11:49.914
So, you're worried?

1:11:51.829 --> 1:11:53.439
Not so much worried.

1:11:53.483 --> 1:11:55.353
Worried's what goes on in here.

1:11:55.398 --> 1:11:58.357
It's... well, it's more here
I'm all aflutter.

1:11:58.401 --> 1:12:00.359
And what about down here?

1:12:00.403 --> 1:12:02.013
What does my gut tell me?

1:12:02.056 --> 1:12:03.580
It's what I always listen to.

1:12:06.583 --> 1:12:08.759
You know,
I can't say I wasn't surprised

1:12:08.802 --> 1:12:11.327
when I heard
you were playing Alma.

1:12:11.370 --> 1:12:12.632
I know.

1:12:12.675 --> 1:12:14.373
But I think I know her.

1:12:14.416 --> 1:12:16.157
Well, at least I thought I did.

1:12:16.201 --> 1:12:18.725
- And now you don't?
- Maybe.

1:12:20.901 --> 1:12:22.642
I-I...

1:12:22.686 --> 1:12:25.471
I don't know. Maybe I agreed to
do this for the wrong reasons.

1:12:25.514 --> 1:12:27.952
Get out of your head.

1:12:27.995 --> 1:12:30.084
Thinking like that'll
be the end of us all.

1:12:30.128 --> 1:12:32.522
That's easier said than done.

1:12:32.565 --> 1:12:34.132
And Paul wants to meet me
tomorrow

1:12:34.175 --> 1:12:36.656
to go through it with Marty.

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:39.050
I'm worried he's gonna see
right through me.

1:12:39.093 --> 1:12:40.921
You know, these leading men...

1:12:42.053 --> 1:12:43.880
only see themselves.

1:12:43.924 --> 1:12:46.797
[both laughing]

1:13:02.378 --> 1:13:03.553
Mommy's home!

1:13:08.209 --> 1:13:09.166
[door opening]

1:13:10.124 --> 1:13:11.082
Hello?

1:13:16.782 --> 1:13:19.830
Well, what are you doing?

1:13:19.873 --> 1:13:22.572
Shh. We're hunting a bear.

1:13:22.615 --> 1:13:25.749
Oh! Well, that sounds terribly
dangerous.

1:13:25.791 --> 1:13:26.967
It's over there.

1:13:36.237 --> 1:13:37.237
Arrraaah!

1:13:37.282 --> 1:13:38.762
[Patricia gasping]

1:13:38.805 --> 1:13:39.850
[Roald grunting]

1:13:39.893 --> 1:13:40.894
What're you doing?!

1:13:40.938 --> 1:13:43.070
[both laughing]

1:13:43.114 --> 1:13:44.855
Tessa: No, no, no!
Roald: Oh, no, no! Wait!

1:13:44.898 --> 1:13:47.727
Wait, wait. No we've,
we've frightened mummy.

1:13:47.771 --> 1:13:49.294
What are you doing here?

1:13:49.337 --> 1:13:52.340
Well, I'm a bear.
I've been attacking her village.

1:13:52.384 --> 1:13:54.255
And she's an Apache brave
who's hunting me.

1:13:54.299 --> 1:13:55.474
[Tessa grunting]

1:13:55.518 --> 1:13:57.824
Tessa, go and play in your
bedroom.

1:13:57.868 --> 1:14:01.567
But I haven't killed the bear.

1:14:01.611 --> 1:14:04.352
Well, you can...
you can kill me later.

1:14:04.396 --> 1:14:06.005
[Roald sighing]

1:14:09.096 --> 1:14:11.098
Okay, but if you eat any more
villagers,

1:14:11.142 --> 1:14:12.577
I'm going to be very cross.

1:14:12.621 --> 1:14:15.014
Oh, right. Right you are.

1:14:15.059 --> 1:14:16.016
[Roald laughing]

1:14:22.501 --> 1:14:24.460
What happened to us both
wanting some space?

1:14:25.983 --> 1:14:28.289
Well, if you recall...

1:14:28.333 --> 1:14:30.291
it wasn't both of us.

1:14:44.175 --> 1:14:45.829
I'll have what you're having.

1:14:52.096 --> 1:14:54.490
I'm sorry. We've started out
all wrong, haven't we?

1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:03.977
How's the film?

1:15:04.021 --> 1:15:05.762
Couldn't be better.

1:15:05.805 --> 1:15:07.719
Well, that is good.

1:15:07.764 --> 1:15:10.723
Well, if it's all the same to
you, I'll, I'll stick around,

1:15:10.767 --> 1:15:13.073
pick up your laundry, help with
the kids, that sort of thing.

1:15:15.206 --> 1:15:18.818
You never know,
I might come in useful.

1:15:18.862 --> 1:15:19.818
Chin-chin.

1:15:33.790 --> 1:15:36.749
- Daddy?
- Yes?

1:15:36.793 --> 1:15:40.927
Would you be angry
if I'd done something?

1:15:40.971 --> 1:15:44.017
That would depend entirely
what it was you'd done.

1:15:46.672 --> 1:15:49.545
I only did it so mummy
could read it to me.

1:15:54.027 --> 1:15:56.334
You always told Livvy
your stories and not me.

1:16:01.208 --> 1:16:02.601
Are you angry?

1:16:06.779 --> 1:16:07.737
No.

1:16:08.607 --> 1:16:09.565
No.

1:16:14.134 --> 1:16:18.356
- What did you think?
- I still don't like the owls.

1:16:18.398 --> 1:16:21.489
I see. Well, anything else?

1:16:21.532 --> 1:16:27.757
Well... maybe the river could be
chocolate instead.

1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:31.456
There could be this big
marshmallow mountain.

1:16:31.499 --> 1:16:33.632
And then maybe
a butterscotch river.

1:16:33.675 --> 1:16:35.852
I like that.
That's a very good idea.

1:16:35.895 --> 1:16:37.157
[both laughing]

1:16:38.985 --> 1:16:41.161
[phone ringing]

1:16:49.213 --> 1:16:51.302
Patricia Neal for Paul Newman.

1:16:51.344 --> 1:16:53.173
- Come in.
- Thank you.

1:17:00.616 --> 1:17:02.182
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

1:17:14.499 --> 1:17:15.718
Marty: Hm.

1:17:15.761 --> 1:17:17.589
[door opening]

1:17:17.633 --> 1:17:18.982
Paul: There she is.

1:17:19.025 --> 1:17:21.941
Paul. It's so great to
see you again.

1:17:23.290 --> 1:17:24.814
Pat.

1:17:24.857 --> 1:17:27.599
Oh. Marty.

1:17:27.643 --> 1:17:29.166
Marty: We thought you might have
gotten lost.

1:17:29.209 --> 1:17:31.298
Only in this house.
It's enormous.

1:17:31.342 --> 1:17:32.691
Thrilled to have you on board,
Pat.

1:17:32.735 --> 1:17:35.999
Patricia: Oh, I'm thrilled
you wanted me.

1:17:36.041 --> 1:17:38.130
So, Pat likes the script.
Don't you, Pat?

1:17:38.175 --> 1:17:40.177
Absolutely. I adore it.

1:17:40.219 --> 1:17:41.482
Glad to hear it. Me too.

1:17:43.659 --> 1:17:45.661
Patricia: Great.

1:17:45.704 --> 1:17:47.358
So, as we were saying
earlier, Paul,

1:17:47.401 --> 1:17:48.880
I think what Pat can bring
to the part--

1:17:48.925 --> 1:17:51.231
So how come it took you so long
to say yes, then?

1:17:51.275 --> 1:17:53.581
I'm just curious, Marty, is all.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:57.803
Scripts like this don't come
along every day.

1:17:57.847 --> 1:18:00.240
- Wouldn't you agree, Pat?
- Of course.

1:18:00.284 --> 1:18:02.242
So it's natural to wonder...

1:18:03.766 --> 1:18:05.028
why all the gaming?

1:18:13.776 --> 1:18:17.344
So, how come it took you so long
to say yes?

1:18:19.346 --> 1:18:25.483
You may have heard my,
my daughter, Olivia, she...

1:18:25.526 --> 1:18:27.702
I heard.

1:18:27.746 --> 1:18:29.226
Now, what does someone
say to that?

1:18:29.269 --> 1:18:30.967
Oh, you don't need to
say anything.

1:18:34.405 --> 1:18:36.233
Shit happens, right?

1:18:37.495 --> 1:18:40.280
Yeah. Shit happens.

1:18:42.934 --> 1:18:45.764
So, I've got a crazy idea.
Let's talk about "Hud."

1:18:45.808 --> 1:18:47.287
You got a favorite scene, Pat?

1:18:49.376 --> 1:18:51.727
Favorite scene? Um...

1:18:51.770 --> 1:18:55.948
Well, there are so many of them.

1:18:55.992 --> 1:18:59.952
Well, there's the car,
and, well, the bus station.

1:18:59.996 --> 1:19:01.562
I love that scene.

1:19:01.606 --> 1:19:03.869
That's some great writing.

1:19:03.913 --> 1:19:07.916
- You off book yet?
- What? Sure.

1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:09.309
Up for throwing some
lines around?

1:19:09.353 --> 1:19:10.746
Paul, you're not being fair.

1:19:10.789 --> 1:19:12.312
You haven't given the lady
any warning.

1:19:12.356 --> 1:19:14.880
She said she's off book.

1:19:14.924 --> 1:19:16.577
Sure. No-- no,
I-- I-- I'm ready.

1:19:23.062 --> 1:19:24.020
Well...

1:19:26.109 --> 1:19:29.155
Looks like we're losing
a good cook.

1:19:29.199 --> 1:19:32.463
Maybe we should have boosted
your salary a little.

1:19:32.505 --> 1:19:33.769
You ain't letting that
little ruckus we had

1:19:33.812 --> 1:19:36.859
run you off, are you?

1:19:36.902 --> 1:19:38.643
As far as I can get on
a bus ticket.

1:19:41.646 --> 1:19:42.821
You claiming
I'm the first guy who ever

1:19:42.865 --> 1:19:44.388
stuck his foot
in your door?

1:19:44.431 --> 1:19:45.389
No.

1:19:47.391 --> 1:19:50.307
First one who ever got rough,
huh?

1:19:50.350 --> 1:19:52.352
Well, I'm sorry.

1:19:52.396 --> 1:19:54.485
That ain't my style.

1:19:54.528 --> 1:19:57.443
I don't usually get rough
with my women.

1:19:57.487 --> 1:19:59.925
I generally don't have to.

1:19:59.969 --> 1:20:02.188
- You're tough on everyone.
- Rough.

1:20:02.232 --> 1:20:04.147
What?

1:20:04.190 --> 1:20:07.628
It's "You're rough on
everybody," not "tough."

1:20:07.672 --> 1:20:09.195
The clue's in the line.

1:20:10.893 --> 1:20:13.547
Oh, okay, alright.

1:20:13.591 --> 1:20:15.332
I don't usually get rough
with my women.

1:20:15.375 --> 1:20:18.422
I generally don't have to.

1:20:18.465 --> 1:20:20.337
You're rough on everyone.

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:21.686
So they tell me.

1:20:23.818 --> 1:20:27.300
You want to know
something funny?

1:20:27.344 --> 1:20:28.475
It would have happened
eventually

1:20:28.519 --> 1:20:31.348
without the roughhouse.

1:20:31.391 --> 1:20:33.393
You look pretty good without
your shirt on, you know.

1:20:37.005 --> 1:20:40.313
You look pretty good
without your shirt on...

1:20:40.357 --> 1:20:41.314
Uh...

1:20:43.577 --> 1:20:46.666
The sight of that through
the kitchen window

1:20:46.710 --> 1:20:49.322
made me put my dishcloth
down more than once.

1:20:53.282 --> 1:20:55.546
Why didn't you say something
sooner?

1:20:55.589 --> 1:20:56.547
Well...

1:20:57.983 --> 1:21:00.202
I'll remember you, honey.

1:21:00.246 --> 1:21:01.421
You're the one that got away.

1:21:10.778 --> 1:21:12.302
Wanna, wanna go again?

1:21:15.609 --> 1:21:16.567
No.

1:21:21.702 --> 1:21:24.183
You, ah...

1:21:24.227 --> 1:21:25.445
play pool, Pat?

1:21:28.057 --> 1:21:30.973
[birds squawking]

1:21:32.975 --> 1:21:35.891
- How was your day, dear?
- Oh, just peachy.

1:21:35.934 --> 1:21:38.981
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Really not.

1:21:39.023 --> 1:21:40.764
I'm guessing
it didn't go so well.

1:21:40.808 --> 1:21:43.333
Well, that's the understatement
of the year.

1:21:43.376 --> 1:21:45.291
Probably checking on
Shelley Winters as we speak.

1:21:45.335 --> 1:21:47.554
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

1:21:47.598 --> 1:21:50.688
Unfortunately,
I can't even blame him.

1:21:50.731 --> 1:21:52.385
I thought I had her.

1:21:54.910 --> 1:21:56.215
Well, I did say.

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.523
Did say what?

1:21:59.566 --> 1:22:01.481
That Alma probably
wasn't for you.

1:22:03.092 --> 1:22:05.485
Is this you being supportive?

1:22:05.529 --> 1:22:07.443
Well, I mean, she's not
what you're known for.

1:22:07.487 --> 1:22:09.968
- Not a fox fur in sight.
- Is that supposed to be funny?

1:22:10.012 --> 1:22:12.579
Well, all I mean is she's
a complex creature.

1:22:12.623 --> 1:22:15.931
- She's not had an easy life.
- And what? I have?

1:22:15.974 --> 1:22:17.584
She's sexual, she's confident,

1:22:17.628 --> 1:22:18.846
but she's been through
the wringer.

1:22:18.889 --> 1:22:21.719
She's been used.
She's vulnerable. She...

1:22:21.762 --> 1:22:23.677
It's a lot to ask
of any actress.

1:22:23.721 --> 1:22:27.246
Screw you, Roald.
I get her. I do.

1:22:27.290 --> 1:22:30.032
Well, getting her is one thing,
playing her is quite another.

1:22:30.075 --> 1:22:31.859
I mean right now.

1:22:31.903 --> 1:22:35.210
What with Livvy and...

1:22:35.254 --> 1:22:36.212
No.

1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:41.478
Alma has known that sort of pain
her whole life.

1:22:41.521 --> 1:22:45.090
It's there on every page.
Livvy is the reason I can do it.

1:22:45.134 --> 1:22:46.526
Then what's the problem?

1:22:54.925 --> 1:22:56.493
What are you doing?

1:22:56.536 --> 1:22:57.973
Well, just stating the obvious,
darling.

1:23:02.151 --> 1:23:06.329
[laughing] You bastard.

1:23:06.371 --> 1:23:09.853
You bastard.

1:23:09.897 --> 1:23:12.117
I don't know what you're talking
about, Pat.

1:23:12.161 --> 1:23:14.598
Why didn't you just come
right out and say it?

1:23:14.641 --> 1:23:17.731
Would you have listened?

1:23:17.775 --> 1:23:19.559
You're an idiot.

1:23:30.353 --> 1:23:32.094
No.

1:23:32.137 --> 1:23:33.704
No kiss.

1:23:33.746 --> 1:23:37.055
- What? Not even a little one?
- No, that's it.

1:23:37.099 --> 1:23:38.621
Not even a little one.

1:23:38.665 --> 1:23:41.581

1:23:59.512 --> 1:24:01.384
Paul. Marty.

1:24:01.427 --> 1:24:03.559
Is everything okay?
We weren't expecting to see you.

1:24:03.603 --> 1:24:05.127
I know what was wrong.

1:24:05.170 --> 1:24:07.129
- Wrong with what?
- The bus station.

1:24:07.172 --> 1:24:09.782
Ah, we were just talking about
that. Paul and I have an idea.

1:24:09.827 --> 1:24:11.655
- We might go in a different...
- The scene is fine. It was me.

1:24:11.698 --> 1:24:13.309
- I was all wrong.
- No, Pat.

1:24:13.352 --> 1:24:14.309
Marty.

1:24:17.791 --> 1:24:18.749
Alright?

1:24:26.452 --> 1:24:29.107
Looks like we're losing
a good cook.

1:24:29.151 --> 1:24:30.848
Maybe we should have boosted
your salary a little.

1:24:35.635 --> 1:24:37.115
You ain't letting that
little ruckus we had

1:24:37.159 --> 1:24:38.550
run you off, are you?

1:24:38.594 --> 1:24:40.075
Far as I can get
on a bus ticket.

1:24:43.425 --> 1:24:44.688
You claiming I'm the first guy

1:24:44.731 --> 1:24:46.733
who ever stuck his foot
in your door?

1:24:46.777 --> 1:24:47.734
No.

1:24:50.693 --> 1:24:52.652
First one who ever got rough,
huh?

1:24:54.611 --> 1:24:57.483
Well, I'm sorry.
Ain't my style.

1:24:57.527 --> 1:25:00.398
I don't usually get rough
with my women.

1:25:00.443 --> 1:25:05.925
I... generally don't have to.

1:25:05.969 --> 1:25:07.666
You're rough on everybody.

1:25:13.891 --> 1:25:16.023
So they tell me.

1:25:16.067 --> 1:25:17.503
You want to know
something funny?

1:25:19.853 --> 1:25:21.028
It would have happened
eventually

1:25:21.072 --> 1:25:23.901

your shirt on, you know.

The sight of that through
the kitchen window

1:25:28.601 --> 1:25:30.603
made me put my dish towel
down more than once.

1:25:33.650 --> 1:25:34.955
Why didn't you say something
sooner?

1:25:36.174 --> 1:25:37.132
Well...

1:25:40.178 --> 1:25:42.005
No. No. No kiss.

1:25:42.049 --> 1:25:45.139
She just walks straight to the
bus and not even look back.

1:25:51.276 --> 1:25:52.234
Yeah.

1:25:53.409 --> 1:25:54.366
[chuckling]

1:25:56.237 --> 1:25:57.717

- Has she read it?
- Shh, shh, shh.

1:26:54.773 --> 1:26:55.732
Last page.

1:27:06.003 --> 1:27:06.960
It's alright.

1:27:08.397 --> 1:27:10.398
I know it's good this time.

1:27:10.442 --> 1:27:11.400
Do you know how good?

1:27:12.575 --> 1:27:14.620
Mmm... [chuckling]

1:27:15.969 --> 1:27:17.493
Any notes?

1:27:17.536 --> 1:27:20.626
You know, I-- I do have one.

1:27:20.670 --> 1:27:23.107
Oh.

1:27:23.150 --> 1:27:27.154
You promise you won't change
a single line?

Isn't he a clever daddy?

- Isn't he?
- Yes!

Gregory: The nominees for best
performance by an actress are,

1:27:44.433 --> 1:27:47.218
Leslie Caron,
in "The L-Shaped Room,"

1:27:47.262 --> 1:27:51.657
for her adroit study of a girl
in technical difficulty.

1:27:51.701 --> 1:27:54.312
Shirley MacLaine,
in "Irma La Douce,"

1:27:54.356 --> 1:27:58.403
who allowed us a glimpse of the
late, late show in Paris.

1:27:58.447 --> 1:28:02.973
Natalie Wood, in "Love With The
Proper Stranger," is the proof

1:28:03.016 --> 1:28:07.760
that it was a big year for girls
in technical difficulty.

1:28:07.804 --> 1:28:10.154
Patricia Neal, in "Hud,"

1:28:10.197 --> 1:28:12.764
for her portrayal
of the slovenly,

1:28:12.809 --> 1:28:14.289
affectionate housekeeper.

1:28:17.683 --> 1:28:20.338
Rachel Roberts,
in "This Sporting Life,"

1:28:20.382 --> 1:28:23.646
for her portrait of the
repressed young widow.

1:28:23.689 --> 1:28:26.170
[audience applauding]

1:28:27.344 --> 1:28:28.999
And the winner...

1:28:29.041 --> 1:28:32.263
"The King Of Breakfasts."

1:28:32.307 --> 1:28:33.786
Now, don't go into labor
or something, but...

1:28:33.830 --> 1:28:35.222
Gregory: ...Patricia Neal.

1:28:35.266 --> 1:28:38.400
...you've only gone
and won a bloody Oscar.

1:28:38.443 --> 1:28:40.358
No! No!

1:28:40.402 --> 1:28:43.927
Didn't I say you'd squeeze every
last drop out of those 20 pages.

1:28:43.969 --> 1:28:45.450
Is that what you said?

1:28:45.494 --> 1:28:47.059
Isn't mummy clever?

1:28:48.975 --> 1:28:50.585
[gasping]

1:28:50.629 --> 1:28:52.065
Isn't mummy clever?

1:28:55.504 --> 1:28:57.201
No.

1:28:57.244 --> 1:28:59.290
Tessa: Oh, my God!

1:28:59.334 --> 1:29:01.901
[all laughing]

1:29:02.902 --> 1:29:05.818
[instrumental music]

1:29:17.221 --> 1:29:19.179
Man 1: Mr. Dahl,
did you have any idea

1:29:19.223 --> 1:29:22.052
just how successful that book
was going to end up becoming?

1:29:22.094 --> 1:29:23.923
Roald: No, none whatsoever.
Never have.

1:29:23.967 --> 1:29:25.751
I just hope someone likes them.

1:29:25.795 --> 1:29:27.840
I have to say a great many
people all over the world

1:29:27.884 --> 1:29:29.407
loved "Charlie And The
Chocolate Factory"

1:29:29.451 --> 1:29:30.800
particularly.

1:29:30.843 --> 1:29:32.802
Roald: Yes,
it does seem that way.

1:29:32.844 --> 1:29:34.630
Man 1: In fact, many people
have called it

1:29:34.673 --> 1:29:37.546
one of the finest
children's books.

1:29:37.589 --> 1:29:39.286
Roald: Well,
I don't know about that,

1:29:39.330 --> 1:29:40.853
but I'm quite happy with it.

1:29:40.897 --> 1:29:43.202
Tessa: Daddy! Mummy!
Look at them!

1:29:43.246 --> 1:29:45.641
- Mummy, look! Livvy's birds!
- Roald!

1:29:45.684 --> 1:29:48.818
Patricia: Roald, come on out!
They're back!

1:29:48.861 --> 1:29:52.212
Tess: Look they're even flying!
Look!

1:29:52.255 --> 1:29:53.431
- Look at that.
- Daddy, come and look.

1:29:53.475 --> 1:29:54.476
Tess: Livvy's birds!

1:29:54.519 --> 1:29:56.434
[birds chirping]

1:30:04.050 --> 1:30:06.966
[instrumental music]

1:30:15.584 --> 1:30:18.237
Roald: Perhaps there's a part
of me that became a storyteller

1:30:18.282 --> 1:30:21.764
so I could choose
what happens next.

1:30:21.807 --> 1:30:25.811
Because, of course, real life
doesn't let you do that.

1:30:25.855 --> 1:30:30.468
Over the years I dedicated
books to all my children.

1:30:30.512 --> 1:30:34.037
To Lucy, to Ophelia, to Theo...

1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:35.038
to Tessa.

1:30:36.735 --> 1:30:38.998
And to Olivia.

1:30:41.174 --> 1:30:44.439
20th of April, 1955,

1:30:44.482 --> 1:30:48.007
to the 17th of November, 1962.

1:30:54.536 --> 1:30:57.452
[instrumental music]

1:31:24.566 --> 1:31:27.482
[music continues]

1:31:54.596 --> 1:31:57.512
[music continues]

1:32:24.626 --> 1:32:27.541
[music continues]

1:32:54.656 --> 1:32:57.572
[music continues]

1:33:24.686 --> 1:33:27.602
[music continues]

1:33:54.716 --> 1:33:57.632
[music continues]
