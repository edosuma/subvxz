That makes no sense.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.116
I rented that apartment,

00:15.183 --> 00:17.885

can afford it on our own.

00:37.971 --> 00:38.972
Sometimes.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.142
I don't want that.

You don't want us

an apartment together,

that's a signal

as boyfriend and girlfriend,

my feelings to change.

being your friend,

01:15.709 --> 01:19.147

are... Are unpredictable.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.649
So much can go wrong,
especially when I am involved.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.518
And if we live together,
it's gonna be awkward.

Your symptoms could also
be from a kidney stone

be caused by
gastric bypass surgery?

04:07.548 --> 04:08.682
It depends.

377 pounds.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.021
That's a lot.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.024

those symptoms,

06:39.166 --> 06:42.169
I canceled because
my leg is a little sore.

phlebitis

06:44.237 --> 06:45.606

Could also be
an unsurprising complication

He did
have gastric bypass.

That makes it
less impressive?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.932

Well, yeah,

to just diet and exercise.

and I'll tell him
I'm having surgery...

10:44.577 --> 10:46.079
On my bladder.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.383
Your husband doesn't know
you had gastric bypass?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.552
That would require him knowing
I was obese to begin with.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.620
That's not
gonna happen.

10:53.687 --> 10:57.090
Your husband
must be very shallow.

10:57.157 --> 11:02.462
Even if I don't disclose
that I reversed your bypass,
your scars might.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.231
It requires
a separate incision.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.199
Well, tell him
there was a complication.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.236
Our obligation to protect your
privacy doesn't include lying.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.271
And you shouldn't have to go
through this without him.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.808
The single abdominal
umbilical port.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.479
We can repair
Wade's fistula

11:19.546 --> 11:21.481
and reverse his bypass

11:21.548 --> 11:24.184
all through
a single incision.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.087
We can help
deceive your husband.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.056
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
That's okay, Spence.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.258
Got here
as soon as I could.
It's all right.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.396
And since my husband is
surrounded by surgeons,

11:36.463 --> 11:38.065
what's the issue,
what are you gonna
do about it,

11:38.131 --> 11:39.833
and how often have you
done it successfully?

11:48.508 --> 11:49.843
How are you doing?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.212
I'm fine.

one spoonful of tuna,

two ounces
of apple sauce.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.595
That's it?

12:08.661 --> 12:11.064
Mom, if that's all I had,
you'd never let me up
from the table.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.000
This is different.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.836
I can't eat
too quickly.
I don't believe you.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.805
It's true.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.773
Your mother is suffering
from severe malnutrition,

12:19.840 --> 12:21.775
and she's trying
her best...
I knew it.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.344
You're too skinny.
That's why you're here.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.846
That's probably why
your heart's messed up,

12:25.913 --> 12:27.848
and you still won't eat.
Graham, I am trying.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.083
How hard
can it be to eat?
I'm not feeling well.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.785
Me and Dad
are really worried about you.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.254
Don't you care?
Of course I do, Graham.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.322
So much.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.824
Then do something.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.958

12:47.901 --> 12:49.669
You provoked
that argument?

12:49.736 --> 12:52.372
Yep, and I may have just
saved our patient.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.541
She requested an NG tube.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.344
Understanding is nice.
Calories are better.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.482
He's screwing this up.
His husband's scared,

13:02.549 --> 13:04.184
and he just wants to know
what's going on.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.054
Nothing like marital advice
from the divorced.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.356
You're divorced, too.
And I'm not advising.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.358
I'm not judging
the health of a marriage

13:11.424 --> 13:14.327
based on a single secret,
which is neither shocking

13:14.394 --> 13:16.229
nor a sign
of its imminent demise.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.730
What, truth in a marriage
is overrated?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.466
Well, it was in mine.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.469
Not every single insight,
opinion, or impulse
needs to be shared.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.171
Marriage sounds
confusing.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.638
No wonder you both
failed at it.

No, just
a little awkward.

As for the physical therapy,
of course, he's stalling.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.438
Glassman's a proud man.
He ran this hospital.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.206
He's reluctant to feel
weak and vulnerable

14:33.273 --> 14:35.242
in front of people
who used to work for him.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.277
That doesn't
make sense.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.579
He is weak.
He just had brain surgery.

Well, sensical or not,
that's my take.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.416
He'll walk eventually.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.785
SHAUN: Every day
in the hospital

Well, you tell him that,
and maybe he'll hop
right out of bed.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.961
I did.
It didn't work.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.029
He didn't respond
to the stick.

with the stick?

Uh, Glassman, appropriately,

seen your husband's chart...

21:11.771 --> 21:13.373

felt strongly
that you should see

21:13.440 --> 21:14.807
how he responds
to medication before...

21:14.874 --> 21:16.509
Wade's care is completely
appropriate for his condition.

But if his Crohn's lesions
could be treated
without cutting him open...

21:18.811 --> 21:19.946
That's not
what we're treating.

Excuse me?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.520
Go talk

35:40.472 --> 35:42.241
He's in recovery now.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.509
I think he's awake.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.976
Thank you.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.689
Wade told me
where to find these.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.760
DR. PARK: This is him
before bypass?

36:01.827 --> 36:05.931
He said that seeing these
would help me understand
why he never told me.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.434
Which...

36:08.500 --> 36:10.436
I said
was ridiculous.

36:11.136 --> 36:13.305
**

36:21.347 --> 36:23.181
Is he gonna end up
like this again?

36:25.451 --> 36:26.785
It's possible.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.321
**

36:33.191 --> 36:34.693
(SCOFFS)

36:36.662 --> 36:38.397
I wish
I didn't know that.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.947
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

36:58.116 --> 36:59.150
Yeah?

37:03.389 --> 37:04.390
Debbie, hi.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.094
Oh, um...

37:09.160 --> 37:11.162
Shaun thought
you could use a visit.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.299
Huh.
Oh, and, uh...

37:13.365 --> 37:14.800
And another muffin.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.269
Thank you. I wish
I'd known you were coming.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.171
I would've slipped
into something
a little less comfortable.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.807
You look...good.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.642
Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, well...

37:23.709 --> 37:25.411
Unlikely,
but thank you.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.179
I am

37:28.246 --> 37:29.681
sorry that I've been

37:31.249 --> 37:32.718
out of touch.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.020
Well, I had
a brain tumor.
Mmm.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.323
Understandable.
We both dropped the ball.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.593
(SIGHS)

37:45.163 --> 37:47.466
Okay.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.134
Here we go.
What's happening?

37:49.200 --> 37:51.437
We're taking a walk.
Oh, no, no, thank you.
No, my leg hurts...

37:51.503 --> 37:52.704
Oh, yes, we are.
Yeah, mmm-hmm.
Ow, ow.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.741
Which is exactly
why you need to take a walk.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.142
**

37:57.208 --> 37:59.545
Wow. You're really good
at this.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.846
You sure you haven't
done this before?

38:00.912 --> 38:02.681
Well...

38:02.748 --> 38:05.684
I spent a little time
as a nurse.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.986
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES)

38:08.053 --> 38:09.555
I always liked
the night shift.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.190
Everything gets
really quiet.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.192
It's almost...
It's almost peaceful.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.563
**

38:31.977 --> 38:33.579
Just came
from Louisa's room.

38:34.212 --> 38:35.313
She's eating.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.483
That's great news.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.184
Yeah.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.653
Hopefully we'll be able
to do the valve repair
in a couple weeks.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.456
I hope you're right.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.693
But you won't be
a part of the surgery.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.630
Or any of my surgeries.

38:51.697 --> 38:54.232
You went around me,
directly to the patient.

38:54.299 --> 38:57.503
I had a good idea
that you didn't
take seriously.

38:57.569 --> 38:58.937
I considered it,

38:59.004 --> 39:01.072
and then I decided against
taking it to the patient.

39:01.139 --> 39:04.042
And yet, I managed
to get Aoki and Andrews
to sign off at the IRB.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.415
You didn't get Andrews.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.220
You voted for me?

39:15.286 --> 39:17.288
You made a strong case.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.824
But you're...

39:18.890 --> 39:21.192
You're booting me
off your service?

39:21.259 --> 39:23.194
Disagree with me
all you want.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.796
I expect
my residents to.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.733
I expect them to argue
passionately
for their position.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.270
And I expect them
to then accept my decision.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.674
Even when you're wrong?

39:38.209 --> 39:40.178
I can't run my team
any other way.

39:46.485 --> 39:49.220
**

39:58.096 --> 40:02.934
You know what was insane,
was the 1928 Torpedo Roadster.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.102
With the Purpleheart
trim?

40:04.169 --> 40:06.772
Ah, and that
lizard-skin interior.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.840
DR. GLASSMAN:
My neighbor in Wyoming
had a Silver Arrow.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.611
DEBBIE: Oh, I'd love
to drive one just once.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.980
(CONVERSATION FADING)

40:15.046 --> 40:17.949
Good job.
You got him walking.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.752
Debbie Wexler did it.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.888
She's a better carrot
than I am.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.691
She's a better friend.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.726
**

40:32.598 --> 40:35.066
DR. PARK: Hey, it's me.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.402
Yeah, just making sure
the check got there okay.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.572
Great, great.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.643
Hey, I have a question...

40:44.710 --> 40:45.844
About Phil.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.780
I know, I know.
He's long gone.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.783
I was actually wondering...

40:53.384 --> 40:54.553
What do you think
would've happened

40:54.620 --> 40:56.187
if I hadn't seen
you two together?

40:56.254 --> 40:58.790
**

41:11.903 --> 41:13.271
I found
my next apartment.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.007
Okay.

41:16.074 --> 41:19.210
It's has
a fireplace,

41:19.277 --> 41:20.512
and natural lighting...

41:20.579 --> 41:22.180
No. N... No.

41:22.247 --> 41:26.852
...and a really great
roommate
who's also a friend.

41:26.918 --> 41:30.121
He works a lot, so might be
hard to see him otherwise.

41:33.759 --> 41:34.993
I'm talking
about you, Shaun.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.132
I don't want to risk anything
hurting our friendship.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.969
If you say you can handle
living together,

41:45.370 --> 41:46.905
I trust you.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.340
**

41:52.778 --> 41:56.514
We... We're going
to be roommates?

41:59.685 --> 42:01.519
(EXHALES SHAKILY)
Oh...

42:04.956 --> 42:06.958
I... It has a fireplace.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.259
Yes, it does.

42:08.326 --> 42:09.628
Oh!

42:09.695 --> 42:11.529
We're going
to be roommates!

42:11.597 --> 42:14.332
We're gonna be roommates!
(LAUGHS)

42:14.399 --> 42:15.901
Okay!
Yes.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.769
Okay!
Yes!

42:17.836 --> 42:19.137
(SQUEALING)
We're gonna be roommates!

42:19.204 --> 42:20.872
Oh, y...
(LAUGHS)

42:20.939 --> 42:22.407
Yes!
(LAUGHS)
