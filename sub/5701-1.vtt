(Buzzer rings)

02:42.403 --> 02:44.435
(Buzzer rings)

02:47.000 --> 02:48.366
What the fuck?

02:48.399 --> 02:49.298
I know...

02:49.332 --> 02:50.564
I can't believe it.

02:50.597 --> 02:52.164
Me neither.

02:52.197 --> 02:52.963
Except...

02:52.996 --> 02:54.229
I, I can believe it.

02:54.262 --> 02:56.894
I mean he's hot,
he makes bank...

02:56.928 --> 02:59.026
Does, like,
P90X every morning.

02:59.059 --> 03:00.358
He's perfect.

03:00.391 --> 03:01.590
That's the point!

03:01.624 --> 03:05.122
This is what happens when you
get engaged to Mr. Perfect.

03:05.155 --> 03:09.352
Mr. Perfect lives in a universe
of limitless booty potential.

03:09.385 --> 03:11.351
I mean, come on, what
else was he gonna do?

03:11.384 --> 03:12.517
He's a guy.

03:12.550 --> 03:14.217
ELLA:
You never told
me that before.

03:14.249 --> 03:16.615
I told you all the fuckin'
time, you wouldn't listen.

03:16.648 --> 03:18.347
I was happy.

03:18.380 --> 03:19.979
Don't I have the
right to be happy?

03:20.013 --> 03:22.877
Uh... hello,
this is America.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.110
People's rights get
fucked up all the time.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.406
So, where's his diary?

03:30.906 --> 03:33.138
ELLA:
It's not in his desk anymore.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.037
He knows
I know something.

03:35.269 --> 03:38.068
I got weird and
then he got weird...

03:38.102 --> 03:39.833
And he's put
it somewhere.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.132
Like, where?

03:42.498 --> 03:44.198
He's got a
storage unit.

03:44.231 --> 03:46.496
He says we have
too much stuff.

03:46.529 --> 03:49.028
He's always tidying
away my things...

03:50.360 --> 03:51.959
It's pathological.

03:52.126 --> 03:54.457
Him and his
fucking feng shui...

03:54.491 --> 03:58.421
MOLLY:
So, you just got me
'round here to get wasted.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.618
I need your help.

04:02.651 --> 04:03.918
MOLLY:
What?

04:03.951 --> 04:04.918
To break in -

04:04.951 --> 04:06.850
MOLLY:
Ah, Jesus fuck...

04:06.884 --> 04:07.983
No!

04:08.016 --> 04:09.614
I don't
do that anymore.

04:09.647 --> 04:11.047
I need to know.

04:11.081 --> 04:13.112
You just can't help
yourself, can you?

04:13.145 --> 04:14.511
You remember what happened
last time you broke into

04:14.544 --> 04:16.577
What's his name's
email account?

04:16.610 --> 04:18.309
ELLA:
And I was right he was
still fucking his ex.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.308
Ella, you can't
pry into everything.

04:20.341 --> 04:22.040
If you don't trust him
why are you marrying him?

04:22.074 --> 04:25.072
It's because I'm
marrying him I need to know.

04:25.105 --> 04:26.304
Well...

04:26.337 --> 04:28.203
I'm not doing it.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.168
I don't know how you
talked me into this.

04:30.201 --> 04:32.200
It's because you love me.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.465
Now I just need to take
a look at that diary,

04:34.498 --> 04:37.164
Put my mind at
ease, case closed.

04:37.197 --> 04:38.829
The case with you
is never closed,

04:38.863 --> 04:40.195
That's the
fucking problem.

04:40.228 --> 04:42.194
Hey if you do this
for me it will be.

04:42.227 --> 04:44.193
I swear on the...

04:44.492 --> 04:46.158
The holy...

04:46.191 --> 04:48.890
Whatever that
thing Catholics do.

04:48.923 --> 04:50.322
Please, leave
god out of it.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.920
He's too busy
with regular wackos.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.819
I don't know why you
wanna get married anyway.

04:54.853 --> 04:56.885
It's so conventional...

04:56.918 --> 04:58.884
ELLA:
I am conventional.

04:58.917 --> 05:00.415
You know your problem is
you actually believe in

05:00.449 --> 05:04.013
All that true love
happy ever after crap.

05:04.047 --> 05:06.012
If you ask me people
aren't suited to marriage.

05:06.046 --> 05:07.978
It turns
everyone into liars.

05:08.577 --> 05:10.443
I mean, do
animals get married?

05:10.976 --> 05:12.275
Albatrosses
mate for life.

05:12.308 --> 05:15.340
Yeah but we're not
albatrosses, we're bonobos.

05:15.373 --> 05:16.539
What?

05:16.572 --> 05:19.203
Oh they're monkeys,
they're into group sex.

05:19.237 --> 05:20.903
Well listen, Molly,
I'm not a monkey,

05:20.937 --> 05:24.167
I'm not into group sex,
and Brad better not be either.

05:29.297 --> 05:31.163
And look,
it's right up ahead.

05:46.953 --> 05:48.885
ELLA:
Why the hell would Brad
get a storage unit

05:48.919 --> 05:50.450
All the way out here?

05:50.483 --> 05:52.117
MOLLY:
He's rich.

05:52.150 --> 05:54.148
Rich people are cheap.

06:08.306 --> 06:10.038
You got your
story straight?

06:10.071 --> 06:12.370
I don't need a story.

06:12.403 --> 06:13.969
He's my fiancé.

06:14.003 --> 06:17.001
He's the one who needs
to get his story straight.

06:34.455 --> 06:35.155
Hey.

06:35.189 --> 06:36.321
Hi.

06:36.888 --> 06:38.287
Oh, cute.

06:40.986 --> 06:46.082
Oh, Arnold, I found him in
someone's unit after they left.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.081
Little guy was starving,
practically had to nurse him

06:48.114 --> 06:49.813
Back to life.

06:49.846 --> 06:53.111
Sometimes, I just
don't understand people.

06:53.411 --> 06:55.276
People can be so cruel.

06:55.843 --> 06:57.108
Swipe us in, will you?

06:57.141 --> 06:58.374
Sure.

07:02.772 --> 07:06.070
So, which one of you's Brad?

07:06.103 --> 07:08.368
Oh he's my fiancé.

07:08.401 --> 07:10.400
Uh huh.

07:10.433 --> 07:12.066
And your fiancé...

07:12.099 --> 07:15.097
He knows you're snoopin
through his unit huh.

07:23.159 --> 07:24.958
I'm messin with ya.

07:24.991 --> 07:27.222
You wanna sell his golf
clubs you go right ahead.

07:27.256 --> 07:28.955
Funny, thanks.

07:29.255 --> 07:31.954
We got those uh flat bed
trolleys if ya need one...

07:31.987 --> 07:33.252
You can get Wayne
to give you a hand.

07:33.285 --> 07:34.318
MOLLY:
We're good, thanks!

07:34.352 --> 07:37.682
Just remember we
close in 25 minutes!

07:56.971 --> 07:58.770
ELLA:
This place is huge.

07:58.803 --> 08:00.368
Yeah it's not healthy.

08:00.401 --> 08:01.768
ELLA:
What?

08:01.801 --> 08:03.399
MOLLY:
All this hoarding.

08:06.331 --> 08:08.097
You know, people hanging
on to crap they don't need

08:08.130 --> 08:09.462
And they
don't even want.

08:09.495 --> 08:11.928
For years and
fucking years.

08:21.222 --> 08:23.021
Huh.

08:23.054 --> 08:25.319
Looks like it's
all underground.

08:26.385 --> 08:27.651
Hey!

08:28.218 --> 08:29.183
Hey!

08:29.217 --> 08:31.216
Can you hold
the elevator?

08:39.777 --> 08:42.042
What floor, ladies?

08:42.909 --> 08:45.407
Four, please.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.072
You'll need
a key for four.

08:47.106 --> 08:48.871
Yeah, uh, we have it,
somewhere.

08:48.905 --> 08:50.837
It's ok, go ahead.

08:56.066 --> 08:57.765
So...

08:59.098 --> 09:01.330
You got a unit here, huh?

09:01.763 --> 09:03.295
No, we live here.

09:03.328 --> 09:05.060
That's funny.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.259
My fiancé has a unit here.

09:07.293 --> 09:09.125
Your fiancé?

09:09.158 --> 09:10.891
That's nice.

09:11.757 --> 09:12.990
Do you have a fiancé?

09:13.022 --> 09:13.889
MOLLY:
No.

09:13.922 --> 09:14.888
Do you?

09:14.921 --> 09:17.619
Oh, ok.
That's pretty good.

09:23.783 --> 09:25.414
Listen, if you're not
doing anything later...

09:25.447 --> 09:27.681
Yeah, ok, we'll call ya.

09:31.211 --> 09:32.710
That was not nice.

09:32.743 --> 09:33.909
Seriously?

09:33.942 --> 09:34.776
Oh well, hey, you know, if
things don't work out with Brad,

09:34.809 --> 09:36.641
Maybe you could
hook up with that one.

09:36.675 --> 09:39.338
Seems like a real
smooth operator.

09:41.871 --> 09:42.837
We need a key.

09:42.871 --> 09:44.070
Yeah.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.367
Who is it who taught
you how to do that again?

09:47.400 --> 09:49.232
Was that
that guy Carlos?

09:49.266 --> 09:50.632
No, I taught him.

09:50.666 --> 09:51.831
Really?
Then who taught you?

09:51.865 --> 09:52.864
MOLLY:
Barry.

09:52.897 --> 09:53.964
Barry, the lawyer?

09:53.997 --> 09:55.328
MOLLY:
Yeah.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.028
Whatever happened to him?

09:57.062 --> 09:58.326
I really liked him.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.091
MOLLY:
Uh, he's doing five to 10
in a Buffalo correctional.

10:02.124 --> 10:03.124
For what?

10:03.158 --> 10:05.256
MOLLY:
Financial elder abuse.

10:05.656 --> 10:06.822
What the hell is that?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.254
He embezzled $50,000
from his grandmother.

10:09.287 --> 10:10.986
Molly, wait, look.

10:11.385 --> 10:12.484
MOLLY:
God, would you chill...

10:12.517 --> 10:14.983
Most of the time those
things are not even connected.

10:15.016 --> 10:19.147
Hamster-boy upstairs is
probably just watching porn.

10:21.046 --> 10:21.812
See?

10:21.846 --> 10:24.011
You just stick
it in and jiggle.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.838
MOLLY:
Hang on.

10:37.269 --> 10:38.735
Wait, Molly...

10:41.366 --> 10:42.633
Molly!

10:46.163 --> 10:47.763
(Whispers)
Hey!

10:53.292 --> 10:55.825
ELLA:
Why would Brad rent
something down here?

10:55.857 --> 10:58.023
MOLLY:
Yeah, I didn't think
he was this cheap.

11:00.022 --> 11:01.954
It says 4059.

11:02.386 --> 11:03.753
Come on.

11:04.085 --> 11:05.118
Come on!

11:30.335 --> 11:32.234
Wayne to reception.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.633
Wayne to reception.

11:35.665 --> 11:43.060
(Loud music
in headphones)

11:49.790 --> 11:51.089
Yeah?

11:51.322 --> 11:53.221
You wanna start
your final round?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.353
I guess...

11:54.387 --> 11:57.019
You know, that's a great
attitude you got there, Wayne.

11:57.052 --> 11:59.617
You're gonna go a
long way, believe me.

11:59.650 --> 12:02.549
Yeah, like you?

12:02.583 --> 12:03.814
Oh that's clever.

12:03.847 --> 12:05.946
Yeah, in five years' time when
you're still sweeping the floor,

12:05.980 --> 12:07.812
You won't
feel so clever.

12:07.845 --> 12:09.510
Believe me...

12:11.942 --> 12:13.075
Hey!

12:13.675 --> 12:14.940
Check the fire doors.

12:14.974 --> 12:16.273
Right.

12:16.306 --> 12:18.172
Check the fire doors.

12:20.837 --> 12:22.570
Kid's a moron.

12:40.658 --> 12:43.022
ELLA:
Shh! What's that?

12:43.889 --> 12:45.155
(Screams).

12:50.685 --> 12:53.716
Ok, I think they all definitely
heard that in Nebraska.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.582
Oh, very funny.

12:55.615 --> 12:57.247
Can we just find this fucking
thing and get out of here?

12:57.280 --> 12:58.613
Yeah.

13:10.805 --> 13:12.138
There it is.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.165
MOLLY:
You really
want to do this?

13:23.664 --> 13:24.863
ELLA:
I guess...

13:26.129 --> 13:27.662
Right.

13:35.256 --> 13:36.223
MOLLY:
Give me that thing.

13:36.256 --> 13:37.655
ELLA:
Ok.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.219
MOLLY:
Little trick I learned...

13:41.252 --> 13:42.685
From Mr. Five-To-Ten?

13:42.719 --> 13:44.084
MOLLY:
No, actually, my dad...

13:44.118 --> 13:45.850
Geez, Molly.

13:53.845 --> 13:54.944
You sure you
want to do this?

13:54.977 --> 13:55.976
Open it.

13:56.010 --> 13:57.175
Alright.

14:02.839 --> 14:03.905
Here.

14:07.136 --> 14:08.802
ELLA:
Can you see anything?

14:08.835 --> 14:10.067
Not really.

14:10.101 --> 14:11.800
More units.

14:11.833 --> 14:12.999
That's weird.

14:13.032 --> 14:14.099
ELLA:
What?

14:14.132 --> 14:15.998
I think feel
a draft in here.

14:17.597 --> 14:18.962
Hit the lights.

14:19.128 --> 14:20.028
Hurry up!

14:21.827 --> 14:22.993

14:25.891 --> 14:26.857

16:59.994 --> 17:02.359
Get me out!

17:12.051 --> 17:13.586
Get the fuck off me!

17:13.617 --> 17:14.718
Hey!

17:17.116 --> 17:18.449
Hey!

17:20.714 --> 17:22.380
Fuck!

17:22.746 --> 17:23.679
Get away from me!

17:23.712 --> 17:24.612
Ok, just calm down.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.678
ELLA:
Don't touch me!

17:25.711 --> 17:26.843
I'm not touching you.

17:26.877 --> 17:28.409
I'm a Police
officer, okay?

17:28.442 --> 17:28.975
Hello?

17:29.008 --> 17:30.341
Don't fucking touch me!

17:30.375 --> 17:30.974
What's going on?

17:31.007 --> 17:32.573
Police!

17:32.839 --> 17:33.805
I heard her shouting,

17:33.838 --> 17:35.438
I just pulled her out
of the elevator shaft.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.471
She's dead.

17:36.504 --> 17:37.703
DETECTIVE BURNS:
What?

17:38.636 --> 17:39.802
She's dead.

17:39.835 --> 17:40.834
Who's dead?

17:40.868 --> 17:42.633
Molly, she's dead.

17:44.865 --> 17:47.830
Back there,
the floor below us.

17:47.864 --> 17:49.529
I think she's in shock.

17:49.563 --> 17:52.061
Ok. Look at me.
Look at me.

17:52.094 --> 17:53.793
What's your name?

17:53.826 --> 17:54.792
Ella.

17:54.825 --> 17:55.792
Ella, I'm
Detective Burns, ok?

17:55.825 --> 17:58.523
Why don't you just tell
me what's going on here?

17:58.557 --> 17:59.789
We went down...

17:59.822 --> 18:02.287
My fiancé has a unit...

18:02.720 --> 18:04.053
There was
something in there.

18:04.086 --> 18:05.553
It...

18:06.552 --> 18:08.783
It killed my friend.

18:08.816 --> 18:11.582
Oh my God.

18:11.615 --> 18:12.980
Ok, Ella. Here's
what I need you to do.

18:13.013 --> 18:13.980
Ok?

18:14.013 --> 18:15.712
I need you to stay with
this lady right here.

18:15.746 --> 18:16.811
What's your name?

18:16.845 --> 18:17.545
Yo!

18:17.578 --> 18:18.445
What's your name?

18:18.478 --> 18:19.344
Oh, Willow.

18:19.377 --> 18:20.310
Willow, I need you
to stay with Willow.

18:20.343 --> 18:21.942
What's the number of
your unit down there?

18:21.975 --> 18:22.907
Ok?

18:22.941 --> 18:25.306
Come on, what is it?

18:25.806 --> 18:28.304
4059.

18:28.338 --> 18:29.837
Ok. You're not
gonna just leave us?

18:29.870 --> 18:32.668
I'm just gonna go check it
out I'll be right back, ok?

18:32.701 --> 18:33.834
Ok?

18:34.800 --> 18:35.733
Ok.

18:40.397 --> 18:41.530
Ok.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.733
What the...?

21:14.233 --> 21:15.632
Huh?

21:30.822 --> 21:32.555
Fuck!

21:44.547 --> 21:45.779
WILLOW:
They're homeopathic.

21:45.813 --> 21:47.645
Here, take one.

21:47.678 --> 21:48.777
ELLA:
No thanks, I'm ok.

21:48.811 --> 21:49.843
WILLOW:
You sure?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.775
They have extract
of cava root.

21:51.809 --> 21:53.841
They're great
for anxiety.

21:53.874 --> 21:55.673
They're completely
natural.

21:55.939 --> 21:59.405
I actually
sell them online.

21:59.438 --> 22:01.636
I went through a
divorce last year,

22:01.669 --> 22:06.300
And I basically
lived on these things.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.366
Where's Molly?

22:07.400 --> 22:08.565
Who?

22:08.599 --> 22:10.231
My friend!

22:10.264 --> 22:12.197
Where is she?

22:12.529 --> 22:13.695
Couldn't find
anyone down there.

22:13.728 --> 22:14.795
What?

22:14.827 --> 22:16.793
But she's down there,
I'll show you.

22:16.826 --> 22:18.592
I didn't see anyone.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.356
Do you think I'm lying?

22:22.390 --> 22:24.555
I didn't say that.

22:24.589 --> 22:27.119
Who'd you say attacked you?

22:29.319 --> 22:31.884
It wasn't a person.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.616
What do you mean
it wasn't a person?

22:33.649 --> 22:34.815
You mean,
like an animal?

22:34.848 --> 22:36.814
No, it was like a wild...

22:36.846 --> 22:38.380
Person.

22:38.413 --> 22:41.511
Ah, are you
on something?

22:41.544 --> 22:42.510
Have you been
taking drugs?

22:42.543 --> 22:43.510
What?

22:44.376 --> 22:46.241
SARAH:
Marco Perugia's...

22:46.275 --> 22:49.738
I can't find my red
Marco Perugia's...

22:49.772 --> 22:51.737
What box did
you put them in?

22:51.771 --> 22:54.370
I really have
no idea, Sarah.

22:54.769 --> 22:55.901
Ugh, for God's sake...

22:55.934 --> 22:58.333
What is your stuff
doing in my pile?

22:58.367 --> 23:00.798
This is supposed
to be my pile.

23:05.363 --> 23:06.894
It's in my pile now.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.494
You happy?

23:08.527 --> 23:11.359
I'll be happy when
we're finally divorced.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.088
Alright?

23:16.688 --> 23:19.719
Yeah, we're closing
up, so you gotta leave.

23:19.753 --> 23:21.652
Um, we really need
some more time

23:21.685 --> 23:24.783
Could you hold on a
little while longer?

23:25.283 --> 23:27.515
Uh... sorry.

23:27.549 --> 23:31.646
It's just, I came all the
way from Manhattan and

23:31.679 --> 23:35.244
I really need
to do this now.

23:35.277 --> 23:37.109
I really appreciate it.

23:37.143 --> 23:38.707
Alright.

23:38.741 --> 23:40.606
You got 10 minutes.

23:41.373 --> 23:42.739
Ok.

23:44.638 --> 23:46.237
Well, you could've
said something.

23:46.270 --> 23:49.368
Ah, what exactly did
you expect me to say?

23:49.401 --> 23:51.566
Um, I command you to keep
this establishment open in the

23:51.599 --> 23:55.631
Name of my soon-to-be ex-wife's
titanic sense of entitlement?

23:55.664 --> 23:58.295
You know, Ian,
you're a real asshole.

23:58.329 --> 24:00.461
Well, I learned
from the best.

25:07.152 --> 25:08.551
Hello?

25:30.204 --> 25:31.536
Hello?

25:36.667 --> 25:39.398
These fucking
people, man. How...

25:45.395 --> 25:46.594
Oh shit.

25:54.122 --> 25:56.088
Ok, let's go
over this again.

25:56.121 --> 25:57.254
Look, I already
told you.

25:57.287 --> 25:59.086
We were going
to my fiancé's unit.

25:59.119 --> 26:00.352
Why would he have
a unit down there?

26:00.385 --> 26:03.017
That floor obviously
hasn't been used in years.

26:03.051 --> 26:03.915
I don't know!

26:03.949 --> 26:05.648
Are you sure you're
not on something?

26:05.681 --> 26:07.114
What is it
with you people?

26:07.148 --> 26:08.380
Not everyone
is on drugs.

26:08.413 --> 26:09.346
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

26:09.379 --> 26:10.279
You gotta bring
it down a notch.

26:10.312 --> 26:11.478
Let's go back, huh?

26:11.511 --> 26:13.709
How'd you even
get down there?

26:15.276 --> 26:16.674
We put a wire
in the keyhole.

26:16.707 --> 26:18.274
My friend is good
at that stuff.

26:18.307 --> 26:19.640
What about this, huh?

26:19.673 --> 26:21.072
What about it?

26:21.105 --> 26:23.004
That unit is
on this level.

26:23.038 --> 26:24.203
Three, one, four, two.

26:24.237 --> 26:25.170
31-42.

26:25.202 --> 26:25.702
You were looking at
the last four digits of

26:25.736 --> 26:27.568
The account number.

26:33.431 --> 26:35.996
Does your fiancé
even know about this?

26:39.493 --> 26:41.359
Look, I thought he was
seeing someone else, ok?

26:41.392 --> 26:43.690
I just wanted
to have a look.

26:44.224 --> 26:45.357
Jesus.

26:45.556 --> 26:47.455
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

26:47.488 --> 26:49.654
Molly is missing we
have to go find her.

26:49.687 --> 26:52.485
I told you, I didn't
see anyone down there.

26:52.685 --> 26:54.384
But if there is,
that's a problem.

26:55.151 --> 26:57.681
And I need to get
you guys to safety, ok?

27:00.214 --> 27:01.014
Ok.

27:01.047 --> 27:02.712
There's cameras
all over the place.

27:02.745 --> 27:03.645
Let's just
go upstairs and

27:03.678 --> 27:06.177
Then you can make
them look at the tape.

27:06.211 --> 27:08.741
Well they have to,
you're a cop, right?

27:08.774 --> 27:11.041
Sure. Sure.
We can try.

27:11.074 --> 27:12.372
Yeah, ok.

27:12.406 --> 27:13.571
Elevator's out...

27:13.605 --> 27:15.238
Ah, we gotta
use the stairs.

27:15.271 --> 27:16.504
I think they're, uh...

27:16.537 --> 27:17.369
I think they're
this way.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.303
Come on.

27:18.336 --> 27:19.368
Wait!

27:19.402 --> 27:21.434
Can... can I just get
something out of my unit?

27:21.467 --> 27:22.300
I'll just be a minute.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.265
DETECTIVE BURNS:
No one's stopping ya.

27:24.664 --> 27:25.298
But...

27:25.331 --> 27:26.930
DETECTIVE BURNS:
But yeah!

27:31.460 --> 27:33.060
Come on!

27:48.217 --> 27:50.482
Oh, god damned kid!

27:50.515 --> 27:52.181
Wayne!

27:52.447 --> 27:54.180
Wayne!

27:55.579 --> 27:57.244
Wayne!

27:58.044 --> 27:59.443
Wayne!

28:01.475 --> 28:03.174
Wayne!

28:25.426 --> 28:27.092
Wayne!

28:30.557 --> 28:34.121
Check the fire doors,
that's all I asked him to do.

28:34.155 --> 28:36.619
It's not rocket science.

28:38.185 --> 28:41.150
Goddamned youth
employment program.

28:41.483 --> 28:43.315
You try and
help out a kid,

28:43.349 --> 28:45.281
Put something back
into the community...

28:45.314 --> 28:47.113
What do you get?

28:47.147 --> 28:50.877
Retards with attitude.

28:53.575 --> 28:55.407
Oh my god.

28:56.941 --> 28:58.572
SARAH:
Why the hell did
I let you pack?

28:58.605 --> 29:01.038
I mean how could I
possibly be that dumb?

29:01.071 --> 29:03.669
You're taking 60%
of my assets in income.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.101
You can't be that dumb.

29:05.135 --> 29:08.166
Well I earned every
cent, believe me.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.098
Where the fuck are
my Marco Perugia's.

29:11.131 --> 29:13.030
You wanna
consider helping?

29:13.063 --> 29:14.295
A little bit?

29:14.329 --> 29:16.627
Don't you think as we stand here
among the ruins of our marriage,

29:16.660 --> 29:18.293
There might be more important
things to think about than a

29:18.327 --> 29:20.391
Pair of fucking shoes?

29:20.425 --> 29:21.891
Such as what, Ian?

29:21.925 --> 29:23.389
To think I once
felt emotions for you,

29:23.423 --> 29:24.423
Describable as love.

29:24.456 --> 29:26.988
You see, that's that
maudlin streak of yours...

29:27.022 --> 29:28.221
You know, tell me,

29:28.254 --> 29:29.453
How's that playing with
the girls these days?

29:29.485 --> 29:31.885
It's funny, no one ever called
me maudlin before I met you.

29:31.919 --> 29:33.250
You seem to have
that effect on men.

29:33.283 --> 29:34.083
One...

29:34.117 --> 29:35.216
Particular man.

29:35.249 --> 29:36.881
Doesn't seem to
affect the others.

29:36.915 --> 29:38.614
Speak of the
others, how is Doug?

29:38.647 --> 29:40.346
I don't see so much
of him these days,

29:40.379 --> 29:41.545
Now that he's
fucking you.

29:41.578 --> 29:44.111
Yeah, well at
least he does fuck me.

29:44.276 --> 29:45.343
For the moment.

29:45.376 --> 29:46.442
Well, you should
talk to him.

29:46.475 --> 29:48.874
You know, he seems to
be enjoying himself so far.

29:48.908 --> 29:50.506
(Laughs)
Very good.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.338
I really get a kick out of
these conversations, Sarah.

29:53.370 --> 29:56.468
Well, unless you want to spend
another delightful evening in

29:56.502 --> 29:59.067
This shithole together, why
don't you go on upstairs and

29:59.101 --> 30:03.331
Talk to those assholes and get
them to keep this place open?

30:03.364 --> 30:04.530
Fine.

30:07.162 --> 30:12.825
(Whistling)

30:26.649 --> 30:28.083
Fuck!

30:32.480 --> 30:34.578
WILLOW:
It's locked?
Why is it locked?

30:34.611 --> 30:35.944
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Hey!

30:37.343 --> 30:39.142
Yo!

30:39.541 --> 30:40.975
Yo!

30:42.339 --> 30:43.373
WILLOW:
Can't you open it?

30:43.406 --> 30:44.338
DETECTIVE BURNS:
How am I supposed
to open it?

30:44.372 --> 30:46.437
WILLOW:
Haven't you got
one of those keys?

30:46.471 --> 30:47.670
What keys?

30:47.703 --> 30:49.935
WILLOW:
I don't know, I thought
you guys always had keys.

30:49.969 --> 30:52.068
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Lady, lady, I'm a
cop, not a locksmith.

30:52.101 --> 30:53.067
Shit.

30:53.100 --> 30:54.566
WILLOW:
Ok, so we're trapped.

30:54.598 --> 30:55.965
DETECTIVE BURNS:
We're not trapped.

30:55.998 --> 30:57.364
WILLOW:
Ok, I can't stay here.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.829
I have diabetes I
need my medication.

30:59.863 --> 31:00.928
You're gonna get
your medication, ok?

31:00.962 --> 31:02.027
Don't worry about it.

31:02.061 --> 31:02.894
You gotta check
your cell phones, ok.

31:02.927 --> 31:03.960
I lost mine.

31:03.993 --> 31:05.825
If I miss a dose,
it's dangerous.

31:05.859 --> 31:07.058
You're gonna get it, ok?

31:07.091 --> 31:08.090
Any signal?

31:08.123 --> 31:09.023
No.

31:09.057 --> 31:10.322
Hey!

31:13.320 --> 31:15.119
Hey, what's going on?

31:16.318 --> 31:17.284
That the man?

31:17.317 --> 31:19.583
No, I told you,
it wasn't a man!

31:19.616 --> 31:21.215
What man?

31:42.368 --> 31:43.901
Ah!

31:45.433 --> 31:48.098
There you are!

31:51.496 --> 31:53.195
Ian?

31:53.494 --> 31:55.827
Ian, did you
speak to those guys?

31:57.026 --> 31:59.391
You know what?
Fine, just don't talk to me.

31:59.425 --> 32:05.021
I cannot wait to not have to
deal with your bullshit anymore.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.418
Ian?

32:31.470 --> 32:34.303
Ah!
These goddamned lights!

33:20.774 --> 33:22.372
Ah, did you see it?

33:22.405 --> 33:23.471
No.

33:23.504 --> 33:24.971
She may be on drugs.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.336
Will you stop saying that?

33:26.370 --> 33:29.234
I told you all
I'm not on drugs!

33:29.500 --> 33:30.467
Are you?

33:30.500 --> 33:31.267
Me?

33:31.300 --> 33:32.199
No!

33:32.232 --> 33:33.698
Really?

33:34.165 --> 33:36.229
You pop enough
of those pills.

33:37.896 --> 33:39.195
Look, that thing
killed my friend,

33:39.228 --> 33:41.726
And it's
still down there.

33:41.993 --> 33:43.359
Christ!

33:43.825 --> 33:44.824
Wait!

33:46.357 --> 33:48.222
Well, what are
we gonna do?

33:48.889 --> 33:50.420
Get in the corner.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.419
Just stand back.

33:56.384 --> 33:58.216
God damn it!

33:59.082 --> 34:01.081
There's gonna be a rational
explanation for this.

34:01.114 --> 34:02.280
Right.

34:02.313 --> 34:05.145
That's why you just tried to
shoot your way out of here.

34:05.511 --> 34:06.944
There could be more
people down there.

34:06.977 --> 34:08.876
We should warn them.

34:09.342 --> 34:10.942
Ok, let's go.

34:14.239 --> 34:15.938
IAN:
Sarah!

34:17.071 --> 34:18.370
Sarah! Sarah!

34:21.967 --> 34:23.734
Oh, fuck's sake!

34:24.399 --> 34:25.797
Sarah!

34:38.924 --> 34:40.123
Sarah?

34:42.822 --> 34:44.219
Sarah?

34:44.786 --> 34:46.052
Sarah?

35:01.810 --> 35:03.774
Now do you believe me?

35:03.808 --> 35:05.040
Get behind me.

35:06.339 --> 35:07.006
IAN:
She's gone.

35:07.039 --> 35:08.006
Police!
Hold it right there!

35:08.038 --> 35:09.671
IAN:
I only left her a
couple of minutes.

35:09.705 --> 35:10.937
I said 'stop'!

35:12.036 --> 35:13.735
Oh Jesus Christ!

35:13.768 --> 35:15.267
You have to help
me find Sarah.

35:15.301 --> 35:16.733
I need you to stay calm.

35:16.766 --> 35:17.733
What?

35:17.766 --> 35:19.398
Sir, I need you stand up
against the wall there.

35:19.431 --> 35:20.264
What are you
talking about?

35:20.297 --> 35:21.430
We have to find Sarah!

35:21.463 --> 35:22.396
Who's Sarah?

35:22.429 --> 35:23.829
My wife...

35:24.028 --> 35:25.194
That is, my ex-wife...

35:25.227 --> 35:27.026
Actually,
she's still my wife...

35:27.059 --> 35:30.191
My soon-to-be-ex-wife.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.990
Why are you pointing
that thing at me?

35:33.023 --> 35:34.055
What's your name?

35:34.089 --> 35:34.855
Ian.

35:34.889 --> 35:36.353
We have to find Sarah!

35:37.020 --> 35:38.786
Ian, we gotta be smart.

35:39.752 --> 35:40.985
What do you mean, smart?

35:41.018 --> 35:42.184
DETECTIVE BURNS:
This place is huge,

35:42.217 --> 35:43.716
You can't just bust
open every door.

35:43.749 --> 35:45.048
We don't even know what's
happening down there.

35:45.082 --> 35:47.846
What's happening just
happened to my wife!

35:47.880 --> 35:49.312
That's her blood,
for fuck's sake!

35:49.345 --> 35:50.112
We don't know
that for sure.

35:50.145 --> 35:51.644
You're just going
to abandon her.

35:51.678 --> 35:53.243
I'm not saying that.

35:53.277 --> 35:55.142
Look, maybe the best way to
find your wife is to find

35:55.176 --> 35:57.174
A way out of here
and call the police.

35:57.207 --> 35:58.174
I thought he
was the police!

35:58.207 --> 35:59.006
I am the -

35:59.039 --> 36:00.138
(Loud noise)

36:15.329 --> 36:16.095
Put down your weapon!

36:16.128 --> 36:16.928
Who the fuck are you?

36:16.962 --> 36:19.060
Police! Put your
fucking weapon down!

36:20.392 --> 36:22.059
Any of you
seen him before?

36:23.258 --> 36:24.157
It wasn't him.

36:24.190 --> 36:25.090
You sure?

36:25.123 --> 36:27.021
He was kinda weird
with us earlier, but...

36:27.055 --> 36:28.088
Hey, wait a...
wait a minute.

36:28.121 --> 36:29.820
What's in your unit?

36:29.854 --> 36:30.953
I'm a cop.

36:30.986 --> 36:31.819
There are two women
missing down here.

36:31.853 --> 36:33.685
You're a cop?
Where's your uniform?

36:33.718 --> 36:35.616
Detective homicide.

36:35.883 --> 36:36.750
I'm gonna take
a look inside.

36:36.783 --> 36:39.181
You can't do that
you need a warrant.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.246
ELLA:
Is this really necessary?

36:42.279 --> 36:44.810
You can't do this,
you don't have the right.

36:44.844 --> 36:46.276
You shut the fuck up.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.141
Hey!

36:50.174 --> 36:52.139
Get off my stuff!

36:53.905 --> 36:55.704
You're living here?

36:55.738 --> 36:57.302
So the fuck what?

36:58.736 --> 37:00.767
I lost my job, ok?

37:01.700 --> 37:02.699
What?

37:02.733 --> 37:04.564
Is that a crime now?

37:04.865 --> 37:06.230
(To Willow)
You got a job?

37:06.996 --> 37:08.862
And you?

37:08.895 --> 37:11.193
He's got a gun
and a job.

37:11.227 --> 37:12.260
Big guy!

37:12.293 --> 37:12.760
DETECTIVE BURNS:
What is that?

37:12.793 --> 37:14.592
Don't touch that!

37:16.690 --> 37:18.756
It was my grandfather's.

37:19.688 --> 37:21.187
It's ceremonial.

37:21.221 --> 37:22.320
What for?

37:22.353 --> 37:23.253
Beheadings?

37:23.286 --> 37:24.852
Fuck you.

37:26.084 --> 37:28.083
This is my place!

37:28.117 --> 37:29.182
I want your
badge number.

37:29.216 --> 37:30.715
I don't have to
take this shit.

37:30.748 --> 37:31.715
Ok, just calm down.

37:31.748 --> 37:33.647
Ok, didn't I just tell
him to shut the fuck up?

37:33.680 --> 37:35.245
RASHID:
Why the fuck
should I calm down?

37:35.278 --> 37:36.311
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Shut up. Listen.

37:36.344 --> 37:38.310
I told you, there are two
women missing here, ok?

37:38.343 --> 37:40.175
His wife may have
been abducted...

37:40.209 --> 37:42.241
Her friend might
have been murdered.

37:43.673 --> 37:45.039
Somebody killed
your friend?

37:45.072 --> 37:47.571
It wasn't somebody,
it was something.

37:47.605 --> 37:50.569
You know, there is something
weird going on down here.

37:50.803 --> 37:53.034
I moved in like,
three days ago...

37:53.067 --> 37:55.299
Couldn't make my rent,
my landlord threw me out...

37:55.332 --> 37:58.164
Fucking
Bible-thumping hypocrite...

37:58.198 --> 37:59.997
Yeah, yeah,
ok, we get it.

38:00.196 --> 38:01.096
Go on.

38:01.129 --> 38:03.227
Second night after
the place closed down,

38:03.260 --> 38:05.526
I heard these noises...

38:06.059 --> 38:07.192
What noises?

38:07.225 --> 38:10.156
I don't know, noises, like
this weird fucking moaning.

38:10.190 --> 38:13.054
I always knew this
place had a bad energy.

38:13.088 --> 38:14.754
I pick up these
things...

38:14.787 --> 38:16.686
I'm very intuitive.

38:17.186 --> 38:18.751
Where do these
noises come from?

38:18.785 --> 38:19.884
I don't know.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.283
I was in here.

38:21.316 --> 38:23.748
They sort of floated around,
do you know what I mean?

38:23.782 --> 38:24.747
Not really.

38:24.781 --> 38:26.013
Were they on this level?

38:26.046 --> 38:28.179
No, they kinda
came from below.

38:28.911 --> 38:31.143
So the basement,
level four.

38:31.177 --> 38:32.609
I didn't know there
was a level four.

38:32.642 --> 38:33.908
I already was
down on that level,

38:33.941 --> 38:35.140
There's nothing
going on down there.

38:35.174 --> 38:36.206
Molly is down there!

38:36.239 --> 38:38.038
I don't know shit about
Molly or nothing like that

38:38.072 --> 38:39.238
On that level,
but on this level

38:39.271 --> 38:42.270
We got a person missing and
I gotta get us out of here.

38:42.303 --> 38:44.002
And how are we
going to do that?

38:44.035 --> 38:45.868
They lock this place up
pretty tight at night...

38:45.901 --> 38:47.133
Yeah tell me about it.

38:47.167 --> 38:50.765
But there's a maintenance
closet just down the hallway.

38:57.626 --> 38:58.660
RASHID:
I wasn't trying
to be weird...

38:58.693 --> 39:01.124
I just thought it would
be nice to like, hang out.

39:01.158 --> 39:02.857
Nice for me, anyway.

39:02.890 --> 39:05.755
I get awkward when
I talk to girls.

39:10.052 --> 39:12.284
And then
I lost my job.

39:12.316 --> 39:15.015
It wasn't much of a
catch in the first place.

39:15.782 --> 39:16.614
ELLA:
What's your name?

39:16.648 --> 39:17.781
Rashid.

39:18.813 --> 39:19.746
Will you shut
the fuck up?

39:19.779 --> 39:21.145
Yeah, that's it.

39:40.899 --> 39:42.964
They use these to cut
through people's padlocks,

39:42.997 --> 39:45.995
Like when they
don't pay their rent.

39:46.729 --> 39:48.594
Check this out!

39:55.590 --> 39:56.489
ELLA:
Are you ok?

39:56.523 --> 39:58.222
No, I'm not ok...

39:58.254 --> 40:01.753
Why would anyone be
ok in this situation?

40:01.786 --> 40:04.951
Sorry, my blood
sugar's getting too high.

40:04.983 --> 40:07.049
Ok, come on, let's go!

40:07.649 --> 40:08.616
Damn it!

40:15.244 --> 40:16.676
Goddamn timer switches.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.441
Come on!

40:20.508 --> 40:21.840
Wait a minute.

40:35.698 --> 40:37.097
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Good job.

40:38.862 --> 40:41.094
You know, it's no
smoking down here.

40:41.127 --> 40:42.760
Eat me.

40:42.959 --> 40:44.093
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Hey, come on!
We're wasting time.

40:44.126 --> 40:45.825
Let's go. We gotta
cut the chain upstairs.

40:45.858 --> 40:47.124
IAN:
Ah, what about my wife?

40:47.157 --> 40:48.556
I thought we
settled that question.

40:48.590 --> 40:49.922
IAN:
No, we didn't.

40:49.955 --> 40:51.188
We didn't
settle anything.

40:51.221 --> 40:53.453
Look, I gotta think about the
safety of these women, alright?

40:53.487 --> 40:54.520
Oh, sure you do!

40:54.552 --> 40:55.686
What about my safety?

40:55.719 --> 40:56.451
Guys...

40:56.485 --> 40:57.684
Come on.

40:58.949 --> 41:01.182
You said you were
getting divorced right?

41:01.215 --> 41:02.647
Yes.

41:02.681 --> 41:05.912
She left you,
is that right?

41:05.945 --> 41:07.911
Probably had an affair?

41:07.944 --> 41:09.777
Yeah, thought so.

41:09.810 --> 41:12.508
You learn to read
these things in my job.

41:12.541 --> 41:14.406
What'd she get?

41:14.740 --> 41:15.639
IAN:
What?

41:15.673 --> 41:18.037
In the settlement,
more than half, right?

41:18.071 --> 41:19.203
Well, she...

41:19.236 --> 41:19.836
Right?

41:19.870 --> 41:21.202
She takes all your money,

41:21.235 --> 41:23.534
Probably fucking
some other guy, right?

41:23.568 --> 41:25.033
That's gotta, that's
gotta really hurt, huh?

41:25.067 --> 41:26.066
And what's this
gotta do with you?

41:26.099 --> 41:27.765
Ok, you go
back downstairs...

41:27.798 --> 41:29.764
We come down, there's
blood all over the floor,

41:29.797 --> 41:32.628
You come back and
tell us she's missing.

41:32.662 --> 41:35.527
What the fuck
are you saying?

41:35.561 --> 41:38.058
ELLA:
You don't really think...

41:38.091 --> 41:42.589
DETECTIVE BURNS:
You, me, her were upstairs,
sure as hell wasn't one of us.

41:42.955 --> 41:44.987
You bastard!

41:47.786 --> 41:50.817
You got something
else you wanna say?

41:51.716 --> 41:53.515
Thought not.

41:57.580 --> 41:59.011
What's going on?

41:59.045 --> 42:00.478
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Fuck,

42:00.511 --> 42:03.709
You tripped the
fucking fire alarm.

42:05.174 --> 42:07.506
DETECTIVE BURNS:
We need to get
to the stairs!

42:09.505 --> 42:10.771
ELLA:
It's here!

42:16.767 --> 42:17.767
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Clear!

42:17.800 --> 42:20.398
WILLOW:
Get the fuck off me!

42:21.764 --> 42:23.396
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Get out of the way!

42:58.074 --> 42:59.441
DETECTIVE BURNS:
I tagged it.

42:59.473 --> 43:00.172
ELLA:
It's ok.

43:00.206 --> 43:00.972
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Right shoulder.

43:01.006 --> 43:01.706
ELLA:
It's ok now.

43:01.739 --> 43:04.770
WILLOW:
I just want to go home.

43:07.002 --> 43:08.634
DETECTIVE BURNS:
It's gone.

43:08.667 --> 43:09.367
IAN:
What the fuck was that?

43:09.401 --> 43:10.733
DETECTIVE BURNS:
I don't know.

43:12.399 --> 43:13.631
I guess you were right.

43:14.763 --> 43:16.397
ELLA:
Where's Rashid?

43:16.662 --> 43:17.861
Hey!

43:25.624 --> 43:26.856
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Shit!

43:33.118 --> 43:34.618
RASHID:
Hey!

43:35.451 --> 43:36.684
Hey!

43:36.717 --> 43:38.383
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Shit!

43:42.780 --> 43:44.012
RASHID:
Can you guys hear me?

43:44.045 --> 43:45.744
DETECTIVE BURNS:
That thing attacked us.

43:45.778 --> 43:46.943
Seriously?

43:46.977 --> 43:47.677
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Yeah.

43:47.710 --> 43:49.841
You need to get
to the stairs...

43:49.875 --> 43:51.707
And cut the chain.

43:57.437 --> 43:58.603
Hey!

43:59.835 --> 44:01.601
Wait a minute.

44:02.567 --> 44:03.766
DETECTIVE BURNS:
What?

44:03.999 --> 44:05.731
There is something there.

44:06.964 --> 44:07.597
DETECTIVE BURNS:
What?

44:07.630 --> 44:08.863
What's his name?

44:08.896 --> 44:09.463
ELLA:
Rashid.

44:09.496 --> 44:10.528
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Rashid!

44:10.562 --> 44:12.027
What's happening, Rashid?

44:12.827 --> 44:13.893
Can't see.

44:14.126 --> 44:15.292
Hey!

44:15.759 --> 44:17.290
Stay back!

44:17.558 --> 44:22.488
(Sound of a saw)

44:27.418 --> 44:28.684
Rashid!

44:28.950 --> 44:29.983
Rashid!

44:36.412 --> 44:37.745
Rashid!

44:57.065 --> 44:59.264
Oh my God!

45:04.661 --> 45:06.959
We're all going to die.

45:08.658 --> 45:09.558
We're not gonna die.

45:09.591 --> 45:10.690
WILLOW:
We are!

45:10.724 --> 45:11.624
Look...

45:11.657 --> 45:12.988
WILLOW:
We're all gonna die!

45:13.456 --> 45:14.622
We're all gonna die!

45:14.655 --> 45:16.620
We're all gonna die!
We're all gonna die!

45:16.653 --> 45:18.619
We're all gonna die!
We're all gonna die!

45:18.652 --> 45:20.618
We're not all gonna die.

45:20.651 --> 45:21.917
Ok.

45:22.517 --> 45:23.349
Ok.

45:23.382 --> 45:24.781
IAN:
Now what?

45:25.515 --> 45:27.046
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Huh? I don't know.

45:27.079 --> 45:28.613
I thought you had
it all worked out.

45:28.646 --> 45:29.678
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Not now, asshole.

45:29.712 --> 45:31.644
IAN:
Why not now, asshole?

45:31.677 --> 45:33.010
Hey!

45:33.043 --> 45:34.875
There's another door.

45:34.909 --> 45:36.873
At the other side
of the building.

45:36.907 --> 45:38.739
Maybe there's
a stairwell there!

45:38.772 --> 45:40.005
Why the hell didn't
you tell us before?

45:40.038 --> 45:42.670
I didn't know,
I thought it was locked!

45:42.704 --> 45:44.403
Ok. Let's go.

45:44.436 --> 45:46.001
You?

45:46.034 --> 45:48.367
You do whatever you want.

45:48.401 --> 45:50.332
I think you better
come with us.

45:50.365 --> 45:52.930
You'll be no good to
your wife if you're dead.

46:11.951 --> 46:12.851
DETECTIVE BURNS:
This way?

46:12.885 --> 46:14.216
WILLOW:
Yeah.

46:39.368 --> 46:40.867
Back up!

47:04.618 --> 47:06.584
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Fuck!

47:07.251 --> 47:08.682
ELLA:
Alright, level one.

47:08.715 --> 47:11.448
We can cross to
the other stairwell.

47:56.984 --> 47:58.551
No! Fuck!

47:59.351 --> 48:00.816
Give me those.

48:02.482 --> 48:05.214
But there was
no fire up here!

48:08.412 --> 48:10.277
Ok, let's go.

48:22.403 --> 48:24.268
Fuck!

48:31.929 --> 48:35.261
What are we
going to do now?

48:42.257 --> 48:43.889
We'll go to level three.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.888
You think that
won't be blocked too?

48:45.921 --> 48:47.787
That's where
we need to go.

48:47.819 --> 48:49.486
There's nowhere else.

48:49.519 --> 48:50.818
That's down.

48:50.851 --> 48:53.150
Why would you
want to go down?

48:54.516 --> 48:56.148
Hello?

49:03.243 --> 49:05.608
IAN:
We're not getting
out this way.

49:05.641 --> 49:07.774
You know I'm
right, don't you?

49:07.807 --> 49:10.273
Well, I guess we'll
just keep on going then.

49:10.306 --> 49:13.670
DETECTIVE BURNS:
Just keep on talking buddy, I
like the sound of your voice.

49:15.702 --> 49:18.234
Guys like that, they need to
think they're in control,

49:18.268 --> 49:19.632
They get outside
their comfort zone,

49:19.666 --> 49:21.432
They start to lose it.

49:21.931 --> 49:22.997
Are you a psychologist?

49:23.030 --> 49:26.495
I work in advertising,
but you don't need a PhD...

49:26.528 --> 49:28.727
Look, maybe if you think
he's gonna start losing it,

49:28.761 --> 49:30.659
You shouldn't
wind him up.

49:35.357 --> 49:38.754
One, two, three, four.

49:42.385 --> 49:44.217
What are you doing?

49:44.484 --> 49:45.816
There's something
in here I need.

49:47.615 --> 49:51.079
What is this a
fucking donut break?

49:52.479 --> 49:53.578
Ok.

49:53.611 --> 49:55.344
What've you got in there?

49:55.377 --> 49:57.343
My packed lunch.

49:59.674 --> 50:02.173
You touch that again,
you're gonna regret it.

50:02.206 --> 50:03.771
You just dragged us
all the way down here,

50:03.804 --> 50:05.504
You can damn
well tell us why.

50:05.538 --> 50:07.303
I don't have to
tell you shit, okay?

50:07.337 --> 50:08.868
You wanna find your
own way out of here?

50:08.901 --> 50:10.435
Be my fucking
guest, alright?

50:10.467 --> 50:11.833
What, you, you think
we're following you

50:11.866 --> 50:12.833
Because of your, uh...

50:12.866 --> 50:14.332
Your leadership skills?

50:14.365 --> 50:15.232
Because of your, uh...

50:15.265 --> 50:18.163
Outstanding,
problem-solving intellect?

50:18.196 --> 50:20.594
Oh, we're following
you because of that.

50:20.860 --> 50:22.293
This?

50:22.327 --> 50:23.326
Huh!

50:25.358 --> 50:26.724
ELLA:
Vince!

50:27.623 --> 50:29.289
This...

50:29.323 --> 50:32.853
Is telling you to stop being an
asshole and shut the fuck up.

50:32.886 --> 50:34.785
Let him go!

50:35.185 --> 50:36.817
Vince,
for Christ's sake!

50:36.850 --> 50:38.616
What's that?

50:49.576 --> 50:50.842
It's not what you think.

50:50.874 --> 50:53.407
Oh, sure, he's
collecting for Africa.

50:53.440 --> 50:55.706
You brought us
down here for that?

50:56.172 --> 50:58.404
You risked our
lives for that?

50:58.437 --> 50:59.803
He had to.

50:59.836 --> 51:03.134
If we get out of here,
there'll be an investigation.

51:03.167 --> 51:05.133
They would've
found his bag.

51:05.166 --> 51:07.199
Well, he's right, isn't he?

51:10.829 --> 51:12.695
What're you gonna do,
you're gonna shoot us?

51:12.728 --> 51:14.494
You're gonna shoot me?

51:17.292 --> 51:18.691
And what, on TV?

51:18.724 --> 51:20.523
K, you're gonna, you're
gonna back up right now, ok?

51:20.556 --> 51:22.355
I mean it.

51:33.215 --> 51:34.647
Ok, that's good,
that's good.

51:34.681 --> 51:36.180
Yeah.

51:37.412 --> 51:39.678
New York's finest.

51:43.442 --> 51:45.041
What'd you say?

51:48.073 --> 51:49.238
What'd you say you do?

51:49.272 --> 51:50.704
Advertising?

51:51.137 --> 51:53.236
So you spend your day lying to
everybody and you make, what?

51:53.270 --> 51:54.768
Two, 300 a year?

51:54.801 --> 51:56.633
Condo in Manhattan?

51:56.667 --> 51:57.732
Expense account,

51:57.766 --> 52:01.464
Company car for those
weekends in the Hamptons...

52:02.397 --> 52:04.029
Me?

52:04.063 --> 52:05.761
I put my life on
the line everyday,

52:05.794 --> 52:07.693
For 70K, before taxes.

52:07.726 --> 52:10.092
I got three kids,
mortgage is fucking killing me,

52:10.125 --> 52:12.224
House is under the water, I,
I can't even fucking sell it,

52:12.258 --> 52:17.387
And some prick like you comes in
here and tells me 'suck it up!'?

52:20.318 --> 52:21.551
Hey!

52:23.117 --> 52:24.549
Hey!

52:25.182 --> 52:26.349
Let him go.

52:26.381 --> 52:27.680
What are we
gonna do now?

52:27.713 --> 52:30.579
Without a gun,
we're defenseless.

52:34.709 --> 52:36.208
Level four.

52:36.242 --> 52:37.607
No.

52:37.641 --> 52:40.106
When Molly opened the door,
she said she felt a draft.

52:40.140 --> 52:42.105
Maybe there's an air
vent, or something.

52:42.139 --> 52:44.170
There must be a way out.

52:45.103 --> 52:47.201
I'm gonna pass out.

52:47.235 --> 52:49.467
I can feel it.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.764
I need to get to my unit,
there's insulin in there.

52:52.797 --> 52:53.731
Where, where is it?

52:53.764 --> 52:55.064
I'll get it.

52:55.097 --> 52:56.462
No, no, no, no, you,
you won't find it.

52:56.495 --> 52:58.129
Ah, it'll be
quicker if I go alone.

52:58.162 --> 53:00.627
It's just down there.
Just...

53:00.659 --> 53:02.226
I just...

53:34.471 --> 53:36.138
Fuck!

54:08.084 --> 54:09.915
I gotta live.

54:35.967 --> 54:37.199
Just wait out here.

54:37.232 --> 54:38.198
IAN:
Why don't we help you?

54:38.231 --> 54:39.198
No!

54:39.230 --> 54:41.030
I'll just be a minute.

54:50.158 --> 54:51.390
IAN:
You need some help?

54:51.423 --> 54:52.289
No!

54:52.322 --> 54:53.921
I won't be long.

55:15.674 --> 55:18.306
We need to hurry her up.

55:22.403 --> 55:24.336
Hello?

55:41.525 --> 55:43.024
Hey!

55:44.423 --> 55:45.855
WILLOW:
Hey...

55:47.022 --> 55:49.320
It's ok.

55:50.020 --> 55:52.151
Duramorph?

55:52.451 --> 55:54.083
It's the brand name.

55:54.117 --> 55:55.382
IAN:
Here.

55:56.648 --> 55:58.214
This is morphine.

55:58.247 --> 56:00.213
She's high as
a fucking kite.

56:00.246 --> 56:02.412
So how long
since your last fix?

56:04.177 --> 56:06.275
I needed it.

56:06.309 --> 56:09.074
You don't understand,
I was in pain.

56:09.108 --> 56:10.506
We're all in pain.

56:10.539 --> 56:13.071
ELLA:
She's going
anywhere in this state.

56:13.105 --> 56:15.137
Just give me a minute.

56:19.534 --> 56:22.432
We're gonna have
to leave her in here.

56:22.632 --> 56:23.631
What?

56:23.664 --> 56:25.363
ELLA:
We're locking you in.

56:25.397 --> 56:27.096
No!

56:28.361 --> 56:30.127
We're just gonna
go and get help.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.893
You're probably
safer in here anyway.

56:33.525 --> 56:35.957
IAN:
Maybe there's something
in here that we could use.

56:43.219 --> 56:44.551
Here's a scalpel.

56:45.484 --> 56:49.515
There's something better,
over there in that box.

56:50.414 --> 56:52.946
Vitamin E supplements.

56:52.980 --> 56:54.479
Open it.

57:01.974 --> 57:03.839
I bought it to
protect myself,

57:03.873 --> 57:06.371
But I've never
even picked it up.

57:06.404 --> 57:08.303
Always been too scared to.

57:08.336 --> 57:10.102
ELLA:
But what about you?

57:11.134 --> 57:12.933
That thing shows up,

57:12.967 --> 57:16.065
It's getting
100 milligrams of Propofol.

57:16.098 --> 57:17.597
It's a pre-med.

57:17.630 --> 57:20.196
Knock out an elephant.

57:28.091 --> 57:29.957
Is it locked?

57:30.622 --> 57:31.988
ELLA:
Yes...

57:32.188 --> 57:33.987
Don't open it for anyone.

57:43.081 --> 57:44.947
Hey, thank you.

57:44.980 --> 57:47.278
For what?

57:47.311 --> 57:50.243
For being ok.

57:51.909 --> 57:54.374
So what brought
you here tonight?

57:55.973 --> 58:01.037
Uh, I was looking for
something in my fiancé's unit.

58:03.968 --> 58:05.533
A diary.

58:05.566 --> 58:07.233
Why?

58:09.297 --> 58:11.796
I was trying to control
things, as usual.

58:11.830 --> 58:13.829
I shouldn't
have come here.

58:18.326 --> 58:20.324
You think you
can climb down?

58:20.890 --> 58:22.423
ELLA:
I climbed up.

58:43.076 --> 58:44.175
Ian?

58:46.474 --> 58:48.073
Ella?

59:02.398 --> 59:04.729
Stay away from me!

59:43.238 --> 59:44.771
This is it, right?

59:46.303 --> 59:47.835
Yeah.

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:08.722
IAN:
Here, let me.

01:00:09.821 --> 01:00:10.955
ELLA:
It's ok.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.219
It's ok, I got it.

01:00:48.264 --> 01:00:49.930
What is this?

01:01:06.185 --> 01:01:08.650
Oh, Jesus.

01:01:16.779 --> 01:01:18.678
Watch the door!

01:02:25.869 --> 01:02:28.034
It's him!
It's the reception guy!

01:02:28.068 --> 01:02:29.599
What do you mean?

01:02:37.195 --> 01:02:39.127
Sarah...

01:02:50.754 --> 01:02:52.852
We have to move!

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.749
Ian!

01:02:58.781 --> 01:02:59.681
Ian!

01:02:59.714 --> 01:03:01.080
We have to move!

01:03:01.113 --> 01:03:02.012
Now!

01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:03.678
STEPHEN:
What's going on here?

01:03:03.711 --> 01:03:05.710
You started a party?

01:03:27.396 --> 01:03:28.696
ELLA:
They're people.

01:03:29.129 --> 01:03:30.628
IAN:
What?

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.826
These cells are
full of people.

01:03:37.224 --> 01:03:38.989
He did this to them.

01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:40.755
STEPHEN:
You guys hungry?

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.945
How nice and
comfortable, huh?

01:04:01.974 --> 01:04:03.673
There we go.

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:05.538
There.

01:04:06.971 --> 01:04:11.535
Now, I gotta do this so
you can drink, you know?

01:04:12.668 --> 01:04:14.067
Drink?

01:04:20.929 --> 01:04:22.861
And, uh...

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.051
Now, it's not so bad.

01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:46.046
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take real good care of ya.

01:05:01.037 --> 01:05:02.036
IAN:
He's gone.

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:03.302
Run!

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:08.166
Come on!

01:06:08.161 --> 01:06:10.459
Come on! Please!

01:06:10.993 --> 01:06:12.858
Oh my God!

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:48.636
No...

01:06:48.869 --> 01:06:49.668
Fuck!

01:06:49.702 --> 01:06:50.967
Shit!

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:31.865
ELLA'S FIANCE:
What's the big deal?

01:09:33.131 --> 01:09:36.497
Why won't you tell me about
anyone you went out with?

01:09:38.127 --> 01:09:39.894
Tell... tell me,
tell me everything.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:41.993
Who's your
favourite boyfriend?

01:09:44.157 --> 01:09:46.523
Everybody's got a past.

01:10:53.014 --> 01:10:54.280
Agh!

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.812
Ugh!

01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:58.045
Ah!

01:10:58.078 --> 01:10:59.410
Agh!

01:10:59.677 --> 01:11:00.743
Egh!

01:11:14.435 --> 01:11:15.534
Ah!

01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:32.523
Aaagh!

01:11:35.587 --> 01:11:36.687
Aah!

01:11:45.448 --> 01:11:50.778
(Struggling/screaming)

01:11:51.544 --> 01:11:52.643
Ah!

01:12:11.964 --> 01:12:18.660
(Whimpering)

01:12:23.691 --> 01:12:29.220
(Whimpering)

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:02.367
Don't worry.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.232
Everything's gonna
be easy now.

01:13:24.585 --> 01:13:27.484
You know you caused
me a lot of trouble.

01:13:27.517 --> 01:13:29.782
Uh, what?

01:13:30.249 --> 01:13:32.513
Well, you
let Jeffrey out.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.177
Jeffrey?

01:13:40.309 --> 01:13:43.706
Oh my god.

01:13:57.697 --> 01:13:59.696
What are you doing?

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:01.262
Don't worry.

01:14:01.295 --> 01:14:02.262
People like it here.

01:14:02.295 --> 01:14:03.594
You're gonna like it too.

01:14:03.628 --> 01:14:05.193
No.

01:14:09.989 --> 01:14:12.655
It's easy here.

01:14:12.688 --> 01:14:14.587
"Eezzee".

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.219
ELLA:
Please.

01:14:17.552 --> 01:14:18.518
Please.

01:14:18.551 --> 01:14:19.750
STEPHEN:
I look after everything.

01:14:19.783 --> 01:14:23.715
You can forget about all your
worries from your old life.

01:14:26.813 --> 01:14:28.412
Look what I found.

01:14:28.678 --> 01:14:29.844
Your old diary.

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.475
Please.

01:14:35.673 --> 01:14:38.306
May the 10th 2008.

01:14:38.339 --> 01:14:40.371
2Pm: Peter.
Blue dress.

01:14:40.404 --> 01:14:43.768
6Pm: Dennis.
School girl outfit.

01:14:43.802 --> 01:14:46.666
New client.
His hotel.

01:14:49.664 --> 01:14:51.663
That was a long time ago.

01:14:51.697 --> 01:14:52.629
Oh I'm not judging you.

01:14:52.662 --> 01:14:53.762
I understand.

01:14:53.796 --> 01:14:55.428
You know,
you hang onto stuff.

01:14:55.461 --> 01:14:56.327
Me too.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:57.893
Sometimes hanging
onto stuff can cause

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:00.192
You a whole
heap of trouble.

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.656
But your fiancé.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:04.655
I remember him.

01:15:04.689 --> 01:15:05.621
Good looking guy.

01:15:05.654 --> 01:15:06.488
Nice car.

01:15:06.521 --> 01:15:07.853
Kinda anal.

01:15:08.652 --> 01:15:10.651
I don't think
he'd understand.

01:15:11.717 --> 01:15:16.415
But, uh, you don't have to
worry about that no more.

01:15:20.679 --> 01:15:22.578
Please let me go.

01:15:22.843 --> 01:15:24.742
Oh, well,
that's just silly.

01:15:24.776 --> 01:15:29.573
How do you know you're not going
to like it here until you try?

01:15:30.638 --> 01:15:32.405
They'll look for me.

01:15:32.804 --> 01:15:34.770
They'll look
for the others.

01:15:34.803 --> 01:15:36.469
No they won't.

01:15:36.502 --> 01:15:38.567
No one ever has.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.798
We need to get you ready.

01:15:41.831 --> 01:15:43.231
No.

01:15:44.564 --> 01:15:45.329
Oh.

01:15:45.363 --> 01:15:47.628
What do you know,
out of staples!

01:15:52.891 --> 01:16:00.354
(Mumbling)

01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:46.824
Sorry about that.

01:16:46.857 --> 01:16:47.557
Now.

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:49.489
You need to open
up your mouth...

01:16:49.523 --> 01:16:52.254
(Screams in pain)

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.318
(Groaning in pain)

01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:01.182
(Mumbling, alarmed)

01:17:03.347 --> 01:17:06.112
(Mumbling,
pleading for help)

01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:14.269
Aaah!

01:18:17.433 --> 01:18:19.399
Oh, Molly.

01:18:48.647 --> 01:18:50.147
Ah!

01:18:51.511 --> 01:18:54.177
(Sobbing and panting)

01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:16.363
Ah!

01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:52.307
Hey.
Can I help you?

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:54.239
I, uh, I have
a unit here.

01:19:54.272 --> 01:19:55.505
STEPHEN:
Sure. What's
the name on that?

01:19:55.538 --> 01:19:56.637
It's, uh, Butler.

01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:58.203
Brad Butler.

01:19:58.369 --> 01:19:59.535
Ok, let's see now.

01:20:02.267 --> 01:20:03.433
3142.

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:04.632
That's the one.

01:20:04.665 --> 01:20:06.298
I need to clear it out.

01:20:06.331 --> 01:20:07.963
Sure, no problem.

01:20:10.129 --> 01:20:13.160
My fiancé and I, we had a
bunch of stuff in there.

01:20:13.194 --> 01:20:15.093
Just old junk really.

01:20:15.592 --> 01:20:18.191
Stuff I should
have thrown away.

01:20:18.456 --> 01:20:19.390
Huh.

01:20:21.322 --> 01:20:23.453
A few weeks ago she just...

01:20:23.487 --> 01:20:25.020
Disappeared.

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.585
With her crazy friend.

01:20:27.051 --> 01:20:28.916
No one's seen 'em since.

01:20:29.184 --> 01:20:32.315
It's funny 'cause you
think you know people.

01:20:32.348 --> 01:20:33.347
I hear you.

01:20:33.381 --> 01:20:34.446
BRAD:
Yeah.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.911
Anyway.

01:20:37.344 --> 01:20:38.577
I should probably
take a look inside.

01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:40.343
You know, maybe
there's something I missed.

01:20:40.376 --> 01:20:41.476
Sure.

01:20:51.103 --> 01:20:52.969
You know what?

01:20:53.202 --> 01:20:54.001
Forget it.

01:20:54.034 --> 01:20:54.934
I...

01:20:54.968 --> 01:20:56.966
I didn't miss anything.

01:20:58.298 --> 01:21:00.964
Sometimes you just
have to face facts.

01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:02.462
Ah.

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:09.658
Y'know, I don't even know why I
kept any of this shit anyway.

01:21:09.691 --> 01:21:13.389
Sometimes it's hard
to throw things away.

01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:15.021
Yeah.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.419
You know what,
just sell it.

01:21:17.619 --> 01:21:19.452
We can take care
of that for you.

01:21:19.485 --> 01:21:22.183
Where would you like us
to forward the check?

01:21:22.216 --> 01:21:24.548
Give it to that guy.

01:21:38.406 --> 01:21:40.272
Ah hah, Tom!

01:21:40.538 --> 01:21:42.138
Come on, baby.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.533
Who the hell
taught you how to pack?

01:22:49.627 --> 01:22:51.826
