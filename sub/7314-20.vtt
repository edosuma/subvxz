WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:04.770
No kiss for your father?

00:04.772 --> 00:05.704
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

00:05.706 --> 00:07.006
Vance:
Arash kazmi is eli's

00:07.008 --> 00:08.340
New vivac contemporary.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.408
Iranian intelligence.

00:11.211 --> 00:14.013
Ziva:
Abba.

00:14.015 --> 00:14.780
(crying):
Abba!

00:14.782 --> 00:16.448
Leon?
She's dead.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.151
My wife is dead, gibbs.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.552
Where is ziva david?

00:20.554 --> 00:22.054
You are?
Ilan bodnar.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.322
Mossad deputy director.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.690
I have known ilan
since we were children.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.092
He always fancied himself a...
A son to eli,

00:27.094 --> 00:28.794
A part of my family,
which he is not.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.730
About the real reason
for eli's visit.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.265
Tricked by that dog kazmi

00:33.267 --> 00:35.300
To believe
in some ridiculous pipe dream

00:35.302 --> 00:37.036
Of peace between our countries.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.370
I'll be home soon.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.045
Ziva, does the word "virtue"
mean anything to you?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.479
In hebrew,
the word is <i>tohar.</i>

00:47.481 --> 00:49.381
Connection?
A man's middle name.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.716
Whose?
Ilan bodnar.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.218
Mcgee says his hotel room
is scrubbed clean.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.287
He could be anywhere.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.603
Noah!

01:11.605 --> 01:12.771
I'm home.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.506
Are you going in late today?

01:16.476 --> 01:19.645
My flight was awful.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.581
Slept about three minutes.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.551
I was sitting next to one
of those open-mouth snorers.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.720
A grizzly bear with a cold
would have been quieter.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.256
Oh, speaking of which,

01:31.258 --> 01:34.460
I may have to go to alaska
in the fall for work.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.228
(sighs)

01:38.364 --> 01:40.432
Honey?

01:46.473 --> 01:48.474
Noah!

01:48.476 --> 01:50.676
(sighs heavily)

01:50.678 --> 01:52.511
(quietly):
Noah.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.812
(gasps)

01:55.115 --> 01:57.382
(phone ringing)

01:59.786 --> 02:01.753
(ringing continues)

02:05.758 --> 02:07.860
Noah!

02:07.862 --> 02:09.895
(door opens, then shuts;
woman gasps)

02:21.174 --> 02:24.676
Whoever you are,
I'm calling the police.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.912
Woman: 911 operator.
Please state your emergency.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.247
(sighs)

02:28.249 --> 02:30.315
(over phone):
Hello?
Callie.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.783
(gasping):
Ben...

02:31.785 --> 02:33.252
What are you...?

02:33.254 --> 02:34.853
What...? Where's noah?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.855
I saw the back door
open early this morning.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.258
I called several times
to tell noah to close it.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.792
When I never heard
back, I decided...

02:40.794 --> 02:43.462
Ben... Where is
my husband?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.796
I looked everywhere, callie.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.865
He's gone.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.437
(rapid clicking)

03:25.439 --> 03:27.472
Do you mind?

03:27.474 --> 03:29.441
It's 8:05.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.710
Yes, I can tell time
just fine, tony.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.312
Thank you.
Then you know ziva's late.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.680
By five minutes.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.682
Something's
definitely up.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.849
You haven't noticed

03:37.851 --> 03:39.585
She's been a little off
these past few days?

03:39.587 --> 03:40.752
Oh, <i>she's</i> been off?

03:40.754 --> 03:41.987
That's a good one.
Think about it.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.690
Personal phone calls
to shmeil at all hours.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.291
Yesterday,
she came back from lunch

03:46.293 --> 03:47.859
Smelling like
thai food and beer.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.528
So she stopped for take-out.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.696
Ziva hates thai food.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.930
And she drinks on the job

03:51.932 --> 03:54.233
About as often
as she gets my movie references.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.901
Open your eyes, mchelen keller.
Something's going on.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.269
Okay, I get it.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.770
You're nosy.
You can't help it.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.305
It's called being
a good citizen.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.007
No, it's called
borderline stalking.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.009
What's next, a ziva-cam?
Maybe.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.278
Let's put a pin in that.
Tony, stop.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.981
Please stop, and please,
for the love of god,

04:08.983 --> 04:11.883
Put that pen down before
I stab you with it.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.820
(drops pen)
sorry. Look...

04:15.989 --> 04:18.824
...We both know that eli's
been on her mind lately.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.659
And his killer
is still out there.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.795
What, bodnar?
That's cia now.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.598
You think ziva would go
after him on her own?
(sniffs)

04:26.600 --> 04:29.001
Shh. I think crying tiger beef
has entered the building.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.970
Oh, hey, ziva!

04:31.972 --> 04:32.871
How are you?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.273
What did you call me?

04:34.275 --> 04:36.275
Huh? N-nothing. I didn't
call you anything.

04:36.277 --> 04:40.012
Where you been?
I had to take care
of some things this morning.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.446
Anything you'd like to share?

04:41.448 --> 04:43.282
Gibbs:
No time to share.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.883
Time to move, ladies.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.052
Naval officer's
husband has gone missing.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.887
Gibbs:
Come on, let's go.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.621
Vance:
Quick word, gibbs.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.994
Homeland's called twice.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.297
Ziva?
Yeah. Word is,
she's been sniffing around.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.032
I got a pretty good idea why.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.533
Well, she's not the only one.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.701
You're looking
around, too.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.803
No, not yet,
but if and when I do,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.872
You'll be the first to know.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.408
Team's waiting.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.650
Husband's name
is noah daniels, 37.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.819
Works as a realtor
in fairfax county.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.321
Any sign of forced entry?

05:22.323 --> 05:24.323
Oh, not according
to the police.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.825
His wallet, watch and cell
phone were found in the house.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.327
That the wife?

05:28.329 --> 05:29.695
Navy reserve lieutenant
callie daniels.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.497
Paramedics are evaluating
her for possible shock.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.600
Well, let me know
when they're done.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.806
It's gonna take a while
to process everything.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.040
This place is a total mess.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.676
Gibbs:
He went down with a fight.

05:45.611 --> 05:48.580
Well, blood trail leads
through the kitchen.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.082
I'm gonna start in there next.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.650
Anything around the perimeter?

05:51.652 --> 05:52.984
Nothing so far.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.119
But police are
still searching.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.592
Looks like a happy couple.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.030
So, uh, tell me
about this car again.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.499
Uh, older model
light sedan,

06:07.501 --> 06:08.500
Maybe a chevy.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.435
Tinted windows.
First saw it

06:10.437 --> 06:12.838
Idling in front of noah's house
around 2:00 this morning.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.139
Did you see the driver? Plates?

06:14.141 --> 06:15.407
Nah, too dark.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.575
So then what happened?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.744
Then I tried
to go back to sleep,

06:18.746 --> 06:22.080
Heard a door slam, got up and
saw that same car tearing off.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.383
(siren whooping)
when I noticed noah's door
open this morning,

06:24.385 --> 06:25.584
I got a bad feeling.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.852
Whew. Poor callie.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.987
The look on her face.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.057
Lieutenant daniels,

06:32.059 --> 06:34.159
I'm agent david
with ncis.

06:34.161 --> 06:38.063
You have been cleared to
talk to us... If that's okay.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.871
Is this really happening?

06:48.641 --> 06:52.010
Please tell me
this isn't really happening.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.481
Blood trail
stops at the door.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.683
Mcgee: Rest of the kitchen
looks untouched.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.086
No signs of a struggle,
no blood anywhere else.

07:02.955 --> 07:04.723
Wait a second.

07:10.129 --> 07:12.164
Should I open it?

07:13.466 --> 07:15.033
That's a yes.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.068
Ooh.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.470
What, mcgee?

07:21.874 --> 07:24.176
Now where's the
rest of him?

07:32.151 --> 07:34.719
Looks like it was severed
at the flexor tendon.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.154
Would have been
extensive bleeding.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.656
Definitely an injury you'd want

07:37.658 --> 07:39.024
To seek
immediate medical attention for.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.193
So, I-I went ahead
and took a tissue sample.

07:41.195 --> 07:42.861
Abby's testing it now.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.196
All right.
Very good, mr. Palmer.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.630
You know, this is great.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.966
I mean, the two of us
just sitting here working.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.802
You over there doing your thing,
me over here doing my thing.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.872
I mean, it's like-like we're
the best tag team ever, right?

07:53.874 --> 07:55.774
You want to tag in?
Huh? You want to...?

07:55.776 --> 07:56.875
Okay.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.944
You're-you're busy. You're...

07:58.946 --> 08:01.880
Based on the size and
shape of this fingertip,

08:01.882 --> 08:04.816
I would say it came from either
the third or fourth digit.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.251
Vena amoris.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.620
Actually, I was thinking,
uh, the ring finger.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.021
As am I.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.757
The romans believed that
one should wear the wedding ring

08:12.759 --> 08:15.994
On the fourth finger
of the left hand--

08:15.996 --> 08:17.863
Yes-- because a vein

08:17.865 --> 08:19.998
In that finger runs
straight through to the heart.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.133
Vena amoris.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.970
Literally, "the vein of love."

08:24.972 --> 08:27.739
Ah, so maybe the wife...

08:27.741 --> 08:29.674
That has to be left up

08:29.676 --> 08:31.843
To agent gibbs and
the others to decipher.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.879
My task is
a psychological profile.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.983
And gathering all this
has taken most of my time

08:37.985 --> 08:39.150
This morning.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.552
Say no more.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.621
Let me clean up over here,

08:42.623 --> 08:43.855
And I will jump right in.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.190
No, no.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.725
That won't
be necessary.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.860
I just need
some peace and quiet.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.696
And this work is still
a bit out of your reach.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.198
So...

08:53.200 --> 08:54.065
Uh...

08:54.067 --> 08:56.067
Oh.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.303
Okay.

08:58.305 --> 09:03.008
Um... I-I will just
leave you to it.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.076
Okay.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.981
(sighs)

09:09.983 --> 09:12.217
No. You know what?
I take it back. It is <i>not</i> okay.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.953
Look, I appreciate you throwing
me a bone once in a while--

09:14.955 --> 09:16.888
Or in this case, a finger--
but it's not enough.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.691
I want to step up in
all aspects of my career.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.927
And I will not let
you send me on my way

09:21.929 --> 09:23.762
Because you think something
is-is, what, beyond my reach?

09:23.764 --> 09:24.930
It's not beyond my reach.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.932
I can help.
I want to help.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.068
I want you to teach me... That.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.937
Are you through?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.905
I believe so, yes.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.141
Then pull up a stool.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.847
A man's life hangs
in the balance.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.115
We need to work fast.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.990
Boss, bolo is out on
noah daniels and the sedan.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.692
You get anything?
No, nothing yet.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.726
The state and local

09:54.728 --> 09:55.961
Police are on high alert.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.162
And I'm still scouring
traffic camera feeds

09:57.164 --> 09:58.363
In the fairfax area.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.898
Hope this doesn't turn
into one of those

09:59.900 --> 10:01.733
Whacked-out games
of tic-tac-toe.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.302
You know, a finger here,
an arm there.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.371
You find a head, then you got
a meat puzzle you gotta put...

10:06.373 --> 10:08.006
Noah daniels. Put it up.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.909
He was born
in schenectady, new york,

10:10.911 --> 10:13.044
The only child of martha
and samuel daniels.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.046
Both deceased.
Employed as a realtor.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.214
Trouble with the law?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.950
All I could find was
a jaywalking ticket.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.118
That's about it.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.286
Money problems?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.687
Well, still searching

10:22.689 --> 10:24.055
Bank records
from his home state,

10:24.057 --> 10:25.056
But looks like
everything's good.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.992
He's got a credit score of 810.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.161
Dinozzo, tell me
about callie daniels.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.997
There's no debt
on her end, either.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.966
Enlisted in 2005,
served two tours

10:34.968 --> 10:36.768
Before joining the reserves.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.737
Her unit's working
on a classified case,

10:38.739 --> 10:40.071
So, unable to access files.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.239
C.O. Confirmed that's why

10:41.241 --> 10:43.041
She was in san diego
the past three days.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.176
No kids, married ten years.
Tony:
Ten years.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.978
Just enough time to really
start hating each other.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.747
(grunts)

10:48.749 --> 10:51.716
My money's on the wife, boss.

10:51.718 --> 10:54.119
Well, think I got something.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.657
It's off a traffic camera
eight blocks

10:58.659 --> 11:00.058
From the daniels' house.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.094
Tony:
Well, that's our guy.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.996
Terrified captive
look and all.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.232
What's the time, mcgee?
2:15 a.M.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.768
That's right after the neighbor
saw the car fleeing the scene.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.404
Gibbs:
Keep with it.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.339
Check with homeowners
and the residents in the area.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.174
See if anybody's seen that car
in the last eight hours.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.846
It's about time, gibbs.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.148
We got to hop to it.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.316
Strange things
are brewing.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.118
Mercury's in retrograde,
just so you know.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.186
Abby...

11:28.188 --> 11:29.888
Who knows what kind of mayhem

11:29.890 --> 11:31.823
Is gonna pop up
after the sun goes down.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.258
So, chop-chop.
Over here.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.062
I'm still, um, piecing
everything together,

11:37.064 --> 11:39.064
But this is what
we know so far:

11:39.066 --> 11:41.332
Since most of the
destruction was contained

11:41.334 --> 11:44.169
In the family room,
it's clear that noah daniels'

11:44.171 --> 11:46.271
Abductor didn't violently

11:46.273 --> 11:48.273
Enter... The house.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.809
That's a countertop, gibbs.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.911
Um, and there's no
evidence of a chase.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.180
Gibbs:
Knew the person. Talked to him.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.182
Judging from the blood

11:57.184 --> 11:59.050
On the couch,
I'm betting

11:59.052 --> 12:00.351
That the finger
was cut here.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.387
And the tissue from
the finger is a dna match

12:02.389 --> 12:03.922
To the blood in
the house, so...

12:03.924 --> 12:06.157
It definitely belongs
to-- or, I guess,

12:06.159 --> 12:09.160
It used to belong
to noah daniels.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.729
No weapon found at the scene.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.064
Abby: No, and there's
no prints either.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.400
Except for ones that
match lieutenant daniels

12:15.402 --> 12:17.502
And her husband, but
that makes total sense

12:17.504 --> 12:19.037
Because it is their house.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.805
We could be dealing
with a pro.

12:22.007 --> 12:25.910
And he may have more than
a few special skills.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.917
See how the finger was
severed right at the joint?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.320
The wound is uniform.
There's no rough edges.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.521
It's almost...
Surgical.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.123
Yeah.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.958
Our suspect
has trauma training.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.227
He knows how to detach
a finger cleanly.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.762
But lucky for us,

12:43.764 --> 12:45.497
He left something
more than a finger.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.503
You got a second
blood type.

12:51.505 --> 12:55.840
And it's not from the
lieutenant or her husband.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.076
Find a match,
we find our suspect.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.245
Abby:
Hopefully before sundown.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.247
Mayhem, gibbs.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.549
Mayhem.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.984
You saw him.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.218
So he's okay?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.486
We believe he's alive, yes.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.954
Then where is he?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.423
Who took him?
We're working as fast as we can.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.559
Well, work faster-- I need
to know where my husband is.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.228
You said earlier
that you talked last night.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.396
What time was that?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.198
Do we need to go
through this again?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.066
It's important
we get all the facts.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.101
Fine.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.335
(sighs)

13:24.337 --> 13:27.272
It was around 7:00 my time.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.374
Noah was home.
He was getting ready for bed.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.110
I... Heard the news on.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.945
Noah always plays
on the computer

13:33.947 --> 13:36.014
And watches news
before he goes to bed.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.951
Drives me crazy.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.454
He sound agitated?
Upset?

13:43.456 --> 13:46.090
No. No, he was fine.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.827
None of this
makes any sense.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.931
Was your husband ever involved
in, um, illegal gambling? Drugs?

13:52.933 --> 13:54.465
Are you kidding?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.334
Noah doesn't like anything

13:56.336 --> 13:58.336
That makes him feel
like he's losing control.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.839
He fight with anyone recently?
There any threats?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.173
Not that I know of.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.909
How about with the two of you?
Any issues?

14:04.911 --> 14:07.011
I love noah.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.348
And I just...

14:11.483 --> 14:15.553
When I walked into
the house this morning...

14:16.889 --> 14:18.356
...I was tired.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.893
I was bitching
about stupid stuff.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.896
Ten seconds later,
none of that mattered.

14:24.898 --> 14:28.066
All that did was
that my husband was gone.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.134
Gone.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.138
I just want him back.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.879
You reading ziva's diary again?

14:40.881 --> 14:42.914
She's trolling
for news on bodnar.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.116
You know, you really need
some kind of hobby.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.118
Like boggle.
Or scrapbooking.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.653
This is not good, mcgee.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.655
Tony, leave it alone.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.557
I'm just saying,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.626
She's hopped
on the rogue train before.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.294
Gibbs:
Bolo status.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.362
Now.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.631
Uh, well, no news
is bad news, boss.

14:59.633 --> 15:02.267
Trail's stone-cold
on the sedan.
Mcgee:
And no recent attempts

15:02.269 --> 15:03.568
To call lieutenant
daniels' cell phone,

15:03.570 --> 15:05.169
But we do have
something else.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.671
Bank records
in the victim's home state

15:06.673 --> 15:10.008
His father made a killing
in the construction business.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.944
Left the bulk of his fortune to
his son when he died last year.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.345
That's more than
two million dollars.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.281
If this lunatic

15:16.283 --> 15:18.583
Is after noah's inheritance,
he'll never get it.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.684
Why is that?

15:19.686 --> 15:22.687
His father worked hard
his whole life.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.656
Noah would rather die
than give it up.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.324
You a signee on the account?

15:26.326 --> 15:28.326
That's what
his father wanted.

15:29.461 --> 15:33.364
(phone ringing)

15:33.366 --> 15:34.499
Gibbs:
Mcgee.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.334
Mcgee:
Unknown caller.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.268
Could be the kidnapper.

15:37.270 --> 15:41.372
Ziva: Keep him on the line
as long as you can.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.310
Hello?

15:45.312 --> 15:46.311
(staticky):
Callie?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.246
Oh, my god, noah.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.714
Are you all right?

15:49.716 --> 15:51.616
Wh-where are you?

15:51.618 --> 15:54.085
(staticky):
I'm not sure. It's dark in here.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.388
I miss you so much.
I miss you, too.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.690
I'm gonna
get you home.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.725
You just need to hold on, okay?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.293
Noah: I'll try...
Man: Shut up!

16:03.295 --> 16:05.263
Man:
Meet me or he dies.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.564
Noah: No, callie, it's a trap!
(struggling, clattering)

16:06.566 --> 16:09.067
Noah.
What's going on?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.335
(two gunshots over phone)
noah!

16:10.337 --> 16:11.469
(thudding over phone)

16:11.471 --> 16:15.473
Mcgee: 1673 north
chesapeake center drive.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.108
Just off route 123.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.443
Dinozzo, let's go.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.745
Ziva, stay with her.
Please find him.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.226
Tony: Federal agents!
Step out of the car!

16:41.333 --> 16:43.634
Ncis!
Let me see your hands!

16:54.213 --> 16:56.581
Tony: Lots of blood, boss.
He's gone.

17:08.427 --> 17:10.762
(helicopter flying over)
all right. Yeah.

17:10.764 --> 17:12.230
Hey, boss.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.332
No bullets or shell casings
found in the car.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.666
Could've been shot
somewhere else.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.201
You think this just became
a recovery situation?

17:17.203 --> 17:18.202
Maybe.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.138
So how do we tell the wife?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.739
We don't.
Not till we have a body.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.541
(ringtone chimes)

17:25.445 --> 17:29.747
Car's registered to a landers
orton from roanoke, virginia.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.683
What kind of name is landers?

17:32.685 --> 17:34.685
Landers:
<i>It's like I said.</i>

17:34.687 --> 17:37.488
Y-you got the wrong guy.
I didn't kidnap nobody.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.123
It's your car, mr. Orton.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.691
Victim's blood
was found inside.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.060
Name's noah daniels.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.694
Take another look
and tell us where he is.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.197
I said I don't know.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.698
I never seen this guy
before in my life.
Where is he?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.567
Please, I don't know anything.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.601
We're done.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.403
Lock him up.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.773
I think my brother might be
involved, all right?

18:01.847 --> 18:04.849
My kid brother darryl.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.718
Keep going.
I...

18:07.720 --> 18:11.456
I lent him my car
a few days ago.

18:13.325 --> 18:17.862
He said he had a job interview
out in fairfax.

18:17.864 --> 18:21.232
But when he didn't come back,
I knew something was up.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.667
You talk to him since?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.635
No. Not a word.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.804
But he...

18:26.806 --> 18:27.872
I think he took
my debit card, too.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.574
(tony scoffs)

18:29.576 --> 18:32.410
See, this is why I'm so glad
I don't have siblings.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.811
Darryl might've screwed up
before,

18:33.813 --> 18:37.148
But he is not capable
of what you guys are saying.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.251
He's a good kid.
He-he's just kind of...

18:40.253 --> 18:42.587
Lost is all. He-he...

18:42.589 --> 18:44.589
All he wants is to...

18:44.591 --> 18:46.824
Clean up and stay out
of the big house.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.294
He's served time?

18:54.833 --> 18:56.734
Just released six months ago.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.372
I don't recognize him.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.773
And you're sure your husband
didn't know him?

19:02.775 --> 19:03.774
I'm not exactly

19:03.776 --> 19:05.910
Sure of anything right now.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.716
I want to know
how the hell this happened.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.284
You had him,
agent gibbs.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.853
I heard my husband's
voice on the phone.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.889
He was this close,
and you just let him get away.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.557
Doing our best, lieutenant.
Your best

19:19.559 --> 19:21.526
Isn't good enough.
Not for me.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.760
Look, I'm sorry.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.595
I know you're
all working hard,

19:24.597 --> 19:26.831
But I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.435
We need to find this bastard.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.441
Background. Let's go.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.943
Darryl orton, 25.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.478
Raised in southwest virginia,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.613
Dropped out of high school
his sophomore year.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.348
In and out of jail ever since.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.416
Graduated
from shoplifting

19:45.418 --> 19:46.918
To the rough stuff
in no time.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.354
Last conviction was assault with
a deadly weapon in may 2011.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.789
Brother. Debit card activity.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.324
Uh, nothing since this morning,

19:53.326 --> 19:55.226
But I did find multiple charges

19:55.228 --> 19:57.728
To a casita rebecca's restaurant
over the last week.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.764
And, boss, noah daniels
has been there

19:59.766 --> 20:01.299
More than a few times himself.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.767
Time stamps on the receipts show

20:02.769 --> 20:04.235
That they were both there
two days ago.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.803
Means our victim was targeted.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.806
We're just starting
to put it together here.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.508
Lieutenant daniels
needs her husband,

20:10.510 --> 20:11.809
And we need answers.
In the meantime,

20:11.811 --> 20:13.511
I'll keep the fbi
in the loop.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.379
They've set up a tip line.
They're putting a freeze

20:15.381 --> 20:16.514
On daniels' trust account.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.382
I'll let you know
what they find.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.587
Ziva:
<i>Do not worry, callie.</i>

20:22.589 --> 20:23.854
We will find him.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.693
I lied to you.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.963
Things have been bad...

20:31.965 --> 20:33.864
Between noah and me.

20:33.866 --> 20:34.865
(clears throat quietly)

20:34.867 --> 20:36.801
And, um...

20:36.803 --> 20:38.736
And I think I fell
out of love with him.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.974
And this morning, realizing
that he was gone,

20:42.976 --> 20:45.743
I know it sounds crazy, but...

20:48.580 --> 20:50.781
...I knew I still loved him.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.887
Knowing he's hurt...

20:56.889 --> 20:57.922
Lieutenant...

20:57.924 --> 20:59.924
And what am I doing?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.425
Nothing.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.893
I'm just sitting here
waiting for you guys

21:02.895 --> 21:04.328
To try and get him back.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.963
It is hard
to let others take over.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.699
Well, I'm not that girl.
I don't let others take over.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.334
I fight for what I want.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.603
Your husband is still out there.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.939
Your coworkers don't think so.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.009
I saw the looks
on their faces earlier.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.411
They think he's dead,
don't they?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.818
Well, I know he's alive,
agent david.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.390
I can feel it in my bones.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.426
Tony: <i>If her husband</i>
<i>doesn't turn up alive,</i>

21:35.428 --> 21:36.994
Grief's gonna be
ten times worse.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.996
Hope is all she has, tony.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.800
It's got to be hard
not to be in control.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.803
She will persevere.
Mmm. What choice
does she have, right?

21:45.805 --> 21:47.505
It's not about choice.
It's about survival.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.840
She will not stop
until she gets her closure.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.043
We still talking
about the lieutenant?

21:53.011 --> 21:55.012
Please do not go there.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.415
I'm fine.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.919
Diego, deliveries in the back.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.021
I think that's her.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.392
Rebecca chaidez?

22:08.394 --> 22:11.395
Agents david and
dinozzo from ncis.

22:11.397 --> 22:12.697
We called.
This man,

22:12.699 --> 22:13.864
Noah daniels, he's missing.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.599
We know he was here
a few days ago.

22:15.601 --> 22:16.701
Did you see him?

22:16.703 --> 22:18.035
He's missing?

22:18.037 --> 22:20.071
I just... I saw him last week.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.972
He comes in here
every day for lunch.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.074
Really nice guy.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.375
Never give you any problems?

22:24.377 --> 22:26.077
Mostly keeps
to himself.

22:26.079 --> 22:28.412
A few of my waiters
have become friends with him.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.981
Told them that he came
into some money recently.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.953
We also know
he is a customer of yours.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.088
Do you recognize him?

22:37.090 --> 22:38.556
Wish I didn't.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.091
Darryl orton.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.592
Horrible temper.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.994
I've had to call the cops
on him a few times,

22:43.996 --> 22:45.429
After fights that he's picked.

22:45.431 --> 22:46.931
Do you know
if mr. Orton ever

22:46.933 --> 22:48.132
Approached mr. Daniels?

22:48.134 --> 22:51.001
He did get into his
face a few days ago.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.770
(phone rings)
said he heard
about the money.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.105
Did orton say
anything else to him?

22:54.107 --> 22:55.639
Ziva:
I have to take this.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.475
Excuse me. Sorry.

23:01.012 --> 23:03.114
What else did orton
say to him?

23:03.116 --> 23:04.648
(speaking hebrew)

23:04.650 --> 23:07.151
Chaidez: Like I said,
he was drinking a lot...

23:08.820 --> 23:11.589
Ah. The duck keeping you up
late again, palmer?

23:11.591 --> 23:13.691
Oh, no.
I asked to be here.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.693
"begged" is a more
appropriate description.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.995
Jimmy: Well, I thought
it was time that I...

23:17.997 --> 23:19.430
Learned
the psychological side.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.998
Yeah, well, you're moving up
in the world, jim.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.767
Mm-hmm!
Ducky:
Yeah, well, right now,

23:22.769 --> 23:24.034
He's just moving.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.035
Hmm?

23:25.037 --> 23:26.470
Do you mind?

23:26.472 --> 23:29.073
Oh...!
Ducky: Anyone who

23:29.075 --> 23:32.143
Abducts and mutilates
his victims with such...

23:32.145 --> 23:35.780
Well, in such a violent manner,
has no regard for human life.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.916
Which leads us to our
suspect, darryl orton.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.051
State records list him as

23:41.053 --> 23:43.053
A tortured soul.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.089
Born into poverty,
third of nine children,

23:45.091 --> 23:46.991
To glenda jean orton.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.459
Put up for adoption.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.161
Yeah, and the case worker said
that he was told

23:50.163 --> 23:52.430
His whole life that he was
a total waste of space.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.866
Ducky:
Which leads to feelings of
worthlessness and despair.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.169
He thinks
he doesn't deserve to be here.

23:58.171 --> 24:00.137
As a result,
he lives a life

24:00.139 --> 24:01.639
Without fear.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.874
Death doesn't scare this guy.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.543
Not much does.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.711
In other words,
we feel

24:07.713 --> 24:09.947
You're headed
for a violent showdown.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.515
We track him down
before he hurts somebody else.

24:11.517 --> 24:12.683
Jimmy:
The question is,

24:12.685 --> 24:14.518
Though, where is he?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.220
"craves a sense of belonging.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.855
Wants a real family."

24:17.857 --> 24:19.890
Jimmy:
The one that he has is

24:19.892 --> 24:21.725
A total dysfunctional mess.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.961
Yes, but we tend to run
to what we know best.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.230
I believe he'd still rather be

24:26.232 --> 24:28.632
Near them than anywhere else.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.101
The woods--
southwestern virginia.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.870
Near his brother.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.547
Decaf skinny
with a double shot of hazelnut?

24:43.549 --> 24:45.115
Can't believe you
made me order this.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.584
It's not even real
coffee, you know.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.118
Highlight of my day, leon.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.487
Let me have it.

24:51.189 --> 24:53.224
Tom morrow.
It's been a long time.

24:53.226 --> 24:55.693
Is homeland treating you
all right?

24:55.695 --> 24:57.928
Bureaucratic
nightmare most days.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.997
But I'm settled there.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.267
Doesn't mean I don't miss
the director's chair at ncis.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.135
Well, it misses you back.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.204
(morrow chuckles)

25:07.206 --> 25:09.273
Hmm.

25:10.742 --> 25:12.510
We're not the only ones

25:12.512 --> 25:14.912
Who know agent david
is hunting around.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.615
Cia's aware, too.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.751
She needs closure, tom.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.153
And you don't?

25:25.290 --> 25:28.158
If it were up to me,
I'd give you his coordinates

25:28.160 --> 25:30.160
And tell you to have at it.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.962
But it's not, so I can't.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.532
Saying you know where he is?

25:34.534 --> 25:37.868
Recent intel has him
still in rome.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.570
Hard though this seems,

25:39.572 --> 25:42.206
You're gonna have to trust
that we'll take care of it.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.308
I do.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.612
Tell agent david to stay away.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.183
It's the best thing
for everybody.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.220
Search of the woods near orton's
childhood home was a bust.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.088
No sign of him.
Gibbs:
Mcgee.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.256
Surveillance cams?

25:59.258 --> 26:00.324
Keeping an eye
on everything

26:00.326 --> 26:01.692
From here to roanoke.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.594
Local and state
authorities

26:03.596 --> 26:05.863
Are sending updates, too,
but we're at a standstill.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.232
It appears the calls to
lieutenant daniels have stopped.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.633
She safe at home?

26:09.635 --> 26:10.901
Dorneget is standing by.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.336
Orton could have disposed

26:12.338 --> 26:14.271
Of noah daniels' body
and fled the state.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.073
What if we never find his body?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.575
Then we keep
going until we do.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.244
Agent david's right.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.613
It's the only way
to build a solid case.

26:22.615 --> 26:25.282
Mcgee:
Uh, boss, the trust account's
been compromised.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.584
Money's gone.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.219
Vance:
It's not possible.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.122
Somebody hacked in.
Mcgee:
And it looks

26:32.124 --> 26:33.691
Like orton opened
an account this morning

26:33.693 --> 26:35.092
At a bank in southern virginia.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.961
Made a deposit for 37 grand.

26:36.963 --> 26:37.928
Ziva:
So orton

26:37.930 --> 26:39.096
Wiped out the
trust fund,

26:39.098 --> 26:42.766
Sounds pretty complex
for a high-school dropout.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.102
Yeah. Too complex.

26:48.707 --> 26:50.040
Gibbs. Hi.

26:50.042 --> 26:54.011
About the way noah daniels
was taken from the house?

26:54.013 --> 26:56.780
How do you always know what I'm
going to say before I say it?

26:56.782 --> 26:58.115
Gifted, abbs.
Gifted. Go.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.117
Abby: Okay, now, we know
that this was a brutal fight.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.885
I mean, brutal enough
to knock over furniture,

27:01.887 --> 27:03.053
And send pictures flying.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.789
And my guess is that
noah daniels was kicking

27:05.791 --> 27:07.625
And screaming the whole way.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.093
But take a look at this.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.397
If he were kicking
and screaming,

27:13.399 --> 27:15.799
Then these
throw rugs would be

27:15.801 --> 27:17.635
Pretty messed up,
and there would be

27:17.637 --> 27:19.403
Scuff marks
all over the walls.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.138
And yet...
(typing)

27:21.140 --> 27:22.006
♪ ta-da!

27:22.008 --> 27:23.340
The walls are clean,

27:23.342 --> 27:26.377
And the rugs
were barely even moved.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.379
There is nothing to indicate

27:28.381 --> 27:31.048
That noah daniels struggled
on his way out the door.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.249
Probably because...

27:32.251 --> 27:33.984
He passed out.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.053
He had to be carried.
Bingo.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.055
But now for the huge part.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.923
And I mean that literally.

27:39.925 --> 27:42.326
Noah daniels was
six inches taller

27:42.328 --> 27:45.396
And 50 pounds heavier
than darryl orton.

27:45.398 --> 27:49.033
There is no way orton carried
him out of there on his own.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.668
He had help.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.877
Mcgee: Darryl orton's
brother has an alibi.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.245
He was working
a graveyard shift

28:01.247 --> 28:04.014
At a roanoke pulp mill
the last two nights.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.083
Supervisor confirms it.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.085
As does security camera footage.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.888
Contact with anyone besides
the brother this past week?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.456
Orton's kept
pretty much to himself

28:12.458 --> 28:14.124
Since his release
from prison.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.926
No cell phone, no job,

28:15.928 --> 28:18.095
Not even a pissed-off
ex-girlfriend to contact.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.330
Restaurant owner ever see
him come in with anybody?

28:20.332 --> 28:21.398
(phone ringing)
no. Never.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.966
Mcgee.

28:22.968 --> 28:26.203
(indistinct voice
speaking over phone)

28:26.205 --> 28:28.439
Yes, I'll tell him.
Thank you.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.340
Fbi just got a credible tip.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.875
Orton?
Person matching

28:31.877 --> 28:32.943
His description
was just seen

28:32.945 --> 28:34.311
Checking into the
stargazer motel

28:34.313 --> 28:36.280
Off I-66 an hour ago.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.415
Dinozzo, ziva, let's go.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.266
Darryl orton!

28:56.268 --> 28:58.368
Ncis. Open up!

29:25.797 --> 29:27.898
He left something.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.969
"sorry to all I hurt.
He's dead.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.971
I threw his body
in the potomac."

29:33.973 --> 29:37.374
Maybe we'll give lieutenant
daniels closure after all.

29:40.078 --> 29:41.845
The bullet entered here

29:41.847 --> 29:44.414
On his front lobe, but, uh,

29:44.416 --> 29:48.152
The exit wound is not consistent
with a self-inflicted gunshot.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.520
He never saw it coming.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.855
No gunpowder residue
on his hands, either.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.457
Ducky:
This was not a suicide.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.325
Well, someone sure wanted
to make it look like it was.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.361
I might know who.

29:59.164 --> 30:00.564
Give me an update
on noah daniel's body.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.266
Tony:
Well, state police
are still dragging

30:02.268 --> 30:04.835
The river near the spot
where orton abandoned the car.

30:04.837 --> 30:08.038
Yeah? You got anything?
No. Not a finger or a toe.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.406
Not even a shred of clothing.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.408
So I guess the note was meant
to throw us off.

30:11.410 --> 30:12.509
You catch up fast, mcgee.

30:13.344 --> 30:14.411
Uh, motel manager confirms

30:14.413 --> 30:16.280
Only the cleaning crew

30:16.282 --> 30:17.981
Accessed orton's room before
he checked in this morning.

30:17.983 --> 30:21.418
Security cameras have been down
for repair all week.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.253
Abby:
Gibbs, gibbs, gibbs!

30:23.255 --> 30:25.856
Gibbs, gibbs, gibbs, gibbs!
Sounds like abby
had a breakthrough.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.425
Correct-- with "break"
being the operative word.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.195
Or more specifically,
what was not broken.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.930
Take a look at this,
and tell me what you see.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.998
Blissful ignorance, rent-a-tux.

30:35.533 --> 30:37.568
Sorry. Never mind.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.570
No cracks.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.605
Frame is not damaged.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.140
Lieutenant daniels said

30:43.142 --> 30:45.175
That was on the wall
above the couch.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.044
Abby:
Right. There is no way that

30:47.046 --> 30:48.912
That landed
on a hardwood floor

30:48.914 --> 30:50.047
Without a scratch.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.481
And there's more.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.217
Mcgee, can you put up
the file I sent you?

30:56.955 --> 30:58.622
Okay, so,

30:58.624 --> 31:00.858
Look at the position
of the couch.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.326
See how it's completely
turned over on its side?

31:02.328 --> 31:04.027
Flipped over
during the fight?

31:04.029 --> 31:05.329
That's what I
thought, too, but

31:05.331 --> 31:08.332
The couch has a
solid oak frame.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.001
It's impossible for it
to end up like that

31:11.003 --> 31:13.370
By just being bumped
into during a fight.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.938
Must have been placed that way.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.106
Yeah, which means...

31:16.108 --> 31:17.507
Crime scene was staged.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.509
Mcgee: So, whoever staged
orton's death to look

31:19.511 --> 31:21.345
Like a suicide...
Went out of his way

31:21.347 --> 31:23.013
To make it look like
noah daniels was in danger.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.214
Ziva: And that can
only be one person.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.415
Noah daniels.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.617
Call to the tip line--
mcgee, who made it?

31:26.619 --> 31:28.252
Mcgee:
Anonymous.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.020
Didn't leave their name,
but I've got the recording.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.388
Man: You're sure you
couldn't be mistaken.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.390
Woman:
No. I'm positive it was him.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.094
Woman: He was walking into
the stargazer motel off I-66.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.096
He had on a gray
sweatshirt and jeans.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.365
Please, you have
to send someone out there.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.134
Man:
Dispatching unit right away...

31:44.136 --> 31:45.302
You don't have to yell.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.970
I said I was leaving right now.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.439
I just want to know
how this happened.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.142
You said nobody was
going to get hurt.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.214
Talking to your boyfriend?

31:57.216 --> 31:58.515
That was business.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.484
Always is.
Excuse me?

32:00.486 --> 32:02.152
Ziva: We know that this is
your second restaurant

32:02.154 --> 32:04.187
To fall into debt
in the past five years.

32:04.189 --> 32:06.623
We also know noah daniels
was helping bail you out.

32:06.625 --> 32:10.494
We saw the flirty e-mails,
we have the phone records.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.496
Yes, he helped me.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.498
But we were friends, that's it.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.233
So, when did you
and your friend decide

32:16.235 --> 32:17.401
To fake his disappearance?

32:17.403 --> 32:19.303
Correction, ziva-- death.

32:19.305 --> 32:22.005
The severed finger
was a nice touch.

32:22.007 --> 32:23.674
Clean cut right at the knuckle.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.542
Who knew all that
culinary school training

32:25.544 --> 32:27.678
Would come in handy?

32:30.181 --> 32:32.683
What you're saying is crazy.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.151
I'm a good person.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.086
I would never...
Except you did.

32:36.088 --> 32:39.122
Hmm. And a man's dead
because of it.

32:41.092 --> 32:43.961
I had no part in that.

32:43.963 --> 32:47.597
Noah, he's...
He's lost control.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.266
We were just supposed
to get away.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.567
We weren't supposed to deal
with his wife, and...

32:50.569 --> 32:52.336
Deal with a messy divorce?

32:52.338 --> 32:53.603
And splitting the inheritance.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.439
No. That money is noah's.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.107
His wife had no part
in that trust.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.642
Is that what he told you?

32:58.644 --> 33:01.144
He was lying.
Big surprise.

33:05.616 --> 33:08.552
(sighs)

33:08.554 --> 33:10.620
I trusted him.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.155
(sighs)

33:12.157 --> 33:14.591
He kept telling me
not to worry.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.460
And that...

33:16.462 --> 33:18.228
Everything was going
to be okay,

33:18.230 --> 33:19.596
But everything
happened so fast.

33:19.598 --> 33:23.300
And then when I found
out that darryl was...

33:27.171 --> 33:29.339
What's going to happen now?

33:29.341 --> 33:32.542
What are you going
to do to me?

33:32.544 --> 33:35.679
Well, you help us,
maybe we can help you.

33:37.482 --> 33:40.083
Where is he?

33:48.760 --> 33:50.660
Looks pretty good
for a dead guy, boss.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.463
Okay, I don't even know
what that means.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.631
Mcgee:
Ncis.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.134
Get up.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.303
Get on your feet.
Okay.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.672
Okay, no need
to get rough about it.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.541
(handcuffs clicking)

34:04.543 --> 34:06.209
I can explain everything.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.811
Explain it to your wife.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.056
How could you?

34:19.058 --> 34:21.291
Do you have anything to say?

34:24.529 --> 34:26.096
I can't believe you.

34:35.606 --> 34:37.741
I'm done.

35:01.466 --> 35:02.532
(clicking pen)

35:02.800 --> 35:04.234
Paperwork?

35:05.203 --> 35:06.369
Not exactly, boss.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.371
Go home.
Case is closed.

35:08.373 --> 35:10.874
I saw mcgee leave;
ziva, too.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.376
(clicking pen)

35:16.180 --> 35:17.814
Are you going to keep
doing that?

35:17.816 --> 35:20.150
Doing what?

35:21.552 --> 35:23.887
Something on your mind,
dinozzo?

35:24.856 --> 35:26.490
If ziva was up to something,

35:26.492 --> 35:28.458
You'd want to know about it,
wouldn't you?

35:28.460 --> 35:30.560
I'd want to know
she's safe.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.629
But you'd want
to respect her privacy.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.397
Unless she was in too deep.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.134
Why?
What is this about?

35:37.136 --> 35:39.736
Permission to look around, boss.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.638
You worried about her?

35:43.908 --> 35:45.775
Then go find her, dinozzo.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.583
Now.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.757
Abby:
<i>Tony, it's unethical.</i>

36:00.759 --> 36:02.893
Okay? Mcgee pinged me
last month,

36:02.895 --> 36:05.529
And I felt violated.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.564
Come on, abby,
you're all I've got.

36:07.566 --> 36:08.598
I suck at this
computer stuff,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.367
And your wonder twin
is at his

36:10.369 --> 36:11.535
Video game geek
social tonight.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.569
That's not till next week.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.337
I need to find her.

36:16.474 --> 36:17.807
I think it has something
to do with bodnar.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.676
I knew it.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.579
I knew that's what
she was up to.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.414
Oh, my god, bodnar...

36:24.416 --> 36:26.683
That's really, really bad.

36:28.452 --> 36:30.253
It's not like I'm
surprised this is happening.

36:30.255 --> 36:32.522
If I could set my clock
to every time mercury messes

36:32.524 --> 36:33.590
With somebody in my life, I'd...

36:33.592 --> 36:38.328
Abby, just tell me
you'll do it.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.963
Of course I'll do it.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.933
(typing)

36:42.935 --> 36:45.435
Tony:
<i>I've got to be getting warm.</i>

36:45.437 --> 36:47.837
I passed four thai restaurants
and two bars on my way here.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.306
Abby:
Not warm, tony.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.674
Red hot.

36:50.676 --> 36:53.210
Now walk 20 feet due north.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.580
I might be a little overdressed
for this place.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.582
Okay... Okay, stop.

36:58.584 --> 36:59.783
Stop, stop, stop.
You got it.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.585
You're the best, abbs.

37:01.587 --> 37:08.692
(ziva speaking
indistinctly, muffled)

37:08.694 --> 37:10.594
(knocking on door,
talking stops)

37:14.599 --> 37:17.300
(locks, latches clicking)

37:22.540 --> 37:24.541
I want to help.

37:25.509 --> 37:27.677
Mcgee:
Is that food?

37:34.518 --> 37:36.019
What are you doing here?

37:36.988 --> 37:39.422
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

37:42.693 --> 37:44.527
Now that the kidnapping
case is over,

37:44.529 --> 37:45.895
We were going
to tell you.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.530
Ziva was just waiting
for the right time.

37:47.532 --> 37:50.600
One phone call led to another,
and then...

37:50.602 --> 37:52.569
And the next thing you
know we're holed up

37:52.571 --> 37:55.438
In this crummy studio, obsessing
about where to go next.

38:05.683 --> 38:07.550
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.685
Matching computers.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.754
I mean, that's...
That's adorable.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.289
It's not funny.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.024
This is serious.

38:14.026 --> 38:15.525
I'm well aware of that, ziva.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.527
You're tracking a cia target

38:17.529 --> 38:19.596
And using ncis resources
to do it.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.665
No, this is all
off the books.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.601
'cause that makes it
ten times worse.

38:24.603 --> 38:28.738
Hmm, it's a nice way
to lose your job, guys.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.607
It's only a matter of time
before word gets out

38:30.609 --> 38:31.741
That you're tracking him
internationally,

38:31.743 --> 38:33.376
If it isn't out already.

38:33.378 --> 38:34.678
Technically,
we're not tracking him.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.379
I have friends
and contacts

38:36.381 --> 38:37.647
Monitoring bank accounts
and airport activity

38:37.649 --> 38:39.749
All around the world.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.818
Shmeil putting in some overtime
for you, huh?

38:41.820 --> 38:44.054
Shmeil is one of
my contacts, tony.

38:44.056 --> 38:46.022
But that is not what matters.

38:48.859 --> 38:50.560
Shortly after
my father's death,

38:50.562 --> 38:52.495
Bodnar was caught
on a surveillance camera

38:52.497 --> 38:55.098
Exiting a dulles airport
parking garage.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.334
25 minutes later,

38:57.336 --> 38:59.669
He was seen leaving a restroom
inside the terminal.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.471
A person matching
his description

39:01.473 --> 39:03.840
Landed at rome's fiumicino
airport the following day.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.876
This is actually one of the last
pictures taken of him,

39:06.878 --> 39:08.712
But there have been
possible sightings

39:08.714 --> 39:12.716
In switzerland and prague
as recently as last week.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.684
We think he's exhausted
all of his fail-safes

39:14.686 --> 39:16.686
And is still hiding out
somewhere in western europe.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.688
Or the cia's already
gotten to him,

39:18.690 --> 39:19.789
He's in custody or dead.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.891
Bodnar's not dead.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.360
He's alive.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.362
And I'm not going to stop
until I find him.

39:27.498 --> 39:30.367
So, when do you plan
on telling gibbs?

39:48.552 --> 39:50.420
What, ziva?

39:53.157 --> 39:56.526
I would like your permission to
travel to europe to find bodnar.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.461
I have been trying
to locate him

39:58.463 --> 40:00.797
With the help of mcgee
and various contacts.

40:00.799 --> 40:03.666
I know.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.568
You have known all this time?

40:05.570 --> 40:07.103
Then why did you not...?

40:07.105 --> 40:09.672
You needed to be
ready to tell me.

40:10.775 --> 40:13.109
He's in rome.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.178
That's what I thought, too.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.880
What are you waiting for?

40:16.882 --> 40:18.481
Take dinozzo.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.817
Go.
