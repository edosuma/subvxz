00:08.939 --> 00:12.081
[bright cheery music]

00:21.021 --> 00:22.712
- Christmas time.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.955
Oh, the snow, the trees,

00:25.059 --> 00:28.511
the little snowman made by
the neighbors down the street.

00:28.614 --> 00:30.306
That's magic.

00:30.409 --> 00:33.067
When snow falls and
creates a whole new world

00:33.171 --> 00:35.621
on top of the world,
we see every day

00:35.725 --> 00:39.073
a beautiful ice-capped
view of beauty.

00:39.177 --> 00:42.352
I'm Holly, and this is
the home I grew up in.

00:42.456 --> 00:44.768
Seems like some of
my greatest memories

00:44.872 --> 00:46.218
are from around Christmas time.

00:47.357 --> 00:50.015
Growing up, Christmas was always

00:50.119 --> 00:51.706
our favorite time of the year.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.778
I mean, my dad's name is Nick,

00:54.882 --> 00:57.850
my mom's name is Joy, and
of course you already know

00:57.954 --> 00:59.404
they named me Holly.

01:01.130 --> 01:04.581
That's why I love us.
And I love Christmas.

01:04.685 --> 01:07.205
I truly believe this
holiday was created

01:07.308 --> 01:09.621
just for us to
spend time together.

01:10.794 --> 01:12.865
And what would Christmas
be without Aunt Rhonda

01:12.969 --> 01:16.006
and my mom's brother, Uncle Joe?

01:16.110 --> 01:18.250
Uncle Joe and Dad would
always get together

01:18.354 --> 01:21.529
and serenade the family
every Christmas at midnight.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.186
The two of them
were just bubbling

01:23.289 --> 01:25.533
with Christmas spirit
when they got together.

01:27.742 --> 01:30.504
One thing my mom
always said about me

01:30.607 --> 01:33.265
was that I was the
perfect matchmaker.

01:34.473 --> 01:36.441
It all started when
my mom's brother Joe

01:36.544 --> 01:39.823
met her childhood best
friend Rhonda one Christmas.

01:39.926 --> 01:43.172
When I saw them together,
something clicked,

01:43.275 --> 01:46.071
and I knew that they were
meant to be together.

01:46.175 --> 01:48.487
Well, just as I
predicted, Uncle Joe

01:48.591 --> 01:50.731
and Aunt Rhonda got married.

01:50.834 --> 01:54.424
And from that point on,
we were inseparable.

01:54.527 --> 01:57.945
Uncle Joe would always talk
about the importance of family

01:58.048 --> 01:59.119
and being together at Christmas

01:59.222 --> 02:01.742
and how we needed each other.

02:01.845 --> 02:05.125
One by one, we would stand in
front of the Christmas tree,

02:05.228 --> 02:07.092
and each person
would tell a story

02:07.196 --> 02:09.025
about our one special ornament

02:09.128 --> 02:12.408
we were placing on it that
year and what it meant to us.

02:12.511 --> 02:14.168
Dad would gather us around

02:14.272 --> 02:16.032
after the grandfather
clock struck

02:16.136 --> 02:19.415
and then begin singing
Christmas carols.

02:19.518 --> 02:22.176
That was true Christmas magic.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.421
[cheery upbeat music]

03:08.360 --> 03:10.983
This Christmas, we are
taking the Holli-Date app

03:11.087 --> 03:12.606
to a whole new level.

03:12.709 --> 03:15.747
By now, I'm pretty sure
you've heard of our number one

03:15.850 --> 03:19.406
matchmaking abilities,
but now we've expanded.

03:19.509 --> 03:22.719
In our new update, you
have different options.

03:22.823 --> 03:25.481
You can sign up to find
your match made in heaven.

03:25.584 --> 03:27.897
Or if you're one of those
people who's not quite ready

03:28.000 --> 03:29.795
to commit and you're just
looking for a partner

03:29.899 --> 03:33.040
for the annual Christmas party,
you can book a holiday date

03:33.143 --> 03:35.249
from one of our
eligible singles.

03:35.353 --> 03:38.942
The matchmaking
possibilities are endless!

03:39.046 --> 03:41.255
- Girl, that was amazing.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.188
- You think so?

03:43.292 --> 03:44.810
- They are gonna eat this up.

03:44.914 --> 03:47.710
This rollout is gonna be the
best thing in the new year.

03:47.813 --> 03:51.438
- Ah, and there is so much
planned for the top of the year.

03:51.541 --> 03:52.749
- You've worked
so hard for this.

03:52.853 --> 03:54.579
- And this is only
the beginning.

03:54.682 --> 03:56.684
- [Dianna] I know. [squeals]

03:56.788 --> 03:59.515
- Okay, do we have anything
else planned for today?

03:59.618 --> 04:00.999
- No, we are in the clear.

04:01.102 --> 04:02.414
What are you doing tonight?

04:02.518 --> 04:04.692
- Uh, probably just
gonna walk around,

04:04.796 --> 04:07.212
take a few pictures,
and then head home.

04:07.316 --> 04:08.903
- Oh, no holiday plans?

04:10.284 --> 04:12.252
- Just gonna curl up on
the couch. [chuckles]

04:12.355 --> 04:13.770
What about you?

04:13.874 --> 04:15.151
- Oh, I'm flying out
tonight to go home.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.565
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

04:16.670 --> 04:17.428
- How exciting.
- Yeah.

04:20.432 --> 04:23.159
- Okay, well you have
a very merry Christmas.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.266
- I will, but let me know
if you need anything, okay?

04:26.369 --> 04:27.336
- I will.

04:29.338 --> 04:31.063
- When are you gonna
get back out there?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.722
- Uh, what do you mean?

04:35.620 --> 04:37.587
- Come on. You know what I mean.

04:37.691 --> 04:40.349
You spend all this time
matchmaking everyone else.

04:40.452 --> 04:42.661
When are you gonna
start matching yourself?

04:42.765 --> 04:44.870
- [laughs] You sound
just like my mother.

04:44.974 --> 04:47.666
Every conversation
we have, she asks,

04:47.770 --> 04:50.255
"When are you gonna
find someone?"

04:50.359 --> 04:51.843
- And?

04:51.946 --> 04:55.847
- And I tell her,
I'm just not looking.

04:57.262 --> 04:57.987
- Mm. Why not?

04:59.885 --> 05:00.748
- It's easier.

05:01.853 --> 05:03.441
- What is?

05:03.544 --> 05:05.684
- Matching other people.

05:05.788 --> 05:09.688
You know the saying, those who
can do, and those who can't-

05:09.792 --> 05:12.381
- Those who can't, not
those who don't try.

05:12.484 --> 05:14.521
- All right, all
right. Get outta here.

05:14.624 --> 05:17.386
Go. Go, go, go, go, go
before you miss your flight.

05:17.489 --> 05:19.595
- Okay. Have a merry Christmas.

05:21.942 --> 05:26.464
[Holly sighs]
[cell phone buzzing]

05:26.567 --> 05:29.052
[Holly sighs]

05:32.159 --> 05:34.679
[Holly sighs]

05:37.440 --> 05:41.824
- Uh, did you just send
me to voicemail again?

05:41.927 --> 05:43.515
- I'm busy.

05:43.619 --> 05:45.897
- No, you aren't. I
was just watching you.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.175
- First of all,
John, that's creepy.

05:48.278 --> 05:50.315
Second of all, I'm
off for the day

05:50.419 --> 05:52.006
and I don't wanna talk
about work anymore.

05:52.110 --> 05:54.008
- But this is important, Holly.

05:54.112 --> 05:55.665
- Well, you're my IT.

05:55.769 --> 05:57.011
Whatever it is, I'm pretty
sure you can figure it out.

05:57.115 --> 05:58.772
- Well, I'm not only your IT.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.601
I bought stocks in
the company, remember?

06:00.705 --> 06:03.570
So currently I am your
second-largest shareholder.

06:03.673 --> 06:06.400
So your success is my success.

06:06.504 --> 06:08.091
- Oh, Lord, please
remind me to buy you out.

06:08.195 --> 06:09.403
- Actually, that's
what I've been meaning

06:09.507 --> 06:10.439
to talk to you about.

06:10.542 --> 06:11.854
I was thinking,

06:12.889 --> 06:14.719
you bring me in as a partner.

06:14.822 --> 06:17.204
You know, being as though I
built the app and everything.

06:17.307 --> 06:19.275
- It's managed by
early innovation,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.484
so why would I bring
you in as a partner?

06:21.588 --> 06:23.659
- Because I actually
have your back, Holly.

06:23.762 --> 06:25.488
You see, I found this
new glitch in the update

06:25.592 --> 06:27.283
that could really put
your users at risk of-

06:27.387 --> 06:29.768
- John, it's Christmas Eve.

06:29.872 --> 06:32.219
Let's talk about this
after the holidays.

06:32.322 --> 06:33.876
- Talk about what?

06:33.979 --> 06:36.396
Our partnership or you
delaying the launch of the app?

06:36.499 --> 06:38.121
- Both.

06:38.225 --> 06:42.125
- So wait, you are actually
considering making me a partner?

06:42.229 --> 06:43.403
- No.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.405
- Then why would you say that?

06:45.508 --> 06:47.648
- I'm just trying to
get you to leave, John.

06:49.547 --> 06:50.651
- You know, Holly,

06:52.170 --> 06:54.655
[sighs] here I am on my
day off trying to help you

06:54.759 --> 06:57.796
and your company, but you're
too busy trying to find love

06:57.900 --> 07:00.109
for everyone else
and matchmaking

07:00.212 --> 07:03.250
that you don't take the
time to fix your own issues.

07:03.353 --> 07:05.217
- What's that supposed to mean?

07:05.321 --> 07:05.977
- Nothing.

07:07.288 --> 07:08.911
We'll just put this
off till later,

07:09.014 --> 07:10.878
'cause that seems like that's
what you do with everything

07:10.982 --> 07:14.606
that doesn't pertain to your
perfect dream world narrative.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.850
- [chuckles] Well,
my dream narrative

07:16.953 --> 07:19.818
is working out just
fine, thank you.

07:19.922 --> 07:22.925
I help millions of
people find happiness.

07:23.028 --> 07:24.513
- Mm-hmm.
- So if you don't mind,

07:24.616 --> 07:26.963
I'll be on my way. [chuckles]

07:27.067 --> 07:28.275
- [John] Holly.

07:28.378 --> 07:29.828
- And who just
pops up on someone

07:29.932 --> 07:31.761
after they decline your call?

07:31.865 --> 07:34.868
- Someone who doesn't wanna
lose their entire stock holding

07:34.971 --> 07:36.801
because of a major
glitch found in an update

07:36.904 --> 07:38.837
that comes out this Christmas.

07:38.941 --> 07:41.702
So I just came over
here to show you

07:41.806 --> 07:43.739
before it went
out to the public.

07:45.913 --> 07:48.640
[phone chimes]
- [gasps] Oh, a comment.

07:48.744 --> 07:51.540
"Hi, Holly, your Holli-Date
app has helped me find

07:51.643 --> 07:53.680
the perfect guy for-"

07:53.783 --> 07:56.821
- Really?
- "Christmas."

07:56.924 --> 07:57.718
Really what?

07:58.926 --> 08:00.583
- I give you the phone
to show you the glitch,

08:00.687 --> 08:02.827
and you go to the
comments section?

08:02.930 --> 08:05.657
- Uh, for your information,
the comments section

08:05.761 --> 08:08.522
is where I find the majority
of my market research.

08:08.626 --> 08:10.041
Thank you very much.

08:10.144 --> 08:11.491
And I already told you,

08:11.594 --> 08:13.147
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

08:13.251 --> 08:17.220
- All right, suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

08:18.256 --> 08:19.188
- You know what, John?

08:19.291 --> 08:20.948
- Know what, Holly?

08:21.052 --> 08:22.916
- Maybe you should use the
app to help you find someone.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.883
Maybe it'll help
you learn to relax

08:24.987 --> 08:27.817
and see the magic
all around you.

08:27.921 --> 08:29.405
- No can do.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.924
- And why is that?

08:31.027 --> 08:33.236
- Because of Holly's
number one rule.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.825
Employees should never
use the app to find love

08:35.929 --> 08:38.828
because it can create
liability issues.

08:38.932 --> 08:41.244
- Well, maybe we should make
an exception in your case,

08:41.347 --> 08:44.489
because you definitely need to
find someone else to bother.

08:44.593 --> 08:48.044
- But I don't mind
bothering you.

08:48.148 --> 08:51.254
You know, 'cause you're the only
other person in the company

08:51.358 --> 08:54.050
who doesn't have anywhere
to go for the holidays.

08:57.088 --> 08:57.882
Aren't I right?

08:59.780 --> 09:01.748
- Goodbye, John.
[John laughs]

09:01.851 --> 09:03.853
- [John] All right, I'm leaving.

09:03.957 --> 09:06.338
- In a way, John
was actually right.

09:06.442 --> 09:07.857
I hadn't been able to experience

09:07.961 --> 09:10.032
the Christmas magic
myself in years.

09:11.896 --> 09:14.312
Uncle Joe passed away
in a car accident.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.315
That seemed to suck the magic

09:17.418 --> 09:19.179
out of Christmas
around our house.

09:20.870 --> 09:23.597
Mom started to find things to
do to keep her mind occupied,

09:23.701 --> 09:25.944
and Aunt Rhonda eventually
stopped coming over.

09:28.119 --> 09:30.397
It seemed that everyone
except me and Dad

09:30.500 --> 09:32.192
had lost the Christmas spirit.

09:35.782 --> 09:38.716
This Christmas, I'm deciding
no matter what it takes,

09:38.819 --> 09:41.822
I am going to use my
amazing matchmaking skills

09:41.926 --> 09:43.824
to bring my family
back together.

09:43.928 --> 09:46.551
But for this plan to work,
the first thing I have to do

09:46.655 --> 09:49.002
is get Aunt Rhonda
to agree to show up.

09:49.105 --> 09:50.831
Hi, Aunt Rhonda.

09:50.935 --> 09:52.937
- Girl, what you do on calling
me first thing this morning?

09:53.040 --> 09:54.904
- Last time you left me
standing at the door,

09:55.008 --> 09:57.493
so I figure calling's better.
[Rhonda chuckles]

09:57.597 --> 09:59.184
Where's Uncle David?

09:59.288 --> 10:00.910
- He's out playing golf.

10:01.014 --> 10:03.741
- Well, you know,
I was thinking,

10:04.914 --> 10:06.433
maybe it's time
for us to celebrate

10:06.536 --> 10:08.366
Christmas together
again this year.

10:08.469 --> 10:10.506
- Girl, you know your mama
don't want me around anymore,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.404
especially not
during the holidays.

10:12.508 --> 10:13.405
- That's not true.

10:14.821 --> 10:18.065
Sh, she told me to call
you to invite you over.

10:18.169 --> 10:21.310
- Oh, really? When,
when she say that?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.381
- Um, last night.

10:24.831 --> 10:27.523
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.215
- Well, why she ain't answer
my phone calls yesterday?

10:30.319 --> 10:33.909
- Because she was
busy in the kitchen.

10:34.979 --> 10:36.843
You know how she is
when she's baking

10:36.946 --> 10:38.707
her famous Christmas cookies.

10:38.810 --> 10:40.087
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

10:41.571 --> 10:43.228
- So you'll come over?

10:43.332 --> 10:46.369
- Well, I mean, if she really
want me there, I'll show up.

10:46.473 --> 10:47.060
- Great.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.890
- All right, bye.

10:49.994 --> 10:51.823
- Now that Aunt Rhonda's in-
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.927 --> 10:53.722

11:56.577 --> 11:59.822
- No, it's not. Everything
is gonna be just fine.

11:59.926 --> 12:01.237
- Hmm.
- Trust me.

12:01.341 --> 12:01.962

12:07.174 --> 12:09.936
What are you all doing here?

12:10.039 --> 12:13.767
- Dad, don't be ridiculous.
We're here for Christmas.

12:13.871 --> 12:15.562
- You are?

12:15.665 --> 12:17.357
- Yep, I knew this
was a bad idea.

Come on, come on. [laughs]

12:23.294 --> 12:26.469
So daughter, uh, did your
mom know you were coming?

12:26.573 --> 12:30.266
- Oh, don't be silly, Dad. Of
course she knows we're coming.

12:32.061 --> 12:34.443
- Well, Nick, I see you
haven't changed a bit.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.032
- Well, no, no, I still love
decorating this old house

12:37.135 --> 12:38.136

- Yeah.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.104

some folks around to enjoy it.

12:45.937 --> 12:48.043

- Oh, she's upstairs doing

12:49.389 --> 12:51.149
some sort of weight
loss challenge.

12:51.253 --> 12:53.358
- Who in the world does
a weight loss challenge

12:53.462 --> 12:55.498

- Well, apparently,

12:55.602 --> 12:57.224
my wife, your sister-in-law.

do pretty much anything

13:46.342 --> 13:47.619
Shouldn't she be at home
with her new husband?

13:47.723 --> 13:49.104
- I knew it.

13:50.277 --> 13:52.107
- Because I told
her you wanted us

13:52.210 --> 13:53.660
all to celebrate
Christmas together.

13:53.763 --> 13:55.731

drag me all the way down here.

wasn't ready for this.

feel like coming around here

14:02.738 --> 14:04.498

what I'm saying at all.

14:07.501 --> 14:08.813
- Well, it must be true,

been around here since,

All that matters is
that we're here now.

So let's come together and
celebrate. It could be fun.

Like life, dating
can be a cruel world.

You have to be willing
to change and adapt

No, no, no. Wait!

all that sound well and good,
but how does he treat you?

15:39.179 --> 15:41.733
- Better than anybody ever has.

15:42.838 --> 15:44.633
He's so smart. He loves to read.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.531
He's always quoting me poetry

15:46.635 --> 15:49.224
and leaving me love letters
when he goes to work.

15:49.327 --> 15:53.711
He's such a gentleman. We
talk on the phone for hours.

else in the world exists.

warn me sooner?

to be a surprise.

get things together.

doesn't celebrate Christmas.

So when I told him about
our family traditions,

16:17.355 --> 16:21.635
he was so excited to
meet everyone, together.

16:21.739 --> 16:24.707
- Mm.
- So, Mom,

16:24.811 --> 16:29.712

Christmas together again?

16:30.610 --> 16:32.681
Just this one time.

16:34.338 --> 16:36.961

don't have a choice.

16:37.065 --> 16:38.618
What do you say, Rhonda?

16:38.721 --> 16:41.034
You wanna stay and help me
put this thing together?

Oh, we know.
- Yeah, we do.

17:10.857 --> 17:13.411
I just don't wanna rush
into anything either.

Rhonda's right.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.207
She knows a lot about rushing.

17:16.310 --> 17:18.278

gonna knock you out.

- Hey, what, what, what, what's,
what's all the commotion?

22:02.942 --> 22:04.909
Your mom and Aunt
Rhonda still arguing?

22:05.013 --> 22:06.911
You see, I'm hiding
out here in the woods.

22:07.015 --> 22:10.881
- There's no need to hide out
here. We are having Christmas.

22:10.984 --> 22:12.538
- Your mom's gonna
have Christmas?

22:12.641 --> 22:14.091
- Yes.
- With Aunt Rhonda?

22:14.194 --> 22:15.541
- Yes! [giggles]

22:15.644 --> 22:18.371
- Wait a minute. How'd
you pull that off?

22:18.475 --> 22:21.823
- Let's just call it
a Christmas miracle.

22:21.926 --> 22:25.344
- A Christmas miracle it
is. Come on, baby girl.

22:25.447 --> 22:27.794
We gotta get this house
together. [laughs]

22:27.898 --> 22:30.866
We're gonna have Christmas.
- Yeah!

22:32.143 --> 22:32.868
- Oh!

22:35.215 --> 22:37.079
Oh, she drives me crazy.

22:40.462 --> 22:42.775
Holly, this rollout
is a bad idea.

22:45.502 --> 22:47.607
Gotta try to warn her
again. I've got to.

22:48.953 --> 22:50.576
- Well, all right.

22:50.679 --> 22:53.544
We don't have much, but I think
we can make it work, right?

22:53.648 --> 22:55.028
- Should we go to the store?

22:55.132 --> 22:56.616
- Oh, no, no. Store's
gonna be a nightmare.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.997
We've just gotta work
with what we got.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.517
- Oh, Christmas,
Christmas with my family.

23:00.620 --> 23:03.002
I'm so happy, happy, happy.

23:03.105 --> 23:05.038
Doesn't this remind
you guys of old times,

23:05.142 --> 23:08.594
you and Aunt Rhonda in the
kitchen, Dad in the TV room.

23:08.697 --> 23:10.699
We're just missing one person.

23:13.322 --> 23:14.496
- Well, we don't have much time.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.084
- Don't ruin your dinner.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.603
- This is my pre-dinner,
and mind your business.

23:17.706 --> 23:18.535
Love you.
- Love you.

23:18.638 --> 23:20.260
[Rhonda laughs]

23:20.364 --> 23:21.469
- And there's a car
in the driveway.

23:21.572 --> 23:22.780
- A car?
- Yeah.

23:22.884 --> 23:24.403
- We aren't-
[Joy and Rhonda gasp]

23:24.506 --> 23:26.577
- [Joy And Rhonda] It's him!
[Holly screams]

23:26.681 --> 23:28.337
- Wait a minute. Him, who?

23:28.441 --> 23:29.684
- Her boyfriend, I think.

23:29.787 --> 23:30.788
- Finally.
- She got a boyfriend?

23:30.892 --> 23:32.134
- Sam or Samson or something.

23:32.238 --> 23:33.619
- Ooh, yes, yes, yes. [laughs]

23:33.722 --> 23:35.068
About time.
- Yeah.

23:35.172 --> 23:39.245
[all laughing]
[knocking]

23:39.348 --> 23:44.181
[tinkling music]
[knocking]

23:45.320 --> 23:47.115
- John, what are you doing...

23:47.218 --> 23:48.944
Well, come on in.

23:49.048 --> 23:50.670
How do you even know
where my parents live?

23:50.774 --> 23:52.120
- Why don't you ever
answer the phone?

23:52.223 --> 23:53.880
- I'm trying to get my
family back together,

23:53.984 --> 23:56.089
and I really don't need you
disturbing me right now.

23:56.193 --> 23:58.920
- Ah, speaking of disturbing,
I saw that you used the app.

23:59.023 --> 24:00.300
- How do you know
I used the app?

24:00.404 --> 24:01.716
- Because I built
the app, Holly.

24:01.819 --> 24:03.890
- Oh.
- So what are you doing?

24:03.994 --> 24:05.409
Because you broke
your number one rule.

24:05.513 --> 24:07.515
- I know, I know.
But I was desperate!

24:07.618 --> 24:08.861
- For what? A date?

24:10.379 --> 24:11.864
- Course not.
- Then what?

24:13.555 --> 24:15.074
- It's complicated.
- Okay.

24:15.177 --> 24:17.214
So help me explain, what
could be so complicated

24:17.317 --> 24:19.941
that you had to use the app?
- Oh, so sorry, sweetheart.

24:20.044 --> 24:22.046
Oh, is this him? Oh, we just
couldn't wait to meet him.

24:22.150 --> 24:25.498
Hi, baby. Oh, he just as
handsome as you described.

24:25.602 --> 24:27.845
- Uh, I am?
- Yeah, yeah, baby.

24:27.949 --> 24:29.537
So come on, tell me a little
bit more about yourself.

24:29.640 --> 24:30.503
I'm her Aunt Rhonda.

24:30.607 --> 24:33.161
[Holly groans]

24:33.264 --> 24:34.438
- Well, nice to meet you,

24:34.542 --> 24:35.957
Ms. Aunt Rhonda.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.510
Now I need you to tell
me all about yourself.

24:37.614 --> 24:39.788
Holly told us a few things,

24:39.892 --> 24:41.894
but I wanna get it
straight from you.

24:41.997 --> 24:43.412
How long you and
Holly been dating?

24:43.516 --> 24:44.690
- Dating?
- Ooh!

24:44.793 --> 24:45.794
- Oh, no, no,
we're- - Aunt Rhonda!

24:46.864 --> 24:48.901
Come on now. We don't
wanna scare him.

24:49.004 --> 24:52.629
- I'm so sorry, sugar.
I was so excited.

24:52.732 --> 24:54.354
You don't ever bring
anybody to the house.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.080
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

24:56.184 --> 24:58.048
I'm not, I don't know what
Holly has told you, but-

24:58.151 --> 24:59.877
- Don't you worry,
she told us nothing

24:59.981 --> 25:01.914
but good things
about you, mm-hmm.

25:02.017 --> 25:03.467
- Oh, really?
- That's it. Yes.

25:03.571 --> 25:06.090
- Oh, you. Come here.

25:06.194 --> 25:09.059
We'll be right back, Auntie.
Right back, hey. [giggles]

25:12.821 --> 25:14.892
Oh. What are you doing?

25:14.996 --> 25:17.446
They don't know I
own a dating app.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.276
- Oh, speaking of, I
need to see your phone.

25:19.379 --> 25:21.105
I gotta delete the app
and roll back the update.

25:21.209 --> 25:23.901
I'm getting some type
of like weird error.

25:24.005 --> 25:25.662
- You can't get
my phone right now

25:25.765 --> 25:28.457
because I have to
track my real date.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.149
So I need you to leave like now.

25:30.252 --> 25:31.944
- Yes.
- Now.

25:32.047 --> 25:34.533
- But I gotta fix the issue.
I always got your back, Holly.

25:34.636 --> 25:36.120
- Is that him?
- Yes, it is.

25:36.224 --> 25:38.744
- As much as I appreciate
you, and I really do,

25:38.847 --> 25:41.298
I'm focusing on trying to get
my family back together, so-

25:41.401 --> 25:43.472
- Do you see how passionately
he talk about her?

25:43.576 --> 25:46.061
- I know, Rhonda.
- Mm-hmm.

25:46.165 --> 25:50.549
- So how about we pick this
up later, like at the office.

25:53.344 --> 25:54.898
- Oh, so you really need a man.

25:55.001 --> 25:59.799
Oh, maybe I just be him, and
then you don't need your phone.

25:59.903 --> 26:02.077
Yes.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:02.181 --> 26:04.045
- Hello, everyone.
You are so beautiful.

26:04.148 --> 26:06.703
I heard so many great
things about you guys.

26:06.806 --> 26:08.601
Yes, my name is J-
- Samson.

26:08.705 --> 26:11.639
We've heard it
already. Santa Samson.

26:11.742 --> 26:12.985
What kind of name
is that, anyway?

26:13.088 --> 26:14.987
- Yeah, yeah,
Santa Samson. Yeah.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.885
Well, actually my name is John.

26:16.989 --> 26:18.542
Look, we like to do
this thing at work

26:18.646 --> 26:20.993
where everyone dresses
up in Santa suits.

26:21.096 --> 26:22.719
And I guess I was
just so handsome

26:22.822 --> 26:25.480
that Holly over here
named me her Santa Samson.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.794
- [Rhonda] Mm-hmm.
[all giggling]

26:28.897 --> 26:30.830
- His name is John.
You can call him John.

26:30.934 --> 26:33.488
Thank you, John.
That's enough, John.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.800
- Well, we'll have
plenty of time

26:34.903 --> 26:36.491
to get to know this
handsome devil.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.527
Right now, we need
to prepare dinner.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.288
- Mm-hmm. Yes, Christmas dinner.

26:40.391 --> 26:42.842
And you are our guest of honor.

26:42.946 --> 26:44.395
- Oh, I never been a
guest of honor before.

26:44.499 --> 26:45.396
- [Rhonda] Mm-hmm.

26:46.915 --> 26:48.123
- Come on, Rhonda.
- Mm-hmm.

26:49.435 --> 26:50.747
You behave yourself,
little girl.

26:50.850 --> 26:52.576
[Holly laughs]

26:52.680 --> 26:54.198
- Why did you do that?

26:54.302 --> 26:55.924
- Because I need to protect
you, and I need your phone.

26:56.028 --> 26:58.271
- I do not need
you to protect me.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.308
- Oh, my. Well, I'm not leaving.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.034
'Cause I'm Santa Samson.

27:02.137 --> 27:04.243
- Well, I am trying to get
my family back together,

27:04.346 --> 27:07.522
so I need you to leave so
that they can fall in love

27:07.626 --> 27:09.179
with the real Santa Samson

27:09.282 --> 27:11.595
and the magic of
Christmas like we used to.

27:11.699 --> 27:13.424
So please, just, just go.

27:13.528 --> 27:15.219
- So sweet.

27:15.323 --> 27:17.877
You should really experience
your Christmas magic.

27:17.981 --> 27:20.086
I really want that for you.

27:20.190 --> 27:22.088
But I'm not leaving
till I wipe your phone.

27:22.192 --> 27:24.539
And besides, it seems
like your family

27:24.643 --> 27:26.955
really likes me,
so there's that.

27:31.546 --> 27:33.099
- Fine.

27:33.203 --> 27:35.515
Follow my lead and help me
get my family back together,

27:35.619 --> 27:37.034
and then you can
take my phone and do

27:37.138 --> 27:39.278
whatever it is that
you need to do with it.

27:40.693 --> 27:44.386
Whatever you do, please do
not mention the dating app.

27:44.490 --> 27:46.388
I don't need my family to
know that you're a fake.

27:46.492 --> 27:48.667
[whimsical music]

27:48.770 --> 27:50.185
- All right.

27:50.289 --> 27:53.672
- Hey, there you are.
So, so is this the guy?

27:53.775 --> 27:56.295
Your mother told me he was here.

27:56.398 --> 27:57.745
Hi, how you doing?

27:57.848 --> 28:00.126
I'm Nick, I'm Holly's
dad. Nice to meet you.

28:00.230 --> 28:01.749
- Well, uh, nice to
meet you too, sir.

28:01.852 --> 28:05.028
- [laughs] Oh. Yeah.

28:06.236 --> 28:07.755
And respectful,
too. I like that.

28:07.858 --> 28:09.411
Holly's been keeping
you a secret.

28:10.550 --> 28:11.690
- You know how she can be.

28:11.793 --> 28:13.277
- Oh, yeah.

28:13.381 --> 28:14.796
Well, listen, I'd love
to sit and talk with you,

28:14.900 --> 28:15.901
get to know you a little better,

28:16.004 --> 28:17.281
but right now I've gotta finish

28:17.385 --> 28:19.318
hanging these lights
out on the porch.

28:19.421 --> 28:20.629
- Oh, I'll get them.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.183
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:22.286 --> 28:24.185
I'll get 'em. You don't
have to do that. [chuckles]

28:24.288 --> 28:25.013
- I insist.

28:28.189 --> 28:30.985
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:31.088 --> 28:34.091
Yeah, seems like a
nice fellow. Huh.

28:40.684 --> 28:42.065
- How's your arm?

28:42.168 --> 28:43.652
- Your dad's kind of strong.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.551
- I know. I'm sorry about that.

28:45.654 --> 28:48.727
- That's cool. So, uh, you
gonna tell me what's up?

28:48.830 --> 28:49.900
- Not really.

28:50.004 --> 28:52.316
- [laughs] Holly.

28:52.420 --> 28:54.663
- Okay, fine. I'm
mad at you, John.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.286
I can't believe you
would put me into this.

28:56.389 --> 28:58.944
- Oh, I've been in way
crazier situations than this.

28:59.047 --> 29:01.222
Is Holly actually
starting to show emotions?

29:02.361 --> 29:03.224
- Whatever.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.123
Okay, so here's the plan.

29:06.227 --> 29:08.608
So basically I had
to explain to John

29:08.712 --> 29:10.610
how Mom and Aunt
Rhonda were at odds

29:10.714 --> 29:12.716
ever since Uncle Joe died.

29:12.820 --> 29:14.545
We all miss Uncle Joe,

29:14.649 --> 29:17.445
and they both just have
different ways of showing it.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.481
But when Aunt Rhonda remarried,

29:19.585 --> 29:23.037
Mom just couldn't forgive
her for how soon it happened.

29:23.140 --> 29:24.728
That just seemed
to suck the life

29:24.832 --> 29:26.972
right out of family Christmas.

29:27.075 --> 29:30.320
So basically John, I
need you to be Uncle Joe.

29:30.423 --> 29:31.666
- Okay.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.564
- Laugh and sing
songs with my dad.

29:33.668 --> 29:36.291
Make Aunt Rhonda feel like
she's a part of the family.

29:36.395 --> 29:38.777
And Mom, just keep telling her
stories and she'll love it.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.675
They'll have so much
fun enjoying you

29:40.779 --> 29:44.955
that they'll remember that
it's not about John or Joe

29:45.059 --> 29:47.889
or any John, it's really
just about sharing

29:47.993 --> 29:50.443
love and family at Christmas.

29:50.547 --> 29:52.135
- Wow. Impressive.

29:52.238 --> 29:54.447
- So can you do it or nah?

29:54.551 --> 29:55.966
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

29:56.070 --> 29:58.935
And plus you'll be
making it up to me.

29:59.659 --> 30:00.799
- Making up what?

30:00.902 --> 30:02.386
- Our first date.

30:02.490 --> 30:05.424
[Holly laughs]

30:05.527 --> 30:06.943
- [Holly] What?

30:07.046 --> 30:08.599
- All right, do you
remember our first date?

30:08.703 --> 30:10.843
We were at the coffee shop,
and I gave you my number,

30:10.947 --> 30:12.880
and when we came back,
you interviewed me

30:12.983 --> 30:15.814
and offered me the job
at your company instead.

30:17.367 --> 30:19.196
- John, you're delusional.
That was not a first date.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.441
When I first met you, you
gave me your business card

30:22.544 --> 30:24.477
and you told me you
developed apps on the side.

30:24.581 --> 30:26.894
Of course I was gonna call
you back for an interview.

30:26.997 --> 30:28.999
- Man, I thought
we had chemistry.

30:29.103 --> 30:31.553
- John, we're like
bleach and ammonia.

30:31.657 --> 30:33.003
We sting when we get together.

30:33.107 --> 30:35.903
- Oh, well, my heart
stings too, Holly.

30:36.006 --> 30:37.905
- Shut up.
[John laughs]

30:38.008 --> 30:40.735
Come on and help me go
grab some more lights

30:40.839 --> 30:43.255
and ornaments and
things, come on!

30:43.358 --> 30:44.497
- You want me to leave
these right here?

30:44.601 --> 30:46.396
- [Holly] Yeah, leave 'em.

30:47.811 --> 30:48.777
Don't you just love
all of the beautiful

30:48.881 --> 30:50.227
colors of Christmas?

30:51.953 --> 30:53.817
The shimmering
lights, the ornaments

30:53.921 --> 30:56.337
as they sparkle
against the evergreen,

30:56.440 --> 30:59.271
the bellows of red that
glisten beneath the mistletoe,

30:59.374 --> 31:03.931
colors of life, of love,
of joy, of Christmas.

31:06.588 --> 31:07.935
- This is, uh, kinda cool.

31:09.177 --> 31:10.420
- What?

31:10.523 --> 31:12.629
- You know, your family
celebrating Christmas.

31:12.732 --> 31:16.805
- Mm-hmm. Your family
doesn't celebrate Christmas?

31:16.909 --> 31:18.946
- Well, it's just my mom and I,

31:19.049 --> 31:21.189
so I never really
had much family.

31:23.053 --> 31:24.296
- You don't see your mom?

31:25.573 --> 31:27.506
- My dad passed away
when I was younger,

31:28.714 --> 31:31.441
so ever since then,
we never celebrate it.

31:31.544 --> 31:32.649
So I just go to work.

31:34.306 --> 31:36.964
And after work, I go out of
town and look at the lights.

31:38.620 --> 31:40.070
- Hmm. Is that right?

31:41.589 --> 31:45.696
- Yeah. It gets kind of lonely
around this time of the year.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.664
- I know how that can be.

31:47.767 --> 31:50.253
- Yeah, just wish I had
like a nice house like this

31:50.356 --> 31:52.772
and a family to really
celebrate the holidays with.

31:52.876 --> 31:55.292
You know?
- Yeah, that's great.

31:56.673 --> 31:57.536
- Whoa.

32:02.265 --> 32:04.474
- I can't believe we doing this.

32:04.577 --> 32:05.820
- Well, leave it to Holly

32:05.924 --> 32:08.409
to get us together
for Christmas again.

32:08.512 --> 32:09.582
- It's been a while.

32:09.686 --> 32:11.895
- Hmm. How have you been?

32:11.999 --> 32:14.277
- You'd know if you
answered your phone.

32:14.380 --> 32:16.486
- How's your
husband? Don, is it?

32:17.694 --> 32:19.282
- You know it's David, Joy.

32:27.117 --> 32:29.948
We used to be best friends, Joy.

32:32.674 --> 32:34.469
- I know, it's just,

32:35.815 --> 32:37.162
when we lost Joe,
I couldn't deal.

32:38.266 --> 32:39.474
- I couldn't deal either.

32:42.339 --> 32:45.032
- Well, you seem to have
just dealt with it fine.

32:45.135 --> 32:46.343
- That just isn't fair.

32:47.517 --> 32:49.933
- What's not fair is the
fact that you decided

32:50.037 --> 32:51.452
to move-
- Hey, look at you two.

32:51.555 --> 32:54.593
[chuckles] Together
again in the kitchen,

did she disappear to?

32:58.355 --> 33:00.116
- Oh, she's getting some
more Christmas decorations.

33:00.219 --> 33:02.049
- More? Oh, we do not
need more decorations.

33:02.152 --> 33:03.912
- Of course we do.

33:04.016 --> 33:07.744
My baby girl is home, my
beloved sister-in-law is here,

33:07.847 --> 33:09.849

celebrate Christmas again.

why I had to use the app.

Why are you laughing?

33:24.450 --> 33:26.763

- Well, I told you
I was desperate.

once we're all together
with our eyes closed

33:39.431 --> 33:42.192
at midnight on Christmas.

33:42.296 --> 33:45.368
We'll open them, and Dad
will have lights strung

33:45.471 --> 33:48.164
all around the room,
and someone will fall

33:48.267 --> 33:51.926
under the mistletoe, and
it'll be Christmas romance

After the holidays.

listen to me, Holly.

wrong with the update.

that we're having a moment,

something about the app?

would I do without you?

question would be,

done without me?

that you were trying

to tell me about this app?

noticed that if you select

something to do

what else to tell you.

40:31.187 --> 40:32.982
- [John] Sorry, I
didn't see you there.

40:33.085 --> 40:35.433
- It's fine. I was
quite enjoying it.

40:35.536 --> 40:36.744
You two look like you
were having a lot of fun.

40:36.848 --> 40:38.366
- [Nick] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.265
- Uh, where is the restroom?

40:40.368 --> 40:42.681
- Um, first door on the left.

40:42.785 --> 40:45.028
- [John] All right. All right.

40:46.789 --> 40:49.067
- Mr. John, Christmas
man. [laughs]

40:49.170 --> 40:50.448
I think you scared him off.

40:50.551 --> 40:52.691
- [laughs] No, Dad, he's fine.

40:52.795 --> 40:54.382
He's just going to the bathroom.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.419
- Yeah, but you know what?
He knows a lot about fishing.

40:56.523 --> 40:57.662
- Oh, that's what
did it for you?

40:57.765 --> 41:00.527
- Mm, pretty much.
[both laugh]

41:02.045 --> 41:05.497
I like that fellow a lot.
That's, that's a good boy.

41:05.601 --> 41:08.258

41:08.362 --> 41:11.158
[Nick laughs]

41:11.261 --> 41:12.746

41:12.849 --> 41:14.506
- Hey, I thought you
were in the bathroom.

41:14.610 --> 41:15.680
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:15.783 --> 41:17.164
And then I wandered into here.

41:17.267 --> 41:19.338
It's your room?
- Yes, it is.

41:19.442 --> 41:21.237
And boys are not allowed.

41:21.340 --> 41:22.721
- Oh, well, it's nice.

41:22.825 --> 41:25.034
And I was just looking
at this. This you?

41:25.137 --> 41:28.071
- Oh, yes, it is.
Wasn't I adorable?

41:29.210 --> 41:32.041
- I mean, a little
funny looking, but eh.

41:33.421 --> 41:35.872
- No, I wasn't. Hater.

41:35.976 --> 41:38.047
- Uh-huh.
[Holly laughs]

41:38.150 --> 41:41.326
Oh. Hmm?
- Oh, that is

41:41.429 --> 41:42.845
my high school
boyfriend, Reggie.

41:42.948 --> 41:44.985
- Oh, Reggie.

41:45.088 --> 41:46.987
He look like he played guitar
or something like that.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.472
[both laughing]

41:49.576 --> 41:51.163
- Oh, and that's my Uncle Joe.

41:51.267 --> 41:52.855
- Aw. Where is he?

41:54.132 --> 41:56.410
- He passed away
a few years ago.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.793
- Oh, um, I'm sorry.
Were you two close?

42:01.657 --> 42:02.623
- Very close.

42:08.284 --> 42:10.873
[John groans]

42:10.976 --> 42:13.876
Very, very close. Mm, mm, mm.

42:14.704 --> 42:15.981
He was my mom's big brother,

42:16.085 --> 42:18.812
and he and my dad
were best friends.

42:20.158 --> 42:21.953
I feel like he was the glue
that held them all together.

42:22.056 --> 42:26.785
- Oh, so that's Aunt
Rhonda's husband.

42:26.889 --> 42:27.717
- Yeah.

42:30.340 --> 42:31.583
My dad wasn't too bad.

42:31.687 --> 42:33.447
- No, no, no. He seems cool.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.104
- Yes, he is the best.

42:35.207 --> 42:37.658
- [laughs] He did tell me
about your ex-boyfriend.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.040
[both laughing]

42:40.143 --> 42:41.697
- No, he didn't!
- Yes, he did.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.802
- Oh, my family
did not like him.

42:43.906 --> 42:45.908
Really?
- Mm-mm.

42:46.011 --> 42:47.875
He and my dad did not get along,

42:47.979 --> 42:50.568
and my mom said he
wasn't husband material.

42:50.671 --> 42:53.087
- Oh. What is husband material?

42:53.191 --> 42:54.295
- You know, apparently
I don't know,

42:54.399 --> 42:55.849
because I don't have one.

42:55.952 --> 42:58.679
- Well, trust me. You'll
have one, one day.

43:01.440 --> 43:02.959
- I don't know about that.

43:03.063 --> 43:05.859
- What? You are the
creator of a major app.

43:05.962 --> 43:07.446
You probably got men lined up

43:07.550 --> 43:08.965
all the way down the street
waiting to take you out.

43:09.069 --> 43:14.039
- Mm, thank you.
But not so much.

43:19.148 --> 43:20.459
- Okay, you better
stop looking at me

43:20.563 --> 43:21.978
with those pretty brown eyes.

43:22.082 --> 43:24.049
- Oh, so you do like my eyes?

43:24.153 --> 43:25.948
- [Holly] No, it,
they look like-

43:26.051 --> 43:28.191
- Nah, it's probably because
I wear those blue ray glasses

43:28.295 --> 43:30.608
when I'm over here coding and
looking at different computers

43:30.711 --> 43:32.264
at the same time.

43:32.368 --> 43:34.646
You know, IT things. You
wouldn't know about all that.

see what everybody's up to.

43:45.001 --> 43:46.658
You can't take
pictures, not one bit.

43:46.762 --> 43:49.903
- No, no, no, I'm not. You're
in charge of the pictures now.

43:50.800 --> 43:52.940
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

43:53.044 --> 43:56.047
- Uh, there's, uh
someone here to see you.

43:56.150 --> 43:58.912
They're in the, in
the dining room.

43:59.015 --> 44:00.707
- Who?

44:00.810 --> 44:02.709
- Well, I don't know,
but he said his name was-

44:02.812 --> 44:05.297
- [Joy And Rhonda] Santa Samson.

44:05.401 --> 44:08.611
[Holly gasps]

44:08.715 --> 44:10.440
- I thought you
were Santa Samson.

44:10.544 --> 44:11.649
- Uh, yeah.

44:14.479 --> 44:16.136
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:16.239 --> 44:19.104
I'm so sorry I'm late. This
holiday traffic was horrible.

44:20.968 --> 44:24.316
Wow, yeah, you have a
beautiful home here.

44:24.420 --> 44:25.973
I love the decorations.

44:26.077 --> 44:27.906
- This is my parents' place.

44:28.010 --> 44:29.770
- Wow, the app said
that you were looking

44:29.874 --> 44:32.014
for a holiday date, so I'm here.

44:33.153 --> 44:35.742
- Yeah, you're
here. Yes, you are.

44:37.295 --> 44:38.814
I am so sorry.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.231
Um, there has been a
bit of a mix up and-

44:42.334 --> 44:44.820
- Holly, what's going on?
- Yeah, Holly.

44:44.923 --> 44:46.200
What's going on?
- Who is this?

44:46.304 --> 44:47.443
- Hello, everyone.
I'm Santa Samson.

44:47.546 --> 44:49.100
I'm here for Holly.

44:49.203 --> 44:51.447
- I thought John
was Santa Samson.

44:51.550 --> 44:52.690
- Who's John?

44:52.793 --> 44:55.796
- Uh, uh, hello, everyone.

44:55.900 --> 44:58.281
This is Santa
Samson, my boyfriend.

44:59.938 --> 45:02.044
- If that's Holly's
boyfriend, then who is this?

45:02.147 --> 45:03.770
- Who is John?
- That's-

45:03.873 --> 45:05.012
- I've only had a couple
of beers, and I'm confused.

45:05.116 --> 45:06.565
- You said he was
your boyfriend.

45:06.669 --> 45:07.808
- I never said he
was my boyfriend.

45:07.912 --> 45:09.707
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

45:09.810 --> 45:11.536
- Didn't you say you
were her boyfriend?

45:11.639 --> 45:13.296
- No. I don't think so.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.265
- Uh, no, no, I'm pretty sure
he said he was her boyfriend.

45:16.368 --> 45:19.544
- Someone said that
he was her boyfriend.

45:19.647 --> 45:21.166

45:21.270 --> 45:24.480
if things are starting to
go bad, switch things up!

45:24.583 --> 45:28.035
- So is he your boyfriend?
Am I at the right house?

45:28.139 --> 45:31.867
- He is not my boyfriend.
He is my boyfriend.

45:31.970 --> 45:33.351
- Then what are you doing here?

45:33.454 --> 45:35.802
- I came to talk to
Holly because we haven't-

45:35.905 --> 45:37.838
- John, don't. John.

45:37.942 --> 45:39.978
Oh, will you excuse me?

45:40.082 --> 45:42.360
We've got some work
stuff to discuss.

45:43.671 --> 45:45.052
Quick.
- Right, right. Work stuff.

45:45.156 --> 45:46.674

- We wouldn't have-
- You can't tell them.

45:48.262 --> 45:49.712
- We wouldn't have
even been in this mess

45:49.816 --> 45:51.196
if you would've
given me your phone.

45:51.300 --> 45:52.819
I could've canceled it.
- No, we wouldn't even be

45:52.922 --> 45:54.372
in this mess if you
hadn't come over here

45:54.475 --> 45:55.649
in the first place, now
it's time for you to leave

45:55.753 --> 45:56.512

Honey, you know we
talked about this,

46:00.688 --> 46:03.243
and I asked you don't be late.

46:03.346 --> 46:04.175
- I'm sorry, babe.

46:05.693 --> 46:06.867
- What am I gonna do with you?

46:06.971 --> 46:08.627
- Anything you want.
[Holly giggles]

46:08.731 --> 46:10.802

John, for coming over.

46:17.326 --> 46:18.534

- Yes, thank you, John,
so much, for coming over.

46:24.505 --> 46:28.371
- Uh, sure. [giggles]
I'll be right back.

46:28.475 --> 46:31.443

Sam company for me.

nice to meet you, Sam.

gonna end well, Holly.

up, and I've gotta do

whatever it takes to
get them back together.

- But don't you think

46:59.471 --> 47:01.025
this is a little crazy?

47:01.128 --> 47:02.889
You should just go in there
and tell your family the truth.

47:02.992 --> 47:05.029
- And I will, but not now.

47:05.132 --> 47:07.410
Not until we celebrate
Christmas as a family.

47:07.514 --> 47:09.033

to tell you something.

- No, it's...

47:12.001 --> 47:13.382
Never mind.

something to say, just say it.

- I'm watching you two.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:54.405 --> 49:55.682
You keep mixing it, baby.

50:05.140 --> 50:06.865
- Hey, look, I know you're
with family and all,

50:06.969 --> 50:08.488
but I just wanted
to call and check in

50:08.591 --> 50:09.627
and see if everything
is still good for tomorrow.

50:09.730 --> 50:10.766
- With what?

50:12.112 --> 50:13.941
- What do you mean with
what? With the app.

50:14.045 --> 50:17.393
- Oh, right, the app.
Yes, we're all good.

50:17.497 --> 50:18.532
- Are you okay?

50:19.740 --> 50:21.087
- Yeah. I'm fine.

50:22.398 --> 50:24.297
Dianna, do you really
think we're ready

50:24.400 --> 50:26.713
for this new update and rollout?

50:26.816 --> 50:28.335
- Of course we're ready.

50:28.439 --> 50:31.131
You've worked very hard on
this, and people can't wait.

50:31.235 --> 50:32.615
Are you getting cold feet on me?

50:32.719 --> 50:36.861
- No, no. It's just
something John said.

50:36.964 --> 50:38.966
- John, the IT guy?

50:39.070 --> 50:40.796
- Yeah, he said
something might be wrong

50:40.899 --> 50:43.109
with the duplicate errors.

50:43.212 --> 50:47.078
- Oh, look, we tested
this app a hundred times.

50:47.182 --> 50:50.047
It's good. In fact,
it's better than good.

50:50.150 --> 50:52.359
Literally everyone is
gonna be on it tomorrow

50:52.463 --> 50:56.018
finding their Christmas
Holli-Dates. You
should be proud.

50:56.122 --> 50:58.227
- No, I am. I am.

50:58.331 --> 51:00.954
[sighs] I guess
I'm just nervous.

51:01.058 --> 51:02.852
- Well, shake it off
and get ready, girl.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.890
- You're right.

51:05.993 --> 51:09.583
I've just got so much going on
with my family and Christmas.

51:09.687 --> 51:11.413
- Yeah, oh, oh,
and don't forget,

51:11.516 --> 51:13.725
you have a virtual interview
right before the launch.

51:13.829 --> 51:15.210
I emailed you all the details.

51:15.313 --> 51:17.419
- Yes. Got it.
- Okay.

51:17.522 --> 51:19.076
All right, well, I'll let you
go. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

51:19.179 --> 51:19.800
- Ciao.

51:24.736 --> 51:27.981
[upbeat music]

51:28.085 --> 51:30.017
- Hello, Holly,
it's Christmas Eve

51:30.121 --> 51:32.434
and I'm in the office
trying to help you out.

51:33.435 --> 51:35.678
But you know what, nah.

51:37.094 --> 51:39.820
I'm not doing it,
I'm done. I am done.

51:42.789 --> 51:46.103
[lips burbling]

51:46.206 --> 51:48.519
Ugh, she drives me so crazy.

51:51.246 --> 51:53.627
[John sighs]

51:57.976 --> 52:01.290
- [sighs] Where's Sam?

52:01.394 --> 52:02.360
- I kicked him out.

52:03.534 --> 52:05.122
- Mm. Why?

52:05.225 --> 52:06.882
- Because he spilled
flour all over the floor.

52:06.985 --> 52:08.815
- I think he's preparing for
the light show with your dad.

52:08.918 --> 52:11.438
- [Joy And Rhonda] Uh-uh!

52:11.542 --> 52:12.750
- Do you guys need any help?

52:12.853 --> 52:14.096
- Mm-mm. Got it covered now.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.442
- Yeah, your Aunt Rhonda

52:15.546 --> 52:16.995
finally decided to help.
- You listen.

52:17.099 --> 52:18.376
- You know what?
- I'm sick of you.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.791
- I think you have
something on your mind.

52:19.895 --> 52:22.346
- No, I'm okay. Just
thinking about work.

52:22.449 --> 52:24.071
I need to focus on you two.

52:24.175 --> 52:25.935
- Is everything okay?

52:26.039 --> 52:27.144
- Yeah.

52:27.247 --> 52:28.524
- You know what?
- I think so.

52:28.628 --> 52:30.975
- I like that little
John boy. He nice.

52:31.078 --> 52:34.254
- He is.
- Really nice. Charming.

52:34.358 --> 52:35.428
- That's the guy
you should be with.

52:35.531 --> 52:37.326
- Mm-hmm.
- Husband material.

52:38.258 --> 52:39.708
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

52:39.811 --> 52:42.504
- Definitely. So what was
the deal with all that?

52:43.746 --> 52:44.506
- The deal with what?

52:44.609 --> 52:46.784
- The whole boyfriend thing?

52:46.887 --> 52:49.338
- Nothing. He just came
over to talk about work.

52:49.442 --> 52:52.548
- And to keep you company
until your boyfriend showed up?

52:52.652 --> 52:54.481
- Yeah. What's wrong
with that, Mom?

52:54.585 --> 52:56.103
- Nothing, I just think he's

52:56.207 --> 52:57.312
a little bit more than a friend.

52:57.415 --> 52:59.624
- Definitely more than a friend.

52:59.728 --> 53:00.867
- Well, he's not.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.559
- [Rhonda] Hmm.

53:03.663 --> 53:05.182
- I'm gonna go check on Sam.

53:05.285 --> 53:05.906
- [Joy] Okay.

53:07.529 --> 53:09.013
- She lying.
- Up to no good.

53:09.116 --> 53:11.360
- But that Sam though.
- Mm.

53:11.464 --> 53:13.017
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

53:13.120 --> 53:14.260
- [Rhonda] Oh!

53:16.158 --> 53:18.540
- So Holly tells me you're
a fisherman, hey, buddy?

53:18.643 --> 53:20.335
- Yeah. Sure thing, Nick.

53:20.438 --> 53:23.821
- All right, so then tell
me, what direction is best?

53:23.924 --> 53:25.236
- [Sam] What do you mean?

53:25.340 --> 53:26.237
- What direction is
best for a fisher?

53:26.341 --> 53:29.516
- Oh, uh, east.
- East?

53:29.620 --> 53:30.931
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

53:31.035 --> 53:32.416
- Hey, guys. How's it going?

53:32.519 --> 53:35.833
- Hey, we're
getting it. I think.

53:36.730 --> 53:38.698
- Oh. That's wonderful, baby.

53:38.801 --> 53:40.803
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So what are you doing?

53:42.115 --> 53:44.082
- Oh, Mom and Aunt Rhonda
were all good in the kitchen,

53:44.186 --> 53:45.532
so I thought I'd
come out here and see

53:45.636 --> 53:48.155
what you two boys were
talking about. [laughs]

53:48.259 --> 53:50.434
- Okay, okay. Uh, where's John?

53:50.537 --> 53:52.850
- Who? Oh, John.

53:54.265 --> 53:56.578
He had to leave.
- Oh, oh. That's too bad.

53:56.681 --> 53:59.857
I liked him.
- What is this, his fan club?

53:59.960 --> 54:02.377
- So listen, I'm getting
a little thirsty.

54:02.480 --> 54:04.137
I'm gonna go in and get
myself another beer.

54:04.241 --> 54:07.451
And you know what, maybe later
we can play charades, huh?

54:07.554 --> 54:09.453
- Oh, yay!
- Charades?

54:09.556 --> 54:11.558
Babe, what's charades?

54:13.836 --> 54:14.837
- Seriously?

54:20.567 --> 54:23.432
- [giggles] Yeah, um, oh,

54:23.536 --> 54:25.814
these are some of
our family ornaments.

54:25.917 --> 54:27.816
We have had a lot of
these since I was a kid.

54:27.919 --> 54:28.817
You wanna see some?

54:28.920 --> 54:30.059
- Uh, sure.
- Yay!

54:32.959 --> 54:36.652
- Oh, I made this one when
I was in the second grade.

54:36.756 --> 54:37.584
It was-

54:40.725 --> 54:41.968
- [Sam] Nice.

54:42.071 --> 54:44.729
- Oh, my gosh, look at
this one. Glitter fest.

54:44.833 --> 54:47.076
I think I used too much
glitter on this one,

54:47.180 --> 54:48.871
but it's my favorite!

54:48.975 --> 54:51.840
- Yeah, that's,
that's nice, babe.

54:55.430 --> 54:56.948
[Holly chuckles]

54:57.052 --> 54:59.675
[gentle music]

55:07.269 --> 55:09.236
- I see you and Sam
are getting along.

55:09.340 --> 55:10.928
- Eh, he's all right.

55:11.031 --> 55:13.827
He doesn't really know anything
about fishing or charades.

55:14.587 --> 55:16.105
You know, I like that John.

55:17.210 --> 55:18.384
I bet he'd be good at charades.

55:18.487 --> 55:19.557
- So do I.

55:20.731 --> 55:21.801
- Yeah, I don't
know about that Sam.

55:21.904 --> 55:22.974
- What do you mean?

55:23.078 --> 55:25.149
Weren't you admiring
his mixing skills?

55:25.252 --> 55:26.668
- Yes, I was, but
it's kind of weird

55:26.771 --> 55:28.842
how he showed up out nowhere.

55:28.946 --> 55:31.397
- Well, Holly says that
Sam is her boyfriend.

55:31.500 --> 55:32.708
- Hm-mm, and you believe that?

55:32.812 --> 55:34.331
- Well, why would Holly lie?

55:34.434 --> 55:35.780
- I don't know, but
something isn't right.

55:35.884 --> 55:37.541
- I'm with Rhonda.
Something is off.

55:37.644 --> 55:38.818
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I think

55:38.921 --> 55:40.509
John is our guy.

55:40.613 --> 55:42.891
- You know, I'd be proud to
see him date our daughter.

55:42.994 --> 55:44.996
- Yeah, I know he
wasn't here long,

55:45.100 --> 55:46.584
but he'd be perfect for her.

55:46.688 --> 55:48.414
- Mm-hmm.
- A mother knows.

55:48.517 --> 55:50.001
- It's like he balanced her out.

55:50.105 --> 55:51.865
- That's what it was.
- That's it. Mm-hmm.

55:51.969 --> 55:55.490
- That Sam, I don't
care for him at all.

55:55.593 --> 55:57.699
- Mm-mm. He drink too much.

55:57.802 --> 55:59.528
- Come on, come on. Where is it?

56:02.566 --> 56:04.533
It's gotta be here somewhere.

56:04.637 --> 56:07.467
It's probably in the
dating options. Let's see.

56:09.573 --> 56:14.578
[gasps] Wow, there it
is. There's the glitch.

56:17.857 --> 56:19.065
Oh. Oh, no.

56:21.239 --> 56:23.034
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

56:32.630 --> 56:35.184
[bright music]

56:41.328 --> 56:42.882
- Not my best work.

56:42.985 --> 56:45.160
[Sam laughs]

56:47.369 --> 56:49.267
Wanna see some family photos?

56:49.371 --> 56:49.992
- Yeah, sure.

56:53.306 --> 56:53.962
- Okay. Let's see.

56:55.653 --> 56:59.485
Oh! This is my first Christmas.

56:59.588 --> 57:01.418
Look how big this dress is.

57:01.521 --> 57:04.973
Why would my mom put
me in such a big dress?

57:05.076 --> 57:07.665
[both chuckle]

57:14.051 --> 57:17.468
[cell phone ringing]

57:17.572 --> 57:18.849
[sighs] What is
it, you have more

57:18.952 --> 57:20.851
insulting things to say to me?

57:20.954 --> 57:22.818
- The glitch. I
figured out the issue.

57:22.922 --> 57:25.062
- What is it?
- Okay. Okay.

57:25.165 --> 57:26.719
It's a lot to explain, okay?

57:26.822 --> 57:28.962
- Well, try.
- Okay, so-

57:30.067 --> 57:32.725
[indistinct
background chattering]

57:32.828 --> 57:34.036
Are you listening to me?

57:34.140 --> 57:37.143
- Yeah, I'm listening.
Coming, Dad!

57:37.246 --> 57:40.387
- Holly! Holly, Holly!

57:40.491 --> 57:41.803
- John, speak Ingles.

57:42.907 --> 57:45.565
- Okay, so there were
some brackets missing

57:45.669 --> 57:47.325
between rows on the
submit button code,

57:47.429 --> 57:50.570
so it caused numerous records
to be updated when clicked.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.609
- Hi, I'm Samson.
I'm here for Holly.

57:54.712 --> 57:56.887
- John, I gotta go.
- No, no, Holly, no, no.

57:58.233 --> 57:59.061
- These are for you.

58:00.269 --> 58:01.788
- Uh, who are you?

58:02.686 --> 58:03.997
- Well, that's the Holli-Date.

58:04.101 --> 58:05.723
- Holli-Date,
what's a Holli-Date?

58:05.827 --> 58:07.276
- It's a dating app.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.762
- Wait a minute.
How did we match?

58:09.865 --> 58:11.108
- You said you needed a
date for the holidays.

58:11.211 --> 58:12.385
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.

58:12.489 --> 58:13.731
Why you need a date
for the holidays

58:13.835 --> 58:15.077
if your boyfriend's
already here?

58:15.181 --> 58:16.700
- Boyfriend, why do
you even need a date

58:16.803 --> 58:18.218
if you already have a boyfriend?

58:18.322 --> 58:21.601
- Um, that's a good question.

58:21.705 --> 58:24.293
- I'm Samson. Uh,
I'm here for Holly.

58:27.124 --> 58:28.953
[Holly giggles]

58:29.057 --> 58:30.886
- Holly. Holly!

58:35.650 --> 58:38.894
I cannot believe her. Oh.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.143
- Hey, babe.

58:48.317 --> 58:49.698
- I think he's talking to you.

58:50.975 --> 58:52.080
- Yes, honey?

58:52.183 --> 58:53.875
- Is it all right if
I grab another beer?

58:53.978 --> 58:55.255
- Sure.

58:55.359 --> 58:56.187
- Honey?

58:57.534 --> 58:58.983
- Apparently she
has a boyfriend.

58:59.087 --> 59:00.606
- A boyfriend, your
profile didn't say anything

59:00.709 --> 59:01.986
about you having a boyfriend.

59:02.090 --> 59:03.401
- Well, why would
she put that on there

59:03.505 --> 59:04.817
if she was looking for dates?

59:04.920 --> 59:06.784
- That's true.
- I'm not looking for dates.

59:06.888 --> 59:08.614
I was looking for a date.

59:08.717 --> 59:10.512
- But you have a boyfriend.

59:10.616 --> 59:12.031
- So you do have a boyfriend.

59:13.411 --> 59:16.380
- Dad, can you go to the
kitchen and let me handle this?

59:16.483 --> 59:18.209
- That's your dad?

59:18.313 --> 59:19.832
- I'm really confused.

59:21.454 --> 59:22.317
- Join the club, man.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.773
- [Nick] Hey, hey,
something weird is going on.

59:29.876 --> 59:31.429
- What are you talking about?

59:31.533 --> 59:33.949
- There are two guys here
claiming to be Holly's dates.

59:34.053 --> 59:35.813
- Dates?
- Yeah, said they matched

59:35.917 --> 59:38.816
with her on some
Holli-Date dating app.

59:38.920 --> 59:40.404
- What is going
on with that girl?

59:40.507 --> 59:41.854
- That's what I'm screaming.

59:41.957 --> 59:43.338
I know she's cute and
everything, but mm,

59:43.441 --> 59:44.719
you know what I'm saying?

59:45.754 --> 59:46.859
Two of 'em.
- Mm.

59:48.136 --> 59:49.482
- And them boys, they
kind of funny looking too,

59:49.586 --> 59:50.690
that's what I'm saying here.

59:50.794 --> 59:52.381
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, my.

59:53.728 --> 59:56.903
[cell phone ringing]

59:59.665 --> 01:00:01.528
- Hello?
- [panting] Dianna?

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:03.496
- [Dianna] Hey, what's up?

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.532
- I wish I was
anywhere but here.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:07.120
- [Dianna] Why?

01:00:07.224 --> 01:00:10.745
- Dianna, listen. The
app has gone crazy.

01:00:10.848 --> 01:00:12.816
- What do you mean,
the app has gone crazy?

01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:14.887
- I used the app.

01:00:16.233 --> 01:00:19.305
- Wait, you, you, what do
you mean, you used the app?

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:21.997
- I was just trying to get
my family back together

01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:23.999
for the holidays
so that we could

01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:26.484
celebrate Christmas together.

01:00:26.588 --> 01:00:29.211
I told them I had a boyfriend
and they were so excited,

01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:32.145
so I used the app,
and I chose the option

01:00:32.249 --> 01:00:34.044
to choose a date
for the holidays,

01:00:34.147 --> 01:00:36.460
but somehow it matched
me with multiple dates,

01:00:36.563 --> 01:00:38.635
and they're all here.

01:00:38.738 --> 01:00:40.498
- Wait, they're all where?

01:00:40.602 --> 01:00:42.915
- Here, Dianna, at
my parents' house.

01:00:44.192 --> 01:00:47.333
- Wait, wait, how, how
many matches are there?

01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:49.680
- Like, too many.

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:53.753
- Wait. Okay, hold on, wait.

01:00:53.857 --> 01:00:56.514
It's only supposed
to send one guy.

01:00:56.618 --> 01:00:58.689
- Yes, Dianna, I know. I know.

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:01.174
John!
- What about him?

01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:03.038
- John tried to tell
me there was something

01:01:03.142 --> 01:01:05.558
wrong with the new app update,
and I did listen to him!

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.664
- Why not?
- Because this is going be

01:01:07.767 --> 01:01:09.458
the most used dating
app this Christmas!

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.047
- Well, what are
you waiting for?

01:01:12.151 --> 01:01:13.670
Call John and tell
him to fix it.

01:01:13.773 --> 01:01:15.879
- Right, I'll call
John. He'll fix it.

01:01:15.982 --> 01:01:18.053
I'll call you back.
- Okay, let me know, Holly.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.194
[phone dialing]
[phone ringing]

01:01:21.298 --> 01:01:24.404
- Okay, I can do this.
John will fix it.

01:01:24.508 --> 01:01:26.924
[cheery music]

01:01:27.994 --> 01:01:31.308
[indistinct chattering]

01:01:40.627 --> 01:01:42.008
This is crazy! [gasps]

01:01:42.112 --> 01:01:44.079
This is crazy. It's
like really crazy.

01:01:44.183 --> 01:01:47.945
And you look crazy,
so, um, okay,

01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:50.292
there has been a huge mistake.

01:01:50.396 --> 01:01:52.916
All of you are not
supposed to be here.

01:01:53.019 --> 01:01:57.368
Long story, I used my
dating app to book a date,

01:01:57.472 --> 01:02:00.820
but there was a glitch, and
it matched me with all of you.

01:02:00.924 --> 01:02:03.961
- [Joy] So wait, you
own the Holli-Date app?

01:02:04.065 --> 01:02:05.618
- Yes.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.276
- And you lied about
having a boyfriend?

01:02:08.379 --> 01:02:09.587
- Yes.

01:02:09.691 --> 01:02:10.830
- And you made me
leave my husband

01:02:10.934 --> 01:02:12.867
to come meet your
fake boyfriend?

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:14.109
- Yes.
- Girl.

01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:18.286
- I really appreciate all
of you for coming over.

01:02:18.389 --> 01:02:22.186
The flowers are really
nice. And the gift.

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:26.915
But I won't be needing
a date anymore.

01:02:27.882 --> 01:02:30.401
- Holly, what about me?

01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:35.544
- Yes, you too, Sam. But
thank you for coming.

01:02:37.236 --> 01:02:42.172
So yes, the exit is that way

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.658
and, uh, you can head
towards the door now.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.109
- I am so lost. Troy,
let me get a ride.

01:02:48.212 --> 01:02:49.835
- I don't even know you.
- Not a chance, Cliff.

01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:51.215
- Happy New Year!

01:02:51.319 --> 01:02:53.114
- Rule number six.
- Merry Christmas.

01:02:53.217 --> 01:02:54.701
- [Holly Voiceover] It's okay
when a match doesn't work.

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.151
It's not the end of the world,

01:02:56.255 --> 01:02:58.153
and they're not all
gonna be winners.

01:02:58.257 --> 01:03:01.156
But never take
yourself out the game.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.917
Your perfect match
is on its way.

01:03:05.195 --> 01:03:07.922
- I'm Santa Samson.
I'm here for Holly.

01:03:12.098 --> 01:03:17.103
[door squeaks]
[dramatic music]

01:03:21.452 --> 01:03:24.559
[gentle piano music]

01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:28.183
[Holly sobbing]

01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:31.566
- Holly, why did you lie?

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:37.744
- Do you wanna know why I
lied? Because of all of you.

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:40.506
- Because of us?
- Yes.

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:42.784
Christmas used to be my
favorite time of year.

01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:44.475
I couldn't wait.

01:03:44.579 --> 01:03:47.306
Then Uncle Joe died, and instead
of us celebrating his life

01:03:47.409 --> 01:03:50.930
and his favorite holiday,
you all stopped believing

01:03:51.034 --> 01:03:53.105
in the magic, you
stopped being a family.

01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:57.868
- [Joy] Well, Holly, the
holidays can be hard.

01:03:57.972 --> 01:04:00.595
- Mom, I know. They're
hard on me, too.

01:04:02.148 --> 01:04:04.944
- But sweetheart, that
doesn't explain why you lied.

01:04:06.704 --> 01:04:09.190
- Mom and Aunt Rhonda
weren't even going to agree

01:04:09.293 --> 01:04:13.021
to do Christmas until I
mentioned I was dating someone.

01:04:13.125 --> 01:04:17.888
And I just went with it,
and it just got outta hand.

01:04:17.992 --> 01:04:19.959
- [Joy] But you could've
told us the truth.

01:04:20.718 --> 01:04:23.894
- Could I? [scoffs]

01:04:23.998 --> 01:04:27.864
Look at this. Look
at these ornaments.

01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:29.106
- Holly.
- We don't even

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:30.211
hang these anymore.

01:04:30.314 --> 01:04:31.868
I don't even know why y'all even

01:04:31.971 --> 01:04:33.524
put up a Christmas
tree this year.

01:04:33.628 --> 01:04:35.009
- Holly.
- Careful, Holly.

01:04:35.112 --> 01:04:36.458
- Calm down.
- That's my favorite ornament.

01:04:36.562 --> 01:04:38.219
- Oh, it's your favorite?

01:04:38.322 --> 01:04:40.946
You don't care. This
doesn't matter to you.

01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:42.602
- Holly, calm down.
- It doesn't matter to you.

01:04:42.706 --> 01:04:45.226
It doesn't matter to you. It
doesn't even matter to you.

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:50.127
I will not calm down,
Mom. I will not calm down!

01:04:50.231 --> 01:04:52.889
I just wanted us to be
back together again.

01:04:52.992 --> 01:04:55.374
Aunt Rhonda wasn't
even gonna come over!

01:04:57.376 --> 01:04:59.826
It's like we're not
even a family anymore!

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.312
- Holly!
[glass shatters]

01:05:03.623 --> 01:05:06.454
[melancholy music]

01:05:07.765 --> 01:05:10.113
- Dad, I'm so sorry.

01:05:10.216 --> 01:05:14.600
This is what happens when
I break my own rules.

01:05:16.602 --> 01:05:19.743
I created a huge mess.
[cell phone buzzing]

01:05:19.846 --> 01:05:23.091
- Hello?
- Have you seen the comments?

01:05:23.195 --> 01:05:25.956
- What comments.
- Are you crying?

01:05:28.131 --> 01:05:30.547
- No, no, I'm fine. What's up?

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:32.859
- The comments on our social
media pages are not good.

01:05:32.963 --> 01:05:35.552
Everyone is talking about the
glitch with the new update.

01:05:36.898 --> 01:05:40.315
- That can't even be possible.

01:05:40.419 --> 01:05:43.042
The new update doesn't even
come out until tomorrow.

01:05:43.146 --> 01:05:44.941
- Well, somehow it got leaked.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:51.257
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no. This can't be happening.

01:05:53.121 --> 01:05:54.951
This is all my fault.

01:05:56.262 --> 01:06:00.059
- What is?
- [sobs] Everything.

01:06:00.163 --> 01:06:03.649
I lied to my family.
The app is a disaster.

01:06:05.513 --> 01:06:08.654
I just had a zillion
guys in my house.

01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:11.105
- Oh, you know, Holly,
look, stop crying, okay?

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:13.521
It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not.

01:06:15.626 --> 01:06:18.284
I just wanted to get my
family back together.

01:06:20.562 --> 01:06:24.946
How am I supposed to
be a matchmaker with
a matchmaking app,

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:27.776
and I can't even
match my own family?

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.781
[somber piano music]
[Holly sighs]

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:37.786
This is why I'm never
going to find anyone.

01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:40.997
[somber piano music]

01:06:42.619 --> 01:06:45.242
- Okay. So that's
the real issue.

01:06:46.485 --> 01:06:48.004
Do you really believe that?

01:06:50.178 --> 01:06:53.423
- Well, here I am,
another holiday alone.

01:06:55.597 --> 01:06:58.014
Maybe I'm just not
meant to be with anyone.

01:07:00.499 --> 01:07:02.811
Maybe I don't deserve love.

01:07:05.297 --> 01:07:07.989
- That's not true. I mean,
everyone deserves love.

01:07:08.093 --> 01:07:09.439
It's literally the first thing

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.234
that you see on the
app when you open it.

01:07:12.718 --> 01:07:15.583
- After my breakup with
Kevin, I just pushed away

01:07:15.686 --> 01:07:17.654
every guy that tried
to get close to me.

01:07:19.587 --> 01:07:21.761
I'm just so afraid
they'll hurt me.

01:07:24.626 --> 01:07:25.834
- Maybe that's why you
and John don't get along.

01:07:25.938 --> 01:07:27.526
- Huh?
- Nothing.

01:07:27.629 --> 01:07:29.907
Uh, speaking of John, have
you heard back from him yet?

01:07:30.011 --> 01:07:32.117
- No, and I really
need to talk to him.

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:34.809
I'll call you back.

01:07:35.948 --> 01:07:39.814
[phone dialing]
[phone ringing]

01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:41.333
John, where are you?

01:07:43.266 --> 01:07:46.648
[melancholy piano music]

01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:02.147
- She's right, you know.

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.394
This is not how family's
supposed to behave.

01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:14.159
[Rhonda sniffles]

01:08:14.262 --> 01:08:15.229
- It's all my fault.

01:08:17.817 --> 01:08:18.818
I lost my brother.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.822
But then I lost
my sister as well.

01:08:25.687 --> 01:08:26.756
- I know you, Joy.

01:08:28.413 --> 01:08:31.796
What's the real reason we
haven't talked all this time?

01:08:33.868 --> 01:08:37.803
- Because you moved on.

01:08:41.013 --> 01:08:41.807
- What?

01:08:43.533 --> 01:08:47.881
- You moved on, and it's like,
he didn't even exist anymore.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:53.198
- Joy,

01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:57.340
losing Joe

01:09:00.343 --> 01:09:04.830
was one of the
worst things I ever

01:09:06.417 --> 01:09:07.832
had to go through.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:14.149
I cried every night.

01:09:16.807 --> 01:09:20.639
I even prayed that
he would come back.

01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:28.336
Then I started to heal.

01:09:32.408 --> 01:09:36.412
[sobs] And I met someone one.

01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:41.832
But it didn't mean I loved
your brother any less.

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:46.803
Look at you.

01:09:48.356 --> 01:09:49.840
You got Nick.

01:09:55.087 --> 01:09:58.815
I had no one to come home to.

01:10:01.887 --> 01:10:05.649
Just cold, empty

01:10:05.753 --> 01:10:07.755
memories of Joe.

01:10:09.584 --> 01:10:11.897
I needed someone, Joy, you know?

01:10:17.385 --> 01:10:20.216
[Rhonda sniffles]

01:10:20.319 --> 01:10:25.255
I just, I just, I just, I just
wanted to be a whole again.

01:10:29.466 --> 01:10:32.607
I thought, I thought Joe
would've wanted that.

01:10:36.162 --> 01:10:39.890
- [sighs] You're
right. He would've.

01:10:45.102 --> 01:10:47.795
I guess I couldn't take
seeing you with someone else.

01:10:50.591 --> 01:10:54.215
But I didn't see
your side of it.

01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:56.838
[somber music]

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:04.260
- I don't wanna
lose my sister, too.

01:11:06.365 --> 01:11:08.850
- Well, we got a
chance to start over

01:11:13.027 --> 01:11:15.857
and make sure that we stay
in each other's lives.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:23.417
I'm so sorry.

01:11:27.144 --> 01:11:28.387
- I love you.

01:11:28.491 --> 01:11:31.045
[gentle music]

01:11:50.858 --> 01:11:53.550
- My dad passed away when I
was younger, so, you know,

01:11:54.862 --> 01:11:57.485
we never really celebrated
much after that.

01:11:57.589 --> 01:11:59.832
So I just go out in town
and look at the lights.

01:12:02.594 --> 01:12:03.836
- I know where he is.

01:12:04.596 --> 01:12:07.806
[gentle piano music]

01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:14.502
- You okay?

01:12:15.676 --> 01:12:17.194
- That was my favorite ornament.

01:12:17.298 --> 01:12:17.954
- I know.

01:12:19.818 --> 01:12:22.683
- It was a picture of
me and, me and Joe.

01:12:22.786 --> 01:12:25.271
One of the only
ones I have of him.

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.307
- She didn't mean it.
- I know.

01:12:26.411 --> 01:12:27.550
- And the picture's still fine.

01:12:27.653 --> 01:12:29.068
- I know, I know. Yeah.

01:12:31.864 --> 01:12:33.521
- It's gonna be
okay, sweetheart.

01:12:35.627 --> 01:12:38.043
- It's been hard for
me this holiday too,

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:41.184
but I'm, you know, trying
to be strong for everybody.

01:12:41.287 --> 01:12:43.773
- And we appreciate
you for that.

01:12:43.876 --> 01:12:45.430
- And sometimes I
just wanna give up

01:12:45.533 --> 01:12:47.017
and forget it's Christmas.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:51.574
- Well, that doesn't sound
like you. You love Christmas.

01:12:53.576 --> 01:12:57.096
- It's been hard to
love lately. [chuckles]

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.064
- I miss my brother, dearly,

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:05.139
but I also miss who we were at
Christmas and our traditions.

01:13:05.242 --> 01:13:06.692
He always had so much fun.

01:13:06.796 --> 01:13:09.661
- Oh, yeah. We did have
good times at the holidays.

01:13:09.764 --> 01:13:14.424

01:13:21.845 --> 01:13:24.296
And this doesn't have
to apply to just dating.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.403
But there's nothing wrong with
telling someone how you feel.

01:13:27.506 --> 01:13:30.475
And sometimes a big
gesture is the way to go.

01:13:33.236 --> 01:13:35.652
- [John] What you doing here?

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:39.484
- I've been trying to call you.

01:13:39.587 --> 01:13:40.968
- [John] I turned off my phone.

01:13:42.072 --> 01:13:42.866
- Oh.

01:13:45.179 --> 01:13:46.491
- So what do you want, Holly?

01:13:50.184 --> 01:13:51.496
- I brought you my phone.

01:13:54.153 --> 01:13:54.878
- Oh, really?

01:13:56.328 --> 01:13:57.156
- Yeah.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.785
First of all, I just
wanna say that I'm sorry.

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:07.615
- That's a first.

01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:10.100
- I deserve that.

01:14:12.655 --> 01:14:14.760
I should've listened
to you about the app.

01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:19.558
- Why? Something happen?

01:14:19.662 --> 01:14:21.595
- [scoffs] Yes,
something happened.

01:14:21.698 --> 01:14:24.805
A bunch of somethings
happened. Everything is a mess.

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:26.703
I think I ruined Christmas.

01:14:26.807 --> 01:14:28.602
John, I need you,
and I will say it

01:14:28.705 --> 01:14:30.742
as many times as you need.

01:14:30.845 --> 01:14:33.054
You have no idea how many
guys showed up at my house.

01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:35.022
- Aw, trust me, yes, I do.

01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:37.645
- My family thinks I'm
a part of some weird

01:14:37.749 --> 01:14:42.167
holiday freak cult.
[John laughs]

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.997
That's not funny.
- It is kind of funny, Holly.

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:51.038
- Okay, you're right. Yeah,
it is kind of funny. [laughs]

01:14:51.141 --> 01:14:54.041
But now we have an
even bigger problem.

01:14:54.144 --> 01:14:56.492
- Bigger than 20 guys showing
up at your front door?

01:14:56.595 --> 01:14:59.080
- Some of the men
have been posting

01:14:59.184 --> 01:15:02.152
about how they were
double-booked on
the new app update,

01:15:02.256 --> 01:15:06.087
and it has gone viral.
- Are you serious?

01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:10.298
- Dianna called and told me
it is all over social media.

01:15:11.576 --> 01:15:14.268
- Whew. That is
kind of bad, Holly.

01:15:14.371 --> 01:15:16.615
[Holly sighs]

01:15:16.719 --> 01:15:18.237
- John, will you fix it?

01:15:19.687 --> 01:15:21.758
- Trust me, Holly. You
know I got your back.

01:15:21.862 --> 01:15:23.657
- So that means you have a plan?

01:15:24.692 --> 01:15:25.900
- It's already done.

01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:29.939
- What's done.
- Fixes.

01:15:31.388 --> 01:15:34.633
I updated the brackets in
the code and tested the app.

01:15:34.737 --> 01:15:36.255
Now it's ready to
go for Christmas.

01:15:37.878 --> 01:15:41.571
So now you can do what you do
best, which is matchmaking.

01:15:42.745 --> 01:15:46.265

best. [squeals]

Come on. Come with me.

Let me show you how my
family celebrates Christmas.

on. Let's get out of the cold.

put it all on the line.

01:16:14.259 --> 01:16:18.056
It can be scary, but some
people really appreciate that.

01:16:18.159 --> 01:16:20.541
And that's what I have
to do with my family.

01:16:20.645 --> 01:16:23.337
I have to be honest and
put it all out there

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.996
and hope they'll forgive me
and celebrate Christmas again.

01:16:27.099 --> 01:16:28.480
- [Joy] What are
you doing back here?

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.206
- Holly. She got
me to come back.

01:16:30.309 --> 01:16:31.932
- Wonderful.

01:16:32.035 --> 01:16:33.761
That's a good man right there.
- Come on in. Yes, he is.

01:16:33.865 --> 01:16:35.660
- Holly's your girl.

01:16:38.283 --> 01:16:42.908
- Look, I know everything is
messed up, and that's my fault.

01:16:43.012 --> 01:16:46.463
I just remember how much we
all enjoy celebrating together.

01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:47.603
Remember?

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:53.643
Dad would be [chuckles]
decorating the tree,

01:16:53.747 --> 01:16:56.404
and Uncle Joe would
be hanging ornaments.

01:16:56.508 --> 01:17:01.617
Mom and Aunt Rhonda would
make those amazing cookies.

01:17:02.756 --> 01:17:04.999
Uncle Joe would be
playing Christmas music.

01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:11.419
I know things can never
be the same as they were

01:17:11.523 --> 01:17:12.697
since Uncle Joe died,

01:17:14.353 --> 01:17:17.391
but that's all the more
reason for us to celebrate.

01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:22.534
- I do miss all of
us being together.

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:25.123
- Me, too. I really
missed you guys.

01:17:27.056 --> 01:17:30.059
- Yeah, I know how
important family is,

01:17:30.162 --> 01:17:32.130
and we shouldn't
take it for granted.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.067
John doesn't really
celebrate Christmas,

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:41.173
so I wanted to show him
how amazing it can be.

01:17:41.277 --> 01:17:41.933
- Is that true?

01:17:42.968 --> 01:17:44.901
- Unfortunately, yes.

01:17:45.005 --> 01:17:46.834
I don't really have much family.

01:17:46.938 --> 01:17:51.045

want us to come together.

- Me, too.

01:17:55.187 --> 01:17:57.880

celebrating Christmas?

were about five years old,

of our lighting tradition,
