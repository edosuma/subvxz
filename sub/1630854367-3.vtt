Just breathe.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.154
You must've had a nightmare.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.956
It wasn't a nightmare.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.960
You really need to
get rid of this dress, Rach.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.528
I'm worried about you.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.730
Get rid of it?

27:46.732 --> 27:48.732
Are you out of your
freaking mind?

27:49.402 --> 27:50.501
Rach.

27:50.503 --> 27:51.835
You don't want me
to look good.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.204
You're just a jealous bitch.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.042
[breathing heavily]

28:01.747 --> 28:03.347
Text me later, or don't.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.415
It's up to you.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.050
Ah.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.065
Lea.

28:24.737 --> 28:25.736
Lea.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.140
[indistinct whispering]

29:04.543 --> 29:06.110
[Mom] Rachel, come on.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.045
Lea's waiting, let's go.

29:08.514 --> 29:09.813
Okay.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.156
[up-tempo music playing]

29:23.529 --> 29:24.962
Are you sure you're okay?

29:24.964 --> 29:26.263
I'm fine.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.332
[music continues playing]

29:32.438 --> 29:34.138
Want to go sit down
for a minute?

29:34.206 --> 29:36.206
[music thumping]

29:39.411 --> 29:40.410
Let's go inside.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.822
[gagging]

29:52.224 --> 29:53.223
Rachel?

29:55.060 --> 29:56.059
Rachel.

29:58.931 --> 29:59.930
[retching]

30:04.003 --> 30:06.003
[students talking loudly]

30:21.053 --> 30:23.053
[water running]

30:40.706 --> 30:42.039
[breathing heavily]

30:45.945 --> 30:48.111
[whimpering]

30:48.447 --> 30:50.314
[gasping]

30:51.350 --> 30:53.016
[screams]

30:53.018 --> 30:54.051
[whimpering]

30:54.620 --> 30:55.752
[gasping]

30:58.724 --> 31:00.724
[intense music playing]

31:16.108 --> 31:18.141
[music intensifies]

31:19.845 --> 31:20.944
[echoing voice] Rachel?

31:21.413 --> 31:23.413
[screaming]

31:43.435 --> 31:44.501
[screaming stops]

31:44.503 --> 31:45.502
[voice squeaks]

31:49.041 --> 31:51.041
[grunting, gasping]

31:57.816 --> 31:58.815
Lea?

32:04.323 --> 32:05.322
Lea.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.258
Lea.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.128
[sobbing]

32:14.433 --> 32:16.400
[breathing heavily]

32:32.952 --> 32:34.818
How exactly did she die?

32:34.820 --> 32:37.421
She was poisoned
by embalming fluid.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.624
Coroner concluded that it
soaked in through her skin.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.326
Soaked through from what?

32:42.328 --> 32:43.727
I'm unsure.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.963
But her death
wouldn't have been pleasant.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.331
She would've
likely experienced

32:47.333 --> 32:50.334
intense hallucinations
as a result of the poisoning.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.135
[clanks]

32:55.708 --> 32:56.707
[clanks]

33:01.046 --> 33:02.813
All right, she's all ready
for the cremation.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.214
Why don't you
go take your break?

33:48.527 --> 33:49.926
[zipper closes]

34:20.959 --> 34:22.426
[humming]

34:24.129 --> 34:26.129
[chair squeaking]

34:29.034 --> 34:31.034
[phone buttons clacking]

34:37.142 --> 34:38.041
Hi.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.810
Yes.

34:39.812 --> 34:42.512
I think I have a piece
you'll be very interested in.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.816
Yes.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.518
One of a kind item.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.701
All right,
that was <i> The White Dress.</i>

35:04.703 --> 35:06.937
A classic, classic
urban legend

35:07.038 --> 35:09.139
that goes back
a number of years.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.808
I am here with
the director now, Ethan Evans.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.410
Hey, thank you so much.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.011
Thank you. Thank you.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.414
We worked together
on <i> The Haunted Museum.</i>

35:17.416 --> 35:21.818
And I absolutely
love your episodes,
love your direction.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.687
-You grew up in the UK?
-Yes.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.822
Here in America,
before the Internet,

35:25.824 --> 35:27.624
you grow up in a town,
in high school,

35:27.626 --> 35:30.961
and someone's like,
"Dude, this girl put on
a white dress for prom,

35:31.062 --> 35:32.529
but it was
a dead person's dress.

35:32.664 --> 35:33.930
And then she became possessed.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.465
The girl tried to kill her.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.200
And anyone
who wore the dress died.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.301
That's a real dress."

35:38.303 --> 35:40.704
Like everybody swore
that it was real.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.106
But they knew one person
who knew someone.

35:43.108 --> 35:45.208
There was like
one or two degrees removed.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.010
Did that happen in the UK?

35:47.012 --> 35:48.545
It was more ghost stories,
you know.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.148
There's a lot of,
like you were saying,
people thinking they're true.

35:51.216 --> 35:53.016
It's kind of like
a game of telephone where,

35:53.018 --> 35:54.550
you know, the best bits stick

35:54.552 --> 35:56.887
and everyone's going around
the playground,
sharing these stories.

35:56.889 --> 35:58.021
It feels like...

35:58.023 --> 36:00.490
Urban legends feel
very American, I think.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.225
Obviously, in choosing
the stories,

36:02.227 --> 36:03.860
there's so many
to choose from,

36:03.929 --> 36:05.929
but one of the things I loved
about <i> The White Dress,</i>

36:05.931 --> 36:10.600
is that it has, kind of,
classic ghost story imagery.

36:10.602 --> 36:13.136
There's something about
the mix of the urban legend

36:13.205 --> 36:16.406
and the classic ghost story
that I absolutely love.

36:16.408 --> 36:19.109
Had you heard the story
of <i> The White Dress</i>  before?

36:19.111 --> 36:21.211
And what excited you
about the story?

36:21.213 --> 36:23.313
And what were you most excited
to shoot in it?

36:23.315 --> 36:24.648
I'd never heard
the story before,

36:24.716 --> 36:26.416
but it's really interesting
when you read into it.

36:26.418 --> 36:30.153
I think it's known as, like,
one of the oldest
American urban legends.

36:30.222 --> 36:33.590
And I think, for me,
when I read it
for the first time,

36:33.592 --> 36:36.059
the word that stood out to me
was, "Mortician."

36:41.633 --> 36:45.035
<i> Just the idea that, it feel</i>
<i> like a classic ghost tale.</i>

36:45.136 --> 36:46.236
The idea that this mortician

36:46.338 --> 36:50.040
would steal dresses from
corpses and sell them on.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.342
But at the same time,
it feels like something
that could actually happen.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.511
Which is, you know,
are the best urban legends.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.213
Yeah, they live
in that space of:

36:56.215 --> 36:59.115
it sounds so crazy,
but is also still possible.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.229
[zipper closes]

37:14.399 --> 37:17.334
[Ethan] <i> I recently went</i>
<i> to a true crime museum</i>
<i> and I I saw this,</i>

37:17.435 --> 37:20.036
it was this beautiful dress
and I went up
and read the description.

37:20.105 --> 37:23.840
And it told the story
about how this was
a British serial killer,

37:23.942 --> 37:26.443
wore this dress and murdered,
like, 100 children.

37:26.511 --> 37:28.745
And suddenly, I got, you know,
shivers going through my body.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.113
It was like,
it was so interesting,

37:30.115 --> 37:34.117
the psychology of how
such a beautiful
but mundane object

37:34.119 --> 37:36.853
can, you know, hold so much
power and energy.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.989
And that's exactly
the first thing I thought of

37:38.991 --> 37:40.223
when I read this urban legend.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.859
It's, "We can have so much fun
playing with this

37:42.927 --> 37:45.128
<i> and crafting these</i>
<i> ghostly scares</i>

37:45.130 --> 37:46.730
<i> and really getting</i>
<i> under people's skin."</i>

37:52.004 --> 37:55.138
Well, there is something
about your clothing
that is so your identity.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.207
Our clothing is how
we express ourselves

37:57.209 --> 38:01.211
and telegraph to others
who we are
and what our intention is,

38:01.213 --> 38:03.213
or hide it or disguise it.

38:03.215 --> 38:06.516
And there is something,
I think, people love
buying vintage clothes,

38:06.518 --> 38:09.619
but every time you put on
something that's
100 years old,

38:09.621 --> 38:12.756
you think, "Who else wore this
and what was their life like?

38:12.824 --> 38:13.823
And how did they die?"

38:13.825 --> 38:15.224
You go into a vintage store,

38:15.226 --> 38:17.627
and you have no idea
the history of
what you're picking up.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.262
And like you say,
for all we know,

38:19.364 --> 38:21.698
maybe someone, you know,
has murdered someone
in this, you know?

38:21.700 --> 38:22.932
That's a terrifying thought.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.401
And, I think,
that's definitely

38:24.403 --> 38:26.603
something we wanted
to get across
through this episode,

38:26.605 --> 38:29.306
<i> is that history</i>
<i> and putting a lot of focus</i>
<i> on the dress itself.</i>

38:32.844 --> 38:35.845
What was the most
challenging scene for you
to shoot in this episode?

38:35.914 --> 38:37.914
I think perhaps the climax,

38:37.916 --> 38:39.616
which is this...

38:39.618 --> 38:41.918
It's quite a big scene
set in a bathroom stall.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.854
There's quite a lot of action,
and there's stunts as well,

38:44.923 --> 38:47.290
and trying to suddenly flip.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.724
At that moment,

38:48.794 --> 38:51.361
she goes from being
quite quiet, to herself
within the scene,

38:51.430 --> 38:53.963
and then, suddenly, exploding
and attacking someone,

38:53.965 --> 38:55.298
<i> strangling and screaming.</i>

38:55.300 --> 38:57.334
[screaming]

39:03.241 --> 39:05.208
[Ethan] <i> And I think there's</i>
<i> so much that went into that</i>

39:05.210 --> 39:07.410
<i> and I think that was</i>
<i> probably challenging</i>

39:07.412 --> 39:09.612
<i> just based on getting</i>
<i> the performance there,</i>

39:09.614 --> 39:13.616
and focus really heavily
on safe stunts, you know.

39:13.618 --> 39:15.151
I think that was a lot for...

39:15.253 --> 39:17.487
This was Leslie's first film
as well that she'd done,

39:17.489 --> 39:20.357
so she was so committed
and gave it her all.

39:20.458 --> 39:21.958
And thanks to the team.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.760
We had such an amazing team.

39:23.829 --> 39:27.230
Such a daunting scene
felt like such a joy to film.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.565
How much do you shot list?

39:28.633 --> 39:29.933
How much do you storyboard?

39:29.935 --> 39:32.102
How much do you just show up
and figure it out?

39:32.104 --> 39:33.636
For me, I've got OCD.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.139
In the real sense,
not the, kind of,
cleaning sense.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.708
And so that means
that feeds into my directing,

39:38.710 --> 39:40.610
and so I, just my mind works.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.912
I just have to be so specific
about everything.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.247
Which can be really
draining at times

39:44.349 --> 39:45.949
because I do multiple drafts
for shot list,

39:45.951 --> 39:47.650
you know,
storyboard everything.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.520
I'm a big believer of that
your film or your episode

39:50.522 --> 39:52.055
is only as good
as you're planning.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.122
Do you draw the storyboards?

39:53.124 --> 39:54.491
Do you have a storyboard
artist you work with?

39:54.493 --> 39:55.725
I just do them myself.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.627
And my dad's an artist,

39:57.629 --> 40:00.430
and you'd never guess that
looking at my storyboards,
because they're all--

40:00.432 --> 40:02.932
Yeah, I've, like, my mom's
an artist and it's like...

40:02.934 --> 40:04.801
-Yeah.
-It's like caveman paintings.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.537
As long as you can get
the idea across to like the DP

40:07.606 --> 40:09.739
and show, "This is what
I'm, kind of, looking for.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.041
Maybe there's a push in here,
a two shot..."

40:12.043 --> 40:14.344
Or, you know, as long
as you can get that
information across, I think.

40:14.413 --> 40:17.247
It really helps as well,
on the day when you're
pushed for time,

40:17.348 --> 40:19.149
you're just scanning through
the shot list and you can see,

40:19.217 --> 40:21.618
you know, still of what
you're trying to achieve

40:21.620 --> 40:22.652
just at a glance.

40:22.721 --> 40:25.155
Is there a formula you use
for different,

40:25.223 --> 40:26.723
-for building
tension and scare?
-Yeah.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.559
It's more about showing
the environment
a character is in

40:29.628 --> 40:31.094
as opposed to their reaction,

40:31.096 --> 40:34.330
because that way,
you place the audience
as if they're really there.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.999
You know, it's almost
becomes a documentary,

40:36.001 --> 40:38.401
you're experiencing it
as the character is.

40:38.403 --> 40:41.938
<i> And I think, at the same tim</i>
<i> reactions are so important.</i>

40:41.940 --> 40:43.373
<i> So it's about</i>
<i> spending the time,</i>

40:43.375 --> 40:45.508
<i> making sure you</i>
<i> get the actor there as well</i>

40:45.510 --> 40:47.977
<i> so it's such</i>
<i> a technical thing,</i>

40:48.046 --> 40:49.612
<i> and it's something</i>
<i> I'm still learning about.</i>

40:51.116 --> 40:53.216
<i> Breaking down</i>
<i> what makes a good scare?</i>

40:59.391 --> 41:00.423
[screaming]

41:03.295 --> 41:05.428
I've got like
a 200-page document

41:05.430 --> 41:08.565
where I've just broken down
various horror films.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.601
And, you know,
"What's the key scares?
And what happens?

41:11.603 --> 41:12.902
What techniques do they use?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.237
What works, what doesn't?"

41:14.339 --> 41:16.072
And then, like, a little
conclusion about,

41:16.074 --> 41:18.041
basically, what my
thoughts were.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.409
Was that successful,
was it not?

41:20.679 --> 41:21.811
[whimpering]

41:21.813 --> 41:23.413
[gasping]

41:24.416 --> 41:25.415
[screaming]

41:27.118 --> 41:28.518
I'm such a fan of your work.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.653
I'm really excited to see
where your career goes.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.021
Thank you so much.
It means the world.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.656
Especially, coming from you
because, you know,

41:33.725 --> 41:35.325
I've grown up
watching all your films.

41:35.327 --> 41:36.693
Thank you,
I feel really old now.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.428
-[laughs]
-No, it's okay.

41:38.430 --> 41:39.863
No, honestly,
I think I'm still

41:39.964 --> 41:41.431
recovering from <i> Hostel,</i>
to be honest.

41:41.433 --> 41:42.999
-Great.
-Yeah, it was definitely one

41:43.001 --> 41:44.801
where I sat in the shower
afterwards and thought,

41:44.803 --> 41:47.303
you know, "What is life?
This is amazing."

41:47.305 --> 41:48.972
-[laughs]
-Well, that's well, you know,

41:48.974 --> 41:50.707
hopefully, your films
are going to do that

41:50.709 --> 41:51.941
to someone else out there.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.611
Hopefully, some young viewer
is completely traumatized

41:54.613 --> 41:56.613
in the shower now going,
"Oh God."

41:56.615 --> 41:57.847
-I know.
-"What am I going to do?"

41:57.949 --> 41:59.115
I hope so. I hope so.
