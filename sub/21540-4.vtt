- Let's take a step back

02:02.956 --> 02:05.792
I agree with the idea that we
shouldn't list the penthouse.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.360
I don't think
it should be listed,

us to show the penthouse

as a carrot.

Please, let me finish.

What I saw there was 100 people
who loved the project.

02:16.836 --> 02:18.905
The results were there
that in the end--

02:18.938 --> 02:21.141
- The results or offers?

02:21.174 --> 02:22.842
I think to sell something--
- Look.

- And not stick
to our original plan, because--

02:25.512 --> 02:28.915
- Maybe you don't understand
the Brooklyn market.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.550
The problem is is that
we have development.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.085
We're trying to sell
two apartments

02:32.118 --> 02:33.853

You came to me.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.193
You hired me because
you wanted something fresh,

02:40.226 --> 02:41.494

02:41.528 --> 02:44.864
But now I feel
like it's not being executed,

facing the bridge,

07:05.625 --> 07:08.261

the blended average down.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.135
[whistles]

08:22.168 --> 08:23.603
- Hi, Ryan?
- Yeah, Ryan.

08:23.636 --> 08:24.637
- Ward.
- Nice to see you.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.206
- How are you?
- Thanks for having me.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.207
- This is my daughter, Caroline.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.942
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.677
- Aren't you pretty?
Ryan.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.678
Good grip.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.580
Ward is a real estate developer,

08:33.613 --> 08:35.615
<i>and he's had this place</i>
<i>on the market</i>

08:35.648 --> 08:37.751
for over three years.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.252
- Ready?
- Yeah.

08:39.285 --> 08:42.889
- All right.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.824
Ooh.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.626
- This is the original bedrock
of Manhattan.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.162
We excavated down
an additional five feet.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.797
- This is so cool.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.098
I love this.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.401
This is like a "Mission:
Impossible" wine cellar.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.402
This is your favorite part
of the house, right?

08:55.435 --> 08:56.403
Wine cellar?

08:56.436 --> 09:01.274
- Uh-huh.
- I knew it.

09:01.307 --> 09:02.275
Oh, cool.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.777
It's a very beautiful kitchen.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.247
<i>Ward did an amazing job</i>
<i>with the renovations here.</i>

09:07.280 --> 09:09.683
<i>This used to be a 12-unit</i>
<i>multi-family rental building.</i>

09:09.716 --> 09:11.017
How many floors it is again?

09:11.017 --> 09:12.285
- Seven.
- We got seven floors.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.688
- And now it is
an immaculately designed

09:14.721 --> 09:17.023
single-family town home.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.359
All right, so now we are
on the master floor.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.095
This is the master closet.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.664
- Well, it's one
of three master closets.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.866
- Oh.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.337
Oh, my Jeebus.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.438
<i>He doesn't have</i>
<i>one master bath.</i>

09:31.471 --> 09:33.340
<i>He has two master baths.</i>

09:33.373 --> 09:34.741
This may be one
of the nicest master baths

09:34.774 --> 09:36.176
I've ever seen.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.311
<i>He's got crown moldings</i>
<i>on top of crown moldings</i>

09:38.345 --> 09:39.879
<i>on top of crown moldings.</i>

09:39.913 --> 09:42.515
- So up here, we have
two bedrooms in the back,

09:42.549 --> 09:44.684
another living area,

09:44.718 --> 09:46.219
another formal dining room.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.821
-<i>You've got too many fireplaces</i>
<i>to the point</i>

09:47.854 --> 09:49.923
<i>where I can't even remember</i>
<i>how many fireplaces there are.</i>

09:49.956 --> 09:51.524
And now we just have
one more floor to go?

09:51.558 --> 09:53.093
- We actually have
two more floors to go.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.661
- Two more floor?
- Two more floors.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.329
Then we can take
the elevator down.

09:56.363 --> 10:00.066
- The house is so big.
It keeps going.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.601
Oh, we made it.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.503
Have you ever seen an episode
of "Sex in the City"?

10:03.536 --> 10:04.871
The one episode I've ever seen,

10:04.904 --> 10:06.506
<i>where that blonde person</i>
<i>Samantha,</i>

10:06.539 --> 10:07.507
<i>she meets that guy,</i>

10:07.540 --> 10:09.175
and his dick is too big,

10:09.209 --> 10:10.443
and she's just like,
"Oh, let's just be friends"?

10:10.477 --> 10:14.347
That guy is this house.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.815
[chuckles]

10:15.849 --> 10:19.552
Yeah.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.854
And we're back.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.356
So you bought the house
four years ago for how much?

10:23.390 --> 10:24.457
- 5.2 million.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.560
Total renovation,
you know, about $6 million.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.730
- So you listed it for 18
3 1/2 years ago.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.365
- Basically.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.400
- What's wrong with the house?

10:33.433 --> 10:34.768
- Product like this,

10:34.801 --> 10:37.404
there haven't been a lot
of sales on the Upper West Side.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.406
Yeah, we just don't think
we've found the right buyer yet.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.974
- Right.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.142
<i>They've been priced at 18</i>
<i>for 3 1/2 years,</i>

10:42.175 --> 10:43.877
but they haven't had
a single offer.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.979
Like, zero offers.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.313
- It needs the right buyer.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.984
- $2200 a square foot
isn't a crazy number.

10:51.017 --> 10:55.689
The problem is, is that the
house has so many square feet.

10:55.722 --> 11:00.226
I think 16
is the right number,

11:00.260 --> 11:02.062
but I'd list it at 18.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.663
Screw it, let's do it.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.598
- I mean, we really thought
that if we can have

11:05.632 --> 11:07.367
enough seekers coming along,

11:07.400 --> 11:12.072
we thought 20 million would
really be the going price.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.275
- What?

11:15.308 --> 11:16.309
-<i>Coming up.</i>

11:16.343 --> 11:17.844
- Have you spoken to Ryan?

11:17.877 --> 11:19.512
- Ryan?

11:28.254 --> 11:28.621
<i>[intense music]</i>

11:30.557 --> 11:32.425
- We really thought
that if we can, you know,

11:32.459 --> 11:33.827
have enough seekers
coming along,

11:33.860 --> 11:39.466
then we thought 20 million
would really be the going price.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.167
- Ah, interesting.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.436
- And I mean,
this house is immaculate.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.838
- Now, don't get me wrong.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.407
I've been successful before
by raising the price.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.377
It's just, you know,
listings become stale.

11:50.410 --> 11:54.814
It's been on the market
for so long...

11:54.848 --> 11:56.249
- You're the number one broker
in New York.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.151
You know you can sell
this house.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.788
- Number one broker in New York
based on closed sales.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.590
- $20 million listing.

12:03.623 --> 12:07.427
I would hope you'd be
excited about that.

12:07.460 --> 12:12.866
- What do you think
I should do?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.534
- Sell it.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.902
- Oh, great.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.904
Uh...

12:28.214 --> 12:31.351
No.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.952
- No?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.654
Really?

12:34.688 --> 12:36.656
- I think I have to go
with my gut on this one.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.359
I can't do it at 20.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.595
- Well, this is obviously,
you know, disappointing.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.397
We'll send you a note
when it closes.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.533
- Uh, right.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.836
I have never ever
walked away

12:49.869 --> 12:52.572
from a $20 million listing,

12:52.605 --> 12:55.575
<i>but I like it.</i>

12:55.608 --> 12:59.646
I feel lighter.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.214
<i>But there's always that maybe,</i>

13:01.247 --> 13:03.049
that someone is gonna
walk through the door.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.485
<i>They're gonna love it,</i>
<i>and they're gonna buy it</i>

13:05.518 --> 13:11.358
and that is $600,000
that you just lost.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.960
I think I may have just done
the dumbest thing

13:14.060 --> 13:16.062
I've ever done
in my career.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.503
- Thank you.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.205
It was the right decision.
It was the right decision.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.241
Oh, man.

- What's up?

13:50.697 --> 13:51.664
How are you?

13:51.698 --> 13:52.866
- How you doing?
- Good to see you.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.701
- Good to see you, too.

on a professional environment,

13:57.337 --> 13:59.172
it was very bad.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.373
- I love the car.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.777
- Did you buy that?
How expensive was that?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.612

14:09.649 --> 14:10.684
How's life?
No, wait.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.718
Let's start
with the important.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.053
How's love?

14:13.086 --> 14:15.755
- Eh, you know,

14:15.789 --> 14:17.390
I'm getting married.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.792
- Shocked.
- I'm joking.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.528
- Oh, my God.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.063
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what it is about Luis.</i>

about him without smiling.

14:25.799 --> 14:30.303
<i>He has something</i>
<i>so innocent about him,</i>

14:30.337 --> 14:31.471
uplifting.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.706
- I mean,
look at this.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.541
[giggles]

14:34.574 --> 14:37.143
- So talking to him is like
talking to myself ten years ago.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.212
"Papi, I'm winning
this big listing."

14:39.245 --> 14:41.815
<i>I love that,</i>
<i>because I used to be like this.</i>

14:41.848 --> 14:43.650
So, business.
Talk to me.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.818
- I'm doing work in Brooklyn,

14:44.851 --> 14:45.919
and so are you, I see.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.187
- Yeah, yeah,
it's 60 units.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.288
Soon enough it's
gonna be 30,

14:48.321 --> 14:49.489
'cause it's gonna go
like that.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.523
What do you have?

14:50.557 --> 14:51.958
- I have--it's
a smaller development.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.594
It's a three-unit development
from this amazing developer.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.196
She is, uh, from London.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.098
<i>Extremely amazing taste.</i>

14:58.098 --> 15:00.200
<i>They went all-out</i>
<i>with the finishes.</i>

15:00.233 --> 15:01.568
-<i>What are the price points?</i>

15:01.601 --> 15:03.336
- We are at $1,400
per square foot.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.337
- Oh.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.638
- Which is a little bit high,

15:05.672 --> 15:08.041
but I think that the person
that understands the kind

15:08.041 --> 15:10.210
of product that she brought in
is going to pay for it.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.046
- Are you--are you targeting
Manhattanites?

15:13.046 --> 15:14.581
- Yes.
- Or are you thinking, like--

15:14.614 --> 15:15.682
- So that's smart.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.150
Hire the right person
from there.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.351
Okay, so this is perfect.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.486
I'm going to
send clients to you.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.587
You're going to do
the same to me.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.355
- I know.
- Let's do some deals.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.590
- Yeah, no, I love it.
- Let's do it.

15:23.623 --> 15:24.591
I'm ready.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.592
- Deal.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.826
So what's happening?
What else?

15:26.860 --> 15:28.561
Have you spoken to Ryan?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.864
- Ryan?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.298
No.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.299
- You know,
we worked together--

15:33.333 --> 15:34.467
- Yeah, tell me.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.869
How did it go?

15:35.902 --> 15:37.737
- You have to go
with a different broker.

15:37.771 --> 15:38.905
- I will think twice

15:38.938 --> 15:40.407
about next time you call me
to co-list.

<i>* *</i>

15:45.078 --> 15:47.547

[laughter]

15:50.150 --> 15:51.117
- Okay, then.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.119
- Yeah.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.222
There was--there was a lack
of integrity kind of thing.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.658
It's okay.
I sort of got over that.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.026
But I was very pissed, man.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.227
I was very pissed.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.629
- It's not because
he's a bad person.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.197
I think he's actually
a good person,

16:04.230 --> 16:07.667
but there's something
very insecure about him.

16:07.701 --> 16:08.835
That's what I think.

16:08.868 --> 16:13.039
You know, I see him from afar
on social media,

16:13.039 --> 16:15.408
which got very nauseating to me
and very tiring.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.043
I had to un-follow him,

16:17.043 --> 16:21.815
and this inflating
how big he is in his numbers,

16:21.848 --> 16:24.250
and the likes?

16:24.284 --> 16:28.722
Luis, he's swiping his credit
cards to buy followers.

16:28.755 --> 16:32.625
You and I texted
about this a week ago.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.727
- Yeah.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.261
Today we live
in a social media world.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.364
That's the way we communicate
with our clients,

16:37.397 --> 16:38.365
<i>with the world.</i>

16:38.398 --> 16:39.366
But hold on.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.734
Wait for it.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.204
So here's the screen shots
of Ryan Serhant's

16:44.237 --> 16:48.608
4,100 likes in 18 minutes,

16:48.641 --> 16:52.512
and then I looked
at some of the followers--

16:52.545 --> 16:54.347
some of the people
that liked him,

16:54.381 --> 16:56.916
and empty accounts.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.651
Two followers,
no posts yet.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.588
Another one,
0 followers.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.024
Another one, 0.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.893
You're buying likes, Ryan.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.495
You're buying likes.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.330
- He's doing amazingly well,
so why pretend?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.631
Why pretend to be anyone?

17:11.664 --> 17:13.266
- I don't know.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.201
- He's so weird.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.570
[laughter]

for a second?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.552
<i>Since I left Ward</i>
<i>on 87th Street,</i>

17:32.585 --> 17:35.155

it feels weird.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.524
<i>I've always taken</i>
<i>the most risks,</i>

17:37.557 --> 17:39.893

the most rewards,

17:39.926 --> 17:42.395
<i>but I know I have</i>
<i>good instincts</i>

17:42.429 --> 17:44.764
and sometimes
you have to know what's right.

17:44.798 --> 17:45.765
- What's wrong?

17:45.799 --> 17:47.500
- Can you tell me a joke?

17:47.534 --> 17:50.537
To, like,
make me feel better?

17:50.570 --> 17:53.373
- A dirty joke?
Funny joke?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.574
- Are you, like,
a joke machine?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.709
Do you have
a lot of joke options?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.610
- No.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.611
Knock knock.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.513
- Who's there?
- Needle.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.614
- Needle who?

18:01.648 --> 18:04.184
- Need a little money
for the movies?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.185
- That's stupid.
Please leave.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.686
I don't feel
any better.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.787
I think I actually feel
worse now.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.589
[phone rings]

18:09.622 --> 18:11.257
- Hey, Ryan.
- Yes?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.293
- Uh, Ward's on the phone
for you.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.429
- Ward?

18:16.463 --> 18:17.630
Hey, Ward.
How are you?

18:19.132 --> 18:20.266
- Awesome.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.506
- Right.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.753
<i>* *</i>

18:39.786 --> 18:40.787
- Yes!

18:44.524 --> 18:48.261
- I think I would be ready
to take on the listing.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.165
He loves me.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.067
<i>I just wish he loved me</i>
<i>a little less.</i>

18:54.067 --> 18:55.935
Like $3, 4 million less.

18:55.969 --> 18:59.572
But...I'm glad he chose me.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.574
Okay.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.110
Now how am I going
to sell this house?

19:04.144 --> 19:05.512
-<i>Coming up.</i>

19:05.545 --> 19:09.416
- I think that I should hold
back a certain number of units.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.051
- What? What?

19:18.358 --> 19:18.725

I don't understand.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.633
This is, like,
49 glasses.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.701
- I was gonna grab some
right now.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.803
- We need this
plus ten times more.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.237
<i>Even though I'm</i>
<i>the top broker in New York</i>

19:31.271 --> 19:34.341

<i>there's still certain events</i>
<i>where even I get nervous.</i>

19:37.844 --> 19:38.812
I'm very stressed.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.380
<i>My developer/seller Mona,</i>

19:40.413 --> 19:44.484

show sheets.

19:46.820 --> 19:48.254
<i>The last thing I need</i>
<i>is to juggle her</i>

19:48.288 --> 19:50.290
<i>while I'm juggling</i>
<i>hundreds of other brokers.</i>

19:50.323 --> 19:51.624
Ah!

19:51.658 --> 19:54.327
Jordan, there's a line of people
around the block.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.429
It's like a club.
It's like a nightclub.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.931
<i>I invited everyone.</i>

19:57.964 --> 19:59.132
<i>People from Manhattan</i>
<i>to Brooklyn,</i>

19:59.165 --> 20:00.133
<i>and look at this.</i>

20:00.166 --> 20:01.968
500-something-plus people.

20:02.002 --> 20:03.503
Jordan.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.504
Where are the books to hand out?
Can you--

20:04.537 --> 20:05.672
Here.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.173
When I started
in the real estate industry,

20:07.207 --> 20:08.308
this was 13 years ago,

20:08.341 --> 20:09.642
<i>there wasn't this one book</i>

20:09.676 --> 20:11.978
<i>where at least I could find</i>
<i>inspiration in.</i>

20:12.012 --> 20:14.581
So I wrote it.
This was very personal.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.316
<i>It was probably the most</i>
<i>personal thing I've ever done.</i>

20:16.349 --> 20:18.318
To write this book took years.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.452
I mean, you know me.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.521
You know how much this book
means to me.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.323
It'd be nice to share it
with my fellow brokers.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.924
Come here, everybody.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.160
- Thank you.
- Welcome to Williamsburg.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.396
- Thank you.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.398
- I guess--oh, you've read it.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.768
- Yeah, oh, you did, you
bought it. Okay, that's good.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.869
<i>* *</i>

20:38.071 --> 20:39.239
- Well, I like the noise.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.373
Makes me feel
like I'm in New York.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.108
You know, some people
like chirping birds.

20:42.142 --> 20:44.344
I like noisy bridges.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.512
I need to get everybody inside,

20:45.545 --> 20:47.147
even the negative people,

20:47.180 --> 20:48.715
'cause once they're inside
they won't notice the bridge.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.751
I mean, they're just going to be
in there with their competition.

20:51.785 --> 20:53.653
Welcome to Williamsburg.

20:53.687 --> 20:56.723
[cheering]

20:56.756 --> 21:00.960
Okay, so 5F,
2.5 million.

21:01.061 --> 21:02.462
I think you could sell it
to your buyer.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.498
I sold a parking spot
for $1 million in Manhattan.

21:05.532 --> 21:06.766
This is a conversion
which is better,

21:06.800 --> 21:08.368
'cause a conversion,
you get the high ceilings,

21:08.401 --> 21:09.402
and everything is new.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.537
Hey, look at the stone darts.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.538
Touch it.
Feel it.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.940
Ooh, yes, yes.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.308
It's kind of like
when I touch Derek naked.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.443
It's like, ooh!

21:16.476 --> 21:17.811
[laughter]

21:17.844 --> 21:20.280
Let's go to the penthouse.

21:20.313 --> 21:23.083
45-foot living room.

21:23.083 --> 21:26.086
Double corner,
look at this view.

21:28.088 --> 21:29.856
- It's a bridge.
The bridge means water.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.157
The water means views.

21:31.191 --> 21:32.826
Look, the World Trade Center.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.427
The skyline.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.595
<i>Although a couple of people</i>

21:35.628 --> 21:36.996
<i>have been</i>
<i>pointing out the bridge,</i>

21:37.097 --> 21:38.798
so far it hasn't been
a huge issue.

21:38.832 --> 21:40.400
- We got a buyer
from California.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.735
They need to see this.

21:41.768 --> 21:42.936
- I mean,
he's got to come now,

21:42.969 --> 21:44.204
because this is gonna go,
I'm telling you.

21:44.237 --> 21:46.506
- You can't hold it
for 24 hours?

21:46.539 --> 21:47.907
- I can't hold anything.

21:47.941 --> 21:50.377
A successful launch event
doesn't happen by itself.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.245
<i>Like, pushing</i>
<i>all those people in,</i>

21:52.278 --> 21:53.880
<i>you create</i>
<i>almost like a paranoia,</i>

21:53.913 --> 21:56.483
that people feel,
"I am going to miss out."

21:56.516 --> 21:58.885
Who's going to get
the commission first?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.720
- I am.
- We'll see.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.122
- I have a buyer that actually
I think

22:02.155 --> 22:03.223
would be really interested
in this.

22:03.256 --> 22:05.058
- Yeah, I have a buyer
looking for a 2-bed.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.226
- I have a client
on the phone right now.

22:06.259 --> 22:07.560
- Yes, hello?

22:07.594 --> 22:08.928
Do you feel the floor moving?

22:08.962 --> 22:11.264
'cause this might be sold
right underneath you.

22:11.297 --> 22:16.670
<i>* *</i>

22:16.703 --> 22:19.773
Oh.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.107
So, my love.

22:21.141 --> 22:22.942
You were questioning my ability,
you know,

22:22.976 --> 22:25.645
being "New York,
Manhattan broker."

22:25.679 --> 22:29.783
Four, five, six,
eight, nine units

22:29.816 --> 22:32.819
are gonna be sold by the end
of this night out of the 60.

22:32.852 --> 22:36.489
That's just now,
one hour into the party.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.225
- Um, I'm a little bit
anxious about it.

22:39.259 --> 22:40.660
- Anxious?
What's anxious?

22:40.694 --> 22:44.597
- I'm walking around and I'm
hearing so much interest

22:44.631 --> 22:46.099
in all of the units

22:46.132 --> 22:49.469
that I think
that I should hold back

22:49.502 --> 22:51.771
a certain number
of units.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.640
- W--what?
What?

22:53.673 --> 22:56.643
- Maybe I'm gonna take, like,
10 to 12 units for myself.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.546
- No, no, no.
I don't understand.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.814
- I'm thrilled
with the turnout.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.416
This market is going
to be explosive.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.352
- Well, of course, because I
threw a party with 500 people--

23:05.385 --> 23:07.053
- You did an amazing job.

23:07.087 --> 23:08.822
- Well,
apparently too amazing.

23:08.855 --> 23:12.459
She is actually
pulling units from me

23:12.492 --> 23:15.161
<i>so she can sell them later</i>
<i>at a higher price?</i>

23:15.195 --> 23:17.597
This is exactly why I didn't
want her at the party.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.698
Which are you gonna take off?

23:18.732 --> 23:19.933
I'm getting offers.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.101
- We'll go through them.

23:21.134 --> 23:22.302
- I'm just getting started.

23:22.335 --> 23:24.404
To send out the whole thing,
I can't just, like--

23:24.437 --> 23:26.740
it's like chopping off
someone's foot or leg.

23:26.773 --> 23:27.807
You can't cripple me
like this.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.376
- I have so much
heart and soul in it,

23:29.409 --> 23:32.278
and I really think we should
just hold back ten or 12 units.

23:32.312 --> 23:34.547
You can have all the rest.
- No, no, no.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.815
Mona, I can't do right now.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.117
I've got to do my job.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.886
I'm gonna sell this for you
like I was hired to do.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.087
I'm just not gonna
listen to her.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.822
It's like,
she's gonna have a drink

23:42.856 --> 23:44.491
and she's gonna forget
about this.

23:44.524 --> 23:45.792
<i>And I'm gonna forget about it.</i>

23:45.825 --> 23:47.827
I'm gonna pretend
I never heard it, honestly.

Good?

- Good, good.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.176
- Nice.

24:36.209 --> 24:38.178
Also, if we get

24:38.211 --> 24:39.979
they have to be nice to me,

24:40.080 --> 24:42.515
uh, because I'm their boss.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.817
So this is the house
I've been talking about,

24:43.850 --> 24:45.919
the greatest town house
in the history of man.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.687
We just put it on for 18.

24:47.721 --> 24:50.757
It is 8,500 square feet,
seven floors.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.425
Place was basically built
for a family.

- Is there a pool?

24:54.461 --> 24:55.428
- Yeah.

Bel Air, we have pools.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.932
- No, there's no pool here.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.534
- But you have a tennis court?

25:01.568 --> 25:03.770
- Obviously real estate differs
from city to city.

25:03.803 --> 25:07.841
This is Hamptons-style living
in New York City.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.812
- Will your client
give some allowance

"Oh, it doesn't have views
of the Empire State Building?"

25:20.053 --> 25:22.122
That's stupid.

Remember, too, like, we're
in a New York state of mind,

25:24.891 --> 25:25.859

- Yeah.
- Like, it is no joke.

25:37.070 --> 25:38.304
- Incredible.

25:38.338 --> 25:41.841
- And you have one, two,
and three walk-in closets.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.576
- We need walk-in closets
for sure.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.078
- Yes.
- It's huge in LA.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.880

likes to work out.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.082
- Nice. Yeah.
Absolutely.

our whole mailing list in LA.

- And all the people that you
have that live in huge houses,

26:10.704 --> 26:12.339
we should shove this
in front of their face.

26:12.372 --> 26:15.809

I will find them.

26:21.381 --> 26:22.849
- Jordan, there he is.
- Hey.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.951

a little rough patch.

do you want to hear the news?

26:28.455 --> 26:29.456

26:33.727 --> 26:34.894
We got an offer,

I came to the open house

26:37.664 --> 26:40.066

absolutely loved it.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.435
They are all-cash

- Yes.

the same thing.

<i>But we can tell them that</i>
<i>there's another buyer bidding</i>

28:10.857 --> 28:12.425
<i>against the same property.</i>

28:12.459 --> 28:13.660
It creates a little fear.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.729
It creates concern
that they may actually lose it.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.099
- Do your magic.
All right, bye bye.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.735

She's not going to be able

Of course
I was serious.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.306
- But no, Mona, don't say that
you're holding because I know,

33:26.339 --> 33:27.307
you're not leaving this lunch.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.441
You're not gonna hold any units.

33:46.626 --> 33:49.195
and now three of those 12
are actually units

33:49.229 --> 33:50.897
that I'm about to close.

33:50.930 --> 33:52.699
I sold 15.
That means 45.

33:52.732 --> 33:54.501
Take whatever you want
out of the 45 units.

33:54.534 --> 33:55.635
Fine.
It's your building.

33:55.669 --> 33:57.103
I can't force you,

33:57.103 --> 33:58.505
but you can't take away units
that I already sold.

33:58.538 --> 33:59.506
Those deal sheets are done.

33:59.539 --> 34:01.041
- They're not executed yet.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.242
The party was just
a couple of days ago.

34:02.275 --> 34:03.243
- Executed?

34:03.276 --> 34:04.477
Those are offers
with deal sheets.

34:04.511 --> 34:05.512
I have attorney information.

34:05.545 --> 34:07.514
- Three of them,
I'm keeping.

34:07.547 --> 34:08.515
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:08.548 --> 34:11.818
This cannot be happening.

34:11.851 --> 34:12.952
-<i>Coming up.</i>

34:13.053 --> 34:14.587
- We hired the best.

34:14.621 --> 34:16.222
Go get us the best price.

34:16.256 --> 34:17.857

but you're not hearing me.

34:29.836 --> 34:31.137
- You don't understand.
Those contracts are drafted.

34:31.171 --> 34:32.706
Those are ready
to push "send."

34:32.739 --> 34:34.674
- There's lots of other units
that you could sell.

34:34.708 --> 34:37.410
Of the 15, three of them
I'm keeping.

34:37.444 --> 34:42.315
- Whatever you do,
you cannot take off 7F, 676A.

34:42.349 --> 34:45.952
Those are all one investor
that also buying 2J.

34:45.985 --> 34:48.688
- No, you can have the 2J,
but the other three---

34:48.722 --> 34:50.457
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:50.490 --> 34:51.458
Why these 12?

34:51.491 --> 34:53.093
Like, where is this
coming from?

34:53.093 --> 34:55.228
- Those would make
the best rental units.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.298
I can rent these units now

34:58.331 --> 34:59.899
and wait for the market
to go up,

34:59.933 --> 35:01.468
because I think
in five years from now

35:01.501 --> 35:04.571
that those units will be
worth a lot more money.

35:04.604 --> 35:06.106
Let them switch.

35:06.139 --> 35:07.841
- This investor, he's just
not going to switch.

35:07.874 --> 35:11.044
I mean, he wants them for
the same reason she wants them.

35:11.044 --> 35:12.045
What am I gonna do now?

35:12.045 --> 35:13.079
I'm gonna call Lisa, say,

35:13.113 --> 35:15.382
"Unfortunately,
we don't have a deal."

35:15.415 --> 35:17.917
- I explicitly told you
during the party

35:17.951 --> 35:20.053
that I was going to hold
onto a certain number of units.

35:20.086 --> 35:23.189
I'm really not understanding
why you went

35:23.223 --> 35:25.058
and took the deal sheet.

35:25.058 --> 35:26.159
- I don't take a deal sheet.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.694
They e-mailed me
the information--

35:27.727 --> 35:28.828
- Okay, fine, so now we're
having a conversation about it.

35:28.862 --> 35:30.797
- I don't accept anything
on your behalf.

35:30.830 --> 35:35.201
- And now I'm telling you.
I'm not accepting it.

35:35.235 --> 35:36.936
- So that's what it is.

35:36.970 --> 35:40.740
I sold 15, three unfortunately
out of my 15 I can't sell

35:40.774 --> 35:42.709
which means you're
going to accept 12,

35:42.742 --> 35:44.277
those contracts
are gonna go out

35:44.310 --> 35:46.613
when I push "send"
on this thing.

35:46.646 --> 35:49.449
But when you sell them,
I want to be the broker,

35:49.482 --> 35:51.084
and I want to get paid
when they sell.

35:51.117 --> 35:53.520
'Cause I already sold them.

35:53.553 --> 35:57.757
I feel like only in the event
she puts them back,

35:57.791 --> 35:59.759
<i>she has to come to me</i>
<i>and sell them.</i>

35:59.793 --> 36:01.661
I don't want to see them
on some other broker's website

36:01.695 --> 36:02.896
in six months.

36:02.929 --> 36:04.698
It's just--it wouldn't
feel fair to me.

36:04.731 --> 36:05.832
- I'll discuss this with you

36:05.865 --> 36:08.435
when and if you
sell the project out.

36:08.468 --> 36:11.104
And if you don't
sell the project out,

36:11.137 --> 36:12.205
then I won't have
the prerogative

36:12.238 --> 36:15.475
to do whatever it is
that I need to do.

36:15.508 --> 36:16.743
- No, because--

36:16.776 --> 36:18.278
- You don't need to be
negotiating with me now.

36:18.311 --> 36:20.046
- No, because
you keep changing it on me.

36:20.046 --> 36:21.915
- I'm giving you
48 of the units.

36:21.948 --> 36:23.149
You should be happy
with that.

36:23.183 --> 36:24.951
- You're giving me 48--
you gave me 60.

36:25.051 --> 36:26.786
Now you're giving me 48.

36:26.820 --> 36:29.489
Why am I not getting paid
commission?

36:29.522 --> 36:30.523
- Let it go right now.

36:30.557 --> 36:32.359
- No, I'm going
to leave this lunch

36:32.392 --> 36:35.328
and I'm going to feel like I
should have stood up for myself.

36:35.362 --> 36:36.363
- Fredrik, I'm not changing.

36:36.396 --> 36:37.364
- That's not--
that's not cool.

36:37.397 --> 36:38.698
That's not cool.

36:38.732 --> 36:39.899
- Well, that's the way
it's going to go.

36:39.933 --> 36:41.067
- No, it's not the way
it's going to go.

36:41.067 --> 36:42.569
- It is the way
it's going to go.

36:42.602 --> 36:46.940
- Tomorrow, you're going
to hire another broker.

36:46.973 --> 36:50.110
- So you're telling me
that you're quitting the job?

36:50.143 --> 36:53.880
- I'm telling you that,
if we can't agree on this,

36:53.913 --> 36:56.383
you're going to hire
another broker.

36:56.416 --> 36:57.584
- There's nothing to discuss.

Probably, yes.

38:15.095 --> 38:16.162
This is ridiculous.

This is absolutely going
to kill this deal.

to sit with the sellers

38:42.355 --> 38:44.491

- Okay, so today's been
a great day.

38:49.462 --> 38:51.164
We have two
very concrete offers.

38:51.197 --> 38:52.165
- Okay.

38:52.198 --> 38:53.667

38:53.700 --> 38:57.437
Jordan's buyer came up
all the way to 2.250.

38:57.470 --> 38:58.538
That is their best and final

38:58.571 --> 39:00.740

come up anymore.

39:00.774 --> 39:03.009
The other broker, Joanna,
from Allemand,

39:03.043 --> 39:05.645
came up to 2.3 million.

39:05.679 --> 39:06.746
Yes, that's right.

39:06.780 --> 39:07.747
Joanna's buyer came up

39:07.781 --> 39:10.784

39:10.817 --> 39:12.152
It's not because of her
or her clients.

It's because of me.

I'm that good.

39:14.688 --> 39:15.655
Understand?

39:15.689 --> 39:16.823
I'm joking.
It was Joanna.

39:16.856 --> 39:19.893
I think that 2.3 million
is a very good number.

39:19.926 --> 39:23.029

about it is this.

39:23.029 --> 39:25.532
It's such an artistic,
exclusive piece,

39:25.565 --> 39:29.135
and, for that exclusivity,
I want full price.

39:29.169 --> 39:31.905
- Honestly, I think it's
a very, very good number.

39:31.938 --> 39:32.939
I really think so.

39:33.039 --> 39:34.774
Nobody wants to be the first.

39:34.808 --> 39:36.309
Once we get a sale,

39:36.343 --> 39:38.244
I think the second,
the penthouse would sell,

39:38.278 --> 39:39.913
the next projects that you do
would be a little bit easier.

39:39.946 --> 39:41.815
- I see that
from the buyer's perspective,

39:41.848 --> 39:43.083
but from the seller's
perspective,

39:43.116 --> 39:44.884
I feel they're
getting a bargain.

39:44.918 --> 39:46.853
I really think
they're getting a bargain.

39:46.886 --> 39:47.954
- Can I--can I
ask you something?

39:48.054 --> 39:49.856
- Yes.
- If they were to leave today,

39:49.889 --> 39:52.325
they don't want to pay
full ask--

39:52.359 --> 39:53.727
- Uh-huh.
- Would you be okay with that?

39:53.760 --> 39:55.628
- Um, I think we would wait.

39:55.662 --> 39:57.464
Yes, I think we would wait,
because the neighborhood,

39:57.497 --> 39:59.432

going on there,

39:59.466 --> 40:01.501

offered them a counter.

we're going to lose them,

40:07.841 --> 40:10.010
is shooting yourself
in the foot.

Go get us the best price.

I gave them your offer, but uh,

41:05.765 --> 41:07.167
there's something
you need to understand

41:07.200 --> 41:09.502
and this is actually coming
from the seller themselves.

41:09.536 --> 41:13.073
They priced this unit
specifically to not negotiate.

41:13.073 --> 41:14.741
They think that the price
is fair,

41:14.774 --> 41:17.644

a deal unless it's full ask.
