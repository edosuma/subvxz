13:00.992 --> 13:02.649
So pathetic.

13:07.017 --> 13:09.031
I was actually impressed
that you had the courage

13:09.056 --> 13:11.556
to try to finish that
serum of yours in secret.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.036
I had no choice.

13:14.275 --> 13:16.923
Being with you was destroying me.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.676
But do you see the irony?

13:21.101 --> 13:23.379
Being separate is...

13:25.683 --> 13:27.716
what's going to destroy you.

13:30.321 --> 13:32.721

13:38.685 --> 13:39.685

13:41.016 --> 13:42.284
I don't think so, mate!

[Both grunting]

13:43.401 --> 13:44.515
[Crashing]

13:47.505 --> 13:50.205

[Grunting]

13:53.454 --> 13:54.621
Doctor.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.627
I told you to run.

13:56.652 --> 13:58.585
No. You risked everything to save us.

13:58.783 --> 13:59.915
We had to do the same.

13:59.984 --> 14:01.454
To be clear, I was fine running.

14:01.479 --> 14:03.880
Now I'm going to kill you all.

14:09.293 --> 14:12.094
Leave it. It's of no use to us now.

14:12.163 --> 14:14.730
And we don't want to be
here when he wakes up.

14:16.866 --> 14:18.684
Have you any idea what you've just done?

14:18.709 --> 14:21.277
Stopped you from hurting
my moms and anybody else.

14:21.302 --> 14:23.536
You stopped me from rescuing Belle,

14:24.023 --> 14:25.277
not to mention your family,

14:25.302 --> 14:27.356
and they're trapped in
the same realm with her!

14:28.786 --> 14:30.684
What's he talking about?

14:31.786 --> 14:35.582
David, Snow, Hook, and Zelena
are in another realm right now.

14:36.187 --> 14:37.886
And thanks to you,

14:38.169 --> 14:40.003
we have no way of helping them get back.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.423
I did what I had to.

14:41.655 --> 14:42.591
This isn't on me.

14:42.660 --> 14:43.660
It's on you.

14:44.365 --> 14:45.014
Henry.

14:45.039 --> 14:46.359
I'll make sure he doesn't go far.

14:47.597 --> 14:48.950
Storybrooke.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.100
Henry rid it of its magic.

14:51.168 --> 14:52.277
What happened to it?

14:52.302 --> 14:54.733
Storybrooke survived for
28 years without magic.

14:54.758 --> 14:56.324
I'm sure it can manage a few more.

14:56.367 --> 14:57.507
You said it would be destroyed.

14:57.532 --> 15:00.853
Yes, when I had to motivate
you to find your wayward son.

15:00.878 --> 15:02.511
What should we do? Call the police?

15:02.580 --> 15:04.360
See how he does without
his powers in a real prison?

15:04.385 --> 15:05.484
That's an excellent idea.

15:05.509 --> 15:07.692
Not if you want my help
finding the one person

15:07.717 --> 15:08.895
who may still have magic.

15:08.920 --> 15:09.869
What are you talking about?

15:09.894 --> 15:11.263
You said this was a land without magic!

15:11.288 --> 15:13.388
It is. And it isn't.

15:14.137 --> 15:16.041
Enough with the riddles. Who has magic?

15:16.066 --> 15:17.475
Well, for that answer, it looks like

15:17.500 --> 15:19.734
we're just gonna have to
learn to work together now.

15:21.265 --> 15:22.225
All right, I'll go with Gold

15:22.250 --> 15:24.210
and make sure he keeps
his hands off this crystal.

15:24.586 --> 15:25.634
You find Henry.

15:25.703 --> 15:26.703
[Sighs]

15:34.872 --> 15:36.745
Hey. Can we have a second?

15:36.814 --> 15:38.147
Of course.

15:42.577 --> 15:44.210
How'd you know where to find me?

15:44.235 --> 15:45.559
Because when we lived in New York,

15:45.584 --> 15:47.317
this is where we came
when you were upset.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.684
And I'd give you a penny

15:48.709 --> 15:50.234
and tell you to wish your problems away.

15:50.259 --> 15:51.658
Remember?

15:51.910 --> 15:53.209
What do you say?

15:53.547 --> 15:54.830
Want to give it a try?

15:54.899 --> 15:56.099
I'm sorry, Mom, but that's not

15:56.133 --> 15:57.333
gonna make me feel better now.

15:57.671 --> 15:58.421
Why not?

15:58.446 --> 16:01.710
When we lived here,
there wasn't any magic.

16:02.406 --> 16:03.783
We didn't even know it existed.

16:03.808 --> 16:05.607
And, Mom, we were happy.

16:07.790 --> 16:08.832
We were.

16:09.512 --> 16:11.915
And I wouldn't trade
that time for anything.

16:12.450 --> 16:13.766
But you're forgetting something.

16:14.196 --> 16:15.718
It was just the two
of us. And now...

16:15.743 --> 16:16.813
Yeah.

16:17.521 --> 16:19.884
And that's why I thought
if I destroyed magic

16:19.909 --> 16:22.209
in Storybrooke that
we could all be happy

16:22.776 --> 16:23.759
like you and I were.

16:23.784 --> 16:25.665
But because of what I did,

16:26.463 --> 16:28.842
we'll never even see
half of our family again.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.533
That may not be true.

16:30.934 --> 16:33.535
Your mom is with Gold
to try to find a way.

16:35.206 --> 16:36.726
Should we see if they had any luck?

16:42.235 --> 16:44.179
Why didn't you believe me

16:44.657 --> 16:46.381
when I told you I wanted to help you?

16:46.450 --> 16:48.817
[Scoffs] Wondering if
you've lost your edge?

16:48.959 --> 16:51.653
Or hoping you finally
managed to bury the Evil Queen

16:51.678 --> 16:53.822
deep enough inside
that I wouldn't buy it?

16:53.847 --> 16:55.324
Don't try to psychoanalyze me.

16:55.349 --> 16:58.293
Look. Let me give you a
friendly piece of advice.

16:58.613 --> 17:00.662
Partitioning the darkness inside

17:00.902 --> 17:03.794
will not help you become
the woman you want to be.

17:04.779 --> 17:06.034
It worked so far.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.435
Has it?

17:08.415 --> 17:10.215
You know, I once thought I
could contain the darkness

17:10.241 --> 17:12.575
to one tiny corner of my soul.

17:12.777 --> 17:15.243
First for Baelfire, then for Belle.

17:15.356 --> 17:17.333
And I always failed.
Do you want to know why?

17:17.675 --> 17:20.492
Because I like the darkness.

17:21.292 --> 17:23.126
It's as much who I am as the light.

17:23.704 --> 17:26.320
Why can't you seem to
grasp it's not either/or?

17:26.390 --> 17:27.936
Because I'm not like you.

17:28.827 --> 17:31.347
I don't like the darkness.

17:32.230 --> 17:34.163
You can tell yourself what you like.

17:34.315 --> 17:38.101
But deep down, the Evil
Queen is who you are.

17:38.732 --> 17:40.826
And the more you keep her locked inside,

17:41.619 --> 17:43.586
the more you're gonna suffer.

17:50.242 --> 17:51.947
What the hell is this place?

17:55.304 --> 17:57.037
Greetings.

17:57.154 --> 17:59.254
What brings you to my humble shop?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.004
Well, we're in the market for something

18:01.029 --> 18:03.362
a little more powerful than
what you have on display.

18:03.508 --> 18:06.542
If you mean narcotics, I'm
just a simple herbalist.

18:06.801 --> 18:07.863
I don't think so.

18:08.201 --> 18:10.999
Regina, meet The Dragon.

18:13.596 --> 18:15.270
Good to see you're breathing again.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.428
I hear one of my father's
minions paid you a visit.

18:17.541 --> 18:20.501
Peter Pan was powerful,
but I'm resilient.

18:21.278 --> 18:24.313
I assume you're here
because you want something,

18:24.649 --> 18:26.645
Rumplestiltskin.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.130
But I'm afraid I'm not in the business

18:30.155 --> 18:32.855
of helping hearts filled
with such darkness.

18:32.985 --> 18:34.306
Gold, this is a waste of time.

18:34.331 --> 18:35.404
But you...

18:36.373 --> 18:38.029
you I will help.

18:39.244 --> 18:43.635
I see a noble battle deep
inside your soul, Regina,

18:44.518 --> 18:46.750
between light and dark.

18:47.497 --> 18:52.033
And for that, I will
do my best to aid you.

18:53.506 --> 18:56.073
It is imperative you win...

18:56.423 --> 18:58.323
for all of us.

19:23.136 --> 19:25.536
[Whooshing]

19:34.614 --> 19:36.314
There. Look.

19:38.513 --> 19:39.578
Where the hell is that?

19:39.617 --> 19:41.884
Wherever it is, they're in trouble.

19:42.321 --> 19:44.054
We need to get through
so we can help them.

19:56.942 --> 19:59.008
[Sighs]

19:59.254 --> 20:04.243
I'm afraid opening a portal to
that realm is beyond my power.

20:04.292 --> 20:05.925
You can't give up.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.255
My family, they're in trouble.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.579
I've done all I can.

20:10.682 --> 20:11.682
But you...

20:13.462 --> 20:14.851
you haven't.

20:16.121 --> 20:17.181
Me?

20:17.423 --> 20:18.931
All of you.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.253
Just because the boy
destroyed Storybrooke's magic

20:21.278 --> 20:23.145
doesn't mean there
isn't any in this world.

20:23.170 --> 20:24.803
Oh, really? Because I
think there's a reason

20:24.828 --> 20:27.595
they call this place
The Land Without Magic.

20:27.729 --> 20:30.296
Yes, because that's how it appears.

20:31.456 --> 20:35.392
There's magic everywhere
if you're willing to see it.

20:35.957 --> 20:37.313
That sounds an awful lot like something

20:37.338 --> 20:39.338
a friend told me a long time ago.

20:39.657 --> 20:40.731
August?

20:41.681 --> 20:42.683
Yes.

20:43.889 --> 20:47.600
I know who you are, Savior.

20:48.590 --> 20:52.656
If you want to find magic, remember...

20:54.140 --> 20:55.773
what he taught you.

20:57.686 --> 20:58.919
"You have to believe."

21:01.800 --> 21:03.833
So, how do you suggest we do that?

21:04.487 --> 21:07.855
After all, saying you
believe doesn't make it so.

21:10.159 --> 21:12.159
I know how.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.906
Regina: How is that going to help us?

21:15.931 --> 21:17.343
Because there's magic in it.

21:18.034 --> 21:19.900
Every time someone makes a wish.

21:20.105 --> 21:21.908
I don't think throwing
a coin in a fountain

21:21.933 --> 21:24.000
is what The Dragon was talking about.

21:24.437 --> 21:25.898
All due respect, Grandpa,

21:26.205 --> 21:28.476
but I think that was exactly
what he was talking about.

21:31.292 --> 21:33.186
Mom, when we were living in New York,

21:33.211 --> 21:35.382
do you remember the last
time you took me here?

21:35.407 --> 21:37.841
Yeah. I don't know. You
were upset about something.

21:38.055 --> 21:39.095
Maybe something at school?

21:39.143 --> 21:40.360
It was because of you.

21:40.923 --> 21:42.323
I could tell you were lonely,

21:42.547 --> 21:44.044
so I wished our family
would be complete,

21:44.069 --> 21:46.236
and do you know what
happened a few days later?

21:46.556 --> 21:47.967
Hook came to New York,

21:48.733 --> 21:49.931
and he brought us back to Storybrooke

21:49.956 --> 21:51.489
and we were reunited with our family.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.134
There was magic.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.735
It was right here.

21:54.804 --> 21:56.137
We just didn't know it.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.499
Don't you see?

21:57.575 --> 21:59.408
We just need to wish they were back.

22:03.598 --> 22:06.147
I wish we were reunited with our family.

22:10.384 --> 22:11.139
Come on.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.398
It can't just be me.

22:13.634 --> 22:15.534
Everybody make a wish.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.684
This will work. I promise.

25:04.350 --> 25:05.849
Here, come on.

25:10.066 --> 25:12.199
[Coins splashing]

25:28.226 --> 25:30.116
He's actually restoring magic.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.520
See?

25:33.545 --> 25:35.512
I told you.

25:41.864 --> 25:43.163
[Coin clanks]

25:44.700 --> 25:45.532
[Water splashes]

25:45.601 --> 25:47.634
[Coins clinking]

25:55.244 --> 25:56.499
Pennies.

25:57.346 --> 26:00.214
- [Whoosh!]
- [Crowd gasping]

26:05.321 --> 26:07.588
[Coins clinking]

26:08.387 --> 26:09.690
Not pennies, David.

26:10.672 --> 26:11.710
Wishes.

26:12.487 --> 26:13.724
I don't care who's making them.

26:13.749 --> 26:15.115
Let's get out of here!

26:20.836 --> 26:22.603
[Whoosh!]

26:27.262 --> 26:28.766
Dad.

26:30.715 --> 26:31.988
Mom!

26:37.404 --> 26:38.619
I knew you'd find us, Swan.

26:39.030 --> 26:41.264
It wasn't me this
time. It was all Henry.

26:42.391 --> 26:44.291
[Cheers and applause]

26:55.828 --> 26:57.204
Henry.

26:57.229 --> 26:59.029
They think it was all an act.

27:01.343 --> 27:02.810
It's okay, Henry.

27:02.835 --> 27:05.195
This is the only way
they can understand.

27:06.303 --> 27:08.916
But for a moment, they believed.

27:08.984 --> 27:10.485
For a moment, you...

27:11.305 --> 27:12.352
you did the impossible.

27:12.377 --> 27:15.879
You made the world believe.

27:25.351 --> 27:27.051
[Glass shatters]

27:27.229 --> 27:29.295
[Screams]

27:30.101 --> 27:33.669
Still battling against
your better half, I see.

27:36.668 --> 27:38.114
And failing.

27:39.441 --> 27:43.043
So, you made it through that portal.

27:43.252 --> 27:45.623
I'm never one to miss an opportunity.

27:46.297 --> 27:47.742
Of course not.

27:47.767 --> 27:53.743
And now that you're finally
here, Rumplestiltskin,

27:54.462 --> 27:57.096
you're going to help me win that battle.

27:57.415 --> 28:00.293
Because if you ever
wish to see your wife

28:00.318 --> 28:03.520
or your child-to-be again,

28:03.707 --> 28:05.807
you'll do as I ask.

28:06.302 --> 28:07.801
[Gasps]

28:07.826 --> 28:10.014
The only deal I'm gonna make with you

28:10.039 --> 28:12.272
is the one where you
return that box to me,

28:12.297 --> 28:15.832
and then, I suppose, you get to live.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.789
[Choking] I can help you...

28:19.342 --> 28:20.971
wake Belle.

28:25.821 --> 28:27.187
[Gasping, coughing]

28:27.256 --> 28:28.755
What did you just say?

28:28.799 --> 28:30.755
I know that she's
under a sleeping curse.

28:30.780 --> 28:34.906
I can provide you with the
information to wake her.

28:34.931 --> 28:36.231
You're lying,

28:36.388 --> 28:38.355
thinking it'll save your skin.

28:38.683 --> 28:40.411
Am I, now?

28:40.436 --> 28:43.170
[Panting]

28:44.419 --> 28:49.355
I've been the warden here to
many from all distant lands.

28:49.590 --> 28:51.223
I've learned much.

28:51.486 --> 28:53.817
There is one place

28:54.936 --> 28:57.836
that had the answer you seek.

29:01.492 --> 29:02.492
Where?

29:05.861 --> 29:11.298
I think it's time that
we talk about a deal.

29:14.173 --> 29:15.789
I'll never be able to thank you enough

29:15.814 --> 29:17.764
for coming back to save me.

29:18.439 --> 29:19.893
Now that I'm separated
from that monster,

29:19.918 --> 29:22.719
I can make a fresh start of
my life in your Storybrooke.

29:24.364 --> 29:25.997
Hook: Still missing a crocodile.

29:26.261 --> 29:27.366
Gold wasn't in the park?

29:27.391 --> 29:29.135
In all the commotion, he
must have slipped through

29:29.160 --> 29:30.527
the portal to find Belle.

29:30.552 --> 29:32.319
Where's Regina? Wasn't she
out there looking with you?

29:32.380 --> 29:35.888
No. She said she wanted to be
alone, but she wouldn't say why.

29:35.987 --> 29:37.635
Emma, this couldn't still
be about the squabble

29:37.660 --> 29:38.892
you two had in Storybrooke, could it?

29:38.961 --> 29:40.251
No, we solved that.

29:40.696 --> 29:42.162
I know what this is.

29:42.321 --> 29:43.989
It's something bigger.

29:49.905 --> 29:52.706
[Siren wailing in distance]

29:58.293 --> 29:59.637
Hey.

30:00.957 --> 30:03.411
I thought you might like
something to keep you warm.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.841
You know I don't do
hot cocoa with cinnamon.

30:07.030 --> 30:08.555
I know.

30:10.526 --> 30:12.426
Emma told me what's going on with you.

30:15.524 --> 30:17.391
You don't have to go through this alone.

30:19.538 --> 30:22.072
Well, I'm afraid that I do.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.256
If I want to keep the Evil Queen at bay,

30:24.281 --> 30:29.833
I have to open myself up to
a life of pain and suffering.

30:31.735 --> 30:33.801
And if I don't keep her at bay...

30:37.319 --> 30:38.752
Well, that's just not an option.

30:39.031 --> 30:40.187
There has to be something we can do.

30:40.212 --> 30:42.679
There isn't. Trust me.

30:44.860 --> 30:47.786
I even made a second
wish at the fountain.

30:48.418 --> 30:49.673
I wished the Evil Queen away

30:49.698 --> 30:52.265
so I can be free of everything she did.

30:54.203 --> 30:55.602
I did.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.040
We forgive you, you know.

31:02.902 --> 31:05.488
The problem is, as
long as she's inside me,

31:06.482 --> 31:07.684
that doesn't matter.

31:08.617 --> 31:13.053
Her baggage, her karma...
call it what you want...

31:14.600 --> 31:16.662
will always be there.

31:18.514 --> 31:20.725
Just another useless wish.

31:22.334 --> 31:23.855
You want a fresh start.

31:26.004 --> 31:28.238
I don't know for sure, Regina,

31:29.301 --> 31:31.580
but maybe that wish can
come true, after all.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.374
How?

31:36.041 --> 31:38.682
Jekyll said he didn't know how
to thank us, but he found a way.

31:39.150 --> 31:41.281
He grabbed this before we fled the lab.

31:41.439 --> 31:44.251
It's the serum that
split him from Mr. Hyde.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.735
He said there's enough
left for another dose.

31:47.261 --> 31:49.194
And you think this will work on me?

31:49.240 --> 31:52.765
I believe that this could
be the end of the Evil Queen,

31:52.790 --> 31:55.358
as long as you're sure
that's what you want.

31:56.965 --> 31:58.331
I want her gone.

31:58.621 --> 31:59.733
Then let's get rid of her.

32:00.277 --> 32:01.902
Let's be the family we
were always meant to be.

32:01.927 --> 32:03.427
All of us.

32:05.354 --> 32:06.753
Go downstairs.

32:06.878 --> 32:08.788
Jekyll said there will be
a moment of disorientation

32:08.813 --> 32:10.595
when the Evil Queen
won't have her magic.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.387
That's your chance. You cannot hesitate.

32:12.459 --> 32:13.459
Understood.

32:13.882 --> 32:16.550
Now, please, leave me.

32:16.575 --> 32:17.851
I'm staying.

32:17.934 --> 32:19.434
I'm staying, too.

32:19.695 --> 32:21.399
I was there when the
Evil Queen was born.

32:21.424 --> 32:24.826
I kind of helped bring
her into the world.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.173
I want to see you end her.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.104
Get ready to stand back, because...

32:33.848 --> 32:35.409
[Sighs] I have a feeling
we're about to meet

32:35.434 --> 32:37.401
a very angry queen,

32:37.573 --> 32:39.469
and she didn't like you on a good day.

32:40.414 --> 32:41.174
Emma.

32:41.243 --> 32:42.534
I'm ready.

32:52.945 --> 32:55.518
[Groaning]

33:08.570 --> 33:10.971
[Screams]

33:18.389 --> 33:20.189
[Grunts]

33:22.180 --> 33:23.579
[Grunts]

33:35.913 --> 33:39.115
Look at what you've become.

33:43.815 --> 33:45.514
[Chains rattling]

33:48.069 --> 33:49.802
[Groans]

33:50.509 --> 33:53.817
Regina, now's your chance. Destroy her.

33:55.250 --> 33:58.218
[Chuckles]

33:58.592 --> 34:01.296
You destroy me?

34:02.639 --> 34:04.576
You don't have what it takes.

34:08.050 --> 34:09.518
Regina.

34:10.551 --> 34:12.399
You're weak.

34:22.045 --> 34:26.547
No matter what you do, you
can't destroy our darkness.

34:28.871 --> 34:31.705
Deep down inside, you know the truth.

34:35.768 --> 34:37.699
You need me.

34:42.742 --> 34:43.929
No.

34:45.788 --> 34:46.789
I don't.

34:49.002 --> 34:50.568
[Gasps]

34:50.592 --> 34:52.693
[Heart beating]

34:56.389 --> 34:57.628
I'm sorry.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.203
[Sighs] Home sweet home.

35:40.825 --> 35:43.152
And in one piece.

35:49.443 --> 35:51.022
I have to go, Henry.

35:51.134 --> 35:53.101
My dad... I need to talk to him.

35:53.271 --> 35:54.111
Good luck.

35:54.136 --> 35:55.922
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble

35:55.947 --> 35:58.180
for missing everyone's
trip back to Camelot.

35:58.233 --> 35:59.393
It's okay.

36:01.135 --> 36:04.730
There's something...
something I haven't told you.

36:06.460 --> 36:10.763
My father didn't go back,
because he isn't from Camelot.

36:11.534 --> 36:13.379
It's just a place he wound up in.

36:13.404 --> 36:15.304
I... I don't understand.

36:15.682 --> 36:18.710
He's originally from here, this land.

36:19.168 --> 36:20.937
From a place called Connecticut.

36:21.969 --> 36:22.805
What?

36:22.830 --> 36:24.778
He never felt at home
in Camelot, you know?

36:24.803 --> 36:27.337
He... he always said he was
glad that I was born there

36:27.362 --> 36:29.861
because, "being a Connecticut Yankee

36:29.886 --> 36:32.625
in King Arthur's court
is no great shakes."

36:33.422 --> 36:34.781
I don't know what great shakes are,

36:34.806 --> 36:37.440
but I do know that I like it here.

36:50.050 --> 36:52.083
[Giggles]

36:58.825 --> 36:59.848
Really?

36:59.974 --> 37:03.455
So, I'm guessing Operation
Mixtape was a success?

37:03.480 --> 37:05.213
Mom. Come on.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.605
We still need to un-tether
the magic from this thing.

37:24.265 --> 37:26.065
[Sighs]

37:27.386 --> 37:29.004
It's even lovelier than you described.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.135
Well, follow me. We'll show you around.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.640
First stop Granny's.

37:33.741 --> 37:35.241
Emma: Killian.

37:35.822 --> 37:38.214
What is it, love? You don't still
feel guilty about my return, do you?

37:38.239 --> 37:41.059
No. Just after everything
we've been through...

37:41.513 --> 37:44.832
darkness, Hades, being
separated by realms...

37:45.920 --> 37:48.587
I just wanted to say something,

37:48.656 --> 37:51.523
you know, when we're not in
the middle of a big battle

37:51.592 --> 37:54.397
or one of us is facing death,

37:55.030 --> 37:57.959
when things are just normal.

37:58.368 --> 38:00.468
And what's that, Swan?

38:06.568 --> 38:07.867
I love you.

38:19.210 --> 38:22.147
Well, you did it, Mom. You
destroyed the Evil Queen.

38:22.667 --> 38:23.966
How do you feel?

38:27.194 --> 38:28.194
Free.

38:31.319 --> 38:35.367
Now let's make sure no one
can ever steal this again.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.874
[Rumbling]

38:45.613 --> 38:47.613
[Wind whistling]

38:56.924 --> 38:58.857
[Rumbling stops]

39:04.892 --> 39:06.952
Thank you for that.

39:07.767 --> 39:10.536
I'd hate to be trapped in
this town without magic.

39:10.561 --> 39:13.496
That would be truly barbaric.

39:13.998 --> 39:15.307
Mr. Hyde.

39:15.376 --> 39:17.042
How did you get here?

39:17.341 --> 39:18.537
Gold.

39:19.803 --> 39:21.869
He made a deal with you, didn't he?

39:22.100 --> 39:23.649
Yes, that he did.

39:23.842 --> 39:26.752
I provided him with some information

39:26.777 --> 39:30.512
in exchange for Storybrooke.

39:30.723 --> 39:32.157
Excuse me?

39:32.295 --> 39:34.326
Storybrooke is mine now.

39:34.470 --> 39:36.929
And I brought some friends.

39:45.138 --> 39:48.344
You know, I've been looking
for a place like this

39:48.369 --> 39:50.002
for quite some time...

39:50.027 --> 39:53.967
A land where all the world's
lost and forgotten stories

39:53.992 --> 39:55.681
could play themselves out.

39:55.706 --> 39:57.713
And now that I have brought them here,

39:58.775 --> 40:01.754
that is exactly what
they're going to do.

40:01.822 --> 40:05.521
Let me tell you something, "Mr. Hyde."

40:06.674 --> 40:08.592
I know how your story ends.

40:08.943 --> 40:10.462
You lose.

40:10.531 --> 40:13.198
I wouldn't bet on it, Regina.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.701
Despite what you may think,

40:15.901 --> 40:20.272
darkness is not as easy to snuff out

40:21.213 --> 40:22.841
as you might believe.

40:31.865 --> 40:33.965
[Wind whistling]

40:46.520 --> 40:48.854
[Wind chime jingles]

40:53.174 --> 40:56.008
[Wind whistling]

41:14.156 --> 41:15.661
Evil Queen.

41:15.686 --> 41:19.237
Regina never should
have let me out to play.

41:20.138 --> 41:21.633
What are you doing here?

41:21.973 --> 41:24.991
I came to set the record straight.

41:25.666 --> 41:28.015
You were right about one thing, Dragon.

41:28.476 --> 41:33.212
There was a battle raging inside Regina.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.512
And she may have won the fight,

41:36.644 --> 41:37.896
but this...

41:39.466 --> 41:41.314
is a war.

41:43.491 --> 41:45.554
And it's just begun.

41:47.027 --> 41:48.636
[Gasps]

41:48.661 --> 41:49.668
Oh!

41:49.693 --> 41:51.126
[Heart beating]

41:54.488 --> 41:58.592
The Queen is back.
