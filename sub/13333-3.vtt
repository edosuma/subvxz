WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.235
.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.376
Geordie Shore is back in Newcastle.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.177
Home sweet fucking home.

00:11.244 --> 00:14.647
(cheering)
We're back with a fucking boom.

00:18.585 --> 00:19.719
Get in.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.159
Come on.
And bang!

00:28.294 --> 00:30.897
She's a slut.
It's Marnie!

00:30.964 --> 00:33.466
It's me baby cousin Marnie.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.536
I wanna get pissed with the lads.

00:36.603 --> 00:40.039
She feels like she runs the house.
I do like Scott.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.308
I'm gonna cock-block him.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.145
Shut up. It's pissing us off.

00:48.148 --> 00:51.785
Egg is really poorly,
this is a fish emergency.

00:51.851 --> 00:53.987
Everyone's smashed.

00:54.053 --> 00:55.522
You've fucking shit yourself!

00:55.588 --> 00:59.025
I like Scott.
If he likes us he needs to show it.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.862
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.131
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.934
I'm a natural beauty, real boobs,
real hair.

01:08.001 --> 01:10.303
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.505
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.541
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.177
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.180
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.649
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

01:39.165 --> 01:43.837
I've woke up and the first thing on
my mind is Egg, I hope he's OK.

01:43.903 --> 01:46.339
(phone rings)

01:46.406 --> 01:48.208
Hi, Craig how are you?

01:49.843 --> 01:50.844
Ahhh.

01:53.646 --> 01:55.648
Egg's dead.

02:04.724 --> 02:08.794
Egg was me favourite. I didn't want
to tell anyone but I've said it.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.337
I'm taking Scott to pick up
Egg's body cos I know

02:17.403 --> 02:22.208
if I fall into an emotional wreck,
Scott will pick us up, he's muscly.

02:24.043 --> 02:27.680
I feel sorry for Charlotte
cos she loved those fish to bits

02:27.747 --> 02:29.415
but this is really weird.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.652
You've got three options.
Right.

02:32.719 --> 02:36.055
One, you can flush him
down the toilet. Uh-huh.

02:36.122 --> 02:39.459
Two, you can bury him,
three, you can cremate him.

02:39.526 --> 02:43.429
Flush, bury or cremate.
But where's option four, scran?

02:50.603 --> 02:54.007
You all right?
You all right? Sad?

02:54.073 --> 02:56.109
This is a sad day.

02:56.175 --> 02:59.979
I'm distraught, Scott doesn't know
what to do and I'm looking at Craig

03:00.046 --> 03:05.418
I can see in his eyes cos he didn't
save Egg, he's beating himself up.

03:05.485 --> 03:09.155
All right? Thanks, Craig.
No problem. Thanks so much.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.628
All right?
Yeah.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.137
We're at the crematorium,

03:24.203 --> 03:27.674
getting ready for the huge flames
that will engulf him.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.650
(gasps)

03:37.717 --> 03:41.988
Oh, my God, what...? That's it?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.823
That's all?

03:43.890 --> 03:48.127
I've shaved off more pubes
than that. Oh!

03:48.194 --> 03:53.466
Small pile of dust. I get more when
I clean the shelves in the house.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.134
Thanks bye.
Bye-bye.

04:01.507 --> 04:03.643
Speak of the devil.
How'd it go?

04:03.710 --> 04:06.746
Egg's been cremated
Oh, my God.

04:06.813 --> 04:10.316
We're gonna have a proper funeral
for him later on today.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.419
So I'd like everyone to wear black.
OK.

04:13.486 --> 04:18.324
Full black. Obviously I'm gonna be
wearing orange in memory of Egg.

04:18.391 --> 04:21.060
Aww, that's so cute.

04:21.127 --> 04:25.632
We're gonna have a funeral. I don't
know if I've got a black vest.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.135
Lads,
you can carry Egg's coffin down.

04:29.202 --> 04:33.306
I'm so happy they've all made the
effort. Egg would've loved this.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.975
I can't believe he's dead.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.585
This is the perfect place
to say goodbye to Egg.

04:45.652 --> 04:51.057
The waves are crashing and the sun's
shinning down. It's so beautiful.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.127
It is sad that Egg's died,

04:54.193 --> 04:57.664
Charlotte's upset and she genuinely
did love them fucking fish.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.400
I didn't have a clue,
which one Egg was.

05:00.466 --> 05:04.771
I'm so glad that you've all been
able to make it today.

05:04.837 --> 05:10.009
From the day we got Egg, we all know
how much of a happy fish he was.

05:10.076 --> 05:13.579
The happiest. He shimmered,
his scales were beautiful.

05:13.646 --> 05:18.051
The orange-ness of him was
just better than my tan.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.320
He always wanted to be
part of the Buck Squad.

05:21.387 --> 05:26.826
I know I should feel sad but I just
feel stupid, saying bye to a fish.

05:26.893 --> 05:30.163
Marnie, I know you didn't get
to know Egg very much.

05:30.229 --> 05:33.933
I just wish I got to know Egg
a little bit more.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.137
I'm feeling left out cos I didn't
know Egg and everyone else did.

05:38.204 --> 05:41.607
It's reminding us that I'm not
part of this family yet.

05:41.674 --> 05:45.311
Goodbye, Egg. (all) Goodbye, Egg.
I loved you.

05:46.412 --> 05:51.417
I know that once I spread Egg's
ashes in the sea, he's gone forever.

05:51.484 --> 05:55.254
Until I die and I get my ashes
spread in the sea

05:55.321 --> 05:56.956
and we're together again,

05:57.023 --> 06:01.060
holding hands swimming through
the ocean, just like dolphins.

06:01.127 --> 06:04.997
(all) Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Oh, God, he's gone!

06:05.064 --> 06:06.966
(all) Bye.
Bye, Egg.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.871
Right, anyone fancy fish and chips?

06:20.046 --> 06:22.849
Everyone's down after Vicky
leaving and Egg's funeral

06:22.915 --> 06:25.918
so now to get the whole family
back together,

06:25.985 --> 06:28.287
we're gonna tick off
Marnie's bucket list.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.693
So my bucket list idea
is fire walking.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.729
I've always wanted to do it.
I'm really excited.

06:36.796 --> 06:40.299
I feel everyone needs a lift.
A lift? Oh, yeah, wicked.

06:40.366 --> 06:44.003
Fire walking, to me that's sounds
dangerous, stupid and painful.

06:44.070 --> 06:48.307
When we're doing it we'll all be
laughing. We'll be on fire.

06:48.374 --> 06:52.078
This will be a piece of piss.
I'm already hot as fuck.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.588
Ooh!

07:04.357 --> 07:08.361
I'm not gonna run across fire,
I'm not an idiot.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.667
This shit got real.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.604
(excited squealing)

07:24.410 --> 07:28.681
That was fucking easy. I wanna go
again and do the fucking worm.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.583
(shouting)

07:33.753 --> 07:35.388
Go on, Marnie!

07:35.454 --> 07:40.893
I'm the first girl to try it. I have
to do it or I'll look like a twat.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.701
I've got smoke in me eyes!

07:48.768 --> 07:53.606
I've done it. It was fine. I don't
know what all the fuss was about.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.008
I bet I could walk across water.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.611
(cheering)

07:58.678 --> 08:01.981
I'm proud of everyone
giving my bucket list a go.

08:02.048 --> 08:06.452
It worked amazing and it's made
everyone feel really good.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.654
(cheering)

08:08.721 --> 08:12.959
After fire walking we have a few
drinks, some food, for Egg's wake.

08:14.327 --> 08:19.465
I'm gonna toast marshmallows
on a fire just like we toasted Egg.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.701
To Egg.
We'll miss you.

08:21.767 --> 08:26.339
Why don't we play truth or dare
cos we're all around the camp fire?

08:26.405 --> 08:29.308
We're playing truth or dare.
I know what's coming,

08:29.375 --> 08:32.010
it's gonna boil down
to me and Scott.

08:32.078 --> 08:35.514
There's nowt else going on,
all of them are boring.

08:37.884 --> 08:38.885
Nah.

08:38.951 --> 08:43.856
They wanna watch me and Marnie kiss
cos they're not getting any action.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.692
I feel like
I'm playing spin the bottle.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.427
Come here.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.496
It's embarrassing.

08:54.634 --> 08:58.604
So Marnie and Scott are kissing
in front of me face.

08:58.671 --> 09:03.409
I'm a bit jealous cos Scott's the lad
I used to get attention from

09:03.476 --> 09:05.912
but I can't say anything
about it.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.817
Aye, I do.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.186
All I've done with Marnie is kiss

09:14.253 --> 09:18.057
so when we neck on I'm going to have
a trident in me pants.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.927
(cheering)

09:22.628 --> 09:25.064
That could only happen at Egg's wake.

09:25.131 --> 09:28.301
Even though that was awkward,
I'm really pleased it happened

09:28.367 --> 09:31.504
cos now me and Scott
are out in the open.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.906
I hope everyone will leave us alone.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.041
Hiya.

09:36.375 --> 09:40.179
I fucking don't know what the hell's
going on me like.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.381
Well, how do you feel?

09:42.448 --> 09:45.051
When we're one-on-one,
there is a connection.

09:45.117 --> 09:48.788
We like each other but it's hard
to forget about everyone else.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.468
Yeah, but that's... Yeah.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.004
But like...
In a nutshell...

10:12.411 --> 10:16.749
We've agreed that when we sleep with
each other we won't pull others.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.585
He's gotta work harder
to get me into bed.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.496
It's my birthday.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.332
You can have a house party.
Bring it on!

10:33.399 --> 10:36.669
Dressing up like a slag
is the best thing ever.

10:36.736 --> 10:40.239
He needs to focus on washing
that Chlamydia off his cock.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.642
I'll teach you how to be sexy.
It's the fanny dance.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.613
Where's Sophie at? Fucking shit.
Don't expect it to be fucking rosy

10:47.680 --> 10:50.082
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

10:50.149 --> 10:52.551
.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.089
.

11:10.569 --> 11:16.609
# Holly, it's your day of birth
I hope you get a big girth

11:16.675 --> 11:20.479
# And I will watch
Because I'm a perv #

11:20.546 --> 11:22.048
Happy birthday!

11:22.114 --> 11:23.883
Happy birthday, Holly.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.252
Happy 21st birthday.

11:26.318 --> 11:29.989
It's my birthday
and it's my biggest birthday yet.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.459
I'm finally turning 21.
I'm fucking buzzing.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.495
How do you feel?
Old.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.232
Sophie's not in her bed,
what the fuck?

11:42.735 --> 11:43.903
Holly.

11:43.969 --> 11:48.941
We find a note to Holly.
Read it out!

11:49.008 --> 11:51.343
This means one thing, Sophie's gone.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.947
"Hi, big tits, so sorry
I'm not here on your birthday.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.683
I've had to leave
to sort something out.

11:57.750 --> 12:01.520
I don't know when I'll be back.
I'm gutted I'll miss your big day.

12:01.587 --> 12:05.224
Look after Marnie. Don't all finger
each other whilst I'm gone."

12:05.291 --> 12:08.961
I can't believe she's actually left
and she's on my birthday,

12:09.028 --> 12:11.097
which means something
is seriously wrong

12:11.163 --> 12:14.166
because I know how excited
she was for it.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.970
Better not wake up tomorrow
and one of you is randomly gone.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.806
Holly hasn't had a good start
to her birthday

12:20.873 --> 12:25.010
but we need to pick up the spirits
cos it is her birthday.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.979
Sophie would have wanted this.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.483
Everyone got you some flowers
as well Holly.

12:30.549 --> 12:35.054
Ahhh. (laughs)
I've never had flowers before.

12:35.121 --> 12:39.024
What do I do with them?
Put them in water.

12:39.091 --> 12:44.330
They've bought me flowers but they're
obviously from a fucking garage.

12:45.364 --> 12:49.101
After last night
I do really like Scott

12:49.168 --> 12:51.604
and we've kissed
in front of the house.

12:51.670 --> 12:55.141
I'm excited. I just hope it all
doesn't go tits up.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.376
Where the fuck's Sophie
this morning?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.578
Fuck knows.
She's already gone.

12:59.645 --> 13:02.014
She's gone?
She left a note.

13:02.081 --> 13:06.252
She left a note saying she doesn't
know if she's gonna be back.

13:06.318 --> 13:10.055
When we first came in,
there was 5 girls and three boys.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.159
Now there's three of each.
Girls are dropping like flies.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.361
(doorbell rings)

13:19.165 --> 13:21.200
Morning everyone.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.736
Anna better have
good news on me birthday.

13:23.802 --> 13:28.507
As you all know Vicky left
the other night and sadly,

13:28.574 --> 13:30.509
she won't be coming back

13:30.576 --> 13:34.747
I can't believe Vicky isn't coming
back. I'm absolutely gutted.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.082
Sophie's not sure
when she'll be back.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.652
She hasn't got any fucking good news.

13:39.718 --> 13:42.087
She's telling me
Vicky's not coming back

13:42.154 --> 13:46.358
and doesn't know if Sophie's coming
back. Thanks, what a birthday spoiler

13:46.425 --> 13:51.397
Enough of the bad news as it is such
a very, very, very special birthday,

13:51.463 --> 13:55.601
I've decided you can have a house
party tonight. (cheering) Yes!

13:55.668 --> 14:00.539
Anna, you've redeemed yourself,
I'm having a party, fucking buzzing.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.508
Get prepared for your party, Holly.

14:02.575 --> 14:06.412
Tonight will not be the same
without Vicky and Sophie.

14:06.478 --> 14:11.083
Vicky's always the one getting the
champagne and sorting everyone out,

14:11.150 --> 14:13.185
Sophie's always sucking off the DJ.

14:17.256 --> 14:20.492
What you doing?
(sighs) Nowt.

14:20.559 --> 14:25.764
I want Kate to come to the party
but I'm gonna have to ask Holly.

14:25.831 --> 14:29.868
I just hope she's over all the past
and lets her come.

14:29.935 --> 14:35.307
I was going to invite all me mates
and Kate, I haven't seen her in ages

14:35.374 --> 14:40.246
No, James I do not want your
girlfriend at my 21st birthday party,

14:40.312 --> 14:42.214
why the fuck would I?

14:42.281 --> 14:46.518
She hates me and if she walks in,
I'm not going to not say anything.

14:46.585 --> 14:49.054
One look off her
and I'll say something.

14:49.121 --> 14:53.726
I've been with Kate ages. Don't know
why Holly's holding this grudge.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.930
The only thing I can think is she's
still arsed that I chose Kate.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.698
I'm just warning you, James.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.134
To be honest, fuck it then.

15:02.201 --> 15:06.505
I thought now you're 21 you'd be
fucking grown up a bit more.

15:06.572 --> 15:11.076
Shut the fuck up. If she comes,
don't expect it to be fucking rosy.

15:11.143 --> 15:14.580
Fucking, do you know what?
That's all I'm gonna fucking say.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.583
I've move on,
it's about time she did.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.917
Idiot.
Wow

15:20.986 --> 15:23.689
Right, we're going shopping.
See you later, lads.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.530
I can't wait to get some crazy
fancy dress shit.

15:42.608 --> 15:47.279
Yes, I was born in the '90s
and I was raving in the womb

15:47.346 --> 15:52.051
using my umbilical cord
as a glow stick. Bring it on.

15:54.720 --> 15:59.525
So we're just wondering if you've got
anything that's like, '90s. Rave.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.695
Rave stuff, there's loads
of neon stuff there. Whoo!

16:05.998 --> 16:07.800
Sweat bands!

16:07.866 --> 16:10.269
Whoo! Yes!

16:10.336 --> 16:13.405
I love fancy dress shops,
dressing up like a slag

16:13.472 --> 16:17.376
in crazy different outfits
is the best thing ever. I love it.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.747
I feel like the only thing
that could spoil this

16:21.814 --> 16:24.383
is the fact that Kate might turn up.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.252
Holly is completely right
about the Kate thing.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.723
If I was in Holly's situation
I'd be so pissed off.

16:30.789 --> 16:34.293
So if Kate comes tonight,
it's operation ignorance.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.197
One look at me and I'll be over
there like a fucking flash.

16:38.263 --> 16:41.700
We don't like each other.
James, get it in your head.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.736
We're not friends, never will be.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.306
It's my 21st. Happy birthday.
Thank you.

16:47.373 --> 16:51.076
Bye. Nice to meet you. Take care.
See ya.

16:54.246 --> 16:56.648
So, who have you got coming then?

16:56.715 --> 16:59.418
I've got some girls coming.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.620
Do you regret it a lot?
Yeah.

17:01.687 --> 17:07.126
I really do cos I'm panicking in
case Scott pulls one of them. Yeah.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.762
I just look like I've been
dragged through a hedge bush.

17:11.763 --> 17:15.666
(gasps) That is so '90s
Yeah, it is.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.244
Me and Scott are getting ready

17:26.310 --> 17:30.015
but I don't know if he's gonna
wingman us or bottle it.

17:33.519 --> 17:37.823
Scott hasn't got it in him to bang
a bird he's sacred of confrontation

17:37.890 --> 17:39.525
and Marnie kicking off.

17:42.428 --> 17:46.598
Gaz doesn't need to worry, he needs
wash the Chlamydia off his cock

17:46.665 --> 17:48.600
and letting me crack on tonight.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.809
On your 21st,
you've got to get a shag.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.612
I don't really know if I'm gonna
get over me cock fright.

18:00.679 --> 18:05.184
I don't know who this man will be.
I can teach you if you want,

18:05.250 --> 18:08.987
how to be sexy and get the boys,
do the fanny dance.

18:09.054 --> 18:13.625
She's showing me the fanny dance, it
is fucking shit. I won't be using it.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.696
If you get wider it lets out more.

18:17.763 --> 18:22.668
But I'm being very polite about it.
That's how you'll get them. OK.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.604
I'm telling you,
she'll be over that cock fright.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.739
Thanks for that information.

18:27.806 --> 18:30.108
All set like?
Aye.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.811
Are you buzzing?
Aye.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.248
So basically I've got three options.

18:36.315 --> 18:40.486
Bring Kate, don't invite her
or fuck off and go see her myself.

18:40.552 --> 18:43.889
I know what I'm fancying
after how Holly went on.

18:47.493 --> 18:50.696
I feel sorry for James
cos either way he loses out.

18:50.762 --> 18:55.968
If he brings Kate, Holly will kick
off or he won't get to see his bird.

18:56.034 --> 18:59.605
It's so awkward. Back to square one
where it's awkward again.

18:59.671 --> 19:05.310
It's a decision I have to make. I
hope I make the right one. (sighs)

19:06.311 --> 19:08.347
Happy fucking birthday.
(cheering)

19:08.413 --> 19:11.750
I'm having the best birthday ever.
(laughs)

19:13.252 --> 19:15.921
This Cuban boy is Scott's friend.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.358
Scott is having the house party
from hell. Marnie!

19:19.424 --> 19:20.759
Shit.

19:20.826 --> 19:26.331
Tonight might be the night I get over
this cock-fright. Hash tag squirter.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.800
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

19:28.867 --> 19:31.270
.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.807
.

19:47.786 --> 19:50.822
Fuck it,
after the way Holly's went on today,

19:50.889 --> 19:53.492
I'm off to see Kate instead.

19:56.295 --> 20:01.066
Somebody order some props
for a party? What the hell?

20:08.073 --> 20:09.441
Happy fucking birthday.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.778
I feel bad for Holly.
Her best friends aren't coming.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.681
Let's make it a night
she'll never forget.

20:31.229 --> 20:35.801
Marnie's asked me not to pull her
friends, I would've done that anyway

20:35.867 --> 20:38.904
She can do the same
and not pull my mates.

20:38.971 --> 20:43.642
We've made a pact. We've promised
not to get with each other's friends

20:43.709 --> 20:46.678
I really hope
that we both stick to it.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.380
Cheers!

20:48.447 --> 20:50.549
It's finally here, finally my party.

20:50.616 --> 20:54.086
Tonight might actually be the night
I get over this cock-fright.

20:59.992 --> 21:04.129
My mates turn up
and all of them look incredible.

21:04.196 --> 21:09.034
They're all fit and they all look
like there up for a laugh, game on.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.706
I didn't realise
all these people were coming.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.588
So Scott's friends have turned up,

21:29.655 --> 21:34.159
they're fit, but I'll and stay away
from them cos tonight I want Scott.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.427
What a buzz.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.280
Marnie's been cracking on with
everyone, it doesn't surprise us.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.223
For her 21st,
she needs a birthday shag.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.759
I don't know
who Holly's trying to kid.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.862
What she turned into,
some sort of crazy nun?

22:10.929 --> 22:14.132
Everyone knows
she's a massive slag.

22:14.199 --> 22:17.569
I used to be a slag,
I wish I could be again.

22:24.376 --> 22:29.448
So I'm sat with the boy I quite like
and everything's getting a bit flirty

22:32.951 --> 22:34.453
OK.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.888
This could be a really good night.

22:36.955 --> 22:38.957
(laughs)

22:46.231 --> 22:49.968
Me and Charlotte are having
a right laugh about Scott,

22:50.035 --> 22:55.207
he's trying to get me attention by
dancing. It's really embarrassing.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.881
Maybe he thought,
"Fuck it, I'm leaving."

23:06.118 --> 23:10.856
This party beats all other parties
I've been to. I love a swinging cock.

23:13.558 --> 23:17.562
So I'm in the sitting room
with this boy called Kieran.

23:17.629 --> 23:18.964
He's really good-looking

23:29.808 --> 23:32.577
The next thing I know
I'm kissing him.

23:32.644 --> 23:36.114
What the fuck? I've not
thought this through at all.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.386
Am I seeing things

23:41.453 --> 23:44.823
or is Marnie necking on with Kieran,
Scott's best friend?

23:44.890 --> 23:47.559
Eh?
She is literally playing with fire.

23:50.796 --> 23:51.797
Shit.

24:00.605 --> 24:05.043
I instantly regret it, it was on
impulse. I hope Scott didn't see.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.346
I know the others did.
I hope they don't tell him.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.988
Marnie kissed Scott's friend.

24:17.055 --> 24:20.759
This is the second one of Scott's
friends she's tried to pull.

24:20.826 --> 24:23.061
Who's next, Gary?

24:23.128 --> 24:26.531
I walk outside and not one person's
in the Jacuzzi.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.834
I'm gonna spice this party up.

24:32.838 --> 24:35.640
Marnie,
are you in with your clothes on?

24:38.677 --> 24:42.948
This is exactly what the house
needs, getting in the hot tub

24:43.014 --> 24:46.985
and necking on with me girlfriends.
Everyone else are just boring.

24:47.052 --> 24:50.288
(cheering)

24:50.355 --> 24:52.257
I was the group's lesbian.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.027
It's like she's doing it
for attention cos I know I do.

25:01.466 --> 25:04.569
I find out Marnie has pulled
one of me mates.

25:05.503 --> 25:07.839
So much for the fucking agreement.

25:11.042 --> 25:13.245
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:13.311 --> 25:14.813
Whoa, relax, relax.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.681
Scott's going absolutely mental

25:16.748 --> 25:19.017
cos I kissed one of his friends.

25:19.084 --> 25:22.420
it could've been anyone
and he still would've kicked off.

25:22.487 --> 25:26.491
Scott, do you wanna talk to us?
Get off, get off him, man.

25:28.994 --> 25:31.529
Fuck off! Fuck off!

25:33.732 --> 25:35.600
Scott's having the party from hell.

25:35.667 --> 25:39.571
Marnie's necked on with his
best friend, he's now legged it.

25:42.073 --> 25:45.744
I'm fucked off. I should've just
pied Marnie from the beginning

25:45.810 --> 25:49.080
and buried me nuts in
some bird's squirrel.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.750
Get in the house and don't kick off.

26:02.294 --> 26:05.297
Marnie's mates are soaking wet.

26:05.363 --> 26:09.501
Me being the caring lad I am,
gets them out of their wet clothes.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.170
A cheeky three-way kiss
never goes amiss.

26:16.474 --> 26:20.045
I'm with two girls in their underwear
having a three-way kiss,

26:20.111 --> 26:21.746
this house party is mint.

26:25.283 --> 26:27.719
For once,
I'm having a drama-free party.

26:27.786 --> 26:32.824
Fuck it I'm gonna get this girl, get
her upstairs, she's getting Gazzed.

26:36.428 --> 26:40.665
The drunker I get, the hornier I get,
the more game I get.

26:40.732 --> 26:43.068
The cock-fright
has just completely disappeared.

26:43.134 --> 26:46.171
I'm gonna take that cock
right to the shag pad.

26:46.237 --> 26:49.441
And yes I'm probably gonna
ride him all over.

26:56.681 --> 26:59.150
Buzzing, I'm over the cock-fright.

27:05.790 --> 27:09.961
So I go upstairs to find
me mate Kelly in bed with Gary.

27:12.397 --> 27:16.468
I decide to jump in with them
and start necking on with her,

27:16.534 --> 27:19.704
what the fuck am I doing?
I'm far too drunk.

27:22.841 --> 27:26.011
At one point I thought Marnie
was gonna join in,

27:26.077 --> 27:28.013
that would not go down well.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.748
I love you, bye.

27:29.814 --> 27:33.018
Another one of Marnie's mates
comes in and joins in.

27:33.084 --> 27:37.689
A threesome in a single bed. Where
there's a willy there's a way.

27:47.198 --> 27:50.568
I'm fucking mortal,
I can barley see.

27:50.635 --> 27:56.641
I'm in no fit state to talk, speak,
laugh, dance, or move with anyone.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.476
Ow!

28:02.614 --> 28:06.451
I can't be arsed with confrontation,
I'm gonna go to fucking bed.

28:06.518 --> 28:11.022
Tonight's made us realise
just how much Scott likes us.

28:11.089 --> 28:15.126
I thought he wasn't genuine and
I didn't know if I could trust him

28:15.193 --> 28:19.030
but after tonight's reaction,
it's made us like him a lot more.

28:21.266 --> 28:25.603
Marnie's worming her way into me bed
but she's getting the cold shoulder.

28:25.670 --> 28:28.673
She's playing games.
It's doing me fucking head in.

28:37.515 --> 28:41.286
This single bed is having my life.
I'm gonna find a double bed.

28:43.088 --> 28:44.089
What?

28:50.728 --> 28:53.865
It's a shag pad, not a cuddle pad.
Get out.

28:58.870 --> 29:04.109
I lost a girl but I've still got
a girl in the shag pad, round two.

29:10.115 --> 29:14.152
I thought the night couldn't get any
better, feel like I'm in Wet 'N Wild.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.957
Hash tag, squirter.

29:19.023 --> 29:22.293
Tonight's been one of the
best nights of my life.

29:22.360 --> 29:26.364
I'm gonna remember this forever.
I'm absolutely buzzing.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.968
I wish I could turn 21 every day.

29:32.403 --> 29:37.609
I am so drunk, so drunk, so drunk!
Now I'm pissing in the lads' bin.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.246
Cheers to pulling.

29:41.312 --> 29:44.082
I've decided to rip me top off.

29:44.149 --> 29:46.584
God help us.
The lad's absolutely mortal.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.855
I'm fucking pleased
I kissed his mate.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.126
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

29:55.193 --> 29:57.495
.

29:59.998 --> 30:02.000
.

30:19.050 --> 30:23.555
So I've woke up, I'm 21 and I'm back
to being a slag. Buzzing.

30:25.423 --> 30:29.027
Apparently Marnie kissed
one of Scott's friends.

30:30.828 --> 30:34.899
Marnie said that she would only pull
if Scott pulled

30:34.966 --> 30:38.603
but Scott didn't pull
and Marnie still pulled. Eh?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.506
Girls can never win at this game.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.776
It's so crap they can't.
I wish Sophie was here.

30:49.047 --> 30:53.251
I regret getting with Kieran.
I want to make things up with Scott.

30:53.318 --> 30:56.654
I need him to know
I didn't mean it at all.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.828
I'm arsed that he's me mate.
I didn't know that.

31:03.895 --> 31:08.600
You can't use that excuse on me. I
know all the tricks in the book.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.502
How would you feel
if I shagged your mate?

31:11.569 --> 31:16.140
You're just making us feel like a
piece of shit. Marnie's saying sorry

31:16.207 --> 31:20.144
I accept her apology but I don't
think I can trust her again.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.448
Are we friends? Yeah.
Can we go for a handshake?

31:25.216 --> 31:27.685
He's warmed to us a little bit,

31:27.752 --> 31:30.521
maybe we can pick up
where we left off.

31:34.492 --> 31:38.630
I'm so hungry,
so where best to go than I fry up?

31:40.565 --> 31:45.970
To deep throat some juicy sausages
and rub rashes of bacon on me clit.

32:03.888 --> 32:08.259
At breakfast, Vicky and Sophie
missing but where the fuck is James?

32:08.326 --> 32:12.063
I think it's a mystery mind,
like where is he now.

32:12.130 --> 32:17.168
I'm in game of Cluedo and I don't
know who's killing everyone off.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.772
He's the same prick he always was.
It was Holly

32:20.838 --> 32:23.608
in the shag pad with a dildo.

32:31.949 --> 32:36.654
I'm worried to see what everyone's
gonna be like when they get back

32:36.721 --> 32:41.092
but I think I did the right thing.
I was only gone for one night.

32:43.828 --> 32:47.498
Hey. Hi.
All right?

32:47.565 --> 32:50.735
James is back.
He's got some explaining to do

32:50.802 --> 32:53.805
for missing Holly's 21st birthday
last night.

32:53.871 --> 32:55.707
Why didn't you say bye?

32:55.773 --> 32:59.977
It just made it so awkward for us.
I was in an awkward position-

33:00.044 --> 33:02.347
You didn't tell us you were going.

33:02.413 --> 33:06.117
I was coming back today it's not
like I'm going away forever.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.220
I thought you wouldn't even notice,
it'd be fine.

33:09.287 --> 33:13.224
Holly had sex.
How many times are you gonna say it?

33:13.291 --> 33:16.928
I had the best 21st birthday party
anyone could've wished for.

33:16.994 --> 33:21.733
James not being there is probably
the reason why. I had a mint night.

33:21.799 --> 33:23.935
Wet 'N Wild!

33:24.001 --> 33:27.638
The weather is amazing. I'm gonna
get everyone out of the house,

33:27.705 --> 33:29.774
where better to go than Wet 'N Wild?

33:36.881 --> 33:41.786
I was at least expecting to see
some tits or mebbes some camel toes

33:41.853 --> 33:44.655
but all the lasses
have got T-shirts on.

33:46.591 --> 33:49.160
Things aren't OK
between me and Marnie.

33:49.227 --> 33:53.197
It's water under the bridge.
I can't be arsed to think about it.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.313
Fuck, I thought he'd forgotten.

34:16.687 --> 34:21.225
If Scott finds out about this on top
there'll be fucking hell to pay.

34:26.030 --> 34:29.367
If I put out with Scott
I'd be a slag.

34:29.434 --> 34:32.837
Now that I haven't I'm a cock tease.
Fuck off!

34:32.904 --> 34:34.871
Go, Gary!

34:47.717 --> 34:50.221
Me and Charlotte are stuck in a hoop,

34:50.288 --> 34:53.090
it looks like I'm trying
to bend her over.

34:53.157 --> 34:56.594
Me tits are too big and I can't
get out. Fucking nightmare.

34:59.397 --> 35:02.333
We're lodged in between her massive
breasts.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.370
She doesn't need inflatables,
she's got them two massive airbags.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.551
(phone rings)

35:22.053 --> 35:23.254
Hello.

35:26.724 --> 35:30.328
Me, Gaz and James are working
tonight on the limo bus,

35:30.394 --> 35:35.733
absolutely buzzing. I'm dying to see
some fresh mot. Marnie, jog on.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.268
Cheers to pulling.

35:37.335 --> 35:38.503
Fucking right.

35:38.569 --> 35:42.807
Loads of girls, loads of drink,
what could possible go wrong?

35:43.841 --> 35:46.410
Fuck this, the average age is 38.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.080
We've stopped off
at the retirement home.

35:49.146 --> 35:54.185
Let's go nuts. I'll still show the
Nanas a good time, just not me pipe.

35:58.589 --> 36:01.959
18 or 38 these MILFs
need to have a good time,

36:02.026 --> 36:03.828
we're gonna make sure that happens.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.231
(cheering)

36:15.306 --> 36:18.843
My aim in life
is to look like a doll.

36:18.910 --> 36:23.548
The lads have gone to work so we're
gonna go out, get fucking hammered.

36:23.614 --> 36:25.449
I feel pale.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.184
I'm in a kaftan.

36:27.251 --> 36:31.289
Charlotte and Holly come down
and they're dressed in these

36:31.355 --> 36:33.891
horrific floral kaftans.

36:33.958 --> 36:38.930
I feel a bit left out
but am I fuck wearing one of them?

36:41.165 --> 36:42.600
We have to get drunk.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.246
These MILFs have had an amazing time,

36:55.313 --> 36:59.083
now it's time for the after party
in Indigo, God help us.

37:03.454 --> 37:08.426
My job is to get the girls mortal
so they've got beer goggles on.

37:08.492 --> 37:12.697
so they fancy Scott and Gaz
and not just me. Come on.

37:12.763 --> 37:15.199
You'll challenge anything.

37:15.266 --> 37:19.070
# "Blurred Lines" - Robin Thicke

37:23.507 --> 37:27.011
It's getting proper hot
and I rip me top off.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.947
It's the most action
these Nanas are gonna get.

37:31.515 --> 37:36.454
Anna doesn't need to worry. No chance
of us are necking on with the MILFs.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.997
I hope none of these biddies
get a heart attack.

37:52.703 --> 37:55.706
Let's go to Bijoux
and see if Scott eventually pulls.

38:07.385 --> 38:11.422
So the lads come in from work
and they're absolutely mortal.

38:11.489 --> 38:15.793
(cheering)
I feel like I'm playing catch up.

38:26.203 --> 38:29.573
I'm looking at these skinny
beautiful girls with pert bums.

38:29.640 --> 38:34.145
I look down at meself and I'm like
some kind of multi-coloured unicorn.

38:34.211 --> 38:36.947
There's only one thing for this,
get mortal.

38:37.014 --> 38:39.784
Down it!
Swallow it, all of it!

38:49.026 --> 38:52.063
I can't be arsed with the dramas
with Marnie.

38:52.129 --> 38:55.833
I wanna pull with Gaz, get pissed
and have a laugh.

39:01.405 --> 39:05.643
So Scott decides to bring
loads of girls into our area.

39:05.710 --> 39:09.947
He's only doing it to piss us off.
But they are quite pretty

39:10.014 --> 39:11.949
so I do feel insecure.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.488
Scott's just trying
to make Marnie jealous,

39:17.555 --> 39:20.558
it's a stupid game
they've got caught up in.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.693
It used to happen to me with Gary.

39:35.005 --> 39:39.110
I'm necking on with one of these
birds, I'm thinking, "After party."

39:44.415 --> 39:48.753
Then I find out that they've all got
fucking boyfriends, what a liberty.

39:52.590 --> 39:56.360
If that was Scott's attempt
to try and get me back,

39:56.427 --> 40:00.498
it was absolutely pathetic. They've
pied him and he's failed miserably.

40:00.564 --> 40:04.401
Supposedly it's because they've got
boyfriends but if that had been Gary

40:04.468 --> 40:07.204
he would have
brought them back anyway.

40:12.643 --> 40:17.081
I'm looking over at Scott, at these
fucking ridiculous dance moves,

40:17.148 --> 40:21.685
it's off-putting, to be honest I'm
fucking pleased I kissed his mate.

40:25.322 --> 40:29.293
Scott's attempt to get payback
on Marnie has fell on its arse.

40:29.360 --> 40:33.931
He tried to pull, got pied off. Now
he's going home to crawl up her arse.

40:38.969 --> 40:42.406
You tried to pull on purpose
to annoy us, it didn't work.

40:42.473 --> 40:46.544
I'm so fucking angry. Scott needs
to know I felt like a mug.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.345
He can't treat us like that.

40:50.815 --> 40:52.216
Ah, right, OK.

41:10.534 --> 41:15.573
I am so drunk, I am so drunk,
so drunk, so drunk.

41:21.512 --> 41:24.348
So now I'm pissing in the lads' bin.

41:24.415 --> 41:27.818
What the fuck? This needs to stop.

41:27.885 --> 41:30.888
Someone help me, please.

41:36.794 --> 41:40.264
Tonight's been amazing but for
everyone else, on the other hand,

41:40.331 --> 41:43.567
I don't know. I don't even know
what they're called.

41:57.414 --> 42:01.151
I'm fucking sick of him. What he
did tonight was fucking deliberate.

42:04.288 --> 42:08.492
Is she for fucking real? After last
night there's no way I'm apologising

42:16.834 --> 42:18.802
Scott has this special power,

42:18.869 --> 42:22.840
he can piss people off
and get round them straight away

42:22.907 --> 42:24.808
by putting on that baby voice.

42:27.878 --> 42:31.482
I'm gonna neck on
and I'll talk about it another time.

42:55.572 --> 42:59.009
Me, Marnie, drink, work,
is not a good idea.

42:59.076 --> 43:02.613
She's a massive slag. I can't take
any more, my eyes are burning.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.949
Fucking idiot!

43:05.015 --> 43:08.886
I'm fucking snapped, I've had
enough. Don't touch us!

43:08.953 --> 43:12.189
Everyone's fucking kicking off.
She goes or I fucking go.

43:12.256 --> 43:16.226
I ain't coming back. She's just came
in and fucking ruined it all.

43:16.293 --> 43:17.928
Everything has changed.

43:17.995 --> 43:22.132
Where's your balls, Gary? Wanker. We
need to hope I don't knock him out.
