06:48.649 --> 06:52.085
Just so you know,
it wasn't an act or anything.

06:52.153 --> 06:55.213

48:33.322 --> 48:34.721
What'd they say?

48:34.790 --> 48:37.816
They said people
who drink coffee don't like rap.

48:37.893 --> 48:41.090
- That's ridiculous.
- That's what I said.

48:41.163 --> 48:44.462
So, uh, if I get somethin' to you,

48:44.533 --> 48:47.400
you give it a listen,
uh, see what you can do with it?

48:47.469 --> 48:49.993
- Yeah. Sure.
- Huh.

48:54.509 --> 48:55.601
[LaRoche] Hey.

48:57.512 --> 48:58.911
Charlie.

49:06.354 --> 49:10.153
Man, you look like shit.

49:12.125 --> 49:14.150
Nice briefcase, though.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.067
Well...

49:35.447 --> 49:36.914
Thanks, Charlie.

49:36.982 --> 49:38.449
[Grunts]

49:38.517 --> 49:41.418
That's for canceling your credit cards.

49:43.289 --> 49:46.486
- It is a nice briefcase.
- It is a nice briefcase.

49:46.559 --> 49:48.753
Keep your head up, homey. [laughs]

50:19.089 --> 50:21.455
I don't often go Into the clty.

50:21.525 --> 50:23.220
But when I do,

50:23.293 --> 50:27.388
I flnd comfort
In the knowledge that my

Shlt.

50:37.173 --> 50:39.198
I... I... What's...

50:39.275 --> 50:42.540
Susan Davis calls this
retro avant-garde.

50:42.612 --> 50:44.943
I think it's more retro avant-crap.

50:45.780 --> 50:47.873
Eliot, I'm in trouble.

50:47.949 --> 50:50.076
What kind of trouble?

50:50.151 --> 50:52.585
I cheated on Deanna.

50:53.288 --> 50:55.347
- You never cheated before?
- No.

50:55.423 --> 50:58.290
Everybody cheats.
You know what? Everybody gets over it.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.885
- No, this is different.
- Everybody says that too.

51:00.962 --> 51:03.624
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.
- There's this man...

51:03.698 --> 51:05.756
I don't want to know who it was with.

51:05.833 --> 51:09.064
Look, buy Deanna some flowers.
Talk it over with her.

51:09.136 --> 51:11.127
Try not to get caught next time.

51:11.205 --> 51:14.265
Now, for God's sake,
will you help me fix this piece of crap?

51:14.341 --> 51:16.332
[Tape rewlnds]

51:22.049 --> 51:25.211
- [Woman 1] You think I should?
- [Woman 2] Yeah.

51:27.620 --> 51:29.645
[Winston whistles] Chaz.

51:30.423 --> 51:32.789
- What up, yo?
- Hey.

51:32.859 --> 51:34.349
Ah, man, welcome back.

51:34.427 --> 51:35.519
How long has it been?

51:35.595 --> 51:37.358
High school.

51:37.430 --> 51:38.761
High school.

51:38.831 --> 51:41.356
Man, the best three years
of my life, man.

51:41.434 --> 51:43.560
All the pussy you could imagine,

51:43.635 --> 51:45.364
4.0 GPA,

51:45.437 --> 51:47.962
everything good
till they locked my ass away.

51:48.040 --> 51:49.905
What were you in for?

51:49.975 --> 51:53.604
Me? I was what they call
a recreational drug user.

51:54.680 --> 51:55.669
And that's it?

51:55.747 --> 51:58.944
I was also
a recreational drug distributor.

51:59.017 --> 52:02.645
You know, a little H, some dope, digi.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.415
So how was it?

52:04.488 --> 52:06.251
Man, nothin' but the best.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.225
I sold a pure commodity
at a fair market price.

52:09.293 --> 52:10.783
No. Prison.

52:13.531 --> 52:15.999
Prison's like walkin' a tightrope.

52:16.067 --> 52:17.898
You try not to get involved.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.630
Actin' like you're blind 24 hours a day.

52:20.705 --> 52:23.901
This shit takes
a shitload of concentration.

52:23.973 --> 52:27.807
I mean, when I first got in thatjoint,
man, I was prime meat.

52:27.877 --> 52:30.539
I was what they call unaffiliated.

52:30.613 --> 52:32.012
So, what'd you do?

52:32.082 --> 52:35.176
[Scoffs] I got affiliated.

52:35.251 --> 52:38.914
I had to stick a shank up in some kid.

52:38.988 --> 52:41.717
- What, you killed him?
- [Elevator dings]

52:41.790 --> 52:44.020
Your back is up against the wall,

52:44.093 --> 52:46.459
and it's you or him,

52:46.528 --> 52:48.621

[Cell phone rlngs]

53:08.950 --> 53:10.781

53:10.852 --> 53:14.253
[LaRoche] You ever get

53:14.322 --> 53:16.381
I need another loan, Charlle.

53:16.457 --> 53:19.755
Now listen. Listen to me.

53:19.826 --> 53:22.124

53:22.195 --> 53:24.322
OK. OK, man. You wln.

53:24.398 --> 53:26.832

53:26.900 --> 53:28.561
I'll leave you alone.

53:28.635 --> 53:31.069
No problemo.

53:31.138 --> 53:34.266
For $100,000, though.

Hey! Here's my man.

54:46.576 --> 54:48.635
You OK? You look
like you ran a marathon.

54:48.711 --> 54:49.700
What?

54:50.513 --> 54:52.413
What did you say
to him on the phone?

54:52.482 --> 54:56.247
Well, in our business one has to know
how to light a fire under people.

54:56.318 --> 54:59.515
It's the best way to get things done.
Do you not agree, Charles?

54:59.588 --> 55:01.852
- What's going on here?
- Mr. LaRoche needs you

55:01.923 --> 55:04.153
to sign off on that thing
he called about.

55:05.527 --> 55:07.290
Oh, gosh.

55:07.362 --> 55:11.059
- Did you think I would not come?
- No, I thought you got the message.

55:12.534 --> 55:14.627
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

55:14.703 --> 55:17.637
But you look so out of shape, Charles.

55:17.705 --> 55:19.730
Sit down and catch
your breath for a second.

55:19.807 --> 55:22.833
- [Deanna] I'll pour coffee.
- You don't know how many times

55:22.910 --> 55:24.810
- I told him to join my tennis club.
- What?

55:24.879 --> 55:28.406
You know Charles. He prefers
to follow sports, not play them.

55:28.482 --> 55:30.643
But one has
to keep fit in today's world

55:30.718 --> 55:33.983
'cause you never know when you'll
need to be at your fighting best.

55:34.054 --> 55:35.987
Please.

55:36.055 --> 55:38.785
He's right. You might have
been able to outrun that mugger.

55:38.858 --> 55:41.691
Oh. Well, from what Charles told me,

55:41.761 --> 55:44.821
that thug had a jump on him
from the very start.

55:44.898 --> 55:47.492
This is crazy.
You never had a chance, did you?

55:47.567 --> 55:48.727
I'm gonna get him back.

55:48.801 --> 55:51.861
You're not getting anyone back.
You have a family.

55:51.938 --> 55:53.667
You're so right, Deanna, so right.

55:53.740 --> 55:57.368
You wanna protect your family
'cause at the end of the day,

55:57.442 --> 56:00.036
this is the most important thing
in the whole world.

56:01.813 --> 56:04.509
- Mom, have you seen my sketchbook?
- Get back upstairs.

56:04.583 --> 56:06.244
- Go do your homework.
- Charles.

56:06.318 --> 56:09.583
Amy, this is Mr. LaRoche.
He works with your father.

56:10.222 --> 56:13.622
Come here, beauty. [laughs]

56:13.691 --> 56:15.386

56:19.864 --> 56:23.891
It means, "like a little stone
that's rolling down the river."

56:23.968 --> 56:25.629
So cute.

56:25.703 --> 56:27.796
- May I kiss you?
- Mm-hm.

56:29.340 --> 56:31.740
You know,
we were looking at your drawings.

56:31.809 --> 56:33.708
They're lovely. Truly beautiful.

56:33.777 --> 56:35.438
Thank you.

56:35.512 --> 56:37.275
Such a talent.

56:37.347 --> 56:40.009
You know, when I first came
to this beautiful country,

56:40.083 --> 56:42.916
I spent quite a lot
of time in New York.

56:42.986 --> 56:44.613
And if you allow me, of course,

56:44.688 --> 56:47.851
I could show these
to some very prominent art dealers.

56:47.924 --> 56:49.152
That sounds great.

56:49.225 --> 56:51.216
How about we go sign off
on this contract?

56:51.294 --> 56:53.591
Oh, yes, business is business,
of course.

56:53.662 --> 56:55.027
- Bye-bye.
- [Amy] Bye.

56:56.198 --> 56:58.632
- Whoop!
- [Amy laughing]

57:00.035 --> 57:01.434
She's so cute.

57:01.503 --> 57:02.765
I'll be up soon, honey.

57:02.838 --> 57:04.533
How old is she?

57:06.942 --> 57:10.343
- You get the fuck out of my house.
- What did you say?

57:10.412 --> 57:12.936
- Get out.
- I beg your pardon.

57:15.149 --> 57:16.343
What'd you say?

57:16.417 --> 57:18.817
- [Groaning]
- Ooh.

57:18.886 --> 57:20.945
You don't like that, huh?

57:22.323 --> 57:26.123
You upper-crust motherfucker. Huh?

57:27.028 --> 57:31.191
You got it all, and yet you're ready
to fuck it up forjust a bit of pussy?

57:31.264 --> 57:32.731
- Fuck...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

57:34.203 --> 57:35.534
A hundred...

57:35.604 --> 57:38.072
A hundred thousand dollars,

57:38.140 --> 57:41.632
and I just might
give you back your balls, bitch.

57:41.710 --> 57:43.109
You hear me?

57:43.178 --> 57:45.840
Say it. OK? OK?

57:45.914 --> 57:48.075
Yeah, nice boy.

57:50.051 --> 57:53.020
OK... OK.

57:53.087 --> 57:56.853
Well... au revolr. Thanks for having me.

57:56.924 --> 58:00.360
- Au revolr.
- I'll see you soon. Bye.

58:00.428 --> 58:02.555
[Door opens, closes]

58:02.630 --> 58:04.188
He seems like a lovely guy.

58:05.266 --> 58:06.334
[Jerry] Why didn't you call me
when this whole thing began?

58:06.334 --> 58:07.995
[Jerry] Why didn't you call me
when this whole thing began?

58:08.069 --> 58:10.229
I'm supposed
to be your first call, Charles.

58:10.303 --> 58:12.567
I don't need a lecture,
I need to know my options.

58:12.639 --> 58:14.266
Look, she's gotta come forward.

58:14.341 --> 58:15.968
I told you, she can't do that.

58:16.043 --> 58:19.342
- We need a statement on the record.
- Jerry, he was in my house.

58:19.413 --> 58:20.903
With my family.

58:20.981 --> 58:22.949
He didn't break in.
He didn't touch them.

58:23.016 --> 58:25.883
- He didn't threaten them.
- Jerry. He broke my nose.

58:25.952 --> 58:27.510
OK, show me the police report.

58:27.587 --> 58:30.020
Did you go to the police
when you got beat?

58:30.890 --> 58:32.551
So...

58:32.625 --> 58:35.116
So you've done nothing
about this for six weeks,

58:35.194 --> 58:37.526
and now suddenly you want me
to file a complaint?

58:37.596 --> 58:39.564
You've got to get her to come forward.

58:39.632 --> 58:42.863
Anything else is just...
pissing in the wind.

58:42.935 --> 58:45.267
- What are you doing here?
- I spoke to my lawyer.

58:45.337 --> 58:48.100
- We have to go to the police.
- We can't go to the police.

58:48.173 --> 58:49.401
Listen to me.

58:49.474 --> 58:52.466
- We didn't sleep together.
- It's the same thing.

58:52.544 --> 58:55.479
Because we didn't fuck
doesn't mean we didn't cross the line.

58:55.547 --> 58:57.515
We went to the hotel.
We started to do it.

58:57.582 --> 59:00.517
And we didn't stop
out of the conscience of our hearts.

59:00.585 --> 59:02.416
Exactly. We were attacked.

59:08.325 --> 59:09.792
I had an abortion, Charles.

59:10.360 --> 59:11.418
What?

59:14.998 --> 59:16.829
Why didn't you tell me?

59:19.403 --> 59:22.031
I... I could have helped.
I could have done something.

59:22.106 --> 59:24.074
Done what, Charles?

59:25.142 --> 59:27.735
What could you have done?

59:31.814 --> 59:33.907
Oh! Snap his back, man!

59:33.983 --> 59:36.247
Smack him!
Referee, that's a penalty!

59:38.354 --> 59:41.846
Sorry, you know I get zoned
to this hockey shit, Chaz, man.

59:41.924 --> 59:43.482
OK, I'm listening.

59:43.559 --> 59:45.720
So, what do you think I should do?

59:45.795 --> 59:49.025
Shit, I don't know, man.
But you see how it works, though, right?

59:49.097 --> 59:53.557
He lures you in with 20 grand. Folks
like you could pull together 20 grand

59:53.635 --> 59:54.966
if you had to, right?

59:55.036 --> 59:58.267
You think, 20 grand,
bong, and he's gone, right?

59:58.340 --> 1:00:00.399
Nah. It's not about that.

1:00:00.475 --> 1:00:02.909
He wanna see if you're
the kind of asshole who pays.

1:00:02.978 --> 1:00:05.241
Then after that...
[imitates whip cracking]

1:00:05.312 --> 1:00:09.043
...slap the big dick on you, hit you
for the real cheese, the big bucks.

1:00:09.116 --> 1:00:11.311
That's what this game
is all about, Chaz.

1:00:11.385 --> 1:00:13.285
Thanks, Winston,
I feel much better now.

1:00:13.354 --> 1:00:15.720
You're a wild cowboy, yo.

1:00:17.892 --> 1:00:19.519
Well, can you pay him?

1:00:20.194 --> 1:00:22.526
Technically, yeah, I have the money.

1:00:22.596 --> 1:00:24.859
Shit, yo, so pay him,
man, be done with this.

1:00:24.931 --> 1:00:27.024
I can't. It's put away
for something else.

1:00:27.100 --> 1:00:29.125
It's years of savings. Can't touch it.

1:00:29.202 --> 1:00:32.103
I don't know what to do.
I'm going out of my fuckin' mind here.

1:00:32.172 --> 1:00:34.800
- It's there everywhere I turn.
- Calm down, Chaz.

1:00:34.874 --> 1:00:36.808
Look, man, drink your beer.

1:00:38.278 --> 1:00:40.712
Shit, that ain't even
strong enough right now.

1:00:40.780 --> 1:00:43.839
O'Malley, let us get
a double Scotch and hold the rocks.

1:00:45.450 --> 1:00:46.747
Let me tell you something.

1:00:46.819 --> 1:00:50.186
I spent five years in the joint
with motherfuckers like this.

1:00:50.255 --> 1:00:53.850
The first thing you must understand
about a rapist is that they pussies.

1:00:53.926 --> 1:00:55.791
They weak. They prey on the weak.

1:00:55.861 --> 1:00:57.488
So, what do you think I should do?

1:00:57.563 --> 1:01:01.556
[Exhales] Listen, man, I like you,

1:01:01.633 --> 1:01:03.896
'cause you're different
than the rest of them.

1:01:03.968 --> 1:01:06.368
I don't like to see you
in no position like this.

1:01:06.437 --> 1:01:07.904
So I'm gonna do you a solid.

1:01:07.972 --> 1:01:10.440
I'm gonna scare this pussy
off your back for you.

1:01:10.508 --> 1:01:13.033
- No. No, no, no.
- Listen, I owe you.

1:01:13.110 --> 1:01:15.271
You caught me stealin' those computers,

1:01:15.346 --> 1:01:16.813
you coulda dropped a dime on me,

1:01:16.881 --> 1:01:19.008
I'd have been locked up
for three more years.

1:01:19.083 --> 1:01:22.483
- Winston, you owe me nothing.
- Look at it this way then.

1:01:22.552 --> 1:01:24.349
Let's make it a business proposition.

1:01:24.421 --> 1:01:26.889
Instead of you giving
this motherfucker 100K,

1:01:26.957 --> 1:01:29.755
you could pay me, say, ten percent?

1:01:29.826 --> 1:01:32.420
Yeah, $10,000 in cash,

1:01:32.495 --> 1:01:36.022

motherfucker all the way back to France.

1:01:40.170 --> 1:01:42.569

1:01:54.483 --> 1:01:56.178
Yeah.

1:01:56.252 --> 1:01:58.482

1:02:57.209 --> 1:02:58.801

1:02:58.878 --> 1:03:01.573
I need a cash check

1:03:01.646 --> 1:03:02.840

1:03:25.202 --> 1:03:27.329
Oh, let me tell you

1:03:27.404 --> 1:03:32.637
- Frederick Price and Creflo Dollar.
- Yes, Winston, I have your money.

1:03:32.710 --> 1:03:34.701
Who's talkin' money here, Chaz?

1:03:34.778 --> 1:03:36.803
Just tryin' to make conversation, man.

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:39.211

1:04:13.515 --> 1:04:14.982
You're gonna shoot him?

1:04:15.050 --> 1:04:18.382
I ain't gonna shoot him. I'm gonna
scare his monkey-ass off your back.

1:04:18.452 --> 1:04:19.942
It's not even loaded.

1:04:20.021 --> 1:04:23.047
But it's like
an old gangsta proverb, yo.

1:04:23.124 --> 1:04:26.582
You ain't gotta use force,
but you gotta project strength.

1:04:26.660 --> 1:04:29.254
Project strength. Right.

1:04:29.330 --> 1:04:32.390
- Got it.
- Chaz, my good buddy,

1:04:32.466 --> 1:04:35.560

Come on, take that.

1:04:36.669 --> 1:04:38.102

When you feel comfortable,
you come on in.

We got maybe a hour
before this bastard shows up.

1:04:49.382 --> 1:04:51.282
You're gonna be close, though, right?

1:04:51.351 --> 1:04:53.751
I'm gonna be close.
Don't worry. I got your back.

the bad guy
is always one step ahead, right?

1:04:58.057 --> 1:05:01.424

you fuckin' piece of shit,

for our relationship.

Maybe he wants a date.

1:06:03.652 --> 1:06:05.586
I don't think so.

1:06:06.422 --> 1:06:09.414

1:14:10.547 --> 1:14:14.074
Dex. You think I should count this,
or... just trust him?

1:14:14.151 --> 1:14:16.209
Sure. Why not?

1:15:21.914 --> 1:15:24.144
I don't even...

1:15:24.217 --> 1:15:25.775
They must have just followed me.

I didn't even... I don't know...
They just... pushed their way in.

1:15:29.222 --> 1:15:30.655
It's OK now.

1:15:35.961 --> 1:15:39.522
- Are you sure that they're gone?
- He's gone.

1:15:39.598 --> 1:15:40.826
I paid him.

I paid him everything.

[Chuckles]

1:17:21.795 --> 1:17:23.922
You're a hard man to track down.

1:17:25.332 --> 1:17:28.529
You're not at work,
you're not at home...

1:17:30.169 --> 1:17:33.400
This is where all you bored executive

1:17:35.674 --> 1:17:37.608
[Chuckles] I'm sure.

1:17:37.676 --> 1:17:39.610
You know, ever since he was a kid,

1:17:39.678 --> 1:17:41.737
Winston never could
seem to catch a break.

1:17:41.814 --> 1:17:43.679
You know who
he always reminded me of?

1:17:43.749 --> 1:17:46.013
Bobby Bonds.

1:17:46.085 --> 1:17:48.848
Unluckiest player
to ever step up to the plate.

1:17:48.920 --> 1:17:52.686
Bobby Bonds struck out
187 times in 1969,

1:17:52.757 --> 1:17:55.555
more than any other player
in a single season,

1:17:55.627 --> 1:17:58.221
except one.

1:17:58.296 --> 1:17:59.661
You know who?

This is my new buddy.
Sean owns this place.

1:18:15.045 --> 1:18:18.276
- Hey, Sean, Scotch. Drop the rocks.
- [Sean] Comin' up, Frank.

1:18:18.348 --> 1:18:21.112
Sean says you and Winston
had a drink here recently.

1:18:21.185 --> 1:18:23.380
Mind telling me
what you were talkin' about?

1:18:24.454 --> 1:18:27.684
- Hockey.
- Hockey. That's it?

1:18:27.757 --> 1:18:29.554
There was a game on.

1:18:29.625 --> 1:18:32.594
Now, I still need to know
where you were last night.

1:18:32.662 --> 1:18:34.630
I told ya. I was workin'.

1:18:34.697 --> 1:18:37.860
- No one at your office can confirm.
- I was alone.

1:18:39.402 --> 1:18:40.733
OK, Mr. Schine.

1:18:41.404 --> 1:18:44.805
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
talking to me with your lawyer.

1:18:44.874 --> 1:18:47.808
Why don't the two of you
come by my office tomorrow morning?

1:18:47.876 --> 1:18:49.343
And just so you know,

1:18:50.745 --> 1:18:54.772
I'm gonna crucify
the son of a bitch who killed Winston.

I've made a horrible mistake, Dee.

1:19:49.902 --> 1:19:52.769
The money we put away for Amy...

1:19:56.108 --> 1:19:57.666
...it's gone.

1:19:59.044 --> 1:20:02.013
- Gone?
- All of it.

1:20:04.515 --> 1:20:07.575
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, where is it? Where is the money?

1:20:07.652 --> 1:20:10.587
- I'll figure it out.
- Figure out what? What's going on?

1:20:10.655 --> 1:20:13.180
- I'll find a way.
- What have you done?

1:20:14.258 --> 1:20:16.453
Tell me what you've done.

- You fucking explain yourself!
- I'll tell you, Dee.

1:20:28.838 --> 1:20:30.806

would it?

Why would he rape her?

...that you didn't protect her.

1:29:46.033 --> 1:29:49.560
Later on, she may even be as sick
as to tell you she had an abortion.

1:29:49.636 --> 1:29:52.434
- So you don't go to the police.
- I don't want any part of this.

1:29:52.506 --> 1:29:54.633
- There's a man waiting.
- I have to leave...

1:29:54.708 --> 1:29:55.902
No!

1:29:57.678 --> 1:29:59.771
[LaRoche groaning]

1:30:01.949 --> 1:30:04.678
Boy, you're getting better, Charles.

1:30:09.856 --> 1:30:12.825
I'm kind of proud of you. [groans]

1:30:12.892 --> 1:30:16.521
I want... my fuckin' money back!

1:30:17.430 --> 1:30:19.193
I want everything you took from me.

1:30:23.568 --> 1:30:25.536
Well...

1:30:25.604 --> 1:30:28.004
I don't think that's
gonna be possible, Charlie.

1:30:28.073 --> 1:30:31.736
Just give him his money, and let's go.

1:30:31.810 --> 1:30:34.643
He's a fuckin' mark, for chrissake.

1:30:35.747 --> 1:30:38.511
That sweetie pie is worried
about that little girl of yours.

1:30:38.583 --> 1:30:41.518
- [Lucinda] Oh, stop it!
- She didn't look that sick to me.

1:30:41.585 --> 1:30:42.984
Just stop it!

1:30:44.889 --> 1:30:46.481
[Gun firing]

1:30:50.828 --> 1:30:53.524
[Man] Let me outta here!
I'm gonna get outta here now!

1:30:53.597 --> 1:30:56.327
I'm telling you,
move away from the fucking door!

1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:59.801
I'm gonna shoot!
Get outta my way! I'm leaving

1:31:00.504 --> 1:31:01.731
Ah!

1:31:05.975 --> 1:31:07.408
[Dexter] Frenchie!

1:31:08.611 --> 1:31:11.079
- [Dexter banging on door]
- [Whimpering]

1:31:18.254 --> 1:31:19.243
[Gun clicks]

1:31:21.857 --> 1:31:23.017
[Dexter] Ah!

1:31:27.262 --> 1:31:29.423
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

1:32:00.527 --> 1:32:02.392
[Lucinda gasping]

1:32:15.976 --> 1:32:18.409
[Sirens wailing in distance]

1:32:29.221 --> 1:32:31.212
[Man] Step by step,
what did you hear?

1:32:31.290 --> 1:32:35.090
Sir, there's no ID on the white male.
Prints people are on it.

1:32:35.160 --> 1:32:38.526
All right. See if he's on the register.
Check what's in the hotel safe.

1:32:38.596 --> 1:32:39.927
Yes, sir.

1:32:39.998 --> 1:32:41.795
Sorry about that. You were saying?

1:32:43.001 --> 1:32:44.332
I heard the shots,

1:32:44.402 --> 1:32:46.700
I saw the security guy run past,

1:32:46.771 --> 1:32:49.001
so I just... closed the door.

1:32:49.073 --> 1:32:50.438
You did the right thing.

1:32:50.508 --> 1:32:54.444
You don't know how may wannabe heroes
I ship off to the morgue each week.

1:32:54.512 --> 1:32:57.446
- OK, Mr... Sheen? Schine?
- Schine.

1:32:57.514 --> 1:32:58.606
Schine.

1:32:58.682 --> 1:33:02.379
All right, if we need anything more,
we'll contact you.

1:33:03.587 --> 1:33:04.952
[Elevator bell dings]

1:33:06.390 --> 1:33:08.551
[Church] Hey.
You seen Jones from Homicide?

1:33:08.625 --> 1:33:10.354
Yes, sir. Yes, the, uh...

1:33:12.062 --> 1:33:14.826
Vince, can we get the
happy snappers out of here today?

1:33:14.898 --> 1:33:17.297
I'm losin' the will to live.

1:33:18.968 --> 1:33:22.870
Frank. What are you doing here, Frank?

1:33:22.938 --> 1:33:24.565
- Where is it?
- I'll show you.

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:27.803
Heard you found a Smith & Wesson 5906.

1:33:27.877 --> 1:33:30.846
- Yeah, Ballistics has it.
- What a mess.

1:33:31.881 --> 1:33:33.712
Yeah, pretty straightforward.

1:33:33.783 --> 1:33:35.647
A woman and the suit
are having a thing.

1:33:35.717 --> 1:33:36.809
They get mugged,

1:33:36.885 --> 1:33:40.184
security tries to help them...
everybody gets shot.

1:33:40.255 --> 1:33:42.086
[Church] I'm interested in that gun,

1:33:42.157 --> 1:33:44.887
so please call me
when you get the ballistics report.

1:33:44.959 --> 1:33:46.483
Sure.

1:33:46.561 --> 1:33:49.325
- Thanks.
- OK, take care.

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:55.630
[Detective] Vince,
can we get everybody out of here?

1:33:55.703 --> 1:33:58.263
- [Officer] I need a statement.
- [Man] Gonna take long?

1:33:58.338 --> 1:34:00.772
- [Officer] Couple minutes.
- I don't got much time.

1:34:00.841 --> 1:34:02.138
[Officer 2] Keep it comin'.

1:34:02.209 --> 1:34:04.109
[Man] I was standing here.

1:34:06.313 --> 1:34:08.178
[Officer 2] You got a lot in that safe.

1:34:14.787 --> 1:34:16.778
I, uh...

1:34:16.856 --> 1:34:19.381
I believe that's mine.

1:34:27.867 --> 1:34:29.164
Nice briefcase.

1:34:29.235 --> 1:34:32.534
OK, what else you got?

1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:38.234
- [Sirens wailing]
- [Indistinct chatter]

1:34:42.614 --> 1:34:44.844
[Man] Back it up there, back it up.

1:35:07.571 --> 1:35:10.005
[Barry] No sign of it here, either.

1:35:10.074 --> 1:35:12.065
All right, thanks.

1:35:19.816 --> 1:35:22.546
What the hell is this?

1:35:23.753 --> 1:35:26.085
All the years I've known you,

1:35:27.056 --> 1:35:29.320
I never figured you
for a thief, Charles.

1:35:30.593 --> 1:35:34.585
You want to tell me
about the $10,000 for the aspirin spot?

1:35:34.663 --> 1:35:37.996
It was an emergency.
I was gonna pay it back.

1:35:38.066 --> 1:35:39.795
Pay it back?

1:35:39.868 --> 1:35:41.495
What am I, a bank?

1:35:41.570 --> 1:35:43.902
And now you're stealing from it.

1:35:43.972 --> 1:35:47.373
If I were to write a bill for what you
owe me, what should I make it for?

1:35:47.442 --> 1:35:49.000
It was just the once, I swear.

1:35:49.077 --> 1:35:51.806
Well, Barry'll be the judge of that.

1:35:51.879 --> 1:35:53.744
So...

1:35:53.815 --> 1:35:57.342
...tell me what was so important
that you had to do this.

1:35:57.418 --> 1:35:59.045
Can't.

1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:01.987
I can't tell you.

1:36:02.056 --> 1:36:04.616
I want to, but I can't. I'm sorry.

1:36:04.692 --> 1:36:08.651
Fine. You wanna play it that way,
I'll start proceedings.

1:36:09.730 --> 1:36:11.196
Proceedings?

1:36:11.264 --> 1:36:14.256
He suspends you
while we conduct an investigation.

1:36:16.236 --> 1:36:17.669
Just pay it back.

1:36:17.737 --> 1:36:20.672
The most you'll get
is community service.

1:36:23.643 --> 1:36:27.044
Keep stonewalling us, pal,
you go to jail.

1:36:42.995 --> 1:36:44.690
[Man] Hi there.

1:36:48.334 --> 1:36:51.598
- Heya, teach.
- Hank, isn't it?

1:36:51.669 --> 1:36:53.034
That's good.

1:36:53.104 --> 1:36:55.572
I hate it when people
don't remember your name.

1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:57.107
Go on through.

1:36:59.744 --> 1:37:03.805
- It's Charles, by the way.
- Right. Charles.

1:37:05.016 --> 1:37:08.507
- Did I ask you what you're in for yet?
- Embezzlement.

1:37:08.585 --> 1:37:09.984
That's not a bad deal.

1:37:10.053 --> 1:37:13.750
Six months teaching cons
for ripping off your boss.

1:37:13.824 --> 1:37:15.724
[Man] You're Puerto Rican, right?

1:37:15.792 --> 1:37:17.885
What the fuck is that?

1:37:17.961 --> 1:37:19.519
Puerto Rico, how do you spell it?

1:37:19.596 --> 1:37:21.860
OK, guys.

1:37:23.867 --> 1:37:25.334
- Guys!
- [Bangs on table]

1:37:26.770 --> 1:37:28.862
There's a quiz on your desks.

1:37:28.938 --> 1:37:32.499
It'll probably take you as long as it
takes me to read your homework, so...

1:37:34.010 --> 1:37:35.602
Let's go.

1:37:50.458 --> 1:37:51.891
[Man] How do you spell that?

1:37:59.434 --> 1:38:01.994
[Prisoners whispering]

1:38:08.676 --> 1:38:11.236
[Charles] "The mornlng It all began,

1:38:11.312 --> 1:38:13.542
began llke any other mornlng.

1:38:13.614 --> 1:38:16.105
Charles was runnlng late,

1:38:16.183 --> 1:38:19.152
and as a result,
he mlssed hls regular traln.

1:38:33.166 --> 1:38:35.634
I need a loan, Charlle.

1:38:38.004 --> 1:38:40.336
Charles had made hlm klll.

1:38:40.406 --> 1:38:42.897
Charles was to blame.

1:38:42.976 --> 1:38:45.466
He was a murder suspect.

1:38:45.544 --> 1:38:48.536
Luclnda turned out to be
thls whole other person.

1:38:48.613 --> 1:38:50.205
Charles wlped hls prlnts

1:38:50.282 --> 1:38:53.649

1:38:56.788 --> 1:38:59.313
But when he flnlshed readlng the story,

1:38:59.391 --> 1:39:02.087
he went to the laundry room."

1:39:26.649 --> 1:39:29.345
- Yeah?
- I need to use the bathroom.

1:39:29.419 --> 1:39:31.785
I'll alert the media.

1:39:51.774 --> 1:39:53.503
[Man speaks Spanish]

1:39:53.575 --> 1:39:55.907
You lookin' for a daddy?

1:40:04.285 --> 1:40:06.378
[Man 2] What the fuck
you lookin' at, homey?

1:40:06.454 --> 1:40:09.355
- [Man 3] Oooh...
- [whistling]

1:40:26.540 --> 1:40:29.065
[Clanging continues]

1:40:39.119 --> 1:40:40.677
[Clanging continues]

1:40:43.355 --> 1:40:46.324
- [LaRoche] I hope you liked my story.
- [Clattering]

1:40:48.427 --> 1:40:52.227
You never checked if I made it out
of that hotel alive, did you?

1:40:52.298 --> 1:40:55.790
[Chuckles] You're so
predictable, Charles.

1:40:55.868 --> 1:40:57.995
It takes more
than one bullet to kill me.

1:40:58.070 --> 1:41:00.401
Much more.

1:41:05.877 --> 1:41:08.971
But you took something from me, Charlie,

1:41:09.047 --> 1:41:10.981
and that ain't right.

1:41:13.585 --> 1:41:15.485
It's my money.

1:41:16.821 --> 1:41:18.721
Fuck the money.

1:41:18.790 --> 1:41:22.156
- You killed her.
- You're insane.

1:41:25.929 --> 1:41:28.329
I loved her, Charlie...

1:41:28.398 --> 1:41:30.662
...when you just wanted to fuck her.

1:41:32.236 --> 1:41:34.170
What do you want?

1:41:36.106 --> 1:41:37.937
I want you, Charlie.

1:41:45.348 --> 1:41:48.249
I'm gonna fuck
with your life because I can.

1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:52.446
By the way...

1:41:54.090 --> 1:41:57.150
...is your daughter still a virgin?
- [Grunting]

1:42:00.428 --> 1:42:04.330
You don't know how happy I was
to see your name on those notebooks.

1:42:04.399 --> 1:42:06.867
It's like if you begged me to find you.

1:42:06.935 --> 1:42:10.268
Man, you ended up
in the wrong prison, Charlie.

1:42:10.338 --> 1:42:11.828
- LaRoche.
- Yeah?

1:42:11.907 --> 1:42:13.932
I chose this prison.

1:42:16.311 --> 1:42:17.641
Oh!

1:42:57.082 --> 1:42:59.915
OK, Mr. Schine. You're free to go.

1:43:10.395 --> 1:43:11.953
You take it easy now.

1:43:22.106 --> 1:43:24.472
[Church] I met him
a few times a while ago.

1:43:24.542 --> 1:43:26.032
[Chattering]

1:43:26.110 --> 1:43:28.203
[Church] Here he comes.
All right, thank you.

1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:40.651
- What did you tell them?
- The truth.

1:43:40.724 --> 1:43:44.182
I went to use the bathroom,
and this guy jumped me with a shank.

1:43:45.462 --> 1:43:49.228
Well, that guy
was the asshole who killed Winston.

1:43:52.636 --> 1:43:55.627
He killed two people in Paris,

1:43:55.704 --> 1:43:57.865
one in New York.

1:43:57.940 --> 1:44:00.670
You expect me to believe
that you overpowered him?

1:44:01.310 --> 1:44:02.800
I guess I got lucky.

1:44:11.587 --> 1:44:14.578
You brought that shank in with you,
it's premeditated murder.

1:44:16.357 --> 1:44:18.120
Law don't care who you kill.

1:44:23.564 --> 1:44:26.055
I guess the law didn't care much
for Winston, either.

1:44:55.461 --> 1:44:57.929
[Birds chirping]

1:45:25.523 --> 1:45:27.286
Bye. See you guys later.

1:45:27.359 --> 1:45:28.656
OK, sweetheart.

1:46:16.505 --> 1:46:44.040
