00:01.400 --> 00:02.840
<i>Dr. Diana Bishop.</i>

00:03.000 --> 00:05.960
<i>She's a witch and a powerful one</i>
<i>if her family's anything to go by.</i>

00:06.120 --> 00:08.360
<i>Professor Clairmont.</i>
<i>You're a vampire.</i>

00:08.520 --> 00:11.360
<i>-You're studying vampire genetics?</i>
<i>-Witches and daemons, too.</i>

00:11.520 --> 00:14.240
The work we're doing here
proves the creatures are dying out.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.760
<i>-What about </i>The Book of Life<i>?</i>
<i>-Three pages were cut out.</i>

00:16.920 --> 00:20.000
You think 792 is gonna
help you with your research?

00:20.160 --> 00:23.760
<i>-What is the covenant?</i>
-It forbids interspecies relationships.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.280
Your father set up the congregation
to keep peace amongst the species.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.360
Your brother
has broken that peace.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.360
Your power's extraordinary.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.840
<i>She needs to learn control.</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:35.600
Do you think that you might
just have time-warped?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.840
The witches will think that
Diana has turned her back

00:38.000 --> 00:39.920
<i>on her own kind</i>
<i>and they will come.</i>

00:40.080 --> 00:42.480
What if we hide
somewhere in time?

00:42.640 --> 00:44.680
There has to be somewhere
I can learn about my magic.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.560
My father told me to give this
to the one who has need of it.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.400
I lost that on All Souls' Night
a very long time ago.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.600
<i>They know where you are.</i>
<i>Go now.</i>

01:05.840 --> 01:08.440
What is it, a cloaking spell?

01:09.680 --> 01:12.080
Peter, can you feel it?

01:13.200 --> 01:14.520
The magic she used.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.440
Whatever it is, it's a decoy.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.880
She wants us chasing our tails.
Oh, they were definitely here.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.320
They were wearing these clothes
just moments ago.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.840
Why stop to change if they were
in such a rush to escape?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
What if they were
going somewhere

01:29.160 --> 01:33.320
and they couldn't be seen
in modern-day clothes?

01:35.600 --> 01:39.480
She's a timewalker.
She's powerful enough.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.560
Where better to hide from us
than in the past?

01:41.720 --> 01:43.600
Where better to look
for <i>The Book of Life.</i>

01:43.760 --> 01:46.400
Wherever they are,
they can't stay gone forever.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.080
We'll wait.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.080
I'm very good at waiting.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.240
-She will come this year.
-I know it.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.520
We have had
the portents from the north.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.280
I have watched the heavens.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.360
This is the All Hallows
of the prophecy.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.080
I know it.

02:32.240 --> 02:36.120
She will arrive this night,

02:36.280 --> 02:39.240
our fearsome witch.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.120
Where are we?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.160
Not where I had hoped.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.040
This way.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.080
-You know this place?
-Oh, yes.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.440
Very well.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.000
This house is never empty.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.600
Stay behind me.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.080
Who the hell are you?

04:39.960 --> 04:42.360
Matt. Stand down. She's with me.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.760
She is a witch.
I am sure of it.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.880
Master Roydon. We weren't expecting you
for weeks yet.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.400
-Send for Raleigh. He is bewitched.
-Kit... Enough!

04:55.560 --> 04:58.280
Let me make this
exceedingly clear.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.080
I am perfectly well
and in my right mind.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.880
This is Diana.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.320
And if you want to keep
a tongue in your head,

05:06.480 --> 05:08.280
you will speak of her
with respect.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.800
She's here not as my guest,
but as lady of the house.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.520
She is...

05:15.840 --> 05:18.320
She is my wife, Kit.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.720
We should have arrived
in the country.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.240
Sixty miles off course.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.560
I wonder what I did wrong.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.720
You say wrong,
but look where we are.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.720
You got the right year,
the right night even.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.320
-You did it.
-Your wife did it.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.440
Mmm, I'm sorry about that.
Kit can be extremely...

05:43.600 --> 05:47.960
Protective. And suspicious,
as he has every right to be.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.960
Can't believe Christopher
Marlowe is a daemon.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.920
Can't believe
you didn't tell me.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.200
What?

05:56.360 --> 05:58.120
They'll know
that I fed on you,

05:58.280 --> 06:00.160
and they won't understand.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.960
A witch living with a wearh
is strange enough.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.320
-Nowhere?
-A wearh. A vampire.

06:06.480 --> 06:10.280
Promise me that you'll keep it
covered up, always.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.640
Master Marlowe
has sent for Sir Walter

06:16.800 --> 06:18.280
and the Earl
of Northumberland.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.320
Humans, friends,
but we can trust them.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.840
Francoise, find something for Diana
to wear, would you?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.960
Do we still have
some of Louisa's old clothes?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.760
Thank you, Francoise.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.160
The Earl of Northumberland

06:37.320 --> 06:40.840
and Sir Walter...
Sir Walter Raleigh?

06:43.240 --> 06:44.560
You're Matthew Roydon.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.680
<i>The School of Night</i>
Matthew Roydon,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.640
the only member of the group
that we know nothing about.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.000
For good reason.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.600
Now I have to
become him again.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.440
Is that really so bad?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.120
Won't being
in the center of things

06:58.280 --> 07:00.000
make it easier
to find <i>The Book of Life?</i>

07:00.160 --> 07:04.120
I hope so. I just thought that
we could lay low,

07:04.280 --> 07:06.880
get what we need
and get out again. No mess.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.720
Speaking of which,
I really need to deal with Kit.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.120
When did you first
cross paths with her?

07:49.600 --> 07:52.640
-Do you remember?
-Kit.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.480
I'm not under a spell.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.920
Just indulge me.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
I'm sorry, old friend.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.960
It wasn't the best way
to tell you, I know.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.480
-I'm not under a spell.
-A witch?

08:13.640 --> 08:16.400
You spoke civilly to one,
I'd be concerned, but married?

08:16.560 --> 08:19.520
I expect you
to take me at my word...

08:19.680 --> 08:22.240
Until you are you again,

08:23.320 --> 08:26.320
I shall imagine you a stranger.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.480
Come in.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.360
Thank you.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.200
Does Matthew's sister
visit often?

08:56.360 --> 08:58.520
You need to come out
of that shift.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.000
Okay.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.160
Who did that to you?

09:11.840 --> 09:13.720
It was...

09:13.880 --> 09:15.280
It was a fellow witch.

09:15.440 --> 09:19.440
Matthew and I...
It hasn't been easy.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.960
Well, don't you mind these
old clothes, Mistress Roydon.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.840
We'll have a nice new wardrobe
for you presently.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.680
Thank you.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.000
And we would
have made faster progress.

09:43.160 --> 09:47.240
Diana, Lord Henry Percy,
Earl of Northumberland

09:47.400 --> 09:49.680
and Sir Walter Raleigh.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.160
It's an honor to meet you.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.360
I don't recognize your accent.
Where are you from?

09:57.520 --> 09:58.920
Cambridge.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.120
I do beg your pardon,
Mistress Roydon.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.000
I'm a little hard of hearing.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.720
-I... I'm from Cambridge, my lord.
-I would not have guessed.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.680
Well, perhaps somewhat
to the west of Cambridge.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.400
Gentlemen,
there are two matters.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.880
Firstly, Diana is in need
of a teacher.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.080
A witch.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.280
Her parents died
when she was very young.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.840
Therefore, she lacks training.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.760
I'm sure between us
we can find someone discreet.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.200
And the other matter?

10:28.360 --> 10:31.280
We need to locate a lost book,
an alchemical manuscript.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.520
The book contains information
about the wilder creatures.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.200
Not the <i>Book of Mysteries</i>?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.720
Surely... The very same.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.840
It has details of the origins
of the three creatures,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.480
if it exists.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.560
It exists.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.560
We must tread carefully.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.280
People will talk
if they see you with a witch.

10:56.440 --> 11:01.120
And if it's discretion you want,
I'd keep that indoors.

11:02.440 --> 11:06.280
Kit may be right, Mistress,
though his manners are wanting.

11:06.440 --> 11:11.040
Your accent, even your choice
of words, sets you apart.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.160
Perhaps it would be wiser
to settle in first.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.920
Fine.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.760
I'll lay low
until I find my feet.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.400
But no one is
keeping me anywhere.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.000
It's too early for bed.
I might sleep for a month.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.080
I have to go out.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.880
Tonight?
What for?

11:43.040 --> 11:46.120
There are certain people
I have to reach out to.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.040
Reorient myself.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.160
I remember the broad strokes
of all of this,

11:50.320 --> 11:54.240
but it has been over 400 years.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.440
We'll find a teacher
in the morning, won't we?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.280
As soon as
I can master my magic,

12:03.440 --> 12:05.920
we'll find the book ourselves.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.080
And we can get home again.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.520
Believe me,

12:12.680 --> 12:14.760
I'm counting on it.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.680
Come, witch.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.560
Sophie?

13:58.400 --> 14:02.200
She must be Sophie's ancestor.
She has to be.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.480
She's a witch and...

14:05.600 --> 14:07.320
The chess piece.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.520
This is how it gets to her family.
That woman becomes my teacher.

14:10.680 --> 14:15.080
What if it was her magic
luring you outside?

14:15.240 --> 14:21.120
No, it wasn't. It was me.
I had a new way of seeing, of knowing.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.560
Matthew. I'm right.
This is a good thing.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.440
You should have waited for me.
How am I supposed to protect you?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.720
-Protect me?
-Yes!

14:35.480 --> 14:37.280
How am I supposed
to protect you

14:37.440 --> 14:39.040
if you won't share things
with me?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.480
All right.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.160
-Where were you tonight?
-I told you,

14:45.320 --> 14:48.240
I had people
I had to reach out to.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.040
So it's okay for me to worry
about you out there alone,

14:53.200 --> 14:54.520
but when I step foot outside...

14:54.680 --> 14:57.160
-That's different and you know it.
-Is it?

14:57.320 --> 15:00.200
You don't protect me, Matthew.
We protect each other.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.440
Book or no book,
neither of us are getting back home

15:02.600 --> 15:04.120
unless I find the right teacher.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.680
This woman, she is a gift.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.280
We should be grabbing it with
both hands, not running scared.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.320
I never run scared
of anything in my life.

15:13.840 --> 15:17.800
I simply won't take risks
where your safety is concerned.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.520
Well, I'm not staying
locked up in here.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.040
So either you find me that witch

15:22.200 --> 15:25.680
or I will go out there
and I'll find her myself.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.440
Good morning.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.960
Morning.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.120
Show me the building
that she came out of

15:53.280 --> 15:55.480
and I'll get Walter
on the case.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.160
That man can find anyone.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.680
Oh!

16:00.880 --> 16:03.280
Thank you. Thank you.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.760
I know it's what
we're meant to do.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.040
Not that I'm complaining,

16:10.200 --> 16:13.320
but I thought you were in
a hurry to get outside.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.080
You said
you were sending Walter.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.400
To find the witch.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.400
I thought that I might show you
something of the city.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.280
Yes.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.720
If, and I mean this,

16:25.880 --> 16:29.560
only if Francoise
has your new clothes ready.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.000
You are not going anywhere
in that monstrosity.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.720
It's over 20 years old
and intended for court.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.720
Matthew de Clermont.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.160
Were you keeping me indoors

16:43.320 --> 16:46.080
because you didn't want to be
seen with a fashion victim?

16:46.240 --> 16:47.840
Well, I mean, look at me.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.440
I do have a reputation
to uphold.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.080
Excellent!

17:40.480 --> 17:42.000
Mistress Roydon.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.800
Yes.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.640
Hey.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.120
Did you always get
this much attention?

18:10.280 --> 18:13.080
Perhaps. I don't recall.

18:22.680 --> 18:27.160
All these people here.
London is still so tiny.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.920
I always told my students that.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.840
Cities of the past
would have smelled awful.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.800
-Trust me, parts of it do.
-Not these parts.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.520
Well, I can always take you
to a tannery yard if you'd like.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.520
Old St. Paul's. It's huge.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.120
Well, it helps not being dwarfed
by a skyscraper too.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.720
I just... I just keep thinking.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.480
Okay, now it finally feels real.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.000
But now it does. Now...

18:59.160 --> 19:01.920
Now it finally feels real.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.960
Well, we should probably
get back then.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.000
Hey.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.000
Come on.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.880
What's wrong?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.880
Damn it.

19:38.560 --> 19:42.640
Surely not. You're mistaken.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.400
He's taken pains
to alter his appearance,

19:45.560 --> 19:47.120
but it was him.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.200
I'm sure of it.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.120
It must be important
to have you so rattled.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.880
I'm not rattled, Diana.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.480
I'm annoyed at myself
for being so careless.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.000
Now it's known that I'm in London,
I have to pay my respects.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.120
It's a waste of time, that's all.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.880
But you won't tell me who he is.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.760
He's no one,
an associate of Kit's.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.760
I should have reported him
right away.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.320
The truth is, I'm not sure
I'll pass muster.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.000
If he wanted details of what
I've been up to then...

20:20.160 --> 20:23.600
Would Kit know?
Can you ask him?

20:27.440 --> 20:29.760
Ask him what?

20:29.920 --> 20:33.480
Could you remind me of
what I was doing last week?

20:33.640 --> 20:36.600
No.

20:36.760 --> 20:40.160
No. I'll take my chances.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.920
We'll get you a teacher.
Find the manuscript.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.560
And we'll get the hell out
of here as soon as we can.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.200
I must go.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.640
And don't leave until I return.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.280
Why don't you have another,
Master Pole?

21:25.520 --> 21:28.440
You're not...

21:28.600 --> 21:30.320
Have I done something wrong?

21:30.480 --> 21:34.760
Tell me.
What was I doing out of London?

21:34.920 --> 21:37.120
This is a test.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.200
They're not concerns,

21:39.360 --> 21:42.200
but leaking of information,
chatter in the ranks.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.120
I 'd never talk, I swear it.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.920
I know. I know, William.

21:47.080 --> 21:51.560
But you were always
a very good listener.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.880
Word was

21:58.040 --> 22:00.280
they sent you up north
to Berwick.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.200
The Scottish king's
got his hands full

22:02.360 --> 22:04.120
rounding up witches.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.840
I heard they had you

22:06.000 --> 22:10.280
keeping him focused on his
own affairs instead of...

22:10.440 --> 22:12.040
Well, you know...

22:12.200 --> 22:14.400
What we're doing down here.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.000
I do.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.680
Go on.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.360
Leave us.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.680
So it's true.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.280
-Explain yourself.
-Forgive me, Lord Burghley,

22:47.440 --> 22:51.480
but you asked me to stay in Berwick
only until my errand was concluded.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.160
Your errand was not
a short-term endeavor.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.080
The seeds of chaos are sown.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.800
The Scottish courts are in disarray.
The witches are divided.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.040
If they're not in hiding, then
they're up in arms against the king.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.720
To tarry longer
would have risked detection.

23:07.680 --> 23:11.160
Unless, of course, your intention
was to have me discovered.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.960
All right.

23:18.120 --> 23:23.040
We shall see how this chaos
of yours plays out.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.560
Very well.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.320
Oh, and Roydon.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.280
I'll have further use for you
now that you're home.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.640
Your methods of persuasion
have been sorely missed.

23:38.800 --> 23:43.200
No slipping away
without my leave. Understood?

23:46.080 --> 23:48.880
Of course, my lord.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.240
Matthew.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.080
The royal seal.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.440
"My trusty shadow..."

26:13.240 --> 26:14.680
Oh, Matthew.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.680
I hope I wasn't unwise
to place my trust in you.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.000
You weren't.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.680
I already knew he was Catholic.
He told me.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.200
Well, if you'd
bewitched him,

26:36.360 --> 26:38.120
he'd tell you anything.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.360
Listen to my heartbeat,
Francoise.

26:41.520 --> 26:45.320
I will not tell a soul what
I've seen up here. I promise.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.400
I suspected that he was a spy.

26:49.440 --> 26:53.520
I just, I hadn't put it
together until now.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.320
He's identifying Catholics.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.920
Betraying his own
people, his faith.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.760
Yes.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.240
He is.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.160
Diana?

27:27.880 --> 27:30.280
You look...

27:31.640 --> 27:33.920
I don't know.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.320
Older.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.080
Well,

27:41.520 --> 27:43.360
that's a first.

27:53.440 --> 27:58.400
-How did it go?
-He remains convinced for now, I think.

28:03.840 --> 28:05.600
Why do you do it?

28:07.480 --> 28:09.560
Because it is
my duty.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.720
To your father.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.840
I was wondering
when he'd come up.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.720
He is in France.
We won't encounter him.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.400
Come to bed.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.160
What?

28:28.200 --> 28:31.800
There's nothing more to say that
you haven't already discovered.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.680
My father needed a spy
in the English court.

28:42.840 --> 28:46.360
I fulfilled that need
and I did it very well.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.400
Until now, apparently.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.600
Not even Philippe de Clermont thought

28:53.760 --> 28:55.920
to factor in time travel
when he gave his orders.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.440
But he knew you were Catholic
when he sent you here.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.800
Of course.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.560
What... Come to bed.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.040
Please.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.400
You're the only thing
that makes sense here.

29:46.680 --> 29:50.000
Master Roydon.
The witch you were seeking.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.560
-Mistress.
-Wearh.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.600
This woman is under my protection.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.160
She's without family
and in need of your assistance.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.000
She shows signs
of being a witch.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.480
We shall see.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.240
As I suspected, she is no witch.

30:21.400 --> 30:25.000
Do not play games.
Truth. Now.

30:25.160 --> 30:28.800
You sought my opinion,
wearh, Now you have it.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.320
I think you do sense
that I have power.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.400
Please.
My magic led me to you, I am sure.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.400
There must be some other way
that you can test my ability.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.000
Consider your answer.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.840
You do not want me
for an enemy.

30:56.840 --> 31:00.560
A true witch can unravel the ties
that bind the order of things.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.640
She can relight a flame

31:05.800 --> 31:08.480
and stop a bell
from ringing.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.920
Well, go on.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.640
Try again, Diana.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.680
I saw her lighting
candles only days ago.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.000
There now.
It is as I told you.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.120
Wait.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.800
Let me try again.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.840
Diana, stop.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.520
Enough.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.880
You can keep your money.
I will have no part of this.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.240
I won't hurt you.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.080
I don't know
what that was,

32:44.240 --> 32:46.320
but you must see,
I need your help.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.960
It's power like yours, that's why
they're hunting us in Scotland.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.760
It's why even here,
we have no peace

32:50.920 --> 32:53.640
from men like
your husband.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.040
Who else thinks
we're married?

33:19.200 --> 33:21.640
Besides your friends
and the servants.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.120
Well, neighbors might
have assumed. Why?

33:26.520 --> 33:28.600
She called you
my husband.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.840
Move those fingers
even a hair

33:33.000 --> 33:35.080
and I'll have your ear, boy.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.960
Matthew, he's a child.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.840
I ought to haul you in front
of the bailiff, young man.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.080
But you won't
and neither will I.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.600
-What's your name?
-Jack, milady.

33:53.760 --> 33:58.040
Jack.
That's a nice name.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.040
Where are your parents?
Your family...

34:01.200 --> 34:02.960
I haven't any, milady.

34:04.640 --> 34:09.480
Had you ever heard anything
about me before today?

34:09.640 --> 34:13.240
No matter how silly
it may sound.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.280
They reckon you're a witch.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.120
I see.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.240
But you're not afraid.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.680
No such thing as witches.

34:25.840 --> 34:30.080
I don't suppose you might know
where the rumors started.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.680
Hmm.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.880
'Course I do.

34:35.040 --> 34:38.560
Nothing happens on Water
Lane that I don't know about.

34:40.480 --> 34:43.120
It was in the tavern.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.840
The one on the corner.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.560
The Lamb.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.240
I hope that what
you saw earlier

34:53.400 --> 34:56.680
won't stop you from helping
us to find the book.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.840
Not at all. I've already written
to a friend in Oxford,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.280
and I'm hopeful they will
assist in the search.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.160
Matt, I'll never be used to
your face without a beard.

35:05.320 --> 35:09.360
Although, I must say, it makes
your lip far easier to read.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.680
Taken out your earring, too.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.120
Many changes since
we saw you last.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.480
Tell me, Walter, have you had a drink
at The Lamb recently?

35:18.640 --> 35:21.760
Nay.
In that rat nest? Hardly.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.240
It's Kit who's never
out of the place.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.320
Why do you ask?

35:31.680 --> 35:34.760
Walter, I'll see you
and Henry tomorrow.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.400
Are you all right, Matt?

35:39.560 --> 35:41.040
Good night, Henry.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.320
You talked about Diana.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.760
Don't even bother
trying to deny it.

36:06.920 --> 36:09.520
Why would I deny it?

36:09.680 --> 36:12.040
I'd do the same again.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.280
I had your loyalty. I know I did.
Where is it now?

36:17.440 --> 36:20.200
-You still have it.
-He can't breathe, Matthew.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.360
Can you not see things
from my perspective?

36:24.520 --> 36:26.520
You're meant to be in
Scotland with Gallowglass.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.960
Not here, married to a witch
with no word of explanation!

36:30.120 --> 36:33.200
You're not yourself, Matthew.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.560
We have to tell him.
You saw what my magic did today.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.800
He's gonna keep making trouble
until I'm gone.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.680
He knows you.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.160
When he hears the truth,
he'll believe it.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.320
You won't get another
chance with me.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.880
I told Walter that
I'm from Cambridge.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.480
And I am.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.320
But not the Cambridge you know.

37:14.480 --> 37:18.080
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
It's a colony in the New World.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.680
I've never heard of it.

37:20.840 --> 37:24.760
Not the New World as it is now,
but of the future.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.520
She claims she is
a time spinner.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.400
My friend,
you are further gone than I thought.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.080
I know that
she's a time spinner

37:36.240 --> 37:38.960
because I traveled
with her here myself.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.440
You?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.840
Matthew is not behaving
like the man he was

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
because he is not
the man you know.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.000
Not quite.
Not anymore.

37:49.160 --> 37:53.760
Pretend for a moment that
I believe this story.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.440
Where is the Matthew
from this time?

37:57.600 --> 38:00.680
The one who traveled
north but weeks ago.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.160
We're not sure.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.440
It is possible that when we arrived,
he was displaced.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.880
Displaced?

38:08.040 --> 38:11.200
Oh, you do,
you do not mean dead?

38:11.360 --> 38:14.240
No. When we leave, things should
go back to how they were.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.880
Listen to me, Kit.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.200
If you were ever my friend,
be my friend now,

38:20.360 --> 38:22.360
accept us, both of us.

38:22.520 --> 38:25.200
Or you can leave this
house and never come back.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.120
Either way,

38:28.280 --> 38:32.120
if you breathe a word
of this to anyone,

38:33.440 --> 38:35.920
so help me God,

38:37.560 --> 38:39.160
I'll end you.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.400
One of Cecil's men.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.600
Thank you.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.600
Matthew?

39:46.560 --> 39:48.720
He's gone out.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.800
He didn't wake you?

39:54.440 --> 39:56.120
Was he all right?

39:57.440 --> 40:02.280
-Difficult to tell.
-Yes. It often is with him.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.720
Wine?

40:18.920 --> 40:21.160
If you are sincere
in your affection,

40:21.320 --> 40:24.720
then you deserve
a warning.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.600
Your Matthew he is

40:28.360 --> 40:30.040
different.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.000
Gentler, I think.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.880
Being back here,

40:36.040 --> 40:39.880
wearing the cloak
of his old self, it will...

40:41.120 --> 40:47.400
change him, his work, his enemies,
even his allies.

40:47.560 --> 40:52.040
By the end of it, he will not be
your Matthew any longer.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.680
I know what you're doing, Kit.

40:54.840 --> 40:58.560
You think if we go,
you get your Matthew back.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.480
I have wit enough to know
that he has never been that.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.640
You know what I mean.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.400
I have seen Matthew
at his worst,

41:09.320 --> 41:12.000
but I fear you are
out of your depth.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.360
With respect,
you don't know me.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.000
-No.
-No.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.680
When you met him,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.680
he singled you out.

41:30.840 --> 41:34.320
You were entirely uncommon.

41:35.600 --> 41:39.000
Exceptional in a way
that he could not define.

41:40.520 --> 41:43.160
And although there was
a darkness in him,

41:43.320 --> 41:47.680
it was somehow as though
you had always known him.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.200
The way he talked,

41:49.360 --> 41:52.360
it was as if all
those many lifetimes

41:52.520 --> 41:57.520
he had lived before
were just marking time

42:00.360 --> 42:02.360
until he met you.

42:05.840 --> 42:08.040
Stay then, if you must.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.840
But do not for one moment,
assume you know him.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.480
<i>We have a problem.</i>

43:05.600 --> 43:08.040
That book started
this whole nightmare.

43:20.240 --> 43:23.120
One cannot forget
your disdain for witches.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.680
Seeing as witches succeeded
in repelling the armada,

43:25.840 --> 43:29.160
surely their loyalty
is above suspicion.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.880
No one is above suspicion.
