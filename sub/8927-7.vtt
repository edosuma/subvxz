WEBVTT

00:03.808 --> 00:07.309
Tonight I will submit myself
as captain of this combined crew.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.644
I intend to lead the men
in retaking the fort,

00:09.646 --> 00:12.314
having ended your tyranny
over this place for good.

00:12.316 --> 00:15.150
MAX: She's adrift.
Alone in the most terrifying way.

00:15.152 --> 00:16.985
You know who I am?

00:16.987 --> 00:19.654
I think you know who that is.
I will protect you.

00:19.656 --> 00:21.323
The captain of Scarborough,

00:21.325 --> 00:24.993
he offered me and nine men
of my choosing full pardons

00:24.995 --> 00:28.630
if I would aid him in the capture
of a fugitive from justice.

00:28.632 --> 00:30.465
You understand what
I'm asking you to do?

00:30.467 --> 00:31.633
Go back and watch the gold.

00:31.635 --> 00:33.301
Keep watch on the Spanish soldiers

00:33.303 --> 00:34.636
who are watching the gold.

00:34.638 --> 00:36.805
FLINT:
Her father is a very influential man.

00:36.807 --> 00:40.475
If I return her to him,
I believe that I can win him as an ally.

00:40.477 --> 00:43.311
Courting Lord Ashe and
retrieving the Urca gold

00:43.313 --> 00:44.646
are working against each other.

00:44.648 --> 00:46.648
If you prevent any further
attack on the fort,

00:46.650 --> 00:48.483
I will bring the girl down from the hill

00:48.485 --> 00:49.818
and deliver her to you.

00:49.820 --> 00:52.140
You are no longer a hostage.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

02:29.871 --> 02:32.299
ABIGAIL:
I remember music...

02:35.125 --> 02:37.175
in her home.

02:40.297 --> 02:43.131
It was always so warm there, so lovely.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.967
(Men chatting)

02:47.257 --> 02:50.472
ABIGAIL: And I remember when I would
visit there with Mother and Father,

02:50.474 --> 02:52.307
how she would lean down

02:52.309 --> 02:54.526
so her face was very near mine

02:54.528 --> 02:56.895
- and she's smile.
- (Rats squeaking)

02:58.698 --> 03:02.534
I remember hoping
I'd be so beautiful one day.

03:02.536 --> 03:08.490
And I remember watching her talk
with my mother from across the room

03:08.492 --> 03:11.159
and how she'd make my mother laugh.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.300
And you're saying she's here?

03:19.302 --> 03:21.302
Lady Hamilton is on this island?

03:21.304 --> 03:24.138
She is. She's a friend

03:24.140 --> 03:25.974
and she wants to help
rescue you from this place.

03:25.976 --> 03:27.976
But I don't understand.

03:27.978 --> 03:31.980
Captain Vane gave me his word
I'd be unharmed here.

03:31.982 --> 03:33.982
Things have changed.

03:33.984 --> 03:36.484
Things are changing as we speak tonight.

03:36.486 --> 03:38.653
You are now worth more to him as part

03:38.655 --> 03:40.655
of a very dangerous
game here on the island.

03:40.657 --> 03:42.156
As such, he has no intention

03:42.158 --> 03:45.326
of returning you to your
father any time soon.

03:45.328 --> 03:49.447
Trust me. Trust Mrs. Hamilton

03:49.449 --> 03:51.783
and know that we must
leave this place now.

03:51.785 --> 03:54.202
How?

03:54.204 --> 03:56.704
There is a network of tunnels
that run beneath the fort.

03:56.706 --> 03:59.040
And the entrance to
one of them isn't far.

03:59.042 --> 04:00.708
By the time anyone
realizes you are gone,

04:00.710 --> 04:03.378
you will be safely away from here
and in the care of Captain Flint.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.013
(Gasps)

04:10.637 --> 04:13.021
I remember Lady Hamilton's face.

04:15.642 --> 04:17.976
But I know Captain Flint's name.

04:17.978 --> 04:20.478
My father's mentioned it in his letters.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.615
He says Captain Flint is the most
wicked of the New World pirates.

04:23.617 --> 04:26.284
That he's evil.

04:26.286 --> 04:30.622
Promise me that my escape
isn't some awful ruse

04:30.624 --> 04:33.658
to deliver me from one madman
into the hands of another.

04:36.296 --> 04:38.997
Captain Flint is a good man.

04:41.801 --> 04:44.802
If you don't trust my word about it...

04:44.804 --> 04:47.005
trust hers.

04:52.812 --> 04:55.013
Where do we go?

04:55.015 --> 04:58.016
(Men clamoring)

04:58.018 --> 05:00.234
Shut up. Just get it done.

05:13.450 --> 05:15.667
BILLY:
Where's your count?

05:17.621 --> 05:19.287
Hard to tell.

05:19.289 --> 05:22.790
Everyone's holding this one close.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.460
Well, I'm hearing you're up three.

05:25.462 --> 05:27.629
I have it as four.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.130
- You have Dobson as a nay.
- Yes.

05:29.132 --> 05:30.798
- Brewer's a nay.
- Yes.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.800
- Winslow?
- Winslow?

05:32.802 --> 05:34.469
No, he's a yea vote.

05:34.471 --> 05:36.304
When did you ask him?

05:36.306 --> 05:39.140
A little while ago.
Why, has something happened?

05:39.142 --> 05:41.643
He got into it with
Muldoon over last mess,

05:41.645 --> 05:44.646
said Muldoon was chewing
too loud or something.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.482
Muldoon brought his mother into it.

05:47.484 --> 05:50.818
Muldoon's in your camp,
so Winslow flipped as a "fuck you."

05:52.489 --> 05:55.373
- Seriously.
- (Scoffs)

05:55.375 --> 05:57.542
- That's a good one.
- Yeah.

05:57.544 --> 05:59.043
My seamanship,

05:59.045 --> 06:02.664
my prospects for garnering plunder,

06:02.666 --> 06:04.799
my skill in a fight,
the sound of my voice,

06:04.801 --> 06:06.634
the sound of another man's eating.

06:06.636 --> 06:08.803
I suppose at the end of the day,

06:08.805 --> 06:10.805
they're all functionally equivalent.

06:10.807 --> 06:14.842
A man casts his vote for the same
reason he does anything in his life.

06:16.479 --> 06:18.479
Why's that?

06:18.481 --> 06:21.482
Because it feels good.

06:21.484 --> 06:24.485
Three votes, four votes.

06:24.487 --> 06:27.855
30 of them will change their minds
before they raise their hands tonight.

06:29.159 --> 06:31.659
The thing that will decide this vote

06:31.661 --> 06:33.027
hasn't happened yet.

06:34.948 --> 06:37.448
You're going to convince
them they'll feel better

06:37.450 --> 06:38.783
about voting for you over him.

06:38.785 --> 06:41.953
I think I've got a pretty strong case.

06:41.955 --> 06:44.288
His way, a lot of them will die tonight.

06:44.290 --> 06:46.958
My way, they won't
and we'll gain the favor

06:46.960 --> 06:50.845
of a man who could move this place
a step closer to sustainability.

06:52.966 --> 06:55.550
BILLY:
Perhaps.

06:55.552 --> 06:58.720
Though, still, his argument
would seem to be the easier one.

06:58.722 --> 07:01.389
- You think?
- Sure.

07:01.391 --> 07:05.476
"Captain Flint will betray
anyone to get what he wants."

07:05.478 --> 07:09.113
Yesterday it was Mr. Gates,
today it was me.

07:09.115 --> 07:11.649
"Which one of you would
like to be tomorrow?"

07:14.621 --> 07:16.320
DUFRESNE:
Captain?

07:19.626 --> 07:20.992
They're ready.

07:24.798 --> 07:27.832
(Men chatting)

07:32.806 --> 07:35.673
There's only one item for
consideration tonight.

07:37.310 --> 07:39.510
Captain Hornigold?

07:51.775 --> 07:54.859
HORNIGOLD:
A man asks for your trust,

07:54.861 --> 07:58.863
he asks and offers you
things in the future.

07:58.865 --> 08:02.533
And the brighter those things may be,
the more you must ask yourself,

08:02.535 --> 08:06.504
"What is it they are intended
to blind me to in the present?"

08:10.794 --> 08:12.960
It's no surprise that that man

08:12.962 --> 08:16.130
wants to shift your
attention to the future.

08:16.132 --> 08:18.966
To the things he says he can give you.

08:18.968 --> 08:21.636
To the hardships he can remove.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.807
A most shining future
it would have to be

08:25.809 --> 08:28.309
for him to blind you to the cowardly

08:28.311 --> 08:30.978
and devious acts of his past...

08:30.980 --> 08:34.649
theft, betrayal, lies, murder!

08:34.650 --> 08:36.317
(Men shouting)

08:36.318 --> 08:38.820
HORNIGOLD: When we first elected
to merge these crews...

08:38.822 --> 08:40.321
Where the fuck have you been?

08:40.323 --> 08:42.490
A launch landed on the
beach a short while ago.

08:42.491 --> 08:44.826
The news it brings is of
the upmost importance.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.994
More important than losing
our ship to Captain Hornigold?

08:46.996 --> 08:48.796
Yes.

08:48.798 --> 08:52.466
HORNIGOLD: ...have been wrenched from us
by men of the worst sort...

08:52.468 --> 08:55.002
They're supposed to be watching
over the gold until we arrive.

08:55.004 --> 08:56.671
What the fuck are they doing back?

08:56.673 --> 08:59.006
Because there's no longer
any gold to watch over.

08:59.008 --> 09:01.509
It's gone.

09:01.511 --> 09:02.677
- MAN: It's gone.
- MAN #2: Did he say gone?

09:02.679 --> 09:04.145
MAN #3:
Did someone say gone?

09:04.147 --> 09:06.314
The gold is gone.
You hear that? It's gone!

09:06.316 --> 09:08.850
(Men clamoring)

09:10.200 --> 09:12.320
- MAN: The gold is gone!
- MAN #2: I don't believe it.

09:12.322 --> 09:14.021
MAN #3:
Who could've taken it?

09:28.621 --> 09:30.004
This is clean.

09:50.643 --> 09:53.144
It is as if it never happened.

09:53.146 --> 09:56.781
Anything tying you to
yesterday's events is gone.

09:56.783 --> 09:59.116
There will be questions, of course,

09:59.118 --> 10:00.952
but should any find their way to you,

10:00.954 --> 10:04.956
know that the other girls are
discussing openly downstairs

10:04.958 --> 10:08.626
Charlotte and her lover's decision
to escape together to Providence.

10:08.628 --> 10:11.329
All you need to do is say the same.

10:24.978 --> 10:28.596
These will not fit you,
but they are clean.

10:28.598 --> 10:32.099
When you are ready, I will be downstairs

10:32.101 --> 10:35.486
and we can discuss what comes next.

10:41.444 --> 10:44.161
I was married to a man once.

10:45.615 --> 10:49.450
Rotten fuck...

10:49.452 --> 10:52.119
raised his hands at me,

10:52.121 --> 10:54.872
burned me,

10:54.874 --> 10:57.091
shared me with his men.

10:58.044 --> 11:00.845
I didn't know any different,

11:00.847 --> 11:02.880
didn't know I could
do anything about it.

11:04.467 --> 11:06.634
Even if I had,

11:06.636 --> 11:08.970
I wouldn't have thought I had it in me.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.808
One day, we were in a tavern.

11:13.810 --> 11:17.144
He was hurting me.

11:17.146 --> 11:20.147
And a man saw it.

11:20.149 --> 11:23.651
And he walked over...

11:23.653 --> 11:25.653
and he slit his throat.

11:30.159 --> 11:31.826
That was Jack.

11:34.797 --> 11:37.498
I was 13.

11:41.304 --> 11:44.638
I always thought
he saved me from something.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.008
Always been so fucking grateful.

11:48.644 --> 11:50.678
Now I wonder...

11:52.815 --> 11:54.515
maybe Jack took me from something

11:54.517 --> 11:57.068
I was supposed to figure
my own way out of.

11:59.355 --> 12:03.240
Maybe he took away the chance
to get strong enough to save myself.

12:06.329 --> 12:07.995
To grow up.

12:11.284 --> 12:13.617
Instead, I went with him,

12:13.619 --> 12:16.287
did what he did,

12:16.289 --> 12:18.672
did what the others did.

12:21.794 --> 12:23.677
Thought I'd become one of them.

12:30.470 --> 12:34.138
If I'm not what I was when I was born,

12:34.140 --> 12:36.857
and I ain't what I've become instead...

12:38.811 --> 12:41.312
what the fuck am I?

12:55.211 --> 12:57.244
She's going to rest for now.

12:59.382 --> 13:02.383
I know this is the last
thing you need to hear,

13:02.385 --> 13:04.668
but me and the girls were talking.

13:06.806 --> 13:09.974
We know what risks
we face with the turns.

13:09.976 --> 13:13.177
How to avoid them, protect against them.

13:14.597 --> 13:16.931
- What she did to Charlotte...
- Don't.

13:16.933 --> 13:19.600
That's not something we
know how to protect against.

13:19.602 --> 13:21.936
Shouldn't we be focusing on
getting her out the door right now

13:21.938 --> 13:24.438
before it's one of us next?

13:24.440 --> 13:27.108
Please don't be the voice of this.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.610
If you're concerned that by
removing her from this place

13:29.612 --> 13:31.946
she could get violent with you,

13:31.948 --> 13:34.115
there are men we can talk to

13:34.117 --> 13:35.783
about making sure she can't hurt you.

13:35.785 --> 13:37.952
I don't want to hear that again.

13:37.954 --> 13:40.671
Not from you,
not from the other girls, ever.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.126
When no one in the world...

13:45.128 --> 13:48.963
no one... no one...

13:48.965 --> 13:52.466
could care less about what those men
were doing to me on the beach,

13:52.468 --> 13:54.685
she did.

13:54.687 --> 13:57.021
That means something to me.

13:57.023 --> 14:02.026
So for as long as she desires,
this place will be a safe place for her.

14:02.028 --> 14:06.313
And those men you would talk
to about solving this problem?

14:06.315 --> 14:08.482
They value their relationship with me

14:08.484 --> 14:11.652
far more than they do
yours or Isabella's

14:11.654 --> 14:15.156
or anyone on that floor.

14:15.158 --> 14:18.826
If I hear from those men that
inquiries have been made about them,

14:18.828 --> 14:22.329
I will not receive that news well.
Is that clear?

14:29.472 --> 14:31.505
Idelle...

14:35.478 --> 14:38.679
please let the girls know
I understand their concern.

14:40.316 --> 14:43.317
If any one of them wish to come to me,

14:43.319 --> 14:45.653
my door is open.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.521
I will.

14:52.495 --> 14:56.530
Two guardacosta men-of-war sitting
right in the bay when we arrived.

14:56.532 --> 14:58.365
We made our way down to
the ridge and watched

14:58.367 --> 15:00.534
while they ferried it
all into their holds.

15:00.536 --> 15:04.455
Watched that gold disappear
from that beach piece by piece,

15:04.457 --> 15:06.624
and watched them weigh
anchor and set sail.

15:06.626 --> 15:09.793
When it was all clear,
we walked the beach.

15:09.795 --> 15:11.795
Not a fucking piece left behind.

15:11.797 --> 15:14.632
Not a fucking piece.

15:14.634 --> 15:16.350
Thank you.

15:26.312 --> 15:28.279
What's happening out there?

15:28.281 --> 15:31.282
They've called council to
debate how they wish to proceed.

15:31.284 --> 15:32.950
That should be productive.

15:32.952 --> 15:35.452
DUFRESNE: The good news for you
is Hornigold's support

15:35.454 --> 15:37.454
has disappeared completely.

15:37.456 --> 15:39.957
There's not a soul among
them that has any appetite

15:39.959 --> 15:41.792
for fighting over the fort tonight.

15:41.794 --> 15:44.628
Without the gold,
it all seems rather pointless.

15:44.630 --> 15:48.132
- And the bad news?
- It's chaos out there.

15:48.134 --> 15:50.801
Likely to be for some time.

15:50.803 --> 15:55.055
There are as many proposals for
what ought to be our next score

15:55.057 --> 15:56.724
as there are men to voice them,

15:56.726 --> 15:59.560
including ransoming that
hostage girl of yours

15:59.562 --> 16:01.845
for cash instead of favors.

16:01.847 --> 16:04.148
If she's ever delivered to us.

16:05.768 --> 16:08.769
One way or the other,
those men want to get paid.

16:08.771 --> 16:10.154
And soon.

16:11.774 --> 16:14.675
May we have the room, please?

16:21.784 --> 16:24.118
What a fucking mess.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.121
We have to think very carefully

16:27.123 --> 16:30.791
about how to navigate these next steps.

16:30.793 --> 16:32.960
The case for returning
the girl to Charles Town

16:32.962 --> 16:36.130
in exchange for reconciliation
cannot come from me.

16:36.132 --> 16:38.465
I've just had my authority challenged.

16:38.467 --> 16:41.468
Even on it's merits,
the argument would seem desperate

16:41.470 --> 16:44.471
and invite doubt and suspicion.

16:44.473 --> 16:48.309
But if it came from you,
we might just stand a chance...

16:48.311 --> 16:50.477
SILVER:
Let me stop you right there.

16:50.479 --> 16:53.147
There is no "we."

16:53.149 --> 16:56.033
We stopped being a thing of any
relevance about an hour ago.

16:56.035 --> 16:57.868
Is that so?

16:57.870 --> 17:01.205
I believe I've been clear about
the nature of my investment here.

17:01.207 --> 17:03.991
The gold was the inducement.

17:03.993 --> 17:06.827
- Now no gold...
- It's an unfortunate development

17:06.829 --> 17:08.796
that we have to adapt, and quickly.

17:08.798 --> 17:12.132
Adapt? I've had about my
fill of adapting lately.

17:12.134 --> 17:14.468
Doing your bidding,
keeping the crew in line for you.

17:14.470 --> 17:16.303
I wasn't the only one
to benefit from that.

17:16.305 --> 17:18.305
It certainly seemed that way.

17:18.307 --> 17:20.473
Even now you're the only
one benefitting from it.

17:20.476 --> 17:23.143
What are you saying,
that I'm benefitting

17:23.145 --> 17:24.811
from the gold having disappeared?

17:24.814 --> 17:27.513
It certainly solved a number
of problems for you, didn't it?

17:29.031 --> 17:31.151
I have half a mind to wonder
if you didn't orchestrate

17:31.153 --> 17:33.487
this whole thing to your advantage.

17:33.489 --> 17:35.989
Listen to me.

17:35.991 --> 17:38.492
I understand your disappointment
at this recent news.

17:38.494 --> 17:40.611
I share it.

17:40.613 --> 17:42.780
But I need your help.

17:42.782 --> 17:45.616
- They need your help.
- Oh, please.

17:45.618 --> 17:48.285
Don't try to convince me to do it
for the sake of their futures.

17:48.287 --> 17:49.670
For the sake of your own.

17:51.457 --> 17:54.875
Those men listen to you. They give
a shit about what you have to say.

17:54.877 --> 17:57.211
What you think,
what you want them to think.

17:57.213 --> 18:00.381
Where else in the world is that true?

18:00.383 --> 18:03.384
Where else would you wake up
in the morning and matter?

18:05.304 --> 18:09.022
You walk out on this,
and where the fuck are you going?

18:15.781 --> 18:17.981
You'll address the men?

18:20.286 --> 18:21.618
Yeah.

18:21.620 --> 18:24.121
Many of them won't want to hear it.

18:24.123 --> 18:26.990
Don't you want to discuss
how you'll approach them?

18:30.963 --> 18:33.497
I know what I'm doing.

18:37.303 --> 18:40.337
(Men chatting)

18:43.642 --> 18:44.975
(Thuds)

18:44.977 --> 18:46.844
(Chatter stops)

18:51.267 --> 18:53.567
Some fuckin' day, huh?

18:57.523 --> 19:01.358
I'm sure you idiots had half
that money spent already.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.445
What were you gone do with it?

19:04.447 --> 19:06.280
- SILVER: Me?
- Mm.

19:06.282 --> 19:09.450
I was gone walk away from all
you people and never look back.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.785
(Scattered laughter)

19:11.787 --> 19:14.288
I mean it. That money was license

19:14.290 --> 19:16.623
for me to leave all of this

19:16.625 --> 19:19.960
and all of you behind.

19:19.962 --> 19:22.963
And any one of you who says he didn't
at least consider doing the same

19:22.965 --> 19:25.466
is a lying sack of shit.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.801
Truth is,
there's only one kind of person

19:27.803 --> 19:32.139
who'd want to do what we do
if there was an easier way to survive.

19:32.141 --> 19:36.643
And because I don't believe there is
a rotten, murdering fuck amongst you,

19:36.645 --> 19:39.813
I don't imagine I'm alone
in having taken some comfort

19:39.815 --> 19:42.816
in the idea of all of
this coming to an end.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.156
But now...

19:49.158 --> 19:50.657
no gold.

19:53.662 --> 19:57.631
We're back to the same two choices
we've known our entire lives...

19:57.633 --> 20:00.968
toil for another man's benefit

20:00.970 --> 20:03.837
or steal for our own.

20:07.309 --> 20:09.009
Unless...

20:10.980 --> 20:14.014
Captain Flint just
showed us a third way.

20:17.820 --> 20:19.186
Reconciliation.

20:22.658 --> 20:24.658
Pardons.

20:24.660 --> 20:27.995
And not because we need to
apologize for what we've done.

20:29.615 --> 20:32.833
Not because we got any desire to
go back to where we came from.

20:34.954 --> 20:38.121
But because maybe...

20:38.123 --> 20:40.958
with a little help...

20:40.960 --> 20:44.511
this place could be the reason
we never have to do either again.

20:47.967 --> 20:49.967
The question then becomes

20:49.969 --> 20:53.136
what do we have to lose?

20:53.138 --> 20:55.375
Truly amazing.

20:57.059 --> 20:58.892
With that one and the captain aligned,

20:58.894 --> 21:00.694
there would seem to be no
limits to their ability

21:00.696 --> 21:03.063
to manipulate sentiment among the men.

21:06.118 --> 21:10.120
Perhaps the men are swayed
by the strength of the argument.

21:10.122 --> 21:14.458
A political alliance with the most
dogged pirate hunter in the New World?

21:14.460 --> 21:16.994
Because once they were friends?

21:18.964 --> 21:22.332
I think it's clear what
needs to happen next, Billy.

21:27.139 --> 21:29.306
So easy for you to betray your oath?

21:29.308 --> 21:32.509
I'm aware of my oath.

21:34.480 --> 21:38.599
Those men are my brothers,
same as yours.

21:38.601 --> 21:41.768
But because they would
march blindly to their end,

21:41.770 --> 21:44.771
does that mean we must as well?

21:44.773 --> 21:49.109
If you and I know we have the opportunity
to save eight of them from that fate,

21:49.111 --> 21:51.612
give eight of them a real future,

21:51.614 --> 21:54.698
and we can actually deliver,

21:54.700 --> 21:57.868
doesn't our oath compel us to do so?

21:57.870 --> 22:01.088
Are those eight men not
our brothers as well?

22:05.794 --> 22:09.630
Do you think you could find eight men
that would see things the same way?

22:09.632 --> 22:12.466
I do.

22:12.468 --> 22:17.137
Men who would be willing
to betray the captain,

22:17.139 --> 22:19.306
assist us in subduing him,

22:19.308 --> 22:22.476
and deliver him to the Navy by force?

22:24.647 --> 22:27.147
I do.

22:33.155 --> 22:35.989
Then find them.

22:35.991 --> 22:38.158
We'll meet at the bluffs in an hour,

22:38.160 --> 22:39.993
then we move.

23:16.448 --> 23:19.332
(People chatting, laughing)

23:44.476 --> 23:46.359
Sit.

23:51.784 --> 23:54.901
(Speaking French)

24:00.542 --> 24:03.043
I have some business to attend to.

24:03.045 --> 24:04.628
Eat.

24:04.630 --> 24:07.664
When I return,
you and I will discuss the road ahead.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.982
MAN:
It's better on Wednesdays.

24:36.779 --> 24:38.945
Alice gets the leavings
from the tavern on Tuesdays,

24:38.947 --> 24:41.665
so on Wednesdays, it is a bisque.

24:43.118 --> 24:46.670
Friday, it's more of a stew.

24:47.956 --> 24:49.790
And Saturday... I'm not even sure Alice

24:49.792 --> 24:52.125
knows what to call that
for her Saturday's.

24:52.127 --> 24:54.377
Don't you know who I am?

24:54.379 --> 24:57.047
No, why? You famous?

24:58.684 --> 25:01.685
- No.
- Me, either.

25:01.687 --> 25:03.637
Though I am working on it.

25:05.808 --> 25:09.810
Jacob Garret,
carpenter's mate with the Intrepid.

25:13.148 --> 25:15.482
So you don't want to tell me your name?

25:17.319 --> 25:19.820
All right, suit yourself.

25:19.822 --> 25:23.156
Yeah, a couple of the guys
and I are working on a plan

25:23.158 --> 25:26.159
to split off and start our own crew.

25:26.161 --> 25:27.961
Now, I only tell you this
so when you start hearing

25:27.963 --> 25:29.462
Captain Jacob Garret stories,

25:29.464 --> 25:31.298
you'll be able to put a face to a name.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.801
Jesus Christ, Jacob.
She don't need your life story.

25:34.803 --> 25:37.971
Take her upstairs, fuck her already.

25:37.973 --> 25:40.507
We ain't got all night.

25:42.311 --> 25:44.978
If it makes you feel any better,
Captain Jacob Garret

25:44.980 --> 25:47.180
would never have a man
like that on his crew.

25:52.988 --> 25:55.405
Why me?

25:56.358 --> 25:58.191
Because you're new.

25:58.193 --> 26:00.243
And you seem nice.

26:02.698 --> 26:03.997
What do you think?

26:41.119 --> 26:43.620
(Groans)

26:43.622 --> 26:45.488
So, aren't you gonna tell me the rules?

26:48.293 --> 26:49.826
No?

26:51.323 --> 26:52.963
You're supposed to
tell me what's allowed.

26:52.965 --> 26:54.381
I tell you what I want.

26:54.383 --> 26:57.550
You tell me how much it costs.

26:57.552 --> 27:00.887
No? All right. Not a problem.

27:00.889 --> 27:02.889
Well, why don't we...

27:02.891 --> 27:04.975
look, all right,

27:04.977 --> 27:07.310
usually the girls would
charge me five pieces...

27:07.312 --> 27:09.145
(Jacob's voice fades)

27:10.599 --> 27:14.818
I'm thoroughly boring, not into any
of the weird or controversial stuff.

27:19.274 --> 27:21.107
What do you think?

27:21.109 --> 27:23.994
Does that sound fair to you?

27:49.304 --> 27:52.138
IDELLE:
Are you kidding me?

27:52.140 --> 27:55.859
You can't do this.
I'm sorry, she's new.

27:55.861 --> 27:58.862
Left another man downstairs under the
impression he was her guest for the night.

27:58.864 --> 28:01.031
Look, I wasn't trying to
make any trouble, all right?

28:01.033 --> 28:03.400
This is her fault, not yours.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.820
In fact,

28:06.822 --> 28:09.322
the management would like
me to make it up to you.

28:11.159 --> 28:14.327
On account of the confusion.

28:17.466 --> 28:19.833
(Laughs)

29:48.140 --> 29:50.807
I'm sorry, ma'am, but may I ask,

29:50.809 --> 29:53.143
how did you arrive in this place?

29:53.145 --> 29:56.096
My father brought me
here when I was a child.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.098
Was he one of them?

29:58.100 --> 30:00.650
(Chuckles) No, he was most assuredly
not one of them.

30:02.437 --> 30:04.604
I remember when my father

30:04.606 --> 30:06.990
told me he was leaving for Carolina.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.276
He left me behind.

30:10.278 --> 30:13.947
He said Charles Town was far
too coarse and violent a place

30:13.949 --> 30:15.498
to bring a child into.

30:17.953 --> 30:20.286
But you seem a formidable woman, ma'am.

30:20.288 --> 30:23.123
Perhaps it was exposure to
the challenges of this place

30:23.125 --> 30:25.508
that made you the person you are.

30:28.130 --> 30:30.296
I suppose that's one way to look at it.

30:56.374 --> 30:58.074
(Grunts)

31:03.331 --> 31:07.167
(Grunting)

31:08.637 --> 31:10.837
(Panting)

31:19.814 --> 31:21.814
We staggered our departures from camp

31:21.816 --> 31:23.816
so as not to arouse suspicion.

31:23.818 --> 31:25.852
Did you secure the skiff?

31:27.989 --> 31:31.191
Billy, someone's coming.

31:41.786 --> 31:44.504
What is this?

31:46.791 --> 31:49.125
Have you ever been tortured?

31:49.127 --> 31:50.960
What?

31:50.962 --> 31:54.047
Suffered pain applied by men

31:54.049 --> 31:56.382
who saw you as less than a man?

31:56.384 --> 31:58.551
Saw you as an animal?

32:00.889 --> 32:03.389
'Cause it isn't actually
the pain they're inflicting

32:03.391 --> 32:04.807
that's the most frightening part of it.

32:04.809 --> 32:08.111
It isn't the fear of future pain.

32:08.113 --> 32:11.114
It's the knowledge

32:11.116 --> 32:13.283
that even when the pain stops,

32:13.285 --> 32:16.452
even if they were to let you go,

32:16.454 --> 32:18.154
that they've changed you.

32:20.792 --> 32:24.294
That pain, that fear,

32:24.296 --> 32:26.496
that despair...

32:28.466 --> 32:30.967
has made you someone else,

32:30.969 --> 32:34.470
someone you barely recognize.

32:34.472 --> 32:36.339
Against your will.

32:39.644 --> 32:43.596
I said what I had to say
to get out of that place,

32:43.598 --> 32:47.150
but I have no intention
of honoring their offer.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.573
10 pardons.

32:57.028 --> 33:00.363
I would fight to the death
to ensure not a single one

33:00.365 --> 33:03.499
of my brothers ever has
to face what I faced.

33:05.620 --> 33:07.954
Now, if there's a man on this
crew that feels differently,

33:07.956 --> 33:09.455
that feels as though he'd be willing

33:09.457 --> 33:12.125
to accept another brother
suffering that fate

33:12.127 --> 33:15.461
so that he might avoid it,

33:15.463 --> 33:18.464
then that's a man I need
to remove from my crew.

33:20.802 --> 33:23.970
Right now, Mr. Dufresne here
has identified you men

33:23.972 --> 33:26.806
as the most likely to
represent such a problem.

33:29.144 --> 33:30.810
Was he right?

33:30.812 --> 33:32.979
MAN: Don't appreciate
being fucked with, Billy.

33:32.981 --> 33:35.982
If you ain't got the balls to
stand up to Flint, maybe you...

33:38.320 --> 33:39.819
(Grunts)

33:44.326 --> 33:46.159
(Coughs)

33:46.161 --> 33:47.994
(Man groans)

33:53.835 --> 33:57.553
There will be no more dissent
against Captain Flint.

33:59.841 --> 34:03.176
There will be no
subversion of his plans.

34:03.178 --> 34:05.645
There will be nothing but adherence

34:05.647 --> 34:09.649
to the principal that
we are none of us safe

34:09.650 --> 34:12.851
until we are all safe.

34:15.156 --> 34:18.524
Does anyone have a problem with that?

34:23.281 --> 34:25.164
Then be on your way.

34:39.464 --> 34:41.013
(Door clanging)

34:43.635 --> 34:45.635
Fuck!

34:45.637 --> 34:46.969
Is there another way around?

34:46.971 --> 34:49.639
Not without going back
through the courtyard.

34:49.641 --> 34:51.641
And if they haven't checked
your cell yet, they will soon.

34:51.643 --> 34:52.975
When they see that you've gone,

34:52.976 --> 34:54.694
they'll search every inch
of this fort until they...

34:54.696 --> 34:56.562
- (Distant clang)
- (Gasps)

35:01.703 --> 35:04.153
(Clanging)

35:08.126 --> 35:09.325
They're coming.

35:10.962 --> 35:13.830
Oh, God.
(Panting)

35:20.805 --> 35:24.006
(Grunting)

35:28.930 --> 35:31.814
- (Creaking)
- (Grunting)

35:45.613 --> 35:47.663
(Groaning)

35:55.540 --> 35:57.423
Let me help.

36:04.466 --> 36:06.132
Now go.

36:08.303 --> 36:09.802
Here, take this.

36:13.975 --> 36:17.477
(Creaking)

36:19.814 --> 36:21.981
(Footsteps approaching)

36:32.827 --> 36:35.127
(Lock clicks)

36:35.129 --> 36:37.830
(Gasps)

36:52.313 --> 36:55.348
- VANE: I saved your life.
- (Abigail whimpers)

36:55.350 --> 36:59.352
I killed him for you.

36:59.354 --> 37:01.521
Low and his crew.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.990
I killed them all to protect you.

37:03.992 --> 37:06.692
You didn't do it for me.

37:08.446 --> 37:11.831
You will turn on absolutely anyone,
won't you?

37:13.785 --> 37:15.952
So what's the plan?

37:15.954 --> 37:18.955
Leave me to answer for
this among the men?

37:18.957 --> 37:20.790
Assume they'll tear me to pieces

37:20.792 --> 37:23.125
for granting access to the woman

37:23.127 --> 37:26.128
who stole the girl out from under us?

37:26.130 --> 37:28.464
My death sentence?

37:28.466 --> 37:31.017
Listen to me clearly.

37:33.137 --> 37:37.139
Put down that key,
walk back through that gate,

37:37.141 --> 37:39.475
return the girl,

37:39.477 --> 37:42.278
and I will sort this with the men.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.947
You have my word.

37:44.949 --> 37:47.116
But lock that gate

37:47.118 --> 37:51.153
and there is no walking back
through it, ever.

37:53.875 --> 37:55.708
And I assure you,

37:55.710 --> 37:58.744
you will hear from me again.

38:11.142 --> 38:13.175
(Lock clicks)

38:42.790 --> 38:44.790
MAX:
I know how you feel.

38:44.792 --> 38:48.461
Not that long ago, I was lost.

38:48.463 --> 38:50.129
Without friends.

38:50.131 --> 38:52.798
Without identity.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.351
I thought there was no life
for me that I understood

38:55.353 --> 38:59.522
and I felt as though that
meant there was no life at all.

38:59.524 --> 39:01.357
But I was wrong.

39:01.359 --> 39:04.143
Especially in this place.

39:04.145 --> 39:06.312
There is always a life,

39:06.314 --> 39:09.315
there is always a future,

39:09.317 --> 39:12.818
as long as one is willing
to build it for themselves.

39:14.155 --> 39:15.988
Now, though,
I am beginning to understand

39:15.990 --> 39:18.491
there are limits to what
one can build alone.

39:20.161 --> 39:24.630
I can only scavenge leads
generated by Eleanor for so long.

39:24.632 --> 39:26.966
I have an appetite for
something larger than that,

39:26.968 --> 39:29.335
and it requires expanding.

39:31.472 --> 39:33.305
Proper spies.

39:33.307 --> 39:36.475
Perhaps off the island as well.

39:36.477 --> 39:39.145
For this, I need a partner
with knowledge of the sea

39:39.147 --> 39:41.514
and I need a partner I can trust.

39:53.494 --> 39:56.112
No word?

39:56.114 --> 39:57.496
No, no word.

40:00.118 --> 40:04.120
If Eleanor says she'll come
down that hill with Abigail,

40:04.122 --> 40:06.122
she will.

40:06.124 --> 40:08.624
I understand that once
the girl is delivered

40:08.626 --> 40:11.794
and Captain Flint's set sail
to return her to Charles Town

40:11.796 --> 40:14.296
that you intend to join
them for the voyage.

40:14.298 --> 40:16.966
Is that true?

40:16.968 --> 40:20.803
With all due respect, Mr. Guthrie,

40:20.805 --> 40:22.805
what concern is it of yours?

40:22.807 --> 40:26.976
Charles Town, ma'am, is not London.

40:26.978 --> 40:29.445
It may appear to you to
be a civilized place,

40:29.447 --> 40:33.616
but rest assured,
it only appears that way.

40:33.618 --> 40:37.787
Governor Ashe and his militia
are men of the most brutal kind

40:37.789 --> 40:40.322
when it comes to
enforcement of the laws.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.316
Hello, Abigail.

41:10.271 --> 41:13.322
I'm Miranda Hamilton.
Do you remember me?

41:18.112 --> 41:20.329
(Sobbing)

41:42.303 --> 41:44.970
(Door opens)

42:54.375 --> 42:56.876
I don't suppose
you'd mind sharing that bottle?

42:59.881 --> 43:03.632
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to be alone.

43:03.634 --> 43:06.802
Shame.

43:06.804 --> 43:10.189
Because there is something
we really ought to discuss.

43:11.475 --> 43:13.976
If this is about Charlotte
and Mr. Logan, I assure you...

43:13.978 --> 43:16.979
I heard on the beach
they're in Providence.

43:18.950 --> 43:20.983
Why, did you hear something different?

43:22.787 --> 43:25.154
Then what is it you wish to discuss?

43:28.292 --> 43:30.492
Best we do this in private.

43:32.964 --> 43:35.664
(Waves lapping)

43:46.477 --> 43:47.977
BILLY:
Can I have a word?

43:52.099 --> 43:54.066
Of course.

43:57.188 --> 43:59.188
I'm waiting on a final tally,

43:59.190 --> 44:03.242
but I believe we've lost around
18 defectors over the last few hours.

44:06.948 --> 44:08.781
Some due to loss of the gold,

44:08.783 --> 44:11.951
some following Hornigold out
the door out of loyalty to him.

44:11.953 --> 44:14.286
Anyone we'll miss?

44:14.288 --> 44:15.955
Mr. Dufresne.

44:15.957 --> 44:17.790
Really?

44:17.792 --> 44:20.292
He saw the crew's
overwhelming support for you,

44:20.294 --> 44:22.628
felt his resentment towards
you had become an impediment

44:22.630 --> 44:24.630
in his existing amongst them.

44:24.632 --> 44:28.300
So we are without a quartermaster.

44:28.302 --> 44:31.971
For the moment.
We should take care to steer the men

44:31.973 --> 44:34.139
towards a replacement
from Hornigold's men.

44:34.141 --> 44:36.141
Someone to fold the two crews together

44:36.143 --> 44:38.978
but not someone who's gone offer
you any personal resistance.

44:38.980 --> 44:41.480
I was thinking Mr. Scott
might be an ideal candidate.

44:41.482 --> 44:44.817
Billy, I don't mean to be blunt,
but what the fuck are you doing?

44:45.987 --> 44:47.653
Why am I supporting your captaincy?

44:47.655 --> 44:49.321
Yes.

44:50.825 --> 44:54.376
When I went into the water that night

44:54.378 --> 44:56.495
after Andromache,

44:56.497 --> 45:01.166
I remember losing my
footing on the bowsprit.

45:01.168 --> 45:03.469
I remember as I was falling,

45:03.471 --> 45:07.473
reaching out, grasping your hand.

45:07.475 --> 45:10.809
And the last thing I remember
before I went into the water

45:10.811 --> 45:13.312
was feeling it slip away.

45:13.314 --> 45:17.483
Now, I told the men
you tried to save me.

45:17.485 --> 45:19.651
But the truth is

45:19.653 --> 45:23.822
it's just as likely you let go

45:23.824 --> 45:26.492
and dropped me into the sea.

45:26.494 --> 45:29.278
Which do you think it was?

45:29.280 --> 45:32.781
Doesn't much matter,
as far as I can tell.

45:32.783 --> 45:35.284
I'll likely never know for certain.

45:35.286 --> 45:38.287
It's possible you'll never
even know for certain.

45:38.289 --> 45:40.789
And right now, I'm more focused

45:40.791 --> 45:44.126
on what comes next than what's passed.

45:44.128 --> 45:47.629
I believe you were right.

45:47.631 --> 45:49.798
I believe that for what comes next,

45:49.800 --> 45:53.135
the men of this crew will
need your leadership.

45:53.137 --> 45:55.220
So I will do what needs to be done

45:55.222 --> 45:57.556
to preserve it and protect it.

45:57.558 --> 46:01.026
Mr. Gates turned his back on you.

46:01.028 --> 46:04.446
Don't think for a second
I'll make the same mistake he did.

46:04.448 --> 46:08.951
- MULDOON: Captain?
- Yes?

46:08.953 --> 46:11.987
Word from the tavern.
Miss Guthrie's asked for you.

46:52.613 --> 46:55.414
Why don't you introduce yourself?

47:14.969 --> 47:16.969
Don't be frightened.

47:19.807 --> 47:21.807
I'm a friend of your family's.

47:23.477 --> 47:26.311
And I'm a friend of yours.

47:30.651 --> 47:32.484
You're Captain Flint?

47:32.486 --> 47:35.320
My name is James.

47:38.492 --> 47:40.826
James McGraw.

47:53.140 --> 47:55.224
Where are you headed?

47:57.178 --> 48:00.345
That's a very good question.

48:00.347 --> 48:04.149
I'm far too recognizable
for the English colonies.

48:04.151 --> 48:06.985
I'd spend the rest of my days
looking over my shoulder.

48:06.987 --> 48:09.154
It's shameful...

48:09.156 --> 48:12.658
for a man who's defended
this place for so long.

48:12.660 --> 48:14.159
Cast aside by it.

48:14.161 --> 48:16.612
Perhaps it has cast me aside.

48:16.614 --> 48:19.615
Or perhaps it's just taken me this long

48:19.617 --> 48:22.501
to realize this place has
been dying for a long time.

48:23.954 --> 48:26.788
I may be an old man, but I see no reason

48:26.790 --> 48:29.958
to allow it to drag me into my grave.

48:29.960 --> 48:32.628
What if you didn't have to go anywhere?

48:32.630 --> 48:34.630
Oh, England will have
her island back, son.

48:34.632 --> 48:37.966
The day that happens,
it'll be a bad day to be a pirate here.

48:37.968 --> 48:40.802
Unless we had something to offer them

48:40.804 --> 48:44.139
that might change their
thinking about us.

48:44.141 --> 48:45.807
You think there's
something valuable enough

48:45.809 --> 48:48.477
to make the British Navy forget
that you and I are pirates?

48:50.281 --> 48:53.699
And what do you think would
have that kind of value to them?

48:53.701 --> 48:55.701
Not what.

48:55.703 --> 48:57.569
Who.

49:02.876 --> 49:05.627
How soon before you can sail?

49:05.629 --> 49:08.497
First light. No need to delay.

49:10.060 --> 49:12.301
My father has left for the
interior to lay the groundwork

49:12.303 --> 49:14.803
with Mr. Underhill for the partnership.

49:14.805 --> 49:17.639
With any luck, by the time you return,

49:17.641 --> 49:20.926
you and Governor Ashe will be
greeted by a group of handsome men,

49:20.928 --> 49:24.763
pretty wives, and rosy-cheeked children.

49:24.765 --> 49:27.432
Lawful citizens of
New Providence Island,

49:27.434 --> 49:30.269
who, after decades of struggle,
have finally have found a way

49:30.271 --> 49:32.988
to sell their sugarcane
to honest markets.

49:35.109 --> 49:38.277
You know, if you and I aren't careful,

49:38.279 --> 49:40.829
we might actually see
this thing through.

49:45.619 --> 49:47.452
I took her.

49:47.454 --> 49:49.338
Without his consent.

49:51.292 --> 49:52.958
You know that, don't you?

49:52.960 --> 49:55.127
I had the thought.

49:57.131 --> 50:00.632
His men warned him not to trust me.

50:00.634 --> 50:03.302
They told him that I
would betray them all.

50:06.974 --> 50:09.141
Do you think there's any
chance he'll survive this?

50:17.318 --> 50:19.651
The things I have destroyed
to reach this moment...

50:21.322 --> 50:24.489
everything and anything
that stood in it's way.

50:24.491 --> 50:29.127
And for all that effort,
for all that sacrifice,

50:29.129 --> 50:32.664
it is now entirely reliant upon you.

50:34.301 --> 50:36.635
SILVER:
Trust is a funny thing.

50:36.637 --> 50:38.970
When I pledged my
support to Captain Flint,

50:38.972 --> 50:42.140
I believed the trust between
us to be of the strongest kind.

50:42.142 --> 50:45.477
We both desperately
wanted the same thing.

50:45.479 --> 50:48.146
And that makes for good partners.

50:48.148 --> 50:50.482
But over the past few days,
it's become clear to me

50:50.484 --> 50:51.983
that the prize we both wanted

50:51.985 --> 50:55.737
is becoming less a prize to
him and more an obstacle.

50:57.191 --> 50:59.358
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

50:59.360 --> 51:01.860
The Urca gold.

51:01.862 --> 51:04.279
I have feared for days that Flint

51:04.281 --> 51:06.782
might not want that
gold to ever be found,

51:06.784 --> 51:10.452
that it would interfere with plans
he held more important than gold,

51:10.454 --> 51:12.120
more important than wealth.

51:12.122 --> 51:15.841
And I have felt the ground
rushing towards us ever since.

51:17.127 --> 51:19.294
And my greatest fear has
been that in the moment

51:19.296 --> 51:22.464
he decided to end the
hunt for the Urca gold,

51:22.466 --> 51:26.685
the moment he decided it was in
his interest to betray my trust...

51:27.971 --> 51:30.639
that he would find a way to do so

51:30.641 --> 51:32.474
by deception, by force,

51:32.476 --> 51:34.476
by who the fuck knows how.

51:34.478 --> 51:38.780
But what I do know is that he would
ask my help to make it happen.

51:38.782 --> 51:43.118
And by that point,
the gold would be as good as gone.

51:43.120 --> 51:47.289
Any resistance I offered would be futile

51:47.291 --> 51:49.124
and I would be just another tool

51:49.126 --> 51:52.461
that he'd used and then
promptly discarded.

51:52.463 --> 51:55.414
Why are you telling me this?

52:04.308 --> 52:07.476
A few hours ago, a launch arrived.

52:09.430 --> 52:12.264
Two of our men who were
scouting the Urca gold

52:12.266 --> 52:15.267
were returning to the island
against their instructions.

52:15.269 --> 52:18.270
You see, they had been told
very clearly by Captain Flint

52:18.272 --> 52:20.939
to remain with the Urca until we arrived

52:20.941 --> 52:25.110
to help us prepare our assault
on the Spanish beach.

52:25.112 --> 52:28.280
So the moment I saw them approaching,

52:28.282 --> 52:31.783
my first thought was that the only
reason they'd be returning early

52:31.785 --> 52:34.953
was if the gold was no longer there.

52:34.955 --> 52:37.172
And I thought, "My God...

52:38.792 --> 52:40.792
did Flint do this?

52:42.129 --> 52:46.131
Through some kind of luck
or guile or fucking sorcery,

52:46.133 --> 52:47.966
did he reach across an ocean

52:47.968 --> 52:51.636
and make $5 million in gold vanish?"

52:53.307 --> 52:55.524
And sure enough,
just a few minutes later,

52:55.526 --> 52:57.359
those scouts were standing
in front of Captain Flint

52:57.361 --> 52:59.861
reporting to him the gold was gone,

52:59.863 --> 53:02.714
on its way back to Spain.

53:02.716 --> 53:06.818
They told Flint the gold was gone.

53:06.820 --> 53:09.321
Yes.

53:09.323 --> 53:11.323
What did they tell you?

53:13.827 --> 53:15.460
The two scouts reported to me

53:15.462 --> 53:18.129
what they had observed on the beach,

53:18.131 --> 53:21.132
what had driven them to leave
their post ahead of schedule

53:21.134 --> 53:24.836
and return to Nassau
with the utmost haste.

53:34.982 --> 53:39.017
That a tropical disease had
befallen the Spanish camp.

53:39.987 --> 53:41.987
Dozens dead or dying.

53:41.989 --> 53:44.356
Many more suffering, weakened.

53:46.493 --> 53:50.829
Only a handful of men defending it,
most barely even able to stand.

53:55.869 --> 53:58.870
The Urca gold is on that beach

53:58.872 --> 54:02.541
exactly where we left it.

54:02.543 --> 54:05.627
And owing to a most
fortuitous act of God,

54:05.629 --> 54:09.347
it is almost entirely undefended.

54:11.468 --> 54:14.970
So I offered those two scouts a deal
they simply could not reject.

54:14.972 --> 54:18.139
Help me tell a very simple lie,

54:18.141 --> 54:22.110
I will employ a smaller
crew to retrieve the gold,

54:22.112 --> 54:24.613
and our three shares

54:24.615 --> 54:27.148
increase five-fold.

54:29.620 --> 54:33.288
So, do you know of a crew

54:33.290 --> 54:35.490
who might be willing to
aid in this endeavor?

54:50.807 --> 54:52.807
(Horses whinnies)

55:03.020 --> 55:04.986
Go have a look.

55:48.982 --> 55:51.149
(Horse whinnies)

55:56.156 --> 55:59.424
