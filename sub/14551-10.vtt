00:15.240 --> 00:17.029
Previously on Powers...

00:17.030 --> 00:19.029
You know what Sway is? It's Wolfe.

00:19.030 --> 00:21.829
I'm gonna kill him with or without you.

00:21.867 --> 00:24.866
We bust Royalle and drain Wolfe.

00:24.867 --> 00:26.660
That is the plan.

00:26.867 --> 00:27.866
I'm gonna teleport in there with a gun

00:27.867 --> 00:29.702
and shoot him in the fucking head.

00:29.867 --> 00:30.866
How do you arrest a teleporter?

00:30.867 --> 00:32.866
You have to disable him like that.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.866
- Drainer.
- Click, click.

00:34.867 --> 00:37.702
Is that where your friends
have set the trap for me?

00:37.767 --> 00:38.766
There is no trap.

00:38.767 --> 00:39.766
It has to happen fast.

00:39.767 --> 00:41.766
Press the button, green light comes on,

00:41.767 --> 00:42.766
door closes.

00:42.767 --> 00:43.766
Fucking...

00:43.767 --> 00:45.102
Look after Calista.

00:45.394 --> 00:47.766
I need someone I can trust.

00:47.767 --> 00:48.766
Oh, shit, what's...

00:48.767 --> 00:49.766
You killed me.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.767
Kill him!

00:51.977 --> 00:54.766
The world as you know
it is going to end soon.

00:54.767 --> 00:56.686
This is your fault.

00:56.767 --> 00:57.766
I'm a Power.

00:57.767 --> 00:59.018
You push me far enough,

00:59.220 --> 01:01.060
that may be just what
it takes to switch me on.

01:01.677 --> 01:02.676
What the fuck?

01:02.677 --> 01:04.803
Why do you smell like me?

01:48.677 --> 01:49.676
Walker?

01:49.677 --> 01:52.676
Wolfe took out Shaft control.

01:52.677 --> 01:53.676
Get remote communications up.

01:53.677 --> 01:55.676
Make sure Metro and CHP know that

01:55.677 --> 01:57.677
Powers Division is running the grid.

01:59.677 --> 02:01.676
Full lockdown!

02:01.677 --> 02:04.677
Nothing moves in there.

02:12.677 --> 02:14.387
How strong is he? How much has he fed?

02:14.677 --> 02:16.676
He's not interested in eating people.

02:16.677 --> 02:19.676
He can kill and absorb the
powers of anybody who took Sway.

02:19.677 --> 02:20.676
The Kidz.

02:20.677 --> 02:23.429
How many Kidz took Sway?

02:23.677 --> 02:25.676
At least 100, probably more.

02:25.677 --> 02:26.837
If he gets that much power...

02:27.012 --> 02:28.677
Black Swan.

02:30.677 --> 02:31.676
We have got to stop him

02:31.677 --> 02:33.470
before he finds those Kidz.

02:33.677 --> 02:36.676
If I can get close enough to
him, I can absorb his powers...

02:36.677 --> 02:38.676
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

02:38.677 --> 02:40.676
It would have been a hell of a lot easier

02:40.677 --> 02:43.676
if he was still locked up in his cell.

02:43.677 --> 02:44.677
I cannot believe after
everything that has happened

02:44.803 --> 02:46.637
you are still stuck on that.

02:46.677 --> 02:47.676
You're gonna lay this at my feet?

02:47.677 --> 02:49.676
For once in your life, just
stick to the fucking plan.

02:49.677 --> 02:50.677
If you had trusted me,

02:50.845 --> 02:53.677
I would have Wolfe's powers
and he would be harmless.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.676
How could we have trusted you?

02:55.677 --> 02:56.676
How can we trust you now?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.677
Because I'm the only one who can do it.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.676
What are the other options?

03:00.677 --> 03:03.179
I have two working Drainer prototypes.

03:03.429 --> 03:04.676
A one-shot pulse.

03:04.677 --> 03:06.676
And a Drainer pod to bring him back here.

03:06.677 --> 03:07.677
No.

03:09.345 --> 03:11.676
You cannot bring him back here.

03:11.677 --> 03:13.677
- Not this time.
- He's right.

03:17.803 --> 03:20.676
The Drainer pulse isn't
strong enough to take him out,

03:20.677 --> 03:23.676
but it should disable him long
enough for us to get an opening.

03:23.677 --> 03:24.676
To do what?

03:24.677 --> 03:26.676
To overload and detonate
the Drainer pod core.

03:26.677 --> 03:27.677
Will that kill him?

03:27.845 --> 03:29.676
Kill him or permanently drain him

03:29.677 --> 03:32.676
and any other Power in
direct contact with the blast.

03:32.677 --> 03:34.676
And if that doesn't take care of it,

03:34.677 --> 03:36.676
then a bullet will finish the job.

03:36.677 --> 03:38.676
Who's gonna get that close?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.676
You, Harley?

03:40.677 --> 03:44.676
He has kicked your ass
every time you've faced him.

03:44.677 --> 03:47.676
Emile, your hands start shaking
whenever you even think about him.

03:47.677 --> 03:49.676
I'll do it.

03:49.677 --> 03:50.676
No.

03:50.677 --> 03:53.676
I am the best shot we have at this.

03:53.677 --> 03:56.676
If Wolfe is hunting Kidz,
he'll head for the Strip.

03:56.677 --> 03:58.845
We seal him off before he gets there.

03:59.137 --> 04:01.676
Triphammer moves in with his pulse weapon

04:01.677 --> 04:04.676
and Powers Division personnel
will overload the pod core.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.677
When he killed Simons, he
effectively absorbed 19 powers.

04:10.677 --> 04:12.676
Wolfe dies tonight.

04:12.677 --> 04:14.470
I'll radio when I have him in my sight.

04:14.677 --> 04:15.957
Track him, Janice, do not engage.

04:19.677 --> 04:20.677
Emile.

04:21.677 --> 04:23.676
Emile.

04:23.677 --> 04:26.676
Emile, you cannot leave me out of this.

04:26.677 --> 04:29.387
I'm not. You will observe from here.

04:29.677 --> 04:30.676
No one knows Wolfe better than you.

04:30.677 --> 04:32.262
You can advise us in the field.

04:32.554 --> 04:33.794
Take it or leave it, Detective.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.677
I need you to stay with
Walker, keep an eye on him.

04:41.677 --> 04:42.676
What did I do?

04:42.677 --> 04:43.677
You're his partner.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.053
Let's go.

04:58.677 --> 05:00.676
Los Angeles is in full lockdown

05:00.677 --> 05:03.676
after Wolfe's escape from the Shaft.

05:03.677 --> 05:07.554
Commander Cross of LA Powers
Division and the Federal Powers Bureau

05:07.677 --> 05:11.012
have issued Category Five
Powers warning protocols.

05:11.304 --> 05:13.676
All Powers with flying capabilities

05:13.677 --> 05:17.429
are asked to report in to
their Power's warning commanders.

05:17.677 --> 05:21.676
We will bring you non-stop,
live, up-to-date coverage

05:21.677 --> 05:24.053
until Wolfe is contained.

05:24.345 --> 05:28.676
Under no circumstances
should any Powers or non-Powers

05:28.677 --> 05:31.677
approach or engage with Wolfe.

05:34.677 --> 05:36.677
We have a sighting.
Wolfe has been sighted.

05:46.677 --> 05:48.677
Get your sight lines now!

05:53.677 --> 05:55.179
What is he doing?

05:55.470 --> 05:57.803
If you're going to make
a move, do it now, Harley.

05:59.677 --> 06:01.676
Why are his eyes closed?

06:01.677 --> 06:04.220
He's looking for a trace of Kidz' power.

06:04.512 --> 06:05.676
Once he has the scent, he'll be gone.

06:05.677 --> 06:08.676
Seal it off, north and south of Figueroa.

06:08.677 --> 06:10.677
Retro Girl, I'm moving into position.

06:12.677 --> 06:15.676
Where are...

06:15.677 --> 06:17.887
Move, move, move. Guys,
he doesn't care about you.

06:18.137 --> 06:19.676
You're nothing to him now.

06:19.677 --> 06:22.677
Prep the Drainer core
and move in behind me.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.470
Don't move until after I fire the pulse.

06:29.677 --> 06:30.797
Stay close to the buildings.

06:53.677 --> 06:55.429
What the fuck?

06:55.677 --> 06:56.676
Shit.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.304
Zora, the young Power

06:59.596 --> 07:02.676
who singlehandedly brought Wolfe
down during his last escape attempt

07:02.677 --> 07:04.677
is confronting Wolfe.

07:05.677 --> 07:06.677
Rematch, motherfucker!

07:18.677 --> 07:20.677
- What do we do?
- Hold here.

07:28.677 --> 07:29.676
She needs help.

07:29.677 --> 07:30.677
Hold here.

07:45.677 --> 07:46.676
Shit.

07:46.677 --> 07:48.676
For fuck's sake, Harley,
get her out of there

07:48.677 --> 07:49.678
We're going in.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.677
Janice, do not engage.

07:55.137 --> 07:56.676
What is he waiting on?

07:56.677 --> 07:57.757
For Wolfe to be distracted.

07:58.677 --> 07:59.677
Feeding.

08:00.677 --> 08:01.677
No, no, no.

08:05.677 --> 08:10.676
You have a Wolfe-shaped
space in your soul.

08:10.677 --> 08:14.676
I carved it out the last
time we danced together.

08:14.677 --> 08:16.677
Be ready to move in behind me.

08:21.677 --> 08:24.677
And I will live in there forever.

08:25.677 --> 08:28.262
Because you can never beat me.

08:28.554 --> 08:29.677
Beat this.

08:32.677 --> 08:33.677
Yes.

08:43.677 --> 08:45.677
Go, go, go, go, go.

08:47.053 --> 08:48.928
Holy shit, the pulse
cannon malfunctioned.

08:49.220 --> 08:50.676
Fuck!

08:50.677 --> 08:53.676
We need medical. Zora
and Triphammer are down.

08:53.677 --> 08:56.676
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

08:56.677 --> 08:57.720
Who's got eyes on Wolfe?

08:57.970 --> 09:00.677
He went into the Metro
tunnel. He's underground.

09:05.677 --> 09:09.676
Can you take your powers

09:09.677 --> 09:12.676
out of him, so we can kill him?

09:12.677 --> 09:13.676
'Cause there's no margin for error left.

09:13.677 --> 09:15.677
Can you really do it?

09:17.677 --> 09:19.677
He's more powerful now, but...

09:19.803 --> 09:21.676
Yeah.

09:21.677 --> 09:23.676
I can do it.

09:23.677 --> 09:26.677
But I need your help. I can't do it alone.

09:27.677 --> 09:28.676
And I need you to trust me.

09:28.677 --> 09:29.845
Okay.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.676
- She's not moving.
- I think she's dead.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.677
That's her paying for
your mom's life, Krispin.

09:41.677 --> 09:44.676
She should be held accountable.

09:44.677 --> 09:46.676
I don't want her to die.

09:46.677 --> 09:48.676
With the information on your mom's laptop,

09:48.677 --> 09:50.676
the whole dirty Powers Industrial

09:50.677 --> 09:54.053
Entertainment Complex
will be held accountable.

09:54.345 --> 09:55.803
Especially Retro Girl.

10:00.677 --> 10:04.095
We are now entering the
second hour of the frantic search

10:04.387 --> 10:06.676
to locate the mass
murderer known as Wolfe.

10:06.677 --> 10:10.676
Since he was last seen
65 minutes ago at the Strip,

10:10.677 --> 10:13.012
we have no new updates
as to his whereabouts.

10:13.304 --> 10:16.676
Authorities also warn
that, given Wolfe's speed,

10:16.677 --> 10:20.676
he could turn up anywhere at any time.

10:20.677 --> 10:24.676
The entire city is
holding its breath tonight

10:24.677 --> 10:27.676
as all our hopes rest on local Powers

10:27.677 --> 10:29.676
and law enforcement officials who,

10:29.677 --> 10:32.676
we pray, will somehow find Wolfe.

10:32.677 --> 10:34.387
Thank you, Delia.

10:34.637 --> 10:38.676
And now here's Melissa with the latest
details from our crisis coverage team.

10:38.677 --> 10:42.676
We're gonna keep you updated on
all further developments on this story.

10:42.677 --> 10:45.676
Meanwhile, our experts
have constructed a time line

10:45.677 --> 10:49.676
that includes a historical account
of all of Wolfe's known crimes.

10:49.677 --> 10:50.677
In a moment...

11:01.470 --> 11:04.512
You have no reason to be afraid of me.

11:04.677 --> 11:06.677
Or anything else, for that matter.

11:11.677 --> 11:15.677
You are something really quite special.

11:21.677 --> 11:25.677
Is there somewhere around here
where we could talk, that's quiet?

11:29.470 --> 11:31.053
We don't even know if Wolfe is inside

11:31.345 --> 11:32.928
the search perimeter at this point.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.637
Series Seven and Backflash have been

11:35.677 --> 11:37.676
searching with broad spectrum vision.

11:37.677 --> 11:39.678
No sign. He must have
gone underground somewhere.

11:39.970 --> 11:42.677
All right, we search the grid,

11:42.845 --> 11:45.676
find the Powerz Kidz, find Wolfe.

11:45.677 --> 11:47.237
- Let's go.
- All right, let's go. Move out.

11:53.677 --> 11:55.304
Hmm.

12:04.345 --> 12:07.677
Feeding time? Gloating time?

12:09.677 --> 12:11.803
Or am I to receive a lobotomy?

12:14.387 --> 12:15.677
We need your help.

12:16.677 --> 12:19.677
Fuck you!

12:20.677 --> 12:22.677
Wolfe is on the loose.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.676
He's gonna go after the Kidz, Johnny.

12:26.677 --> 12:28.677
Let him eat the Kidz.

12:30.596 --> 12:32.677
Let him eat the whole fucking world.

12:34.677 --> 12:37.928
There's not one fucking person on this rock

12:38.220 --> 12:41.677
I give a fucking shit about.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.928
Really?

12:48.677 --> 12:49.677
What about Calista?

12:53.677 --> 12:56.554
He will go after Calista, Johnny.

13:04.887 --> 13:07.677
I know where he'll go.

13:09.677 --> 13:11.345
Can you take us there?

13:12.470 --> 13:14.677
I want Simons.

13:15.677 --> 13:17.677
Wolfe got Simons.

13:21.677 --> 13:22.677
It's true.

13:24.677 --> 13:26.676
I'm sorry.

13:26.677 --> 13:28.676
He got all of him.

13:28.677 --> 13:32.137
Get me out of this fucking thing now.

13:34.012 --> 13:35.677
Now!

13:40.179 --> 13:41.677
I can sign it for you.

13:43.677 --> 13:44.677
You said I'm special.

13:45.677 --> 13:48.676
But you knew that already.

13:48.677 --> 13:51.676
People act like I'm stupid
or crazy when I say it.

13:51.677 --> 13:53.677
When you say...

13:54.220 --> 13:55.676
I'm a Power.

13:55.677 --> 13:56.677
Are you?

13:58.677 --> 14:01.676
There's something missing inside of me.

14:01.677 --> 14:02.677
A hole.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.677
I can feel it there.

14:06.677 --> 14:07.676
I've tried everything to fill it.

14:07.677 --> 14:09.676
Yes.

14:09.677 --> 14:13.304
An emptiness and a deep
hunger to fill that void.

14:13.596 --> 14:14.677
I know how you feel.

14:15.677 --> 14:17.677
Can you help me?

14:19.677 --> 14:21.676
Power is the ability to exert

14:21.677 --> 14:23.676
your will on the world around you.

14:23.677 --> 14:25.803
Anyone who says otherwise
is selling something.

14:27.677 --> 14:29.677
Like maybe a book.

14:33.677 --> 14:34.677
I can help.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.677
If you would like to try.

15:13.677 --> 15:15.677
They're right outside.

15:17.304 --> 15:18.677
Waiting to be plucked.

15:21.677 --> 15:23.677
I am not suggesting this is easy.

15:25.677 --> 15:30.677
But life is a wearying endeavor.

15:32.637 --> 15:33.676
And you have to make a choice.

15:33.677 --> 15:38.676
You have to decide how
much of it you really want.

15:38.677 --> 15:41.677
The little bit that is
rationed to everyone.

15:42.677 --> 15:44.676
Or a heaping bounty

15:44.677 --> 15:48.677
that you must reap for yourself.

15:52.677 --> 15:54.677
You want another taste?

16:04.677 --> 16:08.637
Because there's no one else like
me and that is a lonely feeling,

16:08.677 --> 16:10.676
and we can all feel it.

16:10.677 --> 16:11.957
And the world keeps telling us...

16:12.677 --> 16:13.677
They're still alive.

16:13.845 --> 16:15.262
For now.

16:15.554 --> 16:18.676
I'm calling Cross. Shit.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.676
Powers Division. Give me your phone.

16:20.677 --> 16:22.677
Get the Kidz out of here now.

16:24.012 --> 16:25.676
It's Pilgrim, sir. I'm with Walker.

16:25.677 --> 16:27.676
What the hell?

16:27.677 --> 16:29.717
We have Wolfe in Royalle's
club. We need backup now.

16:30.677 --> 16:34.676
All right, Powers Division.
Closing time, everybody out!

16:34.677 --> 16:36.676
Let's go.

16:36.677 --> 16:39.677
I need you to move it
quickly, people. Thank you.

16:41.677 --> 16:43.309
- Finally.
- Calista.

16:43.317 --> 16:46.970
If you try and touch her,
Johnny... You, too, Christian.

16:47.262 --> 16:51.676
And I'm not half-demented
or bullet-ridden this time.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.676
We're not going to try
anything. Just let her leave.

16:54.677 --> 16:55.957
I don't think she wants to leave.

16:57.677 --> 16:58.677
Do you?

17:00.677 --> 17:05.676
You have misconstrued me entirely.

17:06.345 --> 17:08.675
Always.

17:08.676 --> 17:11.095
You thought I was grooming
you for some great ascension.

17:11.345 --> 17:14.675
And then, when I lost my composure,

17:14.676 --> 17:17.675
you thought I had been
fattening you like cattle.

17:17.676 --> 17:18.676
Wrong!

17:19.676 --> 17:21.675
You wanted a family.

17:21.676 --> 17:22.675
A legacy.

17:22.676 --> 17:25.676
A family that could outlast me.

17:27.676 --> 17:31.677
I never meant to eat them.
They were just so ripe.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.676
Just like them out there.

17:34.677 --> 17:35.677
You can't have them.

17:38.677 --> 17:41.677
I'm not gonna send you to
the Shaft this time, old man.

17:43.677 --> 17:48.677
I going to give you something
that I think you've earned.

17:50.677 --> 17:52.676
A chance to redeem the past.

17:52.677 --> 17:53.717
He's gonna drain the Kidz!

18:00.304 --> 18:01.429
Aah!

18:05.677 --> 18:08.304
We're too late!

18:09.677 --> 18:10.677
We're too late.

18:24.677 --> 18:25.720
My legacy...

18:27.677 --> 18:29.676
The beginning of it, anyway.

18:29.677 --> 18:32.677
I should have done this long ago!

18:33.677 --> 18:35.677
Yes, you should have.

18:35.761 --> 18:37.677
It's too late now.

18:40.677 --> 18:43.676
No! Where the fuck did he take him?

18:43.677 --> 18:45.345
Not far.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.637
Stand back.

18:48.677 --> 18:49.676
Walker, get ready.

18:49.677 --> 18:51.677
Deena, be ready to take the shot.

18:51.803 --> 18:53.677
Okay.

18:56.512 --> 18:57.512
Oh, my God.

19:03.677 --> 19:04.677
Shit!

19:10.677 --> 19:11.677
Do it, Christian!

19:21.677 --> 19:22.677
Not today, Christian.

19:29.970 --> 19:33.676
There's no reason for you
two to see what happens next.

19:33.677 --> 19:35.677
Let me at least spare you that.

20:19.596 --> 20:20.677
Be ready to take the shot.

20:30.677 --> 20:33.677
If you drain me, you drain yourself.

20:35.677 --> 20:36.677
I know.

22:18.677 --> 22:20.677
We're your legacy, old man,

22:52.677 --> 22:54.720
Johnny Royalle has just emerged from

22:54.970 --> 22:56.676
Here and Gone with the head of Wolfe.

22:56.677 --> 22:58.887
In the shocking conclusion
to the night's events,

22:59.137 --> 23:01.676
Wolfe's one-time apostle, Johnny Royalle,

23:01.677 --> 23:03.676
has apparently killed his former master.

23:03.677 --> 23:06.677
Staged for the pleasure
of the ignorant masses.

23:08.677 --> 23:10.179
They killed Wolfe.

23:11.677 --> 23:13.676
So they say.

23:13.677 --> 23:17.803
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

24:42.677 --> 24:45.676
The number of young Powers
who died are not yet confirmed,

24:45.677 --> 24:47.676
but no doubt it would have been greater

24:47.677 --> 24:49.676
had Johnny Royalle not intervened.

24:49.677 --> 24:51.676
Here we go again.

24:51.677 --> 24:54.637
Well, turn it the fuck
off if you don't like it.

24:54.677 --> 24:56.877
Like you're not pissed
Royalle's getting all the credit.

24:57.512 --> 24:58.677
Fuck you.

24:59.677 --> 25:00.677
What's in your ass?

25:02.677 --> 25:04.676
Have you seen Walker today?

25:04.677 --> 25:06.676
I'll go look.

25:06.677 --> 25:09.676
... no longer tolerated,
especially by his own peers.

25:09.677 --> 25:12.677
The city is safe once again.

26:05.095 --> 26:11.512
You have a Wolfe-shaped
space in your soul.

26:11.677 --> 26:14.845
And I will live in there forever.

26:15.137 --> 26:17.429
Hey.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.917
Zora, did you hear what I said?

26:21.677 --> 26:22.677
I heard you.

26:23.677 --> 26:25.304
I'm...

26:25.596 --> 26:27.677
... just not in the mood to listen.

26:28.677 --> 26:29.676
You're gonna...

26:29.677 --> 26:31.677
You're gonna have a great career.

26:32.677 --> 26:33.677
It's just...

26:35.677 --> 26:36.677
I can't...

26:36.803 --> 26:39.677
I can't work with somebody
who won't take my advice.

26:47.387 --> 26:50.676
You're gonna be huge, kiddo,

26:50.677 --> 26:53.677
and I'm gonna be the asshole
that walked away from you.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.262
Shit.

27:20.137 --> 27:22.262
So, what did asshole want?

27:24.012 --> 27:26.677
To wish me luck learning how to walk again.

27:28.677 --> 27:31.676
You don't need him, you know.

27:31.677 --> 27:33.677
He's right. I fucked up.

27:36.677 --> 27:39.676
Yeah, you fucked up royally.

27:39.677 --> 27:42.928
You went in there alone,
when you knew you shouldn't,

27:43.220 --> 27:45.677
because you had something to prove.

27:49.677 --> 27:51.677
Fucked up royally.

27:56.137 --> 27:57.676
So now what?

27:57.677 --> 27:59.677
Now you own it.

28:00.677 --> 28:03.677
People will still
respect you if you own it.

28:05.677 --> 28:06.676
You're still you.

28:06.677 --> 28:08.677
Don't walk away from that.

28:11.677 --> 28:14.470
Do you ever even listen
to your own bullshit?

28:16.677 --> 28:18.095
Get better, Z-girl.

28:26.387 --> 28:27.677
Will you come see me again?

28:27.720 --> 28:29.676
Not if you're gonna whine.

28:29.677 --> 28:32.676
Fuck you.

28:32.677 --> 28:34.677
People keep saying that to me.

29:13.677 --> 29:14.837
I thought we could celebrate.

29:27.803 --> 29:29.676
I'm back on the wagon.

29:29.677 --> 29:32.676
But everything has leveled off, right?

29:32.677 --> 29:35.676
The Black Swan threat has diminished.

29:35.677 --> 29:38.554
Green all over. No red in sight.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.677
We dodged a bullet, my friend.

29:42.677 --> 29:43.676
For now.

29:43.677 --> 29:46.677
And I would like to be
sober enough to enjoy it.

29:55.677 --> 29:56.803
Ah...

29:57.095 --> 29:59.637
The hero of the day.

30:01.220 --> 30:04.512
It's always been the
difference between you and me.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.676
In the midst of unspeakable carnage,

30:08.677 --> 30:12.677
you still consider how
it plays to the masses.

30:14.677 --> 30:15.677
Mmm.

30:16.677 --> 30:18.676
I don't know, Johnny.

30:18.677 --> 30:20.676
Wolfe is dead.

30:20.677 --> 30:23.345
You're the man that killed him.

30:24.677 --> 30:28.676
The DA won't charge you with
anything we've brought her.

30:28.677 --> 30:33.676
And every young Power in the
world wants to learn at your feet.

30:33.677 --> 30:37.676
I'd say things have worked
out exactly as you wanted.

30:37.677 --> 30:40.970
What I wanted is in shambles.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.676
Wanna see something
rad? Here and Gone, dude.

30:47.677 --> 30:49.676
Now, if only we could
do some shit like that

30:49.677 --> 30:52.677
in front of "the powers that be"
cameras, we'd be fucking made, dude.

30:53.677 --> 30:54.676
You fucking did it, man.

30:54.677 --> 30:57.676
Johnny fucking Royalle, you did it, pal!

30:57.677 --> 31:01.677
Were we ever really friends, Christian?

31:05.677 --> 31:06.677
Once.

31:11.095 --> 31:12.677
How's Calista?

31:13.677 --> 31:15.677
Ask her yourself.

31:33.677 --> 31:34.677
Come in.

31:37.677 --> 31:38.677
Hey.

31:40.970 --> 31:44.095
I just thought I'd check up on you.

31:44.387 --> 31:47.677
I'm okay. I'm just ready to leave here.

31:48.677 --> 31:49.676
Where are you going?

31:49.677 --> 31:51.676
The Kidz house. It's empty.

31:51.677 --> 31:55.887
I thought if I was there, I
might help anyone that was lost.

32:03.677 --> 32:04.677
Calista.

32:07.677 --> 32:12.677
I told you once that I could
feel where my powers used to be.

32:15.677 --> 32:16.970
I used to reach for them,

32:17.262 --> 32:18.676
and feel so powerless

32:18.677 --> 32:19.720
when they weren't there.

32:21.677 --> 32:23.676
And I don't know if it was the Drainer bomb

32:23.677 --> 32:24.676
or something else,

32:24.677 --> 32:28.676
but that phantom limb is gone,

32:28.677 --> 32:30.677
and so is that feeling.

32:35.677 --> 32:37.677
But I'm not powerless.

32:38.677 --> 32:40.676
And neither are you.

32:40.677 --> 32:41.677
I know.

32:42.677 --> 32:43.677
Really.

32:45.095 --> 32:46.676
Call me if you need help.

32:46.677 --> 32:47.677
I will.

32:48.677 --> 32:49.676
You promise?

32:49.677 --> 32:50.676
I promise.

32:50.677 --> 32:51.677
Okay.

33:23.677 --> 33:25.512
We're in.

33:27.554 --> 33:28.676
What do we have?

33:28.677 --> 33:29.676
Everything.

33:29.677 --> 33:31.676
We know everything their Powers clients

33:31.677 --> 33:32.887
are doing and going to do,

33:33.137 --> 33:34.676
we know where they are
and where they're going,

33:34.677 --> 33:36.677
and we know all their dirty little secrets.

33:40.677 --> 33:44.676
Gosh, two times in one month.

33:44.677 --> 33:48.676
I'm gonna get spoiled.

33:48.677 --> 33:52.637
You still thinking about
making this the new normal?

33:52.677 --> 33:53.970
Are you talking about
me ditching Retro Girl

33:54.220 --> 33:55.677
or are you talking about you and me?

33:57.262 --> 33:58.677
Both.

34:02.677 --> 34:06.677
Well, wouldn't that be nice?

34:07.677 --> 34:09.554
We never did get the chance

34:09.677 --> 34:12.429
to just be Janice and Christian
when we were together, did we?

34:12.677 --> 34:16.677
It was always, "It's
Retro Girl and Diamond."

34:17.677 --> 34:19.676
Do you remember that night

34:19.677 --> 34:23.678
when we were in bed and
you called me Queen Noir?

34:27.677 --> 34:28.677
Yeah.

34:29.677 --> 34:31.676
Yeah, I'm sorry.

34:31.677 --> 34:33.676
I should have thrown you
right out that window.

34:33.677 --> 34:35.197
- You did throw me out the window.
- Did I?

34:35.262 --> 34:37.137
- Yeah, remember?
- Oh.

34:37.429 --> 34:40.137
Good for me. You deserved it.

34:40.429 --> 34:43.676
Come on, you had the whole
thing with Super Shock.

34:43.677 --> 34:44.676
Well, Patrick was my ex.

34:44.677 --> 34:47.677
We always reconnected when I was on my own.

34:50.677 --> 34:51.677
So...

34:51.928 --> 34:54.469
I can't retire, Christian.

34:55.677 --> 34:56.677
I know.

34:58.095 --> 34:59.676
The minute I heard about Wolfe,

34:59.677 --> 35:02.157
I knew that there was no possible
way I could have stayed away.

35:03.262 --> 35:04.677
Told you. I know.

35:08.677 --> 35:10.677
So, what about that other thing?

35:12.677 --> 35:14.554
What, you?

35:18.887 --> 35:22.053
I know what I want.
The question is, do you?

35:24.677 --> 35:26.677
What are you doing tonight?

35:28.677 --> 35:31.095
I have to go back on patrol.

35:31.345 --> 35:32.676
They need to know I'm out there.

35:32.677 --> 35:34.677
Okay, sure, yeah.

35:40.845 --> 35:44.137
- Is it work?
- Yeah.

35:44.429 --> 35:47.676
Deena's been chasing me all morning.

35:47.677 --> 35:50.677
Probably thinks I'm out grabbing a nooner.

35:52.677 --> 35:54.677
I have an hour.

35:55.677 --> 35:57.677
Really?

36:08.803 --> 36:11.677
Johnny. Where'd you go?

36:12.512 --> 36:14.387
I was running an errand.

36:15.677 --> 36:17.676
In Hong Kong.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.677
We could... we could go if you like.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.677
Johnny, I...

36:23.677 --> 36:24.677
Yeah, I know.

36:28.677 --> 36:30.470
Well, I'll be here.

36:31.053 --> 36:32.677
I know.

36:51.845 --> 36:54.676
You made this happen, Krispin.

36:54.677 --> 36:57.677
- _
- Kaotic Chic wouldn't exist without you.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.677
You ready to change the world?

37:15.677 --> 37:16.676
Hey, partner.

37:16.677 --> 37:18.676
Where the fuck you been?

37:18.677 --> 37:20.676
Uh...

37:20.677 --> 37:22.676
Doing things.

37:22.677 --> 37:24.676
I've been trying to find you all day.

37:24.677 --> 37:28.676
Well, Mom, uh, mostly doing fun things
