00:07.388 --> 00:09.022
<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:09.024 --> 00:10.289
Hey.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.591
Wait, Joanie!

00:12.593 --> 00:14.060
- Wait, wait.
- Joanie!

00:14.062 --> 00:15.695
- What are you doing?
- Let her do it.

00:18.133 --> 00:19.766
<i>I can't stand feeling like this.</i>

00:19.768 --> 00:21.134
Like?

00:21.136 --> 00:22.234
Like I've done everything I can.

00:22.236 --> 00:23.302
And still what?

00:23.304 --> 00:25.037
This town is not my home.

00:25.039 --> 00:27.373
Joanie's not my child, but I've tried.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.075
Now Alison gets everything
back, including you.

00:30.077 --> 00:32.043
We lost our child!

00:32.046 --> 00:33.245
I know.

00:33.247 --> 00:35.814
How am I ever gonna compete with that?

00:35.816 --> 00:37.783
I've proven myself consistently.

00:37.785 --> 00:40.085
I also really need to consider
whether my client is ready

00:40.087 --> 00:41.887
for unsupervised visits.

00:41.889 --> 00:45.657
The current situation has
been and remains stressful.

00:45.659 --> 00:48.093
<i>You could just say to
the judge at our next hearing</i>

00:48.095 --> 00:49.561
that you trust me.

00:49.563 --> 00:51.496
And you think I'm emotionally sound enough

00:51.498 --> 00:52.998
to take care of Joanie.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.766
Right, so I'm healthy enough to fuck,

00:55.768 --> 00:57.268
but not to be the mother of our child.

00:57.270 --> 00:58.670
There's a process in
place for a reason, Alison.

00:58.672 --> 01:00.471
No, I understand, thanks for coming by.

01:00.473 --> 01:03.774
Would you mind telling us where
you were last Wednesday night?

01:03.776 --> 01:06.110
He was home. With me.

01:06.112 --> 01:10.114
Cole will only ever see
you as a disaster, Alison.

01:10.116 --> 01:12.149
Whatever you do, however
competent you become,

01:12.151 --> 01:14.685
you will always be damaged goods to him.

01:14.687 --> 01:17.021
I need you to sign
those, it's a "no contest."

01:17.023 --> 01:18.756
<i>I told my lawyer that I don't want</i>

01:18.758 --> 01:21.092
<i>anything from you, I
just want a clean slate.</i>

02:39.836 --> 02:42.170
<i>There are multiple
things to consider here.</i>

02:42.172 --> 02:44.172
Whether my young client is even comfortable

02:44.174 --> 02:46.674
in an unsupervised
arrangement with Ms. Bailey

02:46.676 --> 02:48.109
is only part of the equation.

02:48.111 --> 02:50.912
Is Ms. Bailey actually prepared for this?

02:50.914 --> 02:52.913
She still doesn't have a permanent job,

02:52.915 --> 02:55.415
nor is she even divorced
from her second husband,

02:55.417 --> 02:56.850
who happens to be a convicted felon.

02:56.852 --> 02:58.218
Your Honor,

02:58.220 --> 03:00.520
Mr. Gutteman does not
have his facts straight.

03:00.522 --> 03:03.223
Ms. Bailey is partner in
a lucrative local business.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.792
And as for her second
husband, Noah Solloway,

03:05.794 --> 03:08.528
a judgment of divorce was just entered.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.931
Here is a copy for the
court, as well as counsel.

03:16.371 --> 03:18.705
Mr. Gutteman,
are you calling a witness?

03:18.707 --> 03:20.139
Yes, Your Honor.

03:20.141 --> 03:23.576
Um, I would like to call
Luisa Leon to the stand.

03:30.218 --> 03:31.750
Raise your right hand.

03:31.752 --> 03:34.619
Do you swear under the penalty of perjury

03:34.621 --> 03:36.421
that the testimony you're
going to give here today

03:36.423 --> 03:38.824
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

03:38.826 --> 03:40.559
I do.

03:40.561 --> 03:44.162
Ms. Leon, you have had the
occasion to see my client

03:44.164 --> 03:45.397
interact with her mother?

03:45.399 --> 03:47.065
Yes, of course.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.333
And in the time
since this court last adjourned,

03:48.335 --> 03:49.901
would you say the relationship

03:49.903 --> 03:52.303
between my client and Alison Bailey

03:52.305 --> 03:55.407
has improved or deteriorated?

03:55.409 --> 03:57.642
I would say it has improved.

03:57.644 --> 04:01.145
In fact, Joanie already
had an unsupervised visit.

04:01.147 --> 04:03.681
She slept alone at Alison's
place a few nights ago.

04:03.683 --> 04:06.150
It was her birthday.

04:06.152 --> 04:08.319
I see. So it
was a special occasion?

04:08.321 --> 04:10.355
Yeah. She came home very happy.

04:10.357 --> 04:12.790
But I would imagine you still
have significant concerns

04:12.792 --> 04:15.959
regarding Ms. Bailey having
regular, unsupervised visits...

04:15.961 --> 04:17.928
Objection. Leading the witness.

04:17.930 --> 04:18.962
Sustained.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.697
Mr. Gutteman, may I remind you

04:20.700 --> 04:23.534
that your job requires you
to be an impartial advocate

04:23.536 --> 04:24.935
for your young client?

04:24.937 --> 04:27.538
Honestly, I think we
should stop coming here.

04:27.540 --> 04:30.107
I'm tired of this process.

04:30.109 --> 04:31.641
You know, Joanie loves her mother

04:31.643 --> 04:34.444
and wants to be with her.

04:34.446 --> 04:36.380
I'm not a fan of Alison,

04:36.382 --> 04:38.148
but this isn't about me.

04:39.385 --> 04:41.118
She should have her daughter back.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.786
I'm sorry.

04:42.788 --> 04:45.622
Ms. Leon, when you say "she
should have her daughter back,"

04:45.624 --> 04:47.791
you mean you would be all right with

04:47.793 --> 04:49.158
unsupervised visits?

04:49.160 --> 04:51.795
No, shared custody, Mr. Gutteman.

04:51.797 --> 04:53.396
I'm talking about shared custody.

04:53.398 --> 04:55.298
Ms. Leon,
I think you're confused.

04:55.300 --> 04:58.200
Shared custody is not an option
on the table at the moment.

04:58.202 --> 04:59.969
Well, maybe it should be.

04:59.971 --> 05:01.203
Um...

05:01.205 --> 05:03.406
No.

05:03.408 --> 05:05.474
Your Honor, may I request

05:05.476 --> 05:07.376
a brief recess?

05:07.378 --> 05:09.711
Counsel, you can
each have five minutes

05:09.713 --> 05:11.247
to speak to your clients.

05:11.249 --> 05:12.929
And then I want to see you in my chambers.

05:41.711 --> 05:43.411
What happened?

05:43.413 --> 05:46.414
Cole is willing to
settle on shared custody.

05:46.416 --> 05:48.516
Will you agree to it?

05:48.518 --> 05:49.518
Me?

05:50.887 --> 05:52.553
Yes. Yes!

05:53.957 --> 05:56.023
My God. What...
this... this can't be real.

05:56.025 --> 05:57.925
It... it was Luisa's testimony.

05:57.927 --> 05:59.293
Did you have any idea she felt that way?

05:59.295 --> 06:01.562
No, no, no, I thought
she still hated me, I...

06:01.564 --> 06:03.698
Well, she's a good person. That's clear.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.300
We'll draw up the paperwork,
but consider it done.

06:06.302 --> 06:07.869
Congratulations, Alison.

06:07.871 --> 06:10.637
I know this was awful, but it's over now.

06:11.874 --> 06:14.041
Thank you.

06:14.877 --> 06:17.111
Thank you.

06:17.113 --> 06:19.380
Congrats.

06:19.382 --> 06:20.814
Thanks.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.525
Hey.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.663
I just dropped Joanie off with Luisa.

07:10.665 --> 07:13.098
She told me where to find you.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.537
Well, here I am.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.141
I-I brought you some coffee

07:23.143 --> 07:24.742
and a muffin.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.780
No?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.716
Okay.

07:31.718 --> 07:35.386
Well, I'll just leave it in
case you get hungry later.

07:43.830 --> 07:44.996
Wait.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.916
Look, I, I just came by

08:05.918 --> 08:09.920
to see if you were okay with
what happened today in court.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.222
Why wouldn't I be?

08:12.224 --> 08:14.190
I don't know, you just
seemed a little surprised

08:14.192 --> 08:16.426
by what Luisa did.

08:16.428 --> 08:18.595
Honestly,

08:18.597 --> 08:20.363
it seems a little fast to me.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.699
Right.

08:23.701 --> 08:25.401
You haven't exactly been
a model of consistency

08:25.403 --> 08:28.104
since you got back. You're still you.

08:28.106 --> 08:30.540
What is that supposed to mean?

08:30.542 --> 08:32.241
Nothing.

08:32.244 --> 08:33.376
Thanks for the muffin.

08:33.378 --> 08:35.077
Wait, do you seriously think that

08:35.078 --> 08:36.946
I'm... I'm not capable
of having custody back?

08:36.948 --> 08:39.015
I think that you ran away as
soon as the going got tough.

08:39.017 --> 08:40.549
So I just hope for Joanie's
sake that things are

08:40.551 --> 08:42.784
gonna run a little bit more
smoothly this time around.

08:42.787 --> 08:45.087
Wait, Cole, I thought you
understood why I had to go.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.856
Alison, I can't do this
with you today, okay?

08:46.858 --> 08:48.724
I got a whole crew showing
up. My brothers are coming.

08:48.726 --> 08:51.293
If they see you here, they're
gonna wonder what's going on.

08:54.431 --> 08:56.298
Fine.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.534
Congratulations on your divorce.

09:00.604 --> 09:01.803
Right.

09:01.805 --> 09:04.906
So that's what all this is about.

09:04.908 --> 09:06.542
You told me you hadn't seen him.

09:06.544 --> 09:09.110
Look.

09:09.112 --> 09:10.612
It was five minutes.

09:10.614 --> 09:12.480
We signed and he left.

09:14.951 --> 09:16.284
I thought you wanted me to get divorced.

09:16.286 --> 09:17.886
I don't care what you do.

09:17.888 --> 09:19.487
No, Gutteman told me that if
I wanted my daughter back...

09:19.489 --> 09:21.322
It's emblematic of the
whole problem, Alison.

09:21.324 --> 09:22.824
Wait, what "whole problem"?

09:22.826 --> 09:24.392
I can't trust you.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.063
Fuck you, Cole.

09:49.651 --> 09:51.451
Dr. Parry?

09:51.453 --> 09:53.120
Hey.

09:53.122 --> 09:56.656
Yeah, no, yeah, I-I'm doing great.

09:56.658 --> 09:58.792
It's so nice to hear from you.

10:02.831 --> 10:05.365
My God, I'm so sorry.

10:05.367 --> 10:06.966
How's she doing?

10:11.139 --> 10:12.639
Yeah, yeah.

10:12.641 --> 10:14.641
I-I, I'd love to.

10:14.643 --> 10:15.775
When?

10:16.978 --> 10:18.611
Yeah, tomorrow's fine, I...

10:18.613 --> 10:21.848
well, Joanie's with Cole, so it's perfect.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.482
Okay.

10:23.484 --> 10:25.785
Yeah, 11 a.m. Right?

10:25.787 --> 10:27.553
Yeah, I'll see you then.

11:30.783 --> 11:31.783
Hey.

11:45.964 --> 11:47.397
And when did it happen?

11:47.399 --> 11:48.932
Eight weeks ago.

11:48.934 --> 11:51.768
She's been on suicide
watch since she got here.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.870
I'm hoping that by talking to someone else

11:53.872 --> 11:55.806
who's been through it, it'll help.

12:03.949 --> 12:05.315
You okay?

12:09.221 --> 12:10.586
Yeah.

12:11.789 --> 12:13.556
Okay.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.136
Hi.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.974
I'm Alison.

12:31.976 --> 12:33.909
Can I join you?

12:40.817 --> 12:44.386
Did, Dr. Parry tell you who I am?

12:47.657 --> 12:49.591
You're the patient.

12:51.194 --> 12:53.294
That's right.

12:53.296 --> 12:55.229
I was here for a long time.

12:56.433 --> 12:58.500
How long?

12:58.502 --> 13:00.334
Six months.

13:00.336 --> 13:03.337
You must have been crazy.

13:03.339 --> 13:04.605
Yeah, well,

13:04.607 --> 13:06.540
I had a lot to work through.

13:09.379 --> 13:11.712
Maybe a little like you.

13:11.714 --> 13:13.547
I have to go home next week.

13:13.549 --> 13:15.816
My parents can't afford this.

13:20.823 --> 13:23.824
Are you looking forward to going home?

13:31.634 --> 13:33.567
What was her name?

13:38.840 --> 13:42.508
My son's name was Gabriel.

13:42.510 --> 13:44.610
After his grandfather.

13:51.186 --> 13:53.018
You know, I,

13:53.020 --> 13:55.321
I used to like to be in his room

13:55.323 --> 13:58.090
after he died.

13:58.092 --> 14:01.928
In his bed, you know,
surrounded by all his things.

14:08.002 --> 14:09.668
The sheets still had his smell,

14:09.670 --> 14:11.236
and I used to wrap them around a pillow

14:11.238 --> 14:14.940
and pretend I was holding him.

14:21.415 --> 14:23.282
My mom...

14:23.284 --> 14:25.384
put all of Dawn's things in a...

14:27.253 --> 14:30.789
storage as soon as she died.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.123
In a box.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.860
No, she can't do that.

14:34.862 --> 14:37.796
You have to tell her
to take them out again.

14:39.432 --> 14:41.766
You need her stuff around you. You can't...

14:41.768 --> 14:43.634
trying to erase her memory

14:43.636 --> 14:45.403
is... is not gonna help.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.979
I just...

14:58.151 --> 15:02.152
I just miss her so much.

15:02.154 --> 15:04.955
Hey, I think I've
got some Kleenex in here.

15:07.827 --> 15:08.993
I don't care.

15:18.970 --> 15:20.904
My mom...

15:20.906 --> 15:24.908
she's so worried about me.

15:25.810 --> 15:27.977
She just...

15:27.979 --> 15:30.247
she wants me

15:30.249 --> 15:33.016
to be better.

15:33.018 --> 15:37.420
She wants me to be myself again.

15:37.422 --> 15:39.589
Well,

15:39.591 --> 15:44.360
you're not gonna be better for a while.

15:44.362 --> 15:46.596
And you won't ever be the same.

15:47.766 --> 15:49.831
She has to understand that.

15:54.838 --> 15:58.840
I spend a lot of time

15:58.842 --> 16:01.510
trying to f-figure out

16:01.512 --> 16:03.512
a way to

16:03.514 --> 16:06.782
kill myself and

16:06.784 --> 16:08.850
make it look like an accident.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.791
Please don't tell them I-I told you that.

16:15.793 --> 16:18.159
No, I won't. I won't.

16:18.161 --> 16:21.029
I get it, though.

16:21.031 --> 16:23.864
I came close a few times too.

16:23.866 --> 16:25.866
You did?

16:27.637 --> 16:31.306
Why not?

16:31.308 --> 16:33.874
What did you do?

16:37.814 --> 16:41.148
I had an affair.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.186
- Damn.
- Yeah.

16:46.188 --> 16:48.422
Well, I wouldn't recommend
it. It didn't end well.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.260
But you do whatever you have to do.

16:53.262 --> 16:57.264
Dying is not the answer.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.767
I know it feels like a
good solution right now,

17:00.769 --> 17:03.203
but you want to live.

17:04.873 --> 17:07.340
How do you know that?

17:07.343 --> 17:10.344
Because it's incredible to be alive.

17:14.182 --> 17:15.915
Everyone else assumes

17:15.916 --> 17:19.352
that life is a given.

17:19.354 --> 17:21.788
But you and I both know that it's not.

17:23.791 --> 17:26.358
You and I both know that

17:26.361 --> 17:30.095
breath can end.

17:30.097 --> 17:33.266
So we know that life is a gift.

17:38.273 --> 17:41.641
You'll miss Dawn, but
you'll keep her with you.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.476
You'll keep that memory alive.

17:44.478 --> 17:46.478
And you'll live now for both of you.

17:50.985 --> 17:52.417
Hey.

17:59.093 --> 18:00.159
No.

18:36.295 --> 18:37.361
Hey.

18:37.363 --> 18:39.263
I'm sorry about before.

18:39.265 --> 18:40.497
Look, I-I don't want to fight.

18:40.499 --> 18:41.998
I...

18:42.000 --> 18:44.301
I should have told you
that I talked to Noah.

18:46.272 --> 18:47.438
Okay.

18:49.709 --> 18:52.442
Can I talk to you about something else?

18:52.444 --> 18:54.444
Sure. What's up?

18:55.680 --> 18:58.014
Guess where I was this morning?

18:58.016 --> 18:59.382
I got no idea, Ally.

18:59.384 --> 19:01.017
I was at Woodlawn.

19:01.019 --> 19:04.387
I talked to this woman
who had lost her child.

19:06.158 --> 19:07.490
Wow.

19:07.492 --> 19:08.958
How was that?

19:08.960 --> 19:11.060
It was really intense.

19:11.062 --> 19:15.798
She was so young. She...
much younger than we were.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.234
And she was in so much
pain, you could almost see

19:18.236 --> 19:21.471
the film of grief over her eyes.

19:21.473 --> 19:23.372
Yeah, I remember it.

19:23.374 --> 19:25.808
Yeah, but I think I
helped her. I really do.

19:25.810 --> 19:28.144
And, um, Dr. Parry, that's my doctor,

19:28.146 --> 19:30.012
she told me that someone like me,

19:30.014 --> 19:31.713
with my experience,

19:31.715 --> 19:34.884
I could turn this into a career.

19:34.886 --> 19:35.885
A career?

19:35.887 --> 19:37.086
Yeah.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.821
They're creating a new program.

19:38.823 --> 19:42.056
What they want to do is train
parents who have lost a child

19:42.058 --> 19:43.659
to become grief counselors.

19:43.661 --> 19:45.160
And they think the only people

19:45.162 --> 19:47.329
that can really understand that experience

19:47.331 --> 19:49.164
are those that have been through it before.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.600
I don't understand. You're
moving to New Jersey?

19:51.602 --> 19:53.835
What? No, I commute.

19:53.837 --> 19:56.004
Alison, that's four hours away.

19:56.006 --> 19:57.605
Well... well, yeah, um,

19:57.607 --> 19:59.908
maybe I'll spend a few
days a week up there.

19:59.910 --> 20:01.876
So this is a full-time job then?

20:01.878 --> 20:05.013
No, I-I... we haven't worked
out the specifics yet, I...

20:05.015 --> 20:06.281
What about Joanie?

20:06.283 --> 20:07.548
What about her?

20:07.550 --> 20:09.517
What, you just gonna abandon her again?

20:09.519 --> 20:10.685
No.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.120
- No.
- So then what?

20:12.122 --> 20:13.621
- You're gonna take her from me?
- Wait, no.

20:13.623 --> 20:15.022
- From our home?
- Cole, stop.

20:15.024 --> 20:16.424
I-I-I haven't thought
about any of this.

20:16.426 --> 20:18.392
Why not?

20:18.394 --> 20:21.061
This is exactly why I didn't
want you to have custody yet.

20:21.063 --> 20:23.297
I knew you were gonna
do something like this.

20:23.299 --> 20:25.733
It's been, what, 24 hours?

20:25.735 --> 20:27.267
Less?

20:27.269 --> 20:28.736
And you just can't help yourself, can you?

20:28.738 --> 20:30.070
Wait, Cole, I think
you're missing the point...

20:30.072 --> 20:31.404
No, you are missing the point.

20:31.406 --> 20:33.307
What happened in court is a miracle.

20:33.309 --> 20:35.475
Why can't you see that?

20:35.477 --> 20:38.378
Why can't you just be
happy and say thank you?

20:38.380 --> 20:41.748
You have to keep on pushing and pushing.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.550
I forget this about you.

20:43.552 --> 20:46.118
I get so caught up in
you and I and our history

20:46.120 --> 20:48.054
and everything that that entails.

20:48.056 --> 20:50.122
But this is who you are.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.925
You're chaos. And I can't live like that.

20:52.927 --> 20:54.794
Well nobody's asking you to.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.095
Really?

20:56.097 --> 20:58.130
Then why are you here?

20:58.132 --> 21:00.233
I just...

21:00.235 --> 21:02.401
I just wanted to share it with you.

21:02.403 --> 21:03.469
Why?

21:03.471 --> 21:05.137
Because...

21:05.139 --> 21:06.772
you're the only person
who could understand.

21:06.774 --> 21:07.907
I...

21:11.846 --> 21:14.513
I just don't get why you're so angry.

21:14.515 --> 21:17.316
I thought you'd be happy for me.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.485
Of course you did, Alison,

21:19.487 --> 21:21.353
<i>'cause it's about you.</i>

21:21.355 --> 21:23.889
Everything's always about you.

21:42.209 --> 21:44.609
Hey.

21:44.611 --> 21:47.012
Heard you had a big day yesterday, Bailey.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.447
Wow. Word travels fast.

21:49.449 --> 21:50.648
I'm happy for you.

21:50.650 --> 21:52.049
I like it when the good guys win.

21:52.051 --> 21:53.785
Yeah, well.

21:53.787 --> 21:56.053
You're a good guy, Clay.

21:56.055 --> 21:57.054
What'll it be tonight?

21:57.056 --> 21:58.689
I don't know.

21:58.691 --> 22:00.357
Something really stiff.

22:00.359 --> 22:03.394
How about a Long Island Iced Tea?

22:09.568 --> 22:12.369
Um, I was getting dinner in town

22:12.371 --> 22:13.304
and I saw you walk in.

22:13.306 --> 22:15.139
Mind if I sit?

22:15.141 --> 22:17.975
No... no, sure.

22:17.977 --> 22:19.076
Um...

22:20.146 --> 22:22.146
Two Long Island Iced Teas.

22:25.684 --> 22:27.083
How are you?

22:27.085 --> 22:28.405
- You look good.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

22:29.154 --> 22:30.520
How are you?

22:30.522 --> 22:32.656
Um, I've been better.

22:38.864 --> 22:40.997
You want to talk about it?

22:42.233 --> 22:43.699
No.

22:43.701 --> 22:44.867
No.

22:49.507 --> 22:52.275
So you're still living here?
I didn't... I didn't know that.

22:53.911 --> 22:57.246
Well, yeah, I have a lot
of reasons to be here, and...

22:57.248 --> 22:58.948
Your daughter's here, right?

22:58.950 --> 23:00.616
Yeah.

23:03.955 --> 23:06.789
She turned out not to be Noah's?

23:09.259 --> 23:10.693
No.

23:14.731 --> 23:17.032
I loved hearing that.

23:22.039 --> 23:23.538
I'm sorry.

23:23.540 --> 23:24.939
I'm not trying to be a bitch.

23:24.941 --> 23:26.608
I'm just having a really weird day.

23:26.610 --> 23:27.909
Yeah, me too.

23:42.091 --> 23:45.059
Have you seen him recently?

23:45.061 --> 23:46.728
Noah?

23:46.730 --> 23:49.063
Yeah, I'm just wondering if, you know,

23:49.065 --> 23:49.897
how he is.

23:49.899 --> 23:51.832
Um...

23:51.834 --> 23:55.836
He's been staying at my place, actually.

23:55.838 --> 23:57.771
He is?

23:59.242 --> 24:00.474
Just for a few days.

24:00.476 --> 24:01.842
His neck got infected

24:01.844 --> 24:05.012
and... and my boyfriend's
a... a doctor, so...

24:05.014 --> 24:06.414
Wow, that's so nice of you. That...

24:09.752 --> 24:11.752
Do they know who did it?

24:11.754 --> 24:13.687
No.

24:13.689 --> 24:15.255
Think it's random.

24:15.257 --> 24:17.190
- God, it's so weird.
- I know.

24:19.528 --> 24:21.027
When's the last time you saw him?

24:21.029 --> 24:24.431
A few days ago.

24:25.367 --> 24:28.468
What? Why?

24:28.470 --> 24:32.004
We signed the divorce papers.

24:32.006 --> 24:34.707
You're divorced from Noah?

24:34.709 --> 24:36.142
Yeah.

24:36.144 --> 24:37.710
And so am I.

24:43.284 --> 24:45.517
Cheers.

24:53.461 --> 24:55.360
Hey, can I ask you something?

24:55.362 --> 24:57.296
Okay.

24:57.298 --> 24:59.331
Who was he with you?

24:59.333 --> 25:00.665
What do you mean?

25:00.667 --> 25:05.370
I mean, how would you describe this person,

25:05.372 --> 25:08.173
Noah Solloway?

25:08.175 --> 25:09.908
Um...

25:14.514 --> 25:18.516
I'd say he was charming.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.086
Very smart.

25:21.088 --> 25:22.687
Intensely driven.

25:22.689 --> 25:26.524
I've never met anyone
that ambitious before.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.494
What?

25:29.496 --> 25:31.429
Nothing. Go on.

25:34.234 --> 25:35.500
Um...

25:35.502 --> 25:38.035
He was very mature.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.037
You know, he seemed like a man that

25:40.039 --> 25:42.373
could take care of things.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.847
That's not how you saw him?

25:49.849 --> 25:52.516
I found him to be

25:52.518 --> 25:54.618
<i>so insecure.</i>

25:54.620 --> 25:56.520
I mean, obviously very intelligent,

25:56.522 --> 25:58.856
but I always was after him to hustle more,

25:58.858 --> 26:01.090
call his publisher, or

26:01.092 --> 26:03.593
stand up to my father.

26:05.464 --> 26:09.032
It's like he was a completely
different person with you.

26:09.034 --> 26:13.036
I think people see what they
want to see in other people.

26:17.441 --> 26:20.576
You know, I used to think
that he was never really yours,

26:20.578 --> 26:22.779
that I was just

26:22.781 --> 26:25.782
loaning him to you until

26:25.784 --> 26:27.717
he'd had enough and decided to come home,

26:27.719 --> 26:29.218
even after you'd gotten married.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.953
Isn't that pathetic?

26:30.955 --> 26:33.622
Helen, I'm sorry.

26:33.624 --> 26:37.125
I'm really sorry for what I did.

26:37.127 --> 26:39.228
He was your husband. You had children.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.564
I shouldn't have...

26:41.566 --> 26:43.566
I'm so sorry.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.870
But it's not your fault.

26:51.942 --> 26:53.942
I mean,

26:53.944 --> 26:56.444
men need to feel

26:56.446 --> 26:58.780
important in order to
stay in a relationship,

26:58.782 --> 27:00.982
and I stopped making Noah feel important

27:00.984 --> 27:03.418
years before he met you.

27:05.488 --> 27:08.223
So don't blame yourself for what happened.

27:11.094 --> 27:12.793
Helen, I want to tell you something

27:12.795 --> 27:14.128
about the night that Scotty died...

27:14.130 --> 27:15.930
- No, don't.
- I...

27:15.932 --> 27:17.532
No, I think it would help you to hear...

27:17.534 --> 27:20.635
Why don't you just let it go, Alison?

27:20.637 --> 27:23.771
I mean, what does it matter?

27:23.773 --> 27:27.174
It's not like we can go back.

27:27.176 --> 27:29.777
It was nice seeing you.

27:29.779 --> 27:31.278
Take care of yourself.

27:45.361 --> 27:46.493
Weird night?

28:13.321 --> 28:15.053
Chris?

28:15.055 --> 28:16.989
Hey. What's wrong?

28:16.991 --> 28:18.857
I just wanted
to give you a heads-up.

28:18.859 --> 28:22.261
The New Jersey cops are back
in Montauk, questioning Cole.

28:22.263 --> 28:23.663
About what?

28:23.665 --> 28:26.766
Noah Solloway's attempted murder.

28:26.768 --> 28:29.268
His alibi the night of the
stabbing didn't hold up.

28:29.270 --> 28:30.568
What, he... he wasn't home?

28:30.570 --> 28:32.437
No. Apparently, they have

28:32.439 --> 28:34.706
some record of a toll he
paid on the Jersey Turnpike

28:34.708 --> 28:36.574
about ten miles from the university,

28:36.576 --> 28:38.677
an hour before Noah was stabbed.

28:41.348 --> 28:43.182
My God.

28:43.184 --> 28:44.683
Do you know anything about this?

28:44.685 --> 28:46.550
N-no.

28:46.552 --> 28:48.085
Because if you got something
to say, now would be the time.

28:48.087 --> 28:50.787
I swear I don't.

28:50.789 --> 28:52.323
Okay.

28:52.325 --> 28:53.757
Hopefully he was just

28:53.759 --> 28:55.926
going on a drive to look at the foliage.

28:55.928 --> 28:58.095
- Yeah.
- Sorry to bother you, Bailey.

28:58.097 --> 29:00.430
You have a good night.

29:00.432 --> 29:01.432
Thanks.

29:12.344 --> 29:14.277
I mean, I didn't plan it.

29:14.279 --> 29:16.079
It just came out.

29:16.081 --> 29:18.482
He asked me if... if Joanie seemed happy

29:18.484 --> 29:19.982
when she was with her.

29:19.984 --> 29:21.684
Was I supposed to lie?

29:21.686 --> 29:23.118
No.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.120
Of course I don't want you to lie.

29:27.358 --> 29:29.458
I just wish you could have
mentioned it to me first.

29:29.460 --> 29:30.926
That's what I'm saying.

29:30.928 --> 29:33.796
I didn't know I was going to do anything.

29:33.798 --> 29:35.264
Cole? Luisa?

29:35.266 --> 29:37.933
So, the judge is leaning
towards shared custody.

29:37.935 --> 29:39.501
What do you think?

29:39.503 --> 29:41.703
Would you agree to settle?

29:41.705 --> 29:43.005
Let's give her what she wants

29:43.007 --> 29:46.141
so we can stop thinking about her.

29:46.143 --> 29:49.144
I'm just so fucking tired
of talking about Alison.

30:14.304 --> 30:16.237
What the fuck?

30:18.241 --> 30:19.241
Fuck.

30:28.751 --> 30:31.485
Hey.

30:31.487 --> 30:32.820
What are you doing here?

30:36.224 --> 30:37.524
I brought donuts.

30:37.526 --> 30:39.259
Why?

30:39.261 --> 30:41.428
Well, I thought you might be hungry.

30:41.430 --> 30:44.730
And I wanted to say thank you for today.

30:44.732 --> 30:46.399
It wasn't my idea.

30:46.401 --> 30:47.934
Okay.

30:47.936 --> 30:51.104
But still, you agreed to
the settlement, so thank you.

30:51.106 --> 30:54.107
Ally, I'm not hungry.

30:54.109 --> 30:55.741
Yes, you are.

30:55.743 --> 30:57.377
- No, I'm not.
- I can tell you are.

30:57.379 --> 30:58.711
Getting that line between your eyes.

30:58.713 --> 30:59.612
- Alison...
- What?

30:59.614 --> 31:01.514
Can you please just go?

31:01.516 --> 31:03.415
My crew's about to show
up. My brother's are coming.

31:03.417 --> 31:05.618
I don't want them to see you here.

31:05.620 --> 31:07.520
Why? What are they gonna think?

31:07.522 --> 31:08.721
I don't know what they're gonna think,

31:08.723 --> 31:09.622
but I don't want any trouble.

31:09.624 --> 31:10.857
Wait...

31:10.859 --> 31:12.358
How is this trouble? I brought donuts.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.960
Come on, Ally, you got what you wanted.

31:13.962 --> 31:15.294
Okay, you got Joanie back.

31:15.296 --> 31:17.196
So what are you doing?

31:17.198 --> 31:20.432
I-I need you to leave me alone, Alison.

31:20.434 --> 31:23.302
We both agree that what
happened was a mistake.

31:23.304 --> 31:24.769
My God.

31:24.771 --> 31:26.638
That's... that's not why I'm here.

31:27.475 --> 31:28.740
You sure?

31:28.742 --> 31:29.774
Yes.

31:29.776 --> 31:31.910
I came to say thank you.

31:35.315 --> 31:38.617
Look, today meant a lot to me.

31:38.619 --> 31:40.685
It meant everything.

31:46.593 --> 31:49.127
I'll leave them here.

31:49.129 --> 31:51.195
In case you get hungry later.

31:57.670 --> 31:59.137
Fuck.

31:59.139 --> 32:00.438
Fuck.

32:17.356 --> 32:18.856
Hey, Willa.

32:18.858 --> 32:20.624
Cole, I was just about to lock up.

32:20.626 --> 32:21.958
I just got to talk to Jerry for a second.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.160
Is he in?

32:23.162 --> 32:24.827
Jerry is somewhere in the Florida Keys.

32:24.829 --> 32:26.096
For how long?

32:26.098 --> 32:27.497
For good. He retired last month.

32:27.499 --> 32:30.300
Couldn't wait to get the hell out of here.

32:30.302 --> 32:32.235
So who's the new building inspector?

32:33.705 --> 32:34.871
Hey. Are you Tim?

32:34.873 --> 32:36.139
Timothy.

32:36.141 --> 32:37.774
Timothy, my mistake.

32:37.776 --> 32:39.042
Cole Lockhart.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.710
Hey, Mr. Lockhart, pleasure to meet you.

32:40.712 --> 32:41.945
Pleasure's all mine.

32:41.947 --> 32:43.312
Congratulations on the new job.

32:43.314 --> 32:44.313
Thank you.

32:44.315 --> 32:45.682
I was out by your house earlier.

32:45.684 --> 32:49.151
Yeah, I know. I got your message.

32:49.153 --> 32:51.353
- Your survey's out of date.
- I don't think so.

32:51.355 --> 32:53.022
That survey's not more
than three years old.

32:53.024 --> 32:54.223
Correct.

32:54.225 --> 32:55.624
Right, so that's not out of date.

32:55.626 --> 32:57.159
Town law stipulates
that all new construction

32:57.161 --> 32:58.727
be based on a new survey.

32:58.729 --> 33:00.496
We've got to shut you down
till you get a new one.

33:00.498 --> 33:02.631
Come on, if I get... if I get a new survey,

33:02.633 --> 33:04.467
it's gonna cost me an arm and and leg.

33:04.469 --> 33:06.001
And it'll take me eight weeks
to get somebody out there.

33:06.003 --> 33:07.203
Maybe less.

33:07.205 --> 33:08.870
Even if it's six,

33:08.872 --> 33:10.172
I'm trying to get that
roof on before winter.

33:10.174 --> 33:11.740
If you shut me down now, I'm screwed.

33:11.742 --> 33:13.308
I'm sorry, with all the
new construction in town,

33:13.310 --> 33:15.376
we really must enforce the rules.

33:15.378 --> 33:18.046
All right, Timothy, I
know that you're new here.

33:18.048 --> 33:19.715
This is a small town.

33:19.717 --> 33:21.349
We take care of each other.

33:24.855 --> 33:27.722
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Lockhart.

33:27.724 --> 33:30.091
Heard that you're an upstanding
member of this community

33:30.093 --> 33:32.227
and someone people really look up to.

33:32.229 --> 33:34.028
I would think it'd be
important to you to continue

33:34.030 --> 33:36.731
to do things the proper way.

33:36.733 --> 33:39.734
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.

33:52.849 --> 33:53.681
Hey.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.950
Hey.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.852
What happened to you?

33:57.854 --> 33:59.086
Bath time.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.523
She asleep?

34:02.525 --> 34:05.692
No. She's watching a movie.

34:05.694 --> 34:09.795
I, um, I talked to her about
what happened today in court.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.965
And?

34:11.967 --> 34:15.435
Well, she's happy.

34:15.437 --> 34:16.969
We did the right thing.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.242
It's getting kind of late.

34:23.244 --> 34:24.476
If you can get her in her pajamas,

34:24.478 --> 34:26.212
I'll read her a bedtime story.

34:26.214 --> 34:28.281
Deal.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.583
Dinner's on the stove.

34:35.822 --> 34:37.022
Smells great.

34:44.165 --> 34:47.900
Um, so...

34:47.902 --> 34:49.835
I've been thinking.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.505
Maybe it's time for us to start

34:54.507 --> 34:56.775
our own family.

34:56.777 --> 35:00.612
We could adopt or find a surrogate.

35:00.614 --> 35:02.547
No?

35:05.019 --> 35:07.085
No, I-I mean, no, not "no."

35:07.087 --> 35:08.653
Yes.

35:08.655 --> 35:10.589
Definitely yes.

35:12.593 --> 35:14.926
Of course I want to
start a family with you.

35:14.928 --> 35:17.929
But I-I-I'm exhausted
tonight, babe.

35:19.766 --> 35:22.534
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

35:22.536 --> 35:23.968
Yeah.

35:25.638 --> 35:27.071
Sure.

35:38.351 --> 35:40.718
- Cole?
- Yeah?

35:40.720 --> 35:42.152
The fuck is wrong with you, man?

35:42.154 --> 35:43.887
They sent me from town council.

35:43.889 --> 35:45.322
- What are you talking about?
- I talked to Tim.

35:45.324 --> 35:47.324
You are unequivocally shut down.

35:47.326 --> 35:49.226
Fuck that guy.

35:49.228 --> 35:50.694
What's his price?

35:50.696 --> 35:52.296
- He doesn't have one.
- Bullshit.

35:52.298 --> 35:53.964
Everybody has a price. What's his?

35:53.966 --> 35:55.332
Cole, he's trying to
make an example of you.

35:55.334 --> 35:57.067
- He's not gonna budge.
- Why?

35:57.069 --> 35:59.035
Why? 'Cause you're a high-profile citizen,

35:59.037 --> 36:01.471
and he's trying to bring
some kind of order to this...

36:01.473 --> 36:04.040
backwater cesspool of
corruption we call home.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.508
Why'd you hire this guy in the first place?

36:05.510 --> 36:06.542
Just... listen... just

36:06.544 --> 36:07.543
shut it down for a few weeks.

36:07.545 --> 36:08.478
Just give me a minute.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.480
Fuck.

36:10.582 --> 36:13.149
Hello.

36:13.151 --> 36:15.318
Yeah, I'm just at a building site.

36:15.320 --> 36:18.554
Yes, I got your message about
the diapers, I already...

36:18.556 --> 36:21.090
No, I didn't make the appointment becau...

36:21.092 --> 36:22.759
because I-I don't think he's sick.

36:22.761 --> 36:24.860
I think he's teething,
but if you want me to...

36:24.862 --> 36:26.929
Hello?

36:26.931 --> 36:30.532
She's a fucking cunt.

36:30.534 --> 36:31.867
Everything okay?

36:31.869 --> 36:34.436
Yes, I meant that affectionately.

36:34.438 --> 36:36.172
Is there something wrong with Little O?

36:36.174 --> 36:37.873
No, he's teething.

36:37.875 --> 36:40.609
But he won't stop crying,
and Jenny's worried.

36:40.611 --> 36:43.112
And she's back at work
now and super stressed

36:43.114 --> 36:45.414
and the kid won't sleep and
we're fighting all the time

36:45.416 --> 36:47.382
and we never have sex, but other than that?

36:47.384 --> 36:49.117
Everything's great.

36:50.253 --> 36:52.086
You guys gonna be okay?

36:52.088 --> 36:53.422
What do you mean?

36:53.424 --> 36:55.357
Well, you just called your wife a cunt.

36:55.359 --> 36:58.360
Yeah, 'cause she makes me deeply miserable.

36:58.362 --> 37:01.563
But you mean are we gonna
split? No, of course not.

37:01.565 --> 37:03.231
Jenny's like a...

37:03.233 --> 37:05.733
she's like a solid B-plus.

37:05.735 --> 37:07.969
And let's face it, I'm a C.

37:07.971 --> 37:11.206
So if she needs to call and
yell at me and then hang up,

37:11.208 --> 37:13.208
if that makes her happy, well,

37:13.210 --> 37:15.243
it's a, small price to pay

37:15.245 --> 37:17.378
for a beautiful family, you know?

37:23.786 --> 37:25.419
You ever wonder what it'd be like,

37:25.421 --> 37:26.954
different life, different...

37:26.956 --> 37:28.723
Different, what, different girl?

37:31.961 --> 37:34.662
Like who?

37:38.067 --> 37:40.834
Come on.

37:40.836 --> 37:43.303
Is that what this is all about?

37:43.305 --> 37:47.307
The whole "I got to get a
roof on my house" bullshit?

37:47.309 --> 37:48.842
Thanks for stopping by, Oscar.

37:48.844 --> 37:50.410
Wait, wait, wait.

37:50.412 --> 37:53.346
- Are you fucking your ex-wife?
- Nope.

37:53.348 --> 37:55.448
Have you been fucking your ex-wife?

37:59.921 --> 38:01.855
What the fuck's wrong with you?

38:01.857 --> 38:04.257
Dude, you got a perfect
life. What are you doing?

38:04.259 --> 38:06.192
I don't know.

38:11.766 --> 38:14.767
Jesus Christ.

38:15.669 --> 38:18.004
Listen, man, I get it.

38:18.006 --> 38:21.340
Your ex-wife was one of a kind.

38:21.342 --> 38:24.777
But remember that thing
that happened five years ago?

38:24.779 --> 38:27.279
Where she left you, shattered your heart

38:27.281 --> 38:28.714
in a million pieces,

38:28.716 --> 38:30.148
and then ground the shards
between her teeth, yeah?

38:30.150 --> 38:32.150
Yes, yes, I remember.

38:32.152 --> 38:34.152
So why are we even
having this conversation?

38:34.154 --> 38:35.487
I don't know.

38:38.659 --> 38:42.394
I don't know what I'm doing.

38:42.396 --> 38:45.696
And if you tell Luisa, I'll kill you.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.364
Come on, buddy.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.133
You're talking to the new Oscar Hodges now.

38:49.135 --> 38:51.235
I'm not interested in
blowing up anyone's life.

38:51.237 --> 38:54.238
I got my own to worry about.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.007
You know, when I first met Jenny,

38:57.009 --> 39:00.812
I fell for her like the fucking Hindenburg.

39:00.814 --> 39:03.213
I mean, she was like
some sort of nymphomaniac.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.849
I thought I was setting myself up for

39:05.851 --> 39:07.584
a lifetime of blowjobs.

39:08.587 --> 39:10.154
Now, a scant three years later,

39:10.156 --> 39:11.255
instead of getting laid at night,

39:11.257 --> 39:12.722
I find myself up changing diapers.

39:12.724 --> 39:14.724
Yeah.

39:14.726 --> 39:16.660
Last night, I didn't
have a clean one ready.

39:16.662 --> 39:17.995
Little O started to squirm.

39:17.997 --> 39:19.496
So I reached out my hand

39:19.498 --> 39:21.030
and I let him shit in it.

39:23.268 --> 39:24.267
But you know what occurred to me

39:24.269 --> 39:26.570
while that was happening?

39:26.572 --> 39:28.338
Nope.

39:28.340 --> 39:29.940
I thought,

39:29.942 --> 39:31.842
this is what happens when
you fall in love with someone.

39:31.844 --> 39:35.512
This is where it all leads.

39:35.514 --> 39:37.347
So,

39:37.349 --> 39:38.848
if that's where it's heading anyhow,

39:38.850 --> 39:41.084
wouldn't you rather Luisa to fall back on,

39:41.086 --> 39:43.119
the woman you know will
be there to catch you,

39:43.121 --> 39:44.954
than Alison, who nine times out of ten

39:44.956 --> 39:47.256
will probably just let you fall?

39:50.728 --> 39:52.061
Good seeing you.

39:52.063 --> 39:53.896
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Okay.

39:55.900 --> 39:59.869
Hey, great talk.

39:59.871 --> 40:01.269
Shut it down.

40:01.271 --> 40:02.404
Yeah.

40:05.042 --> 40:07.943
Last survey was done
three years ago, November.

40:07.945 --> 40:09.411
- Hey, Cole.
- I mean, as soon as

40:09.413 --> 40:10.912
you can get out there. Hold on, hold on.

40:10.914 --> 40:13.248
Yeah. Next week'll be fine.

40:13.250 --> 40:14.416
I'll see you at the house. Thank you.

40:14.418 --> 40:16.051
Bye.

40:16.053 --> 40:17.419
Ally, I told you yesterday, I really...

40:17.421 --> 40:20.755
No, look, I had a... a
really significant day.

40:20.757 --> 40:23.791
I was at Woodlawn and I was
counseling a grieving mother.

40:23.793 --> 40:27.629
And it went so well
they've offered me a job.

40:27.631 --> 40:29.130
A job?

40:29.132 --> 40:30.665
Yeah.

40:30.667 --> 40:31.766
There's starting this new program, and...

40:31.768 --> 40:34.235
Hold on, did you take it?

40:34.237 --> 40:36.004
Yeah, I did.

40:36.006 --> 40:37.772
Woodlawn is in New Jersey.

40:37.774 --> 40:39.507
Well, that's not the point.

40:39.509 --> 40:40.975
Okay, so what's the point then?

40:40.977 --> 40:43.411
What... aren't you happy for me?

40:43.413 --> 40:45.413
If you start working in New Jersey,

40:45.415 --> 40:47.114
what are we gonna do about Joanie?

40:47.116 --> 40:48.682
You think you're taking
her? You're gonna leave her?

40:48.684 --> 40:49.816
What... I thought I could
take her half the week.

40:49.818 --> 40:51.285
She has school.

40:51.287 --> 40:52.619
Well, she's got kindergarten.

40:52.621 --> 40:54.155
We can find one there in New Jersey.

40:54.157 --> 40:55.856
- It's fine... what?
- Jesus Christ.

40:55.858 --> 40:57.691
Nothing, I just thought it was
gonna be different this time.

40:57.693 --> 40:59.426
What was gonna be different?

40:59.428 --> 41:01.161
I thought maybe you'd stay in
one place for a little while.

41:01.163 --> 41:03.296
Well, okay, if you want
Joanie here the whole week,

41:03.298 --> 41:04.831
we can talk about that. It's not...

41:04.833 --> 41:06.934
What I want is for you to
be a responsible human being

41:06.936 --> 41:08.368
who doesn't just do the first fucking thing

41:08.370 --> 41:10.170
that pops into your head.

41:10.172 --> 41:12.105
I don't have time for
your craziness today, Ally.

41:12.107 --> 41:14.975
It's a good thing I'm
so fucked up, isn't it?

41:14.977 --> 41:16.509
What's that?

41:16.511 --> 41:20.146
Well, as long as I'm
crazy, you get to be sane.

41:24.319 --> 41:26.319
Hey.

41:26.321 --> 41:28.154
Let's do it.

41:28.156 --> 41:29.522
Okay.

41:29.524 --> 41:30.957
I'm ready. Let's start our own family.

41:30.959 --> 41:33.626
We could even use your
sister as a surrogate.

41:33.628 --> 41:35.527
What?

41:35.529 --> 41:36.662
I'm sorry I've been acting so
crazy for the last couple days,

41:36.664 --> 41:37.797
but I was thinking about this.

41:37.799 --> 41:39.198
You want a family. I want a family.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.800
So let's do it.

41:40.802 --> 41:41.801
I'm gonna call a doctor
first thing tomorrow morning

41:41.803 --> 41:44.369
and... and figure out the process.

41:44.371 --> 41:45.671
Okay.

41:45.673 --> 41:46.839
Um...

41:46.841 --> 41:48.807
I think we should sleep on it.

41:48.809 --> 41:51.343
And maybe we can talk when
you're a little bit calmer?

41:51.345 --> 41:52.978
Babe, I'm calm. I want this.

41:58.819 --> 42:00.252
Yeah?

42:04.758 --> 42:06.024
Mr. Lockhart.

42:06.026 --> 42:07.325
What now?

42:08.394 --> 42:09.393
Yeah, I get it.

42:09.395 --> 42:11.362
I'm in a shit mood too.

42:11.364 --> 42:13.932
It sucks having to drive
all the way out here again

42:13.934 --> 42:16.101
just to ask the same question twice,

42:16.103 --> 42:18.269
but here goes...

42:18.271 --> 42:20.772
where were you the night
that Noah Solloway was attacked?

42:20.774 --> 42:22.740
- I already told you.
- Your home, right.

42:22.742 --> 42:26.244
Except you didn't tell us, your wife did.

42:26.246 --> 42:28.579
Why do we have a
picture of you at a tollbooth

42:28.581 --> 42:30.381
right after the George Washington Bridge,

42:30.383 --> 42:31.616
the evening of the stabbing?

42:31.618 --> 42:33.117
You used your E-ZPass.

42:33.119 --> 42:34.619
They keep records of stuff like that, so.

42:34.621 --> 42:36.387
And the GWB is about 40 minutes

42:36.389 --> 42:39.589
from Livingston University,
but maybe you already knew that.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.125
Look, Mr. Lockhart, why
don't you just tell us

42:41.127 --> 42:42.592
where you really were that night?

42:42.594 --> 42:44.594
I told you already. I was with my wife.

42:44.596 --> 42:46.764
You're about to make this a
whole lot harder on yourself.

42:46.766 --> 42:49.033
Yeah, if you don't come
clean, you're about to become

42:49.035 --> 42:50.600
our number one suspect.

42:50.602 --> 42:52.036
Really? Is that a promise?

42:52.038 --> 42:53.403
Just tell them where you were.

42:54.706 --> 42:56.273
Why don't you listen to your wife, man?

42:56.275 --> 42:57.274
Why don't you get the
fuck off my property...

42:57.276 --> 42:58.975
Fuck, really?

42:58.977 --> 43:00.910
Take it easy!

43:00.912 --> 43:03.446
Put the cuffs on.

43:03.448 --> 43:05.415
Mr. Lockhart, man, bad move.

43:05.417 --> 43:06.983
Let's go.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.996
Chris Gibbons
told me you were here.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.736
I got him to let
me back so I could see you.

43:28.906 --> 43:32.774
Why?

43:32.776 --> 43:35.444
Look, Cole, we've basically

43:35.446 --> 43:37.946
known each other,

43:37.948 --> 43:41.783
like, our whole lives.

43:42.853 --> 43:43.852
And you're a lot of things,

43:43.854 --> 43:46.454
but you're not a liar.

43:46.456 --> 43:49.490
So just tell me.

43:49.492 --> 43:51.927
- If you stabbed Noah, that...
- Jesus Christ.

43:51.929 --> 43:53.695
No.

43:53.697 --> 43:55.630
I wasn't anywhere near the guy.

43:59.103 --> 44:02.437
Then where were you that night?

44:07.510 --> 44:11.011
I went up to Woodlawn.

44:11.013 --> 44:13.648
What?

44:13.650 --> 44:15.816
To talk to your doctor.

44:15.818 --> 44:18.485
Dr. Parry, right, that's her name?

44:18.487 --> 44:20.621
Yeah. Why?

44:21.858 --> 44:23.791
To talk about you.

44:30.399 --> 44:34.768
When you got back to Montauk,
you seemed... clearer.

44:36.472 --> 44:39.072
Seeing you, seeing you with Joanie,

44:39.074 --> 44:42.008
just brought a lot of thoughts back to me.

44:43.579 --> 44:46.346
Well, what kind of thoughts?

44:48.317 --> 44:49.916
About us.

44:56.191 --> 44:57.590
Okay.

45:04.032 --> 45:07.132
Well, why did you need to see my doctor?

45:09.003 --> 45:12.037
I needed her professional opinion, I guess.

45:12.039 --> 45:13.238
About what?

45:13.240 --> 45:16.241
About how you are.

45:16.243 --> 45:17.610
Are you kidding me?

45:17.612 --> 45:20.245
What, you, like, you needed permission?

45:20.247 --> 45:21.514
Yeah.

45:24.351 --> 45:26.584
Okay, and, what did she say?

45:26.586 --> 45:27.619
Nothing.

45:27.621 --> 45:29.554
She's a very ethical doctor.

45:31.425 --> 45:33.225
Okay, wait, so,

45:33.227 --> 45:35.593
this is the big secret that...
that you've been hiding?

45:35.595 --> 45:37.029
Yeah.

45:37.031 --> 45:39.031
Well, tell the detectives that.

45:39.033 --> 45:40.097
- I can't.
- Why not?

45:40.099 --> 45:41.065
Why do you think?

45:41.067 --> 45:42.567
Well, I-I-I have no idea.

45:42.569 --> 45:44.135
If I admit that I went up to Woodlawn,

45:44.137 --> 45:46.571
then I have to admit
everything to everybody.

45:46.573 --> 45:48.206
A-admit what?

45:49.476 --> 45:51.609
Alison,

45:51.611 --> 45:53.110
I built this whole life,

45:53.112 --> 45:55.079
I'm building a whole house

45:55.081 --> 45:56.647
just to prove to everybody

45:56.649 --> 45:58.415
that I don't love you anymore,

45:58.417 --> 46:00.617
that I don't need you,
that I don't want you,

46:00.619 --> 46:02.386
that I don't miss you.

46:06.059 --> 46:08.659
But the truth is that I do.

46:14.667 --> 46:16.800
I need you.

46:16.802 --> 46:18.669
And I want you and I miss you

46:18.671 --> 46:21.071
and I love you.

46:21.073 --> 46:24.742
And I'm tired of pretending that I don't.

46:26.746 --> 46:29.746
So stop pretending.

46:32.751 --> 46:35.318
I can't.

46:38.323 --> 46:39.856
Why?

46:46.330 --> 46:49.164
'Cause I'm not Noah Solloway.

46:50.368 --> 46:53.770
I am a good man.

46:53.772 --> 46:55.137
And I would have to be crazy

46:55.139 --> 46:56.773
to trust you after what you did to me,

46:56.775 --> 46:58.608
and I can't go down that rabbit hole again.

46:58.610 --> 47:00.676
I'm not gonna jeopardize
everything that I've built.

47:00.678 --> 47:02.378
Yeah, then don't walk away.

47:02.380 --> 47:05.514
Jesus, nobody is holding
a gun to your head.

47:08.519 --> 47:11.520
But you know you have
to make a decision, Cole.

47:14.025 --> 47:15.457
And look, this is me.

47:15.459 --> 47:17.326
I'm not hiding anything from you.

47:17.328 --> 47:19.160
I've worked really hard on myself,

47:19.162 --> 47:22.196
and I am stronger in a lot of ways

47:22.198 --> 47:23.532
than I used to be,

47:23.534 --> 47:27.402
but I am always gonna be impulsive.

47:27.404 --> 47:29.738
And depressed.

47:29.740 --> 47:31.372
With mood swings.

47:31.374 --> 47:32.974
Yeah, I know that I am not

47:32.976 --> 47:36.510
an easy person to love.

47:36.512 --> 47:38.579
But I love you.

47:41.584 --> 47:42.550
I always have

47:42.552 --> 47:44.919
and I always will.

47:49.926 --> 47:53.026
You know, but this is
your decision to make.

47:55.865 --> 47:58.499
Yeah, I-I don't envy you.

48:43.611 --> 48:47.412
Hey.

48:47.414 --> 48:48.414
Hey.

48:49.582 --> 48:51.916
What did you tell them?

48:54.087 --> 48:56.021
The truth.

48:58.058 --> 49:00.458
Told 'em I went up to the place
Alison was getting treated.

49:00.460 --> 49:04.228
To talk to her doctor.

49:06.298 --> 49:07.331
Why?

49:11.571 --> 49:14.138
I wanted evidence about her mental state.

49:14.140 --> 49:16.741
To use in the custody case.

49:19.812 --> 49:21.978
Why would you lie to the police for so long

49:21.980 --> 49:24.548
about something so simple?

49:25.751 --> 49:26.950
I don't know.

49:40.298 --> 49:42.732
I think you're still lying.

49:44.937 --> 49:48.304
I can't talk about this anymore, Luisa.

49:48.306 --> 49:49.973
Good night.

51:02.545 --> 51:05.513
We keep coming back to each other.

51:09.585 --> 51:11.018
I know.

51:12.488 --> 51:15.422
Don't you think that means something?

51:17.893 --> 51:20.827
I think that means we were unfinished.

51:22.931 --> 51:25.932
And now... we are?

51:33.074 --> 51:34.840
You're scared.

51:36.344 --> 51:37.843
I think you're giving up

51:37.845 --> 51:41.314
because we've made a mess of everything,

51:41.316 --> 51:43.449
and it's too complicated.

51:44.619 --> 51:46.819
If you leave Luisa now,

51:46.821 --> 51:49.755
you can't play the good guy anymore.

51:52.326 --> 51:55.260
Then you're an asshole, just like me.

51:56.998 --> 51:59.932
Yeah, but maybe you're a happy asshole.

52:04.972 --> 52:07.972
Instead of a miserable hero.

52:18.686 --> 52:20.118
You know,

52:20.120 --> 52:25.056
if you ever need me,

52:25.058 --> 52:28.459
you know where to find me.

53:37.262 --> 53:39.195
You're still here.

53:45.102 --> 53:47.670
This is my home.

53:49.106 --> 53:51.473
Our home.

53:52.810 --> 53:55.277
If you'll still have me.

54:07.557 --> 54:10.391
I'll still have you.
