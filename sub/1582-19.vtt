Eh, welcome fellow barkeeps,

02:12.079 --> 02:15.448
We are all here because drinkin'
in our bars is down.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.785
Mom-and-pop bartenders can't

02:31.699 --> 02:32.966
Uh, please remain calm.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.568
Now let's watch
this informational video

02:34.602 --> 02:38.004
that'll help save our business.

02:38.839 --> 02:40.173
Thanks, Cap.

02:40.208 --> 02:43.777
Now what I'm proposing
is a superhero pub crawl.

02:43.811 --> 02:45.912
Our clientele dress up
in costume

02:45.947 --> 02:47.681
and go drinking from bar to bar.

02:47.715 --> 02:51.117
Their masks make 'em feel
uninhibited and invulnerable.

02:51.152 --> 02:53.153
(all murmuring positively)

02:53.187 --> 02:54.487
Yeah, and that's not all.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.356
Why don't you tell 'em
about it, Moe?

02:56.390 --> 02:58.425
Yeah, you got it, Moe.

02:58.459 --> 03:01.027
We can make up superhero drink
names and charge 'em double.

03:01.062 --> 03:02.829
Like, uh, Nick Fury,
Agent of Schnapps;

03:02.863 --> 03:04.664
Sex in the Batmobile;

03:04.699 --> 03:05.832

03:34.462 --> 03:36.162
No, no, no!

03:36.197 --> 03:38.531
Why do they call this
a yard of ale?

03:38.566 --> 03:39.966
Easy. After you drink one,

03:40.001 --> 03:41.701
you're passed out
in your yard.

03:41.736 --> 03:42.969
Hmm.

04:00.087 --> 04:03.323
The delightfulness
ended hours ago.

04:03.357 --> 04:05.859
Homer, the best thing
for you to do

04:05.893 --> 04:08.728
in this situation
is keep drinking. Heh.

04:12.967 --> 04:15.869
(Homer moaning)

04:15.903 --> 04:17.904
(groaning)

04:17.938 --> 04:20.040

04:20.074 --> 04:23.343
Oh, why are you doing this
to me, booze?

04:23.377 --> 04:26.046
I drank
every kind of you!

04:26.080 --> 04:27.447
See ya, Homer!
Bye, Dad!

04:27.481 --> 04:29.683
Have a good day,
you two!

04:29.717 --> 04:31.551
Don't be me!

04:38.025 --> 04:40.093
There's my dad!

04:41.529 --> 04:44.130
Wait, I think
I just sucked up a dollar!

04:44.165 --> 04:45.665

04:46.734 --> 04:48.134

04:49.870 --> 04:51.471

04:55.710 --> 04:57.377
Oh! Art.

04:57.411 --> 04:59.379
Simpson! Smock up!

04:59.413 --> 05:01.181
Every time I do art,

05:01.215 --> 05:03.216
some do-gooder teacher sends it
straight to a therapist.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.652
Your stuff is
pretty disturbing.

05:05.686 --> 05:07.854
I've never acted
on any of it.

05:07.888 --> 05:10.090
You will take art,
you will enjoy art,

05:10.124 --> 05:13.426
and you will make something
in a kiln your mother can use.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.030
Oh... (groans)

05:19.533 --> 05:21.901
Maggie!
Why'd you do that?

05:24.638 --> 05:28.641
Oh, I just came in
to take out the trash!

05:28.676 --> 05:31.244
And you shall leave immortal!

05:31.278 --> 05:33.146
Also, take out the trash.

05:34.115 --> 05:35.115
Honest!

05:35.149 --> 05:36.883
Inspiring!

05:36.917 --> 05:39.185
Yes... necessary!

05:39.220 --> 05:41.788
Oh, Milhouse-ian!

05:41.822 --> 05:44.958
Oh, Bart,
it's wonderful!

05:44.992 --> 05:46.526
Really? Wonderful?
I just drowned

05:46.560 --> 05:47.727
a grasshopper in paint

05:47.762 --> 05:49.796
and let him crawl on the paper
till he died.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.064
You know
what that's called?

05:51.098 --> 05:53.533
Mixed-media conceptual art.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.702
No, it's not,
because I hate art.

05:55.736 --> 05:57.804
Oh, then it's protest art!

05:57.838 --> 05:59.539
Stop encouraging me!

05:59.573 --> 06:02.409
I will admire you
from afar...!

06:02.443 --> 06:03.676
(exasperated grunt)

06:03.711 --> 06:05.478
(gasps)

06:08.516 --> 06:10.583
Shauna?
What are you doing here?

06:10.618 --> 06:13.052
Training for the Olympics.

06:13.087 --> 06:16.122
I gotta find a way
to get rid of my art teacher.

06:16.157 --> 06:17.724
Easy. Voodoo.

06:17.758 --> 06:19.726
Is there a voodoo queen
you can direct me to?

06:19.760 --> 06:22.562
Oh, yeah. She lives in a trailer
down by Yogurtland.

06:22.596 --> 06:23.563
Now kiss me.

06:23.597 --> 06:25.198
I wanna make
somebody mad.

06:25.232 --> 06:26.433
(grunting)

06:26.467 --> 06:27.901
What are you doing?!

06:27.935 --> 06:30.470
What's my no-good
daughter up to now?

06:33.441 --> 06:36.609
Now u have everyt'ing
you need for the voodoo.

06:36.644 --> 06:38.244
Would you like a bag?

06:38.279 --> 06:39.145
Yes, ma'am.

06:39.180 --> 06:41.881
Paper or plastic?

06:41.916 --> 06:43.483
Uh, plastic.

06:43.517 --> 06:46.386
Just like the chicken foot say
you would!

06:53.627 --> 06:55.562
Okay, did you get
Trunch's DNA?

06:55.596 --> 06:58.031
Yeah, got it out
of her purse.

06:58.065 --> 06:59.432
(chuckles)

06:59.467 --> 07:00.567
How'd you do that?

07:00.601 --> 07:02.469
Art teachers
don't have a desk.

07:02.503 --> 07:05.305
They just throw
their purse anywhere.

07:06.140 --> 07:09.075
Voodoo spell, voodoo spell,

07:09.109 --> 07:11.611
seagull beak and bone of Mel,

07:11.645 --> 07:13.580
purple heart and tear of chum...

07:13.614 --> 07:14.614
(grunts)

07:15.649 --> 07:18.918
Just had to be
tear of chum.

07:18.953 --> 07:22.388
Send her home
with aching tum!

07:24.592 --> 07:27.794
Oh, right, we need one more
thing from her purse.

07:27.828 --> 07:29.395
I've got these.

07:29.430 --> 07:33.066
Hmm, she's got tickets
to the play <i>God of Carnage.</i>

07:33.100 --> 07:34.334
Orchestra?!

07:34.368 --> 07:36.302
On an art teacher's salary?

07:36.337 --> 07:38.605
That's black magic!

07:38.639 --> 07:40.607
Where's Mrs. Trunch?

07:40.641 --> 07:42.575
I need to know the correct
density of "points"

07:42.610 --> 07:44.410
in my pointillism.

07:44.445 --> 07:47.380
Mm, sorry,
but I don't think

07:47.414 --> 07:50.083
we'll be seeing much
of Trunch today.

07:50.117 --> 07:51.918
Yep, I cast
a voodoo spell on her.

07:51.952 --> 07:53.586
I won't bore you
with the dark details,

07:53.621 --> 07:56.723
but let's just say she's
in no condition for teaching.

07:56.757 --> 07:57.724
(gasps)

07:57.758 --> 07:58.725
(disappointed):
Oh...

07:58.759 --> 08:00.693
Class, I have an announcement.

08:00.728 --> 08:04.731
I'm afraid I can't teach today.
I have a tummy ache.

08:04.765 --> 08:05.732
Mm...

08:05.766 --> 08:08.034
A very special tummy ache.

08:09.003 --> 08:11.137
I'm going
to have a baby!

08:11.171 --> 08:12.305
(gasps)

08:12.339 --> 08:15.508
Aah! Bart Simpson got
a teacher pregnant!

08:15.543 --> 08:17.510
(scoffing)
Typical Ralph nonsense.

08:17.545 --> 08:18.511
(Milhouse panting)

08:18.546 --> 08:21.514
Bart Simpson got
a teacher pregnant!

08:21.549 --> 08:25.151
You happy with your
two-timing boyfriend now?

08:31.668 --> 08:34.336
I admit, I did make
a voodoo doll of Mrs. Trunch.

08:34.370 --> 08:37.039
But I just asked for
a stomachache, not a baby!

08:37.073 --> 08:40.075
Classic wish-maker's mistake:
vague language.

08:40.109 --> 08:41.743
So I <i>did</i> make her pregnant?

08:41.778 --> 08:43.745
Of course not.
Doesn't work that way.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.747
Just how <i>do</i> women get babies?

08:45.782 --> 08:48.116
I'm not allowed to discuss
that with fourth-graders.

08:48.151 --> 08:50.085
Fifth grade, you get
every dirty detail.

08:50.119 --> 08:52.487
Do you know how
embarrassed I was

08:52.522 --> 08:54.723
to get a call
at my arraignment

08:54.757 --> 08:56.558
for my behavior
during the pub crawl

08:56.592 --> 08:58.026
because of a
voodoo curse

08:58.061 --> 09:00.095
my son placed
on his art teacher?

09:00.129 --> 09:02.030
I didn't mean
to make her pregnant.

09:02.065 --> 09:03.765
I just hate art so much.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.233
Oh, everyone does, son.

09:05.268 --> 09:07.202
That's why they
lock it up in museums

09:07.236 --> 09:08.837
where no one
will ever visit.

09:10.206 --> 09:13.508
So, uh, your boy's got magic
knock-up powers, huh?

09:13.543 --> 09:15.577
Hey, I created three kids,

09:15.611 --> 09:17.713
and no one's making a big deal
of that.

09:17.747 --> 09:19.881
Not true! Whenever
I compliment your virility,

09:19.916 --> 09:21.116
you act all weird.

09:21.150 --> 09:23.452
And you are
<i>very</i> virile.

09:23.486 --> 09:25.187
Uh, yeah.
Just talk about sports!

09:25.221 --> 09:26.455
No problem.

09:26.489 --> 09:28.957
Wish I had
that Tom Brady's libido.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.692
(shudders)

09:30.727 --> 09:33.428
Oh, it's amazing how many
Cheerios Maggie drops

09:33.463 --> 09:35.197
in the back seat.

09:35.231 --> 09:37.065
Here you go.
Put those in the trash,

09:37.100 --> 09:40.102
then you can help me
unload the dishwasher.

09:40.136 --> 09:43.038
Oh! A minute of fun,
a lifetime of work.

09:43.072 --> 09:45.240
I've never heard
of a pregnancy like this.

09:45.274 --> 09:46.375
There he is.

09:46.409 --> 09:47.709
Jenny, this is crazy.

09:47.744 --> 09:49.478
Nothing's crazy
at this point.

09:49.512 --> 09:51.880
Are you the boy
that makes babies?

09:51.914 --> 09:55.050
I like to think I'm the boy
that makes families.

09:55.084 --> 09:56.718
You see, Jenny?
He's just a jerk kid.

09:56.753 --> 09:59.020
It's just... (sobs)

09:59.055 --> 10:01.223
we've been trying so hard
to start a family.

10:01.257 --> 10:03.892
With all the money
we've spent on IVF....

10:03.926 --> 10:06.194
(sobs)
You have no idea!

10:06.229 --> 10:08.063
Hmm, maybe I can help.

10:08.097 --> 10:09.264
But it'll cost you.

10:09.298 --> 10:10.165
How much?

10:10.199 --> 10:11.233
Five dollars.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.435
Plus one dollar
haw-haw insurance.

10:13.469 --> 10:15.570
Trust me,
the insurance is worth it.

10:18.274 --> 10:20.409
By the power of this place,

10:20.443 --> 10:22.277
make a baby with a face.

10:22.311 --> 10:23.311
That's great, really.

10:23.346 --> 10:24.713
Really glad
we're getting a baby

10:24.747 --> 10:26.014
with a face.
Thank you.

10:26.048 --> 10:27.849
(tires screech)

10:27.884 --> 10:29.050
Haw...!

10:29.085 --> 10:30.685
No haw-haw!
It worked!

10:30.720 --> 10:31.520
(groans)

10:31.554 --> 10:32.587
I'm pregnant!

10:32.622 --> 10:33.755
Look, Bart, I really,

10:33.790 --> 10:35.357
I can't believe
there's a connection here.

10:35.391 --> 10:37.025
But, uh, we have some friends

10:37.059 --> 10:39.127
who are in the same
dark place that we were.

10:39.162 --> 10:40.429
Can we give them your name?

10:40.463 --> 10:42.330
Only if they have five dollars.

10:42.365 --> 10:45.033
Yes, right. I'll make sure
that they have five dollars.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.201
<i>With</i> them.

10:46.235 --> 10:47.636
Look, I'm sorry
our check bounced, man.

10:47.670 --> 10:49.304
I can have
the bank teller call you.

10:49.338 --> 10:52.441
Just give me the cash and you'll
get your driver's license back.

10:52.475 --> 10:54.509
Please keep the chatter down

10:54.544 --> 10:57.379
while the Womb Wizard
is casting his spells.

10:57.413 --> 10:59.714
Ones are appreciated, people.

11:01.484 --> 11:04.319
Barbeque sauce
and teddy bear's eye.

11:04.353 --> 11:06.922
They want a baby,
God knows why.

11:09.492 --> 11:11.393
Homie, I can't find my spatula.

11:11.427 --> 11:12.694
Can you get another one?

11:12.728 --> 11:15.130
Flanders, can we borrow
your spatula?

11:15.164 --> 11:16.665
That was my spatula.

11:16.699 --> 11:18.633
And you never bought
a replacement?

11:18.668 --> 11:20.101
Ah, too much aggravation.

11:20.136 --> 11:21.770
We just forego flipped food.

11:21.804 --> 11:22.804
D'oh!

11:22.839 --> 11:24.739
(grunts)

11:24.774 --> 11:25.807
Hmm.

11:25.842 --> 11:26.908
(humming a tune)
Bart?

11:26.943 --> 11:28.276
Huh?

11:28.311 --> 11:29.778
Why, you little...!

11:29.812 --> 11:31.947
I'll teach you to answer
peoples' prayers!

11:31.981 --> 11:33.982
(both grunting)

11:36.185 --> 11:38.520
Yeah, you know,
I just don't think

11:38.554 --> 11:40.956
we're going to get
in to see him today.

11:42.859 --> 11:45.193
What is your problem, boy?

11:45.228 --> 11:47.529
Maybe when I've got a dad
who shows up in the morning

11:47.563 --> 11:49.998
with no shirt on and
rocks on his face,

11:50.032 --> 11:52.501
it sets, I don't know,
a low bar?

11:52.535 --> 11:54.469
Wow, I got to take that in.

11:54.504 --> 11:55.904
While I do,
have some bar nuts.

11:55.938 --> 11:57.506
Aren't those full of germs?

11:57.540 --> 11:59.274
Eat the nuts!
They're your dinner!

11:59.308 --> 12:01.309
(guns click)

12:01.344 --> 12:03.345
You guys
are coming with us.

12:05.014 --> 12:07.015
Not so fast!

12:07.049 --> 12:10.986
Nobody comes into my bar and
kidnaps two paying customers.

12:11.020 --> 12:13.021
Aw, thanks, Moe, I...

12:13.055 --> 12:14.122
Huh?

12:14.156 --> 12:16.057
I must've left
my wallet at home.

12:16.092 --> 12:17.292
All right, take them, take them!

12:17.326 --> 12:18.293
Fill their pockets with corn

12:18.327 --> 12:19.661
and toss them to the pigs.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.997
Don't tell us our business!

12:22.965 --> 12:24.065
(sobs)

12:30.606 --> 12:32.107
Huh? Fat Tony?

12:32.141 --> 12:33.441
That's right...

12:33.476 --> 12:35.677
Fat Homer.
Hey!

12:35.711 --> 12:38.346
I need your boy
to make a baby.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.635
Do you really need the boy's
help to make a baby?

12:41.651 --> 12:43.518
Just do a little
of the bunga-bunga,

12:43.553 --> 12:45.320
and the hotsie-totsie,

12:45.354 --> 12:46.955
and the bop-bada-
bop-bada-bop.

12:46.989 --> 12:50.392
You sound like every doctor
I've ever been to.

12:50.426 --> 12:51.860
But it's not for me.

12:51.894 --> 12:53.595
It's for her.

12:53.629 --> 12:56.064
Meet my filly, Cheesesteak.

12:56.098 --> 12:57.966
The love of my life.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.034
(baby-talking, kissing)

12:59.068 --> 13:00.702
Who has apple breath?

13:00.736 --> 13:02.571
You has apple breath.

13:02.605 --> 13:03.672
(kissing, baby-talking)

13:05.875 --> 13:07.075
And this horse,

13:07.109 --> 13:08.843
who I have briefly "borrowed,"

13:08.878 --> 13:11.446
is the winner of last year's
Springfield Stakes--

13:11.480 --> 13:13.415
Rear Admiral.

13:13.449 --> 13:16.918
So work your magic,
and breed me a champion.

13:16.953 --> 13:18.119
Look, Fat Tony,

13:18.154 --> 13:19.654
I don't know
what you know about voodoo,

13:19.689 --> 13:21.456
but it only works on people.

13:21.490 --> 13:22.557
Horses?

13:22.592 --> 13:23.858
That's crazy talk!

13:23.893 --> 13:26.695
You will breed me a
champion by morning

13:26.729 --> 13:30.098
or it will be the last
sunrise you ever see.

13:30.132 --> 13:31.333
Don't over-promise, boss.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.934
It might be overcast.

13:32.969 --> 13:35.470
How'd you like a
cast over your face?

13:35.504 --> 13:38.740
Well, as long as there
re breath holes.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.009
You know, I'm just saying.

13:42.144 --> 13:43.712
Okay, boy, if there ever was

13:43.746 --> 13:45.347
a good time for you to find out

13:45.381 --> 13:46.414
where babies come from

13:46.449 --> 13:48.049
in the grossest way possible,

13:48.084 --> 13:49.250
with your life on the line,

13:49.285 --> 13:50.418
this is it.

13:50.453 --> 13:52.187
One more thing:

13:52.221 --> 13:54.222
It better be a boy.

13:54.256 --> 13:56.324
(scoffs)
Anything else?

13:56.359 --> 13:58.259
It would be helpful
if he could go undercover

13:58.294 --> 14:01.162
with police horses
and find out what they know.

14:07.406 --> 14:09.707
(crickets trilling)

14:09.741 --> 14:11.442
Hey, this is all your fault.

14:11.477 --> 14:12.844
How is it my fault?

14:12.878 --> 14:15.279
I wouldn't be here if you
were more of a role model.

14:15.314 --> 14:18.282
Pub crawls,
naked Frisbee golf...

14:18.317 --> 14:22.286
I just did that because it was
a series of funny words.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.855
Well, it's your
mediocre fathering

14:23.889 --> 14:26.123
that put me on
the path to hell!

14:26.158 --> 14:27.124
Wha...?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.359
Maybe you're right, boy.

14:28.393 --> 14:30.094
It's time I was a better father.

14:30.128 --> 14:32.196
And I'll start by saving us.

14:32.231 --> 14:34.031
I just need to facilitate

14:34.066 --> 14:35.466
some horse intercourse.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.301
Come on, buddy.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.237
Just make a champion
thoroughbred,

14:39.271 --> 14:40.671
and we're out of here.

14:40.706 --> 14:43.307

Big deal.

15:01.727 --> 15:03.160
