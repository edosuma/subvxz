Black thorns and roses...

00:26.160 --> 00:27.500
..smiles and tears.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.160
They're sown together

00:31.200 --> 00:33.120

01:40.870 --> 01:43.160
-I win.
-All right.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.450
Come. Let's go back.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.500
Oh, relax.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.790
Sergey?

01:47.830 --> 01:49.540
Sergey?
SHE CHUCKLES

01:49.580 --> 01:50.910
Enjoy yourself for once.

01:50.950 --> 01:52.450
One more time. Please.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.580
Race you to the rocks.

01:53.620 --> 01:56.250
OK, but you're
going to lose again. Ready?

01:56.290 --> 01:58.580
VEHICLE APPROACHES

02:00.660 --> 02:02.160

02:09.040 --> 02:10.870

02:15.370 --> 02:18.040

02:20.370 --> 02:21.580
Sidorov?

02:23.870 --> 02:25.080
You again.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.250
Kurilka, 0900 hours.

Oh! Volodja.

02:46.410 --> 02:49.120
Sergeant Popov's easy.
Two packs of cigarettes.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.450
Life's about who you know.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.950
We can't all have
your connections.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.500
You could have my connections,
Luisa. You could have them all.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.660
Oh! Oh, bloody rocks!

02:56.700 --> 02:58.290

04:39.750 --> 04:41.540
Attention.

04:41.580 --> 04:42.620
At ease.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.910
Comrade Colonel, second
squadron ready to manoeuvre.

06:05.370 --> 06:07.370
You know, one day the colonel

06:07.410 --> 06:10.040
is going to open his
flight reports

06:10.080 --> 06:12.040
and find your
human-anatomy diagrams.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.750
It's the hardest exam.

06:16.950 --> 06:19.450
Then one more to go -
scientific communism.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.330
I'm not going to have a life.

06:21.370 --> 06:23.660
It'll be worth it in the end.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.700
Let's do the morning report.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.410
HE CLEARS THROAT

06:37.330 --> 06:39.290
You won't reconsider
the colonel's offer?

06:40.660 --> 06:42.120
Give me one good reason.

06:45.750 --> 06:46.910
Two good reasons.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.830
You could make
a career for yourself here,

06:52.870 --> 06:55.200
rather than stack hay
in the middle of nowhere.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.410
What else is there?

07:12.700 --> 07:14.750
Sergey. Luisa. Wait.

07:14.790 --> 07:17.830
Sergey, take our photograph,
for posterity.

07:17.870 --> 07:18.950
Not again.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.290
-I'm going to the canteen.
-Please.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.620
Smile in this one.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.790
Comrade Lieutenant.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.120
We were ordered to take
this photograph

07:34.160 --> 07:35.290
for the weekly journal.

07:36.950 --> 07:38.410
At ease.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.120
Let me take one of all of you.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.370
Move to your right.

08:05.790 --> 08:07.580
Which way to
the commander's office?

08:07.620 --> 08:09.580
Comrade Lieutenant,
I'll show you.

08:14.910 --> 08:18.160
Since the Nato forces increased
surveillance of our border,

08:18.200 --> 08:21.620
I've got four Migs up in
the air around the clock.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.330
We now assume each B-52
is carrying

08:24.370 --> 08:26.290
several
thermonuclear devices.

08:26.330 --> 08:29.080
Should just one slip through,

08:29.120 --> 08:33.000
they will be on the direct
air corridor to Leningrad.

08:33.040 --> 08:37.000
It will be your duty to prevent
this from happening.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.450
Understood?

08:38.500 --> 08:39.750
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.540
Welcome, Lieutenant Matvejev.

08:45.910 --> 08:47.290
Dismissed.

08:50.620 --> 08:51.790
Send him in.

08:56.580 --> 08:58.700
So, young man,

08:58.750 --> 09:01.660
I hear you have declined
my offer to stay on.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.290
What are your plans?

09:04.330 --> 09:06.410
I will return home to find
work, Comrade Colonel.

09:09.330 --> 09:11.040
Very well.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.910
Take the Uazik and drive
the lieutenant

09:12.950 --> 09:14.370
to the officers' block.

09:14.410 --> 09:16.290
You'll be receiving some
additional duties

09:16.330 --> 09:17.950
in your final weeks.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.160
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.870

09:20.910 --> 09:22.080

09:24.410 --> 09:25.750
Yes, Comrade Major.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.790
No, he has not returned.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.910
I will report immediately,
Comrade Major.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Here.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.200
I'm afraid there are
no facilities

10:17.250 --> 10:20.040
to develop photographs here,
Comrade Lieutenant.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.410
Now there are.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.790
You develop photographs too?

10:24.830 --> 10:26.200
Yes, I do.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.000
I'll finish it myself.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.200
Yes, Comrade Lieutenant.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.660
Permission to leave?

10:32.700 --> 10:34.580
Granted.

10:34.620 --> 10:35.660
Private.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.040
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.950
Matvejev.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.750
Graduating with first-class
honours, eh?

11:33.790 --> 11:36.410
Don't they say those who
do well at flight school

11:36.450 --> 11:39.910
have problems handling their
equipment in the sky?

11:39.950 --> 11:42.080
I was told that one particular
pilot here

11:42.120 --> 11:44.540
has problems in
that department.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.830
Time will tell.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.660
Shit! Volkov is on duty
tonight.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.290
He woke up the second
unit at 0300 hours

12:10.330 --> 12:12.750
because he found a cigarette
butt outside their barracks.

12:12.790 --> 12:16.250
He made them run 10km
into the forest, dig it a grave

12:16.290 --> 12:18.580
and give it a full burial
with honours.

12:18.620 --> 12:19.830

Kissed my chances goodbye.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.200
Now I see why she didn't
come swimming with us.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.580
What's the matter with you?

13:09.620 --> 13:12.120
I told you. "Like a sister"?

13:12.160 --> 13:13.540
You are in love.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.500
Sergey, do something about it.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.040
Before it's too late.

13:21.290 --> 13:24.540
The safety of the squadron
is paramount.

13:24.580 --> 13:27.120
There will come a day when you
have to choose between

13:27.160 --> 13:30.700
missing your target or
saving your wingman's life.

13:31.830 --> 13:34.580
There's a fine line between
bravery and recklessness.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.080
Tomorrow, we will proceed

13:38.120 --> 13:40.080

attack scenario.

At ease.

Is Luisa here?

13:54.040 --> 13:56.830
No, she went to human
resources, Comrade Lieutenant.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.950
That's fine.
I'll come by later.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.790
Comrade Lieutenant...

14:01.830 --> 14:03.500
permission to ask you
a question.

14:05.330 --> 14:08.080
Would you have time to develop
some photographs later?

14:13.410 --> 14:14.910
You're too soft.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.830
Harder. Harder.
Not one spot left.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.790
A love letter from another
admirer of yours.

14:25.830 --> 14:26.950
It's been opened again.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.450
Mm. Must be such a fun job,

14:28.500 --> 14:30.620
reading all the thrilling
letters from your mother.

14:32.410 --> 14:35.080
Come on. We're playing
durak in the Lenin room.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.000
Sergey.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.750
Get out of your fantasy world.

14:40.790 --> 14:41.830
Maybe later.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.620
NEARBY CHATTER

15:23.000 --> 15:24.830
Take it by the corner...

15:27.200 --> 15:29.040
..and gently...

15:31.580 --> 15:33.580
..place it in the water tray.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.200
Like this, Comrade Lieutenant?

15:53.250 --> 15:54.370
That's better.

15:55.910 --> 15:57.290
And call me Roman.

16:02.410 --> 16:03.580
You...

16:03.620 --> 16:05.540
really see other people,
Sergey.

16:09.290 --> 16:12.790
You capture their essence,
their soul.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.250
I search for
something deeper...

16:21.540 --> 16:23.450
..but I can't quite grasp it.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.410
How do you mean?

16:35.700 --> 16:36.910
When you take a photo...

16:39.750 --> 16:42.700
..there's something in
that very moment

16:42.750 --> 16:44.200
which is gone forever.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.540
A moment that will never
be there again.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.410
Like a ghost
escaping this world.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.620

17:02.290 --> 17:03.660

melting with his anger.

You'd better sleep it off here.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.370
No, I-I can't...

18:30.410 --> 18:33.870
I'll tell the duty officer that
I needed you at the hangar.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.660
No, no, no. I have to go.

invisible bond between us.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.160
We'd write secret letters to
each other

23:53.200 --> 23:55.080
and sign them Valentin.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.290
-Valentin?
-Zubkov.

23:58.330 --> 24:00.750
The fighter pilot who
became an actor.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.540
We wanted to be just like him.

24:05.370 --> 24:06.950
We even promised we'd go to

24:07.000 --> 24:09.080
the same drama school
in Moscow together.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.250
What happened?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.700
It was just a silly dream.

24:31.620 --> 24:32.620
What will you do

24:32.660 --> 24:34.290
after you leave the base?

24:34.330 --> 24:36.620
Go back to the farm,

24:36.660 --> 24:39.200
support my mother, find work.

24:39.250 --> 24:42.160
Couldn't you support her even
better if you studied in Moscow

24:42.200 --> 24:44.120
and got a job at Mosfilm?

24:44.160 --> 24:45.450
I'd never get in.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.160
How do you know?

24:47.200 --> 24:50.040
Because they only take 20
people from across the country.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.450
There are hundreds of
conscripts here

24:53.500 --> 24:55.700
but the colonel chose you.

24:58.120 --> 25:02.160
"It is not in the stars to hold
our destiny, but in ourselves."

25:07.200 --> 25:08.370
Shakespeare.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.160
Pull over.
This could take a while.

25:22.870 --> 25:24.000
Look.

25:25.330 --> 25:27.000
They're dancing with
each other.

25:33.540 --> 25:34.790
Oh. Shit.

25:34.830 --> 25:36.870
SERGEY SPITS AND COUGHS

25:36.910 --> 25:38.750
That definitely wasn't
a blueberry.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.540
Do you have a girl back home?

25:52.080 --> 25:53.160
No.

25:54.950 --> 25:55.950
Do you?

25:58.580 --> 26:00.000
VEHICLE APPROACHES

26:02.040 --> 26:04.080
Shit! Border guards.

28:00.830 --> 28:02.700
What happened to you
last night?

28:02.750 --> 28:04.330
I thought you were going to go
after her,

28:04.370 --> 28:05.620
not ignore her even more.

28:06.790 --> 28:08.450
I had to drive the lieutenant.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.910
That late? We waited for you.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.950
Luisa kept going on and on
about him,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.700
so I told her to stop

28:15.750 --> 28:18.370
and then she got mad at me
and went home.

28:18.410 --> 28:19.870
Where did you drive him?

28:19.910 --> 28:22.120
He went to the theatre.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.330
And then?

28:27.660 --> 28:29.410
Then we were delayed
coming back.

28:32.620 --> 28:34.830
-What?
-Sergey, you've got that look.

28:34.870 --> 28:36.580
No, really. I was on duty.

28:36.620 --> 28:38.700
You've found another girl,
haven't you?

28:38.750 --> 28:40.330
Tell me, who is she?

28:40.370 --> 28:42.450
Swap, anyone?

28:42.500 --> 28:44.080
Kolja, I'll swap with you.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.750
Yes, Sergey.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.330
Come on, Sergey.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.830
-So, how is he?
-Who?

28:52.870 --> 28:54.330
Lieutenant Matvejev.

28:56.950 --> 28:58.370
Not like the other officers.

29:01.750 --> 29:02.870
That's what I thought.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.700
I have to drive him
to Tallinn this weekend.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.450
What do you think?
Where should I take him?

29:11.540 --> 29:12.870
Erm...

29:12.910 --> 29:14.540
I could come and show
him around,

29:14.580 --> 29:16.540
if Lieutenant Matvejev
doesn't mind.

29:17.830 --> 29:18.830
Yeah?

29:18.870 --> 29:20.250
-Yeah.
-Of course.

29:20.290 --> 29:22.040
SOLDIER WHISTLES

29:25.330 --> 29:28.620
Stalin is standing in this
field, a green field,

29:28.660 --> 29:32.120
and there's this farmer nearby,
and Stalin...

29:32.160 --> 29:33.290
No, the farmer...

29:33.330 --> 29:35.540
If you insist on telling it,
at least do it properly.

29:35.580 --> 29:36.660
Dick.

29:38.450 --> 29:42.620
A farm worker greets Josef
Stalin at his potato farm.

29:42.660 --> 29:45.370
"Comrade Stalin,
we have so many potatoes that,

29:45.410 --> 29:46.700
"piled one on top of
the other

29:46.750 --> 29:48.580
"they would reach
all the way to God,"

29:48.620 --> 29:50.160
the farmer excitedly tells...

29:56.120 --> 29:58.910
Go on, Private Serebrennikov.

30:01.290 --> 30:02.620
Go on. I love a good joke.

30:05.660 --> 30:07.200
Go on.

30:12.290 --> 30:14.160
"But God does not exist,"
replies Stalin.

30:15.370 --> 30:16.830
"Exactly," says the farmer.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.410
"Neither do the potatoes."

30:25.790 --> 30:28.000
HE CHUCKLES

30:29.580 --> 30:32.040
"Neither do the potatoes."

30:33.950 --> 30:35.290
That's a good one.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.580
Follow me.

30:59.450 --> 31:01.950
Telling jokes of that nature
could interfere greatly

31:02.000 --> 31:03.950
with your future prospects.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.500
We have immense responsibility
for how we affect society.

31:09.250 --> 31:12.120
So I'd choose more carefully
which stories you tell.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.250
This will never happen again,
Comrade Major.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.330
I do hope so.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.160
For your own sake.

31:20.450 --> 31:21.750
One more thing.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.040
According to
the orderly's logbook,

31:26.080 --> 31:30.120
on your trip to Tallinn, you
returned the Uazik at 22:34.

31:33.910 --> 31:36.290
What was the cause of
such a delay?

31:36.330 --> 31:38.700
The lieutenant was attending
the theatre, Comrade Major.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.500
We were delayed at
the crossing at Risti.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.330
The gates were broken again.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.250
I did everything I could to
return as quickly as possible.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.290
Whom did he attend
the theatre with?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.830
The lieutenant was alone,
Comrade Major.

32:00.870 --> 32:01.870
I see.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.580
You will report to me

32:09.620 --> 32:12.160
if you notice anything
outside the ordinary.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.200
Understood?

32:13.250 --> 32:14.660
Yes, Comrade Major.

32:17.620 --> 32:18.700
Dismissed.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.160
And the Oleviste church

32:56.200 --> 32:58.370

in medieval Europe.

32:59.790 --> 33:02.910

under Mary's chapel.

33:07.540 --> 33:08.830
Sorry.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.370
Thank you.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.450

33:44.200 --> 33:46.910

pair of boots made.

33:46.950 --> 33:48.000

33:49.250 --> 33:51.250
-Olga.
-Luisa.

33:57.700 --> 33:58.700
Hello.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.410
Which one of these handsome

34:02.450 --> 34:04.830
-Olga!
-Don't tell me.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.540
This one's your husband, hm?

34:06.580 --> 34:09.080
And this must be your brother.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.500
Olga, these are my colleagues
from the base.

34:12.540 --> 34:13.870
-Oh.
-Yeah.

34:13.910 --> 34:14.910
Colleagues.

34:16.410 --> 34:18.410
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.250
-He's so sweet. It's your baby?
-Yes.

What lines?

37:53.750 --> 37:55.000

38:02.870 --> 38:04.160

38:05.290 --> 38:06.450
I'm going to be an actor.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.290
One more thing.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.410
Lieutenant Matvejev,

39:44.450 --> 39:48.910
are you familiar with Article
154A of the Criminal Code?

39:48.950 --> 39:50.410
No, Comrade Major. I'm not.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.700
Sexual relations of a man
with another man,

39:55.750 --> 39:58.540
which is punishable by
five years' imprisonment

39:58.580 --> 40:00.000
in a hard-labour camp.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.700
I'm not following,
Comrade Major.

40:07.330 --> 40:10.290
A report has been received
implying you have engaged in

40:10.330 --> 40:12.160
immoral conduct
with a private.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.290
This is malicious gossip.

40:13.330 --> 40:14.700
Lieutenant Matvejev...

40:17.700 --> 40:20.580
I wouldn't recommend
you interrupt me again.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.660
There was no name of
the private in question.

40:30.370 --> 40:31.580
Give me his name.

40:35.370 --> 40:37.000
There is no name to give.

40:38.290 --> 40:39.290
It is a lie.

40:39.330 --> 40:40.410
I assure you, comrades.

40:40.450 --> 40:43.080
Consider your words,
Lieutenant Matvejev.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.290
Comrade Major...

40:47.660 --> 40:49.200
..who wrote this?

40:49.250 --> 40:52.410
It was delivered anonymously,
unsigned.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.450
Without honour.

40:55.660 --> 40:57.370
I trust the lieutenant's word.

40:58.450 --> 40:59.500
Dismissed.

41:02.910 --> 41:04.370
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

41:04.410 --> 41:05.450

41:09.160 --> 41:10.250
It would be a pity.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.870

41:21.910 --> 41:23.370
what do you get for free?

I have no idea.

I have a good one, too.

41:28.870 --> 41:30.580

41:40.870 --> 41:42.330
Listen to me and don't react.

All stations, we have
an emergency.

43:23.910 --> 43:26.290
011, drop your weapons

43:26.330 --> 43:28.830

43:31.330 --> 43:32.500

43:32.540 --> 43:36.200
That gives him
a range of 73km.

43:36.250 --> 43:37.910
He'll crash
at least 10km short.

I can save the plane.
I can fly it at stall speed.

Damn it, he's trying to land.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.790
Matvejev, it's too risky.

43:50.830 --> 43:52.830
I need you to return alive.

43:52.870 --> 43:54.790
Eject. That's an order.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.200

Serebrennikov, let's go.

45:45.450 --> 45:47.830
You! You! You!
Get him out of there!

46:16.620 --> 46:19.910
All clear, Lieutenant Matvejev.

46:19.950 --> 46:22.370
You were very lucky today.
Get some rest.

So you won't forget me.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.540
We could get the training plane
and fly to Sweden.

49:55.750 --> 49:56.830
Sweden?

49:58.540 --> 50:00.620
Why Sweden?

50:00.660 --> 50:02.410
I don't know.

50:02.450 --> 50:03.500
I don't care...

50:04.700 --> 50:06.410
..as long as we're together.

50:06.450 --> 50:08.000
Sergey, I'm an officer.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.830
I can't leave my motherland.

50:25.040 --> 50:29.080
If you get into drama school...

50:30.750 --> 50:33.410
..I'll find something to do
in Moscow, too.

50:39.660 --> 50:42.290
And then we could go to the
cinema whenever we wanted.

50:44.660 --> 50:47.580
And take a cruise on the river

50:47.620 --> 50:50.830
and watch all the shows
at the Bolshoi.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.410
And have an ice cream on Arbat,

50:54.450 --> 50:57.120
and then throw up on
the American Mountains.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.580
That's decided, then.

All right, then.

At ease.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.080
Sounds like you're
having fun in here.

51:27.120 --> 51:30.620
Just analysing my flight
report, Comrade Major.

51:35.540 --> 51:36.910
Alone?

51:36.950 --> 51:38.080
Yes, Comrade Major.

51:40.870 --> 51:41.910
I see.

52:01.950 --> 52:03.370
Where did you develop these?

52:07.120 --> 52:09.330
Just personal photos,
Comrade Major.

52:10.700 --> 52:12.000
Personal.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.250
Matvejev...

53:22.330 --> 53:24.790
..if there is the slightest
truth in that report...

53:27.660 --> 53:29.450
..believe me, I will find out.

53:30.870 --> 53:34.250
And nobody can protect you
then, not even Kuznetsov.

53:37.080 --> 53:40.330
And I'll personally make sure
that you'll never fly again.

53:43.370 --> 53:44.540
Goodnight.

54:09.370 --> 54:11.330
You better
return to the barracks now.

54:13.330 --> 54:14.870
Make sure nobody sees you.

54:22.910 --> 54:25.450
Faster!

54:25.500 --> 54:27.250
Move it!

54:27.290 --> 54:29.660
Fucking rats.

54:29.700 --> 54:31.200
Move it!

54:31.250 --> 54:33.330
Won't have to listen to him
ever again.

54:33.370 --> 54:34.370
One more day.

54:49.910 --> 54:50.910
Good luck.

55:05.290 --> 55:06.540

55:09.870 --> 55:11.290
Vasja, wait here.

55:11.330 --> 55:13.330
Colonel's orders.

55:13.370 --> 55:14.450
Comrade Lieutenant?

55:16.790 --> 55:18.250
Comrade Lieutenant?

55:18.290 --> 55:19.620
What is it, Private?

55:19.660 --> 55:21.290
I made a plan.

55:21.330 --> 55:22.580
What plan?

55:22.620 --> 55:23.910
For Moscow.

55:23.950 --> 55:26.450
Get back to your station,
Private.

55:26.500 --> 55:27.870
What?

55:27.910 --> 55:29.580
-Last night...
-Listen...

55:29.620 --> 55:32.000
Comrade Serebrennikov.

55:32.040 --> 55:33.540
There was no last night.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.580
Nothing ever happened
between us. Nothing.

55:36.660 --> 55:37.750
Understand?

56:32.750 --> 56:33.790
Moscow?

56:33.830 --> 56:34.910
Moscow is where I'll be.

56:34.950 --> 56:36.580
I'll hold you to that.

56:37.750 --> 56:38.910
Vasja.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.790
Sergey...

56:42.830 --> 56:46.080
don't forget - write to me
after your auditions.

56:46.120 --> 56:47.160
Of course.

57:02.910 --> 57:04.700
Take care.

then this terrible tragedy
would never have happened.

58:16.870 --> 58:19.200
That's love for convenience.
That's not true love.

58:19.250 --> 58:22.500
Oh, really?
And how does true love behave?

58:22.540 --> 58:25.040
You can't stop thinking about
the other person.

58:25.080 --> 58:26.700
You have to be with them
no matter what.

58:26.750 --> 58:28.450
But she could save
both their lives,

58:28.500 --> 58:30.450

meet up in secret.

Not when he's madly in love.

58:51.660 --> 58:53.250
We could practise at my place.

I can't tonight. I have to
practise my monologue.

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.950
Gorko! Gorko! Gorko!

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.830
Gorko! Gorko!

1:06:09.870 --> 1:06:10.870
I tried...

1:06:12.250 --> 1:06:13.410
..so hard...

1:06:14.620 --> 1:06:15.910
..to forget you.

1:06:18.410 --> 1:06:19.450
But I can't.

1:06:21.660 --> 1:06:23.410
-All these months, I...
-Sergey.

1:06:23.450 --> 1:06:25.000
-...waited.
-Sergey.

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:26.250
I thought you'd come.

1:06:28.540 --> 1:06:30.040
I couldn't.

1:06:50.660 --> 1:06:52.120
What are you doing?

1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:01.370
DOOR OPENS

1:07:03.410 --> 1:07:04.410
Comrade Major.

1:07:15.790 --> 1:07:17.660
Your wife is looking for you.

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.450
Thank you, Comrade Major.

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:20.750
I'll be right there.

1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:38.790
I must go, Sergey.

1:07:38.830 --> 1:07:40.620
We could still go
to Moscow together.

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:43.500
Nobody would have to know.

1:07:45.790 --> 1:07:47.790
-Have that ice cream on Arbat.
-Sergey.

1:07:51.290 --> 1:07:52.330
Luisa is...

1:07:53.950 --> 1:07:55.160
..pregnant.

1:08:13.910 --> 1:08:15.540
"You have sense enough",

1:08:15.580 --> 1:08:17.250
said Father Zossima.

1:08:19.290 --> 1:08:21.700
"Don't give way to drunkenness

1:08:21.750 --> 1:08:24.910
"and incontinence of speech.

1:08:24.950 --> 1:08:27.450
"Don't give way to sensual lust

1:08:27.500 --> 1:08:28.910
"and to the love of money.

1:08:30.620 --> 1:08:31.830
"And above all...

1:08:31.870 --> 1:08:34.330
"don't lie."

1:08:34.370 --> 1:08:36.250
"You mean about Diderot?"

1:08:36.290 --> 1:08:39.290
"No, not about Diderot.

1:08:39.330 --> 1:08:42.250
"Above all, don't lie
to yourself.

1:08:44.580 --> 1:08:46.700
"The man who lies to himself...

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:48.830
"and listens to his own lie

1:08:48.870 --> 1:08:50.120
"comes to the point

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:52.410
"that he cannot distinguish
the truth within him..."

1:08:52.450 --> 1:08:53.540
Daddy!

1:08:53.580 --> 1:08:55.330
"..or around him.

1:08:55.370 --> 1:08:59.000
"And so loses all respect for
himself and for others.

1:09:00.250 --> 1:09:02.000
"And having no respect...

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:04.330
"..he ceases to love."

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.750
LUISA: Dinner is ready.

1:09:35.790 --> 1:09:37.200
It won't be a holiday.

1:09:37.250 --> 1:09:38.500
I'll be doing long hours.

1:09:38.540 --> 1:09:40.290
You'd be alone in the city
all day.

1:09:40.330 --> 1:09:43.200
I think it would be
better for you to stay here.

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:45.870
But I don't want
to be stuck here.

1:09:45.910 --> 1:09:47.250
And he'll miss his daddy.

1:09:47.290 --> 1:09:49.450
You have your family here
to help you.

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:51.080
Just for a few months.

1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:52.620
-Did you think about us?
-Yes.

1:09:52.660 --> 1:09:53.660
And?

1:09:53.700 --> 1:09:55.790
When I finish in Moscow,
they'll promote me.

1:09:55.830 --> 1:09:58.080
And we can finally get
a bigger apartment.

1:10:02.370 --> 1:10:04.580
Do I have a say in this?

1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:05.790
It's for the best.

1:10:11.290 --> 1:10:12.830
Have you seen my jumper?

1:10:12.870 --> 1:10:14.000
Which one?

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:15.250
The grey winter one.

1:10:18.290 --> 1:10:20.080
BOY: Why do you have to go?

1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:22.540
Serjozha, I'll see you soon.

1:10:24.830 --> 1:10:26.620
You are both mean.

1:10:26.660 --> 1:10:27.910
Serjozha...

1:10:45.410 --> 1:10:47.830
BANGING

1:10:52.790 --> 1:10:54.500
-This one?
-Yes.

1:10:56.830 --> 1:10:58.250
And that's why I love you.

1:11:04.330 --> 1:11:06.000
I should just make it
to the train.

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.160
See you soon.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.120
Prison, my lord?

1:11:40.660 --> 1:11:42.160
Denmark's a prison.

1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:43.620
Then is the world one?

1:11:44.950 --> 1:11:46.330
A goodly one,

1:11:46.370 --> 1:11:48.500
in which there are many
confines, wards,

1:11:48.540 --> 1:11:51.700
dungeons.
Denmark being one of the worst.

1:11:54.450 --> 1:11:55.830
We think not so, my lord.

1:11:56.950 --> 1:11:58.410
Why, then, 'tis none to you,

1:11:58.450 --> 1:12:00.120
for there is nothing either
good or bad

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:01.410
but thinking makes it so.

1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:05.250
To me...

1:12:05.290 --> 1:12:06.290
it is a prison.

1:12:07.750 --> 1:12:09.750
I'm going to read all his
books during the break.

1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:13.500
That better not be
all you'll be doing.

1:12:13.540 --> 1:12:15.450
I'll make sure it won't be.

1:12:15.500 --> 1:12:18.250
Or I'll throw his books
into the river again.

1:12:19.580 --> 1:12:21.450
Sergey? You have a visitor.

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:36.290
What are you doing here?

1:12:38.700 --> 1:12:41.160
I...came to see your play.

1:12:46.330 --> 1:12:47.330
Did you like it?

1:12:53.620 --> 1:12:55.370
The prince...

1:12:55.410 --> 1:12:56.660
was very good.

1:13:00.870 --> 1:13:01.910
Thank you.

1:13:16.330 --> 1:13:17.330
Sergey...

1:13:18.750 --> 1:13:20.580
I've been sorting out
my apartment,

1:13:20.620 --> 1:13:23.700
so I have a week off
before I start at the academy.

1:13:26.660 --> 1:13:28.040
Why are you telling me this?

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:30.450
Didn't you get my letter?

1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:36.870
How's your wife...

1:13:36.910 --> 1:13:38.000
and your child?

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:40.870
Come to Sochi with me.

1:13:42.290 --> 1:13:43.580
I have two tickets.

1:13:47.790 --> 1:13:49.870
For the 1800 train.

1:13:49.910 --> 1:13:52.370
You think you can just turn up
here and I'll drop my life?

1:13:53.580 --> 1:13:55.330
What was it -
could she not join you?

1:13:56.620 --> 1:13:57.620
Sergey...

1:13:57.660 --> 1:13:58.750
DOOR OPENS

1:14:00.540 --> 1:14:01.830
I'll be right there, Ilya.

1:14:09.870 --> 1:14:11.620
I've got to get back
to my friends.

1:14:16.410 --> 1:14:20.290
Why do you think we use
the classics to teach you?

1:14:21.950 --> 1:14:26.500
Because the characters
of these stories

1:14:26.540 --> 1:14:28.580
are not intellectuals.

1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:33.750
They are living, breathing...

1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:36.660
..feeling beings...

1:14:38.330 --> 1:14:41.450
..whom are tender,

1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:43.330
with tremble...

1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:46.950
..in their hearts.

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.700
And I want you to
catch this tremble

1:14:50.750 --> 1:14:53.750
to your own heart and soul.

1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:03.250
KNOCK AT DOOR

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:06.000
Tea?

1:15:07.330 --> 1:15:09.200
PA: Train 505 for Sochi

1:15:09.250 --> 1:15:11.950
is departing now from
platform two.

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000
TRAIN CLUNKS

1:15:16.870 --> 1:15:19.080
DOOR SLIDES OPEN

1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:02.500
CLICKING AND WHIRRING

1:16:07.450 --> 1:16:08.620
CAMERA CLICKS

1:16:09.790 --> 1:16:12.080
He's still with that model?

1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:13.120
Yeah.

1:16:14.870 --> 1:16:17.450
And she came with him
to visit Luisa.

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:23.160
How is she?

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:27.330
Later, Sergey. Later.

1:16:54.910 --> 1:16:56.450
Come on! Woohoo!

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:08.200
SERGEY PANTS

1:17:12.750 --> 1:17:14.620
Roman?

1:17:30.370 --> 1:17:32.160
I'm afraid of this dream.

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:37.450
Of waking up.

1:17:39.910 --> 1:17:41.000
Of losing you.

1:17:44.290 --> 1:17:45.450
I'm here now.

1:17:52.910 --> 1:17:53.950
What is it?

1:17:56.830 --> 1:17:59.790
You remember my best friend,
Dima?

1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:08.120
On his 13th birthday...

1:18:09.830 --> 1:18:11.660
..my mother made him
an apple pie.

1:18:14.870 --> 1:18:16.120
He lived by the school.

1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:21.830
I wanted him to have it
while it was still warm.

1:18:23.750 --> 1:18:25.000
So I ran all the way.

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:29.040
When I arrived...

1:18:30.330 --> 1:18:33.040
..I heard shouting from inside,

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:34.660
and so I went around
to the window.

1:18:39.250 --> 1:18:41.290
My letters were
scattered all over the floor.

1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:49.080
His father...

1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:50.750
had him pinned to the table...

1:18:53.330 --> 1:18:55.000
..beating him
across the back...

1:18:56.750 --> 1:19:00.410
..yelling, "No son of mine
will be a fucking faggot."

1:19:05.830 --> 1:19:07.330
I'll never forget his look...

1:19:09.950 --> 1:19:11.040
..of disgust.

1:19:18.250 --> 1:19:19.540
And then Dima looked up...

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:22.000
..and saw me.

1:19:25.790 --> 1:19:27.580
And I ran away.

1:19:31.750 --> 1:19:33.620
I ran away.

1:19:42.870 --> 1:19:44.700
He didn't come to school
the next day.

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:52.120
There's a lake
in the forest near the village.

1:19:56.700 --> 1:19:58.620
They found his body there
three days later.

1:20:04.370 --> 1:20:06.250
I've never told this to anyone.

1:20:33.580 --> 1:20:36.120
I have three rules here.

1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:38.000
No vodka,

1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:40.250
no parties with loud music,

1:20:40.290 --> 1:20:41.500
and no girls.

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:45.700
After 11.

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.160
SERGEY: This place
is incredible.

1:21:00.950 --> 1:21:02.000
Welcome home.

1:21:03.330 --> 1:21:06.910
MUSIC PLAYS, LIVELY CHATTER

1:21:16.910 --> 1:21:18.000
As you requested.

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:21.290
The sickle and the hammer.

1:21:21.330 --> 1:21:22.870
First, it cuts off your legs

1:21:22.910 --> 1:21:25.830
and then it smacks you
in the head.

1:21:25.870 --> 1:21:27.500
-A drink?
-Need you ask?

1:21:27.540 --> 1:21:29.290
Look at this place.

1:21:29.330 --> 1:21:32.000
Fighter pilots certainly
make lots of money.

1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:33.580
Na zdarovje.

1:21:33.620 --> 1:21:35.160
GUESTS: Na zdarovje.

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:37.040
? Ra-Ra-Rasputin

1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:39.370
? Lover of the Russian queen

1:21:39.410 --> 1:21:42.660
? There was a cat that
really was gone

1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:44.580
? Ra-Ra-Rasputin

1:21:44.620 --> 1:21:46.830
? Russia's greatest
love machine

1:21:46.870 --> 1:21:50.160
? It was a shame
how he carried on... ?

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:03.620
Sergey is always so serious
about it all.

1:22:03.660 --> 1:22:07.330
He'll play Hamlet or Uncle
Vanya the rest of his life.

1:22:07.370 --> 1:22:09.410
-Yeah, you are right.
-Nothing wrong with that.

1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:12.000
Matvejev. Fuel is running out.

1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:13.660
Coming right up.

1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:16.910
Sergey.

1:22:16.950 --> 1:22:18.200
Sorry.

1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:29.790
Who'd have thought it?

1:22:29.830 --> 1:22:33.660
Actors and pilots
getting along so well.

1:22:33.700 --> 1:22:35.370
I can't imagine it
any other way.

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:39.750
I knew it.

1:22:39.790 --> 1:22:41.080
No.

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:45.250
Volodja.

1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:49.750
-Volodja.
-Get the fuck away from me.

1:22:49.790 --> 1:22:51.370
-Volodja.
-I knew it.

1:22:51.410 --> 1:22:53.660
Zverev should have
investigated my report.

1:22:57.160 --> 1:22:58.330
You?

1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:02.000
You could have got us
sent to prison.

1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:04.120
How was I supposed to know
it was you?

1:23:05.790 --> 1:23:08.080
Why would you do this to her?

1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:10.200
You've ruined her life.

1:23:10.250 --> 1:23:11.660
Volodja...

1:23:12.830 --> 1:23:14.580
-We love each other.
-Stop.

1:23:14.620 --> 1:23:15.950
Stop it.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.700
-We love...
-Stop it. It is not love.

1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:20.750
It's disgusting.

1:23:22.620 --> 1:23:23.910
You make me sick.

1:23:25.870 --> 1:23:26.910
Fuck this.

1:23:28.750 --> 1:23:30.830
You won't tell anyone.

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:34.950
Not Luisa. Not anyone.

1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:37.620
No.

1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:39.000
That is your job.

1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:43.620
You really think he's going to
leave her

1:23:43.660 --> 1:23:45.540
and the air force...

1:23:45.580 --> 1:23:46.660
for you?

1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:56.830
More Soviet volunteers arrived
in Kabul this week

1:23:56.870 --> 1:23:58.870
to liberate the people of
Afghanistan.

Yes, I'm sure.

1:25:53.660 --> 1:25:55.700
Roman, she can't come here.

1:26:00.290 --> 1:26:02.250
I can't tell her to go back.

1:26:02.290 --> 1:26:03.910
Then take her to a hotel.

1:26:03.950 --> 1:26:05.040
She's my wife.

1:26:21.250 --> 1:26:22.830

1:26:22.870 --> 1:26:25.160
You'll move in with me

1:28:11.290 --> 1:28:13.790
but when Roman said that
you were coming,

1:28:13.830 --> 1:28:15.330
I just had to stay and see you.

1:28:16.410 --> 1:28:19.250
You are always welcome in

1:28:19.290 --> 1:28:22.540

When Roma has

Serjozha sits by the window

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:06.580

waiting for him to come home.

1:29:06.620 --> 1:29:07.660
Yeah.

1:29:13.910 --> 1:29:16.000
When Roma finishes here,

1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:17.910
I'll start my medical school.

1:29:17.950 --> 1:29:19.080

1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:21.080

..why don't you go and lie
next to him in his grave?

1:37:02.250 --> 1:37:03.830

you don't even know

You're not his widow.

1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:18.250
You were nothing.

1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:25.120
Then why did he move
to Moscow to be with me?

1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:26.410
Stop it.
