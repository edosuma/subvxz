WEBVTT

00:18.310 --> 00:21.147
(wistful music)

00:33.409 --> 00:34.160
- It's time.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.666
(intense music)

00:57.183 --> 00:59.435
- [Justin] Hello everyone,
I'm Justin McBride,

00:59.518 --> 01:02.021
joined alongside former
champ, J.W. Hart.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.315
J.W., we're in for a
real treat tonight.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.066
The number one bull
rider in the world

01:06.150 --> 01:08.319
versus the number one
bull in the world.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.946
It's Colt Webb
versus Gangbanger.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.740
- This bull is as
rank as they come,

01:12.823 --> 01:14.283
I'm just glad I'm
up here with you.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.743
- Well, a million dollars.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.286
That's what's on the line.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.371
Can Colt Webb be
the first guy to do

01:19.455 --> 01:22.124
what's been impossible,
put his name on that check?

01:22.208 --> 01:23.250
- Well, I've done the math.

01:23.334 --> 01:26.212
That's $125,000 a second.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.506
- Well, unfortunately for Colt,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.257
he only gets that million bucks

01:30.341 --> 01:31.675
if he stays on for
the eight seconds.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.261
- [J.W.] And I got good
and bad news for Colt.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.846
Eight seconds ain't that long,

01:35.930 --> 01:37.640
unless you're on a bull.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.477
(intense music)

01:51.070 --> 01:53.656
(steam blows)

01:53.739 --> 01:56.075
(catchy music)

01:56.158 --> 01:59.954
(drowned out announcer speaks)

02:08.336 --> 02:11.131
- Well, J.W., this will
be the fourth cowboy

02:11.215 --> 02:13.092
to try and attempt to
collect that bounty

02:13.175 --> 02:14.927
off of Gangbanger's head.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.554
Does Colt Webb have a chance?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.223
- Well, Justin, nobody has
even really come close.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.351
But you can't forget that Colt
is the current world champ.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.229
- [Announcer] Gangbanger!

02:28.148 --> 02:29.942
- You ready for this, kid?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.861
- You know it, old man.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.864
- He don't look so bad.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.658
- Well, and these
two have met before.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.411
- They have, at the World
Championships two years ago.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.954
Colt drew Gangbanger.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.664
Made a really good effort,

02:43.747 --> 02:45.207
but the bull got
the best of him.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.918
- [Justin] Well, that's nothing
to hang your head about.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.336
Gangbanger's gotten
the best of everyone.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.296
- [J.W.] Yeah.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.797
And well, the difference
this time around

02:51.881 --> 02:53.632
just might be the
involvement of Tulsa Hughes,

02:53.716 --> 02:55.551
a past world champion
that has some

02:55.634 --> 02:57.219
old school tricks up his sleeve.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.179
- [Justin] Well, that's
why we're all here

02:59.263 --> 03:01.348
to see if the old school tricks

03:01.432 --> 03:03.225
will work for the
young champion.

03:03.309 --> 03:04.894
- Keep going left.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.730
- [Colt] He always goes right.

03:07.813 --> 03:08.564
- Yeah, not tonight.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.317
- You're just trying
to see me bust my butt.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.860
- I think you forgot
about that part

03:12.943 --> 03:15.654
where you promised me 10%
of that million bucks.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.658
I tell you what, it
won't be the first time

03:19.742 --> 03:22.494
you made that wreck's
highlight reel, don't worry.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.079
- Just make sure they
get my name right

03:24.163 --> 03:26.498
when they put it on the check.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.127
- I tell you what.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.378
I'll bet a round of drinks

03:31.462 --> 03:32.504
that you don't last
more than four seconds.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.506
- Oh, you betting
against me now?

03:34.590 --> 03:35.674
- I just want to
make sure I get paid

03:35.758 --> 03:37.009
either way, that's all.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.260
- I'll take that bet.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.261
You just make sure
you don't forget

03:39.345 --> 03:40.888
your wallet this time.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.515
(intense music)

04:00.032 --> 04:02.743
(clocks ticking)

04:02.826 --> 04:06.372
(intense slow motion music)

04:44.952 --> 04:48.455
(dramatic country music)

05:48.807 --> 05:52.019
(wistful piano music)

06:05.699 --> 06:06.700
- That's him.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.202
The short fella in blue.

06:09.787 --> 06:10.996
Looks like he needs ya.

06:16.168 --> 06:16.919
- There you go!

06:17.002 --> 06:17.836
Go get him.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.883
- Hey, get out of here!

06:31.225 --> 06:33.227
You alright, little man?

06:41.568 --> 06:44.655
(catchy country music)

06:54.498 --> 06:55.791
- Hey.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.584
I know you.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.752
You're that bull rider.

06:59.795 --> 07:00.754
Tulsa.

07:00.838 --> 07:01.755
Tulsa Hughes, right?

07:04.758 --> 07:05.717
Weren't you out when that kid

07:05.801 --> 07:07.553
got himself killed last month?

07:10.681 --> 07:11.682
Woo!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.475
I don't know how ya'll do it.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.602
It sounds like a
death wish to me.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.075

Velena Williams?

11:40.158 --> 11:40.909
- Yeah.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.578
Who asking?

11:43.662 --> 11:44.871
- [Officer] Ma'am, we
need to speak to your son.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.415
- Speak to him?

11:46.498 --> 11:48.125
For what?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.668
- Ma'am, we've got
a lot of complaints

11:49.751 --> 11:51.920
about fights and gang
activity in the neighborhood.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.631
- Gang activity?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.258
Sir, my boy 10 years old.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.430
And I'm guessing
ya'll too scared

12:01.513 --> 12:03.140
to go after the real criminals
in this neighborhood.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.808
- Ma'am, can you just
call him out here?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.143
We'll explain it all.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.608
- Indiana.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.443
Come here.

12:20.323 --> 12:23.785
Indiana, these men say
you've been fighting.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.123
Is that true?

12:30.959 --> 12:31.751
Hey!

12:31.835 --> 12:33.462
Indiana, get back here!

12:33.545 --> 12:36.840
(catchy hip hop music)

12:57.360 --> 12:58.111
- Hey, hey, easy, little man.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.613
Hey, what's going on?

12:59.696 --> 13:00.697
Alright, what's going on?
- Let go!

13:00.780 --> 13:01.615
- Hey, who you running from?

13:01.698 --> 13:02.574
- I ain't running from no one!

13:02.657 --> 13:03.742
Now let go of me.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.576
- Ah!

13:05.827 --> 13:06.953
- Hey, thanks man.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.163
- Yeah, thanks man.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.166
- Be careful, aight?

13:11.249 --> 13:11.958
(record scratches)

13:12.042 --> 13:13.418
He's a good kid.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.883
- It's very disturbing
to the court

13:19.966 --> 13:21.635
to think of all
the young people,

13:22.511 --> 13:24.888
especially the young men

13:24.971 --> 13:26.932
who view you as a role model,

13:27.015 --> 13:28.808
and the example you
are setting for them.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.356
There comes a time
in a man's life

13:34.439 --> 13:37.317
when he has to start
acting like a man,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.861
not some drunk
acting like a fool.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.907
I'm assuming you understand
this, Mr. Hughes.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.116
- Your Honor, Mr. Hughes is--

13:45.200 --> 13:47.619
- Ms. Hines, I wasn't
speaking to you.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.497
So, Mr. Hughes.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.082
The question still stands.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.168
- I ain't nobody's role model.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.964
- [Indiana] I ain't
wanting to come up in here.

13:59.047 --> 13:59.881
- Shh, shh.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.174
(gavel slams)

14:01.258 --> 14:03.802
- Bailiff, bring the
young man forward.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.933
Ms. Shaw, I presume
this young man

14:10.016 --> 14:11.434
is under your care?

14:12.769 --> 14:14.312
- Please excuse the
disruption, Your Honor.

14:14.396 --> 14:17.607
This is the first appearance
in court for Mr. Williams.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.609
- And exactly what
brings Mr. Williams

14:19.693 --> 14:20.986
to my courtroom today?

14:21.069 --> 14:22.821
- Assault of an officer
and fighting, Your Honor.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.614
That's why our office
thought a trip here

14:24.698 --> 14:27.284
might be a good preventative
measure for Mr. Williams.

14:28.743 --> 14:29.911
- [Judge] Is Mr.
Williams a candidate

14:29.995 --> 14:31.913
for your mentoring program?

14:31.997 --> 14:32.831
- Yes, Your Honor.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.834
- [Guard] Ow!

14:35.917 --> 14:38.253
(gavel slams)

14:39.379 --> 14:42.882
(melancholic music)

14:42.966 --> 14:44.467
- Now I understand
why everyone complains

14:44.551 --> 14:45.552
about our judicial system,

14:45.635 --> 14:48.054
that judge is, he's an idiot.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.931
- Trust me, it's
not nearly as bad

14:50.015 --> 14:51.099
as you think it is.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.101
- Oh, you think this is funny?

14:53.184 --> 14:55.395
Now look, I fully expected
to lose my license, okay,

14:55.478 --> 14:58.315
do some community service,
but mentor that kid?

15:00.025 --> 15:01.860
Well, this is just some
kind of a sick joke.

15:01.943 --> 15:02.694
Come on, right?

15:05.697 --> 15:08.074
And you did this, didn't you?

15:08.158 --> 15:09.367
- Oh, get over yourself.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.036
- Ah, that's a new line.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.078
- Look.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.456
Like I want to part of
your life again either.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.624
- Oh, no, no.

15:15.707 --> 15:16.708
See, that judge may
have sentenced me

15:16.791 --> 15:17.917
to mentor that kid,

15:18.001 --> 15:19.127
but he did not
sentence me to you.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.504
That sentence ended years ago.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.006
- And thank God it did!

15:23.089 --> 15:25.050
- And we can agree on something.

15:25.133 --> 15:25.967
- Did you ever stop to think--

15:26.051 --> 15:27.469
- I don't have to listen to you.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.807
(somber music)

16:15.225 --> 16:16.017
- Hey, Vee.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.689
- What you want?

16:24.025 --> 16:26.528
- Just want to let
you know I'm back.

16:29.197 --> 16:29.989
- Yeah.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.992
Yeah, I see that.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.622
- Vee, I'm not the
same man I was.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.333
And I wanted to apologize.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.835
- You should keep them apologies

16:41.918 --> 16:43.545
for somebody who cares.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.462
- Well, I think you should know

16:44.546 --> 16:46.214
that I'm gonna make it right.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.048
- Make it right?

16:49.509 --> 16:50.677
Is that what you think?

16:52.053 --> 16:54.013
You think you could
just walk in here

16:54.097 --> 16:54.931
and make it right?

16:57.767 --> 16:58.935
Worst mistake I ever made

16:59.018 --> 17:00.937
was getting involved with you,

17:01.020 --> 17:02.230
and your drug lifestyle.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.483
I was young enough to
make that mistake once.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.154
I ain't that young
no more, so no,

17:09.237 --> 17:10.238
you ain't finsta walk in here

17:10.320 --> 17:12.073
and act like none of
that ever happened.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.407
- You right.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.242
All of that, is right.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.662
But God changed me, Vee.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.039
And if you give me a chance--

17:20.123 --> 17:22.040
- Don't even try that with me.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.126
You think you can walk in here

17:23.209 --> 17:24.419
and talk a bunch of God stuff

17:24.502 --> 17:26.045
and work your way
back into our lives?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.716
No, see, as far
as I'm concerned,

17:29.799 --> 17:31.301
you died years ago.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.552
- You right.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.012
I am dead.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.680
Dead to the old me.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.477
- Well, a leopard can't
change his spots, so.

17:44.147 --> 17:48.735
- If you need me, I'm
staying right down there

17:48.818 --> 17:50.111
across the street.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.490
- Next to your boys
at the drug house?

17:55.533 --> 17:57.285
Looks like your
spots are showing.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.078
Hey, Marcus.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.539
Don't come back.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.385
- Who was that man, Momma?

18:14.469 --> 18:15.345
- Hey.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.305
That was just some stranger.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.182
And we don't talk to strangers.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.434
- Velena, do you have a minute?

18:21.518 --> 18:22.852
I have some news for you.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.605
- I sure hope it's
some good news.

18:25.688 --> 18:26.439
Come on.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.903
(lighthearted music)

18:39.285 --> 18:40.078
- Do you mind?

18:43.623 --> 18:44.415
Seriously.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.295
I'm gonna need you to
fill out these forms,

18:49.379 --> 18:51.047
and here's some personal
information on Indiana

18:51.130 --> 18:52.966
just so you can
understand him better.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.482
- Ah, I think you gave
me the wrong file.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.317
This is for a Dewain Williams.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.114
- It's the right file.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.490
He just goes by Indiana.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.205
I'm also gonna need you
to get fingerprinted.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.665
- You could just get them from
the sheriff's office, okay?

19:25.748 --> 19:26.916
They already took them.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.252
- Look.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.379
This isn't some game, okay?

19:31.462 --> 19:33.172
This is about a kid's life.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.383
You see these files?

19:35.466 --> 19:37.343
These are all kids who need
mentors in their lives,

19:37.427 --> 19:39.387
and the statistics are
frightening for them.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.183
Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

19:44.267 --> 19:46.311
These kids need
positive role models,

19:46.394 --> 19:47.312
they need direction.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.187
Not a single one of them has

19:48.271 --> 19:50.064
an active father in their lives.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.150
- Don't start lecturing me

19:52.233 --> 19:54.193
about being a father, okay?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.322
- What?

19:57.405 --> 19:59.657
This has nothing to do with
you being their father.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.284
It's about investing
in the lives of others.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.243
I mean, are you that bitter

20:02.327 --> 20:03.578
that you don't understand that?

20:03.661 --> 20:05.830
- You have no idea, Ann.

20:05.914 --> 20:06.748
Okay?

20:06.831 --> 20:07.665
You can get off your soapbox,

20:07.749 --> 20:08.833
'cause I didn't pick this.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.337
- You don't pick
anyone, do you, Tulsa?

20:17.300 --> 20:19.177
- Alright, I'll talk
him horseback riding.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.888
- Tulsa, I doubt he's
ever even seen a horse.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.891
Okay, I was thinking more
on the lines of lunch.

20:24.974 --> 20:25.808
- Fine.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.101
Just give me his address.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.145
- It doesn't exactly
work that way either.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.982
Besides, your driver's
license is suspended.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.692
- A technicality.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.197
- I've found that sharing a meal

20:39.280 --> 20:41.032
is a good way to start.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.533
But first you'll need
to meet his mother,

20:42.617 --> 20:44.994
and I've already
told her about you.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.248
- She agreed to this?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.960
- The good news is,
is that Indiana's

20:52.043 --> 20:53.211
out of school for the summer.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.713
So, tomorrow afternoon
I'll pick you up,

20:55.797 --> 20:57.006
we'll head on over to his house

20:57.090 --> 20:58.341
for the formal introductions,

20:58.424 --> 21:00.343
and then we'll go
to a restaurant.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.345
- No one said anything
about meeting his mom.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.972
Okay?

21:04.055 --> 21:06.516
How about you and I, we
meet somewhere, and from--

21:06.599 --> 21:07.642
- Tulsa!

21:07.725 --> 21:09.227
This is serious business.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.229
Flashing in and out
of this kid's life

21:11.312 --> 21:12.939
could do more damage than good.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.483
- Define flash.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.903
- [Ann] It's at least
a one year commitment.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.574
(somber music)

21:28.329 --> 21:30.665
(knocking)

21:50.018 --> 21:50.768
- Tulsa?

21:59.318 --> 22:02.572
(slow lighthearted music)

22:11.497 --> 22:13.499
Tulsa, are you out here?

22:16.044 --> 22:17.128
Tulsa?

22:17.211 --> 22:18.921
(intense music)

22:19.005 --> 22:22.175
I could really use
your help out here.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.594
Anyone?

22:24.677 --> 22:25.428
Help.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.268
(lighthearted music)

22:32.351 --> 22:34.312
- Jim, meet Big Mex.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.314
Big Mex has a little bit of that

22:36.397 --> 22:38.149
Mexican fighting
bull blood in him.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.402
One of the most dangerous
bulls on the planet.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.156
I would hate to be
caught in a pen with him.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.368
Big Mex, meet Jim.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.496
He's my clean shaven agent.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.875
- Tulsa, this isn't funny.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.460
- You know, I rescued
Big Mex from a ranch

22:57.543 --> 22:58.836
where he was being abused.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.381
He's not real fond of people.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.592
See, the bad thing about them

23:04.675 --> 23:06.135
is the tips on those horns,

23:06.219 --> 23:07.512
they are really sharp.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.058
See, the bulls though,
in bull riding events,

23:12.141 --> 23:14.352
they got them tips
sawed off for safety.

23:16.604 --> 23:17.563
Not Big Mex.

23:17.647 --> 23:18.773
He can run those
horns right through

23:18.856 --> 23:20.274
a three piece suit.

23:20.358 --> 23:21.359
- Seriously, Tulsa.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.443
- Hey, whoa, Jim.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.029
I wouldn't move if I were you.

23:26.531 --> 23:27.698
That might make him charge.

23:29.117 --> 23:29.867
The best thing you can do,

23:29.951 --> 23:30.785
you puff out that chest,

23:30.868 --> 23:31.702
and you stand up straight.

23:31.786 --> 23:32.703
You show him you ain't scared.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.831
There you go, yeah.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.542
It might've been that red tie

23:37.625 --> 23:38.584
that caught his eye,

23:38.668 --> 23:40.169
that would be my guess.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.671
I mean, you could always
use that jacket right there

23:41.754 --> 23:44.465
as a matador cape, hm?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.843
- Tulsa.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.719
Please, don't let
this bull kill me.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.516
(whimsical music)

23:53.599 --> 23:55.351
- Or you can make
a break for it,

23:55.434 --> 23:57.687
run for the fence, you
might be able to make it.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.648
(suspenseful music)

24:05.111 --> 24:06.487
Figured you'd take
the running route.

24:06.571 --> 24:10.324
- What kind of fool owns a
bull that attacks people?

24:12.535 --> 24:14.412
- The same kind of fool
that walks into places

24:14.495 --> 24:15.621
he shouldn't be, Jim.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.585
- [Jim] I've been trying to
get ahold of you for days.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.170
- Yeah, I threw my phone away.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.212
- Hey, man.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.505
This is serious.

24:24.589 --> 24:25.923
Will you just stop
and hear me out?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.010
- Okay, what?

24:29.093 --> 24:30.303
- There's been an offer.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.222
- What, you got
another commercial

24:33.306 --> 24:34.974
where you want me to stand
around in my underwear?

24:35.057 --> 24:36.475
- [Jim] They want you
to ride Gangbanger.

24:39.896 --> 24:40.646
- Are you serious, Jim?

24:40.730 --> 24:42.773
- Tulsa, you need this.

24:42.857 --> 24:43.858
- I need this?

24:44.901 --> 24:46.611
Sounds to me like you need this.

24:46.694 --> 24:50.031
- You're never gonna get
another million dollar offer.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.157
- I think you forgot
about the part

24:51.240 --> 24:52.491
where you got to put up $100,000

24:52.575 --> 24:54.035
to get a shot at him, right?

24:54.118 --> 24:56.037
- We'll raise the money
through endorsements.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.622
It's not a problem.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.458
- I got better things to do.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.460
- Tulsa.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.420
Just think about it.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.047
Here's a phone.

25:07.715 --> 25:08.591
Keep up with that.

25:13.930 --> 25:17.308
Is there a different
way I can get out?

25:17.391 --> 25:20.436
(lighthearted music)

25:21.604 --> 25:22.563
Think about it, Tulsa.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.609
I'll be back with you later.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.530
- What are you looking at?

25:35.326 --> 25:38.037
- You know, Indiana,
Tulsa's a bull rider.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.497
You know, like
you see in rodeos.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.539
- Yeah.

25:40.623 --> 25:41.666
My momma told me.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.751
- Well, did she also
tell you that he was a--

25:43.834 --> 25:45.795
- Why do you ride bulls?

25:48.673 --> 25:53.302
- I don't know, I guess
I just grew up doing it.

25:54.679 --> 25:55.471
- Ain't scared?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.141
- Yeah, sometimes.

25:59.225 --> 25:59.976
- Ever got hurt?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.144
- Yeah, a few times.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.690
- My momma said anyone
that rides a bull

26:05.773 --> 26:08.234
must be full of bull.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.360
- Why don't we order?

26:15.032 --> 26:16.450
- You know what?

26:17.660 --> 26:18.577
Your momma's right.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.499
- Ya'll ready?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.792
- I think so.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.628
Indiana, what looks good to you?

26:30.089 --> 26:31.632
- I want a
cheeseburger and fries.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.968
- Make it two of those.

26:35.469 --> 26:36.345
I always said the best bull

26:36.429 --> 26:37.430
is one on a plate.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.557
- What about you, ma'am?

26:39.640 --> 26:40.683
- [Ann] I'll have
the vegetable salad

26:40.766 --> 26:42.101
with vinaigrette dressing.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.691
- Don't you have no
kids of your own?

26:51.736 --> 26:52.528
- Nope.

26:55.239 --> 26:56.032
- Well.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.618
I ain't never had
no daddy no way, so,

26:59.702 --> 27:01.287
I guess we got
something in common.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.957
(somber music)

27:28.522 --> 27:29.815
- I've been trying to
reach you for days.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.567
- Here, hold this
for me, will you?

27:31.650 --> 27:32.651
I'll take that.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.154
- Where's the phone I gave you?

27:36.113 --> 27:36.989
- I threw it away.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.415
- I've raised the 100K.

27:48.167 --> 27:48.918
- Good for you.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.795
- I've got the contract.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.757
All you need to do is sign this.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.637
They say you're too
scared to do it.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.223
You're too old.

28:03.808 --> 28:04.892
You're too banged up.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.030
- They just want to
see someone else die.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.201
This ain't bull riding,
it's a circus event.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.370
- Call it what you want, Tulsa.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.830
It's a million bucks.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.291
- So, is that what
this is about, Jim?

28:29.375 --> 28:31.752
Hm, the money?

28:31.836 --> 28:33.212
Your 10%?

28:34.713 --> 28:35.506
- Tulsa.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.259
Look.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.679
You know that's not what I mean.

28:46.100 --> 28:46.892
- You know what?

28:49.395 --> 28:52.606
Alright.

28:52.690 --> 28:53.899
I'll ride him into the ground,

28:53.983 --> 28:56.026
but we're gonna
do it on my terms.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.863
You understand?

28:58.946 --> 28:59.989
(catchy music)

29:00.072 --> 29:01.282
- Fine.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.617
I'm sure I can get
them to do whatever.

29:03.701 --> 29:06.787
Just tell me what
changes I need to make.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.706
And I'll call you.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.125
(door slams)

29:11.208 --> 29:14.670
(chuckles) I mean,
I'll stop back by.

29:18.924 --> 29:19.717
Yes!

29:22.136 --> 29:24.763
- [Reporter] Tulsa, why
did you decide to do this?

29:26.932 --> 29:29.810
- I'm a bull rider,
it's what I do.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.731
- Since you haven't
ridden professionally

29:33.814 --> 29:35.232
in over five years,

29:35.316 --> 29:36.901
what makes you think
you can ride a bull

29:36.984 --> 29:38.777
that nobody else can?

29:38.861 --> 29:40.237
- Probably the same thing
that makes you think

29:40.321 --> 29:42.531
you can write a decent story.

29:42.615 --> 29:43.824
- Let's not forget that Tulsa

29:43.908 --> 29:45.993
is a former world champion.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.747
There's no question
that riding Gangbanger

29:49.830 --> 29:51.707
is a challenge for anyone.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.669
But maybe a wily, old
veteran is just the ticket.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.088
- Mr. Ferguson.

29:58.172 --> 29:59.840
As the owner of Gangbanger,

29:59.924 --> 30:02.635
you have been selecting
young, current riders

30:02.718 --> 30:03.552
to ride your bull.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.555
So, why this change in strategy?

30:06.639 --> 30:07.932
- Well, if you had
done your homework,

30:08.015 --> 30:10.601
you'd know that the
last time I had a bull

30:10.684 --> 30:12.520
with a streak of over 40 outs,

30:13.771 --> 30:15.105
Tulsa, he was the
one that broke it.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.774
So, you might say I'm just out

30:16.857 --> 30:18.275
after a little revenge.

30:18.359 --> 30:19.944
- So, you're saying you
don't actually believe

30:20.027 --> 30:21.612
Tulsa can ride Gangbanger?

30:21.695 --> 30:23.822
- I don't think anybody
can ride my bull,

30:23.906 --> 30:26.325
but Tulsa is a worthy opponent.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.869
If he'll put up the money,
I'll cash his check.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.913
- Tulsa, you've had a
lot of serious injuries

30:30.996 --> 30:32.164
over the years,

30:32.248 --> 30:33.958
what's your body telling you?

30:34.041 --> 30:35.167
- Well, just not
to get stomped on

30:35.251 --> 30:37.294
like I did in Oklahoma City.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.631
- Are you scared Gangbanger
might kill you too?

30:43.092 --> 30:45.344
- You know, my daddy used
to say something to me,

30:45.427 --> 30:48.305
he used to tell me that you

30:48.389 --> 30:50.099
don't stand in front of a bull,

30:51.976 --> 30:56.522
behind a horse, or
anywhere near a fool.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.113
(catchy music)

31:08.409 --> 31:10.286
- That's all for
today, thank you.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.838
- Go, go, go, go,

31:22.756 --> 31:24.216
go, go, go, go, go!

31:26.010 --> 31:28.679
(loud commotion)

31:35.603 --> 31:36.979
- Take five, boys.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.485
Not bad, not bad.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.280
So, how'd it feel?

31:46.363 --> 31:47.906
- [Marcus] It ain't my best.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.826
(Buck chuckles)

31:50.909 --> 31:54.038
- Now, there's a
sight for sore eyes.

31:55.539 --> 31:56.957
- How you doing, Buck?

31:57.041 --> 31:58.292
- Tulsa.

31:58.375 --> 32:03.005
Let me introduce you to
an old family friend.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.133
Marcus Cruz, say hello
the best bull rider

32:06.216 --> 32:08.218
I ever worked
with, Tulsa Hughes.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.138
- It's nice to meet ya.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.725
- So, where'd you learn
to ride like that, huh?

32:15.976 --> 32:18.020
- Well, I picked up a
few things from some guy.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.939
- Mm, yeah, I think
I know that same guy

32:21.023 --> 32:24.568
who's got a bad back,
he complains a lot,

32:24.652 --> 32:26.111
can't hear nothing no more, huh?

32:26.195 --> 32:27.821
- That would be
the guy. (laughs)

32:27.905 --> 32:29.323
- Comedians, huh?

32:29.406 --> 32:30.824
Let everyone know Tulsa's here,

32:30.908 --> 32:32.076
time to get to work.

32:32.159 --> 32:33.160
- Alright.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.120
Well, it was nice meeting you.

32:37.373 --> 32:39.958
(Buck chuckles)

32:41.168 --> 32:42.586
- Yeah, the name rings a bell.

32:42.670 --> 32:43.962
- It should.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.506
About 10 years ago he was

32:45.589 --> 32:48.175
one of the top high
school bull riders.

32:48.258 --> 32:49.593
- That's right.

32:49.677 --> 32:50.928
What happened?

32:51.011 --> 32:53.138
- Short story, he got
in with the wrong group,

32:54.390 --> 32:55.974
one of the biggest waste
of talent I ever seen.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.018
Kid could ride.

32:58.102 --> 32:59.311
Probably the best thing for him

32:59.395 --> 33:00.771
was being able to keep riding

33:00.854 --> 33:02.106
while he was in jail.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.401
In fact, I think he won that
prison rodeo every year.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.403
I don't know if you noticed,

33:07.486 --> 33:08.570
but he's still got it.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.824
But enough about him.

33:11.907 --> 33:12.908
It's your time.

33:12.991 --> 33:13.951
How you feelin'?

33:16.704 --> 33:17.871
- Yeah, I'm good.

33:17.955 --> 33:18.956
My shoulder's giving
me a little bit

33:19.039 --> 33:20.374
of a problem though, but--

33:20.457 --> 33:22.543
- When's the last time
you were on a bull?

33:26.046 --> 33:27.798
- Well now, that's been a while.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.550
- (chuckles) Oh, well.

33:29.633 --> 33:30.759
Hey boys.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.302
Let's get Tigerbait
in the chute.

33:39.643 --> 33:40.394
Mhm, ease down on him.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.062
- Easy, boy, easy.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.441
- [Buck] Now, feet in.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.162
- [Rider] Pull it.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.873
- [Tulsa] I can move forward.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.333
You can go tighter
than that, come on.

34:03.417 --> 34:04.376
Hold on now.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.462
Alright.

34:11.925 --> 34:13.302
I'm ready.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.721
- [Buck] Nice, time to ride.

34:15.804 --> 34:16.889
Let her down.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.268
Keep your head down, right?

34:24.772 --> 34:26.565
Nod when you're ready.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.744
- I'm sorry,
something ain't right.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.079
- [Buck] What's the matter?

34:46.376 --> 34:48.504
What's the matter, Tulsa?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.051
- Where's the trough at, hm?

34:54.134 --> 34:55.302
I gotta pee.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.346
- It's right over there.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.810
(slow dramatic music)

35:47.437 --> 35:50.190
(Tulsa sniffs)

36:12.296 --> 36:15.007
(catchy music)

36:31.815 --> 36:33.275
- [Buck] Ease down.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.154
(catchy music)

36:44.661 --> 36:46.163
Nice, nice riding.

36:46.246 --> 36:47.664
- Outside.

36:47.748 --> 36:51.460
(intense rock music)

36:51.543 --> 36:54.254
(crowd cheers)

37:03.764 --> 37:04.598
- [Ann] Not bad.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.602
- (chuckles) Maybe
not for the bull.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.271
Now, what you think cowboy, huh?

37:11.355 --> 37:12.314
- How'd you do that?

37:13.941 --> 37:15.233
- Well, I tell you what.

37:15.317 --> 37:18.612
We go get a
cheeseburger and fries?

37:18.695 --> 37:19.529
Do that tonight?

37:19.613 --> 37:20.572
Tell you all about it, huh?

37:20.656 --> 37:21.573
- Can we?

37:21.657 --> 37:23.241
- Supper, tonight?

37:23.325 --> 37:24.534
Looks like someone's warming up

37:24.618 --> 37:25.744
to being a mentor.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.373
- Just fulfilling my
sentence, that's all.

37:29.456 --> 37:30.749
- Okay, but only if
you spend some time

37:30.832 --> 37:32.042
doing your homework too.

37:33.210 --> 37:34.544
- But school is
out for the summer.

37:34.628 --> 37:36.254
- Yes, but because
of your poor grades,

37:36.338 --> 37:38.298
you have to study
during the summer too.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.343
- School is boring.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.386
- Kid's got a point.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.263
- Uh, that's not the kind
of positive reinforcement

37:45.347 --> 37:46.682
we're looking for, cowboy.

37:47.557 --> 37:48.350
- Very sorry.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.229
- What's positive reinforcement?

37:52.312 --> 37:54.815
- Something you will learn
if you stay in school.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.360
- I wish I could
continue on with this,

37:58.443 --> 38:01.488
I gotta rematch put
together though.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.032
So, if you don't mind,
get that hat back,

38:04.116 --> 38:05.450
thank you very much.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.577
Alright.

38:10.539 --> 38:13.417
Now, I want that
same bull, Buck.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.751
Round two.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.170
- Alright boys, let's
run him back, chop, chop.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.430
So, how's that shoulder
feeling on you?

38:26.513 --> 38:28.557
- [Tulsa] Yeah, it's stiff.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.351
Yeah, I tell you though,

38:31.435 --> 38:32.519
it's not quite as
bad as I thought

38:32.602 --> 38:34.396
it was gonna be.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.441
(melancholic music)

39:04.801 --> 39:07.179
- Ya'll weren't playing
about that horseback riding.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.221
- Yeah.

39:08.305 --> 39:09.389
Indiana's really
looking forward to it.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.016
- Oh, remember, my
baby ain't never been

39:11.099 --> 39:12.392
on no horse before.

39:12.476 --> 39:14.061
- Don't worry, I'm going along

39:14.144 --> 39:15.771
on the ride too, it's safe.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.398
Trust me, he'll have
a really good time.

39:18.482 --> 39:19.483
- Howdy, ma'am.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.486
It's good to see you again.

39:22.569 --> 39:23.570
- Howdy.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.365
Hold on.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.453
Indiana, they're here for you.

39:34.998 --> 39:37.125
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.169
How you doin', huh?

39:39.252 --> 39:41.296
- Well, we better get going.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.839
We'll have him back before dark.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.633
- Okay.

39:45.592 --> 39:46.802
Well, ya'll be careful.

39:48.637 --> 39:49.429
- Ma'am.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.432
- Bye.

39:52.516 --> 39:55.560
(lighthearted music)

39:59.773 --> 40:00.732
- Horseback riding.

40:02.859 --> 40:03.652
Hm.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.991
(Vee happily sighs)

40:17.374 --> 40:18.416
- Does he bite?

40:19.626 --> 40:21.419
- Well, he's a she.

40:21.503 --> 40:22.879
- Does she bite?

40:25.048 --> 40:26.383
- Only bad kids.

40:30.554 --> 40:31.429
I need you to do
me a favor, okay?

40:31.513 --> 40:33.849
I can't have you biting Indiana.

40:33.932 --> 40:34.641
Alright?

40:34.724 --> 40:35.475
He's my friend, okay?

40:38.520 --> 40:39.479
Oh, okay.

40:40.730 --> 40:41.481
Alright.

40:41.565 --> 40:42.941
- What'd she say?

40:43.024 --> 40:44.776
- Well, she said she likes you.

40:45.861 --> 40:47.863
She's a little worried though.

40:47.946 --> 40:48.655
- About what?

40:50.240 --> 40:52.576
- Well, she says those
are basketball shoes

40:52.659 --> 40:53.660
that you got on, right?

40:53.743 --> 40:55.120
So if get your foot stepped on,

40:55.203 --> 40:55.912
it's gonna hurt.

40:57.581 --> 41:00.417
We already thought
about that though, so,

41:00.500 --> 41:01.960
I'm looking forward to it.

41:02.043 --> 41:02.752
Come here.

41:03.879 --> 41:04.671
Alrighty.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.091
Come on, up we go.

41:11.428 --> 41:12.554
I got you these, okay?

41:14.347 --> 41:16.183
Now put these on, alright?

41:16.266 --> 41:17.100
- Okay.

41:17.184 --> 41:17.934
- So...

41:21.104 --> 41:22.731
Your jeans go on
the outside, okay.

41:22.814 --> 41:23.523
- [Indiana] Outside.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.317
- Outside is right.

41:27.569 --> 41:28.612
Alright.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.199
That's better.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.535
- I'm impressed.

41:37.704 --> 41:38.580
- I'm gonna see
what you look like

41:38.663 --> 41:40.040
up in that saddle now, okay?

41:40.123 --> 41:40.832
- [Indiana] Okay.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.375
- You ready?

41:42.459 --> 41:45.128
Take that left
hand on that horn.

41:45.212 --> 41:46.671
I'll pick you up, you
take that left foot,

41:46.755 --> 41:48.006
you put it right in here, okay?

41:48.089 --> 41:49.841
One, two, up!

41:51.259 --> 41:52.010
Get it?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.345
Swing that leg.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.681
There you go.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.724
Told you she was gentle, right?

41:57.807 --> 41:59.559
- It's okay, Indiana.

41:59.643 --> 42:00.560
You're gonna do great.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.606
- I don't know, something
still just don't seem right.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.530
You know, that's right.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.991
I appreciate you, thank
you for pointing that out.

42:16.493 --> 42:20.538
You know, Sally noticed
something else was missing.

42:25.252 --> 42:26.044
- Cool.

42:27.379 --> 42:29.130
- I need you to remember
something, okay?

42:29.214 --> 42:32.592
Every cowboy has to
have a cowboy hat.

42:32.676 --> 42:33.677
Alright?

42:34.594 --> 42:35.929
- Okay.

42:36.012 --> 42:36.721
- You ready to ride?

42:36.805 --> 42:38.348
- Yes, sir.

42:38.431 --> 42:39.849
- Yeehaw.

42:39.933 --> 42:42.978
(lighthearted music)

43:17.012 --> 43:20.056
So, how long have you
been doing this for?

43:20.140 --> 43:21.850
Working with kids?

43:21.933 --> 43:23.518
- About three years now.

43:23.601 --> 43:24.728
Not long after we broke up.

43:26.646 --> 43:28.690
- Well, it seems
like you enjoy it.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.693
- You know, I just
wanna make a difference.

43:31.776 --> 43:32.986
Change lives for the better.

43:34.195 --> 43:35.322
- Well, you got your
work cut out for you,

43:35.405 --> 43:36.156
that's for sure.

43:37.699 --> 43:40.035
- Actually, I've made a
lot of changes in my life.

43:41.870 --> 43:42.620
- Like?

43:44.289 --> 43:46.416
- Ah, you wouldn't understand.

43:48.626 --> 43:49.502
- Oh, come on, try me.

43:49.586 --> 43:50.420
What you got?

43:56.301 --> 43:57.761
- It's about fear, you know?

43:59.095 --> 44:00.180
- [Tulsa] Fear.

44:00.263 --> 44:01.723
- Yeah.

44:01.806 --> 44:02.932
Many of the issues
in our communities,

44:03.016 --> 44:05.101
we see something we
fear, we run from it.

44:05.185 --> 44:07.062
Classic fight or flight.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.229
I'm choosing to fight.

44:10.482 --> 44:11.775
- You lost me in there,

44:11.858 --> 44:13.193
I thought we were
talking about you.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.822
- These issues, these kids.

44:17.906 --> 44:19.908
We can take a stand and
fight the issues of poverty,

44:19.991 --> 44:22.077
lack of education, and crime,

44:22.160 --> 44:23.411
or we can just flee from it,

44:23.495 --> 44:25.830
move to another
neighborhood or town.

44:25.914 --> 44:27.123
But guess what?

44:27.207 --> 44:28.333
It's just gonna
follow you there.

44:29.793 --> 44:31.795
- I ain't running from nobody.

44:31.878 --> 44:34.172
- Maybe not, but are
you taking a stand?

44:35.715 --> 44:38.343
Look, kids like Indiana
have little chance

44:38.426 --> 44:40.678
if people don't intercede
into their lives.

44:40.762 --> 44:42.889
By the time kids like
him are five years old,

44:42.972 --> 44:44.432
they've already
seen and experienced

44:44.516 --> 44:46.726
what most kids two or three
times their age would.

44:48.728 --> 44:49.562
- Shoot, I don't know.

44:49.646 --> 44:50.605
Life don't seem too bad,

44:50.688 --> 44:51.773
he's playing on a tire swing,

44:51.856 --> 44:52.899
he's smiling, he's
having a good time.

44:52.982 --> 44:55.110
His mom seems like a nice lady.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.403
I mean, come on, what you want?

44:56.486 --> 44:57.779
- She is nice.

44:57.862 --> 44:59.739
But as he gets older, the
streets will raise him,

44:59.823 --> 45:01.408
if people like you
don't intercede.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.245
The fact is, 80% of
incarcerated males

45:05.328 --> 45:07.247
grew up in fatherless homes,

45:07.330 --> 45:10.875
and 60% of prison inmates
are functionally illiterate.

45:10.959 --> 45:13.128
Kids like Indiana know
more people in jail

45:13.211 --> 45:14.212
than they do in college.

45:14.295 --> 45:15.463
- Okay, I get it, I get it,

45:15.547 --> 45:17.966
but doesn't it come
down to a person

45:18.049 --> 45:19.968
making a choice, though?

45:20.051 --> 45:22.762
- I hear that a lot, or
how it's a racial problem.

45:23.638 --> 45:24.889
But the truth is,

45:24.973 --> 45:26.391
these kids just need
positive role models.

45:26.474 --> 45:27.725
For the most part,
they just want to feel

45:27.809 --> 45:29.394
like they belong.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.146
So they become involved
with the first thing

45:31.229 --> 45:32.689
that comes along.

45:32.772 --> 45:34.774
Unfortunately,
it's often a gang,

45:34.858 --> 45:36.025
or kids raised in poverty.

45:37.193 --> 45:39.028
Take your life, for example.

45:39.112 --> 45:40.572
You became involved
in bull riding

45:40.655 --> 45:43.158
because you were exposed
to it from a young age.

45:43.241 --> 45:44.451
- Well, yeah.

45:44.534 --> 45:46.244
Well, like I said,
it was a choice.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.872
- Yeah, but how many
choices did they have?

45:49.873 --> 45:51.207
We need to offer them more,

45:51.291 --> 45:53.251
and give them better options.

45:53.334 --> 45:54.752
Many of them want to
make the right choices,

45:54.836 --> 45:56.963
they're just not
given an opportunity.

45:57.046 --> 45:59.299
And our system isn't
helping mch either.

45:59.382 --> 46:02.594
- Oh, okay, so now we're
blaming the system, huh?

46:02.677 --> 46:04.637
- I didn't say it was
the cause of the problem,

46:04.721 --> 46:06.639
but it sure could
use some improvement.

46:07.849 --> 46:09.767
The broken family is the
number one contributor

46:09.851 --> 46:11.895
to children living in poverty.

46:11.978 --> 46:14.772
And our current system actually
penalizes married couples.

46:14.856 --> 46:15.815
- Yeah, right.

46:15.899 --> 46:17.358
- It's true.

46:17.442 --> 46:19.235
- Single moms get
more financial support

46:19.319 --> 46:20.528
than married couples.

46:22.947 --> 46:24.991
- Oh, I have to
call BS on that one.

46:25.074 --> 46:26.951
- Well, then you check
into it yourself.

46:27.035 --> 46:28.077
- Well, maybe I will.

46:29.245 --> 46:30.830
- Kids like Indiana
are just victims

46:30.914 --> 46:32.582
of our broken system.

46:32.665 --> 46:34.459
Somehow, we've got to change it.

46:36.753 --> 46:38.463
- Let's not talk
politics right now.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.757
I mean, a politician made a guy

46:40.840 --> 46:42.759
charged with a DUI a mentor, so.

46:44.093 --> 46:47.639
- Okay, I'll agree it's
not the ideal solution,

46:47.722 --> 46:50.350
but I do understand the
judge's perspective.

46:50.433 --> 46:51.392
- Oh, alright, well.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.354
Maybe you can explain it to me,

46:54.437 --> 46:55.939
what you got?

46:56.022 --> 46:59.943
- Like I said, these kids just
need positive role models.

47:00.026 --> 47:03.821
And while you're
obviously not perfect--

47:03.905 --> 47:06.282
- Well, I guess I walked
right into that one, didn't I?

47:06.366 --> 47:09.244
- You sure did. (chuckles)

47:09.327 --> 47:10.995
If you stick with this,

47:11.079 --> 47:13.790
you're gonna find that
it's really rewarding.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.212
(calming piano music)

47:21.214 --> 47:22.465
- Look, I'm willing to
play the role, okay?

47:22.549 --> 47:24.592
I'll fulfill my
sins and all but,

47:27.720 --> 47:29.681
I'm not a role model, okay?

47:31.057 --> 47:33.309
- Our choice is not
if we're a role model,

47:33.393 --> 47:34.435
but rather what kind.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.732
- Can we go ride some more?

47:42.902 --> 47:45.989
- I mean, shoot, he
didn't do half bad, so.

47:46.072 --> 47:47.490
- [Ann] You did do pretty good?

47:47.574 --> 47:48.658
- What do you say,
you want to pick up

47:48.741 --> 47:49.701
the pace a little bit?

47:49.784 --> 47:50.493
Huh?

47:50.577 --> 47:51.411
What you think?

47:51.494 --> 47:53.162
- Please, can we, Ms. Ann?

47:53.246 --> 47:55.081
- Yeah, I mean come on, Ms. Ann.

47:55.164 --> 47:56.416
Please, can we?

47:56.499 --> 47:58.543
- What am I gonna do
with the two of you?

48:00.336 --> 48:01.296
Alright, let's go.

48:01.379 --> 48:04.841
- Alright then, let's go, huh?

48:28.031 --> 48:28.948
Hey there.

48:29.032 --> 48:31.117
- Boots and a hat.
- A hat and everything.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.619
- You did so good, didn't you?

48:32.702 --> 48:33.870
Tell her how good you did!

48:33.953 --> 48:35.246
- I don't want to brag, but--

48:35.330 --> 48:36.914
- [Tulsa] Brag it
up, brag it up.

48:36.998 --> 48:37.999
- Alright.

48:41.294 --> 48:43.004
- Alright, take care.

48:46.257 --> 48:47.759
Did you have fun?

48:50.053 --> 48:52.555
(somber music)

49:04.942 --> 49:06.486
Aw, no, I put him to bed.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.112
He was tuckered out.

49:09.614 --> 49:13.117
No, I ain't seen him this
happy in a long time.

49:17.580 --> 49:20.958
Hey, let me call you back.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.212
No, no, it's cool.

49:24.295 --> 49:27.006
I just gotta take care
of something real quick.

49:27.090 --> 49:28.549
Alight.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.051
Bye.

49:30.134 --> 49:31.636
What do you want?

49:32.970 --> 49:34.097
- I just want to talk.

49:34.972 --> 49:37.058
- We ain't got
nothing to talk about.

49:39.352 --> 49:41.604
- I want to spend
some time with him.

49:41.688 --> 49:43.231
- I thought I made myself clear

49:43.314 --> 49:44.482
last time you was here.

49:45.858 --> 49:46.609
Just...

49:47.777 --> 49:49.153
- I've got a right to see him!

49:53.658 --> 49:55.785
- That's the Marcus I remember.

49:55.868 --> 49:58.955
Screaming and
demanding your way.

49:59.038 --> 49:59.997
What?

50:00.081 --> 50:01.499
What are you gonna
do next, Marcus?

50:01.582 --> 50:02.333
You gonna hit me?

50:07.672 --> 50:09.924
- I just want to see my son.

50:10.007 --> 50:10.842
- Your son.

50:16.013 --> 50:20.059
Besides, he already
got somebody.

50:23.020 --> 50:23.813
- Yeah.

50:26.858 --> 50:28.735
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

50:30.194 --> 50:33.156
You see, I don't think Tulsa's
a good influence on him.

50:33.239 --> 50:34.198
- Whoa, what?

50:34.282 --> 50:35.241
Are you is?

50:36.534 --> 50:38.119
(laughs)

50:38.202 --> 50:39.495
- I'm not the same.

50:42.081 --> 50:44.500
- Your daddy was a
felon, you a felon.

50:45.752 --> 50:47.962
My boy ain't gonna
be no felon, Marcus.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.089
- That's exactly the
cycle I wanna break, Vee!

50:52.216 --> 50:53.301
I want to prove myself,

50:53.384 --> 50:55.094
but you've got to
give me a chance.

51:02.101 --> 51:03.227
Can I talk to him?

51:04.228 --> 51:05.021
- He's sleeping.

51:10.401 --> 51:11.194
- Alright.

51:14.822 --> 51:17.325
Well, can I just...

51:22.079 --> 51:24.290
Can I just peek in on him?

51:26.125 --> 51:27.919
Just for a little bit?

51:30.296 --> 51:31.422
Please?

51:31.506 --> 51:34.175
(somber music)

52:25.893 --> 52:27.770
(chuckles)

52:27.854 --> 52:29.230
- Morning, Tulsa.

52:29.313 --> 52:30.147
- Good morning.

52:30.231 --> 52:31.190
- You two are who I wake up to.

52:32.316 --> 52:35.236
- Guess who arrived
in time today?

52:36.487 --> 52:39.782
Yep, media was out here earlier.

52:39.866 --> 52:42.410
Crazy reporters think
they can interview a bull.

52:42.493 --> 52:43.578
(laughs)

52:43.661 --> 52:45.204
You want to see him?

52:45.288 --> 52:46.789
- I've seen him before.

52:46.873 --> 52:49.709
- Well, if you change
your mind, he'll be here.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.294
Heck, he eats better than me.

52:52.378 --> 52:53.671
- Good.

52:53.754 --> 52:54.797
Fatten him up for
the kill then, huh?

52:54.881 --> 52:55.631
(Buck laughs)

52:55.715 --> 52:57.174
- Hey.

52:57.258 --> 52:59.343
We got a rank one for you today.

52:59.427 --> 53:01.095
Brought in special.

53:01.178 --> 53:04.265
They say his style is
similar to Gangbanger's.

53:04.348 --> 53:05.433
Think you're ready for it?

53:06.517 --> 53:08.394
- Buck, I was born ready.

53:08.477 --> 53:11.355
- I like the sound of
that, let's get 'er done.

53:11.439 --> 53:12.189
Hey, boys?

53:23.576 --> 53:25.995
- You don't need that stuff.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.332
- What you talking about?

53:30.207 --> 53:31.208
- The painkillers.

53:32.752 --> 53:34.211
I saw them.

53:34.295 --> 53:35.129
- So what?

53:35.212 --> 53:36.422
They're prescription.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.174
- Yeah, I've seen my
share of guys abusing it.

53:38.257 --> 53:41.344
If I was to guess,
I'd say you was

53:41.427 --> 53:42.803
putting them up your nose.

53:42.887 --> 53:44.805
At least that's
what I'd have done.

53:44.889 --> 53:48.267
- That sounds like that'd be
your problem then, not mine.

53:48.351 --> 53:50.269
- Look man, I did
10 years behind bars

53:50.353 --> 53:52.229
because of what stuff
like that made me do.

53:53.856 --> 53:55.358
I know an addict when I see one.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.529
- Yeah, well, I know a
felon when I see one.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.861
- Look here, little ass kid.

54:40.945 --> 54:43.072
You better carry your punk
ass home to your momma.

54:46.659 --> 54:49.245
(Indiana coughs)

(catchy hiphop music)

55:03.217 --> 55:05.511
(knocking)

55:13.352 --> 55:14.478
- Hey, Velena.

55:14.562 --> 55:15.396
We're here to get Indiana.

55:15.479 --> 55:16.313
Just going out for some supper,

55:16.397 --> 55:17.898
we shouldn't be long.

55:17.982 --> 55:22.153
- Uh, he had a run in with
the neighborhood boys.

55:22.236 --> 55:23.446
- Is he okay?

55:23.529 --> 55:24.739
- Yeah.

55:24.822 --> 55:27.199
I just, I don't think he'd be up

55:27.283 --> 55:28.492
for going out right now.

55:31.287 --> 55:34.331
- You mind if I talk to him?

55:34.415 --> 55:35.958
- Um, sure, yeah.

55:36.042 --> 55:36.917
He in his room.

55:49.764 --> 55:50.556
- Hey, man.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.062
What's wrong, cowboy?

55:57.855 --> 55:58.689
- He took my hat.

56:00.274 --> 56:01.025
- Who did?

56:03.027 --> 56:05.404
- Those guys over
at the drug house.

56:07.907 --> 56:09.408
- You okay?

56:09.492 --> 56:10.242
- Yeah.

56:19.251 --> 56:20.961
- I'll be right back.

56:24.673 --> 56:25.841
- Tulsa, no.

56:25.925 --> 56:27.802
Tulsa, don't do this.

56:27.885 --> 56:28.594
Tulsa!

56:28.677 --> 56:29.720
Listen to me.

56:29.804 --> 56:31.013
You don't need to do this, okay?

56:31.097 --> 56:32.807
Try to set a good
example for him.

56:32.890 --> 56:34.100
- This is who I am.

56:35.226 --> 56:36.018
Deal with it!

56:37.520 --> 56:40.481
- Oh, I can't believe him.

56:40.564 --> 56:42.900
(tense music)

56:52.493 --> 56:53.285
- What's up?

56:54.495 --> 56:55.746
- You just got something

56:55.830 --> 56:57.581
that don't belong
to you, that's all.

56:57.665 --> 56:59.083
- Man, what you talking about?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.294
- Just coming for the hat, okay?

57:02.378 --> 57:04.713
(tense music)

57:08.092 --> 57:10.553
I wonder how long
it's been since

57:10.636 --> 57:12.805
you had an ass whooping, hm?

57:12.888 --> 57:14.557
(laughing)

57:14.640 --> 57:16.392
- Damon, he said that.

57:19.353 --> 57:22.773
I'm just curious
how long it been

57:22.857 --> 57:24.942
since you had a
cap in your head?

57:27.903 --> 57:30.906
(suspenseful music)

57:36.453 --> 57:38.205
- Hey, hey, easy, big homie.

57:39.165 --> 57:40.457
It's cool.

57:40.541 --> 57:41.625
- [Gang Member] You
know this white boy?

57:41.709 --> 57:42.835
- Yeah, he a friend.

57:44.336 --> 57:45.546
- [Gang Member] I suggest
you get his white ass

57:45.629 --> 57:46.463
before I kill him.

57:47.381 --> 57:48.132
- Appreciate it.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.260
Come on.

57:56.557 --> 57:57.600
Come on.

57:58.601 --> 58:02.479
- I see you got a full
house over here, huh?

58:02.563 --> 58:03.522
You ever play poker?

58:09.612 --> 58:10.863
- Man, what just happened?

58:10.946 --> 58:12.156
- Man, don't even
worry about it, man.

58:12.239 --> 58:13.866
Pick the dominoes up.

58:17.328 --> 58:18.454
- Give me 15.

58:18.537 --> 58:19.663
- Man, you ain't getting 15.

58:19.747 --> 58:21.040
You give me 15.

58:21.832 --> 58:24.460
(tense music)

58:38.474 --> 58:41.310
♪ I've been drinking ♪

58:41.393 --> 58:43.646
♪ All night ♪

58:43.729 --> 58:46.649
♪ I've been feeling ♪

58:46.732 --> 58:48.901
♪ Alright ♪

58:52.780 --> 58:54.323
You ready to party, Big Mex?

59:03.165 --> 59:03.999
Let's party.

59:05.334 --> 59:07.628
(Tulsa hums)

59:08.879 --> 59:11.882
(catchy drum music)

59:30.859 --> 59:32.861
- What are you doing?

59:32.945 --> 59:36.532
- Well, I am setting
up the table.

59:38.742 --> 59:39.535
- What?

59:40.494 --> 59:41.287
- Bull poker.

59:43.747 --> 59:46.041
Finna teach them how to play.

59:48.002 --> 59:48.794
- No.

59:50.045 --> 59:51.672
That ain't a good idea.

59:51.755 --> 59:53.590
These ain't the kind of
guys you mess around with.

59:53.674 --> 59:55.342
- [Tulsa] Yeah,
well, neither am I.

59:56.593 --> 59:57.636
And besides, they got
something that belongs

59:57.720 --> 59:58.679
to a friend of mine.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.473
- Look, man.

01:00:01.557 --> 01:00:06.520
Just give him another hat.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:10.858
- It wouldn't be the same.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.026
- It's a hat.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:16.655
- It's about more
than just the hat.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:20.284
You see, it's about standing up

01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:23.370
for those you care about.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:29.543
Now, you gotta get outta my way.

01:00:34.757 --> 01:00:36.342
- You can't do this.

01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:42.931
Alone.

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:49.730
- Now we're talking. (chuckles)

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:50.731
- So, what's your plan?

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:56.111
- Well, I'm gonna
take this door,

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.282
I'm gonna back it right on up

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:03.327
to that door,

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:08.624
then we're gonna get
the hell out of the way.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:11.794
Giddy up?

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:13.712
- Yup.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:33.941
(loud rumbling)

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:38.362
- Yo dudes, you hear that?

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:39.738
- I'm trippin' man, I don't
even hear nothing man.

01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.156
- Hey, hey, no, go out there

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.825
and see what it is, homie.

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:43.867
- Man, you trippin' man.

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:48.038
There ain't nothing
out there, man.

01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:49.873
- Yo, yo, man, ya'll wake up.

01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:51.333
Wake up, ay, wake up, wake up.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:52.251
Pretty Boy, get up.

01:01:53.544 --> 01:01:55.003
There's someone at
the door, homie.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:56.755
I hear someone.

01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:58.757
(Bull bellows)

01:01:58.841 --> 01:01:59.800
Oh!

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:03.178
(suspenseful catchy music)

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:34.918
- Yeah, a straight
flush is gonna beat

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:37.504
a full house any day.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.969
Well, isn't that convenient?

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.058
Alright.

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:55.772
(Marcus laughs)

01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:58.775
(catchy drum music)

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.079
- Tulsa!

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:13.248
Wake up.

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:17.628
Wake up, Tulsa.

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:24.760
- Good morning, Jim.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:25.802
- Morning?

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.639
It's after lunch, Tulsa.

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:32.726
- I guess I was out a
little later than I thought.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.145
- We need to talk.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:38.440
- To be honest, Jim,

01:03:38.524 --> 01:03:40.859
now is not the best time.

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:44.238
I got a little
bit of a headache.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:46.907
Speaking of which--

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.991
- It's over.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:52.079
- Okay.

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:55.999
- [Jim] What is this?

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.042
- They're just painkillers,

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.878
they're for my aches
and my pains, Jim.

01:04:00.963 --> 01:04:02.130
- And this explains it?

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.509
- Relax, it was
just a bull, Jim.

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:07.010
That's all, just a little bull.

01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:07.844
- What?

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:12.933
- What, a bunch of drug dealers

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:14.309
call the cops on me?

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:16.812
Look, I tell you what,

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.939
you should've seen
the way they just,

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:22.109
seriously, they flew out
of them windows, just...

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.360
(Tulsa whistles)

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:25.779
- I am talking about this!

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.700
Oh, let me help you out here.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.451
You failed your drug test!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:33.829
- Failed?

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:35.872
How?

01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:37.374
- Drugs, Tulsa.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.586
You have drugs in your system,

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:41.378
don't you get it?

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.255
- I just told you, Jim.

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:45.340
I have a prescription, okay?

01:04:45.424 --> 01:04:46.174
- Seriously?

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:51.013
Your levels are off the chart.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:52.973
- You got anything
to wash it down with?

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:54.891
- Only addicts have
levels that high.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:57.769
Not to mention, the alcohol,

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.896
you might not want to drink

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.566
before you take
the test next time!

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.359
- You need to lower
your voice, Jim.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:08.447
- It's over.

01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:13.744
When the media
gets ahold of this,

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:16.538
and they will get ahold
of it, we're screwed.

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:18.874
- Jim, come on now.

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:20.917
Who cares what the media thinks?

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.588
- Oh, you really are
stupid, aren't you?

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:26.882
This is about Gangbanger.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:29.092
You just lost your
million dollar ride.

01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:30.761
- What are you
talking about, Jim?

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.220
- I'm talking about you.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.348
Find yourself a new agent,

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.058
I'm done standing
next to a fool.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.945
(melancholic music)

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:58.789
- Ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.499
At this time, we
would like to present

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:01.917
our man of the year award,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.378
to the reigning bull riding
champion of the world,

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.088
Mr. Tulsa Hughes.

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:09.091
(audience claps)

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:31.363
- It's a real pleasure
to be here tonight,

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:33.115
thank you for coming.

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:37.828
Cause us bull riders,
we're not big on talking.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.376
I mean, I have to
thank my beautiful,

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:47.212
incredible wife, Jessica
here for supporting me.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.133
She puts up with me,

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.510
and it's not easy to be the wife

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:54.428
of a bull rider.

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:56.054
You hear?

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:04.146
She gave me the greatest
blessing of my life.

01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:07.566
My son, Duncan.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.112
I love you, buddy.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.493
Thank you, thank you.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:22.247
(audience claps)

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:35.218
Hey, here, come here.

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:37.179
Hold that for me.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:40.056
(lighthearted music)

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.190
You look good in that hat.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:50.984
Now, come here.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:03.872
- Looking more and
more like your dad.

01:08:05.207 --> 01:08:06.500
Hey, world champion bull rider,

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:09.044
you got plans later tonight?

01:08:09.127 --> 01:08:10.962
- I might be able to fix
you into my schedule.

01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:12.339
- You know, I ain't never seen

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:13.548
a more handsome cowboy.

01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:15.675
You clean up pretty good.

01:08:16.468 --> 01:08:18.511
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.721
Might I add, you're not
too shabby yourself.

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:22.265
- Tulsa, watch out!

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.487
(dark music)

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:49.584
- Where's Duncan?

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.545
- [Man] It's alright
buddy, just relax.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.129
I've already called for help.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.381
- [Duncan] Daddy, help me!

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.134
Help, daddy!

01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:01.136
- [Tulsa] I can hear him.

01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:05.140
- [Duncan] Please Daddy help me,

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:07.602
help me, Daddy, please!

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.689
(explosion booms)

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:13.649
- [Man] You can't go in there!

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.319
(Tulsa yells)

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:18.321
- Duncan!

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.201
(Tulsa yells)

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:28.747
Duncan.

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:41.928
Duncan!

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:44.598
Duncan.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.706
(somber music)

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:12.352
(Tulsa sighs)

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:15.188
The first time on
a bull, I was...

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:18.608
I was 10 years old.

01:11:21.069 --> 01:11:22.237
His name was Lightning.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.742
It wasn't as bad as you,

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:30.954
I mean, I was a 10 year old kid.

01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:39.546
Yeah, I've lasted
the entire eight.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.466
That was it, it was in my blood.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.597
I never even thought about
doing anything different.

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:58.273
You know, it wasn't
for the likes,

01:11:58.356 --> 01:11:59.524
it wasn't for the cheers.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.698
It was for the ride, you know?

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:10.744
Just the thrill of doing it.

01:12:15.165 --> 01:12:17.375
You know all about
the thrill, don't you?

01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:18.209
Hm?

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:24.924
People say eight seconds
ain't a long time,

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:26.176
they ain't never done it

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:27.886
on the back of no
bull, I tell you that.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:39.397
You know, I didn't want
to ride you anyway.

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.567
I ain't scared of you.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:46.446
I've ridden worse than you.

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:54.871
You know, people thought
I did it for the money,

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:00.960
like I even care about
the money, you know?

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.463
Other people thought I
did it to settle a score.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.555
(intense music)

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:20.355
Yeah, well, how about we
settle the score right now.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.529
How they say, put a
cap up in your head.

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:30.406
(intense music)

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:33.618
- What you doing, Tulsa?

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:35.912
- Just evening things up.

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:49.300
- [Buck] Nah.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:51.469
This ain't your style.

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:55.348
- It is today.

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:03.690
- I think the thing that
has amazed me the most

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:06.401
through the years is watching
the love-hate relationship

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.653
between bulls and bull riders.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:14.617
Guess it's their respect
for each other, hm?

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:19.455
2,000 pounds of bull.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:24.502
What, 170 pounds of rider?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:29.674
Eight seconds of
intense violence.

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:35.221
But they have to
have each other.

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:39.100
Like darkness has to have light.

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:45.565
Nah.

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:48.818
Killing him won't
change anything.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.406
And it won't make
you feel any better.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.752
But there is another option.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:08.713
Marcus.

01:15:11.633 --> 01:15:14.344
(somber music)

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.264
- If Marcus tried
to ride this bull,

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:22.560
it looks like I
ain't the only one

01:15:22.644 --> 01:15:23.728
who's been drinking today.

01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:26.272
- Hey, if you trained him.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:29.692
- Yeah, some unproven rider

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:31.486
against the world's
baddest bull,

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:34.739
get real, Buck.

01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:38.576
- Yeah, you're probably right.

01:15:40.662 --> 01:15:42.288
You're not that
good of a trainer.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.129
- Ain't workin', Buck.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.883
Besides, he ain't
never gonna go for it.

01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:54.717
- Maybe not.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:59.222
Bt then again, it's the
perfect underdog story.

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:03.351
Ex-con versus
world's baddest bull.

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:05.061
Bad versus bad.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:10.650
Hey, everyone needs
a second chance.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.527
- Second chances are overrated.

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:15.989
- Not always.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:19.075
You know, I sat
back and watched you

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.576
spiral out of control.

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:26.416
I guess I figured it
wasn't any of my business.

01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:29.210
And I figured you probably

01:16:29.294 --> 01:16:30.461
wouldn't listen anyway.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:36.009
So, I saw the world's best

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:39.679
become a beat up has-been.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:46.019
I know you, son.

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:50.606
I know the old Tulsa,

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.608
the young kid with big dreams.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:00.616
- He died, on the side
of a road one night.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.077
- A part of all of us
died that night, Tulsa.

01:17:04.329 --> 01:17:05.580
I just don't think
you ever saw past

01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:08.374
your own pain enough
to notice that.

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:09.959
- What do you know
about pain, Buck?

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.796
- Probably not as much as you.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:19.469
But I know that holding all
that pain in will destroy you.

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:22.889
Even an old man with poor vision

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.515
can see the trail of destruction

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:25.683
you're leaving behind.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.564
It's time to get your
eyes off your past, Tulsa.

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.109
- There ain't nothing else.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.488
- So, what?

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:39.697
You're just gonna continue?

01:17:41.074 --> 01:17:42.742
Nah, you've tried it your way,

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:43.701
where'd it get you?

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:50.208
You might be shocked at
what helping others will do.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.587
- That's just what I need, huh?

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.172
Another person to tell me that.

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.885
- Hey, if you're in it for
more than one person...

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:09.852
Hey, look.

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:14.273
Just talk to him.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.736
See if he's worth the effort.

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:22.865
(somber music)

01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:49.809
- Buck said you
wanted to see me?

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:08.953
- I grew up in one of the
poorest parts of Louisiana.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.706
And I worked them cotton fields

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:12.999
with my older brothers.

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:18.087
We started when the sun came up,

01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:19.755
finished just before dark.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:23.759
My dad was a good man,

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:24.969
who believed in hard work,

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:26.888
worked hard until
the day he died.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:30.892
He never took no charity,

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:32.018
thought it was an insult.

01:19:34.187 --> 01:19:35.438
It was manhood.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.984
Even though that meant we
went to bed hungry sometimes,

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:41.110
sometimes we did.

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:48.201
And I promise we'd
get out of there.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:51.829
You know, make something better,

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:53.998
get out of them fields,
someway, somehow.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:02.256
The kids these days,
they don't know

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.966
what it means to work hard.

01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:09.805
They expect everything
to be handed to them,

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:11.682
given right to them.

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:15.019
Yeah.

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:22.443
He never gave me
nothing, I paid my dues.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:29.867
- When I was five,
my dad got arrested.

01:20:30.952 --> 01:20:31.744
Went to prison.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.748
Left my mom alone to raise
five kids by herself.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:38.960
She worked two jobs to feed me,

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:40.169
my brothers, and sisters.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.339
None of them had
graduated high school.

01:20:44.215 --> 01:20:46.384
Being that I was the youngest,

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:47.885
I promised my momma I would.

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:53.724
Both of my sisters,
they were pregnant

01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:55.893
before they turned 16.

01:20:55.977 --> 01:20:59.438
And I grew up watching
men abuse my momma.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:07.989
When I was 18, I came home,

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:11.659
and found a man raping my momma.

01:21:14.287 --> 01:21:19.166
I was so high, I don't
remember exactly what I did.

01:21:22.128 --> 01:21:23.504
But I do remember thinking

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:27.049
nobody would ever
hurt my momma again.

01:21:32.972 --> 01:21:34.098
You know, I spent my whole life

01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:35.766
trying to make my momma proud.

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:41.147
Instead, I became a felon.

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:45.860
- So, are you trying to tell me

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.362
you went to prison for
defending your mom?

01:21:50.698 --> 01:21:53.075
- I got locked up because
I had a record a mile long,

01:21:53.159 --> 01:21:54.201
and a court appointed attorney

01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:56.078
that didn't care much.

01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:57.705
Besides, most of
them folks in there

01:21:57.788 --> 01:22:00.041
just thought my momma
was making that stuff up,

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.042
to try to protect me.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.712
She's trying to protect me.

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:13.054
Nah, they just thought I was
another troubled black kid.

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.309
- Is this the part
where you try to tell me

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.645
you wish you had
a mentor, Marcus?

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:21.812
(chuckles)

01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:22.980
- Nah.

01:22:23.064 --> 01:22:24.607
I had mentors.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:25.650
Just the wrong kind.

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:30.071
And believe it or not,
prison was good for me.

01:22:31.656 --> 01:22:32.948
Yup.

01:22:33.032 --> 01:22:34.950
I met a guy in there
that believed in me.

01:22:36.911 --> 01:22:40.498
Thought I had worth, value.

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:44.794
Helped me turn my life around.

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:49.256
Yup, strange as it sounds,

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:53.135
prison was good for me.

01:22:53.219 --> 01:22:54.929
Not saying I want to go back,

01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:56.555
'cause I ain't
saying that at all.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:15.866
- So, what makes you think
you deserve a shot, hm?

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:19.203
- Honestly, I don't think I do.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.164
- Then why are you--

01:23:22.248 --> 01:23:23.791
- Aw, that's just something
Buck came up with.

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:26.669
- You don't want to
ride him then, huh?

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.087
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.131
I never said that either.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.632
Yeah, I want a shot at him.

01:23:31.716 --> 01:23:32.675
What rider wouldn't?

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:35.219
But deserve?

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.222
Nah.

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:39.181
I don't deserve it.

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:50.943
- Your ma, is she still alive?

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:55.406
- [Marcus] Yeah.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.658
Still going strong.

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:03.789
- Well, I guess it's time
we made her proud, huh?

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:06.417
(hopeful music)

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.205
- Savannah, I'm
heading to lunch.

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:45.331
Any messages?

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.082
- Yes, here you go.

01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:49.502
(tense music)

01:24:57.343 --> 01:24:58.594
- [Jim] I don't want
to even hear it.

01:24:58.677 --> 01:24:59.887
- I've been trying to
call you for days, Jim.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.639
- I threw away my phone.

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:04.308
(phone rings)

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:06.477
Jim Hawkins.

01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:08.270
Hey, go ahead.

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:12.107
- Look, he's gonna
call you back.

01:25:16.654 --> 01:25:19.073
- Listen to me closely.

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:20.115
It's over.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:22.827
You don't need an agent,

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:26.539
you need an attorney,
maybe a psychiatrist.

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:27.706
As soon as the judge finds out

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.291
that you failed your drug test,

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:31.210
he's probably gonna
put you in jail.

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:32.211
- Hear me out, Jim.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.174
I'm not here about me, okay?

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:39.802
- Not about you?

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:44.431
That would be a first.

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:48.686
We are sad to announce
that Tulsa Hughes

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:50.187
will not be able to compete

01:25:50.271 --> 01:25:52.648
in the million dollar
challenge to ride Gangbanger.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.483
- Tulsa, are you hurt?

01:25:54.567 --> 01:25:56.151
- Will it be rescheduled?

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:57.152
- Hear me out.

01:25:58.404 --> 01:25:59.780
While we're sad that Tulsa
will not be competing,

01:25:59.864 --> 01:26:01.532
we do have a replacement.

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:04.118
A replacement that
Tulsa will help train

01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:05.202
for the event.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.247
Actually, we believe
that this will be

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.124
a very compelling replacement.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:13.252
One that will not only
bring a lot of controversy,

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.671
but also a lot of excitement.

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:19.383
At this time, I'd like to
introduce Mr. Marcus Cruz.

01:26:22.261 --> 01:26:23.304
- Marcus, are you currently

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:24.722
on the pro tour right now?

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:29.351
- (clears throat) No, I'm not.

01:26:29.435 --> 01:26:32.021
- How many years have you
spent riding professionally?

01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:32.897
- Actually, none.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.316
- Tell us about your career.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:37.943
- I rode some back
in high school,

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:41.363
and then some when I
was just in prison.

01:26:41.447 --> 01:26:42.406
- Prison?

01:26:42.489 --> 01:26:44.366
Is this some kind
of publicity stunt?

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:47.119
- No, Mr. Cruz is
a legitimate rider,

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.371
and a solid opponent
for Gangbanger.

01:26:49.455 --> 01:26:51.540
- Marcus, did I
understand you correctly?

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:53.959
Did you spend some
time in prison?

01:26:54.043 --> 01:26:55.753
- Yeah, I was recently released.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.422
- Okay, is this a joke?

01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:00.633
Bill, do you support this?

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.092
- As owner of Gangbanger,

01:27:02.176 --> 01:27:04.303
I decide who gets to ride him.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:05.971
I've checked this kid out,

01:27:06.055 --> 01:27:07.473
and he gets a chance.

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:09.642
A second chance, if you want.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:11.852
He's paid his debt to society,

01:27:11.936 --> 01:27:13.395
and he's paid his entry fee.

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:16.607
- Okay, so you're saying
it's all about the money.

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.984
- All I'm saying
is this is America.

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:22.112
Where second chances are
given, and cash is accepted.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:23.864
- Tulsa.

01:27:23.948 --> 01:27:25.658
What do you think of this idea?

01:27:27.034 --> 01:27:28.369
- I've seen him ride.

01:27:28.452 --> 01:27:29.411
Kid's got a shot.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:32.748
- You don't sound
too convincing.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.835
- Well, I watched this
bull kill a close friend,

01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:40.297
so let's just say I'm cautious.

01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:43.300
- Like I said before,

01:27:43.384 --> 01:27:45.761
Tulsa along with Buck,

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:48.931
will be helping Marcus
prepare for the event.

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:51.225
He couldn't have
better trainers.

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.893
- Buck.

01:27:52.977 --> 01:27:55.312
What's it like working with
such an inexperienced rider

01:27:55.396 --> 01:27:58.065
in an event of such magnitude?

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:00.776
- Well, I've known
Marcus for years,

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:03.529
and I think he just
might shock some folks.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:05.239
- Tell us about
yourself, Marcus.

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:06.407
Are you married?

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:07.866
Do you have children
of your own?

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:11.954
- That's enough
questions for now.

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.288
We'll be sending out press kits

01:28:13.372 --> 01:28:15.249
with all you need to
know about Mr. Cruz.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:16.083
Thank you.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.843
(somber music)

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:06.425
- What is this?

01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:09.261
- What do you think it is?

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:10.304
The judge doesn't
want you to have

01:29:10.387 --> 01:29:11.305
any contact with Indiana,

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:14.141
and honestly I agree.

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:14.933
- Who cares what you think?

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:16.560
The either of you two.

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:18.604
- It's always about
you, isn't it?

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:20.147
- You could've called me.

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:21.482
- Do you have a phone?

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:24.359
- You know where I live, Ann.

01:29:24.443 --> 01:29:26.195
- And have this
argument at your place?

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:28.030
No thank you, I feel
much safer here.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:29.698
Besides, it's policy
to have it in writing.

01:29:29.782 --> 01:29:31.200
- So you're just gonna
rip another person

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:32.451
out of his life, huh?

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:33.619
- Don't try to turn this
around on me, Tulsa.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:34.953
You did this.

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:38.373
- Nobody's gonna tell me
who I can and can't see.

01:29:38.457 --> 01:29:40.209
- Tulsa, you really
need to figure out

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:41.418
where your life is headed.

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:42.711
- Save it for
somebody else, okay?

01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:44.713
Besides, like you
have it all together?

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:47.257
- Do you remember when I said

01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:48.801
I'd made some
changes in my life?

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:52.763
Well, the main one was in
my relationship with God.

01:29:56.767 --> 01:29:57.601
- God, seriously?

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:00.562
- I knew you
wouldn't understand,

01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:03.107
it's exactly why I
didn't say anything.

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:04.399
- You know how many people

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:06.193
tried to tell me
about Jesus, huh?

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:07.319
How much he loved me?

01:30:08.779 --> 01:30:11.073
Where was he that night on
the side of the road, Ann?

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:11.907
Huh?

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:13.909
Answer that!

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:16.537
- Tulsa, I don't
have all the answers.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.498
- And until you do,
I'm fine the way I am.

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:22.584
- [Ann] Tulsa, we really
need to find you some help.

01:30:22.668 --> 01:30:23.585
I know--

01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:24.503
- We?

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:25.420
What are you, my manager now?

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:26.255
Huh?

01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:30.509
I don't need your help.

01:30:32.386 --> 01:30:33.345
- Tulsa.

01:30:39.518 --> 01:30:41.436
(knocking)

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.189
(somber music)

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:52.614
- Ma'am.

01:30:54.366 --> 01:30:55.492
- And what do you want?

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:59.037
- I just, I came to see Indiana.

01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:02.416
- Ms. Shaw already called.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.711
Said you weren't allowed
to see him no more.

01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:10.966
Here I was thinking you
was gonna be different.

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:14.219
- I just want to tell
him myself, okay?

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:15.762
I figure it's the
right thing to do.

01:31:15.846 --> 01:31:20.225
- Right thing to do?

01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:21.560
The right thing to do

01:31:21.643 --> 01:31:24.730
is not let my boy hang
around somebody on drugs.

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:29.776
- I'm not on drugs, okay?

01:31:35.574 --> 01:31:37.701
Look, can I just see him?

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:39.536
Please?

01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:58.555
Hey, man.

01:31:58.639 --> 01:31:59.306
- Hey.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.812
- Look, I'm not gonna
be able to keep on.

01:32:05.896 --> 01:32:07.105
- Yeah.

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:09.274
My momma already told me.

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:11.568
- Yeah.

01:32:15.489 --> 01:32:18.492
I just wanted to tell
you myself though, okay?

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:19.701
You know?

01:32:19.785 --> 01:32:24.748
Maybe after, you know,

01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:29.544
maybe things will change.

01:32:29.628 --> 01:32:30.629
Okay?

01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:32.756
- Yeah.

01:32:32.839 --> 01:32:33.590
I understand.

01:32:37.594 --> 01:32:38.387
- Yeah.

01:32:39.596 --> 01:32:41.473
You know, look, I wanted
to give you something

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.642
that had belonged to you,

01:32:44.851 --> 01:32:46.520
I wanted to give it back.

01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:47.562
Remember, right?

01:32:47.646 --> 01:32:49.773
every cowboy has to
have a cowboy hat.

01:32:49.856 --> 01:32:51.733
- Has to have a cowboy hat.

01:32:51.817 --> 01:32:53.026
- That's right, okay?

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:54.611
So whenever you
wear that, alright,

01:32:54.695 --> 01:32:56.655
I want you to think
of us, alright?

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.156
Our friendship, you and me.

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:00.993
You promise me that?

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:01.827
- Yes.

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:10.669
(somber music)

01:33:18.802 --> 01:33:22.014
Come on now, cowboys
don't cry, right?

01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:27.102
Look, I gotta go.

01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:28.437
I promised someone I'd help them

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.148
with their bull riding.

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:33.025
- Can I go with you?

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:35.319
- [Tulsa] Ah, that's
probably not a good idea.

01:33:35.402 --> 01:33:36.611
- Mom, can I please?

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:38.405
- Indiana, wait.

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:39.406
They said--

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:40.574
- Wait, look.

01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:44.703
I decide who my
child's with, alright?

01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:47.247
- Yes, ma'am.

01:33:57.549 --> 01:33:58.842
- He got to be home by seven.

01:34:02.929 --> 01:34:05.640
What you waiting for, cowboy?

01:34:05.724 --> 01:34:07.100
Some kind of bell or something?

01:34:08.185 --> 01:34:08.977
- No, ma'am.

01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:13.732
How about we go before
she changes her mind, huh?

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:14.775
- [Indiana] Okay.

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:15.609
- Okay, let's hurry.

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:22.032
Put that up on that head, eh?

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.205
Watch that puddle now, alright?

01:34:28.288 --> 01:34:29.915
Get on up there okay?

01:34:36.797 --> 01:34:39.341
- There you go, ride
him, ride him, ride up!

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:40.509
Yeah!

01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:41.885
(laughs)

01:34:41.968 --> 01:34:43.553
He's still got it.

01:34:44.805 --> 01:34:46.139
- Yeah, well,
let's not crown him

01:34:46.223 --> 01:34:49.309
world champion
quite yet, alright?

01:34:49.393 --> 01:34:51.311
- [Buck] Great ride, Marcus.

01:34:51.395 --> 01:34:52.729
That's a wrap for today, boys.

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.775
- What'd you think?

01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:58.735
- Well, you better
keep them hips forward.

01:34:58.819 --> 01:35:00.821
- Hey, while you guys talk about

01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:02.739
all this bull riding stuff,

01:35:02.823 --> 01:35:04.658
me and Indiana are
gonna go get us

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:05.659
something cold to drink

01:35:05.742 --> 01:35:07.702
before he has to head home.

01:35:07.786 --> 01:35:09.246
You probably don't know this,

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:10.747
but your momma used to play

01:35:10.831 --> 01:35:12.999
with my daughter
when they were kids.

01:35:13.083 --> 01:35:15.877
The two of them were
thick as thieves.

01:35:17.254 --> 01:35:18.797
- My momma was a thief?

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.132
- Not exactly.

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:21.883
Come on, I'll tell
you all about it.

01:35:21.967 --> 01:35:24.010
(laughs)

01:35:33.103 --> 01:35:34.563
- You know, these bulls
ain't nothing like

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:36.523
what you're gonna
experience on Gangbanger.

01:35:37.441 --> 01:35:38.692
He's in another league.

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:39.776
- Yeah.

01:35:41.111 --> 01:35:42.112
I know that.

01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:44.573
- Well, I'm sure you do.

01:35:46.616 --> 01:35:47.409
Hey.

01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:49.786
Are you taking this serious?

01:35:50.871 --> 01:35:51.830
- Of course I am.

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:55.292
What's the deal with you?

01:35:55.375 --> 01:35:57.002
I thought you wanted
me to do this.

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:00.172
- This ain't some
prison rodeo, Marcus.

01:36:02.591 --> 01:36:04.426
- Why don't you just
speak your mind?

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.222
- Look, you got decent
technique, alright?

01:36:09.306 --> 01:36:10.724
Looks like you got
the physical strength,

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:14.895
but do you have what it takes?

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.859
I've been interviewed
a thousand times

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:22.861
about riding bulls,

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:24.196
asking me all
kinds of questions,

01:36:24.279 --> 01:36:25.989
what separates the great ones

01:36:26.072 --> 01:36:27.574
from all the others, huh?

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:31.786
I tell them, tell them
every time, all the time,

01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:33.914
same thing, they
just don't get it.

01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:41.922
You gotta want it.

01:36:42.005 --> 01:36:43.840
You gotta want it
more than you want

01:36:43.924 --> 01:36:45.592
anything else in the world.

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:50.472
Sometimes, it's
better to die trying

01:36:50.555 --> 01:36:52.182
than to live with
yourself for not.

01:36:55.227 --> 01:36:56.019
You get that?

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.069
They all say they want it.

01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:05.362
They say they want it.

01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:07.697
Sure, it's easy to say
you want something.

01:37:09.574 --> 01:37:11.743
But you know what
keeps it from them?

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:14.955
Fear.

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:19.626
It ain't getting rid
of the fear, though.

01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:20.877
Alright?

01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:22.921
You feed off of the fear.

01:37:24.506 --> 01:37:25.382
Right?

01:37:25.465 --> 01:37:27.175
You use it to your advantage.

01:37:31.555 --> 01:37:33.056
You ever been really afraid?

01:37:37.686 --> 01:37:38.478
- Yeah.

01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:40.855
Once.

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:43.567
When I was 18.

01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:48.947
I had to walk into a
maximum security prison.

01:37:55.245 --> 01:37:58.081
- Well, I guess you just
got it then, don't you?

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.170
- I understand what you're
talking about though.

01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:08.216
Fear, using its strength.

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:14.222
Yeah, growing up, I was
filled with that fear.

01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:16.975
On the inside.

01:38:18.393 --> 01:38:19.644
But I never let it show.

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:22.439
Not if I wanted to survive.

01:38:24.524 --> 01:38:26.735
I looked for that fear
in the eyes of others,

01:38:26.818 --> 01:38:27.986
and I fed off of it.

01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:32.866
Trying to be that
baddest, the bravest.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:37.871
There's always somebody
badder, meaner.

01:38:38.872 --> 01:38:43.293
There's always a gang banger,

01:38:43.376 --> 01:38:44.628
trying to prove himself.

01:38:45.879 --> 01:38:48.506
Throw you to the ground,
stomp on your head.

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:50.008
Yeah.

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:50.842
I know fear.

01:38:52.844 --> 01:38:55.889
And I know it will
destroy you too.

01:38:58.058 --> 01:39:00.018
But I traded in
the spirit of fear.

01:39:00.977 --> 01:39:03.104
Traded it in for
a spirit of peace.

01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:09.110
(Tulsa laughs)

01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:12.155
- The spirit of peace.

01:39:14.824 --> 01:39:16.493
Why don't you save the sermon

01:39:16.576 --> 01:39:19.371
for someone else
there, Pastor Marcus.

01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:21.039
Alright?

01:39:21.122 --> 01:39:22.082
Spirit of peace.

01:39:22.165 --> 01:39:23.625
- [Marcus] I know
about your son.

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:29.881
And I know my prison experience

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:31.966
was nothing compared to
what you've been through.

01:39:34.803 --> 01:39:35.970
- You have no idea.

01:39:37.138 --> 01:39:37.931
- You're right.

01:39:38.765 --> 01:39:40.141
I don't.

01:39:40.225 --> 01:39:42.435
But I know a man in
prison when I see one.

01:39:42.519 --> 01:39:44.062
- This ain't prison.

01:39:48.358 --> 01:39:49.150
It's hell.

01:40:06.626 --> 01:40:08.586
- Where's Tulsa going?

01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:09.754
- Something came up.

01:40:10.964 --> 01:40:13.216
- But, we were gonna
get burgers and fries.

01:40:13.299 --> 01:40:15.009
That's what we like.

01:40:15.093 --> 01:40:17.887
- Yeah, well, I
don't think Tulsa's

01:40:17.971 --> 01:40:20.265
in any condition to
take you anywhere today.

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:21.683
- Is he sick or something?

01:40:24.102 --> 01:40:25.770
- I know what you're thinking.

01:40:25.854 --> 01:40:27.188
He can't be your daddy.

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:39.492
- I ain't never had
no daddy no way.

01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:43.246
(somber music)

01:40:54.799 --> 01:40:55.550
- Lil man.

01:40:56.801 --> 01:40:58.136
Sometimes...

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:03.224
The people that
disappoint you the most,

01:41:05.185 --> 01:41:07.562
are the ones that
love you the most.

01:41:07.645 --> 01:41:09.939
And just because it looks
like they've given up on you,

01:41:10.023 --> 01:41:12.192
you don't ever give up on them.

01:41:14.903 --> 01:41:17.113
'Cause you never know
when they might come back.

01:41:21.993 --> 01:41:23.369
And I also learned

01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:30.752
to keep my chin
up, no matter what.

01:41:42.055 --> 01:41:42.889
Let's go see if we can get Buck

01:41:42.972 --> 01:41:44.224
to give you a ride home.

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:45.308
- He already left.

01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:47.560
- Did he now?

01:41:49.479 --> 01:41:50.230
Okay.

01:41:53.233 --> 01:41:55.443
What you say I give
you a ride home?

01:41:55.527 --> 01:41:57.529
- Momma said I can't
ride with strangers.

01:41:59.364 --> 01:42:00.532
Well, my name is--

01:42:00.615 --> 01:42:02.492
- I know what your
name is, Tulsa told me.

01:42:03.409 --> 01:42:04.202
- He did.

01:42:07.247 --> 01:42:08.623
What else did he tell you?

01:42:09.874 --> 01:42:11.835
- He told me you were
gonna ride Gangbanger.

01:42:13.253 --> 01:42:14.587
- Okay.

01:42:14.671 --> 01:42:17.757
Well, now that we know
each other's names,

01:42:18.883 --> 01:42:20.134
we're not strangers anymore.

01:42:22.846 --> 01:42:24.305
- Okay.

01:42:24.389 --> 01:42:27.058
But you have to give me
something to eat on the way.

01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:29.519
My momma doesn't like
when I come home hungry.

01:42:29.602 --> 01:42:31.229
(laughs)

01:42:31.312 --> 01:42:32.397
- Alright, deal.

01:42:34.816 --> 01:42:36.568
Come on, let me
go get changed up.

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:40.196
Come on.

01:43:00.842 --> 01:43:02.927
- Mom, this is Marcus.

01:43:03.011 --> 01:43:04.345
He rides bulls too.

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:05.972
- Wow.

01:43:09.309 --> 01:43:11.686
Why don't you head
on in and clean up?

01:43:11.769 --> 01:43:13.271
- Momma, he's not
a stranger anymore.

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:14.230
- You heard me.

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:17.191
- Yes, ma'am.

01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:27.327
- Look, what is all of this?

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:28.578
- Hey, I can explain.

01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:29.370
- No.

01:43:29.454 --> 01:43:30.955
I told you to stay away.

01:43:31.998 --> 01:43:32.790
- Come on, Vee.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.543
Can't you see how
much he wants a man?

01:43:35.627 --> 01:43:37.170
A father in his life?

01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:39.839
- Don't you lecture me
on how to raise my son.

01:43:41.049 --> 01:43:42.216
Besides, you ain't
the kind of man

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:43.384
I want him hanging with.

01:43:43.468 --> 01:43:44.427
- Oh, it's alright
for him to hang out

01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:45.553
with an addict though?

01:43:45.637 --> 01:43:47.472
- Like you're any
different than him?

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:48.806
You know what?

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:50.183
You tell that bull
rider to stay away

01:43:50.266 --> 01:43:51.100
from my boy too.

01:43:51.184 --> 01:43:52.143
You're just another lying man.

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:53.436
- Vee, Vee, Vee, Vee!

01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:54.270
Please.

01:43:56.856 --> 01:44:00.193
I just want to spend
some time with our son.

01:44:00.276 --> 01:44:03.196
- Did you tell him that?

01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:05.239
Did you tell him that
you're his father?

01:44:05.323 --> 01:44:06.240
- No.

01:44:06.324 --> 01:44:07.408
I just drove him home.

01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:09.702
But look, Vee.

01:44:09.786 --> 01:44:11.913
I've got a right to
see him, he's my son.

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:15.333
- No.

01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:16.876
I'm not gonna let you do to him

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.920
what you did to me.

01:44:19.003 --> 01:44:20.046
- I was just a kid then!

01:44:20.129 --> 01:44:21.214
That was over 10 years ago,

01:44:21.297 --> 01:44:22.465
I'm a man now!

01:44:27.428 --> 01:44:29.722
I'm a changed man.

01:44:29.806 --> 01:44:31.307
- Yeah.

01:44:31.391 --> 01:44:32.976
And after you spend the
next 10 years proving that,

01:44:33.059 --> 01:44:34.811
then maybe we can talk.

01:44:39.107 --> 01:44:42.110
Marcus, just please leave.

01:44:45.822 --> 01:44:46.698
- You can try to run me off

01:44:46.781 --> 01:44:48.700
as much as you want, Vee.

01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:52.328
I'm not giving up on my son.

01:44:53.746 --> 01:44:57.375
(intense emotional music)

01:45:08.302 --> 01:45:11.431
- Momma, why don't
you like that man?

01:45:51.095 --> 01:45:52.513
- What kinda pies
ya'll got today?

01:45:52.597 --> 01:45:57.560
- Uh, we've got pecan, coconut,
and chocolate meringue.

01:46:00.396 --> 01:46:01.606
- I'll take a slice of
that chocolate meringue,

01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:03.441
and a cup of coffee
if you'll sit with me

01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:04.525
while I eat.

01:46:06.986 --> 01:46:08.321
- What is you doing here?

01:46:08.404 --> 01:46:10.698
- Can't an uncle visit
his favorite niece?

01:46:10.782 --> 01:46:12.450
(Vee laughs)

01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:13.743
- You ain't my uncle.

01:46:13.826 --> 01:46:16.245
- All them hours spent
in my house growing up,

01:46:16.329 --> 01:46:17.622
might as well be.

01:46:17.705 --> 01:46:19.540
Come on, come visit with me.

01:46:19.624 --> 01:46:20.792
- Can't.

01:46:20.875 --> 01:46:21.959
My shift's almost up,

01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:23.836
and I got to get
home to Indiana.

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:25.338
- It won't take but a minute.

01:46:25.421 --> 01:46:28.174
Besides, I want to talk
with you about him.

01:46:28.257 --> 01:46:29.092
- Something happen?

01:46:29.175 --> 01:46:31.469
- No, no, I just wanna visit.

01:46:32.553 --> 01:46:33.304
Now, come on.

01:46:33.387 --> 01:46:34.138
Let's sit.

01:46:37.558 --> 01:46:38.976
- Aye, Cheryl.

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:40.103
Can you cover for me?

01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.950
So, what's up?

01:46:55.118 --> 01:46:56.786
- Alright, I'll
get straight to it.

01:46:58.579 --> 01:46:59.831
It's about Marcus.

01:46:59.914 --> 01:47:01.124
- Not you too.

01:47:01.207 --> 01:47:02.458
- [Buck] Vee, I know
what you're thinking.

01:47:02.542 --> 01:47:03.501
- Really?

01:47:03.584 --> 01:47:04.460
I seriously doubt it.

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.588
Did he put you up to this?

01:47:07.672 --> 01:47:10.299
- No, no, not really.

01:47:10.383 --> 01:47:12.927
He didn't ask me to
talk to you but--

01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:14.220
- You forgot everything?

01:47:15.221 --> 01:47:17.640
He left me, pregnant.

01:47:17.723 --> 01:47:19.016
I was 17 years old.

01:47:19.892 --> 01:47:21.561
Told me all them lies.

01:47:21.644 --> 01:47:22.937
- [Buck] The truth is--

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:25.731
- No, the truth is, he left
me to raise a child on my own.

01:47:25.815 --> 01:47:27.692
- Vee, he's a changed man.

01:47:29.569 --> 01:47:31.445
- You got that from him, huh?

01:47:31.529 --> 01:47:32.905
- I seen it first hand.

01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:35.241
God has changed that boy.

01:47:36.701 --> 01:47:38.327
- Huh?

01:47:38.411 --> 01:47:39.120
Good for him.

01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:41.622
- [Buck] Vee.

01:47:42.498 --> 01:47:44.500
Indiana needs a
father a in his life.

01:47:44.584 --> 01:47:46.294
- Oh, well, Marcus
should've thought about that

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:47.378
10 years ago.

01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:48.796
- Vee, you're not being fair.

01:47:49.839 --> 01:47:51.632
- Don't talk to me about fair.

01:47:51.716 --> 01:47:54.093
Besides, having a
father that come and go

01:47:54.177 --> 01:47:56.012
is worse than not
having one at all.

01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:05.813
I'm not gonna let
him do to Indiana

01:48:05.897 --> 01:48:07.356
what he did to me.

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.656
- Is this what it's about?

01:48:16.616 --> 01:48:18.284
You and Marcus?

01:48:18.367 --> 01:48:20.328
- [Vee] Don't turn
this around on me.

01:48:20.411 --> 01:48:21.162
- Vee.

01:48:22.371 --> 01:48:24.540
Indiana is not gonna
be a boy forever.

01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:28.669
He's gonna need a
man in his life.

01:48:29.962 --> 01:48:31.464
And before long, you're
not gonna be the one

01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:33.966
making the choices about
who he hangs out with.

01:48:37.511 --> 01:48:39.555
- Couldn't you be a
father figure to him?

01:48:41.599 --> 01:48:43.517
- You know it's
not the same thing.

01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:48.439
Vee, the boy needs his father.

01:48:50.358 --> 01:48:52.860
(somber music)

01:48:54.278 --> 01:48:57.031
Now, I'd love a slice of
that chocolate meringue

01:48:57.114 --> 01:48:59.784
if you could see
it in your heart.

01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:03.537
Please?

01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:12.255
Love that chocolate meringue.

01:49:12.338 --> 01:49:13.089
- Aight.

01:49:16.133 --> 01:49:18.719
(hopeful music)

01:49:53.754 --> 01:49:54.505
(dramatic music)

01:49:54.588 --> 01:49:56.132
- Come here, come here!

01:49:56.215 --> 01:49:56.924
Hey.

01:49:57.008 --> 01:49:58.217
- Who's that?

01:49:58.301 --> 01:49:59.385
- Tell the white
boy with the bull

01:49:59.468 --> 01:50:01.220
that his neighborhood
belongs to us.

01:50:01.304 --> 01:50:02.054
Hey, come here.

01:50:03.681 --> 01:50:05.016
- What is he doing?

01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:05.850
No!

01:50:09.312 --> 01:50:10.730
(Vee yells)

01:50:10.813 --> 01:50:11.564
No!

01:50:14.525 --> 01:50:16.193
- Hey, hey.

01:50:16.277 --> 01:50:18.321
Let him know that now we even.

01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:20.239
And it better stay that way,

01:50:20.323 --> 01:50:22.825
because if not, we'll be back.

01:50:25.786 --> 01:50:26.871
- Indiana!

01:50:26.954 --> 01:50:28.622
Indiana!

01:50:28.706 --> 01:50:29.707
Oh God, no, no!

01:50:37.131 --> 01:50:40.426
Marcus, Marcus,
Marcus, Marcus, Marcus.

01:50:42.636 --> 01:50:43.721
Please, Marcus, please,

01:50:43.804 --> 01:50:44.513
help me, you have to come.

01:50:44.597 --> 01:50:45.556
- Hey, hey, slow
down, slow down.

01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:46.515
What you talking about?

01:50:46.599 --> 01:50:47.558
- It's Indiana!

01:50:54.231 --> 01:50:54.982
- Indiana!

01:51:01.906 --> 01:51:03.282
I got you, come on.

01:51:03.366 --> 01:51:05.910
(intense music)

01:51:08.829 --> 01:51:11.665
(Marcus coughs)

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:14.543
Come here.

01:51:14.627 --> 01:51:15.836
He okay, he okay.

01:51:18.422 --> 01:51:19.673
- [Reporter] I have with me now,

01:51:19.757 --> 01:51:22.134
Ms. Velena Williams who
lives inside the home.

01:51:22.218 --> 01:51:23.427
Ms. Williams, do
you have any idea

01:51:23.511 --> 01:51:24.845
how this fire started?

01:51:25.805 --> 01:51:30.309
- I must've left the
stove on or something.

01:51:30.393 --> 01:51:31.852
- Hey, hey, turn that up.

01:51:33.729 --> 01:51:36.690
- [Reporter] Now, the truly
amazing part of this story

01:51:36.774 --> 01:51:39.735
is this man right
here, Mr. Marcus Cruz.

01:51:39.819 --> 01:51:43.072
Mr. Cruz, I understand that
you ran inside the home

01:51:43.155 --> 01:51:45.574
and saved this young boy's life.

01:51:45.658 --> 01:51:46.826
- Yes, ma'am.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:48.869
- [Reporter] And may I
ask why you did that?

01:51:55.835 --> 01:51:56.669
- He's my son.

01:51:58.921 --> 01:52:01.632
(wistful music)

01:52:06.595 --> 01:52:08.305
- There you have
it, reporting live

01:52:08.389 --> 01:52:11.475
from the scene with a true hero.

01:52:11.559 --> 01:52:13.519
I'm Tanya Springs,
for Channel 8 News.

01:52:14.812 --> 01:52:17.398
(wistful music)

01:52:31.954 --> 01:52:34.248
(knocking)

01:52:44.341 --> 01:52:46.343
- Mind if I talk to you?

01:52:49.722 --> 01:52:50.598
- Uh, yeah.

01:52:52.099 --> 01:52:52.850
Come on.

01:52:56.937 --> 01:52:57.938
Want something to drink?

01:52:58.022 --> 01:53:01.066
Ain't got no beer,
but I got some sodas.

01:53:02.026 --> 01:53:02.776
- Nah, nah.

01:53:04.361 --> 01:53:05.154
I'm good.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.495
- I also got some--

01:53:12.578 --> 01:53:14.580
- Uh.

01:53:14.663 --> 01:53:17.374
I saw you on TV.

01:53:21.837 --> 01:53:23.422
That's a great thing you did.

01:53:24.507 --> 01:53:25.299
- Thanks.

01:53:31.639 --> 01:53:33.974
- So, where they staying at now?

01:53:34.058 --> 01:53:36.268
- Well, they headed
over to Buck's.

01:53:36.352 --> 01:53:38.062
I figured it's safer
for them there.

01:53:40.356 --> 01:53:42.274
- That's probably a good idea.

01:53:42.358 --> 01:53:44.652
- Well, actually, I'm
on my way out there now,

01:53:44.735 --> 01:53:47.321
I just came to get a few
things, and then, you know...

01:53:50.658 --> 01:53:52.159
- Look--

01:53:52.243 --> 01:53:53.494
- Look, man, I need to--

01:53:53.577 --> 01:53:54.954
- Let me just...

01:53:58.374 --> 01:53:59.667
Let me just get this out.

01:54:08.509 --> 01:54:13.514
When Duncan, my boy,
when he was about four,

01:54:22.398 --> 01:54:24.525
I got him his very
first cowboy hat.

01:54:27.653 --> 01:54:28.988
God, he loved that hat.

01:54:32.616 --> 01:54:33.993
He wore that thing everywhere.

01:54:36.495 --> 01:54:37.705
He even wore it to bed.

01:54:44.169 --> 01:54:46.880
And I wanted him
to wear his hat,

01:54:49.633 --> 01:54:51.051
but they told me

01:54:56.974 --> 01:54:59.602
they wouldn't open the casket.

01:55:01.437 --> 01:55:03.647
They told me he
was burned too bad.

01:55:11.864 --> 01:55:13.073
I never got to say goodbye.

01:55:19.538 --> 01:55:21.874
You know, people don't
know what to say,

01:55:21.957 --> 01:55:23.292
I mean losing a child, it's...

01:55:28.047 --> 01:55:30.716
I guess, people are too
afraid to say his name,

01:55:30.799 --> 01:55:32.926
you know, because they
thought it would upset me.

01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:35.304
I mean to be fair, I
mean, everything upset me.

01:55:46.398 --> 01:55:51.403
I wanted so bad to hear
someone, just occasionally,

01:55:52.071 --> 01:55:52.613
just say his name.

01:56:00.913 --> 01:56:02.164
I mean, my wife,

01:56:06.085 --> 01:56:07.127
not too long after that,

01:56:07.211 --> 01:56:08.545
what was left of her, I mean,

01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:10.005
she left me too.

01:56:10.089 --> 01:56:11.840
There wasn't much
left of me either,

01:56:11.924 --> 01:56:13.967
you know, I mean.

01:56:16.428 --> 01:56:18.097
You know the first thing I did?

01:56:21.809 --> 01:56:22.643
Rode a bull.

01:56:24.436 --> 01:56:25.562
I mean, shoot, what
else is a bull rider

01:56:25.646 --> 01:56:26.855
supposed to do, right?

01:56:26.939 --> 01:56:28.440
I mean, it's all
I got left, right?

01:56:33.195 --> 01:56:35.698
It was either that or even, ah,

01:56:35.781 --> 01:56:36.490
so I rode.

01:56:41.537 --> 01:56:43.997
You know, the craziest
thing about it is

01:56:44.081 --> 01:56:48.544
I don't even remember
most of those rides.

01:56:59.388 --> 01:57:01.098
About three years
before I hung it up,

01:57:01.181 --> 01:57:03.267
I hurt my shoulder real
bad in Albuquerque,

01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:08.063
and that's when I discovered
them painkillers you...

01:57:14.737 --> 01:57:15.946
They worked for a while, I mean,

01:57:16.029 --> 01:57:17.114
they took away the pain.

01:57:26.498 --> 01:57:27.291
Anyways.

01:57:29.042 --> 01:57:30.169
I'm trying to tell
you I'm proud of you.

01:57:30.252 --> 01:57:31.253
Okay?

01:57:33.213 --> 01:57:34.214
- [Marcus] Thanks.

01:57:34.298 --> 01:57:35.549
- Yeah.

01:57:35.632 --> 01:57:37.760
Tell me, why didn't you tell
me he was your son, huh?

01:57:37.843 --> 01:57:39.052
I mean, come on.

01:57:39.136 --> 01:57:40.763
You could've at least
just been like hey,

01:57:40.846 --> 01:57:42.306
that's my boy.

01:57:42.389 --> 01:57:44.141
- I don't know.

01:57:44.224 --> 01:57:45.184
I just...

01:57:46.643 --> 01:57:47.811
- Look, I understand, okay?

01:57:47.895 --> 01:57:49.229
I get it.

01:57:49.313 --> 01:57:52.274
Shoot, I'd probably had
done the same thing.

01:58:00.616 --> 01:58:02.993
Can you do something for me?

01:58:03.076 --> 01:58:03.827
- Yeah.

01:58:07.581 --> 01:58:11.251
- Just don't let him
get away from you, okay?

01:58:12.252 --> 01:58:13.879
I mean, that kid's a good kid.

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:16.173
- I won't.

01:58:18.258 --> 01:58:20.511
- And that money, I
mean it's enough to

01:58:20.594 --> 01:58:21.845
get him out of
this neighborhood,

01:58:21.929 --> 01:58:23.430
away from that lifestyle
and everything forever,

01:58:23.514 --> 01:58:26.391
so you just promise me, okay?

01:58:26.475 --> 01:58:29.186
Just promise me
you'll do that, okay?

01:58:29.269 --> 01:58:30.020
- I promise.

01:58:32.022 --> 01:58:32.815
- Okay.

01:58:39.279 --> 01:58:40.322
I should...

01:58:43.116 --> 01:58:43.909
I'm gonna go.

01:58:48.163 --> 01:58:51.792
- Thanks for stopping by.

01:58:54.253 --> 01:58:56.004
- Yeah, no problem.

01:58:57.381 --> 01:58:59.967
- I'll see you at
practice tomorrow?

01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:00.926
- Yeah, sure.

01:59:09.935 --> 01:59:11.603
You know you're
gonna do it, right?

01:59:13.897 --> 01:59:15.774
You're gonna ride
him the whole eight.

01:59:18.151 --> 01:59:19.653
- I'm gonna give it my best.

01:59:20.988 --> 01:59:23.574
(hopeful music)

01:59:25.075 --> 01:59:27.494
- Welcome to roudn two
of the event of the year.

01:59:27.578 --> 01:59:29.621
Man versus bull.

01:59:29.705 --> 01:59:31.123
The world's greatest bull,

01:59:31.206 --> 01:59:33.709
versus, well, to be honest,

01:59:33.792 --> 01:59:36.253
the world's biggest underdog.

01:59:36.336 --> 01:59:39.256
Gangbanger versus Marcus Cruz.

01:59:39.339 --> 01:59:40.507
Hello again, everyone.

01:59:40.591 --> 01:59:42.050
I'm Justin McBride, and joined

01:59:42.134 --> 01:59:44.595
alongside former
champ, J.W. Hart.

01:59:44.678 --> 01:59:47.514
J.W., we were all
thrown for a curveball

01:59:47.598 --> 01:59:49.266
when Marcus Cruz
was a replacement

01:59:49.349 --> 01:59:51.393
for former world
champion, Tulsa Hughes,

01:59:51.476 --> 01:59:52.936
in tonight's event.

01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:55.689
- Yeah, I think we're all asking
the same question, Justin.

01:59:55.772 --> 01:59:57.232
Who is Marcus Cruz?

01:59:57.316 --> 01:59:59.109
- Yeah, not a name
that bull riding fans

01:59:59.192 --> 02:00:01.486
are gonna know, at
least until tonight.

02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:03.196
- Well, and nobody's
giving him a chance,

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.156
but I tell you what,

02:00:04.239 --> 02:00:06.074
bull riding is so unpredictable,

02:00:06.158 --> 02:00:09.620
and this matchup may be
even more unpredictable.

02:00:09.703 --> 02:00:12.664
- I think you would have to
go all the way back to 1990

02:00:12.748 --> 02:00:14.958
when Buster Douglas
defeated Mike Tyson

02:00:15.042 --> 02:00:17.544
to find a bigger underdog
than tonight's matchup.

02:00:17.628 --> 02:00:20.130
- You might even have to go
back to the Old Testament

02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:21.882
where David versus Goliath.

02:00:25.135 --> 02:00:28.055
- You know, I never
did like talking heads.

02:00:28.138 --> 02:00:28.847
- Yeah.

02:00:29.932 --> 02:00:31.016
Yeah, me either.

02:00:32.893 --> 02:00:35.520
But, I'm not expecting to
be the fan favorite tonight.

02:00:37.773 --> 02:00:39.942
The world's big on
paying your dues.

02:00:40.025 --> 02:00:41.735
And to most folks,

02:00:41.818 --> 02:00:43.111
I ain't paid all mine yet.

02:00:47.407 --> 02:00:48.158
- Hey.

02:00:52.454 --> 02:00:53.455
I got something for you.

02:00:57.334 --> 02:00:58.251
It's the pair I wore when I won

02:00:58.335 --> 02:00:59.711
my last world championship.

02:01:12.307 --> 02:01:15.727
Why don't you wear them tonight?

02:01:15.811 --> 02:01:17.521
Duncan had helped
me pick 'em out.

02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.942
- Thanks.

02:01:26.029 --> 02:01:27.322
I don't know what to say.

02:01:30.534 --> 02:01:32.452
- Don't say nothing,
just put 'em on.

02:01:37.582 --> 02:01:39.668
- This bull ain't
gonna wait all day.

02:01:39.751 --> 02:01:41.211
You coming?

02:01:41.294 --> 02:01:43.130
- Yeah, we're on our way.

02:01:45.382 --> 02:01:47.926
(door slams)

02:02:09.072 --> 02:02:11.867
(Marcus chuckles)

02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:14.453
You coming?

02:02:16.079 --> 02:02:17.497
- Not tonight.

02:02:17.581 --> 02:02:18.915
It's your time.

02:02:20.125 --> 02:02:21.835
- No, no, no, we got
this far together.

02:02:25.297 --> 02:02:26.590
- You don't need me.

02:02:30.385 --> 02:02:33.263
Besides, I'll be here
when you get back.

02:02:34.347 --> 02:02:36.141
Eight seconds ain't a long time.

02:02:37.392 --> 02:02:39.478
- Unless you're on a bull.

02:02:44.858 --> 02:02:49.446
You know, I promised myself
I'd never tell you this,

02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:53.658
but growing up,

02:02:53.742 --> 02:02:54.659
I looked up to you.

02:02:56.536 --> 02:02:57.579
I don't guess there's many

02:02:57.662 --> 02:02:59.790
black kids with a white
bull rider for a hero.

02:03:02.667 --> 02:03:03.460
And our lives, yeah,

02:03:04.961 --> 02:03:06.505
they fell apart
around the same time.

02:03:06.588 --> 02:03:10.550
So, I guess I think that's
why I understand you.

02:03:22.521 --> 02:03:24.606
I was gonna give this
to you later but...

02:03:36.576 --> 02:03:37.369
Go ahead.

02:03:46.628 --> 02:03:49.631
(melancholic music)

02:03:55.679 --> 02:03:57.305
I figured, you know,

02:03:59.599 --> 02:04:01.017
you might enjoy
reading it one day.

02:04:04.729 --> 02:04:06.314
- Yeah, maybe one day.

02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:12.445
- I even put some sticky notes

02:04:12.529 --> 02:04:14.239
on some of my favorite passages.

02:04:14.322 --> 02:04:15.866
Some I think you
might enjoy too.

02:04:18.827 --> 02:04:20.245
But the Son sets you free.

02:04:22.455 --> 02:04:23.540
You will be free indeed.

02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:32.591
I don't think I ever told you

02:04:32.674 --> 02:04:34.634
how it all started for me.

02:04:34.718 --> 02:04:35.468
The change.

02:04:37.637 --> 02:04:41.474
Well, one day I was
sitting in my cell,

02:04:41.558 --> 02:04:44.603
the guard pulls out
this big brass key,

02:04:44.686 --> 02:04:45.896
opens up my cell door.

02:04:47.397 --> 02:04:49.816
Asking me if he had a spare
he could leave with me.

02:04:52.611 --> 02:04:54.863
Never expected an answer.

02:04:54.946 --> 02:04:57.616
He said, yeah, I got one.

02:04:57.699 --> 02:04:58.825
Bring it back to you later.

02:04:59.993 --> 02:05:02.913
The next day, he shows
up with this box.

02:05:04.122 --> 02:05:05.457
Hands it to me.

02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:08.627
Says there's the key to
your freedom right there.

02:05:09.586 --> 02:05:11.296
Use it wisely.

02:05:11.379 --> 02:05:14.132
Turns and walks away.

02:05:17.719 --> 02:05:19.596
I was scared to
open it for hours.

02:05:20.764 --> 02:05:23.475
When I finally did,
it was a Bible.

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:29.773
I don't think I've ever
been more disappointed

02:05:29.856 --> 02:05:32.359
in my entire life. (laughs)

02:05:33.735 --> 02:05:34.527
But he was right.

02:05:36.279 --> 02:05:37.113
He was right.

02:05:39.241 --> 02:05:41.743
You see, the same
way he held the key

02:05:42.827 --> 02:05:43.995
that kept me locked up,

02:05:45.538 --> 02:05:47.123
that book holds the key

02:05:47.207 --> 02:05:48.833
to what keeps us all in bondage.

02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:52.587
That book taught me
about God's love for me,

02:05:52.671 --> 02:05:54.631
and his desire for me
to have a better life.

02:05:57.926 --> 02:06:02.847
I spent my whole life
being controlled by pride.

02:06:06.268 --> 02:06:08.561
Just doing what was best for me.

02:06:10.772 --> 02:06:13.191
And I finally learned that,

02:06:14.609 --> 02:06:15.819
I couldn't do it alone.

02:06:19.781 --> 02:06:20.907
I see that in you too.

02:06:25.704 --> 02:06:27.664
He changed me, Tulsa.

02:06:28.957 --> 02:06:31.751
Jesus unlocked my chains,

02:06:31.835 --> 02:06:34.713
and gave me life, real life.

02:06:41.219 --> 02:06:42.220
You can have it too.

02:06:43.805 --> 02:06:44.597
Freedom.

02:06:46.725 --> 02:06:48.601
And peace from those demons.

02:06:51.271 --> 02:06:54.232
- [Buck] They're about to
start this thing without you.

02:06:54.316 --> 02:06:55.066
- I'm coming.

02:07:14.753 --> 02:07:15.795
Hey.

02:07:18.506 --> 02:07:19.674
Thanks for believing in me.

02:07:33.521 --> 02:07:35.648
- J.W., this event
is being billed

02:07:35.732 --> 02:07:37.942
as bad versus bad.

02:07:38.026 --> 02:07:39.736
And having served
time in Louisiana's

02:07:39.819 --> 02:07:41.613
maximum security prison,

02:07:41.696 --> 02:07:43.156
a place where some
of the baddest men

02:07:43.239 --> 02:07:44.741
in the world are held,

02:07:44.824 --> 02:07:46.534
Marcus Cruz knows what it's like

02:07:46.618 --> 02:07:48.286
to be in tough situations.

02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:49.788
But let's get to the question

02:07:49.871 --> 02:07:51.664
that everybody wants to know.

02:07:51.748 --> 02:07:53.833
Does he have a chance today?

02:07:53.917 --> 02:07:54.959
- [J.W.] Chance?

02:07:55.043 --> 02:07:56.294
Doubtful.

02:07:56.378 --> 02:07:59.255
This matchup may be
more about survival

02:07:59.339 --> 02:08:00.715

around out there.

02:10:13.348 --> 02:10:14.974
- Yeah, I see him.

02:10:15.934 --> 02:10:17.185
- Got a lot of spunk.

02:10:19.062 --> 02:10:20.980
- You said the same
thing about me.

02:10:22.232 --> 02:10:23.441
- That, I did.

02:10:27.904 --> 02:10:30.490
- Well, J.W., the longest
ride on Gangbanger

02:10:30.573 --> 02:10:32.659
has been 6.2 seconds.

02:10:32.742 --> 02:10:35.328
Will today be the day
we get the full eight?

02:10:35.411 --> 02:10:36.788
- [J.W.] Well,
starting that clock

02:10:36.871 --> 02:10:38.957
a little bit early sure
wouldn't hurt a thing.

02:11:06.985 --> 02:11:07.944
- [Announcer] This
bull Gangbanger

02:11:08.027 --> 02:11:10.071
known for his short fuse.

02:11:14.784 --> 02:11:17.078
- Let him know you're coming.

02:11:18.955 --> 02:11:21.332
(tense music)

02:11:30.049 --> 02:11:31.426
- This ain't nothing personal.

02:11:36.639 --> 02:11:38.516
(dramatic music)

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.643
- [Justin] J.W.,
looks like Gangbanger

02:11:40.727 --> 02:11:41.894
is ready to get going.

02:11:41.978 --> 02:11:43.021
- Yeah, this one could be over

02:11:43.104 --> 02:11:44.564
before it ever gets started.

02:11:45.648 --> 02:11:47.442
- [Buck] Don't do that again.

02:11:48.651 --> 02:11:50.111
- Don't worry, I won't.

02:11:55.450 --> 02:11:57.827
- Alright, that first
jump gonna be a big one.

02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:00.622
Keep your head down
and stay over him.

02:12:01.914 --> 02:12:03.833
- Whose idea was this anyway?

02:12:04.917 --> 02:12:06.085
- Good question.

02:12:07.879 --> 02:12:10.465
(intense music)

02:12:29.609 --> 02:12:30.401
Ready?

02:12:31.569 --> 02:12:33.571
- Got any last
minute instructions?

02:12:33.655 --> 02:12:34.530
- Yeah.

02:12:34.614 --> 02:12:36.991
Just hold on.

02:12:37.075 --> 02:12:39.619
(intense music)

02:12:44.499 --> 02:12:46.084
- [Justin] What a first jump!

02:12:46.959 --> 02:12:50.004
(inspiring music)

02:12:51.005 --> 02:12:52.256
- Ride him!

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:53.091
Bear down!

02:12:54.175 --> 02:12:56.969
(inspiring music)

02:13:04.644 --> 02:13:06.145
- Hold on, Daddy!

02:13:20.576 --> 02:13:21.953
(buzzer rings)

02:13:22.036 --> 02:13:23.204
- [Justin] He did it!

02:13:23.287 --> 02:13:24.539
He did it!

02:13:24.622 --> 02:13:27.417
J.W., can you believe
what we just watched?

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:28.960
- [J.W.] That's absolutely
one of the best rides

02:13:29.043 --> 02:13:30.002
I've ever seen.

02:13:30.086 --> 02:13:31.045
- Yeah!

02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:31.838
Yeah!

02:13:31.921 --> 02:13:36.384
He did it. (laughs)

02:13:40.054 --> 02:13:41.139
- [Justin] Ladies and gentlemen,

02:13:41.222 --> 02:13:43.975
David has just slain Goliath.

02:13:44.058 --> 02:13:46.936
Marcus Cruz has
done the impossible!

02:13:47.019 --> 02:13:48.146
- Oh!

02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:50.106
Thank you, Lord.

02:13:50.189 --> 02:13:52.066
Yeah, that's a ride!

02:13:59.115 --> 02:14:02.201
- [Announcer] This
bull is not done yet.

02:14:10.084 --> 02:14:11.210
- Marry me.

02:14:15.465 --> 02:14:17.341
(Vee sobs)

02:14:17.425 --> 02:14:18.801
- Only if you promise
to never make me

02:14:18.885 --> 02:14:20.720
watch you ride bulls again.

02:14:23.347 --> 02:14:24.140
- Yeah.

02:14:31.063 --> 02:14:32.190
- You did it.

02:14:33.232 --> 02:14:34.150
Marcus, you did it.

02:14:34.233 --> 02:14:35.943
Marcus, you did it.

02:14:36.861 --> 02:14:39.197
(Vee sobs)

02:14:43.618 --> 02:14:44.410
- Tulsa?

02:14:52.126 --> 02:14:53.503
- I can't do this.

02:14:58.257 --> 02:15:00.718
I can't do this anymore.

02:15:00.802 --> 02:15:01.636
- I'm here.

02:15:03.930 --> 02:15:07.016
(somber piano music)

02:15:26.577 --> 02:15:29.205
- We are gonna be late.

02:15:29.288 --> 02:15:30.289
Woo.

02:15:32.667 --> 02:15:33.501
Come on.

02:15:33.584 --> 02:15:34.627
- Wait, our hat!

02:15:34.710 --> 02:15:35.962
- Oh, yeah, good thinking,

02:15:36.045 --> 02:15:37.171
we're gonna need those.

02:15:39.006 --> 02:15:40.174
That's for you, sir.

02:15:45.179 --> 02:15:45.930
Aw, we look good.

02:15:46.013 --> 02:15:46.889
We're ready, come on.

02:15:58.359 --> 02:15:59.235
- It's me who's
supposed to be late

02:15:59.318 --> 02:16:00.444
to my wedding, not you.

02:16:01.571 --> 02:16:02.822
Go ahead, give it to me.

02:16:03.698 --> 02:16:04.991
- Give you what?

02:16:05.074 --> 02:16:05.783
- The ring.

02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:13.457
- I got it.

02:16:16.752 --> 02:16:19.380
- You talking about this ring?

02:16:21.382 --> 02:16:23.634
- You see, I gave it to
Daniel for safe keeping.

02:16:25.219 --> 02:16:26.262
- Good idea.

02:16:28.014 --> 02:16:30.224
- Speaking of which, have
I introduced you to Daniel?

02:16:30.308 --> 02:16:31.601
- We haven't met yet.

02:16:31.684 --> 02:16:32.684
Heard a lot of good
things about you,

02:16:32.768 --> 02:16:33.519
good to meet you.

02:16:35.271 --> 02:16:37.690
So you decided to give
this mentoring thing

02:16:37.772 --> 02:16:38.941
another try, huh?

02:16:39.025 --> 02:16:40.651
- Yeah, absolutely.

02:16:40.735 --> 02:16:43.529
But this time, it's
not court ordered.

02:16:43.612 --> 02:16:45.197
(laughs)

02:16:45.281 --> 02:16:46.616
- Well, if you don't mind,

02:16:46.699 --> 02:16:49.326
I got some people waiting on me.

02:16:49.410 --> 02:16:51.245
- It's always about
you, isn't it?

02:16:52.288 --> 02:16:53.205
- Some things never change.

02:16:53.289 --> 02:16:55.958
- I got an image to maintain.

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:56.959
- We have to take our place.

02:16:57.043 --> 02:16:58.628
- Okay, come on.

02:16:58.710 --> 02:16:59.545
- Hey, Daniel.

02:16:59.629 --> 02:17:00.838
- Hey, Ms. Ann.

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:05.675
(violin wedding music)

02:17:11.724 --> 02:17:12.475
- Hey, buddy.

02:17:12.558 --> 02:17:13.768
Do me a favor.

02:17:13.851 --> 02:17:17.228
Why don't you just park
it right there for me.

02:17:18.481 --> 02:17:20.398
Ah, he's a cute kid.

02:17:22.026 --> 02:17:25.029
- I never thought you'd
want to be a mentor.

02:17:25.111 --> 02:17:27.239
- Yeah, me neither.

02:17:27.323 --> 02:17:30.618
But you know, I'm getting there.

02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:32.452
You know what?

02:17:32.536 --> 02:17:34.538
I'm gonna do it right this time.

02:17:34.621 --> 02:17:35.706
- I can tell.

02:17:38.334 --> 02:17:40.419
- This may be a
crazy time to do it,

02:17:40.503 --> 02:17:42.004
but I want to thank you.

02:17:43.464 --> 02:17:45.091
- You're welcome, Tulsa.

02:17:46.092 --> 02:17:47.093
- No, seriously.

02:17:49.637 --> 02:17:50.429
Thank you.

02:17:51.347 --> 02:17:52.431
- You're welcome.

02:17:58.312 --> 02:18:01.232
- You know, we could make
this a double wedding.

02:18:01.315 --> 02:18:02.566
- One step at a time, cowboy.

02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:04.026
- Oh, come on, now.

02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:05.736
You sound like my counselor
Pastor John.

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:07.905
- Good.

02:18:07.989 --> 02:18:09.573
Then the last six months
weren't a waste of time.

02:18:10.866 --> 02:18:12.660
- Well, that offer still stands.

02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:22.585
(lighthearted acoustic music)

02:18:26.257 --> 02:18:28.425
Well, I'll see you in a few.

02:18:29.343 --> 02:18:31.887
- I'll be waiting right here.

02:18:36.350 --> 02:18:37.393
- All rise.

02:18:38.727 --> 02:18:42.522
(lighthearted acoustic music)

02:18:54.618 --> 02:18:57.580
Who gives this
woman to be married?

02:18:57.663 --> 02:18:58.414
- I do.

02:19:12.136 --> 02:19:17.141
- When I was a child,
I talked like a child.

02:19:18.976 --> 02:19:23.981
I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.

02:19:25.357 --> 02:19:27.192
Then I became a man.

02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:31.112
Left the ways of
childhood behind me.

02:19:32.531 --> 02:19:35.159
I promise to love, to protect,

02:19:37.036 --> 02:19:40.539
and to trust, and
provide for you, my wife.

02:19:45.795 --> 02:19:47.379
And for you, my son.

02:19:53.761 --> 02:19:58.766
On this day forward, through
whatever life may bring us,

02:20:01.602 --> 02:20:04.188
these things, I promise forever.

02:20:07.608 --> 02:20:09.568
- By the power invested in me,

02:20:11.362 --> 02:20:13.239
I now pronounce you,
husband and wife.

02:20:15.825 --> 02:20:17.618
Marcus, you may kiss your bride.

02:20:18.869 --> 02:20:22.832
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Marcus Cruz.

02:20:22.915 --> 02:20:25.584
(attendees clap)

02:20:31.423 --> 02:20:33.050
- I would like to give a toast.

02:20:35.427 --> 02:20:37.429
Since my recovery is
successfully entering

02:20:37.513 --> 02:20:38.597
its sixth month,

02:20:40.182 --> 02:20:42.685
my glass is filled
with delicious,

02:20:42.768 --> 02:20:45.521
wonderful tasting,
sparkling cider.

02:20:45.604 --> 02:20:46.814
(laughing)

02:20:46.897 --> 02:20:47.690
Seriously, though.

02:20:48.566 --> 02:20:50.568
You're the luckiest man I know.

02:20:50.651 --> 02:20:51.944
- [Buck] Here, here.

02:20:52.027 --> 02:20:53.863
- Wait, hold on a second.

02:20:53.946 --> 02:20:58.534
Now, true that this is
a lucky day for Marcus,

02:20:58.617 --> 02:21:02.496
but I went back, I
watched that tape.

02:21:03.747 --> 02:21:05.708
This toast here
is to the luckiest

02:21:05.791 --> 02:21:07.835
bull rider in the world.

02:21:07.918 --> 02:21:09.461
(laughing)

02:21:09.545 --> 02:21:10.504
- Wait, wait.

02:21:10.588 --> 02:21:12.381
You take into account
who I had for a trainer,

02:21:13.215 --> 02:21:14.758
I say luck was my only shot.

02:21:14.842 --> 02:21:16.135
(laughing)

02:21:16.218 --> 02:21:17.136
- Then it's agreed.

02:21:18.971 --> 02:21:22.558
Marcus and Velena,
may your marriage

02:21:22.641 --> 02:21:24.685
last a lot longer than
my bull riding career.

02:21:24.768 --> 02:21:25.519
- Here, here!

02:21:28.063 --> 02:21:29.190
(glass clangs)

02:21:29.273 --> 02:21:30.900
And for the record,

02:21:30.983 --> 02:21:33.944
that ride was more
than just dumb luck.

02:21:34.028 --> 02:21:37.489
And I know a jealous bull
rider when I see one.

02:21:37.573 --> 02:21:38.532
- Please, now.

02:21:38.616 --> 02:21:39.533
Come on, I'd of
ridden that thing

02:21:39.617 --> 02:21:41.535
with my left hand, eyes closed.

02:21:41.619 --> 02:21:43.370
(laughing)

02:21:43.454 --> 02:21:44.622
- Congratulations, Marcus

02:21:44.705 --> 02:21:45.915
- Thank you.

02:21:45.998 --> 02:21:47.917
- It looks like you've
found yourself a keeper.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.168
So you're the young lady

02:21:49.251 --> 02:21:51.003
that cashed my
million dollar check.

02:21:52.421 --> 02:21:53.797
Well, don't you worry
now, little darling.

02:21:53.881 --> 02:21:55.674
There's more where
that came from.

02:21:57.593 --> 02:21:58.719
How you doing, cowboy?

02:21:59.887 --> 02:22:01.263
- I'm good.

02:22:01.347 --> 02:22:02.139
Day by day.

02:22:03.224 --> 02:22:05.184
But I think I've
finally figured it out.

02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:07.311
- Well.

02:22:07.394 --> 02:22:08.938
Can we tell him now?

02:22:09.021 --> 02:22:10.272
- Now's as good as any.

02:22:11.732 --> 02:22:13.484
- Bill's got a new bull.

02:22:13.567 --> 02:22:14.526
Rankest thing you've ever seen.

02:22:14.610 --> 02:22:15.319
- Oh, okay.

02:22:15.402 --> 02:22:16.487
- Hold, hold, hold on.

02:22:16.570 --> 02:22:18.364
Before you even get started,

02:22:18.447 --> 02:22:21.242
my bull riding career is over.

02:22:21.325 --> 02:22:23.285
- Well actually, I
was talking to Tulsa.

02:22:24.745 --> 02:22:25.996
He's 20-0 on the circuit,

02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:27.539
the longest ride
was three seconds.

02:22:29.708 --> 02:22:32.336
- [Bill] Well, are you healthy?

02:22:32.419 --> 02:22:34.838
(catchy music)

02:22:39.677 --> 02:22:40.719
- Ready for this, old man?

02:22:41.804 --> 02:22:42.721
- You know it, kid.

02:22:45.474 --> 02:22:46.308
- He's going left.

02:22:47.643 --> 02:22:48.727
- He always goes right.

02:22:50.062 --> 02:22:51.272
- Not tonight.

02:22:52.564 --> 02:22:55.609
- You just want to see me
bust my butt, don't you?

02:22:55.693 --> 02:22:56.568
- Won't be the first time

02:22:56.652 --> 02:22:58.279
you made the highlight reel.

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:00.447
- You just make sure
they spell my name right

02:23:00.531 --> 02:23:01.740
on that million dollar check.

02:23:05.577 --> 02:23:06.620
- [Marcus] I bet you
a round of drinks

02:23:06.704 --> 02:23:09.832
you don't make it four seconds.

02:23:09.915 --> 02:23:11.709
- You know I don't
drink no more.

02:23:13.544 --> 02:23:14.461
- Just making sure.

02:23:17.631 --> 02:23:18.674
- Watch this.

02:23:19.466 --> 02:23:21.969
