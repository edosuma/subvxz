00:06.339 --> 00:07.382
[Kris] This is today.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.926
Your current approval rating
is 91 percent,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.219
higher than Michelle Obama,

00:11.302 --> 00:13.972
Oprah, golden retriever puppies,
and orgasms.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.224
Who are these insane nine percent
of people

00:16.307 --> 00:17.767
who don't like those things?

00:17.851 --> 00:20.061
Some people just like
to watch the world burn.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.814
I mean, Lyndon LaRouche got votes
in the '92 presidential campaign,

00:22.897 --> 00:24.190
and he was running from jail.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.193
All I know is that JFK had to get shot
to pull these numbers.

00:27.277 --> 00:31.322
My mother said that she had an affair
with JFK at the Mayflower Hotel,

00:31.406 --> 00:32.949
but she was a habitual liar.

00:33.658 --> 00:37.287
My son has wanted to be in politics
since he was a child.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.204
I know.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.956
I actually worked for his competition

00:40.040 --> 00:42.375
on the Saint Sebastian
student body president campaign.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.461
He's the one who recommended me to you
for this job.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.463
Oh, yes. Forgive me, sweetheart.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.798
I have a thing
where I forget young people.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.924
It's a tic I have.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.762
I never understood the draw of politics.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.096
It's so transactional.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.683
So much work to get support
from people whom you don't even respect.

00:59.684 --> 01:00.894
But I understand it now.

01:02.145 --> 01:06.357
There are jobs that feed the ego,
and there are jobs that make a difference.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.443
Politics does both.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.446
It's vanity without the bitter aftertaste.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.573
I would strike while the iron's hot

01:13.656 --> 01:17.535
and come up with some normally
impossible-to-accomplish policy proposals.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.329
Voters would follow you into battle

01:19.412 --> 01:21.664
or even give up chocolate for you
at this point.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.124
But that doesn't sound fun.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.834
How about...

01:25.418 --> 01:28.588
we bury all of the power lines
to prevent wildfires?

01:28.671 --> 01:29.964
-[exhales]
-No.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.925
-Okay, no. Something more bold.
-Yeah.

01:32.008 --> 01:32.926
Um...

01:33.009 --> 01:36.137
How about we ban plastic
from the state of California?

01:36.221 --> 01:38.389
Checkpoints at every border crossing.

01:38.473 --> 01:43.061
The Great Pacific Plastic Garbage Patch
is over 80,000 tons and growing.

01:43.144 --> 01:46.481
I refuse to let the future
independent nation of California

01:46.564 --> 01:48.233
-contribute even one ounce.
-[man] Mmm.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.276
-Ah, ma'am, your ice bath is ready.
-Oh!

01:50.360 --> 01:51.277
Excellent.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.779
I will not be satisfied

01:52.862 --> 01:55.323
until that approval rating reaches
100 percent.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.784
I can't see what could get in your way,
ma'am.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.912
[Kris clears throat]

02:00.995 --> 02:02.997
[machines beeping steadily]

02:13.007 --> 02:15.718
[gasps] Mrs. McCutcheon, you're awake.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.303
How long have I been here?

02:17.387 --> 02:19.722
You've been in a coma
for almost three years.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.432
We need to call the doctors.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.101
No, you need to call the press.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.061
But first, I'm gonna need hair and makeup.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.729
Do you want us to contact your husband?

02:26.813 --> 02:28.106
No. No.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.985
That dickwad can hear what I have to say
with the rest of the world.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.331
[whispers] Anyone see you?

04:08.414 --> 04:10.250
Not yet.
If you don't open the door, they will.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.209
Okay.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.672
I have something. It's good.
I don't know how good,

04:15.755 --> 04:17.257
-but good.
-[exhales] Okay.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.302
-All right. Lay it on me.
-"Lay it on me"? Who are you?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.428
Just, what is it?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.180
[sighs] Okay, so Dede's ahead, right?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.391
So, there's basically nothing
for me to do over there.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.309
I mean, there's nothing for anyone to do.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.811
And you know I'm a woman, right?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.437
-Yes.
-Like, you know

04:31.521 --> 04:33.564
I have a woman's intuition,
how that's an actual thing?

04:34.315 --> 04:36.359
Okay, so there's something up
with Hadassah.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.944
At first, I was like, no, she's happy

04:38.027 --> 04:39.821
because she's going to win,
but then I realized

04:39.904 --> 04:41.155
no, she's different.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.198
[door shuts]

04:42.282 --> 04:43.533
Frappuccino, Sherry.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.413
-I'll take that if you don't want it.
-No! She put something in it.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.956
[McAfee] She used to just bark at me.

04:50.039 --> 04:50.873
[Hadassah] Hey!

04:50.957 --> 04:53.126
[McAfee] And then suddenly,
she seemed to almost like me.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.379
McAfee, come in here.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.842
Do you know anything about spicy lube?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.719
[sputters] I'm sorry, what?

05:02.802 --> 05:05.388
You know, like for... intercourse?

05:05.471 --> 05:06.597
Do you mean warming lube?

05:06.681 --> 05:08.975
Because I'm pretty sure spicy
wouldn't feel good down there.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.226
Yeah! Yeah, that's it.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.395
Where it's tingly for him and her.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.813
-Have you ever tried it?
-No.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.231
But I've seen it at the store.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.776
Oh, great. I need you to go get me some.
But don't bring it back here, okay?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.903
Bring it to my place
and leave it with the doorman.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.531
No, don't. Don't, don't, don't.
He'll look inside. Tell you what...

05:26.284 --> 05:28.661
just leave it in the nightstand,
next to my bed.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.413
Right side, top drawer. Got it?

05:30.496 --> 05:32.457
-Sure.
-And don't tell anyone

05:32.540 --> 05:33.958
you got me spicy lube, got it?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.293
-Got it.
-Okay.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.377
Good. Go!

05:37.754 --> 05:39.088
We're gonna call this...

05:39.172 --> 05:40.465
"Operation...

05:40.798 --> 05:42.592
Spicy Lube."

05:45.386 --> 05:47.221
-Hello?
-[McAfee] So, she's obviously

05:47.305 --> 05:48.556
having sex with someone, right?

05:48.639 --> 05:50.266
And I'm dying to find out who it is.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.310
Not even for the campaign,
just for, like, myself.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.478
I was fascinated.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.605
So she's got this closet, right?

05:55.688 --> 05:56.814
So many shoes.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.232
Like, so many.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.568
It's like she went to Bergdorf's
and bought out the place.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.861
No way she's worn half of them.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.780
-I don't care about the shoes.
-Fine.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.074
Then I saw that half of her closet
is formal wear,

06:06.157 --> 06:08.284
stuff that she's probably touched
once a month.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.286
And I knew
she didn't have an event that night.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.454
You didn't.

06:12.080 --> 06:12.914
I did.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.085
[Hadassah] All right.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.337
What have we got here?
Let's see, let's see.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.380
Okay.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.549
Oh, it's your lucky night, baby girl.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.093
[McAfee] So she got back around 9:00,

06:25.176 --> 06:27.345
and she picked out
this sexy little number.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.930
She talked to herself the whole time,

06:29.013 --> 06:31.349
and then at around 9:30, he shows up.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.517
Who?

06:32.809 --> 06:33.643
William.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.937
[Payton] Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.355
Threesome William?

06:37.438 --> 06:40.400
-[muted moaning]
-The spicy lube, both of them loved it.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.943
Like, really loved it.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.362
Like, it seemed so effective
that I might consider trying it.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.405
In fact, I'm going to.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.948
Stop talking about the lube. Hold up.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.616
You just, what? You stayed all night?

06:48.699 --> 06:49.784
Just until they fell asleep.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.078
They're both crazy snorers,
so I knew they wouldn't hear.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.287
-Good night.
-Doorman saw me,

06:53.371 --> 06:55.581
but he didn't think anything of it.
It was, like, 10:30.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.291
I called you, then I came straight here.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.252
I mean, I don't know
if this wins us the race,

06:59.335 --> 07:01.629
but if we leak
the whole throuple thing is a sham,

07:01.712 --> 07:02.839
I mean, that's so weird.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.799
That's, like, a crazy lie for her to tell.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.176
And like it or not,
voters don't tolerate a woman

07:07.260 --> 07:08.428
whom they perceive as a liar.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.762
They'll accept it from a man,

07:09.846 --> 07:12.181
but I think it makes Dede look underhanded
and craven.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.143
It destroys her whole
"older women are sexy" thing.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.311
I mean, she's gonna have to explain
what's going on.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.230
I think she loses ten points

07:19.313 --> 07:21.482
and still wins, but by 15 instead of 25.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.526
And suddenly,
you're set up for the next campaign.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.444
No, this is big.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.113
This could push her out of the race.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.698
This is exactly what we needed!

07:29.490 --> 07:30.700
This is our Hail Mary.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.243
Okay.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.412
I'm getting dressed.
I know what the next move is.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.539
[knocking] You have a second?

07:37.915 --> 07:38.833
[whispers] Get in here.

07:40.751 --> 07:41.627
You...

07:42.503 --> 07:45.131
-have got to try it.
-What?

07:45.214 --> 07:46.674
The spicy lube. It's...

07:47.008 --> 07:51.304
oh, boy! Spicy.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.638
Yeah, I just wanted to tell you

07:52.722 --> 07:54.432
I was at the front desk,
and some guy called,

07:54.515 --> 07:57.018
William, I think he said.
Um, he said he was trying to reach you,

07:57.101 --> 07:58.227
-but his phone was dying.
-Oh!

07:58.311 --> 08:00.438
Said it was urgent.
Something about a proposal?

08:00.521 --> 08:01.355
What?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.983
-A proposal?
-Yeah. I don't know what it would be.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.944
Um, maybe he's an outside contractor
for the campaign.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.279
Anyway, he's at Balthazar.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.363
Okay, I'll be back.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.492
[door slams shut]

08:15.369 --> 08:16.913
[panting]

08:18.164 --> 08:19.040
[Payton] Hadassah!

08:21.292 --> 08:22.126
Hi!

08:27.798 --> 08:29.842
-What are you doing here?
-Just sit. I'll explain.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.512
So, here's what's going on.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.013
You and Dede are lying.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.264
There is no throuple

08:35.348 --> 08:38.267
because you're in a relationship
with William, who clearly is not here now.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.062
[gasps] You son of a bitch.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.355
So, we have some options.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.814
I could go to The New York Times.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.360
It's splashed across the front pages
the last few days of the election.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.736
Dede wins, but not by much.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.071
She loses the VP slot,

08:50.154 --> 08:51.697
and I live to see another campaign.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.241
-Oh, you slimy little--
-Mm-hmm.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.285
Or you could get her to pull out.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.788
Right? She can't be all that jazzed
about yet another two years

08:58.871 --> 09:00.289
as "majority leader," you know?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.666
And she keeps her VP hopes alive.

09:01.749 --> 09:02.792
You arrogant little prick.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.503
Just hang on one second.
There's also you personally.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.838
I really think it's you
that's in the most danger.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.799
Dede Standish's sloppy seconds?

09:09.882 --> 09:11.801
Not a good look.
And whatever she does decide to do,

09:11.884 --> 09:13.636
it's not like she can take you
along with her.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.263
Your career will be... over.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.807
You hateful, double-dealing little futz.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.308
Yep, yep, yep. Just one more thing.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.103
So it's Friday now.
Uh, the election is Tuesday.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.481
So you have 12 hours,
and then I will go to the press.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.609
[sighs, clears throat]

09:29.402 --> 09:30.403
Oh, you can go now.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.572
[chuckles]

09:33.531 --> 09:35.157
-You know what?
-[Payton] Mmm?

09:35.741 --> 09:39.078
Four days left. Dede is so far ahead,

09:39.161 --> 09:41.914
she drops out today, she still wins.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.001
Candidates who die before election day
have been known to win.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.544
Yeah, but think about it.

09:46.627 --> 09:50.423
You know, your voters, no offense,
they skew a little bit older, right?

09:51.173 --> 09:53.342
And she made such a thing
of this throuple,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.845
this sexual,
powerful woman of a certain age.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.930
I'm sure it caused
many a conversation over dinner,

09:58.014 --> 10:01.601
probably even caused some people
to express very strong opinions about it

10:01.684 --> 10:03.436
to their spouses, to their friends.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.106
So for that to now be exposed as a lie,

10:07.189 --> 10:10.776
as a weird political ploy...

10:11.444 --> 10:12.361
[whistles]

10:12.737 --> 10:15.323
...I think a lot of her voters stay home
on Tuesday.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.533
-[whispers] Wouldn't you say?
-[chuckles]

10:17.825 --> 10:19.201
You're good.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.162
I give you that.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.247
-You're going places.
-[Payton laughs]

10:23.664 --> 10:25.916
-I even admire you a little bit.
-[whispers] Now get out.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.544
But you forgot one thing.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.713
What is that?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.132
I'm not telling you.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.551
Run your story.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.678
I don't give a shit.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.144
[Payton sighs]
Thank you for suggesting we take a walk.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.021
Nothing works better to clear the mind.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.650
I think it was, um, Henry David Thoreau
who said--

10:50.733 --> 10:52.443
-I'm pregnant.
-[Payton laughs]

10:52.526 --> 10:54.153
Okay, no. I don't think he ever said that.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.613
Not Thoreau. Me.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.115
Your child grows in my womb.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.289
Okay. Okay, okay.
The suddenness of this news

11:05.373 --> 11:07.500
has made me numb to any feelings about it,
good or bad.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.503
So, while my emotions recover,

11:10.586 --> 11:12.880
let's just discuss
how exactly this happened.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.091
I mean, we always use condoms.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.342
Not always.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.970
As you know, I meditate every morning
before getting out of bed.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.014
It calms and energizes me for the day,

11:22.098 --> 11:24.767
but it also creates a oneness
with my reproductive system

11:24.850 --> 11:26.727
that allows me to know
the days when I'm fertile.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.272
The days when I'm sure it's safe
are the days when I allow you to enter me

11:30.356 --> 11:31.357
without protection.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.192
Usually.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.861
This month, I may have been...

11:35.945 --> 11:38.280
less cautious than usual.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.532
Why?

11:39.865 --> 11:40.825
I don't know.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.454
[voice trembling]
I think it's possible that I've...

11:46.706 --> 11:50.751
subconsciously been feeling
jealous of Astrid.

11:50.835 --> 11:56.340
Perhaps on that day,
I was feeling particularly needy

11:56.424 --> 11:58.926
to have something
that she's never had with you...

11:59.385 --> 12:02.179
the closeness of unprotected sex.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.973
I know I made you withdraw,

12:04.056 --> 12:05.641
but apparently, you were a little late.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.769
But it's all right. [chuckles]
I've thought it all through.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.896
-What do you mean?
-First of all,

12:10.980 --> 12:12.857
abortion is a political liability.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.400
Not in true blue New York,

12:14.483 --> 12:16.986
but in a national campaign,
it's dangerous.

12:17.069 --> 12:17.945
[Payton] Mmm.

12:18.028 --> 12:21.407
What always works, however,
locally and nationally,

12:21.490 --> 12:25.619
is the joy of a young, attractive family.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.164
-JFK, the Obamas.
-Mmm.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.331
We should tell no one,

12:29.415 --> 12:30.624
not even our team.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.419
Then the night before the election,
we should announce the pregnancy

12:33.502 --> 12:35.713
and our engagement,

12:35.921 --> 12:37.256
simultaneously.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.552
Contrast our youth and fertility
with Dede's menopausal campaign.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.262
[sighs]

12:43.554 --> 12:44.472
You're right.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.807
You're right. This is good.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.645
Wait, we-- we haven't even discussed
how we feel about it.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.529
[Alice sniffles]

13:01.113 --> 13:02.364
[whispers] This is great.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.367
I'm really happy.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.870
Me too. [laughs]

13:09.872 --> 13:11.499
I'll need to go shopping to buy
new clothes

13:11.582 --> 13:13.584
-to accentuate my baby bump.
-[both laugh]

13:13.667 --> 13:17.129
And I'm setting a meeting to break it off
with Astrid.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.257
Engaged, pregnant couples don't have
threesomes unless they work in music.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.218
-[Payton] Mmm.
-[Alice] Mmm.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.971
-Wow.
-[both chuckling]

13:26.055 --> 13:28.390
-Names. What do you think?
-[Alice clears throat] Well...

13:28.474 --> 13:30.559
-I was thinking John or Payton Junior...
-Well...

13:30.643 --> 13:32.394
-Payton Junior. Mmm.
-...for a boy.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.772
[Dede]
Oh, my God! Oh, that's unbelievable.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.399
-I feel like I'm 25 again. [gasping]
-[Marcus] I-- I--

13:37.483 --> 13:39.985
-[laughing]
-I-- I-- Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi. [laughs]

13:40.069 --> 13:41.987
-I can't believe it. [sighs]
-Oh...

13:42.071 --> 13:44.281
Suddenly, this marriage makes sense again.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.409
-[both] Mmm...
-I love you, Dede.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.037
-Happy to be of service.
-[Dede and Marcus] Oh!

13:50.120 --> 13:52.873
-Happy to be served.
-[all laughing]

13:54.083 --> 13:57.002
This-- This is... unbelievable.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.671
I don't miss William at all.

13:59.255 --> 14:04.051
I get to be the filling
in the ice cream sandwich again.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.762
-[Marcus chortling]
-[Dede moaning]

14:07.221 --> 14:09.932
Who wants a drink?

14:10.015 --> 14:11.475
-I do.
-Okay.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.394
-Yes? Okay.
-Me too.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.563
You are fine.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.814
[men chuckling]

14:16.897 --> 14:20.734
But are you fine signing the NDA, right?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.862
-'Cause this...
-He...

14:22.945 --> 14:24.446
-...cannot get out.
-Yeah.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.449
-Absolutely.
-Oh. Ahh...

14:28.033 --> 14:28.993
[Dede] Ahh...

14:29.493 --> 14:31.871
I can't believe this.

14:32.162 --> 14:36.125
I-- It was just so organic.

14:36.208 --> 14:40.379
And you were making eyes at us
across the restaurant.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.674
Well, I knew from the news
that you two were a little kinky, so...

14:43.757 --> 14:45.342
-[Dede] Oh...
-...I just came over.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.177
[Dede sighs]

14:47.261 --> 14:48.178
[Marcus] You know,

14:49.096 --> 14:50.347
this needs to be a thing,

14:50.431 --> 14:53.517
-but not just a one-time thing.
-[man] Mmm.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.352
-Here, here.
-Yeah.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.147
You're not going anywhere.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.607
-[Marcus] Mmm...
-[Dede sighs]

14:59.690 --> 15:01.108
-[phone vibrating]
-[Dede] Oh!

15:01.442 --> 15:03.903
-God! Here. Hold that, sweetheart.
-Yeah, sure. Got it.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.195
[Dede groans]

15:06.572 --> 15:07.531
Oh.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.449
Yeah?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.993
Wait, just s-- slow down.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.912
I can't understand you.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.081
[exhales sharply]
Oh-- Okay, we'll-- we'll be right there.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.084
It's Hadassah. She's freaking out.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.794
-About what?
-[Dede] I don't know.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.088
-We'll find out.
-Here.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.674
In a while.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.345
[Dede] I can't believe it!
So he knows everything.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.262
It's all my fault.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.348
I should've picked up the spicy lube
on my way home.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.058
I'm across the street from a Duane Reade!

15:34.141 --> 15:35.976
No, I blame the both of you.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.061
The three of us were fine.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.395
We were together, happy,

15:38.479 --> 15:40.272
and on our way to the fucking White House!

15:40.356 --> 15:43.108
I'll resign. I'll hold a press conference,
admit I had an affair,

15:43.192 --> 15:45.611
say you knew nothing about it.
Dede can play the victim,

15:45.694 --> 15:48.572
I'll be the bad guy. [sobs]
And my career will be over.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.032
[William spluttering] No! Hold on.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.160
Listen, these past couple of weeks,
they've been a real emotional whirlwind.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.705
Am I expected to... what? Just--
Just be a part of the throuple again, or…?

15:58.415 --> 16:01.710
-Uh, well, I don't quite know...
-[Marcus chuckles]

16:01.794 --> 16:03.796
-...how to put this...
-We found someone else.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.674
-What?!
-Jesus Christ, are you serious?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.425
How could you do that to me?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.636
Oh, so now we're the bad guys.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.054
You dumped us, William!

16:12.471 --> 16:14.640
-This is sick! We're all sick!
-[Dede] No--

16:14.723 --> 16:16.892
I used to be a nice Jewish girl
from Paramus.

16:16.976 --> 16:17.977
Now I'm part of this?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.979
This isn't even a love triangle.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.855
It's like a-- a sex pentagram!

16:21.939 --> 16:25.067
Okay, everybody, calm down!

16:25.943 --> 16:30.030
First of all, it's not gross to be over 50

16:30.114 --> 16:32.116
-and still have sexual urges.
-[Marcus] Mmm.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.868
You keep saying that
like we were 51 or something.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.162
We're way over 50, Dede.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.832
-Maybe it is gross.
-[Dede] Just stop it. I'm still the boss.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.208
I don't want you to resign.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.209
I don't accept that.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.128
What else can we do, Dede? Come on.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.006
Someone's gotta fall on a sword here
to win this race

16:47.089 --> 16:48.340
and get Tino to say yes.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.759
-I-- I understand, um...
-[phone chirps]

16:50.843 --> 16:54.805
...but I-- I'm not gonna
decide on that tonight.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.473
I wanna sleep on it.

16:56.724 --> 16:57.599
[Marcus] Mmm.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.893
-[reporters chattering on video]
-What? What is it?

17:00.310 --> 17:02.688
-[reporter shouts] Mary!
-[overlapping clamor on video]

17:02.771 --> 17:04.273
-Mary!
-Mary! Mary!

17:04.356 --> 17:05.899
Mary McCutcheon woke up.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.901
[Mary] Thank you for coming.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.864
My name is Mary Moskowitz McCutcheon,

17:12.281 --> 17:15.159
wife of Senator Tino McCutcheon.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.869
And as I'm sure you all know,

17:17.202 --> 17:19.621
I have spent the last several years
in a coma,

17:19.705 --> 17:23.792
following the side effects
of a severe case of trichinosis.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.628
And... let me just take a moment to say

17:26.712 --> 17:28.422
to all the children of the world,

17:28.505 --> 17:33.052
never accept a pulled pork taco
from someone you don't know.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.764
Now, as you can see, I am now recovered.

17:36.847 --> 17:41.602
And based on the things
that I heard Tino say to me and to others,

17:41.685 --> 17:44.772
-I am filing for divorce.
-[low murmurs]

17:44.855 --> 17:47.941
From the very first days
of my incapacitation,

17:48.442 --> 17:51.904
Tino McCutcheon repeatedly asked
the hospital staff

17:51.987 --> 17:54.573
if, were they to pull the plug,

17:55.699 --> 17:58.243
exactly which plug would it be?

17:58.327 --> 17:59.286
[low gasps]

17:59.369 --> 18:00.996
And then, as it became clear

18:01.080 --> 18:04.958
that my hospitalization would be long
and the outcome uncertain,

18:05.042 --> 18:09.671
my husband took to whispering things
in my ear, like...

18:09.755 --> 18:11.924
Really go to sleep, sweetheart.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.468
This is costing an arm and a leg,
you know.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.720
[whispers] Walk into the light, Mary.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.638
Come on.

18:17.721 --> 18:21.225
After his successful Senate campaign,

18:21.308 --> 18:22.935
Tino took to telling me...

18:23.018 --> 18:25.604
I mean Senate, it's boring as shit,

18:25.687 --> 18:27.898
but two years from now,
I'm running for president,

18:27.981 --> 18:30.275
so, if you wouldn't mind...

18:30.901 --> 18:32.903
moving this process along.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.238
[Mary] And most recently,

18:34.321 --> 18:39.409
my husband took to describing
his sexual conquests

18:39.493 --> 18:43.247
with a one Georgina Hobart.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.665
I mean, that ass,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.500
it just hangs there,

18:46.583 --> 18:50.504
all perky like gravity doesn't affect it
or something.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.422
And the sex is just...

18:53.465 --> 18:56.218
oh, it's just head and shoulders
above you, darling.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.636
[clicks tongue]

18:57.719 --> 18:59.221
You used to kind of just...

19:00.389 --> 19:01.682
lay on me.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.517
I didn't think about it much at the time,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.271
but now I'm like,
you just weren't good at sex. [chuckles]

19:08.105 --> 19:08.981
I'm actually kinda...

19:09.064 --> 19:10.315
"...pissed about it."

19:10.399 --> 19:11.441
End quote.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.526
[crowd gasping]

19:12.609 --> 19:14.278
To the people of Texas,

19:14.361 --> 19:17.656
to my fellow citizens
all across this land,

19:17.739 --> 19:19.241
you should be afraid.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.702
Tino McCutcheon is a monster,

19:22.244 --> 19:23.620
and he is dangerous.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.082
I fear for the future of this country.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.876
-What the fuck?
-He wanted her to die.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.211
Oh. [chuckles] Oh, wow.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.463
Mmm, yeah, this-- this is a problem.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.673
A problem?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.592
Dede, this is like
a four-alarm dumpster fire,

19:36.675 --> 19:38.677
but the only thing in the dumpster
is manure!

19:38.760 --> 19:41.346
-How do you mean?
-What? Are you high?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.432
This is two kinds of horrible!

19:43.515 --> 19:46.351
Number one, our campaign is,
and I'm putting this delicately,

19:46.435 --> 19:47.728
not exactly where we wanted to be

19:47.811 --> 19:49.396
-four days out, and number two...
-But--

19:49.479 --> 19:52.232
...Tino is a monster
who's shtupping Georgina Hobart!

19:52.316 --> 19:54.234
-So?
-[panting] So?

19:54.318 --> 19:57.362
So, she's a younger woman
running for office, likely to win.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.031
It's obvious he's grooming her!

19:59.114 --> 20:00.115
He's gonna pick her!

20:00.199 --> 20:02.534
Not necessarily.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.119
He's not dead yet,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.246
and particularly if she's on his side,

20:06.330 --> 20:10.500
she's the most Teflon candidate
I've ever seen.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.629
If anybody can drag him out of this,

20:14.254 --> 20:15.255
-it's her.
-Oh, Dede...

20:16.215 --> 20:18.175
-Dede... Please, Dede.
-As you just heard, Carter,

20:18.258 --> 20:20.302
the senator is alleged to have claimed

20:20.385 --> 20:22.638
that intercourse with Georgina Hobart was,

20:22.721 --> 20:25.599
quote, "Head and shoulders above you,
darling,"

20:25.766 --> 20:29.770
and that he is, again I'm quoting,
"actually kind of pissed about it."

20:30.479 --> 20:32.189
-This is all a bunch of bullshit!
-[crashing]

20:33.857 --> 20:35.817
We shouldn't have
lined the computers up like that.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.028
James, I get it, okay?
I understand why you're upset.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.573
Because you left me out of the most
important decision of your campaign?

20:41.657 --> 20:44.952
Because you made us look like fools
without letting us know what was going on?

20:45.035 --> 20:47.788
-You're the only one who is upset.
-It worked. We have a shot now.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.706
-[James sighs]
-[McAfee] Sorry to interrupt,

20:49.790 --> 20:51.667
but Mary McCutcheon just woke up
from her coma,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.210
and Tino is dating your mom.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.922
-I don't have the bandwidth for that now.
-It's okay.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.340
-Copy.
-I don't know

20:58.423 --> 21:00.092
if I trust you anymore, any of you.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.552
What else are you doing
that you are not cluing me in on?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.304
I don't know if I wanna work
for a campaign

21:04.388 --> 21:05.514
where I don't trust anybody!

21:05.597 --> 21:07.140
Boo-hoo, James! Then quit.

21:07.766 --> 21:11.436
You should be saying, "Thank you, McAfee,
for buying spicy lube and hiding

21:11.520 --> 21:15.107
in a walk-in closet for literally hours,
listening to loud, acrobatic sex

21:15.190 --> 21:18.026
between a bisexual man
and a 63-year-old woman.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.280
Maybe you saved the campaign."
[exhales sharply]

21:22.281 --> 21:25.158
-Can I have your vape pen?
-Why?

21:25.242 --> 21:27.494
I'd like to puff on it.
I'm trying to calm down.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.290
I quit.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.250
-Wait, really?
-When?

21:33.333 --> 21:34.584
Just a couple of weeks ago.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.545
It's a personal choice,
it's not a big deal.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.172
Okay, can I remind everyone
that I'm still mad?

21:39.256 --> 21:41.800
Okay, James, I'm gonna send
tough love your way right now, okay?

21:41.883 --> 21:44.428
The reason you're upset,
it's because I placed my trust in McAfee

21:44.511 --> 21:45.721
and not in you.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.265
And do you know why?
It's because I know what you'd say.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.600
You'd say, "Don't do it." Right?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.227
You are risk-averse, James.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.397
When it really comes down to it,
you're not a killer.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.400
And because you felt the campaign
to be over,

21:58.483 --> 21:59.651
you showed zero interest

21:59.735 --> 22:02.696
in spending the last day and a half
registering young black and brown voters,

22:02.779 --> 22:05.866
which we, everyone else, did.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.535
And now we've got almost 500 people
who've never voted

22:08.618 --> 22:09.828
headed to the polls on Tuesday.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.164
Okay, all right. I get it.
Everybody, stop talking. [sighs]

22:12.247 --> 22:15.083
I get it. I'm the worst,
and I'm not mad anymore.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.669
And we didn't need those computers
anyway, so let's just drop it.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.006
But next time, please,

22:21.214 --> 22:23.925
can you actually keep me informed
as to what is going on?

22:24.009 --> 22:25.260
-No.
-[Payton] McAfee.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.554
Fine.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.223
-Fine.
-[office door opens]

22:31.641 --> 22:33.060
Oh, God. Guys?

22:38.690 --> 22:41.943
I just want to say that what you two did
has thrown our entire life into chaos.

22:42.986 --> 22:45.989
The past 24 hours, I've had to watch
the woman I love endure more than anyone--

22:46.073 --> 22:48.617
I'm sorry, I just have to ask,
is she really the woman you love?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.410
Because she's, like,
40 years older than you.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.871
Well, that's ignorant and ageist.
How dare you?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.499
Am I surprised as you that it happened?
Absolutely.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.709
But after what you did,
for you to sit there and--

22:57.793 --> 23:00.253
Okay, okay, uh, let's not get sidetracked,
all right?

23:00.337 --> 23:01.213
Look, William,

23:01.296 --> 23:03.757
I'm honestly so very sorry

23:03.840 --> 23:07.219
that this campaign has stooped
to this level, and when it's over,

23:07.302 --> 23:11.973
I think that we all have
some serious soul-searching to do.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.602
But can I please just ask you:
what exactly brings you here?

23:16.019 --> 23:17.270
I'm here to make an offer,

23:17.604 --> 23:20.482
in exchange for you dropping this thing
with me and Hadassah.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.442
Who is, I'm telling you,
the most loving, warm,

23:22.526 --> 23:25.404
-passionate partner--
-Okay. Okay. What is it?

23:25.487 --> 23:26.571
[William sighs]

23:27.155 --> 23:28.281
I'm just gonna say it.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.368
[muffled shriek]

23:33.370 --> 23:34.704
They're in a new throuple already.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.125
-My third of the bed was still warm.
-Wait, really?

23:38.208 --> 23:40.627
I did some digging.
His name is Hamilton. Gross.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.296
And he is, as it turns out,
a PhD candidate of Marcus's.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.173
I'm not sure Dede knows that.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.259
-Wow, okay.
-Another thing

23:47.342 --> 23:50.929
that Dede doesn't know, and I do,
is that Marcus is not the most honest man.

23:51.012 --> 23:54.224
He has, in the last several years,
secretly written papers for undergraduates

23:54.307 --> 23:57.644
at several prestigious universities
across the country in exchange for money.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.062
Kind of a lot of money.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.857
They pay in cash,
and he does not report the income,

24:01.940 --> 24:03.817
but it's in the mid-six figures.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.027
Wait, wait, wait.
You think Dede doesn't know this?

24:06.361 --> 24:07.195
I know she doesn't.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.572
He told me not to tell her.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.241
She's the rare politician
who doesn't do that sort of thing.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.159
She's clean.

24:12.659 --> 24:13.618
[Payton] Huh.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.413
Which is why I'm telling you.
If this were to get out,

24:16.872 --> 24:18.790
along with the fact that Dede had no idea,

24:18.874 --> 24:21.710
Marcus could be the one
who gets thrown to the wolves,

24:23.503 --> 24:24.588
not Hadassah.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.595
What do you wanna do?

24:34.681 --> 24:36.892
This is exactly
what I'm talking about, guys.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.768
I should be in on this.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.063
[reporters] Georgina!

24:42.147 --> 24:44.399
-[crowd grows quiet]
-[Georgina] Yes, it's true.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.902
I've been having an affair
with Tino McCutcheon.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.863
It's also true
that I am spectacular in bed.

24:50.113 --> 24:53.158
I work unusually hard
for a woman as attractive as I am.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.160
That affair is now over.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.412
I ended it with the following text:

24:58.997 --> 25:00.248
"Loser, bye."

25:01.291 --> 25:03.793
I had no idea
what kind of man Tino really was,

25:03.877 --> 25:06.838
and I would like to apologize
to his recently revived wife.

25:07.047 --> 25:07.964
Thank you.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.174
[reporters] Georgina!

25:09.257 --> 25:11.760
-Georgina!
-Oh, I have Senator McCutcheon for you.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.054
[reporters continue chattering]

25:14.137 --> 25:15.680
[Tino] Please don't do this to me.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.724
At least pretend until after I announce.

25:17.807 --> 25:20.560
You've lost me,
but you don't have to lose your campaign.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.354
You do need a Hail Mary, though.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.398
You need to announce your VP candidate,
and make it a woman.

25:26.608 --> 25:29.736
So, it's not a good look,
to say the least.

25:29.819 --> 25:30.737
I get that.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.448
I did not behave well. That's obvious.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.784
But, and you know, the truth is,

25:35.867 --> 25:38.245
and this is the political angle,
I think, too:

25:38.328 --> 25:42.290
How many people really know what it's like
to have a spouse in a coma?

25:42.374 --> 25:44.709
They have no idea what it's like.

25:44.793 --> 25:45.669
It's a trauma.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.588
And when a person is traumatized,
and they've done studies on this,

25:48.672 --> 25:51.675
that person is literally not themself.

25:51.758 --> 25:55.470
Sure, but you did kind of suggest
to your wife

25:55.554 --> 25:57.889
that if she were to die,

25:57.973 --> 26:00.850
that would sort of be the outcome
you'd prefer.

26:00.934 --> 26:04.187
I didn't want to see her suffer.
And, not to be crass,

26:04.271 --> 26:06.273
that press conference,
I think a lot of people said,

26:06.356 --> 26:09.025
"Well, yeah, if I was married
to that lady, I'd want her to die too."

26:09.776 --> 26:11.319
But that gets me to the polling.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.739
My favorables among the women
has taken a hit, sure.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.657
But among men?

26:15.740 --> 26:16.700
Hasn't moved.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.328
-[scoffs]
-So, really, I'm still in good shape.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.246
[Dede] Mmm.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.915
And if I were to announce you, and soon,

26:23.999 --> 26:27.168
and you came out in a strong,
full-throated defense,

26:27.252 --> 26:28.878
we think that stops the bleeding.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.090
Wait, I'm con-- confused. How soon?

26:32.173 --> 26:34.718
Tuesday night. After you win the election.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.886
You fold it into your acceptance speech

26:36.970 --> 26:41.349
about policy, not personal failings,
being what elections should be about.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.185
We spend the next few days
showing a little leg together.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.646
Then I announce my run
with you on the ticket.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.316
It can all happen really fast.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.483
Okay.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.236
Let me think about it.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.451
[Hadassah chuckles softly, sobs]

27:00.994 --> 27:02.120
[whimpers]

27:03.872 --> 27:04.873
[despairing sigh]

27:05.332 --> 27:07.459
I'm so old.

27:07.751 --> 27:08.877
[sobbing]

27:08.960 --> 27:12.172
Listen-- What-- What-- What--
What are you doing?

27:13.048 --> 27:14.924
What does it look like I'm doing?
[sniffles]

27:15.008 --> 27:17.093
I'm not gonna clear out of here
after I do this.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.054
I'm gonna do the press conference
this afternoon

27:19.137 --> 27:21.931
and go straight home
and watch What Women Want.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.308
Would you please stop a beat?

27:23.391 --> 27:25.101
-What is it?
-I'm flying to California.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.063
-I'm gonna talk to Georgina Hobart.
-[cackles]

27:28.313 --> 27:29.522
Good luck with that.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.608
[whimpering chuckle]

27:33.193 --> 27:35.153
Not to take anything away from your son

27:35.236 --> 27:37.864
who is an extremely talented politician

27:37.947 --> 27:39.199
with a very bright future,

27:39.282 --> 27:42.869
but if I could just leave you
with these two very important points:

27:42.952 --> 27:45.080
No one has done more for women

27:45.163 --> 27:46.665
in the state of New York than I have,

27:46.748 --> 27:48.333
and by taking me out,

27:48.416 --> 27:51.795
it not only hurts me,
but it sets back the entire struggle.

27:51.878 --> 27:55.006
And second, by weaponizing my throuple,

27:55.090 --> 27:56.549
he's casting judgment on it.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.426
-He's slut-shaming me.
-[Georgina] Yeah.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.470
Yeah, I mean, I get all that.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.556
Um, if I'm honest,

28:03.640 --> 28:05.934
the reason that I agreed
to have lunch with you

28:06.017 --> 28:09.813
is because I... am just fascinated

28:09.896 --> 28:12.941
by how this whole throuple thing works.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.820
I mean, I tend to get bored
in relationships very quickly,

28:16.903 --> 28:20.824
and I always thought
that it was a combination of lame choices

28:20.907 --> 28:22.951
and intimacy issues.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.911
But now I'm thinking

28:24.994 --> 28:28.748
that maybe being with one person
is just inevitably boring.

28:28.832 --> 28:32.544
So, I'm happy to get into detail with you
about that,

28:32.627 --> 28:35.255
-but I really think--
-Great, because I was wondering

28:35.338 --> 28:39.134
if you think this works
with two women and one man.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.719
[Dede] I'm happy to get into that,

28:40.802 --> 28:43.680
but, um, my election is in two days,

28:43.763 --> 28:47.016
and the situation with Payton
is acute and urgent.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.811
Look, you seem great, really,

28:49.894 --> 28:53.356
and, um, I've only been
in this politics thing for a month,

28:53.440 --> 28:55.650
so, mad respect to you

28:55.734 --> 28:57.861
for being in the game so long,
especially as a woman.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.238
But my son, he's his own man.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.449
I don't control him nor would I try to.

29:02.532 --> 29:06.161
It's just-- It's not my style as a mother.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.998
You know, his victories are his,
and his mistakes are his.

29:11.791 --> 29:13.585
My mother was like that too,

29:14.043 --> 29:17.422
but that's just because she needed to work
two jobs to put me through Brearley

29:17.505 --> 29:20.383
and, um, pay for our little
one-bedroom apartment

29:20.467 --> 29:22.135
on 111th Street.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.554
[voice trembles] And my...

29:26.347 --> 29:28.558
my father left us when I was seven,

29:28.641 --> 29:31.936
and, um, he started a whole new family.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.647
He seemed happy. I would--
I would see him around town sometimes.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.526
Suddenly, you living with two men
makes a lot more sense.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.280
I tell you this not for sympathy

29:42.572 --> 29:44.741
but to let you know that I am a fighter,

29:44.908 --> 29:48.077
and I will do whatever it takes to win,

29:48.161 --> 29:51.039
even if it means hurting your son
to do it.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.708
Sounds great. Should we order something?

29:55.084 --> 29:55.960
Sir?

29:57.462 --> 29:58.505
[sighs heavily]

30:01.508 --> 30:03.510
-Where the fuck is Astrid?
-She wasn't feeling well.

30:03.593 --> 30:04.928
[door slams]

30:05.011 --> 30:06.513
Sorry, I came as fast as I could.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.598
-Okay, good. Now we can start.
-[James] Uh, sorry.

30:08.681 --> 30:11.351
Is McAfee so important
that we can't start a meeting without her?

30:11.434 --> 30:13.520
If I was the last to arrive,
you guys would've started.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.063
-Jesus, James.
-For God's sake.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.148
[Payton] Okay, everybody,
please just shut up. Okay?

30:17.232 --> 30:19.609
Listen,
I've been thinking very hard about this,

30:20.068 --> 30:22.779
about the campaign so far,

30:22.862 --> 30:24.781
about the futures of every person
in this room,

30:24.864 --> 30:26.407
and what I'm about to do in four hours

30:26.491 --> 30:28.618
when I sit down with Riva Mandel
from the Times.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.246
I think doing this to Dede's wrong.

30:31.996 --> 30:32.872
[scoffs]

30:33.206 --> 30:34.040
I agree.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.793
I've thought about it, and I think
that destroying this woman

30:36.876 --> 30:39.045
in this way is wrong,
and I don't think we should do it.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.171
This was your whole thing.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.508
I know, James. I was the one
in that closet, listening to the sex.

30:44.509 --> 30:48.555
Payton, we're way behind,
but your numbers are on the way up.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.682
The focus on climate emergency,

30:50.765 --> 30:53.476
the appeal with young voters,
you have a brand now,

30:53.560 --> 30:54.644
a national brand.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.813
And if you smear this woman
in the way you're about to,

30:56.896 --> 30:59.190
you tarnish that brand,
and I think it's permanent.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.484
Suddenly,
you're not a kid with convictions

31:01.568 --> 31:04.153
who's willing to lose an election
for the sake of those convictions.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.573
You're just a politician
who'll do anything to win,

31:06.656 --> 31:08.700
when what young people want
is authenticity.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.411
You have that now. You have these voters.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.621
You could lose this election,
and they will follow you.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.207
-I can't believe this.
-I'm not so sure you can say

31:16.291 --> 31:18.251
we definitely are gonna lose this one.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.837
We've registered more than 500 new voters.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.463
Who's to say they don't put us
over the top?

31:22.547 --> 31:25.133
They might, but we have to tell her voters
to stay home,

31:25.216 --> 31:26.926
and we do that by going
to The New York Times

31:27.010 --> 31:28.344
and telling them she's swampy.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.680
-But she isn't.
-But she is if her husband is.

31:30.763 --> 31:33.516
She is if her household's collecting
cash payments for college cheating.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.517
This is a no-brainer.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.936
This is the only thing
that's gonna give us a shot.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.104
But what if it doesn't?

31:39.105 --> 31:40.315
You know? What if...

31:41.232 --> 31:42.650
What if we run with this

31:42.734 --> 31:45.361
and it ruins all the work
we've done so far,

31:45.445 --> 31:46.487
and then I still don't win?

31:46.946 --> 31:49.115
You know? Am I still the same candidate
I am right now?

31:49.198 --> 31:50.742
Am I still a rising star,

31:50.825 --> 31:53.244
or am I just a young,

31:54.245 --> 31:55.288
rich asshole...

31:56.122 --> 31:58.082
who played very dirty and still lost?

32:00.084 --> 32:01.252
[sighs] Alice?

32:01.586 --> 32:02.545
Don't do it.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.382
Win or lose on your own merits.
Fight another day.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.051
-Skye?
-I agree.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.554
We've done a lot of really good work.
Don't ruin it.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.016
-James?
-[scoffs] Does it matter what I think?

32:16.184 --> 32:19.228
-I'm outvoted.
-Yes, I want to know what you think.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.355
[James sighs]

32:22.565 --> 32:23.524
I agree.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.276
Don't do it. It's not a good look.

32:26.486 --> 32:30.281
Okay. Okay, James, call Riva,
tell her there is no story.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.992
I need to try and get some sleep.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.663
I'm proud of us, you guys. All right?

32:37.789 --> 32:38.915
This was the right move.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.342
[office door opens, shuts]

32:55.306 --> 32:57.517
Are we just gonna leave that
there on the table?

32:59.185 --> 33:00.186
[Astrid] Sorry.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.941
[Payton] We use condoms when we have sex.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.234
Are you sure it's mine?

33:06.317 --> 33:08.027
You're the only people
I've banged in months.

33:08.444 --> 33:11.447
So unless it's some
immaculate conception...

33:13.741 --> 33:16.285
Condoms are only 98.8 percent effective.

33:16.369 --> 33:20.498
So I guess your swimmers snuck in
through that 1.2 percent window.

33:20.581 --> 33:23.209
[sighs] God, my sperm's
as ambitious as I am.

33:23.751 --> 33:26.295
I'm pregnant, too.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.674
Get out. Wow.

33:30.174 --> 33:33.094
I guess it is true what they say
about women's cycles lining up. [chuckles]

33:33.177 --> 33:35.513
-[Payton] Yeah.
-What are you planning on doing about it?

33:35.596 --> 33:37.390
-What are you planning on doing?
-We're...

33:38.683 --> 33:40.268
going to make an announcement

33:40.351 --> 33:41.519
and get married.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.940
It's good politics,
and I won't have my child being a bastard.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.483
So where does that leave me?

33:48.401 --> 33:52.155
You get to wear the big, white dress
and be queen for the day, again,

33:52.238 --> 33:53.281
and I'm, what,

33:53.364 --> 33:55.825
some... knocked-up whore?

33:55.908 --> 33:57.493
You joined our relationship, Astrid.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.537
You knew where you fell
in the order of things.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.205
There's no need to be cold, Alice.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.416
Listen, whatever you choose to do,

34:04.042 --> 34:08.629
we will support you financially
and emotionally the very best we can.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.591
And you'll have to sign an NDA
with very specific language

34:11.674 --> 34:13.968
to make sure no one ever finds out
I'm the father, but...

34:14.427 --> 34:15.887
I'm not collateral.

34:15.970 --> 34:18.056
I'm not a problem on a checklist.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.475
I am having exactly the same experience
as Alice.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.143
Hers is no better than mine.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.230
Screw you both.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.274
I'm out.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.110
You know what?

34:32.153 --> 34:34.405
Maybe I'll just have to have
a press conference of my own.

34:51.672 --> 34:52.548
Hi.

34:52.882 --> 34:56.052
Payton was going to cancel,
but I have the story.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.888
All right, shoot.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.017
Dede Standish is a swamp creature.

35:03.101 --> 35:03.935
Pretends she's clean,

35:04.018 --> 35:06.562
but her husband makes
upwards of six figures in cash every year

35:06.646 --> 35:09.023
ghostwriting for college kids
all across the country.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.525
He's been doing this for years.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.027
Jesus. Who's your source?

35:13.111 --> 35:14.070
William Ward.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.906
He will also tell you
he's banging Hadassah Gold.

35:17.740 --> 35:18.741
They live together.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.869
That throuple stuff,
it's all smoke and mirrors.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.206
When she aired that ad,
it was already over.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.251
The guy that Dede and Marcus
are porking now...

35:30.962 --> 35:32.338
is one of Marcus' students.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.008
Holy sh--

35:37.301 --> 35:40.096
[instrumental theme music plays]
