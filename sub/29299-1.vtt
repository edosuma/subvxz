00:00.935 --> 00:04.003
(suspenseful music)

00:14.815 --> 00:17.649
(dramatic music)

00:27.895 --> 00:31.663
(intense dramatic music)

00:31.665 --> 00:34.466
(static buzzing)

00:45.746 --> 00:48.414
(creepy music)

02:03.491 --> 02:05.457
(suspenseful music)

02:05.459 --> 02:08.260
(carnival music)

03:08.455 --> 03:11.256
(wind whistling)

03:18.933 --> 03:21.767
(dramatic music)

03:23.971 --> 03:26.605
(swanky music)

03:40.854 --> 03:41.987
- This don't sit right with me.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.690
This could get ugly real quick.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.292
- Don't you dare be getting
cold feet on me now.

03:47.294 --> 03:50.162
And don't you dare be feeling
sorry for that asshole.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.264
If anyone deserves it, it's him.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.734
- I don't hate Big Ronnie
because he's an asshole.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.237
Hell, it's probably the one
thing I respect about the man.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.439
Most of my best friends are
assholes.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.273
I think they oughta give out

04:01.275 --> 04:03.242
an award for the biggest
asshole.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.644
Like a placard and they
put it on the wall,

04:05.646 --> 04:08.313
then everyone can see
what they're dealing with.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.083
Hell, I could be an asshole
myself from time to time.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.852
It's assholes that get ahead
in the world, sweetheart.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.520
Your husband didn't make all
that dough

04:15.522 --> 04:16.989
by being Mother Theresa.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.826
No, assholes, I don't have a
problem with.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.894
But I can't stand a creep.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.529
- That fits Ronnie's description
well

04:24.531 --> 04:25.597
by the way he treats me.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.732
- You deserve better.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.701
I'm not sure why you decided
to go with a bum like me.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.404
- Because I do what I want.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.338
- Yeah.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.407
- Tonight, we're gonna do as we
planned.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.708
- Ah, but stealing?

04:36.710 --> 04:39.845
- Stealing from the crooked
ain't stealing proper.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.246
Are you scared of him?

04:41.248 --> 04:43.448
Scared he's gonna call the
circus mafia after you?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.183
- I can handle myself.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.385
I'm scared for you.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.920
I ain't afraid to admit it.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.090
I can get a new shirt
and a different haircut

04:52.092 --> 04:53.859
and nobody will recognize me
tomorrow.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.193
I'm nobody.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.662
I can disappear.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.665
But you, you ain't hiding from
nothing,

05:00.501 --> 05:04.303
and I ain't leaving you
for prison or worse.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.071
- Then stay with me.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.240
Together we can open
that son of a bitch safe

05:08.242 --> 05:11.743
and we're gonna take every penny
he has.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.445
Then we can finally be free.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.147
We could finally be a family.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.284
But I don't wanna have a baby in
prison.

05:19.286 --> 05:22.888
- Savanna, I'd go through
hell and back for you.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.156
- Would you now?

05:27.294 --> 05:28.126
(thudding)

05:28.128 --> 05:30.929
(dramatic music)

05:32.333 --> 05:35.100
- You know you've had
a really fucked up day

05:35.102 --> 05:37.669
when you wake up to
figure out your whole life

05:37.671 --> 05:42.040
is copied from a cheap
dime store pulp novel.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.942
(chuckling)

05:43.944 --> 05:45.977
You're used goods, toots.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.680
It's how used I didn't know till
now.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.983
And you, no talent dead beat.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.821
Not a grateful bone in your
lousy body.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.422
Not one.

05:57.424 --> 06:02.561
I took you in, I gave you a
home, I treated you like family,

06:02.563 --> 06:04.996
and this is what you give me?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.098
Sit your ass down.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.867
I said sit you dumb bastard.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.372
(light dramatic music)

06:16.410 --> 06:18.777
- Ronnie, you brought this on
yourself.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.847
You treat our marriage like
you treat this fleabag circus.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.082
You don't give a shit about me.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.351
I'm just your arm candy, baby.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.520
And I'm tired of being a candy
cane

06:28.522 --> 06:30.088
hanging off of your wrist.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.523
- Maybe you're right.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.160
Maybe it is my fault.

06:35.162 --> 06:39.698
After all, you were a lousy
two bit skank when I met you.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.235
Waitin' tables at that dive on
Route 66.

06:43.237 --> 06:47.305
You had that skinny
boyfriend with the worm dick.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.241
(chuckling)

06:49.243 --> 06:50.942
You were all over me, lady.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.311
Like taffy on an August
afternoon.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.614
I shoulda known.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.617
I shoulda known you'd jump
on whatever comes along

06:58.619 --> 07:01.787
that strikes you as a
better deal, a bigger haul.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.155
- Fuck you, Ronnie.
(dramatic music)

07:03.157 --> 07:06.591
I have been nothing but faithful
to you in this marriage.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.427
Until--
- Until you got

07:08.429 --> 07:11.396
good and bored, until
something better came along

07:11.398 --> 07:12.998
and caught your attention.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.067
- I was gonna say until you
turned into some nasty ogre.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.204
Always hateful, stomping
around with a clinched fist,

07:19.206 --> 07:23.074
have nothing good to say
to me or anybody else.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.977
You're a light bulb that has
gone out.

07:25.979 --> 07:29.114
You are milk that has turned
sour.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.651
Baby, I'm tired of the taste.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.052
Cash loves me.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.688
He treats me like a decent human
being.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.794
- So, you're in love.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.730
Ready to run away into the
night.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.768
But love don't pay the
bills, does it, honey?

07:50.737 --> 07:51.903
(chuckling)

07:51.905 --> 07:53.305
So let me guess.

07:53.307 --> 07:58.310
You two lovebirds planed
on stealing from me,

07:58.312 --> 08:01.112
making a quick cash grab and
running out for the highway.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.548
- Hell, Ronnie, that money
ain't even really yours.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.550
You and halfwit over
here said that you took

08:05.552 --> 08:07.986
from that Spanish lone shark
named Miguel.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.422
So I figured I could use a
little money for after dealing

08:10.424 --> 08:13.058
with your nasty bullshit for so
long.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.193
Consider it alimony,
motherfucker.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.362
(dramatic music)
(Cash screaming)

08:17.364 --> 08:22.400
(Ronnie chuckling)
(Cash groaning)

08:22.903 --> 08:23.869
(Savanna gasping)

08:23.871 --> 08:26.104
- There's some alimony for ya,
bitch.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.939
How do you look now, lover boy?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.909
(Ronnie chuckling)

08:34.581 --> 08:37.048
- [Savanna] No, stop, no!

08:37.050 --> 08:39.618
- Savanna, what are you doing?

08:39.620 --> 08:42.120
Don't point that thing at Cash.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.788
You might hurt him.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.460
- Ronnie, Ronnie, let go.
- I guess she's tired

08:48.462 --> 08:50.362
of you too, Cash my boy.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.196
(Savanna screaming)
(gunshot banging)

08:51.198 --> 08:54.165
(Ronnie chuckling)

08:55.202 --> 08:56.468
Oh, yeah.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.474
Now.
- You dirty, evil, nasty

09:02.476 --> 09:04.776
son of a bitch!

09:04.777 --> 09:07.077
- Oh, I love it when you
say such sweet things to me.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.014
- Kill me too, you fucking pig.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.616
- Oh, Savanna, no, no, no.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.618
I'm not gonna kill you.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.122
No, you're gonna carry
this with you everyday,

09:17.124 --> 09:19.791
and you're gonna see
this over and over again.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.127
- I'll go to the cops.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.362
- Yeah, call the cops.

09:24.364 --> 09:28.567
I mean, after all, it's
your gun, doll face.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.202
Your fingerprints.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.605
The way this all looks to me
though,

09:33.607 --> 09:36.141
is these no life fuckers tried
to break

09:36.143 --> 09:39.678
into my office and steal our
money.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.147
And baby, you saved the day.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.182
You caught him red handed.

09:45.485 --> 09:48.887
- Right.
- Or, or, I could put

09:48.889 --> 09:51.156
a round of lead in that
pretty little face of yours,

09:51.158 --> 09:53.258
like I did your boyfriend.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.527
Or we could call the cops,

09:55.529 --> 09:58.730
tell 'em you got your period
and went batshit crazy.

09:58.732 --> 09:59.998
Starting shooting everything up

10:00.000 --> 10:02.901
like some damn Clint Eastwood
movie.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.204
Let you cool your hard
ass in prison a while,

10:07.174 --> 10:08.807
with the dykes.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.175
Your call, baby.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.309
- Okay, okay.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.179
We caught them stealing.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.848
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.350
(Ronnie chuckling)

10:18.352 --> 10:21.086
And true love saves the day.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.755
Now get your ass ready.

10:23.757 --> 10:28.259
The show's starting' and we have
a new act debuting tonight.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.761
- New act?

10:29.763 --> 10:32.831
(suspenseful music)

10:37.938 --> 10:43.008
(carnival music)
(audience cheering)

10:46.780 --> 10:49.314
- And now for something really
different.

10:49.316 --> 10:53.385
Ladies and gentlemen, if
you are faint at heart

10:53.387 --> 10:57.756
or you are squeamish, now
is the time to turn away,

10:57.758 --> 11:01.426
because The Midnight Madness
Circus of a Thousand Wonders

11:01.428 --> 11:04.863
has truly turned into the
circus of the Macabre.

11:04.865 --> 11:09.467
Witness our fearless femme
fatal in a fatal fix.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.202
Any last words, dear?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.037
(popping)

11:12.039 --> 11:17.108
(clowns chuckling)
(carnival music)

11:25.218 --> 11:27.786
- Hey, doll face, are
you ready to give them

11:27.788 --> 11:30.188
the show of your lifetime?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.724
It's going to stab the audience.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.795
- Look, look at her.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.030
(humming)

11:53.380 --> 11:55.780
(squeaking)

12:00.087 --> 12:02.053
- Are you ready for the show?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.788
Let's get to the point.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.094
Let's dart into action.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.996
(Ronnie cackling)

12:14.768 --> 12:16.668
Lousy two bit skank.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.439
Oh, yeah, this should drive it
home.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.440
(dramatic music)

12:22.442 --> 12:24.509
Come get it little darling.

12:27.948 --> 12:28.880
(balloon popping)
(audience gasping)

12:28.882 --> 12:30.215
- This is a great time.

12:32.486 --> 12:35.887
(suspenseful music)

12:35.889 --> 12:36.921
(balloon popping)

12:36.923 --> 12:39.824
(Ronnie cackling)

12:40.627 --> 12:43.228
- I'm gonna poke a lot of holes
in you,

12:43.230 --> 12:48.266
until it all runs out and I
get the satisfaction I want,

12:48.969 --> 12:52.971
and these people get
the show that they want.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.607
They've paid good money.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.108
And away we go.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.884
- And there you have it, ladies
and gents.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.853
Another crazy night under
the twisted big top.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.556
Tell your friends we're here all
weekend,

13:11.558 --> 13:14.159
and don't forget to
leave the kiddos at home.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.795
Come back to The Midnight
Madness

13:16.797 --> 13:19.397
Circus of a Thousand Wonders,

13:19.399 --> 13:21.966
where anything can happen.

13:22.769 --> 13:26.504
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

13:26.506 --> 13:29.107
And thank you all, good night.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.278
(carnival music)

13:42.322 --> 13:45.123
(dramatic music)

13:58.205 --> 14:00.405
- Now that was a show.

14:01.708 --> 14:06.611
And just think, only three
more towns until our tour ends.

14:06.613 --> 14:10.782
And this was just so much fun.

14:12.052 --> 14:12.917
(Ronnie giggling)
Hm?

14:14.087 --> 14:15.653
(Savanna mumbling)

14:15.655 --> 14:17.622
Hm, what's that?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.858
You really should stop mumbling.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.326
- Oh!

14:21.328 --> 14:23.161
Ronnie, baby, listen.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.832
Lesson learned, can't
we just kiss and make up

14:27.834 --> 14:29.667
like we used to after a fight?

14:29.669 --> 14:32.737
- No, Savanna, you broke my
heart.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.806
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.275
You didn't even know I had a
heart.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.176
But I do.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.981
And you broke it into tiny
little pieces.

14:47.120 --> 14:52.190
No, no, no, I think this
is gonna take some time

14:52.392 --> 14:53.591
to get over.

14:55.829 --> 14:58.263
And I think it's best if
you find somewhere else

14:58.265 --> 15:00.198
to camp out for a few nights.

15:02.068 --> 15:07.105
Wash that nasty stink off of
your ass.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.976
Give me some time to heal so

15:11.978 --> 15:15.013
I don't murder you in your
sleep.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.982
(Ronnie chuckling)

15:24.224 --> 15:27.025
(Savanna crying)

15:30.630 --> 15:33.464
(floor creaking)

15:34.868 --> 15:36.200
- Autumn.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.669
- It's just me, child.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.337
- Thank god it's you.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.439
I thought that evil bastard came
back.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.274
- Not one of your better
nights there sweetie.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.009
You'd think your friend Cash
would

15:45.011 --> 15:47.011
have something to say about all
of this.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.546
- Cash is dead, Autumn.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.748
That son of a bitch killed him
right

15:50.750 --> 15:52.350
in front of me in cold blood.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.887
- [Autumn] It just kills
me what they did to you.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.995
- That pile of dicks isn't
gonna get away with this.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.230
I don't care what it takes.

16:07.133 --> 16:11.970
I'm tired of feeling sorry,
like it was all a mistake.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.472
He said he would kill me if I
didn't agree

16:14.474 --> 16:18.576
to this ridiculous story, and
now he plans on doing this

16:18.578 --> 16:19.978
until the end of the tour.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.949
I gotta do something, Autumn,
and it may end up killing me.

16:24.951 --> 16:27.719
But that nasty motherfucker
deserves to take a deep,

16:27.721 --> 16:30.355
dark nap if it's the last thing
I do.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.157
(dramatic music)

16:36.863 --> 16:38.663
(car door slamming)

16:38.665 --> 16:41.499
(zipper buzzing)

16:43.937 --> 16:46.771
- You have no appreciation for
anything.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.008
I spent my hard earned money,
take you and your momma

16:50.010 --> 16:52.977
to the circus and this
is the thanks I get?

16:53.813 --> 16:54.679
What the fuck are you doing?

16:54.681 --> 16:55.847
Get your ass in that car.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.849
- Steve, let's all calm
down and go home.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.117
Everyone else is gone.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.752
- We'll calm down and
go home when this little

17:00.754 --> 17:04.222
brat here gives me an apology.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.157
You hear me, Rachel?
(taser zapping)

17:06.159 --> 17:07.992
- Keep your drunk hands
off me, you asshole.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.293
- I'll drive.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.129
Let's all go home and
just sort this out.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.532
- I'm perfectly fine, but
this sick ass little brat here

17:15.335 --> 17:16.167
is fucking ruining everything.

17:16.169 --> 17:21.239
- Steve.
(taser zapping)

17:22.609 --> 17:24.976
- Shit, Dad?
- Steve, Steve.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.277
- Dad?
- Steve.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.146
Rachel, what did you do?

17:28.148 --> 17:29.080
- Fuck this.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.883
(dramatic music)

17:46.466 --> 17:48.766
- Any of you smiley
faced fuckers gonna help?

18:05.952 --> 18:08.619
For a skinny fucker,
he sure is heavy.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.555
- Dead weight, boss.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.256
- You got that right, Chuckles.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.759
- Uh, boss, I'm Chuckles.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.829
- It was a figure of
speech, oh, never mind.

18:17.831 --> 18:22.567
Okay, so I figure we cut
his ass up nice and small,

18:22.569 --> 18:24.135
in nice little pieces.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.404
That-a-way there's less of a
chance of someone finding the

18:26.406 --> 18:30.308
body and more of a chance of
some animal eating his ass.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.010
Look boys, I know it's a lot to
ask,

18:33.012 --> 18:35.346
but haven't I always taken care
of you?

18:35.348 --> 18:38.683
Bobo, when you had that issue
with that little blonde honey

18:38.685 --> 18:42.019
in the miniskirt, didn't
I make it all go away?

18:42.021 --> 18:44.222
- Bitch said she was into
clowns, Ronnie.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.757
How was I supposed to know
she was the mayor's kid?

18:46.759 --> 18:49.127
- Nevertheless, I took care of
it.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.129
I do right by all you guys.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.797
What do you say, guys?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.499
Help a buddy out here.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.636
We gotta do this the old
fashioned way.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.106
Nice and quiet, no disturbances.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.909
(dramatic music)

19:05.945 --> 19:08.846
(flesh squishing)

19:35.308 --> 19:38.142
(clowns panting)

19:51.257 --> 19:54.225
(clowns chuckling)

20:01.301 --> 20:02.333
Oh, yeah.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.368
Oh yeah, get it up there.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.603
Oh, slice it up.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.071
Yeah, little small pieces.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.272
Yeah, we want 'em into small
pieces,

20:08.274 --> 20:10.308
so we can hide the body a lot
better.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.776
(Ronnie cackling)

20:11.778 --> 20:12.677
Oh, yeah.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.847
(blood splattering)

20:16.849 --> 20:18.683
- You sure you wanna do this?

20:18.685 --> 20:22.453
Once we begin, it cannot be
undone.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.689
- That motherfucker killed Cash.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.390
After all the bullshit he put me
through,

20:26.392 --> 20:28.392
he deserves what happens.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.561
But, Autumn, will this work?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.897
What's gonna happen when we do
this?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.966
- This is why I'm asking if
you're sure.

20:36.035 --> 20:40.972
You've been through so much
already and us using a spell

20:40.974 --> 20:46.043
as evil as this against
another, it could backfire.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.646
It can be dangerous.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.848
- What the hell do I have to
lose, Autumn?

20:50.850 --> 20:53.551
That fucker deserves to pay
for what he did to Cash,

20:53.553 --> 20:54.852
and to me.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.521
He has all the money, mine too.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.223
So what choice do I have?

20:59.225 --> 21:00.391
- You could just run.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.726
- And go where?

21:01.728 --> 21:04.862
I have no money, no family, no
friends.

21:05.798 --> 21:09.867
Big Ronnie has people all over
the country, criminal types.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.137
The scumbags that would slit
your throat just for fun.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.673
So he'd have everybody hunting
for me.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.875
So I'm fucked either way.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.511
At least this way, I'm calling
the shots.

21:20.513 --> 21:24.315
And it's as you said for
yourself, I'll get my revenge.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.651
- You'll call the shots, sure.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.020
But neither one of us are in
control here.

21:38.865 --> 21:42.600
(speaking foreign language)

21:46.706 --> 21:49.607
(thunder booming)

21:58.418 --> 22:00.651
Stay there without escape.

22:01.988 --> 22:07.058
Witness my darkness, my
vengeance
against your mortal flesh.

22:10.430 --> 22:10.828
Repeat this with me.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.969
- [Both] Power of anger, power
of hate.

22:18.971 --> 22:22.707
Discord brings you to your fate.

22:22.709 --> 22:27.278
Demons of anger, demons of hate.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.148
Bring him down, I will not wait.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.451
So it shall be.

22:33.453 --> 22:37.755
Vengeance now may manifest.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.124
- Here me, dark prince.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.859
Give my hatred life.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.529
Manifest to destroy my enemies.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.301
(thunder booming)

22:51.537 --> 22:54.872
Manifest to bring about my
vengeance.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.807
(sparking)

22:56.809 --> 22:59.110
(chanting)

23:03.616 --> 23:06.617
(shovel crunching)

23:11.791 --> 23:13.157
- Fill that hole, Satchel.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.259
That goes for the
rest of you guys, too.

23:15.261 --> 23:16.994
We don't anything
digging him up.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.830
(thunder booming)

23:19.832 --> 23:21.699
- Looks like a
storm's comin', boss.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.736
(dramatic music)

23:26.839 --> 23:28.105
- That doesn't look good.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.774
Come on, boys, get in the truck.

23:42.221 --> 23:46.056
(car engine sputtering)

23:46.058 --> 23:48.025
Hang on everybody.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.829
I don't know what this is, but
it's hitting us really hard.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.632
(wind whistling)
(thunder booming)

23:54.634 --> 23:56.967
(chanting)

24:04.343 --> 24:06.076
- Give me your hand.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.483
(flesh squishing)

24:16.556 --> 24:20.291
(speaking foreign language)

24:45.351 --> 24:47.751
(squishing)

25:08.541 --> 25:09.373
- Autumn!

25:09.375 --> 25:12.276
(Autumn growling)

25:17.917 --> 25:19.750
Autumn, what the fuck?

25:19.752 --> 25:23.487
(speaking foreign language)

25:37.003 --> 25:39.904
(Ronnie groaning)

25:43.609 --> 25:46.410
(Ronnie yelling)

25:58.591 --> 26:01.358
- [Autumn] Give my hatred life.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.495
Manifest to bring about my
vengeance.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.065
- My heart.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.338
(dramatic music)

26:14.340 --> 26:16.907
- [Ronnie] Hang on, everybody.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.311
- Autumn.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.313
- Oh.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.449
Fuck, this has never happened
before.

26:26.752 --> 26:30.254
Savanna, you must leave here.

26:30.256 --> 26:34.224
Go anywhere, but you cannot stay
here.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.559
Go.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.595
- But, what will I do?

26:37.597 --> 26:39.063
Where will I go?

26:39.065 --> 26:41.231
You're the only family I have
left.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.367
- Just go anywhere.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.269
Be happy.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.837
I'll find you someday.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.910
(light dramatic music)

27:05.558 --> 27:08.525
(tires screeching)

27:09.862 --> 27:11.528
- Holy hell.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.497
Is it Halloween time, already?

27:13.499 --> 27:15.165
- You got jokes.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.867
- You gotta have a huge sack of
marbles

27:16.869 --> 27:18.936
running around this area like
that.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.471
- Well, why's that?

27:20.473 --> 27:23.574
- Anyone going up and down
the road dressed as Elvis,

27:23.576 --> 27:26.143
with a guitar on his
back and this thumb out,

27:26.145 --> 27:27.978
asking for trouble in this town.

27:27.980 --> 27:28.912
- So you're telling me a brother

27:28.914 --> 27:31.348
can't enjoy some Elvis around
here?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.484
- Have you looked in
the mirror lately, man?

27:33.486 --> 27:36.954
I'd say it's a little more
than enjoying some Elvis.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.189
I'd take it, you're
playing some kinda show?

27:39.191 --> 27:41.125
- Yeah, I'm toured with a group
of guys.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.327
We performed in Vegas some years
back.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.229
My vehicle broke down about 20
miles.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.598
Local mechanic said it was a
lost cause.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.366
No one would pick my ass up.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.202
- Yeah, I wonder why.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.471
Well, hop in bud.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.306
Let's hit the road.

28:00.513 --> 28:05.582
(car engine rumbling)
(rock music)

28:12.491 --> 28:15.826
(bar patrons cheering)

28:17.930 --> 28:20.330
(whistling)

28:50.763 --> 28:52.796
- And they actually serve food
here, too?

28:52.798 --> 28:55.132
- Best Italian steak in the
state.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.767
I wouldn't steer you wrong.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.669
It's got real fresh beef.

28:58.671 --> 28:59.570
- Uh huh.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.357
- Oh, hey, just give us
a few minutes, honey.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.629
(bar patrons cheering)

29:32.104 --> 29:36.673
(bar patrons talking over each
other)

29:44.683 --> 29:46.650
- Hey, no touching, sugar.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.685
- Come on, Bambi, come on.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.354
- Hey, motherfucker, you piece
of shit.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.889
You can't be treating the girls
like that.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.191
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are, but--

29:54.193 --> 29:57.261
(bottle shattering)

29:59.732 --> 30:02.533
(fists thudding)

30:07.740 --> 30:08.639
- Thanks, man.

30:09.575 --> 30:10.407
- You better get that looked at.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.142
You might need stitches.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.777
- Nah, I'll be okay.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.547
I'm used to dealing with
this fucking piece of shit.

30:16.549 --> 30:18.782
(gasping)

30:19.652 --> 30:21.652
- I've had enough of this shit.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.520
Do you like this job?

30:23.522 --> 30:25.856
- Yes, I, (stuttering), I'm
sorry.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.959
- Kurt, why did you do
that to this motherfucker?

30:28.961 --> 30:31.395
- He got real handsy with Bambi
there.

30:31.397 --> 30:32.896
- You know he didn't mean
nothin'.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.331
- Kurt didn't do shit.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.600
I did it, he's an asshole.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.136
He comes in here every
payday, harasses us.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.538
Half the time he's sneaking
into the dressing rooms.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.774
I have had just enough, Spider.

30:43.776 --> 30:46.243
- So you've had enough of this?

30:46.245 --> 30:47.811
Well the door's that way,

30:47.813 --> 30:51.448
don't let it hit you in your
ass, baby.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.050
- Are you serious?

30:53.052 --> 30:54.818
- Hey, it's Spider, isn't it?

30:54.820 --> 30:56.920
- And who in the hell are you?

30:56.922 --> 30:58.288
- I've been coming
here for years.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.190
I love the dames, love the eats.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.426
Best Italian steak in the state,

31:02.428 --> 31:04.595
but Bambi here didn't do the
damage.

31:04.597 --> 31:05.429
I did it.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.197
- So you did this?

31:08.701 --> 31:11.001
Well I don't give two
shits who did this.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.337
This is bullshit.

31:13.339 --> 31:18.008
Get these fuckers out of here
and somebody get their ass

31:18.010 --> 31:21.378
on this bar and
start jiggling it.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.113
- Screw you, Spider.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.349
I need to get my stuff.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.385
You, you need to get a backbone.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.725
- I'm really sorry, man.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.293
You know, that fucker's my
brother-in-law

31:36.295 --> 31:37.661
and this is my only gig.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.230
And two strikes now,
you know how it is, man.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.135
I'm sorry.

31:45.136 --> 31:46.235
- Hey, thanks for what
you did in there.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.671
- Oh, hell, little lady.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.740
Hey, you had some pretty
good moves of your own.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.074
Me and Elvis here, we just
stopped in

31:51.076 --> 31:52.109
for some eats and then,

31:52.111 --> 31:54.177
then that asshole started in.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.345
- Well, I appreciate it.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.647
And I'm sorry you guys didn't
get dinner,

31:56.649 --> 31:58.649
but there is a diner
about two blocks down.

31:58.651 --> 32:01.118
- Well, hell, darling,
why don't you join us.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.387
If I'm not being
too forward, that is.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.088
- Actually, I am kinda hungry.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.290
Do you mind taking
me home after?

32:06.292 --> 32:09.726
- Well as long as Mr. Bambi
ain't gonna blow his lid.

32:09.728 --> 32:13.497
- Well, keep your lid on
daddio, there is no Mr. Bambi.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.198
- All the better, sweetie.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.834
(upbeat music)

32:36.855 --> 32:38.021
(dramatic music)

32:38.023 --> 32:39.589
- Hey, you need a ride?

32:39.591 --> 32:42.392
(dramatic music)

33:06.518 --> 33:10.654
- Yes, I have power like
none you have ever seen.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.325
Even stronger than Godzilla.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.394
We barbecue their asses.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.931
(tapping)

33:28.807 --> 33:31.541
(phone beeping)

33:35.280 --> 33:38.482
(crickets chirping)

33:38.484 --> 33:41.818
- This is Autumn, look hey,
when you get this message,

33:41.820 --> 33:44.721
I need you to send some
of the boys over here.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.323
I think those town motherfuckers

33:46.325 --> 33:47.791
are here again, messing around.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.026
(dramatic music)
I'm gonna--

33:49.028 --> 33:50.394
- You're not gonna need that.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.096
(Autumn gasping)
I'm the only lie

33:52.097 --> 33:53.797
you're gonna need.
(Ronnie cackling)

33:53.799 --> 33:57.901
And good news, I brought some
of the boys along with me.

33:57.903 --> 34:00.871
(Ronnie chuckling)

34:10.849 --> 34:12.949
- What the fuck is
wrong with you?

34:12.951 --> 34:17.154
- Well now, Autumn, you should
know what's wrong with us.

34:17.156 --> 34:22.225
You made us this way
and it's all your fault.

34:22.628 --> 34:26.830
If you'da just kept that nose
of yours out of my business,

34:26.832 --> 34:28.899
none of this would be
happening right now.

34:28.901 --> 34:33.970
And now we're here to make
sure you never do that again.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.740
(dramatic music)
(Ronnie cackling)

34:36.742 --> 34:39.076
- Such a pretty face.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.610
I think I'll take it with me.

34:41.847 --> 34:42.679
- Look, I'm sorry.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.714
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie, Ron,

34:44.716 --> 34:46.583
I promise I'll stay
out of your business.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.419
I won't be in it anymore,
just please let me go.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.855
Please stop, stop please.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.457
- Can we shut that mug up?

34:53.459 --> 34:54.524
Come on, she's wailing

34:54.526 --> 34:55.859
like a frickin' police
- Oh fuck, I'm sorry.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.561
- siren over there.
- Ronnie, wait, I'm sorry.

34:57.563 --> 34:58.595
- Come on, do something.
- You're right,

34:58.597 --> 34:59.896
I should stay outta your--

34:59.898 --> 35:01.431
(Autumn screaming)

35:01.433 --> 35:04.201
(dramatic music)
(blood splattering)

35:04.203 --> 35:07.204
(clowns chuckling)

35:08.140 --> 35:11.041
(flesh squishing)

35:31.530 --> 35:34.164
(soft music)

35:34.166 --> 35:37.501
- So I left his cheating ass
and I went back to school.

35:37.503 --> 35:40.170
And of course,
school is very expensive.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.305
So, I tried to waitress a while.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.141
This very diner, to be exact.

35:45.010 --> 35:48.678
The tips were shitty and the
hourly is just insulting.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.347
If I was gonna make
it on my own.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.616
I was gonna have to
figure out something fast.

35:52.618 --> 35:55.252
So, I gave it a try, that's all.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.521
- Well, one thing's for sure,
you got the looks for it,

35:57.523 --> 36:00.657
and the moves to match
from I caught of that show.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.326
Man, I'm sure sorry
that had to happen.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.594
- So what you gonna do now?

36:04.596 --> 36:05.695
- Not sure.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.764
Hasn't really hit me yet.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.600
But when it does, I'll
probably have a good cry,

36:10.602 --> 36:12.702
and figure out the
best way I can.

36:12.704 --> 36:16.473
One thing about me,
baby, I'm a survivor.

36:16.475 --> 36:19.109
(bell dinging)

36:19.978 --> 36:22.045
- I'm so sorry, but
there's a creep out there

36:22.047 --> 36:25.015
and he's been following me for
miles and he tried to give me

36:25.017 --> 36:27.584
a ride and I told him no,
and he just keeps showing up.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.085
- You gotta be a freak to follow

36:29.087 --> 36:30.687
a little girl around like that.

36:32.624 --> 36:33.890
- Is that the guy?

36:34.893 --> 36:37.093
- Yeah, real creep.

36:37.095 --> 36:39.329
- Hey, y'all doin'?
- You've been wonderful.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.964
- Well, good.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.666
Okay, there you go.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.734
Order'll be up in just a sec.

36:44.736 --> 36:48.872
(people talking over each other)

36:57.282 --> 37:01.218
(light dramatic music)

37:01.220 --> 37:02.252
You okay, hun?

37:02.254 --> 37:03.887
You seen a little nervous or
something.

37:03.889 --> 37:04.854
- Yeah, I'm good.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.273
Thank you.

37:06.274 --> 37:07.691
- Haven't seen you
around here before.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.626
- Nobody's from around here.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.761
Isn't everyone just
passing through?

37:11.763 --> 37:13.630
- Well, you may
be right about that.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.066
- I'd take that check
when you have the chance.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.736
- Hey, buddy.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.738
Let's have a little chat.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.540
From where I see it,
you world's nothing

37:23.542 --> 37:25.175
but bad intentions, man.

37:25.177 --> 37:27.577
The way you're eyeballing
that young girl over there.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.878
- Look, man.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.046
I don't want any trouble.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.848
I just wanna get a cup of
freakin' coffee

37:31.850 --> 37:33.917
and play on my phone a bit.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.352
- Oh, is that so?

37:35.354 --> 37:38.788
Well that little lady over there
is pretty shaken up by you.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.391
Says you've been bugging
her, following her around.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.427
Why would she go and
lie on you like that?

37:46.632 --> 37:47.530
All right, pal.

37:47.532 --> 37:48.965
How about I buy you a beer.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.166
- Alcohol is bad news, man.

37:50.168 --> 37:53.470
It weakens the character,
fuzzes the brain.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.772
It makes you soft.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.674
I've been down that road before.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.176
It's full of nothing but
broken promises and pain.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.746
Hurting everyone that you
ever gave a damn about.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.114
No thanks, man.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.448
Keep your beer.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.350
- Oh, is that so?

38:07.352 --> 38:10.153
Well, it's moving time
around here, buddy,

38:10.155 --> 38:12.355
and I think you
should catch the fever.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.356
Get movin'.

38:14.259 --> 38:16.559
(thudding)

38:20.098 --> 38:21.097
Problem solved.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.772
(car door slamming)

38:31.410 --> 38:34.744
(light dramatic music)

38:46.325 --> 38:49.392
- So is the bus usually
on time around here?

38:49.394 --> 38:50.827
- Hell, honey,
I haven't taken a bus

38:50.829 --> 38:52.862
since I had pigtails
and poodle skirts.

38:57.069 --> 39:00.303
(wind whistling)

39:00.305 --> 39:02.238
(thunder booming)

39:02.240 --> 39:03.306
- Fucking wonderful.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.975
(zapping)

39:05.977 --> 39:07.811
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

39:07.813 --> 39:09.245
(people talking over each other)

39:09.247 --> 39:10.880
- What the hell is going on?

39:10.882 --> 39:12.515
- [Woman] We never know.

39:12.517 --> 39:15.418
(thunder booming)

39:21.860 --> 39:25.261
- You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

39:25.263 --> 39:30.100
(dramatic music)
(wind whistling)

39:30.102 --> 39:32.869
Screw driver, crowbar,
hammer, anything.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.371
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

39:36.308 --> 39:38.508
(zapping)

39:41.980 --> 39:44.814
(dramatic music)

39:45.717 --> 39:49.753
(clowns chuckling)
(muffled talking)

39:49.755 --> 39:52.655
(Ronnie growling)

39:53.992 --> 39:55.959
- You know this clown, honey?

39:55.961 --> 39:57.093
- You could say that.

39:58.296 --> 40:03.366
(thunder booming)
(pounding)

40:05.303 --> 40:07.937
Hey, Flo, you got
the keys to that door?

40:07.939 --> 40:10.807
- Under the counter over
there, and the name's Alice.

40:10.809 --> 40:11.941
- Of course it is.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.176
Let's go with those
keys sweetie.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.612
You don't want these
fuckers in here, trust me.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.114
(pounding on door)

40:18.116 --> 40:19.382
(Ronnie chuckling)

40:19.384 --> 40:20.483
Get the fucking keys.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.896
- [Hunter] Come on.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.237
Yeah.

40:41.239 --> 40:44.073
(dramatic music)

40:46.077 --> 40:47.677
(clowns laughing)

40:47.679 --> 40:49.679
- Get in the back, all of you.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.948
Get in the back now, move.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.350
Move, move!
(Ronnie chuckling)

40:54.352 --> 40:55.819
Look for a phone.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.955
- Damn, I got nothing.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.090
- Yeah, nothing here either.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.026
Maybe the storm?

41:03.027 --> 41:04.961
- Well, my black ass doesn't
feel safe at all right now.

41:06.031 --> 41:09.132
(Ronnie cackling)

41:09.134 --> 41:10.767
- Look, honey, if you know
what's going on with these

41:10.769 --> 41:12.836
painted freaks, you need
to let us know pronto.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.537
- It's a long story, honey,

41:14.539 --> 41:16.506
and this ain't the
time or place.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.875
All you need to know is
is that they are some evil

41:18.877 --> 41:21.678
motherfuckers who do some
sick sadistic shit to people.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.980
As in, we need to find a
phone that fucking works

41:23.982 --> 41:26.649
and some cops and do it quick.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.351
- I got it.

41:28.353 --> 41:31.421
(suspenseful music)

41:37.596 --> 41:40.330
(phone beeping)

41:41.600 --> 41:43.833
(moaning)

41:49.975 --> 41:51.441
Cell phone.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.910
Cell phone, cell phone, okay.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.916
(dramatic music)
(groaning)

41:59.918 --> 42:04.988
(flesh squishing)
(neck snapping)

42:06.958 --> 42:09.826
- Oh shit, where the
fuck did they go?

42:09.828 --> 42:10.660
(dramatic music)

42:10.662 --> 42:12.395
- [Dion] Maybe they gave up.

42:12.397 --> 42:13.730
- No, something
tells me that ain't

42:13.732 --> 42:15.031
the case with these clowns.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.766
Am I right, darling?

42:16.768 --> 42:18.701
- You have no idea, Billy Jack.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.405
- Shit, who's got the keys?

42:22.407 --> 42:23.806
- Flo's got 'em.

42:23.808 --> 42:26.309
- My name's not Flo, bitch.

42:26.311 --> 42:29.045
(keys jingling)

42:30.715 --> 42:32.382
- Come on, come on.

42:32.384 --> 42:33.416
(dramatic music)
Fuck.

42:33.418 --> 42:35.652
(people talking over each other)

42:35.654 --> 42:37.620
(screaming)

42:37.622 --> 42:39.455
- Everybody.
- Stay back, stay back.

42:39.457 --> 42:40.657
Stay back, stay.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.759
(thudding)
(blood squishing)

42:42.761 --> 42:45.361
- [Woman] Oh my God,
what are you doing?

42:45.363 --> 42:48.097
(woman screaming)

42:48.099 --> 42:50.800
(muffled talking)

42:50.802 --> 42:53.670
(crunching)

42:53.672 --> 42:56.406
- She's fucking dead!
- Oh, shit!

42:57.909 --> 42:58.775
- Get down.
- Oh, my God.

42:58.777 --> 43:00.977
- Get down.
- Come on, move!

43:00.979 --> 43:01.878
- Okay.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.782
(clown chuckling)

43:05.784 --> 43:09.986
- [Rachel] It's not a big
apartment, let's escape.

43:15.126 --> 43:20.196
(chef groaning)
(flesh squishing)

43:22.233 --> 43:24.300
- Almost got it.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.069
- [Man] Fucking bitches.

43:26.070 --> 43:27.837
- [Savanna] Why don't you
open the fucking door?

43:27.839 --> 43:30.740
(flesh squishing)

43:36.214 --> 43:40.049
(people yelling over each other)

43:40.051 --> 43:45.121
- Fuck, fuck!
(groaning)

43:50.295 --> 43:52.895
- Lock the basement!
- God dammit, it's jammed.

43:52.897 --> 43:54.964
- [Man] You fucking bitches.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.866
- You think you're a
man, I'll tell you that.

43:56.868 --> 43:58.668
(blood squishing)

43:58.670 --> 44:00.703
We need to go out
the door you guys.

44:00.705 --> 44:03.673
Come on, give him
some fucking room.

44:03.675 --> 44:04.607
- I got it.

44:04.609 --> 44:09.646
(upbeat music)
(people screaming)

44:11.750 --> 44:15.585
(dramatic music)
(Savanna gasping)

44:15.587 --> 44:18.921
- [Man] Bitches,
I'll fucking kill you!

44:19.891 --> 44:21.758
(suspenseful music)

44:21.760 --> 44:23.493
(woman screaming)

44:23.495 --> 44:24.861
(clown chuckling)

44:24.863 --> 44:29.098

(flesh squishing)

44:29.100 --> 44:32.168
(clown cackling)

44:32.170 --> 44:34.570
(dramatic music)
(people screaming)

44:34.572 --> 44:35.471
- Fuck.

44:36.341 --> 44:37.173
Fuck.

44:37.175 --> 44:40.009
Fuck, Rachel.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.210
(Rachel screaming)

44:41.212 --> 44:43.813
Come here you motherfucker,
you let her go.

44:43.815 --> 44:47.083
- He got 'em off of me.
(thudding)

44:47.085 --> 44:50.253
(clown gasping)
(foot thudding)

44:50.255 --> 44:52.655
- [Rachel] Come on.

44:52.657 --> 44:55.491
(fists thudding)

45:05.203 --> 45:07.470
- Come on, bro, come on.
- No.

45:07.472 --> 45:10.406
- [Dion] Let's go.

45:10.407 --> 45:13.341
(Satchel cackling)
(flesh squishing)

45:19.484 --> 45:21.350
(blood squirting)

45:21.352 --> 45:22.819
- Get off of me.

45:22.821 --> 45:24.053
Get off of me!

45:25.390 --> 45:27.223
- Everything's gonna
be okay, Flo.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.392
(clown cackling)

45:29.394 --> 45:32.061
- My name's not Flo, bitch!

45:32.063 --> 45:33.429
- Make a wish.

45:34.365 --> 45:39.435
- No, no, no!
(clowns giggling)

45:43.842 --> 45:46.642
(Alice groaning)

45:53.952 --> 45:55.384
(thudding)
- No, no!

45:55.386 --> 45:56.986
- Hello, darling.

45:56.988 --> 46:01.357
So, you thought you'd
step out on me, huh?

46:01.359 --> 46:03.059
Well, here we are.

46:04.028 --> 46:06.195
Face to face again.

46:06.197 --> 46:08.030
- Please, no, please.

46:09.334 --> 46:10.933
- Wanna play doctor?

46:12.403 --> 46:14.303
- Deja fucking vu.

46:14.305 --> 46:15.972
Haven't we done this before?

46:16.908 --> 46:17.807
Ronnie, I'm sorry I--

46:19.577 --> 46:23.379
- Save it, you're a cheap
dime store version of a lady.

46:23.381 --> 46:28.451
I'm gonna open you up
and I'm gonna operate.

46:28.586 --> 46:31.854
I'm just afraid of what I
might find inside there.

46:31.856 --> 46:36.425
Maybe a block of ice where
your heart oughta be.

46:36.427 --> 46:39.529
(Ronnie laughing)

46:39.531 --> 46:42.365
(Ronnie moaning)

46:46.371 --> 46:48.805
(flesh squishing)

46:48.807 --> 46:51.774
(Savanna coughing)

47:09.294 --> 47:11.227
(Ronnie chuckling)

47:11.229 --> 47:14.063
(dramatic music)

47:24.909 --> 47:27.643
Well, maybe you do have a heart.

47:38.723 --> 47:43.793
Yeah, oh yeah.

47:43.962 --> 47:49.031
(Ronnie yelling)
(electric zapping)

47:52.070 --> 47:54.437
(dramatic music)
(squishing)

47:54.439 --> 47:57.006
- Ooh, crumb cake, my favorite.

47:57.008 --> 47:58.841
I think I'll take a slice.

47:58.843 --> 48:03.913
(man groaning)
(blood splattering)

48:10.755 --> 48:13.823
(suspenseful music)

48:15.727 --> 48:18.394
(man groaning)

48:20.598 --> 48:23.332
(flesh ripping)

48:24.502 --> 48:26.936
- Hey, Elvis, see what's
in the truck for a weapon.

48:26.938 --> 48:27.837
- You got it.

48:29.574 --> 48:34.644
- Hi.
(clown cackling)

48:36.214 --> 48:39.482
(clown giggling)

48:39.484 --> 48:42.385
(flesh squishing)

48:51.095 --> 48:53.596
- There ain't shit up I this
truck.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.364
- Hey you, do you
wanna save your ass?

48:55.366 --> 48:56.399
Come with us.

48:57.368 --> 48:58.267
- Boo.

49:00.872 --> 49:02.238
- [Nicholas] Rachel, fuck!

49:04.475 --> 49:06.309
- Look at my perfect titties.

49:06.311 --> 49:08.077
They're all natural,
motherfucker.

49:09.180 --> 49:12.081
(flesh squishing)

49:17.956 --> 49:21.023
(blood splattering)

49:29.100 --> 49:30.900
- He tried to help us.

49:30.902 --> 49:32.568
- Yo, Hunter, get everyone in
the truck.

49:32.570 --> 49:34.971
- You don't have to
tell me twice, let's go.

49:34.973 --> 49:36.806
(woman screaming)

49:36.808 --> 49:39.308
(people talking over each other)

49:39.310 --> 49:42.111
(dramatic music)

49:43.481 --> 49:46.549
- [Satchel] It's gonna
be so much fun.

49:46.551 --> 49:47.450
- Oh, that's new.

49:47.452 --> 49:51.253
I know a strip club down the
road that needs some dancers.

49:56.427 --> 49:58.761
(thudding)

50:03.101 --> 50:04.767
(squishing)

50:04.769 --> 50:06.369
- Pull it, how the fuck?

50:06.371 --> 50:07.770
Come on.

50:07.772 --> 50:09.005
Yeah.

50:09.007 --> 50:11.407
Eat up on that motherfucker.

50:12.677 --> 50:16.412
(Nicolas groaning)
Aw, shit.

50:21.319 --> 50:22.318
- Oh, fuck.

50:24.589 --> 50:27.857
(car door slamming)

50:27.859 --> 50:30.126
- Elvis, get your black ass in
the truck.

50:31.496 --> 50:34.730
(car engine rumbling)

50:38.603 --> 50:43.672
(saw grinding)
(flesh squishing)

50:57.288 --> 51:00.589
- Ooh, a new play thing.

51:05.830 --> 51:09.231
(clowns chuckling)

51:09.233 --> 51:12.034
(dramatic music)

51:12.870 --> 51:15.438
- Operation was a success.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.906
I love the makeover.

51:16.908 --> 51:19.642
(Ronnie cackling)

51:19.644 --> 51:22.545
(Satchel moaning)

51:30.221 --> 51:33.756
(thunder booming)
(intense dramatic music)

51:33.758 --> 51:35.858
- Great, another storm.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.626
It's blowing us all
over the road.

51:41.432 --> 51:43.866
- He needs a hospital,
Hunter, and quick.

51:43.868 --> 51:46.435
- I'm not supposed to say
anything,

51:46.437 --> 51:48.437
but I might be fucking dying
here, so.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.874
I'm not some random
stalker, you know.

51:51.876 --> 51:53.509
- You need to save your energy.

51:53.511 --> 51:54.777
We're gonna get you to a
hospital.

51:54.779 --> 51:56.412
- Fuck it.

51:56.414 --> 51:57.580
I gotta get this out.

51:58.349 --> 51:59.582
- I'm not a priest, baby.

51:59.584 --> 52:01.951
I don't wanna hear your last
confessions.

52:01.953 --> 52:03.018
- I'm her real father.

52:03.020 --> 52:04.520
- What the fuck did you just
say?

52:04.522 --> 52:05.988
- My name is Nicholas Stone.

52:06.991 --> 52:11.627
Your mom's name is, well
it was Theresa Stone.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.796
I fucked it all up.

52:14.932 --> 52:17.733
And I cheated on your mom
with her best fucking friend

52:17.735 --> 52:20.236
when you were just 10
feet away in the crib.

52:21.172 --> 52:24.807
Your mom was a waitress,
I didn't even have a job.

52:24.809 --> 52:26.642
I did that shit.

52:26.644 --> 52:29.044
Your mom threw my ass out to the
curb

52:29.046 --> 52:31.180
and she told me never
to fucking come back.

52:31.182 --> 52:33.015
- You never even tried
to see me until now?

52:33.017 --> 52:35.417
Having a midlife crisis or
something?

52:35.419 --> 52:36.619
- Because I'm not fucking lying

52:36.621 --> 52:38.888
and I refuse to die without
telling you.

52:38.890 --> 52:40.656
- What the fuck?

52:40.658 --> 52:42.725
Okay, great timing there,
poncho.

52:42.727 --> 52:45.261
- Yeah, I always had impeccable
timing.

52:46.264 --> 52:48.297
- We'll get you taken
care of, just hang on.

52:48.299 --> 52:53.369
(dramatic music)
(thunder booming)

52:55.840 --> 52:58.307
- Shit, it's still coming.

52:58.309 --> 52:59.542
- That fucking tornado just
touched down

52:59.544 --> 53:02.511
in the parking lot and these
clowns just came out of it.

53:02.513 --> 53:03.913
- After what I've already seen,

53:03.915 --> 53:06.348
I'll pretty much believe
anything at this point.

53:18.062 --> 53:21.297
(car engine rumbling)

53:28.606 --> 53:30.940
Dude, what's the plan?

53:30.942 --> 53:33.909
(thunder booming)

53:33.911 --> 53:36.712
(carnival music)

53:38.749 --> 53:40.049
- We're all gonna die in here.

53:40.051 --> 53:42.651
- That's enough of that, little
lady.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.119
We're gonna make it.

53:44.121 --> 53:46.388
(dramatic music)

53:46.390 --> 53:48.457
The bastards are gone.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.995
(thudding)
(screaming)

53:52.997 --> 53:55.965
(tires screeching)

54:13.417 --> 54:15.084
- Where is it?

54:15.086 --> 54:16.151
Where is it?

54:17.455 --> 54:20.289
- Fuck, Hunter, shake
that mofo off the roof.

54:21.225 --> 54:22.191
- I'm tryin'.

54:23.661 --> 54:26.528
(thunder booming)

54:26.530 --> 54:29.431
(Ronnie laughing)

54:35.673 --> 54:39.141
I can't shake the ugly son of a
bitch.

54:39.143 --> 54:40.476
Fuck this freak show.

54:42.947 --> 54:43.846
- No way, man.

54:43.848 --> 54:45.648
No way you're opening that door.

54:45.650 --> 54:47.483
- You can't get him off the
truck.

54:47.485 --> 54:49.451
Trust me, I can do this.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.787
- No, do not open that door, god
dammit.

54:51.789 --> 54:52.955
- Maybe you can forgive me and
think

54:52.957 --> 54:54.623
of your dad as a good guy.

54:57.361 --> 54:59.695
(groaning)

55:00.898 --> 55:01.797
Fuck!

55:07.004 --> 55:09.872
(bones cracking)

55:09.874 --> 55:11.674
(gagging)

55:15.112 --> 55:18.180
(blood splattering)

55:32.029 --> 55:34.830
(clown cackling)

55:39.870 --> 55:44.940
(dramatic music)
(Savanna gasping)

55:58.856 --> 56:01.757
(flesh squishing)

56:16.273 --> 56:19.174
(Savanna gasping)

56:21.312 --> 56:23.445
- Oh yeah, that'll do.

56:24.782 --> 56:27.116
Here I come, you sick sons of
bitches.

56:36.627 --> 56:39.628
- Grave is deep and the
night is fucking cold,

56:39.630 --> 56:42.998
and the world is a skull
for a stinking mold.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.299
Just think about it, kid.

56:45.136 --> 56:46.135
- What in the hell are you doing
out here

56:46.137 --> 56:47.569
in the middle of the night?

56:47.571 --> 56:49.538
I mean, you may have just
won the lucky kid award.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.507
You could have been clown chow.

56:51.509 --> 56:52.775
- Make a right up ahead.

56:59.984 --> 57:01.683
(tires squealing)

57:01.685 --> 57:02.518
- Damn.

57:02.520 --> 57:04.420
- [Hunter] Just great.

57:11.395 --> 57:12.828
- Hi, Sheriff.

57:12.830 --> 57:14.263
What's going on?

57:14.265 --> 57:15.697
- Oh hey there, Bambi.

57:17.001 --> 57:19.168
Did you hear what
happened over at the club?

57:19.170 --> 57:21.370
- I got fired, so
thankfully I wasn't there.

57:21.372 --> 57:22.471
- Fired?

57:22.473 --> 57:25.808
Well who in their right
minds would fire you?

57:25.810 --> 57:28.243
Hell, you were the only reason
to go.

57:28.245 --> 57:31.847
Them other girls, basically meth
fiends,

57:31.849 --> 57:36.185
with souls as black as
Elvis's hair over here.

57:37.087 --> 57:39.254
- Name's Dion, nice to meet you.

57:39.256 --> 57:43.425
- Damn, you have got some balls,
son.

57:43.427 --> 57:46.328
Walking around here, dressed
like that.

57:46.330 --> 57:49.264
Say, if anyone asks, you tell
'em you think it's Halloween,

57:49.266 --> 57:51.533
maybe they'll feel sorry for ya.

57:51.535 --> 57:52.701
- Uh, hey, Sheriff.

57:52.703 --> 57:54.736
We're just trying to the lady
home.

57:54.738 --> 57:56.705
It's been a hell of a night,

57:56.707 --> 57:59.041
and she's go a kid at home
freakin' out.

57:59.043 --> 58:00.709
Anyway we can get through?

58:00.711 --> 58:04.580
- Well I'm guessing you haven't
seen a TV or heard a radio.

58:04.582 --> 58:08.217
There is one nasty ass
storm heading this way.

58:08.219 --> 58:11.353
Tornado touched down
about four blocks away.

58:11.355 --> 58:13.589
The debris from the houses and
stuff

58:13.591 --> 58:16.091
is blocking the road up ahead.

58:16.093 --> 58:17.693
- Ah, shit, Sheriff.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.728
Look, we've already had
a run in with this storm,

58:19.730 --> 58:21.430
like three times tonight.

58:21.432 --> 58:23.799
Fucker almost ran us
right off the highway.

58:23.801 --> 58:26.101
But it's what's inside storm.

58:26.103 --> 58:27.135
I know you're not gonna believe
me,

58:27.137 --> 58:28.937
but there are these things.

58:28.939 --> 58:32.174
There are these, (chuckling),
fuck it.

58:32.977 --> 58:34.510
- What's your name again?

58:34.512 --> 58:37.479
- It's Doghouse Riley.

58:37.481 --> 58:40.082
- You been drinking Doghouse?

58:40.084 --> 58:41.016
Don't be a clown.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.384
You think this is the right time

58:42.386 --> 58:44.386
to be breaking my balls out
here?

58:45.422 --> 58:47.289
I'm not sure I like your game.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.824
- My days of drinking my lunch

58:48.826 --> 58:51.393
out of a bottle have
been over for years, man.

58:51.395 --> 58:55.497
This storm is nastier than a
$2 hooker on dollar Thursdays.

58:55.499 --> 58:57.499
This tornado's got me scared
man,

58:57.501 --> 59:00.035
and not for myself, but for this
town.

59:00.037 --> 59:02.571
This blink and you'll miss it
wonder.

59:02.573 --> 59:04.506
I'm just trying to help out,
okay?

59:04.508 --> 59:05.974
- You done?

59:05.976 --> 59:10.045
Damn, all right, fair enough.

59:10.047 --> 59:12.614
I guess I'm a little on edge
tonight.

59:12.616 --> 59:14.416
Lot of good folks lost their
homes

59:14.418 --> 59:16.418
to that twisted sons of bitch.

59:24.995 --> 59:28.430
Chris, what the hell are you
and Molly doing back here?

59:28.432 --> 59:31.266
- Sorry, Sheriff, we go
where the storm takes us.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.201
This thing is intense.

59:33.203 --> 59:34.970
- You haven't seen Rusty
come by here yet, have you?

59:34.972 --> 59:39.274
- No, maybe he had better
sense than you two.

59:39.276 --> 59:41.577
- Hey, maybe you guys should
listen to the Sheriff.

59:41.579 --> 59:43.345
This thing is bad news.

59:43.347 --> 59:45.314
I mean, it's evil.

59:45.316 --> 59:47.215
- Thanks for your concern there
Billy Bob,

59:47.217 --> 59:49.084
but this ain't our first rodeo.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.385
We got this.

59:50.387 --> 59:52.487
- Hey, the name's Hunter and
little lady,

59:52.489 --> 59:53.789
you ain't got shit.

59:53.791 --> 59:55.557
If you go anywhere near that
fucking thing

59:55.559 --> 59:57.759
and you can kiss your smart ass
goodbye.

59:59.830 --> 1:00:01.463
(thunder booming)

1:00:01.465 --> 1:00:04.032
- Ah, hell, this does not look
good.

1:00:06.637 --> 1:00:08.403
This shit is getting crazy.

1:00:08.405 --> 1:00:11.006
You all need to head out.

1:00:11.008 --> 1:00:13.976
And you need to get home
to that girl of yours.

1:00:13.978 --> 1:00:18.914
Oh, and uh, Doghouse, you be
safe too.

1:00:18.916 --> 1:00:21.984
(thunder booming)

1:00:21.986 --> 1:00:24.553
- See, I told you that
shit was gonna turn around.

1:00:26.824 --> 1:00:28.890
(lightning zapping)
(screaming)

1:00:28.892 --> 1:00:29.791
Rachel!

1:00:30.928 --> 1:00:31.760
Rachel.

1:00:31.762 --> 1:00:33.662
Oh, you're all right.

1:00:33.664 --> 1:00:34.830
Are you okay?

1:00:34.832 --> 1:00:35.998
- Yeah.

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.499
- Something's burning, man.

1:00:37.501 --> 1:00:39.334
- Well thank you, Captain
Obvious.

1:00:41.005 --> 1:00:42.337
Fucking wonderful.

1:00:43.207 --> 1:00:45.440
- Shit's dead, man.

1:00:45.442 --> 1:00:47.009
- Dion, really?

1:00:47.011 --> 1:00:48.777
- I know, Captain Obvious,
right?

1:00:48.779 --> 1:00:50.812
- I'm just trying to be a good
Samaritan,

1:00:50.814 --> 1:00:52.748
and this shit happens.

1:00:52.750 --> 1:00:53.982
Nearest garage?

1:00:53.984 --> 1:00:56.618
- Did you hear me, shit for
brains?

1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:58.854
I don't have time to get a
deputy here.

1:00:58.856 --> 1:01:01.289
You are my backup.

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:03.792
Now I am telling you, not
asking,

1:01:03.794 --> 1:01:06.862
get these people outta
here and to a safe place.

1:01:06.864 --> 1:01:08.130
Do you hear me?

1:01:08.132 --> 1:01:09.398
- Well what about you?

1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:10.666
Sheriff, you can't stay here,

1:01:10.668 --> 1:01:12.300
that shitstorm is coming this
way.

1:01:12.302 --> 1:01:15.170
- I'm gettin' my ass on the
road and alerting everyone--

1:01:15.172 --> 1:01:18.774
(whistling)
(thunder booming)

1:01:18.776 --> 1:01:21.109
- [Hunter] Come on.

1:01:21.111 --> 1:01:22.444
Hey, come here.

1:01:24.114 --> 1:01:28.617
- [Bambi] You got room for me?.

1:01:28.619 --> 1:01:30.686
- All right, go, go, go.

1:01:35.893 --> 1:01:37.292
Son of a bitch, you clowns.

1:01:38.562 --> 1:01:41.463
(clowns cackling)

1:01:43.133 --> 1:01:45.767
(swanky music)

1:02:00.384 --> 1:02:02.084
- Well hello, nurse.

1:02:02.086 --> 1:02:03.852
Where have you been hiding,
honey?

1:02:10.594 --> 1:02:11.893
You okay, honey?

1:02:11.895 --> 1:02:13.695
I know the circus is in town.

1:02:21.105 --> 1:02:24.673
(groaning)
(dramatic music)

1:02:24.675 --> 1:02:26.475
Bitch, what the fuck?

1:02:27.377 --> 1:02:28.443
Shit!
(Savanna laughing)

1:02:28.445 --> 1:02:29.277
(woman gasping)

1:02:29.279 --> 1:02:34.349
(blood squishing)
(woman groaning)

1:02:37.721 --> 1:02:39.755
- Fuckin' die already!

1:02:40.791 --> 1:02:43.658
(thunder booming)

1:02:47.264 --> 1:02:51.600
- This little piggy went to
hell.

1:02:52.536 --> 1:02:54.503
(Ronnie cackling)

1:02:54.505 --> 1:02:55.403
Oh, yeah.

1:02:57.741 --> 1:03:00.742
- I don't know where
the hell you came from.

1:03:01.578 --> 1:03:05.313
Probably the sewer, but
I suggest you all go back

1:03:05.315 --> 1:03:07.516
there before my backup arrives.

1:03:07.518 --> 1:03:10.886
- Oh, you mean these all-day
suckers?

1:03:10.888 --> 1:03:13.789
(clowns laughing)

1:03:16.426 --> 1:03:19.127
Hey, calm down kid.

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:20.996
Buy yourself an orchid.

1:03:20.998 --> 1:03:22.664
(laughing)

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:24.766
- They were so much fun.

1:03:24.768 --> 1:03:29.671
- There's only room for one
Sheriff in this town, partner.

1:03:30.607 --> 1:03:33.608
(Satchel laughing)

1:03:38.048 --> 1:03:41.082
(suspenseful music)

1:03:46.490 --> 1:03:49.624
(flesh squishing)
(Sheriff yelling)

1:03:49.626 --> 1:03:51.059
Oh, yeah!

1:03:51.061 --> 1:03:52.861
Rip that piggy apart.

1:03:54.231 --> 1:03:56.164
Oh yeah, I smell bacon.

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:57.799
Yeah, burn in hell.

1:04:02.072 --> 1:04:05.106
I'm gonna munch on his little,
(groaning).

1:04:05.108 --> 1:04:06.775
Mm, let's have bacon in the
morning.

1:04:06.777 --> 1:04:08.743
(Ronnie laughing)

1:04:08.745 --> 1:04:09.644
Yeah.

1:04:13.417 --> 1:04:16.318
(blood squishing)

1:04:33.036 --> 1:04:35.804
- We've been chasing
storms for a long time now,

1:04:35.806 --> 1:04:38.640
and we've never seen anything
like this.

1:04:38.642 --> 1:04:40.375
- Someone needs to come
out with the goods here,

1:04:40.377 --> 1:04:42.377
and you better lay it on my
fast before that screwed up

1:04:42.379 --> 1:04:44.880
twister comes back, and we're
all having this conversation

1:04:44.882 --> 1:04:47.115
from a bunch of pine boxes
down on Forrest Lawn.

1:04:47.117 --> 1:04:49.618
- Those fuckin' things they
ride around in that tornado

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:52.187
like it's a DeLorean that just
came back from the future.

1:04:52.189 --> 1:04:53.521
And when they get done,

1:04:53.523 --> 1:04:56.124
most people they meet
aren't breathing anymore.

1:04:56.126 --> 1:04:57.025
Do you get it?

1:04:57.928 --> 1:04:59.628
- Breaker one three, breaker one
three,

1:04:59.630 --> 1:05:02.464
Rusty, can you hear us, Rusty?

1:05:02.466 --> 1:05:05.634
(static buzzing)

1:05:05.636 --> 1:05:07.168
- Am I not speaking English?

1:05:07.170 --> 1:05:09.738
You people are the only way
I can home to my daughter.

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:11.239
She is probably freaking the
hell out right about now,

1:05:11.241 --> 1:05:13.208
and we are sitting here like
idiots.

1:05:13.210 --> 1:05:15.210
Check that thing while we drive.

1:05:15.212 --> 1:05:17.512
That tornado is gonna
popup any fuckin' minute.

1:05:17.514 --> 1:05:20.215
- I just wish I knew what
the hell we're dealing with.

1:05:21.084 --> 1:05:22.884
(wailing)

1:05:22.886 --> 1:05:25.186
- Oh and I guess we have to
deal with this shit again.

1:05:25.188 --> 1:05:27.055
Fuck!

1:05:27.056 --> 1:05:28.923
- Look sister, those
motherfuckers are relentless.

1:05:28.926 --> 1:05:30.125
They don't stop coming.

1:05:31.128 --> 1:05:33.962
(dramatic music)

1:05:34.831 --> 1:05:36.431
- Thanks for the ride, bitch.

1:05:40.671 --> 1:05:43.571
(thunder booming)

1:05:50.414 --> 1:05:52.614
- Chris, we need to find some
cover.

1:05:52.616 --> 1:05:53.782
That thing's getting bigger.

1:05:53.784 --> 1:05:55.617
I don't know if we're gonna out
run it.

1:05:55.619 --> 1:05:57.452
- We need to figure out
how to stop this shit.

1:05:57.454 --> 1:06:00.121
That thing's big enough to turn
this whole town upside down.

1:06:00.123 --> 1:06:02.524
- There's no way to stop
a tornado, Einstein.

1:06:02.526 --> 1:06:04.759
- Actually, there's a theory

1:06:04.761 --> 1:06:07.729
and it's been proven by some
scientists.

1:06:07.731 --> 1:06:10.832
A tornado is pretty complex,
but there has to be a perfect

1:06:10.834 --> 1:06:13.001
mix of hot and cold to
make it work, right?

1:06:13.003 --> 1:06:14.369
- I get it, Molly.

1:06:14.371 --> 1:06:16.004
A tornado needs both a cold
downdraft

1:06:16.006 --> 1:06:17.973
and a warm updraft in order to
form.

1:06:17.975 --> 1:06:19.308
If you take one of those away,

1:06:19.309 --> 1:06:20.642
then the whole thing becomes
unstable.

1:06:20.644 --> 1:06:22.310
Holy shit, I think I got an
idea.

1:06:22.312 --> 1:06:24.179
- So how did they stop a
tornado?

1:06:24.181 --> 1:06:25.146
Get to the point.

1:06:25.148 --> 1:06:29.751
- They used liquid nitrogen
to cool the whole thing down.

1:06:29.753 --> 1:06:31.519
- Liquid nitrogen?

1:06:31.521 --> 1:06:34.356
- My uncle, he owns an ice cream
shop.

1:06:34.358 --> 1:06:36.891
He uses liquid nitrogen
to make his own shit.

1:06:36.893 --> 1:06:38.360
I just need to get us there.

1:06:39.429 --> 1:06:40.729
He's got the whole rig.

1:06:40.731 --> 1:06:42.897
A vacuum storage tank, the
works.

1:06:42.899 --> 1:06:45.467
We just have to figure out
how to get it in the tornado.

1:06:45.469 --> 1:06:48.069
- Yeah, I might be able to help
you there.

1:06:48.071 --> 1:06:51.373
(dramatic music)

1:06:51.375 --> 1:06:53.742
(wind whistling)

1:06:53.744 --> 1:06:54.642
- Dammit.

1:06:58.715 --> 1:07:00.949
This is bullshit.

1:07:00.951 --> 1:07:04.652
(electric zapping)

1:07:04.654 --> 1:07:06.388
- Fuck.
(Bambi groaning)

1:07:06.390 --> 1:07:09.257
Look dude, get the fuck outta
here.

1:07:09.259 --> 1:07:12.093
(tires screeching)

1:07:12.095 --> 1:07:13.745
(horn honking)

1:07:13.746 --> 1:07:15.396
- [Chris] You've gotta
be fucking kidding me.

1:07:16.433 --> 1:07:20.201
(clown grunting)
(screaming)

1:07:20.203 --> 1:07:21.102
- Oh, God!

1:07:25.108 --> 1:07:26.941
- Get the fuck down.

1:07:26.943 --> 1:07:29.077
Now show me that smile,
buttercup.

1:07:29.913 --> 1:07:33.281
(dramatic music)

1:07:33.283 --> 1:07:35.216
Yes, these freaks can die.

1:07:35.986 --> 1:07:38.286
- I'm really glad you
knew how to use that.

1:07:41.358 --> 1:07:43.625
(squirting)

1:07:43.627 --> 1:07:46.261
- Oh, Ronnie's gonna be pissed.

1:07:49.166 --> 1:07:51.966
(dramatic music)

1:07:56.206 --> 1:07:58.940
- Well, how you doin',
doll face?

1:08:00.110 --> 1:08:02.477
(swanky music)

1:08:02.479 --> 1:08:04.312
No hard feelings, right?

1:08:05.415 --> 1:08:06.815
- From where I stand, you smell
like

1:08:06.817 --> 1:08:09.084
a pitiful excuse for a man.

1:08:09.086 --> 1:08:12.487
The stench wraps around my
throat and makes me wanna
wretch.

1:08:12.489 --> 1:08:16.524
Hard feelings, baby, I've got
the hardest.

1:08:16.526 --> 1:08:17.425
- Motherfucker.

1:08:18.295 --> 1:08:19.394
- Don't get your panties wet,

1:08:19.396 --> 1:08:21.563
sweetheart, I'm not the dancing
type.

1:08:21.565 --> 1:08:24.632
(Satchel giggling)

1:08:24.634 --> 1:08:27.535
(flesh squishing)

1:08:29.272 --> 1:08:32.173
(blood squirting)

1:08:33.176 --> 1:08:36.077
(Satchel gasping)

1:08:37.814 --> 1:08:40.148
(Satchel coughing)

1:08:40.150 --> 1:08:41.683
(Savanna groaning)

1:08:41.685 --> 1:08:44.752
(Savanna screaming)

1:08:46.356 --> 1:08:48.923
(Ronnie groaning)
(bones snapping)

1:08:48.925 --> 1:08:51.826
(clowns laughing)

1:08:52.596 --> 1:08:55.497
(Ronnie cackling)

1:08:58.268 --> 1:09:01.236
(Satchel screaming)

1:09:01.238 --> 1:09:02.804
(Satchel coughing)

1:09:02.806 --> 1:09:05.640
(clown growling)

1:09:11.081 --> 1:09:13.481
(squishing)

1:09:21.858 --> 1:09:24.792
- It's so hard to say goodbye,
Chuckles.

1:09:33.570 --> 1:09:34.936
Watch the bitch.

1:09:35.872 --> 1:09:38.606
I wanna make sure she's
really dead this time.

1:09:40.143 --> 1:09:41.910
Come on, Wizzo.

1:09:41.912 --> 1:09:44.579
There's much to do before
sunrise.

1:09:44.581 --> 1:09:45.914
Someone took one of ours.

1:09:47.884 --> 1:09:50.018
And revenge is in the air, boys.

1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:52.453
(Wizzo whimpering)

1:09:52.455 --> 1:09:55.290
(dramatic music)

1:09:58.828 --> 1:10:01.396
(suspenseful music)

1:10:01.398 --> 1:10:04.199
(Chris groaning)

1:10:05.168 --> 1:10:07.702
- Damn, too bad the phones
are still messed up.

1:10:07.704 --> 1:10:09.003
We could have made one phone
call

1:10:09.005 --> 1:10:10.838
and wouldn't have had to do any
of this.

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:13.241
- Molly, you got the goods?

1:10:18.515 --> 1:10:20.181
Cover your ears.

1:10:20.183 --> 1:10:23.051
(gunshot banging)

1:10:23.053 --> 1:10:24.586
Not so bad, come on.

1:10:26.456 --> 1:10:29.757
(light dramatic music)

1:10:44.207 --> 1:10:45.106
Hunter.

1:10:46.543 --> 1:10:48.509
I found it.

1:10:48.511 --> 1:10:50.445
Only chance we got, really.

1:10:50.447 --> 1:10:54.749
- Okay, if we're gonna do
this, we don't drop it,

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:58.152
we don't shake it, we don't
even sneeze around this thing,

1:10:58.154 --> 1:11:00.188
or they're gonna picking
up pieces of all of us

1:11:00.190 --> 1:11:02.890
all the way back to Texas, get
it?

1:11:02.892 --> 1:11:05.493
(Rachel crying)
- I'm such an asshole.

1:11:05.495 --> 1:11:09.230
I shoulda called my mom when
I had the chance and I didn't.

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:12.066
I fucked everything up.

1:11:13.069 --> 1:11:16.104
- Oh, honey, it'll be okay.

1:11:16.106 --> 1:11:17.538
- Rachel, look at me.

1:11:18.408 --> 1:11:20.341
We're gonna get you home, okay?

1:11:20.343 --> 1:11:22.143
You and Bambi both.

1:11:22.145 --> 1:11:23.378
We're gonna be okay.

1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:24.712
(thunder booming)
(Molly hushing)

1:11:24.714 --> 1:11:25.613
- Listen.

1:11:27.083 --> 1:11:27.915
(thudding)

1:11:27.917 --> 1:11:29.083
What the hell is that?

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:31.853
- Thunder, motherfucker,
thunder.

1:11:32.722 --> 1:11:35.056
- Chris, we need a cart or
something.

1:11:36.693 --> 1:11:37.592
- Will this do?

1:11:42.098 --> 1:11:44.666
(clanking)

1:11:44.668 --> 1:11:47.468
(dramatic music)

1:11:52.942 --> 1:11:57.245
(intense dramatic music)
- Oh hell.

1:12:01.318 --> 1:12:02.150
(thudding)
- Oh, Dion!

1:12:02.152 --> 1:12:04.686
(screaming)

1:12:04.688 --> 1:12:05.787
- Oh, my God.
- Dion!

1:12:05.789 --> 1:12:07.088
- Dion, Dion!
- Oh, no!

1:12:07.090 --> 1:12:08.723
(clown cackling)

1:12:08.725 --> 1:12:12.160
(gunshot banging)

1:12:12.162 --> 1:12:13.961
(light dramatic music)

1:12:13.963 --> 1:12:16.864
(Hunter groaning)

1:12:31.448 --> 1:12:36.517
(dramatic music)
(clowns laughing)

1:12:51.368 --> 1:12:53.801
(Savanna gasping)

1:12:53.803 --> 1:12:54.702
- Oh.

1:12:58.108 --> 1:13:00.208
(neck cracking)

1:13:00.210 --> 1:13:01.442
Mother fucker.

1:13:04.748 --> 1:13:07.215
(thunder booming)

1:13:07.217 --> 1:13:12.220
Ronnie, the bitch is back,
and she's comin' to get ya.

1:13:12.222 --> 1:13:15.022
(dramatic music)

1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:18.926
- [Hunter] Where the hell are
we?

1:13:18.928 --> 1:13:21.796
- My uncle's shop is
attached to an old mini-mall.

1:13:21.798 --> 1:13:23.798
- Got any gun stores?

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:25.133
- No.

1:13:25.135 --> 1:13:26.567
Fucking idiot.

1:13:26.569 --> 1:13:28.836
Using all that ammo on the
goddamn door.

1:13:28.838 --> 1:13:30.838
- Shit, it's not on you.

1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:34.909
Shit happens and today shit
happens every 42 seconds.

1:13:34.911 --> 1:13:36.878
We just gotta get this thing to
the truck.

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.212
Number one priority.

1:13:39.048 --> 1:13:40.648
- I think we can get out through
here.

1:13:53.163 --> 1:13:54.061
(elevator dinging)

1:13:54.063 --> 1:13:55.863
We need to get to the parking
garage.

1:13:55.865 --> 1:13:56.697
That's our way out.

1:13:56.699 --> 1:13:57.765
- Sounds good to me.

1:14:00.703 --> 1:14:01.602
Easy now.

1:14:10.146 --> 1:14:12.613
(dramatic music)
(screaming)

1:14:12.615 --> 1:14:14.949
- No!
- Here's Chuckles.

1:14:14.951 --> 1:14:16.617
(Chuckles giggling)

1:14:16.619 --> 1:14:17.652
- No!

1:14:17.654 --> 1:14:19.654
- Hunter, get 'em outta here.

1:14:19.656 --> 1:14:21.022
- Dion!
- TCB, baby.

1:14:22.859 --> 1:14:24.525
- Well, well, well.

1:14:25.595 --> 1:14:28.996
Elvis, I'm such a big fan.

1:14:33.036 --> 1:14:36.137
(clowns laughing)

1:14:36.139 --> 1:14:37.672
(thudding)
(squishing)

1:14:37.674 --> 1:14:40.508
(Dion screaming)

1:14:49.619 --> 1:14:54.689
(Ronnie chuckling)
(suspenseful music)

1:14:58.161 --> 1:15:00.828
Elvis has left the building.

1:15:00.830 --> 1:15:03.731
(Ronnie laughing)

1:15:09.305 --> 1:15:13.040
(suspenseful music)

1:15:13.042 --> 1:15:15.209
(thudding)

1:15:15.211 --> 1:15:16.110
- Shit.

1:15:27.390 --> 1:15:28.723
This is bullshit.

1:15:28.725 --> 1:15:29.824
Dammit.

1:15:29.826 --> 1:15:31.459
- Shit, Chris, they're coming.

1:15:31.461 --> 1:15:34.095
(creepy music)

1:15:34.964 --> 1:15:38.599
(clowns grunting)

1:15:38.601 --> 1:15:41.502
- Chris, give me a
hand with this.

1:15:45.375 --> 1:15:46.374
Yeah, good.

1:15:47.176 --> 1:15:48.042
Hey you get the rig.

1:15:48.044 --> 1:15:49.176
- [Chris] Everything I got.

1:15:49.178 --> 1:15:51.712
- Those circus freaks will
be here any minute now.

1:15:56.519 --> 1:15:57.552
- All right, slowly.
- Careful.

1:16:01.858 --> 1:16:03.791
- You're gonna have
to get in first.

1:16:03.793 --> 1:16:05.426
- All right, watch out.

1:16:07.030 --> 1:16:08.429
- Rachel, Bambi.

1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:19.740
Hey, hotshot, you wanna
take the back for cover?

1:16:19.742 --> 1:16:22.743
- Already in the plan, my
man, I'm your Huckleberry.

1:16:22.745 --> 1:16:24.145
- Damn, girl, I think I'm in
love.

1:16:24.147 --> 1:16:26.447
Another time and another place,
right?

1:16:26.449 --> 1:16:28.382
Be sure to put the grill back.

1:16:29.953 --> 1:16:31.285
(clowns chuckling)

1:16:31.287 --> 1:16:33.588
- [Wizzo] Yeah, god dammit.

1:16:42.532 --> 1:16:45.600
(suspenseful music)

1:16:47.971 --> 1:16:52.306
- I wish none of this
was happening, but it is.

1:16:53.376 --> 1:16:55.176
And we gotta stay strong.

1:16:57.313 --> 1:16:59.246
We're almost there.

1:16:59.248 --> 1:17:02.083
- [Molly] That's some real
uplifting shit, right there.

1:17:04.020 --> 1:17:05.286
(clowns laughing)

1:17:05.288 --> 1:17:06.187
- Intense.

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.024
You, hey.

1:17:11.094 --> 1:17:12.126
You're up.

1:17:12.128 --> 1:17:12.960
- No I won't.

1:17:12.962 --> 1:17:13.794
- Yeah.
- No.

1:17:13.796 --> 1:17:15.029
- Yeah, you.
- What, no.

1:17:15.031 --> 1:17:16.831
- Well I guess if you
want something done right

1:17:16.833 --> 1:17:18.132
you gotta do it yourself.

1:17:18.134 --> 1:17:20.368
(Ronnie growling)
Turn back.

1:17:20.370 --> 1:17:22.136
(rattling)

1:17:22.138 --> 1:17:24.105
Get outta here.

1:17:24.107 --> 1:17:25.172
Oh, get in here.

1:17:25.174 --> 1:17:26.741
- [Wizzo] No, let's think about
it.

1:17:26.743 --> 1:17:28.376
(grunting)

1:17:28.378 --> 1:17:30.044
Do it.

1:17:30.046 --> 1:17:32.380
(grunting)

1:17:34.083 --> 1:17:36.884
(dramatic music)

1:17:46.329 --> 1:17:47.228
- Hey, (hushes).

1:17:49.899 --> 1:17:51.932
- Oh, yeah, I smell a stripper
in here.

1:17:52.969 --> 1:17:53.934
Mm, with fishnets.

1:17:54.771 --> 1:17:58.239
(Ronnie moaning)

1:17:58.241 --> 1:18:00.107
I'll get one of them.

1:18:00.109 --> 1:18:01.942
- I thought I heard something.

1:18:01.944 --> 1:18:03.277
(suspenseful music)

1:18:03.279 --> 1:18:05.212
- You gotta get that fucker
open, man.

1:18:09.018 --> 1:18:10.584
- I smell you.

1:18:10.586 --> 1:18:13.688
(sniffing)

1:18:13.690 --> 1:18:15.322
- Look, I can't get up there.

1:18:15.324 --> 1:18:17.425
Kick the shit out of it.

1:18:17.427 --> 1:18:19.994
- Oh you gotta do something
right,

1:18:19.996 --> 1:18:22.530
you gotta do it yourself.

1:18:22.532 --> 1:18:24.699
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1:18:32.709 --> 1:18:34.642
- [Chris] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy, easy.

1:18:34.644 --> 1:18:35.543
- [Hunter] Okay.

1:18:36.479 --> 1:18:37.478
You got it?

1:18:45.655 --> 1:18:48.489
(dramatic music)

1:18:51.627 --> 1:18:54.361
(Bambi panting)

1:19:08.344 --> 1:19:10.878
(door creaking)

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:13.981
- [Chris] All right, follow me.

1:19:13.983 --> 1:19:16.317
(groaning)

1:19:20.556 --> 1:19:21.455
- Oh yeah.

1:19:23.159 --> 1:19:24.225
I smell you.

1:19:26.629 --> 1:19:27.595
I want you.

1:19:29.332 --> 1:19:30.631
(suspenseful music)

1:19:30.633 --> 1:19:33.267
I'm gonna eat a few of you too.

1:19:34.904 --> 1:19:38.239
(Ronnie grunting)

1:19:38.241 --> 1:19:41.041
(dramatic music)

1:19:44.013 --> 1:19:46.914
(Hunter groaning)

1:19:54.357 --> 1:19:55.856
(suspenseful music)

1:19:55.858 --> 1:19:58.025
- Oh, go, go, go, go, go.

1:20:09.806 --> 1:20:11.806
- Where is that fat sack of
peanuts.

1:20:11.808 --> 1:20:14.308
- I told you you shoulda
parked in the parking garage.

1:20:14.310 --> 1:20:15.576
Tornado.

1:20:15.578 --> 1:20:16.410
- Well I didn't think we were
gonna

1:20:16.412 --> 1:20:17.778
be in a fucking parking garage.

1:20:17.780 --> 1:20:21.315
Now we gotta get this big
bastard back to my fucking
truck.

1:20:21.317 --> 1:20:23.184
(dramatic music)

1:20:23.186 --> 1:20:26.854
(clown laughing)
- Oh, God!

1:20:35.832 --> 1:20:38.732
- There's the way out.

1:20:38.734 --> 1:20:40.601
- Is that little fucker still
behind us?

1:20:40.603 --> 1:20:42.670
- Yeah, he's still here.

1:20:45.041 --> 1:20:47.274
- Guess what, you're mine.

1:20:48.311 --> 1:20:50.778
- Fuck.
- Fuck your little face.

1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:53.514
(clown gagging)

1:20:56.485 --> 1:21:01.555
(women groaning)
(blood squishing)

1:21:13.502 --> 1:21:15.286
(cracking)

1:21:15.287 --> 1:21:17.071
- Oh, pop goes the weasel,
motherfucker.

1:21:17.073 --> 1:21:20.140
(blood splattering)

1:21:22.378 --> 1:21:23.577
- [Chris] Oh, shit!

1:21:23.579 --> 1:21:25.346
- [Hunter] Oh, there's
another one, let's go!

1:21:25.348 --> 1:21:28.182
(dramatic music)

1:21:50.506 --> 1:21:51.405
Go.

1:21:52.408 --> 1:21:55.309
(Ronnie laughing)

1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:00.581
(thunder booming)

1:22:02.051 --> 1:22:05.853
(Ronnie maniacally laughing)

1:22:09.992 --> 1:22:11.158
- What about my daughter?

1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:12.726
You were supposed to take me
home.

1:22:12.728 --> 1:22:13.827
- I promise you I'll get you to
her,

1:22:13.829 --> 1:22:16.430
but with that tornado out
there, nobody is safe.

1:22:16.432 --> 1:22:18.098
We have to stop that thing.

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:20.367
Hunter?

1:22:20.368 --> 1:22:22.635
- Old airport, about two
miles down, south side.

1:22:22.638 --> 1:22:24.638
- Yeah, I know where it is.

1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:27.141
- I got an old friend
there that owes me a favor.

1:22:29.045 --> 1:22:31.412
(car engine rumbling)

1:22:31.414 --> 1:22:34.214
(dramatic music)

1:22:45.895 --> 1:22:49.196
(pounding on door)

1:22:49.198 --> 1:22:50.564
- Man, are you sure he's here?

1:22:50.566 --> 1:22:51.665
- Oh, he's here.

1:22:51.667 --> 1:22:53.300
Hawk is always here.

1:22:53.302 --> 1:22:54.234
- Hawk?

1:22:54.236 --> 1:22:56.003
- Yeah, Memphis Hawk.

1:22:56.005 --> 1:22:57.371
People call him the Hurricane
'cause

1:22:57.373 --> 1:22:59.940
he flew through two of 'em.

1:22:59.942 --> 1:23:04.078
Come on.
(pounding on door)

1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:08.716
(door creaking)
(light dramatic music)

1:23:08.718 --> 1:23:09.616
Hawk?

1:23:10.987 --> 1:23:11.885
Hawk!

1:23:19.028 --> 1:23:20.494
- Whoa!
- Hey, it's me.

1:23:20.496 --> 1:23:22.963
It's Hunter, you crazy bastard.

1:23:23.833 --> 1:23:27.801
- Yeah, Hunter, I smelled you a
mile away.

1:23:27.803 --> 1:23:29.436
Sheesh.

1:23:29.438 --> 1:23:32.906
Oh, I see you met Mr. Maxwell.

1:23:32.908 --> 1:23:36.110
See, he always comes to the
front door when somebody's

1:23:36.112 --> 1:23:39.013
beatin' on it at 2:30 in the
morning.

1:23:39.015 --> 1:23:40.647
Son of a bitch.

1:23:40.649 --> 1:23:43.350
Why don't you come on in the
back, I'll heat up some coffee,

1:23:43.352 --> 1:23:45.119
and you can tell me why you're
knocking

1:23:45.121 --> 1:23:47.988
on my door at 2:30 in the
morning!

1:23:47.990 --> 1:23:49.256
- Okay, pal.

1:23:49.258 --> 1:23:51.225
Coffee sounds great.
- Yeah.

1:23:51.227 --> 1:23:53.193
(dramatic music)

1:23:53.195 --> 1:23:56.096
(muffled talking)

1:24:01.137 --> 1:24:03.303
- I was up watching the Late
Late Show.

1:24:03.305 --> 1:24:05.739
Tired of seeing some Joel
Edgerton double feature.

1:24:05.741 --> 1:24:08.108
Creepy dreams work for me.

1:24:08.110 --> 1:24:11.645
Well, uh, make yourselves at
home.

1:24:12.681 --> 1:24:14.548
Just don't get too comfortable
until

1:24:14.550 --> 1:24:17.184
I found out what in the hell's
going on.

1:24:17.186 --> 1:24:20.554
- Look, Hawk, it's been an
insane night.

1:24:20.556 --> 1:24:22.589
A real waking nightmare.

1:24:22.591 --> 1:24:24.058
I don't even know where to
begin.

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:27.127
- Well, I tell you what,
don't make it some long

1:24:27.129 --> 1:24:31.198
drawn out bedtime story,
'cause I hate bedtime stories.

1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:33.467
So just hit me with the
highlights, okay?

1:24:33.469 --> 1:24:35.436
- Okay, all right, pal.

1:24:35.438 --> 1:24:37.137
We need your plane, Hawk.

1:24:37.139 --> 1:24:39.073
You are the only guy that can do

1:24:39.075 --> 1:24:41.442
what we need to get done, okay?

1:24:41.444 --> 1:24:46.513
And, look, outside we have a
container of liquid nitrogen.

1:24:47.149 --> 1:24:51.985
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
back the truck up, Hunter.

1:24:51.987 --> 1:24:55.456
Fucking liquid nitrogen, are
you outta your fucking mind?

1:24:55.458 --> 1:24:56.890
Oh yeah, wait, don't answer
that.

1:24:56.892 --> 1:24:58.859
You got a couple screws loose
all right.

1:24:58.861 --> 1:25:02.129
- No, listen man, look
we had this crazy idea

1:25:02.131 --> 1:25:04.631
on how to stop this
really nasty tornado.

1:25:04.633 --> 1:25:06.333
- You, first of all, I don't
even wanna

1:25:06.335 --> 1:25:09.770
go around liquid nitrogen,
much less put it in my plane

1:25:09.772 --> 1:25:11.605
and fly it up into the
wild blue yonder.

1:25:11.607 --> 1:25:14.508
- A tornado is pretty fragile,
it takes the perfect mix

1:25:14.510 --> 1:25:16.977
of hot and cold to cool
the whole thing down.

1:25:16.979 --> 1:25:20.380
- I've been flying the
friendly skies for 35 years.

1:25:20.382 --> 1:25:22.216
I was in and out of
tornadoes while

1:25:22.218 --> 1:25:24.618
you were still laying
around in your diapers.

1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:25.819
So you don't need to tell me

1:25:25.821 --> 1:25:27.921
anything about tornadoes, honey.

1:25:27.923 --> 1:25:30.657
I've even been up in
two hurricanes.

1:25:30.659 --> 1:25:32.960
- There's a theory that
introducing severe cold

1:25:32.962 --> 1:25:36.630
to a tornado would weaken
it, destabilize it,

1:25:36.632 --> 1:25:38.465
basically causing it
to break apart.

1:25:38.467 --> 1:25:40.567
- Hawk, have I ever
played you for a sucker?

1:25:40.569 --> 1:25:43.036
Not once, not one time.

1:25:43.038 --> 1:25:45.072
I've always been
straight with you.

1:25:45.074 --> 1:25:49.042
All I'm asking is for
you to trust me, okay?

1:25:49.044 --> 1:25:50.777
And you owe me one.

1:25:52.214 --> 1:25:54.081
- Yeah, well that I do.

1:25:55.117 --> 1:25:56.950
See, this man here, he's pulled
my fat

1:25:56.952 --> 1:25:58.886
outta the fire more than once.

1:25:58.888 --> 1:26:02.756
In fact, last time, he even
took some buckshot for me.

1:26:02.758 --> 1:26:05.626
- You two can reminisce later,
we need to get going now.

1:26:05.628 --> 1:26:06.593
You stay in here, honey.

1:26:06.595 --> 1:26:07.661
- No, I'm not staying here.

1:26:07.663 --> 1:26:08.695
I'm coming with you.

1:26:08.697 --> 1:26:10.097
- No, it's safer in here.

1:26:10.099 --> 1:26:11.298
Less chance of you being in
danger.

1:26:11.300 --> 1:26:13.534
- I don't care, I'm coming with
you.

1:26:13.536 --> 1:26:15.353
- Enough.

1:26:15.354 --> 1:26:17.171
Look, if you wanna come,
that is your choice,

1:26:17.173 --> 1:26:20.607
but we gotta go get that
liquid nitrogen, and quick.

1:26:20.609 --> 1:26:23.477
- I got a bad feeling about
this.

1:26:23.479 --> 1:26:25.412
(thunder booming)

1:26:25.414 --> 1:26:28.715
(light dramatic music)

1:26:30.986 --> 1:26:33.153
All right, gone over my
checklist.

1:26:33.989 --> 1:26:36.023
Y'all ready to rock and roll?

1:26:36.025 --> 1:26:39.960
- Okay, Molly, can you handle
this door?

1:26:39.962 --> 1:26:42.796
And Chris, can you get
the girls some place safe?

1:26:42.798 --> 1:26:44.298
I don't know if this stuff's
gonna work.

1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:46.633
- No, fuck that, I'm going with
you.

1:26:46.635 --> 1:26:49.303
I know about this shit and
you're gonna need me up there.

1:26:49.305 --> 1:26:50.971
- Well, this is some bullshit.

1:26:50.973 --> 1:26:51.939
I'm going too.

1:26:53.008 --> 1:26:55.275
- Hunter, get the nitrogen.

1:26:56.512 --> 1:26:58.278
(dramatic music)

1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:01.114
(plane whirring)

1:27:10.226 --> 1:27:11.992
- Do you think this is even
gonna work?

1:27:11.994 --> 1:27:14.294
- That's way above my pay grade,
honey.

1:27:14.296 --> 1:27:16.830
For some reason, I think
those crazy bastards

1:27:16.832 --> 1:27:17.798
can pull it off.

1:27:19.768 --> 1:27:21.134
(thunder booming)

1:27:21.136 --> 1:27:23.971
(wind whistling)

1:27:25.708 --> 1:27:27.975
- Damn, that's one big
son of a bitch, Hunter.

1:27:27.977 --> 1:27:29.910
- Yeah, that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

1:27:29.912 --> 1:27:31.979
I've been fighting this thing
all night.

1:27:31.981 --> 1:27:33.280
My ass is worn out.

1:27:33.282 --> 1:27:35.315
- Well you better get bright
eyed and bushy tailed, Hunter,

1:27:35.317 --> 1:27:37.884
because if this plan doesn't
work, then we're outta options.

1:27:37.886 --> 1:27:39.253
That thing's gonna destroy
everyone

1:27:39.255 --> 1:27:40.587
and everything in its path.

1:27:40.589 --> 1:27:42.189
- I think it's following us,
Hunter.

1:27:42.191 --> 1:27:43.357
- What, well, that's good.

1:27:43.359 --> 1:27:44.925
That's what we want, right?

1:27:44.927 --> 1:27:46.760
- We gotta move it away from the
town.

1:27:46.762 --> 1:27:47.728
We gotta get it away from all

1:27:47.730 --> 1:27:49.463
those occupied houses down
there.

1:27:49.465 --> 1:27:51.098
We gotta save those people,
Hunter.

1:27:51.100 --> 1:27:54.101
We gotta get high enough
to drop the nitrogen.

1:27:54.103 --> 1:27:59.172
(wind whistling)
(dramatic music)

1:28:04.079 --> 1:28:06.280
It's moving faster than I
thought.

1:28:06.282 --> 1:28:07.547
You ready to pull that thing?

1:28:07.549 --> 1:28:09.049
- Yeah, just a bit closer.

1:28:12.354 --> 1:28:13.353
- It's do or die time.

1:28:13.355 --> 1:28:16.089
If we don't do it now, we're
gonna fail.

1:28:16.091 --> 1:28:18.058
We gotta do it now.

1:28:18.060 --> 1:28:20.594
- It's jammed.
- Fuck me you prick!

1:28:20.596 --> 1:28:22.296
- Fucker won't budge.

1:28:22.298 --> 1:28:23.897
Fucking serious?

1:28:23.899 --> 1:28:25.632
Hunter, help me with this thing.

1:28:25.634 --> 1:28:27.501
Please shake, you son of a
bitch.

1:28:27.503 --> 1:28:30.537
- It's gonna get a lot bumpier!

1:28:30.539 --> 1:28:31.972
I can't hold it much longer,
Hunter.

1:28:31.974 --> 1:28:33.774
It's do or die time.

1:28:34.677 --> 1:28:36.076
Now or never!

1:28:36.078 --> 1:28:37.844
- It won't fucking move!

1:28:37.846 --> 1:28:39.980
- [Hunter] A little more!

1:28:41.150 --> 1:28:42.582
- [Chris] Bombs away!

1:28:42.584 --> 1:28:47.654
(explosion booming)
(dramatic music)

1:28:49.625 --> 1:28:54.695
- [Hunter] Come on, Hawk,
get us the fuck outta here.

1:29:03.839 --> 1:29:06.306
(clowns gasping)

1:29:09.645 --> 1:29:12.446
(Ronnie yelling)

1:29:15.417 --> 1:29:17.918
Take that, shit head!

1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:19.720
- [Molly] Woo!

1:29:19.721 --> 1:29:21.521
- We're taking this bitch
home, ladies and gentlemen.

1:29:21.523 --> 1:29:22.756
Woo hoo, yeah!

1:29:23.692 --> 1:29:24.925
- That was close.

1:29:24.927 --> 1:29:27.327
Hawk, let's land this bitch.

1:29:27.329 --> 1:29:29.029
- I'm way ahead of ya, Hunter.

1:29:29.031 --> 1:29:30.764
We're headed for home.

1:29:30.765 --> 1:29:32.498
- Woo!
- We're on our way home, kids.

1:29:34.336 --> 1:29:37.304
- [Chris] Look at that
sky man, that's gorgeous.

1:29:54.323 --> 1:29:57.224
(uplifting music)

1:30:05.968 --> 1:30:07.534
- [Hunter] It's been good
seeing you again, man.

1:30:07.535 --> 1:30:09.101
- It's been great
seeing you, Hunter.

1:30:09.104 --> 1:30:10.237
Come on, come on.
- Ah, please.

1:30:10.239 --> 1:30:11.972
- Atta boy.

1:30:11.974 --> 1:30:14.040
Now Hunter, I want
you to think about this

1:30:14.042 --> 1:30:15.809
and think about it really good.

1:30:15.811 --> 1:30:18.211
The next you're out there
and you're driving through

1:30:18.213 --> 1:30:20.280
my neck of the woods
and you're like,

1:30:20.282 --> 1:30:21.715
I gotta go see my friend, Hawk.

1:30:21.717 --> 1:30:23.517
I want you to remember this,

1:30:23.519 --> 1:30:26.353
just fuckin' keep
going, all right?

1:30:26.355 --> 1:30:27.421
(Hunter laughing)

1:30:27.422 --> 1:30:28.488
- I thought we were
all gonna be clown chow

1:30:28.490 --> 1:30:29.322
there for a second there.

1:30:29.324 --> 1:30:30.424
- Yeah, me too.

1:30:30.426 --> 1:30:33.460
- Boys and girls, it's been
real.

1:30:33.462 --> 1:30:36.863
But I got bills to pay,
so I gotta skedaddle.

1:30:36.865 --> 1:30:38.865
You guys take care, all right?

1:30:38.867 --> 1:30:40.033
Adios amigos.

1:30:40.803 --> 1:30:43.103
Yo, Jimmy, where's Maxwell?
- Hunter, I think I saw

1:30:43.105 --> 1:30:44.738
some of it fall just a few
blocks away.

1:30:44.740 --> 1:30:47.941
(dramatic music)
- Great.

1:30:47.943 --> 1:30:51.278
(light dramatic music)

1:31:03.325 --> 1:31:06.460
(car doors slamming)

1:31:08.764 --> 1:31:11.398
(Hunter sighs)

1:31:12.267 --> 1:31:13.600
- Do you think they're dead?

1:31:13.602 --> 1:31:16.169
- Oh, let's hope so, sweetheart.

1:31:16.171 --> 1:31:19.139
Let's find out for sure and
then I'll take you both home.

1:31:19.141 --> 1:31:20.040
I promise.

1:31:34.456 --> 1:31:35.388
(dramatic music)

1:31:35.390 --> 1:31:37.624
(Hunter gasping)

1:31:37.626 --> 1:31:38.458
Holy shit.

1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:40.527
- That's enough of him.

1:31:40.529 --> 1:31:45.232
(suspenseful music)
(tires squealing)

1:31:45.234 --> 1:31:48.034
(dramatic music)

1:31:49.338 --> 1:31:51.104
(Ronnie cackling)

1:31:51.106 --> 1:31:53.607
- Ah, you gotta be fucking
kidding me.

1:31:53.609 --> 1:31:56.343
(western music)

1:32:02.217 --> 1:32:04.484
(gunshots banging)

1:32:04.486 --> 1:32:06.386
All right, go, go, go.

1:32:07.856 --> 1:32:11.124
- That's what I always
loved about you, baby.

1:32:11.126 --> 1:32:15.095
You're just like a
walking stick of dynamite.

1:32:15.097 --> 1:32:20.166
Smooth on the outside and baby,

1:32:20.168 --> 1:32:24.538
when you off, you sure
make one hell of a mess.

1:32:24.540 --> 1:32:27.440
(Ronnie cackling)

1:32:28.944 --> 1:32:34.014
- Ronnie, baby, I leave a
taste like blood in your mouth,

1:32:34.416 --> 1:32:38.184
and I will destroy you in the
most beautiful way possible.

1:32:38.186 --> 1:32:39.953
And once I'm finished,
you'll understand why

1:32:39.955 --> 1:32:41.688
storms are named after people.

1:32:43.058 --> 1:32:45.258
We're on a joyride
to hell, you and me.

1:32:47.930 --> 1:32:49.563
And here's your one way ticket.

1:32:51.133 --> 1:32:53.099
(Ronnie laughing)

1:32:53.101 --> 1:32:57.203
- No, oh, Savanna, you
don't wanna hurt me.

1:32:57.205 --> 1:32:59.406
You love me, and I love--

1:32:59.408 --> 1:33:01.374
(gunshot banging)
(squeaking)

1:33:01.376 --> 1:33:04.678
(light dramatic music)

1:33:13.789 --> 1:33:17.257
- Relax, what would I do
with you chumps anyway?

1:33:17.259 --> 1:33:21.227
I got bigger fish to
fry and a circus to run.

1:33:21.229 --> 1:33:23.263
Catch ya in the funny papers,
you hear?

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.567
- Okay, a promise is a promise.

1:33:27.569 --> 1:33:28.602
Let's get you two home.

1:33:28.604 --> 1:33:29.502
- Oh.

1:33:42.284 --> 1:33:45.518
(car engine rumbling)

1:34:11.546 --> 1:34:15.115
- Clownado, roll six, scene 36A,
take one.

1:34:17.185 --> 1:34:20.086
(Ronnie cackling)

1:34:24.693 --> 1:34:28.094
(Ronnie growling)
- Cut.

1:34:33.368 --> 1:34:35.769
(muffled talking)

1:34:35.771 --> 1:34:37.070
- Yeah.
(Hunter laughing)

1:34:37.072 --> 1:34:40.974
(blowing raspberries)
- Sorry.

1:34:42.177 --> 1:34:44.077
- Look man, I think...

1:34:47.816 --> 1:34:48.915
Fuck.

1:34:48.917 --> 1:34:50.550
- Clownado.
- Yeah!

1:34:50.552 --> 1:34:52.218
- We did it!
- Yeah!

1:34:56.692 --> 1:35:00.894
¶ Run for your life and don't
look back ¶

1:35:00.896 --> 1:35:04.597
¶ Killer clowns are risen
and are out to attack ¶

1:35:04.599 --> 1:35:07.801
¶ The smarts stop working in out
of fear ¶

1:35:07.803 --> 1:35:11.638
¶ As you see the machete
and the poles near ¶

1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:14.841
¶ Life alert signs, flutter your
gun ¶

1:35:14.843 --> 1:35:18.445
¶ You scream for your life
as you feel the first cut ¶

1:35:18.447 --> 1:35:21.748
¶ Death is the only joke tonight
¶

1:35:21.750 --> 1:35:25.285
¶ 'Cause clown are on a
bloodbath ride ¶

1:35:25.287 --> 1:35:28.755
¶ The color red rains down
tonight ¶

1:35:28.757 --> 1:35:32.125
¶ In this clownado fly ¶

1:35:32.127 --> 1:35:35.562
¶ Lock your doors and stay
inside ¶

1:35:35.564 --> 1:35:38.965
¶ Pray that they don't find your
hide ¶

1:35:38.967 --> 1:35:43.570
¶ The color red rains down
tonight ¶

1:35:43.572 --> 1:35:48.608
¶ In this clownado fly ¶

1:35:52.380 --> 1:35:56.015
¶ Don't move, don't make a sound
¶

1:35:56.017 --> 1:35:59.652
¶ You're now inside the
clownado playground ¶

1:35:59.654 --> 1:36:02.922
¶ No this is not the nightmare
dream ¶

1:36:02.924 --> 1:36:06.426
¶ In the distance, can
you hear that scream ¶

1:36:06.428 --> 1:36:10.764
¶ Reality perhaps stranger
than fiction at times ¶

1:36:10.766 --> 1:36:13.967
¶ Death bells ring out in their
chimes ¶

1:36:13.969 --> 1:36:16.336
¶ The water's squirting clowns
tonight ¶

1:36:16.338 --> 1:36:20.440
¶ Lies hanging abounds
in the clownado fight ¶

1:36:20.442 --> 1:36:23.543
¶ The color red rains down
tonight ¶

1:36:23.545 --> 1:36:27.080
¶ In this clownado fly ¶

1:36:27.082 --> 1:36:30.350
¶ Lock your doors and stay
inside ¶

1:36:30.352 --> 1:36:33.787
¶ Pray that they don't find your
hide ¶

1:36:33.789 --> 1:36:38.391
¶ The color red rains down
tonight ¶

1:36:38.393 --> 1:36:41.261
¶ In this clownado fly ¶

1:36:41.263 --> 1:36:43.096
- Fuck, yeah.

1:36:43.098 --> 1:36:44.364
Fuck me.

1:36:44.366 --> 1:36:46.099
Goddammit, yes.

1:36:46.101 --> 1:36:47.667
Sure.

1:36:47.669 --> 1:36:49.703
¶ Death is the only-- ¶

1:36:49.704 --> 1:36:51.738
- I can't hold it much longer,
Captain.

1:36:54.176 --> 1:36:56.710
Sorry.

1:36:56.711 --> 1:36:59.245
¶ These clowns are on a
bloodbath ride ¶

1:37:01.283 --> 1:37:05.485
¶ Death is the
only joke tonight ¶

1:37:05.487 --> 1:37:06.886
- Would you now?

1:37:08.757 --> 1:37:11.958
And this is where
we do some stuff.

1:37:15.063 --> 1:37:18.464
¶ The color red
rains down tonight ¶

1:37:18.466 --> 1:37:21.868
¶ In this clownado fly ¶

1:37:21.870 --> 1:37:25.238
¶ Lock your doors and stay
inside ¶

1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:28.641
¶ Pray that they
don't find your hide ¶

1:37:28.643 --> 1:37:33.246
¶ The color red rains down
tonight ¶

1:37:33.248 --> 1:37:38.318
¶ In this clownado fly ¶

1:37:40.155 --> 1:37:45.225
¶ In this clownado fly ¶

1:37:48.997 --> 1:37:50.897
¶ Woo ¶

1:38:02.711 --> 1:38:05.278
(light music)

1:39:42.877 --> 1:39:44.677
- Yeah, Captain Obvious.

1:39:50.752 --> 1:39:52.218
- I got a line?

1:39:52.220 --> 1:39:55.221
(producers laughing)
