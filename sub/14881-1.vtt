04:44.984 --> 04:49.489
Would it make you feel better
if we did a DNA test?

04:49.555 --> 04:50.857
-No.
-Are you sure?

05:54.787 --> 05:57.390
-Like, this is the truth. Done.
-<i>Because I don't need an answer.</i>

05:57.457 --> 05:59.892
-<i>So get over yourself. Bye.</i>
-It concerns you. What?

14:04.543 --> 14:07.046
People don't answer me.
They don't talk to me.

14:08.547 --> 14:12.251
<i>Bruce, my house is like, what,
15 minutes away from your house.</i>

14:12.318 --> 14:15.988
<i>While I'm in Dallas,
you can always stay at our house.</i>

14:17.957 --> 14:20.860
<i>My house is open for you
whenever you want it.</i>

20:18.483 --> 20:19.818
I don't like it.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.456
The floors bug me. There's no counter.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.102
It's too much work.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.709
You wanna look across the street?

20:46.612 --> 20:49.081
So there is the dressing rooms.

22:01.119 --> 22:03.822
-Hello.
-<i>Jenner, it is Disick.</i>

22:03.889 --> 22:07.125
-What are you doing, baby?
-<i>Is Bruce around by any chance?</i>

22:27.512 --> 22:29.381
-<i>Yeah, sure.</i>
-Okay, thanks, baby.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.116
-I will talk to you later.
-<i>Love you.</i>

29:34.806 --> 29:36.508
Are we waiting till KhloÃ© gets here
or something?

33:31.209 --> 33:32.076
But I'm over it!

42:51.068 --> 42:52.169
What the hell?

42:52.236 --> 42:53.771
Looks like they stole the f***ing car.
