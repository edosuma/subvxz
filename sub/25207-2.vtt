WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.903
You're ready to introduce me
as your girlfriend,

00:03.918 --> 00:05.598
but you're not ready to go down on me?

00:05.642 --> 00:07.687
I guess I was a little, uh,

00:07.731 --> 00:09.341
worried and scared.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.865
Everyone knows that Sutton
has been sleeping with him.

00:11.909 --> 00:13.214
It's the only reason she's getting

00:13.258 --> 00:14.999
- all these styling credits.
- It's a gamble.

00:15.042 --> 00:16.696
All of it. But I'm putting my money down

00:16.740 --> 00:18.219
on my career and believing

00:18.263 --> 00:19.699
that love will fall in place.

00:19.743 --> 00:21.571
My first subject is Emma Cox.

00:21.614 --> 00:23.689
I love that a customer knows
a homeless woman

00:23.724 --> 00:24.878
is gonna benefit from her purchase.

00:24.922 --> 00:26.619
Three of our clients
wound up in the hospital

00:26.663 --> 00:28.099
- with infections.
- Jane.

00:28.142 --> 00:31.015
So in about one minute, your vertical's
going to go live. Just a heads-up,

00:31.058 --> 00:32.799
- I made a few adjustments.
- Oh, shit.

00:36.789 --> 00:39.356
- Enjoy your Squeeze Press!
- Thank you.

00:43.152 --> 00:44.699
_

00:48.941 --> 00:51.721
_

00:53.806 --> 00:55.572
- Hey.
- Where are you?

00:55.608 --> 00:57.641
Squeeze Press.
At a table facing the office.

00:57.676 --> 01:00.677
Wait, what? I thought
we said the Midtown location?

01:00.713 --> 01:02.479
I've been looking forward
to this all morning!

01:02.515 --> 01:03.747
Why would we go to Midtown?

01:03.783 --> 01:05.649
Because that's where my appointment was.

01:05.684 --> 01:07.484
Hold on, it's Jane.

01:07.520 --> 01:08.752
Are you at the Midtown location?

01:08.788 --> 01:11.388
I'm at the Brooklyn location,
like we discussed.

01:11.423 --> 01:13.423
- Brooklyn?
- I'm in Midtown.

01:13.459 --> 01:15.425
Yeah, and I'm in Madison Square Park.

01:16.729 --> 01:18.495
- I'm dying to know.
- Okay, just tell us.

01:18.531 --> 01:19.630
- How was it?
- Well...

01:19.665 --> 01:21.632
then you know where to find me.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.600
Oh, and ladies?

01:23.636 --> 01:25.469
- It's worth it.
- Kat!

01:25.504 --> 01:28.438
First one there gets the details.

01:28.828 --> 01:29.573
No!

01:29.608 --> 01:30.674
- Yes, yes, yes!
- No! No!

01:30.709 --> 01:31.554
No!

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.050 --> 01:44.572
Oh, my God, I can't believe you guys.

01:44.591 --> 01:46.790
- And, Jane, your shoes.
- Oh, please, she doesn't care.

01:46.826 --> 01:48.559
Yeah, the only thing
I care about right now

01:48.594 --> 01:51.428
is you telling us what it was like
to go down on Adena.

01:51.463 --> 01:52.830
Go ahead.

01:53.837 --> 01:56.567
Well, uh, it was awesome.

01:56.602 --> 01:58.468
I mean, I was completely
freaked out at first.

01:58.504 --> 01:59.570
- Of course.
- Who wouldn't be?

01:59.605 --> 02:00.771
Then I realized

02:00.806 --> 02:02.573
I have one of these,
and I know what I like.

02:02.608 --> 02:04.608
So, I did it.

02:04.643 --> 02:06.610
And I liked it. A lot.

02:06.645 --> 02:08.345
- Ooh!
- That's amazing.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.646
And things with Adena are awesome.

02:10.683 --> 02:13.617
- God, I miss Richard sex.
- Oh, babe.

02:13.652 --> 02:14.992
You just need a distraction.

02:15.054 --> 02:16.687
I just want to like a guy again,
you know?

02:16.722 --> 02:17.728
Yeah.

02:18.557 --> 02:19.526
Oh, great.

02:19.559 --> 02:21.725
- I have to go deal with this Emma Cox takedown.
- _

02:21.760 --> 02:23.012
Actually, we have to go too.

02:23.062 --> 02:24.561
- Jacqueline pitch meeting.
- All right.

02:24.597 --> 02:26.430
Uh, hey. Baby?

02:26.465 --> 02:28.732
The Emma Cox thing is gonna be fine.

02:28.767 --> 02:30.801
- Mm...
- Mm-kay.

02:30.836 --> 02:33.403
Guys, are you gonna
walk with me like this?

02:33.439 --> 02:34.738
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

02:34.773 --> 02:36.346
Off to work.

02:44.583 --> 02:46.516
Hey, Victoria. Do you have a second?

02:46.552 --> 02:48.585
What's up?

02:48.621 --> 02:51.822
My piece on Emma Cox
is completely different

02:51.857 --> 02:54.391
than what I handed in.

02:54.426 --> 02:56.727
Do you know why
we call this place "Incite"?

02:56.762 --> 03:00.364
- Because it...
- Because we incite conversations.

03:00.399 --> 03:02.633
Your nuanced piece on when
good intentions go bad

03:02.668 --> 03:03.813
didn't do that.

03:03.870 --> 03:07.471
But the part where Emma Cox
brands OTR as charitable,

03:07.506 --> 03:10.307
even after her product
makes homeless women sick

03:10.342 --> 03:11.475
<i>was</i> interesting.

03:11.510 --> 03:13.677
So I made that the article.

03:13.712 --> 03:15.445
I get that. Um...

03:15.481 --> 03:17.648
It's just, you hired me for my voice...

03:17.683 --> 03:19.919
When it aligns with "Incite's" brand.

03:19.952 --> 03:22.719
You just missed the mark this time.

03:22.755 --> 03:24.488
I just wish that I would have seen it

03:24.523 --> 03:26.356
before it went live.
At... at "Scarlet"...

03:26.392 --> 03:28.659
This is not "Scarlet," Jane.

03:32.498 --> 03:33.764
Right.

03:34.437 --> 03:37.367
Another hero caught
beating off on camera.

03:37.403 --> 03:39.469
How hard is it to keep
your junk in your trunk?

03:39.505 --> 03:41.405
I don't think you're using that right.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.340
- Not the point.
- When in doubt,

03:43.375 --> 03:44.741
- don't pull it out.
- Exactly.

03:44.777 --> 03:46.510
Not that hard.

03:46.545 --> 03:49.346
Ooh, I do not envy any of you

03:49.381 --> 03:51.715
having to navigate
dating in this climate.

03:51.750 --> 03:55.519
So there is something else
that we need to talk about.

03:55.554 --> 03:57.354
Our allies.

03:57.389 --> 03:59.723
The guys who show up at women's rallies,

03:59.758 --> 04:02.292
and who speak up when others are silent.

04:02.328 --> 04:05.495
I want to do a roundup of honorable men.

04:05.531 --> 04:07.664
Good doctors, firefighters,

04:07.700 --> 04:09.433
human rights activists.

04:09.468 --> 04:10.667
Alex, you'll do the interviews.

04:10.703 --> 04:12.636
And we'll make it a fashion spread.

04:12.671 --> 04:14.504
Can't we just do a write-up?

04:14.540 --> 04:17.574
You know how I hate styling
the general population.

04:17.608 --> 04:19.409
I have faith in you, Oliver.

04:19.445 --> 04:21.445
And you have a great support staff.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.348
And a meditation app, if you need it.

04:24.383 --> 04:26.550
Kat, we need to bank some content

04:26.585 --> 04:29.453
for Snapchat, and this photo shoot
will be a perfect place to start.

04:29.488 --> 04:31.388
Hashtag "they're not all bad,"

04:31.423 --> 04:32.756
you know... you make that better.

04:32.791 --> 04:33.875
- Yeah.
- All right, so,

04:33.926 --> 04:36.526
what's in the hopper for our
"Love and Lust" section?

04:36.562 --> 04:38.662
Uh, household appliances
that will charge up

04:38.697 --> 04:41.365
- your sex life.
- Electric toothbrush.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.600
What?

04:43.635 --> 04:45.469
What, nobody else...

04:45.504 --> 04:47.771
And a Waterpik.

04:47.806 --> 04:49.473
- People still use those?
- They will,

04:49.508 --> 04:50.640
- after they read my article.
- Hmm.

04:50.676 --> 04:52.542
- Give me your top six.
- Sure.

04:52.578 --> 04:53.744
All right, everyone, that's it.

04:53.779 --> 04:56.446
Uh, Kat, can you hang back for a moment?

04:56.482 --> 04:57.681
Sure.

04:58.751 --> 05:00.745
Now that you are a department head,

05:00.820 --> 05:02.586
I'm going to need your bio

05:02.621 --> 05:05.389
for speaking engagements
and media tie-ins.

05:05.424 --> 05:07.424
I really want you out there
as the face of social.

05:07.459 --> 05:09.292
- Great.
- You do have a bio, right?

05:09.328 --> 05:10.761
I have...

05:10.796 --> 05:13.363
a Twitter bio and an Insta bio.

05:13.399 --> 05:14.631
All right, well,
I'm gonna need something

05:14.666 --> 05:16.433
a little bit more professional.
You know,

05:16.468 --> 05:18.468
just a couple paragraphs,
make it interesting.

05:18.504 --> 05:20.437
People are gonna want to
know who Kat Edison is.

05:20.472 --> 05:21.571
Okay.

05:21.607 --> 05:23.607
Richard. Good to see you.

05:23.642 --> 05:25.542
To what do I owe this honor?

05:25.577 --> 05:29.312
A board seat just became available.

05:29.348 --> 05:32.682
Oh. Did someone die, or move to Boca?

05:32.718 --> 05:35.719
Stanley Rogers retired
to spend more time with his family.

05:35.754 --> 05:37.554
And you're telling me this because...

05:37.589 --> 05:39.689
I think you should go for it.

05:39.725 --> 05:41.425
It'd be a lot of fun
to have you upstairs.

05:41.532 --> 05:43.760
We could really
shake things up from the inside.

05:43.796 --> 05:46.463
Mm, that would be fun,
and I love the idea

05:46.498 --> 05:47.731
of another woman being upstairs.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.533
But you and I both know
I'm not leaving "Scarlet."

05:49.568 --> 05:51.334
Unless, of course,
that's no longer a conflict.

05:51.370 --> 05:53.670
No, it is.

05:53.705 --> 05:55.165
I figured it was a long shot,

05:55.207 --> 05:56.573
but you can't blame a guy
for trying, right?

05:57.776 --> 05:59.509
Well, keep me updated on who they find.

05:59.545 --> 06:00.744
Of course.

06:00.779 --> 06:03.280
Everything else good?

06:03.315 --> 06:04.614
Yeah, good enough.

06:08.687 --> 06:10.520
Red. Men like you.

06:10.556 --> 06:12.756
Walk with me.

06:12.791 --> 06:14.658
- Figures.
- You don't know this,

06:14.693 --> 06:16.326
well, because you're young,

06:16.361 --> 06:20.330
but styling the general population
is hell, even if they are handsome.

06:20.365 --> 06:21.565
Which is why I want you
to be my right hand.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.433
- Got it.
- And my left.

06:23.469 --> 06:25.469
Here's your binder of extraordinary men.

06:25.504 --> 06:27.370
Pick five who can be
here in the morning.

06:27.406 --> 06:29.406
- Tomorrow morning?
- You'll need to fit them.

06:29.441 --> 06:32.509
These are not models,
so they are not one size fits all.

06:32.544 --> 06:35.712
Oh, and Red, these guys are amateurs
when it comes to photo shoots,

06:35.747 --> 06:38.648
so they're going to need
a lot of hand-holding.

06:38.684 --> 06:40.684
You're welcome.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.762
_

06:56.668 --> 06:58.335
"Emma Cox is a fraud."

06:58.370 --> 06:59.736
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

06:59.771 --> 07:01.738
Are "Incite" readers always this harsh?

07:01.773 --> 07:03.473
Yep.

07:03.509 --> 07:05.408
And I take it you don't agree with them.

07:05.444 --> 07:08.311
Yeah, because they only
have one side of the story.

07:08.347 --> 07:11.314
I mean, she did one bad thing,
and it wasn't on purpose.

07:11.350 --> 07:13.316
Oof! Brutal.

07:13.352 --> 07:14.684
Come on, we have a pitch meeting.

07:16.455 --> 07:18.321
Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.393
_

07:33.639 --> 07:35.405
<i>Hi, this is Emma Cox.</i>

07:35.440 --> 07:36.673
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

07:36.708 --> 07:40.644
Hi, Emma. This is Jane Sloan
from "Incite." I just wanted to say

07:40.679 --> 07:42.379
<i>how sorry I am.</i>

07:42.414 --> 07:44.648
Ooh, working on your bio?

07:44.683 --> 07:46.383
Kind of.

07:49.588 --> 07:50.787
Is that Susan and Marcus?

07:51.701 --> 07:52.589
Yeah.

07:55.661 --> 07:57.494
Huh.

07:57.529 --> 07:58.662
I want you to meet them.

07:58.697 --> 08:00.580
I'm supposed to have dinner
with them tomorrow night,

08:00.615 --> 08:04.367
so maybe we could
invite them over, or...

08:04.403 --> 08:05.669
Um...

08:05.704 --> 08:08.605
are you sure you want me to be there?

08:08.640 --> 08:10.707
I know you've never introduced
anyone you were dating

08:10.742 --> 08:12.309
to your parents before.

08:12.344 --> 08:13.743
Yes, I'm sure.

08:13.779 --> 08:16.513
Not to mention, a woman.

08:17.516 --> 08:20.383
They know. They're cool.

08:20.419 --> 08:23.587
They want to meet the
person I'm crazy about.

08:23.622 --> 08:26.389
Okay.

08:26.425 --> 08:28.558
Then, uh, I'd better do my research.

08:28.594 --> 08:30.594
Mm-hmm.

08:32.764 --> 08:35.732
Each page just keeps
getting better and better.

08:35.767 --> 08:37.734
Their careers are very impressive.

08:37.769 --> 08:39.535
Who are you? "Their careers

08:39.571 --> 08:41.404
are very impressive?"
Have you even looked

08:41.440 --> 08:44.116
- at this binder?
- It's a binder of professional men.

08:44.476 --> 08:46.710
It is a binder of hot men,

08:46.745 --> 08:48.511
and you get to fit them.

08:48.547 --> 08:49.809
Because men like me.

08:49.882 --> 08:51.581
Okay, someone's cocky.

08:51.617 --> 08:53.683
Oliver's words, not mine.

08:53.719 --> 08:56.586
Do you think Oliver wants my help
because he heard people talking,

08:56.622 --> 08:58.355
and he thinks I'm the office flirt?

08:58.390 --> 08:59.656
No.

08:59.691 --> 09:02.525
I think he wants your help
because you're good at your job.

09:02.561 --> 09:04.327
- All right.
- But that doesn't mean

09:04.363 --> 09:08.298
you can't still enjoy some eye candy
with your best friend.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.566
How cute is this guy?

09:09.601 --> 09:11.434
And he's a doctor.

09:11.470 --> 09:13.470
With a free clinic.

09:13.505 --> 09:14.979
I think I have an itch.

09:15.007 --> 09:16.740
You do know this is a
round-up of good guys

09:16.775 --> 09:18.608
in light of all the
sexual harassment claims?

09:18.644 --> 09:20.644
Oh, and I'm objectifying them.

09:20.679 --> 09:22.712
Yeah.

09:22.748 --> 09:24.748
I see the irony, and I'm okay with it.

09:24.783 --> 09:26.549
Why did I leave "Scarlet," again?

09:26.585 --> 09:28.518
Because you wanted to do
hard-hitting journalism.

09:28.553 --> 09:30.253
Well, you know what I would hit hard?

09:30.434 --> 09:31.721
That.

09:31.757 --> 09:33.096
Oh, what is this?

09:38.597 --> 09:40.782
What's "Sorry Not Sorry Jane Sloan"?

09:40.833 --> 09:42.367
It's getting retweeted like crazy.

09:42.468 --> 09:46.436
<i>Hi, Emma. This is Jane Sloan
from "Incite." I just wanted to say</i>

09:46.471 --> 09:47.637
<i>how sorry I am.</i>

09:47.673 --> 09:48.925
<i>That's not the article I wrote.</i>

09:49.008 --> 09:51.308
<i>It was turned into a total hit piece.</i>

09:51.343 --> 09:52.490
- Call Kat.
- Yeah.

09:52.544 --> 09:53.832
<i>If you could give me a
call when you get this,</i>

09:53.846 --> 09:54.812
<i>that would be great.</i>

09:58.936 --> 10:01.798
Great. 956 retweets.

10:01.964 --> 10:03.063
How could she do this?

10:03.098 --> 10:04.717
She put my voicemail on Twitter.

10:05.801 --> 10:07.535
Why would she humiliate me like this?

10:07.570 --> 10:10.504
I was trying to apologize.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.606
Maybe I should just email
her my original article,

10:12.642 --> 10:14.041
- and she'll take it down.
- No.

10:14.073 --> 10:15.714
Have you learned nothing
from this experience?

10:15.779 --> 10:17.511
Well, I should at least email Victoria

10:17.547 --> 10:18.579
- and tell her what happened...
- Hey!

10:18.614 --> 10:19.680
- Do not touch...
- No, no.

10:19.715 --> 10:21.549
...the computer.

10:21.584 --> 10:23.517
- But Victoria is...
- Will handle it.

10:23.553 --> 10:25.319
Remember when the stripper sued you?

10:25.354 --> 10:26.520
Jacqueline took care of it.

10:26.556 --> 10:27.688
This is way above your pay grade.

10:28.692 --> 10:29.623
Wonderful.

10:29.659 --> 10:31.592
"Sorry Not Sorry" is trending.

10:31.627 --> 10:32.793
Not the Demi Lovato version.

10:32.828 --> 10:35.362
Yeah, but it's totally gonna blow over.

10:35.398 --> 10:36.597
- Right, Kat?
- Absolutely.

10:36.632 --> 10:38.332
These things have a 24-hour lifespan.

10:38.367 --> 10:39.433
<i>Just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

10:39.468 --> 10:40.668
<i>so-so-sorry I am.</i>

10:40.703 --> 10:42.436
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

10:42.471 --> 10:43.804
<i>This is Jane-Jane-Jane</i>

10:43.839 --> 10:45.639
<i>Jane-Jane-Jane Sloan.
I just wanted to say</i>

10:45.675 --> 10:47.675
<i>how sorry... so-so-sorry I am.</i>

10:47.710 --> 10:49.543
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

10:49.579 --> 10:52.346
<i>This is Jane-Jane-Jane
Jane-Jane-Jane Sloan.</i>

10:52.381 --> 10:53.581
<i>I just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

10:53.616 --> 10:55.482
<i>- so-so-sorry I am.</i>
- Sorry.

10:55.518 --> 10:57.484
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

10:58.688 --> 10:59.753
It's not funny.

11:05.761 --> 11:07.628
Hi, can I help you?

11:07.663 --> 11:10.331
Tim Benson. NYFD lieutenant.

11:10.366 --> 11:11.599
Sage, "Scarlet" sex writer.

11:11.634 --> 11:13.434
I'm here for a fitting.

11:13.469 --> 11:14.668
- We all are.
- Okay.

11:14.704 --> 11:16.537
Oh, right!

11:16.572 --> 11:18.439
Right, uh,

11:18.474 --> 11:20.441
sit tight, I will be right back.

11:20.476 --> 11:21.508
Okay.

11:22.712 --> 11:25.646
Oh! Whoops! Excuse me.

11:28.517 --> 11:30.517
Sutton, there's some men in reception.

11:30.553 --> 11:32.453
Real men. Not models.

11:32.488 --> 11:34.455
People with impressive jobs.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.424
Uh, yeah. Right. Whatever.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.726
Uh, do you want me to wait
with the guys in reception?

11:38.761 --> 11:40.561
- I really don't mind.
- That's okay.

11:40.596 --> 11:41.595
Just send them over to me.

11:41.631 --> 11:43.731
Okay, if you need anything,

11:43.766 --> 11:45.733
- I am...
- Just send 'em on down.

11:45.768 --> 11:47.468
Okay.

11:50.740 --> 11:53.407
Hey. Can I ask you a favor?

11:53.442 --> 11:55.442
- What's up?
- Okay, I was just wondering

11:55.478 --> 11:57.811
if you could take a look at my bio

11:57.847 --> 12:00.648
and make sure it's reading okay
before I give it to Jacqueline.

12:00.683 --> 12:02.383
I'd be honored.

12:02.418 --> 12:04.418
Hmm. Hmm.

12:05.209 --> 12:06.587
Oh, my God, I...

12:06.622 --> 12:08.589
I already hate this.
I could never be a writer.

12:08.624 --> 12:10.290
Well, see, the key is to add

12:10.326 --> 12:12.493
- as much detail as possible.
- Okay.

12:12.528 --> 12:14.628
Like, you could add the fact
that you're black.

12:14.664 --> 12:17.297
It'll read something like, "Kat Edison

12:17.333 --> 12:20.734
is 'Scarlet' magazine's
first black female department head."

12:20.770 --> 12:23.671
See, that sounds impressive.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.539
Yeah, but it's also irrelevant.

12:25.574 --> 12:26.509
You know, I'm a department head.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.575
That has nothing to do
with the color of my skin.

12:28.611 --> 12:30.477
Okay...

12:30.513 --> 12:31.679
it's a big part of who you are.

12:31.714 --> 12:34.648
Yeah, but I'm also part white,
and no one asked me to write that down.

12:34.684 --> 12:38.419
Not the same thing, but okay.

12:38.454 --> 12:40.181
Uh, any other suggestions?

12:40.446 --> 12:43.254
Yeah... Kat, you have
this really cool opportunity

12:43.289 --> 12:45.189
to be a role model
for young black girls.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.224
Don't you want that?

12:47.260 --> 12:50.327
Why would you ask me that?
Of course I want that.

12:50.363 --> 12:53.516
But I want it regardless of my race,
not because of it.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.366
It's what's on the inside that matters.

12:55.401 --> 12:58.036
But you're black on the inside too, Kat.

12:58.071 --> 12:59.470
Oh, really?

13:01.784 --> 13:04.241
Are... are you questioning
my blackness right now?

13:04.667 --> 13:07.311
Because, uh, up until very recently,

13:07.346 --> 13:09.280
you were wearing khakis and cardigans,

13:09.315 --> 13:13.284
which is just about the whitest
fashion statement imaginable.

13:13.319 --> 13:15.252
That is an interesting projection

13:15.288 --> 13:17.154
- of internalized racism.
- Oh, cool.

13:17.189 --> 13:20.224
- So now I'm a racist?
- I didn't say that.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.492
Yeah, you didn't have to.

13:31.118 --> 13:32.369
This'll only take a second.

13:32.405 --> 13:35.205
Oh, no problem.

13:35.241 --> 13:37.274
When in "Scarlet," am I right?

13:37.310 --> 13:40.177
If you're Sutton, then yes.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.547
Why do you get all
the good assignments, Sutton?

13:43.583 --> 13:45.316
It's 'cause men like her.

13:45.351 --> 13:48.319
At least that's why
Oliver gave her the job.

13:48.354 --> 13:51.155
We're... We're just jealous.

13:51.190 --> 13:52.456
Speak for yourself.

13:52.827 --> 13:54.002
Don't listen to them.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.421
Oh!

13:57.330 --> 14:00.531
Okay, you're good! You can...

14:00.566 --> 14:02.333
put your clothes back on now.

14:02.368 --> 14:03.400
Thank you.

14:05.171 --> 14:08.172
Remember: measure twice, cut once.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.246
<i>I just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

14:16.282 --> 14:17.481
<i>so-so-sorry I am.</i>

14:17.516 --> 14:19.249
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

14:19.285 --> 14:20.284
<i>This is Jane-Jane-Jane</i>

14:20.319 --> 14:21.518
<i>Jane-Jane-Jane Sloan.</i>

14:21.554 --> 14:23.253
<i>I just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

14:23.289 --> 14:24.388
<i>so-so-sorry I am.</i>

14:24.423 --> 14:26.290
<i>How sorry I am...</i>

14:26.325 --> 14:27.491
Victoria, I'm...

14:27.526 --> 14:29.460
- I'm so sorry.
- Apparently.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.162
Those words just seem
to flow out of your mouth.

14:32.198 --> 14:33.530
I know I screwed up.

14:33.566 --> 14:36.200
I should have never
contacted Emma, but...

14:36.235 --> 14:37.501
You did screw up. We just need

14:37.536 --> 14:39.236
to change the narrative
and show that "Incite"

14:39.271 --> 14:41.205
is a serious publication.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.376
I've already booked
an interview on NY14.

14:46.646 --> 14:49.513
Oh, thank you so much
for taking care of this.

14:49.548 --> 14:50.629
Me?

14:51.183 --> 14:53.550
No. You're going on television,
and it's live.

14:55.454 --> 14:58.155
Have we media trained you yet?

14:58.190 --> 14:59.133
No.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.999
Okay, you ready?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.220
I was born ready.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.643
Just another one of the
things I love about you.

15:13.165 --> 15:14.378
Oh!

15:14.413 --> 15:15.646
Coming!

15:19.315 --> 15:21.718
- Hey.
- So good to see you.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.786
Oh...

15:24.757 --> 15:26.823
Hey, babe. Come here.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.177
Hey, missy.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.628
Mom, Dad,

15:31.664 --> 15:32.796
this is Adena.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.531
It's so good to meet you, Adena.

15:34.566 --> 15:35.641
Such a pleasure.

15:37.536 --> 15:38.702
And, uh...

15:38.737 --> 15:40.504
so nice to meet you, Dr. Edison...

15:40.539 --> 15:42.506
- Ah, hey. Marcus.
- Marcus.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.409
Come on, come on.

15:48.747 --> 15:50.222
Wardrobe came in for tomorrow,

15:50.249 --> 15:54.618
and unless one of your honorable men
is a pirate...

15:54.653 --> 15:56.520
I must have written the
measurements down wrong.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.819
I thought you grew up
making your own clothes.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.823
Or was that just a story
you sold me to get you hired?

15:59.858 --> 16:01.625
No, I made my entire wardrobe.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.660
Good. Then you can fix this.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.462
And whatever's going on,
for the love of God,

16:05.497 --> 16:07.564
get it together.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.817
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:28.007 --> 16:28.719
After you.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.602
Uh, I just realized I forgot something.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.277
I mean, I went to him
for a simple suggestion,

16:55.347 --> 16:56.895
and then he told me that
I should add the fact

16:56.983 --> 16:59.062
that I'm the first black
female department head.

16:59.118 --> 17:03.453
I just don't really see
how that kind of detail is necessary.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.521
Your bios don't list your race.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.324
Because it has nothing
to do with our ability

17:07.358 --> 17:08.692
- to treat patients.
- Exactly!

17:08.727 --> 17:12.596
The color of my skin has no bearing
on my performance as a department head.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.498
No one said it did.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.334
Well, Alex seems to think
it's my responsibility

17:17.368 --> 17:19.469
- or something...
- No, your responsibility

17:19.505 --> 17:20.704
- is to be true to yourself
- Yeah.

17:20.739 --> 17:22.539
You don't need labels to do that.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.509
But... why are labels a bad thing?

17:25.544 --> 17:29.446
My bio literally reads,
"proud Muslim lesbian."

17:29.481 --> 17:30.814
It's a part of who I am.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.716
Why wouldn't I want everyone to know?

17:36.734 --> 17:37.654
Oh.

17:39.038 --> 17:40.390
Excuse me.

17:41.980 --> 17:44.795
You know what, this is Jacqueline,
so I'm just gonna take it real quick.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.564
I'll be right back.

17:47.565 --> 17:49.266
Hi, Jacqueline!

17:49.768 --> 17:51.810
It's important you hit
all the talking points.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.804
Other than admitting you
were wrong to call Emma,

17:53.839 --> 17:57.407
and apologize,
this is not about Jane Sloan.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.609
It's about preserving
the integrity of "Incite."

17:59.645 --> 18:01.545
- It's about?
- Uh, "Incite" being

18:01.580 --> 18:03.780
a hard-hitting,
factually accurate news outlet.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.944
Exactly.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.684
Emma Cox misrepresented
her organization.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.553
How did she misrepresent
her organization?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.142
Uh, by calling the company "charitable,"

18:11.157 --> 18:13.952
even after her product
made a group of homeless women sick.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.593
Remember, "Incite"
chases the stories that matter,

18:16.628 --> 18:18.595
- even when it's difficult.
- And, um...

18:18.630 --> 18:20.664
what if they ask me about

18:20.699 --> 18:22.699
why I reached out to apologize to Emma?

18:22.734 --> 18:23.774
Tell the truth.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.636
You're new to "Incite"
and hard-hitting journalism.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.406
And you got too personally invested.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.475
And, Jane, your style.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.711
You're gonna have to lose all of that
for the interview.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.814
You're representing "Incite" now.
Not "Scarlet."

18:40.436 --> 18:42.369
Of course.

18:44.273 --> 18:46.139
So...

18:46.175 --> 18:47.507
- she's great, right?
- She is.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.445
- Dad?
- What are her parents like?

18:51.480 --> 18:53.146
Uh...

18:53.182 --> 18:54.348
honestly, I don't really know.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.149
I mean, she talks to her mom a lot,

18:56.185 --> 18:58.118
but I don't know much about her dad.

18:58.153 --> 19:00.354
I think she left home kind of early.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.322
- That's interesting.
- Oh, please,

19:02.358 --> 19:04.291
do not psychoanalyze my girlfriend.

19:04.326 --> 19:05.416
- Marcus.
- No, what?

19:05.495 --> 19:07.394
I mean she's rebellious,
the way she insists

19:07.429 --> 19:09.162
on people knowing who she
is and what she stands for.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.331
- Mm-hmm.
- It just seems almost...

19:11.367 --> 19:13.367
- adolescent.
- Okay, how about this?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.369
How about, "Thanks for dinner, Kat."

19:15.404 --> 19:17.471
And, "I'm glad to see you happy."

19:22.344 --> 19:23.631
Thanks for dinner, Kat.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.412
Good night.

19:27.449 --> 19:31.084
- I'm so happy you're home.
- Yeah.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.120
- Love you, baby.
- Bye.

19:48.470 --> 19:51.405
I always thought side-by-side
washer and dryers

19:51.440 --> 19:55.108
were a waste of space until now.

19:55.144 --> 19:56.510
Did you know that women

19:56.545 --> 19:59.313
can have six different kinds...

19:59.348 --> 20:01.381
It's not important.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.417
- Okay.
- So let me guess.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.584
Another old white guy.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.553
You wanted a woman, right?

20:06.588 --> 20:10.223
- We got Cleo Williams.
- The digital fitness mogul?

20:10.259 --> 20:12.359
Yeah. Her perspective is impressive,

20:12.394 --> 20:15.228
and since we're revamping
our online image,

20:15.264 --> 20:16.363
made sense to bring her on.

20:16.398 --> 20:18.298
Send me her contact info.

20:18.334 --> 20:20.200
I want to welcome her properly.

20:24.406 --> 20:26.506
Your parents seem lovely.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.275
Yeah.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.601
You know, they try.

20:29.612 --> 20:32.145
Even though they are psychiatrists.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.482
Well, they didn't mess you up.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.185
Yeah, I hope not.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.487
You know, what I said earlier, um,

20:40.522 --> 20:42.356
about your bio. It's up to you.

20:42.391 --> 20:46.226
- Yeah, I know.
- We all have our own way.

20:46.261 --> 20:49.396
And mine has always been
to put it all out there.

20:49.431 --> 20:51.631
I... I can't imagine
living any differently.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.367
But...

20:53.402 --> 20:55.302
that's just how I do things.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.170
Doesn't make my way

20:57.206 --> 21:01.208
or Alex's way any better
or worse than yours.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.811
Uh, Jacqueline? This is Cleo.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.646
Oh, Cleo!

21:24.681 --> 21:26.214
I'm so happy you could stop by.

21:26.230 --> 21:29.298
Oh, are you kidding?
I am thrilled to finally meet you.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.233
I've been a fan of yours
since I was in my 20s.

21:31.862 --> 21:34.303
Well, now you're here
on the board, overseeing "Scarlet."

21:34.338 --> 21:36.471
- Mm.
- Uh, please.

21:36.507 --> 21:38.240
- Thank you.
- Coffee?

21:38.275 --> 21:40.075
Oh, no, that stuff will kill you.

21:40.110 --> 21:43.412
Well, I am hearing many
wonderful things about you

21:43.447 --> 21:44.747
- from the board.
- Oh.

21:44.789 --> 21:47.349
- They are very excited.
- Well, I am hugely excited

21:47.384 --> 21:51.153
for the opportunity. Particularly,
the chance to expand digital.

21:51.188 --> 21:53.255
What made you want to get
into the digital space

21:53.290 --> 21:55.057
- to begin with?
- Besides the fact

21:55.092 --> 21:57.359
that it's the future of everything?

21:57.394 --> 21:59.261
You do know that our print magazine

21:59.296 --> 22:01.229
sets the trends,
and digital comments on them.

22:01.265 --> 22:04.299
Yes, of course. But, in my experience,

22:04.335 --> 22:07.269
I've seen the power of the internet.

22:07.304 --> 22:10.305
When I first started,
I was just a bored mom,

22:10.341 --> 22:14.009
making these workout videos
to share with my other mom friends.

22:14.044 --> 22:17.145
Now I run a fitness empire
that reaches millions

22:17.181 --> 22:18.480
from the palm of my hand.

22:18.515 --> 22:20.449
And it allows me to
have dinner on the table

22:20.484 --> 22:22.217
every night for my family.

22:22.252 --> 22:25.287
I can have my homemade rice cakes
and eat them too, I guess.

22:25.322 --> 22:26.912
All while doing squats.

22:26.947 --> 22:28.216
And taking selfies.

22:29.059 --> 22:30.325
Should we take one for
my Instagram followers?

22:30.361 --> 22:33.428
I think they'd be really
thrilled to see an image of me

22:33.464 --> 22:35.364
with Jacqueline Carlyle.

22:35.399 --> 22:37.032
- Sure.
- Okay.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.516
Sutton, a bit of help?

22:56.487 --> 22:58.120
Uh...

22:58.155 --> 23:00.322
Hands-on, Red.

23:00.357 --> 23:02.991
- Uh, let me help you.
- Yeah.

23:10.467 --> 23:14.036
- All right.
- Cool, thanks.

23:21.245 --> 23:22.377
You're only eating the green ones.

23:22.413 --> 23:24.079
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

23:24.114 --> 23:25.280
Mm.

23:25.315 --> 23:29.117
- How about a Boomerang?
- Okay.

23:29.153 --> 23:31.053
It's social media, be positive.

23:31.088 --> 23:32.287
Red!

23:34.324 --> 23:36.191
- We going with that one?
- That's fine.

23:36.226 --> 23:38.293
Mm-hmm.

23:38.328 --> 23:39.461
We have a problem.

23:39.496 --> 23:41.263
Apparently he can deliver a baby

23:41.298 --> 23:43.098
without breaking a sweat,
but ask him to smile

23:43.133 --> 23:45.033
for the camera, and he freezes
like a deer in headlights.

23:45.069 --> 23:47.235
Go over there and get...
get him to relax,

23:47.271 --> 23:49.404
for the love of God.
I need good photographs.

23:51.308 --> 23:53.208
I'm a glorified fluffer.

23:55.079 --> 23:57.345
- How's it going, Kat?
- I am getting great snaps.

23:57.381 --> 24:00.449
Good, good. How's your bio coming?

24:00.484 --> 24:03.085
Bio. Uh, yeah.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.286
- It's almost done.
- Yeah? Good.

24:04.321 --> 24:06.188
I need it on my desk tomorrow morning.

24:06.223 --> 24:08.123
You got it.

24:12.396 --> 24:15.130
Still sitting on that bio, huh?

24:15.165 --> 24:17.466
I really don't feel like talking.

24:17.501 --> 24:19.334
I didn't mean for things
to get so heated.

24:19.369 --> 24:21.236
Nope, it's all good.

24:21.271 --> 24:24.039
I just thought that you...

24:24.074 --> 24:27.342
you've always been this
super confident badass.

24:27.377 --> 24:30.212
You speak your mind.
You stand up for what you want.

24:30.247 --> 24:33.148
Point is, you never back down.

24:33.183 --> 24:36.151
Not with your friends,
not your girlfriend,

24:36.186 --> 24:38.320
and definitely not with work.

24:38.355 --> 24:43.391
But when I brought up
adding "black" to your bio,

24:43.427 --> 24:45.227
a wall goes up?

24:49.466 --> 24:51.266
Yeah, you're right.

24:58.142 --> 25:01.042
Do you know how everyone
always wants to...

25:01.078 --> 25:03.211
be able to put you in a box, right?

25:03.247 --> 25:04.346
- Mm-hmm.
- Black, white,

25:04.381 --> 25:06.248
girl, boy.

25:06.283 --> 25:09.184
Even those standardized tests
they make you take as a kid.

25:09.219 --> 25:11.086
You know,
where you have to fill in the bubbles?

25:11.121 --> 25:16.024
I remember getting to the section
that says, "Select your race,

25:16.059 --> 25:17.392
Caucasian or African-American,"

25:17.427 --> 25:19.027
you don't have any other choice...

25:19.062 --> 25:21.329
and thinking...

25:21.365 --> 25:23.064
like, how do I pick?

25:23.100 --> 25:26.201
I mean, 'cause if...

25:26.236 --> 25:29.104
if I pick, uh...

25:29.139 --> 25:31.439
if I pick black,
then I'm rejecting my mom.

25:31.475 --> 25:35.243
And if I pick white,
then I'm rejecting my dad.

25:35.279 --> 25:37.279
So what did you pick?

25:37.314 --> 25:40.348
Well, actually, I just left it blank.

25:40.384 --> 25:44.486
It was easier to deny
both than to pick one.

25:44.521 --> 25:46.454
But...

25:46.490 --> 25:49.291
you're not a kid anymore.

25:49.326 --> 25:52.093
And standing up for who you are matters.

25:54.097 --> 25:55.263
Yeah, I know.

26:08.045 --> 26:10.011
Chad Horford. Nice to meet you.

26:10.047 --> 26:11.313
Jane Sloan.

26:11.348 --> 26:13.114
You're nervous. Don't be nervous.

26:13.150 --> 26:14.382
It's the first time I've done
something like this.

26:14.418 --> 26:17.185
Ah, don't worry about it. It'll be good.

26:17.221 --> 26:18.353
We're on air in two seconds.

26:21.024 --> 26:23.992
Hello, New York.
If you're a fan of "Incite,"

26:24.027 --> 26:26.194
then you've probably
heard of Jane Sloan,

26:26.230 --> 26:29.264
best known for her apology
to OTR's Emma Cox

26:29.299 --> 26:31.266
that went viral. Now, Jane is here

26:31.301 --> 26:34.336
to set the record straight
in her own words.

26:34.371 --> 26:36.304
- Thank you for having me.
- We have a full slate,

26:36.340 --> 26:38.306
so let's get right to it.
You wrote an article

26:38.342 --> 26:40.208
on Emma Cox, which,

26:40.244 --> 26:42.444
according to your now
very public apology,

26:42.479 --> 26:44.279
was heavily edited.

26:44.314 --> 26:46.214
So what happened?

26:46.250 --> 26:49.217
Is "Incite" fabricating their stories?

26:49.253 --> 26:50.172
No.

26:50.254 --> 26:54.289
"Incite" is a hard-hitting,
factually accurate news outlet.

26:54.324 --> 26:58.126
She misrepresented her company
as a charitable organization,

26:58.161 --> 27:00.328
and "Incite" readers
deserve to hear that story

27:00.364 --> 27:01.363
as much as anything else.

27:01.398 --> 27:06.034
Even though it caused her
to lose funding for her company?

27:06.069 --> 27:08.303
I allowed myself to get
too personally invested

27:08.338 --> 27:10.071
in Emma Cox.

27:10.107 --> 27:11.373
Hmm. I'm sure there are a lot

27:11.408 --> 27:13.441
of aspiring journalists
watching right now

27:13.477 --> 27:15.210
who appreciate your candor.

27:15.245 --> 27:17.045
Well, there you have it.
Setting the record straight,

27:17.080 --> 27:19.047
that's Jane Sloan. We'll be right back

27:19.082 --> 27:20.148
- to meet New York's...
- I'm sorry,

27:20.183 --> 27:21.983
if I could just say...

27:22.019 --> 27:24.452
Um...

27:24.488 --> 27:28.223
I do think that Emma Cox
is making great strides for women.

27:28.258 --> 27:30.325
She is revolutionizing feminine hygiene.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.094
Her cups are eco-friendly
and affordable.

27:33.130 --> 27:34.462
Okay, are... are you saying...

27:34.498 --> 27:37.432
I'm saying that she made one mistake:

27:37.467 --> 27:42.203
not recognizing the sanitary conditions
needed for her product.

27:42.239 --> 27:44.105
But people make mistakes.

27:44.141 --> 27:46.241
And if they're good people,
they course-correct.

27:46.276 --> 27:48.410
Which Emma did,
when she made new disposable cups

27:48.445 --> 27:50.412
for less optimal conditions.

27:50.447 --> 27:54.316
So, "Incite" was factually inaccurate.

27:57.287 --> 28:00.355
I think that we're all so quick
to take each other down,

28:00.390 --> 28:03.992
to find someone to blame.

28:04.027 --> 28:06.061
"Incite" is not all right or all wrong,

28:06.096 --> 28:09.164
just like Emma Cox is not
all good or all bad.

28:09.199 --> 28:11.132
And when we sensationalize people

28:11.168 --> 28:15.303
for the purpose of getting more eyes
on a story, that story gets lost.

28:15.339 --> 28:17.038
Okay, then.

28:17.074 --> 28:19.140
Something for all of us to think about.

28:19.176 --> 28:21.076
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

28:21.111 --> 28:22.310
We'll be right back.

28:22.346 --> 28:24.279
And, we're clear.

28:24.314 --> 28:26.047
That was great.

28:36.027 --> 28:38.061
This guy needs to relax.

28:38.096 --> 28:39.295
What do you think?

28:41.266 --> 28:43.132
How's it going?

28:43.168 --> 28:44.934
I don't feel like myself at all.

28:44.970 --> 28:47.070
I know exactly what you mean.

28:47.105 --> 28:49.906
You're on display. You're being judged.

28:49.941 --> 28:51.074
I don't know about that.

28:51.109 --> 28:52.208
It's not a good feeling.

28:52.243 --> 28:56.112
Red!

28:56.147 --> 28:57.347
What the hell is going on?

28:57.382 --> 28:59.182
Okay, you can't take
simple measurements,

28:59.217 --> 29:00.917
you can't fix a guy's tie,

29:00.952 --> 29:02.151
and that guy looks
more uncomfortable now

29:02.187 --> 29:03.286
than when I asked you to talk to him.

29:03.321 --> 29:05.989
Oliver. Let me handle this.

29:14.099 --> 29:16.132
- What's wrong?
- Um...

29:16.167 --> 29:19.335
some of the assistants found out
about me and Alex.

29:19.371 --> 29:22.171
And you went through the
proper HR channel, so...

29:22.207 --> 29:24.874
No, I know. We're not together.

29:24.909 --> 29:26.943
Not since you caught
us in the stairwell.

29:26.978 --> 29:28.978
Oh.

29:29.014 --> 29:31.914
Okay, um...

29:31.950 --> 29:33.950
so what's the problem?

29:35.954 --> 29:38.021
When the assistants found out,

29:38.056 --> 29:40.597
they started to talk
about Alex giving me

29:40.625 --> 29:43.159
preferential treatment.

29:43.194 --> 29:45.962
That's not why I was
getting the assignments.

29:45.997 --> 29:48.231
- I know that.
- No, of course not.

29:48.266 --> 29:52.168
But then Oliver assigned
me this photo shoot.

29:52.203 --> 29:54.037
He could have picked anybody,

29:54.072 --> 29:57.974
and he chose me because he thinks
that I work well with men.

29:59.344 --> 30:02.979
I felt people in the office
judging me for that.

30:03.014 --> 30:06.049
And I started to second-guess

30:06.084 --> 30:09.185
how I carry myself, and how I...

30:09.220 --> 30:11.220
- use my sexuality...
- Sutton.

30:11.256 --> 30:14.023
You are a people person.

30:14.059 --> 30:16.959
And men are people.

30:17.438 --> 30:19.962
It's that simple.

30:19.998 --> 30:21.330
It's just with everything
that's been going on lately...

30:21.366 --> 30:23.266
Yes, it is undoubtedly...

30:23.301 --> 30:25.935
a very complicated time
for men and women

30:25.970 --> 30:27.403
in the workplace.

30:27.439 --> 30:29.238
I mean, as stories continue to come out,

30:29.274 --> 30:32.942
we're all checking ourselves,
but we cannot lose sight

30:32.977 --> 30:34.310
of who we truly are.

30:34.345 --> 30:39.082
And we cannot dim our light
that makes us special.

30:39.117 --> 30:42.051
You have a magnetic personality, Sutton.

30:42.087 --> 30:44.087
That is a good thing.

30:45.858 --> 30:48.124
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

30:48.159 --> 30:50.059
Okay.

30:50.195 --> 30:52.295
Okay.

30:52.330 --> 30:55.064
Now, you get back out there,

30:55.100 --> 30:57.300
and make that person...

30:58.880 --> 31:00.069
...photogenic, please.

31:00.105 --> 31:01.938
I'm on it.

31:04.175 --> 31:06.309
Okay, Ben. You want to finish this up,

31:06.344 --> 31:08.077
I'm here to help you make that happen.

31:08.113 --> 31:10.246
- Let's talk, just me and you.
- Okay.

31:10.281 --> 31:11.347
Okay.

31:11.382 --> 31:13.349
Question number one:

31:13.384 --> 31:14.984
why are you doing this?

31:15.019 --> 31:16.285
It's good press for the clinic.

31:16.321 --> 31:19.088
Mm-hmm. So is taking out an ad.

31:19.124 --> 31:20.289
What are you not telling me?

31:20.325 --> 31:22.024
Did you lose a bet?

31:22.060 --> 31:24.093
- I don't gamble.
- Really?

31:24.129 --> 31:25.928
But if you must know,
I have a list of things

31:25.964 --> 31:28.064
- that make me uncomfortable.
- A list.

31:28.099 --> 31:30.366
So what, like a reverse bucket list?

31:30.401 --> 31:32.201
Mm-hmm. Being photographed

31:32.237 --> 31:33.402
- is one of them.
- Okay.

31:33.438 --> 31:36.944
- So you enjoy being uncomfortable.
- No, I hate it.

31:37.242 --> 31:39.375
But it reminds me that I'm alive, so...

31:39.410 --> 31:42.178
Alive and uncomfortable?

31:42.213 --> 31:44.380
That sounds terrible.

31:44.415 --> 31:46.315
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yes!

31:46.351 --> 31:48.184
That is so weird.

31:48.219 --> 31:49.285
I'm just kidding.

31:51.256 --> 31:52.989
That's it. All right.

31:53.024 --> 31:55.224
Got it. Next.

31:58.229 --> 32:00.930
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Of course.

32:00.965 --> 32:02.198
Everything okay?

32:02.233 --> 32:04.000
Yeah.

32:04.035 --> 32:06.002
Yep.

32:06.037 --> 32:08.337
What is it?

32:08.373 --> 32:11.007
Why are we...

32:11.042 --> 32:13.309
so against labeling ourselves?

32:16.080 --> 32:19.348
Uh, well, I guess it's because
your mother and I, we feel that, um,

32:19.384 --> 32:24.053
it's what's on the inside that matters.

32:24.088 --> 32:27.356
Right, but...

32:27.392 --> 32:29.292
I kind of think it's more than that.

32:33.331 --> 32:36.933
The other night, you asked me...

32:36.968 --> 32:40.336
about Adena's parents.

32:40.371 --> 32:43.306
So what about your parents, Dad?

32:43.341 --> 32:46.209
I mean I know everything
about grandma and grandpa.

32:46.244 --> 32:48.177
But...

32:48.213 --> 32:52.114
I don't know anything
about Dad's side of the family.

32:52.150 --> 32:55.084
So why is that?

33:00.258 --> 33:03.059
My childhood was a lot different
from yours, Kat.

33:03.094 --> 33:05.127
I grew up with blacks
on one side of the city

33:05.163 --> 33:07.029
and whites on the other.

33:07.065 --> 33:09.031
And the label of race?

33:09.067 --> 33:12.335
We didn't want that for you.

33:12.370 --> 33:16.239
And I don't think we did such a bad job.

33:16.274 --> 33:19.041
You're confident. You're successful.

33:19.077 --> 33:22.345
Everything you guys are saying...

33:22.380 --> 33:24.046
kind of just feels like a way to avoid

33:24.082 --> 33:27.917
really talking about it, and I'm trying
to understand why.

33:29.020 --> 33:31.087
Maybe it's my fault.

33:34.225 --> 33:36.259
When you were little,

33:36.294 --> 33:39.028
and I would take you to the park,

33:39.063 --> 33:41.998
people assumed you
weren't biologically mine.

33:45.003 --> 33:49.405
Maybe I avoided labels because
I just wanted to be your mom.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.308
I didn't want to be your white mom.

33:59.050 --> 34:02.251
Sweetheart...

34:02.287 --> 34:04.287
if we ever made you feel

34:04.322 --> 34:07.123
that you cannot take
ownership of who you are...

34:10.061 --> 34:11.327
that was not our intention.

34:15.099 --> 34:17.900
You're a grown woman.

34:17.936 --> 34:19.235
You're beautiful,

34:19.270 --> 34:22.237
smart, strong...

34:24.599 --> 34:26.275
These are your choices to make.

34:26.311 --> 34:27.944
Not ours.

34:33.351 --> 34:35.150
Nice work today, Red.

34:35.186 --> 34:37.920
Good to have you back.

34:41.391 --> 34:44.092
Hey, Jane. How'd it go?

34:44.128 --> 34:45.360
<i>Well, I went off script,</i>

34:45.396 --> 34:47.964
<i>so I'm not entirely sure.</i>

34:47.998 --> 34:51.132
But I feel good about it,
so that's something.

34:51.168 --> 34:53.235
- How was the shoot?
- You know what?

34:53.271 --> 34:56.205
I love men. And men love me.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.207
And there's nothing wrong with that.

34:58.242 --> 35:00.109
Well, that's cause for celebration.

35:00.144 --> 35:03.079
- Should we get drinks?
- You read my mind.

35:03.114 --> 35:05.014
There's just one thing
I have to do first.

35:05.049 --> 35:06.349
Kay.

35:08.987 --> 35:10.252
Hey, Mitzi.

35:10.288 --> 35:13.122
So this slut-shaming thing you're doing.

35:13.157 --> 35:14.357
- It's got to stop.
- I wasn't...

35:14.392 --> 35:16.025
You were.

35:16.060 --> 35:20.029
I know it, and, unfortunately,
a few of the assistants also know it.

35:20.064 --> 35:21.364
But we don't tear each other down.

35:21.399 --> 35:23.132
Not as women.

35:23.167 --> 35:25.334
And definitely not
as women of "Scarlet."

35:25.370 --> 35:27.937
If you want some competition,
I'm totally up for that,

35:27.972 --> 35:29.305
but it has to be based
on merit and talent,

35:29.340 --> 35:32.041
and not petty gossip.

35:32.076 --> 35:34.043
- Got it?
- Got it.

35:34.078 --> 35:36.912
Cool. Hey, guys!

35:36.948 --> 35:38.247
- Who wants to get a drink?
- Let's do it.

35:38.282 --> 35:41.384
- Yeah.
- Is that on your list?

35:51.115 --> 35:52.199
Cheers!

35:55.171 --> 35:57.204
Okay, how great
did everybody feel today?

35:57.240 --> 35:59.040
- Awesome.
- You looked great.

35:59.075 --> 36:01.042
You looked great, you looked great,

36:01.077 --> 36:03.044
- and you looked great.
- Well, thank you.

36:03.079 --> 36:05.846
Come here.

36:05.882 --> 36:08.983
There's somebody that
I want you to meet.

36:09.018 --> 36:10.217
- Hi.
- Hi, Jane.

36:10.253 --> 36:12.186
This is Ben. Ben, this is Jane.

36:12.221 --> 36:13.854
Oh, my God!

36:13.890 --> 36:15.056
You guys are both great people,

36:15.091 --> 36:17.858
who like to make really
weird to-do lists.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.880
Thank you for the awkward introduction.

36:20.931 --> 36:24.098
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

36:25.902 --> 36:27.802
Uh, so...

36:27.837 --> 36:29.136
- Drinks.
- Yeah.

36:33.276 --> 36:35.142
Hello.

36:35.178 --> 36:37.144
Do you want to talk?

36:37.180 --> 36:39.246
Yeah, but not right now.

36:39.282 --> 36:41.582
Right now, I want to drink.

36:41.635 --> 36:44.151
I can make that happen. Bartender!

36:45.288 --> 36:47.822
- Tequila or tequila?
- Tequila.

36:48.215 --> 36:49.256
Thank you.

Hey.

Hey, morning.

37:30.099 --> 37:31.832
You going to work already?

37:31.868 --> 37:33.834
Yeah, I, uh...

37:33.870 --> 37:37.004
promised Jacqueline I'd have
my bio in first thing, so...

37:39.075 --> 37:42.143
These things can be hard to look at.

37:42.178 --> 37:44.845
Yeah...

37:44.881 --> 37:49.083
and especially when you've been raised
with rose-colored glasses.

37:49.118 --> 37:50.851
Your parents...

37:50.887 --> 37:54.822
they did what they believed
was best for you at the time.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.293
Yeah, I know.

38:01.642 --> 38:06.901
But I also know that I chose
to keep those glasses on.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.803
Long after I moved out.

38:08.838 --> 38:11.806
Kat, it's...

38:11.841 --> 38:13.841
it's okay.

38:16.813 --> 38:17.982
Come here.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.128
_

38:48.643 --> 38:51.212
Hey. Thanks.

38:52.529 --> 38:54.849
So what did you choose?

38:54.884 --> 39:00.020
I am "Scarlet" magazine's
first black female department head.

39:00.056 --> 39:01.440
Sounds impressive.

39:03.826 --> 39:06.093
And I'm so proud to be biracial.

39:06.129 --> 39:08.028
But...

39:08.064 --> 39:13.134
for right now, it feels important
to embrace this part of myself.

39:15.037 --> 39:18.038
Hold that!

39:18.074 --> 39:20.040
Thanks. Oh, good morning, Richard.

39:20.076 --> 39:21.775
Jacqueline.

39:21.811 --> 39:23.878
- You get a chance to meet Cleo?
- I did.

39:23.913 --> 39:25.045
And...

39:25.081 --> 39:28.215
She won't be joining our poker night,
if that's what you're asking.

39:28.251 --> 39:30.784
But I think she'll be
an asset to the board.

39:30.820 --> 39:33.053
And a fresh perspective.

39:34.857 --> 39:36.223
Still wish you were
riding to the top with me.

39:36.259 --> 39:38.792
Maybe one day, Richard. Not yet.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.909
<i>Hi, Jacqueline, it's Cleo.</i>

39:54.944 --> 39:57.845
<i>I just saw the layout
for next month's issue.</i>

39:57.880 --> 39:59.980
<i>It's gorgeous. Had a few thoughts.</i>

40:00.016 --> 40:01.815
<i>Call me, let's discuss.</i>

40:07.190 --> 40:08.189
- Victoria?
- Just the person

40:08.224 --> 40:10.824
I wanted to see. Have a seat.

40:12.094 --> 40:13.894
We all make mistakes.

40:13.930 --> 40:15.996
The important thing is
that we learn from them.

40:16.460 --> 40:17.865
Yes, uh,

40:17.900 --> 40:21.202
that's exactly what I was going for
with my angle on Emma Cox.

40:21.237 --> 40:23.170
I made a mistake recently...

40:23.206 --> 40:26.073
when I thought you would
be a good fit for "Incite."

40:26.781 --> 40:28.209
But I...

40:28.244 --> 40:30.110
It was... it was a good interview, I...

40:30.146 --> 40:33.214
I did what you said.
I hit all my talking points.

40:33.249 --> 40:36.884
Jane, you went on television
to represent "Incite."

40:36.919 --> 40:38.219
- You made it about yourself.
- No, I...

40:38.254 --> 40:39.286
I was trying to make a point...

40:39.322 --> 40:41.055
Jane. Stop.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.890
You're fired.
