00:02.369 --> 00:04.064
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.237 --> 00:06.728
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.906 --> 00:08.771
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.739
Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.037
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.

00:13.213 --> 00:15.545
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.

00:15.782 --> 00:18.842
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel
so she can give it to John.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.544
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take the spell off.

00:26.259 --> 00:29.387
You took a risk with Damon.
How'd you know he would give it to me?

00:29.562 --> 00:30.961
Because he's in love with you.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.699
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
It wasn't right.

00:38.104 --> 00:40.629
But when Elena finds out...

00:41.641 --> 00:43.199
...she's never gonna forgive me.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.474
Ow. This dress hurts.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.635
Suck it in, baby.

01:26.453 --> 01:29.286
Timberwolves! Timberwolves! Go Big Red!

01:29.456 --> 01:31.981
No, no, no. This lineup is all wrong.

01:32.158 --> 01:34.854
The marching band is
in front of the historical society.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.495
Matt, time to get on your float.

01:36.663 --> 01:40.622
Boys, I asked you to put the chairs
on the Founder's float.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.898
Ladies, time to get on your float.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.829
Look at you, all retro.

01:47.006 --> 01:49.270
- What are you doing here?
- Why wouldn't I be here?

01:50.477 --> 01:56.211
Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention,
Isobel's gone and it's Founder's Day.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.816
I'm here to eat cotton candy
and steal your girl.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.820
- Don't start with me.
- Oh, you started it, Stefan...

02:02.989 --> 02:06.152
...with that whole "I'm insecure,
leave Elena alone" speech.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.259
I'm still enjoying that.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.362
- As long as you heard it.
- Wait, huh?

02:10.530 --> 02:11.929
What?

02:13.433 --> 02:14.866
You have no sense of humor.

02:15.034 --> 02:18.526
Actually, I just have no sense
of Damon humor.

02:18.938 --> 02:21.498
Damon humor? Hey, look, I get it.

02:21.674 --> 02:25.235
I get it. I'm the better, hotter,
superior choice and you're scared...

02:25.411 --> 02:28.574
...now that Katherine's out of the picture,
I'm gonna turn to Elena.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.717
But don't worry. Elena is not Katherine.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.246
You're right. She's not.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.427
Anna.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.922
Look at you.

03:20.266 --> 03:24.396
Heh. I know, it's stupid, huh?
I'm part of the parade.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.765
But how are you? I've been so worried...

03:28.374 --> 03:30.103
...and I feel awful.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.766
Why?

03:32.011 --> 03:34.571
You didn't kill my mother. Your uncle did.

03:35.448 --> 03:36.745
Are you sure it was him?

03:36.916 --> 03:38.474
Who else would've done it?

03:41.020 --> 03:44.979
He doesn't understand, Anna.
It's who he is. He hates all vampires.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.550
He's just doing what he thinks is right.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.451
Are you defending him?

03:50.330 --> 03:52.298
No. No way.

03:52.665 --> 03:53.962
It's just...

03:54.133 --> 03:56.658
I do understand where he's coming from.

03:56.836 --> 04:01.796
He's convinced all the tomb vampires
want revenge on this town and he's just...

04:02.442 --> 04:04.069
He's trying to protect it.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.402
They do want revenge.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.408
Or at least they did.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.408
But that's why we separated from them.

04:11.584 --> 04:15.350
My mom wasn't after revenge.
She just wanted her life back.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.922
I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.684
You're leaving?

04:23.296 --> 04:25.196
But I've been thinking, you could come.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.424
I could turn you.
You said you wanted me to.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.100
Here.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.564
It's my blood.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.834
If you die with it in your system,
you'll come back.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.435
- Anna...
- I know you.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.136
What it's like for you.

04:41.314 --> 04:46.183
Being alone, always feeling empty inside,
no one to understand.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.613
But when you're a vampire,
you don't have to feel that way.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.723
You can shut it off.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.324
I can show you how.

04:57.664 --> 05:00.064
I wanted to. I did.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.963
But I don't think I can.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.998
I'm sorry.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.840
John?

05:18.418 --> 05:19.908
Is that even possible?

05:20.520 --> 05:23.751
Well, there's no proof, but he dated Isobel
when she was a teenager.

05:23.923 --> 05:26.551
He brought her to your dad's office
for the delivery.

05:26.726 --> 05:30.856
My whole life
I've never liked this man. L...

05:31.130 --> 05:32.722
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

05:32.899 --> 05:36.391
Wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it
on you in some inappropriate way.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.868
No, I'm happy that you told me. I just...

05:40.039 --> 05:42.234
I really hope that it's not true.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.203
What am I supposed to do?

05:45.378 --> 05:50.281
Do I just confront him and say,
"Are you my biological father?"

05:51.384 --> 05:53.352
Well, I guess when you're ready.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.046
I'm never gonna be ready.

05:56.356 --> 06:00.190
Stefan, I have enough problems
with the family that I actually care about.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.988
Jeremy hates me. And why wouldn't he?

06:03.162 --> 06:05.187
My journal gave him
every single reason to.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.992
He's just hurt. He's confused.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.066
He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.396
For taking away his memory,
for lying to him.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.199
He's your brother. He'll forgive you.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.966
Just give him some time.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.404
- Say cheese.
- Ooh, wait.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.638
- Hide your cast. It's not era-appropriate.
- Seriously?

06:22.014 --> 06:23.811
- Yes.
- Okay. All right. Come here.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.610
I want one with Bonnie.

06:27.787 --> 06:28.913
- Okay.
- I can take it.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.483
I'll be on the float.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.820
I said I was sorry.

06:37.263 --> 06:40.164
You made out with his mother
and then you beat him to a pulp.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.325
You're gonna have to do
a little bit better than sorry.

06:45.705 --> 06:46.729
Jeremy.

06:47.607 --> 06:50.576
I was wondering where you were.
You look great.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.735
- You guys did a really great job on the float.
- Go away, Elena.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.882
Jeremy, please.
I don't want it to be like this between us.

06:57.049 --> 06:59.279
Why don't you have Damon
erase my memory again?

06:59.452 --> 07:02.114
Then I could go back
to being your in-the-dark brother.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.848
- Jer, please.
- Just don't.

07:06.559 --> 07:11.019
You can't fix this that easily.
Something like this doesn't just get fixed.

07:18.738 --> 07:22.606
Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Falls
High School Marching Band.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.169
Yeah!

07:33.853 --> 07:36.014
And for a little local history...

07:36.189 --> 07:40.353
...Mr. Saltzman's students have re-created
Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.330
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

07:48.501 --> 07:54.406
...our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court
and their handsome escorts.

08:01.614 --> 08:05.414
This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.084
Aren't they beautiful?

08:28.708 --> 08:29.732
What do you want?

08:30.743 --> 08:32.768
Just watching the parade.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.941
- Where you going?
- Away from you.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.105
- I wanna say something.
- Leave me alone.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.443
Thank you.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.187
The device that Emily spelled
could've killed me.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.789
I don't take what you did lightly...

08:45.358 --> 08:46.416
...so thank you.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.959
- I did it for Elena.
- I know that, but I'm still very grateful.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.626
And I owe you.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.473
Enjoy the parade.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.476
Oh, there they are. Look.

09:06.646 --> 09:10.207
Let's cheer for
the Mystic Falls High School football team.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.444
All right. Let's show
them our support, everybody.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.489
This is the key.

09:23.663 --> 09:26.154
Once inserted,
the device will be activated.

09:26.332 --> 09:29.267
It will work only once
for an estimated time of five minutes.

09:29.602 --> 09:30.967
Yeah, so how does it work?

09:31.270 --> 09:33.704
It's a high-pitched frequency
that humans can't hear.

09:33.873 --> 09:38.333
Any vampire within a five-block radius
will be incapacitated, exposing them.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.674
At that time, the sheriff's deputies
will inject them with vervain...

09:41.847 --> 09:44.509
...and bring them here,
where we'll finish them off.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.743
- They're attacking tonight?
- I had a source.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.845
One of the vampires from the tomb
confirmed the attack.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.956
Everybody listen up.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.425
The plan stays the same.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.255
We wait till the fireworks start.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.954
Until then, we blend in.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.793
Stay part of the celebration.
They'll never see us coming.

10:01.968 --> 10:05.597
They want revenge
for what our ancestors did in 1864.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.102
Which makes us their targets.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.207
This area here is the stage.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.639
This is where the founding families
are gonna be.

10:13.713 --> 10:14.737
Any questions?

10:14.914 --> 10:19.146
Taking an enormous risk.
Talking about our families, John.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.183
Anna.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.519
What are you doing here?

10:27.159 --> 10:30.492
This is the only way.
Draw them out and kill them.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.358
All of them.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.413
I like you better like this.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.918
Period look, it didn't suit you.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.214
Is that an insult?

10:59.425 --> 11:03.418
Actually, Elena,
it is a compliment of the highest order.

11:05.931 --> 11:10.732
Look, I know Stefan is worried
about our friendship.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.330
Did he mention something to you too?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.701
- No. Did he mention something to you?
- No.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.566
Nothing worth repeating.

11:18.477 --> 11:22.004
You should stop with the flirty comments
and that eye thing that you do.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.479
What eye thing?

11:26.385 --> 11:27.716
Hm.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.513
Don't make me regret being your friend.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.757
Okay?

11:46.038 --> 11:48.063
I don't believe that we can't fix this.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.902
I lied. I was wrong.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.476
But you're my brother, Jer.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.136
And I love you and I have to fix it.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.282
So just tell me, what can I do?

12:01.153 --> 12:02.950
You can go to hell, Elena.

12:21.774 --> 12:25.676
I have so many emotions,
but I don't have any way to express them.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.710
- Being a teenager is so hard.
- Dick.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.075
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.047
And from now on,
don't talk to your sister that way either.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.380
You're gonna kill me
because I hurt Elena?

12:35.554 --> 12:36.987
Cut her some slack.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.551
- She erased my memories.
- No. I did.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.921
She was protecting you.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.488
That wasn't her call to make.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.863
- Let go before I cause a scene.
- You'd be unconscious...

12:53.038 --> 12:55.302
...before you even got a word out.
- Let him go.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.506
You all right?

12:59.678 --> 13:01.077
Yeah.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.678
What my brother is trying to say
is don't blame Elena for this.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.217
Damon turned Vicki.

13:10.089 --> 13:11.147
I killed her.

13:11.857 --> 13:16.055
She was a threat to you
and she was a threat to your sister.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.021
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.562
Shouldn't have made me forget.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.872
- Good cop, bad cop. I like it.
- What are you doing?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.670
- He was a punk.
- Elena's relationship with her brother...

13:32.845 --> 13:37.077
...is none of your business. Stay out of it.
- There's only one do-gooder role available.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.012
Oh, my bad. I'm sorry.

13:39.185 --> 13:42.018
We both know you're not doing this
for the right reasons.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.082
See? There you go
with that little jealousy act again.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.418
It just...
What are the right reasons, Stefan?

13:47.593 --> 13:49.424
- Enlighten me, please.
- See, Damon...

13:49.595 --> 13:53.656
...it's only real when it comes
from your desire to do the right thing.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.857
For nothing in return.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.058
- Right.
- And I know...

13:56.235 --> 13:58.601
...that is an entirely foreign concept
to you.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.899
I completely understand
how you wouldn't get it.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.838
You wanna use our town as bait?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.545
It's too dangerous. It's insane.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.878
We've gone over the plans
with your deputies. They're all on board.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.619
- You've gone behind me?
- We knew this is how you'd react.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.417
- Our children are here.
- Liz, we need to do this.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.659
We have no choice.
This is the reason for the secret council.

14:22.828 --> 14:26.924
Our founding fathers created
the secret council for just this purpose.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.663
I'm the sheriff and it's my call...

14:35.841 --> 14:36.865
...and I say no.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.979
Richard, let me speak
to the sheriff alone.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.882
John, you're not thinking clearly.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.545
I'm not gonna change my mind
about this.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.608
You're still around?

15:24.023 --> 15:25.854
There's something you need to know.

15:26.025 --> 15:29.051
The vampires from the tomb
are planning an attack tonight.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.322
- How do you know?
- I went to them.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.158
They think I'm with them. I'm not.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.697
They want the founding families dead.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.138
When is this supposed to happen?

15:40.806 --> 15:42.501
When the fireworks start.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.002
John Gilbert wants to use that invention
on them.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.774
- We can't be here.
- Doesn't work. It's been deactivated.

15:51.083 --> 15:54.143
- Then a lot of people are gonna die.
- Where are they right now?

15:55.154 --> 15:56.951
They're already here, Damon.

15:59.024 --> 16:02.221
Remember, we don't know which of them
ingests vervain.

16:02.394 --> 16:06.228
It's not about the feed.
It's about the kill.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.297
You know what to do.

16:16.875 --> 16:17.933
- Ric.
- Yeah.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.372
Come here.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.843
You keep those nifty vamp weapons
in the car?

16:22.014 --> 16:23.140
Yeah. Why do you ask?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.340
This square is crawling
with tomb vampires.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.144
We might need a stake or two.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.616
- Yeah. Got it.
- Go.

16:28.787 --> 16:31.153
I know. Can you imagine?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.857
Hey.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.790
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.362
Fifteen words or less,
tomb vamps are here.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.524
Founding families are the target.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.362
- Get her out of here. Now.
- Wait. Where are you going?

16:44.536 --> 16:47.096
- That's more than 15 words, Stefan.
- Wait.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.364
Jeremy's out here.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.343
Let's go find him. Come on.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.178
There was this time, freshman year...

16:59.351 --> 17:03.515
...when Bonnie and I were in a fight and
we swore that we would never talk again.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.951
Caroline, give it a rest.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.589
Thanks.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.929
What are you doing here?
I told you to go home.

17:19.104 --> 17:22.005
- I decided not to.
- Lf I tell you to do something, you do it.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.699
- Get off me.
- Mayor. Is everything okay?

17:29.715 --> 17:32.240
Please, Tyler.
I need you to go home. Now.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.746
- Take your friends with you.
- Wait. Why? What's going on?

17:38.023 --> 17:39.456
I can't explain.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.124
All of you need to get home now.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.994
Please.

17:44.930 --> 17:45.954
Yeah, okay.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.298
Here.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.929
Take my car. It's out back.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.864
Caroline, Matt, go with him.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.570
Come on.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.840
Anna, my uncle could see you.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.281
I don't care about that.

18:08.454 --> 18:09.648
I needed to find you.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.179
Come here.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.789
For 150 years...

18:16.962 --> 18:21.592
...Mystic Falls has been the kind of town
that everybody wants to call home.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.464
Safe, prosperous, welcoming.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.805
And we have the founders
to thank for that.

18:30.142 --> 18:33.634
That's why I'd like to dedicate
this evening's fireworks display...

18:33.812 --> 18:35.939
...to their legacy.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.686
Get into position.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.556
Enjoy the show.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.143
Stay close, dear.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.422
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.769
Do you have any idea what you've done?

19:39.945 --> 19:42.004
Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.255
Stefan? What's going on?
What's happening?

19:53.659 --> 19:55.183
- My head.
- What?

19:56.461 --> 19:58.156
My head.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.629
Anna? Anna, what's wrong? Anna?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.695
- Please make it stop.
- What's happening?

20:19.618 --> 20:20.642
What the hell is that?

20:21.019 --> 20:22.145
What's the matter?

20:22.321 --> 20:24.221
- That noise.
- Wait. What noise?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.426
- Oh!
- Whoa.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.825
- Tyler? Tyler!
- Dude, hey!

20:33.966 --> 20:35.831
- Caroline, the wheel!
- Tyler!

20:49.514 --> 20:50.947
Hey. I got this one.

20:51.116 --> 20:53.846
There's another one over there.
Take this. Go. Go. Go.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.610
Get up.

20:57.022 --> 21:00.014
- He just dropped.
- Yeah, he's not the only one.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.922
Cops are grabbing everyone who's down.
Injecting vervain.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.562
- What?
- Yeah.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.024
They're rounding up the vampires.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.032
Please help him. He just went down.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.229
Is that the mayor?

21:14.473 --> 21:16.907
- Richard.
- Is he all right?

21:18.577 --> 21:20.169
My head. Jeremy.

21:20.912 --> 21:21.936
Hey, I got one.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.309
Hey, what are you doing?

21:25.517 --> 21:28.008
- What are you doing? Leave her alone.
- All right.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.688
- What are you doing? Leave her alone!
- Hey.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.216
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Leave her alone! Anna!

22:00.218 --> 22:01.276
The device is done.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.944
The only thing
keeping them down is the vervain.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.317
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.824
Anna.

22:18.603 --> 22:20.366
You head up. I'll take it from here.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.217
Please.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.278
No.

23:24.603 --> 23:27.265
- You okay?
- It was like needles were piercing my skull.

23:27.439 --> 23:28.736
And then it just stopped.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.269
I saw at least five vampires go down.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.406
They're taking them
to your family's old building.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.211
It's the Gilbert device.

23:37.382 --> 23:38.406
It has to be.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.278
But how did he get it to work?

23:40.452 --> 23:41.680
Bonnie unspelled it.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.278
Or maybe she didn't.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.187
She did. We saw her do it.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.524
No. He's right. Think about it.

23:48.293 --> 23:50.818
We asked Bonnie
to deactivate a device...

23:50.996 --> 23:53.430
...that could protect people
against vampires.

23:53.598 --> 23:54.758
So we could protect you.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.867
And Damon. Vampires.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.162
- Where's Damon?
- I don't know.

24:01.339 --> 24:03.204
I haven't seen him since this started.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.877
- Can you get my brother? Take him home?
- Of course.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.376
Let's go.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.951
- Liz. You okay? What is going on?
- There's a key in my belt.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.248
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.756
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Something's happened to Richard.

24:21.927 --> 24:23.417
- They took him.
- Who took him?

24:23.595 --> 24:24.721
Your deputies.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.827
I don't understand. He's not a vampire.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.958
Let's go.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.166
Mayor.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.143
- Is that you?
- What are you doing here?

24:42.948 --> 24:44.142
I'm a vampire.

24:45.851 --> 24:47.341
What is your excuse?

24:49.154 --> 24:50.849
No, really.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.389
The vervain didn't affect you.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.416
You're not a vampire.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.424
What the hell are you?

24:59.931 --> 25:01.159
Mayor Lockwood.

25:05.470 --> 25:07.335
You okay?
Your side took the biggest hit.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.497
- I'm fine.
- No, they need to check you out.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.666
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
They're helping Tyler.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.937
Pulse is steadying.

25:15.113 --> 25:16.273
All right.

25:22.487 --> 25:23.511
What the hell?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.349
What? What's wrong?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.718
The eyes.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.934
- What happened?
- Dude, don't scare me like that.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.233
Hey. She needs some help over here.

25:40.405 --> 25:41.736
Caroline.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.535
- Over here. Caroline.
- There. Get that one.

25:44.809 --> 25:47.801
Caroline, hey. Wake up.
We're gonna get you home. Wake up, Car.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.871
Wait, wait, wait.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.310
I can hear them.

25:53.785 --> 25:55.377
- The building is on fire.
- What?

25:55.554 --> 25:56.816
Building's on fire.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.827
Where is Damon?

26:08.767 --> 26:11.930
With the rest of them,
where he should be.

26:12.103 --> 26:13.161
It's over for Damon.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.598
You're crazy.

26:16.775 --> 26:20.506
Why? Because I'm doing
what should've been done 145 years ago?

26:20.879 --> 26:22.744
This is the right thing, Elena.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.509
Go ahead. You won't make it out.

26:28.787 --> 26:31.722
You'll save me the trouble
of killing you myself.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.688
You know the building well.
Is there another entrance in?

26:35.860 --> 26:38.158
Utility door. There's one around the side.

26:40.699 --> 26:43.827
One more step and I'll alert those deputies
they missed a vampire.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.031
I'm asking you not to.

26:46.204 --> 26:48.764
That doesn't mean anything to me.

26:49.874 --> 26:52.365
As my father, it should.

27:00.085 --> 27:01.279
You know.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.152
I wasn't sure.

27:04.322 --> 27:05.380
But now I am.

27:12.897 --> 27:15.161
Hey! You can't go in there.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.198
The fire will take you out.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.134
He's my brother, Bonnie.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.571
Stefan!

27:30.715 --> 27:34.173
- Elena, you can't go in there.
- Bonnie, what are you doing?

27:34.352 --> 27:35.376
I'm sorry I lied to you.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.886
I've gotta get in there.

28:11.056 --> 28:14.719
Damon. Come on. Hurry up.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.645
Bonnie.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.245
Bonnie, what is it?
Are they gonna be okay?

28:41.219 --> 28:42.379
Oh, God.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.025
Oh, my God.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.595
Two 10-45s will be treated at county...

29:06.077 --> 29:07.135
The fire is out.

29:07.312 --> 29:10.839
The story is that the building's old wiring
is what caused it.

29:12.784 --> 29:14.479
Did you see where Damon went?

29:14.786 --> 29:16.845
No. He just kind of disappeared.

29:18.123 --> 29:19.681
Figures.

29:23.795 --> 29:26.491
I'm so glad you're okay.

29:28.967 --> 29:31.561
I try so hard...

29:32.203 --> 29:33.500
...to hate him.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.271
I guess it's just pointless.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.801
You care about him.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.910
So do I.

29:47.218 --> 29:49.652
But I love you, Stefan.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.712
And I know
that you're worried about that.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.622
Well, I just...

29:56.828 --> 29:58.728
You know, I know my brother.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.061
But I love you, Stefan.

30:01.232 --> 30:03.462
I know the trouble he can cause...

30:03.635 --> 30:07.366
I love you, Stefan. You.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.817
You have nothing to worry about.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.989
- Okay?
- Yeah.

30:26.691 --> 30:29.387
So l... Jenna called.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.359
Jeremy is home.
I'm just gonna run over to the school...

30:32.530 --> 30:34.691
...to pick up my dress, my clothes,
my stuff...

30:34.866 --> 30:36.390
...and then I'll check on him.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.553
What are you doing here?

31:02.594 --> 31:03.720
Anna's dead.

31:06.297 --> 31:09.027
I figured that once they took her away.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.135
I know you cared about her.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.667
Yeah, I did.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.532
I saw her killed.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.143
I was watching
and all I could think about was...

31:25.817 --> 31:27.944
I wanted to help her.

31:29.354 --> 31:30.582
But I couldn't.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.657
Why are you telling me all this?

31:35.994 --> 31:37.985
I took away your suffering once before.

31:38.162 --> 31:40.255
I can do it again.

31:41.065 --> 31:42.828
But it's your choice.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.101
Look...

31:46.237 --> 31:48.933
...I know you think you took it away...

31:49.707 --> 31:51.607
...but it's still there.

31:52.543 --> 31:57.003
Even if I can't remember why,
I still feel empty.

31:57.548 --> 31:59.106
Alone.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.514
And making me forget won't fix it.

32:05.857 --> 32:08.485
It won't fix what's really wrong.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.959
What I did to Vicki...

32:19.103 --> 32:20.695
...was wrong.

32:22.740 --> 32:23.866
Sorry for my part.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.943
Anna said that vampires
don't have to feel pain.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.450
That they could turn it off
if they shut out their humanity.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.718
That's very true.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.659
Is it easier that way?

32:44.629 --> 32:45.789
Is what easier?

32:46.931 --> 32:48.626
Life.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.324
Life sucks either way, Jeremy.

32:53.771 --> 32:57.036
If you're a vampire, you don't have
to feel bad if you don't want to.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.066
Is that what you did?

33:00.411 --> 33:02.242
I did it for...

33:02.480 --> 33:04.914
I did it for a very long time.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.916
And life was a lot easier.

33:21.699 --> 33:22.723
Hey, man.

33:25.203 --> 33:28.661
I'm so sorry. Look, I don't even know
what happened.

33:30.908 --> 33:32.603
It's okay, man.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.244
She'll be all right.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.013
What's happening? She all right?

33:48.192 --> 33:51.025
There was internal bleeding.
They're taking her into surgery.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.254
What else did they say?
Is she gonna be okay?

33:53.831 --> 33:56.129
They're gonna do everything they can.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.933
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?

34:05.109 --> 34:07.600
I left her a message telling her I was here.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.578
You need to call her.

34:10.415 --> 34:11.438
What is it?

34:13.083 --> 34:14.949
It's your dad.

35:18.049 --> 35:19.448
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

35:19.617 --> 35:23.280
- You just missed Elena.
- I was looking for you, actually.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.114
Oh.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.954
Elena is my best friend.

35:29.093 --> 35:32.961
And because she loves you,
I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.224
I'm grateful, Bonnie.
I hope you know that.

35:35.399 --> 35:39.893
I do. But I hope you know
that things have to change.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.834
Damon has to change.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.335
We both want the same thing.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.238
We both wanna protect the people
we care about.

35:49.413 --> 35:52.780
The difference is, for you,
Damon is one of them.

35:52.950 --> 35:55.748
You saw what I was able to do tonight.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.547
I know who I am now.

35:58.289 --> 36:03.886
And if Damon spills so much
as one drop of innocent blood...

36:04.061 --> 36:06.188
...l'll take him down.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.436
Even if I have to take you with him.

36:16.073 --> 36:18.371
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

36:19.977 --> 36:21.103
Let's hope it doesn't.

36:35.826 --> 36:36.952
What are you doing here?

36:40.198 --> 36:44.032
A failed and feeble attempt
at doing the right thing.

36:45.570 --> 36:46.594
Which was?

36:49.006 --> 36:52.271
It's not important.
Let me take this for you.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.845
Thank you.

37:01.485 --> 37:04.318
You know, I came in this town
wanting to destroy it.

37:04.488 --> 37:05.978
Tonight...

37:06.824 --> 37:09.384
...I found myself wanting to protect it.

37:12.129 --> 37:14.029
How does that happen?

37:15.399 --> 37:17.264
I'm not a hero, Elena.

37:17.435 --> 37:18.697
I don't do good.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.166
It's not in me.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.105
Maybe it is.

37:23.908 --> 37:29.346
No. No, that's reserved
for my brother and you and Bonnie.

37:30.314 --> 37:35.684
Even though she has every reason
to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.

37:35.953 --> 37:38.012
Why do you sound so surprised?

37:38.189 --> 37:39.315
She did it for you.

37:40.858 --> 37:42.689
Which means
somewhere along the way...

37:44.362 --> 37:47.160
...you decided that I was worth saving.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.698
And I wanted to thank you...

37:50.868 --> 37:52.392
...for that.

37:55.339 --> 37:56.499
You're welcome.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.677
Hi.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.214
It's late.

38:46.390 --> 38:47.982
You should probably come inside.

39:02.673 --> 39:03.697
What are you doing?

39:05.209 --> 39:08.178
I don't wanna talk about it.

39:49.353 --> 39:50.377
You scared me.

39:50.654 --> 39:52.246
I'm sorry.

39:57.928 --> 40:00.920
You know, I first met Isobel
when I was a teenager.

40:01.532 --> 40:05.969
I fell in love with her instantly, although
I'm pretty sure she never loved me.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.168
She was special.

40:08.572 --> 40:11.905
Part of why I hate the vampires so much
is because of what she became.

40:13.177 --> 40:15.077
How it ruined her.

40:16.714 --> 40:20.150
And I never would've sent her to Damon
had I known she wanted to turn.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.717
It's my fault.

40:27.491 --> 40:30.756
I'm telling you this because I hope...

40:30.928 --> 40:33.260
...maybe you'd understand.

40:37.234 --> 40:38.326
Thank you.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.195
Can I help?

40:44.241 --> 40:45.731
Sure.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.579
Katherine?

40:55.186 --> 40:57.347
Hello, John. Goodbye, John.

41:00.591 --> 41:01.717
I looked everywhere.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.956
Yeah. Someone definitely took my stuff.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.297
I gotta check on Jeremy
before I go to the hospital.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.230
Can you meet me there?

41:11.602 --> 41:12.796
Okay.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.801
I love you, Stefan.

41:20.344 --> 41:23.074
Jeremy? Are you up?
