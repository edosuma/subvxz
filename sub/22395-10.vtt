<i>Commander mouse,
you are clear for re-entry.</i>

00:11.583 --> 00:13.959
Roger.
See you back on earth.

00:13.959 --> 00:17.875
Initiating landing protocol
in t-minus three minutes.

00:18.875 --> 00:21.917
Autopilot, engaged.

00:21.917 --> 00:23.583
Huh?

00:25.709 --> 00:26.875
You need to go outside?

00:27.667 --> 00:29.750
Oh no, buddy.
Now's not the time.

00:32.417 --> 00:33.959
Well, just use the space John.

00:36.834 --> 00:37.792
Or not.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.959
We'll do it. But you
have to make it quick.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.875
Whoa, boy!

00:45.875 --> 00:48.291
We don't want to get caught
in that gravity well.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.333
Excuse us.

01:08.291 --> 01:09.625
Oh! Right.
Hehehe.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.291
<i>Hey!
Get that dog off my lawn!</i>

01:16.291 --> 01:18.667
Wha... hehe.
Sorry. C'mon, pluto.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.792
Pluto?
Pluto!

01:21.291 --> 01:22.667
You called?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.875
Uh-huh.
My dog, pluto.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.625
Pluto, where are you?

01:31.709 --> 01:33.333
Pluto?
Out of the trash, boy!

01:33.625 --> 01:35.792
We're running out of time.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.750
Hmm...

01:38.750 --> 01:40.875
Aha!
Here, boy, fetch!

01:40.875 --> 01:42.375
Arf!

01:45.375 --> 01:46.917
Haha.
Here's your treat!

01:48.000 --> 01:49.750
Now, back to the ship.

01:53.917 --> 01:56.291
Oh no, pluto, stay!

01:57.458 --> 01:58.458
Ahh!

02:07.750 --> 02:09.417
Ahhh.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.333
Ah! Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Ah!

02:28.625 --> 02:31.917
<i>Re-entry sequence engaging in 15, 14...</i>

02:31.917 --> 02:34.834
Oh no!
We'll never make it back now!

02:34.834 --> 02:37.709
We'll be lost in space forever!

02:44.333 --> 02:46.500
Hmm. It's our only hope.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.250
Here, boy.

02:51.667 --> 02:52.667
Fetch!

02:59.542 --> 03:02.750
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

03:02.750 --> 03:04.959
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

03:05.792 --> 03:10.291
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

03:19.583 --> 03:21.125
Welcome back, commander mouse.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.792
After such a long space
mission, you must be relieved.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.917
Haha. Uh, not yet.
But I will be!
