09:07.680 --> 09:08.981
- He's right here.
I found him!

09:09.048 --> 09:10.917
Oh, buddy, thank goodness
you're safe.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.485
- Irving, that's not our son.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.719
- Oh, okay. Fair enough.

09:13.786 --> 09:14.987
{\an1}That's on me.
Honest mistake.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.822
- I think he went this way.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.158
- Ugh! Ow. Ow. Ugh.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.593
- Oh, there you are.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.495
- [gasps]
I told you not to follow me!

09:22.561 --> 09:24.897
This is my punishment!

09:24.964 --> 09:27.633
- Sweetie, this is really
excessive.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.136
- [quick breathing]

09:30.202 --> 09:32.471

[screams]

09:32.538 --> 09:34.707
Ugh! No!

[screams]

09:36.742 --> 09:38.878
[both panting]

09:38.945 --> 09:42.448
- We should put him in sports.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.117
- [grunting]

09:45.184 --> 09:46.118
Huh?

09:46.185 --> 09:47.119

09:47.186 --> 09:49.622
Ah! Lemon plant!

09:49.689 --> 09:52.625
[struggling]

09:52.692 --> 09:54.560
- Why are you doing this?

09:54.627 --> 09:56.329
Is this about the plate?

09:56.395 --> 09:58.965
- Everything is about the plate!

09:59.031 --> 10:02.134
I tried to make up for it,
but I still feel bad.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.003
I'll climb to the top
of this tree,

10:04.070 --> 10:05.571
then I'll learn my lesson.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.106
- Sweetie, listen to me.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.343
You need to do something
much harder than that.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.579
You need to forgive yourself.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.581
- Forgive...myself?

10:15.648 --> 10:17.049
- People make mistakes.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.618
You just have to live with it
and let it go.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.821
- Just let it go.

10:23.889 --> 10:26.525
- What's up, man?

10:26.592 --> 10:27.827
- Sorry, plate.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.029
I never meant
to smash you to bits.

10:30.096 --> 10:32.832
But I have to move on
with my life now.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.334
I promise,
I'll never forget you

10:35.401 --> 10:37.503
or what you've taught me.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.338
- Good-bye!

10:39.405 --> 10:41.307
Bye, Harvey!

10:41.374 --> 10:43.242
You take care of yourself.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.511
Be good, Harvey.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.014

10:54.420 --> 10:56.655

11:00.292 --> 11:03.863
And if this one breaks,
it's no big deal, okay?

11:03.929 --> 11:05.731
- Oh, this one won't break.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.633
Thanks for helping me
set this up, guys.

it's not as magnificent

12:58.878 --> 13:01.046

are you responsible

to get out,

13:09.822 --> 13:11.357

13:11.423 --> 13:14.026
- [gasps]
Mr. Bartleburt!

13:14.093 --> 13:15.461
Happy Arbor Day, sir.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.830
As a tree spirit,
you must be so excited

13:17.897 --> 13:19.365
for this sacred day.

13:19.431 --> 13:20.733
{\an3}- Eh...

13:20.799 --> 13:23.536
- I know what'll get you
into the holiday spirit:

13:23.602 --> 13:26.038
the story of Arbor Day.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.306
It's so magical.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.375
How the heroic
Princess Acornelia

13:29.441 --> 13:31.677
came to the tree spirits'
rescue.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.846
{\an3}I love stories
about strong women.

13:33.913 --> 13:34.980
- Who doesn't?

13:35.047 --> 13:36.215
- All the tree spirits

13:36.282 --> 13:39.385
are trapped in a rock
for 1,000 years?

13:39.451 --> 13:40.719
What?

13:40.786 --> 13:42.855
You know,
this book isn't very accurate,

13:42.922 --> 13:43.923
I got to say.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.524
{\an3}- Huh?
What do you mean?

13:45.591 --> 13:47.493
{\an3}- I mean, this isn't even
anything close

13:47.560 --> 13:49.328
to what the rock
even looked like.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.964
{\an3}I should know.
I was there.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.532
{\an1}- [gasps]
You were?

13:53.599 --> 13:54.767
Mr. Bartleburt,

13:54.833 --> 13:57.469
{\an1}you have to tell me
everything that happened.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.572
Oh, my gosh.
I have the best idea.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.307
What if we made a movie

14:01.373 --> 14:03.375
about the history
of Arbor Day?

14:03.442 --> 14:04.977
We could direct it together.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.879
{\an3}- Um, no.
[laughs]

14:06.946 --> 14:07.880
- Oh, please?

14:07.947 --> 14:08.881
Mr. Bartleburt,

14:08.948 --> 14:10.516
we have to share your story!

14:10.583 --> 14:14.320
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty, pretty, please?

14:14.386 --> 14:16.222
- Aw, how can you say no to her?

14:16.288 --> 14:17.823
She's adorable.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.191
{\an3}- [chiming]

14:19.258 --> 14:21.126
{\an3}- All right.
Stop it.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.861
{\an3}I'll--I'll do it.
I'll tell it.

14:22.928 --> 14:25.231
- Yay!

14:27.633 --> 14:30.236
{\an3}- Yeah, so, um,
here it is.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.104
{\an1}- [gasps]
Oh, my gosh.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.707
This is the rock
where you and your people

14:34.773 --> 14:37.009
were forced to live
all those years.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.045
{\an1}- Oh, no, no, no.
That's it over there.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.348
- The Rock Apartment Complex?

14:42.414 --> 14:44.183
{\an1}- Ha-ha, you didn't think
we were trapped

14:44.250 --> 14:46.418
in an actual rock did you?

14:46.485 --> 14:48.153
{\an1}I mean, how would that
even work?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.456
Because, you know, science.

14:50.522 --> 14:51.724
So how are we doing this?

14:51.790 --> 14:53.325
{\an3}You're gonna act it out,
and I talk?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.160
Or what?
- Yes!

14:55.227 --> 14:56.595
My friends and I
are here to help.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.331
- We're ready
to act our butts off, sir.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.901
{\an1}- Okay, well, you won't really
need all these costumes.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.037
{\an3}- Oh, really?
You didn't wear costumes?

15:05.104 --> 15:06.305
What did you wear?

15:06.372 --> 15:07.406
- Oh, I don't know.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.943
{\an1}Cardigans, turtlenecks,
slacks...

15:11.010 --> 15:13.112
anything beige, really.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.415
There we go.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.218
That's more accurate.

15:19.285 --> 15:20.419
- Okay, everyone.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.488
Our story starts off
with our heroes,

15:22.554 --> 15:26.025
the tree spirits, wandering
in search of a new home.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.660
[bushes rustle]

15:27.726 --> 15:28.827
- Oh, no.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.463
Our homes were ravaged
by Vikings!

15:31.530 --> 15:34.600
We need to find a new one.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.635
{\an1}- I'll scout ahead
and fight off any enemies

15:36.702 --> 15:38.037
with my karate skills.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.306
{\an3}- Here, take this magic crystal
to protect you.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.441
{\an3}I put our hopes and dreams
in it.

15:42.508 --> 15:43.842
{\an1}- Oh, my gosh.
This is beautiful.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.010
What do you think?

15:45.077 --> 15:47.046
{\an3}- Oh, you know,
I have to say

15:47.112 --> 15:48.914
it was a bit far-fetched.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.550
{\an3}We were basically just looking
for a new apartment

15:51.617 --> 15:53.585
{\an3}since my mother-in-law
kicked us out.

15:53.652 --> 15:57.222
{\an3}She wasn't a Viking,
but she sure was beastly.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.624
- Um, o-okay.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.160
{\an1}We'll make those adjustments
and keep going.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.799
{\an3}- Wow, so glad we have
this new apartment.

16:06.865 --> 16:10.302
{\an1}- Finally, a place where we
can watch the golfing channel

16:10.369 --> 16:11.837
and be happy.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.038
- Yeah, right.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.206
Better watch out,

16:14.273 --> 16:15.407
{\an1}'cause this diva queen
is coming,

16:15.474 --> 16:17.076
and you're all ugly.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.211
- But not as ugly as me,

16:19.278 --> 16:21.180
the awful king.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.582
all: We're doomed!

16:23.649 --> 16:24.583
- [groans]

16:24.650 --> 16:25.484
Sorry.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.219
It's incorrect again.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.654
I mean, they weren't royalty.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.689
They were just our landlords.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.726
{\an1}- As if!
That's a load of bull-oney!

16:33.792 --> 16:35.694
- Now, now.
Settle down, Princess.

16:35.761 --> 16:38.464
This is the real, perfect story
of Arbor Day.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.333
Bartleburt knows what happened,
so let's trust him.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.135
[all sigh]

16:43.202 --> 16:44.303
Don't worry, guys.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.072
At least
there's still Acornelia.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.808
{\an3}- Oh, my!
Who will save us?

16:49.875 --> 16:50.876

Fear not,

magic sword of goodness,

16:57.516 --> 16:59.118
have come to liberate you.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.487
{\an1}- Okay, you know,
that was good.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.588
Here's the thing, though.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.323
She wasn't the princess.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.358
She was our on-site manager.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.828
{\an1}Her name wasn't Acornelia.
It was just Cornelia.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.731
{\an1}Everyone just loves acorn puns
around here.

17:12.798 --> 17:16.300
- But, sh-she was magical,
wa-wasn't she?

17:16.367 --> 17:18.036
- No. No magic.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.239
{\an1}Eh, well,
except her ambrosia salad.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.241
Now, that stuff is magical.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.242
- Oh...

17:24.309 --> 17:25.577
If you don't mind,

17:25.644 --> 17:28.513
I think I'll need to go
take a break.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.450

we'll just keep going then.

you're trying to read

18:44.022 --> 18:46.525
I'm out of here.

18:46.592 --> 18:48.360
- Yeah, I don't know.
I got to go.

18:48.427 --> 18:49.862
- You guys want to quit

18:49.928 --> 18:52.865
before the lease termination
scene?

18:52.931 --> 18:54.500
- Sorry, Mr. Bartleburt.

18:54.566 --> 18:56.268
{\an3}I don't think this turned out
as fun

18:56.335 --> 18:57.736
{\an3}as everyone thought
it would be.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.439
- But I tried to make it
as accurate as I could.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.107
- Well, yeah...

19:02.174 --> 19:04.243
{\an3}I actually don't even know
what a lease is,

19:04.309 --> 19:05.844
or a landlord,

19:05.911 --> 19:07.779
{\an3}And I don't give a hoot,
because I'm nine years old.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.982
{\an3}I guess Piri Piri's version
of the story

19:10.048 --> 19:12.417
{\an3}just felt more
like a celebration.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.586
{\an3}Well...

19:14.653 --> 19:18.023
happy Arbor Day,
Mr. Bartleburt.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.026

19:21.093 --> 19:23.762
<i>♪ ♪</i>

19:23.829 --> 19:25.597
- [sighs]

19:25.664 --> 19:29.101
{\an3}- Piri, Piri?
Rise, my child.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.503
Rise from this darkness.

19:31.570 --> 19:32.871
You have a visitor.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.106
- Please, Mother.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.775
{\an1}I don't feel up to seeing anyone
right now.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.943
{\an3}- Oh?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.278
Not even for...

19:39.344 --> 19:41.747
Princess Acornelia?

19:43.649 --> 19:45.617
- Oh, hey.
Hello, there.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.854
- Mr. Bartleburt,
you look very pretty,

19:48.921 --> 19:52.791
but you are not
Princess Acornelia.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.893
- Uh, but of course I am...

19:54.960 --> 19:58.830
with my magic sword,
and the beautiful hair,

19:58.897 --> 20:00.165
and all that.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.568
- Acornelia didn't have
any of those things.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.704
She was just your kindly,
on-site manager.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.973
None of it's real.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.308
- You know, Piri,

20:09.374 --> 20:12.444
{\an3}even if your version
of Arbor Day isn't, um,

20:12.511 --> 20:14.580
necessarily accurate,

20:14.646 --> 20:16.949
{\an3}that doesn't mean
it's not meaningful.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.451
{\an3}The way I celebrate
Arbor Day

20:19.518 --> 20:21.520
is to remember
all the facts,

20:21.587 --> 20:23.455
but the way you celebrate,

20:23.522 --> 20:26.158
with all your songs and dances--

20:26.224 --> 20:28.560
well, it makes everybody happy,

20:28.627 --> 20:31.730
{\an3}and I'd say,
that's pretty magical.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.298
{\an3}Piri?

20:33.365 --> 20:35.100
Piri, could you say something?

20:35.167 --> 20:37.803
{\an3}I'm starting to feel
a little uncomfortable.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.504
{\an1}- [crying]

20:39.571 --> 20:40.806
Do you really mean it?

20:40.872 --> 20:43.775
{\an1}Do you really think
I make Arbor Day magical?

20:43.842 --> 20:46.678
{\an3}- [sighs]
Yeah, I really do.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.714
Oh, I almost forgot...

20:56.254 --> 20:58.457
[tears bubbling]

20:58.523 --> 21:00.025
- Thank you, Mr. Bartleburt.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.693
{\an3}- That's all right.
You're welcome.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.929
{\an3}What do you say,
let's make that movie--

21:03.996 --> 21:05.931
the real version of Arbor Day

21:05.998 --> 21:09.701
with a little touch
of Piri Piri magic?

21:09.768 --> 21:11.503
- I'd like that very much,

21:11.570 --> 21:14.640
but you have to be
Princess Acornelia,

21:14.706 --> 21:17.576
{\an1}because you look amazing
in that costume.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.479
- I do look pretty good,
huh?

21:21.613 --> 21:23.882
{\an1}- There's no escape
for you losers.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.419
{\an1}- You're legally bound
by this contract.

21:27.486 --> 21:30.155
[evil laughter]

21:30.222 --> 21:31.523
- Oh, no!

21:31.590 --> 21:33.959
What are we,
the tree spirits, going to do?

21:34.026 --> 21:37.596
- Hark!
I hear salvation approaching.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.799
- Yes, it is I,
Magic Princess Acornelia,

21:40.866 --> 21:45.237
who is also your brave and kind
on-site manager.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.275
- Oh, thank you,
beautiful Acornelia!

21:50.342 --> 21:53.912
Now all of the tree spirits
can go and live in peace.

21:53.979 --> 21:54.813
- Yup.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.748
Happy Arbor Day, everyone.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.184
all: Happy Arbor Day!
