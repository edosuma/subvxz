00:09.134 --> 00:11.219
<i>My mother left when I was three.</i>

00:16.766 --> 00:18.309
Hey, John B. Hey, buddy.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.228
<i>For the whole time growing up...</i>

00:20.228 --> 00:21.146
Uh-oh.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.856
<i>...it was just me and my pops.</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:33.033
<i>In some ways,
he was the best father you could imagine.</i>

00:33.992 --> 00:36.828
- ...never again.

00:36.828 --> 00:40.665
<i>Taught me how to work
and what to do after work.</i>

00:41.833 --> 00:44.294
If I get a B, will you let me smoke pot?

00:44.294 --> 00:46.671
<i>More of a friend than a father.</i>

00:47.255 --> 00:51.009
The name of the game is
to beat John B. You going all in?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.179
<i>He wasn't overprotective at all.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:55.680
Guess who's paying rent this month.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.599
<i>Like any family, we had our moments.</i>

00:57.599 --> 00:59.184
- No.
-  You're not being reasonable.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.436
-  We're not selling the Twinkie.
- Yes, we are.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.189
- No. You are the worst dad ever!
- We'll just sell it now.

01:04.189 --> 01:07.442
I'll buy you a brand-new van
the second I get the Merchant gold.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.236
-  Stop. Don't you...
- Don't get in that van, boy!

01:10.236 --> 01:12.572
- You get in that van, you don't come back!
- Stop it!

01:12.572 --> 01:13.740
- You hear me?
- Move!

01:14.699 --> 01:16.910
You hear me, John B? Don't you come back!

01:18.620 --> 01:20.789
<i>That was the last time I saw him.</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:29.380
<i>It's one thing to lose a father.</i>

01:30.715 --> 01:33.426
<i>It's another thing
to never get to say goodbye.</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:52.320
Please let it be him.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.959
I love you, Bird,
even if I didn't always act like it.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.670
Bring it on in, John B!

03:33.421 --> 03:34.756
Bring it on home, boy!

03:35.256 --> 03:37.050
I'll see you on the other side.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.804
Goodbye, Dad.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.979
Dad?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.615
Is that really you?

04:04.118 --> 04:07.205
What took you so long, Bird?
I've been ringing for hours.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.301
I thought
you were dead.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.636
I thought you were dead.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.640
I'm sorry for the Houdini act.
It's a long story, kid.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.602
Check the church!

04:30.186 --> 04:31.521
For another time.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.606
What?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.441
- We gotta vanish.
- Pops, talk to me.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.736
Come on. Keep your head down. Head down.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.366
Shit, ain't going that way.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.452
Um, the Pogues, the marina,
they've got a boat. Come on. Follow me.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.579
Good boy.
It's good to see you, kid.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.915
Yeah, you too, Pop. Come on, hurry up.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.761
I think we're good. That was a close one.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.138
Okay, Dad. Start talking.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.724
So you've been alive this whole time
and didn't think to call?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.100
What, you think I didn't want to?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.977
It killed me.
It would've put you in danger.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.104
I was in danger
the entire time you were gone.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.857
Hey, look, we're here now. Okay?

05:16.649 --> 05:20.653
And I'm not going anywhere.
I just had to vanish for my safety.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.990
And for yours.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.117
Look, it wasn't my first choice.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.037
You got to know that.
Let's go find your friends.

05:30.913 --> 05:31.956
Come on, buddy.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.840
So this is what we're doing, huh?
We're just sailing out.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.717
We're just gonna forget about John B?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.471
We should never have left him.
We're turning back.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.474
No! We're all gonna get caught.
What type of plan is that?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.684
It's a plan to stick together, Cleo.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.311
Then we are dead together.

05:54.687 --> 05:58.858
She's right. We had to leave, or we'd
all be zip-tied in the back of a pickup.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.569
We did the right thing.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.908
Come on, Dad.
The boat's docked right over here.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.077
- Shit.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.621
They're gone.
Singh must've run them off.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.165
Okay, plan B. We take my boat.
It's back at my place.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.418
- We gotta pick something up there anyway.
- Hang on, I gotta call them.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.095
- Who's that?
- It's Portis.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.098
Portis? That's John B.
That's definitely John B. Hold on.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.184
- Yo! Dude! Is this you?
-  <i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.812
- Speaker. Speaker.
- What-- Do you need us to turn around?

06:35.812 --> 06:38.606
- No, don't worry about it.
- Yo, say it again. Say it again.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.400
<i>I said
don't worry about me, okay?</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:42.819
Look, it's way too hot here.
You gotta get out of here.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.903
Go back to OBX.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.531
- We do not copy. Can you--
- Let me talk to him.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.241
- John B?
-  <i>Sarah...</i>

06:48.241 --> 06:51.035
-  <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Yes. I'm fine. Everything's good. Listen.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.162
He's fine. Thank God. What happened?

06:53.162 --> 06:54.997
<i>I found my dad.</i>

06:55.790 --> 06:57.708
- He's alive.
-  <i>Wait. What'd you say?</i>

06:57.708 --> 06:59.794
<i>-</i> <i>John B?</i>
- Sarah.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.547
<i>- Sarah?</i>
- I... I can't hear you.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.215
- Hello?
-  <i>John B?</i>

07:04.715 --> 07:07.552
<i>Get out of there.
I'll meet you on Kildare, okay?</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:08.886
Kildare, when?

07:08.886 --> 07:10.221
- Hello?
-  <i>Kildare--</i>

07:10.221 --> 07:11.806
- Goddamn it.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.142
John B! No, no, no. John B!

07:15.643 --> 07:17.520
- Hope they heard that.
- Me too.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.147
We better go.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.733
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Come on, boy. To the right. Go, go.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.654
- Kildare. What the hell?
- You guys think he found his father?

07:26.654 --> 07:30.074
- He's been missing for almost a year.
- Sarah, what do you think?

07:30.074 --> 07:32.160
- Should we go back?
- Sarah-- We're sitting ducks.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.411
We need to make a decision.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.955
Are we turning back around,
or are we gonna keep going?

07:37.206 --> 07:38.624
Sarah, come on!

07:38.624 --> 07:40.960
- Sarah, we need to make a decision!
- He said go.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.921
- Hold on, listen.
- Go.

07:43.921 --> 07:44.922
- Sarah.
- Go!

07:57.143 --> 07:58.769
This is it right here. Come on.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.688
Here.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.648
Follow me.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.615
Here it is. The spider hole.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.659
It ain't much,
but it ain't a bad place to lay low.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.953
Okay, spider hole, good name.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.294
Still hunting, huh, Pop?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.630
I'm breathing, I'm hunting, man,
what can I say?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.591
This time I'm putting
it all together, John B.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.677
Getting close, I can feel it.
Onto something big.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.225
I, uh... I heard you died
at the Shoals, Dad?

08:38.351 --> 08:42.480
Yeah, well, somebody died out there.
It wasn't me.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.984
Look. Just gotta go
on a little retrieval mission.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.570
- Then we can split.
- Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad, Dad, wait.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.282
Retrieval mission? A gun? What--
No! What are we doing?

08:54.325 --> 08:56.994
The game is afoot. Okay, kid? Right now.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.999
And this time it's for the mother lode,
the big kahuna, all the marbles.

09:01.999 --> 09:02.917
- All right?
- Right.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.420
Okay. Come here.
It is good to see you. It is.

09:07.004 --> 09:12.218
But if we don't move out, like, now,
the game is gonna end early. All right?

09:12.218 --> 09:14.637
It ain't just Singh that's after us.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.848
I got mixed up with Limbrey
and a whole lot of things.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.059
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.604
- Did you just say Limbrey?

09:23.604 --> 09:27.733
- Like Carla Limbrey?
- Yeah. How do you think we got a boat?

09:27.733 --> 09:28.859
Come on, man.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.152
- No, no, no.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.446
She... she helped me out a little bit.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.365
It's logistics, etcetera,

09:34.365 --> 09:36.534
but now that I found you,
I'm gonna owe her something.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.828
Better to pay later than now.

09:40.371 --> 09:44.458
I can explain it all. Focus. We gotta go.

09:45.626 --> 09:46.711
We gotta go!

09:46.711 --> 09:48.212
Shit all over the place.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.298
That a boy! This way!

10:08.399 --> 10:10.443
Well-done, boy!

10:26.125 --> 10:27.126
Oh, honey.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.380
Hi.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.174
Are you okay?

10:33.174 --> 10:34.717
Of course, I'm okay.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.846
Come here.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.310
Where are we?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.686
We're in Guadeloupe.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.522
We're safe.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.032
Where's Rafe?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.500
<i>♪ Two pound a weed in the van back ♪</i>

11:07.500 --> 11:10.002
<i>♪ It in your handbag, your knapsack ♪</i>

11:10.002 --> 11:13.422
<i>♪ It in your backpack
The smell give your girlfriend contact ♪</i>

11:13.422 --> 11:15.591
<i>♪ Some boy don't know this... ♪</i>

11:15.591 --> 11:16.926
Do you like this one?

11:23.015 --> 11:23.933
- Hey, man.
- Huh?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.393
Sorry. Sorry to bother you.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.727
- Um...
- What's up?

11:26.727 --> 11:30.147
I have the perfect...
I have the perfect gift for your wife.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.108
- It's like a great price too.
-  Yeah?

11:32.108 --> 11:34.527
So this, all through here,
is where all the tourists shop,

11:34.527 --> 11:37.154
but the real deal is right back here.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.906
It's a great local spot.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.409
- I don't know.
- Just trying to help you out.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.077
- Just real quick. You wanna?
- Okay.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.413
Yeah, yeah.
It's got, like, some of the best,

11:45.413 --> 11:47.248
like, custom jewelry on the island.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.125
- It's incredible.
- Sounds good.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.835
Uh, just right back here.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.753
-  Through here?
- Yeah.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.197
All right. Come on, folks,
all aboard to Guadeloupe.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.866
- How you doing, boss?
- Good. How are you?

12:21.866 --> 12:22.908
Living the dream.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.035
You got some sun
since you took this photo, man.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.787
- There you go, Mr. Tompkins.
- Appreciate it.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.373
- Enjoy Guadeloupe.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.632
So you sure you didn't tell him
where the diary is?

12:39.216 --> 12:41.969
I told him I'd seen it,
but I didn't tell him where.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.013
Why does Singh want it so much?

12:44.013 --> 12:47.516
Singh said that he thinks
the diary has a clue

12:48.184 --> 12:50.394
to the location of some city of gold.

12:50.978 --> 12:54.356
Like the gold on the Merchant
was just a small part of it.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.359
Okay, so the diary we have
leads to a 500-year-old treasure

12:57.359 --> 12:58.944
that no one's ever found?

12:58.944 --> 13:00.070
Pretty much.

13:01.655 --> 13:05.409
I'm in. It's kind of like my best option
at this point, so...

13:05.409 --> 13:09.413
- Definitely beats geometry class.
- Yeah, beats boarding school.

13:09.413 --> 13:12.875
I mean, I don't even know what'll happen
when we get back to the OBX.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.544
Nothing good. I can tell you that.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.797
Nothing good.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.132
Shit is going to suck for like a year.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.927
At least you don't got
a restitution, though. No job.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.472
No parents. Yeah, arrows
are going to be coming in hot.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.141
But you know what we do
when arrows come flying?

13:29.850 --> 13:32.728
Bing. Ding, ding, ding! Ding!

13:32.728 --> 13:35.105
- Uh, quick!
- And you shoot right back at them.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.275
And that spear comes at you,
you plant, grab,

13:38.275 --> 13:41.529
disarm, straight into the jugular,
finish them off like...

13:46.033 --> 13:47.034
Just one by one.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.662
We'll defeat them all.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.291
You know, whatever happens,

13:55.167 --> 13:57.002
we're gonna handle it together.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.879
Like we always do.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.590
Kie.

14:03.008 --> 14:03.926
Hey.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.934
Just wanted to let you guys know
that we should probably stop for gas.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.314
Pope, I, uh... Yeah. Uh...

14:17.314 --> 14:19.900
- Yeah.
-  Pope. Hey, Pope.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.324
Shit.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.288
I'll talk to him.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.510
So what's the plan, Pop?

14:46.510 --> 14:48.220
Just like I said, Bird,

14:48.220 --> 14:51.640
just a little pit stop to get that thing
I was telling you about.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.267
Then goodbye, Bridgetown.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.477
Come on, partner. Back me up.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.396
All right. Let's make this quick.

14:57.897 --> 15:02.109
What do we have here?
God of Fire and War?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.694
Significant piece.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.702
Sorry. I have an appointment.
Maybe another time.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.163
- Dad, what are we doing?
- Just got to pick something up.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.372
Only take a minute.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.166
RJ.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.083
John.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.212
- Please come.
-  Long time.

15:23.797 --> 15:24.757
Okay.

15:27.968 --> 15:31.347
So, what are you doing here, John?
What do you want?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.435
Sorry for the strong arm, RJ,
but we're pressed for time.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.896
I can't get bogged down
in a protracted negotiation.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.482
Really? You pull a gun on me?

15:41.482 --> 15:44.276
Your partner, who saved your life?

15:44.276 --> 15:47.196
If you knew what happened,
you wouldn't hold it against me.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.699
And I knew you'd buck at the finish line.
Just give me the piece.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.576
- Armed robbery?
-  It's not robbery.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.536
The piece is mine. Ain't that right, RJ?

15:56.038 --> 16:00.250
I think an impartial judge
would say the ownership is debatable.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.377
- Oh great.
-  Mmm.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.880
As you can see,
I kept my part of the bargain, partner.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.133
Here it is safe and sound.
Just like I promised.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.177
I've missed seeing you.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.145
Here, kid. Take a look at this.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.109
The Signpost of Orinoco.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.195
Signpost of what?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.198
This way lies the treasure,
that sort of thing.

16:31.198 --> 16:35.411
At least we think that's what it says.
Next stop, El Dorado.

16:35.411 --> 16:40.332
Yeah, if you can find the other half...
and if you can decipher it, maybe.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.292
And I'm going to want my cut.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.753
Don't think I won't come after you
if I don't get it.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.921
If this thing works out,

16:45.921 --> 16:48.841
you'll never have to sell
a knockoff God of Fire and War again.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.635
Arjun! You here?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.012
Wait.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.513
Don't move.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.103
Mr. Singh!

17:01.103 --> 17:04.148
- Shit.
-  What a surprise!

17:05.441 --> 17:06.608
How can I help you?

17:06.608 --> 17:09.028
It's always a pleasure
to come into your shop, Arjun.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.363
You have such fine pieces, you know?

17:11.947 --> 17:15.034
I would love to show you around,
but unfortunately, we're closed.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.328
Oh, come on now, Arjun.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.541
Just a quick look around
for your best customer, now.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.046
- Of course.

17:28.964 --> 17:33.218
- You need to talk to me right now.
- John B, we gotta get out of here now.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.720
- Here, here, take this.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.181
Take this over to that window. Go, go!

17:38.807 --> 17:42.811
We have some fine new pieces.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.314
- I see that.
-  Mm-hmm.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.398
Mm-hmm.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.030
-  Easy, easy, easy.
-  I'm trying, I'm trying!

17:57.826 --> 17:58.827
Shit! It's stuck!

18:01.121 --> 18:03.665
I've always said
you have a good eye, Arjun.

18:03.665 --> 18:06.168
And I know
when someone else has a good eye

18:06.752 --> 18:08.504
because I have a good eye too.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.091
- It takes one to know one, you know.
- Mm.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.344
Shh!

18:17.846 --> 18:19.723
I know
the young man John B Routledge

18:19.723 --> 18:21.308
was seen with an older man

18:22.059 --> 18:23.393
close to here,

18:23.393 --> 18:26.105
and I thought to myself,
you know, I thought,

18:27.523 --> 18:30.943
"Why would those two risk
coming so close to downtown?"

18:32.361 --> 18:34.530
A place with so many eyes.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.449
- All right, coast is clear.
- All right, we gotta go.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.123
And then I realize, you know, I realize

18:44.665 --> 18:47.209
that they were very close to your shop,

18:47.209 --> 18:50.420
and I thought to myself,
I thought, you know...

18:52.131 --> 18:55.134
..."They have to come
and see my old friend Arjun,

18:55.134 --> 18:58.262
who has such a good eye
for fine pieces," huh?

18:58.262 --> 19:00.556
- I've not seen them. I don't know.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.850
You know, I can always tell

19:03.392 --> 19:05.352
when people are lying to me, you know?

19:05.853 --> 19:07.771
Shh. Come on.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.357
- I gotcha! I gotcha! I gotcha!

19:11.108 --> 19:14.778
Help me out.
Help out your old man. Help me. Come on.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.280
Shh! Shh! Dad! Hey!

19:17.072 --> 19:18.949
- Where's the piece?
- I thought you had it.

19:18.949 --> 19:19.908
No!

19:19.908 --> 19:22.578
- No, no, no. Just... Damn it. Hurry up.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.542
- You seen them? Are you hiding them?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.754
- Arjun? Huh?

19:37.926 --> 19:39.720
- Stand up. Stand up.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.224
I swear,
I don't know where they are.

19:48.979 --> 19:49.938
Go now.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.608
- Hey.
- I...

20:02.034 --> 20:03.493
They went through the alley.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.954
- Come on. We gotta go.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.373
-  Oh shit!
-  Oh shit!

20:08.957 --> 20:10.125
Gotta run! Let's go!

20:10.125 --> 20:12.127
Go! Go! Come on!

20:19.051 --> 20:20.344
They went there!

20:24.640 --> 20:25.807
Run, run! Go!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.352
Get on the boat!

20:30.103 --> 20:31.813
Yeah, yeah! Get us off, get us off!

20:43.033 --> 20:45.452
You got it, John B!

20:46.078 --> 20:47.246
Let's <i>vámonos</i>!

20:47.871 --> 20:48.789
Get the boats.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.165
Let them go.

20:50.165 --> 20:53.627
- We could be in a boat in 30 minutes.
- And chase them into the night?

20:53.627 --> 20:55.879
In the dark and open water, hmm?

20:55.879 --> 20:59.591
And risk going into Saint Lucia
or Martinique? We can't do that.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.801
No, why bother?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.887
You know, 'cause I know where they live.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.431
And I have friends everywhere, you know?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.953
Almost to port, bro. Want to fill her up?

21:30.455 --> 21:31.873
Need to get some food too.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.423
Hey Pope. Pope, look, man.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.219
Look, I know you think
you saw something up here.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.762
Or maybe you did see something.

21:46.346 --> 21:50.392
I don't know, but straight up,
nothing actually happened.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.519
You ain't gotta lie to me.

21:52.519 --> 21:56.606
I'm not lying to you, Pope. Okay.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.401
We're Pogues. We do not lie to each other.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.610
It doesn't matter.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.904
Pope, I don't want things
to be weird between us, okay?

22:02.904 --> 22:04.156
Well, things aren't weird.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.116
- They aren't weird now?
- No, things aren't weird.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.160
Well, then who's lying right now?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.874
- If you're asking me if I like it?
- Yeah.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.210
No, it's not my favorite thing ever,

22:17.210 --> 22:20.213
but I'm not gonna stop you.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.924
- It's your choice.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.636
You do what you want.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.341
Yeah, see,
that'll put hair on your chest there.

23:04.341 --> 23:09.554
So, what's the deal
with this whole big kahuna thing?

23:09.554 --> 23:12.849
- Mmm.
- I mean, how did you end up on Barbados?

23:12.849 --> 23:16.269
Well, same way you did
and for the same reason too.

23:16.978 --> 23:18.021
The treasure.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.233
And Carlos Singh.

23:23.318 --> 23:28.115
Yeah, I was marooned out on the Shoals
for what felt like months,

23:28.115 --> 23:32.327
living on seaweed and sweat and rainwater,

23:32.327 --> 23:35.038
and fixed myself up to be crab food.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.873
Thought I was a goner.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.295
<i>Singh must have tracked my boat,
then his men showed up.</i>

23:42.295 --> 23:45.799
<i>He must have known I was onto something

23:47.175 --> 23:49.136
<i>At first, I thought I was being rescued.</i>

23:49.845 --> 23:54.933
Turns out it was less of a rescue mission,
more of a captivity-type deal. Yeah.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.645
-  Hey! Hey, hands up.

23:58.645 --> 23:59.855
Drop the damn rock!

24:00.522 --> 24:02.899
<i>-</i> <i>I didn't go without a fight.</i>

24:02.899 --> 24:05.735
<i>We left one of his men behind,
as I'm sure you've heard.</i>

24:07.237 --> 24:09.614
Next thing I know,
I'm being shipped off to Barbados.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.825
<i>Singh's place.</i>

24:11.825 --> 24:14.327
- Hey!

24:14.327 --> 24:18.165
<i>They locked me up
in some audacious estate surrounded</i>

24:18.165 --> 24:21.084
by cane fields and armed guards.

24:21.084 --> 24:24.588
I meet this particular little man, Singh.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.715
<i>He wants to cut a deal with me.</i>

24:26.715 --> 24:29.259
<i>He wants me to tell him everything I know</i>

24:29.801 --> 24:32.387
<i>in exchange for him keeping me alive.</i>

24:33.054 --> 24:36.057
But it didn't take long
before I caught on to the game.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.146
<i>So as soon as I got a chance,
I took it.</i>

24:41.146 --> 24:44.524
<i>Got a little roughed up along the way,
but I made it out.</i>

24:46.401 --> 24:48.111
<i>And not empty-handed.</i>

24:55.577 --> 24:56.745

Gotta be one nearby.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.804
All right.
Time to gain some provisions, yeah?

25:14.804 --> 25:17.098
So you're just gonna walk in there
and shoplift?

25:17.098 --> 25:18.975
You got a pocketful of cash?

25:23.146 --> 25:25.732
So what? No snappy comeback?

25:26.316 --> 25:27.692
Come on.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.319
Come on, Gray Pipe.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.364

Okay? Go do your thing.

Okay.

Hey!

26:23.081 --> 26:25.500
- Watch your step, friend.
- It wasn't me, mate.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.337
- You is the only person here.
- A woman came through and knocked it over.

26:29.337 --> 26:33.842
You're rushing in, and you're telling me
it's all my fault, blah, blah, blah.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.928

my palate with a bit of that rum.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.556

-  What bag?

26:46.646 --> 26:48.732
- This thing? Back there.
-  What do--

26:48.732 --> 26:51.026
Yo, man, you trying
to sell my man bad mangoes?

26:51.026 --> 26:54.112
- This mango was just picked, man.
- You know that got the blight on it.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.282
I've been picking mangoes since I was
a youth, and you know that'll kill my man.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.825
You eat this mango, it eat you.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.828
You end up like a sick hamster
on your back, dirt on your shirt.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.289
Fresh-- Hey!

27:04.289 --> 27:06.625
Can't believe you think
I sound like that!

27:06.625 --> 27:07.584
You!

27:07.584 --> 27:10.295
Come back here! Hey, hey!
Where do you think you're going?

27:10.295 --> 27:12.672
Hey, you! Come back here!
Little thieving rat!

27:12.672 --> 27:16.676
You know, I don't know what's worse.
The sick hamster or that accent.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.595
You cannot be serious.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.097
Yeah, you! Thieving rat!

27:24.559 --> 27:26.895
Enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.397
Who are you sweet on these days, huh?

27:30.398 --> 27:32.317
I know there must be someone.

27:32.317 --> 27:36.029
Yeah. Yeah. There's, uh... there's been
some developments on that front.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.327
I'm married, Dad.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.247
You're joking, right?

27:46.247 --> 27:47.332
No.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.629
- What, is she pregnant?
- No, no. God, no. No.

27:52.629 --> 27:56.549
Yeah, I haven't really had time
for the extracurricular activities.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.551
You're a little young, ain't ya?

27:58.551 --> 28:01.262
I mean, you said it best.
If it's right, it's right.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.307

28:05.308 --> 28:08.311
Yeah.
Yeah, you know her. Um...

28:14.526 --> 28:15.527
It's Sarah

28:16.528 --> 28:18.029
Cameron.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.870
Ward's daughter?

28:26.454 --> 28:28.123
The queen of Kildare.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.166
Yeah.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.129
You just can't do things the easy way,
can you?

28:40.593 --> 28:41.761
Are you mad?

28:45.306 --> 28:47.058
That you went for the big prize?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.060
Nah.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.439
How could I be mad about that?

29:01.656 --> 29:02.782
Congratulations.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.332
Okay.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.505
Jackpot.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.509
Why your wybe so sorry, bey?

29:24.012 --> 29:26.723
Is it what happened
between you and JJ earlier, right?

29:27.307 --> 29:28.266
No.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.604
Come on. No need to tell a fib.
We all see what's happening here.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.609
When we were coming into port,

29:38.610 --> 29:41.863
I went up to let JJ and Kiara know
we were pulling in,

29:42.697 --> 29:45.533
and I saw them

29:46.201 --> 29:47.452
about to...

29:51.664 --> 29:54.209
And you two were together before, right?

29:55.502 --> 29:56.753
For like a night.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.756
Then Kiara gave you the boot.

30:01.132 --> 30:02.091
Sorry.

30:02.884 --> 30:06.888
Just how I heard it. So what?
Same thing happened to me.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.474
There was this bad man back on my island.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.435
Taught me how to survive on a street.

30:12.435 --> 30:15.522
Best thief I ever seen.
I mean, a true master.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.565
I fell for him.

30:18.441 --> 30:22.612
Turns out he was stealing from me too,
and I felt like an idiot.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.533
Love. Better to let it go.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.576
Shut that shit down, Pipe.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.828
Cold turkey.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.622
That works for you?

30:34.123 --> 30:36.668
I mean, do you see me
with my face all long,

30:36.668 --> 30:39.420
thinking about someone
who's not thinking about me?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.509
You and me have the same problem.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.053
Tried love once, and it didn't work out.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.264
We should start a club.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.308
Call it the No Love Club.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.060
-  What?
- The No Love Club.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.646
- That's so corny.
- Oh, come on, think about it.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.568
Cold turkey
from all obsessive thoughts, huh?

31:02.235 --> 31:04.946
It's gonna be hard.
I have a lot of obsessive thoughts.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.116
Well, feelings pass like the tide.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.161
I'm down.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.081
I'm down. Let's do it. No Love Club.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.875
All right!

31:17.834 --> 31:21.087
Well, I guess we got to come
up with a handshake, right?

31:21.087 --> 31:22.964
- A handshake?
-  I'll show you.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.425
Uh, uh.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.260
- Love.
- Yeah.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.429
- No chance.
- No chance.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.847
Then you gotta rock away with it.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.432
- Rock away.
- I'll teach you some rhythm.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.517
- Okay, I like it.
- There you go. There you go.

31:34.517 --> 31:37.186
You got some rhythm.
There's hope for you after all.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.146
- I like it.

31:38.146 --> 31:42.525

31:42.525 --> 31:47.238

32:17.060 --> 32:18.436
Hey, Birdy Boy.

32:18.436 --> 32:22.023
See, most people think
the Golden City is here

32:23.107 --> 32:25.151
up above the Orinoco Basin.

32:25.151 --> 32:28.154
That Spanish ship,
the one with the cross and the gold.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.280
Yeah. The San Jose.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.534
They were rumored to have found El Dorado.
That's where all the gold came from.

32:34.118 --> 32:37.705
And this stone piece is supposedly

32:37.705 --> 32:39.749
what led them to El Dorado.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.253
Now the captain of the San Jose

32:44.253 --> 32:46.339
wanted to be the only one
who knew how to get there,

32:46.339 --> 32:50.093
so he dug this up out of the jungle,
kept it with him.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.511
At least that's the story.

32:51.511 --> 32:55.807
So the idea is,
if you can translate this stone piece,

32:57.183 --> 33:00.228
then boom, it tells you how to get there.

33:00.228 --> 33:03.898
- Um, that little stone piece is broken.

33:03.898 --> 33:07.360
Singh thinks that the diary holds a clue
to the missing piece.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.987
I think he's probably right.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.864
- Yep.
- Only one way to find out.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.034
This is the big one, kid.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.830
I've been obsessed with this
since I was your age,

33:18.830 --> 33:21.040
going out into the blank spaces,

33:22.208 --> 33:23.459
hunting for treasure,

33:24.293 --> 33:25.336
and finding it.

33:27.130 --> 33:32.427
But as I got older, I began to think
that all those spaces had been filled in,

33:32.427 --> 33:34.887
that there was nothing left to discover.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.974
Till I got on this.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.936
I've been dreaming
about this my whole life.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.315
We find that diary, boy,

33:46.941 --> 33:48.735
we decipher those scribblings...

33:50.820 --> 33:52.655
we're on our way to El Dorado.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.160
- Oh.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.871
Whoa. Look at that.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.457
Whoa!

34:02.457 --> 34:04.959
Look at that beauty!
Thar she blows!

34:06.419 --> 34:07.503
Holy shit.

34:08.087 --> 34:10.214
- That's amazing.

34:10.214 --> 34:14.093
Sure is! It's a sign, Bird.

34:15.053 --> 34:15.970
Wow.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.098
We're gonna find it... together.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.601
Together.

34:31.861 --> 34:35.239
Listen, I understand the risks
involved with selling the cross, okay?

34:35.239 --> 34:37.366
I saw an opportunity,
and I took it. That's it.

34:37.366 --> 34:40.828
You know,
and I thought that you would wake up,

34:40.828 --> 34:43.456
and I would tell you
that it was taken care of.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.209
And I don't know,
maybe you'd be proud of me or something,

34:46.209 --> 34:47.835
because I'm the one who brought it home.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.253
- I did it.
- Jesus, Rafe.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.672
- Now I feel like an idiot.
-  Rafe, stop it!

34:51.672 --> 34:53.508
- No, I am.
- You're not an idiot. Are you--

34:53.508 --> 34:56.010
- I feel like an idiot, and--
- I went down, and you stepped up.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.304
I'm just glad you're okay, you understand?

34:58.304 --> 34:59.722
- Hey!
-  Yeah.

34:59.722 --> 35:03.518
It's your first big deal, all right?
I remember mine. It didn't go well either.

35:04.477 --> 35:08.314
I could have told you, it's Barbados.
Carlos Singh does what he wants there.

35:09.732 --> 35:12.068
- It's okay.
-  Yeah.

35:20.201 --> 35:23.287
There's something I need you
to do for me right now, okay?

35:25.456 --> 35:26.415
Name it.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.794
I need you to go back to the Outer Banks.

35:30.837 --> 35:31.796
Kildare.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.422
Why?

35:33.422 --> 35:36.342
There's nothing there for us, not anymore.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.805
I need you to wrap everything up
for me, all right?

35:40.805 --> 35:43.808
I need you to sell the businesses,
sell the rental properties.

35:46.602 --> 35:48.062
I need you to sell Tannyhill.

35:50.231 --> 35:53.693
Wait, we're selling Tannyhill?
Is that what you said?

35:55.820 --> 35:56.821
Yeah.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.907
Why?
What are you talking about?

36:01.701 --> 36:03.244
It's not our home anymore.

36:04.745 --> 36:05.788
This is.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.665
This is our home now.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.711
And it's a clean slate.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.921
It's a new beginning, a new path.

36:13.921 --> 36:16.632
And I need you
to take a bigger role, all right?

36:17.633 --> 36:19.177
Can I count on you for that?

36:21.220 --> 36:23.890
- Yeah?
- Of course, yes. Of course, Dad.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.641
Yeah, all right, good.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.519
Listen, I got some papers inside.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.980
I'm gonna bring them.
We're gonna go over them.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.982
Tell you what to do,
and while you're gone,

36:32.982 --> 36:36.068
I am going to be taking that cross
and looking into it.

36:36.569 --> 36:40.448
We have that cross because of you.
You got it for us, and you saved it.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.742
I just need you to be careful.

36:42.742 --> 36:47.747
You get in there, handle this business,
and you get back here safely. All right?

36:48.748 --> 36:50.249
- You're a Cameron.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.961
That still means something.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.231
I gotta admit.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.483
It's good to be back.

37:27.828 --> 37:31.207
Would you look at this place!

37:31.207 --> 37:35.628
Oh, wow! You know, I never thought
I'd miss this place so much!

37:57.817 --> 37:59.235
Bring it on in, son.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.030
Bring it on home.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.868
I sure have missed this place.

38:08.828 --> 38:09.745
Yeah, me too.

38:12.873 --> 38:13.874
Huh.

38:17.503 --> 38:18.462
Check it out.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.048
Got my own headstone.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.594
Would you ever give me one of those?

38:27.596 --> 38:28.556
Never.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.603
Welcome home, Pop.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.357
- Thanks, kid.
- Come on.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.402
Stand out here and get bit
by mosquitoes this whole damn time,

38:41.402 --> 38:42.403
or you wanna go inside?

38:42.403 --> 38:44.488
I missed the mosquitoes,
believe it or not.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.204
I don't know why in the hell
you wouldn't wanna sleep

38:52.204 --> 38:56.125
on the porch couch
when it's so much cooler in here.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.421
Yeah. It's hot tonight.

39:00.421 --> 39:04.425
Yeah, especially with no electricity.
You didn't think to pay the bill?

39:04.425 --> 39:07.011
You know, I was stranded
on a deserted island

39:07.011 --> 39:08.637
a little longer than I thought.

39:08.637 --> 39:10.848
Yeah, I guess that is an excuse.

39:17.104 --> 39:20.858
Hey, John B, you... you know
where that... that diary is, right?

39:21.400 --> 39:23.319
Well, we have a copy.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.489
And it's in the Twinkie,

39:26.489 --> 39:29.950
which is probably
in the impound lot with the police.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.828
Gotta figure that one out.

39:33.871 --> 39:34.830
Yeah.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.630
Hey, Pop?

39:42.630 --> 39:43.631
Yeah, kid?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.176
Remember the last time we were together?

39:48.260 --> 39:50.096
- We had that argument?
- Yeah.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.769
Yeah, real knock-down-drag-out.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.188
Yeah.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.484
I shouldn't have said that.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.615
You're not the worst father ever.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.909
No shit, Sherlock.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.125
Love you, Pop.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.211
I love you, Bird.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.635
Enough of this sappy shit.
Let's go to bed.

40:31.011 --> 40:32.096
Sleep soundly.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.653
Dad?

41:01.167 --> 41:02.126
Dad?

41:32.740 --> 41:33.824
Calm down, now!

41:33.824 --> 41:37.495
- Calm down, we can talk about this!
-  Tell me where El Dorado is, John!

41:37.495 --> 41:38.996
I know you know!

41:38.996 --> 41:40.623
- Hey!
-  John B!

41:44.710 --> 41:48.088
This is not the end, John!
I'll see you in hell!

41:55.304 --> 41:57.890
This is your fault. You did this.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.854
Hey.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.106
Hi.

42:08.943 --> 42:09.902
Sarah?

42:11.570 --> 42:13.781
- Hi.
- It's you. You're here.

42:13.781 --> 42:14.865
Yeah.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.284
Oh my God. Oh my God.

42:17.284 --> 42:18.994
Hi. Hi.

42:20.496 --> 42:21.872
It's okay. Hi. Hi.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.791
You're home. You're safe.

42:24.792 --> 42:26.085
We made it back.

42:26.085 --> 42:29.046
- I missed you. Oh my God.
- I'm here. I know.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.173
I'm so sorry we left.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.425
- I am so sorry.

42:35.094 --> 42:38.055
They just dropped me off.
I didn't even know if you'd be here.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.725
We literally couldn't hear
anything on the phone.

42:42.601 --> 42:44.562
What? You couldn't hear anything?

42:45.062 --> 42:47.898
No, just that we should come back
to OBX, but that's it.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.442
So, you don't know.

42:51.026 --> 42:52.695
- Know what?
- Sarah.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.739
He's alive.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.577
- My dad's alive.

43:02.204 --> 43:04.915
And... and he's here right now. Look.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.630
No, he was just right there.

43:11.630 --> 43:14.008
Sarah, I swear to God,
he was. He was here.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.136
- Dad!
- John B.

43:17.136 --> 43:20.848
No, no, Sarah. Hey.
Look, I... I promise he's here.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.725
Give me one second. Dad!

43:23.350 --> 43:25.686
- Hey, um--
- No, no, hold on. I promise you. Hold on.

43:25.686 --> 43:27.521
Dad! Hey, Dad!

43:29.023 --> 43:30.232
Dad!
