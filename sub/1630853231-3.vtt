00:26.360 --> 00:29.530
Once upon a time, there was a little girl.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.702
When she was young,
her mother would always say,

00:35.786 --> 00:38.997
"If I had to choose between
you being smart and you being beautiful,

00:39.081 --> 00:41.208
I'd choose beautiful every time."

00:43.126 --> 00:45.045
You look so beautiful, sweetie.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.382
You ready?

00:55.556 --> 00:56.723
Miss Florida.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.442
But of course, all little girls grow up…

01:10.654 --> 01:12.197
get boring day jobs…

01:23.417 --> 01:24.668
meet a man…

01:28.172 --> 01:29.423
fall in love…

01:36.096 --> 01:38.390
and move into his giant mansion together.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.519
-Is it all right?
-Yeah.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.771
Yeah, I saw you were coming
from my balcony up there.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.359
-And I could see you…
-It's a fairy tale really.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.586
Harry?

02:16.470 --> 02:17.471
Harry?

02:27.940 --> 02:28.941
Harry?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.488
Oh, my Go-- What are you doing?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.325
Ta-da!

02:39.117 --> 02:40.494
Wow.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.122
I mean, did you--
I had no idea you were so handy.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.624
Well, I was inspired.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.795
Usually, I'd bring someone in,
but I wanted to build this myself.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.172
Bravo.

02:52.256 --> 02:56.510
Is it for your golf trophies
or for books that I haven't seen?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.596
No. It's for you.

03:01.098 --> 03:04.351
Baby. You're so sweet.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.188
But, babe, I--

03:08.272 --> 03:11.984
I have a few more shoes
than are gonna fit on this shelf.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.863
-We're gonna need a couple more shelves.
-Well, it's not for your stuff.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.114
Okay.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.198
It's for you.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.998
See, I tested all the other walls,
and this one is by far the best.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.500
-It's got a perfect view of the pool, and…
-Okay.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.171
…and me.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.886
Look, if I could just gaze up at you
whenever I wanted,

03:39.428 --> 03:41.763
it would make me feel invincible.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.391
I could launch a hundred businesses

03:44.474 --> 03:49.229
because every time I would look up at you,
I would always remember what I have.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.064
Right.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.150
And never lose sight
of what it's all about.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.071
You want me to sit on the shelf?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.489
Yes.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.995
But I have a job. Harry. I mean, I--

04:05.704 --> 04:06.705
Quit.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.957
Yeah. I don't think
that I can just not work.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.376
Why not? You hate modeling.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.880
You always complain about how
the photographers are creepy

04:14.963 --> 04:16.255
and the hours are abusive.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.050
I mean, yeah, but that--

04:18.132 --> 04:21.595
I guess that's a kind of--
It won't always be like that.

04:22.513 --> 04:28.393
Baby, you are just too extraordinary
to live an ordinary life.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.480
So, fuck it.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.234
-Yeah?
-Well, I--

04:37.444 --> 04:41.114
I-- Let's just say that I'm up there,
okay, living my best life.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.075
What are you gonna do? You're just gonna--

04:44.576 --> 04:46.537
-Just gonna worship me?
-Exactly.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.165
-Come on.
-You think this is a joke,

04:50.249 --> 04:51.959
but I promise I will make sure

04:52.042 --> 04:55.170
that you never have to worry
about anything ever again.

04:56.922 --> 05:01.635
-What are other people gonna say?
-Who cares? This is about us.

05:03.011 --> 05:07.140
All you have to do is sit here
and be loved.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.602
Let me do that for you.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.814
It would make me
the happiest man on Earth.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.366
Yes. I guess. Yes, I could try.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.659
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yes?

05:25.742 --> 05:26.827
Okay.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.454
Well, may I?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.081
Okay.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.209
All right. Watch your step.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.377
Okay.

05:39.548 --> 05:40.966
-You okay?
-Yeah.

05:46.805 --> 05:47.806
Wow.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.897
Do you need a pillow?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.610
No, I'm-- I'm-- Yeah, I want a pillow.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.736
Anything you need.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.572
Yeah.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.621
-Coming right up.
-Thank you.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.002
That's a pretty nice view…

06:19.588 --> 06:20.714
of a pretty nice life.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.798
Yeah.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.762
Yeah.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.491
Hi, baby.

06:48.534 --> 06:49.535
Hello.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.163
Can I get you anything from the kitchen?

06:56.124 --> 06:59.419
Breakfast would be nice. I'm starving.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.796
Me too.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.889
-Orange juice?
-Yes, please.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.524
Okay.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.876
Almost ready.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.212
Okay.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.766
-For you.
-Thank you.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.477
-I'm gonna give a toast.
-Okay.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.562
-Okay?
-Go, go.

07:58.645 --> 08:02.733
It's driven me crazy.
My insatiable drive to…

08:06.153 --> 08:07.237
To Amelia.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.836
Yeah. No, I'm still here.

09:04.545 --> 09:11.176
Look, can you hold on a moment?
I need to confer with my associate.

09:14.513 --> 09:20.269
Sorry. Am I distracting you
from all your business?

09:20.352 --> 09:23.021
Are you kidding?
They're distracting me from you.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.775
Go, go.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.367
Happy birthday, baby.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.287
It is not my birthday.
My birthday's in Octo-- Oh, my God!

09:38.996 --> 09:40.289
Well, I figured, why wait?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.427
Happy Bastille Day.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.638
Harry? What? We're not French.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.974
Don't you dare tell our decorator.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.310
Wow.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.104
Thank you!

10:04.188 --> 10:05.564
Look how good they look.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.900
No present today?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.279
A kiss is still a very thoughtful gift.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.282
It's kind of better than jewelry
if you ask me.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.362
Morning, darling.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.446
Morning.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.503
How was your sleep?

11:52.462 --> 11:54.464
How do-- How was your sleep?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.258
-Good.
-Good.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.685
You look so handsome today.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.959
-Honey.
-Okay.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.510
I-- I'm--

12:54.942 --> 12:56.109
Look at me.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.642
Over here.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.770
Let's flip it around.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.898
One person on each side.
I'll get the chair. Okay.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.279
-Sorry, wait. No, sorry. I c--
-All right, that's it.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.363
Good.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.909
Harry. Harry, what are you--
What's going on? I mean, what--

13:46.451 --> 13:49.663
Change of scenery.
Natural light's better for my eyes.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.333
Okay.

14:59.775 --> 15:00.901
Harry?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.114
Harry?

15:41.525 --> 15:43.694
I don't think I can do this anymore.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.990
I-- I think we should go--

15:50.951 --> 15:53.871
I think we should like--

15:55.205 --> 15:56.540
I think we should try.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.095
Oh, my God.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.173
Oh, my God.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.512
Okay.

19:21.245 --> 19:23.997
Harry, I'm going out!

19:48.814 --> 19:50.607
-Hi!
-Hi!

20:11.753 --> 20:15.716
Hi! Hello! Hi, I'm Amelia.
Is that your Vespa?

20:30.939 --> 20:31.982
Whoo!

20:35.694 --> 20:36.695
Whoo!

22:03.407 --> 22:04.700
Whoo!

22:40.485 --> 22:41.653
I love it here.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.162
I've never been to the beach.
Isn't that crazy?

22:55.334 --> 22:57.961
Do you guys have
an extra towel that I could use?

22:59.296 --> 23:01.048
No. Sorry.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.385
Well--

23:13.143 --> 23:14.144
Hi.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.980
-Sorry. I was staring.
-That's okay.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.233
I was gonna see if you needed any help,

25:24.316 --> 25:26.276
but it looks like
you have it all under control.

25:28.529 --> 25:33.200
I think I just needed to f-freshen up.
I d-- Is that okay?

25:33.283 --> 25:35.994
Oh, yeah, sure. U-Use whatever you like.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.121
I'm just taking notes.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.250
It took me years
to learn how to apply concealer.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.794
Are you a makeup artist?

25:44.294 --> 25:45.420
No, no.

25:45.504 --> 25:47.214
What do you do?

25:47.297 --> 25:49.967
So, I c-- I…

25:52.386 --> 25:53.428
sit…

25:56.265 --> 26:01.562
For a very wealthy man… like a trophy.

26:04.273 --> 26:08.235
Well, so long as you're happy, huh?
That's what my mother always said.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.529
Well, that's nice. My mother always said,

26:10.612 --> 26:13.282
"If I had to choose between you
being smart and you being beautiful,

26:13.365 --> 26:15.742
I would choose beautiful every time." So…

26:17.077 --> 26:19.037
Well, lucky for you,
you don't have to choose.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.626
I never thought of that.

26:26.295 --> 26:29.715
-What?
-What-- What you just said.

26:31.008 --> 26:32.301
I'm just making conversation.

26:32.801 --> 26:35.304
But I'm happy that you find me so helpful.

26:35.846 --> 26:37.222
My daughter thinks I'm an idiot.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.142
Yeah, and she hates makeup.
Like, hates it.

26:40.225 --> 26:43.187
When I put on eyelashes,
she says I look like Tammy Faye Bakker.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.691
I don't know who that is.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.526
Of course you don't. You're too young.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.946
The bottom line is,
people can be very judgy.

26:54.573 --> 26:55.574
But you're not.

26:57.034 --> 26:59.369
Jordan. Thank you.

26:59.453 --> 27:00.704
Sure.

27:03.916 --> 27:08.462
Can I ring anything up for you?
I work on commission.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.298
I don't have any money.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.710
You guys in line for concert tickets?

29:12.294 --> 29:13.545
No, it's a store opening.

29:14.046 --> 29:17.257
Who stands in line for a store opening?
That's fucking stupid.

29:22.638 --> 29:23.847
Wow, you look beautiful.

29:25.307 --> 29:27.351
Pamela, beautiful work.

29:29.186 --> 29:33.857
Hey, Kelsey, I think soon we're gonna
be out of the Sunset Kitten gloss.

29:33.941 --> 29:36.568
If you could--
You don't have to do it now, just--

29:36.652 --> 29:38.820
I think we're running out,
which is a good thing.

29:40.864 --> 29:43.951
Hi. Welcome to my store.

30:00.425 --> 30:01.760
Why is she on a shelf?

30:02.261 --> 30:04.555
I don't know. Maybe she likes it up there.

30:05.806 --> 30:07.391
Can I be on a shelf one day?

30:08.058 --> 30:09.476
Not a chance.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.147
Hi.

30:15.357 --> 30:16.650
You're so pretty.

30:17.609 --> 30:18.694
Thank you.

30:20.404 --> 30:21.572
Bye.

30:21.655 --> 30:22.906
You know, it's not all--

30:37.129 --> 30:38.172
Hi. Welcome.

30:41.341 --> 30:42.634
Hi.
