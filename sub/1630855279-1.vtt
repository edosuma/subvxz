WEBVTT

00:57.666 --> 00:59.189
Woo!

00:59.233 --> 01:01.539
So, most of you guys
know me as Kid Kut,

01:01.583 --> 01:04.455
the voice of the vibe, the MC
from the Baby Blue Soundcrew.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.631
When I say "baby,"
y'all say "blue!"

01:06.675 --> 01:07.850
Baby!
Blue!

01:07.893 --> 01:09.069
-Baby...
-Blue!

01:09.112 --> 01:10.200
-Baby...
-Blue!

01:10.244 --> 01:11.419
-Baby...
-Blue!

01:11.462 --> 01:12.811
But...

01:12.855 --> 01:15.466
little do you know,
I am a vinyl collector,

01:15.510 --> 01:17.338
a producer, a DJ.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.991
I love vinyl.

01:19.035 --> 01:22.299
This record right here
was one of the first records

01:22.343 --> 01:23.822
I purchased.

01:23.866 --> 01:26.216
Any time I bought a record
or records in the past,

01:26.260 --> 01:28.131
any time I bought records
in the past,

01:28.175 --> 01:32.701
I would purchase the record
and put my name on the record

01:32.744 --> 01:35.791
and I would put the year
that I got the vinyl.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.576
So, like, if I was playing
a party and somehow

01:38.620 --> 01:41.753
one of my records got, you know,

01:41.797 --> 01:44.147
taken up by somebody else accidentally...

01:45.801 --> 01:47.585
I could be like,
"That's my record!"

01:47.629 --> 01:49.935
The records that are in here
actually mean something to me.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.720
And when I purchased this home,

01:51.763 --> 01:53.635
the whole thing was
there's a spot under the stairs.

01:53.678 --> 01:56.072
That's why the roof
is only this high.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.901
I made sure, I was like,
"Yup, that's where I'm gonna

01:58.944 --> 02:02.644
"put my vinyl, in this spot,
and I can lock it up."

02:02.687 --> 02:05.864
<i>♪ Do it...

02:05.908 --> 02:08.476
There's one store
that's very special to me.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.608
Every time I go there,
I'm always inspired,

02:10.652 --> 02:12.741
whether
it's a sample or a break.

02:12.784 --> 02:15.222
Yo, let's go get some new vinyl.

03:23.812 --> 03:26.249
You always say that you just

03:26.293 --> 03:28.469
had the right people around you.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.122
But, I mean,
bigger than that, right?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.603
I mean,
this is about a love of music.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.083
Yes.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.737
And this
turned into what people

03:35.780 --> 03:37.129
are calling a cultural artifact.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.828
When you hear that,
what does it make you think?

03:39.871 --> 03:42.091
I know for people,
they always talk about it

03:42.134 --> 03:44.963
on the internet,
when they come here, they tell--

03:45.007 --> 03:47.488
because I've served,
like, three generations.

03:47.531 --> 03:51.274
Father, then the son;
now the son has little kids,

03:51.318 --> 03:53.015
and they're bringing them in.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.365
I love to see those kids,
you know?

03:55.409 --> 03:58.194
And they tell
their kids the stories,

03:58.238 --> 04:01.328
"Oh, this is vinyl,
so-and-so, that's a CD.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.461
"Long time ago, Thursday,
we'd come, we'd fight in records

04:04.505 --> 04:07.116
"with other DJs,"
all this stuff, you know?

04:07.159 --> 04:08.422
I mean, they tell
them stories like that.

04:08.465 --> 04:09.727
It was good.

04:09.771 --> 04:12.513
It was like a meeting place
every Thursday.

04:18.823 --> 04:21.261
Being immersed
in that world was just...

04:21.304 --> 04:23.654
It's hard to articulate
sometimes some of the things

04:23.698 --> 04:25.743
that I experienced.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.789
Just seeing the unity of people,

04:27.832 --> 04:29.921
DJs, people from
all walks of life,

04:29.965 --> 04:33.969
showing up on a Thursday.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.232
We created
the soundtrack for this time.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.451
This was the meeting place.

04:37.494 --> 04:40.845
It was communal,
and it was live, and...

04:40.889 --> 04:43.152
It was alive.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.810
If you were a DJ in this
city, like, everybody was there.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.246
It was packed.
You couldn't...

04:50.290 --> 04:51.726
There was times you just
couldn't even move in there.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.380
It was just...

04:53.423 --> 04:55.730
Everybody was going to him
and he was the go-to guy,

04:55.773 --> 04:58.341
and it kind of didn't matter
who you were in the industry,

04:58.385 --> 05:00.300
whether you're a promoter,
whether you're a DJ,

05:00.343 --> 05:01.736
whether you're an artist.

05:01.779 --> 05:04.956
You needed Eugene.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.878
You know,
I never thought about it,

05:13.922 --> 05:16.968
but when we were doing
this documentary,

05:17.012 --> 05:20.755
and then I wrote stuff on paper,

05:20.798 --> 05:22.409
and then I realized,

05:22.452 --> 05:23.845
"Maybe we did."

05:23.888 --> 05:25.716
I'm always so busy,
I'm always doing something,

05:25.760 --> 05:27.588
I'm always exercising,

05:27.631 --> 05:30.068
I'm always with my mom and dad,
trying to help them out,

05:30.112 --> 05:31.983
doing something,
or my family, right?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.985
And so I never think
about all these things.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.291
And people would always tell me,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.685
"Oh, your store
is an institution, duh duh duh."

05:37.728 --> 05:39.948
I was like, "Okay, alright,
alright, okay, cool,

05:39.991 --> 05:41.602
"no problem."

05:41.645 --> 05:45.127
But it's only when we started
doing this documentary, I...

05:45.170 --> 05:48.260
"Oh, maybe we did have
something to do with it."

05:48.304 --> 05:49.914
You know what I mean?
I never saw it.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.090
Like, you know when
you have to step back?

05:55.398 --> 05:57.792
Then you see
the picture, right?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.584

07:21.049 --> 07:23.181
And I would
buy bootleg records

07:23.225 --> 07:26.141
of Lord Finesse
and digging in the crates,

07:26.184 --> 07:27.621
because they were
just too expensive

07:27.664 --> 07:29.710
and the records weren't
that good to begin with so...

07:29.753 --> 07:33.583
Oh, hey, Finesse!
What's up?

08:33.034 --> 08:35.993
Yeah, there's a lot
of history from the old location

08:36.037 --> 08:40.650
that we transferred
across to this location.

08:40.694 --> 08:43.871
Roy Ayers, well, he's-- so many
people sampled this guy, right?

08:43.914 --> 08:45.437
And he's so big.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.310
They approached us
and they wanted to do a signing

08:48.353 --> 08:50.617
in the store and we said,
"Okay, cool, no problem."

08:50.660 --> 08:52.183
He came early.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.576
He set up everything.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.274
He would see people coming
straight from the door

08:56.318 --> 08:58.015
and be calling them,
"Hey, come!"

08:58.059 --> 09:00.061
You know, he doesn't even know
if they're coming for him

09:00.104 --> 09:01.889
or not, he's just calling them.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.892
Maestro is like the first one
that opened the doors

09:04.935 --> 09:06.284
for everybody, too, right?

09:06.328 --> 09:09.026
And then, he happened to be
coming through here.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.811
Like, all these guys
used to come through

09:10.854 --> 09:12.290
the store all the time, right?

09:12.334 --> 09:14.815
I used to see them all the time,
so it was no big deal.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.992
But then, I said it would be
cool for him to just sign it.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.951
Actually, I think ABBA
was one of my first records

09:20.995 --> 09:23.954
that I bought, like actually
go and paid money...

09:25.303 --> 09:27.741
Instead of getting
records from my dad.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.525
ABBA.
But this is not the right one,

09:29.569 --> 09:31.266
but this is one.

09:31.309 --> 09:34.748
ABBA, I remember,
was hot at that time and-- pfft!

09:34.791 --> 09:36.706
We were all dancing to it.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.012
Dancing!

09:38.055 --> 09:40.275
"Dancing Queen."

09:40.318 --> 09:45.454
I have these 45s here,
brought from back home.

09:45.497 --> 09:48.631
Well, this is just some of it,
but it was a lot of 45s.

09:48.675 --> 09:52.243
Me and my brother,
we bought 45s,

09:52.287 --> 09:55.551
and this is what we
used to listen to, man.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.036
We grew up
in Trinidad in Port of Spain,

10:02.079 --> 10:04.778
Belmont, Erthig Road.

10:04.821 --> 10:08.346
My mom and dad had a business
there selling groceries.

10:08.390 --> 10:11.088
We had certain
exclusive products

10:11.132 --> 10:12.524
for the whole of Trinidad.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.310
And that's how he made
his living and, you know,

10:15.353 --> 10:16.703
made some of his money, right?

10:16.746 --> 10:18.226
I just remember
when I was young,

10:18.269 --> 10:20.881
just going down there
right after school,

10:20.924 --> 10:23.231
running around, playing there,

10:23.274 --> 10:27.888
and maybe that's how I got
my business sense or whatever.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.676
I remember he had a friend.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.331
She had all the jukeboxes.

10:36.374 --> 10:39.334
She owned a lot of jukeboxes
around Trinidad,

10:39.377 --> 10:41.989
and she came to my dad
and said, like,

10:42.032 --> 10:43.686
"I have so many
thousands of records.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.515
"Do you want to take them?"
And they negotiated a price.

10:46.558 --> 10:49.039
Next day when we had
the records, man, I was like...

10:50.345 --> 10:51.738
Get into the music there.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.088
I started getting
records for free.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.786
I came across to Canada
to study,

10:56.830 --> 11:00.268
and I guessed after I finished
studying I would come back

11:00.311 --> 11:01.486
and take over the business, right?

11:01.530 --> 11:04.054
But then, my brother
came and studied,

11:04.098 --> 11:06.100
then my sister came,

11:06.143 --> 11:08.624
and then my dad just came.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.366
He took a two-day holiday.
He never takes a holiday.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.934
He took a two-day holiday,
came down to Canada,

11:13.977 --> 11:17.067
and he loved it and he said,
"We're moving."

11:19.766 --> 11:22.507
<i>Years ago,
Huron Indians named this city</i>

11:22.551 --> 11:25.989
<i>their word for "meeting place,"
Toronto.</i>

11:26.033 --> 11:29.036
<i>Today, a very big
meeting place.</i>

11:35.564 --> 11:38.436
Ask any DJ
or music lover

11:38.480 --> 11:40.656
what they tend to do
when they travel to new cities,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.440
what's always on the agenda?

11:42.484 --> 11:46.618
Record stores.

11:46.662 --> 11:50.666
Tuning into a city's, not just
club culture but music culture,

11:50.710 --> 11:53.625
record stores have long been
at the heart of that.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.671
I stayed here for,
like, about a month

11:55.715 --> 11:58.282
and went record shopping.

12:01.851 --> 12:05.420
Sam the Record Man,
Cheapies, A&A Records.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.988
Later on,
I was buying at Star Sound

12:08.031 --> 12:10.077
and Carnival Records.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.777
Star Sound was actually
<i>the</i> record store to go to

12:14.821 --> 12:16.474
in the '80s.

12:16.518 --> 12:19.086
I remember seeing, you know,
guys from Club Z, Twilight Zone;

12:19.129 --> 12:22.393
all those guys were there
buying records.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.786
It was a social gathering too.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.875
You got to meet and greet,
you know?

12:25.919 --> 12:27.790
"I never thought I'd meet
this DJ; he's here,"

12:27.834 --> 12:31.359
that kind of thing.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.796
When I
had that experience

12:33.840 --> 12:35.972
going to Star Sound, that
was like one of my first

12:36.016 --> 12:38.279
"Wow!" moments that,
"Oh my god, this is real."

12:38.322 --> 12:39.933
I didn't know that
was gonna happen,

12:39.976 --> 12:43.066
but they had my posters
everywhere and it was like,

12:43.110 --> 12:45.852
in my mind, "Wow, this is what
LL Cool J must have felt like

12:45.895 --> 12:48.202
"when he came out with,
you know, Rock the Bells."

12:48.245 --> 12:50.378
Definitely good for me
in terms of giving me

12:50.421 --> 12:52.336
that confidence to know
that my city is behind me,

12:52.380 --> 12:55.470
so enough respect
to Star Sound for that.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.212
You know, you felt
this loyalty to Star Sound

12:58.255 --> 13:00.518
and Carnival, and then when
Star Sound changed to Traxx,

13:00.562 --> 13:02.172
my loyalty was at Carnival.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.479
And because Kamal from Carnival
let me work there

13:04.522 --> 13:07.351
on Caribana weekend in 1990,

13:07.395 --> 13:10.137
I felt a distinct
loyalty to him.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.878
Because he paid me in records!

13:15.446 --> 13:17.535
And the horn!

13:17.579 --> 13:19.711
As the music scene
and the record scene

13:19.755 --> 13:22.149
became more commercialized,
it just wasn't enough.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.586
Star Sound just wasn't enough,
you know?

13:24.629 --> 13:26.457
And everything
would get sold out.

13:26.501 --> 13:30.287
There just wouldn't be enough
for regular guys like me,

13:30.331 --> 13:32.376
you know, buying records.

13:32.420 --> 13:35.858
Play De Record came
at the right time, I think.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.338
He dabbled
in different things,

13:37.381 --> 13:40.732
and I think he wanted
to do something retail,

13:40.776 --> 13:43.866
and it was just a natural
progression with music

13:43.910 --> 13:46.913
that he loved,
and I guess there was only a few

13:46.956 --> 13:48.523
record stores on Yonge Street.

13:48.566 --> 13:52.483
And then my dad had
the property on Yonge Street.

13:52.527 --> 13:56.313
The back was empty
for two years.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.011
He may have told you,

13:58.054 --> 14:00.578
because his dad
owned the building,

14:00.622 --> 14:04.278
and the back part was very
hard to rent out at that time,

14:04.321 --> 14:05.801
in 1990.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.759
And there were
other record stores.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.284
Like, everyone shopped
along Yonge Street.

14:10.327 --> 14:15.028
He loved music and, you know,
he wanted to use the back.

14:19.336 --> 14:22.296
You know, nobody
wanted to rent behind a store.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.124
Like, who would do that?

14:24.167 --> 14:26.474
You know what I mean?
Only me.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.791
So I said,
"Dad, look, this--

14:39.835 --> 14:41.445
"nobody's gonna rent there.

14:41.489 --> 14:45.754
"Let's just open
a record store there, right?"

14:45.797 --> 14:47.669
And my mom and him
said, like,

14:47.712 --> 14:50.672
"Okay, let's try it out."

14:50.715 --> 14:52.282
Record buyers,

14:52.326 --> 14:54.589
they see any
new place that's open,

14:54.632 --> 14:56.373
they want to go check it out.

14:56.417 --> 14:59.072
So, and we were on the correct,
you know, in the right area,

14:59.115 --> 15:03.728
so we got people shopping
as soon as we opened.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.034
Even when
we opened the store,

15:05.078 --> 15:06.644
we didn't even have
a name really.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.516
People would say,
"What do you call your store?"

15:08.559 --> 15:10.997
You know?
And I just said, "Well...

15:11.040 --> 15:12.563
"how about Play De Record, man?"

15:12.607 --> 15:15.305
Right, like "Play De Record."
And that was it.

15:19.048 --> 15:22.704
I mean, I didn't know how to
open a record store or whatever,

15:22.747 --> 15:25.533
I just knew
the music that I know,

15:25.576 --> 15:28.362
R&B, some jazz, Latin,

15:28.405 --> 15:30.277
soca, and reggae, right?

15:30.320 --> 15:33.410
So I opened up the store
with only that kind of music.

15:33.454 --> 15:37.066
One of the DJs that used to
come and shop, his name is Deko.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.938
He liked what we were
doing and he said,

15:38.981 --> 15:41.592
"Look, you need to get
some house and techno

15:41.636 --> 15:43.986
"and other types
of music in here,

15:44.030 --> 15:45.292
"and you'll do well."

15:45.335 --> 15:47.859
He gave me
a contact in Montreal,

15:47.903 --> 15:49.818
so I called that guy up.

15:49.861 --> 15:53.822
"Look, whatever you think
is the hottest stuff,

15:53.865 --> 15:56.564
"just send it to me,"
so he sent me some stuff.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.174
People buying.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.829
We were bringing drum and bass,
and people were coming down

16:00.872 --> 16:05.181
like, "Oh, wow...
this is stuff that nobody has.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.010
"You can only get it in the UK."
He hooked me up good.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.534
And, pssht!

16:10.578 --> 16:13.494
That's how the store, like,
we started getting, like,

16:13.537 --> 16:17.454
the latest stuff
and all the DJ stuff.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.239
Club DJs were coming in

16:19.282 --> 16:21.545
because we had stuff
that nobody had.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.377
It was this whole
kind of mom-and-pop corner store

16:27.421 --> 16:29.205
in the front, so you'd walk in,
you're like,

16:29.249 --> 16:30.598
"Am I at the right place?"

16:30.641 --> 16:32.382
You hear there's this
cool new record store,

16:32.426 --> 16:34.167
and then you walk in
and you're like, "What?!"

16:34.210 --> 16:36.517
As soon as you
walk into Play De Record

16:36.560 --> 16:38.127
it immediately
becomes this grimy,

16:38.171 --> 16:41.043
kind of bodega experience where
there's a convenience store

16:41.087 --> 16:42.566
before you walk
into Play De Record.

16:42.610 --> 16:46.396
Play De Record was
in the back half of 357.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.574
There would be, like, brass
knuckles and porno tapes and,

16:50.618 --> 16:52.620
you know, all types of stuff
that's completely unrelated

16:52.663 --> 16:54.535
with records.

16:54.578 --> 16:57.233
Eugene and Donna
are very warm,

16:57.277 --> 17:00.410
nice, cool, loving people.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.718
And then, of course,
there were Eugene's parents

17:03.761 --> 17:06.677
that were there,
both his mom and dad.

17:06.721 --> 17:10.116
Dad was super tough and scary.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.074
My dad was
a bit of the security guard,

17:12.118 --> 17:14.033
and my mom was
just there to make sure

17:14.076 --> 17:15.904
that things were
running smoothly.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.688
Maybe he thinks
he's still in Trinidad.

17:17.732 --> 17:18.907
You know what I mean?

17:18.950 --> 17:21.170
Because of people
stealing or whatever.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.867
It doesn't matter who.
You know what I mean?

17:22.911 --> 17:25.522
He's always checking,
oh, the bags.

17:25.566 --> 17:26.610
Make sure people...

17:26.654 --> 17:28.786
Because there
was people stealing.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.701
We caught
a couple of people already.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.964
The front of
the store is selling everything

17:33.008 --> 17:35.967
from, like, pornographic movies
and, you know,

17:36.011 --> 17:38.709
fake handguns and daggers
and, like,

17:38.753 --> 17:42.539
all kinds of crap that you would
expect in a kind of sleazy

17:42.583 --> 17:44.237
Yonge Street type of store.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.716
You know what I mean?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.805
And we know certain people
are coming to steal, too.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.112
I mean, now,
it doesn't happen that often

17:50.156 --> 17:53.115
because people don't care
about music that much.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.508
Like, you can get it for free.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.598
But at that time,
the only way you can get music

17:57.641 --> 17:59.469
is you've got to come
to the record store.

17:59.513 --> 18:02.646
The parents were
the best and the meanest,

18:02.690 --> 18:04.909
but then I eventually
won his mother over.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.522
I would be so nice to her
all the time,

18:08.565 --> 18:10.350
that she eventually would smile
at me and I was like,

18:10.393 --> 18:12.003
"Wow, I did it!

18:12.047 --> 18:16.399
"I slayed the dragon!"

18:16.443 --> 18:19.359
My mom, dad,
Donna was there,

18:19.402 --> 18:22.362
and my brother came
and helped out sometimes,

18:22.405 --> 18:24.712
and my sister came
and helped out sometimes.

18:24.755 --> 18:27.149
We were by ourselves.

18:27.193 --> 18:30.239
And then I said, "Man,
we'd better get somebody.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.154
"We've gotta get some DJs

18:32.198 --> 18:33.938
"or somebody
that knows other people."

18:33.982 --> 18:36.506
I was just hanging out
at this local record shop

18:36.550 --> 18:38.465
called Carnival, and there was
a guy that was working there,

18:38.508 --> 18:40.162
Eric Ling.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.729
He said, "There's a new
record shop that just opened

18:41.772 --> 18:43.992
"down the street and they've
got import house music."

18:44.035 --> 18:45.602
I walked into Play De Record.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.649
I still remember, they only had
about 100 records in the store.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.042
I met Eugene and,
"Oh, you like music?"

18:51.086 --> 18:52.435
And I said, "Yeah."

18:52.479 --> 18:54.394
"And you like house music?"
And I said, "Yeah."

18:54.437 --> 18:56.570
"You want to work here?"
And I said, "Sure!"

18:56.613 --> 18:58.441
And he goes, "Start tomorrow?"
And I said, "Okay!"

18:58.485 --> 19:01.966
So that's how I got the job.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.186
You know, Star Sound, Carnival,
and Play De Record,

19:04.230 --> 19:08.669
they were very different from
shops like Sam's and A&A.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.846
Sam the Record Man
was more commercial.

19:11.889 --> 19:14.718
They sell classical,
jazz, rock, right?

19:14.762 --> 19:18.722
I focused mostly on DJ,
urban music, electronic music.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.202
That was my thing.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.551
In the good old days,

19:21.595 --> 19:24.728
and I say that
sort of like in parenthesis,

19:24.772 --> 19:27.601
all that music,
let's call it Black music,

19:27.644 --> 19:31.996
so disco, R&B, house,

19:32.040 --> 19:35.391
hip-hop,
that was all dance music.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.699
Playing hip-hop,
funk, R&B, reggae,

19:38.742 --> 19:40.701
was how I started as a DJ.

19:40.744 --> 19:44.487
And then over time,
house music was invented.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.620
I gravitated in that direction.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.622
House was, like,
slowly building and building

19:48.665 --> 19:54.018
and building, and that was,
like, the club thing.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.368
That was the house thing.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.717
And there was
a girl in my class,

19:56.760 --> 19:59.415
this girl named Sherry Assoon,

19:59.459 --> 20:03.027
and her brother had owned
the Twilight Zone nightclub.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.508
Like, I didn't know
nothing about, like,

20:05.552 --> 20:07.510
clubs or anything, right?

20:07.554 --> 20:09.947
So she goes, "Oh, yeah, I could
bring you there one time."

20:09.991 --> 20:12.254
And we go to this club
and I was just like,

20:12.298 --> 20:14.996
"Wow, this is crazy.
Like, what is this?"

20:15.039 --> 20:17.477
And just, like, you'd never
seen anything like this ever,

20:17.520 --> 20:19.827
and I was just like--
like, the sound's insane.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.046
Everything's, like,
music I never heard before.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.745
I mean, I don't know how long
I ended up staying there.

20:24.788 --> 20:27.835
Of course, you're 13 and...

20:27.878 --> 20:29.576
You're 13 or whatever,
sneaking out of the house

20:29.619 --> 20:31.926
and so on, but yeah,
I was like--

20:31.969 --> 20:34.102
that's where the whole
house thing started from,

20:34.145 --> 20:35.756
the Twilight Zone.

20:43.024 --> 20:45.983
I grew up just outside
of a town called Cobourg.

20:46.027 --> 20:48.072
I grew up in a little town
called Grafton.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.857
I mean,
I totally did not get it!

20:49.900 --> 20:51.424
I walked in.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.730
I mean, it was sparse,
like very little lighting.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.297
It was mostly strobes.

20:55.341 --> 20:59.301
It was, you know, screens
and lasers and things flashing.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.998
And, like, what I didn't
understand musically

21:01.042 --> 21:02.826
at the time, ironically
because it became so much

21:02.870 --> 21:05.089
a part of my life.

21:05.133 --> 21:09.877
<i>♪ Feel the drums.</i>

21:09.920 --> 21:11.922
It was definitely
early, early, early

21:11.966 --> 21:13.576
underground house
and early underground techno

21:13.620 --> 21:16.405
and the meeting of that.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.016
The whole vibe of that
and the fact that you could be

21:19.060 --> 21:20.627
on a floor dancing
beside somebody

21:20.670 --> 21:22.716
you've never seen before and
smiling your face off at them

21:22.759 --> 21:24.587
all night
because it was just new.

21:24.631 --> 21:28.896
It was fresh.
And it meant a lot.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.986
It connected people.
It still does.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.380
Just the sound system,
it's incredible here.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.077
The people are friendly.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.471
The atmosphere,
the music, it's alright.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.821
It's fun!

21:40.864 --> 21:44.128
Well,
Toronto was starting to grow.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.479
The popularity
for underground music

21:46.522 --> 21:49.003
is starting to grow in the city,

21:49.046 --> 21:52.311
and the clubbing
was starting to grow,

21:52.354 --> 21:56.184
which was amazing at that time.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.969
Dino & Terry,
Deko, Jason Steele

21:59.013 --> 22:00.580
was out there playing.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.277
Kenny Glasgow was coming up.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.279
He was young but he was
definitely coming up.

22:04.323 --> 22:09.023
Definitely Peter, Tyrone & Shams
were names I heard early on.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.286
Of course, Peter,
Tyrone & Shams were, like,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.636
the kings
of the house music world.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.812
Those guys,
they lived for music.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.901
They think music all day long.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.339
They want to get
the records early.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.515
That's it with these guys.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.168
Nightclubs
started to open up

22:24.212 --> 22:26.040
and DJs were getting jobs.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.259
They started to come
on a regular basis

22:28.303 --> 22:30.392
because they had a gig.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.613
At the time, he was
using an amazing distributor

22:33.656 --> 22:35.832
that nobody was using.

22:35.876 --> 22:39.619
So with that, it just...

22:39.662 --> 22:41.795
Just had good
12-inches coming in.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.840
By that time,
I was getting all of my stuff

22:43.884 --> 22:45.233
from Play De Record.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.930
I had a great relationship
with Play De Record.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.324
Eugene was an amazing
guy to work with,

22:49.368 --> 22:51.979
so there was no reason
for me to go anywhere else.

22:52.022 --> 22:55.112
They knew what they
were doing in terms of how to

22:55.156 --> 22:58.377
supply the city with
all things kind of music.

22:58.420 --> 23:02.598
And also, they stood out because
they included and sold music

23:02.642 --> 23:04.731
in so many genres
right from the start.

23:04.774 --> 23:07.995
I really
tried to push new music

23:08.038 --> 23:10.476
and push Canadian stuff,

23:10.519 --> 23:14.175
and push, you know, local stuff,
and good music,

23:14.218 --> 23:18.179
good new music, underground,
nothing that was commercial.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.050
Interesting stuff.

23:20.094 --> 23:23.140
You know, different languages,
different beats.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.577
It doesn't matter what.

23:24.620 --> 23:27.884
<i>Rap, talking
to music in a hip style.</i>

23:27.928 --> 23:29.799
<i>It started in the streets
of New York,</i>

23:29.843 --> 23:31.540
<i>crossed over
into the pop charts,</i>

23:31.584 --> 23:33.716
<i>and now rap
is growing in Canada.</i>

23:33.760 --> 23:35.718
This past summer,
people with the record chains

23:35.762 --> 23:38.329
noticed an increasing
demand for rap.

23:38.373 --> 23:41.158
Customers came in
looking for specific artists.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.073
They also were looking for
whatever was new

23:43.117 --> 23:45.511
in the realm of rap.

24:50.532 --> 24:53.753
All I can say about
hip-hop is that hip-hop is me.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.624
You know what I mean?
I can't control it.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.844
It's just taken control of me.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.716
I'll just--
I'll leave it at that.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.154
I got started
probably around 1985.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.243
Moved right into
the breakdance era.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.680
Tried different stuff.

25:07.723 --> 25:09.986
I tried dancing, I tried
like, you know, the fashion,

25:10.030 --> 25:13.860
this and that, and I ended up
being drawn to the music.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.210
My dad got us
a pair of turntables,

25:16.253 --> 25:18.604
not because they wanted us
to DJ or anything,

25:18.647 --> 25:20.954
but he just wanted us
to keep our sticky paws off

25:20.997 --> 25:22.564
of his prized possessions.

25:22.608 --> 25:26.873
And that basically just
developed my love for hip-hop,

25:26.916 --> 25:28.831
and I started listening
to Ron Nelson,

25:28.875 --> 25:33.662
The Fantastic Voyage on CKLN.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.099
There was
a kid that lived behind me.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.405
His name was Henderson.

25:37.448 --> 25:39.712
So I knock on Henderson's door
and, you know,

25:39.755 --> 25:41.496
Henderson's parents
were from Jamaica,

25:41.540 --> 25:43.585
and almost every time I'm
walking in the door, like,

25:43.629 --> 25:46.501
music's being played,
like on big, loud speakers.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.068
The first time
I ever heard hip-hop

25:48.111 --> 25:50.374
was in Henderson's home, right?

25:50.418 --> 25:52.594
We're going to school together
and I'm like, "What's that?"

25:52.638 --> 25:54.465
He's like, "You don't
know what that is?"

25:54.509 --> 25:57.338
And he's breaking, so I would
say the first introduction

25:57.381 --> 26:01.211
to the art form is breakdancing,
and to see somebody's body move

26:01.255 --> 26:03.823
in ways that you've
never seen it before.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.956
So let's remember, like,
this stuff is not on television.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.784
There is no YouTube.

26:08.828 --> 26:13.310
If you're not in person
seeing somebody move this way,

26:13.354 --> 26:15.574
you can't even explain it
to anybody else.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.663
And that was my
first introduction to it,

26:17.706 --> 26:18.968
and I've been hooked ever since.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.231
And I think the first time
you get introduced

26:21.275 --> 26:24.321
to one of the art forms,
it has a way of hooking you in.

26:24.365 --> 26:26.759
It's an undeniable thing
that draws you in.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.588
And for me, that's what did it.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.198
I grew up on
the four elements of hip-hop,

26:31.241 --> 26:33.243
and the four elements
of hip-hop,

26:33.287 --> 26:36.464
to quite Crazy Legs: graffiti
being the black sheep of hip-hop

26:36.507 --> 26:38.118
because it's the least understood,

26:38.161 --> 26:40.294
DJing being
the loyal child of hip-hop

26:40.337 --> 26:42.122
because it always does its job,

26:42.165 --> 26:45.168
MCing being
the spoiled child of hip-hop

26:45.212 --> 26:47.344
because it's the youngest
and it gets the most attention,

26:47.388 --> 26:49.608
and then my element, breakdancing,

26:49.651 --> 26:50.826
which is the bastard child
of hip-hop

26:50.870 --> 26:52.698
because there's
no father to its style.

If you're
passionate about something,

27:56.152 --> 28:00.243
your pursuit of knowledge
or seeking it is there, okay?

28:00.287 --> 28:01.636
Now, you can't
find it in the libraries.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.377
You can't find this anywhere.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.074
Obviously
there was no commercial radio.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.120
College radio was a thing.

28:07.163 --> 28:10.819
CIUT, CKLN.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.560
You gotta give respect
to Ron Nelson

28:12.603 --> 28:16.607
because he was
the pioneer to me.

28:16.651 --> 28:20.655
Not only did he have the
number one shows for hip-hop,

28:20.699 --> 28:23.136
but he was
a promoter of hip-hop.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.747
Roxanne Shanté
is in the place!

28:25.791 --> 28:28.271

28:36.192 --> 28:38.020
Back then, to be a DJ,

28:38.064 --> 28:39.587
you made your name
breaking records.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.371
"I'm the first one
to drop this record,"

28:41.415 --> 28:42.764
and that's how
you made a name.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.201
And Ron was the guy who was
dropping new records

28:45.245 --> 28:46.376
before anybody, right?

28:46.420 --> 28:48.335
So anybody who
went down to New York,

28:48.378 --> 28:49.902
you came back with stuff;

28:49.945 --> 28:52.818
you'd go right to Ron and
he'd break it on air for you.

28:52.861 --> 28:56.038
Like, he's a godfather
in the sense that he's the one

28:56.082 --> 28:58.388
with the vision
that's seen us going on

28:58.432 --> 28:59.694
and taking this to radio.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.218
He's like our red alert.

29:02.262 --> 29:03.872
<i>...it's
definitely live this year</i>

29:03.916 --> 29:05.178
<i>more than any other year,</i>

29:05.221 --> 29:07.006
<i>and it's good to see
the Canadian artists</i>

29:07.049 --> 29:08.790
<i>putting themselves on the map.</i>

29:08.834 --> 29:12.141
<i>"Elements of Style,"
that's gonna be a hit.</i>

29:12.185 --> 29:13.664
<i>I bet you any money
it's gonna be a hit,</i>

29:13.708 --> 29:15.797
<i>and that's on
the compilation record</i>

29:15.841 --> 29:18.234
<i>by Beat Factory Productions
and Streetbeat.</i>

29:18.278 --> 29:20.323
<i>Rumble & Strong's work
are in there</i>

29:20.367 --> 29:22.935
<i>as well as Street, uh--</i>

29:22.978 --> 29:24.937
<i>Streetbeat's stuff's
on the B side.</i>

29:24.980 --> 29:26.939
<i>What's this?
Toronto is on wax.</i>

29:26.982 --> 29:29.332
<i>Yeah, we know it, and it's
only gonna get better.</i>

29:29.376 --> 29:31.857
<i>The new Kenny Crush
on its way down...</i>

29:44.608 --> 29:48.351
The landscape
for Toronto urban radio

29:48.395 --> 29:51.964
at the time was there really
was no Canadian urban radio.

29:52.007 --> 29:55.445
WBLK from Buffalo
was our urban radio.

29:55.489 --> 29:58.057
We loved it.
We couldn't get enough of WBLK.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.233
The only problem was it
was American, not Canadian.

30:00.276 --> 30:03.932
They didn't care about
our identity, our artists,

30:03.976 --> 30:07.066
you know, our movement.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.590
It was kind of a nice thing

30:09.633 --> 30:12.419
when a radio station came along.

30:12.462 --> 30:15.291
As tiny a signal as it had,
it didn't really matter,

30:15.335 --> 30:18.120
but for the first time
it created an umbrella

30:18.164 --> 30:20.731
for people to meet,
for people to connect.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.472
That was
my very first place

30:22.516 --> 30:24.953
where I had my interview,
I never-- and he said, like,

30:24.997 --> 30:28.478
"Yo, man, that's Melody MC,"
because that's my old rap name.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.873
"Melody MC, man,
he's 15 and damn, he's good."

30:31.917 --> 30:33.266
And I never forgot that.

30:33.309 --> 30:34.833
Up till now,
I still remember that.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.835
The real, true maestro,

30:36.878 --> 30:41.709
orchestrating everything
out of CKLN 88.1.

30:41.752 --> 30:44.059
I couldn't get enough
of that urban music.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.800
Didn't wait on distribution.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.236
Didn't wait on
the radio station.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.630
At the radio station,
you have a record library.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.632
It's a big room full of records.

30:51.675 --> 30:55.244
They had a few things
from Run DMC and Whodini,

30:55.288 --> 30:58.204
and a lot of the stuff was
really weird that I didn't like.

30:58.247 --> 31:01.337
If you wanted to
really please the people,

31:01.381 --> 31:03.383
you gotta go out
and get your own shit.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.907
And now, you can't
just go to a record store

31:05.951 --> 31:08.344
in Toronto and pick up
Rakim's record.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.737
They don't have it.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.391
They don't even know
what you're talking about.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.567
Those top-notch record
stores weren't thinking hip-hop.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.438
The music industry, period,
wasn't thinking hip-hop.

31:15.482 --> 31:16.831
They thought it was a fad.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.615
They thought, "Next year
this is gonna be gone."

31:18.659 --> 31:20.487
You'd have people
going to Buffalo

31:20.530 --> 31:22.924
because there were some
record distributors in Buffalo.

31:22.968 --> 31:25.187
You'd have people
travelling to New York City.

31:25.231 --> 31:28.016
The whole thing
about accessing music

31:28.060 --> 31:30.584
that we heard on
the radio in Canada

31:30.627 --> 31:33.021
was a whole
different level of difficulty

31:33.065 --> 31:35.589
than it was for
American record stores

31:35.632 --> 31:37.896
to get those same
pieces of vinyl.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.201
So we had to go through
a lot more trouble

31:39.245 --> 31:41.073
and wait a lot more as DJs,

31:41.116 --> 31:43.989
and travel a lot more
to find those record stores.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.425
How many records?

31:45.468 --> 31:49.777
I guess about 2,500 to 3,000.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.084
And when
you don't get records

31:52.127 --> 31:54.303
from the record company,
where do you go to get records?

31:54.347 --> 31:56.349
Usually Play De.

31:56.392 --> 31:59.830
They've got the best selection,
best hip-hop selection.

31:59.874 --> 32:03.182
The DJs in the store
were into hip-hop.

32:03.225 --> 32:06.272
They say, "This is good.
We should bring so-and-so."

32:06.315 --> 32:07.316
"Do it."

32:10.189 --> 32:13.018
That propelled him
to another level.

32:13.061 --> 32:16.151
Just word of mouth saying,
"Hey, Play De Record has this,

32:16.195 --> 32:18.327
"Play De Record has that."

32:18.371 --> 32:20.199
I remember
it being a place where

32:20.242 --> 32:21.852
I got all my records,

32:21.896 --> 32:25.769
not only for the radio show
but for clubs and DJ bookings.

32:25.813 --> 32:28.598
I mean, that was
the place where I went

32:28.642 --> 32:31.210
to get everything for the week.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.994
My mom
was never the type

32:33.038 --> 32:36.128
to give an allowance,
but she used to give me like

32:36.171 --> 32:39.000
$20 a week for me
to go and buy records

32:39.044 --> 32:40.654
because she knew how much
that I loved hip-hop.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.786
So I remember,
you know, grabbing

32:42.830 --> 32:46.007
The Beatnuts and Pharcyde
and, you know,

32:46.051 --> 32:48.662
all the other stuff
that was out at that time.

32:48.705 --> 32:51.186
Like, that was actually also
something that inspired us

32:51.230 --> 32:52.274
because we were like,

32:52.318 --> 32:54.233
yo, that's who
we wanted to be like.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.713
And bringing
the stuff that every, you know,

32:56.757 --> 33:01.109
popular DJ was playing,
I think really had that role

33:01.153 --> 33:05.853
in being able to shape Toronto's
scene and strengthen it,

33:05.896 --> 33:09.030
and actually
place us on the map.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.554
And that's
how the hip-hop

33:11.598 --> 33:13.687
and the electronic music

33:13.730 --> 33:16.298
were going together,
and it was all underground.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.822
It became expensive to
buy records because, you know,

33:18.866 --> 33:21.086
you're buying house and you're
buying hip-hop at the same time,

33:21.129 --> 33:23.653
but it was just so much of both.

33:23.697 --> 33:24.915
And everything was there.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.700
Like, you can get
everything there.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.354
So, as
a reggae selector,

33:28.397 --> 33:31.444
you'd just go to
the reggae record stores.

33:31.487 --> 33:32.575
You know what I mean?

33:32.619 --> 33:34.621
Try to get as much songs
as you can.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.753
But everybody's going there,
so you miss out.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.234
Now you miss out,
you don't have the songs,

33:39.278 --> 33:42.020
you need to mash up the place--
where is the record now?

33:42.063 --> 33:43.847
"Just go to
Play De Record, man!"

33:43.891 --> 33:44.935
"Why?"

33:44.979 --> 33:47.025
"Just go.
They have reggae, too."

33:47.068 --> 33:49.244
And you go there and,
there and behold, bro,

33:49.288 --> 33:51.290
there's a shop up, bro.
You know what I'm saying?

33:51.333 --> 33:52.552
It wasn't so much.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.206
You know, that two
little, small racks.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.077
It was maybe like that of 45s.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.339
You know what I mean?

33:57.383 --> 33:58.993
And a sprinkle of 12-inches
here and there.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.429
But... they were there!

34:00.473 --> 34:02.083
Know what I mean?

34:02.127 --> 34:04.607
It had really good music
that was well-curated,

34:04.651 --> 34:07.871
and people who knew about that
music and who could be like,

34:07.915 --> 34:10.222
"Oh, you're into this?
Check this out."

34:10.265 --> 34:11.614
That was
the difference between,

34:11.658 --> 34:14.704
you know, going to
just a regular record store

34:14.748 --> 34:16.837
and Play De Record.
And they had good stuff, right?

34:16.880 --> 34:19.144
They had local DJs
that knew what they're doing

34:19.187 --> 34:20.536
working there.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.799
One thing
I looked for is, like,

34:22.843 --> 34:27.282
young guys who's hungry,
who love music,

34:27.326 --> 34:32.070
and probably will do
anything for music.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.159
I went in
a couple of times,

34:34.202 --> 34:36.465
looked around
and saw what he had.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.554
I said,
"I would love to work here."

34:38.598 --> 34:42.080
And he said, "Yeah, sure."

34:42.123 --> 34:43.994
Then I went
over to Eugene's,

34:44.038 --> 34:46.606
I played a record and asked
him if I could do co-op.

34:46.649 --> 34:48.390
And at the time,
he was kind of like,

34:48.434 --> 34:50.000
"I don't need anyone else,"
you know?

34:50.044 --> 34:53.700
And I was like, "It's free,"
and he was like, "Okay!"

34:53.743 --> 34:56.485
For class, they actually
made us write out a proposal

34:56.529 --> 34:59.401
for why we should
be able to do it, you know,

34:59.445 --> 35:02.404
why we think we're suitable to
do co-op in your establishment.

35:02.448 --> 35:05.320
And I walked in there
with all this thing in my mind.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.843
I said, "Excuse me, sir,

35:06.887 --> 35:10.020
"can I please do my co-op
in your store?"

35:10.064 --> 35:12.675
And Eugene looked at me
and he said,

35:12.719 --> 35:14.851
"Okay."

35:14.895 --> 35:16.549
Some people,
they got their job there

35:16.592 --> 35:18.638
because they were big, top DJs.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.292
People would come
follow them at parties

35:20.335 --> 35:22.120
and come buy records off them.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.601
Other people ended up coming
as, like, co-op students,

35:25.645 --> 35:30.693
and I just came
out of being a customer.

35:30.737 --> 35:32.521
They said,
"Hey, why don't you come by?

35:32.565 --> 35:34.393
"And, you know,
Eugene wants to talk to you."

35:34.436 --> 35:37.135
And so Eugene talked to me
and said, "Hey, you know,

35:37.178 --> 35:40.007
"it would be nice if you could,
you know, work here."

35:43.402 --> 35:45.795
They all shop here,
all the top DJs,

35:45.839 --> 35:48.320
like Chris Sheppard, Hedley,

35:48.363 --> 35:50.235
Wayne Williams, Mike Devine,

35:50.278 --> 35:54.152
Dr. Know, Paul Lopez, DJX.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.718
So, initially
when I started working at

35:55.762 --> 35:57.546
Play De Record, I had an in

35:57.590 --> 35:59.287
to getting what was
gonna be a hit

35:59.331 --> 36:01.246
way before it
even got to the store.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.944
And then a lot of times,
I knew a lot of producers

36:03.987 --> 36:07.077
that would give me their
songs on DAT, like a master,

36:07.121 --> 36:09.341
and they would send it to me
and they'd say, "Here, play it."

36:09.384 --> 36:10.559
It was in their best interest,

36:10.603 --> 36:12.561
so if they were
to give it to me,

36:12.605 --> 36:14.911
I would break it on radio,
to the clubs,

36:14.955 --> 36:16.783
so that when
the record came out,

36:16.826 --> 36:19.916
it would sell out
within seconds.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.179
Record bitch!

36:21.222 --> 36:22.702
That was my original position.

36:22.745 --> 36:26.009
Put away vinyl,
label vinyl, price vinyl.

36:26.053 --> 36:28.838
Write those little stupid signs
that you guys used to steal,

36:28.882 --> 36:32.755
just rip off and throw it--
that was my job, originally.

36:32.799 --> 36:37.020
I began to see some
of the best DJs in the city,

36:37.064 --> 36:39.458
how they were
shopping for vinyl,

36:39.501 --> 36:41.764
how they were
listening to vinyl,

36:41.808 --> 36:45.246
what was making them
buy a piece of vinyl,

36:45.290 --> 36:48.336
and I started to really become
a student of the game

36:48.380 --> 36:51.383
and watch--
I mean, this is Toronto.

36:51.426 --> 36:54.342
We have a million
great DJs here.

36:54.386 --> 36:59.652
Dave Cooper, Jason Palma,
Medicine Muffin, everybody,

36:59.695 --> 37:02.263
and these are the people
that were just on staff alone.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.743
Kenny Glasgow.

37:03.786 --> 37:06.267
Like, people were there,
like the best of the best.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.313
By that time,
I had been coming to Play De

37:08.356 --> 37:10.924
for a few years and I had become
really friendly with Eugene,

37:10.967 --> 37:14.232
and Peter and Tyrone and Aki,
and I was starting to DJ

37:14.275 --> 37:17.278
and I was starting to make my
name in the underground scene.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.498
Aki went to bat for me and said,
"You should get Jason.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.064
"He's pretty knowledgeable."

37:21.108 --> 37:22.501
So then Eugene
asked me and he goes,

37:22.544 --> 37:23.589
"We'll try you out.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.330
"We'll try you out.
A couple days."

37:25.373 --> 37:26.635
A couple days
turned into...?

37:26.679 --> 37:28.594
Twenty-something years,
I guess, right?

37:28.637 --> 37:30.422
Or longer.
Yeah, it's a long time!

37:30.465 --> 37:32.424
Twenty-something years, yeah.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.168
And I've told him this,

37:38.212 --> 37:40.606
and I've told lots of people
this, that I think

37:40.649 --> 37:42.390
he has the best ears in
the city, even back then.

37:42.434 --> 37:43.522
He knows
his stuff, man.

37:43.565 --> 37:44.914
Like, that guy knows records.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.873
He pulled stuff that
was just like, he goes,

37:46.916 --> 37:48.483
"Oh, just take this.
You're gonna like it."

37:48.527 --> 37:49.702
I said, "Okay," and then you
got home and you're just like,

37:49.745 --> 37:51.617
"Shit, this is like,
yeah, crazy."

37:51.660 --> 37:53.619
I mean, his taste
in music was also, like,

37:53.662 --> 37:55.447
"Don't even listen to it,
just buy it."

37:55.490 --> 37:57.927
That guy
studies music every night.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.668
He knows what's going on.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.322
He DJs.

38:01.366 --> 38:06.458
He really brought a lot to
the table, and he's a good DJ.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.764
And Eugene was smart.

38:08.808 --> 38:11.201
He loved music
but he didn't know everything.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.203
He couldn't know everything.
Nobody can know everything.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.467
But he wanted to get
the people in there

38:15.510 --> 38:17.817
that he knew
other people respected.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.384
So when
he hired Aki,

38:19.427 --> 38:22.082
he knew Aki knew the young
kids that wanted house.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.910
When he hired Peter and Tyrone,
he knew that.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.955
When he hired Junior,
he knew Junior knew the kids

38:25.999 --> 38:27.479
who wanted hip-hop records.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.219
And then, he saw that I knew
what I was talking about,

38:29.263 --> 38:32.135
he saw that I had a knack
for showing kids records

38:32.179 --> 38:33.702
and selling records.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.617
Because Eugene had a thing...

38:35.661 --> 38:37.227
He's like, "Okay,
you gotta push records.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.490
"Push 'em!"

38:38.533 --> 38:40.056
Because he wanted to
sell records, right?

38:40.100 --> 38:42.232
Like, Eugene loved the records,
but he loved the business.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.669
You know,
he was trying to make money.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.497
I was pushing--
"Hey, we gotta sell.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.761
"We got 100 of this record
and you're not selling, man!

38:48.804 --> 38:50.980
"I can't pay you guys, man!

38:51.024 --> 38:53.418
"Let's sell, man!"
And then they would go.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.376
Back then, the culture
was a little bit different.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.944
One record could literally
make a difference

38:57.987 --> 39:00.338
in your entire night as a DJ.

39:00.381 --> 39:04.254
That's what my job was, is to
find out what that record is.

39:04.298 --> 39:06.561
Then you have to
listen to somebody play the song

39:06.605 --> 39:08.781
on their phone,
and you'd hear, you know,

39:08.824 --> 39:11.392
just by listening to it,
whether it's good or not, right?

39:11.436 --> 39:12.872
And that's how you'd order.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.874
You know,
on top of ordering,

39:14.917 --> 39:16.745
you'd have to order smart
because, you know,

39:16.789 --> 39:19.269
if I was saying, "We're
gonna move 30 of that,"

39:19.313 --> 39:20.793
and it just sat in the shop,

39:20.836 --> 39:22.403
well, then he's not gonna
trust you anymore.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.709
You had to guess.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.319
"You know what?
I can move 10 of that.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.973
"I can move 20 of that."

39:27.016 --> 39:29.105
The people that worked
in the store didn't just, like,

39:29.149 --> 39:31.586
"I focus on this
and anything else is like,

39:31.630 --> 39:33.109
"If I like it,
I'll know about it.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.937
"If I don't,
I don't care about it."

39:34.981 --> 39:37.331
Regardless of what
your speciality was,

39:37.375 --> 39:39.289
you had to know music.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.337
But all of us
working together,

39:43.381 --> 39:45.731
especially these guys,
you know, the young,

39:45.774 --> 39:49.909
the youth and them,
they were pushing me, man.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.258
And I was going for it, too,

39:51.301 --> 39:52.825
because I wanted
to succeed, right?

39:52.868 --> 39:54.609
Call it the
Play De Record alumni.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.003
Like, honestly, now,
looking back on it,

39:57.046 --> 39:59.875
so many amazing, talented people

39:59.919 --> 40:03.096
came out of that school,
in a sense.

40:03.139 --> 40:05.315
You know,
the knowledge that I gained

40:05.359 --> 40:08.144
from working there,
that was my pay, you know?

40:08.188 --> 40:13.280
I mean, Eugene, I owe it all
to Eugene, what I have now,

40:13.323 --> 40:16.239
you know,
as I learned everything

40:16.283 --> 40:19.025
about the record store business
and selling records from him.

40:19.068 --> 40:22.376
So, you know, that was my pay.

40:34.388 --> 40:35.998
There was also, though,

40:36.042 --> 40:39.306
a whole movement
going on in the urban areas,

40:39.349 --> 40:41.526
like in Scarborough,
where we had Mike's Music Shop,

40:41.569 --> 40:45.791
and in Eglinton West, we had,
like, Monica's Records and,

40:45.834 --> 40:49.925
you know, a few others
that pioneered the idea

40:49.969 --> 40:52.232
of you sell more records

40:52.275 --> 40:55.104
if you have a good sound system
in the record store.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.932
It's like you're seeing a DJ.

40:56.976 --> 40:59.674
Play De Record
had a similar concept

40:59.718 --> 41:01.415
where I would be
playing the records

41:01.459 --> 41:03.417
and the DJs would be
there and say,

41:03.461 --> 41:06.812
"Yeah, that's pretty good."
I had to really know the song,

41:06.855 --> 41:08.857
the breaks,
the best part of the song,

41:08.901 --> 41:11.425
so that I can sell
that music to them, right?

41:21.740 --> 41:23.393
You can hear it
before you see it.

41:23.437 --> 41:25.308
You know, that was the beauty
about Play De Record.

41:25.352 --> 41:27.702
You know, you can hear it
from the street

41:27.746 --> 41:29.704
and you don't really know
where the music is coming from.

41:29.748 --> 41:32.968
Whoever was available
and could handle the heat

41:33.012 --> 41:36.711
would be behind the turntables
at the deck and be like, boom,

41:36.755 --> 41:40.541
album cut, boom, 12-inch,
remix of a big song.

41:43.457 --> 41:44.545
They played loud,

41:44.589 --> 41:47.330
and when you play it loud...

41:47.374 --> 41:48.549
it sounds better!

41:48.593 --> 41:50.290
Right?

41:50.333 --> 41:52.771
Because I know so many customers
always tell me the same thing.

41:52.814 --> 41:54.599
They say, "Man, this store
played some songs

41:54.642 --> 41:57.297
"and it was so good, man,
but when I got home,

41:57.340 --> 41:58.516
"the songs sound like shit."

41:59.908 --> 42:01.780
But I don't know.
You know what I mean?

42:03.259 --> 42:04.957
This is a place
where everybody can come

42:05.000 --> 42:07.612
and have an opportunity
to listen to new beats.

42:23.018 --> 42:24.846
Well, Star Sound
was there at the time,

42:24.890 --> 42:26.587
and Carnival Records, right?

42:26.631 --> 42:29.068
So they were my
competition at that time.

42:29.111 --> 42:31.723
And then,
I think Carnival closed,

42:31.766 --> 42:34.377
and then Star Sound started...

42:34.421 --> 42:37.250
I don't know what happened,
you know?

42:37.293 --> 42:39.687
And then they switched to--

42:39.731 --> 42:42.168
George took it over
and became Traxx.

42:42.211 --> 42:43.822
There was Play De Record
and Star Sound,

42:43.865 --> 42:46.041
which later became us.

42:46.085 --> 42:49.001
I never worked in Star Sound,
but and I would just, you know,

42:49.044 --> 42:51.046
like every kid, you go hop, hop,
but I only had, really,

42:51.090 --> 42:52.613
I was going downtown.

42:52.657 --> 42:56.095
Going downtown in itself
was an adventure, number one,

42:56.138 --> 42:57.662
because I was never downtown.

42:57.705 --> 43:01.230
And I would just literally
go Carnival, Play De Record,

43:01.274 --> 43:03.624
Star Sound, just bang bang
bang bang bang.

43:03.668 --> 43:05.539
And you're going into this
record store that, like,

43:05.583 --> 43:07.802
all these big dog DJs are there,
and you're like,

43:07.846 --> 43:09.282
"Oh, whoa.
Whoa!

43:09.325 --> 43:11.197
That's-- oh, wow, okay,
this is what they do!"

43:11.240 --> 43:13.112
And then you look
at the price tag

43:13.155 --> 43:15.201
and you're like, "Okay, $7,"
and I'm like,

43:15.244 --> 43:17.986
"Ah, I need money to get home,
I need to eat something...

43:18.030 --> 43:19.727
"Okay, I can
take away the eating.

43:19.771 --> 43:21.424
"But I gotta get home still!"

43:21.468 --> 43:23.688
And Play De
just became my normal

43:23.731 --> 43:27.561
because that's where
all my age friends were going,

43:27.605 --> 43:29.215
because they were cool.

43:29.258 --> 43:30.477
You know, it was family-owned.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.174
Big difference.

43:32.218 --> 43:34.263
Even though Eugene's dad
looked like he wants to

43:34.307 --> 43:36.309
kill everybody in the store
when you walk in,

43:36.352 --> 43:38.354
when you get to know them,
super cool.

43:38.398 --> 43:40.095
You know what I mean?
The mom is super cool.

43:40.139 --> 43:41.575
Eugene and Donna, amazing.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.012
But my relationship with Traxx
was because of George,

43:44.056 --> 43:46.667
who owned Traxx, was part-owner
of Traxx and Shakedown,

43:46.711 --> 43:50.279
because I'd been using Shakedown
for so long at that point,

43:50.323 --> 43:52.455
and I was very close
with George.

43:52.499 --> 43:54.501
He owned
a rental company,

43:54.544 --> 43:56.677
Shakedown Sound,

43:56.721 --> 44:00.202
so a lot of people used to rent
off him for all sorts of stuff,

44:00.246 --> 44:02.988
whether it was
turntables, mixers,

44:03.031 --> 44:05.730
and he also used to DJ himself.

44:05.773 --> 44:08.733
So anyway,
I've known him for a long time.

44:08.776 --> 44:10.560
On
the right-hand side of me

44:10.604 --> 44:12.693
is the legend, the owner
of Traxx Records, George.

44:12.737 --> 44:13.955
What's going on?

44:13.999 --> 44:15.740
What influenced you
to open up the shop?

44:15.783 --> 44:18.699
Oh, well,
we got an opportunity to mix

44:18.743 --> 44:21.136
DJ equipment sales
and records together,

44:21.180 --> 44:23.791
and we all know every
DJ needs equipment,

44:23.835 --> 44:27.186
so I guess we, combined
with me and Ahmed over there,

44:27.229 --> 44:31.277
to open a store that, you know,
we could have equipment,

44:31.320 --> 44:34.149
where they can do all
their buying in one place.

44:34.193 --> 44:37.413
Yeah, so the difference
between George and Eugene,

44:37.457 --> 44:41.200
I think Eugene was
kind of like your uncle

44:41.243 --> 44:43.289
or like your older brother.

44:43.332 --> 44:45.944
George is very, like,
he's very business-oriented.

44:45.987 --> 44:49.121
Both great guys,
but both very, very different.

44:49.164 --> 44:50.905
Biggest heart in the world.

44:50.949 --> 44:54.692
Would do anything for you
when you're on his side.

44:54.735 --> 44:57.085
But also the guy that
if he doesn't like what you do

44:57.129 --> 44:58.913
will tell you you're an idiot,
you're an asshole.

44:58.957 --> 45:02.351
"What the fuck are you doing?
Get the fuck out of my store."

45:02.395 --> 45:03.831
But by the same token,
he's that guy,

45:03.875 --> 45:05.746
if he loves you,
he'll give you the biggest hug

45:05.790 --> 45:07.487
in the world and make sure
you get that record.

45:07.530 --> 45:08.793
So put that into a big ball

45:08.836 --> 45:10.969
and roll it down
the bowling alley,

45:11.012 --> 45:12.797
and that's George.

45:15.147 --> 45:16.757
Star Sound
was the only one around.

45:16.801 --> 45:18.541
He should have never
let Eugene come on board.

45:18.585 --> 45:19.891
Honestly.

45:19.934 --> 45:21.240
Like, I mean,
it's just like any competition:

45:21.283 --> 45:23.459
if you can bury them, bury them.

45:23.503 --> 45:25.331
Star Sound
was having a hard time,

45:25.374 --> 45:27.202
and he kind of
convinced Star Sound

45:27.246 --> 45:30.684
to sell them Star Sound.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.773
He asked me if I was
interested to get involved

45:32.817 --> 45:34.601
with him in this record store
and I thought, you know,

45:34.644 --> 45:39.911
"Hand in hand, DJs, records,
audio: perfect mix."

45:43.436 --> 45:47.005
<i>♪ Such a treat,
such a treat... ♪</i>

45:47.048 --> 45:49.921
<i>♪ Such a treat, such a treat!</i>

45:51.531 --> 45:53.359
<i>DJs,
get on the right track</i>

45:53.402 --> 45:55.056
<i>with Traxx!</i>

45:55.100 --> 45:59.147
<i>Traxx, Canada's largest dance
music and DJ equipment emporium.</i>

46:01.497 --> 46:04.457
Well, we took
Peter and Tyrone from Play De,

46:04.500 --> 46:06.764
so that was a big thing
for us at the beginning.

46:06.807 --> 46:08.200
Getting Peter
and Tyrone was big.

46:08.243 --> 46:09.679
Overnight it happened.

46:09.723 --> 46:11.290
We tell Eugene, you know,
"We're going over.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.726
"We're leaving.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.684
"We gotta go to the store,
Traxx, and we're going."

46:14.728 --> 46:17.078
Obviously Eugene was sad.

46:17.122 --> 46:20.734
When George came out,
he took Peter

46:20.778 --> 46:22.518
to his store,
so, cool, alright.

46:22.562 --> 46:24.216
You know, and it was
nothing against Eugene

46:24.259 --> 46:25.434
or anything.

46:25.478 --> 46:27.175
I just needed to change.

46:27.219 --> 46:29.525
But they were gonna
basically run my store, right?

46:29.569 --> 46:31.614
So they were gonna be
like management.

46:31.658 --> 46:34.182
So they had control
of what they ordered,

46:34.226 --> 46:35.793
and I think they liked that.

46:35.836 --> 46:37.446
And this is
where the politics

46:37.490 --> 46:40.406
of the record stores
got very interesting.

46:40.449 --> 46:42.974
You had Shams
down at Play De Record,

46:43.017 --> 46:45.324
and then you had Peter
and Tyrone up the street

46:45.367 --> 46:47.195
doing the ordering at Traxx.

46:47.239 --> 46:50.416
The three of them happened to be
these incredible DJs

46:50.459 --> 46:53.462
that had a DJ crew
called Peter, Tyrone & Shams.

46:53.506 --> 46:56.291
If they wanted,
they could theoretically

46:56.335 --> 46:59.077
bring in enough records
for each of them

46:59.120 --> 47:02.515
to have a copy and no one else
in the city to have a copy.

47:02.558 --> 47:06.693
This became a very
frustrating situation for me,

47:06.736 --> 47:10.262
though Eugene would,
in many cases,

47:10.305 --> 47:12.177
put his foot down to make
sure that I was getting

47:12.220 --> 47:13.613
what I wanted.

47:13.656 --> 47:15.136
I wasn't a DJ.

47:15.180 --> 47:18.487
I wanted to get
the music out there.

47:18.531 --> 47:20.881
I played no politics in it,
you know?

47:20.925 --> 47:24.493
If I get a few records, I will
hold it for maybe Chris Sheppard

47:24.537 --> 47:27.148
and Hedley for their
radio shows, you know?

47:27.192 --> 47:29.716
Because if those guys play it,

47:29.759 --> 47:31.631
people like it;
I'm gonna sell more.

47:31.674 --> 47:33.589
It's
Chris Sheppard on your radio,

47:33.633 --> 47:35.591
feeling alright!

47:35.635 --> 47:37.506
They have to be
taken care of first.

47:37.550 --> 47:40.118
It would make no sense for 15
copies of an exclusive record

47:40.161 --> 47:43.164
to come in and you're giving it
to the "basement DJs,"

47:43.208 --> 47:45.906
and then the record just sits
and dies till the next week;

47:45.950 --> 47:47.777
you gotta wait another week
till it comes in, right?

47:47.821 --> 47:50.128
So, we had to
take care of the big dogs.

47:50.171 --> 47:51.477
It's part of it.

47:51.520 --> 47:52.695
That's the game.

47:52.739 --> 47:54.045
But I don't know.

47:54.088 --> 47:57.439
When I think back,
if you had the record only,

47:57.483 --> 47:59.964
you're probably,
you know, the king, right?

48:00.007 --> 48:01.879
You get to keep
everything because you need

48:01.922 --> 48:03.402
to see what to reorder.

48:03.445 --> 48:06.796
You would only order one,
to sample it,

48:06.840 --> 48:10.017
to see if you need to
reorder some of them

48:10.061 --> 48:11.453
for the following week.

48:11.497 --> 48:12.715
They were saying,

48:12.759 --> 48:13.803
"Oh, we didn't know
if the record was good."

48:13.847 --> 48:15.066
But they knew
the record was good.

48:15.109 --> 48:16.328
They just didn't want
anybody to have it.

48:16.371 --> 48:18.069
They wanted to be
the first guys to play it.

48:18.112 --> 48:19.505
You know, we had little
arguments here and there

48:19.548 --> 48:21.594
with the staff with that shit.

48:21.637 --> 48:23.726
Peter and Tyrone
left and Traxx opened.

48:23.770 --> 48:26.512
Traxx was Star Sound,
turned into Traxx.

48:26.555 --> 48:28.427
George bought it,
and then there was a price war.

48:28.470 --> 48:30.690
He was a tough guy, too.
He was...

48:30.733 --> 48:32.997
He was very competitive also.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.781
We went down
a little bit in price

48:34.824 --> 48:37.523
because we're behind
a store, man!

48:37.566 --> 48:39.960
Who's gonna find us?

48:40.004 --> 48:41.875
I guess
if you own the building,

48:41.919 --> 48:44.965
like he supposedly did, that's
just I don't know for facts,

48:45.009 --> 48:46.532
but you can get away with that.

48:46.575 --> 48:48.969
But if you're giving 15% off,
then a dollar off,

48:49.013 --> 48:50.884
after a while
all that shit adds up.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.973
You're only making,
like, 2 bucks a record.

48:53.017 --> 48:55.106
Not only were
the records $6.79,

48:55.149 --> 48:56.672
but everybody wanted a discount.

48:56.716 --> 48:58.109
Everybody thought
they should get a discount.

48:58.152 --> 48:59.937
And it goes to the point
where Eugene is like,

48:59.980 --> 49:02.504
"I can't because
it's already $6.50 or $6.79."

49:02.548 --> 49:03.679
Like, it was crazy.

49:03.723 --> 49:05.420
There was loyal customers
to both shops,

49:05.464 --> 49:06.856
but at the end of the day,

49:06.900 --> 49:09.729
everybody just wanted
the damn records.

49:09.772 --> 49:13.515
Play De Record and Traxx
were very much neck-and-neck.

49:13.559 --> 49:15.082
Keep in mind,
you're talking about, you know,

49:15.126 --> 49:17.824
a Starbucks being
right next to a Tim Hortons.

49:17.867 --> 49:19.869
They were literal walking
distance from each other,

49:19.913 --> 49:22.002
on the same street,
on the same side of the street.

49:22.046 --> 49:24.178
DJ Power: They were right
up the street so, I mean,

49:24.222 --> 49:26.180
you'd go to one,
then you'd go to the other.

49:26.224 --> 49:27.399
I would
go to Traxx first.

49:27.442 --> 49:29.009
That was my first stop.

49:29.053 --> 49:31.055
I would make the
trek up the street as well, too.

49:31.098 --> 49:32.839
So, you know,
you'd go to different places,

49:32.882 --> 49:34.928
but Play De was definitely
a staple for me

49:34.972 --> 49:36.538
as far as the records
that I buy.

49:36.582 --> 49:39.019
There's plenty of
red and white bags

49:39.063 --> 49:41.021
around my parents' house
still to this day!

49:41.065 --> 49:42.849
Eugene is
obviously closer to, like,

49:42.892 --> 49:45.112
the actual where I would
get off on the subway.

49:45.156 --> 49:46.374
Exactly.

49:46.418 --> 49:48.115
So I would
go to Play De first

49:48.159 --> 49:49.987
and then walk up to Traxx.
Mm-hm.

49:50.030 --> 49:52.946
So it was always
like something snarky to say,

49:52.990 --> 49:54.469
you know?
Yeah, yeah.

49:54.513 --> 49:56.080
You know, a grudge
in the belly, you know?

49:56.123 --> 49:57.168
"You don't know about me!"

49:57.211 --> 49:58.734
Yeah, yeah,
straight up.

49:58.778 --> 50:01.128
"Back in my
gino days," and all this stuff.

50:01.172 --> 50:03.652
So you're like, "Okay,
whatever, dude."

50:03.696 --> 50:05.524
But I like George.
Shoutout to George.

50:05.567 --> 50:06.960
Respect to
George and Ahmed

50:07.004 --> 50:08.527
for opening up Traxx.

50:08.570 --> 50:10.616
Another thing is they have
a wide selection of DJ tapes.

50:10.659 --> 50:13.010
Included in there is my tape,
Tricky Moreira,

50:13.053 --> 50:16.535
and it's a Dance Nation version.
Pick it up at Traxx Records.

50:16.578 --> 50:20.321
So, Play De is
obviously known for records,

50:20.365 --> 50:22.584
and for 12-inch singles, etc.

50:22.628 --> 50:25.239
Funk, house, hip-hop.

50:25.283 --> 50:28.242
But what people might not know
about Play De Record

50:28.286 --> 50:29.635
was the mixtape era.

50:35.597 --> 50:38.513
That was
a huge part of our revenue.

50:38.557 --> 50:40.602
After you get past
the porn and everything,

50:40.646 --> 50:43.953
the first thing you see
is the mixtape wall.

50:43.997 --> 50:46.782
Those mixtapes were, like,
the first time you heard stuff,

50:46.826 --> 50:50.090
heard music, heard verses,
heard of artists.

50:50.134 --> 50:51.657
They'd be
a calling card.

50:51.700 --> 50:54.616
DJs would create mixtapes to
showcase the kind of sounds

50:54.660 --> 50:56.531
they'd play and how
they mixed them.

50:56.575 --> 51:01.536
I would buy Jason Palma
cassettes, JoJo Flores.

51:01.580 --> 51:04.757
I would buy drum and bass CDs
and mixtapes from there.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.454
Like, I had
Neil Armstrong from New York.

51:06.498 --> 51:08.456
He was like, "I need to
go to Play De Record,"

51:08.500 --> 51:10.284
because he needed to break off
Eugene with some mixtapes.

51:10.328 --> 51:12.286
If you don't have your mixtapes
at Play De,

51:12.330 --> 51:14.114
you're not hitting
your target audience.

51:14.158 --> 51:15.420
I did a mixtape
and he goes,

51:15.463 --> 51:16.638
"How many copies do you have?"

51:16.682 --> 51:18.684
I said, "Oh, I got,
I dunno, 30 copies."

51:18.727 --> 51:20.860
"Okay, give me all 30."
"Oh!" I said, "Okay!"

51:20.903 --> 51:23.428
So it was like-- and I know
some of the hip-hop guys,

51:23.471 --> 51:25.430
they were just, like,
selling out the door.

51:25.473 --> 51:28.433
I lent one of my tapes
to a buddy at school

51:28.476 --> 51:30.913
and he really liked it, and he's
like, "Can you make me a tape?"

51:30.957 --> 51:33.133
"I've got way too much homework.
I've got too much going on.

51:33.177 --> 51:34.787
"That's not happening."
He used to cut hair,

51:34.830 --> 51:37.006
so he always had money,
and he's like, "I'll pay you."

51:37.050 --> 51:38.965
"Pay me?" He's like,
"Yeah, I'll give you 10 bucks."

51:39.008 --> 51:41.185
Ten bucks?
That's a new 12-inch!

51:41.228 --> 51:44.144
So, a 12-inch and lunch!

51:44.188 --> 51:47.278
You know, he loved it,
and then his friends copied it

51:47.321 --> 51:49.410
and it went around the school.
This was in high school.

51:49.454 --> 51:51.978
And you know, before I know it,
I'm doing Sweet Sixteens

51:52.021 --> 51:54.415
and high school dances,
and I kind of just

51:54.459 --> 51:56.374
stumbled into it as a fan.

51:56.417 --> 51:59.028
I have all this vinyl,
I want to make a mixtape.

51:59.072 --> 52:02.423
So, I started trying to
make mixtapes

52:02.467 --> 52:05.644
for just my friends and myself.

52:05.687 --> 52:07.080
It's like,
"Yo, listen to my tape!

52:07.124 --> 52:09.169
"Listen to my demo!
Please listen to my demo."

52:09.213 --> 52:11.432
You know what I mean?
Got feedback from people.

52:11.476 --> 52:13.173
The girls liked the R&B.

52:13.217 --> 52:14.827
"Oh, do you have this song?
Do you have this song?"

52:14.870 --> 52:17.308
One tape turned
into a whole empire,

52:17.351 --> 52:19.397
but that's more for the story.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.877
<i>When I say "baby,"
y'all say "blue!"</i>

52:21.921 --> 52:25.577
And I did it on
a Victoria Day long weekend.

52:25.620 --> 52:28.493
That was the weekend that
you wanted to get mixtapes

52:28.536 --> 52:31.670
in people's hands because
it was like the official start

52:31.713 --> 52:34.455
to the summer,
and this is probably

52:34.499 --> 52:36.109
what you're gonna bump.

52:36.153 --> 52:39.460
If you like the mixtape and
you got it on May 24 weekend,

52:39.504 --> 52:41.680
it was gonna bump all summer.

52:41.723 --> 52:44.596
I used to distribute to friends,
and then I began,

52:44.639 --> 52:45.988
like, selling them.

52:46.032 --> 52:49.775
I knew that, okay,
I needed to get into the spot

52:49.818 --> 52:51.603
where the big DJs
had their tapes.

52:51.646 --> 52:54.040
A couple of DJs came in
and approached me and said,

52:54.083 --> 52:56.347
"Hey, can we sell
some mixtapes?"

52:56.390 --> 52:58.523
And I was like,
"Okay, sure, why not?

52:58.566 --> 53:02.831
"It will help boost sales
for the mixtapes

53:02.875 --> 53:06.966
"and also pay for
the high property taxes."

53:07.009 --> 53:09.969
And one of those DJs' names
was Mastermind.

53:10.012 --> 53:12.363
At the time,
there is a group of DJs

53:12.406 --> 53:14.278
who are already taste-makers
in the city.

53:14.321 --> 53:15.844
Mastermind is one of them.

53:15.888 --> 53:18.020
DJX is the other one.

53:18.064 --> 53:20.588
And if you're an aspiring DJ,

53:20.632 --> 53:23.504
you want to be
one of these two guys.

53:25.332 --> 53:28.248
When it
came to hip-hop,

53:28.292 --> 53:29.684
there is no competition.

53:29.728 --> 53:32.818
When it came to hip-hop,
there was Mastermind.

53:32.861 --> 53:36.648
<i>♪ 21 years of my life--
21 years of my lifetime... ♪</i>

53:36.691 --> 53:38.345
You know what I mean?

53:38.389 --> 53:43.307
Mastermind laid the pavement
down when it came to hip-hop.

53:43.350 --> 53:44.917
<i>♪ Choclair's in the house.</i>

53:44.960 --> 53:47.615
<i>♪ 21 years of my lifetime.</i>

53:47.659 --> 53:49.878

53:49.922 --> 53:53.055

54:13.685 --> 54:15.817
There you go.

54:15.861 --> 54:16.992
The man.

54:17.036 --> 54:18.994
That's the man.

54:19.038 --> 54:21.170
I was introduced to
hip-hop through breakdancing.

54:21.214 --> 54:23.521
Saw it downtown at the
Eaton's Centre at a young age.

54:23.564 --> 54:26.306
I heard somebody
blasting hip-hop,

54:26.350 --> 54:27.829
breakdance music
at the time I guess

54:27.873 --> 54:29.440
is what it was known for,

54:29.483 --> 54:33.052
on his radio, and I was like,
"Yo, where do you get this?

54:33.095 --> 54:34.140
"Where do you find this?"

54:34.183 --> 54:36.838
And he told me
about a radio show.

54:36.882 --> 54:39.754
Saturday afternoons,
1 to 4, on 88.1.

54:39.798 --> 54:41.930
Mastermind was
just a young kid.

54:41.974 --> 54:43.671
He used to call
into the radio show,

54:43.715 --> 54:46.326
and I liked this guy because
he was able to name songs.

54:46.370 --> 54:48.110
Whenever I quizzed people,

54:48.154 --> 54:50.461
he would be that guy that would
get all the names of the songs.

54:50.504 --> 54:51.810
Eventually we developed
a friendship.

54:51.853 --> 54:53.464
I was always
making tapes for people,

54:53.507 --> 54:54.900
who'd always say,
"Hey, make me a tape.

54:54.943 --> 54:56.510
"Make me a tape"; so my
girlfriend would get a tape.

54:56.554 --> 54:58.033
Some of my best friends
would get tapes,

54:58.077 --> 54:59.905
or they would get dubs of
the tapes that I would make.

54:59.948 --> 55:01.776
Too Black Guys clothing store,
they were probably

55:01.820 --> 55:04.562
the first place that I ever
put any tapes for sale.

55:04.605 --> 55:08.392
They're selling out so quick
at Too Black Guys,

55:08.435 --> 55:10.524
there's other places
I can start selling them.

55:10.568 --> 55:12.265
You know,
there's barbershops, there's--

55:12.309 --> 55:14.093
and then, there's a couple
of record stores,

55:14.136 --> 55:16.443
Play De Record and Traxx.

55:16.487 --> 55:19.141
I went and saw Eugene
one fateful day,

55:19.185 --> 55:21.318
and it kind of blew up
from there.

55:21.361 --> 55:24.103
He came to our store
and he liked what we were doing,

55:24.146 --> 55:27.193
and became friends,
and he kind of hooked me up

55:27.236 --> 55:29.151
with some guys in New York.

55:29.195 --> 55:32.024
You know, those guys kept me
abreast with some of the music.

55:32.067 --> 55:34.418
He literally
was like, "Yo, sold out.

55:34.461 --> 55:36.028
"Yo, I need more, I need more."

55:36.071 --> 55:37.899
And the one advantage
that I had,

55:37.943 --> 55:40.728
and I think that might
have been above and beyond

55:40.772 --> 55:43.122
all the other guys,
is I had a radio show.

55:43.165 --> 55:45.559
<i>The Mastermind Street Jam.</i>

55:45.603 --> 55:47.518
<i>Str-Street Jam!</i>

55:47.561 --> 55:50.956
And so I used
my radio show to promote

55:50.999 --> 55:53.654
that I had tapes and where
they were being sold.

55:53.698 --> 55:57.092
They just started to fly
out of Eugene's store.

55:57.136 --> 56:01.401
And so, even in hindsight,
the majority, like the most,

56:01.445 --> 56:05.013
were being sold out
of Play De Record.

56:05.057 --> 56:06.580
We continue
with the freestyles.

56:06.624 --> 56:09.409
This is part of the
Let's Make a Record Deal series

56:09.453 --> 56:12.151
that's on the album representing
Scar Town, Scar City,

56:12.194 --> 56:14.240
Citizen Kane, y'all.

56:28.559 --> 56:32.389
At that point,
Play De was also a ticket spot.

56:32.432 --> 56:36.871
Any type of event or party
that was happening in the city,

56:36.915 --> 56:38.482
"Tickets available at..."

56:38.525 --> 56:40.440
The first place
they would say on any roll,

56:40.484 --> 56:42.181
any commercial you heard,
the first name you'd always hear

56:42.224 --> 56:43.443
is "Play De Record."

56:43.487 --> 56:45.619
It was central.
Everybody knew where it was.

56:45.663 --> 56:47.969
It didn't matter
if I was doing a reggae show

56:48.013 --> 56:51.320
or if I was doing a hip-hop show
or if I was just doing a dance,

56:51.364 --> 56:53.845
if I sold tickets and I put them
on sale with Eugene,

56:53.888 --> 56:56.500
I would have to go back
to restock that store.

56:56.543 --> 56:58.893
It wasn't uncommon
for me to take tickets

56:58.937 --> 57:00.765
from other stores
and give them to Eugene.

57:00.808 --> 57:03.855
You know, I'm call Shanti Baba
on Queen Street,

57:03.898 --> 57:05.465
"How many tickets do you
have left for Erykah Badu?"

57:05.509 --> 57:06.945
"40, but don't--
people are coming!

57:06.988 --> 57:08.207
"People are calling, dude!"

57:08.250 --> 57:10.557
And I'm like,
"I need, like, 30 of them."

57:10.601 --> 57:12.472
He's like, "Let me guess,
you're giving them to Eugene?"

57:12.516 --> 57:13.604
I'm like, "Yeah."

57:13.647 --> 57:15.257
Eugene didn't
just make money

57:15.301 --> 57:17.129
and make a business
out of selling records.

57:17.172 --> 57:19.784
That's a good part of it,
but the other big part of it

57:19.827 --> 57:21.655
is selling tickets to parties.

57:21.699 --> 57:25.529
You have, like, 20, 30,
maybe even 50 promoters

57:25.572 --> 57:28.619
that were doing parties
all the way from Hamilton

57:28.662 --> 57:31.839
to Pickering, to Ajax,
to even Whitby, doing parties.

57:31.883 --> 57:34.538
They're bringing everybody
into this space,

57:34.581 --> 57:36.714
and from that space
they're buying records.

57:36.757 --> 57:37.976
But what else are they doing

57:38.019 --> 57:40.021
when they're
coming in the store?

57:40.065 --> 57:43.242
If they're not a DJ,
they're buying mixtapes.

57:43.285 --> 57:46.375
So now you've got all
these regular masses

57:46.419 --> 57:50.031
coming into a shop to buy
tickets to the regular parties

57:50.075 --> 57:51.859
they want to go to,
but then while they're there

57:51.903 --> 57:53.687
they're gonna see,
"Oh, the same DJ

57:53.731 --> 57:56.081
"that I'm gonna go to
their party has a mixtape,

57:56.124 --> 57:59.911
"Baby Blue Soundcrew."
Like, that's how it's all

57:59.954 --> 58:03.436
an ecosystem, and Play De Record
is the hub of it,

58:03.480 --> 58:05.046
which is crazy.

58:05.090 --> 58:06.961
The sounds
and energy and all that

58:07.005 --> 58:09.007
at Play De Record were,

58:09.050 --> 58:12.358
it was a distinctly
different energy on a Thursday

58:12.401 --> 58:14.012
because that's when
all the new records came in.

58:14.055 --> 58:15.535
The other stores
did Friday,

58:15.579 --> 58:18.843
but I wanted to
have a jump on them,

58:18.886 --> 58:22.977
so I decided to try and get
the music on Thursday

58:23.021 --> 58:25.458
before those guys,
then I have a day.

58:25.502 --> 58:29.288
And I would go and rush down,
go and pick it up,

58:29.331 --> 58:31.159
bring it back,
and then I have it before them.

58:31.203 --> 58:32.552
Then everybody caught on

58:32.596 --> 58:35.207
and they started
doing it on Thursdays.

58:35.250 --> 58:39.080
So, that's how Thursdays
became well-known, right?

58:43.041 --> 58:44.564
We learned
that new records came out

58:44.608 --> 58:46.523
on Thursdays.

58:54.574 --> 58:56.750
Straight in my uniform--
I went to a Catholic school,

58:56.794 --> 58:58.578
so straight downtown
in my uniform,

58:58.622 --> 59:01.059
straight to the record store,
straight to Play De.

59:01.102 --> 59:03.409
When you get out
downtown it's like,

59:03.452 --> 59:05.193
"Ahh, I'm here!"

59:05.237 --> 59:08.501
You walk in and, yeah, you
see different faces you know.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.808
You see people on the come-up.

59:10.851 --> 59:12.418
You see people
that you want to be.

59:12.461 --> 59:14.333
And you knew
what they were there for,

59:14.376 --> 59:16.727
'cause Thursday was the day.

59:16.770 --> 59:18.250
You guys
are getting it wrong.

59:18.293 --> 59:20.557
Thursday starts on Monday.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.036
On Monday, you gotta
get your orders in.

59:22.080 --> 59:24.952
Monday, you know,
all week you've been writing

59:24.996 --> 59:27.476
song titles down
on this little piece of paper,

59:27.520 --> 59:30.567
collecting from your
stratosphere of information.

59:30.610 --> 59:32.830
And then Thursday comes--
the boxes arrive!

59:32.873 --> 59:34.396
You know,
my shift would at 3.

59:34.440 --> 59:35.572
I'd make sure I'm there for 2.

59:36.747 --> 59:38.749
George would come back
from Buffalo--

59:38.792 --> 59:40.446
and everybody knew this;
the same with Eugene.

59:40.489 --> 59:41.839
Everybody knows what time
they're coming through

59:41.882 --> 59:43.492
from the border.

59:43.536 --> 59:45.190
Eugene would be
picking up the records

59:45.233 --> 59:48.759
in Buffalo.

59:48.802 --> 59:50.369
He would pick them up
at around 2 o'clock.

59:50.412 --> 59:52.023
He'd arrive at the store at 4.

59:52.066 --> 59:54.982
And it was a race.

59:55.026 --> 59:57.376
It was a race to see
who would get from Buffalo

59:57.419 --> 01:00:01.336
to Toronto faster.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.992
We'd be there looking at
each other sometimes, you know?

01:00:05.036 --> 01:00:07.038
At customs, and we would
just give the stare down.

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:08.605
I used to never talk to him.

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:11.651
He used to never talk to me.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:14.480
Hopefully,
I'd come back early enough

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:18.832
so that there's no chaos,
because those guys...

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:20.660
DJs, man...

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:22.662
They're hungry.

01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:26.884
<i>♪ Now, yeah, nowadays.
Yeah, yeah... ♪</i>

01:00:26.927 --> 01:00:28.799
<i>♪ Yeah, nowadays.</i>

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:31.062
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, nowadays.</i>

01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:34.674
But if
I come back early,

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.023
then that's great, you know?

01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:38.373
Everybody starts working,
pricing records,

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:42.029
and then get everything ready
and then bringing it out.

01:00:42.073 --> 01:00:46.381
But if I come late, then it got
chaotic because DJs come in,

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:47.644
"Hey, what's going on?"

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.036
And as soon as we
pull out the record,

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.256
everybody grabbing records.

01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:54.085
And, like, we didn't even
price the records yet.

01:00:54.128 --> 01:00:56.957
We didn't check it in.
You know what I mean?

01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:58.437
You kind of
went in there,

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.699
you were a little bit nervous,

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:01.222
you would say hi to people.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:04.138
But I was most concerned
about getting the records

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:05.662
that I wanted to get.

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:07.402
If you had
certain records--

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:10.449
like, you know, I participated
in a DJ competition

01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:12.843
for Psychosis, and this was
like in 1992,

01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:15.976
and I lost because
of one record.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.457
<i>♪ Come on downtown, follow me,
come on downtown, follow me. ♪</i>

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.893
Ruffneck
played this one

01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:21.721
Suburban Base promo
and it was the biggest record

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:23.244
that was out at the time.

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:25.203
He just literally played it
and the place went crazy,

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:27.205
and I lost the competition.

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:31.688
So that's like how important
having certain music was.

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:32.993
All the other
DJs are there,

01:01:33.037 --> 01:01:36.518
so you're meeting
whoever and whatever,

01:01:36.562 --> 01:01:38.912
and you're waiting for your pile
of records to come out.

01:01:38.956 --> 01:01:40.131
That's if you got a pile.

01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:44.135
There's the ten main guys

01:01:44.178 --> 01:01:46.703
that come in, the ten big DJs.

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:49.531
Make them bags so they don't
have to fight for the records.

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.012
So if we had ten copies
of a house record,

01:01:52.056 --> 01:01:53.753
they went in ten bags.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:55.407
Okay, there's
tick, tick, tick, tick.

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:56.887
So now we got
seven records left.

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.497
Okay, and I'd take
my deep breath,

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.021
and I would look and peek
around the wall like this,

01:02:01.065 --> 01:02:02.240
see who's in there.

01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:03.676
Nobody
knows who you are?

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.939
Chances are you're just
gonna get what's leftover

01:02:05.983 --> 01:02:09.813
at the bottom of the barrel of,
like, vinyl that came in.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.336
There's a pecking order.

01:02:11.379 --> 01:02:13.425
You kind of move your way up
and you get your standing.

01:02:13.468 --> 01:02:15.166
You get some notoriety.
People start seeing

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:17.298
your name on a flyer a lot
and they're like, "Oh!"

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:18.996
Because the flyers
are in the stores.

01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.998
The posters are in the stores,
and that's you!

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:23.130
They go to the parties and
they're like, "Oh, that's you!"

01:02:23.174 --> 01:02:24.784
This is
when you didn't have--

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:25.959
you weren't
at the respect level.

01:02:26.003 --> 01:02:27.787
I wasn't at
the respect level yet

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.397
where he's just giving me a bag.

01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:31.791
Eventually,
I got to the respect level.

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:33.924
Okay, Power's got a bag!

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:36.578
So, but at first,
you don't get that bag,

01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:38.102
so you're fighting,
fighting, fighting.

01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.668
Sometimes
you got elbowed

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:42.106
as you were trying to fight
for some new vinyl.

01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:43.542
It was like
"Lord of the Flies."

01:02:43.585 --> 01:02:46.414
They would come out
of the back with the records,

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:49.156
and they're trying to put
the records on the shelves.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.637
And, like, if it was like a hot
12-inch like Souls of Mischief,

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.988
"93 'Til Infinity,"
people are grabbing the records

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:56.816
out of whoever's stocking
the shelves' hands

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.254
before they can even
get on the shelf.

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:02.474
Yeah, I saw fistfights.

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:03.780
They would come out with records

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:05.825
and people were grabbing
like crazy.

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:08.872
So, it was intense

01:03:08.915 --> 01:03:11.788
but beautiful at the same time,

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.006
if that makes sense.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.487
Like, being there was--

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:19.317
you knew you were experiencing
something, you know?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.060
They use the word,
this term, FOMO, right?

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.975
If you weren't at
Play De Record on Thursday,

01:03:25.018 --> 01:03:26.933
you feared that you
missed something because

01:03:26.977 --> 01:03:29.762
the vibe
and the intensity was crazy.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:33.418
Man,
just for music, man!

01:03:41.861 --> 01:03:44.516
I met
everybody there.

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:46.953
People that I still consider
friends to this day,

01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:50.739
like DJs on the scene, aspiring
DJs, DJs that were already,

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:52.829
you know, doing things,

01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:56.397
and yeah, we all had that,
and it was a community vibe.

01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:59.313
It's sort of
like Cheers, right?

01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:01.663
You walk in, you know somebody.

01:04:01.707 --> 01:04:03.491
It was
the equivalent of Norm

01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:05.232
walking in from Cheers,
you know?

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:09.236
You would see
all the DJs once a week.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.369
So, you know, Son of SOUL,
rest in peace,

01:04:11.412 --> 01:04:13.240
like we would see
Son of SOUL there,

01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:15.155
and he was such
a great mentor to me

01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:16.765
and so many other DJs.

01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:18.898
He would put us on to so many
other records because

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:22.423
he was OG and he would
see us and be like,

01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:24.077
"Wow, these guys are
like taking this seriously.

01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:25.687
"Let me help them."

01:04:25.731 --> 01:04:29.387
I mean, he was very generous
with his time and his knowledge.

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:30.910
But he wasn't the only one.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:32.912
There was so many other DJs.
Dale Evans.

01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:34.783
Starting
From Scratch, Mastermind.

01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:36.655
You know,
Chris Sheppard was there.

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:37.917
You would see Hedley.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.397
Whether
it'd be Skimpy Boy

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.486
or whether it'd be
the Baby Blue guys

01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:46.099
or any number of the huge,
significant house DJs.

01:04:46.143 --> 01:04:49.842
The mixtape DJs,
the radio DJs, the club DJs.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.105
Like, the strip club DJs.

01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:54.934
Like, everybody would find
their way to Play De Record.

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:58.329
Guys were doing missions,
driving from Buffalo,

01:04:58.372 --> 01:05:00.940
from Detroit,
from New York City,

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:03.160
just to come get their record
fix in at Play De Record,

01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:05.031
you know?

01:05:05.075 --> 01:05:06.424
<i>So Chris, how
often do you come down here?</i>

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:07.904
Oh, you've gotta
make sure you're here

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:10.471
at least every Thursday,
and sometimes twice a week.

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:12.038
So is Thursday
the day that all the records

01:05:12.082 --> 01:05:13.170
come in?
Thursday's the day.

01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:14.562
We're here a little bit early.

01:05:14.606 --> 01:05:16.477
The records should be
just coming in right now.

01:05:16.521 --> 01:05:18.044
So literally
it's like waiting at the dock

01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:19.437
for the fish to come in?
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.699
That's it, that's it.
It's wicked, you know?

01:05:20.742 --> 01:05:22.135
Wow.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:23.441
Actually, I think
the records have arrived.

01:05:23.484 --> 01:05:24.790
We've beat the fish to the pond.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.661
Oh, see?

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:28.837
This is it, this is it!
The shipment has arrived!

01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:31.144
Where are the DJs?!

01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:34.104
Security!

01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:35.801
There's the guy responsible.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:56.648
We used to do
charts in the store.

01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:59.694
Medicine Muffin used to run
the drum and bass.

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:02.871
Jason Palma, hip-hop.

01:06:02.915 --> 01:06:04.134
I did the reggae.

01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:07.006
Ernest Adams
from the Outlaws did soca,

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:11.445
and Elvis did the dance stuff.

01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:13.665
I had a second location
in Scarborough

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:16.015
and we used to do
warehouse sales there.

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:18.104
I used to do some
booby traps, right?

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.150
Like, I would put like
a Puff Daddy album

01:06:20.193 --> 01:06:22.979
or Notorious BIG on sale,
it'd be like $2,

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:25.807
and people...
"Two dollars?!"

01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:28.593
I remember doing the next one
and it was a big line-up,

01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:31.117
like over 100 people around
the block, going down,

01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:32.814
what road was it?

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:36.775
Lawrence, Lawrence Avenue.

01:06:36.818 --> 01:06:39.517
Eugene opened up
a store in Scarborough?!

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.823
And what's great is, like,
I lived on Lawrence.

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:43.825
I lived at Morningside.

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:46.480
I lived around the corner from
where we are right now actually.

01:06:46.524 --> 01:06:49.092
To hear he opened up a spot
in Scarborough down the street

01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:51.268
from me, I was like,
"Yo, this is amazing."

01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:52.617
My brother asked me.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.489
He said, "You know,
we have an opportunity

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:57.622
"to build a business
in Scarborough,"

01:06:57.665 --> 01:07:00.103
and I said, "Sure.
I'll try it out."

01:07:00.146 --> 01:07:04.281
It's a lot smaller,
less hectic version of downtown.

01:07:04.324 --> 01:07:09.286
The interactions were
a little more calm, to say,

01:07:09.329 --> 01:07:11.375
but it was a great experience.

01:07:11.418 --> 01:07:14.465
And, like, being at the store
kind of became my home

01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:18.382
and people knew
to check me there.

01:07:18.425 --> 01:07:21.472
To me, it was ultimately
the dream job.

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:27.521
The first time
I came to Play De Record,

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:31.308
I believe, was when I came
to Toronto for a DJ battle.

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:33.005
All we knew is, like,

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.616
"Let's get a hotel as close to
Play De Record as we can."

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:39.664
So we stayed at the Marriott
on Yonge that was, like,

01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:41.492
you know, just above...

01:07:41.535 --> 01:07:42.928
I don't know where it was.

01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:44.756
It was crazy because
when you're a kid from Halifax

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:46.671
coming to Toronto,
everything seems so far away,

01:07:46.714 --> 01:07:49.195
and now it's like
it's next door.

01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:52.416
Yeah, I remember the first time
I walked into Play De Record.

01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:55.114
At that time, they had a lot of
illicit material in the front...

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:57.334
Or whatever.

01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:59.597
I don't know if it was illicit.
It looked like a porn shop

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.816
at the front!
And I was like,

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.775
"What's going on here?
Is this the right place?"

01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:06.038
You know?
"I feel a little shy."

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.648
Actually, I brought
one record today

01:08:07.692 --> 01:08:09.433
that I found there
the first day I was there.

01:08:09.476 --> 01:08:13.393
I found a copy of Lord Finesse,
"The Awakening,"

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:17.615
and I'd been looking for this
because there was a copy of this

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:20.748
that had the instrumentals
in it as well.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:24.317
And also, I later found out
that's DJ Mastermind's tag,

01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:27.015
so this is Mastermind's
copy of this.

01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:30.149
I remember I brought it to
the cash, Eugene looked at it,

01:08:30.193 --> 01:08:33.109
and he said, "Where'd
you find that?"

01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:35.546
And I was like,
"It was over there!"

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:36.982
I don't know.

01:08:37.025 --> 01:08:39.027
I'm still, to this day--
"Eugene, do I owe you this?"

01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:41.291
I don't know.
But this was that--

01:08:41.334 --> 01:08:43.206
I found that record
the first time I was there,

01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:46.296
and I was just amazed
that I found that there.

01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:48.254
I was super hyped,
and I'll always remember

01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:50.038
that first visit
to Play De Record.

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:53.346
So, we know about Play De Record
from watching MuchMusic.

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.479
I almost want to say, like,
on Rap City they'd have,

01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:57.307
like before commercials,
they would roll something

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:59.178
like saying it's available,
you know?

01:08:59.222 --> 01:09:01.746
Or like on extended mix,
D.C.'s Pics.

01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:05.924
Well, Master T and Dave,
his DJ, Dave Campbell,

01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:07.882
they were looking for sponsors.
They approached me.

01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:10.189
They said,
"Can you sponsor this show?"

01:09:10.233 --> 01:09:13.975
And then, MuchMusic was
all over extended mix rap CDs.

01:09:14.019 --> 01:09:16.413
They go all over Canada.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:18.980
<i>You're with
Canada's first and only music</i>

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:21.113
<i>television network, MuchMusic,</i>

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:24.072
<i>the nation's music station!</i>

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:26.292
I developed
a relationship with MuchMusic

01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:28.164
from when I used to dance
with Michie.

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:30.383
♪ The feel
is Jamaican funk! ♪

01:09:30.427 --> 01:09:33.821
And there was a girl
there named Michele Geister.

01:09:33.865 --> 01:09:35.997
If you're talking about
Ron Nelson,

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:37.608
you have to talk about
Michele Geister,

01:09:37.651 --> 01:09:41.264
because she basically
brought hip-hop to MuchMusic.

01:09:41.307 --> 01:09:43.657
So, just think about
the old Rap City and all that,

01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:44.963
that's all Michele Geister.

01:09:45.006 --> 01:09:47.095
As important as Ron Nelson is,

01:09:47.139 --> 01:09:49.881
Michele Geister
is just as important--

01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:53.624
maybe, per se,
might be even more important.

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:55.278
I actually
couldn't get her for this.

01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:58.411
She's in Jamaica.

01:09:58.455 --> 01:10:01.197
I could get her on the phone
for you if you need.

01:10:23.741 --> 01:10:26.004
Where do you want me?

01:10:49.419 --> 01:10:51.812
I think
my DJing days really started

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:55.990
with my first turntable,
which was about 11 years old.

01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:59.864
Even back as a preteen,
I was a vinyl junkie.

01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:04.738
When I babysat, that's what
I got as rewards or gifts

01:11:04.782 --> 01:11:09.395
from the people I babysat for,
was vinyl.

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:12.311
My roommate,
Karen Young, and myself

01:11:12.355 --> 01:11:16.054
were asked by
the infamous Tasmanian Ballroom

01:11:16.097 --> 01:11:19.840
to play in their
basement dancefloor.

01:11:19.884 --> 01:11:22.103
So, Pauly Lopez
is somebody, for example,

01:11:22.147 --> 01:11:24.192
who would tell me
a lot about Michele,

01:11:24.236 --> 01:11:26.107
and she really knew her music
and she was out there

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:29.328
with her records, but she was
also on the TV side of things.

01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:31.678
Music television,
MuchMusic was just starting,

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:33.724
and I knew that's
where I wanted to be.

01:11:33.767 --> 01:11:35.595
I moved to Toronto
and I was just determined

01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:37.336
I would get a job there.

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.861
One of my classmates did
get a job and she called me

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:44.256
to say they were looking for
someone, a technician position.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.520
I had been making television
since I was in high school.

01:11:47.564 --> 01:11:49.696
Welcome to another
edition of Soul in the City.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.220
Well, it's not just another
edition of Soul in the City;

01:11:52.264 --> 01:11:54.527
here we're going to
endeavour to show you

01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:57.182
some of the various forms
of house music.

01:11:57.225 --> 01:12:00.141
Soul in the City
was a video version

01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:04.407
of a radio program that the host
and creator, Michael Williams,

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.584
had done previously
when he lived in Montreal.

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:10.500
You know, my official title was
associate producer, but I wrote,

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:13.154
I researched,
I produced, I directed.

01:12:13.198 --> 01:12:15.592
And Soul in the City
was so exciting

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:18.856
and it was so well-received,
but out of a music station

01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:22.512
that was 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week, it was only one hour.

01:12:22.555 --> 01:12:26.385
And at the time,
hip-hop as starting to blow up.

01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:29.214
Oh, no doubt,
Maestro and Michie Mee,

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:33.523
Dream Warriors at that time,
and Rumble,

01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:37.657
they set the tone for Toronto,
Canadian hip-hop.

01:12:37.701 --> 01:12:40.486
Yeah, Maestro was
a huge influence on Rascals.

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:42.401
Michie Mee, and Rumble,

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:44.577
all these records,
they reached us.

01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:46.187
Like, 100%.

01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:49.234
And we were fully influenced
by and we were watching like,

01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:51.976
"Yeah, what's going
on over there?" right?

01:12:52.019 --> 01:12:55.327
Eventually, I was
lucky enough to get the call

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.112
and hear that, "Yes, you can
start working on a program."

01:12:58.156 --> 01:13:01.420
And in September 1989,

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:05.424
we had our first
half-hour edition of Rap City.

01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:14.085
Funky!

01:13:18.611 --> 01:13:20.570
Back then,
people more watched TV.

01:13:20.613 --> 01:13:22.180
There was no steaming online.

01:13:22.223 --> 01:13:25.096
There was, like, more cable,
so everybody paid attention

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:28.491
to Rap City at the time.
That was a big deal back then.

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:30.928
Like a DJ wanted to
have that exclusive vinyl,

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:33.365
I wanted to be
the one to debut a video

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.236
that no one else had seen.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.847
As soon as you
see your boy on it,

01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:39.719
or as soon as you were on it,
that was the superstar status.

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.286
That's when
you felt like a star.

01:13:41.329 --> 01:13:43.114
And I actually
remember when it dropped,

01:13:43.157 --> 01:13:45.769
and it came after
a Shaquille O'Neal video.

01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:47.466
And I remember that
and I'm thinking,

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:52.471
"Here's this NBA superstar
doing his hip-hop thing, and me,

01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:54.604
"back-to-back," and I knew
the rest of the country

01:13:54.647 --> 01:13:56.867
was watching it with me, man.
It was amazing.

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:58.303
It was literally
a dream come true

01:13:58.346 --> 01:13:59.913
because I had been dreaming
about that happening,

01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:01.959
like, since I was a little kid.

01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:06.833
We were
promoting the music,

01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:08.879
and they could go to
Play De Record and find

01:14:08.922 --> 01:14:10.402
everything they wanted there.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.012
Anything
that was playing

01:14:12.056 --> 01:14:14.754
or anything that was premiered,
whether it was MTV or MuchMusic,

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:16.234
we had to have.

01:14:16.277 --> 01:14:18.541
We did the promo,
they did the sales!

01:14:18.584 --> 01:14:22.022
I would say it would have been
how things worked.

01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:31.118
And I really
do give props to Eugene for,

01:14:31.162 --> 01:14:33.251
you know, doing what
he's done for so long.

01:14:33.294 --> 01:14:36.080
Hip-hop music has had
its challenges in Canada.

01:14:36.123 --> 01:14:38.082
It's always been hard.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:41.477
In more recent years, Drake,
you know, the Weeknd,

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.480
have blown up into huge stars.

01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:47.483
It wasn't always like that.

01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:54.838
<i>The last 12 months
have been good and bad</i>

01:14:54.881 --> 01:14:58.189
<i>for Toronto rap group
Ghetto Concept.</i>

01:14:58.232 --> 01:15:01.105
<i>On Sunday, the group collected
their second Juno in two years.</i>

01:15:01.148 --> 01:15:03.324
Last year,
we won it without a video,

01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:06.240
without major label support
and all that,

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:08.547
and we surprised everybody.
This year, we had a video.

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:11.115
We did a tour across Canada.

01:15:11.158 --> 01:15:12.725
We started
driving down there,

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:16.033
and I want to say it was in
Hamilton or something that year,

01:15:16.076 --> 01:15:20.516
and we drove and we got there,
and they had already won,

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:23.780
and we were at the top of
the escalator or whatever it is,

01:15:23.823 --> 01:15:26.565
and they were just actually
coming from wherever it is

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:29.437
taking photos,
and they're like, "Yo, we won!"

01:15:29.481 --> 01:15:33.964
And we were, like, "What?
Like, seriously?"

01:15:34.007 --> 01:15:36.749
You know, if you equate
that to like a Grammy, right?

01:15:36.793 --> 01:15:39.447
If you're saying, "Okay, well,
these two won back-to-back,"

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:42.233
you would think that a label
or somebody would be coming

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:44.235
to you to say,
"Hey, you know,

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:46.193
"let's work or let's
do something," right?

01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:48.369
So, it didn't really happen.

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:50.894
I mean, it happened,
but it didn't really morph into

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:53.244
what you would think it would,
right, so...

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:54.506
We're trying
to get out there.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.942
We're trying to be seen.

01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:57.596
And at the same time,
you know, we're at a status,

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.337
we're winning the same Junos
that other people in there

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.643
are winning.
Exactly.

01:16:00.686 --> 01:16:01.948
It's the same Juno.

01:16:01.992 --> 01:16:03.428
So, I mean, why don't
we get the same props?

01:16:03.471 --> 01:16:05.169
We had
Maestro Fresh Wes.

01:16:05.212 --> 01:16:08.607
He was probably one of the few
outside of Dream Warriors

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:12.176
that made big tracks
and trails for us.

01:16:12.219 --> 01:16:15.048
But again, after their run...

01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:17.529
So you'd think it'd
kind of pick up from there,

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.052
but it didn't.

01:16:19.096 --> 01:16:22.316
It was like there was this lull,
and I think the Canadian

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.624
music industry
just treated it like a fad.

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.452
With my album done, complete,

01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:30.237
I put it in front of them
and they told me,

01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:32.196
"How do you expect this
to make any money?

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:35.765
"It's not geared
towards white kids."

01:16:35.808 --> 01:16:37.984
And I'm like, "Well, it's
not meant to be geared

01:16:38.028 --> 01:16:39.812
"towards white kids.
It's hip-hop, right?

01:16:39.856 --> 01:16:41.988
"It's geared towards
ghetto kids, right?"

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:45.035
He goes, "Well,
that doesn't sell records."

01:16:45.078 --> 01:16:46.993
And I go, "Well, how much
do you expect it to sell?"

01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:48.473
And he goes,

01:16:48.516 --> 01:16:50.997
"Well, you'll be lucky
if you sold 5,000 records."

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:52.999
I go, "So if I put
this album out myself

01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:55.828
"and I sold 5,000 records,
you'll sign me?"

01:16:55.872 --> 01:16:58.396
He goes, "Well, if you
sell 5,000 records of this,

01:16:58.439 --> 01:17:00.137
"I'll sign you tomorrow."

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.574
I put it out and sold
20,000 records,

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.751
and I came back to him
and he still didn't sign me.

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:15.848
Black music
wasn't really embraced

01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:17.937
to that extent, you know?

01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:22.638
It wasn't as equal as some of
the other forms of music were.

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:25.771
So I don't think
people really realized

01:17:25.815 --> 01:17:30.515
the potential that hip-hop had.

01:17:30.558 --> 01:17:32.996
It was underground
to the mainstream,

01:17:33.039 --> 01:17:35.476
but it wasn't
underground to the youth.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.218
It really was a fresh,
new movement.

01:17:38.262 --> 01:17:39.872
There was just this system

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:42.048
who had decided
how much we could get.

01:17:42.092 --> 01:17:43.702
It took a lot
to put out a record.

01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:46.052
It was expensive.
It was a big process.

01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:47.837
To record a song,

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.709
you'd have to pay
$100 an hour at a studio.

01:17:50.753 --> 01:17:52.711
It would take you four hours
to record a song,

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:55.453
and then that song
had to be mastered.

01:17:55.496 --> 01:17:57.890
To master that song
takes four hours, right?

01:17:57.934 --> 01:18:00.719
So that's $800,
recording and mastering a song.

01:18:00.763 --> 01:18:03.461
And then, you have to do
an album with 12 songs.

01:18:03.504 --> 01:18:04.767
We
only became producers

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:06.290
out of necessity.

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.813
Like, we couldn't afford to
buy other people's beats.

01:18:07.857 --> 01:18:09.597
And it's not like we were like,

01:18:09.641 --> 01:18:12.339
"Yo, let's be producer-rappers."
We were like,

01:18:12.383 --> 01:18:16.430
"Well, we can't afford
to pay Scam or pay DJX,"

01:18:16.474 --> 01:18:18.084
or anybody else
that was producing at the time,

01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:19.520
so we were like...

01:18:19.564 --> 01:18:21.305
Plus,
you had to manufacture.

01:18:21.348 --> 01:18:24.264
Guys don't have to do it now
because they just download it.

01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:27.093
We weren't
doing it for the money.

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:28.660
Absolutely not.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.054
'Cause to us, if you
gave us $150 bucks, like,

01:18:31.097 --> 01:18:33.273
we would have been ecstatic.

01:18:33.317 --> 01:18:35.275
It wasn't for the money.

01:18:35.319 --> 01:18:39.149
It wasn't for anything
other than the pure love

01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:44.545
of hip-hop and wanting
to be MCs.

01:18:44.589 --> 01:18:47.026
Therefore, that's where

01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:49.463
Steppin' Bigga, Groove-A-Lot.

01:18:49.507 --> 01:18:51.814
We'd do our own stuff
and then hopefully send it down

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:54.294
to New York and maybe
one of those DJs will play it,

01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:56.906
or maybe overseas,
Japan, you know?

01:18:56.949 --> 01:19:00.170
I saw people
coming in bringing mixtapes

01:19:00.213 --> 01:19:04.435
and then bringing their own
cassettes of their own stuff.

01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:06.480
The quality wasn't so hot, right?

01:19:06.524 --> 01:19:08.134
Like, then I had an idea.

01:19:08.178 --> 01:19:11.442
I was thinking, "Why don't
I help out these guys?"

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.099
Nobody even
knew there was a basement

01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:18.188
at Play De Record,
let alone that they were

01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:19.972
working on building a studio.

01:19:20.016 --> 01:19:22.670
It was just dark
and the stairs were creaky

01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:23.933
and it was like, "Wah!"

01:19:23.976 --> 01:19:26.500
And the lightbulb
was kind of flashing.

01:19:26.544 --> 01:19:29.242
And, you know, there's just
boxes of records everywhere.

01:19:29.286 --> 01:19:31.375
There was
so much shit back there.

01:19:31.418 --> 01:19:33.812
Like, I don't know how
they had space for it all.

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:36.293
And then the studio, you'd
walk into the studio and it was,

01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:39.165
you know, nothing elaborate.

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:44.431
It was all, you know,
built by everybody.

01:19:44.475 --> 01:19:49.219
Steppin' Bigga as a business
was three people:

01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:51.395
Eugene, John Bronski,

01:19:51.438 --> 01:19:54.833
and 2 Rude was kind of
the in-house producer

01:19:54.877 --> 01:19:57.444
who'd bring in
these acts and stuff.

01:19:57.488 --> 01:19:59.882
The first artist
was Apple & Orange,

01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:01.840
and he gave me a little sample
and I was like,

01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:03.581
"Well, maybe I can
help you out."

01:20:03.624 --> 01:20:07.846
And then Rude
came with the beats,

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:09.892
and that's how we all met.

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:13.243
This is my second
release, Freaks of Reality.

01:20:13.286 --> 01:20:17.595
So then, he played me Saukrates

01:20:17.638 --> 01:20:19.684
and, like, a bunch of stuff,

01:20:19.727 --> 01:20:22.513
and Saukrates caught
my, you know, my ear.

01:20:22.556 --> 01:20:25.037
Oh, John Bronski
brought it to me.

01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:27.866
Yeah, and we listened
and I was like,

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.737
"We need to do something
with this guy."

01:20:29.781 --> 01:20:31.348
Back then,
we were like,

01:20:31.391 --> 01:20:34.873
"If anybody is gonna make it,
and really, you know,

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:37.136
"put Toronto on the map,
it was gonna be him.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.183
I really judged
a record sonically.

01:20:40.226 --> 01:20:42.359
How's that rapper's
voice sound, right?

01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:44.056
Like, does he have a cool voice?

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.493
That's why I think me
and a lot of DJs were like,

01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:48.278
"Yo, Saukrates is ill."

01:20:48.321 --> 01:20:49.845
You know,
we were all

01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:51.150
gonna record this freestyle.

01:20:51.194 --> 01:20:52.891
So, you know,
Marvel went in, did his thing,

01:20:52.935 --> 01:20:54.284
I went in, did my thing.

01:20:54.327 --> 01:20:56.590
You know, Sauks went in

01:20:56.634 --> 01:20:58.331
and we heard
this guy on the mic.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:01.160
We're like, "The f...

01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:03.119
"Yo, who is that?!"

01:21:03.162 --> 01:21:07.688
When his voice got on a real,

01:21:07.732 --> 01:21:11.214
real microphone and they were
able to pick up the sonics,

01:21:11.257 --> 01:21:13.433
life was never the same
after seeing him

01:21:13.477 --> 01:21:15.958
go into the booth for
the first time and coming out.

Every, I don't know
if it was Tuesday or Thursday--

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:55.040
I can't remember--
we'd get on the train,

01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:58.130
9th grade, and hit Yonge Street.

01:21:58.174 --> 01:22:00.132
And we'd first stop
at Play De Record,

01:22:00.176 --> 01:22:02.961
then scour Traxx
and the other two or three

01:22:03.005 --> 01:22:05.094
that were up the block.
Like, we were in it.

01:22:05.137 --> 01:22:08.053
Plus, but we wouldn't know what
it was because we had to listen

01:22:08.097 --> 01:22:10.969
on that Saturday
to the stations.

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:12.579
And once we knew
what they were playing,

01:22:12.623 --> 01:22:15.495
then we gotta go see Eugene
to start to get those songs

01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:17.758
in our own collection.

01:22:17.802 --> 01:22:20.631
So, he had a studio.

01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:22.894
He got a great engineer
in Alex G,

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.418
and they wanted to do
another one, John Bronski said.

01:22:25.462 --> 01:22:26.506
Word?

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:27.943
Yo, we get to go
to Play De Record?

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:29.379
Like, never mind,
I have to be honest,

01:22:29.422 --> 01:22:31.250
never mind the record deal part,
we're like,

01:22:31.294 --> 01:22:33.426
"Yo, we get to go
to Play De Record?"

01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:35.341
That's how
I connected there,

01:22:35.385 --> 01:22:37.561
but I'd been buying records
from Play De Record

01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:39.041
for two years prior to that,

01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:41.434
so I was familiar
with the building,

01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:43.436
and I knew it was a Mecca.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.745
So when I got invited to record
in the studio of the Mecca...

01:22:50.008 --> 01:22:53.055
<i>Yo, live on WKMA,</i>

01:22:53.098 --> 01:22:54.839
<i>you've got yo nigga Kool-Aid.</i>

01:22:54.882 --> 01:22:57.276
<i>You got
in the house too, G.</i>

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.018
<i>Yo, steppin' up we have that
nigga from the East Side,</i>

01:23:00.062 --> 01:23:01.498
<i>Saukrates.</i>

01:23:01.541 --> 01:23:03.413
<i>Representing
that's shit's from.</i>

01:23:03.456 --> 01:23:05.893
<i>Yo, Saukrates, step up and show
'em what you can do, nigga.</i>

01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:07.721
<i>♪ They get
caught in ill positions. ♪</i>

01:23:07.765 --> 01:23:10.028
<i>♪ Famous quote from me,
Saukrates. ♪</i>

01:23:10.072 --> 01:23:11.899
<i>♪ Groupies rock my boat,
I used to step lightly. ♪</i>

01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:14.032
Internationally known,

01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:16.339
locally accepted.

01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:17.514
You gotta do both.

01:23:17.557 --> 01:23:19.037
If you do that, you're gone.

01:23:19.081 --> 01:23:20.778
And Eugene
gave me the opportunity

01:23:20.821 --> 01:23:22.345
to be locally accepted.

01:23:22.388 --> 01:23:24.564
And once it's pressed on
the vinyl, you ship it,

01:23:24.608 --> 01:23:26.305
then you're
internationally known.

01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:29.091
For the independent
artist to go into Play De Record

01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:31.528
and say, "Hey, Eugene, I got
a new record I want to put out,"

01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:33.530
it was a lot more
challenging with, like,

01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:35.314
an HMV or a Sam
the Record Man or whatnot.

01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:37.316
You couldn't walk into
Sam the Record Man and say,

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.014
"Oh, I put out a new record.

01:23:39.057 --> 01:23:40.624
"Do you guys wanna
give it a listen?"

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:42.539
"Take a seat in the back
or something."

01:23:42.582 --> 01:23:43.801
I don't know,
"Step outside.

01:23:43.844 --> 01:23:45.063
"We'll call you
when we're ready."

01:23:45.107 --> 01:23:46.847
So, I asked
Eugene if I could do

01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:48.240
a Rap Essentials display,
and he was like,

01:23:48.284 --> 01:23:49.981
"Oh, no, I'll put it
in there for you."

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.591
I'm like, "No, no, no,
I want the whole window."

01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:53.245
"I don't know:
Daddy would say no."

01:23:53.289 --> 01:23:55.639
And I'm like, "Eugene, come on.
Just let me do it one week."

01:23:55.682 --> 01:23:57.641
I don't know how it happened,
but he said yes.

01:23:57.684 --> 01:24:00.296
"Yo, when you
get the posters, let me know.

01:24:00.339 --> 01:24:02.472
"I'll post it up when
you've got the shows.

01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:04.213
"I'll put out the flyer."

01:24:04.256 --> 01:24:06.824
He put it right in front
so everybody could see it.

01:24:06.867 --> 01:24:08.260
The money
was always there.

01:24:08.304 --> 01:24:10.088
My mixtapes were
flying at that time,

01:24:10.132 --> 01:24:11.916
but he always made sure
the bread was straight

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:13.483
or, like, the count was good.

01:24:13.526 --> 01:24:15.528
Or, you know, we always had
a section to sell our tapes,

01:24:15.572 --> 01:24:18.444
and it didn't matter if there
was 50 other MCs, you know,

01:24:18.488 --> 01:24:20.011
trying to sell their
mixtapes or whatever.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.969
Like, he always made sure
we were good inside the spot.

01:24:22.013 --> 01:24:24.450
At the time,
I remember, you know, my dad,

01:24:24.494 --> 01:24:27.540
Delroy G, showcasing,
bringing the dope,

01:24:27.584 --> 01:24:30.674
real reggae music to
Toronto for years now.

01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:33.372
When I got my record up there,
I was like,

01:24:33.416 --> 01:24:36.549
"Oh, I want my record to be just
like how when me and my dad

01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:41.337
were rolling through, picking up
all these vintage records."

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.468
But yeah,
when you do come in here

01:24:42.512 --> 01:24:43.948
and you do see
Saukrates on the wall,

01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:45.906
you see Da Grassroots on
the wall or something like that,

01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:48.387
you would know
that people were making

01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:50.650
some of those records
to get on this wall.

01:24:50.694 --> 01:24:53.523
So, I think that that says
something about even

01:24:53.566 --> 01:24:56.134
being the outlet, being the goal
for a lot of these people.

01:24:56.178 --> 01:24:57.266
Mixtapes, too.

01:24:57.309 --> 01:24:58.615
I want my mixtape
to be right behind.

01:24:58.658 --> 01:25:00.007
I want to have that hot spot.

01:25:00.051 --> 01:25:03.446
Like, that environment

01:25:03.489 --> 01:25:06.449
helped stimulate the art
that comes from a city.

01:25:06.492 --> 01:25:08.625
I think there's
a direct connection.

01:25:08.668 --> 01:25:11.062
You know, me and Eugene,
we were spending, like,

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.282
every night,
like all day, all night.

01:25:13.325 --> 01:25:16.154
You know, we slept
in the studio some nights.

01:25:16.198 --> 01:25:20.419
I remember even
when I finished, I...

01:25:20.463 --> 01:25:22.378
pssht!
I was opening the store.

01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:23.857
I didn't even sleep sometimes.

01:25:23.901 --> 01:25:27.122
Now, we didn't get
too far because, I mean,

01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:28.906
it was a financial strain
for, you know,

01:25:28.949 --> 01:25:33.389
the Tam Family to have this
label that, you know, wasn't--

01:25:33.432 --> 01:25:35.391
it was always in the red.

01:25:35.434 --> 01:25:40.135
At that time,
you promo DJ pools and stuff,

01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:43.138
and they would play on
the radio and push this stuff.

01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:45.314
If they like it,
whatever, right?

01:25:45.357 --> 01:25:46.924
We promoed the stuff,
and the next thing I know

01:25:46.967 --> 01:25:48.491
it was all over on the internet,

01:25:48.534 --> 01:25:52.234
people downloading,
and nobody buying.

01:25:52.277 --> 01:25:57.152
So, that kind of soured my,
you know, soured me, and I said,

01:25:57.195 --> 01:25:59.806
"You know what?
I'm done with this."

01:25:59.850 --> 01:26:02.418
That was a really rough time.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:09.033
It was my day off
with some friends, and I go,

01:26:09.076 --> 01:26:10.817
"Let me pop into Play De."
I needed to grab something

01:26:10.861 --> 01:26:13.080
from the back or ask Eugene
something; I couldn't remember.

01:26:13.124 --> 01:26:14.821
I walk in and the gate's up.

01:26:14.865 --> 01:26:16.432
I'm like,
"What the hell's going on?"

01:26:16.475 --> 01:26:18.347
Why is the gate up?
It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:20.697
It shouldn't be closed.
The lights are on.

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.612
I see Eugene in there.
I see people in there.

01:26:22.655 --> 01:26:26.006
I opened the shop,
turned everything on,

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.226
got everything going
in the store.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:30.707
So I walk down
and I start to open the gate,

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:32.752
and some guy I don't recognize,

01:26:32.796 --> 01:26:34.537
some older white guy with
a moustache, he's like,

01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.191
"Excuse me, sir."

01:26:36.234 --> 01:26:38.323
And then I see Eugene over and
he just looks at me and he goes,

01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:39.803
"Jason?
No, no, no.

01:26:39.846 --> 01:26:41.152
"Go, go."

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.545
I found out, obviously later,

01:26:42.588 --> 01:26:44.721
that it was the RCMP
that told me not to come in.

01:26:44.764 --> 01:26:49.465
25, 30 cops,
and undercovers, said,

01:26:49.508 --> 01:26:51.031
"Hold it right there,"

01:26:51.075 --> 01:26:54.513
like to me and the other
employee that was there.

01:26:54.557 --> 01:26:57.995
And I can't remember
who was there.

01:26:58.038 --> 01:27:01.999
I think it was a co-op student
actually, to be honest with you.

01:27:02.042 --> 01:27:05.916
They said that they're
coming for the mixtapes

01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:08.527
because of copyright infringement.

01:27:08.571 --> 01:27:10.050
And I remember
Peter calling me on the phone

01:27:10.094 --> 01:27:11.313
and going,
"We just got busted.

01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:13.097
"They're charging me."

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:14.577
I said, "Okay, Peter,
I'm on my way,"

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.926
because I was
on my way to work.

01:27:15.969 --> 01:27:17.493
I told them, I said,
"I'm the owner.

01:27:17.536 --> 01:27:18.668
"You know,
you need to charge me."

01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:19.799
We went through the courts.

01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:21.497
It got dropped.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:24.282
I remember I was talking
to Kid Kut, and he said,

01:27:24.326 --> 01:27:26.632
"Baby Blue is putting out
a new mixtape,"

01:27:26.676 --> 01:27:29.287
and he goes,
"We're gonna put it on CDs."

01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:31.333
"Man, I don't know
if you should do that,

01:27:31.376 --> 01:27:34.292
"because now
we're putting stuff up

01:27:34.336 --> 01:27:36.207
"on the, like, top format."

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.905
It was a new thing,
burning on CDs,

01:27:38.949 --> 01:27:41.081
so we started burning onto CDs,

01:27:41.125 --> 01:27:44.563
and then eventually
we ended up pressing CDs.

01:27:44.607 --> 01:27:46.522
And when
they started making CDs,

01:27:46.565 --> 01:27:49.612
they really started competing
with the record labels,

01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:52.528
and that's what made
them take notice, right?

01:27:52.571 --> 01:27:54.965
You know, obviously,
DJs are selling mixtapes

01:27:55.008 --> 01:27:57.881
without having their approval,
but that's all fucked up

01:27:57.924 --> 01:27:59.491
because at the end of the day,

01:27:59.535 --> 01:28:01.928
all those DJs that are doing
mixtapes were getting free music

01:28:01.972 --> 01:28:04.714
that the record companies were
giving them to promote that.

01:28:04.757 --> 01:28:08.413
The record labels would
service DJs and record pools,

01:28:08.457 --> 01:28:11.764
and part of the service was you
had to fill out response sheets

01:28:11.808 --> 01:28:13.288
for the records
they were servicing.

01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:15.290
They wanted to know what
you thought of these records.

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:16.813
One of the questions
on those surveys,

01:28:16.856 --> 01:28:18.467
on every record that you got,

01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:21.383
"Would you put
this song on your mixtape?"

01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:24.777
At the time,
there was a culture

01:28:24.821 --> 01:28:28.041
that was made up
of DJs and taste-makers,

01:28:28.085 --> 01:28:31.349
independent labels,
and record shops,

01:28:31.393 --> 01:28:33.830
and the clothing store,
and everybody was like

01:28:33.873 --> 01:28:36.789
working together
to build something here.

01:28:36.833 --> 01:28:39.792
What it felt like to me
was like the labels

01:28:39.836 --> 01:28:42.621
were clearing the runway
to do their thing.

01:28:42.665 --> 01:28:45.145
You ask me
how it affected Eugene,

01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:46.756
he had to go to court.

01:28:46.799 --> 01:28:51.064
He spent thousands
upon thousands of dollars

01:28:51.108 --> 01:28:53.458
to defend himself,

01:28:53.502 --> 01:28:56.156
and it weighed heavy on him
in those years.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.593
I know that for sure.

01:28:57.636 --> 01:28:59.725
Well,
yeah, it was, like,

01:28:59.769 --> 01:29:02.598
kind of disheartening because,
like, everybody is doing it.

01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:04.121
Everybody is selling.

01:29:04.164 --> 01:29:06.428
Labels?
Well, you know what?

01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:10.040
I'm not too sure if I feel
comfortable talking about it.

01:29:10.083 --> 01:29:15.262
But everybody was doing it,
and they picked us.

01:29:15.306 --> 01:29:16.438
You know what I mean?

01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:19.658
Why us?

01:29:19.702 --> 01:29:21.573
His parents
had a heavy dictation

01:29:21.617 --> 01:29:23.488
on what was happening
with the business.

01:29:23.532 --> 01:29:26.491
It was their business as much
as it was Eugene's business,

01:29:26.535 --> 01:29:28.754
and they were there constantly,
aware of everything

01:29:28.798 --> 01:29:31.409
and watching over, like hawks,
what was going on.

01:29:31.453 --> 01:29:34.151
When the cops came in,
that spooked Daddy and Mommy

01:29:34.194 --> 01:29:35.631
as much as it spooked Eugene,

01:29:35.674 --> 01:29:39.417
and I think
that together eventually

01:29:39.461 --> 01:29:43.856
is why Eugene asked
if I wanted to buy the business.

01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:08.141
Sasha was
born in 1992.

01:30:08.185 --> 01:30:10.056
She is a leap year baby.

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:15.192
And my son was born in 1995.

01:30:15.235 --> 01:30:16.976
I didn't get to see them much.

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.849
I used to be in the store here
at 12 o'clock.

01:30:19.892 --> 01:30:24.375
Sometimes I'd go
and pick up stuff, do stuff.

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:26.986
There used to be, like,
a very small office

01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:28.988
and a kitchen in the back,

01:30:29.032 --> 01:30:32.731
and my brother and I would do
homework there most days.

01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:35.647
Yeah, after school
we would come back to the store

01:30:35.691 --> 01:30:37.736
and just waited around
until we went home,

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.260
so we would just
eat dinner there,

01:30:40.304 --> 01:30:42.132
do homework, play around.

01:30:42.175 --> 01:30:44.264
I would only see them
at 12 o'clock at night.

01:30:44.308 --> 01:30:45.614
They're supposed to be sleeping,

01:30:45.657 --> 01:30:47.659
but they're hiding
when they hear me coming.

01:30:47.703 --> 01:30:49.748
I would hide at home
before my dad came home

01:30:49.792 --> 01:30:51.184
and then surprise him.

01:30:51.228 --> 01:30:53.099
I guess it was just the way
'cause we didn't really

01:30:53.143 --> 01:30:54.492
see him for a lot, right?

01:30:54.536 --> 01:30:56.668
And even if my parents
were at the store,

01:30:56.712 --> 01:30:58.409
I remember trying
to stay up till, like,

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:01.107
11 or 12 when they came back
home to, like, see them,

01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:05.198
but it didn't always work out.

01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:07.853
I just still think it was like
my dad's other child almost,

01:31:07.897 --> 01:31:11.596
because he was here
the majority of the time.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.076
You know,
I was going every Thursday

01:31:13.119 --> 01:31:14.599
to pick up records.

01:31:14.643 --> 01:31:16.166
The records are still coming in

01:31:16.209 --> 01:31:20.953
and they still gotta
go out, right?

01:31:20.997 --> 01:31:24.609
So, bringing those two guys in
was-- you know, helped.

01:31:32.399 --> 01:31:35.185
I was working around
the corner at Covenant House

01:31:35.228 --> 01:31:38.797
and spent any free moment
I had in the shop.

01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:41.887
Got to know Eugene,
of course, and Donna,

01:31:41.931 --> 01:31:44.803
and then Eugene and Donna
were now young parents.

01:31:44.847 --> 01:31:47.458
I think both of them really
wanted to be able to focus

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:48.590
on their family a bit more

01:31:48.633 --> 01:31:50.243
and they were
looking for an out.

01:31:50.287 --> 01:31:53.029
So they mentioned it to Jason,
and Jason mentioned it to me.

01:31:53.072 --> 01:31:55.771
And one day Eugene
came up to me and he goes,

01:31:55.814 --> 01:31:57.555
"We're thinking about
selling the business.

01:31:57.599 --> 01:31:59.818
"Are you interested?"
I said, "Yeah."

01:31:59.862 --> 01:32:01.820
I didn't think I could
do it on my own.

01:32:01.864 --> 01:32:03.300
Nav was my very good friend.

01:32:03.343 --> 01:32:05.737
We were just like, "Yeah!
Let's do it!"

01:32:05.781 --> 01:32:08.305
Effectively, at that point,
we bought Play De Record.

01:32:08.348 --> 01:32:11.526
The deal was Eugene and Donna
stay on for six months.

01:32:11.569 --> 01:32:13.484
You know, a consultancy period.

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:16.008
But when Nav
and I brainstormed ideas

01:32:16.052 --> 01:32:17.836
and talked to Eugene,
Eugene got excited

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.404
and he got a new zest
for it and said,

01:32:20.447 --> 01:32:21.536
"You know what?
I'm gonna stay."

01:32:21.579 --> 01:32:23.842
Thankfully,
we devised this schedule

01:32:23.886 --> 01:32:25.931
that worked for Eugene
and Donna to remain.

01:32:25.975 --> 01:32:28.064
When I look back, I mean,

01:32:28.107 --> 01:32:29.718
damn, if it had
gone any other way,

01:32:29.761 --> 01:32:32.372
it would have been
a catastrophe.

01:32:32.416 --> 01:32:34.853
I could have walked
away from the store, you know?

01:32:34.897 --> 01:32:38.074
But he loves it,
so he continues.

01:32:38.117 --> 01:32:40.903
I think being here all day
is not work for him.

01:32:40.946 --> 01:32:44.080
He loves being here all day,
listening to music.

01:32:48.127 --> 01:32:51.522
I was always
going to motivational courses

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:55.178
and looking at other businesses,
thinking, you know,

01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:57.702
"How can I, you know,

01:32:57.746 --> 01:33:01.488
"maybe diversify just in case
something happens to the store?"

01:33:01.532 --> 01:33:05.188
Which, you know, some of
the stuff I learned, like,

01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:06.537
you set a goal

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:10.019
and you do whatever
it takes to get that goal.

01:33:10.062 --> 01:33:13.631
So it doesn't matter
if I didn't sleep or whatever,

01:33:13.675 --> 01:33:16.634
I'd just go and I'd try
to achieve that goal.

01:33:16.678 --> 01:33:19.419
And even to this day,
I still do the same thing,

01:33:19.463 --> 01:33:20.638
where if somebody is
looking for something,

01:33:20.682 --> 01:33:23.859
I try my best to try
and get it to them.

01:33:23.902 --> 01:33:27.297
Sometimes the DJs would ask me,

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.952
"Bring me a record in the club."

01:33:29.995 --> 01:33:31.562
I was like,
"Oh, come on, man.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.303
"Do you really
need this record?"

01:33:33.346 --> 01:33:36.001
But I know the DJ needs it
because, you know,

01:33:36.045 --> 01:33:39.788
one of my things also is
the music can't stop.

01:33:39.831 --> 01:33:43.269
I just kind of-- the music's
gotta keep on going.

01:33:52.278 --> 01:33:55.542
I think a lot of how
we've been able to maintain

01:33:55.586 --> 01:33:57.762
and stay at such a high level
for so long is

01:33:57.806 --> 01:33:59.808
a lot of it is how
we deal with people.

01:33:59.851 --> 01:34:01.592
And I did learn
a lot of that from him.

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:04.160
I got, you know,
my asshole side from George,

01:34:04.203 --> 01:34:06.466
how to not take shit
from people,

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:09.121
and I got the camaraderie,
community thing from Eugene.

01:34:09.165 --> 01:34:11.341
If you ask me, like, a moment
where one started to pull away

01:34:11.384 --> 01:34:13.038
from the other,
I couldn't tell you.

01:34:13.082 --> 01:34:16.520
But Eugene outsold us.
100%, I know that for a fact.

01:34:16.563 --> 01:34:18.565
That bothered me,
but once I got out of it,

01:34:18.609 --> 01:34:20.742
I was like, I don't know
how old I was in 2000,

01:34:20.785 --> 01:34:22.134
but it was over.

01:34:22.178 --> 01:34:24.702
Like, I walked away from it.
I was good with it.

01:34:24.746 --> 01:34:26.225
No, it didn't bother me.

01:34:26.269 --> 01:34:28.619
But during the competition,
oh, he used to bother me!

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:29.968
He used to bother me.

01:34:30.012 --> 01:34:31.666
Actually, funny you say that--

01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:33.929
Eugene bought all my records.

01:34:33.972 --> 01:34:36.496
Call up Eugene,
he comes to my dad's house,

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.063
he went through my records,

01:34:38.107 --> 01:34:40.718
started nickel and diming here
and I said, "Look, Eugene,

01:34:40.762 --> 01:34:45.157
"either you take the whole batch
or you don't take it at all."

01:34:45.201 --> 01:34:46.811
And I took that money

01:34:46.855 --> 01:34:49.205
and I bought
a dock at my cottage,

01:34:49.248 --> 01:34:50.946
which I should call
Play De Record,

01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:52.904
which I still have up to now,

01:34:52.948 --> 01:34:55.254
that I built a dock
with the money he gave me.

01:34:55.298 --> 01:34:57.430
True story.

01:34:57.474 --> 01:34:59.084
I'm just shocked
that he's still doing it.

01:34:59.128 --> 01:35:00.999
Like, I mean,
is the industry still there?

01:35:01.043 --> 01:35:02.784
Are people buying records?

01:35:02.827 --> 01:35:06.788
Like, why is he still just
kicking the bucket doing that?

01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:08.746
How long
did the Thursday thing last?

01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:11.357
Like when did it--
Oh, forever.

01:35:11.401 --> 01:35:13.664
Until, like, the 2010s.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:15.231
You know what I mean?

01:35:15.274 --> 01:35:16.798
That's when things
started-- poof!

01:35:16.841 --> 01:35:18.451
Digital, man.

01:35:18.495 --> 01:35:20.062
Digital killed it.

01:35:20.105 --> 01:35:23.935
Serato
is a program or a software

01:35:23.979 --> 01:35:28.766
that basically allows DJs
to use digital files

01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:31.203
from their laptop
or from a hard drive.

01:35:31.247 --> 01:35:33.075
You can use it
with CD turntables.

01:35:33.118 --> 01:35:35.033
You can use it with
regular turntables.

01:35:35.077 --> 01:35:36.252
You can use it
with a controller.

01:35:36.295 --> 01:35:38.645
But you can also
just connect to a mixer

01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:40.343
and you can play
your whole entire set

01:35:40.386 --> 01:35:41.910
literally just off
your computer.

01:35:41.953 --> 01:35:44.086
When Serato came out in 2005,

01:35:44.129 --> 01:35:47.263
a lot of guys already
had a lot of digital files,

01:35:47.306 --> 01:35:50.440
so they were kind of already
ready to go there.

01:35:50.483 --> 01:35:53.617
Once I got to try it, oh
my god, this is a game-changer.

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.097
I couldn't stop
talking about it.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:58.317
And I remember, I flew out
to Vancouver with Kid Kut.

01:35:58.361 --> 01:36:00.580
Because it was so much,
my actual luggage,

01:36:00.624 --> 01:36:02.713
my personal luggage of
clothing and stuff like that,

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:05.803
as well as these
two massive crates,

01:36:05.847 --> 01:36:09.024
the airline charged
me like $160, $170

01:36:09.067 --> 01:36:11.330
to bring those crates back,
and I was so pissed.

01:36:11.374 --> 01:36:14.203
And as soon as I landed back
in Toronto, I bought a laptop,

01:36:14.246 --> 01:36:16.031
and I never looked back.

01:36:16.074 --> 01:36:18.773
I could do the exact
same job and bring ten times

01:36:18.816 --> 01:36:20.731
the amount of records with me

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:25.040
with a frickin' laptop
and two controllers?

01:36:25.083 --> 01:36:26.868
Like, hell yeah, I'm with it.

01:36:26.911 --> 01:36:28.870
For me personally,
it's just something that I--

01:36:28.913 --> 01:36:30.175
you had to do.

01:36:30.219 --> 01:36:31.786
You had to keep up
with the times.

01:36:31.829 --> 01:36:34.049
With everything
being on a USB,

01:36:34.092 --> 01:36:36.486
you could bring your whole
collection on your laptop.

01:36:36.529 --> 01:36:39.532
I don't see a full return
to vinyl ever happening.

01:36:39.576 --> 01:36:41.970
But it wasn't like
digital files came out

01:36:42.013 --> 01:36:44.929
and then instantaneously
killed the scene,

01:36:44.973 --> 01:36:47.714
but definitely over time.

01:36:47.758 --> 01:36:49.455
I mean, I can't remember
the last time I bought

01:36:49.499 --> 01:36:51.414
a 12-inch, frankly, you know?

01:36:51.457 --> 01:36:54.112
Because you have access
to it all the time,

01:36:54.156 --> 01:36:56.506
anywhere, anytime now.

01:37:02.686 --> 01:37:04.993
As a young kid,
as a teenager,

01:37:05.036 --> 01:37:09.040
working in the record store,
dictating what people buy,

01:37:09.084 --> 01:37:10.955
I mean, that was kind of
the attitude of it.

01:37:10.999 --> 01:37:14.829
Once people had
the freedom of MP3s,

01:37:14.872 --> 01:37:16.091
it didn't matter anymore.

01:37:16.134 --> 01:37:17.962
They can tell you
what's hot now.

01:37:18.006 --> 01:37:20.704
So, naturally, it slowed down.

01:37:20.747 --> 01:37:23.533
Club DJs were the first to go.

01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:25.013
Yeah, we noticed it.

01:37:25.056 --> 01:37:27.319
We'd notice less things
being pressed on vinyl.

01:37:27.363 --> 01:37:29.408
We'd notice certain
DJs dropping off

01:37:29.452 --> 01:37:32.585
and not showing up anymore,
DJs that would come regularly.

01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:36.981
When Thursday was 100
or 150 people going crazy,

01:37:37.025 --> 01:37:39.288
it started to be 60 people.

01:37:39.331 --> 01:37:40.898
Everything
went down a little bit.

01:37:40.942 --> 01:37:42.769
When Scratch Live came,
a little bit went down.

01:37:42.813 --> 01:37:45.250
When Serato came in,

01:37:45.294 --> 01:37:47.209
a lot went down.

01:37:47.252 --> 01:37:49.124
So, we had to find
other ways, you know?

01:37:52.344 --> 01:37:53.998
<i>The beat's
about to switch again</i>

01:37:54.042 --> 01:37:57.349
<i>at Play De Record.</i>

01:37:57.393 --> 01:38:01.745
<i>First vinyl, then DJ equipment,
now the funky store on Yonge</i>

01:38:01.788 --> 01:38:04.661
<i>is opening
a learning centre in the back.</i>

01:38:04.704 --> 01:38:07.446
Honestly, it's really
hard to find an environment

01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:09.144
where you can
sit down and learn.

01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:10.667
You feel like it's impossible

01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:12.451
to be able to do
something like this.

01:38:12.495 --> 01:38:15.237
And that was crazy
because he had enough foresight

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.893
to be like, "Okay,
how do I evolve or transition?"

01:38:18.936 --> 01:38:21.547
Or, "Okay, maybe the record
side of it is not bringing in

01:38:21.591 --> 01:38:22.940
"as much income as it used to,

01:38:22.984 --> 01:38:24.289
"so what can we do
to supplement that?"

01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:27.249
By setting up
a DJ school in a store

01:38:27.292 --> 01:38:31.340
that was infamous for
the DJ world,

01:38:31.383 --> 01:38:33.168
you're now bringing
that potentially

01:38:33.211 --> 01:38:35.126
to a new generation of people.

01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:37.433
And again, you know, Eugene
had the foresight to be like,

01:38:37.476 --> 01:38:40.001
"Let's help keep
this culture going."

01:38:40.044 --> 01:38:42.873
But again, like,
everybody learns on...

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:44.875
Get free lessons on YouTube,

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:46.921
just like how
they get free music.

01:38:46.964 --> 01:38:49.575
All that stuff, you know,
to try and weather the storm,

01:38:49.619 --> 01:38:51.055
we knew what was going on.

01:38:51.099 --> 01:38:53.666
We knew that, you know,
it was gonna be a challenge.

01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:56.234
But at the end of the day,
we kind of also trusted

01:38:56.278 --> 01:38:57.844
there's always
gonna be music lovers

01:38:57.888 --> 01:38:59.150
and there's always
gonna be people

01:38:59.194 --> 01:39:02.458
who love the medium,
you know, of vinyl.

01:39:02.501 --> 01:39:04.242
I have
a love for the music,

01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:05.852
but the music product.

01:39:05.896 --> 01:39:07.811
To this day,
I'm still very meticulous about

01:39:07.854 --> 01:39:10.248
how my album cover looks,
the liner notes,

01:39:10.292 --> 01:39:12.511
all of the credit information.

01:39:12.555 --> 01:39:15.993
DJ Jace,
I did a remix for him this year.

01:39:16.037 --> 01:39:19.910
He met me in the food court
from my place of work,

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:22.086
and he handed me this record,

01:39:22.130 --> 01:39:25.263
and I very excitedly
started screaming

01:39:25.307 --> 01:39:26.873
and scared
a lot of the elderly people

01:39:26.917 --> 01:39:28.179
that were in the food court.

01:39:28.223 --> 01:39:31.487
I didn't actually think
that I would see my name

01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.098
on a record for a long time,
and I almost cried,

01:39:34.142 --> 01:39:36.666
which I really
had to control myself

01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:39.756
because of the number
of people that were around.

01:39:39.799 --> 01:39:41.932
Now that
it is a more limited thing,

01:39:41.976 --> 01:39:43.325
it's a bit more special.

01:39:43.368 --> 01:39:45.588
It's like the same way
people like real photographs

01:39:45.631 --> 01:39:46.719
and things like that.

01:39:46.763 --> 01:39:48.678
It's like a physical
piece of media.

01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:50.506
But when Serato came 'round,
it was like,

01:39:50.549 --> 01:39:52.812
"Yeah, okay, cool,
I still got it," you know?

01:39:52.856 --> 01:39:55.119
Like, "I'm gonna beat the curve
and I'm gonna find ways

01:39:55.163 --> 01:39:57.034
"to get the record."
But then, eventually,

01:39:57.078 --> 01:39:58.688
people coming up to you
at the club being like,

01:39:58.731 --> 01:39:59.950
"Can you play this?"
and I'm like,

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:01.473
"Ah, I'm still waiting
for it to get pressed."

01:40:01.517 --> 01:40:02.518
Then they're like,

01:40:02.561 --> 01:40:04.563
"What are you?
What's a press?"

01:40:04.607 --> 01:40:09.220
You know what I mean?
It doesn't make sense.

01:40:09.264 --> 01:40:11.657
If
a record is scratched,

01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:13.181
you may not be able to play it.

01:40:13.224 --> 01:40:16.532
You're in close quarters
and the audience is around you.

01:40:16.575 --> 01:40:18.403
People could be, you know,
knocking the table.

01:40:18.447 --> 01:40:20.405
People could be
knocking the needle,

01:40:20.449 --> 01:40:23.060
and it could really
affect your performance.

01:40:25.410 --> 01:40:27.282
Serato
was like that thing,

01:40:27.325 --> 01:40:29.806
it was the gift and the curse
because it gave us everything

01:40:29.849 --> 01:40:31.460
that we really wanted.

01:40:31.503 --> 01:40:34.637
As DJs, me personally,
I hated carrying crates.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:37.596
But at the same time,
it tore our hearts out

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:41.687
because we lost
that sense of community.

01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:43.385
As an entrepreneur,
I got into, like,

01:40:43.428 --> 01:40:46.910
bars and venues
and opened a club of my own,

01:40:46.953 --> 01:40:49.043
and it made sense for me
to exit at that point.

01:40:49.086 --> 01:40:50.914
It was emotional
for years and years,

01:40:50.957 --> 01:40:53.003
and still is a little
emotional, you know?

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:57.312
Like, definitely a high point
of my, you know,

01:40:57.355 --> 01:40:59.401
my life and my career.

01:40:59.444 --> 01:41:03.318
You know, it was
a really fun place to work.

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:09.628
As someone who
essentially spent a lot of time,

01:41:09.672 --> 01:41:13.763
years on Yonge Street,
a lot of the smaller businesses

01:41:13.806 --> 01:41:17.549
that had hung on
for all those years

01:41:17.593 --> 01:41:20.248
were now getting taken over
by the major corporations.

01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:24.469
Well, when that property
tax went up $7,000, man,

01:41:24.513 --> 01:41:27.298
I said, "We can't do this."
It's...

01:41:27.342 --> 01:41:30.127
We're not even
making money, right?

01:41:30.171 --> 01:41:33.304
And for that to happen,
we said, "Look."

01:41:33.348 --> 01:41:39.093
So, we were deciding
if to continue or not, right?

01:41:39.136 --> 01:41:42.661
Jason didn't want to continue,
so it was just me alone.

01:41:42.705 --> 01:41:45.011
We had talked about
closing the shop, many times,

01:41:45.055 --> 01:41:47.057
because it was hard.

01:41:47.101 --> 01:41:49.190
You know,
it's not the same business

01:41:49.233 --> 01:41:50.800
as it was obviously in the '90s.

01:41:50.843 --> 01:41:53.150
And then Eugene said,
"Well, let's move it."

01:41:53.194 --> 01:41:55.848
And I go, "Okay."
I was open to the idea.

01:41:55.892 --> 01:41:58.155
There was a spot on Spadina
that Eugene showed me,

01:41:58.199 --> 01:42:00.070
and I go,
"It's cool, I like it."

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:03.943
But I really did some
soul-searching myself

01:42:03.987 --> 01:42:05.989
and I felt I needed to go
another direction in my life.

01:42:06.032 --> 01:42:08.470
So once the Yonge Street
location closed down,

01:42:08.513 --> 01:42:12.474
I decided to move on
and let Eugene take it over.

01:42:30.231 --> 01:42:32.624
We used to do
scratchers together, like,

01:42:32.668 --> 01:42:35.061
you know, the scene
and get people together.

01:42:35.105 --> 01:42:39.501
We did the last one that was
in the actual Yonge Street,

01:42:39.544 --> 01:42:40.980
the OG store.

01:42:41.024 --> 01:42:42.547
Eugene let us do it.

01:42:42.591 --> 01:42:46.072
A good send-off, I suppose,
for the OG store.

01:42:53.384 --> 01:42:55.821
Eugene,
a couple other people who were

01:42:55.865 --> 01:42:57.997
Play De Record loyalists,

01:42:58.041 --> 01:43:01.305
we all took a picture
in front of the sign.

01:43:01.349 --> 01:43:03.481
And I remember after we took
the picture, I was just like,

01:43:03.525 --> 01:43:06.441
"This is part
of Toronto culture."

01:43:06.484 --> 01:43:09.400
And that location
on Yonge Street

01:43:09.444 --> 01:43:11.620
is just a part of history.

01:43:11.663 --> 01:43:13.796
I felt it when he had to move.

01:43:13.839 --> 01:43:15.319
You know the Sam's sign?

01:43:15.363 --> 01:43:17.103
They got the Sam's sign they
have on top of that thing.

01:43:17.147 --> 01:43:19.280
They should tear that down
and put the Play De Record sign

01:43:19.323 --> 01:43:20.542
there, on top of there.

01:43:20.585 --> 01:43:24.241
Because that's just
as, like, well-known as,

01:43:24.285 --> 01:43:27.592
and probably even bigger than,
Sam the Record Man.

01:43:30.029 --> 01:43:31.335
I'm super nostalgic

01:43:31.379 --> 01:43:33.163
when we talk about
this stuff, man.

01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:35.948
Like, going down memory lane
and thinking about the places

01:43:35.992 --> 01:43:40.257
and the sounds
and the smells of, like,

01:43:40.301 --> 01:43:45.741
being in this
movement at this time.

01:43:45.784 --> 01:43:49.875
There's institutions that were
a part of the come-up

01:43:49.919 --> 01:43:52.965
of this city, and they
don't exist anymore,

01:43:53.009 --> 01:43:54.184
or they've changed,

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.839
and, you know,
I understand the evolution.

01:43:56.882 --> 01:44:00.843
It means that what we see today
won't ever be what it was,

01:44:00.886 --> 01:44:05.413
but it's nice to think about it.

01:44:05.456 --> 01:44:08.416
Well... all good things
come to an end.

01:44:34.616 --> 01:44:36.792
I got a wire
from Eugene that says,

01:44:36.835 --> 01:44:37.967
"Oh, come check out
the new store."

01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:39.708
I walked in there
and it was like

01:44:39.751 --> 01:44:41.187
if nothing had ever changed.

01:44:41.231 --> 01:44:44.756
I think it felt the same
because Eugene was there,

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.368
and so he is the store.

01:44:47.411 --> 01:44:49.761
Home is where Eugene is.

01:44:55.245 --> 01:44:56.333
I just keep hoping.

01:44:56.377 --> 01:44:59.423
I'm not sure yet
what I'm gonna do yet.

01:44:59.467 --> 01:45:01.295
But when you're so busy

01:45:01.338 --> 01:45:02.948
and you're always
involved with music

01:45:02.992 --> 01:45:07.779
and you're ordering every day,
and especially now where

01:45:07.823 --> 01:45:11.740
mostly I'm alone,
so I'm doing everything.

01:45:11.783 --> 01:45:14.873
I'm picking out records,
looking at records, digging,

01:45:14.917 --> 01:45:19.182
sorting records, filling up
the bins, checking stock,

01:45:19.225 --> 01:45:22.620
cashing people,
answering phone calls,

01:45:22.664 --> 01:45:24.840
answering questions
about equipment,

01:45:24.883 --> 01:45:27.843
which I don't really--
it's not my forte.

01:45:27.886 --> 01:45:32.456
So even doing this
documentary has me thinking,

01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:36.155
when I do all the pros and cons,
"Alright, this is what we did,"

01:45:36.199 --> 01:45:38.941
and then even now
I'm thinking,

01:45:38.984 --> 01:45:41.770
"This could be the end."

01:45:41.813 --> 01:45:44.033
But I'm not sure yet.

01:45:44.076 --> 01:45:47.384
Many times, I thought
maybe we might have to close,

01:45:47.428 --> 01:45:48.994
because really,
it wasn't making any--

01:45:49.038 --> 01:45:50.605
we don't make any money, really.

01:45:50.648 --> 01:45:52.737
I'm just doing it for...

01:45:52.781 --> 01:45:57.089
I don't even know
what I'm doing it for!

01:45:57.133 --> 01:46:01.616
And for me, I never could
have done what I was doing

01:46:01.659 --> 01:46:02.965
at the level I was doing it

01:46:03.008 --> 01:46:06.708
without his contribution
to my life,

01:46:06.751 --> 01:46:11.060
my career as a DJ,

01:46:11.103 --> 01:46:14.193
and everything
that I was about back then.

01:46:14.237 --> 01:46:17.588
He...

01:46:17.632 --> 01:46:20.635
Yeah.
I mean, I owe him so much.

01:46:30.601 --> 01:46:32.821
You know,
I think one of the reasons

01:46:32.864 --> 01:46:35.127
he's considered such a legend

01:46:35.171 --> 01:46:37.782
and he's so revered in this city
is because of how sweet he is,

01:46:37.826 --> 01:46:40.132
how generous he is,
and how, you know,

01:46:40.176 --> 01:46:44.528
I don't think he's got
a mean bone in his body.

01:46:44.572 --> 01:46:46.095
Without Play De Record,

01:46:46.138 --> 01:46:48.445
oh, my career probably would
have went another path.

01:46:48.489 --> 01:46:51.187
If you ask any DJ in Toronto
that bought records

01:46:51.230 --> 01:46:53.972
back in the '90s, it's like,
if there was no Play De Record,

01:46:54.016 --> 01:46:57.672
your DJ career might not
have been where it is today.

01:47:01.284 --> 01:47:02.633
I'll call him
more for help

01:47:02.677 --> 01:47:04.461
than he'll call
anybody for help.

01:47:04.505 --> 01:47:06.158
Last winter,
you know, my family,

01:47:06.202 --> 01:47:07.638
we were trying to
get things together.

01:47:07.682 --> 01:47:09.335
I had to call him for some help.
He's like...

01:47:09.379 --> 01:47:10.554
"Done!"

01:47:10.598 --> 01:47:12.817
And we hadn't spoken
for about ten years.

01:47:12.861 --> 01:47:14.471
But Eugene never changed.

01:47:14.515 --> 01:47:16.212
As long as I treat
him with respect,

01:47:16.255 --> 01:47:20.825
he'll treat me like family,
like a nephew.

01:47:20.869 --> 01:47:23.828
The passion was clearly
there at Play De Record.

01:47:23.872 --> 01:47:25.482
Passionate about the music,

01:47:25.526 --> 01:47:29.965
who wanted to deliver it
to people to share it.

01:47:30.008 --> 01:47:32.054
The understanding
that Toronto needed

01:47:32.097 --> 01:47:34.883
to tell its story,

01:47:34.926 --> 01:47:37.320
and Eugene and Play De Record
being a part of that

01:47:37.363 --> 01:47:40.497
was something
that we all believed in.

01:47:40.541 --> 01:47:42.804
I take my kids there.

01:47:42.847 --> 01:47:44.327
They don't even know
what the fuck a record is,

01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:46.460
but I just take 'em there.

01:47:46.503 --> 01:47:49.332
"You don't understand right now,
son, but you need to stand here,

01:47:49.375 --> 01:47:51.421
"like, right now."

01:47:56.121 --> 01:48:00.430
The music, which is
the soundscape to our lives,

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:03.085
would not be possible without
a place to go buy those records

01:48:03.128 --> 01:48:04.826
so people can hear them,

01:48:04.869 --> 01:48:06.915
and that's a major
community hub.

01:48:06.958 --> 01:48:08.482
That's what this is all about.

01:48:08.525 --> 01:48:10.658
Like, without Play De Record,
you know,

01:48:10.701 --> 01:48:12.355
would the culture be the same?

01:48:12.398 --> 01:48:14.444
I don't know!
Maybe not.

01:48:24.106 --> 01:48:25.760
I think it's...

01:48:25.803 --> 01:48:29.677
It will still live on.

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:34.377
That passion that he had
for a record store,

01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:37.162
you know, I have never
seen it anywhere else, right?

01:48:37.206 --> 01:48:40.688
It's a family-owned business.

01:48:40.731 --> 01:48:45.040
You know, there's not
that many of that around.

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:47.825
It's not a corporation.

01:48:47.869 --> 01:48:49.348
He doesn't have shares.

01:48:49.392 --> 01:48:53.701
You know, he just does
what he loves, you know?

01:48:53.744 --> 01:48:58.793
So, I think that legacy
will continue on forever.

01:49:05.495 --> 01:49:08.367
It's only when we
started doing this documentary,

01:49:08.411 --> 01:49:11.719
I-- "Oh, maybe we did
have something to do with it."

01:49:15.244 --> 01:49:16.506
I never saw it.

01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:20.031
Like, you know,
when you have to step back...

01:49:20.075 --> 01:49:21.642
then you see the picture, right?
