00:01.410 --> 00:02.684
- I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK.
DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY?

00:02.790 --> 00:03.370
- YEAH.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.823
- IF MY WIFE WAS STILL ALIVE

00:05.930 --> 00:07.272
AND SHE ASKED ME
TO TAKE A TRIP TO ITALY,

00:07.380 --> 00:10.759
I'D BUY TWO FIRST-CLASS TICKETS
AND BEAT HER ASS TO THE AIRPORT.

00:10.870 --> 00:13.521
- I WAS READING THIS BOOK FOR
MAX, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:13.630 --> 00:15.689
I'M NOT READING ABOUT THE KID
ANYMORE, I'M READING ABOUT ME.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.552
- I WAS THINKING
THAT WE SHOULD

00:17.670 --> 00:18.694
TRY AND SEE
A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.142
- I DON'T WANT TO SEE
A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR

00:21.260 --> 00:21.976
BECAUSE THE MARRIAGE
IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.398
THE PROBLEM IS YOU.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.877
- I KNOW THAT IF YOU
LET THIS KID GO

00:25.990 --> 00:28.049
AND YOU DON'T SAY GOOD-BYE,

00:28.160 --> 00:30.082
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

[Joy Division's Isolation]

JUST SEE THE BEAUTY

00:47.150 --> 00:50.278
THESE PLEASURES
A WAYWARD DISTRACT ION

02:19.000 --> 02:20.262
- I CAN SIGN YOU UP.
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

02:20.380 --> 02:21.756
DAD AND VICTOR ARE RUNNING
WITH TEAM COYOTE.

02:21.860 --> 02:25.375

AND I WILL MAKE SURE

02:29.940 --> 02:32.249
THAT I GET DAD'S

NO, I WENT OUT
TO GET DOUGHNUTS!

02:41.470 --> 02:43.461

02:45.260 --> 02:46.602
- ALL RIGHT,

02:46.710 --> 02:48.462

I GOT IT FIRST.

YOU COULD USE IT HERE

03:22.440 --> 03:24.089
AT THE RECORDING STUDIO

HASN'T TOLD HER PARENTS

04:42.240 --> 04:42.854

- YEAH, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M GONNA TELL YOU, THOUGH.

FOR DR. PELIKAN'S PHONE NUMBER.

08:18.110 --> 08:20.829
- OKAY. DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN WITH MAX?

08:20.940 --> 08:23.329
- NO, THAT'S WHAT I ASKED HIM.

08:23.430 --> 08:24.977
BUT THEN HE SAID
IT'S FOR ANOTHER MA'I'I'ER.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.011
- ANOTHER MA'I'I'ER.
AND YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME--

08:26.120 --> 08:28.463

08:34.440 --> 08:36.647
- I DON'T KNOW,
I MEAN, HE'S QUIRKY.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.638
- HE'S VERY QUIRKY.
- RIGHT?

08:38.750 --> 08:40.160
- AND SOCIALLY AWKWARD.
- HE'S VERY FOCUSED.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.329
HE'LL TALK TO MAX ABOUT LENSES
FOR HOURS.

08:42.450 --> 08:44.372
- HOURS.
- EXPOSURES FOR HOURS.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.653
CAMERAS FOR HOURS.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.206
- JUST LIKE BUGS.
- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS--

08:49.320 --> 08:52.699
- NO, BUT I CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK THAT IF HE DOES,

08:52.800 --> 08:54.142
THEN MAYBE MAX COULD
TURN OUT TO BE LIKE HIM.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.832
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

08:56.950 --> 08:58.019
- NO.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.087
- HANK'S HAD A BUSINESS.
HE'S HAD RELATIONSHIPS.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.329

09:02.500 --> 09:03.637
WITH YOUR SISTER.
- YEAH, WELL...

09:03.750 --> 09:05.320

- HE HAS A DAUGHTER.
- RIGHT?

09:07.090 --> 09:08.887
- OH, YEAH.
BUT THEY DON'T GET ALONG.

09:08.990 --> 09:09.843
- HE'S A FATHER.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.541
WELL, SHE EXISTS.
- SHE DOES EXIST.

09:11.650 --> 09:14.266
- WHEN I LOOK AT THAT, THAT'S
A PRETTY BRIGHT FUTURE FOR MAX.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.894
- HMM.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.059
- SO...

09:19.170 --> 09:20.922
- ARE WE...
- WHAT?

09:21.040 --> 09:23.793
- HOPING THAT
HE HAS ASPERGER'S?

09:23.900 --> 09:26.698
- NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THAT'D--

09:26.800 --> 09:28.108
I MEAN, MAYBE ON SOME LEVEL.

09:28.220 --> 09:31.667
- THAT WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLE.
- THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.209
- WOW.
- YEAH.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.012
- HANK.

FIND A PLACE FOR IT?

09:44.200 --> 09:44.950
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
I LOVE IT.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.881
I JUST--
I WANT TO GET IT FRAMED.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.161
- YOU WANT ME TO FRAME IT?

09:50.270 --> 09:54.036
- UH, YEAH.
I INTEND TO PAY YOU FOR IT.

09:54.140 --> 09:55.619
- ALL RIGHT.
- BUT I WAS THINKING

09:55.730 --> 09:57.004
RED WOULD BE REAL BOLD.
KIND OF FUN.

09:57.110 --> 09:59.556
- NO, IT'S HORRIBLE.
HORRIBLE CHOICE, RED.

09:59.660 --> 10:02.834
YOU WANT TO GO SIMPLE.
BLACK. KEEP IT SIMPLE.

10:02.940 --> 10:04.976
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.593
- YEAH.
- GOOD THING I CAME TO YOU.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.327
- ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA DO
A COUPLE THINGS HERE.

10:08.430 --> 10:10.284
I GUESS I COULD GET IT
TO YOU LATER TONIGHT,

10:10.400 --> 10:11.776
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.869
- THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FAST. THAT'S GREAT.

10:12.990 --> 10:13.297
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET ON IT LATER.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.984
- OKAY.

10:17.090 --> 10:18.227
UH, HEY, HANK.

10:18.340 --> 10:19.784
JUST SO LONG AS I'M HERE...

10:19.890 --> 10:24.680
YOU DON'T HAPPEN
TO PLAY POKER, DO YOU?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.850
- YEAH, I PLAY POKER.

10:32.490 --> 10:36.108
[phone rings]

10:39.010 --> 10:40.045
- HELLO?
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

10:40.150 --> 10:42.732
UNCLE ADAM SAID
YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL,

10:42.840 --> 10:44.842
SO I GOT YOU
SOME CHICKEN SOUP.

10:44.950 --> 10:48.465
- OH. I'M NOT HOME RIGHT NOW.
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT AT HOME,

10:48.570 --> 10:50.322
BECAUSE I'M STANDING
OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR

10:50.440 --> 10:51.190
WITH A BIG PILE
OF CHICKEN SOUP.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.269
WHERE ARE YOU?
- I'M AT THE DRUGSTORE.

10:54.370 --> 10:56.782
I'M JUST GETTING SOME MEDICINE
AND STUFF, SO MAYBE--

10:56.890 --> 10:57.993
[seagulls cawing]
- MM-HMM.

10:58.100 --> 11:01.376
OKAY, WELL, UM, SHOULD I
JUST WAIT FOR YOU, THEN?

11:01.480 --> 11:03.584
- UM...

11:03.690 --> 11:06.443
I'M NOT
AT THE DRUGSTORE, MOM.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.482
- UH-HUH.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.069
AMBER, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:10.180 --> 11:13.627
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'M--I'M DRIVING AROUND.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.288
I'M AT THE BEACH RIGHT NOW.
- HONEY, WHERE?

11:16.390 --> 11:20.019
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DRIVING AROUND?
- UH, I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.088
- LOOK, I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

11:22.190 --> 11:24.010
YOU SHOULDN'T JUST BE
OUT THERE DRIVING AROUND.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.337
LET ME MEET YOU SOMEWHERE.
WE'LL HAVE A SOUP OR SOMETHING.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.852
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW, MOM.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.814
I JUST NEED TO BE ALONE
RIGHT NOW.

11:30.930 --> 11:32.261
- AMBER, I JUST WORRY ABOUT YOU.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.098
YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE CAR
IF YOU'RE UPSET.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.405
- I'LL BE SAFE.
I PROMISE, OKAY?

11:36.520 --> 11:38.545
- YOU SOUND TERRIBLE.
THIS MAKES ME VERY WORRIED.

11:38.660 --> 11:39.274
JUST COME HOME.
- I GOTTA DO THIS, OKAY?

11:39.380 --> 11:41.177
BUT I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.909
- I'M GONNA CALL YOU
IN AN HOUR.

11:46.050 --> 11:47.176
[sighs]

11:52.400 --> 11:54.846
- THOSE KIDS ARE WIPED OUT.

11:54.950 --> 11:56.053
- WELL, THEY WERE REALLY HAPPY

11:56.160 --> 11:58.811
THAT YOU WERE HOME TONIGHT
TO PUT 'EM TO BED.

12:11.350 --> 12:13.932
ARE WE JUST NOT
GONNA TALK ABOUT IT?

12:14.040 --> 12:17.692
- [exhales]
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

12:17.800 --> 12:21.861
- ABOUT WHERE YOU SLEPT
THE OTHER NIGHT?

12:21.980 --> 12:23.493
- SERIOUSLY?
- I HAVE A RIGHT

12:23.600 --> 12:26.216
TO KNOW WHERE YOU'VE SLEPT.
- YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T--

12:26.330 --> 12:29.879
I DIDN'T MAKE THIS MESS, JULIA.
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T MAKE IT.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.019
- OKAY, I'M...

12:35.130 --> 12:36.677
BELIEVE ME, I WISH I COULD
GO BACK AND I COULD

12:36.790 --> 12:38.121
DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY,

12:38.240 --> 12:41.198
BUT I NEVER
JUST DIDN'T COME HOME.

12:42.450 --> 12:45.851
- I, UH...

12:45.970 --> 12:50.418
I WENT TO THE TRAILER
AND I GOT DRUNK AND PASSED OUT.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.419
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?

12:56.530 --> 12:58.213
- WHAT A'El'T/IWE DOING?

12:58.320 --> 13:02.461
I--YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

13:02.570 --> 13:06.631
I KNOW WU’MT I'M DOING.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.775
I'VE GOT, UH,
AN 8:00 AM.

13:08.890 --> 13:10.289
I'M MEETING WITH PEET
TO GO OVER THE GROUNDS.

13:10.410 --> 13:14.198
AT 4:00 I'VE GOT TO TRAIN
WITH VICTOR FOR A JOG-A-THON,

13:14.310 --> 13:15.880
AND, OH,
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

13:16.000 --> 13:16.716
POKER WITH YOUR BROTHERS
TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.548
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THAT.

13:18.650 --> 13:20.060
- I DON'T HAVE TO GO?
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE A BIG ISSUE.

13:20.170 --> 13:21.819
THE BRAVERMAN HOTLINE WON'T BE

13:21.930 --> 13:24.933
RINGING OFF THE HOOK
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.032
WE GOT ENOUGH RUMORS
FLYING AROUND.

13:28.150 --> 13:30.380
I DON'T KNOW, JULIA.

13:30.490 --> 13:32.560
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE DOING WITH OUR LIVES.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.763
I'VE JUST GOT TO...

13:34.880 --> 13:39.362
[sighs]
JUST GOTTA GET ON WITH MINE.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.408
- GOSH, YOU'RE UP EARLY.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.863
- [chuckles]
IT'S 10:00.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.198
- RIGHT. WELL, OKAY.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.414
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO TODAY?

14:01.530 --> 14:03.486
- OH, UH, THIS GAL
I MET ON THE TRIP,

14:03.600 --> 14:05.556
SHE PINGED ME.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.116
SHE'S AT MOMA
FOR THE LUCIAN FREUD EXHIBIT.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.448
I KNOW IT'S BAD TIMING,
BUT SHE'S ONLY HERE

14:09.570 --> 14:13.802
FOR THE ONE NIGHT AND I WANTED
TO SEE THE SHOW ANYWAY, SO,

14:13.920 --> 14:17.014
YOU KNOW,
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU...

14:17.130 --> 14:20.190
- YEAH, YEAH, SURE, WELL,
I GOT STUFF TO DO AROUND HERE.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.119
IT'S OKAY, YEAH.

14:21.230 --> 14:22.265
- WELL, I'LL BE HOME
WAY BEFORE DINNER.

14:22.370 --> 14:24.782
I'LL FIX US SOMETHING LOVELY.

14:24.890 --> 14:28.405
- OKAY, WELL, HAVE FUN.
- OKAY.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.680
THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING.

14:29.790 --> 14:32.031
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.938
SEE YA. BUONGIORNO.

14:40.980 --> 14:41.833
- SO, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THAT WAY

14:41.950 --> 14:45.044
JUST FOR AS LONG
AS MY EARLIEST MEMORY.

14:45.160 --> 14:45.774
FIVE, SIX, WHATEVER IT WAS.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.940
I JUST KIND OF DECIDED

14:49.060 --> 14:51.437
VEGETABLES HAD TO BE
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLATE

14:51.540 --> 14:54.338
AND THINGS HAD TO BE
JUST A CERTAIN WAY

14:54.440 --> 14:57.193
OR I JUST COMPLETELY
FREAKED OUT.

14:57.310 --> 15:00.404
BUT I GOT BETTER, THOUGH.
OVER THE YEARS,

15:00.520 --> 15:02.272
I GOT BETTER.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.689
I MEAN, STILL,

15:04.800 --> 15:08.065
I BASICALLY HAVE TWO GEARS.

15:08.180 --> 15:12.105
I COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN
OR I GO FOR IT.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.279
TENACIOUS WAS THE WORD
THAT MY EX-WIFE USED

15:14.390 --> 15:18.144
TO DESCRIBE ME
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED.

15:18.260 --> 15:21.946
LATER IT WAS "BULLDOG."

15:22.050 --> 15:24.325
OR "BULLY."

15:24.440 --> 15:27.329
OR SOMETHING WORSE THAN THAT,
YOU KNOW,

15:27.440 --> 15:30.295
BUT, HEY,
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE

15:30.410 --> 15:33.197
WOULD DESCRIBE
THEIR EXES LIKE THAT.

15:33.310 --> 15:34.993
- [chuckles] YES, THEY WOULD.
- YEAH.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.159
BUT ANYWAY, SO I WAS READING
A BOOK THAT ADAM GAVE ME

15:37.280 --> 15:38.895
ON ASPERGER'S,
AND SOMETHING CLICKED.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.206
- HMM.

15:40.310 --> 15:42.039
- YEAH, I MEAN, I DON'T
WANT TO HAVE ASPERGER'S.

15:42.140 --> 15:45.029
YOU KNOW, COME ON,
IT'S JUST...

15:45.150 --> 15:47.357
ANYWAY, SO I TOOK THE TEST.
I TOOK THE TEST ONLINE.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.143
- OH, YOU DIDN'T SAY
YOU TOOK THE TEST.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.387
HOW DID YOU SCORE?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.491
- YEAH, I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT?
YEAH, I DID.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.488
I SCORED, UH, HIGH. 40...

15:55.880 --> 15:57.495
42-ISH, YOU KNOW.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.328
BUT IT'S AN ONLINE TEST.
HOW ACCURATE CAN THAT BE?

15:59.440 --> 16:02.398
- IT CAN BE PRETTY ACCURATE.

16:02.510 --> 16:05.195
HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT THESE BEHAVIORS

16:05.300 --> 16:06.949
AFFECT OTHER PARTS
OF YOUR LIFE,

16:07.060 --> 16:08.573
BESIDES THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE?

16:08.690 --> 16:13.036
- WELL, I HAVE A VERY
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS, I-I...

16:13.140 --> 16:14.368
I HAD TO DOWNSIZE LAST YEAR.

16:14.490 --> 16:15.411
THAT'S BECAUSE I MOVED TO
MINNESOTA, THOUGH,

16:15.520 --> 16:18.341
TO BE WITH MY DAUGHTER.
- MM-HMM.

16:18.460 --> 16:19.529
- YEAH, I MEAN,
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.929
EH...

16:23.050 --> 16:25.189
I GUESS, UH, I GUESS...

16:25.290 --> 16:27.667
THINGS COULD BE BETTER

16:27.770 --> 16:31.319
WITH RUBY, MY DAUGHTER.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.913
I GUESS I WANT TO KNOW
IF THERE'S A REASON

16:36.020 --> 16:39.228
WHY I'VE BEEN BLOWING IT

16:39.340 --> 16:41.683
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I JUST

16:41.790 --> 16:46.272
CARE ABOUT THE MOST IN MY LIFE.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.998
YOU KNOW?
IF I KNOW, THEN MAYBE...

16:50.110 --> 16:53.967
MAYBE I CAN STOP BLOWING IT.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.006
YOU KNOW?
MAYBE I CAN CHANGE.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.872
- WELL...
ASPERGER'S IS NEUROLOGICAL.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.460
AND SOMETIMES KNOWING
THAT YOU HAVE IT CAN NOT ONLY

17:07.570 --> 17:11.085
BE A RELIEF BUT A PATH
TO ACQUIRING TOOLS

17:11.200 --> 17:14.920
FOR HEALTHIER SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIPS MOVING FORWARD.

17:15.030 --> 17:16.474
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, THEN?
YOU'RE SAYING THAT I DO HAVE IT.

17:16.580 --> 17:19.925
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW
IN AN HOUR.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.759
I'D NEED TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH YOU,

17:21.860 --> 17:23.202
I'D HAVE YOU TAKE SOME TESTS.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.131
- LOOK, I KNOW, I KNOW,
YOU GOT YOUR METHODS AND ALL,

17:26.250 --> 17:27.649
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.834
JUST BALLPARK IT FOR ME,
YOU KNOW, GIVE ME--

17:32.940 --> 17:34.805
WHAT'S YOUR GUT ON THIS?

17:37.910 --> 17:42.700
- MY GUT...
[exhales]

17:42.820 --> 17:45.050
IS THAT IT'S A JUMP BALL.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.811
THE SPECTRUM IS VERY WIDE.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.888
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT YOU
DEFINITELY HAVE ASPERGER'S.

17:49.990 --> 17:51.878
- I GOT IT. I KNOW, I KNOW.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.444
I KNOW WHAT JUMP BALL MEANS.

17:53.550 --> 17:56.587
YOU KNOW,
NOT THAT ASPERGER'S-Y.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.237
YEAH. I GET IT.

17:58.350 --> 17:59.658
CAN'T TELL ME THAT I DO,

17:59.760 --> 18:02.206
AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME
THAT I DON'T.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.919
- DREW.

18:15.020 --> 18:16.464
DREW, HOLD UP.
- HEY.

18:16.570 --> 18:18.083
- YOU'RE, LIKE, RUNNING.
- NO, I'M NOT.

18:18.200 --> 18:18.575
- AWAY FROM ME.
YES, YOU ARE.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.887
ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:20.990 --> 18:23.231
THE PROFESSOR DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
GIVING US DETAILS FOR TONIGHT

18:23.340 --> 18:24.432
AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
HALFWAY OUT THE DOOR.

18:24.550 --> 18:26.575
- I LEFT MY NOTES IN--
- HIGH SCHOOL GIRLFRIEND?

18:26.690 --> 18:29.784
IN YOUR DORM ROOM?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.107
LOOK, I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
WANT A RELATIONSHIP.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.552
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
AWKWARD AROUND ME.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.241
- [chuckles]
I'M NOT AWKWARD AROUND YOU.

18:35.350 --> 18:38.695
- OKAY, FINE.
'CAUSE I MISS YOU.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.246
- I MISS YOU TOO.

18:42.740 --> 18:44.879
- UM, SO I'LL MEET YOU
TONIGHT AT 9:00?

18:44.980 --> 18:47.562
FOR THE BUS.

18:47.670 --> 18:48.568
GRIZZLY PEAK.
ARE YOU DOING THIS HIKE TONIGHT?

18:48.670 --> 18:51.389
- OH, I HAVEN'T DECI--
IS THAT MANDATORY?

18:51.500 --> 18:54.389
- NO, BUT DREW, COME ON.
WE'RE TAKING ASTRONOMY.

18:54.510 --> 18:57.638
THE EARTH IS, LIKE, INTERSECTING
WITH A COMET TONIGHT.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.365
- YEAH.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.549
- YEAH, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

19:00.650 --> 19:01.856
I'M REALLY BAD AT SCIENCE.
- YEAH, ME NEITHER.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.439
I'M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU DON'T EITHER.

19:03.550 --> 19:06.348
- YEAH, WELL, THERE'S GONNA BE
AN AWESOME METEOR SHOWER.

19:06.450 --> 19:07.610
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.

19:07.730 --> 19:11.109
HAVE YOU?

19:11.210 --> 19:13.792
- NO. THEY HAPPEN
EVERY YEAR, THOUGH.

19:13.910 --> 19:16.219
- OKAY.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.696
NO, THAT'S COOL.

19:17.810 --> 19:19.903
JUST GO DO LAUNDRY WITH YOUR
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLFRIEND.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.703
I GET IT.
- [sighs]

19:21.810 --> 19:24.699
- YEAH, BERTO MENTIONED
THE WHOLE LAUNDRY THING.

19:24.810 --> 19:26.050
IT'S PRECIOUS, THOUGH.
- YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE IT.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.152
HE'S NOT VERY LOYAL, BUT--
- NO, HE'S JUST IN COLLEGE.

19:29.270 --> 19:30.646
SO ARE YOU.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.854
COME ON, MAN.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.444
- YOU INVITED HANK.

19:40.550 --> 19:41.869
- YES.
- SARAH'S EX-BOYFRIEND HANK.

19:41.970 --> 19:43.517
HAN K-HAN K.
- YEAH. WHAT?

19:43.630 --> 19:44.938
WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR GUYS
TO INVITE TO THE POKER GAME.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.587
- YEAH, NORMAL GUYS.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.452
- WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.595
- LOOK, I LIKE HANK,
DON'T PAINT ME OUT

19:49.700 --> 19:51.213
TO BE A BAD GUY
FOR STATING THE OBVIOUS.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.048
- WHICH IS WHAT?

19:52.150 --> 19:54.630
- THAT HE IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

19:54.740 --> 19:58.039
HE DOESN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT,
HE MUMBLES,

19:58.160 --> 20:00.390
HE IS NOT A GOOD
CONVERSATIONALIST.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.432
MINIMALLY,
WE CAN AGREE ON THAT.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.155
- WELL, NOT EVERYBODY
IS A MASTER

20:03.270 --> 20:04.430
OF SOCIAL INTERACTION,

THAT HE BE A MASTER

20:06.100 --> 20:08.614
OF SOCIAL INTERACTION,
I'M JUST SAYING HE COULD BE...

20:08.720 --> 20:10.642
NOT A FREAK AND WE COULD
MAYBE ALL HAVE SOME BEERS

20:10.760 --> 20:11.920
AND SOME CIGARS...
- LOOK, CROSBY, I INVITED HIM.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.066
- JOKE ABOUT SEX...
- YOU INVITE GUYS ALL THE TIME.

20:14.170 --> 20:15.489
- YES, I INVITE GUYS
WHO GET IT.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.865
- HE GETS IT. HE PLAYS POKER.
HE'S COMING. THAT'S IT.

20:17.970 --> 20:19.449
DEAL WITH IT.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.584
- WHOA, HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
SO REWED UP ABOUT?

20:20.700 --> 20:22.725
- HE HAS BEEN
A GODSEND FOR MAX,

20:22.840 --> 20:25.729
AND I THINK THAT
YOU COULD BE A LITTLE NICER

20:25.840 --> 20:26.909
ABOUT INCLUDING SOMEBODY
WHO MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

20:27.010 --> 20:30.218

AT TIVOLI'S.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.464

VERY EXPENSIVE.

A BAGEL OR WHATEVER.

23:19.010 --> 23:23.663
YOU'VE BEEN MISSING
A LOT OF CLASS.

- TO TUFTS?

23:29.780 --> 23:32.908
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I HATE IT THERE.

23:33.030 --> 23:36.545
I MEAN, THE GIRLS
ARE SNOBBY AND COLD,

23:36.650 --> 23:40.711
AND THE WEATHER'S DEPRESSING,
AND EVERYONE IS SO SMART.

23:40.830 --> 23:43.105
- SO ARE YOU.
- YEAH, WELL, NOT LIKE THEM.

23:43.210 --> 23:44.962
AND MY ROOMMATE IS AWFUL TO ME.

23:45.070 --> 23:47.868
- THE ROOMMATE THING
IS DIFFICULT.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.416
I UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT POSTER.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.792
- AT LEAST YOURS TALKS TO YOU.

23:51.910 --> 23:53.525
MINE DOESN'T EVEN
SAY HELLO TO ME.

23:53.630 --> 23:56.190

23:56.290 --> 23:59.669
- SWITCH ROOMMATES.

23:59.780 --> 24:01.941
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:06.370 --> 24:07.917
- WHAT?

24:09.480 --> 24:14.065
- I STARTED TO FEEL ALONE,
LIKE...

24:14.170 --> 24:17.230
LIKE SCARY ALONE.

24:22.350 --> 24:25.558
- SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO BACK?

24:25.670 --> 24:27.979
- I CAN'T. I CAN'T GO BACK.

24:28.080 --> 24:32.949
'CAUSE THE ONE THING THAT GOT ME
OUT OF THAT SCARY ALONE PLACE

WAS YOU.

YOU'RE THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES
SENSE TO ME RIGHT NOW.

24:41.440 --> 24:45.570
YOU'RE KIND OF ALL I HAVE.

- HI! WHATHII SURPRISE.

- HI.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:01.430 --> 25:03.978
- UM...
- UH-OH.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.287
- I HAD A FRIEND...

25:06.400 --> 25:08.049
A FRIEND.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.288
BUT HE KISSED ME.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.981
AND--
- WAIT, HE KISSED YOU?

25:13.090 --> 25:15.149
- HE KISSED ME.

25:15.270 --> 25:17.545
- AND YOU DIDN'T KISS HIM BACK?

25:17.650 --> 25:21.609
- I DON'T--

25:21.720 --> 25:22.926
I PROBABLY
SHOULD'VE PULLED AWAY

25:23.030 --> 25:27.137
A HALF A SECOND EARLIER...
THAN I DID.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.720
BUT I C--

25:29.830 --> 25:33.345
IT'S N--IT'S--WE'RE NOT EVEN
FRIENDS ANYMORE, YOU KNOW?

25:33.460 --> 25:35.109
IT WAS JUST, LIKE, A...

25:35.220 --> 25:38.940
AND THEN I THOUGHT
THAT I SHOULD TELL JOEL.

25:39.050 --> 25:42.224
BUT THEN WHEN I TOLD HIM,
HE DIDN'T COME HOME.

25:42.330 --> 25:45.083
HE SLEPT AT WORK
IS WHAT HE SAID.

25:45.190 --> 25:49.365
- FOR HOW LONG?
- JUST FOR ONE NIGHT, BUT...

25:49.470 --> 25:51.438
I DON'T KNOW,
HIS BOSS IS ALSO--

25:51.550 --> 25:54.997
I DON'T KNOW,
IF YOU MET HER OR SAW HER...

25:55.100 --> 25:57.159
- DO YOU THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON?

25:57.270 --> 25:59.830
- I DON'T--

25:59.930 --> 26:01.682
I HOPE...

26:01.800 --> 26:05.691
NOT,
BUT HIS REACTION WAS SO...

26:05.800 --> 26:07.973
DRAMATIC TO MINE
THAT I DON'T KNOW

26:08.080 --> 26:11.561
IF HE'S TRYING TO JUSTIFY
SOMETHING ON HIS END.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.706
- I THINK THAT MIGHT'VE
JUST BEEN A SHOCK

26:13.810 --> 26:17.701
THAT YOU LET A HALF A SECOND
TOO LONG GO BY,

26:17.810 --> 26:20.779
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S IRREPARABLE.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.508
I THINK HE SOUNDS LIKE
HE GOT REALLY MAD, AND...

26:23.610 --> 26:25.123
- YEAH.
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

26:25.230 --> 26:27.539
AND HE NEEDED SOME TIME AWAY,
AND THAT MAKES SENSE.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.993
- I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S--

26:30.100 --> 26:31.510
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING.
I JUST--

- JULIA, PEOPLE HAVE THEIR
UPS AND DOWNS AND MAKE MISTAKES,

26:34.830 --> 26:37.276

THAT JOEL WON'T

26:37.380 --> 26:40.178
FORGIVE YOU AND UNDERSTAND.

26:40.280 --> 26:45.001
ALL YOU HAVE IS NOT GONNA GO
AWAY BECAUSE OF HALF A SECOND.

26:46.150 --> 26:48.971
- YEAH.
I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:49.090 --> 26:50.011
I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.736
I JUST DON'T WANT HIM
TO LEAVE ME.

26:52.850 --> 26:54.158

- WHO'S GONNA LEAVE YOU?

26:54.260 --> 26:56.433

27:35.510 --> 27:36.329

27:36.440 --> 27:39.614
AND THEY GOT
A MECHANICAL BULL.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.688
- OH, MY GOSH.
- [laughs] YEAH.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.918
'CAUSE YOU AND ME, YOU KNOW,
WE COULD GO OVER THERE

27:45.040 --> 27:48.077
AND DANCE AND RIDE THE BULL.
- MM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:48.180 --> 27:50.148
I THINK A MOVE IS A GOOD IDEA.

27:50.250 --> 27:54.357
IN FACT, I THINK I'M GONNA MOVE
DOWN TO THIS END OF THE BAR.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.906
AND YOU CAN STAY HERE...

THE BEST LIFE, OKAY?

28:02.920 --> 28:04.251
- COME ON, NOW.

28:04.370 --> 28:07.055
IT SEEMS LIKE
I BOUGHT YOU THREE DRINKS.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.333
- OH, YOU BOUGHT ME
THREE DRINKS?

28:09.440 --> 28:12.409
SO YOU THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE SEX WITH YOU?

28:12.510 --> 28:14.137
WOW.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.992
DO YOU THINK
I OWE YOU SOMETHING?

28:16.100 --> 28:17.067
- NO.

28:17.170 --> 28:18.853
- THINK WE'RE GONNA
FALL IN LOVE TONIGHT?

28:18.970 --> 28:21.029
- ALL I'M SAYING IS I THINK
WE'RE GETTING ALONG, YOU KNOW?

28:21.140 --> 28:23.244
- THINK WE'RE GETTING ALONG?
THIS IS WHAT GETTING ALONG IS?

28:23.350 --> 28:26.456
I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE LIKE
I'VE JUST BEEN SITTING HERE

LETTING YOU TALK AT ME
AND SAY A BUNCH OF STUPID CRAP

28:29.810 --> 28:33.018
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
FOR, LIKE, TWO HOURS.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.566
THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I'M GETTING
FROM THIS WHOLE SCENARIO.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.252
- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
A LITTLE BITCH, AREN'T YOU?

28:38.370 --> 28:40.679
- I'M A LITTLE BITCH?
I'M A LITTLE BITCH?

28:40.780 --> 28:42.338
- YEAH.
- I'M A LITTLE BITCH?

28:42.440 --> 28:43.668

28:46.750 --> 28:48.138
- JASON, CALM DOWN.
- THROW HER OUTTA HERE.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.719
- YEAH, JASON, CALM DOWN.
- AND YOU--I THINK IT'S TIME

28:49.830 --> 28:51.274
FOR YOU TO GO.
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

28:51.380 --> 28:53.132
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO'S HARASSING
EVERYBODY AT THE BAR!

28:53.240 --> 28:54.172
- AMBER!

28:55.450 --> 28:58.271
- YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?

28:58.390 --> 29:00.244
- YEAH, HE KNOWS ME.

29:00.350 --> 29:02.045
IT'S ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
I'M GONNA GO.

29:02.150 --> 29:04.835
YOU GUYS HAVE
A REALLY GOOD NIGHT.

29:04.950 --> 29:06.178
SHOULDN'T BE HERE ANYWAY.

29:06.290 --> 29:07.700
HEY, TAKE HER EASY,
WOULD YOU, JASON?

29:07.810 --> 29:09.869
GOOD LUCK, MAN.

29:14.300 --> 29:17.224
[sobbing]

29:20.240 --> 29:21.502
- HEY, AMBER.
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

29:21.620 --> 29:22.575
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

29:22.690 --> 29:24.510
- I'M TRYING TO
JUST GET TO MY CAR.

29:24.620 --> 29:26.656
JUST WANNA GO HOME.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.136
- YOU'RE NOT DRIVING.
YOU'RE DRUNK.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.686
- I'M FINE!
I'M NOT DRUNK! JUST STOP!

29:30.800 --> 29:32.939
I'M TRYING TO JUST GO HOME.
- GIMME THE KEYS.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.450
- STOP IT!
YOU DON'T KNOW

29:34.560 --> 29:37.211
ABOUT DRINKING AND DRIVING,
YOU STUPID ASSHOLE!

29:37.320 --> 29:40.141
- LOOK, NO MATTER WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT ME AS A FATHER,

29:40.260 --> 29:42.637
I AM NOT GONNA
LET YOU DRIVE DRUNK.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.219
- STOP IT!
IT'S REALLY IRONIC THAT

29:44.330 --> 29:46.946
YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT DRINKING AND DRIVING.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.391
JUST BACK OFF, OKAY,

29:53.030 --> 29:55.191
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF ME!

29:55.310 --> 29:57.687
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME, MAN!

29:57.790 --> 29:59.098
JUST--JUST BACK OFF!

29:59.210 --> 30:01.724

30:04.110 --> 30:06.032
THIS IS YOUR FAULT ANYWAY!

30:06.140 --> 30:07.960

HOW IS IT MY FAULT?

30:08.080 --> 30:09.240
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON!

30:09.350 --> 30:13.628
- IT'S YOUR FAULT! OKAY?
BECAUSE MY FIANCE LEI-T ME!

30:13.740 --> 30:17.801
AND I LOVED HIM,
AND NOW HE'S GONE, OKAY?

30:17.910 --> 30:19.389
- SO YOU'RE MAD AT ME
BECAUSE YOU THINK

30:19.500 --> 30:20.319
YOU'RE GONNA MARRY
SOMEBODY LIKE ME, RIGHT?

30:20.430 --> 30:23.911
- NO. NO, THAT'S NOT WHY!

30:24.020 --> 30:26.432
- WHY?
- IT'S BECAUSE--BECAUSE YOU'RE--

30:26.540 --> 30:30.715
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID I'M--

30:30.820 --> 30:33.539
I'M LIKE YOU!

30:33.650 --> 30:36.790
I'M AFRAID
I'M EXACTLY LIKE YOU,

30:36.900 --> 30:41.553
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
AT SOME STUPID BAR.

30:41.660 --> 30:44.629
[sobbing]

30:55.060 --> 30:58.268
- I WAS STANDING
IN THE PALAZZO COMUNALE

30:58.370 --> 31:01.919
IN MONTEPULCIANO
WHEN IT HIT ME...

31:02.030 --> 31:05.477
THE GRANDIOSITY OF THE WORLD.

31:08.590 --> 31:10.376
ITS SHEER BEAUTY...

31:10.480 --> 31:14.109
MAGNITUDE...
HOW LITTLE I KNOW OF IT.

31:14.210 --> 31:17.384
HOW MUCH I WANT TO KNOW.

31:17.490 --> 31:20.379
- YEAH, I DON'T--IT'S KIND OF
A CRAPSHOOT, THOUGH, ISN'T IT?

31:20.490 --> 31:23.186
I MEAN, YOU'RE STANDING THERE
IN ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL PLACES,

31:23.290 --> 31:24.939
AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME,

31:25.050 --> 31:26.460
YOU'RE MISSING AMBER'S BREAKUP

31:26.570 --> 31:29.368
AND, YOU KNOW,
KRISTINA'S ELECTION THING.

31:29.470 --> 31:32.018
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

31:32.130 --> 31:33.358
HOW'D SHE TAKE IT?

31:33.470 --> 31:34.778
HOW'D SHE TAKE THE LOSS?

31:34.890 --> 31:37.097
- WELL, SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN, SHE...

31:37.200 --> 31:39.373
SHE JUST
HANDLED IT WITH GRACE.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.640
- OF COURSE.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.954
- I MEAN,
SHE'S GONNA DO SOMETHING.

31:42.070 --> 31:43.822
- YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:43.930 --> 31:45.511
AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING
ABOUT GOING AWAY.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.417
YOU REALIZE THAT LIFE
JUST GOES ON WITHOUT YOU,

31:47.520 --> 31:48.657
YOU'RE NOT REALLY NEEDED.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.455
- OH, COME ON.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.859
HONEY, YOU ARE SO NEEDED.
- YEAH, WELL...

31:53.980 --> 31:57.495
- NO, I DON'T MEAN IT
IN A BAD WAY, IT'S...

31:57.600 --> 32:01.878
IT'S LIBERATING.
MEANS I CAN GO AWAY AGAIN.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.699
- AGAIN? YOU'RE GONNA--

32:04.810 --> 32:06.016
YOU'RE GOING AWAY AGAIN?

32:06.130 --> 32:07.461
- WELL, THE CLASS
IS TAKING A TRIP TO FRANCE

32:07.580 --> 32:10.128
IN THREE MONTHS IN APRIL.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.407
- THREE MONTHS?

32:14.510 --> 32:18.094
- [sighs] I KNOW THIS IS
A BIG CHANGE FOR US.

32:18.210 --> 32:20.542
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T
WANT TO SELL THE HOUSE.

32:20.660 --> 32:21.752
I REALLY DO.

32:21.870 --> 32:23.417
BUT I'M NOT READY
TO GIVE UP MY DREAM.

32:23.520 --> 32:27.001
I'M JUST NOT.

32:27.110 --> 32:30.694
BECAUSE IT'S MY DREAM.

32:30.810 --> 32:33.597
AND, UM, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
A LOT WHEN I WAS AWAY,

32:33.710 --> 32:38.226
AND I FIGURED OUT THAT IF
I WORK AT THE STUDIO PART TIME,

32:38.330 --> 32:41.390
I COULD PROBABLY
MAKE ABOUT $300 A WEEK,

32:41.510 --> 32:45.367
WHICH MEANS AT THE END
OF THREE MONTHS I WOULD HAVE

32:45.480 --> 32:48.051
ENOUGH TO COVER
MOST OF THE COST OF THE TRIP.

32:48.170 --> 32:51.333
- WELL, THAT--THAT IS--

32:51.450 --> 32:54.726
OKAY. WELL, YOU GOT IT
ALL FIGURED OUT.

32:54.830 --> 32:57.344
AND THAT'S GOOD.

32:57.450 --> 32:58.178

33:15.540 --> 33:18.839
YOU NEEDED TO KNOW
THAT AMBER'S UP HERE WITH ME.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.167
- WHAT?
WHAT IS SHE DOING THERE?

33:21.270 --> 33:22.919
- OH, GETTING OUT SOME ANGER
AT HER OLD MAN.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.578
- WELL, SHE HAD A BAD BREAKUP.

33:25.690 --> 33:28.443
- YEAH, SHE MENTIONED THAT.
- OKAY, I'LL--I'M ON THE WAY.

33:28.550 --> 33:29.756
- NO, NO, NO,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

33:29.860 --> 33:32.169
SHE'S--SHE'S SLEEPING.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.827
SHE WAS DEFINITELY UPSET
WHEN SHE GOT HERE,

33:33.940 --> 33:35.100
BUT SHE'S OKAY NOW.

33:35.220 --> 33:37.211
- SETH, HOW DID SHE EVEN
KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

33:37.320 --> 33:38.173
I DON'T HAVE YOUR ADDRESS.

33:38.290 --> 33:40.690
- SHE JUST SHOWED UP
AT MY WORK.

33:40.810 --> 33:44.280
LISTEN, I KNOW...

33:44.400 --> 33:47.984
MY TRACK RECORD
ISN'T EXACTLY STELLAR,

33:48.090 --> 33:48.636
AND I DON'T DESERVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY,

33:48.750 --> 33:50.775
BUT I'D LIKE TO TRY.

33:50.890 --> 33:51.640
- TRY WHAT?

33:51.750 --> 33:56.369
- BE HER DAD.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.926
- YEAH.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.167
DEFINITELY.

34:00.270 --> 34:03.967
JUST TELL HER TO CALL ME, OKAY?
AND YOU CALL ME.

34:04.070 --> 34:07.062
CALL ME TOMORROW
AND TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

WE'RE NOT PLAYING
WILD CARDS, RIGHT?

A REAL GAME, THOUGH.
