WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:06.139
Uh,what about
if I throw you

00:06.139 --> 00:08.141
a bowling party
for your birthday?

00:08.141 --> 00:09.543
A clambake on the beach?

00:09.543 --> 00:11.879
Ice skating
on the dark side of Pluto?

00:11.879 --> 00:14.915
No, no, and again... no.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.917
Okay, a sit-down dinner?

00:16.917 --> 00:17.985
A stand-up dinner?

00:17.985 --> 00:18.986
A lay-down brunch?

00:18.986 --> 00:20.754
Stop me when you hear
something you like.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.823
Sabrina, I do not
want a birthday party.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.291
I do not want one on the beach.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.626
I do not want one
with a Sneech.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.060
I do not want one up in space.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.863
I do not want one
anyplace!

00:29.863 --> 00:30.797
A party in Whoville?

00:30.797 --> 00:31.732
Oh!

00:31.732 --> 00:34.401
It's your 650th...
that's big.

00:34.401 --> 00:35.802
We have to do something.

00:35.802 --> 00:36.837
I agree.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.805
We have to get back to
work and never mention

00:38.805 --> 00:41.508
the word "birthday"
or "party" ever again.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.478
Did you hear her?

00:44.478 --> 00:47.347
No. I try and tune her
out as much as possible.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.782
I want to throw her
a birthday party

00:48.782 --> 00:50.183
but she said
she doesn't want one.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.385
Sure, she does.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.386
So when she says

00:52.386 --> 00:53.453
"never mention the word
'party' again"

00:53.453 --> 00:54.221
what she really means is

00:54.221 --> 00:56.189
"bring in da noise,
bring in da funk"?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.125
Sabrina, when someone says
they don't want a party

00:58.125 --> 00:59.793
it means they really
do want a party.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.329
-They just want it
to be a surprise.
-You think?

01:02.329 --> 01:04.831
Yeah, everyone
loves a surprise.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.272
Well, almost everyone.

01:16.510 --> 01:23.116
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:23.116 --> 01:28.755
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:28.755 --> 01:32.793
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:32.793 --> 01:36.530
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:38.365 --> 01:41.668
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:41.668 --> 01:46.273
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:53.380 --> 01:54.581
I finally found
another realm bakery

01:54.581 --> 01:56.316
that'll make
Hilda's favorite:

01:56.316 --> 01:58.018
angel food cake
with deviled ham.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.853
Sabrina,
you're wasting your time.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.755
I've thrown her hundreds
of parties over the years

02:01.755 --> 02:03.056
and she hated every one.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.791
She wasn't the only one.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.126
Boring!

02:06.126 --> 02:07.361
What do you know?

02:07.361 --> 02:08.495
I'll have you know

02:08.495 --> 02:09.997
people are still talking about

02:09.997 --> 02:11.665
that bash I threw for her 400th.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.700
Eight of the world's
most renowned astronomers

02:13.700 --> 02:16.970
pondering the universe
over a vegetable lasagna.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.240
They weren't pondering,
they were sleeping.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.309
Well, this party's
going to be great.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.677
I spent the whole weekend
rounding up

02:23.677 --> 02:24.811
all her friends from the past.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.213
I even went through
her address book.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.848
And I went through her drawers.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.216
Nothing going on there.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.784
I've invited
all of her girlfriends

02:30.784 --> 02:32.052
from The Other Realm High

02:32.052 --> 02:35.122
including the Future Hexmakers
of America and the Potionettes.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.224
"Eye of newt, rah, rah, rah...

02:37.224 --> 02:39.593
warts and strychnine,
blah, blah, blah..."

02:39.593 --> 02:42.029
I can't stand
those cackling hens.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.464
Oh, good,
the Gargoyles are coming.

02:44.464 --> 02:45.732
Have you heard
from the Griffins?

02:45.732 --> 02:46.767
Only Merv.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.934
He's trying to get
out of a dinner

02:47.934 --> 02:49.436
with Siegfried and Roy.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.139
Gosh, you invited
Sally O'Brien

02:52.139 --> 02:53.840
my old flame.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.876
I'll never understand
why she dumped me.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.110
You became a cat.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.112
Still.
You work with people.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.614
Will you be able
to get Aunt Hilda

03:00.614 --> 03:02.349
out of the universe
for a couple of hours

03:02.349 --> 03:03.383
so we can surprise her?

03:03.383 --> 03:05.052
Well, she has been
talking about

03:05.052 --> 03:07.054
this Mexican Restaurant
over on Orion's Belt.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.256
They say the chalupas
are out of this world.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.558
Hi. What you doing?

03:11.558 --> 03:12.626
Nothing.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.027
What's wrong?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.128
-Nothing.
-Nothing
-Nothing.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.830
It's my dress, isn't it?

03:16.830 --> 03:19.099
If you hate it,
why don't you just say so?

03:20.467 --> 03:21.735
Okay, I'll say it for you.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.271
"Hilda, I hate your dress;
go change."

03:24.271 --> 03:27.474
Fine, if you put it
like that, I will.

03:27.474 --> 03:31.845
Oddly enough, that's the one
dress of hers that I like.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.417
Hi. Hello.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.585
Hi. Thanks
for coming.

03:38.585 --> 03:39.920
Hilda will be here any minute.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.621
She's going to be
so excited to see you.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.223
Can I take your coat?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.624
Oh.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.329
Well, you seem pretty
reserved this evening.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.831
I thought you were
a party animal.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.100
I'm saving myself for Sally.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.235
Well, I think she's
right over there.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.538
Duh, I'll say she is!

03:58.538 --> 04:02.509
Va-va-va-voom!

04:02.509 --> 04:05.212
What's wrong, gorgeous,
cat got your tongue?

04:05.212 --> 04:06.413
Or do you just
wish he did?

04:06.413 --> 04:09.216
Salem Saberhagen.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.550
You rake.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.551
( <i>chuckles</i> )

04:11.551 --> 04:14.888
I also mow...
but we can talk
yard work later.

04:14.888 --> 04:15.889
( <i>chuckles</i> )

04:15.889 --> 04:18.225
Oh, the years have been
good to you, Sally.

04:18.225 --> 04:21.027
And you've got a little
hummus on your whiskers.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.764
You still give me
the goose bumps, fella.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.333
Mee-hee-hee-yeow.

04:26.333 --> 04:29.870
( <i>thunder crashing</i> )

04:29.870 --> 04:32.172
( <i>loudly</i> ):
Well, Hilda,
here we are

04:32.172 --> 04:33.774
back at the house.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.542
Zelda:
Duh, I'm not in a coma.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.511
Quick, everybody hide.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.714
I don't know what's in
those other realm tacos

04:40.714 --> 04:43.950
but, oh, they always
give me the worst...

04:43.950 --> 04:46.086
-Surprise!
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

04:46.086 --> 04:48.755
( <i>screams</i> )

04:48.755 --> 04:50.957
Remember how cute
Sir Galahad was?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.926
He was the best jouster
in senior class.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.796
If anyone would know,
you would.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.165
( <i>screaming laughter</i> )

04:58.165 --> 05:00.400
Oh, that noise...

05:00.400 --> 05:02.702
It's worse than nails
on a blackboard.

05:02.702 --> 05:03.703
Oh, I think it's great.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.138
I haven't seen
Aunt Hilda this happy

05:05.138 --> 05:07.040
since she went waterbed
shopping with Casanova.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.775
( <i>screaming laughter</i> )

05:08.775 --> 05:11.244
Hand me a couple
of those cheese balls.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.180
I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.214
I am.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.016
( <i>shrill laughter continues</i> )

05:16.016 --> 05:18.718
( <i>sighs</i> )

05:18.718 --> 05:21.822
Sabrina, have you had
a chance to meet everybody?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.824
This is Roz
and her son Barry.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.825
Hello.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.893
This is Eleanor
and her daughter Grace.

05:26.893 --> 05:30.463
Isn't she adorable?

05:30.463 --> 05:33.099
And this is my old college
roommate Tess

05:33.099 --> 05:34.801
and her son Bobo.

05:34.801 --> 05:38.305
Zelda, you have
cheese in your ears.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.273
What are you thinking?

05:40.273 --> 05:43.176
These are
for the guests.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.344
I think
it's so great

05:44.344 --> 05:45.745
you all brought
your kids.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.315
Oh, can you believe
we're all moms?

05:48.315 --> 05:49.749
Except for Hilda.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.218
I'm not ready
to have children.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.753
Right now I'm just dating
guys that act like them.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.489
Hilda's priority
is her career.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.991
That's right,
she's an entrepreneur

05:57.991 --> 06:00.126
a very high-level
beverage broker.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.028
Yes, I heard
you bought a coffee shop.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.263
It's a coffeehouse.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.198
Right now I'm focusing
all my energy

06:05.198 --> 06:06.566
on getting it off the grounds.

06:06.566 --> 06:07.567
( <i>laughs</i> )

06:07.567 --> 06:08.668
Oh, honey, besides

06:08.668 --> 06:11.304
you never needed kids
to give your life validation.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.839
That's what we
admire about you.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.575
Thank you.
I admire that about me, too.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.710
What an inspiration.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.379
You're secure enough
to live the rest of your life

06:19.379 --> 06:20.714
with your spinster sister

06:20.714 --> 06:22.549
and not even
be bothered by it.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.952
Yep, really missing
these people.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.889
Okay, who ate
all the cheese balls?

06:32.292 --> 06:34.027
Thanks for the party,
Sabrina.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.061
It was fantastic.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.529
Tell me
about it.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.733
Sally was all over me
like a cheap suit.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.668
Not unlike the one I'm wearing.

06:41.668 --> 06:44.571
Well, I must admit, that
despite the food, the guests

06:44.571 --> 06:47.240
and a gift from Bobo
in the laundry room

06:47.240 --> 06:48.875
the party wasn't half bad.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.176
Well, thanks, Aunt Zelda.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.845
If this college thing
doesn't work out

06:51.845 --> 06:53.914
I might go into
the party planning business.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.849
I think I have knack
for making people happy.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.918
( <i>crying</i> ):
I wish I were dead!

06:57.918 --> 07:00.320
Oh, dear,
perhaps the party

07:00.320 --> 07:02.188
triggered a lot of
deep-seated feelings.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.591
You haven't seen those hens,
I mean, friends

07:04.591 --> 07:07.227
for over 400 years,
and now they're gone.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.628
You think that's it?

07:08.628 --> 07:09.763
Well, it could be.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.631
Plus, big birthdays
are always emotional.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.334
I mean, when I turned two,
I remember I cried like a baby.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.536
Wait, I was a baby.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.438
All you need is
a good night's sleep.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.707
And a case of tissues.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.841
( <i>sniffing</i> )

07:21.841 --> 07:24.544
Ooh. I smell monkey.

07:29.015 --> 07:32.786
( <i>crying</i> )

07:32.786 --> 07:34.621
Aunt Hilda, I thought
you went upstairs.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.023
I can't sleep.
I'm buzzing.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.292
Oh, it must be
all the excitement
from the party, huh?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.361
No. I'm literally buzzing.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.529
Listen to this.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.763
( <i>buzzing</i> )

07:43.763 --> 07:45.098
What do you think it is?

07:45.098 --> 07:46.933
Did you swallow
the oven timer again?

07:46.933 --> 07:49.669
You are never going
to let that go, are you?

07:49.669 --> 07:51.071
Okay, that's not good

07:51.071 --> 07:52.405
and it's definitely
not mortal.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.274
We got to get you to
another realm doctor.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.642
I hate doctors.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.144
They're always poking you
and asking if it hurts.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.780
Of course, it hurts.
You just poked me!

08:00.780 --> 08:01.948
( <i>buzzing</i> )

08:01.948 --> 08:05.785
Ooh, knock it off!

08:05.785 --> 08:07.020
MAN ( <i>over P.A.):</i>
Dr. Korn, please call
Radiology.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.989
Dr. Korn, please call radiology.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.890
What is taking so long?

08:10.890 --> 08:13.059
Hilda's been
in that exam room forever.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.661
She's been in there
five minutes.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.196
Why are you so nervous?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.697
Well, she's my sister.

08:17.697 --> 08:20.934
Sure, she may drive me crazy,
have obnoxious friends...

08:20.934 --> 08:26.039
be a little flaky, loud,
overbearing, a complete slob...

08:26.039 --> 08:27.574
What was I trying to say?

08:27.574 --> 08:29.009
How much you care
about Aunt Hilda.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.944
I love that woman.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.112
( <i>buzzing</i> )

08:32.112 --> 08:33.346
Uh-huh.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.816
Oh-ho.

08:36.816 --> 08:37.884
Well?

08:37.884 --> 08:38.918
What do I have?

08:38.918 --> 08:39.919
Rickets?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.554
Ringworm? Tapeworm?

08:41.554 --> 08:42.889
Smallpox? Largepox?

08:42.889 --> 08:44.391
Mumps? Bumps?

08:44.391 --> 08:47.227
Hypo-menosynchronism, Type 2.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.728
I went to
clown college, okay?

08:48.728 --> 08:51.131
Break it down for me.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.668
Wow!

08:55.668 --> 08:57.037
You'd think you'd remember

08:57.037 --> 08:58.571
swallowing
a thing like that.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.306
Oh, you didn't swallow this.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.042
This is your biological clock.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.744
Ooh, and it's running
a little fast.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.913
Has anything unusual
happened recently?

09:06.913 --> 09:09.582
No. I've just been
going to work.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.485
My niece just threw me
this fantastic birthday

09:12.485 --> 09:15.588
where all my old friends
showed up with their kids.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.624
( <i>crying</i> )

09:17.624 --> 09:20.260
Oh, that's it.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.162
Your biological clock
is telling you

09:22.162 --> 09:23.730
you want to have a baby.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.832
But I'm not ready
to have a baby.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.600
I don't have a husband.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.402
I don't have a boyfriend.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.971
I don't even
have a test tube.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.139
I understand.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.774
Why don't you leave
your clock with me.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.043
I'll recalibrate it
and get you some more time.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.678
God, I love being a witch.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.448
You can pick it up
tomorrow afternoon.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.615
Unless you have an HMO

09:42.615 --> 09:44.117
then we're talking
about next year.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.052
Don't worry, I have
Broom Cross/Broom Shield.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.253
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.421
Oh, one other thing.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.490
You might find
that without your clock

09:50.490 --> 09:52.625
you have a few
mood swings.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.527
I mean, you might act
a little loony.

09:54.527 --> 09:57.630
Trust me, no one will
notice the difference.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.566
Does our family
have any history

09:59.566 --> 10:00.767
of abnormal levitation?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.435
Well, during the '60s

10:02.435 --> 10:05.271
but everybody was
floating higher then.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.806
Oh, finally.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.641
What did he say?

10:08.641 --> 10:10.510
My biological clock
is out of whack.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.911
I left it here
to get adjusted.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.279
Will you be all right
without it?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.280
Of course I will.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.515
I just may experience some...

10:15.515 --> 10:17.517
irrational moments!

10:17.517 --> 10:20.587
But then I'll be fine.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.557
Excuse me. Could
I get a refill?

10:24.557 --> 10:26.759
No. Finish
what you've got.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.428
It's cold.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.230
Swallow it, or be flogged!

10:30.230 --> 10:32.232
Okay, I'm out of here.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.968
Thanks for coming.
Tell your friends.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.137
Hilda, are you okay?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.706
You seem a little...
moodier than usual.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.941
Everything's fine, but
I appreciate your concern.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.444
Or is it concern?

10:44.444 --> 10:46.412
Perhaps you're hoping
that I'll croak

10:46.412 --> 10:48.681
so you can take over
the coffeehouse.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.350
Do you need
a refill, honey?

10:52.218 --> 10:53.486
What does a nervous breakdown
look like?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.755
Oh, Aunt Hilda's not
having a nervous breakdown.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.056
She's having...

10:57.056 --> 10:58.124
mechanical difficulties.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.225
Yeah, I'll say.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.461
She's got more loose screws
than Home Depot.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.996
If I don't get
that clock back today

11:02.996 --> 11:04.964
I am gonna off somebody!

11:04.964 --> 11:07.200
Okay, maybe she is.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.736
Aunt Hilda...
hey, why don't I
go by the hospital

11:09.736 --> 11:12.238
and see if your clock's
ready to be picked up.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.773
Why?! You think
I can't handle it?

11:13.773 --> 11:15.108
No, not at all.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.643
Hide the sharp utensils.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.278
Drive safe, honey.

11:20.446 --> 11:23.249
Hi. I'm here to pick up
a package for Hilda Spellman.

11:23.249 --> 11:24.651
I have a lot
of packages.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.119
Do you have
a claim check?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.021
Sorry. She forgot
to give me one.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.023
She's been majorly
nutso all week.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.325
Mm-hmm, biological clock.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.526
I got it right here.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.128
Careful, it's wet.

11:35.128 --> 11:39.365
Thanks. I'm grateful and
grossed out at the same time.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.334
Hey, where's my aunt?

11:41.334 --> 11:42.335
She went home...

11:42.335 --> 11:44.170
two seconds before
all of Boston showed up.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.838
Okay, I've just got
to get this to her.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.040
I'll be back
in ten minutes.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.675
Wait, Sabrina,
before you go,
could you

11:48.675 --> 11:50.009
take these over
to Table Four?

11:50.009 --> 11:51.010
Sure.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.078
Thanks. you're
a lifesaver.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.822
Dental floss, a hairbrush

12:02.822 --> 12:04.691
a Jacqueline Susann novel?

12:04.691 --> 12:05.792
Oh, my gosh!

12:05.792 --> 12:08.628
Somebody took my Aunt Hilda's
biological clock!

12:14.167 --> 12:16.002
This is a nightmare;
one of the worst things

12:16.002 --> 12:17.203
that has ever, ever happened!

12:17.203 --> 12:18.037
What happened?

12:18.037 --> 12:19.505
Somebody stole
my aunt's clock.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.507
Okay, people, I
need your attention.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.842
We have a crisis...

12:22.842 --> 12:24.711
an emergency
situation.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.879
A clock has been lost!

12:26.879 --> 12:28.748
( <i>laughter</i> )

12:28.748 --> 12:32.318
Josh, have you seen anybody
with a bag that looks like this?

12:32.318 --> 12:33.753
A half dozen people,
but I don't see

12:33.753 --> 12:35.421
what the big deal is;
it's just a clock.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.756
You don't understand.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.925
That clock is a big part
of my Aunt Hilda's life.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.793
In fact, it's a big part
of my Aunt Hilda.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.395
Got to go.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.468
Oh, thank goodness,
you're home.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.936
What happened to your head?

12:49.936 --> 12:50.937
Hilda bit me.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.539
It was my fault, though.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.375
I said hello to her
when she walked in.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.542
Hilda's been
acting insane

12:56.542 --> 12:58.311
since they took out that clock.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.512
Please, tell me that's it.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.780
It'd better be.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.815
I've lost enough blood.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.250
Uh, about the clock...

13:04.250 --> 13:05.985
Don't tell me
you don't have it.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.253
Okay.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.955
Yuck! I've been
gargling for an hour

13:08.955 --> 13:10.790
and I can still taste cat.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.958
( <i>gasps</i> )

13:11.958 --> 13:13.626
My clock is home!
My clock is home!

13:13.626 --> 13:15.128
Let's have a clock party.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.130
( <i>lively music plays</i> )

13:17.130 --> 13:18.364
Bag, please.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.768
( <i>music stops</i> )

13:21.768 --> 13:23.169
<i>Valley of the Dolls?</i>

13:23.169 --> 13:26.072
A timeless classic,
not unlike the hairbrush.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.540
Where's my clock?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.642
Well, it's kind of
a funny story.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.944
See, um,
someone walked off with it.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.780
SALEM:
Lord, have mercy!

13:33.780 --> 13:35.882
A stranger is walking
around town

13:35.882 --> 13:37.617
with my biological clock?!

13:37.617 --> 13:40.086
Okay, maybe it's not so funny,
but, um, you know what?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.654
I'll get you a new one,
I promise.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.057
Where? At the
biological clock store?

13:44.057 --> 13:45.958
Is there one?

13:45.958 --> 13:48.394
Sabrina, a witch is only issued
one biological clock.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.863
If she loses it, it can
have serious ramifications.

13:50.863 --> 13:51.864
That's right.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.166
What are they?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.435
She has to find a man
and get pregnant

13:55.435 --> 13:56.703
in the next 48 hours

13:56.703 --> 13:59.439
or she'll never be able
to conceive a child.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.840
Oh, my God!

14:00.840 --> 14:01.908
I'm so sorry, Aunt Hilda.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.409
Just because of me,
you might end up

14:03.409 --> 14:05.378
childless and miserable
the rest of your life!

14:05.378 --> 14:06.512
( <i>whining</i> )

14:06.512 --> 14:08.047
Oh, way to cheer her up.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.849
I suggest you find that bag.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.517
Forget the bag!

14:11.517 --> 14:12.752
Help me find a man!

14:12.752 --> 14:16.255
I need a bun in the oven,
and I need it <i>now!</i>

14:16.889 --> 14:19.058
...and when I walked
back over here

14:19.058 --> 14:20.626
my aunt's clock was gone.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.895
All right, let me
get this straight.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.732
I just left a triple homicide
to look for some lady's clock?

14:25.732 --> 14:27.066
It's not just <i>any</i> clock.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.634
It's very... unique.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.036
What's it do, sing a song?

14:30.036 --> 14:31.537
"Take Me Out
to the Ball Game," maybe?

14:31.537 --> 14:32.905
( <i>sighs</i> )

14:32.905 --> 14:35.108
Look, my aunt's just
very attached to it, okay?

14:35.108 --> 14:36.275
Oh, got you.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.910
I'll put every precinct on it.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.612
I'll call in
the national guard.

14:39.612 --> 14:43.316
We'll call it
"Clockwatch: 2001."

14:43.316 --> 14:44.417
You know, I get
the impression

14:44.417 --> 14:45.985
you're not taking this
seriously.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.287
You're a very perceptive
young lady.

14:48.287 --> 14:49.889
Also make a nice corn muffin.

14:49.889 --> 14:55.461
Thanks.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.729
So, what I'm asking you is

14:56.729 --> 14:59.265
did anyone come in and buy
a hairbrush, dental floss

14:59.265 --> 15:00.233
and a Jacqueline Susann novel?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.100
Yes.

15:01.100 --> 15:01.834
Great. Who?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.035
Well, about
a hundred people.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.104
They're on special
this week.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.812
Oh, my!

15:12.812 --> 15:16.416
The things that go on
in that valley.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.217
Well, Hilda,
you look beautiful.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.219
Well, if I want
to meet a man,
get married

15:20.219 --> 15:21.988
and have a baby
in the next two days

15:21.988 --> 15:23.322
I have to
look my best.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.992
Hilda, you've been trying
to find a man for 600 years.

15:25.992 --> 15:26.356
What makes you think

15:26.356 --> 15:27.927
you're going to find one
in two days?

15:27.927 --> 15:28.561
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

15:28.561 --> 15:30.696
I zapped an ad
in the newspaper.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.465
There's my husband-to-be.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.768
Come on in, boys.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.803
Take a number.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.305
Hilda!

15:39.305 --> 15:41.474
You obviously weren't
very specific.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.444
Well, maybe I shouldn't have
put in "marriage or best offer."

15:44.444 --> 15:45.111
( <i>chiming</i> )

15:45.111 --> 15:46.479
Oh, there's
the linen closet.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.414
I also put an ad
in the <i>Other Realm Register.</i>

15:48.414 --> 15:49.849
Coming, sweethearts.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.655
So, Eugene, why
are you interested

15:55.655 --> 15:58.191
in filling the position
of my husband?

15:58.191 --> 16:00.726
I figured it was time
to settle down.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.029
I've been having too much fun.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.797
Well, that's obvious.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.201
I've had a rich and exciting
life as a pharmacist--

16:08.201 --> 16:11.838
filling prescriptions
and whatnot.

16:11.838 --> 16:15.408
Time to fill the void
in my life.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.243
"Void."

16:17.243 --> 16:19.479
Okay. Anything else
I should know?

16:19.479 --> 16:23.316
I like to make people laugh.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.984
And how exactly
do you do that?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.420
Oh, I give them something
to smile about.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.454
Which would be...?

16:28.454 --> 16:31.190
Anything to put a grin
on their face

16:31.190 --> 16:33.392
and make a happy expression.

16:33.392 --> 16:34.794
Such as...?

16:34.794 --> 16:36.996
An amusing comment, uh, uh

16:36.996 --> 16:39.332
to tickle their funny bone.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.666
Okay, we're done.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.001
Thanks for coming.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.469
( <i>sighs</i> )

16:43.469 --> 16:44.971
All right, who's next?

16:44.971 --> 16:46.472
That's it.

16:46.472 --> 16:47.740
What are you
talking about?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.709
The last time I looked,
there were at least

16:49.709 --> 16:51.777
20 schmoes out here
who could have been
my soul mate.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.179
I sent every one of them home.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.014
What you're doing
is completely absurd.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.317
Sister, I have not
even touched the
tip of the iceberg.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.519
Congratulations.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.654
Despite your flair
for humor

17:01.654 --> 17:02.889
we're engaged.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.624
You're kidding!

17:04.624 --> 17:05.758
Only by your standards.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.193
All right, let's
have children.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.961
We're having them;
end of discussion.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.763
-Hilda!
-I feel the same way.

17:10.763 --> 17:11.931
I'm telling you

17:11.931 --> 17:13.699
we're going to have
one lucky baby.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.967
You know why?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.702
'Cause that kid's going
to have a daddy

17:16.702 --> 17:18.037
who wants to make him laugh.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.305
I'd ask why I'm
not laughing

17:19.305 --> 17:20.306
but I have no time.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.641
All right, I love you.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.376
Let's get the license
and a preacher.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.678
Hilda, you can't
marry this man.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.179
He's a total stranger.

17:27.179 --> 17:31.450
For all you know, he's
a... a professional gigolo.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.685
I'll take my chances.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.686
Don't mind her.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.687
She's just jealous.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.855
'Course she's jealous.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.189
You know why?

17:37.189 --> 17:40.459
She doesn't have a man
to bring hilarity to her life.

17:40.459 --> 17:43.229
You must want a
baby really bad.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.866
Man, oh, man, I must
have gone through

17:46.866 --> 17:48.734
over a hundred receipts
of that drugstore

17:48.734 --> 17:51.070
trying to track down
anyone who bought
a hairbrush

17:51.070 --> 17:52.672
dental floss,
and a cheesy novel.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.606
Find anything?

17:53.606 --> 17:54.607
Yeah, Judith Krantz--

17:54.607 --> 17:55.808
hotter than ever.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.009
Nobody put
their phone numbers down

17:57.009 --> 17:58.110
on their credit card receipts.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.745
How am I going
to find that clock?

18:00.813 --> 18:02.148
Sabrina!

18:02.148 --> 18:04.350
You'll never guess
what your aunt's about to do.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.885
Five bucks says it
involves a clock.

18:05.885 --> 18:06.886
She's getting married.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.187
Right now,
at City Hall.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.022
Oh, no, I got to find
that clock!

18:10.022 --> 18:12.358
Either that or a
large sack of rice.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.462
Hold on. I know
those vows are
in here somewhere.

18:16.462 --> 18:17.530
Take your time.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.131
You've got 50 seconds.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.833
So, how many children
do you want?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.702
Three.
One of each.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.770
( <i>men laughing</i> )

18:24.770 --> 18:26.572
Told you I like to
make people laugh.

18:26.572 --> 18:27.974
40 seconds.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.542
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered..."

18:29.542 --> 18:31.277
Skip that part.
We know the back story.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.278
"Do you...?"

18:32.278 --> 18:33.212
Hilda Spellman.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.547
Thank you.
"...take...?"

18:34.547 --> 18:36.082
Eugene Luffersweiler.

18:36.082 --> 18:39.552
Are you serious?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.753
Go on.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.088
"...to be your
lawfully wedded

18:42.088 --> 18:42.888
husband, to have
and to hold...?"
-I do.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.056
Don't you dare!

18:44.056 --> 18:46.459
Hello. Trying to engage
in holy matrimony here.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.461
Judge, you cannot marry
these two people.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.931
They-they don't even know
each other.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.467
Oh, I'm not a judge,
I'm a clerk.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.935
I'd like to be a judge though.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.403
SABRINA:
Did you hear
what she said?

18:57.403 --> 18:59.739
You're about to marry two people
who don't even know each other.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.073
Is that true?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.341
Yes. Okay, it's true.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.944
I decided to take the plunge
with a stranger

19:04.944 --> 19:07.213
whose last name
I can't even pronounce.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.649
The truth is,
I'm tired of waiting around

19:09.649 --> 19:11.450
for my knight in shining armor

19:11.450 --> 19:13.719
who apparently has
other things to do.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.054
Well, guess what?!

19:15.054 --> 19:16.389
So do I!

19:16.389 --> 19:18.391
Like, live my life,
start a family

19:18.391 --> 19:21.694
try to create
a little happiness for myself.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.496
So, Eugene and
I haven't talked

19:23.496 --> 19:25.931
about where we grew up
or went to college

19:25.931 --> 19:27.266
or how difficult it is

19:27.266 --> 19:28.868
to get an actual
human being

19:28.868 --> 19:30.469
on the line
at Ticketmaster.

19:30.469 --> 19:35.041
But I know in my
heart that Eugene
is a decent person

19:35.041 --> 19:37.877
while probably not perfect

19:37.877 --> 19:40.613
is at least... alive

19:40.613 --> 19:43.382
and that is good
enough for me.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.051
Wow!

19:45.051 --> 19:47.420
I never knew
you felt that way about me.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.455
Aunt Hilda...

19:49.455 --> 19:51.791
I love you too much
to let you rush into something

19:51.791 --> 19:53.859
especially something
as important as marriage

19:53.859 --> 19:55.027
and having a baby.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.295
You should have
all the time in the world

19:56.295 --> 19:58.531
to find the right guy, so...

19:58.531 --> 20:00.599
that's why I'm going
to give you my clock.

20:00.599 --> 20:01.967
Oh, Sabrina.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.335
I can't let you do that.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.271
Please? You have to.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.073
Sabrina, if I
take your clock

20:07.073 --> 20:09.842
then you'll never be
able to have children.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.677
Boy, that must
be some clock.

20:11.677 --> 20:14.613
Oh, but they're doing wonderful
things with science today.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.450
Eugene, I'm sorry,
but in light of what's happened

20:17.450 --> 20:19.552
I can't go through
with the ceremony.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.220
Hilda!

20:21.220 --> 20:22.521
This is so unlike you!

20:22.521 --> 20:23.989
I'm just guessing.

20:23.989 --> 20:25.157
You'll be fine.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.759
You'll make another woman laugh.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.028
Oh, I like to
make people laugh.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.330
Well, then, for God's sake,
just do it!

20:31.330 --> 20:32.965
Sabrina,
guess what I found.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.300
( <i>gasping</i> ):
The clock!

20:34.300 --> 20:35.301
None other.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.369
Where on earth
did it turn up?

20:37.369 --> 20:38.604
The coffeehouse.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.006
The person who accidentally
took it brought it back.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.943
She must have spilled something
on it 'cause it's a little wet.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.111
Smells like a chalupa.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.112
Thank you.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.413
I believe
this belongs to me.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.015
See you.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.952
Oddly enough, this isn't
the first time I've been left

20:52.952 --> 20:54.186
for a small appliance.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.321
( <i>chuckling</i> )

20:55.321 --> 20:56.989
You really are funny.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.125
That wasn't a joke.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.932
( <i>Salem moaning</i> )

21:06.932 --> 21:08.768
Uh, uh, oh, hi, Hildy.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.203
You remember Sally O'Brien?

21:11.203 --> 21:13.606
My friend Sally
now has whiskers and a tail?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.508
Salem couldn't turn
into a person

21:15.508 --> 21:16.842
so I met him halfway.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.511
Sally, I can't
believe you would

21:18.511 --> 21:19.812
turn yourself
into a cat.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.714
What could she possibly see
in you?

21:21.714 --> 21:24.016
"I like to make
people laugh."

21:24.016 --> 21:25.684
I know <i>I'm</i> laughing.

21:25.684 --> 21:26.852
Put me down!

21:26.852 --> 21:29.555
Sally and I have
tickets to <i>Cats.</i>

21:29.555 --> 21:30.389
( <i>door opens, rattling</i> )
