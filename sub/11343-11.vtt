WEBVTT

00:01.057 --> 00:03.412
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.457 --> 00:06.893
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.937 --> 00:10.896
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.937 --> 00:14.452
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.497 --> 00:16.533
'These are their stories.'

00:17.937 --> 00:20.735
- What have we got?
- Dead victim, head bashed in,

00:20.777 --> 00:23.655
privates exposed.
Tech found seminal fluid

00:23.697 --> 00:26.370
on the face, legs and mouth,
and we thought of you.

00:26.417 --> 00:29.090
- Was she a resident of the building?
- He.

00:34.097 --> 00:37.134
We've ID'd him as Seth Langdon.
He lived on the sixth floor.

00:37.177 --> 00:40.726
Nice two-bedroom, but he lived alone,
far as we can tell.

00:40.777 --> 00:43.086
Looks like this is where it went down.

00:43.137 --> 00:44.889
This guy didn't die quietly.

00:44.937 --> 00:47.576
Somebody must have heard something.

00:47.617 --> 00:49.767
They did. There was a loud party in 3B.

00:49.817 --> 00:53.253
- Pretty ironic ending, huh?
- Why's that?

00:53.297 --> 00:57.210
Him being Seth Langdon and all.
Son of William H Langdon.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.851
Head of the Moral Coalition?

00:59.897 --> 01:03.936
Yeah. Goes around preaching wholesome
living, homosexuality can be cured.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.535
That's one way to fix'em.

- What's going on?
- Here, John.

02:00.217 --> 02:03.687
- What's this?
- Union found us better insurance.

02:03.737 --> 02:06.126
This form is longer than the last book I read.

02:06.177 --> 02:09.089
- Don't you see what they're doing?
- Looking out for you.

02:09.137 --> 02:11.605
Psychiatric coverage
increased to 80 percent.

02:11.657 --> 02:14.012
- Relax. It's just a medical form.
- Right.

02:14.057 --> 02:18.050
They find your mother had diabetes or
your father male-pattern baldness...

02:18.097 --> 02:21.487
Sorry, Chief...
They'll have your genetic fingerprint.

02:21.537 --> 02:25.610
They'll know when you'll die, how
and what song you want at your funeral.

02:25.657 --> 02:27.852
Er, there's two Rs in haemorrhoids.

02:28.737 --> 02:31.809
- I'm a desk jockey. What can I do?
- She's got the right idea.

02:31.857 --> 02:34.291
Leave the father's side blank.
Mess 'em up.

02:34.337 --> 02:36.214
Let's keep our eyes on our own paper.

02:36.257 --> 02:39.374
OK, talk to me about
our rooftop homicide, people.

02:39.417 --> 02:42.489
Name's Seth Langdon. White male, 21.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.370
He was at a party
on the third floor of his building.

02:45.417 --> 02:47.726
Made his way to the roof around 1:00am.

02:47.777 --> 02:49.529
Seminal fluid on the victim.

02:49.577 --> 02:53.013
We're assuming pre-mortem.
Genitals left exposed.

02:53.057 --> 02:57.175
Beat up good. Culminated in his head
being bashed against the AC unit.

02:57.217 --> 02:59.651
- Lovers' quarrel.
- Sexual predator.

02:59.697 --> 03:03.133
Two types of seminal fluid,
one the victim's...

03:03.177 --> 03:07.853
The other the doer's? Start with the host,
work through the guests.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.535
Langdon?

03:09.577 --> 03:14.856
I read a piece on William Langdon,
saying how homosexuals can be cured.

03:14.897 --> 03:17.570
- The victim was his son.
- Get outta here.

03:17.617 --> 03:22.088
One in ten men is gay. How'd Langdon
feel about that hitting home?

03:28.057 --> 03:31.766
- No barbs about Benson's father.
- Excuse me?

03:31.817 --> 03:35.127
- You don't know the history there?
- No. Was he an alcoholic?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.694
Deadbeat dad, Jehovah's Witness?

03:38.737 --> 03:42.013
All she knows is he was the man
who raped her mother.

03:48.497 --> 03:51.534
Excuse me. Who are you?
How did you get by reception?

03:51.577 --> 03:54.569
Detectives Benson and Stabler
to see William Langdon.

03:54.617 --> 03:58.929
- Mr Langdon's not seeing anyone.
- We're not here selling Amway.

03:59.937 --> 04:03.213
It's all right, Steven. You can let them in.

04:06.457 --> 04:10.006
Do you have any idea
who might wanna do this to your son?

04:10.057 --> 04:11.376
No.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.171
Was he involved with anyone?
Did he have a boyfriend?

04:15.217 --> 04:19.369
- Or boyfriends?
- My son was not a homosexual.

04:19.416 --> 04:23.092
Sir, you are aware of the
circumstances of your son's death?

04:24.897 --> 04:28.572
Seth was merely... going through
a rebellious phase.

04:28.617 --> 04:31.256
All children do. We had it under control.

04:31.297 --> 04:35.290
How do you control
a person's natural sexual orientation?

04:35.337 --> 04:38.966
Homosexuality is not natural.
It is a crime against God.

04:39.017 --> 04:42.930
- And AIDS is divine retribution?
- Are you being flippant with me?

04:42.977 --> 04:48.176
We're just trying to find your son's killer.
It's our only agenda.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.134
Seth was so confused.

04:55.057 --> 04:57.366
I did everything I could to help him.

04:59.137 --> 05:02.925
Got him into one of those
sexual-rehabilitation centres.

05:02.977 --> 05:05.969
They have an excellent success rate.

05:08.177 --> 05:11.852
Seth completed the programme
two months ago.

05:11.897 --> 05:15.128
- Meaning he was cured?
- Yes.

05:16.977 --> 05:19.047
The party got out of hand?

05:19.097 --> 05:24.125
I see. You hear 'gay' and 'party'
and naturally you think S&M orgy?

05:24.177 --> 05:27.613
No, but the last party I went to
everybody made it home alive.

05:27.657 --> 05:29.648
The vic's blood-alcohol was 0.15.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.416
If you were a bartender
you'd be responsible.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.255
I haven't tended bar since Studio 54 closed.

05:35.897 --> 05:39.890
Think. Did anybody for any reason
stand out in one way or another?

05:39.937 --> 05:44.169
If they didn't they wouldn't get in.
Our guests were very prominent men.

05:44.217 --> 05:47.289
We'll still need names and addresses.

05:47.337 --> 05:49.931
- How well did you know Seth?
- He just moved in.

05:49.977 --> 05:53.253
Guess we saw him a few times
in the building's gym.

05:53.297 --> 05:57.290
He was a nice kid.
Still finding himself, so much turmoil.

05:57.337 --> 05:59.726
Seth hook up with anybody at this party?

05:59.777 --> 06:04.373
On the contrary, he unhooked...
from the blond man he walked in with.

06:04.417 --> 06:07.648
- This man have a name?
- He didn't stay for us to hear it.

06:07.697 --> 06:11.406
Seth got flirtatious,
his friend got upset and insisted they leave.

06:11.457 --> 06:14.255
Next we know,
they're exchanging words in the hall.

06:14.297 --> 06:17.733
- They leave together?
- No. Seth came back in by himself.

06:17.777 --> 06:22.134
He grabbed a beer and headed
for the balcony to cool down.

06:22.177 --> 06:27.695
What happened to him was outside
our world. It was a civilised gathering.

06:27.737 --> 06:31.696
'Stay out of my life!'
Then a bottle smashes outside our window.

06:31.737 --> 06:34.205
- Is this your apartment?
- The ground floor.

06:34.257 --> 06:37.294
It's the only way we can afford this building.

06:37.337 --> 06:41.330
I also do light maintenance
and my husband's the weekend super.

06:41.377 --> 06:44.767
These are the detectives
investigating that man's murder.

06:44.817 --> 06:47.206
I can't believe it happened.

06:47.257 --> 06:50.772
- How do you find the parties in 3B?
- Normally they're quiet.

06:50.817 --> 06:54.605
Except last night we had
three complaints about the music.

06:54.657 --> 06:56.852
Finally Jesse had to go up.

06:56.897 --> 07:00.253
- What time was that?
- Er, around... one.

07:00.297 --> 07:02.288
Did you see him?

07:02.337 --> 07:05.852
No, I didn't go in.
I just asked them to turn it down.

07:05.897 --> 07:08.889
When you heard the bottle smash,
you look out?

07:08.937 --> 07:11.053
- Yes.
- What did you see?

07:11.097 --> 07:15.568
Er... a blond guy getting into
a Lincoln Town Car.

07:15.617 --> 07:18.336
You know, the chauffeur-driven type?

07:19.657 --> 07:23.650
- Anything come up on the guests?
- I just started inputting them.

07:26.377 --> 07:28.845
- What?
- That father comment I made...

07:28.897 --> 07:32.936
- I didn't know he was, you know...
- A rapist.

07:32.977 --> 07:34.808
I know.

07:35.657 --> 07:38.854
Listen, Cragen and Stabler know.
Otherwise...

07:38.897 --> 07:40.888
- Got it.
- Thanks.

07:40.937 --> 07:42.734
- Ever catch the guy?
- Nope.

07:42.777 --> 07:45.849
- Were there any leads at the time?
- Nope.

07:46.897 --> 07:49.855
You ever need to talk to anybody, I'm here.

07:51.257 --> 07:54.488
- OK.
- Hey. We got the car service.

07:54.537 --> 08:00.453
The man they collected was driven
to the Upper East Side. Steven Hale.

08:01.457 --> 08:02.936
Good.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.695
What are you doing here?

08:14.737 --> 08:17.774
- Your boss had no idea, did he?
- About what?

08:17.817 --> 08:19.728
What you did to his son.

08:19.777 --> 08:22.530
Daddy! Let's go!

08:33.616 --> 08:37.735
Why would a gay man work for Langdon,
one of our most conservative bigots?

08:37.777 --> 08:40.655
Hale's not exactly open about his sexuality.

08:41.136 --> 08:45.016
Hale's wife and kid think he has
an uncanny ability to accessorise?

08:45.057 --> 08:47.446
He doesn't accessorise all that well.

08:47.497 --> 08:49.488
- Maybe he's not gay.
- Right.

08:49.537 --> 08:52.210
- How do you prove it?
- Simple. Jealousy.

08:52.257 --> 08:55.647
Witnesses said Hale was jealous
when Seth hit on other guys.

08:55.697 --> 08:57.255
The green-eyed monster.

08:57.297 --> 09:00.653
Maybe Hale thought that by working
for Langdon he'd be cured.

09:00.697 --> 09:03.530
Like Langdon thought
Camp Wildbunch cured Seth.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.614
- Daddy knows best.
- And makes sure everyone knows it.

09:06.657 --> 09:11.208
I don't know how people,
smart, educated people think that way.

09:11.257 --> 09:13.725
That you can change the way
someone's wired.

09:13.777 --> 09:16.610
You know anyone
who'd choose to be gay?

09:16.657 --> 09:20.252
Risk family rejection, discrimination...

09:20.297 --> 09:21.810
Choose all that heartache?

09:21.857 --> 09:25.645
Heartache is not unique to being gay.
But I know what you mean.

09:25.697 --> 09:28.655
Those camps give electroshock therapy
to the groin.

09:28.697 --> 09:31.416
- Sound familiar?
- State tried it on sex offenders.

09:31.457 --> 09:34.335
- With equal success.
- So we're like Langdon?

09:34.377 --> 09:37.050
We don't try to rewire people,
just contain them.

09:37.097 --> 09:40.055
Look at him. Steven Hale is fuming.

09:40.097 --> 09:42.452
He's been living a lie. We caught him.

09:42.497 --> 09:45.216
- Course he's mad.
- Specifically, he's mad at you.

09:45.257 --> 09:48.533
Which is why we thought
you'd have better luck.

09:48.577 --> 09:51.375
You're smart,
and God knows you're patient.

09:58.617 --> 10:02.053
- I am not a homosexual.
- OK.

10:02.097 --> 10:05.407
Part of my job was to keep an eye on Seth.

10:05.457 --> 10:09.086
Mr Langdon is seriously eyeing
a run for a congressional seat.

10:09.137 --> 10:12.095
But the scandal
of an openly homosexual son...

10:12.137 --> 10:15.766
Look at the damage
the lesbian sister caused Newt.

10:15.817 --> 10:18.490
Actually, she was a half-sister.

10:18.537 --> 10:22.610
She may have been a half sister,
but sadly for Newt she was all lesbian.

10:25.337 --> 10:29.376
Newt's problems had nothing to do
with his ethics violations

10:29.417 --> 10:33.171
or him being a megalomaniac
who espouses family values

10:33.217 --> 10:37.529
while serving his sick wife
with divorce papers on her deathbed?

10:37.577 --> 10:39.568
'Did that ever occur to you?'

10:39.617 --> 10:42.370
Anybody know where Cassidy is?

10:42.417 --> 10:46.012
Seth didn't show up at his father's
fundraiser that night.

10:46.057 --> 10:48.207
Mr Langdon asked me to check on him.

10:48.257 --> 10:50.896
When I got to his floor, Seth brushed by me.

10:50.937 --> 10:53.656
I followed, giving him a piece of my mind.

10:53.697 --> 10:58.646
And the next thing I knew,
I find myself at that party.

10:58.697 --> 11:02.849
- You were upset he was flirting?
- Because it was revolting.

11:02.897 --> 11:05.730
Of course, I tried to persuade him to leave.

11:05.777 --> 11:07.813
He wouldn't but...

11:07.857 --> 11:10.246
- And what he said...?
- Was not a break-up!

11:10.297 --> 11:13.369
'Stay out of my life'
was a message to his father.

11:14.777 --> 11:18.895
If I'd tried harder to get him away from there,
he'd still be alive.

11:21.617 --> 11:23.096
Hey, guys, where do we stand?

11:23.137 --> 11:27.608
The wife confirms he never left
the house after he got back about 12:30.

11:27.657 --> 11:30.729
He is mentioned in Seth's journal,
in pejorative terms.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.245
Believe me, no love affair there.

11:33.297 --> 11:35.128
Langdon confirms he sent him.

11:35.177 --> 11:37.850
Yeah. We send Steven Hale home.

11:37.897 --> 11:41.651
- With apologies for the inconvenience.
- Of course.

11:41.697 --> 11:44.848
OK, I guess that takes us back
to the party guests.

11:44.897 --> 11:49.448
I cross-referenced them
against the journal, but no matches.

11:49.497 --> 11:51.249
This is some shindig.

11:51.297 --> 11:56.166
Names from the social register,
an assemblyman, an AIDS fundraiser...

11:56.217 --> 11:58.890
None likely to be fans of Seth's father.

11:58.937 --> 12:02.373
Well, prominent or not, let's check'em all.

12:06.057 --> 12:09.766
- Andre Lasnik?
- I'm in the middle of rehearsal!

12:09.817 --> 12:12.411
We're in the middle
of a homicide investigation.

12:15.457 --> 12:19.575
Seth Langdon.
Did you have any interaction with him?

12:19.617 --> 12:22.575
We met in passing.
It's horrible what happened.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.767
- What time did you leave?
- After one,

12:24.817 --> 12:28.526
with my first-chair bassoon
and another couple.

12:28.577 --> 12:32.729
Lee Vaughn and Joaquin Morano.
We took a taxi to the Carlyle.

12:32.777 --> 12:36.452
We understand that Seth was
very... friendly at the party?

12:36.497 --> 12:38.533
You seemed particularly chummy.

12:38.577 --> 12:41.774
Look, I'm almost 20 years his senior.

12:41.817 --> 12:47.687
We talked about his childhood.
Due to the dynamic with the father.

12:47.737 --> 12:53.050
Seth probably sought the affections
of older or unobtainable men.

12:53.097 --> 12:55.657
So you, of course, did the noble thing.

12:55.697 --> 12:59.372
Well, I admit I was torn, I...

12:59.417 --> 13:03.251
I excused myself to the restroom
to get... perspective.

13:03.297 --> 13:06.767
- When I came out, he was gone.
- Was anyone else gone?

13:06.817 --> 13:09.809
Not that I noticed.
Maybe you could tell from the tape.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.290
What tape is that?

13:11.337 --> 13:15.012
Oh, one of the guests had
a camcorder going the whole time.

13:15.057 --> 13:19.255
Assemblyman Rossi's boyfriend Joe,
Joe Bandolini.

13:20.297 --> 13:22.288
- Officer Bandolini?
- Yeah?

13:22.337 --> 13:25.488
Can we have a few minutes
of your time... in private?

13:38.657 --> 13:41.410
- The Langdon case?
- You have a tape of the party?

13:41.457 --> 13:43.732
The party, not the murder.

13:43.777 --> 13:46.769
- It could show what led up to it.
- It doesn't.

13:46.817 --> 13:51.129
- You mind if we judge that for ourselves?
- Actually, I do.

13:51.177 --> 13:54.408
I've kept my personal life
and the job completely separate.

13:54.457 --> 13:58.291
No one knows, not even my partner.
I'd like to keep it that way.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.488
We don't wanna change that.
We'll use discretion.

14:01.537 --> 14:05.974
The tape goes into evidence and
goes round the precinct, I'm finished.

14:06.017 --> 14:08.690
- Not gonna happen.
- You're right, it's not.

14:08.737 --> 14:10.853
You gonna make us get a warrant?

14:14.137 --> 14:18.210
I'm a good cop. If there was anything
to help your investigation, I'd say.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.930
Not good enough. You do right by us.

14:20.977 --> 14:25.209
I promise you... I'm promising
you... we'll do right by you.

14:27.977 --> 14:30.935
I'll... come by your squad room
in the morning.

14:37.697 --> 14:41.087
How did we solve cases back then?
No FBI link-up. No DNA.

14:41.137 --> 14:44.573
- No high-tech forensics.
- Good old-fashioned shoe leather.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.290
- Was Conklin a good detective?
- One of the best,

14:47.337 --> 14:50.374
- may he rest in peace.
- Wish I could've talked to him.

14:50.417 --> 14:54.012
Would've gotten you
more than reading his notes.

14:54.057 --> 14:58.175
He was a spotty note-taker,
but up here, a steel trap.

14:58.217 --> 15:01.766
He remembered every detail
of every case he worked.

15:03.057 --> 15:08.370
Didn't have much on the Benson case.
Any idea what 'pull in CK' means?

15:08.417 --> 15:12.490
CK? This is '68. It's gotta be Carl Kudlak.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.654
We pulled him in
on a bunch of rapes back then.

15:15.697 --> 15:18.689
- Took us forever to pin one on him.
- Why?

15:18.737 --> 15:21.251
Wife alibied him every time.

15:21.297 --> 15:25.654
She killed herself in '72,
or we never would've gotten him.

15:25.697 --> 15:27.289
Thanks.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.406
- You wanted to see me?
- Can you shut the door?

15:35.337 --> 15:38.329
I believe you've met Officer Bandolini.

15:38.377 --> 15:40.732
This is Mr Shore, his GOAL representative.

15:40.777 --> 15:45.214
Do we really need the Gay Officers'
Action League involved in all this?

15:45.257 --> 15:49.614
We understand you and your partner
have been harassing Officer Bandolini.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.217
- I'm afraid we have to intervene.
- Harassed?

15:52.257 --> 15:54.646
We in no way harassed your officer.

15:54.697 --> 15:57.814
We asked him to turn over
a piece of evidence to us.

15:57.857 --> 16:01.645
We don't consider threats
of public humiliation courtesy.

16:01.697 --> 16:05.133
Obviously there's
a misunderstanding here.

16:05.177 --> 16:07.975
Don't forget we're all on the same side.

16:08.017 --> 16:10.770
- Can we work this out amicably?
- Not necessary.

16:10.817 --> 16:14.856
We've reviewed the tape. I assure
you, there's no compelling evidence.

16:14.897 --> 16:18.333
With all due respect,
that's our call to make.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.049
All we need to do is view it.

16:20.097 --> 16:23.089
You have your needs, we have our rights.

16:23.137 --> 16:28.894
If Officer Bandolini is outed,
even accidentally on purpose,

16:28.937 --> 16:32.771
you'll be hit with a defamation suit
that'll make your head spin.

16:36.777 --> 16:38.335
Thank you.

16:46.777 --> 16:50.406
Well, er... this is just great.
They filed an injunction.

16:50.457 --> 16:52.607
You'd better get Benson in here.

16:55.497 --> 16:58.489
I had free time last night
so I looked up your case.

16:58.537 --> 17:01.210
- The Langdon case?
- No, your mother's.

17:02.257 --> 17:06.170
The investigator is dead,
so I spoke to a protege of his.

17:06.217 --> 17:10.335
It's not that I don't appreciate
the thought, but I'm already on it.

17:10.377 --> 17:16.009
I've gone over the report,
listened to his statement, six-packs...

17:16.057 --> 17:18.776
- Spoke to investigators...?
- Trust me.

17:20.817 --> 17:24.526
- I've pulled all there is to pull.
- I don't think this was pullable.

17:29.537 --> 17:33.849
I don't know what it'll come to,
but from what I heard he's right for it.

17:33.897 --> 17:36.536
- You bothering my partner?
- No.

17:38.337 --> 17:39.929
Huh? No.

17:47.617 --> 17:50.734
I have to warn you,
the RFLP wasn't back yet.

17:50.777 --> 17:55.214
But I ran a couple of test results
through the data bank and got a hit.

17:55.257 --> 17:58.647
- What's the name?
- This won't hold up in court,

17:58.697 --> 18:02.133
but I ran the PCR and
the mitochondrial. Quick, but...

18:02.177 --> 18:05.647
- The name.
- Ray Gunther.

18:06.697 --> 18:10.610
- How do I know that name?
- We studied him at the Academy.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.694
He terrorised women
an entire summer in the '80s.

18:13.737 --> 18:16.888
The Parkway Rapist.
But they put him away.

18:18.257 --> 18:20.054
He's out.

18:20.097 --> 18:22.327
No way they'd release Ray Gunther.

18:22.377 --> 18:26.450
He brutally raped seven women.
Two had reconstructive surgery!

18:26.497 --> 18:29.375
Maybe he escaped.
Anything from Sing Sing?

18:29.417 --> 18:33.888
I've been on hold for 10 minutes.
If he escaped he took the staff, too.

18:33.937 --> 18:37.054
I need the DA
who handled the Ray Gunther case.

18:37.097 --> 18:39.565
- He was paroled.
- That was my guess.

18:39.617 --> 18:41.892
- When?
- A month ago.

18:41.937 --> 18:45.247
- Why?
- He served 15 of his 25 to life.

18:45.297 --> 18:48.289
The prisons are overcrowded.
Gotta make room.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.850
So let out Ray Gunther.

18:49.897 --> 18:53.207
Knowing the recidivism rate
of sexual predators?

18:53.257 --> 18:55.327
He's on the register. We got an address?

18:55.377 --> 18:58.528
We do. And you shouldn't
have trouble finding it.

18:58.577 --> 19:01.774
It's in the same building
where Seth Langdon was killed.

19:12.617 --> 19:15.370
- Oh. Hi.
- Jesse Hansen, right?

19:15.417 --> 19:19.854
- Detectives. Did you catch the guy?
- No, but we think we're close.

19:19.897 --> 19:23.094
Do you need anything else?
Do you have any more questions?

19:23.137 --> 19:26.413
Just one. Is there a Ray Gunther
staying with you?

19:26.457 --> 19:29.847
- No. No one's staying with us.
- That's funny.

19:29.897 --> 19:33.333
This is the address he gave
authorities after his parole.

19:33.377 --> 19:35.766
Any idea why he would've done that?

19:37.217 --> 19:39.447
He's my brother.

19:42.177 --> 19:44.486
Why'd you change your last name,
Jesse?

19:45.657 --> 19:49.889
Come on. You legally change your name.
There's gotta be a reason.

19:51.337 --> 19:54.613
Gunther not too popular a name
in your neighbourhood?

19:54.657 --> 19:57.455
- No, it wasn't.
- People gave you a hard time?

19:57.497 --> 19:59.169
Yeah, they did.

19:59.217 --> 20:02.527
Don't let Ray cause more trouble.
Tell us where he is.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.933
- I don't know where he is.
- But you know what he did.

20:09.577 --> 20:10.930
Don't you?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.535
Why are we separated?

20:12.577 --> 20:15.614
- Standard procedure.
- I know my husband.

20:15.657 --> 20:19.696
He won't say anything.
You don't know the hold Ray has over him.

20:19.737 --> 20:24.492
- We're listening.
- Jesse was 15 when they locked Ray up.

20:24.537 --> 20:28.086
Reporters snuck into his high school
and asked him questions

20:28.137 --> 20:30.492
in front of his classmates.

20:30.537 --> 20:34.371
Jesse said he thought
Ray should be put to death.

20:34.417 --> 20:39.252
They ran that as a headline.
Ray has been working that guilt ever since.

20:39.297 --> 20:42.448
Is that why Jesse let him stay with you?

20:42.497 --> 20:45.773
Yes, but I couldn't take it.
I had to put my foot down.

20:45.817 --> 20:49.253
He wanted a job
in Jesse's construction crew.

20:49.297 --> 20:51.891
- That's bad?
- It would've ruined his life.

20:51.937 --> 20:53.893
They'd find out he was Ray's brother?

20:53.937 --> 20:56.895
Because they'd find out he was a Gunther!

20:56.937 --> 20:58.893
The whole family's bad.

20:58.937 --> 21:01.895
The father was in and out of jails
all his miserable life.

21:01.937 --> 21:06.249
The mother's a piece of garbage
and I don't have to tell you about Ray.

21:07.217 --> 21:10.527
There is nothing but bad blood
in that whole family.

21:10.577 --> 21:14.365
Did you see Ray in your building
the night that Seth was killed?

21:18.057 --> 21:21.094
He was in our apartment
till 1:00 in the morning.

21:21.137 --> 21:23.207
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

21:25.657 --> 21:30.014
There's a piece of white trash,
used to visit him in prison.

21:30.057 --> 21:32.890
Erm, a stripper named Cindy Stocklash.

21:32.937 --> 21:35.770
- He might be shacked up with her.
- Any clue where?

21:35.817 --> 21:40.652
When I met her, she was explaining
how she wanted to change motels.

21:40.697 --> 21:42.813
Apparently hers didn't get porn.

21:42.857 --> 21:46.645
Porn. That narrows it down.

21:51.697 --> 21:54.655
'State your name, miss.'

21:54.697 --> 21:56.688
'Serena Benson.'

21:56.737 --> 21:58.693
'Address?'

21:58.737 --> 22:01.615
'1104 West End Avenue. Apartment B.'

22:01.657 --> 22:04.410
'You were raped?'

22:04.457 --> 22:06.925
- 'Yes.'
- 'You've got to speak up, honey.'

22:09.057 --> 22:13.289
'The, er, campus library closed at midnight.

22:13.337 --> 22:16.409
'I took the short cut home I always take.

22:17.457 --> 22:19.846
'It was darker than usual.

22:20.857 --> 22:24.975
'I was halfway through
when something hit me from behind.'

22:25.017 --> 22:28.054
- 'You were knocked unconscious?'
- 'Yes.

22:30.977 --> 22:34.970
'When I came to,
I was on a landing below street level.

22:36.057 --> 22:37.570
'There was...

22:37.617 --> 22:40.211
'a man on top of me.

22:40.257 --> 22:42.691
' He was...

22:43.697 --> 22:46.052
'He pushed up my dress.

22:48.057 --> 22:50.491
'He engaged in sexual intercourse?'

22:53.377 --> 22:56.050
'All right, miss, can you describe him?'

22:58.657 --> 23:01.410
'He had sideburns and, er...

23:02.457 --> 23:03.856
'I don't...

23:03.897 --> 23:06.889
' Everything looked distorted!'

23:14.177 --> 23:16.168
What number was that, four?

23:22.457 --> 23:24.448
- Ooh!
- Come on!

23:24.497 --> 23:26.772
Oh...!

23:26.817 --> 23:29.889
- Who is it?
- Detectives, Miss Stocklash.

23:29.937 --> 23:32.610
We'd like to ask a few questions.

23:32.657 --> 23:34.488
Everything OK in there?

23:36.857 --> 23:38.813
Ray Gunther!

23:38.857 --> 23:40.529
- You OK?
- No!

23:40.577 --> 23:41.976
Good.

23:42.217 --> 23:45.368
Ray! Did you hurt him?
Did they hurt you, Ray?

23:45.417 --> 23:47.772
- Don't you touch him!
- Shut the hell up!

23:47.817 --> 23:50.411
- He didn't do nothing!
- I said shut up!

23:51.617 --> 23:53.892
I'm sorry. What is it you think I did?

23:53.937 --> 23:56.974
- Murdered Seth Langdon.
- You don't have jack.

23:57.017 --> 24:00.726
All we have are witnesses
who put you at the building that night.

24:00.777 --> 24:04.816
- Didn't we have something else?
- Evidence in the victim's mouth.

24:04.857 --> 24:07.576
- Ray!
- It's OK. They got the wrong guy.

24:07.617 --> 24:11.576
You'll look right to the jury.
One month and back to your old tricks.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.336
Think you'd throw'em
by switching to rooftops?

24:14.377 --> 24:19.053
Same excessive force to beat
your victims to a pulp, just like Seth.

24:19.097 --> 24:21.486
But you had trouble adjusting to civilian sex.

24:21.537 --> 24:24.415
- He didn't have no trouble!
- Shut up!

24:24.457 --> 24:27.847
- You're a little confused.
- Why Seth? Why did you pick him?

24:27.897 --> 24:30.331
- I didn't pick nobody.
- Did you even know him?

24:30.377 --> 24:34.734
I saw him in the gym. Me and Jesse
worked out. Sometimes he'd be there.

24:34.777 --> 24:38.452
It was pathetic, him trying
to pump up that puny body of his.

24:38.497 --> 24:42.251
What happened? Did he hit on you
or did you start to like 'em puny?

24:42.297 --> 24:45.687
- He did remind me of a bitch I had.
- You're pathetic.

24:45.737 --> 24:49.616
- What's wrong, jealous, sweetheart?
- Easy.

24:49.657 --> 24:53.127
Not sweetheart.
That's Detective Benson, all right?

24:53.177 --> 24:56.692
I want an apology from you.

24:56.737 --> 24:59.297
I don't need an apology from this slimebag.

24:59.337 --> 25:02.966
But I am getting really sick
of the sarcastic remarks, Ray.

25:07.937 --> 25:11.054
Look, if this is about me
getting overzealous with Ray...

25:11.097 --> 25:13.406
- What?
- Nothing. What's up?

25:14.457 --> 25:18.530
We got real problems here.
The lab got the full DNA report.

25:18.577 --> 25:20.852
- Yeah, and?
- And it ain't Ray's.

25:22.937 --> 25:27.294
Remember I told you the DNA results
wouldn't stand up in court.

25:27.337 --> 25:29.771
All I remember is the name Ray Gunther.

25:29.817 --> 25:33.571
When I gave you Ray's name,
it was off the quickest tests available.

25:33.617 --> 25:37.292
Of which there are two.
I assumed the hit came from the PCR.

25:37.337 --> 25:40.568
As it turns out,
the results weren't from PCR.

25:40.617 --> 25:43.051
PCR narrows it down one in thousands,

25:43.097 --> 25:46.772
compared with RFLP
which narrows it down one in billions.

25:46.817 --> 25:48.853
This came from the mitochondrial.

25:48.897 --> 25:52.606
- What's the difference?
- It only narrows it to bloodline.

25:52.657 --> 25:55.012
So while it's definitely not Ray,

25:55.057 --> 25:58.333
you are still looking for somebody
from that family.

25:58.377 --> 26:01.255
- A father, a son.
- Or a brother.

26:06.057 --> 26:08.890
OK. Look, here's the problem.

26:09.937 --> 26:12.735
We've got this pain-in-the-ass DNA.

26:15.177 --> 26:18.010
- This make any sense to you?
- No.

26:18.057 --> 26:21.493
Me, either, but it just
let your brother off the hook.

26:21.537 --> 26:25.416
- And it puts you in the hot seat.
- Which doesn't make sense to us.

26:25.457 --> 26:28.608
Ray's bad but you've been clean
your whole life.

26:28.657 --> 26:30.249
Can you explain this, Jesse?

26:31.297 --> 26:34.130
- No.
- A blood sample will.

26:35.257 --> 26:36.246
I have to give one?

26:36.297 --> 26:41.007
We can hold you for 24 hours
and get a court order for you to take it.

26:41.057 --> 26:44.811
I've got to tell you, refusing to
take a blood test that'll clear you,

26:44.857 --> 26:47.212
that doesn't look good.

26:48.257 --> 26:52.409
Maybe I should... call a lawyer.

26:53.777 --> 26:56.211
You're free to go.

27:13.257 --> 27:17.170
At his trial, they had Ray dead to rights
so he made a sympathy play.

27:17.217 --> 27:20.926
Sympathy for a serial rapist.
What, 'Women don't understand me'?

27:20.977 --> 27:24.890
He claims he and Jesse were raped
growing up by their dad.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.689
The old Menendez defence.

27:26.737 --> 27:29.205
Could explain a few things about Jesse.

27:29.257 --> 27:33.728
But the prosecution called Jesse.
He said Ray fabricated the story.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.007
So, how do we know which one is lying?

27:36.057 --> 27:40.016
He'll have plenty to say once
we get the go-ahead to take blood.

27:40.057 --> 27:42.491
How about you guys, find anything?

27:42.537 --> 27:44.448
Just a piss-poor gene pool.

27:44.497 --> 27:48.490
- You think Jesse was just born bad?
- Bull. Destiny isn't predetermined.

27:48.537 --> 27:52.974
Twins who were split at birth
and grew up in different environments

27:53.017 --> 27:56.532
have gone on to commit crimes
with the same MOs. Eerie.

27:56.577 --> 28:00.855
Transplanting genes from one species
to another can alter behaviour.

28:00.897 --> 28:04.412
We're not rats, we're humans.
It comes down to how you're raised.

28:04.457 --> 28:08.245
If you instil values,
the kid will turn out all right. If not, trouble.

28:08.297 --> 28:11.846
Nature, nurture, ad nauseum.
You assume a level playing field.

28:11.897 --> 28:13.853
I don't know that there is.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.489
Something wrong?

28:19.537 --> 28:22.609
- It hits a little close to home.
- How's that?

28:23.617 --> 28:26.654
The only way Jesse makes sense in all this

28:26.697 --> 28:29.848
is that they're fruit
from the same poisoned tree.

28:29.897 --> 28:32.457
You don't really believe that, do you?

28:38.057 --> 28:41.129
Your DNA tech pulled
a little Arkansas two-step.

28:41.177 --> 28:45.011
- Took you to the brother first.
- He's been ruled out.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.174
His name came up
cos it was the same bloodline.

28:48.217 --> 28:50.970
Jesse's lawyer is waving
the old ACLU banner.

28:51.017 --> 28:54.453
'Are we testing every relative
of Ray Gunther?'

28:54.497 --> 28:57.455
Just the one that lives
in the victim's building.

28:57.497 --> 29:01.172
I've fast-tracked the hearing
on the blood test for tomorrow.

29:01.217 --> 29:04.812
I'd like a safety net.
What have you got besides the DNA?

29:04.857 --> 29:08.736
- We've got lawyers sandbagging us.
- Right, the video.

29:09.857 --> 29:13.293
- What video?
- Seth at a party before he died.

29:13.337 --> 29:16.932
- It's tied up in litigation, too.
- Any way of getting it untied?

29:18.977 --> 29:22.572
Let me see
if I can make an end run of my own.

29:27.977 --> 29:29.933
Officer Bandolini.

29:29.977 --> 29:33.253
My representative
is not gonna be happy about this.

29:33.297 --> 29:36.050
I realise I'm bending procedure here.

29:36.097 --> 29:38.565
I appreciate you meeting with me.

29:40.377 --> 29:44.529
- You know we need that tape.
- And you know what it can do to me.

29:44.577 --> 29:46.568
Oh, yeah.

29:50.937 --> 29:55.613
In 1926,
Bobby Jones was winning the US Open.

29:55.657 --> 29:58.171
He hits his ball into the woods.

29:58.217 --> 30:02.005
Removes a leaf from under the ball,
accidentally moves it. No one sees.

30:02.057 --> 30:04.446
He hits it out, saves par.

30:04.497 --> 30:07.250
I assume there's a point to this story.

30:07.297 --> 30:11.495
Mr Jones did the honourable thing.
He declared the penalty.

30:12.497 --> 30:14.772
And he went on to win the Open?

30:14.817 --> 30:16.773
No, he lost by a stroke.

30:18.457 --> 30:23.690
But he said he never lost any sleep over it
because he did the right thing.

30:24.697 --> 30:29.054
That was just a game.
This is my life we're talking about.

30:30.097 --> 30:32.486
And how are you sleeping?

30:36.857 --> 30:40.532
I don't know why I brought
the damn camcorder to the party.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.091
That's what I keep kicking myself over.

30:43.137 --> 30:47.767
There's nothing illegal or criminal
on that tape but the consequences...

30:47.817 --> 30:51.366
I will do everything in my power
to make sure there aren't any.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.453
You have my word on that.

31:05.377 --> 31:08.335
You planned on handing this over
all along, didn't you?

31:08.377 --> 31:10.368
Yeah.

31:11.897 --> 31:14.047
But I enjoyed your golf story.

31:20.537 --> 31:21.856
OK, that's Seth.

31:24.697 --> 31:26.892
OK, fast forward. Forward.

31:26.937 --> 31:28.928
- Forward.
- Stop.

31:29.937 --> 31:32.576
Rewind a click. Stop.

31:32.617 --> 31:35.211
Enhance section A6.

31:35.257 --> 31:37.134
Zoom in on the door.

31:39.737 --> 31:43.173
Yeah, there's Jesse.
Let's see if he joins the party.

31:43.217 --> 31:46.368
- You know about video analysing.
- I've dabbled a little.

31:48.337 --> 31:51.135
- Dammit! He didn't come in.
- Forward.

31:54.897 --> 31:56.250
Stop.

31:56.297 --> 31:59.095
Go back to the part about the door again.

32:01.257 --> 32:03.725
Go back to just before the door opened.

32:10.297 --> 32:11.810
Stop.

32:11.857 --> 32:13.609
Zoom in on the mirror.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.253
That ain't Jesse. That's Ray.

32:22.297 --> 32:24.128
Back to Ray.

32:24.177 --> 32:28.170
We need to talk to Lorraine,
find out what time they came back.

32:30.297 --> 32:33.016
- I told you, Jesse came right back.
- Ray didn't.

32:33.057 --> 32:34.809
No, we went to bed right after that.

32:34.857 --> 32:38.816
Mrs Hansen, I need to tell you
that providing a false alibi is a felony.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.894
It's insane! You have Jesse
accused of Ray's crime.

32:41.937 --> 32:45.088
Ray has been hellbent on destroying
Jesse his whole life.

32:45.137 --> 32:48.334
- Why would he wanna do that to him?
- I dunno.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.533
Ray would call from prison, every week,

32:57.577 --> 33:00.535
until Jesse would finally cave in
and go see him.

33:00.577 --> 33:03.455
And after the visits.

33:03.497 --> 33:06.648
Jesse would come home
and go into deep depressions.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.007
He wouldn't talk to me about it.

33:10.057 --> 33:14.289
He'd just go on these... alcohol binges

33:14.337 --> 33:17.807
and disappear, sometimes even for days.

33:19.657 --> 33:22.296
That must have been really hard for you.

33:22.337 --> 33:25.135
When he came back,
he'd be his old self again.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.737
I promise you, Jesse's a good man.

33:27.777 --> 33:31.850
- It's his brother that's poison.
- I can't say we disagree.

33:31.897 --> 33:35.936
The problem is it wasn't
Ray's seminal fluid in Seth's mouth.

33:36.937 --> 33:39.212
But it's definitely the same bloodline.

33:39.257 --> 33:42.374
- You're lying.
- Mrs Hansen...

33:43.857 --> 33:46.610
Why do you think Jesse
won't give us the blood test?

33:53.017 --> 33:55.008
Ray came over at 7:00.

33:57.057 --> 33:59.332
They drank the whole night again.

33:59.377 --> 34:02.733
They went up at 1:00 about the music.

34:02.777 --> 34:05.655
Jesse did come right back down alone.

34:05.697 --> 34:09.246
- Then what happened?
- Ray came back a few minutes later.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.367
Dragged Jesse out with him.

34:16.817 --> 34:19.650
Jesse didn't come home till after 2:00.

34:25.577 --> 34:27.568
- It was a joke.
- A joke?

34:27.617 --> 34:30.768
- We'd see the fag in the gym...
- His name was Seth.

34:30.817 --> 34:35.254
Right, Seth. When we'd see
that little fag Seth in the gym.

34:35.297 --> 34:38.255
- I'd rib Jesse it's his girlfriend.
- Hysterical.

34:38.297 --> 34:40.652
It gets funnier. I'd catch his eye,

34:40.697 --> 34:43.574
nod over at Jesse and wink.

34:44.617 --> 34:47.574
Seth blushed like a little schoolgirl.

34:47.617 --> 34:50.051
- The punch line?
- It came that night.

34:50.097 --> 34:53.885
Start with going up to the party.
We have you on tape with Seth.

34:53.937 --> 34:57.612
When they opened the door,
I see him looking out.

34:57.657 --> 34:59.966
I go right into the old bit.

35:00.017 --> 35:04.295
I nod over to Jesse,
and give Seth a big old wink.

35:05.777 --> 35:09.770
When the door closes,
I ask Jesse if he saw his girlfriend.

35:10.817 --> 35:14.605
He throws a punch! But he was
so plastered he missed by a mile.

35:14.657 --> 35:17.569
- Then he staggers down the hall.
- And you wait?

35:17.617 --> 35:20.177
Yep, and out prances Seth.

35:20.217 --> 35:22.777
I put my arm round him and say,

35:22.817 --> 35:26.093
'Go up on the roof.
Jesse will be right up.'

35:26.137 --> 35:28.856
- Then you went and you got Jesse.
- Why?

35:28.897 --> 35:30.967
Sibling rivalry.

35:39.457 --> 35:42.051
Our daddy did everything I said he did.

35:43.457 --> 35:46.608
Jesse should've been a man,
stood up for me at my trial.

35:46.657 --> 35:49.854
- Jesse was 15 at your trial.
- 15 is a lot of years.

35:50.537 --> 35:54.576
That's how many I served because of him.
I could've been out in five.

35:54.617 --> 35:58.053
You did 15 cos of what you did, not Jesse.

36:02.537 --> 36:06.132
I think it's horrible
that my baby brother killed a man.

36:06.177 --> 36:08.327
But... he did.

36:08.377 --> 36:11.369
And, as much as you'd like to,

36:11.417 --> 36:13.692
you can't pin it on me.

36:13.737 --> 36:16.535
- I had nothing to do with it.
- You set it up.

36:18.057 --> 36:20.048
I set up a practical joke.

36:21.937 --> 36:23.928
Is there a law against that?

36:29.937 --> 36:31.734
Ray told us everything, Jesse.

36:33.697 --> 36:36.131
Your brother set you up.

36:36.177 --> 36:38.850
I lied... at his trial.

36:40.257 --> 36:42.452
Ray was telling the truth.

36:43.657 --> 36:46.774
Our... father really did do those things.

36:46.817 --> 36:49.012
To both of you?

36:49.057 --> 36:51.207
I tried to forget.

36:51.257 --> 36:53.452
Ray wouldn't let me.

36:55.457 --> 36:59.928
Even as kids, he would tell me
how awful it was for him,

36:59.977 --> 37:02.810
- but that I liked it.
- Nobody thinks that, Jesse.

37:02.857 --> 37:04.495
You were only seven years old.

37:06.617 --> 37:09.051
Whenever I'd visit Ray at Sing Sing,

37:09.097 --> 37:12.214
he'd tell me, 'You just wait!'

37:13.217 --> 37:17.096
'You'll end up here sooner or later.
It's your legacy.'

37:19.217 --> 37:21.447
Jesse, tell us what happened on the roof.

37:23.057 --> 37:26.936
I... I was wasted.
I don't even remember how I got there.

37:26.977 --> 37:28.535
All...

37:29.537 --> 37:33.655
All I could hear was Ray's voice
drawing me up there.

37:33.697 --> 37:36.257
It didn't seem real.

37:38.857 --> 37:41.246
Someone was on their knees...

37:43.257 --> 37:44.929
I...

37:46.537 --> 37:49.370
My pants were down.

37:57.697 --> 37:59.688
I killed him.

38:02.017 --> 38:05.976
- 'I killed him!'
- I'll file charges for man one.

38:06.017 --> 38:11.011
'You said you heard Ray's
voice drawing you up to the roof?'

38:11.057 --> 38:13.287
Abbie, hold on.

38:13.337 --> 38:16.852
'Could you hear his voice
once you got up there?'

38:18.537 --> 38:21.335
'I could hear him
laughing at me, yeah!'

38:22.337 --> 38:26.296
Jesse... that's because
he was there, wasn't he?

38:27.937 --> 38:31.213
I just remember
coming out of a fog

38:31.257 --> 38:35.648
and seeing Ray standing in the doorway.
He was laughing.

38:36.657 --> 38:38.807
And I looked down

38:38.857 --> 38:41.530
and I saw what Seth was doing.

38:44.177 --> 38:47.647
And Ray said, 'I told you!'

38:47.697 --> 38:49.972
I told you what, that you were gay?

38:51.497 --> 38:53.772
I wanted to kill him!

38:53.817 --> 38:55.375
Why?

38:55.417 --> 38:57.487
What did he do to you?

38:57.537 --> 39:00.005
No, not Seth, Ray!

39:00.057 --> 39:02.207
I wanted to kill Ray.

39:02.257 --> 39:08.366
I just started lashing out at him
cos in my mind, I was hitting Ray.

39:08.417 --> 39:11.056
But he just kept laughing

39:11.097 --> 39:13.531
and laughing.

39:18.337 --> 39:20.612
I had to shut him up!

39:23.457 --> 39:27.370
I took his head and I started bashing.

39:29.057 --> 39:33.289
And I just bashed it and bashed it
as hard as I could.

39:40.057 --> 39:42.446
It was finally quiet.

39:44.417 --> 39:48.933
But I looked down and it wasn't Ray!
It was Seth!

39:48.977 --> 39:51.172
Where was Ray?

39:51.217 --> 39:53.253
He was...

39:53.297 --> 39:56.289
He was still standing in the doorway.

39:59.817 --> 40:02.377
And he said...

40:02.417 --> 40:05.011
He said, 'Welcome to the family!'

40:12.777 --> 40:15.496
- Tell me we can charge Ray.
- Uh-huh.

40:15.537 --> 40:18.449
Inciting a murder. Depraved indifference.

40:18.497 --> 40:20.772
- Accessory.
- That's good for a start.

40:20.817 --> 40:23.968
With Ray's priors,
he'll do more time than Jesse.

40:24.017 --> 40:25.848
Make sure he does, Abbie.

40:28.697 --> 40:33.009
You heard him. Ray was screwing
with his brother's mind his whole life.

40:33.057 --> 40:34.809
Nothing to do with blood.

40:34.857 --> 40:38.406
What Jesse did happened
because Jesse believed it would.

40:38.457 --> 40:40.448
You know that, right?

40:42.457 --> 40:46.450
- There's something I need to do.
- What good will it do to know?

41:25.577 --> 41:28.489
He's not my father.

41:28.537 --> 41:30.812
You sure?

41:34.057 --> 41:35.536
Positive.
