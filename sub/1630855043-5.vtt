WEBVTT

00:15.145 --> 00:17.843
- Happy Valentine's Day, ma'am.
Delivery for--

00:17.887 --> 00:19.932
- Give it here. In future,

00:19.976 --> 00:22.500
no need to knock as though
you're waking the dead.

00:22.544 --> 00:25.112
It's a knocker,
not a battering ram.

00:26.809 --> 00:29.333
- Oh! Isn't Basil a darling!

00:29.377 --> 00:32.336
[Viviana laughing]
- Heavens, sister,
it isn't even 10 of the clock.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.731
- Oh! Violet creams.
Someone loosen my stays.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.646
[laughing]
Mm!

00:37.689 --> 00:39.517
- "Wilt thou be mine?

00:39.561 --> 00:44.218
A token of my passion for thee,
most beautiful and beloved--"

00:44.261 --> 00:46.437
- Mm! Mm. Mm-hmm?

00:46.481 --> 00:47.830
- "--Verdi."

00:54.924 --> 00:57.187
- We are selling her...
immediately!

01:08.416 --> 01:10.244
- I suppose I should go.

01:16.119 --> 01:19.775
- Oh...
you take everything you want...

01:20.950 --> 01:23.474
...everything you need
and just run off.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.088
I see how you play.
[Georges chuckling]

01:30.090 --> 01:32.092
- You've done too much for me
already.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.835
- Let me do more.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.362
- Molto grazie.

01:42.145 --> 01:45.104
But I'm hoping I don't need
another alibi today.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.457
[sighing]
Or another rescue
from police torture.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.678
Maybe tomorrow.

01:59.858 --> 02:02.078
Ah, I really need to go.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.559
- Please stay.
[Georges chuckling]

02:09.738 --> 02:11.609
- I don't want to impose.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.919
- I'll feel better if you stay.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.143
For me.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.247
[distant moaning]

02:43.337 --> 02:45.208
[distant groaning]

03:07.665 --> 03:09.537
[dramatic music]

03:10.277 --> 03:12.061
- Miss!

03:12.103 --> 03:14.324
Happy Saint Valentine's.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.413
- What is this?

03:16.457 --> 03:18.415
- Well, it's an apple,
of course.

03:18.459 --> 03:21.026
[chuckling]
A Valentine's apple.
[bell tolling]

03:21.070 --> 03:23.551
- Next time, miss,
bring somethin' useful.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.553
A man with a job.

03:34.692 --> 03:38.392
- It can be difficult
to seem grateful
when one wants for so much mo--

03:38.435 --> 03:41.482
- But she's right.
Wh-what real use is an apple?

03:41.525 --> 03:45.094
I want to help these people,
Andrew. Really help.

03:45.137 --> 03:48.358
Not simply paper
over the problem
with a new pattern.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.099
- And you shall.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.884
Your determination is unmatched.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.758
[woman screaming]

03:56.801 --> 03:59.239
[man and woman shouting]

04:01.415 --> 04:03.155
[shouting continues]

04:04.374 --> 04:07.072
[exclamations]
[woman shouting]

04:07.116 --> 04:10.250
- Ladies, look away.
[hysterical background chatter]

04:19.868 --> 04:21.391
[screaming]

04:30.095 --> 04:32.272
- Rigor mortis
is firmly established.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.797
There's already
a slight loosening
of the shoulder joints.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.801
- Which means he's been dead
for a little while.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.629
- Twelve hours, give or take.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.544
- I'm seeing lots of abrasions.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.291
- Premortem...
along with bruising,
broken bones.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.858
- Do you think he was beaten?

04:53.902 --> 04:55.425
Tortured?

04:55.469 --> 04:57.384
- No. Dragged.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.126
There's a lot of grit
in the abrasions,
which are also linear.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.782
So by horse or behind a wagon,
perhaps.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.567
- The Widow's not getting
any gentler.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.352
- Nor is she slowing down any.

05:09.396 --> 05:12.094
- We should move the body
back to the operating theatre.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.315
- Found this in his toga.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.795
Happy Valentine's to me.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.411
- "One shot the arrow,

05:24.454 --> 05:26.761
Another strung the bow,

05:26.804 --> 05:29.677
A third cut the marrow
and a fourth told her no.

05:30.678 --> 05:34.812
But the one
who lured the sparrow,
The one who set the bait...

05:36.945 --> 05:40.296
He will die in pieces
and suffer all my hate."

05:46.781 --> 05:49.261
I need you to help the doctor
transport away the body.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.395
Mullman, you need to search
the area for any horses or carts

05:52.439 --> 05:54.266
that could've been used
to do this.

05:54.310 --> 05:57.748
Look for blood, tissue,
ropes, chains,
any evidence of dragging.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.663
Are my witnesses still here?

06:05.190 --> 06:07.279
[Regina]: Thank you.
[horse neighing]

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
- My apologies.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.287
I need to ask if there's
anything else you'd like
to add to your statement.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.768
- Nothing that I can think of
at the moment, no.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.249
- We'll call on you
if there's anything else
we need.

06:20.292 --> 06:23.383
- Well, Regina,
I have an appointment

06:23.426 --> 06:26.386
to counsel a parishioner,
but I could walk you as far as--

06:26.429 --> 06:28.997
- I wonder, actually,
Mrs. Simcoe,

06:29.040 --> 06:30.564
if I could have a moment.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.435
- Of course.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.933
- Good afternoon, Mr. Garvey.
I... wasn't expecting you.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.588
- Well, it's Saint Valentine's.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.807
- Yes. And...

06:56.851 --> 06:59.331
yesterday was the thirteenth
and...

06:59.375 --> 07:01.159
tomorrow will be the fifteenth.

07:01.203 --> 07:06.295
[chuckling]
- I'm eager to hear how
very much you enjoyed my gift.

07:06.338 --> 07:09.429
- I-I'm sorry?
- The chocolates.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.257
[sighing]

07:12.301 --> 07:15.391
I shall wring
that delivery boy's neck myself

07:15.435 --> 07:18.046
and have another box delivered
straight away.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.830
- That's... not necessary.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.224
- You, beautiful girl,

07:22.267 --> 07:24.356
should have the stars
and the moon.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.056
Least I can do is secure
another large box of...

07:28.099 --> 07:30.537
really quite expensive sweeties.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.628
- I cannot and will never be
your valentine.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.500
- Well...
that is where we disagree.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.982
- I could never betray Viviana.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.201
- Every girl has her weakness.

07:43.245 --> 07:46.683
I've learned yours
is not chocolate. So...

07:46.727 --> 07:49.860
flowers perhaps?
Fashionable gowns?

07:49.904 --> 07:52.080
- Mr. Garvey,
this cannot happen.
None of this can--

07:52.123 --> 07:53.908
- Would you like a horse?

07:56.650 --> 07:57.955
Verdi.

08:01.437 --> 08:04.875
Think of yourself... for once.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.922
Of your own desires and...

08:07.965 --> 08:09.619
womanly needs.

08:12.796 --> 08:16.365
- I have not and will never
betray my sisters.

08:16.974 --> 08:20.151
It is unconscionable of you
to ask that of me.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.718
Now leave.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.114
Go.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.269
- Where did you get this?
- I tore it from the Widow
herself.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.054
- Black silk.

08:53.097 --> 08:56.840
Somewhat degraded and worn,
but quite good quality.

08:57.362 --> 09:00.104
- It-it seemed
like something unique.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.585
- You're right.
It's chirimen silk.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.762
- What's that?
- It's Japanese...

09:05.806 --> 09:07.938
I think. Rather rare.

09:09.026 --> 09:12.160
I have an idea of just who
we can ask about its origin.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.558
- Ah, Mrs. Simcoe!
I have a new chiffon.
Just arrived from New York.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.472
- Mr. Chow,
this is Detective Rijkers.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.213
- But I also just received
organdy.

09:22.257 --> 09:26.043
Reseda green,
perfect for your eyes.
A, uh, new suit, perhaps.

09:26.087 --> 09:29.264
- We've actually come
with a very specific question.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.396
Can you tell me what this is,
please?

09:32.876 --> 09:34.225
- Hmm.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.838
It smells of mold.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.144
Poorly kept, but...

09:41.145 --> 09:44.322
Oh, but it is silk.
Mm... chirimen.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.021
- Do you sell this fabric?
- Hang on.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.590
Hmm.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.554
Hmm.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.601
Everything you need.
Eighty-three cents per yard.

10:03.907 --> 10:07.302
- Well, firstly,
that is robbery most hideous.
And...

10:08.433 --> 10:11.001
...secondly,
this isn't the same quality.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.699
And you, sir, know it.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.703
- Fine. I don't carry chirimen.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.314
There's no demand for it
in this boondock town.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.404
But I have ordered
a chirimen kimono,
straight from Kyoto.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.452
- Who?
Who did you order this for?

10:28.018 --> 10:31.500
- That harlot, Salomé.
- From The Queen's Chamber?

10:32.762 --> 10:34.938
- He wasn't always
from The Chamber.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.419
He might think himself
a fancy lady now,

10:37.462 --> 10:40.770
but he used to work the street
right around here.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.698
[sighing]

10:57.613 --> 11:01.704
- A peacock doesn't catch a mate
by wearing drab things,
Margaret.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.575
[hooves clopping]

11:04.141 --> 11:05.795
[whinnying]

11:05.839 --> 11:09.016
- Peahens are plain and brown,
Salomé.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.802
It's only the male peacocks
who feel the need to show off.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.849
- Well, that explains it, then.
- Mm-hmm.
[laughter]

11:17.720 --> 11:20.375
- Ah... How do you do it?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.813
Afford all these handsome
things?

11:25.685 --> 11:29.558
- Beg, borrow... steal. Hmm.

11:30.037 --> 11:34.258
Mr. Chow at the haberdashery
lets me do a small favour

11:34.302 --> 11:36.478
for a luxury or two.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.351
- I...
[laughter]

11:42.310 --> 11:44.747
Someday I'll have fine things,
too.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.402
I'll find a way.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.845
- One half dollar...

11:57.064 --> 11:59.109
...for a knee-trembler
up the alley.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.894
- Oh, sir...

12:00.937 --> 12:04.419
couldn't we perhaps find
somewhere a little more private?

12:04.462 --> 12:07.770
- No. It's this or nothing.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.598
I'm expected at dinner.

12:13.297 --> 12:17.519
- This little peahen is shy
about what goes up her alley
and where.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.914
But my alley's open
at all hours...

12:21.741 --> 12:23.786
...and for all comers.

12:31.707 --> 12:32.752
- Okay.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.764
[sighing]

12:44.807 --> 12:47.027
[grunting]

12:47.070 --> 12:49.290
[glass breaking]
[grunting]

12:50.465 --> 12:52.075
[crying out]

12:54.382 --> 12:56.601
[Salomé]: Ah...
[groaning]

12:57.037 --> 12:59.039
[exclamations]

12:59.866 --> 13:03.217
Well...
who says romance is dead?

13:03.913 --> 13:05.872
[laughing]

13:07.047 --> 13:08.700
- Fuck me!

13:08.744 --> 13:10.920
- I just did.
[chuckling]

13:12.617 --> 13:15.795
Coins for the pretty little
match girl, please?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.622
[Alistair laughing]

13:19.189 --> 13:20.843
- I don't pay boys.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.065
- Pardon me?
- Pardon you.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.720
Women hate it.
That's why you gotta pay
for pussy.

13:28.764 --> 13:32.289
But you deviants?
Oh, you love this shit.
You should pay me.

13:33.116 --> 13:37.120
- It's my job. It's how I eat.
- Well...

13:37.164 --> 13:41.168
if you want...
you can always eat my cock
again.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.998
- Fucking pay me my money
right now.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.661
[gasping]

13:56.705 --> 13:59.664
- I have to warn people
not to buy your cream.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.971
It's sour.
[Salomé screaming]

14:03.407 --> 14:05.583
[screaming]

14:11.415 --> 14:12.852
- Hmm?

14:14.679 --> 14:18.770
Wouldn't you like
to eat your supper
off those fresh, perky bosoms?

14:18.814 --> 14:22.687
And then you could eat breakfast
off that pert little derrière.

14:22.731 --> 14:25.168
Hell, I would,
and I don't even like
playing with girls.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.909
[Salomé chuckling]

14:26.953 --> 14:28.955
- Price?

14:29.956 --> 14:32.262
- Don't be crass, Mr. MacDonald.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.700
That little angel's love
is beyond price.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.274
- These the ones she wore?
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.189
- Mm...

14:47.843 --> 14:49.323
[sniffing]
- Uh...

14:49.366 --> 14:51.368
Oh.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.066
- Mm...

14:55.982 --> 14:57.026
How much?

14:58.549 --> 15:00.377
- I'm always open to offers.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.075
[knocking]

15:02.814 --> 15:04.164
Everyone out.

15:05.121 --> 15:07.471
Photographs. Come, come, come.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.779
We'll pick this up later.

15:14.826 --> 15:18.482
I will always dance on that lap
of yours, Mr. MacDonald.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.096
Hello, King.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.409
- What's this little gathering,
then?

15:33.323 --> 15:35.499
- Just a little post-show
adulation.

15:36.065 --> 15:39.025
The stage-door Johnnies
simply love Salomé.

15:39.068 --> 15:42.376
- I know you wouldn't cut me out
of any profits here.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.160
Not under my own roof.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.075
- My darling, no.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.644
You're not jealous, are you?

15:50.775 --> 15:52.429
Are you?

15:52.473 --> 15:54.127
[chuckling]

15:55.258 --> 15:59.436
- That copper's here to see you.
- Oh... poo.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.963
- Do you own any Japanese silks?

16:04.746 --> 16:09.794
- You know, Detective,
you don't have to come up with
excuses to fondle my dainties.

16:09.838 --> 16:14.321
Sometimes people just show up
and tell me their urges,

16:14.364 --> 16:16.671
and I satisfy them.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.586
Amazing, no?

16:18.629 --> 16:21.937
- I'll need to take this one
for examination.
- Oh.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.809
I didn't have you figured
for a Mikado fetish.

16:25.636 --> 16:30.032
But Salomé will happily
be all three little maids
from school -

16:30.076 --> 16:31.773
for the right price.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.474
- Tell me,
where were you last night?
- Where I always am.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.911
Wiggling my teacakes
for the gentlemen.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.305
- Not all night.

16:42.349 --> 16:46.005
- It feels like it sometimes,
trust me.
[hubbub]

16:48.268 --> 16:50.009
[people shouting]

16:52.663 --> 16:56.058
By the by, I expect
to get that kimono back

16:56.102 --> 17:00.541
in the same pristine condition
in which I am loaning it to you.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.282
- This isn't a loan.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.501
This is evidence
in a murder case,

17:04.545 --> 17:08.330
which you seem
to be rather nonchalant about.
I could arrest you right now.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.464
- Mm, Detective,

17:10.507 --> 17:12.814
handcuffs can be enjoyable.

17:13.510 --> 17:17.036
But first,
you might want to check
on your fellas out there.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.909
[people shouting]
[creaking]
- Ow!

17:20.952 --> 17:23.564
[boy screaming]
- You filthy little beggar!

17:23.607 --> 17:26.132
- I didn't do nothing!
- I asked you a question!

17:26.175 --> 17:27.742
- Hey!
- Ow!

17:27.785 --> 17:29.657
- Hey! Mullman!
- Yeah, you do!

17:29.700 --> 17:32.573
- Mullman, get off him!
- Hey, get off!
- Mullman, that's an order!

17:32.616 --> 17:36.577
- He knows something!
Him and all these other
gutter beggars 'round here!

17:36.620 --> 17:38.535
- Where's your evidence?
- Fuck evidence!

17:38.579 --> 17:42.800
I don't need evidence!
They're all laughing at us,
and you know why?

17:42.844 --> 17:45.760
'Cause Kashtinsky was murdered
and disrespected,

17:45.803 --> 17:48.850
and you're doing sweet fuck all
about it!

17:49.720 --> 17:52.114
- You need to go back to--

17:52.158 --> 17:55.074
Back to the station now. Go.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.077
We'll discuss this privately.
Go.

18:11.002 --> 18:14.354
- I would like to speak
to whichever esteemed idiot

18:14.397 --> 18:16.704
is now running
our very own Shitland Yard!

18:16.747 --> 18:20.664
- Mr. Garvey.
- It is fucking chaos out there!

18:20.708 --> 18:24.103
Not to put
too fine a point on it,
your men are running hog wild!

18:24.146 --> 18:27.454
Smashing windows
in my businesses,
roughing up my delivery boys.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.891
- The situation is now in hand.
- Is it?!

18:29.934 --> 18:33.024
If my business is disturbed
for five more minutes,

18:33.068 --> 18:36.419
I will have your empty,
unqualified head
on a goddamned platter.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.334
- It's been handled, sir.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.559
- I've got my eyes on you.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.300
Whole city does.

18:47.343 --> 18:50.912
You haven't even managed
to figure out who killed
Alistair Simcoe.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.436
Can't be that hard.
Throw a brick,

18:53.480 --> 18:56.178
and even you would hit someone
he screwed!

18:56.222 --> 18:57.919
[exclaiming softly]

19:00.400 --> 19:01.792
- Ah...

19:05.753 --> 19:07.407
- Who did this to you?

19:08.799 --> 19:10.758
- Even if I knew his name...

19:12.151 --> 19:14.196
...he's a "gentleman,"

19:14.240 --> 19:17.112
so he'd get off scot-free.
[wincing]

19:17.156 --> 19:19.114
- I'm so sorry, sweetie.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.986
- But I promise you...

19:22.900 --> 19:25.425
...if I get a chance at him
in an alley...

19:26.252 --> 19:27.905
...he's a eunuch.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.909
A dead eunuch...

19:31.953 --> 19:33.563
with no nose.

19:34.129 --> 19:37.698
- You can cut off his nose
to spite his cock.
[guffawing]

19:37.741 --> 19:40.353
- Oh. Ouch.
- I'm sorry.

19:45.532 --> 19:49.623
Apply this salve tonight.
I'll be back to check
on the wound tomorrow evening.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.756
- I don't know
where I'll be tomorrow,

19:52.800 --> 19:56.195
but I can't work like this,
I can't pay for my room.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.110
- He'll be staying here.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.375
Thank you, Doctor.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.595
- Right, then.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.338
I'll see you then.
- Thank you.

20:13.777 --> 20:16.258
I'm... staying here tomorrow?

20:16.302 --> 20:18.217
That's a surprise.

20:18.260 --> 20:22.090
- What am I supposed to do,
throw you out on the street?
[door closing]

20:22.133 --> 20:25.180
You came here asking
for my help and protection so...

20:25.833 --> 20:27.574
...I'm giving you both.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.545
- What's your pleasure?

20:48.290 --> 20:51.250
- For you to be warm and safe
tonight.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.255
- B-but I have to pay somehow.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.953
Salomé doesn't accept charity.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.303
- Salomé needs to recover.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.526
We'll figure something out
later.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.448
You sing?

21:18.494 --> 21:20.670
- Like a... budgie.

21:20.714 --> 21:24.805
I mean, I...
aspire to canary levels,

21:24.848 --> 21:28.461
but I've never had the luxury
of practice time.

21:28.504 --> 21:33.422
- Huh. My female impersonator
got deported back to Cyprus.

21:34.597 --> 21:38.166
Shall we try you out tomorrow...
around the piano?

21:43.127 --> 21:45.086
- If it pleases the king.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.264
- Good night, Salomé.

22:03.974 --> 22:07.064
- Ah.
- The prices are lower
than we expected.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.330
- I planned
on Sunday roast prices.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.768
These offers put Verdi
in the category of eel pie.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.292
- Perhaps if we widen our nets,
find...

22:17.336 --> 22:19.642
more gentlemen
with deeper pockets.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.428
- Or we sell her, get our price,

22:22.471 --> 22:25.822
take her back,
get her virginity restitched,

22:25.866 --> 22:27.998
sell her again.
[Salomé laughing]

22:28.042 --> 22:33.090
- Somehow I find you both
fiendish and an inspiration.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.179
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm...

22:35.223 --> 22:37.791
This wouldn't happen
if we were in Paris.

22:37.834 --> 22:42.665
People here are too afraid
of being exposed to buy a girl.

22:42.709 --> 22:46.016
- What if,
instead of widening our net,
we narrowed it?

22:47.191 --> 22:51.718
- So you do want to go to Paris?
Or you could send me
on your behalf.

22:51.761 --> 22:56.505
The French people
are disgusting...
in the best way.

22:57.637 --> 23:01.118
Deals made over Champagne
are always larger.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.644
- No.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.647
I think we might secure
our lucre...

23:07.690 --> 23:09.953
much, much closer to home.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.788
You know, Mr. Garvey, I hold you
in the highest esteem.

23:19.572 --> 23:23.140
As a hard-working gentleman,
I believe that you should have
everything your heart desires.

23:23.184 --> 23:26.579
- Mm-hmm.
- That includes marriage
to my sister Viviana,

23:26.622 --> 23:28.276
who you have
essentially promised--

23:28.319 --> 23:31.453
- I have done no such thing.
- Ah, please.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.847
Allow me the courtesy
of a fellow businessman,

23:33.890 --> 23:36.806
for I am indeed here...
with a proposition.

23:40.157 --> 23:44.423
I've also noticed
that there are other luxuries
that you desire.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.557
A man of your calibre...

23:48.601 --> 23:51.473
should be able
to purchase himself...

23:51.517 --> 23:53.170
a little treat...

23:53.214 --> 23:55.434
before he's forever wed.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.763
- This is despicable.

24:22.635 --> 24:25.289
I'm disgusted you think
I would even entertain
such a proposition.

24:25.333 --> 24:29.468
- Oh, I only have
dear little Verdi's
best intentions at heart.

24:30.947 --> 24:35.430
I hope my deep concern for her
hasn't led me to overstep.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.607
We do so want...
what's best for her.

25:15.426 --> 25:18.995
- Does this foot-washing
folderol mean you're Jesus
and I'm Judas?

25:19.039 --> 25:20.519
- Huh.

25:22.216 --> 25:25.175
I think it means
that you're Jesus...
and I'm Mary Magdalene.

25:25.219 --> 25:28.570
- Oh! No wonder we're having
so much sex.

25:31.181 --> 25:32.835
But truthfully...

25:32.879 --> 25:36.317
I'm more of a...
fallen-angel sort.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.540
- There's nothing fallen
about you.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.412
You're a good and worthy man.

25:44.455 --> 25:47.241
And it is good and worthy
to let me take care of you.

25:53.943 --> 25:57.077
- I think Venetia Botticelli
is selling her younger sister.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.560
Into sex slavery.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.956
- What? Why do you think that?

26:08.218 --> 26:10.656
- Venetia was here...
this afternoon.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.440
- What the hell was she...?

26:15.791 --> 26:16.966
Salomé.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.578
- He was taking bids.

26:26.585 --> 26:30.284
- You. You are not participating
in the sale of that young lady!

26:31.372 --> 26:33.417
- Oh... you heard.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.898
- How ever d'you think
I wouldn't?!

26:35.942 --> 26:38.814
- Sorry for being a sneak,
Daddy. I'll cut you in.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.251
- What you're doing
is disgusting!

26:41.295 --> 26:43.732
And I forbid it to go further!

26:43.776 --> 26:47.649
- You sell women every day.
- I sell women
who want to be sold!

26:47.693 --> 26:50.086
- Do you ask "your women"
how they feel?

26:50.130 --> 26:52.567
Plenty of times,
we don't want to do it,
trust me.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.179
Plenty of pigs
we don't want to fuck
just to fatten your wallet!

26:56.223 --> 26:58.181
- Oh, oh, I lived that life.

26:58.225 --> 27:01.184
And I pay them well.
They chose this!

27:02.011 --> 27:06.842
- But none of us has
as much choice as that useless,
little rich bitch.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.628
- I made sure you did well here!

27:13.109 --> 27:16.896
- Let's not lie to each other
about who was the profiteer.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.294
How'd you find out
about this anyway?

27:24.338 --> 27:26.079
- That's not
what we're discussing.

27:28.777 --> 27:32.041
- That's why you're so outraged.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.957
Because your little Georgie
found out about it.

27:35.001 --> 27:38.831
And you want to pretend
you're better than you are
with your fake outrage!

27:38.874 --> 27:41.616
- Don't be jealous.
It's fucking boring.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.487
- You think I'm jealous?

27:43.531 --> 27:46.708
- I think
you're a pretentious little twat

27:46.752 --> 27:49.624
who fancies himself
way too highly!

27:50.581 --> 27:54.455
- And you're a faithless pimp
who thinks he's better
than he is.

27:55.282 --> 27:57.850
Now get the fuck
out of my room!

27:57.893 --> 28:00.200
- No. No, no, no, no.

28:00.243 --> 28:04.073
You get the fuck
out of my house!

28:04.117 --> 28:07.816
- You can't kick me out!
- I can and I have!

28:07.860 --> 28:10.036
You wanna go pretend
to be a big pimp?

28:10.079 --> 28:12.691
[scoffing]
See how you do without me.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.693
You know what?

28:14.736 --> 28:18.305
I won't miss this
for a fucking second!

28:18.348 --> 28:22.570
You think I wanna fuck you?
I wouldn't fucking touch you!

28:22.613 --> 28:24.398
Get the fuck out!

28:24.441 --> 28:26.835
You disgusting faggot!

28:28.489 --> 28:30.012
[exclaiming]

28:36.018 --> 28:38.542
[gasping and panting]

28:40.457 --> 28:42.024
Salomé?

28:42.068 --> 28:44.026
[gasping]
- Oh, Jesus.

28:49.205 --> 28:50.990
No.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.951
Oh, no!
[exclaiming]

28:57.561 --> 28:59.999
[groaning]
[Salomé sobbing]

29:23.762 --> 29:25.633
[soft music]

29:30.856 --> 29:33.032
[lively music]
[laughter]

29:33.075 --> 29:34.903
Welcome to the Garden of Eros!

29:34.947 --> 29:36.687
That's Shady Sadie.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.777
Her real name is Mildred.

29:38.820 --> 29:42.215
- And she just... with men...
for money?

29:42.258 --> 29:45.174
[snorting]
- Not just men. Anybody.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.960
[laughing]
Sadie!
Come show my friend a good time.

29:48.003 --> 29:51.615
- Shhh-shhh! No, no, no.
- She likes it!

29:51.659 --> 29:53.313
[laughter]

29:53.356 --> 29:55.445
- Who's your friend?
- Terrence Crenshaw,

29:55.489 --> 29:58.013
Aphrodite has alighted.

29:58.535 --> 30:02.017
- Divine hair done
by the exquisite artiste
beside you.

30:02.061 --> 30:06.456
- She insisted we have
a celebratory refreshment,
and somehow--

30:06.500 --> 30:08.894
- I insisted we come here.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.593
- Signorina Viviana Botticelli
of the Venetian--

30:12.636 --> 30:14.813
- I know
who the Botticellis are...

30:15.596 --> 30:17.337
So pleased to meet you.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.992
- C'est un plaisir.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.607
- Have I made you angry?
- No.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.219
Someday, though,
I see you will outgrow me.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.005
Then what will I do?

30:33.048 --> 30:35.181
- That will never happen, Terry.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.183
Never, ever, ever.

30:37.226 --> 30:39.011
[Terrence chuckling]

30:40.621 --> 30:42.101
[hard knocking]

30:42.144 --> 30:45.626
[man]: The gin's backstage.
You're on in 10.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.632
- Right. Fine.

30:53.329 --> 30:54.940
[sobbing]

31:03.252 --> 31:05.037
And now...

31:05.080 --> 31:07.256
for the final veil.

31:07.300 --> 31:11.130
What's she hiding...
beneath the veil?

31:15.612 --> 31:17.266
It's your prize.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.618
And now...

31:21.662 --> 31:23.272
for mine.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.710
[audience screaming]

31:29.235 --> 31:30.627
[screaming]

31:43.902 --> 31:46.208
- The body was discovered
separately

31:46.252 --> 31:48.558
in the trash bins
behind the bar.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.386
The bartender
brought them both here.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.345
- Well,
the stabbing happened first.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.956
We couldn't call the neck wound
clean, per se,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.785
but there's less bleeding
'cause he was already dead.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.744
- What does the method
of decapitation tell us?

32:00.788 --> 32:03.965
- Relatively strong killer.
A sharp knife.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.925
- What about the killer's
handedness?
- Right-handed.

32:06.968 --> 32:11.494
Both with the initial stabbing
and the sawing motion
used in the decapitation.

32:11.538 --> 32:14.584
- Maybe the killer's using
the wrong hand to...

32:14.628 --> 32:16.543
try to break the pattern,
but why?

32:18.110 --> 32:20.112
Terrence wasn't even
in the photo. I mean,

32:20.155 --> 32:22.201
all the patterns
are falling away.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.899
Listen to this.
"Off with his head;

32:24.943 --> 32:26.901
This bitch is dead.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.730
Watch who you betray,
or the Widow again will slay."

32:31.036 --> 32:34.691
- The Widow's literary skills
seem to have slipped
significantly.

32:34.735 --> 32:37.694
- Head is misspelled: h-a-e-d.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.783
Dead is misspelled similarly.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.227
[soft music playing]

32:54.450 --> 32:56.322
[door opening]
[gasping]

32:57.149 --> 32:58.498
[door closing]

32:58.541 --> 33:02.415
- My valentine has arrived!
[laughing]

33:02.458 --> 33:05.635
How naughty of you
to make me wait.
What have you brought?

33:05.679 --> 33:10.031
- Good evening, Viviana.
- Shall I sit on your knee
while I open it?

33:10.075 --> 33:12.991
- It's for Venetia. Sorry.

33:13.904 --> 33:16.864
- Oh... thank you
for returning my things.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.867
I hadn't realized I'd left them
behind this afternoon.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.043
What a ninny.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.264
- You two met this afternoon?

33:26.308 --> 33:29.181
- There's plenty there.
Get her ready.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.183
- Is this...?

33:35.665 --> 33:37.189
Excuse me.

33:46.589 --> 33:47.982
- Oh, Verdi, dear!

33:49.027 --> 33:50.680
Gather your things.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.045
- You are my guest.

34:10.525 --> 34:13.485
But you are also much more.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.487
[thunder rumbling]

34:15.531 --> 34:18.012
Let's celebrate that. Hmm?

34:21.842 --> 34:23.496
Take off your cape.

34:24.888 --> 34:27.674
You should be comfortable
in your new home.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.039
You taste sweet.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.433
Like mango.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.783
Like a fresh...

34:50.565 --> 34:52.177
...ripe mango.

34:52.219 --> 34:53.917
- You bought me.

34:54.396 --> 34:58.139
Like I was a cow or a carpet...
or a loaf of bread.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.619
- No.

35:00.228 --> 35:03.144
I saved you... from far worse.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.233
Your sisters are depraved.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.670
God knows where they might've
sent you.

35:10.238 --> 35:11.500
Now...

35:14.721 --> 35:16.984
It's time
for my thank-you gift...

35:18.159 --> 35:19.595
...Valentine Verdi.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.357
You will love me.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.752
- I cannot promise that.
- You will.

35:47.406 --> 35:50.017
May take time. I can be patient.

35:50.060 --> 35:53.020
My patience
is not without limits,

35:53.063 --> 35:54.761
but I do have some.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.636
- Then, while I have the mercy
of your grace...

36:01.550 --> 36:03.596
...could I ask you one thing?

36:03.639 --> 36:05.293
- I will not deny you.

36:06.990 --> 36:11.256
- I don't have much
in this world, Mr. Gar--
- Basil. Please.

36:11.299 --> 36:14.998
And we can change
how much you have. We will.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.830
- The thing I cherish most,

36:20.874 --> 36:24.921
the thing I have perhaps earned
most for myself...

36:26.009 --> 36:28.229
...is my virtue.
[Basil chuckling]

36:29.056 --> 36:31.232
- You're adorable.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.713
- And that is why you care
for me, is it not?

36:34.496 --> 36:36.194
Because I'm good?

36:37.543 --> 36:39.414
- That is among the reasons.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.636
- Please, Mr...

36:44.506 --> 36:45.812
...Basil.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.945
Please let me know you
a little better first.

36:49.598 --> 36:52.732
Please let me care for you
if you are so convinced
that I will.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.560
- Sweet girl,
get up off the floor.

36:54.603 --> 36:58.477
- Just a little bit of time
to adjust to the idea
is all I need.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.261
It would mean the world to me.

37:01.262 --> 37:04.222
It would be the first step
in making me love you.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.445
- I'll have Gladys
make up the spare room.

37:12.317 --> 37:13.709
For now.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.930
- Oh, I thank you so very much.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.889
Thank you.
[thunder]

37:35.253 --> 37:36.776
- Ah...

37:49.267 --> 37:51.617
Leaving so soon, Georgie?

37:52.835 --> 37:54.489
- How can you not?

37:59.842 --> 38:01.496
- This is my home.

38:03.106 --> 38:04.847
[sniffling]

38:04.891 --> 38:07.154
Or the closest I've had.

38:09.548 --> 38:11.593
Ever.
[sniffling]

38:13.595 --> 38:15.336
[sighing]

38:24.650 --> 38:26.304
- To Terrence Crenshaw.

38:28.915 --> 38:30.873
A kind-hearted rogue,

38:30.917 --> 38:32.571
a dashing gent...

38:33.920 --> 38:35.965
...everything one could want
in a man.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.931
- Salomé.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.109
Do you believe in ghosts or...

38:49.152 --> 38:51.546
demons of vengeance?

38:52.504 --> 38:54.070
[guffawing]

38:54.114 --> 38:57.422
- Jesus Christ...
- Because...

38:57.465 --> 39:01.643
who in this human realm
could've done that
to our beloved Terrence?

39:09.695 --> 39:11.349
Do you want company?

39:13.742 --> 39:15.135
- No.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.835
- Understood.

39:22.490 --> 39:26.538
Well, uh...
then I suppose I shall--

39:26.581 --> 39:29.192
- Would you just fucking leave
already?!

39:34.067 --> 39:35.721
Dissipate.

39:38.288 --> 39:39.725
- Good night.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.218
[soft, dramatic music]

40:44.616 --> 40:47.357
[Salomé]: The issue was,
she only had one hip.
- Oh.

40:47.401 --> 40:50.491
- The other was a glass bowl
surrounded in talcum.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.537
I have no idea
how she got around,

40:52.580 --> 40:54.887
but the thing was,
she was very happy,

40:54.930 --> 40:58.978
and one has to wonder
if such an ailment can actually
improve the character.

40:59.021 --> 41:00.893
You know? You never know.

41:00.936 --> 41:04.331
But we made her a drink
and we named it after her.
[laughter]

41:06.812 --> 41:10.772
The American ambassador
comes to see me
every time he's in town,

41:10.816 --> 41:12.992
and I probably shouldn't
be saying this, but...

41:13.035 --> 41:17.605
the prime minister
has also been known to, uh,
stop in to pull a pint?

41:17.649 --> 41:19.520
[laughter]

41:20.216 --> 41:23.437
- Refreshments?
- Another gin sling, girl.

41:23.481 --> 41:27.789
And let me assure you,
old Wilfie really enjoys
a dance.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.965
[Salomé laughing]
- Get it yourself.

41:32.098 --> 41:35.057
- Do the sisters Botticelli
know that this is how, uh,

41:35.101 --> 41:37.582
the help speaks
to their betters?

41:37.625 --> 41:42.456
- This is how I speak
to the whore whose john slashed
his cheek for sport.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.894
- Fetch the drink, girl.
- You are no better than me,
sir.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.593
- And don't forget the ice
this time.
- In fact,

41:48.636 --> 41:50.508
I may be better than you.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.684
I do honest work now.

41:52.727 --> 41:56.035
I don't take it up the wall
for a dime like you.

41:57.079 --> 41:59.952
[Margaret gasping]
[faint laughter]

42:02.694 --> 42:04.260
- Fetch...

42:04.304 --> 42:06.828
my... drink.

42:53.745 --> 42:55.311
Oh, God.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.243
No.

43:58.244 --> 44:00.028
Please, no.

44:15.609 --> 44:18.960
I'm here to make sure
your stay is a memorable one.

44:20.005 --> 44:22.355
I owe you, after our...

44:22.398 --> 44:24.096
unfortunate...

44:24.139 --> 44:27.273
interaction at the Botticelli
party the other night.

44:28.404 --> 44:30.929
- You said I would be treated
as a guest?

44:31.973 --> 44:34.193
- Like my guest... bitch.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.849
And you will get exactly...

44:37.892 --> 44:41.113
the hospitality
you have earned yourself.

44:41.156 --> 44:44.159
- Mr. Garvey,
if I have offended you,
I didn't--

44:45.770 --> 44:47.815
- You threatened me.

44:51.471 --> 44:54.300
[laughing]
- You're looking to me for help?

44:54.343 --> 44:56.998
- We were sisters
in earlier days.

44:57.042 --> 44:59.087
- You said you were better
than me.

44:59.740 --> 45:01.742
You certainly won't be
after this.

45:07.835 --> 45:10.969
Come in. The party's just begun.

45:33.469 --> 45:35.297
- Is this private enough
for you?

45:41.042 --> 45:42.391
Pretty girl.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.803
- Terrence?

46:02.847 --> 46:04.979
[gasping softly]

46:08.853 --> 46:10.289
Oh.

46:23.911 --> 46:25.957
- Hey, where is everybody?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.785
The place is empty.

46:27.828 --> 46:32.398
- Boss turns up murdered,
puts a little...
damper on the night.

46:32.441 --> 46:35.705
- Have you seen Salomé?
- Do I look like a nanny?

46:36.881 --> 46:40.232
- I need to see his room.
- I look like an innkeeper?

46:40.275 --> 46:43.801
Do whatever.
I couldn't give a toss.

47:37.071 --> 47:38.551
- Ah...

47:45.775 --> 47:47.212
Ah...

47:57.962 --> 47:59.398
Thank you.

48:03.358 --> 48:04.969
[sawing]

48:07.493 --> 48:09.147
It tickles.
[laughing]

48:11.497 --> 48:13.194
So strange.

48:13.238 --> 48:15.544
What are you do...?

48:16.197 --> 48:18.373
And where were you...

48:22.900 --> 48:24.249
My h-hand?

48:24.945 --> 48:26.251
Oh...

48:41.744 --> 48:43.746
[laughing]

48:48.926 --> 48:50.536
[screaming]

49:18.738 --> 49:20.783
Subtitling: difuze
