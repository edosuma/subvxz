WEBVTT

00:25.860 --> 00:28.070
(Christmas music playing)

00:34.869 --> 00:38.539
Got a feeling
that Christmas day is near

00:39.874 --> 00:43.461
and the spirit
of Santa claus is here

00:44.629 --> 00:47.131
such a wonderful time

00:47.215 --> 00:49.425
when the snow is in town

00:49.508 --> 00:51.969
it's a hell of a thrill

00:52.053 --> 00:54.680
when the sleigh bells sound

00:54.764 --> 00:56.724
what a wonderful time

00:56.807 --> 00:59.393
betcha more than a dime

00:59.477 --> 01:01.604
the city bell's gonna chime

01:01.687 --> 01:04.065
Christmas star's gonna shine

01:04.147 --> 01:06.525
and old folks singing in rhyme

01:07.318 --> 01:11.530
merry Christmas

01:21.999 --> 01:23.918
(Video continues playing)

01:35.429 --> 01:37.991
Todd: (Over voice note) Hey,
love, just a quick message to say hi.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.055
I'm sure you're getting
excited for Christmas, yeah?

01:40.810 --> 01:42.353
You better talk
to your mom, yeah?

01:42.937 --> 01:44.438
Yeah, she knows the plans.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.149
Coming! Look,
I gotta go, Gloria.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.944
I'll see you when this bloody
tour's over, darling. Bye.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.993
Hey, dad, just saying hi.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.537
Again.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.456
Can't wait to see you. Bye.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.375
Claire: Gloria!

02:05.167 --> 02:06.927
You okay, honey?
You're really quiet tonight.

02:07.962 --> 02:08.963
Gloria?

02:09.547 --> 02:12.300
I'm sorry. I've been sending
dad voice messages.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.718
He hasn't gotten back to me.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.573
His last one was, like,
two weeks ago.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.639
Well, you know what he's like
when he's on tour, honey, come on.

02:19.557 --> 02:20.558
Eat.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.060
Yeah, but he's always on tour.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.271
At least this one's
over by Christmas.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.607
What, mom?

02:30.276 --> 02:33.863
Well, your dad, he might stay in
Germany for a while after his tour is over.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.924
Gloria: But he said he'd come
back to London... (Oven beeping)

02:35.948 --> 02:38.242
And that we would
have a proper Christmas.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.994
Claire: I said he might,
Gloria, okay?

02:40.077 --> 02:44.332
Your dad, he... ow! He might
stay in Germany for a while.

02:44.457 --> 02:46.917
(Sighs) He didn't say.

02:48.419 --> 02:51.380
Of course he didn't say.
Do you guys even talk anymore?

02:52.214 --> 02:55.801
Of course we talk.
We talk all the time.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.512
There is nothing to worry
about. We're working it out.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.097
We are.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.188
Hey, you barely ate anything.
Come on. I'm not hungry, mom.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.985
(Thunder rumbling)

03:14.320 --> 03:15.404
(Sighs softly)

03:59.615 --> 04:01.283
(Wind whistling)

04:38.070 --> 04:39.405
(Engine starts)

04:54.962 --> 04:58.007
The problem is down there.
Not up here.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.842
Woman: But this is the wire.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.052
(Groans) I've checked
every single light.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.679
Woman: No, no, no. I have!

05:03.762 --> 05:07.224
Woman: Now you stay up there
and you recheck those lights.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.517
Man: Recheck the lights?

05:08.601 --> 05:10.269
Woman: Yeah. Man: No way.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.353
(Horn blares)

05:11.437 --> 05:14.023
You watch where
you're going, idiot!

05:19.111 --> 05:20.279
(Groans softly)

05:21.906 --> 05:24.158
Man: Why am I always
the one up here anyway?

05:24.241 --> 05:27.203
Woman: Come on!
Where's your Christmas spirit?

05:28.120 --> 05:31.373
Man: My Christmas spirit is at
home where I'm not being yelled at.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.292
(Christmas music playing
over stereo)

05:33.417 --> 05:36.545
Man: Wally? What's he doing
here? (Woman groans)

05:37.463 --> 05:39.590
And this. (Snorts)

05:40.257 --> 05:41.383
(Stu coughs)

05:41.467 --> 05:43.886
Iffy: Now, now, stu,
don't go dying on us.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.598
You know better than to tell
mejokes while I'm sipping coffee.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.058
(Men chuckle)

05:49.642 --> 05:52.269
This wiring is almost
as old as you, st...

05:53.979 --> 05:55.147
(Men laugh)

05:55.272 --> 05:57.149
Iffy: Whoa! Look who's here!

05:57.233 --> 05:58.776
Stu: Turn the
Christmas music off.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.486
Long time, no see, bud.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.112
Stu: Hey, bud.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.949
(Music stops)

06:07.868 --> 06:09.662
Wally: What? What you
looking at, old man?

06:10.412 --> 06:12.581
I got as much right to
be here as anybody else.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.875
Sally, show him the sign.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.335
(Snorts)

06:17.461 --> 06:20.047
That's for you, specifically.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.758
I'm sorry, Mr. Mcshane.
He just started...

06:22.841 --> 06:25.970
Sally, it's fine. Just
ring it up. I will pay.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.138
All right. Hey, that is assault!

06:28.222 --> 06:30.432
You all saw that!
That is statutory assault!

06:30.516 --> 06:32.184
Get outta here, Finn Wally.

06:32.268 --> 06:33.978
You'll regret this, mcshane!

06:34.395 --> 06:35.604
You'll regret this!

06:35.688 --> 06:37.147
Iffy: Way to go, bud.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.695
The store's closing
December 25th?

06:44.738 --> 06:45.739
Forgood?

06:46.532 --> 06:48.534
You know about this, Sally? No.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.494
How about you, tevin?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.746
Explain yourself, old man.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.624
Store's been losing
money for years.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.876
It's time to close it down.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.169
You can't do this.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.590
Betty and bud's is an
institution in this town,

07:02.673 --> 07:03.882
the heart of the community.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.086
In case you haven't noticed,

07:05.134 --> 07:06.974
Betty hasn't been around
for a couple of years.

07:07.011 --> 07:10.681
Iffy: Yeah, I know that, bud. But
there must be something we can do...

07:10.764 --> 07:11.765
There isn't.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.687
Looks like you're gonna have to get
your free coffee some place else, iffy.

07:17.688 --> 07:21.775
Sally, tevin, I'll be in
between now and Christmas.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.861
Help you close the thing down.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.824
Man: They're still not
working. I keep telling you.

07:29.325 --> 07:30.534
Woman: What are you saying?

07:30.909 --> 07:32.911
Man: What I'm saying is
there are too many lights.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.121
That's the problem.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.875
Same problem last year.
Bunch of clowns.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.794
Man: We need to take
half of these down.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.730
(Bud groans softly)

08:04.276 --> 08:05.277
Well, bet...

08:08.238 --> 08:09.281
(Voice breaks) It's done.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.499
(Huffing)

08:30.344 --> 08:31.553
Bud: Where did he come from?

08:47.111 --> 08:48.237
Damn heater.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.375
Who put up the reindeer display?

09:08.006 --> 09:09.007
Where'd you go?

09:10.175 --> 09:11.301
(Exclaims)

09:23.981 --> 09:26.275
(Groaning softly)

09:30.320 --> 09:33.198
Claire: I am sorry I am late,
honey. It has been a crazy day.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.742
What happened this time?

09:34.825 --> 09:37.995
So I finished my project
for work, which is great.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.806
That means we'll have
some money this Christmas.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.124
So we're no longer
on a limited budget.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.542
Oh, no, we're still on it.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.711
But at least now we have
a little bit of wiggle room.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.671
But then I got
a call from back home.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.590
Your grandad had an accident.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.759
He's in the hospital,
but he's gonna be okay.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.261
Okay, well, that's good.
You know what's even better?

09:55.053 --> 09:57.598
We're going to the
us. Ofa. For Christmas.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.058
(Laughs) (Sighs)

10:04.188 --> 10:05.814
I can't believe you, Gloria.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.310
We're spending the holidays
with your American family,

10:08.358 --> 10:10.986
and you're acting like I
grounded you for Christmas break.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.238
I'm sorry, but I'm not chuffed
about spending time

10:13.280 --> 10:14.782
with people I don't
even remember.

10:15.491 --> 10:16.492
(Sighs)

10:16.575 --> 10:19.036
Apart from grandad.
I remember him.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.955
He was scary.
I don't think he likes me.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.666
Of course he likes you. He can
just be kind of grumpy sometimes.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.002
Well, what if dad turns up
whilst we're in america?

10:27.419 --> 10:29.630
He won't. He's not coming
back to London for Christmas.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.816
You said might. Claire:
Well, he's not, okay. It's definite.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.300
He's spending more time
in Germany.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.718
Butwhy didn't he tell me?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.488
Because he doesn't like to be
the bearer of bad news.

10:36.512 --> 10:37.638
That always falls on me.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.269
(Sighs)

10:51.944 --> 10:53.987
You could finish these
and send them to him though.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.907
I don't even know why I
made those stupid drawings.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.118
It's not like I believe
in Santa anymore. (Sighs)

11:00.202 --> 11:02.704
Oh, honey, come here,
come here. (Kisses)

11:09.253 --> 11:11.964
(Christmas music playing)

11:14.508 --> 11:17.427
It looks a lot
like Christmas to me

11:17.511 --> 11:19.012
(song continues playing
on radio)

11:19.096 --> 11:22.683
What? I'm making a video of
our trip. Iwanna send it to dad.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.643
Oh, that is a great idea, honey.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.396
Make sure you're getting
your grandad's shop.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.690
I used to spend
so much time there.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.777
And that is where my first
boyfriend, Danny baker, asked me out.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.029
You can get back to me on that.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.698
(Chuckles)

11:37.781 --> 11:40.409
It looks a lot like Christmas
from here

11:42.703 --> 11:47.082
maybe just because
I have you near

11:47.165 --> 11:50.669
and, oh, there's not
a spot of snow

11:50.752 --> 11:53.463
not a drop of Holly or mistletoe

11:53.547 --> 11:58.510
there's a kind of magic
I can clearly see

11:59.136 --> 12:03.181
and it looks a lot
like Christmas to me

12:13.400 --> 12:16.862
Claire. Oh, it's been
so long. You look terrific.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.323
Hey, Erica. So do you.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.366
And who's this?

12:22.492 --> 12:28.165
I don't recognize you, Gloria.
You've grown so much. (Chuckles)

12:28.582 --> 12:32.127
Your cousins were so excited
when they heard you were coming.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.087
They should be home any minute.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.299
Where do I put this?
Upstairs, honey.

12:39.843 --> 12:44.723
(Sighs) She is so... cute.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.577
Bud: Bet?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.835
Claire: So, how's dad?

13:14.002 --> 13:15.087
A holy terror.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.232
He's been sleeping a lot since
he got back from the hospital.

13:18.256 --> 13:22.177
I have been trying to get him to
eat something, but he just yells at me.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.345
That sounds like dad.

13:23.679 --> 13:26.974
You would not believe the state
of this house when we got here.

13:27.432 --> 13:31.561
Itwas... (Exhales deeply)
We had to go nuclear.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.008
(Door opens) Tyler: Aunt Claire.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.650
Hi! Oh, my, you got so big,
look at you. (Chuckles)

13:36.775 --> 13:39.569
Hello, Claire. Hey.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.196
Hi, Gerry.

13:42.990 --> 13:43.991
Nice move.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.367
Oh, don't you start.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.954
Just 'cause dad mumbled something
about a reindeer causing his accident,

13:49.246 --> 13:52.082
I'm not going to apologize
for putting up that display.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.376
Claire: Gloria, come and say hi.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.669
Hey, Gloria.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.090
How's jolly old england, Gloria?

14:00.966 --> 14:02.300
(Snickers)

14:03.427 --> 14:04.845
Come on, jump in. Be quick.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.722
It's cold. Claire: I know.

14:06.805 --> 14:07.889
(Moans softly)

14:08.640 --> 14:09.641
There you go.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.022
Oh, yeah, grandad called me
bet when iwent into his room earlier.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.541
What were you doing
in grandad's room?

14:16.565 --> 14:18.483
Well, I didn't know
which room was which.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.360
But why would grandad
call me grandma?

14:20.444 --> 14:22.863
I just don't think he's feeling
himself right now, honey.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.365
Is that why there's no
Christmas decorations?

14:25.741 --> 14:29.202
No. That's because my mom
always did the decorations,

14:29.286 --> 14:33.331
and since she's been gone, I don't
think he's been feeling very christmassy.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.876
That's sad. Claire: Yeah.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.880
Wait, though.
I think I have... I remember.

14:40.005 --> 14:42.549
Gloria: Okay. Why is it
so cold in here?

14:43.425 --> 14:48.513
Because dad likes it cold,
especially at nighttimes.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.640
We used to call this place
the igloo growing up.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.102
Gloria: I see why you call it
the igloo. I feel like an ice block.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.023
Here you go.

14:59.858 --> 15:00.859
Hmm.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.489
I love you, honey.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.824
I love you more.
Not possible. Good night

15:07.908 --> 15:09.348
it is possible.
(Kissing) Good night.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.369
Good night. (Exclaims softly)

15:27.219 --> 15:29.554
Gerald: We need to talk,
about dad...

15:30.472 --> 15:31.949
Claire: Do this
in the morning, Gerry?

15:31.973 --> 15:33.850
Gerald: Look, he's not well.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.454
Claire: There's nothing
wrong with him.

15:35.519 --> 15:38.414
Gerald: How would you know? You're
never here. Claire: Oh. Okay. This again.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.999
Gerald: Do you know
how difficult it is...

15:40.023 --> 15:41.566
Claire:
This is his home, Gerald.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.652
He needs to stay in his home.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.815
Gerald: All right. Well,
so are you going to be here?

15:46.071 --> 15:47.989
It's true and you know it,
Claire.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.951
You've been home, what?
Twice in ten years?

15:51.201 --> 15:53.482
You moved to england. You
wiped your hands of this family.

15:53.537 --> 15:57.374
Gerald, come on. That's
enough. Claire just got here.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.752
All I said was, I think it's time that
dad moved to the retirement village

16:00.836 --> 16:02.379
and she jumps all over me.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.173
Like she's worried
about dad all of a sudden.

16:05.924 --> 16:09.136
Of course I'm worried about
dad. That is really offensive.

16:09.386 --> 16:13.223
We've been here, Claire. Come
in from California every year.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.267
We've seen how dad's slipped.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.978
He lives in squalor. He
forgets to take his medication.

16:18.061 --> 16:21.815
So your first thought was to
send him off to a retirement village?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.150
He would hate that.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.919
Gerald: Did Erica tell you
about all the unpaid bills

16:24.943 --> 16:25.983
we found when we got here?

16:26.027 --> 16:28.107
They were going to turn off
the gas, the electricity.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.882
Imagine if we hadn't
been here to sort that out.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.742
Dad would have frozen to death.
I'm telling you, he's not all there.

16:32.826 --> 16:37.414
Look, let's just see how
the week goes with dad.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.042
Before we leave
if we think it's necessary,

16:41.126 --> 16:43.628
we can discuss getting
some kind of help for him.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.132
See? I like Erica's plan
way better.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.302
Fine. But ifone more thing
happens with dad, just one,

16:50.635 --> 16:53.180
he's off to the retirement
home. End of discussion.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.681
Claire:
That's the spirit, Gerry.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.727
(Clinking softly)

17:04.191 --> 17:06.483
(Creaking)

17:27.130 --> 17:28.632
(Thudding)

17:35.222 --> 17:36.223
Mom?

17:36.932 --> 17:37.933
(Thudding continues)

17:58.745 --> 17:59.746
Who are you?

18:01.998 --> 18:03.083
Oh, I'm Gloria.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.380
Did you hear something
on the roof?

18:22.560 --> 18:23.687
What are you doing here?

18:25.146 --> 18:26.648
Reindeer don't live around here.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.068
I ran off the road
because of you.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.736
I got a concussion, you know.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.614
Feels like there's a
jackhammer inside my head.

18:34.698 --> 18:35.699
(Grunts softly)

18:35.782 --> 18:38.910
Bud: Do you understand what I'm
saying? Because I'm talking to you.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.913
And I assume that you do
because you do these other things.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.331
What are you doing?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.166
What are you doing?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.835
What's that deer doing?

18:47.836 --> 18:49.379
(Grunting softly)

18:51.047 --> 18:52.382
She's talking back to me.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.181
(Chuckles)

19:00.265 --> 19:01.308
Was that a reindeer?

19:07.147 --> 19:10.150
Was that a reindeer? Do you
own it? Wait, what was its name?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.402
What you mean by,
"it was talking to you"?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.612
Like, what you mean by
"ran you off the road"?

19:14.779 --> 19:15.780
Who are you again?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.742
Gloria, your granddaughter.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.454
Ah. Right. It's the accent's
throwing me off.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.332
You were a lot smaller
when I saw you last.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.667
(Chuckles) Duh.
Because I was like four.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.295
Don't go telling anyone about
that deer. You understand?

19:32.630 --> 19:35.800
Okay, okay. Jeez. I won't tell
anyone about the deer. I promise.

19:41.097 --> 19:45.352
Jingle bells, jingle bells
jingle all the way

19:45.435 --> 19:49.230
oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh

19:49.314 --> 19:52.025
hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells

19:52.108 --> 19:53.818
jingle all the way

19:54.527 --> 19:57.947
oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh

19:58.073 --> 20:00.700
ah. Dad, you're up.
That's fairly obvious, isn't it?

20:01.368 --> 20:03.328
Come on, Tyler. That's too much.

20:03.411 --> 20:04.412
Yeah, I'll take one.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.955
You want something to eat?

20:06.831 --> 20:09.042
I'm sitting at the dining
room table, Gerald,

20:09.125 --> 20:11.711
a table covered
with plates of food.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.755
Yes, I would like
something to eat.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.881
Okay.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.675
Have you said hi to your
daughter, Claire,

20:17.759 --> 20:19.719
who came all the way
from London to see you?

20:19.969 --> 20:21.429
Hi, dad. Bud: Hello, Claire.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.847
Claire: You remember Gloria?

20:23.264 --> 20:25.308
Yeah, we bumped
into each other last night.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.434
Claire: You did? When?

20:27.185 --> 20:30.355
Oh. We heard a bang on the
roof. Ltwas nothing. Don't worry.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.689
Um, nobody else heard it?

20:32.524 --> 20:34.567
Maybe it was krampus.

20:34.818 --> 20:38.029
Here we go. Haley's
favorite Christmas movie.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.781
Vveh, because if it was him,

20:39.864 --> 20:41.741
some of us aren't getting
out of here alive.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.993
I think that's enough
about krampus, Haley.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.912
Gerald: Erica, I think
the eggs are burning.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.916
Hey, where's all my stuff at?

20:50.375 --> 20:52.269
You mean the mess in the
living room and the kitchen?

20:52.293 --> 20:53.294
I had a system.

20:53.378 --> 20:56.923
But, dad, I think the most important
thing is, how are you feeling?

20:57.006 --> 20:58.007
Fine. (Cell phone rings)

20:58.133 --> 21:00.051
Um, no, I'm sorry.
I got to take this.

21:02.429 --> 21:06.099
So, dad, we're heading into town for
some last-minute Christmas shopping.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.576
Claire said she'd
look after you.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.727
That's not necessary.
I'm not an invalid.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.538
Actually, dad, you kind of are.
You just got out of the hospital.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.317
So, Gloria can stay.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.237
Gloria's ten. You need
an adult with you.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.781
I'm just going to sit here
and watch TV. What's to do?

21:22.574 --> 21:25.827
Well, if that's all he does,
then I'm fine with staying.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.412
There you go. Mm.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.621
(Coffee spills) (Groans)

21:28.746 --> 21:30.349
That's okay, dad. I'll
take care of it. No, I'll do it.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.416
I can do it.

21:31.541 --> 21:34.294
Erica, please. Leave it be! Dad.

21:43.178 --> 21:46.514
Uh, keys. Car keys. Where's
the keys? Erica: On the counter.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.640
Gerald: Thanks.

21:48.683 --> 21:49.851
Hey.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.979
You sure you're okay with
staying here with grandad?

21:53.646 --> 21:54.647
Yeah.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.108
I mean, you remember what
I said. He's not... (Sighs)

21:57.775 --> 22:00.087
He's not quite himself right
now. You understand that, right?

22:00.111 --> 22:02.155
Yeah, I know. It'll
be all right. I promise.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.491
Okay, but you call me
if you need anything.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.075
Yes yes?

22:06.618 --> 22:07.994
Yes yes?

22:08.077 --> 22:09.162
Yes okay.Hoveyou.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.580
I love you too. Bye.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.085
Gerald: Whose is this?
That's mine.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.545
Give it to me.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.881
(Car engine starts)

22:27.347 --> 22:29.766
Um, where do you think you're
going? None of your beeswax.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.685
You stay here in the nice,
warm house.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.021
This is your idea of warm?

22:35.939 --> 22:38.900
Smart-ass. I got a smart-ass
for a granddaughter.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.443
You stay.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.572
What am I to you? A dog?
Woof, woof, bark, bark.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.574
Are we actually leaving?
Hold on!

22:51.287 --> 22:53.248
I thought I told you
to stay at the house.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.601
Gloria: Well, I didn't want
to stay at the house.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.753
Bud: (Chuckles) You're like
a gnat. Just keep buzzing around.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.756
Gloria: What's wrong with you?
Why are you acting like this?

23:02.340 --> 23:04.092
Idonthke people who hover.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.511
I thought you'd be less of a
nuisance than your mother.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.113
But now I'm starting
to rethink that one.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.056
Well, I'm rethinking
agreeing to stay with you.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.100
I'd rather have been
alone this Christmas.

23:12.183 --> 23:13.935
Well, I'd rather be
back in england.

23:14.686 --> 23:15.895
(Chuckles)

23:15.979 --> 23:18.356
Well, good. Now that
we've straightened that out.

23:19.816 --> 23:20.900
Reindeer tracks.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.432
Gloria: Why are you so excited
about the reindeer anyways?

23:24.696 --> 23:26.030
Because he's an anomaly.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.323
What's that mean?

23:27.407 --> 23:30.410
Bud: That means reindeer don't
live anywhere around these parts.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.413
Don't live anywhere in the
entire United States for that matter.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.790
So then why...
Why is this one here?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.750
Yeah. That's what
I mean to find out.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.088
Look at that.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.966
He circled right back
around to my place.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.927
(Scoffs) I'll be danged.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.221
Hey, where are you going?

23:50.305 --> 23:52.765
Bud: There he is.
What's he looking for?

23:56.185 --> 23:58.271
Are you getting this?
Gloria: (Whispers) Yeah.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.774
Where's he going now?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.486
He's heading
towards my workshop.

24:06.571 --> 24:07.739
(Reindeer grunts)

24:07.822 --> 24:08.823
Wait.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.329
Grandad, I don't think
we should go in here.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.665
How old are you anyway?

24:17.999 --> 24:20.001
Seven, eight? I'm ten!

24:20.376 --> 24:23.254
Yeah, well, I've got over
seven decades on you,

24:23.671 --> 24:27.050
which means that I get to tell
you what to do, not vice versa.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.599
(Huffing)

24:49.197 --> 24:51.949
Grandad, don't. You don't
know where that deer's been.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.618
(Continues huffing)

25:03.544 --> 25:04.545
(Reindeer grunts)

25:07.298 --> 25:08.841
Bud: That guy's
looking for food.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.885
Grab that bucket
and go get some chestnuts.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.221
Are you sure you're gonna
be okay in here with him?

25:13.346 --> 25:15.807
Questions, questions,
always questions.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.226
Now get, before
I lose my temper.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.186
Hey, look what I...

26:03.229 --> 26:04.564
Grandad, guess what?

26:05.148 --> 26:08.609
I found this in the snow where
that guy was snooping around.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.407
Bud: Did you want me
to see that?

26:14.490 --> 26:15.742
(Huffs)

26:16.242 --> 26:17.243
Okay.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.622
All right. Here we go.
Now stay away from me, please?

26:22.415 --> 26:23.458
Bud: It's not here.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.586
Gerald must have thrown away
the rest of the broken parts.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.296
Come on, let's go.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.756
Vvhere? Youwlsee.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.841
But, look, what about him?

26:31.966 --> 26:33.926
Bud: Don't worry about him.
He'll be fine.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.600
Gloria: I can't believe
you brought me here, grandad.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.227
Let's just go, okay?

26:43.311 --> 26:44.562
It really stinks out here.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.440
Of course it stinks.
It's a dump.

26:48.649 --> 26:49.692
Are you gonna help?

26:50.902 --> 26:52.820
It'll go a lot faster if you do.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.365
Come on, get your hands dirty.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.118
First of all, ew.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.038
And second of all, why can't
you just make a new reindeer?

27:02.580 --> 27:05.541
Yes! Found the ass-end.
(Chuckles)

27:07.627 --> 27:09.003
Look what else I found.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.421
What is it?

27:11.172 --> 27:13.633
It's a sign from the
store right next to me.

27:14.467 --> 27:15.802
Stacey's antiques.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.970
She went under
about six months ago.

27:18.763 --> 27:19.806
Wait. Hold on. She died?

27:19.889 --> 27:22.517
No, no, her store did.
(Chuckles)

27:23.684 --> 27:25.978
Guess my sign will be
out here, too, pretty soon.

27:28.856 --> 27:29.982
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

27:31.526 --> 27:32.777
(Exclaims)

27:33.319 --> 27:34.779
Attagirl, Gloria.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.156
We'll be out of here in no time.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.451
Good, because it's
really grotty down here.

27:41.118 --> 27:44.956
"Grotty"? What is that? Some
kind of English swear word?

27:45.832 --> 27:49.544
(Giggles) Oh, yeah,
grandad. One of the worst.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.128
Oh. Oh.

28:06.269 --> 28:07.895
(Reindeer grunts)
Hey, get outta here!

28:07.979 --> 28:09.397
(Reindeer grunting)
Gloria: Jeez!

28:12.066 --> 28:13.776
Well, you scared prancer off.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.529
Oh. So he's prancer now, is he?

28:18.155 --> 28:19.490
Do you think he's coming back?

28:20.658 --> 28:21.659
I don't know.

28:26.581 --> 28:27.957
Hey, um...

28:29.876 --> 28:30.877
Gloria.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.921
Yeah, you're doing a really
great job there, you know that?

28:34.213 --> 28:37.884
Yeah. You're a good artist,
Gloria. Just like your grandma.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.053
She didn't paint this, did she?

28:41.137 --> 28:44.015
Sure did. I made them.
She painted them.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.642
So now I see why you
dragged me to the dump.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.978
Yep, had to be this deer.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.647
Come on, let's finish this up,

28:51.731 --> 28:53.451
get him back up there
with the rest of them.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.952
What is going on out there?

29:06.787 --> 29:08.247
Hey, dad!

29:12.251 --> 29:13.419
Gerald: What the...

29:15.212 --> 29:17.423
Oh, you've gotta be
kidding me. (Snickers)

29:17.632 --> 29:18.925
Gerald: Dad? Bud: Thank you.

29:19.342 --> 29:20.622
Gerald: Dad, what are you doing?

29:22.595 --> 29:23.930
Get down, dad. Come on.

29:24.138 --> 29:26.307
Let me do that. I put
them up in the first place.

29:27.058 --> 29:28.768
Get down from there, dad.
Let me do that.

29:28.851 --> 29:29.936
I'm already up here.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.707
(Panting) What's with you? Why are
you even trying to fix that blooming thing?

29:33.731 --> 29:35.816
Bet would've wanted me
to fix this guy.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.904
She surely did love
these reindeer.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.406
You knew that, Gerald.

29:42.865 --> 29:44.367
But you still threw it away.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.578
Haley: This morning grandad
was all grumpy ass. Now look at him.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.121
He's acting like a kid.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.041
It's not a bad version of
him. (Both snicker)

29:53.501 --> 29:54.502
What...

29:55.836 --> 29:57.129
It's on.

29:57.380 --> 29:58.381
Whoa! Okay?

29:58.464 --> 29:59.465
No, no, no.

30:00.341 --> 30:01.592
Gerald: Careful. Okay.

30:01.801 --> 30:02.802
It's okay.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.387
Oh, my god!

30:04.929 --> 30:05.930
Bud: I got it.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.684
There. Okay, hold the ladder.
Gerald: I got you.

30:09.767 --> 30:10.977
Bud: Thanks. Gerald: Careful.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.061
Bud: Yep.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.939
I cannot believe you let your
grandad drive to the garbage dump.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.607
I mean, what were you thinking?

30:17.274 --> 30:18.901
Ow! Mom, that really hurts!

30:18.985 --> 30:20.921
Yeah, well, I'm trying
to get the paint out, okay?

30:20.945 --> 30:22.655
And you smell
really bad, Gloria.

30:22.738 --> 30:26.033
Then maybe I could just sleep on the
sofa like you make dad do sometimes.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.335
Uh, mom, you okay?

30:37.795 --> 30:42.633
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, honey.
I'm just... I'm really tired.

30:43.092 --> 30:44.135
Jet lagged, you know.

30:45.636 --> 30:46.637
Yeah, mom?

30:47.763 --> 30:49.015
Mm-hmm.

30:49.098 --> 30:51.976
Are you and dad talking about
when he's gonna come back home?

30:53.561 --> 30:54.979
Yeah.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.981
Yeah, we're talking, honey.

30:57.940 --> 30:58.941
We are.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.794
Todd: (Over voice note) Hi,
love. Just a quick message to say hi.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.277
I'm sure you're getting
excited for Christmas, yeah?

31:05.781 --> 31:07.700
Uh, you better talk
to your mom. Yeah?

31:07.825 --> 31:09.827
Um, yeah, she knows the plans.

31:09.952 --> 31:11.712
Man: Hey, Todd, mate.
Gotta go! Todd: Coming!

31:12.329 --> 31:13.497
I gotta go, Gloria.

31:13.873 --> 31:16.375
I'll see you when this bloody
tour's over, darling. Bye.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.262
(Moans softly)

31:29.680 --> 31:31.015
Bud: First time I saw that deer

31:31.098 --> 31:33.392
was in the cemetery
when I was visiting bet.

31:34.143 --> 31:37.229
And then he flew
right over my truck.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.231
That was the cause
of my accident.

31:40.024 --> 31:41.108
He must havejustjumped.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.444
Nope. He never came back down.

31:43.944 --> 31:47.490
I looked through all my windows,
checked out the rearview mirror, nada.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.075
Pass me the turpentine,
will you?

31:53.996 --> 31:57.708
Gloria, what do you think we
heard the other night on the roof?

31:57.958 --> 32:01.504
I don't know. Some sort of
possum. Tree branch.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.799
There was nothing up there on the
roof when I shone my light up there.

32:05.424 --> 32:10.930
So, what? You're saying a
reindeer landed on your roof.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.308
(Chuckles) Come on,
grandad. I mean...

32:14.683 --> 32:15.768
You think I'm crazy?

32:16.143 --> 32:18.479
Yes! I think
you've lost the plot.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.484
Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.654
I mean, I mean, I just don't
believe in Santa anymore.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.198
So that's why
it doesn't make sense to me.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.095
Um, wait. Why are you
telling me this?

32:31.575 --> 32:33.285
You asked, for one thing.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.705
More important, you and I
are in this together.

32:36.914 --> 32:40.042
It was only the two of us who
heard that noise on the roof.

32:44.213 --> 32:47.299
Yeah, so... about that.

32:47.967 --> 32:52.680
Um, I heard uncle Gerald
talking to my mom.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.850
He thinks you should go live
in a retirement home.

33:00.062 --> 33:03.649
Right. If Gerald finds out
about that deer,

33:04.650 --> 33:08.028
that's grist for his
retirement home push.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.364
No. He won't find out
about the deer.

33:10.865 --> 33:14.076
We're in this together,
just like you said.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.327
This is our secret.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.540
Okay. Our secret.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.877
(Playing scales on piano)

33:22.960 --> 33:24.128
Gerald: We're back finally.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.714
Forgotten how slippy
those roads get.

33:27.298 --> 33:28.591
Just in time.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.092
We need those sprinkles.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.376
Gerald: Yeah, coming right up.

33:31.886 --> 33:33.095
Hey, Claire. Yeah?

33:33.179 --> 33:35.806
You will never guess who I
just bumped into on main street.

33:36.807 --> 33:37.892
Finn Wally.

33:38.017 --> 33:41.145
Oh, god, what a creep.
Is he still here?

33:41.228 --> 33:45.649
Yeah, well, regardless, he told me
he just recently came into some money.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.109
An inheritance I think.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.944
And he was asking
about the house up here.

33:49.236 --> 33:52.406
He was wondering, you know,
since the hardware store's closing...

33:53.699 --> 33:56.994
Wait. Are you saying Finn
Wally wants to buy this house?

33:57.953 --> 34:00.706
Stop it. Play something else,
will you, Tyler?

34:00.789 --> 34:03.876
It's always scales, scales,
scales. It drives me crazy.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.754
(Sighs) Why don't you go up
to your room, Haley?

34:07.004 --> 34:10.382
Or you can help out here
in the kitchen.

34:13.844 --> 34:17.598
I'm gonna go to my room and
call one of my friends. Mm-hmm.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.309
Haley: Stop it, Tyler!
Tyler: Okay, okay.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.645
Yeah. Well, anyway, uh,

34:22.728 --> 34:26.232
it's the land Finn's after.
It's good hunting land.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.212
He said he'd make
a really good offer.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.654
I can't believe you're
even considering this.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.657
Dad hates that asshole.
You should, too.

34:34.782 --> 34:36.283
(Sighs) Who's this Finn Wally?

34:36.367 --> 34:38.827
He's a hunter. That's what
he does for a living and he...

34:38.911 --> 34:41.580
Trespassed on dad's land.
I mean, this was years ago.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.123
Gerry was what, like ten?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.000
So he went out into the woods.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.168
Finn Wally wanted
to shoot a deer.

34:47.628 --> 34:50.005
He missed
and he almost hit Gerry.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.007
My god. You never told me this.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.678
Because there was nothing
to tell. Iwasn't hurt.

34:55.761 --> 34:56.960
Yeah, but you could have been.

34:57.304 --> 35:00.099
I mean, dad went ballistic
on Wally, okay.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.435
He said, "if I ever find you
here on my land again..."

35:04.144 --> 35:07.398
(Scoffs) And now,
Wally wants to buy the land?

35:07.648 --> 35:09.900
It would be wrong if I didn't
pass on the information.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.653
We need to face
facts here, people.

35:12.736 --> 35:16.031
Nothing dad has done this week has
changed my mind about his situation.

35:17.074 --> 35:20.035
We need to have a serious conversation
about what we're gonna do about him.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.496
(Door opens and closes)

35:24.123 --> 35:26.250
You all don't want
me driving, so...

35:26.792 --> 35:29.586
Gloria and me are gonna need a
ride to the store tomorrow morning.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.673
I got to take care of some
things before the store closes.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.109
Well, I can help with that, dad.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.468
No, no, no. It's okay.
I got it covered.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.531
Claire: And try to behave
yourself, you two, okay?

35:39.555 --> 35:40.556
Gloria: We will.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.519
I'm excited to see this.

35:49.148 --> 35:50.149
Grandad?

35:51.150 --> 35:54.320
This is bloody brilliant,
grandad.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.530
Isthatsupposed
to be a compliment?

35:57.156 --> 35:58.365
Well, what does it sound like?

35:58.449 --> 36:02.870
Well, whenever I hear the word "bloody"
it's usually not such a good thing.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.291
This here is curmudgeon corner.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.419
It was your grandma
who came up with that idea,

36:10.919 --> 36:13.172
to have the place for
the old timers to hang out.

36:14.006 --> 36:16.508
Is that what they call
coffin Dodgers?

36:16.592 --> 36:17.676
Bud: Never you mind.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.346
I wasn't so hot
about the idea at first,

36:20.679 --> 36:23.766
giving up valuable floor space
to a bunch of freeloaders.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.102
But your grandma,

36:27.770 --> 36:28.937
she put her foot down,

36:29.897 --> 36:33.025
and as usual,
she was right. (Chuckles)

36:33.525 --> 36:36.320
Curmudgeon corner turned
out to be a big plus for this place.

36:38.072 --> 36:40.032
I don't remember
much about grandma.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.202
Bud: Well, now, that's a shame.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.622
Your grandma was just
about the sweetest person

36:46.705 --> 36:47.915
you could ever want to meet.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.877
That's not to say she didn't
have a temper. (Chuckles)

36:52.920 --> 36:59.843
She could be fierce if you crossed
her, but always generous to a fault,

37:01.053 --> 37:03.222
and as kind as the day is long.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.017
Yup.

37:08.310 --> 37:12.940
It was two years ago, just
before Christmas that she...

37:16.735 --> 37:19.571
So, not my favorite holiday.

37:21.615 --> 37:22.658
You miss her.

37:25.953 --> 37:26.954
Yeah.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.833
You have her eyes,
you know that?

37:31.250 --> 37:32.793
Do I? We don't look alike.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.546
Without a doubt.
I look at you and...

37:35.629 --> 37:37.256
(Loud thud)

37:37.798 --> 37:38.799
Gloria: Uh...

37:39.633 --> 37:40.676
What was that?

37:40.759 --> 37:41.927
Bud: Let's go find out.

37:42.386 --> 37:44.155
Gloria: Do you think
someone tried to break in?

37:44.179 --> 37:46.181
Bud: If they did, they can
have anything they want.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.307
Gloria: Grandad.

37:48.725 --> 37:51.228
What?
Huh! What are you doing here?

37:51.311 --> 37:52.896
I thought you'd be
long gone by now.

37:53.397 --> 37:54.606
(Door opens)

37:57.985 --> 37:58.986
Hello.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.904
Bud: Uh...

38:01.947 --> 38:03.467
You stay here,
I'll go deal with Sally.

38:03.532 --> 38:04.867
No, no, no, grandad, don't.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.161
Just be nice to him.
(Prancer huffing)

38:07.244 --> 38:08.495
Gloria: No, grandad, don't!

38:08.579 --> 38:10.873
Please! Please! No!
Grandad! Grandad!

38:13.167 --> 38:14.168
Hey.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.377
(Grunting softly)

38:18.172 --> 38:19.173
Bud: Hey, Sally.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.925
Oh. Mr. Mcshane, thank god.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.219
I thought maybe someone
had tried to break in.

38:24.595 --> 38:27.097
(Thudding)
Gloria: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:27.181 --> 38:28.348
(Shushing)

38:30.350 --> 38:32.769
That's my, uh, granddaughter.

38:34.021 --> 38:36.899
(Softly) Hey, hey!
Oh, my god! Calm down.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.819
She wanted to come in
to work with me today, so...

38:41.487 --> 38:44.072
It's okay. (Shushing)

38:44.156 --> 38:46.575
Stop. Stop. Stop.

38:47.409 --> 38:50.120
No. Don't, don't. No!

38:51.330 --> 38:53.332
(Prancer grunting)

38:55.667 --> 38:58.587
She's, um, rearranging
some stuff.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.589
Bud: On the shelves.

39:01.048 --> 39:02.674
(Prancer continues grunting)

39:03.217 --> 39:05.344
Ugh! Prancer!

39:09.056 --> 39:10.432
Okay, you're probably fine.

39:10.516 --> 39:14.019
I'll come help you. It's okay,
okay. I'm going to help.

39:14.478 --> 39:16.063
All right? So...

39:16.146 --> 39:17.564
(Grunts)

39:17.648 --> 39:19.900
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

39:20.275 --> 39:21.443
Okay. All right.

39:52.849 --> 39:55.686
Hey, hey! No, no, no!

39:55.769 --> 39:56.937
(Huffing softly)

40:13.161 --> 40:16.498
Uh, Sally, could you look
under the counter for my keys?

40:16.582 --> 40:18.500
Your keys?
You dropped your keys?

40:18.625 --> 40:21.169
I dropped my keys either
there or... you lost them again?

40:22.754 --> 40:24.923
I can't see anything down here.

40:25.007 --> 40:26.300
I know. They're... are you sure?

40:26.383 --> 40:28.969
How about a little further
over? Maybe that's it.

40:32.222 --> 40:35.225
No, I don't think they're here.
I can't see them anywhere.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.811
Uh, I was going for something.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.731
Sally: Well, no. Not
down here. Nothing?

40:41.273 --> 40:43.859
Mr. Mcshane, I don't
see any keys anywhere.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.153
Oh. Oh! Uh...

40:46.236 --> 40:49.740
I'm sorry, I had them
all along. (Chuckles)

40:50.032 --> 40:51.617
Gloria: Oh, you're back.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.827
Look at this mess.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.121
(Sighs)

40:58.332 --> 41:00.959
No way!

41:02.210 --> 41:03.920
Grandad as Santa.

41:04.004 --> 41:05.881
(Chuckles) Oh.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.550
Wait, but hold on...

41:08.634 --> 41:13.055
So you're telling me
you created all this mess,

41:13.138 --> 41:17.601
almost got caught,
just to show me this?

41:19.728 --> 41:20.812
(Door opens)

41:20.937 --> 41:23.273
Whoa! Oh, hi, I'm Gloria.

41:23.357 --> 41:26.151
I'm Mr. Mcshane's granddaughter.

41:26.443 --> 41:28.737
Hey, tevin. Why are you
coming in the back way?

41:28.862 --> 41:33.992
Uh, I have to get a delivery
together for, um, Mrs. Bradley.

41:34.076 --> 41:36.703
Right. I'll tell you what,
I'll take care of it.

41:37.079 --> 41:40.123
Um, listen, it might be better if
nobody knows about the deer.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.250
I'm planning a surprise
for Christmas.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.086
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.855
Bud: Could you go out there
and get the fire started?

41:45.879 --> 41:47.172
Uh, yeah, sure.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.049
(Prancer grunting softly)

41:50.926 --> 41:54.012
Can I have the list?
Oh, and your car keys?

41:56.139 --> 41:58.392
Oh, uh, nice
meeting you, Gloria.

41:58.475 --> 41:59.768
Yeah. See ya, dude.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.479
(Speaks incoherently)

42:05.148 --> 42:06.650
(Grunts softly)

42:11.947 --> 42:13.365
Gloria: Where is he going?

42:17.244 --> 42:18.870
So what are we gonna do?

42:18.954 --> 42:20.956
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?

42:21.039 --> 42:22.874
Tevin will keep
prancer a secret.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.918
The more important question is,

42:25.001 --> 42:28.004
how did that deer get
inside of my locked store?

42:28.088 --> 42:30.006
There's got to be some
logical explanation.

42:30.090 --> 42:33.760
Oh, yeah. One of them
being prancer is magical.

42:33.844 --> 42:36.471
Prancer is not magical,
and I don't believe in him.

42:36.555 --> 42:39.349
Smart, yes. Magical, no.

42:39.433 --> 42:41.727
I think he's here for a reason.

42:41.810 --> 42:44.896
He could have left if he'd
wanted to, but he didn't.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.816
So he decided to stay,
gonna wreck your life,

42:47.899 --> 42:49.860
and then you end up
in a retirement home.

42:49.943 --> 42:52.696
You watch, that deer's
got something on his mind.

42:53.196 --> 42:55.240
Too bad he can't talk
like mister ed.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.993
Then he could tell us what
he was thinking. (Chuckles)

42:58.910 --> 43:00.704
Wait, who is mister ed? What?

43:01.830 --> 43:04.082
Am I meant to know mister ed?
Of course you are.

43:04.166 --> 43:05.459
Don't you go to school?

43:05.959 --> 43:07.878
Yeah, but we don't
learn about mister ed.

43:07.961 --> 43:10.297
Well, then there's something
wrong with your school.

43:10.380 --> 43:11.882
(Both chuckle)

43:13.467 --> 43:16.052
I had to get one more delivery
before your store closed.

43:16.136 --> 43:18.096
I was so disappointed
to hear about that.

43:18.221 --> 43:21.183
Yeah, well, we had a
good run, but it's time.

43:21.266 --> 43:24.060
I have such fond memories
of shopping at your store.

43:24.603 --> 43:27.773
Betty, she was always
such a hoot.

43:27.856 --> 43:29.941
Yeah, she surely
could make people laugh.

43:30.817 --> 43:32.068
Unlike yours truly.

43:32.152 --> 43:33.737
Oh, you're not so bad.

43:33.820 --> 43:37.574
You might think you are, but your
bark was always worse than your bite.

43:39.576 --> 43:40.744
All done.

43:40.827 --> 43:43.163
I think you deserve a hot
chocolate for that, Gloria.

43:43.246 --> 43:44.247
Oh, yes, please.

43:44.331 --> 43:46.100
Bud: No, we've got
to get on back to the store.

43:46.124 --> 43:50.378
Oh. Coffee for you maybe,
Thomas? Bud: Um, thanks. But no.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.673
Come on, Gloria,
let's skedaddle.

43:54.382 --> 43:55.425
Bye-bye.

43:58.553 --> 43:59.638
She's nice.

44:00.430 --> 44:03.308
I think she thinks
you're nice too.

44:03.391 --> 44:05.018
Oh, stop it, Gloria.

44:06.019 --> 44:07.562
What's that supposed to mean?

44:08.021 --> 44:10.398
Grandad, I saw the way
she looked at you.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.945
She likes you.
Get in the car, Gloria.

44:16.655 --> 44:20.617
Nancy and I have known
each other a long time,

44:20.826 --> 44:22.661
going all the way
back to high school.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.789
Nancy? Ooh!

44:26.206 --> 44:27.833
What is wrong with you?

44:28.375 --> 44:29.668
We're friends.

44:30.293 --> 44:32.629
We've always been
nothing but friends.

44:33.296 --> 44:36.132
Whatever you say... Thomas.

44:47.060 --> 44:50.272
Hey, your son tell you
about my offer?

44:51.356 --> 44:53.775
I want to buy your
house, old man.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.946
Figured with the store closing
you'd be off to some old age home.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.782
Oh, grot you! Come on, Gloria.

45:00.866 --> 45:02.075
"Grot" me?

45:03.994 --> 45:05.620
Come on. Some nice old age home.

45:06.037 --> 45:09.541
Um, grandad, um... "Grot you"?

45:11.209 --> 45:13.587
Yeah, I didn't want to say
the other thing in front of you.

45:13.879 --> 45:15.106
Oh, no, no, no.
(Wally yelling indistinctly)

45:15.130 --> 45:17.257
I didn't mean "grot"
as like a swear word.

45:17.340 --> 45:19.551
I meant it being,
like, dirty or gross.

45:19.718 --> 45:23.847
Yeah. Well, that stupid idiot
doesn't know that, does he?

45:24.180 --> 45:25.223
True.

45:25.307 --> 45:27.976
But I've still got so many
questions. Who is that guy?

45:33.148 --> 45:35.567
Man: Hey, Gloria. Mine
will have two sugars, please.

45:36.526 --> 45:37.986
Just like Betty's back.

45:38.737 --> 45:39.821
(Chuckles)

45:40.697 --> 45:42.490
Save me one of those cookies.

45:43.366 --> 45:44.618
(Men laughing)

45:45.452 --> 45:48.246
No, no, no. You've
had, like, 50 today.

45:48.330 --> 45:50.248
No, I know that one.

45:55.003 --> 45:56.630
(Customers laughing)

46:12.479 --> 46:17.400
Gloria, unlike hanging around
this guy, it's been a pleasure.

46:17.484 --> 46:19.778
Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Yeah.

46:20.153 --> 46:21.905
See you, guys see you later.

46:21.988 --> 46:24.532
Gloria: Oh, and tevin.
Don't spoil our surprise.

46:24.616 --> 46:27.369
Hlflflnkaboutw no, no,
no, no. You think about it.

46:30.246 --> 46:32.582
Hey, honey. How did it go?

46:32.666 --> 46:35.210
Really, really good.
Yeah. I enjoyed it.

46:37.754 --> 46:40.465
Good, yeah. I'm tired.

46:41.466 --> 46:42.509
Butgood.

47:17.293 --> 47:18.837
(Creaking)

47:21.172 --> 47:22.841
(Wind whistling)

47:26.678 --> 47:27.971
(Thudding)

47:53.079 --> 47:56.249
Prancer! What are you doing?
Why are you here?

47:56.332 --> 47:58.572
Why are you in our kitchen?
And why are you in our house?

48:00.754 --> 48:02.714
(Prancer grunts softly)
(Shushing)

48:02.797 --> 48:04.674
What are you doing?

48:04.758 --> 48:08.011
If this is some sort of midnight
snack, you should not have fruit.

48:10.680 --> 48:11.848
Stop that.

48:11.931 --> 48:14.559
Why are you so loud
when you chew apples?

48:20.023 --> 48:22.734
Excuse me. Where do you
think you're going?

48:25.904 --> 48:27.072
Please.

48:27.989 --> 48:29.157
What?

48:30.158 --> 48:33.036
What... what...
What do you want from me?

48:36.456 --> 48:38.750
You want me to follow you?

48:40.752 --> 48:41.878
What?

48:41.961 --> 48:44.964
No way. This is
bonkers, prancer.

48:46.591 --> 48:48.009
Yeah. I'm not gonna follow you.

48:48.093 --> 48:50.595
I am not gonna follow you.

49:13.201 --> 49:15.495
(Prancer grunting softly)

49:19.290 --> 49:20.542
Gloria: Prancer.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.585
Prancer, where are you?

49:23.336 --> 49:24.796
Goldang it.

49:28.800 --> 49:31.678
Gloria: Prancer,
this is not funny.

49:33.263 --> 49:34.848
This was a bad idea.

49:35.765 --> 49:38.685
You wanted me to follow you,
and I'm freezing out here.

49:39.811 --> 49:41.271
Where are you?

49:43.231 --> 49:45.066
This isn't funny anymore.

49:45.150 --> 49:46.860
(Owl hooting)

49:46.985 --> 49:49.696
Okay, I'm not getting eaten.
I'm out of here.

49:49.779 --> 49:50.989
(Chittering)

49:52.907 --> 49:54.159
Gloria: Prancer!

50:07.672 --> 50:09.215
(Door opens and closes)

50:18.641 --> 50:20.059
Ugh.

50:24.022 --> 50:25.315
(Yells)

50:32.989 --> 50:34.073
Bud: Gloria.

50:34.324 --> 50:35.408
Gerald: Oh, dad.

50:37.368 --> 50:41.164
Why listen to Gerald? This
wouldn't happen in a retirement home.

50:41.247 --> 50:42.749
What do I know, huh?

50:42.832 --> 50:43.958
What do I know?

50:44.375 --> 50:46.377
(Animals howling in distance)

50:52.300 --> 50:54.552
(Prancer grunting in distance)

50:57.639 --> 50:59.515
(Continues grunting)

51:04.020 --> 51:05.396
Where have you been?

51:06.022 --> 51:08.024
So now you've finally arrived.

51:10.109 --> 51:12.987
(Giggling) Stop it! Stop it!
What are you even doing?

51:19.994 --> 51:21.287
Oh, dad.

51:24.916 --> 51:27.126
(Chuckung)

51:29.045 --> 51:31.005
Bud: Gloria. What's going on?

51:31.089 --> 51:32.215
Why didn't you wake me?

51:32.882 --> 51:36.094
Oh, prancer came to the house.
He wanted to show me something.

51:36.177 --> 51:40.223
So you came out here in the woods
all by yourself to see what it was?

51:42.225 --> 51:43.268
Well...

51:49.482 --> 51:51.693
(Gloria and bud
talking in distance)

51:55.530 --> 51:57.198
Gerald: Get a load
of this, Claire.

51:57.573 --> 51:59.784
Gloria: No wonder
the house is freezing.

52:00.493 --> 52:02.412
Bud: What are you trying
to tell us, prancer?

52:07.750 --> 52:09.002
(Grunting softly)

52:11.129 --> 52:12.547
Come on, grandad.

52:12.672 --> 52:14.424
Oh! What's going on with you?

52:14.882 --> 52:16.509
I tripped, fell.

52:16.592 --> 52:17.802
I'm all right. Come on.

52:17.885 --> 52:19.429
No, no. Come on.

52:19.512 --> 52:21.352
Let's go back to the house.
Get some ice on it.

52:21.431 --> 52:22.640
But prancer?

52:22.724 --> 52:25.143
Bud: We won't be able to
follow you tonight, prancer. Sorry.

52:25.226 --> 52:27.270
Going to have to come
back tomorrow.

52:27.770 --> 52:28.980
See you.

52:29.605 --> 52:31.316
(Animal howls in distance)
(Gasps)

52:35.820 --> 52:37.613
(Prancer grunts) (Exclaims)

52:43.036 --> 52:44.370
No, not the phone.

52:45.955 --> 52:47.415
(Prancer huffs)

52:50.418 --> 52:51.778
Gerald: She'll be down
in a second.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.256
(Both slurp)

52:56.841 --> 52:58.843
You sure you don't want
some hot cocoa, son?

52:59.302 --> 53:00.928
Looks like you need warming up.

53:04.098 --> 53:06.225
What is going on? Sit, please.

53:07.977 --> 53:12.940
Just now, I found these two in the
woods conversing with a reindeer.

53:14.025 --> 53:15.610
Reindeer? What are you
talking about?

53:15.693 --> 53:18.529
The animal attacked me
and did this to my phone.

53:18.613 --> 53:20.990
The animal did not
attack you, ger.

53:21.366 --> 53:22.367
Claire: Dad?

53:23.034 --> 53:24.744
Do you want to explain
what's going on?

53:26.329 --> 53:27.372
Gloria?

53:30.249 --> 53:32.460
Fine. Give us the silent
treatment.

53:33.211 --> 53:36.798
Butjust so you know, first thing
tomorrow I'm calling Finn Wally.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.091
No, you're not, son.

53:38.174 --> 53:39.550
Who is Finn Wally?

53:39.634 --> 53:42.428
He's the jerk we ran into
outside of the store.

53:42.512 --> 53:44.430
Gerald: Deer are not
aggressive like that, dad.

53:44.514 --> 53:45.681
You know that, right?

53:45.807 --> 53:47.183
There's something wrong with it.

53:47.266 --> 53:50.395
I mean, you've heard the
reports. Bubonic plague.

53:50.478 --> 53:53.189
That's what some of the
animals in the woods are carrying.

53:53.272 --> 53:54.625
I heard it on the news
this morning.

53:54.649 --> 53:57.819
That deer does not
have bubonic plague.

53:57.902 --> 54:00.822
How do you know? Because
it's not the 14th century, Gerry.

54:03.074 --> 54:04.158
Look, Gerald,

54:04.826 --> 54:09.580
if you call Finn Wally, the two of us
are going to have a really big problem.

54:11.749 --> 54:12.792
I'm tired.

54:13.418 --> 54:14.502
I'm going to go to bed.

54:19.382 --> 54:22.885
This is all really strange. I mean, I
can't even... (Exhales deeply)

54:22.969 --> 54:25.364
Let's just deal with it tomorrow,
when we've all had some sleep.

54:25.388 --> 54:26.389
Gerald: Fine with me.

54:26.889 --> 54:29.475
You... you're grounded.

54:29.976 --> 54:33.271
Oh, great! I'm off
to child prison again.

54:36.065 --> 54:37.692
(Wind whistling)

54:57.545 --> 55:00.006
Oh, my gosh! Guys, wake up!

55:00.089 --> 55:02.758
It snowed last night!
Tyler, wake up!

55:04.302 --> 55:05.386
Gerald: Psychotic deer...

55:06.721 --> 55:07.847
Middle of the night...

55:08.306 --> 55:11.476
What is he up to? Haley: Is
he actually talking to himself?

55:12.560 --> 55:13.978
Gerald: Dad has gone crazy.

55:20.109 --> 55:21.903
(Grunts and exclaims)

55:21.986 --> 55:23.321
(Laughing)

55:25.114 --> 55:27.158
Haley: Oh, mom, help him up.

55:28.326 --> 55:29.744
Need a hand, dad?

55:30.578 --> 55:31.579
(Sighs)

55:37.835 --> 55:38.836
(Knock at door)

55:40.671 --> 55:43.299
(Chuckles) What are you
doing up here?

55:43.382 --> 55:44.759
How come you're not downstairs?

55:45.593 --> 55:47.386
Oh. Mom grounded me.

55:47.470 --> 55:48.554
What for?

55:49.180 --> 55:51.057
Did you crack? What?

55:51.265 --> 55:53.142
After I left, they gave
you the third degree.

55:53.226 --> 55:54.995
So did you crack?
Did you tell them everything?

55:55.019 --> 55:56.479
Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.

55:56.604 --> 56:00.107
Ah! Attagirl. Way to go.
(Chuckles)

56:01.108 --> 56:05.112
Oh, did Gerald call that git, Finn
walrus? Oh, no, no, no, Finn Wally?

56:05.196 --> 56:06.614
Bud: Wally doesn't have a phone.

56:06.697 --> 56:09.909
Gerald's going to drive over to
his place after he digs out his car.

56:10.701 --> 56:11.981
I wanted to have it
out with him,

56:12.036 --> 56:14.914
but evidently we're not
speaking at the moment.

56:15.540 --> 56:18.960
So what should we do? We
can try and protect prancer?

56:19.460 --> 56:22.296
I think that deer can
probably take care of himself.

56:23.297 --> 56:27.510
What's more important is that
the two of us get our ducks in a row.

56:28.219 --> 56:29.720
And I got my duck.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.890
Whoa, you've got a pet duck?
Bud: No, no, no.

56:33.099 --> 56:36.143
I mean, I think I know
why prancer is here.

56:36.602 --> 56:38.312
He wants me to keep
the store open.

56:38.521 --> 56:40.856
That's why he was there
yesterday, to tell me that.

56:41.357 --> 56:42.441
And?

56:42.525 --> 56:44.777
Ah, I'm not sure,

56:44.860 --> 56:50.866
but I think maybe there's some kind of
connection between prancer and bet.

56:52.326 --> 56:54.245
Why? Bud: I don't know exactly.

56:54.370 --> 56:57.790
Uh, not everything in life has
a logical explanation, Gloria.

56:57.873 --> 56:59.917
Some things you just feel.

57:01.502 --> 57:03.671
Yeah, I understand. Bud: Hmm.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.798
But why did you close
the store in the first place?

57:05.881 --> 57:10.469
Well, when me and bet ran
the store together, we were...

57:12.096 --> 57:13.389
We were like this.

57:14.140 --> 57:15.349
We were magic.

57:17.435 --> 57:23.524
After she passed, I just
gradually lost interest in everything.

57:23.608 --> 57:26.986
I stopped paying the mortgage.
The bank finally forced my hand.

57:27.111 --> 57:28.529
What can you do about that?

57:28.904 --> 57:31.616
Um, I don't know, really.

57:32.575 --> 57:33.868
Something will turn up.

57:34.493 --> 57:36.662
In the meantime,
I'm going to go downstairs

57:36.746 --> 57:39.540
and have a word with your
mother and see if I can't spring you.

57:40.291 --> 57:41.834
(Chuckles) Okay.

57:52.303 --> 57:54.180
Erica: Oh, my god! (Laughing)

57:54.722 --> 57:57.350
Gerald: That's not funny.
Erica: Pretty funny.

58:00.603 --> 58:03.147
Gerald: Could've hurt myself.
Erica: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

58:07.151 --> 58:09.320
(Family continues laughing)

58:14.533 --> 58:17.161
I know I used to ground you
when you were a kid.

58:17.995 --> 58:20.706
But you did some really
stupid stuff back then.

58:20.873 --> 58:24.543
Stupider than sneaking out in the
middle of the night to talk to a reindeer?

58:26.754 --> 58:27.755
(Sighs)

58:31.842 --> 58:32.968
Claire: Kids, huh?

58:33.386 --> 58:35.221
They sure do change you,
don't they, dad?

58:36.263 --> 58:37.264
Mm-hmm.

58:39.767 --> 58:41.227
Gloria made me grow up.

58:43.062 --> 58:44.230
I had to.

58:45.773 --> 58:46.774
Hey.

58:49.068 --> 58:50.194
Hey, what's going on?

58:52.071 --> 58:54.615
I'm... I'm a mess
right now, dad.

58:55.241 --> 58:57.326
Uh-huh. And?

58:57.493 --> 58:59.412
And you don't want
to hear about it.

58:59.745 --> 59:01.956
Come on, Claire. It's me.

59:03.582 --> 59:04.709
You're my daughter.

59:11.382 --> 59:15.761
Everything you warned me
about Todd, it came true.

59:19.390 --> 59:20.516
Everything.

59:21.851 --> 59:22.893
There, I said it.

59:23.310 --> 59:24.812
You can say, "I told you so."

59:25.563 --> 59:27.356
Okay. I told you so.

59:28.733 --> 59:29.734
Yeah.

59:31.026 --> 59:32.611
You two guys splitting up?

59:34.029 --> 59:35.656
Oh, he moved out months ago.

59:35.740 --> 59:38.909
Gloria thinks we're still gonna
get back together, but that is...

59:40.286 --> 59:41.704
That's not going to happen.

59:42.705 --> 59:44.498
I'm so worried about her dad.

59:45.416 --> 59:47.710
Because he was never
a good father.

59:47.793 --> 59:50.629
But Gloria, she really,
really loves him and...

59:52.423 --> 59:55.134
And she can't understand why
he doesn't want to see her more

59:55.217 --> 59:57.970
when he comes to London
and it's breaking her heart.

59:58.387 --> 59:59.513
I'm sure it is.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.310
Look, Claire. Um...

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:09.273
This is not the most exciting
town in the world... (Chuckles)

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:10.983
And it certainly isn't London,

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.195
but it's still your home.
(Sniffles)

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:17.323
And you're always welcome.

01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:22.328
Yeah.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:25.581
Yeah.

01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:32.713
Gloria can come down at noon.

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:35.925
Sentence served?

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:37.510
Sentence served.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:56.195
(Engine powers down)

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.167
Wally: So is he going to sell?

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.711
Gerald: I'm not here about that.

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:14.463
I got a job for you.

01:01:15.256 --> 01:01:16.298
Wally: What kind of a job?

01:01:17.508 --> 01:01:18.509
What do you think?

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:24.348
Two hundred bucks a day.

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:29.270
All right. Plus expenses.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.437
Expenses?

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:35.401
Ammunition, food, butane gas
if I have to camp out overnight.

01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:39.113
I stay out until I get
the job done, mcshane.

01:01:39.947 --> 01:01:42.491
All right. All right,
you're hired.

01:01:42.575 --> 01:01:44.618
What am I hunting?
Gerald: Reindeer.

01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:47.121
Reindeer?

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:48.701
Gerald: That's what I said.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.376
I get to keep the antlers.

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.170
Kids!

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:56.255
Gerald: It's done.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.299
Finn says I'm doing
the right thing.

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:00.009
Animals are territorial.

01:02:00.259 --> 01:02:01.677
That reindeer will keep
coming back

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.512
if I hadn't hired him
to take care of it.

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:04.889
I think it's odd, ger.

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:08.017
You wanting to hire a man
who almost shot you?

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.019
Well, Finn's the best
in the area.

01:02:10.603 --> 01:02:12.771
And he agrees the reindeer
might be diseased.

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:17.067
Look, if I've got to be the bad
guy to protect everyone, so be it.

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:20.946
Is that the only reason you're
doing this, to protect everyone?

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:22.823
What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:23.532 --> 01:02:29.788
You just seem so angry
at your father.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:32.625
I'm not angry.

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:35.085
I'm just concerned.

01:02:36.879 --> 01:02:38.255
I mean, come on, Erica.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.786
He's out in the middle of
the night talking to a reindeer.

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:42.801
You know, that's like...

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:47.765
He needs care.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:52.269
He needs to be in a place
where he's taken care of.

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:12.081
(Crow cawing)

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:24.385
Oh. There you are.

01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:27.614
How come you're not out there
sledding with everyone else?

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.431
I told them they
shouldn't go sledding.

01:03:30.099 --> 01:03:31.475
Not with that deer.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.812
(Chuckles) Painted yourself
into a corner, did you?

01:03:35.396 --> 01:03:37.272
Oh, come on, ger,
don't be like that.

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:38.941
Come on, have a seat.

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:40.504
I want to talk to you
about something.

01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:46.156
I... I could really
use your help.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.464
Gerald: And what do you
need my help with?

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:52.079
I need you to go down to the
store and have a look at the books.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.497
Bring them home if you have to.

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:56.834
Because you're the accountant.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:04:00.379
I need you to help me figure
out a way to keep the store open.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.631
But dad... no.

01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:05.759
Closing the store is
absolutely the right thing to do.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:12.016
So you can ship me off to pine
grove, where everybody's all happy.

01:04:13.726 --> 01:04:15.185
I'm not going there, ger.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.604
I really love this house.

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:22.067
And itwould kill me having to be
put in a place like that and you know it.

01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:24.778
So please, help me
with the store.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.507
Dad, you're not really feeling
like yourself right now.

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:28.615
You know that, right?

01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:32.161
All this stuff with the deer.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:34.496
(Sighs)

01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.226
This is the first time you've ever
asked my help with something,

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.251
you know that?

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:42.755
Bud: No. Really?

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.007
His thatsnotnght

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:49.762
well, uh... I mean, you know,

01:04:49.845 --> 01:04:52.890
you left home
at a very young age.

01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:55.267
You met Erica,
made a life for yourself,

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.911
and a very good life
and I'm proud of you.

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:58.604
I'm talking about
when I was a kid.

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:00.731
A kid?

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.233
(Chuckles) Jeez.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.819
I just always assumed
that you wanted to go off

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:07.780
and do your own thing
with your friends.

01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:09.740
Yeah, well...

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:14.620
Amazing how often parents and kids
don't know what the other one's thinking.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:18.791
I would have loved it

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:23.587
if you'd have asked for my help
around here or in the workshop.

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:34.973
Look, ger. I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry, okay?

01:05:35.808 --> 01:05:38.018
I know I can be
closed off sometimes.

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:42.898
I just go into my own world, and
I don't want to let anyone else in.

01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:51.281
But, right now, at this very
moment, I am asking for your help.

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:56.745
I need to keep
the store open, ger.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:58.872
As long as I possibly can.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.126
Gerald: Okay, dad.

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:05.129
I'll go get the books.

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:09.007
But don't get your hopes up.
Oh...

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:20.602
Haley: It was so much easier
when I was sliding on my butt!

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:23.689
(All laughing)

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.400
Claire: Give me your hand.
Come on!

01:06:26.525 --> 01:06:28.944
Erica: Kids, you got to stay
on your feet. Stay on your feet!

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:33.699
Haley: That was so cool.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.160
Get to the fire swiftly.
I am freezing.

01:06:36.243 --> 01:06:38.078
Yeah, it's very cold.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:40.664
That was amazing.

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.082
Gloria: That was my first time.

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:44.046
Haley: Really? You're amazing
for a first timer.

01:06:44.293 --> 01:06:46.420
Cool, retro games.

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:48.547
Come on.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:49.756
Come on.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.049
(All cheering)

01:06:52.718 --> 01:06:53.927
So done.

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:56.847
Go on, get outta here!
Walk of shame, brother.

01:06:57.055 --> 01:06:59.266
Sorry. I'm out here!

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:02.436
I'm done, too. You guys
can divvy up my stake.

01:07:02.728 --> 01:07:04.354
Oh, no, grandad, stay.

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:06.106
You just want to take me
to the cleaners.

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:07.399
Yeah. Very funny.

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.359
I'm gonna go up and see
how Gerald is doing,

01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:10.723
and them I'm gonna hit the sack.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:13.030
Gloria: Okay, so
it's rnyturntoroh. Yeah.

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:14.489
Hey, dad? Bud: Hmm?

01:07:14.615 --> 01:07:17.910
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, sure. Of course I am.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:19.828
This is great, huh?

01:07:19.912 --> 01:07:21.622
All of us here together.

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:24.583
Feels like... home.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.168
(Chuckles softly)

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:28.688
Gloria: Okay, so whose turn?
'Cause they landed on my property.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.047
You stop trying to take my cash.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.590
Bud: Everybody okay with this?

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:34.748
Gloria: (Hesitates) Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.428
Good. Night.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:37.512
Claire: Good night.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:41.683
(Playing scales)

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:43.644
Oh, no. He's not...

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:45.604
I'm gonna go to bed.
Okay, good night.

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:46.688
Good night.

01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:56.657
(Snoring softly)

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:01.954
(Prancer grunting in distance)

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.622
(Engine running)

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:10.671
(Pranchrconflnuesgrunflng) Hmm?

01:08:11.505 --> 01:08:13.131
Bud: You know what time it is?

01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:15.509
(Engine running)

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:21.348
God damn it.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.564
Grandad, what's going on?

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:34.694
What's going on is that deer needs to
stop showing up in the middle of the night.

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:35.946
It's exhausting.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.240
Okay, then why are you out here?

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.743
This snowmobile was running
when I came out here.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.180
Prancer did this.
(Engine powers down)

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:48.207
(Chuckles) Come on, grandad!

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:50.252
Last night, he wanted you
to follow him.

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:52.671
I told him to come back
tomorrow, so he did.

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.840
And he started the snowmobile.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.385
Go back in the house, then.
I'll tell you what's happening.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.386
No, I'm not going back
in the house.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.640
If you're going out to look for
prancer, I should be with you.

01:09:03.724 --> 01:09:05.892
You got hurt last night
following prancer.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.620
What do you think your
mother would say to me

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.229
if I told her I was taking you
back out there again tonight?

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:13.984
I don't care. Prancer wants me
to follow him, not you.

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:18.613
So you jump on the snowmobile
and go find out what he wants, yourself.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:24.411
(Engine running)

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.288
Hold on tight, you hear?

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.207
Both hands.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.845
Gloria: Grandad, I can't
see him anywhere.

01:09:45.432 --> 01:09:47.059
Grandad, over there!

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:48.852
(Bellows)

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.479
You holding on tight?

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:51.563
Okay.

01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:53.148
Let's do it.

01:09:54.358 --> 01:09:55.734
Gloria: Faster, faster!

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:58.528
Over there!

01:10:04.493 --> 01:10:05.494
(Gasps)

01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:21.176
(Sighs) Erica!
They're at it again!

01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:39.611
Whoo-hoo!

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:40.695
Hold on.

01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:42.280
(Prancer bellows)

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:54.709
(Chuckung)

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.461
Gerald: I knew
I heard something.

01:10:56.545 --> 01:10:57.796
Erica: What's going on?

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:00.298
Gerald: Dad and Gloria have
gone out on the snowmobile.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:03.218
I'm going to go find them.
In the middle of the night?

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:04.862
I'll check Gloria's phone.
I'll come too.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.054
No, you are not.

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:08.598
Well, I can't believe Gloria
gets to go on a midnight ride

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.559
on the snowmobile with grandad.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.102
(Door closes) Ugh!

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:14.354
Bed. Good night!

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.865
(Grunting)

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:33.957
Hey, prancer, watch out!

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.792
(Prancer bellowing)

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:41.882
(Horn honking)

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.436
(Exclaims)

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:56.897
Hey, you almost ran him over.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.356
Sorry I missed him.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:00.692
Damn you, mcshane!

01:12:01.276 --> 01:12:02.277
(Grunting)

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:07.157
Prancer, the car!

01:12:12.204 --> 01:12:13.538
(Prancer bellows)

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.964
Uh, grandad, why did he
bring us here? I don't know.

01:12:33.225 --> 01:12:35.018
Hold on. Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.311
Isure am.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.232
It's a party, grandad.

01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:42.943
Get closer, grandad, closer!

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:44.611
(Engine revs)

01:12:45.362 --> 01:12:47.113
Hold on! Gloria!

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:51.076
(Groans)

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.043
Gloria!

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:04.422
Gloria.

01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:07.175
Gloria.

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:10.971
Oh, no.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:16.184
Oh, no. No.

01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:20.355
No. Please, god. No.

01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:22.857
Grandad, I filmed it.
I filmed it.

01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:23.984
Where's my phone?

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:25.777
No, no. Don't move.
Don't move, please.

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:27.713
Grandad, we've got to
show it to Gerald. Don't move.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:30.657
Now they're gonna believe
you. All right. I'll go look. Okay.

01:13:32.284 --> 01:13:33.952
No, no. Stay down.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:35.304
What'd I tell you?
It's okay, grandad.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:36.663
I'm just a little shook up.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.206
Well, listen to me. Gloria: Mom.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.336
Gloria.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.047
You've really gone off the
deep end this time, dad, huh?

01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:48.425
Are you hurt? Are you sure?
No, but we saw a reindeer.

01:13:48.508 --> 01:13:50.552
She was... she was leaning
out of the...

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:54.055
No, no. You are the last person
I want to see right now, dad.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.517
What were you
thinking, dad, huh?

01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:00.020
Putting her on the back.
Why were you...

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:02.439
The reindeer followed us.
(Shushes)

01:14:02.522 --> 01:14:04.482
Are we still with this deer?
Come on.

01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:07.527
I didn't believe him until just
now. Believe him about what?

01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:08.612
That deer is magical.

01:14:08.695 --> 01:14:11.323
And why is nobody
listening to me?

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:12.490
It's on the phone.

01:14:12.574 --> 01:14:13.575
Claire: You know what?

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.369
I have heard enough
about the reindeer, Gloria.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:18.705
In the car.
But, grandad, you know...

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.123
(Muffled)

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:22.250
Gerald: Get in the car, dad.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.211
Gloria: (Crying)
It's on the phone.

01:14:29.549 --> 01:14:30.592
Gerald: Come on, dad.

01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:42.604
(Indistinct)

01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:52.739
(Cell phone chimes)

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.561
Gloria: Grandad. Bud: Hmm?

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:26.272
What time is it?

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:28.817
Early, but shouldn't
we be going to the store?

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.860
People will think
it's closing after Christmas.

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.737
It is. Gloria: What?

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:36.116
What are you talking about? The
store is closing after Christmas.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:40.495
You all are leaving, and I'm
probably headed off to pine grove.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:43.748
Oh, come on, grandad,
snap out of it. That's rubbish.

01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:47.627
That's just it.
I have snapped out of it.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.047
Must've been out of my mind
these last few days.

01:15:51.923 --> 01:15:54.050
Hopefully it's only
temporary insanity.

01:15:54.134 --> 01:15:56.010
You're not insane, grandad.

01:15:56.094 --> 01:15:58.012
And I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

01:15:58.096 --> 01:16:00.807
And that's why prancer
took us to town last night.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.350
To show us those lights.

01:16:02.434 --> 01:16:03.893
So I'd believe like you.

01:16:03.977 --> 01:16:05.395
I do now. I really do.

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:09.190
Gloria, forget about that
deer. Okay? And the store.

01:16:09.274 --> 01:16:11.043
No, I am not going to forget
about the deer and the store.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.627
You're the one who
dragged me into this.

01:16:12.694 --> 01:16:14.755
We almost finished... your
mother was right, you know.

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:16.614
You could've been hurt
real bad last night.

01:16:16.698 --> 01:16:19.242
But I wasn't.
No. But you could have been.

01:16:20.452 --> 01:16:22.662
You're not listening to me.
You listen to me!

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:24.831
It's over. You understand?

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:26.750
Over. But what about...

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:29.335
I don't want to hear another
word about that deer.

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:46.853
(Sobbing)

01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:46.079
(Whispers)
Hey, guys, are you awake?

01:17:48.039 --> 01:17:50.750
(Loudly) Hello!
Oh, my gosh! Gloria.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.168
What's going on?

01:17:52.252 --> 01:17:54.420
Mom and dad aren't telling
me and Tyler anything.

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.464
Okay, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.

01:17:56.548 --> 01:17:58.591
But you've just got to help
me with something first.

01:17:58.675 --> 01:18:01.052
Yes, of course.
Tell me everything.

01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:03.513
Gloria: Okay, so there's
this reindeer, like an actual one.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:05.056
And it flew over
grandad's truck.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.182
And then, last night...

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:13.314
Showtime.

01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:15.441
(Crows cawing)

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:19.946
Gerald: Dad's not coming out
of his room, then, huh?

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.197
Nope.

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:24.200
We knocked on his door and he
said hejust wanted to be alone, so...

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:26.619
(Phone rings)

01:18:27.579 --> 01:18:29.706
Hello? Sally: Hi, this is Sally.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:31.624
Can lspeak to Mr. Mcshane?

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.908
He can't come to the phone
right now, Sally. Can I help?

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.880
Oh. Um, it's about this video.

01:18:36.963 --> 01:18:39.507
Some people who've seen it
are calling the store.

01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:43.219
They're asking about this deer
and the Christmas lights.

01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:45.763
I'm not sure what to tell them.

01:18:46.681 --> 01:18:48.558
Uh, video? I don't know
anything about a video.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:51.561
Well, I just thought maybe
Mr. Mcshane had something to do with it.

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:54.480
I don't think so, but I can
check it out and find out.

01:18:55.023 --> 01:18:56.691
Isthatokay? Sally: Okay.

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:57.984
Okay. Bye.

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:00.862
(Phone rings)

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:06.075
Hello. Iffy: Claire. Iffy.

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.286
What's with this video, man?

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.788
This is fantastic news.

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:14.125
Iffy, I don't know
anything about a video.

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.294
Okay? Goodbye.
Iffy: What about...

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:17.420
(Call disconnects)

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:20.882
What's going on, Claire?
I have no idea.

01:19:24.052 --> 01:19:25.053
Gloria: Enjoy.

01:19:27.889 --> 01:19:30.058
(Christmas music plays
over video)

01:19:32.018 --> 01:19:35.063
Hey, guys, we've got a very
important announcement to make.

01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:37.774
Betty and bud's
hardware store is not closing.

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:39.692
I repeat, we are not closing.

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:40.777
Gloria: And you can help.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:43.363
Come to the store today
and meet the real prancer!

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.447
What the...

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.865
Yeah. Is that a deer?

01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:48.802
Haley: And we need loads and loads of
lights, so bring all the lights you've got

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.804
'cause we 're going to make
Betty and bud's hardware store...

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:53.539
The most happiest, brightest
place in the whole world!

01:19:53.623 --> 01:19:55.208
So come today
so we can see you there.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:58.711
And we're gonna have Carol
singing with Tyler on the piano!

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.460
Tyler: Oh, no, you didn't.

01:20:00.755 --> 01:20:01.875
And if you don't come today,

01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:04.425
you're gonna miss out
on some real Christmas magic.

01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:05.635
See you guys there!

01:20:11.516 --> 01:20:12.850
Both: Tyler!

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:17.981
Why shouldn't we have
made the video?

01:20:18.064 --> 01:20:20.876
Gerald: At the very least, you
should've talked to me before you did it.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.986
You'd have said no, dad.
Maybe I would.

01:20:23.111 --> 01:20:25.321
Maybe I'm afraid... Haley:
Did you even watch the video?

01:20:25.405 --> 01:20:28.008
Can you believe what that deer
did to the lights on the main street?

01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:29.033
Haley?

01:20:29.117 --> 01:20:31.220
Come on. That's done with
some sort of special effect.

01:20:31.244 --> 01:20:33.162
I knew you would say that.
Erica: Haley!

01:20:33.246 --> 01:20:35.957
No, you're either part of the
problem or part of the solution.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.184
Which is it going to be for you?

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:38.602
Gerald: Why are you
singling me out?

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:40.837
Gloria said you hired
a hunter to kill the deer.

01:20:42.422 --> 01:20:43.840
Bud: It's suffocating up there.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:46.676
Can't hardly breathe,
it's so damn hot.

01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:50.471
That right there, that's
why we made the video.

01:21:06.738 --> 01:21:09.282
Grandad, I made you something.

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:16.456
It's okay, you can
read it later.

01:21:17.123 --> 01:21:19.250
Hurry up! Come on. Tyler: Okay.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:20.501
It's not that heavy.

01:21:20.585 --> 01:21:21.586
Got them?

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:24.630
Got 'em.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.966
He goes in there.

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:29.886
Okay, let's see here.
(Engine starts)

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:31.387
Are you going to get us
all killed?

01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:33.890
No. Never drove
in the winter before, though.

01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:37.018
(Exclaims)

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:39.437
Haley. It's okay.
(Chuckles nervously)

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.521
It's okay.

01:21:41.064 --> 01:21:43.066
Okay, let's do this again.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.828
What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:21:55.912 --> 01:21:58.081
The kids have just
taken off in Claire's car.

01:21:58.164 --> 01:21:59.624
Hold on, ger.

01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:00.958
I'll go after them. But why?

01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:03.044
Because you're way too upset.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:04.837
Know what you can do?

01:22:05.797 --> 01:22:08.466
Go stop Finn Wally
from going after prancer!

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:11.260
Prancer? You're calling
him prancer now?

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:16.891
You don't actually think that deer
caused those lights to turn on, do you?

01:22:17.725 --> 01:22:19.352
Want to know what
I think, honey?

01:22:20.186 --> 01:22:23.397
A little magic can
take you a long way.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:26.984
(Chuckles)

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.489
(Door closes)

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:35.326
What's that?

01:22:35.743 --> 01:22:37.787
Uh, this is a book Gloria made.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:39.455
I found it on dad's desk.

01:22:39.539 --> 01:22:42.208
It's all about what those two
have been up to this week.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:44.710
Let me see that.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:49.650
Haley, look out, that's a car!

01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:50.800
Haley: (Screams) Oh, my god!

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:52.051
(Brakes squeal)

01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:53.594
(Horn blaring)

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.763
Oh, my god!

01:22:55.847 --> 01:22:58.391
What was that?
I have no clue, Tyler!

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.268
That was the wrong
side of the road!

01:23:00.351 --> 01:23:02.270
What? It's not my fault!

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.140
Claire: This is your mother.

01:23:04.272 --> 01:23:07.066
You call me back right now.
Do you hear me?

01:23:08.109 --> 01:23:10.319
Man. Nobody is answering me.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:11.946
Gloria, Erica.

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:13.781
Erica's probably still driving.

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:14.949
(Sighs)

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:16.909
What's wrong?

01:23:17.952 --> 01:23:19.453
I'm the bad guy in this story.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:22.707
Yeah. Damn.

01:23:26.711 --> 01:23:29.755
Wally: Good night forever,
Mr. Reindeer.

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:33.009
Finn Wally always gets his man.

01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:36.721
(Prancer bellows in distance)

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:43.477
Oh, my gosh, it has 100 views.
There's going to be so many people.

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:45.897
You're a terrible filmmaker.
Great. Nobody's here.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.981
Iffy: Gloria.

01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:49.775
Great news about the video
and that deer.

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:51.110
Iffy.

01:23:52.445 --> 01:23:54.322
Who are you? Iffy nailer.

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:56.616
Oh, I'm Haley, iffy nailer.

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:58.427
Are you going to help us
put the Christmas lights out?

01:23:58.451 --> 01:24:00.828
Yeah. Well, if enough
people turn up, that is.

01:24:00.912 --> 01:24:03.372
Iffy: Well, people in
brightridge, hopefully, yeah.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:07.877
Tevin: I think I saw some
Christmas lights around... yeah.

01:24:08.419 --> 01:24:09.420
Here.

01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:11.923
(Laughs) Nice one, tevin.

01:24:12.006 --> 01:24:13.549
Well, let's get started.

01:24:13.633 --> 01:24:15.760
That's for the back.
Woman: Get inside, it's cold.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:19.847
Where is the deer?

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:21.182
Woman: Okay, come on, let's go.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:23.559
Boy: The video said there
was going to be a reindeer.

01:24:23.643 --> 01:24:24.723
Gloria: We found some more.

01:24:25.645 --> 01:24:27.230
Stu: There's plenty of lights.

01:24:27.313 --> 01:24:28.689
It's nice. Look.

01:24:28.773 --> 01:24:32.151
No, stu, come on.
We haven't even started.

01:24:32.235 --> 01:24:34.546
We need the whole place to
be covered with Christmas lights.

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:35.863
Here come more troops.

01:24:35.947 --> 01:24:37.227
Haley: Hey, they brought lights.

01:24:40.868 --> 01:24:43.996
They're okay, Claire. I'll call
you back when we've had words.

01:24:45.498 --> 01:24:46.707
(Erica clears throat)

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:48.111
Man 1: Hello.
Man 2: Good morning.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:50.211
Woman 1: Hi, iffy. Guys,
how's it going?

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:51.545
Woman 2: Merry Christmas.

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:55.508
Thank you.

01:24:58.177 --> 01:24:59.845
(Both chuckle)

01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:03.849
Gloria: Tevin, we can't have
tangled lights. Come on, back to work.

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:15.528
Listen, dad.

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:22.076
All I want is for you to feel the way
you did when mom was still with us.

01:25:26.372 --> 01:25:27.665
You were happy back then.

01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:38.301
I've always been good with
numbers, you know, practical things.

01:25:40.011 --> 01:25:41.637
Flights of fancy, though,

01:25:43.514 --> 01:25:45.308
it's kind of
the deep end for me.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:50.479
But look,

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:55.318
I finished checking the store's
books like you wanted me to.

01:25:58.779 --> 01:26:00.323
There's a decent amount
of debt there.

01:26:01.532 --> 01:26:03.617
And it'll be a challenge
to sort it all out.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:08.497
I want to help you.

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:10.249
With the store.

01:26:12.752 --> 01:26:15.254
I got a few ideas that might
help turn things around,

01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:17.506
and I just wanted you
to know that.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:25.890
And as far as the retirement home
goes, well, Claire and I have been talking,

01:26:25.973 --> 01:26:28.225
and we're gonna work something
out so you can stay here,

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:30.978
and you'll be safe.

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:36.484
'Cause that's the most
important thing.

01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:40.154
That you're safe.

01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:45.910
I love you, dad.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:55.711
Okay, uh, I better go.

01:26:57.588 --> 01:27:00.466
There's a hunter out there
I need to, you know...

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:05.596
Before he does any damage
I'll regret for the rest of my life.

01:27:10.184 --> 01:27:11.936
You should watch
the video on there.

01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:13.687
The kids made it for you.

01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:22.947
(Sighs)

01:27:26.242 --> 01:27:27.785
(Engine sputtering)

01:27:32.957 --> 01:27:35.126
Sure about this, ger?

01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:37.329
I mean, do you even remember
how to ride one of these?

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.088
Well, we're about to find out.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.008
(Engine sputters)

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.431
Hmm.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:51.517
(Engine running)

01:27:57.898 --> 01:27:59.024
Wish me luck.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:04.989
Whoa! It's fast.
(Continues exclaiming)

01:28:05.573 --> 01:28:07.616
(Yells) I got this! Good luck.

01:28:08.576 --> 01:28:09.577
(Giggles)

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.036
(Piano tuning)

01:28:12.872 --> 01:28:14.665
(Indistinct chatter)

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:22.339
When are you ever going
to play that thing?

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:25.342
Where's mom and Haley?

01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:28.179
Oh. They're out helping out
with the lights.

01:28:30.014 --> 01:28:31.932
You two are from that video.

01:28:32.016 --> 01:28:33.142
(Chuckles) (Gasps)

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:36.270
Where's the deer?
When's it gonna be here?

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:37.771
Oh, the deer.

01:28:37.897 --> 01:28:39.899
Oh, prancer's coming,
don't worry.

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:42.193
It's coming.
The reindeer's coming.

01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:45.070
You don't really think the
deer's going to come, do you?

01:28:45.154 --> 01:28:46.447
Oh, I do hope he does.

01:28:47.448 --> 01:28:48.949
(Piano tuning)

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:52.912
(Huffs)

01:28:57.583 --> 01:28:59.001
(Gun cocks)

01:29:02.463 --> 01:29:03.964
(Grunting softly)

01:29:08.469 --> 01:29:09.678
What the...

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.890
(Snowmobile approaching)

01:29:15.476 --> 01:29:19.104
Not this time. This time
you are going down.

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:22.650
Finn! Stop!

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:27.530
Wally: Get out
of the way, mcshane!

01:29:27.613 --> 01:29:28.781
Put the rifle away!

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:30.199
Wally: The deer is mine!

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:31.825
Finn, your contract's canceled.

01:29:31.909 --> 01:29:32.910
Do you hear me?

01:29:32.993 --> 01:29:34.537
Wally: Nobody's gonna stop me!

01:29:38.415 --> 01:29:40.251
Oh! Typical!

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:42.836
Thought we fixed this.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.463
(Engine sputters) (Grunts)

01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:53.305
Deck the halls
with boughs of Holly

01:29:53.389 --> 01:29:56.016
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.812
'tis the season to be jolly

01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:02.356
fa, la, la, la, la, la, la

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.321
Um, iffy, what's going on?

01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:11.240
I called these guys
in case we have a problem.

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:13.576
What sort of problem?

01:30:13.659 --> 01:30:16.579
So many lights are being put
up, we could overload the circuit.

01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:18.289
We might have to take
some of them down.

01:30:18.998 --> 01:30:21.458
No, we're not taking any
down, and we need them all.

01:30:21.542 --> 01:30:23.502
I know you want
all the lights, Gloria,

01:30:23.586 --> 01:30:26.130
but the infrastructure's
shot here in brightridge.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:27.881
What does that even mean?

01:30:28.424 --> 01:30:31.176
We turn on all the lights on
main street at the same time,

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:33.053
the whole town could go dark.

01:32:05.062 --> 01:32:06.063
What are you doing?

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:11.068
O Christmas tree
o Christmas tree

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:14.488
thy leaves are so unchanging

01:32:14.571 --> 01:32:18.492
o Christmas tree
o Christmas tree

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:21.412
merry Christmas. Bye.

01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:25.749
Brightridge people, they're
the best in the whole wide world.

01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:27.710
That's my 10th spring pre-order.

01:32:27.835 --> 01:32:29.670
Whoa! I know.

01:32:30.254 --> 01:32:31.797
Gold, yes? Woman: Yes, please.

01:32:37.553 --> 01:32:39.221
(Playing jingle bells)

01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:43.684
(Singing)
Oh, what fun it is to ride

01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:46.103
in a one horse open sleigh, hey!

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:50.482
Jingle bells, jingle bells
jingle all the way

01:32:50.566 --> 01:32:53.944
oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh

01:32:54.945 --> 01:32:57.072
hear that, Gloria? Music.

01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.241
What's wrong?

01:32:59.783 --> 01:33:01.326
Well, what do you think, Haley?

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:03.036
None of the lights are working.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.621
Prancer's nowhere to be seen

01:33:04.705 --> 01:33:06.999
and nothing is going
according to my plans.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.501
But the store is jammed.
So what?

01:33:09.585 --> 01:33:11.712
If only... if what?

01:33:12.171 --> 01:33:15.048
If grandad was here.
We did all of this for him.

01:33:15.132 --> 01:33:17.426
All these people
are here for him.

01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:19.428
I've got videos.
He'll see what went down.

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:21.889
Just doesn't feel the same.

01:33:22.347 --> 01:33:26.018
Man: This is the last fuse. Woman:
If this doesn't work, I'll blow my fuse.

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:28.101
I'm trying here, I'm trying.
Woman: Please, fix it!

01:33:28.145 --> 01:33:29.646
You fix it. Damn box!

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:32.191
(All gasp) Oh, my god.

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:34.318
(All cheering)

01:33:35.277 --> 01:33:36.945
(All groan) Oh, my gosh.

01:33:39.782 --> 01:33:42.034
Woman: What happened?
Child: What's going on?

01:33:43.285 --> 01:33:44.620
(Car door opens)

01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:53.837
(Gasps)

01:33:53.921 --> 01:33:56.965
Grandad, you came. I had to.

01:33:57.508 --> 01:33:59.510
I had to thank you
for that beautiful book.

01:34:00.427 --> 01:34:02.805
Your grandma would have
loved that book, too.

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:10.312
(People gasping)

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.880
Look, a reindeer.

01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:47.891
(Huffing)

01:34:55.232 --> 01:34:56.233
Bud: Hey, there.

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:58.610
Remind you of somebody you know?

01:34:59.111 --> 01:35:00.445
You finally came.

01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:05.200
No animal ever got
the better of firm Wally.

01:35:05.659 --> 01:35:07.703
No animal is about
to now, neither.

01:35:07.786 --> 01:35:08.912
(Grunts)

01:35:10.622 --> 01:35:13.041
Gerald: Finn, are you crazy?
Put the riffle away!

01:35:13.667 --> 01:35:15.127
(People exclaim)

01:35:16.545 --> 01:35:18.380
Wally: Just get off! Get off!

01:35:19.798 --> 01:35:22.759
I'm finishing the job, whether
you like it or not, mcshane.

01:35:22.843 --> 01:35:24.011
Bud: Hey. Santa?

01:35:25.387 --> 01:35:26.513
(People cheering)

01:35:26.597 --> 01:35:28.140
(Police siren wailing)

01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:32.495
Wally: You've done it now,
old man. You've done it now.

01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:34.622
Officer: You're under
arrest, Wally. I'm under arrest?

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:35.898
What about these two?

01:35:36.023 --> 01:35:38.483
You have the right to remain
silent. I know my rights!

01:35:38.567 --> 01:35:40.027
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:35:40.110 --> 01:35:41.653
Who I will call
as soon as I can...

01:35:41.737 --> 01:35:43.322
What you do not
have the right to do

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:44.740
is hunt in the middle of town...

01:35:44.823 --> 01:35:46.843
You don't have to read me my
rights every time I'm arrested.

01:35:46.867 --> 01:35:48.587
Officer: And endanger
citizens you idiot!

01:35:49.828 --> 01:35:51.914
(People cheering and clapping)

01:35:52.831 --> 01:35:54.917
That was awesome, dad.

01:35:55.042 --> 01:35:56.877
Aw, thanks, honey.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.838
That was nothing.
If your grandfather hadn't...

01:35:59.922 --> 01:36:02.382
No. You're the one that
stopped Wally from shooting.

01:36:02.466 --> 01:36:04.009
I only threw one punch.

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:06.094
I think it's time to celebrate.

01:36:06.178 --> 01:36:07.596
All: Yes!

01:36:09.765 --> 01:36:12.184
Erica: You need a hot
chocolate. You're right. I think I do.

01:36:55.394 --> 01:36:56.436
Come on.

01:37:01.108 --> 01:37:02.985
(Singing)
We wish you a merry Christmas

01:37:03.068 --> 01:37:05.278
we wish you a merry Christmas

01:37:05.362 --> 01:37:07.531
we wish you a merry Christmas

01:37:07.614 --> 01:37:09.700
and a happy new year

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:12.411
good tidings we bring

01:37:12.494 --> 01:37:14.121
well, look at you.

01:37:14.204 --> 01:37:15.998
Should I call you
Thomas or Santa?

01:37:16.081 --> 01:37:18.208
You can call me
whatever you like.

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:20.627
How about some hot
cider, Nancy? In a minute.

01:37:20.711 --> 01:37:22.421
I want to say hi to some people.

01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:25.132
Then I want you to tell
me all about this deer.

01:37:25.215 --> 01:37:26.216
It's a deal.

01:37:32.139 --> 01:37:33.348
What's that supposed to mean?

01:37:37.686 --> 01:37:39.396
We're just having
a conversation.

01:37:50.741 --> 01:37:52.826
Hey, come.

01:37:55.037 --> 01:37:57.080
There is something I
want to talk to you about.

01:37:57.164 --> 01:37:58.874
You know, I'm sorry, right,

01:37:58.957 --> 01:38:01.043
about everything
I've done this past week.

01:38:01.126 --> 01:38:03.587
Oh, honey. No, no, no. I know.

01:38:03.670 --> 01:38:05.672
Okay. I know why
you did all those things.

01:38:06.715 --> 01:38:10.177
And I know that it's kind of
been really tough for us lately.

01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:13.847
It was mostly because of dad.

01:38:15.432 --> 01:38:16.600
I read the text.

01:38:18.852 --> 01:38:19.853
You did?

01:38:24.316 --> 01:38:26.735
You know that Germany's
not too far away, right?

01:38:27.736 --> 01:38:29.780
And that he can still be
part of your life.

01:38:30.572 --> 01:38:33.241
Yeah, but he hasn't been
for a while now.

01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:36.787
Um, I don't think
he's coming back.

01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:40.457
Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.

01:38:41.374 --> 01:38:42.417
I'm so sorry.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.629
I should have talked to you
about this sooner.

01:38:48.256 --> 01:38:49.257
But you know what?

01:38:50.008 --> 01:38:51.176
I've been thinking.

01:38:51.802 --> 01:38:52.803
Hey.

01:38:55.263 --> 01:38:58.350
Your grandad, he's going to
need some extra help, right?

01:38:58.767 --> 01:39:01.311
We thought maybe we
could get him a nurse, but...

01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:07.567
And then I suggested that
maybe you and I stay here.

01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:09.861
I thought you'd neversaythat

01:39:09.945 --> 01:39:11.488
oh, we can stay
for a while, Gloria.

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:13.782
Or maybe for... ever, maybe?

01:39:14.491 --> 01:39:17.577
I love it here. I love the people,
I love the town, I love the woods.

01:39:18.912 --> 01:39:20.789
Brightridge already
feels like home.

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:22.707
Yeah. Yeah?

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:25.710
Well, do you wanna
go tell grandad?

01:39:40.392 --> 01:39:43.311
Everybody seemed
to clear out pretty fast.

01:39:43.395 --> 01:39:45.689
Yeah, well, your
star attraction left.

01:39:45.814 --> 01:39:48.817
Oh, grandad, I've got something
really important to tell you.

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:49.901
Shoot

01:39:49.985 --> 01:39:55.907
okay, so me and mom want
to stay here with you, maybe?

01:39:56.408 --> 01:39:57.576
What do you mean, stay?

01:39:58.577 --> 01:40:01.246
You know what I mean.
Live here with you.

01:40:01.997 --> 01:40:05.125
Uh, well, I don't... lmean...

01:40:05.834 --> 01:40:07.895
No, no, no. I get what you
mean. You don't want us here.

01:40:07.919 --> 01:40:10.088
No, no, no. Of course I do.

01:40:10.172 --> 01:40:12.674
Itwould be, uh...
It would be fantastic.

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:16.970
But, um, don't you think it would
get kind of boring living here?

01:40:17.429 --> 01:40:20.932
Grandad, more exciting things have
happened in brightridge in less than a week

01:40:21.016 --> 01:40:24.436
than in ten years in London. Oh.

01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:27.772
And either way, I love you.

01:40:28.398 --> 01:40:30.192
I don't want to be
anywhere else.

01:40:33.403 --> 01:40:34.404
I love you, too.

01:40:35.405 --> 01:40:36.531
(Chuckles softly)

01:40:36.615 --> 01:40:40.285
Um, all right. But if you're
going to be living with me,

01:40:40.368 --> 01:40:42.221
we have to set up some ground
rules. You understand?

01:40:42.245 --> 01:40:44.789
Okay. Good idea.
Can't be such slob.

01:40:44.873 --> 01:40:46.593
You can't be buzzing
around me all the time.

01:40:46.666 --> 01:40:47.709
I need my space.

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:49.586
Okay, then you can't be
such a grump.

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:51.171
Ah, yeah, you have to, um...

01:40:51.546 --> 01:40:52.756
You have to, um...

01:40:53.757 --> 01:40:54.758
Whoa.

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.301
Bud: Oh.

01:40:56.384 --> 01:40:57.552
(Gloria gasps)

01:40:58.762 --> 01:41:00.222
Bud: Bloody brilliant.

01:41:00.305 --> 01:41:01.806
Gloria: Uh... (Bud chuckles)

01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:03.683
Bud: I think it's
rubbing off on me.

01:41:03.767 --> 01:41:05.393
(Gloria giggles)

01:41:05.477 --> 01:41:07.187
I'm gonna go tell
everybody, okay?

01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:11.441
Gloria: Once upon a time, there
was a couple named bud and Betty.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.278
They owned a hardware store
in the heart of town.

01:41:16.279 --> 01:41:19.783
But one Christmas,
Betty wasn't there anymore,

01:41:19.866 --> 01:41:21.910
and bud forgot
how to feel christmassy.

01:41:22.869 --> 01:41:27.040
That was until prancer,
the magical reindeer, appeared

01:41:27.123 --> 01:41:28.917
and bud saw him fly.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.835
Like, actually fly.

01:41:32.379 --> 01:41:33.880
Prancer showed bud

01:41:33.964 --> 01:41:37.050
that he needed to let some
light back into his life again

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:42.430
and reminded him Betty's always with
him when his family and friends are too.

01:43:07.807 --> 01:43:09.726
(Christmas music playing)

01:43:17.192 --> 01:43:20.779
Got a feeling that
Christmas day is near

01:43:21.988 --> 01:43:25.575
and the spirit of
Santa claus is here

01:43:26.993 --> 01:43:29.329
such a wonderful time

01:43:29.412 --> 01:43:31.790
when the snow is in town

01:43:31.873 --> 01:43:36.503
it's a hell of a thrill
when the sleigh bells sound

01:43:36.586 --> 01:43:41.716
it's the time of the year
for fleeting glances

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:45.804
when the guy in the stall
says "merry Christmas"

01:43:46.471 --> 01:43:51.476
what a glorious night
singing o Tannenbaum

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:56.231
to be cozy and warm
when the snow is falling down

01:43:56.314 --> 01:43:58.650
it's a wonderful time

01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:00.819
betcha more than a dime

01:44:00.902 --> 01:44:03.113
the city bell's gonna chime

01:44:03.696 --> 01:44:05.990
the Christmas star's gonna shine

01:44:06.074 --> 01:44:08.451
and old folks singing in rhyme

01:44:08.535 --> 01:44:10.829
merry Christmas

01:44:30.515 --> 01:44:35.270
It's the time of the year
for fleeting glances

01:44:35.353 --> 01:44:40.191
when the guy in the stall
says "merry Christmas"

01:44:40.275 --> 01:44:45.321
what a glorious night
singing o Tannenbaum

01:44:45.405 --> 01:44:50.326
when you're cozy and warm
and the snow is falling down

01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:52.454
what a wonderful time

01:44:52.537 --> 01:44:54.831
betcha more than a dime

01:44:54.914 --> 01:44:57.292
the city bell's gonna chime

01:44:57.375 --> 01:44:59.878
Christmas star's gonna shine

01:44:59.961 --> 01:45:02.297
and old folks singing in rhyme

01:45:03.089 --> 01:45:07.218
merry Christmas
