Why frittatas for dinner, you ask?

- Because,

00:25.618 --> 00:27.412
The secret to a good frittata

00:27.413 --> 00:30.084

to fall in love with you.

00:48.789 --> 00:51.544

00:51.545 --> 00:54.257
that you wanna go back to
your apartment in Los Angeles,

00:54.258 --> 00:58.223
giving them the completely
reasonable impression

00:58.224 --> 01:00.646
that you and the eggs
are in a relationship,

01:00.647 --> 01:02.733
maybe even meet your egg's parents.

01:02.734 --> 01:04.861
That's very reasonable.

01:04.863 --> 01:07.660
Now, once you've lulled your eggs

01:07.661 --> 01:09.956
into a false sense of security,

01:09.957 --> 01:12.293
reveal your ruse,

01:12.294 --> 01:16.678
and crack them open before your eyes.

01:16.679 --> 01:20.769
And drop them into
those cold blades of steel.

20:58.456 --> 20:59.542
