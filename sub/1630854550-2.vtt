WEBVTT

00:14.880 --> 00:17.680
Do you remember The Admiral's Glass?

00:17.720 --> 00:19.440
The Admiral's what?

00:19.480 --> 00:21.480
Glass.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.920
By Southwark Bridge.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.960
I think that's well and truly
out now, Kim.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.960
'I don't think I know any pubs
in Southwark.'

00:38.000 --> 00:39.800
'You remember this one.'

00:42.520 --> 00:45.920
SIREN

00:45.960 --> 00:47.920
What's that?

00:55.840 --> 00:58.200
MURMURING

00:59.480 --> 01:00.000
I want fucking witnesses.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.560
I want fucking witnesses.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.280
To what?
Open the fucking door.

01:04.320 --> 01:06.200
Kim, don't be ridiculous.
Open the door!

01:06.240 --> 01:08.240
Open it yourself. It isn't locked.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.320
You can't seriously believe
they've come here for you?

01:20.360 --> 01:22.720
I don't know what
to fucking well believe right now.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.960
MEN CHATTER

01:36.960 --> 01:38.800
'Be honest, Nick...

01:40.280 --> 01:43.520
'..did you or did you not
come to Beirut as my friend?'

01:43.560 --> 01:45.280
'Well, I'll tell you this much -

01:45.320 --> 01:48.560
'MI5 were champing at the bit
to send their first 11 out here,'

01:48.600 --> 01:51.280
until C intervened with the Minister

01:51.320 --> 01:54.320
and insisted that this was still
technically an intelligence matter

01:54.360 --> 01:58.040
as opposed to a security one,
because you are, after all,

01:58.080 --> 02:00.000
an SIS man for whom there
may still be a path to redemption.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
an SIS man for whom there
may still be a path to redemption.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.560
CRYING

02:06.600 --> 02:08.920
Poor dear.
Yeah.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.760
I mean you.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.000
Have you finished buggering about
yet?

02:22.840 --> 02:25.720
One more thing,
what you're accusing me of...

02:25.760 --> 02:27.280
That's new.
What?

02:27.320 --> 02:29.080
'You're wearing a wedding ring now?'

02:29.120 --> 02:30.000
'It's what you get
when you marry an American.'

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
'It's what you get
when you marry an American.'

02:31.040 --> 02:32.080
SHE LAUGHS

02:33.120 --> 02:34.720
Treason.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.200
That's what I'm accusing you of.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.920
To be clear.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.440
Speaking of America,
what have they been told?

02:56.600 --> 02:57.640
Nothing.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.000
'Yet. Which is why
the sooner you tell me everything,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.360
'Yet. Which is why
the sooner you tell me everything,

03:01.400 --> 03:03.240
'the sooner
we can take care of them...'

03:04.280 --> 03:06.240
..and any others
that might be out there.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.400
Others?
Well, you must've thought about

03:10.440 --> 03:12.440
what the Russians
might try to do to you

03:12.480 --> 03:14.480
if they ever find out you're blown.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.880
So...
CLEARS THROAT

03:15.920 --> 03:18.240
..in that regard, yes,

03:18.280 --> 03:22.000
I suppose you could say that
I came to Beirut as your friend.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.000
'The Admiral's what?'
'Glass.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.920
'The Admiral's what?'
'Glass.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.920
'By Southwark Bridge.'

03:35.960 --> 03:37.960
Any more tea in the...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.160
'I think that's
well and truly out now, Kim.'

03:42.400 --> 03:45.840
'I don't think I know any pubs
in Southwark.'

03:45.880 --> 03:49.840
Bloody hell, look at you.
Freezing to death!

03:52.240 --> 03:54.240
Boots!

03:56.520 --> 03:57.520
Ooh!

04:00.240 --> 04:01.920
Pay the toll.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.920
More, please.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.520
SHE LAUGHS

04:11.680 --> 04:15.000
I like your carrots. What?

04:15.040 --> 04:17.560
I know that face.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.480
I mean it!

04:19.520 --> 04:21.960
They are very impressive carrots,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.240
not what you'd expect to see
in a London back garden.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.040
Nearly finished.
Take your time.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.000
I'll just be a minute.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.960
I'll just be a minute.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.680
'Speaking of America,
what have they been told?'

04:35.720 --> 04:39.160
'Nothing. Yet. Which is why
the sooner you tell me everything,

04:39.200 --> 04:41.520
'the sooner
we can take care of them,

04:41.560 --> 04:43.920
'and any others
that might be out there.'

04:57.760 --> 04:59.600
Ciao, ragazzi!

04:59.640 --> 05:00.000
CHEERING

05:00.000 --> 05:02.440
CHEERING

05:02.480 --> 05:06.280
Those poor bloody foxes.
It's a mink, che cazzo!

05:06.320 --> 05:07.880
Hundred percent mink.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.560
IN COCKNEY ACCENT: Cheeky bastard!

05:09.600 --> 05:12.280
Cuppa tea and a bacon and egg roll
for young Nicholas, please, love.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.440
Ooh, I like-a
the look of your salami.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.920
Whole or sliced, sir?
All together now:

05:16.960 --> 05:21.440
What do I look-a like,
a fucking money box?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.080
LAUGHING

05:23.120 --> 05:24.720
Morning, gents.
Morning. Morning.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.760
PHONE RINGS

05:26.960 --> 05:28.800
Thirty four and a half hours
of two spies

05:28.840 --> 05:30.000
talking rings around each other.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.680
talking rings around each other.

05:30.720 --> 05:35.240
Elliott, though, was in Beirut
for four days - 96 hours,

05:35.280 --> 05:36.720
so that's 60...

05:36.760 --> 05:37.880
..one and a half.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.520
Let's call it 62 hours
we know sweet FA about.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.240
Explain to me cricket.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.680
Nobody wins. What is point?

05:53.400 --> 05:55.720
England against Australia.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.000
Oh, it's a draw!

06:00.000 --> 06:00.280
Oh, it's a draw!

06:00.320 --> 06:03.680
That's good?
It could have been worse.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.080
We leave in 30 minutes.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.760
So, for example, on the last night
he was there, believe it or not,

06:21.800 --> 06:26.760
he went for dinner at Philby's
flat on Rue what-ya-ma-call-it...

06:26.800 --> 06:29.600
Kantari.
Er, and...

06:29.640 --> 06:30.000
SIS expect us...
KNOCK

06:30.000 --> 06:31.840
SIS expect us...
KNOCK

06:31.880 --> 06:34.680
..to believe that they talked about,
what, the weather?

06:34.720 --> 06:37.000
More likely cricket.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.840
Cricket. Right.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.360
Make your point, Mrs Thomas.

06:42.400 --> 06:49.040
Philby's life was on the line,
as was the meaning of Elliott's,

06:49.080 --> 06:51.760
not to mention the reputation
of the Intelligence Service,

06:51.800 --> 06:55.600
so I, for one,
find it very hard to believe

06:55.640 --> 06:58.200
that he'd come back from Beirut
empty-handed.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.000
Based on what?

07:00.000 --> 07:00.760
Based on what?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
His entire career.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.120
He was supposed
to come back with Philby.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.120
Maybe... he came back
with something better.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.000
From Philby?
Such as?

07:19.040 --> 07:21.000
I dunno yet.
Ah.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
But I do know
we won't find an answer to that

07:23.080 --> 07:24.800
in an interrogation room.

07:24.840 --> 07:28.080
Very sure of yourself,
aren't you, Mrs Thomas?

07:28.120 --> 07:29.680
Is that a problem?

07:33.800 --> 07:37.600
I believe that under
that posh, jovial exterior

07:37.640 --> 07:43.680
is a man fighting for his life,
which is his career.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.200
So I suggest that we take him
off the lead,

07:48.240 --> 07:51.760
watch where he goes, what he does,
who he talks to...

07:51.800 --> 07:53.680
All right, hold on a minute.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.000
Say, for the sake of argument,
we do that...

07:57.160 --> 07:59.160
..what makes you think
you're the right person?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.000
She doesn't.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.120
She doesn't.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.680
That's not what she's saying.
Is it?

08:05.840 --> 08:08.120
So I'll say it for her -

08:08.160 --> 08:10.800
SIS will never see her coming...

08:13.280 --> 08:17.320
..and even if they do,
they're bound to underestimate her.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.720
MEN TALKING
Just a minute.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.760
MAN SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE
I said just a fucking minute!

09:20.600 --> 09:23.360
Did you hear about Olga,
the Russian shot putter?

09:24.800 --> 09:27.520
"Doctor, Doctor," says Olga,

09:27.560 --> 09:30.000
"lately, I have been growing
a lot of hair on my chest."

09:30.000 --> 09:30.880
"lately, I have been growing
a lot of hair on my chest."

09:30.920 --> 09:33.960
The doctor says,
"Oh, really, Olga? How odd.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.040
"Mind me asking
how far down it grows?"

09:36.080 --> 09:39.560
To which Olga replies,
"All the way down to my balls."

09:39.600 --> 09:41.760
LAUGHING

09:44.160 --> 09:46.160
Isn't the doctor Russian, too?

09:52.720 --> 09:55.200
LAUGHING

10:23.920 --> 10:25.520
GIRL, IN RUSSIAN:

10:25.560 --> 10:27.120
IN RUSSIAN:

10:34.720 --> 10:36.760
'I want fucking witnesses.'

10:36.800 --> 10:39.000
'To what?'
'Open the fucking door.'

10:39.000 --> 10:39.440
'To what?'
'Open the fucking door.'

10:39.480 --> 10:41.480
'Kim, don't be ridiculous!'
'Open the door!'

10:41.520 --> 10:43.080
'Open it yourself. It isn't locked.'

10:49.400 --> 10:51.800
Was he using the ambulance
as a distraction?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.360
I think in that instant
he was genuinely concerned

10:55.400 --> 10:57.760
that the men in white coats
were coming for him.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.360
That said, as we now know,

11:00.400 --> 11:03.480
one can never be completely certain
with a man like him.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.920
A man like him?

11:07.240 --> 11:08.880
Do you always have to have
the last word?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.160
No.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.640
DOOR OPENS

11:39.080 --> 11:40.480
Not what you expected?

11:41.880 --> 11:43.560
I don't know what I expected.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.360
'The Admiral's what?'

11:50.400 --> 11:52.800
'Glass. By Southwark Bridge.'

11:54.040 --> 11:55.920
'I don't think I know any pubs
in So...'

11:55.960 --> 11:58.080
What's so important
about The Admiral's Glass?

12:00.600 --> 12:02.520
Nothing. It's just a pub.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.920
Feels like a bit more
than just any old pub.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.000
It has to do with
a minor personal matter, that's all.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.160
It has to do with
a minor personal matter, that's all.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.240
Which is why I decided,

12:14.280 --> 12:17.760
in light of what I actually
went to Beirut to achieve

12:17.800 --> 12:21.560
and the small amount of time
I had to do it in, to let it go.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.000
Personal in what way?

12:23.040 --> 12:26.920
In that it's not really relevant
to any of this.

12:31.960 --> 12:36.960
I've listened to and analysed
every single second of every hour

12:37.000 --> 12:38.680
of you and Philby in Beirut.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.000
Please don't tell me
this is not relevant.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Please don't tell me
this is not relevant.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.280
Women.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.600
Pardon?

12:48.640 --> 12:50.000
Aileen.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.520
Aileen?

12:54.120 --> 12:56.160
Aileen Philby?

12:57.200 --> 12:59.640
Flora Solomon's best friend.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.040
The same Flora Solomon
who it took 25 years

13:02.080 --> 13:04.040
to come forward about Philby.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.880
Do you mind if I smoke?

13:08.920 --> 13:09.000
Burst into flames for all I care.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.560
Burst into flames for all I care.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.560
That was unnecessary. I'm sorry.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.040
Where on Earth did they find you?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.240
KNOCKING,
BARKING

13:29.920 --> 13:32.000
Will you be quiet,
you horrid little dog?!

13:32.040 --> 13:33.640
Sorry, come in.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.000
She called me
out of the blue one day,

13:39.000 --> 13:40.080
She called me
out of the blue one day,

13:40.120 --> 13:43.680
asking me to drop by, spring 1941,

13:43.720 --> 13:45.880
said she had something
"urgent and sensitive,"

13:45.920 --> 13:47.160
I think are the words she used,

13:47.200 --> 13:49.600
that she needed to discuss
in person.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.240
BARKING
Willie! Stop it this instant!

13:54.600 --> 13:56.360
We're in the drawing room.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.360
Hello, Nick.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.320
Aileen!
Darling, what a nice surprise.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.000
I didn't know you were
going to be here, too.

14:09.000 --> 14:09.280
I didn't know you were
going to be here, too.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.360
That's enough, Willie.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.720
Naughty Willie.
AILEEN CHUCKLES

14:13.760 --> 14:16.200
What?
Nothing.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.160
Anyone care for a drink?

14:18.200 --> 14:23.000
Actually, erm, if you don't mind,
Flora, I'm a little pushed for...

14:23.040 --> 14:24.200
Kim's cheating on me, Nick.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.640
SNORTS
What?!

14:26.680 --> 14:28.640
He's having an affair.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.120
Please, Nick, you can save us all
a great deal of time

14:32.160 --> 14:34.600
by sparing us the loyal friend act.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.320
This is the reason
you wanted to see me?

14:36.360 --> 14:39.000
Yes or no -
did you know he's having an affair?

14:39.000 --> 14:39.040
Yes or no -
did you know he's having an affair?

14:39.080 --> 14:42.720
No, of course I didn't know,
cos there's nothing to know!

14:42.760 --> 14:44.320
There's something wrong, Nick.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.400
Kim's behaviour...

14:48.520 --> 14:49.920
It...

14:49.960 --> 14:52.080
It's hard to describe, but...

14:52.120 --> 14:54.880
Here. Have one anyway.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.440
..a wife can tell.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.720
And, er...

15:02.080 --> 15:03.440
What?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.280
Nothing.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.600
No, no, what is it?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.880
I don't know.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.960
We need you to find out who she is.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.600
What? Oh, no.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.040
No, no. Absolutely not.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.160
Surely if he's innocent
there's nothing to worry about?

15:28.200 --> 15:31.520
Please, Nick.
There's no-one else I trust to ask.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.640
And if there is any hope of Kim
and I ever getting past this,

15:35.680 --> 15:38.520
then I first have to know the truth.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.000
Your words or hers?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.040
Your words or hers?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.080
Look, the point is,

15:43.120 --> 15:46.040
you'd be doing this for Kim
as much as anything else.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.080
With all due respect, Flora...

15:48.120 --> 15:51.080
Well, we all know what that means,
but go on.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.880
HE SIGHS

15:57.120 --> 15:59.160
What you're asking me to do
amounts to spying.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.720
On my closest friend.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.040
You actually said that?

16:29.240 --> 16:31.800
Single to Paddington.
Tuppence ha'penny, sir.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.880
Thank you.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.880
Mind the doors!

16:56.400 --> 16:57.960
Wait, please.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.800
He knew you were following him?

17:18.840 --> 17:22.240
No, I don't believe... Well, at
least I didn't think so at the time.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.400
It was the middle of the war.

17:24.440 --> 17:28.120
Tradecraft was something we were all
required to do at all times

17:28.160 --> 17:29.680
until it was second nature.

18:39.040 --> 18:43.400
'Why do all this if you
considered it such a betrayal?'

18:43.440 --> 18:47.520
I thought Aileen's suspicions
of an affair were more likely to be

18:47.560 --> 18:51.600
a misunderstanding caused by
the type of work he did for SIS,

18:51.640 --> 18:53.560
which, of course,
he could never tell her about.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.360
Secrets can be very testing
of a marriage.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.680
So I wanted to prove Aileen
and Flora wrong, and him innocent.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.880
You didn't think
he was the type to have an affair?

19:04.920 --> 19:06.640
I never said that.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.000
Surely you could've just told Flora
and Aileen anything

19:09.000 --> 19:09.120
Surely you could've just told Flora
and Aileen anything

19:09.160 --> 19:12.720
and they'd have
had to have taken your word for it?

19:12.760 --> 19:15.160
Now I suppose you're gonna tell me

19:15.200 --> 19:19.440
I had other subconscious reasons
to spy on him,

19:19.480 --> 19:22.720
beyond mere suspicions of adultery.

19:22.760 --> 19:26.200
Not even a niggling feeling
in the back of your mind?

19:27.520 --> 19:28.680
Sorry.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.800
SHE CLEARS THROAT

19:33.200 --> 19:35.600
Er, yeah, sorry, you were saying?

19:35.640 --> 19:37.840
I wasn't. You were.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.160
Do I believe that you,
a career intelligence officer

19:44.200 --> 19:46.240
and keen observer
of human behaviour,

19:46.280 --> 19:50.440
may have had a feeling that
all was not right with your friend?

19:52.520 --> 19:55.640
Mm-hm. That's precisely
what I'm saying.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.440
HORN TOOTS

20:02.880 --> 20:04.800
BARKING

20:17.320 --> 20:21.200
CHATTERING

21:10.120 --> 21:12.280
MAN LAUGHS

21:13.800 --> 21:15.240
Did he see you?

21:17.920 --> 21:21.960
If he did...
he didn't say a word about it.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.960
Everything was business as usual

21:25.000 --> 21:27.680
for the next couple of weeks
until...

21:40.240 --> 21:42.000
Nicholas Elliott and Ian Fleming.

21:43.040 --> 21:46.040
Achtung, Jerry.
Hello, Kim.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.160
Thank you, sir.
Ian.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.520
The moment of truth.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.040
Peter Tazelaar, Kim Philby.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.680
Peter's from Holland.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.320
And will soon be going back,
God willing.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.480
Dry as a bone.
What'd I tell you?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.600
Well, I'll be a Dutchman.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.480
Macallan's if I'm not mistaken.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.440
Peter's going to swim ashore

22:32.480 --> 22:34.920
and walk straight into
a German officers' shindig

22:34.960 --> 22:36.080
at a seaside hotel.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.000
We thought a little bit of whisky
on a jacket would be in order.

22:39.000 --> 22:39.840
We thought a little bit of whisky
on a jacket would be in order.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.400
Shouldn't it be Schnapps?

22:41.440 --> 22:43.520
Well, there's such a thing
as too clever, Kim.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.760
You come up with this wheeze?

22:47.800 --> 22:50.160
No, joint effort with Fleming here.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.760
A minute.

22:58.760 --> 23:02.280
What I'm about to tell you
must remain strictly between us.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.120
Oh, well, you know
there's no need to say...

23:05.160 --> 23:07.120
I've been a bloody fool, Nick.

23:08.760 --> 23:09.000
And I think now
Aileen might be on to me.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.360
And I think now
Aileen might be on to me.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.400
Oh? This is a personal thing.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.920
Has she said anything to you?

23:18.960 --> 23:21.840
Look, Kim, if it's all the same
I'd really rather not get dragged...

23:21.880 --> 23:24.120
Quite. Quite.
No need to say another word.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.280
You understand.
Perfectly.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.640
Good man.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.640
She has said something, hasn't she?
Excuse me, sir.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.000
SIGHS

23:39.000 --> 23:39.200
SIGHS

23:39.240 --> 23:42.920
Well, go on, then, spit it out, if
you must, before I change my mind.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.400
SIGHS

23:44.440 --> 23:48.840
Her name's Alice. Litzi.
She... She's Austrian.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.000
I met her in Vienna in '34

23:51.040 --> 23:54.240
when I was there, you know, trying
to cut my teeth as a journalist.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.280
She's the bravest woman
I've ever known.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.960
And also, as it happens, Jewish.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.440
So when the time came for her
to get out... You helped her.

24:03.480 --> 24:07.320
I-I shuffled some papers.
Papers? What kind of papers?

24:08.680 --> 24:09.000
Oh, Christ, no!
Marriage papers. Bloody hell, Kim.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.680
Oh, Christ, no!
Marriage papers. Bloody hell, Kim.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.720
It was only ever
meant to just be paper,

24:13.760 --> 24:16.200
and then all of a sudden
she's in London, and...

24:16.240 --> 24:19.680
SIGHS
What do I do, Nick? I...

24:19.720 --> 24:23.240
I... I never had
the slightest intention of...

24:23.280 --> 24:25.880
Cheating on Aileen, to be clear.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.600
Don't fucking tell me you've never
made any mistakes in your life!

24:28.640 --> 24:30.160
Aileen's about to have your baby.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.360
You know exactly what to do.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.600
He did see you at The Admiral's
Glass. He must've done.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.440
Probably not my finest hour.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.880
Why tell you about all that business
in Austria, though,

24:47.920 --> 24:52.120
when he could've just admitted
to having an affair

24:52.160 --> 24:53.600
and left it at that?

24:53.640 --> 24:58.320
He was obviously probing
to see what else I might know.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.320
Obviously? You mean in retrospect.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.600
Wasn't the resistance in Vienna...

25:10.560 --> 25:12.320
..communist?

25:12.360 --> 25:14.400
It was a workers' uprising.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.640
Right.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.040
Communism wasn't the problem then.
Fascism was.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.000
OK.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.280
You're probably thinking
why on Earth

25:26.320 --> 25:29.400
didn't I put two and two together,
right there and then. And?

25:29.440 --> 25:32.320
All I can tell you
is we were at war with Germany

25:32.360 --> 25:36.480
and Kim happened to be one of
the most effective espionage minds

25:36.520 --> 25:39.000
in that fight. That's a fact.

25:39.000 --> 25:39.120
in that fight. That's a fact.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.680
Despite everything
that came later,

25:42.720 --> 25:44.560
that will never, ever change.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.240
He's not having an affair.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.080
On that much,
I can give you my word.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.600
You see, his work - our work -

25:54.640 --> 25:56.880
the work we both do
to fight the Nazis...

25:59.040 --> 26:00.800
..can be quite, um...

26:02.840 --> 26:07.600
Well, it requires, erm, at times,
certain levels of, erm...

26:08.800 --> 26:09.000
Not to mention
the ungodly hours that we...

26:09.000 --> 26:11.960
Not to mention
the ungodly hours that we...

26:12.000 --> 26:14.840
Do stop waffling on, Nick!

26:14.880 --> 26:18.560
We know that you and Kim
work for MI6 or SIS

26:18.600 --> 26:21.040
or whatever it is
it's called these days.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.280
That's not
what Aileen's talking about.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.480
Is it, darling?
I...

26:27.600 --> 26:31.080
I... I don't know, I-I mean...

26:31.120 --> 26:33.240
I suppose.

26:33.280 --> 26:36.080
Well, I, for one,
think you're obfuscating.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.760
Well, now you mention it,
I did have plums for breakfast.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.080
Oh, for goodness' sake!
That Bertie Wooster turn you do

26:43.120 --> 26:47.680
is utterly beneath you and nobody
with half a brain falls for it.

26:47.720 --> 26:51.880
You're-You're a serious man
with a serious mind

26:51.920 --> 26:54.120
and this is very serious stuff.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.800
Damn it all,
she's six months pregnant!

26:56.840 --> 26:59.640
And Kim must be brought to heel
before it's too late.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.000
All right.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.120
I've tried to be patient and keep an
open mind, but now I've had enough.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.040
Now, listen, both of you.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.000
Kim is a good man
fighting hard for his country

27:09.000 --> 27:10.640
Kim is a good man
fighting hard for his country

27:10.680 --> 27:13.800
under some very difficult
circumstances. May I just say...

27:13.840 --> 27:16.960
He is categorically
not having an affair!

27:17.000 --> 27:21.040
Not only does he not have the time,
he would never do such a thing,

27:21.080 --> 27:23.280
and my advice to you, Aileen,

27:23.320 --> 27:25.680
is to stop worrying
about everything under the sun

27:25.720 --> 27:27.280
and start believing in him.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.760
And, Flora, with all due respect,

27:30.800 --> 27:33.160
keep your nose
out of other people's business.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.880
That is all I have to say
on the matter.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.200
Do you think Philby's safe
in the Soviet Union?

27:48.240 --> 27:50.120
Do you have confirmation
that's where he is?

27:50.160 --> 27:51.240
Let's assume.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.520
Safe from whom?

27:55.760 --> 27:57.520
Come on, now.

27:57.560 --> 28:01.200
Ah, do you mean
would we bump him off? One of us?

28:01.240 --> 28:02.760
What about the CIA?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.520
Ah, well,
them I'm afraid I can't vouch for.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.840
I have something to play you,
then I have a question.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.600
NICK: 'How long
has Flora bloody Solomon

28:23.640 --> 28:25.360
'known you're a Soviet
double agent?'

28:25.400 --> 28:28.640
From now on, no matter
how many clever ways

28:28.680 --> 28:31.680
you try to frame this nonsense, I'm
just not going to respond any more

28:31.720 --> 28:33.320
because it's not worth dignifying.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.480
You've known each other
since you were at Cambridge.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.000
I don't believe for a fucking minute

28:38.040 --> 28:41.000
she suddenly realised you were
a Soviet spy just last week!

28:41.000 --> 28:41.040
she suddenly realised you were
a Soviet spy just last week!

28:41.080 --> 28:42.480
SMASHING

28:42.520 --> 28:45.720
How many times do I have
to tell you, I am not a traitor!

28:45.760 --> 28:48.280
She's fucking well lying!
To MI5?

28:49.400 --> 28:51.800
She's still upset about Aileen.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.360
Rest in peace.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.560
Now you're accusing me
of killing Aileen?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.680
An alcoholic, bless her,

29:00.720 --> 29:03.480
with too many psychological problems
to count,

29:03.520 --> 29:06.000
who bloody well drank herself...

29:07.080 --> 29:10.680
Years after she left me!
You know, the irony is

29:10.720 --> 29:11.000
that even though you've managed
to hide your real self

29:11.000 --> 29:12.920
that even though you've managed
to hide your real self

29:12.960 --> 29:16.560
for all these years, I know you
all the better for it now.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.880
And today...

29:17.920 --> 29:20.080
you're a man on the brink.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.680
I can see it in your eyes,
plain as can be.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.600
By the way, I know you feel
responsible for Aileen's death.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.480
How could you not, after
everything you put her through?

29:34.120 --> 29:38.400
Because I also know you're not
a complete and utter monster.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.520
Do you resent Mrs Solomon?
Resent her?

29:49.560 --> 29:51.520
Well, you've read her statement
to MI5,

29:51.560 --> 29:54.160
she knew about Philby
going on 30 years.

29:54.200 --> 29:57.320
That he was a communist, maybe.
Not a spy.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.640
Right. OK.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.720
And the reason she would've kept
quiet about his communist beliefs

30:03.760 --> 30:06.200
would've been to protect
her friend, Aileen.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.440
How many people
do you think the Soviets killed

30:09.480 --> 30:11.000
based on the information
they got from Philby?

30:11.000 --> 30:11.680
based on the information
they got from Philby?

30:11.720 --> 30:13.360
I don't know.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.520
You don't know
or you don't wanna know?

30:16.560 --> 30:17.880
Now, now, Mrs Thomas.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.920
Hundreds, possibly thousands.

30:19.960 --> 30:23.120
You said so yourself, to Philby
in Beirut. It's on the tape.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.080
If Mrs Solomon knew Philby
was spying for the Soviets

30:26.120 --> 30:27.160
right from the beginning,

30:27.200 --> 30:29.600
more or less right after
he got back from Vienna...

30:30.640 --> 30:34.200
Hm...
how can you not resent her?

30:44.440 --> 30:46.240
Where are you going?

30:48.360 --> 30:49.480
Lunch.

30:52.240 --> 30:56.080
When did you introduce Philby
to Aileen?

30:56.120 --> 30:58.400
I didn't introduce...
Oh, no.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.960
SHE LAUGHS
That's right.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.160
You didn't.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.080
Flora Solomon did.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.600
Some friend she turned out to be.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.760
To Aileen, I mean.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.200
Shall we say an hour for lunch?

31:54.240 --> 31:56.640
RINGING

31:56.680 --> 31:58.120
Yeah?

31:59.240 --> 32:00.720
You got a pen?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.000
Hang on.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.480
All right. Got it. Go ahead.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.000
'19 Spencer Square, Kensington.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.080
'19 Spencer Square, Kensington.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.920
'I need Ian in that house
as soon as you can get him there.'

32:14.960 --> 32:16.320
Got it.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.720
CLEARS THROAT

32:34.680 --> 32:36.840
Why are you communist?

32:41.800 --> 32:43.520
Several reasons.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.640
Beginning when I was a boy
and witness to my father's rage

32:47.680 --> 32:51.600
at how the British betrayed
the Arabs between the wars.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.960
Not why you are angry
with the British.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.440
Why you are communist.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.720
Then when I was at university,
up at Cambridge,

33:00.760 --> 33:05.800
I had an economics professor
who was profoundly offended

33:05.840 --> 33:10.480
by the predicament of the workers
in the industrial north of England.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.360
Tell me about Vienna.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.680
What?
In 1934.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.960
Tell me about Litzi Friedmann.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.520
ANNOUNCEMENT OUTSIDE

34:50.920 --> 34:52.200
What?

34:53.520 --> 34:55.840
No, no. You go.
I'll stay. Give me the gun.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.760
So, it starts for you
with romantic adventure.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.280
It started for me
as the only way to fight fascism.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.840
Romanticism is a weakness.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.880
PANTING

36:20.600 --> 36:21.920
Kim...

36:21.960 --> 36:24.000
Kim, stop. Stop.

36:26.960 --> 36:31.120
This is our first time,
not our last.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.280
QUIET CHATTERING

37:44.040 --> 37:45.640
Wake up.

37:56.880 --> 38:00.280
QUIET TALKING

38:00.320 --> 38:03.240
THEY SPEAK IN OWN LANGUAGE

38:14.080 --> 38:16.880
He is Directorate
of Agriculture Inspector.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.360
Son of military officer.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.560
Wearing handmade shoes from England.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.880
Drink.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.040
I don't want another drink.
Drink.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.080
How do you know
those are English shoes?

38:29.320 --> 38:30.880
How do you not know?

38:30.920 --> 38:35.280
They were gift to his father from a
British officer at the end of war.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.000
And you believe that?

38:37.040 --> 38:39.720
You know who doesn't wear
English shoes in Russia?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.120
An English spy.

38:50.760 --> 38:54.560
Does the name Konstantin Dmitrievich
Volkov mean anything to you?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.880
What has this to do with
English shoes?

38:56.920 --> 38:58.960
Nothing.
Have you heard of him or not?

39:00.960 --> 39:02.040
No.

39:04.160 --> 39:07.840
When the war against Germany
was all but won

39:07.880 --> 39:11.000
and new battle lines were being
drawn between East and West,

39:11.000 --> 39:11.240
and new battle lines were being
drawn between East and West,

39:11.280 --> 39:15.600
there were, I'm sorry to say,
many from the Soviet Union

39:15.640 --> 39:18.160
who had succumbed
to the temptations,

39:18.200 --> 39:21.920
during their wartime postings,
of the West.

39:21.960 --> 39:26.000
One such person was
Konstantin Dmitrievich Volkov...

39:26.040 --> 39:28.680
who had spent most of the war
in Istanbul

39:28.720 --> 39:33.520
as the deputy chief of
Soviet intelligence in Turkey.

39:34.720 --> 39:38.040
But now he wanted SIS
to help him defect

39:38.080 --> 39:41.000
in return for a list
of Soviet agents in Britain,

39:41.000 --> 39:42.080
in return for a list
of Soviet agents in Britain,

39:42.120 --> 39:44.160
including, he claimed,

39:44.200 --> 39:47.840
an agent who had penetrated
the uppermost echelons

39:47.880 --> 39:50.040
of the foreign intelligence service.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.560
You.

39:53.440 --> 39:59.360
Two years before that, in '42, while
Nicholas Elliott was in Istanbul,

39:59.400 --> 40:04.200
he and Volkov crossed paths
as allies against the Nazis.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.560
Which is why Volkov insisted Elliott

40:07.600 --> 40:11.000
be summoned back to Istanbul
to run his exfiltration.

40:11.000 --> 40:11.360
be summoned back to Istanbul
to run his exfiltration.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.640
As luck would have it,
I had, by that time,

40:14.680 --> 40:18.360
risen to head of
Soviet Counter Espionage in London.

40:19.640 --> 40:22.480
And so Volkov's
somewhat amateurish approach

40:22.520 --> 40:25.120
to the British vice-consul
in Istanbul

40:25.160 --> 40:27.560
was relayed directly to me at SIS...

40:27.600 --> 40:29.360
Where is Mr Elliott?

40:29.400 --> 40:32.360
..without Elliott ever knowing
the first thing about it.

40:36.280 --> 40:40.240
I specifically asked for Mr Elliott.
Who are you?

40:51.080 --> 40:53.600
I'm... so very sorry.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.880
SIGHS

41:01.000 --> 41:02.160
I tell a lie.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.640
Luck had nothing at all
to do with it.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.600
Romantic adventure or not...

41:11.840 --> 41:14.400
..you can imagine
why it might irritate me

41:14.440 --> 41:17.640
to be condescended to by someone who
hasn't bothered to do his homework.

41:31.800 --> 41:34.640
SPEAKS WITH LISP: Loving Father,
we thank you for your servant Moses,

41:34.680 --> 41:37.080
who led your people
through the waters of the Red Sea

41:37.120 --> 41:39.520
to freedom in the promised land.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.000
We thank you for your son Jesus,

41:41.040 --> 41:43.760
who has passed through
the deep waters of death

41:43.800 --> 41:47.040
and opened for all
the way of salvation.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.160
Now send your spirit

41:49.200 --> 41:54.280
that those who are washed
in this water may die with Christ

41:54.320 --> 41:55.760
and rise with him...

41:55.800 --> 41:57.560
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

41:57.600 --> 41:59.000
Not the foggiest.

41:59.000 --> 41:59.480
Not the foggiest.

41:59.520 --> 42:02.320
..alive in Christ forever.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.560
Creator God,

42:05.600 --> 42:08.480
we thank you for
the gift of the life of this child

42:08.520 --> 42:10.560
who is to be baptised.

42:10.600 --> 42:15.440
May your blessing of peace and joy
be with them and protect them

42:15.480 --> 42:16.920
for all their days.

42:16.960 --> 42:20.760
We make this prayer
in the name of your son Jesus.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.000
She back from lunch yet?
Just rang.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.160
She back from lunch yet?
Just rang.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.440
She's been summoned back to MI5
for the rest of the day.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.960

43:04.040 --> 43:05.720

44:59.400 --> 45:02.160
Good Lord!
No, only me.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.080
Crikey, is that...

45:07.120 --> 45:08.760
That can't be Willie?

45:10.160 --> 45:12.680
What on Earth would MI6
ever do without you?

45:12.720 --> 45:14.720
No, this is Dickie!

45:14.760 --> 45:15.920
Course it is.

45:15.960 --> 45:18.640
Willie's grandson.
Stop it!

45:18.680 --> 45:20.720
Dickie's slightly bigger
than Willie.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.240
Come on.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.160
I've been wondering
when you might appear.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.480
DICKIE WHINES

45:38.520 --> 45:42.240
Dickie. Dickie, come on,
come to Mummy.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.760
Come on.

45:48.120 --> 45:52.800
I want you to know how awful I feel
about this whole business with...

45:52.840 --> 45:54.560
Kim?

45:56.680 --> 45:59.000
'How long have you known?'
'What difference does it make now?'

45:59.000 --> 46:01.320
'How long have you known?'
'What difference does it make now?'

46:02.960 --> 46:06.680
'We almost caught him in '45,
you know.' 'Really?'

46:06.720 --> 46:11.800
Chap called Volkov.
Konstantin Dmitrievich Volkov.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.520
Almost gave him up to us.
What happened?

46:19.960 --> 46:21.960
Bit muddy on the details.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.160
But what I came to talk to you about
happened four years earlier...

46:27.120 --> 46:29.000
..when you asked me to find out
if Kim was cheating on Aileen.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.920
..when you asked me to find out
if Kim was cheating on Aileen.

46:31.960 --> 46:36.240
It wasn't adultery that you were
trying to steer me towards, was it?

46:37.480 --> 46:43.240
Please try to understand, Aileen was
heavily pregnant at the time.

46:43.280 --> 46:45.000
You already knew.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.920
Knew what?
Flora...

46:47.960 --> 46:50.840
That he was a communist?
That he was KGB.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.920
Oh!
I didn't know anything of the sort.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.360
Not then.

46:55.400 --> 46:59.000
Why on Earth did you introduce
Aileen to Kim in the first place?

46:59.000 --> 46:59.640
Why on Earth did you introduce
Aileen to Kim in the first place?

46:59.680 --> 47:03.160
Cos he was eligible and witty.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.720
And a communist.

47:04.760 --> 47:06.760
That was at Cambridge.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.080
SHE CLEARS THROAT

47:08.120 --> 47:11.760
And Kim wasn't the only one that
dabbled with communism. We all did.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.920
I didn't.
Don't be obtuse, Nick.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.160
'A lot of people flirted with it.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.160
'A lot of people flirted
with lots of things at university.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.320
'It's what young people do,

47:23.360 --> 47:26.800
'most of whom go on to be
utterly respectable and normal.'

47:26.840 --> 47:29.000
Well, you must remind me to ask you
for a list of those people one day.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.240
Well, you must remind me to ask you
for a list of those people one day.

47:31.280 --> 47:36.320
I introduced Kim and Aileen
to each other...

47:37.960 --> 47:40.520
..because, for my sins,

47:40.560 --> 47:43.840
I like to believe
the best in my friends.

47:43.880 --> 47:46.760
Surely you, of all people,
can understand that.

47:48.120 --> 47:53.280
And in Kim's case, it
was just impossible to believe...

47:53.320 --> 47:56.280
Because he was so eligible
and witty (!)

47:56.320 --> 47:59.000
If I'd known
he was spying for Russia

47:59.000 --> 47:59.080
If I'd known
he was spying for Russia

47:59.120 --> 48:00.760
I would have said something
back then.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.920
You'd started to suspect, though,
hadn't you?

48:02.960 --> 48:04.560
Which is why you asked me
to spy on him.

48:04.600 --> 48:07.280
And you bloody well missed it!

48:12.840 --> 48:14.160
Say I had cottoned on...

48:16.720 --> 48:18.440
..to what Kim was really up to...

48:21.000 --> 48:22.800
..what were you expecting me
to do about it?

48:24.480 --> 48:25.560
You were his friend.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.080
His good and loyal friend.

48:28.120 --> 48:29.000
And as long as we were
still at war with Germany,

48:29.000 --> 48:30.040
And as long as we were
still at war with Germany,

48:30.080 --> 48:32.440
Russia was technically our ally.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.880
Ah. You were expecting me
to change his mind,

48:34.920 --> 48:37.000
convince him
of the error of his ways...

48:37.040 --> 48:39.960
Before it was too late.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Flora!

48:40.000 --> 48:42.840
I-I was also trying
to protect Aileen.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.240
I thought you'd understand that.

48:44.280 --> 48:47.080
And I knew you'd do the same
for Kim.

48:47.120 --> 48:49.920
I wasn't going to just
blurt out suspicions

48:49.960 --> 48:52.320
and accusations in case I was wrong!

48:52.360 --> 48:55.200
Especially not after
the way you reacted

48:55.240 --> 48:57.760
to my suggestion
he was having an affair.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.680
Do you even remember that?

49:03.960 --> 49:05.840
She was his KGB cut out.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.440
'Who?'

49:13.600 --> 49:15.080
Not just his mistress.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.600
Who?

49:19.200 --> 49:20.560
Litzi.

49:24.360 --> 49:26.800
What did Kim tell you in Beirut?

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Tell me about what?

49:29.000 --> 49:29.680
Tell me about what?

49:29.720 --> 49:33.680
You seriously expect me to believe
you'd just let him go scot-free

49:33.720 --> 49:35.800
without getting
something from him first?

49:38.000 --> 49:39.320
'You may fool others,

49:39.360 --> 49:41.520
'but you can't pull the wool
over these eyes.

49:42.800 --> 49:45.880
'Do you want to know
what he once told me about you?'

49:45.920 --> 49:48.640
He said that at any given moment

49:48.680 --> 49:52.160
you're far more switched on
than you let on...

49:53.360 --> 49:56.520
..which is what makes you
so dangerous.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.400
He said that?

50:00.960 --> 50:04.400
Tell me you'll make something
of all this, Nick.

50:06.400 --> 50:10.640
That in the end, you were, in fact,
always one step ahead of him.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.880
Lovely to see you again, Flora.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.200
Liar.

50:34.680 --> 50:36.880

She's talking to you.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.160
Hello.

51:50.960 --> 51:53.480
Tovarishch Soboreva.

51:58.680 --> 51:59.000
What did she call me?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.120
What did she call me?

52:00.160 --> 52:03.000
Comrade Colonel. That is your rank.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.120
Does she speak English?

52:05.160 --> 52:06.600
Pakhnet supom?

52:06.640 --> 52:08.880
Svinina s kartoshkoy.

52:08.920 --> 52:12.320
She has made soup. Potato and pork.

52:28.640 --> 52:29.000
Does she speak English?
You will learn Russian.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.800
Does she speak English?
You will learn Russian.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.680
Is she KGB?

52:37.720 --> 52:39.800
She's comrade. Friend.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.440
Soup.

53:01.960 --> 53:05.200
What's the matter?
Nothing.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.680
Don't worry about it.

53:16.680 --> 53:19.080
Are you coming to bed?
I'll be up in a minute.

53:24.120 --> 53:26.480
'Do you remember that day?'

53:26.520 --> 53:29.000
'Yeah.'

53:29.000 --> 53:29.120
'Yeah.'

53:29.160 --> 53:31.080
Still newlyweds.

53:37.320 --> 53:43.160
It's just that sometimes I feel
we live in two separate worlds...

53:46.280 --> 53:50.320
..and every now and again,
sort of meet in the middle.

53:53.200 --> 53:59.000
And occasionally you will tell me
a little about someone or something,

53:59.000 --> 53:59.720
And occasionally you will tell me
a little about someone or something,

53:59.760 --> 54:02.640
like the man that didn't know
his friend was lying to him

54:02.680 --> 54:04.480
for over 20 years, but...

54:06.280 --> 54:08.440
..but sometimes, if I'm honest...

54:10.120 --> 54:12.520
..I worry how well I know you.

54:21.400 --> 54:24.240
I just love you, you know?

54:27.080 --> 54:29.000
And I never want to lose you.

54:29.000 --> 54:29.120
And I never want to lose you.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.720
Lose me?

54:33.440 --> 54:34.800
Gosh, man!

54:36.480 --> 54:38.520
Are you joking?

54:49.920 --> 54:54.040
Every day, when I get to work,
I take my wedding ring off...

54:55.520 --> 54:59.000
..and I-I put it in the box that
it came in when you proposed to me.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.360
..and I-I put it in the box that
it came in when you proposed to me.

55:01.400 --> 55:06.080
And every night, on the train home,
I put it back on.

55:07.440 --> 55:08.960
Why do you take it off?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.080
Because...

55:17.240 --> 55:20.120
..I-I love putting it on!

56:42.040 --> 56:44.280
Did you remember to get cigarettes?

56:44.320 --> 56:47.160
Shit. Slipped my mind. Sorry.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.240
Goddamn it!

56:53.360 --> 56:55.680
One day
you'll get a sense of humour.

57:21.840 --> 57:26.480
MORSE CODE TAPPED OUT

58:24.120 --> 58:25.480
