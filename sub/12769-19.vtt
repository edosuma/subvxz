HOW WAS SEATTLE?

00:17.583 --> 00:19.500
IT WAS GOOD.

00:19.542 --> 00:22.041
IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE WEIRD
GOING BACK, BUT IT WAS GOOD.

LIKE YOU'RE MAKING HIM WAIT
TO SEE YOU

00:39.083 --> 00:41.041
BECAUSE IT'S EXTRA HOT
TO DELAY HOMECOMING SEX,

00:41.083 --> 00:44.041

I GAVE HIM A CHOICE
BEFORE I LEFT.

01:02.834 --> 01:06.834
WHY AREN'T YOU READY TO GO?
WE'RE ALREADY LATE.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.041
THESE WEDDING INVITATIONS WERE
SUPPOSED TO GO OUT A WEEK AGO.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.625
WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND 'EM?
I'LL START ON 'EM TODAY,
OKAY?

01:11.667 --> 01:14.625
NO, NOT OKAY. WE'RE FALLING
BEHIND. IF YOU HAD SENT THEM,

01:14.667 --> 01:17.041
I COULD'VE TOLD MY MOTHER IT WAS
TOO LATE TO INVITE AUNT ZELDA,

01:17.083 --> 01:19.041
BUT NOW SHE APOLOGIZED
TO MY MOTHER

01:19.083 --> 01:21.166
FOR SAYING THAT HER BRISKET
WAS TOO TOUGH,

01:21.208 --> 01:23.792
AND NOW WE HAVE TO INVITE HER.
FINE. SHE CAN SIT NEXT TO
BUSTER HODGES.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.750

MAMA WANTS TO ADD HIM.

IT'S NO ONE.
WHOA.
NO ONE THAT YOU KEPT...

01:49.333 --> 01:52.542
COME ON.

02:09.291 --> 02:12.250
YOU SERIOUSLY WANT TO
DISCUSS THIS?
YOU MADE ME THROW OUT PICTURES
OF EVERY GIRL I EVER LOOKED AT,

02:12.291 --> 02:15.125
AND I DID IT BECAUSE I ASSUMED,
IF I DIDN'T,

02:15.166 --> 02:18.166

I STILL HAD FEELINGS FOR THEM.

AND...

03:23.792 --> 03:25.750

03:25.792 --> 03:28.834
YOU NEED TO DECIDE.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.792
AND IN THE MEANTIME?

03:33.667 --> 03:36.041
YOU HAVE A SINGLES TABLE
WHEN YOU'RE 25

03:36.083 --> 03:38.041
AND STILL WANT
TO SET YOUR FRIENDS UP.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.500
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF BUBBA'S COMING ALONE--

03:40.542 --> 03:43.625

WHATEVER. IF HE'S COMING ALONE,
AND AUNT ZELDA IS COMING ALONE--

03:43.667 --> 03:45.500
ARE WE ALLOWED TO BRING
A DATE TO YOUR WEDDING?

03:45.542 --> 03:47.583

ARE YOU BRINGING ANYONE?

SOMEONE SPECIAL

THAT I REALLY WANT TO BRING,
SOMEONE I'M HAPPILY DATING,

04:02.625 --> 04:04.583
PERHAPS A FELLOW THERAPIST/
BOOK REVIEWER?

04:04.625 --> 04:06.041
UNFORTUNATELY, NO, I DON'T.

04:06.083 --> 04:08.041
WELL, YOU LIKE SOUTHERN ACCENTS,
DON'T YOU, SHELDON?

04:08.083 --> 04:10.500
I'M SURE CHARLOTTE HAS SOME
FRIENDS THAT YOU COULD DATE.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.166
YES, AND SOME OF THEM
EVEN HAVE ALL THEIR TEETH.

HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?
(Violet) HEY.

I MANAGED TO SAFELY DELIVER

04:20.583 --> 04:22.542

AND, YEAH,

04:22.583 --> 04:24.333

SIGNS FOR ALL THE PACKAGES.

OF COURSE NOT.

DOCTORS HAVE CERTAIN
OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR PATIENTS

05:51.583 --> 05:53.750
EVEN AFTER THEY FINISH
CARING FOR THEM.
NO, THOSE RIGHTS DISAPPEARED

05:53.792 --> 05:56.750
WHEN SHE WALKED INTO
OUR LIVING ROOM AND--
PETE.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.041
NO, SHE'S A CRIMINAL!
SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN PUT AWAY

05:59.083 --> 06:01.542
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.
I AGREE. NO COURT IS GONNA
SIDE WITH HER ON THIS.

06:01.583 --> 06:05.583
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I'M GONNA
GET OUR LAWYER ON THE PHONE.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.583
(Sheldon) PETE. HANG ON.
BACK OFF, SHELDON.

06:07.625 --> 06:11.041
EVEN THOUGH VIOLET CHANGED
KATIE'S NAME IN THE BOOK,

06:11.083 --> 06:13.458
SHE DOES STILL TALK ABOUT
KATIE'S PERSONAL TRAUMA--
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

06:13.500 --> 06:15.458
THAT ANYONE WHO'S SEEN
THE LOCAL NEWS

06:15.500 --> 06:18.041
OR READ A PAPER OR USES GOOGLE
IS GONNA KNOW

06:18.083 --> 06:20.542
THAT KATIE'S THE ONE THAT
VIOLET'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT.
ARE YOU SIDING WITH KATIE?

06:20.583 --> 06:23.041
OF COURSE NOT, BUT WE HAVE TO
CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT

06:23.083 --> 06:24.750
THAT THE DOCTOR-PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY

06:24.792 --> 06:26.583
MIGHT HAVE BEEN VIOLATED.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.625
VIOLET IS NOT
NECESSARILY INNOCENT HERE.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.083
I DID NOTHING WRONG.

06:30.125 --> 06:33.000
AND SHAME ON YOU
FOR SAYING OTHERWISE.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.041
(indistinct conversations)

06:38.083 --> 06:41.041
VAL. HEY. WE DIDN'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT TODAY, DID WE?

06:41.083 --> 06:43.041
UH, IT'S NOT A BABY THING.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.041
DR. BENNETT WAS DOING
HIS ROUTINE CHECKUP,

06:45.083 --> 06:48.000
AND HE NOTICED MY GLANDS WERE
SWOLLEN, SO HE DID A BIOPSY.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.500
HE SAID
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,

06:49.542 --> 06:51.500
BUT JUST IN CASE,
I'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR

06:51.542 --> 06:54.417
WHO GARY CAN AND CANNOT MARRY
THE SECOND TIME AROUND.
THERE'S A LIST.

06:54.458 --> 06:57.458
HEY, GUYS. I, UH,
I HAVE VAL'S RESULTS.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.583
YOU WANT TO STEP
INTO MY OFFICE?

07:00.625 --> 07:03.959
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.208
UH, VAL HAS
BURKITT'S LYMPHOMA.

07:10.250 --> 07:14.000
THAT'S CANCER
OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.417
HOW...
HOW BAD IS IT?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.709
WELL, GIVEN THAT THERE
WAS NO EVIDENCE OF IT

07:23.750 --> 07:25.709
ON HER LAST VISIT,
IT MEANS IT IS AGGRESSIVE,

07:25.750 --> 07:28.208
SO WE SHOULD GET YOU
INTO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY

07:28.250 --> 07:29.917
AND DO SOME MORE TESTING.

07:29.959 --> 07:33.041
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.041
HONEY, WHAT DO YOU ALWAYS
TELL ME?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.917
DON'T BORROW TROUBLE.

07:36.959 --> 07:39.041
WE CAN FIGHT THIS.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.125
SO WHAT, SURGERY?

07:42.166 --> 07:44.125
WELL,
WITH THIS TYPE OF CANCER,

07:44.166 --> 07:46.542
SURGERY AND RADIATION
ARE NOT VIABLE OPTIONS.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.041
CHEMO HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVE,

07:48.083 --> 07:50.875
BUT CANNOT BE ADMINISTERED
WHILE YOU'RE PREGNANT.

07:50.917 --> 07:54.500
OKAY, SO I-IN A FEW MONTHS--
NO, WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.750
WE SHOULD DELIVER THE BABY
RIGHT AWAY.
I'M ONLY AT 25 WEEKS.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.667
I KNOW,
BUT THE BABY IS VIABLE.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.166
(clears throat)

08:02.208 --> 08:04.959
DR. BENNETT,
YOU DON'T AGREE?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.041
WELL, IF YOU DELIVER
YOUR SON NOW,

08:07.083 --> 08:09.041
UH, HE'S LIKELY TO HAVE
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS--

08:09.083 --> 08:12.542
NEUROLOGICAL, MUSCULAR,
HIS SIGHT COULD BE IMPAIRED--

08:12.583 --> 08:15.041
AND THAT'S ASSUMING
THAT HE SURVIVES.
HE COULD DIE?

08:15.083 --> 08:17.500
YES, BUT SO COULD YOU.
VAL...

08:17.542 --> 08:19.834
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
A HORRIBLE CHOICE

08:19.875 --> 08:21.542
TO HAVE TO MAKE, BUT--

08:21.583 --> 08:24.834
THERE IS NO CHOICE.
WE CAN TRY AGAIN.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.375
(sighs)

08:26.417 --> 08:29.083
BUT RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE GOTTA WORRY ABOUT YOU.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.542
NO.
Y--

08:30.583 --> 08:32.583
NOT THIS TIME.

08:32.625 --> 08:36.750
AFTER ALL THE MISCARRIAGES
AND LEAVING WORK AND BED REST...

08:36.792 --> 08:38.792
WE DID EVERYTHING
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO--

08:38.834 --> 08:40.583
EVERYTHING.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.041
WE CAN'T START OVER NOW.

08:44.083 --> 08:47.125
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME
AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.625
NO.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.625
I'M CARRYING THIS BABY
TO TERM.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.041
(sniffles)
I CHOOSE HIM...

08:53.083 --> 08:56.000
EVEN IF IT KILLS ME.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.041
SAM, WE ALWAYS SAVE
THE MOTHER FIRST.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.041
VAL IS MAKING
THE WRONG CHOICE HERE,

09:06.083 --> 09:08.792
AND HER CANCER
IS SPREADING FAST.

09:08.834 --> 09:11.166
MAYBE, BUT EVERY DAY MAKES
A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THIS BABY.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.625
RIGHT NOW
HIS LUNGS HAVEN'T MATURED.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.041
HIS VISUAL AND AUDITORY SYSTEMS
ARE STILL DEVELOPING.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.917
BUT IF WE WAIT
JUST TWO WEEKS,

09:18.959 --> 09:21.041
THE CHANCES OF HIM SURVIVING
INCREASE 80%.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.041
IN TWO WEEKS,
VAL WILL BE MUCH WORSE.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.000
SHE'S BECOMING HYPERMETABOLIC,

09:25.041 --> 09:27.041
AND THE CANCER IS ALREADY
OVERTAKING HER SYSTEM.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.917
GUYS, HANG ON. IF THIS WOMAN
WERE HEMORRHAGING

09:29.959 --> 09:31.667
AND A SPLIT-SECOND DECISION
NEEDED TO BE MADE,

09:31.709 --> 09:34.041
IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER, BUT IN
THIS CASE, SHE'S CONSCIOUS.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.041
I MEAN, SHE'S AWARE.
IT'S HER BODY.
THANK YOU.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.166
IT'S HER LIFE. IF SHE WANTS TO
GIVE IT UP FOR HER BABY,

09:38.208 --> 09:41.083
THAT IS HER CHOICE.
WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS
OR INTRATHECAL CHEMO

09:41.125 --> 09:44.500
ADMINISTERED IMMEDIATELY,
VAL WILL DIE.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.500
OKAY. SO LET ME UNDERSTAND.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.542
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
EVEN THOUGH THIS WOMAN

09:48.583 --> 09:52.291
HAS EXPLICITLY STATED THE FACT
THAT SHE WANTS TO HAVE A CHILD,

09:52.333 --> 09:55.542
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST--
SAM--

09:55.583 --> 09:58.709
YOU'RE SUGGESTING
THAT WE DISREGARD THAT.
IT IS NOT THE SAME.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.208
WELL, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE
IN THIS SITUATION,

10:01.250 --> 10:03.250
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO BE SAID.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.417
SO I TALKED TO THE LAWYER.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.500
HE THINKS KATIE
MIGHT HAVE A CASE.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.125
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:17.166 --> 10:19.667
I'M GONNA FIND EVERY REFERENCE
TO KATIE IN THE BOOK,

10:19.709 --> 10:22.041
AND I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT
IF I VIOLATED ANY PRIVILEGE.

10:22.083 --> 10:25.000
LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY
ABOUT THIS. WE'RE GONNA FIGHT--
I CAN HANDLE THIS, PETE.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.542
JUST GIVE A MINUTE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL...

10:27.583 --> 10:29.041
(sighs) I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.375
I JUST NEVER EXPECTED THIS
TO HAPPEN.

10:31.417 --> 10:34.041
HOW COULD YOU?
I MEAN, I-I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.083
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO HURT KATIE.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.792
AND YET...

10:39.834 --> 10:41.917
I THINK
I SHOULD GO TALK TO HER.

10:41.959 --> 10:45.041
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
SHE'S DANGEROUS.

10:45.083 --> 10:48.041
MAYBE WE COULD COME
TO SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING.
OH, FOR GOD SAKE, VIOLET.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

10:48.083 --> 10:50.583
A RESTRAINING ORDER
AGAINST HER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.583
PETE, SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
THE SAME KATIE.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.542
I MEAN, NO,
IF THEY'RE LETTING HER OUT,

10:54.583 --> 10:56.125
THAT MEANS
SHE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK

10:56.166 --> 10:58.041
AND SHE'S READY
TO REINTEGRATE.

10:58.083 --> 11:01.041
I'M SURE SHE HAS A THERAPIST
AND A DRUG REGIMEN AND...
VIOLET--

11:01.083 --> 11:04.041
SHE'LL BE CLOSER TO THE KATIE
I KNEW WHEN I WORKED WITH HER.
YEAH, AND LOOK HOW WELL
THAT TURNED OUT.

11:04.083 --> 11:07.041
SHE KNOWS ME. PETE, NO.
AND WHATEVER ELSE HAS HAPPENED,

11:07.083 --> 11:09.041
THAT DOCTOR-PATIENT DYNAMIC
IS STILL IN PLACE,

11:09.083 --> 11:12.041
AND THAT MEANS MAYBE
I COULD GET THROUGH TO HER.
LET THE LAWYERS HANDLE IT.

11:12.083 --> 11:15.041
NO, THAT'S JUST GONNA
ALIENATE HER EVEN MORE.
VIOLET, REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOLD
ME TO SIT DOWN WITH MY MOTHER

11:15.083 --> 11:17.792
AND MAKE AMENDS
BEFORE SHE DIED?

11:17.834 --> 11:20.291
I WAS NOT THERE YET,
BUT I TRUSTED YOU.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.041
PLEASE TRUST ME.

11:22.083 --> 11:25.041
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY TO HER,
IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE THINGS.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.041
IT'S JUST
GONNA MAKE THINGS WORSE.

11:27.083 --> 11:30.875
I'M TELLING YOU,
LEAVE IT ALONE.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.041
(indistinct conversations)

11:35.083 --> 11:37.000
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:37.041 --> 11:38.667
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

11:38.709 --> 11:41.458
BETTER THAN GARY.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.041
(inhales deeply)
HE'S USUALLY THE CALM ONE.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.041
I NEED HIM TO BE
THE CALM ONE.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.875
GIVE HIM SOME TIME.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.583
I'M NOT GOOD AT THAT.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.458
THINK ABOUT WHAT I DO--
TRADING COMMODITIES.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.375
IT'S A FRANTIC BUSINESS.
IT NEVER STOPS.

11:55.417 --> 11:58.041
I NEVER STOPPED.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.041
UNTIL GARY MADE YOU?

12:00.083 --> 12:02.500
THE BABY MADE ME.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.500
AND GARY, I GUESS...

12:04.542 --> 12:08.041
WELL, HE MADE IT POSSIBLE.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

12:10.125 --> 12:13.041
ON OUR FIRST DATE, HE TOLD ME
THAT HE WAS REALLY OKAY

12:13.083 --> 12:15.041
BEING WITH A WOMAN
WHO HAD A CAREER,

12:15.083 --> 12:20.041
BUT THAT NO KIDS
WOULD BE A DEAL BREAKER.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.041
I PROMISED HIM.

12:22.083 --> 12:25.083
I CAN RELATE.

12:25.125 --> 12:28.583
SOMETIMES, WANTING A BABY,
IT'S, UH...

12:28.625 --> 12:31.208
WELL, IT'S LIKE
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.583
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU TWO HAVE BEEN THROUGH

12:34.625 --> 12:37.667
AND THAT YOU COULD DIE.

12:37.709 --> 12:40.917
YEAH...
I GUESS I COULD.

12:40.959 --> 12:44.834
VAL, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

12:44.875 --> 12:47.041
I WANT TO GIVE GARY
A BABY.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.125
AND YOU'VE TRIED,
BUT I--

12:49.166 --> 12:51.041
IS GARY PRESSURING YOU?

12:51.083 --> 12:53.041
NO, NO. IT'S NOT THAT.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.959
IT'S JUST...

12:59.000 --> 13:03.041
I DID SOMETHING ONCE,
AND, UH...

13:03.083 --> 13:04.542
WHAT?

13:04.583 --> 13:07.083
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO,

13:07.125 --> 13:09.375
GARY AND I HAD SETTLED
INTO BEING MARRIED.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.250
I PASSED MY SERIES 3,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.250
AND I WAS FINALLY
GETTING A SHOT

13:13.291 --> 13:15.250
TO TRADE WITH THE BIG BOYS.

13:15.291 --> 13:18.041
I WAS STRESSED
AND I WASN'T EATING,

13:18.083 --> 13:21.750
SO... I WASN'T WORRIED WHEN I
MISSED A COUPLE OF PERIODS,

13:21.792 --> 13:23.917
BUT...

13:23.959 --> 13:25.959
(sighs)

13:26.000 --> 13:27.959
YOU CAN'T BECOME
ONE OF THE GUYS

13:28.000 --> 13:31.875
AND THEN WALK AROUND
WITH A BABY INSIDE YOU.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.792
YOU HAD AN ABORTION.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.667
DID YOU TELL GARY?
I COULDN'T.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.583
WELL, YOU'VE GOTTA
TELL HIM NOW.

13:41.625 --> 13:45.041
I MEAN, THAT WAS YEARS AGO.
HE WON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.041
MAYBE NOT AT FIRST, BUT YOU'LL
HELP HIM TO UNDERSTAND.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.959
NOT A LIE LIKE THIS.
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GONNA
BE EASY, ALL RIGHT?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.834
BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T TELL,
IF YOU CONTINUE TO HIDE THIS?

13:52.875 --> 13:56.083
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'LL DO
TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP? VAL?
(gasping)

13:56.125 --> 13:58.959
VAL, TALK TO ME.
I NEED HELP IN HERE!
(continues gasping)

13:59.000 --> 14:02.041
LOOK AT ME.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS. BREATHE.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.041
(continues gasping)

14:04.083 --> 14:07.000
BREATHE. GOOD.
OKAY, OKAY, BREATHE.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.166
(sighs)

14:10.208 --> 14:11.500
HEY.

14:11.542 --> 14:13.000
UM...

14:13.041 --> 14:14.834
(sighs)

14:14.875 --> 14:18.333
ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE
WITH BILLY?

14:18.375 --> 14:20.208
WHAT?
YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

14:20.250 --> 14:23.041
DO YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HIM OR...

14:23.083 --> 14:26.041
HE BROKE MY HEART, COOPER.
RIGHT.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.834
BUT YOU KEPT HIS PICTURE UNTIL,
YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING. WHY?

14:28.875 --> 14:30.583
YOU REALLY
CAN'T LET THIS GO?

14:30.625 --> 14:33.041
HONESTLY, NO. YOU'RE DRAGGING
YOUR FEET ON THE WEDDING,

14:33.083 --> 14:35.458
THE INVITATIONS STILL HAVEN'T
GONE OUT, AND EVERY TIME

14:35.500 --> 14:37.959
I BRING IT UP, YOU LOOK AT ME
LIKE I'M THE CRAZY ONE.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
AND NOW THERE'S THIS PHOTO.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.417
LOOK... (sighs) I FOUND IT
A FEW WEEKS AGO

14:42.458 --> 14:44.959
WHEN WE STARTED
THE INVITATIONS.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.250
I DON'T KNOW WHY I KEPT IT.
I JUST DID.

14:48.291 --> 14:51.041
SO DOES HE STILL
MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU?

14:51.083 --> 14:53.709
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

14:53.750 --> 14:56.041
ALL I KNOW IS, WE'RE ABOUT
TO START THIS LIFE TOGETHER,

14:56.083 --> 14:58.041
AND THIS FEELS WEIRD.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.041
SO WHAT, Y-Y-YOU WANT
TO BREAK UP WITH ME?

15:00.083 --> 15:01.667
MAYBE CALL OFF OUR WEDDING?

15:01.709 --> 15:03.208
OF COURSE NOT.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.875
I JUST WANT
TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

15:05.917 --> 15:08.417
IT'S HISTORY.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.208
IT'S DONE.

15:13.417 --> 15:16.166
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT--
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.792
(Sam)
IT'S CALLED S.V.C. SYNDROME.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.041
IT'S A BLOCKAGE OF THE VESSELS
THAT DRAIN THE NECK AND HEAD.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.083
IT'S CAUSING PRESSURE
AND LACK OF OXYGEN

15:23.125 --> 15:25.041
TO THOSE AREAS.

15:25.083 --> 15:28.041
YOU COULD STOP BREATHING.
IS THIS
BECAUSE OF THE CANCER?

15:28.083 --> 15:31.041
IT IS. THIS IS WHY WE NEED
TO START TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.959
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.542
PLEASE, BABY.
I CAN'T LOSE YOU.

15:36.583 --> 15:40.417
I NEED TO COME HOME
AND HEAR ABOUT YOUR CRAZY DAY

15:40.458 --> 15:43.041
WITH THE MOUTH BREATHERS
AT YOUR OFFICE.

15:43.083 --> 15:47.208
I NEED TO REPLANT OUR GARDEN
EVERY YEAR AND SURPRISE YOU.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.125
YOU NEED TO BE A DAD.

15:50.166 --> 15:54.041
NOT ALONE. I DON'T WANT
TO DO IT ALONE.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.917
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:55.959 --> 15:59.166
DO SOMETHING.
VAL...

15:59.208 --> 16:02.041
DR. MONTGOMERY,
DON'T DO THIS.

16:02.083 --> 16:06.000
YOU TWO HAVE A DEAL, RIGHT,
THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT?

16:17.166 --> 16:19.041
(sniffles)

16:19.083 --> 16:20.917
(sniffles)

16:20.959 --> 16:23.375
(crying) I...

16:25.083 --> 16:27.500
I HAD AN ABORTION.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.959
WHEN?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.959
I HAD JUST STARTED TRADING,
AND I COULDN'T.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.583
BUT I COULD'VE.

16:45.083 --> 16:48.041
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

16:48.083 --> 16:51.417
I WOULD'VE STAYED HOME.
I WOULD'VE DONE EVERYTHING.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.000
I'M SO SORRY.

16:53.041 --> 16:56.041
PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.166
(sniffles)

16:57.208 --> 17:00.000
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.542
(sniffles)

17:16.083 --> 17:17.750
(exhales)

17:17.792 --> 17:19.750
AM I COMPLETELY CRAZY
FOR DOING THIS?

17:19.792 --> 17:21.750
YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO ANSWER THAT?

17:21.792 --> 17:24.375
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT CRAZY,
BUT I KNOW YOU,

17:24.417 --> 17:27.041
AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO LET THIS GO,

17:27.083 --> 17:30.041
AND YOU THINK YOU CAN
HELP HER, SO...
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.542
OKAY. OKAY, I'M GONNA BE SITTING
RIGHT HERE WATCHING YOU,

17:32.583 --> 17:35.041
SO IF YOU FEEL THREATENED
AT ALL, YOU GIVE ME THE SIGN,

17:35.083 --> 17:36.875
AND I'M THERE.
(whispers) BYE.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.917
BYE.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.375
(indistinct conversations)

17:43.417 --> 17:46.417
(objects rattling)

17:56.959 --> 17:58.208
KATIE.

17:58.250 --> 18:01.458
(gasps)
OH, MY GOD. W--

18:01.500 --> 18:03.458
(whispering) WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:03.500 --> 18:06.166
YOU CAN'T--
(whispering) WE NEED TO TALK.
WE NEED TO TALK.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.917
NO, NO, NO. MY RESTRAINING
ORDER--I COULD GET IN TROUBLE.

18:08.959 --> 18:11.959
(normal voice) DON'T WORRY.
I CAME TO SEE YOU.
(lowered voice) THAT'S NOT
HOW THEY'LL SEE IT.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.041
YOU HAVE TO GO, NOW.
PLEASE. I JUST NEED--

18:14.083 --> 18:16.500
(sighs)
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.208
OH.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.208
(clatters)

18:27.250 --> 18:29.041
UM...

18:29.083 --> 18:32.041
UH... (clears throat)

18:32.083 --> 18:33.875
DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY THINK,

18:33.917 --> 18:36.125
I ALWAYS TRIED TO BE
A GOOD DOCTOR TO YOU.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.917
I ALWAYS WORKED WITH THE GOAL
OF GETTING YOU WELL.

18:38.959 --> 18:41.041
I EVEN KEPT YOU OUT OF JAIL

18:41.083 --> 18:44.667
SO THAT YOU COULD GET
THE TREATMENT THAT YOU NEEDED.
YES, AND I WILL ALWAYS
BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

18:44.709 --> 18:48.041
THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
WHY ARE YOU...

18:48.083 --> 18:49.959
ATTACKING ME AGAIN?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.917
I'M NOT ATTACKING YOU.

18:51.959 --> 18:54.000
I'M STANDING UP FOR MYSELF.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.542
I SPENT 18 MONTHS
IN AN INSTITUTION,

18:58.583 --> 19:02.000
WORKING ON MY RECOVERY,
DEALING WITH MY PAST

19:02.041 --> 19:05.083
AND ALL THE MISTAKES I MADE,
AND IT WAS HARD.

19:05.125 --> 19:08.083
BUT I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED
A FUTURE FOR MYSELF.

19:08.125 --> 19:12.041
AND THEN WHEN I GOT OUT,
I-I DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.000
I GOT A THERAPIST,
I GOT THIS JOB.

19:14.041 --> 19:17.542
I-I EVEN MET A GUY--
JUSTIN...

19:17.583 --> 19:20.834
A REALLY GREAT GUY.

19:20.875 --> 19:25.000
HE HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS
OR WHAT I HAD DONE.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.125
HE JUST CARED ABOUT ME--

19:27.166 --> 19:30.000
THIS ME. (chuckles)

19:30.041 --> 19:32.333
AND THEN...

19:32.375 --> 19:35.375
JUSTIN'S SISTER...

19:35.417 --> 19:37.709
SHE READ YOUR BOOK.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.041
SHE READ YOUR BOOK

19:40.083 --> 19:42.834
AND... SHE PUT IT TOGETHER.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.333
AND SHE TOLD HIM,

19:44.375 --> 19:47.709
AND HE WAS...

19:47.750 --> 19:50.667
HE WAS GONE SO FAST.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.041
DO YOU UNDERSTAND

19:55.083 --> 19:57.417
WHAT...

19:57.458 --> 19:59.417
WHAT YOUR BOOK
IS DOING TO ME?

19:59.458 --> 20:01.417
IT'S--IT'S TAKING AWAY
MY CLEAN START.

20:01.458 --> 20:05.041
I-I CHANGED THE NAME. I TRIED
TO PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY.
PEOPLE READ THE NEWSPAPER,

20:05.083 --> 20:07.792
THEY WATCH THE NEWS,
THEY REMEMBER WHAT I DID.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.792
IT'S NOT HARD TO PUT TOGETHER
THOSE STORIES WITH THE BOOK.
THE BOOK IS THE STORY
OF MY LIFE,

20:10.834 --> 20:12.792
OF ALL THE THINGS
THAT HAPPENED TO ME.

20:12.834 --> 20:16.041
AND THAT NIGHT, WHAT...

20:16.083 --> 20:19.041
WHAT YOU DID TO ME,
THAT IS PART OF IT.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.041
HOW CAN I WRITE ABOUT MY LIFE

20:21.083 --> 20:23.583
IF I DON'T WRITE
ABOUT THAT NIGHT?

20:23.625 --> 20:26.625
BUT THAT'S ME ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.792
(exhales)
I DO KNOW THAT.

20:28.834 --> 20:30.792
SO THEN THAT BOOK
IS OUR PAST, RIGHT?

20:30.834 --> 20:32.875
YOURS AND MINE.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.208
I NEED TO BE LOOKING FORWARD.

20:35.250 --> 20:38.750
AS LONG AS THAT BOOK
IS OUT THERE, I CAN'T HEAL.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.542
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:55.959 --> 20:58.041
CHARLOTTE KEPT A PICTURE
OF HER EX-HUSBAND

20:58.083 --> 21:00.834
WHO CHEATED ON HER,
AND I CONFRONTED HER ABOUT IT--

21:00.875 --> 21:03.291
OOH, THAT'S UNLIKE YOU.
(laughs)

21:03.333 --> 21:06.041
SHE WON'T TELL ME WHY SHE
KEPT IT, AND I'M WORRIED.

21:06.083 --> 21:09.208
SHE'S LIED TO ME BEFORE
ABOUT THIS GUY.

21:09.250 --> 21:12.500
AM I CRAZY
TO MAKE A THING OUTTA THIS?

21:12.542 --> 21:16.208
UH, SIT DOWN.

21:16.250 --> 21:19.000
UH...

21:20.333 --> 21:22.291
HAS SHE HAD ANY CONTACT
WITH HER EX-HUSBAND

21:22.333 --> 21:25.417
SINCE THE DIVORCE?
AS FAR AS I KNOW,

21:25.458 --> 21:27.709
THEY HAVE NOT TALKED SINCE
THE DAY SHE WALKED OUT ON HIM,

21:27.750 --> 21:29.709
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THEY MOVED HERE TOGETHER,

21:29.750 --> 21:31.750
AND... I LOOKED HIM UP.
HE'S STILL HERE.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.500
HE'S A MECHANIC
IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.542
WELL, SHE MIGHT
STILL CARE ABOUT HIM.

21:36.583 --> 21:40.667
YOU THINK SHE STILL
HAS FEELINGS FOR THIS GUY?
YES, YES, BUT NOT NECESSARILY
THE WAY YOU THINK.

21:40.709 --> 21:42.458
OKAY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.041
(sighs)

21:44.083 --> 21:46.041
CHARLOTTE MIGHT BE
HOLDING ON TO THAT PICTURE

21:46.083 --> 21:48.041
NOT BECAUSE SHE STILL CARES
ABOUT HER EX,

21:48.083 --> 21:51.000
BUT BECAUSE SHE STILL CARES
ABOUT WHY HE CHEATED ON HER.

21:51.041 --> 21:53.000
SHE LOVED THIS GUY,
AND HE DECEIVED HER.

21:53.041 --> 21:56.000
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH PEOPLE
TELL HER IT WASN'T HER FAULT,

21:56.041 --> 21:58.041
SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN,
CHARLOTTE PROBABLY WONDERS,

21:58.083 --> 22:00.041
IF ON SOME LEVEL
IT WAS HER FAULT,

22:00.083 --> 22:02.458
IF SHE DID SOMETHING
TO PUSH THE GUY AWAY OR...

22:02.500 --> 22:04.917
SO HOW DOES SHE
GET PAST IT?

22:04.959 --> 22:07.166
WELL, EITHER SHE CONFRONTS HIM
AND TRIES TO UNDERSTAND--

22:07.208 --> 22:10.166
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
OR SHE LIVES WITH IT.

22:10.208 --> 22:12.291
PEOPLE LIVE WITH ALL KINDS
OF FRUSTRATIONS, COOPER.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.709
YOU KNOW, BELIEVE ME.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.333
UH, IF THIS IS
A VIOLET/MARLA THING--

22:17.375 --> 22:20.041
VIOLET PLAYS IT DOWN,
ACTS LIKE IT'S NOTHING.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.583
BUT IT'S NOT NOTHING, COOPER.
IT'S SOMETHING TO ME.

22:22.625 --> 22:25.375
AND TO SPITEFULLY SUGGEST
THAT A WOMAN LIKE MARLA

22:25.417 --> 22:27.834
CAN BE SWAPPED OUT
FOR A FRIEND OF CHARLOTTE'S--

22:27.875 --> 22:32.208
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE--
WHEN I'M IN LOVE...

22:32.250 --> 22:34.959
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH MARLA?

22:35.000 --> 22:38.875
MAYBE, BUT THE POINT IS,
I'LL NEVER KNOW.

22:38.917 --> 22:41.041
THIS WHOLE "LIVING
WITH FRUSTRATION" THING,

22:41.083 --> 22:43.333
MAYBE IT'S NOT
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

22:43.375 --> 22:45.208
YEAH.

22:48.083 --> 22:51.041

UH, BILLY DOUGLAS?

22:58.083 --> 22:59.750

22:59.792 --> 23:03.041

HEY, UH, BILLY DOUGLAS?

23:10.083 --> 23:12.417
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

23:12.458 --> 23:15.041
UH, I'M COOPER FREEDMAN,
AND THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE,

23:15.083 --> 23:17.041
BUT I'M ENGAGED
TO CHARLOTTE KING.

23:17.083 --> 23:20.792
AND I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.834
(indistinct conversations)

23:25.750 --> 23:27.458
WHY DID YOU PUSH HER?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.041
I DIDN'T PUSH HER.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.250
YES, ADDISON, YOU DID.

23:31.291 --> 23:34.709
SHE WAS A WRECK. THE SECRET
WAS EATING AWAY AT HER.

23:34.750 --> 23:37.834
SHE WAS WILLING TO RISK HER LIFE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT WITH GARY.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.291
I THOUGHT
HE'D AT LEAST LISTEN.
WELL, HE DID LISTEN.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.250
YEAH, RIGHT BEFORE
HE WALKED OUT THE DOOR.
VAL LIED TO HIM.

23:43.291 --> 23:46.291
VAL MADE A CHOICE.
A UNILATERAL CHOICE. SHE DIDN'T
DISCUSS IT WITH HER HUSBAND.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.291
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIM
WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.291
SHE JUST--SHE JUST DID IT

23:50.333 --> 23:52.750
AND EXPECTED HIM TO SAY
IT WAS OKAY.

23:52.792 --> 23:55.750
BUT WHEN--WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE, ADDISON,

23:55.792 --> 23:57.875
WHEN YOU'RE
IN A REAL RELATIONSHIP,

23:57.917 --> 23:59.959
YOU DON'T DO THAT.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.250
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS REAL.

24:02.291 --> 24:05.041
SAM, I LOVE YOU.
THEN WHY DID YOU GIVE ME
AN ULTIMATUM?

24:05.083 --> 24:07.041
WE DISCUSSED IT.
WE DID NOT DISCUSS.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.834
YOU SAID, EITHER WE HAVE
A BABY OR WE END IT.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.333
THAT'S NOT A DISCUSSION.

24:12.375 --> 24:16.208
(Sanders Bohlke's

24:16.250 --> 24:19.041
I CAN'T DATE MARLA
IF VIOLET HATES HER.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.542
WHY NOT?

24:20.583 --> 24:22.542
IT'LL CREATE WORK STRESS
AND PERSONAL STRESS,

24:22.583 --> 24:24.542

WELL, UNHAPPY.

24:24.583 --> 24:27.375
VIOLET WILL BE UNHAPPY,

24:27.417 --> 24:30.542
YEAH, WELL--
YEAH, WELL, WHAT? HOW MUCH
DO YOU LIKE THIS WOMAN?

24:30.583 --> 24:33.542
WELL, GIVEN THE SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME I'VE SPENT WITH HER,

24:33.583 --> 24:36.083
IT'S A LOT.
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK

24:36.125 --> 24:38.542
VIOLET CARES ABOUT
MARLA'S REVIEW OF HER BOOK?

24:38.583 --> 24:41.709
HONESTLY? (chuckles) A LOT.
HOW MUCH SHOULD SHE CARE?

24:41.750 --> 24:43.709
NOT MUCH.
WELL, THEN TELL VIOLET.

30:27.583 --> 30:30.542
I KNOW THIS ISN'T GONNA
MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

30:30.583 --> 30:36.041
BUT I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH HER
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LOVE YOU.

30:36.083 --> 30:38.041
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:38.083 --> 30:40.083
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.542
LOOK...

30:42.583 --> 30:44.542
(exhales deeply)

30:44.583 --> 30:47.583
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED OUT HERE,

30:47.625 --> 30:50.583
I DIDN'T HAVE A VERY GOOD SENSE
OF WHO I WAS.

30:50.625 --> 30:53.375
BUT NOW I DO.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.125
GOOD FOR YOU.

30:55.166 --> 30:58.041
I'M GAY, CHARLOTTE.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.959
GET OUT.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.041
YOU'RE MAD THAT I'M GAY?

31:03.083 --> 31:05.959
I'M MAD THAT YOU'RE
A LIAR AND A CHEAT.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.959
TURN AROUND,
WALK YOUR ASS OUTTA MY OFFICE,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.417
AND DON'T YOU EVER
COME BACK.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.792
(door opens)

31:17.834 --> 31:19.041
(blinds clatter)

31:19.083 --> 31:20.875
(exhales deeply)

31:25.083 --> 31:28.041
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE
BROUGHT HIM HERE!
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.458
I DON'T NEED
THAT KIND OF HELP.
YEAH, YOU DO.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.041
HE HURT YOU, CHARLOTTE,
AND YOU NEVER KNEW WHY,

31:33.083 --> 31:35.625
AND THAT CREATED ANXIETY.
YOU FELT IT. I FELT IT.

31:35.667 --> 31:37.166
AND NOW YOU KNOW.

31:37.208 --> 31:40.041
YOU KNOW IT WAS NOTHING
YOU DID TO PUSH HIM AWAY.

31:40.083 --> 31:42.667
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU.
THIS IS GOOD, CHARLOTTE.

31:42.709 --> 31:45.041
THIS IS CLOSURE.

31:45.083 --> 31:48.125
I WISH IT WERE
THAT EASY, COOPER.

31:51.083 --> 31:54.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

31:54.083 --> 31:56.041
WE'RE DOING THE C-SECTION?

31:56.083 --> 31:59.000
YES.

31:59.041 --> 32:02.041
SO YOU CONVINCED VAL?

32:02.083 --> 32:03.792
I DIDN'T.

32:03.834 --> 32:06.458
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO TALK HIM INTO IT?

32:06.500 --> 32:09.041
I TOLD HIM THAT UNLESS
HE WANTED TO RISK LOSING HER,

32:09.083 --> 32:11.041
HE HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

32:11.083 --> 32:13.041
WHAT IF HE SAID NO?

32:13.083 --> 32:15.041
HE WASN'T GOING TO.

32:15.083 --> 32:17.250
HE LOVES HER.

32:17.291 --> 32:20.500
(indistinct conversations)

32:26.750 --> 32:28.875
DID YOU TAKE HER?

32:30.458 --> 32:33.041
I DO NOT WANT HER
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT WOMAN.
IT'S VIOLET'S DECISION.

32:33.083 --> 32:36.041
YOU PUT HER IN DANGER!
WE BOTH KNOW THAT SHE WAS
GONNA GO NO MATTER WHAT, OKAY?

32:36.083 --> 32:39.333
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.
AT LEAST I WAS WITH HER.

32:39.375 --> 32:43.083
WE'RE ON--
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE HERE.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.083
OKAY? THE LAST THING
VIOLET NEEDS RIGHT NOW

32:45.125 --> 32:47.291
IS THE TWO OF US FIGHTING.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.291
(sighs) THE TRUTH IS,
I'M ANGRIER AT HER THAN YOU.

32:50.333 --> 32:53.291
SHE DOES WHAT SHE WANTS
WHEN SHE WANTS.

32:53.333 --> 32:56.834
HEY,
THAT'S WHAT MAKES HER VIOLET.

32:58.959 --> 33:01.041
(elevator bell dings)

33:01.083 --> 33:02.083
HEY.

33:02.125 --> 33:04.041
WHAT HAPPENED WITH CANCER MOM
AND HER PREEMIE?

33:04.083 --> 33:06.041
UH, ADDISON DID THE C-SECTION.
MOM'S OKAY.

33:06.083 --> 33:07.750
AND BABY?

33:07.792 --> 33:09.291
UH, WE'LL SEE.

33:09.333 --> 33:12.291
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT IS
HAPPENING WITH YOU AND ADDISON,

33:12.333 --> 33:15.333
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AWKWARD
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.083
OH, YEAH, WELL, UH,

33:17.125 --> 33:20.291
I-I JUST GOT
A LOT ON MY MIND.

33:20.333 --> 33:23.083
MORE THAN JUST ADDISON?
AMELIA, PLEASE.

33:23.125 --> 33:26.291
SORRY. FORGET I ASKED.

33:26.333 --> 33:28.834
SHE GAVE THE ULTIMATUM,
YOU KNOW,

33:28.875 --> 33:30.291
NOT ME.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.166
I KNOW THAT.

33:33.208 --> 33:36.291
THE FACT THAT WE ARE WHATEVER
WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS ON HER.

33:36.333 --> 33:38.834
UNTIL YOU ANSWER.

33:38.875 --> 33:42.041
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT
LIKE THIS.

33:42.083 --> 33:44.041
MAYBE NOT,
BUT SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS.

33:44.083 --> 33:46.000
I MEAN, DO YOU?

33:46.041 --> 33:48.041
NOT YET.

33:48.083 --> 33:50.375
DO YOU THINK
MAYBE THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

33:53.083 --> 33:56.041
(clicking)

33:56.083 --> 33:59.041
(footsteps approach)

33:59.083 --> 34:01.625
(power tools whirring)

34:01.667 --> 34:03.542
MR. DOUGLAS.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.583
(sighs)
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD A TEMPER.

34:07.625 --> 34:10.250
YEAH, WELL...

34:10.291 --> 34:12.166
(sighs)

34:12.208 --> 34:15.041
IT WASN'T MY IDEA
TO COME SEE YA.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.041
BUT YOUR GUY COOPER...

34:17.083 --> 34:19.375
CAN BE VERY PERSISTENT.

34:19.417 --> 34:21.667
I KNOW THAT.

34:21.709 --> 34:24.709
(tool clicking)

34:24.750 --> 34:28.041
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
TELL ME YOU WERE GAY?

34:28.083 --> 34:31.041
(exhales deeply)

34:31.083 --> 34:34.000
I WAS CONFUSED.

34:34.041 --> 34:36.083
I THOUGHT THAT...

34:37.959 --> 34:41.792
I WONDERED IF THE PROBLEM
WAS YOU.

34:41.834 --> 34:44.041
THAT'S WHAT TIFFANY
WAS ABOUT,

34:44.083 --> 34:46.041
TRYING TO SEE
IF I FELT DIFFERENT

34:46.083 --> 34:48.250
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

34:48.291 --> 34:51.041
I DIDN'T.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.291
(tool clatters)

34:52.333 --> 34:54.333
YOU REALIZE,
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY.

34:54.375 --> 34:58.041
THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER
TOLD ME...

34:58.083 --> 35:01.041
YEAH.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.542
(exhales)

35:04.875 --> 35:07.333
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

35:07.375 --> 35:10.041
I-I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STUPID,

35:10.083 --> 35:12.542
BUT IT WAS NOTHING YOU DID.

35:12.583 --> 35:14.250
YOU...

35:14.291 --> 35:18.041
ARE AN AMAZING WOMAN.

35:18.083 --> 35:21.000
WAS I KIDDING MYSELF
TO THINK YOU'D FEEL RELIEVED?

35:22.500 --> 35:26.041
IT'S JUST, UH...

35:26.083 --> 35:29.709
BACK THEN...

35:29.750 --> 35:32.375
YOU WERE THE RIGHT CHOICE...

35:32.417 --> 35:34.375
THE PERFECT GUY.

35:34.417 --> 35:38.667
MY PARENTS LOVED YOU,
MY FRIENDS LOVED YOU...

35:38.709 --> 35:41.125
I LOVED YOU.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.709
AND NOW KNOWING...
THAT I FELL IN LOVE

35:45.750 --> 35:48.875
WITH A MAN
WHO COULD NEVER LOVE ME BACK...

35:48.917 --> 35:51.041
NOT THE WAY I NEEDED--

35:51.083 --> 35:53.166
I NEVER THOUGHT OF MYSELF

35:53.208 --> 35:55.792
AS A WOMAN
WHO MAKES BAD CHOICES.

35:58.083 --> 36:01.041
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

36:01.083 --> 36:02.834
YOU FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT?

36:02.875 --> 36:04.041
(chuckles)

36:04.083 --> 36:08.041
YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.
HELL, I DIDN'T KNOW.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.125
(sighs)

36:09.166 --> 36:11.125
BUT THIS TIME...

36:11.166 --> 36:14.000
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU GOT IT RIGHT?

36:19.792 --> 36:21.625
(jangles keys)

36:28.208 --> 36:30.750
I'M RISKING EVERYTHING
COMING HERE.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.417
OH!

36:32.458 --> 36:34.125
KATIE, WHAT ARE YOU...

36:38.083 --> 36:41.375
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T WRITE
THE BOOK TO HURT ME.

36:41.417 --> 36:44.458
YOU NEEDED TO HEAL, TOO,
AND--
KATIE, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE.

36:44.500 --> 36:48.250
OH, BUT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO COME TO MY WORK?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.542
WHAT I DID TO YOU...

36:52.583 --> 36:56.041
IT WAS WRONG, AND I KNOW
I CAN NEVER MAKE IT RIGHT.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.667
IT'S WITH ME ALL THE TIME.

36:58.709 --> 37:01.417
IT'S--IT'S LIKE...

37:01.458 --> 37:05.041
IT'S LIKE THIS WOUND
THAT NEVER HEALS,

37:05.083 --> 37:07.458
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.834
I RELIVE IT IN MY SLEEP.

37:09.875 --> 37:12.375
(voice breaks) I AGONIZE
OVER IT WHEN I'M AWAY.

37:12.417 --> 37:15.458
I FORGIVE YOU.
(normal voice)
THAT'S JUST IT.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.041
I CAN NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

37:19.083 --> 37:21.625
WELL, IT--IT'LL...

37:21.667 --> 37:24.500
IT'LL JUST TAKE SOME TIME.

37:24.542 --> 37:27.917
I'VE CAUSED YOU
SO MUCH PAIN.

37:27.959 --> 37:30.375
ALL MY PROBLEMS...

37:30.417 --> 37:34.417
IT WAS WRONG FOR ME
TO TAKE THEM OUT ON YOU.

37:34.458 --> 37:38.375
I'M SORRY.

37:38.417 --> 37:41.709
I'M--I'M REALLY SO SORRY.

37:44.083 --> 37:47.083
(sobs and sniffles)

37:47.125 --> 37:48.542

37:55.000 --> 37:59.041
(footsteps approach)

37:59.083 --> 38:00.709
HEY.

38:00.750 --> 38:04.125
I LET MY OWN INSECURITIES GET
IN THE WAY OF YOUR HAPPINESS,

38:04.166 --> 38:06.291
AND THAT WAS WRONG.
I MEAN, IT'S MY PROBLEM,

38:06.333 --> 38:10.500
AND I-I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN IT OUT ON YOU, SO I'M...

38:10.542 --> 38:12.041
SORRY.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.041
AND IF YOU LIKE MARLA,
YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT,

40:42.500 --> 40:44.458
NO, MY MOTHER KILLED HERSELF,
SAM.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.458
NO, SHE SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE
NEVER BEING WHO SHE REALLY WAS,

40:47.500 --> 40:49.250
NEVER SAYING OUT LOUD,

40:49.291 --> 40:52.041
"THIS IS WHO I AM,
AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT,"

40:52.083 --> 40:55.041
AND THEN WHEN SHE FINALLY DID
GET THE COURAGE UP TO GO FOR IT,

40:55.083 --> 40:57.041
IT WAS TOO LATE.

40:57.083 --> 40:59.041
SHE WAITED TOO LONG.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.583
SAM...

41:00.625 --> 41:03.750
I... HAVE ALREADY WAITED
TOO LONG.

41:03.792 --> 41:07.041
YOU KNOW, FIRST IT WAS "WAIT
UNTIL YOU MEET THE RIGHT GUY,"

41:07.083 --> 41:09.041
AND THEN I MET DEREK,
AND THEN I TOLD MYSELF,

41:09.083 --> 41:11.583
"ADDISON, BE SMART. WAIT UNTIL
YOU FINISH MED SCHOOL,"

41:11.625 --> 41:13.583
THEN "WAIT UNTIL YOU FINISH
YOUR RESIDENCY,"

41:13.625 --> 41:15.542
AND THEN "WAIT UNTIL YOU FINISH
YOUR FELLOWSHIP,"

41:15.583 --> 41:18.041
AND MY MARRIAGE EXPLODED,
AND THEN I HAD AN AFFAIR,

41:18.083 --> 41:20.041
AND THEN IT WAS,
"OH, NO, NOT NOW.

41:20.083 --> 41:23.250
YOU CAN'T HAVE MARK'S BABY.
THAT WOULD BE UNSEEMLY."

AND WAITED

41:25.750 --> 41:27.667
UNTIL I ONLY HAD
ONE EGG LEFT.

41:27.709 --> 41:30.333
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
THAT I DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

41:30.375 --> 41:32.333
IT'S BECAUSE I TOOK
HAVING KIDS FOR GRANTED,

41:32.375 --> 41:34.375
BECAUSE A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL
CAN DO IT,

41:34.417 --> 41:36.375
BECAUSE A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN
CAN DO IT.

41:36.417 --> 41:38.375
YOU KNOW WHO CAN'T DO IT?

41:38.417 --> 41:39.834
AN OVEREDUCATED, TALENTED,

41:39.875 --> 41:41.834
STRONG, POWERFUL WOMAN
IN HER 40s.

41:41.875 --> 41:44.834
HOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT?

41:44.875 --> 41:47.959
HOW MAD AM I AT MY BODY?

41:48.000 --> 41:51.417
I WAITED TOO LONG. OKAY?

41:51.458 --> 41:54.333
AND NOW IT'S TIME.

41:54.375 --> 41:56.333
I HAVE A CLOCK
INSIDE OF ME, SAM.

41:56.375 --> 41:59.333
IT'S NOT JUST TICKING.
THE ALARM IS GOING OFF.

41:59.375 --> 42:02.709
IT'S SCREAMING. IT'S TIME.
I CAN'T WAIT. NOT ANYMORE.
