WEBVTT

00:01.081 --> 00:02.441
<i>U-6 12...</i>

00:02.761 --> 00:04.601
...is a disgrace
for the German Navy.

00:05.121 --> 00:06.801
The captain is a disgrace.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.601
As the highest-ranking officer on board,

00:09.641 --> 00:11.721
I order you to leave U-612.

00:12.121 --> 00:13.041
I'll go with you.

00:33.121 --> 00:35.361
We're on collision course.
We have to change course.

00:35.561 --> 00:36.641
Maintain course.

00:37.001 --> 00:38.001
What?

00:38.641 --> 00:40.521
Don't you get what this is all about?

00:41.601 --> 00:42.601
Immortality.

00:43.921 --> 00:45.281
Close the outer doors!

01:00.841 --> 01:01.961
Eighty meters.

01:05.321 --> 01:06.961
Set new course, one-four-five.

01:17.761 --> 01:19.241
No more propeller noise.

01:19.641 --> 01:21.081
No more propeller noise.

01:25.401 --> 01:27.281
Have they stopped their engines?

01:32.881 --> 01:34.081
Fuck!

01:35.801 --> 01:39.361
Propeller noise! Propeller noise!
In one-six-zero.

01:39.761 --> 01:40.801
Shit!

01:41.321 --> 01:42.881
They called for reinforcements.

01:45.641 --> 01:47.281
We need to take her down.

01:47.681 --> 01:48.961
Take her down, First Watch Officer.

01:53.001 --> 01:54.361
Take her down. 150 meters.

01:54.521 --> 01:57.121
Full down on the bow planes.
Ten degrees down on the stern planes.

02:12.161 --> 02:14.001
Take her down! 200 meters!

02:14.321 --> 02:15.561
Full speed ahead!

02:21.361 --> 02:22.241
Shit!

02:22.441 --> 02:24.161
- Fire extinguisher!
- Fire extinguisher!

02:24.321 --> 02:25.321
Boat is falling.

02:25.441 --> 02:27.201
All hands astern!

02:27.361 --> 02:30.121
All hands astern! Go on, move it!
Faster!

02:30.161 --> 02:31.801
Come on, men! Go!

02:32.961 --> 02:34.441
Move it, move it! Go, go, go!

02:34.561 --> 02:36.041
All hands astern!

02:36.121 --> 02:37.281
Faster! Go!

02:37.361 --> 02:39.921
Move it! Go, go, go!

02:40.001 --> 02:41.001
Faster!

02:45.521 --> 02:47.761
Main bilge pump failed.
Trim by air.

02:51.561 --> 02:52.801
Boat is still falling.

02:53.201 --> 02:54.721
Both engines full speed astern.

02:58.681 --> 02:59.841
Blow all main ballast tanks.

02:59.961 --> 03:01.561
Blow all main ballast tanks!

03:04.441 --> 03:05.681
Vents are cycled.

03:05.921 --> 03:07.041
Come up.

03:08.881 --> 03:10.201
Come up!

03:18.561 --> 03:19.841
Boat can't be held.

03:21.241 --> 03:23.321
- Boat can't be held.
- Boat can't be held.

03:31.681 --> 03:33.361
220 meters.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.801
230 meters.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.761
250 meters.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.361
The boat has touched the seabed.

05:02.681 --> 05:03.881
Which seabed?

05:05.401 --> 05:06.961
There is no seabed here.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.521
The actual water depth here
is 4,000 meters.

05:12.761 --> 05:14.601
We're aground somewhere.

05:16.361 --> 05:17.961
Switch on emergency lights!

05:21.001 --> 05:22.241
We have been heard.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.681
God Almighty put his hand
underneath our keel.

05:39.801 --> 05:41.081
Check the pipes.

05:52.281 --> 05:53.241
Shit.

05:55.001 --> 05:55.921
Lutzi!

06:01.401 --> 06:03.041
Cook, a cloth, quick.

06:03.521 --> 06:06.081
A cloth. A cloth? Am I bleeding?

06:07.761 --> 06:09.081
You'll have a big scar.

06:09.201 --> 06:10.561
- A scar?
- Yes.

06:13.161 --> 06:15.121
Scars make good stories.

06:16.161 --> 06:19.001
Especially for the girls.
They'll want to know all the details.

06:21.561 --> 06:22.761
Flooding!

06:23.801 --> 06:26.201
- Flooding!
- Flooding!

06:26.521 --> 06:28.881
Damage reports! Now!

06:31.041 --> 06:34.201
Counter-leaking crew to their stations!

06:34.281 --> 06:35.441
Sir!

06:35.641 --> 06:38.241
Counter-leaking crew to their stations!

06:38.401 --> 06:39.441
Sir!

06:42.961 --> 06:44.721
Rupture in the water-cooling pipe.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.361
Give me the phase terminal.
Move it!

07:13.641 --> 07:15.521
What do you want, First Watch Officer?

07:16.961 --> 07:18.321
Orders?

07:23.001 --> 07:24.201
The journey is over.

08:54.081 --> 08:55.561
Simone.

08:55.641 --> 08:58.201
In consultation with Field Headquarters,
the Mayor...

08:58.641 --> 09:01.561
had to replace a few names
on the list of hostages.

09:03.601 --> 09:06.601
He had to explain the new names.
Please translate this for me.

09:06.721 --> 09:08.561
We don't want to execute anyone
who sympathizes with us.

09:08.841 --> 09:11.841
When you are finished, please give a copy
to Commander Gluck.

09:12.161 --> 09:13.201
Of course.

09:14.081 --> 09:16.281
I reserved a table at La Marée
for us tonight.

09:16.641 --> 09:17.801
I expect you at 7:00 p.m.

09:49.361 --> 09:52.201
<i>The French speaking to the French.</i>

09:53.121 --> 09:56.801
<i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>please listen to some personal messages.</i>

09:58.161 --> 10:01.961
<i>There is a fire at the insurance agency.</i>

10:03.321 --> 10:06.321
<i>Catherine is unwell.</i>

10:08.081 --> 10:11.281
<i>Athalie remained in ecstasy.</i>

10:11.961 --> 10:13.161
<i>I repeat:</i>

10:13.761 --> 10:16.961
<i>Athalie remained in ecstasy.</i>

10:30.321 --> 10:32.001
What about coastal patrols?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.041
Hey.

10:43.281 --> 10:45.001
We don't take orders from you, understood?

11:03.281 --> 11:04.681
You listen.

12:51.121 --> 12:52.521
She's the nurse.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.721
- How long has she been like this?
- It started in the night.

13:06.321 --> 13:08.201
In the beginning
I thought it was laryngitis,

13:08.281 --> 13:10.801
but normally she doesn't cry
and there's a tightness round her ribs.

13:10.921 --> 13:12.841
- You've had medical training?
- No,

13:13.121 --> 13:15.681
but I've been the nanny
of many children in this town.

13:16.681 --> 13:19.281
But there were none I cared for
as much as I care for this little angel.

13:19.881 --> 13:21.601
She needs Sulfapyridine.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.201
But we've run out.

13:23.841 --> 13:27.881
Keep her warm. Get her to drink.
I'll come back to check on her tomorrow.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.081
Thanks.

13:32.001 --> 13:34.241
Thank you so much for everything.

13:35.241 --> 13:36.241
It's my job.

13:36.361 --> 13:39.641
No, it isn't. You're doing much more
than just your job.

13:51.201 --> 13:52.361
Is everything all right?

13:53.841 --> 13:54.721
Yes.

13:57.361 --> 13:58.601
Take good care of yourself.

14:12.081 --> 14:13.321
She wants to see you.

15:52.321 --> 15:54.321
Tomorrow afternoon at Frank's flat.

16:11.241 --> 16:13.721
The baby. Anna.

16:14.681 --> 16:15.921
Her toes turned blue.

16:16.681 --> 16:18.681
Lack of oxygen because of the pneumonia.

16:19.881 --> 16:21.801
I'll try to get my hands
on some penicillin.

16:21.921 --> 16:23.601
I'll manage, somehow.

16:31.201 --> 16:32.441
What a twisted world.

16:33.441 --> 16:36.001
I never thought
I could be friends with a German.

16:57.241 --> 16:59.001
When I fell into the water...

16:59.961 --> 17:01.721
my balls were bleeding.

17:04.801 --> 17:07.041
Pieces of me got washed away.

17:09.721 --> 17:11.601
All I wanted was for it to end.

17:13.601 --> 17:15.521
I wanted to stop breathing.

17:17.401 --> 17:18.881
But I couldn't.

17:19.961 --> 17:21.281
I just couldn't.

17:24.401 --> 17:26.881
The fucking wolf inside of me
wouldn't let me.

17:31.321 --> 17:33.081
And I believed in you.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.961
Did you really think it would work out
between us?

17:47.761 --> 17:49.441
Flooding stopped in engine room.

17:53.601 --> 17:54.921
The Laura Ethel Bank.

17:55.201 --> 17:56.641
That's the only possibility.

17:57.121 --> 17:59.121
We're further north than I thought.

17:59.281 --> 18:02.601
A shoal, we ran aground on a foothill
of this shoal.

18:02.721 --> 18:03.801
Chief.

18:04.201 --> 18:05.561
Flooding stopped in the bow room.

18:05.681 --> 18:08.321
Irrigation valves' number one
and three's tubes are leaking slightly.

18:08.681 --> 18:11.561
Almost all of the rescue rebreathers
are useless because of the fire.

18:11.961 --> 18:13.121
It can't be.

18:13.521 --> 18:16.081
If this is right we're already
at 1,050 millibars.

18:16.281 --> 18:19.161
- We were at 980 when we submerged.
- Damn it!

18:21.561 --> 18:23.121
So, air is leaking into the boat?

18:24.521 --> 18:25.721
From the compressed air cylinders?

18:26.041 --> 18:27.201
Overpressure inside the boat.

18:28.001 --> 18:29.881
And not enough air to blow the tanks.

18:31.881 --> 18:32.801
Shit.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.361
What are we going to do now?

18:36.641 --> 18:39.201
You should have thought about this
beforehand, fuckers!

18:39.361 --> 18:41.081
We'll all be on your conscience!

18:41.241 --> 18:42.241
What do you want from me?

18:42.321 --> 18:44.881
- What?
- Stop it, both of you!

18:48.321 --> 18:49.521
That's not helping, at all!

18:51.801 --> 18:53.441
Air pressure constantly rising.

18:54.241 --> 18:56.041
We're already at 1,070 millibars.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.201
If it continues rising at this pace
we're done soon.

19:00.121 --> 19:01.281
CO2 level?

19:03.561 --> 19:05.241
From 5% on it's going to get critical.

19:06.441 --> 19:08.761
At 8% we risk falling unconscious.

19:09.881 --> 19:11.121
After that, we'll suffocate.

19:17.361 --> 19:19.161
How much time do we have, Chief?

19:19.881 --> 19:20.921
Twenty-four hours.

19:22.521 --> 19:24.121
Twenty-six tops.

19:29.721 --> 19:30.601
Shit.

19:39.001 --> 19:40.321
We need orders.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.881
Chief, you're in command.

19:47.521 --> 19:48.841
- Chief--
- Yes, I know!

19:57.361 --> 19:58.561
Every valve,

19:59.361 --> 20:01.881
every air pipe,
I want you to check everything

20:01.961 --> 20:04.001
until we've found and secured the leak.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.841
After that,
we'll take care of the batteries.

20:07.441 --> 20:10.081
We've got to get the e-compressor started.

20:11.281 --> 20:14.441
And then pray to God that we'll compress
enough air to blow the tanks.

20:32.801 --> 20:34.321
You think that's our punishment?

20:34.521 --> 20:35.401
For what?

20:35.921 --> 20:37.001
For everything.

20:37.161 --> 20:39.361
Hoffmann. Max.

20:40.881 --> 20:43.001
Maybe Max wasn't the Jonah on board.

20:43.641 --> 20:45.761
Maybe it's someone else.

20:50.081 --> 20:53.161
If the gauge climbs past 1,500 millibars
we can only estimate the pressure then.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.001
Maybe we won't have enough air to surface.

20:59.921 --> 21:01.681
Here. The air is leaking from here.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.001
Show me.

21:13.961 --> 21:14.841
Clamp.

21:20.281 --> 21:22.121
The girl in La Rochelle, you know...

21:24.001 --> 21:25.521
I didn't sleep with her.

21:25.721 --> 21:26.841
I know.

21:28.641 --> 21:30.881
You see it in the eyes if someone
has already fucked.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.681
All of the bad luck.

21:35.601 --> 21:37.561
A virgin on board is bad luck,
right?

21:38.561 --> 21:41.401
The way it's going here, we have at least
twenty of your lot on board.

21:42.561 --> 21:44.281
You don't matter anymore.

21:46.201 --> 21:47.321
Report.

21:48.001 --> 21:49.601
Air leak secured.

21:52.281 --> 21:53.561
Well done, killer.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.641
Come on. Keep on looking.

21:59.361 --> 22:03.121
The oysters at La Marée are by far
the best you can get around here.

22:03.521 --> 22:04.681
Onion or lemon?

22:04.881 --> 22:05.761
Lemon.

22:10.841 --> 22:11.801
Here you go.

22:12.961 --> 22:14.361
And then you slurp it.

22:19.161 --> 22:20.081
So?

22:22.441 --> 22:23.521
Slimy.

22:24.361 --> 22:26.281
They go best with a sip of Champagne.

22:26.761 --> 22:27.721
Cheers.

22:32.641 --> 22:34.401
They grow along the coast here?

22:34.801 --> 22:37.641
Yes. One of the many advantages of
being stationed in La Rochelle.

22:38.041 --> 22:42.681
But it wasn't only for the seafood that
I decided to buy a house here.

22:43.801 --> 22:47.121
And, they are fetched by boat?

22:48.601 --> 22:50.681
How many fishermen are there
in La Rochelle?

22:51.121 --> 22:54.121
They could transport other things too.

22:55.081 --> 22:57.241
Of course, we can't control the coast
at all times.

22:57.321 --> 22:58.721
Especially not the smaller boats.

22:58.881 --> 23:00.121
And you're not afraid?

23:01.081 --> 23:04.721
I've often wondered how vulnerable we are.

23:04.881 --> 23:05.881
Miss Simone.

23:06.161 --> 23:07.841
Don't worry about that.

23:08.241 --> 23:10.401
The navy and the army are working
closely together.

23:10.561 --> 23:12.361
Gluck is personally taking care of this.

23:13.241 --> 23:16.321
But... let's not talk about work.

23:22.161 --> 23:24.081
From Paris. From Lelong.

23:29.521 --> 23:30.961
You know Lelong?

23:32.801 --> 23:34.881
The jeweler who defied the Gestapo?

23:36.641 --> 23:40.841
When told he should relocate his business
to Berlin, he wrote to the Führer

23:41.281 --> 23:44.041
that he couldn't produce Parisian jewelry
without being in Paris.

23:44.961 --> 23:47.521
An acceptable act of French Resistance.

23:47.961 --> 23:50.001
You think you can buy me?

23:53.841 --> 23:56.081
- Simone.
- I can't accept it.

23:57.961 --> 23:59.761
You constantly try to impress me.

24:00.361 --> 24:02.681
As if you wouldn't be enough for me.
You, just you Hagen.

24:02.841 --> 24:04.761
Without your power and your money?

24:06.401 --> 24:07.801
Think about it.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.721
- I need to drop this off.
- Nobody is there, Miss Strasser.

24:24.321 --> 24:25.361
I know.

24:26.281 --> 24:29.721
Commander Gluck needs to have this
on his desk by tomorrow morning.

25:34.521 --> 25:35.601
Miss Strasser.

25:38.921 --> 25:39.841
The...

25:41.521 --> 25:44.281
list of hostages with the exchanged names
has finally been translated.

25:44.361 --> 25:45.321
I see.

25:45.681 --> 25:47.441
Criminal Inspector Forster asked me

25:47.521 --> 25:50.241
to immediately deliver
a copy to Commander Gluck.

25:52.041 --> 25:52.961
Heil Hitler.

25:54.561 --> 25:55.641
Heil Hitler.

26:15.361 --> 26:16.441
Still rising.

26:17.961 --> 26:19.361
We checked everything.

26:19.441 --> 26:21.761
Apparently not.
It has to come from somewhere.

26:22.721 --> 26:25.161
Check everything again.
Move it!

26:34.081 --> 26:35.441
Give me my watch back.

26:35.601 --> 26:36.721
Why would I?

26:38.161 --> 26:39.281
It was my father's.

26:41.001 --> 26:42.561
I never met him. He was killed in war.

26:42.681 --> 26:43.841
Then he was lucky.

26:45.321 --> 26:48.721
Imagine he'd come back from war
just to see your fucking ugly face.

26:54.161 --> 26:55.601
I found the leak!

26:55.761 --> 26:57.761
It's in the main pipe to
the high-pressure air distributor.

26:59.281 --> 27:00.521
- You found it?
- Yes.

27:00.881 --> 27:02.841
A rupture in the high-pressure air pipe.
I'm on it.

27:02.961 --> 27:05.361
When you're finished,
immediately check the batteries.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.321
If we're lucky, just a couple
of the connectors came loose.

27:18.561 --> 27:20.161
No further increase in pressure!

27:21.121 --> 27:22.441
Wait and see.

27:32.761 --> 27:34.001
No further increase in pressure!

27:38.241 --> 27:40.761
Let's hope that the batteries
haven't been damaged.

27:58.001 --> 27:59.841
The connectors are broken.

28:00.321 --> 28:01.601
We have to repair them.

28:20.321 --> 28:23.801
Gas! Gas! Gas! Chlorine gas!

28:24.241 --> 28:25.881
Get out of there! Get out of there!

28:25.961 --> 28:28.721
Out, out, out! Get out!

28:30.881 --> 28:31.881
Shit!

28:32.761 --> 28:34.121
Give me your hand.

28:43.881 --> 28:45.281
Something wrong with the batteries?

28:45.841 --> 28:46.961
<i>Open up!</i>

28:47.201 --> 28:49.601
<i>- Open up!</i>
- Talk.

28:49.921 --> 28:50.921
Shit.

28:55.881 --> 28:57.041
Get me some water!

28:59.761 --> 29:01.361
Get me some water, damn it!

29:07.161 --> 29:08.681
You've been quick now.

29:15.201 --> 29:18.321
We only have those two left.
The rest have melted in the fire.

29:24.201 --> 29:26.161
The Petty Officer Electrician was lucky,

29:26.801 --> 29:28.441
but he's banged-up pretty bad.

29:35.961 --> 29:37.761
The e-compressor doesn't work
without power.

29:40.681 --> 29:43.441
And without the e-compressor,
we can't compress air to blow the tanks.

29:52.841 --> 29:54.281
Who volunteers?

29:58.721 --> 30:00.521
I'll do it. I'll go.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.641
Forget it. You'd get stuck.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.241
I'll do it.

30:12.241 --> 30:14.681
No, you're the machinist.
If something happens to you down there...

30:14.961 --> 30:17.281
If something happens down there,
we're all fucked.

30:21.201 --> 30:23.201
- I'll go with you.
- No, Frank.

30:27.281 --> 30:29.201
You've got a girl waiting for you.

30:31.521 --> 30:32.441
I have nobody.

30:44.121 --> 30:45.001
Pips.

30:56.561 --> 30:57.601
Thanks.

31:07.881 --> 31:08.841
Good luck.

32:40.441 --> 32:41.881
It's taking too long.

32:43.921 --> 32:46.641
- They're running out of air.
- Pull yourself together, man!

33:15.241 --> 33:16.841
The cell exploded.

33:18.401 --> 33:21.641
Rescue rebreathers are useless,
because of the battery acid.

33:28.201 --> 33:29.521
We're done.

33:31.241 --> 33:32.841
We're fucked.

34:09.561 --> 34:10.761
Get down there.

34:18.521 --> 34:19.961
I owe you an apology.

34:20.201 --> 34:23.761
You're right. Giving you the necklace
was presumptuous and distasteful.

34:24.641 --> 34:29.241
And I'm sorry that I have used my position
to get closer to you in private.

34:30.161 --> 34:31.081
Yes.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.961
We should keep things separate.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.121
Private and professional life.

34:36.681 --> 34:38.521
Who was that man?

34:39.001 --> 34:40.121
Mister Anglade.

34:40.281 --> 34:42.601
- It's related to the bomb.
- How?

34:42.721 --> 34:43.921
I still have to find out.

34:44.081 --> 34:47.081
Do you think I could be of help?

34:48.121 --> 34:49.641
- During the interrogation?
- Yes.

34:50.041 --> 34:52.681
- It can get rough from time to time.
- I can cope.

34:53.161 --> 34:54.081
Good.

34:54.761 --> 34:58.241
And Hagen, the necklace was...

34:58.841 --> 35:01.201
it wasn't distasteful.
Maybe presumptuous, but...

35:01.681 --> 35:02.881
it's beautiful.

36:52.001 --> 36:55.721
Mister Anglade is the concierge at
the iron foundry in Angoulême.

36:56.161 --> 36:58.761
A time clock was stolen from your factory
two weeks ago.

36:59.441 --> 37:00.921
One like this...

37:01.561 --> 37:03.081
or what's left of it.

37:04.401 --> 37:05.761
Where was the clock?

37:06.561 --> 37:09.761
A time clock was stolen
from your factory two weeks ago.

37:10.681 --> 37:12.561
Where was the clock?

37:12.641 --> 37:14.601
- At the entrance.
- At the entrance.

37:16.441 --> 37:20.041
Did he work that day?
Was he in his porter's lodge?

37:21.241 --> 37:24.441
Were you working that day?
Were you in your porter's lodge?

37:24.641 --> 37:25.561
Yes.

37:28.361 --> 37:30.561
And where is this porter's lodge?

37:30.881 --> 37:32.241
Where's the porter's lodge?

37:33.081 --> 37:34.761
Opposite the time clock.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.441
Opposite the time clock, yes.

37:36.601 --> 37:37.681
Opposite.

37:43.401 --> 37:44.761
Are you a Communist, mister?

37:45.281 --> 37:46.681
Me? No.

37:49.921 --> 37:51.201
Ask him if he's blind.

37:52.641 --> 37:54.001
Are you blind?

37:55.121 --> 37:57.161
No... no...

37:57.961 --> 38:02.041
I'll send him and his whole family to
a concentration camp. On the next train.

38:03.561 --> 38:05.641
Or he can go home. It's up to him.

38:09.001 --> 38:15.321
You and your family are going to be sent
to a concentration camp on the next train,

38:15.881 --> 38:19.921
or you can leave as a free man.
It's up to you.

38:38.241 --> 38:40.761
A young guy needed the parts.

38:42.441 --> 38:44.001
He repairs clocks.

38:47.321 --> 38:51.081
It's a young guy who needed the parts,
because he repairs clocks.

38:56.681 --> 38:58.121
Name and address.

39:36.761 --> 39:37.721
What now?

39:44.761 --> 39:45.841
Ruchaud.

39:47.361 --> 39:48.441
Here we go.

39:49.001 --> 39:51.521
Communism comes from "communis" -
together.

39:51.561 --> 39:53.561
If there's one, there are more.

39:54.521 --> 39:57.521
He attended meetings of the communists
until 1940.

39:57.681 --> 40:00.681
His entire family is on the list
of hostages. Let's get him.

40:01.561 --> 40:05.281
If this boy built the bomb for Monroe,
my investigation will soon be over.

40:06.201 --> 40:07.801
Finally, more time for my private life.

40:36.201 --> 40:40.441
I must say, Monsieur Ruchaud,
your mother is an excellent host.

40:44.601 --> 40:47.601
Family and resistance don't go well
together. Did nobody tell you that?

40:52.441 --> 40:54.401
Leads to a premature birth.

40:55.001 --> 40:56.201
Caused by kicks.

41:28.721 --> 41:29.641
Claude?

41:29.761 --> 41:31.801
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Luc? We're fucked.

41:31.961 --> 41:33.881
He's at home.

41:33.961 --> 41:36.281
- Does he know where they've gone tonight?
- Why?

41:36.401 --> 41:40.681
The Germans... Forster... we have to take
everything. They can't find any evidence.

42:30.441 --> 42:31.681
Hide there.

43:37.681 --> 43:40.521
Go away! Go away! Go away!

46:19.761 --> 46:20.721
Ralf?

46:23.281 --> 46:24.401
A sip of water?

46:41.641 --> 46:43.601
The CO2 level is at 3.7%.

46:43.761 --> 46:45.561
The first men show symptoms of poisoning.

46:46.721 --> 46:48.081
It's only two contacts.

46:48.201 --> 46:50.601
We just have to connect the clamps
and bridge the damn cell.

46:54.281 --> 46:55.721
One of us has to go in there.

46:55.921 --> 46:56.881
He'll die.

46:59.801 --> 47:02.561
One of us has to do it,
or else we can't surface.

47:03.881 --> 47:05.561
Then we have to draw lots.

47:06.121 --> 47:07.361
Fuck that!

47:08.281 --> 47:09.561
Wolves.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.921
They'd prefer to eat each other...

47:13.961 --> 47:15.521
rather than suffocate.

47:17.401 --> 47:20.401
Everyone draws a lot.
Everyone.

47:21.641 --> 47:23.401
Except Strasser and Maas.

47:27.161 --> 47:29.801
We're all responsible for this mess.

47:36.521 --> 47:37.841
I've got two children.

47:39.721 --> 47:42.161
That's my order,
as the highest-ranking officer.

47:42.561 --> 47:44.561
Have I made myself clear?

52:22.121 --> 52:23.201
Power.

52:24.161 --> 52:25.281
Power.

52:25.361 --> 52:27.281
- We've got power again.
- Power.

52:30.121 --> 52:31.961
Man rudder and hydroplanes.

52:42.321 --> 52:43.641
Switch on the red light.

53:03.601 --> 53:04.881
Air pressure is falling.

53:14.841 --> 53:16.121
Blow all main ballast tanks.

53:39.681 --> 53:42.361
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

54:09.841 --> 54:11.681
- We're rising.
- We're rising.

54:13.721 --> 54:15.001
We're rising.

54:21.121 --> 54:22.721
240 meters.

54:30.841 --> 54:32.281
230 meters.

54:38.921 --> 54:40.641
220 meters.

54:46.161 --> 54:47.881
210 meters.

54:52.161 --> 54:53.801
200 meters.

55:12.361 --> 55:13.521
Eighty meters.

55:15.241 --> 55:16.961
First Sea Watch, stand by.

55:23.641 --> 55:24.881
Seventy meters.

55:31.761 --> 55:33.201
Sixty meters.

55:36.081 --> 55:37.161
Fifty.

55:43.801 --> 55:44.841
Forty.

55:51.601 --> 55:52.841
Thirty meters.

55:58.441 --> 56:00.121
990 millibars.

56:00.521 --> 56:02.201
Pressure balance restored.

56:06.601 --> 56:07.921
Twenty meters.

56:11.041 --> 56:12.401
Ten meters.

56:22.521 --> 56:24.121
Open conning tower hatch.

56:35.521 --> 56:38.521
Yeah!

56:39.121 --> 56:44.881
Yeah!

57:59.841 --> 58:00.921
Simone?

58:10.121 --> 58:11.161
Hagen.

58:13.521 --> 58:14.961
What are you doing here?

58:16.721 --> 58:17.841
Simone.
