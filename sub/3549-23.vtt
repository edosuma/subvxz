WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:03.234
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

00:03.234 --> 00:05.606
ONE PROPOSAL LED TO ANOTHER.

00:05.606 --> 00:08.109
(gasps)
 WE'RE WITH IMMIGRATION.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.282
BUT THE LAW GET IN THE WAY.
 CAN'T THIS WAIT?
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET MARRIED.

00:11.282 --> 00:15.015
NOT TODAY, YOU'RE NOT.
 A BREAK-IN WAS STAGED...

00:15.015 --> 00:17.148
ORSON, WE'VE BEEN ROBBED.

00:17.148 --> 00:21.192
IN AN ATTEMPT TO HIDE ASSETS
IN A DIVORCE.

00:21.192 --> 00:24.325
AFTER THE CRASH...
 AND THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT CAME OUT.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.398
MIKE TOLD 'EM THAT HE WAS
DRIVING, BUT IT WASN'T TRUE.

00:33.564 --> 00:36.067
(Mary Alice) THE THING
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

00:36.067 --> 00:40.471
ABOUT DAVE WILLIAMS
IS HE WANTED TO BE FORGIVEN.

00:40.471 --> 00:44.345
THAT'S WHY HE MADE
THE VIDEOTAPE.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.182
I DIDN'T WANT TO KILL
M.J. DELFINO.

00:51.182 --> 00:53.384
I HAD TO.

00:56.187 --> 00:59.260
(sighs)

00:59.260 --> 01:04.394
SUSAN MAYER KILLED
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

01:04.394 --> 01:07.298
THE POLICE CALLED IT...
AN ACCIDENT.

01:07.298 --> 01:11.572
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE A PERSON

01:11.572 --> 01:14.245
WHO TAKES TWO PRECIOUS LIVES

01:14.245 --> 01:16.847
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO JUST...

01:16.847 --> 01:18.379
WALK AWAY.

01:18.379 --> 01:22.153
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL WONDER,

01:22.153 --> 01:24.455
WHY DIDN'T I JUST KILL SUSAN?

01:24.455 --> 01:28.088
BUT WHAT GOOD
WOULD THAT HAVE DONE?

01:28.088 --> 01:30.861
SHE'D BE DEAD.
THERE'D BE NO...

01:30.861 --> 01:32.593
SUFFERING.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.095
(voice breaks)
AND TO THOSE WHO HATE ME

01:35.095 --> 01:37.798
BECAUSE I TOOK THE LIFE...

01:37.798 --> 01:39.700
OF AN INNOCENT YOUNG BOY,
I SAY...

01:39.700 --> 01:41.872
(doorbell rings)

01:41.872 --> 01:43.874
AW, CRAP.

01:43.874 --> 01:45.536
(beep)

01:49.840 --> 01:55.616
YES, DAVE WILLIAMS WANTED
EVERYONE TO FORGIVE HIM...

01:55.616 --> 01:59.420
LOOK, I GOT A NEW TACKLE BOX
FOR OUR TRIP ON SATURDAY.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.653
BUT NOT UNTIL
HE FINISHED DOING...

02:02.653 --> 02:14.235
THE UNFORGIVABLE.

02:21.912 --> 02:23.914
AFTER
THE WHITE HORSE NIGHTCLUB

02:23.914 --> 02:27.218
WAS DESTROYED
BY A SUSPICIOUS FIRE,

02:27.218 --> 02:30.821
ONE BODY WAS LEFT UNCLAIMED.

02:30.821 --> 02:33.924
THE DETECTIVES ON THIS CASE
REFERRED TO HIM AS...

02:33.924 --> 02:37.928
"JOHN DOE A-37."

02:37.928 --> 02:42.393
FOR MONTHS,
THEY TRIED TO IDENTIFY HIM.

02:42.393 --> 02:47.198
THEN ONE DAY, THEY GOT A CALL
FROM AN IMPOUND LOT.

02:47.198 --> 02:50.241
IT SEEMS A CAR HAD BEEN TOWED
FROM THE CLUB PARKING LOT

02:50.241 --> 02:52.243
THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE--

02:52.243 --> 02:54.805
A SEDAN
THAT HAD BEEN RENTED...

02:54.805 --> 02:58.479
TO A DR. SAMUEL HELLER
FROM BOSTON,

02:58.479 --> 03:03.554
WHO HAD BEEN REPORTED MISSING
FOUR MONTHS EARLIER.

03:03.554 --> 03:09.260
THE DOCTOR'S DENTAL RECORDS
CONFIRMED THEIR THEORY.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.662
HIS RECEPTIONIST, HOWEVER,

03:11.662 --> 03:12.963
DID NOT.

03:12.963 --> 03:15.296
NO WAY.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.798
DR. HELLER DID NOT DIE
IN THAT FIRE.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.800
MA'AM, WE'VE GOT
HIS DENTAL RECORDS.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.803
I DON'T CARE. YOU SAID
THE FIRE WAS FOUR MONTHS AGO?

03:22.803 --> 03:25.606
WELL, I'VE GOTTEN TEXTS
FROM HIM SINCE THEN.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.878
YOU HAVE?

03:27.878 --> 03:30.981
YEAH. THE LAST ONE WAS
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.

03:30.981 --> 03:32.943
HMM.

03:32.943 --> 03:36.247
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SEND A TEXT BACK.

03:36.247 --> 03:38.249
MA'AM, YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE
WITH YOU?

03:46.927 --> 03:49.500
(vibrates)

03:49.500 --> 03:50.961
HEY, DAVE.

03:50.961 --> 03:52.963
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.666
YOU WERE?
 YEAH. UM... DID YOU
SAY SOMETHING TO M.J.

03:55.666 --> 03:58.639
ABOUT GOING
ON THAT FISHING TRIP?
 YEAH, I DID.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.672
I KNOW HOW DEPRESSED YOU'VE BEEN
SINCE JACKSON WAS DEPORTED,

04:01.672 --> 04:04.615
SO I THOUGHT,
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME

04:04.615 --> 04:07.448
FOR THE THREE OF US TO GO
UP TO THE LAKE. AND...

04:07.448 --> 04:10.281
(paper bag crinkles)
 I GOT M.J. HIS OWN
LITTLE LIFE VEST.

04:10.281 --> 04:15.686
I WISH I COULD, BUT I CAN'T.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT JACKSON.
 ALL THE MORE REASON.

04:15.686 --> 04:17.688
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT FISHING--

04:17.688 --> 04:19.790
IT'S NATURE'S TRANQUILIZER.
(laughs)
 (chuckles)

04:21.562 --> 04:24.535
DAVE, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM
JACKSON SINCE HE WAS TAKEN AWAY,

04:24.535 --> 04:26.537
AND I JUST WANNA BE HERE
IN CASE HE CALLS.

04:26.537 --> 04:29.400
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S OKAY.
JUST BRING YOUR CELL PHONE.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.272
I'D JUST FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
IF I'M CLOSE BY.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.274
OH, THAT'S CRAZY.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.377
I MEAN, JACKSON WOULDN'T
WANT YOU SITTIN' AROUND HERE

04:36.377 --> 04:38.379
WORRYING ABOUT HIM.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.682
I'M SORRY.
WE'LL GO FISHING ANOTHER TIME.

04:43.854 --> 04:46.557
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE SELFISH HERE?

04:46.557 --> 04:48.489
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT M.J.?

04:48.489 --> 04:51.362
YOU WANNA GO FISHING,
DON'T YOU, BUDDY?
 YEAH!

04:51.362 --> 04:52.523
YEAH.

04:52.523 --> 04:55.065
(chuckles)
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:55.065 --> 04:57.628
I JUST TOLD YOU I CAN'T GO.

04:57.628 --> 05:00.070
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT M.J.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.973
HE'LL BE FINE.

05:06.737 --> 05:09.540
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.311
I'M SORRY.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.983
IT'S JUST A TRIP.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.925
(exhales deeply)

05:24.925 --> 05:26.957
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!
 (scoffs)

05:26.957 --> 05:28.959
SIX MONTHS IN EUROPE
WOULD BE EDUCATIONAL.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.961
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
MORE EDUCATIONAL?

05:30.961 --> 05:32.963
YOU GOING TO COLLEGE
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

05:32.963 --> 05:34.965
MOM, I'VE ALREADY BEEN IN SCHOOL
FOR 12 YEARS ALREADY.

05:34.965 --> 05:38.969
I... I NEED A VACATION.
 WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE, BASED ON
YOUR LAST FEW REPORT CARDS,

05:38.969 --> 05:40.971
YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN
 ON VACATION.

05:40.971 --> 05:44.415
I'M GONNA BE 18. IF I WANNA
GO TO EUROPE, I'LL GO TO EUROPE.

05:44.415 --> 05:47.578
OH? WELL, GOOD LUCK
PAYING FOR IT,

05:47.578 --> 05:50.481
BECAUSE IF YOU SO MUCH
AS APPLY FOR A PASSPORT,

05:50.481 --> 05:54.385
WE'RE CUTTIN' YOU OFF.
 CUT OFF FROM THE MIGHTY
SCAVO FAMILY FORTUNE? OH, NO!

05:54.385 --> 05:57.958
(scoffs) TOM, WHY DIDN'T YOU
HELP ME OUT THERE?

05:57.958 --> 06:00.931
BECAUSE I AGREE WITH HIM.

06:00.931 --> 06:02.062
WHAT?

06:02.062 --> 06:04.064
WELL, HE'S YOUNG.
HE SHOULD BE HAVING FUN.

06:04.064 --> 06:07.067
I MEAN, LOOK--LOOK AT ME.
I'M A MIDDLE-AGED MAN

06:07.067 --> 06:10.040
READING THE WANT ADS
FOR JOBS THAT I'LL NEVER GET.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.043
I SHOULD'VE GONE TO EUROPE
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.
 HEY, FOCUS.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.045
OUR SON IS
THROWING HIS LIFE AWAY.

06:15.045 --> 06:17.748
WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP HIM
ON TRACK.
 (hits newspaper)

06:17.748 --> 06:20.110
WHAT IS SO GREAT
ABOUT THE TRACK?

06:20.110 --> 06:22.813
I WAS ON IT. I DID EVERYTHING
I WAS SUPPOSED TO.

06:22.813 --> 06:24.955
IT CHEWED ME UP
AND SPIT ME OUT.

06:24.955 --> 06:26.957
I KNOW YOU'RE DISCOURAGED,

06:26.957 --> 06:29.990
BUT... LETTING OUR SON
MAKE A HUGE MISTAKE

06:29.990 --> 06:33.824
IS NOT GONNA HELP ANYTHING.
 EVEN IF IT IS A HUGE MISTAKE,

06:33.824 --> 06:37.167
YOU GOT TO LET PEOPLE MAKE SOME
DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN LIFE.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.730
YOUR WAY
IS NOT THE ONLY WAY.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.732
I AM JUST
TRYING TO HELP PRESTON

06:41.732 --> 06:44.004
AVOID THE WAY MARKED
"UNEMPLOYABLE LOSER."

06:44.004 --> 06:46.977
(sighs) FINE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

06:49.510 --> 06:52.513
I WANT YOU TO GET THIS STUPID
EUROPE IDEA OUT OF HIS HEAD.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.515
TAKE HIM ON A TOUR
OF THE CAMPUS.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.017
GET HIM EXCITED.
SHOW HIM COLLEGE COULD BE FUN.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.589
SURE.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.123
AND ON THE WAY HOME,
I'LL SHOW MY COLLEGE DIPLOMA

07:03.123 --> 07:05.425
TO THE GUY
AT THE BURGER BARN.
 OHH.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.428
YEAH. THEY'RE HIRING A NEW
FRY COOK FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.102
IF YOU'RE REALLY
STOPPING BY THERE,

07:12.102 --> 07:14.605
BRING HOME SOME ONION RINGS.

07:14.605 --> 07:16.607
MOMMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:16.607 --> 07:19.610
WE'RE GOING TO A FAMILY REUNION
AT AUNT CONNIE'S ON SATURDAY,

07:19.610 --> 07:21.512
AND I WANT TO LOOK MY BEST.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.914
IS IT GONNA BE FUN?

07:23.914 --> 07:26.076
WELL, IF YOUR IDEA
OF A GOOD TIME

07:26.076 --> 07:28.579
IS SITTING ON RUSTY LAWN CHAIRS
IN THE DRIVEWAY

07:28.579 --> 07:30.581
EATING LARD
IN THE SHAPE OF CHICKEN,

07:30.581 --> 07:33.724
THEN YEAH!
IT'S GONNA BE A BLAST.
 THE DRIVEWAY?

07:33.724 --> 07:35.025
HONEY, YOU'RE 6 NOW,

07:35.025 --> 07:39.560
SO I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD
A LITTLE MOTHER/DAUGHTER TALK.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.562
YOUR FATHER'S SIDE
OF THE FAMILY'S TRASH.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.093
ANY QUESTIONS?

07:43.093 --> 07:45.095
IF YOU DON'T LIKE HER,

07:45.095 --> 07:48.098
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING ON
YOUR BEST JEWELRY?

07:48.098 --> 07:50.100
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT GROWNUPS DO,
SWEETIE.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.573
WHEN WE DON'T LIKE SOMEONE,
WE DON'T PUNCH THEM

07:52.573 --> 07:55.045
OR SAY MEAN THINGS.
WE JUST FIND SUBTLE WAYS

07:55.045 --> 07:57.477
TO MAKE THEM FEEL BAD
ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.950
OOH, LIKE THESE EARRINGS.
AUNT CONNIE CAN'T AFFORD THEM,

07:59.950 --> 08:02.112
AND THAT'LL MAKE HER SAD.

08:02.112 --> 08:04.615
AND THIS WILL BRING HER
TO HER KNEES.

08:04.615 --> 08:07.017
AND THIS WILL BE
A KICK IN HER THROAT.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.523
IF YOU HATE 'EM SO MUCH,
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GO.

08:12.523 --> 08:15.065
OH, NO, SWEETIE. WE HAVE TO GO.
THEY'RE FAMILY.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.200
SEE, THIS IS WHY I WANTED
TO CHECK ON MY THINGS.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.203
YOU DON'T LEAVE A VALUABLE
PAINTING ON THE DAMN FLOOR.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.876
YOU NEED TO PUT SOMETHING
UNDERNEATH IT.

08:25.876 --> 08:28.208
FINE. HOW ABOUT
THIS UGLY DOORMAT?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.210
THAT IS NOT A DOORMAT.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.511
THAT IS A HANDWOVEN
KURDISH KAZAK RUG.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.985
(thud)

08:34.985 --> 08:37.688
YOU KNOW, BREE,
WHEN I HANG OUT WITH YOU,

08:37.688 --> 08:39.690
I REALIZE HOW LITTLE I KNOW

08:39.690 --> 08:41.892
AND HOW MUCH
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP.

08:41.892 --> 08:44.193
(air echoing and whooshing)
 (gasps) GIVE ME THAT.

08:44.193 --> 08:46.196
I'M SO GLAD THIS DIVORCE
IS ALMOST OVER.

08:46.196 --> 08:49.900
AN OBNOXIOUS, UNPLEASANT MAN
WILL BE OUT OF MY LIFE,

08:49.900 --> 08:51.832
AND SO WILL ORSON.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.834
HEY, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.836
YOU STILL GOT
A COUPLE OF HURDLES.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.769
HAS ORSON BROUGHT UP
THE INSURANCE CLAIM AGAIN?

08:58.769 --> 09:00.270
NO, HE THINKS I FILED IT.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.773
GREAT. WHEN HE REALIZES YOU
NEVER DID, YOU'LL BE DIVORCED,

09:02.773 --> 09:04.775
HE'LL BE BROKE,
AND IT WON'T MATTER.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.777
YES,
AND I'LL BE SINGLE AGAIN,

09:06.777 --> 09:08.779
AND I CAN CONCENTRATE
ON MY BUSINESS,

09:08.779 --> 09:10.851
MAYBE DO SOME TRAVELING.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.583
MAYBE SPEND A LITTLE TIME

09:12.583 --> 09:14.685
AT THE INTERSECTION
OF RIGHT LEG AND LEFT LEG,

09:14.685 --> 09:17.958
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
 SADLY, KARL, I ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.891
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT,
I COULD SET YOU UP.

09:20.891 --> 09:24.294
I KNOW A LOT OF GREAT GUYS WHO
ARE GOOD FOR A FREE DINNER.

09:24.294 --> 09:27.297
(bells jingle)
 AND A FEW LAUGHS, HUH?

09:27.297 --> 09:29.299
THANKS, KARL.
I'M NOT EVEN DIVORCED YET,

09:29.299 --> 09:32.302
AND ONCE I AM, I DON'T THINK
YOU'D BE MY FIRST CHOICE

09:32.302 --> 09:34.144
AS A MATCHMAKER.
 OH, SHOOT.

09:34.144 --> 09:35.646
(bells jingle)

09:39.009 --> 09:40.310
(tires peal)

09:45.155 --> 09:47.658
(sighs)

09:47.658 --> 09:49.760
(cell phone rings)

09:51.722 --> 09:53.023
(ring)

09:53.023 --> 09:54.765
(beep)
 HELLO?

09:54.765 --> 09:56.066
HEY, SUSAN, IT'S ME.

09:56.066 --> 09:59.069
Jackson,
I have been so worried.

09:59.069 --> 10:01.301
WHERE--WHERE ARE YOU?
 Fairview Jail.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.234
THEY'RE PROCESSING
MY DEPORTATION PAPERS.

10:04.234 --> 10:08.208
SO THEY'RE SENDING YOU BACK?
WHEN?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.080
COUPLE DAYS.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.382
I just wanted to call
and say thank you and...

10:12.382 --> 10:15.015
TELL YOU THAT I'LL MISS YOU.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.789
WELL... I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.

10:18.789 --> 10:20.791
I MEAN,
YOU CAME IN MY LIFE

10:20.791 --> 10:23.794
WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH
A REALLY HARD TIME,

10:23.794 --> 10:25.095
AND YOU WERE AMAZING.

10:25.095 --> 10:27.858
I mean, you are amazing.

10:27.858 --> 10:29.760
YOU, TOO.
 So...

10:29.760 --> 10:31.762
DID THE IMMIGRATION PEOPLE
TELL YOU

10:31.762 --> 10:34.304
HOW THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU?
 Anonymous tip.

10:34.304 --> 10:37.968
ALTHOUGH IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
WHO "ANONYMOUS" IS.

10:37.968 --> 10:41.071
(chuckles) DOES MIKE REALLY
THINK I'M THAT STUPID?

10:41.071 --> 10:44.414
MIKE?
YOU THINK MIKE DID THIS?

10:44.414 --> 10:46.176
Who else?

10:46.176 --> 10:48.679
MIKE AND KATHERINE WERE
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO KNEW.

10:48.679 --> 10:51.151
KATHERINE WAS DOING CARTWHEELS
ABOUT US GETTING MARRIED, SO...

10:51.151 --> 10:53.183
YEAH, BUT, NO,
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

10:53.183 --> 10:55.125
BECAUSE MIKE KNEW
THAT IT WASN'T FOR REAL.

10:55.125 --> 10:58.128
WELL, REAL OR NOT,
HE HAD THE LOOK OF A GUY

10:58.128 --> 11:00.831
WHO'S NOT READY
TO GIVE YOU UP, SO--

11:00.831 --> 11:02.192
TIME'S UP.

11:02.192 --> 11:04.264
UH, I-I GOTTA GO.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.938
I'LL TRY AND CALL YOU AGAIN
BEFORE I LEAVE.

11:07.938 --> 11:10.400
(beep)

11:10.400 --> 11:12.142
(sighs)

11:12.142 --> 11:13.143
(keys jangle)

11:21.852 --> 11:23.083
(chuckles)

11:31.892 --> 11:33.123
(door opens)

11:33.123 --> 11:35.065
(Tom) HEY!
 (door closes)

11:35.065 --> 11:37.427
HEY, HEY,
HOW WAS THE CAMPUS TOUR?

11:37.427 --> 11:38.799
FANTASTIC.
 OH!

11:38.799 --> 11:42.202
OH, MY GOD.
THAT SCHOOL IS AMAZING.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.204
OH.
 THE PROFESSORS ARE SO ENGAGED,

11:44.204 --> 11:46.206
AND THE KIDS WERE OPEN
AND FRIENDLY.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.707
REALLY?

11:47.707 --> 11:51.241
YEAH. IT WAS INSPIRING.
YOU WERE SO RIGHT TO SEND US.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.744
GOOD. GOOD.
I KNEW IF YOU SAW THE CAMPUS,

11:53.744 --> 11:56.346
YOU'D HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART.

11:56.346 --> 11:58.348
ME? NAH.
I'M STILL GOING TO EUROPE.

12:01.451 --> 12:05.425
WHAT WAS THAT? I THOUGHT
YOU SAID THE TOUR WAS FANTASTIC.

12:05.425 --> 12:09.830
OKAY, SO PRESTON STILL NEEDS
A LITTLE CONVINCING.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.403
BUT I DON'T.

12:13.403 --> 12:16.236
I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.408
WH-WHAT'S THAT NOW?

12:18.408 --> 12:21.071
OKAY. I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE
OUT OF LEFT FIELD,

12:21.071 --> 12:24.775
BUT WALKING ACROSS THE QUAD,
I FELT SO ALIVE.

12:24.775 --> 12:26.777
I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE
IN ADMISSIONS,

12:26.777 --> 12:29.820
AND ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS PASS AN ENTRANCE EXAM.

12:29.820 --> 12:33.884
SO...

12:33.884 --> 12:37.487
AHEM. YOU WOULD BE
A COLLEGE STUDENT... AGAIN.

12:37.487 --> 12:39.790
MM-HMM.

12:39.790 --> 12:43.063
(chuckles nervously)
25 YEARS AFTER THE FIRST TIME.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.996
BUT THIS TIME--FOCUSED.

12:45.996 --> 12:49.299
THIS TIME, KNOWING EXACTLY
WHAT I WANNA MAJOR IN.

12:49.299 --> 12:51.171
WHICH IS?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.243
CHINESE.

12:55.245 --> 12:56.776
CHINESE?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.809
(all) CHINESE?

12:58.809 --> 13:00.881
AS IN "MOO GOO GAI PAN"
CHINESE?

13:00.881 --> 13:02.883
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO
WITH THAT,

13:02.883 --> 13:05.115
WATCH BRUCE LEE MOVIES
WITHOUT THE SUBTITLES?

13:05.115 --> 13:07.117
(scoffs)
WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.

13:07.117 --> 13:10.120
I FELT FAINT, AND HE LEFT
TO GO BUY A BACKPACK.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.422
OOH. LYNETTE, THAT'S BAD.

13:12.422 --> 13:16.126
WELL, IT'S JUST SO RANDOM,
AND THE WORST PART IS

13:16.126 --> 13:18.428
IF I POINT THAT OUT,
I'M A BITCH.

13:18.428 --> 13:20.130
WHY IS THAT?

13:20.130 --> 13:22.132
WHEN DID BEING PRACTICAL
AND REALISTIC

13:22.132 --> 13:23.433
BECOME SYNONYMOUS
WITH BITCHINESS?

13:23.433 --> 13:26.136
THE FIRST TIME
A MAN DID SOMETHING STUPID,

13:26.136 --> 13:28.508
AND A WOMAN POINTED IT OUT.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.511
I KNOW TOM. HE'S GOING TO LEARN
HOW TO COUNT TO TEN IN CHINESE,

13:31.511 --> 13:34.214
THEN HE'LL GET BORED
AND MOVE ON TO HIS NEW DREAM

13:34.214 --> 13:38.088
OF BECOMING A BEEKEEPER.
 WELL, THEN YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.
BITE THE BULLET AND BITCH.

13:38.088 --> 13:40.090
NO, SHE HAS A CHOICE.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.352
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT

13:42.352 --> 13:45.055
WITHOUT BEING PERCEIVED OF
AS A NAGGING SHREW.

13:45.055 --> 13:48.128
PLEASE, SENSEI, INSTRUCT ME
IN YOUR ANCIENT WAYS.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.231
WELL, THE KEY IS TO NOT LET THEM
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

13:51.231 --> 13:55.265
THIS REQUIRES OBSERVATION,
CUNNING AND MANIPULATION.

13:55.265 --> 13:57.567
ISN'T IT JUST EASIER
TO SHUT DOWN YOUR HOO-HA

13:57.567 --> 14:00.110
UNTIL HE GIVES IN?
 I THINK THAT BREE IS RIGHT--

14:00.110 --> 14:02.242
THAT THE MORE TOM SEES YOU
DIGGING IN YOUR HEELS,

14:02.242 --> 14:05.115
THE MORE HE'S GONNA
WANNA DO IT.

14:05.115 --> 14:07.117
SO YOU WAIT
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY

14:07.117 --> 14:09.119
THAT YOU CAN USE
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE

14:09.119 --> 14:11.451
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
APPEARING SUPPORTIVE.
 THAT'S YOUR ADVICE?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.623
HOPE AN OPPORTUNITY
JUST DROPS IN MY LAP?

14:13.623 --> 14:16.957
MIGHT AS WELL START SHOPPING
FOR BEEKEEPER SUITS.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.059
(car door shuts in distance)

14:21.361 --> 14:26.166
OH, YOU GUYS, I'M SORRY.
I GOTTA RUN.

14:27.898 --> 14:30.300
HEY.
I NEED TO TALK TO MIKE.

14:30.300 --> 14:34.204
OH, HE'S IN THE SHOWER, BUT I'LL
TELL HIM YOU STOPPED BY.
 OH, NO NEED. I'LL WAIT.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.885
ORSON, I'M HOME.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.557
(lamp switch clicks)

14:59.599 --> 15:04.904
(bells jingling)

15:04.904 --> 15:06.336
HAVE A SEAT.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.382
(bells jingle)

15:14.614 --> 15:19.149
SO THERE NEVER WAS
A ROBBERY.

15:19.149 --> 15:23.623
YOU TOOK THESE THINGS,
HOPING TO HIDE THEM FROM ME.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.257
AND THOUGH I'VE TRIED TO COME UP
WITH A REASON, I CAN'T.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.559
SO I'M FORCED TO ASK
THE QUESTION WHY.

15:29.559 --> 15:32.232
WHY WOULD YOU DO
SUCH A THING?

15:35.265 --> 15:37.267
I WANT A DIVORCE.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.543
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.116
MY LAWYER SAYS YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO HALF OF EVERYTHING

15:46.116 --> 15:48.118
WE'VE ACQUIRED
DURING THE MARRIAGE,

15:48.118 --> 15:50.350
SO I WAS TRYING TO HIDE
SOME OF THOSE THINGS,

15:50.350 --> 15:53.683
SINCE--LET'S FACE IT--
I PAID FOR THEM.

15:53.683 --> 15:55.725
YOU'VE ALREADY HIRED
A LAWYER?

15:55.725 --> 15:57.587
YES, BUT I'M TIRED
OF ALL THE LYING

15:57.587 --> 16:00.290
AND THE SNEAKING AROUND,
SO I WILL INFORM HIM

16:00.290 --> 16:03.633
THAT YOU CAN HAVE
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.
 I DON'T WANT A DIVORCE.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.666
WELL, THAT PART'S
NON-NEGOTIABLE.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.698
CAN'T WE AT LEAST
TALK ABOUT THIS?

16:08.698 --> 16:12.042
THERE'S NO POINT.

16:12.042 --> 16:15.005
SO YOU SHOULD GET A PIECE
OF PAPER, START TO MAKE A LIST

16:15.005 --> 16:20.180
OF WHAT IT IS YOU WISH
TO TAKE WITH YOU.

16:20.180 --> 16:25.285
SO... YOU DON'T WANT
ANY OF IT?

16:25.285 --> 16:30.460
NO. ALL I WANT IS OUT.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.436
YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT BE A WHILE.
SURE I CAN'T HELP YOU?

16:46.436 --> 16:50.210
NO, I NEED
TO TALK TO MIKE.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.713
NOW YOU COULD FLUSH THE TOILET
AND TRY TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.784
(chuckles)

16:56.486 --> 16:59.089
YOU SEEM UPSET.

16:59.089 --> 17:00.720
SOMETHING HAPPENED?

17:03.223 --> 17:06.455
DID MIKE TURN JACKSON IN
TO IMMIGRATION?

17:06.455 --> 17:09.329
NO. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

17:09.329 --> 17:10.630
I DON'T KNOW. JEALOUSY?

17:10.630 --> 17:13.203
JACKSON THINKS MIKE
IS STILL HUNG UP ON ME.

17:14.503 --> 17:18.037
TRUST ME, SUSAN.
MIKE DID NOT TURN JACKSON IN.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.509
MM. SHOWER'S OFF.

17:19.509 --> 17:22.071
I GUESS WE'LL KNOW
IN A FEW SECONDS.

17:22.071 --> 17:25.275
LISTEN... MIKE COULDN'T HAVE
CALLED IMMIGRATION

17:25.275 --> 17:27.277
BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD HIM

17:27.277 --> 17:29.719
THAT JACKSON WAS MARRYING YOU
FOR A GREEN CARD.

17:29.719 --> 17:32.222
WELL, SOMEBODY DID,
BECAUSE HE SENT ME A TEXT

17:32.222 --> 17:35.425
AGREEING TO KEEP PAYING ME
ALIMONY.

17:35.425 --> 17:38.258
THAT WAS ME.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.560
I SENT IT.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.793
ARE YOU INSANE?
WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING--

17:43.793 --> 17:46.766
(normal voice) MIKE HAS
ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.598
WHAT?

17:48.598 --> 17:51.301
(voice breaks) AND I WAS AFRAID
THAT IF HE FOUND OUT

17:51.301 --> 17:53.303
THAT YOU WEREN'T REALLY
IN LOVE WITH JACKSON,

17:53.303 --> 17:55.605
THAT HE MIGHT
CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT ME.

17:55.605 --> 17:57.607
OKAY, KATHERINE,
THAT IS...

17:57.607 --> 18:00.450
(scoffs)
IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR TO MIKE.

18:00.450 --> 18:03.213
I MEAN, HE NEEDS TO KNOW
THE TRUTH.

18:03.213 --> 18:05.385
I CAN MAKE HIM HAPPY,
SUSAN.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.617
HE JUST NEEDS
TO GET OVER YOU.

18:07.617 --> 18:10.220
(Mike) KATHERINE?

18:10.220 --> 18:12.322
(whispers)
PLEASE, DON'T RUIN THIS.

18:12.322 --> 18:15.365
(descending footsteps)

18:15.365 --> 18:18.168
HEY, YOU WANNA JUST ORDER IN?

18:18.168 --> 18:20.270
OH, HEY, SUSAN.

18:20.270 --> 18:22.802
UM...
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.305
UM, I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANNA TELL YOU.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.877
UM, YEAH. I...

18:27.877 --> 18:30.380
KATHERINE ALREADY TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR BIG NEWS.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.142
(chuckles)

18:33.543 --> 18:36.146
OH.

18:36.146 --> 18:38.188
OKAY. UM...

18:38.188 --> 18:41.551
WELL, I HOPE WE HAVE
YOUR BLESSING. (chuckles)

18:41.551 --> 18:43.753
(chuckles nervously)

18:45.495 --> 18:48.228
YES, SURE.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.260
UH...

18:50.260 --> 18:52.362
(sighs) WHY NOT?

18:57.607 --> 19:01.711
I'M SORRY, SUSAN.

19:04.314 --> 19:07.747
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
MYSELF.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.726
WELL, DON'T BE MAD
AT KATHERINE.

19:16.726 --> 19:20.730
WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE JUST
CAN'T... KEEP A SECRET.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.878
WOW, THIS PLACE IS LOOKING
WORSE THAN EVER.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.551
YEAH, AUNT CONNIE'S SALONS
HAVEN'T BEEN DOING SO WELL.

19:41.551 --> 19:44.254
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE OFF SOME OF THOSE DIAMONDS.

19:44.254 --> 19:46.256
YOU WALK IN THERE LIKE THAT,

19:46.256 --> 19:49.259
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE HER
FEEL BAD ABOUT HERSELF.
 SAY NO MORE.

19:49.259 --> 19:51.561
YOU KNOW, AUNT CONNIE'S LIKE
A SECOND MOTHER TO ME.

19:51.561 --> 19:54.524
WHY DO YOU HATE HER SO MUCH?
 BECAUSE ALL SHE EVER DOES
IS PUT ME DOWN.

19:54.524 --> 19:57.196
IF YOU'D PAY ATTENTION, YOU'D
SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.499
OH! THERE'S MY CARLOS!

19:59.499 --> 20:01.501
(chuckles) HI, TíA.
 HI!

20:01.501 --> 20:02.902
MMM.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.774
(gasps)
ARE THESE THE GIRLS?

20:04.774 --> 20:07.377
NO! THEY'RE SO GROWN UP!

20:07.377 --> 20:09.239
(Carlos chuckles)
 (gasps)

20:09.239 --> 20:10.680
AND, GABY...

20:10.680 --> 20:12.612
(chuckles)

20:12.612 --> 20:14.314
IS IT JUST ME,

20:14.314 --> 20:18.288
OR DO YOU GET MORE BEAUTIFUL
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU?

20:18.288 --> 20:20.450
NO, IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

20:20.450 --> 20:23.453
COME HERE. GIVE ME A HUG.
 LET ME SEE YOUR PALMS.

20:23.453 --> 20:26.456
GABY.
 FINE. (chuckles)

20:26.456 --> 20:28.398
OH!
 OH! (groans) OH!

20:28.398 --> 20:30.260
(Carlos chuckles)
 (laughs)

20:30.260 --> 20:32.462
NOW COME ON IN!

20:32.462 --> 20:34.464
THE WHOLE FAMILY'S HERE.

20:34.464 --> 20:38.338
AND I'VE MADE SOME
OF MY WORLD-FAMOUS TAMALES.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.714
AUNT CONNIE SEEMS NICE.

20:44.714 --> 20:46.346
MAYBE SHE'S CHANGED.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.449
TRASH DON'T CHANGE, SWEETHEART.
SHE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.951
NOW COME ON,
LET'S GO GRAB A LAWN CHAIR

20:51.951 --> 20:55.485
BEFORE WE GET STUCK
ON THE GRASS WITH THE FIRE ANTS.

20:55.485 --> 20:58.888
(sighs)

20:58.888 --> 21:01.461
(beep)
 (man) Tom Scavo,
this is Mr. Cummings.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.463
We met during
your tour of the campus.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.964
Forgive me,

21:04.964 --> 21:07.967
but I gave you the wrong date
for the admissions test.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.970
It's tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.
So get a good night's sleep,

21:10.970 --> 21:14.344
and we'll see you
first thing in the morning.
 (beep)

21:14.344 --> 21:16.646
HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP!
 OH! COMING. I'M COMING.

21:16.646 --> 21:18.308
IT GOES... THERE.

21:18.308 --> 21:23.453
SO... I WAS THINKING THIS WHOLE
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL THING...

21:26.386 --> 21:28.287
DESERVES
A LITTLE CELEBRATION.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.591
REALLY? I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE ON BOARD.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.364
I WANNA BE SUPPORTIVE.

21:34.364 --> 21:36.366
LET'S GO FOR A NICE DINNER,

21:36.366 --> 21:38.368
GET A BOTTLE OF WINE...

21:38.368 --> 21:41.571
MAYBE TWO, SINCE WE DON'T HAVE
TO WAKE UP EARLY TOMORROW.

21:41.571 --> 21:44.073
OR WE CAN GO
TO THAT MEXICAN PLACE

21:44.073 --> 21:46.075
THAT HAS
THOSE GREAT MARGARITAS.

21:46.075 --> 21:49.739
OH, TOM. YOU AND TEQUILA?

21:49.739 --> 21:52.512
WHAT A GREAT IDEA.

21:52.512 --> 21:56.586
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
I NEED YOU TO GATHER AROUND.

21:56.586 --> 21:59.989
AUNT CONNIE
HAS SOMETHING TO SAY.

21:59.989 --> 22:02.051
GABY, COME ON.
MY TíA'S WAITING.

22:02.051 --> 22:04.053
WELL, LET HER WAIT.
I NEED SOMETHING TO DRINK.

22:04.053 --> 22:07.827
I MEAN TRYING TO KEEP DOWN ONE
OF HER "WORLD-FAMOUS" TAMALES.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.360
(Connie) THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
FOR COMING TODAY.

22:10.360 --> 22:14.003
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER.

22:14.003 --> 22:16.636
WE LOVE YOU, AUNT CONNIE.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.338
OH, AND I LOVE ALL OF YOU.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.441
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.774
AND NOW I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

22:24.774 --> 22:26.776
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

22:26.776 --> 22:29.779
I'VE BATTLED A WEAK HEART
FOR MOST OF MY LIFE.

22:29.779 --> 22:31.751
AND THE DOCTOR NOW TELLS ME

22:31.751 --> 22:35.354
THAT I MAY ONLY HAVE
A FEW MONTHS LEFT.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.085
(can fizzes)

22:39.529 --> 22:41.491
SORRY.

22:41.491 --> 22:43.963
BAD HEART.
FLOOR'S ALL YOURS.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.965
(Connie) AS SOME OF YOU KNOW,

22:45.965 --> 22:47.997
I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE
OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

22:47.997 --> 22:49.969
MY BEAUTIFUL ANA.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.742
BECAUSE OF MY CONDITION,
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE,

22:52.742 --> 22:55.445
AND I NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE HER IN.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.452
I REALIZE THAT THIS IS
A LOT TO ASK.

23:02.452 --> 23:06.486
WE WOULD LOVE TO HELP OUT,
BUT MIGUEL JUST LOST HIS JOB.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.558
WE'RE BARELY SCRAPING BY.

23:08.558 --> 23:10.119
I UNDERSTAND.

23:10.119 --> 23:14.123
OBVIOUSLY, IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE
WHO CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS.

23:15.865 --> 23:18.868
WE WISH WE COULD,
BUT WE'VE GOT SUCH A FULL HOUSE.

23:18.868 --> 23:22.071
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T HAVE KIDS.

23:24.474 --> 23:27.577
I KNOW THIS IS NOT GONNA
BE EASY, BUT WE'RE FAMILY,

23:27.577 --> 23:29.779
AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO
FOR EACH OTHER.

23:29.779 --> 23:32.011
(mouths word)
 (mouths word)

23:32.011 --> 23:34.584
WELL, YOU KNOW...

23:34.584 --> 23:38.147
WE'RE STILL GONNA
BE FAMILY TOMORROW,

23:38.147 --> 23:41.090
SO I THINK WE SHOULD
THINK ABOUT IT OVERNIGHT

23:41.090 --> 23:42.792
AND SEARCH OUR HEARTS,

23:42.792 --> 23:44.824
AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT

23:44.824 --> 23:47.126
WHICH ONE OF YOUR HOMES
IS BEST FOR ANA.

23:49.699 --> 23:51.761
GABRIELLE'S RIGHT.

23:51.761 --> 23:55.164
AND PLEASE KNOW THAT I WON'T
JUDGE ANY OF YOU HARSHLY

23:55.164 --> 23:58.768
IF YOU DECIDE
THAT YOU CANNOT TAKE CARE

23:58.768 --> 24:01.511
OF MY BEAUTIFUL GRANDDAUGHTER.

24:01.511 --> 24:03.943
WE LOVE YOU, AUNT CONNIE!

24:03.943 --> 24:06.215
YAY!

24:12.682 --> 24:15.485
(hums softly)

24:24.163 --> 24:25.995
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:25.995 --> 24:27.697
I'M HELPING.

24:27.697 --> 24:29.699
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

24:29.699 --> 24:32.872
AND BESIDES, MY PARISIAN SALAD
DOESN'T CALL FOR ANY CHIVES.

24:32.872 --> 24:36.606
YES. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS A BIT BLAND.

24:36.606 --> 24:41.110
(scraping)
 I THINK THE CHIVES WILL GIVE IT
THE BITE IT'S SO SORELY LACKING.

24:41.110 --> 24:44.153
MY SALAD HAS PLENTY OF BITE.

24:48.518 --> 24:51.721
SO... WHEN ARE YOU
MOVING OUT?

24:51.721 --> 24:53.523
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT.

24:53.523 --> 24:55.494
EXCUSE ME?

24:55.494 --> 24:58.167
OH, I'VE DECIDED TO STAY
SO WE CAN WORK ON OUR MARRIAGE.

24:58.167 --> 25:00.229
AM I CUTTING THESE TOO FINE?

25:00.229 --> 25:02.231
ORSON, I UNDERSTAND
THIS IS A SHOCK,

25:02.231 --> 25:06.075
BUT YOU HAVE TO FACE FACTS.
OUR MARRIAGE IS OVER.

25:06.075 --> 25:08.077
AH, ONCE YOU WEIGH
WHAT'S AT STAKE,

25:08.077 --> 25:10.079
I THINK YOU'LL CHANGE
YOUR MIND.

25:10.079 --> 25:12.712
WELL, IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO THE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT,

25:12.712 --> 25:15.214
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.246
NO, ACTUALLY,
I'M REFERRING TO YOUR FREEDOM.

25:17.246 --> 25:19.248
I'VE BEEN TO JAIL, BREE.

25:19.248 --> 25:21.250
TRUST ME, YOU WOULDN'T LAST
TEN SECONDS.

25:21.250 --> 25:24.053
JAIL?
 YES, OF COURSE.

25:24.053 --> 25:28.257
WELL, INSURANCE FRAUD
IS A SERIOUS CRIME.
 AH, BUT I NEVER FILED
AN INSURANCE CLAIM.

25:28.257 --> 25:30.029
AH, BUT I DID.

25:32.702 --> 25:35.605
WHAT?!
 YES, I THOUGHT WE WERE ROBBED.

25:35.605 --> 25:37.106
SO, OF COURSE,

25:37.106 --> 25:39.569
I DID THE RESPONSIBLE THING
AND REPORTED IT...

25:39.569 --> 25:42.141
ON BOTH OUR BEHALVES.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.143
AND SINCE YOU
RATHER CARELESSLY

25:44.143 --> 25:46.245
RENTED THE STORAGE UNIT
UNDER YOUR OWN NAME,

25:46.245 --> 25:49.178
I THINK THE POLICE WILL FIND ME
COMPLETELY BLAMELESS.

25:49.178 --> 25:51.280
YOU WOULD ACTUALLY
SEND YOUR WIFE TO PRISON?

25:51.280 --> 25:53.152
MY WIFE? NO.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.124
MY EX-WIFE? YOU BET.

25:55.124 --> 25:57.186
BUT IT WON'T COME TO THAT,
DARLING.

25:57.186 --> 26:00.259
I KNOW WE CAN GET BACK
TO WHAT WE BOTH ONCE HAD.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.263
THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.295
AND SURE WE'VE HAD
OUR CHALLENGES--

26:06.295 --> 26:09.238
YOUR PENCHANT FOR EMASCULATION,
MY KLEPTOMANIA.

26:09.238 --> 26:11.941
BUT EVERY MARRIAGE
HAS ITS EBB AND FLOW.

26:11.941 --> 26:14.874
ORSON, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.245
(continues chopping)

26:16.245 --> 26:18.347
(whispers) I DON'T LOVE YOU.

26:22.251 --> 26:24.283
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DARLING.

26:26.015 --> 26:28.257
I HAVE ENOUGH LOVE
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.891
(crunch)

26:31.891 --> 26:35.224
MMM! NOT BLAND ANYMORE.

26:44.233 --> 26:46.135
(exhales deeply)

26:46.135 --> 26:48.978
THE GIRLS ARE SACKED OUT.
CAN WE TALK NOW?

26:48.978 --> 26:50.980
WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

26:50.980 --> 26:53.983
YOU WON'T EVEN LET THE GIRLS
GET A GOLDEN RETRIEVER,

26:53.983 --> 26:56.946
AND NOW YOU WANNA
TAKE IN A TEENAGER?
 IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

26:56.946 --> 26:58.948
IT'S ABOUT
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

26:58.948 --> 27:02.021
THIS IS WHAT FAMILY DOES
FOR EACH OTHER.
 WELL, LUCKILY,
IT'S A BIG FAMILY.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.894
LET HER GO LIVE
WITH NINA AND LUIS.
 THEY HAVE EIGHT KIDS.

27:04.894 --> 27:06.355
SO WHAT'S ONE MORE?

27:06.355 --> 27:09.058
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.
 YOU'RE BEING SELFISH.

27:09.058 --> 27:12.231
NO, I'M THINKING ABOUT
 OUR CHILDREN. THEY'RE SO HAPPY.

27:12.231 --> 27:15.935
TAKING IN A KID WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW? THAT'S A HUGE RISK.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.937
YEAH, IT'S THE SAME RISK

27:17.937 --> 27:20.339
MY AUNT CONNIE TOOK
FOR ME AND MY MOTHER.

27:20.339 --> 27:24.073
WHEN MY FATHER LEFT, MAMá AND I
HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN.

27:24.073 --> 27:26.075
AUNT CONNIE
OPENED HER HOME TO US.

27:26.075 --> 27:29.078
SHE SAVED US FROM THE STREETS.
 YEAH, AND KNOWING AUNT CONNIE,

27:29.078 --> 27:32.081
SHE'S WAITED ALL THESE YEARS
TO CALL THAT FAVOR IN.

27:32.081 --> 27:34.183
SHE'S PROBABLY DYING
ON PURPOSE.

27:34.183 --> 27:37.987
BABE, WE ARE SO BLESSED.

27:37.987 --> 27:39.989
THIS IS A CHANCE
FOR US TO GIVE BACK.

27:39.989 --> 27:43.763
MAYBE GOD GAVE ME BACK MY SIGHT
AND ALL THIS MONEY

27:43.763 --> 27:46.195
SO I COULD HELP MY FAMILY.

27:46.195 --> 27:48.197
GABY, THINK ABOUT IT.

27:48.197 --> 27:50.169
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO US,

27:50.169 --> 27:53.242
WOULDN'T YOU WANT SOMEONE
TO DO THIS FOR OUR TWO GIRLS?

27:57.106 --> 27:59.278
(Tom laughs and shrieks)

27:59.278 --> 28:01.981
OKAY, WHOA, WHOA, EASY.
YOU'RE A LITTLE DRUNK THERE.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.983
THAT'S 'CAUSE I LOVE YOU,
LYNETTE!

28:03.983 --> 28:06.085
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.
HERE YOU GO.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.087
AND I LOVE YOU, PRESTON.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.219
I'M PORTER.

28:10.219 --> 28:11.921
I COULD NEVER TELL
YOU TWO APART.

28:11.921 --> 28:15.895
BUT YOU'RE MY FAVORITE.
(laughs)

28:15.895 --> 28:17.296
LYNETTE!

28:17.296 --> 28:19.999
HOW COME YOU LET ME DRINK
SO MANY MARGARITAS?

28:19.999 --> 28:24.333
YEAH, AND WHY DID WE HAVE
TO STAY TILL CLOSING?

28:24.333 --> 28:26.335
IT'S ALMOST 2:00.
 WHO CARES WHAT TIME IT IS?

28:26.335 --> 28:29.108
WE WERE CELEBRATING A BIG CHANGE
IN YOUR DAD'S LIFE.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.339
WHOO-HOO!

28:30.339 --> 28:33.182
HOO! HEY, SOMEONE CALLED.
 (beep)

28:33.182 --> 28:35.384
(man) Tom Scavo,
this is Mr. Cummings.

28:35.384 --> 28:37.747
We met during
your tour of the campus.

28:37.747 --> 28:39.248
Forgive me,

28:39.248 --> 28:41.250
but I gave you the wrong date
for the admissions test.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.252
It's tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

28:43.252 --> 28:44.954
(beep)

28:44.954 --> 28:47.426
OH, CRAM!
I GOTTA CRAP FOR THAT TEST!

28:47.426 --> 28:51.801
OOH, JEEZ.

28:59.268 --> 29:03.242
(vibrating)

29:03.242 --> 29:04.343
(beep)

29:15.354 --> 29:17.186
THEY'RE ON TO YOU.

29:17.186 --> 29:19.228
(sighs)

29:19.228 --> 29:21.530
THOSE MESSAGES YOU SENT
TO MY RECEPTIONIST

29:21.530 --> 29:23.332
DIDN'T FOOL ANYBODY.

29:25.294 --> 29:27.296
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED MY BODY,

29:27.296 --> 29:30.299
AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING
TO TRAP YOU.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.442
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

29:33.442 --> 29:36.075
THEY CAN TRACE
THOSE SIGNALS, DAVE.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.178
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND YOU.

29:42.351 --> 29:43.312
(grunts)

29:43.312 --> 29:44.353
(clatter)

29:44.353 --> 29:47.016
IT'S TOO LATE.

29:47.016 --> 29:49.018
WHATEVER PLAN YOU HAD,

29:49.018 --> 29:51.961
IT WENT TO HELL
WHEN YOU KILLED ME.

29:51.961 --> 29:54.423
YOU SHOULD'VE
STAYED ON YOUR MEDS.

29:54.423 --> 29:56.425
Y-YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

29:56.425 --> 29:59.098
I'M GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.
 WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?

29:59.098 --> 30:01.400
I DON'T MEAN TO CRITICIZE,

30:01.400 --> 30:04.333
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DOING THIS FOR US.

30:09.438 --> 30:11.380
I AM.

30:11.380 --> 30:14.413
I WANT JUSTICE
FOR OUR FAMILY.

30:14.413 --> 30:17.186
THEN WHO CARES
IF YOU'RE CAUGHT?

30:17.186 --> 30:19.448
WE MISS YOU, DAVE.

30:19.448 --> 30:22.291
WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

30:22.291 --> 30:24.293
SO...

30:24.293 --> 30:27.256
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

30:27.256 --> 30:31.360
SO I SHOULD JUST... (pants)
WALK OVER AND KILL M.J. NOW?

30:31.360 --> 30:34.563
SURE. WHY NOT?

30:34.563 --> 30:37.566
AND LET'S FACE IT, YOUR PLAN
TO TAKE THE KID TO SOME LAKE

30:37.566 --> 30:40.839
AND PRETEND
HE ACCIDENTALLY DROWNED?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.272
(singsongy) BORING.

30:43.272 --> 30:46.415
(normal voice) HEY,
ISN'T IT BETTER THAN SUSAN KNOW

30:46.415 --> 30:48.347
WHY HER SON HAD TO DIE?

30:48.347 --> 30:51.350
I MEAN, THE WHOLE POINT
IS TO MAKE HER SUFFER.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.521
RIGHT?

30:55.084 --> 30:56.425
THAT'S TRUE.

30:56.425 --> 31:00.960
AND THEN THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL FINALLY UNDERSTAND

31:00.960 --> 31:03.162
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
GOING THROUGH.

31:19.979 --> 31:23.212
YEAH, THAT'S IT!
GOOD JOB.

31:23.212 --> 31:25.354
ONE MORE JUST LIKE THAT.

31:25.354 --> 31:28.557
OOH. (chuckles) HEY.
UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU A SEC?

31:28.557 --> 31:30.259
YEAH. SURE.

31:32.461 --> 31:34.964
I'M GONNA GET SOME JUICE.
YOU WANT ANYTHING?

31:34.964 --> 31:36.225
UM, NO, THANKS.

31:36.225 --> 31:38.127
SO, LOOK, UH...

31:38.127 --> 31:40.369
I'M SORRY IF I WAS

31:40.369 --> 31:43.302
A LITTLE UNDER-ENTHUSIASTIC
THE OTHER DAY

31:43.302 --> 31:45.304
ABOUT YOU AND KATHERINE
GETTING MARRIED.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.176
OH, WELL, I UNDERSTAND.

31:47.176 --> 31:49.338
YOU JUST FOUND OUT
YOUR FIANCé WAS BEING DEPORTED.

31:49.338 --> 31:51.981
THE TIMING KIND OF SUCKED.

31:51.981 --> 31:54.313
YEAH. THAT AND, UH...

31:54.313 --> 31:57.316
I DON'T KNOW. IT D-DID KIND OF
COME OUT OF NOWHERE.

31:57.316 --> 32:00.619
WELL, WE HAVE BEEN
LIVING TOGETHER.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.292
I KNOW.

32:03.292 --> 32:05.995
BUT STILL... I MEAN,
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

32:05.995 --> 32:07.656
I JUST...

32:07.656 --> 32:11.160
(sighs) I WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

32:13.062 --> 32:14.233
SUSAN...

32:14.233 --> 32:17.536
I KNOW. AND FEEL FREE
TO THROW ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE

32:17.536 --> 32:19.708
IF I'M OUT OF LINE...

32:19.708 --> 32:23.372
BUT DO YOU LOVE HER?
 (pouring)

32:23.372 --> 32:24.473
(stops pouring)

32:28.417 --> 32:30.419
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

32:30.419 --> 32:34.323
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

32:34.323 --> 32:37.386
YEAH.

32:37.386 --> 32:39.058
I LOVE HER.

32:41.490 --> 32:44.093
GOOD.

32:44.093 --> 32:46.435
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR.

32:46.435 --> 32:48.537
(sighs)

32:48.537 --> 32:53.342
WELL, I HOPE THAT YOU WILL
BE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER.

32:55.404 --> 32:59.408
AND I HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT
FOR YOU AND JACKSON.

32:59.408 --> 33:02.411
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

33:02.411 --> 33:05.454
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU TWO AREN'T GETTING MARRIED?

33:05.454 --> 33:08.987
OH, THE TRUTH IS, UM...

33:10.389 --> 33:13.422
WELL, IT'S COMPLICATED.

33:13.422 --> 33:15.164
HEY, SUSAN!

33:15.164 --> 33:19.068
M.J. TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

33:20.669 --> 33:23.632
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU,
ACTUALLY.

33:23.632 --> 33:26.705
ME? (chuckles nervously)
WHAT ABOUT ME?

33:26.705 --> 33:30.179
WELL...

33:30.179 --> 33:33.512
I REALIZED THAT I NEVER
PROPERLY CONGRATULATED YOU

33:33.512 --> 33:35.514
ON GETTING MARRIED.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.047
REALLY?

33:40.689 --> 33:43.252
REALLY.

33:43.252 --> 33:45.124
(sighs)

33:45.124 --> 33:46.725
(chuckles)

33:49.658 --> 33:52.661
HEY, BABE.
HOW'D THE TEST GO?

33:56.235 --> 33:58.267
IT'S AS THOUGH...

33:58.267 --> 33:59.708
I DUG DOWN DEEP

33:59.708 --> 34:02.441
AND I FOUND
A NEW LEVEL OF SUCK

34:02.441 --> 34:04.443
THAT I NEVER KNEW
I HAD IN ME.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.216
I'M SURE
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

34:07.216 --> 34:09.378
LYNETTE...

34:11.449 --> 34:13.752
I PUKED TEQUILA
IN THE PARKING LOT,

34:13.752 --> 34:17.054
I-I PASSED OUT TWICE
IN THE ESSAY SECTION,

34:17.054 --> 34:20.489
AND I GIGGLED UNCONTROLLABLY
WHEN I READ THE WORD "URANUS."

34:20.489 --> 34:25.094
ADD TO THAT THAT I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT I SPELLED "SCAVO" WRONG,

34:25.094 --> 34:28.097
AND IT IS A SAFE BET
THAT I WILL NOT BE

34:28.097 --> 34:30.399
BROADENING MY HORIZONS
ANYTIME SOON.

34:30.399 --> 34:32.601
HEY.

34:32.601 --> 34:34.543
DON'T SWEAT IT.

34:34.543 --> 34:36.475
YOU WANTED TO LEARN CHINESE...
(kisses)

34:36.475 --> 34:38.476
MM, WE'LL GET YOU A BOOK.

34:38.476 --> 34:43.452
MANDARIN IS
A VERY COMPLICATED LANGUAGE.
 (beeping)

34:43.452 --> 34:45.754
YOU CAN'T GET THE KIND
OF FLUENCY YOU NEED

34:45.754 --> 34:48.456
FOR THE PROFESSIONAL MARKETPLACE
FROM A BOOK.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.161
MARKETPLACE?

34:52.161 --> 34:54.623
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

34:54.623 --> 34:59.228
CHINA IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S
FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIES.

34:59.228 --> 35:02.401
THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOMEONE
WITH MY MARKETING EXPERIENCE

35:02.401 --> 35:04.703
WHO CAN SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
ARE AMAZING.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.705
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING
BEAUCOUP BUCKS.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.708
I COULD'VE
TOTALLY REINVENTED MYSELF.

35:12.441 --> 35:14.743
THAT'S...

35:14.743 --> 35:16.745
A BRILLIANT PLAN.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.749
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS?

35:22.491 --> 35:24.493
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

35:26.825 --> 35:28.357
IT'S OVER.

35:31.400 --> 35:34.563
(sighs)

35:34.563 --> 35:36.565
I'M SORRY I LET YOU DOWN.

35:44.313 --> 35:46.375
WOW.

35:46.375 --> 35:48.377
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
 THIS WEEKEND?

35:48.377 --> 35:50.379
YEAH. THAT'S THE GOOD THING
ABOUT VEGAS.

35:50.379 --> 35:52.681
DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY PLANNING.
 (gasps) OH, MY GOSH.

35:52.681 --> 35:55.384
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH US?

35:55.384 --> 35:57.686
YOU COULD BE
MY MAID OF HONOR.

35:59.328 --> 36:01.560
THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
ISN'T IT?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.832
IT'S SWEET, BUT...

36:03.832 --> 36:05.894
YEAH, IT'S RIDICULOUS.
(laughs)

36:05.894 --> 36:07.736
AND BESIDES, UM,

36:07.736 --> 36:10.899
M.J. AND I HAVE BIG PLANS
THIS WEEKEND.

36:30.589 --> 36:34.593
(bird cawing)

36:34.593 --> 36:37.426
(front door opens and closes)

36:39.768 --> 36:41.570
HEY, DAVE.

36:42.971 --> 36:44.473
GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

36:44.473 --> 36:48.277
IS YOUR FRIEND'S BOAT
STILL AVAILABLE THIS WEEKEND?

36:48.277 --> 36:49.578
WHAT?

36:49.578 --> 36:52.581
WELL, I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID, AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

36:52.581 --> 36:56.615
IT REALLY WOULD DO ME GOOD TO
GET OUT OF HERE FOR A FEW DAYS.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.887
YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:58.887 --> 37:03.522
IT WOULD DO US ALL SOME GOOD.
(chuckles nervously)

37:14.533 --> 37:16.965
CARLOS!

37:16.965 --> 37:20.839
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME,

37:20.839 --> 37:22.841
KNOWING THAT YOU AND GABY

37:22.841 --> 37:27.376
WILL BE LOOKING AFTER
MY BEAUTIFUL ANA.

37:27.376 --> 37:30.549
I CAN FINALLY BE AT PEACE.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.880
OHH.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.283
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

37:34.283 --> 37:37.426
AND TELL GABY
I SAID THANK YOU.

37:37.426 --> 37:39.428
(chuckles) BYE.

37:41.490 --> 37:45.564
SO... ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM
THE TRUTH ABOUT ANA?

37:45.564 --> 37:47.866
OH, THEY'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

37:50.499 --> 37:52.541
(clink)

37:52.541 --> 37:56.044
(telephone rings)

37:56.044 --> 37:57.576
HELLO?

37:57.576 --> 38:00.479
(woman) Hi. I'm trying
to reach Roberta Simmonds.

38:00.479 --> 38:03.582
SPEAKING, BUT BARELY.
WHO'S THIS?

38:03.582 --> 38:05.314
This is Claire Cormier,

38:05.314 --> 38:07.486
DR. HELLER'S RECEPTIONIST.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.957
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

38:08.957 --> 38:10.489
YEAH, SURE.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.661
BUT I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY BREAKFAST,

38:12.661 --> 38:15.794
SO IF YOU'D CALL ME BACK
AROUND 11:00...
 I just thought
you might wanna know

38:15.794 --> 38:17.866
THE POLICE STOPPED BY.

38:17.866 --> 38:20.469
THEY TOLD ME
THAT DR. HELLER IS DEAD.

38:20.469 --> 38:24.803
YEAH, GO ON. I'M LISTENING.

38:24.803 --> 38:29.538
DR. HELLER DIED IN A FIRE
AT THE WHITE HORSE?

38:29.538 --> 38:32.040
AND APPARENTLY, THERE WAS
NO SMOKE IN HIS LUNGS.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.614
WHICH MEANS HE WAS DEAD
BEFORE THE FIRE STARTED.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.446
MY GUESS?

38:37.446 --> 38:40.519
THE PERSON HE WAS COMING TO SEE
IS THE PERSON WHO KILLED HIM.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.320
DAVE.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.322
DAVE.

38:46.555 --> 38:49.558
ROBERTA, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
 GO TO THE POLICE.

38:49.558 --> 38:53.562
AND TELL 'EM WHAT?
 WELL, WE KNOW DR. HELLER WAS
A CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGIST,

38:53.562 --> 38:55.864
AND WE'RE PRETTY SURE
DAVE WAS HIS PATIENT.

38:55.864 --> 38:57.866
I'D FEEL BETTER
IF WE HAD PROOF.

38:57.866 --> 39:00.068
I'D FEEL BETTER IF I HAD
A FUNCTIONING LIVER,

39:00.068 --> 39:03.341
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PLAY
THE HAND YOU'RE DEALT.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.344
IF WE WALK INTO THE POLICE
WITH A HALF-COCKED STORY,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.346
THEY'RE GONNA LAUGH US
OUT OF THE STATION.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.818
I DON'T KNOW HOW,

39:09.818 --> 39:12.481
BUT WE--WE GOTTA GIVE 'EM
SOMETHING MORE.

39:12.481 --> 39:15.684
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME DAVE
ONCE BROKE INTO YOUR HOUSE?

39:15.684 --> 39:18.487
YEAH. WHY?

39:18.487 --> 39:23.492
MAYBE IT'S TIME
WE RETURNED THE FAVOR.

39:23.492 --> 39:26.965
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU MISSED
YOUR APPOINTMENT ON MONDAY,

39:26.965 --> 39:30.799
WE THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU SKIPPED OUT ON US.

39:30.799 --> 39:34.703
YEAH, WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE,
I WAS OTHERWISE DETAINED.

39:34.703 --> 39:37.506
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

39:39.908 --> 39:42.080
NO.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.982
WHO IS HE?

39:43.982 --> 39:47.616
SAMUEL HELLER--THE JOHN DOE
WHO DIED IN THE CLUB FIRE.

39:47.616 --> 39:50.619
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM WHEN
YOU WERE IN THAT BACK HALLWAY?

39:50.619 --> 39:52.060
NO.

39:52.060 --> 39:54.062
WELL,
LIKE I TOLD YOU THAT NIGHT,

39:54.062 --> 39:56.064
I WAS ONLY BACK THERE
FOR A MINUTE.

39:56.064 --> 39:58.066
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY?

39:58.066 --> 40:00.529
AW, JEEZ,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

40:00.529 --> 40:02.831
NO. I WAS LOOKING
FOR THE MEN'S ROOM.

40:02.831 --> 40:05.173
I RAN INTO DAVE WILLIAMS.

40:05.173 --> 40:07.676
HE WAS COMING OUT
OF THE STORAGE ROOM--

40:07.676 --> 40:10.639
WAIT. YOU SAW DAVE WILLIAMS
COMING OUT OF THE STORAGE ROOM?

40:10.639 --> 40:12.811
YEAH.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.544
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT
BEFORE?

40:15.544 --> 40:17.586
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE BATHROOM,

40:17.586 --> 40:19.948
BUT DAVE POINTED ME
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.723
AND RIGHT AFTER THAT,
SOMEBODY LOCKED YOU IN.

40:24.723 --> 40:28.727
COME ON. YOU DON'T THINK
DAVE DID THAT.

40:28.727 --> 40:32.761
I DON'T KNOW.
HE HAVE ANY REASON TO HARM YOU?

40:32.761 --> 40:35.203
NO.

40:35.203 --> 40:37.205
WE'RE FRIENDS.

40:37.205 --> 40:39.708
HE'S ONE OF THE NICEST GUYS
I'VE EVER MET.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.113
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MR. BRADDOCK.

40:45.113 --> 40:49.117
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
BE MORE HELP.

40:50.719 --> 40:54.553
HOW MANY TIMES WE TALK
TO THIS WILLIAMS GUY?
 (door closes)

40:54.553 --> 40:57.055
OH, I DON'T KNOW. FOUR?

40:57.055 --> 41:01.660
HE EVER MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT
BEING IN THAT STORAGE ROOM?

41:01.660 --> 41:03.792
HE DID NOT.

41:20.509 --> 41:23.151
AND I'M GONNA CATCH A FISH
THIS BIG.

41:23.151 --> 41:25.854
WELL, IF YOU DO,
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN IT

41:25.854 --> 41:29.658
AND SERVE IT UP FOR DINNER.
 AND IF I DON'T,
CAN WE EAT THE WORMS?

41:29.658 --> 41:32.561
(laughs)
 (laughs) JUST MAKE SURE
HE CATCHES A FISH.

41:32.561 --> 41:35.624
HEY, MIKE,
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

41:35.624 --> 41:38.597
IT'S A VIDEO FROM OUR BAND,
ONE OF OUR EARLY REHEARSALS.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.829
MAN, DO I EVEN WANT
TO SEE THIS?

41:40.829 --> 41:42.831
YEAH. WE WEREN'T HALF BAD.

41:42.831 --> 41:45.834
DON'T WATCH IT TILL YOU GET BACK
FROM YOUR HONEYMOON. OKAY?

41:45.834 --> 41:48.707
WILL DO. THANKS.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.540
OKAY. (sighs)

41:51.540 --> 41:53.882
(sighs)
 BYE, MIKE.

41:53.882 --> 41:55.584
HAVE A NICE WEDDING.

41:55.584 --> 41:57.515
THANKS.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.517
(chuckles)

42:04.522 --> 42:06.524
(sighs)

42:08.156 --> 42:09.758
(click, door closes)

42:09.758 --> 42:12.701
YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY BOY,
OKAY?

42:12.701 --> 42:15.203
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

42:17.265 --> 42:19.868
(starts engine)

42:19.868 --> 42:21.870
(shifts gears)
