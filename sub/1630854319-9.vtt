00:05.073 --> 00:07.275
<i>Grant that,
through this mystery,</i>

00:07.275 --> 00:10.078
<i>your servant
Theodore Marcus Graves,</i>

00:10.078 --> 00:13.281
who has gone to his rest
in Christ,

00:13.281 --> 00:15.283
may share in the joy

00:15.283 --> 00:17.685
of his resurrection.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.620
Forgive whatever sins

00:19.620 --> 00:21.355
he committed
through human weakness,

00:21.355 --> 00:25.293
and in your goodness grant him
everlasting peace.

00:25.293 --> 00:28.129
How do we still not know
what happened?

00:28.129 --> 00:30.764
I can't get anything
when it comes to the police.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.300
I'm a leper. I'm sorry.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.568
"His line is gone out through
all the earth.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.104
"In them hath he set

00:36.104 --> 00:37.638
a tabernacle for the sun."

00:37.638 --> 00:41.542
...who has gone to his rest
in Christ...

01:14.675 --> 01:17.245
Wait. Don't do that. Stop, stop.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.812
Hey, what are you doing?

01:18.812 --> 01:21.549
I'm trying to keep you
from pulling out the IV.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.420
Billy.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.056
Hey.

01:29.056 --> 01:31.359
You're... you're not a nurse.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.162
How do you know?

01:34.162 --> 01:37.831
You never asked me
what I did for a living.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.167
But then again,
it was hard to hear anything

01:39.167 --> 01:40.268
from under that leather hood.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.370
No.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.071
Hey, no. No. Ah!

01:44.071 --> 01:47.208
Fighting with my nurse won't
improve your condition, Sam.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.809
Theo?

01:50.077 --> 01:52.045
I prefer Doctor.

01:52.045 --> 01:55.716
I see you were admitted
with <i>Pneumocystis</i> pneumonia.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.418
It's a pretty serious infection

01:57.418 --> 01:59.653
caused by
a fairly common fungus.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.621
What?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.055
It usually resolves on its own,

02:02.055 --> 02:03.691
but your immune system

02:03.691 --> 02:05.793
doesn't seem to be responding.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.528
- No.
- I need...

02:07.528 --> 02:09.897
I need to see a real doctor.
Just get me out of this dump!

02:09.897 --> 02:11.699
Hey.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.867
Unfortunately,

02:13.867 --> 02:15.903
this is the only hospital
that would see you.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.773
People are afraid of this thing.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.743
They're afraid of you.

03:36.149 --> 03:39.186
I'm glad you're on your feet.

03:39.186 --> 03:42.155
It's hard for me
to see you like this.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.359
You were always so vital.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.462
So were you.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.766
Theo, I don't know what happened
to you that night.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.369
I didn't kill you, did I?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.439
Did you intend to kill me, Sam?

04:00.474 --> 04:01.875
I don't think so.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.544
That should've been
an easy answer.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.648
What about the others?

04:07.648 --> 04:08.849
The others?

04:08.849 --> 04:12.553
The other lives you devoured.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.055
You spent a lifetime looking
away from the consequences

04:15.055 --> 04:17.224
of your actions,

04:17.224 --> 04:19.727
but everything catches up
to you in the end.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.797
Where are you taking me?
I don't like this game.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.702
Do you remember when I told you
that something was coming?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.038
That I could feel it?

04:31.038 --> 04:33.307
- Yes.
- Well...

04:33.307 --> 04:35.743
that something's here.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.394
Oh, Christ, that smell.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.062
No, I don't want
to come in here.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.365
No one else will, Sam.
That's why you have to.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.400
Come on.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.112
What happened to him?

05:12.112 --> 05:14.281
He was admitted
about a month ago

05:14.281 --> 05:16.116
with the same infection
you have.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.493
Who is that?

05:28.295 --> 05:31.365
That's Danny, Sam.
Don't you remember Danny?

05:31.365 --> 05:33.934
The first guy we opened
our relationship up to.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.104
Danny.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.644
He used to be so beautiful.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.712
And more than that,

05:44.712 --> 05:47.781
he was a very talented writer.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.116
I knew that.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.685
He wrote a one-man play.
It was...

05:51.685 --> 05:53.721
really good.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.491
He had a kind of flair.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.293
Did you go see it? The play?

06:00.293 --> 06:03.431
No, no, he-he got me tickets...

06:03.431 --> 06:04.798
but, no, I didn't go.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.000
And you never
brought it up again, did you?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.470
Danny thought
you had seen the play, Sam.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.839
- He thought you didn't know how
to tell him that you hated it.
- What?

06:11.839 --> 06:15.509
I never told him
that he didn't have talent.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.878
Well, you didn't tell him
anything, Sam,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.347
and that's the impression
that you left.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.150
Oh, my God.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.919
Oh, God. Help him.
Theo, help him.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.521
- There's no use, Sam.
- Somebody help him!

06:27.521 --> 06:28.622
There's no one there
to hear you.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.023
Why did you bring me here?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.125
Isn't that what you do?
You show things

06:32.125 --> 06:33.761
to your clients that
they've never seen before.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.963
- Things they'll never forget.
- This is not my fault.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.432
Come on. There's more to see.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.420
Stewart.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.089
He was sick before he met you,

07:02.089 --> 07:04.024
but he didn't know it yet.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.427
The doctors don't understand
why he's wasting away so fast.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.362
He was fine
when we were together.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.031
- Better than fine.
- Was that before

07:11.031 --> 07:13.901
or after you wouldn't let him
out of the cage?

07:17.471 --> 07:20.440
I was coked up, Theo.
I got carried away.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.110
I have always pushed the limits.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.779
"I, I, I."

07:25.779 --> 07:28.248
Look beyond yourself, Sam.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.584
What about him?

07:34.121 --> 07:36.056
I shouldn't be here.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.525
He doesn't know it's you, Sam.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.160
- Give him a kiss.
- What?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.995
He needs compassion.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.167
I'm sorry.
You've asked the wrong person.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.271
It's not my place.

07:51.271 --> 07:54.307
It's everyone's place
to show love, Sam.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.167
Please, Theo.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.603
I'm so tired.
I need to get to my room.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.705
That's where we're headed.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.849
This is not my room.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.918
It is, Sam.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.720
Go inside.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.274
How long have I been here?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.312
Long enough to be forgotten.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.881
I would never be left
to rot like this.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.684
There are people who love me.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.020
It's one thing
to be celebrated, Sam.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.591
It's another thing entirely
to be loved.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.832
You've surrounded yourself
with beautiful people

09:24.832 --> 09:26.700
who loved beautiful things.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.904
But those beautiful people--

09:30.904 --> 09:32.973
they don't have a taste
for this kind of beauty.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.584
What happened to me?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.554
Your immune system
continued to decay,

09:47.554 --> 09:50.390
and your body lost
all ability to fight off

09:50.390 --> 09:53.694
even the smallest infection.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.863
The lesions on your skin,

09:55.863 --> 09:57.264
those are nothing compared

09:57.264 --> 09:59.166
to what's happening
inside your body.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.835
What about medication?

10:01.835 --> 10:04.772
I'll pay. I don't care
how much it costs.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.141
There's no cure for this.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.612
Money can't buy
your way out this time.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.249
Do something. Help him.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.486
Help me. Do something!
I can't die like this.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.921
I don't deserve
to die like this.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.056
Theo, do something! Help me!

10:23.056 --> 10:24.157
Please.

10:27.895 --> 10:28.962
Help me.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.700
Somebody help me.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.792
Hello?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.531
Hello?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.238
Where am I?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.017
What's happening?

11:27.755 --> 11:29.489
Where am I?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.993
Hello?

11:34.795 --> 11:35.863
What's wrong?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.867
Being locked in a cage
isn't as comfy

11:39.867 --> 11:41.534
- as you imagined it to be?
- Get me out of here.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.203
No, no.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.272
We're gonna have a little fun.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.876
Hmm...

11:51.044 --> 11:52.012
Ooh.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.114
What's this?

11:54.114 --> 11:56.516
Gone fishing?

11:56.516 --> 11:58.285
Judge all you want.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.653
Gives a lot of people pleasure.
You wouldn't understand.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.290
No, I wouldn't understand
such grotesque extremes.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.659
It's people like you who make
the world hate people like me.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.095
Says the gay hit man.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.831
You don't know
anything about me.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.134
You and I are not
that dissimilar.

12:14.134 --> 12:17.337
We're both deeply misunderstood,
but there is

12:17.337 --> 12:19.840
one big difference.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.275
I don't believe that my pain

12:22.275 --> 12:25.212
is greater than everyone else's.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.727
It's one thing
to indulge in a fetish.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.598
It's another to enjoy
torturing people.

12:45.598 --> 12:49.036
I give pain to people
to take it away.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.403
Bullshit.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.939
You inflict pain

12:51.939 --> 12:54.674
because you are in pain.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.410
Pain given is pain experienced.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.013
There's an art
to the pain I give.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.548
Not like this.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.716
He's hurting him, really.
Make him stop.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.820
So it's different
with someone you love?

13:06.820 --> 13:08.521
Who is this man, Sam?

13:10.190 --> 13:12.025
- I don't want
to see him like this.
- Look at him.

13:12.025 --> 13:15.128
Sam, look at the man
who caused you the most pain.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.666
- Acknowledge
your father's presence.
- No!

13:19.666 --> 13:21.468
Stop!

13:21.468 --> 13:23.670
Is this where
all the violence began?

13:23.670 --> 13:25.338
Please...

13:25.338 --> 13:27.875
Make it stop!

13:32.980 --> 13:34.181
Ah...

13:34.181 --> 13:37.084
Is this another link
in the chain of violence?

13:37.084 --> 13:38.585
Who is this?

13:38.585 --> 13:41.588
My first boss when I worked
on Wall Street.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.524
Oh, yes. You so

13:44.524 --> 13:48.328
badly wanted the approval
of those cavemen.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.629
They were never
gonna accept a faggot

13:49.629 --> 13:50.663
like you into their league.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.999
I worked harder than anyone

13:51.999 --> 13:53.333
at that firm.

13:54.801 --> 13:58.038
I was smarter and faster
than all of them combined,

13:58.038 --> 13:59.873
and they still made me
feel so small,

13:59.873 --> 14:01.108
so worthless.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.911
You left finance
and you became a collector.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.778
Hoarding art and men and money

14:05.778 --> 14:07.614
just to show
those Wall Street boys.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.150
No one was ever gonna
take away my power ever again.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.719
You can't blame me

14:12.719 --> 14:14.387
for having some self-respect.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.956
Is that what you call this?

14:45.385 --> 14:48.155
I'm not afraid of you.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.357
I am the one

14:50.357 --> 14:52.592
- who should be feared.
- Ooh.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.661
So defensive.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.229
Is that how you talk
to your God?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.897
Get me out of here!

14:57.897 --> 14:59.066
Time to face him, Sam.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.468
Your fear. Your chaos.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.602
Your shame.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.337
Your shadow.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.440
Avoiding him now

15:07.440 --> 15:10.510
is only gonna
make it more painful.

15:10.510 --> 15:14.347
Help! Let me go!

15:50.583 --> 15:51.618
Sam,

15:51.618 --> 15:53.320
you can't outrun him.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.856
You're too slow.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.704
The darkness always wins.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.110
All we can ever do

16:17.110 --> 16:19.579
is...

16:19.579 --> 16:21.748
transcend.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.258
Well done, Sam.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.227
Well done.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.597
Your IV drip is empty.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.565
When was the last time
the nurse checked on you?

20:34.534 --> 20:35.602
Okay, shh, shh.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.415
Goddamn it. Where is everyone?

20:51.851 --> 20:54.086
I'm bringing you water.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.430
- You got it?
- Mm-hmm.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.400
Okay.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.068
There you go.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.879
There you go.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.881
Okay?

21:30.890 --> 21:34.427
Okay.

21:34.427 --> 21:37.997
I... picked up your meds.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.404
Mr. Read.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.872
It's about time.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.574
Where the fuck is everybody?

21:47.574 --> 21:50.209
His drip is empty, and when
was the last time he was fed?

21:50.209 --> 21:51.310
Can you give us
the room, please?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.479
Anything that you have to say

21:52.479 --> 21:53.946
to him, you can say to me.
I'm his lover.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.482
If you're not a relative,
then it's against

21:55.482 --> 21:56.716
- the hospital policy...
- Oh, come on.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.217
He can stay. Please,
he can stay. He can stay.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.218
Fine.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.319
Please sit.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.789
Come sit down.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.057
We've, uh,

22:05.057 --> 22:07.293
gotten back
your retinal imagining, and

22:07.293 --> 22:09.562
unfortunately the
cytomegalovirus has completely

22:09.562 --> 22:13.099
detached both retinas
from the backs of your eyes.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.634
So, what-what does that mean?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.002
The blindness is permanent.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.372
But, I mean, can't you operate?

22:19.372 --> 22:20.673
It's a, it's a, it's a

22:20.673 --> 22:23.009
detachment, so you just,
you reattach it.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.045
AIDS patients aren't eligible
for these kinds of operations.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.280
They're not eligible?

22:28.280 --> 22:29.716
Even if he was,

22:29.716 --> 22:31.083
it's a complicated procedure.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.619
You know, this is what
you people always say.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.422
It's always too complicated.
You're a doctor.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.923
If you don't have
any other questions,

22:36.923 --> 22:38.257
I will leave you two alone.

22:38.257 --> 22:39.526
Oh, I have plenty
of other questions.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.927
When is a cure coming?
Why isn't it here yet?

22:40.927 --> 22:42.028
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.463
This is a fucking horror.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.297
Gino...

22:45.297 --> 22:47.734
can't you just be here with me?

22:50.837 --> 22:52.271
I'm scared.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.448
You want some applesauce?

23:01.448 --> 23:03.516
I got the good kind,
the kind with the cinnamon.

23:03.516 --> 23:04.617
Okay.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.719
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.224
Okay.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.763
Here we go.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.899
Okay. Okay, here we go. Right...

23:19.899 --> 23:22.234
there, right there.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.642
Fuck.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.678
Oh, fuck.

23:31.678 --> 23:34.113
Oh, shit.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.648
Ugh...

23:38.785 --> 23:41.420
I want you to sell
my life insurance policy.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.256
There's a cash reserve.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.658
It'll pay for my funeral.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.727
Come on, come on,
don't talk like that, Patrick.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.361
- This...
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
come on.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.899
If you don't sell it,
it'll just go to my parents.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.937
I don't want that, okay?

23:57.937 --> 24:00.907
I don't want it to go to them.
I want it to go to you.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.775
Please.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.747
- Okay. I promise.
- Yeah?

24:07.747 --> 24:08.781
Mm-hmm.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.851
I love you so much.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.231
Okay, all right, here.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.589
Uh... help.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.194
Help me, please.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.152
Shit.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.394
Ow.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.961
Anybody?

26:36.729 --> 26:38.030
Hello?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.338
Nurse?

26:49.541 --> 26:50.576
Nurse?

26:53.312 --> 26:54.513
Somebody there?

26:57.984 --> 26:59.285
Hello?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.488
Who's that? Please.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.991
Speak up, please, please.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.932
Open your eyes.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.968
They are open.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.671
Look at me, Patrick.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.974
I can't, I can't...

27:35.487 --> 27:36.989
I can see.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.160
I can see.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.931
I can s-see... I can see you.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.198
I can see.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.203
You cried when
you saw me in this.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.612
Are you here to punish me?

28:00.612 --> 28:01.881
No.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.952
Sweetheart...

28:07.019 --> 28:09.255
There's nothing left of you
to punish.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.358
I'm here to help you see.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.531
Do you remember this?

28:54.700 --> 28:57.303
Hey. <i>Downtown Native.</i>

28:57.303 --> 28:58.537
You gonna tell me
what happened here,

28:58.537 --> 28:59.972
or am I gonna have to
figure it out myself?

28:59.972 --> 29:02.008
Okay, do me a favor
and mind the line.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.375
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.777
- I'll mind it.
- Gino.

29:04.777 --> 29:08.280
The day after Halloween, 1980.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.917
It was the day
you two first met.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.353
We were still married,
but you were unhappy.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.255
All right, now your turn,
what's the story?

29:16.255 --> 29:18.057
Okay, saucebox.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.960
The story is, the kid fell
from the fire escape.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.695
Oh, that explains the mess.

29:23.695 --> 29:26.232
He threw himself out the window
high on PCP.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.000
An angel on angel dust.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.602
- Right.
- There's got to be
another way out.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.872
People like us.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.207
We just need
someplace to go, right?

29:36.742 --> 29:37.910
How do you mean?

29:37.910 --> 29:40.179
Somewhere to go.
Do you want to...?

29:40.179 --> 29:42.648
What?
Do I, do I, do I want to what?

29:42.648 --> 29:44.583
There was something
about his swagger.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.293
I'm Gino.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.728
Don't keep me flapping too long.

30:09.942 --> 30:12.411
August 1977...

30:12.411 --> 30:14.914
There was a holdup at a bodega

30:14.914 --> 30:16.582
and your partner
shot the suspect.

30:18.417 --> 30:19.418
Here we go, here you go.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.022
He was gonna shoot first, right?

30:23.022 --> 30:25.491
- Right, Patrick?
- Right.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.693
You did the right thing, Steve.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.896
We'll take the report later.
Go get him cleaned up.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.931
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, God.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.065
Oh, God.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.067
Come on, it's okay, come on.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.506
Steve shouldn't have
pulled his trigger.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.474
You had things under control.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.110
What have I done?

30:44.110 --> 30:46.612
Now there was blood
on your hands.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.247
You know what? I'd...

30:48.247 --> 30:51.117
I'd have done exactly
the same thing, buddy.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.451
Really.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.753
A lie.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.756
But you already knew how shame
could break a young man.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.425
You got a, uh...

30:59.425 --> 31:02.461
Behind your ear...

31:11.370 --> 31:12.905
Come here, come here.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.575
Okay?

31:16.575 --> 31:18.410
You could be so tender

31:18.410 --> 31:20.379
when you let
yourself be, Patrick.

31:47.473 --> 31:48.941
What the hell?

31:48.941 --> 31:50.709
It was either you or him.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.878
More blood down the drain...

31:52.878 --> 31:54.346
Fuck away from me, faggot!

31:54.346 --> 31:56.148
What the fuck
is going on in there?

31:56.148 --> 31:58.951
He just, uh, he came onto me.
He was kissing my fucking face!

31:58.951 --> 32:01.087
Get out of here, Read. Go!

32:02.854 --> 32:05.024
It was a violent lie.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.193
One that wounded you both.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.898
The shame. The lies.
The violence.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.834
It's a cycle, Patrick.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.736
Get the fuck out.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.306
You didn't start it,

32:20.306 --> 32:23.875
but that didn't stop it from
breaking you into pieces.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.958
Oh, God.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.031
I can't do it.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.266
Almost. You're close.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.602
Just make the parts fit.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.271
I don't want to.

32:53.539 --> 32:54.773
Neither did I.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.509
But I did it to help people.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.011
To help people like me.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.047
People who needed my help
because no one else would.

33:01.047 --> 33:04.583
But it's so... ugly.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.685
Oh, here we go.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.520
So what?

33:08.520 --> 33:10.822
The scars are not attractive?

33:10.822 --> 33:13.025
Maybe you could
cover them up, then.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.560
You'll be all right.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.595
Hide them under a uniform.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.466
Put on the head.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.204
Ugh. Never mind.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.872
I'll do it myself.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.990
This is you, Patrick.

33:44.990 --> 33:46.092
You were botched up,

33:46.092 --> 33:48.127
just a mess of a person

33:48.127 --> 33:51.029
throwing yourself down
all those escape hatches.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.466
You gathered up all those pieces

33:54.466 --> 33:58.470
and put yourself back together
over and over again.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.806
Why did you keep doing that?

34:02.040 --> 34:03.809
Did it make it stop?

34:04.943 --> 34:06.512
What?

34:06.512 --> 34:08.914
That pain.

34:10.216 --> 34:13.352
The pain that made you tear
yourself up in the first place.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.887
Your body will keep
reminding you of it

34:15.887 --> 34:17.323
until you face that.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.291
Face what?

34:20.359 --> 34:23.162
This, son,
is a snub-nosed revolver.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.131
Easy to handle.

34:25.131 --> 34:26.632
Powerful for its size.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.100
Plenty of people met God...

34:28.100 --> 34:29.835
I really don't want to be here.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.504
You need to face this moment.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.106
I remember what happens.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.778
Now... your turn.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.247
Show me your stance, son.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.082
Good.
Get the target in sight.

34:44.082 --> 34:47.319
Hold steady, then shoot.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.366
You're not hitting the target

35:00.366 --> 35:01.867
because your grip
isn't firm enough.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.202
Huh, you what they call that?

35:03.202 --> 35:05.404
- Limp wristing.
- Yes, sir.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.183
So, how about it?
Are you a limp wrist?

35:17.183 --> 35:19.251
- No, sir.
- Then prove it.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.452
Don't you want to wear a badge

35:20.452 --> 35:22.454
like your old man
and your grandpa, huh?

35:22.454 --> 35:24.456
Make us proud.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.763
Steady your aim

35:31.763 --> 35:34.132
and hit the goddamn
target this time.

35:37.035 --> 35:39.004
Come on.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.810
Goddamn it!

35:44.810 --> 35:47.179
Your sissy little limp wrist
is gonna get us killed!

35:48.980 --> 35:50.382
Goddamn it.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.053
I didn't know if he was
reloading for the target

35:55.053 --> 35:56.655
or for me.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.525
I can do it.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.893
Do what? Huh? This?

36:01.893 --> 36:04.763
And this? And this?

36:05.797 --> 36:06.898
And this?

36:06.898 --> 36:09.435
You can't even handle the sound.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.403
Think we had earmuffs
on Okinawa?

36:11.403 --> 36:13.639
Huh, cover our ears
like little girls?

36:13.639 --> 36:16.375
Had to fire and fight because
it was kill or be killed.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.009
We're done.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.334
It's worse than I remember.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.124
Gino.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.793
Hmm?

37:07.793 --> 37:10.696
I'm glad you're here.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.532
I wouldn't want to be
anywhere else.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.005
I'm sorry.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.508
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.576
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.579
You don't have anything
to be sorry about.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.922
I don't know...

37:36.922 --> 37:38.857
what's real.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.459
I know.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.729
It's the sickness, baby.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.697
It's okay, I got you.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.936
Okay, I got you.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.738
It's okay.

38:04.650 --> 38:09.788
<i>Ooh... ♪</i>
