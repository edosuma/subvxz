WEBVTT

01:16.491 --> 01:17.796
Hey, there.
Sorry to bother you, folks,

01:17.970 --> 01:20.190
but, uh, we're looking
for an individual.

01:20.364 --> 01:22.018
Golden-brown complexion.

01:22.192 --> 01:23.454
15 pounds.

01:23.628 --> 01:24.760
No head.

01:24.934 --> 01:26.501
I know where he is.

01:26.675 --> 01:28.851
I'll even serve him up
on a silver platter for you.

01:29.025 --> 01:30.679
Now get in here.

01:30.853 --> 01:32.463
I'm glad to see you finally
out of your man cave.

01:32.637 --> 01:34.335
Well, you know, Amanda
can be pretty convincing

01:34.509 --> 01:36.206
- when she wants to be.
- Hey, babe. Eric's here.

01:36.380 --> 01:37.947
Hey, Amanda.

01:38.121 --> 01:39.775
Well, well, well, well.

01:39.949 --> 01:41.951
- You made it.
- Yeah.

01:42.125 --> 01:43.344
Sorry.

01:43.518 --> 01:45.476
Thomas. One second.

01:45.650 --> 01:47.652
I baked this for you.
I couldn't eat it by myself.

01:47.826 --> 01:49.045
It would just be too depressing.

01:49.219 --> 01:50.438
Wow.

01:50.612 --> 01:51.917
You baked this?

01:52.092 --> 01:53.093
Yeah, you know,
for a single guy,

01:53.267 --> 01:54.964
I know my way around the oven.

01:55.138 --> 01:57.923
Ah... A guy in uniform
who knows how to bake.

01:58.098 --> 02:00.056
I have a feeling you're not
gonna be single for long.

02:00.230 --> 02:01.797
Come on. You remember my mom, right?

02:01.971 --> 02:03.364
- Hey, Mom, remember Eric?
Oh, hey.

02:03.538 --> 02:05.017
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.585
Uh, do you want any or...?: No, no.

02:07.759 --> 02:09.065
Jeans and a sweater?

02:09.239 --> 02:11.459
You could at least
make an effort.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.983
Casual's more my thing, Kathleen.

02:14.157 --> 02:15.724
Especially in my own house.

02:15.898 --> 02:18.988
Don't you mean "our house" now?

02:19.162 --> 02:20.207
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hi, Dad.

02:20.381 --> 02:21.686
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.297
Oh, thank God you're back, Thomas.

02:23.471 --> 02:25.647
Thought we'd be eating
a frozen turkey dinner.

02:25.821 --> 02:27.823
This guy.

02:29.390 --> 02:31.087
Sorry, Rob.
Yeah, this is the first time

02:31.261 --> 02:32.915
the store's open
on Thanksgiving.

02:33.089 --> 02:35.526
You know, we always do the,
uh, midnight Black Friday,

02:35.700 --> 02:37.528
but people were showing up
at 6:00 p.m. anyway, so...

02:37.702 --> 02:39.226
And you're a smart man, Thomas.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.662
Yeah, well, credit my beautiful
fiancée over there.

02:40.836 --> 02:42.011
It was her idea.

02:42.185 --> 02:43.404
Well, from what
I've been hearing

02:43.578 --> 02:44.927
about the turnout,
it is going to be

02:45.101 --> 02:47.930
a very happy Thanksgiving.

02:48.104 --> 02:49.584
Here we go.

02:49.758 --> 02:51.847
Oh, that's beautiful. Yes.

02:52.021 --> 02:54.545
Mitch, we need
your carving skills.

02:54.719 --> 02:56.547
I've got time to carve it
but not to eat it.

02:56.721 --> 02:58.984
Oh, what?
- Thomas is not making you work.

02:59.159 --> 03:01.161
Blame Bob.
Apparently, he's AWOL.

03:01.335 --> 03:03.728
Thomas called and said
it's me working or I'm fired.

03:03.902 --> 03:05.469
Oh, sorry, buddy.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.428
Aw! The store shouldn't
even be open.

03:07.602 --> 03:09.125
It's Thanksgiving.

03:09.299 --> 03:10.822
I know, Mary,
but let's face it.

03:10.996 --> 03:12.737
Black Friday starts
on a Thursday now.

03:12.911 --> 03:14.826
Even in Plymouth.

03:17.873 --> 03:19.266
Hey, Bon Jovi,
why don't you get to the back

03:19.440 --> 03:20.745
- of the fucking line, okay?
- Yeah, suck my dick!

03:20.919 --> 03:21.790
We were here first.

03:21.964 --> 03:23.400
Hey, everybody.

03:23.574 --> 03:25.228
Just fucking calm down.

03:25.402 --> 03:27.187
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground, kid!

03:27.361 --> 03:28.971
What the fuck?!

03:29.145 --> 03:31.191
- Jesus, everybody, be patient!
Hey, fuck you!

03:31.365 --> 03:32.931
Let us in, or you'll be
a patient in Mass General.

03:33.105 --> 03:34.411
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

03:34.585 --> 03:35.499
Fucking funny, eh?

03:35.673 --> 03:36.979
The store opens in ten minutes.

03:37.153 --> 03:38.981
You'll get your waffle iron!

03:39.155 --> 03:40.939
- Xanax?
- No, you got a fire hose?

03:42.724 --> 03:43.855
Todd,

03:44.029 --> 03:45.683
I need you at the register.

03:49.818 --> 03:51.733
Thank you.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.043
Bunch of goddamn morons.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.706
When Kathleen sold my dad
this house,

04:08.880 --> 04:10.926
I didn't realize
she was coming with it.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.972
She'll never be able
to replace your mom, Jess.

04:16.148 --> 04:17.628
Yeah.

04:19.456 --> 04:21.371
And look at it this way.

04:21.545 --> 04:23.155
It was a quick engagement,

04:23.330 --> 04:26.333
so hopefully it'll be
a quick divorce.

04:26.507 --> 04:28.073
Please, God.

04:36.908 --> 04:38.606
Oh. Let's go.

04:38.780 --> 04:41.261
- Dad, we're going to the movies.
- Have fun. Uh, Bobby,

04:41.435 --> 04:42.871
I want to hear about
that 19-strikeout game

04:43.045 --> 04:44.133
against UCLA, when you get back.

04:44.307 --> 04:46.004
Deal, Thomas.
Good night, everyone.

04:46.178 --> 04:48.137
Scuba invited Yulia.
He's into her.

04:48.311 --> 04:49.747
Got it. I'll gas him up.

04:49.921 --> 04:51.314
Okay.

04:53.185 --> 04:54.709
Bobby.
Bobby Boucher.

04:54.883 --> 04:57.407
Bobby "Golden Arm"
home for Thanksgiving,

04:57.581 --> 04:58.930
- and my ride or die, J-Money.
- What up, dawg?

04:59.104 --> 05:00.541
I heard you're
the new Friday Night guy.

05:00.715 --> 05:02.847
Ah, I'd better be, with
a 96-mile-per-hour fastball.

05:04.588 --> 05:06.808
- Evan, you are such a dick.
- What?

05:08.113 --> 05:09.332
Yo, nice job beating Hanover.

05:09.506 --> 05:10.899
Scuba, I heard
you were unstoppable.

05:11.073 --> 05:12.204
Thanks, man.
It was a pretty good night

05:12.379 --> 05:13.510
until Tyson Fury over here

05:13.684 --> 05:15.077
almost got us
locked the fuck up.

05:15.251 --> 05:16.774
- Classic Evan.
Why? What happened?

05:16.948 --> 05:18.515
We got in a run-in with
some drunk Hanover assholes.

05:18.689 --> 05:20.082
Fuck Hanover.
- I popped one of them

05:20.256 --> 05:21.866
in the eye,
but this one was too busy

05:22.040 --> 05:23.564
filming herself
to get some fucking footage.

05:23.738 --> 05:25.348
Shit would've
broke the Internets.

05:25.522 --> 05:27.524
You are lucky
I didn't film that, okay?

05:27.698 --> 05:29.091
It was, like,
Waffle House-level cringe.

05:29.265 --> 05:31.049
It was bad.

05:31.223 --> 05:32.747
♪ Crunk ain't dead, crunk ain't
dead, crunk ain't dead... ♪

05:32.921 --> 05:34.183
Fuck Hanover!

05:34.357 --> 05:37.360
Fuck Hanover! Fuck Hanover!

05:37.534 --> 05:39.057
Fuck Hanover!

05:45.237 --> 05:46.804
This fucking traffic
is ridiculous.

05:46.978 --> 05:48.589
Oh, I can't handle
this shit.

05:48.763 --> 05:50.678
Yo.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.070
Pit stop. I need a new phone.

05:52.244 --> 05:53.550
Mine got fucking smashed
in the fight.

05:53.724 --> 05:54.638
We're not going to the store.
It's a zoo.

05:54.812 --> 05:55.987
Whoa, no, no, no, yes, we are,

05:56.161 --> 05:57.467
'cause Evan owes me
a new lipstick.

05:57.641 --> 05:58.599
- Thank you.
- Don't worry, don't worry...

05:58.773 --> 06:00.035
- What?
Guys, I thought

06:00.209 --> 06:01.123
- we were going to the movies.
- Yeah, we-we are.

06:01.297 --> 06:02.298
We are. How am I gonna text

06:02.472 --> 06:03.168
during the movie
without a phone?

06:03.343 --> 06:04.518

06:20.142 --> 06:21.361

Go, go.

06:21.535 --> 06:23.450
Stealth mission, I promise.

06:23.624 --> 06:24.973
You can't park your car here.

06:25.147 --> 06:26.453
It's not a car, it's an SUV.

06:26.627 --> 06:28.150
Hey, babe, c-can I just
stay here, please?

06:28.324 --> 06:30.152
Please don't make me
do this alone. I...

06:30.326 --> 06:31.806
Bobby, can I get a selfie?

06:31.980 --> 06:33.329
Hey, one-one second.
I'll be right back.

06:33.503 --> 06:35.070
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Yo.

06:35.244 --> 06:36.854
Bobby, Bobby,
we have to move.

06:37.028 --> 06:38.334
Yeah, yeah,
one second, one second.

06:38.508 --> 06:40.292
Bobby "Golden Arm,"
all-time record holder

06:40.467 --> 06:42.817
- for strikeouts at Plymouth East!
- Yes, sir.

06:44.732 --> 06:46.342
Hey, Jess.
- Hey.

06:46.516 --> 06:48.605
This is, like, the last place
I thought I'd see you tonight.

06:48.779 --> 06:50.085
Yeah, you and me both.

06:50.259 --> 06:52.174
Your dad's store
is insane right now.

06:52.348 --> 06:53.305
Look at all these people.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.177
Um, sorry, Ryan, I-I have to

06:55.351 --> 06:56.613
- catch up with my friends.
- Oh, I'll walk you.

06:56.787 --> 06:58.572
Come on. Come on.

06:58.746 --> 07:01.531
So, uh, what are you doing
Saturday night?

07:01.705 --> 07:03.054
Going to the Cap with Bobby.

07:03.228 --> 07:05.013
All right, well...
Uh, excuse me...

07:05.187 --> 07:06.841
I'm having a little
get-together with my friends...

07:07.015 --> 07:08.712
Excuse me... and, uh, you know,
if you wanted to come by,

07:08.886 --> 07:10.322
it's just gonna be like
a couple people...

07:10.497 --> 07:12.324
I can't. Bobby's only in town
till Monday, so...

07:12.499 --> 07:13.804
You should just swing by early.

07:13.978 --> 07:15.327
We could, like,
play some drinking games,

07:15.502 --> 07:17.199
have a good time, you know.
I got some kegs.

07:17.373 --> 07:19.244
She's all set, Ryan.
Come on. Let's go.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.422
Excuse me.

07:24.641 --> 07:26.208
Chill out,
he's just helping.

07:26.382 --> 07:28.340
Oh, what a gentleman.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.907
Face it.

07:30.081 --> 07:31.474
As long as Golden Arm's around,
you're toast.

07:31.648 --> 07:33.476
- Scott. Scott.
- Burnt. Toast.

07:33.650 --> 07:36.305
- Shut the fuck up, Scott.
- Burnt soggy toast.

07:36.479 --> 07:38.046
I love you, dude,
but I'm gonna fucking kill you.

07:38.220 --> 07:39.613
Mm, try your best.

07:39.787 --> 07:41.266
Want to open that gate
for us, gentlemen?

07:41.441 --> 07:42.529
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Here, Amanda, get in here.

07:42.703 --> 07:43.965
Oh, my God.

07:44.139 --> 07:45.053
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Sheriff.

07:45.227 --> 07:47.272
Jesus Christ.

07:47.447 --> 07:49.187
Fuck you.

07:49.361 --> 07:50.841
This is insane.

07:51.015 --> 07:53.583
- Yeah. Let's go in the back.
- Okay.

07:56.586 --> 07:58.196
Hey!

07:58.370 --> 08:01.286
Hey, you! We got some
unfinished business, you fuck!

08:01.461 --> 08:03.506
Oh, fuck, that's the guy
from Hanover I punched.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.594
Fuck you!

08:04.768 --> 08:05.726
Suck my cock!

08:05.900 --> 08:06.727
Pussy.

08:06.901 --> 08:07.815
Hey, fuck you!

08:07.989 --> 08:09.120
Fuck your mom, fucking pussies!

08:09.294 --> 08:10.905
Yo, Lonnie,
where's your mom at? -Hey!

08:11.079 --> 08:12.646
- That's what I thought!
- Fuck your cousin,

08:12.820 --> 08:14.212
your second cousin
and fuck your dog!

08:14.386 --> 08:16.214
Let's just get what you need
and get out of here.

08:16.388 --> 08:17.955
In and out, I promise.

08:18.129 --> 08:19.783
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:19.957 --> 08:22.569
Why are you fucking letting
those fucking jerkoffs in there?

08:22.743 --> 08:25.180
Hello? I fucking see you.

08:25.354 --> 08:27.182
It's Thanks-fucking-giving!

08:27.356 --> 08:29.271
It's an American holiday!

08:29.445 --> 08:30.925
Come on, man.
It's a pizza oven.

08:31.099 --> 08:33.144
- Where do you think it goes?
Sorry, Mitch.

08:33.318 --> 08:35.103
Ten minutes, people.
Please, come on.

08:35.277 --> 08:36.800
- Hi. Surprise.
- Hey.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.193
Hey, babe.
What are you doing here?

08:38.367 --> 08:40.064
I came in with Eric.

08:40.238 --> 08:41.370
I didn't want you to starve
- on Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

08:41.544 --> 08:42.937
I got a call on the radio

08:43.111 --> 08:44.547
about needing some
crowd control.
Uh, yeah.

08:44.721 --> 08:46.593
In fact, you should
probably wait in here, okay?

08:46.767 --> 08:47.768
Okay. Are you okay?

08:47.942 --> 08:48.899
Yeah. We should... Yeah?

08:49.073 --> 08:50.466
- We should go.
- Be careful.

08:53.208 --> 08:54.644
Fucking guy Lonnie's
30 years old.

08:54.818 --> 08:55.819
Dude, he's just madHe got held back

08:55.993 --> 08:57.560
- I took his mom to prom.
- Two years

08:57.734 --> 08:59.170
- and she gave me a handy.
- And he's dating a cheerleader.

08:59.344 --> 09:00.650
Hey, Jess, does your dad
still sell shock collars?

09:00.824 --> 09:02.652
- Or a tranquilizer?
- Or a sedative?

09:02.826 --> 09:04.306
This is like in the fucking
apocalypse movies...

09:04.480 --> 09:05.568
Evan....where you could
take anything you want.

09:05.742 --> 09:06.917
Evan!

09:07.091 --> 09:08.528
Scuba.
Come on.

09:08.702 --> 09:10.138
You know what time it is, boys. Guys.

09:10.312 --> 09:11.356
Let's go. Fletcher...

09:11.531 --> 09:12.923
Oh, my God, here we go.

09:13.097 --> 09:14.098
to Dybing!
What happened
to stealth mission?

09:14.272 --> 09:15.491
Come on.

09:15.665 --> 09:17.798
The store will open
in ten minutes.

09:17.972 --> 09:20.757
- Fucking Christ!
- Just stay calm, take a breath.

09:20.931 --> 09:22.672
Everybody's gonna get
their Furbies, all right?

09:22.846 --> 09:24.761
Oh, yeah? Why the fuck did
they get in there first?

09:24.935 --> 09:27.155
- Who?
- This is fucking bullshit!

09:27.329 --> 09:29.549
They're getting dibs
on all the good shit.

09:29.723 --> 09:30.680
Oh, fuck me.

09:30.854 --> 09:32.203
Those are our fucking Furbies.

09:32.377 --> 09:33.204
Mitch, what the hell
are you doing?

09:33.378 --> 09:34.641
I didn't let them in.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.164
- You think I let them in?
- Come on, man.

09:36.338 --> 09:37.731
What are they doing
in there, man?

09:37.905 --> 09:39.863
You fucking better let us in
right fucking now.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.604
All right, everybody,
just stay calm please.

09:41.778 --> 09:43.693
Fuck you!
Just push back
and stay calm, everybody.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.739
- Doug, lock it up. Now.
- Yeah.

09:45.913 --> 09:48.698
Guys, nobody's getting in.

09:48.872 --> 09:50.352
We're locking the doors.

09:53.398 --> 09:55.183
Stay calm and back up!

09:55.357 --> 09:57.098
We need you to push back
a little bit.

09:57.272 --> 09:59.317
- Hold this for me.
- Fuck you, bitch. Hey, hey.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.972
- Hey, store's open, everyone.
- Hey, give me that.

10:02.146 --> 10:03.844
We need backup immediately!

10:04.018 --> 10:07.412
Step right up,
get your fucking waffle irons!

10:11.939 --> 10:12.896
Hold up.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.245
Manny, I need help!

10:17.292 --> 10:18.772
Oh, my God.

10:18.946 --> 10:20.338
- Dude.
- The fuck is happening?

10:20.512 --> 10:22.427
What the fuck is going on?

10:24.516 --> 10:26.910
Fuck this shit!

10:27.084 --> 10:29.739
Manny! Manny, help!
- Fuck!

10:29.913 --> 10:31.698
Where the fuck are you going?

10:33.525 --> 10:37.138
Hey, back the fuck up,
back the fuck up.

10:37.312 --> 10:39.183
Open the door. They're gonna
get crushed. Open it.

10:39.357 --> 10:41.011
You have to open the door.
You have to get to Mitch.

10:41.185 --> 10:42.665
Get Mitch, Doug.
You have to get to him.

10:42.839 --> 10:44.058
- Okay, yeah, I'll open it.
Oh, my God.

10:44.232 --> 10:45.712
Jess, Jess, call your dad.

10:45.886 --> 10:47.235
- Jess, call your dad right now.
- Give me your phone.

10:47.409 --> 10:48.932
- Yo, open the door!
- Give me your fucking phone.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.455
They're gonna get crushed.
Open the fucking door.

10:50.630 --> 10:51.456
- What are you doing?
- Open the fucking door!

10:51.631 --> 10:52.980
Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.

10:53.154 --> 10:54.198
Just gotta find the key.
Looking for the key.

10:54.372 --> 10:56.070
Open the door! Bobby?

10:56.244 --> 10:57.637
Open the fucking door.
Hold on, calm down.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.116
- What is wrong with you?
- Stop shoving.

10:59.290 --> 11:00.378
- Get off of me! Shit!
- Fuck off! Fuck off!

11:02.250 --> 11:04.382
Back the fuck up!
What the...?

11:06.515 --> 11:08.125
Oh, fuck, back the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

11:12.782 --> 11:14.784
- Go. Go.
- Oh, my God.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.921
Fucking move.

11:24.185 --> 11:26.535
Lonnie, grab it!

11:26.709 --> 11:28.624
Get off, that's my
fucking waffle iron!

11:31.192 --> 11:33.542
This is fucking gold.
This is fucking crazy.

11:33.716 --> 11:35.196
Gaby, wait...

11:35.370 --> 11:37.067
It's all right.
Jesus Christ.

11:41.376 --> 11:42.856
It's fucking insane!

11:43.030 --> 11:44.422
Evan, what the fuck?
You're gonna fucking die!

11:44.596 --> 11:46.250
- No, it's fine. Stay there.
- Get the fuck down!

11:46.424 --> 11:47.774
What the fuck?

11:47.948 --> 11:49.297
Evan! Evan!

11:49.471 --> 11:50.864
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Evan, get down!

11:52.474 --> 11:53.562
Fuck you!

12:01.265 --> 12:03.746
Got to be hundreds more
in the back!

12:09.665 --> 12:11.145
Move! Get the fuck
out of the way!

12:11.319 --> 12:13.495
Yulia! No. Move!
Get the fuck...

12:14.670 --> 12:15.627
Jess.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.717
He's alive.

12:17.891 --> 12:19.631
Hey! Hey, I'm coming!

12:19.806 --> 12:21.764
- No, Bobby. Bobby.
- Hey.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.724
- Hey!
- Bobby!

12:24.898 --> 12:27.161
Bobby! Bobby!

12:27.335 --> 12:28.945
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

12:41.001 --> 12:43.481
Fuck you! What the fuck?

12:43.655 --> 12:45.440
- You fuckstick!
- Stop it, stop it.

12:45.614 --> 12:47.050
You know,
you're a fucking Muppet!

12:47.224 --> 12:48.399
You Jim Henson motherfucker!

12:48.573 --> 12:50.010
Go back to Fraggle Rock!

12:50.184 --> 12:52.186
Nice jacket,
you Michael Jackson,

12:52.360 --> 12:54.536
you fucking pussy licker!

12:54.710 --> 12:55.755
Fuck you.

12:57.931 --> 13:00.760
Amanda! Amanda!

13:03.066 --> 13:05.373
No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:05.547 --> 13:07.114
No, no, no, no, no, Amanda, no.

13:07.288 --> 13:08.376
No.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.030
Amanda, look at me.

13:10.204 --> 13:12.032
Amanda.

13:12.206 --> 13:14.077
Somebody help me!

13:14.251 --> 13:15.818
Please help me!

13:17.733 --> 13:19.082
Oh, my God.

13:23.217 --> 13:25.828
Oh! Oh, fuck!

13:26.002 --> 13:27.525
Stop!

13:44.542 --> 13:46.762
Evan, get the fuck down!

13:46.936 --> 13:48.372
This is fucking gold.
- You suck!

13:48.546 --> 13:49.678
Evan, help me!

13:49.852 --> 13:51.419
Evan, help me! Get the...

13:51.593 --> 13:53.725
Oh, my God. Holy shit.
What the fuck?

13:53.900 --> 13:55.815
- That was crazy.
- Evan, get the fuck down.

13:55.989 --> 13:58.818
I've never fucking seen
something like this in my life.

14:09.132 --> 14:11.221
It's Thanksgiving,
not Thanksbuying!

14:11.395 --> 14:12.962
I'm live here at Right Mart

14:13.136 --> 14:15.051
and although
the store has announced

14:15.225 --> 14:17.749
they will have substantial
security upgrades

14:17.924 --> 14:19.664
for Thanksgiving,

14:19.839 --> 14:23.233
many residents feel after last
year's catastrophic events,

14:23.407 --> 14:26.062
the store shouldn't
be open at all.

14:26.236 --> 14:28.543
Thomas Wright,
you and your entire family

14:28.717 --> 14:29.979
have blood on your hands.

14:30.153 --> 14:32.025
My wife's blood.

14:32.199 --> 14:35.463
We open for Thanksgiving, you
only hire two security guards?

14:35.637 --> 14:37.944
One of whom runs away and
the other is trampled to death

14:38.118 --> 14:40.685
in the same stampede
that killed my wife.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.950
You and your entire family
need to go to prison.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.473
Not have another sale!

14:45.647 --> 14:47.170
Right Mart owner,
Thomas Wright,

14:47.344 --> 14:49.433
has worked overtime
since last year

14:49.607 --> 14:51.740
to give back to the community,

14:51.914 --> 14:54.917
restoring Plymouth Park
and even going so far

14:55.091 --> 14:57.180
as to start
the Wright Family Foundation,

14:57.354 --> 14:59.226
sending local kids to college.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.358
But many say it's not enough.

15:01.532 --> 15:03.926
Local pitching phenom
Bobby Di Stasi

15:04.100 --> 15:06.146
suffered a career-ending injury

15:06.320 --> 15:09.105
and has not been heard from
since the accident.

15:09.279 --> 15:12.108
Many lawsuits were filed
and settled,

15:12.282 --> 15:14.937
but the security cameras
somehow weren't working

15:15.111 --> 15:16.808
the night of the tragedy.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.159
All I know is the cameras
were functioning perfectly fine

15:19.333 --> 15:20.595
when I arrived.

15:20.769 --> 15:22.249
Then they mysteriously
stopped working

15:22.423 --> 15:24.555
the one night there's an actual
disaster at the store.

15:24.729 --> 15:26.079
How convenient.

15:26.253 --> 15:27.254
Thanks, Mitch.

15:27.428 --> 15:28.951
Reporting live, Hank Morton

15:29.125 --> 15:30.910
at the Right Mart
in downtown Plymouth.

15:31.084 --> 15:33.521
Chet, Natalie, back to you.

15:33.695 --> 15:35.871
And here you go.

15:36.045 --> 15:37.786
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

15:39.919 --> 15:42.399
Good morning, Sheriff.
You want the usual?

15:42.573 --> 15:45.185
Two cups today, Lizzie.
New deputy's coming.

15:45.359 --> 15:47.622
Oh, well,
he was in here yesterday

15:47.796 --> 15:50.930
and, uh, he's not much
for conversation.

15:51.104 --> 15:52.453
- Yeah.
- A real charmer.

15:52.627 --> 15:54.063
Probably just overwhelmed

15:54.237 --> 15:56.152
by the thriving metropolis
that is Plymouth.

15:56.326 --> 16:00.243
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, chills... ♪

16:04.117 --> 16:05.074
What the fuck?

16:05.248 --> 16:06.989
Fuck you.

16:10.514 --> 16:12.038
- This fish.
- It's organic.

16:12.212 --> 16:13.430
Oh, you know, all the lobsters
from the north...

16:13.604 --> 16:14.997
Here he is. Good morning.

16:15.171 --> 16:17.260
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Welcome.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.610
And here you are.

16:22.396 --> 16:23.875
It's John Carver.
He was the first...

16:24.050 --> 16:26.182
First governor
of New Plymouth colony.

16:26.356 --> 16:28.097
Look at you. You've been doing
your homework there, Labelle.

16:28.271 --> 16:30.404
Well, if you call reading
a plaque on a statue homework.

16:30.578 --> 16:32.797
Oh, now, come on,
show some enthusiasm.

16:32.972 --> 16:34.930
Thanksgiving
is an institution here.

16:35.104 --> 16:37.411
What kid wouldn't want
to wear that, right?

16:37.585 --> 16:39.891
Yeah, get used to it.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.806
Everybody's
gonna be wearing them.

16:43.939 --> 16:46.072
Yeah. I can get used to it.

16:46.246 --> 16:48.291
♪ But then I bury
the hatchet. ♪

16:49.597 --> 16:50.815
Yes!

16:52.382 --> 16:53.862
Let's go.

16:55.385 --> 16:56.691
What-what are you doing?

16:56.865 --> 16:57.953
Kid, what are you doing?

16:58.127 --> 16:59.476
I just hit top two rungs.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.435
That means you get to go again.

17:01.609 --> 17:03.176
Somebody keeps tagging me
in the video.

17:03.350 --> 17:04.960
Yeah, they're tagging me, too.

17:05.134 --> 17:06.657
God. I'm gonna report it.

17:06.831 --> 17:08.398
Yeah, but people
keep reposting it.

17:08.572 --> 17:09.791
You think someone's doing
it on purpose?

17:09.965 --> 17:11.271
Dude, I just won
this candy apple.

17:11.445 --> 17:12.794
I hit the bull's-eye
like three times in a row.

17:12.968 --> 17:14.535
Awesome.
Good job, babe.

17:14.709 --> 17:15.884
What?

17:16.058 --> 17:17.538
What is it?
What did I do now?

17:17.712 --> 17:18.974
Evan,
- get the fuck down!
- This.

17:19.148 --> 17:20.367
This is fucking gold.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.282
- I thought we were past this.
- Yeah, so did I.

17:22.456 --> 17:23.761
Well, fuck this.
I'm going back to the axe pit.

17:23.935 --> 17:24.762
It's safer there.

17:24.936 --> 17:26.460
Ev, I'm sorry.

17:26.634 --> 17:28.157
I wasn't the only one
with a phone that night.

17:28.331 --> 17:29.332
I know you didn't post it.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.899
Come on, come on.

17:31.073 --> 17:32.944
Ugh.
I have to go
to the John Carver house

17:33.119 --> 17:35.077
to film that stupid commercial
with my dad.

17:35.251 --> 17:37.253
I'm making
my grandmother's stuffing.

17:37.427 --> 17:40.300
Her secret ingredient
was a touch of eggplant.

17:40.474 --> 17:42.258
I only hope I can make it
half as good as hers, though.

17:42.432 --> 17:45.087
Oh, I'm sure you'll make
an excellent dinner, Kathleen.

17:45.261 --> 17:46.654
- Hey, Jessica.
- Hey.

17:46.828 --> 17:48.699
So, you ready for your
big moment in the limelight?

17:48.873 --> 17:51.093
Oh, yeah. Already wrote
my acceptance speech.

17:51.267 --> 17:53.748
Ah, I have mine ready, too.

17:53.922 --> 17:55.576
Yours?

17:55.750 --> 17:57.012
Didn't your father tell you?

17:57.186 --> 17:59.493
He wants a family commercial
this year.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.715
Look at it this way:
One more year until college.

18:04.889 --> 18:07.109
How am I supposed to have
an answer? I don't...

18:07.283 --> 18:09.677
I can't fucking believe this!

18:09.851 --> 18:11.505
I don't have an answer, Stan.
I have no idea

18:11.679 --> 18:12.897
- what in the hell just happened.
- Huh.

18:13.072 --> 18:14.508
Don't know what he's doing.

18:14.682 --> 18:16.727
It's now just
a complete disaster.

18:16.901 --> 18:19.339
- What's going on?
- You got to see this.

18:24.431 --> 18:26.911
This is a fucking disaster.

18:27.086 --> 18:28.565
The whole commercial's ruined.

18:28.739 --> 18:30.089
I've been screaming
at everybody the whole morning.

18:30.263 --> 18:32.526
Okay, guys, back up.
I got to call this in.

18:32.700 --> 18:33.962
Yeah, a historical landmark
has been trashed.

18:34.136 --> 18:35.224
What?

18:35.398 --> 18:36.530
Yeah, whatever.
That, too.

18:36.704 --> 18:37.748
I got to shut this place down.

18:37.922 --> 18:39.098
I catch these guys,

18:39.272 --> 18:40.447
I'm gonna prosecute them
for vandalism.

18:40.621 --> 18:42.275
Uh, yeah, and theft.

18:42.449 --> 18:44.277
Because there was an axe
on that wall I was gonna use.

18:44.451 --> 18:45.800
It's gone.

18:45.974 --> 18:48.107
Come to Right Mart,
where we slash prices...

18:48.281 --> 18:49.499
without a fucking axe!

18:49.673 --> 18:51.284
My commercial's ruined.

18:53.764 --> 18:55.070
You look relieved.

18:55.244 --> 18:56.854
Yeah.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.291
I'm tired of pretending

18:58.465 --> 19:01.337
like everything's normal
when it's not.

19:01.511 --> 19:04.253
Well, hey, Jess, I want things
to go back to normal, too.

19:04.427 --> 19:05.559
That's why this year's
gonna be everything

19:05.733 --> 19:07.038
last year was supposed to be.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.649
Dad...

19:08.823 --> 19:11.130
Having another sale
like nothing happened

19:11.304 --> 19:13.262
doesn't change anything.
It just ignores it.

19:15.003 --> 19:17.005
And as usual, we can't have
one moment alone.

19:18.963 --> 19:20.226
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:26.884 --> 19:28.625
I'm good. Very good.

19:30.497 --> 19:31.802
How are things going
with Jessica?

19:31.976 --> 19:33.500
Dude, they're amazing.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.024
She invited me to the parade
to be on the float,

19:36.198 --> 19:38.592
and then I scored an invite
to Thanksgiving dinner

19:38.766 --> 19:40.811
with her family at her house.
I feel like I'm in.

19:40.985 --> 19:43.118
Bobby ghosting her is the best
thing that ever happened to me.

19:43.292 --> 19:44.380
Nicely played.

19:46.077 --> 19:47.166
Is this good?

19:47.340 --> 19:50.212
♪ I know what boys like... ♪

19:50.386 --> 19:52.997
McCarty Party.
That is where you want to be.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.696
You look like you enjoy alcohol
and drinking,

19:55.870 --> 19:58.394
so you're gonna want to come
down to the McCarty party.

19:58.568 --> 20:00.918
25 whole dollars. Hey.

20:01.092 --> 20:02.311
You guys want tickets
to McCarty Party?

20:02.485 --> 20:03.617
I can do a group rate.

20:03.791 --> 20:05.140
- He's charging this year?
- Yeah.

20:05.314 --> 20:06.402
He's been watching
a lot of "Shark Tank."

20:06.576 --> 20:07.664
Dude thinks he's Mark Cuban.

20:07.838 --> 20:09.362
No, thank you.

20:09.536 --> 20:11.538
Selling alcohol to teens
isn't exactly disrupting.

20:11.712 --> 20:14.367
No, but it is
a recession-proof business.

20:14.541 --> 20:15.759
Let me know
if you guys want tickets.

20:15.933 --> 20:17.196
- They're selling out quick.
- How about you

20:17.370 --> 20:18.632
finish my fucking history paper,

20:18.806 --> 20:20.503
and then we'll talk tickets?

20:20.677 --> 20:22.810
- Sure.
You're an asshole.

20:22.984 --> 20:24.812
You're such... Be nicer to him.

20:24.986 --> 20:26.553
Listen, listen.
He's a sweetie.

20:26.727 --> 20:27.684
- Gabs.
I paid him

20:27.858 --> 20:29.599
a pretty decent sum of money.

20:29.773 --> 20:32.036
What? I can't write papers and
play football at the same time.

20:32.211 --> 20:33.124
- Are you kidding?
- It's Bobby.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.604
Oh, shit. He's back.

20:34.778 --> 20:37.651
Wait, why didn't he come talk
to you?

20:37.825 --> 20:39.783
I don't know. I haven't talked
to him in, like, a year.

20:39.957 --> 20:41.742
Yeah, that's definitely him.

20:43.047 --> 20:44.397
I don't think so.

20:44.571 --> 20:46.268
♪ I know what boys like ♪

20:46.442 --> 20:48.401
♪ I know what's
on their mind... ♪

20:48.575 --> 20:50.272
"The table is set"?

20:50.446 --> 20:51.665
This is weird.

20:51.839 --> 20:53.101
No, it's-it's a fake.

20:53.275 --> 20:54.929
- He has no followers.
Ooh, it's a table.

20:55.103 --> 20:56.278
We're all tagged.

20:58.672 --> 20:59.934
Mm, Ryan's here.

21:00.108 --> 21:01.588
Evan.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.067
Can you at least try and seem
like you're not a dick?

21:03.242 --> 21:04.025
I'm nice to him.

21:04.199 --> 21:05.374
Okay? Ryan's fine.

21:05.548 --> 21:06.636
He just...

21:06.810 --> 21:08.421
He's harmless, like an NPC.

21:08.595 --> 21:09.683
But...

21:09.857 --> 21:11.815
he messes with
the group dynamic.

21:11.989 --> 21:13.295
- Okay.
Just be nicer.

21:13.469 --> 21:14.775
- For me.
- Okay. I just have nothing

21:14.949 --> 21:16.298
to talk about with the guy.

21:16.472 --> 21:18.474
He's just, like...
He's kind of boring.

21:18.648 --> 21:19.997
Well, maybe if you made
a bit of an effort.

21:20.171 --> 21:21.434
I mean, he's a good guy.

21:21.608 --> 21:22.913
Good guy.

21:23.087 --> 21:25.307
Well, he hasn't just ghosted me
yet, so...

21:25.481 --> 21:27.570
he's frontrunner.

21:29.180 --> 21:30.138
NPC.

21:30.312 --> 21:31.226
- Hey.
- Walks like a robot.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.445
Talks like a robot.

21:32.619 --> 21:33.446
- What's up, everyone?
- Ryan!

21:33.620 --> 21:35.012
Hey!

21:35.186 --> 21:36.492
- How you doing?
- Hello!

21:36.666 --> 21:37.928
- Hi, Gab. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

21:38.102 --> 21:39.365
You finish your paper?

21:39.539 --> 21:41.018
Barely.

21:41.192 --> 21:42.890
I had to start another one
today, and I got...

21:43.064 --> 21:44.848
I'm gonna just... I'm gonna be
swamped until Christmas,

21:45.022 --> 21:46.241
let's just say that.

21:46.415 --> 21:47.373
That's crazy, bro.

21:48.678 --> 21:50.419
Oh, excuse me.
We're ready to order.

21:50.593 --> 21:52.595
This isn't Right Mart, honey.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.076
You actually have
to wait your turn here.

21:56.512 --> 21:57.861
Ooh, she told you.

21:58.035 --> 21:59.428
- Someone's in trouble.
- She told us.

21:59.602 --> 22:00.951
Uh, so, what-what are you guys

22:01.125 --> 22:02.866
doing
for the Pats-Steelers game?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.520
Probably watching at my place.

22:04.694 --> 22:06.174
That sounds fun.
You can totally do that.

22:06.348 --> 22:07.915
Or...

22:08.089 --> 22:10.657
you could watch it with me
on the 50-yard line.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.441
- Wait.
What's up? Yo.

22:12.615 --> 22:13.877
- Bro, are you serious?
- I swear. Hey...

22:14.051 --> 22:15.183
- Oh, my God.
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!

22:15.357 --> 22:16.706
Yes, sir.
- That's what's up.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.142
- Scuba, you know me.
- Jess, brownie points.

22:18.317 --> 22:19.405
-  Very sweet.
- I-I like this guy.

22:19.579 --> 22:20.406
This guy.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.981
All right.

22:31.155 --> 22:33.027
Are you shits ready to order?

22:33.201 --> 22:34.898
Yes. Uh, can I do
the vanilla frappe?

22:35.072 --> 22:36.509
All right. You want jimmies
on it?
Extra jimmies.

22:36.683 --> 22:38.249
Garlic knots for the table?

22:38.424 --> 22:40.774
Garlic knots.
- This isn't Papa Gino's, kids.

22:40.948 --> 22:42.558
Evan, get the fuck down!

22:42.732 --> 22:43.951
This is fucking gold.

24:33.626 --> 24:36.193
Fuck. No. No!

25:15.581 --> 25:17.887
Where are my fucking keys?

25:18.061 --> 25:22.239
Where are my fucking keys,
goddamn it?!

25:22.413 --> 25:23.502
Fuck.

25:23.676 --> 25:24.981
Fuck.

25:26.896 --> 25:28.158
Motherfucker!

25:35.122 --> 25:37.472
Watch out. Here we go.
Here we go. Watch out, sir.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.475
Oh, my God.

25:41.868 --> 25:45.175
Cover that body! Cover that up.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.595
Yo, Jacob.

26:13.769 --> 26:15.292
Step into my office.

26:15.466 --> 26:16.903
Uh-huh.

26:19.906 --> 26:20.950
What's with the shades?

26:21.124 --> 26:22.604
- I had a late night.
- Huh.

26:22.778 --> 26:23.692
What were you doing?

26:23.866 --> 26:26.521
Well, I had two essays to write.

26:26.695 --> 26:28.218
I'll hook you up next week.

26:28.392 --> 26:29.872
You said that last month.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.744
Yeah, Ms. Byers better
eat this shit up, okay?

26:31.918 --> 26:32.962
Trust me, Evan,
she couldn't have

26:33.136 --> 26:34.529
written it better herself.

26:34.703 --> 26:36.139
Okay.

26:36.313 --> 26:38.098
You're the man.

26:38.272 --> 26:39.882
- Mm. Yeah.
- Brainiac.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.188
Eat shit.

26:43.756 --> 26:45.322
Oh, fuck!

26:46.846 --> 26:49.892
Guys, John Carver
tagged us again.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.720
Oh, fuck.

26:51.894 --> 26:53.461
Look.

26:58.509 --> 27:00.686
Oh, my God.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.905
These seats are for us.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.342
Our names are at the table.

27:06.996 --> 27:08.476
Stay behind the line.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.260
Oh, Sheriff, what happened?
Is this killing connected

27:10.434 --> 27:11.827
to what happened at Right Mart?

27:12.001 --> 27:13.568
Can we get this pushed back
a little bit?

27:13.742 --> 27:16.571
Am I walking on anything?
What do you got for me?

27:16.745 --> 27:18.442
Guys are going through
security footage inside.

27:18.617 --> 27:19.835
- Inside?
- Sheriff.

27:20.009 --> 27:21.141
Sheriff, can you tell us anything...

27:21.315 --> 27:22.533
Can you get these guys
out of the way?

27:23.752 --> 27:25.101
Pete.

27:25.275 --> 27:27.364
We found this where
the killer broke in.

27:27.538 --> 27:29.105
What is this?

27:29.279 --> 27:30.759
I think it's brick.

27:30.933 --> 27:32.456
- Or pieces of brick.
- Right.

27:32.631 --> 27:34.154
Labelle, you've met
Detective Chu, yeah?

27:34.328 --> 27:35.895
Oh, yeah.

27:36.069 --> 27:37.679
Yeah, we met.

27:37.853 --> 27:39.463
Come take a look at this.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.423
Brick.

27:42.597 --> 27:44.338
We got the killer
on security cam,

27:44.512 --> 27:48.342
and you're not gonna believe
what he's wearing.

27:48.516 --> 27:50.561
Cameras at Right Mart
caught the same guy

27:50.736 --> 27:53.042
lowering her legs
onto the sign from the roof.

27:53.216 --> 27:54.696
It's just like you said, Sheriff.

27:54.870 --> 27:58.047
Everyone in town's
wearing them. Yeah.

27:58.221 --> 27:59.745
Jess, you know me.

27:59.919 --> 28:01.572
I will not be bullied
by some freaking lunatic.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.357
The store is staying open,
and I'm hiring extra security.

28:03.531 --> 28:06.099
But, honey, I need you to get to
the sheriff's office now.

28:06.273 --> 28:07.840
- I know. We're going now.
- Okay, but just ask anyone

28:08.014 --> 28:09.145
who was there that night
to go talk to them.

28:09.319 --> 28:11.844
- Okay, okay. Bye.
- I love you.

28:12.018 --> 28:13.584
He's hiring additional security.

28:13.759 --> 28:14.977
But not closing the store.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.849
Correct.
That would make sense.

28:17.023 --> 28:19.286
Wait. Wait,
are you serious?

28:19.460 --> 28:21.767
Did your dad not see
this guy tagged us?

28:21.941 --> 28:23.333
Is he waiting for us
to be on a fucking display

28:23.507 --> 28:25.248
- in front of his store?
- I'm asking him right now.

28:25.422 --> 28:26.772
- Why?
- Scuba, don't.

28:26.946 --> 28:28.556
Why the fuck not?
He gonna tag me,

28:28.730 --> 28:30.427
I'm gonna send that motherfucker
a DM. Come get me, bitch.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.038
Don't slide
into the killer's DMs.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.170
Scuba, please,
just hold off, okay?

28:34.344 --> 28:35.868
It's a murder case
in my dad's store.

28:36.042 --> 28:38.566
- We can't just fuck around.
- Fuck around and find out.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.655
Fuck around and find out.
That's right.

28:40.829 --> 28:41.787
He'll see
what happens.

28:47.401 --> 28:48.968
- Are you crazy, McCarty?
- Come on, princess.

28:49.142 --> 28:50.360
I wouldn't hit you.

28:50.534 --> 28:51.666
You know how much paperwork
the cops

28:51.840 --> 28:53.276
would make me fill out?

28:53.450 --> 28:54.713
McCarty, are you back
to finish tenth grade?

28:54.887 --> 28:56.149
I just thought, you know,

28:56.323 --> 28:57.759
in light of the current situation,

28:57.933 --> 28:59.674
you might want
a little "protection."

28:59.848 --> 29:01.284
Courtesy of my old man's store.

29:01.458 --> 29:02.851
McCarty, only you
would have the balls

29:03.025 --> 29:04.418
to sell guns
at a high school.

29:04.592 --> 29:06.159
I should kick your ass right here.

29:06.333 --> 29:07.813
Come on, Mark Cuban would
think I'm a fucking genius:

29:07.987 --> 29:10.598
Everyone gets a gun,
problem solved.

29:10.772 --> 29:13.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, Scooby snacks.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.559
Jesus, I'm only kidding.

29:15.734 --> 29:17.910
I wouldn't sell guns to kids.

29:18.084 --> 29:19.563
I'm selling alcohol.

29:19.738 --> 29:21.478
And right now I gotta meet
that little farthead Jacob

29:21.652 --> 29:23.437
to sell him some more
McCarty Party tickets.

29:23.611 --> 29:24.743
- All right, McCarty.
- Okay.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.266
Sales are going
through the roof.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.833
Fuck off, McCarty.
- No one's coming to that.

29:28.007 --> 29:29.530
You guys should comeYULIA: You're a creep.

29:29.704 --> 29:31.314
It's the only place in town
you won't get killed.

29:35.623 --> 29:38.321
I could really use
your help, Jessica.

29:40.062 --> 29:41.629
Uh, okay, what can I do?

29:41.803 --> 29:43.326
We've exhausted
pretty much every resource

29:43.500 --> 29:45.328
to identify people, but anyone

29:45.502 --> 29:48.723
involved with that night
could be in serious danger.

29:51.117 --> 29:53.206
I knew I shouldn't have
let them in the store.

29:55.469 --> 29:58.428
Detective, can you
give us a moment?
Yes.

29:58.602 --> 30:00.213
If you look closely,
you can see all our names.

30:00.387 --> 30:03.129
And-and then it's kind
of blurry, it says "Scuba."

30:04.739 --> 30:06.132
Why do they call you Scuba?

30:06.306 --> 30:08.917
My last name's Dybing.

30:09.091 --> 30:10.484
What's your first name?

30:10.658 --> 30:13.052
Claude.

30:13.226 --> 30:15.794
Yeah, Scuba's better.

30:15.968 --> 30:18.666
Jessica, you know,
I don't know what happened

30:18.840 --> 30:20.146
with those cameras last year,

30:20.320 --> 30:22.017
but at this point,
I don't care.

30:22.191 --> 30:26.282
Because I understand you're
in a difficult situation.

30:26.456 --> 30:29.416
But I know you want
to do the right thing.

30:29.590 --> 30:32.245
So if you know something,
anything that can help us

30:32.419 --> 30:34.247
with the information
on that night,

30:34.421 --> 30:36.597
I promise I'll keep it
between us.

30:39.121 --> 30:41.732
Because this is a matter
of life and death.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.396
Jess.

30:58.097 --> 30:59.620
Saw you at the Cap yesterday.

30:59.794 --> 31:01.578
No. I got in this morning.

31:03.493 --> 31:04.930
You working for your uncle
again?

31:05.104 --> 31:06.845
I'm helping out
while I'm in town.

31:08.847 --> 31:12.938
Well, I'm sure
I'll see you around.

31:13.112 --> 31:15.070
Hey, Jess, wait.

31:15.244 --> 31:16.724
I'm sorry.

31:18.682 --> 31:19.901
Can I walk with you?

31:26.995 --> 31:29.215
I mean, you ghosted me.

31:29.389 --> 31:30.564
You're off social media.

31:30.738 --> 31:31.870
You deleted every trace
of yourself.

31:32.044 --> 31:33.523
I ghosted everybody.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.308
Yeah, but I'm not everybody.
I was your girlfriend.

31:35.482 --> 31:37.658
I blamed you for
what happened to me,

31:37.832 --> 31:39.312
and instead of just
telling you about it,

31:39.486 --> 31:40.835
I vanished, like a dick.

31:41.009 --> 31:44.056
I feel so stupid now,
but I just...

31:44.230 --> 31:46.928
Bobby, I feel horrible.

31:47.102 --> 31:48.930
If I hadn't let you guys in... No, don't.

31:49.104 --> 31:52.542
Don't.
It-it was my decision.

31:52.716 --> 31:54.109
I could have
stayed outside.

31:55.676 --> 31:58.070
It's not your fault.

31:58.244 --> 32:00.115
How's your arm?

32:00.289 --> 32:02.030
I mean,
rehab's going great,

32:02.204 --> 32:04.946
so I might get back up to
full-speed pitching again.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.861
- Golden Arm.
- Yeah.

32:07.035 --> 32:08.907
That's good.
I'm happy to hear it.

32:11.822 --> 32:15.217
Hey. What is it?

32:15.391 --> 32:16.871
Nothing.

32:17.045 --> 32:20.048
You know, I'm still your friend.
You can trust me.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.922
That night,
after the trampling,

32:24.096 --> 32:26.446
Kathleen was in a panic,
ranting about

32:26.620 --> 32:28.578
bad publicity
and getting sued, and...

32:30.580 --> 32:34.019
she went into the security room
and deleted all the footage.

32:34.193 --> 32:35.629
She asked me not
to say anything,

32:35.803 --> 32:37.544
and I didn't stop her.

32:37.718 --> 32:39.502
There's nothing you can
do about it now, so...

32:39.676 --> 32:41.722
That's the thing.
Maybe there is.

32:41.896 --> 32:43.985
Look, there's a backup system
at my house

32:44.159 --> 32:45.160
in my dad's office.

32:45.334 --> 32:47.293
Jess, that's probably long gone.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.164
No, it stores the footage
for a year.

32:49.338 --> 32:50.949
Then tell your dad you need it,
and then,

32:51.123 --> 32:52.167
given the circumstances,

32:52.341 --> 32:53.212
he prob... No, no, no, no.

32:53.386 --> 32:54.604
With the lawsuits, no way.

32:54.778 --> 32:56.302
He's pretending like
it doesn't exist.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.304
Well, what do you want to do?

32:58.478 --> 33:00.349
I want to see what's on it.

33:03.265 --> 33:04.179
Thanks for talking.

33:04.353 --> 33:06.138
Yeah. It was really nice.

33:06.312 --> 33:08.575
Oh, no, don't turn around.
It's Ryan Baker.

33:08.749 --> 33:10.229
I'll get rid of him.

33:10.403 --> 33:12.187
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

33:12.361 --> 33:14.755
- How you doing? All right?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

33:14.929 --> 33:16.626
Did you, um,
give your statement?

33:16.800 --> 33:18.411
Yeah, I did, but they were
just looking to

33:18.585 --> 33:20.239
identify people, and I didn't
know anybody except Scott,

33:20.413 --> 33:23.938
so I didn't have much
to offer.

33:24.112 --> 33:25.200
How you doing,
Bobby?

33:26.941 --> 33:28.769
Well, I'm sorry to
break up this reunion,

33:28.943 --> 33:32.294
but, uh, Bobby, could I see you
in my office?

33:32.468 --> 33:33.774
This is new.

33:33.948 --> 33:36.820
Yep. A lot's changed
since you left.

33:36.995 --> 33:38.257
Looks like it.

33:39.606 --> 33:41.086
All right,
let's get out of here.

33:45.264 --> 33:46.743
Still no suspects

33:46.917 --> 33:49.746
in the brutal murder of
local waitress Lizzie McMullan.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.532
Authorities have no clues
other than cryptic

33:52.706 --> 33:54.186
social media posts,

33:54.360 --> 33:56.188
leaving many residents to wonder

33:56.362 --> 33:59.930
who will be the next victim
of John Carver.

34:04.413 --> 34:07.199
Hey, Dewey.

34:07.373 --> 34:09.679
Hey, buddy, Daddy's going
on a little vacation.

34:09.853 --> 34:11.768
All right? Going down to
the Dominican Republic,

34:11.942 --> 34:13.379
and Gina's gonna
come down her, all right.

34:13.553 --> 34:15.772
You just chill, buddy.

34:15.946 --> 34:17.644
Who the fuck is...

34:17.818 --> 34:19.341
Hey. Yeah.

34:19.515 --> 34:21.604
- I'm waiting.
- Yeah, man, I see you.

34:21.778 --> 34:23.302
I got a fucking flight.
I'll be there in a minute.

34:23.476 --> 34:25.260
All right?

34:25.434 --> 34:26.653
Jesus.

34:26.827 --> 34:28.524
All right, buddy.

34:38.012 --> 34:39.187
Fuck.

34:47.935 --> 34:50.329
Fuckin' passport.

34:53.506 --> 34:54.507
Fuck.

34:57.423 --> 34:58.728
Fuck.

35:01.470 --> 35:03.951
Jesus fucking Christ.

35:31.674 --> 35:33.459
Fuck.

35:45.079 --> 35:47.125
Show yourself!

35:47.299 --> 35:48.778
I'm a security guard.

35:48.952 --> 35:51.303
I kill people every fucking day!

35:56.351 --> 35:58.484
Hey, I'm not scared
of you, buddy.

35:59.441 --> 36:00.877
Don't fuck with me!

36:05.360 --> 36:07.362
Let's fuckin' go!

36:09.103 --> 36:12.802
Dewey. Dewey where is he?
Where is he?

36:12.976 --> 36:15.283
Tell Daddy where he is, Dewey.

36:16.415 --> 36:18.460
Is he that way?

37:17.084 --> 37:18.477
Night, Mom.

38:09.963 --> 38:12.095
CHU [VOICE-OVER]:
Our killer has claimed
a second victim.

38:12.270 --> 38:13.967
He's brazen, confident.

38:14.141 --> 38:16.230
He's spent a considerable
amount of time and energy

38:16.404 --> 38:18.363
setting this up, but none
of this works unless he has

38:18.537 --> 38:19.973
a private location where
he's taking the victims.

38:20.147 --> 38:22.149
He's powering off his phone

38:22.323 --> 38:23.324
so we can't track him
on the move.

38:23.498 --> 38:24.934
He's taking the picture

38:25.108 --> 38:27.241
and then uploading it
from another location.

38:27.415 --> 38:29.025
We have one bit of physical
evidence that leads us

38:29.199 --> 38:30.418
to Cordage Park.

38:31.593 --> 38:32.725
Effective immediately,

38:32.899 --> 38:34.857
we're searching
every inch of it.

39:21.469 --> 39:23.906
Hey.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.648
- I was just using your computer.
- Oh, it's fine. Listen...

39:28.650 --> 39:31.087
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

39:31.261 --> 39:33.873
You know, after Mom died,

39:34.047 --> 39:37.877
the only thing that I
could do to survive was work.

39:38.051 --> 39:39.705
Because it's all I know.

39:39.879 --> 39:42.055
But work...

39:42.229 --> 39:44.057
doesn't fill the void.

39:44.231 --> 39:46.451
So, when I met Kathleen,

39:46.625 --> 39:48.844
I felt alive again.
I was...

39:49.018 --> 39:51.281
willing to just
overlook all flaws

39:51.456 --> 39:53.501
and it might've...

39:53.675 --> 39:55.068
been at your expense.

39:56.330 --> 39:58.114
And I just want to say...

39:59.768 --> 40:00.856
I'm sorry.

40:03.903 --> 40:04.860
Thank you.

40:06.601 --> 40:07.776
Love you, Dad.

40:07.950 --> 40:09.343
Love you.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.696
You find anything?

40:14.870 --> 40:16.524
Yeah. Let's go.

40:16.698 --> 40:17.699
Wait, what is it?

40:17.873 --> 40:19.571
Nothing. Let's just go.

40:24.532 --> 40:25.664
I know this kid.

40:25.838 --> 40:27.230
Lionel. He goes to our school.

40:27.405 --> 40:29.189
He's always the turkey
in the parade.

40:29.363 --> 40:31.104
And I-I know that guy.

40:31.278 --> 40:32.671
He goes to Hanover South.

40:32.845 --> 40:34.150
- Evan punched him, remember?
Yeah,

40:34.324 --> 40:35.674
he's the one
who started the riot.

40:35.848 --> 40:37.197
He had the bullhorn.

40:37.371 --> 40:38.677
I think his name is...

40:38.851 --> 40:40.940
Larry? Or Lonnie?

40:41.114 --> 40:42.332
Or-Or something.

40:42.507 --> 40:44.291
And she's probably
a cheerleader.

40:44.465 --> 40:47.163
That's great, Bobby. Thank you.

40:47.337 --> 40:48.730
Yeah.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.517
Hey, w-what is it?

40:54.562 --> 40:56.346
There's one more.

41:04.224 --> 41:05.834
That's Ryan Baker.

41:06.008 --> 41:09.272
He didn't know anyone
other than his roommate, huh?

41:09.447 --> 41:10.796
And that's Doug.

41:10.970 --> 41:12.667
The guard that got
crushed to death.

41:12.841 --> 41:15.931
Jessica, did Ryan ever mention
to you that he knew Doug?

41:16.105 --> 41:19.282
Because that certainly
wasn't in his statement.

41:19.457 --> 41:20.458
No.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.069
Yeah.

41:23.243 --> 41:25.332
There may not be anything to it.

41:27.029 --> 41:29.075
Be careful who you trust.
Both of you.

41:29.249 --> 41:30.598
Yeah, don't worry.

41:30.772 --> 41:31.991
I'll take care of Ryan today.

41:32.165 --> 41:33.253
You're not taking care
of anything.

41:33.427 --> 41:34.384
He just said
it could be nothing.

41:34.559 --> 41:36.082
All right, fine, Jess.

41:36.256 --> 41:38.476
If I see Ryan, I'll act
like nothing's weird.

41:38.650 --> 41:39.694
For you.

41:41.522 --> 41:43.002
You should get back to school.

41:43.176 --> 41:44.612
But stay alert.

41:44.786 --> 41:46.745
That's why I won't be
celebrating Thanksgiving

41:46.919 --> 41:49.225
this year or any year.

41:50.923 --> 41:53.534
- You're so brave.
- So brave.

41:53.708 --> 41:54.927
Thank you, Chad.

41:55.101 --> 41:57.277
That was very inspiring.

41:58.844 --> 42:00.672
Next up...

42:02.456 --> 42:03.413
Mr. Fletcher.

42:03.588 --> 42:04.806
Let's go, Fletcher.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.852
All right.

42:09.115 --> 42:10.333
Um...

42:10.508 --> 42:12.901
the piece that I have written...

42:13.075 --> 42:16.209
uh, is titled "The Wampanoag

42:16.383 --> 42:18.777
and the Native American Side
of Thanksgiving,"

42:18.951 --> 42:20.518
by Evan Fletcher.

42:21.736 --> 42:23.042
"While today Thanksgiving

42:23.216 --> 42:25.827
"is one of our nation's
favorite holidays,

42:26.001 --> 42:27.307
"it has a very different meaning

42:27.481 --> 42:29.222
"for many Native Americans.

42:29.396 --> 42:30.919
"For the Wampanoag,

42:31.093 --> 42:33.008
Thanksgiving is a day
of mourning."

42:35.968 --> 42:38.361
That was beautiful, Evan.

42:38.536 --> 42:40.276
I enjoyed hearing you read it.

42:42.278 --> 42:45.499
As much as I enjoyed
writing it for my blog.

43:01.863 --> 43:03.212
I'm gonna kill
that little asswipe.

43:03.386 --> 43:04.779
If it makes you feel
any better, you'll probably

43:04.953 --> 43:06.433
be killed before you get
suspended for plagiarism.

43:06.607 --> 43:08.740
Scuba. Don't even joke
about that.

43:08.914 --> 43:11.133
Yeah, my bad, you're right.
Plagiarism's serious.

43:13.179 --> 43:14.702
When did you talk to him last?

43:14.876 --> 43:16.443
Two days ago.
Was there a reason?

43:16.617 --> 43:18.488
Yeah, there's a reason.

43:18.663 --> 43:20.273
I never bought Ryan's
Mr. Perfect routine.

43:20.447 --> 43:22.449
Yeah, I mean, how would he
know a random security guard

43:22.623 --> 43:24.103
and why would he not
tell anybody?

43:24.277 --> 43:25.670
I don't know.

43:25.844 --> 43:27.672
Doug just moved here.
He was the new guy.

43:27.846 --> 43:29.369
This guy have any family
in Plymouth?

43:29.543 --> 43:30.979
I think his family's
in Nebraska.

43:31.153 --> 43:32.981
I-I don't believe
for a second it was Ryan.

43:33.155 --> 43:34.679
Doesn't make sense.
He's too nice.

43:34.853 --> 43:36.289
Okay,
let's not be naive here.

43:36.463 --> 43:38.421
I mean, the nicest guys
are the most psycho,

43:38.596 --> 43:39.727
they're just better
at hiding it.

43:43.688 --> 43:45.385
- God, what is wrong with me?
It's not you.

43:45.559 --> 43:46.691
Nothing wrong with you, Jess.

43:46.865 --> 43:48.606
I feel like I can't
trust anybody.

43:48.780 --> 43:50.303
You're probably right.

43:50.477 --> 43:52.000
I mean, us.

43:52.174 --> 43:53.088
It's all we got right now.

43:53.262 --> 43:55.047
And, yes, I am excluding Bobby.

43:55.221 --> 43:57.615
Bobby?
Wh... Bobby would never.

43:57.789 --> 43:59.312
I told you, he was doing great.

43:59.486 --> 44:01.140
No, you told us he told you
he was doing great.

44:01.314 --> 44:02.489
That's different
than he's doing great.

44:02.663 --> 44:04.143
For all we know,
he's not even at school,

44:04.317 --> 44:05.710
and he's driving around
in that tow truck full time.

44:05.884 --> 44:07.581
Wait, hey, hey. Why are we
even talking about them?

44:07.755 --> 44:10.323
It's got to be Mitch. I mean,
he's obsessed with the store,

44:10.497 --> 44:12.238
his wife just died,
and he hates us.

44:12.412 --> 44:14.501
That's right! Yo, that guy's
up to his eyeballs in motive.

44:14.675 --> 44:16.155
And he drives a van:

44:16.329 --> 44:17.939
the official transportation
choice for pedophiles,

44:18.113 --> 44:19.637
kidnappers, rapists, murderers...

44:19.811 --> 44:20.812
Yep, yep, you're right,
you're right. Scuba.

44:20.986 --> 44:22.378
Like Coach Ingalls says,

44:22.552 --> 44:24.206
the best defense
is a good offense.

44:24.380 --> 44:25.643
Me and you, we go after them,

44:25.817 --> 44:27.557
- fuck them up one by one.
- Let's go, let's go.

44:27.732 --> 44:29.385
And we'll get some, we'll get
some help from McCarty's store.

44:29.559 --> 44:32.040
Guys. Evan. Babe.
This is not a game, okay?

44:32.214 --> 44:33.912
These are not some Hanover kids.

44:37.045 --> 44:39.613
Can we just let the police
handle it, Ev?

44:41.571 --> 44:43.791
We're in deep shit here.

44:43.965 --> 44:47.708
We let the police handle it,
we're all gonna end up 50% off.

44:52.844 --> 44:54.628
Are you gonna answer it?

44:54.802 --> 44:56.543
No.

45:08.511 --> 45:09.948
This fits.

45:10.122 --> 45:11.514
You're on the Right Mart
"Mayflower"?

45:11.689 --> 45:13.212
Yep.

45:13.386 --> 45:14.387
Next.

45:25.267 --> 45:26.878
Bobby boy.

45:27.052 --> 45:29.054
Forgotten, but not gone.

45:29.228 --> 45:31.317
Forgotten?

45:31.491 --> 45:32.797
It feels like I never left.

45:34.712 --> 45:35.713
You in the parade now?

45:35.887 --> 45:36.931
Yeah, Jess asked me.

45:38.019 --> 45:39.238
Newlon was right, you know.

45:39.412 --> 45:40.892
A lot has changed
since you left.

45:41.066 --> 45:43.111
Ah, maybe not as much
as you think.

45:43.285 --> 45:45.026
What's that supposed to mean?

45:45.200 --> 45:48.464
Oh, no, I just mean that I'm
helping with the parade again.

45:48.638 --> 45:50.075
Hmm.

45:50.249 --> 45:52.033
You know, if you weren't
leaving in a few days,

45:52.207 --> 45:54.035
I would knock your teeth out.

45:54.209 --> 45:55.602
Whoa, leaving?

45:55.776 --> 45:56.690
Buddy...

45:58.605 --> 46:00.607
Who says I'm leaving?

46:07.745 --> 46:09.355
You fucking pussy.

46:09.529 --> 46:11.270
You fucking want it.
Let's fucking go.

One more. One more!

46:12.924 --> 46:16.362
There you fucking go! Nice!

46:16.536 --> 46:18.320
The fuck's going on here?

46:18.494 --> 46:20.148
Come on, Hanover.

46:20.322 --> 46:21.846
We gonna carve up Plymouth
like a turkey tomorrow or what?

46:22.020 --> 46:24.500
Let's go! Harder!

46:24.674 --> 46:26.024
Harder! One more time!

46:26.198 --> 46:28.983
Fuck yeah!
Looking good, cover girl.

46:29.157 --> 46:32.204
Nice. Nice. Nice form, there.

Just a little tease.

Fucking cancelled?

48:02.903 --> 48:03.861
- What the fuck?
- Relax.

48:04.035 --> 48:05.471
You can't cancel my game!

48:05.645 --> 48:07.690
You heard the man.
Let's go, Fletcher.

48:07.865 --> 48:09.431
Game's getting rescheduled.
Let's get changed.

48:09.605 --> 48:10.693
Rescheduled until when?
Until when?

48:10.868 --> 48:12.478
- June?
- Someone's missing.

48:12.652 --> 48:13.871
I'm gonna be fucking
graduated by then, bro!

48:14.045 --> 48:14.872
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go play,

48:15.046 --> 48:16.395
that's what I'm gonna do!

48:16.569 --> 48:18.092
Dude, you can't play
football alone, dumbass.

48:18.266 --> 48:19.615
Watch me!

48:23.402 --> 48:24.751
Blunderbuss!

48:24.925 --> 48:26.448
McCarty, what the fuck
are you doing?

48:26.622 --> 48:28.668
I was just gonna fire it off
if they won the game.

48:28.842 --> 48:30.148
It's just fucking gunpowder,
it's all right.

48:30.322 --> 48:33.194
Sorry, Sheriff.
My kid's a fucking idiot.

48:33.368 --> 48:35.501
- He's a fucking goober chucker.
- McCARTY'S DAD: Get in the car,

48:35.675 --> 48:36.850
- you fucking idiot.
- God, I hate those things.

48:37.024 --> 48:38.156
I can't even smell the powder.

48:38.330 --> 48:40.288
First commercial
my dad made me do,

48:40.462 --> 48:41.637
he took it so seriously

48:41.811 --> 48:42.987
he insisted I learn
how to pack it.

48:43.161 --> 48:44.292
He made me do it
over and over again.

48:44.466 --> 48:45.859
Almost blew up in my hand.

48:46.033 --> 48:47.513
Jess, you should go home.

48:47.687 --> 48:49.776
Gaby, maybe go find Evan,
get him out of here.

48:49.950 --> 48:51.996
I heard they found blood.

48:52.170 --> 48:53.562
Yeah.

48:53.736 --> 48:55.434
The people missing
were at the Right Mart.

48:55.608 --> 48:57.915
You stay together,
or at least in pairs, okay?

48:58.089 --> 48:59.960
- Okay, yeah.
- Shit.

49:00.134 --> 49:02.528
- I'll go get him.
- Okay, I'll meet you inside.

49:18.718 --> 49:20.633
Hey, I can leave, you guys.

49:20.807 --> 49:22.635
Oh, no, no, no.
Let's go back together.

49:22.809 --> 49:24.028
Hmm? We'll be right back.

49:24.202 --> 49:25.551
Yeah, wait up.
- Okay.

49:31.774 --> 49:33.124
Okay.

50:03.545 --> 50:04.459
That's weird.

50:47.589 --> 50:49.156
Gabs.

50:51.898 --> 50:53.073
Gaby?

51:03.779 --> 51:04.998
Gaby?

53:47.900 --> 53:49.075
Help! Help!

53:49.249 --> 53:50.337
He's in there! Please help!

53:50.511 --> 53:53.079
Help! Help!

53:53.253 --> 53:54.907
Please help!

54:04.395 --> 54:07.180
Did you notice
anything about him?

54:07.354 --> 54:08.964
Um...

54:09.138 --> 54:12.054
He was dressed as a pilgrim.

54:12.229 --> 54:14.753
And-and he had
a John Carver mask on.

54:14.927 --> 54:17.799
Okay. Just think.
It's about the details.

54:17.973 --> 54:19.366
Small mistakes,

54:19.540 --> 54:21.063
that's how they get caught.

54:21.238 --> 54:22.500
I'm sorry, I...

54:22.674 --> 54:24.589
I only saw him
for a few seconds.

54:24.763 --> 54:26.243
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay. Don't be sorry.

54:26.417 --> 54:28.114
- Okay.
- Okay, we're gonna get you home.

54:28.288 --> 54:29.942
- You're doing great.
- Okay.

54:30.116 --> 54:31.422
Thank you. All right.

54:31.596 --> 54:32.771
- You guys good?
- Yeah.

54:32.945 --> 54:34.642
We got to get you guys
home soon, okay?

54:34.816 --> 54:36.035
Get out of here.

54:38.124 --> 54:39.386
Hey, Bobby's coming.

54:39.560 --> 54:41.997
Hey, is she...? Hey.

54:42.171 --> 54:44.826
Are you okay?
Here, here, here.

54:45.000 --> 54:45.871
Thanks.

54:46.045 --> 54:48.439
That's my girlfriend. Jess.

54:48.613 --> 54:50.745
- He came right for me.
- Did you see him?

54:50.919 --> 54:52.399
- Hi.
You okay?

54:52.573 --> 54:54.749
Yeah. Yeah.

54:54.923 --> 54:56.838
He came after me,
but I got away.

54:57.012 --> 54:58.971
Douche.

54:59.145 --> 55:01.234
That's been happening
a lot here recently.

55:01.408 --> 55:02.888
I wonder why.

55:03.062 --> 55:05.064
Okay, you want to tell us
about your little buddy,

55:05.238 --> 55:06.457
the security guard?

55:08.067 --> 55:10.287
- I'm sorry, who?
- Dude, stop lying to her, man.

55:10.461 --> 55:12.463
Just like how
you lied to the cops.

55:12.637 --> 55:13.986
Going to the corner,
huddled together?

55:14.160 --> 55:15.857
I'm sorry, are you talking
about the security guard

55:16.031 --> 55:17.729
from-from Right Mart? Doug?

55:17.903 --> 55:19.557
We have proof.
It's on video, dude.

55:19.731 --> 55:21.385
You are a fucking idiot, man.

55:21.559 --> 55:22.951
I honestly hope
you make a better pitcher

55:23.125 --> 55:24.039
than you do a detective.

55:24.213 --> 55:25.650
No, I walked off with him

55:25.824 --> 55:27.304
because we were getting addies.

55:27.478 --> 55:29.218
That's why Scott was there.

55:29.393 --> 55:32.134
I was just bro-ing up with him
'cause I needed another hookup.

55:32.309 --> 55:34.833
Adderall?"Adderall?"

55:35.007 --> 55:35.964
Yes, Adderall.

55:36.138 --> 55:37.749
That is what smart kids do,

55:37.923 --> 55:40.012
so we can get into Ivy League
schools, and guys like you

55:40.186 --> 55:41.622
- can tow our Porsches.
- Get your...

55:41.796 --> 55:43.320
- Bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey.

55:43.494 --> 55:44.669
- Yo, what the fuck?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

55:44.843 --> 55:45.757
- Get the fuck off.
- Ryan!

55:45.931 --> 55:47.062
Get home, both of you.

55:47.236 --> 55:48.107
I didn't... And stay the fuck away

55:48.281 --> 55:49.413
from the parade tomorrow.

55:49.587 --> 55:50.457
I see either one of you
on the street,

55:50.631 --> 55:51.980
I'm gonna haul you both in.

55:52.154 --> 55:53.591
- Jess, I'm not the bad guy here.
- Go.

55:53.765 --> 55:54.983
He came at me.
- This isn't done.

55:55.157 --> 55:56.420
- He just, he just came at me.
- No. Stop!

55:56.594 --> 55:58.030
Stop!

55:58.204 --> 55:59.945
I can't believe you two.

56:00.119 --> 56:01.425
My friends could be dead,

56:01.599 --> 56:03.296
and you can't put
your bullshit aside?

56:03.470 --> 56:05.124
I don't want to see
either of you.

56:05.298 --> 56:06.908
Okay?

56:07.082 --> 56:08.257
- Get out.
- Jess, that is not what...

56:08.432 --> 56:09.737
Get out!

56:12.174 --> 56:13.480
Shit. It's my dad.

56:14.742 --> 56:15.743
Yulia.

56:16.918 --> 56:18.050
Yulia, come.

56:18.224 --> 56:20.400
I... I...

56:20.574 --> 56:21.662
Papa.
Get in.

56:21.836 --> 56:23.142
What are you doing? Pop.

56:23.316 --> 56:24.970
Get in the Mercedes.[SPEAKS RUSSIAN] Dad!

56:25.144 --> 56:27.407
- Just tell me where we're going.
- Florida.

56:31.585 --> 56:33.195
He's just taking her
to Florida?

56:33.370 --> 56:34.545
I don't know.

56:34.719 --> 56:36.111
That's about as much
of a conversation

56:36.285 --> 56:38.592
I've ever had with the guy.

56:40.464 --> 56:41.682
What?

56:41.856 --> 56:43.118
Evan's right.

56:43.292 --> 56:45.730
The police ain't doing shit.
Let's go.

56:45.904 --> 56:47.209
Where are we going?

56:50.604 --> 56:53.781
Ladies and gentlemen,
another satisfied customer.

56:53.955 --> 56:56.088
Jacob, get him a T-shirt.

56:57.437 --> 56:59.308
Here you go, buddy.
On the house.

57:02.703 --> 57:04.705
Hey, listen, I just
want to know if it's worth it

57:04.879 --> 57:06.881
before we pay.

57:07.055 --> 57:09.449
I mean, I heard this party
isn't even all that, so...

57:09.623 --> 57:12.670
Listen, kid.

57:12.844 --> 57:14.976
Sometimes things end up much
better than you'd expect,

57:15.150 --> 57:16.413
all right?

57:16.587 --> 57:18.153
Think of it this way,

57:18.327 --> 57:20.373
when Black Sabbath
fired Ozzy in '79,

57:20.547 --> 57:21.766
you would've figured
it was all fucking over.

57:21.940 --> 57:23.289
The end of an era.

57:23.463 --> 57:28.120
But then, along comes
Ronnie James Dio,

57:28.294 --> 57:31.645
all five foot nothing of him,
the evil little elf,

57:31.819 --> 57:33.560
and he brought a magic
to that band

57:33.734 --> 57:35.344
that they hadn't seen in years.

57:36.258 --> 57:37.564
Who's Black Sabbath?

57:38.739 --> 57:40.045
Get the fuck off my property.

57:40.219 --> 57:41.655
I just want to know.
Who's Black...

57:41.829 --> 57:43.570
Get the fuck off
my property right now.

57:43.744 --> 57:45.093
Go back to Methuen,
you fucking dorks.

57:45.267 --> 57:47.313
- Fuck you.
- No virgins allowed.

57:47.487 --> 57:49.446
Cocksucker.

57:50.838 --> 57:52.840
Jacob. VIP. Upstairs. Now.

57:53.014 --> 57:53.885
All right.

57:55.887 --> 57:59.064
♪ Will he survive, will he
survive, will he survive ♪

57:59.238 --> 58:01.066
♪ Will he survive the sword? ♪

58:01.240 --> 58:03.329
Watch out, this kid's
been here for two days.

58:03.503 --> 58:04.939
Drank too much white zinfandel.

58:08.247 --> 58:09.335
Welcome to the Death Star.

58:09.509 --> 58:11.163
This is where the magic happens.

58:11.337 --> 58:13.687
- Jacob, VIP's closed.
Yeah.

58:13.861 --> 58:15.254
You're on door patrol.

58:18.431 --> 58:21.216
You get caught with any of
this shit, you're on your own.

58:23.697 --> 58:26.091
- Jesus, Scuba.
- What about this?

58:26.265 --> 58:27.919
That's mainly for taking down
angry grizzlies

58:28.093 --> 58:30.051
in the Alaskan wilderness
or brain-eating zombies

58:30.225 --> 58:32.967
in a post-apocalyptic America.

58:33.141 --> 58:34.621
All right.

58:34.795 --> 58:36.797
Let me show you something
far more reasonable.

58:41.410 --> 58:44.109
...44 Magnum. A classic.

58:44.283 --> 58:45.806
Plus, you get bonus points
if you make

58:45.980 --> 58:47.329
a Dirty Harry-style comment
when you blast him.

58:47.504 --> 58:50.332
Mc-McCarty, do you have
any human-sized guns?

58:50.507 --> 58:51.899
Maybe.

59:00.517 --> 59:01.518
All right.

59:01.692 --> 59:04.129
The SIG 226.

59:04.303 --> 59:07.219
It's a short recoil-operated,
locked breech pistol.

59:07.393 --> 59:09.830
Decent stopping power.

59:10.004 --> 59:11.528
You'll want to use this.

59:11.702 --> 59:13.138
Keep the safety on,

59:13.312 --> 59:15.096
unless you want
to blow your nuts off.

59:15.270 --> 59:16.750
What about you, Right Mart?

59:16.924 --> 59:19.579
Uh, I fired a musket once.
It almost killed me.

59:19.753 --> 59:21.189
Yeah, those things are fucked.

59:21.363 --> 59:23.278
Let me show you something.

59:25.063 --> 59:26.891
Check this out.

59:27.065 --> 59:28.545
Element of surprise, huh?

59:28.719 --> 59:29.807
Pull it out of your belt

59:29.981 --> 59:31.243
and you stick 'em
right in the gut.

59:31.417 --> 59:32.505
We got all sorts
of tactical shit.

59:32.679 --> 59:33.985
It's yours if you want it.

59:34.159 --> 59:35.943
Um, I'm-I'm good.

59:36.117 --> 59:38.119
Scuba will be with me,
and he's armed, so...

59:38.293 --> 59:39.904
All right.

59:42.733 --> 59:45.344
McCarty, I owe you one.

59:45.518 --> 59:48.129
Yeah. Anytime.

59:48.303 --> 59:49.914
All right. Thanks.

59:50.088 --> 59:51.916
Yeah.

59:52.090 --> 59:53.700
Scuba. Jess.

59:53.874 --> 59:55.702
Be careful out there, huh?

59:55.876 --> 59:58.487
Keep yourself alive long enough
to return that thing.

01:00:00.881 --> 01:00:02.491
I don't know what you think

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:04.015
- you're gonna do with a gun.
- It's for protection, baby.

01:00:04.189 --> 01:00:05.625
You've never even
held one before.

01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:07.235
You've never seen one before.

01:00:07.409 --> 01:00:09.368
If you really want someone
to come and help,

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:11.500
I'm sure my dad can, like,
call the sheriff's department

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:13.372
and send a cop over.
There's one here right now.

01:00:13.546 --> 01:00:14.721
Hey, can I come by?

01:00:14.895 --> 01:00:16.375
Um, okay, I'm packing right now

01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:19.030
'cause I'm going to Florida,
apparently, so...

01:00:19.204 --> 01:00:20.901
Okay, I don't know
when I'll be back,

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:22.816
but I'm a little stressed, okay?

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.165
I'll call you back later.

01:00:24.339 --> 01:00:25.819
Okay. Call me from the car.

01:00:25.993 --> 01:00:27.516
Geez.

01:00:28.605 --> 01:00:31.259
For you. Enjoy.

01:00:31.433 --> 01:00:33.174
Thank you. You sure?

01:00:33.348 --> 01:00:35.524
Eat it.
We are going to Florida.

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.049
Appreciate it.

01:00:38.223 --> 01:00:40.965
When's the, uh,
the remodel done?

01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:42.836
Never.

01:00:59.897 --> 01:01:00.811
Dad?

01:01:07.774 --> 01:01:09.080
Dad?

01:01:20.091 --> 01:01:21.266
Dad?

01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:42.940
Dad!

01:01:44.376 --> 01:01:45.725
Jesus, Dad.

01:01:45.899 --> 01:01:47.031
What the hell?

01:01:47.205 --> 01:01:48.815
Car is coming. Finish.

01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:53.211
Okay. Trying to.

01:01:53.385 --> 01:01:56.867
Fucking contact.

01:01:59.913 --> 01:02:01.828
What the hell?

01:02:05.136 --> 01:02:06.354
Yulia!

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.227
Dad, I'm coming.

01:02:17.191 --> 01:02:18.802
Jesus, what now?

01:02:20.847 --> 01:02:22.022
Hey, baby.

01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:23.545
Hey, what's up?

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.417
My dad's, like, freaking out
at me right now.

01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:27.071
We have to leave in, like,
five minutes.

01:02:27.245 --> 01:02:28.550
Okay, yeah, yeah,
no problem, uh...

01:02:28.725 --> 01:02:31.162
Okay. Well, I'll call you
from the car.

01:02:31.336 --> 01:02:33.251
I love you.

01:02:36.689 --> 01:02:37.821
Fuck! Fuck!

01:02:37.995 --> 01:02:38.996
Scuba, go!
No!

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:40.606
Yulia!

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.695
- No! Fuck no!
- Yulia!

01:02:42.869 --> 01:02:44.958
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:02:45.132 --> 01:02:46.786
No!
No! Fuck!

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.179
- Yulia!
- Fuck!

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:03.585
Dad! Dad!

01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:08.852
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:12.159
No, no!

01:03:15.772 --> 01:03:18.209
- Yulia! Yulia!
- Yulia!

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.127
Oh, fuck. Yulia!

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:25.782
Scuba! Hurry up! Hurry!
- Yulia!

01:03:25.956 --> 01:03:26.826
Scuba!

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.175
- Yulia!
- Yulia!

01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:31.222
Scuba, help me.

01:03:31.396 --> 01:03:33.702
- Let her fucking go.
- Scuba, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:35.835
Let her fucking go, or I'll
blow your fucking head off!

01:03:36.009 --> 01:03:37.358
He has Gaby and Evan.
They're alive. Fuck.

01:03:37.532 --> 01:03:38.577
- What do I do, Jess?
- Where are they?

01:03:38.751 --> 01:03:39.926
Please, Scuba, please.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.449
- Where are they?
- Jess, what do I do?

01:03:41.623 --> 01:03:42.711
I don't know! I don't know!

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:44.539
Listen,
let her fucking go.

01:03:44.713 --> 01:03:46.019
Shoot him.
Shoot him, please, please.

01:03:46.193 --> 01:03:48.326
- Let her fucking go!
- Scuba! Scuba.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.457
- Stop!
- Shoot him! Shoot him now!

01:03:49.631 --> 01:03:51.546
Scuba. Scuba, the safety.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.157
- Take off the safety.
Fuck!

01:04:12.393 --> 01:04:14.265
What do I...
what do I do, Jess?

01:04:15.744 --> 01:04:17.311
Jess, what do I do?

01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:22.969
It doesn't seem real. I mean,

01:04:23.143 --> 01:04:24.579
I-I can't even believe
this is really happening.

01:04:24.753 --> 01:04:26.451
How does this happen
in a place like this?

01:04:26.625 --> 01:04:27.844
I mean, is there any...

01:04:28.018 --> 01:04:29.454
Like, what are they...
What do you do?

01:04:29.628 --> 01:04:31.195
Somebody need to call SWAT?
I mean, have you ever?

01:04:31.369 --> 01:04:32.631
I mean, maybe we should move.

01:04:32.805 --> 01:04:34.546
I-I don't want to move.
I love this house.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.504
We're not moving. It's
not even a possibility to move.

01:04:36.678 --> 01:04:38.332
They're not gonna
let me... I-I just need...

01:04:38.506 --> 01:04:40.160
I just need...
Give me a couple of seconds.

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:41.814
I just think
we're all in agreement

01:04:41.988 --> 01:04:43.511
that we're not gonna be
participating in the parade.

01:04:43.685 --> 01:04:45.426
I'm with you, Thomas.

01:04:47.385 --> 01:04:49.604
Well, I know I'm not going.
It's too dangerous.

01:04:49.778 --> 01:04:52.346
And it's not dangerous
for Gaby and Evan?

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:57.003
You saw what he did to Yulia.

01:04:57.177 --> 01:04:59.223
I can't let that
happen to them.

01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:00.746
We have to stop him.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.791
This parade is our chance
to catch him.

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:05.055
If we hide, then what?

01:05:05.229 --> 01:05:07.013
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

01:05:07.187 --> 01:05:08.797
looking over my shoulder.
Do you?

01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:12.366
You're right, Jess.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.065
- I'm in. Let's do this.
Look.

01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:16.805
Right Mart has extra security,

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.633
so we don't have to worry
about the store. Okay?

01:05:18.807 --> 01:05:21.027
And as far as I'm concerned,
the parade has been decided.

01:05:21.201 --> 01:05:24.248
God, I do not want to be
dragged into this any further.

01:05:24.422 --> 01:05:25.814
I mean, if you hadn't even gone

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:27.555
into the store,
this would've never happened.

01:05:27.729 --> 01:05:29.166
- Enough, Kathleen.
- Don't you mean you?

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.819
You're the one who wanted
to open the store.

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:32.909
Nobody was
"Nostra-fucking-damus"

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:34.867
to predict what happened
last year.

01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:37.435
Besides, this year,
I'm closing the store.

01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:39.393
Thanksgiving's a holiday,
even for us.

01:05:39.567 --> 01:05:40.873
Wait, honey, what?

01:05:41.047 --> 01:05:42.005
Kathleen,
it's the right thing to do.

01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:43.571
I made the decision.
It's final.

01:05:45.486 --> 01:05:46.923
Sheriff, is there a way
to set a trap?

01:05:47.097 --> 01:05:48.359
Well...

01:05:48.533 --> 01:05:51.101
when the float returns
to the warehouse,

01:05:51.275 --> 01:05:52.885
we can make it
look like it's empty.

01:05:53.059 --> 01:05:55.496
Make him think there's
an opportunity to strike.

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:57.150
And if he takes the bait,

01:05:57.324 --> 01:05:58.586
it'll be over
right there and then.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.153
The bait?

01:06:00.327 --> 01:06:02.547
Excuse me, I don't want us
being used as bait.

01:06:02.721 --> 01:06:04.941
We don't finish it now, we'll
be bait no matter where we go.

01:06:05.115 --> 01:06:06.246
My daughter's right.

01:06:08.988 --> 01:06:12.122
Tomorrow, John Carver
is gonna go down.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.308
All right, Lionel, turkey time.

01:06:26.963 --> 01:06:28.921
Here we go.

01:06:52.162 --> 01:06:54.294
I want two people
up here to keep an eye on that.

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:56.601
Over here as well.
See this whole section?

01:06:56.775 --> 01:06:58.298
Keep an eye on that for me,
will you? Hey.

01:06:58.472 --> 01:06:59.996
- Hey.
- Okay, when you get back here,

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:01.562
this place is gonna look empty,

01:07:01.736 --> 01:07:03.173
but I'm gonna be here,
and this whole place

01:07:03.347 --> 01:07:04.913
will be crawling
with officers, okay?

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:07.568
- Yup. Thank you, Sheriff.
- You're welcome.

01:07:07.742 --> 01:07:09.309
Hi.

01:07:09.483 --> 01:07:11.007
- Thank you for coming.
- Mm.

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:13.270
You ready?

01:07:13.444 --> 01:07:15.228
- No.
- Good.

01:07:15.402 --> 01:07:18.144
Me neither. Let's do this.

01:07:18.318 --> 01:07:20.625
Okay.

01:07:20.799 --> 01:07:21.974
Hey, Jess.

01:07:23.193 --> 01:07:24.237
Uh...

01:07:25.673 --> 01:07:26.718
What's this?

01:07:26.892 --> 01:07:27.980
Oh, it's my dad's ring
from Iraq.

01:07:28.154 --> 01:07:30.243
He said it kept him alive.

01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:32.332
Uh, i-if you want,
wear it for good luck.

01:07:33.638 --> 01:07:35.596
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:07:48.914 --> 01:07:50.872
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:07:59.272 --> 01:08:00.708
Hi.

01:08:18.335 --> 01:08:19.771
Pilgrims!

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:23.296
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:09:08.472 --> 01:09:10.604
Down with Right Mart!

01:09:10.778 --> 01:09:12.998
Down with Right Mart!
Down with Right Mart!

01:09:13.172 --> 01:09:14.608
What's going on?

01:09:14.782 --> 01:09:16.871
Down with Right Mart!
Down with Right Mart!

01:09:17.045 --> 01:09:18.221
What the hell
is going on down there?

01:09:18.395 --> 01:09:19.439
It's Mitch.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.225
Get off the parade route.
Get off!

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.617
Get off! Move along.

01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:25.228
- Come on, come on.
- It's nothing. Okay.

01:09:35.455 --> 01:09:37.196
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:40.895
You have a great day.
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:09:45.726 --> 01:09:47.685
Happy Thanksgiv...

01:10:00.306 --> 01:10:01.786
Grandpa, Grandpa, watch out!

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.179
Stop the truck!

01:10:04.876 --> 01:10:06.443
Watch out!

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.059
- Come on.
Go, go.

01:10:14.233 --> 01:10:15.756
Go.

01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:18.803
- Wake up! Grandpa! Wake up!
- Grandpa, wake up! Wake up!

01:10:18.977 --> 01:10:21.197
- Grandpa, wake up! Grandpa!
- Wake up! Wake up!

01:10:22.894 --> 01:10:24.374
Come on, get in, get in,
get in, get in, get in!

01:10:24.548 --> 01:10:25.984
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go!

01:10:26.158 --> 01:10:28.116
- In, in, in, in, in!
- Oh, shit.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.509
Get us out of here.

01:10:43.306 --> 01:10:44.524
Cover your ears.

01:11:59.295 --> 01:12:06.171

echo of your last goodbye ♪

Shh. He's right there.
He's right...

01:15:59.404 --> 01:16:01.014
He's coming. He's right there.

01:16:01.188 --> 01:16:02.538
Please be quiet.

01:16:02.712 --> 01:16:04.496
Shh. Please.
I'll be right back. No.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.324
- Don't leave.
- I'll come back. I'll come back.

01:16:07.847 --> 01:16:09.675
Be quiet. Be quiet. Shh.

01:16:09.849 --> 01:16:10.981
-  Don't leave.
- I'll come back.

01:16:11.155 --> 01:16:13.897
Don't leave. No.

01:17:17.787 --> 01:17:20.572
No. No! No!

01:17:22.922 --> 01:17:25.229
Help me! Let me out!

01:17:28.928 --> 01:17:30.060
No.

01:17:30.234 --> 01:17:31.148
No, no, no.

01:17:31.322 --> 01:17:33.367
No. No!

01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:34.891
No! No.

01:17:35.065 --> 01:17:37.067
No!

01:17:43.073 --> 01:17:45.075
Help me. Please don't kill me, please.

01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:46.946
Please!

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.556
Open the door! Open the...

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:50.384
Please, please don't do this. Please.

01:17:50.558 --> 01:17:52.038
Please, I'm begging you, please!

01:17:52.212 --> 01:17:53.474
No!

01:17:57.914 --> 01:18:01.221
No. No! No! No! Please.

01:18:01.395 --> 01:18:03.049
No!

01:18:03.223 --> 01:18:05.269
No, please!

01:18:05.443 --> 01:18:06.444
No!

01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:11.667
No! Please!

01:18:11.841 --> 01:18:13.930
No... No!

01:18:16.106 --> 01:18:18.674
No! No!

01:18:30.337 --> 01:18:32.905
I'm live outside the Plymouth
Sheriff's Department

01:18:33.079 --> 01:18:36.343
where outraged citizens
are demanding answers

01:18:36.517 --> 01:18:39.390
after a performer was murdered
in broad daylight

01:18:39.564 --> 01:18:41.653
at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

01:18:41.827 --> 01:18:44.264
Flash grenades,
smoke bombs.

01:18:44.438 --> 01:18:45.744
I think he's ex-military.

01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:47.224
Could be.

01:18:47.398 --> 01:18:48.529
There's no way
he's in a civilian car.

01:18:48.704 --> 01:18:50.009
Yeah.

01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:51.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I-I got something.

01:18:51.619 --> 01:18:52.577
What do you got?

01:18:54.622 --> 01:18:57.234
He's live streaming
from somewhere in Cordage Park.

01:19:00.541 --> 01:19:02.587
What the fuck is that?

01:19:04.545 --> 01:19:06.112
Labelle, let's go.

01:19:06.286 --> 01:19:09.115
I'll try to lock the
coordinates in. Calling SWAT.

01:19:09.289 --> 01:19:11.770
I need SWAT and all units
at Cordage Park, immediately.

01:19:24.174 --> 01:19:27.264
There's nothing here.
We're in a parking lot.

01:19:27.438 --> 01:19:29.483
It's telling me
you're in the exact spot.

01:19:29.657 --> 01:19:31.137
I'm telling you,
there's fuck all here.

01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:32.356
I don't see nothing.

01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:33.618
This way.
- Fuck!

01:19:35.489 --> 01:19:37.665
Are there tunnels underneath us?

01:19:48.633 --> 01:19:50.069
We'll each take an exit.

01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:51.592
Labelle, you take Water Street
and Mayflower.

01:19:51.767 --> 01:19:52.680
I'll take Green and Union.

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:54.073
You guys take Doten Street.

01:19:54.247 --> 01:19:55.683
SWAT's gonna flush him out.
Got it?

01:19:55.858 --> 01:19:57.033
Okay? Let's go.

01:20:01.689 --> 01:20:03.300
You'll be okay.

01:20:03.474 --> 01:20:04.954
It's gonna be okay.

01:20:12.222 --> 01:20:14.746
Go, go, go! Take it down!

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.269
On three.
- Ready?

01:20:16.443 --> 01:20:18.184
Two lines, two columns.

01:20:18.358 --> 01:20:19.620
Copy.

01:20:19.795 --> 01:20:20.796
Go, go. Cover my six.

01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:21.927
Copy that.

01:20:23.668 --> 01:20:25.931
Closing in on the signal.

01:20:26.105 --> 01:20:28.455
Go, go, go!

01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:31.284
Break it in.
- Copy.

01:20:37.029 --> 01:20:38.161
Did you find them?

01:20:38.335 --> 01:20:39.858
Give me a sitrep.

01:20:40.032 --> 01:20:41.381
Did you find them?

01:20:44.123 --> 01:20:45.429
What the fuck?

01:20:50.826 --> 01:20:52.828
It's a fucking monitor.

01:20:53.002 --> 01:20:54.612
Damn.

01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:01.140
He's using a new cell.

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.404
Gather 'round.

01:21:05.536 --> 01:21:06.929
No, no, no. No.

01:21:07.103 --> 01:21:09.409
Gather 'round the table, everyone.

01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:14.806
Dinner is served.

01:21:26.513 --> 01:21:28.385
Goddamn.

01:21:28.559 --> 01:21:29.865
What the fuck is that?

01:21:30.039 --> 01:21:31.605
What the fuck?

01:21:31.779 --> 01:21:33.303
Now, is that any way
to thank Kathleen?

01:21:33.477 --> 01:21:36.436
She's been cooking all day.

01:21:42.529 --> 01:21:46.577
Let's start off the dinner
with a cheer

01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:49.885
from our cheerleader.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.286
Fresh from my wine refrigerator.

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.985
She'll pair nicely
with Kathleen.

01:22:03.159 --> 01:22:05.378
I'm scared. I'm scared.

01:22:05.552 --> 01:22:08.642
You might want to
let that breathe.

01:22:14.126 --> 01:22:18.043
So nice to all be together
again on Thanksgiving.

01:22:18.217 --> 01:22:20.393
And joining us... Dad!

01:22:20.567 --> 01:22:22.482
Our guest of honor,
Thomas Wright,

01:22:22.656 --> 01:22:25.964
who missed last year's fun
sitting in his mansion.

01:22:27.879 --> 01:22:30.099
Hmm.

01:22:30.273 --> 01:22:32.536
Now...

01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:35.191
we're all going to go
around the table

01:22:35.365 --> 01:22:38.281
and say what we're thankful for.

01:22:38.455 --> 01:22:41.023
You're on live,
so choose your words wisely.

01:22:41.197 --> 01:22:43.155
Evan.

01:22:43.329 --> 01:22:46.202
No, no, no, no, no. No, Ev.

01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:49.683
Most appropriate that
you go first.

01:22:49.857 --> 01:22:52.686
You see, it was your video

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.603
that inspired me to make my own.

01:22:56.777 --> 01:22:57.996
Okay.

01:23:00.216 --> 01:23:01.521
Evan!

01:23:01.695 --> 01:23:02.740
No.

01:23:02.914 --> 01:23:04.481
Help! Help!

01:23:04.655 --> 01:23:06.483
- We're-we're in an old house!
- Let him go!

01:23:06.657 --> 01:23:08.441
Let him go!

01:23:08.615 --> 01:23:10.400
So get ready, Evan.
- No, no, no, no.

01:23:10.574 --> 01:23:12.315
- You're about to go viral.
- Please don't kill me...

01:23:12.489 --> 01:23:15.013
You're going to
break the Internet.

01:23:15.187 --> 01:23:17.450
- Let him go!
- No!

01:23:20.888 --> 01:23:23.195
No one appreciates subtlety anymore.

01:23:23.369 --> 01:23:24.936
To go viral,

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:27.243
you really need to hit people
over the head.

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:28.505
Right, Evan?

01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:35.991
Mm.

01:23:36.165 --> 01:23:37.993
Look at all those likes.

01:23:38.167 --> 01:23:39.559
Congratulations, Evan.

01:23:39.733 --> 01:23:41.387
You're a star.

01:23:44.869 --> 01:23:47.393
Now that I have
your attention...

01:23:47.567 --> 01:23:51.267
you're probably wondering
why you're still alive

01:23:51.441 --> 01:23:53.443
and they were all killed.

01:23:53.617 --> 01:23:55.662
They were just greedy.

01:23:55.836 --> 01:23:57.708
But you...

01:23:57.882 --> 01:23:59.536
you're the VIPs.

01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:02.321
It wasn't enough to get
in the store early.

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:04.541
You had to
taunt everyone outside

01:24:04.715 --> 01:24:06.412
to show them
how special you were.

01:24:06.586 --> 01:24:10.329
Well, once this video
goes viral,

01:24:10.503 --> 01:24:12.288
everyone will know
how special you are.

01:24:14.159 --> 01:24:16.770
Too bad you won't be alive
to see it.

01:24:16.944 --> 01:24:20.035
This will be the most famous
Thanksgiving dinner

01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:22.341
since 1621.

01:24:24.039 --> 01:24:27.607
And every year,
people will watch this video...

01:24:29.435 --> 01:24:30.523
and think of your greed

01:24:30.697 --> 01:24:33.439
and the people who died from it.

01:24:34.614 --> 01:24:36.660
Now, let's eat.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.316
Thomas.

01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:42.448
You love your consumers.

01:24:46.191 --> 01:24:48.889
Well, tonight's your night
to be one.

01:24:59.770 --> 01:25:02.512
Take a bite of your lovely wife

01:25:02.686 --> 01:25:04.905
and show me
how thankful you are.

01:25:10.998 --> 01:25:13.175
Show me that you're thankful...

01:25:13.349 --> 01:25:14.567
or die.

01:25:21.879 --> 01:25:23.054
Oh, fuck!

01:25:24.403 --> 01:25:25.230
Go, go, go!

01:25:25.404 --> 01:25:27.537
Run! Go!

01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:29.278
Go, go, go!
- Run! Run!

01:25:29.452 --> 01:25:30.670
This way!

01:25:30.844 --> 01:25:32.498
Oh, fuck!

01:25:32.672 --> 01:25:33.978
Watch out!

01:25:34.152 --> 01:25:35.936
Scuba!

01:25:37.895 --> 01:25:39.505
Scuba, this way, this way, go.

01:25:41.768 --> 01:25:42.769
- It's the Carver House.
- The door, door.

01:25:42.943 --> 01:25:44.119
Jess, go, go, go.

01:26:49.009 --> 01:26:50.533
Sheriff?

01:26:54.276 --> 01:26:56.016
Sheriff.

01:27:43.412 --> 01:27:44.804
: It's me.

01:27:44.978 --> 01:27:46.066
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

01:27:46.241 --> 01:27:47.590
: It's Bobby.

01:27:47.764 --> 01:27:49.331
It's Bobby. It's Bobby.

01:27:49.505 --> 01:27:50.810
- He went that way.
- Okay, get outside, get outside.

01:27:50.984 --> 01:27:51.942
Get outside. Just get out.

01:27:52.116 --> 01:27:53.030
- Come on.
- He went that way.

01:28:01.212 --> 01:28:03.823
No. No.

01:28:07.087 --> 01:28:08.088
- He's in there.
- No.

01:28:08.263 --> 01:28:09.307
I think I shot him.

01:28:09.481 --> 01:28:11.222
- No.
- Then I lost him.

01:28:12.789 --> 01:28:14.138
All clear here.

01:28:14.312 --> 01:28:15.357
Check over there.

01:28:25.105 --> 01:28:27.412
Oh, sir.
Detective Chu says you need

01:28:27.586 --> 01:28:29.675
to turn in your service weapon
since it's been fired.

01:28:29.849 --> 01:28:31.895
- Right, right. Yeah, of course.
- Sorry, pal.

01:28:32.069 --> 01:28:33.810
No, don't worry about it.
I understand.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.168
Sheriff,

01:28:44.342 --> 01:28:46.475
we, uh, found this on the floor.

01:28:46.649 --> 01:28:48.999
Still logged
into the John Carver account.

01:28:49.173 --> 01:28:51.131
Thanks, Pete.

01:28:52.219 --> 01:28:53.569
It's Bobby's.

01:28:53.743 --> 01:28:55.484
We have every police officer

01:28:55.658 --> 01:28:57.703
in a hundred-mile radius
searching for him.

01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:02.926
They, uh...

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:05.581
They had to sedate your father
pretty heavily.

01:29:05.755 --> 01:29:07.800
He'll be in the hospital a few
days, along with your friends

01:29:07.974 --> 01:29:09.585
Gaby and Scuba.

01:29:10.977 --> 01:29:13.719
I'm... sorry
about Kathleen and Evan.

01:29:17.984 --> 01:29:19.638
Labelle.

01:29:19.812 --> 01:29:21.161
Chu, see you at the hospital.

01:29:21.336 --> 01:29:22.337
We'll be there in a minute.

01:29:22.511 --> 01:29:24.817
See you there.

01:29:24.991 --> 01:29:26.906
We'll see you there, Sheriff.

01:29:32.259 --> 01:29:34.349
You're really brave, you know.

01:29:36.525 --> 01:29:38.657
Thank you.

01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:40.659
Couldn't have done this
without you.

01:29:42.095 --> 01:29:43.793
Can you just give me a minute

01:29:43.967 --> 01:29:45.882
to catch my breath,
and then... and then we can go?

01:29:46.056 --> 01:29:47.840
Yeah, sure.

01:29:48.014 --> 01:29:50.016
I'll be right back.

01:30:19.524 --> 01:30:20.830
You ready?

01:30:35.061 --> 01:30:37.934
ERIC [VOICE-OVER]:
It's about the details.

01:30:38.108 --> 01:30:41.503
Small mistakes,
that's how they get caught.

01:30:41.677 --> 01:30:43.679
I could really use
your help, Jessica.

01:30:43.853 --> 01:30:47.247
Couldn't have
done this without you.

01:30:47.422 --> 01:30:49.032
But you got to be careful
who you trust.

01:30:51.687 --> 01:30:53.776
Jess, you okay?

01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:55.778
S-Sorry.

01:30:55.952 --> 01:30:58.345
Um...

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.913
I'm-I'm not feeling well.

01:31:01.087 --> 01:31:02.959
We'll have a doctor
check you out.

01:31:04.047 --> 01:31:05.440
Come on.

01:31:20.411 --> 01:31:23.849
If only you'd be stuck
on the fence a second longer.

01:31:38.037 --> 01:31:40.387
It's like fumbling
on the one-yard line.

01:31:42.607 --> 01:31:44.957
It's almost funny
if you really think about it.

01:31:50.615 --> 01:31:52.487
You should see the look
of surprise on your face.

01:31:54.097 --> 01:31:55.533
What about Bobby?

01:31:55.707 --> 01:31:56.839
Bobby?

01:31:57.013 --> 01:31:59.494
I had him drugged,
dressed up,

01:31:59.668 --> 01:32:01.539
ready to be shot,

01:32:01.713 --> 01:32:05.151
putting an end to the mystery
of John Carver's identity.

01:32:05.325 --> 01:32:08.546
But when I opened the trunk,
he popped me with a tire iron.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.679
Thankfully,

01:32:10.853 --> 01:32:12.681
you pointed me
in the right direction...

01:32:12.855 --> 01:32:14.509
again.

01:32:14.683 --> 01:32:17.729
You've been using me...
this whole time?

01:32:17.903 --> 01:32:21.428
When I said, I couldn't
do this without your help,

01:32:21.603 --> 01:32:24.127
I really meant it.

01:32:25.258 --> 01:32:27.609
Why?

01:32:27.783 --> 01:32:31.526
Why... are you doing this?

01:32:32.657 --> 01:32:35.094
Mm.

01:32:35.268 --> 01:32:39.534
Mitch wasn't the only one
who lost someone that night.

01:32:42.232 --> 01:32:45.452
My wife left me,
and Amanda put me back together.

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:47.063
I loved her.

01:32:47.237 --> 01:32:49.805
She was gonna leave Mitch.

01:32:49.979 --> 01:32:52.198
But then, you and your friends
took her from me.

01:32:57.116 --> 01:32:59.292
You took my family from me.

01:33:03.253 --> 01:33:05.647
So now, instead of spending
Thanksgiving with Amanda,

01:33:05.821 --> 01:33:07.823
I am stuck here in this office.

01:33:07.997 --> 01:33:10.956
And now, so are you.

01:33:11.130 --> 01:33:13.263
I'd love to keep chatting,

01:33:13.437 --> 01:33:15.308
but now, I got to take care
of some loose ends.

01:33:15.482 --> 01:33:16.571
Wait.

01:33:16.745 --> 01:33:18.268
I-I didn't get to tell you

01:33:18.442 --> 01:33:20.487
what I was thankful for.

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.317
What are you thankful for?

01:33:26.319 --> 01:33:27.712
The service in here.

01:33:39.855 --> 01:33:42.466
You should see the look
of surprise on your face.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.599
You fucking bitch.

01:33:54.609 --> 01:33:57.089
Jess.

01:33:57.263 --> 01:33:59.004
- Hey. Come on.
- Bobby?

01:33:59.178 --> 01:34:00.789
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:34:03.182 --> 01:34:05.489
- Hey, come on, come on.
- Oh, wait. Wait.

01:34:06.621 --> 01:34:08.623
Aw, fuck.

01:34:10.015 --> 01:34:11.669
Look. Your uncle's truck.

01:34:11.843 --> 01:34:12.975
Jessica?!
Shh.

01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:15.368
Shh. Get down.

01:34:22.593 --> 01:34:25.291
Sorry, Jessica.

01:34:25.465 --> 01:34:27.772
This year, there will be...

01:34:27.946 --> 01:34:30.993
no... leftovers!

01:34:42.613 --> 01:34:45.529
When I told your stepmother,

01:34:45.703 --> 01:34:48.793
she would make
an excellent dinner...

01:34:50.708 --> 01:34:52.623
that... was not...

01:34:52.797 --> 01:34:55.931
a lie!

01:35:03.242 --> 01:35:04.853
Go.

01:35:07.377 --> 01:35:09.292
This way. Come on. Come on.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.457
Oh.

01:35:53.945 --> 01:35:57.383
Bobby?!

01:35:59.124 --> 01:36:00.212
Bobby!

01:36:01.474 --> 01:36:03.041
No!

01:36:15.227 --> 01:36:18.927
-  Bobby, go!
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:36:19.101 --> 01:36:20.276
It's the... it's the cable.

01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:22.887
I'm trying to drive.
It's not moving.

01:36:58.183 --> 01:37:00.490
Hey, Sheriff, you were right!

01:37:00.664 --> 01:37:02.231
No... leftovers!

01:37:02.405 --> 01:37:05.887
Jessica!

01:37:17.028 --> 01:37:19.509
Roger on unit 121.

01:37:23.165 --> 01:37:24.993
Come here.

01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:26.733
Take care of yourself.

01:37:26.908 --> 01:37:28.170
I'll call you from school.

01:37:28.344 --> 01:37:30.259
- Be safe.
- Yeah.

01:37:30.433 --> 01:37:33.740
Tell Ryan he's still a dick,
even if he's not the killer.

01:37:37.657 --> 01:37:39.964
Oh, Jess.

01:37:42.924 --> 01:37:44.534
Hey.

01:37:44.708 --> 01:37:46.666
I thought you guys were
at the hospital.

01:37:46.841 --> 01:37:48.799
We technically still are.

01:37:48.973 --> 01:37:50.845
We saw the stream.

01:37:51.019 --> 01:37:54.109
Detective. We searched
every inch of that place.

01:37:54.283 --> 01:37:55.850
Everything was incinerated.

01:37:56.024 --> 01:37:58.113
There's nothing but ash.

01:37:58.287 --> 01:38:01.159
No one could survive a blast
like that.

01:38:40.546 --> 01:38:41.939
You okay?

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.335
