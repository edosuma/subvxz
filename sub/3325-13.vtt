WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.333
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.545 --> 00:05.161
You, Allison and Stiles
need to be sacrifices

00:05.381 --> 00:07.246
You'll be giving power back to the Nemelon.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.881
lt attracts the supernatural.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.880
lt'll also have an effect on the three of you.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.927
It'll be a kind of a darkness.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.100
I'm an Alpha now.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.332
No, no, no, no, no...

00:52.053 --> 00:53.634
Don't let them in.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.473
Don't let them in.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.550
No, don't let them in.

02:49.295 --> 02:52.662
You okay? Stiles?

02:58.179 --> 03:00.135
Yeah, I was just dreaming.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.140
It was weird.
It was like a dream within a dream.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.722
A nightmare?

03:08.481 --> 03:09.641
Yeah.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.991
Wait a second, Lydia.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.571
What are you doing here?

03:32.171 --> 03:33.251
Hang on.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.871
Stiles, where are you going?

03:36.092 --> 03:37.878
I should have closed the door.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.134
Just go back to sleep.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.761
No, no, I should close it.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.304
Don't worry about it.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.758
What if someone comes in?

03:49.397 --> 03:50.557
Like who?

03:55.027 --> 03:56.528
Just go back to sleep, Stiles.

03:58.531 --> 04:00.567
No. But what if they get in?

04:05.496 --> 04:07.157
What it who gets in?

04:09.166 --> 04:12.829
Stiles, just leave it. Please.

04:17.717 --> 04:21.335
Stiles. Stiles, come back to bed.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.836
Stiles. Please.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.673
Don't, Stiles. Don't!

04:28.102 --> 04:30.309
Don't go in there, please, don't.
Please, Stiles, don't!

04:57.089 --> 05:00.047
It's a dream. This is just a dream.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.547
It's just a dream,
get it out of your head, Stiles.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.593
You're dreaming. All right?
So, wake up, Stiles.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.435
Wake up, Stiles.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.264
Wake up!

05:20.488 --> 05:23.275
Hey, time to get up, kiddo.
Get your butt to school.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.698
And you couldn't wake up?

05:35.461 --> 05:37.827
- Uh, no, do I want to?
- Have you ever had a dream

05:38.005 --> 05:40.667
where you feel like you're about
to wake up but you can't move or talk?

05:40.883 --> 05:41.918
Yeah. Yeah, I've had that.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.126
It happens because during REM sleep
your body is basically paralyzed.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.711
It's called muscle atonia.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.299
That way it you start dreaming
about running,

05:48.516 --> 05:50.052
you don't actually
start running in your bed.

05:50.226 --> 05:51.306
That makes sense.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.805
But sometimes your mind can wake up
before your body does.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.263
So for this split second, you're actually
aware that your body is paralyzed.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.101
And that's the terrifying part.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.183
It turns your dream into a nightmare.

06:01.487 --> 06:02.727
You can feel like you're falling,

06:02.947 --> 06:04.858
like you're being strangled, or, in my case,

06:05.074 --> 06:06.610
like you're at
the center of a grove of magical trees

06:06.826 --> 06:08.316
where human sacrifices took place.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.662
You think it means something?

06:10.871 --> 06:14.034
What if what we did that night,
what if it's still affecting us?

06:14.250 --> 06:16.741
- Post-traumatic stress?
- Or something.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.788
But you want to know
what scares me the most?

06:26.178 --> 06:28.134
I'm not even sure this is real.

06:36.522 --> 06:40.014
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.183
You're okay.

07:45.341 --> 07:46.706
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey.

07:46.926 --> 07:49.008
Um, are you going to school?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.256
- Yeah.
- Okay, me too.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.549
Good.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.765
- Can I ask you a question?
- Okay.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.138
- Are you angry at me?
- No.

07:59.355 --> 08:00.470
Are you sure?

08:00.940 --> 08:01.975
No.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.775
What's that mean?

08:04.777 --> 08:07.314
I guess I'm not really sure how I'm feeling.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.021
- Okay. Do you hate me?
- No, of course not.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.566
- Do you want to hit me?
- No.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.951
I think you should hit me.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.074
- I don't want to hit you.
- Are you sure?

08:18.374 --> 08:20.239
Why would I want to hit you?

08:20.459 --> 08:21.960
You didn't do anything, did you?

08:22.378 --> 08:24.289
No. No, I mean...

08:25.965 --> 08:27.045
What do you mean?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.999
I mean, like,
you didn't kiss her or anything, right?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.835
No! Absolutely not. No.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.676
- Did you want to?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.229
Hey!

08:44.400 --> 08:46.311
You two supernatural teenage boys,

08:46.527 --> 08:50.111
don't test my entirely
un-supernatural level of patience.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.985
Feel better?

09:13.178 --> 09:14.384
Hey.

09:15.973 --> 09:16.928
You all right?

09:20.936 --> 09:23.552
- You ready for school?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.641
Dad, seriously, I'm fine.
It was just a nightmare.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.185
What's that?

09:32.031 --> 09:34.898
That's just, uh, files from the office.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.695
It says "Sheriff's station, do not remove."

09:37.953 --> 09:39.489
Well, yeah, unless you're the Sheriff.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.196
- Oh.
- Now get your butt to school, all right?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.337
Gotta run, Dad. I'm late!

11:24.935 --> 11:26.550
Kate, Kate, what are you doing?

11:27.479 --> 11:28.810
I'm sorry.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.733
Allison, are you okay?

13:11.917 --> 13:14.408
Hey. Hey, you all right?

13:18.048 --> 13:19.879
You don't look all right, Scott.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.753
- I'm okay.
- No, you're not.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.551
It's happening to you too.
You're seeing things, aren't you?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.213
How'd you know?

13:29.935 --> 13:31.926
Because it's happening to all three of you.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.637
Well, well, look who's
no longer the crazy one.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.340
We're not crazy.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.804
Hallucinating? Sleep paralysis?

14:13.979 --> 14:15.560
Yeah, you guys are fine.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.647
We did die and come back to life.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.607
That's gotta have some side effects, right?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.735
We keep an eye each other. Okay?

14:25.741 --> 14:27.982
And, Lydia, stop enjoying this so much.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.190
What?

14:32.414 --> 14:35.156
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Mr. Yukimura.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.752
I'll be taking over
for your previous history teacher.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.206
My family and I
moved here three weeks ago.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.338
I'm sure, by now,
you all know my daughter, Kira.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.668
Or you might not since she's never
actually mentioned anyone from school.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.920
Or brought a friend home for that matter.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.849
Either way, there she is.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.367
Now, let's begin with American history
at the turn of the 20th century.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.929
Not the steadiest hand
for a superb marksman.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.546
It's been happening for the past few weeks.

15:32.724 --> 15:33.964
Since that night.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.479
Start over.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.330
Maybe we need a little more time
to get back to normal.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.832
Yeah, try not to forget
we hit the reset button

16:05.048 --> 16:07.334
on a supernatural beacon
for supernatural creatures.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.008
There's a pretty good chance things
are never going back to normal.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.626
Yeah.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.266
What?

16:18.437 --> 16:20.143
I thought
you said you wanted to make friends.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.473
Not like that.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.396
You said you wanted to be noticed.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.269
I could set myself on fire and be noticed.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.434
- Well, then you'd be dead.
- Exactly.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.316
Kira. Kira.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.003
Oh, dude, your eyes.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.751
What about them?

16:46.047 --> 16:47.662
They're starting to glow.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.505
- You mean like right now?
- Yes, right now.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.254
Scott, stop. Stop it.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.472
I can't...
I can't control it.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.802
All right, just keep your head down.
Look down, come on.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.305
Keep your head down.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.315
- Get back. Get away from me.
- Scott, it's okay.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.859
I don't know what's going to happen.
Get back.

17:40.936 --> 17:44.645
- Pain makes you human.
- Scott, this isn'tjust in our heads.

17:45.357 --> 17:46.813
This is real.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.772
And it's starting to get bad for me too.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.361
I'm notjust having nightmares.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.315
I'm having these dreams where
I have to literally scream myself awake.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.286
And sometimes I'm not even sure
if I'm ever actually waking up.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.450
What do you mean?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.211
Do you know how you can tell
if you're dreaming?

18:08.171 --> 18:09.877
You can't read in dreams.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.789
More and more, the last few days,
I've been having trouble reading.

18:13.051 --> 18:17.590
It's like I can't see the words.
I can't put the letters in order.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.133
Like even now?

18:39.911 --> 18:41.526
I can't read a thing.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.129
Do you really think
this is going to help?

18:53.300 --> 18:56.212
I know that if you think
it's not going to help, it definitely won't.

18:58.847 --> 18:59.962
So get your head into it,

19:00.181 --> 19:01.762
shoot a few and see what happens.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.641
Oh.

19:23.788 --> 19:27.952
Maybe hold the string a different way.

19:29.544 --> 19:30.954
Try the Mongolian draw.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.579
What? I read.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.416
Try it.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.220
Okay, um...

19:47.979 --> 19:50.186
Take a second to close your eyes

19:51.024 --> 19:54.187
and imagine the arrow
going into the target.

20:04.746 --> 20:05.952
Did you see that?

20:07.248 --> 20:08.374
See what?

20:12.087 --> 20:13.372
Wait here.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.291
- Are you serious?
- I'll be right back.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.708
You did notjust say that.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.433
Over here.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.843
Lydia?

20:31.231 --> 20:33.438
Allison, over here.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.558
Lydia?

20:38.363 --> 20:39.523
- Over here, Allison.
- Allison.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.609
- Over here, Allison.
- Over here.

20:41.825 --> 20:42.985
Lydia!

21:06.224 --> 21:08.636
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Lydia.

21:12.147 --> 21:14.980
- Right at her head?
- Almost right through it.

21:15.859 --> 21:19.272
And she keeps saying the same thing,
that she keeps seeing her aunt.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.945
Whatever's happening
to you guys is getting worse.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.398
If I hadn't been there,
then Lydia would be dead.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.578
What were you doing there?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.410
Ah...

21:33.042 --> 21:34.782
Oh, you guys, come on.

21:35.003 --> 21:38.291
This house does not
have a supernatural ability to heal!

21:38.506 --> 21:40.462
So, stop it!

21:40.842 --> 21:43.003
You know, the last time
we brought one of these to her grave,

21:43.219 --> 21:46.427
it was stolen the same day.
Hundred bucks down the drain.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.468
Hey,Dad?

21:50.685 --> 21:53.301
Hi, what are you doing down there?

21:53.480 --> 21:54.936
Working. And hey,

21:55.148 --> 21:58.060
if somebody wants the flowers
that badly, they can have them.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.777
It's the gesture.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.105
Hey, Dad, what is all this?

22:02.322 --> 22:04.483
I've been looking over some old cases

22:04.699 --> 22:07.236
from a more illuminated perspective,
if you know what I mean.

22:07.619 --> 22:11.203
"Strange sighting of bipedaled lizard man
sprinting across freeway."

22:11.706 --> 22:13.321
Kanima pile.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.833
Dad, you're not going back
through all your old cases

22:17.045 --> 22:20.583
seeing if any of them had something to do
with the supernatural, are you?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.707
I admit the recent opening of my eyes

22:23.927 --> 22:28.967
to the greater mysteries
of the universe has got me reassessing.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.051
There's at least 100 cases here

22:31.267 --> 22:33.474
where I look
at the details and I can ask myself,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.682
"If I knew then what I know now..."

22:36.898 --> 22:38.889
Right, but are you sure
you wanna go down that path?

22:39.901 --> 22:41.482
Do I have a choice?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.485
There's one case in particular
that I can't get out of my head.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.731
Eight years ago,
when I was elected Sheriff of County,

22:47.951 --> 22:50.442
my first official duty was to tell a man

22:50.662 --> 22:54.200
that not only had his wife and two kids died
in a car accident,

22:54.415 --> 22:57.953
but, as best we could tell,
the body of his 9-year-old daughter

22:58.169 --> 23:00.410
had been dragged
from the wreck by coyotes.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.750
You mean dragged and eaten?

23:03.883 --> 23:06.670
We didn't find the car
until three days after the crash.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.973
They had driven off the road
into a pretty deep ravine.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.386
Two bodies that
were still in the car were covered

23:17.605 --> 23:19.186
in bites and slashes.

23:20.984 --> 23:24.943
So you're thinking bites and claw marks,
probably a werewolf attack?

23:25.405 --> 23:27.566
- Maybe.
- But coyotes, they scavenge, right?

23:27.782 --> 23:30.899
So, couldn't they have
just left the bites and the slashes?

23:31.119 --> 23:32.484
Absolutely.

23:33.037 --> 23:36.200
But guess what night
the accident occurred on?

23:39.043 --> 23:40.249
The night of a full moon.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.000
Yeah.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.249
Hey, Dad, where are all these going?

23:48.469 --> 23:49.720
Yeah, we, uh...

23:53.558 --> 23:55.549
We probably need to talk about that.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.358
Hi, sorry, I usually sit there.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.993
Okay, no problem. That's all yours.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.298
That's weird.

24:38.269 --> 24:41.432
Hey, Coach. Thought I was
in the wrong class for a second.

24:43.608 --> 24:44.939
Um... Okay.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.102
I don't actually know sign language.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.444
Actually, I didn't even know
that you knew sign language.

24:53.618 --> 24:57.406
Or that that was even an elective here.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.873
Well, this has been good,
I'm probably gonna, uh, head out.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.230
Stilinski!

25:26.859 --> 25:29.191
- Uh-huh?
- I asked you a question.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.443
Uh... Sorry, Coach. What was it?

25:31.614 --> 25:34.572
It was, "Stilinski, are
you paying attention back there?"

25:35.201 --> 25:37.908
Oh, well, I am now.

25:38.663 --> 25:41.496
Stilinski, stop reminding me why I drink.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.244
Every night.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.620
Does anybody else
want to try the question on the board?

25:47.046 --> 25:49.537
I'm okay. I just fell asleep for a second.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.798
Dude...

25:53.845 --> 25:55.460
You weren't asleep.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.143
Okay, so what happens to
a person who has a near-death experience

26:12.363 --> 26:13.819
and comes out of it seeing things?

26:14.032 --> 26:15.818
And is unable to tell what's real or not?

26:16.034 --> 26:17.820
And is being haunted by
demonic visions of dead relatives?

26:18.036 --> 26:19.992
They're all locked up
because they're insane.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.365
Ha. Can you at least try
to be helpful, please?

26:22.790 --> 26:24.291
For half my childhood,
I was locked in a freezer.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.081
So, being helpful is
kind of a new thing for me.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.409
Hey, dude, are you still milking that?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.368
- Yeah, maybe I am still milking that.
- Hi.

26:29.589 --> 26:34.458
Hi, sorry. I couldn't help overhearing
what you guys were talking about.

26:35.261 --> 26:39.004
And I think I actually
might know what you're talking about.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.342
There's a Tibetan word for it.
It's called "Bardo."

26:44.062 --> 26:46.178
It literally means "in-between state."

26:46.397 --> 26:48.934
The state between life and death.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.981
And what do they call you?

26:51.611 --> 26:52.817
Kira.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.772
She's in our history class.

26:57.992 --> 27:01.735
So are you talking "Bardo"
in Tibetan Buddhism or Indian?

27:02.080 --> 27:05.618
Either, I guess.
But all the stuff you guys were just saying?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.581
All that happens in "Bardo."

27:08.377 --> 27:10.413
There are different progressive states
where you can have hallucinations.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.044
Some you see, some you just hear.

27:12.256 --> 27:15.043
And you can be visited
by peaceful and wrathful deities.

27:15.259 --> 27:18.626
Wrathful deities?
And what are those?

27:19.430 --> 27:20.545
Like demons.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.796
Demons.

27:22.475 --> 27:23.840
- Why not?
- Hold on,

27:24.060 --> 27:26.802
if there are different progressive states,
then what's the last one?

27:27.021 --> 27:28.522
Death. You die.

27:32.193 --> 27:35.936
It sounds like your subconscious is trying
to communicate with you.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.568
Well, how do I tell my subconscious
to use a language that I actually know?

27:39.784 --> 27:41.820
Do you remember what
the sign language looked like?

27:42.036 --> 27:43.901
The placement
and movement of the hands?

27:44.122 --> 27:46.078
- You know sign language?
- I know a little.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.076
Let me give it a shot.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.998
Okay, the first one was like this.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.502
- Then...
- That's "when."

27:53.923 --> 27:57.006
- Then there was this, twice.
- That's door.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.587
- And this in between it.
- That's it?

28:00.054 --> 28:02.761
- Yeah.
- "When is a door not a door?"

28:03.808 --> 28:05.799
"When is a door not a door"?

28:06.811 --> 28:08.096
When it's ajar.

28:08.563 --> 28:12.021
You're kidding me. A riddle?
My subconscious wants to tell me a riddle?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.682
Not necessarily. When the three of you
went under the water,

28:14.861 --> 28:19.104
when you crossed from unconsciousness
to a kind of superconsciousness...

28:19.323 --> 28:21.905
You essentially opened
a door in your minds.

28:22.243 --> 28:25.155
So what does that mean?
The door's still open?

28:25.413 --> 28:26.448
Ajar.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.826
A door into our minds?

28:30.042 --> 28:31.828
I did tell you it was risky.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.204
What do we do about it?

28:33.421 --> 28:35.833
Well, that's difficult to answer.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.424
No, wait a second, I know that look.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.043
That's the "we know exactly
what's wrong with you,

28:39.218 --> 28:40.549
"but we have no idea how to fix it" look.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.137
One thing I do know

28:42.346 --> 28:44.837
is that having an opening
like that into your mind,

28:45.057 --> 28:46.012
it's not good.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.012
You each need to close that door.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.390
And you need to do it as soon as possible.

29:03.701 --> 29:07.068
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- I'm here because

29:07.288 --> 29:08.903
I could use some help.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.823
Actually... Your help.

29:12.043 --> 29:13.032
Why me?

29:13.252 --> 29:16.744
Because eight years ago, almost an entire
family died in a car accident.

29:17.632 --> 29:21.341
One of the bodies,
a young girl named Malia, was never found.

29:21.886 --> 29:24.002
There's enough evidence
to have me thinking that...

29:25.389 --> 29:27.926
That a werewolf could have
caused the accident,

29:28.142 --> 29:29.848
and then dragged her body away.

29:30.061 --> 29:32.177
If you could somehow
get a lock on her scent,

29:32.396 --> 29:34.853
if you could somehow
help me find her body,

29:35.358 --> 29:37.064
it might provide the missing clue.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.562
But what if it was a werewolf?

29:39.779 --> 29:42.771
Well, there's somebody out there
who murdered an entire family.

29:44.158 --> 29:46.365
Someone who still needs to be caught.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.549
I've been having a coyote problem.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.087
The population is up around here

30:08.391 --> 30:10.052
and they get into everything.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.554
That doesn't exactly
look big enough to catch one.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.180
It's a rat trap.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.604
Take away the coyote's
source of food and they leave you alone.

30:16.857 --> 30:20.475
And these days, to be honest,
I'd prefer to be left alone.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.987
I understand. Just a couple
of questions and I promise I'll leave.

30:43.426 --> 30:45.087
New evidence?

30:46.095 --> 30:47.255
Possibly.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.890
- All I'm getting is some animal smell.
- What kind of animal?

30:54.979 --> 30:56.059
Dog.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.857
Hi, puppy. Get rid of it.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.777
- Me?
- Yes, you. Glow your eyes at it, something,

31:05.990 --> 31:07.321
be the Alpha.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.149
I can't. I don't have control.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.077
Okay, buddy, you're going to
have to try something.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.291
Nice doggy...

31:25.634 --> 31:27.135
Apollo!

31:27.928 --> 31:30.920
Apollo, shut up! Shut the hell up!

31:40.649 --> 31:42.185
Here. Try that.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.071
Anything?

31:47.031 --> 31:48.817
All I'm getting is that dog.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.160
Murder?

32:02.380 --> 32:05.417
I spent eight years thinking
that it was an accident

32:05.633 --> 32:07.624
and now you're telling me that
it could be murder?

32:09.387 --> 32:12.550
Who the hell would want
to murder my wife and girls?

32:12.765 --> 32:14.471
My whole family?

32:15.601 --> 32:18.684
That's what I want to find out.

32:18.896 --> 32:19.851
I don't.

32:20.064 --> 32:24.148
I don't want to redefine this
entire nightmare as an unsolved murder.

32:24.819 --> 32:27.401
Just leave me alone with tragic accident.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.945
Because that's what
I've spent eight years getting used to.

32:30.157 --> 32:32.022
Accident. Not murder.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.611
I apologize.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.193
Just go!

32:40.918 --> 32:43.534
I'm sorry.
I tried as hard as I could.

32:43.754 --> 32:46.131
If it wasn't so long ago,
I might have been able to do it.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.251
It's okay. It was a long shot.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.174
In fact, it was a pretty terrible idea.

32:51.429 --> 32:54.512
I think I just ripped a wound open
in that poor man.

32:54.807 --> 32:58.425
I never should have brought you guys here.
I don't know what I was thinking.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.351
- Thanks for trying, all right?
- Yeah.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.100
See you at home.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.438
Aren't there a lot of cases that go unsolved?

33:12.992 --> 33:15.483
Yeah, Ijust think this is one he felt like

33:15.703 --> 33:17.739
he could've figured out right now.

33:17.955 --> 33:19.491
Why is it so important now?

33:21.167 --> 33:24.910
He wants to be able to
solve one more while he's still sheriff.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.253
What do you mean, "still sheriff"?

33:30.968 --> 33:32.754
- No one invited you. Okay?
- I'm here to help.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.799
That doesn't make any sense, Dad.
Who are you helping?

33:36.015 --> 33:37.676
- Just get out.
- Scott...

33:37.892 --> 33:41.009
What? I can't believe that
you'd do this to my best friend.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.014
I'm not doing anything to your friend.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.186
- I'm doing my job.
- Yourjob sucks.

33:45.691 --> 33:46.771
Some days I can't argue that.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.728
Can somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?

33:48.986 --> 33:51.318
- He's trying to get Stiles' dad fired.
- No. That's not true.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.613
- What are you doing?
- Conducting a case for impeachment.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.406
That sounds a lot like getting him fired.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.742
The lack of resolution
and ability to close cases

33:58.954 --> 34:00.034
is what's going to get him fired.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.408
My job is just to collect the information.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.240
And it's the job
my superiors have given me.

34:04.460 --> 34:05.666
Your job sucks.

34:09.924 --> 34:12.131
Scott... Sweetheart...

34:14.261 --> 34:15.341
Calm down.

34:16.847 --> 34:18.633
Come with me right now.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.387
Let it go. Just breathe and let it go.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.096
I'm trying.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.477
You told me you and Stiles
learned a way to control this.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.561
You find an anchor, right?

34:34.782 --> 34:36.192
Find your anchor.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.274
My anchor was Allison.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.365
I don't have Allison anymore.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.037
Then be your own anchor.

34:45.209 --> 34:46.574
You can do this.

35:02.017 --> 35:06.181
Sweetheart, let me tell you something
no teenager ever believes,

35:06.355 --> 35:08.892
but I swear to you is the absolute truth.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.896
You fall in love more than once.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.236
It'll happen again.

35:16.699 --> 35:20.191
And it'll be just as amazing
and as extraordinary as the first time.

35:20.369 --> 35:21.905
And maybe just as painful.

35:22.204 --> 35:25.037
But it will happen again, I promise.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.787
And until then...

35:29.003 --> 35:30.834
Be your own anchor.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.173
Hey, what's going on?

35:40.347 --> 35:42.759
You and me.
We're going to go out and find a body.

35:46.395 --> 35:48.056
A dead body.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.742
You're sure Scott's okay with this?

36:08.417 --> 36:09.623
Isaac.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.538
Yeah.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.582
He's 100 percent over it.

36:15.549 --> 36:17.085
He said that?

36:18.594 --> 36:20.425
Not in so many words, but...

36:22.973 --> 36:24.383
He's moved on.

36:26.143 --> 36:28.099
You should too.

36:37.196 --> 36:38.652
What's around your neck?

36:42.951 --> 36:44.236
Let's do him, Allison.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.694
Let's do him together.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.976
You know, if my dad's right,
that means

37:11.146 --> 37:12.886
there's another werewolf in town
that we haven't met yet.

37:13.065 --> 37:14.225
I know.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.352
If it turns out to be something like triplets

37:16.568 --> 37:18.559
that form into, like,
a three-headed hound of hell,

37:18.737 --> 37:21.353
- I'm seriously not up for that.
- Yeah. Me either.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.656
Especially if I can't even control my
own transformation anymore.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.672
Sorry, buddy.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.455
I hate coyotes so much.

37:39.675 --> 37:42.633
They always sound like they're mauling
some tiny, helpless little animal.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.512
It still works.

37:55.733 --> 37:57.269
Let me see the flashlight.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.779
I think we found it.

38:06.076 --> 38:07.156
Uh...

38:07.536 --> 38:10.198
Why wouldn't they move it?
Isn't it evidence?

38:12.291 --> 38:14.873
Probably too much
of a pain in the ass to tow out.

38:23.343 --> 38:24.844
Look at this.

38:31.435 --> 38:32.800
See those?

38:35.898 --> 38:39.015
Animal claws would be
closer together, right? A lot closer.

38:42.738 --> 38:44.353
Then it was a werewolf.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.860
So, my dad was right.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.830
What is that?

39:13.101 --> 39:14.307
I'm hungry.

39:17.064 --> 39:18.520
I think I just had a minor heart attack.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.897
Hey, Stiles.

39:27.658 --> 39:29.489
Please tell me you see that.

39:34.456 --> 39:35.741
I see it.

39:38.961 --> 39:41.202
