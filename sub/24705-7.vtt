WEBVTT

00:33.533 --> 00:35.243
I... I need to see Detective Kelly.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.245
He's busy right now, Lou.
Take a seat over there.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.914
- Uh, can you cuff me to the bench?
- The CO doesn't want anyone

00:40.081 --> 00:41.958
unnecessarily restrained in public areas.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.210
- Unnecessarily?
- I don't wanna hear it, Lou.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.712
Hey, you don't wanna see it either,
I'm telling you.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.213
You wanna see a werewolf in a blood rage?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.007
Take a seat now!

00:49.507 --> 00:51.843
I'm doing this for your own good,
Sergeant, I'm telling ya.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.387
One minute we could be standing here,
talking to each other very nicely,

00:54.512 --> 00:56.264
next thing you're gonna be on your back,
looking at me

00:56.264 --> 00:58.600
- with your windpipe in my fangs.
- I'm a cop, Lou.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.101
I'm paid to live with danger.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.853
I'm telling ya.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.732
I'm a werewolf. I gotta be locked up
by five o'clock tonight, or else...

01:05.899 --> 01:08.568
Lou! Sit! Sit!

01:11.321 --> 01:12.947
Sit.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.162
Hello, 15.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.796
Detective Kelly!

01:28.880 --> 01:29.923
Lou!

01:32.717 --> 01:34.385
I can probably get you
a couple hours, Lou,

01:34.511 --> 01:36.179
but I can't guarantee
you're gonna be alone.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.224
Come on, I can't be incarcerated
in a group situation.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.060
- It would be like a smorgasbord for me.
- It's the best I can do, Lou.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.522
Bellevue Hospital has got a whole wing
of padded kennels, Lou.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.441
You oughta give them a howl.
They'll lock you down tonight.

01:48.691 --> 01:51.611
You think I'm crazy? I'm not crazy.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.906
- I am a werewolf.
- But you could be a crazy werewolf, Lou.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.992
I mean, I hear a lot of them are nuts.
You oughta have it checked out.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.538
I come here to try to protect society,
and you're seeking to humiliate me?

02:01.788 --> 02:02.914
Lou, nobody's trying
to humiliate you.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.582
We're just getting a lot of heat
from our bosses

02:04.707 --> 02:05.959
about these protective lockups.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.961
- Try the hospital.
- I feel anger.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.881
- I feel anger!
- Well, you'll get over it, Louie.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.886
I better get outta here before I commit
an unspeakable outrage.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.097
Yeah, okay, Lou.
Anything you say.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.976
I don't wanna take you away
from all the fun you're having there.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.144
What do you got?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.396
Yeah, but, uh, you wanna check
the report, see if it's right?

02:26.396 --> 02:28.022
Huh?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.444
- Go ahead.
- Sure.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.323
Hey, Andy.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.284
You busy? Can I speak to you
for a minute?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.077
Yeah, sure.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.580
Remember my partner, John Kelly?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.041
- Yeah.
- Hey, kid. Nice to see you again.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.293
How you doin'?

02:49.544 --> 02:51.546
Want some, uh, coffee or a soda?

02:51.796 --> 02:53.173
No, thanks.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.600
It's been a while, huh?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.144
You look good.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.065
I keep meaning to...
to get over to Jersey.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.111
How's your mother?

03:15.820 --> 03:18.031
She's okay. How you doin'?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.117
I'm good. I'm... I'm fine.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.494
Wanna sit down?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.373
Nah, that's okay.

03:30.418 --> 03:34.547
I came to tell you that I've been seeing
this girl for three months,

03:34.547 --> 03:38.134
and it's pretty serious.
I mean, we're getting married.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.721
You're still my father.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.348
I figured you might wanna know.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.977
Yeah, sure I wanna know.
You're 18 years old.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.146
So, uh, tell me about the girl.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.440
- Uh, how old is she?
- Twenty.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.151
So, what does she do,
this, uh, this 20-year-old?

03:55.401 --> 03:56.945
She sells sports cars.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.740
Checkered Flag Motor Cars in Fort Lee.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.244
See, I'm... I'm...
I'm trying to figure out

04:04.369 --> 04:06.454
what makes this...
this car saleswoman different.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.164
Why, uh, why you wanna drag the state,

04:08.164 --> 04:10.124
and the church into things
all of a sudden?

04:11.709 --> 04:15.672
I'd like to borrow 700 bucks.
I can pay you back 40 a week.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.176
You know, Andy...

04:21.928 --> 04:24.806
when a girl gets knocked up,
a man's first impulse

04:24.931 --> 04:27.475
- might be to...
- Look. Forget about the 700 bucks.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.395
I'll forget about feeding the guests
at my wedding.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.564
And, uh, as far as fatherhood...

04:34.399 --> 04:35.650
I don't wanna hear what you think.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.860
Hey, Andy. I'm trying to look out for you.

04:39.737 --> 04:40.738
Don't!

04:41.906 --> 04:45.285
You haven't got the right.
I haven't seen you for three years.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.996
Where you hiding
your liquor bottles these days?

04:48.371 --> 04:51.082
You know, I was 12 before I realized...

04:51.082 --> 04:53.751
that wasn't what the saddlebags
on my bike were for.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.920
I stopped drinkin'.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.757
Maybe you should go back to it.
That's something you only get better at.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.428
Hey, hey, Andy. Hey, Andy! An... Andy!

05:03.428 --> 05:06.764
Andy! Andy, listen to me. Come here.
Listen to me now.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.476
You know, everybody's life
has twists and tensions,

05:10.935 --> 05:13.855
so don't you assume that you know
all the answers, all right?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.606
Don't assume that you ever will.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.818
Are you gonna charge me,
or you gonna let me go?

07:03.464 --> 07:06.050
Let me get out in front on this
so nobody gets overexcited, okay?

07:06.050 --> 07:08.136
I betcha every guy in Jersey's
banged this girl.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.263
Let's wait till we know
before you jump to the answers.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.890
I'd rather find out how mistaken I've been
and get overjoyed.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.226
- You gonna let me work on this?
- Three reasons why I should.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.395
- One, two, three.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.355
- How you doing?
- Can I be of assistance,

07:19.355 --> 07:20.982
or are you "lookie-loos?"

07:20.982 --> 07:23.568
- We wanna see your manager.
- Could I tell him what it's about?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.279
Do you know what it's about?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.780
You can find Mr. Stipley in there.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.449
You have the invoice number, sir?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.575
Thanks.

07:33.536 --> 07:37.331
Mr. Stipley. Detective Kelly.
Detective Sipowicz.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.835
Oh, New York City police.
Sit down, detectives. Sit down.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.422
And, uh, feel free
to be completely candid.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.634
I'm a Lieutenant
with the Paramus PD Reserves.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.513
Well, that'll, uh,
make things much easier then.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.808
Lieutenant, what I'm about
to tell you is confidential.

07:55.808 --> 07:56.893
I understand.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.228
In the course of a criminal investigation,

07:59.562 --> 08:03.191
our, uh, phone surveillance monitors
picked up a call from your switchboard.

08:04.650 --> 08:08.154
It was a young woman,
and based on the substance of the call...

08:09.071 --> 08:12.116
we got the impression that
this young woman and the man she called...

08:12.116 --> 08:14.368
This other person
being the one you're interested in.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.705
- ...that these two were sexually involved.
- Oh.

08:18.539 --> 08:22.877
So, uh, you're looking to ascertain
the identity of, uh, the female caller,

08:23.044 --> 08:26.088
with an eye to developing her
as a potential corroborating witness.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.384
- Am I right?
- Well, I can't confirm or deny, but, uh,

08:31.052 --> 08:32.720
do you have any idea
who might have made the call?

08:33.471 --> 08:37.308
Well, it can't be Ellen. She hates men,
and her tits point to China.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.895
Uh, so it's gotta be Patty Constance.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.814
Uh, do you consider her
to be relatively attractive,

08:44.023 --> 08:45.066
early twenties?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.567
Yeah, she's around 20, all right.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.237
Or she's around 30,
depending how you look at it.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.447
Uh, that's her. Second from the right.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.080
You might have seen her when you came in.
Uh, she's on a test-drive now.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.751
- Is she married?
- No. She's got plans.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.711
Uh, some poor dumb teenager I hear.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.173
You know, uh,
she's one of my best salespeople

09:09.173 --> 09:12.093
and I don't wanna be judgmental, but, man,

09:12.218 --> 09:14.929
uh, you got the missile,
she's got the silo.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.474
Kevin says she screws the head off
and goes to work on the wires.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.309
- Kevin?
- Yeah, salesman you met.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.436
Married guy. Patty's seeing him too.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.689
Besides the teenager?

09:27.108 --> 09:29.026
- You got a phone I can use?
- Yeah, uh,

09:29.193 --> 09:30.194
right around the corner.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.702
Why's a number like her wanna marry a kid?

09:38.119 --> 09:41.539
You want me to speculate, Detective?
A teenager like that?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.625
Probably puts the wood to her
whenever she's in the mood.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.212
Uh, picks up tapes for the VCR,
brings her coffee in the shower,

09:48.421 --> 09:49.755
washes her car in the driveway.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.716
He's a household convenience.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.803
Believe me, it ain't gonna stop her
from shoppin' around for a better deal.

09:56.220 --> 10:00.057
Andy. We got a missing kid.
Fancy wants to get on it.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.272
Lieutenant,
thank you for your help.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.369
What is it?

10:20.369 --> 10:22.538
We got a missing nine-year-old,
and we've been looking

10:22.538 --> 10:24.790
since about 11:00 last night.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.878
- Detective Kelly. Detective Sipowicz.
- Hi.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.504
I... I'm Rudolf Wentz.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.299
My son is missing.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.510
All right. Let's go inside
and talk about it, okay?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.054
- Let's go inside.
- Sure.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.853
My neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, says
that children in America

10:46.103 --> 10:49.148
sometimes disappear for days
and that is common.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.025
Eh, but these children, they come back.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.693
That's usually what happens.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.154
- Rudy has never run away.
- No.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.614
He is nine.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.117
- Just nine.
- Had you argued with him? Was he angry?

11:01.285 --> 11:04.163
We moved from the Katowice, in Poland.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.917
Coming to a strange country, I think
has made us much closer as a family.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.460
We don't fight so much.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.837
Was he upset about anything?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.756
No. No.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.549
He was lonely.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.928
We spent time with him, both of us.
We go, uh,

11:19.387 --> 11:22.640
restaurants, the movies, anywhere,
we take Rudy.

11:24.308 --> 11:28.354
And you know, Detective, it's no trouble.
It's fun for all of us.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.565
We love him.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.944
But still, he... he was lonely.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.949
The description said he was wearing,
uh, red shorts and a white T-shirt.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.786
When he asked to go
to the store, I told him,

11:43.953 --> 11:47.623
"Put on a jacket and long pants.
It's chilly," but his father...

11:47.623 --> 11:51.460
It was just to the store. One block.
Uh, he was coming right back.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.546
Well, it's warm
for this time of year anyway.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.015
Here's a picture.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.616
I'm telling you, this one
don't turn out good.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.827
- Uh. Uh-huh.
- Could be okay. Family like that?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.580
That kid didn't run away.
This one don't turn out good.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.165
I hate it when you know it.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.438
Hey, hey, kid. Kid!

13:35.356 --> 13:37.775
Come here. Let me... let me ask you
a question. What's your name?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.736
- Albert.
- Albert, uh,

13:41.028 --> 13:42.321
do you know... do you know what I am?

13:42.696 --> 13:43.781
- Huh?
- A cop.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.076
Yeah, that's right. I'm a detective.
Listen, uh...

13:49.078 --> 13:51.163
this kid here,
he didn't come home last night.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.623
His name is Rudy Wentz.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.125
He's got like, uh, a foreign accent.
You seen him around?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.963
No. Ask Freddy.
He knows all the kids around here.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.714
Freddy. Who... who's Freddy?

14:01.465 --> 14:05.135
I don't know his last name.
He's kinda skinny, yellow pants.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.429
What? He wears yellow pants every day?

14:07.888 --> 14:08.931
Every day.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.269
- How old's this guy Freddy?
- Pretty old. Maybe 30.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.688
Phew! You know where he stays at?

14:16.397 --> 14:18.065
Uh-huh. I think he's homeless.

14:19.441 --> 14:23.279
All right, listen. Uh, you see Freddy
or, uh, this kid Rudy,

14:23.696 --> 14:25.865
you call the number
on the back of this card, okay?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.283
- Will you do that for me?
- Sure.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.450
- All right.
- See ya.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.494
Uh, you know what?

14:30.786 --> 14:34.081
Um, I think Freddy sometimes stays
in this empty place

14:34.081 --> 14:35.416
about six blocks that way.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.128
There's a bunch of guys there that get in
and out on a rope they drop from a window.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.590
- Yeah? Come on, show me the place.
- Uh, it's about six blocks, man.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.302
Hey, Albert. You want me to jerk you up
in the air like a little bug,

14:46.302 --> 14:49.388
so your arms and legs whip around
in front of the whole street here, huh?

14:49.388 --> 14:51.432
- No.
- No, then come on. Show me the way.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.065
- Good morning, Alfonse.
- Good morning, Laurie. You look terrific.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.358
Thanks. I'll be right outside.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.861
- Ready for the big day?
- Your star witness is all ready.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.779
But, uh, sit down a second.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.991
There's something I wanna...
I wanna talk to you about in confidence.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.702
I'd really like to go over
your trial testimony, Alfonse.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.871
Mr. Giardella,

15:14.455 --> 15:16.957
did you sell heroin in volume
to Augusto Reyes?

15:17.249 --> 15:20.085
"Yes, I did." In the course
of that professional relationship,

15:20.210 --> 15:22.296
did there come a time when Reyes told you

15:22.296 --> 15:24.131
that the Colon brothers
ripped him off for product?

15:24.798 --> 15:25.799
"That is correct."

15:25.925 --> 15:27.760
Did he ever make threats
against the Colon brothers?

15:28.177 --> 15:30.721
"Yeah, several times he threatened to kill
the Colon brothers."

15:31.347 --> 15:33.682
After the Colon brothers
were subsequently killed,

15:34.224 --> 15:36.143
did Reyes ever talk to you
about their deaths?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.980
"Yeah, he said, 'I whacked both
those sons of bitches.'"

15:40.439 --> 15:42.650
Thank you, Mr. Giardella. You're excused.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.152
That's very good.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.782
Laura, come on.
You gotta keep lookin' at your watch?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.784
I'm hopin' our friend Jimmy Craig

15:51.784 --> 15:53.827
- gets himself lost in the elevator.
- Why?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.914
Because this is gonna
be our last time together.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.291
After I testify,
the feds are gonna take me away,

15:59.708 --> 16:03.212
but before I go, I have to give you
something to remember us by.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.172
What's this?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.926
The keys to my Cadillac. This year's.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.679
A 24-month lease all paid for,
all the forms signed for

16:11.679 --> 16:12.805
and everything. It's all yours.

16:14.598 --> 16:17.267
I can't accept a car from you, Alfonse.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.603
It's not a car. It's a Cadillac and...

16:20.562 --> 16:22.898
if you look at the papers,
it's not from me.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.110
It's from Stellamonte Concrete,
which is completely above board,

16:26.443 --> 16:28.070
and totally untraceable anyway.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.532
- I have a car, Alfonse.
- You got four doors and a windshield.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.451
Laura...

16:37.413 --> 16:40.416
Laura, I'm trying to tell you
how high it is a value

16:40.416 --> 16:42.001
I place on our relationship.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.628
I'm trying to signify something
to you here.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.923
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah, sure.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.137
What? You gotta go to the bathroom
or something?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.014
- Yeah, you know where it is.
- Yeah. Just...

16:55.014 --> 16:57.725
Yeah. It's right over there.
J... just help yourself.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.602
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, you know, and if I come back, uh,

17:00.602 --> 17:03.188
we could drive wherever, you know.
Maybe, uh,

17:03.814 --> 17:06.775
maybe one of them, uh,
breakfast and board places

17:06.775 --> 17:08.110
in them quaint areas.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.278
You know, one of them places

17:09.445 --> 17:13.991
with the quilts on the bed, and, uh,
those pictures of the whaling guys.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.536
One of these days,

17:17.661 --> 17:20.122
all this bouncing around
like a cue ball is gonna stop.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.333
I'm gonna get myself set up somewhere.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.878
Out west, maybe. Can you hear me, Laura?

17:27.755 --> 17:28.922
You fall in in there?

17:29.423 --> 17:30.632
- Be right out.
- I'm gonna leave

17:30.632 --> 17:31.842
my past behind.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.343
Well, most of it, anyway.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.305
And if we can get along, Laura,
and I think we will...

17:39.308 --> 17:42.144
Oh! Oh, my God!

18:37.491 --> 18:39.451
- What a mess.
- He got away through the window.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.161
- I beeped you right away, sir.
- Yeah.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.122
Hell of a way
to decorate a room.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.126
Excuse us, please.

18:48.836 --> 18:49.920
You okay?

18:50.087 --> 18:53.006
- I think so.
- Okay. Did you see anything?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.593
I saw him, the window washer.
I'm gonna have to testify, aren't I?

18:56.802 --> 18:59.805
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?
- I'm... I was the only one here.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.224
The guy is gone. He got away.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.143
I'm gonna have to testify against him,
aren't I?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.562
Laura, you're gonna have to promise me
you're gonna take it easy, okay?

19:06.562 --> 19:10.566
I'm gonna be right back.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

19:11.483 --> 19:14.862
All right. Would you stay with her,
please? I'll be right back.

19:23.620 --> 19:27.583
Okay, initial here and here
at the cross-outs and sign at the bottom.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.585
Go ahead.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.714
Okay. All right. That's enough.
Let's get you home,

19:33.714 --> 19:35.257
and if they want more,
they can get it later.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.383
Yeah, okay. Okay.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.886
- Here we go.
- Laura. Laura.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.179
Hey, Laura.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.348
- So, how you feeling now?
- Lieutenant...

19:43.348 --> 19:44.725
Uh, I'm okay.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.768
- Uh, John Kelly. James Craig.
- Hey!

19:46.894 --> 19:50.105
Oh, hey. How you doing, Detective?
So, uh, look.

19:50.105 --> 19:53.692
I notified the judge about Giardella
and we're moving Perez up to testify,

19:53.817 --> 19:57.946
but, uh... So I'm gonna run down there now
unless you want me to stay.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.781
- No, no, no. I'm okay.
- You sure?

20:00.657 --> 20:04.703
Look, I'm, uh... I'm sorry this happened.
I'm sorry you had to be there.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.332
- Good seeing you again.
- Yeah. Take it easy.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.668
- Detective Kelly, I gotta talk to you.
- Not now, Lou.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.503
No, I can't be responsible anymore.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.671
Have to look out
for yourself today.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.381
I know I'm goin' full-on wolf.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.259
No, no, no. My... my human nature
is seepin' out of me.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.094
By five o'clock, it's gonna be all gone!

20:21.094 --> 20:23.096
- I need a ride for her too.
- I... I... I tell you.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.891
You gotta listen to me.
Something terrible is gonna happen!

20:26.475 --> 20:28.435
I'm begging for preventative protection!

20:28.435 --> 20:30.562
Lou. He thinks he's a werewolf.
He's harmless.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.272
- Oh.
- I'm gonna...

20:32.522 --> 20:35.067
- Excuse me, Laura. John.
- I'm gonna get you a ride. Okay?

20:36.693 --> 20:39.112
A child's body's been found
near where the Wentz boy disappeared.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.156
Sipowicz and Martinez
are on their way over there.

20:41.865 --> 20:42.908
Okay.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.498
I, uh, I got a lot going right now.
You got my beeper, right?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.417
- Yeah, I've got it.
- Okay. 'Cause, uh,

20:52.668 --> 20:54.086
you know,
if you get into trouble later on,

20:54.086 --> 20:55.337
I want you to give me a call.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.797
I really think I'm going to be okay.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.216
Okay. Well, you may feel okay now.
You may not later.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.635
- Point taken, Johnny. Okay?
- Okay.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.137
So, you got the beeper. This is your man.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.722
- Ma'am.
- Uh,

21:05.931 --> 21:08.558
and use it later if you need to. Okay?

21:09.309 --> 21:12.479
I'll be around, all right? Take care.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.152
- How's she doing?
- I don't know.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.113
- We'll have to see.
- It's awful she had to see that.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.158
Yeah. Yeah, I uh,
I gotta get upstairs to get my jacket.

21:25.325 --> 21:28.120
- They, uh... they found a kid.
- Okay.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.622
- Am I gonna see you tonight?
- Uh, I don't... I don't know.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.625
- I don't know if tonight's gonna be good.
- Last night was pretty good.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.228
- Step right here.
- Get your gloves.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.693
Thanks.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.158
- What do we got?
- Looks like sexual assault.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.869
Strangulation.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.705
Oh, God, I knew it. I knew... I knew it.

22:14.791 --> 22:17.377
Look at that. He could see his house.

22:18.253 --> 22:21.590
Look at that, John.
The kid died lookin' at his house.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.195
Detectives.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.113
Could we come in, Mr. Wentz?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.657
- Please.
- Go ahead.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.752
Do you have news for us?

22:59.544 --> 23:00.587
Yeah.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.217
I wish there was a way to say
this that wouldn't hurt you, Mr. Wentz.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.892
We found a body similar
to the description of your son.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.398
We'd like you to come with us
to the medical examiner's office

23:19.523 --> 23:22.234
- and clear up the identification.
- Is it Rudy? Is it our boy?

23:22.609 --> 23:23.944
Well, we don't know for certain.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.654
That's why we need you to come down
with us.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.080
When I knock on the glass,
the blind will open.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.458
All you'll see is the face.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.295
- But it may not be my boy.
- It may not be.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.674
But you should prepare yourself
for the possibility that it is.

24:27.966 --> 24:32.262
You said yourself that many boys, uh,
many children run away.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.513
Is that not so?

24:39.352 --> 24:40.645
Are you ready, Mr. Wentz?

25:46.962 --> 25:49.339
Give 'em a call. Tell them I'm on my way.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.465
Okay, Lieutenant.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.428
- Uh, this guy you're looking for? Freddy.
- Yeah, what do you got?

25:55.720 --> 25:58.223
Two different sightings
at the bus terminal about an hour ago.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.101
The Port Authority cops have been
over the area and he's not there now.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.561
Anybody actually see him get on the bus?

26:02.561 --> 26:05.605
No, but there'll be cops waiting
at every destination point

26:05.605 --> 26:07.566
for every bus that left
during that period.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.819
- Where you going?
- To look for this sick bastard.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.196
If I stay here,
my brains are gonna blow out of my ears.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.115
They got the neighborhood blanketed
in case he comes back.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.534
Come on, Kelly. He's not climbing
any of these ropes.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.286
They can forget looking
in those nit farms.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.413
This asshole knows he did a bad thing.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.789
- Where you gonna look?
- I don't know.

26:22.914 --> 26:23.999
I'll... I'll help the Port Authority cops.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.959
- You got a better idea?
- I'm a serious person.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.378
- And so am I, Lou
- I told myself when Giardella got his,

26:28.503 --> 26:31.715
it would be one of the happiest days
of my life, so far I'm not laughin'.

26:32.048 --> 26:34.426
- Lou!
- Well, there you go. Lon Chaney Jr.

26:34.884 --> 26:38.346
Why can't I make you understand?
Why can't I make him understand?

26:38.513 --> 26:40.849
I understand, Lou. You did it.
Jimmy Hoffa.

26:41.016 --> 26:44.436
Malcolm X. Sonny Corleone. You're guilty.
You did it all.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.981
- But I still got no room.
- I didn't do any of those things!

26:48.106 --> 26:50.317
I committed a crime under the bridge!

26:51.484 --> 26:54.946
Please, you have to listen to me.
It really happened!

26:55.113 --> 26:57.866
- What's going on, Lou?
- Murder. I did it.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.076
All right. I'll listen to him.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.331
- Let's go upstairs, Lou.
- Right.

27:07.584 --> 27:08.835
I was denned up.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.672
Then I caught this very aggressive smell.

27:13.256 --> 27:16.092
- It was coming off of this guy.
- What happened?

27:17.344 --> 27:18.386
Oh, God. I mean...

27:20.013 --> 27:21.097
It's all mixed up.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.851
When I'm a werewolf,
I don't think I have a temper.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.437
I'm beast! I'm fury!

27:29.439 --> 27:32.400
And... but... when I caught a whiff
of this guy,

27:32.651 --> 27:34.819
next thing I know I'm on top of him,
I cut him down.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.446
The son of a bitch
didn't even have a chance.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.698
Did you put a name to this guy?

27:40.533 --> 27:42.160
Yeah, they called him C-note.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.704
He was a nickel-piece dealer.

27:46.206 --> 27:50.293
And the day before I told him.
I said, "Stay off of my turf!"

27:50.919 --> 27:52.128
And he defied me.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.550
So, God help me, I cut him down.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.512
- And he was killed? This guy.
- Yeah.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.640
Wait till you see the report.
You'll see the pictures.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.433
Where's the body, Lou?

28:10.021 --> 28:11.147
It's under the bridge.

28:13.775 --> 28:14.984
I brought the murder weapon.

28:16.569 --> 28:18.446
I want you to know I regret what I did,

28:18.446 --> 28:20.365
and I'm ashamed
of everything inside of me.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.669
You got the murder weapon?

28:33.586 --> 28:34.629
Yeah.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.798
Lou, you're describing a vicious murder.

28:36.923 --> 28:40.969
Oh, I'm... I'm... I'm terrified
by my own capacities at such times.

28:42.929 --> 28:45.807
Why did you use the weapon
and not tear him apart with your teeth?

28:45.807 --> 28:48.643
Hey, look. I came in here,
and I admitted what I did, okay?

28:48.893 --> 28:51.438
You can't make me go over it
in my head all the time.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.565
I can't be thinkin' about it all the time.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.192
Let me just ask you a couple
of more questions, okay?

28:58.153 --> 29:00.655
Did this guy try and protect himself?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.160
- Huh, Lou?
- He tried.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.871
But you just kept slashing,
cutting into his clothes,

29:07.996 --> 29:10.957
his flesh, his tendons. Was he screamin'?
Lou?

29:11.750 --> 29:14.169
There must have been a lot of blood, no?
Huh?

29:14.669 --> 29:16.629
Soakin' his clothes,
pourin' out all over the place.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.506
Was it spillin' out on you, Lou? Huh?

29:18.631 --> 29:20.258
- Was he begging for his life?
- He was begging.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.011
I think we're talkin'
about two drug dealers

29:23.344 --> 29:26.723
fightin' over a piece of turf.
One stabbed the other. That was horrible.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.225
You didn't do it, but you saw it,
right, Lou?

29:29.642 --> 29:31.144
- Lou, look at me.
- I can't!

29:31.144 --> 29:33.188
Look at me! Come on, Lou.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.108
You are a rough wolf but a man did this.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.320
Lou, a man did this,
who needs to be in jail. Am I right?

29:40.445 --> 29:42.739
Lou. Talk to me, Lou.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.659
- Lou!
- I saw it.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.789
There were two dealers there too.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.794
And the one guy said to the other guy...

29:58.588 --> 30:01.508
..."You better have the money
by five o'clock or I'll..."

30:06.888 --> 30:09.265
And he... he didn't have the money today,

30:09.390 --> 30:11.476
and before I knew it,
the guy was stabbing him.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.441
And I knew something was going to happen.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.569
I tried to tell you
that something was gonna happen.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.281
But I... I was too crazy. I...

30:30.954 --> 30:31.955
Okay.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.123
You did the best you could.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.961
You think you could identify them
in a picture?

30:39.170 --> 30:40.213
Yeah.

30:41.631 --> 30:42.757
And his smell too.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.261
I'll help you however I can.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.389
- However I can.
- I know.

30:54.435 --> 30:55.436
Good boy.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.146
Good boy, Lou.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.148
Attaboy.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.366
- Martinez.
- Yeah.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.285
Voucher this, get it up to the lab,

31:10.285 --> 31:12.829
and get this guy up to Narcotics,
get a look at some photographs.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.163
See if he recognizes anybody.

31:14.163 --> 31:15.540
- Okay.
- You know... you know his story?

31:15.540 --> 31:16.791
Yeah, I've seen him in the station.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.418
Okay. I'm going over
his place by the bridge.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.544
All right. Lou, come here.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.422
Work with Officer Martinez, all right?

31:23.047 --> 31:25.008
And I'll talk to you later. All right?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.593
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.263
So, uh, what do you like
to be called? Mr. Wolf?

32:31.741 --> 32:33.952
The door was open.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.496
You're in the wrong room.
Are you stupid or something?

32:37.580 --> 32:39.999
- You probably think I'm a lookie-loo.
- Just leave, hear me?

32:40.124 --> 32:42.752
- That way there won't be any trouble.
- I came to see the girl there.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.505
- I don't know who you are.
- I'm Andy's father.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.966
- Maybe I should have called first?
- Andy.

32:48.174 --> 32:51.719
Yeah, you see, it's been a lousy day.
I thought I might brighten it up

32:51.719 --> 32:54.347
with a get-acquainted call
on my son's fiancée.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.266
Oh, my God. Mr. Sipowicz.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.936
I can imagine what you're thinking.

33:00.269 --> 33:02.480
I was thinking
you might wanna put some panties on.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.151
I've been so looking forward
to meeting you.

33:07.902 --> 33:11.030
Andy's told me so much about you.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.909
- This looks bad, doesn't it?
- You generally wear a bra?

33:15.368 --> 33:18.621
I want you to be clear this here is not
what it looks like here on the surface.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.208
This is supposed to be our last meeting.
Say goodbye forever.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.252
Patty started crying. I was crying.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.545
- Yeah.
- I took her in my arms.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.507
See, what we had, Kevin and I, it's over.

33:29.757 --> 33:33.636
You see,
I've come to realize...

33:34.137 --> 33:35.722
just how much I love your son.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.516
My loneliness,

33:39.142 --> 33:42.353
and my affection for Kevin,
it brought us together,

33:42.687 --> 33:44.564
but it's not enough to keep us together.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.442
Not alongside how I feel about Andy.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.570
I think under the circumstances
it might be best for me to leave.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.448
Hey, look. I don't know, uh,
I don't know if you rent this room

33:53.573 --> 33:54.866
by the hour or what,

33:55.116 --> 33:57.910
but what I gotta say won't take long,
so you just stick around.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.663
It's, um, it's gettin'...
it's gettin' kinda late.

34:00.663 --> 34:01.831
I should be getting home anyway.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.127
I think you better stick around.
You see, Patty's engagement just broke up.

34:06.335 --> 34:09.213
Now, she might need some older,
more experienced guy like you

34:09.213 --> 34:13.092
to... to help comfort her
when she faces unfamiliar emotions, see?

34:13.217 --> 34:15.970
I've had a pretty unhappy life
and I've made some mistakes.

34:17.847 --> 34:21.017
This may be one of the biggest,
but try to understand.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.811
Once Andy and I get settled
into our own place,

34:24.353 --> 34:26.606
I know I'll be a good wife to him.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.609
This part of my life is over.

34:30.401 --> 34:32.737
I'm four months pregnant.

34:33.154 --> 34:36.115
You've been seeing Andy
for the last three months now, huh?

34:36.324 --> 34:38.076
So, let's pretend we're grown-up here.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.661
Is that so important when two people
care for each other?

34:40.661 --> 34:43.164
Yeah, it is.
So, you're gonna tell Andy

34:43.289 --> 34:45.291
whatever you need to tell him
to cut him loose.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.502
You don't know
what you are asking me to do.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.712
I'm not askin'. It's how it's gonna be.

34:50.546 --> 34:52.381
Or else I'm gonna see
what kind of parents you have,

34:52.632 --> 34:53.841
then I'm gonna see his wife,

34:53.841 --> 34:55.551
and if things don't get straightened out
that way,

34:55.760 --> 34:57.136
then I'm gonna have to get serious.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.347
- Let's be rational about this.
- Shut up!

35:03.226 --> 35:04.602
I'm gonna need some money.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.688
I made plans.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.695
Here's 700 bucks.

35:15.696 --> 35:17.990
I don't wanna hear
how you're gonna spend it.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.257
- Are you the sarge?
- Yeah.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.008
We picked this guy up
at the Port Authority

35:36.008 --> 35:37.343
off a bus from Hackensack.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.387
Your detective squad wants
to talk to him about a case.

35:41.472 --> 35:45.268
Gimme Sipowicz.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.938
You wanna help me with this thing,
Freddy, don't ya?

35:49.230 --> 35:50.231
Yes.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.817
Put yourself in this boy's parents' place.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.486
- You can imagine how they're feeling.
- Sure.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.825
Kids in the neighborhood
say you hang around with them?

36:01.742 --> 36:04.662
Oh, I'm just friends
with a lot of them, you know.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.295
Freddy, we're gonna take
your fingerprints.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.339
And we're gonna compare 'em
with the fingerprints

36:15.339 --> 36:17.133
we took off that boy's body,

36:17.383 --> 36:19.552
and if they match up,
it's all over for you.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.804
I'm just friends with them.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.892
Were you drinking yesterday, Freddy?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.228
I drank some beer.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.274
Do you get urges when you're drinkin'
and feelings overcome you?

36:33.983 --> 36:35.401
I'm just friends.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.697
Freddy, did you have sex on that boy?

36:41.282 --> 36:43.034
And then you didn't want him to talk.

36:43.743 --> 36:44.994
Is that what happened yesterday?

36:46.245 --> 36:50.416
We only talked about Poland.
He's from Poland, you know,

36:50.416 --> 36:54.503
and I wanted him to drink some beer,
but he didn't like it.

36:54.503 --> 36:57.381
And I told him you never like it at first.

36:59.008 --> 37:00.176
Did you make him drink it?

37:02.011 --> 37:05.848
I... I only made him drink it
till he passed out, like,

37:05.848 --> 37:08.267
and, um, his eyes closed.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.896
I know this has gotta
be tearing you up inside...

37:13.356 --> 37:15.858
but you're gonna feel a lot better
if you just tell the truth.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.906
Did you have sex on him?

37:23.032 --> 37:26.077
Yeah.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.331
Yeah?

37:31.749 --> 37:34.752
Yeah. Um, I...

37:35.461 --> 37:37.088
I... He opened his eyes,

37:37.755 --> 37:41.133
and he... he started crying and...

37:41.550 --> 37:44.178
and then he... he started screamin' and

37:44.720 --> 37:50.893
I... I put my hands on his neck
to keep him from screaming and...

37:52.270 --> 37:55.481
that's when I knew that he was gonna tell.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.404
I know I got a problem.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.824
I should get treatment, huh?

38:14.959 --> 38:16.210
The lineup's set, Detective.

38:19.588 --> 38:20.965
- Get him.
- Right, Detective.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.582
Lou, there's six guys in there
with numbers on.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.293
Take it easy.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.462
I want you to look in there.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.048
If you recognize anybody,
you tell me his number, okay?

39:02.882 --> 39:03.883
Go ahead.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.519
Do you recognize anybody, Lou?

39:21.400 --> 39:22.401
Number one.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.863
Where do you know
number one from?

39:27.698 --> 39:28.824
Under the bridge.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.161
He's the guy that killed the other guy.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.704
You're certain?

39:34.580 --> 39:37.541
You'll say this on a stand when I ask you
if this should come to trial?

39:38.709 --> 39:39.752
Go ahead, Lou.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.006
Number one.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.472
You've given me an eyewitness
and a murder weapon.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.808
Plus, we got the lab report.
We can try and dig something up

39:53.933 --> 39:56.602
in the drug relationship
between this guy and the victim.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.729
Normally, I would be
very happy with the package,

39:58.729 --> 40:00.773
but in this instance,
I am a little concerned.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.818
- In the area of?
- Does it need saying, Detective Kelly?

40:03.943 --> 40:06.821
My chief witness thinks
that he is a furry carnivore.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.447
Okay, let me tell you something
about Louie.

40:08.447 --> 40:11.659
- He has his ways, but down deep...
- He's a stand-up wolf.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.578
You got the housing authorization?

40:15.121 --> 40:16.455
- Yes.
- Thank you.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.128
It's gonna be safe
living under the bridge now.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.921
Livin' under the bridge
ain't gonna make it, Lou.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.549
Here's 50 dollars. I want you to go
to the "Y" and get cleaned up,

40:26.549 --> 40:29.218
and then go to an Army Navy store
and get some new clothes, okay?

40:29.343 --> 40:30.970
Do you know where the Collingwood Arms is?

40:30.970 --> 40:33.222
Okay, the DA is gonna
have you stay there for a while.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.809
A big wolf gratitude.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.603
Your own lair, Lou. Go ahead. Take him.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.648
- All right, Lou.
- You all right, man?

40:42.648 --> 40:44.900
Yeah. Uh, Freddy signed.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.986
Yeah. You want me to go over
and tell the parents?

40:47.236 --> 40:48.654
- We'll go together.
- All right.

40:50.698 --> 40:51.740
Hey. Give me a minute?

40:54.702 --> 40:56.704
Called your house last night.
You didn't pick up.

40:57.496 --> 41:00.082
- Yeah, I was with my ex-wife.
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.377
Anything else you wanna ask me?

41:04.420 --> 41:05.754
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.799
That's not what it was about.
It is over between me and her.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.551
All right.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.512
But I'd like to see you tonight.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.639
All right.

41:16.682 --> 41:17.725
Call you later?

41:42.249 --> 41:43.292
Hello, detectives.

41:44.376 --> 41:45.377
Hi, Mr. Wentz.

41:47.463 --> 41:50.299
Came by to tell you
that we arrested someone

41:50.299 --> 41:52.885
for what they did to your son,
and we got a full confession.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.929
Rudolf, show them!

41:56.555 --> 41:57.890
Detectives, please, come!

41:59.308 --> 42:00.351
Would you mind?

42:05.564 --> 42:08.067
She's been there all day.
She's very upset.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.117
At the top of the building,
do you see that?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.080
- See what, Mrs. Wentz?
- That white bird.

42:22.039 --> 42:25.084
It came to us yesterday.
The day that Rudy died.

42:26.877 --> 42:27.878
Do you see it?

42:30.506 --> 42:31.507
Yes, ma'am.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.843
It hasn't left the building.
It just... it just stays there.

42:38.097 --> 42:39.348
Do you see a light from it?

42:41.225 --> 42:43.978
There is something there maybe.

42:46.272 --> 42:47.356
Do you see it too?

42:51.068 --> 42:52.194
That's a beautiful bird.

42:54.363 --> 42:57.157
We believe, Inga and I...

42:58.617 --> 43:00.411
that it is Rudy's spirit.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.164
That he is staying with us, you see.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.292
You know, he's come as a bird,

43:06.709 --> 43:09.169
to let us know
that he is all right in his soul.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.842
I think there is a light there
coming out of him.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.161
- Hi.
- Hey.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.413
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.878
You know what? Wait awhile on that.

43:51.545 --> 43:52.671
Wait on... wait on that.

43:53.839 --> 43:56.842
Are we, uh,
are we square on last night?

43:57.009 --> 43:58.969
- Yeah. Yeah, we're square.
- Yeah.

43:59.637 --> 44:00.846
All right. Because, um...

44:02.097 --> 44:04.308
I wanna... I wanna put in
whatever we have to

44:05.059 --> 44:07.227
on this, uh, you know, the two of us.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.314
- Take this as far as we can.
- Okay.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.566
- You up for that?
- Yeah.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.402
- I wanna try.
- Yeah.

44:16.695 --> 44:18.989
Good.

44:23.285 --> 44:24.411
You wanna pin me?

44:25.245 --> 44:27.456
Give me your lavaliere or something?

44:41.720 --> 44:44.014
Guess we're tied, huh?

44:46.517 --> 44:47.518
Yeah.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.523
Yeah. Come here.

45:27.850 --> 45:28.851
What do you want?

45:30.018 --> 45:31.103
I wanna talk to you.

45:31.770 --> 45:34.106
Patty told me it wasn't my baby.

45:35.190 --> 45:38.277
That, uh... that she was getting
an abortion.

45:38.652 --> 45:40.195
She's not gonna marry me.

45:42.197 --> 45:45.576
She didn't say I was a fool,
but she was just being polite.

45:45.868 --> 45:46.869
You're not a fool.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.748
You think you did me a favor, don't you?

45:51.415 --> 45:52.583
Well, I loved her,

45:53.500 --> 45:55.919
and you don't know
what would have happened down the road,

45:56.086 --> 45:58.130
and now I'm never gonna know either.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.429
I've been a lousy father, Andy...

46:07.931 --> 46:09.266
but I always loved you.

46:10.225 --> 46:12.561
And when I could,
I always tried to look out for you.

46:13.270 --> 46:17.733
You threw a damn grenade into my life.
Is that the best you could come up with?

46:19.067 --> 46:22.613
I don't know.
There's no rules in being a father.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.242
I hate you, Dad.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.831
It's better you should hate me
than screw up your life.

46:33.540 --> 46:36.460
You got a lot of things to do yet.
I want you to do 'em better than me.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.591
I want you to be a better father than me.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.177
I'm pretty confident about that.

46:46.553 --> 46:47.596
I am too.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.099
I wish I would have
prepared you better, Andy.

46:52.142 --> 46:54.061
I wish I could have thought
of a better way to handle this,

46:54.061 --> 46:55.187
but I didn't.

46:57.064 --> 47:00.275
I know that I love you
and that I do the best I can.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.655
I gotta pray that
that's gonna be good enough.

47:18.126 --> 47:19.211
I'll see you around, huh?
