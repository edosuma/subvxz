- Cowboys?
- Cowboys?

00:22.564 --> 00:25.733
Yes, fine, you're free to go
watch the game. Go on.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.527
[sighs]

00:27.569 --> 00:29.279
[Fran] Mom, you barely
touched your food.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.615
The turkey was dry, even the
cranberry sauce couldn't save it.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.952
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.997
- You good?
- Yes, I'm good.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.583
Fran, this was a lovely meal,
thank you so much.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.336
I'm so glad someone
appreciates it.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.131
How about you?
You about ready to head out?

00:48.173 --> 00:49.757
You want to leave now?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.760
Well, I have this work
call later tonight,

00:51.801 --> 00:54.155
and I wanted to spend a little
time with just us beforehand.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.848
I thought that we could go
for a walk out in the garden.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.807
Dad put the lights up.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.810
He's a busy man, Olivia.
You understand.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.438
No... Yeah, that's fine.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.566
Of course we can take a walk
around the garden.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.984
- It'll be nice.
- Okay.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.028
I'm going to go do the dishes.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.446
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.285
Mom, it's Thanksgiving.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.287
He shouldn't be working
on Thanksgiving,

01:20.288 --> 01:22.123
and you shouldn't encourage it.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.500
Oh, honey, lighten up!

01:23.541 --> 01:25.001
He said he'd take a walk
with you.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.588
And anyway, maybe his work thing
is really you.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.310
[whispering]
What is that supposed to mean?

01:30.340 --> 01:33.093
[whispering] You just celebrated
your one-year anniversary!

01:33.134 --> 01:35.404
[Fran] Don't you think he has
something else planned tonight?

01:35.428 --> 01:37.013
Like what?

01:37.055 --> 01:39.891
Oh, I don't know, maybe a six-karat
cushion cut stocking stuffer

01:39.933 --> 01:43.436
that he spent his entire
Christmas bonus on just for you.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.980
- No.
- I'm just saying.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.692
[Livvy] I bet you never thought
that...

01:49.734 --> 01:52.986
you would create your own
app and be the head CEO

01:52.987 --> 01:57.158
of your... own company
in less than six years?

01:57.200 --> 01:59.827
No, I did not.

01:59.828 --> 02:04.290
[sighs] It's crazy...
But that's life, isn't it?

02:04.332 --> 02:06.626
Things... changing all the time.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.586
Yeah.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.357
But I think that everything
that's been happening

02:11.381 --> 02:12.632
for both of us,

02:12.674 --> 02:14.759
I think that, you know,
change is a good thing.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.428
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.723
- With change comes growth, right?
- Yes, right.

02:22.392 --> 02:26.062
Okay, well, there's something that I
really want to talk to you about.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.566
And... I mean, we've been dating
for what? Almost a year?

02:29.607 --> 02:32.610
November 28th will be a year.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.739
Right. Yeah... Um.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.076
So, well, since it's been
almost a year...

02:41.035 --> 02:43.454
I've been doing
a lot of thinking...

02:43.496 --> 02:46.833
And you know how deeply
I care about you, right?

02:48.918 --> 02:51.921
And... [clears his throat]
And that's why...

02:53.798 --> 02:55.675
I can't keep this going,

02:55.717 --> 02:58.219
between us, knowing that
ultimately in my heart,

02:58.261 --> 03:01.723
you and I just aren't quite
right for each other.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.058
- What?
- And I know this is bad timing

03:05.059 --> 03:07.687
with Thanksgiving and
your family and all, and,

03:07.729 --> 03:10.356
believe me, I wanted to wait
until after the holidays, I did.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.691
But I... [sighs]

03:11.733 --> 03:13.794
I just did not think that
was going to be fair to you.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.738
You're... breaking up with me?

03:16.779 --> 03:19.532
No... Baby, come on.
Don't put it like that.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.951
I thought you were going
to propose to me.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.080
Oh... Wow.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.917
I'm so sorry.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.086
I really do care
about you, Livvy, but marriage...

03:32.128 --> 03:33.671
- Surprise!
- Congrats!

Hey. Can we get up now?

who makes your morning
Christmas mint latte

Holiday Happy Hour,

I haven't even put down
the deposit on the teahouse,

05:27.994 --> 05:30.037

05:30.038 --> 05:32.372
It's a good thing
your trusty assistant

05:32.373 --> 05:33.708
was on top of things.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.668
- Huh!
- Okay.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.713
But we still have a party to throw today,
so please get up and get showered.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.507
- Now?
- Yes, now!

05:41.549 --> 05:43.384
Chocolate-covered caramel corn?

05:43.426 --> 05:46.846
Girl, get a grip.
No. Go, shower.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.351
Yeah, see,
nobody wants to see that.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.811
Now go... Vamonos. Come on.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.272
- Okay, I'm going.
- Step over the pillow. Come on.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.903
[women chattering, giggling]

06:01.944 --> 06:04.572
It's so good to see you.
Livvy...

06:04.614 --> 06:06.907
You've done an amazing job.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.452
But all matching snow bunny
boots for the exchange?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.829
I mean, that's kind
of a risky bet, wasn't it?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.080
But thanks to you,

06:13.081 --> 06:15.083
when our husbands drag us
to Aspen this year,

06:15.124 --> 06:18.920
we won't have to fight over who
wore them first, so cheers to that.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.173
Oh my gosh. Can I give your card

06:22.215 --> 06:23.966
to my husband's boss
at his firm?

06:24.008 --> 06:25.194
I know
their normal party planner.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.779
He's actually a little
under the weather,

06:26.803 --> 06:29.596
- and they have this big New Year's Eve's bash.
- Thank you.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.099
But I'm actually going
through a break...

06:32.100 --> 06:36.104
So it's actually perfect timing.
Thank you that would be amazing.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.315
Okay, I'm going to go mingle.
So, do what you do. [giggles]

06:40.733 --> 06:43.778
- Umm!
- What? You heard her.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.405
She told me earlier

06:45.446 --> 06:48.074
that they'd be offering 15 G's
just for your commission alone!

06:48.116 --> 06:50.410
And the nine pairs
of matching boots?

06:50.451 --> 06:51.786
It worked, didn't it?

06:51.828 --> 06:54.705
And besides, I was running myself
ragged at the office last week.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.791
It's not like I had any help.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.627
I'm sorry. You did a great job.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.462
- Okay, thank you.
- Who knows?

07:01.504 --> 07:05.299
What if this New Year's gig is the
turn of a whole new tea leaf?

07:05.341 --> 07:09.887
Maybe some handsome,
grounded, young bachelor,

07:09.929 --> 07:12.074
who donates his holiday bonus
to the Red Cross every year,

07:12.098 --> 07:14.141
shows up destined
to meet with you.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.520
With a hot, closeted
twin brother?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.397
[whispers] Exactly.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.524
You know what? You're right.
You're right.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.068
This New Year's going to be
a whole new start for me.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.319
Next time Anderson sees me,
he's going to be sad and alone,

07:26.320 --> 07:28.698
and I'm going to be with
someone even better.

07:28.739 --> 07:29.991
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.494
[spits]

07:33.536 --> 07:34.661
- What?
- Nothing.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.663
- What just happened?
- Nothing.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.748
[gasps]

07:37.790 --> 07:40.001
[laughs] Come here!

07:41.335 --> 07:42.378
[Livvy gasps]

07:43.379 --> 07:44.464
Oh, okay. Thanks.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.549
- You scared me. Oh my gosh.
- I'll let you go.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.136
Oh my God.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.513
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.893
Whoa, Livvy! Just put down the
cupcake and let's talk about this.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.186
[mumbles] That big fat cheater!

07:59.187 --> 08:01.105
Maybe he just started
seeing her?

08:02.607 --> 08:03.709
You're right, he's a cheater.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.359
How could I not know
he was a cheater?

08:05.401 --> 08:06.693
You know what?

08:06.694 --> 08:08.714
I should go down there and tell
that child that he's a jerk.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.366
Before he takes her back for what
clearly is a 10 p.m. curfew.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.618
Okay!

08:13.659 --> 08:16.829
If you wanna come across looking
like a psychotic stalker ex.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.872
Unleash the beast, Tyler!

08:18.873 --> 08:20.333
Livvy, if you want revenge,

08:20.374 --> 08:23.544
just blast his past all over
the Web for the world to see.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.632
True revenge is a dish
best served over social media.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.300
What are you
talking about? Dish?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.635
Rateyourex.com?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.905
It's that site where people go
to complain about their exes.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.405
[muttering]
And how do you know all this?

08:34.429 --> 08:37.517
I always do rigorous background
checks on my paramours.

08:37.558 --> 08:41.770
How else would I know about all their
favorite movies and music before I meet them?

08:41.812 --> 08:43.063
All the girls are doing it.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.249
How have you not heard
about this?

08:44.273 --> 08:46.066
Because you're my only
girlfriend, Ty.

08:46.067 --> 08:50.403
And I can't just blast Anderson on a
website for the whole world to see.

08:50.404 --> 08:55.075
Why not? He publicly humiliated
you in front of your family.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.744
You even said your mom sent you
home with a plate of leftovers

08:57.745 --> 08:59.664
labelled
"Livvy Hearts Anderson."

08:59.705 --> 09:01.332
I say, out his sorry butt.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.126
Because even if I did,
he would know it was me.

09:04.168 --> 09:07.754
And then I would be
Livvy the loony ex.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.215
Not if you're not the first one.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.425
No, no. This was
an isolated incident

09:12.426 --> 09:14.929
because he thought
we were getting too serious.

09:14.971 --> 09:20.268
He got scared and dated some thing
that he cares nothing for. Okay?

09:20.309 --> 09:22.520
[laughs] Okay.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.439
Whatever keeps those sugar plums
dancing in your head at night, dear.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.607
[giggles] Hi.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.527
Hi.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.204
[typing]

09:48.963 --> 09:51.215
[phone vibrates]

09:52.550 --> 09:55.136
Livvy, put down the wine.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.138
Put down the barbell, Ty.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.472
[Livvy] Listen, you were right.
I went to that site,

09:59.473 --> 10:03.603
and two of his exes had just posted
there and they were just the locals.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.981
I'm not going to say I told
you so, but I told you so.

10:07.023 --> 10:12.152
So, I'm actually meeting PrincessPie82
and Fitigator for coffee tomorrow.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.988
Princess what and Fit-n-gay who?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.989
The girls Anderson dumped
right before me.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.283
I messaged them,

10:17.325 --> 10:19.993
and they agreed
to meet me for coffee!

10:19.994 --> 10:23.456
But you don't know the first
thing about these girls.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.542
Well, I know that Anderson broke their
heart just as much as he did mine.

10:26.584 --> 10:31.130
So, then, expose his cheating in your
story, that's what the site is for, Livvy.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.506
[Livvy] No, no.
A testimonial is not enough.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.010
I mean, What if this next girl
doesn't see it? I didn't.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.806
I need to know why he does this,
why he keeps doing this.

10:40.848 --> 10:43.059
Because he's a jerk, Livvy.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.352
[Ty] And sometimes
there is no reason.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.314
I gave him a year of my life.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.483
Okay, I need to have
some kind of resolution,

10:50.524 --> 10:53.819
and I think these girls
might be able to help.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.613
[sighs] Just be careful.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.198
You don't know if these girls
are total whack jobs.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.533
[Livvy] They dated Anderson.

10:59.575 --> 11:04.204
They're clearly as stable
and sane as I am. [giggles]

11:04.205 --> 11:05.665
[Ty] Go to bed, Livvy.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.502
Ty?

11:09.543 --> 11:11.170
Ty?

11:23.307 --> 11:25.892
Hi. You must be Murphy McCall.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.145
And you must be Olivia.
You're late.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.730
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I normally bill out at 350 an hour.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.525
Two minutes is 12 bucks,
Ms. Beal.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.277
Can I buy you a coffee?

11:35.319 --> 11:37.506
I don't like to owe anyone
anything, so it will be my treat.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.657
What about the other girl?
Is she coming, or...?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.493
Well, she just texted and said
she's running late, but...

11:42.535 --> 11:44.805
Okay, if I don't get caffeine
in me in the next few minutes,

11:44.829 --> 11:47.790
everyone within reaching distance
is going to pay. Shall we?

11:51.001 --> 11:54.046
Welcome to the Toasty Roast. Happy
holidays. What can I do for you?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.089
I'll have a double shot

11:55.131 --> 11:57.091
with a splash of non-fat.
Thanks.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.970
Hi! Are you Livvy?

12:01.011 --> 12:03.097
Zoe! So nice to meet you.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.266
Sorry, I have to go
to work after this

12:05.307 --> 12:06.434
and curse this corset,

12:06.475 --> 12:08.102
I just couldn't get
it on tight enough.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.688
But wow, it's so nice
to finally meet you!

12:10.730 --> 12:13.023
Wait, finally? How long have
you two been talking?

12:13.065 --> 12:15.985
Oh, I just meant, since we've
all shared in the same tragedy,

12:16.026 --> 12:18.404
that's like unspoken sisterhood
in my book.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.448
A book I'm sure
comes fully illustrated.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.283
And you must be
our other sister!

12:23.284 --> 12:24.910
I'm pretty sure
I'm an only child,

12:24.952 --> 12:27.496
but Murphy, nice to meet you.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.832
So do Santa's helpers
include 10 maids-a-milkin'

12:29.874 --> 12:31.124
now at the mall?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.002
[Zoe] Oh, the mall? No, no.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.670
I am a working actress,

12:34.712 --> 12:36.547
at Party Princess.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.465
The place they rent out
for birthdays?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.509
Mm-hmm. I play
a storybook maiden,

12:40.551 --> 12:43.846
and then after the cake,
I'm enchanted into a princess.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.140
Sounds like a great job.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.477
[Murphy] Okay, let's get
the facts straight.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.313
So, you are saying that you
randomly saw Anderson

12:52.354 --> 12:54.814
get into his car last night
with some... girl,

12:54.815 --> 12:57.276
and that's the proof
that he cheated on all of us?

12:57.318 --> 12:58.652
Yes.

12:58.694 --> 13:03.157
No. I don't really know,
but something doesn't add up.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.657
When I think about him,
I still get stressed,

13:04.658 --> 13:06.869
and when I get stressed,
I'm an emotional eater.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.789
[Murphy] Look, your theory
is absurd.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.540
I can smell a liar a mile away.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.960
I know, I smell that way.
I'm a litigator.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.713
Now, was I upset when Anderson
dumped me

13:17.755 --> 13:20.508
ten months after his company
settled a court case

13:20.549 --> 13:23.177
that they outsourced me for?
Yes!

13:23.219 --> 13:24.362
But the only reason he did that

13:24.386 --> 13:26.472
was because he was falling
so deeply for me

13:26.514 --> 13:28.641
and he couldn't handle
those feelings.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.184
Not because he met her.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.477
No offense.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.853
That's what I thought,
but humor me one moment.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.189
When did you and Anderson
break up?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.650
I don't remember.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.878
I paid a therapist good money
to black out that entire year.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.695
Okay, well, the rant you posted
was on December 10th,

13:42.696 --> 13:43.906
three years ago.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.865
Was that the date
that you broke up?

13:45.866 --> 13:47.117
Give or take a few days, yes.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.244
[Livvy] Okay, Zoe.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.329
You posted on December 10th
a year ago.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.540
Do you remember the actual date
that you broke up?

13:52.581 --> 13:55.375
I remember it was
a particularly chilly day...

13:55.376 --> 13:57.711
The date, Zoe! The date!

13:57.753 --> 14:00.256
Sorry! December 2nd.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.133
That was a month after he hired
me for the holiday party,

14:03.175 --> 14:04.343
which means he was seeing me

14:04.385 --> 14:07.429
three weeks
before he dumped you.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.892
That...

14:11.934 --> 14:12.893
unbelievable...

14:12.935 --> 14:15.104
Two-timing, love-drunk swindler!

14:15.145 --> 14:16.729
Don't know how he does it.
I swear.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.108
It was that one-month
anniversary at Belvederes,

14:19.149 --> 14:20.734
I was hook, line, and...

14:21.861 --> 14:22.945
He took you there too?

14:26.156 --> 14:27.825
So what?

14:27.867 --> 14:31.161
So he cheated on me with
a party princess pizza server.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.997
It just is what it is,
and it's done.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.373
Where are you going?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.226
I'm going home, and I'm going
to call my therapist

14:36.250 --> 14:39.169
and ravel up all this crazy that
the two of you just unraveled.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.797
So, thank you very much, ladies.
Merry Christmas!

14:47.469 --> 14:49.096
[Livvy] Wait, Murphy!

14:49.138 --> 14:50.763
Don't you owe it
to this new girl

14:50.764 --> 14:53.099
to show her what a scumbag
Anderson really is?

14:53.100 --> 14:54.434
I don't owe that girl a thing.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.935
Don't you owe it to yourself?

14:55.936 --> 14:58.856
I mean, if you could go back
and see through his tricks,

14:58.898 --> 15:01.233
your favorite flowers delivered
on the first Friday

15:01.275 --> 15:02.609
of every month.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.237
Or the way he would leave
little notes on the refrigerator

15:05.279 --> 15:06.447
feigning excitement

15:06.488 --> 15:08.008
for the wonderful weekend
he has planned for us.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.343
Or how he would wait until the
lights go down in the theater

15:10.367 --> 15:11.827
before offering you
a red licorice

15:11.869 --> 15:14.455
with half of it dangling out of
his mouth about to kiss you!

15:15.998 --> 15:20.044
If you had a chance to see his
wolf eyes under all that fleece,

15:20.085 --> 15:21.712
I mean, wouldn't you take it?

15:22.963 --> 15:24.130
So what do you want us to do?

15:24.131 --> 15:25.798
You want us to go meet this girl

15:25.799 --> 15:28.385
and unravel all of our crazy
onto her?

15:28.427 --> 15:30.429
No. No crazy exes here.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.805
I devised an even better plan

15:31.847 --> 15:34.516
to get even with Mr. Whitmire
this holiday season.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.770
It went off in my head last
night like a bright red bulb.

15:37.811 --> 15:41.065
Oh! Can we call it
"Operation: Rudolph's Revenge"?

15:41.106 --> 15:42.815
Yay! Okay,
what are we going to do?

15:42.816 --> 15:44.610
[Livvy] We pray on his
weaknesses around her.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.487
We show his true natures' self

15:46.528 --> 15:48.489
without them even knowing
we were there.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.199
So how do you propose
that we do that?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.867
Who knows Anderson
better than we do?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.160
Who has a key to his place?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.037
Knows every meticulous routine
to a tee

15:55.079 --> 15:56.288
and knows how afraid he gets

15:56.330 --> 15:58.165
when things don't go according
to plan.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.832
I venture to say
that the three of us

15:59.833 --> 16:02.336
knows every ploy
he's willing to pull.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.255
And if we can just stay
one hoof in front of him,

16:05.297 --> 16:06.757
I can assure you

16:06.799 --> 16:09.677
there will be no Whitmire
for the win this holiday season.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.805
Who's with me?

16:12.846 --> 16:15.265
Code name Cupid Claus,
reporting for duty!

16:15.307 --> 16:17.893
And Rudolph has never been more
ready for revenge.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.770
What about you, Vixen?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.063
You out, or you in?

16:22.439 --> 16:23.565
Let's put triple exes

16:23.607 --> 16:26.360
all over his holiday
greeting card this year.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.467
I could be at a holiday
happy hour right now.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.742
Where is this guy?

16:35.035 --> 16:36.453
There he is.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.289
Tyler, meet Zoe and Murphy.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.418
And Izzy Wizzy Wuzzy Pup.

16:42.459 --> 16:46.212
Hi, ladies, and Izzy Wuzzy.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.506
[Livvy] Okay, so tell me.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.049
The flowers were delivered
to Anderson's office.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.384
What?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.721
Why? That's impossible.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.055
I know, but that's where the
courier took his 3:30 delivery.

16:56.056 --> 17:00.102
He is probably delivering
the flowers to her himself.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.645
Well, so much for Plan A, guys.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.856
This has been
a colossal waste of time.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.608
Maybe she works there too.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.279
What?

17:10.319 --> 17:11.739
Zoe's right.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.366
She works there.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.077
It makes sense.
She's a holiday intern.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.913
- Oh that...
- [Livvy] You know what?

17:20.914 --> 17:23.834
Murphy, this could work
in our favor.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.877
This is a good thing.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.927
[Tyler] What are you doing?
I thought you said,

17:28.964 --> 17:30.942
you were just going to write
a note and be done with it.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.969
Nope. Girls, we're going
to make an anonymous basket

17:34.011 --> 17:36.096
for Anderson come first thing
Monday morning.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.392
What do you want to put in it?

17:42.102 --> 17:43.269
[Murphy] So what's the plan?

17:43.270 --> 17:44.771
You guys hang tight.
When lunch arrives,

17:44.772 --> 17:47.399
Anderson will retreat
to his office as per usual,

17:47.441 --> 17:51.612
and I will deliver his Christmas
basket to his temp.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.115
Oh, that'll be lunch.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.035
I hope Anderson's cold-cut
is cold.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.454
I don't know what that means.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.706
Neither do I.

18:03.874 --> 18:04.958
Wish me luck!

18:09.296 --> 18:11.757
[inaudible office chatter]

18:14.051 --> 18:15.803
[office chatter]

18:24.269 --> 18:25.646
[woman] It was so cute!

18:25.687 --> 18:29.191
We were holding hands
for like half an hour.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.194
And then we went to this fabulous
little ice cream shop on Third.

18:32.236 --> 18:36.240
He ordered us two scoops of
strawberry balsamic to share.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.492
- That's so cute.
- Right?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.668
Can I help you with something?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.003
Hi.

18:51.004 --> 18:55.008
I was just admiring Anderson's
big, beautiful basket.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.178
Anderson's office
is down the hall.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.639
No, no, it's not.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.099
I'm pretty sure that it is.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.435
At least for the last two months
because this is my office now.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.896
Oh... Who are you?

19:07.938 --> 19:10.399
I work here. Shouldn't I be
asking you that question?

19:10.440 --> 19:13.068
Yeah, I am... I am...
[clears throat]

19:13.110 --> 19:14.862
[stammers] Olivia Beale.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.739
Ah. I am Carter.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.200
Bolton. I'm the new VP of
software development.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.496
Are you Anderson's lady friend?

19:24.538 --> 19:27.958
[scoffs] No.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.877
I just worked here last year
at the holiday party.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.380
Oh, yeah.
I heard it was a big hit.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.590
I'm a big hitter.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.757
[nervous laughter]

19:36.550 --> 19:38.010
[Carter clears throat]

19:38.051 --> 19:40.888
So... you said you just saw this
sitting here when you came in?

19:40.929 --> 19:42.115
You didn't see
who dropped it off?

19:42.139 --> 19:45.100
Right, and I think that
maybe it could be...

19:45.142 --> 19:47.686
[chuckles] There is no name.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.354
I wonder if I have
a secret admirer.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.898
Yeah, maybe.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.651
"You've been naughty this year."

19:58.697 --> 20:00.282
I know who this is from.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.844
So Anderson's not the only person
who needs a lump of coal brownies?

20:02.868 --> 20:05.913
Oh, were you digging around
in my basket?

20:08.582 --> 20:09.916
It was nice to meet you.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.128
- I'm going to go.
- Oh, okay.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.796
[screaming]

20:14.838 --> 20:16.255
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.925
I'm so sorry! Let me help you!

20:17.966 --> 20:20.385
It's all right.
I'm good, thank you.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.595
- Okay...
- I'm good.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.680
Okay, I'm so sorry.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.265
- Oh, wow. Cute shoes.
- Sorry.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.310
I'm so sorry.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.354
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.271
- Okay.
- Who's that?

20:32.272 --> 20:34.274
Oh, that's Anderson's
new assistant, Megan.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.776
She's a temp-to-hire.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.696
She's... really pretty.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.156
You seem a little jealous.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.993
I just think, she could be
an office distraction.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.120
Wow. Well, I mean,
if Anderson was discriminating

20:48.121 --> 20:50.457
against someone
for being too pretty,

20:50.499 --> 20:52.292
he might not
have hired you either.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.670
[scoffs] Yeah.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.462
You know what?

20:56.463 --> 20:59.508
Here is my card, Ms. Beal.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.468
If by any chance you would be
interested, I...

21:01.510 --> 21:05.597
In a date with you?
Just... probably not.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.849
No.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.976
No, I was actually just going
to ask if you could help me out

21:09.977 --> 21:11.579
with the holiday party
at the country club.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.873
I drew the short straw and I just
figured you've done it before...

21:13.897 --> 21:16.900
Yeah, I'm just...
kind of busy right now.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.820
Hence why Anderson probably
didn't mention my name.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.240
And you know it's going to be
a secret that I was here,

21:23.282 --> 21:27.660
so maybe if you like...
didn't mention it.

21:27.661 --> 21:31.081
Okay. Yeah, yeah sure.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.125
You know what? Why don't you
keep my card anyway

21:33.166 --> 21:34.167
just in case...

21:37.838 --> 21:38.839
Okay.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.341
So, how was it?

21:42.342 --> 21:45.095
Did she leave him red and
crumbling in tidal wave of tears

21:45.137 --> 21:46.846
in front of
the entire boardroom?

21:46.847 --> 21:48.932
Whoa! Do you need a back rub?

21:49.725 --> 21:51.059
He changed offices.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.894
So I delivered it
to the wrong office

21:52.936 --> 21:54.646
and his co-worker
ended up with it.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.542
And then his co-worker thought it was
from this girl he was with last night.

21:57.566 --> 22:01.111
I am... beyond words right now.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.112
Great.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.448
Well, that is another mandatory
vacation day

22:04.489 --> 22:06.491
wasted on Anderson Whitmire.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.618
So now what?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.662
His one-month anniversary
is coming up soon, right?

22:10.704 --> 22:11.872
That can only mean...

22:11.913 --> 22:13.206
- Belvedere's.
- Belvedere's!

22:13.248 --> 22:14.541
Exactly!

22:14.583 --> 22:16.543
A little booze,
a lot of witnesses...

22:16.585 --> 22:19.087
Sounds like a prime set-up
for sabotage!

22:19.129 --> 22:21.757
Okay. So what are
we going to do?

22:25.802 --> 22:27.262
I have an idea.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.889
What does Anderson hate
more than anything else

22:29.890 --> 22:31.391
during the holidays?

22:31.433 --> 22:32.726
Feel-good music.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.102
Fruit cake!

22:34.144 --> 22:35.144
No.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.741
Jeez. That's him?

22:48.742 --> 22:51.244
You guys missed a great show.

22:51.286 --> 22:55.665
Beau? Livvy and Murphy. Guys?
Meet Santa.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.667
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

22:57.709 --> 22:59.544
Ain't he cute?

22:59.586 --> 23:03.423
Well, I hope you have an Oscar-caliber
Santa hiding somewhere in those slippers.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.760
Okay, how do I look?

23:07.761 --> 23:10.305
- You look just like Santa!
- Perfect.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.973
Oh, hey!

23:12.015 --> 23:13.892
- You look so good!
- Yes!

23:13.934 --> 23:15.352
We just contacted Belvedere's.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.728
They have a 7 p.m. reservation,

23:16.770 --> 23:18.938
and they'll be leaving
anytime now.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.708
He's going to do whatever he can
not to pay you,

23:20.732 --> 23:23.235
so you need to not give in
without a fight. Okay?

23:23.276 --> 23:25.654
All good, ladies.
I am a trained professional.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.113
So remember, just look for the...

23:27.114 --> 23:29.574
Flax-haired hottie with a smile
you can snack on for days.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.511
- I got it.
- Okay, are we don't with this little powwow,

23:31.535 --> 23:34.286
'cause it's 6:30, and he's going
to be coming down any minute.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.621
Okay?

23:35.622 --> 23:36.957
Good luck!

23:38.417 --> 23:40.419
[bell chiming]

23:44.464 --> 23:45.799
[Megan] That's not true.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.777
- Well, it might be. It could be.
- I feel like it's not, though.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.469
Well, hey.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.972
Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas, kids.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.808
Aren't you too sweet?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.144
You look a little young
to play Santa, huh?

23:57.185 --> 23:58.270
Ho ho ho!

23:58.311 --> 24:00.479
Never too young
to help out the homeless.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.773
A few pennies for the poor?

24:01.815 --> 24:03.775
All proceeds go
to the local shelter.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.820
[Megan] Yes, absolutely.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.989
There you go! [clears throat]

24:09.030 --> 24:11.783
- Babe.
- 'Tis the season to be giving.

24:11.825 --> 24:12.951
[Megan clears throat]

24:12.993 --> 24:15.162
Sorry, man.
I don't have any more cash.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.122
[Megan]
But you always have cash.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.290
Not tonight.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.666
Well, how were you going to tip
the valet?

24:20.667 --> 24:23.169
Hey, it's all good.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.338
I get it. Money is tight
around the holidays.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.424
You don't have the money.
I don't judge.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.050
Are you even legit, man?

24:29.092 --> 24:31.928
You don't exactly look like
a charity Santa to me.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.347
I may not be the real Santa...

24:34.389 --> 24:36.349
but I am one of
Santa's little helpers.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.664
Okay, look, man, we have a dinner
reservation at seven o'clock,

24:41.688 --> 24:43.916
so I don't really have time for
this, but I'll tell you what.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.193
You show up on Monday wearing
your cute little outfit,

24:46.234 --> 24:49.571
and I'll bring some cash,
and I'll throw you a 20. Okay?

24:49.613 --> 24:52.032
[Megan coughs]

24:52.073 --> 24:53.283
No cash?

24:54.868 --> 24:57.621
Well, I guess I forgot
I went to the ATM last night.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.872
- It was so late.
- Of course!

24:59.873 --> 25:03.585
Short-term memory loss
is rampant this day and age.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.295
[Megan clears throat]

25:05.337 --> 25:06.880
Two hundred dollars.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.257
- Wow, thank you.
- Oh, okay.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.384
[Megan] Don't worry about it.
It's not hurting him.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.345
Plus, the shelter needs it
more than he does.

25:13.386 --> 25:14.679
Right.

25:14.721 --> 25:15.805
Merry Christmas to you.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.182
Bless you.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.560
Okay.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.147
Homeless shelter, let's see...

25:26.775 --> 25:29.486
Thirteen hundred bucks.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.322
That ought to feed the charity
through the new year, yeah?

25:34.074 --> 25:38.703
Look, man, I'm sorry,
but I have been scammed before.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.790
And, well, I guess
you're legit, right?

25:41.831 --> 25:45.043
You are the real deal? You're going
to send me a receipt for this?

25:45.085 --> 25:47.754
Sure. Yeah. No problem.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.589
Yeah, okay. Good.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.551
That was really sweet.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.552
Well, what can I say?

25:53.593 --> 25:56.221
Sometimes I have a soft spot
for the homeless.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.181
[Megan laughs]

26:02.185 --> 26:04.271
Sorry, guys.
That dude's a charmer.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.481
I can't believe he shelled out
1,300 hundred bucks

26:06.523 --> 26:07.857
for some holiday intern.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.609
She's like an after-school special
that knows how to have fun.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.070
It is disgusting!

26:15.073 --> 26:17.158
Well, at least we helped feed
the homeless.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.119
Yeah, but now he looks like
some good Samaritan

26:19.160 --> 26:23.415
instead of some two-timing pile
of reindeer patties

26:23.456 --> 26:24.708
he really is.

26:24.749 --> 26:25.791
It's not use. YOU know what?

26:25.792 --> 26:27.252
She's young and she's naive,

26:27.294 --> 26:28.961
and she's only going to see
what she wants to see.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.965
Well, you know what? You know what
she's going to see tomorrow night?

26:32.007 --> 26:34.467
Anderson Whitmire
at his absolute worst.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.220
Yeah.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.182
Bye!

26:45.979 --> 26:48.315
Livvy, are you decent?

26:51.526 --> 26:52.444
Livvy, what are you doing?

26:52.485 --> 26:53.921
This is what
plastic surgeons are for.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.697
Shut up!
I can't look like myself.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.533
I'm ruining Anderson's date
with the girl he's with tonight!

26:58.575 --> 27:02.412
Have you completely forgotten about
our meeting with Lila Croft today?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.080
You know,
the ridiculously rich lady

27:04.122 --> 27:06.559
whose New Year's Eve rooftop party
we're throwing in two weeks

27:06.583 --> 27:08.418
- Oh, shoot.
- Yeah.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.669
Can you do it without me?

27:10.670 --> 27:14.132
Livvy! This is Beal Events, Inc,
not Tyler's Entertainments.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.674
I can't always do this
without you.

27:15.675 --> 27:16.968
Are you kidding?

27:17.010 --> 27:19.345
She's rich. She'll love you.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.514
Listen, Anderson is taking Megan
for hot cocoa and ice-skating,

27:22.515 --> 27:24.934
and as someone who has been on
that date, it's a good one.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.771
Livvy, don't you think you're
taking this a little bit too far?

27:27.812 --> 27:31.023
I mean, you could be out
trying to meet new guys instead.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.485
How about we go meet with Lila

27:33.526 --> 27:36.362
and then go out
for some drinks and boys?

27:36.363 --> 27:39.574
Tyler, you know my portfolio
better than I do.

27:39.616 --> 27:43.869
Okay? And you want your own
Tyler Enterprises, right?

27:43.870 --> 27:45.704
This is really good for you.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.707
Okay? You'll be fine.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.041
Okay?

27:49.042 --> 27:50.543
You'll be fine.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.213
Wish me luck!

28:04.099 --> 28:05.493
Okay, I'm going to go get
the tickets.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.935
You guys hurry up
and meet me there.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.353
- Got it?
- [both] Mm-hm.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.396
Thanks!

28:11.523 --> 28:13.983
What? Why do I get
the granny wig?

28:14.025 --> 28:16.111
Do you really want me
to answer that?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.988
You guys were incredible!

28:19.030 --> 28:20.281
Livvy!

28:21.408 --> 28:26.287
Wow! Blond is...
very becoming of you.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.747
Kids are very becoming...
Wait, you have kids?

28:28.748 --> 28:30.500
No, this is my niece and nephew.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.586
Bryce and Bailey. This is
my good friend Livvy. Say hi.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.421
- Hi.
- Hi!

28:35.422 --> 28:37.173
- Did you guys have fun?
- Yes.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.175
Your hair is wrong.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.928
- It's a wig.
- Your wig's wrong.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.847
Kid's say the darndest things.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.265
[Carter] Yeah, yeah.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.642
Anyway, I have to go because
I have this tradition thing...

28:47.684 --> 28:48.685
Oh, okay.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.770
Well... I'll see you around?

28:50.812 --> 28:52.188
- Okay.
- Okay

28:52.230 --> 28:54.273
Bye! Nice to meet you.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.108
Uncle Carter,
your friend's weird.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.570
Really?
I think she's kind of cute?

29:04.284 --> 29:07.245
Anderson has her so convinced
he's Mr. Perfection

29:07.287 --> 29:09.621
that it is time to watch him
crash and burn.

29:09.622 --> 29:10.790
What are you going to do?

29:10.832 --> 29:13.334
I used to do a little figure
skating when I was younger.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.128
It's called the sweet stick.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.522
You use it to sharpen
your blades at home,

29:16.546 --> 29:18.506
but if you sharpen them
improperly...

29:18.548 --> 29:19.965
Kersplat?

29:19.966 --> 29:21.342
Yes!

29:21.384 --> 29:23.529
The only question is how are
we going to switch this out

29:23.553 --> 29:25.805
with one of his blades
without him seeing us?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.266
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said,

29:28.308 --> 29:31.478
"When skating on thin ice,
our safety is in our speed."

29:34.981 --> 29:37.525
Once second, it's kersplat,
the next, it is Emerson.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.652
Is anybody else as baffled
as I am?

29:39.694 --> 29:40.820
Yes.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.907
Good.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.034
You look good in those pants,
actually.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.077
- Thank you.
- Are those leather?

29:48.119 --> 29:49.370
These are my skating pants.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.498
- Ah, okay.
- So look out.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.960
Oh, yeah! Here we go.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.104
This better be good, Anderson.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.463
- You ready?
- I'm excited, yeah!

29:59.881 --> 30:01.299
Let's see what you got.

30:06.679 --> 30:07.847
[Megan laughs]

30:09.140 --> 30:10.141
Been there.

30:10.183 --> 30:11.851
Done that.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.854
Bought the shirt and spilled
hot cocoa all over it.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.482
- Come on.
- Ready?

30:19.234 --> 30:21.694
[grunts, groans]

30:23.071 --> 30:25.073
[Megan] Are you okay?

30:25.114 --> 30:27.826
I think there's something seriously
wrong with these skates.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.535
Oh, sure, blame the skates.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.871
Yeah! -[Megan] Are you okay?
Anderson?

30:32.872 --> 30:34.624
[groans]

30:36.251 --> 30:38.336
I don't think it's the skates,
but come on.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.547
Slow.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.549
Oh, my God.
I don't think I can walk.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.385
- Let's get you on some safe ice, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.721
Hey, ladies.

30:48.763 --> 30:49.806
Hey.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.016
You ready to shred some ice
roller derby style?

30:52.058 --> 30:53.810
Are you kidding?
I was born on the ice.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.893
Mm.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.521
There they are.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.234
Oh!

31:02.861 --> 31:04.612
Oh, hey!

31:04.654 --> 31:06.072
It's you.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.574
You remember me?

31:13.246 --> 31:15.665
Ho ho ho!

31:15.707 --> 31:17.417
Oh! Hey!

31:17.458 --> 31:21.587
You gotta stand still!
It's Charity Santa. What's up?

31:21.588 --> 31:22.547
[Megan] Oh, whoa.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.465
Okay, yeah, you're really good.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.151
[Beau] Thank you.
You're not too bad yourself.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.594
Thank you.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.094
[Megan] Anderson,
where are you going?

31:29.095 --> 31:30.406
[Anderson] I'm going to get
new skates.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.223
Okay, let me... I got to...

31:32.265 --> 31:34.475
Okay, I'm coming with you.
Hold on.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.898
What now?
He's trading out skates?

31:41.316 --> 31:43.442
[Murphy] And we just lost
Mr. December.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.671
This is what happens when you
let a man do a woman's job.

31:45.695 --> 31:48.281
Come on, girls.
Let's get to the ice.

31:51.159 --> 31:54.162
Guys, I'm not good at this.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.748
All right, look. I have an idea.
You just...

31:56.789 --> 31:59.918
stay up there and just wait
and watch. Okay?

31:59.959 --> 32:01.293
- Here?
- Yeah.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.630
What are we going to do? Just...

32:05.089 --> 32:06.591
[laughter]

32:07.884 --> 32:09.302
[Megan and Zoe shout]

32:09.344 --> 32:11.054
[Anderson shrieks]

32:11.095 --> 32:12.804
[groans]

32:12.805 --> 32:14.349
I'm sorry!

32:16.309 --> 32:17.976
[giggles]

32:17.977 --> 32:19.896
[Zoe] Oh, my gosh!

32:19.938 --> 32:21.397
Are you all right?

32:21.439 --> 32:24.400
Yeah, I just don't know
about my pride, but, you know.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.487
- You got it?
- Now I know how a walnut feels.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.864
Why don't we go
to my place and relax?

32:33.242 --> 32:34.744
That completely backfired!

32:34.786 --> 32:36.995
He's gonna take her home
and she's gonna nurse him,

32:36.996 --> 32:39.540
and he's gonna do
the fireside feel-up on her!

32:39.582 --> 32:40.999
Not if I get there first.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.295
Plan B is chilling
in the back of my rental car.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.590
What did you get?

32:47.632 --> 32:49.425
Remember Anderson's intolerance?

32:50.885 --> 32:54.013
- [gasps]
- Yes!

32:59.686 --> 33:02.063
[whispering] Zoe, watch
for Anderson's car. Okay?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.481
Okay. Okay, okay.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.039
[whispering] That's good!

33:21.290 --> 33:22.417
Okay. Good.

33:23.459 --> 33:24.877
[gasp] Guys, they're coming!

33:24.919 --> 33:26.378
Lock the door!

33:26.379 --> 33:28.506
[whimpers]

33:29.966 --> 33:31.426
Oh! Jeez!

33:32.552 --> 33:35.263
- They're gonna see us!
- No! Why? Why?

33:35.304 --> 33:36.806
Go back! Go back!

33:38.433 --> 33:40.476
- [Megan] Okay...
- Yeah.

33:44.897 --> 33:48.359
- [Anderson] I'm gonna go here.
- Okay.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.069
- [Anderson yelps]
- I'm right behind you.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.030
[mutters]

33:52.071 --> 33:53.781
Oh! [coughs]

33:55.783 --> 33:56.783
Hi!

33:58.411 --> 34:02.999
- [Megan] Okay... Careful.
- [Anderson groans]

34:03.041 --> 34:04.333
[Megan] Almost there.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.752
- [Anderson yelps]
- [Megan] Slow, slow!

34:06.753 --> 34:09.087
All right, there's got to be
a huge bruise...

34:09.088 --> 34:11.507
Wait! Hang on there. I got you.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.091
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.137
- Oh, yeah!
- Okay, all right.

34:16.179 --> 34:19.056
[Megan] You just lay there. I'm
gonna make you a pack of ice. Okay?

34:19.098 --> 34:22.935
Okay, yeah. Ooh, and how about
some of that big kid eggnog?

34:22.976 --> 34:24.978
You know, just to take
the edge off the pain.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.355
Ah.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.190
[groans]

34:28.232 --> 34:29.650
[muttering] I can do this.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.527
I told you! He's going in
for the fireside feel-up

34:32.570 --> 34:34.906
and it's two dates too soon!

34:34.947 --> 34:36.782
Two dates too soon?

34:36.783 --> 34:39.869
But I got the fireside feel-up
on our second date.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.955
What?!

34:42.996 --> 34:45.917
He brought you here
when we were still together?

34:45.958 --> 34:49.378
Whoa, Murph, your face
is as red as your hair.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.838
Shh! She's coming back!

34:50.880 --> 34:54.466
- All right. Here you go.
- Ooh, yes!

34:54.467 --> 34:56.344
- Okay. Hold on. Be careful.
- Okay.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.804
- Lift up just a little.
- Yeah. [groans]

34:58.805 --> 34:59.931
Lift up.

34:59.972 --> 35:03.475
- Okay, good?
- Oh, yeah. Good. Yes, thank you.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.103
- Cheers.
- Now, you just lay there.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.437
Cheers.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.980
All right, yeah.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.148
Mmm.

35:14.987 --> 35:16.197
[relieved sigh]

35:16.239 --> 35:18.324
- Yes...
- Here, I got it.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.993
- Okay. Now...
- I got it.

35:21.035 --> 35:24.622
Come on, come here.
Come lay next to me.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.207
[Megan clears throat]

35:26.249 --> 35:27.375
That'll be...

35:27.416 --> 35:29.836
Come on, get over here!

35:32.672 --> 35:36.759
I'm sorry I ruined
our big date tonight.

35:36.801 --> 35:40.555
I'm such a pain in the butt.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.765
[Megan and Anderson laugh]

35:42.807 --> 35:46.727
No, it's okay. It's actually kind of nice
to know you're not perfect at everything.

35:46.769 --> 35:51.649
Mm. I still think
I'm perfect at most things.

35:51.691 --> 35:52.859
Mm.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.778
Come here.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.409
[gasps]

36:01.450 --> 36:04.162
Look at him milking her
like a dairy cow.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.704
Until that sweet dairy cow

36:05.705 --> 36:08.124
sends him
straight to the restroom.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.836
- [loud gurgling]
- [Megan gasps]

36:11.878 --> 36:14.547
What? Was that your stomach?

36:16.591 --> 36:19.051
[loud gurgling]

36:19.093 --> 36:20.386
What...? Be careful!

36:20.428 --> 36:22.013
[Anderson] Give me a minute.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.102
Hold on, let me...

36:29.645 --> 36:32.899
[loud gurgling]

36:37.987 --> 36:40.740
- Anderson, are you all right?
- [groaning] Yeah?

36:40.781 --> 36:42.617
Is there anything I can do?

36:42.658 --> 36:45.536
[Anderson] No!
I mean, I'm good, thank you!

36:45.578 --> 36:49.498
- [Anderson farting]
- Okay, I... Maybe I should go?

36:49.540 --> 36:51.709
[Anderson] Yeah, you know,
probably a good thing.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.921
Just it's... My tailbone
is really just hurting me a lot.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.214
[Anderson yelping]

36:56.255 --> 36:59.008
Yeah. Look, Anderson, I know
what's really going on. Okay?

36:59.050 --> 37:02.136
I have an allergy
to shellfish and I get it.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.388
So, there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.098
Do you want some acid reducers?

37:07.225 --> 37:10.102
[gasping] That would be awesome.
That would be great.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.771
They are in the kitchen,

37:11.812 --> 37:14.565
above the sink,
on the right-hand side.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.192
Thank you.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.904
Okay. You do you,
and I'll be right back.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.116
Acid reducers?

37:26.035 --> 37:27.620
Go. Go...

37:29.038 --> 37:30.748
I think we need to forget
this whole thing.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.959
Everything we do is
bringing them closer together!

37:33.000 --> 37:35.962
Frankly, I'm tired
of missing my cycling class

37:36.003 --> 37:38.297
to watch the two of them
paw all over each other.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.840
[Zoe] Maybe she's right, Livvy.

37:39.882 --> 37:42.885
It's starting to affect
my performance at the park, too.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.970
Princess almost cried
in front of the kids today.

37:44.971 --> 37:48.266
No! We've come way
too far to quit now.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.161
I mean, it's five days before the holiday
office party at the country club.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.311
That gives us
way more than enough time

37:53.312 --> 37:55.898
to case the joint and devise
a foolproof plan, right?

37:55.940 --> 37:57.275
Like what?

37:57.316 --> 37:59.586
You guys think of everything and
anything we can do to Anderson

37:59.610 --> 38:01.320
to get us put on Santa's
naughty list.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.364
Leave the rest up to me. Got it?

38:06.075 --> 38:07.075
Good.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.747
Okay.

38:11.789 --> 38:15.960
[rock instrumental
of "Deck the Halls" playing]

38:34.979 --> 38:37.106
Should I sit at this table?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.868
'Cause I wouldn't want you
to think I was...

38:38.899 --> 38:41.192
hitting on you again
or anything.

38:41.193 --> 38:43.194
Yeah...

38:43.195 --> 38:44.572
I'm sorry.

38:44.613 --> 38:45.906
I was having a rough week.

38:45.948 --> 38:49.118
I was kind of going
through a breakup and...

38:50.536 --> 38:51.871
Can we start again?

38:53.372 --> 38:54.373
Sure.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.710
Thanks.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.646
Well, thank you for meeting me.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.797
I think you can tell
by my portfolio,

39:01.839 --> 39:03.841
I'm really good
at conceptualizing a theme.

39:03.883 --> 39:07.678
Okay, look.
I know you're a big hitter...

39:08.888 --> 39:10.473
but I don't want
any extravagance.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.784
What I need for you to do is
take our bland little clubhouse

39:12.808 --> 39:15.186
and turn it
into a cozy holiday retreat.

39:15.227 --> 39:18.397
Just make it homey,
like an old friend.

39:18.439 --> 39:22.568
And this was Anderson's idea?
Because somehow...

39:22.610 --> 39:24.236
I find that hard to believe.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.155
Actually, it was mine.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.909
[clears throat] Between us,
our firm has garnered

39:29.950 --> 39:31.911
a reputation for being
a bit... cold.

39:31.952 --> 39:35.873
So I thought the German investor and his
wife might enjoy some Christmas spirit.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.918
So this year, I thought
maybe we'd step it down a bit.

39:38.959 --> 39:42.546
Ah... So like a cozy
little Christmas at home.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.049
Yeah. You think that's lame?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.426
No, those are the best kind.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.554
- So you'll still do it, then?
- Yes!

39:50.596 --> 39:51.931
Under two conditions.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.600
One, you can't tell Anderson
that you hired me.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.478
It's been a while, so I want
to keep it a little secret.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.146
- Okay.
- And number two.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.939
Because I only have five days
to get this ready,

40:00.940 --> 40:03.484
I have to bring my two
associates on board as well.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.819
Yeah, sure, no problem.

40:04.860 --> 40:07.363
Great! We'll just need
the keys to the clubhouse

40:07.405 --> 40:09.824
and a list of all arrivals.

40:11.575 --> 40:12.535
Okay.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.452
Carter? These are my associates.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.664
It is nice to meet both of you,

40:16.705 --> 40:20.291
So... do you ladies think you can
accomplish all that in five days?

40:20.292 --> 40:22.461
Oh, of course! We've
practically already started.

40:22.503 --> 40:25.630
Mm, you wouldn't believe
what we're capable of.

40:25.631 --> 40:26.882
Great.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.013
[knocking]

40:33.055 --> 40:34.098
Come in!

40:35.850 --> 40:37.308
Ty brought Thai.

40:37.309 --> 40:40.104
And I see someone's back
in the Christmas spirits.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.564
I think I am.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.649
And I think it's going to be the
merriest Christmas that ever was.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.317
Good! I am so glad

40:46.318 --> 40:48.380
you got that whole Rudolph's
Reject thing out of your system

40:48.404 --> 40:50.281
because we need to talk
New Year's Eve!

40:50.322 --> 40:53.033
I was thinking we can do
an oyster bar with an open bar,

40:53.075 --> 40:56.494
- and the bartenders can wear...
- Tyler, that sounds wonderful.

40:56.495 --> 40:57.788
Can we talk about that
next week?

40:57.830 --> 40:59.497
'Cause Zoe and Murphy
are coming over

40:59.498 --> 41:03.169
and we're gonna go for this
country club Christmas thing

41:03.210 --> 41:05.045
for Anderson's firm. It's...

41:05.087 --> 41:10.217
Oh, so you got a new gig and you asked
Crazy One and Two for help instead of me?

41:10.259 --> 41:11.969
Well, not exactly.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.345
See, I couldn't use you

41:13.387 --> 41:17.099
because we're planning on
destroying the entire weekend,

41:17.141 --> 41:20.436
not making it pretty and perfect
like you and I would!

41:20.478 --> 41:22.313
Tyler, please, don't be mad!

41:22.354 --> 41:23.874
Aren't you
and the stalker sisters getting

41:23.898 --> 41:26.066
a little out of control
with this?

41:26.108 --> 41:28.026
What is getting back at him
going to resolve, Livvy?

41:28.027 --> 41:29.528
It's not going
to bring him back.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.196
I don't want Anderson back.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.198
But you don't want this new girl
to have him, either?

41:33.199 --> 41:36.577
I just don't want her to fall
into the same trap as we did.

41:36.619 --> 41:41.206
I mean, if we didn't step in,
then she would be a goner.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.751
I don't wanna leave her
as bitter and jaded as we are.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.045

to feel bitter or not.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.382
And for the record?
I liked the Livvy

Okay.

I can't believe you!

Now he's definitely
not going anywhere!

44:46.475 --> 44:49.436
Sorry, but it's obvious,
he likes him some Livvy!

44:49.478 --> 44:51.397
- It's cute.
- How is that obvious to you?

You can't even tell the difference
between an evergreen and an oak!

is a great observer.

Well, do you have any idea
how hard it's gonna be

to set up Anderson's self-sabotage
with him here the entire time?!

45:06.078 --> 45:10.582
Maybe we can just plant my safari
sounds CD in Anderson's car,

45:10.624 --> 45:13.252

the engine on to leave.

[Livvy] Oh! Mind your head.

45:37.443 --> 45:39.445
So what made you get
into event planning, anyway?

45:39.486 --> 45:42.114
Well, my mom had a theme for
every holiday party growing up.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.949
Each had its own
special dinner menu,

45:43.991 --> 45:45.409
and flower arrangements, so...

45:45.451 --> 45:48.412
I guess I just became
really good at it.

45:48.454 --> 45:51.123
And how about your colleagues? How'd
you guys meet? They seem fun.

45:51.165 --> 45:52.790
They're great.

45:52.791 --> 45:54.209

Why software engineering?

46:01.133 --> 46:03.010
Well, believe it or not,

46:03.051 --> 46:05.220
I was a bit of a computer
and gaming nerd

46:05.262 --> 46:07.514
when I was growing up.
Don't say anything.

46:07.556 --> 46:09.784
And... I don't know, I guess
it's just like what you said,

46:09.808 --> 46:11.685
I just realized it was
something I was good at.

46:11.727 --> 46:14.145
That's good, 'cause you kind of
suck at what you're doing.

to be making bows, so...

46:16.940 --> 46:19.150
- I knew that.
- You did?

46:19.151 --> 46:22.863

can make better bows than you can.

- Do you cook?
- [scoffs] Yeah!

- Delicious is my middle name.
- I'll tell you what,

you take the top.

is Delicious?

What? You never told us that!

that middle name?

- It's uncanny.
- [Carter] That was nice of them.

48:01.336 --> 48:02.730
You must have dated
some really great guys.

and zero follow-through.

[Livvy] If it is,
it's a big one.

48:15.851 --> 48:18.102
Because all of us have been
through the same experiences.

48:18.103 --> 48:19.897
We've all been lied to
or cheated on...

48:19.938 --> 48:23.692

are some good guys out there still?

48:23.734 --> 48:26.778
What happened
to your ex-girlfriend?

48:26.820 --> 48:29.489
Well... It ended.

48:29.531 --> 48:31.949
And she just really wanted
to get married, and...

48:31.950 --> 48:34.429
I knew that deep down, we weren't
really in love each other, so...

48:34.453 --> 48:36.663
So you dumped her?

48:36.705 --> 48:39.624
Yeah. I didn't lie
or cheat on her.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.459
Right, but you
didn't commit either.

48:41.460 --> 48:44.004
I mean, what's so wrong
with committing to a woman

48:44.046 --> 48:46.130
who knows what she wants
out of her life?

48:46.131 --> 48:49.068
No. See, that's the thing. She didn't
know what she wanted when it came to us.

48:49.092 --> 48:52.303
All she knew that she wanted was a ring on
her finger and a couple of kids someday.

48:52.304 --> 48:53.971
It didn't matter if I was
the right guy or not.

48:53.972 --> 48:57.017
Half the time it felt like
we barely even knew each other.

48:57.059 --> 48:58.894
We weren't even friends.

48:58.936 --> 49:02.064
Maybe she wanted to be more than just
your lady friend. You ever think of that?

49:02.105 --> 49:05.483
Or an independent woman who can't
speak her mind without judgement.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.694
Or seen as nothing more
than banging legs

49:07.736 --> 49:10.821
and perfect teeth
and big brains.

49:10.822 --> 49:13.909
Or maybe it's just that
you girls are chasing this image

49:13.951 --> 49:16.495
of an unattainable guy
that you think you want,

49:16.536 --> 49:18.222
and then when you finally
catch him, you realize,

49:18.246 --> 49:21.333
he's not half the guy you spent all
this time cracking him up to be.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.711
Maybe it's not the problem
that all guys are alike.

49:24.753 --> 49:27.965
Maybe it's just that you girls
aren't very good at picking them.

49:28.006 --> 49:29.216

it quits with her?

49:34.179 --> 49:35.430
Hmm!

49:38.558 --> 49:43.271
Wow... If by gift basket girl
you mean my mom? Then...

49:43.313 --> 49:47.734
I would say no. It's probably pretty
hard to call it quits on her.

49:47.776 --> 49:52.197
Your mother is the one that you
thought gave you that gift basket?

49:52.239 --> 49:55.242
Yeah. I mean, she denied it,

49:55.283 --> 49:56.844
but when I was a kid,
she used to always joke

49:56.868 --> 49:59.180
and say if I was naughty, I
wasn't going to get any presents,

49:59.204 --> 50:02.457
so, I just thought it was like
a secret gag gift from her.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.543
Wait. Who did you think
gave me the gift basket?

50:04.584 --> 50:06.544
Some girl you were seeing?

50:06.545 --> 50:08.130
Ah...

50:08.171 --> 50:10.966
Well, if that were the case,
I guess...

50:11.008 --> 50:13.343
I could see how that would make
me appear, but...

50:14.261 --> 50:15.470
I'm not that guy.

50:16.263 --> 50:19.391
Apparently not, and I'm sorry.

50:20.225 --> 50:22.269
It's okay. We all...

our Christmas cheer.

Yes! Yes, we should do that.

with the tree?

you could use my help.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.523
With "Her Convicted Criminals"
being the best one.

53:13.565 --> 53:15.025
What? No!

53:15.066 --> 53:17.444
- "Vegas In Cuffs" is way better.
- No way!

53:17.485 --> 53:20.155
- [Carter] Yes. Here.
- Thanks.

53:20.197 --> 53:23.074
And on the weekends,
a couple of my buddies and I

53:23.116 --> 53:24.408
play in a softball league.

53:24.409 --> 53:28.038
No way! I love softball.

53:28.079 --> 53:29.580
- You play?
- No...

53:29.581 --> 53:32.751
Not since junior high.
My mom made me quit.

53:32.792 --> 53:33.835
She said,

53:33.877 --> 53:35.629
"You can't bust out
your pearly whites.

53:35.670 --> 53:37.755
- "Who would wanna marry you then?"
- Huh.

53:37.756 --> 53:40.634
So what do you do
in your free time?

53:40.675 --> 53:43.720
- When I'm not working...
- Mm-hm.

53:43.762 --> 53:47.098
I'm a One Stop Salad Shop
kind of gal.

53:47.140 --> 53:48.558
And on the weekends?

53:48.600 --> 53:50.685
If I'm not doing an event,
I would...

53:50.727 --> 53:53.438
always do whatever my ex
wanted us to do.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.483
- He never asked you what you wanted to do?
- No. He always had a plan.

53:56.524 --> 53:57.817
And my mom always used to say,

53:57.859 --> 54:00.945
"A handsome man with a plan
does a good hubby make."

54:00.946 --> 54:01.988
Yeah...

54:03.073 --> 54:04.282
It's interesting.

54:10.538 --> 54:11.957
- There you go.
- Thank you.

54:13.375 --> 54:15.252
Well, you know what I think?

54:15.293 --> 54:18.672
I think... you listen
to your mom too much.

54:18.713 --> 54:20.966
I mean, I had no idea

54:21.007 --> 54:23.301
what I wanted to do
after college and look at me.

54:23.343 --> 54:26.136
I mean, some might even say
that I am hubby material.

54:26.137 --> 54:28.974
I don't know.
I haven't tried the cocoa.

54:30.183 --> 54:31.935
Mm-hm.

54:33.353 --> 54:34.562
Mm! [coughs]

54:34.604 --> 54:37.691
That is terrible!
It's the worst cocoa ever!

54:37.732 --> 54:41.569
See now? Who wouldn't want to marry
the man that made that hot cocoa?

54:41.611 --> 54:44.906
Between the banister and this,
it's a wonder you're still single.

54:44.948 --> 54:47.784
Well, the banister thing
was a complete fluke.

54:47.826 --> 54:50.203
I have no idea
how that turned out so well.

54:50.245 --> 54:51.746
Sure.

54:53.748 --> 54:56.251
Actually, you've got just
a little bit right there.

55:00.839 --> 55:04.092
And about the dinner...
I'm sorry.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.677
No, I...

55:06.845 --> 55:08.846
You were right on the mark.

the best decisions

55:12.642 --> 55:14.686

how do you know Ms. Beal?

Livvy? Is... was... She was
last year's party planner,

59:25.395 --> 59:27.981
for the holiday event,
at the firm.

59:28.856 --> 59:31.109
And you hired her?

59:31.150 --> 59:32.110
Mm-hm.

59:32.111 --> 59:34.070
I ran into her in the office
the other day.

She's really pretty.

I'm sensing a little jealousy.

- Beautifully decorated.
- Yeah. Thank you.

Hey, Carter. I have to use
the restroom for a minute.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.955
Do you mind showing them
the pool and the koi pond?

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.415
Yeah, sure.

- Hello.
- Hi.

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:38.842
What is this?

01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:40.553
We have cranberry meatballs,

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:41.429
and bean and olive tartines.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.806
No, I mean,
what are you doing here?

01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:47.351
And my assistant said you were at
my office this week, is that true?

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:49.520
I came by to drop off
your spare key,

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:51.189
and I ran into Carter
at your old office,

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:53.149
and he offered me a job.

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:54.233
What's the big deal?

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:56.360
The big deal
is that we broke up and...

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.613
I'm not so sure
this is entirely appropriate

01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.715
that you even took this job.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.075
Well, I don't think
it's entirely appropriate

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.552
you sharing a room
with your assistant,

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.721
especially one that you told me
wasn't that attractive...

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.163
Livvy, look at me.

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:09.957
I swear to you,
when I hired Megan,

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:12.919
I had no intention
of ever being with her.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.920
Okay?

01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:15.755
And it was after
you and I broke up

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.131
that I even asked her out
anyway.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.508
I am so sure, Anderson.

01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:21.427
But you know what?
Whatever you do in your life

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:22.552
is your business.

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:25.598
I'm just here to serve
hard apple cider and...

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.016
set the mood!

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.892
You sure this isn't
some sort of deep-seated,

01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:30.436
desperate attempt
to get me back?

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.247
We know what a deep-seated
attempt would mean,

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:34.166
that I would actually
have to have feelings for you

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.942
in the first place.

01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:38.068
Right. Yes.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:41.197
I mean, you did want to marry me
like, what, a month ago?

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.907
I'm over it, Anderson.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.909
Why would I be here if I wasn't?

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.955
You weren't planning on telling
Megan about our past?

01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:50.580
I've been working with Carter
for two weeks

01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:54.419
and I haven't told him, so...
why would I tell Megan?

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.754
Good. Good.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:59.423
So just... make sure and...

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:01.300
drop off that spare key
to my house

01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:03.594

and heading out.

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:29.619
insanely beautiful.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.122
Thank you.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:35.251
Um. So after tonight, I would...

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:37.170
really like to see you again.

01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:39.630
Would it be too presumptuous
of me to ask

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:42.800
if you have any New Year's Eve
plans as of yet?

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:46.929
So I'm doing a rooftop party
at Old Garth Manor on Second.

01:02:46.971 --> 01:02:48.472
Right, of course.

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:49.473
But...

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:52.268
Would you like to come?

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:55.062
I would love to.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.898
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

01:02:56.939 --> 01:03:02.153
I am going to go and let you
finish getting... foxy!

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.156
I actually have something
to tell you

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.449
about Anderson before...

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:07.968
Okay, look,
if you're going to tell me

01:03:07.992 --> 01:03:09.702
that you had a thing
for him before...

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:12.538
you don't have to,
'cause I already know and...

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.165
it's fine.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.792
How do you know that?

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:19.003
Well, I saw the way you sized-up
Megan that day that we met and...

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:22.465
I also saw you sneaking into that
gift basket to see who it was from

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:25.593
when you thought it was from
one of his girls, so...

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:28.638
- Well, actually, what I was...
- You know, Livvy,

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:32.015
I don't care that
you had a thing for Anderson.

01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:33.768
Most women do.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.312
And not to knock my boss,
but from everything I've heard,

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.314
he's taken advantage
of a lot of women.

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:41.692
And... I'm just glad that
you're not one of those girls.

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:47.740
Hi.

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:49.700
Why are you sneaking in
from the balcony?

01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:51.994
Oh... that's a...

01:03:52.036 --> 01:03:53.203
good question.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:54.704
Yeah, well,
we didn't want to come in

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.582
through the front door,
under the mistletoe

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.375
because then we would have to,
like, kiss,

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.546
and that would be like, whoa.
Eww.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.925
Okay... I am going to go now.

01:04:10.721 --> 01:04:12.055
So...

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:15.059
I see someone has fallen head
over heels this holiday retreat,

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.978
and it surely
wasn't for a Whitmire!

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:19.730
Livvy! Have you even taken care
of any of your duties all day

01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:20.898
while we've been gone,

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.234
or are you just sucking face
with Santa the whole time?

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.944
Did you rig the bathtub?

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:26.028
Did you plug the chimney?

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.404
Excuse me?

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.073
I have been too busy cooking
all day to do any of that.

01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:32.636
Okay. Well, have you even thought about
what you're going to tell Carter

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.412
when 50 strangers show up
banging on that wreath?

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:37.790
Okay, if you guys
just stay scarce,

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:40.584
Anderson's not going to know
we're involved in any of this.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:44.463
And if he does, it's his word
against mine. Okay?

01:04:44.505 --> 01:04:47.341
Oh, okay. So you just want
us to stay scarce,

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.968
so that
you can take all the glory?

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.970
I think what she's saying
is she wants us to do it

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.514
so that she can be
with Carter and...

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.224
if that makes Livvy happy,

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:58.101
then I'm on board
whole-heartedly.

01:04:58.102 --> 01:04:59.687
Okay. We'll do that.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.856
We'll just stay quiet
and we'll stay out of sight.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.441
Thank you.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.742
Who wants
my secret recipe sangria?

01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:14.702
Ooh, me!

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.620
Bernd!

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.830
I think I got
a little something stiffer

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:18.974
in the liquor cabinet for you.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:21.291
- Yeah?
- O'Dwyer's single malt.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:24.170
42 years.
Twenty-two grand a bottle!

01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:25.963
- Please.
- Yeah.

01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:30.468
[mouthing words]

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.027
Hi.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:51.821
Jeez, for a 12-pound poodle,
you are seriously deadweight.

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:53.824
Get... Get off.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.495
[Anderson clears throat]

01:05:57.536 --> 01:06:00.957
Anyone seen my O'Dwyers?
'Cause it was here this morning.

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:10.006
Here, get rid of this.

01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:11.425
[cork pops]

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.428
What are you doing?

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.763
You said to get rid of it.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.682
I didn't mean like that.
I meant...

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:21.352
It's the holiday.

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:28.150
Hey, Livvy, are the girls
gonna be joining us?

01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:30.528
- What girls?
- Oh, Livvy's assistants.

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:34.532
Uh... Excuse me. Olivia Beal
has female assistants?

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:38.368
- Where's Ty?
- Ty? Who's Ty?

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.954
- He's...
- [doorbell rings]

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.374
The door... bell.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.542
- Is... I'm gonna go.
- [doorbell rings]

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.420
Were we expecting anyone else?

01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:49.505
Uh...

01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:53.300
- Oh!
- [all] Merry Christmas!

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.051
[cheering]

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:58.722
Is this Mr. Whitmire's
tacky sweater party?

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:01.224
- Suppose it is. Come in.
- Nice.

01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:05.562
Uh... Hi. And...
Who invited all of you...

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:07.523
- guys here?
- Do you know Mr. Whitmire?

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:10.443
- I... am Mr. Whitmire.
- Then you did.

01:07:10.484 --> 01:07:12.486
That's funny, 'cause I...

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.238
- Hey!
- That's assault.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.699
[Megan] Come on in. Hi.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.242
Whoa! That's a shiny
and a lot of metal and...

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.078
Sunglasses at night.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:23.914
Okay.

01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:25.041
- Hi!
- You're good.

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:26.082
Ooh. Hi.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.754
[nervous laughter]

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.673
I'm real sorry about this. I'm not
real sure what's going on here,

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.884
but I'm gonna throw
these people out, right now.

01:07:34.925 --> 01:07:37.053
- Anderson! It's the holidays.
- What?

01:07:37.094 --> 01:07:39.221
You can't just throw
all these people out?

01:07:39.263 --> 01:07:40.615
What if they have
nowhere else to go?

01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:42.933
Megan. This is not part
of the plan.

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:45.770
Why do you always have to follow a
silly little rigid plan anyways?

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.438
I mean, really.
What's the big deal?

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.942
Yeah! Why can't
they just... stay?

01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:54.779
- Livvy did make plenty of food.
- Yeah.

01:07:55.696 --> 01:07:58.157
I did make a lot of food.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.618
Livvy!

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:05.247
You're right. I mean,
what's the big deal, you know.

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.892
- The more the merrier.
- It's party time.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.959
- [Anderson] It's party...
- Party, party, party.

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:10.711
Party, party, party.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.426
Hey, did you invite
all these people?

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:20.595
Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:21.823
No. What are
you apologizing for?

01:08:21.846 --> 01:08:24.183
I mean,
it's a risky move, but...

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.535
investors are having
a great time.

01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:28.520
Oh. Okay. You go entertain them.
I'll be right there.

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:30.106
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:36.779
Is that holiday sangria realness
you're serving up, Lady Beal?

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.822
What are you guys doing here?
They're gonna recognize you.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:41.323
Amongst all of these characters?
I don't think so.

01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:43.661
Come one, Cupid. Let's ride.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.669
[piano music playing
jazzy Christmas music]

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:11.188
Here you go.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:14.859
Hey, Livvy. Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.194
Yes.

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:20.381
I'm sorry. I know you're working
and everything. I just...

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.031
wanted to ask...
I probably shouldn't.

01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:24.910
No, it's okay. Ask away.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:29.706
Well, I wanted to ask, um... Have
you known Anderson very long?

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:32.710
Well, I...
did the last holiday party,

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:35.796
so I've known him
a little bit, yeah.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:39.508
Okay. So then, you know,
from a girl to a girl...

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:41.635
I know you don't know
him very well,

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:43.845
but we've been seeing
each other for a month now,

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:46.473
and he's so wonderful, it seems
like it's too good to be true.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.100
So, do you think
he's a nice guy?

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.815
When I'm dating a guy that I
think is "too good to be true,"

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.818
I go on this website called
"rateyourex.com,"

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.197
and it is all these girls
talking about their exes.

01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:02.615
It's... You should check it out.

01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:06.785
Oh! I've never heard of it.
Is it for older women?

01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:10.831
- No. It's for everyone!
- Great!

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:14.543
But I still would kind of like
a person's real life opinion.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.754
So, what do you think of him?

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:22.051
That's it!
Who drank my O'Dwyers?

01:10:22.092 --> 01:10:23.260
[whispers] What?

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.349
[Zoe] Tyler!

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.059
[Tyler] Hi.

01:10:32.144 --> 01:10:35.356
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Zoe invited me.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:39.026
What? You said to invite anyone
I know who likes to get crazy.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.028
It's a nice tacky
sweater, by the way.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.697
I didn't know it was
a tacky sweater party.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.283
[Tyler] What is all of this?

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:48.953
Have you completely gone
chestnuts?

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:50.454
Anderson might be
a little angry,

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.373
but I haven't cost him
his job, Ty.

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:55.625
We just wanna make sure he doesn't
unwrap this poor little girl

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.044
before Christmas Eve. Okay?

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.421
I mean, he should be thanking me.
The investors love it.

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:03.175
What about you? Looking like
a desperate, crazy person?

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:05.803
Because I completely don't know
who you are anymore.

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:08.681
If you came here to lecture me
like my mother, Ty,

01:11:08.722 --> 01:11:10.599
you can leave, okay?

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:11.952
We're just having
a little bit of fun.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:14.561
When did you become such a...
sourpuss?

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:17.064
When did you become
such a sour apple?

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.358
I'm sorry.
Is everything okay here?

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.528
Yes, yes. This...

01:11:22.569 --> 01:11:23.946
is Ty...

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.281
Tyler. Tyler.

01:11:26.323 --> 01:11:27.700
Your old assistant?

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:30.994
- Old assistant?
- He didn't mean that.

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:33.622
Zoe and Murphy
aren't my real assistants.

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:35.457
- Mm-hm.
- Tyler is!

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:38.877
Rudolph! It's time for singing.

01:11:38.919 --> 01:11:41.004
[Tyler] I'll be leaving now.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:44.049
Looks like you're wanted
on stage anyway.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.012
Merry Xmas, Livvy.

01:11:51.515 --> 01:11:53.017
- [Zoe] Come, come.
- [stammers]

01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:56.353

- It's payback.

Anderson, what is going on here?

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.622
These are all
my crazy ex-girlfriends.

01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:40.725

The Charity Santa.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.839
That was you, right?
And then the broken skates.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.466
And the O'Dwyers that I smell
on your breath.

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:51.176
And the eggnog.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.595

with other nice girls

who become friends
to seek revenge.

Anderson, is that true?

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:07.192
- Megan, these girls are crazy!
- Is it true?

Livvy and I were over by the
time you and I started dating.

01:14:09.653 --> 01:14:11.447

when it ended?

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.033
It matters.

01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:18.078
'Cause men like you give men
like us a bad name.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.373
[gasping]

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.127
That was for you too.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.176
[whispering] Thank you.

01:14:39.099 --> 01:14:40.100
Guys.

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:50.527
Hi.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.032
Can you talk?

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:57.326
Your check's on the dresser.

01:14:57.367 --> 01:15:00.245
I'll have a crew sent over
after the holidays to...

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:01.538
clean the place up.

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:03.916
I'm sorry...

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.754
that I didn't tell you the truth
about Anderson.

01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:10.172
I mean, I tried to, but...

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:13.300
Was that before or after
you tricked me into hiring you?

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:18.472
Did it ever occur to you that
I could lose my job over this?

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.973
No.

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:23.560
Not at first, but eventually.

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.872
I mean, that's why I tried
to keep the girls out of sight.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.899
And then when I realized what I
got myself into, it was too late.

01:15:31.276 --> 01:15:32.735
Hmm.

01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:35.256
When you said that Anderson had
taken advantage of all these girls,

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.925
I didn't want you to think
I was one of them.

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:39.575
You were the first guy...

01:15:39.576 --> 01:15:41.161
who hasn't treated me that way.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.914
That's exactly
how you treated me, Livvy.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.917
You played me like a fool.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:51.046
You even had me believing that this stupid
holiday romance was the real thing.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:54.757
Everything I felt for you,
Carter, here...

01:15:54.758 --> 01:15:56.260
it was all real.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:16:00.472
I didn't expect to fall for you
during all of this.

01:16:00.514 --> 01:16:04.267
We just wanted to get back at
Anderson for making a fool out of us

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:06.812
and show him he couldn't
keep doing this to every girl.

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:09.982
I didn't... mean to make
a fool out of you.

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.778
Do you know
what it feels like to be...

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.447
lied to and cheated on
over and over again?

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:21.702
No.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.161
No, you wouldn't.

01:16:23.203 --> 01:16:26.289
That is... That is such crap.

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:28.291
Livvy...

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.168
Anderson didn't make
a fool out of you.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:33.046
You girls, you did that
just fine on your own.

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:35.924
I mean, I understand that it
hurts to have your heart broken.

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:37.718
I've had that before.

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.635
Okay, but I what
I don't understand

01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:43.307
is why you would continue to let someone
who's hurt you have so much power over you.

01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:46.768
Anderson doesn't have any power
over me. Not anymore.

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:47.978
No, Livvy...

01:16:49.062 --> 01:16:51.315
Anderson has had
all the power over you

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:54.484
on every decision that you've
made since the day you met him.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.404
And even now,
after he cheated on you

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:00.115
and left you,
he still has all the control.

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:02.993
Don't you see that?

01:17:11.376 --> 01:17:14.588
No. You wouldn't. Would you?

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.175
[sniffs]

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:26.433
[Murphy]
It feels good, doesn't it?

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:29.227
Finally socking it to Anderson
the way we always dreamed?

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.064
You know, in a way.

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:36.068
But in a way, it doesn't
really change much either.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.528
What are you talking about?

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:40.465
I don't know about you,
but I'm never going to forget

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.783
that look on his face
when he found out.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.409
That was classic!

01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:47.037
[sighs] I don't know.
Maybe Carter's right.

01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:49.748
Maybe we're not very good
at picking good men.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.794
So, what? We should date down?

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:56.088
- Ew.
- No.

01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:58.757
No. We should date... up.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:00.717
You know,
like raise our standards.

01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:05.554
How? In a world
where there aren't any.

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:08.433
Maybe that's the problem.
Maybe if we...

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:12.895
stopped settling for less
and start expecting more...

01:18:12.896 --> 01:18:14.690
others would follow suit.

01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:15.732
You think?

01:18:18.735 --> 01:18:20.654
You're really smart.

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.739
I know.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:27.285
You learn a lot eavesdropping on
third-graders while they eat pizza.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.339
[laughter]

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.614
So, Murphy and Zoe told me
where you found them.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.747
I checked out all my fans
on "rateyourex.com."

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:14.124
Wow.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.502
I wanna sue you all
for libel and slander.

01:19:19.045 --> 01:19:20.505
But I won't.

01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:23.133
'Cause I deserved it.

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:29.264
You know, I know that there's not
much I can say at this point...

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.225
but I do want you to know...

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.355
I'm really sorry
for hurting you.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:39.941
It's not you.

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:41.526
It's me.

01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:44.237
When things in my life
get too serious,

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.615
for whatever reason...

01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:48.658
I shut down.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.744
Well, I don't think
it's entirely your fault.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:53.997
I think we all put you
on some pedestal

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.416
that... you didn't
really belong on.

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:01.630
You know, the funny thing
is Megan didn't.

01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:04.800
I think that's what
I really liked about her.

01:20:04.841 --> 01:20:07.844
Not to say that you don't have
your own amazing traits.

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:12.515
I mean, not only are
you one of the most...

01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:17.479
beautifully kind and quietly generous
people that I have ever met...

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:20.732
But look at all this. I mean.

01:20:20.774 --> 01:20:23.692
You are one heck
of a party planner, my friend.

01:20:23.693 --> 01:20:27.823
Even if it was just to...
decimate a guy that...

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:31.868
a guy that you once
hoped to marry.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.289
A guy that didn't deserve you
in the first place.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.918
So if you end up
with old Carter...

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:44.673
I think you'll find
it gets better.

01:20:44.714 --> 01:20:46.215
Well, I don't know
if that's gonna happen

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:47.884
because I really screwed
that one up.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:50.971
You're not gonna fire him,
are you?

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:52.556
No.

01:20:52.597 --> 01:20:55.224
Of course not.

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.702
I am gonna have
a little chat with him

01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.788
about letting wily women affect
his work performance though,

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.731
because apparently I wrote
the book on it.

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:07.362
Will you please forgive me?

01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:09.865
Well, it's Christmas, Anderson.

01:21:09.906 --> 01:21:12.659
What kind of person would I be
if I didn't? Mmm?

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:15.954
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:18.874
[sighs]

01:21:18.915 --> 01:21:20.166
Did you lose your investors?

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:23.085
Aaah, yup. Yeah. I think so.

01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:26.256
I tried giving them my two tickets
to the "Nutcracker, but..."

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.258
- "No danke!"
- I'm so sorry.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.759
Oh. Whatever. Admit it.

01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:33.388
You, you enjoyed watching Megan
dump me just a little bit.

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:35.765
Yeah, I enjoyed the heck
out of it, but you know what?

01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:38.602
You deserve to be better
for yourself next time too.

01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:40.812
Deal?

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.356
Deal.

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:46.442
- [Anderson laughing]
- Last one.

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.403
- Okay.
- Yeah, just last time.

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:51.281
[Anderson] Yeah, right, Lefty.

01:22:11.843 --> 01:22:13.887
Livvy, honey. You know when
you're depressed,

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.222
that dessert counter only
compounds your problems, right?

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:17.984
I'm not depressed, Mom.
I'm just eating pie.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:21.644
Honey, it's obvious you're still
hurting over Anderson.

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:24.022
And this pie is not gonna help
get him back.

01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:25.190
So, why don't you

01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:27.484
give him a call and wish him
Merry Christmas!

01:22:27.525 --> 01:22:29.985
Maybe he's thinking
about you too today.

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:32.322
Anderson was...

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.407
everything
that I thought I wanted,

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:37.535
just nothing that I needed.

01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:39.161
What?

01:22:39.162 --> 01:22:40.664
A friend.

01:22:41.998 --> 01:22:44.459
And... just because I...

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:45.919
have a guy I can have fun with

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:49.338
or some girlfriends to sing
karaoke, it does not mean

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:51.925
that I will ever
stop needing you.

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:55.344
I will always need...

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:56.972
shopping on Sundays

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.807
and homemade pumpkin pie.

01:22:58.848 --> 01:23:01.350
And maybe if Dad's
not looking, then...

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:04.270
we can sneak out and sing
some karaoke together.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:07.523
Well, I was with the women's
chorus when I was in college.

01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:10.443
- I know, I heard!
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:15.824
Honey, you know I just want you
to have a good life, right?

01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:16.992
I know.

01:23:17.033 --> 01:23:19.494
So, whatever makes you happy,

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:21.705
I'm happy for you.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.792
- I love you, sweetie.
- And I love you.

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.922
I feel like if I had like one
last slice of pie, I'd be done.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:35.927
No more pie. And... No.

That from anyone special?

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:22.157
I don't know. What is special?

01:25:22.158 --> 01:25:25.954
I mean, what constitutes as special
for one man could constitute as a...

01:25:25.995 --> 01:25:29.124
complete waste of time
for another. So...

01:25:29.165 --> 01:25:30.165
Ouch.

01:25:31.334 --> 01:25:32.961

Somehow I treated Livvy
like a...

01:25:40.176 --> 01:25:42.845
complete waste of time.

01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:45.765
Well, look. From one guy
who lived to regret it...

01:25:46.891 --> 01:25:48.893
Don't you make
that same mistake I did.

01:26:10.915 --> 01:26:13.877
- [lively chatter]
- [jazzy music playing]

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:20.800
You two have done
an outstanding job.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.135
Thank you.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.511
I'm not sure I'll ever hire

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:27.055
that cranky old party
planner again.

01:26:27.056 --> 01:26:28.558
Credit actually goes to Ty

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.895
because he did the whole project
from start to finish.

01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:36.816
Ty... Have you met
my son, Gregory?

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.735
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:41.487
Do you wanna grab a drink?

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.156
Sure.

01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:53.666
- Hi. Hi.
- Hello.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.252
Wow. It's nice to see
young love still exists.

01:26:59.422 --> 01:27:02.091
- I wanted to say thank you.
- For what?

01:27:02.133 --> 01:27:05.261
I realized I've never had
true girlfriends before.

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:08.096
My mother always said: "Never trust
a single girl around your man"

01:27:08.097 --> 01:27:10.558
because she will always
stab you in the back."

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.561
Wow! I think what she meant
to say was that you

01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:16.397
can trust a true girlfriend
around your man...

01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:18.024
'cause if he screws you over,

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.193
we'll stab him in the back
for you first.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.944
Yeah!

01:27:21.945 --> 01:27:23.445
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:27:23.446 --> 01:27:25.490
To Santa's
three favorite reindeer.

01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:27.784
- Mm!
- Cheers!

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.961
- I'll be back.
- Oh yes.

01:27:39.295 --> 01:27:41.631
I think they're gonna kiss.

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.927
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.722
What are you doing here?

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:52.642
I came here to tell you
two things.

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.310
One.

01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:58.273
Please don't ever put
almond milk in my cereal.

01:27:58.314 --> 01:28:01.651
'Cause I am deathly allergic
to almonds.

01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:03.486
[Livvy] Yeah.

01:28:03.528 --> 01:28:05.780
And... Two.

01:28:08.324 --> 01:28:11.327
Spring sign-ups for my softball
leagues start next week, so...

01:28:12.328 --> 01:28:14.080
How about I sign us up?

01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:19.334
I would love that.

01:28:19.335 --> 01:28:21.169
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:22.838
Yeah.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:25.633
- Come on. The countdown is starting.
- Okay.

01:28:27.343 --> 01:28:29.178
- Come on.
- Hi. I'm coming.

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:35.184
[all] Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:39.314
five, four, three, two, one!

01:28:39.355 --> 01:28:42.775
[cheering]

01:28:56.205 --> 01:29:00.208
So, you're the handsome,
grounded young bachelor

01:29:00.209 --> 01:29:03.713
that Tyler said I was destined
to meet on New Year's Eve.

01:29:04.547 --> 01:29:06.049
My question is...

01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:10.553
Do you donate your entire
Christmas bonus to...

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.555
the Red Cross every year?

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.140
- No.
- No.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:16.642
No, but I have been known to
volunteer as a Charity Santa,

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.561
every couple of years
if I'm able to.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.648
Well, Mr. Bolton I am...
very excited

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:24.859
to see your sexy Santa outfit.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:27.612
Oh, well. Ho ho ho.

01:29:27.653 --> 01:29:29.238
Still not funny.

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:32.825
Merry Christmas, Livvy.

01:29:33.826 --> 01:29:35.328
