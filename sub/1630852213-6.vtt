00:13.599 --> 00:16.480
CRIS:María, did you hear
your sister's voice message?

00:16.559 --> 00:19.920
<i>Listen to it</i>
<i>and call me, please.</i>

00:25.719 --> 00:28.519
MARÍA DEL PILAR:
Lookie, lookie, lookie!

00:28.600 --> 00:31.440
Let's watch cartoons
with Granny.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.000
[laughing]

00:34.079 --> 00:35.719
Look!

00:35.799 --> 00:38.719
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:38.799 --> 00:41.359
Good morning, my love.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
Hello, Xosé.

00:46.359 --> 00:50.280
<i>Are you going to the wedding</i>
<i>after all?</i>

00:58.479 --> 01:00.439
[phone dings]

01:25.079 --> 01:28.040
[line ringing]

01:38.760 --> 01:41.760
[phone ringing]

01:47.319 --> 01:48.680
[groans]

01:48.760 --> 01:52.319
[clicks tongue, sighs]

01:56.640 --> 01:59.480
[music]

02:26.520 --> 02:27.960
ESTHER: I mean,
it was incredible.

02:28.039 --> 02:31.120
I connected with my creativity
at new levels, dude.

02:31.199 --> 02:32.439
I had an awesome trip.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.919
- What kind of trip, drugs?
<i>- No.</i>

02:34.000 --> 02:36.520
<i>When you try a secret plant,</i>
<i>you see yourself,</i>

02:36.599 --> 02:39.000
but you see yourself at a level
that's beyond description.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.479
I can't explain it.
You have to try some, Mary.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.000
- What are you saying?
- It blew my mind.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.919
The molecules,
the cells.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.680
I saw myself, Mary.
I need to be me.

02:48.759 --> 02:49.919
Esther, your wedding
is today.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.639
<i>I don't wanna live</i>
<i>in the city.</i>

02:51.719 --> 02:52.719
<i>I need to live in nature.</i>

02:52.800 --> 02:56.280
<i>I want a vegetable garden,</i>
<i>plant oak leaf lettuce,</i>

02:56.360 --> 02:57.520
<i>Raf tomatoes.</i>

02:57.599 --> 02:59.520
I need to be by the sea.

02:59.599 --> 03:00.719
Iodine, salt.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.680
Sea!
I love you, sea!

03:02.759 --> 03:04.000
I'm staying here
for a while, babe.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.439
Okay, Esther,
have you found your wallet?

03:05.520 --> 03:07.120
<i>- It's not at the retreat?</i>
- No, it's not here.

03:07.199 --> 03:08.759
<i>Look, tell me where you are</i>
<i>and I'll come.</i>

03:08.840 --> 03:10.919
- I'm at Iris' house.
- But who is Iris?

03:11.000 --> 03:14.479
She's the most beautiful,
the most incredible,

03:14.560 --> 03:15.599
the most independent person.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.719
She doesn't give a damn
about anything, she just... is.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.560
Esther, you had a panic attack
before the wedding, it's normal.

03:21.639 --> 03:23.080
- It happens all the time.
<i>- No, Mary.</i>

03:23.159 --> 03:25.000
- No buzzkill, no buzzkill.
- Tell me where you are

03:25.080 --> 03:26.520
and I'll pick you up.

03:26.599 --> 03:28.240
Esther.

03:29.159 --> 03:30.800
[scoffs]

03:32.599 --> 03:33.960
What's up?

03:34.039 --> 03:36.800
Hey, have you seen
my wallet?

03:38.479 --> 03:41.159
You lost it yesterday.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.479
You owe me 50 bucks.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.240
Fuck, I'm dying
of hunger.

03:47.319 --> 03:49.960
The fridge
is full of stuff.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.360
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:53.439 --> 03:55.080
All right.

03:55.159 --> 03:56.080
Thanks for everything.

03:56.159 --> 03:59.639
Thank you.
Thanks for your journey.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.800
Fuck, what an amazing house,
dude.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.400
Shit, Barcelona's so expensive.

04:14.199 --> 04:16.399
Hello.

04:17.639 --> 04:19.120
- Uh...
- Fuck.

04:19.199 --> 04:22.759
Don't worry.
Take what you want.

04:22.839 --> 04:23.399
Enjoy it.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.160
Carmen, one of her friends
is in the kitchen.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.160
Who are you?

04:27.240 --> 04:28.680
- Hello.
- Who am I?

04:28.759 --> 04:30.639
I'm Mariola's dad.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.120
Oh, no, I'm with Iris.

04:32.199 --> 04:34.439
- Iris? Who's that?
- She told us the other day.

04:34.519 --> 04:36.879
Now she's calling herself Iris
after the Greek goddess.

04:36.959 --> 04:40.120
Look, I'm sick of her always
bringing home weird women.

04:40.199 --> 04:40.959
José, don't start.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.439
Since we support her, she should
respect the rules of the house.

04:44.519 --> 04:46.439
I don't like coming home
and finding some--

04:46.519 --> 04:50.480
some woman
without pants on.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.319
- Nothing personal.
- Mm.

04:52.399 --> 04:56.240
Ignore him.
Do you wanna stay for lunch?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.800
[music]

05:35.720 --> 05:39.079
Mary, can you come pick me up?

05:41.639 --> 05:42.920
MARÍA: It's not that ugly,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.319
and you can always
have it removed.

05:44.399 --> 05:45.519
First, I'll get married,
all right?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.720
- Then I'll figure it out.
- But you don't wanna do it.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.240
- Yes, she does.
- She's not sure,

05:49.319 --> 05:51.079
otherwise she wouldn't have
sent us a message

05:51.160 --> 05:52.040
at 3:00 in the morning.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.639
Well, maybe she had
a panic attack, and that's it.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.279
Maybe she panicked because
she doesn't wanna get married.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.120
And maybe she should
decide for herself.

05:58.199 --> 06:00.439
And maybe
you should both shut up.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.439
- You can always get a divorce.
- Fuck, Cris.

06:03.519 --> 06:05.519
- "Fuck, Cris," what?
- That's supportive, yeah?

06:05.600 --> 06:07.040
No, it's not supportive,
it's reality.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.639
Out of 100 marriages,
60 end in divorce

06:08.720 --> 06:09.920
in Spain,
did you know that's true?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.319
A ton of married couples
stay together

06:11.399 --> 06:12.639
- and grow old together.
- Sure, so many.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.240
- How many do you know, María?
- A bunch.

06:14.319 --> 06:17.000
My parents are divorced,
now yours...

06:18.519 --> 06:20.279
What about them?
Mine aren't.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.439
- She's obsessed, ignore her.
- You're totally patronizing

06:22.519 --> 06:24.680
- your sister, Mary.
- Okay, Cris, cut it out.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.160
Papa and Mama are divorcing?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.800
- María!
- Already divorced.

06:31.199 --> 06:32.879
[tires screeching]

06:32.959 --> 06:34.439
[gasps]

06:37.120 --> 06:38.879
What do you mean
they're divorced? Why?

06:38.959 --> 06:40.759
- Holy fuck.
- Mom wanted a separation.

06:40.839 --> 06:43.040
How can she do this to Papa
at this late stage

06:43.120 --> 06:44.079
in their lives?
Come on.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.920
With these things,
there isn't good or bad, okay?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.560
- You keep out of it.
- Fine.

06:47.639 --> 06:48.800
Why didn't you
tell me anything?

06:48.879 --> 06:50.720
Because they wanted to wait
till after the wedding

06:50.800 --> 06:51.920
so they wouldn't ruin your day.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.160
I'm over it, dude,
over you

06:53.240 --> 06:54.800
always treating me
like a little kid.

06:54.879 --> 06:57.399
- Why didn't you call me?
- When?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.319
When you had a breakdown?

06:58.399 --> 07:00.720
You went and ran off to Tarazona
to the middle of fucking nowhere

07:00.800 --> 07:02.800
instead of calling me.
I mean, I'm your sister.

07:02.879 --> 07:04.000
I called
but you didn't answer.

07:04.079 --> 07:05.319
Well, then, you can
call me again.

07:05.399 --> 07:06.720
Well, I couldn't wait
for you to recover

07:06.800 --> 07:08.160
from your hangover
in order to talk to you.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.279
Okay, let's go.
Or do you wanna leave Julia

07:10.360 --> 07:12.600
- standing at the altar?
- That's what I was gonna say.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.560
Hey, Cris, can you
keep out of this?

07:14.639 --> 07:15.360
Yeah, exactly.

07:15.439 --> 07:17.000
Stop butting in
and deal with your own family.

07:17.079 --> 07:18.639
You've definitely got shit
to sort out, dude.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.399
Look, babe, when you manage
to stay in a relationship

07:21.480 --> 07:22.720
for a whole year,
call me and we'll talk

07:22.800 --> 07:24.319
- about families, all right?
- [laughing] Yeah.

07:24.399 --> 07:26.920
I guess if managing it
equals fucking around,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.720
then I'd manage too,
no sweat.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.800
María, could I get out
of the car for a minute, please?

07:31.879 --> 07:34.680
Okay, listen, I know we're all
pretty on edge right now.

07:34.759 --> 07:36.000
But we have to go,
we have 40 people

07:36.079 --> 07:37.639
- at a wedding waiting for us.
- Just need to get out

07:37.720 --> 07:39.160
for a moment, sweetie,
if you'd be so kind,

07:39.240 --> 07:42.160
- please just move.
- Okay.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.279
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.560
No, dude, Cris, no.
Don't start smoking again.

07:47.639 --> 07:50.360
Fucking hell, Jesus Christ!
What is your fucking deal?

07:50.439 --> 07:54.040
It's for your own good.
Don't smoke, dude.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.240
- There.
- Seriously?

08:00.560 --> 08:01.720
Apologize, okay?

08:01.800 --> 08:06.600
Cris, hey, listen.
I apologize, okay?

08:06.680 --> 08:09.519
- Can we please go now?
- Yeah, come on, we can go.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.319
So, why do you
wanna get married?

08:13.720 --> 08:16.160
Because I have a fucking
great thing with Julia,

08:16.240 --> 08:18.240
and-- and I love her.

08:18.319 --> 08:20.240
And because
she really wants it.

08:20.319 --> 08:22.199
- No.
- Do you?

08:22.279 --> 08:24.319
Tell us the truth.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.439
Because I want
an adult relationship.

08:31.279 --> 08:33.159
I mean, why shouldn't
I get married?

08:33.240 --> 08:35.240
Why not?
You guys both did, right?

08:35.320 --> 08:37.120
So, why can't I marry
a person who I love?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.399
Someone who makes me feel
stable and grounded?

08:39.480 --> 08:41.360
She doesn't make me
feel like shit,

08:41.440 --> 08:42.600
or a loser,
or a nutjob.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.559
But you aren't a nutjob
or a loser.

08:44.639 --> 08:46.120
María, please don't, dude.
Hello?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.559
I just got these fucking feet
tattooed on my neck,

08:48.639 --> 08:51.279
and I can't find my wallet,
and I wanted to move

08:51.360 --> 08:52.320
to Lloret de Mar.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.600
You want a partner,
or you want a mother?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.519
I don't know.
I don't know.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.320
And besides, if it doesn't
work out, we'll divorce.

09:01.399 --> 09:04.120
Everyone gets divorced.
That's what you said.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.159
But I said that in order to get
a reaction out of you, sweetie.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.279
Do you know how difficult it is
to get a divorce?

09:10.360 --> 09:11.159
Jesus!

09:11.240 --> 09:13.480
- Fucking excruciating!
- [sighs]

09:13.559 --> 09:17.279
It's tough to leave any
relationship, sweetie, right?

09:17.360 --> 09:18.519
Well, now,
imagine saying "I do"

09:18.600 --> 09:20.759
in front of everyone you know,
and signing those papers,

09:20.840 --> 09:22.159
and the moment
you sign those papers,

09:22.240 --> 09:23.960
you have a chain that
constantly tugs at you.

09:24.039 --> 09:25.360
And then mortgage,
boom, another chain,

09:25.440 --> 09:27.279
and then a kid, another chain.
Another kid, another chain.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.320
And then there's a moment where
you don't know where you are,

09:29.399 --> 09:32.480
you can't move, and you
don't know how to get out.

09:32.879 --> 09:36.399
- [sighs]
- Do you wanna leave Pablo?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.279
- Cris?
- Shut up, María.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.720
- You want a separation?
- Just shut up.

09:39.799 --> 09:41.159
You've got no fucking idea,
shut it.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
No, of course I have no idea.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.000
Since you got a lover,
you don't tell me anything.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.440
- Oh my God.
- You think that this fling

09:45.519 --> 09:47.240
will help you get over
your issues with Pablo

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
and you won't have to suffer.

09:48.399 --> 09:50.240
- That's not gonna happen.
- I don't want Pablo to suffer.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.440
But you're already suffering,
both of you.

09:52.519 --> 09:54.080
You're just prolonging the pain.

09:54.159 --> 09:55.159
Don't you see this double life

09:55.240 --> 09:56.600
is gonna drive you crazy
with all the lies?

09:56.679 --> 09:59.320
What right do you have
to lecture everybody?

09:59.399 --> 10:01.480
You think you've got it
figured out?

10:01.559 --> 10:02.639
What the fuck are you doing

10:02.720 --> 10:03.679
- with Xosé?
- Uh...

10:03.759 --> 10:05.080
Are you inventing
a father for your son?

10:05.159 --> 10:06.799
What's wrong with the one
he's got, he's not good enough?

10:06.879 --> 10:09.879
You're putting more focus
on that than on your own son.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.679
What are you saying?

10:12.759 --> 10:14.159
You've got no fucking idea

10:14.240 --> 10:15.519
what it's like
to be in my situation.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.080
You had a kid with someone
you were in love with.

10:19.159 --> 10:21.159
Every day, my son's
right there in my mind,

10:21.240 --> 10:23.159
every day reminding me
that my life is a failure,

10:23.240 --> 10:24.799
that I'm a terrible mother,
I'm a piece of shit.

10:24.879 --> 10:27.639
I brought a child into the world
and I don't know what to do

10:27.720 --> 10:29.480
because I can't give him
what he needs.

10:29.559 --> 10:31.639
I can't give him
what he needs, I...

10:31.720 --> 10:34.200
I don't know
how to love him.

10:34.279 --> 10:35.879
I can't do it.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.919
I've had two days without him,
and I don't miss him.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.720
I'm not a good mother.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.639
- I mean, how do I...
- Mary, forgive me.

10:47.720 --> 10:51.200
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Hey, forgive me.

10:51.279 --> 10:52.720
- I'm sorry.
- You'll love him

10:52.799 --> 10:53.759
eventually, dude.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.120
You will love him.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.679
He's a little bundle
of squishy flesh.

10:56.759 --> 10:58.600
He was just born,
we don't know him at all.

10:58.679 --> 11:02.000
- He only eats and poops.
- And pees.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.200
You know that when
he gets a bit older,

11:04.279 --> 11:05.120
when he says "Mommy,"

11:05.200 --> 11:09.039
when he interacts with you
and says "I love you,"

11:09.120 --> 11:12.240
then you'll love him, man.

11:12.799 --> 11:15.279
[María sighs]

11:22.120 --> 11:24.279
[sighs]

11:24.360 --> 11:27.360
[music]

12:02.799 --> 12:06.080
[country music playing]

12:09.320 --> 12:12.120
- You got it?
- Yeah.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.000
Hang on, give me the suitcase.

12:16.080 --> 12:16.919
Esther?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.799
MARÍA: Esther?

12:19.960 --> 12:21.000
- Sweetie?
- What is it?

12:21.080 --> 12:23.960
I'm getting married,
but if I don't, what'll I do?

12:24.039 --> 12:25.120
I feel so lost right now.

12:25.200 --> 12:29.120
If you don't wanna get married,
Esther, you don't have to.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.159
- Okay?
- It'll be fine.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.440
We are here to support you,
whatever you decide.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.440
- Of course.
- Okay?

12:33.519 --> 12:34.639
- Uh-huh.
- Whatever you decide

12:34.720 --> 12:36.559
- will be fine.
- [vomiting]

12:36.639 --> 12:38.519
Oh, fuck.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.480
Just talk to Julia,
then send us a message,

12:41.559 --> 12:43.200
and we'll talk to all
the guests for you.

12:43.279 --> 12:45.120
- All right, what will you say?
- That you're sick,

12:45.200 --> 12:47.000
you threw up,
and you can't get married today.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.720
Fuck, she's not
picking up her phone.

12:49.799 --> 12:51.080
She's upstairs.

12:51.159 --> 12:53.600
- Go for it, we'll wait here.
- Go on.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.519
No, hey, you guys
are coming with me.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.879
Just up to the door.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.759
- Up to the door.
- Up to the door.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.279
[whispering]
There's no one here.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.360
Come on, go, go, go.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.320
Oh. Oh, fuck.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.159
That is your room,
and this is yours, okay?

13:16.240 --> 13:18.039
- Mm.
- Everything'll be fine, right?

13:18.120 --> 13:19.000
- Yes.
- Totally.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.080
- Positive.
BOTH: Yes.

13:20.159 --> 13:22.360
- Good luck.
- Okay.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.440
Go on.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.000
Hello?

13:28.080 --> 13:30.960
JULIA: I'm in the bathroom,
I'll be right out.

13:31.039 --> 13:31.519
Okay.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.159
Hey, sorry about
what I said before.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.440
No, I'm the one
who's sorry.

13:34.519 --> 13:35.440
I didn't know what I was saying.

13:35.519 --> 13:36.960
- Me neither.
- But I love you.

13:37.039 --> 13:38.399
Love you too.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.159
Come on, I have to pee, dude.

13:42.679 --> 13:45.240
- Honey.
- [sniffling]

13:45.840 --> 13:48.720
- What is it, babe?
- Nothing.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.039
Listen, I'll wait outside.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.360
Okay, I'll see you there.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.200
Okay.

13:55.799 --> 13:56.600
[Pablo sniffling]

13:56.679 --> 13:59.159
What do you mean, nothing?
What's wrong?

13:59.240 --> 14:03.440
I've been thinking about
what we talked about yesterday.

14:04.639 --> 14:07.440
I don't want a separation.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.879
I do.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.080
[sniffling]

14:23.679 --> 14:27.320
- I'm sorry.
- I'm gonna leave.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.200
The-- the girls
are at my mother's.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.919
You'll pick them up tomorrow,
all right?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.559
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay.

14:35.639 --> 14:37.200
- Okay.
- Um...

14:37.279 --> 14:39.399
I'm gonna stay at home
for tonight.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.000
And after that,
I don't know, I...

14:41.080 --> 14:44.320
Whatever you need.
Anything you need.

14:44.639 --> 14:48.879
Yeah, sure, okay.
We'll see how we sort this out.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.480
- My wallet.
JULIA: What was that?

15:09.559 --> 15:11.279
My wallet.
I thought I lost it.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.960
Oh, no, you left it
under the bed.

15:13.039 --> 15:15.799
I was gonna pull a scam
and do something with your ID,

15:15.879 --> 15:20.080
but in the end I didn't do it.
[chuckles]

15:24.519 --> 15:28.639
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.559
Yeah.
[both chuckle]

15:32.080 --> 15:35.440
Hey, what's that?
Some feet?

15:35.519 --> 15:39.279
Um... yeah, well, I just...

15:39.360 --> 15:42.000
To be honest,
I got pretty wasted, actually.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.759
Sure.
All that yoga

15:43.840 --> 15:45.320
and all that meditation.

15:45.399 --> 15:46.360
[both chuckle]

15:46.440 --> 15:48.480
Well, I tried this
super crazy plant

15:48.559 --> 15:51.919
that made me have a whole
sort of revelation

15:52.000 --> 15:54.080
- about my feet.
- Ah, makes sense.

15:54.159 --> 15:56.600
It was your bachelorette party,
wasn't it?

15:56.679 --> 15:58.440
I explored the Ebro Delta
in a canoe

15:58.519 --> 16:00.159
paddling along
with Maite and Lola.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.519
- You serious?
- Yes, yeah.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.000
[both laughing]
And you got super wasted

16:04.080 --> 16:07.320
and got a tattoo
of some feet.

16:15.799 --> 16:19.799
- They're hideous, right?
- Um...

16:19.879 --> 16:23.440
Everything looks good on you.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.039
You gonna get married
like that?

16:29.519 --> 16:31.200
No, I'll do makeup and stuff.

16:31.279 --> 16:33.919
No, I mean dressed
like that, silly.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.960
It's getting pretty late.
I mean, at this rate,

16:36.039 --> 16:39.279
I'll end up having
to get hitched to DJ Luna.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.600
[both laugh]

16:43.200 --> 16:45.519
I'm really crazy about you.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.960
I love you so much.

16:49.159 --> 16:50.679
So much.

16:51.399 --> 16:53.080
Me too.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.360
[baby babbling]

17:01.440 --> 17:04.440
GARI: Yeah, so that one
in the middle

17:04.519 --> 17:07.440
is a cypress tree,
and that's a pine.

17:07.519 --> 17:08.480
See it over there?

17:08.559 --> 17:11.519
Don't worry, one day
you'll know them all.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.480
That's a pine.
It's a big tree.

17:13.559 --> 17:14.920
Next to it is--
is an oak.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.880
- When the seasons change...
- Gari.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.319
Hello, Juanito.
- Hi.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.039
Teaching him
the names of the trees?

17:21.119 --> 17:21.599
Yes.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.640
- That's nice.
- Yes.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.079
And how are you, María?

17:27.160 --> 17:28.240
Better.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.440
- Yes?
- Yes.

17:30.519 --> 17:31.720
And you?

17:31.799 --> 17:34.559
Yeah, I'm also better, yeah.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.519
I'm sorry I've been kind of
on edge these last few months.

17:37.599 --> 17:38.799
No, no, no.
No worries.

17:38.880 --> 17:44.440
I-- I mean, I...
I was a bit tense too, María.

17:45.079 --> 17:48.240
I mean, I'm curious.
Aren't you freaked out?

17:48.640 --> 17:51.119
- Of what?
- Of doing it wrong?

17:51.200 --> 17:56.480
No, I...
I just-- just am afraid

17:56.559 --> 18:00.200
you guys won't let me
really do it.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.640
- Hi.
- Hello.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.880
- How are you?
- Really good.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.279
- How's the bride?
- Fine, fine, fine.

18:06.359 --> 18:08.480
She should come down,
they're waiting for her.

18:08.559 --> 18:09.920
GARI: Bye. Ready?
- See you.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.160
- Bye! See you! See you!
- See you, Mommy!

18:12.240 --> 18:16.480
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye, Mommy.

18:16.559 --> 18:19.599
Can I hold him?
[chuckles]

18:20.880 --> 18:23.440
[sighs]

18:25.559 --> 18:27.359
[sighs]

18:29.160 --> 18:30.920
- How'd it go?
- I'm doing it.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.440
- You serious?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:32.519 --> 18:34.160
- What happened?
- What's up?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.599
- The wedding's on.
- What?

18:35.680 --> 18:38.680
That's life, dude, you know?
That's how it goes.

18:38.759 --> 18:40.480
And how are you?

18:40.559 --> 18:42.720
We're going to separate.

18:42.799 --> 18:44.400
BOTH: What?

18:44.480 --> 18:47.480
Aw, babe.
But what led to it?

18:47.559 --> 18:48.440
No clue.

18:48.519 --> 18:49.920
Oh, Cris, I'm so sorry.

18:50.000 --> 18:50.880
- Yeah.
- Cris?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.319
- What?
- I know it's a fucking bummer,

18:52.400 --> 18:54.000
but I've gotta get married,
and my wedding suit

18:54.079 --> 18:55.440
is in the van,
you know, but I empathize.

18:55.519 --> 18:57.519
- Yeah, let's go get your suit.
- Let's go.

18:57.599 --> 18:59.799
- [humming]
- You got the keys?

18:59.880 --> 19:02.079
Do you have the keys
to the van?

19:02.160 --> 19:03.119
Oh, God.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.440
Oh, my dress is horrible.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.799
Never mind.
Go, go, go.

19:08.119 --> 19:09.440
Do we even know
where we parked?

19:09.519 --> 19:10.559
- Over there?
- Yeah, come on.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.400
- Let's go, hurry.
- Oh, careful, careful.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.519
Ah! Motherfucker.

19:16.599 --> 19:19.920
- Pass me stuff.
- Here, your suitcase.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.319
Is that Xosé?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.680
That's Xosé's car.
Did you invite him?

19:24.759 --> 19:26.039
Yeah, when you were dating.

19:26.119 --> 19:28.279
Uh, we're not together anymore.

19:28.359 --> 19:29.079
Forget it, babe.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.799
Sorry I had
an existential crisis

19:30.880 --> 19:32.440
and I forgot to uninvite him.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.599
- Hey.
- This is too much.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.440
The hell?

19:39.559 --> 19:41.319
XOSÉ: Hi.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.240
- How are you?
- A bit stressed

19:43.319 --> 19:45.279
because I thought
I was gonna be late.

19:45.359 --> 19:47.079
Guys, we're really late,
so will you

19:47.160 --> 19:48.720
- hurry it up, please?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:48.799 --> 19:49.880
- Thanks.
- Okay, sure.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.960
So, today's been pretty weird.

19:51.039 --> 19:52.440
Can we maybe
talk some later?

19:52.519 --> 19:54.359
- You and me?
- Yeah.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.119
About what?

19:56.599 --> 19:57.640
Mm, well...

19:57.720 --> 20:00.200
About anything specific?

20:00.839 --> 20:03.119
- About us.
- About us?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.279
Seriously.
Seriously?

20:05.359 --> 20:07.480
- Yeah, we're coming.
- We're coming, we are.

20:07.559 --> 20:09.160
But you said
you didn't want an "us".

20:09.240 --> 20:12.720
That's true.
But I've been thinking, and...

20:12.799 --> 20:16.319
and I do want an "us" now,
if you do.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.680
ESTHER: Mary, move your ass!

20:18.759 --> 20:21.759
Anyway, we'll talk later.
You better go, go.

20:21.839 --> 20:25.240
- Go, we'll talk later.
- Yeah.

20:25.319 --> 20:26.960
See you.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.519
[music]

20:41.079 --> 20:43.599
[all chuckle]

20:44.400 --> 20:47.359
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

20:48.759 --> 20:53.599
[music]

21:56.119 --> 21:59.200
[cheers and applause]

21:59.279 --> 22:02.000
[music continues]

22:23.720 --> 22:27.400
[sighs]
I can't be with you.

22:29.119 --> 22:29.559
Oh.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.519
I mean, I really want
to be with you.

22:32.599 --> 22:34.119
- But?
- No, there is no but,

22:34.200 --> 22:36.000
because that would undo
what I said,

22:36.079 --> 22:38.240
and I don't want that.

22:39.319 --> 22:42.599
I'm not doing great,
and I have to learn

22:42.680 --> 22:44.640
how to be alone.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
If we start something now,
it'll be shitty.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.240
Hm.

22:53.720 --> 22:57.279
I guess we're out of sync
this time, right?

22:58.039 --> 22:59.000
Mm-hmm.

22:59.079 --> 23:01.920
- Well, fuck.
- Well, fuck.

23:03.759 --> 23:05.640
I love you so much.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.599
Me too.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.759
- I'm gonna go, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

23:22.839 --> 23:25.319
There's a shuttle for guests
leaving right now.

23:25.400 --> 23:28.240
Oh, no, you came by car.

23:28.319 --> 23:31.799
Okay, so... bye.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.440
Bye.

23:35.359 --> 23:38.079
[music slowing, stopping]

23:38.160 --> 23:42.039
And now, it's time
for the photo, ladies.

23:42.599 --> 23:43.319
[music continues]

23:43.400 --> 23:45.440
WOMAN: Okay, here we go,
looking good.

23:45.519 --> 23:46.799
Long live love.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.960
How's Papa doing
