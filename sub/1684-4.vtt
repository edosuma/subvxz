00:01.127 --> 00:02.796
<i>Previously on</i>
Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.879 --> 00:04.923
I killed Jason Boland
and Devon Jones.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.341
You did a brave thing,
Captain,

00:06.424 --> 00:08.677
confessing to those crimes
to save your daughter.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.220
How about you guys
take me along?

00:10.303 --> 00:12.389
I know his type,
Lieutenant.
He's a privateer.

00:12.472 --> 00:15.100
Where's the coin you stole?
Have you sold it already?

00:15.183 --> 00:17.018
They've
appointed a replacement
for Captain Irving.

00:17.102 --> 00:19.396
<i>Slinking through the tunnels</i>
<i>to avoid Madame Sheriff</i>

00:19.479 --> 00:21.356
is an absolute waste
of our time.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.233
No police work, Crane.
Sheriff's orders.

00:23.316 --> 00:25.860
I'm Henry Parish.
I'm Captain Irving's attorney.

00:25.944 --> 00:27.112
It's quite standard.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.073
A confirmation
that you're
enlisting my services.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.701
Captain,
you must not trust him.

00:32.784 --> 00:35.328
Because he is
the Horseman of War.

01:09.821 --> 01:12.699
I have faced many
enemies on horseback.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.201
Horsemen without heads.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.537
Even discovered my own son

01:17.620 --> 01:20.206
is the Apocalyptic
Horseman of War.

01:21.458 --> 01:24.586
Thus, how challenging
must it be

01:24.669 --> 01:27.464
to guide the power
of 300 horses

01:27.547 --> 01:29.716
using only one's right foot?

01:32.510 --> 01:34.512
Crane, you've seen me
do this a thousand times.

01:34.596 --> 01:35.722
You have
an eidetic memory.

01:35.805 --> 01:38.558
Do not tell me that
you do not have this.

01:40.477 --> 01:41.936
Also, I happen to know
that you've been

01:42.061 --> 01:43.521
practicing your driving
with Jenny,

01:43.605 --> 01:46.608
who's had her license
suspended twice, by the way.

01:46.691 --> 01:47.859
Firstly, I fail to see

01:47.942 --> 01:51.654
why each and every
human on the planet
must utilize a motor vehicle.

01:51.738 --> 01:53.239
And secondly,
if you're implying

01:53.323 --> 01:54.449
I would use this conveyance

01:54.532 --> 01:55.867
without your
express permission...

01:55.950 --> 01:58.411
That gauge right there
doesn't lie.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.164
The odometer.

02:01.623 --> 02:04.751
Curse you, Franklin,
for inventing such
a traitorous device.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.544
Crane, if we're gonna
win this war,

02:06.628 --> 02:08.755
you need to master
certain skills from this era.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.465
Ergo, you need to
drive a damn car.

02:10.548 --> 02:12.509
Now, quit stalling.
So be it.

02:12.592 --> 02:15.136
Remember, all that power
is now a part of you.

02:15.261 --> 02:16.387
Make it your steed.

02:16.554 --> 02:17.639
Oh.

02:18.389 --> 02:21.100
You're referring
to <i>Jinba Ittai.</i>

02:22.727 --> 02:24.562
Why didn't you say so?

02:25.730 --> 02:28.066
Let us release
our own horsemen.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.990
All right.
Ooh! Slow down. Crane?

02:36.199 --> 02:38.326
I need you to slow down.
We're in a parking lot!

02:38.409 --> 02:39.953
Oh!

02:44.624 --> 02:47.585
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:48.253 --> 02:50.421
Slow down! Slow down!
Slow down, Crane!

02:50.672 --> 02:52.465
Crane, Crane, Crane! Crane!

02:57.804 --> 02:58.805
Mmm.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.057
<i>Jinba...</i>
<i>Ittai.</i>

03:01.140 --> 03:03.935
It's a Japanese term.
It means "Horse
and rider as one."

03:04.018 --> 03:05.645
You've been messing with me
this whole time?

03:05.728 --> 03:07.397
Perhaps if you
install a turbo charger,

03:07.522 --> 03:09.148
this vehicle would
have better acceleration.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.608
Get out of my car.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.407
I'd say you're
well on your way
to independence.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.284
In case something
happened to you.

03:20.410 --> 03:23.788
Crane...
You can drop the facade,
Lieutenant.

03:24.247 --> 03:27.917
I'm all too aware
of why you insist
I learn these skills.

03:28.001 --> 03:31.129
But hear me,
Grace Abigail Mills.

03:31.963 --> 03:34.257
It is not our fate
for one of us to
bury the other.

03:35.383 --> 03:38.970
We shall be victorious
or defeated together.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.474
And until then,
we spend every waking moment

03:43.558 --> 03:45.977
looking for a way to defeat
Moloch and the Horsemen.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.606
We're building our army.
Our network of spies.

03:49.689 --> 03:51.316
Katrina, Miss Jenny,

03:51.399 --> 03:54.235
even Captain Irving's
predicament could
be used to our advantage.

03:54.319 --> 03:56.237
And now I can drive.

03:56.321 --> 03:57.614
That wasn't driving.

03:57.697 --> 04:01.284
That was unsafe
operation of a vehicle
without a license.

04:02.368 --> 04:03.661
I should arrest
your ass for it.

04:03.995 --> 04:05.079
Perhaps if you could catch me.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.252
I have received
an AMBER Alert.

04:11.336 --> 04:12.587
Everyone in
the area gets it.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.255
It's when a child's
gone missing.

04:15.548 --> 04:16.925
I know that family.

04:17.008 --> 04:19.469
A missing child.
We must make haste.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.095
Not so fast, Ricky Bobby.

04:21.179 --> 04:22.639
I'm driving.

04:30.188 --> 04:33.399
It's been hours.
Why haven't we heard anything?

04:33.691 --> 04:36.027
Lieutenant Mills
and her people are doing
everything they can.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.487
Then they need to do more.

04:38.696 --> 04:39.781
She is 10 years old.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.908
There's no sign
of forced entry.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.118
And we don't know
what happened.

04:44.202 --> 04:45.954
So, let's stay positive.

04:48.373 --> 04:49.624
Is there any way

04:49.707 --> 04:52.251
Sara could've
just wandered off
and gotten lost accidentally?

04:52.335 --> 04:53.461
No, she's a good kid.

04:53.544 --> 04:54.629
She's responsible.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.381
She would never just leave.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.800
And your older boys,
they're adopted?

04:58.883 --> 05:00.510
Any chance Sara
felt left out?

05:00.760 --> 05:02.553
Maybe some friction
between the kids?

05:02.637 --> 05:04.931
Sara was a happy accident
after we got the boys,

05:05.014 --> 05:07.892
but the four of them
couldn't be closer.

05:07.976 --> 05:09.477
Her brothers are
out there now
looking for her.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.728
And we should be
out there looking.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.063
I can't stay
inside here anymore...

05:12.146 --> 05:13.398
Honey, you need to
forgive yourself.

05:13.523 --> 05:14.691
Or we will not
get through this.

05:14.774 --> 05:16.943
I'm sorry.
Forgive yourself for?

05:17.402 --> 05:20.029
Last night,
I fell asleep in my office.

05:21.072 --> 05:22.824
I was doing
paperwork and I just...

05:24.200 --> 05:25.785
Drifted off.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.747
And I forgot to set the alarm.

05:30.123 --> 05:32.291
And now, my little girl...

05:41.592 --> 05:43.928
My family is cursed.

05:49.559 --> 05:52.687
"Sometimes people get caught
in the path of a storm

05:53.438 --> 05:54.856
"and there's
nothing they can do

05:54.939 --> 05:56.441
"but wait for it
to pass over them.

05:57.108 --> 05:59.485
"But know that
it will pass."

06:00.862 --> 06:03.281
You told me that
when I was nine.

06:06.117 --> 06:08.745
And those words kept me
from sliding off
the edge of the world.

06:10.455 --> 06:12.540
I didn't know if
you'd remember me.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.710
When Jenny and I became
wards of the state,

06:16.419 --> 06:18.546
if you hadn't
been in my life,

06:18.963 --> 06:21.507
I don't think I'd be wearing
this badge right now.

06:21.591 --> 06:24.594
I think that's more
August Corbin's doing
than mine.

06:25.053 --> 06:27.138
I was just your caseworker.

06:30.308 --> 06:33.352
Beth, you've been so good
to me and to my family.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.104
We are going to find Sara.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.316
You have my word.

06:51.621 --> 06:55.166
So, we're celebrating
a scoundrel, are we?

07:05.802 --> 07:06.844
What are you doing?

07:06.969 --> 07:07.970
Helping!

07:08.304 --> 07:11.349
I will not sit idly by
when a child's
life is at stake.

07:11.432 --> 07:15.103
Help me by getting
out of those bushes
before somebody sees you.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.106
Meet me in the woods
and we'll see if we
can pick up Sara's trail.

07:22.235 --> 07:25.613
So, that whole
display case in Beth's
living room is a lie?

07:25.696 --> 07:27.448
Despite what his
descendants believe,

07:27.532 --> 07:30.034
Daniel Forbes Lancaster
was no patriot.

07:30.535 --> 07:33.371
In fact,
General Washington
despised the man.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.916
He sided with the patriots
very late in the war,

07:36.999 --> 07:40.711
after it became clear
the tide had turned
against the British.

07:41.212 --> 07:44.423
We no longer had any need
for his vast holdings.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.426
Beth's family has
funded foster care
programs for years.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.762
You believe the Lancasters
are trying to make amends

07:49.846 --> 07:52.098
for their
ancestor's selfishness?

07:52.181 --> 07:55.226
I'm saying that you
can't undo the past.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.104
Just work on changing
the here and now.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.898
Lieutenant.

08:02.692 --> 08:04.235
There was a struggle here.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.113
Blood spatter.

08:08.573 --> 08:10.575
The ground
gave way here.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.827
There's more
blood splatter.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.370
But whose blood?

08:16.247 --> 08:17.582
I see no trail anymore.

08:18.082 --> 08:19.292
Crane!

08:20.251 --> 08:21.252
Oh.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.422
It's a bone.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.259
And it's hollow.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.595
On purpose. May I?

08:32.221 --> 08:33.264
Ugh.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.267
Jiahu gudi.

08:37.268 --> 08:39.604
A flute made of bone.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.440
This is the oldest known
instrument made in China.

09:06.464 --> 09:08.257
That's odd.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.678
Strange chord structure.

09:16.641 --> 09:17.892
Lieutenant?

09:19.644 --> 09:20.770
Lieutenant!

09:22.813 --> 09:24.148
Okay!

09:26.192 --> 09:29.195
What just happened?
Where the hell was I going?

09:29.487 --> 09:31.906
I believe I know what
threat we're facing.

09:32.823 --> 09:34.909
Miss Sara is not lost.

09:35.368 --> 09:38.663
She was lured into these woods
by a creature of legend.

09:40.331 --> 09:44.585
This instrument
belongs to a pied piper.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.796
God! I haven't had to do
this much sneaking about

10:28.879 --> 10:30.798
since the Second
Continental Congress.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.175
Oh, let me guess,
this was when Betsy Ross
had the hots for you.

10:33.259 --> 10:35.219
Oh, that woman
was relentless.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.888
Once, Adams found me
hiding in a broom closet.

10:39.557 --> 10:40.850
From her.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.269
I'm sure it's because
you were just the cutest
continental courier.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.147
An assessment
your new Sheriff Reyes
does not share.

10:46.564 --> 10:49.233
Until there is
a detente between us,
I shall continue to evade her.

10:49.317 --> 10:51.277
I'm sure you'll grow on her.

10:52.570 --> 10:55.448
I transcribed the range
of the stops in it.

10:55.531 --> 10:58.659
The holes bear
a similar note composition
to a piccolo flute.

10:58.743 --> 11:00.786
B, C, C-sharp, etc.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.164
But they all
pitch up half a key

11:03.247 --> 11:06.083
instead of continuing
a normal sustained note.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.669
But that doesn't explain
why the damn thing
put me in a trance.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.047
Also, you play the flute?

11:11.881 --> 11:14.467
I'd like to see you
try bringing a cello
onto the battlefield.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.469
The Pied Piper's
a German fairy tale, Crane.

11:16.552 --> 11:18.554
The Piper of Hamelin, yes.

11:19.138 --> 11:21.182
But the story I'm thinking of
is much closer to home,

11:21.265 --> 11:23.100
one that is not a fairy tale.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.771
And one that could explain
our mystery abductor.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.732
I once heard,
during the height of the war,

11:29.815 --> 11:32.693
<i>when British soldiers</i>
<i>were quartered</i>
<i>at Sleepy Hollow,</i>

11:32.777 --> 11:37.073
<i>a mysterious man</i>
<i>lured an entire garrison</i>
<i>out of doors</i>

11:37.156 --> 11:40.785
with beautiful,
entrancing music.

11:41.369 --> 11:43.788
<i>Only to subject</i>
<i>each and every soldier</i>

11:43.913 --> 11:46.290
<i>to a cowardly</i>
<i>and ignoble fate.</i>

11:47.249 --> 11:50.961
One man,
a piper with deadly skill,

11:51.962 --> 11:53.089
killed them all.

11:53.631 --> 11:56.050
I didn't think
there was anything
otherworldly about it,

11:56.133 --> 11:59.804
until I saw the effect
this instrument had
on you, Lieutenant.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.263
As the modus operandi match,

12:01.347 --> 12:02.431
it stands to reason that

12:02.515 --> 12:05.935
the same assassin
that lured these men
to their deaths

12:06.018 --> 12:07.728
may have taken
Miss Sara as well.

12:07.812 --> 12:10.731
Why would an assassin
who killed redcoats
target a little girl?

12:10.815 --> 12:13.442
The modus operandi
doesn't quite fit.

12:13.526 --> 12:15.236
That I do not know.

12:15.820 --> 12:18.906
But the effect this instrument
had on you is undeniable.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.952
Do you recall anything
from during your enchantment?

12:23.285 --> 12:25.996
I remember feeling compelled
to go somewhere.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.332
A place.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.501
A summoning spell.

12:31.085 --> 12:34.255
This music actually pulls
his victims to his lair.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.257
I know where
you're going with this.

12:36.424 --> 12:37.883
You play the music,
I get all trancey

12:37.967 --> 12:40.428
and lead us to where
the Piper is holding Sara.

12:40.511 --> 12:43.055
We have no idea what effect
this may have on you.

12:43.139 --> 12:45.850
Not to mention,
we'd be using you as bait.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.476
I know what it's like
to be lost in those woods

12:47.560 --> 12:50.563
and have something evil
messing around with you.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.440
Moloch did it to me.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.191
And now the Piper's
doing it to Sara.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.570
Play the thing.

12:59.447 --> 13:00.656
I do have an idea

13:00.739 --> 13:02.867
how best to control
the effects of the music.

13:06.370 --> 13:10.374
This 30-second loop,
as you accurately named it,

13:11.459 --> 13:13.711
should mimic
the effects of the flute

13:13.794 --> 13:16.505
and prevent it from
affecting anyone
else in the vicinity.

13:16.589 --> 13:18.382
Your first recording.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.969
Maybe we'll cut
an album together
when this is all done.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.721
One achievement at a time,
Lieutenant.

13:26.432 --> 13:27.600
Here.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.564
I will be with you
at every moment.

13:34.732 --> 13:35.900
Good.

13:36.901 --> 13:38.652
'Cause if you
lose sight of me...

13:38.736 --> 13:41.864
A gillygaupus like me?
I can see for miles
at my height.

13:41.947 --> 13:45.409
And I say you
retire that nickname
right here and now.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.637
So beautiful.

14:28.786 --> 14:31.288
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, Lieutenant.

14:32.206 --> 14:34.625
All right? All right?
All right? Yeah?

14:36.961 --> 14:38.462
We may have
found our target.

14:38.796 --> 14:40.631
The Piper?
Quite possibly.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.801
Where?

14:44.009 --> 14:45.678
I saw someone
beyond those rocks.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.650
No! Don't shoot.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.653
Unbelievable.
Hawley.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.656
Oh, hell,
just shoot me.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.534
What happened?

15:09.243 --> 15:10.494
The kid.

15:11.996 --> 15:13.539
She's still alive.

15:13.998 --> 15:15.833
You can still...
You saw her?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.168
There's still time...

15:18.294 --> 15:21.005
There's still time
to save that girl.

15:26.510 --> 15:29.597
So, this Piper, you saw it?

15:29.680 --> 15:32.933
Yo, <i>Pride and Prejudice,</i>
you mind not touching
anything in there?

15:33.017 --> 15:34.852
Some of it goes boom.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.273
It was dark out,
so I didn't really
get a good look at him,

15:39.356 --> 15:41.191
but yeah, he took that kid.

15:43.027 --> 15:45.696
<i>I was out on a job</i>
<i>when I saw the girl.</i>

15:46.655 --> 15:48.032
<i>And then he attacked me.</i>

15:53.245 --> 15:54.788
He's pretty fast
with a knife.

15:54.872 --> 15:57.875
Assuming money's the reason
you're out here,

15:58.167 --> 16:00.794
did the Lancasters hire you
to find Miss Sara?

16:00.878 --> 16:02.671
I'm searching
for a flute.

16:02.755 --> 16:04.048
It's made of bone.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.343
Hollow, covered in holes.
Maybe you've seen it?

16:08.177 --> 16:12.181
It's a high-value artifact,
so any help would
be appreciated.

16:12.264 --> 16:13.807
Tell us what you know,
and we'll take it from there.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.894
Starting with how you knew
the Piper would
strike that night.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.562
It was the kid's
10th birthday.

16:20.064 --> 16:23.150
The curse.
Yeah? No? Well.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.194
There's been a plague
on the Lancaster family

16:25.277 --> 16:27.571
since its legend
began in 1778.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.074
<i>Yes, well,</i>
<i>we know at that time</i>

16:30.157 --> 16:33.827
<i>an entire garrison</i>
<i>of redcoats was stationed</i>
<i>in the family estate.</i>

16:33.911 --> 16:35.454
Much to
Daniel Lancaster's chagrin.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.497
Right.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.499
Apparently,
they were a bit too friendly
with his daughters,

16:38.582 --> 16:41.585
<i>and Daniel decided to take</i>
<i>matters into his own hands.</i>

16:42.252 --> 16:43.420
<i>Of course.</i>

16:43.504 --> 16:45.589
<i>It was Daniel who</i>
<i>hired the Piper of legend</i>

16:45.756 --> 16:47.841
<i>that lured the British</i>
<i>to their deaths.</i>

16:47.925 --> 16:49.885
<i>He was most</i>
<i>likely a mercenary.</i>

16:49.968 --> 16:51.220
They were far too common
during the war.

16:51.303 --> 16:55.307
Daniel hires a mercenary, yes,
but not just anyone.

16:55.516 --> 16:56.684
<i>No.</i>

16:56.767 --> 16:59.436
<i>A killer who had the speed</i>
<i>to kill men quickly.</i>

17:01.063 --> 17:04.441
<i>Let me guess.</i>
<i>Because he'd given</i>
<i>his soul to a demon.</i>

17:19.790 --> 17:21.875
<i>All that would remain</i>

17:21.959 --> 17:24.878
<i>would be for Daniel</i>
<i>to betray that mercenary.</i>

17:26.213 --> 17:29.049
<i>And because</i>
<i>of that betrayal,</i>
<i>every generation,</i>

17:29.133 --> 17:32.469
the Piper supposedly
lures a Lancaster girl
into the woods

17:32.553 --> 17:34.054
<i>when she turns 10.</i>

17:34.638 --> 17:38.642
<i>Which is when her bones</i>
<i>are the right size to</i>
<i>make his instruments.</i>

17:39.184 --> 17:42.354
Each one having
a different effect
on its victims.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.356
Pretty sick stuff.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.692
Yesterday was
Sara's tenth birthday.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.528
If the demon this
mercenary gave his
soul to was Moloch...

17:49.611 --> 17:53.198
Then he would not remain dead,
but rise again as the Piper.

17:54.575 --> 17:57.661
So you fought
this creature,
did you?

17:57.745 --> 17:59.037
Crane.
Creature?

17:59.121 --> 18:01.039
Dude, I got blindsided
by a costumed psycho.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.124
That's about it.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.333
Are you certain about that?

18:05.210 --> 18:08.797
People, the Piper
is just a legend.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.842
A sicko with a costume
acting this whole thing out.

18:11.925 --> 18:12.926
You know, taking kids.

18:13.010 --> 18:15.637
Yet all you want is
to procure his flute.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.389
Well, that's the job, okay?

18:17.848 --> 18:19.933
And for the record,
I tried to save her.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.894
Legend or not,
you said that
the Piper's MO

18:21.977 --> 18:23.687
is to weaken the victims
before he kills them.

18:23.771 --> 18:26.190
Yeah, they die of
exposure or starvation.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.776
It's not really
a fairy tale ending.

18:28.859 --> 18:32.112
It's been less than 36 hours.
We still have
a shot at saving Sara.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.489
But we don't know enough
about what we're facing,

18:33.572 --> 18:35.532
so we need all
the help we can get.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.786
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey.

18:38.911 --> 18:40.287
Just be careful
with that thing, okay?

18:40.370 --> 18:42.247
Wrap it in a soft
cloth or something.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.540
Lieutenant,
need I remind you

18:43.624 --> 18:47.127
that this man
stole the Judas coin
from our very grasp?

18:47.211 --> 18:48.796
I think you mean
I'm keeping it safe.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.798
Here's the deal.

18:50.881 --> 18:54.092
You help us
bring Sara back safe,
this is yours.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.680
That means you tell us
everything that you got
from your research

18:58.764 --> 19:01.141
and provide full
tactical support
on the rescue.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.768
Absolutely not.

19:03.185 --> 19:07.189
Lieutenant, we cannot work
with this callous
brigand-for-hire.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.026
Okay. When do we leave?

19:23.622 --> 19:25.916
"The Horseman of War
will gather his soldiers

19:25.999 --> 19:28.460
"to rise and begin
the End of Days."

19:54.736 --> 19:55.737
Huh.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.040
That is seriously freaky.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.167
What's the gag?
How's that work?

20:09.251 --> 20:12.212
For the love of God,
will you be quiet
for a single moment?

20:12.296 --> 20:13.463
There is no gag.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.799
This is a rather vicious
form of enchantment.

20:15.883 --> 20:17.426
Enchantment. Right.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.845
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant. All right?
Oh.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.763
Hmm. Hmm.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.391
We may have
found something.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.476
You sure?

20:26.935 --> 20:29.438
You were heading
directly towards it.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.315
We do this carefully.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.109
Hawley,
it's time to earn your pay.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.527
What are we walking into?

20:35.611 --> 20:39.406
Well, legend says
the Piper's jam is
to weaponize sound.

20:39.489 --> 20:43.035
Make instruments that
trigger different tones
and frequencies.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.829
To summon, entrance...

20:45.913 --> 20:47.247
And kill.

20:47.372 --> 20:48.415
You guys really believe

20:48.498 --> 20:51.126
that cheap parlor trick's
a real enchantment?

20:51.919 --> 20:54.546
Some type of audio hypnosis,
come on.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.256
I've seen better
magic acts in Vegas.

20:56.340 --> 20:57.841
Wait, wait, wait.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.512
These foundations...

21:17.486 --> 21:18.695
Okay.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.531
Let's do this.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.452
Ah.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.252
Sara?

22:24.302 --> 22:25.512
She's alive.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.531
Huh?

22:45.615 --> 22:47.492
We're not alone.

22:52.831 --> 22:54.207
Oh, damn.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.049
Lieutenant, hurry!

23:02.632 --> 23:03.759
Hey!

23:09.014 --> 23:11.308
He's fast.
He's too fast.

23:11.683 --> 23:12.684
Come on.

23:13.310 --> 23:14.561
This isn't working!

23:15.270 --> 23:16.313
Hawley!

23:16.480 --> 23:17.773
What the hell?

23:41.421 --> 23:42.422
Go!

23:43.340 --> 23:44.591
Shakespeare!

23:50.514 --> 23:52.182
Move!

24:07.948 --> 24:09.157
Crane.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.119
Come on!
Quickly, before he follows.

24:23.505 --> 24:25.549
All right. All right.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.051
Lieutenant.
Mmm-hmm.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.764
Okay, sweetheart,
you're going home now.

24:34.099 --> 24:36.601
I can't remember
how I got there.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.149
We get her back home,

24:42.941 --> 24:45.819
load up on ammo,
get back here
and take that thing down.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.320
Without question.

24:47.404 --> 24:49.156
That explosion would
merely have slowed him down.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.323
Cool.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.576
You guys can let me know
how that turns out.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.952
The flute?

24:55.328 --> 24:57.497
After everything
we've seen?

24:57.581 --> 25:00.375
Unless you want to
discuss a new fee
structure for my services,

25:00.458 --> 25:02.961
yes, I am deeply uninterested
in hunting that thing down.

25:03.044 --> 25:06.381
I was right. You are
a self-serving reprobate.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.383
We made a deal, okay?

25:08.466 --> 25:09.968
You don't like
how this went down,

25:10.051 --> 25:12.053
guess what,
I don't do refunds.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.682
Kid's safe.
I call that a win.

25:17.392 --> 25:20.687
You two want to get
yourselves killed,
that's where I get off.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.272
Hawley, there isn't
a choice here.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.442
The evil we face is real.
It exists.

25:27.444 --> 25:28.737
Does this mean
nothing to you?

25:28.820 --> 25:32.449
It means
business is booming.
End of sentence.

25:33.742 --> 25:37.370
So the Piper's a real monster.
That's pretty messed up.

25:37.454 --> 25:39.748
Is it gonna haunt me?
Definitely.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.374
That's why God
created the shot glass.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.500
Oh, you...

25:42.584 --> 25:45.420
This thing is a part
of a bigger picture.
The End of Days.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.797
End of Days?
Which version?

25:48.548 --> 25:50.217
I've heard at least
200 of them.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.303
Each complete
with their own rare

25:53.386 --> 25:55.263
and very expensive
collectables.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.559
The flute.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.437
Forget about him, Lieutenant.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.649
The only thing
this mercenary
cares for is money.

26:06.149 --> 26:09.653
You do your
profession proud, privateer.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.406
Yeah, I was hoping
you were better than this.

26:13.490 --> 26:16.993
You gonna keep
your end of the deal,
or do we have a problem?

26:18.161 --> 26:19.663
No problem.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.464
Oh!

26:29.547 --> 26:32.759
In all the excitement,
looks like it was damaged.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.681
There is no way

26:37.847 --> 26:40.016
we were giving you
a weapon
that powerful intact.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.353
Guess I don't
do refunds either.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.191
Good luck in
the next round.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.485
See you around, kid.

27:24.394 --> 27:27.147
Baby, you're all right.
You're all right.

27:29.316 --> 27:30.650
Where did you find her?

27:30.734 --> 27:34.571
About three miles
into the North Woods,
by Havemeyer Falls.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.573
Someone took her.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.409
We have more units
on their way.

27:39.534 --> 27:40.994
They're setting up
a perimeter.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.954
Stay inside, you'll be safe.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.707
And I swear this
will be over soon.

27:47.250 --> 27:50.712
Thank you both, so much.
Thank you.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.256
It's over.

27:57.260 --> 28:00.555
You kept your promise.
Saved the child.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.976
Not until we finish the job.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.688
You ready for this?

28:08.772 --> 28:10.607
He's an expert swordsman.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.026
Perhaps the best
I've seen.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.487
He caught me off guard.
That will not happen again.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.907
Which is why
we need these.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.243
Noise-canceling earbuds.

28:22.327 --> 28:24.287
Keep us from getting affected
by the Piper's weapons.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.957
What possible defense could
something so small provide?

28:34.839 --> 28:36.383
Incredible.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.762
We'll be able to take him.

28:42.305 --> 28:45.725
I said, if we keep
those in when he
starts using that staff,

28:45.809 --> 28:47.018
we have a chance.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.606
This may seem
an odd query,

28:51.898 --> 28:53.149
but Mrs. Lancaster's reaction

28:53.233 --> 28:55.902
when we delivered Miss Sara
safely to her arms...

28:55.985 --> 28:57.320
Disappointment?

28:57.404 --> 28:59.072
The woman's raison d'etre
is protecting children,

28:59.155 --> 29:01.574
yet she showed
no sign of relief.

29:01.658 --> 29:05.912
If someone rescued my child,
I'd be overjoyed, exuberant.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.997
Right now, our focus
is to kill that thing

29:08.164 --> 29:10.166
before it comes
looking for its prey.

29:10.875 --> 29:13.169
Hawley mentioned
that the Piper had been

29:13.294 --> 29:15.588
taking Lancaster girls
for centuries.

29:15.672 --> 29:16.673
Uh...

29:17.674 --> 29:19.092
Lieutenant?

29:19.592 --> 29:21.845
If you would perform
the logging ceremony.

29:24.389 --> 29:25.682
Okay.

29:27.725 --> 29:29.477
Lancaster family.

29:29.853 --> 29:31.855
Keyword, "Abductions."

29:33.648 --> 29:37.235
Okay, as far back
as town records go,

29:38.194 --> 29:41.448
every generation,
a Lancaster girl's
gone missing.

29:42.198 --> 29:45.076
Each on her tenth birthday,
like Hawley said.

29:45.869 --> 29:49.289
Including Beth's
older sister, Lucy.

29:49.372 --> 29:52.292
Up to a dozen girls,
over hundreds of years,

29:52.792 --> 29:54.419
all disappeared.

29:55.587 --> 29:57.005
With one exception.

29:57.088 --> 29:59.299
1936, a Lancaster
daughter disappeared.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.634
A search party
quickly recovered her.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.428
Only for the other
children in the family

30:03.553 --> 30:05.305
to die suddenly of
a mysterious fever.

30:05.555 --> 30:06.556
Crane.

30:08.475 --> 30:09.726
What if those deaths

30:09.809 --> 30:13.104
are part of the Piper's curse
against the Lancaster family?

30:13.688 --> 30:15.899
If the Piper is
denied his prize...

30:16.733 --> 30:18.485
All the children
in the family die.

30:18.568 --> 30:20.737
Mrs. Lancaster
adopted those boys,

30:20.820 --> 30:23.031
trying to avoid the plague
on her family's house.

30:23.114 --> 30:25.033
And then she had Sara.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.494
What if Mrs. Lancaster
believed

30:27.577 --> 30:30.079
there was no possible way
to avoid the curse?

30:31.915 --> 30:34.542
She'd be left with
a most horrifying dilemma.

30:34.626 --> 30:38.421
The only way to
save the other children
is to sacrifice one.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.441
Oh, my God.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.575
Richard, when did this start?

31:07.659 --> 31:08.701
Less than an hour ago.

31:08.785 --> 31:11.579
They were perfectly fine,
and then all of a sudden,
all this.

31:11.663 --> 31:12.956
The Piper's curse.

31:13.331 --> 31:15.333
If this continues,
they won't survive the night.

31:15.416 --> 31:16.709
Where is Beth?
She took Sara.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.545
She said she was gonna
meet us at the hospital.

31:18.628 --> 31:19.796
Richard,
stay with your boys.

31:20.213 --> 31:22.382
All right, son,
just breathe. It's all right.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.893
She brings Sara to the Piper,
those boys live.

31:33.977 --> 31:35.478
But if she
doesn't make the trade,
they'll perish.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.564
That's not gonna happen.
No.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.190
Are you serious?

31:39.315 --> 31:40.400
I'll explain en route.

31:40.483 --> 31:41.818
Now, in the interest
of haste, may I...

31:41.943 --> 31:43.236
Yeah.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.572
You drive. I'll try
to get a hold of Beth.

31:45.655 --> 31:46.990
Come on.

31:48.032 --> 31:50.076
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.793
Still not picking up.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.132
You stole the family sword.

32:04.674 --> 32:06.593
It is no mere sword,
Lieutenant.

32:06.676 --> 32:09.470
A Fishkill Bailey cutlass
would make even
the lowliest servitor

32:09.554 --> 32:11.931
the envy of the entire
Oxford Fencing Club.

32:12.015 --> 32:13.141
You want a rematch?

32:13.558 --> 32:15.268
Honor demands it.

32:15.393 --> 32:16.436
Sorry!

32:17.103 --> 32:18.980
Sorry. Sorry.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.523
<i>Jinba Ittai.</i>

32:35.330 --> 32:37.832
No! I don't
want to go any further!

32:37.915 --> 32:39.375
We have to keep going.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.670
I don't understand.
Why are we here?

32:43.254 --> 32:45.381
Mom! Tell me what's wrong!

32:45.882 --> 32:48.092
Beth. Let her go.

32:48.301 --> 32:49.427
Stop.

32:50.053 --> 32:51.095
Oh.

32:51.179 --> 32:52.972
Don't come any closer.

32:53.598 --> 32:55.308
What is your plan here?

32:55.767 --> 32:57.393
Take her deep
into the woods,

32:58.019 --> 33:00.146
and wait for
the Piper to show up?

33:01.731 --> 33:04.192
Try and kill him
before he kills you?

33:05.735 --> 33:09.072
Or were you just
gonna let him take Sara?

33:10.698 --> 33:14.494
You don't know what it's like
to feel this helpless.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.329
We will find another way.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.081
There is no other way!

33:18.247 --> 33:21.793
One way or another,
that thing finds
a way to take...

33:25.755 --> 33:28.257
When I was seven,
he took my sister.

33:30.635 --> 33:34.847
He takes one child,
or the curse takes them all.

33:38.059 --> 33:42.355
Abbie, haven't
you ever prayed

33:42.438 --> 33:45.650
for something from your past
to just go away?

33:47.860 --> 33:50.279
Refused to believe
that it's true?

33:52.740 --> 33:54.617
This is not who you are.

33:55.410 --> 33:56.953
Let me help you.

33:59.789 --> 34:01.249
My good lady,

34:01.332 --> 34:05.420
a great evil has taken
control of your legacy,

34:07.004 --> 34:10.591
and for your sake
and the sake of
all of your children,

34:11.551 --> 34:12.760
trust us.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.471
We can make this right.

34:17.765 --> 34:19.767
I didn't know
what to do.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.275
Oh, my God.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.237
Oh, Sara!

34:32.363 --> 34:35.533
Oh, Sara,
I'm so, so sorry.

34:39.537 --> 34:40.872
No! No!

35:09.901 --> 35:11.235
Finish it!

36:40.575 --> 36:42.076
No more kids...

36:45.288 --> 36:46.706
Privateer.

36:50.126 --> 36:51.377
I had him.

37:00.344 --> 37:01.637
Fired?

37:02.638 --> 37:03.806
Hmm.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.768
I've never lied
to you, Captain.

37:08.769 --> 37:11.480
A lie of omission
is still a lie.

37:12.148 --> 37:14.984
You are the biblical
Horseman of War.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.069
You didn't think
that was relevant?

37:17.153 --> 37:18.487
The signs were all there.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.574
You chose to
look the other way.

37:21.991 --> 37:24.243
People usually do
when it suits.

37:24.660 --> 37:29.248
But if you no longer wish me
to act on your behalf,

37:29.540 --> 37:30.750
I do understand.

37:31.751 --> 37:33.669
It will mean
cutting off the funding

37:33.794 --> 37:37.173
that I have
secured for your wife
from the Policeman's Board.

37:37.673 --> 37:41.969
And ending
the insurance payments
for Macey's medical needs.

37:43.888 --> 37:45.431
You stay away
from my family.

37:45.514 --> 37:50.186
And I would think that
your court hearing
will be delayed

37:50.478 --> 37:51.938
indefinitely.

37:52.647 --> 37:55.024
You won't be seeing them
for quite a long time.

37:55.107 --> 37:58.027
Why even do this, hmm?

37:58.986 --> 38:00.529
What is it you want from me?

38:00.655 --> 38:04.200
The question is, Captain,
what do you want from me?

38:04.825 --> 38:09.830
My only objective,
since day one,
has been to make things right.

38:11.540 --> 38:15.044
For what is war
but an instrument
of justice?

38:17.755 --> 38:19.340
Let me be yours.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.509
You are the enemy.

38:22.218 --> 38:24.470
You serve a demon.

38:25.513 --> 38:28.891
Your friends have
rather turned you around
on this subject.

38:29.058 --> 38:32.895
Ask yourself, have they
kept your family safe?

38:34.647 --> 38:38.025
Have they kept your child
from the clutches of a demon?

38:38.818 --> 38:41.237
Have Abigail Mills
and Ichabod Crane done

38:41.320 --> 38:45.032
anything but bring misery
and suffering to your life?

38:47.994 --> 38:49.912
You need some
time to think.

38:50.246 --> 38:51.706
Take it.

38:56.627 --> 38:58.587
I am but a phone call away.

39:00.423 --> 39:01.465
Hey.

39:06.679 --> 39:08.597
What have you done to me?

39:09.265 --> 39:13.310
I suggest, Captain,
that you take solace
in the teachings of the Bible.

39:16.564 --> 39:18.941
<i>You'll find Ezekiel 18:4</i>

39:20.151 --> 39:21.902
<i>quite enlightening.</i>

39:29.827 --> 39:31.037
Here's a pen.

39:31.287 --> 39:32.329
Ow!

39:32.413 --> 39:33.956
Oh, I'm so sorry.

39:38.044 --> 39:40.796
I signed in blood
that you took my soul.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.733
Sadistic larceny.

40:01.150 --> 40:02.985
This is typical
of the Italians.

40:03.069 --> 40:04.987
A gaudy hillock
of overheated milk

40:05.154 --> 40:07.073
atop a thimble's
worth of coffee.

40:07.156 --> 40:11.035
And the cost equal to
three Tennessee stallions.

40:12.328 --> 40:13.662
Well...

40:18.000 --> 40:19.335
Oh, my.

40:20.878 --> 40:23.172
I can see why this
might be popular.

40:23.339 --> 40:25.091
I can't with you...
Come here.

40:26.801 --> 40:28.385
Oh.
Yeah.

40:32.348 --> 40:33.516
Thank you.

40:35.559 --> 40:38.270
It does seem fitting
that a creation of
Moloch's would inflict

40:38.354 --> 40:41.357
such a Hobson's choice
on an innocent family.

40:41.607 --> 40:44.193
She was damned
any path she chose.

40:45.361 --> 40:48.531
Which is why what
we did is a big save.

40:50.366 --> 40:51.450
Miss Mills?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.662
Are you gloating?

40:56.831 --> 40:59.708
We saved lives,
ended a curse.

41:02.419 --> 41:03.879
We made it right.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.133
Well, our respite is over.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.552
Let's get back to work.

41:09.718 --> 41:11.554
We have a war to win.

41:15.432 --> 41:17.685
It's hot under the foam.
Crane? Crane?

41:26.443 --> 41:28.070
Nicholas Hawley?

41:29.613 --> 41:32.324
Only my mother and people
with warrants call me that.

41:32.408 --> 41:33.742
You have it?

41:38.497 --> 41:42.293
The thing is,
it got a little
damaged in transit.

41:43.419 --> 41:45.004
As in broken.

41:45.087 --> 41:49.091
Now, I know we made a deal,
but this was not an easy job.

41:49.258 --> 41:51.802
Check your account.
It's already done.

41:53.429 --> 41:57.099
On behalf of my buyer,
I thank you, Mr. Hawley.

42:01.562 --> 42:03.272
That went well.

42:09.862 --> 42:11.572
As requested, sir.

43:04.166 --> 43:05.793
It's perfect.
