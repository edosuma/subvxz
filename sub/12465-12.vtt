WEBVTT

00:04.905 --> 00:07.773
Students of
ridgewood high,

00:07.775 --> 00:09.541
For our big game
against the ravens,

00:09.543 --> 00:11.143
We are excited

00:11.144 --> 00:12.744
To have our captain
back from her injury.

00:12.747 --> 00:14.313
Maddie rooney!

00:14.315 --> 00:16.782
( cheering )

00:16.784 --> 00:17.950
Hey!

00:17.952 --> 00:20.352
Willow wasn't finished!

00:22.256 --> 00:24.390
Take it away, mads.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.191
Thanks, willow,
and thank you--

00:26.193 --> 00:27.393
This is where
you clap!

00:27.395 --> 00:30.329
( cheering resumes )

00:30.331 --> 00:32.448
Thanks, willow.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.566
And thank you
so much for carrying
the team when i was gone.

00:34.568 --> 00:35.868
She didn't
carry the team,

00:35.870 --> 00:37.269
We take a bus.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.472
It's really nice,
except seat 14,

00:40.474 --> 00:41.707
Which is covered in tape.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.308
There was a bathroom
though, which was handy,

00:43.310 --> 00:44.576
Willow knows what
i'm talking about--

00:44.578 --> 00:45.978
Lacy!

00:45.980 --> 00:48.213
I think maddie
has something to say.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.448
( laughs nervously )

00:49.450 --> 00:50.983
Hey ridgewood!

00:50.985 --> 00:52.751
It's gonna take a lot
more than a blown knee

00:52.753 --> 00:54.586
To keep me from
beating those ravens.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.221
- ( cheering )
- go porcupines!

00:56.223 --> 00:59.925
( imitating porcupine calls )

00:59.927 --> 01:03.228
( trailing off )

01:03.230 --> 01:05.697
Yeah, we really need
to come up with a new
porcupine victory cry.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.900
And for our
big rivalry game,

01:07.902 --> 01:10.769
We bring out...
The ridgewood rock!

01:10.771 --> 01:12.638
( cheering )

01:12.640 --> 01:15.941
If anyone can steal this
from the team before friday,

01:15.943 --> 01:17.643
You will be excused
from gym

01:17.645 --> 01:19.244
For an entire week!

01:19.246 --> 01:20.279
( students oohs )

01:20.281 --> 01:22.581
Lady porcupines...

01:22.583 --> 01:24.283
Protect the rock!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.317
( blows whistle )

01:25.319 --> 01:26.518
Victory is mine!

01:26.520 --> 01:28.320
( shrieks )

01:29.757 --> 01:32.825
I desperately need
that get-out-of-p.E. Pass.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.827
Next week is
square dance week,

01:34.829 --> 01:36.962
And joey don't dosey-doe.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.997
Oh yes he "do-see-do."

01:40.901 --> 01:42.367
( giggles )

01:45.539 --> 01:47.022
Gimme that rock!

01:47.023 --> 01:48.506
I won't
stop trying
until i get it.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.641
It's behind
my back.

01:49.643 --> 01:50.843
One hug,
and it's yours.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.313
Round one: Lady porcupines.

Hi-yaa!

02:54.008 --> 02:56.742
You will not dine
on these brains, sir.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.878
Parker, are you still
playing that game?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.964
You've been playing
that since

03:01.965 --> 03:04.049
Before i left for
my "sparklecise"
aerobics class.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.085
Don't you want
to go outside?

03:07.087 --> 03:09.354
No, i want to
go to the bathroom.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.424
But i can't pause the game
in the middle of a level.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.759
Here, take over.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.993
Just hide and
don't get me killed.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.129
Zombies don't play, dude.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.467
Oh. So realistic.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.536
It's like i'm walking
through a forest.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.873
Ooh, it even follows
my movements.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.508
Oh, look at me.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.611
I'm walking down stairs.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.947
- ( grunt)
- oh, excuse me, mr. Zombie.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.648
- I'm just supposed to hide.
- ( moaning )

03:36.650 --> 03:39.051
Whoa, i said excuse me.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.753
- ( slap )
- ugh, i actually felt that.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.955
Hey, back off!

03:42.957 --> 03:44.122
Sparkle kick!

03:45.859 --> 03:47.526
Oh, i'm sorry,
did i knock off your head?

03:47.528 --> 03:48.860
Good. Fear me!

03:48.862 --> 03:49.962
A-five, six, seven, eight...

03:49.964 --> 03:52.064
And one, and two,
and three,

03:52.066 --> 03:52.998
And four, yeah.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.800
( mom grunting )

03:54.802 --> 03:56.068
What are
you doing?!

03:56.070 --> 03:57.636
I said hide!

03:57.638 --> 03:59.571
Oh, i-- i--

03:59.573 --> 04:01.206
( music crescendos )

04:01.208 --> 04:02.841
Whoa...

04:02.843 --> 04:05.811
You made it
to level 17.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.897
Mom, how did
you do that?

04:07.898 --> 04:09.982
Oh, i just did
some moves i learned
in my sparklecise class.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.568
Wait...

04:12.569 --> 04:15.153
You used your
old lady exercise
moves to clear level 16?

04:16.657 --> 04:19.024
This old lady could
show you some of her moves.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.960
( scoff )
i don't want
some of your moves.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.462
I want them all!

04:23.464 --> 04:25.063
Sparkle me, mom!

04:29.069 --> 04:31.036
( gasps )
guess who just got cast
in her first...

04:31.038 --> 04:32.938
♪ sequel? ♪

04:32.940 --> 04:36.174
I'm guessing
the only actress
♪ in this house. ♪

04:37.611 --> 04:38.777
Do you wanna know
what it is?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.878
Okay, i'm gonna
give you a hint.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.880
( clears throat )

04:41.882 --> 04:44.683
♪ mandy says your
muffler is a-okay ♪

04:44.685 --> 04:46.585
( snaps )

04:46.587 --> 04:48.954
My first big break was
singing in a local commercial

04:48.956 --> 04:51.156
For mike's muffler shop
when i was nine.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.558
To this day,
the roar of bad mufflers

04:53.560 --> 04:54.860
And the smell of motor oil

04:54.862 --> 04:57.896
Always gives me
that showbiz rush.

04:57.898 --> 05:02.134
Liv, i thought
you were gonna
like, focus on your music?

05:02.136 --> 05:03.268
Well, yeah, i am.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.603
But mike's
muffler shop called,

05:04.605 --> 05:06.038
And i felt like
i owed them one.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.040
( squeals )
i'm so excited!

05:08.042 --> 05:10.976
You're excited about
being a dancing muffler

05:10.978 --> 05:13.078
Chased by a badger.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.814
Okay, first of all,

05:15.816 --> 05:17.082
Mo the badger
wasn't chasing me,

05:20.487 --> 05:21.236
He was chasing
a good deal.

05:21.237 --> 05:21.986
And secondly,
i told them that
i would only do it

05:21.989 --> 05:23.922
If they cast
shana sowen.

05:23.924 --> 05:29.094
In second grade,
shana and i met at
shiny smiles acting camp.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.996
Shana was actually cast
in the muffler commercial first,

05:30.998 --> 05:33.532
But then she
got chicken pox,
so they asked me to do it.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.567
And then shana had
already tried on the outfit,

05:35.569 --> 05:38.136
So, two weeks later
i got chicken pox.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.638
I just always felt bad

05:39.640 --> 05:41.073
That shana didn't get
to do the commercial,

05:41.075 --> 05:43.208
And now i have
a chance to make it right.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.066
And don't worry,

05:45.067 --> 05:46.923
I will be done filming
before your big basketball game.

05:46.924 --> 05:48.780
I can't wait to
see you play now that
your knee is all better.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.216
Yeah. Thank you.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.051
- Yeah.
- It's uh...

05:53.053 --> 05:54.720
It's gonna be great.
( laughs )

05:54.722 --> 05:56.955
I'm gonna crush those ravens.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.657
Whoa, heh.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.025
Maddie...

06:00.027 --> 06:02.160
You didn't
say, "bam! What?"

06:03.864 --> 06:05.564
I've never seen you
miss a "bam! What?" moment.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.966
I've even seen
you "bam! What?"
a good "bam! What?".

06:09.002 --> 06:11.103
Right...

06:11.105 --> 06:12.605
Bam--

06:12.606 --> 06:14.106
Deep-dop, deep,
dop, doop, dop, dop.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.643
We both know
you're faking.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.312
Maddie...

06:20.314 --> 06:21.980
What's wrong?

06:21.982 --> 06:23.048
What?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.017
Nothing's wrong.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.985
This isn't about
your knee, is it?
'cause seriously, i mean,

06:26.987 --> 06:28.854
We talked to the doctor
and she said you're fine.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.439
And she also said
that she loved my outfit,

06:30.440 --> 06:32.023
So, she
obviously knows
what she's talking about.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.128
No, liv,
nothing's bothering me.

06:36.130 --> 06:39.131
I'm fine.
I'm ready. I'm--

06:39.133 --> 06:40.665
( gasps )

06:40.667 --> 06:43.101
Whoa, you are
so not ready.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.737
You just got schooled
by mandy the muffler girl.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.938
( laughs )

06:47.875 --> 06:49.074
What's that thing
that you always do?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.142
( gasps )

06:50.144 --> 06:51.243
Okay.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.187
( sniffs heavily )

07:02.189 --> 07:03.188
There it is.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.024
The muffler fumes of my youth.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.928
( sniffs )

07:09.930 --> 07:12.197
Oh, okay,
now i'm just dizzy.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.567
Oh, tooch, hey.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.802
Umm, before you leave,
can we make sure that
shana is the new muffler,

07:17.805 --> 07:19.037
And i'll be
the rusty old one?

07:19.039 --> 07:24.009
It's really
important to me that
shana gets the spotlight.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.544
Plus, i mean...

07:25.545 --> 07:27.078
I feel like i played
the shiny new muffler before.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.282
You know, i really wanna
challenge myself as an actress.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.318
So... Does this
look rusty to you?

07:33.320 --> 07:36.188
( makes squeaking noises )

07:38.292 --> 07:39.324
Liv!

07:39.326 --> 07:40.826
Shana!

07:40.828 --> 07:42.627
( squealing )

07:42.629 --> 07:43.829
I missed
you so much!

07:43.831 --> 07:46.164
Not as much
as i missed you!

07:46.166 --> 07:48.033
Shiny smiles
acting camp salute?

07:49.937 --> 07:51.636
Hey you,
what do you do?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.171
Drama, comedy, improv too.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.806
I'll sing, i'll dance,
i'll make you smile.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.392
Shiny smiles camp
is worth your while.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.977
Both:
And space work, and space work,
and space work, and space work.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.248
Put the groceries in the cart,
put the groceries in the cart.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.983
Lawn sprinkler,
lawn sprinkler.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.284
Jazz hands.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.922
Thank you
so much for doing
this commercial with me.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.924
I told them
i wouldn't do anything,

08:12.926 --> 08:14.259
Unless they
got liv rooney.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.896
I'm just kidding,
i'm not doing anything.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.448
( both laughing )

08:19.449 --> 08:20.999
Well, shana,
it is such a shame
that we lost touch.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.801
You know what?
Let me get your phone number.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.139
Wow, is that
the new z-phone 5000?

08:28.141 --> 08:30.275
Uh-huh, it's awesome.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.810
Do you like it?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.879
I hate it.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.114
I hate that
it's not mine.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.149
Had you going there,
didn't i?

08:38.151 --> 08:40.752
Who's the movie star, now?

08:41.788 --> 08:43.955
I'm kidding,
it's still you.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.658
I don't know, shane,

08:46.659 --> 08:48.159
Those are
diva shades
if i ever saw them.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.061
Love those.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.730
( honking )

08:55.135 --> 08:57.769
And mo is back too?

08:57.771 --> 08:59.871
Wow, he really
hasn't aged a bit.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.410
And lacy kicks off
the ball to rooney...

09:05.412 --> 09:07.078
Who drives
to the hole!

09:08.315 --> 09:10.081
Or passes it to lacy,

09:10.083 --> 09:11.082
Who passes it
back to rooney

09:11.084 --> 09:12.751
Who drives
to the hole!

09:15.022 --> 09:17.822
- Maddie: Yes.
- Or not.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.492
Maddie, you haven't
taken a shot all day,

09:20.494 --> 09:21.493
What's wrong?

09:21.495 --> 09:23.395
Yeah, something's fishy.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.030
Whoa, i just remembered

09:25.032 --> 09:27.132
Tomorrow is
fish stick day
at the cafeteria.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.434
Do you think
they're made
from halibut or cod?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.170
Oh, wait...

09:32.172 --> 09:33.772
Maddie, were you
about to say something?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.040
I really wanna hear it.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.341
Please, let it be cod.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.011
I--

09:40.013 --> 09:41.880
Okay, um...

09:41.882 --> 09:43.949
The truth is...

09:43.951 --> 09:47.986
I'm really excited about
getting back on the court,

09:47.988 --> 09:50.021
But i am just
a little nervous

09:50.023 --> 09:51.489
That i might hurt
my knee again.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.991
That's all.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.260
You'll be fine, mads.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.062
I just--
i don't know.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.230
I'm worried that if i get
in a game, i might hesitate,

09:59.232 --> 10:01.199
And, i mean, you know

10:01.200 --> 10:03.167
That if you hesitate for
even a second, you're toast.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.337
And, i mean, i also know
that i haven't played
in a while.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.907
What if i'm just not
as good as i used to be?

10:08.909 --> 10:11.009
Maddie,
you're our star!

10:11.011 --> 10:12.310
Once you get
in a pressure situation,

10:12.312 --> 10:14.079
You're gonna
react just fine.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.414
It's like one of
those things you
never forget how to do.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.050
Like, riding a bike...

10:19.052 --> 10:21.252
Or sneaking up on joey
when he's taking his
afternoon nap.

10:26.893 --> 10:27.959
Ha-ha!

10:27.961 --> 10:29.327
( coughing )

10:34.801 --> 10:37.135
Ha-ha, victory is mine!

10:37.137 --> 10:38.470
Hey, hens,
next time?

10:38.472 --> 10:41.072
Try less clucking
and more defending the rock.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.941
Hey, jojo.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.876
( sequentially )
cluck, cluck, boom.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.083
This makes me
slightly less
certain of victory.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.820
I shall find
a neighborhood cat

10:55.822 --> 10:58.523
To lick me clean
while i plot my revenge.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.132
( gasps )

11:07.133 --> 11:09.100
Sweet mother
of crushed vermilion.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.070
We have the
exact same lip gloss.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.106
No way. You wear
crushed vermilion
by lady love lips?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.941
Obsessed.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.945
It's so hard
to find here in wisconsin.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.614
I always keep it
right here in my bag.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.484
( laughs nervously )
right here.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.053
That's so weird.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.622
It was here
just a minute ago.

11:35.629 --> 11:37.595
Okay, so, i really
don't want to go there,

11:37.597 --> 11:41.066
But what are the chances
of us having the exact same
lip gloss color?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.934
Like, one in
a crushed vermilion?

11:44.337 --> 11:47.105
Is it possible that
shana took my lip gloss?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.341
Nah.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.143
( laughing )

11:52.145 --> 11:53.912
Well...

11:53.914 --> 11:55.246
Nah.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.083
Well...

11:58.085 --> 12:01.119
Huh, it's
gotta be in here.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.621
It's usually
right here next
to my phone...

12:05.525 --> 12:08.159
( deep gasps )

12:09.096 --> 12:10.328
What, what is it?

12:10.330 --> 12:11.897
My phone!

12:11.898 --> 12:13.465
( hyperventilating )
my phone, it's gone too!

12:13.467 --> 12:15.133
Oh, i can't
feel my fingers.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.035
Oh, shana, i can't
feel my fingers.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.136
I can't feel...

12:19.339 --> 12:22.207
Okay, so, my lip gloss,
and my phone,

12:22.209 --> 12:23.408
Which shana said she wanted,

12:23.410 --> 12:25.143
Are both gone.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.145
Normally, in this situation,
i would ask maddie what to do,

12:27.147 --> 12:29.047
But i can't call her,
'cause i don't have my phone,

12:29.049 --> 12:30.448
And then i can't call her
from the shop's phone

12:30.450 --> 12:31.916
'cause i don't know
her number and...

12:31.918 --> 12:33.151
( gasping )

12:33.153 --> 12:34.552
I don't know
anyone's number!

12:37.090 --> 12:39.124
Oh, oh! Ah.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.227
Call maddie!

12:43.363 --> 12:44.596
Call maddie!

12:44.598 --> 12:45.630
( dial tone )

12:45.632 --> 12:46.698
Whoa, it's angry!

12:46.700 --> 12:47.999
Ah, it's angry!

12:52.239 --> 12:54.005
Okay, and a twizzle.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.073
And a pivot.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.107
And a kick.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.275
Lengthen your
weight and sparkle.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.043
Sparkle,
sparkle.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.078
Honey, sparkle.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.613
Okay, say words
that make sense!

13:01.615 --> 13:03.715
Okay, let me show you.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.634
I wish i could say

13:05.635 --> 13:07.552
That i was having fun sharing
an activity with my son,

13:07.554 --> 13:09.087
But the truth is...

13:09.089 --> 13:11.289
I just love killing zombies.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.691
Parker, come on!

13:13.693 --> 13:16.060
You let those zombies
back you into a corner.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.262
Well, momma's
gonna fix that...

13:17.264 --> 13:19.063
With a sparkle,
sparkle, kick!

13:19.065 --> 13:20.632
Ooh, boom.

13:20.634 --> 13:24.102
Those zombies
just got mommied.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.270
Okay, mom,
i think i got it.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.138
Level 18,
momma needs some room.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.439
But i'm ready
to have my game back.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.508
Go away.
Ooh, that's my
new kill move.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.178
Yeah. And go.
And go. And go.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.047
I think some
neighborhood kids
are having a rock fight.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.215
Maybe i'll
go join them?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.017
Okay,
have fun!

13:40.153 --> 13:42.120
I hope i make it back alive.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.254
Love you too!

13:49.162 --> 13:50.762
Yup, that's right.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.530
At mike's muffler shop...

13:52.532 --> 13:55.400
♪ mindy says 80 bucks
is all you'll pay ♪

13:55.402 --> 13:59.771
♪ mandy says
your muffler is a-okay ♪

13:59.773 --> 14:02.106
♪ and shana stole my phone ♪

14:02.108 --> 14:03.808
♪ and that is not okay! ♪

14:03.810 --> 14:05.243
( bell buzzes )

14:05.245 --> 14:07.045
Great take, shana.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.180
Thanks. I'm drawing
from the same emotions

14:09.182 --> 14:12.217
I used to play a cupcake,
and it's totally working.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.117
( laughing )

14:16.690 --> 14:19.224
And now to find my phone.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.672
( inhales )

14:37.644 --> 14:39.310
( exhales )

14:53.360 --> 14:56.160
Liv, what are you
doing with my wallet?

14:56.162 --> 14:58.263
Uh... Gimme a sec.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.831
I'll think of something.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.102
My sunglasses
went missing
earlier, too.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.536
You know, the ones
you said you love.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.705
Ugh, i can't
believe it.

15:07.707 --> 15:08.773
You're a thief!

15:08.775 --> 15:10.541
Liv rooney's a thief!

15:12.279 --> 15:14.812
( giggling )
i am kidding.

15:14.814 --> 15:15.847
( laughing )

15:15.849 --> 15:17.081
No i'm not.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.217
Liv rooney's a thief!

15:19.219 --> 15:22.086
I'm the thief?
You stole my phone
and my lip gloss.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.521
What? How dare you.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.156
( growling )

15:27.394 --> 15:28.426
( both growling )

15:28.428 --> 15:30.161
Ooh!

15:30.163 --> 15:31.763
( growling )

15:31.765 --> 15:33.431
- Oh.
- Liv: Oh, oh...

15:41.808 --> 15:44.842
And lift, and kick,
and twizzle, twizzle, turn.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.878
Come on,
tighten those buns, ladies--

15:46.880 --> 15:49.497
I mean zombies.

15:49.498 --> 15:52.115
Mom, you've been playing
zombie gut-splash all day.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.551
You gonna
take a break and...

15:53.553 --> 15:55.620
Make dinner
by any chance?

15:56.890 --> 15:59.624
Momma's busy.
Make it yourself.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.360
I get to use
the stove? Yay!

16:03.730 --> 16:05.897
Oh, hello,
mr. Zombie, sir.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.398
Have you
met my friend

16:07.400 --> 16:09.334
Size seven
sparkle sneaker?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.705
Did someone order
a can of butt-whooping?

16:13.707 --> 16:15.873
'cause i brought
a whole case.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.143
I played outside
for 20 minutes.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.478
I got three
mosquito bites,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.313
Somersaulted
into dog poop,

16:22.315 --> 16:24.282
And was chased
by an owl.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.452
It was time to take
virtual reality back.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.587
Oh, hello,
little boy.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.439
I hope you
bought a ticket,

16:31.440 --> 16:33.290
'cause you're going
down to karentown.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.227
You're pretty tough
against the un-dead.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.862
Let's see how you do
against the living.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.799
- Hi-ya, hi-ya!
- Oof. Oh!

16:41.801 --> 16:43.634
And stretch,
and lift,

16:43.636 --> 16:45.203
And shimmy,
shimmy, boom!

16:45.205 --> 16:46.938
And slap,
and slap,

16:46.940 --> 16:48.639
And slappy,
slappy, slap!

16:50.310 --> 16:52.543
No!

16:52.545 --> 16:54.545
Ever been beaten
with your own spine?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.481
Gug-gug-gug-
gug-gug-gug-gug!

16:59.886 --> 17:02.854
( imitating whip )

17:05.191 --> 17:07.225
Wu-chu!

17:08.194 --> 17:10.495
As i ripped the spine
from my son's body,

17:10.497 --> 17:12.797
I realized that maybe i'd...

17:12.799 --> 17:13.965
Crossed a line.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.668
Oh, sorry, honey.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.404
Here's your
spine back.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.973
( grunts )
gug-gug-gug-
gug-gug-gug-gug!

17:23.977 --> 17:25.610
Thank you.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.244
Here's your
mother of the year award.

17:29.983 --> 17:33.217
Oh, i think i'm done
with this game.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.819
Probably best.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.221
But you had
a good run, mom.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.489
Thank you, honey.

17:38.491 --> 17:43.261
So, the stove
is super complicated.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.597
Who wants
ice-pops for dinner?

17:47.901 --> 17:49.901
You are never
moving out, are you?

17:49.903 --> 17:51.402
It is not
looking good.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.774
Give me back
my sunglasses!

17:56.776 --> 17:57.909
I don't have
your sunglasses!

17:57.911 --> 17:59.644
Give me back my phone!

17:59.646 --> 18:01.512
I don't have your phone!

18:04.851 --> 18:06.551
What is going on?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.256
I thought we
were going to be friends?

18:12.258 --> 18:13.257
I'm not friends
with thieves.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.525
I am not a thief!

18:16.463 --> 18:19.030
Girls, what is
wrong with you?

18:19.032 --> 18:22.266
And liv, why do you
keep texting me weird
stuff that i don't understand,

18:22.268 --> 18:24.936
Like "llk semicolon"?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.904
I barely know
what "idk" means.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.041
( chuckling )
lol.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.377
I can't text you, dad,

18:33.379 --> 18:35.012
Because shana
stole my phone.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.514
( phone buzzes )

18:36.516 --> 18:39.717
Well, you just
texted me a photo.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.385
What? That's impossible.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.324
Why is there a selfie
of a badger on my--

18:46.326 --> 18:48.326
( gasps )
mo!

18:53.666 --> 18:55.466
( growling )

18:55.468 --> 18:56.934
Mo stole
our stuff?

18:56.936 --> 18:59.337
Ha! I'm gonna
get my phone back.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.371
( snarling )

19:00.373 --> 19:01.539
Dad, get
my phone back.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.609
( snarling )

19:04.611 --> 19:06.377
Let's just
let him finish
his phone call first.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.148
Shana,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.916
I'm so sorry
i thought you
took my phone.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.718
I'm sorry too.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.121
And you know what, when
i thought you were the thief,

19:16.122 --> 19:18.523
I was really upset
because i was so happy
that we're friends again.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.991
And when i thought
you were the thief,

19:19.993 --> 19:21.959
I thought,
"she's a movie star,

19:21.961 --> 19:23.961
Why can't she afford
her own sunglasses?"

19:23.963 --> 19:25.863
( both laughing )

19:26.900 --> 19:28.666
I really want to hug you,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.433
But i don't think i can get
my hands around your suit.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.037
Bow and touch tailpipes?

19:34.908 --> 19:36.841
( giggling )

19:41.047 --> 19:42.079
I got your
phone back.

19:48.655 --> 19:49.987
All right, porcupines.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.389
One more minute

19:51.391 --> 19:53.491
Until we have
successfully defended the rock.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.427
Keep walking,
buster!

20:00.700 --> 20:01.933
Bring us home, lacy.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.501
No, maddie,
you should do it.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.769
You could use
the confidence boost.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.671
And my
self-esteem
is flying high.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.940
I found
a rainbow scrunchie
today, in chemistry.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.107
Check it.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.044
I was gonna
go all side-pony,

20:13.046 --> 20:14.529
But then
i decided it was--

20:14.530 --> 20:16.013
Just give her
the rock. Just...

20:16.015 --> 20:17.582
Oh, right.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.116
Here you
go, mads.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.953
Thanks, lace,
and great job, guys.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.754
I mean, if we work
like this against the ravens,

20:23.756 --> 20:24.922
Then nothing
can stop us.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.492
( porcupine call )

20:28.494 --> 20:31.095
Ha! Victory is mine!

20:31.998 --> 20:35.099
( dramatic music plays )

21:03.529 --> 21:05.730
No!

21:07.100 --> 21:08.733
( whistle blows )

21:08.735 --> 21:10.468
Time!

21:10.470 --> 21:13.471
Hey, rock's
right here, coach.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.839
Maddie!

21:14.841 --> 21:17.441
You ran, planted,
and pivoted on your knee!

21:17.443 --> 21:19.043
Just like you
would in a game!

21:19.045 --> 21:20.911
You're back, captain!

21:20.913 --> 21:23.114
You're right.
Ooh, i am!

21:23.116 --> 21:25.683
Bam! What?

21:25.685 --> 21:26.984
Ooh, that
was a really good one.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.185
Bam! What?

21:28.187 --> 21:31.789
( cheering )

21:33.092 --> 21:35.660
See you in
gym class, pardner.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.663
( screaming )

21:42.068 --> 21:44.802
Victory is mine.
( laughs )

21:46.706 --> 21:49.740
Great win,
porcupines!

21:49.742 --> 21:52.243
And our game mvp is...

21:52.245 --> 21:54.011
Maddie rooney!

21:54.013 --> 21:56.814
( cheering )

21:56.816 --> 21:58.800
Thanks, you guys.

21:58.801 --> 22:00.785
And it feels so good
to get back on the court
with a win.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.754
Nice work, ladies.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.022
While you
were winning your game,

22:05.024 --> 22:07.024
I had my own little triumph.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.760
I overcame my
fear of the oven.

22:11.531 --> 22:14.131
And i baked you guys
a cake to celebrate.

22:14.133 --> 22:18.269
A cake that will
explode in maddie's face,

22:18.271 --> 22:22.206
Covering her in a thick layer
of frosted revenge.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.208
Go ahead, maddie...

22:24.210 --> 22:25.676
Cut into it.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.144
See what--

22:27.146 --> 22:31.916
( all laughing )

22:36.556 --> 22:37.988
Happens.

22:42.095 --> 22:46.530
( porcupine call )
