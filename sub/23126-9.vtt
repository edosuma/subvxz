00:01.430 --> 00:02.522
- Previously on Being Human...

00:02.570 --> 00:04.299
- People don't come
to the old wing

00:04.330 --> 00:06.435
because it's haunted.

00:06.470 --> 00:09.269
- This is where people like
us come to search for things.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.836
- Are you attracted to me?
- Oh my god! Yes!

00:11.870 --> 00:14.578
(Gasping, growling)

00:14.610 --> 00:17.910
- What, what, what?
- I growled. (Growling)

00:17.950 --> 00:19.440
- That's what he goes through?

00:19.480 --> 00:21.016
- Every 4 weeks,
for the rest of his life.

00:21.050 --> 00:24.281
- I was getting bullied.
- This is Bernie.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.412
- Come on, loser!
- Hey!

00:25.450 --> 00:26.986
- Aidan saved me
from getting stomped.

00:27.020 --> 00:29.352
- I promise I will
watch out for him.

00:29.390 --> 00:31.381
- I've been watching
you with him.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.159
You must've been
a father once.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.363
They sent you that DVD
because they think I affect you.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.470
(Gasping)

00:37.500 --> 00:38.524
- What kind of animal

00:38.570 --> 00:41.039
gives this garbage
to a 10-year-old boy?

00:41.070 --> 00:42.731
- He didn't give it to me.
I took it.

00:42.770 --> 00:46.638
I'm sorry!
- Stay away from my son.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.174
** So, you're feeling
old today... *

00:51.210 --> 00:54.248
- (Aidan): That awful need
to touch someone,

00:54.280 --> 00:56.112
be touched.

00:56.150 --> 00:58.539
For some of us,
it just won't die.

00:58.590 --> 01:03.619
* Well, 25 is not exactly
dying age... *

01:03.660 --> 01:05.958
And eventually that need

01:05.990 --> 01:08.300
will take you to
your breaking point.

01:08.330 --> 01:11.163
* Still, you'd like
to be alone *

01:11.200 --> 01:14.898
* And spend your time
at home... *

01:14.940 --> 01:17.329
Frankenstein's monster,
poor bastard,

01:17.370 --> 01:18.963
couldn't stop reaching out.

01:19.010 --> 01:22.071
* Catch up on all
those things you've missed *

01:22.110 --> 01:24.101
* Since you've been gone... *

01:24.150 --> 01:26.244
- Get your skateboard!
- Stop it!

01:26.280 --> 01:27.441
- It's not that hard!

01:27.480 --> 01:29.517
- Dracula had it easy.
- Give that back!

01:29.550 --> 01:32.417
- He drank, he killed.
End of story.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.950
- Leave me alone!
- Get back here.

01:33.990 --> 01:36.357
- He wasn't interested
in being friends.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.798
- You wanna go, like,
call your dad?

01:39.830 --> 01:40.854
Oh right!
You don't have one.

01:40.900 --> 01:41.890
- Aidan!

01:41.930 --> 01:43.125
- Got any money?

01:43.170 --> 01:44.296
- Stop it!

01:44.330 --> 01:47.129
- I wanna tell you something
that just happened to me,

01:47.170 --> 01:49.935
but aren't you gonna go kick
their little sociopath asses?

01:49.970 --> 01:51.199
- I can't.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.777
- They've been
torturing Bernie all week!

01:53.810 --> 01:57.747
- You mean ever since his mom was
screaming in the street that I'm a pervert.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.145
If I so as much
as look at Bernie,

01:59.180 --> 02:02.946
she rounds up the vigilantes
with torches and baseball bats.

02:02.990 --> 02:06.585
* The bears will
keep you company *

02:06.620 --> 02:08.758
* When you are gone *

02:11.930 --> 02:16.026
* And this is all *

02:19.870 --> 02:23.431
* And this is all *

02:24.740 --> 02:26.435
Somebody call 911!

02:28.310 --> 02:32.099
* And this is all **

02:34.280 --> 02:35.839
Give me some room!
I need some--

02:37.990 --> 02:40.880
- Bernie! Please, God!

02:40.920 --> 02:43.787
- It doesn't matter
if you're dead, undead

02:43.830 --> 02:45.480
or somewhere in between...

02:47.930 --> 02:51.321
because it's you humans
that haunt us.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.830
And you won't let us go.

03:07.950 --> 03:10.214
(EKG monitor beeping)

03:27.270 --> 03:29.238
Did you sleep at all?

03:30.240 --> 03:32.504
- I couldn't.

03:32.540 --> 03:35.271
I just kept hoping
maybe he'd wake up,

03:35.310 --> 03:36.948
and we could go home.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.248
I could make him
a sandwich.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.315
And everything could
just be normal.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.626
His organs are failing.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.189
(Sniffling)

03:54.430 --> 03:58.060
- Cindy, I-- I am
SO sorry. (Sniffling)

03:58.100 --> 03:59.636
- Thank you.

03:59.670 --> 04:03.208
And for the room and
for getting the doctors here.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.060
- I could ask them
to come back

04:05.110 --> 04:07.374
if you wanna talk
to them some more.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.805
- I always thought
you can't keep them inside,

04:11.850 --> 04:14.774
wrapped up in blankets
like they're babies.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.142
They have to know how to play
in front of their own house.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.658
- Of course they do.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.853
- I could've stopped Bernie
from running into the street.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.484
I could've stopped
those little sons of bitches

04:25.530 --> 04:27.521
from hurting him.

04:30.130 --> 04:32.019
- I wish
I--I could've...

04:33.300 --> 04:35.564
done something and...

04:37.170 --> 04:39.264
I wish I could
do something now.

04:40.610 --> 04:42.704
- What could you
possibly do?

04:45.950 --> 04:48.578
It's out of our hands now.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.392
(Telephone ringing)

05:04.630 --> 05:07.065
(Whimpering)

05:08.070 --> 05:09.629
(Cries)

05:09.670 --> 05:11.707
>K

05:21.420 --> 05:23.843
(Birds chirping)

05:32.860 --> 05:34.396
- Nick Fenn?

05:34.430 --> 05:36.467
(Dog barking)

05:36.500 --> 05:38.525
You don't remember me?

05:38.570 --> 05:39.867
(Laughing)

05:39.900 --> 05:41.436
- Sally Malik?

05:41.470 --> 05:43.461
Intro to Marxism
and Class Conflict.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.501
Ah, hmm...

05:45.540 --> 05:48.373
Dying to stab a pen
in the eye of any jerk-off

05:48.410 --> 05:49.844
that won't stop
pontificating?

05:49.880 --> 05:52.542
- Bingo.
(Laughing)

05:52.580 --> 05:55.242
- Wow! I didn't realize
you were, uh...

05:55.280 --> 06:00.389
Are you dead?
- I like to think of it as forever 23, but yeah.

06:00.420 --> 06:03.788
I--I saw your note at the
hospital on the message wall.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.355
- Oh yeah. I left
that years ago.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.700
I mean, you know, it was for
the 'rents when they got here.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.619
- I should
probably do that too.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.890
- How was-- What was it?
China? Indonesia?

06:12.940 --> 06:13.998
- India.
- India.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.860
- I never got there.

06:15.900 --> 06:21.407
I got a boyfriend and, uh,
he didn't want me to go.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.999
And I was really into him.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.007
- Did it at least last?

06:25.050 --> 06:29.169
- Oh yeah. Boyfriend became
fianc, uh, bought a house,

06:29.220 --> 06:31.416
was gonna start a family.
- Wow!

06:31.450 --> 06:33.680
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, that's a serious 180.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.429
I, uh, vividly remember
a tirade against marriage.

06:37.460 --> 06:42.796
- Yeah, um, I guess
I rebelled against rebelling.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.264
- Hmm...

06:44.300 --> 06:47.759
- Anyway, uh, I--I never
heard about you...

06:47.800 --> 06:49.393
- Dying?
- Yeah.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.932
- Uh, a few years back.
- Mm-hmm?

06:51.970 --> 06:54.610
- Um, it was pretty hairy.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.972
- Mine too. Hmm...

06:57.010 --> 06:59.001
I guess that's why
we're here, right?

06:59.050 --> 07:02.145
Because it did not end well.
- Hmm.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.910
- So, we should hang out.

07:07.960 --> 07:12.329
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Do you wanna go, um, watch people drink coffee?

07:12.360 --> 07:13.919
(Clears throat) - Normally
a specialty of mine,

07:13.960 --> 07:16.292
but, uh, I gotta go.

07:16.330 --> 07:17.297
- Oh.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.891
- I'm here most days.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.208
Swing by.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.349
(* Trumpets on TV *)

07:42.390 --> 07:43.687
(Metal slicing)

07:43.730 --> 07:44.856
- Oh really?

07:44.890 --> 07:47.450
Do they have to show the
bloody heads flying at us?

07:47.500 --> 07:50.526
- Says the woman that's
obsessed with extreme surgery.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.232
- You loved it when they
rebuilt that guy's face.

07:53.270 --> 07:55.591
And the patient's
blotto on anesthesia.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.460
It's not like watching
thousands of Chinese get--

07:57.510 --> 07:58.830
- Mongol.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.575
They're all,
uh, Mongolian.

08:01.610 --> 08:04.978
This is the pre-inception
of the Chinese state.

08:05.010 --> 08:06.478
- You're such a nerd.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.817
(Laughing)

08:07.850 --> 08:09.375
- Yes, but I'm a sexy nerd.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.514
- So I'm like
a living oxymoron.

08:11.550 --> 08:12.551
- I'm gonna
get more popcorn.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.910
- OK.
- Don't pause it.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.258
- It's not that bad.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.450
Ow!

08:25.800 --> 08:27.097
Oh!

08:28.840 --> 08:32.434
- Somebody get disembowelled?
"Cause I do wanna see that.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.802
- Everything's fine.
- Oh my god!

08:34.840 --> 08:37.741
- Oh my god! No!
(Screaming)

08:37.780 --> 08:40.272
(Gasping, breathing heavily)

08:51.860 --> 08:53.897
- Nick was like a demigod
in the classroom,

08:53.930 --> 08:55.557
even though he
was only a TA.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.059
He was brilliant
and inspiring.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.898
- Are you in the Dead
Poets Society right now?

09:00.940 --> 09:02.260
- It's weird, right?

09:02.300 --> 09:04.667
He and I both die,
years apart,

09:04.710 --> 09:07.304
and then find each other again in limbo?
- You know what?

09:07.340 --> 09:09.399
You're a ghost
talking to a werewolf

09:09.440 --> 09:11.044
making an
egg-salad sandwich.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.141
I no longer compute
what's weird.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.342
So, back then,

09:16.380 --> 09:18.815
what happened
between you two?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.887
- Class, coffee,

09:20.920 --> 09:23.059
intense sessions of
editing my papers

09:23.090 --> 09:26.697
in his very small,
stifling office.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.789
- I thought Danny was
the love of your life.

09:28.830 --> 09:29.729
- This was pre-Danny.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.828
And if I hadn't thought

09:30.870 --> 09:32.861
that Nick Fenn was
so out of my league

09:32.900 --> 09:36.837
with his 5'11" Harvard
Kennedy school girlfriend,

09:36.870 --> 09:39.567
I probably wouldn't have
shacked up with Danny

09:39.610 --> 09:40.975
after 5 dates.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.603
- Five dates! Jeez!

09:42.650 --> 09:44.379
- I'm a serial monogamist,

09:44.410 --> 09:48.472
without the "serial" part.
- Me too. It's like an undiagnosed disease.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.114
- Nick was always the one
I was supposed to be with.

09:51.150 --> 09:54.313
He would have never talked me
out of moving to New York

09:54.360 --> 09:56.055
and working for the UN.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.819
- You were gonna
do all that stuff?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.589
- I was gonna try.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.519
- Is it totally crazy-town

10:01.560 --> 10:05.360
to pursue a relationship with
someone when you're both dead?

10:05.400 --> 10:07.391
- Honestly, I don't
know if any of us

10:07.440 --> 10:09.590
should be
in relationships.

10:11.310 --> 10:15.133
Anytime we try and connect,
people just get hurt...

10:17.850 --> 10:19.045
(Sighing)

10:19.080 --> 10:20.275
.0 WOrse.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.780
- Have you seen Aidan?

10:24.820 --> 10:26.413
- Not since he left work.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.418
I'm worried about him.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.954
- (Man): Good to
see you, Mr. Aidan.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.836
** You are so far
above the ground *

10:39.870 --> 10:42.669
* You are *

10:42.710 --> 10:45.964
* So far
above the ground *

10:46.010 --> 10:48.980
* You are *

10:49.010 --> 10:52.913
* So far above the ground **

10:56.480 --> 10:58.209
- The nursing staff
is pretty hardcore

10:58.250 --> 10:59.240
about their
theme parties.

10:59.290 --> 11:02.419
I'm gonna stay for an hour,
tops. Are you going?

11:02.460 --> 11:04.383
- I guess.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.682
- We should carpool.

11:05.730 --> 11:07.824
And by that I mean,
you drive,

11:07.860 --> 11:11.125
I get tipsy,
if I can in 60 minutes.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.140
- Oh, showing up
at a work party together,

11:14.170 --> 11:18.164
that's kind of a big move,
don't you think?

11:19.410 --> 11:23.005
- It's a ride. People at
the hospital know we're friends.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.144
- Yeah, but we're
not, right? Right?

11:25.180 --> 11:27.444
I mean, we're not
just friends.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.777
- Why are you
being so weird?

11:28.820 --> 11:32.017
- I'm not! Weird... Not!

11:36.260 --> 11:38.388
OK, actually, there was...

11:38.430 --> 11:41.957
I--I was...
I've been thinking.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.698
And I think
we should just...

11:45.730 --> 11:47.835
pace it down a little.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.964
- Oh!

11:50.010 --> 11:51.364
Wow!

11:51.410 --> 11:53.105
- Just a little.

11:53.140 --> 11:56.599
- Um, OK, I thought things
were going pretty well.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.176
- No, they are,
really, really well.

11:58.210 --> 12:01.544
I just wanna slow it down.

12:01.580 --> 12:03.514
- Are you breaking
up with me?

12:03.550 --> 12:06.884
- Oh god! No, no!
Not at all.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.049
- OK then, yeah,
I definitely missed a chapter.

12:10.090 --> 12:12.798
We went from animal sex
in the break room

12:12.830 --> 12:14.798
to a frozen pizza
and cuddling

12:14.830 --> 12:16.924
in front of a movie
that I had to read.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.495
I think that's slowing down.

12:18.530 --> 12:22.398
- It's just developing
like a Polaroid.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.431
- What?
- It's just...

12:24.470 --> 12:27.178
I just wanna dial it back,
a little bit,

12:27.210 --> 12:30.373
just so that we don't ramp up
and get too intense.

12:30.410 --> 12:33.209
I hope you understand.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.845
- It's murky,
but, uh, yeah,

12:36.890 --> 12:39.313
I think I'm beginning
to see the bottom.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.786
- (Chuckling): Great.

12:47.630 --> 12:50.429
Wow! That's really good.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.565
I know it's just, like,
cafeteria pudding, but holy cow!

12:53.600 --> 12:57.002
You know, I'm serious.
You... need to try this.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.805
You're not gonna believe this.
- I'm--I'm good.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.470
** Let's take it up *

13:03.510 --> 13:07.117
* Another notch... *

13:10.650 --> 13:12.345
(Laughing)

13:14.460 --> 13:17.259
* We used to think
that we would *

13:17.290 --> 13:19.349
* Throw it all away *

13:19.390 --> 13:21.495
* Excuse me, please *

13:21.530 --> 13:25.467
* But we're just paying
for your mistakes *

13:25.500 --> 13:26.990
(Groaning faintly)

13:28.200 --> 13:30.259
* We were friends *

13:30.310 --> 13:32.301
(Screaming)

13:36.140 --> 13:38.450
(Laughing)

13:46.220 --> 13:48.359
* Let's disappear
Let's disappear... *

13:48.390 --> 13:50.654
(Heart beating)

13:59.500 --> 14:01.389
- Aidan! Aidan!

14:01.440 --> 14:02.737
Stop it!

14:04.110 --> 14:06.670
* They took it all... *

14:06.710 --> 14:08.007
Get out!

14:08.040 --> 14:09.337
* And left us none **

14:09.380 --> 14:11.974
- Get away from mel!
She's mine!

14:12.010 --> 14:14.012
- You've had enough!

14:22.190 --> 14:26.752
(Bell dinging) - Uh, I tried for
8 months to get a reservation

14:26.790 --> 14:28.224
at this place.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.159
You're a genius.

14:30.530 --> 14:34.068
- Ooh, those look good.
- Oh, those shrimp make me wanna weep.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.829
- So where
do you hang out?

14:35.870 --> 14:38.032
- Uh... home.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.505
- Tell me you've at least
watched the Sox from the dugout.

14:40.540 --> 14:45.148
- Let me guess, you're also reading
the collective works of Aristotle

14:45.180 --> 14:46.773
and jamming with Yo-Yo Ma.

14:46.810 --> 14:49.370
- Oh my god!
Yeah, all right, well...

14:49.420 --> 14:51.548
Intensive Arabic
and Morrissey.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.456
I haven't hung out with
the great man, but you what?

14:53.490 --> 14:57.859
I did sit in the front row,
and he did sweat on me.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.289
- And--and how do
you take Arabic?

14:59.330 --> 15:01.628
- Uh, well, there's a class
that meets every day,

15:01.660 --> 15:03.162
and then I met
some Egyptian expats.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.124
They meet at this caf
on Beacon.

15:06.170 --> 15:09.800
- Yeah.
- They don't really know that I am there, but, uh,

15:09.840 --> 15:11.501
I talk at them.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.076
- So, OK, yeah,

15:13.110 --> 15:17.377
I'm a total slacker shut-in
ghost. Yes, it's fine.

15:17.410 --> 15:19.208
- No, no, you're new,
all right?

15:19.250 --> 15:22.242
I spent the first
6 months crying

15:22.280 --> 15:24.544
and haunting
my ex-girlfriend.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.481
- God! All these ghost perks
I never considered.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.352
Like, I've never
used my ghost powers

15:31.390 --> 15:32.994
to peep on naked people.

15:33.030 --> 15:35.249
- Seriously, Sally?
That's, like, Ghosting 101.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.723
Not even. That is...
It's, like, preregs.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.727
- I haven't.
Yeah, no, I have.

15:39.770 --> 15:43.104
This is ridiculous.
You're dead. I'm dead.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.199
I can stop trying
to impress you.

15:47.810 --> 15:49.471
- You always impressed me.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.604
- I did?

15:51.650 --> 15:53.470
- You know you did.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.482
- Um, did you...

15:58.520 --> 16:03.128
I mean, you knew I had a
violent crush on you, right?

16:03.160 --> 16:04.184
(Coughing)

16:06.430 --> 16:07.500
You OK?

16:07.530 --> 16:09.123
Nick?

16:09.160 --> 16:10.525
(Wheezing)

16:16.740 --> 16:18.663
- (Aidan): He saw me.

16:18.710 --> 16:22.772
And he wanted me to help him.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.278
(Aidan sniffling)

16:24.310 --> 16:26.779
- Aidan, this is
not your fault.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.039
- Oh no?

16:28.080 --> 16:30.390
That little boy
is going to die.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.286
- Except, you can...

16:33.920 --> 16:36.309
You--you could turn him.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.782
(Sighs, chuckling)

16:37.830 --> 16:41.789
- Yeah, look what that's
done to you and me.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.800
- We manage.
- I don't wanna manage anymore!

16:44.830 --> 16:46.366
- What does that mean?

16:47.370 --> 16:50.203
- Rebecca, what's the point?

16:50.240 --> 16:53.676
What is the point
of having this power?

16:53.710 --> 16:57.704
I could save that little boy's
life, but I'm not going to.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.380
(Crying): I'm just gonna
sit and watch him die.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.740
- Hey...

17:03.750 --> 17:05.080
Oh...

17:13.700 --> 17:16.123
- Nick, you out here?

17:18.069 --> 17:19.867
(Horn honking)

17:25.710 --> 17:27.576
(Muffled screaming)

17:27.609 --> 17:29.032
Nick?

17:30.040 --> 17:32.099
Are you...
Are you OK?

17:35.650 --> 17:36.913
(Gasping)

17:36.950 --> 17:38.748
Nick!

17:42.260 --> 17:43.659
Uh...

18:07.120 --> 18:08.474
(Sobbing)

18:32.640 --> 18:34.506
- Hey.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.571
(Chuckles)

18:36.610 --> 18:38.806
- I thought
you evaporated.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.916
- I was kind of hoping
that you missed that part.

18:43.950 --> 18:48.820
- What was that part?
- The big secret. How I kicked it.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.282
(Seagull squawking)

18:50.330 --> 18:51.729
I drowned.

18:54.030 --> 18:55.998
- I don't understand.

18:56.030 --> 18:58.089
- OK, um...

18:58.130 --> 19:01.498
A few years back,
I took a boat out.

19:01.540 --> 19:06.068
The water was rougher
than I thought. I capsized.

19:06.110 --> 19:09.432
My leg got caught
in the anchor rope.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.244
I couldn't get free.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.870
I drowned!

19:14.920 --> 19:16.945
Uh...

19:16.980 --> 19:19.620
And every day since then,
I relive it.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.015
- Why?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.380
- I don't know.

19:22.420 --> 19:25.082
Why do some ghosts get
their doors and some don't?

19:25.130 --> 19:27.724
I wish I could Google
this crap, Sally.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.524
(Chuckles)

19:29.560 --> 19:32.564
Some ghosts refer to it
as a death echo.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.136
- How are you so sane?

19:34.170 --> 19:36.935
I feel like I would be one
of those armless nut-jobs

19:36.970 --> 19:38.631
screeching by
the message wall.

19:38.670 --> 19:39.933
- At first, I thought
I would be too.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.870
But then, I was like,
I don't know:

19:41.910 --> 19:43.548
"It's 5 minutes
of my day."

19:43.580 --> 19:45.901
The rest of my time
is what I make of it.

19:45.950 --> 19:49.079
So, how about telling
me again about that

19:49.120 --> 19:50.884
violent crush
you had on me.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.217
(Laughing)

19:52.990 --> 19:56.358
- Uh, not that you noticed.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.755
- You're right.

19:57.790 --> 20:00.430
I was too busy wondering
why you never noticed me.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.997
- I really wish I
would've known that then.

20:05.030 --> 20:08.364
I would have had a
completely different death.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.287
Holy crap!

20:24.290 --> 20:28.056
I felt that.
This is crazy!

20:28.090 --> 20:30.525
We're ghosts!
- I know.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.690
- Like, right now, some jerk would
walk by and be like: "Get a room, slut!"

20:34.730 --> 20:36.596
"Don't need one, loser!”

20:36.630 --> 20:37.791
(Laughing)

20:37.830 --> 20:38.968
Sorry.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.764
OK...

20:40.800 --> 20:42.564
Wow.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.754
- You made it.

21:04.790 --> 21:08.658
- You don't have to check up
on me. Bernie's gone and--and...

21:08.700 --> 21:10.589
I've put it away.

21:10.630 --> 21:11.893
(Sighing)

21:11.930 --> 21:13.989
- I'm allowed to
worry about you.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.361
(Children playing)

21:16.400 --> 21:19.267
Life shouldn't have
to be this miserable.

21:19.310 --> 21:20.800
- (Bernie): Aidan!

21:24.680 --> 21:26.546
Aidan!

21:30.080 --> 21:34.290
- You're so cold.
- I don't feel cold. I feel a little weak.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.311
Rebecca fixed me.
- What did you do?

21:36.360 --> 21:39.489
- Bernie, maybe you should
go play on the slide.

21:39.530 --> 21:43.091
- Slide? I don't slide. I'm in the 4th grade.
- Oh...

21:43.130 --> 21:44.996
Uh, well...

21:45.030 --> 21:47.931
- I guess I'll find
something to do.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.159
- Bernie, wait!
- Aidan...

21:52.210 --> 21:54.133
- Are you crazy?
Do you know what this means?

21:54.180 --> 21:55.636
He could kill someone!
- Chill out.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.932
- You can't turn a kid.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.573
- I couldn't stand
seeing you like that.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.510
Bernie didn't deserve to die.
- And as a kid,

22:00.550 --> 22:02.416
he has no sense,
no impulse control,

22:02.450 --> 22:04.441
even before you turned
him into a monster.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.811
- I haven't been
feeding him live blood.

22:06.850 --> 22:11.083
Only hospital blood.
You and I can raise him right!

22:11.130 --> 22:14.054
- Rebecca, I--I don't know
if you're delusional

22:14.100 --> 22:16.922
- Or naive or
just plain stupid.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.860
- Or maybe I just
trusted you.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.835
You promised me that you
could keep us both clean.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.929
That we'd go away and
have a life. Remember?

22:23.970 --> 22:25.165
Yeah, sure!

22:25.210 --> 22:27.599
We can live forever,
but what is there to live for?

22:27.640 --> 22:31.804
- You can't experiment
playing house with a kid.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.670
- Whatever. It's done.

22:34.780 --> 22:37.010
- God, I...

22:37.050 --> 22:39.417
I did this for you.
You think I wanted to?

22:42.190 --> 22:44.420
Oh no!
- What?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.219
<i>Bernie... Bernie!</i>

22:51.270 --> 22:52.897
- (Both): Bernie!

22:54.200 --> 22:55.361
- Bernie!

23:05.410 --> 23:07.139
- Seriously?

23:07.180 --> 23:09.319
You're doing it
in the kitchen!

23:09.350 --> 23:12.342
We--we eat here.
I eat here!

23:12.390 --> 23:15.587
- OK, where am I supposed to
go, Josh? I don't have a bedroom.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.712
- I forgot
you can see us.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.285
- Yeah, and your sex cloud,

23:18.330 --> 23:19.820
or whatever this is,
it's gross, OK?

23:19.860 --> 23:21.021
It spreads out.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.721
I'm afraid to breathe because
I might inhale part of you.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.661
- Wow, Josh!
So polite!

23:25.700 --> 23:27.759
By the way,
this is Nick.

23:27.800 --> 23:31.168
- Hi.
- Hey, Nick.

23:34.510 --> 23:36.569
- He has girlfriend issues.

23:36.610 --> 23:40.001
- OK.
- Just issues.

23:40.050 --> 23:44.385
- Well, uh, I should
probably flicker anyway.

23:44.420 --> 23:47.139
Gotta, you know,
die again.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.079
- Um, maybe you could...

23:49.120 --> 23:51.760
Maybe you could work
through your echo here.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.349
- Hmm, OK.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.529
What? Like an
intervention/home detox?

23:55.560 --> 23:58.791
- Well, maybe you just need
something else to focus on.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.867
Hmm?

24:02.570 --> 24:05.562
- Muah! I'll be back before
you can explode a light bulb.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.635
- Try.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.909
- I...

24:08.940 --> 24:10.339
- Try.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.081
(Screeching)

24:21.190 --> 24:22.817
Nick, it's OK.

24:22.860 --> 24:25.454
I'm right here.
I'm right beside you.

24:25.490 --> 24:26.958
It's OK.
- What's going on?

24:26.990 --> 24:28.697
- Just get out!
He's drowning.

24:28.730 --> 24:29.822
(Gasping)

24:29.860 --> 24:31.919
- What?
- You don't have to.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.163
(Screeching) Just come
back when you're ready.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.804
(Coughing)

24:37.840 --> 24:39.535
I'll be here.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.670
(Sighing)

24:45.710 --> 24:47.974
- Your boyfriend drowns.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.516
Because he's the
ghost of a merman.

24:52.550 --> 24:55.451
- Give me
a break, Josh. Please.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.465
- Hi. What's your name?

25:13.010 --> 25:14.774
Want some Red Vines?

25:16.540 --> 25:18.702
(Heart beating)

25:28.060 --> 25:29.585
- Bernie!

25:29.620 --> 25:30.781
Sorry.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.481
Uh, sorry.
He--he can't have sugar.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.094
Bernie, you almost
hurt that little girl.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.996
<i>- I didn't mean to.
- I know.</i>

25:42.040 --> 25:42.939
But you have
to be careful

25:42.970 --> 25:45.268
because you don't know
how strong you are.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.800
Now, you can't--

25:46.840 --> 25:48.035
You can't run
off like that.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.401
Rebecca's freaking out.
We looked everywhere for you.

25:50.440 --> 25:51.748
- That girl's
heart was loud.

25:51.780 --> 25:54.249
I could hear her blood.
I could smell it!

25:54.280 --> 25:55.770
Am I, like,
a superhero now?

25:55.820 --> 25:58.812
- Listen to me. And you
have to understand this.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.887
You can never,
never, hurt someone.

26:00.920 --> 26:05.027
Even if you feel like...
biting, you can't.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.825
Because if you did,
they could die.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.191
- Like I did!

26:10.230 --> 26:12.119
- Yeah, Bernie,
you almost died.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.264
- Don't worry. I wasn't
gonna hurt that girl.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.335
She was nice.

26:15.370 --> 26:17.429
- Yeah, she was nice.

26:17.470 --> 26:20.269
- Aidan, superheroes
only go after bad guys,

26:20.310 --> 26:22.130
people who
hurt other people.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.444
- We're not
superheroes, Bernie.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.505
- I wish I was
like this before.

26:26.550 --> 26:29.918
Then those boys, they
wouldn't have messed with me.

26:33.090 --> 26:35.582
Aidan, I feel
kind of sick.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.988
- You're hungry. Uh,
look, I have to go to work.

26:39.030 --> 26:43.900
We're gonna find Rebecca and
she's gonna take care of you, OK?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.137
- So unless you're washing
your hair that night,

26:48.170 --> 26:49.137
you let me know.

26:49.170 --> 26:52.538
- That sounds suspiciously
like a booze cruise.

26:52.570 --> 26:54.129
- Hey!

26:54.180 --> 26:55.579
Hey!

26:55.610 --> 26:58.602
You guys planning
the office Christmas party?

26:58.650 --> 27:01.347
Or, I should say,
holiday party,

27:01.380 --> 27:05.840
so I don't offend my Jewish
Brethren, or the Muslims.

27:05.890 --> 27:07.949
Invinder's a Sikh.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.253
- Need some help?

27:09.290 --> 27:11.657
- I do, actually. Yeah.

27:11.690 --> 27:14.853
Mr. Beckley thinks
he has guinea worm.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.153
- Guinea worm?
He has HIN1.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.362
- Discomfort,
cranberry-coloured pustules.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.595
I don't know...

27:20.630 --> 27:21.938
- I'll come find you.

27:21.970 --> 27:23.665
- OK.

27:24.970 --> 27:26.961
- Hey, when I said,
"Let's take it slow,"

27:27.010 --> 27:28.978
I didn't mean go hook up
with Dr. Roofie.

27:29.010 --> 27:30.478
- You do not
get to do this.

27:30.510 --> 27:32.808
No, we're dialing
it down, remember?

27:32.850 --> 27:34.375
What does that
even mean anyway,

27:34.420 --> 27:37.720
except you're too much of a coward to break up with me?
- That's not-- No!

27:37.750 --> 27:39.388
We're still on,
exactly like we were,

27:39.420 --> 27:41.115
only it's just
less intense.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.389
- You keep saying that.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.127
What is less intense
than no sex,

27:44.160 --> 27:45.924
dinner out once
a week and no sex!

27:45.960 --> 27:48.622
My grandmother in assisted
living does more than we do.

27:48.660 --> 27:53.461
- It means that we'll just be
less invested in each other.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.389
Just less intimate, Nora.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.104
- So, to sum up, you wanna
see me as much as you do now,

27:59.140 --> 28:00.665
but care about me less.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.804
And in between, while
I wait for you to call

28:02.840 --> 28:04.171
and tell me what
DVD we're renting,

28:04.210 --> 28:05.871
I should get reacquainted
with my vibrator

28:05.910 --> 28:08.845
because I'm not to
see anyone else. Sold!

28:12.620 --> 28:15.055
** That's over *

28:15.090 --> 28:17.855
* That's over *

28:19.230 --> 28:22.621
* Honestly, you'll never have *

28:22.660 --> 28:24.970
* What I have *

28:53.360 --> 28:54.896
* Go ask *

28:54.930 --> 28:58.264
* Go ask my father *

28:58.300 --> 29:01.691
* Go ask, it's time **

29:03.600 --> 29:06.968
- Those 2 boys nearly had
their heads chewed off

29:07.010 --> 29:10.640
by some vicious creature
with tiny, sharp fangs.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.500
What could have
done that, I wonder?

29:12.550 --> 29:15.042
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out, Aidan?

29:15.080 --> 29:17.788
A spanking new vampire
running around the city.

29:17.820 --> 29:20.346
- I didn't want this.
It wasn't my choice to turn him.

29:20.390 --> 29:22.688
- There is always a choice.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.620
And there are rules,

29:24.660 --> 29:27.686
considerations and even
compassion amongst vampires.

29:27.730 --> 29:29.994
- You're lecturing me
about compassion?

29:30.030 --> 29:31.862
- Obviously, I have to.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

29:31.900 --> 29:36.235
- No, we wouldn't be here
if you hadn't turned Rebecca.

29:36.270 --> 29:40.138
- That is why we
don't turn children.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.599
- You turned Bernie?

30:04.630 --> 30:06.166
- No, not me. Rebecca.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.830
- And you,
you caused Rebecca.

30:09.870 --> 30:12.908
Oh! Oh my god, Aidan!

30:12.940 --> 30:16.376
How could you
keep this a secret?

30:16.410 --> 30:18.674
- Look, I didn't tell you
because you couldn't help

30:18.710 --> 30:20.007
and I knew that
you would disintegrate,

30:20.050 --> 30:23.418
just like you're doing right now.
- No! You only tell me things

30:23.450 --> 30:25.544
when--when crap
has already exploded!

30:25.590 --> 30:28.059
When it's raining
down on us!

30:28.090 --> 30:29.717
When you don't
have a choice!

30:29.760 --> 30:32.650
And now, 3 boys are
dead because of you.

30:32.690 --> 30:35.227
And Cara and Rebecca
and god knows who else--

30:35.260 --> 30:38.696
- I am telling you this
because you are my best friend!

30:38.730 --> 30:42.792
(Sighing) And you're
right. Yeah, OK.

30:44.170 --> 30:46.662
Things have gotten
out of control.

30:48.310 --> 30:52.941
And it may be that I have
to leave for a little bit.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.688
- We are best friends.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.760
But maybe it's better
if you do leave.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.319
(Footsteps going up stairs)

31:15.270 --> 31:17.068
- Please, please, eat this.
Eat it.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.068
Come on, it tastes good.
Smell it.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.238
Come on! Eat it!

31:21.280 --> 31:26.002
- I don't want it!
- That is the last bag I have. You have to eat something.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.348
- I don't care!
- It was good enough yesterday!

31:28.380 --> 31:30.644
- Hey! Rebecca, cool it.
- What has happened?

31:30.680 --> 31:32.990
Don't! You have
not been here.

31:33.020 --> 31:35.114
He doesn't even sleep!

31:35.160 --> 31:36.855
Listen, I can
get more blood.

31:36.890 --> 31:39.029
- I don't want it!
It makes me sick.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.495
It tastes like puke,
rotten puke!

31:41.530 --> 31:43.055
- I don't know
what happened.

31:43.100 --> 31:45.990
- I wanna see my mom.
I wanna go home.

31:46.030 --> 31:49.830
- Hey! I know you do, Bernie.
But remember what we said?

31:51.810 --> 31:52.959
Whoa!

31:54.040 --> 31:56.099
- Shhh!

31:56.140 --> 31:57.130
(Grunting)

31:57.180 --> 31:58.648
I cannot do
this by myself.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.876
You've got to
quit your job.

32:00.910 --> 32:02.969
You've got to be here.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.158
I'll take him.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.484
I'll take him now.

32:13.530 --> 32:16.124
Hey, Bernie... Let's get
you something to eat.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.969
- I won't drink
that blood. I hate it!

32:18.000 --> 32:19.889
- No, no. Something good.

32:19.930 --> 32:22.035
- We have to get out of
this city. Vermont or Maine.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.107
Somewhere where there's
not so many people.

32:24.140 --> 32:26.905
We can't stay
in this crawly motel room,

32:26.940 --> 32:28.339
brushing up against people.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.836
I can smell them
through the walls.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.269
- It's gonna be OK.
I promise.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.046
- OK.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.775
Bernie...

32:40.720 --> 32:42.609
I lost it.

32:43.190 --> 32:44.487
I'm sorry.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.556
- Hey, he just
needs to cool down.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.489
Um, you take a rest.

32:51.530 --> 32:53.419
You take a walk.
I got him.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.097
(Sighing)

32:59.240 --> 33:02.676
Hey, Bernie,
you wanna take a drive?

33:02.710 --> 33:05.270
Let's find something
to eat, huh?

33:28.970 --> 33:31.064
(Panting)

33:31.110 --> 33:32.930
- I've been thinking.

33:34.480 --> 33:40.203
You know my movements, the way I
shake the house, make the pipes explode?

33:40.250 --> 33:42.514
They're tied to my emotions.

33:42.550 --> 33:46.714
So maybe there's
something in you

33:46.750 --> 33:49.754
that's causing the echo.

33:49.790 --> 33:50.951
You say it's random,

33:50.990 --> 33:52.822
but it's gotta be
linked to something.

33:52.860 --> 33:58.321
- I used to think
that I was in this echo...

33:58.370 --> 34:00.566
because every night
I would die,

34:00.600 --> 34:03.729
trying to untie my legs,
swim to the surface,

34:03.770 --> 34:08.639
you know, like, beat my death,
and I never did.

34:08.679 --> 34:12.206
So then I accepted it,
all of it.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.617
My death, the echo...

34:14.650 --> 34:16.539
(Sighing)

34:18.550 --> 34:20.438
And it's still here.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.652
- Well, maybe you could
leave a message on the wall.

34:27.690 --> 34:31.194
And then find someone who
kicked the echo. Or maybe--

34:31.230 --> 34:32.594
- Sally...

34:34.139 --> 34:38.360
The only time that I remember
what it was like to be alive...

34:38.409 --> 34:40.435
is when I'm dying.

34:40.469 --> 34:42.871
- I don't even know
what to say to that.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.947
You do this on purpose?

34:47.980 --> 34:49.744
- Let's just forget about it.

34:53.650 --> 34:56.051
Sally, let me just say

34:56.090 --> 35:01.494
that you have been handling this like a champ.
- Yeah, I know I have.

35:01.530 --> 35:04.625
That's what I do.
I'm a real stand-up girl.

35:06.030 --> 35:08.237
I did this with Danny too.

35:08.270 --> 35:09.499
(Sighing)

35:09.540 --> 35:12.305
I supported him.
I put up with all his moods.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.536
I rearranged my
entire life for him.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.777
- Just don't compare me
to the guy that killed you.

35:23.950 --> 35:25.679
Being with you...

35:26.550 --> 35:29.053
<i>has made everything
SO much easier.</i>

35:29.090 --> 35:31.787
Just knowing

35:31.830 --> 35:35.494
that I can always come back
to you afterwards... (Sniffling)

35:35.530 --> 35:38.898
And you don't
have to fix me.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.489
Really.

35:41.470 --> 35:45.338
What we are, I think,
is kind of perfect.

35:45.370 --> 35:47.839
- It's perfect for you.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.645
"Cause I guess
that's my thing.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.369
My echo.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.117
I meet a guy.
He's great.

35:57.150 --> 35:58.811
I lose myself in him.

35:58.850 --> 36:01.558
He's gonna solve
all my problems.

36:03.690 --> 36:06.887
And then I just
disappear into his.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.369
And you don't even
wanna get better.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.937
- I guess that death...

36:19.240 --> 36:24.349
doesn't leave us a whole lot
of room for change. (Chuckling)

36:33.320 --> 36:34.879
(Sighing)

36:39.230 --> 36:42.655
- Really? Is there more to say?

36:42.700 --> 36:44.099
We're both adults.

36:44.130 --> 36:45.666
I think we know when
something isn't meant to be.

36:45.700 --> 36:49.034
- I don't want you to see Reed, or anyone.
- Oh, here we go.

36:49.070 --> 36:50.697
You know, you're
surprisingly Neanderthal

36:50.740 --> 36:51.810
for someone so young.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.502
- I'm not a jerk who doesn't
wanna get close to you.

36:54.540 --> 36:57.180
I want to be with you.
I want to be with you.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.440
But there's
something in my life.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.972
And it has nothing to do
with you or another woman.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.489
And I didn't kill anyone.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.545
- That's remarkably
not reassuring

37:06.590 --> 37:07.489
if you have
to point that out.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.919
- There's
something private...

37:10.120 --> 37:12.384
about me.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.858
And it needs
to stay that way.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.990
- For always?

37:22.040 --> 37:23.166
- I don't know.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.907
(Sighing)

37:26.670 --> 37:29.731
And I realize
that makes me seem

37:29.780 --> 37:32.374
incredibly unappealing,
but I don't know...

37:32.410 --> 37:35.710
I don't know
how else to do this.

37:36.720 --> 37:40.941
- Look, I--I
appreciate your honesty.

37:40.990 --> 37:44.051
But I'm not gonna
be that crazy,

37:44.090 --> 37:46.627
low self-esteem,
co-dependent girl

37:46.660 --> 37:49.357
who needs a guy
who's tortured.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.255
I'm just...
I'm not gonna do it.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.860
- I don't want you to.
I don't want that for you.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.095
I--1...

37:57.100 --> 37:59.102
I've hurt my family...

38:01.240 --> 38:04.471
by keeping this to myself.

38:04.510 --> 38:08.344
My fiance. It wasn't just that
we were young. It was this thing.

38:08.380 --> 38:11.543
** Let's go home together... *

38:11.590 --> 38:13.046
I don't wanna hurt you.

38:13.090 --> 38:16.185
I don't wanna
hurt you too.

38:16.220 --> 38:18.052
- But if you're not letting
me in, then what's the point?

38:18.090 --> 38:20.024
- No, I just--
I wanna protect you.

38:20.060 --> 38:22.859
- No. I don't need you to.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.597
You think I haven't seen
horrible stuff in my life?

38:25.630 --> 38:28.361
* Let's go home together... *

38:28.400 --> 38:30.129
(Sighing)

38:30.170 --> 38:33.470
* Let's go lose ourselves *

38:33.510 --> 38:37.970
* I'd give anything to you *

38:38.010 --> 38:42.220
* I do need you, it seems *

38:42.250 --> 38:46.790
* In a dirty movie *

38:46.820 --> 38:49.755
* Only you have seen *

38:50.790 --> 38:53.179
* Let's go home together... *

38:53.230 --> 38:55.221
Things took a wild turn,
didn't they?

38:55.260 --> 38:57.649
* Let's go lose ourselves... *

38:57.700 --> 38:58.929
- How?

38:59.930 --> 39:01.967
Who did this to you?

39:02.000 --> 39:06.164
- Let's just say I didn't
always go for the nice guy.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.903
- I never wanna let anything
like this happen to you again.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.543
* A Spanish burn *

39:14.580 --> 39:17.845
* This kind of love *

39:17.880 --> 39:20.440
* Can leave *

39:20.490 --> 39:23.710
* No evidence *

39:23.760 --> 39:27.856
* This kind of love
can leave... ¥

39:27.890 --> 39:30.200
- It's so quiet here.

39:30.230 --> 39:33.268
- So you and your mom,
you guys ever go hiking?

39:33.300 --> 39:36.270
- Um, no.

39:36.300 --> 39:37.790
She says that's why
we live in the city.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.308
We don't have to hike.

39:39.340 --> 39:40.603
(Laughing)

39:40.640 --> 39:42.176
- I agree with her there.

39:42.210 --> 39:44.941
But where else are
you gonna find deer?

39:44.980 --> 39:46.869
- But how are
you gonna shoot it?

39:46.910 --> 39:48.344
You don't have a gun.

39:48.380 --> 39:49.745
- We don't need a gun.

39:49.780 --> 39:51.748
We're gonna
catch it ourselves.

39:51.790 --> 39:52.882
- And kill it?

39:52.920 --> 39:54.456
- Yep.

39:55.290 --> 39:58.089
- But you said
that we can't kill.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.350
- Animals are different.
Humans eat animals too.

40:00.390 --> 40:03.621
Don't worry.
We'll be gentle and quick.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.595
See, if you have
to kill an animal,

40:06.630 --> 40:08.940
there's a way to do it so it
doesn't hurt. (Bird cawing)

40:08.970 --> 40:14.067
- Cool.
- Shhh! Look right over there.

40:15.810 --> 40:19.178
OK. Now, I'm gonna
go around.

40:19.210 --> 40:22.248
And if he bolts,
you run as fast as you can

40:22.280 --> 40:25.011
and just try
to hold him, OK?

40:25.050 --> 40:28.452
- Wait, wait.
What if he does get away?

40:28.490 --> 40:30.151
(Woodpecker pecking)

40:31.360 --> 40:33.783
- Just hold him.

40:35.330 --> 40:38.698
* Bruises only *

40:38.730 --> 40:42.894
* In the places
you can't see *

40:42.940 --> 40:47.264
* I'll leave no trail
behind me *

40:47.310 --> 40:49.779
* When I am gone *

41:08.960 --> 41:14.490
* Stay, and I will lie *

41:14.540 --> 41:17.339
* That's in us *

41:17.370 --> 41:23.275
* A heart beats so hardly *

41:23.310 --> 41:25.574
* A Spanish burn *

41:25.610 --> 41:28.944
* This kind of love *

41:28.980 --> 41:31.312
* Can leave... *

41:31.350 --> 41:33.239
(Door closing)

41:34.420 --> 41:37.856
* This kind of love *

41:37.890 --> 41:40.587
* Can leave **

41:47.800 --> 41:49.529
- Did you find Bernie?

41:51.170 --> 41:53.309
- I took care of it.

41:58.810 --> 42:01.040
- You had to.

42:09.990 --> 42:12.027
I'll be upstairs.

42:23.540 --> 42:25.133
(Crying)

42:35.780 --> 42:37.441
- Marcus...

42:38.790 --> 42:42.283
Thank you for taking
care of those boys.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.651
If I didn't
know any better,

42:43.690 --> 42:46.785
I would've thought
Aidan's son did it myself.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.889
- Whatever I can do.

42:51.970 --> 42:53.699
What was Aidan
thinking anyway?

42:53.730 --> 42:57.769
Trying to keep a child,
it's sick.

42:57.800 --> 43:01.338
- Aidan was thinking he could
start a family of his own.

43:01.370 --> 43:04.601
But we're his family,
aren't we, Marcus?

43:15.320 --> 43:16.458
Hmm...
