10:06.974 --> 10:08.473
He's dead, idiot.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.276
It's a gift
from Kim Cattrall.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.812
Well, I guess an ostrich
could be cool.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.947
He's not going to try
to hump my llama, is he?

10:16.916 --> 10:18.750
All right,
I'll take him.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.318
(Cleveland grunts)
Hyah!

10:22.788 --> 10:25.123
Now I've got a job I don't want.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.891
Thanks, Obama.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.126
(doors bang open)

10:30.997 --> 10:31.997
(gasps)

10:31.999 --> 10:33.498
I didn't hear
what you guys

10:33.500 --> 10:36.501
was talking about,
but I got a better idea.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.303
Ostriches.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.605
We're going to make
ostrich riding a new trend.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.173
It'll be lumpy.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.509
By the way, that's going to
be the new word for "cool."

10:44.511 --> 10:45.977
At least he's not
trying to push

10:45.979 --> 10:48.146
them wigs made
out of spaghetti.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.682
Oh, and about the
spaghetti wigs, check it--

10:50.684 --> 10:52.584
Parmesan hats.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.919
Oh, man.
That's so lumpy.

10:54.921 --> 10:58.056
See? The talking ostrich
knows what's up.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.959
Wait a minute.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.028
Hi. Cleveland Brown.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.130
Not the ostrich,
the person.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.999
And forgotten co-writer
of Kenny's biggest hit.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.034
You co-write, too?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.336
We should co-co-write
a song together.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.005
No.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.007
Yo, Kenny, I thought you said
you took care of this clown.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.977
Nobody takes care of me
but my wife.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.712
And even though
it's not as often

11:20.714 --> 11:22.013
as when we were first married,

11:22.015 --> 11:24.215
it's still a respectable amount.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.985
Probably just shy of
the national average,

11:26.987 --> 11:28.219
but I'm fine with that

11:28.221 --> 11:30.555
because I think people
lie in those surveys.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.557
Actually, we control
those surveys.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.226
Wow, you control a lot of stuff.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.295
Aw, man, you don't know
the half of it.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.064
Gimme a beat, ?uest.

Caw! Caw!

13:11.258 --> 13:13.892
Caaar!

13:16.128 --> 13:17.829
Phew.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.063
Yah!

13:19.065 --> 13:20.732
Relax. We're not here
to hurt you.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.433
We want you to kill
Kenny West...

13:22.435 --> 13:23.234
I'll do it!

13:23.236 --> 13:25.303
...'s career.
Oh.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.071
Can I offer you a drink?

13:27.073 --> 13:28.273
There's water in the fridge.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.575
I wouldn't trust that
Brita filter, though.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.277
It was here before I was.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.745
So was the baking soda.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.146
The kids are sick a lot.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.182
But yeah, I'll kill
Kenny's career.

13:41.921 --> 13:45.023
Why do you want me to kill
Kenny West's career?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.191
I thought y'all was...

13:46.193 --> 13:47.458
homies.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.860
We were homies.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.695
But then his ego got
out of control, man.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.130
And this is coming from rappers!

13:52.132 --> 13:55.099
We're trying to affect people
on a global scale,

13:55.101 --> 13:58.102
and he's going on about
ostriches, spaghetti wigs,

13:58.104 --> 14:00.305
and replacing his cat's eyes
with diamonds.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.974
Yeah, everybody knows diamonds
are for belt buckles,

14:02.976 --> 14:03.975
watches, and teeths.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.376
But we can't kick him out

14:05.378 --> 14:07.212
as long as he's the biggest
hip hop star out there.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.047
So we need you
to sabotage his career.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.048
Why me?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.616
Oh, Question-mark-love,

14:11.618 --> 14:13.985
do you mind not putting
your feet on the coffee table?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.653
It's not me.
It's my wife.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.555
Oh, sorry.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.658
Cleveland, you were there
in the beginning for Kenny.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.994
And let me tell you a little
something about these rappers.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.363
If someone from their past
accuses them

14:25.365 --> 14:27.031
from losing touch
with the streets,

14:27.033 --> 14:30.235
they'll do any crazy-ass thing
you say to prove you wrong.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.637
I mean, that's how come
I dress like a spaceman.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.038
To give me street cred.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.874
And you've got to trick Kenny
into making music

14:35.876 --> 14:37.041
no one wants to hear.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.309
Well, that's impossible.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.811
I'm a hit maker!

14:39.813 --> 14:41.813
(polka music playing)

14:41.815 --> 14:43.381
(sighs)
Excuse me.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.049
Junior! Keep it down!

14:45.051 --> 14:46.484
I'm trying to
have a meeting!

14:46.486 --> 14:48.653
Nobody wants to hear
your terrible music.

14:48.655 --> 14:52.257
Okay, so where can we
find terrible music

14:52.259 --> 14:54.726
that nobody wants to hear?

14:54.728 --> 14:56.327
What about the polka music?

14:56.329 --> 14:59.664
That's a great idea
featuring Nicki Minaj!

14:59.666 --> 15:01.232
If you get him to play that,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.768
ain't nobody ever gonna
want to listen to him again.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.236
And then he'll be out,

15:05.238 --> 15:07.739
which will free up
a spot for you.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.907
And it's ?uestlove.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.441
Question mark's
just for show?

15:10.443 --> 15:11.876
I'll do it.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.212
And if you're looking for
your comb, it's in your hair.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.014
Hey, Nicki. Bruno.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.749
?uest. Mr. I.am.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.350
Just want to give
you all my demo.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.453
You'll see that it's mostly
rumba beats from my Casio,

15:22.455 --> 15:23.755
but there's something there.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.526
A'ight, I'm gonna lay down
some "yeahs."

15:29.962 --> 15:30.962
(beat begins)

15:30.964 --> 15:32.931
(rapping):
Yeah. Yeah.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.365
All right, we got that.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.400
You know what?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.869
Let me do that second one again.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.070
(rapping):
Yeah.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.071
Nailed it.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.139
CLEVELAND:
Yeah!

15:41.141 --> 15:42.373
Cleveland, what are
you doing here?

15:42.375 --> 15:43.942
Making peace.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.209
I bring you...

15:45.211 --> 15:46.678
your next hit.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.115
That's just a bunch of kids and
a guy that used to sell me weed.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.216
Hey, Gary.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.384
Hey, Kenny.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.419
(quietly):
Talk later?

15:54.421 --> 15:55.987
Hell no!

15:55.989 --> 15:57.422
Look, Kenny,

15:57.424 --> 16:00.425
I know you're a superstar
and I'm a nobody.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.961
But you're forgetting something.
What's that?

16:02.963 --> 16:05.830
I know what the nobodies
on the streets want

16:05.832 --> 16:08.066
because I'm a nobody
like them.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.468
And nobody knows nothing
better than me.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.303
He's right. He ain't (bleep).

16:12.305 --> 16:14.839
Sorry, Rallo, I didn't
catch the end of that.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.407
You let go of
the button too soon.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.676
I only heard you
up to "He ain't (bleep)."

16:18.678 --> 16:19.644
That was all.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.112
Ah. Copy that.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.748
Kenny, you've lost touch
with the streets.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.918
And worse, the streets
have lost touch with you.

16:26.920 --> 16:31.122
And even worse, touch lost
have with you streets the.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.490
Hit it, Junior!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.325
(playing polka)

16:34.327 --> 16:36.494
Unh! You feel that?
Damn, that's dope.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.762
That's polka!

16:37.764 --> 16:38.763
Sh'mon.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.798
Maybe I have lost touch.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.533
I mean, people on the streets

16:42.535 --> 16:44.669
probably only got a couple of
American Express Black cards,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.170
not a whole suit of 'em.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.705
You know what?

16:47.707 --> 16:50.041
I'm gonna polka my way
back to the streets!

16:50.043 --> 16:51.776
There he goes. Sh'mon!

16:51.778 --> 16:53.811
CROWD (chanting):
Kenny! Kenny!

16:53.813 --> 16:55.680
This is it, Cleveland.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.882
If you pull this off,
you gonna be one of us.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.852
And this is just a taste of
the riches you gonna enjoy.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.521
It's a $15 iTunes gift card.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.690
You know how many songs
you can get? 15.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.392
Cool!

17:07.394 --> 17:09.761
How do we listen?
Where do I plug up the earbugs?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.268
Play BTO.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.739
Bachman. Turner. Overdrive.

17:22.641 --> 17:23.875
Aw, this thing's busted.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.176
Cleveland, there you are.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.578
I got something
I want you to have.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.714
It's the Grammy for our song,

17:29.716 --> 17:31.916
and it's just as much yours
as it is mine.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.918
It... it is?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.686
When you came to
see me yesterday,

17:35.688 --> 17:37.155
I realized something.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.924
I feel like everyone around me
just wants to bring me down,

17:39.926 --> 17:42.560
but you're the one dude
who's looking out for me.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.861
You believe in me.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.064
You mean, I "Be-Cleve" in you?

17:46.066 --> 17:49.867
I was purposely avoiding
saying that, but yes.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.402
You always did.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.037
Oh, fiddlenips.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.939
Kenny, there's something
I gotta tell you...

17:54.941 --> 17:56.908
Kenny, you're on.
No, wait!

17:56.910 --> 17:58.176
I think you're
about to look...

17:58.178 --> 17:59.610
German.

17:59.612 --> 18:00.878
Oh, God.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.547
Wait, wait, I'm not done!

18:02.549 --> 18:03.714
Huh? Huh?

18:03.716 --> 18:06.084
This is gonna be
a barrel of fun!

18:06.086 --> 18:07.418
Kenny, wait!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.520
Don't go out there!
I tricked you!

18:09.522 --> 18:11.756
Hey, look what
Nicki Minaj gave me!
