WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.037
- You know, I was thinking
maybe tonight, we try

00:03.071 --> 00:06.040
that tofu with peppers dish
we were reading about.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.008
- Ambitious. I like it.
- Okay, uh, fennel seeds.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.977
- Go.
- We need tofu.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.547
We need two red
and yellow bell peppers.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.015
(ominous music pounds)

00:15.049 --> 00:16.850
Oh...

00:16.884 --> 00:19.153
- Um, is there any way
that somebody could be, like

00:19.187 --> 00:20.821
watching us, is that a thing?
- What?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.156
*

00:22.190 --> 00:23.824
Oh, Christ, they found me.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.227
- What's going on?
- Uh, do you trust me?

00:26.260 --> 00:27.895
- Yes?
- Run!

00:27.928 --> 00:30.898
(intense percussive music)

00:30.931 --> 00:33.234
*

00:35.035 --> 00:36.204
(grunts)

00:44.912 --> 00:47.248
(tires screech)

00:47.281 --> 00:49.850
- Oh! What's the matter
with you? Are you nuts?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.018
- (grunts)

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
*

00:53.087 --> 00:54.355
(thud)

00:54.388 --> 00:56.257
(groans)
- Josh!

00:56.290 --> 00:58.092
- Jesus Christ.
- Honey, are you okay?

00:58.126 --> 01:00.094
- (moans)
- Who are you?

01:00.128 --> 01:03.030
- I'm Josh's stepdad, Tom.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.098
- Oh, my God, hi.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.533
- Bet that was hard to tell

01:05.566 --> 01:07.101
with this new hat
I'm trying out, huh?

01:07.135 --> 01:08.236
- Tom, what do you want?

01:08.269 --> 01:09.570
- Your mother sent me.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.572
Ever since
you two started dating,

01:11.605 --> 01:13.707
you've been on
her Most Wanted list.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.210
You can't get away
with having a new girlfriend

01:16.244 --> 01:18.546
and not bringing her by
for dinner.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.748
- Uh, yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.750
(groans) Uh, well, see,
the thing about it is,

01:22.783 --> 01:24.718
this week, I--
it's pretty hectic,

01:24.752 --> 01:26.420
work-wise, it's just
that time of year--

01:26.454 --> 01:27.421
(blow lands)
Ah!

01:27.455 --> 01:28.722
Okay.
(winded gasp)

01:28.756 --> 01:30.591
Not just work,
there's also--we have

01:30.624 --> 01:32.593
out-of-town friends visiting
that don't really know this--

01:32.626 --> 01:34.061
(blow lands)
Ah! Jesus Christ.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.229
- Josh?
- All right, stop.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.064
Just--please.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.732
Stop hitting me.
Look, we'll come for dinner.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.268
(upbeat music)
- Yeah, yeah, we can't wait.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.769
- Okeydoke!
We'll see you Friday.

01:41.802 --> 01:42.770
- Okay.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.104
(blow lands)
(gasps)

01:44.138 --> 01:47.107
(downtempo electronic music)

01:47.141 --> 01:48.108
*

01:48.142 --> 01:49.443
- Ah!

01:49.477 --> 01:52.646
*

01:52.680 --> 01:54.748
- (squeaks)

01:54.782 --> 01:56.450
*

01:56.484 --> 01:57.785
- (growls)

01:57.818 --> 01:59.820
*

02:14.134 --> 02:15.102
(upbeat music)

02:15.135 --> 02:17.104
- I am so excited.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.972
I finally get to meet
the famous Patti Greenberg.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.441
What you doing, Josh?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.475
- (pained chuckle)

02:21.509 --> 02:23.444
Uh, well, I read online

02:23.477 --> 02:25.779
uh, that yoga relaxes you,
so I tried doing yoga,

02:25.813 --> 02:27.448
but I injured myself
pretty badly.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.949
So now I'm just
trying to make it better.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.284
- Josh, why are you so nervous?

02:30.318 --> 02:31.652
- Uh, look,

02:31.685 --> 02:33.621
Lucy, I know
how awesome you are.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.490
But my mother
is a very particular person.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.626
And her house has, like,

02:38.659 --> 02:40.528
a million weird
little rules.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.496
- Josh, it's totally fine.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.831
It's gonna be cool,
we'll just--

02:43.864 --> 02:45.132
uh, we'll just
feel it out, okay?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.467
- You'll just feel it out?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.801
Are you crazy?
- They're just parents.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.136
It's fine.
- You don't understand.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.371
You don't know
what you're walking into.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.474
You don't know what
these people are capable of!

02:53.507 --> 02:55.476
I--I don't know how
to describe it to you, but...

02:55.509 --> 02:56.510
(dramatic music)

02:56.544 --> 02:57.845
But I know someone who does.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.012
Come on.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.648
*

03:00.681 --> 03:01.815
- You've come
to the right place.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.817
- Yeah, Liz is the, uh,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.653
world's preeminent authority
on our parents.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.388
Nobody's been
studying them longer.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.523
- I lived among them
for 18 years.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.225
Theirs is a crude
and primitive world,

03:11.259 --> 03:13.361
but in some ways,
it's beautiful.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.528
- Sounds fascinating.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.830
- But it's also very dangerous.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.233
They have many baffling
rituals and social customs

03:19.267 --> 03:20.868
that must be followed to a T.

03:20.901 --> 03:21.902
- Or what?

03:21.935 --> 03:23.504
- They'll label you as...

03:23.537 --> 03:25.739
"a handful"
or "not right for Joshy."

03:25.773 --> 03:27.741
- But we are not gonna
let that happen.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.877
Uh, right, Liz?
- That's right.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.712
Let's start with
the clippings ritual.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.514
Now, Lucy, if I were
to hand you this,

03:33.547 --> 03:34.848
what would you do with it?

03:34.882 --> 03:37.418
- (muttering)
- It's okay.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.891
- Oh, no.
- 'Cause it's garbage, right?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.726
- Yes.
To us, it is garbage.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.729
It's a random, useless article
from an old local newspaper.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.432
But in Mom and Tom's world,
that was considered a gift.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.233
- (inhales sharply)
So I should read it?

03:53.267 --> 03:54.702
- 'Course not.
You must simply recite

03:54.735 --> 03:57.204
the proper
ceremonial response.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.706
"I look forward
to reading this."

03:58.739 --> 04:01.542
- "I look forward
to reading this."

04:01.575 --> 04:02.876
- Yeah, that's good, good.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.278
That's good.
- Yeah? Okay.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.413
*

04:05.446 --> 04:06.714
- Taste it.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.716
(music pounds)

04:08.749 --> 04:10.418
- (gags)

04:10.451 --> 04:12.252
- (gags)
- It's called "ranch dressing."

04:12.286 --> 04:13.787
- I did not like that.
- No, none of us do.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.389
It's very thick.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.890
You just have to pretend.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.792
- Ranch is central
to Mom and Tom's diet.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.561
To them,
it's like liquid gold.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.596
I once watched them
take down an entire jar

04:22.630 --> 04:24.432
during an episode
of Blue Bloods.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.466
- Whoa.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.402
- Say you're washing your hands
before dinner.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.804
Which towel would you use
to dry them?

04:30.838 --> 04:32.105
(suspenseful music)
- I guess...

04:32.139 --> 04:33.941
Halloween, 'cause
it's the lesser holiday?

04:33.974 --> 04:35.242
- Shit. Shit.
- What?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.410
- The answer is neither.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.579
Patti and Tom
still follow Towel Law.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.614
This is the outdated practice
of displaying

04:40.648 --> 04:43.317
holiday-themed towels
solely to gaze upon.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.418
- So where do you
dry your hands?

04:44.452 --> 04:45.919
- On your jeans or whatever.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.087
- Why don't they just
put, like,

04:47.120 --> 04:48.155
another towel
in the bathroom?

04:48.188 --> 04:49.156
- You're still trying to force

04:49.189 --> 04:51.091
our way of thinking
onto their world.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.660
- Oh, my God, I hope
I remember all this.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.595
- You'll know it went well
if she lets you look

04:54.628 --> 04:57.264
at the family photo album;
it's their most sacred object.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.932
- Okay, it's 4:00 p.m.
We gotta--we gotta go.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.468
- I thought we were
going for dinner.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.769
- 4:00 p.m. is dinner.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.437
(dramatic music pounds)
Damn it. Shit.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.638
- Hi!
- Hi.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.273
- Get in here, you kids.
- (chuckling)

05:06.306 --> 05:07.274
- Hi, I'm Lucy.
Nice to meet you.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.442
- Hi.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.643
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi!

05:09.677 --> 05:11.445
- Hi. Lucy--no?
- (gibbering)

05:11.479 --> 05:13.681
- Okay, oh, there we go.
That's good. Hi.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.282
- Oh!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.451
Josh told me
you were a graphic designer.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.953
So I wanted to give you this.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.322
- Thank you.
That's--thank you.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.792
Uh, "Art Museum Attendance
in Illinois Remains

05:24.825 --> 05:26.794
the Same as Last Year."

05:26.827 --> 05:30.798
(tense exotic music)

05:30.831 --> 05:32.633
I--I look forward
to reading this.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.667
- (exhales)

05:33.701 --> 05:36.670
(upbeat pop music)

05:36.704 --> 05:39.339
*

05:56.023 --> 05:57.991
- And Frank's sons...
- Mm-hmm.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.528
- Danny and Jamie...
- Uh, Danny--uh, Jamie Jr.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.229
- Jamie Jr.
- Right.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.831
- He's a big man.
- That's the cousin Jamie.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.998
- Oh, that's the cousin Jamie.
- There's Jamie,

06:05.032 --> 06:06.500
Jamie Jr., and Cousin Jamie.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.535
- Okay.
- And you can tell--

06:07.568 --> 06:09.002
and Jamie Jr. you can tell

06:09.036 --> 06:10.571
'cause he's got red hair
like his dad.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.005
- That's right.
- Yeah.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.340
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.843
- So they're all NYPD.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.344
- Yeah.
- Well, I, for one,

06:17.377 --> 06:18.912
never mind a refresher
on the family tree

06:18.946 --> 06:20.347
of the show Blue Bloods.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.515
- No, that was a great story.

06:21.549 --> 06:24.017
- We had fun telling it!
- Yes.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.253
- I think this was
the best dinner ever.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.555
- I agree.
- Yeah.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.257
- And, as a matter of fact,
Lucy,

06:30.290 --> 06:32.025
I rarely do this, but

06:32.059 --> 06:33.761
would you have any interest

06:33.794 --> 06:36.930
in seeing
the family photo album?

06:36.964 --> 06:38.365
(tender music)

06:38.398 --> 06:39.533
- Yeah.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.734
Yeah, that'd--that'd be great.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.536
*

06:42.570 --> 06:44.037
- Thank you guys, love ya.
- Buh-bye.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.873
- Thank you, bye-bye.
- We'll see you soon.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.374
- Buh-bye.
- Buh-bye now.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.576
- That was really fun.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.944
- Ohh!
- Oh, Jesus...(muttering)

06:50.978 --> 06:52.379
(gentle guitar music)

06:52.412 --> 06:53.380
(both exhale)

06:53.413 --> 06:54.381
- We did it.
We made it.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.716
We survived.
- Yeah.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.384
- Like, I know my mother
can be a bit much.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.452
But we came out here.
- Mm-hmm.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.753
- They liked you,
and now,

06:59.787 --> 07:01.388
we don't have to
see her again till

07:01.421 --> 07:02.890
spring at the earliest.
- (laughs)

07:02.923 --> 07:04.892
Okay.
- So...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.460
I--I spoke too soon.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.629
- Yoo-hoo!

07:08.662 --> 07:10.764
You know,
I was just telling Tom

07:10.798 --> 07:12.600
that I had such
a good time tonight

07:12.633 --> 07:14.234
that I think

07:14.267 --> 07:16.069
we have to
do this again soon.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.905
- Yeah, yeah, definitely.
- Absolutely.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.406
- Yeah, at--at some point.
- Yeah.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.074
- How about this Saturday?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.743
- You--you mean tomorrow?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.745
- Yeah.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.480
- Uh, well, uh, you know,

07:26.514 --> 07:28.782
as much as we'd love to, uh,

07:28.816 --> 07:32.920
wake up and drive all the way
back out here tomorrow

07:32.953 --> 07:34.922
and just do everything
we did today,

07:34.955 --> 07:37.758
um, we--we actually kind of
had a bit of a day

07:37.791 --> 07:39.760
planned in the city, so...

07:39.793 --> 07:41.328
- Well, then
I'll come to you.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.430
- You--what?
- Big day in the city?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
Can't wait!
- Oh.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.600
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, see you.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.101
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.837
- Bye-bye, see ya.
- Bye. That was great.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.839
*

07:51.872 --> 07:54.474
- Bye. Yep.
Bye.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.510
*

08:01.515 --> 08:04.284
(gentle upbeat music)

08:04.317 --> 08:07.988
- Oh, Tom, it's been
the most wonderful day.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.190
Well, we hit the aquarium

08:10.223 --> 08:12.025
and then the wax museum,

08:12.059 --> 08:15.028
and then there was
a bus tour of old churches.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.164
- She's never gonna
leave us alone.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.966
- Actually,
she might if you just

08:18.999 --> 08:20.634
told her that
you need some space, maybe.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.335
- No, I--I'm just
trying to, like, avoid

08:22.369 --> 08:24.471
a proper confrontation
with her.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
- Okay, so...

08:26.540 --> 08:28.008
What are you guys thinking?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.510
Should we go out
for dinner or

08:30.544 --> 08:33.714
you want to squeeze in
one more bus tour first?

08:33.747 --> 08:35.215
- Hmm.
Bus tour?

08:35.248 --> 08:37.017
What do you--what--
what's your instinct?

08:37.050 --> 08:39.219
Actually, you know,
Mom, Lucy and I

08:39.252 --> 08:42.022
are both, uh,
pretty tuckered out

08:42.055 --> 08:43.390
so I think
we're just gonna...

08:43.423 --> 08:45.158
- (yawning) We're pretty tired.
- Crash.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.560
- It's only 6:00.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.229
- Nevertheless, uh,
we are going to sleep now,

08:49.262 --> 08:51.331
so I think you, maybe, just

08:51.364 --> 08:54.334
should probably...
(mumbles)

08:54.367 --> 08:56.737
- Say no more.
I get it.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.239
You guys head off to bed,

08:59.272 --> 09:02.242
and I'll just sit tight.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.177
Don't you worry about me.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.079
I'll be fine.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.583
- It's very bright.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.018
- I know.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.519
Just squint hard.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.254
We'll be asleep
in a matter of hours.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.089
- Josh, this isn't good.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.625
She's starting to
get obsessed with us.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.031
- It'll all be fine.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.365
- (laughing)

09:25.398 --> 09:26.600
- Yoo-hoo!
- Jesus.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.602
- It's me,
your number one fan.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.203
- Yep, why--what are you--
why are you here?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.238
What are you doing here?

09:31.271 --> 09:32.706
- Can I get a picture?

09:32.740 --> 09:33.707
- Oh, yeah--yeah.
- Yeah.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.108
- Is this annoying?

09:35.142 --> 09:36.710
Oh, oh, oh.
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.045
Okay, thank you.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.613
- Am I freaking you guys out?

09:39.647 --> 09:42.750
Because I'm like,
"Oh-ahh, I love you guys,"

09:42.783 --> 09:45.285
and you're like,
"Ooh, she's weird."

09:45.318 --> 09:46.787
- No, no.
- No.

09:46.820 --> 09:50.290
- I just--she has somewhere
that we have to be.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.793
- Of course.
I know how busy you guys are.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.795
(suspenseful music)
What's that over there?

09:54.828 --> 09:56.463
*

09:56.496 --> 09:57.731
- Did you just cut her hair?

09:57.765 --> 10:00.133
- I really am
your number one fan.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.568
(melodramatic music)

10:01.601 --> 10:02.569
- Whoa-ooh...

10:02.602 --> 10:05.739
- Ugh...
- What the hell?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.407
Josh, some of these
letters from your mom

10:07.440 --> 10:09.142
are really unhinged.
- It's not that bad.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.578
- This one keeps referencing
the day we become one.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.313
- Well, we just--
we won't reply to that one.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.448
- In this one, she drew
Christ upside-down on the cross.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.250
- She's just being a mother.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.619
- This one's three tickets
for us to see "Jersey Boys."

10:19.653 --> 10:20.754
(exhales)

10:20.788 --> 10:23.757
(intense percussive music)

10:23.791 --> 10:25.793
*

10:28.195 --> 10:29.496
(dogs barking
in the distance)

10:29.529 --> 10:31.665
- Josh?
You need to see this.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.834
- Shots rang out today
on Capitol Hill

10:33.867 --> 10:36.169
in a failed
assassination attempt

10:36.203 --> 10:37.604
on the president.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.339
The assailant
has been identified

10:39.372 --> 10:41.308
as Patricia Greenberg,

10:41.341 --> 10:43.510
a crazed stalker
of Josh and Lucy.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.345
BOTH:
Oh, my God.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.447
- Apparently, this
delusional psychopath thought

10:47.480 --> 10:49.783
her act of violence would
somehow get their attention.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.618
- Let me go!

10:51.651 --> 10:53.286
- Police say she was carrying
a copy of the book

10:53.320 --> 10:54.788
Catcher in the Rye,
as well as

10:54.822 --> 10:57.290
a rather dog-eared copy
of Still Alice.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.625
- Get in the car!

10:58.658 --> 11:00.627
- I did this for you,
Josh and Lucy!

11:00.660 --> 11:03.363
Did you get my recipe?

11:03.396 --> 11:06.366
It's baked
Parmesan-crusted chicken.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.136
(Patti shouting indistinctly)

11:09.169 --> 11:10.303
Soda crackers!

11:10.337 --> 11:11.638
- All right, enough is enough.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.140
You have to be
more direct with her.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.474
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.642
You're right.
You're right.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.676
- Parmesan chicken!

11:16.710 --> 11:19.046
- But, I will say,
it looks like

11:19.079 --> 11:21.849
the problem's kind of
resolved itself, so...

11:23.250 --> 11:25.385
(snoring)

11:25.418 --> 11:27.054
(bang!)
- Oh, my God!

11:27.087 --> 11:28.722
- Yoo-hoo!
(laughs)

11:28.756 --> 11:30.690
- Jesus Christ!
- I escaped!

11:30.724 --> 11:32.159
(sirens wailing)
(dogs barking)

11:32.192 --> 11:34.361
Now we can hang out again!

11:34.394 --> 11:37.064
- Mom, it's too much.
It's--it's too much!

11:37.097 --> 11:38.732
- What's wrong?

11:38.766 --> 11:40.400
- I don't want to hang out.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.535
Mom, can't you take a hint,
for God's sakes?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.704
- Oh, I thought
we were having fun.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.740
- I was not having fun.
I was pretending to have fun.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.742
You just--you follow us
around everywhere like

11:48.776 --> 11:50.177
some kind of freak, it's...

11:50.210 --> 11:51.344
(tender piano music)

11:51.378 --> 11:52.846
Enough.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.214
- Oh, I see.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.183
Well...

11:56.216 --> 11:58.351
I didn't know
you felt that way...

11:58.385 --> 11:59.419
about me.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.421
*

12:01.454 --> 12:04.091
I'll go home now.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.726
I'll just leave you two alone.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.562
(shackles clanking)

12:09.596 --> 12:12.599
(sirens wailing)
(dogs barking)

12:16.636 --> 12:17.871
- (exhales)
- Okay, you can do this.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.472
Okay, it's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.377
Yeah, you're probably right,
I mean, it's not like--

12:24.411 --> 12:26.546
it's not even like
I was that hard on her.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.381
Right? I--

12:28.415 --> 12:29.716
Huh. Yeah.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.419
They're probably
just around back.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.555
(slow bluegrass music)

12:35.588 --> 12:36.890
*

12:36.924 --> 12:39.426
Hey, Tom.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.561
- Lucy. Josh.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.063
- How's--how's Mom doing?

12:43.096 --> 12:46.599
- Afraid your mom
ain't doing so hot, Josh.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.601
Words you said
hurt her pert' bad.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.237
- (sighs)

12:50.270 --> 12:51.638
How--how bad is it?

12:51.671 --> 12:55.408
- Old Momma's heart
is broken.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.411
She ain't no good
to you no more.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.447
Hell, she ain't no good
to herself.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.749
Only one thing left
to do now.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.084
(shotgun cocks)

13:04.117 --> 13:06.253
- Whoa!
Tom, uh--uh--wh--

13:06.286 --> 13:07.420
where's Mom?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.755
- She's out in yonder shed.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.324
*

13:11.358 --> 13:13.093
- Is she frothing at the mouth?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.761
- She's got her night cream on.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.763
It's a special foamy kind
she likes to get

13:16.796 --> 13:19.632
from the high-end section
of Target or,

13:19.666 --> 13:21.601
as we like to call it,
Targét.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.770
Figure I'd--

13:23.803 --> 13:27.274
let her watch one more episode
of Blue Bloods and then--

13:27.307 --> 13:29.109
take her out
to the Yankee Candle,

13:29.142 --> 13:30.443
let her get to browsin',
and then

13:30.477 --> 13:31.678
shoot her in the back
of the head.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.680
- Oh.
No, no, don't shoot her.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.348
What--uh, there's gotta--
there's gotta--

13:35.382 --> 13:36.616
there's gotta be something
I can do.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.817
- No, no.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.452
She's my wife.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.487
I'll kill her.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.688
- No!
Okay, look,

13:41.721 --> 13:44.157
this--this whole thing
is my fault.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.792
I--I clearly
just should have been

13:45.825 --> 13:47.694
more direct with her
to start with.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.630
I--I should just go
talk to her,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.132
right?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.366
Uh--okay.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.303
(sighs and sputters)

13:56.336 --> 13:58.705
(dramatic music on TV)
- Hey, Pop.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.141
I know I've been the only
member of our entire family

14:01.174 --> 14:03.476
that's not employed
by the NYPD,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.145
but that's not the case
anymore.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.816
*

14:09.849 --> 14:12.219
- Hot dog.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.154
That means our entire family

14:14.187 --> 14:16.356
is affiliated with the NYPD.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.690
Congratulations, son.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.559
(gentle music)

14:19.592 --> 14:21.594
- Stay tuned
for more Blue Bloods.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.367
- How's my favorite mom doing?

14:27.400 --> 14:31.338
(tender music)

14:31.371 --> 14:33.173
I--I'm--I'm sorry,

14:33.206 --> 14:35.208
Mom, I never should
have called you a freak.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.677
- Well, that's not why
I'm upset.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.347
I'm upset because
my own son

14:40.380 --> 14:41.714
doesn't want to see me.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.184
- Oh, no, no, I do,
I do want to see you, Mom.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.353
I do want to see you.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.255
Just...

14:48.288 --> 14:50.357
not all the time.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.525
- Well, how often, then?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.727
Once a week?

14:54.761 --> 14:56.863
- More like once a month.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.533
*

15:00.567 --> 15:04.204
- (sniffs)
Well, that's not so bad.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.705
Holidays too.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.441
- Well, of course holidays too.
You're my mother.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.542
My mother.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.543
(gunshot)

15:10.577 --> 15:11.711
Right, he's--got a gun.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.246
- Whoopsie daisy!

15:13.280 --> 15:15.082
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh! (laughs)

15:15.115 --> 15:17.384
The hair trigger
on this thing.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.552
My God--hey,
Josh, Lucy, you're not

15:19.586 --> 15:22.222
driving by Presbyterian General
on your way?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.224
If you were,
I--I'd take a ride

15:24.257 --> 15:26.059
and maybe hop out
at the old E.R. there?

15:26.093 --> 15:27.560
I seem to have
obliterated my knee.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.396
- Yeah, we can
definitely take you, Tom.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.897
- Oh, should I grab
some celery sticks

15:30.930 --> 15:32.432
and ranch for the road?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.401
- Yeah, okay, that's, um, uh,

15:34.434 --> 15:36.803
yeah, fine, well, um...
(stammering)

15:36.836 --> 15:38.638
Uh, no. No.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.107
Actually, no,
thank you.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.774
Uh--Mom.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.577
I--I don't actually like
ranch dressing very much.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.778
(gentle guitar music)
- Huh.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.480
- Well, that's fine.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.149
More for us.
- Yeah.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.483
- So, uh, we'll see you
at our place,

15:50.517 --> 15:52.119
uh, next month?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.420
- I can't wait.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.088
*

15:55.122 --> 15:56.089
(gunshot)
- Oh, whoops!

15:56.123 --> 15:58.425
- Jesus!
- Oh, wow.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.793
I did it again,
right in the same spot.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.129
- Tom.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.097
- Yeah, I should not
have reloaded.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.765
- No!
- No.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.766
- See you soon, Patti.
- Okay, bye.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.101
- Yeah, see you soon.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.436
- Bye-bye now.
- Take care.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.104
- It's just one big
flesh tube now, huh?

16:11.138 --> 16:14.341
- Yep, okay, all right,
buddy boy, here we go.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.178
(dramatic music)

16:18.211 --> 16:19.846
- You've come
to the right place.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.848
Josh and Lucy's apartment
is a crude and primitive world,

16:21.881 --> 16:24.517
but in some ways, beautiful.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.286
Now, what would you say
if someone showed you

16:26.319 --> 16:30.123
these curtains and said
they got them for only $200?

16:30.157 --> 16:31.991
- Well, I'd laugh
and I'd say I could have got

16:32.025 --> 16:35.462
them for free from my basement.
- (chuckling)

16:35.495 --> 16:38.031
- The proper
ceremonial response is,

16:38.065 --> 16:39.966
"Wow, cool curtains.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.501
Are they from Etsy?"

16:41.534 --> 16:43.170
- Cool curtains.
Are they from Etsy?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.471
- Let's move on.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.340
Now, Tom, what would you do
if I put this in front of you?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.209
(dramatic music pounds)

16:49.242 --> 16:50.543
- I'd eat it.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.479
- Wrong.
- Shit. Shit.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.148
- The correct answer
is that you photograph the food

16:55.182 --> 16:56.483
and then if there's time,
you eat it,

16:56.516 --> 16:57.984
but that is by far secondary.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.019
- We have to go.
It's 9:00 p.m.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.389
- But I thought you said
we were having dinner.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.225
- 9:00 p.m. is dinner.
Shit!

17:05.258 --> 17:07.060
(dramatic musical flourish)

17:07.094 --> 17:08.995
- Get in here, you two.
- Hi!

17:09.028 --> 17:11.164
- Hello. Good to see you.
- Hey, Tom.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.833
Patti, hi, how are you?
- Oh, Lucy, hello.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.336
- Nice to see you.
I hope you guys like tofu curry.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.171
- I look forward to
taking a picture of it

17:18.205 --> 17:19.906
before I eat it.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.007
- Oh.
- Mm.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.875
- Ooh, nice curtains.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.043
Are they from Etsy?

17:24.077 --> 17:25.345
- You know what?
They are!

17:25.378 --> 17:26.846
How did you know?
Come on in, come on in.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.515
- So glad you could make it.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.582
(Walter Martin's
"We're All Young Together")

17:29.616 --> 17:31.384
- * The new kid on my street

17:31.418 --> 17:32.852
- I can't believe we've got

17:32.885 --> 17:35.021
13 members of our family
in the NYPD.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.257
- Actually, it's 12,
since Johnny got shot.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.026
*

17:40.059 --> 17:41.394
- * We like to sing

17:41.428 --> 17:43.563
* This song in harmony

17:43.596 --> 17:47.400
* And her mama sings too

17:47.434 --> 17:50.870
* And the old man
taps his shoe *

17:50.903 --> 17:54.541
* Music's like shampoo

17:54.574 --> 17:57.244
* I need it every morning

17:57.277 --> 17:59.546
* Yes, I do

17:59.579 --> 18:02.615
* And we're all young
together *
