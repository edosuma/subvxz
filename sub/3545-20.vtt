00:00.166 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously, on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.083 --> 00:04.500
- I want a child.
- We made a deal. No kids.

00:04.583 --> 00:08.250
- <i>Tampering with prescriptions...</i>
- File on Noah's daughter.

00:08.333 --> 00:09.792
<i>...uncovering evidence...</i>

00:09.875 --> 00:11.125
What are we looking for?

00:12.583 --> 00:15.667
- What was that?
<i>- ...breaking and entering...</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:19.583
- Bree is a lady.
- A very beautiful, classy lady.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.834
Remember, they tend to end up
with doctors, not pharmacists.

00:22.917 --> 00:26.333
<i>...and a whole lot of revenge.</i>

00:33.208 --> 00:35.291
<i>Since she was a little girl,</i>

00:35.375 --> 00:39.500
<i>Susan Mayer wanted to be a mother</i>
<i>in the worst way.</i>

00:39.583 --> 00:43.000
OK, I'm gonna get your bottle.
You're so cute, yeah!

00:43.083 --> 00:46.583
<i>And from the first day she brought Julie</i>
<i>home from the hospital...</i>

00:47.917 --> 00:50.000
Oh! How did you...

00:50.083 --> 00:52.166
<i>She was.</i>

00:55.709 --> 00:56.959
Oh, my gosh!

00:57.041 --> 01:00.041
<i>Despite her desire</i>
<i>to do well by her daughter...</i>

01:01.166 --> 01:04.250
<i>...Susan suffered</i>
<i>through countless failures.</i>

01:04.333 --> 01:06.000
So sorry!

01:07.583 --> 01:11.000
<i>Of course, it took Susan</i>
<i>a few years to realize</i>

01:11.083 --> 01:15.917
<i>that even the best of parents</i>
<i>make mistakes now and then.</i>

01:22.542 --> 01:25.875
<i>But now that Julie was a teenage girl,</i>

01:25.959 --> 01:29.625
<i>Susan had started to realize...</i>

01:30.625 --> 01:33.291
<i>...there was no room for error.</i>

01:35.000 --> 01:38.583
Julie, what is Zach doing out there?
I told you not to speak to him.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.208
That's why he's throwing gravel
at my window.

01:41.291 --> 01:44.875
Right, that's it.
I'm gonna handle this once and for all.

01:49.208 --> 01:52.041
Zach, what do you think you're...

02:00.000 --> 02:02.667
Mrs. Mayer, I am so sorry.

02:02.750 --> 02:06.041
One pebble wasn't working
so I tried a whole handful.

02:07.041 --> 02:08.166
I'll make it up to you.

02:08.250 --> 02:11.458
- How, will you give me your corneas?
- Mom, lay back.

02:11.542 --> 02:15.458
I wanted to talk to Julie. She hasn't
been returning my phone calls.

02:15.542 --> 02:18.834
Well, I'm here now.
What do you want?

02:18.917 --> 02:22.458
Come on, Julie.
I just wanna see you again.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.458
You know. Talk, hang out.

02:24.542 --> 02:27.834
Maybe it would be better
if we just cooled it for a while, OK?

02:27.917 --> 02:28.917
Why?

02:29.000 --> 02:33.041
You threw rocks in her mother's face.
How's that for a start?

02:42.458 --> 02:43.750
Thank you so much.

02:43.834 --> 02:48.000
I've been trying to break up with him
for weeks. Finally, an excuse.

02:48.083 --> 02:50.583
<i>Yes, Susan had failed</i>
<i>many times as a mother.</i>

02:50.667 --> 02:51.709
You did good, Mom.

02:51.792 --> 02:54.333
<i>So she took her victories</i>
<i>where she found them.</i>

02:54.417 --> 02:55.834
You're welcome.

03:39.834 --> 03:43.667
<i>Spring comes every year</i>
<i>to Wisteria Lane.</i>

03:43.750 --> 03:47.375
<i>It's the time when flowers</i>
<i>start to bloom.</i>

03:47.458 --> 03:51.417
<i>When butterflies</i>
<i>emerge from their cocoons.</i>

03:51.500 --> 03:54.792
<i>When bees begin to search for nectar.</i>

03:55.917 --> 04:00.375
<i>Spring is also the time</i>
<i>when a young man's fancy turns to...</i>

04:00.458 --> 04:01.917
<i>...obsession.</i>

04:02.000 --> 04:04.458
We must buy that.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.792
Hello, there.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.625
Oh, my heavenly days!

04:13.709 --> 04:15.417
Rex, look, it's George.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.709
Nice to see you Bree.

04:17.792 --> 04:18.792
Dr. Van De Kamp.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.375
George.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.375
So, how's your health?

04:22.458 --> 04:25.458
Not good. My cardiologist is an idiot.

04:25.542 --> 04:28.792
The doctor upped his dosage twice
and it's still not helping.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.709
I'm sure it'll all work itself out.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.875
It's funny running into you both.

04:32.959 --> 04:36.542
I have tickets to a bonsai exposition
in Mount Pleasant Friday night.

04:36.625 --> 04:39.291
- Would you like to go?
- I would love to! Rex?

04:39.375 --> 04:43.375
A whole evening of bonsai trees?
Wouldn't it be easier to shoot me?

04:43.458 --> 04:45.417
Probably.

04:53.542 --> 04:56.166
Well, why don't we
just go by ourselves, then?

04:56.250 --> 05:00.250
Actually, Bree,
we have that thing, Friday night.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.959
What? We don't have a thing.

05:02.041 --> 05:06.750
I think your husband's trying to say
he doesn't want you going out with me.

05:06.834 --> 05:08.959
Rex, are you still jealous?

05:09.542 --> 05:10.625
No.

05:10.709 --> 05:14.625
We dated during the separation
but we're just friends now, aren't we?

05:14.709 --> 05:16.417
Strictly platonic.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.083
- But if you feel threatened...
- I don't feel threatened.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.542
Good. Then it's a date.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.917
Are you going to make a purchase today?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.500
I have finally convinced Rex
to buy his first orchid.

05:32.583 --> 05:35.166
Study up. I hate people
who own precious flowers

05:35.250 --> 05:37.208
and don't know
how to take care of them.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.166
You know what I hate? Weeds.

05:39.250 --> 05:42.333
They pop up and you have
to work so hard to get rid of them.

05:42.417 --> 05:46.625
I find, with the right chemicals,
you can get rid of almost anything.

05:46.709 --> 05:49.208
- See you Friday.
- Bye.

05:53.917 --> 05:58.625
Mrs. Solis, what a surprise. We haven't
seen you in here in quite some time.

05:58.709 --> 06:03.500
My husband and I went through a down-
sizing phase but we snapped out of it.

06:03.583 --> 06:05.250
Life is good.

06:05.333 --> 06:08.166
Oh, and this would make it
so much better!

06:08.250 --> 06:09.583
Excellent.

06:09.667 --> 06:12.333
Slip inside, see how that feels.

06:12.417 --> 06:17.750
Oh! I'd love to have this
in my driveway by Saturday.

06:17.834 --> 06:21.250
I'm having a big barbecue.
I want everyone to see it.

06:21.333 --> 06:25.000
- How exciting. What's the occasion?
- My husband's going-away party.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.625
Really? Where's he going?

06:27.709 --> 06:31.375
It's a sort of
government-sponsored sabbatical.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.208
How long is he going to be gone?

06:33.291 --> 06:34.834
Eight months.

06:34.917 --> 06:37.792
Six with good behavior.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.041
- Isn't the leather interior wonderful?
- It is.

06:42.125 --> 06:45.583
It is.
It's just the smell's a little intense.

06:45.667 --> 06:50.083
It was imported from Italy.
It's 100% Italian calf.

06:57.458 --> 07:01.083
I'm so sorry!
It just hit me out of nowhere.

07:01.166 --> 07:04.667
It's so weird. Smells have been
making me nauseous lately.

07:05.875 --> 07:09.625
- Boobs tender? Achy back?
- Yeah.

07:09.709 --> 07:12.709
- Has it been going around?
- Only for centuries.

07:12.792 --> 07:16.500
I went through it carrying my eldest.
The truth is,

07:16.583 --> 07:20.166
you're never gonna fit a child
safety seat in the back of that Spyder.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.417
The four-doors are much roomier.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.375
Wait... I'm sorry, you...

07:25.458 --> 07:27.959
You think I'm pregnant?
No, I'm not pregnant.

07:28.041 --> 07:31.625
You have all the symptoms,
I just assumed.

07:31.709 --> 07:34.750
- Well, you assumed wrong.
- I'm sorry.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.208
- I'm on the pill, for God's sakes!
- OK.

07:37.291 --> 07:41.000
And I don't want a four-door.
I want a sexy little convertible.

07:41.083 --> 07:43.750
- I wanna buy one, now.
- I'll start the paperwork.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.500
Well, not this one.
I vomited in this one.

07:46.583 --> 07:49.875
Right. We'll find you a fresh one.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.291
Peterson Advertising.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.125
Lynette!

08:03.208 --> 08:07.291
- You forgot your Halpern file.
- Oh, my God. Lynette.

08:07.375 --> 08:12.000
<i>If there was one person</i>
<i>Lynette never expected to see again,</i>

08:12.083 --> 08:15.333
<i>it was Annabel Foster.</i>

08:15.417 --> 08:19.583
<i>Eight years earlier,</i>
<i>Annabel had begged Tom to marry her.</i>

08:19.667 --> 08:22.709
<i>But he told her</i>
<i>he wasn't the marrying kind.</i>

08:22.792 --> 08:25.166
<i>Then one day,</i>

08:25.250 --> 08:28.166
<i>Tom happened to meet</i>
<i>a rising young executive</i>

08:28.250 --> 08:31.125
<i>by the name of Lynette Lindquist.</i>

08:32.792 --> 08:35.792
<i>And after a few torrid weeks,</i>

08:35.875 --> 08:41.750
<i>Tom decided perhaps he was</i>
<i>the marrying kind after all,</i>

08:42.959 --> 08:47.458
<i>causing an embittered Annabel</i>
<i>to move back to Chicago.</i>

08:47.542 --> 08:48.667
<i>Permanently.</i>

08:48.750 --> 08:51.208
<i>Or so Lynette had hoped.</i>

08:51.291 --> 08:54.208
You look fantastic!

08:54.291 --> 08:57.125
Thank you! And you!

08:57.208 --> 09:02.583
You're here, in the office.
Tom's office.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.417
Going on three months now.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.333
Didn't Tom tell you?

09:08.417 --> 09:12.500
It must have slipped his mind.

09:15.458 --> 09:19.208
Afraid to tell the wife you're
working with the old girlfriend, huh?

09:19.291 --> 09:22.792
I guess that makes me
your dirty little secret!

09:26.375 --> 09:29.834
Well, I'll let you get back to work.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.750
- See you later.
- Can't wait.

09:32.834 --> 09:35.083
I almost forgot.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.041
Your file. Here.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.959
Hey, Paul. What's up?

09:47.041 --> 09:49.625
Something's been nagging me,
I want to talk to you.

09:49.709 --> 09:52.417
- OK.
- That night I found you in my house.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.750
- Why were you really there?
- You know why.

09:55.834 --> 09:59.542
- I came to drop off your key.
- Some things were moved around.

09:59.625 --> 10:03.375
- What were you looking for?
- What are you talking about?

10:03.458 --> 10:06.959
Do I have to call the police?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.625
Do whatever you want.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.625
Suit yourself.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.291
OK! Susan made me do it.

10:17.375 --> 10:20.667
She has this fixation
on why Mary Alice killed herself.

10:20.750 --> 10:24.166
Keeps blathering on about
blackmail notes and dead babies.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.500
She got really hot and bothered
when she found the name "Angela".

10:27.583 --> 10:29.917
Written on one of your video tapes?

10:30.917 --> 10:33.000
Did she find what she was looking for?

10:33.083 --> 10:36.500
No. You came home before
she had a chance to watch the video.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.125
I see.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.625
She sort of thinks you're evil.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.083
Thank you, Edie.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.625
What was that all about?

10:55.709 --> 11:00.583
Susan Mayer's obsession
with Mary Alice almost got me arrested.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.250
Now Paul's after her.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.542
If I liked her better, I'd warn but...

11:05.625 --> 11:07.041
You know.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.667
Thanks.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.583
Susan.

11:26.709 --> 11:29.625
Well... Talk to you girls later.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.208
Still avoiding me, huh?

11:32.291 --> 11:34.500
No.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.834
What do you want?

11:37.917 --> 11:41.000
I heard that you and Edie
broke into Paul Young's house.

11:41.083 --> 11:44.125
- Who told you that?
- Edie.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.917
Well... Yeah, we did.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.959
We were just looking...

11:52.041 --> 11:53.667
It doesn't matter, it was dumb.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.667
I want you to stay away from that guy.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.166
I was planning on doing that anyway.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.792
Good.

12:01.917 --> 12:03.375
Mike.

12:03.458 --> 12:07.250
I know why I was planning to stay
away from him. Why do you want me to?

12:07.333 --> 12:12.041
I just know he's a bad guy.
So please, don't mess with him.

12:12.125 --> 12:13.792
I won't.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.041
I promise.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.291
So, I've been thinking
about the pharmacist.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.083
George. What about him?

12:36.166 --> 12:38.291
I don't think you should
go out with him.

12:38.375 --> 12:42.333
Please, he's the only friend I have
who's interested in cultural things.

12:43.417 --> 12:47.834
Bree, I'm worried because
he is obviously still in love with you.

12:47.917 --> 12:51.125
No, he just wants to be friends.
He told me so.

12:51.208 --> 12:54.417
Well, what else
would a man in love say?

12:54.500 --> 12:58.375
- He's desperate to spend time with you.
- He does not seem desperate to me.

12:59.834 --> 13:03.417
I saw the way his hands trembled
when you touched his shoulder.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.583
They did?

13:06.166 --> 13:09.375
When we first started dating,
the same thing happened to me.

13:09.458 --> 13:12.041
I don't remember that.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.291
Listen, continuing to see him
would just give him false hope.

13:15.375 --> 13:18.542
Well, I certainly
don't want to hurt him.

13:18.625 --> 13:22.291
- Again.
- No, you don't.

13:22.375 --> 13:25.875
I even think it would be a good idea
to switch pharmacies.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.125
Really?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.834
Well, OK.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.709
You know what I'm gonna
miss most about him?

13:35.792 --> 13:39.000
George always has a way
of making me feel good about myself.

13:39.083 --> 13:42.083
Yeah, he's a terrific guy.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.917
Honey, do your hands still tremble
when they touch me?

13:48.709 --> 13:52.000
No. But, come on,
we've been married 18 years.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.375
Yes, we have.

13:55.458 --> 13:59.208
And you still don't know
when I need you to lie.

14:06.083 --> 14:10.000
Excuse me, this home pregnancy test,
is it a good one?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.375
I guess.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.500
OK...

14:14.583 --> 14:17.458
- Do you have a rest room?
- It's for employees only.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.667
It's right over there, Mrs. Solis.
Help yourself.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.333
Thank you.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.959
What did I tell you
about being rude to customers?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.875
Stick a smile on your face
or I'll keep you in back

14:30.959 --> 14:32.917
where no one has to look at you.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.750
Bree, what a pleasant surprise!
What brings you here?

14:38.834 --> 14:41.750
Didn't we fill Dr. Van De Kamp's
prescription last week?

14:41.834 --> 14:45.917
George, as it turns out, I won't be able
to go with you to the bonsai expo.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.542
Why not?

14:47.625 --> 14:50.834
It would be a mistake for us
to spend too much time together.

14:50.917 --> 14:54.375
Dr. Van De Kamp said something
about me. What was it?

14:54.458 --> 14:57.667
- It doesn't matter.
- Please, tell me.

14:57.750 --> 15:00.208
He said you're still in love with me.

15:02.166 --> 15:05.333
That's stupid.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.834
I'm not in love with you. I'm not.

15:08.917 --> 15:12.208
The truth is, I'm in love with Ginger.

15:12.291 --> 15:14.875
Ginger? The stock girl?

15:14.917 --> 15:17.542
Yes. It's very serious.

15:22.792 --> 15:25.250
Why didn't you tell me?!

15:25.333 --> 15:28.625
Well, we're taking it slow,
but she is definitely the one.

15:28.709 --> 15:30.917
My goodness,
this changes everything.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.375
Listen, a friend of mine
is having a barbecue on Saturday.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.041
- You should come.
- Really?

15:36.125 --> 15:37.709
Yes, and bring Ginger.

15:37.792 --> 15:41.542
Ginger? I don't know if she can make it.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.375
You have to bring Ginger because

15:43.458 --> 15:46.083
if Rex sees the two of you together,
he'll relax.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.333
- OK.
- Son of a bitch!

15:56.333 --> 15:58.917
You are out of toilet paper.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.500
Bree, I'll call you later.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.583
Lynette!

16:10.583 --> 16:12.208
Hey, honey!

16:12.291 --> 16:16.083
- Are you home?
- Three months?

16:16.166 --> 16:19.125
God, you scared the hell out of me.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.625
Were you ever gonna tell me?

16:21.709 --> 16:26.291
I wanted to, but I kept putting it off.
I knew how you'd react.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.875
Congratulations,
you read me like a book.

16:30.166 --> 16:33.458
Why would you hire that woman?

16:33.542 --> 16:36.959
Well, technically, Peterson found her.
I just vouched for her.

16:37.041 --> 16:39.583
- Tom...
- Honey, I'm just helping her out.

16:39.667 --> 16:44.000
It's the least I can do. She was
devastated when I left her for you.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.417
I felt bad.

16:46.917 --> 16:49.417
Do you still have feelings for her?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.542
All right, I'm not talking to you.

16:51.625 --> 16:55.458
You can tell me. You still care
about her, don't you? Just a teeny bit?

16:55.542 --> 16:59.291
I was just trying to be a good guy.
That's all.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.458
- You can't work with her.
- What do you want me to do? Quit?

17:02.542 --> 17:04.875
Talk to Peterson,
he can get her transferred.

17:04.959 --> 17:07.625
Weren't you guys
starting something up in Belize?

17:07.709 --> 17:11.667
- Honey, you're crazy.
- No, I'm serious.

17:11.750 --> 17:15.250
If she stays, I will haunt your office.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.291
I'll bring your lunch every day.

17:17.375 --> 17:20.750
I'll bring the kids to visit,
I will change diapers on your desk.

17:20.834 --> 17:24.333
Every birthday cake in the break room,
every retirement party,

17:24.417 --> 17:26.750
I will be there, watching her.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.583
Well, I'd better
get you a parking space,

17:30.667 --> 17:32.417
'cause she's staying.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.083
Don't you think it spices up the room?

17:54.333 --> 17:57.500
I was just leaving you a gift
to apologize for,

17:57.583 --> 18:00.083
you know,
throwing gravel in your face.

18:02.041 --> 18:05.125
- Well, you didn't have to do that.
- I kinda did.

18:05.208 --> 18:08.542
- See, I want us to be friends.
- Yeah, well...

18:09.834 --> 18:12.917
- That's not gonna happen.
- Why not?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.083
Aside from you blinding me?

18:16.166 --> 18:20.083
Several weeks ago,
you freaked out in my house.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.709
You screamed,
you threw furniture around...

18:23.959 --> 18:27.375
OK, I realize that
I was out of line that night.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.250
But I was upset.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.041
And we have to get over that,
for Julie's sake.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.750
For Julie's sake?

18:33.834 --> 18:38.458
How does it make her feel that her
mother and boyfriend can't get along?

18:38.542 --> 18:42.375
Julie does not think of you
as her boyfriend.

18:42.458 --> 18:45.542
In fact, I don't think
she wants anything to do with you.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.458
- She said that?
- Yeah.

18:49.542 --> 18:53.208
- I don't believe you.
- Believe whatever you want.

18:53.291 --> 18:56.291
It's because you tell her stuff
about me that's not true!

18:56.375 --> 18:58.917
Zach! Come here!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.166
Right now!

19:05.333 --> 19:09.375
Please. Don't ruin this for me.

19:32.208 --> 19:34.500
How do you know Mary Alice?

19:34.583 --> 19:36.583
- Who?
- Mary Alice Young.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.834
She lives next door to me in Fairview.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.000
She's here in this picture with you.

19:42.083 --> 19:46.709
That's Angela Forrest, we worked
at the rehab center 15 years ago.

19:46.792 --> 19:49.583
Don't be dense.
Don't you think I know my own neighbor?

19:53.083 --> 19:55.500
Does this Mary Alice have children?

19:55.583 --> 19:58.250
A teenager. A boy.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.500
What?

20:05.250 --> 20:08.875
Angela and I worked with
a very disturbed young woman

20:08.959 --> 20:11.583
who gave birth to a baby boy.

20:11.667 --> 20:17.041
About a year later,
Angela and her husband disappeared.

20:17.125 --> 20:21.750
Not long after that,
I heard that the child was missing too.

20:21.834 --> 20:25.041
People said it was just a coincidence.

20:25.125 --> 20:28.959
But in my heart, I always hoped
she had given him a proper home.

20:30.875 --> 20:34.500
Are you saying she stole the baby?

20:34.583 --> 20:38.500
Don't look shocked, Martha.
It makes your face look fat.

20:40.792 --> 20:44.542
The biological mother was a drug addict.

20:44.625 --> 20:48.458
If Angela really is your neighbor,
which I doubt,

20:48.542 --> 20:52.000
then that child was very lucky.

21:13.875 --> 21:17.583
Lynette, hey! If you're looking for Tom,
he's out with a client.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.917
No. I actually wanted to see you.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.250
You know, that's really funny,
I was thinking the same thing.

21:23.333 --> 21:27.083
I've been here all this time. We should
go out, for lunch, the two of us.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.125
Yeah. I'll check my book.

21:30.875 --> 21:33.542
So, Annabel...

21:33.625 --> 21:36.583
...do you have feelings for Tom?

21:36.667 --> 21:38.834
- What?
- You heard me.

21:38.917 --> 21:42.834
OK, you wanna talk about this?
Let's talk.

21:42.917 --> 21:47.458
Yes, Tom and I were in love.
But he married you.

21:47.542 --> 21:51.458
I'm not looking
to break up a happy couple.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.583
Anyway, that's rather
more your speed, isn't it?

21:55.500 --> 21:58.625
Morning, ladies.
Just coming in for a little more fuel.

21:58.709 --> 22:02.375
Yup. One man's sludge
is another man's liquid gold.

22:03.750 --> 22:07.375
Well, back to the trenches.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.583
Watch your step. Tom and I are a team.

22:11.667 --> 22:15.625
Our marriage is rock solid.
Nothing you do could ever break that up.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.625
Then why are you down here right now,
warning me?

22:32.333 --> 22:35.166
Gabrielle! What brings you down here?

22:37.250 --> 22:40.667
Oh, sweet Mother of God,
what have you done this time?

22:40.750 --> 22:43.583
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.750
And it's impossible, I'm on the pill.

22:45.834 --> 22:48.333
Which you probably think is a sin,
but it works.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.792
It's a 99.9% effective sin.

22:50.875 --> 22:54.375
Maybe it's in that one tenth
of a percent that God resides.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.917
Couldn't wait to throw that in,
could you?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.500
God is screwing with me.

22:58.583 --> 23:01.542
He doesn't like the way
I live my life so he's punishing me.

23:01.625 --> 23:05.333
Have you done something
that would warrant being punished?

23:06.291 --> 23:07.917
The gardener?

23:09.417 --> 23:12.917
- I thought that was over.
- No, it was, and then...

23:13.000 --> 23:14.542
You just had to be there.

23:14.625 --> 23:19.667
My point is, I'd be an awful mother.
I'm selfish and self-centered...

23:19.750 --> 23:22.125
The only person
more self-centered is Carlos.

23:22.208 --> 23:25.458
He's so self-centered, he doesn't
know how self-centered I am.

23:25.542 --> 23:26.917
We'd be terrible parents.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.375
Gabrielle, I'd like to help,
but I'm not sure what it is you want.

23:30.458 --> 23:33.917
It's just, I wanna know
who to be angry at.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.792
Here's a thought: don't be angry.

23:36.875 --> 23:40.208
Be thankful.
Children are a gift, are they not?

23:42.834 --> 23:47.375
I don't have time for this crap.
I have a party to plan.

23:48.417 --> 23:49.709
Thanks.

23:51.458 --> 23:55.959
- Things are really coming along.
- Yeah. Slowly and expensively.

23:56.041 --> 23:59.834
It'll be worth it.
You're doing an amazing job.

24:00.875 --> 24:05.291
So look, you're basically a predator,
and I need some advice.

24:07.834 --> 24:11.750
I know Tom loves me,
but I don't trust this woman.

24:11.834 --> 24:14.542
I think there's an agenda there.

24:14.625 --> 24:17.166
I don't know.
Maybe I'm being paranoid.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.500
No. You did the right thing
coming to me.

24:20.583 --> 24:23.166
There are two ways to approach this.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.667
First, what kind of shape
is this woman in?

24:25.750 --> 24:28.291
Fantastic shape, she's gorgeous.

24:28.375 --> 24:32.125
OK. Now there's really only
one way to approach this.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.875
- You're gonna have to act fast.
- I'm listening.

24:34.959 --> 24:36.333
It's pretty simple.

24:36.417 --> 24:39.417
When I feel threatened by a woman,
I pull her in.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.250
I make her my best friend.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.667
You said you didn't have
any female friends.

24:43.750 --> 24:47.792
I don't. And I've never felt threatened
by another woman either.

24:47.875 --> 24:50.333
But the point is...

24:50.417 --> 24:54.041
- Keep your friends close...
- Keep your enemies closer.

25:00.750 --> 25:05.542
Tom. We're having a dinner party.
I'm thinking of inviting Annabel.

25:09.250 --> 25:12.375
- We're not moving.
- Susan knows something. Edie said...

25:12.458 --> 25:15.208
I don't care what Edie said!
I'm not leaving Julie!

25:15.291 --> 25:19.166
You wanna risk our lives, our future,
over some schoolyard crush?

25:19.250 --> 25:21.417
It's more than that. Julie loves me.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.291
Then why does she refuse to see you?

25:25.125 --> 25:28.542
Mrs. Mayer lies to her. If it wasn't
for that, she would be with me.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.542
Are you sure?

25:30.625 --> 25:34.000
- Julie's a very special girl.
- I know.

25:34.083 --> 25:37.583
She could have
just about any boy she wanted.

25:38.583 --> 25:42.000
I think you're a wonderful kid.
I do, but...

25:43.000 --> 25:45.291
You're not that special, Zach.

25:46.291 --> 25:48.417
Not really.

25:49.166 --> 25:52.792
- She kissed me.
- Lately?

25:54.959 --> 25:57.083
Let's pack our bags and get out of here.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.792
Leave this whole mess behind
and start over.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.709
And there will be other girls,
I promise.

26:02.792 --> 26:04.083
No!

26:04.166 --> 26:06.250
If Susan goes to the police, it's over.

26:06.333 --> 26:09.166
They'll take me away.
Take you away. Don't you get that?

26:09.250 --> 26:12.667
If Julie doesn't love me anymore,
it doesn't matter.

26:12.750 --> 26:15.041
None of it matters.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.667
McGruder had absolutely
no idea what was going on.

26:26.750 --> 26:30.834
During the entire shoot, he was
practically holding Benson's hand!

26:30.917 --> 26:34.458
After the way Burnham screwed him over,
I'd be nervous too!

26:34.542 --> 26:37.166
My God, it was awful!

26:39.792 --> 26:42.750
Excuse me, I need to get in here
so I can clear the plates.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.792
- You want some help?
- I'm good.

26:45.667 --> 26:47.417
Looks like we got company.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.417
Hey, guys. Isn't it time for bed?

26:49.500 --> 26:53.208
They never get to see you.
Let 'em stay up for a while.

26:53.291 --> 26:55.625
OK, come here.
I want you to meet someone.

26:57.875 --> 27:00.625
This is Miss Foster.

27:00.709 --> 27:03.500
She's an old, old friend
of your Daddy's.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.333
- What you got there?
- A picture we painted.

27:08.417 --> 27:10.458
Let me have a look at that.

27:10.542 --> 27:14.500
It's all of us with Mommy
and Daddy. We're really happy.

27:14.583 --> 27:16.875
That is so adorable.

27:16.959 --> 27:19.458
- When did you do this?
- Today. Mom told us to.

27:20.792 --> 27:23.917
I told them to paint something nice.
The sentiment's theirs.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.959
- But you told us to.
- Hold on, grown-ups are talking.

27:27.041 --> 27:29.959
Well, this is really neat.

27:30.041 --> 27:33.625
Hey, how would you boys
like to paint my portrait one day?

27:33.709 --> 27:35.041
Sure, you're pretty.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.583
OK, great. So like your dad said,
it's time for bed.

27:38.667 --> 27:41.166
I'll take 'em back upstairs.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.333
Come on, guys.

27:43.417 --> 27:44.667
Thank you.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.667
Here we go.

27:51.291 --> 27:54.000
I must say,
your home is warm and inviting,

27:54.083 --> 27:56.875
your children
are absolutely precious.

27:56.959 --> 28:00.709
This whole evening was practically
a commercial for the perfect family.

28:00.792 --> 28:03.125
You think?

28:03.208 --> 28:05.834
You couldn't have planned it any better.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.000
And I mean that.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.750
Good.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.291
Hello, Susan.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.542
Paul...

28:20.625 --> 28:21.625
Hi.

28:21.709 --> 28:25.709
I understand you and Edie
went snooping through my house.

28:26.709 --> 28:29.041
It's OK, I'm not mad.

28:29.125 --> 28:32.625
So, what do you want to know
about Angela?

28:35.667 --> 28:40.000
It was Mary Alice's birth name.
She was named after her aunt Angela.

28:40.083 --> 28:44.333
When she was a teenager, they fell out
so she changed her name to Mary Alice.

28:44.417 --> 28:48.125
This was before we were married, so
forgive me if I'm hazy on the details.

28:49.417 --> 28:52.041
That's it? That's the explanation?

28:52.125 --> 28:54.625
Ridiculously simple, isn't it?

28:56.375 --> 29:00.917
She changed her name because
she got in a fight with her aunt?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.834
That doesn't seem like
something Mary Alice would do.

29:03.917 --> 29:07.083
Neither did suicide,
but we both know she did it.

29:09.291 --> 29:13.125
So, can we finally put this behind us?

29:13.208 --> 29:16.667
Or do you need to break into my home
for anything else?

29:19.917 --> 29:21.750
No.

29:22.834 --> 29:24.375
I'm good, thanks.

29:27.625 --> 29:32.375
Though, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to see that videotape I found.

29:32.458 --> 29:34.542
The one marked "Angela".

29:34.625 --> 29:39.291
It would be nice
to see Mary Alice when she was young.

29:39.375 --> 29:42.375
I'm afraid that box of tapes
was thrown out with the trash.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.291
OK, then.

29:47.375 --> 29:53.041
Susan, I'm serious when I say I hope
you'll leave my family alone now.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.542
This endless suspicion of yours
has become very tiring.

29:57.959 --> 30:00.333
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.041
That's my cell. Sorry.

30:21.375 --> 30:24.417
My God, it's Peterson. Excuse me.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.458
- Peterson?
- Hello?

30:31.208 --> 30:34.000
So, that was quite a show
you put on tonight.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.291
Show?

30:36.375 --> 30:40.166
The boys paintings, all these references
to how happy we are?

30:40.250 --> 30:43.375
Why not subtly remind Annabel
you're happily married?

30:43.458 --> 30:45.750
It wasn't subtle.

30:45.834 --> 30:48.375
And it's an insult to me.

30:49.750 --> 30:52.291
I did not mean it that way.

30:54.917 --> 30:57.834
Are you so insecure
that you have to pull that crap?

30:57.917 --> 30:59.625
Keep your voice down!

31:00.792 --> 31:04.750
It doesn't matter if she has feelings
for me as long as I'm not interested.

31:04.834 --> 31:07.500
Have I ever, ever given you
any reason to doubt me?

31:07.583 --> 31:10.083
Anyone is capable of anything.

31:10.166 --> 31:12.375
The first time we met,
you were cheating.

31:12.458 --> 31:14.667
With you! Cheating with you!

31:14.750 --> 31:16.375
It's a pattern of behavior.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.750
Give me a break!

31:17.834 --> 31:19.875
Well, what am I supposed to do?

31:19.959 --> 31:23.667
You hire your old girlfriend and don't
tell me about it for three months?

31:23.750 --> 31:26.834
If I'd told you on day one,
you'd still jump down my throat.

31:26.917 --> 31:30.000
- Annabel is ancient history.
- She's in the next room.

31:30.083 --> 31:33.834
How long do we have to be married,
how long until you trust me?

31:33.917 --> 31:35.709
I trust you.

31:35.792 --> 31:39.542
How many times have you said, "Touch
another woman and I'll take the boys

31:39.625 --> 31:41.208
and you'll never see us again"?

31:41.291 --> 31:44.709
That's just something
wives say to their husbands.

31:44.792 --> 31:46.417
Not all wives.

31:46.500 --> 31:50.709
God, Lynette, you're just so convinced
that I'm gonna be unfaithful!

31:50.792 --> 31:53.709
It makes me sick,
the distrust, the paranoia...

31:53.792 --> 31:55.750
You know, it seems
you won't be happy

31:55.834 --> 31:59.834
until you drive me out
to prove yourself right!

32:02.458 --> 32:05.208
OK, wait. Forget I said that.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.291
It's too late.

32:07.375 --> 32:09.667
You said it.

32:09.750 --> 32:13.542
Then just consider it something
that husbands say to their wives.

32:15.625 --> 32:18.125
Well, Peterson's on cloud nine.

32:18.208 --> 32:21.417
He discovered some inside scoop
on the Metro account.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.709
The bad news is, we have
to re-do the entire presentation.

32:24.792 --> 32:27.250
- Tonight?
- They need it first thing.

32:27.333 --> 32:30.291
Peterson says
we might be pulling an all-nighter.

32:30.375 --> 32:32.500
I can't drive, I've been drinking.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.917
I'll drive. Come on.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.041
- Thanks.
- Don't worry, Lynette.

32:37.166 --> 32:39.583
I'll deliver him back to you
as soon as I can.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.417
Please do!

32:57.750 --> 33:00.959
Honey, take over a minute.
I'm giving a speech.

33:01.041 --> 33:03.625
Make sure they stay
pink like that, OK?

33:04.542 --> 33:06.291
Are you OK?

33:07.583 --> 33:11.667
Yeah, I just didn't realize
how disgusting meat could be.

33:14.542 --> 33:18.667
Everyone, I just wanted to say it means
a lot to me that all of you came.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.542
And as you know, in a few days,

33:20.625 --> 33:23.458
I'm taking a little
government-sponsored vacation.

33:23.542 --> 33:26.625
Lucky for me, breakfast is included.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.959
- Oh, God
- The bottom line is,

33:32.041 --> 33:36.041
I'm going to jail,
and when a man goes away to jail,

33:36.125 --> 33:38.792
which I hope none of you
here ever have to do,

33:38.875 --> 33:40.875
he sees who his real friends are.

33:40.959 --> 33:42.875
So thanks.

33:42.959 --> 33:45.583
Hear, hear!

33:53.417 --> 33:55.709
Excuse you.

33:58.291 --> 34:00.125
Stay put until I need you.

34:00.208 --> 34:03.834
Don't talk to anybody
and for God's sake, don't get drunk.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.041
I'm supposed to be
at my cousin's wedding.

34:06.125 --> 34:09.709
It's not a wedding, it's a commitment
ceremony. Now sit down and...

34:09.792 --> 34:11.917
...try to fit in.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.250
I got you a hotdog.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.709
No, thanks, I'm full.

34:35.792 --> 34:39.041
They have a croquet set.
Wanna go hit some balls?

34:39.125 --> 34:41.959
- No.
- That's fine. I can just sit here.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.291
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
or hang out.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.417
I want you to leave me alone, OK?

34:51.750 --> 34:53.333
OK.

35:34.041 --> 35:35.333
<i>In that moment,</i>

35:35.417 --> 35:39.375
<i>while looking at the pills that</i>
<i>had been so obviously tampered with,</i>

35:39.458 --> 35:44.583
<i>Gabrielle's nausea was suddenly</i>
<i>replaced by an even stronger sensation.</i>

35:44.667 --> 35:46.458
<i>Rage.</i>

36:03.917 --> 36:05.834
What are you doing?

36:05.917 --> 36:08.125
I'm so sorry. That was an accident.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.709
Answer my question.
What are you doing here?

36:10.792 --> 36:13.125
- I was invited.
- By who?

36:13.208 --> 36:16.333
You know what?
I don't believe I have to answer to you.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.709
- I think you do.
- What's going on here?

36:18.792 --> 36:22.709
He crashed the party. This guy
clearly is not taking no for an answer.

36:22.792 --> 36:27.000
It's OK. George has a girlfriend.
You brought her, didn't you?

36:27.083 --> 36:29.333
- He doesn't have a girlfriend.
- I do so.

36:29.417 --> 36:31.083
She's right over there.

36:35.291 --> 36:38.458
- That's his girlfriend?
- See? We were worried for nothing.

36:39.917 --> 36:43.250
So, any time you want to apologize...

36:44.667 --> 36:48.250
Come on, Rex.
You owe George some sort of gesture.

36:54.875 --> 36:56.458
What the hell.

37:06.041 --> 37:08.500
Rex, have you lost your mind?!

37:08.583 --> 37:10.625
To be fair, I only pushed him.

37:12.375 --> 37:14.250
Carlos! You son of a bitch!

37:14.333 --> 37:17.041
I am pregnant and it's all your fault.

37:26.166 --> 37:28.625
This is turning into
one hell of a party.

37:35.375 --> 37:37.792
Are you OK?

37:37.875 --> 37:40.583
I think I can honestly say, no, I'm not.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.625
I'm so sorry.

37:43.667 --> 37:44.750
Thanks.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
But you know what they say about kids?

37:49.083 --> 37:51.917
That you can't imagine
having them until you do,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.125
and then you can't imagine
life without them?

37:55.208 --> 37:56.625
It's true.

38:00.583 --> 38:04.291
All I'm saying is,
maybe this is a blessing in disguise.

38:05.458 --> 38:07.291
I don't know who the father is.

38:07.375 --> 38:08.709
What?

38:08.792 --> 38:10.041
Yeah.

38:11.041 --> 38:13.625
- So you and John have still been...?
- Yeah.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.333
I know, Susan,
I don't know what I'm gonna do!

38:18.709 --> 38:20.458
Oh, my God!

38:20.542 --> 38:23.041
- Oh, my God! That's my house!
- I'll call 911!

38:23.125 --> 38:25.000
Yes, that's my house!

38:29.625 --> 38:31.291
Look, my kitchen!

38:31.375 --> 38:33.750
It's a big fire!

38:36.583 --> 38:40.375
Turns out, someone left the gas on
with candles burning.

38:40.458 --> 38:44.709
That's not possible.
We don't burn candles during the day.

38:45.208 --> 38:50.166
Well, I did have a French
vanilla candle burning earlier, but...

38:50.250 --> 38:52.500
I'm almost positive I blew it out.

38:52.583 --> 38:54.333
You're almost positive?

38:56.750 --> 38:58.291
Yes! I did!

38:58.375 --> 39:00.375
I did, I think.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.333
The fire was contained.

39:02.417 --> 39:05.917
The damage could have been
far more extensive.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.917
You've gotta be
more careful from now on.

39:15.208 --> 39:18.250
Don't worry. We will be.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.792
Bree, hi.

39:26.875 --> 39:29.000
You left the party so quickly,

39:29.083 --> 39:32.667
I didn't have a chance to apologize
to you for what Rex did.

39:32.750 --> 39:38.375
George, I'm so sorry he humiliated you
in front of all those people.

39:38.458 --> 39:42.000
- I don't know what got into him.
- Isn't it obvious? He hates me.

39:42.083 --> 39:45.041
No, he doesn't hate you,
he doesn't even know you.

39:45.125 --> 39:48.500
- You don't really even know him.
- I know this much.

39:48.583 --> 39:51.125
He's not gonna let us be friends.

39:51.208 --> 39:53.959
Well, that's not his choice to make.

39:55.625 --> 39:58.041
What if he asks you
not to see me any more?

39:59.041 --> 40:01.667
What if he orders you not to?

40:01.750 --> 40:04.792
Well, I decide who I need in my life,

40:04.875 --> 40:07.000
and I've decided that I need you.

40:07.083 --> 40:09.542
And that's all there is to it.

40:09.625 --> 40:12.917
He could make it awfully difficult
for you to spend time with me.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.667
Well, who says he has to know
how I spend my free time?

40:30.500 --> 40:34.041
<i>I'm having trouble</i>
<i>with the family across the street.</i>

40:34.125 --> 40:37.083
<i>I think one of them</i>
<i>may have set a fire in my house.</i>

40:37.750 --> 40:39.583
<i>And I don't know why,</i>

40:39.667 --> 40:43.917
<i>but I feel like it's got something</i>
<i>to do with my friend who killed herself.</i>

40:47.041 --> 40:50.458
<i>I called the police,</i>
<i>but they didn't take me seriously.</i>

40:52.166 --> 40:56.250
This family's got a secret,
a bad secret.

40:56.333 --> 40:57.792
I'm in over my head.

40:57.875 --> 41:00.625
I need you to find out
everything there is to know

41:00.709 --> 41:03.667
about Paul Young and his family.

41:04.875 --> 41:06.625
Do you think you can help me?

41:08.458 --> 41:11.000
As a matter of fact,

41:11.083 --> 41:13.083
I know I can.

41:18.208 --> 41:22.375
<i>Spring comes every year</i>
<i>to Wisteria Lane.</i>

41:22.458 --> 41:26.625
<i>But not everyone remembers</i>
<i>to stop and smell the flowers.</i>

41:28.083 --> 41:32.834
<i>Some are too busy</i>
<i>worrying about the future.</i>

41:32.917 --> 41:37.417
<i>Or mistakes they've made in the past.</i>

41:40.000 --> 41:44.750
<i>Others are preoccupied</i>
<i>with not getting caught.</i>

41:46.500 --> 41:48.333
It's a window!

41:48.417 --> 41:53.041
<i>Or thinking of ways</i>
<i>to catch someone else.</i>

41:58.041 --> 42:01.583
<i>Still, there will always be a few</i>

42:01.667 --> 42:07.417
<i>who remember to take a moment and</i>
<i>appreciate what spring has given them.</i>

42:09.875 --> 42:15.583
<i>Just as there will always be those</i>
<i>who prefer to sit in the dark,</i>

42:15.667 --> 42:20.041
<i>brooding over everything they've lost.</i>
