00:04.705 --> 00:10.142
(western guitar music)
(hooves clopping)

00:15.416 --> 00:18.417
(eagle screeching)

01:53.414 --> 01:55.848
(gun blasting)

02:00.454 --> 02:02.187
- Everyone show me your hands.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.009
Show me your hands.

02:07.010 --> 02:08.260
Alright, everyone
needs to get out.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.194
Get out!

02:09.864 --> 02:13.232
(soft soothing music)

02:23.577 --> 02:24.643
- Put your hands up.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.182
- Hey, pretty lady.
- Hey, that's my wife.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.450
Get your hands off of her.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.618
(gun blasting)

02:32.619 --> 02:33.785
- [Billy] She was
your wife. (chuckles)

02:33.787 --> 02:34.853
I bet she'll learn next time.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.488
- I'm not armed.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.223
- I could see that.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.661
Like a game of Chance, mister?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.696
- Yes, I would.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.831
Smith's the name.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.733
Benjamin J. Smith.
- The money bag.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.768
Pick one.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.212
You lose.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.514
- What are we playing for?

03:09.890 --> 03:13.325
(western guitar music)

03:33.814 --> 03:34.947
- [John] It was just my luck

03:34.949 --> 03:36.248
to get caught in
this spring storm.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.688
I was headed to the
Arizona territory.

03:44.925 --> 03:49.628
I've been sent there to
track a bad bunch of outlaws.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.364
(horse snorting)

04:07.982 --> 04:10.800
They were easy to follow

04:10.801 --> 04:13.619
'cause they didn't try
to hide their trail.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.022
Wherever they went,
there were dead people.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.292
They showed no mercy.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.362
They had no soul.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.333
(soothing tribal music)

04:29.436 --> 04:32.304
- [Binschii] That night, I
dreamt of my grandfather.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.874
I miss him so much
and my father, too.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.021
Now I was all alone.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.432
I walk in the direction
of my people, the Navajo.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.971
We have been traveling
far from our land.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.447
(birds chirping)

05:27.728 --> 05:29.995
We would walk all
night and rest all day.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.001
- We denounce themselves.
- It would be my last time

05:36.003 --> 05:38.103
I would hear my
grandpa's favorite story.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.872
- Threw red sand
all over themselves.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.742
They didn't even talk
or see or listen.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.912
Just kept throwin' red sand
all over, stirring up the dust.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.015
This was the place called
(speaks foreign language),

05:51.485 --> 05:53.685
the home of the bitter winds.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.456
The winds that blow for no
reason, but to cause strife.

05:58.759 --> 06:02.127
The winds that come
to you carry sand.

06:02.129 --> 06:06.064
If you are caught in it,
it will sting your face.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.834
(dog panting)

06:09.703 --> 06:11.370
- [Binschii] Just like
my grandpa's story,

06:11.372 --> 06:13.472
a bitter wind was
headed our way;

06:17.378 --> 06:19.478
a wind that would
forever change my life.

06:20.781 --> 06:24.850
(intense foreboding dark music)

06:47.474 --> 06:49.941
Never again would I
feel my father's touch.

06:49.943 --> 06:55.013
(gun blasting)
(bullet pinging)

06:56.016 --> 06:58.817
(gun blasting)

07:07.861 --> 07:09.127
And my dog, my best friend,

07:09.129 --> 07:11.430
would give his life
tryin' to protect us.

07:13.033 --> 07:18.103
(gun blasting)
(dog wincing)

07:19.139 --> 07:22.941
He sent fear all over my
body as he looked my way.

07:24.845 --> 07:28.113
(soothing tribal music)

07:29.850 --> 07:32.784
(hooves clopping)

07:50.137 --> 07:55.207
(crow cawing)
(soft somber music)

07:57.911 --> 07:59.911
- [John] I was
getting closer now.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.813
The trail was not as cold.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.961
(flies buzzing)

08:19.500 --> 08:20.516
These were killers;

08:20.517 --> 08:21.533
the kind that killed
'cause they liked it.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.180
I had been a lawman
for a long time.

08:36.216 --> 08:40.085
As I saw it, life was a
battle of good against evil.

08:41.188 --> 08:46.591
Evil would never win, but it
would also never be defeated.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.995
It always seemed
to rise up again.

08:55.702 --> 09:00.739
(flies buzzing)
(soft somber music)

09:05.846 --> 09:10.916
In this life, you're either
good or you are evil.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.690
(knife scraping)

09:28.936 --> 09:32.704
¶ Swing low sweet chariot ¶

09:33.707 --> 09:36.308
(birds cooing)

09:49.256 --> 09:52.991
¶ Coming forth carry me home ¶

09:55.262 --> 09:58.830
- Chacon, how long are
we gonna be sittin' here?

09:58.832 --> 10:02.267
(Chacon laughing)

10:02.269 --> 10:05.637
(Culpepper chuckling)

10:08.909 --> 10:11.876
(hooves clopping)

10:26.293 --> 10:28.293
How come I gotta sit in the sun?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.895
- 'Cause I said so. (chuckles)

10:40.841 --> 10:41.906
- Somebody's comin'.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.287
(rifle blasting)

10:56.289 --> 10:57.656
- I got him, I got him.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.695
(gravel crunching)

11:09.002 --> 11:11.302
- Hey, he's alive!
- You just grazed him.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.103
- He's the law.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.043
(hand smacking)

11:18.045 --> 11:20.745
- US Marshall, why
you following me?

11:20.747 --> 11:22.681
- I'm not followin' you.

11:23.717 --> 11:24.683
- Why you here?

11:24.685 --> 11:27.686
- I'm just passin'
through the territory.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.821
- Why'd you hit me, Chacon?

11:29.823 --> 11:31.856
- 'Cause you never listen.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.892
I say when we shoot.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.727
Me, not you.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.766
Where you comin' from?

11:41.768 --> 11:43.435
- Colorado.

11:43.437 --> 11:44.736
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.837
I like that.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.005
Why you following me?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.741
- Like I said, I'm
not followin' you.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.776
- What are you doin' here?

11:51.778 --> 11:53.878
- I'm headed this
way to see a woman.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.181
- (laughs) A woman?!

11:56.183 --> 11:57.749
I see.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.384
Let's get him back on his horse.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.151
Get him up.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.357
(soft soothing music)

12:06.359 --> 12:09.761
- I was scared
sittin' on my horse

12:09.763 --> 12:11.162
with a noose around my neck.

12:13.467 --> 12:17.469
Lord, it ain't fair
to go this way.

12:17.471 --> 12:18.403
It just ain't.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.774
I never thought it
would end like this,

12:22.776 --> 12:25.043
a horse with a noose on
my neck like an outlaw.

12:28.815 --> 12:32.150
Lord, I wouldn't mind you
gettin' me outta this one.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.153
I know I haven't exactly.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.888
Easy now, Chance.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.123
Easy, easy boy; it's okay.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.158
You hold there, Chance.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.894
Good boy, now you hold.

12:44.498 --> 12:45.764
Son of a bitch.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.535
I thought it would
end like this.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.503
I swear to God.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.844
Lord, it's a
beautiful goddamn day.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.914
(somber piano music)

13:07.854 --> 13:09.187
- [Binschii] SI wandered always

13:09.189 --> 13:10.922
in the direction of my people.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.266
I had never known such sorrow.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.268
I was barren.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.944
- I prayed and I
thought about my life.

13:36.283 --> 13:39.284
Lord in Heaven
hallowed be thy name.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.220
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

13:43.290 --> 13:45.924
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

13:46.593 --> 13:50.094
(tranquil tribal music)

14:13.253 --> 14:17.121
All night I stayed
awake to urge my horse

14:17.123 --> 14:18.623
to stand where he was.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.125
Maggie, I don't see ya.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.930
I was comin', darlin'.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.065
I was comin'.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.902
(wolves howling)

14:33.640 --> 14:38.910
Oh god, help me.

14:40.013 --> 14:45.083
(crickets chirping)
(wolves howling)

14:50.991 --> 14:54.192
- [Binschii] I dreamed
of my sheep in my home.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.362
My mother came into my
dreams and brushed my hair.

14:58.932 --> 15:03.935
(crickets chirping)
(wolves howling)

15:06.106 --> 15:08.940
(dog growling)
(soft intriguing music)

15:08.942 --> 15:11.643
In the morning, I woke
to a giant wolf dog

15:11.645 --> 15:13.144
staring down at me.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.947
(dog growling)

15:23.123 --> 15:25.156
So I ran and it followed.

15:25.158 --> 15:29.060
(energetic orchestral music)

15:32.098 --> 15:34.632
(dog barking)

15:44.678 --> 15:48.046
I had the knife my father
gave me and I used it.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.983
(dog growling)

16:22.215 --> 16:25.016
(dog growling)

17:00.487 --> 17:03.254
I had never seen such a sight.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.424
A white man on a horse with
a rope around his neck.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.694
- I been prayin' all day
for an angel and a miracle

17:09.696 --> 17:11.496
and I think you're it.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.797
- [Binschii] I wanted to run,

17:12.799 --> 17:15.166
but just then the
wolf dog appeared.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.073
(noose creaking)

17:29.449 --> 17:32.316
(John thudding)

17:34.721 --> 17:37.722
- All I remember is wakin'
up and seeing the boy,

17:38.691 --> 17:40.358
the boy who saved my life.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.193
You did it.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.294
I was elated.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.529
I have a second chance.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.463
You did it.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.466
- [Binschii] I had never been

17:48.468 --> 17:51.135
this close to a
white man before.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.170
I feared them.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.207
We all did for what
they did to my people.

17:57.544 --> 17:58.810
(John laughing)

17:58.812 --> 18:00.711
I had no idea what
he was saying,

18:00.713 --> 18:02.346
but I listened to his voice

18:02.348 --> 18:05.149
and I could tell
he was a good man.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.552
- You just made the best
friend of your life.

18:11.224 --> 18:14.125
(birds chirping)

18:42.522 --> 18:43.488
Son,

18:46.159 --> 18:49.127
I wanna thank you for my life.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.431
I prayed for someone to come
and save me and you did.

18:56.870 --> 18:59.370
Those sons of bitches
wanna hang me.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.175
You got kin around here?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.243
You got family?

19:07.881 --> 19:08.813
Wouldn't it be
something if they come

19:08.815 --> 19:11.449
and get me now? (chuckles)

19:11.451 --> 19:16.420
Oh my god, thank you
Lord and thank you, son.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.855
My name is John Towne.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.824
I'm the US Marshall.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.527
I'm gonna get my stuff, alright?

19:34.908 --> 19:40.178
(birds chirping)
(wind whooshing)

19:40.847 --> 19:44.582
(dog panting and growling)

19:44.584 --> 19:47.385
(John wincing)

20:01.668 --> 20:02.934
Son of a bitch.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.403
Rain on me, why don't ya?

20:15.448 --> 20:20.518
(river trickling)
(birds chirping)

20:46.379 --> 20:49.247
(John chuckling)

21:14.941 --> 21:15.940
- [Santiago] Guns.

21:15.942 --> 21:20.511
Victorio will trade
him only for guns.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.414
- Can I see them?

21:25.351 --> 21:27.318
- [John] I didn't
know it at the time,

21:27.320 --> 21:28.419
but Chacon and his gang

21:28.421 --> 21:29.987
were sellin' rifles
to the Apaches.

21:31.691 --> 21:35.426
They were tradin' Spanish
gold and gems for guns.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.697
(soft soothing music)

21:49.976 --> 21:50.741
- Beautiful.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.581
- Rifle.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.617
- Man need rifles.

22:01.788 --> 22:05.089
We will send some warrior
to show you the way

22:05.091 --> 22:06.424
to our summer camp.

22:10.797 --> 22:11.729
- Okay.

22:22.475 --> 22:27.545
(hooves clopping)
(crow cawing)

22:48.835 --> 22:51.736
- It was clear that the boy
wanted to show me somethin'.

22:54.574 --> 22:59.643
(soft piano music)
(birds chirping)

23:02.115 --> 23:04.048
Now I knew why he was all alone.

23:13.626 --> 23:17.395
Son, sometimes life ain't fair.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.665
For you, today's
one of them days.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.101
I'm truly sorry.

23:45.491 --> 23:50.561
(fire crackling)
(frogs croaking)

23:59.705 --> 24:03.707
This boy had saved my life and
I was gonna do right by him.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.788
Sleep well, son.

24:51.891 --> 24:52.957
You had a rough day.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.881
(horse snorting)

25:17.984 --> 25:20.985
I followed Chacon's trail
to a little trading post.

25:20.987 --> 25:26.190
(soft guitar strumming)
(muffled singing)

25:28.861 --> 25:32.730
- Welcome to the
Imperial Trading Post.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.665
What can we do for ya?

25:34.667 --> 25:38.569
- I need some guns.
- Rifles or pistols?

25:38.571 --> 25:39.537
- Both.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.744
- Don't mind me askin',

25:46.745 --> 25:48.612
what are you doin' travellin'
with this Indian boy?

25:48.614 --> 25:50.014
- [Binschii] These
white men were different

25:50.016 --> 25:51.815
and I could feel their evil.

25:54.754 --> 25:58.889
- Kinda strange travelin'
with that Indian boy.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.958
- [Binschii] Especially
the one with no hair

26:00.960 --> 26:02.593
on top of his head.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.227
- [John] Lemme see that
pistol right there.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.696
- That one's not for sale.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.699
- Gimme that rifle then.

26:14.307 --> 26:15.839
- That's a good rifle.

26:15.841 --> 26:16.807
(rifle cocking)

26:16.809 --> 26:19.209
You wanna sell him or trade him?

26:19.211 --> 26:22.947
I got blankets,
whiskey and guns.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.649
I even got Irene.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.318
Might even wanna poke with her.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.719
Irene!

26:29.722 --> 26:30.688
- Cartridges.

26:30.690 --> 26:35.726
- (chuckles) She gets a little
feisty every once in a while.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.995
I got her about a week
ago from the Mexies.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.734
- Now you gimme that pistol.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.270
- I told you, that
wasn't for sale.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.640
- Pick it up and
look at the grips.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.942
On the bottom,
there's some initials.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.813
JT, stands for John Towne.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.081
Marshall John Towne.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.853
- Well I'll be.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.656
- Thought they hung him.

27:05.658 --> 27:06.624
- Appears not.

27:08.027 --> 27:08.993
- Smart man.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.996
Take my badge off your shirt.

27:24.844 --> 27:29.913
- Now we have nothin' to do
with this as you know, Marshall.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.316
- I'm sure y'all broken
up about it, ain't ya?

27:34.020 --> 27:35.719
Now y'all listen to me.

27:35.721 --> 27:38.322
I got business with
Chacon and his men.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.691
I will require you
to watch this boy.

27:41.394 --> 27:43.794
- What do you mean
by watch the boy?

27:45.131 --> 27:46.730
- No harm will come to him

27:46.732 --> 27:48.666
and he will be
here when I return.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.903
- I think we can arrange that.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.945
- [John] I'll be
back for you soon.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.816
I'll get ya; I'll
be back for you.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.722
No no, go back; sit.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.058
I'll be back for ya, alright?

28:17.830 --> 28:19.763
- 'Pears you don't wanna go.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.832
Want me to tie him
to a chair, Marshall?

28:22.735 --> 28:25.469
(men laughing)

28:25.471 --> 28:27.971
- [Binschii] When he left
me, my hopes were dashed.

28:27.973 --> 28:28.972
I was forlorn.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.176
- [John] I felt bad
about leavin' him.

28:32.178 --> 28:35.913
But by god, no one was gonna
put a noose around my neck

28:35.915 --> 28:37.715
and not hear about it from me.

28:39.785 --> 28:44.855
(river trickling)
(birds chirping)

28:52.198 --> 28:54.465
- Get up, we gotta
go get these rifles.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.100
- I'm tired, I'll catch up.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.501
Go ahead.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.470
- Chacon ain't gon' like this.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.071
- Chacon ain't here, is he?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.473
- No, he's not.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.007
- Okay, we got time.

29:04.009 --> 29:05.042
Go ahead.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.744
- Alright, suit yourself.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.952
- Culpepper get your
boot off me, man.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.989
- Next time you hang a man,
you better do it right.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.158
(gun thudding)

29:21.160 --> 29:22.993
(river whooshing)

29:22.995 --> 29:24.495
- Hey man, what're you doin'?

29:24.497 --> 29:25.429
- Where's Chacon?

29:25.431 --> 29:26.864
- He ain't here.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.435
- I can see that.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.920
- I didn't hang ya.

29:32.921 --> 29:34.404
That wasn't my idea.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.939
That was Chacon's.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.407
- Yeah, that didn't stop
you from shootin' me.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.208
Did it, Billy?

29:39.111 --> 29:40.144
- I didn't shoot ya.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.979
That wasn't my idea.
- Yeah.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.898
- That was his too.

29:43.899 --> 29:45.816
- Yeah, did he also make
you rape and kill that girl?

29:45.818 --> 29:48.051
- What girl?
- Girl on the stagecoach.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.254
- Stagecoach?

29:50.255 --> 29:51.521
I don't know nothin'
'bout no stagecoach.

29:51.524 --> 29:54.024
- What do you think
I do for a livin'?

29:54.026 --> 29:56.827
I track and I hunt bad men.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.262
I'm real good at it.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.864
I've been doin' it since
before you was born,

30:00.866 --> 30:04.001
so don't tell you don't know
nothin' 'bout no stagecoach.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.536
- I didn't rape that girl.

30:05.538 --> 30:08.005
That wasn't me,
that was Culpepper.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.473
- I don't think so.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.575
I'm afraid not, Billy.

30:11.577 --> 30:15.813
See, a man's life is in
the tracks he leaves.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.049
I seen your tracks.

30:19.051 --> 30:23.487
You got them little boots, but
you're a murderin' bastard.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.957
When I saw you, you dragged
that girl from that stage

30:26.959 --> 30:28.225
and you took off
her into some wild.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.560
You raped her and you beat her.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.161
You stabbed her with the knife.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.231
- You can't prove that.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.567
Honestly, it wasn't me.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.135
They'll believe me.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.870
- You're right, Billy.

30:39.872 --> 30:44.007
They will 'cause you and I
we know the truth, don't we?

30:44.009 --> 30:44.942
Don't we?

30:47.313 --> 30:48.579
Don't we?!

30:48.581 --> 30:50.047
- No, please no!

30:50.049 --> 30:53.250
You gotta take me
back to the judge.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.318
- No, I don't.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.987
No, I don't.
- No no, please.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.188
- She say please, Billy?

30:58.190 --> 31:00.123
- She did.
- Did she say please?!

31:00.125 --> 31:01.058
- Yes!

31:02.261 --> 31:05.229
(water splashing)

31:12.938 --> 31:18.008
(river trickling)
(birds chirping)

31:22.948 --> 31:25.916
- There's not enough
to weigh here.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.154
- It must be worth
something, is it not?

31:31.156 --> 31:33.557
- (chuckles) Everything's
worth somethin'.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.626
- As to what I'm inquirin'.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.033
- Flink like that,

31:44.570 --> 31:47.671
probably get you
couple drinks maybe.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.040
- Told you it weren't
worth the ride in here.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.576
(trunk knocking)
(Binschii shouting)

31:52.578 --> 31:54.311
- What's that sound?

31:54.313 --> 31:56.914
What d'you got over there
in that (mumbles) trunk?

32:00.252 --> 32:02.085
- [Trader] I got my
own lil' Indian boy.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.988
- These were bad men.
- You don't say.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.124
- Though I'm tradin' him
to the Mexicans next week.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.659
Now he's worth somethin'.

32:09.995 --> 32:10.994
- [Binchii] I
thought I would die

32:10.996 --> 32:12.296
in the little box with no air.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.932
- We'll take those drinks now.

32:17.002 --> 32:17.968
- Mm-kay.

32:48.033 --> 32:51.001
(Trader chuckling)

32:54.640 --> 32:58.308
Marshall, I didn't
expect you so soon.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.043
- Where's the boy?

33:00.045 --> 33:02.412
- [Binschii] When I heard
his voice, I had hope again.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.783
- I had to put him in there.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.451
He went a little crazy
right after you left

33:07.453 --> 33:10.654
and I put him in
there for his own good

33:10.656 --> 33:13.123
to watch him, like you said.

33:13.125 --> 33:17.094
- I never said nothin' about
puttin' the boy in a trunk.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.666
You are one sick son
of a bitch, ain't ya?

33:22.668 --> 33:27.738
- (chuckles) Marshall, lemme
introduce you to my associates.

33:29.742 --> 33:33.377
Now Benson, you can have
as many pokes as you want.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.012
Goes for you too, Wilson.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.150
- Ooh my.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.087
- Gents, I got no
trouble with you.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.756
This boy and I
were just leavin'.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.428
- I do believe you're
miscalculating, Marshall.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.165
- It's time to leave.

34:04.343 --> 34:09.413
(guns blasting)
(bullets pinging)

34:14.119 --> 34:16.086
(piercing ringing)

34:16.088 --> 34:18.055
- [Binschii] It was
loud like thunder.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.426
- Alright, son?

34:30.135 --> 34:32.836
(gun and body thudding)

34:37.242 --> 34:40.277
(soft piano music)

34:43.115 --> 34:44.147
- [Binschii] I was angry at him

34:44.149 --> 34:45.549
for leavin' me with those men.

34:55.394 --> 35:00.197
Then he hugged me like my
father would and I felt safe.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.209
(western guitar music)

35:16.315 --> 35:19.249
(hooves clopping)

35:29.461 --> 35:32.529
(carriage clanking)

35:40.873 --> 35:42.472
- [John] We were hungry
and I promised him

35:42.474 --> 35:44.441
a breakfast of
flapjacks and eggs.

35:45.477 --> 35:49.212
I knew he had no idea
what I was talkin' about,

35:49.214 --> 35:52.616
but I figured he'd
like 'em just the same.

35:58.290 --> 36:02.359
(western piano music)
(muffled crosstalk)

36:02.361 --> 36:07.264
- I know if you help yourself
again, I'm gonna shoot you.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.209
- Hey Paco, you know
there's a little Indian boy

36:19.211 --> 36:21.211
sittin' at your table, right?

36:21.213 --> 36:22.179
- [Paco] What?

36:26.451 --> 36:29.853
- Okay, that's (mumbles).
- Who?

36:29.855 --> 36:31.555
- I watched him go home.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.957
- (chuckles) He didn't
do a very good job of it.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.325
- Very funny.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.860
(muffled speech)

36:44.536 --> 36:45.869
- What do you
think you're doin'?

36:45.871 --> 36:46.670
- How's that?

36:47.606 --> 36:49.306
- Don't serve his kind here.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.344
- You do this mornin'.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.546
- If you read the
sign out front,

36:56.548 --> 36:58.949
it said, "No Indians allowed."

36:58.951 --> 37:01.585
- Just 'cause you write it
down, don't make it right.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.255
I want an order of
flapjacks and eggs, bacon,

37:06.458 --> 37:07.624
crisp bacon and coffee.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.595
- Get up, boy.
- Let go of that boy!

37:13.365 --> 37:15.966
(head bashing)

37:17.002 --> 37:18.635
- Broke my nose!

37:18.637 --> 37:21.371
- Yeah, now go get
me my flapjacks.

37:25.310 --> 37:29.312
Anybody got somethin'
to say 'bout that?

37:29.314 --> 37:31.348
- Let's go tell the sheriff.
- Yeah.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.287
- I tell ya, I'm running
outta room at the school.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.022
New students arrive every day

37:39.024 --> 37:41.258
and the dormitories
are cholk full.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.526
- You have a good contract
with the government.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.328
You're gonna make a lotta money.

37:45.330 --> 37:50.300
- We're gonna make a lotta
money, but I need more room.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.368
- I'm workin' on it.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.820
- Sheriff, sheriff.

37:53.821 --> 37:55.337
There's this guy that
came into Paco's bar.

37:55.340 --> 37:58.041
- Hold on, hold
on, just slow down.

37:58.043 --> 37:58.942
- Sorry.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.343
Hey, Mrs. Braxton.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.461
- Hi.

38:01.462 --> 38:02.578
- There's this guy that
came into Paco's bar

38:02.581 --> 38:04.614
with a little Indian boy.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.550
He broke Paco's nose
and ordered flapjacks.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.518
- What?

38:08.520 --> 38:10.020
- That's what happened, sheriff.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.288
- Oh my.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.624
- Roy, gather up
some more of the boys

38:14.626 --> 38:16.493
and meet me at Paco's.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.427
- Okay.

38:25.504 --> 38:26.970
- I'll be along in a minute.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.706
- I guess lunch is over.

38:30.776 --> 38:33.576
- Yeah, but I'll
see you for dinner.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.592
- [John] Told ya they were good.

39:04.376 --> 39:07.110
- Don't you move or my
boys'll fill you with holes.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.812
- Nobody here's movin'.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.380
Just gettin' ready to go.

39:14.419 --> 39:17.487
- Who do you think you are
comin' in here insulting people?

39:18.824 --> 39:20.790
- Did you bring
enough help, sheriff?

39:22.828 --> 39:26.596
(rifle bashing)
(John thudding)

39:26.598 --> 39:28.064
- This is my town.

39:28.834 --> 39:29.699
(foot thudding)

39:29.701 --> 39:32.235
Look at me.

39:32.236 --> 39:34.770
You don't bring an Indian boy
in here, not in my Saloon.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.439
(foot thudding)

39:36.441 --> 39:37.407
Get him up

39:41.546 --> 39:42.512
and bring him too.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.128
He goes to the Indian school.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.745
- Sheriff, you gon'
wanna look at this.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.458
- You hurt that
boy, I'll kill ya!

40:37.469 --> 40:39.602
- Well who do we have here?

40:39.604 --> 40:43.173
- Sheriff sent him over, don't
know much else about him.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.642
- Let's have a look at him.

40:49.080 --> 40:53.583
Hiram, let's get
this young man--

40:54.486 --> 40:56.686
- I didn't know it at the time,

40:56.688 --> 40:59.489
but I was at one of those
Indian boarding school

40:59.491 --> 41:03.660
the US government set up for
us to be no longer Indians.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.795
- You're gonna like it here.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.530
- [Binschii] Millions
of Indian children

41:07.532 --> 41:10.133
were sent to these schools
against their own will

41:10.135 --> 41:11.701
and many have died there.

41:13.238 --> 41:16.940
- [John] First a noose around
my neck and now a jail cell.

41:16.942 --> 41:19.242
It didn't seem right.

41:19.244 --> 41:22.245
(jail clanking and squeaking)

41:22.247 --> 41:23.680
- Judge wants to see you.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.157
- Where's your posse, sheriff?

41:34.159 --> 41:37.527
Aren't you afraid I'ma rise
up and strike you down?

41:37.529 --> 41:38.862
- Man can't be too careful.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.703
- No cheap shot today, sheriff?

41:46.705 --> 41:47.871
- I'm sorry 'bout that.

41:47.873 --> 41:50.173
I didn't know you
were a marshall.

41:50.175 --> 41:50.974
- Yeah.

42:25.277 --> 42:27.277
- You're my new marshall.

42:27.279 --> 42:29.579
Quite an auspicious entrance

42:29.581 --> 42:32.916
bringing a savage to a dining
hall for flapjacks and eggs.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.986
- I was hungry, what was
I supposed to do with him?

42:38.056 --> 42:42.025
- Your only job was and is to
track down the outlaw Chacon

42:43.061 --> 42:46.696
and either bring him to face
justice or shoot him down.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.731
The question is
what were you doin'

42:48.733 --> 42:51.301
travelin' with a
mongrel Indian boy?

42:52.037 --> 42:54.371
- He was all alone.

42:54.372 --> 42:56.706
Chacon had killed his family.
- The question was rhetorical.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.308
I don't care.

42:59.711 --> 43:02.312
Wait a minute, you are
Marshall John Towne

43:02.314 --> 43:04.581
of Colorado, are you not?

43:05.317 --> 43:07.216
Are you not?

43:07.218 --> 43:08.251
- You know I am.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.922
- I don't know what
I know this morning.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.591
Let's start over, shall we?

43:15.660 --> 43:17.794
How was your journey, marshall?

43:17.796 --> 43:19.596
What can you report
about Chacon?

43:20.632 --> 43:23.733
These are the questions we
should be discussing in earnest

43:23.735 --> 43:25.001
and not why you are bringing

43:25.003 --> 43:27.904
a hostile, savage
mongrel to breakfast.

43:27.906 --> 43:29.372
- He's hardly a hostile.

43:29.374 --> 43:32.125
He's just a boy.

43:32.126 --> 43:34.877
- They're all hostiles and
savages or haven't you heard?

43:36.348 --> 43:38.915
You are very curious to me, sir.

43:38.917 --> 43:41.351
Very curious, indeed.

43:41.353 --> 43:44.854
Next you'll be tellin' me you
think women should vote, ha!

43:46.257 --> 43:49.826
Well the boy, as you call him,

43:49.828 --> 43:52.095
is no longer your
responsibility.

43:53.198 --> 43:57.934
You are to get back on the
trail and do what you do best.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.870
I don't wanna hear anymore
about Indian affairs from you.

44:09.848 --> 44:11.914
Is there something else?

44:11.916 --> 44:13.349
- What did you do with him?

44:15.053 --> 44:18.721
- You are really starting
to annoy me, sir.

44:18.723 --> 44:20.123
The little savage has been taken

44:20.125 --> 44:22.125
to Mrs. Braxton's Indian school

44:22.127 --> 44:24.927
where they know how to
take the starch out of 'em.

44:25.296 --> 44:28.297
But that's no longer
your affair, is it?

44:28.299 --> 44:32.735
Now I strongly suggest you
pick up your gun and badge

44:32.737 --> 44:35.938
and quickly leave my office
before I take them from you.

44:37.075 --> 44:39.075
You are a disgrace, sir.

44:40.078 --> 44:43.680
As a US Marshall, you
represent this great republic.

44:44.349 --> 44:47.884
To speak as you do,
it's reprehensible.

44:48.753 --> 44:50.920
This great nation
will visit the Indian

44:50.922 --> 44:54.057
with fire and sword until
there are none left.

44:54.059 --> 44:56.693
For the ones that are
will beg for mercy.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.762
It's people like
you are standing

44:59.764 --> 45:01.898
in the way of that progress.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.435
Had no idea had one of
your kind working for me.

45:06.304 --> 45:08.971
- How 'bout I remove
myself from your employ?

45:14.012 --> 45:15.445
- I see.

45:16.247 --> 45:19.949
You know Marshall,
man of your age,

45:19.951 --> 45:23.386
you don't have many years
of being a feared left.

45:23.388 --> 45:24.387
Then what?

45:24.389 --> 45:28.024
It'd be a shame to lose your
pension, don't ya think?

45:28.026 --> 45:30.960
Be lucky to get a bed in
an old soldier's home.

45:33.865 --> 45:37.800
You can't stop manifest
destiny; no one can.

45:37.802 --> 45:41.504
And you can't save the Indians
as much as you would dream to.

45:41.506 --> 45:44.040
- I can save this one boy.

45:44.042 --> 45:46.476
- You so much as go
near that little savage

45:46.478 --> 45:48.411
and I'll have you
back in chains.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.015
- Here it is.

45:53.017 --> 45:54.417
Isn't it beautiful?

45:54.419 --> 45:55.885
It's straight from France.

45:55.887 --> 45:58.187
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

46:07.966 --> 46:09.532
- [John] Maggie Butler
was the real reason

46:09.534 --> 46:11.768
I was in the Arizona territory.

46:12.303 --> 46:14.504
Lately she was all
I thought about.

46:16.941 --> 46:19.842
(teacup shattering)

46:19.844 --> 46:22.145
- I had always hoped he
would come back to me.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.481
But when he walked
into my store,

46:26.518 --> 46:28.985
I guess I wasn't truly prepared.

46:28.987 --> 46:29.986
John?

46:33.458 --> 46:34.524
- Hello, Maggie.

46:35.994 --> 46:37.193
- You need a bath.

46:39.164 --> 46:41.464
- That's a fine how do you
do after all these years.

46:41.466 --> 46:42.865
- Years?

46:42.867 --> 46:44.167
Going on 14 years.

46:45.103 --> 46:47.003
- Yeah, 'bout that.

46:53.945 --> 46:56.546
I'm sorry.
- For what?

46:56.548 --> 46:57.814
For leavin' me?

46:58.883 --> 47:00.516
- I heard your husband died.

47:03.454 --> 47:05.454
- You leave him outta this.

47:05.456 --> 47:06.289
He was a good man.

47:07.125 --> 47:08.958
- I just meant--

47:08.960 --> 47:11.160
- Why am I even talkin'
to you about this?

47:11.162 --> 47:13.229
You waltz in here
after all this time

47:13.231 --> 47:17.066
just to let me know you're
sorry that my husband died?

47:17.068 --> 47:18.835
- This isn't goin' as planned.

47:19.904 --> 47:21.871
- What'd you expect?
- I don't know.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.308
Maybe I should go.

47:25.310 --> 47:27.510
- Is that all you
know how to do?

47:29.180 --> 47:31.047
- I'm here, ain't I?

47:31.049 --> 47:33.883
Look I'm sorry for
leavin' you, Maggie.

47:34.586 --> 47:37.587
You reach a point in
life and ya look back

47:37.589 --> 47:39.088
what you did and didn't do.

47:39.858 --> 47:42.959
And my biggest regret
is not marryin' you.

47:43.628 --> 47:47.230
There's not a day goes
by I don't think of you.

47:48.266 --> 47:51.601
(soft romantic music)

47:53.171 --> 47:56.005
- I see you still have
the ring I bought you.

47:57.108 --> 47:58.307
- My prized possession.

48:02.513 --> 48:07.116
- I knew you'd never be a
shopkeeper or a businessman.

48:07.118 --> 48:08.551
I knew that.

48:08.553 --> 48:11.354
- A lawman's wife
ain't much of a life.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.356
- It shoulda been
my decision, John.

48:14.959 --> 48:16.626
- I know that now.

48:16.628 --> 48:20.930
I also know I'm doin'
a bad job at this.

48:20.932 --> 48:23.099
I rehearsed this so many times.

48:27.372 --> 48:29.138
- You're doin' just fine.

48:31.276 --> 48:33.242
- It's good to see you, Maggie.

48:33.244 --> 48:36.112
- [Maggie] It's good to see you.

48:43.388 --> 48:46.923
(soft romantic music)

48:57.302 --> 48:59.035
Love is a funny thing.

49:00.071 --> 49:04.206
When you have it, there is
no beginning and no end.

49:05.343 --> 49:06.309
It just is.

49:18.990 --> 49:21.691
- Now you wait
for me here, okay?

49:24.362 --> 49:26.629
¶ Q, R, S ¶

49:26.631 --> 49:28.631
¶ T, U, V ¶

49:28.633 --> 49:32.635
¶ W, X, Y and Z ¶

49:32.637 --> 49:37.006
¶ Now I know my ABCs ¶

49:37.008 --> 49:39.041
¶ A, B, C, D ¶

49:39.043 --> 49:41.043
¶ E, F, G ¶

49:41.045 --> 49:43.279
¶ H, I, J, K ¶

49:43.281 --> 49:46.115
¶ L, M, N, O, P ¶

49:56.327 --> 49:58.294
- [Binschii] I never
knew her name,

49:58.296 --> 50:00.396
but she was the first
girl I ever loved.

50:05.236 --> 50:07.670
I remember her
face 'til this day.

50:10.341 --> 50:11.741
- Hey, you sit!

50:19.350 --> 50:21.417
(door knocking loudly)

50:21.419 --> 50:23.119
- Come in, Hiram.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.299
What are we gonna call him?

50:39.103 --> 50:41.704
He looks like a Silas

50:43.174 --> 50:45.041
or a Simon.

50:46.110 --> 50:47.777
What do you think, Hiram?

50:47.779 --> 50:50.079
- We already have a Simon.

50:50.515 --> 50:52.314
- That's right.

50:52.316 --> 50:54.683
Silas it is.

50:54.685 --> 50:58.454
Silas, I am Mrs. Braxton.

51:00.725 --> 51:03.159
This is Mr. Hiram.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.334
There you go,
let's get this off.

51:13.805 --> 51:16.105
Oh, look at this hair.

51:18.443 --> 51:20.109
- He had this knife on him.

51:22.413 --> 51:24.113
- He did, did he?

51:24.816 --> 51:27.083
My little Indian warrior.

51:29.353 --> 51:30.553
D'you bring the scissors?

51:32.857 --> 51:35.224
- Ma'am, I forgot them.

51:37.862 --> 51:38.828
- Well?

51:47.405 --> 51:49.405
Stand still, Silas.

51:50.174 --> 51:55.511
Let the burdens be upon
the Lord. (chuckles)

51:57.315 --> 52:01.817
¶ Jesus loves you yes indeed ¶

52:01.819 --> 52:06.388
¶ For the Bible tells you so ¶

52:06.390 --> 52:10.759
¶ Jesus loves you yes indeed ¶

52:10.761 --> 52:15.531
¶ For the Bible tells you so ¶

52:15.533 --> 52:20.402
¶ Jesus loves you yes indeed ¶

52:20.404 --> 52:25.341
¶ For the Bible tells you so ¶

52:25.343 --> 52:29.812
¶ Jesus loves you yes indeed ¶

52:29.814 --> 52:32.248
You wanna sing,
you wanna try it?

52:33.918 --> 52:38.454
¶ Jesus loves you yes indeed ¶

52:38.456 --> 52:42.925
¶ For the Bible tells you so ¶

52:42.927 --> 52:45.895
(Mrs. Braxton humming)

52:45.897 --> 52:48.330
(soft piano music)
(birds chirping)

52:48.332 --> 52:50.299
- Sometimes I ask the Lord

52:52.236 --> 52:54.403
where all the goodness
is in this world.

52:58.476 --> 53:01.377
That's what I always
admired in you, John Towne;

53:03.314 --> 53:04.313
your goodness.

53:06.484 --> 53:08.284
You have a kind heart.

53:10.588 --> 53:12.588
One day I think people
will look back in shame

53:12.590 --> 53:14.390
at how we treated the Indians.

53:17.929 --> 53:20.930
Now you go get that boy
and you take him home.

53:23.234 --> 53:25.234
You just make sure
you come back to me.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.205
- I will.

53:30.274 --> 53:32.341
- I'll be waitin'.

53:40.284 --> 53:41.617
- [John] I felt whole again.

53:42.987 --> 53:45.621
I wondered why I had wasted
a lifetime without her.

53:47.892 --> 53:49.525
That was behind me now.

53:50.561 --> 53:53.229
I would spend the rest of
my days with Maggie Butler.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
- [Maggie] As I
watched him ride off,

53:59.704 --> 54:01.971
this time I knew he
would come back for me.

54:04.475 --> 54:05.441
- He ain't dead.

54:07.311 --> 54:08.477
- You just said he was dead.

54:08.479 --> 54:10.279
- No, O'Toole is dead.

54:10.281 --> 54:11.547
Talkin' about the marshall.

54:11.549 --> 54:12.514
- What marshall?

54:12.516 --> 54:13.649
- The marshall we hung.

54:13.651 --> 54:18.921
He's in town right now walkin'
around with some Indian kid.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.457
- You look so smart.

54:22.660 --> 54:24.326
(door knocking)

54:24.328 --> 54:25.561
Come in.

54:25.563 --> 54:28.731
(soft soothing music)

54:33.337 --> 54:36.739
All we have left
is to cut the hair.

54:36.741 --> 54:40.643
When you're done, bring
him to the classroom.

54:41.646 --> 54:42.945
- Yes, ma'am.

55:06.771 --> 55:08.570
Don't you resist me, little boy.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.540
You will do as I say.

55:12.743 --> 55:18.080
I am Hiram and I run this place.

55:18.082 --> 55:19.048
Lay down.

55:23.487 --> 55:28.557
(knife stabbing)
(Hiram wincing)

55:37.735 --> 55:39.702
He stabbed me.

55:39.704 --> 55:42.638
Come back here,
you lil' heathen!

55:54.085 --> 55:58.020
(climactic orchestral music)

56:04.095 --> 56:06.329
- [Binschii] I don't
know how it happened,

56:06.330 --> 56:08.564
but there he was on his
big horse and I ran to him.

56:23.748 --> 56:26.648
Then I saw her running
like me to freedom

56:26.650 --> 56:28.484
from the Indian boarding school.

56:29.420 --> 56:31.053
She smiled as she ran.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.030
(gun blasting)

56:42.032 --> 56:43.532
Then I heard the
shot and she fell.

56:46.137 --> 56:48.737
(gun blasting)

57:15.733 --> 57:18.834
- How could you shoot a
little girl in the back?

57:18.836 --> 57:21.637
(gun blasting)

57:23.908 --> 57:27.643
(somber orchestral music)

58:05.749 --> 58:09.885
I knew they would come for
us, so we rode hard all night.

58:40.584 --> 58:43.252
In the mornin', we were
in the high country.

58:43.254 --> 58:47.189
(triumphant orchestral music)

59:16.720 --> 59:20.255
(foreboding tribal music)

1:00:22.886 --> 1:00:24.886
I could feel
somethin' around us,

1:00:26.056 --> 1:00:27.723
but I couldn't see anything.

1:00:31.662 --> 1:00:34.830
(soft soothing music)

1:00:54.418 --> 1:00:58.687
We found an old cabin and
we went inside to rest.

1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:40.162
(foreboding tribal music)

1:01:44.902 --> 1:01:48.904
These Apaches were with
Chacon and they led 'em to us.

1:02:02.753 --> 1:02:05.053
- [Binschii] I knew he wanted
me to stay in the cabin.

1:02:05.055 --> 1:02:07.456
But when he fell asleep,
I slipped outside.

1:02:12.129 --> 1:02:14.096
I just wanted to be a kid again.

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:19.000
(birds chirping)

1:02:20.471 --> 1:02:23.138
Then it happened, I
was in the big arms

1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:25.040
of the man that
murdered my father.

1:02:27.044 --> 1:02:29.411
- [John] I don't
know what woke me.

1:02:29.413 --> 1:02:31.913
But when I awoke, I
had a sense of dread

1:02:31.915 --> 1:02:34.816
and the little boy was
nowhere to be seen.

1:02:34.818 --> 1:02:38.920
(somber orchestral music)

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:40.956
(arrow whooshing)
(John wincing)

1:02:40.958 --> 1:02:43.158
An arrow in the shoulder
is all I remember,

1:02:44.428 --> 1:02:46.428
then the world went
dark very quickly.

1:02:47.531 --> 1:02:50.232
(John thudding)

1:03:07.117 --> 1:03:10.819
- [Binschii] I remember thinking
that this truly was the end

1:03:10.821 --> 1:03:12.454
as we rode into the forest.

1:03:13.991 --> 1:03:19.060
(fire crackling)
(frogs croaking)

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:26.568
(men laughing)
(muffled crosstalk)

1:03:26.570 --> 1:03:28.036
That night, they were drinking

1:03:28.038 --> 1:03:31.173
and more Apaches seeped
in from the darkness.

1:03:46.190 --> 1:03:49.157
The man that murdered my
father was givin' them rifles.

1:03:53.297 --> 1:03:57.499
(men speaking foreign language)

1:04:09.146 --> 1:04:12.147
They yell and scream and fought.

1:04:12.149 --> 1:04:15.517
(men drunken shouting)

1:04:21.058 --> 1:04:23.191
I couldn't stop looking at
my grandfather's necklace

1:04:23.193 --> 1:04:24.993
around that big man's neck.

1:04:25.863 --> 1:04:31.066
(muffled crosstalk)
(fire crackling)

1:04:41.945 --> 1:04:45.080
Then some of the Apaches
left with the rifles.

1:04:45.082 --> 1:04:48.016
(hooves clopping)

1:05:08.972 --> 1:05:11.539
After the rest fell
asleep, he took me.

1:05:11.541 --> 1:05:14.059
I thought to kill
me, but instead

1:05:14.060 --> 1:05:16.578
we went into a dark mineshaft
where he hid his treasure.

1:05:23.654 --> 1:05:25.287
- [John] It was
dark when I woke.

1:05:27.057 --> 1:05:29.991
I snapped the arrow and
pulled it outta my body.

1:05:29.993 --> 1:05:35.063
(arrow snapping)
(John wincing)

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:38.133
Then I ran all night
followin' their tracks.

1:05:39.202 --> 1:05:43.071
(adventurous western music)

1:05:55.252 --> 1:05:57.719
In the mornin', I found
'em camped in a meadow

1:05:57.721 --> 1:06:00.622
with their horses nearby
huddled up together in a bunch.

1:06:14.237 --> 1:06:17.439
It was an easy thing
to get them goin'.

1:06:19.309 --> 1:06:24.379
(intense orchestral music)
(hooves stomping)

1:06:33.724 --> 1:06:36.391
- [Bandit] Where the horses run?

1:06:37.394 --> 1:06:40.195
(gun blasting)

1:06:58.315 --> 1:07:03.318
(gun blasting)
(bullets pinging)

1:07:32.249 --> 1:07:33.281
(gun blasting)
(Culpepper groaning)

1:07:33.283 --> 1:07:36.251
(river trickling)

1:08:09.719 --> 1:08:14.355
(gun blasting)
(birds chirping)

1:08:14.357 --> 1:08:17.125
- You just won't die, will you?

1:08:18.361 --> 1:08:19.327
You throw that
pistol over the edge

1:08:19.329 --> 1:08:21.229
or I'll snap this boy's neck.

1:08:49.359 --> 1:08:50.325
- [John] I was too
weak from the arrow

1:08:50.327 --> 1:08:52.260
to put up much of a fight.

1:08:52.262 --> 1:08:57.332
(intense western music)
(John wincing)

1:09:04.207 --> 1:09:06.875
(fist thudding)

1:09:23.193 --> 1:09:25.460
- Marshall, think you can fly?

1:09:26.363 --> 1:09:29.264
(knife stabbing)

1:09:32.302 --> 1:09:35.470
(tribal guitar music)

1:09:41.444 --> 1:09:44.412
(Chacon shouting)

1:09:50.587 --> 1:09:51.853
- [Binschii] Before
we left his place,

1:09:51.855 --> 1:09:53.454
I showed him the mineshaft.

1:09:54.457 --> 1:09:56.291
- Let's see what's in here.

1:10:00.964 --> 1:10:02.430
Oh wow.

1:10:12.609 --> 1:10:16.277
I had never been a rich
man until that moment.

1:10:16.279 --> 1:10:19.214
(John chuckling)

1:10:29.259 --> 1:10:34.329
(birds chirping)
(soft serene music)

1:11:37.927 --> 1:11:41.562
(intense foreboding music)

1:11:58.381 --> 1:12:00.448
- Is that them?
- Yeah.

1:12:01.451 --> 1:12:04.986
Do what you want with the
boy, but the marshall's mine.

1:12:04.988 --> 1:12:06.487
All mine.

1:12:06.489 --> 1:12:08.489
- I'm gonna take that
little Indian boy's scalp

1:12:08.491 --> 1:12:09.791
and feed it to my pups.

1:12:12.696 --> 1:12:15.663
(hooves stomping)

1:12:21.004 --> 1:12:23.004
- [John] I had my
pick as they rode in.

1:12:24.574 --> 1:12:26.341
I shot Roy first.

1:12:27.677 --> 1:12:29.010
(rifle blasting)
(Roy wincing)

1:12:29.012 --> 1:12:30.545
I figured he would
be my biggest threat

1:12:30.547 --> 1:12:32.747
since the sheriff
would be reckless

1:12:32.749 --> 1:12:35.550
'cause he wanted revenge
for me shootin' his woman.

1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:40.421
I shot Roy in the gut for how
he was rough with the boy.

1:12:40.423 --> 1:12:45.493
(rifle blasting)
(soft foreboding music)

1:12:51.101 --> 1:12:53.835
(rifle blasting)

1:13:02.145 --> 1:13:05.079
(rifle blasting)

1:13:08.718 --> 1:13:13.788
(guns blasting)
(intense western music)

1:13:33.743 --> 1:13:35.576
- Oh god, my shoulder!

1:13:35.578 --> 1:13:36.677
Ow, my shoulder!

1:13:38.448 --> 1:13:39.414
God.

1:13:41.184 --> 1:13:42.550
- Don't shoot no more.

1:13:42.552 --> 1:13:44.552
Please don't shoot.
- Ow, my shoulder.

1:13:45.488 --> 1:13:46.454
Help!

1:13:48.057 --> 1:13:50.725
My shoulder.
- Don't shoot!

1:13:52.529 --> 1:13:55.163
- My shoulder!
- Get up.

1:13:56.900 --> 1:13:58.599
Where ya hit?
- My shoulder.

1:13:58.601 --> 1:13:59.834
Help, my shoulder.

1:13:59.836 --> 1:14:00.768
I'm shot.

1:14:02.105 --> 1:14:05.473
Ow, my shoulder.
- Don't shoot, please.

1:14:09.646 --> 1:14:11.746
- Come out here to
kill a boy, did you?

1:14:11.748 --> 1:14:13.581
What's wrong with you?!

1:14:13.583 --> 1:14:16.717
How 'bout I just blow you
to kingdom come right now?

1:14:18.755 --> 1:14:21.756
Now you with your left hand,
you take that gun outta there

1:14:21.758 --> 1:14:23.691
and you throw it over there.

1:14:23.693 --> 1:14:24.926
You look at me now!
- My shoulder.

1:14:24.928 --> 1:14:26.127
- You see me?

1:14:26.129 --> 1:14:26.928
You throw it.

1:14:27.931 --> 1:14:30.198
Now you, stand up son!

1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:31.732
- Yes, sir.
- Be a man.

1:14:34.904 --> 1:14:36.204
Now you stay here,
you understand me?

1:14:36.206 --> 1:14:37.805
You don't move.

1:14:37.807 --> 1:14:39.774
Say yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

1:14:42.745 --> 1:14:45.713
(sheriff wincing)

1:14:51.788 --> 1:14:52.820
- You bastard.

1:15:00.163 --> 1:15:01.629
- Look at me, sheriff.

1:15:03.900 --> 1:15:06.834
(rifle blasting)

1:15:17.847 --> 1:15:18.880
Is he kin to you?

1:15:23.853 --> 1:15:26.254
You tell me why I shouldn't
kill you right now.

1:15:27.657 --> 1:15:28.623
Tell me why.

1:15:29.259 --> 1:15:30.191
Speak up, son!

1:15:30.193 --> 1:15:33.761
- We're young.
- Yeah, you're young.

1:15:37.667 --> 1:15:40.801
- I tell you what,
get on 'em horses.

1:15:41.871 --> 1:15:44.305
If I see you back
here, I will kill you.

1:15:44.307 --> 1:15:46.774
You bring your uncle,
I'll kill your uncle.

1:15:46.776 --> 1:15:48.843
You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

1:15:48.845 --> 1:15:49.810
- Now git!

1:16:00.957 --> 1:16:03.891
(hooves stomping)

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:09.230
You better get, boy!

1:16:22.045 --> 1:16:25.613
(soothing piano music)

1:16:43.666 --> 1:16:46.734
(soft serene music)

1:17:28.044 --> 1:17:31.646
(soothing piano music)

1:17:41.791 --> 1:17:44.959
(serene tribal music)

1:18:09.886 --> 1:18:12.887
I gave the boy some gold,
and jewels and some green backs.

1:18:13.923 --> 1:18:17.024
I figured it would set him
up right in the future.

1:18:17.026 --> 1:18:18.693
It was the least I could do.

1:18:24.333 --> 1:18:28.736
- [Binschii] It felt good to
be in my land, Navajo land.

1:18:28.738 --> 1:18:32.006
(soft orchestral music)

1:18:50.993 --> 1:18:53.728
- [John] This Navajo land,
was beautiful country.

1:18:54.297 --> 1:18:56.931
Some of the most beautiful
country I've ever seen.

1:19:24.994 --> 1:19:28.229
(soothing piano music)

1:19:43.446 --> 1:19:46.514
We have been through
a lot together.

1:19:51.854 --> 1:19:53.854
I was gonna miss this boy.

1:19:53.856 --> 1:19:55.222
He was like a son to me now.

1:20:00.530 --> 1:20:03.097
- [Binschii] It was hard
sayin' goodbye to this man.

1:20:07.570 --> 1:20:11.572
I would always remember him
surrounded by the wind and sand.

1:20:11.574 --> 1:20:13.474
Like in my grandfather's story,

1:20:13.476 --> 1:20:15.176
this time it was a good wind.

1:20:16.946 --> 1:20:20.147
I often wonder if my grandfather
had sent this man to me.

1:20:21.217 --> 1:20:24.285
I guess I will never know,
but I'm glad I knew him.

1:20:26.055 --> 1:20:28.489
- [John] It gave me great
joy to see him home.

1:20:35.965 --> 1:20:37.865
(Binschii speaking
foreign language)

1:20:37.867 --> 1:20:40.968
(serene vocal music)

1:20:49.178 --> 1:20:54.281
- [Binschii] I was home
in the arms of my mother.

1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:14.235
(somber piano music)

1:21:21.177 --> 1:21:22.877
I never saw him again.

1:21:52.642 --> 1:21:56.043
(Spanish guitar music)
