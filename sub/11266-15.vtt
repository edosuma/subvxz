WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.880
Previously, on 90210:
Screw my spiritual journey!

00:04.922 --> 00:07.048
I want my money back!
Oh, I'm sorry,

00:07.090 --> 00:09.426
Naomi, but you already
signed the deed

00:09.468 --> 00:12.220
to my foundation-- like it
or not, that land is mine.
Emily told me

00:12.262 --> 00:13.597
she saw you guys making out

00:13.639 --> 00:15.891
on the back porch,
right before my big audition...

00:15.933 --> 00:18.018
which I then
proceeded to screw up royally!

00:18.059 --> 00:19.394
Well, I just wanted to tell you,
I am so glad

00:19.436 --> 00:21.146
I took a chance on you.
You got the part!

00:21.188 --> 00:23.064
Are you serious?

00:23.106 --> 00:26.902
I trusted you. I don't think
I can see you anymore.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.487
NAVID:
Don't you get it?
That girl Kaitlyn

00:28.529 --> 00:30.405
is a junior; which means

00:30.447 --> 00:32.908
my dad put an underage girl
in his movie.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.410
You're not getting
your daughter back, are you?
I can't be a mother.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.329
But I can totally be
a reality star!

00:38.330 --> 00:39.623
Oh, just stop.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.626
I can't do this anymore.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.753
I can't keep running around
behind her back with you.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.297
NAVID:
I-I don't love you. No.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.758
Not anymore.
He's cheating on me.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.887
Why would you think that?
Because I found this
in his room.

00:52.928 --> 00:55.347
(sighing)

01:02.396 --> 01:04.899
I just can't get over the fact
that Navid was cheating on me.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.441
Mmm. Men are pigs.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.736
Yeah....
I guess.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.071
But I am surprised about Navid.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.990
I know!
He was always so faithful,

01:13.032 --> 01:14.783
and so loyal.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.368
No, I'm surprised that he could
even get a side piece.

01:16.410 --> 01:20.455
But, yeah, that he was faithful
and loyal and all that.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.165
I blame the slut
who seduced him.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.503
I wonder who she is.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.838
Okay, okay,

01:27.880 --> 01:29.088
let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.966
I mean, Ade,
you're right.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.133
It doesn't sound
like Navid.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.385
He's... he's
not the type.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.804
He's loyal and faithful,
and he wouldn't...

01:35.846 --> 01:37.598
Yeah, but I found
another girl's earring

01:37.639 --> 01:39.182
in his bedroom.
I know.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.977
But that's... that is
just circumstantial evidence.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.062
It could be anyone's.

01:43.102 --> 01:44.521
It could be...
like, his sister's!

01:44.563 --> 01:46.023
He's got, like,
18 sisters, you know?

01:46.065 --> 01:48.067
It could be one of theirs.
I'm sure of it.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.277
Yeah, you're
probably right.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.529
MAN:
Cut! Oh,

01:52.571 --> 01:54.573
that is just great, girls.
Really, really good.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.991
We had a little bit
of a lighting issue.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.785
We're going to clean that up.
But this is fantastic.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.036
Terrific. Really good energy.

01:59.078 --> 02:00.704
(laughs)

02:00.746 --> 02:02.081
Can you believe this?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.164
We're going to be on TV.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.541
Hell, yeah!

02:04.583 --> 02:05.960
Oh, not too much blush.
Okay.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.544
Uh, I don't know
if I'm really...

02:07.586 --> 02:08.586
uh, up for this.
I'm not

02:08.628 --> 02:10.047
a reality show type person.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.214
ADRIANNA:
Silver! No! You have to.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.675
Giles said that I need
a posse for the pilot.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.260
(laughing):
I am your posse.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.303
Or you could be mine.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.638
Okay, does it seem

02:17.679 --> 02:19.640
a little uncool that we're
trashing Navid

02:19.681 --> 02:21.224
like this, if it's
going to be on national TV?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.602
Um... no.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.937
Navid deserves it.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.187
Even if he didn't
cheat on her, he dumped her.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.023
GILES:
Okay, we're ready to go again.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.357
Adrianna, great energy.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.401
All right? Naomi...
camera loves you.
(Naomi guffaws)

02:31.443 --> 02:33.862
The feeling is mutual.
GILES: All right,

02:33.904 --> 02:35.238
Silver, babe, tiny note.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.406
Try not to look like you're
being tortured, yeah?

02:36.448 --> 02:38.325
Oh! Yeah, okay.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.578
So, let's take it again
from the top. And... Action!

02:41.620 --> 02:44.665
I just can't believe
Navid was cheating on me.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.128
Thanks again for breakfast, Mom.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.504
You're welcome.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.880
We should do this more.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.215
Here you go, Mrs. Shirazi.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.676
Thank you.
WAITER:
Shirazi.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.136
You related to that
kiddie-porn guy?

02:59.138 --> 03:00.347
Uh, no.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.849
Uh, no relation.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.319
Of course, Alexander the Great
was the most controversial

03:14.361 --> 03:17.489
of the Macedon kings
and he remains so today.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.407
The Greeks in Alexander's time,

03:19.449 --> 03:22.410
they did not think about sexual
orientation the way we do now.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.038
Looks like Teddy was born
in the wrong era.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.288
(scattered laughter)

03:25.330 --> 03:27.290
No talking. Now...

03:27.332 --> 03:31.336
When Alexander lost Hephaestion,
he was overcome with grief...

03:31.378 --> 03:33.380
MAN:
The last thing I did?

03:33.421 --> 03:36.216
Oh, darling, it was
so far off Broadway.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.634
It was in Newark.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.302
(guffaws)
Thanks, darling.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.680
Sure.
And by the way, everyone,

03:41.722 --> 03:44.058
I'm Annie, the intern
at the Abbott Playhouse.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.060
So if you need anything at all,
please just let me know.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.310
I'll be at your beck and call.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.645
Hi, guys!

03:48.687 --> 03:49.730
Hey!
Here you go.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.898
Oh, thanks, Annie.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.482
Here.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.151
I really appreciate

03:54.193 --> 03:56.444
the good attitude
you've had about everything.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.738
Mm!
I know how much

03:57.779 --> 03:59.156
you wanted a part
in the play.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.699
Oh, please.
I'm just happy

04:00.741 --> 04:02.617
I got an audition.
I knew it was a long shot.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.162
Okay, people, we'll begin
the read-through shortly.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.705
We are just waiting
on one more actress.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.915
WOMAN:
Sorry I'm late!

04:07.956 --> 04:09.541
And here she is,
right on cue.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.835
Everyone, this is
Emily Bradford.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.212
She will be our Cecily.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.672
(applause)

04:15.714 --> 04:17.882
MAN:
Welcome, darling!

04:19.218 --> 04:20.427
Thanks.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.059
I'm so excited!

04:45.119 --> 04:46.161
It was unbelievable, Mom,

04:46.203 --> 04:47.746
The way that she
was just prancing

04:47.788 --> 04:49.623
around the theater
like she owned the place.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.917
She's such a snake and a phony!

04:51.959 --> 04:54.253
I don't get it!
How did this happen?!

04:54.294 --> 04:55.921
Annie, try to calm down.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.215
But she went behind my back
and she stole the part!

04:58.257 --> 04:59.633
I knew that I couldn't
trust her.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.760
I knew it!
Emily.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.347
Annie,
I am so sorry.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.101
I knew I shouldn't have gone out
with the cast last night.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.812
I should have come right home
and just talked to you.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.731
You know what, Emily,
I really don't want to hear it.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.608
No, I swear I did not mean
for this to happen.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.902
When you left the audition,
the director assumed

05:18.944 --> 05:20.320
I was there to audition, too,

05:20.361 --> 05:22.614
and I just figured, you know,
what the heck?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.116
It'd be a good
experience, right?

05:24.158 --> 05:26.994
I-I never dreamed
that I would actually get it.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.537
Yeah, right.
Annie,
hear her out.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.124
Emily, don't you think you
should've told her?
I know.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.917
I know. I just...

05:33.959 --> 05:35.752
I knew how bad
she wanted the part,

05:35.794 --> 05:37.754
and... I didn't know how.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.215
I'm so sorry, Annie.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.135
Look, if it's that
upsetting to you,

05:43.177 --> 05:44.469
then I just, you know,

05:44.511 --> 05:45.887
I won't take the part;
I'll quit.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.514
Good. Quit.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.765
DEBBIE: Annie, you
don't mean that.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.549
She conned me out of $200,000...

17:29.590 --> 17:31.885
Yeah. I got the story already.
Rich trust fund kid

17:31.926 --> 17:34.053
realizes the world
doesn't revolve around her.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.680
Front page news definitely.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.723
(laughter)

17:38.933 --> 17:41.352
Good-bye, Naomi.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.396
Go in peace.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.981
Namaste.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.232
FOLLOWERS:
Namaste.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.703
Naomi.
What?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.162
Wait up!

18:00.204 --> 18:02.248
You know what, I'm not
really in the mood

18:02.289 --> 18:04.417
to look for soil
samples, Max.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.168
You're...
What, an idiot?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.254
Yeah, I know that already.
Thank you very much.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.423
I was going to say "upset."

18:10.464 --> 18:14.510
Well, it doesn't take a 2,400 IQ
to figure that out, does it?

18:14.552 --> 18:15.929
There's no such thing as...

18:15.970 --> 18:17.137
Never mind.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.264
Are you okay?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.517
No, I'm not okay.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.063
I'm an airhead.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.689
You were right.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.608
Why? What happened?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.902
Who was that creepy
lady in white?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.779
A con artist

18:32.820 --> 18:34.280
who tricked me
into giving her

18:34.321 --> 18:36.532
hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.034
How?

18:38.076 --> 18:39.285
I don't know.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.787
'Cause I'm a lame idiot.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.623
She made me think I was

18:43.664 --> 18:45.833
this "chosen person."

18:45.875 --> 18:48.920
She said that
I was special.

18:51.171 --> 18:54.550
Well, I wouldn't expect a genius
like you to understand.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.971
It's like what Morpheus
told Neo.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.555
What?

18:59.597 --> 19:02.934
You know, in The Matrix?

19:02.976 --> 19:05.061
The movie with the hideous
pleather coats-- I saw it.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.022
Hey, um...

19:08.064 --> 19:11.275
we all want to feel
important, you know?

19:11.317 --> 19:14.320
Like we have some
special significance.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.740
So you are not lame.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.660
You're just human.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.707
Thanks.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.878
(rustling)

19:30.920 --> 19:32.672
(bird calling)

19:32.713 --> 19:34.841
Oh, Athene cunicularia!

19:34.882 --> 19:37.802
Do you know what that was?!
Are you nerding out

19:37.844 --> 19:39.553
all over our nice moment?

19:39.595 --> 19:40.847
It's a burrowing owl.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.181
It's an amateur
ornithologist's dream.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.474
It's-it's...

19:43.516 --> 19:44.976
Do you know how
rare those are?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.352
Uh, no, I don't.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.729
Oh, man.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.230
Aw, it's gone.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.775
They're fascinating.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.234
They-they live in burrows

19:54.276 --> 19:56.487
and they're small, but they have
these really long legs.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.865
They're kind of dorky looking,
but cute, you know?

19:58.906 --> 20:00.616
Anyway, they're
a species

20:00.658 --> 20:02.326
of concern in California.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.330
You... you mean, like,
they're protected?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.082
Yeah, by the Department
of Fish and Game.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.502
So if there's owls--

20:11.544 --> 20:14.421
burrowing owls that live on this
land-- no one can build on it?

20:16.132 --> 20:18.551
In fact,
no one could sell it.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.803
The state would have
to cancel the land sale.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.763
Then I would get
my money back.

20:22.805 --> 20:23.931
Would this really work?

20:23.973 --> 20:26.392
Sure, if we
had some proof.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.019
We've got to find
that owl.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.189
(imitating owl hooting)

20:36.235 --> 20:38.029
ADRIANNA:
It's just crazy, you know.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.573
I mean, one point, Navid
and I are going to get married

20:40.614 --> 20:42.033
and now we're over.
It's insane.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.202
Yeah.
Oh, my God, did I tell
you about the nightmare

20:44.243 --> 20:45.703
I had last night?

20:45.745 --> 20:47.205
Um, yep, actually you-you did...

20:47.246 --> 20:48.622
Navid and I
were at prom,

20:48.664 --> 20:49.874
and everything
was wonderful.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.375
And we were
just about to kiss.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.836
And suddenly, it wasn't
Navid at all.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.171
It was Perez Hilton.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.463
I screamed so loud,

20:56.505 --> 20:57.715
I'm surprised nobody called
the police.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.300
GILES:
Okay, cut.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.136
What's wrong now?
Uh, what's right?

21:02.178 --> 21:05.347
Ivy, sweetie, you can't
look into the camera.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.100
Um, right, right,
of course.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.435
You know, the thing is,
I just, I don't watch

21:09.476 --> 21:10.728
a lot of reality shows,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.354
so, um, I don't really know

21:12.396 --> 21:14.190
how this works, right?

21:14.232 --> 21:16.525
Actually, maybe I just shouldn't
be a part of it.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.652
No, no, no.
I need a posse.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.071
(groans)
GILES:
No, you know what?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.948
She's not... It's--
the real problem is

21:21.989 --> 21:23.824
all we have is
hours of you

21:23.866 --> 21:24.909
whining about
your ex-boyfriend.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.244
Whining?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.578
Yeah. Look, I don't
want to be harsh,

21:27.620 --> 21:29.247
but, I mean, we
don't have a show here.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.582
Yeah. Yes, we do.
We totally have a show.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.085
Okay, let's just make it more
about my career.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.837
You know, that's what
this is supposed to be.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.965
It's my comeback.
I know, but
what comeback?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.761
I mean... just
give me a chance, okay?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.429
I will do anything.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.223
I'll sing, I'll dance.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.226
I'll do whatever it takes.

21:50.268 --> 21:53.520
Hey, maybe, um, maybe Navid and
Dixon could just, like, give you

21:53.562 --> 21:55.648
a part in that music video
they're shooting.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.442
Navid's shooting a video?

21:58.484 --> 21:59.652
Whoo!

22:04.740 --> 22:05.699
Liam!

22:05.741 --> 22:06.700
Emily.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.368
Hey, what are you
doing here?

22:08.410 --> 22:10.788
Oh, didn't Annie tell you?
I'm in the play.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.081
No kidding!

22:12.123 --> 22:13.874
I didn't even know
you auditioned.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.294
Congratulations.
That's incredible.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.628
I know. Thanks.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.046
I can hardly believe it.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.299
Yeah. Hey, uh,
do you know where Annie is?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.633
I'm supposed to meet her here.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.761
Oh, um, she's on a run.

22:25.803 --> 22:29.140
She probably tried to call.
My stupid phone is dead.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.142
Mm.
Well, she should be back soon.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.144
Hey, do you want to,

22:33.186 --> 22:35.980
um, do you want
to help me run lines?

22:36.022 --> 22:40.151
Um... okay.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.986
Okay. Come on. Follow me.

22:42.028 --> 22:47.574
♪ ♪

23:03.216 --> 23:05.092
Looks like we
pulled it off.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.177
Of course, man.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.303
Never had
any doubts about it.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.763
Yeah, well, I did.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.141
Candy corn?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.018
I'm good.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.811
(both chuckle)

23:15.853 --> 23:16.729
Uh-oh.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.646
Navid!

23:19.357 --> 23:20.398
What the hell?

23:22.318 --> 23:24.320
Ade, what are you doing?

23:24.362 --> 23:25.654
What is all this?

23:25.696 --> 23:26.989
It's my reality show.

23:27.031 --> 23:27.990
It's pretty cool, huh?

23:28.032 --> 23:30.117
So, I was hoping
to meet Nelly.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.661
I heard that he really liked
to collaborate with other

23:32.703 --> 23:36.082
and maybe he'd want me to
do a cameo in his video.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.334
(chuckles)
It's worth a try, right?

23:38.376 --> 23:39.919
Are you joking?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.087
Please?

23:41.128 --> 23:43.005
Giles, my producer,
thinks it would be

23:43.047 --> 23:44.340
really great for the pilot.

23:44.382 --> 23:47.218
Yeah, uh, well, I don't care
about your pilot, okay?

23:47.260 --> 23:49.136
I'm trying to run
a business here,

23:49.178 --> 23:51.805
and this is a very
big day for me, Ade.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.515
You got to get out of here.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.102
Navid, come on.
I really need this.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.311
Ade, I can't
help you, okay?

23:57.353 --> 23:58.687
It's not like it's
my music video.

23:58.729 --> 23:59.980
Seriously, just go.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.190
Now.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.193
Sorry I bothered you.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.152
Can you believe her?

24:10.616 --> 24:12.118
What do we do now?

24:12.159 --> 24:14.412
You heard what he said--
it's not his video.

24:14.452 --> 24:17.164
So go over his head.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.540
Go talk to Nelly himself.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.127
I can't.
Navid would kill me.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.129
Look, Adrianna, do you want
a show or not?

24:26.924 --> 24:30.468
Yo, I don't really know
about that last dancer, yo.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.469
Ten minutes, man.

24:31.511 --> 24:32.470
Thanks, man.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.681
Will you grab me
something to drink?

24:36.100 --> 24:39.812
Um, excuse me? Nelly?
Yeah?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.397
Hi, I'm Adrianna
Tate-Duncan.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.523
Oh, it is so nice
to meet you.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.858
I am such a huge fan.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.320
Nice to meet you, too.

24:47.361 --> 24:51.240
So, I was wondering if maybe
I could be in your music video.

24:51.282 --> 24:53.075
For real?
(Adrianna laughs)

24:53.117 --> 24:54.492
Are you a dancer?

24:54.534 --> 24:56.745
Yeah! I can dance.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.705
Wait a minute.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.249
I know you.
You're the chick

25:00.291 --> 25:02.584
that stole the songs from
the dead Mexican dude.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.712
That's me! Adrianna.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.673
You trippin'.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.091
Yo, somebody come
get this chick

25:09.133 --> 25:10.676
before she steals my songs, too!

25:10.717 --> 25:13.429
Oh! Whoa-whoa! Nelly,
is this girl bothering you?
Yo, V.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.555
I don't know how
she got in here,

25:15.597 --> 25:18.351
but I'll be in
my trailer until
you figure it out.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.770
Okay, who are you
and how'd you get in here?

25:22.980 --> 25:25.232
I'm a friend of Navid's.
Navid!

25:28.986 --> 25:30.237
She a friend of yours?

25:30.279 --> 25:32.572
Ade, what are you
doing here?

25:32.614 --> 25:34.283
She upset Nelly,
that's what she's doing.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.284
Who the hell is she?

25:35.326 --> 25:36.994
Uh, she's nobody.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.162
And she's leaving.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.379
That's great!
Now I gotta go talk

25:46.420 --> 25:48.214
Nelly out of his trailer.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.590
God knows how long this
is gonna set us back.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.218
You are covering any overtime.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.927
Of course.
I'm really sorry, Vaughn.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.971
I can't believe you guys
would let your friends

25:56.013 --> 25:57.306
wander all over set.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.724
What kind of amateur operation
are you running here?!

25:58.765 --> 26:00.726
Get it together, man.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.195
Adrianna! Hold up!

26:13.364 --> 26:14.448
Turn that off!

26:14.490 --> 26:15.366
Right now!

26:16.658 --> 26:18.285
(mouthing)

26:18.327 --> 26:20.829
Do you realize
what you just ruined?!
You're the one

26:20.871 --> 26:22.956
who ruined my chance
at having a reality show.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.334
I can't believe you
wouldn't help me.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.253
Oh, my God.
I can't even believe

26:27.294 --> 26:28.586
how totally self-absorbed
you are.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.506
You don't think Ade!

26:30.548 --> 26:32.174
You don't think
about anybody but you!

26:32.216 --> 26:34.634
Is that why
you cheated on me?

26:38.305 --> 26:40.266
You did, didn't you?

26:43.810 --> 26:44.811
Fine.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.191
I cheated. I'm sorry.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.026
What I should have done

26:51.068 --> 26:53.153
is break up with you
a long time ago.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.161
GILES:
And cut!

27:01.203 --> 27:02.746
This is gold!

27:02.788 --> 27:05.291
This is the kind of drama
I was talking about!

27:05.332 --> 27:08.043
Do you think we can get him
to sign a release?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.051
All right, look,

27:16.093 --> 27:17.553
I know why you've been
blowing off school.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.472
I've been there, you know?

27:21.639 --> 27:24.101
What are we
doing up here?

27:24.143 --> 27:28.397
Well, I thought you could use
a little tennis therapy.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.820
Haven't held one of
these in a while.

27:39.657 --> 27:40.576
(grunts)

27:44.622 --> 27:46.540
So, you want
to talk about it?

27:46.582 --> 27:49.627
I don't know,
I just... I'm so angry!

27:51.170 --> 27:52.712
At myself; at Ian.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.132
I can't believe I came out
of the closet for that guy.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.926
You didn't come out
of the closet for Ian.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.470
You came out for you.

27:59.512 --> 28:03.765
Yeah, well, it doesn't
matter why I came out.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.309
I can't go back.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.726
Is that what
you really want?

28:06.768 --> 28:09.188
Yes.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.191
No... God, I don't know.

28:12.232 --> 28:16.778
Teddy, I don't think you can see
this right now, but...

28:16.820 --> 28:18.489
you're being honest
with yourself

28:18.531 --> 28:20.533
and everyone else.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.660
It's only gonna lead
to good things.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.329
Really? Like what?

28:25.371 --> 28:27.789
MAN:
Ow!

28:27.831 --> 28:29.833
MAN:
What the hell?!

28:32.169 --> 28:35.422
Keep the ice on it.
You'll be fine.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.140
Hey, I'm kinda the guy
that hit you

28:45.182 --> 28:47.476
with that tennis ball.
Sorry about that.

28:47.518 --> 28:49.728
Oh, well, I thought it'd be
a rough game tonight,

28:49.769 --> 28:52.231
I just wasn't expecting
to get hit off the field.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.192
(chuckles)
You got a killer serve.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.860
Thanks, I guess.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.737
I'm Teddy.
This is Silver.

28:58.778 --> 28:59.738
Hey.

28:59.779 --> 29:00.947
I'm Marco. What were you

29:00.989 --> 29:02.658
guys doing
on the roof anyway?

29:02.700 --> 29:03.659
We, uh...

29:03.701 --> 29:06.245
To be honest,

29:06.286 --> 29:08.955
she was talking me through
a bad breakup.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.749
Wow, somebody must have
really pissed you off.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.043
Yeah, he did.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.839
Yeah, I been there.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.676
Look, I gotta
get back to the bus.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.888
Maybe you can
make it up to me

29:24.930 --> 29:26.806
with a free tennis
lesson sometime.

29:34.523 --> 29:35.899
Give me a call.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.070
(laughs)

29:40.112 --> 29:41.905
Did he just hit
on me?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.699
What did I tell you?

29:43.741 --> 29:46.201
Good things are gonna start
happening to Teddy.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.789
(laughs)

29:52.999 --> 29:56.462
You know, birdwatchers

29:56.503 --> 29:59.798
spend years without
ever getting

29:59.839 --> 30:00.840
a burrowing owl sighting.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.801
Or getting laid.

30:02.842 --> 30:06.430
Maybe we should give up.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.847
You know what, Max?

30:07.889 --> 30:09.141
I'm a lot of things:

30:09.182 --> 30:12.478
a airhead, a clotheshorse,
occasional bitch,

30:12.519 --> 30:15.481
but I am not a quitter.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.941
(grunts)

30:21.695 --> 30:26.617
"Cecily, ever since I looked
upon your wonderful

30:26.659 --> 30:27.909
"and incomparable beauty,

30:27.951 --> 30:32.038
"I have dared to love you
wildly, passionately,

30:32.080 --> 30:33.582
devotedly, hopelessly."

30:33.624 --> 30:36.460
I don't think that you should
tell me that you love me wildly,

30:36.502 --> 30:39.838
passionately, devotedly,
hopelessly.

30:39.879 --> 30:44.593
Hopelessly doesn't seem
to make much sense, does it?

30:44.635 --> 30:46.428
Um, Emily, what...

30:46.470 --> 30:48.430
Oh, it's just part of the scene.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.476
Uncle Jack would be
very much annoyed

30:52.518 --> 30:54.894
if he knew you were
staying on until next week

30:54.936 --> 30:56.563
at the same hour.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.316
"Oh, I don't care
about Jack.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.611
"I don't care for anybody in
the whole world but you.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.697
I lo... I..."

31:04.738 --> 31:07.658
Okay, um...

31:07.700 --> 31:09.493
"I love you, Cecily.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.705
Will you... you will
marry me, won't you?"

31:12.746 --> 31:16.916
I had to stop at three different
SnoYos just to find...

31:16.958 --> 31:18.001
What the hell is this?!

31:18.043 --> 31:20.838
Hey. I was just, uh,
helping Emily run lines.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.172
Huh! I know what
she was doing,

31:22.214 --> 31:23.965
and it has nothing to do
with running lines.

31:24.007 --> 31:24.966
Get away from him!

31:25.008 --> 31:26.343
No, it's not like that.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.178
It is like that!
Don't you see it?

31:28.220 --> 31:31.097
She won't stop until she
destroys my entire life!

31:32.891 --> 31:36.603
Don't, okay?
Just spare me the tears!

31:36.645 --> 31:37.813
(crying softly)

31:37.855 --> 31:39.356
It's okay.
Annie, take it easy.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.357
Liam!

31:40.399 --> 31:41.441
Calm down!

31:41.483 --> 31:43.109
(scoffs)
Fine.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.570
You know what?

31:44.611 --> 31:46.405
You two enjoy yourselves!

31:52.285 --> 31:53.412

Whoo!

32:47.424 --> 32:48.926
Vaughn hates me.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.596
Yeah, well, at least we
made it through the day, huh?

32:52.638 --> 32:53.597
No thanks to Adrianna.

32:53.639 --> 32:54.973
These guys think we're a joke.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.433
NAVID:
Hey, great job, Nelly.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.059
Yeah, love
the new song, man.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.394
The video's
gonna be hot.

32:59.436 --> 33:00.687
Thanks, man.
Appreciate that.

33:00.729 --> 33:01.855
I had fun, a'ight?

33:01.897 --> 33:03.899
And yo, props on
the candy corn, yo.

33:03.941 --> 33:04.900
NAVID:
What?

33:04.942 --> 33:06.151
Candy corn--
I love 'em.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.486
It's just hard to get
past Halloween, you know?

33:07.527 --> 33:09.529
You don't mind if I take
this with me, huh?

33:09.571 --> 33:10.572
Please, be my guest.

33:10.614 --> 33:11.824
Hey, yo, Vaughn,

33:11.865 --> 33:13.158
this space is ill, yo.

33:13.199 --> 33:15.034
We'll shoot here
again, won't we?

33:15.076 --> 33:16.578
Of course.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.205
Yo, take it easy.

33:20.582 --> 33:21.708
Bye.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.085
Later, Nelly.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.879
That's my boy.

33:25.921 --> 33:29.007
Well, looks like you pulled
this one out of your ass.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.509
First rule
in this business--

33:30.550 --> 33:32.970
keep the artist happy.
I'll be in touch.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.556
Keep the artist happy.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.392
Dude likes candy corn.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.144
Dude... likes
candy corn.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.232
Can you believe it?!

33:46.274 --> 33:49.402
MAX:
It's pretty dark.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.196
Yeah.

33:51.237 --> 33:55.951
Might be hard to find
this bird, seeing as

33:55.993 --> 33:59.245
we, unlike owls,
cannot see in the dark.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.331
I know.
(owl hooting)

34:01.373 --> 34:03.249
Wait, that's it.
That's their call.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.877
Really?
Yeah.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.753
Look, look...

34:06.795 --> 34:08.797
What?
Oh my God, there it is.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.433
Once they see our findings,

34:20.475 --> 34:22.351
the city planning office
will issue a delay,

34:22.393 --> 34:24.688
pending a full environmental
impact report.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.772
But substantial evidence
already shows

34:25.813 --> 34:27.482
that building
on this land

34:27.524 --> 34:29.609
will have a devastating impact
on the habitat of this...

34:29.650 --> 34:33.947
This cute, adorable,
little burrowing owl.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.239
(sighs deeply)

34:35.281 --> 34:36.366
Any questions?

34:40.245 --> 34:43.040
I don't believe this.
An owl?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.625
MAN:
You can't get caught
in the middle

34:45.667 --> 34:48.628
of an environmental firestorm--
the PR damage alone.

34:48.670 --> 34:49.838
(sighs deeply)

34:49.880 --> 34:51.130
Fine.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.882
End it.

34:52.925 --> 34:56.302
We won't protest the
cancellation of the land sale.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.895
Take me to In 'N' Out.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.229
I need red meat.

35:08.982 --> 35:11.568
Congratulations.
Thank you.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.154
Oh my God,
we did it!

35:15.196 --> 35:16.907
You did the science...

35:16.949 --> 35:18.157
And you did the presentation.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.660
Nice pizzazz,
by the way.

35:20.702 --> 35:21.787
Thank you.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.338
(door closes)

35:36.259 --> 35:37.677
Hey.

35:37.719 --> 35:39.137
Hey!

35:39.178 --> 35:40.680
How was school today?

35:40.722 --> 35:43.141
It was, uh, pretty good.

35:43.182 --> 35:45.268
Oh, uh, I forgot.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.686
I got you something.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.354
A little something.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.857
What's this? A gift?

35:50.899 --> 35:51.900
Yeah, open it.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.278
Thank you.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.698
Ten dollars?

35:58.740 --> 36:01.242
Well, when you subtract
our expenses

36:01.284 --> 36:04.162
that's what we made
on the video shoot yesterday.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.873
I know
it's not much, but...

36:06.915 --> 36:08.625
it's honest money.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.130
Shirazi 2.0, Mom.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.549
Shirazi 2.0.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.682
It's going to be okay.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.267
I'm so proud of you.

36:28.937 --> 36:32.482
All right...
you just sign here

36:32.524 --> 36:34.484
and you'll have
your money back.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.656
You seem rather subdued

36:39.698 --> 36:42.283
for someone who's
$200,000 richer.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.119
Are you okay?

36:47.455 --> 36:49.041
No, I'm not.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.711
I'm happy to have
my money back,

36:52.752 --> 36:54.462
but now I have
a bigger problem.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.590
I think I have
the hots for a nerd.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.059
Annie.

37:07.100 --> 37:11.063
I am so sorry about
what happened with Liam.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.939
The whole thing was
really innocent.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.151
Nothing about you
is innocent, Emily.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.361
If you think you're going
to steal my boyfriend,

37:18.403 --> 37:19.571
it's not going to happen.

37:19.612 --> 37:24.743
Ugh, and spare me
the tears, Emily,

37:24.784 --> 37:27.453
'cause I'm not buying it.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.040
Fine. Cards up.

37:30.082 --> 37:33.334
All my life, I've
looked up to you.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.462
And when I moved here,
all I wanted was to
be friends with you.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.215
But you wouldn't
let me in.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.926
You looked down on me,
you ignored me

37:40.967 --> 37:44.012
and you basically told
Dixon and Aunt Deb
that I was a stalker.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.723
Yeah, I heard that.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.391
And now the tables have turned.

37:48.433 --> 37:51.519
So who wants
to Single White Female who?

37:53.230 --> 37:55.440
People are going
to find out

37:55.481 --> 37:58.401
what a psychotic, manipulative,
crazy bitch you are,

37:58.443 --> 38:00.528
'cause I'm going
to tell them.

38:00.570 --> 38:01.780
Go ahead.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.407
Who do you think
they're going to believe--

38:04.449 --> 38:07.911
you or innocent
little Emily?

38:09.495 --> 38:11.289
(sobbing)

38:11.330 --> 38:14.126
Please, Annie, all I want

38:14.167 --> 38:15.877
is to be friends with you.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.882
Good night.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.304
(knocking on door)

38:26.345 --> 38:28.098
Ade.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.476
Hey, I got your text.

38:31.517 --> 38:33.812
What's going on?

38:33.853 --> 38:36.022
Navid admitted it.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.859
He told me he cheated on me.

38:41.694 --> 38:42.862
That's...

38:45.698 --> 38:47.284
I can't believe it.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.119
Um...

38:49.161 --> 38:51.454
Did he say who it was?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.041
No.

39:01.547 --> 39:04.509
I guess this doesn't belong
to his sister.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.723
Ade...

39:12.725 --> 39:16.354
...maybe it's time that you try
to move on from Navid.

39:16.395 --> 39:20.192
Take control of
your own happiness.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.943
Yeah.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.779
You're right.

39:24.821 --> 39:27.199
You know what would make
me really happy?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.577
Getting revenge on the skank
he cheated with.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.041
That's why
I'm going to find out

39:36.082 --> 39:40.170
who this belongs to
and I'm going to destroy her.
