00:08.708 --> 00:11.576
Merry christmas.
It's yule time
here on <i>tool time.</i>

00:11.577 --> 00:13.311
Merry christmas.

00:13.312 --> 00:18.016
You know, christmas
always reminds me
of my childhood.

00:18.017 --> 00:20.351
I used to build
a snowman every year.

00:20.352 --> 00:23.021
I used a carrot
for its nose,

00:23.022 --> 00:26.891
Cookies for its eyes,
licorice for its smile.

00:26.892 --> 00:28.292
Ah, that's a great story, al.

00:28.293 --> 00:31.062
Unfortunately, al's mom
usually ate the snowman.

00:34.867 --> 00:36.968
One year.

00:40.106 --> 00:43.708
She used the carrot
to make coleslaw.

00:43.709 --> 00:47.145
Today's <i>tool time</i> isn't about
a plaid lad's christmas.

00:47.146 --> 00:50.515
Today's <i>tool time</i>
is about a man's christmas.

00:50.516 --> 00:52.717
And nothing says
christmas to a man

00:52.718 --> 00:57.088
Like a block of ice
and a binford chainsaw.

00:57.089 --> 00:59.758
That's right. And today's
special <i>tool time</i> guest

00:59.759 --> 01:02.694
Uses a chainsaw to make
beautiful ice sculptures.

01:02.695 --> 01:06.397
That's right. Our guest,
chas jensen, is here

01:06.398 --> 01:09.901
For the plymouth international
ice sculpting spectacular.

01:09.902 --> 01:13.437
So let's give him a warm...
Wait. Let's give him a cool
<i>tool time</i> welcome -

01:13.438 --> 01:15.239
Chas jensen!

01:19.111 --> 01:21.146
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
Thank you, tim.

01:21.147 --> 01:22.547
Chas.
Thank you, al.

01:22.548 --> 01:24.916
Now, rumor has it
that you can actually make

01:24.917 --> 01:27.686
A christmas tree
out of this block of ice
in 30 seconds.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.287
Yes, I can. Would you
like me to demonstrate?

01:29.288 --> 01:31.823
We didn't invite you
on the show to sing.

01:31.824 --> 01:33.058
Ok.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.862
Whoo!

01:58.383 --> 02:00.418
<i>(applause)</i>

02:03.723 --> 02:05.256
You know,
that is fabulous.

02:05.257 --> 02:09.860
However, the presents
you put under it
should be waterproof.

03:05.751 --> 03:10.955
Oh, no. It's the christmas
lighting contest again.

03:10.956 --> 03:13.291
Tim, I hope you're not gonna
go overboard this year.

03:13.292 --> 03:16.094
You know, we could try a little
subtlety for a change.

03:16.095 --> 03:18.863
Got it covered.

03:18.864 --> 03:22.133
Oh, tim!

03:22.134 --> 03:25.736
They were all
out of the big ones.
Right.

03:25.737 --> 03:27.571
Hey, no running
in the house.

03:27.572 --> 03:30.508
Mom, I have to go
to the bathroom!

03:30.509 --> 03:34.179
Hey, hurry up, mark.
Get outta there.
I gotta go really bad.

03:34.180 --> 03:35.713
Why don't you go upstairs
and use your bathroom?

03:35.714 --> 03:38.783
I can't. Aunt nancy's in there
giving the babies a bath.

03:38.784 --> 03:40.852
Well, then use ours.
Uncle marty's in there,

03:40.853 --> 03:44.055
And he took five magazines
with him.

03:45.757 --> 03:49.260
Go get some of those
stick matches. Whoo!

03:49.261 --> 03:50.628
I'm out.

03:50.629 --> 03:53.397
Tim?

03:53.398 --> 03:56.034
Will you please set
the highchair up for lunch?

03:56.035 --> 03:58.937
I'll just eat
at the counter.

03:58.938 --> 04:03.942
Oh, it's so great to have
babies in the house again.

04:03.943 --> 04:07.812
Yeah. There's nothing like
a little projectile vomit
to brighten up the holidays.

04:07.813 --> 04:09.981
Oh, come on.

04:09.982 --> 04:13.918
Gosh, I think this is going
to be the perfect christmas.

04:13.919 --> 04:15.920
You're not kidding.
I think this year,

04:15.921 --> 04:18.422
Finally my decorations
are gonna beat doc johnson.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.259
No. I was referring to your
brother's family being here,

04:21.260 --> 04:23.328
And my parents coming.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.264
Don't set yourself up like this.
Every year your parents come,

04:26.265 --> 04:31.502
You end up locked
in your bedroom going,
"why did I even invite them?"

04:34.340 --> 04:36.440
Know what present I'd like
your dad to give me?

04:36.441 --> 04:39.911
Call me my name "tim"
instead of "hey, you."

04:39.912 --> 04:42.780
Well, if you heard what he
called you behind your back,

04:42.781 --> 04:46.550
You'd be happy
with "hey, you."

04:46.551 --> 04:48.286
<i>(doorbell)</i>
oh, they're here.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.328
Mom, it's so wonderful
to see you!

04:57.329 --> 04:59.463
It's amazing
you're seeing us at all.

04:59.464 --> 05:02.066
Your father didn't use
the turn signal once,

05:02.067 --> 05:03.701
All the way from texas.

05:03.702 --> 05:06.337
Hello, dear.
Hello, tim.
Hi, lillian.

05:06.338 --> 05:09.740
I didn't use the signal
because there was no one
behind me, lillian.

05:09.741 --> 05:12.877
Then what was that truck
that almost sideswiped us?

05:12.878 --> 05:16.047
He had no business
being on the interstate,
big truck like that.

05:16.048 --> 05:19.784
Hi, daddy.
Hello, sweetheart.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.286
Hey, you.

05:23.522 --> 05:26.490
Grandpa, grandma!
Here come the crew!

05:28.427 --> 05:31.562
Hello!
Give me some sugar.
Grandma.

05:31.563 --> 05:34.065
All right, men.
Here's your mission.

05:34.066 --> 05:37.168
There is a vehicle
in the driveway
that needs unloading.

05:37.169 --> 05:39.003
Dismissed.

05:39.004 --> 05:42.673
It's packed to the ceiling
with presents.
Charge!

05:42.674 --> 05:45.543
That's another thing.
Your father piled the presents
up so high in the back seat,

05:45.544 --> 05:47.678
He couldn't even
see out the window.

05:47.679 --> 05:49.380
Don't blame me.

05:49.381 --> 05:54.618
I wanted to put the presents
in the front seat
and you in the back.

05:54.619 --> 05:58.156
Well, that would've
certainly made things
more pleasant for me.

05:58.157 --> 06:01.960
Oh, it's gonna be
a perfect christmas.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.429
Would anybody like
some eggnog?

06:04.430 --> 06:06.564
Oh, no. Your father
can't eat eggs.

06:06.565 --> 06:11.535
I can eat eggs. I just don't
know what the hell "nog" is.

06:11.536 --> 06:15.340
Oh, look! You remember
tim's brother, marty,
and his wife, nancy.

06:15.341 --> 06:18.209
And this is claire,
and I think that's gracie.

06:18.210 --> 06:21.412
Oh, aren't they
little angels?

06:21.413 --> 06:23.781
Yeah, take a good look.
They're clean.

06:23.782 --> 06:27.151
We're clean.
It only happens once a day.

06:27.152 --> 06:30.455
If you're thinking about
a career, think army.

06:30.456 --> 06:34.125
All he ever talks about
is the army, the army, the army.

06:34.126 --> 06:36.995
You'd think he'd
never retired.
Never should've retired.

06:36.996 --> 06:42.867
After spending two days
in a car with you,
the korean war was a picnic.

06:42.868 --> 06:46.237
Well, I really enjoyed
my two days riding with you.

06:46.238 --> 06:48.873
Of course, I could've had more
scintillating conversation

06:48.874 --> 06:53.644
With a crash dummy.
You calling me a dummy?

06:53.645 --> 06:55.480
Would you please
just stop...
Jill?

06:55.481 --> 07:00.218
...Standing there, so we can
talk about christmas lights?

07:00.219 --> 07:02.753
Tim is entering a contest.
Tell them, honey.

07:02.754 --> 07:05.223
I'm entering a contest.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.261
Hey, guys, get down here.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.997
Let's see what
grandma and grandpa
got us for christmas.

07:12.998 --> 07:16.334
Hear anything good?
No, I don't hear anything.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.736
<i>(both)</i> clothes.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.542
Oh, there they go.

07:24.543 --> 07:26.911
Don't stay out too long, boys.
When you get back,

07:26.912 --> 07:29.947
You can help me put the icing
on my famous sticky buns.

07:29.948 --> 07:31.482
All right, grandma. Bye!

07:34.119 --> 07:38.956
Now, don't worry, jill.
You can go back on
your diet after christmas.

07:38.957 --> 07:41.292
I'm not on a diet, mom.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.928
Oh! Oh, oh, well.

07:43.929 --> 07:47.465
Then you don't have
to worry at all.

07:47.466 --> 07:51.135
So, are you and dad ok
in brad's room?

07:51.136 --> 07:53.871
Oh, as ok as we are
anywhere else.

07:53.872 --> 07:57.375
You have no idea what your
father's like these days.

07:57.376 --> 07:59.544
Right. I'll grease
those baking pans...

07:59.545 --> 08:03.481
Ever since he retired,
he just sits like a lump
in his den

08:03.482 --> 08:07.251
And watches the same old war
movie over and over and over.

08:07.252 --> 08:10.455
Margarine or butter?
<i>Patton.</i>

08:12.224 --> 08:16.461
He's seen it so many times,
I know everything that
george s. Patton ever said.

08:16.462 --> 08:20.164
"ok, men. We're going
through those enemy lines

08:20.165 --> 08:22.933
Like crap through a goose."

08:24.970 --> 08:27.004
Oh, about these
sticky buns...

08:27.005 --> 08:29.640
And I can't get him
to do anything.

08:29.641 --> 08:33.410
I thought we'd get to travel
and go to Italy,

08:33.412 --> 08:37.615
Do all the things
we never had time to do
when he was working.

08:37.616 --> 08:40.183
Just when I thought we'd be
getting closer together,

08:40.184 --> 08:42.653
We seem to be growing apart.

08:44.222 --> 08:48.892
Mom, don't you think
you ought to talk to dad
about this, not me?

08:48.893 --> 08:52.696
Well, it's no use.
He's established
a stronghold in that den.

08:52.697 --> 08:57.801
I'd have to put a grenade
under his barcalounger
to get him out of there.

08:57.802 --> 09:00.871
<i>(colonel shouts)</i> lillian!
Where'd you put my tape
of <i>patton?</i>

09:00.872 --> 09:03.541
I want to show it to the boys
when they get back.

09:03.542 --> 09:06.710
I threw it out of the window
in st. Louis.

09:06.711 --> 09:09.647
If you're serious, we're
going back to get it!

09:10.682 --> 09:14.018
All right, all right.
I'll find it.

09:19.724 --> 09:21.992
Tim, tim, wait a second.
I want to talk to you.

09:21.993 --> 09:25.563
Not now. I gotta go
light up a camel.

09:25.564 --> 09:28.633
I talked with my mother.
She's really upset with dad.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.501
I know that I said
that I wouldn't get involved,

09:30.502 --> 09:33.137
But I really think I have
to say something to my father.

09:33.138 --> 09:36.240
Before you say something,
let me say something.
Don't say something.

09:36.241 --> 09:38.108
This is not
their usual bickering.

09:38.109 --> 09:40.077
It seems like
they're really unhappy.

09:40.078 --> 09:43.614
Well, of course they are.
They've been married 42 years!

09:47.319 --> 09:50.188
<i>(martial music</i>
<i>and gunfire on tv)</i>

10:00.332 --> 10:04.535
Look, girls. There's
general george s. Patton.

10:04.536 --> 10:08.472
He was the most powerful
military leader in the world.

10:11.276 --> 10:14.078
Phew!
Speaking of powerful.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.983
I think one of those babies
just dropped a bomb.

10:22.787 --> 10:25.122
There they are.

10:25.123 --> 10:28.125
Oh, they were crying,
so I decided to calm 'em down

10:28.126 --> 10:32.263
By letting 'em watch patton's
invasion of north africa.

10:32.264 --> 10:37.468
At home, we just put them
to sleep with old tapes
of <i>tool time.</i>

10:37.469 --> 10:41.272
Whoa! Somebody's stinking up
the joint over here.

10:41.273 --> 10:45.243
Randy!

10:45.244 --> 10:47.511
Boys? Boys, would you go
upstairs for a while?

10:47.512 --> 10:49.513
I want to talk
to grandpa alone.

10:49.514 --> 10:51.482
Mom, we're right in
the middle of <i>patton.</i>

10:51.483 --> 10:55.853
Well, go upstairs
and ask your grandma to act out
the rest of it for you.

10:55.854 --> 11:00.258
Hey, brad, will you take
claire up to nancy? Here.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.025
Bye-bye.

11:04.229 --> 11:07.465
What are you doing? I was
watching my favorite movie.

11:07.466 --> 11:10.301
Yeah, I hear that's what
you spend most of your time
doing now,

11:10.302 --> 11:11.736
Watching old war movies.

11:11.737 --> 11:15.939
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Your mother been talking to you?

11:15.940 --> 11:19.877
Dad, it's not uncommon when
a man retires to go through
something like this.

11:19.878 --> 11:21.712
Something like what?

11:21.713 --> 11:25.516
Well, I think that
you're experiencing a
little bout of depression.

11:25.517 --> 11:28.085
You know,
this is just like you.

11:28.086 --> 11:30.087
The second we walk
through the door,

11:30.088 --> 11:32.590
You stick your nose
in the middle our business.

11:32.591 --> 11:35.293
Now wait a second. I've been
trying to stay out of this.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.795
The second you walked
through the door,
you two started arguing.

11:37.796 --> 11:40.498
That's not true.
We started arguing in texas!

11:42.467 --> 11:46.003
Well, it's 2,000 miles.
You could have finished
by missouri.

11:51.376 --> 11:55.879
Doc johnson's amazing.
I swear his santa looks real.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.882
Just put the binoculars down.
Give me a hand with
the virgin mary, will you?

12:00.919 --> 12:04.154
I'm sorry, marty.
Are you all right?

12:04.155 --> 12:08.892
I don't know. I'm still numb
from when you beaned me
with the pig.

12:08.893 --> 12:11.729
Tim, can you come down here?
I need to talk to you.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.631
Can't it wait?
No.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.834
Aw! Marty, I'll be right back.

12:16.835 --> 12:18.869
I really blew it
this time.

12:18.870 --> 12:22.406
I tried to talk to dad about mom
and now he is really mad at me.

12:22.407 --> 12:25.075
I thought we decided that you
weren't gonna get involved.

12:25.076 --> 12:27.345
Young lady? Could I see you
for a minute, please?

12:27.346 --> 12:29.313
I am so mad at you.

12:29.314 --> 12:31.315
Great. Now they're
both mad at me.

12:31.316 --> 12:33.718
Congratulations!
Two for two.

12:37.522 --> 12:40.391
Did you tell your father
that I said he was depressing?

12:40.392 --> 12:43.193
No. I didn't say
he was depressing.
I said he was depressed.

12:43.194 --> 12:45.963
He said that you said
that I said he was depressing.

12:45.964 --> 12:49.767
No, no. I said that he was
exhibiting all the classic
signs of depression.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.102
I don't think that
one semester of psychology

12:52.103 --> 12:55.038
Qualifies you to diagnose
retired colonels.

12:55.039 --> 12:57.708
Mom, I was just trying to help
you get through to him.

12:57.709 --> 13:00.244
Well, I don't need you
to help me get through
to my own husband.

13:00.245 --> 13:02.813
Well, then why did you come
to me complaining about him
in the first place?

13:02.814 --> 13:06.016
I was just letting off steam.
If you hadn't opened your mouth,

13:06.017 --> 13:08.285
Your father and I could've
just been mad at each other

13:08.286 --> 13:10.954
And had a perfectly
lovely christmas.

13:13.091 --> 13:17.495
Band-aids?
Um, upstairs,
top three drawers.

13:17.496 --> 13:21.265
Which room?
Every room.

13:25.303 --> 13:29.239
Tim? Can you come down here?
I have to talk to you.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.041
Again?
Yeah.

13:31.042 --> 13:33.677
Oh, come on!

13:37.081 --> 13:40.050
Ok, what did you do now?
Hi-de-ho, neighbors.

13:40.051 --> 13:42.420
Never mind. I'll talk
to wilson instead.

13:44.055 --> 13:46.457
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna install an escalator.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.526
Wilson, I'm really
having a problem.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.896
Uh-oh. Experiencing
a little seasonal stress,
jill?

13:51.897 --> 13:55.566
Yeah. My dad is having trouble
adjusting to retirement,

13:55.567 --> 13:58.736
It's driving my mother crazy,
so I tried to help,
and now they're both mad at me.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.338
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
You got caught in the middle.

14:01.339 --> 14:04.475
That is a familial landmine,
not to mention a noel no-no.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.010
Yeah.

14:07.011 --> 14:09.680
Course, tim told me
not to get involved...

14:09.681 --> 14:11.214
Yes, I did!

14:11.215 --> 14:15.018
But is it really such
a bad thing for me to
try to help my parents?

14:15.019 --> 14:18.221
Yes, it was.
Shut up, tim!

14:18.222 --> 14:20.558
Well, jill, when parents
are having problems,

14:20.559 --> 14:24.094
It's natural for a child,
regardless of age,
to want to help.

14:24.095 --> 14:26.497
Did you hear that, tim?
On the other hand,

14:26.498 --> 14:29.433
It's perfectly natural
for parents to not want
their children's help.

14:29.434 --> 14:32.736
You hear that, jill?

14:32.737 --> 14:36.474
Wilson, what are you saying?
What am I supposed to do
about my parents?

14:36.475 --> 14:40.277
Well, I can tell you what they
do in the nuer tribe in africa.

14:40.278 --> 14:44.482
They bring in
a wise member of the tribe,
usually an older nuer,

14:44.483 --> 14:46.484
Who helps counsels
the disputing parties

14:46.485 --> 14:48.486
And helps them resolve
their differences.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.455
So what I need
is an objective third party?

14:51.456 --> 14:54.592
Exactly.
Wilson, please!

14:56.127 --> 14:57.895
No, jill.
I would love to,

14:57.896 --> 15:00.030
But I'm going to
a filipino christmas party.

15:00.031 --> 15:01.632
When are you gonna be back?
Couple of weeks.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.434
The party's
in the philippines.

15:04.435 --> 15:09.540
Man! Well, there goes my fantasy
of a perfect christmas.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.676
Thanks anyway, wilson.
Have a nice trip.

15:12.677 --> 15:16.046
How about you, tim?
I think you would qualify
as an objective third party.

15:16.047 --> 15:19.349
Forget about it, wilson.
I'm the kind of guy
that likes to stand his ground.

15:19.350 --> 15:20.718
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

15:20.719 --> 15:22.953
Ow! Ow! Ow!

15:26.157 --> 15:27.591
Are you all right?

15:27.592 --> 15:30.528
Oh, yeah. Oh...

15:30.529 --> 15:33.597
Yeah, I just was tired
of using that ladder.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.906
So, what did you get me
for christmas?

15:41.907 --> 15:43.340
Why?

15:43.341 --> 15:46.577
'cause I want to know if I got
you the same thing you got me.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.913
I didn't get you anything.

15:48.914 --> 15:52.049
Same thing I got you.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.852
Those sticky buns
are for breakfast tomorrow.

15:54.853 --> 15:57.287
You guys aren't
sneaking any, are you?

15:57.288 --> 15:58.722
No.

15:58.723 --> 16:00.891
Why not?
Nobody's looking.

16:04.629 --> 16:07.130
Hey, colonel.
Hey, you.

16:10.501 --> 16:14.471
What are you doing?
I'm watching <i>patton.</i>

16:14.472 --> 16:16.073
How about putting
that thing on pause

16:16.074 --> 16:18.709
And helping me string these
lights up on the roof there?

16:18.710 --> 16:24.448
I have no interest
in your battle with
an 80-year-old proctologist.

16:24.449 --> 16:28.052
Yeah, you're right.
Guy's probably gonna win anyway.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.988
You know how tough
those old navy guys are.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.329
Did you say "navy"?
<i>(grunting)</i> yes, I did.

16:42.300 --> 16:45.035
No way we're gonna
let a navy guy beat us.

16:45.036 --> 16:48.105
All right, colonel.
With your help, I think
we can beat the old doctor.

16:48.106 --> 16:50.440
Now, let me see the enemy.
Watch your step.

16:50.441 --> 16:52.977
Across the street there,
red brick, white trim.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.912
He's walking
on the roof there.

16:54.913 --> 16:58.616
He's got so many things
up there, I can't see
which one is doc johnson.

16:58.617 --> 17:00.951
He's the one wearing
the rubber gloves.

17:04.555 --> 17:06.624
All right, we got
a lot of work to do. Um...

17:06.625 --> 17:09.291
All right,
hand me the sheep,
you plug in the pig.

17:09.292 --> 17:11.560
Ok.

17:11.561 --> 17:13.998
There you go.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.900
Colonel, it's great
to have you on my team.

17:16.901 --> 17:19.970
It's great to be back
in action again.

17:19.971 --> 17:24.307
From what jill says,
you haven't been
too active lately, though.

17:24.308 --> 17:26.343
Yeah, here we go.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.779
Now there's another monkey
in the middle.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.648
I'm not a monkey
in the middle.

17:30.649 --> 17:35.452
I'm an objective third party,
like the african manure tribe.

17:35.453 --> 17:38.756
What the hell are
you talking about?

17:38.757 --> 17:41.191
Jill says you've been spending
a lot of time in the den,

17:41.192 --> 17:42.893
And lillian's not happy
about it.

17:42.894 --> 17:47.798
Lillian doesn't understand
how my life has changed.

17:47.799 --> 17:51.635
I used to command
2,000 troops

17:51.636 --> 17:54.104
Who worshipped the ground
I walked on.

17:54.105 --> 17:57.407
Now I spend all my time
with one woman

17:57.408 --> 18:00.410
Who vacuums the ground
I walk on.

18:02.647 --> 18:05.348
Just 'cause you're retired
from the army doesn't mean
you're retired from life.

18:05.349 --> 18:07.685
I'm not retiring from life.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.920
You're retreating
from your marriage.

18:09.921 --> 18:12.422
An army man never retreats.

18:12.423 --> 18:14.257
What are you doing
in the den all the time?

18:14.258 --> 18:19.063
I'm watching the story
of the greatest military hero
of all time.

18:19.064 --> 18:22.566
How many scenes in that film
do you see patton in his den,

18:22.567 --> 18:24.634
Sitting on his butt,
looking for his remote?

18:31.876 --> 18:36.346
Lillian? What are you doing
up at 0600 hours?

18:36.347 --> 18:38.481
Well, I've been up
all night.

18:38.482 --> 18:41.451
Who could sleep with the two
of you stomping on the roof?

18:41.452 --> 18:43.453
Oh, it was worth it.

18:43.454 --> 18:47.424
We're gonna surprise the hell
out of that navy butt doctor.

18:50.528 --> 18:53.630
Well, you must be exhausted.
You never came to bed.

18:53.631 --> 18:56.767
I was so excited,
I didn't even think
about the time.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.770
Did think of some
other stuff, though.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.606
Like getting off my butt
and out of the den.

19:02.607 --> 19:05.943
Where you gonna go?
The living room?

19:05.944 --> 19:07.677
No.

19:07.678 --> 19:13.150
I realize I haven't been
much fun to live with
since I retired.

19:13.151 --> 19:17.821
What would you think about
doing a little traveling?

19:17.822 --> 19:20.557
Maybe going to Italy.

19:23.194 --> 19:26.663
Well, I've always wanted to go
to Italy. Especially venice.

19:26.664 --> 19:29.233
Well, I'd like to take you.

19:33.571 --> 19:36.373
Oh, you would, huh?
Yeah. We could...

19:36.374 --> 19:40.077
We could, you know,
see the sights.
Eat some pasta.

19:40.078 --> 19:43.613
Maybe go on a gondola ride.

19:43.614 --> 19:45.715
I thought you hated boats.

19:45.716 --> 19:48.919
A gondola's a boat?
Oh, fred!

19:56.627 --> 19:59.329
Merry christmas.

19:59.330 --> 20:02.132
I don't know what
happened last night,

20:02.133 --> 20:07.171
But when we get back home,
maybe you'd better spend
more time on the roof.

20:10.141 --> 20:14.611
Jill? What are you
doing there?

20:14.612 --> 20:16.646
Have you been
eavesdropping on us?

20:16.647 --> 20:18.648
No, I'm sleepwalking.

20:18.649 --> 20:20.684
You make coffee
when you're sleepwalking?

20:20.685 --> 20:24.621
Yes. That way it's ready
when I wake up.

20:24.622 --> 20:26.723
Ooh, we should have
some of these.

20:26.724 --> 20:30.093
Oh, who got
into my sticky buns?
They're half gone.

20:30.094 --> 20:32.729
The boys must have.

20:34.899 --> 20:38.135
Those little scamps.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.503
Daddy, I'm so happy.

20:40.504 --> 20:42.772
Looks like we're gonna have
that perfect christmas
after all.

20:42.773 --> 20:46.043
You bet.
I didn't think that you
were listening to me,

20:46.044 --> 20:48.378
But it seems like
some of what I said sunk in.

20:48.379 --> 20:52.482
It wasn't you.
It was "hey, you."

20:52.483 --> 20:54.751
Tim?

20:54.752 --> 20:57.821
You know, if you listen
to what he has to say,

20:57.822 --> 20:59.823
He's not such an idiot.

21:00.992 --> 21:04.094
<i>(tim yelling)</i>
whoa! Help me out!

21:06.597 --> 21:08.999
Colonel! Colonel!

21:09.000 --> 21:11.801
I need a little help out here.
Colonel!

21:17.441 --> 21:20.510
Come on, they're coming
down the block. The judges
are ready to look at the house.

21:20.511 --> 21:22.846
Let's go see it.

21:22.847 --> 21:25.749
All I'm missing
is a real baby
for the manger.

21:28.719 --> 21:30.720
He wouldn't really.

21:30.721 --> 21:32.756
He would, but we're
not gonna let him.

21:32.757 --> 21:35.259
It's not like you
don't have one to spare.

21:37.461 --> 21:40.663
<i>(lillian)</i> this is what you
spent all night on?

21:40.664 --> 21:42.332
<i>(jill)</i> I don't even
see a manger.

21:42.333 --> 21:45.235
They didn't see the allies
coming into normandy either.

21:45.236 --> 21:47.404
And you know why?
<i>(lillian)</i> why?

21:47.405 --> 21:50.107
Camouflage!

21:50.108 --> 21:51.375
Watch.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.985
<i>(jill)</i> beautiful!

22:01.986 --> 22:04.955
But you know what?
I still don't see a manger.

22:04.956 --> 22:06.957
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

22:09.660 --> 22:12.963
<i>(jill)</i> wow!
Oh, that is so cool!

22:12.964 --> 22:15.198
Look, it just raises up
right out of...

22:15.199 --> 22:18.568
Tim, did you make a hole
in our roof?
Oh, yeah.

22:18.569 --> 22:20.770
Just a little one.
I'll repair it to--

22:20.771 --> 22:22.940
Tomorrow...
Oh, no!

22:22.941 --> 22:25.175
Uh-oh.

22:31.950 --> 22:35.452
Well, you know, I always
wondered what I would
look like frozen.

22:35.453 --> 22:38.688
Just look in the mirror, al.

22:38.689 --> 22:40.757
But actually, his belt's
a little wide.

22:40.758 --> 22:42.759
Let me just take a little bit
out of that waist here for you.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.295
Tim, do not touch
frozen al.

22:45.296 --> 22:47.530
I know what I'm doing, al.

22:47.531 --> 22:51.168
Oh, great! Now you've taken
a chunk out of frozen al.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.437
Sorry. Don't worry
about it, buddy.
