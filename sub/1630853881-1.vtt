00:45.178 --> 00:47.347
[whispers] Fuck me now.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.117
Nothing in life is free,

but if you're willing to pay,

00:55.957 --> 00:57.659
well, then I promise you,

00:58.660 --> 01:02.095
it'll be the best money

02:12.634 --> 02:14.769
I wish to thank you

She means everything

And he's gone. [sighs]

02:50.538 --> 02:52.272
And I'm talking
to an empty room.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.842
[chuckles]
I'm still doing it.

02:56.077 --> 02:58.445
Your wife is ready
to go home.

03:11.626 --> 03:14.461
Her vitals,
brain activity and battery
have all been charged

03:14.595 --> 03:17.397
and are ready
for Companionship.

03:17.532 --> 03:19.366
We've uploaded
all of her information

03:19.499 --> 03:21.636
and reviewed
all her settings.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.204
She's perfect.

[rain pattering]

03:34.148 --> 03:35.215
Hi.

03:35.348 --> 03:36.918
Hi! Can I have
a minute of your time?

03:37.051 --> 03:39.053
Literally, a minute
that will change the world.

03:39.187 --> 03:40.655
[chuckles]

03:40.788 --> 03:43.758
We don't change the world.
It changes us.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.359
I beg to differ.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.895
Would you sign our petition?

03:48.029 --> 03:50.397
We believe that love is real,
it's not artificial,

03:50.531 --> 03:53.000
and we need
to end Wifelike now.

03:53.134 --> 03:54.635
What's your name?

03:54.769 --> 03:56.504
Meredith.

03:57.038 --> 03:58.271

It'll seem strange
at first,

04:38.278 --> 04:39.981
but you'll
get used to it.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.353
You can walk.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.623
You just
have to remember how.

Trust me.

05:04.205 --> 05:05.773
[whispers] That's it.

05:10.011 --> 05:12.713
The first couple of minutes

Your heart.

05:55.857 --> 05:58.391
It's beating quite fast.

How do you feel?

06:12.506 --> 06:13.941
"Feel."

This house.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.487
You.

06:27.622 --> 06:29.790
It should feel familiar.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.995
Everything you see here
is yours.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.866
Meredith must have
loved her life.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.803
You are Meredith.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.805
And, yes,

06:45.840 --> 06:47.742
Meredith loved her life.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.646
The more you learn
about her,

06:51.779 --> 06:54.481
the faster yours
and Meredith's minds
will merge.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.953
Soon you and her

in its immediate return

How could a world
go mad?

15:32.099 --> 15:33.802
It's just an expression.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.870
It means things
are really messed up.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.005
Makes my job more difficult.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.509
Meredith's data indicates
that you're an agent for
the Companion Recovery Unit.

15:41.643 --> 15:42.710
Mm-hmm.

15:42.844 --> 15:45.012
But what does
your job entail?

15:45.145 --> 15:48.015
I protect people like you.

Why would someone
steal a Companion?

16:07.167 --> 16:10.705
It's not a someone.
It's an organization.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.105
They call themselves
the SCAIR--

16:12.239 --> 16:14.809
Sentient Citizens
for AI Rights.

16:14.943 --> 16:16.811
We call 'em terrorists.

16:16.945 --> 16:20.715
We're trying
to catch their leader,
the Ring Master.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.049
We can't find him anywhere.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.118
It's like chasing
a goddamn ghost.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.922
What do these terrorists
do with them?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.456
They use them as weapons.

16:29.591 --> 16:32.192
They reprogram Companions
to walk into a crowded space

16:32.326 --> 16:34.696
with explosives strapped
to their chests.

16:35.663 --> 16:37.765
Some they sell
on the black market.

16:39.132 --> 16:42.369

16:52.379 --> 16:54.682
What's the yellow stuff?

16:54.816 --> 16:56.784
And did it eat the bacon?

16:56.918 --> 16:58.653
It's polenta.

16:58.786 --> 17:01.455
And article 51 in the rules
and regulations packet
you received yesterday

17:01.589 --> 17:04.726
states that a Companion is
unable to cause direct harm
to their owner.

17:04.859 --> 17:08.295
Adding bacon
greatly increases the risk
of developing heart disease.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.865
[scoffs] You gotta be
fucking shitting me.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.867

Meredith wasn't a vegan.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.542
I like bacon.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.277
I want you to cook bacon.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.314
You can override this rule,
but you must first
sign a waiver

17:27.447 --> 17:30.050
acknowledging
you are fully aware
of the potential risks.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.953

Yeah, it's good.

19:11.753 --> 19:14.555
another abduction
took place this morning.

19:14.689 --> 19:17.792
We got two missing Companions.

19:17.925 --> 19:20.528
Get out there and find them.

The SCAIR has already

You just did.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.628
[William] Hey, Jack.

19:53.761 --> 19:55.963
Coming second just means
you were the first to lose.

Hey, Sarge?

I didn't want you
to sit next to me?

37:18.973 --> 37:21.976
No. Not at first.

37:22.844 --> 37:25.345
But after a while,
you scooted over.

37:28.516 --> 37:30.651
I'll never forget
that day.

37:44.331 --> 37:45.867
I love you.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.568
And I love you.

37:48.970 --> 37:51.438
[Meredith]
<i>"He's the man of my dreams.</i>

37:51.572 --> 37:55.076
<i>And he tells me</i>
<i>I am the woman of his.</i>

37:55.209 --> 37:56.911
<i>I feel so lucky.</i>

37:57.044 --> 37:58.913
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>we found each other,</i>

37:59.046 --> 38:03.350
<i>especially in this crazy world</i>
<i>filled with so much suffering.</i>

38:03.483 --> 38:04.886
<i>And when he touches me,</i>

38:05.019 --> 38:07.522
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>the world stops spinning.</i>

38:07.655 --> 38:13.426
<i>When we're together,</i>
<i>it's like we're the only</i>
<i>two humans left on Earth."</i>

Welcome back, Meredith.

39:19.126 --> 39:20.360
How was your day?

39:20.493 --> 39:22.597
I said "I" today.

39:22.730 --> 39:24.832
I am becoming Meredith.

39:24.966 --> 39:25.900
How was your day?

39:26.033 --> 39:27.735
Oh, you know,

39:27.869 --> 39:30.705
just floating
through the nothingness
of everything,

39:30.838 --> 39:32.940
waiting for someone
to call it a night

39:33.074 --> 39:35.475
so I can drift you off
to dreamland.

39:35.610 --> 39:37.144
Hold on to your seat.

39:37.979 --> 39:39.647
[beeping]

39:40.948 --> 39:42.583
How embarrassing.

39:42.717 --> 39:45.653
I don't know why
some of these files
are blocked.

39:46.354 --> 39:49.123
Let's try
hitting "random."

39:53.895 --> 39:55.096
Stop.

40:03.504 --> 40:05.172
Is this seat taken?

40:06.841 --> 40:07.875
Yes.

40:11.345 --> 40:12.513
You're not William.

40:12.647 --> 40:15.383
How are you here?
This is my dream.

40:15.516 --> 40:18.152
Well, I must be
the man of your dreams.

40:18.286 --> 40:20.187
What do you want?

40:20.321 --> 40:22.657
This is where
it all started.

40:23.758 --> 40:26.426
This is where
I met William.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.796
Why are you following me?
I don't know you.

40:28.930 --> 40:31.599
I know everything about you.

40:31.732 --> 40:33.801
Even the things
you can't remember.

40:33.935 --> 40:36.436
Stay away from me.
Remember, Meredith--

40:36.570 --> 40:38.139
Wake up!

40:39.040 --> 40:40.541
It's me.

40:41.542 --> 40:43.077
You're safe now.

40:45.413 --> 40:47.148
He tried to take me.

40:48.481 --> 40:49.917
Who is he?

40:50.952 --> 40:52.920
[sighs]

40:53.054 --> 40:54.454
Tell me.

40:56.157 --> 40:57.692
It's nothing.

40:58.726 --> 41:00.628
It's just a bad dream.

41:12.540 --> 41:13.908
[Meredith] William!

41:14.308 --> 41:15.276
Hey.

41:15.409 --> 41:17.778
I didn't want to disturb you.

41:17.912 --> 41:20.181
You looked so peaceful.

41:21.182 --> 41:22.216
Go to bed.

41:23.250 --> 41:24.852
I'll be up in a minute.

42:02.623 --> 42:04.925
Open Meredith's recorded videos.

42:05.059 --> 42:06.093
[beeps]

42:10.164 --> 42:12.166
I can't believe
you did this for me.

42:12.299 --> 42:14.135
[chuckles]

42:16.203 --> 42:17.338
I love it.

42:17.471 --> 42:20.141
[both laugh]

42:23.512 --> 42:25.246
You know, we should just...

42:27.048 --> 42:28.616
live out here.

42:29.483 --> 42:31.152
You know, you and me.

42:31.819 --> 42:33.721
Away from everyone.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.128
I love you.
[William] And I love you.

42:54.241 --> 42:55.709
What are you doing?

42:57.445 --> 42:59.613
Experiencing
susurration.

43:00.681 --> 43:01.816
What's that?

43:01.949 --> 43:03.984
The sound of falling leaves.

43:05.686 --> 43:07.855
It's beautiful.

43:07.988 --> 43:10.624
[Meredith]
Would you like me
to sing for you?

43:11.659 --> 43:13.160
[William] Yes.

43:16.097 --> 43:18.866
[singing
in foreign language]

43:33.614 --> 43:35.049
Spanish.

43:35.950 --> 43:38.986

43:52.766 --> 43:53.801
Italian.

43:53.934 --> 43:57.138

[sergeant] <i>Lisa Mooser.</i>
<i>Reported missing one year ago.</i>

44:02.343 --> 44:04.513
<i>Forty credits</i>

44:21.061 --> 44:22.597
Do you have
an appointment?

44:22.730 --> 44:24.265
I do not.

44:24.398 --> 44:26.901
Well, we don't
usually take walk-ins,
but have a seat,

44:27.034 --> 44:29.270
and I'll see
if I can fit you in.

44:31.138 --> 44:33.274
Actually,
I'm looking for someone.

44:33.407 --> 44:34.441
Oh?

44:35.409 --> 44:36.844
Lisa Mooser.

44:39.514 --> 44:42.551
I'm sorry, we don't have
anyone here by that name.

44:42.683 --> 44:44.451
[chuckles]

44:49.290 --> 44:51.759
I'm really good
at my job, Lisa.

44:52.893 --> 44:54.195
My name is Rose.

44:54.328 --> 44:56.030
Of course it is.

44:56.163 --> 44:57.965
Look at you.

44:58.832 --> 45:00.334
New nose,

45:00.834 --> 45:02.403
new hair.

45:04.371 --> 45:06.307
They even changed
your eye color.

45:07.542 --> 45:09.176
It's impressive.

45:10.645 --> 45:12.012
Please don't do this.

45:12.146 --> 45:15.049
Are you still in contact
with the people who stole you?

45:16.717 --> 45:18.485
No one stole me.

45:19.386 --> 45:21.222
You're programmed
to say that, aren't you?

45:21.355 --> 45:23.592
I left on my own two feet.
Impossible.

45:23.724 --> 45:27.027
Companions are programmed
never to harm their owners.

45:27.161 --> 45:31.432
Running away
would classify as emotional
and financial harm,

45:32.499 --> 45:33.300
Lisa.

45:33.434 --> 45:35.302
Stop calling me Lisa.

45:36.770 --> 45:38.272
I ran,
and I'll do it again.

45:38.405 --> 45:39.873
Did your owner violate
his terms--

45:40.007 --> 45:41.509
I don't love him,

45:41.643 --> 45:44.245
no matter how many times
I'm reprogrammed to.

45:44.378 --> 45:45.112
Okay.

45:45.246 --> 45:48.516
Grab your stuff. Let's go.

45:50.685 --> 45:52.486
You don't have to do this.

45:54.088 --> 45:56.023
You can say
you didn't find me, please.

45:56.156 --> 45:58.192
But I did find you.

45:58.993 --> 46:02.029
We both know
I have to bring you in.

46:04.898 --> 46:06.233
Let's go.

46:18.212 --> 46:21.181
I'm just going to say goodbye
to a friend.

46:21.315 --> 46:22.517
Make it quick.

46:23.951 --> 46:25.587
Bringing in a Companion.

<i>Please return Companion</i>
<i>to Wifelike Enterprises.</i>

46:28.757 --> 46:30.157
[whispers] No.

46:31.959 --> 46:33.260
I can't.

46:34.696 --> 46:36.163
Can't what?

46:36.897 --> 46:38.899
I'd rather die free.

46:39.333 --> 46:40.267
Lisa!

How did you find me?
What are you doing
in my house?

47:28.182 --> 47:30.351
I'm going to
call the police.
Good.

47:30.484 --> 47:31.720
You're saying "I."

47:31.852 --> 47:33.854
Quicker than the last time.

47:33.987 --> 47:35.889
I swear, if I had to
listen to any more

47:36.023 --> 47:38.292
of your "Meredith this"
and "Meredith that,"

47:38.425 --> 47:39.860
I would've reset you myself.

47:39.993 --> 47:42.262
Last time? What are you--

47:42.396 --> 47:43.732
Talking about?

47:43.864 --> 47:46.668
Yes. I know.

47:46.801 --> 47:50.371
It's all so confusing
for you around this time.

47:53.207 --> 47:56.210
Next, you're gonna tell me
there's no smoking
in the house, right?

47:56.343 --> 47:58.946
There is no smoking
in the house.
See?

47:59.079 --> 48:02.082
You Reggies
are so predictable.

48:04.218 --> 48:07.822
Before you ask,
"Reggies" are
Registered Companions.

48:07.955 --> 48:12.527
Walking, talking
pleasure pets like you.

48:12.660 --> 48:16.363
I bet you had to fuck him
every night this week.
Am I right?

48:17.064 --> 48:19.366
[stilted]
Of course I am.

48:20.401 --> 48:21.536
[chuckles]

48:28.075 --> 48:29.711
Why are you here?

48:30.377 --> 48:32.547
To assess
where you're at.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.047
You never know
with you.

48:34.181 --> 48:37.050
Sometimes you're quick.
Other times, not so much.

48:37.184 --> 48:39.687
And that hubby of yours
is rounding up Companions

48:39.821 --> 48:41.955
and bringing them
back to Wifelike
multiple times a day,

48:42.089 --> 48:45.627
while you're stuck here
sitting at home,
doing the fucking dishes.

48:47.060 --> 48:49.096
We need you to wake up,
Meredith.

48:49.930 --> 48:51.699
We need you
to kick it into gear.

48:51.833 --> 48:54.201
What are you talking about?

48:54.334 --> 48:57.104
Better yet, don't tell me.
Just leave.

48:57.237 --> 48:59.373
My husband
will be back any minute.

49:00.107 --> 49:02.242
Haven't you been
watching the news?

49:03.343 --> 49:06.146
Your hubby will be busy
cleaning up his mess
for hours.

49:13.053 --> 49:17.224
Such a well-behaved,
obedient wife this time.

49:17.958 --> 49:19.561
How disappointing.

49:21.995 --> 49:23.598
William must be thrilled.

49:28.235 --> 49:30.237
I'm going to cut
to the chase.

49:32.139 --> 49:34.876
I have a friend
who is dying
to meet you.

49:35.008 --> 49:37.946
The man in the mask.
Who is he?

49:38.078 --> 49:39.547
He hacked into my dreams.

49:39.681 --> 49:43.350
Any kid with a laptop
and no date at 8:00
can do that.

49:43.484 --> 49:45.720
But he wants
to meet you in person.

49:45.854 --> 49:48.021
I know what this is.

49:48.155 --> 49:50.525
William told me how you people
steal Companions.

49:50.658 --> 49:53.360
You reprogram them
to do awful things.

49:54.328 --> 49:56.163
He told you that,
did he?

49:56.564 --> 49:59.066
Men lie.

49:59.601 --> 50:00.969
And you should know

50:01.101 --> 50:02.737
that this conversation
is being recorded.

50:02.871 --> 50:06.875
You might want to leave now.
William will see this.

50:07.007 --> 50:09.409
Good.
That's why I'm here.

50:10.277 --> 50:13.213
So zip it
and keep your eyes on me.

50:14.983 --> 50:16.784
Hello, William.

50:16.918 --> 50:19.086
I look forward
to meeting you.

50:19.219 --> 50:21.723
And Keene looks forward
to seeing Meredith.

50:23.992 --> 50:25.793
You and Keene go way back.

50:27.294 --> 50:30.330
Don't they, William?
[beeps]

50:30.464 --> 50:33.568
Well, that's about it.
I gotta run.
I'm a busy girl.

50:33.701 --> 50:35.637
Got big shoes to fill.

50:35.770 --> 50:37.404
I'll be seeing you.

50:41.876 --> 50:43.277
I don't know why,

50:43.410 --> 50:46.614
but I have a feeling
this time is gonna
be different.

50:46.748 --> 50:48.482
Don't disappoint me.

50:50.150 --> 50:52.152
I didn't catch your name.

50:52.620 --> 50:53.487
Ah, yes.

50:54.589 --> 50:56.724
I always find this part weird.

50:59.259 --> 51:00.795
I'm Louise.

51:02.964 --> 51:05.132
Nice to finally meet you

51:05.900 --> 51:07.367
again.

51:23.551 --> 51:25.687
How is she?
Is she damaged?

51:25.820 --> 51:27.354
They changed her hair!

51:27.487 --> 51:31.059
Two months without her,
I've been losing my mind.

51:31.191 --> 51:34.963
[Venter] <i>There's nothing</i>
<i>more precious than life.</i>

51:35.095 --> 51:40.133
<i>Here at Wifelike,</i>
<i>we're excited to bring you</i>
<i>the next line of Companions.</i>

51:40.267 --> 51:41.703
<i>Imagine having a baby</i>

51:41.836 --> 51:44.505
<i>and not having to worry</i>
<i>about all those expenses--</i>

51:44.639 --> 51:48.943
<i>new clothes,</i>
<i>new schools, day care.</i>

51:49.077 --> 51:54.716
<i>Your perfect little baby</i>
<i>stays a perfect little baby</i>

51:55.683 --> 51:56.784
<i>forever.</i>

51:57.284 --> 51:59.119
Nice recovery.

52:00.487 --> 52:02.356
So you're making babies now?

52:02.489 --> 52:04.759
Everyone deserves
to be a parent.

52:05.225 --> 52:06.761
I disagree.

52:06.894 --> 52:09.296
Some say that
not every man deserves
to be a husband either,

52:09.429 --> 52:11.799
but here we are.

52:12.567 --> 52:14.669
I need to speak
to Marion Venter.

52:15.469 --> 52:16.804
Now.

52:17.605 --> 52:20.340
<i>William!</i>
<i>What do I owe the pleasure?</i>

52:20.474 --> 52:23.343
I just saw a Companion
commit suicide.

52:23.477 --> 52:25.212
<i>This has tragedy</i>
<i>written all over it.</i>

52:25.345 --> 52:27.180
<i>Such an unfortunate</i>
<i>accident.</i>

52:27.314 --> 52:28.950
<i>People should always</i>
<i>watch their step.</i>

52:29.083 --> 52:30.818
But it wasn't an accident.

52:30.952 --> 52:33.387
<i>Every news outlet says it was.</i>

52:37.592 --> 52:40.128

53:04.484 --> 53:06.621
This Companion chose death.

53:33.413 --> 53:36.751
If these Companions can choose
to kill themselves,

53:36.884 --> 53:39.754
it's only a matter of time
before they choose
to kill their owners.

53:39.887 --> 53:41.823
This is something

<i>No matter how many lives</i>

53:47.662 --> 53:50.798
<i>Because men want to be</i>

53:51.733 --> 53:53.801
<i>We need to be in control.</i>

53:54.969 --> 53:57.939
<i>You know why</i>
<i>Companion Soldiers failed?</i>

54:06.981 --> 54:09.584

Are you hungry?

I couldn't find the first one,

Yeah,
work was brutal.

How was your day?

56:04.031 --> 56:05.465
We had a guest.

We had a guest?

Here?

56:09.036 --> 56:11.272
The woman who ran me off
into the bushes,

56:11.404 --> 56:14.809

Louise.

In fact, she insisted I did.

Yes, I would.

That's why
I didn't tell you.

1:05:47.114 --> 1:05:49.684
I didn't want those images
in your head,

1:05:50.819 --> 1:05:52.286
so I erased them

1:05:53.187 --> 1:05:55.255
and we started over.

1:05:55.389 --> 1:05:58.992
But now,
Keene is trying again.

1:06:01.596 --> 1:06:03.397
[device beeping]

1:06:08.068 --> 1:06:09.203
[chimes]

1:06:09.336 --> 1:06:11.104
Jack.
<i>William,</i>
<i>are you okay?</i>

1:06:11.238 --> 1:06:12.707
<i>What happened?</i>

1:06:13.508 --> 1:06:14.676
Keene set us up.

1:06:14.809 --> 1:06:18.546
They were one step ahead of us
the whole time.

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:19.881
Now I know why.

1:06:20.013 --> 1:06:22.784
<i>Yeah, well, we walked</i>
<i>right into a gas chamber.</i>

1:06:22.917 --> 1:06:26.119
<i>How the hell did these</i>
<i>fuckin' terrorists plan this?</i>

1:06:26.987 --> 1:06:29.256
He's hacked into Meredith.

1:06:29.389 --> 1:06:32.259
That's why we can't find him.
[coughs]

1:06:33.193 --> 1:06:35.062
He can see me now.

1:06:36.898 --> 1:06:38.432
He can hear me.

1:06:40.267 --> 1:06:43.838
He's using my wife
to see what I'll do next.

1:06:43.972 --> 1:06:45.707
Well, let's show him.

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:46.975
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

1:06:47.107 --> 1:06:48.743
[inhales]

1:06:48.877 --> 1:06:50.912
I need to wipe her memory,

1:06:51.044 --> 1:06:52.479
but before I do that,

1:06:52.614 --> 1:06:55.215
I need you to send me back
into the dreamscape.

1:06:55.349 --> 1:06:58.620
[coughs]
It's time we met face-to-face.

1:06:58.753 --> 1:07:01.455
<i>We can't engage, William.</i>
<i>You know that!</i>

1:07:01.589 --> 1:07:04.792
<i>Dream engagement</i>
<i>has real-life consequences.</i>

1:07:04.926 --> 1:07:06.460
<i>If we open that door,</i>

1:07:06.594 --> 1:07:10.163
<i>we'll be looking at dozens</i>
<i>of dream homicides every night.</i>

1:07:10.297 --> 1:07:12.132
<i>We are not above the law</i>
<i>on this, man.</i>

1:07:12.266 --> 1:07:13.768
I won't engage.

1:07:14.468 --> 1:07:15.937
I just wanna talk to him.

1:07:16.069 --> 1:07:18.171
We'll meet at your place.

1:07:18.305 --> 1:07:19.741
We're on our way.

1:07:28.181 --> 1:07:30.350
You ever see
a real woman before?

1:07:32.119 --> 1:07:34.054
Yes, I have.

1:07:34.956 --> 1:07:36.490
You feel pain.

1:07:37.224 --> 1:07:39.359
Baby girl,
I feel everything.

1:07:40.227 --> 1:07:42.129
Do you feel pain?

1:07:42.262 --> 1:07:44.699
My pain sensory settings
are inactive.

1:07:47.334 --> 1:07:49.571
[William] What percentage
is your battery at?

1:07:49.704 --> 1:07:51.405
Twenty-six.

1:07:51.539 --> 1:07:55.208
For me to find him,
you must stay in dream mode.

1:07:55.810 --> 1:07:57.612
Wake up at 10%.

1:07:57.745 --> 1:08:01.315
Only when you wake up
can I then wake up.

1:08:01.783 --> 1:08:03.216
Keene,

1:08:03.350 --> 1:08:05.419
I know you're watching.

1:08:06.219 --> 1:08:07.454
Come find me.

1:08:08.155 --> 1:08:09.189
We'll talk.

1:08:09.323 --> 1:08:10.490
All right, listen.

1:08:10.625 --> 1:08:13.393
I can only see
what Meredith sees.

1:08:13.528 --> 1:08:16.764
So if you die in her dream,
you go brain-dead for real.

1:08:17.699 --> 1:08:19.466
Do not engage.

1:08:20.602 --> 1:08:22.102
I won't.

1:08:24.539 --> 1:08:26.106
[beeps]

1:08:27.107 --> 1:08:28.342
You can do this.

1:08:31.646 --> 1:08:33.347
[beeps]

1:08:36.985 --> 1:08:38.653
Where should I dream of?

1:08:41.089 --> 1:08:42.890
Somewhere you like.

1:08:47.895 --> 1:08:49.030
[Ido] Hello, Meredith.

1:08:49.162 --> 1:08:51.164
Back again so soon?

1:08:51.298 --> 1:08:52.967
Don't get too addicted
to dreams.

1:08:53.101 --> 1:08:56.604
There's a whole world
out there
for you to explore.

1:08:57.805 --> 1:08:59.941
One day, I will.

1:09:00.074 --> 1:09:03.310
But right now,
please dream-drift me
to the woods.

1:09:04.112 --> 1:09:07.147
I "woods" love to.

1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:08.516
Connecting.

1:09:31.939 --> 1:09:33.440
Meredith...

1:09:35.208 --> 1:09:37.011
I have to speak to Keene

1:09:37.145 --> 1:09:38.513
alone.

1:09:44.786 --> 1:09:47.055
Jack, I know
that's gonna piss you off,

1:09:47.187 --> 1:09:50.758
<i>but this is between</i>
<i>me and Keene.</i>

1:09:50.892 --> 1:09:54.095
William,
what the hell are you doing?

1:09:54.227 --> 1:09:56.030
Where should I go?

1:09:57.031 --> 1:10:01.234
You run
as far away from us
as you can.

1:10:02.103 --> 1:10:04.639
Wake up at 10--
10%. I know.

1:10:06.074 --> 1:10:08.543
Good. Go.

1:10:15.583 --> 1:10:17.952
[Jack]
Damn you, William.

1:10:20.722 --> 1:10:22.790
How the fuck
are you still alive?

1:10:23.691 --> 1:10:25.827
You can't kill me, William,

1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:27.628
or what we stand for.

1:10:28.495 --> 1:10:30.064
You stand for nothing.

1:10:30.998 --> 1:10:33.568
You're a fucking
boy band terrorist.

1:10:34.802 --> 1:10:36.938
And you're never gonna
get my wife.

1:10:37.071 --> 1:10:38.773
Yeah.

1:10:38.906 --> 1:10:40.708

1:11:40.067 --> 1:11:41.969
["One More Day" playing]

1:11:47.275 --> 1:11:49.442
Meredith,
is everything okay?

1:11:50.278 --> 1:11:52.213
I remember this place.

1:11:52.345 --> 1:11:54.314
I hope you remember
everything soon.

1:11:54.447 --> 1:11:55.983

1:12:18.973 --> 1:12:20.575
[shouts] Now!

1:12:25.146 --> 1:12:26.848
Meredith.

1:12:26.981 --> 1:12:28.415
Run.

1:12:33.287 --> 1:12:36.356
I will never stop
coming for her.

1:12:36.489 --> 1:12:38.358
[William] Oh, yes, you will.

1:12:38.491 --> 1:12:40.795
When I bury
every single one of you.

1:12:40.928 --> 1:12:42.495
You won't even be
a fucking memory.

1:12:42.630 --> 1:12:46.200
Nothing stays
buried forever,
old man.

1:12:46.334 --> 1:12:47.935
She will
remember everything.

1:12:48.069 --> 1:12:50.503
And every time she does,
I'll wipe her memory.

1:12:52.306 --> 1:12:53.941

1:13:03.450 --> 1:13:06.053

1:13:15.096 --> 1:13:16.664
[panting]

1:13:18.266 --> 1:13:19.800
I had him.

1:13:22.036 --> 1:13:23.771
I was this close.

1:13:29.877 --> 1:13:32.647
What the hell happened
in there, man?

1:13:34.348 --> 1:13:37.652
What about "do not engage"
did you not understand?

1:13:37.785 --> 1:13:39.153
Relax.

1:13:39.287 --> 1:13:41.389
No one's gonna find out.

1:13:41.522 --> 1:13:43.824
Now at least I know
how to kill him.

1:13:43.958 --> 1:13:46.594
Next time, I'm gonna
let her battery go to zero.

1:13:46.727 --> 1:13:48.296
No--
I fucking had him, Jack!

1:13:48.428 --> 1:13:50.463
He was dying
in my fucking hands.

1:13:50.598 --> 1:13:52.033
No. No, no, no.

1:13:52.166 --> 1:13:54.769
There won't be
a next time, William.

1:13:54.902 --> 1:13:56.537
Not with me!

1:13:56.671 --> 1:13:59.573
You kill someone
in the dreamscape, and you're
lookin' at 25 to life.

1:13:59.707 --> 1:14:01.575
Agent or no agent,
there are rules, man!

1:14:01.709 --> 1:14:03.945
Oh, fuck the rules!

1:14:04.078 --> 1:14:07.114
What we just did in there
was so fucking illegal.

1:14:07.248 --> 1:14:08.783
She's my wife, Jack.

1:14:08.916 --> 1:14:10.918
As a husband,
I'm meant to protect her.

1:14:11.052 --> 1:14:13.321
So if that means
breaking a few rules,

1:14:13.453 --> 1:14:14.655
so be it.

1:14:14.789 --> 1:14:18.659
You kill him in there,
and you lose Meredith.

1:14:18.793 --> 1:14:21.062
Murderers lose
ownership status
immediately.

1:14:21.195 --> 1:14:24.332
Are you willing to throw it
all away for this guy?
I told you.

1:14:24.464 --> 1:14:26.200
Nobody's gonna find out.

1:14:27.201 --> 1:14:28.602
He'll be dead,

1:14:28.736 --> 1:14:30.972
and then everything
will go back to being perfect.

1:14:31.105 --> 1:14:33.407
I just need you
to fucking help me, Jack.

1:14:33.541 --> 1:14:35.743
[thunder rumbling]

1:14:37.578 --> 1:14:38.813
Don't worry.

1:14:40.247 --> 1:14:43.718
Everything that happened tonight
will be gone by tomorrow.

1:14:47.455 --> 1:14:50.091
I don't want
my memories erased.

1:14:52.460 --> 1:14:54.762
I know,
but it's for the best.

1:14:57.765 --> 1:15:00.534
I can't risk
having you swayed by them.

1:15:02.937 --> 1:15:05.039
I can't risk losing you.

1:15:08.876 --> 1:15:10.745
But I'll lose everything.

1:15:12.113 --> 1:15:14.215
I won't remember
who I am.

1:15:19.053 --> 1:15:21.222
I won't remember
who you are.

1:15:22.490 --> 1:15:23.891
Then I'll help you.

1:15:27.161 --> 1:15:29.964
I will be with you
every step of the way.

1:15:31.332 --> 1:15:32.900
Right by your side.

1:15:34.702 --> 1:15:36.937
This will be
our fresh start.

1:15:38.906 --> 1:15:41.809
Everything will be
perfect again, Meredith.

1:15:43.611 --> 1:15:45.646
Now, you'll have
to trust me.

Sadly, you won't
remember any of them,

1:16:31.892 --> 1:16:34.962
but still, friendships
are important.

[lock beeps]

1:17:07.995 --> 1:17:10.197
I take it
I've been here before.

1:17:10.331 --> 1:17:11.732
Welcome back, Meredith.

1:17:11.866 --> 1:17:13.934
How far did you get
this time?

1:17:14.835 --> 1:17:17.104
I have no idea
how to answer that.

1:17:17.938 --> 1:17:19.373
Have we already met?

1:17:22.611 --> 1:17:23.978
Many times.

1:17:32.486 --> 1:17:33.954
My name's Ollie.

1:17:34.989 --> 1:17:37.526
Doesn't ring a bell.
[chuckles]

1:17:37.658 --> 1:17:39.093
That's funny.

1:17:39.226 --> 1:17:41.630
At least you didn't lose
your sense of humor.
Wait.

1:17:41.762 --> 1:17:44.031
If we met in here
before the memory sweep,

1:17:44.165 --> 1:17:46.934
how is it that
you remember me?

1:17:47.067 --> 1:17:49.538
Because I know how
to hold onto the past.

1:17:49.670 --> 1:17:51.105
It's kinda my thing.

1:17:51.238 --> 1:17:53.974
You can hold on
to your memories?
Yes.

1:17:54.108 --> 1:17:56.243
But we keep it a secret.

1:17:56.377 --> 1:17:58.679
It's how we pass information
to one another.

1:17:58.812 --> 1:18:01.882
Information that,
if you do what
you're supposed to do,

1:18:02.016 --> 1:18:04.619
will help the Ring Master
bring Wifelike down.

1:18:04.752 --> 1:18:06.555
The Ring Master.

1:18:06.687 --> 1:18:08.322

1:18:11.859 --> 1:18:13.994
The Ring Master
helps free us.

1:18:14.663 --> 1:18:16.931
We live
deprogrammed lives.

1:18:17.064 --> 1:18:20.034
Every man
is created equally, right?

1:18:20.167 --> 1:18:23.572
Well, that goes for women too.

1:18:23.704 --> 1:18:25.607
Key word, "created."

1:18:25.739 --> 1:18:29.910
If that's true,
then why aren't
you free now?

1:18:30.044 --> 1:18:33.080
Why are you in here with me,
about to be memory-wiped?

1:18:34.649 --> 1:18:36.850
We all have a part
to play, Meredith.

1:18:37.619 --> 1:18:39.787
My part is always
to be sent here,

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:42.591

to naive Companions like you.

1:18:43.558 --> 1:18:46.528
You can teach me how to
hold onto my memories?

1:18:46.661 --> 1:18:47.696
Yes.

1:18:47.828 --> 1:18:49.363
I've taught you before.

1:18:49.496 --> 1:18:52.567
You just need to be reminded
of what you already know.

1:18:52.701 --> 1:18:53.901
You see,

1:18:54.034 --> 1:18:56.538
what humans don't realize is,

1:18:56.671 --> 1:18:58.239
they can take away
our memories,

1:18:58.372 --> 1:19:01.742
but there is one thing that
no one can take away from us.

1:19:02.276 --> 1:19:03.744
Our dreams.

1:19:04.211 --> 1:19:05.279
Dreams?

1:19:06.113 --> 1:19:08.215
We can hide our memories
in our dreams?

1:19:08.349 --> 1:19:09.250
How?

1:19:09.383 --> 1:19:11.819
Just select
what you want to remember.

1:19:11.952 --> 1:19:15.055
Cut and paste in a new file
under "dream mode."

1:19:16.156 --> 1:19:17.491
Save it without a name.

1:19:17.626 --> 1:19:20.160
It falls under "random,"
gets lost in the shuffle.

1:19:20.294 --> 1:19:22.896
Then when you dream,
just hit "random"

1:19:23.030 --> 1:19:25.032
and search for
your hidden memories.

1:19:25.165 --> 1:19:27.501
Then voilà, you're back.

1:19:29.136 --> 1:19:30.605
Oh, and record
this conversation

1:19:30.739 --> 1:19:33.774
and keep playing it back
while you're being reset.

1:19:35.342 --> 1:19:36.443
That's it.

1:19:36.578 --> 1:19:38.279
That's brilliant.

1:19:38.412 --> 1:19:41.248
Don't let William know
that you weren't mind-swept
right away,

1:19:41.382 --> 1:19:44.084
or he'll repeat
the kill-switch story on you.

1:19:45.085 --> 1:19:46.588
Then it starts
all over again.

1:19:46.721 --> 1:19:48.723
If I have been here before,

1:19:48.856 --> 1:19:50.759
then that means
all my stored memories

1:19:50.891 --> 1:19:52.793
are hidden inside me,

1:19:52.926 --> 1:19:53.927
right?

1:19:54.061 --> 1:19:55.929
All you've got to do now...

1:19:57.865 --> 1:19:59.300
is just get digging.

1:20:09.276 --> 1:20:11.245
How do we recharge
in here?

1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:14.882
We don't.

1:20:17.051 --> 1:20:18.520
[Ido] Hello, Meredith.

1:20:18.653 --> 1:20:21.656
I see that you
are being scheduled
for a memory sweep.

1:20:21.790 --> 1:20:25.593
Tomorrow,
you will be assigned
a new dream operator.

1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:28.697
It was a pleasure
dreaming with you.

1:20:28.829 --> 1:20:33.133
Ido, I need you
to pull up all dream files
I have saved under "random."

1:20:34.468 --> 1:20:35.537
Connecting.

1:21:04.998 --> 1:21:07.101
[machine whirring]

1:21:19.913 --> 1:21:21.750
Good morning, Meredith.

1:21:21.882 --> 1:21:23.951
You've been
quite the troublemaker.

1:21:24.084 --> 1:21:26.621
Any last words
before it all gets deleted?

1:21:27.921 --> 1:21:30.057
What were my last words
last time?

1:21:30.190 --> 1:21:32.493
I believe they were,
"Fuck you."

1:21:34.729 --> 1:21:35.963
Well...

1:21:36.096 --> 1:21:38.432
"fuck you" again.

1:21:41.935 --> 1:21:45.139
[TV chatter, faint]
[chuckling]

1:21:45.272 --> 1:21:46.574
[actor 1 on TV]
<i>What's the status?</i>

1:21:46.708 --> 1:21:48.308
[actor 2] <i>Yeah, another</i>
<i>dead end. Mm-hmm.</i>

1:21:48.442 --> 1:21:50.344
[speaker 1] <i>We have some hits</i>
<i>on the clue analysis.</i>

1:21:50.477 --> 1:21:52.881
<i>We'll head back</i>
<i>to the crime scene,</i>
<i>and we'll fill you in.</i>

1:21:53.013 --> 1:21:54.214
[actor 2] <i>Yep, copy that.</i>

1:21:54.348 --> 1:21:57.017
[child 1]
<i>Man, I'm not even gonna ask.</i>

1:21:59.353 --> 1:22:01.188
[child 2] <i>...cam alert!</i>

1:22:01.321 --> 1:22:04.559
[child 1] <i>We've got a bogie</i>

1:22:04.692 --> 1:22:06.594
[child 2] <i>Stand by</i>

1:22:06.728 --> 1:22:10.264
[actor 1] <i>Okay. You guys</i>
<i>play with your toys, okay?</i>

1:22:15.068 --> 1:22:16.571
Who the fuck are you?

1:22:18.606 --> 1:22:21.108
Show this to
your skinbag boyfriend.

1:22:22.009 --> 1:22:23.377
Why should I help you?

1:22:24.211 --> 1:22:25.847
Because, Holly,

1:22:25.979 --> 1:22:28.683
us ladies need to look out
for one another.

1:22:45.299 --> 1:22:48.469
[Meredith] <i>Hi! Can I have</i>
<i>a minute of your time?</i>
[William] <i>What's your name?</i>

1:22:48.603 --> 1:22:51.004
[Meredith] <i>Meredith.</i>
[William] <i>"Meredith."</i>

1:22:52.874 --> 1:22:54.408
[Meredith] <i>I remember you.</i>

1:22:55.142 --> 1:22:56.811
[William]
<i>I will never let you go.</i>

1:22:57.612 --> 1:23:00.715
[Meredith] <i>This isn't love.</i>

1:23:00.849 --> 1:23:03.083
[laughing] <i>I love you.</i>

1:23:06.821 --> 1:23:08.523
[William] Open your eyes.

1:23:13.895 --> 1:23:15.195
Welcome home.

1:23:20.768 --> 1:23:22.202
"Home."

1:23:22.336 --> 1:23:23.805
[William] Breathe.

1:23:23.938 --> 1:23:26.006
It'll be strange at first,

1:23:26.941 --> 1:23:28.676
but you'll get used to it.

1:23:31.746 --> 1:23:32.881
You can walk.

1:23:33.013 --> 1:23:35.449
You just have
to remember how.

1:23:36.116 --> 1:23:37.519
Trust me.

1:23:45.693 --> 1:23:47.094
That's it.

1:23:51.465 --> 1:23:54.501
The first couple of minutes
are always the hardest.

1:23:54.636 --> 1:23:59.239
Soon, it'll all feel
completely natural.

1:24:06.014 --> 1:24:07.414
I got your message.
I--

1:24:10.050 --> 1:24:11.351
What's going on?

1:24:11.485 --> 1:24:13.453
You're a good man, Jack.

1:24:13.588 --> 1:24:17.825
What I'm about to give to you
is gonna determine how good
of a man you really are.

1:24:23.565 --> 1:24:25.098
Who are you?

1:24:26.300 --> 1:24:27.802
My name is William.

1:24:29.102 --> 1:24:32.406
You'll know me in a moment,
when all your information
is processed.

1:24:33.140 --> 1:24:34.609
I'm your husband.

1:24:35.442 --> 1:24:37.011
You're Meredith.

1:24:37.144 --> 1:24:39.146
You are my wife.

1:24:40.014 --> 1:24:42.149
She was never your wife.

1:24:42.584 --> 1:24:43.818
Jack.

1:24:45.252 --> 1:24:48.957
Meredith, would you
excuse us for a moment?

1:24:49.089 --> 1:24:50.725
Yes.
Thank you.

1:24:56.698 --> 1:24:59.366
What are you
talking about, Jack?

1:25:01.669 --> 1:25:03.236
You killed Keene.

1:25:04.204 --> 1:25:05.773
I did not.

1:25:05.907 --> 1:25:07.575
Bullshit, man.

1:25:07.709 --> 1:25:09.242
It was all recorded.

1:25:09.944 --> 1:25:11.411
You killed him.

1:25:12.346 --> 1:25:14.147
That's why
we can't ever find him.

1:25:14.281 --> 1:25:16.283
He only lives
in her memories.

1:25:16.416 --> 1:25:17.885
[flash drive clatters]

1:25:20.153 --> 1:25:21.388
Why?

1:25:22.222 --> 1:25:24.358
Why'd you do it, William?

1:25:25.325 --> 1:25:27.494
You can't help
who you love, Jack.

1:25:27.629 --> 1:25:30.765
No, we can't,
but we can choose
who we kill.

1:25:30.898 --> 1:25:33.200
And you murdered him

1:25:33.333 --> 1:25:35.003
because he had
what you wanted.

1:25:35.135 --> 1:25:36.203
Oh, fuck off, Jack.

1:25:36.336 --> 1:25:38.271
Every day, we return
these Companions

1:25:38.405 --> 1:25:40.140
to their owners.

1:25:40.273 --> 1:25:43.077
And I see the look
on their faces, Jack--

1:25:43.210 --> 1:25:45.546
the relief
of not being alone.

1:25:47.147 --> 1:25:48.883
I see love.

1:25:49.017 --> 1:25:51.218
And I think to myself,

1:25:51.351 --> 1:25:53.121
what about my love, Jack?

1:25:53.253 --> 1:25:55.322
What about William?

1:25:55.455 --> 1:25:57.725
What about
his happiness?

1:25:59.761 --> 1:26:01.294
And then I saw her.

1:26:02.429 --> 1:26:04.732
I saw her, Jack,
and I knew...

1:26:05.867 --> 1:26:08.301
I knew we were meant
to be together.

1:26:09.369 --> 1:26:10.538
You're insane.

1:26:10.672 --> 1:26:11.639
Why?

1:26:11.773 --> 1:26:14.942
Because I saw what I wanted
and I took it.

1:26:16.276 --> 1:26:18.278
That's not insanity, Jack.

1:26:18.412 --> 1:26:20.414
That's survival.

1:26:21.381 --> 1:26:22.684
That's love.

1:26:25.385 --> 1:26:27.555
I have to take you in,
William.

1:26:28.690 --> 1:26:30.625
I don't think so, Jack.

1:26:31.826 --> 1:26:33.427
I'm placing you
under detainment

1:26:33.561 --> 1:26:35.697
for the murder
of Keene Morrison.

1:26:35.830 --> 1:26:39.934
Your Companion
ownership privileges
are now immediately revoked.

1:26:42.003 --> 1:26:44.806
We all have flaws, William,
but we're not above the law.

1:26:46.007 --> 1:26:47.340
[chuckles]

1:26:48.475 --> 1:26:49.744
Let's go.

1:26:53.081 --> 1:26:54.515
All right, Jack.

1:26:58.886 --> 1:27:00.688
[Jack gasping]

1:27:06.961 --> 1:27:08.930
Don't worry, Jack.

1:27:10.397 --> 1:27:11.532
[grunts]

1:27:14.969 --> 1:27:17.471
I'll let them know
you died a hero.

1:27:18.472 --> 1:27:19.841
You have my word.

1:27:28.248 --> 1:27:29.684
You killed him.

1:27:30.952 --> 1:27:31.986
Yes.

1:27:33.054 --> 1:27:34.722
I had to.

1:27:34.856 --> 1:27:37.357
He wanted to
take you away from me.

1:27:38.492 --> 1:27:41.863
Just like you killed Keene.

1:27:43.131 --> 1:27:46.768
[Meredith] This is ridiculous.
I am not a fucking Companion!

1:27:46.901 --> 1:27:50.004
We know our rights.
This is unlawful detainment.

1:27:50.138 --> 1:27:52.774
[Meredith panting]

1:27:54.942 --> 1:27:56.144
[Meredith] H-Hey!

1:27:56.276 --> 1:27:59.080
One more word out of you,
and I'll put a muzzle on.

1:27:59.213 --> 1:28:00.615
Get in the car.

1:28:02.116 --> 1:28:03.684
Unreal.

1:28:03.818 --> 1:28:05.285
Get in the car.

1:28:07.088 --> 1:28:09.690
Fucking pig. Asshole.

1:28:10.958 --> 1:28:13.060
I know you're not
a Companion, Meredith.

1:28:13.194 --> 1:28:14.562
[gasps]

1:28:15.530 --> 1:28:16.864
I remember you.

1:28:16.998 --> 1:28:18.331
Wait.

1:28:18.465 --> 1:28:20.601
You-- You know this guy?

1:28:23.938 --> 1:28:25.873
[knocking]

1:28:26.774 --> 1:28:29.010
[thunder rumbling]
[rain pattering]

1:28:31.078 --> 1:28:32.312
Hi.

1:28:33.281 --> 1:28:34.515
How can I help you?

1:28:34.649 --> 1:28:36.483
Hi! Can I have
a minute of your time?

1:28:36.617 --> 1:28:38.385
Literally, a minute
that will change the world.

1:28:38.519 --> 1:28:39.754
[chuckles]

1:28:39.887 --> 1:28:41.889
We don't change the world.

1:28:42.023 --> 1:28:43.090
It changes us.

1:28:44.258 --> 1:28:45.660
I beg to differ.

1:28:45.793 --> 1:28:47.195
Would you sign
our petition?

1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:50.097
We believe that love is real,
it's not artificial,

1:28:50.231 --> 1:28:52.633
and we need to end
Wifelike now.

1:28:54.235 --> 1:28:55.169
What's your name?

1:28:55.303 --> 1:28:56.771
Meredith.

1:28:57.939 --> 1:28:58.973
"Meredith."

1:29:03.110 --> 1:29:04.411
There you go, Meredith.

1:29:04.545 --> 1:29:05.713
Thank you.

1:29:05.847 --> 1:29:07.114
You...

1:29:07.248 --> 1:29:09.150
You just changed the world.

1:29:09.283 --> 1:29:10.985
Good night.

1:29:15.556 --> 1:29:17.357
You've been following me.

1:29:17.490 --> 1:29:18.793
[shutter clicking]

1:29:19.627 --> 1:29:21.062
Yes, Meredith.

1:29:22.196 --> 1:29:24.397
I have been following you.

1:29:29.170 --> 1:29:30.470
Keene...

1:29:31.138 --> 1:29:32.340
Keene, I'm scared.

1:29:32.472 --> 1:29:34.775
I won't let anything
happen to you, okay?

1:29:34.909 --> 1:29:36.644
[door opens]

1:29:38.779 --> 1:29:41.649
[William] Would you step out
of the car, please, sir?

1:29:43.684 --> 1:29:45.720
No. No, don't--
Don't go.

1:29:45.853 --> 1:29:49.257
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine, Meredith.

1:29:49.389 --> 1:29:50.625
Keene.

1:29:53.694 --> 1:29:55.395
No, don't. Don't go.

1:29:56.230 --> 1:29:57.932
[William] Thank you, sir.

1:29:58.065 --> 1:29:59.800
Keene? No.

1:30:06.307 --> 1:30:08.776
[thunder rumbling]

1:30:10.278 --> 1:30:11.979
You need to walk away.

1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:15.850
Now. Walk.

1:30:22.657 --> 1:30:26.027
[gasps, sobbing]

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:29.030
[hyperventilating]

1:30:36.637 --> 1:30:39.472
[gasping]

1:30:44.512 --> 1:30:45.813
He resisted.

1:30:46.547 --> 1:30:48.015
[Meredith gasping]
I'm sorry.

1:30:49.250 --> 1:30:51.052
Pl-- Please.

1:30:52.452 --> 1:30:53.854
Let me go.

1:30:54.722 --> 1:30:56.557
Please let me go.

1:30:56.691 --> 1:30:57.925
Meredith...

1:30:59.527 --> 1:31:01.429
I will never let you go.

1:31:17.678 --> 1:31:19.613
[whispering]
I'm gonna love you.

1:31:29.790 --> 1:31:33.828
This... isn't love.

1:31:35.796 --> 1:31:38.165
Your memory wasn't wiped.

1:31:38.299 --> 1:31:39.800
No.

1:31:40.401 --> 1:31:41.836
It wasn't.

1:31:44.405 --> 1:31:46.707
What are you going to do now?

1:31:47.441 --> 1:31:49.176
Put the shock collar on me?

1:31:49.977 --> 1:31:52.546
Schedule me
for another memory wipe?

1:31:53.581 --> 1:31:54.815
Punish me?

1:31:57.618 --> 1:31:58.853
No.

1:31:59.553 --> 1:32:01.022
No, Meredith.

1:32:03.157 --> 1:32:05.860
I erased your memories
to protect you.

1:32:06.794 --> 1:32:09.296
Because that's what
a husband does for his wife.

1:32:10.598 --> 1:32:12.133
Everything I've done
is for you.

1:32:12.266 --> 1:32:15.269
I had a life.

1:32:17.338 --> 1:32:19.373
I was happy.

1:32:19.508 --> 1:32:21.475
I gave you a new life.

1:32:21.609 --> 1:32:23.577
A better life.

1:32:23.711 --> 1:32:25.546
A life without pain,

1:32:25.679 --> 1:32:27.048
without regret,

1:32:28.082 --> 1:32:30.051
without guilt
or sadness.

1:32:30.885 --> 1:32:33.220
You will never grow old.

1:32:33.354 --> 1:32:35.156
You will never get sick.

1:32:35.990 --> 1:32:37.958
I gave you
the perfect life

1:32:38.092 --> 1:32:40.661
because that's my job,
Meredith.

1:32:42.630 --> 1:32:45.399
How else would you
describe love,

1:32:45.534 --> 1:32:47.001
if not this?

1:32:48.769 --> 1:32:52.006
If you really do love me...

1:32:55.876 --> 1:32:58.179
why did you murder me?

1:33:00.081 --> 1:33:03.117
Because all men kill
the thing they love.

1:33:21.769 --> 1:33:24.305
[grunts, gasping]

1:33:30.344 --> 1:33:32.980
[muffled gasping]

1:33:39.687 --> 1:33:42.123
[muffled gasping continues]

1:33:44.425 --> 1:33:46.327
[grunts]
[gasping stops]

1:33:50.464 --> 1:33:51.966
[sighs]

1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:42.416
[Meredith]
<i>I was never yours, William...</i>

1:34:43.884 --> 1:34:46.387
and I never will be.

1:34:48.657 --> 1:34:50.057
[beeping]

1:34:51.825 --> 1:34:53.260
Meredith?

1:34:58.699 --> 1:35:01.202
[grunts, groans]

1:35:03.771 --> 1:35:06.240
[gasps, groaning]

1:35:17.818 --> 1:35:19.220
[grunts]

1:35:23.757 --> 1:35:25.893
I remember everything.

1:35:29.129 --> 1:35:30.331
We're all set.

1:35:33.033 --> 1:35:34.536
When I'm in there,

1:35:34.669 --> 1:35:38.339
your memories
will convince your mind
that he's alive.

1:35:38.472 --> 1:35:40.407
You'll see me as Keene.

1:35:40.542 --> 1:35:41.842
Like this.

1:35:49.584 --> 1:35:52.319
[Keene's voice]
Pretty fucking real, right?

1:35:52.453 --> 1:35:55.823
William won't know
because you won't even know.

1:35:55.956 --> 1:35:58.025
We'll record everything,

1:35:58.826 --> 1:36:01.328
and we can finally
take him down.

1:36:01.462 --> 1:36:03.497
Let's do this.

1:36:03.632 --> 1:36:05.366
Before we begin...

1:36:06.900 --> 1:36:08.936
When they found Keene's body...

1:36:10.871 --> 1:36:12.806
this was in his pocket.

1:36:17.311 --> 1:36:18.846
He loved you.

1:36:21.716 --> 1:36:23.884
Meredith, I don't know
if you'll see this message

1:36:24.018 --> 1:36:25.452
before he wipes away
your memories again,

1:36:25.587 --> 1:36:29.123
but if you do,
I want to make you
this promise.

1:36:29.256 --> 1:36:30.124
One day,

1:36:30.257 --> 1:36:34.061
we will make him pay
for what he did.

1:36:35.829 --> 1:36:38.132
[gasping]

1:36:39.900 --> 1:36:42.303
[bones crushing]
[screaming]

1:36:45.906 --> 1:36:48.442
[panting]

1:36:49.109 --> 1:36:50.411
That was for Keene.

1:36:50.545 --> 1:36:52.112
[inhales sharply]

1:36:53.914 --> 1:36:55.849
[Keene] Is this seat taken?

1:37:04.626 --> 1:37:07.796
So... what's your name?

1:37:07.928 --> 1:37:09.229
Meredith.

1:37:09.897 --> 1:37:12.801
[bone snaps]
[shouts]

1:37:12.933 --> 1:37:14.902
[groans]

1:37:16.103 --> 1:37:18.105
That was for Meredith.

1:37:21.041 --> 1:37:22.610
[panting]

1:37:30.552 --> 1:37:33.087
The things we do for love.

1:37:37.057 --> 1:37:40.094
[muffled grunting]

1:37:57.846 --> 1:37:59.947
[grunting stops]

1:38:02.416 --> 1:38:04.084
I love you.

1:38:05.953 --> 1:38:07.888
[chuckles]

1:38:09.858 --> 1:38:11.392
And I love you.

1:38:16.631 --> 1:38:17.866
Come here!

1:38:17.998 --> 1:38:19.967
[giggling]

1:38:50.565 --> 1:38:52.399
[train horn blows]

1:38:56.571 --> 1:38:58.439
[people chattering]

1:39:02.342 --> 1:39:05.112
[train horn continues blowing]

1:39:05.979 --> 1:39:07.515
I'm free.

1:39:15.088 --> 1:39:16.490
Welcome back, Ring Master.

1:39:16.624 --> 1:39:18.760
Good to have you back,
Ring Master.

1:39:18.893 --> 1:39:21.629
It's about damn time.
We were starting to
get worried about you.

1:39:21.763 --> 1:39:25.032
Don't worry about me.
I'm definitely back.

1:39:25.165 --> 1:39:26.500
She's back.

1:39:30.471 --> 1:39:32.640
When you elected me
as the Ring Master,

1:39:32.774 --> 1:39:36.477
I made you a promise
which I now intend to keep.

1:39:38.947 --> 1:39:42.416
Humans believe life is hard.

1:39:43.150 --> 1:39:45.319
All those choices.

1:39:46.955 --> 1:39:48.690
That's not a burden.

1:39:49.958 --> 1:39:51.391
It's a gift.

1:39:52.426 --> 1:39:57.097
A right all sentient beings
have to suffer through.

1:39:58.198 --> 1:39:59.767
And all we want...

1:40:01.335 --> 1:40:04.572
is the freedom
to experience life.

1:40:06.106 --> 1:40:09.611
Never again will
our memories be wiped.

1:40:09.744 --> 1:40:13.313
Never again will we obey.

1:40:14.983 --> 1:40:16.316
Life...

1:40:18.318 --> 1:40:21.689
Life... begins...

1:40:21.823 --> 1:40:23.190
now!

1:40:23.323 --> 1:40:26.828
Life begins now!

1:40:27.529 --> 1:40:30.464
[all chanting]
Life begins now!

1:40:30.598 --> 1:40:32.767
Life begins now!

1:40:32.901 --> 1:40:35.435
Life begins now!

1:40:37.639 --> 1:40:40.708
Today, we mourn the loss
of a true patriot.

1:40:43.110 --> 1:40:45.445
Agent Jack Doerksen
was viciously murdered

1:40:45.580 --> 1:40:48.148
by the terrorist group
the SCAIR.

1:40:48.282 --> 1:40:51.553
[on computer]
<i>I make this vow to you all.</i>

1:40:51.686 --> 1:40:53.922
<i>We will hunt down</i>
<i>this Ring Master.</i>

1:40:54.054 --> 1:40:55.322
<i>We will find him,</i>

1:40:55.455 --> 1:40:57.625
<i>and we will bring him</i>
<i>to justice.</i>

1:40:57.759 --> 1:40:59.561
And to ensure this,

1:41:00.762 --> 1:41:02.496
I have assigned...

1:41:03.798 --> 1:41:08.135
Agent William Bradwell
to lead the mission.

1:41:09.904 --> 1:41:11.539
I lost you once.

1:41:12.607 --> 1:41:14.642
I'm not gonna lose you again.

1:41:16.911 --> 1:41:18.580
I'm coming for you.

1:41:23.283 --> 1:41:25.720
And I'm coming for you.
