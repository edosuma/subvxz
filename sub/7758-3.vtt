00:11.245 --> 00:13.245
* ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:49.650 --> 00:51.790
- ABOUT A WEEK
AFTER THEIR BABY WAS BORN,

00:51.819 --> 00:53.819
THANKS IN PART
TO THE INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION

00:53.854 --> 00:55.294
OF BRIAN KINNEY,

00:55.323 --> 00:57.193
LINDSAY AND MELANIE
HAD A PARTY.

00:57.225 --> 01:00.355
THEY INVITED A HERD OF THEIR
NEAREST AND DEAREST LESBIANS,

01:00.394 --> 01:02.704
ASSORTED RELATIVES,
AND US,

01:02.730 --> 01:06.370
THE FRIENDS OF THE FATHER,
TO THEIR HOUSE.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.370
IT WAS REALLY NICE,

01:08.402 --> 01:11.212
THE SMELL OF BREAD BAKING
AND FRESH FLOWERS

01:11.239 --> 01:12.569
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.276
NOT LIKE GOING TO ONE
OF MY FRIENDS' PLACES,

01:14.308 --> 01:15.278
WITH THE SMELL
OF DIRTY LAUNDRY

01:15.309 --> 01:20.179
AND STACKS OF PORN TAPES
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.254
I'M SCARED OF HIM.
I'M JUST GONNA GO INSIDE.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.422
- OKAY,
WE'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.120
- SHIRLEY! SHIRLEY!

01:24.152 --> 01:26.222
HAVE YOU SEEN, UH, NORMAN?

01:26.254 --> 01:27.624
- SEEING THEM
IN THEIR BEAUTIFUL HOME

01:27.655 --> 01:28.715
WITH THEIR NEW BABY

01:28.756 --> 01:30.856
AND THEIR ARMS
AROUND EACH OTHER,

01:30.891 --> 01:35.431
I WISHED, FOR A MOMENT,
THAT I TOO COULD BE A LESBIAN.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.833
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
I'D HAVE TO EAT PUSSY,

01:36.864 --> 01:39.874
SO I SAID, "FORGET IT."

01:39.900 --> 01:42.200
[indistinct chatter]

01:42.236 --> 01:43.696
- HEY, MICHAEL.
HOW YOU DOING?

01:43.737 --> 01:46.537
- MICHAEL.
OH, HI.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.544
- [laughs]

01:47.575 --> 01:49.405
STILL,
BEING THERE THAT DAY,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.413
I REALIZED HOW DIFFERENT
MEN AND WOMEN ARE,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.175
AND I DON'T THINK
IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO

01:53.214 --> 01:54.584
WITH BEING GAY
OR STRAIGHT.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.575
IT'S THAT,
THE WAY I SEE IT,

01:56.617 --> 01:58.247
WOMEN KNOW HOW TO COMMIT
TO EACH OTHER.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.586
MEN DON'T.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.520
AT LEAST NOT THE MEN
I KNOW.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.226
- HEY, MIKEY.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.459
- YEAH.
- HOW YOU BEEN?

02:06.494 --> 02:10.304
- BUT I'M JUMPING AHEAD.
LET'S GO BACK AN HOUR.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.769
[music rewinding]

02:19.873 --> 02:22.483
- [breathing heavy]

02:22.510 --> 02:25.810
I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT GOING
TO THE MUNCHERS' BRUNCH.

02:25.846 --> 02:26.806
[weights clatter]

02:26.847 --> 02:28.847
AND THAT'S FINAL.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.292
- LOOK, IT'S NOT FOR THEM.
IT'S FOR YOUR SON.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.660
- MY SON?

02:34.688 --> 02:37.258
HE'S ONLY MY SON
WHEN THEY WANT MY MONEY.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.361
- SO WHY PUNISH HIM
BY NOT GOING?

02:39.393 --> 02:41.533
- LOOK, IT'S NOT AS IF HE'S
GOING TO KNOW I'M NOT THERE.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.362
- YOU CAN'T BE SURE.
I READ SOMEPLACE...

02:43.397 --> 02:44.497
- WHERE,
MARVEL COMICS?

02:44.532 --> 02:45.702
- THAT INFANTS
RESPOND TO THINGS,

02:45.733 --> 02:46.873
EVEN WHEN STILL
IN THE WOMB.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.240
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,

02:49.270 --> 02:51.970
TENSION AND DISCORD
AFFECT THEM ADVERSELY,

02:52.005 --> 02:53.635
WHILE PLAYING MOZART
AND STUFF LIKE THAT

02:53.674 --> 02:54.744
MAKES THEM SUPER-SMART.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.335
- [laughs]

02:56.377 --> 02:57.907
WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK
LISTENING TO THE SOUND

02:57.945 --> 02:59.405
OF TWO DYKES
GO DOWN ON EACH OTHER

02:59.447 --> 03:01.247
FOR THE PAST NINE MONTHS
HAS AFFECTED HIM?

03:01.282 --> 03:02.722
CHRIST.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.420
HE'LL PROBABLY GROW UP
TO BE STRAIGHT.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.622
- ALL THE MORE REASON
WHY HE NEEDS HIS DAD.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.886
STOP ACTING LIKE A--

03:11.925 --> 03:13.325
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

03:13.361 --> 03:16.701
LIKE A CHILD AND--

03:16.730 --> 03:18.470
BRIAN?

03:18.499 --> 03:22.569
JESUS CHRIST, IT'S, LIKE,
150 FUCKING DEGREES IN HERE.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.753
THERE YOU ARE.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.983
- WHAT?

03:36.016 --> 03:36.916
- WELL,
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY

03:36.950 --> 03:38.920
I THINK YOU SHOULD
RISE TO THE OCCASION,

03:38.952 --> 03:40.952
YOU KNOW,
BE BIGGER THAN THEY ARE.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.588
THAT IS, IF YOU CAN
TAKE YOUR HAND AND YOUR MIND

03:42.623 --> 03:43.893
OFF YOUR DICK
LONG ENOUGH.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.264
JESUS!

03:45.293 --> 03:48.363
- I-I'VE GOT
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.326
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
GET OUT OF HERE

03:50.364 --> 03:51.534
BEFORE YOUR MOUSSE MELTS?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.735
- AND IF ANYBODY
SHOULD ASK WHERE YOU ARE?

03:54.768 --> 03:57.738
- JUST TELL THEM THE USUAL.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.839
SOMETHING CAME UP.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.547
- HE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE--
- SMILE.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.050
- HEY!
- HI!

04:09.082 --> 04:11.622
- OH, THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.822
AUNT SHIRLEY,
SAY SOMETHING.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.464
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.529
- [laughs]

04:18.559 --> 04:21.059
- I'M THRILLED
FOR YOU BOTH.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.504
AND SUCH A LUCKY BOY
TO HAVE TWO MOTHERS.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.502
WHAT'S HE NEED A FATHER
FOR ANYWAY?

04:26.534 --> 04:28.604
YOUR UNCLE BEN
WAS A LOUSY FATHER.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.536
NEVER HAD ANY TIME
FOR THE FAMILY,

04:30.571 --> 04:32.741
ALWAYS CHASING WOMEN.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.913
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
BEING LESBIANS BECAUSE--

04:35.943 --> 04:37.313
WELL, TAKE IT FROM ME--

04:37.345 --> 04:39.505
A STIFF PRICK
KNOWS NO CONSCIENCE.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.917
- [laughs]
OH, GOD!

04:41.949 --> 04:44.949
[laughter]

04:44.985 --> 04:49.055
- ISN'T HE GORGEOUS?
HIS NAME'S KATSUO.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.319
- JEWS?

04:50.358 --> 04:52.588
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, JEWS.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.826
JUICE. OKAY?

04:55.863 --> 04:58.633
HE GIVES "PACIFIC RIM"
A WHOLE NEW MEANING.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.566
- WHERE'D YOU FIND HIM?
- HE FOUND ME.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.341
I WAS HAVING DRINKS
IN THE LIZARD LOUNGE,

05:02.370 --> 05:03.970
HE COMES OVER,
STARTS CHATTERING AWAY.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.644
ONLY HE DOESN'T SPEAK
ANY ENGLISH,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.943
AND THE ONLY JAPANESE I KNOW
IS "SONY" AND "TOYOTA."

05:07.975 --> 05:09.805
- SO HOW DO YOU
COMMUNICATE WITH HIM?

05:09.843 --> 05:11.953
- THERE'S OTHER WAYS
THAN TALKING.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.879
- WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT POLITE
TO TALK WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.824
- OH.
- HMM.

05:15.849 --> 05:20.519
- [speaking Japanese]

05:20.554 --> 05:22.424
- IT'S CALLED CORNED BEEF,
SWEETIE.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.586
IT'S A JEWISH DELICACY.
OKAY?

05:24.625 --> 05:27.355
- WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
HE'S ACTUALLY SAYING?

05:27.395 --> 05:31.425
- WHAT'S IT MATTER?
WE'RE IN LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

05:31.465 --> 05:35.395
I'M GOING TO WASH
MY HANDS.

05:35.436 --> 05:40.066
- [speaking Japanese]

05:41.509 --> 05:43.109
- YEAH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO ASK MELANIE.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.383
SHE'S FLUENT IN SUSHI.
COME.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.583
COME. COME.
COME.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.884
- OKAY, HAVE A BAGEL.
- MEL.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.876
HI, MEL.
OKAY, AND CUT. GREAT.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.588
LOOK.
WE NEED YOU TO TRANSLATE.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.790
TALK TO MELANIE.

05:54.822 --> 05:59.532
MELANIE SPEAK
ALL AXIS POWERS.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.000
- [speaking Japanese]

06:04.031 --> 06:06.731
[speaking Japanese]

06:06.767 --> 06:09.697
- HE KEEPS SAYING "KANE."
- YEAH.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.667
"KANE" IS MONEY.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.614
HE'S SAYING
HE EXPECTS EMMETT TO PAY HIM.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.610
- FOR WHAT?

06:13.641 --> 06:15.711
- HE'S A GODDAMN
MALE PROSTITUTE.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.753
[snorting laugh]

06:17.778 --> 06:20.708
- OH, SHIT!

06:21.915 --> 06:24.745
- [pleading in Japanese]

06:24.785 --> 06:27.045
- KANE. KANE.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.757
- MELANIE SAYS...

06:28.789 --> 06:32.159
"KANE" MEANS...

06:33.193 --> 06:34.163
"LOVE."

06:34.194 --> 06:36.204
HE SAYS HE LOVES
YOUR VOICE.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.629
IT'S LIKE
A SILENT WIND CHIME.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.596
AND THAT YOUR SMILE
IS LIKE CHERRY BLOSSOMS

06:41.635 --> 06:44.765
FLOATING
ON A STILL BREEZE.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.782
- THAT--THAT IS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING

06:50.811 --> 06:55.151
THAT ANYONE
HAS EVER SAID TO ME.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.754
- OH, HERE HE IS.
CAN I HOLD HIM?

06:59.787 --> 07:01.147
- IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR THE CEREMONY.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.618
WHERE'S BRIAN?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.956
- HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

07:04.992 --> 07:05.962
HE SAID TO TELL YOU
THAT, UH--

07:05.993 --> 07:07.803
- SOMETHING CAME UP.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.528
[scoffs]
I CAN GUESS WHAT.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.534
- SHALL WE BEGIN?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.795
- THIS IS RABBI PROTESH.
HE'LL BE DOING THE BRIS.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.074
- OH, I LOVE POT ROAST.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.242
- [laughs]

07:16.269 --> 07:18.009
- THAT'S BRISKET.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.068
I BELIEVE,
IN THE JEWISH FAITH,

07:19.106 --> 07:21.036
THE BRIS
IS A CIRCUMCISION CEREMONY.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.044
- THAT'S CORRECT.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.235
- FIRST, I GIVE THE BOY CHILD
A LITTLE WINE.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.047
THEN,
I SAY A PRAYER OR TWO.

07:26.079 --> 07:30.549
THEN, I TAKE MY SCALPEL,
AND I REMOVE HIS FORESKIN.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.854
[thud]
- [gasps]

07:38.125 --> 07:40.255
- HE SAID
THAT'S ALL I WAS TO HIM,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.633
JUST A FUCK.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.263
- THAT'S A SHITTY THING
TO SAY.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.797
- AND THAT HE DOESN'T
WANT TO SEE ME ANYMORE.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.235
- WHEN MY LAST BOYFRIEND
DUMPED ME,

07:49.269 --> 07:51.739
I DIDN'T HANG AROUND
FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.712
I WENT OUT
AND GOT A NEW ONE.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.181
- WHEN DID YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
THIRD GRADE?

07:56.209 --> 07:58.179
- LAST SUMMER.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.511
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.917
- I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.249
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
HOW JEALOUS HE GOT.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.024
YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING.
SHOW THAT BRIAN.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.664
GO BACK DOWN THERE
TONIGHT.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.059
PICK UP SOME HOT,
HUNKY GUY.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.661
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY A TROLL,
YOU KNOW?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.955
- WOULD YOU COME WITH ME?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.997
- WHAT IF SOME LESBO
TRIES TO PICK ME UP?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.902
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.104
ALTHOUGH I LIKE
MELISSA ETHERIDGE A LOT.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.707
THINK THAT MEANS ANYTHING?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.679
- MAYBE.
- JESUS.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.578
[laughter]

08:32.580 --> 08:33.409
- WHAT IF HE
HAD A HEART ATTACK?

08:33.446 --> 08:34.405
I MEAN, I READ SOMEPLACE
THAT SOMETIMES

08:34.447 --> 08:36.147
PEOPLE HAVE WEAK HEARTS,
AND THEY DON'T KNOW--

08:36.183 --> 08:37.183
- HE JUST FAINTED.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.017
- LET ME THROUGH.
I'M A DOCTOR.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.792
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT FAINTING?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.561
YOU'RE A RETIRED PODIATRIST.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.590
- WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK ANYONE
EVER FAINTED IN MY OFFICE?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.185
- FROM A CORN?
- AH, JUST STAND BACK.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.696
GIVE HIM SOME ROOM.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.328
HAS ANYBODY GOT ANY, UH,
SMELLING SALTS?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.162
- HOW ABOUT POPPERS?
- WHAT ABOUT HORSERADISH?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.168
WE HAVE SOME
FOR THE GEFILTE FISH.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.970
- IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.170
- [inhales sharply]

09:01.208 --> 09:02.878
[all gasp]

09:02.910 --> 09:04.610
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.645
- YOU FAINTED.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.350
- ESTELLE, GET SOME ICE.
PUT IT ON HIS FOREHEAD.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.791
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.089
- I DON'T MEAN
TO HURRY THINGS ALONG, BUT...

09:14.121 --> 09:17.091
I'M DOING TWINS AT 3:00.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.798
- NO, I'LL BE FINE.
REALLY.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.071
- [speaking Japanese]

09:26.099 --> 09:28.199
[indistinct chatter]

09:28.235 --> 09:30.195
- HEY.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.937
CALL ME SOMETIME, HUH?

09:31.972 --> 09:34.942
- SURE...BUDDY.

09:34.975 --> 09:38.905
[phone ringing]

09:40.413 --> 09:42.023
HOW'S THE PARTY?

09:42.049 --> 09:44.149
- YOU BETTER GET YOUR ASS
OVER HERE FAST.

09:44.184 --> 09:44.954
- WHY?

09:44.985 --> 09:46.245
WITH ALL THOSE BULL DYKES
AROUND,

09:46.286 --> 09:47.316
IS THERE A SHORTAGE
OF BOTTOMS?

09:47.354 --> 09:49.324
- NO--REMEMBER LINDSAY
AND MELANIE'S INVITATION?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.356
THE PART THAT WAS IN HEBREW?

09:50.390 --> 09:52.690
I JUST FOUND OUT
WHAT THAT MEANS.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.956
- IN EVERY JEWISH BOY'S LIFE,

09:54.995 --> 09:57.725
THERE ARE THREE STEPS
TO BECOMING A MAN.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.695
FIRST, HIS BRIS.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.643
THEN, HIS BAR MITZVAH.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.399
AND FINALLY,
HIS MARRIAGE.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.766
FOR 3,500 YEARS,
THE CIRCUMCISION RITUAL

10:06.807 --> 10:08.707
HAS BEEN
THE FUNDAMENTAL SIGN

10:08.742 --> 10:12.412
OF THE COVENANT
BETWEEN GOD AND ISRAEL.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.305
MELANIE, WILL YOU PLEASE
PLACE YOUR SON

10:14.347 --> 10:17.277
ON HIS MOTHER'S LAP?

10:29.897 --> 10:31.027
- OH MY GOD,
HE'S REALLY GOING TO DO IT.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.774
OKAY, I-I CAN'T--
- WHERE'S BRIAN?

10:33.801 --> 10:37.141
- LOOKING AFTER THE ONLY DICK
THAT MATTERS--HIS OWN.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.372
- EXCUSE ME, RABBI.

10:41.408 --> 10:45.278
YOU TWO,
IN THE KITCHEN...

10:45.312 --> 10:46.712
NOW!

10:46.747 --> 10:48.747
- [sighs]

10:48.782 --> 10:50.452
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.253
BARGING IN HERE, INTERRUPTING
A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.786
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED MY PERMISSION FIRST.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.462
- FOR WHAT?
- TO CIRCUMCISE MY SON.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.989
- WE DON'T HAVE TO ASK
YOUR PERMISSION.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.025
WE'RE THE PARENTS.

10:59.059 --> 10:59.959
- AND I'M
THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.433
AND THAT GIVES ME
MORE RIGHTS THAN YOU.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.131
- OH-HO, I SEE SOMEONE'S
BEEN STUDYING HIS LAW.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.974
- NO, THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.299
WITH A HOUSE FULL OF GUESTS...
- YEAH, AND SINCE WHEN

11:07.334 --> 11:08.974
DID YOU START
CARING ABOUT YOUR SON,

11:09.002 --> 11:10.442
CONSIDERING YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN TO SEE HIM ONCE

11:10.470 --> 11:11.440
SINCE HE WAS BORN?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.841
- WELL, I'M NOT
EXACTLY WELCOME.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.013
- OH, BULLSHIT,
YOU'VE BEEN TOO BUSY

11:14.041 --> 11:15.311
FUCKING EVERYTHING
THAT MOVES!

11:15.342 --> 11:18.912
- CAN WE PLEASE STOP THIS?
- [sighs]

11:18.946 --> 11:21.306
- WHY DOES IT MATTER TO YOU
IF GUS IS CIRCUMCISED?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.378
- IT MATTERS THAT HE'S BEEN
IN THIS WORLD LESS THAN A WEEK,

11:23.416 --> 11:25.146
AND ALREADY THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO WON'T ACCEPT HIM

11:25.185 --> 11:26.115
FOR THE WAY HE IS,

11:26.153 --> 11:28.193
WHO'D EVEN MUTILATE HIM
RATHER THAN LET HIM

11:28.221 --> 11:31.691
BE THE WAY HE IS,
THE WAY HE WAS BORN.

11:33.293 --> 11:37.463
WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.397
- EXCUSE ME.

11:39.432 --> 11:43.372
UH, SHALL WE PROCEED?

11:44.972 --> 11:46.442
[indistinct chatter]

11:46.473 --> 11:49.443
[electronic music]

11:49.476 --> 11:51.406
*

11:51.444 --> 11:54.384
- YOU REALLY SHOWED THOSE DYKES
WHO'S GOT THE LOW HANGERS.

11:54.414 --> 11:59.154
- AND FOR ONCE, IT WAS US.
- MM-HMM.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.756
- DEB, CAN WE
GET SOME SERVICE?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.089
- KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.993
AT LEAST
UNTIL YOU'VE HAD DINNER.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.126
- I'VE ALWAYS SAID
THERE'S ONLY TWO REASONS

12:07.160 --> 12:08.230
TO BE FRIENDS
WITH LESBIANS--

12:08.261 --> 12:09.461
THEY'LL NEVER TRY
TO CONVINCE YOU

12:09.496 --> 12:11.156
THAT THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE GAY

12:11.198 --> 12:12.928
IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T
MET THE RIGHT WOMAN,

12:12.966 --> 12:14.896
AND, UH, THEY KNOW
HOW TO CHANGE A FLAT.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.935
- [laughs]

12:17.971 --> 12:20.471
- IT WASN'T ABOUT THEM.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.077
IT'S ABOUT MY SON.

12:23.110 --> 12:27.380
IF I DON'T LOOK OUT FOR HIM,
WHO WILL?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.954
- WOW.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.222
- IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
YOU MIGHT TURN OUT

12:30.250 --> 12:33.990
TO BE AN ALL RIGHT DAD
IN SPITE OF YOURSELF.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.521
TO BRIAN.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.825
- TO BRIAN.
- TO BRIAN.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.528
- OKAY, BOYS.
WHAT'LL IT BE?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.330
- NOTHING FOR ME, THANKS.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.532
- EM, HONEY,
YOU SHOULD TRY

12:43.563 --> 12:45.533
TO EAT SOME OF YOUR PROTEIN
OFF A PLATE.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.095
[laughter]

12:47.134 --> 12:49.944
- I READ THAT,
FOR EVERY 30 POUNDS YOU LOSE,

12:49.970 --> 12:52.410
YOU GAIN AN ENTIRE INCH
OF COCK.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.209
- SO IF YOU JUST DROP
ANOTHER 90 POUNDS,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.141
YOU'LL HAVE
A 4-INCH PECKER.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.876
[laughter]

12:57.911 --> 12:59.011
[blows kiss]

12:59.046 --> 13:00.406
WHAT ABOUT THE REST
OF YOU BOYS?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.277
- NOTHING FOR ME.
- YOU KNOW, I THINK I'LL PASS

13:02.315 --> 13:04.075
RIGHT NOW.
- TAKE A BREAK.

13:04.117 --> 13:08.357
- CHEESEBURGER, FRENCH FRY,
CHOCOLATE SHAKE, APPLE PIE.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.904
[indistinct chatter]

13:14.928 --> 13:17.558
- I JUST KNOW IT TASTES GOOD,
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.167
- OH.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.469
SORRY.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.100
- IT'S OKAY.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.935
- HEY, I KNOW THAT GUY.
HE WORKS OUT AT OUR GYM.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.971
UH, BLAKE.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.236
I THINK HE LIKES YOU.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.384
- OH, YEAH.
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.038
- 'CAUSE HE'S LOOKING BACK.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.607
- HE'S PROBABLY
JUST STRETCHING HIS NECK.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.514
- WILL YOU LISTEN TO YOU?
- WHAT?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.216
- ALWAYS PUTTING YOURSELF
DOWN.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.318
- WELL, BETTER ME THAN THEM.
I'M GENTLER.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.051
- DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.988
YOU KNOW, IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT SOMEONE

13:43.023 --> 13:44.463
COULD ACTUALLY LIKE YOU,
YOU KNOW?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.591
- YEAH, IT'S POSSIBLE.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.926
HOWEVER, I'M SURE
A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

13:48.962 --> 13:50.502
WOULD REVEAL
THAT THE PROBABILITY

13:50.530 --> 13:53.130
OF A GUY NAMED BLAKE,
WHO LOOKS LIKE THAT,

13:53.166 --> 13:56.636
ACTUALLY LIKING A GUY NAMED TED,
WHO LOOKS LIKE ME,

13:56.669 --> 14:01.409
TO BE
IN THE .05 PERCENTILE.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.041
IN OTHER WORDS,
PRACTICALLY ZIP.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.207
ANYWAY, I'M SURE
BRIAN'S MORE HIS TYPE.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.606
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

14:07.647 --> 14:09.877
- BECAUSE BRIAN'S
EVERYBODY'S TYPE,

14:09.917 --> 14:11.347
WHICH EXPLAINS
WHY HE'S HAD EVERYBODY.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.354
- WELL--
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.985
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.291
WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.163
- WEIRD? HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
- SO?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.532
- SO EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU DON'T
HAVE SEX WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.131
- OH, RIGHT.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.533
YEAH, SEX IS SOMETHING
YOU ONLY HAVE

14:24.564 --> 14:26.534
WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS,
YEAH.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.496
PEOPLE YOU'LL
NEVER SEE AGAIN,

14:27.534 --> 14:28.744
UNLESS YOU JUST BUMP
INTO THEM ON THE STREET,

14:28.768 --> 14:33.538
BUT NEVER WITH SOMEONE YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY GIVE A SHIT ABOUT.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.445
WHO MADE UP
THESE CRAZY RULES ANYWAY, HUH?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.248
- BEATS ME.
LET'S GO HAVE A DRINK.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.380
- YEAH, OR TWO OR THREE.
- YEAH.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.647
HEY.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.145
- YOU THINK
I'D LOOK GOOD IN THAT?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.157
- EH...

14:51.091 --> 14:53.261
- OH, MY GOD!
LOOK AT THAT.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.963
IS IT A GIRL OR A BOY?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.325
- JESUS, DON'T POINT.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.973
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.098
GUYS KISSING GUYS,
GIRLS KISSING GIRLS.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.674
- WELL, WHAT IF I SEE A GUY
AND A GIRL KISSING, HUH?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.943
THAT'D BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
DOWN HERE.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.113
AND STOP ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE SO EXPERIENCED.

15:08.141 --> 15:11.281
- [scoffs]
MORE THAN YOU.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.951
DON'T FORGET WHAT I SAID.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.380
- IF I SEE HIM,
PRETEND I DIDN'T.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.654
- DON'T EVEN LOOK.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.552
THAT IS, IF HE'S THERE,
WHICH HE'S PROBABLY NOT.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.554
BUT IF HE IS,
DON'T LOOK.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.960
- SHOULD I FREEZE THIS
OR TOSS IT?

15:25.993 --> 15:27.293
I'D RATHER NOT
HAVE IT AROUND

15:27.327 --> 15:30.997
WHEN I'M TRYING
TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.697
SO HOW LONG IS THIS
GOING TO GO ON?

15:35.735 --> 15:37.595
OR DO YOU PLAN
NEVER TO SPEAK TO ME EVER AGAIN?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.737
- WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO SAY?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.572
- ANYTHING.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.078
HOW ABOUT, "I HAVE A HOUSE
FULL OF UNEATEN COLD CUTS

15:44.111 --> 15:45.481
AND AN UNCIRCUMCISED SON."

15:45.512 --> 15:49.222
HOW'S THAT?

15:49.249 --> 15:50.319
- [groans]

15:50.350 --> 15:52.120
LOOK, BRIAN'S
GOING TO TAKE OUT

15:52.152 --> 15:53.292
THE INSURANCE POLICY.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.450
AT LEAST HE'S AGREED
TO DO THAT.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.457
THAT'S SOMETHING,
ISN'T IT?

15:55.488 --> 15:57.118
- OH, MY CONSOLATION PRIZE.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.727
- WELL, IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH
TO YOU LAST WEEK.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.558
- SO WAS THIS AFTERNOON,
BUT NOW I HAVE BEEN HUMILIATED

16:01.594 --> 16:04.434
IN FRONT OF OUR FRIENDS,
MY RELATIVES, RABBI PROTESH.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.074
WHERE'S THE GODDAMN
PLASTIC WRAP?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.470
AND YOU LET HIM DO IT.
- ME?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.402
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DECIDED
TO CALL OFF THE BRIS.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.768
OF COURSE, I KNOW IT'S NOT
VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU OR BRIAN,

16:13.806 --> 16:15.376
BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE
A VERY IMPORTANT RITUAL

16:15.408 --> 16:16.478
IN MY FAMILY.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.679
- YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE A LOT OF MEN

16:17.710 --> 16:20.210
WHO THINK CIRCUMCISION IS
A CRUEL AND BARBARIC PRACTICE?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.747
- I DON'T CARE WHAT MEN
THINK ABOUT THEIR DICKS.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.622
I CARE THAT YOU
PUT BRIAN BEFORE ME.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.751
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHY SHOULD I BE SURPRISED?

16:25.785 --> 16:26.745
YOU ALWAYS HAVE.

16:26.786 --> 16:27.786
- OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.360
ARE WE REALLY GOING
TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.119
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.088
- YEAH,
AND I DIDN'T WANT BRIAN

16:32.125 --> 16:34.225
TO BE THE BABY'S FATHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

16:34.261 --> 16:35.701
BUT, NO, YOU HAD
TO HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.428
IT HAD TO BE BRIAN
OR NO ONE.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.504
SO NOW HE'S A PART
OF OUR LIVES FOREVER,

16:39.532 --> 16:42.402
WHETHER WE
LIKE IT OR NOT.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.254
- OKAY.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.220
WELL, I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING TONIGHT.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.690
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF YOU?

16:59.719 --> 17:03.159
[indistinct chatter]

17:03.190 --> 17:04.819
- OH, SHIT!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.186
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.056
- MY MOM'S HERE
WITH MY UNCLE VIC.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.494
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE WAS GOING TO COME HERE.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.800
- HEY, NOT EVERY BOY'S
LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A MOTHER

17:12.832 --> 17:14.531
WHO'S EQUALLY AT HOME
IN THE KITCHEN

17:14.567 --> 17:16.537
AS SHE IS IN A GAY BAR.

17:16.569 --> 17:20.169
- [sighs]
- NOW YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.713
- AS USUAL, BRIAN
GETS ALL THE BEAUTIES

17:25.744 --> 17:27.305
WHILE WE GET TO WATCH.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.417
- HE HASN'T GOTTEN HIM YET.
- HE WILL.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.290
HE'S GOT THE WALK,
HE'S GOT THE TALK.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.689
HE'S GOT THE TATTOO.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.791
- BRIAN'S GOT A TA--
WHERE'S BRIAN GOT A TATTOO?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.733
- IN A PLACE
YOU'LL NEVER SEE.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.101
- DOUBLE SHIT!
- WHAT NOW?

17:47.134 --> 17:49.774
- IT'S HIM.
OUR TEEN STALKER.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.672
CHRIST,
WHY WON'T HE JUST GO AWAY?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.505
- REMEMBER ME?

17:54.541 --> 17:57.581
- TURN AROUND.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.210
I NEVER FORGET A BUTT,
ESPECIALLY A CUTE ONE.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.848
[laughter]

18:03.883 --> 18:06.123
I MET YOU IN THE DINER
WITH MICHAEL LAST WEEK.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.723
- YEAH. I'M JUSTIN.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.864
THIS IS DAPHNE.
- HI.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.189
- HI, DAPHNE.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.194
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.585
- TALKING TO YOUR MOM.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.726
- WHAT?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.161
- WHOO-HOO!

18:19.666 --> 18:22.736
- YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING
FOR A FRIEND OF MICHAEL'S.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.199
HIS NAME'S BRIAN.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.337
- COULD'VE GUESSED THAT.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.712
- HONEY, EVERYBODY'S
LOOKING FOR BRIAN.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.340
- HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.106
- [clicks tongue]

18:32.445 --> 18:34.245
- THAT'S BRIAN?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.651
GOD, HE'S SO OLD!

18:36.683 --> 18:38.453
AND SKINNY!

18:38.485 --> 18:39.745
AND YOU COULD DO
WAY BETTER THAN THAT.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.216
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

18:41.254 --> 18:43.464
- 5 BUCKS HE NAILS HIM
BEFORE MIDNIGHT?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.290
- YOU'RE ON.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.685
- I AM NOT
BABY-SITTING HIM AGAIN.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.356
THIS TIME,
HE'S ALL YOURS.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.295
- WHAT?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.429
- HE'S OVER THERE
TALKING TO MY MOTHER,

18:51.464 --> 18:53.734
THE LITTLE PRICK!

18:53.766 --> 18:57.196
- LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.507
- EXCUSE ME?

18:58.538 --> 18:59.438
THE NOISE
IS SO LOUD IN HERE,

18:59.472 --> 19:01.672
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.238
- IN FACT...

19:04.277 --> 19:06.247
HE'S KIND OF SWEET.
- SWEET?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.609
I THOUGHT
WE GOT RID OF HIM.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.217
I THOUGHT HE WAS
OUT OF OUR LIVES.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.251
- WHERE'D HE GO?
- WHO?

19:13.286 --> 19:15.516
- WHO DO YOU THINK?

19:15.555 --> 19:17.615
SHIT. HE'S GONE.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.757
AND THIS IS
ALL YOUR FAULT.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.761
YOU MADE ME LOOK AWAY.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.203
OH, FUCK YOU, MICHAEL!

19:26.433 --> 19:28.803
- NEED A NAPKIN OVER HERE,
PLEASE.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.495
- WHAT'S EATING HIM?
OR ISN'T?

19:31.538 --> 19:32.638
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

19:32.672 --> 19:34.442
- YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.684
- WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO COME HERE?

19:35.708 --> 19:38.348
- WELL, VIC WAS FEELING BETTER,
SO WE THOUGHT

19:38.378 --> 19:39.648
WE'D COME AFTER MY SHIFT
AND HAVE A DRINK.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.579
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

19:40.613 --> 19:42.323
- THE BIG DEAL
IS I CAME HERE TO HANG OUT

19:42.349 --> 19:43.879
WITH MY FRIENDS,
NOT MY MOTHER!

19:43.916 --> 19:46.886
- SWEETIE, YOU KNOW
I APPROVE OF YOUR LIFESTYLE.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.659
- MAYBE I DON'T WANT YOU
TO APPROVE.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.328
MAYBE I WANT YOU
TO GO HOME AND CRY.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.404
[brakes screeching,
horn honks]

20:00.733 --> 20:03.203
- COME ON!

20:10.277 --> 20:11.807
- FUCK ME.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.254
- LOVE TO.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.752
- NO, CAN'T WE
DO SOMETHING ELSE?

20:17.784 --> 20:20.694
MIKE?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.890
- TRACY!

20:22.922 --> 20:25.332
- IT IS YOU!
[giggling]

20:25.358 --> 20:26.588
ISN'T THIS WILD?

20:26.626 --> 20:28.456
- YEAH. REALLY WILD.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.755
- OH, MY FRIENDS AND I,

20:29.796 --> 20:30.756
WE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE
A LITTLE ADVENTURE.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.367
- HEY.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.629
- I MEAN YOU ALWAYS HEAR
ABOUT THIS PLACE,

20:33.666 --> 20:35.026
BUT WHO EVER COMES HERE?

20:35.067 --> 20:38.337
- NOT ME.
[chuckles]

20:38.371 --> 20:40.671
- UNTIL TONIGHT.
I MEAN, I'M HERE WITH A FRIEND.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.807
YOU KNOW, A GAY FRIEND.
YOU KNOW, JUST A FRIEND.

20:42.842 --> 20:43.842
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL,
ACTUALLY.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.776
WE HAVE THIS KIND OF
FOREIGN EXCHANGE PROGRAM.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.582
YOU KNOW, I TAKE HIM TO
FOOTBALL GAMES AND BEER BUSTS,

20:48.615 --> 20:52.315
AND HE TAKES ME TO THE OPERA
AND WINE TASTING.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.192
- [laughs]
- YEAH.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.419
- SO WHY DON'T WE ALL
GO FOR A DRINK?

20:55.455 --> 20:57.885
SAFETY IN NUMBERS.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.464
- I-I, UH...
I'M A LITTLE BEAT.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.034
I WAS ON MY WAY HOME.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.932
- OH, WELL,
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.925
YOU KNOW,
STICK AROUND HERE TOO LONG,

21:07.967 --> 21:09.997
YOU MIGHT WIND UP
SWITCHING TEAMS!

21:10.036 --> 21:11.896
- [forced laugh]

21:11.938 --> 21:13.608
- I LOST HIM.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.940
FUCK!

21:15.975 --> 21:17.905
- THIS IS MY FRIEND, BRIAN.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.054
BRIAN, THIS IS TRACY...

21:20.079 --> 21:22.649
UH, YOU KNOW...

21:22.682 --> 21:25.752
FROM THE STORE.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.055
- TRACY.
OF COURSE, FROM THE STORE.

21:29.088 --> 21:32.488
HE TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.425
- HE DOES?

21:34.461 --> 21:36.061
- I MEAN, ALL THE TIME.
- OKAY!

21:36.095 --> 21:37.055
[chuckles]
TIME TO GO.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.566
- WHAT'S THE RUSH?

21:38.598 --> 21:40.998
SHE'S EVEN PRETTIER
THAN YOU SAID.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.473
MIKE!

21:42.502 --> 21:44.742
YOU KNOW, HE'D NEVER
TELL YOU THIS HIMSELF--

21:44.771 --> 21:47.741
HE'S FAR TOO SHY.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.084
HE LIKES YOU...

21:50.109 --> 21:51.779
A LOT.
- WELL, UH...

21:51.811 --> 21:52.881
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE TOOK OFF.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.652
UH, BYE, TRACY.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.951
I'LL JUST SEE YOU MONDAY.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.622
- YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
MONDAY.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.550
- WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

22:00.587 --> 22:02.587
YOU PRACTICALLY
GOT US ENGAGED.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.792
- WELL, I WANT TO DANCE
WITH THE BRIDE AT HER WEDDING.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.764
[slaps butt]

22:06.793 --> 22:07.963
AND TRACY TOO.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.104
- [groans]
SHIT.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.059
- BY THE WAY,
WHERE'D MICHAEL GO?

22:12.098 --> 22:14.898
- WHAT TIME IS IT?
11:00.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.544
- TIME FOR BABYLON.
NIGHT'S JUST STARTING.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.370
- WELL, THAT'S JUST
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.506
- YOU'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE?
- SURE.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.111
A LOT.
- REALLY?

22:23.142 --> 22:25.452
I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY HAD KIDDIE MEMBERSHIPS.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.508
- YOU HAVE TO BE A MEMBER?

22:26.546 --> 22:29.716
- CAN'T GET IN
WITHOUT A CARD.

22:29.749 --> 22:30.719
- [sighs]

22:30.750 --> 22:32.050
- HERE.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.724
YOU CAN HAVE MINE.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.894
I'M THROUGH WITH IT.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.063
- HE'S PAID HIS DUES.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.691
- THANKS!

22:40.727 --> 22:42.087
[dance music, chatter]

22:42.128 --> 22:45.058
- I.D.?
- RIGHT HERE.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.066
- BORN 1952?

22:49.101 --> 22:51.501
YOU LOOK DAMN GOOD
FOR YOUR AGE, VIC.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.508
[dance music]

22:54.541 --> 23:02.551
*

23:19.766 --> 23:21.166
- YOU WANNA GO?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.440
- WHAT FOR?

23:23.470 --> 23:26.570
WE JUST GOT HERE.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.576
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

23:29.609 --> 23:37.119
*

23:44.557 --> 23:45.557
- OH!

23:45.592 --> 23:47.892
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO GO?

23:47.927 --> 23:50.097
- FIND A SCAT QUEEN.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.699
- GROSS.

23:52.732 --> 23:56.702
- DIDN'T YOUR MOM EVER
TEACH YOU TO WASH YOUR HANDS?

24:03.175 --> 24:04.975
[snorting]

24:05.011 --> 24:09.051
[grunts]

24:09.081 --> 24:11.581
CAREFUL, IT'S STRONG.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.088
- [inhales deeply]

24:14.120 --> 24:17.090
[laughs]
NICE.

24:19.526 --> 24:22.556
- I GOT IT
FROM TOMMY HAGGER.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.755
- HE CAN GET ANYTHING.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.227
HE GOT ME THAT SUPERMAN EPISODE
WITH GEORGE REEVES,

24:27.266 --> 24:29.866
THE ONLY ONE
EVER SHOT IN COLOR.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.872
IT'S SO ANCIENT,
YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE STRINGS.

24:33.906 --> 24:37.876
OH, DID I TELL YOU
WHAT I GOT ON EBAY?

24:37.910 --> 24:41.950
A VINTAGE MEGO LYNDA CARTER
WONDER WOMAN DOLL.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.081
MINT, IN BOX.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.617
IT COST ME
AN ENTIRE WEEK'S SALARY,

24:46.653 --> 24:48.053
BUT IT WAS SO WORTH IT.

24:48.087 --> 24:51.217
[both chuckle]

24:51.257 --> 24:54.057
- MIKEY,
YOU ARE SO PATHETIC.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.963
[chuckles]

24:56.996 --> 24:59.866
- I ALSO GOT THAT PHOTO.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.769
THE ONE OF PATRICK SWAYZE
WITH HIS SHIRT OFF.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.002
- REALLY?

25:05.037 --> 25:06.707
IT MUST BE ALL YELLOW
BY NOW,

25:06.739 --> 25:10.139
CUM STAINS ALL OVER IT.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.306
- HE'S STILL BEAUTIFUL.

25:12.344 --> 25:16.884
- WE OWE IT ALL TO HIM.
[chuckles]

25:16.916 --> 25:18.276
WE SHOULD WRITE HIM
A FAN LETTER.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.887
- I DID.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.821
- NO.
- [laughs]

25:23.856 --> 25:25.626
- REALLY? WHEN?

25:25.658 --> 25:28.058
- A LONG TIME AGO.
[laughs]

25:28.094 --> 25:30.634
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

25:30.663 --> 25:32.263
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.268
"MY FRIEND AND I
THINK YOU'RE SO HOT!"

25:35.301 --> 25:36.871
HE NEVER WROTE BACK.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.273
- [laughs]

25:38.304 --> 25:40.574
FUCK HIM.

25:40.607 --> 25:43.577
YOU STILL GOT ME.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.102
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:04.130 --> 26:06.170
- [laughs]
NOTHING.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.138
IT MUST BE
THE TRAIL MIX.

26:10.970 --> 26:14.910
- YEAH. MUST BE.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.681
COME ON.
LET'S GO BACK.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.151
[dance music]

26:25.184 --> 26:28.224
*

26:28.254 --> 26:32.224
- COME ON, LET'S GO
UP THE STAIRS OVER THERE.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.858
*

26:33.893 --> 26:35.093
- LET'S CHECK OUT THE BAR.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.697
MAYBE THAT GUY
YOU MADE ME LOSE IS THERE.

26:36.729 --> 26:41.099
- I DIDN'T
MAKE YOU LOSE HIM.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.373
- TIME TO ORGANIZE
A SEARCH PARTY.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.701
- WHO'S MISSING?
- KATSUO!

26:44.737 --> 26:46.807
I WAS TALKING
TO DUNGEON MASTER DON,

26:46.839 --> 26:47.909
WHO WANTS TO MUMMIFY ME.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.710
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT
THE WORLD'S GETTING WEIRDER?

26:49.742 --> 26:52.282
ANYWAY, I TURNED AROUND,
AND HE WAS GONE.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.351
- I HAVE A FEELING
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.181
- HE DOESN'T SPEAK
A WORD OF ENGLISH.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.287
A-AND HE'S SO SWEET,
SO INNOCENT.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.190
WHAT IF
SOME COCK-HUNGRY QUEEN

27:03.222 --> 27:04.862
TRIES TO HAVE HIS WAY
WITH HIM?

27:04.891 --> 27:06.791
- I THOUGHT
YOU ALREADY DID.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.326
- HE'S AROUND SOMEWHERE.
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND HIM.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.331
- THANKS.

27:12.364 --> 27:20.314
*

27:24.276 --> 27:26.806
- TARGET SIGHTED.
ALL SYSTEMS GO.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.946
SEE YOU LATER, MIKEY.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.222
*

27:33.252 --> 27:35.862
- HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

27:35.888 --> 27:37.718
GOOD, GLAD TO HEAR IT.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.687
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

27:40.727 --> 27:43.357
AH, YOU KNOW, NO COMPLAINTS.
THANKS.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.395
HEY, HEY,
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

27:45.431 --> 27:48.431
- YEAH, I'LL TAKE A BEER.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.837
- OH, IT'S YOU.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.809
- OH, FUCK YOU!

27:54.807 --> 27:56.707
- WHAT ARE YOU ON?

27:56.743 --> 27:59.053
- NOTHING.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.918
A LITTLE OF BRIAN'S MIX.

28:02.949 --> 28:03.979
ANY LUCK?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.816
- OH, I'M HEADING
FOR AN ALL-TIME SEASON RECORD.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.363
EIGHT STRAIGHT--ACTUALLY,
MAKE THAT NOT-SO-STRAIGHT--

28:09.388 --> 28:11.388
NO-HITTERS.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.193
- * DANCE,
DANCE WITH ME *

28:14.226 --> 28:16.926
- BLAKE JUST WINKED AT YOU.

28:16.963 --> 28:20.333
- HE'S GOT SOME CRYSTAL METH
IN HIS EYE.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.796
- HE DID IT AGAIN!

28:21.834 --> 28:24.204
I TOLD YOU,
HE LIKES YOU!

28:24.236 --> 28:26.866
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO OVER
AND ASK HIM TO DANCE?

28:26.906 --> 28:28.006
- 'CAUSE HE'LL JUST SAY,
"COME BACK

28:28.040 --> 28:30.340
WHEN YOU GET A HAIR TRANSPLANT
AND SOME LIPOSUCTION."

28:30.376 --> 28:32.476
- YOU DO NOT NEED
A HAIR TRANSPLANT

28:32.511 --> 28:34.081
AND LIPOSUCTION.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.823
BESIDES, NOBODY WOULD BE
THAT CRUEL TO YOU,

28:36.849 --> 28:39.019
EXCEPT MAYBE YOURSELF.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.291
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.519
- COME ON.
IT'S TOO EARLY!

28:42.554 --> 28:43.594
- YEAH, OR TOO LATE,
DEPENDING WHICH SIDE

28:43.622 --> 28:46.962
OF THE DANCE FLOOR
YOU HAPPEN TO BE STANDING ON.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.863
- WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TRY GOING AFTER,

28:49.896 --> 28:52.426
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE...

28:52.464 --> 28:56.304
WELL, LIKE--LIKE YOU,
AND NOT SOMEONE...

28:56.335 --> 28:59.035
- YOUNG AND CUTE?
THANKS.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.371
- THAT'S NOT
HOW I MEANT IT!

29:01.407 --> 29:02.807
HELL, I SHOULD TALK.

29:02.842 --> 29:06.312
I CAN'T GET ANYBODY
INTERESTED IN ME EITHER.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.975
- YEAH, BUT YOU COULD,
IF YOU WANTED.

29:10.016 --> 29:10.976
- [sighs]

29:11.017 --> 29:15.247
- * DANCE WITH ME

29:15.287 --> 29:17.817

"TACKY LITTLE COCKSUCKER"

31:58.217 --> 31:59.547
IN JAPANESE?

WHAT "KANE" MEANS.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.227
[baby fussing]
- OH.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.303

AND THE BABY.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.102
I KNOW
YOU NEED YOUR REST.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.574

32:16.602 --> 32:20.442
- YOU WERE?
SO WAS I.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.182
JUST THINKING ABOUT
ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS I SAID.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.479
- NO, I SHOULD'VE STOOD UP
TO HIM.

32:24.510 --> 32:25.280
I SHOULD'VE.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.311
- NO, IT WAS BEST
TO BE PRACTICAL.

I MEAN, THIS WAY, GUS--

32:32.218 --> 32:36.488
MAY KEEP HIS FORESKIN
BUT STILL BE PROVIDED FOR.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.192
- LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO'S RIGHT.

32:39.225 --> 32:41.425
WE CAN'T ALLOW BRIAN
TO COME BETWEEN US,

32:41.460 --> 32:42.690
AS MUCH AS HE'D LIKE TO.

32:42.728 --> 32:43.998
- AND YOU KNOW
HE WOULD.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.200
- EVEN IF HE
IS THE FATHER,

32:45.231 --> 32:48.071
WE'RE STILL THE PARENTS.
YOU AND ME.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.670
GUS BELONGS TO US.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.212
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAD HIM.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.369
- WHY YOU HAD HIM.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.106
ASIDE FROM SAYING
"PUSH" AND "BREATHE,"

32:56.142 --> 32:58.082
I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
THAT MUCH TO DO WITH IT.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.080
- YOU HAD EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

33:01.113 --> 33:04.153
I NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD HIM
WITHOUT YOU.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.621
JUST REMEMBER THAT,

IS NOT THAT HE WAS UNFAITHFUL

33:36.848 --> 33:38.518
OR EVEN A SLUT.

33:38.550 --> 33:42.120
I MEAN,
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

33:42.154 --> 33:46.134
IT'S THAT HE SAID
HE LOVED ME.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.228
I MEAN, HE LIED TO ME!

33:48.260 --> 33:51.460
- HOW COULD HE LIE TO YOU?
HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.797
- LOOK, I'M THE ONE
WHO TOLD YOU THAT.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.773
I'M SORRY.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.238
- MY OWN FAULT.

34:02.274 --> 34:06.554
WHY DO I ALWAYS GIVE MY HEART
AWAY TO TRASH, HUH?

34:06.578 --> 34:10.447
- BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE IT
IN THE DUMPSTER?

34:10.482 --> 34:17.722
*

34:20.359 --> 34:22.489
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY
THIS TIME.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.098

IT'S A NICE PLACE.
YOU OWN IT?

34:50.522 --> 34:51.621
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

34:51.657 --> 34:55.887
YOU KNOW, YOUR HOME IS
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.427
[clears throat]
IT'S WHAT WE TELL OUR CLIENTS.

34:58.464 --> 34:59.734
DO YOU WANT A--

34:59.765 --> 35:02.395
A BEER
OR SOME SCOTCH?

35:02.434 --> 35:05.344
- NO, JUST SOME WATER.
I DON'T DRINK.

35:05.371 --> 35:06.911
- WELL, UH,
TAKE OFF YOUR JACKET.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.108
I-I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

- [sighs]

35:42.408 --> 35:45.478
YEAH...
FRANKLY, NO.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.451

35:51.383 --> 35:54.423
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
YOU ARE.

35:59.258 --> 36:03.898

YOU EVER USE IT?

37:32.718 --> 37:33.818
- ONCE IN A WHILE.
