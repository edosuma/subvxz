00:01.500 --> 00:05.061
The Heart Bled Blue
and The Heart Hit Home--

00:05.100 --> 00:06.658
your stepdad wrote these?

00:06.700 --> 00:08.236
Certainly did.

00:08.270 --> 00:10.135
Why didn't he use
his real name?

00:10.170 --> 00:12.377
Why does any thief
use an alias?

00:12.410 --> 00:15.231
He based the main characters
on me and Sherlock,

00:15.280 --> 00:16.440
and didn't ask our permission.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.708
This is supposed to be
you and Sherlock?

00:17.750 --> 00:19.570
Yeah, now you know

00:19.620 --> 00:21.178
why he didn't ask
our permission.

00:21.220 --> 00:23.040
Anyway, he learned his lesson,
and now he wants

00:23.090 --> 00:24.819
to write a more grounded book
about real cops.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.408
So he wanted to know
ifI could

00:26.460 --> 00:27.688
connect him with someone
on the force.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.812
And you thought of me.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.487
He just needs
a brain to pick.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.451
And I thought,
I don't know, you'd get

00:31.490 --> 00:32.525
a few free lunches out of it.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.096
What do you think?

00:34.130 --> 00:36.166
Well, it depends.
Am I gonna be the next one

00:36.200 --> 00:37.519
kissing your partner?

00:37.570 --> 00:39.629
You know, jot
down his info.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.365
I'll give him a
ring tomorrow.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.367
Okay.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.076
Excuse me, but...

00:48.110 --> 00:50.408
does this mean
what I think it means?

00:50.450 --> 00:53.374
If you think it means
I have a date tonight,

00:53.420 --> 00:55.240
then... yeah.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.215
Well, I thought you
were gonna wait to ask her out

00:58.250 --> 01:00.457
until her divorce was finalized.

01:00.490 --> 01:01.787
I was.

01:01.820 --> 01:03.424
And it is.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.280
Butthen
she made the first move.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.252
Tonight's actually
date number three.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.790
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.593
I didn't want to jinx anything.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.336
Speaking of which,

01:13.370 --> 01:15.338
I should probably
get going.

01:15.370 --> 01:17.634
I'll let you know when I've
touched base with your stepdad.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.604
Okay, but I better know
the details

01:19.640 --> 01:22.200
about your new girlfriend
before he does.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.502
(clicks tongue)

01:24.550 --> 01:28.338
* I don't wanna take
no trip now... *
(phone ringing)

01:28.380 --> 01:30.109
You're five minutes away,

01:30.150 --> 01:32.289
and you want me
to order you a Merlot.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.185
Actually,
I'm not five minutes away,

01:34.220 --> 01:36.279
but I would kill for a drink.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.127
Everything okay?

01:38.160 --> 01:40.594
Yeah, you know how we're making
that big discovery push

01:40.630 --> 01:42.495
on the Pulaski case?

01:42.530 --> 01:43.519
The homicide, yeah.

01:43.570 --> 01:44.423
Well, the defense just hit us

01:44.470 --> 01:45.698
with a document dump.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.459
I'm gonna have
to comb through this

01:47.500 --> 01:49.161
all night
if I'm gonna make my deadline.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.531
Well, that's the life
of a superstar ADA, right?

01:51.570 --> 01:54.300
Well, I don't know
about superstar, but...

01:54.340 --> 01:55.500
(chuckles):
yeah.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.371
This is the life.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.809
Can I get a rain check?

01:58.850 --> 02:00.215
Of course.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.569
I'll call you tomorrow.

02:01.620 --> 02:02.780
You better.

02:02.820 --> 02:06.483
*

02:08.820 --> 02:10.549
What the hell, man?

02:10.590 --> 02:12.399
I was just about to settle up.

02:12.430 --> 02:13.852
How about I buy you another one?

02:13.900 --> 02:15.891
I don't want another drink.
I want that drink.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.421
Look, man, I'm a cop.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.165
I don't want any trouble.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.509
Let's just take this down
a notch, before...

02:22.540 --> 02:24.337
Before what? You think
just 'cause you're a cop

02:24.370 --> 02:25.564
you ain't got to watch
where you're going?

02:26.580 --> 02:27.933
Hey.

02:27.980 --> 02:30.801
What? Oh, you got
something for me, cop?

02:30.850 --> 02:33.216
(panﬁng)

02:34.620 --> 02:37.214
*

02:45.790 --> 02:46.791
(branch snaps nearby)

02:46.830 --> 02:47.854
Over there!

03:02.580 --> 03:05.276
I don't see him.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.915
I thought you said
he went this way.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.524
MAN:
He did.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.721
That's his mask.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.564
That's not his mask.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.635
It's him.

03:36.710 --> 03:37.904
Oh, my God.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.441
He's dead, isn't he?

03:40.480 --> 03:43.483
Looks like someone
tried to bury him.

03:43.520 --> 03:47.479
W-We only lost him
for a second or two!

03:47.520 --> 03:49.886
How the hell did this happen?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.556
*

04:00.070 --> 04:03.562
WOMAN: Normally, I wouldn't
accept help from an outsider.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.602
It was weird, you showing up
out of the blue this morning.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.528
But this is a weird case.

04:08.580 --> 04:12.619
We don't get much murder
in Mount Pleasant,

04:12.650 --> 04:14.971
let alone
whatever this is.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.715
You're the Major Case
consultant--

04:16.750 --> 04:18.684
ever see anything like this?

04:18.720 --> 04:20.881
This is, in fact, my
third murdered clown.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.626
But that's a career spanning

04:22.660 --> 04:25.925
more than 20 years, so...
I'm hardly an expert.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.757
May I?

04:30.630 --> 04:33.394
You said you'd been reading
about us online, right?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.659
For several weeks now, a clown
matching this one's description

04:36.710 --> 04:40.737
has been skulking around
Mount Pleasant late at night.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.929
He's been observed and
photographed

04:41.980 --> 04:43.675
by a dozen citizens.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.769
Never says anything,
just stands and stares,

04:45.810 --> 04:48.472
before disappearing
back into the shadows.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.782
_ We weren't _sure if it's
just a kid playing a prank,

04:49.820 --> 04:51.845
or someone
who wanted to do real harm.

04:51.890 --> 04:54.381
Yeah. I'm sure you're aware

04:54.420 --> 04:56.081
scary clowns are
quite in at the moment.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.223
They've been observed

04:57.260 --> 05:00.593
lurking around towns and cities
all across the country.

05:00.630 --> 05:03.793
It's a phenomenon
as strange as it is stupid.

05:03.830 --> 05:07.459
I was, I was curious
when I heard this one died.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.637
Who found him?

05:08.670 --> 05:09.705
Two members
of our Citizens Patrol.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.469
They said they saw him near

05:11.510 --> 05:12.807
the middle school
around 10:00 pm.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.569
When they approached him,
he took off,

05:14.610 --> 05:17.101
made a beeline
for these woods.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.640
And yet
this couldn't possibly be

05:18.680 --> 05:20.113
the clown that was being chased.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.641
No. Westchester County ME.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.043
says he's been dead
about 36 hours.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.648
Obviously,
we haven't been dealing

05:25.690 --> 05:27.555
with one clown
the last two weeks.

05:27.590 --> 05:28.955
We've been dealing with two.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.685
Yeah, at least two.
You never know with clowns.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.494
The assailant was
right-handed, I would say.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.395
The first blow
was from behind.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.819
This one killed him.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.735
Weapon has a hook
on the end of it.

05:39.770 --> 05:40.964
Most likely a crowbar.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.867
Yeah. He doesn't look familiar?

05:44.910 --> 05:46.878
No wallet, no phone.

05:46.910 --> 05:48.878
But Mount Pleasant's
a small place.

05:48.910 --> 05:51.401
If he's one of ours,
we'll hear about it.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.839
You said the second clown made
a beeline for these woods.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.142
That's right.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.716
So, by all accounts,

05:56.750 --> 05:58.911
the clowns were stalking
Mount Pleasant, the town,

05:58.950 --> 06:00.850
this one died in the woods,

06:00.890 --> 06:02.755
the other one
ran through here, so...

06:02.790 --> 06:05.350
What's on the other side?

06:10.200 --> 06:11.792
Hey.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.129
We didn't make plans
last night that I forgot?

06:15.170 --> 06:18.731
Nope. I just need
to talk to you a minute.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.135
Sure.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.000
Come on back.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.871
So it's true.

06:25.910 --> 06:28.515
You were in a fight
at the bar last night.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.586
How did you hear
about that?

06:31.820 --> 06:33.151
Look, um...

06:35.520 --> 06:37.488
...it was just,
it was nothing.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.748
Some guy was itching to
mix it up with someone.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.199
For whatever reason,
he picked me.

06:41.230 --> 06:43.528
The bouncers broke it up
before it got serious.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.992
But you did hit him.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.964
Chantal, are you here
as my girlfriend

06:47.000 --> 06:48.661
or as an ADA?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.167
Honestly, I'm here
because I'm angry at you.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.563
At me?

06:51.610 --> 06:52.804
The guy was a jackass.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.671
He instigated the whole thing.

06:54.710 --> 06:55.529
And you took the bait.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.798
The guy you hit,
his name was Roy Booker.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.875
He came to my office
this morning and made a scene.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.774
Why would he come
to the DA's office?

07:01.820 --> 07:03.913
Because he's my ex-husband.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.926
(sighs):
Sorry, it's not me.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.757
You may be right--
after all, you are just one

07:11.790 --> 07:14.588
of the men wearing a costume
like that around Mount Pleasant.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.962
Mount Pleasant-- is that,
like, upstate or something?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.468
I just moved here
from Pittsburgh, so...

07:19.500 --> 07:20.660
Cut the crap, okay?

07:20.700 --> 07:22.839
We know you ran away
from two members

07:22.870 --> 07:24.906
of the Mount Pleasant
Citizens Patrol last night.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.476
You led them
through the woods

07:26.510 --> 07:28.728
to the Metro North station
on the other side.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.748
We know this,
because a half-costumed,

07:30.780 --> 07:32.577
heavily winded clown

07:32.620 --> 07:34.645
was seen buying a ticket
at a kiosk there,

07:34.680 --> 07:37.786
and that credit card
was traced back to you.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.617
Okay, fine, it was me.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.854
But it's not illegal to wear

07:41.890 --> 07:43.118
a scary costume in public, okay?

07:43.160 --> 07:44.650
I checked.

07:44.690 --> 07:45.918
You know what is illegal?

07:45.960 --> 07:46.949
Murder.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.194
We checked.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.094
Are these...?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.789
Are these for real?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.501
Mount Pleasant's police chief

07:56.540 --> 07:58.508
thinks he was killed
two nights ago.

07:58.540 --> 07:59.700
HOLMES:
You'll be meeting her shortly.

07:59.740 --> 08:00.934
Because you reside
in New York,

08:00.980 --> 08:02.277
she requested that the NYPD

08:02.310 --> 08:04.608
pick you up, and gave us
permission to talk to you.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.777
But after this is done,
she's gonna have some questions

08:06.820 --> 08:07.844
for you as well.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.541
No-no way, I-I didn't do this.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.581
Two nights ago I
was in Pittsburgh.

08:11.620 --> 08:12.814
I-I went to see my girlfriend.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.612
I crashed with her
and her roommates.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.013
They'll all tell you,
I didn't come back

08:16.060 --> 08:17.254
_ into New York _
until yesterday morning.

08:17.290 --> 08:18.848
Say they will.

08:18.890 --> 08:21.256
Do you have any idea
who would've done this?

08:21.300 --> 08:24.098
I mean, try anyone that
lives in Mount Pleasant.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.859
They hate us.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.266
You're talking
about you and our victim, right?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.609
H-His name was Kip.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.959
Kip Tully.

08:32.010 --> 08:32.908
We weren't buddies
or anything,

08:32.940 --> 08:35.807
but I know that he lived
in the city, too.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.001
We would both take the train
to Mount Pleasant.

08:38.050 --> 08:39.779
We would change into our
costumes in the woods

08:39.820 --> 08:41.117
and then use it as
a shortcut into town,

08:41.150 --> 08:43.015
just never on the same night.

08:43.050 --> 08:44.278
WATSON :
Walt,

08:44.320 --> 08:45.287
you took turns

08:45.320 --> 08:46.856
dressing up like a clown

08:46.890 --> 08:48.619
and creeping
around Mount Pleasant,

08:48.660 --> 08:49.888
but you weren't buddies?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.956
It was a job,
for a company called AdRupt.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.855
Have you guys ever heard
of pranlwertising?

08:55.900 --> 08:57.060
Prankver-what?

08:57.100 --> 08:59.022
I-It's like guerilla
marketing.

08:59.070 --> 09:01.664
You prank people, right?
But you do it on camera.

09:01.700 --> 09:05.204
So how does dressing up like a
scary clown help sell anything?

09:05.240 --> 09:07.003
The pictures people take of us?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.871
The videos they post?

09:08.910 --> 09:10.275
They've been going viral.

09:10.310 --> 09:11.800
It's all supposed
to help promote

09:11.850 --> 09:13.112
this horror_ movie
that's coming out

09:13.150 --> 09:15.846
in a few months, Mister Mangles.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.144
May I have a moment outside?

09:26.930 --> 09:29.353
Kip Tully doesn't exist.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.062
What do you mean?
You did a search of his name?

09:32.100 --> 09:33.590
No, I searched
for the company, AdRupt,

09:33.640 --> 09:34.891
that employed him.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.999
One of the first things
that came up was a link

09:37.040 --> 09:40.009
to an article written about
the company several months ago.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.133
Look at the byline photo.

09:42.180 --> 09:44.944
That's our dead clown.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.618
Kip Tully was
just an alias.

09:46.650 --> 09:48.845
His real name
was Dale SchmItt.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.916
Perhaps he was killed
over his reporting.

09:50.950 --> 09:54.852
No way are you cops.

09:54.890 --> 09:57.154
Wait, are you cops?

09:57.190 --> 10:00.159
No, if you're cops,
I'm a cop.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.020
The only cop here is me.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.096
But my colleagues do
consult for the department.

10:04.130 --> 10:07.190
Sorry, a lot of shenanigans
around this place.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.730
Even I get tricked sometimes.

10:08.770 --> 10:11.034
Jerry Bice.
Welcome to AdRupt.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.708
By shenanigans,
do you mean the, uh,

10:12.740 --> 10:14.230
prank that Kip Tully
played on you?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.748
_Who?
KIp Tully.

10:16.780 --> 10:18.202
He's one of the man that
your company hired to wander

10:18.250 --> 10:20.172
arou_nd Mount Pleasant
In a clown swt.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.949
If he told you that,
he's in violation

10:21.980 --> 10:23.641
of a very strict NDA.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.043
He's dead, Mr. Bice.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.182
What?

10:26.220 --> 10:27.357
HOLMES: Dead.
More specifically,

10:27.390 --> 10:28.789
murdered.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.981
Kip's real name was
Dale Schmitt.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.281
You remember
Mr. Schmitt, don't you?

10:32.330 --> 10:34.127
He wrote a very
unflattering article

10:34.160 --> 10:37.129
about your company
for a trade magazine last year.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.364
HOLMES: He claimed
that you exploit

10:38.400 --> 10:40.436
your merry band
of pranksters.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.199
Paying them under the table,
for example, to keep them off

10:42.240 --> 10:44.128
the company health plan.

10:44.170 --> 10:46.001
This, despite the fact, they're
put in dangerous situations.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.429
Dressing as
deranged harlequins,

10:48.480 --> 10:51.005
terrorizing small towns,
for example.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.041
We think Mr. Schmitt
went undercover to write

10:53.080 --> 10:54.274
a follow-up piece.
You found out

10:54.320 --> 10:56.117
and decided to get revenge

10:56.150 --> 10:58.141
for all the bad press he brought
the first time around.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.851
(stammers)

10:59.890 --> 11:01.448
You're right and you're wrong.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.287
Dale was working
on a follow-up piece,

11:03.330 --> 11:05.218
but he wasn't _unde_rcover.
I was paying hIm

11:05.260 --> 11:07.125
to write another article
about AdRupt.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.229
Explain that.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.125
It was gonna be a retraction.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.024
He was gonna work here
a few months

11:12.070 --> 11:13.469
and then say
he got us all wrong.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.229
We're on the up and up,
we treat our people well--

11:15.270 --> 11:17.761
stuff like that.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.734
You don't want to take
my word for It, take his.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.475
I wanted to see everything
he was writing as he wrote it,

11:22.510 --> 11:24.000
so we shared a cloud drive.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.075
The work he did got
uploaded automatically.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.145
I can give you the username
and password.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.249
You can see for yourself.

11:30.420 --> 11:33.787
(playing circus music)

11:33.820 --> 11:35.811
(door opens)

11:49.070 --> 11:50.503
Where the hell
did that come from?

11:50.540 --> 11:52.974
I rented it!

11:53.010 --> 11:54.875
It's help putting me
in the mindset of someone

11:54.910 --> 11:56.377
who'd want_to kill a clown.
(mu5Ic stops)

11:59.820 --> 12:02.789
Ugh. I could see how it could
drive someone to murder.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.287
If you're having
to work this hard,

12:04.320 --> 12:06.413
I'm guessing Jerry Bice isn't
looking good as a suspect.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.281
The folder that Schmitt and Bice
shared indicates

12:08.320 --> 12:10.220
they were working together.

12:10.260 --> 12:13.024
Well, if Bice isn't our killer,
why are you still reading that?

12:13.060 --> 12:14.152
Well, the folder documents
Schmitt's activities

12:14.200 --> 12:16.452
in his final days,
so there might be

12:16.500 --> 12:18.889
a lead lurking somewhere
in its pages.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.532
"Officer Roy Booker, NYPD,
retired?"

12:23.570 --> 12:26.266
Yeah, uh, remember, uh,
Chantal Milner?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.175
The ADA Marcus
was interested in?

12:28.210 --> 12:29.905
Well, they're dating now.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.373
And Booker is her ex-husband.
Something amiss?

12:32.410 --> 12:34.844
Marcus was waiting for Chantal
at a bar last night,

12:34.880 --> 12:37.280
when Booker walked in
and started a fight.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.914
So he just happened to be
in the same bar, did he?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.848
Well, it's not as suspicious
as it sounds.

12:41.890 --> 12:44.358
Booker is an ex-cop, and the bar
was near One Police Plaza

12:44.390 --> 12:45.880
and the courthouses.

12:45.930 --> 12:48.023
He claimed he was there
to meet his friends,

12:48.060 --> 12:49.823
when he recognized Marcus.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.259
The thing is he barged into
Chantal's office this morning

12:52.300 --> 12:54.291
and made a huge scene
in front of the DA.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.194
So he's not one
to let things go.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.105
And Marcus is worried
what he's gonna do next.

12:58.140 --> 12:59.232
Well, he could really
jam Marcus up.

12:59.270 --> 13:01.204
I mean, he could push
the department

13:01.240 --> 13:02.901
to take disciplinary action.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.247
I'm gonna stop by the bar.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.440
See what I can scrape up.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.118
Maybe a security video, witness.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.038
Just in case this guy
keeps causing trouble.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.157
You just spot something?

13:13.190 --> 13:16.011
It's a link to an online
Photobucket.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.482
Schmitt's phone
was never recovered.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.384
Presumably the killer took it
along with his wallet.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.295
But it seems that his phone

13:21.330 --> 13:24.128
was set to automatically
upload photographs here.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.161
The last two photos, they were
taken the night he died.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.930
You said Schmitt was
killed with a crowbar.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.404
We've got to be looking
at his killer, right?

13:31.440 --> 13:33.931
This is not the same part of the
woods Schmitt's body was found.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.231
Well, maybe
Mount Pleasant Police

13:35.280 --> 13:37.305
can round up enough people
for a grid search.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.874
That won't be necessary.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.844
There's only a few hundred
yards of roadway

13:40.880 --> 13:43.417
where you could drive a car
this deep into the woods.

13:43.450 --> 13:45.589
Shouldn't be too hard
to find the spot.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.451
Body was found, what?

13:47.490 --> 13:49.287
A few hundred yards
that way?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.288
So Schmitt saw something
he shouldn't have

13:51.330 --> 13:53.195
somewhere around here.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.323
And our perp
chased him away.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.294
Killed him.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.333
Any idea what we're looking for?

14:03.370 --> 14:05.258
Something worth killing over.

14:09.010 --> 14:10.409
Watson told me about, uh,

14:10.450 --> 14:13.317
Chantal and her
ill-tempered ex.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.875
That sounds like a lot
of unwanted drama.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.911
If this is about to turn
Into one of your

14:17.950 --> 14:19.281
down with love speeches, I...

14:19.320 --> 14:21.515
No, I mean, you remember
I once chastised you

14:21.560 --> 14:25.121
for allowing yourself
to be lonely.

14:25.160 --> 14:29.256
Honestly, at this point,
I'm more worried for Chantal.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.519
She's been prepping 24/7
for this big trial.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.128
You know about
the Pulaski murder.

14:34.170 --> 14:35.637
Myra Pulaski.

14:35.670 --> 14:37.308
She butchered her husband
of one year,

14:37.340 --> 14:39.638
inherited three quarters
of a million dollars.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.570
Her claim is self-defense,

14:41.610 --> 14:43.305
but there's no evidence
to support that.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.375
And even her own parents
say she's lying.

14:45.410 --> 14:47.241
Yeah, the DA's showing
a lot of trust

14:47.280 --> 14:50.386
giving Chantal first chair,
could be a career-maker.

14:50.420 --> 14:54.311
But after Roy's outburst
at her office,

14:54.360 --> 14:56.009
her boss is worried
her head's not in the game.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.425
He might pull her
off the case.

14:57.460 --> 15:03.467
I just, I don't want what
I did to cause her any grief.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.991
HOLMES:
This impression, you see it?

15:06.030 --> 15:09.067
I think it was made
by a large hose.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.501
Starting at the road back there.

15:12.540 --> 15:15.703
Given how hard the soil
has been due to the cold,

15:15.740 --> 15:17.241
to leave an impression
like that

15:17.280 --> 15:20.113
it would have to be
warm and heavy,

15:20.150 --> 15:23.688
for a long time.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.244
What's a manhole

15:25.290 --> 15:27.383
doing in the middle
of the woods?

15:27.420 --> 15:29.183
I don't know.

15:29.220 --> 15:33.589
Perhaps that's why our killer
had a crowbar with him.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.190
Cut through the lock here
with a blowtorch,

15:36.230 --> 15:37.424
and used it to open it.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.426
You got a set of tools
in your car, don't you?

15:40.540 --> 15:43.134
(water rushing)

15:48.310 --> 15:50.346
BELL: What do you think?
Storm sewer?

15:50.380 --> 15:52.143
I think you're close,
but you're at the wrong end

15:52.180 --> 15:53.977
of the urban cycle.

15:54.020 --> 15:58.411
We're standing directly above
part of the Catskill Aqueduct.

15:58.450 --> 16:02.079
What we see below us is
New York City's drinking water.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.535
What?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.468
I recognize that smell.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.068
That's liquid nutrient
growth medium

16:24.110 --> 16:25.668
for viruses and bacteria.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.076
And you said the hose
coming from that service road

16:28.120 --> 16:31.009
was pouring it for a long time?

16:31.050 --> 16:33.359
Dale Schmitt was killed
because he saw someone

16:33.390 --> 16:35.688
poisoning the city's water.
We should contact

16:35.720 --> 16:37.358
the Department of
Environmental Protection.

16:37.390 --> 16:39.324
New York City's drinking water
needs to be shutoff.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.588
Now.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.539
This is Special Agent David
Breslin from the Department

16:48.570 --> 16:51.767
of Homeland Security,
and this is Wendell Hecht, EVP,

16:51.810 --> 16:53.732
of Water Integrity
at the city's

16:53.780 --> 16:55.736
Department of Environmental
Protection.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.146
Gentlemen, this is Sherlock
Holmes and Joan Watson.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.772
The D.E.P. owes you
a great debt.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.641
Your warning about Mount
Pleasant came just in time.

17:01.680 --> 17:06.140
And has the threat from
the water been neutralized?

17:06.190 --> 17:08.715
Well, the tainted water
from the aqueduct

17:08.760 --> 17:12.582
had made it's way down south to
the distribution hub in Yonkers.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.495
But we were able
to seal off the valves,

17:14.530 --> 17:15.758
so none of it was able to reach

17:15.800 --> 17:17.427
the city grid.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.425
But until we are able to

17:18.470 --> 17:20.791
make that supply safe again,
we're gonna be using

17:20.840 --> 17:23.638
emergency reserves,
full capacity.

17:23.670 --> 17:26.230
It'll be a headache,

17:26.270 --> 17:27.373
but it beats
the alternative.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.139
BRESLIN: DHS is
grateful as well.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.239
But, uh, like I was just
telling your captain,

17:31.280 --> 17:33.214
this all needs to be
kept under wraps

17:33.250 --> 17:36.572
until we can coordinate an
Investigation With the FBI.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.848
The city's drinking water
was contaminated.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.585
Now it isn't.

17:39.620 --> 17:40.848
There's no need
to start a panic.

17:40.890 --> 17:43.120
Well, what about
the contaminate itself?

17:43.160 --> 17:44.229
Do we know what it was?

17:44.260 --> 17:46.080
BRESLIN:
Nothing definitive yet.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.496
Early word is it's
some sort of waterborne bug.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.327
Uh, it can't live in the air,

17:50.370 --> 17:53.464
which is why we gave the okay
to let you out of quarantine.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.297
Yeah, but it's not
all good news.

17:55.340 --> 17:59.606
I mean, this bug, or
whatever it is, it's hardy.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.131
I mean, it made it past both
of our disinfection safety nets.

18:02.180 --> 18:05.672
The chlorine treatmentand
the ultraVIolet purification.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.314
Well, isn't that a superbug?

18:07.350 --> 18:09.671
I was a surgeon and I've never
heard of a pathogen

18:09.720 --> 18:11.483
that could survive UV
and chlorine.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.885
Well--
BRESLIN:
I'm afraid we've said

18:12.920 --> 18:14.478
all we can say at the moment.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.684
Can you at least tell us who
you think is responsible?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.497
Department of Homeland Security

18:21.530 --> 18:23.191
does like its secrets.

18:23.230 --> 18:24.663
GREGSON:
Hold on.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.895
Someone drove a tanker truck
into Mount Pleasant

18:26.930 --> 18:30.559
and dumped God only knows
how many thousands

18:30.610 --> 18:32.908
of gallons of a bioweapon

18:32.940 --> 18:35.670
into New York City's
drinking water,

18:35.710 --> 18:39.168
and you're gonna keep
the NYPD in the dark?

18:39.210 --> 18:43.112
For the time being, yes, I am.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.415
(door opens)

18:53.230 --> 18:54.857
The usual suspects?

18:54.900 --> 18:58.222
Already moved off them,
actually.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.158
How was your, uh,
visit to Farlane's?

19:00.200 --> 19:01.929
Anything productive?

19:01.970 --> 19:03.608
Aside from the light buzz
you're feeling

19:03.640 --> 19:05.801
from the Belgian White, was it?

19:05.840 --> 19:08.172
I was at a bar.

19:08.210 --> 19:11.270
Seemed like a better idea
than drinking the water.

19:11.310 --> 19:12.538
The attack was thwarted, Watson.

19:12.580 --> 19:13.774
Don't let your lizard brain
run away with you.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.378
The manager gave me
the security video

19:15.420 --> 19:17.240
of the fight that Marcus was in.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.939
I still have to review it,
but I think you were right

19:18.990 --> 19:20.389
to doubt that Roy was there
by coincidence.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.648
I'm gonna talk
to talk to Chantal

19:21.690 --> 19:22.884
after I watch the video.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.182
Oh, and while I was out,

19:24.230 --> 19:26.186
I managed to meet up
with my friend

19:26.230 --> 19:27.697
at Stuyvesant Memorial.

19:27.730 --> 19:28.958
The virologist?
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.627
I gave her the glove
you were wearing

19:30.670 --> 19:33.230
when you touched the liquid
growth medium yesterday.

19:33.270 --> 19:35.864
I still don't think it was
a good idea to keep it from DHS.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.300
And?

19:38.340 --> 19:40.638
Well, she put a sample under a
scanning electron microscope.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.376
It is a virus, but not one
she's ever seen before.

19:43.410 --> 19:44.843
Well, now we've got
its mug shot,

19:44.880 --> 19:46.245
someone's gonna know what it is.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.747
She thought it was
very suspicious

19:47.780 --> 19:50.214
that it was both UV
and chlorine-resistant

19:50.250 --> 19:51.979
She cannot rule out that
it was a natural mutation,

19:52.020 --> 19:54.215
but said that_ it was far
more likely

19:54.260 --> 19:55.955
that our suspect
was lab-engineered.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.379
So someone crafted it
speCIfically to survwe

19:58.430 --> 20:00.227
the city's gauntlet
of water safeguards?

20:00.260 --> 20:02.251
Yeah.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.427
Unfortunately, there are
thousands of labs in the world

20:04.470 --> 20:06.267
that could've made it.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.234
So it doesn't exactly narrow
our suspect pool.

20:08.270 --> 20:09.760
Actually, I think it does.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.960
After Agent Breslin
shot us down,

20:11.010 --> 20:13.308
I reached out
to my sundry contacts

20:13.340 --> 20:14.602
in the intelligence community.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.403
No one heard any chatter
about the attack,

20:16.440 --> 20:17.976
before or after.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.615
Well, that doesn't prove it
couldn't be one of those groups.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.242
No, but it does suggest so.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.781
So I began to consider
the possibility

20:23.820 --> 20:26.709
that we are pursuing someone
with a more singular vision.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.684
A lone wolf, as it were.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.620
Synthesizing a superbug would
either take a lot of expertise,

20:30.660 --> 20:32.423
or a lot of money.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.429
If you're right, then there
can't be that many people

20:35.460 --> 20:38.463
who have both the desire to
poison eight million New Yorkers

20:38.500 --> 20:39.967
and the means to do it.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.389
Actually, I think I found
just such a person

20:42.440 --> 20:44.806
right here in the city.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.274
And apparently he's a
17th century Dutch explorer.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.902
No.

20:48.940 --> 20:50.373
It's his great, great, great,
eight more "greats"

20:50.410 --> 20:51.638
grandchild.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.913
BELL:
That's Gracie Van Bylandt.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.009
And, yes, she's one
of those Van Bylandts.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.450
One of the oldest and wealthiest
families in New York, yeah.

21:01.490 --> 21:03.048
Fallen on hard times
over the last century,

21:03.090 --> 21:04.557
relatively speaking.

21:04.590 --> 21:07.798
I put Gracie's net worth
in the mid eight figures.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.388
More crippling,

21:09.430 --> 21:10.692
has been her decline
into a hermetic life

21:10.730 --> 21:12.823
of agoraphobia and paranoia.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.030
She's not sounding
like someone who would

21:14.070 --> 21:16.334
infect the water supply
with a designer bug.

21:16.370 --> 21:18.907
How did she and all of
her stuff end up here?

21:18.940 --> 21:20.828
Everything you're looking at
was in plain view

21:20.880 --> 21:22.302
when we visited her apartment.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.568
He thought
we should check her out

21:23.610 --> 21:25.646
because of some
self-published manifesto

21:25.680 --> 21:26.704
she'd posted online.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.411
They're short
and uninspired

21:28.450 --> 21:30.008
as manifestos go.

21:30.050 --> 21:32.041
But they do express
Gracie's strident view

21:32.090 --> 21:34.354
that the blame
for her family's ignominy

21:34.390 --> 21:36.415
falls at the feet of, I quote,

21:36.460 --> 21:38.587
uh, "all these damn people

21:38.630 --> 21:40.552
who've moved into the city."
And they also document

21:40.600 --> 21:41.999
her search for, uh,

21:42.030 --> 21:43.895
the best way to, I quote again,

21:43.930 --> 21:45.568
"kill off the lot of them."

21:45.600 --> 21:48.398
She'd been researching
technologies that can be used

21:48.440 --> 21:50.863
for mass murder:
enVIronmental toxms,

21:50.910 --> 21:53.060
dirty bombs,
custom-made superbugs.

21:53.110 --> 21:56.102
Thing is, we found
a ton of evidence

21:56.140 --> 21:58.540
that she was interested
in an attack like this,

21:58.580 --> 22:01.617
but no evidence that
she actually took action.

22:01.650 --> 22:04.619
Meaning you don't think
she was involved?

22:04.650 --> 22:06.481
So why is she still here?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.988
Well, as part of her research,
she interacted online

22:09.020 --> 22:11.079
with a lot of
like-minded individuals,

22:11.130 --> 22:12.927
people who,
for one reason or another,

22:12.960 --> 22:14.848
shared her interest
in thinning the herd.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.822
So, we're reading through
her e-mails and chats.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.124
Once her family attorney
gets here,

22:19.170 --> 22:21.491
we'll interview her, see if she
could point us toward anyone.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.100
No need.
You found something
saying she was involved?

22:24.140 --> 22:25.664
No, not necessarily.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.473
Dale Schmitt's last moments,

22:27.510 --> 22:30.035
he photographed a man
seen only in silhouette.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.604
I committed that silhouette
to memory.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.709
And, um,

22:33.750 --> 22:36.378
I'm-I'm quite sure
that this scientist

22:36.420 --> 22:38.411
is the same man.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.854
His name is, uh, Raymond Thorpe.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.050
And he's the chief virologist

22:44.090 --> 22:46.729
at a lab on the
Upper East Side.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.593
I think he might be our killer.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.160
Chantal?

22:52.200 --> 22:53.736
Hi, I'm Joan.

22:53.770 --> 22:55.397
I work with Marcus.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.862
Uh, I think you met
my partner, Sherlock.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.505
Joan. Of course, right.
I've heard a lot about you.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.905
Likewise. Uh, listen,

23:00.940 --> 23:02.908
I was wondering ifI could
ask you a few questions

23:02.940 --> 23:04.976
about your
ex-husband, Roy.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.443
Why would you--?

23:06.480 --> 23:08.573
Marcus asked me
to look into, uh,

23:08.620 --> 23:10.781
a disagreement that
he and Roy got into.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.640
I asked Marcus
to leave it alone.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.510
And he is.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.516
Look, he's a friend,
I could tell he was upset.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.448
He told me about
the fight at the bar.

23:18.490 --> 23:20.458
So, I offered to look into it,

23:20.500 --> 23:22.127
make sure nothing could
come back on him.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.422
And?

23:23.470 --> 23:24.459
Well, it's my understanding

23:24.500 --> 23:25.899
that when Roy made a scene
here the other day,

23:25.930 --> 23:28.433
he claimed the bar
was his usual hangout.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.506
But when I went to
ask them about it,

23:30.540 --> 23:32.201
they said they'd never
seen him before that night.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.776
I don't understand.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.539
You're saying you think
he was lying?

23:35.580 --> 23:37.901
Well, right now, I'm just trying
to get my facts straight.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.906
So, to the best of
your knowledge,

23:39.950 --> 23:42.009
is Farlane's a bar he frequents?

23:42.050 --> 23:45.144
I mean, honestly,
I'm not the best person to ask.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.454
We may have just signed
our divorce papers,

23:47.490 --> 23:49.754
but it's been three years
since we've lived together.

23:49.790 --> 23:52.679
I mean, hell, Roy was still
on the job when we split.

23:52.730 --> 23:54.493
Which brings me to
my next question.

23:54.530 --> 23:56.589
Why isn't Roy a cop any longer?

23:56.630 --> 23:58.723
You think Raymond's a terrorist?

24:00.500 --> 24:02.229
He was an immunologist with the
Air Force before he came here.

24:02.270 --> 24:05.034
I mean, he-he coaches
my son's soccer team.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.662
Timothy McVeigh
won the Bronze Star

24:06.710 --> 24:07.734
and John Wayne Gacy was a clown,

24:07.780 --> 24:09.930
much like the man
we suspect Dr. Thorpe murdered.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.572
No, Raymond didn't kill anybody.

24:11.610 --> 24:12.577
I'm telling you, you're wrong.

24:12.610 --> 24:13.816
Do you know
where he is?

24:13.850 --> 24:17.217
Well, he said he needed some
time off for a family emergency.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.548
He hasn't been here all week.

24:19.590 --> 24:21.683
It does not mean that
he engineered some superbug.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.585
Does this?

24:25.630 --> 24:26.585
So, he went to the trouble of,

24:26.630 --> 24:28.928
uh, pulling it into the trash,

24:28.960 --> 24:30.257
but he didn't seem
too concerned

24:30.300 --> 24:31.597
about his work being found.

24:31.630 --> 24:32.790
This is what your son's
soccer coach

24:32.830 --> 24:35.560
was doing in his spare time.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.967
And this is what was found
in the contaminated water.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.932
Are those two organisms
the same?

24:42.010 --> 24:43.546
They are.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.775
I don't believe this.

24:45.810 --> 24:47.619
Any idea what the virus does?

24:47.650 --> 24:48.571
Could you open that window?

24:51.250 --> 24:54.788
Given Dr. Thorpe's
absence of several days,

24:54.820 --> 24:57.288
and his apparent lack of concern
about his work being found,

24:57.320 --> 24:58.924
he's probably fled the city.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.099
Yeah, you're probably right,
but we should get an alert

25:01.130 --> 25:03.291
to the TSA and Port Authority,
all the same.

25:03.330 --> 25:05.298
WOMAN: Well, this
doesn't make any sense.

25:05.330 --> 25:07.298
I mean, you're right.

25:07.330 --> 25:10.538
From the looks of it,
Raymond did do what you said.

25:10.570 --> 25:13.698
He used our equipment
to synthesize a virus, making it

25:13.740 --> 25:15.537
chlorine and UV resistant.

25:15.580 --> 25:16.729
Then what doesn't make sense?

25:16.780 --> 25:18.645
Well, what the virus does.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.275
It's basically a harder-to-kill
serotype 40 adenovirus.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.816
It's non-lethal.

25:24.850 --> 25:26.909
It would just
give people

25:26.950 --> 25:28.713
a mild gastrointestinal bug.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.057
So, Raymond Thorpe
went to the trouble

25:32.090 --> 25:33.057
of custom-tailoring a virus

25:33.090 --> 25:35.058
so it would survive
the City's water safeguards.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.056
He introduced that virus
into the water supply

25:37.100 --> 25:39.068
and in all likelihood,
killed a man in the process,

25:39.100 --> 25:42.695
just to give New Yorkers a few
urgent trips to the toilet.

25:43.770 --> 25:45.067
Why?

25:55.920 --> 25:59.287
So, if I'm following
everything you said,

25:59.320 --> 26:02.118
our-_our terrorist doesn't want
to kill the people of New York,

26:02.160 --> 26:05.288
he just wants to give them
a bad case of the runs.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.059
Actually, bad might be
something of an overstatement.

26:07.090 --> 26:09.126
An expert at the lab where
the virus was created said

26:09.160 --> 26:12.129
_ that it _would have run
its course in a matter of days.

26:12.170 --> 26:15.833
Less Montezuma's Revenge,
more Montezuma's Office Prank.

26:15.870 --> 26:18.304
"Prank"? Sounds about right.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.604
I'm starting to think
this Thorpe guy is more likely

26:20.640 --> 26:23.768
to have ties to a frat house
than a terrorist group.

26:23.810 --> 26:25.141
I'm not sure I agree.

26:25.180 --> 26:27.148
You're making
light of this,

26:27.180 --> 26:29.068
because the bug would have
given people diarrhea.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.144
Well, think about it.

26:30.180 --> 26:32.216
Millions of people,
all coming down

26:32.250 --> 26:35.310
with a dehydrating illness,
all at the same time.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.385
Don't drink the water.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.980
But water is exactly
what they would've needed.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.349
There would've been a run
on the stuff,

26:41.400 --> 26:42.753
hospitals would have been
overloaded.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.097
Because of diarrhea?

26:44.130 --> 26:45.688
In developing
countries,

26:45.730 --> 26:48.767
diarrhea kills hundreds
of thousands of children a year.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.631
But this is not
a developing country.

26:50.670 --> 26:53.036
Compared to England,
America's a pimply teenager.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.332
Yes,

26:54.380 --> 26:56.007
Thorpe's plan, had it worked,

26:56.040 --> 26:58.201
would've created some
terror, but given the ease

26:58.250 --> 26:59.706
with which he could have stolen

26:59.750 --> 27:01.342
or synthesized
a far deadlier bug,

27:01.380 --> 27:03.780
it's hard to imagine
that his agenda was political.

27:03.820 --> 27:05.412
(sighs) What about
the woman you brought in?

27:05.450 --> 27:06.986
The Van Bylandt heiress.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.419
Any connection
between her and Thorpe?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.951
She had a scientific journal
that had his picture in it,

27:10.990 --> 27:13.083
but_ she had a lot of
SCIentific journals.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.325
After we talked to her and
poked around her financials,

27:15.360 --> 27:17.191
we think it was just
a coincidence.

27:17.230 --> 27:19.061
HOLMES: So how's it
g0ing on your end?

27:19.100 --> 27:21.330
I'm sure you've made a lot of
progress, being the DHS and all.

27:21.370 --> 27:24.305
You should know,
the press found out

27:24.340 --> 27:26.706
about what happened
in Mount Pleasant.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.139
They now know
we had a near miss

27:28.180 --> 27:30.034
with New York City's
water supply.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.274
How?

27:31.310 --> 27:32.868
Someone leaked the story.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.218
Hopefully not someone
in this room.

27:34.250 --> 27:37.071
In any event, there's
going to be a lot of questions

27:37.120 --> 27:39.816
in the morning, so let me
take this opportunity

27:39.850 --> 27:43.854
to remind you that the answers
need to come from us.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.893
(sighs)

27:57.500 --> 27:58.728
Hello?

27:58.770 --> 27:59.759
Hey.

27:59.810 --> 28:02.028
This clown really dead?

28:02.080 --> 28:04.401
Yeah, he really is.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.769
Who are you?

28:05.810 --> 28:07.402
Me?

28:07.450 --> 28:10.840
I'm the guy who just fixed
your girlfriend's pipes.

28:12.890 --> 28:16.382
Hey, I was just getting ready to
go see Marcus at the precinct.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.127
So it's true.
The shaved bear I met upstairs

28:19.160 --> 28:21.151
installed a water
filtration system?

28:21.200 --> 28:25.227
Okay, first, that shaved bear
got over 600 reviews on RateIt

28:25.270 --> 28:27.022
as the best plumber in the city.

28:27.070 --> 28:29.197
Oh.
Second, until someone
can find Raymond Thorpe

28:29.240 --> 28:32.107
and get him to explain why
he wanted to make everyone sick,

28:32.140 --> 28:34.108
I thought we should take extra
precautions on our water.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.233
This is the model the D.E.P.'s
Web site recommends

28:36.280 --> 28:38.305
for filtering out germs
like the one that Thorpe made.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.170
Well, one of the reasons
I chose to live in New York,

28:40.210 --> 28:41.939
as opposed to other
American cities,

28:41.980 --> 28:44.119
was the quality of its water.

28:44.150 --> 28:46.084
The taste and odor, unmatched.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.953
This glorified strainer
is going to change that.

28:48.990 --> 28:50.218
Now, I suppose

28:50.260 --> 28:51.454
I shouldn't blame you
for falling prey

28:51.490 --> 28:54.129
to the hydro-hysteria
sweeping the city.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.025
The leak that Agent Breslin
mentioned last night is,

28:56.060 --> 28:59.120
in fact, a geyser. Look.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.228
(chuckles)

29:00.270 --> 29:01.498
Yeah. Now remarkably,

29:01.540 --> 29:02.893
one of the only publications

29:02.940 --> 29:04.305
to look past the hysteria

29:04.340 --> 29:06.535
and explore the
consequences

29:06.570 --> 29:08.970
of Thorpe's actions,
was this one.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.773
WATSON:
The Daily Newswire?

29:10.810 --> 29:12.243
You got to be kidding me.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.349
I can see the paper
is mostly bollocks,

29:13.380 --> 29:17.749
but the metro reporter
is tip-top.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.055
Every New Yorker knows--

29:22.090 --> 29:23.455
every New Yorker aside
from you, that is--

29:23.490 --> 29:25.128
that their water

29:25.160 --> 29:27.253
is the champagne
of municipal hydration,

29:27.290 --> 29:29.258
because it arrives
Virtually untouched

29:29.300 --> 29:31.461
from the most pristine
watershed in the country.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.365
What about the chlorine
and the UV?

29:33.400 --> 29:36.096
Those are disinfection measures,
not filtration measures.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.904
The water never passes
through any kind of membrane,

29:38.940 --> 29:41.238
so all _of the natural salts
and minerals are retained.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.406
And this reporter found

29:42.440 --> 29:45.000
that New York's
unfiltered status

29:45.050 --> 29:46.802
is contingent
on an ongoing assessment

29:46.850 --> 29:50.377
known as a Filtration Avoidance
Determination or F.A.D.

29:50.420 --> 29:52.388
And that is awarded
by the EPA.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.149
Well, she thinks the F.A.D.
might be yanked

29:54.190 --> 29:56.317
in the wake of the virus attack

29:56.360 --> 29:58.123
and that the city
will finally be forced

29:58.160 --> 29:59.821
to build a filtration plant.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.555
And my research suggests
that she's right.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.160
In the event that
any of the conditions

30:04.200 --> 30:06.020
of the F.A.D. are broken,

30:06.070 --> 30:08.334
a waterborne disease outbreak
being linked directly

30:08.370 --> 30:11.134
to an unfiltered water system,
for example,

30:11.170 --> 30:12.865
the EPA has the right
to pull the F.A.D.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.969
and demand that the city
break ground on a new plant

30:15.010 --> 30:16.875
within 24 hours.

30:16.910 --> 30:19.208
A plant like that could cost
hundreds of millions.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.205
Try billions.

30:20.250 --> 30:21.274
Well, that's plenty of incentive

30:21.320 --> 30:22.469
for someone to hire Thorpe,

30:22.520 --> 30:25.318
to get him to come up with
a virus that could get past UV

30:25.350 --> 30:27.341
and chlorine and not kill
everyone in the City.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.415
We have to find who's most
likely to build the plant.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.609
Well, I would stay and help...

30:30.660 --> 30:32.321
But you have a meeting
with Marcus.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.867
Bring back some water from
the precinct, would you?

30:37.900 --> 30:39.561
I'm not gonna make any tea
using that.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.889
Okay, thanks.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.959
I was just about to call you
and your partner.

30:47.010 --> 30:48.432
That was the TSA.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.142
A Raymond Thorpe, correct
address and date of birth,

30:51.180 --> 30:54.217
booked a flight from JFK
to Montenegro three days ago.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.138
They're gonna pull video
from the terminal,

30:56.180 --> 30:58.319
confirm he's our guy
and that he really boarded.

30:58.350 --> 31:00.318
And if he did,
Montenegro doesn't have

31:00.350 --> 31:02.011
an extradition treaty
with the U.S.,

31:02.060 --> 31:03.288
so there isn't much
we could do.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.356
Well, the good news is
Sherlock may be able

31:05.390 --> 31:07.255
to identify the person
who hired Thorpe.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.929
But that's not actually
why I'm here.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.359
Um, I found out some
things about Roy Booker

31:11.400 --> 31:13.129
I thought you should know.

31:13.170 --> 31:16.264
So, he didn't just randomly
bump into you the other night.

31:16.300 --> 31:19.906
And he wasn't just
blowing off steam.

31:19.940 --> 31:21.931
He's working as an investigator
for a lawyer named

31:21.980 --> 31:24.301
Ardy Gulbenkian.
You've heard of him?

31:24.350 --> 31:26.910
I've heard plenty about him
from Chantal.

31:26.950 --> 31:29.111
That's Roy, coming
out of his law office.

31:29.150 --> 31:32.244
He's the defense lawyer she's
up against in the Pulaski case.

31:32.290 --> 31:33.917
Well, Chantal's
assistant admitted

31:33.960 --> 31:35.916
that Roy sweet-talked her
into telling him

31:35.960 --> 31:37.951
when and where you
were both meeting.

31:37.990 --> 31:40.026
Then, Gulbenkian flooded
her office with paperwork

31:40.060 --> 31:42.096
so Chantal would be
a no-show.

31:42.130 --> 31:43.324
It was a set-up.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.998
Chantal's probably
the only female ADA

31:45.030 --> 31:47.567
up to speed on the case
and qualified to run it.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.933
And with Myra Pulaski
claiming self-defense,

31:50.970 --> 31:53.404
better for her team
if the prosecutor's male.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.203
That way the jury sees her
being attacked

31:55.240 --> 31:57.128
by a big, scary man.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.341
So Roy makes a scene
in Chantal's office,

31:59.380 --> 32:00.608
the DA thinks she's distracted,

32:00.650 --> 32:02.117
pulls her off the case.

32:02.150 --> 32:03.572
And I played
right into the plan.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.383
You did, but

32:05.420 --> 32:08.617
I have an idea how you
could set things right.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.992
What the hell?

32:25.640 --> 32:28.279
Can I help you?

32:28.310 --> 32:30.437
Yeah, you could tell me
how much it costs

32:30.480 --> 32:33.369
to turn a respected virologist
into a mass-poisoner.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.446
Excuse me?
_You own _
Vecoli Construction,

32:35.480 --> 32:37.118
one of the largest
contracting companies

32:37.150 --> 32:39.084
in New York.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.712
Time and again
you've won the bid

32:40.750 --> 32:43.218
to build an $8 billion
water-filtration plant

32:43.260 --> 32:44.386
in New York City.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.284
But only in the event
one is needed.

32:46.330 --> 32:48.321
Thanks to its F.A.D.,

32:48.360 --> 32:49.725
the city's never needed one.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.365
That is until you paid
Raymond Thorpe

32:52.400 --> 32:54.766
to engineer a virus
which could defeat

32:54.800 --> 32:57.064
both U-V and chlorine measures.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.738
You're obviously
a crazy person.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.603
Do yourself a favor-- leave,
before I call the cops.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.107
You're denying knowing
Raymond Thorpe?

33:03.140 --> 33:04.539
I never heard that name
before in my life.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.070
Please.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.600
I'll admit a search of your home

33:07.650 --> 33:10.016
yielded no evidence
of a link between

33:10.050 --> 33:12.314
you and Thorpe, or you might
just be good at hiding it.

33:12.350 --> 33:13.317
You were in my house?

33:13.350 --> 33:14.715
Yeah, that's where I got this.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.749
(clicks)

33:18.530 --> 33:20.157
So you've stockpiled

33:20.190 --> 33:21.623
thousands of gallons of water.

33:21.660 --> 33:24.458
I mean, it-it-it's
almost as if you knew

33:24.500 --> 33:26.024
there'd be a problem
with the city's

33:26.070 --> 33:27.389
water supply this week.

33:27.430 --> 33:28.692
I had that delivered
this morning

33:28.740 --> 33:30.628
when I heard what happened
in Mount Pleasant, okay?

33:30.670 --> 33:33.332
You know what, that's it.
I'm calling 911.

33:33.370 --> 33:35.270
Go ahead. I've got a very good
relationship with the police,

33:35.310 --> 33:36.732
so I'd be happy
for them to join us.

33:36.780 --> 33:39.408
Okay, fine, you're right.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.645
My company's in line to build
a water-filtration plant

33:41.680 --> 33:43.170
for the city--

33:43.220 --> 33:45.040
Emphasis on filtration.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.011
Why "emphasis?"

33:46.050 --> 33:48.052
Because we got a hell
of a lot more money

33:48.090 --> 33:50.581
tied up in UV
disinfection these days.

33:50.620 --> 33:54.124
You know why? Because filtration
plants are complicated.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.219
They pump water through stages
with names like

33:56.260 --> 33:58.296
"coagulation,"
"flocculation,"

33:58.330 --> 34:00.719
uh, "dissolved air floatation."

34:00.770 --> 34:03.398
When you're dealing with
the New York City watershed,

34:03.440 --> 34:05.237
that's overkill.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.158
UV disinfection plants
are cheaper,

34:07.210 --> 34:08.472
they're easy to build.

34:08.510 --> 34:12.446
So you tell me--
why would I pay somebody

34:12.480 --> 34:15.540
to design a bug to beat UV

34:15.580 --> 34:17.343
if that's where
I make my profits?

34:17.380 --> 34:18.847
You can prove that you're
more heavily invested

34:18.890 --> 34:20.448
in ultraviolet?

34:20.490 --> 34:21.855
Look on the Web site.

34:21.890 --> 34:23.619
It's all there.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.599
Why'd you buy
so much water, then?

34:30.630 --> 34:32.359
Because I could.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.459
That, and it's gonna
take years

34:34.500 --> 34:36.695
for that plant
to get up and running.

34:36.740 --> 34:38.401
I told you,
they're complicated.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.169
This one's gonna take
three or four years at least.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.302
Meantime,

34:44.280 --> 34:47.602
No, you wouldn't.

34:47.650 --> 34:48.844
Who would?

34:55.920 --> 34:59.378
Hey. How'd it go
with the, uh...?

34:59.430 --> 35:02.456
Hmm, it's nice
to see you, too.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.090
(banging, clanging downstairs)

35:07.330 --> 35:08.592
Sherlock!

35:08.640 --> 35:10.790
(grunting)

35:15.280 --> 35:16.474
What are you doing?

35:16.510 --> 35:17.772
It's not personal,
Watson, it's business.

35:17.810 --> 35:19.698
I need a patent number.

35:19.750 --> 35:23.868
Oh. You're getting
water everywhere.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.444
I was so busy trying
to think of a cure

35:25.490 --> 35:26.889
to the city's water problem

35:26.920 --> 35:28.911
I didn't stop to
consider the Band-Aid.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.520
What are you talking about?
A water-filtration plant

35:31.560 --> 35:35.291
is a cure to a problem
presented by a virus

35:35.330 --> 35:38.424
which is immune to chlorine
and UV treatment.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.530
This filter is the Band-Aid.

35:41.570 --> 35:42.935
Even if the EPA
compels the city

35:42.970 --> 35:44.437
to break ground on
a new plant tomorrow,

35:44.470 --> 35:46.609
it won't be operational
for years.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.801
So in the interim, what are
thirsty New Yorkers to do?

35:48.840 --> 35:50.899
They can't all drink,
wash, cook, and clean

35:50.940 --> 35:52.601
with bottled water, can we?

35:52.650 --> 35:55.642
No, we need filters
on every tap in the city.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.612
It's like what happened in Flint

35:56.650 --> 35:57.810
when they found
all that lead in the water.

35:57.850 --> 35:59.442
The government had to buy

35:59.490 --> 36:00.843
home water filters
for everyone who lived there.

36:00.890 --> 36:02.653
Filtering lead is
relatively easy.

36:02.690 --> 36:04.282
Removing viruses,

36:04.330 --> 36:05.479
that requires
a special product.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.350
I confirmed what
you said earlier.

36:07.390 --> 36:10.393
There is, indeed,
only one home filter

36:10.430 --> 36:12.523
the D.E.P. recommends
for preventing

36:12.570 --> 36:14.435
the kind of waterborne
disease outbreak

36:14.470 --> 36:16.597
that Raymond Thorpe
tried to carry out.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.891
That one.

36:17.940 --> 36:21.307
So Flint has, what,
100,000 people?

36:21.340 --> 36:23.774
New York has
eight million.

36:23.810 --> 36:26.608
So whoever holds
the patent for this

36:26.650 --> 36:28.572
would make a fortune.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.542
Mm. Not "whoever."

36:30.580 --> 36:31.649
A recent acquaintance
of ours.

36:39.030 --> 36:39.883
Captain.

36:39.930 --> 36:41.591
Agent Breslin, thanks
for coming back in.

36:41.630 --> 36:42.756
I promised you
I'd let you know

36:42.800 --> 36:44.222
if we had anything more,

36:44.270 --> 36:45.794
and I'm a man of my word.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.264
Well, FYI, my boss is reaching
out to the State Department.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.894
We're asking them to contact
the government in Montenegro,

36:50.940 --> 36:52.464
seeing if we can
persuade them

36:52.510 --> 36:54.478
to send back
Raymond Thorpe.

36:54.510 --> 36:55.772
Now, I wouldn't
hold my breath,

36:55.810 --> 36:57.471
but it's worth a shot.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.705
Trust me, no one's
giving up here, either.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.445
In fact, I think
you're gonna be surprised

37:01.480 --> 37:04.017
by what you hear.

37:04.050 --> 37:05.813
(indistinct chatter)

37:05.850 --> 37:09.889
Mr. Holmes,
Miss Watson, Wendell.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.683
We're just bringing
Mr. Hecht up to speed

37:11.730 --> 37:12.856
on the investigation.

37:12.890 --> 37:15.495
Raymond Thorpe's virus
was custom-made

37:15.530 --> 37:17.998
to force the city to enact
water-filtration measures.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.895
So we've been looking
into who profits

37:19.930 --> 37:21.795
from those measures
being taken.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.728
And I got a call that
one of you visited,

37:23.770 --> 37:25.931
uh, Gio Vecoli?

37:25.970 --> 37:29.303
The head of the company
that's building the new plant.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.479
He was a bit ruffled,
but it sounded like you

37:31.510 --> 37:32.807
decided he wasn't a murderer.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.511
We did.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.745
Largely because we discovered
a different profit motive.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.509
WATSON:
The home-filtration system

37:38.550 --> 37:41.553
your department is now buying
for everyone in the city.

37:41.590 --> 37:44.013
Strange you didn't disclose
you own the patent.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.925
Yo_ur Ph.D. is in_
materials engineering.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.554
Before entering
the public sector,

37:48.600 --> 37:50.056
you tried your hand
at entrepreneurship.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.660
The water-filtration system
that you developed, however,

37:52.700 --> 37:54.429
failed to find a niche.
It was,

37:54.470 --> 37:56.529
it was too pricey for
the average consumer,

37:56.570 --> 37:58.868
and it was not quite
the high-end system

37:58.910 --> 38:01.879
which attracts
larger institutions.

38:01.910 --> 38:03.502
When the government's
footing the bill, however,

38:03.540 --> 38:04.973
the economics are
a little different.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.978
So, as the man in charge
of the response

38:07.010 --> 38:08.341
to the Thorpe attack,

38:08.380 --> 38:10.473
you could make sure
the city chose

38:10.520 --> 38:11.839
to buy your filters,

38:11.890 --> 38:13.915
making you very rich.

38:13.950 --> 38:15.656
Is this about me
failing to reveal

38:15.690 --> 38:17.351
a conflict of interests,

38:17.390 --> 38:20.325
or are you accusing me
of orchestrating the attack?

38:20.360 --> 38:22.555
You tell us.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.093
If it's the first one...

38:28.130 --> 38:31.668
guilty as charged.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.929
And I'll pay whatever
penalty I'm due.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.107
But the other one,
that's, that's a fairy tale.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.973
Are you saying that
I hired Raymond Thorpe?

38:40.010 --> 38:42.717
Is that it?
I don't even know him.

38:42.750 --> 38:43.944
Actually, you do.

38:43.980 --> 38:45.641
The lab Thorpe worked at

38:45.690 --> 38:48.716
had to comply with D.E.P.
environmental codes.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.081
And you were the person
in charge of overseeing that.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.350
So Thorpe's calendars
show that he attended

38:53.390 --> 38:55.358
half a dozen meetings
over the years

38:55.400 --> 38:56.958
that you also attended.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.628
Okay, so I don't
remember knowing him.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.991
Where's this all going?
The guy fled the country,

39:02.040 --> 39:04.361
and there is no connection
between him and me

39:04.410 --> 39:08.062
besides a few meetings that
a lot of other people attended.

39:08.110 --> 39:09.702
What, are you looking
for a scapegoat

39:09.740 --> 39:11.037
because he got away?

39:11.080 --> 39:14.004
TSA sent us this.

39:16.450 --> 39:20.045
That's Thorpe, about to board
his flight to Montenegro.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.388
Over the course of an hour,

39:22.420 --> 39:25.583
he got up to go
to the restroom four times.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.622
I guess he got some
of that sludge

39:30.660 --> 39:33.788
he was pouring
into the aqueduct on him.

39:33.830 --> 39:36.037
HOLMES:
We contacted the Montenegrin
government ourselves.

39:36.070 --> 39:39.005
There's no extradition
treaty with the United States.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.907
But they were only too happy to
put Dr. Thorpe back on a plane

39:41.940 --> 39:45.569
when they discovered he was
carrying a virulent superbug.

39:45.610 --> 39:46.941
We might have left out
the part about

39:46.980 --> 39:48.743
it not being lethal
or contagious.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.748
WATSON:
Given the nature of the virus

39:50.780 --> 39:54.079
you chose, we assume you
never meant for anyone to die.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.418
But Thorpe murdered Schmitt

39:56.460 --> 39:58.451
while committing your crime.

39:58.490 --> 40:00.151
His flight should be landing
in a couple of hours.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.953
We'll have people there
to pick him up,

40:02.000 --> 40:05.822
which leaves you plenty of time
to cut the first deal.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.161
Roy Booker!

40:13.870 --> 40:15.974
Detective Marcus Bell.

40:16.010 --> 40:17.204
You want to take
another shot at me?

40:17.240 --> 40:18.605
No bouncers around this time.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.777
I'm not here
to fight you, man.

40:20.810 --> 40:22.812
I'm here to tell you
how it's gonna be.

40:22.850 --> 40:24.215
Is that right?

40:24.250 --> 40:26.138
You were on the job
for just ten years,

40:26.190 --> 40:27.509
and then you took
early retirement

40:27.550 --> 40:28.949
on a disability claim, right?

40:28.990 --> 40:30.059
Said you tore
your right rotator cuff?

40:30.090 --> 40:31.159
Took a three-quarter pension?

40:31.190 --> 40:32.953
So?

40:32.990 --> 40:34.127
So the claim is bogus.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.151
Your shoulder's fine.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.519
I'm sure

40:37.560 --> 40:39.721
you remember
that bouncer right there.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.136
The one who's twice your size?

40:42.170 --> 40:43.865
You pulled away from him
like it was nothing

40:43.900 --> 40:45.128
with your right arm.

40:45.170 --> 40:46.865
If you had torn
that rotator cuff,

40:46.910 --> 40:48.036
even two years ago,

40:48.070 --> 40:49.207
that would have hurt like crazy.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.504
Who says it didn't?

40:53.280 --> 40:55.669
What is it you think that you're
threatening me with right now?

40:55.720 --> 40:56.914
Because that right there...

40:56.950 --> 40:59.487
(scoffs)
doesn't prove anything.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.044
Nah, but it doesn't have to.

41:01.090 --> 41:02.159
Just has to be enough
to convince the department

41:02.190 --> 41:03.851
to launch an investigation.

41:03.890 --> 41:05.824
I'm pretty sure
it would do that.

41:05.860 --> 41:08.055
If it were to get
sent to the department.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.092
And if that investigation
comes up bad for you,

41:10.130 --> 41:11.563
you know what happens, right?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.227
First, you have
to give back

41:13.270 --> 41:15.966
any pension money
you've collected so far.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.991
Then, if you ever want
to collect a pension again,

41:18.040 --> 41:20.804
you have to go back to work
and finish your 20.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.604
What do you want?

41:23.640 --> 41:25.141
I know what you were
really doing

41:25.180 --> 41:27.501
when you got in my face
the other night.

41:27.550 --> 41:30.075
So, one-- you're gonna quit
working for that defense

41:30.120 --> 41:31.246
attorney today.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.282
No more giving anyone
leverage on Chantal.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.254
Once that's done,
her boss should be okay

41:35.290 --> 41:36.848
keeping her on the case.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.720
We clear?

41:52.310 --> 41:54.699
