That's the wrong way
of putting it.

The things you need,
that anyone needs --

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.456
what happens is you become
someone who relies on the love

01:25:59.523 --> 01:26:01.457
of three or four million
total strangers

01:26:01.525 --> 01:26:02.993

-- Really?

01:26:13.004 --> 01:26:15.473
Yeah, the guy I came with
looks like he's ready to go.

01:26:15.539 --> 01:26:17.200
I'm Dan Rydell, by the way.

01:26:17.275 --> 01:26:18.367
I know who you are.

-- Right here, right now.
-- What about it?

01:26:56.814 --> 01:26:59.340
Wouldn't this be considered
a date?

01:26:59.417 --> 01:27:00.782
-- No.
-- Why?

01:27:00.851 --> 01:27:02.512
Because you and I
aren't allowed to date

01:27:02.586 --> 01:27:04.520
until you've dated
other people for six months.

01:27:04.588 --> 01:27:06.750

-- this guy --
-- The loner.

If this shivering loner
were to look in this direction,

01:27:20.004 --> 01:27:22.166
he would assume
the two of us are on a date.

01:27:22.239 --> 01:27:23.297
He'd be wrong.

01:27:23.374 --> 01:27:24.637

-- Yes.
-- What have you done?

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:13.381
I've done nothing less than face down the
millennium and show it who's in charge.

or something?

01:28:15.192 --> 01:28:16.751

-- A K-Y test.

that it is January 1, 2000,

and you'll see
that we're YZK-compatible

as the servant of no master,

01:28:34.278 --> 01:28:36.747

that "nerd" thing.

01:32:58.108 --> 01:32:59.234
What time?

01:32:59.309 --> 01:33:01.300
7:50.

01:33:01.378 --> 01:33:03.039
[Laughs] 7:50?

01:33:04.248 --> 01:33:06.182
When she's done
with her last appointment.

01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:09.242
Sounds to me like she might have
one more on her schedule.

01:33:09.319 --> 01:33:11.481
Hey, don't you work
at 7:50?

01:33:11.555 --> 01:33:12.750
No.

01:33:12.823 --> 01:33:14.814
-- I work at 7:50.
-- That's why I don't have to.

01:33:14.892 --> 01:33:17.054
-- Danny --
-- I'll be gone for an hour.

01:33:17.127 --> 01:33:18.322
Oh, I understand.

01:33:18.395 --> 01:33:20.489
You do not understand.

01:33:21.498 --> 01:33:22.260
Stand by animation.

01:33:22.332 --> 01:33:24.767
Stand by sound 22, 23,
and 23A.

01:33:24.835 --> 01:33:25.996
Loading effects 12.

01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:27.936
You guys mind
if I do the honors?

01:33:28.005 --> 01:33:29.666
-- He wants to push the button.
-- Yeah.

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:30.536
Sure.

01:33:30.607 --> 01:33:34.009
At the press of this button, the Y2K
problem will officially cry uncle.

01:33:34.078 --> 01:33:35.944
<i>And I'll say, "Yeah?
Who's your daddy?</i>

01:33:36.013 --> 01:33:38.004
"I am!
That's right, say it.

01:33:38.082 --> 01:33:39.846
Jeremy's your daddy."
Then --

01:33:39.917 --> 01:33:41.180
-- Jeremy.
-- Here we go.

01:33:41.251 --> 01:33:42.878
In 3...2...

01:33:42.953 --> 01:33:45.718
[ Static, high-pitched tone ]

01:33:45.789 --> 01:33:46.881
Huh.

01:33:48.692 --> 01:33:49.750
Yes.

01:33:50.794 --> 01:33:52.387
Huh.

01:33:52.463 --> 01:33:54.591
Yes. Will?

01:33:54.665 --> 01:33:55.928
I've got nothing.

01:33:55.999 --> 01:33:58.559
-- <i>Chris?</i> -- <i>I've got no sound
in the studio or on the router.</i>

01:33:58.635 --> 01:33:59.864
Kim?

01:33:59.937 --> 01:34:01.268
My control panel just crashed.

01:34:01.338 --> 01:34:03.272
Okay. Well, I'm just gonna run
to the ATM,

01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:05.274
pick up some bottled water
and canned goods,

01:34:05.342 --> 01:34:06.332
and I'll be right back.

01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:07.673
Hey, hey.
This is nothing.

01:34:07.745 --> 01:34:09.907
I need to reaccess the mainframe
and reboot the system.

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.539
-- How long will that take?
-- No time.

01:34:11.615 --> 01:34:14.778
You understand that, you know, in real
life we're doing a show at 11 :00.

01:34:14.852 --> 01:34:17.981
That's in 4 1/2 hours. I'll be
done fixing this in 5 minutes.

01:34:18.055 --> 01:34:20.046
Five minutes, everybody.

01:34:20.124 --> 01:34:22.286
[High-pitched tone continues]

01:34:24.928 --> 01:34:26.862
[Telephone ringing]

01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:29.490
Come on.
I'm your daddy.

01:34:43.881 --> 01:34:45.542
-- I do not need therapy.
-- Okay.

01:34:45.616 --> 01:34:47.914
-- You think that's what she thinks?
-- No.

01:34:47.985 --> 01:34:50.317
-- If that's what she thinks,
she's wrong. -- Okay.

01:34:51.288 --> 01:34:53.689
Don't you think she's wrong
if she thinks that?

01:34:53.757 --> 01:34:55.589
Listen, McMurphy,
if it were up to me,

01:34:55.659 --> 01:34:57.457
I'd let you and the big Indian
out of the hospital, but --

01:34:57.528 --> 01:34:59.292
Hey, let's just hold onto
our horses here.

01:34:59.363 --> 01:35:01.661
Now, I may not be a
framed picture of mental health,

01:35:01.732 --> 01:35:03.666
but doctor-girl's
got another think coming

01:35:03.734 --> 01:35:06.999
if she thinks I'm gonna go lie on her
couch and, you know, talk to her.

01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:09.562
-- Okay.
-- She hangs out in bars, Casey.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:12.610
Like I'm supposed to take advice
from some gin-soaked floozy?

01:35:12.676 --> 01:35:14.542
-- Yeah. -- <i>I'm going
to straighten this out.</i>

01:35:14.611 --> 01:35:16.010
-- When?
-- 7:50.

01:35:16.079 --> 01:35:16.875
-- At her office?
-- Yes, indeed.

01:35:16.947 --> 01:35:18.039
Casey.

01:35:18.115 --> 01:35:20.140
-- Natalie...I'm not crazy.
-- Yeah.

01:35:20.217 --> 01:35:20.809
Yeah, right.

01:35:20.884 --> 01:35:23.251
You need to cut 20 seconds
from the Pac-10.

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.617
No problem.

01:35:24.688 --> 01:35:26.178
Also, you should know
that Sam Donovan called

01:35:26.256 --> 01:35:28.816
-- from Detroit last night and
said it was a good show. -- Great.

01:35:28.892 --> 01:35:30.257
-- Wait.
-- What?

01:35:30.327 --> 01:35:32.455
He's telling Casey
it was a good show?

01:35:32.529 --> 01:35:34.019
He's telling all of us
it was a good show.

01:35:34.097 --> 01:35:36.225
-- <i>But you were telling Casey.</i>
-- <i>I was telling both of you.</i>

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.496
-- <i>You were looking at Casey.</i>
-- <i>I was looking at both of you.</i>

01:35:38.569 --> 01:35:40.059
You were looking at Casey
longer.

01:35:40.137 --> 01:35:42.970
-- This isn't gonna make you
any crazier, is it? -- No.

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.065
Jeremy's got it just about
fixed, so it'll just be --

01:35:46.543 --> 01:35:49.240
<i>[Sighs]</i>

01:35:50.647 --> 01:35:53.514
I'm not crazy, right?
The lights did just go out?

01:35:53.584 --> 01:35:55.382
Yeah.

01:36:00.657 --> 01:36:01.681
Jeremy?

01:36:01.758 --> 01:36:03.522
-- <i>Jeremy?</i>
-- It's going to be okay.

01:36:03.594 --> 01:36:05.756
-- Is all the power out?
-- What <i>do</i> you mean?

01:36:05.829 --> 01:36:08.298
-- Is all the power out?
-- No, of course not.

01:36:08.365 --> 01:36:10.356
-- <i>What did we lose?</i>
-- <i>We lost the control room...</i>

01:36:10.434 --> 01:36:11.560
-- <i>Yes.</i>
-- <i>...and the studio.</i>

01:36:11.635 --> 01:36:13.694
-- <i>Okay.</i>
-- <i>The newsroom and the offices,</i>

01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:16.501
Editing, Graphics,
Engineering, Sound.

01:36:16.573 --> 01:36:19.042
Is anything working?

01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:20.167
No.

01:36:20.244 --> 01:36:22.303
I thought you said
we didn't lose all power.

01:36:22.379 --> 01:36:24.609
-- I thought you meant in
the whole city. -- No.

01:36:24.681 --> 01:36:27.810
-- 'Cause the rest of the city is fine.
-- Yes, you have to end this test now.

01:36:27.885 --> 01:36:30.115
-- Right. -- You can try
again another time,

01:36:30.187 --> 01:36:32.622
but you have to tell the computer
that it's not January 1st.

01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:34.589
-- Yeah. Here's the
thing -- -- No.

01:36:34.658 --> 01:36:36.456
-- The thing is...
-- Please don't say it.

01:36:36.526 --> 01:36:37.755
...I can't get
the computers back.

01:36:37.828 --> 01:36:39.887
You can't get
the computers back.

01:36:39.963 --> 01:36:41.328
-- No.
-- Why?

01:36:41.398 --> 01:36:44.095
-- Do you see anything that runs on
electricity working right now? -- No.

01:36:44.167 --> 01:36:47.296
-- VVell... -- You really think this is
the best time to get snippy with me?

01:36:47.371 --> 01:36:48.839
-- I'm trying.
-- Try harder.

01:36:48.906 --> 01:36:50.840
-- I have to see someone in
Physical Resources. -- Fine.

-- Hi.

01:37:01.652 --> 01:37:03.051
You scared me.

Isn't this cool?

01:37:04.755 --> 01:37:06.689
Hmm. Let me think.

01:37:06.757 --> 01:37:07.690
No!

01:37:07.758 --> 01:37:09.055
Okay.

-- They have power upstairs?
-- Yes.

-- They have systems?
-- Yes.

-- Prep studio

-- Natalie -- -- It's small, it's
water-damaged, it's slightly mildewed.

01:37:18.268 --> 01:37:20.635
I agree that ours is
a much nicer studio.

01:37:20.704 --> 01:37:24.937
I guess the only problem
is that we can't see it!

01:37:25.008 --> 01:37:27.409
-- I'll get things going upstairs.
-- Thank you.

01:37:28.979 --> 01:37:30.413

upstairs tonight!

I mean, I don't want to question
your professional opinion,

01:38:33.710 --> 01:38:35.872
but she looked a little...crazy.

01:38:45.856 --> 01:38:46.721
Sure.

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:49.054
There was, among a few
of the people I work with,

01:38:49.126 --> 01:38:51.356
some confusion over whether you
wanted me to call you for a date

01:38:51.428 --> 01:38:53.522
or whether you wanted me
to call you for an appointment.

01:38:53.597 --> 01:38:56.157
-- Really? That is funny.
-- Yeah.

01:38:56.233 --> 01:38:56.927
Yes, it is.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.525
Have you ever been in therapy?

-- Me?

-- I still am.
-- Really?

01:39:06.309 --> 01:39:08.073
-- Yeah.
-- That's allowed?

01:39:08.145 --> 01:39:09.943
-- It's encouraged.
-- You're kidding.

'Cause I'm ju--
Well, I'm not.

01:39:13.283 --> 01:39:15.581
L-| just assumed that someone
who needed a therapist

01:39:15.652 --> 01:39:18.314
would want someone with, you
know, a full supply of marbles.

01:39:18.388 --> 01:39:20.152
-- Danny.
-- Yeah?

01:39:20.223 --> 01:39:22.885
I have roughly the same number
of marbles as everyone else.

01:39:22.959 --> 01:39:24.154
-- I'm sure.
-- So do you.

01:39:24.227 --> 01:39:26.559
I have, actually,
an excess of marbles.

01:39:26.630 --> 01:39:29.463
I can tell, and you seem
like a nice guy.

01:39:29.533 --> 01:39:30.864
-- I am.
-- I know.

01:39:30.934 --> 01:39:33.198
-- You're a nice guy, and you're
a smart guy. -- Thank you.

01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:34.931
So why doesn't
your father like you?

01:39:35.005 --> 01:39:36.734
What?

01:39:36.807 --> 01:39:39.003
I believe in cutting through the first
six months and getting to the stuff.

01:39:39.076 --> 01:39:41.374
Excuse me. Are we on a date right
now, or we having a session?

01:39:41.445 --> 01:39:42.708
Which did you want it to be?

01:39:42.779 --> 01:39:44.076
A date.

Okay.

Why did you ask me
about my father?

Did you go to school
to get good at what you do?

01:39:51.321 --> 01:39:52.914
-- Yeah.
-- Me too.

01:39:52.989 --> 01:39:54.753
-- How 'bout a quick dinner? --
Hang on a second there, Sigmund.

01:39:54.825 --> 01:39:56.418
Why do you think
my father doesn't like me?

Why do you think
your father doesn't like you?

01:39:57.994 --> 01:40:01.294
No, I meant, what do you
observe about me --

01:40:01.364 --> 01:40:03.059
Don't worry about it.

01:40:04.334 --> 01:40:06.098
My father likes me, Abby.

01:40:06.169 --> 01:40:08.968
She likes me just fine.

01:40:09.406 --> 01:40:10.396
She?

01:40:10.474 --> 01:40:12.943
-- What? -- <i>You said,
"She likes</i> me <i>just fine."</i>

01:40:13.009 --> 01:40:15.341
-- No, I didn't.
-- Okay.

01:40:15.412 --> 01:40:17.039
-- I <i>didn't.</i>
-- <i>Let's get</i> a <i>hamburger.</i>

01:40:17.114 --> 01:40:18.013
-- Abby...
-- Yeah.

01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:19.913
-- Why <i>did</i> I <i>say that?</i>
-- <i>I don't know.</i>

01:40:22.486 --> 01:40:24.113
Dan, it's been
kind of a long day.

01:40:24.187 --> 01:40:25.484
Mind if we sit down?

01:40:28.358 --> 01:40:30.087
No.

01:40:43.807 --> 01:40:46.640
[indistinct voices]

01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:51.006
Aw, look at this --
Bob Cratchit.

01:40:51.081 --> 01:40:53.243
-- This isn't funny.
-- You see me laughing?

01:40:53.316 --> 01:40:54.909
-- Hey, listen --
-- Don't <i>move.</i>

01:40:54.985 --> 01:40:56.077
Why?

01:40:56.153 --> 01:40:57.814
You look nice
in the candlelight.

01:41:01.258 --> 01:41:04.228
-- Over here like this?
-- You <i>were</i> fine.

01:41:04.294 --> 01:41:05.591
No, I want to go back
to the way it was.

01:41:05.662 --> 01:41:06.891
-- Don't worry about it.
-- Over here?

01:41:06.963 --> 01:41:09.557
You know, you can squeeze
the life out of a moment

01:41:09.633 --> 01:41:11.067
like nobody I've ever met.

01:41:11.134 --> 01:41:13.364
Well, excuse me for wanting
to get it right.

01:41:13.436 --> 01:41:15.495
-- I have no trouble exousing you for that.
-- Thank you.

01:41:15.572 --> 01:41:17.040
We're gonna move upstairs
to studio

01:41:17.107 --> 01:41:18.871
[Groans] I'm not wild
about studio

01:41:18.942 --> 01:41:19.932
Why not?

01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:21.444
Because this studio
is my home.

01:41:21.511 --> 01:41:23.343
For tonight we'll make
the other studio your home.

01:41:23.413 --> 01:41:25.347
-- <i>It doesn't really work
like that,</i> -- I <i>bet it does.</i>

01:41:25.415 --> 01:41:27.975
-- Dana -- -- Studio
Let's start heading up.

01:41:28.051 --> 01:41:30.076
-- <i>Hey.</i>
-- <i>Hey, where have you been?</i>

01:41:30.153 --> 01:41:31.587
I was cutting some new film.

01:41:31.655 --> 01:41:32.713
-- For Oregon State?
-- Yeah.

01:41:32.789 --> 01:41:33.881
No, for Memphis.

01:41:33.957 --> 01:41:35.891
Guys, studio 10 minutes.

01:41:35.992 --> 01:41:37.824
[Sighs]

01:41:37.861 --> 01:41:39.295
How'd it go?

01:41:39.362 --> 01:41:40.830
-- Good. Yeah.
-- Yeah?

01:41:40.897 --> 01:41:43.025
Yeah. Let me, uh, swap Memphis
for N.C. State, okay?

01:41:43.099 --> 01:41:45.158
-- <i>Fine.</i>
-- <i>I'm gonna go pull some tape.</i>

01:41:45.235 --> 01:41:46.031
Danny --

01:41:46.102 --> 01:41:48.571
<i>Casey, I really just want to --
You know, it was no big deal.</i>

01:41:48.638 --> 01:41:49.662
-- <i>It was good.</i>
-- Good.

01:41:49.739 --> 01:41:51.400
-- I'm gonna go pull some tape.
-- Okay.

01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:57.042
Um, the circuits here
are all GFCI.

01:41:57.113 --> 01:41:59.104
My point being
that there's probably no need

01:41:59.182 --> 01:42:01.480
to check for a ground fault
in the Ethernet bridge,

01:42:01.551 --> 01:42:04.953
but, you know, yes,
go ahead and do it anyway.

01:42:05.021 --> 01:42:07.922
I suppose I'm not really
in a position to give advice,

01:42:07.991 --> 01:42:10.323
except to say,
is it possible that a spike

01:42:10.393 --> 01:42:12.862
in the slave sync signal
shorted out the bus?

01:42:12.929 --> 01:42:14.419
-- Honey... -- Natalie,
I think it's possible

01:42:14.497 --> 01:42:17.159
that a spike in the slave sync
signal shorted the PCI bus

01:42:17.234 --> 01:42:19.498
so the DMA controller
had an IRQ conflict.

01:42:19.569 --> 01:42:22.800
-- Honey -- -- Dave, isn't it possible
that a spike in the slave sync signal

01:42:22.872 --> 01:42:24.431
-- shorted the PCI bus?
-- No.

01:42:24.507 --> 01:42:26.532
Damn it!

01:42:26.610 --> 01:42:28.339
Damn it! Damn it!

01:42:28.411 --> 01:42:30.345
-- Jeremy --
-- Damn it.

01:42:32.215 --> 01:42:33.808
Could you give us the room
for a second?

01:42:33.883 --> 01:42:36.113
-- Sure.
-- Yeah, sure.

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:45.491
It's not a big deal.

01:42:45.562 --> 01:42:47.052
It's not a big deal?

01:42:47.130 --> 01:42:48.120
It's not.

01:42:48.198 --> 01:42:49.256
Look around you.

01:42:49.332 --> 01:42:52.529
[Sighs]
You weren't here the first year.

01:42:52.602 --> 01:42:55.230
On a list of the top 10 things
we screwed up,

01:42:55.305 --> 01:42:56.773
knocking the power out
with a Y2K test

01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:58.330
wouldn't have made the cut.

01:42:58.408 --> 01:42:59.637
-- This is different.
-- Why?

01:42:59.709 --> 01:43:00.870
'Cause this is a metaphor.

01:43:00.944 --> 01:43:02.434
-- For what?
-- For this! For this!

01:43:02.512 --> 01:43:04.844
For this new millennium, which everyone
seems to be looking forward to,

01:43:04.914 --> 01:43:06.973
and I'd like to be
looking forward to it.

01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:09.109
Why am I having trouble
getting on board?

01:43:09.185 --> 01:43:11.677
What bad thing do you think is
gonna happen on January 1st?

01:43:11.755 --> 01:43:13.814
Well, for one thing, all
the power's going to go out.

01:43:13.890 --> 01:43:15.551
Yeah, but not in the whole city.

01:43:15.625 --> 01:43:17.024
The day isn't over yet.

01:43:17.093 --> 01:43:18.822
Guys, it's time
to head upstairs.

01:43:18.895 --> 01:43:20.920
Dana, tell Jeremy
not to fear the new millennium.

01:43:20.997 --> 01:43:22.931
-- Don't fear the new millennium.
-- Do it better than that.

01:43:22.999 --> 01:43:25.127
-- There's nothing to fear from
the new millennium. -- You see?

01:43:25.235 --> 01:43:28.034
<i>Though I suspect you'll be spending a
good part of it looking for a job.</i>

01:43:28.104 --> 01:43:29.299
Are we going upstairs?

01:43:29.372 --> 01:43:31.966
<i>Dana: Yes. Natalie: Pep Jeremy up.
-- Why'?</i>

01:43:32.042 --> 01:43:33.407
He fears the new millennium.

01:43:33.476 --> 01:43:34.409
Me too.

01:43:34.477 --> 01:43:36.002
Good job.

01:43:36.112 --> 01:43:37.671
This century was my home.

01:43:37.714 --> 01:43:38.806
Exactly.

01:43:38.882 --> 01:43:41.214
Men like Jeremy and me,
we're 20th-century men.

01:43:41.284 --> 01:43:44.584
<i>-- Okay, can we go'? -- You reaiiy think things are
gonna be that different in the next millennium?</i>

01:43:45.822 --> 01:43:49.781
I think Dana and I still won't have gone on a
first date yet, if that's what you're asking.

01:43:49.859 --> 01:43:50.849
It was.

01:43:50.927 --> 01:43:51.917
Let's go.

01:43:51.995 --> 01:43:54.225
The next millennium
will be spectacular.

01:43:54.297 --> 01:43:55.856
<i>If Will be.</i>

01:43:55.932 --> 01:43:57.923
<i>I'm managing editor
of "Sports Night,"</i>

01:43:58.001 --> 01:44:01.631
and 100 years ago,
I wasn't allowed to vote.

01:44:01.705 --> 01:44:04.402
The future's just fine with me.

01:44:04.474 --> 01:44:08.240
<i>And I have to say
that I find it vaguely amusing</i>

01:44:08.311 --> 01:44:11.975
that a computer that can
calculate the quadratic equation

01:44:12.048 --> 01:44:13.743
in a nanosecond

01:44:13.817 --> 01:44:17.219
<i>hits the panic button when it's
asked to count up to 2000.</i>

01:44:17.287 --> 01:44:20.279
[Laughs]
I'll see you upstairs.

01:44:20.357 --> 01:44:22.849
[Laughs]

01:44:22.926 --> 01:44:25.020
Well, anyway, sorry about this.

01:44:25.095 --> 01:44:26.961
<i>We've got to get up there.</i>

01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:28.259
-- Let's go.
Dana: Hang on.

01:44:28.331 --> 01:44:29.423
We gotta go.

01:44:29.499 --> 01:44:31.866
-- Jeremy, which button did you hit?
-- When?

01:44:31.935 --> 01:44:34.063
-- When the lights went out.
-- Uh, video release.

01:44:34.137 --> 01:44:35.400
-- Hmm.
-- Why?

01:44:36.506 --> 01:44:37.701
You didn't.

01:44:37.774 --> 01:44:39.367
-- Yes, I did.
-- No, you didn't.

01:44:39.442 --> 01:44:41.069
I was looking
right at the button.

01:44:41.144 --> 01:44:41.702
Yes.

01:44:41.778 --> 01:44:43.678
-- It said "video release."
-- Yes.

01:44:43.747 --> 01:44:44.873
It was video release.

01:44:44.948 --> 01:44:46.541
No. And I think
this is interesting.

01:44:46.616 --> 01:44:48.675
This section of the board
was rewired this morning.

01:44:48.752 --> 01:44:49.719
-- It was?
-- Yes.

01:44:49.786 --> 01:44:52.016
Why aren't the consoles
relabeled?

01:44:52.088 --> 01:44:53.988
As far as that's concerned,

01:44:54.057 --> 01:44:57.584
there's no question that there's a way
to look at this where it's my fault.

01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.321
What's another way
to look at it?

01:44:59.396 --> 01:45:01.797
There's no other way
to look at it.

01:45:01.865 --> 01:45:04.095
What button did I actually push?

01:45:04.167 --> 01:45:08.161
Now, <i>this</i> is where I think
you're gonna find some irony.

01:45:08.238 --> 01:45:10.172
It was the panic button?

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.504
Interestingly,
it was the panic button.

01:45:12.575 --> 01:45:14.543
-- Dana --
-- Hey, I said I was sorry.

01:45:14.611 --> 01:45:16.443
It was heartfelt.
I made an apology.

01:45:16.513 --> 01:45:18.675
-- <i>No, you didn't.</i> -- <i>Like I need
to apoiogize with you peopie.</i>

01:45:18.748 --> 01:45:19.738
Hang on.

01:45:21.084 --> 01:45:22.950
-- [ <i>Beeping</i> ]
<i>Casey: Yeah!</i>

01:45:23.019 --> 01:45:24.680
Ha ha!

01:45:24.754 --> 01:45:25.846
-- Dave!
-- Sound!

01:45:25.922 --> 01:45:27.048
<i>Chris: I've got sound.</i>

01:45:27.123 --> 01:45:28.716
-- <i>Will?</i>
-- We're online.

01:45:28.792 --> 01:45:29.782
<i>Let's gm!</i>

01:45:29.859 --> 01:45:32.794
Two minutes to VTR,
three minutes live.

01:45:32.862 --> 01:45:34.261
My home.

01:45:34.330 --> 01:45:35.661
<i>Dana: Jeremy...</i>

01:45:35.732 --> 01:45:37.097
I'm honestly sorry.

01:45:37.167 --> 01:45:38.965
-- There's no point in assigning blame.
-- What happened?

01:45:39.035 --> 01:45:40.230
It was Dana's fault!

01:45:40.303 --> 01:45:42.567
-- Show me Denver.
-- I am reinvigorated.

01:45:42.639 --> 01:45:45.836
You may have won the battle, but there's
a war still to be waged, my foe.

01:45:45.909 --> 01:45:47.570
<i>Honey, when you talk
to the computers,</i>

01:45:47.644 --> 01:45:49.408
you don't ever hear them
talk back, do you?

01:45:49.479 --> 01:45:50.605
-- No.
-- <i>Good.</i>

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.409
90 seconds to VTR!

01:45:52.482 --> 01:45:55.383
-- The human mind, Alyson.
It won't be denied. -- Good.

01:45:55.452 --> 01:45:57.079
-- It just won't.
-- Okay.

01:45:57.153 --> 01:45:59.144
You could try denying it, but
it won't work. You know why?

01:45:59.222 --> 01:46:01.884
-- 'Cause it's the human mind?
-- Damn straight.

01:46:01.958 --> 01:46:03.687
-- Can I go?
-- Yes.

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:04.591
Okay.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.935
Are you sure you don't want to
talk about anything?

01:46:14.003 --> 01:46:15.471
Yeah.

01:46:15.538 --> 01:46:17.563
You gonna see her again?

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.607
Yeah.

01:46:18.675 --> 01:46:19.904
Good.

01:46:19.976 --> 01:46:21.569
I think I may have
some stuff going on.

01:46:21.644 --> 01:46:23.237
I know.

01:46:23.313 --> 01:46:24.712
-- It's gonna be okay.
-- <i>I know.</i>

01:46:24.781 --> 01:46:27.250

<i>On the next "Sports Night"...</i>

How would you feel about my

editing out the part
where he doesn't like New York?

01:46:46.803 --> 01:46:47.668
No.

01:46:47.737 --> 01:46:49.330
Look, Arnold committed a bit
of a Big Apple faux pas,

01:46:49.405 --> 01:46:50.736
and Dana won't let me cut it.

01:46:50.807 --> 01:46:53.174
I'm undergoing
some kind of nervous collapse.

01:46:53.243 --> 01:46:54.802
I should kick your ass.

01:46:54.878 --> 01:46:56.243
<i>Kick his ass, Casey.</i>

01:46:58.948 --> 01:47:01.246
You're not making this
any easier.

01:47:01.317 --> 01:47:01.943
What's wrong?

01:47:02.018 --> 01:47:02.985
This is an emergency.

01:47:03.052 --> 01:47:05.180
The Vatican says
there's no such place as Hell.

01:47:05.255 --> 01:47:06.518
Well, that's a load
off my mind.
