01:30.920 --> 01:33.275
- Hello. Grand Hotel.
- The line is busy.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.239
Who is this?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.595
I can connect you with room service.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.638
Hello.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.389
Is that the clinic?
This is Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel.

01:49.760 --> 01:54.197
How's my wife? Is she in pain?
Isn't the child coming soon?

01:55.120 --> 01:57.395
Patience? Would you have patience?

01:57.480 --> 02:00.677
This is Otto Kringelein.
Is that you, Heinrich?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.310
Listen. I've got to talk very quickly.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.595
Every minute costs 2 marks 90.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.672
You know that will I made
before I had my operation?

02:08.759 --> 02:10.512
I want you to tear it up.

02:11.720 --> 02:16.157
I came to Berlin to see a great specialist
about that old trouble of mine, you know?

02:16.360 --> 02:20.069
It's pretty bad,
and he says I haven't long to live.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.039
I say, he says I won't live much longer!

02:24.560 --> 02:27.518
No, it isn't nice to be told things like that.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.509
You plague, bother, and save,
and all of a sudden you're dead.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.477
I want to get something out of life.

02:33.560 --> 02:37.155
I'm never going back
to Friedersdorf. Never.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.756
I'm staying here at the Grand Hotel.
It's the most expensive hotel in Berlin.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.750
All the best people stay here.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.477
Even our big boss, Preysing,
is staying here.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.637
I'm going to tell him someday
just exactly what I think of him.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.998
Hello, miss.

03:00.600 --> 03:04.832
This is General Director Preysing.
I want my home in Friedersdorf, please.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.429
Hurry.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.233
Hello. Is that you, Mama?
How are the children?

03:13.240 --> 03:15.549
What news have you
from the factory, dear?

03:16.560 --> 03:18.516
Is your papa there? Good.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.832
Hello, Papa, is that you?

03:22.000 --> 03:26.118
The conference with the Saxonia company
is set for tomorrow morning, Papa.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.752
If the merger does not go through,
we are in very bad shape, Papa.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.518
Everything depends upon news
from Manchester.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.675
If the deal with the Manchester
Cotton Company does not go through...

03:41.080 --> 03:43.913
we're facing a very bad situation, Papa.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.794
I'm Suzette, Mme. Grusinskaya's maid.
Madame will not dance today.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.678
She will not go to the rehearsal.
She did not sleep all night.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.751
There is something preying on her mind.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.479
I gave her a tablet, a Veronal.
She's sleeping now.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.517
This is Baron von Geigern.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.354
Look here, I need money,
or I can't stay at this hotel much longer.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.751
I've laid the groundwork.
I know the exact position of her room.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.990
I've made friends
with her ballet master, Pimenov.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.312
Listen, Heinrich.
I've taken all my savings, everything...

04:11.440 --> 04:14.318
and I'm going to enjoy spending it.
All of it.

04:15.080 --> 04:19.119
It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
But it's wonderful.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.710
I can't! I'll lose my job.
It's like being in jail.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.439
Rely on me, Papa.
I will make this merger go through.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.430
I never fail.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.318
Poor Madame. Her mind is tortured.
I'm afraid she will...

04:29.480 --> 04:31.835
I don't need advice, thanks very much.
I need money!

04:32.160 --> 04:35.516
Music all the time. It's wonderful.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.039
Grand Hotel.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.595
People coming, going.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.639
Nothing ever happens.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.312
Mme. Grusinskaya will not want her car.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.233
Mme. Grusinskaya's car
is not to be brought.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.990
- Here.
- Yes, Baron?

05:28.080 --> 05:30.753
- Adolphus is very vexed with you.
- Yes, Baron?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.876
You didn't take him for his walk
this morning.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.076
- Your door was locked.
- You might have knocked.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.675
Don't you realize? That's why
they don't like little dogs in big hotels.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.115
The doors are locked.
They can't get out. You see?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.555
- Yes, Baron.
- I want you to take him for a good walk.

05:43.640 --> 05:44.834
- You understand?
- Yes, Baron.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.639
- Don't bring him back till he's exhausted.
- No, Baron.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.153
Wait a minute.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.798
It's quite all right.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.474
- Hello?
- Is that for me?

05:54.560 --> 05:56.676
No. Mme. Grusinskaya's car
is to be brought.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.591
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.035
Good evening.
Will you send this to Mme. Grusinskaya?

06:01.120 --> 06:02.917
- Yes, Baron.
- Thanks very much.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.230
Good evening. My key, 168.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.675
- Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
- Good evening, Baron.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.433
- How is the beautiful lady?
- Grusinskaya?

06:10.520 --> 06:13.318
To tell the truth, Baron,
tonight we're a little bit nervous.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.879
Were you at the theater last night?

06:14.960 --> 06:16.951
I'm always there
when Grusinskaya dances.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.430
- Last night was not so good.
- I thought she was splendid.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.631
Is Mr. Preysing in? I'm Dr. Zinnowitz.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.597
- Mr. Preysing. Visitor.
- Mr. Preysing.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.830
- Here you are.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.150
Waiting? I've been waiting for news
from Manchester.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.514
- No news yet?
- No news.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.070
That's bad. You can't hold out unless
you merge with the Saxonia company.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.754
- I know.
- The Saxonia company will never sign...

06:38.840 --> 06:41.308
unless your firm is tied up
with the Manchester people.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.913
They don't have to. I told you that.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.278
Yes, I know. I'm very much worried.
But I have my agent in Manchester.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.476
I'm expecting a telegram any minute.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.353
You have to create a good impression.
Seem optimistic.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.512
Don't even mention Manchester
to the Saxonia crowd. Be clever.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.955
No, I cannot do that, Dr. Zinnowitz.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.713
I'm used to making my deals
on a solid basis.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.718
I'm an honest businessman,
a good husband and a father.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.315
I have nothing to conceal.
I could not live happily otherwise.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.834
Yes, I know.
We'll go someplace and talk it over.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.148
I'm expecting a stenographer.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.312
Send her to Mr. Preysing's room. 166.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.958
Yes, Dr. Zinnowitz.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.555
- Letters for me?
- No, Doctor.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.392
- Telegrams?
- No, Doctor.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.471
He always seems to be waiting
for something...

07:23.560 --> 07:24.629
but it never happens.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.597
- No messages?
- No, Doctor.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.674
Yes, I was in the war.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.479
- Your bill, Baron.
- You're not beginning that again, are you?

07:31.560 --> 07:33.630
Please pay some attention to me.
I've no time.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.551
Kindly wait one moment, sir.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.114
- Has anyone asked for me?
- No, Doctor.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.919
We're holding the rooms now.
Five bedrooms, two sitting rooms.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.958
- How many in your party?
- Let me see. My mother, two sisters...

07:44.040 --> 07:47.237
- Really, this is an imposition.
- Sir, kindly wait one moment, please.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.912
- That makes nine.
- Yes, madam.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.072
- You wish to have the rooms held?
- Yes, please. And then...

07:52.600 --> 07:56.115
Really, I won't wait any longer.
I've been here a very long time.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.758
That's all right.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.633
Look here, I waited three days
before I got a room at all.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.950
When I finally got one,
what kind of a room was it?

08:03.040 --> 08:06.271
- A very nice room, and inexpensive.
- I didn't ask you for a cheap room.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.114
When I came here to live,
did I ask you for a cheap room? Did I?

08:10.360 --> 08:12.999
- If you wait one moment, sir...
- I can't wait.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.674
Every day is precious. Every hour...

08:15.760 --> 08:17.830
- 176?
...every minute is precious.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.357
I came to live here for two weeks,
maybe three. Heaven only knows.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.592
I can pay whatever you want.
I'm tired and ill. I can't wait.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.990
- The gentleman has a complaint?
- He is dissatisfied with Room 559.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.152
Yes, I have a complaint.
I think it's a perfectly fair complaint.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.676
I came here from a great distance
to live at the Grand Hotel.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.716
I want a room, a big room.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.596
The same kind of room
you'd give General Director Preysing.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.909
I'm as good as Mr. Preysing.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.037
I can pay for a room
the same as Mr. Preysing.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.237
Would you stick him way off
in a corner in a little room...

08:52.320 --> 08:54.356
where the water pipes go "pop" all day?

08:55.720 --> 08:58.109
He can have my room.
It doesn't matter where I stay.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.553
That won't be necessary, Doctor.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.428
Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176.
It's one of our most expensive rooms.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.432
A large room on the front, and with a bar.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.308
- With a private bar, exclusively mine.
- Certainly, sir.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.233
Exactly what I want. That's very kind.
I'll pay for it now.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.312
- No, I beg of you, sir.
- Pardon me, sir.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.676
You dropped your little hat.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.471
- Permit me.
- Thank you.

09:21.560 --> 09:25.109
Permit me. My name is Kringelein,
from Friedersdorf.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.397
- Yes. I'm Baron von Geigern.
- A Baron.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.715
Permit me to present Dr. Otternschlag.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.394
A doctor. Doctor, I'm ill.

09:35.480 --> 09:39.837
I know. When a man's collar
is an inch too big for him, I know he's ill.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.559
I must go and dress now.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.631
- I hope to see you at the theater.
- Surely, sir.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.633
- Is this gentleman a baron, too?
- Unfortunately, no.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.871
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here?
- I have signed once.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.439
- Have you a minute?
- I told you not to come into the lobby.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.669
Time's getting short.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.672
Haven't I told you not talk to me
with a cigarette in your mouth?

10:01.760 --> 10:03.557
- I want to speak...
- Later.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.789
Yes, sir.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.591
This way, Mr. Kringelein.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.674
Mr. Preysing.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.194
- Will you go up to 166?
- 166.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.113
Hey, wait a minute!

10:24.680 --> 10:25.749
Hello?

10:26.120 --> 10:28.793
Mme. Grusinskaya's car
is not to be brought.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.549
She said, "On the other side of the fence."

10:40.840 --> 10:42.831
Baron, you're incorrigible.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.798
Poor Grusinskaya.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.676
- How can she receive anyone? She can't.
- No, of course not.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.991
Theater, hotels, trains.
Trains, hotels, theater.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.672
- Quite so.
- I must toddle along.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.389
- She'll be waking up and calling for me.
- I'm sorry, old fellow.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.952
Who are you, please?

11:29.640 --> 11:30.834
I'm the stenographer.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.435
Then you will please wait outside, please.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.349
Yes, sir.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.517
Outside, please.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.279
Take your time.

11:49.800 --> 11:54.430
Listen, the burial fund and everything.
I've got it right here.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.394
I'm going to live.
I'm going to have a good time while I can.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.631
That's my creed, Kringelein:
A short life and a gay one.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.193
A short life, Baron, and a gay one.
That's very true in my case.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.635
You know, I know you won't think
I'm impertinent...

12:08.720 --> 12:11.757
but perhaps you might have
a little better time...

12:11.880 --> 12:16.670
if you bought some new clothes.
Started out fresh, so to speak.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.037
Well, Baron, I didn't think
there was time for that.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.793
But it's very kind of you
to take an interest.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.233
- Friends, then.
- Friends, Baron?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.355
Thank you.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.908
- Your room is ready, sir.
- Thank you.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.838
I may speak to the Baron
anytime I see him?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.791
Of course, Kringelein. Why not?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.758
I mean,
when you're with your smart friends?

12:42.440 --> 12:46.592
- I haven't any friends, Kringelein.
- You said me, Baron.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.078
- Friend.
- Bless you, Kringelein.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.753
See you later.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.794
I've often wondered
what would happen to that porter...

13:06.880 --> 13:09.314
if somebody jumped on him from here.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.356
I'm sure I don't know.
Why don't you try it and find out?

13:15.320 --> 13:17.470
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.789
- Don't you like dancing?
- No. Not with strangers.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.199
- Never?
- Never.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.194
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.237
- I say...
- Are you back again?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.158
He must be an awful nice fellow.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.629
- Who?
- Whoever's keeping you waiting.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.759
Have you seen it?

13:55.840 --> 13:57.990
- Seen what?
- It.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.830
You don't mean 166?

14:00.920 --> 14:03.593
That fat,
bulbous neighbor of mine, Mister...

14:04.440 --> 14:06.829
- Preysing.
- Not you.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.199
Oh, no.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.149
Work.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.471
- Does he sing?
- I hope not.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.518
- Weren't you playing something?
- Yes. The typewriter.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.399
- You're a little stenographess.
- Yes, I'm a little stenographess.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.118
That's fascinating.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.273
I don't suppose you'd take some dictation
from me sometime, would you?

14:32.240 --> 14:35.676
- How about some tea, then?
- Tea would spoil my dinner.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.759
I only have one meal a day,
and I'd rather hate to spoil it.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.308
- Are you reducing?
- Reducing?

14:43.080 --> 14:44.638
Me? Do I need to?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.994
No. It's perfect.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.631
I don't think I've ever...

14:51.720 --> 14:53.995
But why one meal a day?

14:54.320 --> 14:57.596
- Money. Ever heard of it?
- Yes, I have, vaguely.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.798
But I always thought
little stenographers made little pennies.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.155
- Very little.
- That's too bad.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.557
Did you ever see a stenographer
with a decent frock on?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.073
I have, indeed.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.031
One she'd bought herself?

15:12.520 --> 15:15.080
I see what you mean. Poor kid.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.593
- I wish I were free tonight.
- Aren't you?

15:20.640 --> 15:22.631
- What?
- Free.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.998
No, darn it, I'm not.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.238
But there's tomorrow.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.078
- What time tomorrow?
- 5:00, downstairs.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.708
Where downstairs?

15:35.800 --> 15:38.109
In the funny yellow room
where they dance.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.039
You're funny.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.829
- Tomorrow?
- Of course.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.555
Really?

15:48.160 --> 15:49.991
We'll dance?

15:51.720 --> 15:53.711
All right. We'll dance.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.039
I wonder if I could remind the Baron
of his promise...

16:02.120 --> 16:04.076
that I might speak to him at any time?

16:04.160 --> 16:07.038
Mr. Kringelein, how are you making out
in the royal suite?

16:07.120 --> 16:09.839
- Wonderfully, thanks to the Baron.
- Baron?

16:11.080 --> 16:14.390
- Are you a baron?
- Strangely enough, yes.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.273
- Then this isn't the Baroness?
- Strangely enough, no.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.076
- Do I look like a baroness?
- You're attractive enough to be anything.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.754
Thank you, Baron. You're nice.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.555
- Thank you, Miss...
- Miss Flaemm.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.878
- Miss Flaemm, this is Mr. Kringelein.
- Hello.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.313
- They call me Flaemmchen.
- I like that better.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.916
I wonder if the Baron would take
the trouble to come to my beautiful room?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.991
I've ordered some caviar and champagne.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.799
It's very expensive,
but that doesn't matter.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.189
Perhaps Miss Flaemm would join us.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.999
Have caviar, if you like,
but it tastes like herring to me.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.436
It does, as a matter of fact.
I hadn't thought of that.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.752
I'm sure my beautiful room...

16:56.840 --> 16:59.912
will appeal to your artistic sense.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.116
It has real velvet upholstery.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.317
A-number one.
I'm in the textile trade, and I know.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.519
I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?

17:12.560 --> 17:16.997
It has hot and cold running water all day.
Nighttime, too.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.991
I can have a bath anytime that I like.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.273
- No.
- Yes.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.390
Stenographer. Please.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.876
Her master's voice.
Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein. Thank you.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.995
Goodbye, funny one.
Don't forget tomorrow. 5:00.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.275
- I won't. Goodbye, you.
- Goodbye.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.918
- What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
- Preysing.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.316
- You know him, don't you?
- I know him?

17:53.400 --> 17:57.279
I've slaved in that man's factory
for years and years.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.675
I know him through and through.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.673
- Sorry, old man.
- I beg your pardon, Baron.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.834
Excuse me.
Won't you join me in my room?

18:05.920 --> 18:07.512
I've ordered some champagne.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.068
Listen, I'd love to. I'll join you a little later.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.993
You know the gentleman
we met downstairs, with the face?

18:13.080 --> 18:14.559
- Who? The doctor, you mean?
- Yes.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.632
- He's a gay old blade, isn't he?
- He's wonderful.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.120
Please, <i>Messieurs</i>, Madame is asleep.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.073
See you later.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.791
- Waiter!
- Please.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.035
Sorry.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.512
Has Madame slept well?

19:01.040 --> 19:03.679
No, I've been awake, thinking.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.635
It is time for the performance.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.198
I think, Suzette...

19:13.720 --> 19:16.439
I've never been so tired in my life.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.313
Not even the Veronal
can help me to sleep.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.637
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.990
- I can't dance tonight.
- It will pass, Madame.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.273
Pearls are cold.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.595
Everything is cold and finished.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.193
So far away.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.431
So threadbare.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.478
The Russians. Saint Petersburg.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.918
Imperial court. The Grand Duke Sergei...

20:28.520 --> 20:29.748
Sergei...

20:31.120 --> 20:32.314
is dead.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.433
It's all gone.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.273
<i>Mon Dieu.</i> The pearls,
if they were to break...

20:44.000 --> 20:47.834
The pearls don't break.
They hold together and bring me bad luck.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.519
I hate them.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.835
Orchids again, Madame!

20:53.120 --> 20:56.351
No card. I think they are perhaps
from the same young man.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.989
He is at the end of the corridor.
Tall. He walks like a soldier.

21:00.080 --> 21:04.039
Madame must have noticed
how often he rides in the elevator with us.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.713
Yes? <i>Oui.</i>

21:10.040 --> 21:13.510
- Madame, the car is here.
- Send it away. I shan't need it.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.196
Mme. Grusinskaya will not require her car.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.874
No. She'll not be going to the theater.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.193
- Time for the performance.
- The performance.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.518
Poor little Lisebeta.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.672
She still has her stage fright. It will pass.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.397
- It's not stage fright. It's something more.
- What? What is it?

21:36.480 --> 21:39.597
- Last night there was no applause.
- There was.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.156
That theater, half empty.
Dancing for those few.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.073
I was frantic.

21:50.200 --> 21:53.112
I finished, I waited, I listened...

21:54.760 --> 21:57.718
but the applause did not come. Nothing.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.829
They're past, Pimenov.
They're dead. It's finished.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.714
Meierheim.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.719
Madame! In negligée
an hour before the performance.

22:11.800 --> 22:16.078
What's this, you're canceling your car?
Do you know the time, or are we all mad?

22:16.160 --> 22:19.630
Am I your manager?
Have we contracts? Have we obligations?

22:20.680 --> 22:24.355
- Is this the time, or I am blind?
- I'm canceling the engagement.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.030
Madame is canceling the engagement?

22:28.120 --> 22:31.351
Madame has chosen a funny time
for such a funny joke.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.955
Tonight there is a line
in front of the theater since 6:00.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.590
The house is jammed to the roof.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.634
- Is it really full?
- Doesn't Meierheim say so?

22:43.080 --> 22:45.799
Packed to the ceiling.
And such an audience:

22:45.920 --> 22:48.718
The French ambassador,
American millionaires, Princess Retski...

22:48.800 --> 22:50.028
All right.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.629
- Hurry, Suzette.
- We'll wait outside.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.755
Poor child.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.997
- How is the house?
- Terrible.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.311
After this, no more ballets for me.
Jazz. Just jazz.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.392
If the house is empty again...
I don't know.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.074
When she gets her paint on,
hears the music, she'll be fine.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.469
I know these people. Here she is.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.475
Why did you bring the pearls?
I said I won't wear them.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.834
- Why not?
- Take them back.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.672
- Hurry up.
- We haven't time.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.434
I don't think I'll be able
to join you fellows after all.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.636
- Why not? We'll wait.
- Come on.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.197
- Lift, please.
- Wait.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.234
Can I help?

23:57.480 --> 24:00.040
You go ahead, old man.
I'll be there if I'm up for it.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.190
- We'll meet anyway.
- All right.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.752
Mme. Grusinskaya's car.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.113
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.237
The car is here, Madame.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.789
Hello. Fifth floor. Good evening.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.592
It's just 9:30, madam.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.950
Yes. I'll send them up at once.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.278
- Is he in?
- The Baron?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.628
- Yes.
- Yes.

25:10.080 --> 25:14.119
Adolphus, I have something very serious
to discuss with you.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.949
When you meet lady dogs on the street
that are not dachshunds...

25:18.440 --> 25:21.000
you must exercise some self-control.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.319
We have company.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.748
You're late.
The dancer's gone to the theater.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.512
Excuse me, I'm busy.

25:32.280 --> 25:36.034
This is a very peculiar thing
for one gentleman to say to another...

25:36.120 --> 25:37.951
but as a matter of fact...

25:38.040 --> 25:41.953
you're the one thing in the world
I really love.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.953
She's gone to the theater.
Don't you know?

25:45.400 --> 25:47.914
- What are you going to do?
- The pearls are in her room.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.513
The others are getting suspicious.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.989
I had Amsterdam on the phone.
They think you're scared.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.798
I've been careful. I'm waiting my chance.

25:53.880 --> 25:57.156
Waiting your chance? You're too much
of a gentleman, that's the trouble.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.470
I told you I'd get those pearls tonight,
didn't I?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.198
- Need any help?
- No.

26:01.480 --> 26:02.754
Have you got the skeleton key?

26:02.840 --> 26:03.989
- No.
- Why not?

26:04.120 --> 26:08.352
One reason: There's a perfectly charming
floor clerk outside who sees everything.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.238
She'd see me enter her room.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.878
- I can take care of her.
- How?

26:11.960 --> 26:14.190
Chloroform on a handkerchief
while you're on the job.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.952
- No.
- Why not?

26:16.200 --> 26:19.397
Poor kid. In the first place,
it would give her a rotten headache.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.517
I know all about chloroform.
I had it in the war.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.432
Besides, she's rather pretty.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.318
- She has a very nice line...
- You're no good for this business.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.516
- No?
- To you it's just a joke.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.911
I don't like your tone.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.592
- No?
- No.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.950
Get out. Leave her to me.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.837
Be ready to leave on the night train
for Amsterdam.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.713
- With the pearls.
- With the pearls.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.874
Get out.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.999
There is a nasty man, Adolphus.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.918
He'd eat his young.

27:15.960 --> 27:19.919
"Both parties have fully agreed
that this merger can only result...

27:20.520 --> 27:23.876
"in mutual advantages.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.073
"Moreover..."

27:36.240 --> 27:38.993
- Did you get that?
- Yes, I got it.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.672
What did you say Zinnowitz called you?

27:42.880 --> 27:44.029
Flaemmchen.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.759
- Flaemm? That's odd.
- What?

27:47.560 --> 27:52.031
I mean, who were the gentlemen
you were talking to in the corridor?

27:52.280 --> 27:53.633
Some people I know.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.593
- You know a lot of gentlemen, don't you?
- Oh, not many.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.712
I haven't time.
I'm busy now looking for a job.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.957
I'd love to be in the movies.

28:02.920 --> 28:06.310
Why the movies particularly? I mean...

28:07.640 --> 28:10.438
"...only in mutual advantages.
Moreover..."

28:11.880 --> 28:14.110
You're a very unusual stenographer.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.998
You're pretty enough to do other things.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.236
- I do.
- What?

28:19.640 --> 28:22.438
You see, I have a rather nice figure,
and I pose a lot.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.272
Art studies, you know?

28:24.360 --> 28:26.749
Like that? I got 10 marks for it.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.877
Is that you? You?

28:30.640 --> 28:32.756
Well, isn't that interesting?

28:33.360 --> 28:35.510
- That's lovely.
- "Moreover..."

28:39.200 --> 28:43.716
"Moreover, the possibility
of the successful accommodation...

28:44.040 --> 28:45.314
"for the Cotton Company...

28:45.400 --> 28:48.517
"should throw a great weight
into the balance..."

28:52.800 --> 28:55.234
"Balance."

28:55.320 --> 28:58.153
Your hands are sunburned, aren't they?

28:58.240 --> 29:00.356
- Yes, that's from skiing.
- From skiing?

29:00.440 --> 29:03.079
A friend of mine
took me to Switzerland last month.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.038
To Switzerland?
That must have been very nice.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.232
I went to Florence once, too.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.118
- With the same man?
- No.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.238
Don't misunderstand me, Miss Flaemm.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.629
I'm a married man
and have grown-up daughters...

29:17.720 --> 29:20.029
- All right.
...bigger than you are.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.349
Come in.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.431
That's all. Excuse me, please.

29:51.200 --> 29:54.431
"Deal with Manchester definitely off."
Is that something terrible?

29:54.520 --> 29:57.034
It doesn't mean that at all.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.908
- That's a mistake. That's wrong.
- All right. I'm sorry.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.272
- Do you want to go on?
- No.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.391
You come back in the morning...

30:07.480 --> 30:10.995
and we will go on with the dictation
before the conference.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.993
If you find out you won't need me
in the morning...

30:16.080 --> 30:17.559
I wish you'd please let me know...

30:17.640 --> 30:20.871
because men like you who come in
and out of town are often unreliable.

30:20.960 --> 30:24.509
After all, if I don't work tomorrow...
Well, good night.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.159
"Deal definitely off."

30:32.840 --> 30:35.991
Why, we could be smashed.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.593
I'm going into 170 now, madam.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.476
Hello? No. There's no one here.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.192
You're late. What have you been doing?

33:17.280 --> 33:20.909
Everyone says, "Come back."
They won't get out of their rooms.

33:25.480 --> 33:28.836
Housekeeper speaking. No, she isn't here.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.349
- Western Theater?
- Have you seen Madame?

33:32.880 --> 33:34.199
Hello. Mr. Pimenov?

33:34.280 --> 33:37.352
Have you found her?
No, she isn't here. Yes, I know...

33:37.480 --> 33:41.473
Pimenov? What's happening?
No, I haven't found her.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.518
Who's dancing? Duprez? How was it?

33:45.120 --> 33:47.350
Good. All right. You keep the show going.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.273
This trick is going to cost Madame
a suit for breach of contract.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.669
- Madame is ill. Her nerves...
- What about my nerves?

33:52.760 --> 33:55.718
Who is she?
Where does she think she is, Russia?

34:00.720 --> 34:03.393
- I want to be alone.
- Where have you been?

34:04.880 --> 34:07.348
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.078
I just want to be alone.

34:09.159 --> 34:13.119
You're going to be very much alone,
my dear Madame. This is the end.

34:24.280 --> 34:27.351
- Shall I... Does Madame wish...
- No, Suzette.

34:29.639 --> 34:30.914
All right.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.877
Western Theater, please.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.869
Mr. Pimenov, the ballet master.
Grusinskaya.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.878
Hello, Pimenov.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.833
I'm at the hotel.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.560
I couldn't go on. I couldn't.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.233
How is it going?

36:06.760 --> 36:09.115
Who's dancing? Duprez?

36:10.320 --> 36:11.833
Well, how is it?

36:17.480 --> 36:18.595
I see.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.871
They didn't miss me at all.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.552
Good night, Pimenov.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.274
They didn't even miss me.

36:43.640 --> 36:46.154
Yes. I'm sorry. I've finished.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.753
Finished.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.678
I always said I'd leave off
when the time came.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.678
And who would trouble
about a Grusinskaya...

37:03.160 --> 37:04.957
who dances no more?

37:07.240 --> 37:08.832
What would she do?

37:10.160 --> 37:11.559
Grow orchids?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.352
Keep white peacocks?

37:16.640 --> 37:17.629
Die.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.315
That's what it comes to at last: To die.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.352
I'm not going to wait.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.031
Don't be alarmed, Madame.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.269
Who are you?

37:36.360 --> 37:38.828
Someone who happened
to be hiding in your room.

37:38.920 --> 37:39.909
Why?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.560
I often come here
when you're at the theater.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.709
Why?

37:43.800 --> 37:47.395
Just to be alone in your room,
to breathe the air you breathe.

37:48.880 --> 37:52.475
There's no need to call for help.
Permit me. I couldn't help hearing.

37:52.560 --> 37:56.030
I couldn't help knowing
what you were about to do just now.

37:57.440 --> 38:01.672
I could have left by the window,
unnoticed, but I risked being discovered.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.197
May I say something, Madame?
You're so beautiful.

38:06.040 --> 38:09.077
It tore my heart
to see you in despair like that.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.953
What on earth
have they been doing to you?

38:19.240 --> 38:22.949
You've everything to live for.
Please don't cry anymore.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.518
You must forgive me.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.355
I've had a very trying evening.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.517
I was so alone,
and suddenly you were there.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.350
Why do you look at me like that?

38:46.080 --> 38:48.514
I had no idea you were so beautiful.

38:49.080 --> 38:53.437
I'd like to take you in my arms
and not let anything happen to you, ever.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.592
How tired you are.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.673
Yes, tired.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.755
And alone?

39:02.760 --> 39:03.954
So alone.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.515
You mustn't talk Russian to me.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.957
Strange man.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.357
Am I so strange to you?

39:18.920 --> 39:20.831
Maybe not so strange now.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.592
You know, once,
when the Grand Duke was alive...

39:26.360 --> 39:29.397
I found a man hiding in my room,
a young officer.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.350
Later on, they found him dead.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.357
Well, that was Russia.

39:42.480 --> 39:46.234
- Who are you?
- Someone who can love you, that's all.

39:47.880 --> 39:51.077
Someone who has forgotten
everything else but you.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.232
You could love me?

39:54.680 --> 39:58.275
I've never seen anything in my life
as beautiful as you are.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.193
You must go now.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.994
I'm not going. You know I'm not going.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.512
Please let me stay.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.718
But I want to be alone.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.995
That isn't true. You don't want to be alone.

40:24.080 --> 40:27.390
You were in despair just now.
I can't leave you now.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.877
You mustn't cry anymore.
You must forget.

40:33.200 --> 40:36.033
Let me stay. Just for a little while.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.078
Please let me stay.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.951
For just a minute, then.

40:58.800 --> 40:59.949
No, Doctor.

41:00.600 --> 41:04.195
The champagne,
and those girls and their dancing...

41:04.280 --> 41:08.558
those beautiful silver things,
and the ice, and the caviar...

41:08.640 --> 41:10.119
Oh, Doctor.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.999
I don't care.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.751
It's life. Life.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.957
Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.991
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.878
- No. My room.
- Yes, Doctor.

41:54.520 --> 41:57.080
Mr. Kringelein, you're drunk.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.869
Life.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.353
Grand Hotel.

43:39.040 --> 43:40.155
Hello?

43:41.280 --> 43:42.395
Grand Hotel.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.038
Grand Hotel, good morning.

43:44.120 --> 43:46.429
Baron von Geigern's room
does not answer.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.153
Yes, all right.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.038
Baron von Geigern's chauffeur calling?

43:53.640 --> 43:55.392
Grand Hotel, good morning.

43:55.680 --> 43:59.673
930, Dr. Otternschlag.
No, Doctor. No messages.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.070
Grand Hotel, 820.

44:05.360 --> 44:09.672
Grand Hotel, good morning.
Who is calling Mme. Grusinskaya?

44:10.360 --> 44:14.273
Mr. Pimenov.
Mme. Grusinskaya cannot be disturbed.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.079
Mr. Preysing's calls to 162 for the day.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.957
- 162.
- The conference room.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.628
That is interesting.

44:20.720 --> 44:23.871
A man in the textile industry
must know Manchester.

44:23.960 --> 44:27.714
There's a lot of business to be done
with the Manchester Cotton Company.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.593
They have the whole English market
right in their hands.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.750
Have you any connections
with Manchester?

44:32.840 --> 44:35.149
We have a lot of good connections
in England.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.959
- Actually...
- I mean, with the Manchester people.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.510
Please, we are here to discuss the merger.
Let us begin at the beginning.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.669
- Yes.
- Thank you.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.352
Is Baron von Geigern in?

44:47.560 --> 44:48.675
Too bad.

44:48.760 --> 44:51.718
Since June 11 this year,
when the first negotiation...

44:51.800 --> 44:52.949
I met him yesterday.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.634
...between our respective firms...

44:55.840 --> 44:56.909
I've got a date.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.513
...that this merger can result...

44:58.600 --> 45:00.033
About 5:00.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.838
...all of us.
- Dancing.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.872
- All we want to know about is Manchester.
- Just a second.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.389
Before I get through,
I'm laying before you here...

45:07.480 --> 45:09.675
the last general statement of the concern.

45:09.760 --> 45:12.354
The capital, the plant, the machinery...

45:12.480 --> 45:15.597
For instance, we'll take mop rags.

45:17.600 --> 45:20.319
- I'll call you back.
- All we want to know about is Manchester.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.755
Yes, Mr. Preysing,
that's what we want to know.

45:22.840 --> 45:25.229
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz...

45:25.320 --> 45:27.914
before I commit myself, please.

45:28.360 --> 45:31.432
Now, to go ahead with the merger.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.155
You realize...

45:34.240 --> 45:38.711
that this merger is a great advantage
to the Saxonians, of course.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.831
Now, let's talk like adults.

45:40.920 --> 45:44.469
- When you first approached us...
- We did not approach you.

45:44.560 --> 45:47.313
This letter filed on September 15
indicates you approached us.

45:47.400 --> 45:50.312
That letter is a response
to a tentative feeler sent out by you.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.152
- Please.
- Tentative, my foot!

45:52.240 --> 45:54.310
A month before this,
your old father-in-law...

45:54.400 --> 45:58.029
- comes to me privately, and scratches...
- Scratched?

45:58.120 --> 46:00.839
- Why, we did not take the initiative!
- You did...

46:00.920 --> 46:03.514
- We did not take the initiative!
- You took the initiative!

46:03.600 --> 46:06.239
Gentlemen, I see the conference
has already begun.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.312
- I'm glad you're here, Justice Zinnowitz.
- Good morning.

46:10.440 --> 46:13.432
- Thank you very much.
- I beg your pardon, please.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.593
Excuse me, please. I am glad you're here.

46:18.040 --> 46:21.828
These gentlemen have cross words.
Would you try, Justice Zinnowitz...

46:21.920 --> 46:23.990
- and iron out the situation here?
- Certainly.

46:24.080 --> 46:26.116
- Right here, on the top.
- If you will allow me.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.235
Thank you.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.956
Well, gentlemen, the situation
seems to be perfectly clear.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.112
- Yes. And how clear is Manchester?
- Manchester?

46:34.200 --> 46:36.668
Have you said anything
about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

46:36.760 --> 46:40.469
Why, no, sir. I cannot commit myself
at this time about Manchester.

46:40.560 --> 46:44.917
Quite right. Well, gentlemen,
since June 11 of this year...

46:45.120 --> 46:47.759
when the first negotiations for a merger
were entered...

46:47.840 --> 46:50.274
Now we're going to begin
at the beginning again.

46:50.360 --> 46:52.237
As you remember it,
when you approached us...

46:52.320 --> 46:55.278
- We did not approach you.
- I'm sorry, you did approach us!

46:55.360 --> 46:57.351
We did not approach you.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.715
- You approached us!
- Please wait.

47:01.160 --> 47:03.720
Can you imagine 100 girls
in a ballet school...

47:03.800 --> 47:07.713
each thinking she would become
the most famous dancer in the world?

47:09.400 --> 47:11.118
I was ambitious then.

47:12.120 --> 47:15.795
We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.

47:17.800 --> 47:21.475
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.916
Then I became famous soon.

47:28.120 --> 47:30.429
But why am I telling you all this?

47:31.240 --> 47:33.629
Last night I didn't know you at all.

47:34.600 --> 47:37.398
- Who are you, really?
- What?

47:39.480 --> 47:41.516
I don't even know your name.

47:45.240 --> 47:48.676
I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.391
My mother called me Flix.

47:51.880 --> 47:54.110
No. Flix.

47:54.520 --> 47:56.078
That's sweet.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.636
And how do you live?
What kind of person are you?

48:01.160 --> 48:04.709
I'm a prodigal son,
the black sheep of a white flock.

48:05.320 --> 48:08.039
I shall die on the gallows.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.558
- Really?
- Really.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.638
I haven't a bit of character. None at all.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.358
- No?
- No. Really.

48:15.480 --> 48:19.871
You know, when I was a little boy
I was taught to ride and be a gentleman.

48:20.200 --> 48:23.670
Then at school, to pray and lie.

48:24.360 --> 48:27.352
And then in the war, to kill and hide.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.159
That's all.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.311
And what do you do now?

48:34.040 --> 48:36.110
Now I'm a gambler...

48:36.960 --> 48:39.394
running at large, like a happy pig...

48:39.720 --> 48:42.518
devouring everything of life
that pleases me.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.117
I really belong in jail.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.479
What a picture.

48:49.640 --> 48:51.551
And what else?

48:53.040 --> 48:54.314
What else?

49:14.640 --> 49:18.110
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.197
That's not a funny joke.

49:24.200 --> 49:26.236
You must believe one thing.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.996
You must believe that I love you.

49:29.400 --> 49:33.075
That I've never known love like this
until now.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.072
What is it, Flix? What's the matter?

49:42.240 --> 49:43.559
Hotel thief.

49:50.880 --> 49:51.869
No.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.029
Did you come here just for these?

50:01.880 --> 50:03.393
That's horrible.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.759
You may keep the pearls.
I don't want them.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.591
I will not denounce you.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.471
Hadn't you better go now?

50:15.520 --> 50:17.351
I wanted money desperately.

50:17.440 --> 50:20.477
Can't you understand that?
That's why I wanted your pearls.

50:20.560 --> 50:21.675
I was threatened.

50:21.760 --> 50:25.036
I was desperately in need
of a certain big sum of money.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.919
I've been following you. I've admired you.

50:28.120 --> 50:32.079
But last night, at last,
I managed to come into your room.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.914
And now...

50:36.720 --> 50:37.914
And now?

50:39.360 --> 50:41.510
I couldn't go through with it.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.318
Don't you understand?

50:49.040 --> 50:50.314
Don't you?

51:47.120 --> 51:49.190
- Who?
- Suzette, Madame.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.998
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Madame.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.832
- Did Madame sleep well?
- Yes, Suzette.

51:52.920 --> 51:56.196
Come back in five minutes. I'll call you.
Five minutes.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.472
There, it begins.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.513
Hello, Pimenov. Good morning.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.393
Darling.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.073
Beautiful morning. Yes, very well.

52:13.080 --> 52:16.117
Rehearsals? All right,
you can come. Goodbye.

52:18.720 --> 52:22.395
I have to go to rehearsals.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.516
- Our train?
- Yes, for Vienna.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.795
- Vienna?
- You're coming with me.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.030
- Of course you are.
- But I can't.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.634
I'd give my soul to go, but I can't.

52:31.880 --> 52:35.395
- Why couldn't you?
- I'll try. There might be some way.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.430
- Flix, is it money?
- Of course.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.477
I have money.
I have enough for both of us.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.471
No. That would spoil everything.

52:45.560 --> 52:49.872
I'll manage somehow. I'll get it.
I have a whole day. I'll be on the train.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.308
I shall dance, and you'll be with me.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.912
Then we'll go to Tremezzo.
I have a villa there.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.758
The sun will shine.

53:01.120 --> 53:04.556
I'll take a vacation,
six weeks, eight weeks. I don't know.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.551
We'll be happy and lazy.

53:07.600 --> 53:11.309
And then we'll go to South America.
It will be divine.

53:13.760 --> 53:16.877
- Be careful going to your room.
- I'll be on the train with the money.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.029
Don't do anything foolish.

53:18.120 --> 53:21.430
- I'm alarmed about you.
- Don't worry. I'll be on the train.

53:55.720 --> 53:59.076
Hurry, Suzette.
A bright dress. It's a sunny morning.

54:04.760 --> 54:07.115
Meierheim is canceling
the Vienna engagement.

54:07.200 --> 54:11.318
Meierheim is mad.
You are mad. We're all mad.

54:12.080 --> 54:13.513
Suzette, come.

54:20.760 --> 54:22.955
Gru, you're positively radiant.

54:23.920 --> 54:27.151
Pimenov, I have an idea, a ballet.

54:27.600 --> 54:30.910
It must have mad music...
But I'll speak with you later.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.353
You go to the theater.

54:32.440 --> 54:36.228
I want a full rehearsal,
ballet, full orchestra...

54:36.320 --> 54:38.356
- Come, Suzette.
- But, Madame...

54:46.200 --> 54:48.873
Will you get me
Baron von Geigern, please?

54:50.640 --> 54:53.677
Yes. Baron von Geigern.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.874
<i>Chéri</i>, it's you.

55:06.960 --> 55:08.279
No, nothing.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.797
Good morning.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.069
No.

55:14.440 --> 55:17.318
Just to tell you that I'm happy.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.194
I'll have something sweet and cold, please.

55:42.280 --> 55:44.919
- Louisiana Flip, sir?
- Louisiana Flip?

55:45.080 --> 55:47.878
Yes, that sounds very nice. Thank you.

55:48.400 --> 55:50.960
What do you do in the Grand Hotel?

55:51.440 --> 55:54.591
Eat, sleep, loaf around...

55:55.560 --> 55:58.154
flirt a little, dance a little.

55:59.080 --> 56:01.719
A hundred doors leading to one hall.

56:02.640 --> 56:05.438
No one knows anything
about the person next to them.

56:06.880 --> 56:10.316
And when you leave,
someone occupies your room...

56:10.600 --> 56:12.238
lies in your bed.

56:13.480 --> 56:14.959
That's the end.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.194
Let me say again, for the tenth time...

56:22.280 --> 56:24.271
you people were quite ready
for the merger.

56:24.360 --> 56:27.318
You declared yourself fully agreed
on all the terms.

56:27.400 --> 56:30.153
Why should the signing of these articles
be suddenly held up?

56:30.240 --> 56:33.755
I'll admit that we were at one time
anxious for this merger.

56:33.840 --> 56:37.116
But since then, the Preysing Company
has fallen on evil days.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.236
- Evil days?
- Very evil days.

56:39.320 --> 56:40.753
Say, listen.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.876
Haven't I just shown you here...

56:42.960 --> 56:45.554
what my firm exports to the Balkans?

56:45.640 --> 56:49.997
50,000 marks worth of mop rags
each and every year.

56:50.080 --> 56:52.036
Mop rags.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.315
We're interested
in something entirely different.

56:54.400 --> 56:55.958
- What?
- Shall I tell them again?

56:56.040 --> 56:57.758
Why waste time? It's getting late.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.876
- You see...
- We're going home.

57:01.240 --> 57:04.232
But Mr. Preysing has too great a regard
for the certainty...

57:04.320 --> 57:07.437
You've been talking all day.
You're hoarse now.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.238
Good night, Preysing.

57:09.320 --> 57:12.278
You have decided against the merger?

57:12.360 --> 57:15.477
- Yes.
- The deal is off?

57:15.560 --> 57:16.675
Yes.

57:16.840 --> 57:19.559
- Here's your coat, sir.
- Thank you.

57:25.520 --> 57:27.875
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

57:31.920 --> 57:34.229
Preysing, I hope you pull through.

57:34.320 --> 57:37.676
It's a very bad time
to be in such a crisis. Sorry.

57:38.400 --> 57:41.517
- Dining in town?
- No, I have to get my train.

57:43.520 --> 57:47.195
Here! So you're breaking off
the negotiations.

57:47.480 --> 57:48.708
All right.

57:48.920 --> 57:51.718
But don't you think for one moment
that I'm such a fool...

57:51.800 --> 57:55.110
as not to have something
to say about Manchester.

57:55.920 --> 57:57.797
What? Manchester?

57:57.880 --> 58:00.792
No. The deal is over.
Good night, gentlemen.

58:00.880 --> 58:05.032
If you have something definite
to say about Manchester, we might...

58:05.200 --> 58:09.318
I'm at liberty to announce at this time
that the deal between my firm...

58:09.400 --> 58:11.311
and the Manchester Cotton Company...

58:11.400 --> 58:13.994
has been successfully negotiated.

58:15.400 --> 58:19.075
Are you joking?
Under those circumstances...

58:19.160 --> 58:21.674
- Where are those articles?
- I thought it was all over.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.910
Under these circumstances,
it's a different matter.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.595
Yes, but under these circumstances
we might refuse to sign now.

58:27.720 --> 58:31.030
Now, come, come.
Business is business. Now, I'll sign in here.

58:31.720 --> 58:34.553
Preysing, you sign here.

58:34.960 --> 58:37.520
We should celebrate this
with a bottle of wine.

58:37.600 --> 58:40.478
Good night. We'll see you next week
and settle all the details.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.198
- Next week. Yes.
- Come on.

58:42.560 --> 58:45.472
Good night, Preysing. You're a sly one.

58:46.760 --> 58:48.239
- Dr. Waitz?
- Yes.

58:48.840 --> 58:51.718
I'll be at your office tomorrow.

58:57.680 --> 58:59.352
You let me talk myself hoarse...

58:59.440 --> 59:02.159
and you had Manchester
signed up all the time. Why?

59:04.520 --> 59:06.829
- The deal has been put through.
- Yeah.

59:06.920 --> 59:10.310
The deal has been put through.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.269
- What's the matter with you?
- Here.

59:17.520 --> 59:20.557
"Deal with Manchester definitely...

59:20.680 --> 59:22.955
"definitely off." Preysing!

59:23.040 --> 59:25.838
Yes, if that's what the world wants, bluff...

59:26.280 --> 59:28.191
I can be just as big a bluff as anyone.

59:28.280 --> 59:31.477
You must go to England yourself at once
and really see this through!

59:31.560 --> 59:33.710
Yes, I must go to England.
I was desperate.

59:33.800 --> 59:36.951
I didn't know what I was doing.
Now I don't care.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.873
This thing goes to a man's head.

59:42.480 --> 59:45.313
- What you need is some relaxation.
- Yeah!

59:45.520 --> 59:48.557
That's it! I want to break loose.

59:48.640 --> 59:52.235
I want to drink.
I want to maybe go dancing.

59:52.320 --> 59:53.548
I want to do anything.

59:53.640 --> 59:55.596
I can understand that, after this...

59:55.680 --> 59:58.478
Yes, go on, say it. My lie.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.836
But that's the first time in 30 years that...

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.039
Where is my stenographer? Miss Flaemm?

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.111
- What do you want with her?
- Pardon?

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.634
- What do you want?
- What?

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.040
Here. I want to do some dictating.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.270
I want to tell my father-in-law about...

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.669
She had an engagement
in the Yellow Room at 5:00.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.079
She was in a hurry.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.798
- In the Yellow Room?
- Yes.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.196
Do you think that she's pretty?

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.599
- Pretty as a picture.
- You think so?

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.875
Let's go find her. We'll go get a drink.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.076
- You come along, Zinnowitz.
- Yes.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.991
I don't know much about women.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.709
I've been married for 28 years, you know.
Come along, Zinnowitz.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.552
- Good evening, Mr. Kringelein.
- Good evening, Miss Flaemm.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.995
- Have you seen the Baron?
- I'm waiting for him.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.913
I've been with him all day.
We had a marvelous time.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.834
We were in a motor car,
100 miles an hour, in an airplane.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.990
- Really?
- We had a marvelous time.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.114
My, how you've changed.
You look awfully nice.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.078
Thank you, Miss Flaemm.
I had a manicure, too.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.434
Really?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.312
I'm sorry, Miss Flaemm.
Would you have something to drink?

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.995
A Louisiana Flip. Louisiana Flip, please.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.594
- Absinthe.
- Oh, that.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.555
- You like music, Mr. Kringelein?
- Yes. I love it.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.437
It's so stimulating.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.476
- A man could...
- A man could what?

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.190
- He could do almost anything.
- He could.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.111
- Hello, funny one.
- Hello.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.953
- Sorry I'm late.
- Baron, won't you have a drink?

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.636
- A Louisiana Flip.
- Mr. Kringelein, how are you now?

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.870
I feel a little strange, Baron.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.155
- I'd given you up.
- Sorry.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.710
Please, Baron, do have a drink.
A Louisiana Flip.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.236
No, thanks, old man.
I'm keeping my head clear.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.793
- Dance, then?
- What?

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.348
- Dance?
- Yes, I'd love to.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.997
- Watch this, will you, Mr. Kringelein?
- I really ought to learn to dance.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.398
I suppose it's very important.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.472
Yes, you should learn
as quickly as the time allows.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.276
Believe me, Mr. Kringelein,
a man who is not with a woman...

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.914
is a dead man.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.356
- What have you been doing all day?
- Chasing around.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.400
- Chasing what?
- Money.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.993
- You were very different yesterday.
- That was yesterday.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.113
I served as a surgeon in the Great War...

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.313
till the end.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.991
Grenade in my face.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.517
I carried diphtheria bacilli
in the wound till 1920.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.995
Isolated two years.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.068
- Drink, Mr. Kringelein.
- Yes.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.799
That was lovely.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.317
Listen, funny one,
do you want to make a man happy?

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.874
- I'd love to.
- Dance with old Kringelein.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.673
Why?

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.318
I don't know. He's a dear old duck.
I feel rather sorry for him, don't you?

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.750
You know, you're not a bit
like you were yesterday.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.634
Yesterday?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.997
No, perhaps not.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.916
I fell in love last night.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.999
The real thing.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.989
There's no real thing. It just doesn't exist.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.509
I thought that, too.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.870
But now I know that it does.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.752
It's wonderful.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.313
Come along.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.710
- Dance with old Kringelein?
- Of course. Anything for you.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.630
You're sweet.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.270
Here you are. I must speak with you.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.796
- Presently, Mr. Preysing.
- No, now. This is very urgent.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.111
This lady has urgent business with me
at the moment.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.309
Insolence. Berlin manners.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.110
Good evening, Mr. Preysing.
You're staying here, too?

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.193
- I'm sorry, but I cannot place you.
- Kringelein, at the plant.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.793
One of our agents.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.590
No. Assistant bookkeeper,
Room 23, Building C, third floor.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.436
- I am away, sick.
- That's very interesting.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.108
Good day.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.949
Would you like to dance with me,
Mr. Kringelein?

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.270
Miss Flaemm, I've never danced in public.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.272
- Come along and try it.
- I'd be afraid.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.954
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You'll love it.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.035
Miss Flaemmchen, I must speak to you.
This is about a dictating job.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.237
- When do we start? Tomorrow morning?
- No, right now.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.390
We were just going to dance.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.278
Do you know each other?
Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.833
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend
and not accept your invitation to dance.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.871
I couldn't think of not accepting
the invitation to dance.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.950
I understood you to say
that you reported to our plant ill...

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.952
and you're here in Berlin
indulging in diversions...

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.190
which are very much beyond your means?

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.199
This is very extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.111
I think we should look over your books.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.158
Come along now, children. No fighting.
Save that for the office.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.435
Does the world belong to you,
Mr. Preysing?

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.158
Haven't I got any right to live?

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.912
I will wait 10 minutes for you.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.151
If you're not back, it will be necessary
to engage someone else.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.071
What happened to your dance?

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.628
We're going now, thank you, Baron.
Come along.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.908
I shall remember this, Mr. Kringelein.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.197
Let the poor devil alone.
Death's staring him in the face.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.510
I did not ask your advice.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.470
I think you'd better go away.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.949
We will see
who will remain here the longer.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.076
Baron von Geigern, please.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.513
Mr. Kringelein, you must look at my face,
and not the floor.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.669
Yes.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:41.038
- Why, you're trembling.
- I never danced in public before.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.834
- You dance beautifully.
- Thank you.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.913
- That's right.
- I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.831
Are you really?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.719
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.993
Are you all right?

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.152
Yes. Excuse me, I just stopped a second.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.071
All right. Here we go.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.398
I'm very tired. Do you mind if we stop?

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.913
Thank you.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.915
- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now.
- Must you?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.753
Yes, business.
One has to earn a living, you know.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.592
Not you, Miss Flaemm.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.148
Just another desk slave. Money.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.270
- I'm glad you're here, Miss Flaemm.
- Here I am.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.351
- Did you enjoy your dance?
- Yes, thank you.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.193
- Excuse me. Go away, please.
- Where's the Louisiana Flip?

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.158
- Would you like a little cognac?
- Yes. You wanted to see me?

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.357
Yes. You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.149
Mr. Preysing, I am not taking orders
from you here.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.151
What is this insolence? Please go away.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.198
You think you have free license
to be insulting?

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.032
Believe me, you have not.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.750
You think you're superior,
but you're quite an ordinary man...

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.398
even if you did marry money...

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.710
and people like me
have got to slave for you...

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.438
for 320 marks a month.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.036
- Go away, please. You are annoying.
- You don't like to see me enjoying myself.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.556
When a man's working himself to death,
that's what he's paid for.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.473
You don't care if a man
can live on his wages or not.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.599
You have a very regular scale of wages,
and there's the sick fund for you.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.399
What a scale, and what a fund.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.357
When I was sick for four weeks...

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.749
you wrote me a letter
telling me I'd be discharged...

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.636
if I were sick any longer.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.517
Did you write me that letter or not?

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.478
I have no idea of the letters that I write.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.551
I know that you are here
in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.154
You are probably an embezzler.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.151
- An embezzler!
- Yes, an embezzler.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.515
You are going to take that back!

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.955
Right here in the presence
of this young lady!

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.917
Who do you think you're talking to?
You think I'm dirt?

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.712
If I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier...

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.394
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing!

01:08:51.479 --> 01:08:54.118
- You're discharged. Get out!
- You can't do that to him.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.033
I don't know the man or what he wants.
I never saw him before.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.348
I know you.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:01.033
I've kept your books for you,
and I know all about you.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.078
If one of your employees
was half as stupid in a small way...

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.879
- as you are in a big way...
- What do you mean?

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.474
Gentlemen, please! Please!

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.959
Stop that!

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.229
- You're discharged! Do you hear?
- Wait!

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.238
You can't discharge me.
I'm my own master...

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.675
for the first time in my life.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.630
You can't discharge me. I'm sick.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.792
I'm going to die. You understand?

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.312
I'm going to die, and nobody
can do anything to me anymore.

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:41.073
Nothing can happen to me anymore.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:46.109
Before I can be discharged, I'll be dead!

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.037
The man's crazy.
I don't know him. He's annoying.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.435
- Baron!
- Excuse me.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.348
- What is it? What's happened to him?
- He's ill.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:03.150
- I'm sorry, Baron.
- Poor old Kringelein. You're all right.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.073
- Give him some whiskey.
- No.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.189
A Louisiana Flip.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.559
Five minutes to 7:00.
Time drags when you're tired.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.994
I was in the hospital the whole night,
walking up and down the corridor.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.436
They wouldn't let me see her.
And I have to stay chained to this desk.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.636
Did you find that young lady
for Mr. Preysing?

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.280
- His secretary. Yes, they're over there.
- That's all.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.789
His secretary.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.470
Come on, waiter.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.948
- Would you like a little cognac?
- No, nothing.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:44.950
Nothing?

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.315
- One cognac for me.
- Very good, sir.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.671
You wanted to see me?

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.115
Yes. Pardon me. I must go to England.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.510
It's very important. I must go at once.
I have some very big deals...

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.398
involving hundreds of thousands
of marks...

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.793
and I thought
I would take along a secretary...

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.269
to take care of my correspondence.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.998
You know what I mean.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.072
I understood you to say
that you traveled and...

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.638
You understand?

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.869
I understand you perfectly, Mr. Preysing.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.878
What would you want for such a trip?

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.554
- Marks? You mean money?
- Yes.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.476
I don't know. I'd have to figure it up.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.869
I'd need clothes and shoes...

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.719
and it's cold in England in March.
And I'd need a suit.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.270
- You'd want me to look nice?
- Of course, Miss Flaemm.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.669
Yes, I thought you would.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.197
I should say 1,000 marks.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.279
- Is that too much?
- No.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.392
That is all right.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.076
Would you like me
to get you a room here...

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.350
at the hotel? Now?

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.510
- And that would...
- Hello, Baron.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.876
- Would you please pay some attention?
- I'm paying attention.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.994
- How do you do?
- Insolence.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.354
You mean the Baron?

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.876
- Baron what?
- What?

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.072
He's a gentleman.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.510
Is the Baron tired?

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.358
No, not tired exactly.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.318
I thought this evening
we could go to the casino.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.551
That place we passed
with the wonderful bright lights.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.990
Kringelein, I'd adore it.
I can't go anywhere.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.156
- What?
- I'm broke.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.910
- No, you're joking.
- Yes. Isn't it odd?

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.996
A baron, broke.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.758
Excuse me, old man.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.673
- I quit.
- You can't.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.751
I'm not getting those pearls,
neither are you.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.637
- What about the money?
- I'll pay you back.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.518
- How?
- I have an idea working in my head.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.750
You might find a bullet through that head.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.310
If you do that you'll get nothing,
except maybe the police after you.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.794
Mme. Grusinskaya's car!

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.873
If you wait, I'll pay you back your 5,000...

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.432
I'll see you later.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.633
Go on, Suzette.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.788
Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight. How I shall dance!

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.836
I want to feel that you're there.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.991
I came too far.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.118
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't be.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.758
- You'll be on the train?
- Yes.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.831
- Until then.
- Bless you.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.913
- Was the Baron joking?
- What?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.629
- Is it really true?
- What are you talking about, Kringelein?

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.792
Is the Baron really in financial straits?

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.514
To tell you the truth, I must get
some money somehow right away.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.831
- If the Baron will permit me.
- What?

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:43.119
I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.315
Three hundred?

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.869
If I could get into a game of some kind,
I think I might win.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.834
Gambling! I'd love that!

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.390
I've got over 6,800 marks right here.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.436
If we could scare up some men to play.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.751
- We could go up to my room.
- That's a grand idea.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.195
Come on.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.512
- Cab, miss?
- What?

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.592
- Cab?
- No, thanks. I'll walk.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.156
- 4,000 marks.
- 4,000!

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.150
Too high?

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.113
4,000 marks.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.838
- Want a card?
- Please.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.114
Thanks.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.480
- 8,000 marks.
- 8,000!

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.269
- I take it all.
- That's a lot of money.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.272
I need it, thanks.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.632
- Want a card?
- Please.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.353
Baccarat.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.668
Too bad there.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.593
- Now, Mr. Kringelein.
- Baron!

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.756
Will you help me again, please?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.035
I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.317
- Make your bets, gentlemen.
- How much shall I bet?

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.678
- How much is left in the bank?
- 2,500 uncovered.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.553
- Do you feel like going that far?
- All that money, Baron?

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.189
Come on, you're killing them tonight.
Go ahead, old man.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.349
Do you want a card?

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.919
What have you got?

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.030
The old highwayman. He has nine again.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.555
I win again!

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.112
Come on, gentlemen. Please drink! Drink.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.470
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.348
Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.989
Yes! Surely. I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.993
Come on, now. Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.911
It's expensive and good.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.156
What will I take the bank for?

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.073
- I'll play for 500.
- Baron, all at once?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.434
Suppose you lose it?

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.398
It's all the same thing, Kringelein.
Come on, now, old man.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.909
Deal me two cards.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.878
One to me first. One to yourself.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.037
One to me. One to yourself.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.349
Baron, if all that money...

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.751
What have you got?

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.594
I've got a nine!

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.238
Isn't that a wonderful thing?

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.154
Kringelein, you old robber,
you're hopeless.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.911
Baron! Baron, please.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.080
It's no use, old man. It's sweet of you...

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.674
- but you have all the luck.
- It's true.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.673
I have luck, for the first time in my life!
I have luck!

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:59.116
Baron, are you out?
Have you finished playing?

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.599
Yes, thank you.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.719
I'll recover again presently,
in 10 or 20 years.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.917
Look, Doctor. I've won again!

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.353
There you are.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.194
Baron, I win and drink, and drink and win!

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.873
Gentlemen, please don't go.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.077
Be my guests. Don't go. I beg your pardon.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.551
I know I oughtn't to presume,
but I'm so grateful to you.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.278
It's been so marvelous.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.956
For the first time in my life,
I've gambled and I've danced.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.792
You gentlemen can laugh...

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.668
but for the first time in my life,
I've tasted life!

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:41.673
- Splendid!
- Life is wonderful, but it's very dangerous.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.752
If you have the courage to live it,
it's marvelous.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.749
- Wonderful!
- You don't know about that.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.469
You're healthy and happy.
But I, believe me...

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.599
if a man doesn't know death,
he doesn't know life.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.958
- It's a short life, but a gay one.
- Please, gentlemen, don't go.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.679
Come on. Drink to life...

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.317
to the magnificent, dangerous...

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.233
brief, wonderful life.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.959
- Kringelein!
- And the courage to live it.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.952
You know, I've only lived since last night...

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.070
but that little while seems longer
than all the time that's gone before.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.914
All of...

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.151
Take him over to his bed.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.798
Turn him around.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.592
How is he, Doctor?

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.110
- It will be over in a minute.
- Over?

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.431
- It's only just begun.
- Quiet, Kringelein. Don't be afraid.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.715
I'm not afraid, Doc.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.833
- I'm not afraid to die.
- There, there.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:50.151
You'll be all right.
Too much iced champagne.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.157
- What?
- Hello, Baron.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.673
Hello, Kringelein.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.911
You old drunkard.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.918
It's late.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.757
- What is it?
- My pocketbook.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.191
I've lost my pocketbook.
14,000 marks in that pocketbook.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.839
- I've got to find it.
- No, stay where you are.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.512
No, I've got to find that.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.955
- Kringelein!
- 14,000 marks.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:46.399
14,000 marks were in that pocketbook.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.915
I can't see anything.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.959
You don't know what that money means
to a man like me.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.635
You've never lived like a dog in a hole...

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.752
and scrimped and saved.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.111
You did not see his pocketbook,
did you, Baron?

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.349
No.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.073
My life hangs on that money, Baron.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.273
Nobody ever gives you anything
for nothing.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.750
You have to buy everything,
and pay cash for it.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:19.630
I wanted to pay for my last days
with that money.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.831
I must find it!

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.230
I haven't anything in the world
but that pocketbook!

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.030
Every hour costs money. I must find it!

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.478
Here's your pocketbook,
you silly old thing.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.318
- There's your money.
- You found it!

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.233
That's it. You found it.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.279
I'm very glad he got it back. 14,000 marks.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.555
Yes. It's a lot of money, isn't it?

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.275
- Good night, Kringelein.
- Don't go, Baron. Don't leave me.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.275
- I must, old man. It's late, I'm sorry.
- No. Please don't go!

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.319
I must, old man. It's late.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.634
Good night.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.638
Good night, Kringelein.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.996
Stay a while, Baron.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.715
I'm sorry. I can't, old man.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.958
I have no time.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.359
Wait a minute.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.196
- Hello, funny one.
- Hello.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.471
What are you doing here at this time?

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.790
Looking for my room. 164.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.952
- Do you live here?
- Yes, for tonight.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.038
Such is life, Flaemmchen.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.399
You're nice.

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.993
Good night...

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.359
funny one.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.039
Good night.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.274
Come on.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.834
- Thank you, madam. Good night.
- Good night.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.117
You were superb tonight. What a success!

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.997
Yes. It was a triumph, wasn't it?

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.071
Madame will return to Berlin soon?

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.197
Who knows, <i>monsieur</i> ?

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.513
Do be sensible.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.910
Shall I come and talk
about the music now, or not?

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.230
No. Not tonight.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.910
Pimenov, go and find him.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.268
- Flaemmchen.
- Hello.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.669
I've been waiting in there for you.

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.474
I had to arrange about the trip.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.357
- You're very sweet.
- Thank you.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.112
Won't you sit down?

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:39.234
You know, you are entirely different
from what I expected.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:42.917
- Different? How?
- I don't know.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.516
I thought you were more of a coquette...

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.751
not so ladylike.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.198
What did you expect?

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.837
Wouldn't you like to call me
by the first name?

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.830
No, I couldn't do that.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.839
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.394
One can't get intimate just offhand.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.433
I could go to England with you
and all that, but...

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.750
I always say that nothing
should be left hanging over.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.637
And names are like that.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.709
Supposing I met you next year and I said:

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.791
"How do you do, Mr. Preysing."

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:25.395
And you said, "That's the young lady
who was my secretary in Manchester."

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.311
That's all quite proper.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.831
But supposing I saw you and yelled:

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.036
"Hi, baby! Remember Manchester?"

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:37.917
And you were with your wife.
How would you like that?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.992
We will leave my wife out of this,
Flaemmchen, please.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:45.350
- Sorry.
- I didn't mean that.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.752
You are very slender, aren't you?

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.479
- Think so?
- Are you going to be nice to me?

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.109
Yes.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.678
- Very nice?
- That's what you expect, isn't it?

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.791
You like me just a little bit, don't you?

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.591
You're still a stranger to me,
but that doesn't matter.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.594
It's you, Baron.
What are you doing in this room here?

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.673
- This your room, Preysing?
- Yes, this is my room.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.398
Sorry. I must've made a mistake.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.074
We shall see whether you made
a mistake or not.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.631
That door is locked, Baron.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.438
Yes. I came through here.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.988
Here. I want that pocketbook.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.035
- What do you mean?
- I want that pocketbook. Give it to me!

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.112
- Certainly.
- So that's how we stand, Baron.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.474
Look here, Preysing...

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.269
I'm completely at your mercy.
I was desperate.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.158
It's a matter of life and death.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.356
I had to get some money tonight,
somehow.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.795
Yes, you did have to get
some money tonight...

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.440
but you're going to jail.
You're going to be locked up.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.080
- Why, you're a thief!
- Be quiet.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.316
Quiet? Yeah, quiet!

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.393
You danced with Flaemmchen when
I wanted to transact business with her.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.916
You, the nice friend
of the nice Mr. Kringelein.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.754
- Do you want to wake up the entire hotel?
- I will wake up the hotel!

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.151
I'll show them what a baron you are.
You are a thief!

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.073
I'll have you locked up.
Here, you wait here.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.069
Thief! You!

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.789
Strike me, would you?

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.952
Hello. Operator. Operator.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.430
They're having a nice little game up there
with that telephone.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.594
Oh, God.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.958
Baron! Speak to me!

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.514
Baron.

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.552
He tried to rob me. He's a thief.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.112
Here, Miss Flaemm.

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.557
Miss Flaemm, please don't leave me.
Please, Miss Flaemm.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.390
- Look!
- What a grand hotel!

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.233
- Hurry up. They're waiting.
- She was in a hurry.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.117
No wonder she was running.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.428
Mr. Kringelein!

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.709
Wake up!

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.871
Hear me? Wake up!

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.076
- The Baron.
- The Baron?

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.436
Go quickly. The Baron. Do you hear me?

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.190
- Where?
- Preysing's room.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.873
Hurry!

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.068
Here. Take it. You thief, you.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.273
I must get out of here.

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:48.478
Mr. Kringelein, he robbed me.
He struck me. He's dead.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:56.315
Baron. Dead, just like that.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.037
Look. His eyes are still open.

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.716
He looks so peaceful.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:06.075
It can't be so hard to die.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.273
That pocketbook he stole from me.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.591
It's just like it was.
I haven't touched nothing.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.833
Maybe he did try to take
your pocketbook...

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.911
but you don't kill a man for that.

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.469
You don't kill a man about a pocketbook.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.438
Poor Baron, he wanted money so badly.

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:35.832
- Where is Miss Flaemm?
- I'll take care of her.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.992
That's it. She's working with that man.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:44.158
She enticed me into her room
while he robbed me here.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:47.038
- I'll tell that to the court.
- To the court?

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.030
Yes.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.713
Mr. Kringelein, I must talk with you
before the police come.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.351
Miss Flaemm is in your room?

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:58.432
- Yes.
- She's in your room.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.432
No one will know that I was with her.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.352
You were with her.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:07.471
They will not interrogate you.
They will not ask you any questions.

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:11.235
You cannot give no testimony.
Neither can she say anything.

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:15.750
But what you are proposing
is falsification of the evidence.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.593
My existence is hanging by a thread.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:21.439
A scandal with that woman
would mean ruin for me.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.718
- But you've just killed a man!
- That makes no difference!

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.918
I beg your pardon.
It makes all the difference in the world.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.919
- We're going to call the police.
- No!

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.479
Please, Mr. Kringelein.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.757
I will give you money, anything.
You can go away. Please.

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:42.391
- I have enough money.
- Mr. Kringelein, please help me.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.479
- My life is in your hands.
- Your life.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.277
What about my life,
when you had it in your hands?

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.749
But I can send you back to Friedersdorf.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.673
I can give you a very good position
in Friedersdorf.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:59.992
Many, many thanks,
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing...

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.113
- but I am never going back to Friedersdorf.
- Don't, please.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.033
Worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.111
No, Mr. Kringelein, please don't call...

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.634
Hello! There's been a murder here.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.915
I don't understand you. Murder?

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.991
- They're drinking.
- What?

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.878
Yes. What is it? Is this a joke?

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.913
Hello. Hurry up.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.991
Someone in 166
says there's been a murder.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.117
166? Preysing?

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.113
I'll attend to it.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:45.909
- What time is it, Suzette?
- It's 3:00 in the morning, Madame.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.275
Tired, Suzette?

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.828
- Is Madame not tired?
- No, Suzette.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:55.674
- Madame has changed her dress again.
- Yes, Suzette.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.276
The music has stopped.

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.797
How quiet it is tonight.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.193
It was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.869
Those flowers make me think of funerals.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.191
- Don't they you, Suzette?
- It's just nerves, Madame, nerves.

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.399
Suzette, we're going to
take a holiday soon.

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.959
Six weeks in Tremezzo.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.076
I'm going to live like a real woman...

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:39.152
perfectly simple, perfectly quiet,
perfectly happy.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.993
- Yes, Madame.
- We'll have a guest.

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.229
Certainly, Madame.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.312
But Madame must sleep now.
The train will soon go.

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.639
I suppose so.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.634
Call Baron von Geigern's room, please.

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.709
Keep ringing. He must be asleep.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.679
Come and fetch me, <i>chéri</i>...

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.918
I'm longing for you.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.871
I haven't been asleep.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.194
I kept thinking that you might come to me.

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.716
But he must answer. Ring!

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.112
Why don't you answer the phone, please?

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.554
Yes.

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.872
Yes. Ring.

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.949
Where are you?

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.875
Thirty-four!

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.874
Thirty-six.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.594
Thirty-eight.

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.433
Forty.

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.637
- Forty-two.
- Let's go to work, boys.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.313
Forty-four.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:46.871
Forty-four, forty-six pounds.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.235
Forty-eight.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.549
- Are these things necessary?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Preysing.

01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.233
All right.

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.274
We've taken care of all that, Mr. Preysing.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.751
The night porter's gone. You're late.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:31.274
I was at the clinic the whole night.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.033
- My wife, poor girl.
- The child hasn't come yet?

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.396
No. But I mustn't let it interfere
with my duty.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.159
- You won't forget that?
- No, sir.

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.878
- I'm going now.
- Yes, Doctor.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.554
- What's this?
- A killing in 166.

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:44.629
Killing? Who?

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.439
The big manufacturer Preysing
killed Baron von Geigern.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.078
Good heavens! What for?

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.197
- I don't know.
- That's terrible!

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.594
- He was a nice fellow.
- They say he was a thief.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.069
I don't believe it. He was a real gentleman.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.112
I know people.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.353
I'm so tired
I can't hardly see out of my eyes.

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.796
No sleep for two nights, here all day,
and now this killing at the hotel.

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.279
Halt! Front!

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.676
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.320
Show your hands. Hands. Over.

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.191
- Change those gloves.
- Yes, sir.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.270
- Down.
- Dismissed.

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.272
Too bad about the Baron.

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.430
You always felt better
when he came along.

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.672
- Always friendly, such an agreeable fellow.
- I'll tell you a funny thing about...

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.796
Be quiet. Good morning, madam.

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.993
Where are you taking that dog?

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.116
- Baron von Geigern.
- Give it to me.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.753
Better take charge of this dog.
It belonged to the Baron.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.068
Yes, sir.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.637
- They have taken him away?
- Yes. Wasn't it terrible?

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.315
Madame must not know. You understand?
Madame must not know!

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.439
All right, I can tell it to the maids,
but I can't answer for downstairs.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.830
- Are you all right, Miss Flaemmchen?
- Yes.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.430
I was just thinking about the Baron.

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:44.436
Lying there, with his eyes so open.

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.790
You loved the Baron, didn't you?

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.273
So did I.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.994
He was friendly to me as no man ever was.

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.678
What if he was a burglar?

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.070
- They don't kill a man for that.
- He was desperate.

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.235
He was?

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:12.277
He tried to raise money all day.

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.193
And he laughed, poor devil.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.037
And a man like Preysing has to kill him.

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.429
You know, I didn't like Preysing right off.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.949
Why did you have anything
to do with him?

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.635
- Money.
- Money.

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.632
- You don't understand that, do you?
- Yes, I do.

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.956
- Do you really?
- Yes, I do.

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.399
I could take care of you,
Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.232
I have enough money.

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:48.869
There's 10,200 marks in this pocketbook...

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.873
and there's 3,400 that I won last night.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.872
That would last a long time.
I could win some more. We could travel.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.951
- Travel?
- Yes, to Paris.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.669
- I've always wanted to go to Paris.
- Anywhere you like. Here.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:08.231
I'll give you this money
I won last night. 3,400...

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.596
- and then later you can have some more.
- Later?

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:14.240
Yes, when I...

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.676
I'm ill, Flaemmchen.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:19.320
I won't live long. Will you stay with me?

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.598
That's nonsense!
We'll find a great doctor. He'll cure you.

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.240
- They can cure anything these days.
- You think so?

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.039
Of course. You'll see. Here.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.959
Do you think you'd have
as good a time with me...

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.473
as you did with Preysing?

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.869
- Why, of course.
- Really?

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:42.517
- Yes.
- You like me better than you did him?

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:50.318
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein.
A very good man.

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.790
You know, I never thought
anything so beautiful could come to me.

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.999
We'll catch the first train to Paris.
Order two tickets now. Come on.

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.439
I can't.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:17.679
Hello, porter?

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.269
Yes, please.

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.790
I'd like two tickets to Paris.

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.395
Yes.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.397
What time does the next train leave?

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.994
Pimenov.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.433
- He'll be on the train.
- But how do you know?

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.349
Baron von Geigern has left?
When? How long ago?

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.795
The Baron left about half an hour ago.

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:43.474
Gru, come, come. We'll lose the train.

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.552
Come along.

01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.912
Here you are, sir.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.398
I'm sorry.

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.037
Mme. Grusinskaya's car.

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.716
Come along, the train will be going.

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.948
- What is it, Gru?
- Please come, madam, please.

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:26.600
- I'll ask myself.
- What is the use of asking?

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:30.275
- He'll be on the train. He'll be there.
- Have you seen Baron von Geigern?

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.191
The Baron is not here, madam.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.874
