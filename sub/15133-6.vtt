00:04.538 --> 00:06.369
<i>When you love
someone...</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:09.034
The Fringe? In two weeks?
That's completely insane.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.038
I usually don't like
a lot of people.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.512
Just don't let
me down, okay?

00:13.981 --> 00:16.006
Ladies and gentlemen,
Terry Falls.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.051
Ah, yes. Young Cecile.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.450
How you have grown.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.215
He's playing
the whole thing like
it's a comedy.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.755
I've decided
to go off my meds.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.588
Thanks for the files.
Eileen will never
work without me again.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.821
Have you got a brilliant
book for the read-through
this afternoon?

00:28.896 --> 00:31.421
I'm not going to produce it.
I have a version that I love.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.091
How did you get this?
He sent it to me.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.192
It was just the draft
I liked the most.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.794
We need a tie-breaker.
Since it's up to me...

00:41.976 --> 00:45.537
<i>Here she is,
Miss Marilyn Monroe</i>

00:45.946 --> 00:49.438
<i>Will she have the answers
that our readers want to know?</i>

00:49.517 --> 00:51.417
<i>From India
And Paris</i>

00:51.485 --> 00:53.248
<i>And from just
across the pond</i>

00:53.788 --> 00:59.886
<i>We have so many questions for
America's smart, dumb blonde</i>

00:59.960 --> 01:01.951
Okay, you lot,
go up stage left.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.621
You lot, go up
stage right.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.556
Because, oh,
look out,

01:05.633 --> 01:09.399
here comes the enormous,
expensive and totally
unnecessary plane

01:09.470 --> 01:11.734
that's about to
land on the stage.

01:11.806 --> 01:16.106
And the steps roll in,
and Karen walks down...

01:16.544 --> 01:18.034
It's gonna be great.
Spectacular.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.103
It's for tourists.
It isn't art.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.114
I completely disagree.

01:22.416 --> 01:26.682
It's a dynamic,
Technicolor fantasy of
the way Marilyn made herself.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.487
And it's going
to fit perfectly
in our new book.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.355
Your new book.
As opposed to
mine and Julia's,

01:32.426 --> 01:34.360
which I was
really looking
forward to directing.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.554
Best thing
I've ever written.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.356
We said we'd go with
whatever Eileen chose.

01:37.431 --> 01:41.492
Well, clearly I only said that
because I thought she would
make the right choice.

01:41.836 --> 01:44.236
And I did.
And I agree.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.297
Though we might
have to cut something
to make room for this number.

01:48.876 --> 01:49.934
There's a lot of music.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.881
Is this a theater
or a bar?

01:58.953 --> 02:01.012
I knew the last slot
meant the crappiest space.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.454
It's the Fringe.
You get two days
and a shoebox.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.823
Sometimes
it's a disaster.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.758
But sometimes
you break out.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.762
I like it.

02:10.097 --> 02:13.157
It's not too fancy,
which is good for us.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.562
It's got good acoustics,
'cause it's small.
And who cares anyway.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.071
The show's good.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.104
It better be.
We're on in 10 hours.

Hey!

03:26.574 --> 03:29.065
Um, there's a performance
going on upstairs.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.008
So could you guys,
like, shut up?

03:31.078 --> 03:32.136
Sorry.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.237
Oops.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.070
My bad.

03:35.149 --> 03:38.550
Hey, does anybody
know what time it is? Oh.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.610
Ugh, damn.
I gotta go to rehearsal.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.918
Now? We haven't run
your numbers yet.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.184
We've been running
them all week.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.247
What about the new ones?

03:45.326 --> 03:48.193
Kyle, chill.
It's gonna be fine.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.697
Thank you.
Any time.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.401
I can't believe
she couldn't get
out for one night.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.439
Dude, it's Broadway.
It doesn't work like that.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.098
There's millions
of dollars at stake.

04:01.175 --> 04:03.075
You're not just like,
"Hmm, I feel like taking

04:03.143 --> 04:05.236
"the night off to do
a show in a basement."

04:05.713 --> 04:08.477
It is not just
a show in a basement.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.710
Real people are coming.
I just want it to be great.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.342
It will be.
Look, Karen's a pro.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.512
She knows her stuff.
She'll be ready.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.747
Oh, hold the door.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.916
Oh.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.964
Thanks.
No problem.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.101
<i>So, how's Bombshell?</i>

04:31.171 --> 04:32.365
It's great.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.770
Yeah. How's yours?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.406
So good.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.339
Terry Falls
is fantastic.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.938
Down-to-earth, smart, real.
The show is a dream.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.880
Cool.
See ya.

04:45.452 --> 04:49.479
Ivy, thank God you're here.
You won't believe
what he's done now.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.415
Have a good rehearsal.

04:54.161 --> 04:58.598
Ah, my darling Cecile!
Isn't it glorious?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.423
More of your vision?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.731
Ever since I went off
my meds, I feel amazing!

05:03.070 --> 05:06.369
I haven't slept in four days.
I've been accomplishing
so many things!

05:06.440 --> 05:10.399
I got certified in archery,
I've learned French,
I got arrested!

05:10.477 --> 05:12.843
Ugh, these aren't going to
be real sheep, are they?

05:12.913 --> 05:15.882
Ha! Of course they are.
Stuffed sheep can't act.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.680
I am worried about
the peacocks, though.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.777
They're notoriously
difficult to work with.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.290
That's much better.
Where is Bessie?

05:25.359 --> 05:27.725
It's not too late.
Tech doesn't start till
the day after tomorrow.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.784
Oh, there she is.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.329
Terry's the only reason
this revival is happening.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.194
We have to make it work.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.995
You can't have mirrors
onstage like that!

05:34.068 --> 05:35.467
They're gonna reflect
light into the audience.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.299
Oh, no.
Those aren't mirrors.
They're metaphors

05:37.371 --> 05:39.236
for vanity and
self-absorption.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.732
Oh, look.
There I am again!

05:42.509 --> 05:45.478
Who knows? Maybe it'll be
the comedy surprise
hit of the season.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.604
A satire?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.274
Satires are supposed to
be smart and sophisticated.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.784
Ivy! I'm going to make
love to you in these!

05:52.853 --> 05:55.185
In the show! In the show.

06:00.160 --> 06:05.097
<i>When he warned
of the cost and the heart
that he lost</i>

06:05.165 --> 06:09.431
<i>Mr. Yeats really paved the way</i>

06:09.503 --> 06:14.964
<i>For the men that I've known
who have clearly shown</i>

06:15.542 --> 06:20.070
<i>They've been reading him
from the start</i>

06:20.180 --> 06:23.013
<i>'Cause when it comes to me</i>

06:23.083 --> 06:24.380
You still love
this song, right?

06:24.485 --> 06:26.146
<i>Well, their kisses come free</i>

06:26.253 --> 06:27.550
Your lyrics
are brilliant.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.983
<i>But they never give
all the heart
Using that Yeats poem was...</i>

06:30.057 --> 06:31.149
You're overdoing it.
Right.

06:35.662 --> 06:38.688
<i>Very nice, Karen.
Okay, let's move on to Mambo.</i>

06:38.766 --> 06:39.926
I'd like a word.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.067
Or we could take a 10.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.494
That's the song.
The song?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.096
To cut.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.631
<i>For Public Relations.</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:50.700
You're kidding.
He's kidding, right?

06:50.778 --> 06:53.975
That song is one of
the most beautiful
ballads in the show.

06:54.047 --> 06:58.347
One of. There's too many.
It's unnecessary.

06:59.052 --> 07:03.819
Some girl on an empty stage
telling me a sad story?
Enough already.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.825
She's not just some girl.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.555
It's Marilyn, looking
back and realizing

07:08.629 --> 07:11.257
that she loved more
than she was loved!

07:11.765 --> 07:12.891
He means Karen.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.458
Our star?

07:15.269 --> 07:16.600
Not yet.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.004
And if we're not
going to have a star,
then we need...

07:20.073 --> 07:22.007
What, an airplane
on the bloody stage?
Yes.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.511
And with all that
going on around her,
we're golden. But this...

07:25.579 --> 07:27.706
Is the first song we wrote.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.511
It's what got us excited
about the project
in the first place.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.711
It's what got you
excited, Eileen.

07:32.853 --> 07:36.084
It's a lovely song, Julia.
No one's disputing that.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.056
But Jerry's right,
it stops the show.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.458
You just said "Jerry's right"
for the third time
in the last week.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.587
Has everyone lost
their mind?

07:44.465 --> 07:46.092
He's destroying the show!

07:46.533 --> 07:48.467
By the time he's finished,
it's going to be

07:48.535 --> 07:51.629
<i>Marilyn, The Radio City
Christmas Spectacular!</i>

07:51.939 --> 07:55.534
Can I just remind you that
what we're listening to in
there is a book you wrote?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.975
One you were proud of once.
I'm not anymore.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.637
I know it's not exactly
what you wanted.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.078
Or Derek.
Or Derek.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.639
But that doesn't mean
it won't be great.

08:03.717 --> 08:07.050
<i>Let me talk to Eileen,
figure out a way
to keep Heart in.</i>

08:07.120 --> 08:09.884
I'll beg. Grovel.
Blackmail if I have to...

08:09.957 --> 08:15.020
If I succeed, will you please
try to get more on board?
I miss you.

08:19.166 --> 08:23.000
Get me my song,
and then we'll talk.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.437
I know Broadway
doesn't pay its
actors very well,

08:29.510 --> 08:33.275
but did you really
have to moonlight
as a house painter?

08:33.947 --> 08:38.179
Oh. I was painting
pieces for our Fringe set.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.416
<i>It's Hit List's first
performance tonight.</i>

08:41.722 --> 08:43.690
You're still doing the Fringe?
Who's your director?

08:43.756 --> 08:47.693
No one. We're just
throwing the first
act up, like you said.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.293
What?

08:49.363 --> 08:51.729
I didn't think
you'd do it without me.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.289
You were never really
going to do it anyway.
I knew that.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.269
You just got us started.
You're a big
Broadway director.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.635
You can't go back
to Fringe.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.036
Can I take a quick call?

09:02.109 --> 09:03.599
Sure.
Okay.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.638
<i>We're in Time Out.
There's a blurb
and everything!</i>

09:07.347 --> 09:09.941
And a picture of you.
It's not that great, but...

09:10.017 --> 09:11.985
Hey! Don't listen
to him, it's hot!

09:12.052 --> 09:15.146
<i>Apparently a bunch of
theater people RSVP'd.
We sold out tonight.</i>

09:15.222 --> 09:17.315
Karen...
I have to call you back.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.415
What is this?

09:19.626 --> 09:21.355
My assistant
just showed me this.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.921
Is there a problem?

09:24.998 --> 09:28.559
<i>Bombshell's
entire marketing campaign</i>

09:28.635 --> 09:32.435
is centered around
introducing Karen Cartwright.

09:32.506 --> 09:37.944
It only works if we're
actually introducing
Karen Cartwright.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.774
But it isn't interfering
with rehearsals.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.644
And it's not going to either.
You can't do it.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.411
It's two days.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.346
I'm your producer.

09:46.520 --> 09:51.082
I have the right to approve
any other project you do
while you're in my show.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.217
That's in your contract.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.897
Look, if you want to go, go.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.460
But don't bother
coming back here.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.235
Derek, you know
I can't not go.

10:03.303 --> 10:07.205
You're opening on Broadway.
What's more important?

10:12.512 --> 10:15.481
Sorry, love. I guess
we're both stuck here.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.175
Whether we like it or not.

10:23.116 --> 10:28.175

But the show is in six hours.
And you're the lead!

10:49.680 --> 10:52.911
I had no idea
this would happen.
I feel terrible.

10:52.983 --> 10:54.382
Tell them "no."
You have to be here.

10:54.451 --> 10:57.818
I tried. Jerry Rand is not
the most understanding person.
And Derek...

10:57.888 --> 10:59.378
Ah, there's
the real reason.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.520
It's my career, Jimmy.
I want to be there
for you guys so badly...

11:02.593 --> 11:05.061
But your career's
more important than
your friends, got it.

11:05.129 --> 11:07.757
I'm still a part of the show.
I just can't be
in it right now.

11:07.831 --> 11:09.059
Yeah, we need to
find a replacement.

11:09.133 --> 11:10.395
There's no time for someone
to learn the songs...

11:10.467 --> 11:12.332
Whoever we get
can hold the music.
It's Fringe.

11:12.770 --> 11:14.397
I can help call some people.

11:14.471 --> 11:15.870
Don't bother.
You've done enough.

11:15.939 --> 11:17.497
Jimmy...
Thank you, though,

11:17.574 --> 11:19.940
for waiting till six hours
before to bail.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.137
It's really classy. Oh, and
thank your boyfriend, too.

11:22.212 --> 11:23.679
Boyfriend?
I'm sure he had
nothing to do with this.

11:23.747 --> 11:25.715
Don't we have enough
to deal with? Just go.

11:36.026 --> 11:37.618
You look like
you've just come
from a funeral.

11:37.695 --> 11:40.562
We have. For the death
of our careers.

11:40.631 --> 11:42.189
It can't be that bad.

11:42.299 --> 11:43.994
Tomorrow's press day,
and we're considering

11:44.068 --> 11:46.559
going to that really bad
sushi place on 50th

11:46.637 --> 11:48.628
and praying for
food poisoning.

11:49.039 --> 11:50.836
Do you wanna talk?

11:51.241 --> 11:52.265
Come on.

11:53.811 --> 11:55.836
You're in prime position.

11:56.046 --> 11:57.877
Everyone expects you
to be good in a good show.

11:57.948 --> 12:00.348
But if you're
good in a bad show,
you stand out.

12:00.451 --> 12:02.043
That is a
time-honored tradition.

12:03.020 --> 12:05.545
But how am I
supposed to be good
opposite a lunatic?

12:06.223 --> 12:07.554
You got a big number, right?

12:07.624 --> 12:08.852
Yeah, but I've
been underplaying it.

12:08.926 --> 12:11.087
We're all underplaying
since Terry's so big.

12:11.161 --> 12:13.061
Forget about Terry.

12:13.664 --> 12:17.191
Just block out the white
noise and do it the way
you know it should be done.

12:18.669 --> 12:20.899
<i>Like I'm not doing
on Bombshell.</i>

12:21.905 --> 12:23.065
It's isn't going very well?

12:23.140 --> 12:25.631
Yeah, Jerry's cutting
everything, Julia's sulking,

12:25.709 --> 12:27.040
Eileen's policing us.

12:27.111 --> 12:28.544
And I'm just sitting
in the middle wondering

12:28.612 --> 12:30.477
what I loved about
it in the first place.

12:30.948 --> 12:34.577
You loved Karen.
You "saw" her, remember?

12:34.651 --> 12:36.881
I saw her as Marilyn.

12:37.488 --> 12:40.924
You'll see her again.

12:44.194 --> 12:45.183
I got to go.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.764
Thanks for the advice.

12:48.832 --> 12:50.459
Only thank me if it works.

12:53.103 --> 12:55.901
Wow. That sounds
like an amazing day.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.706
I'm sorry to vent.
I just had to talk to someone.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.367
I'm glad that you trust me.

13:00.978 --> 13:02.639
I wouldn't go that far.

13:05.949 --> 13:07.473
<i>Maybe you should
leave Bombshell.</i>

13:08.485 --> 13:10.749
What?
You're sitting around
torturing yourself

13:10.821 --> 13:12.015
when they don't
need you anymore.

13:12.089 --> 13:13.852
They made that very clear
after the read-through.

13:13.924 --> 13:15.357
Come on, that's not true.

13:15.425 --> 13:18.485
You should see Tom
going out of his way
to make me feel better.

13:18.562 --> 13:22.089
Yeah. I like Tom,
but partners, they talk.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.997
They consider, compromise.

13:24.334 --> 13:26.734
They don't just make
choices unilaterally.

13:27.204 --> 13:29.035
Eileen made the choice.

13:33.177 --> 13:37.273
I've been hired to
help out on a new play
at the Royal Court.

13:37.347 --> 13:38.371
I fly out Friday.

13:38.882 --> 13:41.476
You're leaving?
Yeah. You should come.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.452
Collaborate. I loved
working with you, Julia.

13:45.522 --> 13:48.855
I hadn't been this excited
about a project in forever.
Neither had you.

13:48.926 --> 13:50.291
I'm in the middle
of rehearsal.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.827
Yeah, of a sinking ship.

13:52.162 --> 13:54.494
I mean, you said it yourself.
It's making you miserable.

13:54.565 --> 13:56.226
I can't leave.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.798
I haven't gotten
to spend enough time
with Leo as it is.

13:58.869 --> 14:00.632
Bring him.
He'd love London.

14:02.706 --> 14:05.106
He does have
winter break coming up.

14:07.978 --> 14:09.946
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel
right to leave Tom.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.008
Why not? Seems to me
like he's already left you.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.487
Hmm.

14:22.359 --> 14:24.850
<i>I forgot you did
the She Loves Me revival.</i>

14:25.829 --> 14:27.262
Nine Tony nominations.

14:27.331 --> 14:29.231
What can we do for you, Tom?

14:29.299 --> 14:32.598
<i>I wanted to talk to you about
cutting Never Give All
the Heart from the show.</i>

14:33.737 --> 14:36.331
I know producers
have a great
deal of say, but...

14:36.406 --> 14:38.067
Legally, Eileen
isn't a producer.

14:38.141 --> 14:39.574
I'm a "friend of
the production."

14:39.643 --> 14:41.474
Whose opinion
I value highly.

14:41.979 --> 14:43.469
Understood.

14:43.814 --> 14:46.408
Anyway. The song is really
important to Julia.

14:46.483 --> 14:49.008
So important you
came instead of her?

14:49.253 --> 14:51.915
She kind of hates Jerry
with a burning passion.

14:51.989 --> 14:54.116
Like you used to.
Oh, I still do.

14:54.992 --> 14:57.324
I don't need
people to like me.

14:57.427 --> 14:59.987
I need them to
deliver a good show.

15:01.498 --> 15:04.934
And that song,
it's too intellectual.

15:06.236 --> 15:10.366
I like songs that
make me feel something.
And so do you.

15:11.441 --> 15:14.035
Ah. Don't the best do both?

15:15.646 --> 15:17.273
This song is the emotional
core of the show.

15:17.347 --> 15:19.872
It's a downer.
It doesn't have to be.

15:22.185 --> 15:24.050
What if we were
to make you a deal?

15:24.121 --> 15:27.613
Say you change the song
into something that wows us.

15:27.691 --> 15:30.091
Something that
makes us feel good.
You could keep it.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.286
How long do I have?

15:31.361 --> 15:32.623
Twenty-four hours.

15:33.664 --> 15:36.758
After that, I don't want to
ever hear about it again.

15:40.537 --> 15:43.301
So who'd you
get to replace me?
Is she able to sing the role?

15:43.373 --> 15:47.366
Audrey, from my last show,
and optimistically? No.

15:47.444 --> 15:49.036
But at least we
didn't have to cancel.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.874
Maybe I should go in,
give her a few pointers?

15:50.948 --> 15:52.973
No. That is not
a good idea.

15:53.350 --> 15:55.341
What? Jimmy?
You know how he gets.

15:55.419 --> 15:58.445
He's like the Incredible Hulk.
One little thing, and he's
ripping through his shirt.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.490
Come on. You're about
to open on Broadway.

16:00.557 --> 16:02.422
This should be
your last concern.

16:02.859 --> 16:04.850
Five minutes.
Thanks.

16:05.128 --> 16:06.686
I got to go.

16:07.264 --> 16:08.731
Break a leg, okay?

16:08.799 --> 16:10.767
Don't wake the Hulk.

16:18.141 --> 16:20.075
Karen?

16:20.944 --> 16:23.606
Do I know you?
Cynthia Moran.
We met in Boston.

16:24.381 --> 16:26.611
Ellis Boyd's girlfriend?
Ex, actually.

16:26.683 --> 16:28.412
You two aren't
on good terms?

16:28.485 --> 16:33.923
No. Turns out he was kind of
a psychopath. Also gay.
Did you know that?

16:33.991 --> 16:37.392
I had an inkling about both.

16:38.128 --> 16:39.117
So what's he up to now?

16:39.196 --> 16:42.893
I have no idea.
After he got that job
with Jerry, he took off.

16:43.667 --> 16:44.895
Wait, job with Jerry?

16:45.002 --> 16:48.460
<i>Yeah, Jerry Rand.
Isn't he producing Bombshell?</i>

16:49.539 --> 16:53.066
He and Ellis made
some deal or something,
and that's when he left me.

16:53.710 --> 16:56.304
Good riddance, right?
Coming up?

16:56.880 --> 16:58.347
No, no. Go ahead.

17:09.657 --> 17:11.489
Oh, Hey, somebody
tweeted about us!

17:11.926 --> 17:13.758
Oh. No. Never mind.

17:14.096 --> 17:15.461
What'd they say?

17:16.832 --> 17:19.892
<i>"Hit List at the Fringe.
WTF, what a mess.</i>

17:19.969 --> 17:22.801
"Hashtag
60minutesclosertodeath."

17:24.240 --> 17:25.901
Ana's gonna work
with Audrey all day.

17:25.974 --> 17:28.375
It won't matter,
'cause there's not
gonna be a show tonight.

17:28.444 --> 17:29.604
What are you talking about?

17:29.678 --> 17:33.011
We have no director,
there's no star,

17:33.082 --> 17:35.448
we have no second act,
there's no heat
in the theater.

17:35.518 --> 17:37.543
People bought tickets.
We have a responsibility.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.588
To not look like asses?
Yes, I agree.

17:39.655 --> 17:42.852
Canceling is not an option.
I get that you're
upset that Karen bailed...

17:42.925 --> 17:44.722
This is so not about Karen.

17:44.794 --> 17:47.354
But this is the last chance
for our work to be seen.

17:47.563 --> 17:49.497
I'm not giving up
because of one setback.

17:49.565 --> 17:51.931
I'm not, either.
I'm just saving us
the embarrassment.

17:52.001 --> 17:52.990
We'll do it
without you, then.

17:53.069 --> 17:54.058
You know? Good!

17:55.171 --> 17:56.763
I didn't want to
act in this thing
in the first place.

17:56.839 --> 17:59.831
It was you and Karen
that convinced me to,
and it was a stupid idea.

18:00.943 --> 18:04.538
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go get high
and then go to work,

18:04.613 --> 18:08.447
since we spent
everything we had
on last night's disaster.

18:10.519 --> 18:16.424
So Sunday we'll
sit down with Derek,
talk about the projections.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.718
I'm still not
sold on them yet.

18:18.828 --> 18:23.060
After that, I asked Drew
from SpotCo to sit with us
to talk radio ads.

18:26.535 --> 18:27.797
Where are you right now?

18:28.671 --> 18:29.695
I'm here.

18:30.406 --> 18:32.670
No, you're not.
I know you.

18:36.145 --> 18:39.114
Peter asked me to go
to London with him.
And I'm thinking about it.

18:40.416 --> 18:42.816
Before you say anything,
it's not like that.

18:44.186 --> 18:45.210
It's to work.

18:46.188 --> 18:48.247
So you're going to leave
because you didn't
get what you want?

18:48.657 --> 18:50.386
I only said I was
thinking about it.

18:53.996 --> 18:57.329
I get you're upset.
But this is how
collaboration works.

18:57.399 --> 18:58.525
You make compromises.

18:58.601 --> 19:00.933
It's not just that.
It's the whole thing.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.731
<i>Bombshell is troubled, sure.</i>

19:04.140 --> 19:07.109
<i>But it's not like
we've got the problems
Wicked had.</i>

19:07.176 --> 19:08.643
And look what happened.
Nine years later,

19:08.711 --> 19:10.838
it's still one of
the highest-grossing
shows on Broadway.

19:10.913 --> 19:12.642
Yeah, but will ours be,

19:12.715 --> 19:16.481
after Eileen and Jerry
cut everything
I love out of it?

19:17.086 --> 19:19.884
I told you I'm going
to get the song back.

19:19.989 --> 19:21.479
I'm going to.

19:23.225 --> 19:24.988
Give me a chance.

19:28.664 --> 19:34.227
Welcome members of the press.
What you're about to see is
the almost-finished product.

19:34.303 --> 19:39.366
We've been doing some
experimenting with
the tone of the piece.

19:39.508 --> 19:40.497
Uh...

19:40.843 --> 19:43.107
We're just gonna
show you a couple of
scenes and songs.

19:43.179 --> 19:44.976
Just keep in mind that this...

19:45.047 --> 19:49.143
Feel free to laugh! Or cry.
Whatever you're feeling,
all right?

19:49.218 --> 19:51.550
This is live theater,
all right! Don't hold back!

19:55.824 --> 20:00.557
I cannot comprehend
another cruel day on this
earth without you.

20:01.630 --> 20:04.793
I would rather die
a thousand deaths

20:05.434 --> 20:09.268
than not feel the warmth
of your embrace.

20:15.411 --> 20:18.039
Thanks, Ivy,
I really felt that.

20:28.691 --> 20:32.092
Eileen, I was wondering
if I could talk to you.

20:32.161 --> 20:33.355
Sure.

20:33.429 --> 20:35.693
Karen? You ready
for Tom's experiment?

20:35.764 --> 20:37.493
After the number.
Okay.

20:41.036 --> 20:42.264
We've been
waiting for you.

20:42.338 --> 20:44.169
I stopped
to buy you some tea.

20:44.406 --> 20:46.431
Usually when you
bring me presents,

20:46.508 --> 20:48.601
it's because you have
something to hide.

20:48.777 --> 20:52.076
Not anymore. I've changed.

20:52.448 --> 20:55.884
Originally we thought about
this as Marilyn looking back
at all the mistakes

20:55.951 --> 20:58.920
she made with men,
falling too hard too often.

20:58.988 --> 21:02.617
Here's a new idea.
Guys, will you hit
the spots we talked about?

21:02.691 --> 21:04.591
I want you to think about
this as a cautionary tale.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.288
Be empowered,
not wistful.

21:07.663 --> 21:10.461
You've learned your lesson,
now show them.

21:10.532 --> 21:14.628
So what if you moved
between the men?

21:14.703 --> 21:20.039
Joe, Arthur, JFK,
break their hearts.

21:20.109 --> 21:25.274
Show them and us how not
to give all the heart.

21:25.347 --> 21:26.780
Want to give it a try?
Yeah.

21:27.583 --> 21:31.075
Fascinating. You're not
re-envisioning the song,

21:31.153 --> 21:33.144
you're actually just
directing it differently.

21:33.222 --> 21:35.486
And, oh, guess what,
that's my job.

21:35.557 --> 21:38.390
I'm just trying
to save the song.
You can do it if you want.

21:38.460 --> 21:42.191
I would if I agreed
with anything
that you're doing.

21:43.432 --> 21:47.459
Oh, go on, then. Try it.
No one cares what
I think, clearly.

21:48.270 --> 21:53.469
Let's start center.
And start the movement
around "Irishmen."

21:53.976 --> 21:55.273
Just play with it.
Okay.

22:05.321 --> 22:07.516
<i>As the wise man
once wrote</i>

22:07.656 --> 22:10.557
<i>Never give all the heart</i>

22:12.561 --> 22:14.495
<i>Well, it's easy to see</i>

22:14.563 --> 22:16.394
<i>He was writing for me</i>

22:16.465 --> 22:20.799
<i>I just wish I could
play that part</i>

22:21.337 --> 22:25.330
<i>As he scribbled that love
isn't worth thinking of</i>

22:25.407 --> 22:28.774
<i>That it fades out
from kiss to kiss</i>

22:28.877 --> 22:32.108
<i>If I just learned those lines</i>

22:32.181 --> 22:38.814
<i>Well, just think of
the misery I'd miss</i>

22:41.090 --> 22:46.187
I got the idea from
your version of the book.
Look, Marilyn and her men.

22:46.261 --> 22:49.890
<i>As the Irishman said
"Don't put your
heart up to play"</i>

22:50.899 --> 22:54.767
<i>When he warned of the cost
and the heart that he lost</i>

22:54.837 --> 22:59.797
<i>Mr. Yeats really paved the way</i>

22:59.875 --> 23:02.537
<i>For the men that I've known,
well, they've clearly shown</i>

23:02.611 --> 23:03.771
What you do think?

23:03.846 --> 23:08.943
<i>They've been reading him
from the start</i>

23:09.017 --> 23:10.644
<i>'Cause when it comes to me</i>

23:10.719 --> 23:12.516
<i>Well, their kisses come free</i>

23:12.588 --> 23:14.522
This is the complete opposite
of what it's supposed to be.

23:14.590 --> 23:17.150
Julia, you can't be
happy with this, either.

23:17.559 --> 23:19.652
I love it.
So do I.

23:20.229 --> 23:22.561
Good work, Tom. It's in.

23:22.765 --> 23:27.099
<i>I never give all the heart</i>

23:30.072 --> 23:33.803
<i>Never give all the heart</i>

23:36.278 --> 23:37.370
Well, wasn't that lovely.

23:37.446 --> 23:41.883
Okay. Can someone tell me
what I'm doing here if my
opinion no longer matters?

23:41.950 --> 23:43.850
I just asked
what you thought.

23:43.952 --> 23:46.011
What? Sorry?
Of you commandeering my show?

23:46.422 --> 23:48.583
It's my show, too.
I wrote half of it.

23:48.657 --> 23:51.319
Did it not occur to you that
I might have my own idea
about how it should go?

23:51.393 --> 23:53.554
Okay, just checking.

23:53.629 --> 23:56.393
How many Best Director Tonys
have you got, then?

23:56.832 --> 23:59.027
Derek, why don't
you take a break?

23:59.101 --> 24:01.763
Tom, you can go on
working with
Karen on that song.

24:01.837 --> 24:03.805
What? Are you kidding me?

24:03.872 --> 24:05.965
Are we taking
turns directing now?

24:06.041 --> 24:08.532
I'll tell you what,
I'll pop off.
I'll go catch a movie.

24:08.610 --> 24:12.171
You give me a call and
you let me know when I'm next
up at bat. How about that?

24:12.247 --> 24:14.613
Maybe if you got on board
with the creative
vision of the show...

24:14.683 --> 24:18.813
No. The creative
vision of the show, Tom,
is my vision!

24:18.921 --> 24:20.582
I am the director!
This is how it works!

24:21.356 --> 24:24.519
Not when it's the money
I raised at stake.

24:28.764 --> 24:29.753
Thank you, Derek.

24:32.768 --> 24:34.998
Yeah, okay, um...

24:36.371 --> 24:37.998
I'd like to make
a little announcement,
everyone.

24:38.073 --> 24:41.565
If you could just
give me one little
minute of your time, um...

24:42.644 --> 24:47.172
Julia. I'm sorry.
I tried to make
the show we wanted.

24:47.616 --> 24:48.605
Tried?

24:48.684 --> 24:52.051
Oh, and, Jerry,
you truly are what is wrong
with American theater!

24:52.120 --> 24:55.578
And Eileen, you're smarter,
classier and better than
your producing partner,

24:55.657 --> 24:59.252
and if I were you, I wouldn't
agree with a single decision
he makes from here on.

24:59.361 --> 25:01.886
Tom. Oh, Tom.

25:03.365 --> 25:04.627
We've got a long history,
haven't we?

25:04.700 --> 25:08.261
Mmm.
And I'm not sorry to
say that it ends today.

25:09.271 --> 25:12.001
You want to direct
this show so much?
Well, now's your chance.

25:12.074 --> 25:13.439
Because I'm done.

25:14.743 --> 25:17.678
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
sorry, thank you.

25:17.746 --> 25:20.613
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

25:21.984 --> 25:23.542
Some more than others.

25:23.619 --> 25:25.553
Derek?
Sorry, love.

25:27.723 --> 25:29.020
I quit.

25:37.266 --> 25:39.029
Derek. Hey!

25:39.535 --> 25:41.093
You're not really
quitting, are you?

25:41.169 --> 25:42.761
Look, this isn't
what I signed up for.

25:43.205 --> 25:44.797
I don't believe
in this anymore.

25:45.107 --> 25:47.439
You can't leave.
Apparently, I can.

25:48.110 --> 25:50.044
You should find
a way out, as well.

25:50.112 --> 25:51.443
Hey, I'm not like you.

25:51.513 --> 25:54.004
This is my big break.
It may never happen again.

25:54.082 --> 25:55.879
Of course it will.
Just have some
faith in yourself.

25:56.184 --> 25:57.947
Derek!
Eileen.

25:58.787 --> 26:00.186
Come back to rehearsal.

26:00.255 --> 26:01.813
I would, but I quit.

26:02.424 --> 26:05.621
I understand,
but you can't just
walk out of there.

26:05.694 --> 26:06.718
You love this.

26:07.262 --> 26:08.320
"Loved" it.

26:09.331 --> 26:10.491
You're a great
producer, Eileen.

26:10.566 --> 26:12.898
I would love to work
with you on something,
just not this.

26:14.002 --> 26:15.492
Good luck.

26:18.807 --> 26:20.638
I didn't expect
that to happen today.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.734
Eileen, that thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

26:23.045 --> 26:24.069
I'm sorry. I have no time.

26:24.146 --> 26:27.081
I ran into Ellis Boyd's
ex-girlfriend last night.

26:27.149 --> 26:30.744
She said something I can't
shake about Jerry and
Ellis working together?

26:30.819 --> 26:32.286
Jerry and Ellis?

26:32.354 --> 26:33.844
Do you have any idea
what that means?

26:36.024 --> 26:40.222
Listen, don't say anything
about this to anyone, okay?

26:41.396 --> 26:42.886
I've got to go.

26:51.506 --> 26:52.632
Taxi!

26:57.145 --> 27:03.175
After Valmont successfully
seduces Cecile, she composes
a letter to her friend Sophie.

27:04.186 --> 27:08.623
Cecile, my darling
daughter, practice for
your harp recital.

27:09.157 --> 27:11.853
Your fiancé just might
be in attendance.

27:12.227 --> 27:15.128
Yes, Mama.
I do so hope to meet him.

27:21.837 --> 27:23.600
Dear Sophie.

27:24.206 --> 27:28.973
<i>At the convent
of St. Ursaline</i>

27:29.044 --> 27:33.378
<i>Under lock and key
we always felt secure</i>

27:35.183 --> 27:39.882
<i>We were taught
that heaven is divine</i>

27:39.955 --> 27:44.289
<i>And all who enter it
are innocent and pure</i>

27:45.394 --> 27:49.922
<i>And inside
those medieval walls</i>

27:49.998 --> 27:54.594
<i>We had no reason to
believe it wasn't true</i>

27:54.936 --> 28:00.465
<i>But it's hard to stay
strong when one leaves
those holy halls</i>

28:04.446 --> 28:07.813
<i>And, Sophie, that is why
I'm writing this to you</i>

28:09.785 --> 28:13.152
<i>For there's this man, you see
This man, Vicomte Valmont</i>

28:13.221 --> 28:16.486
<i>A second cousin to
the cousin of my mother</i>

28:16.558 --> 28:19.721
<i>Who would look at me
as he played faro with my aunt</i>

28:19.795 --> 28:22.628
<i>And he wasn't looking
at me like a brother</i>

28:22.698 --> 28:26.361
<i>He is with us in Deauville
as my dear mama prepares</i>

28:26.968 --> 28:30.165
<i>For my marriage
she's brokered and arranged</i>

28:30.238 --> 28:36.643
<i>But last night as
I lay still I heard him
coming up the stairs</i>

28:37.512 --> 28:40.572
<i>And now, Sophie,
I am permanently changed</i>

28:42.350 --> 28:45.444
<i>As my corset
he unlaced I pleaded,
"Heaven calls the chaste!"</i>

28:45.520 --> 28:48.284
<i>I begged, "Don't spoil me, sir
Before you I do kneel"</i>

28:48.523 --> 28:51.856
<i>But then spoil me he did
So now I say Heaven Forbid</i>

28:51.927 --> 28:53.622
<i>I'm never stopping,
I'm in heaven</i>

28:53.695 --> 28:55.663
<i>Signed, your loyal
friend, Cecile</i>

28:57.566 --> 29:00.399
Cecile, that racket!
What are you doing in there?

29:00.469 --> 29:01.800
Are you practicing
your lesson?

29:01.870 --> 29:05.203
<i>Yes, Mama. I'm working on
a very hard passage.</i>

29:09.811 --> 29:10.971
<i>At the convent...</i>

29:26.328 --> 29:29.092
This is great work, Ivy.
I see a nomination
in your future.

29:29.164 --> 29:31.064
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

29:31.133 --> 29:32.600
I'm looking forward to it.

29:33.702 --> 29:36.398
He's right.
Your number was great.

29:36.471 --> 29:38.200
So funny.

29:38.507 --> 29:40.998
And because I'm off my meds,
I could actually laugh.

29:41.143 --> 29:43.077
Thank you. I thought
maybe you didn't like it.

29:43.145 --> 29:44.806
I loved it.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.875
Unfortunately, we're
going to have to cut it.

29:48.683 --> 29:49.707
What? Why?

29:51.686 --> 29:56.020
I am the lead of this show.
The audience is
coming to see me.

29:56.158 --> 30:02.154
So if I'm not the funniest, or
saddest, or most anything-est
person in the show,

30:02.531 --> 30:03.896
they'll be disappointed.

30:03.965 --> 30:07.992
It's just one of
the great burdens
of being a celebrity.

30:09.404 --> 30:12.202
I have to be the best
all the time.

30:12.474 --> 30:14.066
So you're saying
I can't be funny, too?

30:14.576 --> 30:17.238
You can be funny.
Just not as funny.

30:19.481 --> 30:21.005
I'm so glad
we had this talk.

30:23.218 --> 30:25.345
Timothy! Timothy!

30:32.394 --> 30:33.588
I wasn't sure you
were going to show.

30:33.662 --> 30:35.630
Yeah, I'm just
going to get my stuff.

30:36.464 --> 30:40.491
You just happened to show up
20 minutes before curtain
to get your stuff?

30:40.969 --> 30:43.563
You put a lot into this.
You should see it through.
Oh, like Karen did?

30:49.611 --> 30:51.476
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:51.546 --> 30:53.605
They fire you
or something?

30:54.082 --> 30:58.246
No, actually,
I could get in big trouble
if the producer finds out.

30:59.187 --> 31:01.655
Look, I know you're
pissed at me.

31:02.190 --> 31:05.455
But I'm here.
Doesn't that
count for something?

31:05.527 --> 31:08.496
Yeah,
you're here for one night.
Then you'll be gone again.

31:08.563 --> 31:09.791
It's not enough.

31:09.865 --> 31:12.333
Get out of my way.
No, I'm trying
to talk to you.

31:14.703 --> 31:16.227
Today sucked.

31:17.706 --> 31:21.369
Rehearsal was crazy.
It made me question why
I'm even doing this at all.

31:21.443 --> 31:24.469
But as soon as I got out
of there, the only place
I wanted to be,

31:24.546 --> 31:28.846
the only person that
I wanted to be with,
was you.

31:28.917 --> 31:30.782
On stage. Singing.

31:32.153 --> 31:34.815
Because when I do,
I remember why
I've ever wanted this.

31:35.457 --> 31:37.516
Yeah, just not enough
to actually stick with it?

31:39.628 --> 31:41.528
You can be mad at me, fine.

31:42.097 --> 31:44.759
Don't take it out
on everyone else.

31:46.768 --> 31:49.100
They worked hard for this.
It's their last performance.

31:49.437 --> 31:51.837
Do it for them.
Do it for yourself.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.142
Jimmy, Karen, we're
opening the house.

32:13.229 --> 32:15.254
Allergy attack?
No.

32:16.599 --> 32:18.066
Migraine?
No.

32:19.001 --> 32:21.629
Stomach ache?
No. I'm crying.

32:21.704 --> 32:23.433
Sometimes I cry
for no reason, too.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.701
Like if I eat a really
good peach cobbler...

32:25.775 --> 32:30.007
There's a reason!
The show is terrible!

32:30.079 --> 32:31.876
Ooh! Gossip. Which show?

32:32.949 --> 32:34.280
Our show.

32:34.617 --> 32:36.608
It's really, really bad.

32:37.420 --> 32:39.411
I've been thinking
the same thing for days.

32:39.488 --> 32:42.980
Everybody in it,
except for you and me,
is awful.

32:44.327 --> 32:48.024
No, you're really,
really bad, too.

32:48.464 --> 32:49.795
Me?
Yeah.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.163
Your choices are all wrong.

32:54.236 --> 32:55.601
The set is ridiculous.

32:55.671 --> 32:59.937
And the one thing,
the one thing that
I was holding onto,

33:00.009 --> 33:02.341
my song, you cut.

33:02.478 --> 33:04.742
And why? So that you
can dance around
in your underwear

33:04.814 --> 33:06.247
on stage a little
while longer?

33:06.649 --> 33:08.173
Nobody wants
to see that.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.842
Some people do.
Nobody.

33:10.953 --> 33:11.942
Wow.

33:12.288 --> 33:13.312
Yeah.

33:16.058 --> 33:17.184
I'm fired, right?

33:17.259 --> 33:19.124
No. No.

33:20.796 --> 33:24.698
That's the most honesty
I've heard in 20 years.

33:25.134 --> 33:26.658
You reach
a certain level of fame,

33:26.736 --> 33:28.499
and everybody just
says "yes" all the time.

33:28.571 --> 33:31.938
Nobody tells you the truth.
Nobody.

33:34.810 --> 33:35.799
You can have your song back.

33:35.878 --> 33:37.140
Really?
Yeah.

33:39.015 --> 33:41.506
Just always keep
telling me the truth, okay?

33:41.617 --> 33:43.812
Can you do something for me?

33:48.591 --> 33:52.083
Dumplings.
Kung pao chicken.
Cold noodles.

33:52.728 --> 33:53.752
Nah.

33:53.829 --> 33:56.923
That's what we always eat
when we're really depressed.

33:56.999 --> 34:00.526
Then we feel fat and
we get more depressed.
That's what we do.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.936
I'm not depressed.
I'm excited.

34:05.174 --> 34:07.836
I'm sorry?
Were we not in
the same rehearsal?

34:07.910 --> 34:11.676
It's the best thing
that could have happened.
The bomb went off.

34:11.746 --> 34:13.976
Derek's what was toxic
about the production.

34:14.050 --> 34:17.781
Think about all
the problems we had.
They all go back to him.

34:17.853 --> 34:19.013
What about Rebecca Duvall?

34:19.688 --> 34:21.349
Almost all him.

34:21.456 --> 34:24.221
And without Derek,
we could make it the show
we both want it to be.

34:25.127 --> 34:27.186
We'll find a director
who doesn't play
divide and conquer.

34:27.263 --> 34:29.254
I mean, are we
a team or aren't we?

34:30.166 --> 34:31.690
What about Jerry?

34:32.333 --> 34:35.735
We'll get Eileen on our side.
She'll make him come around.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.507
Oh, it's like
she has us wired.

34:40.476 --> 34:41.534
Eileen?

34:44.013 --> 34:45.036
What?

34:47.016 --> 34:48.074
Can you come
to Chinatown?

35:01.730 --> 35:05.393
<i>I'm not scared
to tell the truth</i>

35:07.369 --> 35:11.863
<i>I've been to hell and back
And I went with you</i>

35:14.009 --> 35:18.070
<i>Remind me what we were before?</i>

35:19.081 --> 35:24.542
<i>When we said
"You are mine, and I am yours"</i>

35:26.922 --> 35:31.484
<i>I don't know much,
but I know myself</i>

35:32.995 --> 35:37.659
<i>And I don't want
to love anybody else</i>

35:38.968 --> 35:43.905
<i>So let's break the spell
and lift the curse</i>

35:44.240 --> 35:48.267
<i>Remember why we
fell for each other</i>

35:48.410 --> 35:51.140
<i>Headfirst</i>

35:51.680 --> 35:55.480
<i>Look at this
heart-shaped wreckage</i>

35:55.551 --> 35:57.781
<i>What have we done?</i>

35:57.853 --> 36:01.584
<i>We have got scars from battles</i>

36:01.657 --> 36:03.955
<i>And nobody won</i>

36:04.160 --> 36:07.891
<i>We can start over, better</i>

36:08.063 --> 36:10.031
<i>Both of us know</i>

36:10.099 --> 36:13.967
<i>If we just let
the broken pieces</i>

36:14.336 --> 36:19.103
<i>Let the broken pieces go</i>

36:20.776 --> 36:25.213
<i>Let the broken pieces go</i>

36:26.248 --> 36:30.912
<i>Just hold on to
each other tonight</i>

36:35.591 --> 36:39.527
<i>Look at this
heart-shaped wreckage</i>

36:39.795 --> 36:41.990
<i>What have we done?</i>

36:42.064 --> 36:45.864
<i>We have got scars from battles</i>

36:45.968 --> 36:48.300
<i>Nobody won</i>

36:48.370 --> 36:51.806
<i>We can start over, better</i>

36:52.341 --> 36:54.241
<i>Both of us know</i>

36:54.310 --> 36:58.542
<i>If we just let
the broken pieces</i>

36:58.948 --> 37:01.542
<i>Let the broken pieces</i>

37:01.884 --> 37:04.944
<i>Let the broken pieces</i>

37:05.487 --> 37:08.217
<i>Let the broken pieces</i>

37:28.578 --> 37:30.341
Tomorrow we go into tech.

37:30.413 --> 37:34.816
Now is the absolute
last moment to tweak
anything major.

37:35.018 --> 37:40.752
So I thought it would
be nice if we took the time
to say whatever it is we feel.

37:41.191 --> 37:42.215
Anything.

37:43.660 --> 37:44.684
Constructive,

37:45.528 --> 37:46.620
destructive...

37:46.696 --> 37:48.391
Anything at all.

37:51.001 --> 37:52.298
Fine.

37:52.569 --> 37:55.367
Fine. You don't have to
talk about each other.

37:56.606 --> 37:58.073
How about me?

37:58.174 --> 38:00.233
What do you think
of my performance?

38:06.883 --> 38:07.907
Anyone?

38:09.319 --> 38:12.482
You guys, he's asking
us to be honest.

38:12.822 --> 38:14.847
He means it.
He wants to hear the truth.

38:15.525 --> 38:17.425
This is our chance
to make it good.

38:17.794 --> 38:19.989
Just tell him how bad it is
and we can make it better.

38:20.297 --> 38:22.822
Please, tell me.

38:28.638 --> 38:29.696
It's dreadful.

38:29.773 --> 38:30.933
Appalling.

38:31.007 --> 38:33.532
I've never been
so embarrassed by
my work before.

38:33.610 --> 38:35.100
<i>And I was in
Urban Cowboy.</i>

38:35.211 --> 38:36.269
It's that bad.

38:36.346 --> 38:38.075
- It's really bad.
- It's just awful.

38:38.148 --> 38:40.582
Yeah, it's terrible.
Unbelievable.

38:40.650 --> 38:43.312
Is any of it any good?

38:44.220 --> 38:48.156
The text was.
The music is.
The cast is.

38:48.425 --> 38:50.325
You can be, too,
if you want to be.

38:51.695 --> 38:53.959
Do we still have time
to make some changes?

38:54.297 --> 38:55.696
Absolutely.

38:55.865 --> 38:56.854
Okay.

39:01.604 --> 39:03.731
Hey. You came.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.471
I did.

39:05.675 --> 39:07.267
It has real promise.

39:07.577 --> 39:08.703
So, you really quit, huh?

39:08.778 --> 39:10.040
It appears I did.

39:10.113 --> 39:12.206
You ruled!
She did.

39:13.049 --> 39:14.107
Thank you.

39:14.451 --> 39:16.817
Nice work.
You, too.

39:16.886 --> 39:19.946
I agree. You were wonderful.

39:20.490 --> 39:22.549
Where can I find
the writers?
They're right here.

39:22.625 --> 39:25.253
I'm Kyle, I did the book.
Jimmy wrote the music
and lyrics.

39:25.328 --> 39:28.729
Scott Nichols.
I'm the artistic director
at Manhattan Theater Workshop.

39:28.798 --> 39:30.698
Wow. And you came
to see our show?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.461
I'll admit I only
came because the show

39:32.535 --> 39:33.968
I had tickets
for got canceled,

39:34.037 --> 39:37.438
but I'm glad I did.
It's really intriguing.

39:37.507 --> 39:39.202
It's just the kind of
project that I look for.

39:39.576 --> 39:40.770
Who's the director?

39:40.844 --> 39:42.141
We don't have one.

39:42.746 --> 39:43.906
Yeah, you do.

39:44.781 --> 39:46.271
Derek?

39:46.349 --> 39:47.338
Hi, Scott.
How you doing?

39:47.417 --> 39:49.749
<i>What are you doing here?
Aren't you directing
Bombshell?</i>

39:49.819 --> 39:51.081
Not anymore, no.

39:51.755 --> 39:53.620
And you'd both be
on board to star?

39:54.557 --> 39:56.149
I'm not an actor.
Yes, he is.

39:57.060 --> 39:58.493
And what about you?

39:58.561 --> 40:00.825
<i>I can't.
I'm in Bombshell.</i>

40:00.897 --> 40:02.558
Oh, that's too bad.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.659
Would you all like
to go and have a drink
and talk about the show?

40:05.735 --> 40:07.362
God, yes.

40:09.906 --> 40:11.339
Where we going?

40:14.677 --> 40:16.110
Hey. You're coming, right?

40:16.713 --> 40:20.012
Hey, don't you have
to be at rehearsal
early tomorrow morning?

40:20.183 --> 40:22.845
Yeah. Well, have fun.

40:23.686 --> 40:25.654
Yeah, see you around.

40:41.571 --> 40:42.560
What's that?

40:43.106 --> 40:46.166
That's proof that Jerry
is a lying son of a bitch.

40:46.543 --> 40:50.445
It's a background
check on Nick Felder.
Ellis did it last year.

40:51.314 --> 40:52.838
I found it in Jerry's office.

40:53.249 --> 40:54.910
Wait, what does
that mean?

40:54.984 --> 40:58.681
It means that Jerry
was paying Ellis
for information

40:58.755 --> 41:02.350
so he could shut down the show
and take it over himself.

41:02.425 --> 41:03.790
Mission accomplished.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.657
Oh, my God.

41:07.163 --> 41:08.528
Have you talked to him?

41:08.965 --> 41:11.934
No, and I'm not going to
until I get the show back.

41:12.001 --> 41:13.866
Then I'll kill him
if he's lucky.

41:15.605 --> 41:17.129
What do we do
until then?

41:17.807 --> 41:20.241
Even if we got a new
director tomorrow,

41:20.310 --> 41:22.505
he or she would
need weeks of prep.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.243
What if he were
already prepped?

41:25.315 --> 41:26.304
What do you mean?

41:26.382 --> 41:27.872
We have a director.

41:32.222 --> 41:33.246
Oh, my God.

41:34.457 --> 41:39.485
We have a director.
Tom, we have a director!

41:41.297 --> 41:43.060
Who?
You!

41:43.733 --> 41:45.496
You know this show
better than anyone.

41:45.568 --> 41:48.867
You know the cast,
the costumes,
the choreography,

41:48.938 --> 41:52.237
sometimes he does it
around the apartment when
he thinks no one's looking.

41:52.308 --> 41:55.038
Look what you did
today in rehearsal.

41:55.345 --> 41:58.075
You've got the vision, Tom.
You see the show.

41:58.581 --> 42:00.310
Like Derek used to.

42:00.550 --> 42:04.042
Even better.
'Cause you see it the way
we want it to be.

42:04.654 --> 42:08.385
I will be with you
every step of the way.

42:08.725 --> 42:10.283
What do you say?

42:11.227 --> 42:12.888
<i>You want to save
Bombshell, or what?</i>

42:21.905 --> 42:23.270
I thought you'd never ask.
