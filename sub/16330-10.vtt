WEBVTT

00:00.763 --> 00:02.698
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:02.723 --> 00:05.959
She can't remember who
she is, where she came from,

00:05.984 --> 00:09.489
nothing before she crawled out
of that bag in Times Square.

00:09.491 --> 00:10.924
Sandstorm is responsible

00:10.926 --> 00:13.860
for over a dozen domestic
terror attacks in total.

00:13.862 --> 00:15.128
They're gonna blow up the power grid.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.129
Get out! It's a trap!

00:16.131 --> 00:18.264
No!

00:18.266 --> 00:19.199
Nooo!

00:19.201 --> 00:20.934
Got the chance to start over again.

00:20.936 --> 00:23.269
And now you will, too.

00:23.271 --> 00:24.843
You work for them, don't you?

00:24.868 --> 00:26.679
- Work for who?
- They knew everything!

00:26.704 --> 00:27.773
Please, you have to believe me.

00:27.797 --> 00:29.884
FBI. You're under r arre.

00:47.170 --> 00:48.636
God.

00:48.638 --> 00:51.138
God... No, no, no.

00:51.140 --> 00:54.210
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

00:54.235 --> 00:55.866
I never... I never meant...

00:55.891 --> 00:57.319
Don't come near me.

01:09.745 --> 01:12.925
Hey... Hey, you're okay.

01:12.950 --> 01:15.083
I know you're afraid. It's okay.

01:16.803 --> 01:17.873
Who are you?

01:18.708 --> 01:19.778
I'm your sister,

01:19.803 --> 01:22.342
and I'm gonna explain everything, okay?

01:22.367 --> 01:23.842
I just need you to relax.

01:23.867 --> 01:24.944
Where are you taking me?

01:24.972 --> 01:26.792
I'm taking you somewhere safe.

01:26.817 --> 01:28.943
Okay? Somewhere where we can talk.

01:28.968 --> 01:30.434
You shot me.

01:30.436 --> 01:33.103
What? No. No, I didn't.

01:33.105 --> 01:34.404
I promise, I didn't...

01:44.450 --> 01:46.692
Please, stop, I just need to... no!

01:54.927 --> 01:57.027
Don't move. Roman.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.462
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

01:58.464 --> 02:01.011
If you can just come back to the car...

02:01.667 --> 02:03.567
Please.

02:10.074 --> 02:11.675
Please, stop.

02:11.677 --> 02:13.380
I am trying to help you.

02:22.912 --> 02:23.912
Roman!

02:24.523 --> 02:25.523
Roman!

02:27.393 --> 02:30.135
Roman! Stop!

02:57.538 --> 02:58.904
Hi.

02:58.906 --> 03:01.874
The surgeon said everything went great.

03:01.876 --> 03:03.275
How do you feel?

03:03.277 --> 03:05.539
All right, I'm...

03:08.050 --> 03:09.797
I'm good.

03:09.799 --> 03:11.766
I'm good money.

03:11.768 --> 03:14.368
Hey, I think that's the morphine talking.

03:14.370 --> 03:16.137
Are you going through a dry spell?

03:16.139 --> 03:17.152
Shut up.

03:17.177 --> 03:19.607
So you're scheming on guys
passed out in the hospital?

03:19.609 --> 03:21.642
Something's wrong, Tasha.

03:21.644 --> 03:24.579
I was worried about you.

03:24.581 --> 03:26.447
Thank you for being here.

03:33.156 --> 03:35.590
From the moment
we entered the compound,

03:35.592 --> 03:37.492
there was no cell signal.

03:37.494 --> 03:39.427
We split up just as planned.

03:39.429 --> 03:41.629
The signal returned just before...

03:41.631 --> 03:43.030
Get out! It's a trap!

03:44.334 --> 03:46.234
Just before detonation.

03:46.236 --> 03:48.636
I should've figured this out sooner.

03:48.638 --> 03:50.371
Don't do this, all right?

03:50.373 --> 03:51.739
You got people out.

03:51.741 --> 03:53.474
12 agents are dead, Kurt.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.254
None of us saw that coming.

03:56.279 --> 03:59.213
None of us.

03:59.215 --> 04:00.948
Shepherd...

04:00.950 --> 04:03.451
Shepherd never wanted to
destroy the power grid.

04:03.453 --> 04:05.119
No, she wanted to destroy the team.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.188
Yeah, but not all of us.

04:07.190 --> 04:11.785
By faking Allie's emergency, she...
she was protecting you.

04:11.810 --> 04:14.544
She wanted you alive,
and we need to figure out why.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.379
First, we have to find Jane.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.648
Kurt, I'm... I'm not hopeful.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.317
Shepherd created the perfect trap.

04:21.319 --> 04:22.886
First, she invented a false threat

04:22.888 --> 04:24.981
and then she used Jane to
lure us into the compound.

04:25.006 --> 04:27.423
Because she knew Jane was on our side.

04:27.425 --> 04:29.926
Which means now Jane's expendable.

04:29.928 --> 04:31.394
So Shepherd...

04:31.396 --> 04:33.897
may have killed her.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.466
Or Jane could be playing us... again.

04:36.468 --> 04:37.800
If she wanted to play us,

04:37.802 --> 04:39.802
her best move would
be to stay in our ranks

04:39.804 --> 04:42.005
and funnel intel into Sandstorm.

04:42.007 --> 04:44.774
<i>Jane was... Jane is loyal.</i>

04:44.776 --> 04:46.910
So, Tasha, I want you to put out a APB.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.913
I want every cop in the
tri-state area searching for...

04:49.915 --> 04:51.881
Please, I just need
to see if they're okay!

04:51.883 --> 04:54.250
Hey, stop! What are you two doing?

04:54.252 --> 04:56.257
We picked her up in the lobby.

04:56.282 --> 04:57.548
We're just following Pellington's orders.

04:57.550 --> 04:59.017
Get them off her, now.

04:59.019 --> 05:00.518
I'm so sorry.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.054
Kurt, I'm sorry,
I didn't know that it was a trap.

05:03.056 --> 05:04.389
- It's okay.
- I swear I didn't know.

05:04.391 --> 05:09.027
Hey... we know. We understand, okay?

05:09.029 --> 05:11.796
I just... I thought
that Shepherd might've...

05:11.798 --> 05:13.364
Where...

05:13.366 --> 05:14.666
Where's the rest of the team?

05:14.668 --> 05:16.416
Reade had to have emergency surgery.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.907
He's in recovery now.

05:18.538 --> 05:20.071
Jane, we lost a lot of agents.

05:20.073 --> 05:21.339
No, where's Patterson?

05:21.341 --> 05:22.840
Patterson was here during the attack.

05:22.842 --> 05:23.975
No, where's Patterson right now?

05:23.977 --> 05:25.009
Talked to her a little while ago.

05:25.011 --> 05:26.778
She went to go check on Borden.

05:26.780 --> 05:27.979
Borden?

05:27.981 --> 05:30.615
Borden is a mole for Sandstorm.

05:30.617 --> 05:31.716
What are you talking about?

05:31.718 --> 05:33.918
He doesn't work for us.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.119
He works for Shepherd.

05:35.121 --> 05:37.185
For how long?

05:37.210 --> 05:38.810
From the beginning.

05:40.321 --> 05:43.422
Shepherd wanted him to monitor you.

05:43.424 --> 05:47.593
So, what, Borden was just dating
Patterson for access to intel?

05:47.595 --> 05:49.562
Tasha, try Patterson's cell.
I'll try Borden's.

05:49.564 --> 05:51.197
I can't find their signals.

05:51.199 --> 05:52.532
Look, he must've taken the batteries out.

05:52.534 --> 05:54.534
No, he... he might've
taken her to Shepherd.

05:54.536 --> 05:56.502
Every agent in this building
will start looking for her.

05:56.504 --> 05:58.638
- We'll find her.
- Roman might be able to help.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.139
Maybe he knows where
Borden could've taken her.

06:00.141 --> 06:02.208
What? You're still in contact with Roman?

06:02.210 --> 06:04.076
While you were raiding the compound,

06:04.078 --> 06:07.034
Shepherd had me tied up
in front of a projector.

06:08.691 --> 06:11.525
She wanted me to watch you die.

06:11.527 --> 06:13.660
And then she wanted Roman
to kill me, but he couldn't.

06:14.797 --> 06:16.096
He chose you over her.

06:16.098 --> 06:18.131
So she turned on him.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.300
But we fought our
way out, and then...

06:20.302 --> 06:21.935
But then I...

06:21.937 --> 06:25.105
Then what?

06:25.107 --> 06:28.208
I erased his memory. I ZIP-ed him.

06:28.210 --> 06:30.818
I was trying to do the right thing.

06:30.843 --> 06:32.810
I was trying to bring
him back to the FBI.

06:32.835 --> 06:34.758
Where is he now?

06:34.783 --> 06:36.617
I don't know.

06:36.642 --> 06:38.888
When he woke up, he overpowered me,

06:38.890 --> 06:42.158
and... I lost him. I'm sorry.

06:43.623 --> 06:45.261
Take a team to Borden's.

06:45.263 --> 06:46.796
I'll send one to Patterson's.

06:46.798 --> 06:48.398
The rest of us, we're
gonna look for Roman.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.766
Yeah, I mean, he knows Sandstorm well.

06:49.768 --> 06:51.634
He should know where the
fallback safe houses are.

06:51.636 --> 06:52.735
Sorry, hate to state the obvious,

06:52.737 --> 06:54.103
but his memory has been wiped.

06:54.105 --> 06:56.072
How is he going to be useful at all?

06:56.074 --> 06:58.474
I remembered things right away.
Roman might, too.

06:58.476 --> 07:00.076
Roman is our best bet.

07:00.078 --> 07:03.479
We get him to talk,
hopefully we'll get Patterson back.

07:03.481 --> 07:05.815
If she isn't already dead.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.456
Don't move.

07:54.160 --> 07:59.096
It's nice to meet you,
Special Agent Patterson.

07:59.098 --> 08:00.898
What? Don't do this.

08:00.900 --> 08:03.334
Do you see this? My son did that.

08:03.336 --> 08:07.076
So I have no time for
your misplaced loyalties.

08:07.101 --> 08:08.734
You should've killed her yourself.

08:08.736 --> 08:09.902
But you were weak.

08:09.904 --> 08:11.270
No, I was smart.

08:11.272 --> 08:12.705
Look, think of the asset she can be,

08:12.707 --> 08:15.231
of the intel she can provide.

08:15.278 --> 08:16.619
If you kill her, your judgment's

08:16.644 --> 08:19.945
been clouded by emotion, not mine.

08:19.947 --> 08:22.832
You know how I extract information.

08:26.721 --> 08:28.554
Why else do you think I brought her here?

08:31.326 --> 08:32.825
Okay.

08:34.529 --> 08:35.861
I'll get intel from her.

08:37.899 --> 08:39.376
Get on the table.

08:40.268 --> 08:42.068
Where are we on finding Roman?

08:42.070 --> 08:43.402
I'm using Patterson's system

08:43.404 --> 08:46.138
to autodial Roman's cell
phone every 15 seconds.

08:46.140 --> 08:48.415
- But he hasn't picked up.
- But we're tracking it?

08:48.440 --> 08:50.955
I tried, but all of my
calls keep getting routed

08:50.980 --> 08:53.252
through the same cell tower,
and that narrows his location

08:53.276 --> 08:55.576
down to somewhere in this 30-mile radius.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.132
It's bigger than all of Manhattan.

08:57.157 --> 08:58.479
So no luck on the car
that he was driving?

08:58.481 --> 08:59.613
Nothing yet.

08:59.615 --> 09:01.448
What about Borden?

09:01.450 --> 09:03.017
Initial tests confirm
that all of the blood

09:03.019 --> 09:05.386
at Borden's apartment is Patterson's.

09:05.388 --> 09:06.520
How could Borden do this?

09:06.522 --> 09:08.122
Have we got an APB out on his car?

09:08.124 --> 09:09.924
Yes, but no sign of it yet.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.661
It's Roman, he's finally picking up.

09:14.279 --> 09:15.812
<i>Hello?</i>

09:15.814 --> 09:18.314
Roman, please don't hang up, okay?

09:18.316 --> 09:20.783
<i>- Who is this?
- I'm your sister.</i>

09:20.785 --> 09:22.819
<i>Are you that woman from the car?</i>

09:22.821 --> 09:25.555
Yes, but I didn't shoot you, okay?

09:25.557 --> 09:26.689
I want to keep you safe.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.723
<i>Can you tell me where you are?</i>

09:27.725 --> 09:29.392
What the hell happened to me?

09:29.394 --> 09:31.294
<i>I promise, I'm going
to tell you everything,</i>

09:31.296 --> 09:34.797
but it's gonna have to be in person.

09:34.799 --> 09:36.566
Roman, look in your pocket.

09:36.568 --> 09:39.602
<i>There's a coin in there,
it's a very special coin.</i>

09:39.604 --> 09:42.738
<i>I gave it to you when we were little.</i>

09:42.740 --> 09:44.207
How'd you know that?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.512
<i>Because I know you
better than anyone,</i>

09:45.536 --> 09:47.543
<i>and I know exactly what
you're going through</i>

09:47.545 --> 09:49.579
<i>right now, and it's hell.</i>

09:49.581 --> 09:52.415
I know that, okay?
But I need you to trust me.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.384
<i>Can you describe where you're at?</i>

09:55.386 --> 09:58.421
"The best eggs you've ever had."

09:58.423 --> 10:00.189
What do you mean?

10:00.191 --> 10:01.457
That's the slogan for Loui's.

10:01.459 --> 10:03.259
It's a diner chain.

10:03.261 --> 10:05.713
Hey, Roman, are you in a diner?

10:05.738 --> 10:07.905
Is there... is there
anything else you can see?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.907
There are four diner locations

10:09.909 --> 10:11.675
and 18 billboards with that tagline

10:11.677 --> 10:12.676
in our search radius.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.846
Or maybe a... A landmark?

10:21.420 --> 10:23.086
Roman, I... I don't understand.

10:23.088 --> 10:25.889
Mile marker in Putnam County.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.491
Roman, I'm coming to get you.

10:27.493 --> 10:28.392
Okay, but I need you stay

10:28.394 --> 10:29.660
<i>right where you are.</i>

10:29.662 --> 10:31.261
I gotta go.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.397
I'm hungry.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.398
Roman?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.866
He hung up.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.239
All right, you keep
working on the Borden angle.

10:38.264 --> 10:39.864
Jane and I will bring Roman in.

10:43.650 --> 10:44.949
Shepherd.

10:44.951 --> 10:46.651
- Not now.
- It's urgent.

10:51.892 --> 10:53.358
Who the hell are you?

10:53.360 --> 10:56.461
How long have you been working for her?

10:56.463 --> 10:57.829
Tell me!

10:57.854 --> 10:59.171
If you had just stayed at the office,

10:59.173 --> 11:00.306
none of this would've happened.

11:00.308 --> 11:02.541
I left to check on you.

11:02.543 --> 11:04.510
I guess that's pretty stupid.

11:04.512 --> 11:06.812
But then again,
I thought you were my boyfriend.

11:06.814 --> 11:10.216
I know this hard and
impossible to understand.

11:10.218 --> 11:14.487
But everything I have done
has been for my late wife.

11:14.489 --> 11:17.223
Wow. That's great.

11:17.225 --> 11:19.792
That's just... what
every girl wants to hear

11:19.794 --> 11:21.927
as she's being tied to a plank with wire.

11:21.929 --> 11:24.230
Chris lived to help others.

11:24.232 --> 11:28.234
She made lives better all over the world.

11:28.236 --> 11:31.237
She helped build the
hospital that she died in.

11:31.239 --> 11:33.420
And it only stood for one month

11:33.445 --> 11:36.847
before an unsanctioned American
bombing turned it to ash.

11:38.274 --> 11:39.606
The government that murdered her

11:39.608 --> 11:41.375
is the same government you work for.

11:41.377 --> 11:43.544
You are on the wrong side.

11:43.546 --> 11:45.312
I am?

11:45.314 --> 11:47.014
I'm sorry.

11:47.016 --> 11:50.451
Your side... sounds really cool.

11:50.453 --> 11:53.169
So you should just go ahead

11:53.194 --> 11:57.282
and untie me... because I'm converted.

11:58.027 --> 12:01.295
If I were you...

12:01.297 --> 12:04.098
I would tell Shepherd everything.

12:11.635 --> 12:13.702
<i>Are you that woman from the car?</i>

12:13.704 --> 12:15.237
It's like he doesn't remember anything.

12:15.239 --> 12:16.805
She must've ZIP-ed Roman.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.474
<i>Can you tell me where you are?</i>

12:18.476 --> 12:20.309
We have to find him.

12:29.453 --> 12:31.520
Are you a pirate?

12:34.191 --> 12:35.791
I don't know.

12:35.793 --> 12:38.941
You're funny. Is that your treasure?

12:43.717 --> 12:44.832
It's shiny.

12:52.871 --> 12:54.671
Do I know you?

12:54.673 --> 12:56.707
Yep, I'm a pirate, too.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.582
Sorry, is my daughter bothering you?

13:07.928 --> 13:09.428
Can I get you anything else?

13:12.624 --> 13:13.657
Some dessert?

13:17.550 --> 13:19.016
Sorry, what?

13:19.018 --> 13:20.017
Dessert?

13:20.019 --> 13:21.552
Maybe a slice of pie?

13:23.356 --> 13:24.855
Sir, are you all right?

13:31.230 --> 13:33.397
Take the girl, get out of here.

13:35.435 --> 13:36.901
Go.

13:46.327 --> 13:47.894
Hey there, Roman.

13:47.896 --> 13:49.695
Your sister sent me to pick you up.

13:52.567 --> 13:54.267
You know my sister?

13:54.269 --> 13:55.637
She's worried about you.

13:56.762 --> 13:58.204
It's not safe here.

14:11.494 --> 14:13.627
I should wait here for my sister.

14:13.629 --> 14:14.628
I'm gonna take you to her.

14:14.630 --> 14:15.829
Roman, it's fine.

14:15.831 --> 14:17.936
We gotta get you out of here.

14:17.961 --> 14:18.961
Roman, it's all right.

14:38.387 --> 14:40.431
FBI! Drop your weapon!

15:25.944 --> 15:27.278
When you brought me in,

15:27.280 --> 15:28.880
you didn't tie me up and
treat me like an animal.

15:28.882 --> 15:31.449
You hadn't just tried
to get all of us killed.

15:31.451 --> 15:33.117
Reade is in the trauma ward because...

15:33.119 --> 15:34.819
That was Shepherd, not Roman!

15:34.821 --> 15:36.354
All right, enough, you two.
We don't have time for this.

15:36.356 --> 15:37.217
Jane's right.

15:37.242 --> 15:38.856
We need Roman's help to find Patterson.

15:38.858 --> 15:40.324
So if we treat him like the enemy...

15:40.326 --> 15:41.106
Which he is.

15:41.131 --> 15:42.960
Yes, but if we treat him like that,

15:42.962 --> 15:44.062
he may not cooperate.

15:44.064 --> 15:46.297
Even if he wants to cooperate,

15:46.299 --> 15:47.899
what is he going to say?

15:47.901 --> 15:49.467
"I don't remember anything"?

15:49.469 --> 15:52.303
We're here wasting time
while Patterson is still...

15:52.305 --> 15:53.571
We're all worried about Patterson.

15:53.573 --> 15:55.273
But right now, the only real lead we have

15:55.275 --> 15:57.642
is sitting in that room,
so let's just try and focus.

15:57.644 --> 15:58.843
I wanna go in first.

15:58.845 --> 16:00.178
I can get through to him.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.245
I agree.

16:01.247 --> 16:03.414
And I want to tell Roman the truth.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.582
Everything.

16:04.584 --> 16:06.117
Including that I ZIP-ed him.

16:06.119 --> 16:07.443
- You're crazy.
- Tasha.

16:07.468 --> 16:08.490
You guys can stay here

16:08.515 --> 16:10.715
and talk to the forgetful terrorist,

16:10.740 --> 16:12.935
but I'm going to go find a real lead.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.097
Jane, you can't tell your brother

16:17.122 --> 16:18.175
that you ZIP-ed him.

16:18.177 --> 16:19.977
How can he trust me if I lie to him?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.312
Well, how can he trust you if you don't?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.113
Think about it, Jane.

16:23.115 --> 16:25.049
When you came out of that bag,

16:25.051 --> 16:27.117
how'd you feel about the
people that put you in there?

16:27.119 --> 16:29.987
You hated them.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.856
He will hate you for doing this, too.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.626
You have to lie to him.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.995
Yeah, and what if he
remembers being ZIP-ed?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.730
Weeks or even years from now,

16:39.732 --> 16:41.665
he could realize our entire relationship

16:41.667 --> 16:43.200
was based on a lie.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.202
It's a risk we have to take, Jane.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.545
Otherwise, he will never
tell us where Patterson is.

16:50.476 --> 16:54.411
I need you to answer a few questions.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.181
And I need you to untie me.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.916
My guess is we both don't get our way.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.584
I'm gonna get my way.

17:00.586 --> 17:06.256
Dr. Borden, why don't
you tell her what this is for?

17:06.258 --> 17:08.922
It's for fine-needle aspiration biopsies.

17:08.946 --> 17:12.128
For taking tissue samples,
in layman's terms.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.131
Don't worry.

17:14.133 --> 17:18.636
I... I'd much rather
do this the easy way.

17:18.637 --> 17:23.107
So, what does the FBI
know about Phase Two?

17:25.277 --> 17:29.179
You know, I know a lot about you.

17:30.316 --> 17:33.784
I know you love your job.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.055
You love solving our puzzles.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.659
And you're good at it. You're gifted.

17:41.661 --> 17:46.830
Behind all the puzzles...
Well, all of science, really...

17:46.832 --> 17:49.233
There are two tasks, right?

17:49.235 --> 17:53.637
Observe and analyze.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.639
I bet it would be really hard

17:55.641 --> 17:59.276
to make a thoughtful
observation if you...

17:59.278 --> 18:03.113
say... couldn't hear.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.684
So...

18:06.686 --> 18:10.587
What do you know about Phase Two?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.659
I'm so sorry about all of this.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.131
Roman, I understand that you're angry.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.367
But I need your help.

18:23.369 --> 18:26.603
A friend of mine is missing,
and you may know where she is.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.506
No, I don't.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.141
Everything is empty.

18:31.143 --> 18:35.512
And I know exactly what that feels like.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.114
When I was brought to the FBI,

18:37.116 --> 18:41.118
I couldn't remember who
I was or what I'd done.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.153
I was empty.

18:43.155 --> 18:46.156
And these people helped me feel full again.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.025
<i>They took care of you?</i>

18:48.027 --> 18:50.127
<i>And they're
gonna take care of you.</i>

18:50.129 --> 18:52.730
I don't know who I can trust.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.164
You can trust me.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.632
I'm not gonna lie to you.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.168
<i>Why can't I remember anything?</i>

18:58.170 --> 19:00.704
<i>Because your memory was erased.</i>

19:02.108 --> 19:03.774
By our mother.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.810
She erased mine, too.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.079
Why? Why would she do this?

19:09.081 --> 19:10.781
Why would she want to hurt me?

19:10.783 --> 19:13.150
Because she's a terrible person.

19:13.175 --> 19:15.796
And when we were little,
she took us from an orphanage,

19:15.821 --> 19:19.189
and now she is the leader
of terrorist organization.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.191
Did she take your friend?

19:21.193 --> 19:23.794
A man who works with her did.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.529
I'm sorry.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.898
You can help us get her back.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.470
Please, tell her what you know.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.339
For your own sake, just...

19:35.341 --> 19:37.541
Stop this, it's inhumane.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.611
Please, a perforated eardrum heals.

19:40.613 --> 19:44.014
Meaning I can do this again and again.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.450
So... answer me this.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.986
What does the FBI know about me?

19:48.988 --> 19:51.188
About my organization?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.656
What do you know about our microchip?

19:57.329 --> 19:59.897
I know you're gonna kill me,
so just do it already.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.232
I don't want to kill you.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.667
I want answers.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.203
And I'm gonna get 'em.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.574
Even if I have to do
this a thousand times.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.148
I'm gonna show you a series of photos.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.650
I need you to tell me if you recognize

20:19.652 --> 20:21.218
any of the individuals.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.253
Do you understand?

20:23.255 --> 20:25.022
Yes.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.924
Have you ever seen this woman?

20:33.265 --> 20:35.299
I don't know.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.902
What about this woman?

20:38.904 --> 20:42.105
What does the FBI know about Phase Two?!

20:42.107 --> 20:44.608
Everything.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.043
I know what you're doing.

20:46.045 --> 20:50.347
<i>I'm answering you. We know everything!</i>

20:52.685 --> 20:54.184
Have you ever seen her?

20:54.186 --> 20:56.353
No.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.255
I don't think so...

20:59.992 --> 21:01.925
I don't know.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.863
Do you recognize this man?

21:23.349 --> 21:24.815
Yes, I do.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.516
I recognize him.

21:26.518 --> 21:28.218
Do you know where he is?

21:28.220 --> 21:29.586
Yeah, I...

21:29.588 --> 21:32.322
It's okay, even the
smallest memory can...

21:35.928 --> 21:38.262
It's okay. I'll be right back.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.202
You think you can type with nine fingers?

21:45.204 --> 21:46.336
No, enough.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.005
Hey...

21:50.542 --> 21:53.610
Remember why we're here.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.280
What this is all for.

21:58.076 --> 21:59.783
I know this is hard.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.152
But we're saving this country.

22:05.102 --> 22:06.568
What is it?

22:06.593 --> 22:08.527
Mitch is dead. We lost Roman.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.535
Hey. Why'd you leave?

22:18.537 --> 22:21.041
We were making progress.
He recognized Borden.

22:21.066 --> 22:22.172
Roman is lying.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.408
What? No, why would he...

22:24.410 --> 22:27.244
The MRI detected it instantly.

22:27.246 --> 22:30.247
Look, he only lied
because he wants to help.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.891
He has good intentions.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.884
But good intentions are
not gonna find Patterson.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.252
Yeah, but they're a start,
and maybe if we...

22:35.254 --> 22:36.586
Maybe if you hadn't ZIP-ed him,

22:36.588 --> 22:38.359
we would've had a chance at finding her.

22:39.658 --> 22:40.857
Tasha's got something.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.492
She's in Patterson's lab.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.701
Don't beat yourself up, Jane.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.036
She's frustrated. We all are.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.005
We're going to find Patterson.

23:08.669 --> 23:10.435
What do you got?

23:10.460 --> 23:12.808
I got into one of the
Sandstorm operative's phones.

23:12.810 --> 23:15.410
Okay, this guy right here,

23:15.412 --> 23:17.179
the one Roman "forked"...

23:17.181 --> 23:20.182
he texted Borden and 15
others late last night.

23:20.184 --> 23:22.017
But the message...

23:22.019 --> 23:23.619
it just looks like spam.

23:23.621 --> 23:25.087
It's in some kind of code.

23:25.089 --> 23:26.421
I tried running it against
Patterson's system,

23:26.423 --> 23:28.257
but I got nowhere.

23:28.259 --> 23:29.825
So I'd really love your help.

23:29.827 --> 23:32.995
I'll, I'll try my code
breaking program.

23:32.997 --> 23:34.429
Knowing Sandstorm,

23:34.431 --> 23:36.198
I doubt it'll be a
straightforward encryption.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.867
A message of this size
could take weeks to crack,

23:38.869 --> 23:40.168
and if it needs an outside key,

23:40.170 --> 23:42.170
well, be more or less impossible.

23:44.041 --> 23:46.041
Hang on a minute,
where was that book found?

23:46.043 --> 23:47.876
Borden's apartment.

23:47.878 --> 23:49.177
Can you zoom in on that?

23:51.248 --> 23:53.482
<i>That's book one of Livy's
"Ab Urbe Condita."</i>

23:53.484 --> 23:56.752
Jane said that she'd seen
it in Shepherd's office.

23:56.754 --> 23:59.755
Sorry, Jane was reporting
Shepherd's reading habits?

23:59.757 --> 24:01.156
Yeah, I insisted on knowing

24:01.158 --> 24:02.724
all the details about the compound.

24:02.726 --> 24:04.059
It's a long shot, but...

24:04.061 --> 24:06.028
this could decrypt with the book cipher.

24:06.985 --> 24:08.730
Can you pull up the text from book one?

24:08.732 --> 24:09.907
Just did.

24:09.932 --> 24:11.196
Okay, wait.

24:11.221 --> 24:13.268
If we convert the entire
message to numbers,

24:13.270 --> 24:15.637
then have the computer
scan the correlating pages

24:15.639 --> 24:17.495
looking for any coherent combination of...

24:17.520 --> 24:18.920
It worked!

24:18.945 --> 24:21.979
Got it, 465 Willets
Point Boulevard, Queens.

24:23.241 --> 24:26.715
It's an auto shop that
belongs to a woman named...

24:26.717 --> 24:27.916
Charly Evon.

24:27.918 --> 24:29.852
Right, let's bring her in.

24:34.786 --> 24:37.420
Ms. Kamal, I need to speak with you.

24:37.445 --> 24:39.111
Now's really not a good time.

24:39.136 --> 24:40.496
The joint-task force

24:40.498 --> 24:42.431
between the FBI and Zero Division

24:42.433 --> 24:43.899
is officially disbanded.

24:43.901 --> 24:45.267
Effectively immediately.

24:45.269 --> 24:46.402
What?

24:46.404 --> 24:47.714
- You can't do that.
- I can.

24:47.739 --> 24:49.305
And I have.

24:49.307 --> 24:50.706
You need to go with these agents.

24:50.708 --> 24:51.907
You no longer work here.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.609
She's not going anywhere.

24:53.611 --> 24:55.544
Yesterday was the single biggest disaster

24:55.546 --> 24:57.546
the FBI has had in decades.

24:57.548 --> 24:59.715
You understand that, right?

25:00.985 --> 25:03.752
Take down Sandstorm.

25:03.754 --> 25:05.120
You failed.

25:05.122 --> 25:08.490
Instead, you led a dozen
agents to their death.

25:08.492 --> 25:10.325
That is not her fault.

25:10.327 --> 25:11.927
Whose fault is it?

25:11.929 --> 25:13.862
I am just as responsible
for yesterday as she is.

25:13.864 --> 25:15.864
I know that.

25:15.866 --> 25:19.335
Just consider yourself lucky
you didn't lead that raid.

25:21.539 --> 25:23.939
You need to leave the building now.

25:23.941 --> 25:25.007
Understood.

25:26.877 --> 25:28.510
Nas. Nas...

25:28.512 --> 25:31.680
I will do whatever it takes
to get you reinstated.

25:31.682 --> 25:33.048
I'll talk to the head of the NSA.

25:33.050 --> 25:34.683
Yeah, and they'll deny
any knowledge of me

25:34.685 --> 25:36.351
and Zero Division.

25:36.353 --> 25:38.720
Just... just go find Patterson, okay?

25:53.360 --> 25:54.770
What do you know about...

25:54.772 --> 25:56.371
Shut up!

25:58.476 --> 26:00.676
Are you slow or something?

26:00.678 --> 26:01.944
I think I made it pretty clear

26:01.946 --> 26:04.746
I'm not answering any of your questions.

26:04.748 --> 26:06.782
I'm loyal...

26:06.784 --> 26:08.584
unlike your children.

26:08.586 --> 26:10.319
First, Jane turned on you,

26:10.321 --> 26:12.187
and now it sounds like Roman did, too.

26:12.189 --> 26:13.522
So what makes you think.

26:13.524 --> 26:14.823
Borden's gonna be any different?

26:14.825 --> 26:17.926
Or any of your other "followers"?

26:17.928 --> 26:20.863
Everyone... will leave you!

26:21.799 --> 26:23.026
Because you're...

26:27.926 --> 26:29.293
Where is he?

26:29.318 --> 26:31.107
I don't know, I never seen him.

26:31.109 --> 26:32.729
Then why did we find his car at your shop?

26:32.753 --> 26:34.320
I don't know.

26:34.345 --> 26:35.644
I'll tell you what we know.

26:35.646 --> 26:36.879
You own an auto shop

26:36.881 --> 26:38.380
that barely makes enough
to keep the lights on.

26:38.382 --> 26:39.815
And you're a member

26:39.817 --> 26:41.984
of a very dangerous
terrorist organization.

26:41.986 --> 26:43.352
No! No, I'm not.

26:43.354 --> 26:44.786
A federal agent is missing.

26:44.788 --> 26:46.388
So either tell us where he is

26:46.390 --> 26:48.957
or spend the rest of your life in a hole.

26:50.961 --> 26:52.794
I provide getaway cars.

26:52.796 --> 26:54.229
That's it.

26:54.231 --> 26:55.264
I am not a terrorist.

26:55.266 --> 26:56.565
Did you give him a car?

26:56.567 --> 26:58.834
Yeah... he came in last night.

26:58.836 --> 27:00.769
Make, model, plates... now.

27:00.771 --> 27:03.172
I gave him a 2012 Toyota Corolla.

27:03.174 --> 27:05.424
A white one. I don't know the plates.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.653
You know what? I think
we should take her to Gitmo.

27:07.678 --> 27:08.777
Let them take care of her.

27:08.779 --> 27:10.245
I'm telling you I don't know the plates.

27:10.247 --> 27:12.181
Every month I get
these unmarked packages.

27:12.183 --> 27:13.582
I just put 'em in the cars.

27:13.584 --> 27:15.651
The drivers pick their plates.

27:15.653 --> 27:17.786
Does the car have any
distinctive markings?

27:17.788 --> 27:18.987
It was a regular car.

27:18.989 --> 27:20.989
Swapped parts? Anything?

27:23.194 --> 27:24.793
I think the front passenger door

27:24.795 --> 27:26.628
might have had its original paint.

27:26.630 --> 27:28.630
A gold color.

27:28.632 --> 27:30.712
Run it through Patterson's
vehicle tracking software.

27:36.874 --> 27:39.508
We have no choice but to kill her.

27:39.510 --> 27:40.876
No, I can get the information out of her.

27:40.878 --> 27:42.477
- Let me try to...
- It's decided!

27:42.479 --> 27:44.446
She's made it very clear
that she won't cooperate.

27:44.448 --> 27:47.616
And even if she did,
I could never trust her intel.

27:47.618 --> 27:49.451
I want to be the one to do it.

27:49.453 --> 27:51.286
It needs to be humane.

27:51.288 --> 27:52.987
I don't think your up to it.

27:53.824 --> 27:56.758
Please, let me do this.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.395
Fine. Then meet me back at the bunker.

28:07.271 --> 28:10.472
I found the car... A 2012 white Corolla

28:10.474 --> 28:12.641
with a front passenger door
in its original gold paint

28:12.643 --> 28:14.443
was picked up on a
traffic cam on the Hutch.

28:14.445 --> 28:16.078
The car drove into but not out of.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.880
Ward Acres Nature Preserve.

28:17.882 --> 28:19.951
Nice work. Let's move.

28:23.754 --> 28:25.721
Don't do this.

28:25.723 --> 28:28.090
You won't feel anything, I promise.

28:28.092 --> 28:31.627
Please... please, don't.

28:31.629 --> 28:33.162
I'll begin with a saline drip

28:33.164 --> 28:35.097
to ensure that your
IV is working properly.

28:35.099 --> 28:37.299
Next, I'll administer propofol,

28:37.301 --> 28:38.934
which will render you unconscious.

28:38.936 --> 28:40.825
I know that you
don't want to do this!

28:40.850 --> 28:42.583
What I want doesn't matter.

28:43.482 --> 28:45.048
I am so sorry.

28:56.011 --> 28:58.779
This isn't who you are.
You're not a killer.

28:58.781 --> 29:00.580
You don't know anything about me.

29:00.582 --> 29:03.216
I know you.

29:03.218 --> 29:05.752
You... you made me breakfast
in bed, and... and...

29:05.754 --> 29:07.387
You didn't need to do that.

29:07.389 --> 29:08.855
You wanted to.

29:08.857 --> 29:11.358
I think that you care about me.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.527
That's why you couldn't kill me before

29:13.529 --> 29:14.962
and why you can't do it now.

29:14.964 --> 29:16.763
Stop talking!

29:16.765 --> 29:20.267
Do this... and you will
become everything you hate.

29:20.269 --> 29:22.135
I don't have a choice.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.404
Yes... you do.

29:24.406 --> 29:28.575
Just like the people who
killed your wife had a choice.

29:28.577 --> 29:31.211
Just think about her, okay?

29:31.213 --> 29:33.280
What would she want?

29:34.883 --> 29:37.884
You told me that she saved
so many people's lives.

29:37.886 --> 29:39.987
Now, you can save mine.

29:39.989 --> 29:41.788
You loved her.

29:41.790 --> 29:44.524
And I know a part you loves me, too.

29:50.399 --> 29:51.631
You're right.

29:54.570 --> 29:56.236
Is that Shepherd?

29:58.240 --> 29:59.873
Is she back?

30:02.011 --> 30:03.510
That's his car.

30:03.512 --> 30:04.512
Where's Patterson?

30:25.667 --> 30:27.567
Good-bye, Patterson.

30:36.645 --> 30:38.645
Jane! Jane!

30:38.647 --> 30:41.448
- Are you okay?
- Weller! Help me get her out.

30:42.451 --> 30:43.483
Weller!

30:43.485 --> 30:45.652
Her foot's trapped!

30:49.889 --> 30:51.458
Weller, he's getting away.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.460
No, he's not. I'll get him.

30:53.462 --> 30:55.362
You two get Patterson!

31:03.572 --> 31:05.305
Patterson?

31:05.307 --> 31:07.120
Here!

31:07.145 --> 31:08.575
You're okay. We're here now.

31:08.577 --> 31:09.843
Let's get you out of here.

31:11.074 --> 31:12.412
Take it easy.

31:12.414 --> 31:13.847
There you go.

31:13.849 --> 31:15.615
Okay, you're okay.

31:56.558 --> 31:58.458
You can't shoot me, can you?

32:00.262 --> 32:01.628
Not yet.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.006
Why does Shepherd need me alive?

32:07.169 --> 32:08.869
Why?!

32:14.570 --> 32:15.975
This is Michael Feher.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.211
30 years with the Bureau.

32:18.213 --> 32:19.846
This morning, his body was found

32:19.848 --> 32:21.681
under a pile of rubble.

32:22.966 --> 32:25.552
Michael's daughter was
supposed to get married

32:25.554 --> 32:26.853
this Sunday.

32:26.855 --> 32:28.855
You killed him.

32:30.025 --> 32:32.659
No... I didn't do that.

32:32.661 --> 32:34.961
I don't even know who that man is.

32:34.963 --> 32:37.297
How can you know what you
have or have not done?

32:37.299 --> 32:39.632
I thought you couldn't remember anything.

32:39.634 --> 32:43.603
Unless, of course... you do remember.

32:43.605 --> 32:45.739
I don't!

32:47.442 --> 32:49.642
I don't know who I am.

32:49.644 --> 32:51.444
I don't know what I've done.

32:51.446 --> 32:53.646
I don't know anything
about what you're saying.

32:53.648 --> 32:57.584
It's a lot to... process, I'm sure.

32:57.586 --> 33:02.122
See, I feel it's my
duty to tell you the truth

33:02.124 --> 33:03.656
about who you are.

33:03.658 --> 33:05.625
Some people here,
they might have treated you

33:05.627 --> 33:08.928
like a victim or... like an asset.

33:08.930 --> 33:11.464
But you're neither.

33:11.466 --> 33:13.099
You're the enemy.

33:16.838 --> 33:18.805
Lawrence Manning.

33:18.807 --> 33:20.607
Nicollette Brown.

33:20.609 --> 33:23.042
Kevyn Sierra.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.677
Maria Vanlenz.

33:24.679 --> 33:27.781
The list goes on... and on.

33:27.783 --> 33:30.483
Innocent men and women.

33:30.485 --> 33:32.352
It's not about what you remember.

33:32.354 --> 33:34.687
It's about what you did.

33:34.689 --> 33:36.823
These deaths...

33:37.951 --> 33:40.026
that's who you are.

33:47.969 --> 33:49.903
You're gonna go with these agents.

33:49.905 --> 33:52.572
And you're gonna
answer all their questions.

33:52.574 --> 33:54.674
Where will they take me?

33:55.610 --> 33:58.378
Somewhere... safe.

34:04.968 --> 34:06.369
No, no, no. Please, please, stop!

34:06.394 --> 34:08.610
- Just let go of me!
- What's going on?

34:08.636 --> 34:10.688
I'm turning Roman over to the CIA

34:10.714 --> 34:12.179
to be properly interrogated.

34:12.205 --> 34:13.583
No, you're not.

34:13.585 --> 34:14.885
You have no right to.

34:14.887 --> 34:17.621
Actually, it's Roman who has no rights.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.224
Do you have any idea
what they'll do to him?

34:22.495 --> 34:23.994
They will torture him day in and day out,

34:23.996 --> 34:25.529
just like they did to me.

34:25.531 --> 34:29.366
This is why Roman needs to
be interrogated elsewhere.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.813
She has no objectivity...

34:30.838 --> 34:32.902
All right, you hand him over to the CIA,

34:32.905 --> 34:35.106
you lose me.

34:35.108 --> 34:36.639
Excuse me?

34:36.641 --> 34:38.242
I'll walk.

34:38.244 --> 34:41.712
He stays, Nas comes back, or...

34:41.714 --> 34:44.114
you can find yourself a
new Assistant Director.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.717
May I have a word?

34:48.154 --> 34:50.321
Roman, it's okay.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.022
What the hell has gotten into you?

34:52.024 --> 34:54.492
I can interrogate Roman and
get information out of him.

34:54.494 --> 34:55.760
So can the CIA.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.094
They don't have Nas.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.430
<i>- You don't have Nas.
- We need her here.</i>

34:59.432 --> 35:01.532
No one else knows Sandstorm
better than she does.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.067
I can't do this without her.

35:03.069 --> 35:05.402
- Kurt...
- Shepherd is planning something big.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.538
Something that Roman knows about.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.573
Nas and I can get him to talk.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.108
We can can capitalize on
his connection to Jane.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.010
Look at them.

35:13.012 --> 35:15.513
<i>That is how we get Shepherd.</i>

35:15.515 --> 35:18.149
<i>That is how we bring down Sandstorm.</i>

35:18.151 --> 35:22.458
You really want all of
this on your shoulders?

35:27.459 --> 35:28.858
Release him.

35:29.936 --> 35:32.189
You get intel from him,

35:32.191 --> 35:33.324
or he's gone,

35:33.326 --> 35:35.226
and if Nas makes a single misstep,

35:35.228 --> 35:37.395
I don't care if it's a clerical error,

35:37.397 --> 35:40.164
she's out, and you take the fall.

35:40.166 --> 35:42.166
This goes sideways...

35:42.168 --> 35:43.768
it's all on you.

35:50.343 --> 35:52.743
You should put your leg up.

35:52.745 --> 35:54.078
You need to quit fussing over me.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.046
I'm okay.

35:55.048 --> 35:58.209
Hey, macho man... put your leg up.

35:58.234 --> 35:59.754
You would have made a hell of a nurse.

36:02.639 --> 36:04.038
You hungry?

36:04.040 --> 36:05.406
I can make my own Cup o' Noodles.

36:05.408 --> 36:06.507
Okay.

36:06.509 --> 36:08.910
Will you just... Just relax.

36:08.912 --> 36:11.121
Put your leg up, please.

36:15.585 --> 36:16.951
What are you doing?

36:17.988 --> 36:19.387
What's it look like?

36:19.957 --> 36:21.657
You're my best friend.

36:21.659 --> 36:22.734
Exactly.

36:22.759 --> 36:24.426
You know me better than anyone else.

36:24.428 --> 36:27.296
It... it makes sense, Tasha.

36:30.109 --> 36:31.833
We're friends.

36:31.835 --> 36:32.968
That's all.

36:43.970 --> 36:45.870
I'm gonna go.

37:10.153 --> 37:11.686
I thought you might want a warm meal.

37:16.808 --> 37:17.972
Thank you.

37:19.350 --> 37:21.550
This is only temporary.

37:21.552 --> 37:23.285
I promise.

37:23.287 --> 37:25.259
I... I have something else for you.

37:34.798 --> 37:38.000
When did you, start to remember?

37:38.002 --> 37:40.335
Almost right away.

37:40.337 --> 37:42.037
The memories will come.

37:42.039 --> 37:44.295
I'm not sure I want them to.

37:46.244 --> 37:47.910
I know what that's like.

37:47.912 --> 37:50.379
I was so afraid of who I'd been

37:50.381 --> 37:51.914
and what I'd done.

37:51.916 --> 37:54.183
But even the most painful memories

37:54.185 --> 37:56.558
helped bring me to where I am now.

37:57.822 --> 37:59.956
And I'm going to be here.

37:59.958 --> 38:02.124
Okay?

38:02.126 --> 38:04.493
And I'm gonna help you
make sense of everything.

38:04.495 --> 38:08.764
And we are going to
figure this out together.

38:21.672 --> 38:23.204
I know, I know.

38:23.206 --> 38:24.339
I should be resting, but I...

38:24.341 --> 38:25.974
I'm not here to lecture you.

38:25.976 --> 38:28.410
What? No, just... You know what?

38:28.412 --> 38:31.513
Don't... don't repeat it, I get it.
Rest is important.

38:31.515 --> 38:33.281
I mean, I'm kind of
the queen of the all-nighter,

38:33.283 --> 38:35.750
but some people I know need their sleep.

38:35.752 --> 38:37.185
No.

38:38.822 --> 38:40.922
I came here...

38:40.924 --> 38:43.291
to give you these.

38:43.293 --> 38:44.993
They're from the team.

38:47.230 --> 38:49.016
Jaw is killing me.

38:51.068 --> 38:52.600
Thank you.

38:52.602 --> 38:54.703
If you hadn't found me...

38:54.705 --> 38:56.705
I was really scared.

38:56.730 --> 38:58.229
We all were.

39:00.277 --> 39:01.910
Okay, okay, okay.

39:01.912 --> 39:04.045
I want you to look at something.

39:04.047 --> 39:05.280
No.

39:05.282 --> 39:07.667
Tomorrow. Please.

39:07.692 --> 39:09.558
Just let me do this.

39:12.829 --> 39:14.195
Yes, ma'am.

39:15.292 --> 39:17.704
Okay.

39:19.908 --> 39:21.272
How did you find that?

39:21.274 --> 39:24.175
Borden, or, sorry, "Nigel"...

39:24.177 --> 39:27.311
Creeper name... Told me that his wife

39:27.313 --> 39:30.081
was killed in a hospital
that was newly constructed.

39:30.083 --> 39:33.250
I already had a time frame
off of Jane's Orion photo

39:33.252 --> 39:37.388
and a sense of region based
on his wife's wedding ring.

39:37.390 --> 39:39.590
So I cross-referenced all of that against

39:39.592 --> 39:42.359
hospital construction dates, and voila.

39:42.361 --> 39:44.428
Dr. Nigel Thornton.

39:44.430 --> 39:46.831
And he didn't even go to a
very good medical school.

39:50.369 --> 39:51.769
Nice work.

39:53.306 --> 39:55.840
Now... please get some sleep...

39:55.842 --> 39:57.274
No... I want to run with this.

39:57.276 --> 39:58.843
I want to dig a little deeper.

39:58.845 --> 40:00.244
I want to use the book code

40:00.246 --> 40:02.012
on everything in his
apartment, Post-its...

40:02.014 --> 40:03.414
How do you know about the book code?

40:03.416 --> 40:05.549
Come on, I read the notes.

40:05.551 --> 40:08.619
I mean, do you even know
what this could unlock?

40:10.089 --> 40:11.622
You're right.

40:19.157 --> 40:21.157
Patterson's back at the FBI.

40:21.159 --> 40:24.227
We need to alter our attack plan.

40:24.229 --> 40:26.963
Just in case Roman remembers anything.

40:26.965 --> 40:28.531
And what about Weller?

40:28.533 --> 40:29.866
That stays.

40:29.868 --> 40:32.235
He's still crucial to the end game.

40:48.186 --> 40:50.019
When were you
gonna tell me about this?

40:50.021 --> 40:52.055
I'm telling you now.

40:52.057 --> 40:54.958
Here, Nas had an
inside source at Sandstorm.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.728
What? How? Wh-Who? Or... of...

40:58.730 --> 41:00.725
All of the questions.

41:01.686 --> 41:04.192
He's been dark for a very long time.

41:04.194 --> 41:05.827
Nas doesn't even know his identity.

41:05.829 --> 41:08.130
- But he gave her his phone?
- Yeah.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.632
Nas and the team at the NSA
have been trying to unlock it,

41:10.634 --> 41:13.301
but nobody's been able to
get past that home screen.

41:13.303 --> 41:15.570
Okay, have they...

41:15.572 --> 41:17.072
tried the book code?

41:17.074 --> 41:19.174
No, not yet.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.709
Okay.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.377
I will convert the prompt

41:22.379 --> 41:24.679
to its numeric equivalent.

41:24.681 --> 41:28.794
<i>Pull up the old... "Ab Urbe Condita."</i>

41:30.621 --> 41:34.022
Okay, that looks
very not promising.

41:34.024 --> 41:35.457
Try it.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.901
Whoa.

41:45.903 --> 41:47.970
I didn't think that was
actually gonna... psh.

41:48.940 --> 41:50.272
Damn, I'm good.

41:50.274 --> 41:52.008
Yes, you are.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.743
What's that?

42:02.754 --> 42:04.754
It's a rough-draft Jane.

42:04.756 --> 42:05.847
<i>How does it look?</i>

42:05.872 --> 42:07.863
Sandstorm did a practice run.

42:09.394 --> 42:12.261
My God... look at her neck.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.429
It's an extra tattoo.

42:15.400 --> 42:19.035
Why the hell would
Sandstorm remove that one?

42:23.576 --> 42:27.709
