WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:11.049
Got a date with Allison.
I'm finding out what I can about her.

00:11.077 --> 00:12.454
Let it flow tonight.
Be you.

00:12.479 --> 00:13.651
She gonna find out
who you are eventually,

00:13.680 --> 00:14.988
and she'll either like it or she won't.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.551
You're exactly the kind of person
I should date,

00:16.583 --> 00:19.564
because I would try to date you
even if I was still in Dorchester

00:19.586 --> 00:21.588
with nothing to my name
except my name.

00:21.621 --> 00:23.623
You can say that,
but you can't know that.

00:23.656 --> 00:26.728
I represent Cam Calloway,
and he may be a pro basketball player,

00:26.760 --> 00:28.797
but we want him to be more
than just a basketball player.

00:28.828 --> 00:29.898
- Reggie Vaughn?
- Yes.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.603
Allow me to introduce myself.
Deshauwn May.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.578
- You should be my manager.
- You got a manager.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.103
Jupiter:
I got a problem and you know it.

00:36.136 --> 00:39.276
- Do you wanna manage Jupiter?
- I wanna do right by Cam.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.342
I'm already working
Ira, Coke, Bao.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.081
This'll just be another thing
that I'm working.

00:43.109 --> 00:46.318
Money doesn't make you somebody.
Being somebody makes you somebody.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.622
God has done you,
Cam, and me pretty good.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.355
What we do with the rest
is up to us.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.523
Reg, destiny's callin'.

00:58.124 --> 01:00.161
(cell phone vibrating)

01:08.435 --> 01:10.506
- This is Reggie.
- Clayton Beckwith here.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.483
- I'm so sorry to wake you.
- Clayton?

01:12.505 --> 01:14.382
Who? What? Where?

01:14.407 --> 01:17.513
Jupiter Blackmon was, uh,
picked up for shoplifting.

01:17.544 --> 01:20.184
- Shoplifting what?
- Marshmallows.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.887
Oh, for fuck sake.
Why?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.419
Well, apparently, he had
a hankering for some s'mores.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.932
He's accused of
attempting to procure them

01:27.954 --> 01:30.560
without providing the grocer
with sufficient legal tender.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.501
- Did he have any drugs on him?
- No.

01:32.525 --> 01:35.062
Thankfully his drugs
were already inside of him.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.702
But he hasn't taken a piss test yet,
and, uh, nobody knows anything.

01:38.731 --> 01:41.041
Okay, text me where you are.
I'm on my way.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.239
Don't let him piss in anything

01:42.268 --> 01:43.804
unless you're with him
and you can see it flush.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.443
Oh, I shall handle his dick
as if it were my own.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.977
Don't take that the wrong way.
I'm a happily married man.

01:50.009 --> 01:53.218
- (sighs)
- (music playing)

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.090 --> 02:07.663
- So do lady cops get high?
- Jupiter, I'm a big fan,

02:07.694 --> 02:10.139
but there are 14 cameras
watching us right now.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.234
That don't answer my question.
Do cops get high?

02:12.265 --> 02:14.768
And that was the moment
he stopped hitting on the sergeant.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.872
- (metal detector beeps)
- Good morning.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.541
Or should I say,
"Bad middle of the night"?

02:18.571 --> 02:20.244
Look, Reg, this was just
a misunderstanding

02:20.273 --> 02:22.753
- that will soon be understood.
- Stop talking. No more talking.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.413
Mr. Beckwith say
he gonna make this go away.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.549
- Stop talking now.
- He kept his mouth shut

02:26.579 --> 02:27.956
when it was important.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.519
I told Jupiter my number in his phone
wasn't just for the bad times.

02:31.551 --> 02:34.293
I can't remember the last time
someone called me just to say,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.823
"Hello, how you doin'?"
I'd like that.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.860
- Hey, I'm gonna do that.
- Any time after 8:00.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.271
This'll all be handled very discreetly.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.434
- When you say "handled"...
- Yes?

02:44.464 --> 02:47.035
- How?
- Telling you how I handle things

02:47.066 --> 02:49.603
would render me indiscreet.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.617
- He's gonna keep us all real busy.
- Thank you, Clayton.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.245
Don't be alarmed
by the size of my invoice.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.881
(music playing)

03:00.146 --> 03:03.150
- Allison: Hey.
- Hey, girl.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.322
Just thinking about you as usual.
Where you at?

03:05.351 --> 03:07.456
I was off to work
when my car broke down,

03:07.487 --> 03:10.900
so now I'm at my mechanic's, a man
I'm seeing much too much of lately.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.495
- Why didn't you call me?
- I'm focused on my car.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.836
- But I can help.
- What do you know about timing belts?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.206
- Nothing, but I could've got you.
- You're busy.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.871
- I'm never too busy for you.
- I'll remind you of that

03:20.900 --> 03:22.174
when I call you in
the middle of a game.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.614
- I'll come at halftime.
- What if you're out of town?

03:24.637 --> 03:27.641
- I'll fly out during halftime.
- Okay, what if you get suspended?

03:27.674 --> 03:30.245
- Chivalry is expensive.
- (both chuckle)

03:30.276 --> 03:32.779
Please.
I've got AAA and they're on it.

03:32.812 --> 03:35.190
- What's wrong with the car?
- It's a piece of shit.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.662
- (chuckles) It's a piece of shit?
Yes, it's a piece of shit.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.097
Well, you wanna borrow one of mine?
I got three.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.999
It's just a timing belt.
They'll fix it and I'll be good to go.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.526
- Well, can I take you to lunch?
- That sounds nice,

03:46.559 --> 03:48.596
but I'll probably have to
work through lunch.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.733
People should not have to
work through lunch.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.107
When they don't show up until lunch,
they should.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.043
Fine. Look,
I will bring you some lunch,

03:55.068 --> 03:57.173
watch you eat it while you work,
then I'll wait in the parking lot

03:57.203 --> 04:00.150
- and take you to dinner.
- I like your style, Calloway.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.154
But let me just hit you back once I get
to work and we'll see how things go.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.213
All right.
Call me if you need me.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.724
- I mean, I got the day off.
- Apparently.

04:06.746 --> 04:10.023
- I wish you had the day off, too.
- Some things are beyond our control.

04:10.049 --> 04:12.859
- Ah, I hate that.
- Most people do.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.455
- Gotta go.
- Let's make out later.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.660
- As long as you floss.
- (chuckles)

04:19.325 --> 04:22.465
(sighs)
I am in seventh grade.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.310
Not gonna ask
what you were thinking, Jupiter,

04:26.332 --> 04:28.243
because I'm beginning to realize
that thinking for you

04:28.268 --> 04:30.214
- is like a hibernation mode.
- Thank you.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.613
- Not a compliment.
- All's good.

04:31.638 --> 04:34.050
- Look, don't go all angry face.
- My face is gonna do

04:34.073 --> 04:36.075
what my face does as long as
you keep doing what you do.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.180
- You stole a bag of marshmallows?
- I didn't steal 'em.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.020
- I just walked out with 'em.
- Wow.

04:40.046 --> 04:42.322
Now I'm amused.
Please, elaborate.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.487
I didn't get a cart
'cause I wasn't doing a big shop.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.724
But it takes a few things to make
a s'mores... chocolate, crackers...

04:46.753 --> 04:48.426
I didn't wanna juggle all that,

04:48.454 --> 04:50.365
so I put the marshmallows
in my hoodie pocket,

04:50.390 --> 04:53.496
- but then I realized I had no money.
- Elaborate quicker.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.972
So I made the choice
to get some money,

04:55.995 --> 04:57.497
but I forgot to take the marshmallows
out of my hoodie pocket.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.101
See, these hoodie pockets is real deep,
and next thing you know,

05:00.133 --> 05:01.874
I'm standing outside
with something I didn't paid for.

05:01.901 --> 05:04.040
Jupiter, that's called stealing.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.050
No... see, now, I was high as fuck.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.746
- It was drug-induced negligence.
- Right. That's better.

05:08.775 --> 05:11.085
Come on, man.
I didn't get charged with stealing.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.454
- I was charged with shoplifting.
- That's because what you stole

05:13.479 --> 05:15.152
was so fuckin' stupid to have stolen,

05:15.181 --> 05:17.183
they don't even dignify it
with the word "stealing."

05:17.216 --> 05:19.127
All right, what can I say, chewing
marshmallows makes me happy.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.325
My mouth gets to do this
fun little floaty thing, and it...

05:21.354 --> 05:24.767
- You're like a fuckin' child.
- Man, why you gotta be like this?

05:24.791 --> 05:26.668
Because this is
what a good manager is like.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.639
Like this when situations
like this go down.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.972
Like this when things like this
bounce me outta bed to bail you out.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.944
- You know, you're makin' me feel bad.
- Good!

05:33.966 --> 05:36.640
It is my intention
to make you feel bad right now.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.307
Hey, is your corner boy Deshauwn

05:38.338 --> 05:40.045
slangin' any common sense
growth hormone?

05:40.073 --> 05:43.054
Because you will need to speed up
the maturation process before the draft,

05:43.076 --> 05:44.419
otherwise you won't get drafted.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.754
Or worse,
you'll get drafted by the Raiders.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.816
But why you so mad?
It's not like I stole 'em from you.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.953
So you're admitting now
that you did, in fact, steal?

05:50.983 --> 05:52.394
They were marshmallows!

05:52.418 --> 05:54.091
- Beckwith's gonna make this go away.
- No, no, no.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.997
You are out of "make it go aways."

05:56.022 --> 05:59.231
All you have left is "control the damage
and make it hurt less."

05:59.258 --> 06:02.137
Jupiter, I'm taking you home, and you're
not to say anything to anybody

06:02.161 --> 06:04.163
until I tell you what to say,
when to say it,

06:04.197 --> 06:05.972
and what the sentence construction is.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.739
- But I got a class.
- Jupiter...

06:07.767 --> 06:09.872
Remember, you said it was important
to keep up appearances

06:09.902 --> 06:12.212
till before the draft and that if
I stay in school and get my degree,

06:12.238 --> 06:13.581
my endorsement money
will increase because

06:13.606 --> 06:16.519
"most Americans love nothing more than
an educated, nonthreatening black man"?

06:16.542 --> 06:18.988
Jupiter, you are
in control of your life.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.820
Nobody else.
You understand me?

06:20.847 --> 06:24.158
Class, then home.
But first, car, seat belt, and shut up.

06:24.183 --> 06:27.130
(music playing)

06:36.629 --> 06:39.109
- Uncle J, you ever been in love?
- Say what?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.635
- You ever been in love?
- Don't ask me that.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.305
- Why?
- Don't ask me why.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.009
- Why not?
- Don't ask me why not.

06:45.037 --> 06:46.482
- How come?
- Because.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.986
- Because why?
- Because it's my personal business.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.420
- We're family.
- That's all the more reason

06:51.444 --> 06:53.924
- not to ask why.
- Ma, how the hell do you not know

06:53.946 --> 06:56.586
- if your brother's ever been in love?
- He didn't just get this way.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.823
He's always been this way... private.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.525
I like it when we don't talk about
nothin' important. Just laugh.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.000
It's always trouble
when we gather in the living room.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.468
M-Chuck:
Okay, so wait a minute, Unc.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.732
You're saying that love is important.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.569
So you were in love once.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.303
- I told you, don't ask me that.
- Okay, fine.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.311
I won't ask about love,
but is it fair to ask

07:14.333 --> 07:16.313
if you had a romantic past
when you were my age?

07:16.335 --> 07:19.908
Nephew, when I was your age,
I fucked a whole busload of bitches.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.111
- (laughing)
- And I ain't talking about

07:21.140 --> 07:22.551
that little short school bus
of bitches,

07:22.575 --> 07:26.022
I'm talking about that double-decker
English bus full of bitches.

07:26.045 --> 07:30.255
- Man, my friends loved your uncle.
- Sure did.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.856
Go, young Unc!
Retroactive props, man!

07:33.886 --> 07:36.389
Yeah.
You still fuckin' following me.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.424
We're not talking
notches or numbers, Unc.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.369
We're talking love.
Real love.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.703
Look, I told you
don't ask me about that.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.639
He really likes this Allison girl,

07:44.664 --> 07:46.905
and he's never been in love,
so he doesn't know if he is.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.743
And we can't tell him
what a man feels when he's in love,

07:49.769 --> 07:53.376
- so he needs a man's perspective.
- Uncle J, hypothetically...

07:53.406 --> 07:55.044
I mean, if was gonna know
I was in love,

07:55.074 --> 07:57.179
how would I go about finding
the answer to that question?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.245
Like, the true answer?

07:58.277 --> 08:00.314
Have you ever
put your face in her ass?

08:00.346 --> 08:03.452
- 'Cause that's a good indicator.
- No, I mean, I like her ass.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.962
I'm talking about
the whole girl, man.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.691
If you a man over the age of 12

08:06.719 --> 08:08.824
and you asking another man
over the age of 12

08:08.855 --> 08:11.233
if he's been in love,
then you in love.

08:14.393 --> 08:17.237
I'm getting up. Don't follow me.
Good-bye.

08:19.131 --> 08:20.804
(all chuckle)

08:20.833 --> 08:23.211
(music playing)

08:31.711 --> 08:34.123
(grunting)

08:36.182 --> 08:39.129
Coffee?

08:39.150 --> 08:41.825
Jupiter got picked up
for shoplifting, Missy.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.892
- (sighs) Beckwith take care of it?
- This time.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.164
But there will be a next time.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.570
Hell, next time could be
very well happening right now.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.938
Well, most professional athletes

08:50.963 --> 08:53.944
- are spoiled, emotional degenerates.
- Not Cam.

08:53.966 --> 08:57.106
The reason Cam isn't is you.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.707
Your involvement in his life,
your counsel to him.

08:59.739 --> 09:03.744
You, Reggie Vaughn, are the exception
to the pro athlete degenerate rule.

09:03.776 --> 09:07.121
Jupiter is a rolling state
of emergency, Missy.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.023
- He just needs more of you...
- No, Missy.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.959
...to make sure
his tinderbox stays bare.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.826
It may be beyond my power.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.593
Now, now.
Buck up, son.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.760
The phrase "putting out fires"
was not created in a vacuum.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.202
It comes from good guys like you

09:20.226 --> 09:22.968
rolling behind the states of emergency
with your fire truck.

09:22.995 --> 09:26.909
Jupiter ain't no tinderbox.
He is a fuckin' inferno.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.675
Like those flames that come out of
the smokestacks in New Jersey.

09:29.702 --> 09:32.376
An inferno with an endless,
renewable supply

09:32.405 --> 09:34.612
of kindling and gasoline
that makes the drive

09:34.640 --> 09:37.280
from Manhattan to Newark Airport
smell like the colon

09:37.310 --> 09:38.789
of the asshole of the Earth.

09:38.811 --> 09:43.351
And it convinces you that God is dead
and that the devil is in charge.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.191
Doughnut?

09:46.352 --> 09:48.059
I should have never taken him on.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.091
- You're making an impact.
- Mm-mm. It's the other way around.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.626
He crash-landed on me,
and now I gotta fix it.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.572
Excuse me.
(grunts)

10:02.401 --> 10:04.677
- (music playing)
- ♪ Okay, okay ♪

10:04.704 --> 10:06.047
- ♪ Yeah ♪
- ♪ Okay, okay ♪

10:06.072 --> 10:07.210
♪ Yo... ♪

10:07.239 --> 10:10.686
I heard you girls were so hot,
you need to be hosed down.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.919
- (screaming)
- (laughing)

10:13.946 --> 10:16.483
My eyes! It's in my eyes!

10:16.515 --> 10:19.394
- Get that motherfucker!
- Oh, shit!

10:19.418 --> 10:21.591
Go, go, go!
Get the-- oh, fuck!

10:21.621 --> 10:23.032
- (cell phone vibrating)
- Missy: No, I don't.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.092
- We haven't skinny-dipped.
- (chuckles)

10:31.731 --> 10:32.732
Yo.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.769
Yo, Reggie, I'm at the dean's office.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.177
I was, um...

10:40.206 --> 10:43.210
I was wondering if you could...
if you'd come talk to her with me.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.518
- You make the honor roll?
- I did not.

10:45.544 --> 10:48.753
- But can you come down?
- Text me the details.

10:48.781 --> 10:52.558
(sighs)
All right.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.225
Dean Sanborn,
that is a lovely color on your skin.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.427
Don't let nobody
tell you no different.

10:57.456 --> 10:59.493
(gunfire)

11:08.300 --> 11:10.712
Beckwith says he spoke to the grocer.

11:10.736 --> 11:13.216
Grocer's gonna say
it's a misunderstanding.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.413
- It's going away.
- How much Beckwith pay the grocer?

11:16.442 --> 11:19.048
Put it this way-- he ain't gotta
groce too hard from now on.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.684
- Fuck.
- And I just left the dean's office

11:21.714 --> 11:23.421
because he got in trouble again.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.622
But I got it under control.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.631
- You sure?
- Nope.

11:31.090 --> 11:34.765
- Well, why you saying it?
- Because I promised you that I would.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.707
And I have to and I will.
I just gotta...

11:37.730 --> 11:39.266
gotta make sure
this guy's fuck-ups

11:39.298 --> 11:41.642
don't blend your name
with the stupid shit he does.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.907
My name can handle it.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.937
My name's handled
plenty of bad press all year.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.415
Don't worry about that.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.112
It's the only thing
I'm worried about right now.

11:48.140 --> 11:52.247
I mean, you know, honestly, dude,
I think I overstepped.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.259
You know, I... I picked the wrong guy
for us to represent, man.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.319
I-I drug you into a situation that--
that I shouldn't have.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.762
- I mean... Fuck.
- Wait.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.164
"Drug" is a word?
Like, a real word?

12:03.189 --> 12:06.432
- Like, the past tense of "drag"?
- I'm not really sure...

12:06.459 --> 12:08.496
M-Chuck was lighting me up about that,
saying that it wasn't.

12:08.527 --> 12:11.030
If a person uses a word
and you get what the word meant,

12:11.063 --> 12:12.770
- it's a word.
- Amen.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.506
Look, anyway, I drug you
into a management business

12:15.534 --> 12:17.707
reppin' a kid you should not
have your name associated with.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.684
I have a part to play
in your life, Cam,

12:20.706 --> 12:23.016
and with this shit,
I didn't play this part well.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.417
I'm sorry.
(sighs)

12:26.445 --> 12:29.324
I fucked up.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.886
- I've never heard you say that.
- It's been a goal of mine.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.364
(Cam chuckles)

12:36.622 --> 12:40.092
Dude, our bond is strong.

12:40.126 --> 12:43.630
The whole of what we do together
is greater than the sum of the parts.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.734
This part, maybe not so good,
but it wasn't disastrous.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.837
- Could've been.
- It coulda, woulda, shoulda.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.905
Shouldn'ta.
Could still be.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.684
Let's cut the bait on Jupiter,
send him back to Deshauwn.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.484
- You serious?
- We'll regroup.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.014
Do better with the next thing
that you fuck up.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.151
- Come on.
- Hey, man, I had to.

13:03.182 --> 13:06.561
But we're not giving up
on this management business.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.496
Just our first client.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.229
It was a good idea.
A great one.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.571
Ooh.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.575
My boy.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.373
All right, it is your shot.
Don't fuck it up.

13:23.402 --> 13:26.008
You know what? How 'bout
I fuck you up with this cue stick?

13:26.038 --> 13:27.711
- (laughing)
- And I'ma use this end.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.844
Fucker.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.753
(music playing)

13:31.777 --> 13:33.814
We need a big-ass bow.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.884
- You got a purple one?
- We can look.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.863
- At this price, you will find.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.161
Damn.
I mean, come on, man.

13:42.188 --> 13:44.099
- You think we stole the money?
- No, sir.

13:44.123 --> 13:47.229
Yeah, 'cause I can't believe
my nephew got all this money, either.

13:47.259 --> 13:51.264
We didn't steal it.
We did it the right way.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.369
- We sold drugs for it.
- All right, Unc, ease up on him.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.505
- Yes, we sold drugs all the time.
- (laughing)

13:58.771 --> 14:01.081
- And I know a cokehead when I see one.
- Oh, my...

14:01.106 --> 14:03.347
- And you are one.
- No.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.786
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No, no, no.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.222
Listen, does this look
real familiar to you?

14:07.246 --> 14:08.884
Bow...

14:08.914 --> 14:12.828
- bow-bow-bow... bow.
- Cam: Unc!

14:12.852 --> 14:15.628
Don't run the car
until you get the purple bow.

14:15.654 --> 14:17.793
(music playing)

14:21.093 --> 14:24.006
(Cam chuckling)
Keep your eyes closed.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.441
- Okay.
- All right, I got you something.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.309
- You couldn't give it to me inside?
- Uh, no.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.145
- It wouldn't fit through the door.
- What? What is it?

14:32.171 --> 14:35.380
Hang on, you'll see.
All right, open 'em.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.183
Yeah, girl!
How 'bout it?

14:38.210 --> 14:42.181
- You bought me a Jeep Cherokee?
- That is a Cadillac Escalade!

14:42.214 --> 14:44.751
- You bought me a Cadillac Escalade?
- Yes!

14:44.783 --> 14:49.061
- No more timing belt problems now.
- Wow! Oh, my God.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.261
- Do you like it?
- How could I not?

14:51.290 --> 14:53.031
- Do you love it?
- It's amazing.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.731
Look, I know I can't
park it here, all right.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.569
There's probably an ambulance
gonna come through here

14:56.595 --> 14:57.938
with some guy who's got
like 90 seconds to live,

14:57.963 --> 14:59.408
- so I'ma pull it right over here, okay?
- All right.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.638
Well, I'll tell everyone that I'll be
a minute, and then I'll meet you.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.146
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.975
Cam, this is very sweet.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.919
And very tricked out.
It's fully-loaded.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.479
Check out the interior.

15:12.511 --> 15:15.617
Cam, this car is worth more
than I make in a year.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.821
Yeah.
It's pretty dope, ain't it?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.693
You don't need to spend
your money on me.

15:19.718 --> 15:23.029
No, that's what the money is for-- to
make the people that I care about happy.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.865
And... yeah, you don't look happy.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.531
lam happy, and I'm so thankful.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.665
And this is such a nice gift.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.939
But I don't know how to say this
without sounding ungrateful...

15:33.966 --> 15:36.503
but I can't accept this car.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.913
Did you just say no to a car?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.079
You said you needed a car, right?

15:43.108 --> 15:44.883
Well, here it is,
bought and paid for.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.220
You said it yourself,
you can't control everything.

15:47.246 --> 15:50.989
- You cannot control what I buy you.
- Cam, it's very sweet.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.519
Then get in the car
and you'll see how sweet it is.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.533
Allison, okay,
I know it's a big statement.

15:56.555 --> 15:59.092
And I-l hear you about
the-- the salary thing.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.694
I'm not trying to big-time you here.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.967
I'm just trying to make you
a part of the big-time.

16:02.995 --> 16:06.272
Because it's fun, you know,
I can, and I like you.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.677
Like, I really like you.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.114
I like you, too.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.810
Gifts come to people, and you gotta
accept that you're worthy of a gift.

16:16.842 --> 16:18.583
You're not in charge of
how God answers prayers.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.489
- I'm just answering a prayer.
- Oh, so you're a messenger from God?

16:21.513 --> 16:23.857
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, I'm Cam.

16:23.882 --> 16:27.295
- Not to be confused with Gabriel.
- I can't.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.026
Come on, dude!

16:29.054 --> 16:30.829
What am I supposed to do with this?

16:30.856 --> 16:32.995
I already drove it off the lot.
It's already depreciated.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.232
- Isn't there a lemon law?
- For lemons.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.968
This isn't a lemon.
It's very clearly not a lemon.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.978
Cam, I know you don't understand,

16:47.006 --> 16:50.078
- but I'm sorry.
- (sighs)

16:50.109 --> 16:52.214
I'll tell you what I do understand.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.918
That not completely understanding
is a part of the spell.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.194
I can't believe
you turned down a car.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.631
No one in America
has ever turned down a car.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.327
Can I buy you a horse?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.358
Let's save a horse
before it goes to the glue factory.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.065
(Allison laughs)
We'll talk about it.

17:08.093 --> 17:10.368
Cassie:
So she turned down a free car?

17:10.396 --> 17:13.137
- M-Chuck: A free Escalade.
- That means she fuckin' someone else.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.339
- No, I just blew this one.
- Wait. She's a she-male?

17:16.367 --> 17:19.041
Not blown as in "blown,"
blown as ln "I messed up.

17:19.070 --> 17:22.280
I misevaluated, misgauged.
It was a mistake.

17:22.307 --> 17:26.983
- I'm telling you, this girl's different.
- By "different," you mean stupid?

17:27.012 --> 17:29.959
No, just not comfortable
with big gifts.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.859
Yeah, well, I am.
This here's mine.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.296
How many trucks you need,
greedy-ass motherfucker?

17:34.319 --> 17:35.662
Yeah, we're sharing this.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.598
You know, I think I just
came on too strong.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.160
Look, I told you, man,
love'll fuck you up.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.968
A woman don't know what to do
with a man when he loves her full-on.

17:42.995 --> 17:46.374
- Well, you didn't tell me that.
- I did... in between the lines.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.843
M-Chuck: How you gonna know
what her reaction would be?

17:47.866 --> 17:50.813
Most bitches would be humping you in
the back seat, hoping you knock 'em up.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.476
- Well, she didn't.
- 'Cause she's humpin' somebody else.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.143
Well, you did a nice thing, baby.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.176
And you don't have to
feel bad about it.

17:57.209 --> 18:00.816
I don't feel bad.
I just... you know, I like her.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.690
Well, you don't have to say it
with a car, just say it.

18:03.715 --> 18:06.093
Marry her
and the cars will come.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.064
And trust me,
she will not be turning 'em down.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.068
She'll be like, "Cameron,
when is the lease up on the Maybach?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.536
It's far too long
and it barely fits in the garage."

18:13.559 --> 18:14.902
- (Cam chuckles)
- Right?

18:16.361 --> 18:18.568
Oh, there she is.
Don't tell her I said that.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.372
(brakes squeak, engine rattling)

18:20.399 --> 18:22.504
(door squeaks)

18:22.534 --> 18:24.571
- Hi.
- Hey, Allison.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.344
I wanna thank you
for turning down that car.

18:26.371 --> 18:29.818
- I know, it seems ungrateful.
- Seems principled.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.584
- You're a principled girl.
- Ma, she's driving a death trap.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.386
- Mary Charles!
- It's the truth.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.552
- Come on, everybody knows it.
- Do you have to say every fuckin' thing

18:36.582 --> 18:38.391
- that comes to your lips?
- She says principled, I say stupid.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.522
- Shut up!
' Guys! Guys!

18:40.552 --> 18:42.429
I am sorry about them.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.593
Being with me means
being with them sometimes.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.126
(chuckles)
I can handle it.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.070
But look, I thought about it,

18:49.094 --> 18:51.131
and I understand
why you don't want the car as a gift,

18:51.163 --> 18:53.165
you know, given how little time
we've known each other.

18:53.198 --> 18:55.678
That was a little overeager on my part,
and I apologize.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.875
I mean, I apologize for giving you
a world-class vehicle.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.009
You don't have to apologize.

19:01.039 --> 19:04.043
Yeah, but I want you to know
that, um, knowing you--

19:04.076 --> 19:07.387
well, getting to know you has been the
best thing that's ever happened to me.

19:07.412 --> 19:08.948
There it is.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.961
Didn't you just become
a multimillionaire,

19:10.983 --> 19:12.485
like, six months ago?

19:12.518 --> 19:15.522
- Look at this place.
- I mean, I repeat that statement.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.295
Money don't buy happiness.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.700
Apparently, it can't even drive
the happiness to work.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.602
I mean, the happiness
is the happiness.

19:21.627 --> 19:22.799
I don't even know what I'm saying.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.570
I just like you for you,
and I want you to like me for me.

19:25.597 --> 19:27.577
But that's all I'm gonna say.
I'ma shut up.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.306
You are liked for you.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.814
You wanna go get
something to eat?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.249
I'm paying.
You can't not let me pay.

19:34.273 --> 19:37.413
Sure, but can you follow me
to my mechanic's first?

19:37.442 --> 19:38.512
He's gonna try to fix it

19:38.544 --> 19:40.046
- by the morning.
- Okay.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.819
Hey, you sure you don't want this car?

19:41.847 --> 19:44.020
Just a ride to my mechanic's garage.

19:44.049 --> 19:46.825
With all due respect,
take the car, bitch.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.456
My nephew's rich!

19:48.487 --> 19:50.967
Yeah, a car for a rich guy is like
a nice dinner for a normal guy.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.900
All right, all,
we gonna get some barbecue.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.598
First, we gotta drop off Allison's car.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.970
Are you sure you don't wanna drive
the Escalade just once?

19:56.995 --> 19:59.839
- No, I'll take my car.
- No, me and Uncle J will take your car.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.608
- You drive the gift not taken.
- Okay.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.417
Mm-mm-mm!

20:07.439 --> 20:09.942
Don't you let her outta your sight.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.579
- All right, Unc.
- Yeah.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.682
Have you hit that yet?

20:14.713 --> 20:16.784
(music playing)

20:18.050 --> 20:20.326
Man:
Go for it! Go for it!

20:20.352 --> 20:22.025
Man #2: Hey, don't let him
put that move on you!

20:22.054 --> 20:24.864
(overlapping chatter)

20:25.791 --> 20:27.702
- There we go.
- Deshauwn?

20:27.726 --> 20:30.172
Hey, stand down,
background dancers.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.505
- Fuck you doin'?
- Hands up, N-word!

20:32.531 --> 20:35.603
- Did you just say, "Hands up, N-word"?
- Yeah.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.477
- Yeah, yeah, I did.
- Why?

20:37.502 --> 20:39.778
I mean, not-not the "hands up" part,
but the "N-word" thing.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.910
Man, I'm tryin' to improve my language.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.749
N-word's a divisive word.

20:43.775 --> 20:46.483
- Read yourself some Ta-Nehisi Coates.
- Right on.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.821
N-word, the fuck you doin'?!

20:48.847 --> 20:51.555
- It just don't feel the same.
- Oh-oh, you strapped, motherfucker?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.961
No, no, no, no, no.
It's a contract.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.559
A contract between me and Jupiter.
lam ripping it up.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.967
- Keep the gun on him, Cho Cho.
- Yeah.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.938
- Okay, Cho-- is it Cho Cho?
- Cho Cho, that's right.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.337
Okay, please, Cho Cho,
lower your weapon.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.399
I come with respect
and apology in hand.

21:05.430 --> 21:09.003
I don't see no apology.

21:09.034 --> 21:12.572
- What, you write it down?
- No, but I ain't strapped.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.380
How we know
you ain't got no snipers?

21:15.407 --> 21:17.409
I'm a one-man operation, okay?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.820
Deshauwn, I am out of
the Jupiter game.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.325
I fucked up, never should've
came between two old friends.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.623
You deserve every percentage
of everything.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.756
I offer you my deepest apologies
and my sincerest regrets.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.788
Your client, once again your client.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.129
- And with, uh...
- Cho Cho.

21:31.156 --> 21:33.033
...Cho Cho's blessing,
I go in peace.

21:33.058 --> 21:36.403
If there's ever anything I can do for
you in the future, just let me know.

21:36.428 --> 21:41.673
Well, we can settle for a simple
"You're better than me, Deshauwn."

21:41.700 --> 21:44.010
If you can't decipher that
that's essentially what I'm saying,

21:44.036 --> 21:45.447
- you ain't better than me.
- Do me a favor.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.178
- Lose my number.
- Never had your number, Deshauwn.

21:48.206 --> 21:50.379
- Well, don't try to get it later!
- Respect.

21:50.409 --> 21:52.980
Gentlemen.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.423
(music playing)

21:57.049 --> 21:59.586
- Want me to pop him one?
- Yeah, put one in the air.

22:00.218 --> 22:03.062
- Oh!
- I said air, not ear!

22:03.088 --> 22:05.068
N-word!

22:06.325 --> 22:09.238
(cell phone buzzing)

22:11.863 --> 22:14.503
- This is Reggie.
- Hey, Reggie, it's Tom Werner.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.480
- Hey, Tom.
- Listen, I really liked the way

22:17.502 --> 22:19.413
you handled yourself
during that card game.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.475
- Thanks, Tom.
- Fenway Sports Group

22:21.506 --> 22:23.213
is thinking about
buying a hockey team.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.551
- What do you know about hockey?
- Nothing.

22:25.577 --> 22:26.783
That's perfect.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.884
When we bought Liverpool, most people
thought I didn't know much about soccer.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.724
Some people think I still don't.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.696
Listen, I'm coming down
to Atlanta next week.

22:33.719 --> 22:35.255
I think we should have lunch
and we can talk about

22:35.287 --> 22:37.961
- getting into business together.
- Sure thing, Tom.

22:37.989 --> 22:41.493
- Let me know.
- All right, see ya, Reggie.
