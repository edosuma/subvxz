I learned in the Marines,

That's what you want?

Steve Jobs, tossed aside like a
dishrag the minute he was born.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.858

11:39.365 --> 11:40.282

11:40.366 --> 11:43.369

$45 million,

11:43.452 --> 11:44.995
I'll push this button,
and no matter where you are,

to your regular loser self.

That's what parenting is.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.475
- Here's the thing, Jeff.

16:16.558 --> 16:17.893
{\an3}Your parents can't help you
make more money.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.603
{\an3}They're--they're dead ends.
They're leeches.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.439
{\an3}But--but me?
I can help you get rich

16:22.523 --> 16:25.651
{\an3}beyond your wildest dreams.
We could make billions.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.404
{\an1}- Oh, [bleep].
You and me together?

16:28.487 --> 16:30.823
{\an1}That would be like if Bon Jovi
and The Boss

16:30.906 --> 16:31.824
{\an1}formed some kind of super group
or something.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.742
Know what I'm sayin'?

16:33.826 --> 16:36.161
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.288
We could get all
the money

16:38.372 --> 16:41.458
and put huge golden walls
around our mansions.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.794
And all the people
would be out there with nothing.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.838
Like worms.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.090
- You, my friend,
just gave me a hard-on.

16:48.173 --> 16:53.303
{\an1}- Oh, I wish this moment
could last forever, Sammy.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.807
{\an3}- Oh, Zarlene, you're the
sunlight in my heart.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.600
You know that?
[zapping]

16:58.684 --> 17:01.770
{\an1}- You're the sunlight
in my heart too! [groans]

17:01.854 --> 17:03.647
- [screaming]
- This is what you get

17:03.731 --> 17:06.525
{\an1}when you [bleep]
with your friends, Sammy.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.901
[groans]
- Ahh! Stop it!

17:07.984 --> 17:09.569
I wasn't stealing!

17:09.653 --> 17:11.989
I was just taking your money
because I deserve it.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.950
Don't you see? [groaning]
- He's still an [bleep].

17:15.032 --> 17:16.535
{\an3}- I guess we'll have to go
deeper.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.788
- Stanley, I'm worried.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.833
{\an3}What if they blow the dam
with us still here?

17:22.915 --> 17:25.002
{\an1}- As long as we stay right here,
we're safe.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.796
{\an1}I mean, what are they gonna do?
Kill us?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.798
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
- Uh, just making sure--

17:29.882 --> 17:31.717
we're legally covered
if we kill them, right?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.802
{\an3}- Absolutely, sir.
We put up very clear signage.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.387
{\an1}- Hey, Jeff,
whaddaya think?

17:35.471 --> 17:36.972
- I think those pigdogs
have been standing on all fours

17:37.055 --> 17:40.517
in the way of my success
for way too long.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.312
I say we flush 'em out.
You can do the honors.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.982
I'd like to enjoy myself
while I'm on this [bleep] yacht.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.485
{\an1}Hey, Stacy, whaddaya say
we go downstairs

17:49.568 --> 17:52.196
{\an1}and you beat me with this
while I jerk off in the corner?

17:54.323 --> 17:58.368
{\an3}- Son? [wheezing]
Come closer.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.914
[coughing]
Make me one promise.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.540
- Anything, Dad.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.585
- You'll always be good
to Jimmy and Ted.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.378
{\an1}- Who?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.589
- You'll know what I'm talking
about one day.

18:10.672 --> 18:14.301
Oh, and you'll bake pumpkin
muffins whenever they ask.

18:14.384 --> 18:18.680
And you'll never mess
with the memory changer.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.432
Promise me!
[zapping]

18:20.516 --> 18:22.059
- Oh, and tell him he should
always give us foot massages.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.436
- No, come on, that's too much.
- What?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.188
{\an3}What are you talking about?
No, it's not.

18:26.271 --> 18:26.855
- Hey, hey, stop it! Stop!
- Give me that! Gimme!

18:26.939 --> 18:30.692
Give me!
[zapping]

18:30.776 --> 18:33.195
- Harder, harder!
Tell me I'm scum.

Ahh! Ahh! No!

{\an1}Stop it! What the hell's
the matter with you?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.952
- All right, Dennis, we'll
blow up the dam on my command.

18:40.035 --> 18:43.539
- No, no, stop!
Guys, guys, come on.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.915
What are we doing here?

18:44.998 --> 18:45.666
We're gonna destroy homes
and kill people?

18:45.749 --> 18:47.209
And for what?

18:47.292 --> 18:52.005
We're building a yacht marina
50 miles inland.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.507
There's gotta be a way
we can make money

18:53.590 --> 18:55.717
without screwing people over,
right?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.762

That doesn't make any sense.

- Whoa! O--okay.
I--I'm listening.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.857
- From now on, you should let me
lead this company.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.735
Because there is a way
to make lots of money

19:13.819 --> 19:15.279

19:15.362 --> 19:17.197
