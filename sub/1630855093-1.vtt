They're headed for Beacon!

- It's our school.

Or... it was?

02:04.959 --> 02:05.835

Uh...

02:12.008 --> 02:15.177
You know, like, your special power?

02:15.594 --> 02:20.016
I know what it is where I'm from.
Here? Only one way to find out.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.010
Something's messed with my powers.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.803
Don't worry. I got you!

02:59.472 --> 03:03.184
By the way, I'm Ruby.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.447
I'm fine.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.510
Uh, thanks for that.

03:38.094 --> 03:38.969
That was nothing.

03:39.345 --> 03:41.222

03:42.014 --> 03:43.432

03:45.226 --> 03:46.894
It looks like Earth's sun.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.189
Except it feels... different.

03:50.689 --> 03:51.774
Earth is...

03:52.483 --> 03:53.651
your world?

03:54.151 --> 03:57.279
Because you're from a different world.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.740
Because that's a thing.

03:59.824 --> 04:01.700

Yeah. Yeah, just-- just call me Clark.

04:29.979 --> 04:31.981
[Yang] So, how did you get here, Clark?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.692
I don't remember anything.

04:35.401 --> 04:36.694
Just images.

04:37.278 --> 04:41.073
I was fighting something
with my friends... as an adult?

04:41.157 --> 04:43.200
Are you sure you didn't hit your head?

04:43.576 --> 04:44.660
Something is wrong.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.914
These Grimm...
You said they don't shoot lasers?

04:49.039 --> 04:49.874
Not usually,

04:49.957 --> 04:53.961
but they also don't usually absorb
all the dust we shoot at them.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.881
[sighs] It's my fault.
I messed up your world by being here.

04:57.423 --> 04:58.674
I have to fix it.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.719
Whenever anything gets weird,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.555

Ozpin.

05:17.943 --> 05:18.986
Sorry, Mom.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.571
What did you say?

05:20.654 --> 05:22.990
I was asking how your studies have been.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.785
I worry about you.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.331
What you and your friends are doing...

05:30.706 --> 05:32.541
You are all just children.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.627
But I'm not a child, Mom.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.795
I haven't been one for a while.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.631
That's exactly what worries me.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.384
I'm glad you're on break from Beacon.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.303
But you and your friends...

05:44.970 --> 05:47.264
you're against so much danger.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.351
I'll always come back to you, Mom.

- Has she said anything?
- She...

06:27.388 --> 06:28.847
has some questions.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.476
Impressive. How's this for an answer?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.063
I don't want to cause harm.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.732
I just asked
to be taken to their leader.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.945
Are you a Faunus?

06:43.654 --> 06:45.197

- You know...

06:45.573 --> 06:46.407

[dramatic music playing]

07:00.838 --> 07:01.922
[Blake] A princess?

07:02.381 --> 07:04.008
From another world?

07:04.592 --> 07:06.343
And no memory of how you got here?

07:07.011 --> 07:08.929
I see flashes.

07:09.597 --> 07:13.350
In them, I'm an adult,
but I don't feel like that.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.810
I feel like I'm 16.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.562
[Blake] That doesn't make any sense.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.397
No kidding.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.816
What I do know is...

07:21.191 --> 07:24.737
the longer I'm away from my world,
the more people will get hurt.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.447
I have to return.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.700
Maybe my team can help you.
Let me call Yang.

07:30.034 --> 07:33.495
Blake, the CCT at Atlas
has been down for a while.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.164
Don't you remember?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.624
L...

07:38.542 --> 07:39.627
I don't.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.796
In that case, we go to Beacon.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.550
I don't know
what any of those words mean.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.929
The CCT is our
Cross Continental Transmit System.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.682
It's how the kingdoms
of our world communicate.

07:53.766 --> 07:57.770
But if that's not working,
then Ozpin is our next best option.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.440
Why isn't the CCT fixed yet?

08:01.732 --> 08:03.609
What are they doing, having a party?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.736

08:06.528 --> 08:08.489
Father, you're acting
like it doesn't matter

08:08.572 --> 08:10.532
that the communication system is down.

08:10.616 --> 08:11.659
[man sighs]

08:12.117 --> 08:16.080
Weiss, you can handle being away
from your friends for a few months.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.624
You know something is wrong,
but, as usual,

08:18.707 --> 08:21.085
you won't sacrifice the dust
needed to help people.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.129
It's not my job to fix the CCT.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.257
If not us, then who?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.134
Uh...

08:29.468 --> 08:31.261
What was I saying before?

08:31.887 --> 08:34.347
Did you see the size of that suit?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.350
Yes.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.073

this isn't a costume party.

- I saw your outburst with your dad.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.553
Can't say I blame you.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.346
The rich are the same in every universe.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.390
Chronically ignorant
to the plights of others.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.937
I'm not one for parties, either.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.648
I usually try to find some secret room
to hole up in.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.066
You ever tried it?

09:26.150 --> 09:29.987
Hmm, a dust lab would be at the top
of my preferred hiding places.

09:30.988 --> 09:31.822
Dust?

09:34.825 --> 09:39.037
Like, specific dust
or just general dust?

09:39.121 --> 09:41.123
Schnees deal in general dust.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.543
Can't allow ourselves to limit
the natural energy sources we can use.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.378
Of course.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.840
Because dust... is an energy source.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.260
Right.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.681
I thought I knew
all the upper-class families.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.184
At least the ones
that have access to labs.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.853
I'm from a little further out.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.397

10:05.856 --> 10:06.690
Sure.

Bruce Wayne, you said?

10:31.799 --> 10:32.716
Thief!

10:32.800 --> 10:35.052
Someone stole my lab key!

10:37.971 --> 10:40.849
I did tell you I like to hide
in secret rooms at parties.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.519
Weiss! Wait!

10:43.894 --> 10:46.939
- I need your help.
- I don't help common thieves.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.775
Something is wrong
and I think I may know what it is.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.776
Your memories.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.820
You're having a hard time
connecting to them.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.697
They're like soup in your brain, right?

10:58.492 --> 10:59.326
Please.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.915
- We'll find them, sir.
- Here's your thief.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.708

11:07.417 --> 11:10.754
Weiss, listen. I'm not from Vacuo.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.215
Or Mistral. Or from Remnant at all.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.677
I have to get to a lab to figure out
what brought me here so I can go back.

Whoa!

12:08.770 --> 12:11.440
Oh, come on! How does Clark do this?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.527
[dramatic piano music continues]

12:20.532 --> 12:22.492
He must work for the White Fang.

12:22.701 --> 12:27.122
But a terrorist organization
will not scare the Schnees.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.373
Take him away.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.626
White Fang?

12:30.709 --> 12:33.670
Weiss, you know I'm right!
You know we're out of place!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.012
[Ruby gasping for breath]

12:43.305 --> 12:45.223
How are you not tired?

12:45.891 --> 12:50.145
- We ran the whole way!
- Yeah. I guess it's my semblance?

12:50.687 --> 12:52.147
As long as I'm not in the shade.

12:52.689 --> 12:57.402
You said it's the physical...
something of my something?

12:57.486 --> 13:00.864
Physical manifestation of your aura.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.825
Auras. Right. Basically, your soul.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.078
Got it. I think.

13:07.245 --> 13:11.124
Does this place feel
sort of empty to you guys?

13:11.208 --> 13:13.251
We didn't run into anyone
on the way here.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.169
You're right.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.464
But Ozpin will have the answers.
He always does.

13:21.969 --> 13:22.803
Yang?

13:23.178 --> 13:24.012
Blake!

13:25.806 --> 13:27.933
You got pulled into this weirdness, too?

13:28.266 --> 13:30.227
Guess we all had the same idea.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.145
- Wonder Woman?
- Superman.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.318
- Superman?
- Yeah, we just call him Clark.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.946
This is my friend, Diana.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.324
Diana, this is Ruby and Yang.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.494
[Diana] And this is Blake.
Do we know if the others are here?

13:47.577 --> 13:49.496
You're the first familiar face
that I've seen.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.125
Well, mostly familiar.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.420
We weren't teenagers before this, right?

13:56.920 --> 13:59.214

Just“

Something mechanical.

<i>And big.</i>

14:09.725 --> 14:11.852
That's all I remember since
waking up in Menagerie.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.104
Wait. You were in Menagerie?

14:14.479 --> 14:17.024
Isn't that, like, a long trip?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.026
When did you guys get to Beacon?

14:19.651 --> 14:22.696
It felt like we set out this morning.

14:23.447 --> 14:26.658
<i>[Blake] So, here I am.
A criminal hiding in plain view.</i>

14:27.409 --> 14:29.327
<i>All with the help of the little
black tower.</i>

14:31.913 --> 14:32.748
This is...

14:33.582 --> 14:34.958
This is all wrong.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.628
[Ruby] Wow!

14:39.379 --> 14:40.672
[screaming]

14:40.756 --> 14:42.007
[suspenseful music playing]

14:45.719 --> 14:46.553
Beacon...

14:47.012 --> 14:48.597
It fell.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.057
[Ruby] Guys...

14:50.932 --> 14:52.184
this isn't right.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.561
That could explain why we're teens.

14:55.187 --> 14:56.021
Maybe...

14:56.688 --> 14:57.689
Did we do this?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.524
[elevator dings]

15:01.818 --> 15:02.652
Students.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.533
-Ozpin?
-Do you know what's going on?

15:08.617 --> 15:12.037
The Grimm are acting really weird.
They shoot lasers!

15:12.704 --> 15:14.289
You shouldn't be here.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.835
<i>[girl] Professor Ozpin? ls that you?</i>

15:20.087 --> 15:21.421
Neither should you.

15:21.505 --> 15:26.176
Uh, is changing into a small
boy his semblance?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.305
[Yang] No. I...

15:31.098 --> 15:32.432
I don't think so.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.392
Ozpin died.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.020
Then reincarnated as Oscar.

15:37.687 --> 15:38.980
Tell us what's going on.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.482
Where are our friends?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.526
Whoo! She is...

15:43.735 --> 15:44.569
very strong.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.822
-And?
-Er, just an observation.

15:46.905 --> 15:47.739
[Diana] Huh?

15:48.156 --> 15:50.117
But you were just...

15:51.159 --> 15:53.036
[Ozpin] You five should be in training.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.747
There's been a report of Grimm
on the edge of town.

15:56.706 --> 15:57.541
Come with me.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.668
[suspenseful music playing]

16:00.752 --> 16:02.462
That was weird.

16:02.546 --> 16:03.880
Should we follow him?

16:03.964 --> 16:07.467
We need to get things back to normal
as soon as possible.

16:07.551 --> 16:08.385
Hmm.

16:10.262 --> 16:11.096
Hmm?

16:14.141 --> 16:17.018
Hmm... Oh! Uh...

16:17.644 --> 16:18.478
Uh?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.188
[Glynda] Miss Cruz?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.694
So, our aura-soul thing

16:25.777 --> 16:29.197
controls our semblance-power thing.

16:29.573 --> 16:30.407
Right?

16:31.449 --> 16:33.660
Correct. More or less.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.621
What if we can't connect
to our semblance?

16:37.164 --> 16:39.624
It may take some time,
but you'll get there.

16:40.041 --> 16:43.545
Now, who can tell me about
the different kinds of dust?

16:44.254 --> 16:48.425
There are a bunch of different colors.
They're in all the weapons.

16:48.508 --> 16:54.097
Yes. But what color dust
coordinates with which energy source?

16:54.181 --> 16:57.893
Red, fire. Yellow, electricity.
Et cetera, et cetera.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.523
Something smells different.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.483
And how did you know all that?

17:05.567 --> 17:08.944
[chuckles] You'd know the answers, too,
if you paid attention.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.196
Hmm.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.114
I don't know.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.867
[sighs] Why are we learning kids' stuff?

17:13.950 --> 17:16.578
-Beats me.
-This is weird, right?

17:16.661 --> 17:20.457
-Feels like something's off.
-Something's definitely sideways.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.252
The tech here feels weird. Hollow.

17:24.336 --> 17:25.837
You've adjusted quickly.

17:25.921 --> 17:27.839
Just a little while ago
you were freaking out.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.468
What? You haven't learned
how to adapt thanks to childhood trauma?

17:32.427 --> 17:33.386
[grunts in frustration]

17:33.845 --> 17:34.846
[clears throat]

17:34.930 --> 17:39.017
Well, it seems you all
have more important things

17:39.100 --> 17:41.061
to talk about than your lessons.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.021
In that case...

17:43.104 --> 17:44.189
[action music playing]

18:03.541 --> 18:05.168
-Sorry, Nora!
-Hiya!

18:05.919 --> 18:07.045
Hiya!

18:08.797 --> 18:10.632
Mari, use your power!

18:10.715 --> 18:13.551
Oh! Do you mean my semblance or my dust?

18:14.094 --> 18:17.264
I'm still not sure
what the difference is.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.267
My necklace is gone, remember?

18:20.976 --> 18:23.186
Hey, Jessica, how you doing?

18:24.562 --> 18:26.856
Come on. Come on.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.277
She's been better.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.491
Here! Use my machine!

18:38.868 --> 18:40.620
[Mari] I don't want to use your machine.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.498
I want to use my necklace
to summon eagle's flight!

19:07.439 --> 19:09.274
-Barry!
-He's fine.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.985
He's in pain!

19:12.652 --> 19:13.862
[action music continues]

19:20.744 --> 19:22.579
Could really use Superman
right about now.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.913
Come on, guys.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.167
Voted for Homecoming King yet?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.585
[Jessica laughs]

19:31.296 --> 19:32.630
Uh...

19:34.132 --> 19:37.052
Remember, students,
that there are Grimm in the forest.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.012
This is really freaking me out.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.848
It's like he's not really here.

19:42.599 --> 19:46.770
-Any idea what happened to him?
-My mom said some weird stuff, too.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.440
-I didn't think anything of it, but--
-What is going on?

19:53.943 --> 19:55.445
Hey. Where did Ozpin go?

19:55.528 --> 19:58.323
Or-- Wait. Was it Oscar?
No, that's wrong, right?

19:58.406 --> 20:01.493
Oscar isn't old enough
to look like Ozpin. I think.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.703
How old is he?

20:03.787 --> 20:07.332
In normal years or
possessed-by-a-ancient-immortal years?

20:08.166 --> 20:10.126
ls that like dog years?

20:11.336 --> 20:12.504
That must be them.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.217
Yes!

20:17.884 --> 20:18.718
Huh...

20:18.802 --> 20:21.179
- Vixen.
- I'm so happy to see you two.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.182
I hated being a teen
the first time around.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.185
-How long have you been here?
-[Vixen] Um...

20:27.685 --> 20:30.939
Three days? No. This morning?

20:31.689 --> 20:33.316
It's hard to tell. You?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.151
I feel like it's only been since...

20:35.902 --> 20:36.903
this morning.

20:36.986 --> 20:40.573
I just want to get back home.
And back to normal.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.617
We've made some friends
who should be able to help.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.496
Justice League, meet Ruby,
Yang and Blake.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.166
And these are our friends.
Jaune, Nora and Ren.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.419
- Oh. So, we don't have to kill them?
- Hmm.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.878
I'd like to see you try.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.423
I would not.
Nobody needs to do any killing.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.716
So, you guys aren't from here either?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.010
Well, from what Diana
and I have pieced together,

21:01.094 --> 21:04.347
we were fighting some large mech...

21:04.431 --> 21:08.059
with no memory of anything
until showing up here.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.228
Well, that's a dead end then, right?

21:10.311 --> 21:12.313
Flash and I have been trying to remember

21:12.397 --> 21:14.566
so we can figure out
how to send ourselves back.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.609
The tech here hasn't been
particularly helpful.

21:17.694 --> 21:18.528
Brainiac?

21:18.945 --> 21:22.323
Maybe Vandal Savage,
if it's a time travel thing?

21:22.407 --> 21:24.117
What about that one guy, um... uh...

21:25.160 --> 21:25.994
Kilg%re?

21:26.077 --> 21:28.246
That lunatic who wants
to take over the world?

21:28.329 --> 21:29.330
You said it before.

21:29.414 --> 21:32.542
Kilg%re is a delusional electrical wire
short of a full panel.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.836
But is the question who did this?

21:34.919 --> 21:37.922
Or is it why are we someplace
called Remnant?

21:38.256 --> 21:39.716
If this really is Remnant.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.134
We'll find out.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.761
But we aren't all together yet.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.097
Hmm.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.725
Where's Batman?

21:51.603 --> 21:53.438
[action music playing]

22:05.200 --> 22:06.034
Wow.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.048
Hmm?

22:31.100 --> 22:31.935
Okay.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.561
Too much too fast.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.146
Noted.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.357
-So,
-Huh?

22:38.066 --> 22:40.068
I take it the bat costume was yours?

22:41.486 --> 22:42.403
You believe me.

22:42.946 --> 22:46.824
I did some digging around,
and I think you're onto something.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.910
About your memories fraying?

22:50.286 --> 22:52.830
-How do you know that?
-A hunch.

22:52.914 --> 22:58.002
If I can get a look at what makes
up your world and your dust,

22:58.086 --> 23:00.171
I might be able to figure out
what's going on.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.674
That's what I was trying
to do at the party.

23:02.757 --> 23:03.591
Ah, yes.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.594
Stealing the keys to the lab.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.847
There are easier ways
to break in, you know.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.392
Hmph. Or out.

23:24.654 --> 23:25.822
I was waiting for you.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.158
I had a feeling you'd want answers, too.

23:32.537 --> 23:33.830
The lab is this way.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.592
Where could he be?

23:46.050 --> 23:49.804
Sorry. I can't believe
you have a teammate named Batman.

23:49.887 --> 23:53.266
Now is that better or worse
than a teammate named Superman?

23:53.349 --> 23:54.684
-Right?
-Focus.

23:55.518 --> 23:59.606
He could be anywhere.
And Remnant is a big place.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.652
Yang and I found Clark.
Diana woke up on Menagerie near Blake.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.738
And the rest, well--

24:06.821 --> 24:09.198
They were in the dorms next to ours.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.451
We only noticed when
we heard Jessica crying.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.786
[grunts in irritation] I wasn't crying!

24:13.870 --> 24:15.955
Hey, it's okay.

24:17.874 --> 24:21.377
-You were a little, though.
-I was trying to find my ring.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.588
Yeah, and my necklace is gone, too.

24:24.047 --> 24:27.133
So, we've all been dropped
near members of your teams.

24:28.426 --> 24:30.345
Has anyone heard from Weiss?

24:31.846 --> 24:34.724
I tried calling her,
but there was no answer.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.602
-Communication isn't working.
-Do you think that's connected?

24:37.685 --> 24:39.145
What runs the communication system?

24:39.562 --> 24:40.396
Dust.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.190
It runs everything.

24:43.358 --> 24:46.235
The Grimm we saw in the forest
was absorbing it.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.197
You think it could be using
the dust for its energy?

24:50.573 --> 24:51.866
Batman would know.

24:52.575 --> 24:53.701
Where would Weiss be?

24:53.785 --> 24:55.328
Well, if Blake was in Menagerie

24:55.411 --> 24:58.081
and Yang and I were
in the woods by Beacon,

24:58.164 --> 24:59.874
then Weiss might be in Atlas.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.586
You probably don't need me, right?

25:03.961 --> 25:05.838
Jessica, what's going on?

25:05.922 --> 25:10.093
I've been trying to tap
into my semblance thing this whole time,

25:10.176 --> 25:12.428
but I need my ring.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.306
It's got to be on this world somewhere.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.434
-Jessica, we don't have time to--
-Ring?

25:19.060 --> 25:20.978
Bright green with a weird design?

25:21.646 --> 25:22.563
I've seen it.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.440
It's in Ozpin's office.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.401
-Why don't we-- Uh...
-[woman's voice echoes] Jaune?

25:27.485 --> 25:28.319
<i>Jaune?</i>

25:29.529 --> 25:30.363
<i>Jaune?</i>

25:31.447 --> 25:32.323
Jaune?

25:33.741 --> 25:35.159
There are 12 of us.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.537
We don't all need
to go looking for Bruce.

25:37.620 --> 25:41.374
Okay. So Lantern can go get her ring
back while we look for Batman.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.251
- What?
- VVell, we could--

25:43.334 --> 25:45.461
Hold on. I'm not following
someone into battle

25:45.545 --> 25:47.088
who's never been on Remnant before.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.047
Me neither.

25:48.131 --> 25:51.426
You can't just barge into our world
like you know what you're doing.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.262
Sorry. They do this.

25:54.804 --> 25:57.557
Blondie has a point.
Their world, their rules.

25:57.974 --> 26:01.144
Even if their rules involve
figuring out this semblance thing.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.771
Hey, all right, even those of us
from here can have a hard time with it.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.400
There's another thing
we haven't talked about.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.610
The Grimm in the forest.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.320
We've fought monsters before.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.239
I don't know
what you have on your world,

26:13.322 --> 26:17.577
but Grimm, they're soulless creatures
with only one purpose.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.912
To destroy humanity.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.206
I've never seen anything
like them before.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.084
We need to figure out
how to get back, now.

26:25.168 --> 26:26.711
I think we all need to--

26:26.794 --> 26:28.212
We aren't going without Bruce.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.256
-Why are you calling the shots?
-No, huh--

26:30.339 --> 26:33.176
-I need to get my ring.
-We should be able to--

26:33.259 --> 26:34.385
Hey!

26:35.595 --> 26:36.637
[Superman] We should split up.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.891
One group goes with Jessica
to get her ring back,

26:39.974 --> 26:41.434
one group looks for Bruce.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.437
The rest of us are gonna
check out these weird Grimm.

26:45.021 --> 26:47.106
They might shed some light
on what's going on.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.692
Or, at least, how to get back.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.363
That's exactly what I was trying to say.

26:55.198 --> 26:57.700
- I'll head to the forest.
- I'll take Diana to Atlas.

26:57.784 --> 26:58.826
Uh, me, too!

27:00.536 --> 27:02.622
-[Ruby chuckles]
- I'll go with Ruby to track down Grimm.

27:02.705 --> 27:04.165
All right, sticking with you, Blue Boy.

27:04.248 --> 27:08.461
I'll go too. If there's Grimm
to smash, I want to smash them.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.714
Cyborg, want to stay behind
with Lantern? Hack into their computers?

27:11.798 --> 27:14.133
Eh! I already tried that. No luck.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.260
Just some weird numbers
over and over again.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.597
I volunteer for the creepy
monster mission in the woods with Nora.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.307
Me, too.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.227
Um... I...

27:25.812 --> 27:26.896
I don't want to go alone.

27:28.481 --> 27:29.649
I'll go with you.

27:31.984 --> 27:32.985
Vixen?

27:34.362 --> 27:35.238
Why not?

27:35.696 --> 27:38.449
Always love following
you into certain death, Supes.

27:38.533 --> 27:39.575
[Superman chuckles]

27:40.117 --> 27:41.118
Good luck, everyone.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.665
So, your home is called Gotham?

27:45.748 --> 27:49.126
And on your world, you're an adult?

27:49.585 --> 27:50.545
I don't...

27:51.462 --> 27:53.965
The evidence suggests
that was the case, but...

27:54.507 --> 27:56.092
I feel like I'm a teenager.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.010
It's weird.

27:58.094 --> 28:00.179
I didn't have the chance
to be a teen before.

28:00.721 --> 28:01.556
I don't like it.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.601
So, uh, where's this lab?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.395
Just around here.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.987
-Grimm.
-They don't look very friendly.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.823
The lab. It should be right there.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.826
-l'll distract them. You--
-Wait.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.830
Are you really
telling me how to fight Grimm?

28:27.582 --> 28:30.501
-They're illusions.
-This isn't your world.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.130
The lab's behind them, hidden.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.048
Someone doesn't want
us getting in there.

28:36.716 --> 28:39.343
Well, have I got news for them.

28:42.513 --> 28:43.973
[action music playing]

28:51.314 --> 28:53.190
Figure out how to shut them down.

29:01.532 --> 29:04.869
Weiss! Stop using the dust!
They're feeding off of it!

29:05.369 --> 29:06.203
Huh?

29:11.751 --> 29:15.171
-I thought you said they were illusions.
-They're good illusions.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.381
Deadly illusions. Got it.

29:34.815 --> 29:35.983
Any luck with the door?

29:36.067 --> 29:38.945
There's an electrical current
preventing anyone from getting in.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.112
I found a weakness,

29:40.196 --> 29:42.365
but I need something small
enough to cut through.

29:51.374 --> 29:52.333
Hurry!

30:14.897 --> 30:15.898
[Weiss clears throat]

30:16.315 --> 30:19.151
You know, it's a shame
you're not from Remnant.

30:19.235 --> 30:21.195
It feels like you belong.

30:31.372 --> 30:32.581
I feel ridiculous.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.793
What? You don't like
being back in high school?

30:36.293 --> 30:38.170
I don't like having an actual tail.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.715
Oh, come on. It suits you.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.466
Well, you're not the one
who keeps sitting on it.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.807
Can I help you with something?

30:49.890 --> 30:52.935
I've noticed you're really
great with weapons.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.479
And since we aren't around
a lot of electronics out here,

30:55.563 --> 30:58.524
I was thinking...
I might not be a lot of help.

30:59.316 --> 31:03.154
-Could you show me a couple tricks?
-We're all a little busy here.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.198
Ren, I can answer for myself.

31:06.782 --> 31:09.493
No, Nora. I-- I know, but--

31:09.577 --> 31:12.204
And I thought this was going
to be a boring monster hunt.

31:14.081 --> 31:16.000
-[Flash grunts]
- Oh, sorry about that.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.252
-Hey, man, I'm not trying to--
-Not trying to what?

31:18.335 --> 31:21.047
You know, this is the most
you've said to me this whole time.

31:21.130 --> 31:23.215
-I don't say much to anyone.
-Guys--

31:23.299 --> 31:26.093
Look, I already work with a strong,
silent type that looks down on everyone.

31:26.177 --> 31:29.263
-And you're no Batman.
-Okay, everyone, calm down.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.514
And you're not my dad.

31:30.598 --> 31:32.433
Well, you're acting like a kid.

31:32.516 --> 31:33.809
No, I'm not!

31:33.893 --> 31:36.353
I'm trying to figure out
how to avoid certain doom.

31:36.437 --> 31:39.231
-That's not what kids do.
-That's what we do.

31:39.315 --> 31:43.194
We have to protect everyone.
And take care of each other.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.112
And who are you, pipsqueak?

31:45.196 --> 31:46.280
-Hey!
-Cyb0rg!

31:46.363 --> 31:47.198
I...

31:52.411 --> 31:54.288
Yeah. That sucked. I know.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.417
I just hate not feeling useful.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.545
I'm gonna scout.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.839
Clear my head.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.093
You Okay?

32:07.176 --> 32:13.307
I've been doing this leader thing
for a while now and sometimes it's...

32:15.142 --> 32:17.978
Sometimes it's just so...

32:22.525 --> 32:23.734
[Flash laughing]

32:24.151 --> 32:25.319
I know what you mean.

32:26.153 --> 32:29.156
Everything you do
is the end of the world,

32:29.240 --> 32:30.407
and nothing can stop it.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.285
Just so you know, that doesn't go away.

32:34.495 --> 32:35.871
Even when you're a grown-up.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.836
I'm... I'm sorry. It's, uh...

32:42.920 --> 32:45.965
It's hard to take you seriously
when you're Yang's age.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.008
Yeah.

32:48.509 --> 32:49.468
Uh...

32:51.303 --> 32:52.805
Hey, we have a problem!

33:02.690 --> 33:03.524
Find anything?

33:04.650 --> 33:05.693
She said it was on the desk,

33:05.776 --> 33:08.445
butPve|00ked
over the whole thing. Twice.

33:09.029 --> 33:12.032
Oh! This would be so much easier
if I actually had my ring!

33:12.366 --> 33:14.201
I could just scan the desk.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.620
This piece ofjewelry
is really important to you, huh?

33:16.704 --> 33:21.458
Oh, it's not just a piece ofjewelry!
It's my strength.

33:21.542 --> 33:26.213
It's the thing that keeps me together,
and without it... Without it...

33:27.423 --> 33:30.009
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

33:31.093 --> 33:34.180
Do you think that's why you haven't
been able to access your semblance?

33:44.064 --> 33:45.191
I've been there.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.276
How did you access it?

33:48.736 --> 33:49.570
Uh...

33:49.820 --> 33:52.198
A friend believed in me.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.074
That's all?

33:54.575 --> 33:55.951
Well, try it out.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.205
Fine.

34:02.333 --> 34:03.167
Doing floor time.

34:04.001 --> 34:04.835
Cool.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.049
It's also okay if it doesn't happen.

34:10.132 --> 34:11.800
What? You said you believed in me.

34:11.884 --> 34:14.887
I do, Jessica, but you're putting
a lot of pressure on yourself.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.431
You're no less of a person if you can't.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.891
[clock ticking]

34:23.978 --> 34:27.190
<i>-Jessica ? Jessica ?
-What?</i>

34:30.694 --> 34:32.279
<i>Did it work?</i>

34:34.697 --> 34:36.116
My ring?

34:37.784 --> 34:40.536
I can hear you. Did I go anywhere?

34:41.246 --> 34:44.083
No. You're still on the floor.

34:44.833 --> 34:45.833
What's going on?

34:45.918 --> 34:48.295
I... I don't know. I...

34:48.754 --> 34:51.465
It's a white room. No windows.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.467
No doors. And I can't get out.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.594
I don't like being trapped.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.643
What? What is that?

35:03.269 --> 35:04.270
It feels...

35:05.145 --> 35:05.980
different.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.564
It's my semblance.

35:07.648 --> 35:10.109
I help enhance whatever yours is.

35:11.652 --> 35:12.486
Try again.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.866
[rumbling]

35:18.826 --> 35:20.202
I can't.

35:20.286 --> 35:23.831
I have the ring,
but it's not working.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.166
Okay.

35:27.918 --> 35:30.713
Talk to me about it.
What does it feel like when it works?

35:31.880 --> 35:32.715
Hmm.

35:33.424 --> 35:34.758
l used to...

35:36.260 --> 35:37.636
I used to not want it.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.472
I didn't feel like I deserved it.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.851
It's a symbol of power on my world,

35:44.435 --> 35:47.271
but it's also supposed
to be a symbol of belonging.

35:48.022 --> 35:51.233
And I always wanted to belong,
so badly.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.527
To fit into my skin.

35:54.320 --> 35:58.449
And yet here I was,
forever different than my friends.

35:59.825 --> 36:04.246
Because the ring brought experiences
that they could never imagine,

36:04.330 --> 36:06.749
that they'll never have to live through,
but...

36:07.833 --> 36:09.209
but I never want them to live through.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.464
But at least, with the ring,

36:14.757 --> 36:17.176
I always felt like I had control.

36:18.552 --> 36:22.556
I could construct whatever I wanted,
whatever I could imagine,

36:22.639 --> 36:24.808
even if everything was out of my hands.

36:25.601 --> 36:31.273
And somehow in the in-between,
everything got all quiet.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.942
I could find myself.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.944
<i>[Jaune] You changed the room!</i>

36:38.697 --> 36:39.740
What are you doing here?

36:39.823 --> 36:42.951
This was Ozpin's office,
but now it's that white space.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.916
Or we were never in Ozpin's office.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.543
Or on Remnant at all.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.587
This is where we've been all along.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.090
Your ring, it...

36:56.173 --> 36:57.966
it sounds like it gets
to the truth of things.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.259
The truth of you.

37:00.386 --> 37:03.555
I bet-- I bet that's what
your semblance does, too!

37:03.847 --> 37:05.224
With or without the ring.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.477
We aren't in your world. Or mine!

37:08.560 --> 37:10.437
This is all an illusion!

37:13.482 --> 37:14.983
There's no door!

37:17.486 --> 37:20.864
-I can't get out!
-Unless that's an illusion, too.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.158
And if this guy's an illusion...

37:25.327 --> 37:27.329
-What are you doing?
-Hold on!

37:30.707 --> 37:31.834
Jessica, is it--

37:35.963 --> 37:39.007
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

37:40.634 --> 37:41.969
Pyrfha!

37:42.052 --> 37:44.596
Stop. Stop.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.273
Okay.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.484
That definitely felt like real pain.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.029
We have to tell the others.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.489
If we're in an illusion,

38:02.573 --> 38:06.285
then we were all brought here by someone
that can transfer our consciousness.

38:06.994 --> 38:11.457
And whoever brought us here
must be controlling this place.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.357
Ow.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.404
So, how's it going?

38:43.197 --> 38:44.615
Just swell.

38:47.493 --> 38:48.660
It's different than home.

38:49.578 --> 38:54.917
There, I don't have to imagine gauntlets
to fly or a lasso for strength.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.752
Those are powers you have on your world?

38:57.294 --> 38:59.087
And they just... happen?

38:59.755 --> 39:01.089
They come from different places.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.383
Mine are a gift from the gods.

39:04.259 --> 39:07.262
Superman's come from the sun,
more or less.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.724
Each of us learned how
to save the world on our own.

39:11.892 --> 39:13.352
At least you guys learned together.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.105
- Who's flying the ship?
- Autopilot.

39:17.648 --> 39:19.900
I set the proximity alert
for when we get near Atlas.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.277
What about Grimm? Can they fly?

39:22.361 --> 39:25.405
Some can.
The alert will sound for them, too.

39:25.489 --> 39:28.200
Grimm are attracted
to negative emotions,

39:28.283 --> 39:31.495
and something tells me we might
have a lot of those right now.

39:32.454 --> 39:33.956
You have to stay focused.

39:34.498 --> 39:35.541
All the time.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.668
Just about.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.379
[all grunting]

39:43.674 --> 39:44.675
[Yang] Everything okay?

39:45.300 --> 39:47.427
It's nice here. With you guys.

39:48.637 --> 39:51.265
I like my team. I really do, but...

39:52.516 --> 39:54.434
they don't understand.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.478
That happens with teams.

39:57.145 --> 40:00.816
Yang and I didn't exactly
get along at first, but now...

40:01.900 --> 40:02.734
No.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.989
I grew up like a warrior.
On an island with other warriors.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.701
We trained together, fought together.

40:11.535 --> 40:12.369
Like us.

40:14.371 --> 40:15.247
Yeah.

40:15.872 --> 40:19.293
But my teammates, they...
they didn't grow up like I did.

40:20.377 --> 40:23.505
They don't always understand
what being a warrior means.

40:23.589 --> 40:24.756
They sound lucky.

40:26.008 --> 40:29.177
They've never had to worry they were
gonna die just from going to school.

40:29.595 --> 40:33.682
To train like your life or, worse,
your friends' lives depend on it.

40:34.224 --> 40:36.935
To have to live with the fact
that there's a real chance

40:37.019 --> 40:38.228
you're gonna lose them.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.398
They had a childhood.

40:42.649 --> 40:43.483
Blake...

40:47.613 --> 40:49.114
What was that?

40:49.197 --> 40:50.866
[action music playing]

40:59.041 --> 41:00.042
Grimm!

41:00.834 --> 41:03.462
-Let's see what they're after.
-Yang, open the hatch!

41:03.545 --> 41:05.881
Are you really doing
what I think you're doing?

41:06.673 --> 41:09.259
You heard Diana. We're warriors.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.655
Whoa! Okay. Whoa!

41:30.238 --> 41:31.698
Easy. Easy.

41:33.075 --> 41:33.909
All right.

41:41.917 --> 41:42.793
Blake!

41:52.636 --> 41:54.179
[Blake] It's absorbing the dust!

[Blake gasps]

42:23.250 --> 42:24.084
Whoa!

42:28.422 --> 42:29.715
Pitch the ship!

42:31.425 --> 42:32.718
Trust me!

[Diane grunts]

42:57.451 --> 42:58.535
Nice job!

43:05.709 --> 43:07.294
We're still in the school?

43:07.377 --> 43:10.255
Jaune... Trapped! We're trapped!

43:10.338 --> 43:11.256
[woman's voice] Jaune?

43:11.757 --> 43:13.925
Who could be doing this to us?

43:14.009 --> 43:15.177
[woman's voice] Jaune.

43:15.969 --> 43:17.053
<i>Is that you?</i>

43:18.305 --> 43:19.473
Do you hear her?

43:20.474 --> 43:23.685
Jaune, someone is controlling
this space.

43:24.019 --> 43:25.312
Whatever you're hearing,

43:26.146 --> 43:27.314
it's not real.

43:29.900 --> 43:31.026
Of course it's not real.

43:32.194 --> 43:33.028
She's gone.

43:36.114 --> 43:37.407
<i>[woman's voice] Really, Jaune?</i>

43:39.534 --> 43:41.036
-She?
-You can't be here.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.329
Who do you think you're hearing?

43:42.412 --> 43:44.748
I know this isn't real.
I saw the white room.

43:45.624 --> 43:47.125
[suspenseful music playing]

43:48.794 --> 43:52.088
I could really use a close
of reality right now, Jess.

43:52.881 --> 43:54.674
Can you take control of this hallway?

43:59.679 --> 44:01.097
I'm trying- I"

44:04.142 --> 44:06.895
<i>[woman's voice] Let me. I can help.</i>

44:07.354 --> 44:08.396
<i>Just ask.</i>

44:09.481 --> 44:12.234
Fine. Pyrrha, help us.

44:15.028 --> 44:16.196
What was that?

44:18.949 --> 44:20.700
[suspenseful music playing]

44:25.997 --> 44:27.415
[action music playing]

44:32.254 --> 44:35.090
-You guys have dragons?
-Not normally.

44:35.674 --> 44:36.758
And it's a Wyvern.

44:37.050 --> 44:38.009
Uh...

44:38.093 --> 44:41.429
So... what do we do?

44:41.513 --> 44:42.973
We fight.

44:44.891 --> 44:45.892
You heard her.

44:52.315 --> 44:53.316
[Nora screams]

45:01.783 --> 45:04.035
[Vixen grunts]

45:14.421 --> 45:15.547
[Cyborg screams]

45:17.924 --> 45:18.842
[Cyborg screams]

45:22.429 --> 45:23.763
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

45:28.518 --> 45:29.811
[action music continues]

45:30.687 --> 45:32.856

[Ruby grunts]

45:44.367 --> 45:45.452
[Nora shouts]

45:45.535 --> 45:46.369
Nora!

45:46.995 --> 45:47.913
I've got her!

45:48.163 --> 45:50.540
[Nora grunts]

45:50.624 --> 45:52.542
I can take care of myself!

45:57.213 --> 45:58.214
I'm okay.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.136
See what's up with Barry.

46:04.971 --> 46:07.849
-Anyone see what happened to Flash?
-Wait. What happened--

46:09.601 --> 46:10.518
Pay attention.

46:12.354 --> 46:14.981
Flash? Flash! He's hurt!

46:15.690 --> 46:18.026
-Do Grimm carry poison?
-Not this one.

46:18.109 --> 46:19.903
-What's going on with him?
-I don't know.

46:19.986 --> 46:22.948
It's like he went down as soon
as we started attacking the dragon.

46:23.031 --> 46:26.117
Ruby, how do we stop this thing
before it hurts anyone else?

46:26.201 --> 46:29.621
I... The last time I fought it, I--

46:33.124 --> 46:34.417
[dramatic music playing]

46:38.964 --> 46:39.798
Ruby?

46:40.298 --> 46:41.841
Something's not right.

46:41.925 --> 46:44.928
It doesn't feel like a normal Grimm.

46:45.011 --> 46:47.138
Okay. Plan B.

46:47.222 --> 46:48.515
Nora and Cyborg.

46:48.598 --> 46:51.851
You create an electrical charge
strong enough that Nora can absorb it

46:51.935 --> 46:53.687
and take this thing down.

46:53.770 --> 46:54.771
We'll clear a path.

46:57.357 --> 47:00.694
Hey, before, I didn't mean you couldn't
take care of yourself. That's not--

47:00.777 --> 47:02.487
-Hold my hand.
-What?

47:05.615 --> 47:06.574
[grunts]

47:13.623 --> 47:14.916
[action music playing]

47:15.959 --> 47:19.004
Count of three. One, two,

47:19.087 --> 47:20.005
-three!
-Three!

47:37.063 --> 47:38.356
Good job, you guys.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.191
I'm sorry that I just, uh--

47:49.159 --> 47:49.993
Uh...

47:50.577 --> 47:52.078
That's not supposed to happen.

47:57.042 --> 47:57.917
This lab...

47:58.752 --> 48:00.086
It has everything.

48:00.170 --> 48:01.713
[Weiss] More than normal.

48:01.796 --> 48:04.132
It isn't usually set up
like a command center.

48:04.215 --> 48:08.136
So, the Grimm are feeding off energy
like it's their personal power source

48:08.219 --> 48:11.514
and they protect this place that's not
normally set up like a command center.

48:12.474 --> 48:13.349
But why?

48:13.892 --> 48:14.726
There.

48:14.809 --> 48:18.980
That should show us
when the energy vampire Grimm show up.

48:19.189 --> 48:20.398
How'd you manage that?

48:20.815 --> 48:22.358
The Grimm outside lent a hand.

48:23.902 --> 48:25.111
It's strange.

48:25.195 --> 48:27.906
Usually, Grimm completely dissolve
when they're killed.

48:27.989 --> 48:29.491
Something's changed the rules.

48:29.866 --> 48:30.700
Hmm.

48:32.619 --> 48:33.453
With any luck,

48:33.536 --> 48:35.330
my friends are fighting
against one of these Grimm

48:35.413 --> 48:37.248
and we'll be able to track them down.

48:37.916 --> 48:40.460
What makes you think there's
anyone else from our worlds here?

48:41.836 --> 48:43.046
Maybe it's just you and me.

48:45.215 --> 48:47.801
You know,
if you can't find your way back,

48:48.468 --> 48:50.053
you could always stay on my world.

48:51.721 --> 48:53.807
You could belong in Remnant.

48:57.685 --> 48:58.895
Another dead end.

48:59.562 --> 49:00.688
Wow, it looks...

49:03.608 --> 49:04.943
just like I remember it.

49:07.821 --> 49:09.864
I didn't realize how much
I missed this place.

49:11.324 --> 49:12.158
How much it...

49:13.618 --> 49:15.286
-reminds me of--
-[Pyrrha] Jaune?

49:20.542 --> 49:21.584
[soft music playing]

49:24.796 --> 49:25.630
Jaune.

49:27.132 --> 49:27.966
What?

49:38.476 --> 49:40.854
Pyrrha, you can't... you can't be here.

49:41.354 --> 49:44.065
You're not real. None of this is real.

49:44.149 --> 49:47.652
lam real, Jaune. I promise.

49:48.361 --> 49:51.948
I will explain everything,
but we've got to go.

49:53.324 --> 49:56.911
[Jessica] Jaune, we need to tell
our teams what we've found.

49:58.663 --> 49:59.497
Pyrrha.

50:00.248 --> 50:02.458
She's been helping this whole time.

50:02.542 --> 50:04.169
I've heard her over and over,

50:04.252 --> 50:06.796
and then she showed us
the door when I called her.

50:07.463 --> 50:09.674
-But--
-You can't use your power, right? So...

50:10.758 --> 50:12.010
what are our other options?

50:14.429 --> 50:15.263
Okay.

50:15.972 --> 50:16.931
Let's go.

50:17.599 --> 50:18.516
Follow me.

50:20.602 --> 50:22.312
There's a shortcut we can take.

50:35.825 --> 50:38.411
Hurry. Your friends are in danger.

50:38.786 --> 50:40.830
You're... You're not coming with us?

50:43.833 --> 50:47.629
You cannot be allowed
to tell the Justice League.

50:47.921 --> 50:48.755
Pyrrha?

50:49.380 --> 50:51.925
Pyrrha, no! Pyrrha!

50:55.345 --> 50:56.930
[action music playing]

51:01.601 --> 51:02.435
[Vixen grunts]

51:12.987 --> 51:14.364
[Cyborg] Huh? Whoa!

51:15.782 --> 51:17.700
[Superman] You sure nothing
like this has happened before?

51:19.160 --> 51:20.286
ls your memory glitching?

51:20.370 --> 51:23.498
I think we would remember
if we'd seen a Grimm reboot,

51:23.581 --> 51:25.750
let alone split into a whole
other Grimm.

51:33.132 --> 51:34.300
Good job, Nora!

51:35.426 --> 51:36.344
What now, Ruby?

51:36.427 --> 51:38.263
Right. Uh, now, uh, now--

51:38.346 --> 51:41.432
See if anything that we've thrown
at the Wyvern has slowed it down at all.

51:43.476 --> 51:45.812
You're not the boss of us.
We aren't kids.

51:45.895 --> 51:48.356
-You are kids.
-So are you.

51:52.568 --> 51:56.489
Ruby, I don't mean to overstep,
but I've had experiences leading a team.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.700
- So have I!
- Clearly not enough.

52:01.494 --> 52:02.787
-Ruby, I--
-I had it.

52:02.870 --> 52:06.165
-You just had to give me a minute--
-Sometimes you don't have a minute.

52:07.709 --> 52:10.920
It's my fault that we're here.
I think I froze.

52:11.004 --> 52:11.879
[people screaming]

52:11.963 --> 52:12.964
<i>And my team...</i>

52:13.798 --> 52:15.633
We're stuck here because of me.

52:16.884 --> 52:17.844
Watch out!

52:22.849 --> 52:24.517
<i>Flash. Flash!</i>

52:25.476 --> 52:26.644
Are you okay?

52:26.894 --> 52:28.479
I don't know what's wrong with me.

52:29.564 --> 52:32.317
I do know I'm not much use to you guys.

52:33.151 --> 52:34.402
We need to talk.

52:36.738 --> 52:37.572
Nora!

52:43.244 --> 52:44.203
No!

52:45.705 --> 52:47.040
[Cyborg] The Grimm are swarming!

52:49.083 --> 52:50.126
[Superman] Ruby! Look out!

52:57.925 --> 53:01.304
-Why aren't you working?
-Weiss, look at this.

53:03.556 --> 53:06.392
There's a program that's running
on your communication system.

53:06.476 --> 53:08.019
Think that's why it's not working?

53:08.686 --> 53:11.314
Huh? I've seen that sequence before.

53:12.065 --> 53:14.692
I saw it when I was trying
to track the rest of my team.

53:14.776 --> 53:18.613
-I didn't think anything of it, but--
-It's on every system.

53:20.239 --> 53:21.824
It's the only program running.

53:22.200 --> 53:24.160
Which means if we can alter it--

53:24.243 --> 53:26.621
We'll be able to take control
of whatever this is.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.581
-[bui|ding rumbles]
-[Weiss gasps]

53:29.540 --> 53:30.375
Hmm.

53:33.961 --> 53:34.796
[both] Huh?

53:37.673 --> 53:40.468
These guys again? Don't use dust.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.804
What am I supposed to do? Spit on them?

53:44.514 --> 53:45.765
[action music playing]

54:24.720 --> 54:25.555
Bruce!

54:28.641 --> 54:29.851
There are too many of them!

54:32.103 --> 54:33.104
Hmm?

54:42.572 --> 54:43.406
So...

54:46.367 --> 54:47.452
what'd I miss?

54:47.535 --> 54:48.578
<i>[Jaune] Help us!</i>

54:50.163 --> 54:51.998
Please, Pyrrha!

54:52.582 --> 54:54.292
[Jessica] She wasn't real, Jaune.

54:56.210 --> 54:57.170
You know that.

54:58.838 --> 55:00.465
None of this is real.

55:01.549 --> 55:02.383
And now...

55:04.594 --> 55:05.636
we're gonna die.

55:09.348 --> 55:10.808
I shouldn't have trusted her.

55:12.852 --> 55:13.728
I'm sorry.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.981
She seemed important to you.

55:18.566 --> 55:19.400
She is.

55:21.777 --> 55:22.612
Was.

55:24.030 --> 55:25.490
I'm sorry you lost her.

55:26.282 --> 55:27.783
It was a long time ago.

55:29.744 --> 55:32.163
Time is only one part of grief.

55:39.754 --> 55:42.215
-Jaune, the walls.
-I see them.

55:42.298 --> 55:43.132
Jaune!

55:44.091 --> 55:45.343
Jaune!

55:45.426 --> 55:46.719
You can get us out of this.

55:48.554 --> 55:52.808
No. No, I can't!
I can't tap into my power here.

55:53.601 --> 55:57.271
I thought I was over my anxiety.
I thought I had dealt with it!

55:57.355 --> 55:59.315
Hey! Sometimes there are flare-ups.

55:59.398 --> 56:02.276
It's normal to be afraid,
but you're more than your fear.

56:02.985 --> 56:05.196
You are more than that ring.

56:07.615 --> 56:09.408
<i>[Blake] Run that by us one more time.</i>

56:09.534 --> 56:10.785
And speak slowly.

56:10.868 --> 56:14.664
Imagine that it's been a long day
and I am very tired.

56:16.832 --> 56:19.710
We aren't on Remnant. Or their world.

56:20.086 --> 56:22.588
We're somewhere else.

56:22.922 --> 56:24.340
Well, that explains my mom.

56:24.924 --> 56:27.927
And Ozpin. They're not real.

56:28.719 --> 56:30.513
They're like broken memories.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.265
-[Weiss] My dad, too.
-Batman?

56:32.348 --> 56:34.809
-[Weiss] We found a sequence.
-Bruce?

56:35.601 --> 56:38.437
-This is Diana. She's--
-I didn't think anyone else was here.

56:39.897 --> 56:43.109
...his teammate,
but you probably picked up on that.

56:43.818 --> 56:45.027
You look...

56:45.695 --> 56:46.821
different.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.614
This place is so strange.

56:49.532 --> 56:50.950
I just want to go home.

56:52.952 --> 56:54.787
You could still come with us.

56:55.538 --> 56:56.497
To Remnant.

56:58.583 --> 57:01.377
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

57:02.253 --> 57:04.005
Diana, this is Weiss.

57:05.464 --> 57:08.050
Hi, Weiss. It's nice to meet you.
I've heard great things about you.

57:08.801 --> 57:11.554
Bruce, their world isn't your home.

57:12.888 --> 57:15.349
We should probably get back
to the others.

57:20.938 --> 57:23.024
I have powers on their world, Diana.

57:23.608 --> 57:26.736
I never wanted powers.
I didn't think I needed them.

57:26.986 --> 57:29.238
But on Remnant, I can help.

57:30.406 --> 57:31.949
More than I could before.

57:33.159 --> 57:35.119
But you do help.

57:35.202 --> 57:36.746
You help on Earth.

57:36.829 --> 57:38.789
You have your own kind of powers. You--

57:38.873 --> 57:41.250
Maybe with these abilities,
I can do more.

57:43.336 --> 57:44.837
I can be like you.

57:46.505 --> 57:47.632
A warrior.

57:52.219 --> 57:53.179
Finally.

57:54.513 --> 57:56.682
-You figure out the sequence?
-No.

57:56.766 --> 58:00.519
But I have figured out a way to track
down these weird dust-eating Grimm.

58:01.479 --> 58:03.731
I've been trying to work around the CCT.

58:03.814 --> 58:06.192
It's like something shut
their whole system down

58:06.275 --> 58:09.945
just to run their sequence and prevent
us from contacting each other.

58:10.029 --> 58:12.031
But I think I've finally...

58:14.867 --> 58:17.495
[Yang] A Wyvern and a Leviathan?

58:17.870 --> 58:20.998
- They'll be killed.
- We have to go. Right now.

58:28.547 --> 58:29.924
I know you can do this.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.468
I know you can get us
out of this, Jessica!

58:32.551 --> 58:35.513
You have to fight this. For them.

58:35.596 --> 58:36.681
[action music playing]

58:39.558 --> 58:40.643
For myself.

58:49.068 --> 58:55.116
In brightest clay, in blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight!

58:55.616 --> 59:01.455
Let those who worship evil's might,
beware my power! Green Lantern's light!

59:06.877 --> 59:07.753
[Ruby grunts]

59:12.049 --> 59:13.175
How's everyone doing?

59:15.136 --> 59:16.887
Finally getting the hang of this place.

59:24.520 --> 59:25.354
Everyone else?

59:25.438 --> 59:28.482
Well, could use a coffee break.
Ice cream? Caffeine IV?

59:28.566 --> 59:31.360
- Is-- Is that--
- Running out of steam.

59:36.115 --> 59:38.451
The Wyvern seems
unlimited in creating Grimm.

59:38.534 --> 59:40.369
[Cyborg] ls this what Grimm
are normally like?

59:40.453 --> 59:42.204
I mean, they seem weird.

59:46.417 --> 59:47.710
How's Nora?

59:50.171 --> 59:51.839
Let's finish this fight first.

59:57.595 --> 59:59.597
Looks like you guys could use some help.

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:04.101
‘[RubY] Weiss!
-HUh?

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:06.520
I'm okay, Ruby.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.522
It'll take more than
a temporal displacement

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:10.357
to keep me away from my team.

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:11.901
Is that what this is?

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.489
Where's Batman?

01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.074
Let's take these guys down.

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.885
-Lantern!
-We've been trying to get to you!

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.721
- None of this is real!
- It's a virtual reality!

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:43.390
-[Cyborg] I knew it!
-So, who's doing it?

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:44.308
I...

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.434
[all] Huh?

01:00:45.518 --> 01:00:47.144
may have that answer.

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:50.898
-Batman?
-So much cooler than I thought.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:56.195
- It's good to see everyone.
- You have powers.

01:00:56.529 --> 01:00:58.072
Yeah.
[chuckles]

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.448
Got me some wings.

01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:02.868
-As to who's doing this--
-Why don't you answer...

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.328
Flash?

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:10.125
-That... That's why you smell different.
-Where's my ring?

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:11.710
Whoa.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:14.588
What are you talking about?

01:01:15.047 --> 01:01:17.299
Running this world would take
a lot of energy,

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:19.552
even with siphoning dust.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:24.890
And, Flash, you've been running slow.
Getting hurt.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:29.728
Because you're running one equation
through all the computers on this world.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.441
Ki|g%re!

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:43.784
It makes sense.

01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:47.246
Every time we would be close to answers,
there would be a new monster attack.

01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:50.207
He created all of this.

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:52.710
What did you do to Barry?

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:59.300
He's in here. Safe and sound.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:03.470
Been fun to run around with you guys
instead of from you for a change.

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:07.975
You all think you're so smart,
but you didn't think twice

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.686
about what was going
on with the Scarlet Speedster.

01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:18.319
It was so easy to trip you up
and keep you guessing.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:23.490
You may think Brainiac
or Vandal Savage are smarter than me...

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.453
but I have done what they couldn't.

01:02:29.038 --> 01:02:31.790
I have trapped the Justice League.

01:02:31.874 --> 01:02:34.877
And us.
Your plan doesn't make any sense.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.712
What kind of lame villain are you?

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:40.299
That's it. You didn't do this
on your own, did you, Ki|g%re?

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.843
Do you see anyone else here?

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:48.891
I trapped you forever
in this digital world.

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:52.853
I used their precious dust to power it.

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:58.651
Me, and no one else.

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:08.327
Then why are you still here?

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:13.123
That's why you've been running
the sequence on all systems.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.046
You're trapped, too.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:28.263
I gave him the idea to power
this realm with dust from his world.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:32.351
This construct was useless without me!

01:03:33.394 --> 01:03:37.398
But I required no payment for my genius.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.568
I simply asked to use this place.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.822
It was a perfect plan.

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:49.785
Bring my enemies into this world,
transform them into teens

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.496
so they would
be at their most vulnerable,

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.915
rife with hormones and insecurities,

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:59.044
while I watched
as this world ripped you apart.

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:03.298
And he agreed, on the condition
that I trap his enemies as well.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:07.219
I digitally transferred you all here

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:10.347
and watched you struggle
with all the emotions

01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:13.225
your adult selves ignore. Or repress.

01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:18.272
It's been said I am an electrical wire
short of a full panel.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:21.775
But you all folded so easily.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.945
[Ki|g%re chuckles]

01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:30.951
You, especially.
A child pretending to be a leader.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:32.786
[Kilg%re laughs]

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:33.954
Delicious.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:39.209
Don't listen to him, Ruby.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.421
Leadership isn't about your age.

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:44.048
It's about your heart.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:49.553
You Will fail.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:51.764
You will freeze.

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:57.061
But that's what makes you alive.

01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:05.069
You don't have a way out of this world
because whoever you worked with...

01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:07.404
they trapped you here.

01:05:10.032 --> 01:05:11.116
[Kilg%re shouts]

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:12.409
Huh...

01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:14.828
-[Weiss] Clark is right.
-Huh?

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.540
I'd follow you into any battle.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:21.001
[Batman]
That's what you got wrong, Kilg%re.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.171
That's what you don't get about humans.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.882
We're stronger together.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:30.094
Whoever helped you tricked
you into doing what they want.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:44.691
You're stuck with us.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.235
Weiss!

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.199
Barry! Now!

01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:02.334
How did you know that
Barry was awake in there?

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:05.003
I didn't. Until I noticed...

01:06:08.841 --> 01:06:11.760
Morse code?
And they call me a boy scout.

01:06:11.844 --> 01:06:14.513
-How do we get rid of him?
-[Kilg%re] You can't!

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:17.057
[Kilg%re laughs]

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:27.234
- He flew into the VVyvern!
- Well, that was unexpected.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.112
I will destroy you!

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:32.573
Vixen. Lantern.

01:06:33.282 --> 01:06:35.033
I think these belong to you.

01:06:36.285 --> 01:06:38.370
Glad I arrived just in time
for the final battle.

01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:40.205
Let's go.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.541
[action music playing]

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:54.988
[Ruby shouts]

01:08:10.045 --> 01:08:11.046
We're outnumbered!

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:14.883
We could stand a chance
if we take down Kilg%re in the dragon.

01:08:14.967 --> 01:08:16.051
-Wyvern.
-Yeah, well,

01:08:16.343 --> 01:08:18.136
the last time we tried
to take it down, it replicated.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:21.180
-Because Kilg%re was with you.
-But now he's in it.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:22.808
And with Kilg%re controlling it,

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.687
we're banging our head against
a very angry, very gruesome wall.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:30.314
If someone could get us close enough,
Jaune and I could deconstruct it.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.109
Take the Wyvern and Kilg%re apart.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:37.406
-I can try to open a path, but--
-There are too many Grimm.

01:08:39.241 --> 01:08:40.408
You got a plan, kid?

01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:45.913
I just might.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.250

01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:05.929
[action music continues]

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:18.942
Pitiful!

01:11:19.568 --> 01:11:21.194
Think we gave them enough time?

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:27.742
You got this, Lantern!

01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:29.953
She's right.

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:33.665
So long as my friends believe in me.

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:38.712
What are you doing?

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:40.755
No. No!

01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:44.885
No!

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:55.145
Good work.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:58.648
Hmm.

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:00.108
Hmm.

01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:03.195
Yeah. That's great and all,
but where's Ki|g%re?

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:04.696
Gone.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.990
His code isn't running
through the world anymore.

01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:08.492
Things feel better now.

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:10.827
We didn't completely destroy him?

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:13.330
We'll track him down on our world.

01:12:13.413 --> 01:12:15.207
I thought he was trapped with us.

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:18.752
Well, turns out Jess
has more power than she thought.

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:22.547
That's great,
but how do we get back home?

01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:24.424
I think I might have a way.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:25.884
And then what?

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:28.845
Are you going to go with them or us?

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.141
I'm a warrior,

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:35.560
no matter what world I'm in.

01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:43.610
Hey

01:12:44.152 --> 01:12:45.153
I wanted to...

01:12:45.946 --> 01:12:46.821
to say...

01:12:47.489 --> 01:12:48.323
thank you.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:51.535
To the both of you. I respect you.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:55.163
[Batman] There. That should do it.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.873
Go ahead, Cyborg.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:12:59.251
It's been an honor.

01:13:03.797 --> 01:13:04.631
What he said.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:06.550
For me, too.

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:10.679
You were right.
It's hard to grow up under fire.

01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:12.597
I forget sometimes.

01:13:13.348 --> 01:13:14.182
lguess“.

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.060
I guess that's why we fight.

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:19.771
It's not just because of how we grew up.

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:23.984
It's so no one else
has to grow up like us.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:27.362
And sometimes it's just
nice to kick ass.

01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:35.370
Lantern, you're up.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:58.268
[soft music playing]

01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:01.563
[Superman] There it is.

01:14:03.231 --> 01:14:04.065
Home.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.861
I don't know how long
I can hold it. Let's go.

01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:11.906
I'm sure it was great meeting
all of you.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:15.243
Sorry about the whole possession thing.

01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:17.245
So long, gang-

01:14:17.329 --> 01:14:19.873
If you're ever in the neighborhood,
you know where to find us.

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:45.815
You know you're still a kid, right?
Even if it's at heart.

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:49.611
Well, Ruby Rose,
I don't think it's so bad being a kid.

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.072
Age isn't what makes
a good leader, right?

01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:55.325
Right. Thanks for the reminder.

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:58.328
You're sure you got this?

01:14:58.411 --> 01:14:59.245
I got it.

01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:00.914
Thank you.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:02.248
Likewise.

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:06.795
-All right, guys. Not much longer.
-Come on, Weiss.

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:20.892
[Yang] Ruby?

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:26.856
Did anybody else just have
a really weird experience?

01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:31.569
It's coming back to me.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:35.031
That wasn't the training mission,
was it?

01:15:35.657 --> 01:15:37.367
Someone created it.

01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:41.079
Someone... from our world.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.706
