WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.220
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, friends. You'll recall Jane

00:03.264 --> 00:04.308
had been working on her newest
book for quite some time.

00:04.352 --> 00:05.527
I just had an epiphany
about my new book.

00:05.570 --> 00:08.791
I want to turn it
into this big

00:08.834 --> 00:10.401
multigenerational story

00:10.445 --> 00:12.055
with all
of the lightness

00:12.099 --> 00:13.448
and all of the darkness.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.363
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And great news:

00:15.406 --> 00:17.452
she was getting good feedback
from her mentor Marlene.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.584
I would love to show it
to a friend in the industry.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.412
Really?
That would be...Okay,

00:21.456 --> 00:24.459
okay, the friend is
actually my lover.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.417
She's in publishing,
and she's a genius.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.376
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And Marlene's not the only one
with a lover.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.595
Jane and Rafael
were back together.

00:30.639 --> 00:31.988
And he proposed.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.077
Will you marry me?Yes!

00:34.121 --> 00:35.426
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know!

00:35.470 --> 00:37.254
Heart-eye emojis, right?

00:37.298 --> 00:39.952
But in less happy news,
their son Mateo

00:39.996 --> 00:41.911
was having a hard time
at school.

00:41.954 --> 00:44.131
Mateo is really struggling
with his reading.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.437
He is quite far behind
the rest of the class.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.439
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, and Jane's dad
was struggling, too.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.789
See, the fate of his show was in the hands of the studio.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.574
Barry, I need this pickup.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.097
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know!
Straight out of a telenovela

00:54.141 --> 00:55.142
inside a telenovela!

00:55.185 --> 00:56.143
And speaking of...

00:56.186 --> 00:57.927
remember Rafael's sister Luisa?

00:57.970 --> 01:00.669
You know, the one
who was in love with Rose,

01:00.712 --> 01:02.018
aka our supervillain.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.020
Thank you for accepting
this assignment.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.848
Now let's get to work.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.806
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, Luisa swore
her off forever,

01:07.850 --> 01:09.199
though recently she seemed

01:09.243 --> 01:11.245
to have had a change
of heart again.

01:11.288 --> 01:14.335
I even sent someone
to watch over you. "Girl..."

01:14.378 --> 01:16.250
Hey, girl, what's up?I'm in.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.078
What does Rose need me to do?

01:18.121 --> 01:19.731
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, and I
hate to bring this up, but...

01:19.775 --> 01:22.386
If you do not help me,
something terrible...

01:22.430 --> 01:24.388
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know.

01:24.432 --> 01:28.479
I hope Petra's okay.
Which is where we left off.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.786
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:30.829 --> 01:33.528
was 30 years
and six months old,

01:33.571 --> 01:35.921
her life changed forever.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.575
She gonna be okay?

01:40.665 --> 01:42.928
Yes. Unfortunately.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.408
My mother's
like a cockroach.

01:44.452 --> 01:47.324
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But that's a month away.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.674
Right now Jane is 30 years
andfive months old.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.459
And this is more of a hassle.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.548
Her leg's pretty screwed up.
She'll be fine.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.594
I'm just happy
you're all right.

01:56.638 --> 02:01.947
You know, when I first
woke up after the crash,

02:01.991 --> 02:03.732
my first thought
was of the girls.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.864
What if I died?

02:05.908 --> 02:07.518
Then I realized
they'd be fine.

02:07.562 --> 02:08.519
'Cause they have Rafael.

02:08.563 --> 02:11.522
And you. As a stepmom.Oh...

02:11.566 --> 02:13.524
Don't you start crying.
I'm trying to stop...

02:13.568 --> 02:14.656
Too late.

02:14.699 --> 02:18.007
I just realized
I'm gonna be a stepmom.

02:18.050 --> 02:22.011
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.230
What's going on?

02:23.273 --> 02:25.275
I want to make sure
everything is equal,

02:25.319 --> 02:27.364
so the girls feel every bit
as important as Mateo.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.844
I also think

02:28.887 --> 02:30.193
we should buy two more chairs
for the kitchen table,

02:30.237 --> 02:31.716
so they don't have
to sit on folding chairs

02:31.760 --> 02:33.457
every time they come over,
like they're company.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.545
And I'm gonna spend time

02:34.589 --> 02:36.068
with each of them separately

02:36.112 --> 02:38.201
to really get
to know them individually.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.594
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And learn to tell them apart.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.465
That sounds great,
but where is this coming from?

02:41.509 --> 02:42.640
We're getting married.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.076
I'm taking on a new role

02:44.120 --> 02:45.208
in their life.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.731
And I want to kill
this stepmom thing.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.777
Ooh!

02:50.387 --> 02:52.868
Oh! Oh, my God!

02:52.911 --> 02:54.696
I just realized what I have
to do to fix my novel.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.654
I-I've been trying to crack
this chapter,

02:56.698 --> 02:57.655
and I finally figured it out.

02:57.699 --> 02:58.874
I have to rearrange everything.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.397
I need to go write!

03:00.441 --> 03:02.312
Go! Go write!Oh!

03:02.356 --> 03:03.966
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so write she did.

03:04.009 --> 03:09.101
Because when the muse struck
Jane, it struck her hard.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.451
Pretty much punched her
in the face.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.756
Shehad to write.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.280
She couldn't stop.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.238
Though life didn't stop
around her.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.587
Hey, good news.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.198
Petra regained some mobility
in her fingers.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.503
She even flipped me off
this morning.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.250
I just heard
the studio loved

03:27.294 --> 03:28.469
our This Is Marspilot.

03:28.512 --> 03:29.818
You want to come to dinner
and celebrate?

03:29.861 --> 03:31.428
Oh, Dad, I would love to,
but I am on such a roll.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.474
Then keep rolling,
my brilliant daughter.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.695
Oh, wow.
It's sort of smelly in here.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.220
Still in the zone.
Stay there.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.483
I just need to borrow
your label maker.

03:42.526 --> 03:45.137
I'm organizing
my nursing school courses.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.704
I just registered.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.271
This is so good.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.968
Okay. I got to go
pick up the kids,

03:50.012 --> 03:52.710
but I'll read the next chapter
as soon as I get back.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.930
Thank you. Love you.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.071
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And finally... after
three weeks, five pizzas,

04:06.115 --> 04:10.032
and one and a half showers,
Jane finished her novel.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.990
Hallelujah!

04:24.916 --> 04:29.051
Ah... it's awesome.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.879
I love-- What?
What's this?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.228
Uh, my alternate ending.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.144
Let me know which one
you think is better.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.450
Uh, what's
the difference?

04:36.493 --> 04:38.321
That comma.
It completely changes

04:38.365 --> 04:39.453
the cadence of
the last sentence.

04:39.496 --> 04:42.934
Okay, I vote
no comma.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.459
Actually, I might go
with the comma.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.809
Okay. It's done.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.290
Period.
Exclamation point.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.900
Now go send it
to Jill.

04:51.943 --> 04:52.988
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jill.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.077
Marlene's publishing friend.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.078
And lover.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.297
Okay. Yeah.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.387
It's good, right?

05:00.430 --> 05:02.258
I think it's good.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.346
But I also feel
strange saying that,

05:03.390 --> 05:04.608
like, maybe I'm delusional.

05:04.652 --> 05:08.090
You're not. It's better
than good. It's great.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.356
Now go take a shower.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.401
It's time.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.234
Have you heard anything
about your manuscript?

05:22.278 --> 05:23.540
Not yet.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.542
I'm spiraling.
Please don't ask me about it.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.544
Okay, well, yesterday you
got mad because I didn'task.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.503
Yes, I know.
Like I said, I'm spiraling.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.069
Wh-What's going on?
Distract me.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.854
Can you take the girls
for a few hours today?

05:32.897 --> 05:34.725
Raf's showing a house.
I've got back-to-back meetings,

05:34.769 --> 05:36.727
and the nannies have
some god-awful stomach virus,

05:36.771 --> 05:38.381
so they're banned
from the Marbella.
Of course.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.253
Yes! I am officially ready
to step into stepmomming.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.386
Great. So can I just go over
a few rules

05:43.430 --> 05:44.779
I've developed
with their therapist?

05:44.822 --> 05:45.867
Mother-to-stepmother
communication.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.912
I love it.
Give me those rules.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.697
Most of it's just common sense.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.699
And only one sweet
per day.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.875
Unless it's Friday. Then they
can have an apple and a sweet.

05:53.918 --> 05:54.963
But only afterdinner.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.051
And no cheese puffs ever.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.052
I found little orange
fingerprints

05:57.095 --> 05:58.270
all over my Prada mules.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.315
Is that it?Yes.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.751
Why? Do you need
more guidance?

06:00.795 --> 06:02.231
No. God, no.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.146
Look, all these
boundaries and rules

06:04.189 --> 06:05.669
make them feel safe
and loved.

06:05.713 --> 06:06.931
Because if they don't,

06:06.975 --> 06:08.933
they get manipulative
and start to lie.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.021
And their therapist
said we need

06:10.065 --> 06:11.283
to nip that behavior
in the bud.

06:11.327 --> 06:12.633
Got it.
No problem.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.548
Thank you so much.My pleasure!

06:14.591 --> 06:17.812
I'm going to finish my shift
and get ready to stepmom it up.

06:21.642 --> 06:22.860
What are you doing?

06:22.904 --> 06:24.514
I'm stepmomming it up!

06:24.558 --> 06:26.429
You're so weird.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.780
Yes, hello.

06:29.824 --> 06:32.130
This is Dr. Price,
your mother's physician.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.523
We need you down here ASAP.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.395
It's fine. You have
my permission to pull the plug.

06:35.438 --> 06:38.746
Ma'am, your mother's
not on life support.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.964
What was that?

06:40.008 --> 06:41.923
DR. PRICE:
She just threw another bedpan.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.446
We really need you
down here.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.187
Just put her on the phone.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.710
MAGDA:
I won't let them do it!

06:46.754 --> 06:49.409
In Czech Republic,
they put you under.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.976
Next thing you know, your
kidneys are being auctioned off

06:52.020 --> 06:53.282
on black market.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.805
Mother, what are you
talking about?

06:54.849 --> 06:58.156
Doctor say I must cut off leg
or die.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.203
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, how many appendages
can this lady lose?

07:01.246 --> 07:02.987
Really taking her down
to the studs here.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.989
Well, I don't know, Mother,
maybe roll the dice.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.991
EXECUTIVE:
We don't want to gamble
on this pilot.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.776
That's why we're
testing it

07:08.819 --> 07:10.342
before we send it
to the network.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.953
RIVER:
So how does this work?

07:11.996 --> 07:12.954
Uh, I'm not familiar

07:12.997 --> 07:14.651
with the pilot
testing process,

07:14.695 --> 07:16.479
because my shows always go
straight to series.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.567
When they
like something,

07:17.611 --> 07:18.742
they turn the dial up.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.004
When they dislike
something,

07:20.048 --> 07:21.049
they turn
the dial down.

07:23.312 --> 07:27.316
I told you never to interrupt me
while I'm executive producing.

07:27.359 --> 07:30.667
I was just bringing you
the coffees you asked for.Never.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.800
All right, but I will take
the coffee, since it's here.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.018
Thank you, Girl Rudy.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.498
Take me, Steve.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.850
What does that mean?

07:39.894 --> 07:41.199
Looks like the women
in the audience

07:41.243 --> 07:43.637
love the romance.
And as predicted,

07:43.680 --> 07:45.856
the men aren't as interested
in the soapy stuff.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.075
BRENDA:
The doctor,

07:47.118 --> 07:49.381
he might come back.Then let him watch.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.296
Take off your shirt.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.950
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. Straight men like boobs.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.691
Pilot-testing seems
like an airtight method.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.781
Our scientists have finally
figured out...

07:57.825 --> 07:59.957
Oh, I love this scene.Oh, me, too.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.307
We're perfectly
calibrated.

08:03.787 --> 08:07.574
Excuse me, can you check to see
if the dials are broken?

08:09.750 --> 08:13.057
Oh, thank God.
Never mind.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.407
Our passionate lovemaking
has healed my wounds.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.801
STEVE:
Who needs doctors?

08:17.845 --> 08:21.239
EXECUTIVE:
Great test. We're really happy.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.415
I'd change a
few music cues.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Got it.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.592
And then let's get it over to
the network for the weekend.

08:25.635 --> 08:26.810
Sounds good.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.337
That was a disaster.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.252
What are you
talking about?

08:34.296 --> 08:35.993
The test scores
were through the roof.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.866
For those two fetuses,
not for us.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.215
If the network
sees these scores,

08:40.258 --> 08:42.434
they're gonna want to
make the show all about

08:42.478 --> 08:44.828
those two mildly
talented Mini-Me's

08:44.872 --> 08:46.526
and we're gonna
get sidelined.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.788
What?Yes.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.180
Well, that
can't happen.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.618
This is ourshow. We're
the stars.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.445
Exactly. So we're gonna go back
into editing

08:53.489 --> 08:55.186
and make sure we stand out more.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.448
Otherwise, they're
gonna turn us into

08:56.492 --> 08:58.363
side characters whose scenes get

08:58.407 --> 08:59.800
shorter and shorter,
until they're

08:59.843 --> 09:01.149
cutting us off mid...

09:01.192 --> 09:04.631
Some mandarin oranges
for your Mandarin homework.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.589
We're actually done
with our homework.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.505
Yeah. Can we have
20 minutes of iPad time?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.552
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which one of Petra's 800 rules
covered that?

09:12.595 --> 09:16.251
Well, uh... just give me
a minute to think about that.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.433
Hey, are you
texting our mom?

09:24.476 --> 09:26.609
What? No.
Of course not.

09:26.653 --> 09:30.308
I'm just, uh...
considering the request.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.223
You know... weighing
the pros and cons.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.485
Really deliberating.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.618
I think it was,
um, Henry David Thoreau

09:35.662 --> 09:38.142
who said, "To live
deliberately,

09:38.186 --> 09:41.276
to front only the essential
facts of life..."

09:46.020 --> 09:49.719
Anyway, after much
deliberation, the answer is no.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.808
Okay. We'll just
go play in our room.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.333
Oh.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.598
Marlene?

09:58.641 --> 09:59.816
Jane, hi.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
Listen, I loved your novel.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.603
Oh, my God. Really?

10:03.646 --> 10:05.126
Yes, it totally delivered.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.041
It's as amazing
as I knew it would be.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.172
Thank you.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.827
Uh, that's great to hear.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.612
But unfortunately, Jill

10:12.655 --> 10:15.745
passed on it. She's not
going to represent you.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.577
It means that my novel
was rejected, Abuela.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.362
The agent doesn't want
to represent me.

10:24.406 --> 10:25.581
But you know what?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.365
I'm actually fine,
optimistic even.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.150
According to Marlene,

10:29.193 --> 10:32.066
Jill loved the writing but just
didn't know how to market it,

10:32.109 --> 10:35.199
which means that she just
wasn't the right fit for me,

10:35.243 --> 10:37.680
but there are plenty
of other agents out there,

10:37.724 --> 10:39.116
and I'm going to get
my manuscript

10:39.160 --> 10:41.553
to every last one of them.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.598
Abuela?

10:47.603 --> 10:49.126
No, I'm printing,

10:49.170 --> 10:51.651
and I have to keep printing,
so I'll call you later.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.523
Love you.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.877
Hey. What's going on?

11:01.791 --> 11:05.186
BOTH:
Hey, Aunt Jane.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.796
Don't "hey, Aunt Jane" me.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.842
You're playing with your iPad
when I specifically told you

11:08.885 --> 11:10.539
that you couldn't.
Now hand them over.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.672
Sorry.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.978
It won't happen again.

11:15.022 --> 11:18.547
Okay, then, but you don't
get 'em after dinner. Deal?

11:18.590 --> 11:20.723
Deal.

11:20.767 --> 11:21.985
Do you have shrimp cocktail?

11:22.029 --> 11:26.511
Maybe with a side of soy-braised
baby back ribs?

11:26.555 --> 11:27.774
I have chicken nuggets.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.514
Low-sodium at least?

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
Absolutely.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.170
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Look at that.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.346
Super Stepmom in the house.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.826
PETRA:
Everything go okay
with the girls?

11:36.870 --> 11:39.002
Yeah. For the most part,
it was smooth sailing.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.700
Wh-What do you mean
"for the most part"?

11:40.743 --> 11:43.180
Well, we did have a minor issue,
but I handled it.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.400
What happened? I need
to know all the details.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.184
It's important.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.884
Okay, but please don't
tell them that I told you

11:50.927 --> 11:52.886
because we're really
starting to bond.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.714
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also bonding...

11:54.757 --> 11:57.586
Okay, girl, let's go over
the details one more time.

11:57.629 --> 12:01.198
Oh, don't worry, I've got it.
I'm just gonna go to Rafael,

12:01.242 --> 12:03.287
and I'm gonna beg him
for the tie tack.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.419
Simple pimple.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.247
Exactly.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.771
I wish I could do it.
If I could, I would.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.817
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in fact, he tried.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.823
No problem.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.782
But why does Rose want
the tie tack? Do you know?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.349
One step at a time.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.612
But she does have
a plan, right?

12:23.655 --> 12:25.962
Rose always has a plan,

12:26.006 --> 12:28.486
and the tie tack is phase two.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.795
ROGELIO: Pause!

12:32.839 --> 12:35.102
Okay, that was
a very sexy scream,

12:35.145 --> 12:37.060
but there was
a slight downward turn

12:37.104 --> 12:39.628
in the corners of River's mouth
at the end of the shot.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.325
Totally true.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.763
Can we trim off about
two and a half frames?

12:43.806 --> 12:45.721
Well, yeah, sure, but, look,

12:45.765 --> 12:48.289
if you guys want me to tweak
every single frame,

12:48.332 --> 12:49.594
we'll be here all night.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.726
Good point, Mia.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.381
Let's check in with
our loved ones

12:53.424 --> 12:54.991
and tell them it's
gonna be an all-nighter.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.601
Geez...

12:56.645 --> 12:59.039
What is it, Rogelio? We're
seeing you in less than an hour.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.217
ROGELIO: Darci, listen,
what is the one thing

13:03.260 --> 13:05.436
in the world
you love more than Baby?

13:05.480 --> 13:06.437
When you owe me a favor.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.612
Exactly.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.701
And, boy, am I gonna
owe you a big one.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.442
I'm on a time crunch at work.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.183
Can we pretty please
swap Baby days?

13:13.227 --> 13:14.445
Again?

13:14.489 --> 13:16.621
Esteban is going on
a yoga retreat tomorrow,

13:16.665 --> 13:18.275
and tonight
was couples time.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.450
Darci, please,

13:19.494 --> 13:21.757
my pilot hangs in the balance.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.628
Fine,

13:23.672 --> 13:25.761
but I'm not gonna forget
about this favor.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.241
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
Thank Esteban,

13:27.284 --> 13:28.546
and tell Baby I love her.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.549
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rogelio is such a...

13:31.593 --> 13:33.508
Ah, ah, ah.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.776
JANE:
Crap.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.778
What's wrong?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.649
Uh...

13:44.693 --> 13:46.303
just got another
rejection letter.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.131
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, it's 7:00 a.m.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.612
Let the girl have
a cup of coffee first.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.832
I'm sorry.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.138
I can get off work early
and pick up the girls

13:55.182 --> 13:56.313
so you don't have to.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.620
No, no, no, life goes on,

13:58.663 --> 14:01.449
and I still have plenty
of agents to hear from,

14:01.492 --> 14:05.366
and me and the girls
are making real progress.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.671
You tattled on us!

14:06.715 --> 14:07.847
ELLIE:
That's so lame.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.762
New name:
Lame Jane.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.417
No, stop.Stop what, Lame Jane?

14:13.461 --> 14:15.245
I only told your mother
what happened

14:15.289 --> 14:17.334
because we're all on one team.

14:17.378 --> 14:20.207
Team twins, huh? Go team!

14:20.250 --> 14:21.425
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yikes.

14:21.469 --> 14:22.905
Pretty lame, Jane.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.602
Snitches get stitches.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.430
And end up
in ditches.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.389
We don't hang out with narcs.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.392
What... Hey, no, girls,
come back here right now.

14:31.435 --> 14:34.351
Um, excuse me.Stop it!

14:34.395 --> 14:36.179
My luggage!

14:36.223 --> 14:38.878
Wh-- Are you
their nanny?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.618
You need to get
control of them.

14:40.662 --> 14:43.404
Just because I'm Latina doesn't
mean that I'm their nanny.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.797
Yeah, she's
not our nanny.
Huh.

14:45.841 --> 14:49.279
She's our evil stepmother,
and we hate her.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.637
Hurry up and get ready for
dinner, girls. So how was it?

14:59.681 --> 15:02.118
Well, not great.What happened?

15:02.162 --> 15:04.555
What happened is that you
told them what I told you,

15:04.599 --> 15:06.209
and now they think
I'm a big tattletale.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.690
NARRATOR: In their defense,
you're tattling right now.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.953
Who cares? This isn't
middle school, it's parenting.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.433
You said you weren't
gonna say anything.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.652
Well, I changed my mind,
because I'm their mother,

15:14.696 --> 15:16.741
and it's my job to decide
what's best for them.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.221
And, frankly, you
shouldn't have asked me

15:18.265 --> 15:20.789
not to say something in
the first place. Got it?

15:20.832 --> 15:22.834
Fine. Okay. Got it.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.880
Thank you.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.969
So any incidents
to report today?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.974
Yes, we did
have an issue.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.890
They ran away because
they were upset with me.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.066
Thank you.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.763
Girls, get out here!
Jane told me what you did!

15:38.807 --> 15:41.723
NARRATOR: And speaking
of fractured relationships.

15:41.766 --> 15:44.987
Whatever you have to say, I
don't want to hear it. Just go.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.598
Wait, wait, wait! I understand
how you feel and why.

15:47.642 --> 15:50.950
And after this, I will
leave you alone forever.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.169
But I have
no family left,

15:53.213 --> 15:56.520
and I just wanted

15:56.564 --> 15:59.001
something small of Dad's
before I go.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.047
What is it?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.701
It's this

16:03.745 --> 16:06.052
gold and onyx tie tack.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.662
It's not worth much,

16:07.705 --> 16:10.012
but it's got
sentimental value to me.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.667
Dad wore it to my
med school graduation,

16:12.710 --> 16:14.538
and I could...

16:14.582 --> 16:17.585
I could really use a reminder
of a time in my life

16:17.628 --> 16:20.196
when I was worthy of my family's
love and respect.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.329
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, wow, she's good.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.853
I got it.

16:24.896 --> 16:28.552
Well, I, um,
I have the tie tack,

16:28.596 --> 16:30.032
so you know what I'll do?

16:30.076 --> 16:32.382
What?Take it straight to the police,

16:32.426 --> 16:33.905
because if you
want it, then it

16:33.949 --> 16:35.733
probably has something
to do with Rose.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.735
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, wow, guess he's better.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.781
Raf, please, don't.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.379
ROGELIO:
Push in on that look.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.035
Now pull out on both of us.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.476
RIVER: Oh, my God,
we look amazing.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.086
We're popping
so much.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.437
We're like a thousand champagne
corks exploding at once.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.656
And we're done.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.919
Okay, now let's
send this new tape

17:30.962 --> 17:33.400
to the studio to get
to the network. Girl Rudy,

17:33.443 --> 17:36.142
we need you to get the new cut
to the studio ASAP.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.318
Oh, I already did.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.102
What are you
talking about?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.235
The network said
it had to be in by 3:00,

17:42.278 --> 17:44.280
so the studio told me
to deliver the latest cut.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.934
Why didn't you
tell me that?

17:45.977 --> 17:47.718
You said never to interrupt you
when you're executive producing.

17:47.762 --> 17:48.980
ROGELIO: Call the
network right now

17:49.024 --> 17:50.765
and tell them that a new cut
is on the way.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.420
I can't. They're at a corporate
retreat and unreachable.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.075
That's why it needed
to be in by 3:00.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.382
That makes three.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.341
Three rejections just today.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.603
Hey, it only takes one, right?

18:02.646 --> 18:04.692
That's what I keep
telling myself,

18:04.735 --> 18:07.042
but I think I need
one of Dad's famous

18:07.086 --> 18:08.435
"fight for your art" pep talks.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.306
Ah!Oh, good, you're home.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.960
Rogelio, tell Jane
what it's like

18:12.003 --> 18:13.875
finally getting to work
on your passion project.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.137
Oh.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.182
Sure. Well, it's,

18:16.225 --> 18:17.835
uh, horrible.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.881
My career is over.
I might as well quit.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.361
Why?

18:21.404 --> 18:23.363
Because your daughter
needs a pep talk.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.842
She got a few more
rejection letters.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.670
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.324
You have to believe
in yourself, Jane.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.370
That is the most
important thing.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.328
The crazy thing is,
is I actually do.

18:32.372 --> 18:35.201
I think that there is an agent
out there who will love my book,

18:35.244 --> 18:37.290
but my manuscript's not even
getting to their desks.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.293
How do you know?I worked in publishing.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.208
I'm getting form letter
rejections from assistants.

18:42.251 --> 18:45.733
The last one was addressed
to "Jake Villanuts."

18:47.256 --> 18:50.346
H-Have you
heard back from everyone?

18:50.390 --> 18:53.088
Well, not Isabel
Allende's agent,

18:53.132 --> 18:56.047
but there's no way that my book
is getting even near her.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.354
Unless you get it near her.

18:58.398 --> 19:02.097
Did I ever tell you
how I got this scar?

19:02.141 --> 19:05.405
I'll make some tea. Remember
your health, Rogelio. Keep calm.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.494
Of course.
I'm perfectly calm.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.104
So, calmly.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.150
When I was a young actor
in Mexico City,

19:11.193 --> 19:14.631
Alejandro González Iñárritu was
directing a movie about a hobo

19:14.675 --> 19:16.111
who through sheer handsomeness

19:16.155 --> 19:19.419
becomes the richest
oil tycoon in the world.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.595
So I dressed as a homeless man

19:21.638 --> 19:25.251
and waited along the route
Iñárritu took every day to work.

19:25.294 --> 19:28.167
Then I saw his car,
so I ran into traffic

19:28.210 --> 19:30.038
with a bucket and a squeegee.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.605
That's how
you got your scar?

19:31.648 --> 19:33.607
You got hit by a car
while method auditioning?

19:33.650 --> 19:35.435
No.

19:35.478 --> 19:39.265
Iñárritu didn't recognize me and
threatened to call the police.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.701
But I didn't give up.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.790
The next day,
I went to Iñárritu's house

19:42.833 --> 19:46.010
and hand-delivered my headshot
to Iñárritu's girlfriend.

19:46.054 --> 19:49.449
She was very nice
and invited me inside.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.494
Then one thing led to another,

19:51.538 --> 19:53.975
and let's just say that
when Iñárritu got home,

19:54.018 --> 19:55.629
I had to jump out the window.

19:55.672 --> 19:56.978
And that's how
you got your scar?

19:57.021 --> 20:00.024
No. I'm incredibly agile
and landed on my feet,

20:00.068 --> 20:03.463
right in the middle
of Iñárritu's guard dogs.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.508
So you were bitten?
No.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.989
I used my incredible cunning
and a little hypnosis

20:08.032 --> 20:09.686
and got away, and then Iñárritu

20:09.730 --> 20:11.471
found my headshot
under his pillow.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.516
And then you got the part?No.

20:13.560 --> 20:17.477
Actually, Iñárritu banned me
from his sets for life.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.261
But the rumor
of our feud

20:19.305 --> 20:21.785
got a ton of coverage
in the Mexican tabloids,

20:21.829 --> 20:23.134
and all of
that attention

20:23.178 --> 20:26.094
got me an audition for
The Passions of Santos,

20:26.137 --> 20:29.010
which then launched my career.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.839
So you see, Jane,
when you have a dream,

20:31.882 --> 20:33.710
you never give up.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.756
So how did you get the scar?

20:35.799 --> 20:37.845
Oh, oh--

20:37.888 --> 20:40.326
I cut myself
while framing an issue

20:40.369 --> 20:42.241
of People en Español
about the scandal.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.896
Well, it was the first time
I saw my name in print.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.203
I still remember the headline.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.728
"Crazed D-Lister
Stalks Iñárritu."

20:53.556 --> 20:55.906
The point is,
I didn't throw in the towel

20:55.950 --> 20:57.343
when things got hard.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.040
Hmm. Dad, you
just came in here

20:59.083 --> 21:00.433
and said you
were giving up,

21:00.476 --> 21:01.782
that your
career was over.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.827
Well, I was wrong.
I'm not giving up.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.829
And neither will you,
Jake Villanuts.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.570
Now tell me.

21:07.614 --> 21:08.919
How badly do you want

21:08.963 --> 21:10.443
your manuscript
read by this agent?

21:10.486 --> 21:12.836
I want it with
everything that I am.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.795
Well, that's all
I needed to hear.

21:14.838 --> 21:17.145
I have a plan.I am not going
to break into

21:17.188 --> 21:19.278
the agent's house and put my
manuscript under her pillow.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.760
Okay then. I have a plan B.

21:29.505 --> 21:30.767
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Planning
a covert operation requires

21:30.811 --> 21:32.029
stealth and discipline and...

21:32.073 --> 21:35.729
Moo shu pork, yum.
That was fantastic.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.557
Okay. Let's synchronize
our watches.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.862
And go over the plan
one more time.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.647
The agent leaves

21:40.690 --> 21:43.693
at 5:00 p.m. on Fridays
with her weekend reading.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.087
At 4:40, you're gonna
enter the building

21:46.130 --> 21:48.132
disguised
as a delivery person.And I tell security,

21:48.176 --> 21:49.830
"I have a package
for the fifth floor."

21:49.873 --> 21:51.484
At 4:48, you're gonna enter
the agent's office

21:51.527 --> 21:53.224
and you're gonna use
your decoy box

21:53.268 --> 21:54.878
to knock over
the stack of manuscripts.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.619
And as I help pick
up the fallen papers,

21:56.663 --> 21:58.360
I slide my manuscript
on the top of her pile

21:58.404 --> 22:00.101
for her weekend reading.By the end of the day,

22:00.144 --> 22:01.929
the agent takes
your novel home. Boom.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.234
Dad, you are amazing.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.627
But the mission
isn't accomplished yet.

22:04.671 --> 22:05.976
To make it happen
by the weekend,

22:06.020 --> 22:07.282
we have to move quickly.Mm-hmm.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.547
Rudy!
Get me props, stat.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.723
I also need wardrobe
and makeup.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.159
My daughter needs
a great disguise.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.465
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.728
That's a really great disguise.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.774
Did Rogelio call
Rose's mask maker?

22:20.817 --> 22:22.123
Oh.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.342
There she is.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.604
Hey.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.302
Hey. Uh, I booked
a last-minute showing

22:27.346 --> 22:29.652
that I need to be at,
like, five minutes ago.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.612
And I know I said I would
pick up the girls, but I can't.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.483
And the nanny's still sick
and Petra's in a meeting

22:34.527 --> 22:36.267
and I should really be
in there with her and I...

22:36.311 --> 22:37.617
It's just, uh,

22:37.660 --> 22:39.488
I'm kind of in the middle
of a business thing.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.664
Wait, what business thing? A none-of-your-business thing.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.145
Nothing, never mind,
I'll pick up the girls.

22:44.188 --> 22:47.104
No, Jane. What about the plan? ROGELIO: Don't worry.

22:47.148 --> 22:49.759
I've got one. Our cut
needs to get to the network.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.979
We've worked too hard to get
this project off the ground.

22:52.022 --> 22:53.154
My younger self
would not

22:53.197 --> 22:54.634
have given up
and neither will I.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.810
Agreed. But what
does that have to do

22:56.853 --> 22:58.594
with... those hideous things?

22:58.638 --> 23:00.683
I found out
that every year

23:00.727 --> 23:02.642
the network execs
watch all their pilots

23:02.685 --> 23:04.034
at a remote
wilderness lodge.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.080
No phones,
no computers.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.343
No audience testing. But how will they know

23:08.387 --> 23:09.692
that straight men like boobs?

23:09.736 --> 23:12.216
It's just the top brass
in a screening room.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.566
Totally off the grid.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.610
But...

23:14.654 --> 23:16.177
here's the grid.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.048
The lodge is here...

23:18.092 --> 23:19.920
surrounded by some swamp.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.574
So we'll need
waders and camouflage

23:21.617 --> 23:23.358
fishing vests.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.883
The waders will help us to safely traverse the terrain.

23:26.927 --> 23:30.321
And the fishing vests will have pockets for all our needs.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.759
I wanted to get us self-destructing burner phones,

23:32.802 --> 23:35.283
but Rudy said those
aren't real, so I just got us

23:35.326 --> 23:38.852
regular boring burner phones.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.419
We will wade in
through the swamp,

23:40.462 --> 23:41.898
slip into
the screening room

23:41.942 --> 23:43.987
while they're at lunch,
swap out the tape

23:44.031 --> 23:46.729
and no one will ever know.
Are you in?

23:46.773 --> 23:48.557
There is no way in hell
she's gonna...

23:48.601 --> 23:50.211
I am so in.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.604
Wow. Okay.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.345
We cannot let them
keep on shifting

23:54.389 --> 23:56.783
the focus younger
and younger and younger.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.480
What are we doing here?JANE: I just have

23:58.524 --> 24:00.830
to make a quick delivery
and then we'll be out of here.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.092
What kind of delivery?

24:02.136 --> 24:04.312
Are you a secret
drug runner?

24:04.355 --> 24:07.489
No. No, I just... just my book.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.665
And I've been working on it
for the past year.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.624
Actually, years.
I've worked on it for years

24:11.667 --> 24:13.539
and I need to get it
to somebody to read it.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.410
Then what's with
the off-brand polo?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.846
You look like a caddy.

24:16.890 --> 24:19.066
It's complicated. And I know

24:19.109 --> 24:20.894
you're still mad at me
for tattling,

24:20.937 --> 24:23.070
but right now I need you both
to be on your best behavior.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.246
What's in it for us?

24:25.289 --> 24:26.987
Here's the thing:

24:27.030 --> 24:28.554
nothing is in it for you.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.077
Because you don't
do something for someone

24:30.120 --> 24:31.426
just to get something.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.036
I'm asking you

24:33.080 --> 24:35.430
for your help
as your future stepmom

24:35.474 --> 24:37.084
who loves you.

24:38.215 --> 24:39.869
We need to hurry. Please.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.001
Just act natural.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.090
Delivery lady.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.266
Just, uh,
making some deliveries.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.529
Per the yuj. What up?

24:47.573 --> 24:49.662
Yeah, very natural, Jane.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.447
Okay, you stay here

24:52.491 --> 24:53.753
and, uh, hide
behind that plant

24:53.796 --> 24:55.537
while I take
a delivery box.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.930
Shoot, the box.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.235
Left it in the car.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.759
Uh, it's fine.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.848
I-I can go get it.ELLIE: Why do you need a box?

25:01.891 --> 25:04.938
Because she's pretending
to be a delivery person

25:04.981 --> 25:06.461
to get past security.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.289
Obvi.GUARD:
Excuse me, ma'am.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.856
Can I help you? Uh-oh.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.206
Looks like this plan
is set to self-destruct

25:12.249 --> 25:13.990
in three, two, one.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.693
What is your business here?Lose the badge.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.913
Excuse me?
Don't you know

25:23.957 --> 25:25.872
who our mother is?

25:25.915 --> 25:28.004
ELLIE:
Anna and Ellie Beedham.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.659
Her assistant said
she was calling ahead.

25:30.703 --> 25:32.574
She is so fired.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.184
So fired.GUARD:
Wait, stop.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.359
Let's not fire anyone.

25:35.403 --> 25:36.578
It could
have been me.

25:36.622 --> 25:37.927
Now, what floor did
you say you're going to?

25:37.971 --> 25:40.277
The 26th. Beedham.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.757
And you are?

25:46.414 --> 25:48.068
I'm their nanny.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.417
Got it.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.551
Thank you

25:52.594 --> 25:54.204
so much, girls,
that was amazing.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.858
A-And real quick--

25:55.902 --> 25:57.730
it's okay that I told him
that I was your nanny

25:57.773 --> 25:59.558
because I was using
his bias against him.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.864
So it was subversive. Huh?
Do you know what that means?

26:01.908 --> 26:03.562
Of course we do.We're not idiots.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.044
What the hell are you wearing?

26:08.088 --> 26:10.481
Oh, I'm trying on clothes.

26:10.525 --> 26:11.961
F-For a work thing.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.833
What are you doing here?

26:13.876 --> 26:15.748
I'm on my way to New York.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.315
Two of my clients
are on the brink of divorce

26:18.359 --> 26:20.187
so I have to do an emergency
counseling session

26:20.230 --> 26:21.754
and Esteban is away.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.844
So I need you to take
Baby for the next two days.Oh.

26:24.887 --> 26:27.847
Oh, but I-I-I,
I-I have a, a-a very

26:27.890 --> 26:29.675
big... And totally insane...

26:29.718 --> 26:32.329
...work thing, yeah.
The fate of my show hangs...

26:32.373 --> 26:33.853
Rogelio.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.419
I just covered your ass

26:35.463 --> 26:37.030
and now I need you
to cover mine.

26:37.073 --> 26:38.640
You said it yourself.
You owe me.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.599
Prioritize your daughter.

26:40.642 --> 26:41.861
I do prioritize her.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.558
No, you haven't been lately.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.300
You've been
prioritizing work.

26:46.343 --> 26:48.432
These are the moments, Rogelio.

26:48.476 --> 26:49.999
You won't get them back.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.784
Baby won't be a baby forever.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.829
Of course I'll take her.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.222
Thank you.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.398
And, uh, a little advice.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.704
Whatever Duck Dynasty

26:58.747 --> 27:00.662
is offering, it's not worth it;
you look absurd.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.925
Wha...

27:02.969 --> 27:05.667
I know.

27:05.711 --> 27:09.192
The idea that I could
look absurd is absurd. Mwah.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.108
Yeah.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.762
River?

27:13.806 --> 27:15.285
There has been
a change of plans.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.854
Wait, what happened
with their plan?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.647
I can't
believe that worked!

27:28.690 --> 27:30.692
Oh, yay. Did you see that?

27:30.736 --> 27:32.520
I just put the manuscript
right on top of the pile.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.653
We'll lie for you
any time, Aunt Jane.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.004
Okay--

27:38.047 --> 27:39.962
Wait, I--  Uh...

27:40.006 --> 27:43.487
I-I did that because
it was a last resort.

27:43.531 --> 27:45.664
But that was wrong
and I really shouldn't

27:45.707 --> 27:47.361
have lied and pretended
to be somebody else

27:47.404 --> 27:49.668
and I definitely shouldn't
have dragged you into this.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.104
So...

27:51.147 --> 27:54.847
as punishment,
I get no iPad for a week.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.979
I'm serious.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.807
And I want you both
to enforce it.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.504
If you catch me
even looking at one,

28:00.548 --> 28:01.810
I want you to take it away.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.728
I really hope that agent
reads your book.

28:06.772 --> 28:09.209
Yeah. Me, too.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.429
Mm.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.911
I think...

28:15.955 --> 28:17.913
this is it.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.480
My last shot.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.831
What?

28:22.875 --> 28:25.442
If the agent
likes my book...

28:25.486 --> 28:28.141
She will.
I hope so.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.186
That would be...

28:30.230 --> 28:32.058
everything.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.016
But if not...

28:34.060 --> 28:36.236
then I need to move on.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.933
To the next chapter of my life.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.630
You mean, give up writing?

28:39.674 --> 28:41.981
Not give up.
Just...

28:42.024 --> 28:44.766
look at it
more like a hobby,

28:44.810 --> 28:46.333
less of a career.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.510
That feels like
giving up.
No.

28:49.553 --> 28:52.774
No, it feels like
I'm being realistic.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.168
I mean, my dad
guaranteed my last book.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.735
And with this one...

28:56.778 --> 28:58.737
I mean...

28:58.780 --> 29:00.477
I'm proud
of what I wrote.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.697
It's what
I wanted to write.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.568
But if I can't sell it,

29:04.612 --> 29:06.527
then I need to find
another way to make money.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.181
And contribute.
And leave the Marbella,

29:08.224 --> 29:10.226
which I always say
I will,

29:10.270 --> 29:11.706
but I keep ending up
back there

29:11.750 --> 29:13.577
and I want
to get out so badly.

29:13.621 --> 29:14.883
Yeah, I get that.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.756
I just hope she
loves your book.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.846
Yeah. Me, too.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.381
Which brings us, friends,
to the morning

29:34.424 --> 29:37.427
when Jane turned 30 years
and six months old.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.387
The day her life
changed forever.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.920
Good morning.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.924
Isabel Allende's agent
read my book...

29:55.968 --> 29:58.709
and she passed.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.407
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.104
You okay?

30:02.148 --> 30:04.280
It's just, uh...

30:04.324 --> 30:06.892
I kept reminding myself
how hard it was

30:06.935 --> 30:08.371
to get out of the pile.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.069
But I did.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.636
And my work was read.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.813
But it wasn't good enough.

30:17.293 --> 30:20.122
So...
I have to move on.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.558
No, you don't.

30:21.602 --> 30:22.951
I have to be
realistic.
Why?

30:22.995 --> 30:24.474
Because it's time.

30:24.518 --> 30:27.564
I gave myself one more book.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.871
It's time.MATEO: I really love

30:29.915 --> 30:31.917
your book, Mommy.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.310
Thanks, Mr. Sweetface.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.444
MATEO :
Our...

30:37.487 --> 30:41.143
story... be... gins...

30:41.187 --> 30:44.843
Mateo, that is the opening line
of my book!You just read that!

30:44.886 --> 30:46.496
I read it!You read!

30:48.194 --> 30:51.023
See? Something good
already came from it.

30:52.111 --> 30:53.329
Ew!

30:53.373 --> 30:54.765
No more kissing. More reading.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.158
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You got it.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.117
"'I want to run faster,'

30:58.160 --> 30:59.596
"he said to the cow.

30:59.640 --> 31:03.513
'But I'm a slow turtle,
and I don't know how.'"

31:17.571 --> 31:18.920
Yeah...

31:20.226 --> 31:22.228
And, friends, that's when...

31:22.271 --> 31:23.925
Oh, my God.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.275
My baby Baby's walking.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.711
You did it.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.365
Oh, my God,
I cannot believe this.

31:31.846 --> 31:34.066
You know what?
Let's not take this.

31:34.109 --> 31:38.592
Let's just enjoy our time
together and take selfies.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.768
Okay?

31:44.424 --> 31:46.034
The girls told me
what you had them do.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.907
I can't believe
they tattled on me.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.038
It's not funny, Jane.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.910
How could you not
tell me about this?

31:51.953 --> 31:53.563
Because I handled it.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.043
The girls are never
gonna trust me

31:55.087 --> 31:56.610
if I tell you
every single thing.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.438
Oh, well, too bad.
I'm their mother.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.570
Yes, you're their mother,
but I'm not their nanny.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.485
You can't just hand out
orders to me.

32:02.529 --> 32:05.271
I didn't plan to involve the
girls, it just kind of happened,

32:05.314 --> 32:07.969
and I'm sorry,
I really am.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.058
But I made sure the girls knew
that it was wrong.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.581
Uh...And I'm gonna work
really hard to make sure

32:11.625 --> 32:12.974
that they follow through
with their therapy,

32:13.018 --> 32:14.758
but I need to have my own
relationship with them.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.673
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: For the record, they would have

32:16.717 --> 32:19.154
their own relationship, one of
the most trying relationships

32:19.198 --> 32:20.677
of Jane's life.

32:20.721 --> 32:23.289
But I'm getting ahead
of myself.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.900
So no, I-I'm not going
to tell you everything,

32:25.944 --> 32:28.294
but like you said, the most
important thing is that

32:28.337 --> 32:32.037
they feel safe and loved,
which they do now, with me.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.215
Hello?PRICE :
This is Dr. Price.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.825
We amputated your mother's leg,

32:37.868 --> 32:40.306
but she's taken a turn
for the worse.

32:40.349 --> 32:43.526
Sorry to have to tell you this,
but she's now on life support.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.225
I told you before,
you can pull the plug.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.009
Actually, you need
to put that in writing.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.184
I did put it in writing.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.794
A text with a plug emoji

32:50.838 --> 32:52.709
and a thumbs-up doesn't count.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.450
You need to do it in person.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.757
Fine.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.846
I need to go to the hospital
to unplug my mother.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.282
Let's continue this in the car.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.685
Finally.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.614
Got it.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.529
My father's watch?

33:29.572 --> 33:33.185
The watch has nothing
to do with it.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.883
It's what's inside.

33:39.191 --> 33:40.322
A fingerprint?

33:40.366 --> 33:41.671
Your father's.

33:42.716 --> 33:45.023
Which means we can open it.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.937
Open...?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.682
Holy...

33:52.726 --> 33:55.424
Oh, yeah.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.558
It's go time, girl.

34:05.173 --> 34:08.568
They always look
so peaceful, don't they?

34:08.611 --> 34:10.439
Before they cross over?

34:10.483 --> 34:12.876
Mm? Oh, yeah. She looks great.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.444
So should we get this show
on the road?

34:15.488 --> 34:16.967
Excuse me?

34:17.011 --> 34:18.839
Unplug her?

34:20.058 --> 34:23.148
This is very... uh-- painful,

34:23.191 --> 34:26.368
uh, so, sooner the better.

34:26.412 --> 34:27.717
I understand.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.284
I'll get the paperwork,

34:29.328 --> 34:31.286
give you a chance to say goodbye
to your mother.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.548
Perfect.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.028
You can hold her hand.

34:40.382 --> 34:41.862
Awesome. Thank you.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.663
You okay?

35:00.707 --> 35:03.188
Is it done?

35:03.231 --> 35:05.581
No, not yet. I just needed
to get out of there.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.236
It's okay to feel sad.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.238
I do.

35:10.282 --> 35:14.808
Because...
I feel nothing for her.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.940
I was standing

35:16.984 --> 35:20.205
over her body
trying to remind myself

35:20.248 --> 35:24.992
of some of the good things
she's done, but I couldn't.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.125
She was a horrible,

35:27.168 --> 35:30.650
selfish, evil person, and
growing up with her was awful.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.260
I know.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.654
And you don't have to cry
for your mother.

35:34.697 --> 35:37.787
You can cry for yourself
because you deserved better.

35:37.831 --> 35:40.225
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.752
She's the reason I'm so
strict with the girls.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.928
If even some of her genes
passed down to them...

35:47.971 --> 35:50.322
Stop. The twins are great.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.672
They lie.Oh, all kids lie.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.195
They're just smarter than most.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.589
But they're gonna be all right
because they have you.

35:56.632 --> 35:59.287
And Rafael, and me.
And we're a team.

35:59.331 --> 36:00.941
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Don't say it.

36:00.984 --> 36:02.160
Team Twins.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.509
Lame Jane strikes again.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.685
They told you, huh?Yes.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.036
Hey. You okay?Yes, I am.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.604
You didn't have to come.Oh, stop.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.083
We are family.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.352
Hello?

36:20.395 --> 36:24.399
And, friends, I did say
her life would change forever.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.882
Oh, my God.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.884
Thank you.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.538
Who was that?

36:32.581 --> 36:34.714
An agent. A really big one.And?

36:34.757 --> 36:35.802
She wants to represent me.

36:35.845 --> 36:36.759
Jane!
What?!

36:36.803 --> 36:38.544
Jane!Yes!

36:38.587 --> 36:40.285
Yes!

36:40.328 --> 36:44.245
Oh, my God, Jane,
that's amazing.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.377
Um...

36:45.420 --> 36:48.249
Oh...RIVER: I'm really sorry.

36:48.293 --> 36:51.426
I couldn't get the tape.
I tried to, trust me.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.559
What happened,
did the map not work?No.

36:53.602 --> 36:56.388
I wasn't gonna go
into that swamp alone.

36:56.431 --> 36:58.259
I sent PJ.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.261
Who's PJ?Girl Rudy.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.090
But she couldn't
pull it off.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.397
And between you and me, I don't
even know how hard she tried.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.920
Well, you know what?
I-I actually think

37:06.963 --> 37:09.227
it's for the best.What are you talking about?

37:09.270 --> 37:11.229
Well, the first cut
was actually really good.

37:11.272 --> 37:14.928
And maybe right now,
for where I am in my life,

37:14.971 --> 37:17.147
not being the star
is a good thing.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.845
What, are you having a stroke?

37:18.888 --> 37:20.673
You're not making any sense.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.196
I know, it's crazy.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.546
All right, but I... But today,

37:24.590 --> 37:27.810
I-I got to see my daughter
walk for the first time.

37:27.854 --> 37:30.073
And I would have missed that,
just like I missed

37:30.117 --> 37:34.077
Jane's first steps,
and I don't want to.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.862
And I had
a health scare,

37:35.905 --> 37:39.387
and, well, all of that made me
realize that I am ready

37:39.431 --> 37:41.259
for the next phase in my life.

37:41.302 --> 37:44.087
I am okay being sidelined
just a little,

37:44.131 --> 37:46.307
becoming one of the standout
supporting characters

37:46.351 --> 37:48.091
that people look forward to,

37:48.135 --> 37:49.571
the one
who goes on to win

37:49.615 --> 37:52.095
Teen Choice Awards--

37:52.139 --> 37:54.446
the spice, not the dish--

37:54.489 --> 37:57.275
so I can enjoy
other parts of my life.

37:57.318 --> 38:00.669
Well, that's great.
That's just perfect.

38:00.713 --> 38:04.847
Oh, come on. Aren't you ready
to slow down, just a little?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.327
And focus on what?

38:06.371 --> 38:08.938
It's different for you.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.636
You've got these
great relationships

38:10.679 --> 38:12.159
with your daughters.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.160
Whereas mine

38:13.203 --> 38:15.423
barely even speaks to me.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.338
You have a daughter?

38:17.382 --> 38:20.472
Yes. In fact, you've met her.

38:20.515 --> 38:21.821
Excuse me?

38:21.864 --> 38:24.345
She's our P.A.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.872
Girl Rudy?

38:29.916 --> 38:31.831
Yeah. PJ.

38:31.874 --> 38:33.006
The P is for Pond.

38:33.049 --> 38:36.662
Pond Juniper Fields.

38:36.705 --> 38:37.880
Why didn't you tell me?

38:37.924 --> 38:39.447
She doesn't want people to know.

38:39.491 --> 38:42.058
That's why I'm mean to her.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.322
She wants to be treated
like everyone else.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.149
Wow, I can't believe it.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.500
Well, it's true. She hates me.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.371
That's why
I bury myself

38:50.415 --> 38:53.243
in my work, so I don't have
to face the fact

38:53.287 --> 38:56.203
that I failed as a mother.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.814
Well, you know what?

38:58.858 --> 39:00.512
I can help you win her back.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.688
No, it's too late.Don't say that.

39:02.731 --> 39:05.865
I reconnected with Jane
when she was 23 and a half.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.693
And the connection between
a mother and a daughter

39:07.736 --> 39:09.738
is so sacred.

39:09.782 --> 39:13.263
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well... sometimes.

39:21.097 --> 39:25.450
Mother, I wish your
life had been easier.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.103
And therefore, my life

39:27.147 --> 39:29.497
had been easier.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.630
Soon, you'll be
in a better place.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.371
Or not.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.504
Are you ready?Yeah, I'm ready.

39:36.548 --> 39:38.593
Did Magda just
squeeze her hand?

39:38.637 --> 39:40.943
Talk about a death grip.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.771
I'll just sign
with the other hand.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.120
Not quite ready
to let go.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.561
C-Can I have a proxy
sign for me?

39:49.604 --> 39:51.040
Jane, Raf? Either
one of you?

39:52.346 --> 39:53.608
There's activity.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.218
It's a miracle.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.570
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It's alive!

39:59.962 --> 40:01.921
We should order flowers.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.402
For Magda?
No. For Petra.

40:04.445 --> 40:07.448
I have a suggestion
for flowers.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.320
Now that everything is in place,
we can move forward.

40:10.364 --> 40:12.758
Is everyone ready?

40:17.284 --> 40:21.897
How about...
a half dozen roses?
