00:04.604 --> 00:06.138
        Oh, shoot!              

00:06.206 --> 00:07.973
         It's a minus!          
    I'm not pregnant.           

00:08.041 --> 00:09.575
        Well, we only started   
              trying last night.

00:09.642 --> 00:10.676
                         I guess
                 we can't expect

00:10.744 --> 00:12.144
                 to get pregnant
                 the first time.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.245
Well, I thought                 
that's what the fourth          

00:13.313 --> 00:16.181
and fifth times were for.       

00:16.282 --> 00:18.584
                     Fifth time.
            You imagine that?   

00:18.651 --> 00:21.086
I'm only up to three.           

00:22.789 --> 00:25.157
I just want to be               
pregnant now.                   

00:25.225 --> 00:26.925
Rebecca, why don't you          
approach this                   

00:26.993 --> 00:28.994
from a scientific point         
of view?                        

00:29.062 --> 00:31.363
Make a simple                   
plot-point graph,               

00:31.431 --> 00:32.898
and chart                       
your basal temperature          

00:32.966 --> 00:34.433
at a fixed hour                 
each morning.                   

00:34.501 --> 00:37.202
After a couple of months,       
a pattern will emerge,          

00:37.303 --> 00:41.807
thereby making your peak        
fertility days absolutely       
predictable.                    

00:41.875 --> 00:43.842
                      Good idea.
                 Thanks, Lilith!

00:43.910 --> 00:46.245
        Whew, boy!              
You guys went through all that? 

00:46.312 --> 00:49.815
No, we just got ripped one night
    and tore one off.           

00:52.118 --> 00:55.521

          Look, guys,           
     postcards from Woody.      

02:11.598 --> 02:12.531
Eh?                             

02:12.599 --> 02:13.565
                Eh?             

02:15.468 --> 02:16.368
        Hey, all right.         

02:16.503 --> 02:17.970
        Listen to mine.         

02:18.038 --> 02:20.506
  "Dear Miss Howe, I'm having   
a great time on vacation.       

02:20.573 --> 02:23.575
    "I miss everyone there,     
  but I miss you most of all.

         Love, Woody."          

02:24.678 --> 02:25.978
What does yours say, Sam?       

02:26.046 --> 02:28.313
 "Dear Sam, I'm having a great  
    time on vacation.           

02:28.381 --> 02:31.917
    "I miss everyone there,

02:41.327 --> 02:42.561
Well, "Dear Mr. Clavin,         

02:42.629 --> 02:44.329

02:51.838 --> 02:53.205
                Hey, Frasier,   
                         Lilith.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.373
            What'll you have?   

02:54.441 --> 02:55.874
A scotch, Sam.                  

02:55.942 --> 02:58.243
And whatever my Neanderthal     
husband will have.              

02:58.311 --> 02:59.845
    You two fighting?           

02:59.913 --> 03:01.413
No, on the contrary,            
Sam,                            

03:01.481 --> 03:04.183
I insist that                   
she call me that.               

03:04.284 --> 03:08.320
Frasier's been captivated       
by a new theory of masculinity  

03:08.388 --> 03:12.124
which suggests within each man  
is a hidden primal beast,       

03:12.192 --> 03:15.794
softened by years               
of civilization                 
and sensitivity.                

03:15.862 --> 03:18.130
He saw it on <i>Sally Jesse.</i>       

03:19.499 --> 03:22.901
Yes, and they got a really cool 
      name for this beast.      

03:22.969 --> 03:25.037
          It's called           
     the "Inner Hairy Man."     

03:26.439 --> 03:30.009
Or in your case, dear,          
"The Receding Hairy Man."       

03:30.076 --> 03:31.443
             She thinks it's all
                  very childish.

03:31.511 --> 03:32.845
No, I don't.                    

03:33.013 --> 03:34.313
Oh, tell your                   
little friends                  

03:34.381 --> 03:35.914
all about your                  
big field trip.                 

03:35.982 --> 03:38.050
    Primal journey, Lilith.     

03:38.118 --> 03:41.086
         You see, I'm just gonna
         get into my car and go.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.121
        Out on the open road.   

03:42.188 --> 03:43.956
          I'm taking a week off.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.358
          I'm gonna get in touch
        with my hidden beast.   

03:46.459 --> 03:48.193
         Ah, good luck.         

03:48.328 --> 03:49.595
          Thanks, Sam.          

03:49.662 --> 03:51.296
 You know, actually I was gonna 
     invite you to join me.     

03:51.364 --> 03:52.431
                  You see, I get
                a little nervous

03:52.499 --> 03:54.733
          when I drive at night.

03:54.801 --> 03:58.070
Oh, yeah, it'd be nice, but, uh,
 Woody's on vacation, you know. 

03:58.171 --> 04:00.406
                          CARLA:
                Oh, well, that's
                    okay, Sammy.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.074
        I could get my nephew   
            Frankie to help out.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.410
                He's a good kid,
            real sweet, Frankie.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.779
        Of course,              
he's never been in a bar,       

04:06.846 --> 04:08.514
    but he'll be okay.          

04:08.581 --> 04:09.782
  Oh, I don't know about this.  

04:09.849 --> 04:11.450
You know, this is my livelihood,
          my business.          

04:11.518 --> 04:12.918
          I don't want          
      to just turn it over      

04:12.986 --> 04:14.186
      to somebody because       
        they're family.         

04:14.254 --> 04:16.321
  He'll work for minimum wage.  

04:16.389 --> 04:18.390
            I'm in!             
Great!                          

04:18.458 --> 04:19.858
                          Great.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.860
      Hey, this is great.       
 So, uh, where are we gonna go? 

04:21.928 --> 04:23.429
    Desert? Mountains?          

04:23.496 --> 04:25.531
            Well, actually, Sam,
            the location doesn't
                  really matter.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.801
            This is more of a   
              spiritual journey,

04:28.868 --> 04:31.503
                an heroic quest.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.205
 You know, you know, if we, uh, 
      drive to California,      

04:33.273 --> 04:34.440
  we could go see Disneyland.   

04:34.541 --> 04:36.608
                  Ooh!          
                        Yeah.   

04:36.676 --> 04:40.045
Perhaps you could find your     
manhood on the giant teacups.   

04:42.382 --> 04:44.583
Yeah, a road trip               
to Disneyland.                  

04:44.651 --> 04:46.085
  Sounds fun.                   

04:46.152 --> 04:48.220
You want to join us, Norm?      

04:49.823 --> 04:50.956
Well (stammers)...              

04:51.024 --> 04:53.092
I'm sure you two gentlemen      
have something to do.           

04:53.193 --> 04:54.360
Oh, <i>no problemo.</i>                

04:54.427 --> 04:55.794
I got a couple of weeks vacation
coming up.                      

04:55.862 --> 05:00.699
                     Really?    
Oh, yeah, my supervisor         
reminds me daily.               

05:00.767 --> 05:02.234
      Well, Cliff, I, uh,       

05:02.302 --> 05:04.136
I don't know if my car is       
         big enough...          

05:04.237 --> 05:06.372
Oh, let's take my wagon.        
What do you say, Norm? Huh?     

05:06.439 --> 05:08.173
The four of us tooling          
down old mother road,           

05:08.241 --> 05:10.476
getting in touch with           
the old hairy man-mobile, huh?  

05:10.577 --> 05:12.344
         I don't know.          
  I don't think I could handle  

05:12.412 --> 05:14.413
         sitting still          
      for six hours a day.      

05:15.949 --> 05:18.984
Well, yeah,                     
it'd be more like ten.          

05:19.052 --> 05:20.185
        Oh, then I'm in.        

05:21.554 --> 05:22.988
SAM:                            
Boy, I'll never forget,         

05:23.089 --> 05:25.457
         when I was 19,         
     Buck, my best friend--     

05:25.525 --> 05:27.593
he was a teammate of mine       
        in the minors--         

05:27.660 --> 05:30.462
    he and I, uh, hitchhiked    
      all across Route 66.      

05:30.530 --> 05:31.797
                  Boy, best time
                     of my life.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.298
             Yeah?              
  Do they still have the place  

05:33.366 --> 05:35.000
    where the Cadillacs are     
 sticking up out of the ground? 

05:35.068 --> 05:36.702
Oh, yeah, Cadillac Ranch,       
in Merrimac Caverns.            

05:36.770 --> 05:37.970
            All right.          

05:38.038 --> 05:39.304
Yeah, once I lost               
a Hopalong Cassidy watch there  

05:39.372 --> 05:40.472
when I was ten.                 

05:40.540 --> 05:42.074
  Yeah, it just slipped         
right off my wrist.             

05:42.142 --> 05:43.876
Yeah, you wouldn't believe it,  

05:43.943 --> 05:46.745
but as a youth,                 
I had very fine-boned wrists.   

05:46.813 --> 05:50.215
I can't tell you how many       
people mistook me for royalty.  

05:50.283 --> 05:52.151
It's true.                      

05:53.586 --> 05:55.587
    Oh, what the hell!          
  We'll make it a group thing.  

05:55.655 --> 05:56.922
          All of us will get out
         and try to get in touch

05:56.990 --> 05:58.791
                 with our tribal
                      instincts.
      There you go.             

05:58.858 --> 06:01.260
     Oh, give me strength.      

06:01.327 --> 06:03.162
            Oh, come on, Lilith,
                be happy for us.

06:03.229 --> 06:04.830
We're all dropping              
our inhibitions.                

06:04.931 --> 06:07.333
     We're gonna go out and find
our manhood on the open road.   

06:07.400 --> 06:08.300
        Yeah, like men!         

06:08.401 --> 06:09.868
Yeah, like manly men!           
        Real men!               

06:09.969 --> 06:11.670
    Like those chicks           
     in <i>Thelma and Louise!</i>      

06:11.738 --> 06:13.972
        (cheering)              

06:14.040 --> 06:16.475
    Whoa, whoa, whoa!           
      What happened here?       

06:16.576 --> 06:18.243
Ah, the eight track's acting up 
      again there, Sammy.       

06:18.378 --> 06:19.778
        Grab the butter knife   

06:19.846 --> 06:21.280
 out of the glove compartment,  
        will you?               

06:22.615 --> 06:24.917
        Yeah.                   
                There you go.   

06:24.984 --> 06:26.151
          Here we are.          

06:26.219 --> 06:28.320
  Well, at least we still got   
        the A.M. radio.         

06:28.388 --> 06:30.823
                     So, how far
                have we gone?   

06:30.890 --> 06:32.958
Oh, about                       
a hundred miles.                

06:33.026 --> 06:33.959
                    Yeah.       

06:34.027 --> 06:35.994
                      Well, it's
                    minus 38.   

06:36.062 --> 06:37.296
         Why minus 38?          

06:37.364 --> 06:39.965
      Well, my trip meter       
     only sets back to 38.      

06:42.469 --> 06:46.338
        Well, let's see.        
What's a hundred minus 38?      

06:46.439 --> 06:48.674
Well, why don't we just,        
uh, drive 38 more miles?        

06:48.742 --> 06:49.875
Then we'll know                 
we've hit a hundred.            

06:51.044 --> 06:53.412
Hey...                          

06:53.480 --> 06:55.581
         I didn't know          
     you were good at math.     

06:55.648 --> 06:57.816
Yeah, well, you know,           
I used to be an accountant.     

06:59.519 --> 07:01.186
What you reading                
there, Fras?                    

07:01.254 --> 07:02.688
                    Oh, uh...   

07:02.756 --> 07:04.556
                    It's called 
                      <i>Iron John.</i>

07:04.624 --> 07:07.693
            It's a best-seller  
        about getting in touch  
    with one's masculinity.     

07:07.761 --> 07:09.328
              Mmm.              

07:09.396 --> 07:12.331
So you're actually gonna try    
to read in a moving car?        

07:12.399 --> 07:13.799
Doesn't that make you sick?     

07:13.867 --> 07:15.601
                             No.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.003
I always get sick               
when I read in a car.           

07:18.071 --> 07:20.472
The car bounces around,         

07:20.540 --> 07:23.809
you know, your eyes try         
to follow the words there.      

07:23.877 --> 07:25.411
         You can smell          
         the gas fumes.         

07:25.478 --> 07:28.247
Pretty soon, you start sweating 
    and gasping for breath.     

07:28.314 --> 07:29.748
What's the problem?             

07:29.816 --> 07:31.483
                    I'm sick.   

07:31.551 --> 07:34.887
    You know, I'll bet it's     
    from reading in the car.    

07:34.954 --> 07:37.189
        I'm telling you.        

07:49.436 --> 07:52.137
        (inhales)               
(moans)                         

07:54.441 --> 07:56.208
                        What?   

07:56.276 --> 07:58.344
I didn't say anything.          

07:58.411 --> 07:59.945
              Yeah, but you were
             thinking something.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.280
No, I wasn't.                   

08:01.381 --> 08:03.582
    Yes, you think I have the   
        hots for Carla's nephew.

08:03.683 --> 08:04.783
I didn't say that.              

08:04.851 --> 08:05.851
                    'Cause I do.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.920
No kidding?                     

08:07.987 --> 08:09.288
             Oh, like you don't?

08:09.356 --> 08:10.556
                You've only been
                sitting there   

08:10.623 --> 08:12.291
            for the last four   
            days staring at him.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.226
        And it's worse with you,
         because you're married.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.061
                  That's slutty.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.831
And what about you?             

08:18.898 --> 08:20.466
You're ogling him               
and meanwhile,                  

08:20.533 --> 08:23.335
you're trying to conceive       
a child with another man.       

08:23.403 --> 08:25.838
        Yes, but he is not my   
        husband, so that does   
             not make me a slut.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.143
    It's perfectly natural.     

08:31.211 --> 08:32.443
    One can be married          

08:32.511 --> 08:34.746
    and still be drawn          
  to the odd magnificent butt.  

08:34.847 --> 08:36.615
     For once I'm with you, Doc.

08:36.716 --> 08:40.452
     I agree, but you know      
 what I really notice in a guy? 

08:40.520 --> 08:42.388
        His eyes.               

08:42.455 --> 08:45.758
      Yeah, but that magnificent
butt thing is right up there.   

08:45.825 --> 08:47.726
              Yeah, well,       
        this guy has both.      

08:47.794 --> 08:49.328
And talk about biceps.          

08:49.396 --> 08:51.296
                    Whoa. You're
                 getting me hot.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.498
              Who are we talking
                     about here?

08:52.565 --> 08:54.733
Your nephew, Frankie.           

08:58.872 --> 09:02.107
                That is so sick!

09:02.208 --> 09:04.610
Carla, surely,                  
as a woman, you can see         

09:04.678 --> 09:08.380
how your nephew might be        
considered... desirable.        

09:08.448 --> 09:10.215
                 Sure. You start
             thinking like that,

09:10.283 --> 09:12.351
                  and you end up
            with Woody's family.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.991
        Just look at you two.   

09:19.059 --> 09:21.293
     You're acting like a couple
        of construction workers.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.763
                  Carla's right,
                         Lilith.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.498
          I mean, we're treating
                men just the way

09:26.566 --> 09:28.467
                we hate to be   
                treated by them.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.472
    Oops, I dropped my purse.   

09:33.540 --> 09:34.540
      I'll get it for you.      

09:37.744 --> 09:39.078
Here you go.                    

09:39.145 --> 09:40.212
        Thank you.              
You're welcome.                 

09:47.787 --> 09:50.589
                Thank you again.
 You're welcome.                

10:04.771 --> 10:06.071
        Okay, I got one.        

10:06.239 --> 10:07.906
When was the last time          
you guys cried?                 

10:07.974 --> 10:10.075
Huh? Cliffie?                   

10:10.176 --> 10:11.610
Uh... well, I guess the, uh,    

10:11.678 --> 10:14.680
it's probably my,               
uh, junior prom.                

10:14.748 --> 10:17.149
    Oh, no, no, no. Cliffie,    
 this is not that story where,  

10:17.217 --> 10:19.318
      uh, you got stood up      
  and you had to take your ma   

10:19.386 --> 10:21.186
  and everyone laughed at you   
    and pantsed you, is it?     

10:21.254 --> 10:25.524
  No, no, I said <i>junior</i> prom.   

10:29.095 --> 10:32.264
Yeah, you see, Ma was           
putting on a boutonniere,       

10:32.332 --> 10:35.234
and a pin stuck me in the chest,
I got a staph infection.        

10:35.301 --> 10:37.036
                          Hmm.  

10:37.103 --> 10:38.470
      How about you, Fras?      

10:38.538 --> 10:40.939
        Well, the day we left   
                  for this trip,

10:41.007 --> 10:43.709
            my son gave me a,   
                      a picture.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.144
And you cried?                  

10:45.278 --> 10:47.646
                 I cried because
            it was so beautiful.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.652
Good luck finding               
that hairy man.                 

10:56.756 --> 11:01.160
            Well, at least <i>I</i> can
            get pricked by a pin
             and not almost die.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.328
        What about you, Norm?   

11:03.396 --> 11:05.998
Well, there was                 
one time, uh,                   

11:06.066 --> 11:09.935
we thought Vera was             
pregnant, and...                

11:10.003 --> 11:12.504
 then it turns out she wasn't.  

11:12.572 --> 11:14.840
                I'm sorry, Norm.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.276
You never told me               
that, buddy.                    

11:17.377 --> 11:19.211
Well, it turns out,             
she was lying.                  

11:19.279 --> 11:22.348
She didn't tell me              
till after the wedding.         

11:25.018 --> 11:27.052
 I must have cried for a week.  

11:28.521 --> 11:29.855
      How about you, Sam?       

11:29.989 --> 11:32.358
Oh, you guys                    
should see him.                 

11:32.425 --> 11:34.593
(cooing):                       
He's sleeping                   
like a little baby.             

11:34.661 --> 11:35.928
Aw, it's so cute.               

11:36.029 --> 11:38.497
    (tires screeching)          
        (yelling)               

11:48.341 --> 11:51.043
What seems to be                
the trouble, Sam?               

11:51.111 --> 11:54.113
Well, I know a little bit       
     about engines, and...      

11:54.180 --> 11:56.081
    it seems like what          
         we got here is         

11:56.149 --> 11:58.050
    a burned piece of meat.     

12:00.120 --> 12:03.822
            Yeah, how is my, uh,
              hobo steak coming?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.658
    Oh, yeah, well, I           
    threw that on the engine    

12:06.726 --> 12:08.427
    back in, uh, Lukachukai.    

12:08.495 --> 12:11.663
At the risk of hearing          
your answer, Cliff,             

12:11.731 --> 12:14.133
why would you do                
something so stupid?            

12:14.200 --> 12:15.734
                Oh, well, you,  
              you cook in there.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.603
        You see, you put your   
            food on the engine, 

12:17.671 --> 12:19.872
          and then you can drive
      and cook at the same time.

12:19.939 --> 12:23.342
Oh, hey, it looks like the      
vegetable kabobs are about done.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.517
          Maybe they're a little
             bit too crisp, huh?

12:33.553 --> 12:34.920
                            SAM:
                  Come on, let's
             get back in the car

12:34.988 --> 12:36.689
    and go find a motel, huh?   
        Yeah, all right.        

12:36.756 --> 12:38.724
        Hey, Cliffie, I can't   
              turn the key here.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.560
Well, yeah, it's got a security 
    device on it there, Sam.    

12:41.628 --> 12:43.529
                             Oh.
Yeah, what I do                 
is turn the wheel               

12:43.596 --> 12:45.497
all the way to the left         
and then, uh,                   

12:45.565 --> 12:47.199
crank the key                   
as hard as I can.               

12:47.267 --> 12:48.434
         (keys jangle)          

12:48.535 --> 12:50.069
                            SAM:
                        Oh, man.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.504
Look at that. I just broke      
  the key off in the ignition.  

12:54.274 --> 12:57.376
                 I said "as hard
            as <i>I</i> can," Sammy.   

12:59.946 --> 13:01.447
    That's just great.          

13:01.514 --> 13:03.148
  What are we going to do now?  

13:03.249 --> 13:05.417
  Looks like I'm going to have  
to hot-wire the car here.       

13:05.485 --> 13:07.052
        Hey, wh-what am         
    I thinking about?           

13:07.120 --> 13:08.220
I've had my cellular phone      

13:08.288 --> 13:09.488
        the whole time;         
        we can just call        

13:09.589 --> 13:12.191
                    for help.   
No, come on,                    
come on, come on, come on.      

13:12.258 --> 13:13.826
Frasier, where's                
your hairy man?                 

13:13.893 --> 13:15.661
  We can save ourselves here.   

13:16.896 --> 13:18.964
    Yeah, hot-wiring's easy.    

13:19.032 --> 13:20.232
Buck showed me                  
how to do it                    

13:20.300 --> 13:22.434
on a trip                       
across the states.              

13:22.502 --> 13:24.670
    God, that guy was a whiz    
with anything mechanical.       

13:24.738 --> 13:25.704
    Yeah, here you go.          

13:25.772 --> 13:27.006
All you got to do is take       

13:27.073 --> 13:28.841
      these two wires here      
    and connect them.           

13:28.908 --> 13:30.809
    (electricity crackling)     

13:37.317 --> 13:38.884
You, you okay there, Sammy?     

13:38.952 --> 13:40.486
             Diane?             

13:46.559 --> 13:48.827
Yeah, well, uh, you know        
what your friend Buck, uh,      

13:48.895 --> 13:50.562
didn't, uh, reckon              
on there, Sammy,                

13:50.630 --> 13:53.699
     was that Cliff Clavin      
    anti-theft device.          

13:53.767 --> 13:55.534
         Yeah, you see          
    old Mr. Car Thief           

13:55.602 --> 13:56.669
gets the shock of his life,     

13:56.736 --> 14:00.039
    the doors automatically     
        lock shut,              

14:00.106 --> 14:01.373
    and the alarm goes off.     

14:01.441 --> 14:03.108
Wait a minute,                  
wait a minute.                  

14:03.176 --> 14:05.344
The doors <i>lock</i>                  
automatically?                  

14:05.412 --> 14:07.212
     Yeah, but the alarm's      
supposed to be going off.       

14:07.313 --> 14:08.414
            You know, it must   
                be on the fritz.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.315
            Our ears should     
              be ringing by now.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.317
  Oh, I'll just have            
  to do it manually.            

14:12.385 --> 14:15.354
 You locked us out of the car!  

14:17.590 --> 14:19.291
      (cell phone ringing)      

14:20.560 --> 14:21.827
                    My phone!   

14:21.895 --> 14:23.128
      My phone is ringing!      

14:23.196 --> 14:24.329
                      All right!

14:24.397 --> 14:26.665
And the doors are locked!       

14:26.733 --> 14:27.900
  Well, break the damn window!  

14:28.068 --> 14:29.101
            Are you kidding me?!

14:29.169 --> 14:30.369
            You know how much   
             those windows cost?

14:30.437 --> 14:31.904
    We don't have time          
     to argue here, Cliff.      

14:32.005 --> 14:33.405
             You're not breaking
                  those windows.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
      (ringing continues)       
     You just try it, young man.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.542
You're gonna have               
to come through me...           
        (glass breaking)        

14:36.609 --> 14:40.012
You're gonna pay for that,      
        I hope you know.        

14:40.080 --> 14:41.680
      (ringing continues)       

14:41.748 --> 14:43.749
         Hello? Hello?          

14:43.817 --> 14:45.384
                If it's Vera,   
                I'm not here.   

14:47.487 --> 14:49.855
     Yes, this is Frasier Crane.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.523
                Oh, thank God   
                somebody called.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.058
            The batteries are   
            getting sort of low.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.727
                Look, I don't   
                 have much time.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.195
Excuse me?                      

14:56.262 --> 14:58.030
             Y-Yes, I understand
          the Democratic party's

14:58.098 --> 14:59.331
             in trouble, and I'd
             love to contribute,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.400
             but I'm in a little
    trouble myself right now.   

15:02.736 --> 15:03.802
        Oh, damn!               

15:03.870 --> 15:04.970
    The batteries are dead!     

15:05.038 --> 15:06.739
SAM:                            
All right. Okay.                

15:06.840 --> 15:08.140
Let's, uh,                      
take it easy, Fras.             

15:08.208 --> 15:10.042
Nobody panic.                   
We'll be all right.             

15:10.110 --> 15:11.877
            FRASIER:            
             Great.             

15:11.945 --> 15:14.246
            We're lost, can't   
                  start the car.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.148
        Way to go, Sam.         

15:16.216 --> 15:17.383
SAM:                            
Oh, now wait a minute.          

15:17.450 --> 15:18.517
Don't blame me, you know.       

15:18.585 --> 15:19.885
 It's Cliff's fault for wanting 

15:19.953 --> 15:22.888
         to see America         
    like the pioneers.          

15:22.956 --> 15:24.990
We should've stayed             
on the main road.               

15:25.058 --> 15:27.459
              Did Charles Kuralt
          stay on the main road?

15:27.560 --> 15:28.794
Look, I'm not the one           

15:28.928 --> 15:30.429
 that fell asleep at the wheel. 

15:30.497 --> 15:31.730
I wouldn't have fallen          
asleep at the wheel             

15:31.798 --> 15:33.065
if you hadn't given me          
that extra shift.               

15:33.133 --> 15:35.567
 Well, we were behind schedule. 

15:35.635 --> 15:36.969
      Yes, I believe that       
         was your fault         

15:37.037 --> 15:39.438
for getting your fat butt lodged
        in that cavern.         

15:39.506 --> 15:42.875
      Well, I was looking       
 for my Hopalong Cassidy watch. 

15:42.942 --> 15:44.410
      Do you mind?!             

15:44.477 --> 15:45.978
SAM:                            
Ah, come on, you guys.          

15:46.079 --> 15:48.147
      Can we stop arguing       
  for, like, ten seconds here?  

15:48.214 --> 15:49.448
  Geez, Buck and I went across  

15:49.516 --> 15:51.650
    the entire United States    
and we didn't argue once.       

15:51.718 --> 15:53.519
    You know, frankly, Sam,     
I'm getting a little tired      

15:53.586 --> 15:56.088
  of hearing about Saint Buck!  

15:57.657 --> 15:58.757
         If he was so wonderful,

15:58.825 --> 16:00.159
             how come none of us
            has ever met him?   

16:00.260 --> 16:02.261
Because ever since he got       
     into the Hall of Fame,     

16:02.328 --> 16:04.530
he won't return my phone calls, 
    so I have to hang around    

16:04.597 --> 16:06.765
    a bunch of losers           
        in a stupid bar!        

16:06.833 --> 16:09.201
Does that answer your           
question, Mr. Hairy Man?!       

16:14.207 --> 16:15.474
      Oh, I'm sorry, guys.      

16:15.542 --> 16:17.142
I didn't mean                   
anything by that.               

16:17.210 --> 16:20.479
It's just that, well,           
he asked the question.          

16:24.551 --> 16:28.587
      You know, I, I hate       
  to bring this up, but, uh...  

16:28.655 --> 16:31.623
  we could really be in some,   
some serious trouble here.      

16:31.691 --> 16:32.858
Oh, come on, man.               

16:32.926 --> 16:34.693
Hey, listen,                    
at least we, uh,                

16:34.761 --> 16:36.328
      we've got each other      
          here, right?          

16:36.396 --> 16:37.429
            I mean, you know,   
                     here we are

16:37.497 --> 16:39.531
              out in the desert,
                 back to nature.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.000
              I mean, look, look
            at this air here.   

16:41.067 --> 16:42.301
         It's clear. It's fresh.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.969
              I mean, isn't that
            why we came out here

16:44.037 --> 16:45.471
             in the first place?
     Yeah, yeah.                

16:45.538 --> 16:47.306
    Look at the stars, guys.    

16:47.374 --> 16:48.507
         Look at that.          

16:48.575 --> 16:50.309
      Got to be a million       
        of 'em up there.        

16:50.377 --> 16:52.644
     Kind of makes you feel     
      insignificant, huh?       

16:54.047 --> 16:55.981
Yeah, I don't                   
feel anything.                  

17:03.323 --> 17:04.556
                    (sighs)     

17:05.759 --> 17:07.226
                        Frankie?
             Yeah?              

17:07.292 --> 17:08.794
              I need you to move
                 those big boxes

17:08.862 --> 17:09.994
            to the other side   
                of the poolroom.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.731
Gosh, Miss Howe,                
it's the fifth time today.      

17:14.034 --> 17:15.166
  I'm getting kind of sweaty.   

17:15.234 --> 17:17.169
      Well, then take off       
     your shirt, you goose.     

17:20.807 --> 17:22.273
I could have gone               
with those guys                 

17:22.342 --> 17:23.709
on that little road trip,       
you know.                       

17:23.777 --> 17:25.109
                      I know.   

17:25.178 --> 17:27.378
I just wasn't here              
when they decided to go.        

17:27.446 --> 17:28.747
                 So you've said.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.983
They, uh, probably              
tried to call me                

17:31.051 --> 17:32.885
and hung up on my machine.      
                    Hmm.        

17:32.952 --> 17:35.554
Sometimes it doesn't            
record the hang-ups.            

17:35.622 --> 17:37.556
                    Mm-hmm.     

17:39.325 --> 17:41.026
You're not much                 
of a conversationalist, are you?

17:44.798 --> 17:46.565
Where is everybody?             

17:46.633 --> 17:47.833
                     Probably in
              New Mexico by now.

17:47.901 --> 17:48.834
      You know, I could've      
         gone with 'em          

17:48.902 --> 17:50.936
 if they'd just left a message. 

17:51.037 --> 17:53.605
      No, I-I was talking       
        about my nephew         

17:53.673 --> 17:56.342
          and Rebecca           
      of Horny Brook Farm.      

18:00.113 --> 18:01.447
            They're in the back.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.315
            Frankie's helping   
            her move some boxes.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.917
      I'll just bet he is.      

18:04.984 --> 18:06.452
     You know, I'm getting      
    a little sick of the way    

18:06.519 --> 18:08.287
     she's throwing herself     
    all over that guy.          

18:08.355 --> 18:09.855
    I mean, it's disgusting.    

18:09.923 --> 18:11.957
            Carla, I've never   
          seen this side of you.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.092
Yeah, well...                   

18:13.193 --> 18:14.626
You know, Frankie's sweet.      

18:14.694 --> 18:17.096
One day he's going to meet      
  a nice girl and settle down.  

18:17.163 --> 18:18.864
      And in the meantime,      
          it's my job           

18:18.932 --> 18:20.699
          to keep him           
     away from sleazy women     

18:20.767 --> 18:22.401
looking for a quick one-nighter.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.269
        You mean women like you?

18:24.337 --> 18:27.039
          Ironic, huh?          

18:29.876 --> 18:31.810
          Oh, Frankie.          
                        What?   

18:31.878 --> 18:34.446
I thought I told you            
to stay away from Rebecca.      

18:34.514 --> 18:36.348
  Look, the woman is a tramp.   

18:36.416 --> 18:38.183
     All she wants you for      
         is your body.          

18:38.251 --> 18:40.419
 Miss Howe? She seems so nice.  

18:40.487 --> 18:41.620
                    (chuckling):
                Are you kidding?

18:41.721 --> 18:44.156
     She has had every man      
          in this bar.          

18:44.224 --> 18:45.391
    Every single one.           

18:45.458 --> 18:47.326
        What?                   
      That's right. Most of 'em,

18:47.460 --> 18:48.961
ten, 20 times.                  

18:49.029 --> 18:51.730
        Look, you're a good boy,
        Frankie. Now, go, go.   

18:51.798 --> 18:53.265
                Get out of here,
        before it's too late.   

18:53.333 --> 18:55.634
            Now, go.            
    Run like the wind!          

18:55.702 --> 18:57.136
                  Go! Don't ever
                      come back!

18:57.203 --> 18:58.604
I won't.                        

18:58.672 --> 19:01.140
 You know what I'm going to do  
        on the way home?        
                        What?   

19:01.207 --> 19:02.908
I'm going to stop               
at Saint Michael's,             

19:02.976 --> 19:05.344
and I'm going to pray           
for her soul.                   

19:07.847 --> 19:09.948
          You do that.          

19:10.016 --> 19:12.451
        How the hell did        
he ever get in my family?       

19:14.421 --> 19:16.221
PAUL:                           
Hey, Rebecca?                   

19:16.289 --> 19:18.457
                            Yes?
          Rumor has it          

19:18.525 --> 19:20.592
you've, uh, slept               
with every guy in the bar.      

19:20.660 --> 19:21.927
                    What?       

19:22.062 --> 19:23.829
So, uh, how come                
you haven't                     

19:23.897 --> 19:25.898
done the wild thing             
with old Paul, huh?             

19:30.370 --> 19:32.304
I never get included            
in anything.                    

19:35.408 --> 19:37.209
                          CLIFF:
    We're going to die out here.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.311
        They're going to find   
             our bleached bones.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.480
Look, let's just                
relax here, everybody.          

19:41.548 --> 19:43.716
Everything's going              
to seem better in the morning.  

19:43.783 --> 19:45.317
         Oh, yes, Sam.          

19:45.385 --> 19:46.652
    "In the morning."           

19:46.720 --> 19:48.854
                 When the desert
                sun comes up.   

19:48.955 --> 19:51.890
          By noon, it'll be 120!

19:52.025 --> 19:53.292
        Forget it, Doc.         

19:53.360 --> 19:55.828
 You're never going to see 120. 

19:55.895 --> 19:58.664
  At 110, your lungs explode.   

20:02.702 --> 20:03.836
      Cliff, that is ridiculous!

20:03.970 --> 20:05.471
                    Oh, yeah?   

20:05.572 --> 20:07.172
            Well, would you like
        to make a friendly wager

20:07.240 --> 20:09.575
            on that?            

20:09.642 --> 20:12.378
How many hours have             
we got till sunup?              

20:12.445 --> 20:15.280
      About four, I'd say.      

20:20.553 --> 20:23.422
              Well... I've lived
                    a good life.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.425
                The only thing I

20:26.493 --> 20:28.427
          regret is I didn't get
                 a chance to say

20:28.495 --> 20:30.029
              good-bye to Lilith
                  and Frederick,

20:30.096 --> 20:32.998
                to tell them how
            much I love them.   

20:33.066 --> 20:35.167
Well, at least you've got       
            somebody            

20:35.235 --> 20:36.802
to carry on your name, you know.

20:36.870 --> 20:38.404
    I-I don't have anybody.     

20:38.471 --> 20:40.939
    If I die out here,          
      it's me dying alone.      

20:42.175 --> 20:43.776
            No, you're not, Sam.
                  You've got us.

20:47.213 --> 20:51.717
Ah... here we are wasting       
away in the desert.             

20:51.785 --> 20:54.119
I never pictured                
that the four of us             

20:54.187 --> 20:55.320
would go out like this.         

20:55.388 --> 20:57.156
 How did you picture it, Cliff? 

20:59.959 --> 21:01.660
Well, I pictured, uh,           

21:01.728 --> 21:03.962
Sammy getting topped            
by a jealous husband.           

21:05.298 --> 21:07.299
Norm, I figured you'd,          
you know, heart attack.         

21:10.503 --> 21:12.604
Frasier here...                 

21:12.672 --> 21:14.239
            Cliff, I, I don't   
                want to hear it.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.709
You bet you don't.              

21:24.951 --> 21:26.018
            Oh, look at that.   

21:26.086 --> 21:27.653
                 The sun's about
                     to come up.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.588
                        FRASIER:
                        Say, uh,

21:29.656 --> 21:31.390
where's, where's Norm?          
                 Oh, he's asleep

21:31.458 --> 21:32.491
            in the back here.   

21:32.559 --> 21:33.926
         Yeah? Well...          

21:33.993 --> 21:35.427
 well, he's not asleep anymore. 

21:35.495 --> 21:37.062
Oh, hey, he's gone!             

21:39.332 --> 21:41.266
            Well, he's got to be
          around here someplace.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.601
    Norm!                       
                     Norm!      

21:42.669 --> 21:44.003
                Normie!         
    Norm!                       

21:44.170 --> 21:45.004
     Normie!                    
                        Norm!   

21:45.071 --> 21:47.006
Here, Norm!                     

21:47.073 --> 21:49.408
You, you don't suppose some wolf

21:49.476 --> 21:51.043
        dragged him off         
     in the night, do you?      

21:52.379 --> 21:54.546
      Well, maybe we ought      
    to take a look for him.     

21:54.614 --> 21:55.948
                        FRASIER:
                         Not me.

21:56.016 --> 21:59.084
 I don't want to meet the wolf  
    that can drag off Norm.     

22:01.321 --> 22:03.822
          (horn toots)          

22:03.890 --> 22:05.691
                        Norm!   
                        Norm!   

22:05.759 --> 22:06.959
          Thank God you're safe!

22:07.027 --> 22:09.361
             Yeah.              
                     Where'd you
                 get this thing?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.196
     It came complimentary      
         with the room.         

22:11.297 --> 22:12.364
                      What room?

22:12.499 --> 22:13.432
         At the resort.         

22:13.633 --> 22:14.867
                    What resort?

22:14.934 --> 22:17.403
 The resort just over the hill, 
    where I spent the night.    

22:17.470 --> 22:19.104
                    You mean you
              stayed in a resort

22:19.172 --> 22:20.839
             while we slept here
                in the dirt?!   

22:20.907 --> 22:22.107
             Why didn't you come
                    and tell us?

22:22.175 --> 22:24.276
                How could you do
        something like this?!   

22:24.344 --> 22:25.678
     You guys want to yell      
        at me some more,        

22:25.745 --> 22:27.379
     or do you want to make     
     the breakfast buffet?      

22:27.447 --> 22:28.681
    It stops in ten minutes.    

22:28.748 --> 22:30.249
                Well, naturally,
                     the buffet.
