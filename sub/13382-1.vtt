00:47.780 --> 00:49.258
<i>For blessed are the dead who die</i>

00:49.414 --> 00:51.358
<i>unto the Lord, for my enemies...</i>

00:55.347 --> 00:57.950
<i>The Devil has been invited
into New Bethlehem</i>

00:58.113 --> 00:59.647
<i>under our watch.</i>

01:13.680 --> 01:16.954
<i>The signs of the Drommelkind</i>

01:17.113 --> 01:19.318
<i>are clear to all with open eyes.</i>

01:31.447 --> 01:36.187
<i>Six girls born on the sixth day
of the sixth month.</i>

01:38.180 --> 01:41.056
<i>Their 18th birthdays approach.</i>

01:41.680 --> 01:44.352
<i>One will emerge.</i>

02:07.247 --> 02:08.350
Get another cloth!

02:08.513 --> 02:10.185
It's another girl.

02:22.314 --> 02:23.620
The prophecy.

02:25.780 --> 02:27.122
Push!

02:30.113 --> 02:32.091
Push! Push! Push!

02:32.247 --> 02:33.986
I need scissors! Thank you.

02:34.147 --> 02:35.522
<i>Bear down!</i>

02:37.780 --> 02:39.485
Push!

02:40.580 --> 02:42.455
<i>Almost here. Push.</i>

02:42.613 --> 02:44.250
It's a girl.

02:57.413 --> 02:58.686
Oh, please, Elders, don't.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.687
Midnight approaches.
The rapture is at stake.

03:01.846 --> 03:03.619
Number five.

03:03.780 --> 03:05.258
It's a girl.

03:06.446 --> 03:08.446
Step aside.

03:20.613 --> 03:22.591
Please let it be a boy.

03:27.113 --> 03:28.454
<i>Elder Beacon.</i>

03:32.314 --> 03:34.349
These births are an abomination.

03:34.513 --> 03:36.457
I will not let you do this.

03:43.113 --> 03:45.284
Six girls.

03:45.446 --> 03:47.583
These births are a miracle, Elder.

03:47.746 --> 03:50.315
He is here.
I can feel his presence.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.882
The prophecy is being fulfilled.

03:53.013 --> 03:54.252
Step aside, Jacob.

03:54.413 --> 03:55.948
You are not killing these babies.

03:56.113 --> 03:57.681
Are you insane?

04:11.147 --> 04:12.783
<i>Go to sleep</i>

04:13.446 --> 04:15.583
<i>Go to sleep</i>

04:15.746 --> 04:18.587
<i>Go to sleep</i>

04:18.713 --> 04:20.781
<i>Little Rose</i>

04:21.680 --> 04:24.590
<i>Go to sleep...</i>

04:25.746 --> 04:27.621
I'm so sorry, sweet Rose.

04:27.780 --> 04:30.917
But I can't let
this prophecy come to light.

04:31.780 --> 04:35.247
Forgive me. Forgive me.

04:35.413 --> 04:36.720
Forgive me.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.019
Forgive me.

04:39.180 --> 04:42.316
Forgive me. Forgive me.

04:42.479 --> 04:46.014
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

04:46.180 --> 04:50.419
Oh, my God.
Catherine, what have you done?

04:52.147 --> 04:53.749
This is the only remedy.

05:26.913 --> 05:28.948
Hey, what are we doing
about our birthday?

05:29.113 --> 05:30.112
Oh, I don't know.

05:30.113 --> 05:31.419
- This ought to be good.
- Something fun.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.524
What about a pony ride
and a banquet lunch

05:33.680 --> 05:35.282
<i>like when we were children?</i>

05:35.446 --> 05:37.617
- What?
- What's so funny about that?

05:37.780 --> 05:39.621
Pony rides and a banquet lunch?

05:39.780 --> 05:41.587
We're turning 18, Sarah, not 8.

05:41.746 --> 05:43.464
All right, we're just
throwing around ideas.

05:43.613 --> 05:45.454
Yeah, let's just have another
horribly boring birthday.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.284
Wait, wait, I got it.

05:48.446 --> 05:52.686
How about a moonlit dinner
with long tables and candles--

05:52.846 --> 05:56.289
And you seated between
Warren Adler and Lucas Finch.

06:08.646 --> 06:11.124
<i>Come in. The water feels great.</i>

06:13.147 --> 06:14.265
What the hell are you doing?

06:14.279 --> 06:15.450
Going for a swim.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.451
You're such an asshole.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.623
Get out!

06:25.846 --> 06:27.187
<i>Come on, we have to leave!</i>

06:29.780 --> 06:30.985
Abby.

06:32.513 --> 06:33.513
Abigail, come on!

06:33.680 --> 06:35.022
Abby. Abby.

06:35.813 --> 06:37.449
<i>Abby, come here.</i>

06:37.613 --> 06:40.250
<i>Abby, come here, put this on.</i>

07:01.913 --> 07:02.890
<i>Mary!</i>

07:03.813 --> 07:05.313
What happened?

07:08.446 --> 07:09.355
<i>Mary...</i>

07:12.146 --> 07:13.852
Come on, you can do it.

07:15.580 --> 07:19.422
<i>Oh, God. Come on. Come on, Mary.</i>

07:19.580 --> 07:20.922
<i>Come on.</i>

07:22.746 --> 07:25.122
She's going to be okay.
She's going to be okay.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.518
<i>She's going to be okay.</i>

07:28.846 --> 07:30.482
<i>Oh, come on, Mary.</i>

07:36.479 --> 07:38.115
Yeah, get it all out.

07:46.846 --> 07:47.983
You're gonna be okay.

07:48.146 --> 07:49.745
You just swallowed
a little bit of water.

07:52.112 --> 07:53.647
Thanks.

07:55.813 --> 07:57.484
<i>- Abby</i>
- Hmm?

07:57.646 --> 07:59.681
We need to go. Now.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.653
<i>We should've never come here.</i>

08:06.513 --> 08:08.582
We can't tell anyone about the boys.

08:08.746 --> 08:10.280
Elder Beacon will shun us.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.321
I said we shouldn't
go to the lake.

08:12.479 --> 08:14.753
Really, Sarah,
they were just boys.

08:14.913 --> 08:16.982
They were town boys and naked.

08:17.146 --> 08:19.681
- No one needs to know.
- But we can't lie.

08:19.846 --> 08:21.687
Don't they talk about us
enough as it is?

08:25.313 --> 08:26.484
You're sure
you're all right, Mary?

08:26.646 --> 08:28.282
Yes, I'm fine.

08:28.446 --> 08:30.185
Good night, then.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.351
Well, bye.

08:36.813 --> 08:38.756
Your fits always scare me.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.448
I gotta get home.

08:40.613 --> 08:42.682
I have chores to do.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.613
<i>Elder Stone on patrol.</i>

08:57.580 --> 08:59.285
Are you sure about supper?

08:59.446 --> 09:01.164
Well, then I suppose
we'll just have to talk

09:01.279 --> 09:02.518
about your first kiss tomorrow.

09:03.279 --> 09:04.621
What?

09:04.780 --> 09:07.621
What are you talking about?
What first kiss?

09:22.179 --> 09:23.657
Father?

09:40.446 --> 09:41.788
Father?

11:38.613 --> 11:41.489
No! No!

11:42.313 --> 11:45.189
No! No! No!

11:45.346 --> 11:48.256
No! No! No!

11:49.813 --> 11:51.688
No! No!

11:51.846 --> 11:53.289
No, please!

11:53.446 --> 11:55.287
No! No!

11:55.446 --> 11:58.287
No! No!

12:21.780 --> 12:23.280
Mary, where have you been?

12:23.446 --> 12:26.447
I'm sorry, I had another
one of my episodes.

12:26.613 --> 12:27.818
Have some water.

12:29.513 --> 12:31.422
Come sit down.
Are you all right?

12:31.646 --> 12:33.487
How bad was it this time?

12:34.279 --> 12:35.484
Medium.

12:35.646 --> 12:37.248
They're getting worse.

12:37.413 --> 12:38.516
They're not getting worse.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.055
She hasn't had one for years,

12:40.179 --> 12:42.952
and then she had one three days
ago and another one today?

12:43.112 --> 12:44.613
- Where were you?
- The lake.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.123
The near side or the far?

12:48.279 --> 12:50.154
I'm not quite sure
what the difference makes.

12:50.313 --> 12:52.791
Mary, watch your tone.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.114
I'm sorry, Rebekah.

12:57.279 --> 12:58.484
The far.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.185
Have you nothing to say to this

13:01.346 --> 13:03.085
that she insists
on defying rules?

13:03.246 --> 13:05.520
I hardly think a swim
is tantamount to treason.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.248
- Mary, Mary--
- Thomas, be quiet.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.448
- It was your idea to go off--
- Thomas, shut your mouth.

13:10.613 --> 13:12.091
- Mary!
- He's the one being impolite.

13:12.146 --> 13:13.453
Jacob, please.

13:13.613 --> 13:15.090
Don't talk to your brother
like that.

13:15.246 --> 13:17.690
You wipe that smile
off your face.

13:17.845 --> 13:19.414
I'm not hungry.

13:21.779 --> 13:24.018
You are not excused
from the table.

13:24.179 --> 13:27.089
Rebekah. I'll deal with this.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.421
I wish you would.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.683
She and those girls run around
with no repercussions.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.154
They're best friends.

13:44.146 --> 13:47.352
Try not to get so worked up
like that.

13:49.613 --> 13:51.920
Especially so soon after...

13:53.313 --> 13:55.348
You always take her side.

13:55.513 --> 13:57.013
You didn't let me finish.

13:57.179 --> 13:58.486
She hates me.

13:58.646 --> 14:00.248
Rebekah does not hate you.

14:00.379 --> 14:01.618
She doesn't.

14:01.779 --> 14:03.950
I'm trying to be
a good daughter.

14:04.112 --> 14:06.488
She treats me differently.

14:12.613 --> 14:14.613
I miss Mother.

14:20.313 --> 14:21.756
I know.

14:26.613 --> 14:29.181
She died, and I never
got to know her.

14:33.879 --> 14:36.914
There are some things over which
we just have no control.

14:41.146 --> 14:44.522
But I do know that she'd
be very proud of you.

14:46.513 --> 14:48.513
You are just like her,
you know that?

14:51.446 --> 14:52.923
Headstrong.

14:54.179 --> 14:55.623
But lovely.

14:59.845 --> 15:01.754
Try to get some sleep.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.451
Okay.

15:21.346 --> 15:22.483
<i>Martha?</i>

16:36.112 --> 16:39.352
Like so, providing a clean edge.

16:46.612 --> 16:49.420
Put the labels on straight,
Louisa.

16:49.579 --> 16:52.251
- A word, Rebekah.
- Yes, Elder Beacon.

16:52.413 --> 16:55.414
It seems Hannah Smith
has gone missing.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.580
<i>She did not return home last night.</i>

17:00.012 --> 17:03.286
Can someone tell me why it is
we live here in New Bethlehem,

17:03.446 --> 17:05.287
why we live as we do

17:05.445 --> 17:08.752
while all others
embrace the path of ease?

17:08.912 --> 17:10.446
To remain in the light.

17:11.712 --> 17:13.088
This is so, Mary Brown,

17:13.246 --> 17:16.281
for New Bethlehem
is a beacon of light

17:16.445 --> 17:18.616
in a dark world.

17:18.779 --> 17:22.121
And for this, we are glad
and give thanks.

17:23.112 --> 17:24.454
<i>Abigail Beecher,</i>

17:24.612 --> 17:28.852
what is it that Satan
craves most of all?

17:31.112 --> 17:32.385
You know it, child.

17:32.513 --> 17:34.751
I can read it in your face.

17:34.912 --> 17:40.084
The fiend craves young flesh.

17:40.246 --> 17:43.486
And he is more cunning
than you will ever foresee.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.123
He tempts our young women

17:46.279 --> 17:49.314
to the outside as he has
with Hannah Smith.

17:50.545 --> 17:53.853
I say this not to frighten you,
but to help you.

17:54.512 --> 17:55.615
Do you understand?

17:55.779 --> 17:57.086
Yes, Elder Beacon.

17:58.346 --> 17:59.346
That is good.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.485
Elder Beacon, if I may speak.

18:06.413 --> 18:07.482
<i>With all respect,</i>

18:07.645 --> 18:09.248
I do not believe Hannah
would have fled.

18:09.413 --> 18:11.118
<i>We were with her until dusk,</i>

18:11.279 --> 18:12.585
and she would've spoken
to one of us.

18:12.712 --> 18:15.247
Yes, you were with her.

18:15.413 --> 18:18.016
At the far side of the lake.

18:20.812 --> 18:24.120
<i>There are reasons
for our boundaries.</i>

18:29.645 --> 18:31.453
Work quietly.

18:36.679 --> 18:39.157
It doesn't make sense.
We watched her go home.

18:39.313 --> 18:40.654
Maybe she went
to go see the boys.

18:40.812 --> 18:42.154
No.

18:42.313 --> 18:44.620
She could have.
She's done it before.

18:44.779 --> 18:46.950
- We have to look for her.
- But we can't.

18:47.112 --> 18:49.249
Sarah, this isn't
the time for rules.

18:49.413 --> 18:51.322
We have to do it ourselves.

18:51.478 --> 18:52.956
Tonight.

19:34.112 --> 19:37.113
Father, may I please go to
Ruth's house after I've cleared?

19:37.279 --> 19:38.620
At this hour?

19:38.779 --> 19:40.620
We're all really worried
about Hannah.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.314
We'd just like to be together.

19:43.779 --> 19:44.756
Please?

19:48.179 --> 19:49.520
All right. Not too late.

19:49.679 --> 19:50.918
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:53.046 --> 19:54.183
Plate.

20:00.512 --> 20:01.956
Not that way.

20:02.112 --> 20:03.987
How else do you expect
to go to town?

20:04.146 --> 20:05.680
We're not going to town.

20:05.845 --> 20:07.323
Where are we going?

20:07.478 --> 20:09.422
You just have to trust me.
Come on.

20:09.579 --> 20:12.523
Your daughters' 18th birthdays

20:12.679 --> 20:14.782
will arrive in just days.

20:15.645 --> 20:18.521
We all know the dangers
that could befall us.

20:18.679 --> 20:23.249
The signs of the Drommelkind
are clear to all with open eyes.

20:23.745 --> 20:28.689
Six girls born on the sixth day
of the sixth month.

20:28.845 --> 20:32.687
Yet you, Jacob Brown,
declared it a miracle.

20:32.845 --> 20:35.016
Even now,
with this disappearance,

20:35.179 --> 20:37.123
you think it a coincidence?

20:37.279 --> 20:38.347
These are normal girls,

20:38.512 --> 20:40.115
and they've lived
their whole lives

20:40.279 --> 20:42.483
with the whispers of something
they know naught of.

20:42.645 --> 20:48.318
As we speak, they are together
at Ruth's house worried sick.

20:48.478 --> 20:51.286
Ruth spoke of the girls
convening at Abigail's.

20:51.445 --> 20:52.582
<i>You see?</i>

20:52.745 --> 20:54.620
They break covenant
at every turn.

20:54.779 --> 20:57.155
You are losing
your tether on them.

20:57.313 --> 21:00.018
<i>Your own flesh deceives you,
and yet you doubt</i>

21:00.179 --> 21:01.986
the Prince of Lies
could do the same.

21:02.146 --> 21:05.181
Dear Elders, is there
a remedy we may speak of?

21:05.345 --> 21:08.153
You are all aware of the remedy.

21:08.312 --> 21:09.483
<i>The remedy?</i>

21:09.645 --> 21:11.645
These rumors are running
out of control.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.120
Satan has been invited into
New Bethlehem under our watch!

21:16.545 --> 21:18.420
<i>Their 18th birthdays approach.</i>

21:18.579 --> 21:20.417
Abby, would you just tell us
where we're going?

21:20.445 --> 21:22.753
<i>One will emerge.</i>

21:24.779 --> 21:26.313
<i>We're here.</i>

21:28.812 --> 21:31.017
<i>I'm really not sure about this.</i>

21:31.179 --> 21:33.123
- Abby, what are you doing?
- Blending in.

21:33.279 --> 21:34.950
We can't go in there.
It's forbidden.

21:35.112 --> 21:37.282
<i>What if Hannah's here
and we turn back now?</i>

21:44.112 --> 21:45.282
Mary!

21:50.246 --> 21:51.223
Come on.

21:54.315 --> 21:56.982
<i>Dope record, go call Guinness</i>

21:57.015 --> 21:59.148
<i>This moment, let's own it,
yeah, we all in it</i>

21:59.181 --> 22:01.181
<i>Let's get busy, yeah, who's with me?</i>

22:01.215 --> 22:03.583
<i>All these lights and they,
oh, so pretty</i>

22:03.616 --> 22:05.815
<i>Just one night to live like kids</i>

22:05.848 --> 22:08.083
<i>See, I'm on fire, and this my city</i>

22:08.115 --> 22:10.550
<i>Let's get busy, come on, who's with me?</i>

22:10.583 --> 22:12.849
<i>All these lights,
and they, oh, so pretty</i>

22:12.882 --> 22:14.983
<i>Just one night to live like kids</i>

22:15.016 --> 22:16.683
<i>See, I'm on fire, and this my city</i>

22:16.716 --> 22:18.750
<i>You see, the night is on my mind</i>

22:18.783 --> 22:20.250
<i>Making music is on the table,
I'm able to do the limbo</i>

22:20.283 --> 22:22.150
<i>Get low and get on the Maybelline</i>

22:22.183 --> 22:24.083
<i>Makeup girlies are dancing,
not on the pick up...</i>

22:25.179 --> 22:26.485
Hello, commune girl.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.283
What are you doing here?

22:28.445 --> 22:29.650
Looking for our friend.

22:29.812 --> 22:31.949
She has reddish hair.
You met her at the lake.

22:32.112 --> 22:34.248
I might know where
we could go find her.

22:34.412 --> 22:35.685
Wanna go take a look?

22:36.812 --> 22:37.755
Yeah.

22:37.912 --> 22:39.185
Let's go.

22:39.345 --> 22:40.687
We'll check this way.

22:41.679 --> 22:42.656
Abby.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.313
We should go home.
We need to go home.

22:44.478 --> 22:47.684
Is that her?
Is that her? Hannah.

22:47.845 --> 22:49.187
Long time no see.

22:49.345 --> 22:50.984
I save your life,
and I don't get a hello?

22:53.112 --> 22:55.680
Trevor.
I'm surprised to see you here.

22:55.812 --> 22:58.653
- We're not supposed to be here.
- Hey, where's your bonnet?

23:01.012 --> 23:02.353
That doesn't bother you?

23:02.512 --> 23:03.956
Should it?

23:04.112 --> 23:06.612
You want to take a walk?
Come on.

23:10.579 --> 23:12.114
- Hannah?
- Hannah?

23:16.046 --> 23:17.023
Hey.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.588
- You want a beer?
- No.

23:22.112 --> 23:23.612
Yeah, I'm not thirsty either.

23:26.245 --> 23:27.587
Look at that.

23:27.745 --> 23:30.348
It's a new moon tonight.
They're all out.

23:30.512 --> 23:33.217
The little dipper, Ursa Major.

23:35.612 --> 23:37.090
What?

23:37.245 --> 23:39.348
That-- that's not Ursa Major.

23:39.512 --> 23:41.149
That's Cassiopeia.

23:41.312 --> 23:43.256
That's Ursa Major.

23:47.178 --> 23:49.281
I should've known you'd know
more about that stuff than me.

23:49.445 --> 23:51.616
Well, I'm not supposed to,
but my father taught me.

23:51.779 --> 23:54.188
Well, way to impress
a girl, right?

23:56.545 --> 23:57.614
I didn't mean--

23:57.779 --> 23:59.620
I'm not trying to impress you.

23:59.779 --> 24:01.052
Shit.

24:01.745 --> 24:03.950
Sorry, my language.

24:04.112 --> 24:05.612
Stupid me.

24:07.478 --> 24:09.615
You make me nervous.

24:09.779 --> 24:11.518
I make you nervous?

24:13.278 --> 24:14.517
Yeah.

24:24.278 --> 24:26.278
I-I have to--
I have to go.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.623
Abby? Ruth!

24:47.312 --> 24:48.312
Hannah?

25:36.779 --> 25:40.188
<i>Another of our flock
has disappeared.</i>

25:40.345 --> 25:43.414
Abigail Beecher did not return

25:43.579 --> 25:46.318
<i>to her family yesterday eve.</i>

25:47.111 --> 25:50.646
And like the disappearance
of Hannah Smith,

25:51.512 --> 25:53.251
I believe

25:53.378 --> 25:56.515
this is the work of an evil

25:56.679 --> 25:59.122
we have known for many years.

25:59.278 --> 26:02.313
<i>Those of you who know
of what I speak</i>

26:02.478 --> 26:05.854
know the mortal danger
New Bethlehem is now in.

26:09.111 --> 26:13.453
I fear that only sin
and transgression

26:13.612 --> 26:15.851
can breach our walls,

26:15.979 --> 26:19.320
for are we not good soldiers?

26:19.478 --> 26:22.285
Will we not be as bold as lions?

26:22.445 --> 26:24.218
- Yes.
- Yes.

26:25.278 --> 26:26.620
Hey, Mary.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.955
Can I talk to you for a minute?

26:29.111 --> 26:30.316
What are you doing here?

26:30.912 --> 26:33.185
Hold on a second.
I need to talk to you.

26:33.345 --> 26:34.448
I can't, not here.

26:34.612 --> 26:36.112
Frank's missing.

26:37.612 --> 26:40.987
Ever since the party.
Do you know anything about that?

26:41.912 --> 26:44.116
No, I-- just...

26:44.278 --> 26:47.017
Look, sorry if I came on
too strong,

26:47.178 --> 26:48.850
but it's important.

26:49.345 --> 26:51.619
Can I help you, young man?

26:53.812 --> 26:55.619
Hi, I'm Trevor.

26:57.211 --> 26:58.484
Do you two know each other?

26:59.679 --> 27:01.623
Oh, no, I was just asking
if anyone here knew anything

27:01.779 --> 27:04.313
about the accident last night
out on the interstate.

27:06.378 --> 27:09.136
My dad's the sheriff, and so sometimes
I help him collect information.

27:09.245 --> 27:11.519
I don't think they would,
but if you must inquire,

27:12.712 --> 27:14.985
Elder Beacon handles
such matters.

27:17.779 --> 27:19.688
Okay, well, thanks,
sorry for the interruption.

27:30.312 --> 27:32.415
Mary, you should eat.

27:32.579 --> 27:34.579
Father, what does
Elder Beacon speak of?

27:34.745 --> 27:38.314
This evil we have feared
for decades, what is that?

27:38.478 --> 27:40.285
He speaks of the Drommelkind.

27:40.445 --> 27:41.945
Rebekah.

27:42.111 --> 27:43.952
- Please?
<i>- What is the Drommelkind?</i>

27:44.111 --> 27:45.430
Is that what people
whisper of us?

27:45.478 --> 27:47.285
Oh, it's just an old tale,
a myth.

27:47.445 --> 27:48.945
Please tell me.

27:49.111 --> 27:51.952
For once, Mary and I
are in agreement.

27:52.111 --> 27:54.020
<i>Answer the girl's question.</i>

27:55.312 --> 27:57.390
Thomas, will you take your
siblings upstairs, please?

27:57.512 --> 27:59.319
- But I want to hear.
- Now.

28:05.579 --> 28:07.579
When the six of you were born,

28:07.712 --> 28:09.950
Elder Beacon declared

28:10.111 --> 28:12.089
that the prophecy
was being fulfilled

28:12.245 --> 28:14.655
and a great evil
would enter our world.

28:14.812 --> 28:16.448
But there are only five of us.

28:16.612 --> 28:20.317
Little Rose died
when she was a baby,

28:20.478 --> 28:22.955
<i>but the remaining five of you,</i>

28:23.111 --> 28:24.612
<i>you all grew up together
like sisters.</i>

28:25.712 --> 28:26.950
And our 18th birthday,

28:27.111 --> 28:28.646
what significance
does that have?

28:28.812 --> 28:31.483
The prophecy is
that on that day,

28:31.645 --> 28:34.623
only one would remain.

28:34.779 --> 28:36.620
She would become
the Devil's hand,

28:36.779 --> 28:38.347
the Drommelkind.

28:40.412 --> 28:42.151
That cannot be true.

28:42.312 --> 28:43.790
<i>Most certainly not.</i>

28:44.779 --> 28:47.188
But there is something
you should know.

28:47.345 --> 28:49.118
On the day you were born,

28:49.278 --> 28:51.688
Elder Beacon
wanted you all killed.

28:51.844 --> 28:53.413
Not many people know this.

28:53.579 --> 28:56.420
I would not let him.

28:56.579 --> 28:58.352
And he's hated me ever since.

28:58.512 --> 29:00.114
<i>He does not hate.</i>

29:00.278 --> 29:04.017
He only loves and is loved.

29:04.178 --> 29:06.315
That's because
he leads with fear.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.145
How can you be so sure
it's just a myth?

29:09.312 --> 29:11.187
It's been handed down
from mouth to mouth

29:11.345 --> 29:13.380
through generation
to generation.

29:14.145 --> 29:17.521
<i>It's born of the occult.
It was invented by man.</i>

29:17.679 --> 29:19.247
Man is fallible.

29:19.412 --> 29:20.946
The Devil exists.

29:21.078 --> 29:22.613
Does he not?

30:10.811 --> 30:12.221
Hey there.

30:23.612 --> 30:25.089
You okay?

30:26.078 --> 30:27.454
It's okay.

30:29.679 --> 30:31.486
I'm gonna let you go.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.589
Rebekah?

31:20.744 --> 31:24.688
I finished my chores.
May I go pick up some yarn?

31:24.844 --> 31:26.822
You're dressed so nicely.

31:28.412 --> 31:29.980
Thank you.

31:30.145 --> 31:31.918
All to run errands for yarn?

31:35.811 --> 31:36.754
Very well.

31:52.645 --> 31:53.951
Hi, Sarah.

31:57.911 --> 31:58.911
Hi, Mr. Maker.

32:14.911 --> 32:16.253
<i>Hey.</i>

32:18.278 --> 32:19.119
Hi.

32:19.345 --> 32:20.186
Hi.

32:20.345 --> 32:21.686
You look pretty.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.248
What is it?

32:28.345 --> 32:30.619
Just everything.

32:31.478 --> 32:32.478
Hey...

32:33.312 --> 32:34.517
hey, it's okay.

32:39.278 --> 32:42.449
My father always sides with her.

32:42.611 --> 32:44.850
Rebekah thinks I'm the Devil.

32:48.111 --> 32:50.350
No, really,
she thinks I'm the Devil.

32:51.111 --> 32:55.180
You know that whole story
is totally ridiculous, right?

32:57.345 --> 32:58.617
I mean, the Devil?

33:00.611 --> 33:01.987
It's just crazy talk.

33:05.278 --> 33:07.347
And I hate to say it, but,

33:09.111 --> 33:11.419
I don't know what kind of mother
would talk about her daughter like that.

33:11.545 --> 33:12.851
She's not my mother.

33:14.911 --> 33:17.446
She died when I was five.

33:21.211 --> 33:22.586
I knew we had
something in common.

33:26.211 --> 33:27.348
I was seven.

33:38.111 --> 33:39.645
You have the hands of a worker.

33:39.811 --> 33:41.982
Some dirt under the nails,
that's good.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.521
Thanks, but it's grease,
actually,

33:43.678 --> 33:45.917
from the gas station
where I work on Oak.

33:47.911 --> 33:49.582
That's still work.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.346
Sarah!

34:45.411 --> 34:47.685
I found Abby and Hannah.

34:48.344 --> 34:49.788
They've been murdered.

34:51.744 --> 34:54.120
Father, she found
Abby and Hannah!

34:54.678 --> 34:55.882
<i>They' re dead!</i>

35:01.644 --> 35:02.986
Forgive me, Sarah.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.448
<i>- The Lord in whom we trust.</i>
- Bless your soul, child.

35:16.611 --> 35:19.680
Praise be to the Lord
in whom we trust.

35:19.844 --> 35:23.414
Praise be to the Lord
in whom we trust.

35:25.811 --> 35:31.381
I know it is hard to see
and even harder to accept.

35:32.778 --> 35:35.779
<i>Our children have been violated.</i>

35:36.778 --> 35:41.314
I stand before you
in great pain and anguish.

35:41.477 --> 35:44.648
We must also mourn

35:44.778 --> 35:46.983
the loss of Tobias Maker.

35:48.544 --> 35:52.045
He gave his life
to protect his daughter.

35:52.278 --> 35:53.778
At your command.

35:56.477 --> 35:59.853
I commanded him nothing,
Jacob Brown.

36:01.778 --> 36:06.280
At least take your own
responsibility in this matter.

36:06.444 --> 36:09.252
He knew that his sacrifice

36:09.411 --> 36:11.480
could give deliverance
to his daughter.

36:14.145 --> 36:17.452
Sarah Maker, Ruth Warren,
Mary Brown,

36:17.611 --> 36:19.520
stand before the community!

36:27.278 --> 36:28.687
You tell him, Mary.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.054
Tell me, children.

36:45.178 --> 36:47.519
Were you with Abigail Beecher

36:48.611 --> 36:50.919
on the last night
she was seen in this world?

36:52.211 --> 36:53.449
<i>Where did you go?</i>

36:57.811 --> 37:00.414
- Speak!
- We were taken to a party.

37:00.578 --> 37:05.023
There was drunkenness
and lewdness and blasphemy.

37:05.811 --> 37:08.448
These girls have broken the covenant.

37:08.611 --> 37:11.680
<i>They caroused with temptation!</i>

37:12.312 --> 37:15.585
<i>From now on,
they must be within sight</i>

37:15.744 --> 37:18.620
<i>of another member of the flock
at all times.</i>

37:18.778 --> 37:23.280
And there will be no further
contact with the outside.

37:23.444 --> 37:25.820
No exceptions!

37:37.744 --> 37:39.312
<i>And those who work evil.</i>

37:39.477 --> 37:42.081
<i>For blessed are the dead
who die unto the Lord,</i>

37:42.245 --> 37:44.018
<i>for they will see
the kingdom of Heaven.</i>

37:44.178 --> 37:47.281
<i>Let the Lord descend upon me
and deliver me from my enemies.</i>

37:47.978 --> 37:49.115
Lord, strengthen me
and protect me

37:49.278 --> 37:51.085
from those
who rise up against me.

37:51.245 --> 37:52.586
Lord, cast out my enemy

37:52.744 --> 37:55.517
<i>and deliver me
from those who work evil.</i>

38:03.644 --> 38:04.621
It's in you!

38:04.778 --> 38:05.687
Mother!

38:08.578 --> 38:10.419
It's in you.

38:33.344 --> 38:34.254
Ruth.

38:34.377 --> 38:35.286
Oh, God, Mary.

38:35.444 --> 38:37.353
What happened? Are you okay?

38:38.344 --> 38:41.652
My mother last night,
she was trying to kill me.

38:41.811 --> 38:44.085
Spare my daughter!

38:44.245 --> 38:45.449
This is the only remedy!

38:45.611 --> 38:46.588
Mother?

38:47.578 --> 38:49.487
Mother, no! Mother!

38:50.111 --> 38:51.850
No! Mother!

39:09.811 --> 39:11.153
<i>Mary Brown?</i>

39:11.444 --> 39:13.285
It's time for your examination.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.619
<i>Daughter of Christ,</i>

39:28.778 --> 39:31.654
have you cast your eyes
upon the abyss,

39:32.111 --> 39:33.588
the land of bedlam,

39:33.744 --> 39:36.244
where Lucifer sits
upon his dark throne?

39:36.411 --> 39:37.616
No, never.

39:37.778 --> 39:39.120
Have you felt yearnings

39:39.277 --> 39:42.619
that were beyond
the measure of your control?

39:44.244 --> 39:45.449
Elder...

39:45.611 --> 39:48.021
You know of what I speak.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.519
Have you felt these stirrings?

39:51.811 --> 39:53.811
Answer me, child,

39:54.277 --> 39:57.085
or you will find yourself
shunned like your mother.

39:58.978 --> 39:59.978
Shunned?

40:05.578 --> 40:07.522
<i>Rise, child.</i>

40:15.611 --> 40:17.282
Lower your dress.

40:19.411 --> 40:21.252
<i>Put modesty aside.</i>

40:21.411 --> 40:24.287
You must be examined for signs
of the Drommelkind.

40:39.744 --> 40:41.244
All of it.

40:57.711 --> 40:59.279
Take this glass of water.

40:59.444 --> 41:01.115
Hold it.

41:01.277 --> 41:03.778
And do not spill
even the merest drop.

41:10.110 --> 41:14.851
Our bodies are the receptacles
of our eternal souls.

41:17.611 --> 41:21.521
So it is there that
the Devil will hide.

41:25.744 --> 41:28.119
Do not be alarmed if you feel...

41:29.277 --> 41:30.687
discomfort.

42:17.177 --> 42:18.246
Slow down, Mary.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.980
I have to find my father.

42:20.144 --> 42:21.451
Elder Beacon said
my mother was shunned.

42:21.611 --> 42:23.611
- He should be shunned!
- Ruth.

42:24.444 --> 42:26.353
He found no signs
of the Devil on any of us.

42:26.511 --> 42:28.648
Sarah, he wasn't looking
for the Devil.

42:28.811 --> 42:30.482
Yes, he was.
He was testing our humility.

42:30.644 --> 42:32.280
Oh, is that what he was doing?

42:32.444 --> 42:34.115
Our birthday approaches, Ruth.

42:34.277 --> 42:36.619
We must let him help us,
no matter how queer it seems.

42:36.778 --> 42:38.449
Queer?

42:38.611 --> 42:40.418
You call what he did
in there queer?

42:40.578 --> 42:42.136
If we hadn't dropped
the glass of water,

42:42.144 --> 42:43.486
he would know our modesty
had been breached

42:43.644 --> 42:45.178
and we had laid down
with Lucifer.

42:45.344 --> 42:47.185
He's a lech
using this as an excuse

42:47.344 --> 42:48.686
to touch our bodies.

42:48.844 --> 42:51.082
This is not the first exam
for either of us.

42:51.244 --> 42:52.187
No, Ruth, no.

42:52.344 --> 42:54.413
- Open your eyes!
- Ruth.

42:54.578 --> 42:58.112
He has this entire community
quivering with fear

42:58.277 --> 43:00.949
so he can do exactly
as he pleases.

43:01.110 --> 43:03.088
- Stop it.
- Sarah...

43:03.244 --> 43:05.518
Abby and Hannah are dead.

43:07.778 --> 43:11.278
You know what Abby told me
the day before she died?

43:11.444 --> 43:14.479
He threatened her life when
she refused his perversions.

43:14.644 --> 43:16.679
He killed Abby
to keep her silent,

43:16.844 --> 43:18.402
and I believe he did
the same to Hannah!

43:18.477 --> 43:19.614
No. No!

43:19.778 --> 43:20.755
Sarah!

43:20.911 --> 43:23.149
Let her go. She's hopeless.

43:23.311 --> 43:25.118
We have to stop him, Mary.

43:25.277 --> 43:28.687
And you need to be quiet.
Be sensible, Ruth.

43:28.844 --> 43:30.947
You'll get us into
even more trouble.

43:38.744 --> 43:40.483
I want to know the truth.

43:45.144 --> 43:46.451
What about?

43:46.611 --> 43:48.145
My mother.

43:49.477 --> 43:51.113
Elder Beacon
said she was shunned.

43:52.711 --> 43:53.814
Do not lie to me!

44:04.844 --> 44:06.344
It's true.

44:06.511 --> 44:07.682
Why?

44:07.844 --> 44:09.185
That's not important now.

44:09.344 --> 44:11.083
It is to me. Tell me.

44:11.244 --> 44:13.188
<i>She summoned the Devil.</i>

44:13.344 --> 44:14.481
Rebekah.

44:14.644 --> 44:16.144
She invited the Devil
into the commune

44:16.311 --> 44:18.255
hoping to sway the prophecy.

44:18.411 --> 44:19.684
That is why she was shunned.

44:19.844 --> 44:22.447
This is between me
and my daughter.

44:22.611 --> 44:24.384
<i>Would you leave us, please?</i>

44:25.611 --> 44:26.986
Now.

44:34.244 --> 44:36.586
She never died, did she?

44:38.377 --> 44:41.150
You have to understand
that in our community,

44:41.311 --> 44:43.118
shunning is akin to death.

44:43.277 --> 44:44.482
Where is she?

44:47.644 --> 44:49.519
She stayed right in Greenville.

44:50.544 --> 44:53.283
You let me believe all these
years that she was dead!

44:53.444 --> 44:55.854
- Mary, please--
- Stay away from me!

45:11.811 --> 45:14.152
Come now. Go in. Go.

45:14.311 --> 45:15.947
<i>What could they want?</i>

45:16.110 --> 45:18.349
<i>Why are they here?</i>

45:22.311 --> 45:23.152
Mary!

45:23.744 --> 45:25.187
Mary...

45:26.578 --> 45:29.249
Listen, they found blood
near where we had the party.

45:29.411 --> 45:30.787
Okay? A lot of it.

45:31.578 --> 45:33.487
This is my dad.
You can talk to him.

45:33.644 --> 45:35.985
Mary, please, anything.

45:36.110 --> 45:37.349
Frank is like a son to me.

45:40.444 --> 45:41.443
After I came--

45:41.511 --> 45:42.750
How can I help you, Sheriff?

45:42.910 --> 45:45.081
The young lady
can answer for herself.

45:45.244 --> 45:46.813
Answer what, exactly?

45:52.110 --> 45:53.883
You're as gracious as ever, Eli.

45:54.744 --> 45:58.483
You come here unannounced
and uninvited.

45:58.644 --> 46:01.121
I'll remind you I don't need
an invitation.

46:01.277 --> 46:03.619
Piece of property is right
in the middle of my county.

46:04.578 --> 46:07.146
Now I got a boy missing,
and I understand

46:07.311 --> 46:09.448
that you've got two girls
missing as well.

46:09.611 --> 46:12.020
I'm sorry for your loss,
Sheriff,

46:12.177 --> 46:14.314
but my girls are accounted for,

46:14.477 --> 46:17.478
and unless you come here
with evidence that they are related,

46:17.644 --> 46:19.349
I don't see how we
can be of assistance.

46:19.511 --> 46:21.511
See, here's what I don't get, Eli--

46:21.678 --> 46:24.019
You live this wonderfully
wholesome life

46:24.177 --> 46:25.553
in the service of God.

46:26.311 --> 46:29.619
So why wouldn't you want
to be of assistance, huh?

46:31.511 --> 46:34.489
The fact is, boy, I'd hate
to see how a couple of murders

46:34.644 --> 46:38.110
could impact people running
to buy your jams and quilts.

46:39.644 --> 46:41.588
So let me ask my questions,
I'll be on my way.

46:43.277 --> 46:45.084
Mary? Mary!

46:51.277 --> 46:54.414
If you wish to question
our community

46:54.578 --> 46:57.351
or enter our private property,

46:59.277 --> 47:02.255
I'm sure your courts will
give you the proper permission.

47:02.411 --> 47:04.389
Then I'll be back
with a warrant, Eli.

47:05.644 --> 47:06.950
You can count on it.

47:11.344 --> 47:12.686
<i>Trevor!</i>

47:28.511 --> 47:29.454
Stop!

47:29.578 --> 47:30.577
He's a liar!

47:30.644 --> 47:33.520
He's a molester! Stop!
Stop! Come back!

47:33.678 --> 47:35.622
Please! Stop!

47:35.743 --> 47:36.742
Let me go!

47:36.777 --> 47:38.914
Stop, please, come back!

47:44.511 --> 47:47.648
For turning her back on
the holy city of New Bethlehem,

47:47.810 --> 47:50.448
<i>for attempting to bring lies
into our midst,</i>

47:50.611 --> 47:55.077
<i>from this moment forth,
Ruth Warren shall be shunned</i>

47:55.244 --> 47:56.483
- by the children of the light.
- No.

47:56.644 --> 47:59.247
<i>Your very family
will consider you dead.</i>

47:59.411 --> 48:02.014
<i>You shall not be spoken to.
You shall not be seen.</i>

48:02.177 --> 48:03.519
You shall not be heard.

48:07.810 --> 48:10.152
<i>You killed them both, didn't you?</i>

48:10.311 --> 48:12.619
You killed them both!

48:12.743 --> 48:14.551
You're a liar!

48:15.144 --> 48:18.645
Ruth Warren,
in the name of God the Father

48:18.810 --> 48:21.981
and his son Jesus, you are renounced

48:22.144 --> 48:24.315
<i>by the holy city of New Bethlehem.</i>

48:24.477 --> 48:26.318
<i>- You are shunned!</i>
- No!

48:26.477 --> 48:27.977
Shunned! Shunned!

48:28.144 --> 48:30.452
Father, help me! Father, please!

48:30.611 --> 48:32.111
<i>He's a liar!</i>

48:32.277 --> 48:34.016
He violated Abby and Hannah!

48:34.177 --> 48:35.211
He's a liar!

48:35.977 --> 48:36.977
He's a liar!

48:43.611 --> 48:48.316
The punishment for giving
shelter to the shunned

48:48.477 --> 48:50.352
<i>shall be eternal banishment</i>

48:50.511 --> 48:53.148
from the heavenly womb
of New Bethlehem.

48:53.311 --> 48:55.652
<i>This is the word of the elders.</i>

48:55.810 --> 48:57.685
This is the word of God!

49:16.810 --> 49:19.152
Trevor, I'm out of here, man.

49:20.010 --> 49:21.009
See you, Pete.

49:25.743 --> 49:26.585
Trevor?

49:27.810 --> 49:28.844
Mary.

49:29.643 --> 49:31.315
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

49:32.710 --> 49:33.709
What's going on?

49:44.578 --> 49:46.419
Hey, Mary...

49:47.244 --> 49:48.653
you're safe, okay?

49:51.578 --> 49:53.146
How am I going to find Ruth?

49:53.311 --> 49:54.982
I got a couple ideas.

49:55.144 --> 49:56.486
She wouldn't be the first
shunned communer

49:56.643 --> 49:58.280
to walk into town
with no place to go.

50:20.743 --> 50:22.085
Are you okay?

50:22.244 --> 50:23.381
Yeah.

50:25.910 --> 50:27.183
<i>Trevor's gonna help us.</i>

50:29.110 --> 50:30.610
He knows where my mother lives.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.755
- Hi.
- Hey.

50:48.777 --> 50:50.255
I'll be here.

50:50.411 --> 50:51.911
Thanks, Trevor.

51:08.843 --> 51:09.877
Hi.

51:15.144 --> 51:16.587
Mary.

51:19.277 --> 51:21.312
- This is Ruth.
- I know.

51:24.144 --> 51:25.678
Please, come inside. Come.

51:42.377 --> 51:44.446
I've been watching you
all these years.

51:45.877 --> 51:47.253
That's why I never
left this town.

51:47.411 --> 51:49.513
I wanted to be able
to see you grow up,

51:50.311 --> 51:52.084
even if it were from afar.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.186
And I see it in your eyes.

51:55.344 --> 51:57.514
You're waking up to the charade
that's New Bethlehem.

51:57.677 --> 51:59.795
Why didn't you talk to me?
Why didn't you let me know?

51:59.810 --> 52:01.981
I wanted to.
I tried to take you with me.

52:02.144 --> 52:04.587
But they--
They stopped me.

52:05.610 --> 52:06.485
Father.

52:06.643 --> 52:08.917
No, not your father.

52:10.743 --> 52:11.880
Elder Beacon.

52:16.643 --> 52:19.315
He's an insecure man
who will lie and cheat

52:19.476 --> 52:22.250
to keep whatever power he has
over New Bethlehem.

52:26.743 --> 52:28.085
Even murder?

52:28.244 --> 52:30.153
I wouldn't be surprised.

52:34.411 --> 52:35.320
Does anyone know you're here?

52:35.476 --> 52:36.579
No.

52:44.144 --> 52:47.315
<i>- Who is it?
- Elder Stone.</i>

52:52.643 --> 52:53.985
Where are they?

52:55.410 --> 52:56.286
The window.

52:57.144 --> 52:58.450
<i>Get out!</i>

53:00.144 --> 53:01.121
Where is she?

53:01.277 --> 53:02.618
What are you talking about?

53:02.777 --> 53:03.982
You're a liar!

53:04.144 --> 53:05.087
It's stuck.

53:05.810 --> 53:08.481
- Mary?!
<i>- You can't do this!</i>

53:08.643 --> 53:14.350
As long as the Lord governs
my actions, I can do no wrong.

53:15.177 --> 53:16.280
Mary?

53:16.443 --> 53:18.580
<i>You're only making it
more difficult on yourself.</i>

53:19.277 --> 53:20.948
<i>There's no one here, Eli.</i>

53:36.710 --> 53:37.847
Get in.

53:47.077 --> 53:48.020
Come in?

53:49.277 --> 53:52.153
Hey, I made up a bed for you
in the guest room.

53:52.311 --> 53:55.289
<i>My dad's working tonight.
He won't be back till morning.</i>

53:55.443 --> 53:57.478
I think your friend Ruth
is already asleep.

53:57.643 --> 53:59.416
<i>Are you feeling better?</i>

54:00.244 --> 54:01.482
Good.

54:02.743 --> 54:04.016
What are all these?

54:04.177 --> 54:06.654
They're from swim meets
and track and field,

54:06.810 --> 54:08.311
stuff like that, you know.

54:09.643 --> 54:12.917
No, we never really had
competitions.

54:14.277 --> 54:15.152
Right.

54:15.311 --> 54:17.982
Commune. Stupid me.

54:18.144 --> 54:21.145
You say that a lot,
you call yourself stupid.

54:22.010 --> 54:23.487
You shouldn't. You're not.

54:23.643 --> 54:26.348
I guess when you hear something
enough, it kind of sticks.

54:31.144 --> 54:32.644
If you told
your father everything,

54:32.810 --> 54:34.515
what do you think he would do?

54:36.177 --> 54:38.415
I think he would raid
the commune.

54:39.843 --> 54:41.616
He wants to shut it down.

54:41.777 --> 54:43.153
You don't have to go back there.

54:43.310 --> 54:44.913
You found your mother.
You can...

54:45.777 --> 54:47.278
stay.

55:01.147 --> 55:04.382
<i>I wear a poker face so well</i>

55:07.914 --> 55:12.181
<i>That even Mother couldn't tell</i>

55:12.214 --> 55:15.882
<i>And my baby's so vain</i>

55:15.915 --> 55:19.081
<i>She is almost a mirror</i>
- Are you sure?

55:19.114 --> 55:22.348
<i>And the sound of her name</i>

55:22.381 --> 55:25.882
<i>Sends a permanent shiver</i>

55:25.914 --> 55:29.316
<i>Down my spine</i>

55:31.982 --> 55:36.882
<i>Down my spine...</i>

55:37.144 --> 55:38.450
You did what?

55:38.577 --> 55:39.919
I thought they'd be safer here.

55:40.077 --> 55:41.520
Bringing them here like this?

55:41.677 --> 55:43.746
<i>I'm in the middle of an investigation.</i>

55:43.910 --> 55:46.427
- What was I supposed to do?
- Stay away from them, that's what.

55:46.476 --> 55:48.579
They're witnesses, Trevor,
and I'm bringing them in.

56:00.810 --> 56:01.981
<i>Where are they?</i>

56:02.144 --> 56:03.587
I don't know.

56:06.677 --> 56:08.313
Mary, I don't understand.

56:08.476 --> 56:09.715
We weren't safe there.

56:10.743 --> 56:13.983
As angry as I am at my father
and as much as I detest Rebekah,

56:14.144 --> 56:16.019
we still have brothers
and sisters here.

56:16.177 --> 56:17.745
And you think
we'll be safe there?

56:33.977 --> 56:35.420
Mary, I can't go back there.

56:35.577 --> 56:37.612
My father will protect us.

56:37.777 --> 56:39.652
He did so long ago
when we were born,

56:39.810 --> 56:41.412
and he will do so again.

56:42.910 --> 56:44.649
I'll see to it.

56:45.643 --> 56:47.144
Come on.

56:58.276 --> 56:59.720
Mary,

56:59.843 --> 57:01.320
thank goodness you're alive.

57:01.476 --> 57:02.647
Are you all right?

57:02.810 --> 57:04.981
- I'm fine.
- Where were you?

57:06.343 --> 57:07.480
It does not concern you.

57:07.643 --> 57:10.348
Father, for all the deceits
I may have foisted upon you,

57:10.510 --> 57:12.613
yours to me
remains the greatest.

57:12.777 --> 57:16.017
But I will forgive you because
the Bible tells me to do so.

57:17.677 --> 57:19.245
And now you shall do
the same for me.

57:23.143 --> 57:24.053
No.

57:24.176 --> 57:25.086
Mary--

57:25.243 --> 57:26.585
- Father--
- Get out.

57:26.743 --> 57:29.311
By harboring this girl,
we could all be shunned.

57:29.476 --> 57:31.977
Ruth is my friend, and we will
not turn our backs upon her.

57:32.143 --> 57:33.985
You will listen to my word!

57:34.143 --> 57:35.644
<i>I speak for both of us!</i>

57:35.810 --> 57:37.446
Whenever you stand praying,
forgive.

57:37.610 --> 57:39.747
If you have anything
against anyone, forgive,

57:39.910 --> 57:42.444
because your Father
who sits in Heaven

57:42.610 --> 57:44.178
forgives your transgressions.

57:44.343 --> 57:47.514
And if you cannot forgive,
neither will the Almighty.

57:49.343 --> 57:51.617
If you're truly
sworn to the Bible,

57:51.777 --> 57:53.982
now's the time
to start acting like it.

57:58.810 --> 58:00.685
You'll stay up here
for the night.

58:01.443 --> 58:03.443
Make sure you don't
leave the room.

58:10.410 --> 58:11.353
What?

58:11.510 --> 58:13.146
I've just never heard anybody

58:13.310 --> 58:15.288
talk to their father
the way you did.

58:15.443 --> 58:17.648
Tomorrow's
our 18th birthday, Ruth.

58:17.810 --> 58:19.947
We're not kids anymore.

58:25.109 --> 58:27.553
If you choose to wake
with the Devil, so be it.

58:28.143 --> 58:30.121
But my children and I will not.

58:30.276 --> 58:33.618
If you utter one word
of their presence here...

58:38.176 --> 58:39.153
<i>Children.</i>

58:54.643 --> 58:56.245
Ruth?

59:20.510 --> 59:21.453
Ruth?

59:34.276 --> 59:35.583
Ruth.

59:59.743 --> 01:00:01.277
The barn.

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:30.251
Ruth, what are we doing?

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:31.978
Looking for proof.

01:00:32.143 --> 01:00:34.417
Ruth, this is crazy.

01:00:34.577 --> 01:00:36.521
I have already
been shunned, Mary.

01:00:36.677 --> 01:00:38.279
What else is there?

01:00:38.443 --> 01:00:39.977
If I could expose him
as the killer,

01:00:40.143 --> 01:00:42.121
my family will take me back.

01:00:44.343 --> 01:00:45.514
Oh, God.

01:00:46.577 --> 01:00:47.850
He's coming.

01:00:47.976 --> 01:00:49.318
He's coming. Let's go.

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:53.586
Don't. No, come on.

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:00.515
Come on.

01:02:13.243 --> 01:02:14.414
Mary Brown.

01:02:16.443 --> 01:02:19.284
The Devil still haunts
your soul, child.

01:02:30.842 --> 01:02:32.445
Ruth Warren!

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.247
<i>The eye of God sees you!</i>

01:03:02.777 --> 01:03:05.584
Please let me in!
Father, let me in!

01:03:08.677 --> 01:03:10.621
<i>I can't.</i>

01:03:11.443 --> 01:03:13.148
Please open the door!

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:15.310
Please open the door,
I'm begging you!

01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:26.416
Ruth!

01:03:29.143 --> 01:03:31.087
I can't send you away.

01:03:32.143 --> 01:03:33.086
Father.

01:04:08.976 --> 01:04:10.511
Leave me alone!

01:06:36.243 --> 01:06:37.152
Mary!

01:06:38.776 --> 01:06:40.776
<i>The day of reckoning has arrived.</i>

01:06:42.809 --> 01:06:46.253
The Drommelkind has struck openly.

01:06:46.842 --> 01:06:48.979
It is Mary Brown.

01:06:49.143 --> 01:06:52.314
Her birthday arrives tonight
at the stroke of midnight.

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:55.454
Summon all the God-fearing
to the chapel.

01:06:57.043 --> 01:06:58.453
<i>Elders...</i>

01:06:58.609 --> 01:07:00.485
<i>prepare the horses.</i>

01:07:04.276 --> 01:07:06.151
Rebekah,
what are you doing here?

01:07:06.276 --> 01:07:07.219
We're staying here tonight.

01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:09.287
The children are sleeping
in the loft.

01:07:10.076 --> 01:07:11.315
Jacob and I have quarreled.

01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:13.317
I have no time
to discuss your marriage.

01:07:13.476 --> 01:07:14.817
Now where is Mary?

01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:19.151
Her soul is in grave danger,

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:21.651
as is yours and your children
and all of New Bethlehem.

01:07:21.809 --> 01:07:24.310
I do not know.
She did not return home last night.

01:07:24.476 --> 01:07:26.249
You lie, I have already seen her

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.251
with the glint
of the Devil in her eye!

01:07:29.609 --> 01:07:32.178
Where does your allegiance
truly lie?

01:07:33.943 --> 01:07:35.148
Where would Jacob take her?

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:39.015
If he had her in his possession,
I would say Sarah Maker's.

01:07:45.143 --> 01:07:46.314
<i>Mary!</i>

01:07:48.143 --> 01:07:49.518
Mary!

01:08:35.276 --> 01:08:36.651
Oh, Mary.

01:08:37.841 --> 01:08:38.841
Oh...

01:08:40.143 --> 01:08:41.348
are you all right?

01:08:41.509 --> 01:08:42.645
I'm afraid.

01:08:42.809 --> 01:08:44.752
Don't worry, I'm here.

01:08:44.908 --> 01:08:46.182
<i>Mother Maker!</i>

01:08:48.442 --> 01:08:50.352
Jacob Brown. You cannot be here.

01:08:50.509 --> 01:08:52.453
Look at her.
Her seizures are getting worse.

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:54.144
They've just been here
looking for her.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:56.148
Good, then they won't
be back again, will they?

01:08:56.176 --> 01:08:58.245
- But I can't--
- But nothing!

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:00.410
18 years ago,
I protected your daughter.

01:09:00.576 --> 01:09:02.576
Now you will repay the favor.

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:13.149
<i>She needs a doctor.</i>

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.446
I must go into town and get some help.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.609
I fear evil spirit's
taken this girl's soul.

01:09:17.776 --> 01:09:19.453
- Look at her.
<i>- There are no evil spirits,</i>

01:09:19.475 --> 01:09:22.419
and there is no Drommelkind!
It's a fairy tale!

01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:25.247
Now I have a daughter who
needs serious medical help.

01:09:25.408 --> 01:09:27.444
I'm not going to stand by
and watch her die.

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:31.019
Now you, you go to the church
so as to allay suspicion.

01:09:31.176 --> 01:09:33.346
Sarah, you stay with Mary.
I'm going for help.

01:09:33.509 --> 01:09:36.180
- But she needs to be purified.
- No, she needs a doctor.

01:09:36.343 --> 01:09:37.979
Elder Beacon would let her die.

01:09:38.143 --> 01:09:39.620
Now you stay with her.

01:09:48.442 --> 01:09:49.852
Mary...

01:09:54.642 --> 01:09:55.949
Mary?

01:09:58.809 --> 01:10:01.014
Mary, can you hear me?

01:10:02.742 --> 01:10:04.311
I want to help you.

01:10:04.475 --> 01:10:06.578
You're in danger
of the Dark One.

01:10:10.809 --> 01:10:12.616
I'm going to find you
the help you need.

01:10:39.842 --> 01:10:41.047
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:52.685
We must act now.

01:10:52.842 --> 01:10:54.252
<i>Time is sh-</i>

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:04.612
Mary is at our house.

01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:08.249
Our faith has been rewarded.

01:11:08.409 --> 01:11:10.478
The Drommelkind has been found.

01:11:21.442 --> 01:11:22.681
Circle the house!

01:11:26.143 --> 01:11:28.552
As long as you stand firm,

01:11:29.442 --> 01:11:33.580
the evil within cannot escape.

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:38.453
As for the Drommelkind,

01:11:39.509 --> 01:11:40.953
I will face it myself.

01:11:49.342 --> 01:11:52.253
<i>Sheriff Stevens, we've got
a 911 call from New Bethlehem.</i>

01:12:11.909 --> 01:12:13.409
From the abyss you came,

01:12:13.576 --> 01:12:15.986
and to the abyss
you shall return.

01:12:16.143 --> 01:12:20.314
You shall not enter our world,
beast of Satan.

01:12:21.809 --> 01:12:25.446
Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.

01:12:25.609 --> 01:12:29.314
Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.

01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:33.317
<i>Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.</i>

01:12:33.475 --> 01:12:37.181
<i>Praise be to the Lord in whom we trust.</i>

01:12:37.342 --> 01:12:39.116
<i>Praise be to the Lord...</i>

01:12:39.275 --> 01:12:42.310
The bargain which you struck
for this flesh

01:12:42.475 --> 01:12:44.578
is rendered null and void

01:12:44.742 --> 01:12:49.982
by the power vested in me
by God Almighty.

01:12:50.143 --> 01:12:53.643
You cannot fool
a soldier of Christ

01:12:53.809 --> 01:12:57.309
with your fair face,
Drommelkind!

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:03.087
Slither back into the slime

01:13:03.242 --> 01:13:05.914
from whence
you were spawned, demon!

01:13:16.842 --> 01:13:20.308
Praise be to the Lord
in whom we trust.

01:13:21.342 --> 01:13:24.650
Do you know why New Bethlehem
follows me, Mary?

01:13:25.876 --> 01:13:28.479
They follow me
because they know the sound

01:13:28.642 --> 01:13:30.313
of their master's voice.

01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:37.144
The people outside
are like dogs, Mary.

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:40.287
<i>The greatest gift you can
give another human being</i>

01:13:40.442 --> 01:13:42.818
is the sound of their master's voice.

01:13:57.342 --> 01:13:58.615
Look out.

01:14:01.475 --> 01:14:02.646
<i>Mary!</i>

01:14:02.809 --> 01:14:04.343
- Mary!
- Hold him!

01:14:04.509 --> 01:14:05.384
Mary!

01:14:38.676 --> 01:14:41.313
Our father who... who art in...

01:14:41.475 --> 01:14:43.953
Is there something
you want to tell me, child?

01:14:50.409 --> 01:14:53.250
Hallowed be thy name.

01:15:00.043 --> 01:15:01.418
Demon!

01:15:06.142 --> 01:15:07.620
Mary.

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.142
Come on.

01:15:21.776 --> 01:15:23.515
You're insane.

01:15:59.809 --> 01:16:00.843
Hi, Mary.

01:16:02.242 --> 01:16:03.345
You remember me?

01:16:05.142 --> 01:16:07.984
I know what you've been through.

01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:11.216
But it would really help
if you could tell me

01:16:11.342 --> 01:16:13.752
anything you remember
about what happened.

01:16:16.142 --> 01:16:17.916
25 minutes.

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.480
25 minutes what?

01:16:22.642 --> 01:16:24.347
Until I become the Drommelkind.

01:16:24.509 --> 01:16:25.986
What?

01:16:26.142 --> 01:16:27.983
My birthdays at midnight.

01:16:28.142 --> 01:16:30.279
It's when Satan will take
possession of my soul.

01:16:30.442 --> 01:16:31.613
No, no, no, no.

01:16:31.776 --> 01:16:33.515
I'll become one of his soldiers.

01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:36.153
I'll become
unimaginably powerful.

01:16:36.309 --> 01:16:38.651
No, that's not gonna happen.

01:16:38.809 --> 01:16:41.286
- You have to kill me.
- Mary.

01:16:41.442 --> 01:16:43.317
You have to kill me
before it's too late.

01:16:43.475 --> 01:16:45.612
Relax, relax, okay?

01:16:45.776 --> 01:16:46.685
Sheriff?

01:16:48.909 --> 01:16:50.409
I'll be right back.

01:17:11.609 --> 01:17:13.245
<i>You're almost free.</i>

01:17:17.642 --> 01:17:19.415
Stay away from me. I'll hurt you.

01:17:19.576 --> 01:17:20.951
No, you won't.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.142
You were weak, Mary.

01:17:29.309 --> 01:17:32.617
You are sickly,
plagued by your fits.

01:17:32.776 --> 01:17:36.481
The prophecy said only one
of you six girls would live,

01:17:36.642 --> 01:17:39.483
only the strongest
would survive.

01:17:39.642 --> 01:17:42.915
I prayed for God to heal you.

01:17:45.242 --> 01:17:47.481
He turned his back on me.

01:17:47.642 --> 01:17:49.176
What did you do?

01:17:49.342 --> 01:17:52.650
I cursed his name,
renounced him.

01:17:54.908 --> 01:17:58.682
And then I was offered
the chance to keep you alive.

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.677
My beautiful Mary.

01:18:08.175 --> 01:18:10.312
You changed the prophecy.

01:18:10.475 --> 01:18:12.646
I made sure you were the one.

01:18:12.809 --> 01:18:14.309
No.

01:18:14.475 --> 01:18:15.680
- Yes.
- No.

01:18:15.842 --> 01:18:17.978
I've been in service to you.

01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:24.482
You are not gonna need
my help any longer.

01:18:25.509 --> 01:18:27.680
You will finally be free,

01:18:27.842 --> 01:18:30.843
your power complete.

01:18:31.008 --> 01:18:32.452
No.

01:18:32.609 --> 01:18:34.143
No. No.

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.344
- Oh, yes, Mary.
- No.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:44.483
You have a visitor.

01:18:55.275 --> 01:18:56.344
Hey.

01:18:57.342 --> 01:18:58.251
Hi.

01:18:59.008 --> 01:18:59.883
Hi.

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:06.177
Are you okay?

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.485
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:19:08.642 --> 01:19:09.983
I missed you.

01:19:10.142 --> 01:19:11.643
I missed you, too.

01:19:15.841 --> 01:19:17.478
What?

01:19:17.642 --> 01:19:18.676
- What is it?
- Shh.

01:19:21.008 --> 01:19:22.145
It's almost over.

01:19:22.309 --> 01:19:24.344
What are you talking ab-

01:19:51.342 --> 01:19:53.945
I guess there's some things
that don't change.

01:19:56.808 --> 01:19:58.684
You really are stupid.

01:19:58.841 --> 01:20:00.251
What?

01:20:22.576 --> 01:20:24.053
Please, sir,

01:20:24.175 --> 01:20:25.619
please, sir,

01:20:25.775 --> 01:20:28.481
we need to begin an exodus
from New Bethlehem.

01:20:35.475 --> 01:20:38.816
<i>God, our Father in Heaven,
protect me from this evil.</i>

01:20:58.425 --> 01:21:00.525
<i>My fire is wild</i>

01:21:04.091 --> 01:21:06.726
<i>My rage is deep</i>

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:12.693
<i>One black eye</i>

01:21:16.491 --> 01:21:19.193
<i>Busted teeth</i>

01:21:22.459 --> 01:21:24.260
<i>Feel my fury</i>

01:21:24.293 --> 01:21:26.593
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:21:28.292 --> 01:21:30.260
<i>You really light me up</i>

01:21:30.293 --> 01:21:33.160
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:21:33.409 --> 01:21:35.409
Last but hardly least.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.461
<i>Feel my pulse</i>

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.228
<i>My heart beats</i>

01:21:52.094 --> 01:21:55.061
<i>But the cancer's deep</i>

01:21:55.342 --> 01:21:58.183
It's time for your examination.

01:22:00.394 --> 01:22:04.261
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:06.396
<i>You really light me up</i>

01:22:06.429 --> 01:22:10.661
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:22:10.694 --> 01:22:12.529
<i>Feel my fury</i>

01:22:12.562 --> 01:22:16.062
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:22:16.095 --> 01:22:18.396
<i>You really light me up</i>

01:22:18.429 --> 01:22:21.229
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:22:25.329 --> 01:22:28.462
<i>And when you lied before</i>

01:22:28.495 --> 01:22:31.530
<i>You broke our tie before</i>

01:22:31.563 --> 01:22:35.262
<i>And then I tapped into a feeling</i>

01:22:35.295 --> 01:22:37.530
<i>That I could not ignore</i>

01:22:37.563 --> 01:22:40.563
<i>And when you lied before</i>

01:22:40.596 --> 01:22:43.697
<i>You broke our tie before</i>

01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:47.030
<i>And then I tapped into a feeling</i>

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:49.731
<i>That I could not ignore</i>

01:22:51.563 --> 01:22:53.263
<i>Feel my fury</i>

01:22:53.296 --> 01:22:56.764
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:22:56.797 --> 01:22:59.064
<i>You really light me up</i>

01:22:59.097 --> 01:23:03.464
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:23:03.497 --> 01:23:05.064
<i>Feel my fury</i>

01:23:05.097 --> 01:23:09.065
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:23:09.098 --> 01:23:11.032
<i>You really light me up</i>

01:23:11.064 --> 01:23:13.733
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh</i>

01:23:16.431 --> 01:23:19.466
<i>Fury, oh, fury, don't you misguide me</i>

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:25.432
<i>I need my wits to set me free</i>

01:23:27.765 --> 01:23:31.467
<i>Oh, fury, oh, fury,
don't you misguide me</i>

01:23:34.331 --> 01:23:37.500
<i>I need my wits to set me free</i>

01:23:40.433 --> 01:23:43.667
<i>Oh, fury, oh, fury,
don't you misguide me</i>

01:23:46.366 --> 01:23:49.600
<i>I need my wits to set me free</i>

01:23:50.305 --> 01:23:56.810
