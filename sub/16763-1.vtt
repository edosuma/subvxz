00:20.460 --> 00:22.460
Good evening, everyone,

00:22.550 --> 00:24.480
and welcome to a
Powell Pay-Per-View...

00:24.580 --> 00:25.580
television event!

00:25.680 --> 00:28.710
It's hard to believe,
but tonight's heavyweight fight...

00:28.810 --> 00:31.830
is the swan song for the grand
old Atlantic City Arena,

00:31.930 --> 00:34.960
the final event to be held
in this storied hall...

00:35.060 --> 00:38.090
before it is gutted
and completely renovated...

00:38.190 --> 00:42.260
as part of Gilbert Powell's
Millennium Hotel and Casino.

00:42.360 --> 00:46.430
I'm eager to go ringside
along with 14,000 fight fans...

00:46.530 --> 00:49.560
who have braved
Hurricane Jezebel to..

00:49.660 --> 00:51.660
Cut! Cut!

00:51.750 --> 00:53.730
Anthea, they want you to call it
a tropical storm, not a hurricane.

00:53.830 --> 00:55.830
But it is a hurricane.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.900
Yeah, well, it's also
a holiday weekend,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.030
so will you please just call it
a tropical storm, please?

01:01.130 --> 01:03.120
I love this town.
They even spin the weather.

01:03.220 --> 01:06.240
All right, listen. We gotta go live
on this one, so don't screw it up.

01:06.340 --> 01:09.370
And Al, I think that's Powell going
in there with Secretary Kirkland.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.460
Zoom in on them during the intro.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.370
Anyway, why can't I
do this from inside?

01:13.470 --> 01:14.590
All right, we're rolling.

01:14.690 --> 01:16.010
Why do I have to stand
out here like a...

01:16.110 --> 01:16.670
Five, four, three,

01:16.770 --> 01:18.760
- a weather bimbo?
- Two, one, go!

01:18.860 --> 01:20.860
Good evening, everyone,

01:20.940 --> 01:22.870
and welcome to a
Powell Pay-Per-View...

01:22.970 --> 01:23.970
television event.

01:24.070 --> 01:27.100
Well, the lucky ones are already
inside at the fight...

01:27.200 --> 01:30.230
as the first taste
of Tropical Storm Jezebel...

01:30.330 --> 01:35.440
lashes the boardwalk outside
the grand old Atlantic City Arena.

01:35.540 --> 01:38.570
It's hard to believe,
but tonight's heavyweight fight...

01:38.670 --> 01:40.650
is the swan song
for this storied hall.

01:40.750 --> 01:43.780
The final event to be held here
before it is gutted..

01:43.880 --> 01:45.870
What do we got?
Thirty, forty seconds?

01:45.970 --> 01:47.950
Where's Janine?
My hair looks like shit?

01:48.050 --> 01:51.010
I'm on TV? I'm on TV?

01:51.180 --> 01:53.170
Come on, for Christ's sake.
I'm on in 30 seconds. Will ya?

01:53.270 --> 01:54.660
I think people would vote
for this face. Don't you?

01:54.760 --> 01:55.250
Yeah, blind people.

01:55.350 --> 01:57.340
That's the only way
you get anywhere these days.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.480
You gotta get your big,
fat smile all over the tube.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.510
Hi. Rick Santoro.
Hello. Richard Santoro.

02:01.610 --> 02:03.610
I'm Ricky!

02:03.690 --> 02:04.930
Hey, you down on the fight yet?

02:05.030 --> 02:06.720
Oh, shit. I forgot.
You seen Jimmy George?

02:06.820 --> 02:07.630
Yeah, he's down in the tunnel.

02:07.730 --> 02:08.810
What tunnel? There's
a million tunnels.

02:08.910 --> 02:10.889
I don't know. The tunnel of love,
over by Tyler's dressing room.

02:10.990 --> 02:12.980
- Here, lay 50 for me.
- On who?

02:13.080 --> 02:15.930
On who? On the bag of
meat, on who! On Tyler!

02:16.030 --> 02:17.150
The whole 50?

02:17.250 --> 02:18.970
Oh, up yours, Mr High Roller...

02:19.070 --> 02:21.320
I mean, why don't you
just shoot it all?

02:21.420 --> 02:24.130
A hundred.

02:24.550 --> 02:27.510
For his work with troubled youth,

02:27.670 --> 02:30.700
take on the challenger,
Jose Pacifico Ruiz...

02:30.800 --> 02:33.680
in a classic 12-round
confrontation...

02:33.780 --> 02:34.870
Rolling in five,

02:34.970 --> 02:38.190
between a counterpuncher
and a brawler.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.090
Four, three, two, one.

02:40.190 --> 02:43.150
Hello? Hey, baby. How are you?

02:43.320 --> 02:46.280
I was hoping it'd be you. Yeah.

02:46.440 --> 02:50.609
Happy almost birthday.
Of course I'm still coming.

02:50.610 --> 02:53.640
I'm gonna be there
when it turns midnight.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.770
Oh, yes, yes, I'm bringing
something with me.

02:56.870 --> 02:58.870
It's a surprise.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.980
Well, if I told you, then..
That's right, baby.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.090
No. No way.
I'm not gonna give you a hint.

03:06.260 --> 03:08.260
No.. Shameless.

03:08.340 --> 03:11.370
Monique, you can't say
that on a cel phone.

03:11.470 --> 03:15.470
Yummy. All right,
I will give you a hint.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.970
I know you really want one, and...

03:18.070 --> 03:20.750
it's going to keep
you very, very warm.

03:20.850 --> 03:22.840
Give me five secs.
I'll call you back.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.920
Jimmy George, wait up a sec.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.950
Come on, Rick. I got
people waiting for me.

03:27.050 --> 03:28.050
Hey, that's Tyler!

03:28.150 --> 03:30.140
- What're you lookin' at?
- That's Tyler!

03:30.240 --> 03:31.290
Where d'you think you're goin'?

03:31.390 --> 03:33.270
The A.C. executioner is
standing right in front of me.

03:33.370 --> 03:34.570
Were you talkin' to him?

03:34.670 --> 03:36.390
Hey, do I ask what you do at work?

03:36.490 --> 03:39.520
No shit. The man bets on his
own fights. Now that's confidence.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.610
- Come on, what do you want, Rick?
- What's up your ass?

03:41.710 --> 03:45.780
- I'm havin' a bad day, okay?
- I want five large on Tyler.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.100
Five large? You got it
on you? Let me see it.

03:47.200 --> 03:47.860
What are you, a bank now?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.710
I gotta put up front
for the privilege...

03:49.810 --> 03:51.050
of betting on a lousy fight?

03:51.090 --> 03:51.950
Yes, you do. Take it or leave it,

03:52.050 --> 03:53.080
because I don't need
the aggravation...

03:53.180 --> 03:55.160
Have I ever stiffed you
one time, Jimmy? Name one time.

03:55.260 --> 03:56.500
No, no, you never stiffed me.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.290
It's just that you
take forever to pay.

03:58.390 --> 03:59.390
All right.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.420
Five grand. I'll see that
a year from next Christmas.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
The guy is ten-to-one to win,

04:02.620 --> 04:04.550
all right? I can't make any
money if I lay less than that.

04:04.650 --> 04:06.630
I got a very...
very important birthday.

04:06.730 --> 04:07.880
I wanna buy one of those...

04:07.980 --> 04:10.800
shorty fur coats they got at the
designer shops over at Caesar's.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.890
You know how overpriced they are.

04:12.990 --> 04:14.970
Listen, I missed the part
where any of this is my problem.

04:15.070 --> 04:17.070
I made a promise, Jimmy.
I gave my word to someone.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.730
A man's word means nothing...

04:18.829 --> 04:21.230
to you, in your
profession? Please. Come on.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.500
Cash means something to me.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.360
Words mean something
to somebody else...

04:24.460 --> 04:26.440
All right. Don't move.
I'll be right back.

04:26.540 --> 04:29.920
- Cyrus!
- Hey. Hey! Hey!

04:30.710 --> 04:33.840
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

04:40.100 --> 04:43.130
Hey, hold it, pal.
Where do you think you're goin'?

04:43.230 --> 04:46.260
- On the job, sport.
- Oh, shit. Sorry, sir.

04:46.360 --> 04:50.860
- You need a hand?
- On, no, no. I got it.

04:51.570 --> 04:52.570
Shit!

04:52.670 --> 04:54.600
You kinda went the stupid
way, didn't you, Cyrus?

04:54.700 --> 04:57.730
I got a cut. I need a medic.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.790
Medic. Medic. Medic. Medic.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.180
Well, that's a start.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.980
What? Wh-Wh-What do you want?

05:04.080 --> 05:07.040
- What do you think?
- No!

05:07.210 --> 05:08.210
Yes!

05:08.310 --> 05:10.240
Now, come on, this is
not fair. Man, come on!

05:10.340 --> 05:12.340
Call a cop.

05:12.420 --> 05:16.220
- Hey!
- No! Get outta here, man!

05:16.590 --> 05:18.550
You got the wrong
attitude about all...

05:18.650 --> 05:20.660
of this, Cyrus. You
gotta keep positive.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.130
See, when we have
these little visits,

05:23.230 --> 05:24.840
I allow you, I permit you,

05:24.940 --> 05:26.920
I give you the opportunity...

05:27.020 --> 05:31.860
to pay for all the extra
police work that you create.

05:32.230 --> 05:33.910
Now, doesn't it feel nice...

05:34.010 --> 05:36.310
to contribute to
society for a change?

05:36.410 --> 05:39.380
Come on! Don't do that!
Oh, come on!

05:39.530 --> 05:42.560
You got a bad attitude,
you hear, my friend?

05:42.660 --> 05:44.650
What makes you think
you're better than me?

05:44.750 --> 05:49.170
Friends, Cyrus.
Everybody loves Rick Santoro.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Jimmy George!

05:53.090 --> 05:55.090
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

05:55.170 --> 05:57.170
Three grand on Tyler.
This one's a little sticky...

05:57.260 --> 06:00.290
- 2900. I don't want this one.
- Why?

06:00.390 --> 06:04.460
- There's blood all over it.
- Well, aren't you delicate.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.630
Tyler! Neptune High, right?
Check it out, right here!

06:08.730 --> 06:09.900
Go, Sea Devils!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.800
You and me, Tyler!
Yeah! Go, Tyler!

06:12.900 --> 06:13.900
Get lost.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.930
Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler! Go!

06:16.030 --> 06:20.030
Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler!
Go, Tyler!

06:20.200 --> 06:23.230
Lincoln Tyler! Lincoln Tyler!
Lincoln!

06:23.330 --> 06:26.360
- My lucky number seven.
- That's a new one, mister.

06:26.460 --> 06:29.480
You are sunshine on a stormy day.
You should work in the casino.

06:29.580 --> 06:31.570
- I'm gonna. I mean, I wanna.
- Yeah?

06:31.670 --> 06:33.650
- This is just sort of temporary.
- Let me make a few phone calls.

06:33.750 --> 06:34.100
Would you?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.761
Yeah. Do you know how
to deal blackjack?

06:35.840 --> 06:37.830
- No.
- All right. Call me. I'm Rick.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.910
This goes straight
to my special phone line.

06:40.010 --> 06:42.970
- Bye, mister. Bye!
- Hello?

06:43.140 --> 06:45.140
Oh, yeah. No, hi, babe.

06:45.220 --> 06:48.250
No, I just had something
stuck in my throat.

06:48.350 --> 06:50.340
Well, tell him to go to sleep.
I'll talk to him in the morning.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.270
No, I can't.

06:53.570 --> 06:55.420
That's why. All right, tell him I...

06:55.520 --> 06:57.640
love him and I'll...
No, Angela, don't...

06:57.740 --> 06:59.720
Hi, Mikey. I know.
No, I didn't forget.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.850
I haven't seen him yet, but as soon
as I do, I'll ask him, all right?

07:02.950 --> 07:05.980
All right. I love you too.
No, no, don't put Mommy...

07:06.080 --> 07:09.110
Hi. I don't know. Late.
Later than that. Later than that.

07:09.210 --> 07:12.230
Yeah, sure, if they're open.
With extra cheese?

07:12.330 --> 07:15.360
I don't care. I don't care!
I'm not gonna eat it!

07:15.460 --> 07:16.410
Pepperoni, sausage,
Canadian bacon...

07:16.510 --> 07:19.530
Listen, why don't you just get
the deluxe and save time, all right?

07:19.630 --> 07:21.620
Look, I got business.
Call me back in five. There he is!

07:21.720 --> 07:23.700
- You got a pass, sir?
- It's all right. He's with me.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.880
- There's the man whose life I want!
- You're late.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.910
You know me. Always
upholding justice.

07:30.010 --> 07:31.000
When did you get in?

07:31.100 --> 07:33.090
Last night. I flew in from Norfolk
with Powell and the secretary.

07:33.190 --> 07:34.190
Hey, is that him?

07:34.290 --> 07:36.220
Tuck in your shirt and
I'll introduce you.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.740
Jesus! I get you a front row seat,

07:37.840 --> 07:39.350
and you show up
lookin' like Don Ho.

07:39.450 --> 07:40.890
Well, pardon my savoir faire,

07:40.990 --> 07:43.520
Admiral. Why are you so
uptight? It's fight night!

07:43.620 --> 07:45.600
I'm runnin' security tonight.
I got a lot on my mind.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.690
Kirkland's high profile.
He's all over the news...

07:47.790 --> 07:49.770
and brings the nutcases
out of the woodwork.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.900
He's a real publicity hound.
Look at this.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.030
And now, the distinguished
secretary of defense...

07:56.130 --> 08:00.970
of the United States of America,
Mr Charles Kirkland.

08:02.380 --> 08:06.460
And seated next to him is a man
that needs no introduction.

08:06.560 --> 08:10.630
Great idea. Put a flashing light
on your head while you're at it.

08:10.730 --> 08:15.150
Your host for the evening,
Mr Gilbert Powell!

08:19.070 --> 08:21.030
Maintain focus
on the principal, mister.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.100
Sorry, Commander.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.180
- Got your locator on?
- Yes, sir.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.270
- Go cover the west exit.
- Yes, sir.

08:26.370 --> 08:29.400
And throw in a couple martinis
while you're at it.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.570
- It's fight night.
- Look. See that blip? That's him.

08:33.669 --> 08:37.669
Look at you, 007.
Man, I'm so impressed.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.820
I wanna get your
autograph or somethin'.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.950
I can picture us like yesterday,
workin' summers on the beach,

08:43.049 --> 08:45.040
carrying the oars back
across the hot sand.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.120
No, me I can picture
carrying the oars.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.880
You were usually
under the boardwalk...

08:48.980 --> 08:50.301
with a cute piece of jailbait.

08:50.350 --> 08:51.500
It's me, your lucky number!

08:51.600 --> 08:53.380
Listen, I gotta hit
you up for something.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
Mikey's crazy about...

08:54.580 --> 08:56.510
submarines right now. I mean,
everything's submarines with him,

08:56.610 --> 08:58.590
and he wanted me to ask you
if you'd get him a ride on one.

08:58.690 --> 09:00.480
Well, sure, Rick. We'll
dock the Polaris...

09:00.580 --> 09:01.720
right out at the steel pier.

09:01.820 --> 09:02.180
Come on. This is the kind...

09:02.280 --> 09:02.760
of thing godfathers
do. Come with us.

09:02.860 --> 09:05.890
I promise I won't
embarrass the brass.

09:05.990 --> 09:06.610
I haven't been on the water...

09:06.710 --> 09:07.980
since the Renville, but I'll
pull some strings for Michael.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.060
- How's Angela?
- Fat, fantastic. I love her.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.150
What about the other one?
What's her name? Candy?

09:12.250 --> 09:15.510
Monique. Skinny,
mean, expensive.

09:15.610 --> 09:17.360
I love her.

09:17.460 --> 09:21.210
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Come on.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.720
Yeah! Look at... Yeah, baby!

09:27.890 --> 09:30.760
Go, baby! Yeah!

09:33.100 --> 09:35.090
You got a wife, a kid,
a house in Margate,

09:35.190 --> 09:37.170
a girlfriend and an apartment.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.260
Bein' a cop pays six figures now?

09:39.360 --> 09:41.340
I save coupons.
Are you my conscience?

09:41.440 --> 09:42.160
You could use one.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.460
Does Angela know about Monique?

09:43.530 --> 09:45.200
See, now there's a
good idea. What are...

09:45.300 --> 09:46.560
you gonna do, turn me in again?

09:46.660 --> 09:48.120
That was just to
teach you a lesson.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.680
You never shoplifted
again, did you?

09:49.780 --> 09:51.950
No, I never got caught again.
Angela's happy, trust me.

09:52.050 --> 09:52.810
Angela's not happy.

09:52.910 --> 09:55.000
She's just uninformed.
Maybe if she knew...

09:55.100 --> 09:56.980
the rules, she could
play the game too.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.070
Listen, if Angela knew the rules,
there would be no game.

09:59.170 --> 10:01.150
Rule number one:
Angela can't know all the rules.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.250
Look, I'm not like you,

10:02.350 --> 10:04.280
Kevin. I can't have sex with
the same woman for 20 years.

10:04.380 --> 10:04.960
It's not natural.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.370
Terry likes to talk
to me during sex.

10:06.470 --> 10:10.600
Last night, she called
me from a hotel.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.430
Go, Lincoln!

10:18.980 --> 10:20.970
Does that seem right to you?

10:21.070 --> 10:23.050
Kevin, that is right
in so many ways.

10:23.150 --> 10:25.190
No, I mean, who's she with?
Not the guy next to her.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.220
Beautiful woman alone at a fight.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.990
Sexy lady. What's the problem?

10:31.490 --> 10:33.480
You've gotta get outta this town.
You know that, don't you?

10:33.580 --> 10:34.580
Would you stop going...

10:34.680 --> 10:36.610
all Jiminy Cricket on me. You
can't help yourself, can you?

10:36.710 --> 10:38.690
No, really. I mean,
get your butt down to D.C.

10:38.790 --> 10:40.630
I call a few guys I
know from Annapolis,

10:40.730 --> 10:41.820
arrange some interviews,

10:41.920 --> 10:43.900
get you a G.S. rating,
you're in our programme.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.370
Bureau of Diplomatic Security...

10:45.470 --> 10:48.080
pays double what your salary
is here, and the money's clean.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.160
All right, all right. You gotta fix
my life later. I got money on this.

10:50.260 --> 10:51.260
I wanna stay in a good mood.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.290
You know, keep positive.
Because this is fight night!

10:53.390 --> 10:55.370
Don't make Michael grow up here.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.460
This isn't a beach town
any more. It's a sewer.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.590
But it's my sewer, Jiminy,
and I love it.

11:00.690 --> 11:01.960
I kick around about
six square blocks.

11:02.060 --> 11:02.670
Everybody knows me.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.830
I got the whole town
wired. Someday if I...

11:04.930 --> 11:06.840
manage to get my
face on TV a few times,

11:06.940 --> 11:08.490
maybe I'll run for
mayor or something,

11:08.590 --> 11:09.970
but that's as far as I want to go.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.050
Because I was made
for this sewer,

11:13.150 --> 11:15.240
baby, and I am the king!

11:17.370 --> 11:20.350
He's taunting the champ
mercilessly.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.490
I haven't seen
this kind of disrespect...

11:22.590 --> 11:24.630
shown to a heavyweight
champion in the ring since...

11:24.670 --> 11:27.630
Would you stop playing and fight!

11:27.800 --> 11:29.780
- Buster Douglas.
- Buster Douglas, exactly.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.870
The condition he's in,
sooner or later...

11:31.970 --> 11:33.930
Look at Ruiz dance around!
The crowd is loving it!

11:33.940 --> 11:35.000
She's not watching the fight.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.080
- Or hating it.
- Or hating it. Exactly.

11:37.180 --> 11:38.320
What they came to see...

11:38.420 --> 11:41.250
tonight was a professional
heavyweight championship fight,

11:41.350 --> 11:43.340
and that is not
what they're getting,

11:43.440 --> 11:44.670
and you better believe
they are letting...

11:44.770 --> 11:45.420
these fighters know it.

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
You know,

11:46.620 --> 11:49.880
I seriously wonder
just how seriously...

11:49.980 --> 11:52.720
the champ is taking this fight.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.840
The champ has shown
up here tonight...

11:54.940 --> 11:56.890
in the worst
condition of his career.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.980
Yeah, I've got to agree with you.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.110
There was a lot of speculation
about the condition he was in.

12:02.210 --> 12:06.210
Hello? Hey, baby,
kind of a bad time right now.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.360
What? All right.
Guess quick, okay?

12:08.460 --> 12:11.490
All right. The hint was, you really
want it and it'll keep you warm.

12:11.590 --> 12:12.671
No, Monique, it's not that.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.620
I mean, I had that. It goes
where I go. You know what I..

12:14.720 --> 12:17.750
Hang on. Wha... Oh, Jesus, Angela!
The fight's starting.

12:17.850 --> 12:20.910
What? The deluxe
has meatballs, baby!

12:20.980 --> 12:22.960
All right, I gotta go.
The fight's starting.

12:23.060 --> 12:26.090
Listen, I gotta go.
The fight's starting.

12:26.190 --> 12:29.220
Hey, I dig affection, baby,
but not while I'm driving.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.280
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That seat's taken.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.430
But you can sit here.

12:34.530 --> 12:38.910
- Well, I'll just need one minute.
- Me too.

12:40.790 --> 12:43.820
- It's in the pocket.
- Have you been writing to me?

12:43.920 --> 12:46.880
Yeah, go Sea Devils!

12:47.040 --> 12:48.040
Holy cow!

12:48.140 --> 12:50.070
The challenger is
down! Ruiz is down!

12:50.170 --> 12:51.120
What a punch by Lincoln Tyler!

12:51.220 --> 12:53.200
Ruiz was pushing it! He was..

12:53.300 --> 12:54.300
He head-butted!

12:54.400 --> 12:56.330
He head-butted!
It's a head-butt!

12:56.430 --> 12:57.610
Here comes the pain, baby!

12:57.710 --> 12:59.460
He must not...
Didn't he see that?

12:59.560 --> 13:00.560
Here comes the pain!

13:00.660 --> 13:02.590
This is a potentially
devastating blow to the champ.

13:02.690 --> 13:04.670
I can't see if it's opened up
a cut over his eye or not.

13:04.770 --> 13:06.760
We saw it in the
Holyfield-Tyson match,

13:06.860 --> 13:07.800
and we see it here.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.260
You're a bum, Lincoln Tyler!
How can you...

13:10.360 --> 13:10.930
He's down!

13:11.030 --> 13:12.980
Listen to me, Mr Secretary.

13:13.080 --> 13:17.180
I am telling you, you are the
one that's gonna be sorry.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.270
Get back! Neutral corner.

13:19.370 --> 13:23.120
Hello. What?
Who are you? Where?

13:23.540 --> 13:26.580
My lucky number?

13:27.710 --> 13:30.170
What?

13:51.690 --> 13:54.740
Principal is down.

13:55.860 --> 13:58.160
Hey!

14:35.490 --> 14:39.700
Kevin! Kevin, he's down!
The man is down!

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Get outta here!

14:50.080 --> 14:52.120
Oh, yeah? Screw you, man!

14:52.170 --> 14:55.970
Tommy, get this scum out of here!

15:01.550 --> 15:02.550
Oh, Jesus.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.580
There were two hits.
The girl next to me,

15:04.680 --> 15:07.780
she threatened him,
took something,

15:07.880 --> 15:09.880
got shot and ran away.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.920
- Oh, my God!
- Shut down the arena.

15:13.020 --> 15:14.470
Shit. Is he dead?

15:14.570 --> 15:18.820
Get on your goddam radio
and shut down the arena!

15:26.580 --> 15:29.540
- Hey, be careful!
- Let go of me!

15:29.710 --> 15:31.690
- What happened to you?
- Would you please ju...

15:31.790 --> 15:33.780
- What's going on? Come back here!
- Let go of me!

15:33.880 --> 15:35.860
Let's get this gurney up!
Let's go!

15:35.960 --> 15:37.570
Come on, make a
hole through there!

15:37.670 --> 15:38.990
Get that crowd outta the way!

15:39.090 --> 15:40.090
Come on! Tell him to bring...

15:40.190 --> 15:42.120
that ambulance through the main
entrance into the arena tunnel!

15:42.220 --> 15:43.880
You're gonna be all right.

15:43.980 --> 15:46.290
You are gonna be
all right, Charles.

15:46.390 --> 15:47.400
You're going to the hospital...

15:47.500 --> 15:49.420
right now. You're gonna be
okay. You have my word on that.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.070
Come on, come on!
Get those people...

15:51.170 --> 15:52.610
outta the tunnel! Move it, there!

15:52.650 --> 15:55.680
He's gonna die, Rick.
This is my fault.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.800
I should never have left my seat.
I opened up a sight line.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.930
I was off the deck. What the hell
was I doing? This is my fault!

16:02.030 --> 16:03.370
What the hell is the matter...

16:03.470 --> 16:06.100
with you? Don't talk shit
like that where people can hear.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.200
You don't understand.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.270
I pulled rank on regular detail
and took command of security.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.680
I told them the secretary...

16:11.780 --> 16:14.440
would be better protected
with me running the operation,

16:14.540 --> 16:16.550
because I know the
area, the layout of...

16:16.650 --> 16:18.610
the arena and the
local law enforcement.

16:18.710 --> 16:19.860
I get assigned, I step...

16:19.960 --> 16:22.790
out of position, the secretary
takes a bullet in the throat.

16:22.890 --> 16:23.890
Why were you out of position?

16:23.990 --> 16:25.910
I should never have left him.
I could be court-martialled!

16:26.010 --> 16:27.300
That is not gonna happen!

16:27.400 --> 16:30.080
We're not gonna let that
happen. Do you understand?

16:30.180 --> 16:32.170
You are not going to prison,
so you just forget about that!

16:32.270 --> 16:35.300
All right, back up.
Why were you out of position?

16:35.400 --> 16:39.470
The girl... the redhead...
I went over to check her out.

16:39.570 --> 16:41.550
She ran, and
I followed her up here.

16:41.650 --> 16:44.680
Don't say 'redhead' and don't say
'girl'. Say 'suspicious character'.

16:44.780 --> 16:45.900
You followed a
suspicious character,

16:46.000 --> 16:46.770
and when you got up here,

16:46.870 --> 16:48.850
you saw an assassin fire,
so you took him out, end of story.

16:48.950 --> 16:51.980
Rick, leaving my post is dereliction
of duty. It's gross negligence.

16:52.080 --> 16:55.110
You killed the assassin!
You saved the day!

16:55.210 --> 16:56.650
You're a hero, Kevin. That's what...

16:56.710 --> 16:58.240
happened, and that's
how we'll spin it.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.370
- It wasn't procedure.
- Screw procedure!

17:01.470 --> 17:03.450
Look, who do you think
you're talking to?

17:03.550 --> 17:07.619
I'm not some beat cop that needs
you to plant a piece for him.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.750
Kevin, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to cover my ass.

17:10.849 --> 17:12.839
I see this shit happen every day.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.970
What you say and do
right this minute...

17:15.069 --> 17:17.010
is gonna change
the rest of your life.

17:17.109 --> 17:21.900
Go to confession later,
but don't bury yourself now!

17:22.319 --> 17:25.910
Clear it out! Comin' through.

17:27.530 --> 17:30.560
Those are state cops.
They're gaming enforcement.

17:30.660 --> 17:31.550
They're gonna try and muscle us,

17:31.650 --> 17:32.650
but we're not gonna
let that happen.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.290
If we're first contact
when the feds get...

17:34.390 --> 17:35.780
here, everybody
writes from our report,

17:35.880 --> 17:38.900
and your story holds up
because we say so.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.990
We just gotta keep
all the media outta here till then.

17:41.090 --> 17:43.070
How long will it take
the feds to get here?

17:43.170 --> 17:46.200
No comment.
This is an active investigation.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.250
FBI's gotta come from Trenton,
so that's an hour,

17:47.350 --> 17:50.370
maybe an hour and a half
with the storm.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.470
So we just gotta fight these...

17:51.570 --> 17:53.500
guys for an hour and a half,
and you're in the clear, okay?

17:53.600 --> 17:56.580
- I can't lie, Rick.
- It isn't lying!

17:56.730 --> 17:59.030
You just tell 'em
what you did right,

17:59.130 --> 18:00.800
and you leave out the rest!

18:00.900 --> 18:02.890
Shouldn't even be here.
This is a crime scene.

18:02.990 --> 18:07.160
Or you can throw away
your whole career.

18:13.410 --> 18:14.410
Gordon Pritzker,

18:14.510 --> 18:16.440
Division of Gaming Enforcement.
What the hell is going on here?

18:16.540 --> 18:18.530
187 with
an officer-involved shooting.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.610
Secretary Kirkland
was shot in the neck.

18:20.710 --> 18:22.700
Paramedics just wheeled him out,
and that's the perpetrator.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.800
Security detail leader
took him out during the shooting.

18:29.050 --> 18:30.050
That's right.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.080
Commander Kevin Dunne.
I'm with D.O.D.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.170
- Who are you?
- Atlantic City, Major Crimes.

18:34.270 --> 18:36.250
- I'll take it now.
- No, bullshit you will.

18:36.350 --> 18:37.360
This isn't my blood, all right?

18:37.460 --> 18:39.380
It's the secretary's. I was
sitting right in front of him.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.561
I'm a homicide detective...

18:40.580 --> 18:42.510
and a material witness. This
is mine about six different ways!

18:42.610 --> 18:44.590
A.C. cops got no
business in the casino.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.720
This is strictly D.G.E.
and state police.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.020
We're not on the casino floor,

18:49.050 --> 18:50.891
Gordo! And this arena
ain't the Millennium yet!

18:50.950 --> 18:53.980
It's Atlantic City, New Jersey,
and that belongs to me!

18:54.080 --> 18:57.110
I'm acting case agent until relieved
by appropriate federal authority!

18:57.210 --> 18:58.210
Now, you want to help,

18:58.310 --> 19:01.280
you go tell your men to get all
the media outta here right now!

19:01.380 --> 19:02.670
Unless you want the 9:00 news...

19:02.770 --> 19:04.450
to give the secretary's
wife and kids...

19:04.510 --> 19:06.490
a close-up look
at his internal organs.

19:06.590 --> 19:09.620
Phil, Jim, make this whole
arena a crime scene. Shut it down.

19:09.720 --> 19:10.960
Nobody goes in or out till...

19:11.060 --> 19:12.750
the main investigating
party gets here.

19:12.850 --> 19:14.830
You're the one who told them
to seal the doors?

19:14.930 --> 19:19.000
You can't hold 14,000 people
in these goddam exit tunnels!

19:19.100 --> 19:21.090
Yes, we did, and yes, we can.

19:21.190 --> 19:23.170
Those are 14,000 eyewitnesses!

19:23.270 --> 19:23.770
Excuse me...

19:23.790 --> 19:25.310
We can just take as
long as it takes...

19:25.360 --> 19:28.390
to get 14,000 addresses
and 14,000 phone numbers...

19:28.490 --> 19:33.280
and take 14,000 pictures,
now that I think about it.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.660
Let's get the hell outta here.

19:36.830 --> 19:38.830
You're home free, baby.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.900
All right.
The woman who ran away...

19:41.000 --> 19:44.030
You said, she...
she took something. What was it?

19:44.130 --> 19:45.350
It was in a manila
envelope about this big.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.110
What did she look like?

19:46.210 --> 19:47.300
Caucasian, late 20's,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.240
dressed in white,
blood everywhere.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.330
She had a blonde wig,
dark hair underneath.

19:51.430 --> 19:54.460
All right. You stay here with
every uniform you can get.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.390
I'll run a top-to-bottom
and find her.

19:56.490 --> 19:57.580
You guys, come with me.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.710
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Commander Dunne, sir?

20:00.810 --> 20:03.840
Could you give us the identity
of the assassin, please?

20:03.940 --> 20:05.930
- Sir, how does it feel to be a hero?
- Hey, you, get outta here.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.790
We told you never to
talk to the people...

20:07.890 --> 20:09.130
here. No press in the arena.

20:09.150 --> 20:11.920
I said no press inside
the arena, Lou.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.220
Not in the arena!

20:13.320 --> 20:15.310
Hey, I could see why you want
these other assholes outta here,

20:15.410 --> 20:17.400
but I didn't think
you were talking about me too!

20:17.500 --> 20:18.800
You know what kind
of break this is for me?

20:18.900 --> 20:19.480
You can't show this.

20:19.580 --> 20:20.570
Look at the mess on the floor.

20:20.670 --> 20:22.610
The guy's got a family. Have
a heart, for Christ's sakes.

20:22.710 --> 20:25.740
All right. I won't shoot
the spaghetti, then.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.820
Come on. Whenever
they make statements,

20:27.920 --> 20:29.910
they always have one pool reporter
asking all the questions.

20:30.010 --> 20:34.080
That's the way they do it.
Come on. Let me be the guy.

20:34.180 --> 20:36.381
Have you got the playback
for the pay-per-view up there?

20:36.470 --> 20:37.271
Yeah, right up here.

20:37.310 --> 20:39.290
Look, you don't know what
this would mean to me, Rick.

20:39.390 --> 20:40.390
You think I want to do...

20:40.490 --> 20:42.420
this, this pay-per-view
shit for the rest of my life?

20:42.520 --> 20:44.510
Do you know how Rather
got his break?

20:44.610 --> 20:46.830
The goddam Kennedy
assassination!

20:46.930 --> 20:48.680
You make me sick, Lou.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.060
Hey, if you're gonna be on TV,

20:50.160 --> 20:51.800
who better asking
you the questions...

20:51.900 --> 20:53.890
than your old pal Lou?

20:53.990 --> 20:57.020
Plus, I can have two grand cash
in an hour and a half.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.100
You are a disgusting human being.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.190
Hey, five grand in an hour.

21:01.290 --> 21:03.030
Congratulations,
Lou. You're the guy!

21:03.130 --> 21:03.270
Yes!

21:03.370 --> 21:06.400
Hook up out in the hallway. I don't
want to see one TV camera inside.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.490
- Right.
- This whole arena's a crime scene.

21:08.590 --> 21:11.620
Hey, Rick, I gotta tell you, I will
always be there for you, my friend.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.740
Oh, yeah. See if you can find me
another shirt if I'm going on TV.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.830
I don't wanna look like this.

21:16.930 --> 21:19.540
Gotta be, you know,
classy like you, Lou.

21:19.640 --> 21:19.960
Yeah.

21:20.060 --> 21:24.060
And... Yeah.
Here's your hundred back.

21:24.230 --> 21:27.190
All bets are off.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.580
Secretary of defense
gets his head blown off,

21:59.680 --> 22:02.710
and you want to look
at the knockout punch.

22:02.810 --> 22:06.270
Back up.

22:06.980 --> 22:09.320
Stop.

22:10.110 --> 22:12.090
How many cameras
do you have on it?

22:12.190 --> 22:16.700
- I got four.
- All right. Let me see 'em all.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.960
I'll be damned.

22:33.050 --> 22:37.390
Air ball. What kind
of a Sea Devil is that?

23:01.200 --> 23:05.370
Oh, God. What did you
get yourself into?

23:07.460 --> 23:10.490
Look here. Mr Tyler, he ain't
in the mood to talk to nobody.

23:10.590 --> 23:14.960
You see where your hand is?
That's a felony.

23:35.610 --> 23:39.280
Give me a 'C'! Give me an 'H'!

23:39.780 --> 23:42.810
Give me an 'A-M-P'!
What's that spell?

23:42.910 --> 23:44.910
Everybody! Champ.

23:44.990 --> 23:48.020
Lincoln, how ya doin'?
Good to see you again.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.110
- What, am I supposed to know you?
- Rick Santoro.

23:50.210 --> 23:53.240
Neptune High.
Fellow Sea Devil. Class of '80.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.020
I don't remember you.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.320
Come on. You must
have seen me play.

23:55.420 --> 23:58.450
My hair was long then,
but whose wasn't, right?

23:58.550 --> 24:01.580
- Mr Santoro.
- Detective. Detective Santoro.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.660
Now, I know it might be
a bad time,

24:03.760 --> 24:05.800
but could I get you to sign
an autograph for my son?

24:05.850 --> 24:07.830
He thinks you're the greatest,
just the greatest.

24:07.930 --> 24:09.930
'To Mikey'.

24:10.020 --> 24:11.760
I bet if you saw my
graduation picture,

24:11.860 --> 24:13.050
the face would ring a bell.

24:13.150 --> 24:16.730
Look, I don't know you, okay?

24:17.320 --> 24:18.620
Lincoln, you hurt my feelings,

24:18.720 --> 24:20.350
and after I dropped
ten grand on you.

24:20.450 --> 24:22.490
You know what? I think it
would show more respect...

24:22.530 --> 24:25.560
if you address my client
as Mr Tyler.

24:25.660 --> 24:29.730
I'll call him Mr 'T'! The night
he beat Rocky Balboa, if he wants.

24:29.830 --> 24:32.860
He's a bad pony.
I don't have to tell you, right?

24:32.960 --> 24:37.800
Yeah. Yeah, I saw Jimmy George.
You know, the bookie.

24:38.170 --> 24:40.160
He was coming out of here
before the fight.

24:40.260 --> 24:41.840
How much did you lose?

24:41.940 --> 24:44.330
Or did you win?
Know what I mean?

24:44.430 --> 24:46.410
- Wasn't his night...
- I'll say.

24:46.510 --> 24:48.310
Hey, look. The guy
was a great fighter.

24:48.410 --> 24:49.540
He fought very furiously.

24:49.640 --> 24:53.710
You know, you've never been
knocked out your whole career.

24:53.810 --> 24:56.840
I mean, ever! Since your first
Golden Gloves in what, '82?

24:56.940 --> 24:58.930
I'd know.
I've seen all your fights.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.280
What with us both being...

25:00.380 --> 25:03.100
from the same school and
both being Sea Devils and all.

25:03.200 --> 25:03.990
The man head-butted me, and

25:04.090 --> 25:05.180
I don't remember
anything after that.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.930
Excuse me, Lincoln.
Would you drink...

25:07.030 --> 25:08.351
a glass of water or something?

25:08.410 --> 25:09.830
You're lying so much, your mouth...

25:09.930 --> 25:12.490
dried up, and you're making
that funny... that smacking sound.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.570
Let me remind you
who you're talking to, hot shot.

25:14.670 --> 25:17.700
Lincoln Tyler
is a significant public figure.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.780
He's a goddam pillar
of this community.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.050
Let's keep that in mind,

25:21.150 --> 25:23.950
or this little interview that
we're having here is over.

25:24.050 --> 25:25.490
Look, the guy... the secretary...
he's dead, isn't he?

25:25.590 --> 25:26.040
Lincoln, Lincoln.

25:26.140 --> 25:28.380
If you have a question,
let me ask it for you.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.170
Look, Mickey!

25:29.270 --> 25:33.390
I just want to know
if the guy is dead.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.480
Is he dead?

25:36.560 --> 25:40.360
The smart money ain't on him.

25:41.780 --> 25:44.740
That's it. That is it.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.670
Do you know who
you reminded me...

25:47.770 --> 25:50.020
of out there? Sonny Liston!

25:50.120 --> 25:51.370
Remember in '65, they said,

25:51.470 --> 25:53.150
'Hey, Sonny, don't
take any chances.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.230
'Ali almost killed you
the first time.

25:55.330 --> 25:57.320
Take the payday.
First punch, you go down'.

25:57.420 --> 25:59.420
Flop. Splat. That's you!

25:59.500 --> 26:00.500
That's you!

26:00.600 --> 26:02.530
Detective, either
arrest him or leave.

26:02.630 --> 26:05.660
What would I arrest him for?
What would I arrest you for?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.750
- Getting up too quick?
- What?

26:07.850 --> 26:10.870
What? Come on.
I saw you, and you saw me.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.960
Don't pretend like you don't
know who I am, girlie man.

26:13.060 --> 26:15.040
You wanted it
to look like a knockout,

26:15.140 --> 26:16.500
but when you heard the gunshots,

26:16.600 --> 26:18.170
your eyes were open
in half a second.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.450
Totally understandable reaction,

26:19.550 --> 26:21.391
but it ruined the
performance, don't you think?

26:21.400 --> 26:23.390
What the hell do you want?
The man knocked me out!

26:23.490 --> 26:26.510
I looked at the fight tape,
Lincoln! Yeah!

26:26.610 --> 26:29.640
It was a phantom punch!
A little bad Hollywood acting,

26:29.740 --> 26:31.730
but the athletic commission
might find it interesting.

26:31.830 --> 26:34.860
And a second after you go down,
an assassin fires.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.290
Well, that's some coincidence!

26:36.390 --> 26:39.030
I guess they don't call you
the 'Executioner' for nothing!

26:39.130 --> 26:42.090
And you sign my kid's autograph!

26:42.260 --> 26:44.240
All right, that's it.
Everybody get out.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.330
- Listen to me. This guy's a snake.
- Mickey!

26:46.430 --> 26:48.850
What don't you
understand about this?

26:48.950 --> 26:50.500
Get the hell outta here!

26:50.600 --> 26:53.470
Go on, get out!

26:59.980 --> 27:02.530
His name?

27:03.110 --> 27:06.030
Michael Santoro.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.240
This is a crime scene.

27:10.410 --> 27:12.480
In order to exit the arena,

27:12.580 --> 27:15.520
we must see an
authentic picture I. D.

27:15.620 --> 27:18.650
If you cannot produce one,
you must step to the left...

27:18.750 --> 27:20.740
where the officer
will take your photograph...

27:20.840 --> 27:22.820
and record your name
and address.

27:22.920 --> 27:27.930
I'll say this one more time.
No one, with no exceptions,

27:28.130 --> 27:30.060
will be allowed to exit the arena...

27:30.160 --> 27:32.210
until your identity
has been recorded.

27:32.310 --> 27:37.060
Everyone's cooperation
will be greatly appreciated.

27:43.780 --> 27:46.690
Watch your step.

27:50.030 --> 27:54.990
Hey, hey, hey! I said
no press in the arena, goddam it!

27:56.290 --> 28:00.080
Move to the right.
Clear the way.

28:11.930 --> 28:14.890
That punk fights like a bitch.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.280
He got no snap in his
punches. He swings...

28:17.380 --> 28:19.130
with his arm, no
shoulder muscles.

28:19.230 --> 28:22.360
You threw the fight.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.510
If I say yes, can we
cut some kind of deal?

28:28.610 --> 28:30.050
You don't need a deal.

28:30.150 --> 28:32.680
I'm not gonna say
anything to anybody.

28:32.780 --> 28:34.770
You pay me back
the ten grand I lost,

28:34.870 --> 28:37.900
plus $500 for shaming the ring,
and I forgive you.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
What'd you do it for?

28:40.080 --> 28:43.110
You can't need the money.
You gotta be worth millions.

28:43.210 --> 28:45.880
They didn't tell me
they were gonna kill somebody.

28:45.980 --> 28:46.240
Who?

28:46.340 --> 28:49.470
Who didn't tell you?

28:51.550 --> 28:55.560
Look, man. See,
you just don't understand.

28:55.720 --> 29:00.690
I just gave away the one thing
I know that makes me me.

29:01.980 --> 29:05.570
The heavyweight championship.

29:07.190 --> 29:09.180
Now that I don't even have that,

29:09.280 --> 29:12.250
I don't even know
who I am any more.

29:12.410 --> 29:15.370
What did they have on you?

29:15.530 --> 29:18.560
- Get 'em outta here, Cyrus.
- Yo! Pay-per-view?

29:18.660 --> 29:21.690
Oh, man, great shot, buddy. Yeah,
great shot. Great shot. Terrific.

29:21.790 --> 29:24.750
Come on, take a hike, okay?

29:24.920 --> 29:25.380
This is so good.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.900
There's cameras everywhere,
for Christ's sake.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
What about if the guy from...

29:28.100 --> 29:30.030
the commission comes in here,
he wants to check your gloves.

29:30.130 --> 29:33.160
What are you gonna do, retire
and live on your savings?

29:33.260 --> 29:34.700
What savings? You gotta have this...

29:34.780 --> 29:36.381
freak show here
tonight of all nights.

29:36.390 --> 29:38.290
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.
Come here, Mickey!

29:38.390 --> 29:39.420
Forget about it, Cyrus.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.540
- Come on!
- I did not go to law school for this.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.630
- Mickey, I can't...
- What? Keep your shirt on, Cyrus.

29:44.730 --> 29:47.760
Come on, Mickey.
I'm trying to do this here.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.820
- Four, right?
- No, no, no, no.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.990
- Four, Mickey!
- I said three. The deal was three.

29:53.070 --> 29:55.070
- Four!
- Hey, Mick.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.140
- What do you want?
- Just a second. Give me 35.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.270
- I got a quick question.
- Take a hike.

30:00.370 --> 30:01.370
Come on, man!

30:01.470 --> 30:03.400
I'm gonna get you
later. Get outta here.

30:03.500 --> 30:07.570
I'm gettin' a lot of bets... very large
bets against Lincoln, that is.

30:07.670 --> 30:09.650
I'm just wondering
what the fuck is going on.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.540
Would you please
lower your voice?

30:11.640 --> 30:12.780
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.910
It's just everybody knows
Lincoln likes the action, right?

30:16.010 --> 30:17.050
I mean, what I'm saying is

30:17.110 --> 30:19.040
Lincoln likes to gamble, right?
It's not exactly a secret.

30:19.140 --> 30:22.170
Never on boxing. I've been through
all this shit with the commission.

30:22.270 --> 30:24.250
- I do not have to explain it to you.
- I know about the commission.

30:24.350 --> 30:25.350
Never on boxing.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.380
You're right. Yeah,
that's right, okay?

30:27.480 --> 30:29.470
He's in pretty heavy at some
of the casinos, isn't he?

30:29.570 --> 30:30.740
And some people are saying that...

30:30.840 --> 30:32.590
maybe he's looking to
clean up the books a little.

30:32.690 --> 30:34.680
Maybe Lincoln's decided
tonight's not his night.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.510
You actually come to
tell him there's...

30:36.610 --> 30:37.850
a lot of action against him?

30:37.910 --> 30:39.800
Then you have the nerve
to accuse him of what?

30:39.900 --> 30:40.940
You know what I'm saying.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.020
I've never been this
offended in my life.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.640
I want you to tell Lincoln what you...

30:44.670 --> 30:46.190
just said to me.
Come on. Hey, Lincoln?

30:46.250 --> 30:47.520
Jimmy's got something really...

30:47.620 --> 30:49.300
interesting to tell
you. Listen to this.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.580
Go on, tell him.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.450
Forget it. Forget everything I said.

30:53.550 --> 30:55.530
- Come on. Listen.
- Knock him dead, champ.

30:55.630 --> 30:57.620
Jimmy George, wait up a second.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.990
Hey, come on, Rick.
I got people waiting for me.

31:00.090 --> 31:00.750
Hey. Hey. Hey!

31:00.850 --> 31:01.850
That's Tyler!

31:01.950 --> 31:04.920
Hey, what are you looking
at? Go buy a ticket.

31:05.020 --> 31:08.050
You are never
gonna get away with this.

31:08.150 --> 31:10.130
- Get out of my face, Mickey.
- Look at me!

31:10.230 --> 31:12.220
- No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Look at yourself!

31:12.320 --> 31:15.350
Bleed, Mickey! Bleed!
You taught me that.

31:15.450 --> 31:17.450
Remember?

31:17.530 --> 31:20.560
No, no. No way, man.
You got yourself into this.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.640
You get caught,
you lose my phone number.

31:22.740 --> 31:24.730
I told you,
you can't live like you do.

31:24.830 --> 31:27.860
You make yourself vulnerable.
Everybody wants a piece of you.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.800
- Well, look at this, man.
- They got all of you now.

31:33.170 --> 31:36.200
That's beautiful. That is...
That's terrif... That's great.

31:36.300 --> 31:39.360
- That's great. Jesus Christ!
- Mickey?

31:39.430 --> 31:40.430
Yeah? Cyrus, here.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.460
Come on, Mickey. I got bills to pay.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.580
- Take that and get lost.
- Best of the best, right, Mr Tyler?

31:45.680 --> 31:48.250
Come on, get outta
here. Move along.

31:48.350 --> 31:49.750
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

31:49.850 --> 31:51.850
Tyler!

31:51.940 --> 31:53.940
Tyler! Ty...

31:54.030 --> 31:55.930
Words mean something
to somebody else...

31:56.030 --> 31:57.050
All right, don't move.

31:57.150 --> 32:01.160
- I'll be right back. Cyrus! Cyrus!
- Yo, yo.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.160
- Cyrus!
- Yo!

32:04.450 --> 32:08.580
How much were you
into the casinos for?

32:09.670 --> 32:11.670
Enough.

32:11.750 --> 32:13.740
The people that set this up
said if I dropped this one,

32:13.840 --> 32:16.800
they'd square everything I owed.

32:16.970 --> 32:21.040
Plus, if I lose to an underdog,
it would set me up for a rematch,

32:21.140 --> 32:23.120
and the rematch
is where the real money is.

32:23.220 --> 32:26.250
They didn't say what round
they wanted it in.

32:26.350 --> 32:27.830
They were gonna let
me know during the...

32:27.930 --> 32:29.380
fight. There was a
guy in the front row.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.560
They told me what he
was gonna say, and...

32:31.660 --> 32:33.550
he was gonna be
the signal to go down.

32:33.650 --> 32:36.680
I ain't never
gonna forget those words:

32:36.780 --> 32:40.030
'Here comes the pain'.

32:41.990 --> 32:45.020
It was all I could do to keep from
taking him out. Just one punch.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.150
Shove that radio right through
the side of his head.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.250
- Radio?
- Yeah.

32:50.330 --> 32:53.360
He had one of those things
in his ear.

32:53.460 --> 32:56.420
Anyway, the fight started.

32:56.590 --> 32:58.570
Come on, man. Come on, old man.

32:58.670 --> 33:00.660
Let's see what you got, old man.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.800
I couldn't get that sack of shit
to take a decent swing at me.

33:03.900 --> 33:04.830
Is that all you got?

33:04.930 --> 33:07.960
He wouldn't stop talking, like he
was gonna bullshit me to death.

33:08.060 --> 33:11.090
Gotta do better than that.
Come on, baby!

33:11.190 --> 33:12.190
Come on, now!

33:12.290 --> 33:14.210
You're too slow,
old man. Come on!

33:14.310 --> 33:17.900
What you gonna do to me?

33:20.570 --> 33:23.530
That's what I'm talking about.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.790
Yeah!

33:27.870 --> 33:30.900
Come on, baby! Come on!
Come on! Let's see what you got!

33:31.000 --> 33:34.030
Let me see what you got, old man.
Come on, bring it to me.

33:34.130 --> 33:37.420
Come on! Come on! Yeah!

33:48.720 --> 33:50.710
Yeah, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

33:50.810 --> 33:52.590
What are you trying to do...

33:52.690 --> 33:55.920
with that stuff you got?
Come on. You're too slow!

33:56.020 --> 33:58.010
I was just trying to shut him up.

33:58.110 --> 34:01.070
I barely even tapped him,

34:01.240 --> 34:03.220
and I almost won the fight.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.320
Go, Sea Devils!

34:05.410 --> 34:08.080
One, two...

34:09.580 --> 34:12.409
three, four...

34:15.830 --> 34:18.290
five...

34:18.960 --> 34:21.380
six...

34:22.090 --> 34:24.590
seven...

34:26.260 --> 34:28.760
eight...

34:33.560 --> 34:37.150
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:38.770 --> 34:41.400
Get it on!

34:42.940 --> 34:47.489
You punch like a bitch!
This is a fight! Get...

34:48.159 --> 34:51.190
And he did head-butt me.
I wasn't lying about that.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.310
Everything went wrong. It was like
he was trying to screw up the deal.

34:54.409 --> 34:56.400
- I'll stop the fight.
- No!

34:56.500 --> 34:59.530
- Right after that, I got the signal.
- Are you all right?

34:59.630 --> 35:01.610
- Are you sure?
- It was quicker than I thought.

35:01.710 --> 35:04.740
- Maybe they were getting nervous.
- Let's get it on.

35:04.840 --> 35:08.850
Here comes the pain, baby!
Here comes the pain!

35:09.010 --> 35:13.080
- Here comes the pain!
- I showed you what it's about!

35:13.180 --> 35:14.820
I wasn't supposed to
go down right away.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.210
They were very clear about that.

35:16.310 --> 35:17.630
I had to take a punch, fall...

35:17.730 --> 35:20.380
back into the corner, let him
charge in and knock me out...

35:20.480 --> 35:22.470
because they wanted everybody
up on their feet, distracted,

35:22.570 --> 35:25.600
giving him a clear shot
right through the count.

35:25.700 --> 35:29.770
But that punkass son of a bitch
didn't sweep through the punch,

35:29.870 --> 35:32.890
and I was so far into the act
in my own head, you know,

35:32.990 --> 35:35.800
by the time I realized he didn't...

35:35.900 --> 35:39.150
connect, I was
already in the corner.

35:39.250 --> 35:41.250
You're a bum, Tyler!

35:41.340 --> 35:45.340
How could you do this to me?
He's a bum!

35:45.510 --> 35:47.490
Get back! Neutral corners.

35:47.590 --> 35:50.760
Get back! Stay there!

35:51.760 --> 35:54.520
One... two...

35:54.890 --> 35:57.770
three... four..

36:06.360 --> 36:09.320
But nobody was supposed to die.

36:09.490 --> 36:12.390
She never said
anything about that.

36:12.490 --> 36:13.560
She? She?

36:13.660 --> 36:16.620
You hear that storm out there?

36:16.790 --> 36:18.730
I wish it would blow
this whole town away.

36:18.830 --> 36:19.820
No, no, no. Who's she?

36:19.920 --> 36:20.970
She's the one who came to me...

36:21.070 --> 36:22.940
in the first place, told
me I was supposed to go down.

36:23.040 --> 36:26.070
- I never met anybody else but her.
- Did you get a name?

36:26.170 --> 36:27.490
Yeah, name, address, serial...

36:27.590 --> 36:30.240
number, 8 by 10 colour picture.
You wanna look at that too?

36:30.340 --> 36:33.370
Do you remember anything
unusual about her?

36:33.470 --> 36:35.460
- Her hair, maybe.
- What about it?

36:35.560 --> 36:39.560
It was bright red,
like it was on fire.

36:39.730 --> 36:43.800
A Palestinian who's lived in the
United States for the last six years.

36:43.900 --> 36:47.970
He's believed to be linked
to a series of threatening letters...

36:48.070 --> 36:50.070
written to various
defense secretaries...

36:50.170 --> 36:51.130
expressing outrage...

36:51.200 --> 36:54.230
over the sale of missile systems
and other weaponry to lsrael.

36:54.330 --> 36:58.330
A handwritten note
was found on Rabat's body.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.480
Would you hold that
up too, please?

37:00.580 --> 37:03.610
Apparently he intended it
to be found after the shooting.

37:03.710 --> 37:05.700
Commander, what's
in the note, sir?

37:05.800 --> 37:07.780
I can't disclose that until
it's been studied by investigators.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.950
Commander, could you give us the
condition of the secretary, please?

37:12.050 --> 37:15.080
He was taken
to Atlantic City Medical Center,

37:15.180 --> 37:17.170
but, I have no other
information at this time.

37:17.270 --> 37:20.290
That's all I can say until the F.B.I.
joins the investigation.

37:20.390 --> 37:21.990
Thank you, Commander.

37:22.090 --> 37:24.460
That was Commander Kevin Dunne.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.560
Did you find her?

37:25.660 --> 37:27.590
No. She might have
gone into the casino.

37:27.690 --> 37:29.190
There's a dozen service
doors from here...

37:29.290 --> 37:30.720
to there. We couldn't
watch all of them.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.990
Well, double the men you
have at the casino exits.

37:33.090 --> 37:33.891
I gotta talk to you.

37:33.950 --> 37:36.980
- What is it?
- Let's go somewhere private.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.860
Just because a guy has
something plugged...

37:38.960 --> 37:40.200
into his ear doesn't mean...

37:40.210 --> 37:42.190
I asked.
Tyler says it was a radio.

37:42.290 --> 37:43.880
Okay, we'll check it out.

37:43.980 --> 37:47.400
But a compulsive gambler
who admits he took a dive...

37:47.500 --> 37:49.490
might not turn out
to be the best witness in the world.

37:49.590 --> 37:50.590
It's not just him.

37:50.690 --> 37:51.680
I'm betting the redhead
is the person...

37:51.780 --> 37:52.620
who told Tyler to throw the fight.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.700
She's one, shooter's
two, Tyler's three,

37:54.800 --> 37:56.790
the drunk who shouted
the signal's four,

37:56.890 --> 37:59.920
and whoever was on the other end
of that radio is five.

38:00.020 --> 38:04.020
Five people
make a conspiracy, right?

38:04.190 --> 38:06.020
Yeah, yeah. Look,
anything's possible,

38:06.120 --> 38:07.220
but I gotta tell you...

38:07.320 --> 38:09.300
we got a file an inch thick
on this guy Rabat.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.600
He's a well-known
nutcase. It was clear...

38:11.700 --> 38:13.470
he was ready to
die for his cause.

38:13.570 --> 38:16.530
That's a suicide note.

38:16.700 --> 38:19.730
You know, 'l fly into the arms
of Allah', shit like that.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.810
He was all worked up
about our missile sales to lsrael,

38:21.910 --> 38:24.470
and it's conceivable
that he found out...

38:24.570 --> 38:25.980
about the Norfolk test.

38:26.080 --> 38:29.550
Norfolk test? What's that?

38:30.260 --> 38:32.760
Kevin, I know it's classified,

38:32.860 --> 38:37.190
but I am the investigating
officer in a murder now.

38:38.600 --> 38:42.600
All right. But what are you
chasing this for?

38:42.770 --> 38:46.840
You don't get out of bed unless
there's an angle in it for you.

38:46.940 --> 38:47.970
Guys get elected president...

38:48.070 --> 38:49.970
just for being in the
right place at the right time.

38:50.070 --> 38:53.400
I only want to be mayor.

38:54.240 --> 38:58.240
Look, part of what
I'm going to tell you,

38:58.410 --> 39:01.370
it could bury me.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.560
I hope you can keep this
between us.

39:04.660 --> 39:07.690
Kevin, you're talking
to your best friend.

39:07.790 --> 39:11.959
And loyalty's my only vice.
So what's the problem?

39:11.960 --> 39:16.380
The problem is that
I was in too good a mood.

39:18.220 --> 39:21.250
That trip to Norfolk
was for a weapons test...

39:21.350 --> 39:24.380
for the AirGuard, Powell's
new antimissile defense system.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.500
It's light years ahead of the
Sea Sparrows our ships have now.

39:27.600 --> 39:32.150
If we had this in the Gulf
when the Renville...

39:32.820 --> 39:35.050
After the Renville
incident the old man...

39:35.150 --> 39:36.890
picked me to sell it to congress.

39:36.990 --> 39:38.470
Everybody at D.O.D.
wanted it to work,

39:38.550 --> 39:40.030
and it did. The test
went beautifully.

39:40.120 --> 39:44.190
By the time we got to the fight
tonight, we were all high as kites.

39:44.290 --> 39:48.830
I let the excitement get to me.
I lost my edge.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.530
- Can I see your ticket, please?
- My what?

39:52.630 --> 39:53.630
Your ticket, ma'am.

39:53.730 --> 39:55.660
I need to see your
ticket for this seat.

39:55.760 --> 40:00.640
My ticket. Yeah, sure.
I think I have it here.

40:08.270 --> 40:10.560
Hey!

40:29.120 --> 40:31.110
Hold on a minute.
I was talking to you back there.

40:31.210 --> 40:33.200
Where do you think you're going?

40:33.300 --> 40:36.320
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Is that okay with you?

40:36.420 --> 40:37.741
In the middle of the first round?

40:37.840 --> 40:39.450
You're not much of a
fight fan, I guess.

40:39.550 --> 40:42.580
Look Sarge,
I don't know who you are,

40:42.680 --> 40:44.670
but you have no right
to hassle me like this.

40:44.770 --> 40:45.770
I get paid...

40:45.870 --> 40:48.840
to hassle people. Show me your
ticket, or I'll have you escorted out.

40:48.940 --> 40:53.010
Okay, okay. I don't have a ticket.
I mean, I have a ticket,

40:53.110 --> 40:56.130
but it's way up there
in the nosebleed seats...

40:56.230 --> 40:59.290
and I couldn't see a thing, so...

40:59.360 --> 41:01.200
Listen, I do this all the time.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.430
They always let me
get away with it.

41:03.530 --> 41:06.560
- Come on. It's no big deal.
- It is tonight.

41:06.660 --> 41:10.730
- What's so special about tonight?
- Very important man in the crowd.

41:10.830 --> 41:15.000
And you're,
what, his bodyguard?

41:16.050 --> 41:19.840
That must be a very exciting job.

41:20.220 --> 41:23.800
Yeah, it's got its moments.

41:34.820 --> 41:37.840
I was three feet away
from a known terrorist,

41:37.940 --> 41:42.450
and I had my eyes buried
in some broad's tits.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.790
Well, Kevin, this
might not make you...

41:44.890 --> 41:46.251
feel better, but don't you see?

41:46.280 --> 41:49.310
That's what she was there for.
That was the plan.

41:49.410 --> 41:51.400
To give you a boner.
And you got one.

41:51.500 --> 41:56.130
- Congratulations. You're human.
- Come on, Rick.

41:56.710 --> 41:59.740
Look on the bright side. I like you
better. Golden boy screwed up.

41:59.840 --> 42:03.910
Wait a minute. We need to be very,
very careful with this.

42:04.010 --> 42:06.120
We go out there and
yell conspiracy,

42:06.220 --> 42:08.080
it's like waving a lunatic flag.

42:08.180 --> 42:10.300
We gotta get our hands
on the redhead...

42:10.400 --> 42:12.250
or the guy that
shouted the signal.

42:12.350 --> 42:14.340
If they're still in the building.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.380
And the woman who was
talking to the secretary.

42:15.480 --> 42:18.510
I'll stay after her,
and you find the other two.

42:18.610 --> 42:19.620
No, no. This is wrong.

42:19.720 --> 42:22.680
We're never gonna find anything
just walking around the arena.

42:22.780 --> 42:23.840
What if they've gone
into the casino?

42:23.940 --> 42:24.770
I'm going up to surveillance.

42:24.870 --> 42:26.660
They've got cameras
all over the place.

42:26.760 --> 42:27.890
Just bitchin' technology.

42:27.990 --> 42:28.990
All right,

42:29.090 --> 42:31.770
you do that while I check with...

42:31.870 --> 42:35.270
security, see if
they found anything.

43:13.870 --> 43:15.680
Well, I finally understand...

43:15.780 --> 43:18.990
why you didn't want me to
worry about your shooter.

43:19.090 --> 43:22.050
One less terrorist in the world.

43:22.210 --> 43:25.240
At least he did something
productive on his way out.

43:25.340 --> 43:29.350
Did he know he was
on a suicide mission?

43:29.510 --> 43:32.220
He does now.

43:32.640 --> 43:35.220
With all due respect, sir, we should...

43:35.320 --> 43:37.750
have been out of
here 11 minutes ago.

43:37.850 --> 43:40.980
Things have changed.

43:42.030 --> 43:45.700
We need to make an adjustment.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.160
A local cop made both of you.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.320
- What?
- Made us? How?

43:51.410 --> 43:55.480
It's not important. He's searching
the building for you right now.

43:55.580 --> 43:57.570
So what do we do? Take him out?

43:57.670 --> 44:00.690
- That's not an option.
- It's the only option.

44:00.790 --> 44:03.760
Negative. Not with this guy.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.880
- Let's move out.
- Yes, sir.

44:07.050 --> 44:10.080
You do have a contingency plan,
don't you, sir?

44:10.180 --> 44:13.150
- Yes, but I don't like it.
- Why not?

44:13.310 --> 44:15.290
Because a soldier deserves better.

44:15.390 --> 44:18.150
Jesus Christ!

44:22.690 --> 44:26.700
Wait. I've been shot.
I've been shot.

44:26.860 --> 44:30.200
- I'm shot.
- I'm sorry.

44:39.370 --> 44:42.400
We got 1,500 cameras...
800 on the casino side,

44:42.500 --> 44:45.530
720 on the hotel side, quadruple
redundancy on the gaming floor.

44:45.630 --> 44:47.520
If they're down there,
we'll find them.

44:47.620 --> 44:48.660
I appreciate it, Walt.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.610
No problem. You
think one of these...

44:50.710 --> 44:51.790
people's your shooter?

44:51.890 --> 44:54.920
- We already got the shooter.
- Then, what are you looking for?

44:55.020 --> 44:57.980
- Where do we start?
- You tell me.

44:58.140 --> 45:01.020
- Lobby.
- 118.

45:01.270 --> 45:03.260
- Can you go to the right?
- 154.

45:03.360 --> 45:07.150
Keep moving.
Let's go by section.

45:10.660 --> 45:13.330
Keep going.

45:13.780 --> 45:15.780
No.

45:15.870 --> 45:18.900
Hey, C.J., punch up 383,
the guy in the checkered shirt.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.060
What about him?

45:20.160 --> 45:23.070
Coin cup grabber.
Look. Watch the money.

45:23.170 --> 45:24.170
You know him?

45:24.270 --> 45:26.200
Nah, you just get to
read body language.

45:26.300 --> 45:28.280
There he goes. There he goes.

45:28.380 --> 45:31.410
See, somebody
wants to play the slots,

45:31.510 --> 45:33.290
they're staring at
the machines trying...

45:33.390 --> 45:34.590
to guess which one's lucky.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.620
Grabber could care less.
He checks out the people.

45:36.720 --> 45:40.790
He's like a pickpocket,
only crude, you know? No skills.

45:40.890 --> 45:42.930
- Keep going?
- Keep going.

45:42.980 --> 45:46.980
The identity
of the assassin is Tarik ben Rabat.

45:47.150 --> 45:49.140
Thirty-seven years old.
A Palestinian...

45:49.240 --> 45:51.640
who's lived in the United States
for the last six years.

45:51.740 --> 45:52.260
Oh, my God.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.400
He's believed to be linked
to a series of threatening...

45:54.500 --> 45:55.390
Excuse me. Excuse me.

45:55.490 --> 45:57.490
You down on the race?

45:57.580 --> 46:00.120
Yeah.

46:01.750 --> 46:03.750
Me too.

46:03.830 --> 46:04.830
Yeah.

46:04.930 --> 46:06.860
We got two men covering
every casino exit door.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.960
Nobody's seen her yet.

46:09.050 --> 46:12.080
Keep 'em there. We'll search
the floor section by section.

46:12.180 --> 46:14.180
You are hot.

46:14.260 --> 46:16.430
So, you wanna come
back to my room...

46:16.530 --> 46:18.330
and have a little fun together?

46:18.430 --> 46:21.140
Best idea...

46:21.560 --> 46:25.270
Who's... who's winning?

46:25.730 --> 46:29.740
Looks like the number four
horse, Daddy's Hobby.

46:29.900 --> 46:32.240
Yeah?

46:33.030 --> 46:36.070
God, I'm hot.

46:41.370 --> 46:44.350
Do you have air conditioning?

46:44.500 --> 46:48.580
- In your room, air conditioning.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

46:48.670 --> 46:52.880
- Yeah?
- I keep it turned down real low.

46:58.060 --> 46:59.000
What you want?

46:59.100 --> 47:02.640
I need a word with Mr Tyler.

47:27.250 --> 47:32.380
I want to apologize, sir,
for not securing the infra-reds.

47:33.510 --> 47:38.720
The shooter missed the girl.
There was nothing you could do.

47:48.110 --> 47:50.640
Walter, I think we
got another hooker...

47:50.740 --> 47:52.180
in the Princess Lounge.

47:52.280 --> 47:56.280
- Punch up 596.
- Excuse me a second.

47:57.490 --> 48:00.410
She hasn't been
there five minutes,

48:00.510 --> 48:03.320
she can't take her hands off him.

48:06.870 --> 48:09.900
- Oh, my God, that's her!
- You said she had red hair.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.400
No, somebody else.
Where's that bar?

48:11.430 --> 48:12.070
I don't think...

48:12.090 --> 48:13.130
Walt, they're leaving.

48:13.230 --> 48:15.120
Don't worry, Ricky.
I'll stay with 'em.

48:15.220 --> 48:17.200
Come on, grab a radio,
stay on channel three.

48:17.300 --> 48:20.260
- Here we go. Place your bets.
- Now.

48:20.430 --> 48:24.180
You can't win if you don't play.

48:30.860 --> 48:34.860
- That's her.
- We've located the girl.

48:35.030 --> 48:38.070
- Okay.
- Come on.

48:44.410 --> 48:48.960
- Where is she?
- Over there, by the elevators.

48:49.630 --> 48:53.920
- I got it from here. Thanks.
- Done, sir.

49:16.740 --> 49:21.320
I don't see her, Walt.
Walt, where is she? Walt!

49:21.950 --> 49:23.930
You're on the opposite
side of the floor.

49:24.030 --> 49:25.880
They're playing the
'Magnificent Seven'...

49:25.980 --> 49:27.101
near the lobby elevators.

49:27.160 --> 49:29.670
Got 'em.

49:34.460 --> 49:36.450
Just playing the spare change.

49:36.550 --> 49:38.530
Yeah. I... I wanna go upstairs.

49:38.630 --> 49:41.660
- Yeah, yeah. Me too. Me too.
- Yeah. I wanna go...

49:41.760 --> 49:44.050
Yes!

49:58.440 --> 50:01.410
- Hey!
- I wanna go upstairs now!

50:01.570 --> 50:02.570
Hey.

50:02.670 --> 50:07.690
And if you don't come with me,
I'm sure somebody else will.

50:08.870 --> 50:10.010
Change of plans.

50:10.110 --> 50:12.940
They're at the
elevators. Hang a right.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.880
Wait a minute.

50:22.430 --> 50:24.760
Shit!

50:26.600 --> 50:30.670
- I missed her. Got her on the box?
- Yeah, Ricky, I got 'em.

50:30.770 --> 50:34.840
I'm taking this elevator.
Tell me what floor they're on.

50:34.940 --> 50:36.920
So, what kind of music
do you like?

50:37.020 --> 50:41.450
- What?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted a hug.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.310
- What floor?
- Thirty-five. What?

50:46.410 --> 50:49.370
- What?
- Nothing.

50:49.540 --> 50:53.080
I just want to get upstairs.

50:54.750 --> 50:56.740
Walt, I gotta know what floor.

50:56.840 --> 50:59.860
I can't make out the buttons.
It's a high one.

50:59.960 --> 51:01.950
Can you pick 'em up
when they get off?

51:02.050 --> 51:06.600
I'd have to check
floor by floor. I'd lose 'em.

51:07.260 --> 51:10.560
Hang on. I got an idea.

51:24.990 --> 51:26.990
Come on, Walt.

51:27.070 --> 51:30.040
Yeah, this is McGahn in Security.

51:30.200 --> 51:34.750
Do we have a Ned Campbell
staying at the hotel?

51:39.590 --> 51:42.920
No, wait. It's going up.

51:43.760 --> 51:46.090
Walt!

51:48.970 --> 51:51.600
What room?

51:58.360 --> 52:01.820
- 3517.
- You're a genius.

52:28.590 --> 52:30.590
Come on. Come on.

52:30.680 --> 52:33.310
Yeah!

52:34.850 --> 52:37.520
Oh, my God!

53:06.130 --> 53:08.130
Please! Come on!

53:08.220 --> 53:12.810
The weather is more
important than me, baby?

53:13.430 --> 53:16.390
Look at me. Look at me! Yeah!

53:16.560 --> 53:20.720
- Honey, there's a hurricane on.
- So what? I'm hot.

53:20.730 --> 53:23.760
- Come on!
- You wanna play rough?

53:23.860 --> 53:26.820
I'll give you a little hurricane.

53:26.990 --> 53:28.990
I love it!

53:29.070 --> 53:32.100
Secretary of Defence
Charles Kirkland...

53:32.200 --> 53:35.230
is in critical condition at the
Atlantic City Medical Center...

53:35.330 --> 53:37.310
after being struck
by an assassin's bullet...

53:37.410 --> 53:40.440
while attending a boxing match
at the Atlantic City Arena.

53:40.540 --> 53:42.180
We've been getting live updates...

53:42.280 --> 53:44.610
from the only reporter
allowed inside the arena,

53:44.710 --> 53:49.300
a Lou Logan of
Powell Pay-Per-View Television...

54:01.400 --> 54:06.440
Could you hold it down in there?
People are trying to sleep!

54:06.610 --> 54:09.640
We've also learned that
Rabat left a suicide note...

54:09.740 --> 54:12.400
which was found on his body...

54:12.500 --> 54:17.430
by police in the moments
after the shooting took place.

54:51.450 --> 54:54.470
Hi. I hope you don't mind.
I borrowed your shirt.

54:54.570 --> 54:57.950
Not at all. I happen
to think women...

54:58.050 --> 55:00.940
look very sexy in men's shirts.

55:01.870 --> 55:04.830
- Okay.
- Can you...

55:05.000 --> 55:06.990
Just hold on one minute, okay?

55:07.090 --> 55:09.630
Oh, okay.

55:10.210 --> 55:12.210
Oh, please!

55:12.300 --> 55:13.900
Excuse me! You're the one...

55:14.000 --> 55:17.410
who was practically giving me
the knob job down in the bar.

55:17.510 --> 55:20.540
I'm sorry. I need a place where
I can just wait, and then I'll go.

55:20.640 --> 55:22.250
A place where you
can just wait and go.

55:22.350 --> 55:23.670
Well, what do you think this is,

55:23.770 --> 55:26.440
a bus stop?

55:34.200 --> 55:35.150
What, are you on
drugs? I should've...

55:35.250 --> 55:36.180
figured this out.
You look like hell.

55:36.280 --> 55:39.310
Did you come up here to rob me?
Is that what you were thinking?

55:39.410 --> 55:41.870
Look, I'm in trouble.
Somebody shot at me, okay?

55:41.970 --> 55:43.480
Now I've heard everything. Go.

55:43.580 --> 55:45.510
Do you know what's
going on tonight?

55:45.610 --> 55:46.610
Have you heard?

55:46.710 --> 55:48.271
Listen, I am a very
happily married man,

55:48.310 --> 55:49.790
and I don't need your
kind of trouble.

55:49.840 --> 55:52.800
- So let's go.
- Just a half an hour.

55:52.970 --> 55:54.950
- No, wait, please!
- Get out!

55:55.050 --> 55:57.040
- It's all right.
- Who are you?

55:57.140 --> 55:59.120
- Take a walk.
- What the hell's going on here?

55:59.220 --> 56:02.310
I said take a walk!

56:04.440 --> 56:06.440
It's my room, damn it!

56:06.520 --> 56:09.550
Hi. Remember me?
I'm Detective Santoro.

56:09.650 --> 56:11.380
I shoved you out of
the way of that bullet.

56:11.480 --> 56:11.630
Yeah.

56:11.730 --> 56:13.720
Can you please help me?
I need to get out of this building.

56:13.820 --> 56:18.950
The first thing we're gonna do is
get you outta this room.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.010
So you can calm down.

56:21.110 --> 56:22.790
We're gonna have a
little talk, okay?

56:22.890 --> 56:23.100
Yeah.

56:23.200 --> 56:26.170
This hotel sucks!

56:26.330 --> 56:26.990
What's the problem?

56:27.090 --> 56:28.411
Some guy just busted
into my room.

56:28.420 --> 56:32.760
- What guy? Where?
- Come on. I'll show ya.

56:36.760 --> 56:38.240
There I am, minding
my own business,

56:38.340 --> 56:39.790
writing a letter to my lovely wife,

56:39.890 --> 56:43.390
and some guy just busts in.

56:57.610 --> 57:01.680
She must've gone with him.
Hey, is that a silencer?

57:01.780 --> 57:05.040
What did he look like?

57:05.960 --> 57:08.110
Where are we going?
What's the matter with you?

57:08.210 --> 57:08.980
He's following me.

57:09.080 --> 57:12.110
You're with me now.
You're safe. I'm a cop.

57:12.210 --> 57:15.190
I'm gonna protect you
and serve you.

57:15.340 --> 57:16.660
We got a very cosy little...

57:16.760 --> 57:19.410
step here, so why don't we
just sit down and calm down.

57:19.510 --> 57:21.320
Take a deep breath.
How's your arm?

57:21.420 --> 57:22.540
It's fine, thanks.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.620
- You're not gonna die on me?
- No.

57:24.720 --> 57:26.710
- We can talk for a minute?
- Yeah.

57:26.810 --> 57:29.150
Okay.

57:29.940 --> 57:32.900
No, thank you.

57:33.070 --> 57:36.780
Why'd you run away from me?

57:38.280 --> 57:42.350
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.

57:42.450 --> 57:44.530
All right. I'm not interested
in what you don't know.

57:44.540 --> 57:49.290
What I'm interested in
is what you do know. Please.

57:49.750 --> 57:52.420
Okay.

57:52.880 --> 57:55.840
I... I work at Powell Aircraft.

57:56.010 --> 57:59.030
I put together the ballistics reports
we issue after weapons tests.

57:59.130 --> 58:02.160
- You're talking about missiles?
- Right.

58:02.260 --> 58:03.830
Now, the newest
missile, the AirGuard,

58:03.930 --> 58:05.290
I've been tracking its results...

58:05.390 --> 58:08.420
for the past couple of months,
and they are perfect.

58:08.520 --> 58:12.590
These tests are never perfect,
so I knew something was wrong,

58:12.690 --> 58:14.670
but I didn't know who I could trust.

58:14.770 --> 58:17.800
I sent an anonymous E-mail
to Secretary Kirkland...

58:17.900 --> 58:20.930
telling him that I suspected
that these results were doctored.

58:21.030 --> 58:26.080
He actually wrote me back,
and he told me to get him proof.

58:26.240 --> 58:28.850
Yesterday, I got it,
and I told him that

58:28.950 --> 58:31.360
I wanted to give it
to him in person.

58:31.460 --> 58:33.440
He told me to bring it
to the fight tonight.

58:33.540 --> 58:34.540
Secretary Kirkland,

58:34.640 --> 58:36.570
welcome to Atlantic City. Are
you here on official business?

58:36.670 --> 58:39.700
Not for a couple of hours.
I'm just another fight fan.

58:39.800 --> 58:41.700
I couldn't get near him when they...

58:41.800 --> 58:43.870
first came in. Powell
was all over him.

58:43.970 --> 58:45.960
The South Jersey worker
we are interested in tonight...

58:46.060 --> 58:48.040
is the Atlantic City Executioner.

58:48.140 --> 58:51.170
So I decided
to wait until the fight started.

58:51.270 --> 58:52.860
And I had no idea...

58:52.960 --> 58:58.570
where they were sitting, so I
went up top to get a better view.

59:48.620 --> 59:51.650
All right.
Hold it, hold it. Stop right there.

59:51.750 --> 59:54.720
This is Dunne you're talking about.

59:54.870 --> 59:56.800
Naval uniform?
Commander Kevin Dunne?

59:56.900 --> 59:57.900
Right.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.930
Talking with Rabat before
he shoots Kirkland?

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.030
Yeah.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.390
I recognized him,
and I'd just seen him come in.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:03.120
No, then you saw wrong.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.240
It wasn't Dunne.
He could not be a part of it.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:10.140
Will you just listen to the rest?

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.540
- I'm sorry.
- That seat's taken.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.670
But you can sit here.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.820
- Well, I'll just need one minute.
- Me too.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.010
It's in the pocket.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.380
Excuse me. Did
you say something?

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.170
It's in the pocket.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.180
- Possible make.
- Pocket?

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:54.930
So you've been writing to me.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.340
Just look in the
envelope, Mr Secretary.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440
What is it?

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.460
It's the satellite infra-reds
from yesterday's tests.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.420
They gave me those.
They showed convergent impact.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.590
They gave you doctored copies.

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:05.060
These are the originals from
the proving ground computers.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:05.680
Make is good. Stand by.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.760
Please, just look for yourself.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.830
- Okay.
- She has the infra-reds.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:12.100
I need you to look at
the heat flashes...

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:12.980
here at the moment of impact.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.600
If the AirGuard had made full
intercept like it's supposed to,

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.060
Start the count.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.290
Copy.

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:17.150
There would be one dot,
but there's two every time.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.811
The target blows up,
but the AirGuard...

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.280
never gets within
ten metres of it.

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.490
Then why would the
target blow up?

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:22.360
Bring on the pain, baby!

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.900
Because they rigged
it, Mr Secretary.

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:25.531
They put on a fireworks
display for you.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.030
The AirGuard doesn't
work, and the...

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:28.620
company knows the
system doesn't work,

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.700
but they're pushing it
through anyway.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.190
I know what they're thinking...

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.870
we get it approved now, say
we're sorry and fix it later.

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:35.640
But I am telling you,

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.960
you're the one that's
gonna be sorry.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.050
Jesus Christ!
Bert Powell's out of his mind.

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:42.170
If you deploy that weapons system
and a war breaks out...

01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:44.260
- All right. I get the picture.
- Hello? Who?

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.340
Don't make plans for
the next six months, young lady.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.990
You're going to be sending
some people to jail.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.410
That's not what happened.
That's not what happened.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:15.540
I'm sorry. I wish I didn't know
any of this either.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.670
Who the hell do you
think you are, lady?

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:20.970
Sticking your nose in
where it doesn't...

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.840
belong. You're
a number cruncher.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.900
Just crunch the goddam numbers!

01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:28.070
I was doing my job.

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:29.231
I mean, we were creating...

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.180
a defense system that was
supposed to save people's lives.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.090
They're building the factory...

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.350
in a disadvantaged
part of the state.

01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:37.440
- This was a good thing to do.
- 'This was a good thing to do'.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.410
Jesus, somebody hands you a line,

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:41.610
you just swallow it
whole, don't you?

01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:43.690
Just a little Goody Two-shoes.

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:45.780
Yeah, I believed in what we
were doing, and they corrupted it.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.920
So somebody had to speak up.
I mean, it's important.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.030
Does it feel important now? Did it
feel important when the bullet hit?

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.080
I had no choice.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.210
I can't live with the blood
of innocent soldiers on me, okay?

01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:59.270
- Whose side are you on?
- My side.

01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:02.460
That E-mail. You let 'em know
you were coming.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.820
They just sat back and waited
for you to show your face.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.640
No, I was careful.

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:08.720
I waited till Powell left.
I didn't sit down till it was clear.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.850
No, you sat down exactly
when they wanted you to.

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:12.960
They opened the door,

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.970
and you walked on
through right on cue.

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:17.380
They didn't miss him with...

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.620
that second shot.
They missed you.

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:26.500
I thought I'd get fired,
not... killed.

01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:30.630
What do we do now?

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.720
Well, are you a cop or aren't you?

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:36.980
I can't get past the
men at the doors...

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.960
by myself, but
with you I'd be fine.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.310
You get me outside,
you don't have to...

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.040
think about me again.

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:46.260
- I can take care of myself.
- You've done a hell of a job so far.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Look, I'm sorry if I...

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.510
- Who gives a shit if you're sorry?
- What are you mad at me for?

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:54.600
Because I didn't have to know!

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.730
You decided to have
this problem, not me!

01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:00.850
My world would've gone on turning
just fine, but now either way I look,

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:03.980
I have to do something
I don't want to do.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.380
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.150
I do not want to do this!

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.760
Do what?

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.940
How old are you?

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:33.190
I'm 26.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.240
Do you have a,
a family around here?

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:39.450
My mother in New York.

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.530
Do you have a husband?

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.620
- No.
- Boyfriend?

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.670
Why are you asking me all this?

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.790
Kevin. Kevin Dunne.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.480
You're positive he's
the one you saw...

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:53.050
with Rabat before
the shots were fired?

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.400
Let me tell you a little
something about Kevin Dunne.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.120
You know him.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.440
He is one of the most honourable
dudes on the planet!

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.330
You know him. You know him.

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.460
Yeah, I know him. And you could
be wrong. Yeah, you could.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.590
There were people
rushing in front of you,

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:09.670
and you were nervous,
and you were scared.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.310
You could be wrong.
Isn't it possible?

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:11.760
Yes. Yes.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.860
Isn't it so?

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.890
Yeah, now that I think about
it, I think I could be wrong.

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:18.010
You remember
I told you that my glasses,

01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:21.140
they had fallen off,
and I couldn't quite focus.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.680
I don't think it was him.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.360
Shit. Your glasses didn't fall
off till after the gunshots...

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.460
Nah, shit!

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.500
What happened with the girl?

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:35.740
A cop shoved her out of the way,
and he's got her now somewhere.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.340
The cop? You mean your cop?

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:42.310
Yes.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:43.920
But it's all good, right,

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.120
because you said
he's controllable?

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:47.220
Absolutely.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.350
He's only chasing
this down because...

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:51.380
he thinks it's a
career opportunity.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.480
Chasing it down, what?
You said he'd sit back.

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:58.680
This doesn't sound
like he's sitting back.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.010
It sounds like he's conducting...

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:04.940
an active investigation, a
very dangerous investigation.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.730
Kirkland died ten minutes ago.

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:09.110
Five minutes from now,
I gotta be on TV.

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:10.690
Now, what is it, yes or no? We got...

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.240
a goddam Columbo
runnin' around loose?

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.130
No operation goes
exactly as planned.

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.410
You don't panic.

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:19.470
Stay calm and tie up loose ends.

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:21.670
What do you think I've been doing
for the last hour?

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.350
Jesus Christ!
This is not the plan I invested in!

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:29.960
In the plan I bought,
that prairie populist...

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.080
who was criminally dismantling...

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.130
the entire armed
forces, goes down!

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:38.240
The disloyal employee,
she goes down with him.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.430
The fanatical terrorist,
he takes the rap.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.560
The AirGuard missile
contract is approved,

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:48.730
and I... I get enough money to finish
the goddam Millennium!

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:51.790
It was a good plan!

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.990
No humiliation,
no scandal, no prison!

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:58.340
We're still contained.

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:05.410
Once the girl is gone,
it's only me and two men I trust.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:07.510
Two?

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.560
I thought there were four.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:14.650
Do we have another
acceptable loss?

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:21.530
I'm not on that list, am I?

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.440
- You'll be safe in here.
- Safe?

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.500
I'm giving you a place to hide.

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:35.650
Look, I don't wanna hide.
I wanna get out, okay?

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:38.770
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Take you out through the casino.

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:39.820
Where are you go...

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.880
Rick? Rick, the door's locked!

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:45.050
Rick?

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.510
Rick, let me out, please!

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:52.370
Rick, please, just let me out, okay?

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.400
I'll get out on my own!

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.510
Rick!

01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:58.610
Hey, Rick!

01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:01.570
- Yeah.
- Here.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.850
Come on. It's the five grand
for letting me be the guy.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:07.910
There's something extra here.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.080
You're all heart, Rick.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.190
I can't believe
we got called out in this rain.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.750
Can you believe this, man?

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.740
Sir, this entire area is now the site
of an F.B.I. investigation.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.390
You have to leave. Okay.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.850
Log in Santoro. He's A.C. Police.

01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:44.470
Here comes the pain, baby!

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:48.779
Here comes the pain!
Here comes the pain!

01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:56.920
You're a bum, Lincoln Tyler!
How could you do... He's a bum!

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.500
Man!

01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:00.710
Hello. What?

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.220
Hi, Ricky! It's me.
I'm here, sweetie.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.279
- Who are you? Where?
- I'm here, sweetie!

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.410
- It's me, your lucky number!
- My lucky number?

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:10.470
I'm here.

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:32.439
It's called the Zero
Gravity Flying Eye.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.220
New camera. Got it
in this morning.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:35.560
So nobody knew you had it?

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.660
Well, I knew.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.750
It's remote control.

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:44.760
It floated all around the arena
to get crowd reaction.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.350
Let me see its tape.

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:04.690
I need to look at this part alone.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.360
Come on.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.910
You're the man.

01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:40.730
Oh, man.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.900
Oh, man.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.480
They were specifically told...

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.980
they couldn't have
a camera up there.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.710
Don't give me that wounded look.
You haven't got the face for it.

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:18.810
I just received word...

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:21.920
Secretary Charles Evans
Kirkland is dead.

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.570
He passed away at 10:48 p. m.

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:29.220
At this time I'd like to extend
my deepest sympathies...

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.860
to the secretary's family...

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.490
and to the nation...

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.790
and to the people that...

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:41.210
he so faithfully
and proudly served.

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:45.460
And...

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:51.670
I have something else to say.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:55.290
To those that would try
to bully us or to terrorize us,

01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:59.550
to divert us from the causes
of peace and justice,

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.560
Kevin.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.710
I want you to know that in spite of
what's happened here tonight,

01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:07.810
we are not deterred.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:12.950
Production of the AirGuard
missile system will go ahead...

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:17.279
in accordance with
Secretary Kirkland's wishes.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.290
It's called the first draft of history.

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:24.420
It's going to hold.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:27.540
Why did it have to be me?

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.670
Why'd you want me next to you?

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.840
One, I needed a cop
to back up my alibi.

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.010
Two,

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.120
I knew you could be bought
if anything went wrong.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.540
No of fence, pal, but
I never thought...

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.290
you'd get as far as you did.

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:47.360
You're my best friend.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.230
You used me,

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:53.610
made me a sucker,

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.740
and that hurts me,

01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:00.910
because I would've done
anything for you.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.790
Then tell me where the girl is.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.770
She didn't do nothing
wrong. She was...

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.290
just trying to save
some guys' lives,

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.360
soldiers, like you used to be.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.450
I mean, who the hell
are you now, anyway?

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:15.510
Don't talk to me about soldiers.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.660
What do you know
about being a good soldier,

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.720
the guy who finds an envelope full...

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:19.750
of cash in a squad
car every Friday?

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:21.830
What do you think I've been doing
for the last ten years?

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:26.099
Strutting on the boardwalk
and picking up hookers?

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:29.130
When the Renville took that
lraqi missile hit below decks,

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:31.220
do you know what happened?

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.720
A hole ripped open
in the bulkhead,

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.390
and the sea flooded in.

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:39.560
We had 60 seconds to maintain
watertight integrity.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.940
I had to go below
and give the order...

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.640
to dog the hatches.

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.700
That meant... that 28 men...

01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.810
that were still in...

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:50.140
the main engine
space were trapped.

01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:56.010
You ever listen
to a man drowning?

01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:00.680
They don't die quietly.

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:04.580
Those men deserved
a decent point defense system.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.680
The AirGuard is it.

01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:09.730
Yeah, it has glitches, but...

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.800
you don't abandon
the whole system...

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.920
because of a few bugs.

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.020
You fix it.

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:17.110
Charles Kirkland...

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.200
was a politician.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.240
A baby kisser, not a soldier.

01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:26.480
And when the political wind
said, 'Cut defense spending',

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:30.650
he started playing political games
with real soldiers' lives.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.740
He forced Powell into an early test.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.210
He positioned the system to fail,

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:35.860
because he didn't
want to pay for it.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.550
So we pay.

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:42.600
We die.

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:48.520
We need the AirGuard,

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.550
and that girl is
in the way now, Rick.

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:56.110
Just tell me where she is.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.080
All right, Rick.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.290
Pick a number.

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:11.370
How much is it gonna take...

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.400
for you to look the other
way like you have all your life?

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:17.340
Three hundred grand?
Five hundred?

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.970
750?

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.760
A million dollars.

01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:26.640
One million.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.040
A million bucks.
You hit the jackpot here.

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:33.350
All you have to do
is cash in the ticket.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.800
Don't you think Angela would like...

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.380
a few nice things
for once in her life?

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.320
Don't you think
she deserves them?

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:07.560
I never killed nobody.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.720
What?

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:12.770
I said I never killed nobody.

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:16.900
You won't have to.
She's my problem.

01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:20.070
You just tell me where she is...

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.280
and never hear
another word about her.

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:29.620
One million dollars.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.610
I know that's
a whole shitload of money, but...

01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:00.570
I can't do it.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:06.910
Kevin, you just pulled
a gun on me.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.160
Get back.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.740
Or what?

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:14.870
Oh, God!

01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:23.590
Goddam it. I'm under a lot
of pressure here, all right?

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:28.970
Be smart.

01:17:29.050 --> 01:17:32.020
Just take the money.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.210
Please, Rick.
You're all alone on this.

01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:37.310
What about Tyler?

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.280
Yeah. If he talked to me,
he'll talk to somebody else.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.540
Lincoln and I
have come to an understanding.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.380
You got nothin', kiddo.

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:09.050
Snake eyes. The house wins.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.520
- Now, where is she?
- Fuck you.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.770
Don't make it so he can't talk.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:24.220
Why don't you at least try, man?

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.030
I am trying.

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:31.520
That's not a punch. Come on,
girlie man. Show me what you got.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.620
Champ. This the champ?

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.950
Look, why don't you
just shut up, man.

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:39.090
This'll go a lot easier.

01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:46.060
Sounds like
three broken ribs to me!

01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:49.180
What is this, a heroic stand?

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.330
You're the wrong guy for it, Rick.

01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:52.430
You'll be all alone in...

01:18:52.530 --> 01:18:54.460
the spotlight, and guys like
you can't stand up to that light.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.600
You'll burn up under it.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:57.721
The press starts looking...

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.670
for dirt on you, and they
will, it'll be a mud slide.

01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:02.800
Forget about your job,
your sweet life in Margate.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.880
Start thinkin' about jail!

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.010
Your girlfriend will be gone, too,
at the first sign of trouble,

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:11.140
but not before she has
a little chat with Angela!

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.220
So say goodbye to your wife too!

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.330
Twice a month with Michael...

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:16.350
won't be so bad if you can
get him to spend a night...

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:19.410
in your shitty apartment!

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.570
You'll lose it all,
my friend! Everything!

01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:23.750
And your whole connected
life will fall...

01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:25.740
the hell apart. Is
that what you want?

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.820
All you gotta do is be consistent,
for Christ's sake.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.890
Do what you always
do... take the money!

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.950
You wanna be a hero?

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:34.080
You wanna do something
for your country?

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:37.890
Then tell me where the girl is!

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:11.720
If it was anybody but me,
you'd be dead.

01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:27.820
I'll be back in half an hour.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.080
Lower. Stop.

01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:21.490
Lower.

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:24.290
Stop. Lower.

01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:27.040
Stop.

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:59.490
This is great stuff.

01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:02.620
You know, we could sell
this to local.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.890
Who could we get outside
for a stand-up?

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:29.730
Package is on the boardwalk.

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:31.820
Needs pick up
at the Millennium entrance.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.460
Let's go.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.720
Goddam it! Shit!

01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:25.000
I'd like to know what I did wrong
to get all the shit assignments!

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.080
Just roll so we can get outta here!

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.480
In five, four, three...

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.440
Well, it looks like
Tropical Storm Jezebel...

01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:41.440
just may be a hurricane after all.

01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:10.870
We are live on the boardwalk.

01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:15.050
As you can see behind me,
the huge metal globe...

01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:19.220
that is the emblem of the
Powell Millennium lies shattered.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.160
Anthea, you look great, hon. Wait,

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:25.320
can you get any
closer to the globe?

01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:27.990
Julia?

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:31.120
Julia?

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:43.970
This is an extremely hazardous...

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:48.030
Hang on. The Police
Emergency Unit should...

01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:50.340
I think I see their truck.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.060
Julia!

01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:59.270
Julia!

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.480
Julia!

01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:14.910
Kevin.

01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:19.690
Tell her to unlock the door
and come out.

01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:22.050
No.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.910
No, I won't tell her to unlock it.

01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:28.010
Get outta the way!

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:34.150
The police are here...

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:37.420
and are waving us
off the boardwalk.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.110
All right.

01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:42.650
Okay.

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:45.650
She's all yours.

01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:51.200
What the hell is that?

01:26:56.290 --> 01:26:59.320
Goddam it, Rick!
I don't want to kill you!

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:01.750
Okay.

01:27:14.010 --> 01:27:16.560
Look out!

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.510
- Put the gun down!
- On the ground right now!

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.640
- Lower your gun now, sir!
- No, wait! Wait a minute! Wait!

01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.730
- I'm with D.O.D.!
- Put it down now!

01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:35.810
- Listen to me! Listen!
- Put the gun down!

01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:38.870
This... This woman is a suspect!

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.070
- We'll be forced to fire.
- No, she's a suspect, goddam it!

01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:45.200
- I am Commander Kevin Dunne.
- I suggest you drop it now!

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:46.580
And this woman is a threat...

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.320
to the security of
the United States.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:51.300
Rick, tell 'em!

01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:56.220
Please, for God's sake,
tell 'em what we got here!

01:27:56.770 --> 01:27:59.730
There's no 'we', Kevin!

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:03.900
- You got snake eyes!
- Put the gun down, sir!

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:07.090
- Drop the gun, sir!
- Put the gun down!

01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:09.180
- Now put it on the ground!
- Put the gun down!

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.240
Sir, please look at me!
You need to pay attention!

01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:12.310
Now!

01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:15.430
Yes. Now, put the gun
on the floor, sir.

01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:18.500
- Put the gun down!
- Please.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.650
- We know who you are... No!
- Don't move, sir!

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:22.930
Let go of the handle!
Back away from...

01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:24.820
the door slowly and turn around!

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.950
- Slowly!
- We need to take the gun away.

01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:31.070
- Hands where I can see 'em!
- Sir, please!

01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:34.510
Please put it down, sir!

01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:41.500
Get a paramedic quick!
Call for a paramedic now!

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.940
Get them outta here!

01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.840
Today in Brighton
Park, Richard Santoro,

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.560
Atlantic City's new police hero,

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.010
received a special valour
award for heroism...

01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:56.100
from Mayor Frank Sanchini.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.680
The mayor extended
the public's thanks...

01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:59.230
to Santoro for his
lifesaving efforts...

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:01.310
on behalf of Julia Costello,

01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:02.810
the Powell Aircraft researcher...

01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.440
who exposed the
deadly conspiracy...

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.440
that led to the assassination...

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.610
of Defence Secretary
Charles Kirkland.

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:10.710
Hey, Rick! Over here!

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.440
Hero cop Richard.

01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:12.780
Santoro took a
well-deserved break...

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.910
from police work today
with his son.

01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:17.850
Meanwhile, the AirGuard
investigation...

01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:19.040
continued in Washington,

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.170
and Gilbert Powell announced
more firings at Powell Aircraft...

01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:24.310
as he cleans house in the wake
of the assassination.

01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:26.350
There he is.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.420
Richard Santoro's
moment in the public eye...

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.970
produced an
unexpected backlash...

01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.570
this week...

01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:33.640
as allegations of corruption
swirled around him.

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.740
Would you back off?

01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.810
I'm Ricky, all right? Come on!

01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:39.540
There have been
allegations of bribery...

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.961
coming out of the mayor's office.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.020
- Could you comment on those?
- What about the cocaine...

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120
Cocaine, my ass!

01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:47.190
Santoro was unwilling
to comment on the reports...

01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:49.280
which have come
from numerous sources,

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:52.020
both in the police department
and elsewhere.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.450
Give us a smile, Ricky!

01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:54.790
We're waiting here outside...

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.580
of the Atlanta County
Superior Court...

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.660
for Richard Santoro
who's just been indicted...

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.800
on charges stemming
from incidents that have been...

01:30:00.850 --> 01:30:04.920
Where you going? Hey, hey,
hey, Rick! Could you... Mr Santoro!

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:07.580
Mr Santoro, could you comment...

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.990
on this indictment,
sir? Mr Santoro!

01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:37.190
What are you tryin' to do, kill me?

01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:40.370
- Yeah. Nice goin', Al.
- Hey, that's what hard hats are for.

01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:43.530
A reporter told me
where to find you.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:47.600
I came twice before,
but you were out.

01:30:47.770 --> 01:30:52.440
Yeah, I've had a lot
of social engagements lately.

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.970
Yeah, I was surprised
you stayed in town.

01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:58.030
I thought you'd wanna move away.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.610
Actually, I'm gonna be
spending some time upstate.

01:31:01.710 --> 01:31:02.270
Upstate?

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:10.610
I keep dreaming
I'm back in that tunnel,

01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:12.710
underwater,

01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:15.760
only in my dream I drowned.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.950
Wonder what they
would've said about me then.

01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:22.010
You didn't have to do
what you did,

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:25.210
and I know what it cost you,
and if it helps I just...

01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:27.290
Don't try to make
a hero out of me. It won't fit.

01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:28.830
If I hadn't put a face to you,

01:31:28.930 --> 01:31:31.460
things probably would've
gone a whole lot different.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.480
But they didn't.

01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:37.720
I testified this morning
at the AirGuard hearings.

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:41.820
- Yeah? How'd it go?
- Very well, I think.

01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:43.980
The whole system
is being dumped.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.060
The company's being
completely restructured.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.160
There are gonna be...

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:49.190
all sorts of indictments up
and down the administration,

01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:51.280
and things have really changed.

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:52.400
I know you may not...

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.400
wanna see it right
now, but it's true.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:58.880
It's gonna be so different
in Atlantic City.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.790
You know, they say
back 200,300 years ago...

01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:07.960
pirates put phoney lighthouses
right out by those big rocks,

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:10.060
right out there.

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:14.210
Ships would set a course
by the lights, crash on the rocks,

01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:17.340
then everybody'd go out
and rob 'em blind.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.470
Only one thing's changed
since then...

01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:23.530
lights are brighter.

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:28.000
- I'm naive.
- There's worse things to be.

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:31.250
Yeah.

01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:37.050
How old are you?

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.300
Thirty-five.

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:44.390
- You got family around here?
- Yeah.

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.550
You got a wife?

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.390
She ran away.

01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:53.770
- Girlfriend?
- Well, she ran away too.

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.970
- Sorry.
- Well, it could've been worse.

01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:58.070
How?

01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:01.650
They could've run
away with each other.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.280
Yeah.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.330
So, maybe in about
12 to 18 months...

01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:10.240
from now I'll give you a call.

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:13.750
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.260
Hey.

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.910
What the hell.
At least I got to be on TV.

01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:49.050
Come on. Let's go.
Get back to work.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.230
You guys get this done.
Come on. Everybody up. Let's go.

01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:54.860
