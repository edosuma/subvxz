(mellow music playing)

00:57.900 --> 01:02.500
(humming "Jingle Bells")

01:06.600 --> 01:07.633
Hey!

01:09.266 --> 01:12.867
Rose, for a half hour, you've been humming
"Jingle Bells" and yelling "hey."

01:12.934 --> 01:14.567
Why must you do that?

01:14.633 --> 01:16.967
Because it's too hard to hum the "hey."

01:20.900 --> 01:23.100
Oh, boy, it is hell out there.

01:23.567 --> 01:27.700
It must be at least 103,
and the mall was impossible.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.266
Did you get something
for the grandchildren?

01:29.333 --> 01:32.767
Oh, please.
Robbie wants a batman hat.

01:32.834 --> 01:36.133
Six different stores were all sold out.

01:36.200 --> 01:41.500
I found a store where there was one left,
and another woman saw it.

01:41.567 --> 01:46.200
Oh, I cannot believe a person would push
a stranger out of the way,

01:46.266 --> 01:50.867
step on her hand, and elbow her forehead,
just for a batman hat...

01:51.433 --> 01:52.834
but I did it anyway.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.333
I got the hat.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.200
I just have this thing about giving gifts

02:00.266 --> 02:03.800
that are more fun than those
my grandparents gave me.

02:03.867 --> 02:06.066
Ma, do you remember that Christmas

02:06.133 --> 02:09.500
they gave me soap
shaped like the seven dwarfs?

02:09.567 --> 02:13.233
-What's wrong with that?
-What kid wants to play with soap?

02:13.300 --> 02:16.700
After a few baths,
they looked like seven suppositories.

02:17.934 --> 02:19.433
(doorbell rings)

02:23.900 --> 02:26.834
Hi, it's me, Stan.
I brought you a gift.

02:26.900 --> 02:32.233
Oh, why, thank you, Stanley.
Oh, and look, there's a little card.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.700
"Merry Christmas,
<i>Sports Illustrated </i>subscriber."

02:37.333 --> 02:42.467
-You don't have a baseball radio, do you?
-Why are you really here?

02:42.533 --> 02:45.467
I am going to make
all you women wealthy.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.767
How come whenever my ship comes in,
it's leaking?

02:50.166 --> 02:53.266
I am planning on opening
a research and development lab.

02:53.333 --> 02:58.266
We can develop exciting new novelties that
will make today's plastic vomit obsolete.

02:58.734 --> 03:02.867
To make this happen,
I only need $1,000 apiece.

03:02.934 --> 03:05.033
-What do you say?
-(all) No.

03:06.567 --> 03:09.233
Ok. Make it a $100, but no monthly report.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.367
Goodbye, Stanley.

03:10.433 --> 03:14.000
Why don't I wait outside
while you think it over?

03:14.066 --> 03:15.300
Fine, fine.

03:15.367 --> 03:18.300
If he's still here in the morning,
let's give him coffee.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.000
A nightmare. We've been visited
by the yutz of Christmas past.

03:23.867 --> 03:27.100
I'm drained of what little
holiday spirit I had.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.433
We still have to shop
for presents for each other.

03:30.500 --> 03:36.233
I've been giving this some thought.
None of us wants to shop in this heat.

03:36.300 --> 03:40.700
Why don't we put names into a hat,
then we just get a gift

03:40.767 --> 03:42.867
for the person we pick?

03:42.934 --> 03:47.533
There's one problem with your plan.
One of us will get the gift from Rose.

03:52.133 --> 03:53.300
Dorothy, she's right.

03:53.367 --> 03:58.800
You know how hard it is pretending to like
Rose's gifts. Forget it. No way.

03:58.867 --> 04:01.533
Oh, come on, Blanche.
Don't be so childish.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.200
We each stand an equal chance
of having our Christmas ruined.

04:06.400 --> 04:11.000
-I won't mind getting Rose's gift.
-Dorothy's right. Be a good sport.

04:11.467 --> 04:16.567
-(humming "Jingle Bells")
-I have to tell you about Christmas.

04:16.633 --> 04:21.367
It's too hot to shop, stores are mobbed,
there are only two days left,

04:21.433 --> 04:27.200
so we're going to draw names out of a hat.
That way we only have to buy one gift.

04:27.266 --> 04:30.667
But I love shopping,
and I love giving gifts.

04:30.734 --> 04:35.300
And besides, if we draw names,
whose names are they going to be anyway?

04:43.567 --> 04:45.433
The Oak Ridge Boys, Rose.

04:47.433 --> 04:50.200
-Our names.
-Oh!

04:51.700 --> 04:53.500
I'm not sure about this.

04:53.567 --> 04:57.000
When you think about Christmas,
don't you think about giving gifts?

04:57.066 --> 05:02.266
Yes, but that's not the first thing.
I think of Christmas in New York,

05:02.333 --> 05:07.100
the decorations in Macy's window,
the show at Radio City...

05:07.400 --> 05:10.734
skaters on the ice at Mitsubishi center.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.200
On Christmas eve, we went to midnight
mass. Remember, Dorothy?

05:20.266 --> 05:24.834
Oh, sure I do. The music and the candles.
It was beautiful.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.567
The mass was in Latin,
a fine old Italian language.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.934
Now, who knows?
Sometimes it's in English,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.967
sometimes in Spanish. If you ask me,
they should go back to Latin,

05:36.033 --> 05:38.200
the language Jesus spoke.

05:40.934 --> 05:44.000
-Ma, he spoke Hebrew.
-Even in church?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.367
You know, I've been thinking.

05:47.433 --> 05:50.033
Oh, that would explain the beads of sweat.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.066
Maybe Dorothy's right.

05:56.700 --> 06:00.133
I don't need a shopping spree
to give me Christmas spirit.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.200
My church is serving dinner to the poor
hungry people in the neighborhood.

06:04.266 --> 06:08.100
I volunteered to serve.
That'll do the trick for me.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.500
Then let's do it.

06:09.567 --> 06:14.633
Remember, you only buy
for the person whose name you pick.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.767
It doesn't matter who picks you,
because it's bound to be a terrific gift.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.000
Go ahead, Blanche.

06:20.066 --> 06:27.066
-Ok, I buy for... Dorothy.
-Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes! Oh, yes!

06:29.700 --> 06:31.000
Oh!

06:33.967 --> 06:37.567
Boy, Blanche, I didn't realize
you were such a big spender.

06:38.567 --> 06:43.266
-Go ahead, Dorothy.
-Ok, I buy for... ma!

06:43.333 --> 06:44.467
Yes!

06:53.200 --> 06:56.300
This really was a good idea.
This is really fun.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.166
Oh, shut up, Rose.

06:58.934 --> 07:00.867
-Is it my turn?
-Yeah.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.600
-I buy for... Rose!
-Oh, thank you, God.

07:09.967 --> 07:12.834
No, no, no, Rose,
you can't pick yourself.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.000
Oh, thank goodness.
I'm so hard to shop for.

07:17.233 --> 07:20.266
-Rose, you buy for...
-Blanche.

07:20.867 --> 07:24.266
Ok, thanks, Dorothy.
This really was a good idea.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.800
I don't want to spoil the surprise,

07:26.867 --> 07:32.000
but in a few weeks, someone in this room
will know how to yodel.

07:39.467 --> 07:46.100
(serene music playing)

07:47.834 --> 07:52.767
Your brother Phil, God rest his brain,
gives the worst presents in the world.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.900
What kind of gift is dental floss?

07:58.333 --> 08:02.066
-Well, it's waxed and mint flavored.
-Here, go floss yourself.

08:04.767 --> 08:08.533
-This stinks. I sent him a swell gift.
-What?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.000
A catalogue item.

08:11.266 --> 08:13.934
-L.L. Bean?
-Victoria's secret.

08:16.066 --> 08:18.467
Here's my present
from Kirsten.

08:18.533 --> 08:21.633
She always knows just what
her mother wants.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.367
It's a St. Olaf snowball.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.667
Rose, there's only snow in there.

08:29.734 --> 08:32.033
That's what St. Olaf looks like in winter.

08:34.467 --> 08:37.400
Who's for some fresh-baked
Christmas cookies?

08:37.467 --> 08:42.166
Why are the Christmas cookies in the shape
of American flags and liberty bells?

08:43.033 --> 08:45.066
I couldn't find the Christmas cookie
cutters,

08:45.133 --> 08:47.734
so I used the fourth of July
cookie cutters instead.

08:49.767 --> 08:52.767
I wonder where president Bush stands
on eating the flag?

08:59.166 --> 09:03.233
That's all the presents, except
for the ones we know are fruitcakes.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.500
What about the present
Blanche hid behind the couch?

09:06.567 --> 09:08.834
Oh, my gift for you! I'll get it.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.567
-I want to see the look on your face.
-Me, too.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.133
Here you go, sweetheart.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.767
Why, Rose!

09:25.166 --> 09:28.800
-It's a beautiful blouse!
-I hope it's all right.

09:28.867 --> 09:31.633
Dorothy said you'd like
something crotch less.

09:41.967 --> 09:46.867
I'm due in church in about half an hour.
They start serving dinner at 1:00.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.066
I better get ready.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.433
Rose. Rose, could you use some extra help?

09:51.500 --> 09:54.467
-All the help we can get.
-I'm going with you.

09:54.533 --> 09:56.166
Hey, count me in.

09:56.233 --> 09:59.367
Since I didn't get a gift
I have to bury in the back yard,

09:59.433 --> 10:01.500
I'm feeling Christmassy, too.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.600
-Ma, are you coming?
-But I rented <i>Scarface.</i>

10:11.266 --> 10:12.900
All right, I'll go, too.

10:12.967 --> 10:15.367
I got an idea.

10:15.433 --> 10:18.433
We got all these fruitcakes
from this Christmas, last Christmas,

10:18.500 --> 10:22.266
and the Christmas before that.
Why don't we gather them and--

10:22.333 --> 10:24.266
And what, build a bomb shelter?

10:25.667 --> 10:29.934
No. We can unload them, I mean, bring them
to the church for dessert.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.433
Actually, I think that's very nice.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.867
Like we say in St. Olaf,
Christmas without fruitcake

10:36.934 --> 10:41.066
is like St. Sigmund's day
without the headless boy.

10:50.100 --> 10:55.500
(mellow music playing)

11:04.300 --> 11:08.934
Before we open, I want to thank you
for taking time from your Christmas

11:09.000 --> 11:11.367
to provide Christmas for others.

11:11.433 --> 11:15.767
We're turning away no one, remembering how
Mary and Joseph were turned away.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.567
Reverend Avery, it's always puzzled me,

11:18.633 --> 11:21.967
why didn't Mary and Joseph
call ahead for reservations?

11:26.333 --> 11:30.266
Surely they must have realized
how impossible it is to get a hotel room

11:30.333 --> 11:31.934
during the Christmas season.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.000
I guess that's one for the theologians,
Rose.

11:38.934 --> 11:43.300
I can never get used to serving turkey.
It's un-Sicilian.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.800
-What did you serve?
-Eels.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.133
-Eels?
-Yeah, it's true.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.200
They're a tradition.

11:52.266 --> 11:58.000
After Christmas, it's eel croquettes,
eel hash.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.967
I miss a traditional St. Olaf Christmas.

12:02.033 --> 12:05.367
Do we have time to run out
and get hit by a bus?

12:07.433 --> 12:09.200
First the Christmas pageant

12:09.266 --> 12:13.033
with the shepherds and the angels
and the two wise men.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.467
-Three wise men, Rose.
-Not in St. Olaf.

12:17.734 --> 12:21.734
Then we'd all go down to the town square
and form a circle.

12:22.166 --> 12:27.500
-We'd go home and smoke kippers.
-Why, Rose?

12:27.567 --> 12:30.300
It's the best way to make your house
to smell like kippers.

12:31.033 --> 12:36.934
And then it was traditional to let all the
animals sleep inside that night.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.867
The next morning,
the rumors would start.

12:43.934 --> 12:46.133
They'd continue until new year's,

12:46.200 --> 12:49.400
and we'd make resolutions that it would
never happen again.

12:49.934 --> 12:53.433
But then next year,
all it took was eggnog

12:53.500 --> 12:56.900
and a wise guy saying,
"What the hell? It's Christmas."

12:59.767 --> 13:02.800
All right, volunteers.
Stand by. I'm opening the doors.

13:05.433 --> 13:07.834
Welcome, welcome, everybody.
Merry Christmas.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.367
-I never thought there'd be children.
-I know.

13:12.967 --> 13:15.100
What is Santa Claus doing here?

13:15.166 --> 13:18.900
They pay these poor out-of-work guys
10, 15 bucks

13:18.967 --> 13:22.734
to stand on street corners ringing their
bells for charitable contributions.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.333
A lot of them can't afford a meal.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.600
-Hello there.
-Hello, Santa Claus.

13:31.433 --> 13:34.100
Dorothy, it's me, Stanley.

13:36.567 --> 13:40.633
(calm music playing)

13:43.333 --> 13:49.433
(calm music continues playing)

13:58.800 --> 14:01.567
Stan, what are you doing here?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.433
What happened with the research
and development deal?

14:04.500 --> 14:08.100
I was trying to get some cash
to tide me over.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.834
You were going to cheat us?

14:09.900 --> 14:11.834
Oh, sure, if you want to label everything.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.567
Stan, how could you?

14:14.633 --> 14:18.834
Did you want me to say I'm broke,
I miscalculated the public taste?

14:19.467 --> 14:23.100
I thought I would go through the roof
with my plastic reindeer poop.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.600
That's what happens
when you aim too high.

14:28.767 --> 14:31.567
Then I figured, with the drought
and fire dangers,

14:31.633 --> 14:34.834
the novelty item that would take off
this season

14:34.900 --> 14:38.400
is a little Santa driving a fire engine.

14:38.467 --> 14:41.000
I put every last cent into that hunch.

14:41.066 --> 14:43.867
I ordered 12 gross from my supplier
in Germany.

14:44.567 --> 14:47.834
Everything's getting out of east Berlin
except my fire engines.

14:48.867 --> 14:53.300
-They only got here last night.
-Come on, you've been down before.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.467
That's the nature of your business.

14:55.533 --> 15:00.500
Why don't you go home and enjoy Christmas,
and face the future tomorrow?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.600
-I can't.
-Why not?

15:02.667 --> 15:05.667
-Katherine threw me out.
-Your wife threw you out?

15:05.734 --> 15:07.867
I had no idea she was that bright.

15:11.266 --> 15:14.300
-What happened?
-Katherine accused me of infidelity.

15:14.367 --> 15:16.266
Oh, damn it, Stan.

15:16.333 --> 15:21.333
This makes those infidelities during our
marriage seem much less special.

15:22.867 --> 15:27.266
Why did this have to happen to me?
Broke and homeless on Christmas.

15:27.333 --> 15:30.066
-Why me?
-Why you? Why them?

15:30.133 --> 15:33.000
Look around you.
You're not exactly alone.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.233
This is probably the only Christmas
they'll have.

15:36.300 --> 15:40.066
Think about that. It might take your mind
off your self-pity.

15:40.133 --> 15:41.633
I've got to go back to work.

15:45.066 --> 15:46.700
Mrs. Sensitive.

15:48.133 --> 15:51.133
(serene music playing)

15:52.266 --> 15:56.100
You know, being here reminds me
of my favorite Christmas in 1951,

15:56.166 --> 15:57.800
which I spent at the USO...

15:58.233 --> 16:01.934
making a better Christmas
for our boys getting ready to go to Korea.

16:02.433 --> 16:06.900
I gave those servicemen something even
Mr. Bob Hope himself couldn't give them.

16:09.567 --> 16:10.700
A rash?

16:15.033 --> 16:16.967
Doughnuts, Dorothy.

16:17.033 --> 16:19.367
Big daddy was part owner
of a doughnut shop.

16:19.967 --> 16:22.066
Did you think this would be
a story about sex?

16:22.133 --> 16:26.066
This is a beautiful Christmas story.
That really hurts me.

16:26.133 --> 16:27.800
I'm sorry, Blanche.

16:28.667 --> 16:32.333
Well, anyway, after the boys
had their doughnut,

16:32.400 --> 16:36.700
actually, at this point, it does change
more into a veteran's day story.

16:39.533 --> 16:42.567
What happened to Dorothy's ex-husband
is not that uncommon.

16:42.633 --> 16:46.533
-Really?
-Many people are only a few paychecks away

16:46.600 --> 16:49.667
from being homeless.
The suddenly poor are everywhere.

16:49.934 --> 16:52.467
Once knocked down, it's hard to recover.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.800
-What's going to happen to these people?
-I don't know.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.900
Housing isn't affordable,
rents keep going up,

16:58.967 --> 17:02.600
-minimum wage has been held down.
-Seems so unfair.

17:02.667 --> 17:07.100
It is. There are 3 million homeless
people in this country.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.900
They're being fed today
because it's Christmas,

17:10.967 --> 17:12.700
but where do they eat tomorrow?

17:13.166 --> 17:16.266
When the great communicator
talked about a city on a hill,

17:16.333 --> 17:19.767
I wonder if it included
people sleeping on gratings.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.000
Dorothy, Stan's out there
feeling so sorry for himself,

17:26.066 --> 17:28.233
he's bringing down the homeless.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.100
-Blanche, take over for me.
-What are you going to do?

17:33.166 --> 17:37.667
-Try to make Stan feel like a whole man.
-Anything you need?

17:37.734 --> 17:39.133
Yes. Half a man.

17:43.600 --> 17:48.166
Sophia, you were just putting me on
about those eels, right?

17:48.233 --> 17:53.333
In Sicily it wouldn't be Christmas
without a plate of eels and larks.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.266
Larks? Larks aren't eating birds.
They're singing birds.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.133
They don't sing long in Sicily.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.367
-Stanley?
-Yeah?

18:08.967 --> 18:11.100
I forgot to wish you a Merry Christmas.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.467
-Some Christmas.
-Oh, come on, Stanley.

18:13.533 --> 18:16.834
-You're the most fortunate person here.
-Big deal.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.967
You've always been able to turn
bad holidays around.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.367
Do you remember the Christmas
we were so broke

18:23.433 --> 18:27.400
that you convinced the kids Christmas
was the 26th?

18:27.667 --> 18:30.767
You got somebody's Christmas tree
from the garbage.

18:31.033 --> 18:34.166
You trimmed it with gum wrappers
and pull tabs.

18:34.233 --> 18:38.233
On television they were playing
<i>Jim Thorpe, all-American.</i>

18:38.300 --> 18:42.400
-You told the kids it was <i>King of Kings.</i>
-They believed it, too.

18:42.467 --> 18:45.734
Right up to the part where Jesus had his
Olympic medals taken away

18:45.800 --> 18:47.600
for playing professional baseball.

18:49.333 --> 18:54.600
-That became a tradition with us.
-You had ingenuity then.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.133
You didn't let anything beat you.
You can do it again, Stan,

18:58.200 --> 19:02.266
if you just work hard
and turn on that Zbornak charm.

19:02.867 --> 19:06.200
-I'm good at that.
-You could charm the pants off anybody.

19:06.266 --> 19:09.834
I have to believe that.
Otherwise, I was... easy.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.533
It's different this time.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.533
I've scraped the bottom
of the barrel before.

19:16.600 --> 19:21.033
-Now I don't even have a barrel.
-Stan, stop whining. It's pathetic.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.133
That's the only way to whine.

19:24.233 --> 19:27.734
All I need is a few bucks,
just a little seed money.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.800
Here, Stan. Take it.

19:30.233 --> 19:33.166
Atta girl. To show I love you,
I won't count it.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.033
I hate you, Stanley. You are the lowest.

19:38.100 --> 19:41.100
I'm sorry if I'm not the man
you divorced.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.934
-So am I.
-I'd love to be belittled, but--

19:44.000 --> 19:46.934
Fine, fine. You've eaten.
Go somewhere else and wallow.

19:48.767 --> 19:52.600
-Careful. You're not my only ex-wife.
-Then why bother me?

19:52.667 --> 19:54.333
You're the only one who answers the door.

19:57.734 --> 20:02.500
(serene music playing)

20:02.567 --> 20:04.700
♪ <i>Fa, la, la, la, la</i> ♪

20:04.767 --> 20:07.800
♪ <i>La, la, la, la</i> ♪

20:12.266 --> 20:14.867
That does it. All the food's gone.

20:14.934 --> 20:18.533
Except the fruitcake,
there's more now than when we started.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.433
I wish there was more
we could do for them.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.500
-Especially the children.
-I know.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.734
I'm supposed to look after
their spiritual needs,

20:29.800 --> 20:34.033
but they have other needs
that are more pressing.

20:35.667 --> 20:40.033
Thank you for coming.
I wish you every blessing for next year.

20:40.100 --> 20:44.233
Merry Christmas! Ho ho ho!

20:44.300 --> 20:48.367
Here's Santa with toys
for all the good boys and girls.

20:49.867 --> 20:52.066
Have you all been good boys and girls?

20:52.133 --> 20:54.633
-(kids) Yeah!
-Aha!

20:56.266 --> 20:58.200
Ho ho ho!

20:59.934 --> 21:02.500
Ho ho ho ho ho!

21:02.567 --> 21:06.734
-I'm proud of you, Stan. I'm proud.
-That was lovely.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.100
You made me believe
in Santa Claus again.

21:09.166 --> 21:13.200
-Me, too.
-Not me. I knew it was Stan all along.

21:15.934 --> 21:20.533
After walking out of here,
I realized I'm more fortunate than many.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.567
Tomorrow, I'm going
to get the jump on Easter.

21:22.633 --> 21:27.500
I've got an idea for a great novelty,
an Easter egg with a window.

21:27.567 --> 21:32.233
-Inside's a beautiful Easter scene.
-That's not a new idea.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.100
Those Easter eggs
have been around for years.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.333
Yes, but this leaves
a black circle around your eyes.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.333
That practically screams Easter.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.066
And, you know, Dorothy,
I apologized to my wife.

21:46.133 --> 21:48.500
She's letting me come back.

21:48.567 --> 21:52.567
Great. Then you can give me
back the $60.

21:53.033 --> 21:56.700
-Well, I apologized with flowers.
-$60 worth?

21:57.333 --> 22:01.000
Dorothy, I may be a lot of things,
but I'm not cheap.

22:04.934 --> 22:07.133
Actually, this is one
of the best Christmases

22:07.200 --> 22:10.066
-I've ever spent with Stan.
-It was pretty nice.

22:10.133 --> 22:14.200
I can't remember feeling this proud
of myself so early in the evening.

22:16.767 --> 22:20.133
-We did good.
-I wish we could do more.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.266
So do I.

22:21.333 --> 22:25.400
We have a place to go home to. Many don't.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.400
We should keep them
in our hearts and minds,

22:28.467 --> 22:31.800
not just on Christmas,
but every day of the year.

22:32.266 --> 22:35.300
It's more than a place to go.
It's having someone there for you.

22:35.367 --> 22:40.066
-We have each other.
-That's right, darling.

22:40.667 --> 22:41.667
So let's go home.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.166
Thanks, girls,
for coming down and helping out.

22:45.233 --> 22:48.667
-Thanks for having us.
-I'm glad you asked.

22:48.734 --> 22:51.066
And, hey, merry Christmas.

22:51.133 --> 22:55.233
-Oh, merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

23:00.066 --> 23:03.333
