WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.635
CALLS WERE MADE.
 SWEETIE, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:04.635 --> 00:07.378
I DON'T WANNA TELL YOU.
 AND IF PORTER
DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR COURT,

00:07.378 --> 00:09.080
WE'RE GONNA LOSE
OUR RESTAURANT!

00:09.080 --> 00:10.641
A GUY THREATENS
TO KILL YOUR SON,

00:10.641 --> 00:12.713
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

00:12.713 --> 00:16.087
AND AS ONE LOVE AFFAIR
BLOSSOMED, ANOTHER...

00:16.087 --> 00:18.319
YOU WERE MARRIED BEFORE?
 SHE'S DEAD.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.192
I WANT YOU
OUT OF MY HOUSE.
 WITHERED ON THE VINE.

00:21.192 --> 00:24.725
MIKE DELFINO HAS TO PAY
FOR TAKING YOU AWAY FROM ME.

00:24.725 --> 00:28.028
I WANT HIM TO LOSE WHAT I LOST.

00:33.504 --> 00:35.806
(Mary Alice)
IT HAD BEEN A LONG JOURNEY

00:35.806 --> 00:37.508
FOR DAVID WILLIAMS,

00:37.508 --> 00:39.510
AND THOUGH IT BEGAN YEARS AGO,

00:39.510 --> 00:43.214
HE REMEMBERED
EVERY STEP OF IT...

00:43.214 --> 00:47.047
WALKING OUTSIDE HIS FRONT DOOR

00:47.047 --> 00:51.522
TO FIND A POLICEMAN
WITH NEWS OF A CAR CRASH...

00:51.522 --> 00:54.455
RUNNING INTO THE HOSPITAL

00:54.455 --> 00:56.157
ONLY TO BE TOLD

00:56.157 --> 01:00.161
HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER
HAD DIED...

01:00.161 --> 01:02.363
(Dave) NO! NO! LET GO OF ME!
(screaming)

01:02.363 --> 01:04.364
BEING DRAGGED
INTO A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY

01:04.364 --> 01:06.197
AFTER HIS MENTAL BREAKDOWN.

01:06.197 --> 01:07.538
NO!

01:07.538 --> 01:12.473
STROLLING INTO A HOTEL
WEEKS AFTER BEING RELEASED

01:12.473 --> 01:16.747
AND BUMPING
INTO A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE...

01:16.747 --> 01:19.210
MARCHING DOWN THE AISLE

01:19.210 --> 01:21.152
WITH A WOMAN
WHO, AS IT TURNED OUT,

01:21.152 --> 01:23.114
ONCE LIVED ON THE SAME STREET

01:23.114 --> 01:26.457
WITH THE MAN
WHO HAD KILLED HIS FAMILY.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.193
BUT HIS BRIDE WAS NOW UNHAPPY,

01:32.193 --> 01:34.195
AND DAVE WILLIAMS WAS WORRIED

01:34.195 --> 01:37.628
THAT HIS DREAM OF REVENGE
HAD BEEN DESTROYED.

01:37.628 --> 01:41.302
LUCKILY FOR DAVE,

01:41.302 --> 01:44.435
FATE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE
SOME STEPS OF ITS OWN.

01:44.435 --> 01:46.137
HEY, DAVE!

01:46.137 --> 01:48.139
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:48.139 --> 01:50.581
EDIE AND I HAD A FIGHT.
(sighs)

01:50.581 --> 01:53.884
I TAKE IT YOU'RE GIVING HER
TIME TO CALM DOWN?

01:53.884 --> 01:56.887
NO, I THINK I'M LOOKING
FOR A PLACE TO STAY

01:56.887 --> 01:58.889
WHILE SHE'S LOOKING
FOR A LAWYER.

01:58.889 --> 02:00.721
OH, MAN, I... (sighs)

02:00.721 --> 02:03.724
WANNA SAY SOMETHING HELPFUL,
BUT ALL I GOT IS "THAT SUCKS."

02:03.724 --> 02:06.227
THAT IT DOES.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.229
SO WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

02:08.229 --> 02:10.231
OH, IT'S SUCH A NICE NIGHT,

02:10.231 --> 02:13.133
I THOUGHT I'D WALK TO
THAT MOTEL ON THE INTERSTATE.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.207
MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY THE STARS
WHILE MY LIFE FALLS APART.

02:16.207 --> 02:17.538
WELL...

02:17.538 --> 02:20.641
IT'S GETTING LATE,
AND SO, UH...

02:20.641 --> 02:23.574
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
STAY WITH ME?

02:27.218 --> 02:28.349
REALLY?

02:28.349 --> 02:31.452
I, UH...
I WOULDN'T WANT TO IMPOSE.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.884
DAVE, YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

02:33.884 --> 02:35.886
(chuckles) I OWE YA.

02:37.828 --> 02:41.432
WELL, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
I GUESS YOU DO. (chuckles)

02:44.465 --> 02:46.497
COME ON IN.

02:46.497 --> 02:48.239
AND JUST LIKE THAT,

02:48.239 --> 02:50.871
DAVE'S DREAM OF REVENGE
WAS SALVAGED...

02:50.871 --> 02:53.504
LEAD THE WAY, ROOMIE.

02:53.504 --> 02:55.506
AND HE HAD A FEELING

02:55.506 --> 03:09.320
HIS LONG JOURNEY
WAS ALMOST OVER.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.292
AT 9:02 THE NEXT MORNING...

03:11.292 --> 03:12.623
(sniffles)

03:12.623 --> 03:15.195
EDIE BRITT
BEGAN CALLING HER FRIENDS

03:15.195 --> 03:16.697
TO LET THEM KNOW

03:16.697 --> 03:20.200
SOMETHING HUMILIATING
HAD HAPPENED TO HER.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.535
BY 9:08, HER FRIENDS
HAD BEGUN TO ARRIVE,

03:24.535 --> 03:28.509
JUST SO THEY COULD HEAR
THE JUICY DETAILS.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.711
SO HE WAS MARRIED BEFORE.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.213
YOU DON'T KICK A MAN OUT
FOR THAT.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.715
(blows nose) NO.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.319
(sniffles) BUT YOU DO
 FOR NEVER MENTIONING IT.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.392
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN
I LAID OUT MY ENTIRE PAST.

03:41.392 --> 03:42.923
EMPHASIS ON THE WORD "LAID."

03:42.923 --> 03:45.826
(sighs) OH. EXACTLY.
GABY GETS IT.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.828
WELL, MAYBE THEY WERE
ONLY TOGETHER A SHORT TIME,

03:47.828 --> 03:49.830
AND SHE DIDN'T MEAN
 ANYTHING TO HIM.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.903
I DOUBT IT, SINCE HE WALKS
AROUND MUTTERING TO HER GHOST.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.637
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
LIFT YOUR SPIRITS?

03:56.637 --> 04:00.010
WE SHOULD ALL DO
A SPA WEEKEND.
 YEAH! LET'S DO THAT.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.273
OH, I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

04:02.273 --> 04:05.646
BUT I THINK I'M BETTER OFF
GETTING LOST IN MY WORK.

04:05.646 --> 04:09.950
WELL, MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU.
THINK YOU CAN RENT MY HOUSE OUT?

04:09.950 --> 04:12.453
WHAT?

04:12.453 --> 04:15.456
JACKSON GOT A TEACHING JOB
AT THE COLLEGE IN RIVERTON,

04:15.456 --> 04:17.628
AND...

04:17.628 --> 04:20.361
I'M GOING WITH HIM.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.992
UH, WAIT, YOU'RE MOVING?

04:21.992 --> 04:24.995
I KNOW IT'S SUDDEN, BUT I FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS.

04:24.995 --> 04:26.997
AND IT'S ONLY
TWO HOURS AWAY,

04:26.997 --> 04:29.570
SO IT'LL STILL BE LIKE
WE'RE PRACTICALLY NEXT DOOR.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.703
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU,
BUT WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU.

04:32.703 --> 04:36.377
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT US.
JACKSON IS SO GREAT.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.580
YOU ARE MAKING
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.812
ABSOLUTELY.
COME HERE, YOU!
 AW!

04:41.812 --> 04:43.514
(laughs)
 (Lynette) AW!

04:45.386 --> 04:47.017
(laughter)

04:47.017 --> 04:49.990
(Gabrielle) I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE LEAVING.
 (Lynette) I KNOW!

04:49.990 --> 04:53.063
(motor turns off)

04:53.063 --> 04:54.765
HEY, DAVE.

04:54.765 --> 04:57.998
HEY!
 WHEN YOU'RE DONE HERE,
YOU WANNA COME DO MY LAWN?

04:57.998 --> 05:00.030
WELL, I FIGURE SINCE MIKE'S
LETTING ME CRASH HERE,

05:00.030 --> 05:03.934
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.
 WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE...

05:03.934 --> 05:07.378
AND BRAVE. MIKE TAKES
A LOT OF PRIDE IN HIS YARD.

05:07.378 --> 05:08.909
YEAH.
 LOOK AT HIS ROSES.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.782
EVERY TIME I WALK BY HERE,
I JUST WANT TO STEAL ONE.

05:11.782 --> 05:14.815
HERE, LET ME CUT YOU ONE.
 OH, NO. MNH-MNH. COULDN'T.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.547
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

05:16.547 --> 05:19.550
HEY, YOU. WHAT'S UP?

05:19.550 --> 05:21.051
NOT MUCH.

05:21.051 --> 05:23.053
GOT A CALL FROM DYLAN.

05:23.053 --> 05:25.325
HER HUSBAND'S TRAVELING MORE
FOR HIS BUSINESS,

05:25.325 --> 05:28.328
AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANYBODY
TO HELP HER WITH THE BABY.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.562
SHE'S TRYING TO PUSH ME
TO MOVE OUT TO BALTIMORE.

05:31.562 --> 05:33.804
SO, UH, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

05:33.804 --> 05:36.567
OH, JUST THAT
I'D THINK ABOUT IT.

05:36.567 --> 05:39.069
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

05:39.069 --> 05:41.071
WELL, SHE REALLY NEEDS
YOUR HELP.

05:41.071 --> 05:43.814
I GUESS
YOU SHOULD HELP HER.

05:43.814 --> 05:45.816
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE NEEDS IT.

05:45.816 --> 05:48.779
HONESTLY?
I THINK SHE'S JUST LONELY.

05:48.779 --> 05:49.920
(chuckles nervously)

05:49.920 --> 05:53.854
OF COURSE... IT WOULD BE NICE
TO BE CLOSER.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.427
BUT IS THAT
A GOOD ENOUGH REASON

05:56.427 --> 06:00.461
TO UPROOT
MY WHOLE LIFE HERE?

06:00.461 --> 06:02.463
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:02.463 --> 06:04.535
(sighs)

06:04.535 --> 06:07.568
I'M NOT SURE.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.570
I KNOW. I JUST...

06:09.570 --> 06:11.572
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE AN OPINION.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.604
(telephone ringing)

06:13.604 --> 06:16.607
OH, SHOOT. I'M, UH, EXPECTING
A CALL FROM A SUPPLIER.

06:16.607 --> 06:19.109
I'LL, UH,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.522
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

06:31.522 --> 06:34.024
I'M SURE HE WON'T EVEN
NOTICE IT'S GONE.

06:37.568 --> 06:39.570
OF COURSE,
THIS NEW LANDSCAPING

06:39.570 --> 06:41.572
WILL REQUIRE
AN UPDATED IRRIGATION SYSTEM,

06:41.572 --> 06:45.075
WHICH I'M HAPPY
TO TAKE CARE OF.
 BREE, YOU BOUGHT US A HOUSE.

06:45.075 --> 06:49.009
WE CAN'T LET YOU
DO ALL THIS, TOO.
 NONSENSE!
IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

06:49.009 --> 06:52.012
TO MAKE YOUR HOME
MORE BEAUTIFUL. I INSIST.
 (Orson) YES!

06:52.012 --> 06:54.485
IT'S GONNA BE HERE TOMORROW.
WHOO-HOO!

06:54.485 --> 06:56.547
ORSON, TAKE IT EASY!
 (laughs)

06:56.547 --> 06:59.049
IMPOSSIBLE.
SOON, I, THE GRILLMASTER,

06:59.049 --> 07:01.622
WILL CHRISTEN
A BRAND-NEW BARBECUE.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.624
YOU'RE PRETTY EXCITED
ABOUT A GRILL.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.126
OH, IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT,
YOUNG MAN.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.599
THIS IS
THE PRAIRIEFIRE TURBO.

07:08.599 --> 07:12.102
IT'S 122,000 BTUs
OF CHARBROILING POWER.

07:12.102 --> 07:14.805
LOOK OUT, CATTLE!
 YOU THINK YOU'RE EXCITED?

07:14.805 --> 07:17.067
JUST IMAGINE THE SALESMAN
WHO OVERCHARGED YOU.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.210
WELL, BREE,
I GOT A VERY GOOD DEAL.

07:20.210 --> 07:23.213
HE ONLY THINKS HE GOT
A GOOD DEAL BECAUSE THE SALESMAN

07:23.213 --> 07:26.817
THREW IN ONE OF THOSE
"KISS THE COOK" HATS.

07:26.817 --> 07:28.749
AND THE TEMPERATURE-SENSING
BARBECUE FORK.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.651
WELL, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
 YEAH.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.222
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM!

07:32.222 --> 07:34.985
ORSON IS
A HORRIBLE NEGOTIATOR.

07:34.985 --> 07:37.488
HE'S NEVER MET A STICKER PRICE
HE DIDN'T LIKE.

07:37.488 --> 07:38.989
OH, NO, BREE, THAT'S--
 IT'S TRUE.

07:38.989 --> 07:40.991
THERE'S A REASON
THE LOCAL CAR DEALERS

07:40.991 --> 07:44.064
SEND YOU A FRUIT BASKET
EVERY CHRISTMAS.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.136
NOW HUSH.
 (muffled) MM. (chuckles)

07:46.136 --> 07:49.239
BREE, COULD YOU PLEASE
NOT DO THAT?

07:49.239 --> 07:51.471
DO... DO WHAT?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.474
IT'S JUST... WHEN YOU TALK
TO YOUR HUSBAND THAT WAY,

07:54.474 --> 07:57.007
IT REALLY
PUSHES A BUTTON FOR ME.

07:57.007 --> 07:59.980
MY MOM USED TO DO THAT,
AND IT, UH...

07:59.980 --> 08:02.553
DROVE MY DAD AWAY.

08:02.553 --> 08:06.086
I THINK HE WAS TIRED
OF BEING EMASCULATED.

08:09.019 --> 08:12.492
DID I MENTION IT HAS
A REAR-MOUNTED ROTISSERIE RACK?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.895
(scoffs) WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SAYING, ALEX?

08:14.895 --> 08:18.198
I'M SAYING, IF YOU'RE GONNA
BE RUDE TO YOUR HUSBAND,

08:18.198 --> 08:22.032
COULD YOU JUST
NOT DO IT IN FRONT OF ME?

08:25.876 --> 08:27.237
SO ROTISSERIE, HUH?

08:27.237 --> 08:30.180
YEAH. GOOD FOR CHICKEN,
UH...

08:30.180 --> 08:32.743
ROLLED ROASTS, LEGS OF LAMB.

08:32.743 --> 08:36.145
THIS THING IS SO ADVANCED...

08:36.145 --> 08:38.118
(crying)
 (crying)

08:38.118 --> 08:41.150
I'M SORRY.
DADDY HAS TO WORK.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.994
CARLOS, WHAT IS GOING ON?
YOU'RE GONNA MISS YOUR PLANE.

08:43.994 --> 08:47.858
THEY'RE UPSET. THEY'RE NOT
USED TO ME BEING AWAY.
 OH, FOR GOD SAKES, GIRLS.
IT'S NOT LIKE

08:47.858 --> 08:50.861
HE'S GOING OFF TO WAR.
HE'S GONNA BE BACK TOMORROW.

08:50.861 --> 08:53.904
WHY CAN'T DADDY
WORK HERE?

08:53.904 --> 08:55.906
BECAUSE DADDY
HAS A NEW JOB

08:55.906 --> 08:59.539
THAT'S GONNA MAKE US
LOTS OF MONEY.
 WE DON'T NEED LOTS OF MONEY.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.713
HEY, WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE?

09:04.274 --> 09:06.116
LOOK, GIRLS...

09:06.116 --> 09:09.149
DADDY'S GONNA BE HOME TOMORROW
IN TIME FOR DINNER.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.582
YOU CAN CALL ME
WHENEVER YOU WANT. OKAY?

09:11.582 --> 09:12.953
UH-HUH.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.955
AND THE BEST PART IS

09:14.955 --> 09:17.788
YOU GET TO SPEND A WHOLE DAY
WITH JUST MOMMY!

09:22.593 --> 09:24.164
(chuckles)

09:26.096 --> 09:29.099
OH, HELLO, MR. FISHMAN.

09:29.099 --> 09:31.872
I'M COMING IN.
WATCH THE WHEELS.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.975
BOY, YOU JUST HAD
TO PUT A RUG HERE, DIDN'T YOU?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.107
UH, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

09:37.107 --> 09:39.910
IT'S ABOUT YOUR DAMN SON.

09:39.910 --> 09:42.653
PORTER?
 HOW THE HELL DO I KNOW?

09:42.653 --> 09:46.156
HE'S GOT RED HAIR AND HE'S GOT
A FACE YOU JUST WANNA SLAP,

09:46.156 --> 09:48.789
AND HE'S DRIVING MY SISTER
CRAZY!

09:48.789 --> 09:51.291
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 THE RETIREMENT HOME.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.324
YOUR KID HAS BEEN STAYING
IN YOUR MOM'S ROOM.

09:54.324 --> 09:57.798
WHAT?!
 MURIEL THOUGHT
HE WAS JUST VISITING,

09:57.798 --> 10:00.270
BUT HE'S BEEN THERE
FOR A WEEK.

10:00.270 --> 10:01.972
OH!

10:04.034 --> 10:06.737
NOW THE RULES CLEARLY STATE...
 (dialing)

10:06.737 --> 10:08.739
NO VISITING AFTER DARK.

10:08.739 --> 10:12.112
TOM, I KNOW WHERE PORTER IS.
HE'S HIDING AT MY MOTHER'S.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.285
OH, HIDING, MY ASS. HE'S NOT
HIDING. HE'S LIVING THERE.

10:15.285 --> 10:17.988
HE EVEN STOLE
MY SISTER'S ORANGE JUICE.

10:17.988 --> 10:19.990
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
THANK YOU.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.993
CALL BOB. TELL HIM WE CAN
MAKE THE HEARING TOMORROW.

10:22.993 --> 10:24.655
NOBODY CAN SLEEP THERE

10:24.655 --> 10:26.626
BECAUSE HE'S GOT THAT TV
BLARING ALL NIGHT LONG.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.259
LOOK, TOM, I CAN'T TALK NOW.
JUST CALL BOB.

10:29.259 --> 10:31.261
I'M GOING OVER THERE NOW.
OKAY. BYE.

10:31.261 --> 10:33.964
PARKER, I'M GONNA BE BACK
IN AN HOUR.

10:33.964 --> 10:36.266
MR. FISHMAN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.041
(front door closes)

10:41.041 --> 10:45.045
WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
MAKE ME A SANDWICH!

10:47.277 --> 10:48.418
HMM.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.652
UH, ONE MORE THING.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
COULD YOU SEE ABOUT HAVING
THE BASEMENT CLEARED OUT?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.656
YEAH, THE LAST TIME
WE WENT DOWN THERE,

10:56.656 --> 10:59.659
IT WAS FILLED
WITH MILDEWED BOXES.
 OH, I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.732
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN HAVING OLD JUNK AROUND.

COME BY AND GRAB IT
AT YOUR CONVENIENCE.

11:32.022 --> 11:33.964
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.298
I ASKED EVERYONE OVER
THIS MORNING

11:38.298 --> 11:41.001
BECAUSE I HAD
THIS HUGE THING TO SHARE

11:41.001 --> 11:43.303
ABOUT KICKING MY HUSBAND OUT,
AND YOU PRANCE IN

19:21.331 --> 19:24.294

19:26.296 --> 19:28.438

I KNOW. IT'S HARD TO LOOK
IN THE MIRROR.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.406

IN YOUR MIRROR, EDIE?

19:36.406 --> 19:38.808

OF MEN YOU'VE CONQUERED.

19:38.808 --> 19:40.280
THANK YOU.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.312
IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT,

OVER A THOUSAND MEN?

19:50.320 --> 19:52.262
OKAY, THAT'S TRUE.
I ENJOYED THE '80s.

19:52.262 --> 19:54.364

19:54.364 --> 19:56.266
I GO AFTER MEN
BECAUSE I WANT THEM.

19:56.266 --> 19:58.468
YOU GO AFTER THEM
BECAUSE YOU NEED THEM.

19:58.468 --> 20:01.401
THAT IS NOT
MUCH OF A DISTINCTION.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.403
YES, IT IS.

LYNETTE, YOU'RE REALLY UPSET.
JUST HANG UP AND COME HOME.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.361
SHE'S SO ANGRY AT ME.

21:00.430 --> 21:02.992

DOES THAT MEAN SHE'S DEAD?

21:02.992 --> 21:04.534
NO.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.396
NO.

21:06.396 --> 21:08.398

DRIVING HOME LAST NIGHT,

21:18.848 --> 21:21.581

ON THE PHONE,

21:21.581 --> 21:24.584
AND TWO CARS IN FRONT OF ME
HAD AN ACCIDENT.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.586
AND I THOUGHT,
DAMN, THAT COULD BE ME.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.759
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
THAT COULD BE ME.

21:29.759 --> 21:33.062

OUT OF ME.
 WE ARE SORRY,
BUT WE HAD TO GET YOU BACK.

21:33.062 --> 21:35.365
YOU'VE GOTTA BE IN COURT
BY 5:00.
 NO! I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO JAIL.

21:35.365 --> 21:37.367
PORTER, LISTEN TO ME.
BOB TALKED TO THE JUDGE.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.929
HE THINKS HE CAN GET THEM
TO DROP THE CHARGES.

21:39.929 --> 21:42.432
I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD BELIEVE YOU.

21:42.432 --> 21:45.805
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO.

21:51.541 --> 21:52.882
OKAY.

21:52.882 --> 21:55.585
(Tom) GREAT.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

21:55.585 --> 21:58.848
THAT WAS A ROTTEN YOU DID,
LYNETTE.

22:01.351 --> 22:04.394
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

22:04.394 --> 22:07.326
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT CAN I TELL YA?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.859
I LEARNED FROM THE BEST.

22:14.404 --> 22:15.535
(scoffs)

22:15.535 --> 22:17.407
CELIA! JUANITA!

22:17.407 --> 22:20.670
I AM NOT GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN
TO PICK UP THESE CLOTHES!

22:20.670 --> 22:22.972
YOU'VE GOT
TILL THE COUNT OF THREE!

22:22.972 --> 22:24.814
ONE...

22:24.814 --> 22:27.477
TWO...

22:27.477 --> 22:28.948
THREE!

22:30.650 --> 22:32.682
YOU CAN HEAR ME, RIGHT?

22:32.682 --> 22:34.123
(Juanita and Celia) YEAH!

22:34.123 --> 22:36.826
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!
I'M CALLING YOUR FATHER!

22:36.826 --> 22:38.388
WHOO!

22:38.388 --> 22:41.060
YOU ARE GONNA GET IT NOW!

22:41.060 --> 22:44.494
HE IS GONNA TEAR INTO YOU!
IT IS GONNA BE A BLOODBATH!

22:44.494 --> 22:46.496
(cell phone rings)

22:46.496 --> 22:47.467
I...

22:47.467 --> 22:48.838
(ring)

22:48.838 --> 22:50.500
HEY, BABE. WHAT'S UP?

22:50.500 --> 22:52.872
IT'S YOUR CHILDREN.
THEY'VE RUN AMOK.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.405
WHAT?
 NOW THAT YOU'VE
GONE BACK TO WORK,

22:55.405 --> 22:57.407
THEY WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

22:57.407 --> 22:59.849
THEY KNOW YOU'RE NOT IN THE NEXT
ROOM, READY TO DROP THE HAMMER.

22:59.849 --> 23:02.912
Help me!
 HOW? I'M IN A MEETING.

23:02.912 --> 23:05.084
O-OKAY. I'M GONNA
PUT YOU ON SPEAKER,

23:05.084 --> 23:08.818
AND I WANT YOU
TO RIP 'EM A NEW ONE.
 I'M WITH CLIENTS.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

23:08.818 --> 23:12.091
BUT--
 I GOTTA GO!

23:12.091 --> 23:14.724
CARLOS? CARLOS!

23:14.724 --> 23:16.726
(Juanita)
I think he hung up, Mommy.

23:16.726 --> 23:18.728
Can you bring us a lemonade?

23:18.728 --> 23:20.500
(scoffs)

23:22.101 --> 23:23.773
(Bree) HELLO, MIKE.

23:23.773 --> 23:26.405
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.
 WHERE'S KATHERINE?

23:26.405 --> 23:29.138
AH, HEADACHE.
SHE SENDS HER REGRETS.
 OH

23:29.138 --> 23:33.082
YOU MIND IF I GRAB A BEER?
 UH, YEAH. IN THE TEST KITCHEN.

23:33.082 --> 23:37.787
UH, BEER SOUNDS GOOD. I THINK
I'LL GRAB ONE, TOO. EXCUSE ME.

23:41.751 --> 23:44.454
SO... KATHERINE
NOT FEELING WELL, HUH?

23:44.454 --> 23:46.526
YEAH.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.428
YEAH, I THINK SHE ALSO MIGHT BE
A LITTLE MIFFED WITH ME.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.461
(bottle fizzes)

23:51.461 --> 23:53.633
THIS ABOUT BALTIMORE?

23:53.633 --> 23:54.864
(sighs)

23:54.864 --> 23:57.907
IT'S NOT THAT I WANT HER TO GO,
'CAUSE I DON'T.

23:59.809 --> 24:02.441
THEY WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER?

24:02.441 --> 24:04.443
I DON'T WANNA BE THE GUY

24:04.443 --> 24:06.816
THAT COMES BETWEEN
HER AND HER DAUGHTER,

24:06.816 --> 24:08.818
NOT TO MENTION
A GRANDCHILD.

24:08.818 --> 24:10.149
OHH.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.852
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
BECAUSE...

24:12.852 --> 24:14.524
I DON'T KNOW.

24:14.524 --> 24:17.026
MAYBE YOU'RE STILL HUNG UP
ON YOUR EX-WIFE.

24:17.026 --> 24:18.457
SUSAN?

24:18.457 --> 24:22.231
NO. NO, THAT'S OVER.

24:22.231 --> 24:25.094
YOU SURE?

24:25.094 --> 24:27.597
AND MOST GUYS I TALK TO,

24:27.597 --> 24:30.640
THEY SAY THEY ONLY REALLY
FALL IN LOVE ONCE.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.202
AND EVEN IF
IT DOESN'T WORK,

24:33.202 --> 24:35.204
THEY SPEND
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES

24:35.204 --> 24:38.207
THINKING ABOUT
THE ONE THAT THEY LOST.
 (uncaps beer, bottle fizzes)

24:38.207 --> 24:41.480
I ALWAYS WONDERED IF
THAT'S HOW YOU FELT ABOUT SUSAN.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.853
WHY WOULD YOU WONDER
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

24:43.853 --> 24:45.555
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

24:45.555 --> 24:47.557
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

24:47.557 --> 24:49.258
(slaps back)

24:49.258 --> 24:50.990
WELL, NO.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.491
IN FACT, DAVE,

24:52.491 --> 24:56.495
I THINK I MIGHT BE
FALLING IN LOVE WITH KATHERINE.

24:58.167 --> 25:02.201
DID YOU JUST USE
THE "L" WORD?
 OH.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.835
WOW! SEE, I-I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS THAT SERIOUS.

25:05.835 --> 25:07.506
WELL, TO BE HONEST,

25:07.506 --> 25:11.140
IT DIDN'T REALLY HIT ME
UNTIL SHE SAID SHE MIGHT LEAVE.

25:18.247 --> 25:21.220
WHERE ARE OUR GUESTS?

25:21.220 --> 25:23.222
THE FOOD'S GONNA GET COLD.

25:23.222 --> 25:26.055
OH, I'LL GO FIND THEM.

25:26.055 --> 25:30.560
AND BRING SOME STEAK SAUCE.
 OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED
ANY SAUCE WITH THESE BABIES.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.562
THEY ARE SEASONED
TO PERFECTION.

25:32.562 --> 25:34.533
(lowered voice) BRING IT.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.707
WELL, THERE'S NO SENSE
IN WAITING. DIG IN.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.575
OH, DEAR.
ARE THEY OVERCOOKED?

25:45.575 --> 25:48.578
NO, THEY'RE WELL-DONE.
THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE THEM.

25:48.578 --> 25:50.149
BREE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:50.149 --> 25:52.882
OH, I REALLY COULDN'T SAY.

25:52.882 --> 25:55.324
YOU COULDN'T SAY
IF YOUR MEAT IS OVERCOOKED?

25:55.324 --> 25:59.659
NO. I WOULDN'T WANT
TO UPSET ANYONE.

26:01.330 --> 26:03.593
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
YOU WON'T UPSET ME.

26:05.564 --> 26:09.268
I DON'T THINK
SHE WAS REFERRING TO YOU.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.802
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT GRILLING
IS SUCH A MANLY PASTIME.

26:12.802 --> 26:15.304
IF I SUGGESTED
THAT ORSON SOMEHOW FAILED

26:15.304 --> 26:18.047
TO PRODUCE
THE PERFECT STEAK,

26:18.047 --> 26:21.010
YOU MIGHT SEE IT AS ANOTHER
EXAMPLE OF EMASCULATION.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.983
I SEE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT GO, ARE YOU?

26:23.983 --> 26:25.985
WELL, FOR ALL I KNOW,

26:25.985 --> 26:28.317
TELLING ORSON HIS STEAK
TASTES LIKE CHARCOAL

26:28.317 --> 26:30.620
MIGHT BE DEBALLING HIM.

26:30.620 --> 26:33.623
YOU KNOW, BREE, YOU CAN MAKE
YOUR POINT AND STILL BE NICE.

26:33.623 --> 26:36.125
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WOULD BE NICE, ALEX?

26:36.125 --> 26:39.028
SHOWING GRATITUDE WHEN PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN GENEROUS WITH YOU.

26:39.028 --> 26:41.030
DON'T LISTEN TO HER,
ALEX.

26:41.030 --> 26:44.173
SHE'S NOT MAD AT YOU.
SHE'S MAD AT ME... AND THE MEAT.

26:46.235 --> 26:48.908
GRATITUDE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

26:48.908 --> 26:50.910
I MEAN I BOUGHT YOU
A HOUSE.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.942
YOU'D THINK YOU'D SHOW ME
A LITTLE RESPECT.

26:52.942 --> 26:55.344
(scoffs) SERIOUSLY?
YOU'RE BRINGING UP THE HOUSE?

26:55.344 --> 26:58.347
WELL, WHY NOT? IT WAS A FAIRLY
GRAND GESTURE ON MY PART.

26:58.347 --> 27:01.390
YES, AND ONE THAT APPARENTLY
COMES WITH STRINGS.

27:01.390 --> 27:03.392
IF BY "STRINGS," YOU MEAN

27:03.392 --> 27:06.856
I WON'T LET YOU BE RUDE TO ME
IN MY OWN HOUSE, THEN YES.

27:06.856 --> 27:08.858
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:08.858 --> 27:12.702
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO DECLINE YOUR GRAND GESTURE.

27:12.702 --> 27:14.704
KEEP THE HOUSE.

27:20.670 --> 27:22.171
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:24.874 --> 27:27.246
ORSON BURNT THE STEAKS.

27:40.389 --> 27:43.893
SUSAN, HOW CAN YOU TELL
IF PICKLES HAVE BOTULISM?

27:43.893 --> 27:45.364
AH, WHAT THE HELL?

27:45.364 --> 27:48.367
I SHOOT THIS STUFF
INTO MY FOREHEAD.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.939
OH, BLECCH!

27:49.939 --> 27:51.270
FORGET IT.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.442
I'D RATHER STARVE
FOR A DAY OR TWO.

27:53.442 --> 27:55.444
BY THEN, YOU'LL BE DEAD,

27:55.444 --> 27:58.447
AND I CAN USE YOUR REMAINS
AS A SOURCE OF PROTEIN.

28:00.109 --> 28:02.381
OH, COME ON.
THAT WAS FUNNY.

28:04.253 --> 28:06.255
YOU KNOW... (sighs)

28:06.255 --> 28:09.989
MAYBE I DO FEEL INCOMPLETE
WITHOUT A MAN.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.362
BUT I... WOULDN'T TRADE PLACES
WITH YOU FOR ANYTHING.

28:13.362 --> 28:15.364
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

28:15.364 --> 28:18.297
NO, BUT I'M TRAPPED,
SO KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.300
IT'S THE WAY YOU ARE
WITH MEN--

28:21.300 --> 28:23.132
THEY'RE LIKE TISSUES.

28:23.132 --> 28:25.434
YOU USE ONE
AND THEN TOSS IT AWAY,

28:25.434 --> 28:28.137
AND THEN YOU'RE
ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

28:28.137 --> 28:30.409
AT LEAST I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING REAL.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.911
(chuckles)

28:31.911 --> 28:34.383
SO YOU THINK
THIS HAPPY ENDING CRAP

28:34.383 --> 28:36.886
THAT YOU BELIEVE IN IS REAL?

28:36.886 --> 28:39.949
PLEASE. I KNOW WHAT MEN
ARE REALLY LIKE.

28:39.949 --> 28:41.951
REALLY?

28:41.951 --> 28:45.194
WELL, WHEN I WAS 16,
MY DAD HAD AN AFFAIR

28:45.194 --> 28:47.496
WITH THIS WOMAN WHO HAD
A 10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

28:47.496 --> 28:50.229
AND ONE DAY,
HE TOLD MY MOM AND ME

28:50.229 --> 28:53.002
THAT HE WAS LEAVING US
FOR THEM.

28:53.002 --> 28:55.004
OH, MY GOD.

28:55.004 --> 28:57.266
NO TALKING.

28:57.266 --> 29:00.369
A WEEK LATER, HE COMES
TO THE HOUSE TO GET HIS STUFF,

29:00.369 --> 29:03.072
AND MY MOM DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE HIM,

29:03.072 --> 29:05.244
SO WE WENT TO THE MOVIES.

29:05.244 --> 29:09.979
NOW I HAD THIS, UH,
HORSE FIGURINE COLLECTION.

29:09.979 --> 29:11.981
PLASTIC, GLASS, CERAMIC--

29:11.981 --> 29:14.083
HUNDREDS OF THEM.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.986
ANYWAY, WE COME BACK
FROM THE MOVIES,

29:16.986 --> 29:20.289
AND ALL OF MY DAD'S STUFF
IS GONE.

29:20.289 --> 29:25.434
I GO INTO MY BEDROOM,
AND SOMETHING SEEMS DIFFERENT.

29:25.434 --> 29:30.369
AND THEN I REALIZE
ALL OF MY HORSES WERE GONE.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.305
MY MOM CALLED MY DAD
AND SCREAMED,

29:36.305 --> 29:39.308
AND ALL HE SAID WAS,
I WAS TOO OLD FOR THEM

29:39.308 --> 29:41.951
AND THAT
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S DAUGHTER

29:41.951 --> 29:45.014
WOULD APPRECIATE THEM MORE.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.090
(chuckles)

29:51.090 --> 29:54.293
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
WHAT A FUNGUS.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.465
(sniffles)

29:56.465 --> 29:59.428
OH, GOD. ARE YOU CRYING?

29:59.428 --> 30:01.100
(voice breaks) IT'S JUST...

30:01.100 --> 30:04.103
(sniffles) NOW I GET IT.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.935
GET WHAT?

30:05.935 --> 30:08.577
ALL THESE YEARS,
I HAVE JUDGED YOU,

30:08.577 --> 30:11.440
AND...
IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.312
OH, COME HERE.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.483
(sighs)

30:14.483 --> 30:18.447
YOU ARE THE WAY YOU ARE
BECAUSE OF YOUR FATHER.

30:20.349 --> 30:21.420
OW!

30:21.420 --> 30:24.093
EDIE, WHAT THE HELL?!

30:24.093 --> 30:26.095
DON'T PSYCHOANALYZE ME,
 YOU SIMP!

30:26.095 --> 30:28.958
I WAS JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW SELFISH MEN ARE.

30:28.958 --> 30:31.460
AND I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE NICE

30:31.460 --> 30:35.334
AND GIVE YOU A FREE PASS
FOR BEING SUCH A BIG SLUT!

30:35.334 --> 30:36.906
AAH! NO!

30:36.906 --> 30:39.268
AAH! AH! OH!

30:39.268 --> 30:41.140
EDIE!

30:41.140 --> 30:42.371
OKAY, GIRLS.

30:42.371 --> 30:45.374
PICK UP YOUR TOYS AND PUT 'EM
IN THE BASKET BEFORE DINNER.

30:45.374 --> 30:48.948
DINNER'S NOT
FOR TWO HOURS.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.350
(scoffs)

30:52.621 --> 30:54.123
HEY!

30:54.123 --> 30:56.625
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR CRAP.
NOW PICK UP THESE TOYS!

30:56.625 --> 30:57.957
NO!

30:57.957 --> 30:59.959
OKAY, JUANITA.
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

30:59.959 --> 31:02.031
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO DIFFICULT?

31:02.031 --> 31:05.394
WHEN DADDY ASKS YOU
TO DO SOMETHING, YOU JUST DO IT.

31:05.394 --> 31:07.967
THAT'S BECAUSE
I LOVE DADDY MORE.

31:13.402 --> 31:15.174
FINE.

31:25.915 --> 31:27.917
(sighs deeply)

31:32.421 --> 31:35.024
EVERYTHING OKAY,
MRS. SOLIS?

31:35.024 --> 31:37.196
YEAH. (chuckles)
JUST MY KIDS.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.198
THEY REALLY KNOW
HOW TO PUSH MY BUTTONS.

31:39.198 --> 31:43.402
OH, YEAH. I GOT A COUPLE
MONSTERS AT HOME, TOO.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.905
THE KEY IS, YOU GOTTA BE
THE BIGGER MONSTER.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.038
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,

31:49.038 --> 31:51.110
THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF ME.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.581
OOH, THAT'S BAD.

31:52.581 --> 31:56.085
FEAR IS THE FOUNDATION
OF ALL GOOD PARENTING.

31:56.085 --> 31:58.147
YOU GOTTA PRACTICE
YOUR BIG VOICE.

31:58.147 --> 32:00.489
(loudly)
FINISH THAT BROCCOLI NOW!

32:00.489 --> 32:02.551
(normal voice)
YOU SEE HOW THAT WORKS?

32:02.551 --> 32:05.124
YEAH. IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE.
(chuckles)

32:05.124 --> 32:06.355
WELL...

32:06.355 --> 32:11.200
HEY, YOU GOT
AN EXTRA 15 MINUTES?

32:11.200 --> 32:13.562
(loudly) DO IT!
FASTER! FASTER!

32:13.562 --> 32:14.703
FASTER!

32:14.703 --> 32:17.106
I WANNA SEE THIS PLACE SPARKLE!

32:17.106 --> 32:19.268
MOMMY...

32:19.268 --> 32:21.270
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS, GIRLS.

32:21.270 --> 32:23.272
WORD GOT OUT
THAT YOU WERE DISOBEYING,

32:23.272 --> 32:26.445
AND THEY SENT REGGIE OVER.
 WHO SENT REGGIE OVER?

32:26.445 --> 32:29.448
WELL, I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE HIM, BUT...

32:29.448 --> 32:31.450
(whispers) IT WAS YOUR DADDY.

32:33.122 --> 32:35.284
ENOUGH CHATTER. KEEP MOVING!

32:39.128 --> 32:41.130
(lowered voice)
WHEN THEY'RE DONE,

32:41.130 --> 32:43.132
YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE THEM VACUUM?

32:43.132 --> 32:45.094
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.
 NAH.

32:47.396 --> 32:49.098
GUESS.

32:49.098 --> 32:51.600
AW, COME ON, EDIE.
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.472
GUESS!

32:53.472 --> 32:55.144
JULY?

32:55.144 --> 32:56.675
WRONG. MARCH!

32:56.675 --> 32:58.477
OH! AH!

32:58.477 --> 33:01.350
MAN, YOU'RE BAD AT THIS.

33:01.350 --> 33:02.481
GUESS.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.183
(sighs deeply, gasps)

33:04.183 --> 33:06.555
OH, HEY, MRS. WILLIAMS. I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE DOWN HERE.

33:06.555 --> 33:10.389
OH, THANK GOD! WE'VE BEEN
LOCKED IN HERE ALL NIGHT.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.562
REALLY? GOOD THING I CAME BY
TO CHECK THE RAT TRAPS THEN.

33:13.562 --> 33:16.565
UGH! I'M GLAD I FORGOT
ABOUT THOSE UNTIL NOW.

33:16.565 --> 33:18.367
(sighs)

33:18.367 --> 33:19.528
UH, MAYER?

33:19.528 --> 33:21.530
I, UH, WOULD APPRECIATE IT

33:21.530 --> 33:25.704
IF YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.537
I WASN'T PLANNING TO.

33:28.537 --> 33:31.080
GOOD, BECAUSE I'LL DENY IT
IF YOU DO.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.512
I WON'T.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.414
AND...
(whispers) I'LL KILL YOU.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.187
GOOD-BYE, EDIE.

33:38.187 --> 33:42.020
(normal voice) OH, I'LL BRING
YOUR MAIL OVER WHEN I GET HOME.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.792
THANKS.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.464
HEY, MOM.

33:57.566 --> 33:59.568
I JUST CAME BY TO TELL YOU

33:59.568 --> 34:01.570
THAT THE JUDGE THREW OUT
PORTER'S CASE

34:01.570 --> 34:04.273
FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

34:05.714 --> 34:07.816
MOM...

34:07.816 --> 34:11.449
I DID NOT PUT YOU IN HERE
TO PUNISH YOU.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.482
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.824
YOU HAD A CHOICE.

34:15.824 --> 34:17.485
NO, I DIDN'T.

34:17.485 --> 34:21.260
FROM THE MOMENT GLEN DIED,
YOU WERE OUT OF CONTROL.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.762
IT'S TRUE YOU LOST
ALL THAT MONEY IN VEGAS.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.434
YOU STARTED DRINKING AGAIN.

34:25.434 --> 34:28.437
AND HOW MANY TIMES DID I GO
TO YOUR CONDO, ONLY TO FIND YOU

34:28.437 --> 34:31.540
ASLEEP ON THE SOFA
WITH A CIGARETTE IN YOUR MOUTH?

34:31.540 --> 34:33.842
NO, I WON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR BRINGING YOU HERE.

34:33.842 --> 34:36.545
I DID IT
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

34:36.545 --> 34:39.547
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
COME VISIT ME?

34:39.547 --> 34:42.110
IT'S NOT
A VERY PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.

34:42.110 --> 34:46.185
SO I YELL A LITTLE. SO I TOSS
A FEW CURSE WORDS YOUR WAY.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.485
BIG DEAL!

34:47.485 --> 34:50.289
LAST TIME I CAME,
YOU THREW PUDDING AT ME.

34:50.289 --> 34:53.322
I'M AN ANGRY OLD WOMAN, LYNETTE!
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

34:53.322 --> 34:55.524
HERE'S A THOUGHT--
STOP BEING ANGRY.

34:55.524 --> 34:56.665
HOW?

34:56.665 --> 34:59.368
I CAN'T MAKE A FRIEND
IN THIS PLACE

34:59.368 --> 35:02.501
WITHOUT HAVING THEM DROP DEAD
OF A STROKE FIVE MINUTES LATER.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.173
I-I FEEL LIKE HELL.

35:04.173 --> 35:07.336
EVERY TIME I LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
I WANNA SCREAM.

35:07.336 --> 35:10.509
MY ANGER IS ALL
I'VE GOT LEFT, BABY.

35:12.741 --> 35:16.215
IF I LET GO OF THAT, IT'S OVER.
I KNOW IT.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.517
THE BALL GAME WILL BE OVER.

35:18.517 --> 35:21.850
THE BALL GAME IS GOING TO END

35:21.850 --> 35:26.295
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

35:26.295 --> 35:30.599
I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE WITH YOU
FOR WHATEVER TIME YOU HAVE LEFT.

35:32.301 --> 35:36.535
BUT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,
THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.142
WOULD YOU COME VISIT ME
MORE OFTEN?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.144
AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK,

35:46.144 --> 35:48.477
AND SOMETIMES
I'D BRING THE KIDS.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.555
I'D LIKE THAT.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.628
YOU KNOW,
THEY TURNED OUT REALLY GOOD.

36:02.291 --> 36:05.794
HOW'D YOU LEARN HOW TO BE
SUCH A GOOD MOM?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.339
I HAVE NO IDEA.

36:14.503 --> 36:16.505
WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,

36:16.505 --> 36:19.508
WHY DON'T YOU STAY,
AND WE CAN TALK A WHILE?
 OKAY.

36:19.508 --> 36:22.551
I--AND GET MY FLASK
OUT OF THE DRAWER.

36:22.551 --> 36:26.755
HEY, I CAN'T BE NICE, FORGIVING
AND SOBER ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.493
HEY.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.194
DADDY!
 (laughs)

36:36.194 --> 36:37.526
DADDY!

36:37.526 --> 36:39.928
MMM! MWAH! MISSED YOU GUYS.

36:39.928 --> 36:42.871
WOW! YOU'RE REALLY HELPING
MOMMY, HUH? THAT'S GREAT.

36:42.871 --> 36:45.774
THE SCARY MAN TOLD US
WE HAD TO.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.909
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GUY.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.912
HE LEFT A FLIER IN OUR MAILBOX.
YOU LEFT HIM DO YOUR PARENTING?

36:53.912 --> 36:58.287
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME TO GET CREATIVE.
 THIS WASN'T WHAT I MEANT!

36:58.287 --> 37:02.621
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. THEY TOLD
ME THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN ME.

37:02.621 --> 37:06.955
AND WHEN I WAS RUNNING THINGS,
THEY SAID THEY LOVED YOU MORE.

37:08.457 --> 37:10.599
REALLY?

37:10.599 --> 37:11.930
OH.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.932
SO DON'T GET
YOUR FEELINGS HURT,

37:13.932 --> 37:16.265
AND STOP ASKING STRANGERS
TO DISCIPLINE OUR KIDS.

37:16.265 --> 37:19.468
WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
IF YOU WOULD DO IT.

37:19.468 --> 37:21.510
(sighs)

37:21.510 --> 37:25.514
SO YOU WANT ME TO GO TO WORK ALL
DAY, GO OUT ON BUSINESS TRIPS,

37:25.514 --> 37:27.516
AND WHAT LITTLE TIME
I HAVE HERE WITH THE GIRLS,

37:27.516 --> 37:29.918
YOU WANT ME TO SPEND
SCREAMING AT THEM?

37:29.918 --> 37:33.482
JUST FOR THE FIRST 15 MINUTES
AFTER YOU WALK IN THE DOOR.

37:33.482 --> 37:36.925
THEN IT'S CARLOS TIME.
 FORGET IT! THIS WAS
THE ARRANGEMENT YOU WANTED.

37:36.925 --> 37:40.729
YOU MADE ME TAKE THIS JOB.
 I JUST WANTED US
TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE.

37:40.729 --> 37:43.432
WELL, GUESS WHAT, SWEETIE?
DAD'S UNHAPPY AT WORK.

37:43.432 --> 37:46.635
MOM'S HOME WITH
THE SCREAMING KIDS. YOU GOT ONE.

37:53.442 --> 37:56.705
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE BACK.

37:56.705 --> 37:58.577
CAN WE TALK?

37:58.577 --> 38:01.410
IF IT'S ABOUT WORK, YES.

38:01.410 --> 38:04.583
IF IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE BARBECUE, NO.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.586
FINE. THEN AS MY EMPLOYEE,
I AUTHORIZE A 5-MINUTE BREAK

38:07.586 --> 38:10.288
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT
MY SON'S BOYFRIEND

38:10.288 --> 38:12.491
AND HIS ABSURD OVERREACTION
THIS AFTERNOON.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.663
THAT'S IT. I'M OUT OF HERE.

38:14.663 --> 38:17.666
ANDREW, PLEASE. YOU WERE THERE.
ALEX STARTED THE WHOLE THING.

38:17.666 --> 38:19.998
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM
TO STOP CRITICIZING ME.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.000
I'M--I'M NOT GETTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.633
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ALEX,
YOU TELL HIM.

38:24.633 --> 38:27.376
I TRIED.
HE WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

38:27.376 --> 38:29.838
DON'T YOU MEAN OBEY?

38:29.838 --> 38:32.541
HE'S NOT YOUR SON.
HE'S NOT YOUR HUSBAND.

38:32.541 --> 38:33.982
HE'S NOT YOUR EMPLOYEE.

38:33.982 --> 38:36.615
NOT EVERYONE
HAS TO LISTEN TO YOU.

38:38.387 --> 38:41.420
I'LL--I'LL DO THIS TOMORROW.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.614
I GOT THE FLOWERS.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.382
THEY WERE FROM YOU, RIGHT?

39:13.382 --> 39:15.484
OH, YEAH.

39:35.474 --> 39:38.577
(car door shuts)

39:38.577 --> 39:40.579
I JUST HAVE A MINUTE,

39:40.579 --> 39:43.682
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO
A WHOLE THING WITH YOU.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.684
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

39:45.684 --> 39:49.588
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT ANYMORE.
PLEASE, JUST TAKE THE HOUSE.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.621
(sighs)

39:52.621 --> 39:55.624
I DON'T KNOW
HOW ELSE TO SAY THIS.

39:55.624 --> 39:57.926
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY
IS GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

39:57.926 --> 40:00.569
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
THE LAST TIME WE FIGHT,

40:00.569 --> 40:02.771
'CAUSE THAT'S WHO WE ARE.

40:02.771 --> 40:06.735
LET'S NOT MAKE IT WORSE
BY LIVING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.839
ALEX...

40:10.839 --> 40:13.442
(sighs deeply)

40:13.442 --> 40:15.744
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY--

40:15.744 --> 40:19.548
NOT ORSON, NOT ANDREW,
JUST YOU.

40:25.654 --> 40:29.598
I KNOW THAT I'VE CHANGED
SINCE MY BUSINESS TOOK OFF,

40:29.598 --> 40:32.531
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT.

40:32.531 --> 40:37.606
I'VE WATCHED MYSELF BECOME
SELFISH, IMPATIENT, RUDE.

40:37.606 --> 40:41.039
I WAS NEVER THE TYPE
TO SUFFER FOOLS GLADLY,

40:41.039 --> 40:44.172
BUT NOW I SEEM
TO FIND FOOLS EVERYWHERE.

40:44.172 --> 40:46.675
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE THAT WAY.

40:48.216 --> 40:50.949
I NEED SOMEONE WHO ISN'T AFRAID
TO SPEAK OUT,

40:50.949 --> 40:55.724
TO CALL ME OUT
WHEN I CROSS THOSE LINES,

40:55.724 --> 40:59.187
AND I WOULD LOVE IT
IF YOU WOULD BE THAT PERSON.

41:02.691 --> 41:04.192
DID MY MOTHER-IN-LAW

41:04.192 --> 41:08.036
JUST GIVE ME PERMISSION
TO CRITICIZE HER?
 YES, I DID.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.142
I'M A LUCKY GUY.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.181
EDIE.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.713
HI.

41:24.713 --> 41:25.714
HI.

41:25.714 --> 41:28.887
LISTEN, I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT YOU LYING TO ME,

41:28.887 --> 41:30.889
BUT YOU'RE NOT A BAD MAN.

41:30.889 --> 41:34.893
AND, WELL, I'M THINKING,
WHATEVER'S GOING ON,

41:34.893 --> 41:36.895
WE CAN WORK IT OUT.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.667
REALLY?

41:38.667 --> 41:42.200
YEAH.

41:42.200 --> 41:47.736
PLUS, YOU MAKE A GREAT MARTINI,
AND I'M DYING FOR ONE.

41:50.539 --> 41:52.010
I'LL GET MY STUFF.

41:59.748 --> 42:03.622
(dialing)

42:05.994 --> 42:08.727
(Jackson) Hello?

42:08.727 --> 42:10.699
JACKSON, HI.
DO YOU HAVE A SEC?

42:10.699 --> 42:12.701
Sure, Susan. What's wrong?

42:12.701 --> 42:16.104
UH, NO, NOTHING'S WRONG.
JUST...

42:16.104 --> 42:20.308
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS MOVE.

42:20.308 --> 42:25.614
AT 5:15 THAT AFTERNOON,

42:25.614 --> 42:27.676
EDIE WILLIAMS
BEGAN CALLING HER FRIENDS

42:27.676 --> 42:32.080
TO INFORM THEM
THAT HER HUSBAND HAD COME HOME.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.954
SADLY, SHE NEVER GOT THROUGH
TO ANY OF THEM.

42:35.954 --> 42:39.327
GABRIELLE SOLIS
NEVER HEARD HER PHONE RING.

42:39.327 --> 42:41.329
SHE WAS TOO BUSY

42:41.329 --> 42:44.593
WATCHING HER HUSBAND
DISCIPLINE THEIR CHILDREN...

42:44.593 --> 42:48.136
AND TRYING NOT TO SMILE.

42:48.136 --> 42:50.799
LYNETTE WAS OUT
WHEN EDIE CALLED HER.

42:50.799 --> 42:52.901
(both laughing)

42:52.901 --> 42:54.903
SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER,

42:54.903 --> 42:58.306
LAUGHING AND SHARING STORIES
ABOUT THE OLD DAYS...

42:58.306 --> 43:02.751
AND ENJOYING
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

43:02.751 --> 43:04.212
BREE COULDN'T PICK UP

43:04.212 --> 43:08.086
BECAUSE SHE WAS
WITH HER NEW SON-IN-LAW.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.859
SHE WAS SHOWING HIM
PAINT SAMPLES...

43:10.859 --> 43:14.663
AND CHOOSING HER WORDS
VERY CAREFULLY.

43:14.663 --> 43:16.795
AND SUSAN--

43:16.795 --> 43:20.328
WELL, SHE DIDN'T
ANSWER HER PHONE

43:20.328 --> 43:22.901
BECAUSE SHE WAS
SITTING IN HER FAVORITE CHAIR

43:22.901 --> 43:25.233
WITH A CUP OF TEA...

43:25.233 --> 43:28.206
ENJOYING, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

43:28.206 --> 43:31.880
THE FEELING OF BEING ALONE.
