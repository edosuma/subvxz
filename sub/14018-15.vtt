NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:09.699 --> 00:13.579
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:13.636 --> 00:15.445
the police who
investigate crime

00:15.505 --> 00:18.315
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:18.374 --> 00:20.115
These are their stories.

00:20.910 --> 00:24.016
MANNY: Even in winter, the
park is full of things to eat.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.392
The fruit of the staghorn sumac
are edible and taste like lemon.

00:32.789 --> 00:34.735
(EXCLAIMS) I'm not
tasting any lemon.

00:34.791 --> 00:36.099
I taste it.

00:36.692 --> 00:38.968
I know lemon.
This isn't lemon.

00:39.028 --> 00:40.507
It tastes lemony.

00:40.563 --> 00:42.543
Can I continue the tour?

00:42.965 --> 00:44.638
Over here we have
high-brush cranberries

00:44.700 --> 00:46.338
which are actually sweeter...
Lina, look.

00:46.402 --> 00:48.746
Somebody threw some
nice boots in the lake.

00:48.805 --> 00:50.580
MANNY: Stay with the group.

00:51.441 --> 00:54.581
Oh, my God! They still
have feet in them.

00:55.578 --> 00:58.422
The victim was in a T-shirt
and jockeys and cowboy boots.

00:58.481 --> 01:00.461
We're still looking for
the rest of his clothes.

01:00.516 --> 01:01.961
Hunting season for cowboys?

01:02.018 --> 01:03.053
Looks like.

01:03.119 --> 01:05.622
I counted six entry wounds,
small caliber,

01:05.688 --> 01:08.168
and we got several blunt
force blows to the face.

01:08.224 --> 01:09.362
How long was he soaking?

01:09.425 --> 01:10.495
Hard to tell,

01:10.560 --> 01:13.097
maybe 6 hours,
12 on the outside.

01:13.162 --> 01:15.574
We got some clothes
in the woods.

01:16.999 --> 01:19.377
Hey, hey! Let's be careful
where we step, huh.

01:19.435 --> 01:20.914
Yeah, yeah.

01:22.104 --> 01:24.414
Looks like
good quality threads.

01:26.275 --> 01:28.346
Pants pockets have
been turned inside out.

01:28.411 --> 01:29.617
No wallet.

01:29.679 --> 01:31.386
Could have been
a sex thing, huh?

01:31.447 --> 01:33.484
Hooker mugged him just as he
was getting down to business.

01:33.549 --> 01:36.962
Yeah. Right. Pick up a date for the
night, why waste money on a hotel?

01:37.053 --> 01:39.431
All right. Seal it off
and get CSU up here.

01:39.489 --> 01:41.901
Always the romantic,
huh, Lennie?

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074

02:30.973 --> 02:33.647
Six gunshot wounds
to the chest and gut.

02:33.709 --> 02:36.417
Four blunt force
injuries to the face.

02:36.479 --> 02:39.551
Marks on the wounds indicate he might've
been worked over with a piece of rebar.

02:39.615 --> 02:41.253
We got divers working the lake.

02:41.317 --> 02:43.661
Have them look for teeth.
Most of his were knocked out.

02:43.719 --> 02:45.790
So much for dental records.

02:45.855 --> 02:48.802
I found something
better than dental records.

02:49.959 --> 02:51.870
He got a chin implant.

02:52.395 --> 02:56.036
Along with some nose work, a face
lift and ear lobes shortened.

02:56.098 --> 02:58.772
Guy spent all that dough, winds
up looking like hamburger.

02:59.035 --> 03:02.141
Oh. Speaking of.
Stomach contents.

03:04.140 --> 03:08.589
Veal piccata, capers,
risotto, asparagus, salad.

03:09.178 --> 03:11.488
That could be arugula,
could be spinach.

03:11.547 --> 03:13.424
Peanuts, red wine,
and espresso.

03:13.482 --> 03:15.325
All within an hour
before he was killed.

03:15.384 --> 03:17.489
So he was coming from
an Italian restaurant.

03:17.553 --> 03:20.557
And before that, corned beef on
rye, mustard and french fries.

03:20.623 --> 03:22.569
This guy eats like you, Lennie.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.199
Thanks.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.397
These are from Dookies, a
bootmaker in Billings, Montana.

03:27.463 --> 03:28.533
Any record of sale?

03:28.598 --> 03:30.168
No. They went out of
business two years go.

03:30.232 --> 03:32.610
The underwear and the socks
are a store brand,

03:32.668 --> 03:35.376
Diefenbaker's stores
in Montana, the Dakotas.

03:35.805 --> 03:37.341
So the guy was a tourist?

03:37.406 --> 03:40.979
The suit and the overcoat are from
Garibaldi's, downtown. Off the rack.

03:41.043 --> 03:43.421
Going by the cut, I'd say they
were bought four, five years ago.

03:43.479 --> 03:46.688
So the guy buys his suits in New
York and his underwear in Montana?

03:46.749 --> 03:48.729
Gloves are Isotoners. Could
have been bought anywhere.

03:48.784 --> 03:50.161
No name tags, laundry markings?

03:50.219 --> 03:52.722
No. Just marinara
sauce on his shirt

03:52.788 --> 03:55.064
and caramel sugar
on the lining of his gloves.

03:55.124 --> 03:58.105
We sent his particulars to half
a dozen states in the Midwest.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.161
No nibbles yet.

03:59.228 --> 04:00.400
Tourists stay at hotels.

04:00.463 --> 04:02.670
No hotel key.
He got cleaned out.

04:02.732 --> 04:05.576
$100 million worth
of forensic technology

04:05.634 --> 04:08.740
and all we got is a John Doe
cowboy with a big appetite.

04:08.804 --> 04:10.340
We can narrow down
his last stop

04:10.439 --> 04:12.749
to one of 200 Italian
restaurants near the park.

04:12.808 --> 04:14.219
Yeah. Unless he ate
at a friend's.

04:14.276 --> 04:17.314
Well, that only keeps us
out of the hardware stores.

04:17.380 --> 04:22.193
Let's see, the lab found caramel
sugar on the inside of his gloves.

04:22.885 --> 04:25.764
Didn't they also find peanuts
next to his veal piccata?

04:25.855 --> 04:27.391
Those hot peanuts
you buy on the street?

04:27.456 --> 04:29.197
You can smell them
two blocks away.

04:29.258 --> 04:31.898
Check out the vendors
around the park.

04:33.963 --> 04:35.670
Oh! Why can't these
be good for you?

04:35.731 --> 04:37.005
Because then you
wouldn't eat them.

04:37.066 --> 04:38.636
How you doing?
Let me ask you something.

04:38.701 --> 04:41.307
Were you working here on
Tuesday night around 10:00?

04:41.370 --> 04:43.111
I am here every
day until 10:00.

04:43.172 --> 04:45.743
Well, do you remember selling a
bag of peanuts to a white guy

04:45.808 --> 04:47.344
about that time on Tuesday,

04:47.410 --> 04:50.357
wore a camel-hair coat,
pair of cowboy boots?

04:50.846 --> 04:52.723
Oh, yeah. Cowboy boots.

04:53.249 --> 04:57.129
Yeah. That guy gave me a $50
bill for a $1 bag of peanuts.

04:57.186 --> 04:58.927
Took all my change.

04:59.221 --> 05:01.599
Said he was sorry
but he gave his singles

05:01.657 --> 05:03.967
to the waiter at
Bella Flora's over there.

05:04.026 --> 05:05.061
MAITRE D': Do you
have a picture?

05:05.127 --> 05:06.128
The way he looks right now,

05:06.195 --> 05:09.267
a picture wouldn't help. But he
might have had a Midwest accent.

05:09.331 --> 05:11.743
He was wearing a camel-hair
coat from Garibaldi's

05:11.801 --> 05:12.871
and a pair of cowboy boots.

05:12.935 --> 05:14.414
Oh, yes, I remember.

05:14.470 --> 05:18.441
He had dinner with another gentleman.
Tweed jacket, gray hair.

05:18.507 --> 05:19.508
CURTIS: You took
the reservation?

05:19.575 --> 05:21.748
No. The day girl
takes them. Here.

05:22.378 --> 05:23.448
Yes.

05:25.848 --> 05:29.227
Yes. It's, under the name Curren.
No phone number.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.788
You remember this guy because
of the Garibaldi coat?

05:31.854 --> 05:32.855
No.

05:32.922 --> 05:35.300
When he was leaving,
he looked out the window

05:35.357 --> 05:37.132
and he saw a guy in a car
across the street

05:37.193 --> 05:38.900
who was watching
the restaurant.

05:38.961 --> 05:41.498
He asked me to show him
to the back exit.

05:41.564 --> 05:43.202
He say why?
No.

05:43.799 --> 05:45.870
I was concerned about the
guy in the car, too.

05:45.935 --> 05:47.881
We've been robbed
twice in the past year.

05:47.937 --> 05:50.247
So, I wrote down
the license number.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.808
Our lucky day.

05:52.374 --> 05:56.686
So, uh, who paid for the dinner, the
tweed jacket or the Garibaldi coat?

05:56.746 --> 05:58.748
The Garibaldi coat. Cash.

05:58.881 --> 06:02.624
Oh, and the accent, when he
ordered wine, he spoke Italian.

06:03.219 --> 06:04.857
Brooklyn Italian.

06:08.257 --> 06:09.998
VICKY: That car's assigned
to one of our sales reps.

06:10.059 --> 06:11.970
Which one?
John DeMayo.

06:12.027 --> 06:13.734
Is he in?
No.

06:13.796 --> 06:14.968
When will he be back?

06:15.030 --> 06:16.168
Depends.

06:16.232 --> 06:18.337
Well, what, is he
out on a call?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.710
I don't know. Um, why
don't you leave your card

06:20.770 --> 06:23.080
and when he calls in, I'll
give him your information.

06:23.139 --> 06:25.983
Okay. Meantime, mind if we
take a look in his office?

06:26.041 --> 06:27.645
We won't touch anything.

06:27.710 --> 06:29.587
I guess. It's this way.

06:30.379 --> 06:31.756
This is it.

06:32.681 --> 06:33.751
July.

06:33.816 --> 06:35.625
DeMayo must be
on the road a lot.

06:35.684 --> 06:37.425
You have his home address?

06:37.486 --> 06:38.624
Sure.

06:46.962 --> 06:48.407
John DeMayo?

06:48.464 --> 06:50.375
Johnny. Who are you guys?

06:50.432 --> 06:53.208
Detectives, Johnny. We need
to ask you a few questions.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.339
Like what?

06:54.403 --> 06:56.246
Like how'd a guy like you
luck into a job

06:56.305 --> 06:57.579
you don't have to show up for?

06:57.640 --> 06:59.950
Come on. I'm making a living, okay.
What do you guys want?

07:00.009 --> 07:03.218
Tuesday night, somebody saw you in
this car in front of Bella Flora's.

07:03.279 --> 07:06.453
Yeah, sure. I remember that. I was
waiting for a chick. Blind date.

07:06.515 --> 07:07.892
Oh, yeah?
What's her name?

07:07.950 --> 07:10.294
Gina something. She stood me
up, so I went to another bar.

07:10.352 --> 07:11.592
What are you, her brother?

07:11.654 --> 07:13.065
This bar have a name?

07:13.122 --> 07:16.660
A bar with a name. You know
what, that's a great idea.

07:16.725 --> 07:19.399
It was Donny's in Ozone Park. I
was there the rest of the night.

07:19.461 --> 07:21.463
And Donny says whatever
you tell him to, right?

07:21.530 --> 07:23.976
Hey, look guys, you know, I just
stopped in here to tap a kidney.

07:24.033 --> 07:25.808
I've got to meet people in the city.
So if we're done...

07:25.868 --> 07:27.939
Yeah. We'll talk again,
Johnny. Soon.

07:31.841 --> 07:34.287
The only rugs he moves have
bodies rolled up in them.

07:34.343 --> 07:35.344
So we got this mook

07:35.411 --> 07:39.860
and a victim from Montana with plastic
surgery who speaks Brooklyn Italian.

07:39.915 --> 07:41.986
Our victim's
a wiseguy in hiding?

07:42.051 --> 07:44.588
A wiseguy whose
prints aren't on file.

07:44.653 --> 07:46.997
Let's talk to
the U.S. Marshals.

07:47.656 --> 07:50.034
Sorry, I came up blank
on those prints.

07:50.092 --> 07:52.129
So you're saying
whoever's prints these are

07:52.194 --> 07:53.730
isn't in your
Witness Protection Program?

07:53.796 --> 07:56.777
Our policy is we can't confirm
or deny who's in the program.

07:56.832 --> 07:58.209
What's this regarding?

07:58.267 --> 08:00.543
The prints came up in connection
with an investigation.

08:00.603 --> 08:02.378
What type of investigation? No.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.679
First you tell us
whose prints these are.

08:04.740 --> 08:07.186
We have our policies
too, Mr. Wheeler.

08:07.509 --> 08:09.546
Sorry I couldn't help you.

08:09.612 --> 08:11.922
Call if you need anything else.

08:13.082 --> 08:16.495
I removed the chin implant to give
me the true width of the jaw.

08:16.552 --> 08:20.090
I lengthened the earlobes.
Tucked in the cheek bones.

08:20.155 --> 08:23.432
But the nose is a first,
he paid to make it bigger.

08:23.492 --> 08:24.732
You think it's him?

08:24.793 --> 08:26.363
Sure looks like him.

08:26.428 --> 08:27.805
I heard he was in Puerto Rico.

08:27.863 --> 08:29.069
Who are we talking about?

08:29.131 --> 08:31.907
Nick Lagrassa,
a.k.a. Nicky Shakes.

08:31.967 --> 08:35.676
Button man for the Virgini family.
Confessed to 23 murders.

08:35.738 --> 08:37.649
Three years ago
he testified for the Feds.

08:37.706 --> 08:40.482
Sent a dozen guys to Leavenworth
for the rest of their lives.

08:40.543 --> 08:43.456
Well, now we know where he'll
spend the rest of his.

08:43.511 --> 08:46.254
Can't wait to tell
the Marshals. Thanks.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.623
WHEELER: This individual's
in your morgue?

08:48.684 --> 08:51.460
Cut the crap. You got his
prints, you got his photos.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.056
Is it Lagrassa?

08:53.889 --> 08:55.391
It's Lagrassa.

08:56.725 --> 08:58.102
How long has he been dead?

08:58.160 --> 08:59.833
Since Tuesday night last week.

08:59.895 --> 09:01.897
Tapped six times,
.22 caliber.

09:01.964 --> 09:02.999
Suspects?

09:03.065 --> 09:05.204
How about answering
one of our questions.

09:05.267 --> 09:06.940
What was he doing in New York?

09:07.803 --> 09:09.942
Frankly, we don't have a clue.

09:13.842 --> 09:15.981
Mr. Lagrassa left
his relocation site

09:16.045 --> 09:18.286
a week ago
without authorization.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.460
What? He just
got homesick?

09:20.516 --> 09:22.996
Any outstanding items
on his court schedule?

09:23.052 --> 09:24.656
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.929
Listen, I don't need to play slap
and tickle with the U.S. Attorney.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.731
The only leak you should
be concerned about

09:29.792 --> 09:31.897
is the one to the press
if you don't cooperate.

09:31.961 --> 09:33.269
(SIGHS)

09:33.729 --> 09:37.643
We've been putting together a
RICO case against Alberto Napoli.

09:38.033 --> 09:40.104
Lagrassa was going to testify
that he was present

09:40.169 --> 09:43.776
when Napoli ordered the hit on
Louie Bonaventura five years ago.

09:43.839 --> 09:47.309
Napoli's a big fish, killing
Lagrassa's right up his alley.

09:47.376 --> 09:50.721
Napoli's arrest was still
six months down the road

09:50.779 --> 09:53.020
and only if we could lock in
corroborating evidence.

09:53.082 --> 09:55.722
All right, thanks for
the information.

09:55.784 --> 09:57.263
We'll take it from here.

09:57.319 --> 09:59.799
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
this is our case.

10:00.289 --> 10:01.529
Lagrassa is our witness.

10:01.590 --> 10:02.762
Was your witness.

10:02.825 --> 10:05.931
If you think you can just come...
Excuse me. Mr. Campos,

10:05.995 --> 10:08.908
I'm not into all this
piss-and-mark-your-territory crap.

10:08.964 --> 10:11.774
If I need your help,
I will call you.

10:11.834 --> 10:15.213
You don't, you'll be talking
to the Attorney General.

10:17.940 --> 10:19.248
CURTIS: Well, so far,

10:19.308 --> 10:22.118
we only know that Johnny DeMayo
was staking out the restaurant.

10:22.177 --> 10:24.179
And that Lagrassa
tried to avoid him.

10:24.246 --> 10:26.988
What about Lagrassa's dinner
date, the tweed jacket?

10:27.049 --> 10:28.050
Dead end.

10:28.117 --> 10:29.528
(PHONE RINGING)

10:30.986 --> 10:32.056
Yeah.

10:33.422 --> 10:34.662
Hold on.

10:36.191 --> 10:37.295
Curtis.

10:38.193 --> 10:39.331
Where?

10:40.195 --> 10:41.606
Okay, thanks.

10:42.498 --> 10:45.809
Well, the trace on Lagrassa's
new identity as Michael Tobias

10:45.868 --> 10:50.010
has him using a credit card authorization
for a hotel off of Madison.

10:52.941 --> 10:54.284
Oh, God!

11:02.184 --> 11:03.629
They didn't miss a thing.

11:03.685 --> 11:06.757
Yeah. Except for some beaded belts.
Silver buckles.

11:06.822 --> 11:09.200
Lagrassa really went whole
hog for the cowboy look.

11:09.258 --> 11:10.828
What happened here?
Who's Lagrassa?

11:10.893 --> 11:11.997
Never mind.

11:12.061 --> 11:14.541
We're gonna need a list of
phone calls from this room.

11:14.596 --> 11:16.473
Isn't Mr. Tobias
coming back?

11:16.532 --> 11:17.704
No.

11:19.768 --> 11:21.213
Well, Lagrassa was
living it up.

11:21.270 --> 11:24.114
Most of his local calls
were to escort services.

11:24.173 --> 11:27.154
The rest were to
the Hotel Vogue on 57th.

11:27.209 --> 11:29.155
The 1935 number?
Yeah.

11:29.211 --> 11:32.385
Well, check this out. The
calls to the 406 area code,

11:32.448 --> 11:35.554
that's a phone company
message center in Montana.

11:35.884 --> 11:37.864
Looks like he was calling
there every half hour.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.332
Right before he
called the Hotel Vogue.

11:40.389 --> 11:43.336
He calls Montana, picks up a message
from somebody at the Vogue,

11:43.392 --> 11:44.928
then calls them.

11:44.993 --> 11:48.372
Right. Lagrassa didn't want anybody
calling him direct at his hotel.

11:48.430 --> 11:50.000
The question is,
who at the Vogue

11:50.065 --> 11:52.773
was leaving messages
for him in Montana.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.580
Do you have any idea how many
people stay here a night?

11:55.637 --> 11:58.379
No, why don't we close the place
down and do a head count?

11:58.440 --> 12:01.387
Mr. Walerstein,
I think I found the guest.

12:01.443 --> 12:03.548
Dozens of calls to
the 406 area code.

12:03.612 --> 12:05.387
The last one was this morning.

12:05.447 --> 12:07.927
Ned Curren, Sydney, Australia.

12:07.983 --> 12:10.930
But the credit card's
in the name of Brendan Hall.

12:10.986 --> 12:13.159
Mr. Hall checked
in as Ned Curren.

12:13.222 --> 12:14.792
Mr. Hall's
a distinguished author.

12:14.857 --> 12:17.337
He doesn't want his
fans bothering him.

12:23.632 --> 12:26.374
Don't worry. I just
bought it for the picture.

12:26.435 --> 12:30.212
"When the world's most eligible
bachelor finally decided to marry,"

12:30.272 --> 12:34.049
"many hoped it would be to someone
who looked more like Jackie O."

12:34.109 --> 12:35.349
Thank God for the Kennedys.

12:35.410 --> 12:38.152
Otherwise, a lot of bad writers
would be waiting tables.

12:39.248 --> 12:40.727
Brendan Hall?

12:42.417 --> 12:44.158
Oh, sorry. I thought you
might be process servers.

12:44.219 --> 12:45.698
You want me to
sign that for you?

12:45.754 --> 12:47.256
Actually, we're detectives.

12:48.223 --> 12:49.463
What's this about?

12:49.525 --> 12:51.232
Nicholas Lagrassa.
You know him?

12:51.927 --> 12:52.928
Can't say I do.

12:52.995 --> 12:54.975
He's the guy you were exchanging
phone calls with last week.

12:55.030 --> 12:57.203
Also the guy you shared
a bottle of Chianti with

12:57.266 --> 12:59.246
at Bella Rosa's
last Tuesday night.

12:59.301 --> 13:00.712
What about him?

13:00.769 --> 13:01.804
He's dead.

13:03.038 --> 13:05.075
Dead? My God.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.585
You feel like answering
some questions now?

13:08.944 --> 13:11.288
I better talk to my lawyer
before I say anything.

13:11.346 --> 13:14.259
Fine. He can meet you
down at the precinct.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.068
Mr. Lagrassa was looking
for a ghost writer

13:25.127 --> 13:27.630
to do a book about
his life in crime.

13:27.863 --> 13:29.638
I flew in from Sydney
to meet with him.

13:29.698 --> 13:31.769
This scum admits
to killing 23 people

13:31.833 --> 13:33.244
and you think he rates a book?

13:33.302 --> 13:36.476
An insider's look at the mob?
The public eats this stuff up.

13:36.538 --> 13:39.348
Look, Joe Bonanno wrote a
book, so did Henry Hill,

13:39.408 --> 13:41.513
Sammy "The Bull..."
Barry.

13:43.078 --> 13:46.525
Detective, I find the idea of making
money off of Lagrassa's crimes

13:46.582 --> 13:48.493
as repulsive as you do.

13:48.550 --> 13:50.962
But I admit I was curious.

13:52.054 --> 13:54.933
You don't often get
to meet a real hitman.

13:55.390 --> 13:57.495
So you had dinner with him.

13:58.126 --> 14:01.733
It took a lot of cloak-and-dagger
phone calls to arrange.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.175
Afterwards, I told him I
wasn't interested and I left.

14:04.233 --> 14:05.678
Who knew where you
were having dinner?

14:05.734 --> 14:07.236
No one.
Lagrassa insisted.

14:07.302 --> 14:09.873
VAN BUREN: Who made the
reservation at Bella Flora's?

14:09.938 --> 14:11.246
I did.

14:11.707 --> 14:14.278
You just pulled
the name out of Zagat's?

14:14.409 --> 14:17.015
The hotel concierge
recommended it to me.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.752
Bella Flora's has
an outstanding reputation.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.797
Why, did someone find
a roach in their soup?

14:23.852 --> 14:25.354
Read the badges
carefully, Lionel.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.990
We're not from
the health department.

14:27.055 --> 14:31.231
Hall's dinner partner was murdered after
he left the restaurant you picked.

14:31.293 --> 14:32.772
I didn't have anything
to do with a murder.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.239
You recommended a restaurant

14:34.296 --> 14:36.105
where this guy
had his last meal.

14:36.164 --> 14:37.939
You're involved.
Let me tell you something,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.379
the job concierge takes on a
whole new meaning in Attica.

14:43.405 --> 14:45.646
Danny Maxwell in housekeeping.

14:46.708 --> 14:49.314
He paid me $100 to tell him
when Hall went anywhere.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.825
I didn't give a penny
to that little flamer.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.325
He says you did.

14:53.382 --> 14:55.328
He says, she says.

14:55.384 --> 14:58.593
We looked up your jacket, Danny.
You're on parole.

14:58.654 --> 14:59.860
We hook you up to this hit,

14:59.921 --> 15:03.027
you're gonna go back upstate for
the rest of your crummy life.

15:03.091 --> 15:04.502
Hey, this guy Hall got hit?

15:05.761 --> 15:08.901
Well, you know how the D.A.'s gonna look at it.
You set Hall up.

15:08.964 --> 15:10.136
I swear I didn't know.

15:10.198 --> 15:12.041
Well, who paid you
to keep tabs on Hall?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.374
I tell you, what am I in for?

15:13.435 --> 15:15.381
Maybe facilitation,
you do a bullet,

15:15.437 --> 15:17.576
you'll be back here
folding sheets.

15:18.707 --> 15:22.154
This guy I know from the union.
He gave me 500 bucks.

15:22.744 --> 15:24.621
Name of Johnny DeMayo.

Lennie.

15:39.227 --> 15:40.570
I 90¢ you.

15:52.407 --> 15:54.216
He's still breathing.

15:59.715 --> 16:02.753
The doctors say he's got a
punctured lung, fractured ribs.

16:02.818 --> 16:05.298
One bullet missed his heart
by about half an inch.

16:05.354 --> 16:06.856
Fat and muscle's
what saved him.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.560
Can he talk?
Barely.

16:08.623 --> 16:10.102
Any idea who shot him?

16:10.158 --> 16:12.502
Probably the same people who
paid him to whack Lagrassa.

16:12.561 --> 16:14.165
Guys like DeMayo
are expendable.

16:14.229 --> 16:15.537
SALTZMAN: I need to see him.

16:15.597 --> 16:16.905
Hey! Who are you?

16:16.999 --> 16:19.001
Mort Saltzman.
I'm Mr. DeMayo's attorney.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.013
His mother told me
he was here under arrest.

16:21.069 --> 16:24.278
We need to talk, Mr. Saltzman.
Then you can see your client.

16:26.041 --> 16:29.113
Rey, what happened
at DeMayo's door?

16:29.678 --> 16:31.954
What? You starting to
pull your punches?

16:32.247 --> 16:33.487
No. It was nothing.

16:33.548 --> 16:34.788
Nothing?

16:34.916 --> 16:36.657
You want to talk about it?

16:36.718 --> 16:38.129
Won't happen again.

16:39.087 --> 16:40.293
I hope not.

16:42.924 --> 16:45.063
SALTZMAN: Do we absolutely
have to do this now?

16:45.127 --> 16:48.336
JACK: In a couple of days,
I might not feel so generous.

16:49.698 --> 16:52.076
I discussed your
offer with Mr. DeMayo.

16:52.134 --> 16:55.013
He indicated he had nothing
to do with Lagrassa's death.

16:55.070 --> 16:58.381
The people who tried to kill
him seem to think he does.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.477
Mr. DeMayo woke up
in the middle of the night

17:00.542 --> 17:03.489
and found two black men
burglarizing his apartment.

17:03.545 --> 17:04.546
They shot him.

17:04.613 --> 17:08.117
So he just coincidentally followed
Mr. Hall to a meeting with Lagrassa

17:08.183 --> 17:10.595
hours before
Lagrassa was killed?

17:17.325 --> 17:19.862
Officer, remove
those handcuffs.

17:19.928 --> 17:21.031
What are you doing?

17:21.096 --> 17:23.041
I'm pulling the guard
detail from his room.

17:23.098 --> 17:24.441
You can't do that.
He's under arrest.

17:24.499 --> 17:26.342
Not anymore.
He's on his own.

17:26.401 --> 17:29.041
Those burglars can come
stuff a pillow in his face

17:29.104 --> 17:30.913
and finish the job
for all I care.

17:30.972 --> 17:32.315
DEMAYO: Wait.

17:41.216 --> 17:43.162
He wants the same
deal Lagrassa got.

17:43.218 --> 17:44.856
Four years in jail?

17:46.154 --> 17:47.656
One year.

17:48.256 --> 17:50.497
Lagrassa admitted
to 23 killings.

17:50.559 --> 17:53.005
My client is only
accused of one murder.

17:53.061 --> 17:56.338
And he wants to be put in the
Federal Witness Protection Program.

17:56.398 --> 17:58.708
That's up to the
U.S. Attorney.

17:59.101 --> 18:00.375
I'm sure you could work it out.

18:00.435 --> 18:01.937
Assuming we can,
what do we get?

18:06.141 --> 18:07.347
Al Napoli.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.355
He ordered the hit on Lagrassa?

18:12.414 --> 18:14.018
Told me himself.

It's okay, Pop.

He had a stroke eight months ago.
He's not right in the head.

18:46.448 --> 18:47.927
You have the right
to an attorney.

18:47.983 --> 18:50.725
If you can't afford one, one will be
appointed to you by a court of law.

Your Honor, that's inhumane.

eight months ago.

19:15.610 --> 19:17.715
He's under the constant
care of his doctor.

19:17.779 --> 19:19.690
He should be sent home ROR.

19:19.748 --> 19:22.160
He was healthy enough to order
the murders of two witnesses.

We want him held where he'll be unable
to conduct his criminal activities.

tantamount to a death sentence.

province of the U.S. Attorney's office.

We screw up, they'll
eat us for breakfast.

21:00.248 --> 21:02.660
DEMAYO: I caught up
with him in the park.

21:03.118 --> 21:06.099
I took him into the woods,
and then I clipped him.

21:06.154 --> 21:08.327
ROSS: Describe exactly
what you did.

21:08.390 --> 21:10.427
I had him take off his clothes.

21:11.026 --> 21:13.233
I let him keep his boots.

21:13.295 --> 21:15.070
Then I shot him
twice in the chest.

21:15.864 --> 21:18.674
He went down. I shot
him four more times.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.604
I found a piece of
rebar on the path.

21:21.670 --> 21:23.377
I used it to bust up his face.

21:23.438 --> 21:25.179
Why did you have him undress?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.516
To show disrespect.
That's what you do.

21:27.575 --> 21:29.521
ROSS: And breaking his teeth?

21:29.577 --> 21:31.056
For opening his mouth.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.626
Hey, I hope this
protection program works.

21:33.682 --> 21:35.787
I got my teeth
capped last year.

21:36.484 --> 21:38.122
Let's go on.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.632
Yeah, okay.

21:42.524 --> 21:46.495
So then I did all that, and
then I put him in the lake.

21:47.629 --> 21:49.472
Then I got his ID
out of his clothes.

21:49.531 --> 21:50.908
Why did you go to his hotel?

21:50.965 --> 21:53.275
DEMAYO: Napoli wanted me
to look for material

21:53.335 --> 21:55.076
related to what the Feds were up to.
(SIREN WAILING)

21:55.937 --> 21:58.611
Hey, I gotta hear that
every 10 minutes.

21:58.673 --> 22:00.175
The Marshals have
gotta move me.

22:00.241 --> 22:02.084
You're not going
anywhere, Mr. DeMayo.

22:02.143 --> 22:04.555
Hey, come on now. I'm the guy
who clipped Nicky Shakes.

22:04.613 --> 22:07.059
You have our
deepest appreciation.

22:08.416 --> 22:10.054
Just to be clear.

22:10.719 --> 22:12.494
You approached Napoli?

22:13.121 --> 22:14.225
Yeah.

22:14.989 --> 22:17.731
I heard this writer guy,
Brendan Hall, was in town

22:17.792 --> 22:19.499
and that he might
hook up with Lagrassa.

22:19.561 --> 22:20.869
Where did you hear that?

22:20.929 --> 22:22.704
A friend. They don't
wanna be involved.

22:22.764 --> 22:24.573
SALTZMAN: That individual can
be listed on the indictment

22:24.632 --> 22:27.010
as a John Doe
unindicted co-conspirator.

22:27.836 --> 22:30.749
So then, I told Paul Matera,

22:32.374 --> 22:34.115
and he told Napoli.

22:35.243 --> 22:37.883
And then I got to
see the man himself.

22:39.914 --> 22:41.916
And he told me he'd consider
it a personal favor

22:41.983 --> 22:43.690
if I clipped Lagrassa.

22:45.653 --> 22:49.032
We're going to need to corroborate
Napoli's involvement.

22:49.090 --> 22:50.228
DEMAYO: Like how?

22:50.291 --> 22:51.292
Another witness.

22:51.659 --> 22:53.969
Somebody else you told this to.

22:57.165 --> 22:58.337
Okay.

23:00.168 --> 23:02.079
I was seeing this girl,

23:02.837 --> 23:06.751
and she was with me when I picked
up a clean piece from Matera.

23:07.108 --> 23:10.817
But I don't know, her and me,
we were like oil and vinegar.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.687
ROSS: His name is Paul Matera.

23:17.585 --> 23:19.155
We think you met him
with Mr. DeMayo

23:19.220 --> 23:21.666
in a parking lot
four weeks ago.

23:25.260 --> 23:26.933
Yeah. And say I did.
Then what?

23:27.362 --> 23:30.707
You'd testify before a grand
jury and possibly at a trial.

23:33.668 --> 23:34.976
Whose trial?

23:35.036 --> 23:36.310
Alberto Napoli.

23:37.338 --> 23:38.544
(SIGHS)

23:40.141 --> 23:43.247
Johnny said he knew people like that.
I never believed him.

23:43.311 --> 23:45.052
ROSS: We can protect you.

23:45.647 --> 23:47.490
(SCOFFS)
You're kidding me, right?

23:47.549 --> 23:51.326
Look, maybe Johnny's stupid
enough to fall for that crap.

23:51.386 --> 23:54.128
You're already on
a hit list, Ms. Grant.

23:54.422 --> 23:55.799
Make no mistake,

23:56.591 --> 23:59.333
your only hope is
to cooperate with us.

24:00.762 --> 24:02.207
(SIGHS)

24:03.531 --> 24:05.340
Johnny and I had dinner,

24:05.400 --> 24:08.244
then he drove to this
parking lot on 23rd.

24:10.338 --> 24:12.215
That man was there.

24:12.807 --> 24:16.380
He gave Johnny a paper bag.
Johnny was all pumped up.

24:17.045 --> 24:19.616
Showed me what was in the bag.
It was a gun.

24:19.681 --> 24:22.287
He said it was gonna
change his life.

24:23.284 --> 24:24.763
DOBBS: (SCOFFS)
This is some indictment.

24:24.819 --> 24:28.631
Alberto Napoli, Paul
Matera, Johnny DeMayo,

24:28.690 --> 24:30.761
plus an unnamed
unindicted co-conspirator.

24:30.825 --> 24:32.168
Who would that be, Santa Claus?

24:32.227 --> 24:34.969
We're in a hurry, Mr. Dobbs.
We have other cases.

24:35.029 --> 24:37.202
And what does Adam Schiff
expect to get out of this,

24:37.265 --> 24:40.041
besides photo ops for his
re-election campaign, of course?

24:40.101 --> 24:41.603
Well, we're going
for a conviction.

24:41.669 --> 24:46.550
(LAUGHS) With a nobody like Johnny
DeMayo as your star witness?

24:46.608 --> 24:49.680
Look, even if someone
did want Lagrassa dead,

24:49.744 --> 24:53.123
I mean, the idea that they would trust
DeMayo with it, it's laughable.

24:53.181 --> 24:55.422
How smart do you have to be
to shoot an unarmed man?

24:55.483 --> 24:57.588
DOBBS: Look, I know you're all
on some sort of mission here,

24:57.785 --> 24:59.822
but this case is
never going to trial.

24:59.888 --> 25:03.267
I won't permit my client
to be made a spectacle of.

25:04.692 --> 25:08.139
Motion to dismiss. He is not
competent to stand trial.

25:11.232 --> 25:15.738
Since his stroke, Your Honor, Mr. Napoli
has suffered from disorientation,

25:15.803 --> 25:18.682
memory impairment,
auditory hallucination

25:18.740 --> 25:20.720
and paranoid delusions
of persecution.

25:20.775 --> 25:23.051
He neither understands
the charges

25:23.111 --> 25:25.318
nor can he assist
in his own defense.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.224
Their medical records can't
be taken at face value.

25:28.283 --> 25:32.663
This one diagnosed Mr. Napoli as
borderline retarded with an IQ of 61.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.927
This one diagnosed him
with an onset of Alzheimer's.

25:34.989 --> 25:36.991
Mr. Dobbs, your experts

25:37.058 --> 25:40.437
have him suffering from every
conceivable mental defect.

25:40.762 --> 25:44.676
Regardless, Your Honor, they rebut the
initial presumption of competency.

25:44.732 --> 25:46.643
The burden is now on the People

25:46.701 --> 25:48.908
to prove that my
client is competent.

25:49.304 --> 25:50.510
People v. Feyre.

25:50.572 --> 25:53.917
The fact that he controls a criminal
organization speaks for itself.

25:55.043 --> 25:57.990
I want to hear what the court
psychiatrist has to say first.

25:58.046 --> 26:00.322
I'm ordering a 730 exam.

26:03.818 --> 26:05.957
NAPOLI: A-B

26:08.056 --> 26:09.262
N...

26:11.359 --> 26:12.633
I forgot.

26:13.928 --> 26:16.374
DR. SKODA: How about spelling
your last name?

26:17.565 --> 26:19.306
I can hear singing.

26:20.869 --> 26:22.906
Am I getting baptized?

26:23.304 --> 26:25.477
Let's try something else.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.749
I want you to count down
from 30 by subtracting 3.

26:29.243 --> 26:33.020
Okay? So, 21, 24...

26:35.984 --> 26:37.054
Go ahead.

26:37.118 --> 26:38.927
Where's that singing
coming from?

26:40.622 --> 26:41.862
They're singing my name.

26:41.923 --> 26:44.426
It's okay, Pop.
There's no singing.

26:47.161 --> 26:49.300
You almost done?
He's tired.

26:49.364 --> 26:51.469
Just a few more questions.

26:52.901 --> 26:55.507
Mr. Napoli, do you know
where you are?

26:58.439 --> 27:01.352
Mr. Napoli, do you know
where you are?

27:03.711 --> 27:05.213
In school.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.725
Do you know you've
been arrested?

27:07.448 --> 27:09.257
The archangel Michael

27:10.351 --> 27:12.524
says I can't talk about that.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.225
Do you know you're
charged with murder?

27:14.956 --> 27:18.335
The archangel doesn't want
me talking about that.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.099
Who's the archangel Michael?

27:30.672 --> 27:31.810
Him.

27:38.579 --> 27:39.717
(SIGHS)

27:39.981 --> 27:41.619
RONNY: Now we're done?

27:42.183 --> 27:43.560
What, time to
change his diaper?

27:43.618 --> 27:45.393
Hey! He's sick.

27:45.453 --> 27:48.229
You think that's funny?
He has accidents.

27:49.123 --> 27:51.000
(LAUGHS) Al Napoli,
the diaper don.

27:51.059 --> 27:52.504
What did you say?

27:52.694 --> 27:54.605
Ronny.
You better apologize.

27:54.662 --> 27:56.232
What? Does he play
with himself in public, too?

27:56.297 --> 27:57.901
DOBBS: Calm down! Calm down.
RONNY: No.

27:57.965 --> 28:00.605
That son of a bitch's
gonna show some respect.

28:01.235 --> 28:03.044
You're right. I'm sorry.

28:05.740 --> 28:08.448
JACK: After claiming he
didn't know where he was,

28:08.509 --> 28:09.852
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON TV)

28:09.911 --> 28:15.327
Mr. Napoli suddenly became
sufficiently aware of his surroundings

28:18.019 --> 28:20.465
to quickly move
out of harm's way.

28:22.857 --> 28:26.100
That shows a remarkable
presence of mind.

28:27.462 --> 28:32.536
Your Honor, Dr. Skoda's examination
room theatrics notwithstanding,

28:33.734 --> 28:35.645
my client's behavior
is consistent

28:35.703 --> 28:38.616
with a diagnosis of
multi-infarct dementia,

28:39.407 --> 28:41.250
schizophrenia and Alzheimer's.

28:41.309 --> 28:44.483
JACK: Mr. Napoli's condition
is like a Chinese menu.

28:44.545 --> 28:47.549
They've taken symptoms
from columns A, B and C,

28:47.615 --> 28:49.754
to manufacture
a claim of incompetence.

28:49.817 --> 28:51.819
Your Honor,
is Mr. McCoy suggesting

28:51.886 --> 28:54.492
that my client is such
an accomplished actor

28:54.755 --> 28:56.894
that he can fool
experts from Bellevue,

28:56.958 --> 28:59.165
Columbia-Presbyterian,
Johns Hopkins?

28:59.227 --> 29:02.731
He didn't fool the camera. That
evidence speaks for itself.

29:02.797 --> 29:03.969
He's malingering.

29:04.032 --> 29:06.808
His condition is an elaborate
ruse to avoid prosecution.

29:06.868 --> 29:09.712
Your Honor, that is
state-sponsored blackmail.

29:09.771 --> 29:11.580
Calm down, Mr. Dobbs.

29:12.106 --> 29:14.347
This is a mental
competency hearing.

29:14.675 --> 29:17.053
I'm sure if the threat
of imminent prosecution

29:17.111 --> 29:18.954
were removed permanently,

29:19.013 --> 29:22.961
Mr. Napoli would experience
a remarkable recovery.

29:24.018 --> 29:27.022
I find the defendant fit
to proceed to trial.

29:27.688 --> 29:29.793
Parties to meet in
my chambers on Monday

29:29.857 --> 29:31.996
to set a trial date.
We're adjourned.

29:34.862 --> 29:37.206
You're trying to kill him.
That's what you want.

29:37.265 --> 29:38.710
What kind of people are you?

29:40.635 --> 29:42.444
This is gonna be fun.

29:44.906 --> 29:46.613
RUGGIERO: As these
photos show,

29:46.674 --> 29:50.918
Johnny DeMayo was a known associate
of the Napoli crime organization.

29:52.180 --> 29:55.992
In this photo, please identify
the man standing to his left.

29:56.050 --> 29:58.792
That's the second
defendant Paul Matera.

29:59.086 --> 30:01.259
He's what we call
a street boss.

30:01.322 --> 30:05.327
He oversees the day-to-day operations
of the Napoli organization.

30:06.994 --> 30:08.735
In your experience,

30:09.664 --> 30:13.168
could a street boss
order an assassination

30:13.801 --> 30:15.838
without his boss's approval?

30:15.903 --> 30:19.544
No, not without suffering
dire consequences.

30:19.607 --> 30:20.847
Did there come a time
when you observed

30:20.908 --> 30:23.013
Mr. Napoli in the
privacy of his home?

30:23.077 --> 30:26.718
Yes. The bureau had an apartment in a
high-rise across the street from him.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.124
And what did you observe?

30:28.182 --> 30:29.490
He talked to his family,

30:29.550 --> 30:33.430
read documents and what appeared
to be leather-bound record books.

30:33.488 --> 30:37.595
He received visitors and spoke to
them in an authoritative manner.

30:37.658 --> 30:39.001
Thank you.

30:39.393 --> 30:44.536
Agent Ruggiero, you couldn't
actually hear what he was saying,

30:44.599 --> 30:46.044
isn't that right?

30:46.100 --> 30:48.740
Yes. We didn't have
a bug in his home.

30:48.803 --> 30:49.838
Uh-huh.

30:49.904 --> 30:53.579
So as far as you know that, he
could've been speaking nonsense.

30:53.774 --> 30:56.050
And as for these record books,

30:56.110 --> 30:58.317
they could have
been photo albums?

30:59.580 --> 31:00.888
Yes.
Hmm.

31:01.149 --> 31:04.153
For the six months
that you watched my client,

31:04.552 --> 31:08.364
did you ever see him
speak to Mr. DeMayo?

31:08.990 --> 31:10.060
No.

31:10.191 --> 31:13.229
Or make a gesture
to him or wave hello?

31:13.294 --> 31:14.329
Not that I saw.

31:14.395 --> 31:17.342
Did you observe Mr. DeMayo
during that period

31:17.832 --> 31:20.472
ever perform any service
for my client?

31:21.302 --> 31:22.406
One time.

31:22.470 --> 31:23.881
Oh? What was that?

31:25.473 --> 31:27.214
He brought coffees to his car.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.346
He delivered coffees?

31:29.644 --> 31:30.816
(DOBBS CHUCKLES)

31:30.878 --> 31:36.055
And this is the man that my client
hired to kill Nick Lagrassa?

31:37.752 --> 31:40.733
Well, if that isn't proof that
he's mentally incompetent,

31:40.788 --> 31:42.597
I don't know what is.

31:43.057 --> 31:45.435
Thank you. No further
questions, Your Honor.

31:46.494 --> 31:49.270
Delivery boy. I brought
him coffee once.

31:49.330 --> 31:52.903
Get over it, Mr. DeMayo, or they'll
eat you alive on the stand.

31:52.967 --> 31:54.708
He's right, Johnny.

31:55.803 --> 31:57.680
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.

32:02.209 --> 32:04.348
Okay. I forgot.
Where were we?

32:04.412 --> 32:06.585
The question was,
please tell us what happened

32:06.647 --> 32:08.649
after you took
Mr. Lagrassa into the woods.

32:08.716 --> 32:10.093
Right, okay.

32:10.918 --> 32:12.693
I had him take off his clothes.

32:12.820 --> 32:14.595
Then I shot him
twice in the chest.

32:14.655 --> 32:15.998
He went...

32:16.457 --> 32:18.437
I meant, I let him
keep his boots

32:18.492 --> 32:20.768
then I shot him
twice in the chest.

32:20.828 --> 32:23.570
He went down.
I shot him four more times.

32:23.631 --> 32:24.803
I found a piece of rebar...

32:24.865 --> 32:26.344
JACK: Hold on.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.773
Did you memorize
your testimony?

32:28.836 --> 32:32.215
Yeah. So? I just want to
keep it straight in my head.

32:32.940 --> 32:36.046
Juries don't like witnesses
who sound rehearsed.

32:36.477 --> 32:38.286
If you leave something out,
just move on.

32:38.345 --> 32:40.450
I'll come back to it
in a follow-up question.

32:40.514 --> 32:42.551
Yeah. Okay.
Whatever you say.

32:43.217 --> 32:44.321
Good.

32:47.355 --> 32:52.134
Lagrassa had a large bruise on his right side.
Did you kick him?

32:52.893 --> 32:54.304
DEMAYO: A bruise?

32:55.363 --> 32:59.106
Oh, yeah, I kicked him.
I forgot that.

32:59.834 --> 33:02.280
All right.
9:00 a.m., Monday.

33:03.504 --> 33:05.245
Get plenty of rest.

33:15.316 --> 33:17.387
Lagrassa wasn't bruised.
Nope.

33:17.451 --> 33:20.227
DeMayo's lying.
He didn't kill Lagrassa.

33:20.288 --> 33:24.202
He got a contract from Napoli and had
somebody else do the dirty work?

33:24.258 --> 33:26.465
We got two days to find out.

33:27.795 --> 33:30.742
The John Doe who told DeMayo
the author was in town?

33:30.798 --> 33:32.209
Start there.

33:32.867 --> 33:35.871
Brendan Hall says only his
lawyer knew he was in town.

33:35.936 --> 33:38.940
He was pretty rabbity. Checked
in under an assumed name,

33:39.006 --> 33:42.283
would only talk to us with the lawyer,
and then only off the record.

33:42.343 --> 33:43.447
What was he worried about?

33:43.511 --> 33:45.513
I don't know. Process
servers for one thing.

33:45.579 --> 33:48.958
Guys who write tell-all books
tend to get sued a lot.

33:49.617 --> 33:50.960
Let's see.

33:58.225 --> 34:00.671
Hall, Brendan.

34:01.462 --> 34:03.373
Middle name?
Scott.

34:05.433 --> 34:06.741
(SIGHS)

34:06.801 --> 34:10.647
Here's one, it's about his Kennedy book.
Libel and defamation.

34:10.938 --> 34:14.750
$50 million! No wonder Hall
was keeping a low profile.

34:15.476 --> 34:16.784
Here's another lawsuit.

34:16.944 --> 34:18.389
Brendan Hall, Nicholas Lagrassa

34:18.446 --> 34:20.619
and Mattawin Publishing,
respondents.

34:20.681 --> 34:22.627
Look at the plaintiffs.
There must be 30 of them.

34:22.683 --> 34:25.596
Albanese, Andrea
Albanese, Julia.

34:26.152 --> 34:29.464
Disanto, Marie.
Macavoy, Diane.

34:30.357 --> 34:32.199
Call me crazy, but those
are the family names

34:32.259 --> 34:34.431
of the people Lagrassa killed.

34:34.895 --> 34:38.900
The suit alleges Lagrassa, Hall and the
publishers had made a contract for a book.

34:38.966 --> 34:41.572
The victim's families are suing
under the Son of Sam laws

34:41.635 --> 34:44.581
to collect whatever
Lagrassa was being paid.

34:44.638 --> 34:47.277
That opens up a whole
new universe of suspects.

34:47.875 --> 34:50.047
Oh, I think I might've
narrowed it down.

34:50.110 --> 34:53.420
17 years ago, Lagrassa killed the
owner of a sporting goods store,

34:53.481 --> 34:54.926
Sam Panetti.

34:54.982 --> 34:57.018
He owed money to
the wrong people.

34:57.083 --> 35:01.328
He was found shot dead. Stripped to his shorts.
His teeth knocked in.

35:01.722 --> 35:03.360
He has a daughter, Victoria.

35:03.691 --> 35:05.034
She's a plaintiff in the suit.

35:05.092 --> 35:06.537
Victoria. Vicky Grant?

35:06.594 --> 35:09.438
One and the same.
She could be our shooter.

35:11.332 --> 35:13.835
We can't let DeMayo
take the stand.

35:14.468 --> 35:16.846
If we ask for a delay, the
defense will smell trouble.

35:16.904 --> 35:18.247
It's that or suborning perjury

35:18.305 --> 35:19.841
if he testifies
he killed Lagrassa.

35:19.907 --> 35:21.113
I know.

35:22.977 --> 35:26.618
Talk to the other plaintiffs. See what
they have to say about Vicky Grant.

35:29.784 --> 35:33.891
Lagrassa killed my brother 'cause
he couldn't pay a gambling debt.

35:33.954 --> 35:36.059
ROSS: And now you
were suing him?

35:37.058 --> 35:41.029
The government gave him four
years for killing 23 people.

35:41.829 --> 35:44.605
Now they were gonna let him
write a book, make big money.

35:44.665 --> 35:47.202
What did Vicky Grant
think about it?

35:47.701 --> 35:50.238
She was 12 when
Lagrassa killed her dad.

35:50.638 --> 35:53.118
Our lawyer said it could take
years to find the money.

35:53.708 --> 35:55.483
(SIGHS) Vicky got fed up.
Dropped out of the suit.

35:55.543 --> 35:57.614
Did you know Hall was
meeting with Lagrassa?

35:57.678 --> 35:59.157
The book writer
comes from Australia.

35:59.213 --> 36:01.591
We'd been trying
to serve him papers.

36:01.649 --> 36:03.686
Our lawyer found out
he was gonna be in New York.

36:03.751 --> 36:05.628
Did Vicky know?
Sure.

36:06.020 --> 36:09.024
I told Marie Disanto, she told
Andrea Albanese, and like that.

36:09.090 --> 36:10.626
We all keep in touch.

36:11.358 --> 36:12.837
Why the emergency meeting?

36:12.893 --> 36:14.372
(TOILET FLUSHING)

36:14.428 --> 36:15.805
Hey, this better not
take all day.

36:15.863 --> 36:17.342
The pro bowl starts
in half an hour.

36:17.398 --> 36:19.002
Sit down.

36:19.066 --> 36:20.170
Hey, I got a big day tomorrow.

36:20.234 --> 36:21.474
If I want to relax,
I'm gonna relax.

36:21.535 --> 36:23.344
Shut up and sit down.

36:24.538 --> 36:26.313
What's got into him?

36:27.408 --> 36:29.285
You'd better sit down.

36:29.343 --> 36:31.653
You didn't shoot Nick Lagrassa!

36:32.913 --> 36:33.948
Well, then who did?

36:34.014 --> 36:35.015
ROSS: Vicky Grant.

36:35.082 --> 36:36.686
Vicky? Come on!

36:36.751 --> 36:39.493
She was at the restaurant.
The maitre d' identified her.

36:39.553 --> 36:41.863
When Lagrassa gave you the
slip, she followed him.

36:41.922 --> 36:44.528
JACK: Isn't that what
happened, Mr. DeMayo?

36:46.160 --> 36:48.436
Maybe you didn't
hear me the first time.

36:48.729 --> 36:51.539
You don't fill in the blanks, we're
throwing you out on the street.

36:51.599 --> 36:54.079
By the end of the day, you'll
be back where we found you,

36:54.135 --> 36:55.637
in a pool of your own blood.

36:55.703 --> 36:56.738
And if he talks?

36:56.804 --> 36:58.909
He remains a protected witness.

37:06.847 --> 37:08.224
Yeah, okay.

37:10.651 --> 37:13.689
She told me about that
writer coming to town.

37:15.923 --> 37:18.597
The idea was, we're gonna grab
Lagrassa, take him someplace,

37:18.659 --> 37:21.003
and then she was
gonna kill him.

37:21.061 --> 37:22.301
But things didn't
work out that way,

37:22.363 --> 37:24.502
and she took care
of it on her own.

37:25.499 --> 37:27.706
Then she came back to get me.

37:28.936 --> 37:30.847
I ditched the body,
and I got rid of her gun.

37:30.904 --> 37:33.851
And she let you take
the credit with Napoli?

37:34.642 --> 37:36.849
She didn't know about Napoli.

37:37.311 --> 37:38.847
Before all this happened,
I went to him,

37:38.912 --> 37:40.983
to get his okay on
killing Lagrassa.

37:41.048 --> 37:42.618
JACK: You wanted to
play the hero,

37:42.683 --> 37:45.027
the man who clipped
Nicky Shakes.

37:45.085 --> 37:46.393
I wanted respect.

37:46.587 --> 37:50.831
And you didn't tell Napoli that your
girlfriend was part of the plan?

37:57.498 --> 38:00.001
The police picked her up
20 minutes ago.

38:00.067 --> 38:01.808
This is a disaster.

38:02.703 --> 38:04.580
She's the shooter.

38:04.638 --> 38:07.744
Napoli didn't know. We can't
pin the murder on him.

38:07.808 --> 38:09.685
He did conspire
to kill Lagrassa.

38:09.743 --> 38:11.620
Yeah. According to who?

38:11.745 --> 38:15.750
DeMayo? The man perjured
himself before the grand jury.

38:15.816 --> 38:16.817
Some case.

38:16.884 --> 38:18.261
We might still
get a conviction.

38:18.319 --> 38:21.163
And Napoli might
get all of six years.

38:21.221 --> 38:24.395
I wanted him put behind
bars forever, for murder.

38:25.159 --> 38:27.765
The Feds will
laugh themselves silly.

38:30.097 --> 38:32.202
Johnny DeMayo gave you up.

38:32.266 --> 38:35.042
An eyewitness placed
you in the restaurant.

38:35.102 --> 38:38.174
By tomorrow, we'll have
recovered the weapon you used.

38:38.239 --> 38:41.118
You dragged her up here
to watch you beat your chest?

38:41.175 --> 38:43.177
We're prepared to be lenient.

38:43.244 --> 38:45.019
ROSS: You avenged your father.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.350
You couldn't stand the idea
Lagrassa might write a book

38:47.414 --> 38:48.984
and make money off his crimes.

38:49.049 --> 38:51.051
JACK: There's enough
mitigation here

38:51.118 --> 38:53.394
for a plea of
first-degree manslaughter.

38:54.255 --> 38:58.101
But we need you to testify
to it at Napoli's trial.

39:01.128 --> 39:03.438
You'll be in prison for a year.

39:04.598 --> 39:07.340
After that, you'll go into
Federal Witness Protection.

39:14.074 --> 39:15.212
(SIGHS)

39:15.276 --> 39:17.688
It wasn't
"might write a book."

39:18.612 --> 39:20.455
Lagrassa had
the book in his hand.

39:20.514 --> 39:23.324
He got it from the writer
in the restaurant.

39:24.018 --> 39:26.157
He said a book company
gave him nearly

39:26.220 --> 39:28.598
half a million dollars
for his story.

39:32.059 --> 39:34.164
He said he would
split it with me

39:34.495 --> 39:36.168
if I let him get away.

39:36.230 --> 39:37.641
You still have the draft?

39:41.935 --> 39:44.347
Someone else killed
Mr. Lagrassa?

39:45.005 --> 39:48.145
Was this woman also acting
on orders from Mr. Napoli?

39:48.208 --> 39:49.448
No.

39:49.510 --> 39:52.650
Ms. Grant was unaware
that Mr. Napoli was involved.

39:52.713 --> 39:54.715
Your Honor,
it sounds like my client

39:54.782 --> 39:56.728
is off the hook on
the murder charge.

39:56.784 --> 39:58.855
I'm moving to dismiss.

39:58.919 --> 40:01.331
I'm inclined to
agree, Mr. McCoy.

40:02.156 --> 40:05.365
The charges against Mr. Napoli
can't be sustained.

40:06.026 --> 40:08.939
Unless Ms. Grant was
a part of his conspiracy.

40:08.996 --> 40:12.534
(LAUGHS) How could she? Neither of
them knew the other was involved.

40:12.599 --> 40:14.272
People v. Treuber.

40:15.035 --> 40:19.575
Ms. Grant made an agreement with
Mr. DeMayo to kill Lagrassa,

40:20.441 --> 40:24.116
and Mr. DeMayo made one with Napoli.
That's a conspiracy.

40:24.178 --> 40:27.421
The fact that the right hand didn't know
what the left was doing is immaterial.

40:27.481 --> 40:29.825
Treuber?
You have the cite?

40:30.284 --> 40:34.198
Your Honor, it's too late for
Mr. McCoy to amend the indictment.

40:34.254 --> 40:36.564
Ms. Grant isn't named
as a conspirator.

40:36.623 --> 40:37.966
Yes, she is.

40:38.025 --> 40:39.732
As the John Doe
co-conspirator

40:39.793 --> 40:42.399
who gave information to
DeMayo about Mr. Hall.

40:42.463 --> 40:44.602
Ms. Grant has
agreed to testify?

40:44.665 --> 40:46.269
JACK: Yes, Your Honor.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.046
Have her in my
courtroom tomorrow.

40:49.636 --> 40:52.014
I'm denying your
motion to dismiss.

40:54.508 --> 40:56.249
Judge Larkin went for it.

40:56.310 --> 40:59.621
We've gotta have Vicky Grant
prepped for tomorrow morning.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.786
I've been reading Lagrassa
and Hall's masterpiece.

41:02.850 --> 41:06.593
I'll wait for the movie. You
don't want to wait that long.

41:08.155 --> 41:10.499
GRANT: Lagrassa begged
me for his life.

41:11.191 --> 41:12.966
He offered me money.

41:15.295 --> 41:16.968
I got in his face.

41:18.465 --> 41:20.376
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

41:23.003 --> 41:25.984
I told him that I was
the daughter of Sam Panetti,

41:27.307 --> 41:31.050
and I shot him,
like the dog that he was.

41:32.012 --> 41:33.252
And then?

41:33.514 --> 41:34.788
I broke his teeth,

41:35.749 --> 41:37.990
just like he did to my father.

41:42.389 --> 41:44.699
I went back to look for Johnny.

41:45.526 --> 41:49.474
That idiot was still at the restaurant.
We drove to the park.

41:51.231 --> 41:53.370
He put the body in the lake.

41:54.434 --> 41:57.415
I gave him my gun, and he
dropped me off at the subway.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.109
And what did you
do with the book?

41:59.173 --> 42:00.652
I kept it.

42:02.976 --> 42:04.614
People's 64, Your Honor.

42:08.315 --> 42:11.524
Is this the manuscript
you took from Mr. Lagrassa?

42:11.852 --> 42:13.263
Yes, it is.

42:14.655 --> 42:19.070
"“Mob Life by Nicholas
Lagrassa with Brendan Hall."

42:20.594 --> 42:23.939
I'd like you to read
the passage I marked.

42:25.466 --> 42:26.843
(SIGHS)

42:30.837 --> 42:33.579
"When Joey's brother
came out of Attica,"

42:34.274 --> 42:37.346
"Joey wanted to set him up
in his own business."

42:38.078 --> 42:40.388
"His brother liked sports"

42:40.447 --> 42:43.587
"so a sporting goods store
seemed like a natural."

42:44.351 --> 42:47.423
"Panetti's on Atlantic Avenue
owed us 20 bills."

42:48.722 --> 42:50.633
"We called in the note."

42:52.459 --> 42:53.665
"Mr."

42:56.597 --> 42:58.543
(CRYING)
"Panetti was found dead"

42:59.933 --> 43:03.210
"in Prospect Park
by a man walking his dog."

43:06.740 --> 43:09.619
And Mr. Panetti
was your father?

43:11.411 --> 43:12.515
Yes.

43:16.016 --> 43:17.222
This

43:18.352 --> 43:21.128
bastard Lagrassa,

43:22.656 --> 43:25.660
they were gonna put
him on Larry King,

43:27.060 --> 43:30.530
get a big-name actor
to play him in a movie

43:31.665 --> 43:33.804
and make a hero out of him.

43:35.335 --> 43:39.841
A piece of dirt
like Nick Lagrassa.

43:42.409 --> 43:46.414
These wiseguys,
they are psychos and losers,

43:47.314 --> 43:49.351
and everybody loves them.

43:51.852 --> 43:53.627
And I don't get it.

44:03.163 --> 44:04.972
I'd like you to read

44:07.167 --> 44:08.840
one more passage.

44:13.874 --> 44:18.721
"Joey and I were at Stark's
Restaurant with Al Napoli

44:19.980 --> 44:23.518
"when we heard the Feds popped
Frank Masucci for murder.

44:24.718 --> 44:26.925
"Al said..."
Objection, Your Honor.

44:26.987 --> 44:28.091
Hearsay.

44:28.155 --> 44:31.625
LARKIN: No. I'm going to allow it.
The objection is overruled.

44:32.459 --> 44:34.029
Go ahead, Ms. Grant.

44:35.195 --> 44:36.367
(SIGHS)

44:36.630 --> 44:40.100
"Al said Masucci
should claim insanity,"

44:41.101 --> 44:44.082
"like John Hinckley,
the man who shot Reagan."

44:45.072 --> 44:47.746
"Al said that's what
he'd do if he got arrested,"

44:47.808 --> 44:49.310
"a crazy act."

44:54.981 --> 44:56.324
Thank you.

45:00.153 --> 45:03.930
Two hours to return a guilty verdict.
Must be some kind of record.

45:04.591 --> 45:07.333
We'd like to talk about a
sentence recommendation.

45:07.394 --> 45:09.032
He was convicted of murder one.

45:09.096 --> 45:11.667
First he serves life,
then we can talk.

45:12.566 --> 45:15.547
And if my client had
some information to offer?

45:15.769 --> 45:17.806
About?
The five families,

45:18.405 --> 45:22.046
the Russian mob, Chinese,
Jamaican, the whole melting pot.

45:23.710 --> 45:25.087
What kind of time
are you looking for?

45:25.145 --> 45:26.453
No time.

45:26.613 --> 45:28.889
He goes straight
into Witness Protection.

45:28.949 --> 45:30.792
I mean, Adam Schiff'll be
prosecuting cases

45:30.851 --> 45:32.592
for the next 10 years
on his testimony.

45:32.653 --> 45:34.690
I'm not giving him a walk.

45:38.525 --> 45:42.166
One year. Somewhere near the city.
He has grandchildren.

45:42.229 --> 45:43.367
Two.

45:44.965 --> 45:46.376
Two years?

45:49.503 --> 45:51.483
Maybe I'll write a book.

45:57.144 --> 45:59.249
In the end, they all
rat each other out.

45:59.312 --> 46:01.758
And we all end up paying
their living expenses.

46:01.815 --> 46:03.988
Or buying their memoirs.

46:04.050 --> 46:07.088
Time to share the good news.
Happy faces, everybody.

46:09.356 --> 46:10.699
WOMAN: All right.

46:10.757 --> 46:12.259
WOMAN 2: Mr. Schiff.
Mr. Schiff.

46:12.325 --> 46:16.102
Can you comment?
Mr. Schiff. Sir. Sir.

46:17.305 --> 46:23.167
