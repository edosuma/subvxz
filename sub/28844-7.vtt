00:06.620 --> 00:10.965
[soft atmospheric music]

00:28.275 --> 00:31.172
- What's going on?
Is there a problem?

00:31.241 --> 00:33.551
- Are there problems?

00:33.620 --> 00:36.413
Everywhere I turn, son.

00:36.482 --> 00:38.689
- So where you headed
- You know,

00:38.758 --> 00:41.793
the only time I'm solely
focused on the present

00:41.862 --> 00:44.379
is on this horse.

00:44.448 --> 00:46.000
Just need a long ride
to remind myself

00:46.068 --> 00:47.034
of what we're fighting for.

00:47.103 --> 00:50.482
- Want some company?

00:50.551 --> 00:53.551
- You have a few problems that
need fixing first, I'm afraid.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.724
- Well, ain't that the thing
about problems, Dad?

00:55.793 --> 00:57.724
No matter how long
you're gone,

00:57.793 --> 00:59.241
they'll be right here
when you get back.

01:03.275 --> 01:05.896
- Grab a horse.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.034
- Well, I just
got to find someone

01:07.103 --> 01:09.862
to watch Tate real quick.

01:09.931 --> 01:12.413
- I'll wait for you out here.

01:12.482 --> 01:15.241
- You don't got to wait on me.
I'll catch up.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.896
- You think, do you?

01:16.965 --> 01:19.137
- Just tell me what
direction you're headed.

01:21.137 --> 01:23.068
[chuckles]

02:28.172 --> 02:29.620
Come here much?

02:29.689 --> 02:32.000
- Every chance I get.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.206
- It's been 20 years.

02:34.275 --> 02:38.862
- No. 21.

02:38.931 --> 02:42.137
21 years and it
feels like yesterday.

02:43.379 --> 02:47.172
I still feel her,
smell her.

02:50.724 --> 02:52.482
Been half a man without her.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.206
It's not an excuse.

02:56.275 --> 02:58.241
I was just a better father
when she was with me.

03:03.482 --> 03:06.103
I hope you never know
what that feels like, son.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.965
- I already know
what it feels like.

03:16.172 --> 03:20.103
[theme music]

04:20.206 --> 04:22.067
- Thing's getting
so dry today.

04:22.137 --> 04:27.034
[men chatter]

04:31.620 --> 04:32.862
- That's disgusting.

04:32.931 --> 04:34.413
- Open that curtain, Graham.
Wake his ass up.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.931
Tate, what are you doing here?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.965
- Dad went off with Grandpa.

04:38.034 --> 04:39.448
Told me to stay here.

04:39.517 --> 04:40.724
- I guess your dad
forgot what here's like.

04:40.793 --> 04:43.103
Let's go. Come on.

04:46.206 --> 04:48.482
[crying]

04:58.620 --> 05:00.379
- I blame myself.

05:02.689 --> 05:04.379
To a degree.

05:06.724 --> 05:10.379
You know what's so dangerous
about you, Jamie?

05:10.448 --> 05:13.517
You justify every act
before you commit them.

05:16.068 --> 05:19.172
You're consumed with
the world's perception of you.

05:23.275 --> 05:25.034
What kind of man I am,

05:25.103 --> 05:28.103
that's not a question
you ever ask yourself.

05:29.931 --> 05:31.517
What does the world
think of me,

05:31.586 --> 05:35.827
that's the only
question you ask.

05:35.896 --> 05:40.517
Morality, loyalty,

05:40.586 --> 05:44.000
not part of the equation
for you.

05:44.068 --> 05:46.896
But you've finally
done something

05:46.965 --> 05:50.034
that makes you see yourself
the way the world does.

05:57.862 --> 06:01.241
The way I see you.

06:01.310 --> 06:03.551
The way he sees you.

06:06.344 --> 06:09.827
And no amount of scrubbing
is going to change that.

06:18.655 --> 06:21.241
I got to tell you something

06:21.310 --> 06:23.448
and it comes
from a place of love.

06:26.655 --> 06:29.758
You should really consider
killing yourself.

06:44.482 --> 06:46.241
- Never seen anything like it.

06:46.310 --> 06:47.931
- That's saying a lot, Ben.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.689
Got an ID on the victim?

06:49.758 --> 06:52.137
- Dave Blackbull.

06:52.206 --> 06:54.206
- From the casino?

06:54.275 --> 06:56.068
What happened?

06:56.137 --> 06:57.586
- You got to see it.

06:57.655 --> 06:59.724
- What's the cause of death?

06:59.793 --> 07:01.275
- He was strangled.

07:01.344 --> 07:02.551
- You've seen that before.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.862
- More times
than I care to count.

07:09.275 --> 07:11.034
- Why is there blood?

07:11.103 --> 07:13.034
- Yeah. This I haven't seen.

07:21.448 --> 07:23.379
You know what
that looks like to me?

07:27.586 --> 07:29.586
- A message.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.344
- My dad used to do this.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.482
- Oh, yeah?

07:38.551 --> 07:39.862
- When he breaks colts,
he does it.

07:39.931 --> 07:42.000
- Yeah?
- Why do you do it?

07:42.068 --> 07:43.655
- Well, I want to get
all the shit out of his system

07:43.724 --> 07:45.034
so I can get on him.

07:45.103 --> 07:46.275
- You owe me a dollar!

07:46.344 --> 07:48.137
- I ain't paying
you a fuckin' dollar.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.793
- So you don't
go ass over teakettle?

07:50.862 --> 07:52.655
- [chuckles]
Yeah, that's right.

07:52.724 --> 07:56.862
Here, here, here, here...
Here.

08:00.172 --> 08:04.172
See that, Tate?
That's him submitting.

08:04.241 --> 08:05.724
- What does that mean?

08:05.793 --> 08:10.103
- That means he's ready
to go to work.

08:10.172 --> 08:13.689
Hold on. Go nice and easy.

08:13.758 --> 08:16.620
You can pet his face now.

08:16.689 --> 08:18.586
There you go.
Right up...there you go.

08:18.655 --> 08:22.655
That's a good boy.

08:22.724 --> 08:24.172
Yeah.

08:24.241 --> 08:25.517
All right, what do you say?

08:25.586 --> 08:27.206
Should we get another one?
- Yeah.

08:27.275 --> 08:28.689
- Go get the gate for me.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.758
Whoa, whoa.

08:39.655 --> 08:41.965
You can add babysitting
to my list of talents.

08:42.034 --> 08:45.724
- Got to say, I didn't
see that one coming.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.620
- Me neither.

08:48.689 --> 08:50.206
- We need to talk.
- Yes, sir.

08:50.275 --> 08:52.551
- I need to talk
to you first, Grandpa.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.206
It's very serious.

08:54.275 --> 08:55.551
- All right.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.206
- Do I need to be part
of this conversation?

08:57.275 --> 08:59.275
- You ain't got any money.
Gotta be him.

09:03.758 --> 09:07.448
- This should be good.
Come on.

09:07.517 --> 09:10.172
- Thanks for watching him.

09:10.241 --> 09:13.448
- He's a smart kid.
You can see it in his eyes.

09:13.517 --> 09:15.517
- Got that from his mother.

09:15.586 --> 09:17.137
- Yeah, kind of figured.

09:17.206 --> 09:18.793
- All right, grandson,
let me have it.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.000
- So I've made a decision.

09:21.068 --> 09:23.241
- Is that a fact?

09:23.310 --> 09:26.551
- I'm going to be a cowboy.

09:26.620 --> 09:27.931
- Well, that's a good thing.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.344
This ranch needs you to be one.

09:30.413 --> 09:33.655
Someday this is all...
all gonna be yours.

09:36.517 --> 09:38.827
- Well, that brings me
to my problem.

09:38.896 --> 09:40.413
- Okay.

09:40.482 --> 09:42.689
- I don't have a horse.

09:42.758 --> 09:45.586
I can't be a cowboy
without a horse.

09:45.655 --> 09:49.275
- Yeah. Pretty tough
to cowboy without a horse,

09:49.344 --> 09:50.827
that's for sure.

09:50.896 --> 09:53.689
- So can you buy me one?

09:53.758 --> 09:56.758
- Well, if I buy it,
how you gonna pay me back?

09:56.827 --> 10:00.551
- I'll clean out the stalls
or sweep out the barn.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.655
- Well, that's a start.

10:02.724 --> 10:04.344
Your dad's gonna
have to train it.

10:04.413 --> 10:05.827
Because I don't have time
for that shit anymore.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.758
Who's gonna feed it?

10:07.827 --> 10:09.586
- Um, I...I will.

10:09.655 --> 10:11.827
- Okay. You don't,
it don't eat.

10:11.896 --> 10:14.000
You don't water it,
it doesn't drink.

10:14.068 --> 10:15.655
I don't want to have
to hear otherwise.

10:15.724 --> 10:17.344
You understand?

10:17.413 --> 10:19.241
- So is that a yes?

10:19.310 --> 10:21.172
- If it's a yes
from your father,

10:21.241 --> 10:22.448
it's a yes from me.

10:24.172 --> 10:26.379
- Daddy! Daddy!

10:26.448 --> 10:27.620
You gotta train my horse!

10:38.517 --> 10:39.551
- Can I help you, sir?

10:39.620 --> 10:42.931
- I'm sure you can.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.862
Dan Jenkins,

10:45.931 --> 10:48.206
your liquor license
has been suspended

10:48.275 --> 10:50.034
until your revocation hearing.

10:50.103 --> 10:51.379
- And when is that?

10:51.448 --> 10:53.827
- Well, the Liquor Control Board

10:53.896 --> 10:57.620
has recessed until next year.
So we should be

10:57.689 --> 11:00.310
able to get something
on the books by spring.

11:00.379 --> 11:02.344
- We need to confiscate
all alcohol from the premises.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.310
- Of course, you do.

11:18.034 --> 11:19.379
- Uh, Beth...

11:19.448 --> 11:20.896
- What time is my conference
call with Mountain West?

11:20.965 --> 11:23.689
- 11:30. Beth...

11:23.758 --> 11:25.103
- Who's that?

11:25.172 --> 11:26.758
- It's Malcolm Beck.

11:26.827 --> 11:29.310
- [sigh]

11:29.379 --> 11:31.448
Coffee.

11:31.517 --> 11:33.241
- Okay.

11:33.310 --> 11:36.724
- Not for him, Jason.
For me.

11:36.793 --> 11:39.379
- Right...

11:39.448 --> 11:40.896
- I have a full day.

11:40.965 --> 11:42.344
If you'd like
to make an appointment,

11:42.413 --> 11:45.068
I'll have my assistant
schedule one.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.620
- This won't take long at all.

11:51.448 --> 11:53.068
You're buying up quite the...

11:53.137 --> 11:54.862
swath of land
here in the valley.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.103
- You're a long way
from Billings,

11:56.172 --> 11:57.689
aren't you, Malcolm?

11:57.758 --> 12:00.448
- I don't consider any part
of this state beyond my reach.

12:00.517 --> 12:03.724
- Not sure the state would
agree with you on that, buddy.

12:03.793 --> 12:05.241
- Hmm.

12:05.310 --> 12:08.103
Your father is...

12:08.172 --> 12:10.413
is not a reasonable man.

12:10.482 --> 12:15.068
I respect that.
I'm not either.

12:15.137 --> 12:18.275
So I want to be clear
about something.

12:18.344 --> 12:22.137
I will not have a casino built
at the gates of Yellowstone.

12:22.206 --> 12:24.482
- Oh, we don't want one either.

12:24.551 --> 12:26.586
- But you won't
help me stop them.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.034
- I'd go back to Billings,
Malcolm.

12:32.103 --> 12:33.517
We'll take it from here.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.448
- Huh.

12:35.517 --> 12:38.413
You see, I just can't...

12:38.482 --> 12:41.896
I can't trust that
you will stop them.

12:41.965 --> 12:44.137
Your family has
the political resources

12:44.206 --> 12:45.965
to guarantee this
build never happens.

12:46.034 --> 12:47.793
And yet you won't offer them.

12:47.862 --> 12:51.551
- I think my father's reputation

12:51.620 --> 12:54.724
should warrant a little trust.

12:54.793 --> 12:58.551
- The only thing he cares about
is his ranch.

12:58.620 --> 13:01.379
Now when that property
tax quadruples,

13:01.448 --> 13:03.344
the only way he'll
be able to protect it

13:03.413 --> 13:05.344
is find a new revenue stream.

13:05.413 --> 13:07.275
- That's my job.

13:07.344 --> 13:08.758
- I'm well aware of that.

13:08.827 --> 13:11.482
I'm also aware
that the likeliest

13:11.551 --> 13:13.448
source of electricity
for the casino

13:13.517 --> 13:16.689
comes from damming
your tributary.

13:16.758 --> 13:19.034
Now your father may
not have thought about that,

13:19.103 --> 13:21.724
but I guarantee you have.

13:21.793 --> 13:24.000
And I am positive that pretty
face has done the math

13:24.068 --> 13:26.724
figuring out how much
money you will make

13:26.793 --> 13:30.344
turning the Dutton ranch
into the Dutton Power Company.

13:34.620 --> 13:37.172
Do you know the story
of Susan Rawlings?

13:37.241 --> 13:39.827
- Real estate attorney
from Hamilton.

13:39.896 --> 13:41.482
- That's right.

13:41.551 --> 13:44.241
We had a mutually
beneficial relationship

13:44.310 --> 13:46.862
until she figured out
a way to bend the law

13:46.931 --> 13:50.689
to benefit her business
more than my business.

13:52.034 --> 13:55.862
That's the problem
with playing dirty, Beth.

13:55.931 --> 13:57.931
Because when someone
plays dirty back,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.448
there's no one to cry to.

13:59.517 --> 14:00.965
There's no charges to file.

14:01.034 --> 14:03.275
There's nowhere to scream about
the injustice you endured.

14:03.344 --> 14:05.172
Because if you do,

14:05.241 --> 14:09.034
all your filthy laundry
just spills right out

14:09.103 --> 14:12.896
in the open
for everyone to see.

14:12.965 --> 14:15.862
Susan finally realized that.

14:15.931 --> 14:18.827
We moved her
somewhere in California

14:18.896 --> 14:22.034
where they could help
her move past the trauma.

14:24.103 --> 14:26.689
It's uncanny how much
you look like her.

14:29.965 --> 14:32.206
- You know,
I was a pretty bad teenager.

14:34.965 --> 14:38.172
Working through
some trauma of my own.

14:38.241 --> 14:42.103
One might say I had
a tendency to "act out".

14:43.379 --> 14:44.482
At church one Sunday,

14:44.551 --> 14:46.758
I was feeling
a little naughty

14:46.827 --> 14:50.206
sitting next to this skinny
little boy nobody liked.

14:53.137 --> 14:56.482
Out of pity, or boredom,

14:56.551 --> 14:59.620
I unzipped his slacks.

14:59.689 --> 15:00.931
I pulled out his penis

15:01.000 --> 15:05.103
and I gave him a hand job
in the back pew.

15:05.172 --> 15:09.034
It's uncanny how much you
look like that boy's dick.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.517
- All that tough talk, Beth.

15:12.586 --> 15:15.931
I got the cure for that.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.724
We'll see how tough you are
after I give it to you.

15:20.655 --> 15:22.034
- Challenge accepted.

15:23.310 --> 15:25.620
- Ma'am.

15:36.344 --> 15:38.758
- I'll feed it every day,
I'll brush it every day.

15:38.827 --> 15:40.620
I'll bathe it every day.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.275
I'll even learn how to braid,
so I can braid it.

15:43.344 --> 15:44.896
I'll ride it to school,

15:44.965 --> 15:46.793
I'll ride it every morning.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.310
And I'll muck its stall out.

15:48.379 --> 15:50.655
I'll even clean out his poop.

15:50.724 --> 15:52.620
This is gonna be awesome!

15:52.689 --> 15:54.689
It might be a paint.

15:54.758 --> 15:57.862
It might be a buckskin,
an appaloosa.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.586
If it's blue,
I'll name it Blue.

15:59.655 --> 16:01.068
If it's red,
I'll name it Red.

16:01.137 --> 16:02.931
If it's a girl, I'll name it...
- Oh, my God, son.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.793
I'm gonna help you train
the horse, okay?

16:04.862 --> 16:06.413
I'll train it during the week

16:06.482 --> 16:08.931
and then I'll teach you
on the weekends.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.206
- Grandpa said I need
to feed it every day.

16:11.275 --> 16:12.896
So I have to live
on the ranch with you.

16:12.965 --> 16:16.551
- Shh. Quiet.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.517
Can't let your mother
hear you talking like that.

16:19.862 --> 16:22.000
- No, he's right.
He should live on the ranch.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.862
- Now you done it.

16:32.586 --> 16:34.068
Hey...

16:38.655 --> 16:41.206
Where you going?

16:41.275 --> 16:44.241
- Depends.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.413
- On what?

16:46.482 --> 16:47.827
- You.

16:47.896 --> 16:49.137
- How does it depend on me?

16:51.586 --> 16:53.068
- Why don't you go to your
room for a minute, okay?

17:02.931 --> 17:06.448
I--I've tried to
move on from you.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.205
Tried to get closure, but...

17:14.068 --> 17:17.275
there's no such thing.
You're...

17:17.344 --> 17:20.896
You're a part of me.

17:20.964 --> 17:23.344
You're a part of my soul.

17:23.413 --> 17:25.241
And I just hope
you'll forgive me...

17:32.862 --> 17:35.482
- Gross! Stop!

17:35.551 --> 17:36.827
[laughter]

17:36.896 --> 17:39.517
- You're gonna make a baby.
I know it.

18:02.965 --> 18:04.551
- Rip!

18:14.206 --> 18:16.241
- Sir, I don't think
he would have walked this way.

18:20.241 --> 18:21.965
- How much of it did you do?

18:22.034 --> 18:23.724
- I mean,
I can't talk about that.

18:23.793 --> 18:25.448
It would make you an accessory.

18:25.517 --> 18:28.517
- Oh, you're a lawyer now,
Rip?

18:28.586 --> 18:30.827
All it makes me is
an accessory after the fact.

18:30.896 --> 18:34.034
I'll take those odds.

18:34.103 --> 18:36.275
- Well, I didn't do any of it.

18:36.344 --> 18:37.482
I just tried to
make it go away.

18:39.724 --> 18:41.448
- This ain't ever going away.

18:41.517 --> 18:44.103
- No, sir.
I don't think it will.

18:44.172 --> 18:47.655
Sir? Sir?

18:51.482 --> 18:53.448
- Wait here.

19:41.413 --> 19:45.448
You know the thing
about suicide...

19:45.517 --> 19:48.241
you don't just
kill yourself.

19:48.310 --> 19:51.103
You kill every memory of you.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.793
This'll be all everyone
remembers, Jamie.

19:58.689 --> 20:01.586
Every second you spent
on this earth

20:01.655 --> 20:05.793
will be reduced
to how you chose to leave it.

20:05.862 --> 20:07.482
No one will mourn your loss,
son,

20:07.551 --> 20:10.000
because this
isn't losing your life.

20:10.068 --> 20:11.655
This is quitting it.

20:11.724 --> 20:16.448
- Yes, it's quitting.
I quit, Dad.

20:16.517 --> 20:18.137
- I won't let you.

20:18.206 --> 20:20.068
- Why not?
What do you care?

20:20.137 --> 20:23.448
- Because it's selfish!

20:23.517 --> 20:26.344
It's the single most selfish
thing a person can do!

20:27.896 --> 20:32.206
- This cannot be fixed.

20:32.275 --> 20:36.413
I cannot...be fixed.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.931
I'm married to it.

20:52.241 --> 20:55.206
- Your grandfather
used to say that you...

20:55.275 --> 20:59.620
that you can't fix
a broken wagon wheel.

20:59.689 --> 21:01.827
But you can use the parts
to make a new one.

21:05.137 --> 21:08.620
I should have never
sent you off to school.

21:08.689 --> 21:10.310
You needed more time here.

21:10.379 --> 21:13.758
I can--I can
still give you that.

21:15.827 --> 21:19.827
But you need to give me
that rifle, son.

21:19.896 --> 21:22.206
The old you is dead
the moment you let it go.

21:50.965 --> 21:53.413
Now we start working
on the new one.

22:10.482 --> 22:12.241
[door slams]

22:12.310 --> 22:15.655
- Beth?

22:15.724 --> 22:17.965
- Yeah?

22:19.206 --> 22:21.344
- You need to go easy
on your brother.

22:21.413 --> 22:22.931
- I always go easy on him.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.413
- Your other brother.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.482
- I can't do that.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.344
- Beth, I need you to set aside
whatever it is...

22:34.413 --> 22:36.965
- Dad, when you asked me to stay
and fight for this family,

22:37.034 --> 22:40.931
you said fight everyone.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.551
I know you don't want
to see it, Dad,

22:42.620 --> 22:45.068
but he's the one we should
be fighting the hardest.

22:46.931 --> 22:48.965
- He was gonna
kill himself today.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.206
- Well, give me a week,

22:50.275 --> 22:51.344
and I'll have him ready
to see it through.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.482
- I don't want him
to see it through!

22:56.000 --> 22:59.068
- Look me in the eye
and tell me that you love him.

23:02.551 --> 23:06.034
Love.

23:06.103 --> 23:08.172
What you feel for Kayce.

23:10.137 --> 23:12.896
What you feel for me.

23:32.896 --> 23:35.379
- This is silly.

23:35.448 --> 23:36.413
- Come on.

23:47.965 --> 23:51.068
- Just do me one hand,
just one time...

23:51.137 --> 23:53.448
- Okay. Um...

23:53.517 --> 23:56.206
- Yeah! Damn, all right.

23:57.655 --> 23:59.206
- Looking for a bunk?

23:59.275 --> 24:01.448
- The lawyer's gonna try
his hand at cowboying, Lloyd.

24:01.517 --> 24:03.862
- Bet's to you.
Ten to play...

24:07.827 --> 24:10.103

24:13.034 --> 24:15.068
All right, come on.

24:18.896 --> 24:20.827
- Let's see the last card.

24:20.896 --> 24:22.689
- Yeah, flip 'em.

[chatter]

24:27.344 --> 24:30.827
[laughter]

24:30.896 --> 24:33.827

to deal you in?

24:33.896 --> 24:36.034
- What's the...

24:36.103 --> 24:37.517
What's the buy?

24:37.586 --> 24:39.517
- Whoah!
- Twenties!

24:39.586 --> 24:42.241
- We're just working
girls here, huh?

24:42.310 --> 24:43.413
Well, I mean,
you shave your nuts.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.172
- You shave your nuts, bro.

24:45.241 --> 24:46.344
- Yeah, with your razor.

24:46.413 --> 24:49.275
That's what men do.

24:49.344 --> 24:51.000
Everyone's good?

24:51.068 --> 24:53.172
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm!

24:53.241 --> 24:55.724
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

24:55.793 --> 24:57.275
- Check.

24:57.344 --> 25:01.310
- In, in, in...

25:01.379 --> 25:02.620
- Let's go.
- Hmm.

25:02.689 --> 25:04.344
- Don't have to tell you, Jamie.

25:04.413 --> 25:06.000
- Sure.

25:06.068 --> 25:07.827
- He calls?
- Ooh!

25:07.896 --> 25:09.413
- I do have one of those.

25:09.482 --> 25:11.758
- All right, here comes
the turn...

25:11.827 --> 25:15.137
Ohh.

25:15.206 --> 25:17.793
- Bet's to you, Ethan.
- All in.

25:17.862 --> 25:19.862
- Bet's to you.

25:23.379 --> 25:25.517
- I fold.

25:25.586 --> 25:26.862
- Yeah, you made
the right decision.

25:26.931 --> 25:29.137
- I know.

25:29.206 --> 25:30.896
- You're gonna do fine, Jamie.

25:44.137 --> 25:46.103
- Need one?

25:46.172 --> 25:49.172
- No.

25:49.241 --> 25:52.896
- You think it's a problem
for you? Alcohol?

25:52.965 --> 25:55.551
- It's not a problem.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.758
I just don't like
doing anything halfway.

25:57.827 --> 26:00.172
- I'm not sure what that means.

26:00.241 --> 26:01.689
- It means if
I'm drinking tequila,

26:01.758 --> 26:04.310
I'm eating the fuckin' worm.

26:04.379 --> 26:05.620
- [chuckles]

26:05.689 --> 26:09.172
- I don't think you
want to see that, Dad.

26:09.241 --> 26:11.034
- Oh, God, Beth.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.758
You would have made
a hell of a cowboy.

26:16.931 --> 26:19.275
- Malcolm Beck
came to visit me today.

26:24.310 --> 26:25.724
- What'd he want?

26:28.965 --> 26:31.586
- Men like him,
they just want to be feared.

26:35.310 --> 26:37.034
- Well, he ain't getting that.

26:39.793 --> 26:42.137
- No, sir.

26:48.172 --> 26:50.931
But he's gonna try.

26:54.448 --> 26:56.620
Goodnight, Daddy.
