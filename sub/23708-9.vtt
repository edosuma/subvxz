WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.968
An epic fight for power
gives rise to

00:04.004 --> 00:05.937
a legendary queen.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.939
ALCOCK: Cleopatra knew that

00:08.008 --> 00:09.908
the only weapons she had
at her disposal

00:10.043 --> 00:12.177
were her wit and her charm.

00:12.246 --> 00:15.447
An amazing balloon race
for the record books.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.783
GARVER: This was
the worst-case scenario.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.252
They were basically stranded.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.522
And a strange house
that defies the laws
of gravity.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.959
CAIN BIANCO: They felt
symptoms -- dizziness, nausea.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.060
It was odd.

00:29.096 --> 00:32.564
These are the mysteries
at the museum.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.840
Montana was created
in 1864

00:41.975 --> 00:45.277
when President Abraham Lincoln
signed into law an act

00:45.412 --> 00:48.280
that divided up lands
that were previously part

00:48.282 --> 00:50.682
of the Dakota Territory.

00:50.785 --> 00:53.185
And on the Big Sky State's
eastern border

00:53.254 --> 00:55.454
in the town of Sidney
is an institution

00:55.589 --> 00:58.022
that celebrates the history
of the region --

00:58.058 --> 01:00.492
the MonDak Heritage Center.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.965
Documenting everyday life
as it was lived

01:07.067 --> 01:09.367
on the Western Frontier,
the collection includes

01:09.437 --> 01:12.905
an array of cattle brands
dating back to the 19th century,

01:13.040 --> 01:16.074
a bank safe from 1906,

01:16.177 --> 01:19.410
and a Ford Model N,
one of the nation's

01:19.447 --> 01:21.880
first mass-produced automobiles.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.519
But one item here looks
like it belongs

01:27.555 --> 01:30.555
not in a museum
but in a kitchen.

01:30.624 --> 01:34.126
The artifact is about the size
and shape of a shoebox.

01:34.228 --> 01:37.195
It stands on four legs,
and in the front

01:37.231 --> 01:39.531
is a small knob.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.400
The top opens up like a book,
and on the inside

01:42.436 --> 01:45.537
are a series of circular
indentations.

01:45.573 --> 01:49.407
WILDMAN: This culinary device
is used to make

01:49.543 --> 01:52.144
one of the world's
tastiest treats,

01:52.246 --> 01:56.147
but few know the high seas
ordeal behind its origins.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.485
PORGES: This is a story
of a young sailor,

01:59.587 --> 02:01.686
a culinary conundrum,

02:01.755 --> 02:04.556
and a delicious discovery.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.898
WILDMAN:
It's the 1840s in Maine.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.633
Sixteen-year-old sailor,
Hanson Gregory,

02:15.669 --> 02:17.435
is getting ready
for his next voyage

02:17.505 --> 02:21.139
on a schooner transporting
limestone down the East Coast.

02:21.175 --> 02:24.075
Gregory was ambitious,
he was young,

02:24.144 --> 02:25.910
but he had experience
under his belt,

02:25.946 --> 02:28.247
and he was excited
to get out on the sea.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.386
WILDMAN: Before he departs,
the young seaman's mother

02:34.488 --> 02:37.255
puts together for her sun
a care package

02:37.324 --> 02:41.527
containing his favorite snack --
fried cakes filled with nuts.

02:41.629 --> 02:45.463
But after several weeks at sea,
the delicious cakes

02:45.533 --> 02:48.166
are all gone.

02:48.269 --> 02:52.337
So, as the story goes,
Gregory comes up with a plan.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.140
He'll make some more himself
in the ship's galley

02:55.142 --> 02:57.342
and share them
with his crewmates.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.878
PORGES: This was a great plan.
He could surprise his crewmates,

02:59.947 --> 03:02.748
everybody would love it.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.817
WILDMAN: He prepares everything

03:05.819 --> 03:08.186
according to
his mother's recipe.

03:08.255 --> 03:11.490
He mixes the ingredients
then kneads the dough,

03:11.592 --> 03:15.360
folds in the nuts,
separates the dough

03:15.495 --> 03:18.896
into small, round pieces,
and drops them into

03:18.933 --> 03:21.700
a pot of piping-hot oil
and waits for them

03:21.769 --> 03:23.835
to turn golden brown.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.908
PORGES:
Gregory followed his mother's
instructions to make

03:30.945 --> 03:33.244
these fried dough cakes
and passed them around

03:33.280 --> 03:36.181
to the rest of the crew --
everybody was happy

03:36.183 --> 03:39.851
to have this fresh treat
in the middle of the ocean.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.857
WILDMAN: But the scrumptious
confections have

03:45.960 --> 03:48.193
an unsavory side effect.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.999
PORGES: His crewmates
started getting sick.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.801
People who would eat
Gregory's treats

03:56.837 --> 03:59.705
were bending over,
holding their stomachs.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.674
WILDMAN: Horrified, Gregory
cuts open the cakes

04:02.710 --> 04:06.478
to find out what's causing
the sailors' stomach woes,

04:06.547 --> 04:08.880
and he quickly discovers
the problem.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.083
They aren't cooked through.

04:11.218 --> 04:14.152
PORGES: This was clearly the
cause of the sailors' sickness.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.555
Eating raw dough is
not a good idea.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.458
WILDMAN: Gregory is mortified.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.428
But what he does next
will catapult him

04:23.497 --> 04:26.631
into culinary stardom
and put his name

04:26.700 --> 04:28.700
in the history books forever.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.305
To solve the problem
of the undercooked cakes,

04:33.440 --> 04:36.574
Gregory comes up with a simple
and effective fix.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.011
He'll cut out the middle.

04:39.113 --> 04:42.113
After preparing the dough

04:42.182 --> 04:44.916
and folding in the nuts,
he punches a hole

04:44.985 --> 04:47.786
into each piece --
this time,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.888
they cook all the way through.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.726
And when Gregory serves them
to the crew,

04:54.762 --> 04:56.994
no one gets sick.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.264
PORGES: Gregory was thrilled.
He had stumbled onto

04:59.333 --> 05:01.332
the perfect solution
that allowed him

05:01.368 --> 05:03.334
and his fellow sailors
to have their cake,

05:03.470 --> 05:05.570
to eat it, too,
and not get sick.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.909
WILDMAN: Gregory returns home
and tells his mother

05:10.978 --> 05:13.211
about how he tweaked her recipe.

05:13.347 --> 05:16.248
She makes more of
these newly-shaped sweets

05:16.350 --> 05:18.750
and shares them
with friends and family.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.088
The nut-filled creations
are an instant hit,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.490
and they're given
a fitting nickname...

05:25.559 --> 05:27.959
"Doughnuts."

05:28.095 --> 05:30.629
These doughnuts went viral --
think about how perfect

05:30.764 --> 05:33.031
a snack it is --
it's portable,

05:33.133 --> 05:36.435
it can fit in your hand,
and it is delicious.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.506
WILDMAN:
Over the next several decades,

05:41.575 --> 05:44.876
the delectable doughnut tickles
taste buds across America.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.781
By the 1900s,
industrious inventors

05:49.783 --> 05:52.350
create machines to serve them
up for the masses.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.786
PORGES: They became one of
the world's most popular

05:54.888 --> 05:57.956
snacks, desserts,
even breakfast.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.459
Just about every type of store,
from a supermarket

06:01.528 --> 06:04.095
to a gas station,
began selling doughnuts,

06:04.164 --> 06:06.998
including stores that sold
nothing but doughnuts.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.805
WILDMAN: Today, this 1920s
electric doughnut maker

06:13.874 --> 06:16.407
is on display at
the MonDak Heritage Center

06:16.477 --> 06:18.676
in Sidney, Montana.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.346
It recalls the whole story
behind the origin

06:21.481 --> 06:23.915
of a beloved American treat.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.823
WILDMAN: Barcelona, Spain,
is home to the majestic

06:31.859 --> 06:34.826
basilica, the Sagrada Familia.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.963
Designed by architect
Antoni Gaudi,

06:38.098 --> 06:41.700
construction on this famed
building began in 1882

06:41.702 --> 06:45.236
and still remains unfinished
to this day.

06:45.305 --> 06:49.107
But the city is also home
to a lesser known institution,

06:49.209 --> 06:51.743
one that charts the history
of a very different country

06:51.878 --> 06:54.646
and a long-lost era.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.948
This is the Egyptian Museum.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.320
The collection includes

07:02.389 --> 07:04.889
fragments from an ancient
limestone temple

07:04.925 --> 07:07.659
known as the Cult Chapel of Iny,

07:07.728 --> 07:09.861
a gilded mummy case

07:09.996 --> 07:12.130
dating back to
the first century A.D.,

07:12.265 --> 07:16.101
and the head from a statue
of a long-dead pharaoh

07:16.236 --> 07:19.403
named Nectanebo<i> </i> I.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.941
But among
these extraordinary artifacts

07:22.943 --> 07:25.409
is a singular item
that portrays

07:25.446 --> 07:28.346
one of the most famous figures
of the ancient world.

07:28.382 --> 07:31.750
The item is two feet wide
and two-and-a-half feet long.

07:31.852 --> 07:35.220
It is made of limestone,
and it's engraved

07:35.222 --> 07:37.722
with pictures of people.

07:37.724 --> 07:41.660
It is extremely heavy,
and it's around 2,000 years old.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.364
WILDMAN: The carving recalls
a legendary queen

07:46.433 --> 07:48.967
whose rise to power was fueled
by greed,

07:49.069 --> 07:52.337
deception, and revenge.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.906
This is the origin story
of the most well known

07:55.041 --> 07:57.075
Egyptian ever.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.517
WILDMAN: It's the year
49 B.C.E. in Egypt.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.718
Upon the throne

08:07.754 --> 08:10.054
in the glittering capital
of Alexandria

08:10.123 --> 08:13.824
is the charismatic queen,
Cleopatra.

08:13.861 --> 08:17.729
Cleopatra was intelligent,
and she had a very high

08:17.731 --> 08:20.365
level of popularity
among her followers.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.405
WILDMAN: But her reign is
about to be cut short.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.741
Cleopatra's envious
younger brother,

08:29.876 --> 08:32.610
Ptolemy, covets the throne.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.146
Backed by the kingdom's
powerful generals,

08:35.249 --> 08:37.982
Ptolemy banishes Cleopatra
from the royal palace

08:38.051 --> 08:41.086
and claims the throne
for himself.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.588
Everything Cleopatra had
been working for was

08:43.657 --> 08:45.757
literally wiped out overnight.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.162
WILDMAN:
And for the deposed monarch,

08:51.231 --> 08:53.498
things are about to get worse.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.533
The Roman general,
Julius Caesar,

08:55.535 --> 08:58.102
is in talks with Ptolemy
at the royal palace.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.972
ALCOCK: This could've been
very bad news for Cleopatra.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.574
She was worried that
Julius Caesar and Ptolemy

09:03.644 --> 09:06.778
would work together to help
Ptolemy secure

09:06.780 --> 09:08.847
his position in Egypt.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.017
WILDMAN: Cleopatra realizes
her only chance

09:13.086 --> 09:15.887
to regain her throne is
to form an alliance

09:15.889 --> 09:19.190
with Caesar before he seals
a deal with her brother.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.260
She was exiled,
but she was undeterred.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.463
Cleopatra really wanted
to take her kingdom back.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.732
WILDMAN: Having lost almost
everything to her brother,

09:27.768 --> 09:30.735
the outcast monarch is
in a tricky position.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.871
Cleopatra knew that
the only weapons she had

09:33.941 --> 09:36.674
at her disposal were her wit
and her charm,

09:36.809 --> 09:39.677
and she believed that they were
powerful enough to convince

09:39.713 --> 09:42.914
Caesar to take her side
in the conflict.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.553
WILDMAN: But securing
a face-to-face meeting

09:48.655 --> 09:51.622
with Julius Caesar is
a risky endeavor.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.959
ALCOCK: If Cleopatra was caught
meeting with Julius Caesar

09:55.028 --> 09:57.862
right under her brother's nose,
this would most likely lead

09:57.931 --> 09:59.998
to her execution.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.634
WILDMAN: So what cunning plan
is this crafty queen

10:02.636 --> 10:04.636
about to unroll?

10:10.027 --> 10:12.860
It's the year 48 B.C.
in Egypt.

10:12.929 --> 10:16.231
Legendary queen, Cleopatra,
has been deposed

10:16.233 --> 10:18.667
by her own brother, Ptolemy.

10:18.769 --> 10:21.902
To retake the throne,
she must forge an alliance

10:21.938 --> 10:24.939
with the powerful Roman general
Julius Caesar,

10:25.008 --> 10:26.808
but Caesar is staying
in Ptolemy's

10:26.910 --> 10:29.210
heavily guarded palace.

10:29.279 --> 10:32.614
So how will the wily Cleopatra
slip in unnoticed?

10:35.585 --> 10:39.354
As the story goes,
Cleopatra ponders the problem

10:39.423 --> 10:42.057
then comes up
with a cunning idea,

10:42.192 --> 10:45.093
a brilliant ruse that will
allow her to slip

10:45.162 --> 10:48.596
inside the royal palace
totally undetected.

10:48.665 --> 10:51.666
She had an audacious plan
to bypass all of

10:51.668 --> 10:55.103
Ptolemy's guards and meet
with the Roman general.

10:55.172 --> 10:58.105
WILDMAN: She instructs
her loyal attendants

10:58.141 --> 11:01.242
to roll her up inside
a large carpet

11:01.311 --> 11:04.646
and carry her
to the royal palace.

11:08.985 --> 11:11.152
At the gate,
her servants explain

11:11.254 --> 11:13.521
to Ptolemy's guards
that the rug is a gift

11:13.557 --> 11:15.990
for the visiting Roman.

11:16.059 --> 11:18.326
If the guards inspected
the carpet, if her servants

11:18.395 --> 11:20.928
were forced to unroll it,
she would be identified

11:20.964 --> 11:23.164
and killed immediately.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.533
WILDMAN: It's a brazen gambit...

11:25.602 --> 11:27.802
but it works.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.238
Inside the palace,
the servants lay the carpet

11:30.307 --> 11:33.708
before the Roman general,
and in one smooth motion,

11:33.810 --> 11:36.945
out rolls Cleopatra.

11:39.983 --> 11:42.383
Caesar was shocked,

11:42.419 --> 11:45.286
but he gave her permission
to speak.

11:45.288 --> 11:49.090
WILDMAN: Cleopatra boldly makes
her case to the Roman general.

11:49.192 --> 11:53.361
When she is finished,
Julius Caesar gathers
his thoughts.

11:53.430 --> 11:57.432
Impressed with the ingenuity
of the spurned queen,

11:57.534 --> 12:00.568
he agrees to take her side.

12:00.604 --> 12:03.871
ALCOCK: Cleopatra was
absolutely elated.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.708
She has succeeded in
her incredibly dangerous,

12:06.843 --> 12:09.778
risky plan, and she's secured
the support of one of

12:09.880 --> 12:11.780
the most powerful people
in the world.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.084
WILDMAN: Eventually,
Caesar's army defeats

12:17.086 --> 12:18.987
Ptolemy's forces in battle.

12:19.122 --> 12:21.890
The usurped king drowns
trying to escape.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.593
Cleopatra reclaims her throne
and goes on to rule

12:25.662 --> 12:28.596
over Egypt for the rest
of her life.

12:28.731 --> 12:32.267
ALCOCK: This was really
where Cleopatra became famous.

12:32.269 --> 12:34.802
She cemented her name
into the history books

12:34.805 --> 12:37.172
through her cunning
and daring plan.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.010
WILDMAN: Today, this carving
of Cleopatra is on display

12:43.046 --> 12:45.613
at the Egyptian Museum
in Barcelona.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.850
It recalls a fearless leader
who pulled the rug

12:48.919 --> 12:51.553
out from under her own brother.

12:54.558 --> 12:56.758
Albuquerque, New Mexico,
is home

12:56.893 --> 13:00.094
to the longest aerial tramway
in the United States.

13:00.130 --> 13:03.964
This engineering marvel
travels 2.7 miles

13:04.000 --> 13:06.100
to the top of Sandia Peak,

13:06.136 --> 13:09.570
offering passengers
breathtaking views

13:09.606 --> 13:12.173
of the rugged
Rio Grande Valley below.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.980
But in the heart of the city
is an institution

13:19.049 --> 13:21.683
that rises to
even greater heights --

13:21.785 --> 13:26.120
the Anderson Abruzzo Albuquerque
International Balloon Museum.

13:30.193 --> 13:33.728
The collection celebrates
more than 200 years

13:33.730 --> 13:36.464
of lighter-than-air flight
and includes

13:36.533 --> 13:40.335
an antique device for measuring
altitude in a balloon,

13:40.470 --> 13:44.672
one of the first aerial cameras
dating back to 1910,

13:44.674 --> 13:48.876
and a 1957 research gondola

13:48.912 --> 13:52.413
sent up into the stratosphere
to study cosmic rays.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.485
But one item in the collection
honors a more recent

13:58.522 --> 14:01.022
aeronautical feat.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.491
The artifact stands about
10 feet tall

14:03.626 --> 14:05.859
and nearly 18 feet long.

14:05.896 --> 14:09.497
It's red and has British
and Swiss flags painted on top,

14:09.632 --> 14:12.567
and there are small, round
windows to be found

14:12.702 --> 14:14.869
on the front and the back.

14:14.871 --> 14:19.173
WILDMAN: This gleaming object
recalls an ambitious aviator

14:19.175 --> 14:22.109
and a record-setting quest
for glory.

14:22.178 --> 14:25.046
The artifact is tied
to one man's pursuit

14:25.115 --> 14:26.881
of a seemingly impossible dream.

14:33.023 --> 14:35.123
WILDMAN: It's 1997.

14:35.258 --> 14:38.726
A new contest is taking
the ballooning world by storm.

14:38.828 --> 14:41.996
As a promotion,
a beer company is offering

14:42.131 --> 14:45.600
$1 million to the first pilot
who can complete

14:45.669 --> 14:48.336
an unprecedented
aeronautical stunt --

14:48.438 --> 14:52.140
fly a balloon
around the world nonstop.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.609
This would be one
for the record books,

14:54.744 --> 14:57.512
and it would be one
that would stand forever.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.452
WILDMAN: A host of
ambitious balloonists,

15:04.521 --> 15:07.287
from the renowned sportsman,
Steve Fossett,

15:07.324 --> 15:10.558
to the famous billionaire
Richard Branson,

15:10.560 --> 15:13.094
have already tried in vain
to complete the epic

15:13.196 --> 15:15.396
20,000-mile trip.

15:15.465 --> 15:18.333
Some are brought down
by fierce storms.

15:18.435 --> 15:21.903
Others are slowed
by fickle winds

15:22.005 --> 15:25.106
and run out of supplies
before they can finish
the journey.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.975
This was dangerous.

15:30.380 --> 15:33.514
WILDMAN: But one upstart aviator
thinks he can succeed

15:33.583 --> 15:37.151
where others have failed --
a 41-year-old

15:37.187 --> 15:40.621
Swiss psychiatrist named
Bertrand Piccard.

15:40.657 --> 15:43.391
GARVER: Piccard was from
a long line of explorers.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.993
His grandfather was
a celebrated balloonist.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.396
His father was
an undersea explorer.

15:52.035 --> 15:55.670
WILDMAN: Piccard is convinced
he knows how to win.

15:55.739 --> 15:59.206
Whereas most of his competitors
flew their balloons

15:59.275 --> 16:02.343
at around 30,000 feet,
he'll design one

16:02.412 --> 16:05.612
that can cruise at almost
40,000 feet.

16:05.649 --> 16:09.417
Not only will this allow him
to fly above storms,

16:09.486 --> 16:12.286
but he thinks it will take
advantage of a unique

16:12.422 --> 16:15.556
meteorological phenomenon --

16:15.625 --> 16:18.526
jet streams.

16:18.661 --> 16:20.895
Jet streams are fast-moving
rivers of air

16:21.030 --> 16:23.630
that circulate
around the globe.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.632
WILDMAN: Piccard believes
these jet streams

16:25.669 --> 16:28.369
will help him complete
the trip quickly.

16:28.438 --> 16:30.938
He hoped to accomplish this
in under three weeks.

16:33.643 --> 16:35.843
WILDMAN: The strong winds
will also mean that Piccard

16:35.845 --> 16:39.079
can reduce the amount of propane
required for the journey,

16:39.115 --> 16:41.515
but it's a fine balance.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.784
GARVER: Propane was
the supply of fuel

16:43.853 --> 16:46.187
that would keep
the hot air balloon afloat.

16:46.289 --> 16:48.255
There was only so much
they could bring.

16:48.324 --> 16:51.525
They would have
to use it sparingly,
because if they ran out,

16:51.561 --> 16:53.628
they were done for.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.801
WILDMAN: On March 1, 1999,

16:59.936 --> 17:02.870
Piccard and his copilot,
Brian Jones,

17:02.906 --> 17:06.473
lift off from the Swiss Alps
aboard the Orbiter 3,

17:06.509 --> 17:10.244
a replica of which is now
on display

17:10.280 --> 17:13.781
at the Anderson Abruzzo
Albuquerque International
Balloon Museum.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.820
The pilots ascend
into the jet stream,

17:19.856 --> 17:21.822
and they begin their journey
around the world

17:21.858 --> 17:24.325
in an easterly direction.

17:24.394 --> 17:27.762
Over the next nine days,
they soar over Europe,

17:27.764 --> 17:31.499
the Middle East, India,
and China.

17:31.568 --> 17:35.169
But then,
over the Pacific Ocean,

17:35.304 --> 17:37.905
the winds suddenly disappear,

17:37.974 --> 17:40.641
and the balloon stops moving.

17:40.677 --> 17:42.409
GARVER: This was
the worst-case scenario.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.912
Without this jet stream,
they were basically stranded.

17:45.047 --> 17:48.983
WILDMAN:
The longer they're stuck,

17:48.985 --> 17:51.852
the more likely it is
their propane will run out,

17:51.921 --> 17:54.322
and they'll have to land.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.824
GARVER:
If Piccard and Jones don't
come up with something fast,

17:56.959 --> 17:58.926
this trip was doomed.

17:58.995 --> 18:02.630
WILDMAN: So will this sky-high
quest come to a crashing halt?

18:07.654 --> 18:10.053
It's 1999.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.923
Pilots Bertrand Piccard
and Brian Jones are trying

18:12.992 --> 18:16.661
to become the first
to fly a balloon
around the world nonstop,

18:16.763 --> 18:19.263
and it looks like
they might do it.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.899
But then, just as victory
seems to be within reach,

18:21.935 --> 18:25.135
the powerful winds propelling
them suddenly die down,

18:25.205 --> 18:28.906
leaving them floating hopelessly
over the Pacific Ocean.

18:28.975 --> 18:32.009
So will they ever complete
their epic journey?

18:35.047 --> 18:37.214
Piccard and Jones search
for a new route

18:37.283 --> 18:40.051
across the Pacific --
then, their ground-based

18:40.053 --> 18:43.721
team of meteorologists
sends them a promising report.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.857
The scientists predict
that a completely new

18:46.926 --> 18:50.394
jet stream may be forming
1,800 miles to the south

18:50.463 --> 18:52.630
of the balloon's location.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.899
If they found this jet stream,
they would make up

18:55.034 --> 18:57.501
all the time that they lost
and still achieve their goal

18:57.570 --> 18:59.704
in the time planned.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.773
But if these winds
weren't there

19:02.909 --> 19:04.942
when they arrived
at this location,

19:05.077 --> 19:08.045
it meant that they were
out of fuel, out of chances,

19:08.047 --> 19:10.248
and their flight was over.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.050
WILDMAN: Piccard and Jones
decide to take the gamble

19:13.185 --> 19:15.186
and head south.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.925
Six days later,
they reach the spot

19:21.961 --> 19:24.795
where the model predicted
the jet stream would be.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.466
Sure enough, the air current
begins pushing them east

19:28.568 --> 19:32.069
at a whopping
155 miles per hour.

19:32.138 --> 19:35.973
GARVER: It must have been
thrilling for Piccard and Jones.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.877
They put it all on the line,
and the gamble paid off.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.280
They were moving in this jet
stream twice as fast

19:43.349 --> 19:45.683
as they had previously.

19:48.654 --> 19:51.255
WILDMAN:
The aeronauts speed over Mexico,

19:51.257 --> 19:54.458
the Atlantic Ocean,
and into North Africa.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.628
Finally, on March 21, 1999,

19:57.664 --> 20:01.165
after 20 days and almost
26,000 miles,

20:01.167 --> 20:05.169
they cross their starting
longitude and win the prize.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.239
The flight goes down
as one of the greatest

20:08.341 --> 20:10.508
achievements
in aviation history...

20:10.610 --> 20:13.711
in more ways than one.

20:13.813 --> 20:17.914
GARVER: Not only had they flown
around the world nonstop

20:17.951 --> 20:20.451
in a balloon,
but they also set a record

20:20.553 --> 20:23.588
for the longest flight of
any human-occupied,

20:23.690 --> 20:25.956
earthbound aircraft.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.726
WILDMAN: Bertrand Piccard
and Brian Jones are awarded

20:28.861 --> 20:32.196
the million-dollar prize,
and their daring achievement

20:32.265 --> 20:34.865
makes headlines
across the globe.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.039
Today, this replica
of the Orbiter 3

20:42.141 --> 20:46.677
is on display at the Anderson
Abruzzo Albuquerque

20:46.679 --> 20:49.647
International Balloon Museum.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.817
It's a testament
to one man's lofty ambition

20:52.952 --> 20:55.386
who soared
into the record books.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.826
The Washington Monument,

21:02.895 --> 21:05.629
the Lincoln Memorial,

21:05.698 --> 21:08.299
and the Capitol Building
are just a few

21:08.401 --> 21:12.036
of the awe-inspiring landmarks
in Washington, D.C.,

21:12.038 --> 21:15.439
but tucked among
these illustrious attractions

21:15.508 --> 21:17.775
is an institution
that focuses

21:17.910 --> 21:20.577
on the darker side
of government --

21:20.647 --> 21:22.980
the International Spy Museum.

21:22.982 --> 21:26.583
It houses

21:26.653 --> 21:29.720
the largest collection of
espionage-related artifacts

21:29.822 --> 21:33.190
in the world,
including a tube of lipstick

21:33.226 --> 21:35.192
that doubles as a gun,

21:35.327 --> 21:37.728
a World War II era bomb

21:37.764 --> 21:41.198
disguised as a water canteen,

21:41.267 --> 21:44.935
and an umbrella that fires
poison pellets.

21:45.004 --> 21:48.572
But one item here

21:48.707 --> 21:51.375
has the most extraordinary
story to tell.

21:51.377 --> 21:54.745
HOUGHTON:
It is made out of aluminum
and a hardened rubber shell.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.948
It has a combination lock
with three numbered

21:57.950 --> 22:01.351
rotary dials --
tucked inside the case

22:01.387 --> 22:04.155
are two electronics components
with wires

22:04.157 --> 22:06.691
nestled in a foam housing.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.627
It almost looks like a piece
of lab testing equipment.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.463
WILDMAN: This object recalls

22:12.565 --> 22:15.899
a sinister deception that seems
ripped from the pages

22:15.935 --> 22:18.435
of a Cold War thriller.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.771
This briefcase is connected
to one of the most notorious

22:20.773 --> 22:23.174
tales of espionage
in American history.

22:28.314 --> 22:30.715
WILDMAN: 1967, Virginia.

22:30.817 --> 22:34.384
Thirty-year-old John Walker
is an officer

22:34.454 --> 22:36.720
with the U.S. Navy.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.323
He's stationed at the Atlantic
Fleet Submarine Force

22:39.392 --> 22:41.658
headquarters in Norfolk.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.861
HOUGHTON:
John Walker was an exceptional
Navy warrant officer.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.198
He had some of the highest
possible clearance

22:47.200 --> 22:49.567
you could have within
the United States Navy.

22:53.272 --> 22:56.674
WILDMAN: But outside of work,
Walker's life is in shambles.

22:56.676 --> 23:01.011
After several bad investments,
he's on the brink of bankruptcy.

23:01.147 --> 23:05.082
His personal life was turning
into a disaster.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.618
He needed money
and needed money fast.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.087
His marriage is crumbling
around him,

23:10.089 --> 23:13.490
and he sees no out
for the personal problems

23:13.493 --> 23:15.693
he has found himself in.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.963
WILDMAN:
It's then that the officer
makes a fateful decision.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.303
Walker will sell
American military secrets

23:26.305 --> 23:29.039
to the Soviet Union.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.976
He had perfect access
to all the top-secret
information.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.381
WILDMAN: In October,

23:37.383 --> 23:40.584
Walker photocopies a slew
of classified documents

23:40.653 --> 23:44.387
detailing the capabilities
of the U.S. submarine fleet.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.359
Then, he brazenly

23:48.361 --> 23:51.061
walks into the Soviet embassy
in Washington

23:51.164 --> 23:54.131
and tells them he wants
to make a deal.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.201
The Soviets are dumbfounded

23:57.336 --> 23:59.937
but delighted.

23:59.939 --> 24:03.073
Together, they set up
a clever arrangement,

24:03.109 --> 24:06.210
whereby Walker can hand over
information in exchange

24:06.279 --> 24:09.546
for money without ever having
to come into contact

24:09.549 --> 24:12.015
with a Soviet agent.

24:12.150 --> 24:15.152
So Walker and the Soviets
establish a series of locations

24:15.154 --> 24:17.687
where Walker can leave
the information,

24:17.723 --> 24:19.857
and then the Soviets can
go back and pick it up.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.897
WILDMAN: In the months
that follow, Walker leaks

24:26.966 --> 24:29.567
a host of vital documents
to the enemy,

24:29.669 --> 24:33.236
enabling the Russians
to eavesdrop on coded

24:33.272 --> 24:36.440
transmissions between
U.S. ships and their bases.

24:36.542 --> 24:39.109
And as promised,

24:39.111 --> 24:42.045
the Soviets pay Walker
handsomely.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.582
HOUGHTON: Walker's espionage is
incredibly successful.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.218
He's making more money
than he did before.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.520
This was gonna be
the opportunity for Walker

24:49.655 --> 24:52.489
to essentially have
a retirement plan in place.

24:52.558 --> 24:55.793
WILDMAN: The naval officer
continues to pass

24:55.895 --> 24:57.928
classified information
to the Soviets

24:57.997 --> 25:00.397
for another 18 years.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.933
HOUGHTON:
He provided information
at regular intervals,

25:02.935 --> 25:07.071
and each time he handed over
thousands of top-secret
documents to the Soviets.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.276
WILDMAN: To make sure
he isn't discovered,

25:13.312 --> 25:16.513
Walker routinely sweeps
his home and office

25:16.582 --> 25:19.416
for surveillance equipment
using a kit hidden

25:19.452 --> 25:22.686
inside a briefcase,
the same one now on display

25:22.788 --> 25:26.891
at the International Spy Museum,
but in 1984,

25:27.026 --> 25:30.895
something happens that changes
Walker's fortunes forever.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.231
HOUGHTON: After nearly two
decades of routine spying,

25:34.366 --> 25:37.968
John Walker was about to get
stung by someone close to him.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.859
It's 1984.

25:45.962 --> 25:48.962
A treasonous Navy officer
named John Walker

25:49.031 --> 25:51.565
has been selling military
secrets to the Russians

25:51.567 --> 25:54.068
for more than a decade.

25:54.070 --> 25:56.503
But now this traitor is
about to be betrayed

25:56.606 --> 25:58.472
by the unlikeliest foe.

26:01.710 --> 26:04.978
One day, Walker gets into
a huge fight

26:05.047 --> 26:07.982
with his now ex-wife,
Barbara Crowley,

26:08.117 --> 26:10.751
who has long known
of his treachery.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.053
Now in the midst
of a custody battle,

26:13.089 --> 26:15.389
she turns him into the FBI.

26:15.458 --> 26:18.859
Based on her tip,
federal agents launch

26:18.928 --> 26:21.061
a surveillance operation.

26:21.130 --> 26:22.863
HOUGHTON: They were able
to install a tap

26:22.932 --> 26:24.865
onto his phone lines
and actually put

26:24.934 --> 26:27.001
surveillance outside of
his house.

26:27.103 --> 26:30.004
WILDMAN: The FBI follows Walker

26:30.106 --> 26:33.273
and eventually spots him
leaving a mysterious package

26:33.342 --> 26:36.677
in a park outside of
Poolesville, Maryland.

26:36.746 --> 26:39.913
They swoop in and pick it up.

26:39.982 --> 26:43.751
It contains a host of
classified military documents.

26:43.853 --> 26:47.821
HOUGHTON:
They finally had Walker
right where they wanted him.

26:47.890 --> 26:50.223
Now, they had everything
they needed to make sure

26:50.292 --> 26:52.793
Walker never saw the light
of day again.

26:52.795 --> 26:56.530
WILDMAN: On May 20, 1985,

26:56.632 --> 27:00.600
the FBI arrests John Walker.

27:00.670 --> 27:03.537
He's charged with multiple
counts of espionage.

27:03.639 --> 27:06.306
Later that year,
he pleads guilty

27:06.375 --> 27:08.842
and is sentenced to life
in prison.

27:08.911 --> 27:11.712
John Walker's treachery goes
down as the biggest

27:11.814 --> 27:15.682
and most damaging betrayal
in the history of
the U.S. Navy.

27:15.751 --> 27:17.984
HOUGHTON:
The fact that Walker was able
to get away with this

27:18.054 --> 27:20.220
for almost two decades
was a shock

27:20.256 --> 27:22.656
to the American
counterintelligence system.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.992
If it weren't for a jilted
ex-wife...

27:25.127 --> 27:28.195
Walker may have never
been caught.

27:32.435 --> 27:35.335
WILDMAN: Today, the briefcase
used by John Walker

27:35.404 --> 27:37.404
to sweep for surveillance
equipment

27:37.539 --> 27:39.940
is in the collection
of the International Spy Museum

27:40.075 --> 27:42.276
in Washington, D.C.

27:42.278 --> 27:45.446
It recalls the treasonous
officer who conspired

27:45.448 --> 27:47.948
against his country for cash.

27:54.623 --> 27:56.456
Gold Hill, Oregon.

27:56.525 --> 27:58.625
In the 1850s,
a gold strike here

27:58.761 --> 28:01.094
lured hundreds of prospectors
to the area

28:01.163 --> 28:03.597
in hopes of striking it rich.

28:03.666 --> 28:06.533
Today, this small town boasts
one of the nation's

28:06.668 --> 28:10.237
most perplexing institutions --
the Oregon Vortex

28:10.306 --> 28:12.639
and House of Mystery.

28:15.978 --> 28:17.978
The building is filled
with relics from the region's

28:18.113 --> 28:20.981
mining past,
but the institution's

28:21.050 --> 28:24.518
most captivating quality is
also its most unnerving,

28:24.620 --> 28:29.122
and one item here speaks
to this curious phenomenon.

28:29.191 --> 28:32.693
CAIN BIANCO: The artifact is
about 12 inches in diameter

28:32.695 --> 28:35.195
and circular in shape.

28:35.197 --> 28:37.997
It's made of black vinyl
with an off yellow label

28:38.033 --> 28:39.800
in the center.

28:39.802 --> 28:43.203
The words "The House of Mystery"
are displayed.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.874
WILDMAN: This vinyl record
holds the secret

28:46.876 --> 28:49.610
to a mind-boggling experience.

28:49.712 --> 28:52.078
This is the story
of a scientist,

28:52.148 --> 28:54.514
a series of illnesses,

28:54.583 --> 28:57.184
and a sinister plot of land.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.759
WILDMAN: It's 1930
in Gold Hill, Oregon.

29:05.861 --> 29:09.429
A unique roadside attraction
has just opened.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.366
Its name?
The Fabulous Oregon Vortex,

29:12.501 --> 29:15.569
housed in a single-story
building that once served

29:15.571 --> 29:18.472
as a mining office --
its founder,

29:18.474 --> 29:22.042
a man named John Litster,
claims the site

29:22.177 --> 29:26.179
possesses an unusual power --
inside this simple shack,

29:26.248 --> 29:29.816
the laws of gravity
don't apply.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.718
People didn't believe that
there could be a spot

29:31.720 --> 29:33.887
where gravity itself
was different.

29:33.956 --> 29:38.057
WILDMAN: John Litster claims
that he discovered the building

29:38.093 --> 29:41.061
several years earlier
while visiting the area.

29:41.130 --> 29:44.264
Now, he is ready to share
the dwelling's gravity-bending

29:44.333 --> 29:46.834
properties with the public.

29:46.969 --> 29:49.603
As each curious sightseer
enters the space,

29:49.672 --> 29:53.607
they experience an unusual
and unsettling reaction.

29:53.609 --> 29:56.376
CAIN BIANCO: They felt symptoms
as they walked through.

29:56.479 --> 29:58.645
Dizziness, nausea,

29:58.780 --> 30:01.014
people would get headaches.

30:01.116 --> 30:03.650
It was odd.

30:03.652 --> 30:06.486
WILDMAN: Then Litster proceeds

30:06.522 --> 30:09.690
to demonstrate a series
of weird phenomena.

30:09.692 --> 30:12.125
First, he places a ball
on the floor.

30:12.194 --> 30:14.494
It appears to roll uphill.

30:14.530 --> 30:17.364
Then he balances a broom

30:17.366 --> 30:19.799
upright on its bristles.

30:19.835 --> 30:21.701
CAIN BIANCO:
They were amazed.

30:21.770 --> 30:24.538
A broom could be stood up,
and it wouldn't fall over.

30:24.607 --> 30:26.706
It would stay up for minutes.

30:26.775 --> 30:29.176
[ Clapping ]

30:29.311 --> 30:32.379
WILDMAN: Finally, he shows off
the most baffling thing of all.

30:32.448 --> 30:35.248
He has two people stand
and face each other

30:35.251 --> 30:38.518
in a specified spot
outside the house.

30:38.587 --> 30:42.756
When he has them switch places,
their heights appear to change.

30:42.825 --> 30:45.192
CAIN BIANCO:
Tall people would look smaller,

30:45.327 --> 30:47.394
and smaller people
would look taller.

30:47.396 --> 30:50.264
You could actually bring
two people into that spot,

30:50.399 --> 30:53.333
and their heights would appear
to change as they walk
through the area.

30:56.906 --> 30:59.206
WILDMAN: Visitors are blown away
by the spectacle.

30:59.308 --> 31:01.308
No one had seen this before.

31:04.146 --> 31:07.480
WILDMAN: Litster says the house
is located in what he calls

31:07.516 --> 31:10.350
a unique bubble in the Earth's
magnetic field

31:10.352 --> 31:13.553
in which the laws of gravity
are distorted.

31:13.556 --> 31:16.423
CAIN BIANCO: Litster believed
that the magnetic fields

31:16.558 --> 31:19.893
that governed the area could
actually affect gravity.

31:20.028 --> 31:22.495
WILDMAN: Litster makes
an audio recording

31:22.565 --> 31:25.031
of his explanation,
which is then pressed

31:25.100 --> 31:27.634
onto vinyl records,
one of which is still

31:27.670 --> 31:30.970
on display at the Oregon Vortex
and House of Mystery,

31:30.972 --> 31:33.740
and distributes them
to patrons.

31:33.809 --> 31:36.577
But not everyone is convinced.

31:36.712 --> 31:39.046
CAIN BIANCO: This spot was
literally defying gravity.

31:39.048 --> 31:41.581
A lot of people said there was
absolutely no way

31:41.584 --> 31:43.917
his findings could possibly
be true.

31:44.052 --> 31:45.986
WILDMAN: So what's the truth
behind the so-called

31:46.055 --> 31:48.188
Oregon Vortex?

31:53.779 --> 31:56.012
It's 1930.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.882
In the tiny Oregon town
of Gold Hill,

31:58.951 --> 32:02.485
residents are flocking
to a very strange structure.

32:02.554 --> 32:05.488
It's called the Fabulous
Oregon Vortex.

32:05.557 --> 32:08.158
On the outside,
it appears to be nothing more

32:08.160 --> 32:11.328
than a decrepit wooden cabin,

32:11.330 --> 32:15.131
but inside, objects appear
to defy the laws of gravity.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.735
So what's the secret behind
this creepy cottage?

32:23.575 --> 32:26.843
In 1959, the attraction's
founder, John Litster,

32:26.845 --> 32:30.913
passes away, apparently taking
the secret of the Oregon Vortex

32:30.949 --> 32:33.050
with him to the grave.

32:35.821 --> 32:39.789
Then, in 2003, a professional
investigator named James Randi

32:39.825 --> 32:43.793
decides to figure out the truth
behind this strange house
once and for all.

32:43.862 --> 32:47.931
Randi suspects the answer lies
in a down-to-earth explanation.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.734
He thought the entire mystery
was much simpler

32:50.803 --> 32:53.035
than Litster was making it
out to be.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.672
WILDMAN: Randi researches

32:55.774 --> 32:58.008
the region's history,
and it turns out

32:58.110 --> 33:01.144
that in 1910, a mudslide
had pushed the abandoned

33:01.246 --> 33:03.747
mining office down a hill.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.416
When it stopped,
the structure came to rest

33:06.452 --> 33:08.551
on a slope.

33:08.587 --> 33:12.155
Randi argues that because
the floor of the house

33:12.224 --> 33:15.025
wasn't completely level,
it could easily warp

33:15.027 --> 33:18.428
a visitor's depth perception
and cause headaches

33:18.464 --> 33:20.563
as well as nausea.

33:20.565 --> 33:22.699
CAIN BIANCO: The difference
between what people were seeing

33:22.834 --> 33:24.834
and what their bodies
were experiencing

33:24.836 --> 33:26.903
could actually make people
feel sick.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.972
WILDMAN: Such an explanation
would also account

33:29.107 --> 33:30.974
for objects appear
to roll uphill

33:31.109 --> 33:34.043
or otherwise defying
the laws of gravity.

33:34.079 --> 33:37.380
It could even account

33:37.416 --> 33:40.250
for the house's most famous
purported quality --

33:40.252 --> 33:43.720
the ability to distort
people's heights.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.856
CAIN BIANCO: The odd angles
could actually make it appear

33:46.892 --> 33:49.993
that people's heights were
changing or that people

33:49.995 --> 33:52.262
were leaning over
without falling.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.031
It was only
an optical illusion.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.537
WILDMAN: Randi's theory is
accepted as a likely

34:00.606 --> 34:03.340
explanation for the house's
unusual powers,

34:03.342 --> 34:06.409
but even with this scientific
knowledge, tourists

34:06.411 --> 34:08.812
continue to flock to
the Oregon Vortex

34:08.914 --> 34:11.814
to explore this phenomenon
for themselves.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.818
CAIN BIANCO:
Visitors to the area today
are still warned

34:14.887 --> 34:16.920
that they may start to feel
a little bit ill

34:16.922 --> 34:18.922
when they enter the area.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.559
WILDMAN: And this vinyl
recording made

34:22.561 --> 34:24.828
by the attraction's founder,
John Litster,

34:24.963 --> 34:27.697
is on display at what is
now known as the Oregon Vortex

34:27.733 --> 34:30.834
and House of Mystery
in Gold Hill, Oregon.

34:30.903 --> 34:34.237
It recalls an eccentric
geologist and a building

34:34.339 --> 34:37.307
that seemed to rewrite
the laws of gravity.

34:43.048 --> 34:45.515
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
is home to historic

34:45.517 --> 34:47.951
landmarks that date back
to the nation's founding,

34:48.020 --> 34:50.587
such as Independence Hall,

34:50.656 --> 34:53.055
the Betsy Ross House,

34:53.091 --> 34:55.258
and the Declaration House,

34:55.360 --> 34:57.326
where Thomas Jefferson penned

34:57.362 --> 34:59.962
the Declaration of Independence.

34:59.998 --> 35:02.098
So it's only fitting

35:02.201 --> 35:04.100
that it's also home
to an institution

35:04.203 --> 35:06.369
that charts
this patriotic legacy --

35:06.405 --> 35:09.105
the Museum of
the American Revolution.

35:12.845 --> 35:15.579
The collection includes
muskets wielded

35:15.714 --> 35:18.748
by Continental Army soldiers
in 1775,

35:18.750 --> 35:21.618
a gunpowder horn once owned

35:21.620 --> 35:24.587
by an American rifleman
who fought in the revolution,

35:24.656 --> 35:26.756
and engraved silver cups

35:26.825 --> 35:28.992
used by
General George Washington.

35:32.798 --> 35:36.332
But amid
these pristine artifacts
is one very battered relic.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.835
QUINONES: The entire item
is made of silk.

35:38.937 --> 35:43.173
It's a very faded tan color
with some flecks of gold,

35:43.175 --> 35:46.109
and you can see part of
what looks like a cross.

35:49.381 --> 35:52.048
WILDMAN: This tattered object
recalls a high-stakes

35:52.117 --> 35:55.318
military mix-up that saved
the fight for freedom.

35:55.387 --> 35:59.556
This artifact is connected
to a crucial mistake

35:59.625 --> 36:03.293
that turned the tide of
the American Revolution.

36:06.732 --> 36:10.033
WILDMAN: December 1776,
Pennsylvania.

36:10.102 --> 36:13.469
Five months after declaring
independence,

36:13.539 --> 36:16.472
the rebellious Americans are
struggling in their battle

36:16.508 --> 36:18.341
against the British.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.343
Under the command of
General George Washington,

36:20.445 --> 36:23.146
the Continental Army has
suffered a string

36:23.281 --> 36:25.448
of devastating defeats.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.551
The outcome of the revolution
hangs by a thread.

36:28.620 --> 36:32.088
QUINONES: The Continental Army
was in shambles.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.091
They'd lost virtually
every battle they'd fought in

36:35.226 --> 36:37.093
at that point,
and it just seemed like

36:37.228 --> 36:39.396
victory was at hand
for the British.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.968
WILDMAN: Washington faces
an enemy that has

36:45.070 --> 36:47.036
superior training,
better equipment,

36:47.105 --> 36:49.772
and overwhelming numbers.

36:49.841 --> 36:53.042
But the general's most
alarming problem

36:53.111 --> 36:55.712
is his troops' dwindling morale.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.781
QUINONES: His men are tired,
they're starving,

36:57.883 --> 36:59.449
they're depressed.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.985
Washington knew he needed
something to help make them

37:02.054 --> 37:04.588
believe they could win this war.

37:08.526 --> 37:11.094
WILDMAN:
To raise his men's spirits,

37:11.163 --> 37:13.329
Washington sets his sights
on what he thinks

37:13.398 --> 37:16.932
is an opportune target --
a lightly defended outpost

37:16.969 --> 37:19.636
that is held by a garrison
of German mercenaries

37:19.738 --> 37:22.072
known as the Hessians.

37:22.207 --> 37:24.941
QUINONES:
The Hessians were fighting
on behalf of King George III.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.744
They were paid soldiers
and supplemented

37:27.813 --> 37:30.146
British forces in America.

37:30.182 --> 37:31.748
WILDMAN:
The Hessian camp is located

37:31.883 --> 37:34.985
across the Delaware River
in Trenton, New Jersey.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.556
Washington believes he can
catch the enemy by surprise

37:39.691 --> 37:42.826
with an attack on the day
after Christmas.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.828
QUINONES: He knew from
the culture of the Hessians

37:44.963 --> 37:47.363
that they would be heavily
celebrating the holiday,

37:47.432 --> 37:50.734
and Washington figures,
"They'll never expect that."

37:54.206 --> 37:56.506
WILDMAN: On the evening
of December 25th,

37:56.508 --> 37:59.109
Washington and his troops
load into boats

37:59.211 --> 38:01.645
and set off under the cover
of darkness,

38:01.780 --> 38:04.114
but as they row across
the Delaware,

38:04.216 --> 38:06.850
they face a seemingly
impenetrable obstacle --

38:06.952 --> 38:10.186
the waterway is choked
with ice.

38:10.222 --> 38:13.923
QUINONES:
1776 was a very cold winter.

38:13.992 --> 38:17.694
The Delaware River was so icy
that some of the regiments

38:17.763 --> 38:20.196
were completely unable
to cross.

38:20.331 --> 38:23.466
WILDMAN: After four long hours,

38:23.535 --> 38:25.468
Washington makes it
to the other side

38:25.537 --> 38:28.104
with a mere fraction
of his troops,

38:28.173 --> 38:30.540
but it's too late
to turn back now.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.411
Any chance of victory hinges
on the element of surprise.

38:34.513 --> 38:37.213
If the Hessians had
advanced warning

38:37.215 --> 38:39.882
of Washington's approach,
this might have been

38:39.951 --> 38:43.219
devastating for Continental
forces, as the Hessians were

38:43.321 --> 38:46.056
some of the finest fighters
from Europe.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.360
WILDMAN: But what Washington
doesn't realize

38:51.430 --> 38:55.231
is that he may have already lost
his most strategic advantage.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.635
Several hours earlier,
a lookout for the British

38:58.770 --> 39:00.970
on the New Jersey side
of the river

39:01.039 --> 39:03.773
had spotted Washington's troops
crossing the Delaware.

39:03.908 --> 39:06.509
The spy had sent a message
to the Hessians

39:06.578 --> 39:09.279
warning of the impending attack.

39:09.381 --> 39:12.381
QUINONES: It looked like
Washington's big bet

39:12.451 --> 39:16.452
was a historic mistake.

39:16.488 --> 39:20.657
WILDMAN: So are the Americans
heading into a death trap?

39:24.479 --> 39:27.814
It's December 25, 1776.

39:27.916 --> 39:30.917
George Washington is about
to launch a surprise attack

39:31.019 --> 39:33.753
on an enemy outpost
in Trenton, New Jersey.

39:33.888 --> 39:36.989
The operation hinges
on complete secrecy,

39:37.058 --> 39:39.993
but what Washington
doesn't realize

39:39.995 --> 39:42.495
is his troops have already
been spotted.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.267
The lookout arrives
at the Hessian camp

39:47.402 --> 39:50.470
in Trenton to warn them
of Washington's approach.

39:50.605 --> 39:54.607
There he finds the soldiers
enjoying their Christmas
celebrations,

39:54.643 --> 39:58.311
so he pens an urgent note
to the Hessian commander,

39:58.446 --> 40:01.080
a man named
Colonel Johann Rall,

40:01.216 --> 40:04.150
but when it's delivered,
the officer is having

40:04.252 --> 40:06.318
too much fun to read it.

40:06.354 --> 40:08.955
QUINONES: He was playing cards,
having a great time,

40:09.024 --> 40:11.925
so he didn't care about it--
he just put it in his pocket.

40:11.927 --> 40:14.127
He'll look at it tomorrow.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.399
WILDMAN: On December 26th
at 8 o'clock in the morning,

40:20.469 --> 40:23.102
Washington's forces attack.

40:23.138 --> 40:26.239
The Hessians are taken
completely by surprise.

40:26.374 --> 40:29.208
The Hessians had to have been
stunned that Washington

40:29.244 --> 40:32.512
was attacking them that day--
no one expected it.

40:32.614 --> 40:35.247
WILDMAN: Colonel Rall is
killed in the battle,

40:35.283 --> 40:39.719
and less than an hour later,
the German troops surrender.

40:44.192 --> 40:47.894
Afterward, American soldiers
discover the unread note

40:48.029 --> 40:50.429
in Rall's pocket.

40:50.465 --> 40:52.431
QUINONES: Washington must not
have only felt lucky

40:52.467 --> 40:56.636
but total relief when
he realized just how close

40:56.705 --> 40:59.905
to being killed or captured
he was.

40:59.941 --> 41:03.576
WILDMAN: The victory
at the Battle of Trenton

41:03.645 --> 41:07.513
boosts the Americans' morale,
and the Continental Army

41:07.549 --> 41:10.116
goes on to win a series
of decisive victories

41:10.185 --> 41:12.251
over the Redcoats.

41:12.254 --> 41:14.921
QUINONES: The victory at Trenton
rallied the soldiers,

41:14.923 --> 41:17.524
and they went into 1777

41:17.659 --> 41:19.592
newly energized

41:19.661 --> 41:21.961
and ready to fight the British.

41:21.963 --> 41:25.064
In the end,
Washington played his cards

41:25.066 --> 41:27.300
a bit better than the enemy.

41:30.872 --> 41:32.805
WILDMAN: Today,
this Hessian flag

41:32.874 --> 41:35.007
from that fateful battle
is on display

41:35.043 --> 41:37.744
at the Museum of the American
Revolution in Philadelphia.

41:37.746 --> 41:41.614
It recalls the surprise attack
that was almost undone

41:41.683 --> 41:44.017
by a simple note of warning.

41:46.488 --> 41:48.487
From a house of mystery

41:48.557 --> 41:50.690
to a rogue spy.

41:50.792 --> 41:53.359
A culinary creation

41:53.461 --> 41:55.561
to a cunning queen.

41:55.630 --> 41:57.563
I'm Don Wildman, and these

41:57.632 --> 41:59.632
are the Mysteries at the Museum.
