WEBVTT

00:20.621 --> 00:23.222
We'll fight this to the end.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.324
For you, sam.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.909
I don't have time to
draw you today lucky.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.078
Although you are
by far the best

00:46.180 --> 00:47.679
and most
prestigious model.

00:47.782 --> 00:48.847
You are going
to have to save

00:48.949 --> 00:50.883
your cute poses
for another day.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.059
New town.
New day.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.894
New walls
to conquer.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.307
Hey wallace!

01:15.409 --> 01:16.475
Hey!

01:19.847 --> 01:23.115
That is beautiful.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.351
And moving.
I mean...

01:26.454 --> 01:28.654
There's so much
life to it.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.557
This is a perfect welcome
to the new pediatric ward.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.925
Hmm.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.593
Well you know my
office is near to here

01:34.695 --> 01:35.594
so if you ever
need anything.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.895
I forgot the pink.
I'll be right back.

01:36.997 --> 01:37.996
Okay.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.500
Do you need a hand
with anything?

01:43.938 --> 01:45.204
Vanessa!

01:50.010 --> 01:51.276
Nate!

01:51.378 --> 01:53.011
You're back in town!

01:53.447 --> 01:54.480
Sorry I'm late.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.682
The plane from boston
was delayed. As usual.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.117
You're here now, right.
That's what matters.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.318
-Right.
-Cool.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.186
So, I made some
changes on the plane.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.354
Okay.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.223
I contacted the city for
the final code inspections.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.757
There should be
no further delays.

02:05.860 --> 02:06.792
Awesome.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.427
Is that the art
for the lobby?

02:08.529 --> 02:09.795
For the whole wall
to the entrance

02:09.897 --> 02:11.263
to the new pediatric
waiting area.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.798
What do you think?

02:12.900 --> 02:15.267
I thought we were going for
art that would compliment

02:15.369 --> 02:17.102
the modern lines
of the building.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.471
No. The board thought she
captures a light of innocence

02:19.573 --> 02:21.807
that would connect
with younger patients.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.742
Besides she has a
lot of experience.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.911
It's a little juvenile,
don't you think?

02:26.013 --> 02:28.914
I mean, I didn't spend all
this money on industrial

02:29.016 --> 02:31.450
materials to have it covered
with clouds and butterflies.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.018
Well I like to think I've
captured the essence

02:33.120 --> 02:35.220
of the community in my sketch.

02:35.489 --> 02:39.558
Either way, the murals are
for the patients, not you.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.593
Vanessa brent.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.362
Juvenile artist.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.267
Uh...
Pleased to meet you.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.302
I'm sorry if I offended you.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.803
I should get started
on the mural.

02:51.906 --> 02:53.939
I have a tango lesson
to get to later.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.908
And carlos cannot
be kept waiting.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.981
Oh. Let's take a look
at those revisions.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.483
I'm really curious to see
what you've come up with.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.151
All right.
Sounds good.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.655
(wallace)
ah, nate?<i> (snaps fingers)</i>

03:09.757 --> 03:11.557
ah yeah. Yeah.
Of course.

03:21.135 --> 03:22.968
All right, samantha.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.636
Let's do this.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.348
But the guest house is mine.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.184
I, I built it, mom.
I kind of own it.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.820
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but you know I have to

03:41.922 --> 03:43.655
make hay while
the sun shines.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.692
It's high season.
I needed the spill over.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.027
Well, glad that my hard
work and expensive degree

03:49.129 --> 03:50.696
are paying off for you.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.332
That's not the only
bonus of your degree.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.168
Bragging rights about your
big building projects

03:56.270 --> 03:58.937
at town socials
is a huge plus.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.174
It's so easy to wind joyce
up when she starts in

04:02.276 --> 04:04.243
with her 'my son this
and my son that'

04:04.345 --> 04:06.745
and I just mention the
new haven theatre opening

04:06.847 --> 04:08.747
and the kind words
the mayor said.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.949
Then she really
has to eat her pie.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.251
(nate laughs)

04:12.353 --> 04:16.121
so why don't you get settled in
that lovely room upstairs?

04:16.223 --> 04:18.423
I have slept in that room.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.325
'lovely' isn't the word
that comes to mind

04:20.427 --> 04:21.860
when the pipes
start knocking.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.263
That's all part of
the charm of the inn.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.898
And maybe it will inspire
you to get your tools out

04:27.001 --> 04:28.667
and help fix the banging.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.204
Yeah. It's probably
been challenging

04:32.306 --> 04:34.873
without dad's magical
handyman touch.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.110
It's not the only
thing I miss.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.545
But I'm so lucky I get
to see a piece of him

04:40.648 --> 04:42.714
every time I look
into your eyes.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.850
All right.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.719
I'll come back down
in a few minutes

04:47.821 --> 04:50.455
and hear a few more stories
about you terrorizing joyce.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.890
And you get started
on a list of things

04:51.992 --> 04:53.392
I can fix
while I'm home.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.061

after a big class.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.352
Not much to tell.

09:14.454 --> 09:17.355
I'm out on the road
a lot on commissions

09:17.457 --> 09:19.457
so I don't really
have a home base.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.260
Although my rabbit
keeps me grounded.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.796
Wherever he is,
that's home.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.032

09:27.134 --> 09:29.367
Yeah. He started
out as lark

a real support.

Who knew?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.711
I never know where
we're going to end up

09:39.813 --> 09:44.349
but wherever we land tends to
be exactly the right spot.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.185
Why about a home base?

09:47.287 --> 09:49.754
Everybody needs a home.

own the inn too.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.759
I want you to

14:21.862 --> 14:24.362
My parents do too.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.733
We want to give
you my trust fund.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.537
So you can really live.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.343
You can pay it forward.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.279
I can try.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.614
But I don't know

14:42.716 --> 14:44.649
these last two

14:44.751 --> 14:46.050
No!

14:46.152 --> 14:48.253
Don't you dare
say no to love

14:48.355 --> 14:50.755
when it comes
looking for you.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.524
Because it will.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.930

15:15.782 --> 15:17.782

15:19.019 --> 15:21.252

16:28.655 --> 16:31.155
Whoa! Very nice.
Is that me?

16:31.624 --> 16:34.559
Beautiful. Very nice.
Oh!

16:34.661 --> 16:37.895
Excellent job, sofia.
I love the colors you used.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.831
Thanks, vanessa.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.368
Wow! Would you look at that!

16:44.804 --> 16:46.971
Oh, thank you!

16:47.073 --> 16:48.606
When are you coming back?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.375
The day after tomorrow.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.776
And we're going
to do ceramics.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.648
Thank you so much for
taking the time to do this.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.784
When I heard you were in
town, I had to see if

16:59.886 --> 17:01.519
you were available to
do a class or two.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.087
It's my pleasure.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.156
You know, I follow
your work online.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.157
Oh.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.658
Big fan.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.927
And you have a great
way with the kids too.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.764
This was the highlight
of their week.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.165
Well, they have a
great way of making

17:14.267 --> 17:16.367
all our problems
seem a lot smaller.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.802
Yeah, it's true.

17:17.904 --> 17:18.970
You'd never know
how sick they are

17:19.072 --> 17:20.905
by their cheery
dispositions.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.176
Hey, I don't mean to
change the topic,

17:25.278 --> 17:29.614
but do you know a guy
named nate dalton?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.816
He's the architectural
engineer who designed

17:31.918 --> 17:34.118
the new build for the
pediatric ward.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.486
Of course I know nate.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.954
We went all through
school together.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.291
He said he was going
through a life disruption.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.859
I don't mean to pry,
I was just wondering...

17:41.961 --> 17:44.262
It's actually
the other d word.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.630
The what?

17:45.732 --> 17:46.664
Divorce.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.167
Oh.
That's always awful.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.869
Well, all I'll say is

17:51.971 --> 17:53.738
she might have grown
towards another man.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.906
Oh.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.209
Oops, I guess that
wasn't very subtle.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.977
That was right on the nose.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.379
(they both laugh)

18:03.550 --> 18:06.517
<i> (motorcycle engine roaring)</i>

18:08.922 --> 18:10.555
<i> (knock at door)</i>

18:11.825 --> 18:14.659
nate!
Long time no see.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.796
Okay weird, I was just
talking about you.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.665
It's been a while.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.300
I've sort of
been laying low.

18:22.402 --> 18:26.838
So, I know have art
classes around the city.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.539
I'm assuming that
you're plugged into

18:28.641 --> 18:29.907
the arts
community?

18:30.009 --> 18:31.509
Yeah.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.879
Well, I'm wondering if
you know anything about

18:34.981 --> 18:37.215
vanessa brent who's
doing the mural?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.383
Okay, weird. Again.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.653
Yes I do. She's a very
accomplished artist.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.589
Do you know where I could
see any of her old work.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.390
I couldn't find
anything online.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.893
Probably because you search
under vanessa brent.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.696
All that I can tell you is
that her murals are amazing.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.266
All painted in hospitals,
hospices and community spaces.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.401
She has a following of
people who believe that

18:57.504 --> 18:59.504
her art has
healing quality.

18:59.606 --> 19:03.841
She's famous and always
paints an angel in her murals.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.043
It's her signature.

19:06.146 --> 19:09.714
She's not very open about her
inspirations, though, but...

19:11.317 --> 19:14.452
But the gala for the
opening of the new wing

19:14.554 --> 19:16.354
sounds like it will
be a great party.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.622
Yeah, yeah yeah.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.956
You have your
tickets all lined up?

19:19.058 --> 19:20.358
(vanessa)
are you following me?

19:20.460 --> 19:23.895
First the bar and now you
just happen to walk in here.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.998
We went to school together.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.933
Were you asking
caroline about me?

19:29.035 --> 19:31.068
Now to be fair, vanessa,
you were asking...

19:31.171 --> 19:32.904
I was looking for a
professional reference

19:33.006 --> 19:33.938
since we're working together.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.474
I mean, in the
same building.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.042
I was just trying to...

19:38.144 --> 19:39.544
Trying to get more
information than you did

19:39.646 --> 19:41.712
last night on your little
fishing expedition? Huh?

19:43.983 --> 19:46.450
Okay.
Bye, caroline.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.152
I have an appointment.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.122
I didn't mean to
upset you, vanessa.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.123
I, ah...

19:52.225 --> 19:53.224
<i> (door closes)</i>

19:54.093 --> 19:55.893
nice work, nate.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.896
I hope you didn't offend her
so much that she's not going

19:58.998 --> 20:01.599
to teach my art
classes anymore.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.634
I got to get better
at this stuff.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.503
Yeah, you do.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.772
Because she's amazing.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.141
She's been such an
inspiration to the kids here.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.076
And she's teaching
these classes for free.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.412
Just like she's doing
the mural for free.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.914
I've never met
anyone more generous.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.950
I feel like I'm back
in eighth grade.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.851
I can confirm that
you were actually

20:20.954 --> 20:23.254
more smooth in eighth grade.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.759
<i> (knocking at door)</i>

20:32.198 --> 20:34.265
I hope I'm not
bothering you.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.834
I brought a peace offering.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.036
It's barbecue from
my favorite place.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.306
Can I bring it in?

20:43.243 --> 20:44.308
(sniffs)

20:44.410 --> 20:47.678
fortunately, your favorite
place's barbecue smells

20:47.780 --> 20:51.399
delicious, so I won't send
you and your food home.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.518
I can stay?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.721
As long as it takes
to eat dinner.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.191
I am tired but
I'm also starving.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.193
I guess I'm lucky I
caught you hungry.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.729
Lucky is as lucky does.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.931
Nate, meet lucky.

21:07.433 --> 21:11.402
Does my mom know you have
vermin running loose

21:11.504 --> 21:13.137
in the guest house.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.905
He's not vermin.
He's a rabbit.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.707
And he's house trained.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.676
What kind of a heathen
bunny do you think he is?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.045
One with nasty sharp teeth?

21:21.147 --> 21:24.181
He doesn't bite.
He's vegetarian.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.250
Vegan actually.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.986
Oh.
That's modern.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.355
This is so good.

21:31.858 --> 21:35.293
Thank you. I pride myself
on being good a orderer.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.827
Although I do like
cooking as well.

21:36.929 --> 21:37.828
-Really?
-Uh huh.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.797
I took some lessons
not too long ago.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.565
But you have to
have time to actually

21:41.668 --> 21:43.467
buy ingredients to cook.
Who knew?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.871
You certainly seem to
keep yourself busy.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.073
You're always taking
lessons, giving lessons.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.042
Do you ever just
stand still?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.343
I do.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.746
I meditate and I say prayers
for half an hour in the morning.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.282
But that's it.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.819
Life's too short to waste
even a minute of it.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.523
I've put about 90 thousand
miles on that old van out there

22:05.625 --> 22:08.626
and I am not ready to
slow down anytime soon.

22:09.595 --> 22:13.331
What about settling down?
Ever?

22:13.866 --> 22:16.033
I'm here to make my
mark on the world.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.269
That's why I love painting.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.706
The art I create
will live on.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.641
It'll out live
the both of us.

22:24.510 --> 22:28.412
I can capture a moment in time
and someone 20 years from now

22:28.514 --> 22:31.449
will get joy from seeing
it for the first time.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.652
That's exactly how I
feel about my builds.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.355
You know, it's like
I'm a part of them.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.925
Do you have pictures of
any of your buildings?

22:41.027 --> 22:43.260
Ah, yeah, yeah.
A few.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.801
This is from a
few months ago.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.503
It's an apartment complex.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.138
(vanessa) I love the lines!

22:54.240 --> 22:55.740
Very mature.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.442
I like the
materials you used.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.144
It's very modern.

23:00.246 --> 23:03.180
And, ah, this is
from a few years ago.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.582
It's a commercial building.

23:04.684 --> 23:05.916
It looks like the
front of the hospital.

23:06.018 --> 23:06.917
Uh huh.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.754
Well you definitely
have your own style.

23:16.162 --> 23:20.030
Yeah, ah, you definitely
have your own style, too.

23:20.133 --> 23:22.800
After my little
digging expedition,

23:22.902 --> 23:25.703
I found a few of your
paintings online.

23:25.805 --> 23:29.573
They are so evocative
and refreshing.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.709
And I love the palette.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.178
Thank you.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.148
I take great care picking
the shades I use.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.986
How did you move from
canvases to murals?

23:42.088 --> 23:43.521
I mean, have you done many?

23:43.623 --> 23:46.390
That's a long story.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.894
I needed to get on the
road and clear my head.

23:49.996 --> 23:53.497
And the more of the world I saw
and the towns I passed through

23:53.599 --> 23:55.666
the bigger
the works got.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.735
Eventually, there wasn't
a canvas big enough

23:57.837 --> 24:00.971
so I switched to the
sides of buildings.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.507
Oh. I hope you asked
permission first.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.748
<i> (vanessa and nate laughing)</i>

24:11.250 --> 24:12.850
(vanessa)
thank you.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.219
Those were the best
ribs I've ever had.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.854
Oh, I'm glad you liked them.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.558
It's okay. I'll grab,
I'll take care of those.

24:20.660 --> 24:25.796
Sorry. I have some... Uhm...
Some, umm, health issues.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.598
Nothing serious, I hope.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.366
No. Not really.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.406
It's cold in here. Do you
want me to light a fire?

24:36.108 --> 24:38.676
I mean, I built one, but I
can't get the damper to work.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.511
Oh, yeah. It's sticky.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.112
Here, I'll take care of it.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.297
(nate)
there we go.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.700
When did you get this place?

25:02.802 --> 25:04.268
It's actually one of
the first structures

25:04.370 --> 25:06.070
I ever designed
and built.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.938
You built this yourself?

25:08.040 --> 25:10.474
Well, actually, I
built it with my dad.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.611
We had dreams of growing
the business together.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.547
He would be the retired
words of wisdom

25:16.649 --> 25:20.417
and I'd be the young
grasshopper and chief designer.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.919
And then we'd
both help my mom

25:22.021 --> 25:24.421
with her dream of
running the inn.

25:25.558 --> 25:30.261
Sadly he passed away shortly
after we completed it.

25:31.898 --> 25:34.231
I'm sorry.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.904
That's exactly why I don't
put my dreams on hold.

25:42.441 --> 25:45.042
I actually have
a list of dreams

25:45.144 --> 25:47.111
that I want to
accomplish.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.112
Oh.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.380
Uh huh.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.287
Okay, let's see.

25:56.622 --> 25:59.223
Skydive in hawaii - check.

25:59.692 --> 26:00.691
Wow!

26:01.460 --> 26:04.995
Watch the sunset in a field
of sunflowers - check.

26:05.097 --> 26:09.066
Learn to tango
- in progress.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.570
It's like a bucket list.

26:13.639 --> 26:18.075
I've had amazing experiences
because of this list.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.780
You should go.
I'm kind of tired.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.182
Ah, sure.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.719
If you ever need any help
checking things off the list,

26:28.821 --> 26:30.921
I'm pretty good
at logistics.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.190
Thanks for dinner, nate.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.225
I'll see you tomorrow
at the hospital.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.428
I'll be the one up
on the scaffold.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.967
I meant I could teach you
how to ride my motorcycle.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.704
I guess you have the first
requirement of a bike.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.772
I do indeed.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.209
Let me sleep on it.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.778
Okay.
Good night.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.156
What would sam think of him?

27:06.258 --> 27:08.025
List worthy?

27:15.735 --> 27:17.034
I like to start at the top

27:17.136 --> 27:19.203
and then work my way
across and down.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.804
I've had the most
success this way.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.706
Your mural is going to
perfectly complement

27:22.808 --> 27:24.341
nate's architecture.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.410
It's like the two were
made for each other.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.012
Nice try, wallace.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.146
(wallace laughs)

27:31.017 --> 27:33.083
ah, there you are.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.551
We were just talking
about you, nate.

27:34.654 --> 27:35.819
Oh really?

27:36.489 --> 27:38.322
So, ah, have you given
it any more thought

27:38.424 --> 27:40.858
to my teaching
you to ride?

27:42.294 --> 27:43.927
Pick me up at six.

27:45.598 --> 27:48.599
Yeah, sure. I'll, I'll
bring you a helmet.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.409
(knocks on door)

28:04.617 --> 28:06.083
okay!

28:11.190 --> 28:12.990
All right.
You good?

28:13.092 --> 28:14.358
Do you have your
motorcycle permit?

28:14.460 --> 28:15.759
Yes, I have it.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.361
All right.
Any other questions?

28:17.463 --> 28:18.495
Nope.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.464
I think I'm ready
to give it a go.

28:20.566 --> 28:23.400
All right.
Time for your first ride.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.937
Take it easy the first
time out. Nice and slow.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.274
Take a big wide turn
at the dead end.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.409
And don't take your eyes
off the road. Ever.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.977
Roger that!

28:34.447 --> 28:35.946
Wish me luck!

28:36.382 --> 28:38.449
(nate) good luck!
Go get 'em!

28:40.853 --> 28:42.119
(vanessa)
whoa!

28:42.722 --> 28:43.854
(vanessa)
I'm doing it!

28:48.794 --> 28:50.327
You're doing great!

28:53.733 --> 28:55.566
(nate) looks great!
Take it around again.

29:14.353 --> 29:17.187
(vanessa breathing heavily)
I don't feel well.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.956
Help me.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.125
Sure. I'm right here.
I'm right here.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.726
Are you okay?

29:22.828 --> 29:24.795
I'll be fine.
I need to go home.

29:24.897 --> 29:25.996
You don't seem fine.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.232
No! I just need to go home.
My meds are there.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.767
Okay. All right.
I'll get you home.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.568
I got you.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.842
There must be
something else I can...

29:38.944 --> 29:40.744
Hey, how many more lessons
do you think I need

29:40.846 --> 29:43.514
before I've mastered
the motorcycle?

29:43.616 --> 29:45.482
Well, one, maybe.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.151
You're a pretty
fast learner.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.086
Maybe you're a good teacher.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.188
I'd like to think so.

29:53.526 --> 29:58.262
So, do you want to tell
me what's happening?

29:59.598 --> 30:02.199
There's nothing to share.

30:04.236 --> 30:07.738
Maybe it would
help if I go first.

30:09.642 --> 30:16.446
Umm, I am newly divorced.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.852
Taylor was cheating.

30:21.954 --> 30:25.956
With one of my best clients.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.861
Ouch.
That's no good.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.096
That's no wife.

30:33.799 --> 30:37.935
We'd been together
since we were eighteen.

30:39.905 --> 30:43.340
I'm sorry.
That's really awful.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.243
Maybe.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.147
I don't know.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.817
Maybe it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.220
Maybe your way of looking
at the big picture

30:56.322 --> 30:57.554
is rubbing off on me.

30:57.656 --> 31:00.123
Oh, that's my spiritual
side shining through.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.998
How do you adjust
to being alone?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.600
Well first you
need a rabbit.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.834
Oh, okay.

31:10.936 --> 31:13.003
<i> (they both laugh)</i>

31:14.640 --> 31:20.244
no but, seriously.
It just takes time.

31:20.346 --> 31:25.282
For me, the more
murals I did,

31:25.384 --> 31:28.218
the more I felt like
I wasn't so alone.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.255
I had a purpose.
I found my voice.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.791
And, I wanted to
share my voice

31:34.894 --> 31:38.462
to ease the
suffering of others.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.969
You have a pretty
deep soul, vanessa.

31:46.739 --> 31:50.040
I wish I could
forgive and move on.

31:50.142 --> 31:55.479
They say time heals but
the rumor mill just seems

31:55.581 --> 31:58.282
to make the wound
deeper for me.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.883
Healing is not a science.

31:59.985 --> 32:03.620
It's not something you
construct or measure.

32:03.722 --> 32:08.292
You just got to believe it's
going to get better, you know.

32:09.161 --> 32:13.397
Wake up every morning
and live life.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.833
Maybe I need a list.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.635
Maybe you do.

32:18.737 --> 32:19.736
(they both chuckle)

32:24.743 --> 32:27.611
it's getting late. I should
probably get to sleep.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.448
I have an early
morning appointment

32:31.550 --> 32:33.016
before I get
back to the mural.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.718
Yeah.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.457
Thanks for the lesson, nate.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.492
No problem.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.465
Good night!

32:48.567 --> 32:49.499
(nate)
<i> good night.</i>

32:49.601 --> 32:53.203
<i> (door opens and closes)</i>

33:09.021 --> 33:10.721
dr. Vogel. Hi.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.589
Thanks for seeing
me so early.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.257
Of course.
How're we feeling?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.726
Pretty good, generally.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.160
That's what I like to hear.

33:17.262 --> 33:19.663
Any troubles with the new
medication or supplements?

33:19.765 --> 33:21.298
A few dizzy spells.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.632
But a bit better
than the last round.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.368
Okay.
Dizzy.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.970
Well, your blood work should
be back in time for our next

33:27.072 --> 33:28.839
appointment so we can make
any changes we need to

33:28.941 --> 33:29.840
based on that.
Okay?

33:29.942 --> 33:30.974
Sounds good.

33:31.076 --> 33:33.443
All right. And I am going
to order you another mri.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.013
So you can book that with
reception on the way out.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.447
Got it.

33:37.549 --> 33:38.682
And remember vanessa.

33:38.784 --> 33:41.184
Rest is not going to
make a huge difference

33:41.286 --> 33:43.153
but it's good to give
your body a break.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.421
Duly noted.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.556
Okay.
We'll see you next time.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.363
Thank you.

34:02.408 --> 34:03.640
Hey!

34:03.742 --> 34:05.042
What are you doing here?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.510
Just getting an early start.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.145
What are you doing here?

34:08.247 --> 34:10.614
You know why I'm here.
I told you.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.816
Right.
The appointment...

34:12.918 --> 34:14.651
Are you checking
up on me?

34:18.957 --> 34:21.992
I really don't appreciate
you invading my privacy.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.326
At all.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.695
I was just concerned.

34:25.798 --> 34:27.297
The pills and the list...

34:27.399 --> 34:30.567
Again, everything to
do with me, not you.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.403
If you'll excuse me I'm
going to go on with my day.

34:47.019 --> 34:48.485
(knocking)

34:48.587 --> 34:51.054
hey! Need any help?

34:51.156 --> 34:53.957
Hey you!
This isn't Wednesday.

34:54.059 --> 34:55.358
Am I having one
of those moments?

34:55.461 --> 34:58.728
No, I just was in the area,
so I thought I'd stop by.

34:58.831 --> 35:00.430
Check in to see
if I could help.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.798
Sure can.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.702
So?

35:05.804 --> 35:08.438
Did anything come
of those questions

35:08.540 --> 35:10.540
nate was asking
me about you?

35:10.642 --> 35:12.375
There's nothing
to tell, caroline.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.010
Are you sure?

35:14.113 --> 35:16.246
Nothing to tell at all?

35:16.348 --> 35:21.351
I'm not interested in him
as more than just a friend.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.620
If that's what
you're implying.

35:23.722 --> 35:30.026
Nate is a person with a lot
of baggage, as you well know.

35:30.129 --> 35:33.497
Yes, nate has baggage,
but don't we all?

35:34.066 --> 35:36.099
Besides, I'm sure it's
nothing he couldn't

35:36.201 --> 35:38.535
work through for
the right person.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.905
Yeah. Possibly.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.876
You know, it's okay to
let your guard down

35:45.978 --> 35:47.577
and let someone in.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.747
I'm more of the 'moving on'
than the 'letting in' type.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.518
Running away isn't
the same as moving on.

35:58.423 --> 35:59.322
(kids laughing, talking)

35:59.424 --> 36:00.757
hey you guys!

36:01.193 --> 36:02.459
-Hi vanessa.
-Hi!

36:02.561 --> 36:03.660
This is my best friend lucy.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.128
Hello lucy.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.796
She's a little shy.

36:06.899 --> 36:09.633
Did you know that we both love
purple and mac and cheese.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.902
Purple mac and cheese!
Yuck!

36:12.004 --> 36:12.903
Yuck!

36:13.005 --> 36:13.970
Grab a seat you guys.

36:14.072 --> 36:15.872
Aprons first!

36:33.058 --> 36:34.858
Hey there. So.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.260
One of the things about not
being in a great marriage

36:37.362 --> 36:40.096
is you get really
good at apologizing.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.466
Give it your best shot.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.136
I'm sorry.

36:46.238 --> 36:47.671
No one has any
right to judge

36:47.773 --> 36:49.539
how someone else
lives their life.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.141
Least of all me.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.810
I am a grown man who
lives with his mom.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.715
Speaking of which she would
like to make us dinner.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.885
I don't suppose that mashed
potatoes and meatloaf

37:01.987 --> 37:03.987
are on your list?

37:07.426 --> 37:10.827
Thanks. I would love to
join iris for dinner.

37:10.929 --> 37:14.864
And if you happen to be
there, that would be okay too.

37:16.168 --> 37:17.234
Okay.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.070
But only if I can borrow
your bike so I can practice.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.339
Sure.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.842
Just take it easy. Okay?

37:25.944 --> 37:27.344
Can I bring anything?

37:27.446 --> 37:30.280
Just your appetite.
See you at seven.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.829
Thank you so much for
inviting me iris.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.097
Sure.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.632
Where's nate?

37:48.734 --> 37:49.933
He's been delayed
at the site.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.334
He should be here very soon.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.470
I'm glad that it's
just us girls, though.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.938
Me too.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.973
Is there anything I
can help you with?

37:57.075 --> 38:00.343
Ah. You can pull the ends
off those green beans.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.823
(iris) woah, I thought
you were a painter.

38:13.925 --> 38:17.193
Those are some pretty fancy
chef prep moves right there.

38:17.296 --> 38:20.497
I took some french
cooking lessons recently

38:20.599 --> 38:25.335
and I love garlic so I
put it in everything.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.371
Well, they will be
trés magnifique

38:28.473 --> 38:31.107
with my mash and
loaf a la iris.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.709
(they both laugh)

38:39.251 --> 38:41.818
nate told me about his dad.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.456
This place must have been
a big weight for you.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.725
Ever thought about
selling it and traveling?

38:50.162 --> 38:53.229
I feel closer to
john by staying here.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.665
I get to meet people from
every corner of the world.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.501
I am a part of some of the
biggest moments in their lives.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.037
We have weddings,
christenings

39:01.139 --> 39:03.039
and even wakes and
memorials. The gamut.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.542
I see more living pass
through these walls

39:05.644 --> 39:07.510
than I would ever
see on the road.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.347
Yeah.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.315
I guess you can have
a lot of connections

39:12.417 --> 39:14.150
when you stay
in one place.

39:14.252 --> 39:17.120
I never thought staying put
could bring so much joy.

39:17.222 --> 39:19.055
I don't have much
family of my own

39:19.157 --> 39:22.959
so I've never had
those big celebrations.

39:23.061 --> 39:26.029
You understand
what true loss is.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.465
Taylor never really knew
what nate went through

39:28.567 --> 39:30.066
when he lost his father.

39:30.168 --> 39:33.002
All she saw was him
moving away from her.

39:34.239 --> 39:37.140
There is so much we have to
go through on our own in life.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.776
But I have a lot of people
looking down on me.

39:39.878 --> 39:40.777
<i> (door opening)</i>

39:40.879 --> 39:42.412
so I'm never really alone.
<i> (door closes)</i>

39:43.415 --> 39:44.781
sorry I'm late.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.149
(iris)
no problem.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.618
You now have some
very fancy beans,

39:48.720 --> 39:50.053
thanks to your tardiness.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.255
Is that right?
Hmm.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.724
Well, go set the table.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.026
Yes mom.

39:57.129 --> 39:58.161
<i> (vanessa laughs)</i>

40:01.099 --> 40:02.866
(all laughing)

40:03.368 --> 40:06.002
you have a wise and
talented co-worker here.

40:06.104 --> 40:07.504
(nate)
oh! Co-worker.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.406
You really are on
your best behavior.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.640
I would have thought
you would have dropped

40:10.742 --> 40:13.743
all of your top matchmaking
hints by now.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.779
Well I have the
wishes of a mother

40:15.881 --> 40:18.448
don't always bend
the will of a son.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.251
Even if I can see what
both of you can't.

40:21.353 --> 40:24.120
And there it is!
(laughs)

40:25.223 --> 40:27.390
all right.
Since you insist, mother.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.960

<i> (monitor beeping)</i>

42:46.731 --> 42:48.665
hey you.

42:49.601 --> 42:50.767
Hey.

42:52.404 --> 42:54.504
I went out cold, right?

42:54.606 --> 42:56.773
Yeah.

42:57.943 --> 43:01.210
I hate that on a third date.
(laughs)

43:03.915 --> 43:05.949
no more jokes.

43:09.187 --> 43:11.588
It's time to
come clean then?

43:12.524 --> 43:14.390
It's time.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.527
What if I'm not ready?

43:21.466 --> 43:24.334
Then I don't know if
this can grow into

43:24.436 --> 43:26.636
anything more
than a friendship.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.372
Why not?

43:31.209 --> 43:33.109
Look.

43:33.211 --> 43:36.679
I've already had a woman in
my life who had secrets.

43:36.781 --> 43:40.183
And it wrecked me.

43:40.285 --> 43:43.786
You're mysterious
and it's intriguing,

43:43.888 --> 43:48.157
but you scared me.

43:49.427 --> 43:51.294
I need answers.

43:51.396 --> 43:54.197
I'm just living life
on my own terms.

43:54.299 --> 43:57.066
Not connecting or
sharing your life,

43:57.168 --> 43:58.635
it doesn't feel
like living.

43:58.737 --> 44:00.536
It feels like running away.

44:00.639 --> 44:03.072
Fair enough.
But it's my life.

44:14.252 --> 44:16.519
Then I'll leave you to it.

44:38.043 --> 44:39.742
Wow!

44:39.844 --> 44:40.977
I can't believe it.

44:41.079 --> 44:44.247
You've really captured the
spirit of creek falls.

44:44.349 --> 44:46.916
Peaceful, welcoming.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.451
And you're not
even finished.

44:48.553 --> 44:51.320
Thanks, caroline.
That mean a lot to me.

45:00.131 --> 45:01.264
Hey caroline.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.799
Nate.

45:02.901 --> 45:04.067
Hi vanessa.

45:04.469 --> 45:05.968
Hi.

45:06.071 --> 45:08.071
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

45:08.173 --> 45:09.739
Sure, if you like.

45:09.841 --> 45:10.940
Nice to see you, nate.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.041
You too.

45:16.614 --> 45:18.915
I'm glad to see
you back at work.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.719
You really scared me.

45:23.321 --> 45:25.221
I'm sorry.

45:25.323 --> 45:27.590
I wasn't up to
talking the other day.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.294
What you saw is a by-product
of the medication

45:31.396 --> 45:35.098
I have to take to make sure I
can keep working on my list.

45:35.734 --> 45:38.000
So you want me to stop
worrying about you?

45:38.103 --> 45:40.036
Yes.

45:40.839 --> 45:42.972
But what if I want to
spend more time with you?

45:43.074 --> 45:45.174
Well, we can keep
having fun together.

45:45.276 --> 45:47.343
And work on my list.

45:52.951 --> 45:55.451
Well, I did get a
peek at that list

45:55.553 --> 45:58.421
and there is something special
I think I can help with.

45:59.357 --> 46:01.958
Why don't I pick
you up after lunch

46:02.060 --> 46:03.960
and we take the
afternoon off?

46:04.062 --> 46:06.262
Sounds like a plan.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.698
All right.

46:19.844 --> 46:21.310
(vanessa)
right on time.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.479
Yes, being on time can
be a bit of a curse

46:23.581 --> 46:26.149
but today it's
working for me.

46:26.251 --> 46:27.450
So, are you ready to go?

46:27.552 --> 46:29.051
Pretty much.

46:32.257 --> 46:34.423
So, what's the surprise?

46:34.526 --> 46:37.193
Ah, today, I am the
one with the secrets.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.195
Now are you sure you don't
need a secret consultant?

46:39.297 --> 46:40.830
Because I have
years of experience.

46:40.932 --> 46:42.031
(they both laugh)

46:42.133 --> 46:44.400
yeah, I think I've picked up a
few pointers. (laughs)

46:45.537 --> 46:48.771
so I'm guessing there's
a car ride in my future?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.641
That is uncanny.
How did you do that?

46:51.743 --> 46:53.042
I'm psychic.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.610
(nate laughs)

46:55.380 --> 46:57.547
are we going hiking?
Because I've got sandals on.

46:57.649 --> 46:58.948
Nope. Not even close.

46:59.050 --> 47:00.216
(vanessa)<i> hot air ballooning?</i>
(nate)<i> no.</i>

47:00.318 --> 47:02.385
(vanessa)<i> paris? You're taking</i>
<i> me to paris? (laughs)</i>

47:03.955 --> 47:06.656
okay, now do I get
to see this surprise?

47:06.758 --> 47:08.524
Patience is a virtue.

47:08.626 --> 47:10.660
Sometimes it feels
like a luxury.

47:12.397 --> 47:13.830
Ta-da!

47:17.335 --> 47:19.869
(vanessa)
<i> ah! Butterflies!</i>

47:23.508 --> 47:24.941
Wow!

47:27.178 --> 47:28.244
Look!

47:29.414 --> 47:31.514
Oh wow!

47:31.983 --> 47:33.182
<i> (water gently running)</i>

47:37.322 --> 47:38.955
this is so beautiful.

47:46.998 --> 47:49.899
When I was a little girl,
my grandma told me that

47:50.001 --> 47:52.068
butterflies only
live for a day.

47:52.170 --> 47:56.339
You know, some butterflies
actually live for weeks,

47:56.441 --> 47:57.373
even months.

47:57.475 --> 47:58.674
-Really.
-Yes indeed.

47:58.776 --> 48:01.777
And monarch butterflies go
on these incredible journeys

48:01.880 --> 48:04.847
where they migrate for
thousands of miles.

48:04.949 --> 48:06.849
That kind of sounds
like my journey.

48:07.785 --> 48:11.020
Well, I'm just glad that your
journey brought you here.

48:31.075 --> 48:33.276
So, do you have anymore fun
facts about butterflies,

48:33.378 --> 48:35.077
mr. Science?

48:35.179 --> 48:36.879
I do, actually.

48:36.981 --> 48:41.751
Ah, did you know that
butterflies are cold-blooded?

48:41.853 --> 48:45.554
They need to bask in the sun
in order to be able to fly.

48:46.190 --> 48:47.990
How do you know all this?

48:48.092 --> 48:50.426
I worked here for
a few summers

48:50.528 --> 48:52.028
to help pay my way
through college.

48:52.130 --> 48:53.696
That's nice.

48:54.532 --> 48:57.133
Yeah. I felt like
I was on this path

48:57.235 --> 48:59.302
I thought everyone
had to be on.

48:59.404 --> 49:02.438
College, career,
get married,

49:02.540 --> 49:04.573
start a family
of my own.

49:04.676 --> 49:06.676
Oh, thank you.

49:07.345 --> 49:09.779
I did not see this
big break in the road.

49:09.881 --> 49:11.747
Sounds like you
were blind-sided.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.950
Maybe.

49:14.052 --> 49:16.619
Or maybe I was just
paying too much attention

49:16.721 --> 49:18.421
to the road ahead.

49:18.523 --> 49:20.690
I was so focused
on checking boxes

49:20.792 --> 49:24.493
I never engaged
with my life.

49:25.563 --> 49:29.265
The divorce has sort of
forced me to pay attention.

49:30.735 --> 49:33.269
And are you paying
attention now?

49:34.772 --> 49:36.639
I sure am.

49:44.382 --> 49:46.382
Now I would like
to share with you

49:46.484 --> 49:48.217
one of my very
favorite things.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.318
Oh?

49:50.655 --> 49:52.621
(laughs)
how did you...?

49:52.724 --> 49:54.390
What?

49:54.792 --> 49:58.561
This is a peanut butter
and mayo sandwich.

49:58.663 --> 49:59.562
Mayo?

49:59.664 --> 50:00.563
Uh huh. I know.

50:00.665 --> 50:02.365
You're a little
kooky, nate dalton.

50:02.467 --> 50:04.867
I prefer 'fun loving'.

50:04.969 --> 50:06.535
Hmm. Okay.

50:06.637 --> 50:07.636
(they both laugh)

50:10.108 --> 50:11.007
ready for a try?

50:11.109 --> 50:12.508
Here we go.

50:14.579 --> 50:15.678
That's really good.

50:15.780 --> 50:16.679
Yeah.

50:16.781 --> 50:17.680
(they both laugh)

50:17.782 --> 50:19.815
it's really satisfying.

50:20.318 --> 50:21.817
I invented this
when I was eight.

50:21.919 --> 50:22.918
No you did not!

50:23.021 --> 50:23.919
Uh huh.

50:24.022 --> 50:24.920
Really?

50:25.023 --> 50:26.889
It caused a stir
in my school.

50:26.991 --> 50:27.990
<i> (they both laugh)</i>

50:32.697 --> 50:35.064
oh! A shooting star!

50:35.166 --> 50:36.599
Make a wish.

50:36.801 --> 50:37.800
<i> (crickets chirping)</i>

50:43.708 --> 50:45.574
let me guess.

50:45.676 --> 50:48.010
You wished to
finish your list.

50:49.781 --> 50:52.014
What did you wish for?

50:52.950 --> 50:54.550
For you to be okay.

50:57.188 --> 50:59.722
I want you to be okay.
Are you okay?

50:59.824 --> 51:01.590
I'm okay.
I told you.

51:01.692 --> 51:03.826
I can take care of myself.

51:08.166 --> 51:12.201
I... I just don't
think it concerns you.

51:16.074 --> 51:18.340
But I want it to concern me.

51:21.479 --> 51:24.547
I'm just not ready, nate.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.252
(nate)<i> you shine brighter</i>
<i> than the stars.</i>

51:30.354 --> 51:31.353
(vanessa laughs)

51:31.722 --> 51:34.223
and you know your
butterflies.

51:36.260 --> 51:39.261
I love that those butterflies
made you so happy.

51:40.598 --> 51:42.798
Look at you.
You're freezing.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.233
Let's get you home.

51:44.335 --> 51:47.002
No, no.
I like it out here.

51:48.039 --> 51:50.039
(vanessa)
<i> and it's peaceful.</i>

51:51.042 --> 51:52.575

<i> five more minutes</i> .

51:53.411 --> 51:54.777
(vanessa)
five more minutes.

52:09.794 --> 52:12.328
So. What's next?

52:12.430 --> 52:14.964
Riding wild
stallions bareback?

52:15.066 --> 52:16.031
What else is on the list?

52:16.134 --> 52:19.301
Hmm...
There's rock climbing.

52:19.403 --> 52:21.137
I know a good
place for rocks.

52:21.239 --> 52:22.271
We could go tomorrow.

52:22.373 --> 52:23.472
It's Saturday,
I'm not working.

52:23.574 --> 52:25.641
I should probably keep
working on the mural.

52:25.743 --> 52:30.045
But, thank you for
a truly special day.

52:30.148 --> 52:32.848
I loved every minute of it.

52:32.950 --> 52:36.719
Well, I will see you for
breakfast in the dining room

52:36.821 --> 52:38.621
where I will do must best
to convince you to spend

52:38.723 --> 52:40.289
the whole day with me.

52:40.391 --> 52:41.524
Sounds good.
(giggles)

52:41.626 --> 52:43.058
whoa!

52:45.129 --> 52:46.395
Good night.

52:46.497 --> 52:47.496
Good night.

52:50.468 --> 52:53.602
<i> (door opens, closes)</i>

52:54.939 --> 52:56.906
what do you think?

52:57.008 --> 52:58.707
Can we trust him?

53:00.244 --> 53:02.478
I like him too.

53:03.114 --> 53:07.149
Maybe, just maybe, we can
cross the last two items

53:07.251 --> 53:09.919
off the list one day.

53:10.188 --> 53:12.621
Maybe.
(laughs)

53:32.076 --> 53:34.877
sam.

53:34.979 --> 53:37.613
If only you were here.

53:47.525 --> 53:50.025
Smells good.
No early risers?

53:50.127 --> 53:51.994
They'll be down
in a few minutes.

53:52.096 --> 53:53.862
How was the social?

53:53.965 --> 53:55.164
Any good gossip this week?

53:55.266 --> 53:57.166
Hey, is arthur goodman
still doing the thing

53:57.268 --> 53:58.934
with the suspenders
and the belt?

53:59.036 --> 54:01.503
Don't make fun of
arthur goodman.

54:01.606 --> 54:03.372
There's nothing wrong
with making sure

54:03.474 --> 54:05.007
your pants don't fall.

54:05.109 --> 54:06.141
Sit.

54:06.244 --> 54:07.243
(nate laughs)

54:07.845 --> 54:11.280
I had a nice
visit with joyce.

54:11.382 --> 54:13.682
Her nephew is coming
to visit next month.

54:13.784 --> 54:15.317
Of course he is.

54:15.419 --> 54:16.719
And all my friends
want to know

54:16.821 --> 54:19.188
how your children's
ward is coming along.

54:19.290 --> 54:21.190
Well, it isn't
exactly 'mine'.

54:21.292 --> 54:23.659
But you can tell them
that I'm drafting

54:23.761 --> 54:26.595
the last couple of changes.
They're going in for approvals.

54:26.697 --> 54:28.897
Yeah, we're nearly done.
It's all pretty positive.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.001
Great.
That's what I assumed.

54:32.436 --> 54:34.937
And how are you and vanessa?

54:37.441 --> 54:39.541
I'm your mother.

54:39.644 --> 54:41.644
I see the way you two
look at each other.

54:41.746 --> 54:44.780
She's a lovely person.
Share.

54:45.182 --> 54:49.818
Well, ah, the
mural is gorgeous.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.921
It's perfect for the kids.

54:53.024 --> 54:56.058
She really seems to care.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.861
You can tell it with
every brush stroke.

54:58.963 --> 55:01.330
And the way she
teaches the children.

55:03.601 --> 55:06.502
So this is a
relationship then?

55:06.604 --> 55:08.937
Ah, I don't know.

55:09.040 --> 55:11.440
She's very private.

55:11.542 --> 55:15.878
I saw her covering up some
bandages from some blood tests.

55:15.980 --> 55:18.714
I don't know what's
going on with her,

55:18.816 --> 55:20.916
but she doesn't
want to tell me.

55:21.018 --> 55:22.751
I can't have another
relationship

55:22.853 --> 55:25.254
filled with secrets.
Not after taylor.

55:25.356 --> 55:27.122
Vanessa isn't like that.

55:27.224 --> 55:28.357
You two are good
for each other.

55:28.459 --> 55:29.558
You lift each other up.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.027
Yeah. Maybe.
But what if...

55:32.129 --> 55:35.464
You need to let yourself
heal from taylor.

55:35.566 --> 55:37.132
And know that
you and vanessa

55:37.234 --> 55:39.768
are a completely
different kind of couple.

55:39.870 --> 55:42.504
I wish people would stop
bringing up taylor.

55:43.140 --> 55:44.973
Who's bringing up taylor?

55:46.077 --> 55:48.210
At the social?

55:48.312 --> 55:54.149
Sweetheart, I don't know how
to say this except to say it.

55:54.251 --> 55:57.720
Joyce heard that
taylor is pregnant.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.422
Taylor?

56:00.524 --> 56:04.593
My my taylor?
My my ex-taylor?

56:04.695 --> 56:07.363
That taylor, yes.

56:08.432 --> 56:09.998
Nate?

56:11.001 --> 56:12.000
Breathe, honey.

56:12.103 --> 56:14.236
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

56:14.939 --> 56:17.272
I know how much
you loved her.

56:17.375 --> 56:19.174
You stuck it out
for so many years.

56:19.276 --> 56:21.377
Yeah, I did.

56:21.846 --> 56:24.480
I thought we were
'til death do we part'.

56:24.582 --> 56:29.585
I thought we wanted to
have children together.

56:29.687 --> 56:34.390
I guess she just didn't want
to have children with me.

56:35.226 --> 56:38.127
You know, sometimes things
happen for a reason.

56:38.229 --> 56:39.962
It's only been a few months.

56:40.064 --> 56:42.531
She's already pregnant
with somebody's baby?

56:42.933 --> 56:44.800
I would have made
a great father.

56:44.902 --> 56:47.336
And you will be.
When the time is right.

56:47.438 --> 56:49.505
Exactly.
Never.

56:49.607 --> 56:51.707
Ready to convince me to
take the day off nate?

56:54.879 --> 56:56.612
I can't do this.

56:57.314 --> 57:00.315
What?
Nate! Nate!

57:03.087 --> 57:05.654
He's angry with someone
else, not with you.

57:05.756 --> 57:08.624
Not one day has gone by in
these last few weeks that

57:08.726 --> 57:10.559
nate hasn't smiled
from ear to ear.

57:10.661 --> 57:12.961
Because of you.
There is no way...

57:13.063 --> 57:16.231
No, there is every way
he wouldn't want this.

57:22.273 --> 57:24.173
I don't blame him.

57:37.121 --> 57:38.987
Sam.

57:43.794 --> 57:46.929
I have done it all.

57:47.031 --> 57:49.832
I have done the silly
things on your list.

57:49.934 --> 57:55.070
I have done the dangerous
things on the list.

57:55.172 --> 57:56.071
(breathing heavily)

57:56.173 --> 57:58.073
but the last two, sam,

57:58.175 --> 58:03.278
to love and be loved
and to get married.

58:03.380 --> 58:05.047
I don't know.

58:05.149 --> 58:08.584
(straining)
I have opened up my heart.

58:09.553 --> 58:12.521
You know how hard it
is for me to do that.

58:13.224 --> 58:15.090
But I really tried.

58:15.192 --> 58:16.892
(gasping for air)

58:16.994 --> 58:19.394
the last two
things on the list.

58:19.497 --> 58:21.363
I don't know if
I have it in me.

58:21.465 --> 58:22.898
It's just...
(sobbing)

58:24.468 --> 58:25.901
I don't know.

58:26.003 --> 58:29.171
(sobbing, gasping)

58:30.074 --> 58:32.341
(gasping)

58:33.310 --> 58:34.443
(breathing heavy)

58:34.545 --> 58:36.211
I am losing faith.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.113
(sobbing)

58:38.215 --> 58:41.250
I have fought so hard.

58:42.052 --> 58:44.386
And I've done all
the treatments.

58:44.488 --> 58:47.823
I have poured my heart out

58:47.925 --> 58:50.359
on countless murals
across the country.

58:51.529 --> 58:54.162
And I painted you
in them as an angel.

58:54.832 --> 58:57.533
Because I felt you with me.

58:58.235 --> 59:00.035
(struggling)

59:00.771 --> 59:01.970
(sobbing)

59:02.072 --> 59:03.972
I am tired.

59:04.074 --> 59:06.542
I am tired to the bone.

59:06.644 --> 59:10.245
I just...
I just need to rest.

59:10.347 --> 59:12.948
Please. I just,
I need to...

59:13.584 --> 59:15.083
I need to rest.

59:15.185 --> 59:16.151
(breathing heavily)

59:16.253 --> 59:17.252
ah...

59:36.407 --> 59:39.141
You have knocked it out
of the park, vanessa.

59:41.478 --> 59:42.945
(wallace)<i> this mural is ten</i>
<i> times more amazing</i>

59:43.047 --> 59:44.479
<i> than I thought</i>
<i> it would be.</i>

59:45.049 --> 59:47.783
I can't wait to share it with
everyone at the opening gala.

59:48.719 --> 59:50.953
Thanks, wallace.

59:52.122 --> 59:53.789
(wallace)
so.

59:54.425 --> 59:56.525
Do you think you'll
finish in time?

59:56.627 --> 59:57.926
I always do.

59:59.330 --> 1:00:01.229
Excellent.

1:00:01.999 --> 1:00:05.801
I just sealed a deal to
remodel a hospital in vermont.

1:00:05.903 --> 1:00:07.202
And they asked if
you'd be interested

1:00:07.304 --> 1:00:09.071
in painting a
mural for them.

1:00:10.307 --> 1:00:13.275
(quietly)
a sign. Thank you.

1:00:13.711 --> 1:00:15.143
Are you?

1:00:15.245 --> 1:00:16.645
You bet.

1:00:16.747 --> 1:00:18.213
I love the state of vermont.

1:00:18.315 --> 1:00:19.915
And I've always wanted to
work on a project there.

1:00:20.017 --> 1:00:21.383
And all that ice cream!

1:00:21.485 --> 1:00:22.718
(they both laugh)

1:00:24.021 --> 1:00:25.487
we'll find you
a place to live.

1:00:25.589 --> 1:00:26.488
They have a good budget.

1:00:26.590 --> 1:00:27.556
Great.

1:00:27.658 --> 1:00:29.958
The more I get, the
more I can give back.

1:00:33.030 --> 1:00:35.697
I understand supporting
a cause and everything,

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:38.500
but, can I ask?

1:00:38.602 --> 1:00:43.538
How are you living? You need
money to live too, right?

1:00:43.641 --> 1:00:46.041
I have my own means.

1:00:47.177 --> 1:00:49.544
And art raises the spirits.

1:00:49.647 --> 1:00:51.780
No matter how dire
your situation.

1:00:52.216 --> 1:00:55.951
I focus on serene colors so
that the kids that come in here

1:00:56.053 --> 1:00:59.438
can feel comfort
and light.

1:00:59.556 --> 1:01:01.757
They need to feel the
peace and the hope

1:01:01.859 --> 1:01:04.192
that art can inspire.

1:01:04.294 --> 1:01:06.728
I want my art to
make you feel better

1:01:06.830 --> 1:01:09.097
without you even
knowing why.

1:01:11.635 --> 1:01:14.102
I should stop chatting
and keep painting

1:01:14.204 --> 1:01:16.805
if I'm going to finish
this on time for the gala.

1:01:16.907 --> 1:01:17.973
I'll let the vermont
hospital know

1:01:18.075 --> 1:01:18.974
you've agreed
to do their mural.

1:01:19.076 --> 1:01:20.709
Thanks wallace.

1:01:24.415 --> 1:01:25.814
Climbing is such a workout.

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:29.084
I'm feeling muscles I never
even knew I had. (laughs)

1:01:29.186 --> 1:01:31.787
there is a real
color in your cheeks.

1:01:31.889 --> 1:01:35.157
I'm glad to see my son's
absence isn't a drain on you.

1:01:37.327 --> 1:01:40.128
It's hurting me more than
I want to admit, iris.

1:01:40.230 --> 1:01:42.130
I can't wallow in it.

1:01:42.232 --> 1:01:45.033
I have to finish the mural
in time for the gala.

1:01:45.135 --> 1:01:47.102
Will you stay
after the gala?

1:01:47.838 --> 1:01:51.239
I don't think so.
I got a job in vermont.

1:01:51.341 --> 1:01:53.775
I'll be painting the mural
at a hospital there.

1:01:53.877 --> 1:01:56.378
Wallace is project managing.

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:57.779
You're moving to vermont?

1:01:57.881 --> 1:01:59.581
Uh huh.

1:01:59.683 --> 1:02:02.818
All of the fresh air
and the fresh dairy.

1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:04.419
It'll be fun.

1:02:04.521 --> 1:02:08.490
All good points but,
will you tell nate?

1:02:08.592 --> 1:02:11.326
Well, he's not exactly
around to tell.

1:02:11.428 --> 1:02:13.962
I haven't seen him.
Have you?

1:02:14.064 --> 1:02:16.932
His boss called him back
on a project up in boston.

1:02:17.034 --> 1:02:19.501
It was 'erupting
like a volcano'.

1:02:19.603 --> 1:02:21.203
Apparently, he's been
spending too much time here

1:02:21.305 --> 1:02:23.238
and the other
project's suffered.

1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:25.340
Well that's that.

1:02:26.577 --> 1:02:29.911
I'm glad he's getting
his priorities in order.

1:02:30.013 --> 1:02:33.448
You are exactly what
he needs right now.

1:02:33.550 --> 1:02:37.085
If he had said that himself,
I'd be inclined to believe it.

1:02:37.187 --> 1:02:40.622
Please talk to him, vanessa.

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.761
I'm going to miss you, iris.

1:02:47.030 --> 1:02:48.363
I should go.

1:02:48.465 --> 1:02:50.365
I'll talk to you later.

1:02:58.242 --> 1:03:00.776
Yeah, so he just
left for boston.

1:03:00.878 --> 1:03:02.944
I still can't he
believe he just left.

1:03:03.046 --> 1:03:05.447
Well, his boss needed him back
on a project, apparently.

1:03:05.549 --> 1:03:07.482
Sure, his work.

1:03:08.152 --> 1:03:10.552
He came back for
the weekend, right?

1:03:10.654 --> 1:03:13.989
You didn't hear me.
Nate left. Period.

1:03:14.091 --> 1:03:15.090
<i> (a paintbrush drops</i>
<i> on the floor)</i>

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:18.493
here you go buddy.

1:03:18.595 --> 1:03:20.395
Sorry. I dropped it.

1:03:20.497 --> 1:03:22.063
That's okay.

1:03:22.166 --> 1:03:23.565
I noticed you're
putting a lot of work

1:03:23.667 --> 1:03:25.467
into your
painting today.

1:03:26.136 --> 1:03:28.370
I like seeing that
kind of effort.

1:03:28.472 --> 1:03:30.939
I hope to be as
good as you one day.

1:03:31.041 --> 1:03:34.042
Well, I think
that you can do

1:03:34.144 --> 1:03:36.778
whatever you set
your mind to, reese.

1:03:38.582 --> 1:03:40.348
I'm waiting.

1:03:40.684 --> 1:03:42.551
Waiting for what?

1:03:42.653 --> 1:03:44.186
For you to say that
you'll fight for him.

1:03:44.288 --> 1:03:46.288
I have done enough
fighting for my life.

1:03:46.390 --> 1:03:48.757
In my life.

1:03:48.859 --> 1:03:50.258
I'm kind of over it.

1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:51.760
I saw the way he
looked at you

1:03:51.862 --> 1:03:52.861
the other day when
he dropped by.

1:03:52.963 --> 1:03:54.896
And he barely knew you then.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:58.333
Will you at least just tell
him about your move to vermont?

1:03:58.435 --> 1:04:01.069
I don't want you
to leave, vanessa.

1:04:01.171 --> 1:04:05.006
Oh, sofia. You have so
many great friends here.

1:04:05.108 --> 1:04:06.608
Life long friends.

1:04:06.710 --> 1:04:08.810
They'll always
have your back.

1:04:09.279 --> 1:04:12.013
But who will have your back?

1:04:14.484 --> 1:04:16.585
Samantha.

1:04:16.687 --> 1:04:18.053
Always samantha.

1:04:18.155 --> 1:04:20.055
Who is samantha?

1:04:21.491 --> 1:04:26.127
She's someone who loved me
and was always there for me.

1:04:30.467 --> 1:04:31.833
Excuse me.

1:04:34.137 --> 1:04:35.437
Vanessa!

1:04:47.584 --> 1:04:49.551
<i> (curtains pulled back)</i>

1:04:50.854 --> 1:04:53.054
nothing came up on your mri.

1:04:53.156 --> 1:04:55.123
And your blood work
markers look really good.

1:04:55.225 --> 1:04:56.758
Phew.

1:04:57.861 --> 1:04:58.960
Looks like you're
just going to need

1:04:59.062 --> 1:05:00.629
routine blood
work once a year.

1:05:00.731 --> 1:05:02.163
Once a year?

1:05:02.266 --> 1:05:04.966
Oh, wow.

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:07.335
So does that mean I'm
officially in remission?

1:05:07.437 --> 1:05:08.670
It looks that way.

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:10.705
You're a very lucky girl.

1:05:11.108 --> 1:05:12.908
I know.

1:05:13.010 --> 1:05:16.177
Every morning I wake up
grateful I'm still here.

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:20.081
It's been a long journey
but you beat the odds.

1:05:20.183 --> 1:05:21.917
And your diligence
with the drug regime

1:05:22.019 --> 1:05:23.852
has really paid off.

1:05:23.954 --> 1:05:25.353
So no more pills?

1:05:25.455 --> 1:05:26.821
No more pills.

1:05:26.924 --> 1:05:28.490
Which means no
more side effects.

1:05:28.592 --> 1:05:30.825
Thank you.

1:05:30.928 --> 1:05:32.160
You're so welcome.

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:33.161
(vanessa)
thank you.

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:34.663
Good luck, vanessa.

1:05:34.765 --> 1:05:36.031
Go live your life
to the fullest.

1:05:36.133 --> 1:05:37.032
I will!

1:05:37.134 --> 1:05:38.133
Okay.

1:05:39.770 --> 1:05:41.469
Thank you.

1:05:47.711 --> 1:05:50.011
Mmm mmm!

1:05:50.113 --> 1:05:52.480
Lucky, you are looking
at a future top chef.

1:05:52.582 --> 1:05:55.517
Or maybe a future nobel
peace prize winner.

1:05:55.619 --> 1:05:56.785
(giggles)

1:05:58.488 --> 1:06:00.138
future.

1:06:02.759 --> 1:06:06.428
I haven't had an actual
future in years.

1:06:07.130 --> 1:06:10.198
Ah!

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:13.568
Think of all the
murals I can paint now.

1:06:13.670 --> 1:06:16.137
And think of all the new
adventures I can have.

1:06:16.239 --> 1:06:17.806
I can climb mountains.

1:06:17.908 --> 1:06:20.475
And I can, I can see all
the great art of the world.

1:06:20.577 --> 1:06:23.645
I can, I can sail
the seven seas.

1:06:23.747 --> 1:06:27.749
Although... I'm not
sure if I like sailing.

1:06:27.851 --> 1:06:29.784
Well, we'll see.

1:06:32.789 --> 1:06:35.490
Ready for the next
adventure, lucky? Huh?

1:06:36.660 --> 1:06:38.126
I'll take that as a yes.

1:06:49.039 --> 1:06:50.505
(dials phone)

1:06:53.627 --> 1:06:55.560
I was feeling a little at
loose ends with myself with

1:06:55.662 --> 1:06:56.995
nate being gone again.

1:06:57.097 --> 1:06:58.830
Yup.

1:06:58.932 --> 1:07:01.399
I'm glad we can go
to the gala together.

1:07:01.501 --> 1:07:03.034
Me too.

1:07:03.336 --> 1:07:06.071
Life's too short
to wait for anyone.

1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:08.039
(wallace)
you know it!

1:07:08.341 --> 1:07:09.674
You know what we should do?

1:07:09.776 --> 1:07:10.942
What?

1:07:11.044 --> 1:07:13.144
We should stay up all night
and watch the sun rise.

1:07:13.246 --> 1:07:15.847
Okay.
But I need a favor.

1:07:16.349 --> 1:07:17.482
Okay.

1:07:17.584 --> 1:07:19.117
Can you teach
me how to tango?

1:07:19.219 --> 1:07:20.318
I can teach you!

1:07:20.420 --> 1:07:21.319
-You can?
-I can.

1:07:21.421 --> 1:07:22.320
-You wouldn't mind?
-No.

1:07:22.422 --> 1:07:23.688
Okay. All right!
We're on.

1:07:23.790 --> 1:07:25.557
Oh. Here we are.

1:07:26.460 --> 1:07:27.959
All right.
You ready?

1:07:28.929 --> 1:07:30.628
Yeah. Yes.

1:07:30.731 --> 1:07:31.796
It's your night.

1:07:32.132 --> 1:07:35.834
<i> ♪ (jazzy music) ♪</i>

1:07:35.936 --> 1:07:39.304
I love love love
love love it.

1:07:39.406 --> 1:07:41.973
(caroline) the colors,
the style, the images.

1:07:42.075 --> 1:07:43.174
This is creek falls.

1:07:43.276 --> 1:07:45.443
And you are giving hope to
everyone who walks through

1:07:45.545 --> 1:07:47.612
these doors for care.

1:07:47.714 --> 1:07:49.013
It's extraordinary.

1:07:49.116 --> 1:07:50.715
Thanks, caroline.

1:07:50.817 --> 1:07:53.651
You are now appointed my
number one art reviewer.

1:07:53.754 --> 1:07:55.320
I'm not trying to
inflate your ego.

1:07:55.422 --> 1:07:56.721
I'm truly blown away.

1:07:56.823 --> 1:07:58.623
Awww. You're going
to make me blush.

1:07:59.226 --> 1:08:03.061
On another note, the kids are
going to miss you terribly.

1:08:03.163 --> 1:08:05.130
I'm going to miss them, too.

1:08:05.232 --> 1:08:06.731
And I'll miss you.

1:08:06.833 --> 1:08:07.966
Becoming friends
with you has been

1:08:08.068 --> 1:08:09.734
one of the best parts
about living here.

1:08:09.836 --> 1:08:12.003
And there are a lot of good
things about living here.

1:08:12.105 --> 1:08:14.305
Ah, you're going
to make me blush.

1:08:14.407 --> 1:08:17.075
I'll try to swing by and
visit the kids before I go.

1:08:19.112 --> 1:08:23.214
Any chance you could make
creek falls your home base?

1:08:23.316 --> 1:08:25.884
You could still go
and paint, travel,

1:08:25.986 --> 1:08:29.554
have big adventures but
just call this place home?

1:08:29.656 --> 1:08:36.227
I love creek falls but I
just have to follow my path.

1:08:36.329 --> 1:08:40.365
To be open to where the
road, my road, will take me.

1:08:40.934 --> 1:08:42.934
And nate.

1:08:43.637 --> 1:08:45.937
You don't see a path that
leads you back to him?

1:08:47.007 --> 1:08:50.108
No. Unfortunately, not.

1:08:50.210 --> 1:08:52.210
He's still in boston.

1:08:52.312 --> 1:08:54.078
I haven't heard from him.

1:08:54.181 --> 1:08:57.115
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
That's really unlike him.

1:08:57.217 --> 1:08:59.551
I was blind sided.

1:08:59.653 --> 1:09:01.853
I left my heart out there.

1:09:01.955 --> 1:09:03.955
Open.

1:09:04.057 --> 1:09:06.257
I'm so confused
about men now.

1:09:06.359 --> 1:09:08.393
Don't let nate
discourage you.

1:09:08.495 --> 1:09:10.595
There are a lot
of decent guys.

1:09:10.697 --> 1:09:13.298
There is someone for you.

1:09:13.733 --> 1:09:15.033
You're right.

1:09:15.135 --> 1:09:17.302
I'll meet my soul mate
out on the open road.

1:09:17.404 --> 1:09:18.903
That's very profound.

1:09:19.005 --> 1:09:21.239
But, tonight we celebrate!

1:09:25.011 --> 1:09:26.945
I'm going to get
us more champagne.

1:09:27.047 --> 1:09:28.213
Thank you.

1:09:31.852 --> 1:09:33.251
Vanessa!

1:09:33.353 --> 1:09:34.886
Wallace.

1:09:34.988 --> 1:09:36.621
You'll be pleased to know
that all your laboring

1:09:36.723 --> 1:09:37.956
has paid off.

1:09:38.058 --> 1:09:40.758
Everyone loves the mural.

1:09:41.494 --> 1:09:43.161
You should be proud.

1:09:43.263 --> 1:09:44.662
Thank you.

1:09:44.764 --> 1:09:46.798
I am really
proud of my work.

1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:50.501
But I'm also really proud to
be a part of this journey.

1:09:51.471 --> 1:09:54.005
It's quite an
amazing journey.

1:09:54.107 --> 1:09:57.041
Yeah.
I'm very grateful.

1:10:04.384 --> 1:10:05.917
Care to dance?

1:10:06.019 --> 1:10:07.619
I would love to dance.

1:10:07.721 --> 1:10:08.720
(both laugh)

1:10:10.624 --> 1:10:12.123
you know you still
owe me that tango lesson.

1:10:12.225 --> 1:10:13.124
I do. I do.

1:10:13.226 --> 1:10:14.158
Yeah, you do.

1:10:14.261 --> 1:10:15.927
-You're a very good dancer.
-Oh, thank you.

1:10:16.029 --> 1:10:17.028
(vanessa laughs)

1:10:19.532 --> 1:10:21.566
is that nate?
Nate!

1:10:29.576 --> 1:10:30.508
Hey.

1:10:30.610 --> 1:10:31.943
Hey, wallace.

1:10:32.045 --> 1:10:33.611
Nate.

1:10:37.150 --> 1:10:39.183
Excuse me.

1:10:45.125 --> 1:10:48.359
The mural is spectacular.

1:10:48.461 --> 1:10:49.560
Congratulations.

1:10:49.663 --> 1:10:50.795
Thanks.

1:10:54.334 --> 1:10:57.302
There's your
signature angel.

1:10:58.571 --> 1:11:01.839
She's always there when
someone needs strength.

1:11:10.283 --> 1:11:12.050
Your work is so famous.

1:11:12.152 --> 1:11:14.719
Why don't you just sign
it with your own name?

1:11:14.821 --> 1:11:18.656
I don't paint murals in
hospitals for attention, nate.

1:11:18.758 --> 1:11:21.225
And I don't do it for money.

1:11:21.328 --> 1:11:23.094
I do it to comfort
the patients

1:11:23.196 --> 1:11:25.229
and their families
and caregivers.

1:11:25.332 --> 1:11:28.700
To give them hope when
there is darkness.

1:11:28.802 --> 1:11:32.870
To remind them that they're
loved and they're not alone.

1:11:39.479 --> 1:11:42.447
So, you're leaving?

1:11:42.549 --> 1:11:44.615
Tomorrow.

1:11:50.824 --> 1:11:52.223
I'm going to go
find caroline.

1:11:52.325 --> 1:11:55.059
No. Please, vanessa.

1:11:55.829 --> 1:11:59.897
I know I don't deserve it,
after my little vanishing act.

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.766
But I would love
the opportunity

1:12:01.868 --> 1:12:04.135
to give you an
explanation.

1:12:10.410 --> 1:12:14.379
Okay. Okay.

1:12:26.026 --> 1:12:29.794
When I found out
taylor was pregnant,

1:12:29.896 --> 1:12:33.231
it really messed me up.

1:12:35.835 --> 1:12:40.271
I had been wanting a
family for so long.

1:12:40.373 --> 1:12:44.609
And she had been
resistant to that idea.

1:12:44.711 --> 1:12:49.080
And I realize now that
she just didn't want

1:12:49.182 --> 1:12:52.050
to have a
family with me.

1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.988
And I had to come
to terms with that.

1:12:57.090 --> 1:13:01.225
I wasn't the right
person for her.

1:13:01.327 --> 1:13:03.628
But more importantly,

1:13:03.730 --> 1:13:07.031
she wasn't the right
person for me, either.

1:13:07.133 --> 1:13:13.304
Vanessa, you've opened me
up to living life fully.

1:13:13.406 --> 1:13:18.509
And my life doesn't feel
full without you in it.

1:13:18.611 --> 1:13:22.713
You are my person, vanessa.

1:13:24.284 --> 1:13:29.454
Look.
I hear you.

1:13:29.556 --> 1:13:33.925
I just don't think I'm
that important to you.

1:13:34.027 --> 1:13:35.093
I mean, I let you in

1:13:35.195 --> 1:13:36.727
and you just left
without an explanation.

1:13:36.830 --> 1:13:37.829
You just left me here alone...

1:13:37.931 --> 1:13:41.165
I made a mistake.
I understand that.

1:13:41.267 --> 1:13:44.669
I was just so confused about
the list and the pills.

1:13:44.771 --> 1:13:48.172
But while I was away I
came to understand that

1:13:48.274 --> 1:13:51.709
it doesn't matter how
much time we have,

1:13:51.811 --> 1:13:55.146
just that we get to
spend it together.

1:13:58.384 --> 1:14:00.952
Time is so precious.

1:14:05.492 --> 1:14:08.826
I just don't know if
I want to invest it

1:14:08.928 --> 1:14:12.163
in someone who's
broken my trust.

1:14:16.703 --> 1:14:18.703
I'm sorry, nate.

1:14:33.286 --> 1:14:38.656
So she walked out of the
gala and I just stood there.

1:14:38.758 --> 1:14:40.691
Frozen.

1:14:42.395 --> 1:14:45.963
Any words of advice
for your idiot son?

1:14:46.065 --> 1:14:48.766
You've actually
shown great insight,

1:14:48.868 --> 1:14:52.570
even though you pretty much
crushed vanessa in the process.

1:14:53.139 --> 1:14:55.540
You are an evolved man.

1:14:55.642 --> 1:14:58.609
When I opened up to her, it
really didn't go very well.

1:14:58.711 --> 1:15:01.279
Did you hear me say crushed?

1:15:01.948 --> 1:15:04.482
But you spoke from your heart.
I'm sure she saw that.

1:15:04.584 --> 1:15:07.885
Just give it some time.
Give her some time.

1:15:07.987 --> 1:15:09.820
But she's leaving.

1:15:09.923 --> 1:15:12.723
She took a job in vermont.

1:15:12.825 --> 1:15:17.562
And truthfully, I don't know
how much time she has left.

1:15:19.465 --> 1:15:24.435
She actually seems to have
a whole new lease on life.

1:15:24.671 --> 1:15:26.537
What do you mean?

1:15:26.639 --> 1:15:30.575
She got some incredible news
from a doctor's appointment.

1:15:30.677 --> 1:15:31.943
She said it was
sad though because

1:15:32.045 --> 1:15:34.378
she didn't have anyone
to share it with.

1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:36.681
That girl has been
through so much.

1:15:42.021 --> 1:15:45.089
You're right.
You're right, mom!

1:15:45.692 --> 1:15:47.592
Right about what?

1:15:48.361 --> 1:15:49.594
Of course, I'm right.
I'm always right

1:15:49.696 --> 1:15:51.162
I'm your mother.

1:15:53.900 --> 1:15:55.333
It's open!

1:15:55.435 --> 1:15:57.768
<i> (door opens, closes)</i>

1:16:01.107 --> 1:16:02.940
hey vanessa.

1:16:04.110 --> 1:16:06.210
Mind if I come in?

1:16:06.312 --> 1:16:08.980
Well, you own the
place, so sure.

1:16:19.659 --> 1:16:21.425
Can we sit?

1:16:43.182 --> 1:16:48.085
So, ah, is it
quite a big mural

1:16:48.187 --> 1:16:52.023
that you're painting
in vermont?

1:16:52.859 --> 1:16:54.825
Very big.

1:16:54.927 --> 1:16:59.297
Ah, sounds... Tough.

1:17:06.072 --> 1:17:07.905
How've you been?

1:17:08.007 --> 1:17:10.441
Fine.

1:17:10.543 --> 1:17:14.979
My mom mentioned that
you'd gotten some news.

1:17:16.316 --> 1:17:19.317
Yeah. Some really
good news.

1:17:19.419 --> 1:17:22.219
You just won't let me in.

1:17:25.892 --> 1:17:29.927
I can see how, from
your perspective,

1:17:30.029 --> 1:17:33.998
that seems true.

1:17:34.100 --> 1:17:37.201
But I was only trying
to protect myself.

1:17:37.737 --> 1:17:40.037
And samantha.

1:17:41.274 --> 1:17:43.941
Who is samantha?

1:17:44.043 --> 1:17:45.476
I've heard you mention her.

1:17:45.578 --> 1:17:48.446
Was she your grandmother?

1:17:48.548 --> 1:17:51.849
No, she's not
my grandmother.

1:17:55.321 --> 1:17:58.456
She's my guardian angel.

1:17:58.558 --> 1:18:01.092
And I am her life.

1:18:02.562 --> 1:18:05.496
(nate)
<i> it's okay. It's okay.</i>

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:06.597
<i> (vanessa sobbing)</i>

1:18:06.699 --> 1:18:10.768
<i> samantha.</i>
<i> I miss you so much.</i>

1:18:12.605 --> 1:18:13.904
(nate)
it's okay.

1:18:17.310 --> 1:18:20.511
She knew her disease
was incurable

1:18:20.613 --> 1:18:26.550
and yet she spent all her
strength trying to help me.

1:18:26.886 --> 1:18:30.054
But that's the strength
I see in you everyday.

1:18:30.623 --> 1:18:33.958
That's the life that
we see in your murals.

1:18:36.562 --> 1:18:42.433
After, after she died, I
started to get better.

1:18:42.535 --> 1:18:44.502
And I went into remission.

1:18:44.604 --> 1:18:47.405
Your pills...

1:18:47.507 --> 1:18:50.007
I thought that
you were dying

1:18:50.109 --> 1:18:51.642
and that's what you
couldn't share with me.

1:18:51.744 --> 1:18:53.077
No. No no.

1:18:53.179 --> 1:18:56.247
The pills were to help me
rebuild my immune system

1:18:56.349 --> 1:18:59.250
after years of treatments.

1:18:59.352 --> 1:19:01.852
I was in remission but the
doctors weren't ready

1:19:01.954 --> 1:19:05.423
to give me a clean
bill of health.

1:19:05.525 --> 1:19:09.660
That's, that's the
news I got yesterday.

1:19:11.531 --> 1:19:14.965
And I wasn't here to
share that with you.

1:19:17.103 --> 1:19:18.836
I'm so sorry.

1:19:18.938 --> 1:19:20.805
It's okay.

1:19:22.175 --> 1:19:26.343
There's something else
that I haven't shared.

1:19:27.780 --> 1:19:30.748
When we first met,
I couldn't place

1:19:30.850 --> 1:19:33.784
where I'd seen your
art work before.

1:19:33.886 --> 1:19:36.086
I went online and
did some searching

1:19:36.189 --> 1:19:39.824
but none of it
really connected.

1:19:41.327 --> 1:19:48.365
Then at the gala, I saw
your mural and it clicked.

1:19:50.736 --> 1:19:54.839
My father was at a
hospital in delaware.

1:19:55.875 --> 1:19:58.375
You did a mural there.

1:19:58.478 --> 1:20:01.045
It must have been
one of your first.

1:20:01.814 --> 1:20:05.049
He mentioned it several
times and I remember

1:20:05.151 --> 1:20:08.219
wheeling him back to
his ward one time,

1:20:08.321 --> 1:20:11.689
he pointed out the
angel in the mural.

1:20:12.225 --> 1:20:17.728
Your angel gave my father
peace and tranquility

1:20:17.830 --> 1:20:20.197
in his final hours.

1:20:21.400 --> 1:20:24.101
She gave me peace.

1:20:24.804 --> 1:20:26.804
So you and I,

1:20:26.906 --> 1:20:29.840
we've been close even
though we never met.

1:20:30.910 --> 1:20:34.945
I'm the painter but sam
was always the angel.

1:20:35.047 --> 1:20:37.414
Well, she brought
us together.

1:20:37.517 --> 1:20:40.384
So she's my angel too.

1:20:42.955 --> 1:20:45.489
And I was so scared
when we started

1:20:45.591 --> 1:20:48.125
working through your list.

1:20:48.961 --> 1:20:54.698
The closer we got, the more
the idea of you dying,

1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:57.468
it engulfed me.

1:20:57.570 --> 1:20:59.303
I didn't know how to feel.

1:20:59.405 --> 1:21:01.805
But now I know.

1:21:02.642 --> 1:21:06.844
I know that I have fallen
completely in love with you

1:21:06.946 --> 1:21:09.680
and your spirit.

1:21:09.782 --> 1:21:12.550
You've changed how
I look at life

1:21:12.652 --> 1:21:15.786
and how precious our
moments are here.

1:21:16.222 --> 1:21:17.688
Life's short.

1:21:17.790 --> 1:21:20.157
I don't want to waste any
more time without you.

1:21:21.961 --> 1:21:24.762
Nate. I missed you so much.

1:21:33.272 --> 1:21:34.972
I'm yours.

1:21:35.074 --> 1:21:36.740
If you'll have me.

1:21:36.842 --> 1:21:41.612
Having you here right now,
hearing what you're saying,

1:21:41.714 --> 1:21:45.482
it's giving me more strength
than you could possibly imagine.

1:21:45.985 --> 1:21:49.753
But don't disappear
on me again. Please.

1:21:49.855 --> 1:21:52.723
I won't.
I promise

1:21:52.825 --> 1:21:54.992
I didn't mean to
run away on you.

1:21:55.094 --> 1:21:59.263
It was just about my past
and letting go of old dreams

1:21:59.365 --> 1:22:03.901
so that I could restart
and make new ones.

1:22:04.003 --> 1:22:06.704
To look forward
to the future.

1:22:08.975 --> 1:22:12.209
The future.

1:22:15.514 --> 1:22:18.549
Sam wrote the bucket list.

1:22:20.486 --> 1:22:22.086
All the items on the list

1:22:22.188 --> 1:22:24.722
are things that
she wanted for me.

1:22:24.824 --> 1:22:26.357
And I feel sad
doing them

1:22:26.459 --> 1:22:29.893
because she, she
never could.

1:22:29.996 --> 1:22:32.796
She wouldn't want
you to feel sad.

1:22:33.899 --> 1:22:36.734
It's especially
the last two.

1:22:36.836 --> 1:22:42.206
To fall in love
and get married.

1:22:42.308 --> 1:22:48.212
They break me because she
never got to meet her person.

1:22:48.314 --> 1:22:52.483
Never got to feel the
way I feel about you.

1:22:53.486 --> 1:22:56.787
But she'd want
you to feel that.

1:22:56.889 --> 1:23:00.591
Yeah. She would.

1:23:12.004 --> 1:23:14.371
I love you.

1:23:14.473 --> 1:23:16.840
I love your laugh
and your smile

1:23:16.942 --> 1:23:19.209
and your art and
your passion.

1:23:19.311 --> 1:23:20.210
And and and...

1:23:20.312 --> 1:23:21.612
I love you too.

1:23:22.848 --> 1:23:24.648
I love you too.

1:23:26.886 --> 1:23:35.125
So, maybe we could make
creek falls our home base.

1:23:35.227 --> 1:23:37.494
You could travel
for your projects.

1:23:37.596 --> 1:23:39.496
I could travel
for my projects.

1:23:39.598 --> 1:23:44.935
And we could get started
on a combined list.

1:23:45.037 --> 1:23:46.303
What?

1:23:47.139 --> 1:23:48.539
Number one.

1:23:48.641 --> 1:23:50.407
Oh, looks like this
one's just for me.

1:23:51.877 --> 1:23:55.312
'find the most beautiful
girl in the world...'

1:23:59.952 --> 1:24:02.252
'and propose to her.'

1:24:12.064 --> 1:24:13.997
will you marry me?

1:24:14.100 --> 1:24:17.301
Yeah! Yes! Yes!

1:24:20.506 --> 1:24:23.574
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

1:24:23.676 --> 1:24:26.710
Living our very own list.

1:24:26.812 --> 1:24:27.811
(they both laugh)

1:24:28.781 --> 1:24:30.981
I think samantha
would like that.

1:24:31.083 --> 1:24:33.283
I think she would love that.
