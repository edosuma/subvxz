00:36.883 --> 00:38.214
Yes, Walt.

00:40.153 --> 00:42.178
I'm still in the meeting.

00:45.325 --> 00:47.657
Do you think
I want to be here?

00:49.563 --> 00:51.463
I got to go. Bye.

01:18.825 --> 01:20.417
Yes.
Is this the MSEU?

01:20.961 --> 01:24.954
My name is Liana, and I'm
calling from the City Council.

01:25.399 --> 01:26.923
My boss is trying
to return a call,

01:27.000 --> 01:29.093
but our temp
garbled the message.

01:29.169 --> 01:31.364
The name I have for sure
is Anya.

01:32.406 --> 01:34.135
Yes, at union headquarters.

01:44.951 --> 01:46.543
Walt, I'm home.

01:52.225 --> 01:54.693
You're late. Again.

01:55.862 --> 01:57.159
You know how it is.

01:57.230 --> 02:00.666
Trying to get everything done
before the long weekend.

02:05.572 --> 02:08.301
Give them that
"I'll protect you" smile.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.741
It's not mine, Janice.

02:21.321 --> 02:24.552
What? I'm tied up here. This
damn well better be an emergency.

02:26.393 --> 02:28.327
Everything okay,
Frank?

02:28.395 --> 02:33.059
Something's come up. I'll
call you later. Thanks!

02:34.401 --> 02:35.959
Oh, man...

02:36.036 --> 02:38.334
Geez, the stench
off of this one.

02:38.405 --> 02:41.272
Check his hand out,
something's wrong with it.

02:42.042 --> 02:43.805
It's all scarred up.

02:44.744 --> 02:47.076
The union lady from the
Missing Persons this morning,

02:47.147 --> 02:49.581
her husband's hand
had burn scars.

03:38.932 --> 03:41.400
Mr. Czabo was reported
missing by his wife yesterday.

03:41.468 --> 03:44.631
The last time she saw him was
four days ago, Thursday night.

03:45.438 --> 03:47.406
She spent the Easter
weekend at her sister's.

03:47.474 --> 03:49.999
It looks like he spent it
at the bottom of a bottle.

03:50.076 --> 03:52.271
There's no wounds, no
visible cause of death.

03:52.345 --> 03:54.108
And he came all the way
from Queens

03:54.180 --> 03:57.343
because the Thunderbird's
cheaper up here in Harlem?

03:57.417 --> 04:00.045
Hey, you're the guys
with the big ideas.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.644
His wife's
a union mucky-muck?

04:01.721 --> 04:03.916
VP, Municipal Service
Employees.

04:04.624 --> 04:07.354
He's a maintenance engineer
at Montebello Hospital.

04:07.427 --> 04:08.951
He's all yours now.

04:09.696 --> 04:13.689
He's been here a while.
Rigor's come and gone.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.428
His arm was out like this
when you found him?

04:15.502 --> 04:17.367
Yes, sir. Sticking out of the bushes.

04:17.437 --> 04:18.995
They went to the trouble
of stuffing him in here,

04:19.072 --> 04:20.699
why not
tuck his arm in?

04:21.975 --> 04:25.342
Look, it's efflorescence
from the concrete.

04:26.079 --> 04:29.014
His arm
was up like this,

04:29.983 --> 04:34.010
already in rigor when
they stuffed him in here.

04:35.155 --> 04:39.216
Then the rigor passed,
the arm dropped down.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.725
So, he spent time
somewhere else

04:40.794 --> 04:42.853
before they
shoved him in here.

04:43.630 --> 04:45.928
I'm feeling
broken ribs.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.832
He's been worked over, but
there's not a mark on his face.

04:48.902 --> 04:50.802
It's the work of a pro.

04:54.874 --> 04:58.332
Yesterday morning,
I drove straight to work

04:59.279 --> 05:01.611
from my sister's in Goshen.

05:02.749 --> 05:05.411
I tried Walter
at the hospital,

05:05.485 --> 05:07.453
but they said
he hadn't come in.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.715
You didn't speak
all weekend?

05:10.190 --> 05:12.715
I left messages.
He didn't call back.

05:13.893 --> 05:15.690
You weren't
worried?

05:15.762 --> 05:19.562
Worried?
No. Walt's like that.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.267
But when I came home
Monday night,

05:23.370 --> 05:25.531
his car was here,
but he wasn't.

05:26.306 --> 05:28.501
The left side
of your face is

05:29.943 --> 05:31.240
puffed up.

05:32.646 --> 05:34.204
Did someone hit you?

05:34.280 --> 05:36.043
No, no.

05:36.116 --> 05:38.949
I tripped on the stairs.

05:39.119 --> 05:42.486
Mrs. Czabo, the reason you went
to your sister's on Thursday...

05:43.556 --> 05:45.751
Your husband beat you,
didn't he?

05:48.595 --> 05:50.290
I just...

05:52.098 --> 05:53.963
It's so embarrassing.

05:56.169 --> 06:00.572
Walt, when he was drinking,
he had a temper.

06:01.174 --> 06:04.803
And what set him off
on Thursday?

06:06.780 --> 06:10.876
This time? Because I
got home late from work.

06:12.686 --> 06:14.916
He feels bad
after he hits me,

06:14.988 --> 06:18.014
so he went to his bar
in Sunnyside.

06:18.925 --> 06:20.893
I waited for him
to leave and...

06:20.960 --> 06:23.428
And you hid at your
sister's all weekend.

06:24.030 --> 06:27.659
And when he left for the bar,
he took his car?

06:27.734 --> 06:28.894
Yes.

06:28.968 --> 06:33.337
Did Missing Persons search it
when they took your report?

06:37.544 --> 06:40.809
Stub from a parking lot
in Sunnyside.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.872
Walter made it to the bar. Maybe
he brought home some trouble.

06:45.952 --> 06:46.941
I got it.

06:52.492 --> 06:56.121
Hydrocodone. 10 milligrams.

06:57.597 --> 07:02.091
Dilaudid. No prescription
label. What do you think?

07:02.535 --> 07:06.471
I'm thinking, not for nothing
Walter worked in a hospital.

07:06.539 --> 07:09.440
He was running a
pharmacy out of his trunk.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.642
Maybe he ran into
a dissatisfied customer.

07:14.781 --> 07:18.114
No one at his bar copped to
knowing about Walter's sideline.

07:18.184 --> 07:21.210
They said he came in
Thursday around 9:00, alone,

07:21.287 --> 07:23.915
drank until 1:00, alone,
left alone.

07:23.990 --> 07:24.979
And the parking lot?

07:25.058 --> 07:27.049
The lot attendant
left at 11:00.

07:27.427 --> 07:31.261
Maybe one of Walter's customers
was waiting for him at home.

07:32.398 --> 07:35.299
The ME counted over
a dozen separate body blows,

07:35.368 --> 07:36.960
each one
to a major organ.

07:37.036 --> 07:38.697
Not a movement wasted.

07:38.838 --> 07:40.499
Except the move
to Harlem.

07:40.573 --> 07:41.938
What did that
buy them?

07:42.008 --> 07:43.737
Time.

07:44.244 --> 07:48.681
The lab found engine oil and transmission
fluid on the back of his jacket.

07:49.949 --> 07:53.112
Now, there was a vacant lot
across the street.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.346
Here, across on this corner.
There were a few abandoned cars.

07:57.423 --> 07:58.651
This intersection.

07:58.725 --> 08:02.957
The 35, the 29, and the 38 all butt
up against each other right there.

08:03.029 --> 08:05.623
Looks like Walter
took a grand tour.

08:07.066 --> 08:10.194
It was a holiday weekend,
everybody wanted to get home.

08:13.139 --> 08:16.973
Call the desk sergeants, see
what sector crews were on patrol.

08:21.948 --> 08:24.678
This one
has the most authority.

08:25.952 --> 08:28.284
Frank, it can't
go on like this.

08:28.988 --> 08:31.957
Frank Adair,
good to see you again.

08:32.725 --> 08:34.453
You, too,
Ms. Steiner.

08:34.527 --> 08:38.258
I thank God every day we have
people like Frank Adair on our side.

08:38.331 --> 08:39.491
You're our man, Frank.

08:39.566 --> 08:40.999
Thank you, Congressman.

08:44.671 --> 08:47.265
He's sucking up.
That's a good sign.

08:49.108 --> 08:50.132
You have to
put an end to it.

08:50.210 --> 08:52.508
Janice, it's over.

08:52.579 --> 08:54.479
For you. Not for her.

08:56.349 --> 09:00.046
She has leverage now.
She's a cancer to you.

09:03.122 --> 09:06.023
Mr. Czabo was last seen in
Queens on Thursday night,

09:06.092 --> 09:09.425
so we need to nail down how
he got where he was found.

09:09.495 --> 09:13.693
Because his jacket was soaked
in motor oil on the back.

09:13.766 --> 09:15.427
His shoe, he was missing a shoe,

09:15.501 --> 09:17.128
turned up over there
in that lot.

09:17.203 --> 09:20.001
You know, we can't figure out
how he got from your precinct,

09:20.073 --> 09:23.804
the 35, to the 29
over here.

09:23.877 --> 09:26.141
Maybe the Easter Wino
helped him across the street.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.540
That's funny.

09:28.615 --> 09:31.709
Your shift ended around
midnight on Good Friday.

09:31.784 --> 09:34.685
Mr. Czabo would've
been in full rigor.

09:34.754 --> 09:37.917
Before they shoved him
into that wall there.

09:37.991 --> 09:38.980
You know what I think?

09:39.058 --> 09:40.525
I think that,
you know, it was Easter,

09:40.593 --> 09:42.993
and it was
the end of a long shift.

09:43.062 --> 09:45.087
Mr. Czabo,
for all appearances,

09:45.164 --> 09:47.155
was a wino who drank himself to death.

09:47.233 --> 09:51.260
Who wants to spend five hours
baby-sitting a stiff, filling out paper,

09:51.337 --> 09:53.430
when you can be home
with your family?

09:53.506 --> 09:55.098
You couldn't leave
him on your turf,

09:55.174 --> 09:57.301
so you walked him
over to the 29.

09:58.611 --> 09:59.942
We get it.

10:01.447 --> 10:02.607
But we're gonna
need a timeline,

10:02.682 --> 10:05.207
gonna need a diagram,
location of the body.

10:08.054 --> 10:10.284
I might have that
in my notes.

10:13.526 --> 10:17.087
Whoever dumped Czabo here
picked his spot.

10:17.163 --> 10:20.894
Precinct boundaries, holiday
weekend. Bought himself a lot of time.

10:20.967 --> 10:24.027
He might know something
about police procedure.

10:25.071 --> 10:27.801
He knows something
about police culture.

10:28.474 --> 10:30.499
Only one way to know that.

10:34.948 --> 10:37.416
Drug dealing?
Walter? I...

10:39.552 --> 10:42.953
It's possible. He had keys
to the whole hospital. But...

10:44.457 --> 10:46.721
I had no idea. None.

10:46.793 --> 10:48.624
Can you think of
any friends of his,

10:48.695 --> 10:50.356
people he brought
to the house?

10:50.430 --> 10:53.263
No one's been to the
house since forever.

10:54.434 --> 10:57.699
Do they have to... This
is all my union stuff.

10:57.770 --> 11:01.706
Walter's area was
basically the chair.

11:01.774 --> 11:02.900
And the TV.

11:02.976 --> 11:04.443
They'll be careful.

11:04.877 --> 11:09.974
So, he was sitting here when
you came home Thursday night?

11:10.049 --> 11:13.041
I knew I was in trouble because
he got up when I came in.

11:13.119 --> 11:15.314
Walt wouldn't get up
for the Queen of England.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.913
He ever mention knowing
anybody on the Force?

11:19.058 --> 11:20.923
There are always
cops in the E.R.

11:20.994 --> 11:22.791
He might have
talked about them?

11:22.862 --> 11:24.625
No, he never said.

11:27.667 --> 11:31.000
Fell between the cushions.
It's got your handwriting.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.004
It's addressed to "Bear. "
Who's Bear?

11:38.711 --> 11:40.736
God...

11:40.813 --> 11:43.213
This'll seem pathetic.

11:43.282 --> 11:47.082
I tried to leave Walter
little notes in the morning.

11:47.153 --> 11:49.383
I read where it would spice things up.

11:49.455 --> 11:51.923
Well, don't believe
everything you read.

11:52.258 --> 11:55.489
Are you getting
arrested in this photo?

11:55.561 --> 11:57.358
At the Republican
Convention.

11:57.430 --> 11:59.295
That must've been
an experience, huh?

11:59.465 --> 12:01.126
They hold you in the pier?

12:01.267 --> 12:02.962
No, just the local precinct.

12:06.873 --> 12:09.000
If you show them
where things are upstairs,

12:09.075 --> 12:11.134
might save you
on the clean up.

12:14.714 --> 12:15.874
Local precinct?

12:15.948 --> 12:17.677
If you got arrested
during the convention,

12:17.750 --> 12:20.378
you spent three days on the
floor of the bus station.

12:22.388 --> 12:25.687
Yeah, but we checked
her record, she's clean.

12:26.826 --> 12:30.023
Unless they pulled her
before she was processed.

12:30.096 --> 12:33.532
Sounds like she's the one
with the friend on the Force.

12:33.599 --> 12:34.861
Getting sprung
during the convention

12:34.934 --> 12:36.162
would've taken
a lot of juice.

12:36.235 --> 12:37.862
We talked to the patrolman
who released her.

12:37.937 --> 12:40.963
He said some guy
flashed a gold shield,

12:41.040 --> 12:43.634
said somebody made a
mistake and to fix it.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.301
The patrolman
had to let her go.

12:45.378 --> 12:47.744
I take it Anya didn't mention
knowing any gold shields.

12:47.814 --> 12:49.247
No, she didn't.

12:49.315 --> 12:52.580
Walter was sitting in that
chair, waiting for her,

12:53.853 --> 12:57.289
balling up that note,
working himself up.

12:57.356 --> 12:59.221
It wasn't for him.

12:59.292 --> 13:01.226
"Bear" might be
her gold shield.

13:01.294 --> 13:03.455
So Walter
beat her up over it.

13:03.830 --> 13:07.027
Maybe her gold shield
fixed that mistake, too?

13:07.100 --> 13:08.089
Any prints on the note?

13:08.167 --> 13:12.194
Three sets, Walter's, Anya's,
and a third not yet identified.

13:16.642 --> 13:17.973
Deakins.

13:18.744 --> 13:20.075
Right now?

13:20.947 --> 13:22.847
Okay, thanks.

13:22.915 --> 13:26.407
Speaking of juice,
brace yourselves.

13:26.786 --> 13:28.185
Hey, nice
to see you.

13:28.254 --> 13:29.516
You, too.

13:30.189 --> 13:31.315
How are you?

13:31.457 --> 13:32.617
Hey, nice to see you.

13:32.692 --> 13:33.681
Nice to see you, too.

13:33.759 --> 13:34.748
Very nice.

13:34.827 --> 13:36.818
Jimmy.
Hey, Frank.

13:36.896 --> 13:39.387
Looking good for a lifer.
What's with the pirate patch?

13:39.465 --> 13:41.262
A long story
about nothing.

13:41.334 --> 13:42.392
You putting on
some pounds?

13:42.468 --> 13:43.867
Private sector pounds.

13:43.936 --> 13:45.233
Hi, Frank Adair.

13:45.304 --> 13:47.431
Detectives Eames
and Goren.

13:47.507 --> 13:50.772
Eames. You're not related
to Johnny Eames from the 91?

13:50.843 --> 13:51.935
My father.

13:52.011 --> 13:54.605
Carrying on the tradition. I like that.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.409
Your office, Jimmy?

13:56.983 --> 13:59.383
It's okay, this involves them, too.

14:01.621 --> 14:03.248
You've been asking
about a dropped arrest

14:03.322 --> 14:05.813
at the convention,
Anya Czabo?

14:06.792 --> 14:09.556
I don't want some patrolman
taking the rap for doing his job.

14:09.629 --> 14:10.994
I'm the one
got her sprung.

14:11.063 --> 14:12.052
She a family friend?

14:14.233 --> 14:16.428
I want to
clear the air, okay?

14:16.502 --> 14:18.470
This doesn't
leave the room, right?

14:20.940 --> 14:24.000
Anya and I, we met a few
years ago, some city ceremony.

14:24.076 --> 14:25.566
Back when Marie
and I were separated.

14:25.645 --> 14:27.078
I remember that.

14:27.146 --> 14:29.614
Anya was single,
you fill in the blanks.

14:29.682 --> 14:33.675
Long story short, last summer she
called me, said she'd been arrested.

14:33.753 --> 14:34.913
I knew nobody
was getting released

14:34.987 --> 14:37.421
until the President left,
so I pulled her out.

14:37.823 --> 14:40.758
Me, alone. Okay?

14:42.128 --> 14:44.187
Thanks for clearing
that up, Frank.

14:46.065 --> 14:49.364
After Anya's arrest... Your
phone's vibrating again.

14:49.435 --> 14:51.960
After Anya's arrest, did
you keep in touch with her?

14:52.038 --> 14:54.734
Not till last week, when
I heard about her husband.

14:54.807 --> 14:56.900
I called to
offer my condolences.

14:56.976 --> 14:59.672
She tell you we think he
might have been dealing drugs?

15:00.880 --> 15:04.145
Hey, any questions,
ask 'em.

15:04.984 --> 15:07.646
Nothing would surprise me
about that guy.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.950
I still know some people
from my buy-and-bust days.

15:10.022 --> 15:11.182
I'll ask around.
Appreciate it.

15:12.358 --> 15:13.552
Left jacket pocket, it's...

15:15.261 --> 15:17.252
Anya, she tell you
about a note

15:17.330 --> 15:20.356
that we found in her house, a love note?

15:20.700 --> 15:22.930
It was addressed to
someone nicknamed "Bear. "

15:24.370 --> 15:27.862
I don't know who that is.
I have to take this.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.771
One second.

15:29.842 --> 15:31.867
Been too long, Jimmy.
Dinner on me.

15:31.944 --> 15:33.411
You got it.

15:34.247 --> 15:35.271
Yes, Your Honor,
I'm looking forward...

15:35.348 --> 15:37.077
That guy sure knows
how to work a room.

15:37.149 --> 15:38.173
Yeah, he likes
the show,

15:38.251 --> 15:41.084
but he's the best street cop
that never made commissioner.

15:41.153 --> 15:42.245
Great instincts,
that guy.

15:42.321 --> 15:44.312
I'll say. He knew just when to come in.

15:44.390 --> 15:47.154
He told us he didn't know who
Bear was without even being asked.

15:47.226 --> 15:49.456
He looks like
a bear to me.

15:50.196 --> 15:52.926
If Anya told him Walter was beating
her, he might've come running,

15:52.999 --> 15:54.489
killed Walter in a rage.

15:54.634 --> 15:56.124
In a rage?

15:56.202 --> 15:59.763
You saw him, sharp creases,
that's how he lives his life.

15:59.839 --> 16:01.568
He's straight-up,
clean as a whistle.

16:01.641 --> 16:03.404
He's got three cell phones, two pagers,

16:03.476 --> 16:07.913
not including the BlackBerry
hooked to his belt.

16:07.980 --> 16:09.311
He leads
a complicated life.

16:09.382 --> 16:11.976
If he says the affair was
over, that's good enough for me.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.217
The third set of prints
on the love note?

16:15.288 --> 16:17.256
They turned up on
the immigration database.

16:17.323 --> 16:19.757
They belong to
a Fortunata Lelisa.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.285
She's loyal.
It's a non-issue.

16:23.362 --> 16:25.023
The issue is,
how did that note

16:25.097 --> 16:26.189
get into their hands
in the first place?

16:28.734 --> 16:30.395
Ready for you in one,
Mr. Adair.

16:30.469 --> 16:32.403
We can read a clock,
sweet pea.

16:38.878 --> 16:40.209
Anya...

16:41.480 --> 16:43.004
She wouldn't
be so reckless.

16:43.082 --> 16:46.279
Why not? She set
her own house on fire.

16:47.787 --> 16:49.516
It's the same reason
she married Walter.

16:49.588 --> 16:52.386
She knew your good heart, she
knew you wouldn't abandon her.

16:52.458 --> 16:53.447
And now
with Walter gone,

16:53.526 --> 16:56.051
she needs some other way
to keep her hooks in you.

16:56.128 --> 16:57.322
<i>When we come back,</i>

16:57.396 --> 17:00.832
<i>my guest will be one of New York's
most decorated police officers,</i>

17:00.900 --> 17:02.299
<i>the former
Chief of Detectives,</i>

17:02.368 --> 17:05.462
<i>security adviser to two
Mayors and one President,</i>

17:05.538 --> 17:09.201
<i>and now head of his own international
security consulting firm,</i>

17:09.275 --> 17:10.674
<i>Frank Adair.</i>

17:11.577 --> 17:15.069
Save yourself,
Frank, your family.

17:16.816 --> 17:18.078
Save what you love.

17:24.457 --> 17:27.153
I find the note,
I put it on the table.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.061
Have you ever seen
these people here before?

17:32.898 --> 17:37.597
No trace of human life. Unless you
count the clown art on the walls.

17:40.773 --> 17:45.301
Fresh paint. And the carpet new, too?

17:46.445 --> 17:47.673
When did that happen?

17:47.813 --> 17:49.041
Last weekend.

17:49.115 --> 17:52.642
Building owner sent in a crew.
Probably looking to sell it.

17:52.718 --> 17:55.050
Right now
it's warehoused.

17:55.121 --> 17:57.646
They sanitized
the sugar shack.

17:57.723 --> 18:00.521
Tying up loose ends. It's what
a guy like Frank Adair would do.

18:00.593 --> 18:04.393
I'd like to hear Anya explain how
her note to Walter ended up here.

18:06.565 --> 18:07.964
Mrs. Czabo?

18:08.033 --> 18:11.002
There's a couple of
days' worth of mail here.

18:15.341 --> 18:16.933
Excuse me.

18:18.511 --> 18:20.138
Have you seen
Mrs. Czabo?

18:20.212 --> 18:24.444
She drove off in her car Saturday
night. I was walking slowpoke here.

18:24.517 --> 18:26.109
She take
anything with her?

18:26.185 --> 18:29.746
Couple of suitcases. Said
she'd be back yesterday morning.

18:29.822 --> 18:33.519
Two suitcases for a day trip.
There goes another loose end.

18:38.264 --> 18:39.288
After 9l11,

18:39.365 --> 18:42.732
I donated the use of that apartment
to the anti-terrorist task force.

18:42.802 --> 18:45.293
A place to take a shower,
catch a nap.

18:45.371 --> 18:47.965
I hope the Department
showed its appreciation.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.668
They made me honorary
Chief of Detectives.

18:50.743 --> 18:52.438
Chief of Ds? Really?

18:53.679 --> 18:55.442
They give you a badge?

18:57.583 --> 18:59.517
Let me see that thing.
Yeah.

18:59.585 --> 19:01.553
Wow, this is nice.

19:02.521 --> 19:04.512
The Chief of Detectives back
then was Frank Adair, wasn't it?

19:04.590 --> 19:06.217
He present this to you?

19:06.292 --> 19:07.418
Yes.

19:08.260 --> 19:09.727
Does he get to
use the apartment?

19:09.795 --> 19:11.285
Mr. Leonidas
loans the apartment

19:11.363 --> 19:14.059
to out-of-town clients,
business partners.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.101
Business partners?

19:16.168 --> 19:19.695
Your résumé shows you're on the
board of Frank's security company.

19:19.772 --> 19:22.673
That makes him
a business partner.

19:22.741 --> 19:27.371
Now, has he ever brought
this woman to the apartment?

19:29.014 --> 19:30.675
We're though here.

19:31.150 --> 19:32.208
Let me just say,

19:32.284 --> 19:36.516
I feel privileged a hero like
Frank Adair considers me his friend.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.887
Well, he counts
on people like you,

19:38.958 --> 19:43.019
who like rubbing shoulders
with big law-enforcement types.

19:43.095 --> 19:44.357
Pretty soon they're
covering up evidence,

19:44.430 --> 19:47.456
you know, painting, new carpeting.

19:48.267 --> 19:51.725
This woman he was seeing. Her
husband was murdered two weeks ago.

19:58.777 --> 20:02.110
Frank gave him a badge,
now he's a friend for life.

20:02.181 --> 20:04.411
Frank buttered up a lot
of big wigs with those.

20:04.483 --> 20:05.541
Any word
on Mrs. Czabo?

20:05.618 --> 20:06.983
No one's heard from her.

20:07.052 --> 20:09.543
She hasn't used her phone
or her credit cards.

20:09.622 --> 20:13.114
I wouldn't count on her
showing up anytime soon.

20:13.192 --> 20:16.958
She's the only person that could
tie Frank to her husband's death.

20:17.029 --> 20:18.018
Whoa, whoa...

20:18.097 --> 20:20.588
Hey, look, they were
having an affair.

20:21.534 --> 20:22.865
Her husband knew it.

20:22.935 --> 20:24.402
If she left
the note in the apartment,

20:24.470 --> 20:26.597
how did it end up
in Walter's hands?

20:26.672 --> 20:30.073
We can ask Frank,
with the gloves off.

20:30.142 --> 20:32.804
Keep your gloves on,
Frank's a black belt.

20:35.114 --> 20:36.308
I'll talk to him.

20:39.051 --> 20:40.951
Marie, it's Jimmy.

20:41.053 --> 20:43.112
Jimmy! Oh, I'm a mess.

20:43.255 --> 20:45.485
Gee, Frank didn't tell me
you were coming. How are you?

20:45.558 --> 20:47.389
Good.
You look great.

20:47.459 --> 20:49.950
How come she doesn't age, and we do?

20:50.029 --> 20:51.929
You're all liars.
Hey...

20:53.566 --> 20:54.794
Can I get you
anything?

20:54.867 --> 20:56.129
No, I'm good.

20:57.303 --> 20:58.964
What, you wear
glasses now?

20:59.038 --> 21:00.027
Ah...

21:01.206 --> 21:02.764
They're not real.

21:02.841 --> 21:04.240
I was on CNN.

21:04.310 --> 21:06.938
My media advisor,
she says they project depth.

21:09.748 --> 21:11.739
Between you and me,
I look like a sissy.

21:11.817 --> 21:15.446
Media advisors, CNN.
You running for something?

21:15.521 --> 21:18.285
Well, what are you gonna do?
Play the game.

21:18.357 --> 21:20.052
Guess so.

21:20.125 --> 21:23.390
Anya Czabo's
been missing four days.

21:24.430 --> 21:28.264
She has family
in Delaware.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.597
We're taking care of it.

21:30.669 --> 21:33.502
This is the note, the one
my detectives mentioned.

21:34.206 --> 21:37.539
It was traced to an apartment
owned by Marty Leonidas.

21:37.610 --> 21:39.202
You ever used it?

21:40.012 --> 21:44.449
Yes, for meetings with foreign
clients. They like the privacy.

21:45.150 --> 21:48.984
But this note, anyone who's
told you I've seen it is lying.

21:49.555 --> 21:50.681
Any idea how
something like this

21:50.756 --> 21:52.451
might end up
in Walter Czabo's hands?

21:53.125 --> 21:54.183
No.

21:55.227 --> 21:56.216
No idea.

21:57.129 --> 22:01.589
Because on the outside it might look
like he had evidence of an affair,

22:01.667 --> 22:03.225
and then him
turning up dead.

22:07.339 --> 22:10.069
If I'm gonna be out
on a limb for you, Frank,

22:10.142 --> 22:12.975
I need to know about
Anya and that apartment.

22:13.045 --> 22:15.980
I'm a happily married man.
Look at me.

22:17.282 --> 22:18.806
Nothing happened there.

22:20.519 --> 22:21.918
That's all I need to know.

22:23.822 --> 22:26.188
Marie, Jimmy's leaving.

22:26.258 --> 22:28.488
Next time bring Angie,
we'll have dinner.

22:28.761 --> 22:30.854
That would be great.
Good to see you.

22:30.929 --> 22:33.693
I hope she's not mad at Frank for
keeping you out so late Friday.

22:33.766 --> 22:36.166
Isn't the veal at Toniolo's to die for?

22:36.235 --> 22:38.897
Oh, yeah. Terrific grub. Take care.

22:39.204 --> 22:41.399
I'll see you.

22:44.843 --> 22:46.276
Sorry about that.

22:46.612 --> 22:48.045
About what?

22:49.915 --> 22:53.180
If I make it to Albany,
I'm gonna need good people.

23:04.029 --> 23:05.826
Frank Adair's planning
a run for governor.

23:05.898 --> 23:08.162
You might be looking at
his future Chief of Staff.

23:09.034 --> 23:11.798
Uh... Congratulations?

23:11.870 --> 23:15.772
Yeah, it'll be great, as long
as I don't mind being his beard.

23:17.576 --> 23:20.773
He told his wife he was out
late with me last Friday night.

23:20.846 --> 23:23.280
The night before
Anya disappeared.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.948
He knew that
she was on our radar.

23:26.018 --> 23:27.849
He wouldn't risk
being seen with her.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.285
Assuming they were
having an affair.

23:29.421 --> 23:30.786
No assuming.

23:30.856 --> 23:32.949
He was seeing her
at the apartment.

23:33.025 --> 23:35.255
Friday night,
he was with somebody else.

23:35.461 --> 23:38.624
He's juggling three women.
What a guy.

23:38.864 --> 23:41.264
He did a news show
Friday night.

23:41.333 --> 23:44.598
His media advisor would've
been holding his hand.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.467
Maybe she knows
where he went after.

23:47.639 --> 23:48.628
You imbeciles.

23:48.707 --> 23:49.833
You put the podium
down here,

23:49.908 --> 23:52.468
when you have the entire
museum to play with?

23:52.544 --> 23:54.705
Start over.
Liana, make notes.

23:54.780 --> 23:56.839
I don't usually talk to
the police about my clients.

23:56.915 --> 23:59.145
Your client happens to be
a hero to us, Ms. Steiner.

23:59.218 --> 24:01.209
He even remembered what
precinct my dad worked.

24:01.286 --> 24:02.776
Oh, how sweet.

24:02.855 --> 24:04.584
I'm surprised you wouldn't talk to us.

24:04.656 --> 24:06.624
Given his history
with this missing woman,

24:06.692 --> 24:07.989
it could get
sticky for Frank.

24:08.060 --> 24:11.393
Nothing sticks to Frank Adair.
He's a natural-born leader.

24:11.463 --> 24:13.727
And that's what this event that
you're planning is all about?

24:13.799 --> 24:15.824
I mean, all this
animal energy,

24:15.901 --> 24:19.200
leopards and elephants...
That's a lynx, isn't it?

24:19.271 --> 24:20.704
I wouldn't know.
I'm not a cat person.

24:20.773 --> 24:22.502
It is. It's a caracal.

24:24.143 --> 24:27.112
All these images of
strength, compassion.

24:27.179 --> 24:29.010
This would be
a great place for Frank

24:29.081 --> 24:31.072
to announce his run
for governor.

24:31.383 --> 24:33.510
The public craves
what Frank has to offer.

24:33.585 --> 24:35.348
Last Friday,
he did a news show.

24:35.420 --> 24:37.149
We need his whereabouts later on.

24:37.256 --> 24:39.656
Friday night,
Frank was with me.

24:39.725 --> 24:41.784
We brought a tape back
to my office to review it.

24:41.860 --> 24:45.421
Hmm. That's funny, he told his
wife he had dinner at Toniolo's.

24:45.764 --> 24:47.288
She misunderstood.

24:47.366 --> 24:50.358
We brought dinner in from Toniolo's.
We had a lot of work to do.

24:50.435 --> 24:53.768
This is Carla. Hold,
please. I have Ms. Regan.

24:53.839 --> 24:56.205
I envy Frank, you know,

24:56.275 --> 24:57.640
having you
by his side, you know,

24:57.709 --> 24:59.540
smoothing out
all the rough edges.

25:00.145 --> 25:02.875
The two of you make
a great power couple.

25:03.482 --> 25:05.040
He already has a wife.

25:05.951 --> 25:08.283
Judith. Yes, you wanted
to talk to me about...

25:08.353 --> 25:12.255
Two stories about Friday.
His is a total lie.

25:12.724 --> 25:15.557
Hers has enough truth in it
to make it bulletproof.

25:16.895 --> 25:19.227
It's the sign of a good liar,
you know, a good manipulator.

25:19.298 --> 25:22.028
Liana!
Damn it, my water!

25:22.100 --> 25:23.158
She calls you Liana?

25:23.235 --> 25:24.224
I know.

25:24.303 --> 25:26.771
I'm Carla. Liana was
let go two weeks ago.

25:27.005 --> 25:29.269
Ms. Steiner has
a lot of turnover.

25:30.108 --> 25:31.200
Liana.
Hmm.

25:31.276 --> 25:34.370
Hell has no fury like
an assistant scorned.

25:38.317 --> 25:42.048
Oh, the stories I could tell.
I don't care if she sues me.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.985
Tell us a story
about Frank Adair.

25:44.056 --> 25:46.081
Anything between
them besides business?

25:46.391 --> 25:47.483
You tell me.

25:47.559 --> 25:50.289
She always shut the door when
she talked to him on the phone.

25:50.362 --> 25:54.230
Which was weird, because that
woman's got, like, no boundaries.

25:54.299 --> 25:56.460
When she had sinus
surgery last Christmas,

25:56.535 --> 25:58.093
she made me
cancel my vacation

25:58.170 --> 26:01.162
just to come stay with her
and do her errands.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.802
Sinus surgery.
That's painful.

26:04.877 --> 26:06.367
She had me
running to the pharmacy

26:06.445 --> 26:08.777
five times a day
for painkillers.

26:08.881 --> 26:11.406
She ever mention
an Anya Czabo?

26:11.483 --> 26:13.508
Yes. She had me
track her down.

26:13.585 --> 26:14.882
Track her down how?

26:14.953 --> 26:19.822
She gave me a copy of a note, just the
top part, with some city union logo.

26:19.925 --> 26:23.053
She told me to find somebody
named Anya who worked there.

26:23.128 --> 26:27.030
Well, actually, what she
screamed was, "Just do it, moron!"

26:27.532 --> 26:28.897
Oh!

26:29.601 --> 26:33.264
The next day,
Wednesday, she fired me.

26:33.338 --> 26:37.240
And Thursday, Walter was reading
the note and blowing a gasket.

26:39.578 --> 26:42.445
He was probably seeing
Anya and Janice Steiner

26:42.514 --> 26:44.379
at the apartment
on alternating days.

26:44.449 --> 26:47.077
Now, Janice,
she found the note.

26:47.152 --> 26:52.988
She sent it to Walter, to maybe
force Anya to break up with Frank.

26:53.992 --> 26:56.256
She ended up making more trouble
for Frank than she bargained for.

26:56.328 --> 26:58.592
I wish my dad had Frank's
retirement package.

26:58.664 --> 27:02.623
Frank still has clearance
to access NYPD records.

27:02.701 --> 27:04.293
Departmental courtesy.

27:04.369 --> 27:06.360
Week ago Wednesday,
2:12 p. m.,

27:06.438 --> 27:08.736
says here he accessed
Walter's records

27:08.807 --> 27:11.037
showing his
spousal abuse beefs.

27:11.944 --> 27:14.879
Wednesday afternoon, Frank was
in D.C. At a Senate hearing.

27:16.748 --> 27:20.206
Janice, she looked up
Walter's sheet.

27:20.285 --> 27:22.583
She found out Anya was
married to a wife-beater,

27:22.654 --> 27:25.589
and sent him
his wife's love note.

27:25.657 --> 27:26.954
That's hardball.

27:27.025 --> 27:29.721
Not to mention
dangerous and stupid.

27:30.062 --> 27:32.292
Well, this woman's
not stupid.

27:33.532 --> 27:36.194
If she provoked Walter
into beating Anya,

27:37.669 --> 27:40.968
she knew that Frank would
do something about it.

27:41.039 --> 27:42.836
A crisis, you know?

27:44.576 --> 27:47.067
Manipulators,
they love a crisis.

27:47.145 --> 27:50.444
That's where
they do their best work.

27:53.785 --> 27:56.777
Oh, God,
you're too much!

27:59.124 --> 28:00.489
Don't stop.

28:01.994 --> 28:04.326
Janice. Oh, Janice, baby.

28:06.198 --> 28:07.222
I said, don't stop.

28:07.299 --> 28:09.733
It's her.
She knows we're here.

28:10.335 --> 28:11.461
Hey.

28:12.237 --> 28:14.330
She can't give you what I can
give you. You know that, don't you?

28:14.406 --> 28:17.102
Oh, God, yes. Yes.

28:18.377 --> 28:19.435
Yes.

28:23.448 --> 28:24.813
<i>Hello?</i>

28:36.161 --> 28:39.255
Frank Adair is the cop who took
our city back from the outlaws.

28:39.331 --> 28:41.629
He's a dedicated
career crime-fighter.

28:41.700 --> 28:44.100
And a dedicated
three-timing bastard.

28:45.137 --> 28:48.004
I don't know what Frank's
capable of anymore.

28:48.073 --> 28:49.836
Maybe they're right.

28:50.409 --> 28:52.877
Maybe this Steiner woman
played him.

28:52.944 --> 28:56.505
She provoked him to murder,
and then helped him cover it up?

28:56.581 --> 29:00.381
Her assistant said Janice stockpiled
painkillers when she had sinus surgery.

29:00.452 --> 29:03.353
That's probably where the drugs
in Walter's trunk came from.

29:03.422 --> 29:07.256
Mr. Czabo's wife,
she's in hiding?

29:07.325 --> 29:08.815
Or worse.

29:10.328 --> 29:16.164
This idea that Frank Adair could
be manipulated by this P.R. Person.

29:16.234 --> 29:17.997
Maybe she found
a way into him?

29:18.070 --> 29:19.264
Speculation.

29:19.337 --> 29:23.000
How lonely it seems without
evidence by its side.

29:23.408 --> 29:27.105
Well, there's evidence that
there was a security breach.

29:27.179 --> 29:29.409
Someone stole
Frank's access code

29:29.481 --> 29:31.813
to take a look
at Walter's sheet.

29:33.618 --> 29:36.178
That merits
a visit to Frank's house.

29:38.056 --> 29:42.083
A security breach? Usually
that's when people call Frank.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.219
It's the barber's kid who
always needs a haircut.

29:44.296 --> 29:48.596
The breach happened sometime
before Easter weekend.

29:49.734 --> 29:52.202
He was in D.C. On Wednesday,
and in his office on Thursday.

29:52.270 --> 29:53.760
Thursday night's
a blank.

29:53.839 --> 29:57.832
He was getting his portrait
done for his campaign poster.

29:57.909 --> 29:58.933
How did it turn out?

29:59.010 --> 30:01.501
Well, it's not exactly
the Frank I know.

30:06.618 --> 30:08.210
That's nice.

30:11.823 --> 30:13.381
This smiley face,

30:13.458 --> 30:16.916
is that the idea of the same
person who suggested these?

30:17.496 --> 30:20.727
That Janice Steiner.
We met her.

30:20.799 --> 30:23.529
She believes that Frank
has a big future, you know.

30:23.602 --> 30:26.571
He trusts her. He puts
himself in her hands.

30:26.638 --> 30:28.868
It must be tough
sharing Frank with her.

30:29.608 --> 30:31.735
Well, she's pushy.

30:32.978 --> 30:35.503
But everything's been fine
since I pushed back.

30:35.580 --> 30:38.413
You two had a run-in?
What happened?

30:38.483 --> 30:42.112
She wanted childhood
pictures of Frank for a book.

30:42.187 --> 30:45.520
And I told her that they were lost
in a fire when Frank was young.

30:45.590 --> 30:48.388
And then two months ago she
was here working with Frank,

30:48.460 --> 30:51.657
and I caught her looking
through my photo album.

30:52.697 --> 30:55.495
I let her know she was not
welcome here after that.

30:55.567 --> 30:59.230
I didn't see any
pictures with his family

30:59.304 --> 31:01.499
when he graduated
from the academy.

31:01.573 --> 31:04.440
Frank was estranged
from his father.

31:04.509 --> 31:08.138
And his mother died in an accident
in Baltimore when Frank was nine.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.508
Mom?

31:09.581 --> 31:11.412
Oh, that's the kids.
Excuse me.

31:15.187 --> 31:16.814
He ever talk to you
about his childhood?

31:17.522 --> 31:19.183
He never brought it up.

31:20.025 --> 31:24.826
Janice was interested. Maybe it
didn't stop with the photo albums.

31:28.967 --> 31:30.662
Nine-year-old Frankie
comes home from school,

31:30.735 --> 31:33.533
finds his mother in the kitchen
beaten to a pulp with a hammer.

31:33.605 --> 31:34.902
Who did it?
The old man?

31:34.973 --> 31:36.634
No,
he was alibied in Chicago.

31:37.609 --> 31:38.940
These suspects,
all boyfriends?

31:39.077 --> 31:40.408
If you want.

31:40.478 --> 31:42.105
Mostly junkies
and dope dealers.

31:42.180 --> 31:43.841
Mrs. Adair's
social circle.

31:44.716 --> 31:46.308
This is her sad story.

31:47.252 --> 31:48.879
Couple of dozen
dope beefs,

31:48.954 --> 31:51.184
and everything else she had
to do to support her habit.

31:51.256 --> 31:52.848
That's the world
her son grew up in.

31:52.924 --> 31:56.860
A lot of material here. You put this
together since we called yesterday?

31:56.928 --> 31:58.623
We got a request
five years ago

31:58.697 --> 32:00.892
from the Commissioner's office
to reopen the case

32:00.966 --> 32:02.831
as a courtesy
to Mr. Adair.

32:02.901 --> 32:04.368
How about the last
couple of months,

32:04.436 --> 32:05.869
anyone try to get
this information,

32:05.937 --> 32:07.928
maybe someone that
worked for Frank Adair?

32:08.006 --> 32:10.634
Yeah, matter of fact,
someone did.

32:12.210 --> 32:13.939
So, she had
the Baltimore P.D.

32:14.012 --> 32:16.537
Fax the murder report
to her office.

32:16.748 --> 32:19.740
It gave Janice
a hot button to push.

32:19.818 --> 32:24.619
She could've anticipated that
he'd snap when Anya got beaten.

32:25.824 --> 32:28.088
Frank Adair's a rock.

32:28.159 --> 32:30.389
First man through a door,
never lost his cool.

32:30.462 --> 32:31.520
The lab confirms

32:31.596 --> 32:35.396
Walter's rap sheet wasn't accessed
from Frank's home computer.

32:36.401 --> 32:39.234
Is Frank into
sport fishing?

32:39.304 --> 32:41.704
He wears $600 shoes, I don't
think he likes to get them wet.

32:41.773 --> 32:43.502
Because the Saturday
Anya disappeared,

32:43.575 --> 32:46.544
he checked the tide tables
off of Rockaway Inlet.

32:47.612 --> 32:49.079
His old beat.

32:49.147 --> 32:51.445
When he first
came out of the academy,

32:51.516 --> 32:54.508
Frank didn't have any hooks,
so he ended up in Coney Island.

32:54.586 --> 32:57.146
A lot of deep, murky waters
off of those docks?

32:58.556 --> 33:00.183
Frank would know.

33:05.397 --> 33:07.729
This was Frank's beat when
they found a Cadillac right here

33:07.799 --> 33:09.960
with two Mob guys
in the trunk.

33:10.035 --> 33:13.232
Car had been there 12 years.
Complete fluke they found it.

33:13.338 --> 33:14.965
Frank remembered.

33:16.474 --> 33:19.272
There's no trauma,
no sign of strangling.

33:26.217 --> 33:27.309
Pulmonary edema.

33:27.385 --> 33:30.616
She drowned. She was
alive when she went in.

33:30.689 --> 33:33.351
She could've done this
to herself, a suicide.

33:34.426 --> 33:36.917
No. It's Frank.

33:36.995 --> 33:40.726
And Janice Steiner. Frank
was probably in Anya's car.

33:40.799 --> 33:41.857
Janice followed.

33:41.933 --> 33:44.424
He killed the man
who beat Mrs. Czabo.

33:44.502 --> 33:47.471
Now you say he killed the very
woman he wanted to protect?

33:47.539 --> 33:49.871
Well, he's at war
with himself.

33:51.242 --> 33:53.710
With Janice egging him on.

33:53.778 --> 33:56.178
We got to turn
these two on each other.

33:56.247 --> 33:58.875
We split them.
We make him choose.

33:58.950 --> 34:01.578
Janice got rid
of one rival.

34:01.653 --> 34:04.520
Her next target
would be Frank's wife.

34:07.092 --> 34:08.320
What if she
tried to convince us

34:08.393 --> 34:11.453
that Marie
was behind Anya's death?

34:11.896 --> 34:13.693
We might believe her.

34:17.936 --> 34:20.563
It came up while we were
looking into a security breach.

34:20.638 --> 34:23.835
We found a cache of files,
some from the NYPD database.

34:23.908 --> 34:25.306
This stuff was
on her computer?

34:25.377 --> 34:28.676
No. It was saved on her Internet
server, under her account.

34:28.746 --> 34:30.681
What was in the files?
Recipes?

34:30.815 --> 34:32.783
It's more serious
than that.

34:34.452 --> 34:39.116
She had Anya's personal info.
Her social, her car registration.

34:40.024 --> 34:42.117
She even had the Liberty
Street apartment address.

34:42.193 --> 34:44.991
She got the information using
your Departmental access code.

34:45.063 --> 34:46.223
Marie had the goods
on you, Frank.

34:46.297 --> 34:48.231
She knew all about
your affair with Anya.

34:50.001 --> 34:53.869
All right, so you have a couple
of security violations here.

34:53.938 --> 34:54.962
You let her go home now,

34:55.039 --> 34:58.008
you have my word we'll show up for
a hearing, pay a fine, whatever.

34:59.444 --> 35:00.706
There's more, Frank.

35:00.779 --> 35:04.306
This is a private matter,
Jimmy, between Marie and me.

35:04.382 --> 35:09.081
She had information from
one of your old cases

35:09.154 --> 35:11.486
when you were a
patrolman in Coney Island.

35:12.257 --> 35:13.918
It was about a car
that sat off a dock

35:13.992 --> 35:16.483
in Sheepshead Bay
for 12 years.

35:17.929 --> 35:19.487
Okay.

35:19.564 --> 35:23.523
Well, we thought it was odd that she
would want that information, so...

35:25.437 --> 35:29.134
We sent a diver off
the dock to have a look.

35:32.310 --> 35:35.541
The tox screen found that she'd
been doped up with barbiturates.

35:35.613 --> 35:40.778
She was strapped in the car and
the car was rolled into the water.

35:41.619 --> 35:44.213
Marie knew that you
were having an affair.

35:44.289 --> 35:46.985
She might have
been worried that,

35:47.058 --> 35:50.994
with her husband dead, Anya would
want to make trouble for you.

35:51.062 --> 35:52.495
Your wife
was protecting you.

35:52.564 --> 35:54.361
You think
Marie did this?

35:54.833 --> 35:56.323
This guy's nuts.

35:56.401 --> 36:00.633
It's not for nothing Marie's
been a cop's wife for 23 years.

36:00.705 --> 36:02.832
She knows people who
can get things done.

36:02.907 --> 36:06.468
You're both nuts. Marie
had nothing to do with this.

36:06.544 --> 36:08.478
I want to talk to her.

36:08.546 --> 36:11.208
She's suspected of killing your
mistress. You can't go in there.

36:11.282 --> 36:12.408
You know better.
So do you.

36:12.484 --> 36:14.111
For God's sake,
she's a school librarian.

36:14.185 --> 36:17.814
Who loves you very much, who
stuck by you all these years.

36:17.889 --> 36:22.019
Marie just wouldn't stand by and
let some chippy destroy her man.

36:26.297 --> 36:28.128
Can you at least
tell her that I'm here,

36:28.266 --> 36:30.131
and I got a lawyer
on the way?

36:32.070 --> 36:33.833
Yeah, I can do that.

36:38.676 --> 36:40.268
Frank sent word
he'll be done soon.

36:40.845 --> 36:42.005
I'm sorry you
have to wait here.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.344
I'm sorry that he made you
send a car to pick me up.

36:44.415 --> 36:46.542
If he'd called me,
I would've driven myself.

36:46.618 --> 36:49.018
Anything for you,
Marie, you know that.

36:50.088 --> 36:53.057
I don't understand how this
ended up in her account.

36:53.124 --> 36:54.284
It doesn't make sense.

36:54.359 --> 36:55.690
Well, it wasn't
magic, Frank.

36:57.996 --> 36:59.088
I got here
as soon as I could.

36:59.163 --> 37:00.892
They kept me
waiting downstairs.

37:03.535 --> 37:06.527
Marie?
Why is she in there?

37:11.142 --> 37:12.507
Frank, is everything
all right?

37:12.577 --> 37:14.442
Uh, Ms. Steiner,
maybe you should wait...

37:14.512 --> 37:15.843
No, that's okay.

37:18.249 --> 37:20.149
They found Anya Czabo dead.

37:20.218 --> 37:22.982
They think Marie had
something to do with it.

37:23.054 --> 37:25.147
Marie? Why would
they think that?

37:25.223 --> 37:28.386
Well, we found some computer
files in an account under her name.

37:28.459 --> 37:30.893
That's what led us
to discover Mrs. Czabo.

37:31.496 --> 37:33.487
That's horrible.

37:33.898 --> 37:36.765
Why would Marie
want her dead?

37:36.834 --> 37:40.964
To keep her away from Frank. To
defend the fortress of her marriage.

37:41.039 --> 37:42.768
Mmm. But the way
it looks now,

37:42.840 --> 37:46.674
she might not be around for your
silver anniversary, Mr. Adair.

37:48.246 --> 37:50.714
Frank, we have to
stand by her.

37:51.716 --> 37:52.740
I know
some people who...

37:52.817 --> 37:54.250
Janice, don't.

37:54.852 --> 37:55.841
I...

37:57.021 --> 37:59.046
I have to get
out of this room.

38:09.634 --> 38:10.828
She's the mother of
my children, Janice.

38:10.902 --> 38:11.926
Frank, I know.

38:12.003 --> 38:13.402
The mother
of my children.

38:13.538 --> 38:14.971
Frank, you okay?

38:16.507 --> 38:18.304
What, you're leaving?

38:19.010 --> 38:22.138
You're going to leave Marie
here to fend for herself?

38:22.213 --> 38:23.737
Frank, come on.

38:24.549 --> 38:27.643
Frank, come on. It's the
mother of your children.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.089
What, you don't know what to do?

38:39.998 --> 38:41.158
I got to talk to her.

38:41.232 --> 38:44.133
Frank, no. You and I,
we have to talk first.

38:46.304 --> 38:49.205
Yeah, the little
contradictions in life.

38:49.273 --> 38:51.764
They can really drive
you out of your mind.

38:51.843 --> 38:54.004
But that comes
with the territory, right?

38:54.078 --> 38:56.478
I mean, a bigger-than-life
guy like you.

38:56.547 --> 38:59.710
Me, I just got a job,
you know. Just one job.

38:59.784 --> 39:04.312
I get home, I can hardly, you
know... Even if I wanted to, man...

39:04.389 --> 39:05.549
I'm wiped out,
you know?

39:05.623 --> 39:09.491
You, you got the corporation,
you got politics, the family,

39:09.560 --> 39:12.028
you got two mistresses...
Well, you got one mistress.

39:13.564 --> 39:15.725
After what Marie did.

39:17.068 --> 39:20.970
Is that why you have so many cell
phones, one for each compartment?

39:21.839 --> 39:24.774
You, you show
some respect.

39:24.842 --> 39:28.107
You know, this machine
that you call a life,

39:29.113 --> 39:33.482
it holds itself together as long
as you hold yourself together.

39:36.054 --> 39:38.454
Let me throw another
complication at you.

39:38.523 --> 39:41.720
Two days before Walter
was beaten to death,

39:42.994 --> 39:44.325
someone

39:46.230 --> 39:48.960
used your access code
to look at his sheet.

39:49.033 --> 39:51.524
Mmm. Somebody made
Walter as a wife-beater.

39:51.602 --> 39:53.570
And what do you know,
two days later,

39:53.638 --> 39:57.369
somebody sent him that love
note and he went after Anya.

39:59.711 --> 40:01.941
We worked
this through, Frank.

40:02.513 --> 40:04.310
He got the note from Anya.

40:04.382 --> 40:06.373
And she looked at
his rap sheet? Why?

40:06.517 --> 40:08.542
She already knew
he beat on her.

40:08.619 --> 40:09.881
That had to be Marie.

40:09.954 --> 40:13.082
Frank, of course, if she
already knew about Anya...

40:13.157 --> 40:15.216
Stop talking about Marie.

40:15.293 --> 40:17.557
Why? Does that make
you uncomfortable?

40:18.863 --> 40:21.423
I think this is when
all the parts of life

40:22.800 --> 40:24.165
start smashing
against each other.

40:24.235 --> 40:26.100
You know, your pride,

40:27.872 --> 40:29.271
your shame.

40:34.312 --> 40:35.904
Where did you get this? Come
on, you know where we got it.

40:35.980 --> 40:37.413
We got it in Baltimore.

40:37.749 --> 40:40.217
We read the whole file about
your poor junkie mother.

40:40.284 --> 40:42.752
She was beaten to death
by one of her dealers.

40:42.820 --> 40:44.447
You think
she stiffed him?

40:44.689 --> 40:46.589
You, I could take
you down right here...

40:46.657 --> 40:48.750
Hey, look, we're not the only
ones interested in your childhood.

40:48.826 --> 40:51.624
Baltimore P.D. Said
somebody from your office

40:51.696 --> 40:54.494
called them two months ago and
asked for the murder report.

40:54.565 --> 40:58.524
They had it faxed to
this number. Recognize it?

41:02.306 --> 41:05.469
It's my job to know
these things, Frank.

41:05.543 --> 41:07.773
Yeah, it's her job
to know his weaknesses,

41:07.845 --> 41:10.313
it's your job
to know his flash points,

41:10.648 --> 41:14.049
to ride to rescue some
bruised and beaten woman,

41:14.118 --> 41:15.380
to know what he'd do
to Walter.

41:15.453 --> 41:17.751
He didn't do anything
to Walter.

41:18.289 --> 41:21.725
Frank, everything I've done,
it's been in service to you.

41:21.793 --> 41:23.124
I'm loyal to you.

41:23.261 --> 41:24.626
She's loyal, all right.

41:24.695 --> 41:28.062
She didn't get rid of Anya to go from
being number three to being number two.

41:28.132 --> 41:30.032
She's going all the way.

41:32.436 --> 41:33.460
So, now you know, Frank.

41:33.538 --> 41:36.701
Now you know who put the
files in Marie's account.

41:37.308 --> 41:39.071
Now you know who made
the hell you're in.

41:39.143 --> 41:41.907
Why are you trying to do this
to him? He's one of your own.

41:45.983 --> 41:46.972
No!

41:48.152 --> 41:49.813
The scissors.
Let go of me!

41:49.887 --> 41:53.448
Let me go!
That bitch!

41:56.060 --> 41:58.551
You malevolent,
conniving bitch!

41:58.629 --> 42:02.190
Look at you, on the floor,
your mother's son.

42:02.266 --> 42:05.861
He killed Walter Czabo,
beat him with his bare hands.

42:05.937 --> 42:08.201
He threatened me if I
didn't help him cover it up.

42:08.272 --> 42:09.296
Listen to her.

42:09.373 --> 42:12.103
Even now, she spews her
venom into your life,

42:12.176 --> 42:13.734
the life that you
put in her hands, Frank.

42:13.811 --> 42:16.211
She told me to kill Anya.
She told me and told me...

42:16.280 --> 42:17.770
Liar! Liar!

42:17.849 --> 42:20.443
She held the steering wheel
and I pushed the car.

42:20.518 --> 42:22.349
You street filth.

42:23.321 --> 42:25.289
You're under arrest,
Ms. Steiner.

42:25.356 --> 42:28.416
You went too far. The
mother of my children...

42:28.492 --> 42:31.290
I didn't do anything to her.
Don't you get it?

42:31.362 --> 42:35.264
It's your friends here. They
did it, your loyal friends!

42:35.900 --> 42:37.800
Get your hands
off me!

42:39.837 --> 42:41.065
Marie...

42:44.375 --> 42:45.706
Jimmy told me
everything.

42:45.776 --> 42:47.505
Please, Marie.
I can't lose you.

42:49.847 --> 42:51.212
Jimmy...

42:51.282 --> 42:53.273
Jimmy, don't I got
any friends here?

42:54.418 --> 42:56.352
Save it, Frank.

43:04.161 --> 43:07.062
There goes the greatest cop I ever knew.
