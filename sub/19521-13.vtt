There are four stages here

02:02.756 --> 02:04.990
Complete a stage,

02:04.992 --> 02:07.559
If you don't,

02:51.705 --> 02:55.007
<i>Half the field runs tonight

02:55.009 --> 02:57.509
For more on that,
let's go down to Kristine Leahy.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.044
- Thanks, Matt.
- Stage one is made up

02:59.046 --> 03:01.914
of eight brutal obstacles,
and in order to advance,

03:01.916 --> 03:05.250
competitors must
complete it in under 2:35.

03:05.252 --> 03:09.321
It all starts with
the agility test of Snake Run.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.323
<i>Then it's a jump
to the Propeller Bar,</i>

03:11.325 --> 03:14.193
<i>where they'll grab the rope
and swing to safety.</i>

03:14.195 --> 03:17.496
<i>Then it's this epic new
obstacle, the Double Dipper.</i>

03:17.498 --> 03:19.531
<i>Athletes slide the bar
down the track,</i>

03:19.533 --> 03:22.301
<i>then release
and catch a second bar.</i>

03:22.303 --> 03:24.703
<i>That leads into
the Jumping Spider.</i>

03:24.705 --> 03:27.206
<i>Competitors have to
jump off the mini tramp,</i>

03:27.208 --> 03:30.742
<i>land in the chute, and work
their way to the other side.</i>

03:30.744 --> 03:34.146
<i>That's followed by another
new obstacle, Parkour Run.</i>

03:34.148 --> 03:37.382
<i>Five angled steps,
then a jump to a rope.</i>

03:37.384 --> 03:39.818
<i>Then it's the Warped Wall,
but here in Vegas</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:43.655
<i>there's a much shorter run-up
than in city competitions.</i>

03:43.657 --> 03:45.791
<i>Balance will be tested
as they run across</i>

03:45.793 --> 03:49.094
<i>another new obstacle,
the Domino Pipes.</i>

03:49.096 --> 03:50.796
<i>Then it's the Flying Squirrel.</i>

03:50.798 --> 03:52.497
<i>With the clock ticking,</i>

03:52.499 --> 03:55.067
<i>athletes will have to swing
through two sets of handles</i>

03:55.069 --> 03:57.469
<i>to the cargo net
and climb to the top.</i>

03:57.471 --> 03:59.671
<i>Hit that buzzer
before the clock runs out,</i>

03:59.673 --> 04:01.440
they're advancing
to stage two.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.008
- Guys.
<i>- Thanks, Kristine.</i>

04:03.010 --> 04:04.977
<i>Well, it's time
to get the finals started,</i>

04:04.979 --> 04:08.013
<i>and hyping this crowd up
is Gabe Hurtado,</i>

04:08.015 --> 04:11.016
<i>the shoe salesman
from Fresno, California.</i>

04:11.018 --> 04:13.518
<i>We told you the story about
Gabe's home burning down,</i>

04:13.520 --> 04:16.521
<i>and "Ninja Warrior" helping
lift his family up.</i>

04:16.523 --> 04:18.824
<i>You can see "Rise"
on his T-shirt,</i>

04:18.826 --> 04:21.093
<i>and he's got on
his trademark bandana.</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:23.228
<i>- Remember, he gave us
some bandanas to wear</i>

04:23.230 --> 04:24.997
<i>back in the LA city finals.</i>

04:24.999 --> 04:26.798
<i>- His girlfriend's
on the sidelines</i>

04:26.800 --> 04:28.934
<i>with his two daughters
and his cousin,</i>

04:28.936 --> 04:32.704
<i>and here on stage one,
there's only 2:35 to finish,</i>

04:32.706 --> 04:34.506
<i>and that clock
will be counting down.</i>

04:36.377 --> 04:38.043
<i>And here we go.</i>

04:38.045 --> 04:41.747
<i>Starting off with this
balance obstacle, Snake Run.</i>

04:41.749 --> 04:43.315
<i>Hurtado through quickly,</i>

04:43.317 --> 04:44.850
<i>heading up
to the Propeller Bar.</i>

04:44.852 --> 04:48.287
<i>- This knocked out more
than any other last year.</i>

04:48.289 --> 04:50.322
<i>- Big jump,
and right to the rope.</i>

04:50.324 --> 04:51.757
<i>What a move.</i>

04:51.759 --> 04:53.892
<i>- That was bold.
- Never seen anyone try that.</i>

04:53.894 --> 04:54.926
<i>- Now he'll give us
our first look</i>

04:54.928 --> 04:56.561
<i>at the Double Dipper.</i>

04:56.563 --> 05:00.065
<i>- This is a roller coaster ride
with over 50 feet of track.</i>

05:00.067 --> 05:01.733
<i>- Has to ride one bar down,</i>

05:01.735 --> 05:04.202
<i>then jump and catch another.</i>

05:04.204 --> 05:06.605
<i>He's got it.
Oh!</i>

05:06.607 --> 05:08.640
<i>Hurtado goes down,</i>

05:08.642 --> 05:12.711
<i>and this obstacle's gonna be
a challenge all night long.</i>

05:12.713 --> 05:14.980
<i>- First let's look
at the Propeller Bar.</i>

05:14.982 --> 05:18.984
<i>He just barely touches the bar
and goes right to the rope.</i>

05:18.986 --> 05:21.920
<i>But on the Double Dipper,
he released the first bar</i>

05:21.922 --> 05:26.391
<i>and grabbed the second
but just couldn't hang on.</i>

05:26.393 --> 05:27.993
- It was a fun ride.
- I love roller coasters,

05:27.995 --> 05:31.029
but this one got me.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.399
<i>- Up next, another
familiar face to "Ninja" fans.</i>

05:34.401 --> 05:37.502
<i>This is Karsten Williams
out of McKinney, Texas.</i>

05:37.504 --> 05:39.638
<i>This is Karsten's
fourth straight year</i>

05:39.640 --> 05:42.307
<i>in the national finals, but
he keeps hitting a roadblock</i>

05:42.309 --> 05:44.209
<i>here on stage one.</i>

05:45.412 --> 05:47.145

I've made it to Vegas stage one

05:47.147 --> 05:49.414

05:49.416 --> 05:52.617
<i>and I've failed

05:52.619 --> 05:54.753

05:56.757 --> 05:58.857
<i>Hold on, hold on.</i>

05:58.859 --> 06:01.827
<i>- Oh, so close.</i>

06:03.764 --> 06:06.498
I started doubting my abilities
and why I'm there.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.900
Why am I doing this
if I keep failing?

06:08.902 --> 06:12.671
<i>- He is the hardest person
on himself.</i>

06:12.673 --> 06:17.008

17:39.359 --> 17:41.192
<i>to get your body weight
around that pipe.</i>

17:41.194 --> 17:42.360
<i>- He doesn't want
to hit the water.</i>

17:42.362 --> 17:43.995
<i>- Got his feet up.
- Ooh!</i>

17:43.997 --> 17:46.464
<i>Matt, he may not have
enough surface.</i>

17:46.466 --> 17:48.900
<i>- Oh, man, look at that.
- Can he get the knees?</i>

17:48.902 --> 17:51.102
<i>What a save!</i>

17:51.104 --> 17:53.171
<i>- Oh-ho-ho!
- An incredible effort.</i>

17:53.173 --> 17:54.705
<i>But now DiGangi's
got to get going.</i>

17:54.707 --> 17:57.675
- You got to go!
- You got to go!

17:57.677 --> 17:59.477
<i>- Less than 30 seconds left,</i>

17:59.479 --> 18:01.446
<i>and he's got
the Flying Squirrel.</i>

18:01.448 --> 18:03.581
<i>And he is looking exhausted</i>

18:03.583 --> 18:04.916
<i>as he has to
swing his way over</i>

18:04.918 --> 18:06.384
<i>to the cargo net.
Got to go.</i>

18:06.386 --> 18:07.919
<i>- Big numbers
in front of his face.</i>

18:07.921 --> 18:11.255
<i>- He's got to go hard.
- One more set of handles.</i>

18:11.257 --> 18:12.957
<i>Oh!</i>

18:12.959 --> 18:15.660
<i>- With the clock ticking,
he comes up short</i>

18:15.662 --> 18:17.361
<i>on the Flying Squirrel.</i>

18:17.363 --> 18:20.465
<i>So close for Chris DiGangi.</i>

18:20.467 --> 18:23.701
<i>- He didn't get his foot on top
of that third domino pipe,</i>

18:23.703 --> 18:25.403
<i>and he tumbles down.</i>

18:25.405 --> 18:28.739
<i>He fought for more than
30 seconds to save himself,</i>

18:28.741 --> 18:31.442
<i>but he used a lot of energy
and time.</i>

18:31.444 --> 18:33.845
<i>He had to rush it
at the Flying Squirrel</i>

18:33.847 --> 18:36.180
<i>and came up short.</i>

18:36.182 --> 18:38.950
- Just couldn't get enough
in the swing.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.119
A lot of fun, though.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.087
<i>- Well, Nick Hanson
missed the buzzer</i>

18:43.089 --> 18:44.989
<i>by two seconds last year.</i>

18:44.991 --> 18:48.726
<i>Now the Eskimo Ninja gets
a second shot at stage one.</i>

18:48.728 --> 18:50.995
<i>We'll see his run
when we come back.</i>

18:50.997 --> 18:54.899
<i>And later, the Cowboy Ninja's
heartbreaking battle.</i>

18:54.901 --> 18:56.934
- She's by far
the toughest person I know.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.436
<i>- Lance Pekus
and his wife Heather</i>

18:58.438 --> 19:01.072
<i>talk about the fight
of their lives</i>

19:01.074 --> 19:04.408
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

19:06.945 --> 19:09.147
<i>- Welcome back to night one
of the national finals</i>

19:09.149 --> 19:10.681
<i>in Las Vegas.</i>

19:10.683 --> 19:12.483
<i>While we were away,
two more athletes</i>

19:12.485 --> 19:14.051
<i>tried to finish the course.</i>

19:14.053 --> 19:17.021
<i>Jesse Lucero was one
of 14 walk-ons</i>

19:17.023 --> 19:18.689
<i>to earn a ticket to Vegas.</i>

19:18.691 --> 19:21.826
<i>- You see Lucero very focused,
dialed in.</i>

19:21.828 --> 19:23.561
- Go, Jesse!

19:23.563 --> 19:26.230
<i>- But tonight he couldn't get
a grip on the Propeller Bar.</i>

19:26.232 --> 19:27.798
<i>Oh!</i>

19:27.800 --> 19:29.400
- That's a bummer.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.336
<i>- Oklahoma's Matt Holt
was ready for his close-up.</i>

19:32.338 --> 19:34.772
<i>- You can't start a run
if you don't do a selfie.</i>

19:34.774 --> 19:37.475
<i>- The 21-year-old rookie
raced all the way</i>

19:37.477 --> 19:38.843
<i>to the Jumping Spider,</i>

19:38.845 --> 19:40.878
<i>where the picture
wasn't so pretty.</i>

19:40.880 --> 19:42.813
<i>- Not even close.</i>

19:44.150 --> 19:45.750
<i>Up next is one
of the smartest</i>

19:45.752 --> 19:48.352
<i>and most talented ninjas
out here.</i>

19:48.354 --> 19:51.455
<i>This is mechanical engineer
Brian Wilczewski.</i>

19:51.457 --> 19:52.957
<i>He's made it
to the national finals</i>

19:52.959 --> 19:54.926
<i>every year he's competed,</i>

19:54.928 --> 19:57.261
<i>but one moment
still haunts him.</i>

19:57.263 --> 19:59.931
<i>Four years ago,
Brian fell on the Timbers,</i>

19:59.933 --> 20:02.567
<i>which was the first obstacle
that year.</i>

20:02.569 --> 20:04.735
<i>He was the only one
to go out there,</i>

20:04.737 --> 20:06.337
<i>and the embarrassing moment</i>

20:06.339 --> 20:08.039
<i>has become sort of
an inside joke</i>

20:08.041 --> 20:10.041
<i>to the Wilczewski family.</i>

20:10.043 --> 20:12.009
<i>In fact, look at his mom
and dad on the left there.</i>

20:12.011 --> 20:15.580
<i>Their shirts say "No one falls
on Grip or Timbers."</i>

20:15.582 --> 20:18.149
<i>They'll be watching along with
Brian's brother Chris,</i>

20:18.151 --> 20:21.352
<i>another top ninja
and friend Michelle Warnky.</i>

20:21.354 --> 20:24.855
<i>- Well, Brian looked real good
in LA qualifying and finals.</i>

20:24.857 --> 20:26.591
<i>He's been to stage two before.</i>

20:29.562 --> 20:31.529
<i>- Oh!
- What?</i>

20:31.531 --> 20:33.130
- Oh, no.

20:33.132 --> 20:36.634
<i>- How did he miss that?
- His entire family in shock.</i>

20:36.636 --> 20:38.769
<i>Talk about déjà vu.</i>

20:38.771 --> 20:42.373
<i>And Brian Wilczewski's run
is over before it began.</i>

20:42.375 --> 20:45.810
<i>- Every competitor tonight
has used the first pad here,</i>

20:45.812 --> 20:49.213
<i>but Wilczewski makes a big leap
to the second pad,</i>

20:49.215 --> 20:51.115
<i>and his foot slips right off,</i>

20:51.117 --> 20:54.085
<i>and he's out on the first
obstacle once again.</i>

20:56.155 --> 20:57.655
- I fell.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.625
<i>- Well, hopefully
that shocking exit</i>

21:00.627 --> 21:02.927
<i>doesn't rattle
our next competitor,</i>

21:02.929 --> 21:05.863

21:12.472 --> 21:15.039

24:53.659 --> 24:56.193
<i>- Now finally ready

24:56.195 --> 24:57.995
<i>A stumble,

24:57.997 --> 24:59.396
<i>43 seconds left.</i>

24:59.398 --> 25:01.031
<i>He's ahead of where he was
last season</i>

<i>but got hung up

25:03.169 --> 25:04.568
<i>- on the Flying Squirrel.
- Well, and I think it was</i>

25:04.570 --> 25:06.237
<i>for him... last time
for Nick Hanson,</i>

25:06.239 --> 25:08.272
<i>it was about really
getting that big up,</i>

25:08.274 --> 25:09.974
<i>so he can make that transfer.</i>

25:09.976 --> 25:11.442
<i>- Another swing.</i>

25:11.444 --> 25:13.077
<i>- Come on, you've got
to get comfortable.</i>

25:13.079 --> 25:15.980
<i>- This has to be a bit
of déjà vu for Nick Hanson.</i>

25:15.982 --> 25:17.548
<i>Building up the momentum.</i>

25:17.550 --> 25:20.284
<i>You want to see him
get high on that cargo net.</i>

25:20.286 --> 25:24.121

25:24.123 --> 25:26.924
<i>- Oh, hung in the middle.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.793

You're too close.</i>

25:29.795 --> 25:31.662
<i>Ten seconds.
No, not again.</i>

25:31.664 --> 25:33.898

25:37.236 --> 25:39.670

25:39.672 --> 25:43.340
<i>Oh, my, just a few seconds
faster than last year</i>

25:43.342 --> 25:45.543
<i>but that's all he needed,</i>

25:45.545 --> 25:48.445
<i>and he's our first
finisher tonight.</i>

25:48.447 --> 25:52.416
<i>Nick Hanson's moving on

25:52.418 --> 25:54.451

25:54.453 --> 25:56.186
<i>but made the adjustment,</i>

25:56.188 --> 25:58.622
<i>and then he stumbled
on the Warped Wall,</i>

25:58.624 --> 26:01.191
<i>but Nick Hanson
just kept trucking</i>

26:01.193 --> 26:04.261
<i>and just barely made it
to the buzzer.</i>

26:04.263 --> 26:06.030

last season's early exit.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.100
He's standing by with Kristine.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.535

26:11.537 --> 26:14.104
You did it with
five seconds to spare.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.507
We were all nervous.
Were you nervous?

26:16.509 --> 26:19.376
- Oh, man, when I heard the horn
start going off, I was like,

26:19.378 --> 26:21.946
"Not this year.
It's not gonna happen."

26:21.948 --> 26:23.881
<i>So I climbed up that rope
as quickly as I could</i>

26:23.883 --> 26:25.316
<i>and slammed that buzzer.</i>

26:25.318 --> 26:28.686

to see Nick do this?

26:28.688 --> 26:30.821
- Oh, man, I'm so proud of him.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.189
<i>He's worked so hard for it,</i>

26:32.191 --> 26:34.658
and to see him accomplish
something like that

26:34.660 --> 26:36.427
is just the best.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.995
- Nick, what does it mean to you
to hear your mom

26:37.997 --> 26:39.964
saying those things?

26:39.966 --> 26:41.065
- There's no words.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.499
There's no words for my mom.

26:42.501 --> 26:43.500
I mean, she's pushed me
every time.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.135
She's here every year.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.670
- Well, we're gonna need her
in stage two.

26:46.672 --> 26:49.406
- Can you be there?
- Definitely, most definitely.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.941
- All right,
congratulations, guys.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.543
We'll see you then.

26:52.545 --> 26:55.379
- Thank you so much.
- Matt and Akbar, back to you.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.782
<i>- Coming up, he knows how
to conquer this course.</i>

26:58.784 --> 27:02.686
<i>The fastest time in "American
Ninja Warrior" history.</i>

27:02.688 --> 27:06.690
<i>The Weatherman, Joe Moravsky,
has never failed on stage one,</i>

27:06.692 --> 27:09.193
<i>He'll try to keep
his streak alive.</i>

27:09.195 --> 27:11.629
- You know what the forecast is.
- I'm gonna hit the buzzer.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.598
<i>- Plus, she's a pint-sized
powerhouse.</i>

27:14.600 --> 27:16.634
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

27:16.636 --> 27:19.303
<i>And Barclay Stockett's
ready to break big</i>

27:19.305 --> 27:22.006
<i>in her first trip
to the national finals.</i>

27:22.008 --> 27:23.674
- I'm gonna be Barclay strong.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.076
<i>- We'll see her run
when we come back</i>

27:26.078 --> 27:28.278
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

27:33.652 --> 27:36.086
<i>- Welcome back to Las Vegas

27:36.088 --> 27:37.988
<i>of the national finals.</i>

27:37.990 --> 27:40.090

<i>in the field tonight.</i>

27:51.237 --> 27:53.003
<i>This is New Jersey auctioneer</i>

27:53.005 --> 27:56.040
<i>Judas Licciardello
pulling out a phone?</i>

27:56.042 --> 27:57.875
<i>- "Yeah, I'm in Las Vegas.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.610
<i>Watch this."</i>

27:59.612 --> 28:02.212
<i>- Well, he can definitely yak
it up, and that's a quality</i>

28:02.214 --> 28:04.381
<i>that comes in handy
with his unique occupation.</i>

28:06.352 --> 28:08.385
<i>- Welcome to S&S Auction.
- Thank you all for coming out.</i>

28:08.387 --> 28:09.753
<i>All right, nice set
of Pembrokes here.</i>

28:09.755 --> 28:11.588
<i>How much?
Want to give 200 apiece?</i>

28:11.590 --> 28:13.023
200. I got 200.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.728
<i>I work at a large
auction house.</i>

28:17.730 --> 28:19.930
My grandfather and my father
are both auctioneers,

28:19.932 --> 28:22.533
so that's what led me to become
a third-generation auctioneer.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.578
<i>- Being an auctioneer
is a lot more</i>

28:34.580 --> 28:36.180
<i>than just rifling
through numbers.</i>

28:36.182 --> 28:38.315
You got to have a knowledge
of what you're selling.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.150
All right, nice
marble top set here.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.419
My job is to sell items

28:48.294 --> 28:50.360
<i>One of the things
I like about "Ninja Warrior,"</i>

28:50.362 --> 28:52.596
it's neat to be up there
and be the center of attention.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.864
<i>- Oh, I see you.</i>

28:53.866 --> 28:54.998

just being able

28:55.000 --> 28:56.600
to complete an obstacle

28:56.602 --> 28:58.335
but how you can do it
differently,

28:58.337 --> 28:59.770
<i>how you can make it harder.</i>

28:59.772 --> 29:01.472
<i>- Oh!
- A backflip.</i>

29:01.474 --> 29:03.140
<i>That was special.</i>

29:03.142 --> 29:05.576
<i>- I enjoy doing flips
and having fun.</i>

29:05.578 --> 29:07.711
<i>I'll try to throw something
like that in the course again</i>

29:07.713 --> 29:08.846

29:20.259 --> 29:23.227

29:26.565 --> 29:28.966
<i>Ooh, makes the same
leap Wilczewski attempted</i>

29:28.968 --> 29:30.768
<i>but he survives.</i>

29:30.770 --> 29:32.136
<i>- That was risky.</i>

29:32.138 --> 29:34.138
<i>- Going right into
the Propeller Bar.</i>

29:34.140 --> 29:36.640
<i>- So remember, he's got
that iPhone 7 in his pocket.</i>

29:36.642 --> 29:38.242
<i>I'm not quite sure
if it's waterproof.</i>

29:38.244 --> 29:41.011
<i>- Look at this.
- This guy is really moving</i>

29:41.013 --> 29:42.412
<i>but seems a little confused</i>

29:42.414 --> 29:44.915
<i>as to how to grip the bar.</i>

29:44.917 --> 29:46.917
<i>- Yeah, he's going real hard.</i>

29:46.919 --> 29:48.619
<i>Now push this thing fast
and catch it.</i>

29:48.621 --> 29:50.287
<i>Nice transition. Good.</i>

29:50.289 --> 29:52.589
<i>He is not getting his... whoa!</i>

29:52.591 --> 29:55.025
- What was that?
- Oh, shoot, did you see that?

29:55.027 --> 29:57.861
<i>- The auctioneer did a flip
on the dismount.</i>

29:57.863 --> 29:59.830
<i>How gutsy is that?</i>

29:59.832 --> 30:02.032
<i>- No, are you kidding me?</i>

30:03.569 --> 30:07.137
- One of the greatest moves
we've ever seen on a dismount

30:07.139 --> 30:11.275
<i>followed by a fall
on the very next obstacle.</i>

30:11.277 --> 30:13.443
<i>- I've got to see
this one again.</i>

30:13.445 --> 30:15.078
<i>Coming off the Double Dipper,</i>

30:15.080 --> 30:19.216
<i>he brings the feet up
and over and pulls it off,</i>

30:19.218 --> 30:21.285
<i>and then on the Jumping Spider,</i>

30:21.287 --> 30:23.453
<i>he got his hands out
in front of his feet,</i>

30:23.455 --> 30:25.122
<i>and he couldn't get locked in,</i>

30:25.124 --> 30:26.657
<i>and you remember that iPhone
in his pocket?</i>

30:26.659 --> 30:28.192
<i>Oh, yeah, it got wet.</i>

30:28.194 --> 30:30.894
- I thought I had that one
in the bag all day.

30:32.565 --> 30:34.064
<i>- Well, up next,
one of the real</i>

30:34.066 --> 30:36.200
<i>breakout stars
from this season.</i>

30:36.202 --> 30:40.204
<i>This is 5-foot-tall Barclay
Stockett from Dayton, Texas.</i>

30:40.206 --> 30:43.307
<i>We told you her story
during the San Antonio finals.</i>

30:43.309 --> 30:46.810
<i>She tried ninja training
after watching Kacy Catanzaro,</i>

30:46.812 --> 30:49.513
<i>and with Kacy on the sidelines,
Barclay gave us</i>

30:49.515 --> 30:52.249
<i>one of the most memorable runs
of the season.</i>

30:54.920 --> 30:58.021
- The San Antonio city finals
was a lot more emotional

30:58.023 --> 31:00.457
than I expected it to be.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.826
<i>When I was standing there,
looking at the Warped Wall,</i>

31:02.828 --> 31:06.029
<i>I looked over, and I saw Kacy
jump over the fence.</i>

31:06.031 --> 31:07.998
- Come on, Barclay!
- You got this.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.900
- You got this, Barclay.
- Let's see it.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.668
<i>- It just immediately
brought me back</i>

31:11.670 --> 31:14.504
<i>to watching her get up the
Warped Wall for the first time,</i>

31:14.506 --> 31:16.740
and I was like, "Oh, my God,
like, Kacy's here.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.842
I have to make it up this wall."

31:21.413 --> 31:23.513
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!

31:23.515 --> 31:25.048
<i>Yes!</i>

31:25.050 --> 31:27.217
<i>- Oh, my God, I just caught
the Warped Wall.</i>

31:27.219 --> 31:32.322
<i>- What a moment, the crowd
losing their minds.</i>

31:33.392 --> 31:34.925
- It's almost like,
you know,

31:34.927 --> 31:36.793
passing on that legacy
a little bit,

31:36.795 --> 31:40.030
and it was really, really
special to be a part of it.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.598
- Hey, guys, I'm going to Vegas.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.735
<i>- That's right, she said it.
- I'm going to Vegas.</i>

31:44.737 --> 31:46.536

31:46.538 --> 31:48.538
<i>- My favorite thing
that happened</i>

31:48.540 --> 31:50.240
<i>was after I fell in the water,</i>

31:50.242 --> 31:53.076
<i>and I kind of flopped
like a fish over the side,</i>

31:53.078 --> 31:56.013
<i>and everybody just jumped
on top of me.</i>

31:56.015 --> 31:58.315
It felt like a movie.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.650
<i>I've been waiting
so long for this,</i>

<i>Now I just have to prove it.</i>

32:11.830 --> 32:14.231

32:26.111 --> 32:30.247
<i>- Barclay Stockett
just 5 feet, 112 pounds.</i>

32:30.249 --> 32:32.249
<i>- Oh, Matt,
she is a firecracker.</i>

32:32.251 --> 32:34.985
<i>- One of the strongest women
out here.</i>

32:34.987 --> 32:38.021
<i>Cautious approach.</i>

32:38.023 --> 32:40.257
<i>- Yeah, not exploding through
Snake Run, though,</i>

32:40.259 --> 32:43.026
<i>and I think she's just trying
to work through the nerves.</i>

32:43.028 --> 32:44.761
<i>- The Propeller Bar a real
challenge for the women,</i>

32:44.763 --> 32:46.263
<i>especially the smaller ones.</i>

32:46.265 --> 32:49.399
<i>- Oh, did you see
that hang time? Ooh.</i>

32:49.401 --> 32:51.702

used to be a roadblock</i>

32:51.704 --> 32:54.972

33:01.780 --> 33:03.714
<i>- Only the second woman

33:03.716 --> 33:05.048
<i>- Don't be surprised
if the force counters you</i>

33:05.050 --> 33:06.350
<i>- a little sideways.
- Uh-oh.</i>

33:06.352 --> 33:08.118
<i>- Go, go. Yes.
- Great recovery.</i>

33:08.120 --> 33:11.288
<i>The first woman
through the Double Dipper.</i>

33:12.958 --> 33:14.658
<i>But watch this.</i>

33:14.660 --> 33:16.793
<i>No one this size has gotten
through the Jumping Spider.</i>

33:16.795 --> 33:18.795
<i>- All right, Jumping Spider,
she's got to get in there deep.</i>

33:18.797 --> 33:20.364
<i>Ooh.</i>

33:20.366 --> 33:22.799
<i>- Only two other women

33:22.801 --> 33:25.969
<i>Meagan Martin and Jessie Graff.</i>

33:25.971 --> 33:28.538
<i>Barclay trying to join

<i>- Oh, she's ready

33:33.712 --> 33:37.014
<i>- Jessie Graff's the only woman

33:37.016 --> 33:39.016
<i>Stockett trying
to be the second.</i>

33:39.018 --> 33:40.817
<i>- She's really got
to stretch it out, Matt.</i>

33:40.819 --> 33:43.387
<i>The distance here on Parkour
Run will challenge her.</i>

33:43.389 --> 33:44.721
<i>- Ooh, ooh. Tremendous save.</i>

33:44.723 --> 33:47.124
<i>- She took one
straight to the kneecap.</i>

33:47.126 --> 33:48.425
<i>- What grip strength,</i>

33:48.427 --> 33:50.927
<i>what upper-body strength
out of Stockett,</i>

33:50.929 --> 33:53.130
<i>but now that clock
becomes an issue.</i>

33:53.132 --> 33:54.765
<i>- I hope she's aware
of the time.</i>

33:54.767 --> 33:56.366
<i>- Just over a minute left,</i>

33:56.368 --> 33:59.669
<i>and she has three more
obstacles after this one.</i>

34:02.908 --> 34:04.074
<i>- Get it. Got it.
- Got that foot.</i>

34:04.076 --> 34:06.109
<i>Under a minute.
Got to go.</i>

34:06.111 --> 34:08.145
<i>- Go, Barclay.</i>

34:08.147 --> 34:10.047
<i>- And Stockett,
at just 5 feet tall,</i>

34:10.049 --> 34:12.516
<i>staring down
the Warped Wall.</i>

34:12.518 --> 34:16.652
<i>Oh, and she's kneeling down.
She may just be out of breath.</i>

34:16.655 --> 34:18.588
<i>- She's either catching
her breath or saying a prayer.</i>

34:18.590 --> 34:20.389
<i>Either one works here.</i>

34:20.391 --> 34:23.827
<i>- Well, she's got about
40 seconds for three obstacles.</i>

34:23.829 --> 34:25.962
<i>It is gonna take
a superhuman effort</i>

34:25.964 --> 34:27.964
<i>out of

34:27.966 --> 34:29.498
<i>- Move, you firecracker!</i>

34:29.501 --> 34:32.069
<i>- Oh, comes up just short.</i>

34:32.071 --> 34:34.071
<i>At this point, she may not
be able to finish,</i>

34:34.072 --> 34:36.907
<i>but she could become
just the second woman ever</i>

34:36.909 --> 34:38.942
<i>to get past the Warped Wall
on stage one,</i>

34:38.944 --> 34:41.244
<i>and that would be
a huge accomplishment.</i>

34:41.246 --> 34:42.946
- Dig deep, Barclay!

34:42.947 --> 34:44.181
<i>- Well, Matt,
there's a lot going on.</i>

34:44.183 --> 34:45.748
<i>There's the adrenaline
pumping,</i>

34:45.751 --> 34:47.784
<i>there's the thousands
of people cheering you on,</i>

34:47.786 --> 34:49.252
<i>and then there's
the time element.</i>

34:49.254 --> 34:50.554
<i>- And she's done it!</i>

34:50.556 --> 34:53.023
<i>The second-best run ever
by a woman.</i>

34:53.025 --> 34:54.757
<i>- Ten seconds left, Matt.</i>

34:54.760 --> 34:57.627
<i>- Oh, my, what could have been.</i>

34:57.629 --> 34:59.563
<i>- Go, go, go, go, go, go.</i>

34:59.565 --> 35:03.100
<i>- And she got through it.
- One obstacle left.</i>

35:03.102 --> 35:06.503
<i>What an amazing run
out of Barclay Stockett,</i>

35:06.505 --> 35:07.938
<i>just ran out of time.</i>

35:07.940 --> 35:09.473
<i>- Matt, she didn't hit
the buzzer,</i>

35:09.475 --> 35:11.141
<i>but that still was
a winner run</i>

35:13.045 --> 35:14.845
<i>I mean, look at this crowd.</i>

35:19.718 --> 35:21.685
<i>Just look at her
fly through the air</i>

35:21.687 --> 35:24.821
<i>and get such elevation
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

35:24.823 --> 35:27.991
<i>She also got full extension
in the Jumping Spider,</i>

35:27.993 --> 35:30.961
<i>and remember,
she's only 5 feet tall,</i>

35:30.963 --> 35:34.197
<i>yet she still managed
to make it up the Warped Wall</i>

35:34.199 --> 35:36.800
<i>and go further than any woman
on stage one</i>

35:36.802 --> 35:38.768
<i>besides Jessie Graff.</i>

35:38.770 --> 35:42.606
- I'm pretty proud of myself.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.108
<i>- Well, Barclay Stockett's
only 22.</i>

35:45.110 --> 35:47.577
<i>Travis Rosen's 42.</i>

35:47.579 --> 35:50.747
<i>Can the ageless wonder
conquer stage one once again?</i>

35:50.749 --> 35:52.349
<i>He's up next.</i>

35:52.351 --> 35:55.519
<i>In earlier runs tonight,
for the second straight year,</i>

35:55.521 --> 35:58.622
<i>New Jersey's Anthony DeFranco
saw his season end</i>

35:58.624 --> 36:00.023
<i>on the Jumping Spider.</i>

36:00.025 --> 36:02.893
<i>- Oh, no.
- Not again! Not again.</i>

36:02.895 --> 36:06.263
<i>- New Jersey EMT
Yancey Quezada</i>

36:06.265 --> 36:08.632
<i>saw his night end
at the Double Dipper .</i>

36:08.634 --> 36:10.567
<i>- Ooh, no.</i>

36:10.569 --> 36:12.269
<i>- While Hawaii's Kapu Gaison</i>

36:12.271 --> 36:14.304
<i>made some waves on his way out.</i>

36:14.306 --> 36:17.407
<i>- Ooh, big up
and a big splash.</i>

36:17.409 --> 36:18.708
<i>- But there's a lot more
to come</i>

36:18.710 --> 36:21.244
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

36:23.814 --> 36:25.415
<i>- Welcome back
to the national finals</i>

36:25.417 --> 36:27.717
<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

36:27.719 --> 36:29.753
<i>Our coverage tonight
is powered in part</i>

36:29.755 --> 36:32.589
<i>by crazy healthy
POM Wonderful.</i>

36:32.591 --> 36:34.758
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes</i>

36:34.760 --> 36:37.294
<i>tried to conquer
this stage one course.</i>

36:37.296 --> 36:40.997
<i>Last year, Snake Run took down
Brazi Bro Lucas Gomes,</i>

36:40.999 --> 36:42.332
<i>but not tonight.</i>

36:42.334 --> 36:43.600
<i>That's revenge.</i>

36:43.602 --> 36:45.235
<i>But the redemption
was short-lived,</i>

36:45.237 --> 36:47.637
<i>as he went down
one obstacle later.</i>

36:47.639 --> 36:49.039
<i>Oh!</i>

36:49.041 --> 36:50.941
<i>- Boy, he just did a flip.</i>

36:50.943 --> 36:54.177
<i>- One of the top two women
from the Daytona city finals,</i>

36:54.179 --> 36:57.214
<i>Lindsay Eskildsen,
did get past the Propeller Bar.</i>

36:57.216 --> 36:59.149
<i>- Boom, just like that.</i>
- Good job, good job.

36:59.151 --> 37:01.051
<i>- But the 5'2" web developer</i>

37:01.053 --> 37:02.786
<i>came up short
on the Double Dipper.</i>

37:02.788 --> 37:04.054
<i>- Oh, no.
- Ooh.</i>

37:04.056 --> 37:06.957
<i>Big height
but not enough distance.</i>

37:06.959 --> 37:10.894
<i>- Two-time national finalist
Michael Torres came out fast,</i>

37:10.896 --> 37:11.928
<i>and it nearly cost him.</i>

37:11.930 --> 37:13.363
<i>Oh, no.</i>

37:13.365 --> 37:14.764
<i>- Don't let that speed
kill you, though.</i>

37:14.766 --> 37:16.266
Let's go, Mike.
Let's go, Mike.

37:16.268 --> 37:19.135
<i>- The carpenter from New Jersey
kept up the torrid pace</i>

37:19.137 --> 37:22.205
<i>until his footwork failed him
inside the Jumping Spider.</i>

37:22.207 --> 37:23.573
<i>- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

37:23.575 --> 37:26.810
<i>- Speed kills.</i>

37:26.812 --> 37:29.613
<i>Up next, one of our
oldest competitors here</i>

37:29.615 --> 37:30.947
<i>at the national finals,</i>

37:30.949 --> 37:32.983
<i>but he's also one of the best.</i>

37:32.985 --> 37:35.318
<i>This is 42-year-old
Travis Rosen,</i>

37:35.320 --> 37:37.687
<i>the stock trader
from Franklin, Tennessee.</i>

37:37.689 --> 37:40.423
<i>He is one of the most
consistent ninjas ever,</i>

37:40.425 --> 37:43.994
<i>which is why his run here
last season was such a shock.</i>

37:43.996 --> 37:46.596
<i>He's going for
his sixth straight finish</i>

37:46.598 --> 37:49.199
<i>- on stage... whoa, no!
- Whoa!</i>

37:49.201 --> 37:52.435
<i>- Rosen snakebitten
by the Snake Run.</i>

37:52.437 --> 37:55.438
- In season eight, I fell
on the very first obstacle.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.408
<i>It was the first time
I had fell on stage one.</i>

37:58.410 --> 38:01.544
<i>It was obviously a shock.
It was crushing to me.</i>

38:01.546 --> 38:03.280
<i>I was starting to feel
like retirement</i>

38:03.282 --> 38:05.615
<i>might be right
around the corner.</i>

38:05.617 --> 38:09.452
<i>But that's not how
my legacy is gonna end.</i>

38:09.454 --> 38:11.121
<i>I want to get back
to stage three.</i>

38:11.123 --> 38:14.991
I want to go all the way,
and I want to go to stage four.

38:14.993 --> 38:18.728
<i>♪ ♪</i>

38:18.730 --> 38:20.697
<i>- Well, Rosen flashing
a heart sign</i>

38:20.699 --> 38:22.165
<i>to his wife and three kids,</i>

38:22.167 --> 38:24.367
<i>who made the trip
from Tennessee to cheer him on.</i>

38:24.369 --> 38:26.770
- Come on, Trav!

38:29.808 --> 38:33.076
<i>- And right off the top
has to face Snake Run again.</i>

38:34.079 --> 38:36.713
<i>Little stumble
but he's through.</i>

38:36.715 --> 38:39.816
<i>- That's got to be a huge
weight off his shoulders.</i>

38:39.818 --> 38:41.851
<i>- Quickly up onto
the Propeller Bar.</i>

38:41.853 --> 38:44.654
<i>Rosen, a former gymnast
at the University of Iowa,</i>

38:44.656 --> 38:46.122
<i>swings through easily,</i>

38:46.124 --> 38:48.925
<i>but now the unforgiving
Double Dipper.</i>

38:50.095 --> 38:51.561
- Come on, Trav.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.997
<i>- This is visually
intimidating, so fast.</i>

38:53.999 --> 38:55.465
<i>You got to have the timing,</i>

38:55.467 --> 38:57.100
<i>and you got to trust
yourself in space.</i>

38:57.102 --> 39:00.270
<i>- Oh, yeah, excellent body
control out of the gymnast.</i>

39:00.272 --> 39:02.372
<i>And I like it, pause.
This is a veteran,</i>

39:02.374 --> 39:04.040
<i>regrouping right before
the Jumping Spider.</i>

39:04.042 --> 39:05.408
<i>- Stick it.
- Nails it.</i>

39:05.410 --> 39:07.277
<i>- Nice.
- This is his seventh trip</i>

39:07.279 --> 39:09.112
<i>in a row
to Mount Midoriyama.</i>

39:09.114 --> 39:11.281
<i>- Yeah, and he's made it
past stage one every year</i>

39:11.283 --> 39:12.782
<i>except last season.</i>

39:14.219 --> 39:15.819
<i>- Now taking a look
at the Parkour Run.</i>

39:15.821 --> 39:18.955
<i>Let's see his agility.
Bounding through it.</i>

39:18.957 --> 39:20.824
<i>Ooh, good save.</i>

39:20.826 --> 39:22.659
<i>- Well, he's got plenty
of time left,</i>

39:22.661 --> 39:24.227
<i>but you've got to stick
the landing,</i>

39:24.229 --> 39:26.596
<i>or you could lose
a lot of time.</i>

39:26.598 --> 39:27.597
<i>- He's got it.</i>

39:27.599 --> 39:29.866
- Go, Daddy!

39:29.868 --> 39:31.134
<i>- Now heading
to the Warped Wall.</i>

39:31.136 --> 39:34.037
Beat that wall,
beat that wall.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.574
<i>- Got to get those 42-year-old
legs up this Warped Wall.</i>

39:39.745 --> 39:41.010
<i>- He's got it.</i>

39:43.248 --> 39:46.149
<i>- And well over a minute left
for these final two obstacles,</i>

39:46.151 --> 39:48.351
<i>but he's never faced
either of them,</i>

39:48.353 --> 39:52.689
<i>and we've seen these
Domino Pipes can be tricky.</i>

39:52.691 --> 39:54.190
<i>- Nice, ooh.
- Oh, no!</i>

39:54.192 --> 39:56.192
<i>- Oh, no!
- What a save.</i>

39:56.194 --> 39:58.061
<i>Oh!</i>

39:58.063 --> 39:59.662
<i>You know, if you're gonna
have a stumble,</i>

39:59.664 --> 40:01.297
<i>and you need a great save...</i>

40:01.299 --> 40:02.999
<i>- He took that one straight
to the jaw too.</i>

40:03.001 --> 40:06.202
<i>- What a save, but now
do not miss these laches.</i>

40:06.204 --> 40:07.704
<i>Don't miss these transitions.</i>

40:07.706 --> 40:09.038
<i>- This obstacle right here</i>

40:09.040 --> 40:10.874
<i>is in his wheelhouse
as a gymnast.</i>

40:10.876 --> 40:13.476
<i>- He's got it.
- One transition away now.</i>

40:13.478 --> 40:15.178
<i>- And he's got plenty
of time here.</i>

40:15.180 --> 40:17.981
<i>He can take a couple of extra
swings if he needs them.</i>

40:17.983 --> 40:19.549
<i>- And he's done it.</i>

40:19.551 --> 40:21.651
<i>A little low on the cargo net
but he's got time.</i>

40:21.653 --> 40:23.086
<i>- Plenty of time there,
plenty.</i>

40:23.088 --> 40:25.522
<i>- Well, after
a nightmare run last year,</i>

40:25.524 --> 40:27.690
<i>going out
on the first obstacle,</i>

40:27.692 --> 40:30.527
<i>the ageless wonder's back
where he belongs,</i>

40:30.529 --> 40:32.162
<i>and despite some stumbles,</i>

40:32.164 --> 40:34.998
<i>Travis Rosen's moving on
to stage two.</i>

40:40.605 --> 40:42.772
<i>And for the sixth time
in his career,</i>

40:42.774 --> 40:45.742
<i>he hits the buzzer
on stage one.</i>

40:45.744 --> 40:48.878
<i>- Snake Run did not get him
this year,</i>

40:48.880 --> 40:50.447
<i>but on the Domino Pipes,</i>

40:50.449 --> 40:53.383
<i>he stumbled and just barely
grabbed the pad</i>

40:53.385 --> 40:55.318
<i>and managed to save himself,</i>

40:55.320 --> 40:58.321
<i>and at 42,
he's the oldest ever</i>

40:58.323 --> 41:00.390
<i>to finish stage one.</i>

41:00.959 --> 41:03.193
<i>- Coming up, Jesse Labreck's</i>

41:03.195 --> 41:05.128
<i>already hit
one buzzer this year.</i>

41:05.130 --> 41:06.129
<i>Oh, my.</i>

41:06.131 --> 41:07.464
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>

41:07.466 --> 41:08.465
- Yeah!

41:08.467 --> 41:09.966
<i>- Now Flex is ready to go</i>

41:09.968 --> 41:12.168
<i>all the way on stage one.</i>

41:12.170 --> 41:14.404
- Nothing's gonna
stop me tonight.

41:14.406 --> 41:18.208
<i>- And later, he's one
of ninja's biggest stars.</i>

41:18.210 --> 41:20.677
- I want to be a cowboy
when I grow up.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.078
<i>- But back at the ranch,</i>

41:22.080 --> 41:25.181
<i>Lance Pekus' hero
is his wife Heather.</i>

41:25.183 --> 41:28.151
- It's hard to see the person
you love just fall apart.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.453
<i>- For the first time,
the Cowboy Ninja</i>

41:30.455 --> 41:32.755
<i>reveals his family's battle</i>

41:32.757 --> 41:35.758
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

41:38.863 --> 41:40.997
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior's"</i>

41:40.999 --> 41:43.466
<i>national finals, just
off the Strip in Las Vegas.</i>

41:43.468 --> 41:45.802
<i>While we were away,
it was double trouble</i>

41:45.804 --> 41:47.604
<i>for three of our rookies.</i>

41:47.606 --> 41:50.206
<i>First, it was the only
hometown competitor,</i>

41:50.208 --> 41:52.809
<i>Las Vegas college student
Jelani Allen.</i>

41:52.811 --> 41:54.110
<i>- Oh!
- No.</i>

41:54.112 --> 41:55.745
<i>That's a hard one
to figure out.</i>

41:55.747 --> 41:58.348
<i>- As he became the sixth victim
of this deadly new obstacle,</i>

41:58.350 --> 42:00.049
<i>the Double Dipper.</i>

42:00.051 --> 42:03.887
<i>And then it was Wisconsin
college student Luke Chambers,</i>

42:03.889 --> 42:07.357
<i>who made it to the second bar
but couldn't hang on.</i>

42:07.359 --> 42:09.025
<i>- And a big splash.</i>

42:09.027 --> 42:11.995
<i>- A third rookie,
Georgia's Michael Johnson</i>

42:11.997 --> 42:15.298
<i>at 6'1" still didn't have
the reach.</i>

42:15.300 --> 42:16.566
<i>- Oh.</i>

42:16.568 --> 42:18.101
<i>- And he became
the eighth athlete</i>

42:18.103 --> 42:21.504
<i>whose season ended
at the Double Dipper.</i>

42:21.506 --> 42:23.139
<i>Well, as we celebrate the best</i>

42:23.141 --> 42:24.541
<i>in the "Ninja Warrior"
community,</i>

42:24.543 --> 42:25.875
we are thrilled to have
one of the best

42:25.877 --> 42:27.844
in the broadcasting community,

42:27.846 --> 42:30.747
our fellow NBC man
Mike Tirico

42:30.749 --> 42:32.048
joining us up here
in the host tower.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.483
- What's up, Mike?
- Matt, Akbar, it's great

42:33.485 --> 42:34.651
- to be with you guys.
- Hey, thank you very much.

42:34.653 --> 42:35.685
We love having you
in the family.

42:35.687 --> 42:36.986
- Well, this is great.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.488
We're down to the end
of the season here.

42:38.490 --> 42:40.490
What a scene in Vegas.
This is wild, and it's tough.

42:40.492 --> 42:41.891
The conditions are very tough
for these guys.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.526
- It is hot.

42:43.528 --> 42:45.461
Well, and you know what it is to
operate under tough conditions.

42:45.463 --> 42:47.096
All Thursday, every Thursday,

42:47.098 --> 42:48.698
you're gonna be doing
the NFL for NBC,

42:48.700 --> 42:50.033
but most importantly,

42:50.035 --> 42:51.501
this winter,
you're gonna take over

42:51.503 --> 42:53.736
as the primetime host
for the Winter Olympics.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.438
- Yeah, here we are.
- It's 100 degrees here at night,

42:55.440 --> 42:57.340
and we're talking about
the Winter Olympics, right?

42:57.342 --> 42:59.075
Go figure.
It'll be none of this.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.811
It'll be on ice
and on blades and on skis.

43:01.813 --> 43:04.681
- We've lined up a guy
who we've got running right now

43:04.683 --> 43:06.049
<i>who is looking to compete
in the Summer Olympics</i>

43:06.051 --> 43:07.617
<i>- in rock climbing.
- That's right.</i>

43:07.619 --> 43:10.386
<i>- Which will start as
an Olympic sport in 2020.</i>

43:10.388 --> 43:13.656
<i>This is Josh Levin,
one of America's top climbers</i>

43:13.658 --> 43:16.459
<i>and one of our top
ninja athletes.</i>

43:16.461 --> 43:18.461
<i>We told you earlier this season
about he and fellow climber</i>

43:18.463 --> 43:20.563
<i>Charlie Andrews' friendship,</i>

43:20.565 --> 43:23.499
<i>and their plan to compete here
together in Las Vegas,</i>

43:23.501 --> 43:26.703
<i>but because of an accident,
that won't happen this year.</i>

43:27.739 --> 43:30.106
I was still happy.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.041
- You know, I was still happy.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.310
Josh Levin and I
have known each other

43:34.312 --> 43:37.213
for about 14 years now,

43:37.215 --> 43:41.384
<i>and I think we've become
like brothers.</i>

43:41.386 --> 43:44.020
<i>- Boom.
- Dominating it.</i>

43:44.022 --> 43:45.455
<i>- Look at that, fight it.</i>

43:45.457 --> 43:47.223
- Being able to hit
the city finals buzzers

43:47.225 --> 43:48.558
together with Charlie...

43:48.560 --> 43:52.695
<i>- Charlie Andrews. Josh Levin.</i>
- Ahh!

43:52.697 --> 43:55.632
One of the most incredible
feelings of our entire lives.

43:55.634 --> 43:59.402
<i>- And he and Charlie are
heading to the national finals.</i>

43:59.404 --> 44:01.671
- Vegas, here we come.

44:01.673 --> 44:03.373
But a couple weeks
after we competed in LA,

44:03.375 --> 44:04.707
Charlie and I
were training together,

44:04.709 --> 44:07.110
and he unfortunately
had an injury.

44:07.112 --> 44:08.911
Whoa!

44:08.913 --> 44:10.079
- Dude, you okay?

44:10.081 --> 44:12.749
- Oh, my God, Charlie.
- Charlie!

44:12.751 --> 44:15.685
- We need a medic, now.

44:15.687 --> 44:17.353
- It was really a scary
moment for me,

44:17.355 --> 44:20.256
<i>seeing him injured like that.</i>

44:20.258 --> 44:24.360
- I later woke up
in the hospital.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.062
<i>I had fractured my skull.</i>

44:27.832 --> 44:31.968
There were times at which
I was close to death.

44:31.970 --> 44:33.636
It's been something
that's taken months for me

44:33.638 --> 44:36.606
to really come to terms with,

44:36.608 --> 44:39.575
<i>and I was really grateful
to have Josh there.</i>

44:39.577 --> 44:42.745
<i>He visited the hospital
pretty much continuously</i>

44:42.747 --> 44:44.113
while I was in there,

44:44.115 --> 44:45.648
and once I got out,

44:45.650 --> 44:50.153
he supported my family
and supported me a lot.

44:50.155 --> 44:52.488
- Wow.
- This is pretty sweet.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.057
Thank you so much, guys.

44:54.059 --> 44:56.292
This made me really happy.

44:56.294 --> 44:57.760
- The dream, of course,
was for Charlie and I

44:57.762 --> 45:00.263
to compete alongside
each other in Las Vegas.

45:00.265 --> 45:02.131
Of course, we're not able
to do that anymore,

45:02.133 --> 45:04.367
<i>but it doesn't change the fact
that we're still there,</i>

45:04.369 --> 45:06.402
<i>supporting each other
the entire way.</i>

45:07.205 --> 45:11.741
- I'm well enough to stand up
and to cheer for my best friend,

45:11.743 --> 45:13.543
<i>and that's a gift.</i>

45:13.545 --> 45:14.844
<i>- We're taking our
combined energies,</i>

45:14.846 --> 45:16.512
<i>and we're gonna complete
all four stages,</i>

45:16.514 --> 45:19.148
and hopefully hit the buzzer
at the top of Midoriyama.

45:19.150 --> 45:21.350
<i>♪ ♪</i>

45:21.352 --> 45:23.386
- Go, Josh.

45:23.388 --> 45:25.154
<i>- Charlie's recovery
is going well.</i>

45:25.156 --> 45:27.256
<i>He plans to compete
again next year,</i>

45:27.258 --> 45:29.459
<i>and we're thrilled that
he's here to support Josh.</i>

45:29.461 --> 45:31.561
<i>- Absolutely.
- Let's watch Josh here.</i>

45:33.631 --> 45:35.965
<i>- And, Mike, I'm sure Josh is
feeling some pressure,</i>

45:35.967 --> 45:37.900
<i>feeling like he's running
for the both of them.</i>

45:37.902 --> 45:39.268
<i>- He gets through Snake Run,</i>

45:39.270 --> 45:41.137
<i>heading up to
the Propeller Bar.</i>

45:41.139 --> 45:42.705
<i>- Well, and we know
his upper-body strength.</i>

45:42.707 --> 45:44.273
<i>He's got to show
that athleticism.</i>

45:44.275 --> 45:46.642
<i>- Ooh! An incredible save
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

45:46.644 --> 45:47.677
<i>A little tangled up.</i>

45:47.679 --> 45:49.178
<i>- Man, timing's been tough,</i>

45:49.180 --> 45:50.880
<i>that transition there,
for people throughout.</i>

45:50.882 --> 45:52.949
<i>- Absolutely.</i>
- There we go.

45:52.951 --> 45:55.351
<i>- But got to be careful here
on the Double Dipper.</i>

45:55.353 --> 45:57.754
<i>It's already taken out
some good ones.</i>

45:57.756 --> 45:59.689
<i>- Oh, here we go.</i>

45:59.691 --> 46:02.024
<i>Josh Levin,
he's got to let it flow.</i>

46:02.026 --> 46:04.293
<i>Let it go.
Right there, nice transition.</i>

46:04.295 --> 46:06.262
<i>- Boy, the good ones
make it look so easy.</i>

46:06.264 --> 46:07.864
- On the transition especially.
- Yes.

46:07.866 --> 46:09.932
- All the ones who have
succeed here tonight.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.435
<i>- But now another tough one,
the Jumping Spider.</i>

46:12.437 --> 46:13.436
<i>And look at him...</i>

46:13.438 --> 46:14.904
<i>- Ooh.</i>

46:14.906 --> 46:16.439
<i>- Just gets it locked in
on the Jumping Spider.</i>

46:16.441 --> 46:18.141
<i>- And he's only 5'6"</i>

46:18.143 --> 46:20.409
<i>but having no problem
working through the chute.</i>

46:20.411 --> 46:24.046
<i>- And he's not known as a speed
guy, but he's really moving.</i>

46:24.048 --> 46:26.516
<i>Gets through,
now heading to Parkour Run.</i>

46:26.518 --> 46:27.750
<i>- And the guys
who have been getting</i>

46:27.752 --> 46:29.452
this part of the course
done quick,

46:29.454 --> 46:31.654
they've been able to take their
time when the pressure gets on,

46:31.656 --> 46:33.089
- Absolutely.
- So this is really important.

46:33.091 --> 46:35.424
<i>Just to collect yourself
like Josh is right here.</i>

46:35.426 --> 46:37.393
<i>- It's gonna take physical
and mental fortitude</i>

46:37.395 --> 46:39.862
<i>to complete the next
couple of obstacles.</i>

46:39.864 --> 46:41.831
<i>- Well, it's like watching
Belichick or something.</i>

46:41.833 --> 46:44.400
<i>The good ones, right,
they got a plan.</i>

46:44.402 --> 46:45.535
<i>Doing it the Levin way here.</i>

46:45.537 --> 46:47.837
- Nice form, man.

46:47.839 --> 46:49.705
<i>- Charlie cheering
his best friend on now,</i>

46:49.707 --> 46:51.808
<i>as he faces
the Warped Wall,</i>

46:51.810 --> 46:54.110
<i>but this is where fatigue
starts to set in.</i>

46:54.112 --> 46:56.646
<i>This wall's a lot tougher
on tired legs.</i>

46:58.383 --> 46:59.982
<i>He gets it.</i>

46:59.984 --> 47:03.286
<i>This guy's a 19-time national
champion speed climber,</i>

47:03.288 --> 47:06.189
<i>so he's very comfortable
on upper-body obstacles,</i>

47:06.191 --> 47:08.825
<i>but these Domino Pipes
are all about balance.</i>

47:08.827 --> 47:10.226
<i>- So you're telling me,
once he gets through</i>

47:10.228 --> 47:11.828
<i>the Domino Pipes,
he's gonna be all right</i>

47:11.830 --> 47:13.196
<i>because of
the climbing ability.</i>

47:13.198 --> 47:15.364
<i>- He should be,
but we've seen people</i>

47:15.366 --> 47:17.633
<i>get tripped up
on the transfers,</i>

47:17.635 --> 47:20.036
<i>but that final obstacle
surprisingly can take</i>

47:20.038 --> 47:21.838
<i>sometimes 30 seconds.</i>

47:21.840 --> 47:24.473
<i>- He's through.</i>
- Yes, Josh!

47:24.475 --> 47:27.977
<i>- One obstacle away
from a return trip to stage two.</i>

47:27.979 --> 47:31.113
<i>Left himself a lot of time
but we've seen mistakes here.</i>

47:31.115 --> 47:34.016
<i>- Pressure situation now.
- That time is ticking down.</i>

47:34.018 --> 47:35.051
<i>Got to be able
to make that transfer.</i>

47:35.053 --> 47:36.519
<i>You're tired. So what?</i>

47:36.521 --> 47:38.921
<i>- Well, we often talk
about clock management.</i>

47:38.923 --> 47:40.223
<i>- It's important in the NFL.
- That's right.</i>

47:40.225 --> 47:41.991
<i>- It's important
in "Ninja Warrior."</i>

47:41.993 --> 47:44.627
<i>- He'll get the momentum here
to take care of the last part.</i>

47:44.629 --> 47:46.162
<i>We know he's got
the last part.</i>

47:46.164 --> 47:49.265
<i>- Yeah, this lache... ooh,
big lache, nice.</i>

47:49.267 --> 47:51.434
<i>- Well, his friend Charlie
couldn't compete,</i>

47:51.436 --> 47:54.503
<i>but Josh Levin is gonna hit
the buzzer for both of them.</i>

47:54.505 --> 47:57.006
<i>He's going to stage two.</i>

47:57.008 --> 47:59.275
- Whoo!

47:59.277 --> 48:02.645
<i>- This run almost ended
on the second obstacle.</i>

48:02.647 --> 48:05.181
<i>He just barely got his hands
on the propeller,</i>

48:05.183 --> 48:08.618
<i>and only with those climbing
skills was he able to save it,</i>

48:08.620 --> 48:12.154
<i>and he cruised
the rest of the way.</i>

48:12.156 --> 48:15.191
<i>- And look at this.
- He's pointing to stage four.</i>

48:15.193 --> 48:16.993
<i>That's our Super Bowl,
Mike Tirico,</i>

48:16.995 --> 48:19.195
<i>and we'll see you
this Thursday</i>

48:19.197 --> 48:21.564
<i>for the "NFL on NBC's"
kickoff.</i>

48:21.566 --> 48:23.299
- Mike Tirico, congratulations.
- Thanks, Matt.

48:23.301 --> 48:24.767
- So glad to have you
in the family.

48:24.769 --> 48:26.068
- Great to be with you guys.
- Yeah, honor right here.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.503
- Bring it home.
- Great season, guys.

48:27.505 --> 48:29.805
- Thank you so much.
- All right, Akbar. Thanks.

48:29.807 --> 48:32.275
<i>- Well, it's one all-star
after another</i>

48:32.277 --> 48:34.277
<i>here in the finals,
like Jesse "Flex" Labreck.</i>

48:34.279 --> 48:35.912
<i>She's getting warmed up,</i>

48:35.914 --> 48:38.614
<i>and we'll see her run
when we come back.</i>

48:38.616 --> 48:42.285
<i>Plus, Allyssa Beird's
already had a big year.</i>

48:42.287 --> 48:44.420
<i>Ms. Beird has done it.</i>

48:44.422 --> 48:47.623
<i>Now this fifth grade teacher
is aiming even higher.</i>

48:47.625 --> 48:50.393
- Tonight I'm hitting the buzzer
for my kids.

48:50.395 --> 48:53.863
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

48:56.366 --> 48:58.134
<i>- Welcome back to night one
of the national finals</i>

48:58.136 --> 48:59.468
<i>in Las Vegas.</i>

48:59.470 --> 49:01.304
<i>Half the field
is running tonight.</i>

49:01.306 --> 49:04.974
<i>We'll see the rest next week,
including Jessie Graff,</i>

49:04.976 --> 49:07.343
<i>Drew Drechsel,
and Kacy Catanzaro</i>

49:07.345 --> 49:10.513
<i>in her final ninja season.</i>

49:10.515 --> 49:12.415
<i>And up next, it's one
of the year's top rookies.</i>

49:12.417 --> 49:15.885
<i>This is Alpharetta,
Georgia's Kevin Carbone.</i>

49:15.887 --> 49:18.354
<i>He's adopted the nickname
the Maker</i>

49:18.356 --> 49:20.356
<i>because he designed one
of our obstacles</i>

49:20.358 --> 49:22.024
<i>and then competed on it,</i>

49:22.026 --> 49:25.094
<i>and now he's made it all
the way to the national finals.</i>

49:25.096 --> 49:27.229
<i>He's truly living
the ninja dream.</i>

49:28.466 --> 49:30.299
<i>- I absolutely love
to design things.</i>

49:30.301 --> 49:33.903
- 10 foot, a 10 foot?
- Maybe a 2x8.

49:33.905 --> 49:35.805
- Kevin always has ideas.

49:35.807 --> 49:39.175
They flow out of Kevin
on a regular basis.

49:39.177 --> 49:40.776
<i>- I was thinking about ideas
for a while,</i>

49:40.778 --> 49:43.946
and I submitted one for
the Obstacle Design Challenge

49:43.948 --> 49:46.782
<i>called the Wingnut,
and they picked it.</i>

49:47.952 --> 49:50.086
<i>- Now the moment has arrived,</i>

49:50.088 --> 49:53.089
<i>facing the obstacle
of his own creation.</i>

49:53.091 --> 49:58.227
- To compete on this obstacle
I created was unreal.

49:58.229 --> 50:01.263
<i>- The Maker survives
the Wingnut.</i>

50:01.265 --> 50:02.798
- I feel like
a really lucky rookie

50:02.800 --> 50:05.134
to make it out here to Vegas.

50:05.136 --> 50:07.703
<i>It all feels like
it was meant to be.</i>

50:07.705 --> 50:10.306
I'm gonna keep coming up
with new obstacles,

50:10.308 --> 50:13.042
<i>and tonight
I'm gonna hit that buzzer.</i>

50:14.112 --> 50:15.811
<i>- Kevin has his parents
and his sister</i>

50:15.813 --> 50:18.114
<i>as well as some other friends
cheering him on.</i>

50:18.116 --> 50:19.749
- You got it, Kevin!

50:21.986 --> 50:24.587
<i>- Well, Kevin Carbone's
just 22 years old.</i>

50:24.589 --> 50:25.855
<i>Oh, my.</i>

50:25.857 --> 50:27.556
<i>- Ooh, can't make
a mistake there.</i>

50:27.558 --> 50:28.891
<i>- The rookie survives,</i>

50:28.893 --> 50:31.160
<i>and right on
to the Propeller Bar.</i>

50:31.162 --> 50:33.362
<i>- And look how quick
he grabbed that rope.</i>

50:33.364 --> 50:35.598
<i>- But gets through.</i>
- Yeah, Kevin!

50:35.600 --> 50:37.666
<i>- Well, he knows how
to design obstacles,</i>

50:37.668 --> 50:40.036
<i>but can he figure out
the Double Dipper?</i>

50:40.038 --> 50:42.705
<i>- Let me tell you,
this is a tricky one.</i>

50:42.707 --> 50:44.540
<i>- Real smooth
on the Double Dipper.</i>

50:44.542 --> 50:46.542
<i>- He ain't wasting no time.</i>

50:46.544 --> 50:48.210
<i>- Already through
three obstacles</i>

50:48.212 --> 50:49.912
<i>with more than
two minutes left.</i>

50:49.914 --> 50:52.248
<i>Now facing
the Jumping Spider.</i>

50:52.250 --> 50:53.582
<i>- Go, inside. Ooh.</i>

50:53.584 --> 50:56.185
<i>No!</i>

50:57.255 --> 51:00.423
<i>- Can't make it
into the Jumping Spider,</i>

51:00.425 --> 51:02.391
<i>and the impressive run
of this rookie</i>

51:02.393 --> 51:04.060
<i>comes to an end.</i>

51:04.062 --> 51:08.397
<i>- The chute's 4 feet wide
in here but 6 feet out here,</i>

51:08.399 --> 51:11.133
<i>and Carbone's feet land
out on the wide part,</i>

51:11.135 --> 51:16.305
<i>so he couldn't hold himself up,
and his dream season is over.</i>

51:16.307 --> 51:19.575
- Oh, man, I underestimated
that obstacle.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.277
It is tough.

51:21.279 --> 51:24.447
<i>- Up next, one of our biggest
runs of the night.</i>

51:24.449 --> 51:26.449
<i>One of our strongest
competitors,</i>

51:26.451 --> 51:28.017
<i>Jesse "Flex" Labreck.</i>

51:28.019 --> 51:29.885
<i>She made history as a rookie,</i>

51:29.887 --> 51:31.854
<i>and tonight
she's got a real shot</i>

51:31.856 --> 51:34.457
<i>to join the other Jessie,
Jessie Graff,</i>

51:34.459 --> 51:36.525
<i>as the only woman ever
to finish stage one,</i>

51:36.527 --> 51:38.060
<i>but if she did it,</i>

51:38.062 --> 51:39.128
<i>it might be even harder</i>

51:39.130 --> 51:41.297
<i>to tell the two Jesses apart.</i>

51:44.735 --> 51:47.403
<i>- Jessie Graff is one of the
strongest women I've ever seen.</i>

51:47.405 --> 51:49.872
<i>- Oh!</i>

51:49.874 --> 51:52.808
- But for some reason,
we always get confused

51:52.810 --> 51:54.743
just because of our first name.

51:54.745 --> 51:56.579
<i>Jessie Graff has blond hair.</i>

51:56.581 --> 51:59.682
She wears these awesome,
like, sparkly outfits.

51:59.684 --> 52:03.085
<i>I have the brown hair,
the average outfits.</i>

52:03.087 --> 52:06.055
<i>- That girl is a Labreck house.</i>

52:07.758 --> 52:09.859
<i>- My boyfriend Chris
told his aunt</i>

52:09.861 --> 52:12.495
<i>that he was dating Jesse,
and she was like,</i>

52:12.497 --> 52:14.563
<i>"Oh, the blond one
with the pigtails?"</i>

52:14.565 --> 52:17.233
And he was like,
"Nope, the other one."

52:18.703 --> 52:20.936
The not-as-good one.

52:21.772 --> 52:22.972
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>

52:22.974 --> 52:25.040
<i>- She's gonna make history.</i>

52:25.042 --> 52:27.109
- Herstory!
- That's herstory right there.

52:27.111 --> 52:30.146
- The first woman ever
to complete stage one.

52:30.148 --> 52:31.814
<i>- I would really like
to show them</i>

52:31.816 --> 52:34.683
<i>that I'm capable of hitting
that stage one buzzer too.</i>

52:34.685 --> 52:37.319
Watch out, stage one, 'cause
Flex Labreck is coming for you.

52:39.423 --> 52:40.923
<i>- Well, her boyfriend Chris,
who fell earlier,</i>

52:40.925 --> 52:42.658
<i>looks nervous.</i>

52:42.660 --> 52:46.328
<i>He's joined by Jon Alexis Jr.,
Jesse's father, and Emeline,</i>

52:46.330 --> 52:48.164
<i>her good friend
with cerebral palsy</i>

52:48.166 --> 52:50.266
<i>that Jesse helped care for.</i>

52:52.703 --> 52:56.505
<i>Well, Flex Labreck
last season without a doubt</i>

52:56.507 --> 52:58.607
<i>the woman rookie of the year,</i>

52:58.609 --> 53:01.810
<i>went further than any woman
ever had in her first season,</i>

53:01.812 --> 53:04.647
<i>but now the Propeller Bar.
Makes the grab.</i>

53:04.649 --> 53:07.349
<i>- Well, she's 5'7",
taller than some of the others,</i>

53:07.351 --> 53:08.884
<i>and so strong.</i>

53:08.886 --> 53:11.020
<i>- Heading up
to the Double Dipper.</i>

53:11.022 --> 53:13.289
<i>- This has caused problems
all night.</i>

53:13.291 --> 53:14.857
<i>Got to get the timing
just right</i>

53:14.859 --> 53:16.492
<i>when you release
that first bar.</i>

53:16.494 --> 53:18.060
<i>All right, watch out.</i>

53:18.062 --> 53:19.762
<i>This thing can get hostile
here on the transfer.</i>

53:19.764 --> 53:21.630
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

53:21.632 --> 53:23.599
<i>- Perfect.</i>
- Yes, yes!

53:23.601 --> 53:25.034
- Here we go.

53:25.036 --> 53:26.168
<i>- But this is where
she went out last year,</i>

53:26.170 --> 53:27.670
<i>the Jumping Spider.</i>

53:27.672 --> 53:29.305
<i>- Mm, stop, think about it.</i>

53:29.307 --> 53:32.074
<i>- Didn't get deep enough
into the chute last year.</i>

53:32.076 --> 53:33.442
<i>- All right, get in there.
- Get in there deep.</i>

53:33.444 --> 53:35.344
<i>- Get in there.</i>
- Yes!

53:35.346 --> 53:38.447
<i>- Well, Jesse Labreck learns
from her mistakes,</i>

53:38.449 --> 53:41.016
<i>and mistakes are something
she does not make often.</i>

53:41.018 --> 53:44.386
<i>- Remember, only three women
have ever gotten past this.</i>

53:44.388 --> 53:46.555
<i>Barclay Stockett
did it earlier.</i>

53:46.557 --> 53:49.658
<i>- And she's through
with plenty of time.</i>

53:49.660 --> 53:51.427
- Let's go, Jesse.

53:51.429 --> 53:53.095
<i>- Close friend Allyssa Beird
taking notes.</i>

53:53.097 --> 53:54.263
<i>She'll run later.</i>

53:54.265 --> 53:56.098
<i>But now Parkour Run.</i>

53:56.100 --> 53:58.500
<i>Labreck ran track
at the University of Maine,</i>

53:58.502 --> 53:59.568
<i>did hurdles.</i>

53:59.570 --> 54:00.636
<i>- Watch out for these angles.</i>

54:00.638 --> 54:02.204
<i>- Very cautious approach,</i>

54:02.206 --> 54:04.540
<i>not really trusting herself
to bound through it.</i>

54:04.542 --> 54:08.544
<i>Clock ticking, needs to make
the quick dismount on the rope.</i>

54:08.546 --> 54:10.646
<i>- Stick it. No!</i>

54:10.648 --> 54:13.616
<i>- And completely passes by
the landing platform</i>

54:13.618 --> 54:15.551
<i>just like her boyfriend
Chris did.</i>

54:15.553 --> 54:18.587
<i>- I think that slow approach
really does kill the momentum.</i>

54:18.589 --> 54:20.589
<i>- Got to get... oh, my,
misses again.</i>

54:20.591 --> 54:22.291
<i>- No. No, Matt.</i>

54:22.293 --> 54:24.927
<i>- And she needs to push back,
push the other direction.</i>

54:24.929 --> 54:27.796
<i>Oh, my, this is so frustrating.</i>

54:27.798 --> 54:30.666
<i>- Oh, my, she's using a lot
of grip strength here.</i>

54:30.668 --> 54:32.301
<i>- Now less than a minute.</i>

54:32.303 --> 54:35.704
<i>Makes it through,
but will she have enough time?</i>

54:35.706 --> 54:38.007
<i>- She can't afford to make
any mistakes.</i>

54:38.009 --> 54:39.608
<i>- Got to get right up
the Warped Wall.</i>

54:39.610 --> 54:41.043
<i>And look at this endurance.</i>

54:41.045 --> 54:43.345
<i>She's forcing her way
through it and up.</i>

54:43.347 --> 54:45.080
<i>- I think she might be able
to make up time here.</i>

54:45.082 --> 54:46.515
<i>Don't count her out.</i>

54:46.517 --> 54:48.751
<i>- But this is where
Chris DiGangi stumbled.</i>

54:48.753 --> 54:50.185
<i>Got to watch
that foot placement.</i>

54:50.187 --> 54:53.088
<i>The track star,
the heptathlete from Maine.</i>

54:53.090 --> 54:55.724
<i>Come on! 34 seconds.</i>

54:55.726 --> 54:58.427
<i>- You better go right now.
- Trying to join Jessie Graff</i>

54:58.429 --> 55:01.797
<i>as the second female finisher
but she's got to go.</i>

55:01.799 --> 55:03.966
<i>Good up on the first one.
Watch the transition.</i>

55:03.968 --> 55:05.801
<i>And she can see the time
in front of her.</i>

55:05.803 --> 55:07.670
<i>She knows what she has to do.</i>

55:07.672 --> 55:09.705
<i>- Here she comes.</i>

55:09.707 --> 55:11.106
<i>What does she have left
out of the grip?</i>

55:11.108 --> 55:12.675
<i>- Oh, Matt, she's gonna do it.</i>

55:12.677 --> 55:14.510
<i>- 15 seconds.
- Come on.</i>

55:14.512 --> 55:15.944
<i>Come on, Labreck.</i>

55:15.946 --> 55:17.780
<i>No!</i>

55:17.782 --> 55:20.182
- What? No.
- No. No!

55:20.184 --> 55:22.584
<i>- Couldn't grab
onto the cargo net.</i>

55:22.586 --> 55:24.687
<i>I think she was just
exhausted,</i>

55:24.689 --> 55:25.754
<i>tried to rush it.</i>

55:25.756 --> 55:28.624
<i>So close but comes up short.</i>

55:28.626 --> 55:29.792
<i>- Here's where it went bad,</i>

55:29.794 --> 55:31.827
<i>back on the rope
at Parkour Run.</i>

55:31.829 --> 55:33.329
<i>She got her back turned</i>

55:33.331 --> 55:35.798
<i>and couldn't reach her feet out
to the landing area.</i>

55:35.800 --> 55:39.234
<i>She just swung by.
That cost her so much time.</i>

55:39.236 --> 55:40.903
<i>You could see it on her face,</i>

55:40.905 --> 55:42.304
<i>she was just pressing
at the end</i>

55:42.306 --> 55:44.473
<i>and couldn't get a grip
on the cargo net.</i>

55:44.475 --> 55:47.643
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine
for the POM Post Run Interview.</i>

55:47.645 --> 55:50.145
- Jesse, you got all the way
to the cargo net,

55:50.147 --> 55:51.313
- Yeah. Barely.

55:51.315 --> 55:52.848
- And I know
you could've done that.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.016
Was that what you were
thinking too?

55:54.018 --> 55:56.085
Was it just a time thing?

55:56.087 --> 55:58.020
- I definitely should've swung
one more time,

55:58.022 --> 55:59.822
but I got hung up on the rope
for so long

55:59.824 --> 56:01.857
<i>that I just got too tired,</i>

56:01.859 --> 56:04.626
<i>and by the time I got there,
I was just a little pumped out.</i>

56:04.628 --> 56:06.328
- I know that you and Emeline
don't get to see each other

56:06.330 --> 56:07.930
quite as often since you moved.

56:07.932 --> 56:09.998
What does it mean to have
her here supporting you?

56:10.000 --> 56:13.969
- Oh, it's so amazing that she
could come to Vegas and be here,

56:13.971 --> 56:15.938
and she is obviously
very happy about it,

56:15.940 --> 56:17.840
so it makes me really happy.

56:17.842 --> 56:20.042
- Well, she's happy, and she's
obviously so proud of you,

56:20.044 --> 56:21.610
as are we, Jesse. Congrats.

56:21.612 --> 56:24.546
- Thank you so much.
- Guys, back to you.

56:24.548 --> 56:27.116
<i>- Coming up,
big names still to come,</i>

56:27.118 --> 56:29.785
<i>including the Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky,</i>

56:29.787 --> 56:32.154
<i>the Speedster, Lorin Ball,</i>

56:35.893 --> 56:39.862
<i>But up next, no one wants it
more than JJ Woods.</i>

56:39.864 --> 56:42.464

<i>- The Miami stunt man hits

56:44.535 --> 56:48.270
<i>when we come back on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

56:51.875 --> 56:54.543
<i>- Welcome back to Las Vegas
and "American Ninja Warrior's"</i>

56:54.545 --> 56:57.079
<i>national finals.
While we were away,</i>

56:57.081 --> 57:00.349
<i>three more athletes tried

57:00.351 --> 57:01.984
<i>Iowa's Spencer Johnson</i>

57:01.986 --> 57:04.219
<i>put together
a strong run for a rookie.</i>

57:04.221 --> 57:07.823
<i>- Ooh, okay.
- But with the clock ticking...</i>

57:07.825 --> 57:09.124
<i>He needs to get going.</i>

57:09.126 --> 57:10.659
<i>The gymnastics coach</i>

57:10.661 --> 57:12.528
<i>couldn't stick the dismount
on the cargo net,</i>

57:12.530 --> 57:14.663
<i>and he ran out of time.</i>

57:14.665 --> 57:16.031
<i>- Oh, he's upside down.</i>

57:16.801 --> 57:19.201
<i>- Ian Dory was surprisingly
knocked out</i>

57:19.203 --> 57:22.371
<i>by the Propeller Bar
last year, but not tonight.</i>

57:22.373 --> 57:23.906
- Yeah, Ian, killing it.

57:23.908 --> 57:25.808
<i>- The four-time
national finalist</i>

57:25.810 --> 57:27.242
<i>made it a little close
at the end</i>

57:27.244 --> 57:29.878

57:29.880 --> 57:32.247
<i>Ian Dory moving on
to stage two.</i>

57:32.249 --> 57:36.185
<i>- Another top competitor,
San Antonio's Thomas Stillings,</i>

57:36.187 --> 57:38.320
<i>had no trouble
beating the clock.</i>

57:38.322 --> 57:41.757
<i>- I think the magic is in his
genie pants, it really is.</i>

57:41.759 --> 57:44.426
<i>- The Genie Ninja put up
the fastest time of the night</i>

57:44.428 --> 57:48.030
<i>so far, finishing with more
than 30 seconds to spare.</i>

57:48.032 --> 57:50.999
<i>- Hitting the buzzer

57:51.001 --> 57:52.334
<i>I see you, young fella.</i>

57:52.336 --> 57:53.702

57:57.608 --> 58:00.776
<i>It's Miami stunt man JJ Woods.</i>

58:00.778 --> 58:02.744

<i>You can't tell me
he's not ready to go.</i>

58:04.849 --> 58:07.549

<i>he's glad to be back
in the national finals.</i>

58:11.689 --> 58:13.989
<i>- JJ's getting

<i>- Last year in Atlanta,</i>

58:15.392 --> 58:19.061

58:19.063 --> 58:23.131

58:23.133 --> 58:25.300

I wanted to make sure

<i>He said, "Bump that. I ain't
messing with that rope."</i>

01:00:57.221 --> 01:01:00.122
<i>- JJ Woods electrifying
this crowd.</i>

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.357
- You're tearing
this course up, baby!

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:05.227
<i>- All right, but don't
overlook these Domino Pipes.</i>

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:08.630
<i>- And JJ once again pausing
to catch his breath.</i>

01:01:08.632 --> 01:01:10.766
<i>He knows he's in
good shape on time,</i>

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.567
<i>just wants to avoid a mistake.</i>

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.970
- 55, 55!

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:16.405
<i>- Flip's yelling out his time.</i>

01:01:16.407 --> 01:01:19.041
<i>- Don't get creative.
- Just move fast.</i>

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:22.344
<i>Come on, get on it.
On it like you want it.</i>

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:26.014
<i>- And right through it
and into the Flying Squirrel,</i>

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.918
<i>one obstacle away
from the buzzer.</i>

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.087
<i>- JJ Woods.
- All right, get with it.</i>

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:34.489
<i>No! Oh, he almost...</i>

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:36.024
<i>boy, he was so close.</i>

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.026
<i>- Not a great transition,
and watch him here</i>

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.194
<i>getting onto the cargo net.</i>

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.929
<i>- Come on, come on.</i>

01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:44.933
<i>- And compensates
that second time. JJ Woods.</i>

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:47.436
<i>- Oh, boy.
- What a comeback.</i>

01:01:47.438 --> 01:01:49.738
<i>After going out
on the second obstacle</i>

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.374
<i>in qualifying last year,</i>

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:54.810
<i>JJ Woods is headed back
to stage two.</i>

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:57.045
- Way to go, JJ!
- Good job, JJ!

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.146
- What's next?

01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:01.650
<i>- What a moment for JJ Woods.</i>

01:02:01.652 --> 01:02:03.952
<i>- Leave it to a stunt man
to put on a show.</i>

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:06.488
<i>He got big air
and landed on his back</i>

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.290
<i>on the Double Dipper</i>

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:11.159
<i>and then he gets creative
and just skips the rope</i>

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:13.628
<i>and hops to the end
of Parkour Run,</i>

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:16.331
<i>and JJ Woods is moving on.</i>

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:19.801
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine
for the POM Post Run Interview.</i>

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:21.903
- JJ, I know this feels great.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.572
I want to go back
to the Double Dipper, though,

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:25.774
because something really
important happened there.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:27.909
You did not use the switch grip,

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.378
which has been a very
important thing for you.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.580
Can you break that down to me?

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:33.248
- Oh, easy breakdown.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.383
If there were 300 people
on the course,

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:38.086
and 299 of them used
the switch grip,

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.821
I still would not use
the switch grip.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.023
<i>I learned my lesson in Atlanta.
Never again.</i>

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:43.658
- Does this feel like
redemption to you?

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.427
- Oh, my God, 100%
but it's not done yet.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:46.762
I got three more to go.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.396
- Oh, you're going all the way
to the top, huh?

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:51.199
- Oh, we're going to stage five,
where we pop bottles and party.

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:52.534
- We're gonna make up
a stage five.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.102
I like the way that sounds.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.972
Matt and Akbar, back to you.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.807
<i>- So JJ Woods currently has</i>

01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:00.909
<i>the third fastest finish
of the night.</i>

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:03.011
<i>The finishes
are starting to mount.</i>

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:07.682
<i>We're up to six athletes who've
hit the buzzer on stage one.</i>

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:10.485
<i>Well, the women have been
getting close all night.</i>

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:13.989
<i>Now fifth-grade teacher Allyssa
Beird is gonna get her shot.</i>

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:15.991
<i>We'll see her run
when we come back</i>

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:18.193
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:25.033
<i>- Welcome back to night one
of the national finals.</i>

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:27.769
<i>While we were away,
we saw some dramatic finishes</i>

01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:30.272
<i>from a handful of veterans.</i>

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:32.474
<i>The Giving Ninja,
Sean Darling-Hammond,</i>

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.309
<i>stumbled on the Domino Pipes.</i>

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.345
<i>- He got down to his knees.
- But the Washington, D.C.</i>

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:41.183
<i>attorney recovered to earn his
first-ever trip to stage two.</i>

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:43.485
<i>- I love it.
- I absolutely love it.</i>

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.420
<i>- Green Bay, Wisconsin's
Drew Knapp</i>

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:47.355
<i>took an even harder fall.</i>

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:50.959
<i>Oh, hard impact.
Tremendous save.</i>

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:52.994
<i>But the gymnastics coach
fought back,</i>

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:55.163
<i>and he also made it
to the buzzer.</i>

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.766
<i>You can't stop Knapp.</i>

01:03:57.768 --> 01:04:01.269
<i>Six-time veteran Mike Bernardo
took a different approach,</i>

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:03.939
<i>just diving over
the final pipes.</i>

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:05.607
<i>Leaps that final one.</i>

01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:08.176
<i>- He said, "Forget that."
- And the D.C. firefighter</i>

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.278
<i>flew all the way to the buzzer.</i>

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.014
<i>He's moving on to stage two.</i>

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.450
<i>Another crowd favorite,
Kevin Bull,</i>

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:17.419
<i>looked like he was
in big trouble</i>

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:19.721
<i>after missteps
on Parkour Run...</i>

01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:22.591
<i>- Oh, this is not good.
- And again on the Warped Wall.</i>

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:24.359
<i>And a miss!</i>

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:28.063
<i>But Bull bounced back and kept
the streak of finishes alive.</i>

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:30.098
<i>And the bull horns are up.</i>

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.267
- Whoo!

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:35.370
<i>- Well, our next competitor
has had a big year.</i>

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.739
<i>He found a whole new family.</i>

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:41.276
<i>This is Fort Collins, Colorado,
salon owner Dan Yager.</i>

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:43.178
<i>As we told you,
Dan was adopted,</i>

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.513
<i>and his appearances
on "American Ninja Warrior"</i>

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:49.251
<i>helped reunite him with
his biological father in Korea.</i>

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.119
<i>His new family even
watched his run</i>

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:54.456
<i>in Denver qualifying
on FaceTime.</i>

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:56.791
<i>Well, his Korean family
is back in Korea,</i>

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:58.393
<i>but his wife Sherri is here,</i>

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.695
<i>holding their
baby daughter Harlow.</i>

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:05.700
<i>- The last time Yager was
in the national finals,</i>

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:07.369
<i>he made it to stage two.</i>

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:10.205
<i>He's got the skills
to go far in this competition.</i>

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:12.774
<i>- Now the Propeller Bar.
- Good jump.</i>

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:14.376
<i>Yager has
a climbing background</i>

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:16.878
<i>like so many
of those Colorado ninjas.</i>

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.347
<i>Now facing the Double Dipper.</i>

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:22.617
<i>- But his daughter's not sure
she wants to watch.</i>

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:24.152
<i>- Well, this is a tough one.</i>

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:27.222
<i>No one's got one of these
in their backyard.</i>

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:29.190
<i>Careful. Careful.</i>

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:32.494
<i>- Oh, no.
- Oh, no, so close.</i>

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:37.399
<i>- Dan Yager says, "Oh, no."
He can't believe it,</i>

01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:40.936
<i>but there's very little margin
for error on the Double Dipper.</i>

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.470
<i>- Look at it overhead.</i>

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:43.805
<i>That left side
got out in front,</i>

01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:46.374
<i>and so he didn't get
a good lift-off.</i>

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:47.709
<i>You can see right there,</i>

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:50.578
<i>he just barely
touched that second bar.</i>

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.182
<i>This Double Dipper is doing
some damage tonight.</i>

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:57.919
- I lost my momentum and didn't
quite make it to the bar.

01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:00.722
<i>- Well, the women have been
impressive all night.</i>

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:05.627
<i>Barclay Stockett made it to the
final obstacle as time ran out,</i>

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:08.563
<i>and Jesse Labreck just missed
out on finishing the course.</i>

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:10.231
<i>No!</i>

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:12.200
<i>- And up next is the last one</i>

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.668
<i>to take on the course
this week.</i>

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.705
<i>It's fifth grade teacher
Allyssa Beird.</i>

01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:18.940
<i>She's had an incredible year,</i>

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:22.043
<i>joining a very exclusive
group of women competitors</i>

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:24.012
<i>when she hit a buzzer
in Cleveland.</i>

01:06:24.014 --> 01:06:27.582
<i>Now she's ready to see how
far she can go here in Vegas.</i>

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.386
- Leading up to Cleveland,
I only had it in my mind

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:32.787
that I wanted to hit a buzzer.

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:34.756
<i>That was my goal this season.</i>

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:36.091
<i>- Yes!</i>

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:38.994
<i>- Yes! Allyssa Beird.
- Yes! Yes!</i>

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:41.896
<i>- I don't really think
it hit me</i>

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:43.331
<i>that I had sort of joined</i>

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.033
<i>this elite group of women
that...</i>

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:47.669
<i>I think there's only six of us
now that have hit buzzers.</i>

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.904
<i>Now that I've got a buzzer
under my belt,</i>

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:51.639
<i>it is time to step up my game.</i>

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.410
- I mean, Allyssa, she's fast
and crazy strong.

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:58.279
I think she can do
just about anything.

01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:01.049
- Allyssa Beird
I train with all the time,

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:02.917
and we're constantly
pushing each other,

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:05.420
<i>and she is one of the strongest
women I have ever seen.</i>

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:07.889
- She's always impressing me
with how motivated she is

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:09.457
<i>and how hardworking she is.</i>

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:10.992
Done.

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:13.795
- Find a good stopping point
for today, please.

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:16.898
<i>Being a teacher, my day
is really busy at work,</i>

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.801
<i>but I've just been focusing
on whole-body training,</i>

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.836
<i>making sure that there's not
a single obstacle</i>

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:24.539
that I'm going to have
a big weakness on.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.007
<i>I want to prove to myself
as well</i>

01:07:26.009 --> 01:07:28.777
<i>as to everyone watching
that I can do this.</i>

01:07:28.779 --> 01:07:31.146
I can hit the buzzer.
I know I can beat stage one.

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:34.883

<i>already taken out about
a dozen competitors tonight.</i>

What did I say?</i>

<i>What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?</i>

<i>- Matt, I'm telling you,

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:31.005
<i>Jumping Spider,
it's all game for her.</i>

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.407
<i>Nice.</i>

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:35.076

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:40.215
<i>made it through this
in ninja history,</i>

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.383
<i>and now Beird could be
the third one tonight,</i>

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:44.352
<i>and she's got it.</i>

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.654
<i>These women doing
big things tonight.</i>

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:49.090
<i>Now on Parkour Run.</i>

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:51.493
<i>- All right, get this thing
going with Parkour Run.</i>

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:55.729
<i>The angles here are steep.</i>

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:59.067
<i>- A cautious approach but it's
working out for Ms. Beird.</i>

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:00.268
<i>- This rope
is where Flex Labreck</i>

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.870
<i>got into some trouble.</i>

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:04.005
<i>- Unlike Labreck, she needs
to stick her legs out</i>

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.305
<i>and catch the landing area.</i>

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.441
<i>- Get it, get it, get it.
- Ooh.</i>

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:08.609
<i> And look at that, 1:15 left.</i>

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:10.145
<i>- She's got a good time going,</i>

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:12.846
<i>but she's got to get up
the wall on her first try.</i>

01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:14.816
<i>- Taking a moment
to catch her breath.</i>

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:16.783
<i>Well, until Jessie Graff
got through it,</i>

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:18.987
<i>no woman had gotten up
this Warped Wall.</i>

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.356
<i>We've seen two already
get up it tonight.</i>

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:23.491
<i>The clock is ticking,
a minute left.</i>

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.960
<i>- Come on, now.</i>

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:28.662
- Got it!
- Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:32.300
<i>- She's done it, and this crowd
is losing their minds.</i>

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.636
<i>Just two more obstacles to go.</i>

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:38.406
<i>First up, the Domino Pipes.
Now about 45 seconds left.</i>

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:41.309
<i>- Go, go, go, Allyssa!
- Go, yes.</i>

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.578
<i>- Now just
the Flying Squirrel remains</i>

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.913
<i>between her and the buzzer.</i>

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.448
<i>And she makes the grab.</i>

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:49.951
<i>- Oh, my. Can your
fifth grade teacher do that?</i>

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:51.085
<i>- Allyssa Beird,</i>

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.321
<i>can she be
the second woman</i>

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.390
<i>ever to get through stage one?</i>

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:58.993
<i>- Matt, it's about to go down.
- It's about to go down right now.</i>

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:00.728
<i>- I got to say,
there are a lot of students</i>

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.063
<i>in her fifth grade class</i>

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.865
<i>who are clapping
their hands right now.</i>

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.266
<i>- Okay!</i>

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:07.368
<i>- Just needs to climb
the cargo net.</i>

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.837
<i>And this crowd
is on their feet.</i>

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:12.507
<i>The elementary school
teacher can add her name</i>

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:14.409
<i>to the history books.</i>

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:17.579
<i>Allyssa Beird,
the second woman ever</i>

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:19.714
<i>to hit the buzzer
on stage one.</i>

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.182
- Oh, my God!

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.453
- Stage one!

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:29.157
<i>- What a run out
of Allyssa Beird.</i>

01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:32.227
<i>- We're gonna make that our</i>

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:35.096
<i>POM Wonderful Crazy Healthy
Run of the Night.</i>

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:39.434
<i>Allyssa Beird was just flying
on the Propeller Bar,</i>

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:42.403
<i>on the Double Dipper,
up the wall,</i>

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:47.008
<i>and finally onto the cargo net
and up to the buzzer.</i>

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:48.209
- She's standing by
with Kristine.

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:53.081
- Allyssa, only the second woman

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:55.383
ever to complete stage one.

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.218
How does that sound to you?

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.953
- It sounds pretty good.
- It's what I came here to do,

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:00.755
and I hit that buzzer,
so I'm happy.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.390
<i>- All the women standing here
around you</i>

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:04.158
<i>are very happy for you tonight</i>

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.694
and that you are representing.
How does that feel?

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:09.697
- It feels amazing.
- These ninjas are my family,

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:12.033
so it just means so much
to have them here by my side.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:15.203
- The second woman ever
to complete stage one.

01:11:15.205 --> 01:11:16.771
Congratulations.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:19.040
We cannot wait to see you
on stage two, Allyssa.

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:21.809
- Thank you so much
- Guys, back to you.

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:24.846
<i>- Well, no American has ever
run stage one faster</i>

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:26.381
<i>than Joe Moravsky.</i>

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:28.283
<i>What's the Weatherman
gonna do tonight?</i>

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.617
<i>We'll see his run</i>

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.954
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.926
<i>- Welcome back to "American
Ninja Warrior" in Las Vegas,</i>

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:41.829
.<i>where it's night one</i>
<i>of the national finals.</i>

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:44.065
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes</i>

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:46.067
<i>took their shot on stage one.</i>

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:49.304
<i>Ben Baker is a logger
from a small town in Georgia,</i>

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:51.906
<i>and he came up
with some big saves,</i>

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:53.975
<i>like a one-handed grab
on the Double Dipper.</i>

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:55.443
<i>- Wow.</i>

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:57.278
<i>- And another close call
on the Jumping Spider.</i>

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.846
<i>- Save yourself, homey.</i>

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:01.249
<i>- After getting all the way
to the Flying Squirrel,</i>

01:12:01.251 --> 01:12:03.818
<i>he made another
one-handed grab.</i>

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.854
<i>- Oh, man, that's got to be
the best recovery of the night.</i>

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.257
<i>- But seconds later,
he was waterlogged.</i>

01:12:09.259 --> 01:12:12.126
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, no.</i>

01:12:12.128 --> 01:12:15.363
<i>- Ninja favorite Flip Rodriguez
was trying to get to stage two</i>

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:18.666
<i>for the third straight year.
Just so effortless.</i>

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.501
<i>And despite nursing
a hip injury,</i>

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.869
<i>the stunt man still put up</i>

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:23.771
<i>one of the best times
of the night.</i>

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:24.972
<i>- Flip Rodriguez.</i>
- Yes!

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:26.774
We are the lions.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:29.911
<i>- Nothing can slow
this man down.</i>

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:32.880
<i>Then it was another top
veteran, Brent Steffensen,</i>

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:34.282
<i>who came out hot.</i>

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:35.917
<i>- He ain't wasting no time.</i>

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.819
<i>- The seven-time veteran
earned a ticket</i>

01:12:37.821 --> 01:12:41.656
<i>to stage two with the fastest
run of the night so far.</i>

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:44.892
<i>- As strong as we've seen
Steffensen look in many years.</i>

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:50.164
<i>But if there's anyone who knows
how to go fast on stage one,</i>

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:53.968
<i>it's our next competitor.
He's one of the all-time greats.</i>

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.170
<i>It's the Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky,</i>

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:58.873
<i>the meteorologist
from Monroe, Connecticut.</i>

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:02.210
<i>Three years ago, in our USA
Versus the World competition,</i>

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.846
<i>he broke Brent Steffensen's
stage one record</i>

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.848
<i>by finishing in just 1:12.</i>

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:11.085
<i>- That was too fast.
- That was too fast. Wow.</i>

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:14.288
<i>- Here to watch how fast
Joe can go</i>

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.190
<i>is his wife Stephanie
on the left,</i>

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:19.227
<i>more than six months pregnant
with their second child.</i>

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:22.196
<i>She's joined on the sidelines
by Joe's cousins.</i>

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:24.699
<i>How fast will
the Weatherman go tonight?</i>

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:26.701
<i>Since he came on
in season five,</i>

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:30.538
<i>has established himself as
the most consistent performer.</i>

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.007
<i>And a nice, high leap
onto the Propeller Bar.</i>

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:35.209
<i>- Oh, wow, that propeller
almost took his head off.</i>

01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:36.744
<i>- But he clears it.</i>

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:39.046
<i>Moravsky making his
fifth appearance in Vegas.</i>

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:41.516
<i>First time, though,
seeing the Double Dipper.</i>

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:44.619
<i>- If he likes speed,
he's gonna love this one.</i>

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:45.953
<i>- And he's through,</i>

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.389
<i>going right into
the Jumping Spider.</i>

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:51.259
<i>Well, he is barreling
through this course,</i>

01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:53.428
<i>a reckless pace
out of Moravsky.</i>

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:54.929
<i>I think he wants
the fastest time.</i>

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.964
<i>- Oh, this dude is a banger.</i>

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:59.033
<i>- Well, Steffensen has
the time to beat.</i>

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:00.835
<i>He had more than
33 seconds left</i>

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:03.104
<i>when he hit the buzzer.</i>

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:06.340
<i>- Oh, man, just making
easy work of Parkour Run.</i>

01:14:06.342 --> 01:14:07.475
<i>- Has to stick the dismount.</i>

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:09.777
<i>- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Good save.</i>

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.179
<i>- You got it, you got it.</i>

01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:12.947
<i>- Having a little fun
out here.</i>

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.450
<i>Moravsky by far the fastest</i>

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:17.285
<i>we've seen anyone
to this point.</i>

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.821
<i>- He's still got a minute left
to beat Steffensen.</i>

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:21.823
<i>- And right up the Warped Wall
with ease,</i>

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:24.225
<i>now only two more
obstacles to go.</i>

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:26.127
<i>- All right, now he's
slowing down a little.</i>

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:27.361
<i>Just gonna have to
catch his breath</i>

01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:28.963
<i>before Domino Pipes.</i>

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.798
<i>- Balance obstacles
always challenging</i>

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.901
<i>even for top veterans,</i>

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:38.072
<i>and right over the final pipe
and no hesitation.</i>

01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:41.375
<i>- Well, we know Joe Moravsky
can fly on the Flying Squirrel.</i>

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:42.910
<i>- Well, in a loaded field,</i>

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:46.414
<i>Joe Moravsky
is making a statement.</i>

01:14:46.416 --> 01:14:49.517
<i>- He's got nearly a minute
to finish the course.</i>

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:51.452
<i>Joe Moravsky
is a savvy veteran.</i>

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:59.160
<i>- And look how high he lands
on the cargo net, saving time,</i>

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:02.330
<i>and Joe Moravsky's
gonna top Steffensen's time</i>

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.832
<i>and be our 14th finisher
of the night.</i>

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.639
<i>What's he doing?</i>

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:13.508
<i>- He's gonna do
a Jake Murray cannonball.</i>

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:18.279
<i>- The Weatherman
making a splash,</i>

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.014
<i>moving on to stage two.</i>

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.984
<i>- He nearly got his head
taken off by the Propeller Bar,</i>

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:24.819
<i>but that didn't slow him down.</i>

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:28.489
<i>He just kept going and put up
the fastest time of the night</i>

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:31.092
<i>with a high dive
to top it off.</i>

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:34.562
<i>- But there is so much
talent here in Vegas.</i>

01:15:34.564 --> 01:15:36.464
<i>That time may not last long</i>

01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:39.734
<i>because one of ninja's great
speed demons is up next.</i>

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:42.169
<i>It's Colorado
gym owner Lorin Ball,</i>

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:43.538
<i>and he's has
an impressive résumé.</i>

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.107
<i>In city qualifying competition,</i>

01:15:46.109 --> 01:15:49.243
<i>he's been the fastest
competitor four straight years,</i>

01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:52.246
<i>and every year he's been
in Vegas and run stage one,</i>

01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:55.149
<i>he's been the second fastest
on this course.</i>

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.785
<i>- Oh, look at him, he's
revving up his V12 engine.</i>

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:03.190
<i>- Well, there you see
Joe Moravsky's time to beat.</i>

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:05.726
<i>That's the number Ball
will be gunning for.</i>

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:08.195
<i>Lorin Ball only knows
one speed.</i>

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:11.566
<i>We've seen that speed haunt him
at times, and yet this season,</i>

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:14.535
<i>it looks like he has found
the best of both worlds,</i>

01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:17.204
<i>using that speed
but finding the control.</i>

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.906
<i>- Well, if he wants to go fast,</i>

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.742
<i>he'll do it here
on the Double Dipper.</i>

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.579
<i>- Seems a little uncertain
about how to grip the bar.</i>

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:26.213
<i>- I know.
- That's not like Lorin Ball.</i>

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:28.082
<i>He doesn't usually stop
to think about things.</i>

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.083
<i>He just goes.</i>

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:33.921
Oh!

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:38.492
<i>- Wow, this crowd is stunned,
but Lorin Ball is a go fast</i>

01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:42.897
<i>or go home type guy,
and tonight he's going home.</i>

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:44.699
- That sucked.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.968
<i>- He couldn't decide
how to grip the bar,</i>

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:48.569
<i>and that may have
affected him.</i>

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:50.871
<i>He didn't get a good release
to that second bar.</i>

01:16:50.873 --> 01:16:52.406
<i>You could see right there,</i>

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:56.010
<i>he got both hands on it
but just couldn't hang on.</i>

01:16:56.012 --> 01:16:58.946
- I grabbed it, and it
spun backwards on me,

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.782
super simple mistake.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.018
<i>- Well, the Cowboy Ninja
is up next,</i>

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.221
<i>and it's gonna be an emotional
run for Lance Pekus.</i>

01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:09.624
<i>He and his wife will
share their story</i>

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.426
<i>when "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:17.999
<i>Oh!</i>

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:19.700
<i>- What was that?
- Did you see that?</i>

01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:21.636
<i>- Come on.</i>

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:24.438
<i>The national finals
are off and running,</i>

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.240
<i>and next week,
the rest of the field</i>

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:28.843
<i>takes on stage one.</i>

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:30.978
<i>We'll see Jessie Graff...</i>

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.513
<i>She's done it.</i>

01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:35.516
<i>- Drew Drechsel...</i>
- Whoo!

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:39.587
<i>- And what may be the final
run for Kacy Catanzaro.</i>

01:17:39.589 --> 01:17:44.825
<i>History is made.
You don't want to miss it.</i>

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:47.328
<i>Some great athletes
on tap next week,</i>

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:50.097
<i>but we've still got one
athlete left to go tonight,</i>

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:52.667
<i>and he is one of our
all-time favorites.</i>

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:56.470
<i>It's the Cowboy Ninja,
Idaho rancher Lance Pekus,</i>

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:58.939
<i>and you can see right there,
he's pointing to his wife</i>

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:01.676
<i>Heather, who's watching
from back in Idaho.</i>

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:02.843
<i>She hasn't been
on the sidelines</i>

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.345
<i>for Lance's runs this year,</i>

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:06.580
<i>and now they're ready
to share why.</i>

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:11.085
<i>- Me and Heather met each other
my first year in college.</i>

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:16.457
We just kind of both enjoyed
doing outdoor stuff and sports.

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:18.626
<i>- He had never ridden a horse.</i>

01:18:18.628 --> 01:18:21.762
Threw him out there
and he did really well.

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:23.964
He never left.

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:26.200
<i>- In her early 20s,
Heather got diagnosed</i>

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.802
<i>with an autoimmune disease</i>

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:30.938
<i>called multiple sclerosis,
or MS.</i>

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.473
<i>She was able to
get on medication,</i>

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:33.908
and she went
eight or nine years

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.844
without having any
symptoms or problems.

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:38.946
<i>- I was active. I ran.</i>

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:42.216
<i>I lifted weights.
I rode horses.</i>

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:45.252
<i>- But progressively over
the last 2 1/2, 3 years,</i>

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:46.587
<i>it's gotten bad.</i>

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:49.890
<i>She definitely struggles
to get around.</i>

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:56.430
<i>- I went from trying to run
to a walker in ten months.</i>

01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:05.039
We tried a whole bunch
of medicine and treatments.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:08.275
<i>My body just doesn't respond.</i>

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:18.886
<i>- It's hard to see the person
you love just fall apart.</i>

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:20.755
<i>She still works as
a high school counselor.</i>

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:22.323
She's dedicated to me, the kids,

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.959
the things she does
for us every day.

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:27.328
<i>I told her how inspiring
she is to me.</i>

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.396
<i>She said, "How can I be
an inspiration?</i>

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:32.133
I'm sick. How..."

01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:33.200
Sorry.

01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:42.977
<i>- I never imagined
having this,</i>

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:46.981
but I've always been
a really positive person,

01:19:46.983 --> 01:19:50.818

to remember me that way.</i>

She's by far the toughest

<i>What a strong woman
Heather is.</i>

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.718

<i>- Absolutely.

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:35.162
<i>taking off that hat too.</i>

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.463
<i>You know he means business.</i>

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:41.735
<i>- Well, Lance Pekus is happy

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:44.071
<i>He missed out last year
after an early exit</i>

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:45.639
<i>in city qualifying.</i>

01:20:45.641 --> 01:20:47.741
<i>- Only thing is, he's not
wearing tight jeans.</i>

01:20:47.743 --> 01:20:49.844
<i>- He didn't wear jeans
two years ago in Vegas.</i>

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:52.379
<i>That's the last I remember.</i>

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.348
<i>But now this very dangerous
Double Dipper.</i>

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.750
<i>Took out
Lorin Ball minutes ago.</i>

01:20:56.752 --> 01:20:58.552
<i>- The cowboy's got to ride
this one.</i>

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:00.487
<i>- Good transition.</i>

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:03.023
<i>- Nice tight movement.</i>

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:05.259
<i>- Heather's happy to see
that one behind him</i>

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:06.927
<i>but now the Jumping Spider,</i>

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:09.697
<i>which took him out
two years in a row.</i>

01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.932
<i>But a good jump
and he's locked in.</i>

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:13.767
<i>- Well, he built his own
Jumping Spider</i>

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:15.870
<i>back at the ranch
out of hay bales.</i>

01:21:15.872 --> 01:21:18.105
<i>He's not gonna fall
on this again.</i>

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:21.508
<i>- And already through
and headed for Parkour Run.</i>

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.444
<i>- And he's showing
strong cardio.</i>

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:25.412
<i>He's really not stopping
to take a breath.</i>

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:26.847
<i>- Bounding through it.</i>

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:29.049
<i>- The cowboy knows
how to handle a rope,</i>

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:31.252
<i>but he's got to stick
this landing now.</i>

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:33.921
<i>- And that's as fast as anyone
through Parkour Run,</i>

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:36.957
<i>and Pekus has
a blazing pace going here.</i>

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:40.561
<i>We thought Moravsky was fast,
but Pekus could beat his time.</i>

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:42.062
<i>- Look at this.</i>

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:44.465
<i>- Lance Pekus blowing away
this course,</i>

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:46.800
<i>and the crowd is
starting to take notice.</i>

01:21:46.802 --> 01:21:50.204
<i>- Two more obstacles to go.
- Can he keep up this pace?</i>

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:51.772
<i>- Now the Domino Pipes.</i>

01:21:51.774 --> 01:21:55.142
<i>A balance obstacle ended
his season early last year.</i>

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:59.813
<i>But he's through!
One more to go.</i>

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:01.916
<i>- Okay.
- Got about 30 seconds</i>

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:03.951
<i>if he wants
to beat Moravsky's time.</i>

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:06.654
<i>- Everybody here is going
crazy for the cowboy.</i>

01:22:06.656 --> 01:22:08.589
Lance! Lance!

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:10.491
<i>- Makes that second grab.</i>

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:12.760
<i>What a run for Lance Pekus.</i>

01:22:12.762 --> 01:22:15.863
<i>Now just needs to get
to the cargo net.</i>

01:22:15.865 --> 01:22:16.864
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

01:22:16.866 --> 01:22:18.632
<i>- Look at Lance.</i>

01:22:18.634 --> 01:22:22.036
<i>- Well, Heather Pekus has
to be so proud of her husband.</i>

01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:24.905
<i>He's turning
in the run of his life.</i>

01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:27.274
<i>Can he beat Moravsky's time?</i>

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.176
<i>- Come on, come on,
hit the buzzer.</i>

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:30.978
<i>Hit it.</i>

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.346
<i>- And he's done it!</i>

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:34.648
<i>The fastest time of the night.</i>

01:22:36.686 --> 01:22:37.851
<i>- What is he pulling out,
Matt?</i>

01:22:37.853 --> 01:22:39.420
<i>What is he pulling out?</i>

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:42.923
- And a little cowboy hat
for the buzzer.

01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:45.993
- Way to go, Lance Pekus.
- I love it.

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:48.195
<i>- Sending love to his family,</i>

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:50.898
<i>what a great moment
for the Cowboy Ninja.</i>

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.867
<i>- Lance Pekus was
absolutely flawless.</i>

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:56.303
<i>He barely paused
between obstacles,</i>

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:59.506
<i>and he ran his way to the
fastest finish of the night</i>

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:02.609
<i>and topped it all off
with a cowboy hat.</i>

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:05.512
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine,
who's standing by with Lance.</i>

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:08.749
- Lance, it has got to feel
so great

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:10.084
to be back up there,
hitting a buzzer.

01:23:10.086 --> 01:23:13.120
What's going through your mind?

01:23:13.122 --> 01:23:14.621
- It feels good to be
back here in Vegas

01:23:14.623 --> 01:23:16.757
and finally hit
another buzzer here.

01:23:16.759 --> 01:23:18.325
It's feeling really good.

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:20.494
It's kind of an emotional
run for me,

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:23.564
so it feels good
to be able to hit that buzzer

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:25.199
and move on to the next stage.

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:27.868
- Your wife is usually here
on the sidelines, watching you,

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.903
but tonight
she's watching on Skype.

01:23:29.905 --> 01:23:31.538
What does that mean to you?

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.108
<i>- It means the world to me
to have something positive</i>

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.543
<i>something like my stage one run
and for her to watch it.</i>

01:23:36.545 --> 01:23:38.212
<i>Heather's my inspiration
to keep pushing,</i>

01:23:38.214 --> 01:23:40.047
<i>'cause I know what she
goes through every day.</i>

01:23:40.049 --> 01:23:41.448
<i>It's just great.</i>

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:43.951
- Lance, congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:23:43.953 --> 01:23:46.487
- Matt.
<i>- So the Cowboy Ninja</i>

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:48.122
<i>rides back onto stage one</i>

01:23:48.124 --> 01:23:50.824
<i>and lassoes the

01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:54.128
<i>Other veterans returning

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:57.131
<i>Kevin Bull,

<i>and with just half
the field running tonight,</i>

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:02.336
<i>we ended up with 20 athletes

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:03.971
<i>including Allyssa Beird,</i>

01:24:03.973 --> 01:24:07.041
<i>the second woman ever

01:24:07.043 --> 01:24:08.642
Well, that's it for tonight.

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:11.812
For Akbar Gbajabiamila and
Kristine Leahy, I'm Matt Iseman.

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:15.149
We'll see you next time
on "American Ninja Warrior."
