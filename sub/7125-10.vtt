00:03.350 --> 00:04.670
A little science lesson--

00:04.810 --> 00:06.530
Listen up, then you can have a snack.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.830
One type of memory is motor memory

00:08.980 --> 00:10.390
Or muscle memory.

00:10.630 --> 00:12.140
It's how even an amnesia

00:12.140 --> 00:14.050
Can still work a toothbrush, dial a phone

00:14.580 --> 00:15.870
Or even skip a rope.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.540
Then there's something called emotional memory--

00:21.960 --> 00:23.720
Things your body just knows,

00:23.840 --> 00:25.290
Like "don't touch fire"

00:25.500 --> 00:27.830
Or "i really like this guy."

00:28.060 --> 00:30.780
Hey, you two. sam, what are you doing?

00:30.960 --> 00:32.729
uh, double dutch.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.940
how about you? What have you been up to?

00:36.170 --> 00:38.360
Oh, you know, uh, pling a lot of jacks.

00:39.410 --> 00:40.880
I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.

00:41.030 --> 00:43.400
Oh, I know, I know. so how are you?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.600
How's, um, how's chloe?

00:45.630 --> 00:46.700
Good.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.150
So anyway...

00:49.750 --> 00:51.160
You know, we should get together.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.330
Oh! yeah. yeah, sure.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.520
Whatever. yeah. it's casual.

00:56.190 --> 00:56.900
All right.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.310
All right. excuse me, ladies.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.470
Stop it. stop it. it's nothing. it's nothing.

01:03.810 --> 01:04.610
Girls?

01:05.950 --> 01:07.590
Shh! god!

01:19.360 --> 01:21.390
Mom, you got a package from the--

01:21.410 --> 01:22.500
Oh, is it here already?

01:22.690 --> 01:24.510
Oh, it's my natural face limited edition

01:24.510 --> 01:26.470
Deluxe 100-piece home makeup kit.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.750
I was afraid I'd missed out.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.310
They only make a million of these.

01:30.540 --> 01:31.850
Anyway, it's a good thing your dad's off

01:31.850 --> 01:34.660
At that poultry conference. it's the perfect time for us

01:34.660 --> 01:39.890
-To do...  makeovers. -mm! you know what?

01:39.890 --> 01:43.800
It's also the perfect time to not do makeovers.

01:43.890 --> 01:45.840
I mean, how often in history does th happen?

01:52.680 --> 01:53.430
Hello.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.000
Oh, hi, todd. how are you? 

01:56.100 --> 01:58.290
-Samantha? no, she's not home yet. -give it!

01:58.450 --> 02:00.980
-Do makeovers with me. -have you no pride?

02:01.290 --> 02:02.640
Would you like me to have her call you

02:02.650 --> 02:03.310
If I ever see her again?  

02:03.350 --> 02:05.310
okay, yes, yes, yes, tomorrow night, okay?

02:05.400 --> 02:06.820
Oh, wait. she just walked in.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.330
Hey, you.

02:11.530 --> 02:12.430
Listen, um,

02:12.440 --> 02:15.530
I made too much chili, and you used to love my chili.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.620
So if you're not doing anything tonight, I thought--

02:17.620 --> 02:18.840
Yeah! yeah.

02:19.510 --> 02:21.730
Hey, why do they call it "chili" when it's so hot?

02:22.250 --> 02:23.940
You know... what i... mean?

02:26.950 --> 02:29.510
Um, yeah, that would be--that would be great.

02:29.530 --> 02:30.640
I would love to eat your chili.

02:30.660 --> 02:32.160
I'll see you later. okay.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.950
Stop. he has a girlfriend.

02:38.140 --> 02:40.660
Really? then why isn't he making her dinner?

02:43.430 --> 02:44.960
Because he likes me.

02:47.510 --> 02:48.990
Oh, jeez. hello? hello? oh god 

02:56.320 --> 02:57.560
Yeah, so listen, um...

02:58.600 --> 03:01.660
You know, you and i--we've been getting along well lately.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.660
Yes, we have.

03:04.040 --> 03:08.090
-And then here I am, living at your place by myself. -I know.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.750
And there you are. you're living with your parents.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.420
It's crazy, right?

03:14.670 --> 03:15.370
Wait. are...

03:15.910 --> 03:16.870
Are you saying...

03:17.100 --> 03:20.270
Are--are you-- are you... asking...

03:20.840 --> 03:22.350
If chloe can move in with me.

03:24.820 --> 03:27.060
Chl--chloe! yeah!

03:27.160 --> 03:29.810
I mean, of course that's what you meant.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.000
-So you're okay with it? -are you kidding?

03:32.320 --> 03:34.310
Yeah. get that girl in here.

03:37.310 --> 03:38.010
Yeah.

03:38.130 --> 03:41.000
It is your apartment. why didn't you just tell him no?

03:41.050 --> 03:42.110
I did say no.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.450
It just happened to come out as, "get that girl in here."

03:45.700 --> 03:47.340
Ugh. what is wrong with me?

03:47.420 --> 03:50.890
What's wrong with you is you're a big ol' dumb blank slate.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.480
Please, ask me next time you wanna make

03:53.480 --> 03:54.900
Any more of these stupid moves.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.200
What do I do about todd?

03:56.290 --> 03:58.530
Todd is not the problem. chloe is.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.970
If you want him back, you have to get rid of her.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.360
Yeah, well, how could I do that?

04:02.510 --> 04:07.070
Wait. that came out wrong. how could I do that? 

04:07.070 --> 04:08.070
the same as you ways did.

04:08.070 --> 04:10.380
Whenever you wanted a guy, yohad, like, 50 different ways

04:10.380 --> 04:12.820
To make the girlfriend disappear--the one where

04:12.820 --> 04:15.000
You take a hotel matchbook and write your number on it

04:15.000 --> 04:17.209
And stick it in his pocket, 

04:17.209 --> 04:18.209
-the one with the... wine. -the wine.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.510
That's him.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.520
Samantha likey.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.220
Ahem. excuse me. hi.

04:29.340 --> 04:32.560
-Is that your boyfriend over there? -yes. why?

04:34.340 --> 04:37.530
Yeah, because he just sent over this bottle of wine

04:37.570 --> 04:38.960
To me and my friend.

04:39.350 --> 04:40.150
What?!

04:40.250 --> 04:42.980
I know, I know. oh, god, I hate to tell you this,

04:42.980 --> 04:44.760
But we're on the same team, right?

04:44.960 --> 04:47.500
I'm sorry. guys suck.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.080
Don't wait for me. I have a ride.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.390
Ooh, daddy!

04:59.820 --> 05:00.740
You're awesome.

05:01.420 --> 05:04.140
No! that is--you know what? that is awful. no.

05:04.180 --> 05:06.380
No, no, no. I'm just gonna leave them alone.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.830
Now with chloe living there, it'll be easy.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.380
No, this is good. this is good,

05:11.570 --> 05:14.230
Because want him or not, I'm gonna take the high road.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.270
Angelina?

05:16.670 --> 05:19.330
-Angelina? -hello, miss newly.

05:19.340 --> 05:22.150
Hi, audrey. um, she's from my apartment.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.020
She's the... board president.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.910
So I saw a young woman moving into your apartment last night.

05:27.030 --> 05:30.320
Really? wow. already, huh?

05:30.570 --> 05:34.130
Yeah, that's my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend.

05:34.180 --> 05:35.510
She's moving in with him...

05:35.630 --> 05:39.150
Which would bother most people, but not me. no.

05:39.150 --> 05:40.090
Well, it should,

05:40.120 --> 05:43.230
Because subletting is forbidden and grounds for eviction.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.420
Well, yeah.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.640
That is why I don't sublet. see ya.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.250
Hey, psst! I'll just call you.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.160
Say it. "andrea."

05:55.670 --> 05:56.970
Say it right.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.900
Hi. sorry to bother you guys.

06:03.270 --> 06:05.430
I just need to move in with you. okay?

06:06.130 --> 06:09.070
Room for me, right? unless you took all the drawers...

06:13.320 --> 06:14.250
Thanks again.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.930
I know that this is awkward for you guys.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.570
No, it's fine. I mean, it's just until you convince audrey rhodes

06:20.620 --> 06:22.590
-You're living here, right? -yeah. yeah.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.710
Of course, unless chloe wants to put on a blonde wig

06:25.890 --> 06:27.970
And walk around acting all forgetty.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.250
No. but it's fine. welcome to our home.

06:33.350 --> 06:35.420
Which I own, but...

06:35.670 --> 06:38.110
Ha! anyway, uh,

06:38.110 --> 06:41.430
Now I am going to-- I'm gonna buy marvin gardens.

06:44.210 --> 06:45.750
What? what is it?

06:45.750 --> 06:48.950
Nothing. nothing. it's, uh... inside joke.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.730
Marvin gardens!

06:55.160 --> 06:57.180
You know, i-i don't think I'm gonna buy it.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.030
Oh, no? well...

06:59.660 --> 07:03.180
Maybe mr. fuzzy will buy it.

07:03.470 --> 07:06.200
My buggy won him for me at a carnival.

07:06.420 --> 07:09.050
Your... buggy won you a fuzzy?

07:09.230 --> 07:10.860
Yeah. isn't he cute?

07:11.480 --> 07:13.650
Doesn't he look just like his daddy?

07:14.840 --> 07:16.830
Yeah, it's--it's weird. I don't see it.

07:17.060 --> 07:18.320
Looks just like you.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.040
You know, um, we're being bad hosts.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.790
We don't need to do this here. oh.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.170
It's okay. but thank you.

07:24.260 --> 07:25.900
Yeah. god. uhh!

07:27.000 --> 07:28.060
Let's go to bed.

07:29.790 --> 07:30.860
Yeah, that's better.

07:45.940 --> 07:46.710
Hello?

07:51.650 --> 07:52.360
Sam?

07:52.780 --> 07:53.800
She's not here.

07:56.470 --> 07:58.700
She's probably at a meeting of "daughters who refuse to do

07:58.700 --> 08:00.540
One thing to please their mothers" club.

08:00.830 --> 08:06.030
Oh, okay. well... maybe I'll go find her there.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.310
Dena?

08:12.900 --> 08:14.130
Your mother's dead.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.070
That's true.

08:16.150 --> 08:17.760
And my daughter's out gallivanting.

08:18.210 --> 08:20.280
You see how 're both suffering?

08:20.880 --> 08:22.650
Very similar, yeah.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.780
You were always like a second daughter to me.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.010
Have I ever told you that?

08:26.250 --> 08:27.730
You rarely speak to me.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.020
You were a very special little girl,

08:30.290 --> 08:32.679
And that wonder woman costume

08:32.679 --> 08:34.990
You wore throughout fifth grade proved it.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.659
You remember that costume?

08:36.820 --> 08:39.340
Ah! with the yellow wristband?

08:39.669 --> 08:41.760
You made me believe you could save the world.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.120
I thought I could.

08:44.210 --> 08:46.940
So... what kind of wine does wonder woman drink?

08:47.070 --> 08:48.820
Cabernet or tequila?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.380
There is just no way that I could have slept up there.

08:53.410 --> 08:55.200
I mean, I could deal with the marvin gaye,

08:55.280 --> 08:57.230
But then they start blasting "bolero"?

08:57.440 --> 08:59.410
Right. time to take this chick out.

09:00.420 --> 09:01.180
What's this?

09:01.280 --> 09:03.170
You're gonna plant these around the apartment,

09:03.310 --> 09:05.780
And todd's gonna kick this girl out in no time.

09:06.430 --> 09:09.580
Herpes cream--stick it in the medicine cabinet.

09:09.630 --> 09:13.180
Have an ovulation chart and an unopened ovulation kit.

09:13.290 --> 09:16.350
But--but, look, chloe hasn't done anything wrong, you know?

09:16.350 --> 09:18.550
And I'm not this person anymore, andrea.

09:18.550 --> 09:19.730
I'm not deceitful.

09:20.150 --> 09:21.640
Hello, ms. newly.

09:22.710 --> 09:23.670
Hi, audrey.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.350
Yeah. just, um...

09:25.550 --> 09:28.250
Sitting in front of my building... that I live in.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.630
A little deceitful. tiny bit.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.250
You have very steady hands.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.790
You could have been a doctor's assistant.

09:47.030 --> 09:49.050
Okay. ready?

09:49.160 --> 09:52.030
One... two... three.

09:55.110 --> 09:58.020
Oh. look at me.

09:58.820 --> 10:01.340
I haven't felt this pretty in a long time.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.880
You? you're the most beautiful woman in town.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.200
Everyone thinks so.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.100
Not everyone.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.860
Some people think I'm almost beautiful.

10:10.350 --> 10:11.130
No.

10:11.350 --> 10:14.120
Runner-up miss walnut valley beautiful.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.550
You lost a beauty pageant?

10:16.640 --> 10:18.960
Mm. to paula drake.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.690
That bitch.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.680
I never even got to give my acceptance speech.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.440
Speech. speech, speech, speech, speech!

10:28.850 --> 10:30.400
Oh, it was so long ago.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.300
I don't even think about it anymore.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.550
And to the new miss walnut valley.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.480
Thank you.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.770
Thank you for choosing me to represent you.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.970
And I promise to work tirelesslyo promote

10:44.310 --> 10:47.830
Peace between the peoples of vietnam and beauty and grooming

10:48.300 --> 10:49.550
Wherever I may walk.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.660
As your queen, I salute you.

10:52.430 --> 10:53.630
Oh, my god.

10:54.130 --> 10:55.980
I felt like you were speaking to me.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.010
Okay, now you.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.440
What?

11:03.010 --> 11:05.510
You have to tell a deep, dark secret, or it's not fair.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.520
-Oh! I don't know. -yes, you have to.

11:08.620 --> 11:09.910
Well, there's so many.

11:09.940 --> 11:13.000
Something fun, like a dream that was crushed.

11:14.580 --> 11:18.670
I've never told anyone I wanted to be an artist.

11:19.450 --> 11:21.880
I spent weeks in my room alone,

11:23.060 --> 11:24.560
Drawing that turtle.

11:24.610 --> 11:25.920
It was in the back of the magazine,

11:26.420 --> 11:28.020
And you'd submit it to an art school

11:28.600 --> 11:30.420
And see if you'd get accepted.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.600
Oh, honey, didn't you know that was a scam?

11:33.950 --> 11:36.470
They just wanted your money. they accepted everyone.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.050
Not everyone.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.750
I hate that art school for ruining your dream.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.660
I hate that paula drake for ruining your dream.

11:47.830 --> 11:51.060
You know what the worst part is? she lives two blocks away.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.720
Every time I wanna run out to the day-old bakery,

11:53.810 --> 11:55.020
I have to see her house

11:55.470 --> 11:58.470
And that ridiculous rabbit statue on her lawn,

11:58.470 --> 12:00.120
Like she's better than everyone else.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.550
Let's t.p. her house.

12:01.710 --> 12:03.260
Oh, please.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.530
-Yes! -you talked me into it.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.170
You're very persuasive.

12:09.780 --> 12:11.890
You could have been a lawyer's assistant.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.660
Samantha?

12:18.350 --> 12:20.770
Todd is mine.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.650
Go near him, and I'll destroy you.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.880
Good morning, sam. how'd you sleep?

12:50.990 --> 12:54.170
Good. yeah, I got a solid 15 minutes in.

12:54.290 --> 12:55.360
Oh, well, I hope you're hungry

12:55.370 --> 12:57.140
Cause I made some organic pecan pancakes and...

12:58.710 --> 13:00.060
Have some orange juice.

13:00.850 --> 13:02.030
I squeezed it myself.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.160
Have some. it's delicious.

13:07.590 --> 13:11.360
No, I will. I will. I'm just building up a thirst.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.400
Okay.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.920
Oh, mmm! that... really good orange juice.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.660
Chloe, um, sam and I need to talk.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.860
Could you just give us a second?

13:23.240 --> 13:24.630
Oh, yeah, sure.

13:30.910 --> 13:31.560
Todd--

13:31.610 --> 13:34.540
No, no, no. me first. I know what happened last night.

13:34.670 --> 13:37.070
You do? it's freaky, right?

13:37.140 --> 13:38.640
I mean, that girl is a whackadoo.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.800
-She is? -yeah.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.730
You're the one that snuck into our bedroom last night

13:41.730 --> 13:43.000
To say you were gonna take her down.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.260
You scared the crap out of her.

13:46.270 --> 13:47.900
I'm sorry. what?

13:57.170 --> 13:57.850
Oh, no.

14:10.190 --> 14:11.140
Oh, boy.

14:15.540 --> 14:16.190
So...

14:17.250 --> 14:18.100
So...

14:19.870 --> 14:20.550
Well...

14:23.230 --> 14:24.300
Okay, then,

14:25.180 --> 14:26.840
Thank you for a lovely--

14:26.870 --> 14:27.880
Please don't.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.580
I am telling you, todd, she threatened me, okay?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.960
I was asleep on the couch when I got a visit

14:34.960 --> 14:36.310
From the little freak fairy,

14:36.330 --> 14:38.460
And she told me that I had to staaway from you. 

14:38.460 --> 14:40.560
oh, just stop it, sam.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.050
I mean, you're so jealous,

14:42.050 --> 14:44.470
You can't see that chloe's a sweet, caring person.

14:44.600 --> 14:48.870
Ha ha ha ha! oh, boy. do you have a type.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.780
A type? what are you talking about? what type?

14:50.850 --> 14:53.380
I'm talking about that type-- a  me type,

14:53.460 --> 14:54.900
Because chloe is just like me.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.480
I mean, not me now, but me then. bad me.

14:58.990 --> 15:00.670
She is bad.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.470
She got up early to make you breakfast

15:02.510 --> 15:05.670
Because for some reason she still wants you to feel at home.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.740
Trust me, todd, if I was gonna go after chloe,

15:08.800 --> 15:10.730
She wouldn't even be able to make breakfast,

15:10.730 --> 15:12.270
Because all that would be left of her

15:12.270 --> 15:14.040
Would be a blubbering mess.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.630
Oh, my god!

15:16.590 --> 15:18.310
Look at what she did to my fuzzy!

15:18.410 --> 15:20.930
What? what? no, co--i have-- there is no ill will

15:20.930 --> 15:23.660
Between me and your... fuzzy. todd?

15:23.720 --> 15:25.680
Sam, I know you have to stay here,

15:25.700 --> 15:28.980
But just... keep out of our way, and we'll keep out of yours.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.760
-It's okay. i--we...  -he doesn't have a face!

15:31.810 --> 15:34.330
I know, sweetheart, but he'll have a face again.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.940
You're lucky you don't have eyes,

15:37.040 --> 15:40.220
Because it is gonna get ugly around here.

15:52.490 --> 15:54.090
I'll be ght back, todd.

15:54.190 --> 15:55.640
Don't get too clean.

15:59.200 --> 15:59.850
Chloe.

15:59.980 --> 16:00.980
What are you doing?

16:01.030 --> 16:02.490
Oh, god. I'm gonna be sick.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.140
I always hate these scenes.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.010
What have you done?

16:07.870 --> 16:09.910
It just happened. i...

16:09.950 --> 16:12.190
He was apologizing for how he talked to me,

16:12.220 --> 16:14.310
And then it just turned into something else.

16:14.670 --> 16:17.130
No, this can't be happening. todd--

16:17.220 --> 16:18.590
You just need to calm down before you do

16:18.610 --> 16:21.270
Something stupid, all right? don't blame yourself.

16:21.350 --> 16:22.810
You just stepped into a situation

16:22.880 --> 16:24.200
Where two people have something

16:24.260 --> 16:28.020
-That you just can't compete with. -why would he do this to me?

16:28.290 --> 16:30.000
Because you're the rebound girl.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.420
I mean, that never occurred to you?

16:33.980 --> 16:35.570
Why don't you just get outta here

16:35.710 --> 16:38.290
And go take a nice, long walk...

16:38.330 --> 16:40.370
To a friend's house or some-- todd!

16:42.140 --> 16:43.010
What's going on here?

16:43.250 --> 16:48.250
Hey, you took the hallway door from the shower. crafty.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.650
Oh, my god. u are such a liar!

16:50.750 --> 16:51.680
Me?

16:51.750 --> 16:53.600
Oh! no, no, no, girlie.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.710
You're the liar, because you're the one who attacked

16:55.750 --> 16:58.420
Your own fuzzy because you were insecure and afraid,

16:58.470 --> 16:59.990
Admit it. I'm right.

17:00.030 --> 17:02.390
Todd, she is completely insane.

17:02.410 --> 17:04.790
I don't even feel safe here with her.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.890
oh, yeah? what's that?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.660
-What? let go of me! -that's purple ink.

17:09.690 --> 17:12.390
That's what that is. that is the same color ink

17:12.480 --> 17:15.920
That we find on your... little... fuzzy!

17:22.670 --> 17:23.890
Chloe?

17:26.740 --> 17:28.020
All right, yeah, I did it.

17:28.860 --> 17:30.720
I just felt... threatened by her

17:30.740 --> 17:33.030
Because she's so beautiful and smart.

17:33.110 --> 17:34.720
Oh, that is so not true!

17:35.410 --> 17:37.790
Oh, wait. thank you.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.910
You mean so much to me, and having her around,

17:40.940 --> 17:42.350
I felt like I needed to compete,

17:43.020 --> 17:44.930
And... I can't compete.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.110
You know? so if this is what you want--

17:47.130 --> 17:49.400
Okay, you know what? there is no competition.

17:49.940 --> 17:53.450
Thank you! bah. game over. that's it.

17:53.650 --> 17:54.990
I love you.

17:55.270 --> 17:57.340
Yeah, that's right. let her down easy.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.350
You know, soft--soften the blow.

18:00.590 --> 18:02.590
Okay, that's soft enough.

18:02.740 --> 18:05.450
Sam? just give us a minute.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.580
I found an ovulation kit in the trash!

18:09.640 --> 18:10.980
Sam, that's enough!

18:11.740 --> 18:15.790
Fine. fine, you love her. that's great.

18:16.420 --> 18:17.530
You know what I love?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.610
I love getting the hell out of here.

18:19.670 --> 18:21.820
That's what I love, and I love it so much,

18:21.890 --> 18:25.360
That I'm just gonna keep doing it over and over again,

18:25.510 --> 18:26.720
Starting now!

18:33.610 --> 18:35.030
Oh, crap!

18:39.300 --> 18:40.210
Todd?

18:41.580 --> 18:42.520
Guys?

18:46.190 --> 18:48.710
Marvin gardens!

18:50.700 --> 18:51.750
Please?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.560
Stupid, stupid, stupid...

19:01.970 --> 19:03.570
Andrea's bringing me something to wear.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.170
But thank you for the coat.

19:05.530 --> 19:07.370
I'm sorry if it smells like perfume.

19:08.020 --> 19:10.210
Hey, you know, I could write a note to your wife and tell her

19:10.210 --> 19:11.400
That we didn't have sex.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.010
Oh, yes. thank you. I think she'd like that.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.760
Nice little place you got down here.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.540
A little tv.

19:23.020 --> 19:26.270
You know, there aren't enough interracial couples on tv.

19:26.850 --> 19:28.230
What show is this?

19:28.330 --> 19:30.870
That's us on the security camera.

19:38.050 --> 19:39.950
How do you not do this all day?

19:41.370 --> 19:43.180
You know what? go home.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.400
I'll cover for you with audrey rhodes.

19:45.490 --> 19:47.730
Really? you would do that for me?

19:47.780 --> 19:51.530
Not for you, no, but because that chloe girl is an evil rag.

19:51.570 --> 19:53.850
So you believe me? you agree she's bad.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.830
I don't think either one of you is any prize,

19:56.120 --> 19:58.160
But I can only handle one rag at a time.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.370
Thank you, frank.

20:01.530 --> 20:02.260
Nope.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.550
I wouldn't do that.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.410
Ok, class, a quick review.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.750
Muscle memory.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.000
Very helpful in remembering things you forgot.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.420
But here is a thing.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.590
The heart is also a muscle

20:15.980 --> 20:16.660
Fortunately.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.300
The heart remembers most strongly

20:18.300 --> 20:20.300
the people who always love you.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.440
No matter what.

20:26.710 --> 20:28.010
Where did the turtle come from?

20:28.660 --> 20:30.700
Um...I don't know.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.530
Todd chose someone else.

20:38.580 --> 20:42.540
Honey, I'm sorry.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.630
I know I have amnesia but I

20:49.970 --> 20:53.890
really don't recall that rabbit thing right there.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.800
That?

20:57.560 --> 20:58.900
It's always been there.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.250
Now help me bury it in the backyard.

21:04.250 --> 21:05.970
Please.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.110
Samantha.
