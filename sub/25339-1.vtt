01:33.975 --> 01:34.975
<i>Talk.</i>

01:35.176 --> 01:36.176
<i>Talk.</i>

01:39.414 --> 01:40.574
For the last time,

01:41.928 --> 01:44.829
release Abdel Salman Al-Arkan
from his prison in Paris.

01:46.115 --> 01:49.949
This is Lucas Graves, IDP News,
signing off.

01:50.961 --> 01:53.575
Please. They're gonna kill us all!

02:00.535 --> 02:04.733
Release him, or the execution plays live
in 45 minutes.

02:11.044 --> 02:12.342
They're gonna kill us.

02:15.783 --> 02:16.875
Stay strong.

02:22.023 --> 02:23.888
Destination confirmed.

02:25.092 --> 02:27.185
<i>You should kill them.</i>

02:28.629 --> 02:32.292
<i>A powerful statement, a
Westerner killing his own people.</i>

02:38.639 --> 02:40.732
Recalculating route.

02:47.381 --> 02:49.440
<i>They should have called.</i>

02:50.918 --> 02:52.787
<i>They should have called already!</i>

03:11.806 --> 03:13.637
No. No. No, please!

03:25.253 --> 03:26.253
Please don't kill me!

04:09.063 --> 04:10.063
Go. Go!

04:12.033 --> 04:13.523
Come on. Move. Go!

04:16.303 --> 04:18.863
<i>They're getting away! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

04:26.547 --> 04:27.673
Go.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.999
<i>I'll take the north side.</i>

04:47.368 --> 04:48.392
<i>OK!</i>

05:28.409 --> 05:29.876
<i>Keep searching the southside.</i>

05:30.111 --> 05:31.544
<i>Lock down the perimeter.</i>

05:42.790 --> 05:45.088
Shit. He's not here.

06:02.076 --> 06:03.771
Get them on the truck now.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.013
Let's go! Let's go!

06:14.622 --> 06:16.954
Kimbral's not here. He's got the keys.

06:25.433 --> 06:26.491
Come on!

06:31.472 --> 06:32.530
What the fuck was that?

06:33.708 --> 06:34.766
We got to go, Shu.

06:34.842 --> 06:36.139
Come on, come on, come on.

06:38.379 --> 06:40.176
Where the hell's Kimbral?

06:45.386 --> 06:47.684
You are 40 seconds late, Kimbral.

06:51.192 --> 06:52.192
Go, go!

06:52.993 --> 06:53.993
Where the hell were you?

07:10.478 --> 07:13.140
- She's been shot.
- Give me room. Give me room!

07:14.415 --> 07:16.406
Alice. Alice!

07:18.152 --> 07:19.210
Come on.

07:22.223 --> 07:23.223
Damn it.

07:29.730 --> 07:30.730
Abby!

07:31.365 --> 07:33.663
Move, move, move, move, move.
What happened?

07:34.101 --> 07:35.329
She's shot in the chest.

07:36.003 --> 07:37.868
What the hell took you guys so long?

07:38.272 --> 07:40.001
Shit. Fuck.

07:41.108 --> 07:42.108
Okay.

07:44.779 --> 07:45.779
Oh, God.

07:50.351 --> 07:51.579
She's gone.

07:52.086 --> 07:53.086
Shit.

07:54.355 --> 07:55.379
This is on you.

07:57.424 --> 07:58.516
What the hell happened?

08:03.397 --> 08:04.397
Goddamn it.

08:11.438 --> 08:12.803
What happened?

08:19.747 --> 08:22.545
I had a chance to blow their weapons load,
and I took it.

08:22.616 --> 08:25.278
- It wasn't part of the fucking plan!
- I factored it in.

08:25.386 --> 08:27.278
- Oh, you factored it in?
- The route I took, the speed...

08:27.288 --> 08:30.553
- Where were you?
- Did you use your computer program?

08:31.592 --> 08:33.991
Shu, there was less than point zero zero...

08:34.962 --> 08:37.726
Shu, the algorithm was solid.

08:49.977 --> 08:51.103
You lost a hostage?

08:51.745 --> 08:53.406
Bossman's gonna be pissed.

08:56.584 --> 08:58.347
Get us the fuck out of here, Hush.

09:29.383 --> 09:32.147
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Come on in and sit down.

09:40.728 --> 09:41.888
I'm letting you go.

09:43.230 --> 09:44.720
- What?
- I'm letting you go.

09:45.799 --> 09:47.824
I won't be needing your services anymore.

09:50.537 --> 09:52.630
You know,
the most important thing in this job

09:52.706 --> 09:54.469
is knowing you can trust the guy
next to you.

09:56.176 --> 10:00.044
I told you before.
This program of yours, it wasn't ready,

10:00.147 --> 10:01.978
and you defied the team.

10:02.049 --> 10:04.210
My program's not ready,
or you just don't like it?

10:05.085 --> 10:06.085
A woman died.

10:06.153 --> 10:09.145
Could've happened without the algorithm.
Don't you put that on me.

10:09.223 --> 10:11.748
You want to make all these excuses up
in your head: Algorithm.

10:11.859 --> 10:13.690
Whatever it is, someone died

10:13.761 --> 10:16.662
because you trusted a computer
more than your own team.

10:16.730 --> 10:17.730
You got to go.

10:32.713 --> 10:33.941
Told you we expanded too fast.

10:34.048 --> 10:36.329
You gonna sit there and bust my balls
or get back to work?

10:38.085 --> 10:40.519
Next time, I'll listen to you... maybe.

10:47.728 --> 10:50.128
How do you say, quote, "I am stupid"?

10:51.699 --> 10:54.190
<i>I'm stupid...</i>

10:54.768 --> 10:56.429
Why do you want to learn Qingdao?

10:57.404 --> 11:00.703
It's almost impossible
for a Western ear to decipher.

11:00.774 --> 11:01.774
I like the impossible.

11:03.477 --> 11:06.412
This game, Go, is interesting.

11:06.814 --> 11:08.406
Why do you think you win all the time?

11:09.583 --> 11:11.813
Because I've been playing Go
since I was four,

11:12.586 --> 11:14.884
and you started two years ago.

11:15.622 --> 11:17.146
You move everything together.

11:17.925 --> 11:20.086
You take the territory as one.

11:20.160 --> 11:24.256
You take my pieces as one.
Everything flows as one.

11:25.099 --> 11:28.626
When you were at the factory,
none of your guys moved together.

11:28.736 --> 11:30.328
You didn't flow as one.

11:30.437 --> 11:32.234
Kimbral was trying to upstage you.

11:34.174 --> 11:35.402
Maybe I should work alone.

11:37.244 --> 11:38.438
No one does it alone.

11:39.413 --> 11:43.349
I guess that's why I hear your voice
in my head when I am on the job.

11:43.984 --> 11:47.317
It may sound like me,
but I think that voice is your intuition.

11:48.689 --> 11:50.782
Take all the time you need,

11:50.858 --> 11:54.259
but when you come back,
I need you to be a team player.

11:57.631 --> 11:58.757
Don't be like Kimbral.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.864
Don't confuse intuition with ego.

12:02.870 --> 12:07.102
Trust me on this one, Shu.
Always listen to your intuition.

12:07.841 --> 12:08.865
Always.

12:23.457 --> 12:25.857
The original communication satellite

12:25.959 --> 12:28.860
set out to solve one problem...

12:29.897 --> 12:33.993
how to send a signal successfully
around the bend in the Earth

12:34.501 --> 12:36.128
and reach the receiver.

12:36.203 --> 12:40.230
Today, we at Yusheng Technology
are proud to present to you

12:40.340 --> 12:42.535
the future of satellite tech.

12:42.643 --> 12:44.975
We do it faster, with smaller units...

12:45.045 --> 12:47.536
Now this is where the graphics
are gonna change?

12:47.648 --> 12:50.208
<i>I don't need graphics!</i>

12:50.317 --> 12:52.251
<i>This isn't Cirque de Soleil.</i>

12:52.352 --> 12:55.219
<i>Maybe a tiger can jump out when
I get to the cubesats.</i>

12:55.355 --> 12:56.515
Chin!

12:56.590 --> 12:57.716
<i>A little help here please.</i>

12:58.225 --> 13:00.989
What? I like tigers.

13:02.029 --> 13:05.055
Okay, everyone,
let's reset and go again in five.

13:07.201 --> 13:08.259
- Yusheng?
- Huh?

13:11.772 --> 13:13.899
Don't worry, little bro. You'll be great.

13:16.076 --> 13:17.076
Thank you.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.517
I didn't expect to see you here.

13:34.628 --> 13:36.596
Your job keeps you busier than I am.

13:37.865 --> 13:40.891
Who knew being a security specialist
was so time-consuming?

13:40.968 --> 13:42.868
I have a job next week in Macao.

13:42.936 --> 13:44.460
So you were in the neighborhood.

13:52.246 --> 13:53.645
It's great to see you, Chin.

13:53.747 --> 13:56.238
I wish I could say
the same thing about your brother.

13:56.817 --> 13:58.284
What can I help you with?

13:58.785 --> 14:00.252
Yusheng is in trouble.

14:00.888 --> 14:03.254
Genius or not, he's careless.

14:03.323 --> 14:05.553
- Lot of people want to see him die.
- Who?

14:05.626 --> 14:08.754
A company called Ruscho
is who I'm most worried about.

14:08.829 --> 14:10.990
They're a tech giant
headquartered in Geneva,

14:11.098 --> 14:14.727
and they tried to buy Yusheng out
three times already, and he's refused.

14:15.335 --> 14:18.304
These are not the kind of guys
who take no for an answer.

14:18.805 --> 14:21.603
He's going to Bangkok this weekend
for a bachelor party,

14:22.342 --> 14:23.900
and he won't take a bodyguard.

14:28.482 --> 14:29.506
I'll pay you.

14:34.788 --> 14:37.951
We are family. Not necessary.

14:56.710 --> 14:59.679
<i>Party's over. Let's go. It's not safe here.</i>

15:00.314 --> 15:01.941
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

15:02.482 --> 15:03.676
<i>OK, cousin.</i>

15:04.184 --> 15:05.208
<i>I'm taking you home.</i>

16:31.471 --> 16:35.271
I am Galileo. You are inmate 1764.

16:36.143 --> 16:39.271
I repeat, you are inmate 1764.

16:40.247 --> 16:41.441
Welcome to Hades.

17:15.015 --> 17:17.449
Attention, inmate 1764.

17:17.517 --> 17:19.416
You have been reported to battle
in the zoo.

17:27.294 --> 17:28.352
Begin battle.

18:01.828 --> 18:03.125
The battle is over.

18:04.498 --> 18:09.197
Inmate 1764, you have earned
two hours of sanctuary time.

18:10.203 --> 18:13.195
All remaining inmates
return to your spoke.

18:13.306 --> 18:14.466
You okay?

18:15.075 --> 18:17.236
All prisoners return to your spoke.

18:27.154 --> 18:29.145
There must be someone we could talk to...

18:30.690 --> 18:33.250
to get us out of here.
I didn't do anything wrong.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.725
I didn't do anything wrong.

18:46.273 --> 18:49.572
Inmate 1764, report to the sanctuary.

18:52.245 --> 18:53.576
What is this?

18:55.382 --> 18:56.747
Must be where the winners go.

19:36.890 --> 19:38.790
Shu's gone. This is legit.
What do you got?

19:39.759 --> 19:43.160
His cousin says she's been
trying them both for 18 hours. No luck.

19:43.263 --> 19:45.925
- Party happened Saturday night.
- What'd you get from the party?

19:45.999 --> 19:47.591
No security tapes, nothing.

19:47.667 --> 19:48.895
All right, I'll look into it.

19:51.805 --> 19:53.796
All prisoners return to your spoke.

19:55.108 --> 19:57.235
All prisoners return to your spoke.

20:19.799 --> 20:22.825
The first thing they try to do in lockup
is break your spirit.

20:25.272 --> 20:28.332
Can't allow that to happen.
You have to stay mentally strong.

20:30.677 --> 20:34.613
You have to focus on three key things
to a successful breakout.

20:34.681 --> 20:35.875
What are they?

20:36.883 --> 20:38.851
One, know the layout.

20:40.220 --> 20:42.711
Two, understand the routine.

20:43.857 --> 20:47.623
Three, have help from the inside or out.

20:47.694 --> 20:50.959
Teamwork. Exactly.
Your favorite one, I can tell.

20:51.665 --> 20:56.364
Remember, Shu, you move together.
Everything flows as one.

21:35.742 --> 21:37.835
One, seven, six, four.

21:44.401 --> 21:45.838
Are you the warden?

21:47.045 --> 21:49.104
Your cousin is a brilliant man.

21:49.648 --> 21:54.950
He gave me the details of his patent,
number 34ACJL.

21:54.961 --> 21:59.728
But not number 36BBBCK.

22:00.300 --> 22:03.929
I need you to convince him
to give that to me.

22:06.272 --> 22:07.739
Why would I do that?

22:09.047 --> 22:10.241
You grew up together.

22:11.386 --> 22:12.819
Like brothers.

22:13.013 --> 22:14.640
But you weren't brothers.

22:15.416 --> 22:17.714
A family tragedy forced you
to live with him.

22:18.251 --> 22:19.650
You hated Yusheng.

22:19.986 --> 22:22.454
How he was always smarter
than everyone else.

22:22.555 --> 22:25.888
He could've helped a lot of people,
but he went for himself instead,

22:25.959 --> 22:26.983
and he got rich.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.651
And now, his love of money...

22:30.915 --> 22:32.246
his precious patent...

22:33.312 --> 22:35.007
is going to get you killed.

22:38.405 --> 22:41.670
I know everything about my animals.

22:43.330 --> 22:44.695
You want to know who I am?

22:46.398 --> 22:47.660
I'm the zookeeper.

22:50.483 --> 22:52.678
All prisoners report to the zoo.

22:53.486 --> 22:56.421
- All prisoners report to the zoo.
- What did you tell him?

22:57.357 --> 22:58.357
What?

22:58.758 --> 23:00.692
You gave up the first patent.

23:00.794 --> 23:03.456
So? They were torturing me.
That one's nothing.

23:04.097 --> 23:07.328
- He knew things about our background.
- I didn't tell him.

23:11.471 --> 23:13.769
The second patent, what is it?

23:16.976 --> 23:20.673
Advanced cube satellite tech.
It's a game changer.

23:20.780 --> 23:24.113
It can override and control
any computer system in the world.

23:24.184 --> 23:27.119
Like a cyber skeleton key.
And it's not what you think.

23:27.187 --> 23:30.486
This isn't about money.
I patented it so I could bury it.

23:30.557 --> 23:32.548
In the wrong hands, game over.

23:32.659 --> 23:35.992
Defense systems, nuclear codes.
No one will be safe.

23:48.374 --> 23:49.374
Kimbral.

23:56.850 --> 23:59.819
No, no. Not every day is a fight day.

24:05.859 --> 24:07.383
What are we doing here?

24:09.262 --> 24:10.923
I'm his cousin.

24:13.933 --> 24:16.093
I don't think it's a coincidence
that we both are here.

24:16.903 --> 24:18.393
I think they're after Breslin.

24:18.505 --> 24:20.096
You know, after spending
a lot of time with this,

24:20.106 --> 24:21.164
I put my ear to the ground,

24:21.174 --> 24:23.404
I just didn't like what I saw,
didn't like what I heard.

24:23.510 --> 24:24.909
How long have you been here?

24:25.512 --> 24:26.570
It's hard to say.

24:27.213 --> 24:30.376
My best guess is... couple of months.

24:31.117 --> 24:32.948
What is this place?

24:33.052 --> 24:34.883
There's a lot of rumors, like mythology.

24:34.954 --> 24:36.714
It's called
the High Asset Detention Service.

24:37.223 --> 24:38.223
Hades.

24:38.892 --> 24:39.950
Greek mythology?

24:40.460 --> 24:42.052
Land of the dead.

24:42.128 --> 24:44.254
Whoever goes in just doesn't come out.
It's that simple.

24:44.264 --> 24:46.232
- Sounds familiar.
- Yeah.

24:46.299 --> 24:50.201
The word is the people behind the Tomb
took a beating, did some adjustments,

24:50.270 --> 24:52.390
- and then came back strong.
- Who are these assholes?

24:52.972 --> 24:56.931
Spies, criminals,
businessmen, elected officials.

24:57.043 --> 24:58.043
Profit. Big profit.

24:58.478 --> 24:59.602
What makes you think he's there?

24:59.612 --> 25:04.709
His cousin Yusheng was put on
some kind of hit list by his competition,

25:05.151 --> 25:07.483
a satellite tech company called Ruscho.

25:08.087 --> 25:10.078
There's battle days
and there's truce days.

25:10.390 --> 25:12.290
If you win a battle, you get benefits.

25:12.766 --> 25:14.859
If you lose or refuse to fight...

25:16.162 --> 25:18.062
your time in here is very uncomfortable.

25:18.598 --> 25:21.795
That's why they call it "the zoo."
We're all animals here.

25:21.901 --> 25:23.163
Survival of the fittest.

25:23.269 --> 25:26.796
If you want someone to disappear so bad,
why not just kill them?

25:26.906 --> 25:29.272
Because then the world
will know they are dead.

25:30.233 --> 25:32.997
Here, they are just gone.

25:33.580 --> 25:36.014
Then we got to go in, get them out.

25:36.115 --> 25:37.841
Can't go in there blind.
We don't know a layout.

25:37.851 --> 25:40.285
- We don't have anything.
- You broke the Tomb totally blind.

25:40.353 --> 25:41.353
Yeah, well, I got lucky.

25:41.454 --> 25:43.134
We don't even know for sure
if Shu's there.

25:43.156 --> 25:45.281
- And what if he is?
- Look, if he's there, we'll get him.

25:45.291 --> 25:47.418
We go in there blind,
we get trapped ourselves.

25:48.094 --> 25:49.459
You don't think I can handle it.

25:50.029 --> 25:51.997
This is bigger than any one of us.

25:54.133 --> 25:55.133
All right.

26:08.147 --> 26:11.139
Sir, we've got a data breach.
Someone's in our system.

26:11.684 --> 26:14.209
What? Shut it down. Shut it down now.

26:27.166 --> 26:29.225
- Uh-huh.
- Just cleaning up for the night.

26:29.335 --> 26:30.335
Uh-huh.

26:31.638 --> 26:33.469
Here's the only contact I got at Ruscho.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.280
Not sure if he'll talk to you,
but it's a good place to start.

26:37.010 --> 26:38.034
A sticky note?

26:45.251 --> 26:47.845
- So what do you got?
- All right.

26:48.171 --> 26:51.163
Two things. A dark bank account,
code-named Sparrow,

26:51.230 --> 26:52.822
Ruscho's been sending money to.

26:53.026 --> 26:55.256
And they also sent ten million
to Leon Grassi,

26:55.361 --> 26:57.261
a lobbyist
for the private prison industry.

26:58.097 --> 26:59.689
I know this Leon Grassi.

27:00.566 --> 27:03.694
He used to work for the prison board
for about 13 years,

27:03.770 --> 27:05.261
and then he started taking a lot of heat

27:05.271 --> 27:07.171
every time I broke out
of one of his places,

27:07.240 --> 27:10.107
so he decided to jump into
the private sector.

27:10.209 --> 27:11.369
Haven't heard from him since.

27:11.444 --> 27:13.275
You look very nice today,
but you know that.

27:34.930 --> 27:35.954
Get you a drink?

27:36.731 --> 27:38.130
Not what you got, Tiny.

27:38.304 --> 27:41.137
I know you didn't go straight
and get an honest job pouring drinks,

27:41.240 --> 27:44.368
so tell me, DeRosa,
what are you doing here?

27:44.444 --> 27:46.036
Could easily ask you the same question.

27:46.112 --> 27:47.579
Yeah, well, that's personal.

27:49.983 --> 27:53.264
Got a call from Abigail,
this being the first time

27:53.319 --> 27:56.288
you're back in the field
after being a desk jockey for so long.

27:57.865 --> 27:59.526
She thought you might be a little rusty.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.502
Oh, that hurts.

28:04.097 --> 28:05.121
He's here.

28:06.332 --> 28:09.597
- Know that guy as well?
- You mean the wannabe gangster? No.

28:09.669 --> 28:10.795
You recognize him?

28:12.405 --> 28:13.667
Want me to introduce you?

28:14.841 --> 28:17.071
Since when are you so tight with Abigail?

28:17.143 --> 28:19.509
Like you said, it's personal.

28:20.580 --> 28:21.638
How you doing, Leon?

28:22.782 --> 28:23.782
Leon.

28:25.351 --> 28:26.943
You know, one of my men is missing,

28:27.020 --> 28:29.989
and I think he's in
a black-site prison called Hades.

28:30.089 --> 28:31.420
Ring a bell anywhere?

28:32.125 --> 28:36.186
And there's this company called Ruscho.
European satellite tech company.

28:36.295 --> 28:40.095
They gave you about ten million bucks.
How about that?

28:40.166 --> 28:41.531
Ten million dollars.

28:41.868 --> 28:44.359
Lot of money.
But I think it's all bullshit.

28:44.871 --> 28:46.805
Because you don't lobby
for satellite tech.

28:46.873 --> 28:47.703
Look, Ray...

28:47.807 --> 28:50.469
You lobby for black-site prison profit,
am I right?

28:50.543 --> 28:53.376
- Look, Ray...
- You're gonna tell me what you know.

29:14.367 --> 29:15.367
Move!

29:24.544 --> 29:26.307
Hey, Breslin...

29:28.214 --> 29:29.408
Good to be back?

29:30.249 --> 29:31.978
No, it's bad to be back.

29:34.921 --> 29:37.515
- Leon, who you working for?
- I'm sorry, Ray. I can't...

29:43.162 --> 29:45.357
Come on. Want a job, DeRosa?

29:46.332 --> 29:47.332
Fuck, yeah.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.597
There's this private bank account,
and I need it identified.

29:50.703 --> 29:53.228
With him dead, it's our only lead.

29:53.739 --> 29:56.503
All right.
Give me a day, I'll figure it out.

30:31.944 --> 30:32.944
Hey.

30:34.447 --> 30:36.039
Where are you coming from?

30:36.115 --> 30:39.035
I work for the prison. I'm the cook.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.638
Tell me about the kitchen.

30:43.422 --> 30:44.422
What do you mean?

30:44.490 --> 30:46.390
How do I get there from your cell?

30:47.627 --> 30:48.627
I got to go.

30:56.402 --> 30:57.426
Yes.

31:04.076 --> 31:06.408
You are on the wrong side
of the zoo, my friend.

31:06.479 --> 31:09.107
- I need you to kick my ass.
- What? It's a truce day.

31:26.499 --> 31:27.499
Come on.

32:36.235 --> 32:37.600
What the hell are you up to?

32:39.872 --> 32:42.500
Thought I could work the doctor,
get us some benefits.

32:43.509 --> 32:46.740
Turns out the doctor is a lamp stand.

32:48.748 --> 32:50.181
My name is Akala.

32:50.249 --> 32:51.249
Shu.

33:02.595 --> 33:04.529
- What?
- He connected the dots.

33:04.597 --> 33:06.758
Your inside man at Ruscho
sent me down a rabbit hole.

33:09.468 --> 33:12.528
But it looks like I found a guy
who can lead us to Shu.

33:12.605 --> 33:13.765
Where is this guy?

33:14.607 --> 33:16.700
Right now? Driving the car I'm chasing.

33:18.744 --> 33:20.234
Sure hope you know what you're doing.

33:20.913 --> 33:22.107
Call you back.

34:04.990 --> 34:06.014
Where you hiding?

34:24.310 --> 34:25.310
Damn it!

34:30.315 --> 34:31.476
Fuck me.

34:32.485 --> 34:37.513
Inmates 1764 and 1765, report to the zoo.

34:37.623 --> 34:39.853
I repeat, report to the zoo.

34:41.994 --> 34:43.893
They tortured me again last night.

34:51.003 --> 34:54.063
You were always
mentally tougher than me as a kid.

34:54.172 --> 34:55.400
Remember?

34:56.375 --> 34:58.400
You need to be now.

35:46.091 --> 35:47.251
Begin battle.

35:54.233 --> 35:55.393
Battle is over.

35:55.468 --> 36:01.236
Inmates 1764, 1765, you've earned
two hours of sanctuary time.

36:04.376 --> 36:06.241
Negative skeleton theory.

36:06.912 --> 36:10.404
Use what they let you see
to map out what you can't see.

36:12.318 --> 36:15.446
That's how the layout begins
to reveal itself to you.

36:23.162 --> 36:27.258
Train your mind to look beyond
the physical wall that confines you.

36:38.310 --> 36:41.746
There's a whole separate world
on the other side of the cells.

36:42.615 --> 36:47.484
Hallways, interrogation,
infirmary, kitchen, HQ.

36:48.420 --> 36:51.116
Right now, it's all negative space.

36:52.525 --> 36:54.083
But not for long.

36:56.962 --> 36:58.623
I'm gonna get us out of here.

37:07.473 --> 37:08.633
Fuck.

37:08.707 --> 37:10.470
Come on, Luke. Where are you?

37:11.377 --> 37:13.811
This is the last number
Luke called on his cell.

37:17.616 --> 37:18.776
Ruscho Geneva?

37:19.718 --> 37:21.208
Should I get Hush in here?

37:24.690 --> 37:25.782
No.

37:27.993 --> 37:29.460
You know, someone once told me...

37:30.963 --> 37:33.557
the single most important thing
to remember

37:33.666 --> 37:36.066
in solving the hardest riddles

37:36.635 --> 37:38.155
is that they're designed to trick you.

37:38.971 --> 37:40.495
Subvert against your own assumptions.

37:41.907 --> 37:45.172
And my assumptions are telling me
that there's no way

37:45.244 --> 37:47.974
that you would let Luke
go directly against company order.

37:48.747 --> 37:51.238
Look, he just wanted to do the legwork.

37:51.350 --> 37:53.990
Thought it was a good chance for him
to take the lead on something.

37:54.253 --> 37:56.016
And now Luke and Shu are missing.

38:01.527 --> 38:07.227
You are prisoner 1924.
I repeat, you are prisoner 1924.

38:07.333 --> 38:08.698
Welcome to Hades.

38:22.781 --> 38:25.443
Sir, I felt something was going on.
I hacked into the system,

38:25.551 --> 38:27.951
and basically, Luke tried to meet up
with Ruscho Geneva.

38:29.054 --> 38:30.054
Are you serious?

38:30.122 --> 38:33.002
I told him to stay away from these guys.
How'd he get involved with that?

38:34.560 --> 38:37.688
It was me. I gave him one of my contacts.

38:41.533 --> 38:42.533
Come on.

38:51.910 --> 38:54.242
After you went missing,
Breslin started digging.

38:54.313 --> 38:57.282
He thinks this place was started
by the same people behind the Tomb,

38:57.750 --> 38:58.750
so I...

39:01.253 --> 39:04.416
I screwed up. Ended up in here.

39:04.490 --> 39:08.051
Doesn't matter.
I'm close to getting the layout.

39:09.662 --> 39:11.994
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing yet.

39:12.097 --> 39:15.089
The less contact we have, the better.

39:17.069 --> 39:19.629
Shu, it can't be a coincidence

39:19.738 --> 39:22.673
that all three of Breslin's specialists
are locked up here now.

39:22.775 --> 39:24.174
No, it can't.

39:25.177 --> 39:26.667
Assume they are watching us.

39:43.962 --> 39:45.122
Please.

39:46.031 --> 39:48.022
He's close to giving it to you.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.794
Close?

39:50.536 --> 39:51.696
He won't last.

39:51.804 --> 39:53.704
Then he needs to give me what I want.

39:55.207 --> 39:57.038
Or I'll feed him
to the rest of the animals.

40:10.489 --> 40:13.481
I've tried to make soup dumplings
since I was a kid,

40:13.559 --> 40:16.790
but every time, the dough is too stiff.

40:19.665 --> 40:22.634
Look, I don't know what your deal is,

40:23.335 --> 40:26.304
but... I don't want to die.

40:26.371 --> 40:28.362
What they are doing to you is wrong.

40:32.044 --> 40:33.568
Then let me help you get home.

40:37.883 --> 40:40.750
They blindfold me
when I go from my cell to the kitchen.

40:43.155 --> 40:45.180
That's not the only way to see.

40:46.692 --> 40:51.254
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20...

40:51.697 --> 40:52.994
How many steps?

40:53.766 --> 40:54.858
Twenty-four.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.062
The one gift
every prison gives you is time.

40:58.170 --> 40:59.535
Don't waste it.

40:59.605 --> 41:01.937
Visualize the layout
every chance you have.

41:06.178 --> 41:07.543
It was 45 this morning.

41:08.347 --> 41:09.541
What?

41:09.615 --> 41:11.173
Steps to the kitchen.

41:11.250 --> 41:12.581
The distance doubled?

41:17.189 --> 41:18.189
Come on!

41:29.601 --> 41:31.626
I need to get in the sanctuary.

41:31.737 --> 41:33.398
Yeah, and I need a Coke.

41:33.472 --> 41:34.632
Sweet dreams.

41:47.386 --> 41:49.479
All prisoners return to your spoke.

41:50.322 --> 41:54.122
I repeat,
all prisoners return to your spoke.

42:42.841 --> 42:46.834
Even the most complex of narratives
are often based on one simple idea.

42:48.380 --> 42:50.473
The answer is most likely
right in front of you.

42:57.456 --> 42:58.684
The prison is moving.

42:59.391 --> 43:02.724
The cell spokes
change entry points to the zoo.

43:02.828 --> 43:03.954
Like a Rubik's Cube?

43:04.630 --> 43:08.122
We got no routine. We got no layout.

43:08.667 --> 43:10.157
And we have no help.

43:10.836 --> 43:11.962
Maybe we do.

43:17.042 --> 43:18.236
Neo-Nazis?

43:18.343 --> 43:21.312
Computer nerds.
They brought them in some time back.

43:22.314 --> 43:25.010
They rounded them up
in some random basement in Iceland.

43:25.584 --> 43:27.575
The call themselves The Legion.

43:29.221 --> 43:31.155
The leader's handle is Count Zero.

43:32.391 --> 43:34.655
He's screwed with
more Fortune 500 companies

43:34.726 --> 43:36.216
than you and I can name.

43:36.328 --> 43:38.023
But our zookeeper's got a problem

43:38.096 --> 43:40.394
'cause he doesn't know
which one is actually Count Zero.

43:41.033 --> 43:43.194
He's interrogated them day and night.

43:44.202 --> 43:46.670
No sanctuary time ever.

43:47.406 --> 43:49.101
Why does the prison care?

43:50.208 --> 43:53.700
Because Count Zero
has acquired the specs to the prison.

43:54.513 --> 43:57.778
They need to know who he is
and where his servers are.

43:57.883 --> 43:59.544
- Specs of the prison?
- Yes.

44:00.018 --> 44:02.953
If you can find out which one
is Count Zero before the prison...

44:04.122 --> 44:05.521
maybe he can help us.

44:34.419 --> 44:35.579
I need to see Bug.

44:45.397 --> 44:47.627
I need to see... Bug.

44:48.166 --> 44:50.327
If you want a book on insects,
they're upstairs.

44:57.342 --> 44:59.173
Okay. Right this way.

45:37.783 --> 45:38.783
Bug.

45:44.656 --> 45:45.656
DeRosa?

45:47.526 --> 45:48.526
Sparrow.

45:50.295 --> 45:53.025
- Who is he?
- Come on. I can't give that to you.

45:53.131 --> 45:55.065
The Insect Society

45:55.167 --> 45:57.465
- clients remain anonymous.
- Clients remain anonymous.

45:57.536 --> 45:59.026
- Above all else...
- Shut up, Bug.

46:03.542 --> 46:05.510
We've been boys for a long time.

46:09.714 --> 46:11.147
I love what you guys do here.

46:13.018 --> 46:14.018
Now, Bug...

46:19.357 --> 46:21.049
But I'm gonna have to
kick the shit out of you

46:21.059 --> 46:22.526
if you don't start talking to me.

46:23.228 --> 46:24.661
I'll get you a name.

46:24.729 --> 46:25.821
Thank you.

46:27.866 --> 46:29.426
I'm gonna need one more thing from you.

46:58.864 --> 47:00.195
Yusheng's close.

47:01.099 --> 47:02.123
Time is up.

47:02.234 --> 47:04.964
You're asking him to give up
his life's work.

47:05.070 --> 47:07.197
We both know that
that's not what this is about.

47:07.272 --> 47:09.433
You know exactly what that tech can do.

47:10.041 --> 47:11.474
Time is up!

47:13.745 --> 47:15.269
No!

47:27.659 --> 47:28.990
Battle is over.

47:29.094 --> 47:34.225
Inmates 1789, 3486, 6412,

47:34.299 --> 47:36.233
you've earned two hours of sanctuary time.

47:50.148 --> 47:51.615
I need your help.

47:56.354 --> 47:59.187
One of you knows the layout of this place.

48:03.929 --> 48:06.591
Wait. The sanctuary.

48:07.599 --> 48:09.123
Have you ever been in?

48:14.506 --> 48:17.134
Give me that layout, I can get you in.

48:21.947 --> 48:23.005
We are Legion.

49:06.224 --> 49:07.589
We are Legion.

50:10.922 --> 50:12.116
Count Zero.

50:15.994 --> 50:19.987
If you give me the logic of the layout,
I can get us out of here.

51:16.988 --> 51:18.387
How did they know?

51:24.162 --> 51:25.959
Kimbral was trying to upstage you.

51:37.242 --> 51:38.903
You told me everything.

51:41.479 --> 51:43.208
You work for the prison.

51:44.883 --> 51:47.010
I run the prison.

52:00.432 --> 52:02.923
Our Jasper Kimbral? I don't get it.

52:03.768 --> 52:06.261
You got to follow the footprints
from the time he left this place

52:06.271 --> 52:07.363
to wherever he is now.

52:08.373 --> 52:09.601
Hades has got to be somewhere.

52:10.275 --> 52:11.708
Yeah, the underworld.

52:13.445 --> 52:14.805
Abigail, can you give us a minute?

52:20.051 --> 52:21.075
Okay.

52:22.020 --> 52:24.716
I know we've had our differences,
but I got to hear it from you.

52:24.789 --> 52:26.120
Swear to me we're okay.

52:28.226 --> 52:30.346
What are you talking about, man?
Of course we're good.

52:30.762 --> 52:31.786
All right.

52:31.896 --> 52:34.296
And you're still paying me
good money to hack shit, right?

52:35.867 --> 52:37.266
Why would I mess that up?

52:37.969 --> 52:40.130
So what've you been working on
behind closed doors?

52:43.908 --> 52:45.876
Let's just say I'm working on something

52:45.944 --> 52:48.037
that will improve the communications
between us.

52:57.755 --> 53:00.622
Hello, Shu. You've met my zookeeper.

53:08.733 --> 53:09.893
We couldn't break 'em.

53:11.636 --> 53:12.660
Extraordinary.

53:13.938 --> 53:16.600
Three men,
and they wouldn't turn on one another.

53:19.978 --> 53:21.240
But you...

53:23.515 --> 53:25.073
you've got them on your side.

53:26.784 --> 53:28.445
You got them to trust you.

53:34.859 --> 53:37.794
I've waited a long time
to see that look on your face.

53:43.668 --> 53:46.466
Look who's here. It's Lukey.

53:47.272 --> 53:51.003
Aw, come on. Aren't you guys happy
to see each other?

53:55.880 --> 53:59.782
When the investors of this place
found out that Ray Breslin's protégé

53:59.851 --> 54:03.287
had been cut loose, you can imagine.

54:04.455 --> 54:07.151
Breslin cost them a lot of money
on their last investment.

54:07.225 --> 54:09.625
These people do not like losing money.

54:11.362 --> 54:12.829
They needed someone better...

54:14.032 --> 54:15.226
more current,

54:16.000 --> 54:18.332
so... voilà.

54:19.003 --> 54:20.664
Welcome to Hades.

54:22.340 --> 54:26.003
So, we're here
because you want your revenge.

54:26.511 --> 54:27.637
Yes.

54:28.246 --> 54:32.512
Unwavering, complete and definitive.

54:39.057 --> 54:41.890
See, everyone in this zoo
is worth money to me.

54:42.994 --> 54:45.224
They all have information
that someone out there

54:45.330 --> 54:47.195
thinks is worth millions of dollars...

54:48.099 --> 54:51.034
especially your cousin Yusheng.

54:53.504 --> 54:57.201
You two... you're worth nothing to me.

54:58.409 --> 55:00.289
Then why don't you kill us
and get it over with?

55:01.112 --> 55:02.792
Where's your fighting spirit at, Luke?
Huh?

55:04.082 --> 55:06.414
This place is designed to give you hope.

55:07.051 --> 55:09.019
You win a battle, you get benefits.

55:09.087 --> 55:11.749
Read a book. Make art.

55:11.856 --> 55:15.383
You lose a battle, then you lose food.

55:15.860 --> 55:17.259
Start to doubt yourself.

55:18.029 --> 55:21.192
Then you set goals, and you rise again.

55:22.033 --> 55:25.764
All the drama of the human condition
is represented right here

55:26.404 --> 55:27.404
in my zoo.

55:29.574 --> 55:31.906
I'm gonna make sure that you two
have plenty to do.

55:33.945 --> 55:37.381
When you wake up, you'll be the men
who sold out Count Zero.

55:38.616 --> 55:41.949
That should give you a unique perspective
on the human condition.

55:42.053 --> 55:45.216
Inmate 1764, report for battle in the zoo.

55:52.563 --> 55:55.396
Inmate 1924, report for battle in the zoo.

56:36.107 --> 56:37.107
Begin battle.

57:19.817 --> 57:23.548
When he's in the zoo,
make sure he fights every day.

57:25.490 --> 57:27.822
There are no more truce days for Shu...

57:30.228 --> 57:33.925
until his will is broken
and we have Yusheng's technology.

57:46.410 --> 57:50.710
So you have no layout.
There is no routine.

57:52.083 --> 57:53.448
And you have no help.

57:54.952 --> 57:59.082
But there's always a plan B,
even for these assholes.

58:01.459 --> 58:04.553
They try to make this place
look totally automated,

58:04.629 --> 58:06.597
but you saw those human guards.

58:09.867 --> 58:11.300
That's their plan B.

58:13.437 --> 58:14.870
What is yours, Shu?

58:20.578 --> 58:21.636
They're alive.

58:27.218 --> 58:29.152
Kimbral, report.

58:29.887 --> 58:31.787
We're closer than ever
to breaking Yusheng.

58:32.790 --> 58:35.953
Closer? Well, report back when you do.

58:37.929 --> 58:40.898
Focus more on getting that patent
than your revenge.

58:42.934 --> 58:44.629
It's a risk bringing him here.

58:49.607 --> 58:51.268
He beat their last facility.

58:52.410 --> 58:54.435
I'm gonna show them he can't beat mine.

59:07.191 --> 59:08.191
Let's see some hands!

59:08.292 --> 59:09.292
Now! Let's see 'em!

59:12.129 --> 59:13.653
Target's compliant.

59:15.099 --> 59:16.739
- Yeah, we got him.
- Bringing him in now.

59:18.803 --> 59:19.963
Lock him up, lock him...

59:50.301 --> 59:51.962
Before it was all theoretical.

59:52.536 --> 59:54.060
What design is best,

59:54.171 --> 59:56.537
what strategy works against what defense.

59:57.208 --> 59:58.402
But now it's real.

59:59.410 --> 01:00:01.310
You against me.

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:06.248
All right, you won.

01:00:08.986 --> 01:00:09.986
Not yet.

01:00:11.822 --> 01:00:16.225
I wanted to go more algorithms,
let the machines run the show.

01:00:16.894 --> 01:00:18.259
You said no.

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:23.399
You talked about human intuition.
The value of teamwork.

01:00:24.602 --> 01:00:26.001
Well, there's three of you now.

01:00:28.105 --> 01:00:29.367
Show me.

01:00:33.577 --> 01:00:35.545
All prisoners report to the zoo.

01:00:35.613 --> 01:00:38.582
I repeat, all prisoners report to the zoo.

01:00:47.858 --> 01:00:51.453
Inmate 9051, report for battle in the zoo.

01:00:51.562 --> 01:00:54.122
I repeat, report for battle in the zoo.

01:01:25.129 --> 01:01:26.426
Begin battle.

01:01:51.288 --> 01:01:55.122
Battle is over. I repeat, battle is over.

01:02:22.787 --> 01:02:24.880
You have one new message.

01:02:25.556 --> 01:02:28.491
DeRosa, it's Hush. They took Breslin.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.491
All our guys are in Hades.

01:02:31.162 --> 01:02:33.082
You're the only one
that can help us get 'em out.

01:02:33.731 --> 01:02:34.731
Call me.

01:02:45.042 --> 01:02:48.068
Shu... you can't give up.

01:02:50.181 --> 01:02:52.513
What would you know about giving up?

01:02:54.819 --> 01:02:57.083
You never stood for anything.

01:02:58.722 --> 01:03:00.019
Shu, I'm sorry.

01:03:00.091 --> 01:03:02.525
You just wanted to be rich.

01:03:02.593 --> 01:03:03.821
What's wrong with that?

01:03:05.096 --> 01:03:07.223
My family never had any money.

01:03:08.365 --> 01:03:10.560
And when your parents died,
we had to pay for you, too.

01:03:10.668 --> 01:03:12.260
Okay? Don't you ever forget that.

01:03:14.572 --> 01:03:16.870
Go ahead. Go ahead!

01:03:17.408 --> 01:03:19.569
Lash out! Do it!

01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:23.436
It's what you've always done
when you can't control things.

01:03:25.749 --> 01:03:27.080
You're always the same.

01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:36.051
What?

01:03:36.427 --> 01:03:37.519
You are right.

01:03:39.263 --> 01:03:40.730
I'm predictable.

01:03:43.634 --> 01:03:45.602
Kimbral knew what we were gonna do.

01:03:47.104 --> 01:03:48.731
He played to my arrogance.

01:03:50.407 --> 01:03:53.274
He knew I'd take it upon myself
to get us out.

01:03:54.812 --> 01:03:56.609
He played us perfectly.

01:03:58.582 --> 01:03:59.742
How do we play him?

01:04:00.317 --> 01:04:01.648
Plan B.

01:04:04.321 --> 01:04:06.755
We stop being so predictable.

01:04:12.897 --> 01:04:14.262
I'm ready to talk.

01:04:16.066 --> 01:04:18.091
The tech details are complex.

01:04:18.836 --> 01:04:21.100
I will give them to you in stages.

01:04:21.172 --> 01:04:24.266
Give me everything, or no deal.

01:04:38.522 --> 01:04:40.456
- We're in.
- Ray, you hear me?

01:04:40.524 --> 01:04:42.924
- I can hear you clearly.
- Yes!

01:04:42.993 --> 01:04:45.860
Who knew your amateur
dentist skills would pay off?

01:04:45.963 --> 01:04:49.194
Now aren't you glad I spent all of those
company hours in my playroom?

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.962
- What do you got?
- I been up for three nights straight.

01:04:52.036 --> 01:04:53.936
Password breaker hit the mother lode.

01:04:54.004 --> 01:04:56.302
I'm through the firewall
and into the Galileo mainframe.

01:04:56.373 --> 01:04:58.466
Receiving good reads
from all systems at Hades.

01:04:58.542 --> 01:05:02.672
My best GPS spiders are working overtime,
and we only have <i>33o%</i> of the layout.

01:05:03.447 --> 01:05:05.039
No exact exit strategy for you.

01:05:05.149 --> 01:05:07.117
We need an access point from the inside.

01:05:07.818 --> 01:05:09.479
You need to get Yusheng to work on it.

01:05:10.054 --> 01:05:12.147
We got eyes on us 24/7.

01:05:13.691 --> 01:05:15.625
- Can you get the cameras?
- Yeah.

01:05:15.693 --> 01:05:17.991
- I can guarantee a minute.
- Seventy seconds.

01:05:18.062 --> 01:05:20.121
Maybe 70 seconds,
but after that, it's gonna know.

01:05:20.197 --> 01:05:21.323
I'll take it.

01:05:23.234 --> 01:05:24.834
There's one more thing I want you to do.

01:05:25.302 --> 01:05:28.897
Can you get access to Galileo's voice box?

01:05:35.512 --> 01:05:36.809
What's wrong with the boom box?

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.007
<i>Let's move together. Flo was one.</i>

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:41.711
That's Qingdao.

01:05:52.096 --> 01:05:54.997
Cameras 48 through 58 cover spoke B.

01:05:55.065 --> 01:05:56.555
We can clear it in 30 seconds.

01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:08.444
Now.

01:06:11.348 --> 01:06:12.372
Sixty-eight.

01:06:14.251 --> 01:06:15.445
Sixty-six.

01:06:15.552 --> 01:06:17.452
You managed to learn my language
after all.

01:06:17.554 --> 01:06:19.579
We only got about 70 seconds.

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:21.749
Hush is trying to get the critical data,

01:06:21.859 --> 01:06:24.623
but he's only got
<i>33o%</i> of the layout so far.

01:06:24.728 --> 01:06:26.855
No direct paths to the exits.

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:28.192
He's hacking Galileo?

01:06:29.233 --> 01:06:32.202
- Affirmative. He's gonna need our help.
- Less than 40 seconds.

01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:34.066
This is an inverted design

01:06:34.138 --> 01:06:36.971
that protects the center and control rooms
from the outside in,

01:06:37.074 --> 01:06:38.905
that's what makes it so difficult.

01:06:39.476 --> 01:06:42.411
We need to give him
a physical access point from the inside.

01:06:42.479 --> 01:06:44.640
Talk to Yusheng. Get him to work on it.

01:06:44.748 --> 01:06:46.215
Ten seconds. Now.

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:47.776
Just be patient.

01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:57.759
I heard that a car chase went down at
the warehouse complex near the rail yard.

01:06:57.828 --> 01:06:59.295
One of the cars was Luke's.

01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:01.462
Going down there to check it out.

01:07:02.399 --> 01:07:03.457
I'll figure it out.

01:07:03.567 --> 01:07:05.933
All right. Breslin and the guys
are working from the inside

01:07:06.003 --> 01:07:08.403
on a device
that will help us locate Hades.

01:07:08.472 --> 01:07:09.496
Great.

01:07:10.341 --> 01:07:13.674
You find these guys, I want in.

01:07:13.777 --> 01:07:14.903
I'll be in touch.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.168
The guys we can trust
in most of the spokes are in.

01:07:42.272 --> 01:07:43.296
Be ready.

01:07:47.044 --> 01:07:49.137
The zookeeper has the specs.
Only a matter of time

01:07:49.213 --> 01:07:51.647
before whoever he's giving them to
realizes they won't work.

01:07:52.182 --> 01:07:55.879
You have never wanted to learn Go.
I'd recommend it.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.019
Patience is the most important part
of this game.

01:08:00.124 --> 01:08:02.149
Did you hear what I just said?
We got to go.

01:08:02.226 --> 01:08:06.663
We have the manpower, but no way out.
We keep working.

01:08:07.131 --> 01:08:09.326
But first, we need your help.

01:08:14.705 --> 01:08:17.002
I know you get stuff for inmates.

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:20.669
I need a favor, or I tell the machine.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:37.484
You move all the pieces together.

01:09:38.455 --> 01:09:40.046
Everything flows as one.

01:09:57.608 --> 01:10:00.441
Connection with inside
access point established.

01:10:00.511 --> 01:10:03.742
Hades located. Scanning layout now.

01:10:12.489 --> 01:10:15.583
We have the layout. We know their routine.

01:10:15.659 --> 01:10:16.819
What about help?

01:10:18.428 --> 01:10:19.827
We got that covered.

01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:35.439
- I'm ready to shut Galileo down.
- Okay.

01:10:35.512 --> 01:10:37.605
Our exit strategy is solid,

01:10:37.681 --> 01:10:40.149
but you still got to get lucky
to get past those human guards.

01:10:45.789 --> 01:10:48.121
There's two maintenance doors
on either side of the zoo.

01:10:48.191 --> 01:10:49.716
When the lights go out,
you got three minutes

01:10:49.726 --> 01:10:51.366
before the system starts waking up again.

01:11:02.639 --> 01:11:03.639
Showtime.

01:11:12.716 --> 01:11:14.411
System under attack.

01:11:17.554 --> 01:11:19.078
System under attack.

01:11:21.391 --> 01:11:22.585
System failure.

01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:25.051
System failure.

01:11:25.162 --> 01:11:26.652
System failure.

01:11:29.533 --> 01:11:30.864
All systems down.

01:11:30.934 --> 01:11:34.062
Clock's ticking. Time to use those muscles
before the doors relock.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.067
- All right, come on. Push.
- Push.

01:12:04.434 --> 01:12:07.301
I am Galileo. All systems online.

01:12:09.206 --> 01:12:10.264
Halt!

01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:14.875
The intruders are heading west
through hall 23.

01:12:18.915 --> 01:12:20.644
This way to the medical center.

01:12:24.921 --> 01:12:28.584
DeRosa, your hunch was right.
Location of Hades confirmed.

01:12:28.659 --> 01:12:30.058
Sending you the coordinates now.

01:12:30.961 --> 01:12:33.122
Communication established.

01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:35.664
Ray Breslin is attempting to break Hades.

01:12:35.766 --> 01:12:37.927
I want you to see how the prison responds.

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:41.469
The med bots are still down.

01:12:41.972 --> 01:12:44.133
The system isn't fully online.

01:12:48.478 --> 01:12:50.275
I need you cue balls to cover our back.

01:12:52.182 --> 01:12:53.274
We are Legion.

01:12:56.453 --> 01:12:58.751
Whatever. Let's go. Come on!

01:13:00.023 --> 01:13:01.023
Cover their asses.

01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:11.592
All communications blocked.
Closed-circuit system activated.

01:13:12.602 --> 01:13:14.001
Kimbral cut communications.

01:13:14.104 --> 01:13:16.595
He shut us down. Closed off the com link.

01:13:16.673 --> 01:13:17.697
What about our bots?

01:13:17.808 --> 01:13:19.248
They're still working but minimized.

01:13:19.309 --> 01:13:21.038
He's walled off Galileo's prime function.

01:13:21.144 --> 01:13:22.975
Without a clear channel,
I can't control it.

01:13:23.046 --> 01:13:25.947
The intruders are on corridor 37.

01:13:26.016 --> 01:13:28.780
Clearing all access to main floor.

01:13:28.852 --> 01:13:31.514
Resetting Hades structure
to secure position.

01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:45.732
Shit. What do we do?

01:13:47.871 --> 01:13:49.964
Hades restructure complete.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.302
Galileo...

01:13:52.142 --> 01:13:53.507
gas them.

01:14:04.254 --> 01:14:06.586
Breslin, Declerc.

01:14:07.057 --> 01:14:09.416
Two circular floors
on top of each other like a birthday cake.

01:14:09.426 --> 01:14:10.859
The ventilation system.

01:14:10.927 --> 01:14:13.862
Two HVACs, flow vents and ceiling.

01:14:14.731 --> 01:14:15.731
Up there!

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.658
Yusheng. Come on.

01:14:30.046 --> 01:14:31.240
There you are.

01:14:31.948 --> 01:14:34.280
We're getting pushback
from the terminal in medical.

01:14:35.685 --> 01:14:36.845
We're about to have company.

01:14:44.127 --> 01:14:45.185
Anyone got a coin?

01:14:46.096 --> 01:14:47.529
How do you beat a maze?

01:14:47.597 --> 01:14:48.962
Stick to the right.

01:14:55.105 --> 01:14:57.232
Freeze! Freeze, or we'll open fire!

01:15:05.448 --> 01:15:06.608
Seal us up!

01:15:13.557 --> 01:15:15.047
Don't know how long we can hold it.

01:15:24.434 --> 01:15:25.458
Keep going!

01:15:29.139 --> 01:15:30.139
I'm going back for Luke.

01:15:30.607 --> 01:15:32.247
All right. I'm going to the control room.

01:15:32.943 --> 01:15:34.171
Yusheng, come with me.

01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:49.516
- Freeze!
- Show me your hands!

01:15:49.626 --> 01:15:52.424
- Show me your hands!
- Hold it! Don't move!

01:15:52.929 --> 01:15:54.209
- We are Legion.
- We are Legion.

01:15:56.466 --> 01:15:59.765
We got to be in sync.
On one. Three, two, one.

01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:03.204
- All right, you know what to do.
- Yes. Go.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.662
Medical secured.

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.571
Kimbral, report.

01:16:39.342 --> 01:16:43.369
He's good, but my machine always wins.

01:16:43.914 --> 01:16:45.040
Not sure about that.

01:16:48.051 --> 01:16:49.075
Okay.

01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:53.321
I give up. You got me.

01:16:55.325 --> 01:16:56.815
But you're still in Hades.

01:16:57.227 --> 01:17:00.822
And with Galileo back to his full power,
I just triggered his autopilot orders.

01:17:00.897 --> 01:17:04.025
All the systems that Hush was attacking
are now closed.

01:17:04.701 --> 01:17:06.100
You're never getting out of here.

01:17:11.741 --> 01:17:13.436
You know, kid, I got to give you credit.

01:17:14.577 --> 01:17:16.169
You did a great job here.

01:17:17.447 --> 01:17:19.540
You built a prison. Looks like it has...

01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:22.348
no weaknesses.

01:17:23.687 --> 01:17:25.245
But you know what?

01:17:25.355 --> 01:17:28.256
There is always one.

01:18:11.101 --> 01:18:12.101
Oh, yeah.

01:18:41.464 --> 01:18:44.331
Now I am the zookeeper.

01:18:50.473 --> 01:18:52.668
I have this acquaintance friend of mine.

01:18:53.543 --> 01:18:56.034
Big guy. And he did me a favor.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.813
I gave him this account number, special.

01:18:59.883 --> 01:19:02.647
Couldn't crack the code, but he did.

01:19:03.219 --> 01:19:06.211
And he traced the money,
and he traced the account.

01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:08.484
Sparrow.

01:19:09.893 --> 01:19:13.124
And you're the one who's behind all this.

01:19:14.664 --> 01:19:16.063
Then we made a plan.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:27.737
Solar system failure.
Solar system heating up.

01:19:28.645 --> 01:19:31.045
I just told you Galileo
was back to his full power.

01:19:31.648 --> 01:19:32.876
It doesn't need solar.

01:19:33.883 --> 01:19:34.883
Let it blow.

01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:49.755
There's the opening, DeRosa, as promised.

01:19:51.768 --> 01:19:52.928
Yusheng.

01:19:56.172 --> 01:19:57.537
- Freeze!
- Get down!

01:19:59.409 --> 01:20:00.409
Freeze!

01:20:02.045 --> 01:20:04.605
I could've been looking for this place
for a long time.

01:20:05.715 --> 01:20:07.205
I would've found it,

01:20:07.283 --> 01:20:10.013
but it's a lot tougher breaking in
from the outside.

01:20:10.887 --> 01:20:13.947
But I knew that wasn't gonna happen
because I know you.

01:20:15.191 --> 01:20:16.385
I know how you think...

01:20:17.227 --> 01:20:21.459
and I knew you would be
coming for me, and you did.

01:20:22.298 --> 01:20:25.028
I'm glad, 'cause I like working,

01:20:25.101 --> 01:20:28.093
as you can see, from the inside out.

01:20:29.606 --> 01:20:34.202
Hades had one very, very, very weak spot.

01:20:38.815 --> 01:20:40.043
You.

01:20:50.093 --> 01:20:53.494
Security breach at main door.
Forced entry.

01:20:54.831 --> 01:20:56.162
Hades compromised.

01:20:57.333 --> 01:20:59.324
It's time. Let's finish it right.

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:15.743
Stop! Stop! Get on the ground!

01:21:16.085 --> 01:21:18.451
On the ground now! Let's go!

01:21:18.922 --> 01:21:20.116
Down! Down on the ground!

01:21:40.343 --> 01:21:42.709
DeRosa, long time no see.

01:21:42.812 --> 01:21:45.872
Nice PJs. Where's your fucking teddy bear?

01:21:47.984 --> 01:21:51.511
Prisoner9051,
report for battle in the zoo.

01:21:55.024 --> 01:21:57.219
Let's see what you can do
without your tech.

01:21:59.562 --> 01:22:02.463
After I put my fist through your face,
I'm gonna crucify you, kid.

01:23:18.975 --> 01:23:20.067
What'd I miss?

01:23:28.117 --> 01:23:29.709
Guess that makes us even.

01:23:29.786 --> 01:23:31.048
Thanks, Luke.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.144
Yeah.

01:24:26.476 --> 01:24:27.476
Hey!

01:24:27.543 --> 01:24:29.477
- Relax.
- There he is.

01:24:29.545 --> 01:24:31.012
Nice of you to join us.

01:24:31.681 --> 01:24:32.807
Had some free time.

01:24:41.157 --> 01:24:42.454
Get in, get in, get in!

01:24:56.072 --> 01:24:57.471
Hush, you hear me?

01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.474
Good to hear you. We thought we lost you.

01:25:00.243 --> 01:25:02.234
Shu and Yusheng are safe and sound.

01:25:02.345 --> 01:25:03.676
How about that?

01:25:03.746 --> 01:25:05.509
Plan B actually worked.

01:25:08.151 --> 01:25:11.882
Remember, Shu, with brains and patience,
nothing's impossible.

01:25:20.096 --> 01:25:21.859
Can somebody tell me
where the hell we are?

01:25:21.931 --> 01:25:23.131
You want to tell him, big guy?

01:25:25.268 --> 01:25:26.360
Not really.

01:25:27.036 --> 01:25:28.036
Atlanta.

01:25:28.504 --> 01:25:29.994
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:25:30.072 --> 01:25:31.752
Hades is in Atlanta? How is that possible?

01:25:33.376 --> 01:25:36.277
Kimbral, come in. Report.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.672
You're not Kimbral.

01:25:41.384 --> 01:25:42.408
No, I'm not.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.447
But I got to tell you something.
I'm really getting sick of this shit.

01:25:48.925 --> 01:25:50.222
So whoever you are...

01:25:51.461 --> 01:25:52.461
wherever you are...

01:25:54.864 --> 01:25:55.888
we're gonna find you...

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.400
for sure.
