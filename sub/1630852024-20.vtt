WEBVTT

00:04.178 --> 00:08.269
[Jughead] On the eve of war,
we gathered in Archie's house.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.749
Percival didn't know that
we were back from the dead,

00:10.793 --> 00:12.795
and that gave us
a slight advantage.

00:12.838 --> 00:16.059
Though he remained
the ultimate man of mystery.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.322
What do we know about Percival
after all this time?

00:18.366 --> 00:21.891
Well, we know he's a magical
sorcerer and his powers
are getting stronger

00:21.934 --> 00:23.762
the closer Bailey's Comet
gets to us.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.026
We know that
he's building a ghost train

00:26.069 --> 00:28.550
which will grant him power
over the souls of the dead,

00:28.593 --> 00:31.248
though we don't know how or why
he's planning to use them.

00:31.292 --> 00:35.122
And we know that he sees
Baby Anthony as a major threat
to his future.

00:35.165 --> 00:38.473
We know that the Pickens family
has a long-standing history
with Riverdale.

00:38.516 --> 00:41.432
For instance, that horrid
General Augustus Pickens

00:41.476 --> 00:43.173
slaughtered the Uktena tribe
back in the day.

00:43.217 --> 00:46.872
But there is no record
of a Percival
in the Pickens family,

00:46.916 --> 00:48.570
at least not
in the Blossom archives.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.181
Before Heraldo died,
he looked into Percival for me,

00:51.225 --> 00:55.098
and he said it's like
he didn't even exist
before showing up in Riverdale.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.187
So where the hell
did he come from then?

00:57.231 --> 00:59.842
Drilling down,
what does Percival want?

00:59.885 --> 01:01.713
What does he actually want?
The apocalypse?

01:01.757 --> 01:05.152
No, I think that's only
if he doesn't get
what he wants.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.936
What about our powers?

01:06.979 --> 01:09.025
They all appeared
at the same time
that Percival showed up.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.418
Is that a coincidence

01:10.461 --> 01:12.333
-or a connection?
-Do you have any theories, Jug?

01:12.376 --> 01:15.727
I mean, I have one that
I'm working on,
but it's too early to discuss.

01:15.771 --> 01:18.426
Okay. We need to be smart
about our next move.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.036
We need a plan.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.385
Strategize.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.039
In the meantime,
we should make Percival believe

01:23.083 --> 01:25.346
that it's business
as usual in Riverdale.

01:25.389 --> 01:28.914
In that case, I should
head over to the casino.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.829
Percival's staying
in one of my champagne suites.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.353
And Reggie is still working
with him,

01:32.396 --> 01:34.224
so maybe I can try
to suss him out.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.226
Okay. Be careful, Ronnie.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.488
Always am, Archie.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.627
Sweet cousin,

01:45.670 --> 01:46.889
you need to pay
a visit to Thornhill

01:46.932 --> 01:48.499
posthaste.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.589
Someone very near and dear
to your heart wants to see you.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.070
What are you talking about?
Who does?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.594
Look, I'll tell you,
but you can't lose your mind.

01:56.638 --> 01:59.902
And you mustn't breathe
a word about this to anyone.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.034
Okay?

02:02.078 --> 02:07.301
Okay, so what is this
theory of yours?

02:07.344 --> 02:12.001
[Jughead] So I told Tabitha
about the other Jughead,

02:12.044 --> 02:16.092
the mysterious plate
of Pop's food that materialized
out of nowhere.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.138
My other strange visitors.

02:18.181 --> 02:22.794
Okay, so you think
that you opened up a portal?

02:22.838 --> 02:25.188
Yes. One there
and one there.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.407
How?

02:26.450 --> 02:29.061
Well, I've been doing
some research. Here.

02:29.105 --> 02:32.152
Read, starting at this
yellow sticky.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.199
There's a theory
that some mind readers

02:36.243 --> 02:39.333
aren't really reading minds,
but opening portals

02:39.376 --> 02:43.250
into people's
psychic landscapes
and stepping through them.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.643
Which is what it feels
like I've been doing.

02:47.341 --> 02:51.562
Okay. So you think that
you're not just a mind reader,

02:51.606 --> 02:55.000
but also a portal opener?

02:55.044 --> 02:56.698
Yeah, in the same way
that you thought

02:56.741 --> 02:59.135
you were a time traveler,
but you're actually an angel.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.268
And, and, and when your powers
were going crazy,

03:01.311 --> 03:05.446
you think that
you unconsciously
opened up portals down here.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.447
Hmm.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.231
But to where?

03:08.275 --> 03:12.017
I'm not sure,
but it's someplace

03:12.061 --> 03:15.456
where there is someone
that looks exactly like me.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.500
Like another Jughead.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.372
And there's another Pop's, too.

03:18.415 --> 03:22.506
And I was hearing voices
and they sounded
a lot like our friends' voices.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.074
And there's a typewriter
typing too.

03:25.117 --> 03:28.208
Are you talking
about another dimension?

03:29.774 --> 03:33.517
Yeah. I didn't want
to say that word, but yes,

03:33.561 --> 03:35.345
and I think
we should explore it.

03:35.389 --> 03:39.001
But, Jughead,
we're getting ready
for a war in this dimension.

03:39.044 --> 03:42.787
I know I know that, Tabitha,
but our powers
started manifesting

03:42.831 --> 03:46.138
after that big explosion
at Archie's, right?

03:46.182 --> 03:48.184
That was the epicenter.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.623
And then the first time
that any of us saw Percival
was Archie at his house.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.583
Percival has these
supernatural powers.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.280
Now, a lot of us do, too.

03:57.324 --> 04:01.415
I think there's a connection
between the explosion,

04:01.458 --> 04:04.287
our powers
and Percival's arrival.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.072
I just... I'm not sure...

04:07.116 --> 04:09.510
that we'll find them here
in Riverdale.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.903
[scoffs]

04:11.947 --> 04:14.123
Do you want to go
dimension hopping with me?

04:14.166 --> 04:17.126
[Percival] Alice,
thank you so much
for seeing me.

04:17.169 --> 04:21.391
Of course. What can I do
for you, Mr. Mayor?

04:21.435 --> 04:25.003
Well, my inevitable victory
is almost upon us.

04:25.047 --> 04:28.137
And I wanted to document
my history for posterity.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.661
By granting me an exclusive
sit-down interview,

04:30.705 --> 04:32.141
Barbara Walters style?

04:32.184 --> 04:33.751
Exactly.

04:33.795 --> 04:37.364
And afterwards,
RIVW can broadcast
the live execution

04:37.407 --> 04:38.800
of three traitors to our cause.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.845
Reggie and Marty Mantle
and Kevin Keller.

04:40.889 --> 04:41.846
Come again?

04:43.500 --> 04:44.501
Alice.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.895
We are on the verge of war.

04:46.938 --> 04:50.986
We must now instill terror
and exert absolute control.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.686
Besides, [echoing]
think of the ratings.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.039
Sugar?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.571
What is going on here?

05:12.137 --> 05:13.661
Are those guillotines?

05:14.444 --> 05:15.967
You need to leave, Miss Lodge.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.404
You've been barred
from the premises.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.362
Excuse me. This is my casino.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.321
Not anymore.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.366
In your absence,
the board of directors
had a no confidence vote

05:23.410 --> 05:26.326
and you were relieved
of your duties,
effective immediately.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.718
[chuckles softly]

05:27.762 --> 05:31.896
The scheme reeks of Reggie.
Where is he?

05:31.940 --> 05:34.116
Unfortunately,
he's currently indisposed.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.857
All right, then.
Let me talk to Percival.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.555
Mayor Pickens is very busy
with an important interview,

05:38.599 --> 05:41.776
but he did authorize us
to remove you from the casino

05:41.819 --> 05:42.994
should you show up.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.345
By any means necessary.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.522
Fine.

05:48.565 --> 05:49.479
I'm leaving.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.932
-Betty!
-Polly.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.115
[Jughead] It's like
opening a door.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.379
[breathing heavily]

06:21.250 --> 06:22.251
It's like opening a door.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.393
Like opening a door...

06:45.709 --> 06:48.103
Hello, darkness,
my old friend.

06:50.584 --> 06:54.283
Well... you first.

07:02.639 --> 07:06.513
Whoa, whoa!
What the hell
are you doing here?

07:06.556 --> 07:09.080
-You can't be in this universe.
-Okay.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.604
Hi.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.649
Are you the person
that's been going

07:12.693 --> 07:15.086
through my portals
and stealing my stories?

07:15.130 --> 07:16.000
I'm sorry.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.915
Steal your stories?

07:19.569 --> 07:21.658
Everything you've been writing,
you have clearly stolen

07:21.702 --> 07:24.705
from what you've overheard
happening here in Rivervale.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.447
Wait, did you just
say Rivervale?

07:28.535 --> 07:29.971
Is that where we are?

07:30.014 --> 07:32.626
Some alternate,
parallel universe?

07:32.669 --> 07:36.847
Yes, Rivervale,
as opposed to your Riverdale.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.807
I think you'd better
start talking.

07:39.850 --> 07:43.550
[Jughead] So this other
"Bunker" Jughead
told us about Riverdale

07:43.593 --> 07:47.292
and Rivervale being conjoined
parallel universes.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.469
And how they started
to bleed into each other

07:49.512 --> 07:51.732
and how both would
have self-destructed
if the explosion

07:51.775 --> 07:54.648
in Archie's bedroom
hadn't separated
the two.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.214
One catch.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.565
See, Rivervale
was feeding off of Riverdale.

07:58.608 --> 08:03.526
Anything that was happening
in Riverdale was also happening
here in Rivervale.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.658
But it was darker.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.529
It was even more
twisted and messed up.

08:06.573 --> 08:11.403
People were dying,
the universes were unstable,
and then they split.

08:11.447 --> 08:16.496
Riverdale was saved,
but I had to stay down here

08:16.539 --> 08:19.847
and keep writing in order
to keep Rivervale going.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.589
Okay, so...

08:23.720 --> 08:26.636
you're like a living battery

08:26.680 --> 08:30.118
-whose imagination
fuels this universe?
-Yeah.

08:31.554 --> 08:32.729
That sucks.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.296
Yeah.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.777
And then the portals opened
to Riverdale,

08:36.820 --> 08:38.343
and I heard you typing away.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.649
So, I thought,

08:39.693 --> 08:41.738
oh, I would go and borrow
some of your stories

08:41.782 --> 08:43.348
for inspiration.

08:43.392 --> 08:46.177
But they were all just
recycled stories
from Rivervale.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.397
And anyhow,
the portal's closed.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.966
The portal's closed because
someone named Percival Pickens
killed me.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.707
That's why we're here.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.274
Percival is trying to take over
or destroy Riverdale.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.712
And we're looking
for information
for how to stop him.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.714
I mean, is it possible
that there's another version

09:00.757 --> 09:04.587
of Percival Pickens here
in Rivervale?

09:04.631 --> 09:06.676
Well, not that I know of.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.896
But it's possible.
I don't leave
the bunker much.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.724
Like, ever, actually.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.030
There's no paper trail
for Percival in Riverdale.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.771
But maybe there's one here.

09:14.815 --> 09:15.642
We were thinking
about checking out

09:15.685 --> 09:17.600
the Blossom archives.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.167
Maybe they're different here.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.084
No. Uh-uh.
You can't go up there.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.565
Not since the
"Great Forgetting."

09:25.608 --> 09:28.219
Everything in Rivervale
is in a very delicate balance.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.482
Everything is holding
on just so,

09:30.526 --> 09:32.615
and it started
to get nice and quiet.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.183
Well, the opposite is
happening in Riverdale.

09:35.226 --> 09:38.490
Things are getting crazier,
more supernatural.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.798
What if Rivervale
is now bleeding into

09:41.842 --> 09:43.887
and wreaking havoc
in Riverdale?

09:43.931 --> 09:48.849
Be that as it may,
if someone sees you interacting
with your counterparts,

09:48.892 --> 09:51.678
it could precipitate
another crisis.

09:51.721 --> 09:54.550
Well, aren't you
my counterpart?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.725
Uh, technically, no.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.684
There are two Jugheads
in this universe.

09:57.727 --> 09:58.815
Me and another one.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.730
And he's up topside,

10:00.774 --> 10:01.818
he's living his best life

10:01.862 --> 10:04.734
and I have
to toil away down here.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.736
We will be careful.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.217
I'm assuming that Nana
and Cheryl live
at Thornhill still.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.960
So, Nana Blossom,

10:13.003 --> 10:16.485
her consciousness
went into Cheryl's body.

10:16.528 --> 10:20.054
Which is actually Abigail's
immortal body.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.882
-We'll figure it out.
-Yeah.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.318
No, no, no.

10:23.361 --> 10:26.408
That could lead to a string
of cataclysmic events.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.366
That is what we're facing
back in Riverdale.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.281
But do not worry.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.720
We will do our best
to avoid ourselves.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.994
Well, Mr. Mayor.
Where would you like to start?

10:47.037 --> 10:49.387
The year was 1580.

10:49.431 --> 10:53.348
And a ship named the Ruby Pearl
arrived on these fair shores

10:53.391 --> 10:56.264
carrying a motley
assortment of passengers.

10:56.307 --> 10:59.702
Passengers who'd left
the Old World
for a myriad of reasons.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.443
In any case,

11:01.486 --> 11:04.098
these hardy settlers founded
the first colonies
of the New World

11:04.141 --> 11:08.755
on fertile land by a river
as sweet as it was restorative.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.279
And are you referring
to Sweetwater River?

11:11.322 --> 11:12.584
Mmm.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.892
I was among
those early settlers.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.242
How is that possible?

11:18.286 --> 11:21.115
Patience, Alice.
All will be revealed in time.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.726
Making the journey with me,
were the ancestors of many

11:23.770 --> 11:25.423
who still reside
here today.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.990
Asher Andrews,

11:27.034 --> 11:29.253
Blessing Cooper,

11:29.297 --> 11:31.168
James Jones,

11:31.212 --> 11:32.517
Charity Blossom.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.084
They began building up

11:34.128 --> 11:37.174
Sweetwater Village
like good little workers.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.525
While I, on the other hand,
pursued less
wholesome interests.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.353
Witchcraft and sorcery.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.747
Every night,
while my neighbors slept,

11:44.791 --> 11:48.446
I disappeared into
the Sweetwater woods
to perform arcane rituals.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.927
And it was on one such night
that my activities

11:50.971 --> 11:52.842
involving a girl
from our settlement

11:52.886 --> 11:56.150
were interrupted
by the untimely arrival

11:56.193 --> 11:58.848
of Asher Andrews.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.938
I was brought before
Sweetwater Village's Council.

12:01.982 --> 12:05.028
Their judgment,
swift and cruel.

12:05.072 --> 12:08.162
I was to be executed
for my crimes.

12:08.205 --> 12:15.778
Left in the woods to die
a slow, agonizing death
from starvation and exposure.

12:15.822 --> 12:19.042
And what exactly were
your crimes, Mr. Mayor?

12:19.086 --> 12:21.088
I was trying
to conjure the devil, Alice.

12:21.131 --> 12:24.308
And while
my ritual wasn't completed,

12:24.352 --> 12:26.310
I had succeeded
in getting his attention.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.967
I'll never forget that night.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.539
He told me he'd been
attracted by my spell,

12:37.582 --> 12:39.280
then enticed by my fate.

12:43.197 --> 12:46.896
He offered my freedom
at the price of my soul.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.773
[Polly] Hey, there.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.949
Feeling better?

12:57.428 --> 12:58.299
Yeah...

12:59.909 --> 13:01.389
Polly, is it really you?

13:01.432 --> 13:02.607
It is.

13:02.651 --> 13:03.783
It's really me.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.483
Oh, my God.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.832
[sobbing]

13:13.096 --> 13:14.184
I'm so sorry.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.319
I'm so sorry for everything.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.974
I'm so sorry
for the fight that we had,

13:21.017 --> 13:22.845
that I wasn't
a better sister to you,

13:22.889 --> 13:26.544
that I wasn't able
to protect you or save you.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.850
Betty.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.070
None of that matters now.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.638
All of that pain,
all that suffering, it just...

13:33.682 --> 13:35.205
fell away.

13:35.249 --> 13:38.034
And I don't need you to explain
or apologize for anything.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.471
You never did anything
to hurt me.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.821
I'm the reason that you died.

13:44.475 --> 13:45.476
And if we hadn't fought--

13:45.520 --> 13:47.043
No, Betty.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.741
I forgive you.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.614
There's nothing
to forgive you for.
But I forgive you.

13:52.657 --> 13:53.745
But you don't understand.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.443
They're telling me--

13:55.486 --> 13:57.967
They're telling me that
I'm the Harlot of Babylon,
Polly,

13:58.011 --> 14:00.056
and that I won't be able
to get into heaven.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.579
Who?

14:01.623 --> 14:03.103
Who told you that?

14:03.146 --> 14:06.671
It doesn't matter because
it's how I feel about myself.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.152
I've felt
that way before, too.

14:09.196 --> 14:14.941
But I am here to tell you
that you are worth
so much more than that.

14:14.984 --> 14:18.422
So please just sit
with that fact
and then let it all go.

14:19.597 --> 14:20.598
I don't think I can't.

14:20.642 --> 14:21.861
There's too much...

14:23.863 --> 14:26.343
darkness churning
inside me, Polly.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.302
Just be still.

14:28.345 --> 14:32.262
Be a vessel
and let grace wash over you.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.742
Fill you.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.919
Think about being a good person
because you are one.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.144
As if I wouldn't
be able to access

14:44.187 --> 14:49.062
the Babylonium security cameras
remotely. Idiots.

14:49.105 --> 14:53.283
Okay. Let's see exactly
what's going on in my casino.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.159
[groaning]

15:00.029 --> 15:01.639
Dad! Dad!

15:01.683 --> 15:03.119
-What the hell?
-Dad!

15:03.163 --> 15:05.078
Hey! Help! Help!
We need a medic! Help!

15:05.121 --> 15:06.906
-Come on!
-[gasps]

15:07.950 --> 15:09.169
What happened?

15:09.212 --> 15:10.561
My dad just had a heart attack.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.954
We gotta
get him to the hospital.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.968
Let us out of the vault
or your boy here dies.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.013
[Frank] You won't do it.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.014
You're a clown, not a killer.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.885
You're all right with this?

15:29.929 --> 15:32.670
I'm not pointing
the gun at you, Reggie.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.150
I'm trained on Tom.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.109
And he knows that
I'm prepared
to pull the trigger

15:36.152 --> 15:38.024
because Tom and I are soldiers.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.503
We know
what we're fighting for.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.418
We're prepared to kill for it.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.942
And die for it.

15:42.985 --> 15:47.163
So, if you don't let Tom
go by the count of three,

15:47.207 --> 15:49.296
you're gonna have his blood
on your hands.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.819
One...

15:52.081 --> 15:53.126
Two...

16:00.089 --> 16:02.396
Don't ever do anything
like that again,

16:02.439 --> 16:04.789
because next time
I'm just gonna shoot.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.878
Come on, Dad.
This isn't you.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.576
This is Percival
controlling you.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.056
You need to fight him.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.492
[Sheriff Keller] Look at
the bright side, son.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.668
With this execution,
Percival is going to make you

16:13.711 --> 16:16.714
more famous than you ever
would have gotten on your own.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.020
[sighs]

16:25.723 --> 16:26.942
Oh, my gosh. Jughead! Hi.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.030
Hi.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.510
What's up?

16:29.553 --> 16:32.948
We were hoping to take a look
at the Blossom archives.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.038
-We're doing some
research for--
-A new comic book project?

16:36.082 --> 16:37.692
That's so exciting!

16:37.735 --> 16:40.347
But unfortunately,
the Blossom archives
got transferred

16:40.390 --> 16:42.131
to Highsmith College
two years ago.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.394
Oh-kay.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.918
Well, in that case,
can we talk to Nana Blossom?

16:46.962 --> 16:49.008
And ask her a few questions.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.662
[Jughead] What happened to her?

16:51.706 --> 16:55.101
When Nana's consciousness
was transferred
into Abigail's body,

16:55.144 --> 16:57.755
her old ailments
transferred as well.

16:57.799 --> 17:02.456
So while her body's young,
her brains succumbed
to Nana's dementia.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.153
[Tabitha] Could you still
go into her mind

17:04.197 --> 17:06.112
and look for anything
she might know about Percival?

17:09.680 --> 17:12.118
Britta, we're going to sit
with Nana for bit.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.945
Do you think you could
brew us some tea?

17:20.474 --> 17:22.041
[breathing heavily]

17:25.131 --> 17:26.219
[cat meowing]

17:44.541 --> 17:45.412
[Tabitha] Anything?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.158
No, it's a lost cause.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.811
And there goes our best shot
to find out

17:53.855 --> 17:56.031
if Nana or any of the Blossoms
knew anything about Percival.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.728
Um, the tea's brewing.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.991
But in the meantime,
would you mind signing
these for me?

18:03.343 --> 18:04.518
The Superteens?

18:04.561 --> 18:06.128
I'm a huge fan.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.303
I mean, who isn't?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.262
I have multiple copies
of every issue.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.438
Whoa!

18:11.481 --> 18:14.136
[Tabitha] These must be written
by Rivervale's Jughead.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.746
Not the one in the bunker.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.227
The other one.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.316
Do these characters
look familiar to you?

18:20.360 --> 18:25.104
Yeah, and it looks
like their powers
correspond to ours back home.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.453
That can't be a coincidence.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.977
It's not. Jughead, look.

18:29.673 --> 18:32.154
Who is this again?

18:32.198 --> 18:33.242
[Rivervale Britta]
You're joking, right?

18:33.286 --> 18:36.115
That's the Superteens'
archnemesis.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.986
The mad wizard,
Percy the Perverse.

18:40.554 --> 18:41.729
Weird question.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.861
Do I still
do all of my writing at Pop's?

18:43.905 --> 18:46.734
Yeah, in your booth.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.301
It's kind of your thing.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.173
Thanks.

19:01.923 --> 19:06.319
Jay-Jay, it is sublime
to be together again
in companionable silence.

19:07.537 --> 19:11.150
But tell me,
are you happy to be back?

19:11.193 --> 19:13.239
I am.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.502
I'm so glad that I don't
have to fight in that war.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.722
What war?

19:18.766 --> 19:21.160
[knock at door]

19:21.203 --> 19:22.726
I know why Percival's
building the ghost train.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.254
Jay-Jay spilled the tea whilst
I was painting his portrait.

19:28.297 --> 19:31.344
Turns out
Percival's long-dead relation
General Augustus Pickens

19:31.387 --> 19:34.216
is going around the Sweet
Hereafter, drafting dead
strapping souls

19:34.260 --> 19:37.219
like my dear brother
to fight a war against
the living here in Riverdale.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.221
And Percival's using
the ghost train

19:39.265 --> 19:41.223
to ship them to Riverdale
so he can invade us.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.616
When does Jason think
this is going to happen?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.357
In advance
of Bailey's Comet's arrival.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.228
So then there's still time.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.578
-To do what?
-To build a bomb.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.407
So we can blow up
the train tracks
and stop Percival.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.930
[cell phone vibrating]

19:52.974 --> 19:54.323
It's Veronica.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.804
She may have dug up some intel
from the Babylonium.

19:56.847 --> 20:00.851
So Reggie, Kevin
and Mr. Mantle
are all prisoners of war?

20:00.895 --> 20:05.247
Exactly. And given the
three guillotines I spied
on the Babylonium stage,

20:05.291 --> 20:07.336
I suspect
they're going to be executed.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.946
Sooner rather than later

20:08.990 --> 20:11.471
if you blow up Percival's
precious train tracks.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.299
[sighs]

20:13.342 --> 20:15.431
Okay. So we need
to get them out first
and then blow up the tracks.

20:15.475 --> 20:18.434
[Veronica] I just don't think
that's going to be possible,
Archie.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.442
[creaking]

20:37.453 --> 20:39.107
-Hey.
-God!

20:39.150 --> 20:42.153
Are you okay?
How are you feeling?

20:42.197 --> 20:44.243
Definitely not
filled with grace.

20:45.679 --> 20:48.159
Betty, taking stock
of your life,

20:48.203 --> 20:49.335
what exactly
do you think you did

20:49.378 --> 20:51.206
that's so unforgivable?

20:53.904 --> 20:55.384
Okay. Where do I start?

20:55.428 --> 20:58.996
I killed our family cat
with a rock, Polly.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
You were eight.

21:00.563 --> 21:01.825
Caramel was suffering.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.914
Dad was influencing you.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.307
That doesn't make
you a bad person.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.440
So what else?

21:09.877 --> 21:14.360
I know it may sound stupid,
but I still feel awful

21:14.403 --> 21:16.492
about kissing Archie
in high school.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.974
I betrayed Jughead.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.454
I betrayed Veronica.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.544
I broke apart our friend group
right before graduation.

21:24.587 --> 21:28.504
That's definite Harlot
of Riverdale behavior,
if you ask me.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.941
Betty, that kiss doesn't
make you a harlot.

21:30.985 --> 21:34.205
Sorry. So liberate yourself
from that, too,

21:34.249 --> 21:40.211
But also forgive yourself
for falling out of love
with Jughead.

21:40.255 --> 21:44.215
That happens, and it doesn't
make you a bad person, either.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.479
So what else?

21:47.828 --> 21:49.264
Hmm?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.483
What aren't you telling me?

21:51.222 --> 21:52.876
[sighs]

21:52.920 --> 21:56.576
When Percival was coming at us
with those plagues,

21:56.619 --> 22:00.014
I gave myself a crash course
in all things biblical,

22:00.057 --> 22:03.713
including the Harlot
of Babylon,
but also Cain

22:05.454 --> 22:08.457
who was forever
marked by his sin.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.981
The mark of Cain.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.853
I am marked, Polly.

22:14.507 --> 22:17.423
I have been marked since birth.

22:18.554 --> 22:21.296
The MAOA gene.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
I wondered
if we'd circle back to that.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.432
I'm evil, Polly.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.653
It's written in my DNA.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.528
You may not think so,
but other people do.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.227
They've told me as much.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.141
You're the evil!

22:40.184 --> 22:41.534
You're the threat!

22:41.577 --> 22:44.406
You're a cold, fake,
duplicitous bitch.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.755
[man] You're one of us.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.540
An American psycho.

22:49.019 --> 22:52.458
Betty, I think I know
something that may help.

22:57.071 --> 23:01.249
Remember what Bunker Jughead
said would happen
if we confronted ourselves?

23:01.292 --> 23:04.426
Well, yeah, it would
be a catastrophe
if someone saw us together.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.081
Besides, what would I even say?

23:07.124 --> 23:10.084
"Hey, me.
Why do all my friends
have the same superpowers

23:10.127 --> 23:11.955
as the people you write
in your comic books?

23:11.999 --> 23:13.653
What are you, a wizard?

23:13.696 --> 23:15.524
Is everyone
in this universal wizard?"

23:15.568 --> 23:19.398
Okay. I have a crazy idea
for how we can get the other
Jughead alone.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.836
But we just need to wait for
Tabitha... Rivervale Tabitha
to take out the trash

23:22.879 --> 23:25.404
so that I can put her
in a time loop.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.667
Okay.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.365
Okay. You head
to our apartment.
Their apartment.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.628
I will get the other Jughead,
and we will meet you there.

23:34.543 --> 23:38.286
So tell me,
did you take the devil's deal?

23:38.329 --> 23:39.461
I did.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.550
After a little negotiation.

23:41.594 --> 23:46.337
You see, I managed to procure
from him my immortality
as well as my freedom.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.514
Ah, very clever.

23:48.557 --> 23:51.691
How can the devil claim
your soul if you never die?

23:51.734 --> 23:53.170
Exactly.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.608
I left Sweetwater Village
and spent the next 400 years

23:55.651 --> 23:59.133
going from town to town,
acquiring forbidden knowledge.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.657
Knowledge that I would use
to conquer or destroy

24:01.701 --> 24:04.094
the town of Rivervale
when I returned.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.574
Wait...

24:05.618 --> 24:07.707
Did you say Rivervale?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.186
But did you
mean Riverdale?

24:09.230 --> 24:10.840
No, Alice.
I meant Rivervale.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.495
Let me explain.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.932
So I was headed back to where
Sweetwater Village was founded

24:15.976 --> 24:18.544
to take my revenge
on the place
some 400 years later.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.328
And a curious thing happened.

24:22.591 --> 24:26.377
As I neared the town limits,
I heard the sound
of an explosion.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.423
[distant explosion]

24:28.467 --> 24:31.426
And then I noticed
the town sign,
whereas before it had said

24:31.470 --> 24:32.993
Rivervale plain as day,

24:33.036 --> 24:35.561
now I was being welcomed
to Riverdale.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.652
Something had
happened, Alice.

24:39.695 --> 24:42.742
I found myself
in a new universe.

24:42.785 --> 24:46.267
It seems that on my way back
to conquer Rivervale,

24:46.310 --> 24:49.662
I must have stepped through
a rift that had opened up.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.620
And so I found myself
in a different universe.

24:51.664 --> 24:56.320
This one where Rivervale
was called Riverdale.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.757
I am with you so far.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.672
Now, Riverdale was very
similar to my home universe,

24:59.715 --> 25:02.675
only seemingly devoid
of the supernatural.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.546
But I soon saw
an opportunity.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.895
You see, I realized

25:05.939 --> 25:09.203
I was the most powerful
being in this new place.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.683
I had magic
and immortality.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.554
No one else did.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.774
I also realized
that the descendants

25:14.817 --> 25:17.211
of my enemies
were still living here,
or at least versions of them.

25:17.254 --> 25:20.083
And they were caught up
in their petty squabbles,

25:20.127 --> 25:22.172
dramas, romances.

25:22.216 --> 25:25.045
-So your plan for revenge...
-Could still happen.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.917
And so I decided to stay.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.049
When no one knew me

25:29.092 --> 25:30.441
or what I was capable of.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.182
I tried to buy
Archie Andrews' house.

25:32.226 --> 25:35.969
I became a deputy,
joined the council,

25:36.012 --> 25:37.536
opened my shop.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.581
You wove yourself
into the fabric of Riverdale.

25:39.625 --> 25:44.673
And as I slowly took it over,
I began to sideline my enemies.

25:44.717 --> 25:48.416
But then,
another twist of fate.

25:48.459 --> 25:53.595
The descendants of my enemies
began developing gifts,
abilities, powers

25:58.513 --> 26:02.778
and while
this didn't dissuade me,
it did complicate matters.

26:02.822 --> 26:06.086
In any case, I focused
on building my ghost train

26:06.129 --> 26:09.480
in preparation
for the final battle
for Riverdale's soul.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.614
A battle I plan on winning.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.964
And why do you think

26:15.008 --> 26:17.706
that some people
in Riverdale have started
to develop these powers?

26:17.750 --> 26:22.711
Oh, gosh, I can only surmise
that as I slipped out
of Rivervale,

26:22.755 --> 26:25.105
some of its arcane energies
must have escaped

26:25.148 --> 26:27.716
through the fissures
between worlds with me.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.066
And these energies
seeped into Riverdale,

26:30.110 --> 26:33.635
infecting the townspeople,
changing some of them.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.724
You know,
water finds its level, Alice.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.639
Perhaps the universe wanted...

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
Well, if not a fair fight,

26:39.685 --> 26:41.730
at least a more equal one.

26:41.774 --> 26:42.992
It doesn't matter, though,

26:43.036 --> 26:44.864
I've had my powers
for centuries.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.909
They've had theirs
for weeks and months.

26:46.953 --> 26:50.565
Plus, with Bailey's Comet
arriving, I shall be
at my most potent.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.795
[Betty] Put your feet in.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.624
-Polly.
-Betty.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.061
Please.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.081
There.

27:28.124 --> 27:32.259
The MAOA gene
isn't there anymore.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.043
Your original sin is gone.

27:34.783 --> 27:36.263
Washed clean.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.221
-That's impossible.
You can't just--
-I did.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.484
It's gone.

27:40.528 --> 27:41.747
That marked part of you.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.271
It isn't there anymore.

27:44.314 --> 27:48.928
You're not the Harlot
of Babylon or Riverdale
or anywhere else.

27:53.454 --> 27:56.805
Polly, all you did
was wash my feet.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.633
As someone did for me

27:58.677 --> 28:00.853
before I walked
into the Sweet Hereafter.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.029
Now you can enter it, too.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.083
[Tabitha] Hey,
can you help me, please?

28:14.954 --> 28:15.868
Hello?

28:19.306 --> 28:20.699
Is someone there?

28:20.742 --> 28:22.048
[Tabitha] Yes.
I just need a second.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.275
[Tabitha] Hey.
Can you help me, please?

28:33.363 --> 28:34.277
Hello?

28:36.366 --> 28:37.716
Is someone there?

28:37.759 --> 28:38.717
[Tabitha] Yes.
I just need a second.

28:46.986 --> 28:50.293
Hey, can you take a break?

28:50.337 --> 28:52.731
Yeah. Where's your uniform?

28:53.906 --> 28:54.820
I'll explain everything.

28:56.343 --> 28:58.562
In private. At home.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.651
[Rivervale Jughead]
What's this all about?
You're kind of freaking me out.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.785
[Tabitha] Well, be prepared
to be even more freaked out.

29:03.829 --> 29:04.743
What are you talking about?

29:07.354 --> 29:08.659
Hey.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.792
Oh, my God.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.489
So, given everything,

29:12.533 --> 29:16.798
we believe that your comics
are directly or indirectly

29:16.842 --> 29:19.714
influencing actual events
in our world.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.455
Riverdale, where we are from.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.022
Me and my friends
have even...

29:23.065 --> 29:25.546
Well, we have superpowers,
like in your comics.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.417
I believe you.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.028
I believe in the multiverse.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.291
I believed in multiverses
since before it was cool.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.598
Can we ask
where you got your inspiration
for your comics?

29:34.642 --> 29:37.123
And for these specific powers?

29:37.166 --> 29:40.430
I felt like these powers
were good fits
for their characters.

29:40.474 --> 29:43.782
Like extensions of their
particular personalities.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.696
What about your villain?

29:45.740 --> 29:46.828
Percy the Perverse.

29:46.872 --> 29:47.786
Where did he come from?

29:49.048 --> 29:51.137
A recurring nightmare.

29:51.180 --> 29:54.009
Okay. How do the Superteens
defeat him?

29:55.315 --> 29:58.622
Well, as a matter of fact,
check this.

29:58.666 --> 30:03.062
-These are some rough pages
from my latest issue.
-[Tabitha] Oh.

30:03.105 --> 30:07.414
I call it
"Death of the Superteens."

30:07.457 --> 30:11.679
In the end,
after this epic battle,
Percy kills them all.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.420
Why?

30:13.463 --> 30:16.075
Why would you write something
so bleak and nihilistic?

30:16.118 --> 30:21.602
Well, honestly,
it was kind of a deal I made.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.431
I wanted to be the greatest
comic book writer in the world.

30:24.474 --> 30:27.956
Bigger than Alan Moore
even, and it worked.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.046
But in exchange,
and I was kind of tricked,

30:31.090 --> 30:35.921
but I agreed to only write
stories of a certain type.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.357
Grim ones.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.228
Ones that would ultimately...

30:39.272 --> 30:40.447
[clears throat]

30:40.490 --> 30:41.927
darken the world.

30:41.970 --> 30:46.888
What kind of person would offer
you a deal like this?

30:47.584 --> 30:49.717
A guy named Mr. Cypher.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.893
He's the devil, right?

30:52.763 --> 30:53.895
Uh...

30:53.939 --> 30:55.288
Yeah, basically.

30:55.331 --> 30:57.594
Jughead, my friend
in the Sweet Hereafter

30:57.638 --> 30:59.379
warned me about
someone named...

31:00.771 --> 31:01.685
Cypher.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.210
Where is Cypher now?

31:04.253 --> 31:09.389
I think he has
a suite at the Babylonium.

31:09.432 --> 31:12.740
Yeah, no, he's playing
in a chess tournament tonight.

31:12.783 --> 31:16.004
It's been called
the Ultimate Battle
of Good and Evil.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.210
[Jughead] Is that him?
Is that Mr. Cypher?

31:48.950 --> 31:51.170
I believe so.

31:51.213 --> 31:53.041
And I know
the man playing against him.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.390
That's my guardian angel.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.088
[Jughead] The personification
of good

31:56.131 --> 31:58.177
versus the personification
of evil.

31:58.220 --> 31:59.743
Well, I guess,
depending on who wins--

31:59.787 --> 32:00.962
[Mr. Cypher] Check.

32:01.571 --> 32:02.746
And mate.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.097
And we have a winner!

32:05.140 --> 32:07.926
Mr. Cypher is the winner!

32:07.969 --> 32:10.102
[all applauding]

32:10.145 --> 32:13.409
That is definitely
not a good sign.

32:13.453 --> 32:14.323
Uh-uh.

32:17.544 --> 32:20.373
The Superteens being defeated
by Percy the Perverse,

32:20.416 --> 32:23.071
my guardian angel
losing to Mr. Cypher.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.986
They're bad omens.
I agree.

32:25.030 --> 32:28.163
Good is losing the battle
against evil over
and over again.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.296
In the pages of a comic book,
in a chess game.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.994
But that doesn't mean
the same thing
is going to happen to us.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.430
Doesn't it?

32:34.474 --> 32:38.086
Events from Rivervale
are spilling into Riverdale.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.306
What's symbolic
and fictional here

32:40.349 --> 32:42.830
is becoming literal
and real back home.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.179
[door opens]

32:48.227 --> 32:49.315
You again.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.708
Look, we're not trying
to fight you.

32:51.752 --> 32:56.061
We are just here
to ask some questions,
and then we'll leave.

32:56.844 --> 32:57.976
Fine.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.501
Make it quick.

33:01.544 --> 33:05.200
Do you know someone
named Percival Pickens?

33:05.244 --> 33:08.029
And if so,
are you in cahoots with him?

33:09.770 --> 33:12.991
Percival was one of Rivervale's
founding fathers.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.081
Sold his soul
to me centuries ago.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.779
Well, he's wreaking havoc
in Riverdale.

33:18.822 --> 33:20.824
Riverdale?

33:20.868 --> 33:22.957
Is that where he's got to?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.220
Well, I lost track of him
a while back.

33:25.264 --> 33:29.007
He was wandering the country
becoming a great sorcerer.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.704
Slippery fellow, that one.

33:30.747 --> 33:33.011
Percival isn't the first person
who's tried to use the loophole

33:33.054 --> 33:37.406
of immortality to cheat his way
out of giving up his soul.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.887
Which always backfires,
by the way.

33:41.715 --> 33:44.196
But he is the first
to hide in another dimension.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.068
Which is irritating.

33:47.112 --> 33:51.203
Sorry. I can't get more
directly involved.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.118
Those are the cosmic rules.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.207
I do wish you luck.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.730
Though you're probably
going to lose.

33:56.773 --> 33:59.167
Oh, you're wrong.
We will find a way
to beat Percival.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.865
We already stymied
his attempt to destroy Pop's.

34:01.909 --> 34:05.217
We moved it,
so that the final battle
can still happen.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.306
[Mr. Cypher] Silly mortal.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.395
If only you knew the truth.

34:09.438 --> 34:10.396
Wait, what truth?

34:11.527 --> 34:13.007
Or I can keep
reading your mind.

34:14.226 --> 34:17.838
It's not the diner
that's important to Percival.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.405
It's the land.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.321
Why is that?

34:22.364 --> 34:24.714
That's where he was left to die
by those early settlers
centuries ago.

34:24.758 --> 34:27.195
It's where I came upon him
when we made our deal.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.330
It is also, in all realities,

34:31.373 --> 34:32.548
Rivervale, Riverdale,

34:32.592 --> 34:35.203
the sight of a hellmouth.

34:35.247 --> 34:38.380
In the old days, churches used
to be built over hellmouths

34:38.424 --> 34:42.080
to contain the dark forces
roiling beneath.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.169
Stifle them.

34:44.604 --> 34:45.866
Cap them.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.782
And that was... Pop's.

34:48.825 --> 34:53.134
And it sounds like
you've played right
into Percival's hands.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.137
And uncorked it
when you moved the diner.

34:56.181 --> 35:00.098
And like Bailey's Comet,
that's also adding
to his power.

35:00.141 --> 35:03.013
Please don't let me
keep you any longer.

35:03.362 --> 35:04.232
Come on.

35:08.889 --> 35:11.413
[Alice] Only a few more
questions, Mr. Mayor.

35:11.457 --> 35:15.809
Once this epic battle
of good versus evil is over,

35:15.852 --> 35:19.987
assuming that you win,
what does your Riverdale
look like?

35:20.030 --> 35:24.165
You know,
when we were coming over
from the old country,

35:24.209 --> 35:27.821
the men and women
aboard the Pearlwere talking
about hopes and dreams

35:27.864 --> 35:30.998
and a new beginning in a land
of freedom and opportunity,

35:31.041 --> 35:36.177
with workers' rights
and equal rights and good,
wholesome family values.

35:36.221 --> 35:40.007
Now, I kept quiet during these
discussions because I knew

35:40.050 --> 35:41.791
those things are lies.

35:41.835 --> 35:43.228
You see, given enough time,

35:43.271 --> 35:46.448
society always curdles,
rots, corrupts.

35:46.492 --> 35:49.016
I want a land that
I rule as I see fit.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.974
Where my enemies
are at my mercy.

35:51.018 --> 35:53.542
I want a land controlled
by the dark arts,

35:53.586 --> 35:57.111
free from the laws that stifle
the rest of this country.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.157
The Sovereign
State of Percival.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.941
That's what
I want Riverdale to be.

36:00.984 --> 36:05.075
A wild, untamed land
where I control it all,
every last bit.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.251
Even the dead.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.341
[chuckles]

36:10.255 --> 36:12.344
I'm sorry... it just...

36:13.258 --> 36:15.347
sounds so twisted, but...

36:16.696 --> 36:18.263
at least it's honest, eh?

36:18.306 --> 36:21.266
Speaking of which,
we have an execution to get to.

36:25.008 --> 36:27.402
[Rivervale Jughead] Look!
I told you they'd come back!

36:27.446 --> 36:29.970
You shouldn't have let
them out into the world
in the first place.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.363
Ethel?

36:31.406 --> 36:32.668
You know about this, too?

36:32.712 --> 36:34.104
Yes.

36:34.148 --> 36:36.368
And thank goodness someone
with sense does.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.283
When Riverdale
and Rivervale split,

36:38.326 --> 36:43.418
it was supposed to be
a clean break
between the universes.

36:43.462 --> 36:46.116
But clearly,
there's been a bleed.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.596
A lot of bleed.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.381
And how? Why?

36:49.424 --> 36:53.298
There has to be something
that's fouled things up,
that corrupted it.

36:53.341 --> 36:56.214
You were on the other side.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.651
Were you near the explosion
when it happened?

36:58.694 --> 37:00.000
Yeah, actually.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.958
I... Not as close
as Betty and Archie.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.221
Did they say anything?

37:04.526 --> 37:06.659
About anything
beyond the explosion?

37:06.702 --> 37:07.616
No, it was all...

37:10.663 --> 37:12.491
Actually, yeah. Betty...

37:12.534 --> 37:14.841
Betty said that
she received a phone call,

37:14.884 --> 37:17.104
like a warning
to get out of the bedroom.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.280
Hello?

37:19.324 --> 37:20.325
[distorted voice]
Get out of that house, Betty.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.197
Who is this?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.112
Listen to me.
There's a bomb
underneath the bed.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.156
You need to go now.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.332
Right now!

37:29.159 --> 37:30.770
[Rivervale Ethel]
I knew it!

37:30.813 --> 37:32.380
Oh!

37:32.424 --> 37:34.991
I knew you called her!

37:35.035 --> 37:37.080
You warned her,
didn't you?

37:37.124 --> 37:38.343
Damn it, Jughead!

37:38.386 --> 37:40.475
That's why
there wasn't a clean break!

37:40.519 --> 37:42.477
You called your ex-girlfriend!

37:42.521 --> 37:44.436
That's why there
are fissures!

37:44.479 --> 37:46.829
Rifts! Seepage
between universes!

37:46.873 --> 37:48.527
That's why
we have supernatural powers.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.485
And it's why Percival crossed
over from Rivervale.

37:50.529 --> 37:53.793
That phone call
compromised everything.

37:53.836 --> 37:58.014
And now the parallel universes
are influencing
each other again!

37:58.058 --> 38:01.409
God, you are
so weak, Jughead.

38:01.453 --> 38:05.413
And even now, even still,
you love Betty, right?

38:05.457 --> 38:06.936
And that's
why you called her.

38:06.980 --> 38:10.244
Even though it's over!
It's over, Jughead!

38:10.288 --> 38:11.593
I was trying to save her life!

38:12.594 --> 38:14.509
Her and Archie!

38:14.553 --> 38:15.641
Ethel, they're still
my best friends!

38:15.684 --> 38:17.425
Even if they're
in another universe.

38:17.469 --> 38:20.298
-We're just going to go.
-Yeah, you go, you go!

38:20.341 --> 38:21.690
And you.
[scoffs]

38:21.734 --> 38:24.606
Now it's my job
to clean everybody's mess.

38:24.650 --> 38:28.175
-Story of my life! I swear...
-[portal whooshing]

38:32.222 --> 38:34.050
-That was...
-Chilling.

38:34.094 --> 38:36.575
But we know a lot more
than we did
before we went there.

38:38.446 --> 38:39.491
We should update
everyone else.

38:42.537 --> 38:46.236
What about a spell, Cheryl,
or some incantation?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.413
Heather is looking through
all her grimoires right now,

38:48.456 --> 38:51.416
but so far she hasn't found
anything strong enough
to touch Percival.

38:51.459 --> 38:52.721
[door opens]

38:52.765 --> 38:54.506
We have intel.
About Percival.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.029
We know where
he comes from.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.291
We know how
he got his powers.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.684
We know how
we got our powers.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.644
What's going on here?

39:02.688 --> 39:05.212
What happened?
What did we miss?

39:05.255 --> 39:09.695
Kevin, Reggie and Mr. Mantle
are being held hostage
at the Babylonium.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.350
They're going to be executed.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.483
I think I can help with that.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.797
[crackling]

39:29.932 --> 39:31.238
Jughead, what the hell?

39:31.281 --> 39:32.413
I heard you guys
were in trouble.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.372
Came to save you.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.547
Come on, let's go.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.341
[Veronica] Archie,
the prisoners are out.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.430
We're in the clear.
We are good
to blow the train tracks.

39:52.694 --> 39:53.565
[beeping]

39:55.262 --> 39:57.395
[explosion]

40:05.403 --> 40:06.491
[cell phone chimes]

40:08.754 --> 40:09.668
I don't understand.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.845
This is impossible.
Where did they go?

40:14.542 --> 40:16.414
Boss, we have
another problem.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.505
Someone blew up
the train tracks.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.641
My only regret is that
we didn't get to see his face

40:26.685 --> 40:29.514
when he opened the vault
and saw we weren't there.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.777
Damn. Saved by
Donnie Darko.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.909
-Thanks, bro.
-Yeah, of course.

40:33.953 --> 40:37.391
The prisoners are freed,
the tracks for the ghost train
are decimated.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.045
I mean,
today was an excellent day.

40:39.088 --> 40:41.177
For sure, but those
were only skirmishes.

40:41.221 --> 40:42.701
The real war
hasn't even started yet.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.878
And we still don't know
what that's even
gonna look like.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.619
But thanks to you and Jug,

40:47.662 --> 40:50.012
we know a lot more
than we did ten hours ago.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.493
And we have a better idea
of what to get done
before Bailey's Comet--

40:52.537 --> 40:53.668
[cell phones chiming]

40:57.237 --> 40:58.630
What's this?

40:58.673 --> 41:00.632
A group text.
And it's not from moi?

41:03.548 --> 41:04.679
What are we looking at here?

41:08.030 --> 41:10.859
Those are the guillotines I saw
at the Babylonium.

41:10.903 --> 41:13.645
-Wait. But who are--
-That's my mom.

41:14.776 --> 41:16.778
-And Uncle Frank.
-And my dad.

41:19.738 --> 41:21.609
[cell phones chiming]

41:21.653 --> 41:23.263
"Let it be known
that at midnight tonight,

41:23.306 --> 41:25.308
the political dissidents
Alice Cooper, Thomas Keller

41:25.352 --> 41:29.530
and Frank Andrews were executed
for their treasonous crimes

41:29.574 --> 41:31.706
against the township
of Riverdale."

41:31.750 --> 41:34.143
No, no, no, no.
He's... he's lying.

41:34.187 --> 41:36.537
That's It's a trick.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.713
It's a mind game.
Okay, that can't be real.

41:38.757 --> 41:42.021
[Jughead] But it was.
Archie was wrong.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.763
The war had,
in fact, already started.

41:44.806 --> 41:47.505
And Percival
had drawn first blood.
