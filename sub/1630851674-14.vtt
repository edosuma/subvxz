25:13.990 --> 25:17.167
for a life.
How is that possible? [laughs]

25:17.298 --> 25:18.691
Well, it's possible
because of everything

25:18.821 --> 25:20.127
that you've done
for this family.

25:20.257 --> 25:22.521
Thank you. Speaking of which...

25:22.651 --> 25:25.872
Here, from Ash.

25:29.397 --> 25:32.618
He's recuperating
from surgery in Tahiti?

25:32.748 --> 25:34.445
Yeah. More like,
um, celebrating,

25:34.576 --> 25:36.186
given the obscene details

25:36.317 --> 25:37.753
he goes into. Look.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.061
[chuckles]

25:42.932 --> 25:44.455
You think this trip
is his way of ghosting,

25:44.586 --> 25:46.762
now that he's better?

25:46.893 --> 25:49.852
I don't know, but he can't
vanish if you stay on his tail.

25:54.465 --> 25:55.945
[sighs]

25:58.339 --> 26:00.167
[knock on door]

26:00.297 --> 26:01.908
You text.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.040
[cell phone keyboard clicking]

26:07.783 --> 26:09.132
It's Sonny.

26:09.263 --> 26:12.048
-Hey, Sonny. Come in.
-SONNY: Hey. Uh...

26:12.179 --> 26:14.181
I-I went by the hospital,
but they said, uh,

26:14.311 --> 26:15.530
you guys got to come home, so...

26:15.661 --> 26:17.140
-Yeah.
-Congratulations.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.490
-STELLA: Thank you.
-SONNY: Yeah.

26:19.621 --> 26:20.883
What do you want?

26:21.014 --> 26:22.232
Uh...

26:22.363 --> 26:23.669
You know what,
why don't I just...

26:23.799 --> 26:25.105
I'll give you a chance
to-to catch....

26:25.235 --> 26:26.323
No, no. I'd like for you
to be here, too, Stella.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.369
I-I came to actually apologize.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.892
-Um...
-For what?

26:30.023 --> 26:32.460
Well, um...

26:32.591 --> 26:35.289
I've been a real ass clown
as-as of late, and, um,

26:35.419 --> 26:37.944
my selfishness down in Colombia

26:38.074 --> 26:40.120
nearly jeopardized
this beautiful family of yours.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.991
You know, I guess, uh,

26:42.122 --> 26:43.993
I was jealous

26:44.124 --> 26:46.909
that you had what I'd lost,
and I took it out on my...

26:47.040 --> 26:48.824
my best friend,

26:48.955 --> 26:50.652
despite how
ass-backwards that sounds.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.437
You see, if-if my brain
was a duck,

26:53.568 --> 26:55.091
it'd fly north for the winter.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.702
[chuckles]

26:56.832 --> 26:59.661
[stammers] I actually, uh,
I brought, um,

26:59.792 --> 27:01.663
this, uh...

27:01.794 --> 27:03.839
What do you got?

27:03.970 --> 27:05.711
-It's a peace offering. Um...
-[chuckles]

27:05.841 --> 27:08.148
It's just a bunch of
Leanne's old stuff, you know...

27:08.278 --> 27:09.889
What are you doing?

27:10.019 --> 27:11.717
-Some bibs and onesies and...
-No, no, no, we can't.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.719
-...burp cloths and stuff.
-This is too much, Sonny.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.024
We can't take

27:15.155 --> 27:16.547
-all this stuff from you.
-No, trust me,

27:16.678 --> 27:18.071
you-you're gonna need it, okay?
[chuckles]

27:18.201 --> 27:19.638
You know, two is one
and one is none, right?

27:21.204 --> 27:24.164
Plus, I was kind of
running out of space.

27:24.294 --> 27:26.427
But let's focus
on my generosity and, uh,

27:26.557 --> 27:28.821
not my ulterior motive.

27:28.951 --> 27:32.433
I'm really sorry that Leanne
and Hannah moved back to Texas.

27:32.563 --> 27:33.913
Yeah. Don't cry for me,

27:34.043 --> 27:36.176
Stella-tina. You see,
I have a daughter

27:36.306 --> 27:40.049
that I love, brothers that
I would die for, and...

27:40.180 --> 27:42.791
the best battle boo
I could ask for in Clay.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.055
Oh, um...

27:47.883 --> 27:49.450
-Here.
-STELLA: What is this?

27:49.580 --> 27:52.192
It's, uh...
The minivan, it's yours.

27:52.322 --> 27:53.672
STELLA: What?
No, no, no, no. We cannot

27:53.802 --> 27:54.977
accept such an expensive gift

27:55.108 --> 27:56.239
-from you, Sonny.
-No.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.806
-Seriously.
-[Stella chuckles]

27:57.937 --> 28:00.722
Look, this is a,
this is a perfect family van

28:00.853 --> 28:03.159
for a perfect family.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.988
Look, man, we-we appreciate
the offer, but we can't accept.

28:11.341 --> 28:13.387
Okay.

28:13.517 --> 28:14.431
But thank you.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.391
Really, thank you so much.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.392
Uh...

28:18.522 --> 28:20.786
I hope you, uh...

28:20.916 --> 28:24.006
hope you enjoy the time
with your son.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.885
He seems really torn up.

28:33.015 --> 28:36.540
He should be.

28:36.671 --> 28:39.543
I wouldn't respect myself
if I let him off the hook.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.157
So, we're gonna be
teaching Brian that, uh,

28:44.287 --> 28:46.289
forgiveness is weakness?

28:55.995 --> 28:58.693
[knock on door]

28:58.824 --> 29:01.348
[sighs] Okay.

29:01.478 --> 29:03.393
I know.

29:03.524 --> 29:06.396
[sighs] Come on. Em, told you,

29:06.527 --> 29:09.095
you don't have to knock,
just come on in.

29:11.793 --> 29:12.881
MANDY:
Hey.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.492
Hey.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.625
You drove all this way.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.366
That means you like me.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.108
Slow your roll.
I've got a question.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.153
Could've called with a question.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.113
Interrogations are
more effective in person.

29:27.243 --> 29:29.593
Right.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.900
Come on in.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.780
Been in hooches in J-Bad
with more charm.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.871
Right. So, what's your question?

29:48.177 --> 29:51.093
What damage were you talking
about at my place?

29:51.224 --> 29:54.140
[sighs] My head, mostly.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.532
TBI.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.406
I'm, uh...

29:59.536 --> 30:02.496
I'm looking into all the, uh,

30:02.626 --> 30:04.977
treatment options
that are out there right now.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.241
Jesus, Jason.

30:10.286 --> 30:13.420
-That's why you pulled away?
-There's that.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.596
And all the terrible shit
that I've seen and done

30:15.726 --> 30:18.077
during this terrible war
had me thinking

30:18.207 --> 30:20.731
I didn't deserve
happily ever after.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.559
And now?

30:22.690 --> 30:25.258
Maybe being with you is...

30:26.868 --> 30:29.828
...my reward for all
the blood and the trauma.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.701
You should've used
that line on my doorstep.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.225
Yeah, well, you were rushing me.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.706
[laughs]

30:44.755 --> 30:46.105
[cell phone buzzing]

30:48.542 --> 30:50.587
You got to be kidding me.
Every time.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.981
-[laughs]
-Every time.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.940
It's okay. Go, go, go.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.942
-[groans]
-Go to 'em.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.596
-Plenty of time for us.
-Yeah.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.036
[Jason groans]

31:04.166 --> 31:06.081
Barely kicked our feet up

31:06.212 --> 31:07.430
and Command has us
rolling out again?

31:07.561 --> 31:09.563
Well, apologies
for the quick turnaround,

31:09.693 --> 31:12.435
but all other assets
are either deployed

31:12.566 --> 31:13.915
or down with injury.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.525
CLAY:
No need to apologize.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.223
We live to serve, sir.

31:17.353 --> 31:18.789
[laughter]

31:18.920 --> 31:22.054
Your target... is Abul Alid.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.839
DAVIS: Alid's been rising
in the SGS ranks

31:24.970 --> 31:27.668
since we put a dent in their
leadership back in Burkina Faso.

31:27.798 --> 31:30.627
He'll be attending
a high-level meeting with ISIS

31:30.758 --> 31:32.325
in Mali.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.718
Bravo will fly to Burkina Faso,

31:34.849 --> 31:37.025
rendezvous with
two Ground Branch straps,

31:37.156 --> 31:40.420
and then drive two
up-armored SUVs north to Mali,

31:40.550 --> 31:42.074
where you are to capture Alid.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.467
If you're able to pull
actionable intel from him,

31:44.598 --> 31:45.947
expect follow-ons.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.210
So we might be there
longer than this op?

31:48.341 --> 31:49.864
Affirmative.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.519
Still a whole lot of mess
to clean up over there,

31:52.649 --> 31:54.869
so plan accordingly.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.480
Wheels up 1200 tomorrow.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.004
No rest for the weary.

31:59.134 --> 32:02.355
-War on terror.
-ALL: War on terror.

32:10.363 --> 32:13.061
Oh, hey, there. I, uh, take it
your presence in the warno

32:13.192 --> 32:14.802
means you survived the trip
to the head shed.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.413
Well, it wasn't
what I thought, so...

32:17.544 --> 32:19.154
you guys are stuck with me,
after all.

32:19.285 --> 32:22.157
[laughs] All that stress
over a piece of paper,

32:22.288 --> 32:23.811
and you just got a little
slap on the wrist, huh?

32:23.942 --> 32:25.900
It was more like
a pat on the back.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.468
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. I mean,

32:28.598 --> 32:31.210
this captain totally got it. All
the issues that I pointed out,

32:31.340 --> 32:33.647
he wants to fix them.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.954
Wow. I'm proud of you.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.913
A-And I'm-I'm-I'm sure
Grant is...

32:39.044 --> 32:40.132
is proud of you, too.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.743
Yeah, no, he will be,

32:42.873 --> 32:44.484
but I wanted to tell you first,

32:44.614 --> 32:47.226
since you listened to me
whine about it in Colombia.

32:48.836 --> 32:51.578
Well, um...

32:51.708 --> 32:54.450
thanks to you,
the only thing that went nuclear

32:54.581 --> 32:56.975
in South America was... was me.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.977
Um...

32:59.107 --> 33:02.241
Davis, I should've never blamed
you for Hannah leaving me.

33:05.418 --> 33:08.029
I'm sorry it didn't work out
for you two.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.859
Hmm. You can't force something
if you don't feel it.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.295
And I might not have all

33:13.426 --> 33:16.298
the things I love in my life,

33:16.429 --> 33:18.561
but two out of three
ain't bad, right?

33:20.302 --> 33:23.653
Look, I'm, you know,
and-and, um...

33:23.784 --> 33:26.265
I'm just really glad that

33:26.395 --> 33:28.093
you're watching
over us on this op.

33:28.223 --> 33:31.052
You know, it just kind of
brings you comfort.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.098
Well, I'll be watching
from here.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.970
Well, whose ear am I gonna
bend on the flight, then?

33:36.101 --> 33:38.494
I wish that was
my biggest concern.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.757
Got some reservations
on this one?

33:40.888 --> 33:42.585
The risk outweighs the reward.

33:42.716 --> 33:45.327
We take Alid
off the battlefield,

33:45.458 --> 33:47.503
he'll be replaced
the very same day.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.070
Hmm.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.551
I've come to learn
in life that...

33:51.681 --> 33:53.466
most things are replaceable...

33:57.035 --> 33:59.472
...but not everything.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.785
Or everyone.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.100
Just promise me you're not
going to Burkina Faso

34:19.231 --> 34:21.363
to rescue another
damsel in distress.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.409
Yeah, pretty sure it was
this damsel in distress

34:23.539 --> 34:25.802
who saved me from getting
carved up in the first place.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.892
Well, that was only
protecting body parts

34:29.023 --> 34:30.503
that are incredibly
valuable to me.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.505
All right.

34:32.635 --> 34:34.768
Thanks for going to dinner
with Brad and Emma.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.987
I'm sure it's not
what you wanted to do.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.598
Oh, I loved it.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.035
Emma's so welcoming.

34:41.166 --> 34:44.082
Only wish everyone else was.

34:44.212 --> 34:45.822
JASON:
Well, you know,

34:45.953 --> 34:47.389
Cerby's just a little salty

34:47.520 --> 34:49.261
because he's not the top dog
in bed anymore.

34:49.391 --> 34:52.264
[laughs] I'll make sure that,

34:52.394 --> 34:54.744
when you come back, the two
of you are on the same page.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.791
That is,
if you want to come back.

34:57.921 --> 35:00.968
I'm not going anywhere.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.579
-That works for me.
-Well, because

35:03.710 --> 35:06.104
traffic back to D.C.
at this hour is...

35:06.234 --> 35:07.453
I'd be crazy...

35:07.583 --> 35:08.541
You're fucking with me,

35:08.671 --> 35:09.672
-aren't you?
-[laughs]

35:12.806 --> 35:16.505
-I'm exactly where I want to be.
-Mm-hmm.

35:21.249 --> 35:24.557
I'm bummed I'm gonna miss
your shower.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.863
Months ago, you pushed back
on a coed baby shower,

35:26.994 --> 35:28.778
now you want in?

35:28.909 --> 35:32.130
I'm just trying to figure out
this work-life balance.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.264
You'll find it.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.440
Just remember,
Jason outside the wire,

35:38.571 --> 35:40.225
and Ray inside.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.185
[sighs]

35:44.316 --> 35:46.970
All that went down
in Colombia and...

35:47.101 --> 35:50.409
Brian coming early,
I'm thinking that plan maybe...

35:50.539 --> 35:52.541
maybe needs a little adjusting.

35:52.672 --> 35:55.240
Meaning what?

35:55.370 --> 35:58.939
Meaning I'm gonna find a way
to put this family first.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.479
-[sighs]
-I mean it.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.264
I know you do.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.006
-I love you.
-I love you.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.277
I love you, baby.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.220
