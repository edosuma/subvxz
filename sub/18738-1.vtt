00:34.367 --> 00:35.267
- No! No!

00:37.771 --> 00:38.837
No! Oh! Ahh!

01:27.087 --> 01:28.220
- Ah!

01:35.228 --> 01:36.662
- No!

01:36.664 --> 01:37.629
- Hey, mom.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.665
Mom?

01:41.601 --> 01:42.801
Mom?

01:42.803 --> 01:45.204
Mom, oh my god, mom!

02:21.074 --> 02:23.275
- Thanks for coming.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.543
They're frying me
in the morning,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.278
so my time is short.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.350
- What is it you need from me

02:31.352 --> 02:32.951
at this late hour?

02:32.953 --> 02:32.951
Salvation?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.355
- I'll take that up
with the almighty

02:36.357 --> 02:38.423
when I see him tomorrow.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.528
I need to tell you...

02:44.130 --> 02:46.198
- Tell me what, Charles?

02:47.767 --> 02:51.170
- Something made me
kill my family.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.504
Something evil.

02:54.407 --> 02:58.143
And it was something i
brought home with me.

02:59.779 --> 03:03.282
- Many things drive
people to do what they do.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.517
I'm not here to judge you.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.922
- It was something evil.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.957
I'm a contractor by trade and

03:11.959 --> 03:14.026
I worked at that house.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.929
You know, the famous one?

03:16.931 --> 03:19.064
The haunted one?

03:19.066 --> 03:21.900
- That house has been cleansed
for years.

03:21.902 --> 03:26.972
The current owners haven't
reported any phenomenon.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.708
- I was there before
all that hub bub.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.410
Before the priest
was killed exorcising

03:31.412 --> 03:33.045
the demons from it?

03:34.547 --> 03:35.447
- Yes.

03:36.249 --> 03:39.218
I'm familiar with the incident.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.986
Very familiar.

03:40.988 --> 03:41.887
- Ah!

03:45.792 --> 03:50.128
- I was there for weeks,
renovating a room.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.431
When I left, I took some
of the original lumber

03:52.433 --> 03:54.499
with me for another project.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.641
And that's when it took me over,

04:02.643 --> 04:06.044
when I brought
the materials home.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.947
I should have left them
in that accursed place.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.083
- You took the lumber home

04:11.085 --> 04:13.685
and that's when you
say you were possessed?

04:13.687 --> 04:17.122
- Dammit, I'm not saying, I was,

04:17.124 --> 04:19.291
and that's why
i want you to know,

04:19.293 --> 04:19.291
so you can go
to the last place that

04:19.293 --> 04:24.763
I worked and help those
people if they need it.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.031
I don't want anyone
going through

04:26.033 --> 04:28.767
the hell that I've gone through.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.982
Oh, for god's sake, say
something.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.386
Time's up, father.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.897
- Evil moves
just like people do.

05:01.534 --> 05:02.601
- Thank you.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.806
Maybe in some small way
I've redeemed myself.

05:09.108 --> 05:13.078
- Maybe you have, my son,
maybe you have.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.985
- Maybe I'll see ya
up there.

05:19.987 --> 05:20.952
- Possibly.

05:22.422 --> 05:23.422
Good night.

09:45.017 --> 09:45.917
- Ah!

10:12.211 --> 10:14.079
- I don't like
that kid!

10:14.081 --> 10:16.381
- You don't like
any of my friends.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.983
- I don't like him!

10:17.985 --> 10:19.250
He's your boyfriend, right?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.986
- You
think every guy I talk to

10:20.988 --> 10:22.287
is my boyfriend.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.389
We're friends, that's it.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.057
- You better watch it, missy.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.793
- You're just jealous because
you don't have any friends.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.828
- Watch it.

10:29.830 --> 10:29.828
- It's true.

10:29.830 --> 10:34.566
Who'd wanna be friends
with a, a stinking drunk?

10:34.568 --> 10:36.635
That's right,
go ahead and hit me

10:36.637 --> 10:39.404
like you did to mom when
she got on your case.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.225
- Hello?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.494
- Hey, robby.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.629
- Amy, how's it goin'?

11:04.631 --> 11:05.930
- Not too good.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.199
- Oh, boy.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.868
Another fight with your dad?

11:09.870 --> 11:12.504
- Yeah, this time a bad one.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.240
- Okay, tell me about it.

11:15.242 --> 11:19.778
- He's just always on my
case about everything.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.313
And he started
drinking heavily again.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.549
- He didn't hit you again?

11:25.418 --> 11:27.686
- No, not this time.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.155
But he was mad enough
that he could have.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.890
I wish he were dead.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.459
- You don't mean that.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.527
- Yes, I do.

11:36.295 --> 11:39.130
The world would be
a better place.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.466
And I'd be better off, too.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.103
- I'm sorry.

11:46.739 --> 11:47.639
- Thanks.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.029
- The evil must be ridden
from the house.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.031
It's the only way.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.200
- To exorcise a house?

13:22.202 --> 13:26.104
It goes against our
vows, the church and god.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.939
- Fighting Satan and his legion
of evil

13:27.941 --> 13:30.608
is what we're called for.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.344
You can hide behind
the laws of the church,

13:33.346 --> 13:35.680
but this evil is a reality.

13:37.349 --> 13:39.384
What men of god are we
if we don't,

13:39.386 --> 13:42.053
in good faith, try and stop it?

13:43.622 --> 13:46.357
- Please brother, I beg you, no.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.093
- Then I'll do it myself.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.095
- You need permission
from the church!

13:51.097 --> 13:53.531
- I have permission from god.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.433
Are you with me or not?

13:55.435 --> 13:56.734
- I can't.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.303
You can't.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.872
- Someone has to do something.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.674
This can't go on.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.876
The lives that this darkness
has destroyed

14:04.878 --> 14:06.878
is only gonna multiply!

14:08.647 --> 14:09.547
- I can't.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.549
I'm sorry.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.951
God be with you.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.554
- God be with you.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.927
- I warned you to stay away.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.462
- No!

15:33.099 --> 15:34.399
- Who's there?

15:48.180 --> 15:49.080
Hello?

15:50.916 --> 15:51.816
Dad?

15:53.319 --> 15:54.385
Is that you?

16:44.703 --> 16:45.603
Figures.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.088
I know there's someone in here.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.066
Who the hell is down here?

17:52.137 --> 17:53.538
I can't see you,

17:55.340 --> 17:57.008
but I can hear you.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.279
Ah!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.289
- What's going on?

18:45.291 --> 18:48.159
- I heard a voice and so
i followed it down here

18:48.161 --> 18:49.994
and then I saw
something terrible!

18:49.996 --> 18:52.163
- Alright, alright,
it's alright.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.599
There's nothing
going on here now.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.967
Are you sure you weren't
daydreaming?

18:55.969 --> 18:57.568
- No.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.971
I don't, I don't think so.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.539
No.

19:01.541 --> 19:01.539
- Okay, alright.

19:01.541 --> 19:06.544
Everything's alright,
everything'll be okay.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.681
- This wood, this lumber,
where did it come from?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.151
- That's just left over.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.454
Scraps from the floor
renovations, why?

19:18.357 --> 19:19.690
- I don't know.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.660
- Enough of this, come on.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.896
I'll fix us some dinner.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.489
- Yeah, that'll fit the bill.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.292
Side door, easy access.

20:32.664 --> 20:36.734
Looks like a nice,
white-bread, mid-class joint.

21:59.051 --> 21:59.917
- Boo!

21:59.919 --> 22:01.352
- Goddammit!

22:01.354 --> 22:03.454
What are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

22:03.456 --> 22:05.089
- I just stopped by to see Amy.

22:05.091 --> 22:05.990
Mind?

22:06.892 --> 22:09.694
- I guess not,
she's in the pool.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.463
Stupid kid.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.174
- Hey, what are you doing here?

22:23.176 --> 22:24.508
- Just thought I'd stop by
and visit.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.710
Mind?

22:25.712 --> 22:26.544
- No.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.112
But my dad won't be happy.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.114
- I just startled him.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.283
- He just hasn't
been himself lately.

22:32.285 --> 22:34.885
- Oh, he'll get over it.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.420
Parents.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.289
- Hey, could you chill here
a minute?

22:38.291 --> 22:39.724
I'm gonna go do some laps.

22:39.726 --> 22:40.891
- Sure thing.

23:10.455 --> 23:11.355
Ah!

23:42.555 --> 23:44.688
- Hey, are you okay?

23:44.690 --> 23:46.690
Did you swallow some water?

23:46.692 --> 23:48.826
- Didn't you see or hear?

23:49.761 --> 23:52.797
- You just swam a couple
laps and came back.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.698
- Something pulled me!

23:56.201 --> 23:57.668
- Dinner's ready.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.603
Hello?

24:32.605 --> 24:32.603
- Hello.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.739
It's urgent I speak
with Jeremy dukane.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.141
This is father benna.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.242
- This is him.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.510
What do you want?

24:39.512 --> 24:42.780
Why are you church folks always
trying to solicit people?

24:42.782 --> 24:43.948
- You don't understand.

24:43.950 --> 24:44.915
This has to do with your--

24:44.917 --> 24:48.052
- whatever it is,
I'm not interested.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.225
- Who was that?

24:54.227 --> 24:57.561
- Some religious nut trying
to solicit money or something.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.530
- And you don't believe
in charity?

24:59.532 --> 25:00.698
- Yeah, mine.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.206
- Amy.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.175
You still freaked out
by the pool?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.511
- What about the pool?

25:13.513 --> 25:15.079
- Uh, something...

25:18.216 --> 25:20.651
I just got caught in something.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.720
- I have to check the
suction on the filter.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.789
Might be high and you got
caught in the backflow.

25:25.791 --> 25:28.392
- No, it wasn't that, it was...

25:36.468 --> 25:38.536
It was nothing, I guess.

25:41.439 --> 25:44.475
- So, robby,
did you get a job yet?

25:44.477 --> 25:45.776
Or are you gonna
waste away the summer?

25:45.778 --> 25:47.378
- No.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.647
I have a job working at
my dad's hardware store

25:49.649 --> 25:51.282
and I'm gonna save up money
for college.

25:51.284 --> 25:52.650
- Great.

25:52.652 --> 25:55.653
Education is a terrible thing
to waste.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.989
- Well, speaking of work,
i gotta get going.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.224
See ya 'round.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.261
- I'll walk with you.

26:05.697 --> 26:08.265
- You, you gonna be okay?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.433
- Yeah, fine.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.469
Call me later?

26:12.471 --> 26:14.872
- Yeah, you can count on it.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.396
- Business time.

29:49.687 --> 29:50.921
What the hell?

32:28.813 --> 32:29.713
- Amy?

32:40.925 --> 32:42.326
Amy, what is it?

33:29.541 --> 33:31.842
- In the name of god,
who are you?

33:31.844 --> 33:34.311
- You are foolish,
like your brother.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.746
Stop your folly now,

33:35.748 --> 33:37.814
or suffer the torments of hell.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.116
- Never! Never!

33:40.351 --> 33:43.353
I plan on finishing
what my brother started.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.923
- You have determination,
but it won't be enough.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.258
We are many.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.860
We are powerful.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.461
We are forever.

33:51.463 --> 33:54.831
- And I have the strength
and blood of the almighty!

33:54.833 --> 33:56.366
- Do not challenge me with your

33:56.368 --> 33:58.702
pious traditions and beliefs.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.270
We have a great work to finish

34:00.272 --> 34:02.372
and you will not interfere!

34:02.374 --> 34:05.909
- The only thing
i have to finish is you!

34:05.911 --> 34:07.844
What is your name?

34:07.846 --> 34:09.746
I command you!

34:13.819 --> 34:14.717
Your name!

34:26.331 --> 34:30.000
- Hey, what's going on
in there?

34:40.777 --> 34:42.344
- Hey, Amy.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.313
Uh, how's it going?

34:44.315 --> 34:46.315
- Fine, robby, and you?

34:48.553 --> 34:52.522
- Uh, well, um my dad needs
me to work this afternoon,

34:52.524 --> 34:55.257
so I won't be able to come over.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.493
Maybe tonight?

34:57.328 --> 34:58.995
- We'll see, robby.

35:00.698 --> 35:01.765
We will see.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.236
- Are uh, are you okay?

35:07.305 --> 35:09.439
Sound a little different.

35:10.374 --> 35:11.908
- Tired.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.477
Just tired, robby.

35:15.179 --> 35:17.747
- Your dad hasn't been
hassling you again, has he?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.216
- No.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.550
He's somewhere.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.286
Maybe outside.

35:24.322 --> 35:25.455
- Well, okay.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.959
Sounds like you're eating lunch?

35:28.961 --> 35:30.861
- A snack, that's all.

35:32.497 --> 35:33.997
Talk to ya later.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.422
- Where do you think
you're going?

35:59.424 --> 36:01.224
- For a walk.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.692
- Help me out, first.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.427
- I don't have time.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.197
- What did you say?

36:15.306 --> 36:17.707
You don't be long now, hear?

37:21.038 --> 37:22.539
Can I help you?

37:22.541 --> 37:24.774
- Mr. Jeremy dukane?

37:24.776 --> 37:26.142
- Yah, that's me.

37:26.144 --> 37:27.711
- We need to talk.

37:30.314 --> 37:33.149
- You called me yesterday,
didn't you?

37:33.151 --> 37:35.585
- Yes, I was trying to warn you.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.786
- Warn me?

37:36.788 --> 37:38.455
About what?

37:38.457 --> 37:41.224
- You and your family
may be in great danger.

37:41.226 --> 37:42.125
- How so?

37:43.394 --> 37:45.862
- Have you noticed
anything strange going on,

37:45.864 --> 37:48.765
with your family or yourself?

37:48.767 --> 37:52.435
- It's only my daughter
and I who live here.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.837
My wife is gone.

37:56.641 --> 37:59.709
- Anything at all
out of the ordinary?

37:59.711 --> 38:02.078
- What business is it of yours?

38:02.080 --> 38:04.547
- So, there have been issues?

38:05.783 --> 38:08.852
- My daughter acts a
little weird sometimes,

38:08.854 --> 38:10.854
but it's just kid stuff, though.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.088
- Interesting.

38:12.090 --> 38:12.989
Recently?

38:14.091 --> 38:15.959
- In the last few days.

38:15.961 --> 38:16.860
Why?

38:17.862 --> 38:21.364
- Does the name Charles humes
ring a bell?

38:21.366 --> 38:25.001
- Yeah, he did some work
on the floors.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.569
Bad luck about

38:26.571 --> 38:28.905
his murdering his wife
and daughters.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.781
Seemed perfectly normal to me.

38:37.783 --> 38:41.651
- Most people are until
they become possessed.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.719
- Possessed?

38:43.587 --> 38:46.056
What are you getting at?

38:46.058 --> 38:49.359
- Charles worked on the
original amityville house.

38:49.361 --> 38:50.360
- So what?

38:50.362 --> 38:52.696
Those stories are crap.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.064
There's a family who lives
in there now

38:54.066 --> 38:56.399
who seems perfectly happy.

38:56.401 --> 39:00.070
There's no media sensations
about ghosts or goblins.

39:00.072 --> 39:03.106
- That's because my brother
exorcised the house,

39:03.108 --> 39:05.675
before he was thrown from
the window and killed.

39:05.677 --> 39:06.576
- Ah!

39:08.213 --> 39:11.915
- I heard about that accident
a while ago.

39:11.917 --> 39:12.816
I'm sorry.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.785
But what does this have to do
with me?

39:15.787 --> 39:17.320
My house?

39:17.322 --> 39:19.889
- Charles did work
on your floors.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.591
He took lumber
from the amityville house

39:21.593 --> 39:24.327
and used it on your renovations.

39:25.529 --> 39:26.363
- So?

39:26.365 --> 39:28.665
Good lumber is hard to find.

39:28.667 --> 39:32.302
- Have you ever heard
of evil transference?

39:33.437 --> 39:35.038
Let's go inside.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.774
We'll discuss it in more detail.

40:22.987 --> 40:25.555
Did you have a party recently?

40:26.957 --> 40:29.125
- Yeah, me, myself and I.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.330
- Thanks for the coffee.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.999
Now, as I was saying,

40:36.001 --> 40:38.134
evil transference.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.769
- Yeah, what is it?

40:41.005 --> 40:43.473
What does it have to do with me?

40:43.475 --> 40:46.176
- I strongly sense and
believe that the evil

40:46.178 --> 40:48.378
in that house attached
itself to the materials

40:48.380 --> 40:52.015
brought here and could
have been set loose.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.952
- Set loose?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.287
How?

40:57.289 --> 41:01.224
- Demons and evil thrive
on discord intention.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.460
Is there any of that
in your home?

41:03.462 --> 41:06.129
- Yeah, for quite a while, now.

41:07.498 --> 41:10.633
My wife was killed in a
drunk driving accident

41:10.635 --> 41:13.870
and my daughter
has never forgiven me.

41:14.805 --> 41:17.807
- Why does she need
to forgive you?

41:19.210 --> 41:21.377
- I was the drunk driver.

41:23.948 --> 41:24.848
- I see.

41:27.184 --> 41:30.186
To further explain,
Charles humes took building

41:30.188 --> 41:33.456
materials and used them
on his house, as well.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.924
He confessed to me
that that's when

41:34.926 --> 41:37.293
he was driven
to kill his family.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.729
That he was possessed
and it started

41:39.731 --> 41:43.299
when he introduced the
lumber into his home.

41:43.301 --> 41:46.803
Do you have any leftover
pieces of the material?

41:46.805 --> 41:48.872
- Yeah, in the basement.

41:56.481 --> 41:58.214
- What are you doing?

41:58.216 --> 42:00.884
- Uh, just taking your picture.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.887
Beauty in nature, I'll call it.

42:03.889 --> 42:06.990
- Don't you think
you should ask first?

42:06.992 --> 42:09.893
- Okay, mind if I take
your photo?

42:12.129 --> 42:13.530
- Sure, why not?

42:14.565 --> 42:15.698
But not here.

42:17.501 --> 42:20.870
Over there, away from the road.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.038
- Yeah, sure.

42:23.007 --> 42:26.175
Just so you know, I'm
not some kind of pervert.

43:32.943 --> 43:35.178
- This wasn't here before.

43:43.854 --> 43:44.988
- It's blood.

43:46.156 --> 43:48.358
Jeremy, it's blood.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.826
- Could be from rats.

43:49.828 --> 43:51.160
Just placed
a whole bunch of traps.

43:51.162 --> 43:54.197
One of them could have
escaped and bled here.

43:54.199 --> 43:56.966
- That's enough blood
to kill six rats.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.602
This is human blood, and fresh.

44:02.239 --> 44:05.642
- There is an intruder
in our sanctuary.

44:10.614 --> 44:12.749
- What do we have here?

44:12.751 --> 44:13.983
The boys club?

44:15.853 --> 44:17.787
- No.

44:17.789 --> 44:20.556
N-no, it's impossible.

44:20.558 --> 44:22.692
- You did this to me.

44:22.694 --> 44:26.129
You worthless drunk,
no good husband.

44:26.131 --> 44:28.464
You caused my death.

44:28.466 --> 44:31.634
You were barely ever even
half a man!

44:33.070 --> 44:35.571
- Dear god, please forgive me.

44:35.573 --> 44:38.274
- I'll never forgive you ever!

44:38.276 --> 44:41.010
I can't wait to see you in hell!

44:42.012 --> 44:42.912
- Ah!

44:57.861 --> 45:00.163
You have my full attention.

45:04.468 --> 45:06.135
- I need you
in functioning order

45:06.137 --> 45:09.172
for what we are about to face.

45:09.174 --> 45:12.742
- Trust me, I need this
to function.

45:12.744 --> 45:16.079
- Please, I'm asking you
to stay sober.

45:24.122 --> 45:27.390
- I can't believe
this is happening!

45:27.392 --> 45:31.661
I barely believe in god,
let alone the devil.

45:31.663 --> 45:34.430
- They have been waging war
for eternity.

45:34.432 --> 45:37.700
Now you are one of his soldiers.

45:37.702 --> 45:41.137
- What if he doesn't want me
to help?

45:41.139 --> 45:43.005
- This situation
was ordained before

45:43.007 --> 45:45.742
we were a twinkle in time's eye.

45:46.710 --> 45:49.879
The evil is after your daughter,

45:49.881 --> 45:53.516
because she is young,
malleable, persuaded.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.752
Where is she?

45:57.020 --> 46:01.057
- She's out,
she'll be back soon.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.059
What are we gonna do?

46:03.061 --> 46:04.694
Confront her?

46:04.696 --> 46:06.129
- No.

46:06.131 --> 46:09.632
She may already be aware
of what is going on.

46:09.634 --> 46:12.034
We need to be sensible.

46:12.036 --> 46:12.935
Tell her,

46:14.338 --> 46:15.872
tell her
I'm a high school friend

46:15.874 --> 46:18.074
and I'm visiting for a day
or so.

46:18.076 --> 46:20.376
That way, we can both be strong
and ready

46:20.378 --> 46:22.845
when the chance comes.

46:22.847 --> 46:24.480
- What are you, uh,

46:26.049 --> 46:27.650
I mean, we,

46:27.652 --> 46:30.253
planning on doing about this?

46:30.255 --> 46:32.722
- Exorcising the evil from her

46:32.724 --> 46:35.024
and ultimately, this house.

46:37.327 --> 46:39.729
- Didn't your brother already
try that?

46:39.731 --> 46:41.297
- Yes.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.765
And he succeeded.

46:43.700 --> 46:46.502
- No offense,
but he's also dead.

47:20.370 --> 47:22.104
Don't be afraid, Amy.

47:22.106 --> 47:23.739
This is father benna.

47:23.741 --> 47:24.774
He's an old high-school friend

47:24.776 --> 47:26.676
who was passing by
in the neighborhood.

47:26.678 --> 47:28.477
He's gonna be staying a day
or two.

47:28.479 --> 47:30.112
- Nice to meet you.

47:33.283 --> 47:36.219
- You never finished
high school.

47:36.221 --> 47:39.055
And I never knew you
to have friends,

47:39.057 --> 47:40.790
especially a priest.

47:42.960 --> 47:46.262
- Yes, we even grew up
in the same neighborhood.

47:46.264 --> 47:47.163
- Cute.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.765
If you'll excuse me.

48:04.848 --> 48:05.748
Help me.

48:08.887 --> 48:09.785
Help me.

48:11.588 --> 48:12.889
There is a holy
shaman in the house.

48:18.762 --> 48:19.929
He is strong.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.700
- What's in here?

49:30.702 --> 49:32.001
- It's a workspace.

49:32.003 --> 49:34.837
My wife used to make
decorative boxes in there.

49:34.839 --> 49:37.106
I didn't want her messing up
the house

49:37.108 --> 49:39.608
with the glues and sprays.

49:39.610 --> 49:40.476
- We better bless this, too.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.134
- Never had a fly problem
before.

50:05.136 --> 50:06.369
- There's a lot of problems
you've never

50:06.371 --> 50:09.438
had before that you're about
to encounter.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.574
Let's keep going.

50:38.870 --> 50:40.169
- Hello?

50:40.171 --> 50:41.003
- Hey, there.

50:41.005 --> 50:42.471
Feeling any better?

50:42.473 --> 50:43.539
- I suppose.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.143
- You sure?

50:47.145 --> 50:49.445
You don't sound like it.

50:49.447 --> 50:50.546
Can I come by later?

50:50.548 --> 50:51.447
- No.

50:54.851 --> 50:58.054
- Don't, don't you want
to see me?

50:58.056 --> 50:59.655
- It's not that.

50:59.657 --> 51:03.092
My father has a friend here
visiting.

51:03.094 --> 51:04.860
I have an idea.

51:04.862 --> 51:07.563
Why don't I sneak out
and meet you?

51:07.565 --> 51:09.365
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

51:09.367 --> 51:11.667
What's the time and place?

51:11.669 --> 51:13.102
- In an hour.

51:13.104 --> 51:16.806
Park your car
at the old recreation field.

51:16.808 --> 51:18.240
I'll be there.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.675
- Okay, sounds like a plan.

51:19.677 --> 51:21.477
See you then.

51:35.692 --> 51:37.359
- Well, that should do it.

51:37.361 --> 51:39.128
The entire perimeter
and the foundations

51:39.130 --> 51:42.631
are blessed with holy water
and blanketed in prayer.

51:50.408 --> 51:52.341
- Will that help?

51:52.343 --> 51:54.110
- It will help keep the
evil from escaping once

51:54.112 --> 51:56.145
we begin the exorcism.

51:56.147 --> 51:58.247
- Isn't that what we want it
to do?

52:03.520 --> 52:04.854
- No.

52:04.856 --> 52:07.990
We want to stop it and
send it back to hell.

52:09.227 --> 52:12.394
- Is there really such a place?

52:12.396 --> 52:16.332
- Yes, just like there
is a place called heaven.

52:16.334 --> 52:19.068
We make our own hell and our own
heaven.

52:19.070 --> 52:20.603
We simply have to decide which
one

52:20.605 --> 52:23.839
we will step into when our time
comes.

52:45.629 --> 52:47.830
- When are we going to
perform this exorcism?

52:47.832 --> 52:49.365
- When the time is right.

52:49.367 --> 52:50.833
Possibly tonight.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.535
Maybe tomorrow.

52:52.537 --> 52:54.036
Trust me, Jeremy.

52:55.138 --> 52:56.038
- I, I do.

52:57.908 --> 53:00.276
She'll be okay afterwards,
right?

53:00.278 --> 53:02.711
- She'll be back to normal.

53:02.713 --> 53:04.180
- I'll take that.

53:05.248 --> 53:09.618
What are we gonna use to
fight against this evil?

53:09.620 --> 53:12.721
- Our wits, our strength,
our faith

53:12.723 --> 53:14.790
and our courage.

53:14.792 --> 53:17.927
- Running low
on all those ingredients.

53:17.929 --> 53:20.362
- When the time comes,
you'll find all of them.

53:20.364 --> 53:24.500
You have to, for your
daughter's sake, and yours.

53:25.268 --> 53:26.468
Let's get something to eat
and then we'll

53:26.470 --> 53:29.038
bless the inside of the house.

53:46.624 --> 53:47.456
- Come on.

53:47.458 --> 53:49.358
What's taking so long?

53:55.498 --> 53:56.398
What?

54:04.274 --> 54:05.107
- Ah!

54:05.109 --> 54:06.008
- Jesus!

54:20.758 --> 54:24.159
Damn, you scared the hell
out of me!

54:24.161 --> 54:29.765
- Did i
scare the hell out of you?

54:29.767 --> 54:33.202
- Yeah, that's what
i just said--

54:33.204 --> 54:35.871
- I mean the real hell.

54:35.873 --> 54:38.107
Did I scare it out of you?

54:39.976 --> 54:42.611
- What, what's gotten into you?

54:42.613 --> 54:43.512
- Him.

55:25.856 --> 55:26.755
- Ah!

55:31.795 --> 55:32.695
Ah!

55:50.780 --> 55:52.247
- Where'd she go?

55:53.350 --> 55:54.850
Where is she?

56:26.649 --> 56:28.751
Where've you been?

56:28.753 --> 56:30.552
- I don't feel so good.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.588
- Let's get her upstairs.

57:01.851 --> 57:03.685
- I don't like the idea
of tying her up.

57:03.687 --> 57:05.621
It's, it's agonizing.

57:05.623 --> 57:07.289
It's cruel.

57:07.291 --> 57:09.858
- If we don't, she may
escape and harm someone,

57:09.860 --> 57:12.594
or herself,
is that what you want?

57:12.596 --> 57:13.929
- Of course not.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.197
- Then we must do it.

57:15.199 --> 57:17.466
We can't afford for her
to get away from us.

57:17.468 --> 57:18.700
- Won't blessing the whole house

57:18.702 --> 57:20.369
keep her confined?

57:20.371 --> 57:23.372
- It will help,
but it isn't a given.

57:23.374 --> 57:26.141
You saw how she weakened when
she stepped inside earlier.

57:26.143 --> 57:27.576
That's a good sign.

57:27.578 --> 57:29.344
We may have the upper hand.

57:29.346 --> 57:31.680
- Then let's get on with
it and get it over with.

57:31.682 --> 57:33.048
- You must be patient.

57:33.050 --> 57:34.550
When the time is right.

57:34.552 --> 57:37.686
- How will know
when it is the right time?

57:37.688 --> 57:39.087
- You'll know.

59:45.415 --> 59:46.315
- Ah!

59:47.650 --> 59:48.483
- No!

59:56.426 --> 59:57.559
How did you--

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.300
- you bastard!

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.370
You filthy priest!

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:10.706
Go to hell!

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.909
I'm gonna kill you, bastard!

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:20.415
- Ah!

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:24.953
- Amy, stop!

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:39.267
- Let's get her upstairs,
quickly.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:40.769
The time has come.

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.271
If we don't act now,
it will be too late.

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:44.840
You must be strong.

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:48.443
Whatever is says or does
it is not your daughter.

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:50.479
Do you understand?

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:51.847
- Yeah, I guess.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:54.650
- No, you must forget
this is your daughter.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:57.019
It is a shell of what she was.

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:58.387
He will bring her back.

01:00:58.389 --> 01:00:59.821
Stay strong.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:00.956
- Where are you going?

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.524
- To get my bag of tricks.

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.159
I'll be right back.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.460
Keep an eye on her.

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:09.498
Whatever you do, don't
listen to anything it says.

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:30.719
Where's my bag?

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:55.677
- Jeremy!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.951
Look what you did to me,
you stupid drunk!

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.656
And look what you're
doing to our daughter.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.192
Untie me now.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.528
- No.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.630
I can't.

01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:17.632
Father benna says I can't.

01:02:17.634 --> 01:02:20.702
- To hell with father benna
and you.

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:27.375
How much more pain are you
going to inflict on us?

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.812
- No, you're not her.

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.081
My wife is dead.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.149
- Yes, dead,

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.452
all because of you.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.289
If Amy had been in the
car with me that day,

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.859
she'd be in hell with me, too.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.497
Untie me you sack of shit.

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:51.867
- I can't.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.035
I won't.

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:57.372
- You were never good
at anything

01:02:57.374 --> 01:03:00.542
except diving into your bottle.

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:03.779
Redeem yourself
and do something good.

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.447
Untie us.

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.016
- No, no, no.

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:19.528
- Here it is.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.842
The devil's toys

01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:35.644
all lined up in a row.

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.453
You did well by resisting.

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:55.690
Now let's send these devils
back to where they came from.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.663
What is your name?

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:39.968
What is your name?

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:41.803
- Fuck you, priest.

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:43.238
Eat shit.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.540
- Your name, foul creature!

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.809
- Ah!

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:50.512
We are many.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.014
So many.

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.685
- You are nothing.

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:57.686
A liar.

01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:58.753
A deceiver.

01:05:58.755 --> 01:05:59.754
A thief.

01:05:59.756 --> 01:06:00.989
- I am legion.

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:04.225
Legion!

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.896
Fuck you, priest!

01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:10.265
- What is legion?

01:06:10.267 --> 01:06:11.800
- There are many demons in her

01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:14.536
all forming one strong union.

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:16.304
We will break it.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.039
- You are so unwise.

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:23.912
I will break you, like
i broke your brother's

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:26.815
neck when I flung him
out the window!

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:28.516
Cocksucker.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.288
- Hear my prayer, oh lord.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.190
Give me your strength.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.359
This demon is no match for you,

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:41.162
as it has already lost
and lived its own lie.

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:45.266
Foul creature,
release this young girl.

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.703
Go back to the devil
where you came from.

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:52.007
Leave amityville in peace
for all time!

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:01.816
- Drink that, asshole!

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:04.152
Drunk!

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:05.987
Killer!

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:09.124
Mommy killer! Mommy killer!

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.595
- Shut up, shut up!

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:17.165
- You must not,
under any circumstances,

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:18.500
engage with it!

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:22.404
- You need to leave my daughter.

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:24.139
It's agonizing!

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:25.840
You're hurting her!

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:29.377
- It's hurting her,
and we must stop it.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.179
Lord, have mercy.

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.248
Christ have mercy.

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.383
Lord have mercy.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.385
Christ hear us.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.554
God, the father in heaven.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.489
God of the son.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:43.491
Redeemer of the world.

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:45.994
God the holy spirit.

01:07:45.996 --> 01:07:47.862
Holy Trinity, one god.

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.999
Holy mother of god.

01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:53.401
Holy virgin of virgins.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.036
- Piss off, priest!

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.806
You pious asshole!

01:07:57.808 --> 01:08:01.142
- From all evil, deliver us,
oh lord.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:02.811
From all sin.

01:08:02.813 --> 01:08:04.112
- Stop!

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:06.314
- From your wrath.

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:09.017
From sudden
and unprovided death.

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:11.619
From the snares of the devil.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.556
From anger,
hatred and all ill-will.

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:16.491
From all lewdness.

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:19.160
From lightning and tempest.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.563
From the scourge of earthquakes.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:24.332
From plague, famine and wars.

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:26.533
From everlasting death.

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:30.037
By the mystery
of your holy incarnation.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.874
By your coming, by your birth.

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:36.010
By your baptism
and holy fasting.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.245
By your cross.

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:40.415
By your death and burial.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.783
By your holy resurrection.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:45.286
By your wondrous ascension.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.721
By the coming
of the holy spirit,

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:50.859
and the advocates
on the day of judgment.

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:53.194
Our father, who art in heaven,

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:54.761
hallowed be thy name.

01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:59.466
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.769
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.272
Give us this day our daily bread

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:06.474
and forgive us our trespasses

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:09.644
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.845
Lead us not into temptation

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:13.715
but deliver us from evil.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:14.616
- Stop!

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:16.951
Stop!

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:23.323
- Save your children who
trust in you, my god.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:25.160
Let him find in you lord,

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:27.095
a fortified tower.

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.830
In the face of the enemy,
let the enemy

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.999
have no power over her

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:34.702
and the son of inequity
be powerless to harm her.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:37.404
Lord, send her aid
from your holy place

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:40.241
and watch over her from Zion.

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:42.176
Lord, heed my prayer

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:45.013
and let my cry be heard by you.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.616
- What happened?

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.084
Why am I tied up?

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.252
- It worked!

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:53.154
Amy!

01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:56.524
- It is the great deceiver!

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:59.294
Do not always believe
what you see!

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.929
- But, look at her her!

01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:05.366
- Please, untie me father.

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:09.637
- Kiss the holy cross
and swear on it

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:11.039
by the almighty.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:24.953
Ah!

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.139
- Where'd she go?

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:55.116
- I want you to meet my father.

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.663
- Open this door!

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.266
Let me in.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.902
Don't hurt my baby.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:16.271
- It's over, priest.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.872
Her soul is mine.

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.173
This street is mine.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:19.173
This town.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:23.645
You put up a fine fight
and are to be commended

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:27.348
but your god seems to
have forsaken you tonight.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.417
- Let's devour his soul!

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:30.718
The asshole!

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:36.057
- What do you have to
say, priest, in your loss?

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:37.558
Your defeat?

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.228
- Let's torture him to death.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.296
The bastard!

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:45.333
- Well, priest,
what have you to say?

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.569
- Let's make him bleed!

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:50.872
The shitlicker!

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:54.108
- Words escape you.

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.443
Your book.

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:59.347
Maybe you'll find comfort
there, before you die.

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:01.549
- I have one thing to say.
