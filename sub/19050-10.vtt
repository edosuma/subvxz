00:03.128 --> 00:05.047
[Mac ] Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.966
It's been one week
since my last confession.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.801
Okay, my son.

00:09.885 --> 00:14.932
In the name of the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, what is your confession?

00:15.807 --> 00:17.476
I'm fat.

00:41.750 --> 00:46.672
O great and angry God, |
command thee to smite my friends!

00:46.755 --> 00:51.260
Now, calm down, son! Calm down.
Let's try and remain composed.

00:51.343 --> 00:54.429
Okay, Father, I'll try, but I can't promise
anything 'cause I'm pretty excitable.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.932
Also, I'm super-pissed
because my friends made me fat.

00:57.015 --> 01:01.103
How did your friends make you
fat? Were they force-feeding you?

01:01.186 --> 01:03.272
Well, no, not exactly.

01:03.355 --> 01:07.025
This whole thing started because
we became incredibly successful,

01:07.109 --> 01:11.238
and then they became monsters,
which in turn made them make me fat.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.616
So, really, I'd like to confess on them,
because they're sinners and pricks.

01:14.700 --> 01:20.414
[ Chuckling ] Son, | don't think you
understand the purpose of confession.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.166
Right. All right. Sorry,
Father. You need the context.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.168
Let me start
at the beginning.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.422
My friends and | own and
operate a bar in South Philly,

01:28.505 --> 01:31.925
and a few weeks ago, we became
more successful than we ever have before.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.885
It was insane.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.762
Oh, oh, oh!
[ Chattering ]

01:35.846 --> 01:38.932
Look who's back!
[ Laughs ]

01:39.016 --> 01:41.310
| scored
a shitload of fireworks.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.811
Out of my way, Frank.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.606
Oh. Hey. [ Clears Throat ] Whoa.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.692
North Carolina.
What a hell of a state.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.278
Not now, Frank.
We're packed.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.364
What the shit
is going on around here?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.871
[ Charlie ] | really don't get it. I
don't see how we're so popular now.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.707
| just can't wrap my head around
this. Were we doing anything different?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.252
- Guys, we may have tipped.
- Uh-oh.

02:07.336 --> 02:10.756
No, this is a good thing. This is what
happens with success in business.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.551
Hmm? Okay, if you keep making
the right decisions over time,

02:14.635 --> 02:18.847
eventually you will get to a point where
you tip and you become successful.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.850
- It's like that book, The Tipping Point.
- I totally buy that!

02:21.933 --> 02:25.520
Like, check out this decision. | keep
a very clean bar every day, very tidy.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.481
| think people
respond to that.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.484
They say, “What was that clean bar | was at
the other week?” And then they show up again.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.487
And then someone says, “Hey, did
you see that clean bar? Let's go there.”

02:33.570 --> 02:36.031
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And my comedy, you know.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.533
All my— All my funny jokes
and stuff that I throw out.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.078
You know, I'm like the
cute, funny waitress...

02:41.161 --> 02:45.248
who has all these one-liners and
hilarious jabs | throw at the customers,

02:45.332 --> 02:47.751
and I add all that charm
to the place.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.420
That's—
That's probably doing it.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.340
Yeah, good-looking guy like myself,
takes pride in his personal appearance,

02:53.423 --> 02:56.051
takes pride in his personal
hygiene, has great hair.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.513
You put a guy like that behind the bar, and
people will eventually flock to this man.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.641
That-That's what you're saying,
yeah. That's what you're saying.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.602
- Sort of.
- I didn't think it was—

03:05.686 --> 03:08.605
Look, the point is that we gotta
keep doing what it is that we do.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.358
No matter how
psychotically vain— Right.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.821
- Or needy and pathetic or, | mean, just plain sad.
- Right.

03:15.904 --> 03:19.324
Let's not put labels on it, 'cause we don't
know which one is the one that is the most—

03:19.408 --> 03:22.369
If we keep doing all of it,
then we will keep tipping up.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.496
- Yes.
- Nice!

03:24.621 --> 03:27.082
In order to maintain this success, | do
think though we need to get some rest.

03:27.165 --> 03:31.753
Let's do the right thing here for once in our
lives, go home and get a good night's sleep.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.339
[Mac ] But that sleep
would never come, Father,

03:34.423 --> 03:36.591
<i>because success was about
to change everything.</i>

03:39.010 --> 03:40.345
Hey, Charlie,
you asleep?

03:40.470 --> 03:42.305
Charlie. Are you asleep? No— No!

03:42.431 --> 03:44.516
| had a great idea.
| don't want to hear it.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.518
Frank, I'm a successful man now.
Okay?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.520
| need to maintain
a certain level of excellence,

03:48.603 --> 03:50.605
so I can't have you telling me
terrible ideas all night,

03:50.689 --> 03:52.607
'cause that brings me
off my excellence, okay?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.901
Okay, but this is a great
idea. | don't want to—

03:54.985 --> 03:57.320
We take the M-80's
that I have...

03:57.404 --> 03:59.948
and we stick 'em
in some lamb.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.576
And “pa-chow!”
We blow it up!

04:02.659 --> 04:07.372
Wh-What are you looking to do?
Flash-cook a— a gyro sandwich?

04:07.456 --> 04:09.750
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.127
Flash-cook a sandwich.
Oh, my God. Do you—

04:12.210 --> 04:13.837
Cook the meat
immediately.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.257
What you're talking about is just a
meat bomb. That's a waste of a good lamb.

04:17.339 --> 04:20.761
So if you're done with coming up with terrible
ideas, um, I'm going to go back to bed.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.555
A meat bomb! Y-Y-Y-You
blow it up. [ Groaning ]

04:23.680 --> 04:26.516
| mean, like, just take the
thing and stick it— [ Yelling ]

04:26.641 --> 04:29.686
[ Imitates Bleating ]
Aah!

04:29.811 --> 04:33.523
I'm going to the crevice! No, no, no,
no! Charlie! Don't go in the crevice.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.193
Charlie, don't go in the crevice.
I'm going in the crevice, Frank.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.321
Don't go in the crevice.
Oh, come on, man.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.114
[ Sighs ]
[ Phone Ringing ]

04:41.198 --> 04:42.741
Oh, my God!

04:44.367 --> 04:47.078
Yello. Hey-o. It's
Mac. What's up?

04:47.204 --> 04:50.373
Hey-o! 'Sup? Yeah, I'm
gonna go out and rage.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.959
ls Charlie there? Hey, it's
Mac. He wants to go rage.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.253
| don't care.
I'm in the crevice.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.048
He's in the crevice.
Shit He's in the crevice?

04:58.173 --> 05:01.718
I'll come out with you. We'll go together,
have a ball. [ Line Clicks, Dial Tone ]

05:01.802 --> 05:03.553
Hello?

05:03.637 --> 05:06.640
I-I'm not seeing how this
relates to your weight gain.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.433
Uh, I'm telling a story, Father.
[ Scoffs ]

05:08.517 --> 05:10.811
Frank's not a guy that
usually comes up with plans.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.271
You want to know all the key players
and how success affected them, right?

05:13.355 --> 05:16.525
Well, I think your time could be better
spent if you focused more on yourself.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.903
But I haven't done
very much wrong.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.239
You know what, Father?
I'm just going to plow ahead.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.241
Because I'm sensing
some resistance.

05:24.366 --> 05:28.745
Dennis always tells me, never let someone's
resistance stop you from getting what you want.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.373
So, the bar's success continued.

05:31.456 --> 05:35.001
But Dee's inflated ego about her
comedy was keeping her from doing her job.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.421
Kids these days, they have so many more
choices than we had when we were little.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.799
Am I right? | mean, it's
like— Excuse me? Excuse me.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.260
Do you want to watch Kung Fu
Panda on Blu-ray— Excuse me.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.679
Oh, my God. Yeah? We are
still waiting on those beers.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.515
Yeah! I know.
[ Scoffs ]

05:48.598 --> 05:51.852
Right in the middle of a joke.
And now where was I with it?

05:51.935 --> 05:54.646
Can, um, we get those margaritas
that we ordered a while ago as well?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.523
That'd be great. Yeah.
Can I finish the joke?

05:56.606 --> 05:59.693
'Cause the funny part comes at the end,
so you're going to miss it if you don't—

05:59.776 --> 06:02.362
- You keep trying to tell jokes— - Well, you
keep interrupting me, and that's why I'm not—

06:02.445 --> 06:03.864
They're not really landing.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.866
They're not landing because
I'm not getting to the punch line,

06:05.949 --> 06:07.701
so if you could just be patient
and let me get it out.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.496
- Kids these days have SO many more
choices— - Don't try to finish the joke.

06:11.580 --> 06:15.041
- I'm not gonna even listen. | just want my margarita.
- Do you want Kung Fu Panda-

06:15.166 --> 06:17.544
You're not getting
your margarita. Thanks.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.588
Why do we have this?
What is this?

06:19.671 --> 06:22.048
Dude, where the hell
have you been?

06:22.132 --> 06:23.842
Uh, slept in.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.095
You slept in? It's almost the middle of
the night, man. Why were you sleeping in?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.890
Oh, God. Well, because | drank
three bottles of champagne...

06:29.973 --> 06:32.058
and hung out with a stray dog
all night under a bridge, okay?

06:32.142 --> 06:33.810
It was sweet.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.147
Can I please get, like, 20 margaritas
so this bitch will listen to my kid joke?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.149
Okay, first of all, your
jokes never land. All right?

06:39.232 --> 06:42.611
So please don't concentrate on your comedy
anymore. 'Cause it's terrible, all right?

06:42.694 --> 06:45.113
I'm sorry. I said it. Look, can
we just do what we normally do?

06:45.196 --> 06:47.073
| shouldn't even
be bartending.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.868
I'm In over my head, I'm yelling at customers
'cause I"m getting a little agitated here.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.037
Can Dennis please come here
and do this? Where is Dennis?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.080
Dennis is in the bathroom, and
he's been there for, like, an hour!

06:54.164 --> 06:56.791
Okay, company meeting in
the bathroom. Okay, guys?

06:56.875 --> 06:58.209
Company meeting.
Let's go.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.963
Dennis! Where are you,
bud? Company meeting!

07:02.088 --> 07:05.216
Uh, I'm in here. Good, man.
Hop on out. Company meeting.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.678
- I don't want to.
- You have to. I's a company meeting.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.221
What's going on
in there?

07:10.305 --> 07:11.848
I'm bashing it.
I'm bashing it!

07:11.932 --> 07:14.851
Oh, no. No, no, don't
bash. I-1-I'll come out.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.062
- Oh!
- [ All Gasping, Exclaiming ]

07:17.145 --> 07:22.108
Uh, I saw a couple gray hairs, and I was,
like, “I'll eradicate those,” and then—

07:22.192 --> 07:24.778
- With black paint?
- Well, just go easy on me. Don't make fun of me.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.530
| feel very sensitive right now.
It's hard to maintain all this.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.074
You look like Superman.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.785
Oh, cool. Yeah, right on.
Well, he was the original, right? So—

07:31.910 --> 07:33.954
The original what?
S-Superhero.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.206
He was, like— Is that
what you're going for?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.166
- No.
- Dude, come on!

07:38.249 --> 07:41.544
It wouldn't be that obvious if you didn't know
me. You'd be, “Shit. Maybe that's Superman.”

07:41.628 --> 07:44.297
No, you wouldn't! Everyone knows who
Superman is, and they know it's not you!

07:44.381 --> 07:45.924
- Shit. Right.
- Guys, come on!

07:46.007 --> 07:48.343
Clearly, success is
starting to get to all of us!

07:48.426 --> 07:49.803
We can't be Superman!

07:49.886 --> 07:52.263
Yeah, no shit. I'm running
around like an animal out there.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.932
All I'm doing
is serving drinks!

07:54.015 --> 07:55.934
You're supposed to serve
drinks. You're a waitress.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.687
People need their drinks, and we
need a waitress to serve those drinks!

07:58.770 --> 08:00.647
Guys, don't change now.
All right?

08:00.730 --> 08:04.234
We have a certain chemistry that got us
here to begin with. We don't need to start—

08:04.317 --> 08:07.529
Aw, that's terrible! Let's just get
back out there and step it up a little bit.

08:07.612 --> 08:12.242
Please? Let's just get back to
work, man, and do what we do. Okay?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.954
“Back to work.
Back to work, everybody.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.207
I'm Charlie, and I'm in
charge all of a sudden.”

Are you eating in there?

| got some doughnuts and
some M&M's and some, uh, chips.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.841
| could pass them through
if you want some.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.093
You aren't allowed
to eat in here!

08:30.176 --> 08:32.095
I'm sorry, Father.
| have enough.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.722
If you want a doughnut,
| could give you one.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.350
You better put that away or
come back when you're finished.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.311
Okay.
I-I'm done. Done.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.023
Uh, so Charlie
was up all night working,

08:43.106 --> 08:46.776
and Frank kept coming up with
plans, and they were not good.

[ Yawning ]

08:57.704 --> 09:00.290
Ow! [ Laughs ] Hey, that's good.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.751
You wanna do that to people?
What is that? What are you doing?

09:02.834 --> 09:04.878
It's a plan. We'll do it to
people. We'll go around-

09:04.961 --> 09:07.630
Look at that. Look at the look
on your face. That's so good!

09:07.714 --> 09:09.841
Frank, I don't even think
you know what a plan is, dude.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.053
All right, I got something else I've been
working on all night. Come with me. Lock up.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.096
Don't hit me with the
stick again. Come with me.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.598
Oh, my God.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.517
Okay, Charlie?
All right, look at this now.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.145
| put two extra
stop signs. Yeah.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.813
Now there's four
stop signs. All right.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.900
So no cars can go.
[ Laughing ]

09:33.656 --> 09:36.409
Frank, you've just created
a four-way intersection.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.411
If anything, you've made
this intersection safer.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.705
No shit.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.415
Oh.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.585
Look, dude, I don't have time for these
shenanigans. All right? I need sleep.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.545
I'm a success now.
I'm trying so hard not to tip.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.963
You need sleep?
Ow!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.007

egotistical monsters.

19:32.046 --> 19:35.383
They forced me into this avatar thing,
and now they're totally ditching the plan.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.885
But it's all about the avatar.
The beefcake avatar.

19:37.968 --> 19:41.430
But you weren't gonna understand
that unless | told you the whole story.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.015
I-'m going to be perfectly honest.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.685
| still don't know
what you want me to do.

19:45.768 --> 19:49.063
Okay, um, let me start at the beginning,
because clearly you didn't understand it.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.982
No, no, no! No, no, no.
That won't be necessary.

19:52.066 --> 19:55.986
I-If, uh— If I smite your friends
and absolve you, will you leave?

19:56.112 --> 19:59.198
Yeah. You're absolved,
and your friends are smited.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.701
In the name of the Father, Son
and Holy Spirit. Please leave.

20:01.784 --> 20:05.121
[ Laughing ] Okay, great. Oh,
um, when should | see the results?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.082
- What are you talking about?
- When does the spell kick in?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.543
Wh-When is God gonna shed
some of this weight for me?

20:10.626 --> 20:13.045
- Six weeks.
- Great.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.755
Not hard.
Perfect.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.966
Uh, glory unto you,
ghost man in the sky...

20:17.049 --> 20:19.176
that created us all
and predetermines everything.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.304
[ Chuckles ] I'll see you in
six weeks. [ Priest Groans ]
