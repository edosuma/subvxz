WEBVTT

00:00.501 --> 00:02.801
(theme music)

00:46.079 --> 00:47.513
- More deliveries?

00:47.614 --> 00:49.547
- My accounts at the tailor
and haberdashery

00:49.550 --> 00:50.682
Are through the roof.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.152
- We need to do something
before he bleeds us dry.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.292
- These came for you.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.928
- Ah! Splendid.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.231
(groaning)

01:08.135 --> 01:09.268
(chuckling)

01:12.672 --> 01:16.308
Arthur, be a chum and help me
get into this here jacket.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.048
Ah!

01:23.050 --> 01:24.048
Whoo!

01:24.051 --> 01:26.318
Exemplary work, don't you think?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.919
- It is quite beautiful,

01:27.922 --> 01:30.722
But it is the third smoking
jacket this month.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.125
Do you need quite so many?
- Oh!

01:35.095 --> 01:38.897
Um, one never knows when one
will be buried alive again.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.168
I want to remain smartly
dressed just in case.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.640
Arthur, open that box.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.544
Aren't those slippers beautiful?

01:54.181 --> 01:55.948
Put those on my feet, please.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.552
- Father, there's no need
for this.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.754
You can put on
your own slippers.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.823
- Oh, wouldn't it be a shame if
I walked out of this house?

02:05.826 --> 02:09.128
A dead man walking right into
the arms of the authorities.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.897
You'd both be hauled off
to jail.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.300
So, when I tell arthur to put
my slippers on my feet,

02:15.402 --> 02:20.005
I want arthur to put
my slippers... On my feet.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.352
Oh, you can do better than that.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.855
- Well, I just did
what you said.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.657
- Kneel.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.594
Kneel down, put my slippers
on my feet, boy.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.931
I'm waiting.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.574
Good.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.709
Now the other.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.348
(sighing)

03:04.351 --> 03:06.184
That wasn't so hard now, was it?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.886
- Anything else?

03:08.788 --> 03:10.055
- No.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.257
And thank you, arthur.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.263
Okay, where was I? Oh!

03:20.267 --> 03:21.833
(chuckling)

03:21.835 --> 03:25.170
- Our organization, the canadian
women's olympic campaign,

03:25.272 --> 03:26.939
Represents women in sport.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.776
- What are you trying
to accomplish here, ladies?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.978
- We want canada to bring
a team of women

03:33.080 --> 03:34.913
To the 1912 stockholm olympics.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.949
- Did you know that 65 women
have competed in the olympics

03:37.952 --> 03:40.051
Since 1900,
but none from canada?

03:40.588 --> 03:42.854
- Well, many would say
that's because no one

03:42.856 --> 03:44.389
Would ever watch
women's olympic sports.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.991
- Well, that's complete hogwash.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.293
Women are just
as thrilling as men.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.462
British figure skater
madge syers,

03:50.464 --> 03:53.264
She beat a field of men
and won the silver medal

03:53.267 --> 03:54.666
At the world championships!

03:54.768 --> 03:58.003
- We are all athletes here, just
like the fellas over there.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.471
We should be given our fair due.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.940
- Well, what sport do you play?
- I'm a runner.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.209
- Ha! But that's not even
an olympic women's sport.

04:04.311 --> 04:07.012
- That's precisely our point.
It should be.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.847
- Maybe embroidery should be
an olympic sport?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.316
- I beg your pardon?
- Maybe, uh, gossiping?

04:11.318 --> 04:13.652
- All right, ladies.
That's enough time.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.188
(sighing)
- come on.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.693
- Tomorrow's demonstration meet
will allow these athletes

04:21.695 --> 04:24.128
To measure their progress
as they work towards

04:24.131 --> 04:25.830
The 1912 olympic games.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.901
Next, we have the men competing
in the 100-metre dash.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.437
Why don't you lot
introduce yourselves?

04:32.539 --> 04:33.839
- Walter knox.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.176
Orillia.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.811
- John armstrong-howard.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.015
Winnipeg.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.150
- Timothy irons.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.522
Hamilton.
- Scotty scorch.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.324
The fastest man in canada.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.026
Born right in this great city!

04:57.330 --> 05:00.999
- Uh, mr. Scorch, neither you
nor mr. Armstrong-howard

05:01.101 --> 05:03.601
Has lost a single race
this year.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.670
Now that you're going
head-to-head,

05:05.672 --> 05:07.072
Are you a little nervous?

05:07.074 --> 05:08.573
- The only reason
he's never lost a race

05:08.575 --> 05:10.642
Is because he's never
raced against me.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.811
- I could say the same.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.346
Don't let your little
local success

05:14.448 --> 05:15.680
Get to your head, scorch.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.816
- Only thing fast about you
is your mouth, scorch.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.217
- Lucky nobody asked you, timmy.

05:22.188 --> 05:23.955
I'll show all you pitiful losers

05:23.957 --> 05:26.458
Exactly how fast I am
tomorrow on the track.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.202
(eerie music)

05:49.616 --> 05:50.782
- By god.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.196
(phone ringing)

06:06.499 --> 06:09.067
- William, you left
at the crack of dawn.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.468
You forgot your hat.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.003
- Oh, thank you.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.871
That wasn't necessary.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.474
I just wasn't feeling myself
this morning

06:16.477 --> 06:19.211
With the little one
screaming through the night.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.547
- Ah, yes, she's improved a
little this morning, thankfully.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.549
She was finally eating
when I left her with ellie.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.017
- Oh, well, that's good.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.286
- Yes, I should get back
to that, actually.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.554
- Oh, wait!

06:29.556 --> 06:32.023
Uh, I've made something
that should help

06:32.125 --> 06:33.759
With susannah's recovery.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.495
- What is it?
- It is a hydration draft.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.898
You see, colds and influenza

06:39.900 --> 06:42.634
Can put the body
in a state of dehydration.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.571
Water, of course, is beneficial,
but by adding different sugars,

06:46.573 --> 06:48.840
Sodium, potassium and fruit,

06:48.842 --> 06:53.044
I've created a drink that helps
to replenish electrolytes

06:53.146 --> 06:54.779
That the body loses
during illness.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.115
- William, it's blue.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.317
- It has blueberry.
For flavour.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.919
(chuckling)
yeah.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.387
- Ah, good morning, doctor.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.456
What brings you here
so bright and early?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.191
- Ah, william forgot his hat.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.593
- What? You left the house
without your hat?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.795
You all right, murdoch?
- Apparently not.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.664
- Sleep deprivation.
Susannah has us up all night.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.734
- Right. Well, there's been
a body found at varsity stadium.

07:16.836 --> 07:19.537
- Varsity stadium?
I was there just yesterday.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.872
- You were?

07:20.974 --> 07:24.141
- Yes, I was speaking to the
press about women's athletics.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.412
Can you believe that canada
still hasn't sent a single woman

07:27.514 --> 07:29.748
To the olympic games?
- Do other countries?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.349
I've been to the olympic games.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.152
I don't recall seeing girls
running around.

07:35.255 --> 07:38.023
- Women have been competing
since 1900.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.192
- Hm, I won a gold medal,
did I ever tell you?

07:41.195 --> 07:44.429
- Ah, yes, I believe you may
have once or twice.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.031
- It was a crisp morning
in st. Louis.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.167
A light fog rolled majestically
across the pristine turf.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.202
- I really should get
to the stadium, then.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.037
- Yes, I should get going
myself, actually.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.273
Are you sure you're all right?
- Oh, yes, much better.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.174
- Ah, yes.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.775
Oh, ha!

07:57.778 --> 07:59.344
- You don't want
to hear the rest?

08:02.215 --> 08:04.049
Ah, well, I'll take these.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.387
- Well, I guess your work
is done here.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.390
- I have to do a full
examination just to be sure.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.593
- Did you notice
the abrasion on his neck?

08:15.695 --> 08:16.695
- No.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.464
- Not like you to miss
something like that.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.133
- I've yet to inspect
his neck, detective.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.004
There appear to be splinters
present under his fingernails.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.138
- Curious.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.240
(yawning)

08:29.976 --> 08:31.309
- Tired, detective?

08:33.112 --> 08:35.480
- I didn't get much sleep
this past weekend.

08:35.482 --> 08:36.948
Susannah was sick.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.350
- Sorry to hear that.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.018
I take it the little one
is all better now?

08:40.119 --> 08:43.288
- Oh, yes. Yes, I've been
working on a solution

08:43.290 --> 08:44.889
To help replenish her fluids.

08:45.792 --> 08:49.226
- You know, I hear athletes
use champagne to hydrate.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.862
Maybe next time
you can try that.

08:51.431 --> 08:54.165
- Henry, have you been giving
baby jordan champagne?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.835
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I would never.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.037
Ruthie is quite unnerved
by bubbles.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.842
- We will need to postpone
the meet until tomorrow,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.243
Given the tragic circumstances.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.712
- Mr. Kittering?

09:08.481 --> 09:10.982
I understand you were
scotty scorch's coach.

09:10.984 --> 09:11.983
- Yes.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.519
He was the star
of my track club.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.922
I cannot believe
this has happened.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.457
- Was he well-liked?
- Well...

09:20.527 --> 09:21.859
I wouldn't say that.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.062
Track and field can be
quite competitive.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.466
- Any idea how he ended up with
a javelin embedded in his chest?

09:28.468 --> 09:29.467
- None.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.469
But I will say this:

09:31.471 --> 09:34.072
Throwing the javelin
is not an easy thing.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.608
There aren't a lot of people
who could land that throw.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.944
- Oh. Well, then,
please direct me to
the people who could.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.881
- Last night,
myself and a few others

09:42.983 --> 09:44.782
Were at the olympic
committee dinner.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.218
- And what time did you
leave this event?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.687
- At 2:00 am.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.222
I didn't know anything about
this until I arrived just now.

09:51.792 --> 09:56.561
- Did you or any of the other
javelin men hold a practice
yesterday evening?

09:56.663 --> 09:58.630
(sighing)
- none of the javelin men

09:58.632 --> 10:00.832
Have anything to do
with this nonsense!

10:00.933 --> 10:02.033
- Nonsense?

10:02.135 --> 10:04.703
- My teammate told me
those damned sprinters

10:04.804 --> 10:07.238
Got him drunk last night
and tricked him into giving him

10:07.240 --> 10:08.840
The equipment room key.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.909
- The key to the room
you're standing in?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.710
- Exactly. And then,
they came back here

10:12.813 --> 10:14.713
And had a throwing competition.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.149
Talk to walter knox,

10:18.151 --> 10:19.951
He pulls these kinds of stunts
all the time.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.454
- Thank you.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.824
- When should I expect
my javelin to be returned?

10:26.927 --> 10:29.728
- The one stuck in the victim?
- Yes.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.363
She's my favourite.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.534
- We went to the pub
around 11 pm

10:36.536 --> 10:38.536
And came back to the track
at 1:00 am.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.339
The throwing competition
was just a bit of fun.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.141
- A bit of fun?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.542
That killed a man.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.678
- There's no way
we killed scorch.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.747
- No? How can you be sure?
- He wasn't with us.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.684
- Didn't all of the 100-metre
men go to the pub?

10:52.686 --> 10:55.352
- Everybody but him.
- He wasn't invited.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.756
No one liked him, not even timmy
and they're teammates.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.425
- Please don't call me timmy.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.961
- So, where was mr. Scorch
last night?

11:03.397 --> 11:04.762
- I have no idea.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.097
- Hm.

11:06.099 --> 11:10.034
So, it was dark,
you all were drunk.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.235
- Yes.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.305
- So it's possible mr. Scorch
wandered onto the field

11:14.407 --> 11:17.508
While you were having your
drunken throwing competition

11:17.610 --> 11:20.311
When a flying javelin
struck him in the chest.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.715
- Sure. But I imagine if a man
was struck by a javelin,

11:23.817 --> 11:25.183
We would have heard him scream.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.917
- A javelin through the heart

11:26.920 --> 11:29.521
Would have likely
killed him instantly.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.123
He probably wouldn't have been
able to make a sound.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.259
- Could we have possibly--
- no way!

11:35.361 --> 11:37.062
We didn't do this and
that's that.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.466
- According to the algor mortis
calculations,

11:42.469 --> 11:46.403
Mr. Scorch died ten hours prior
to his body being discovered.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.739
By 10:00 pm.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.209
- So, before the 100-metre men
went to the pub.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.179
- The javelin entered the victim
at a 45-degree angle

11:54.280 --> 11:56.414
And penetrated his body
seven inches deep.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.317
- Seven inches?

12:00.420 --> 12:01.753
Through his breastplate?

12:01.755 --> 12:02.754
Are you quite sure?

12:02.856 --> 12:04.088
- Yes, quite.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.557
<i> - What are you thinking,</i>
<i> murdoch?</i>

12:05.559 --> 12:07.358
- Momentum.
- What?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.827
- Mass times speed.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.028
Could a javelin be heavy
enough to--

12:10.130 --> 12:11.296
- What are you getting at?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.765
- Henry, we're going to need
constable buster.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.300
- Oh, no.
Not again, sir.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.967
- You heard the man, higgins.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.036
(sighing)

12:19.439 --> 12:20.671
- You heard him, arthur.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.439
If we try anything,
we will go to jail.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.242
- I can't take
much more of this.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.111
And what if he's plotting
something worse?

12:26.212 --> 12:28.646
We have to make our move
before he makes his.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.048
- You're right about that.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.583
My father always has something
nefarious up his sleeve.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.985
- Then we act.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.019
Now!

12:35.822 --> 12:36.954
- I don't know.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.590
We can't afford to miss again.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.724
- We won't.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.726
I won't.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.061
- How can you be so sure?

12:43.163 --> 12:44.929
- I'm far from perfect, violet,

12:45.031 --> 12:47.232
But I never make
the same mistake twice.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.268
- This is too dangerous.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.003
You're not a killer.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.204
There must be another way.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.773
- We've tried everything.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.275
- And what about the body?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.077
What'll we do when
that's all done?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.147
- Well, no one's looking
for him.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.681
He's already dead.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.050
All we have to do is bury him.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.120
No one will ever be the wiser.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.902
- I'm surprised that
it's this difficult.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.371
- What did you expect?

13:26.373 --> 13:29.440
We throw for distance,
not to hit a target.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.411
- Please, please,
let this be the last round.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.515
- Stand back.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.861
- Oh! Very good.

13:49.863 --> 13:50.862
- Finally.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.800
The javelin has just fallen
to the side, sir.

13:55.902 --> 13:58.202
- Yes, once the javelin made
contact with the breastplate,

13:58.304 --> 14:00.338
It simply bounced off.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.606
- Can I have my javelin
back now?

14:02.609 --> 14:04.275
- Well, yes, of course.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.211
- Fifteenth time's
the charm, eh?

14:09.549 --> 14:13.751
- So, the javelin could not have
penetrated the breastplate

14:13.753 --> 14:15.620
With the amount of force

14:15.722 --> 14:18.956
Generated by a normal
javelin throw.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.893
- So, the javelin that killed
scorch wasn't thrown.

14:21.994 --> 14:26.096
- No. It was run through
his chest with deliberate force.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.498
This was murder.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.309
- So, a group of drunken
sprinters start throwing
javelins around,

14:38.411 --> 14:41.980
Our victim arrives
and someone runs him through.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.582
- Which means either
some unknown person

14:44.584 --> 14:46.651
Was with mr. Scorch,

14:46.752 --> 14:49.253
Picked up an errant javelin
and killed him...

14:49.255 --> 14:50.521
- Or?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.990
- Or our sprinters are lying.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.125
- Sirs.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.460
The lads have finished
searching mr. Scorch's rooms.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.595
They found this.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.864
- Newspaper clippings.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.333
- Mr. Scorch was keeping a keen
eye on the competition.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.703
- That's clearly walter knox.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.040
But it says peter smith.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.910
- There he is again.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.113
- And this one says fred taylor.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.814
- A man of many names?

15:17.317 --> 15:19.550
- Bring him in, henry.
- Sir.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.752
- By the looks of things,
mr. Knox,

15:21.755 --> 15:23.421
You've been going
from town to town

15:23.523 --> 15:25.156
Competing under fake names.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.957
- Is that a crime, officer?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.492
- You're a bloody shark.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.628
Challenging locals
to race for money.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.831
- I simply enjoy every aspect
of competition.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.332
- Don't get cute.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.702
The olympics is only
for amateur athletes.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.171
Racing for money would make you
a professional.

15:40.272 --> 15:43.207
- Even if you are using
fake names.

15:43.209 --> 15:46.077
- Exposing this would disqualify
you from the olympics.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.979
- And mr. Scorch
was on to you.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.381
- You killed him to keep
your secret.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.916
- I didn't kill him.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.587
I didn't even know that he knew
about my enterprise.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.122
That snake.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.925
- Why would he go to such great
lengths to blackmail you

16:01.928 --> 16:04.128
And potentially exclude you
from competition?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.731
- Because if you want to get
to the olympic games,

16:06.733 --> 16:09.734
You have to put on
a good showing at these
demonstration meets.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.135
- I've been to the olympics.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.603
It's not all
it's cracked up to be.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.206
- Well, us athletes
don't feel the same.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.410
A lot of the men here
would do anything to compete
at the olympic games.

16:19.412 --> 16:23.047
Men like scorch,
or that armstrong-howard,

16:23.049 --> 16:24.849
He's the most desperate of all.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.418
- What makes
mr. Armstrong-howard
so desperate?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.554
- Chip on his shoulder.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.823
He's always whining
that he has an unfair lot
'cause he's coloured.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.461
- Maybe he has a point?
- No, he doesn't.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.096
Canada's never sent
a coloured man

16:39.198 --> 16:41.666
To the olympic games because
none of them are good enough.

16:43.136 --> 16:47.571
- Be that as it may, a dead man
was collecting evidence

16:47.673 --> 16:50.641
That could have ruined
your amateur athlete career.

16:51.144 --> 16:54.245
So, you can see why you make
a most compelling suspect.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.448
- If I killed him
to keep this quiet,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.218
Why wouldn't I have destroyed
the clippings, too?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.655
- Look at this beauty.

17:04.657 --> 17:08.026
The finest cut of beef
from the butcher's shop.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.827
- Must have cost a pretty penny.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.929
- Oh, indeed it did.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.466
- How about I carve it for you?
- Uh-uh-uh.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.536
I'd like violet to carve
the roast for me,

17:18.637 --> 17:20.938
Just like old times.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.544
- I wish you didn't force us
to fire all of the staff.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.080
- Would you rather your little
secret got out?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.015
You know, botching
my murder and all.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.122
What are you waiting for,
sweetheart?

17:38.124 --> 17:39.557
Haven't got all day.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.226
Ah.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.963
Now carve a big ole piece
for your dear old dad.

17:46.900 --> 17:47.999
(sighing)

17:50.436 --> 17:52.370
Oh, my!

17:53.106 --> 17:54.872
(indistinct chatter)

17:59.345 --> 18:00.645
- Sir.
- Ah, henry.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.381
I'm just preparing mr. Knox's
release forms.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.049
Could you please fetch him
from the cells?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.283
- Uh, right away, sir.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.985
I'm just gonna put
constable buster away.

18:07.987 --> 18:08.920
- Right.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.321
- Oh.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.524
Okay.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.660
Sure it'll snap back on, sir.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.462
Uh, all right, buster.

18:19.065 --> 18:19.931
Whoop.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.432
All right.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.534
All right.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.437
All right, no. Ugh.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.107
(groaning)
that's not right.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.481
- Henry! Just... Just leave it
and fetch mr. Knox.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.483
I'll take care of it later.
- It's all right, sir.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.286
I think... Think I've got him.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.155
- Fine work.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.297
- Ah, murdoch.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.765
What have you done
with our suspect?

18:54.767 --> 18:56.767
- I've released him, sir.
- Oh, that's a shame.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.704
I don't like him one bit.
- I can't say I do either.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.839
But the question does
loom large:

19:01.941 --> 19:04.041
Why kill someone
to keep a secret

19:04.043 --> 19:06.110
And then not destroy evidence?

19:06.112 --> 19:07.645
- Hm, of course.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.580
Well, if it wasn't him,
then who was it?

19:09.682 --> 19:12.583
One of the other sprinters
trying to eliminate the
competition?

19:13.019 --> 19:15.319
- I'd like to speak with
mr. Armstrong-howard.

19:15.421 --> 19:16.888
- Right then.
Bring him in.

19:17.623 --> 19:20.525
- Oh! Mr. Anderson,
you came.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.295
- Just here to collect my due,
detective.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.463
- Who's this then?

19:25.565 --> 19:29.133
- Mr. Anderson here owns
the variety store on adelaide.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.402
- Ah, the easy breezy
variety store?

19:31.503 --> 19:32.936
- Yup, that's the one.

19:32.939 --> 19:36.941
- So, last week reggie mcfarland
stole from mr. Anderson's shop.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.477
- Uh, that rascal's been
running amok for months.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.678
None of our men have been able
to catch him.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.615
- Well, mr. Anderson here
ran him down.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.884
Witnesses say he's as fast
as a lightning bolt.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.152
- Faster.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.488
Old sticky fingers
didn't stand a chance.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.156
- Huh, brilliant.

19:52.258 --> 19:53.690
There's a reward for that one,
isn't there?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.125
- That's what I'm here
to collect.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.027
- Ah.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.161
- Here you are.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.496
- Mm-hmm.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.098
- If you're that fast,
you should test your mettle

20:01.100 --> 20:02.300
In the track and field
meet today.

20:02.401 --> 20:06.236
- Oh, yes! You could compete
in the 100 or 200-metre dash.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.838
I imagine you would do
very well.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.173
- How fast are
those boys running?

20:09.275 --> 20:11.441
- Some of the men
are running the 100 metres

20:11.444 --> 20:13.043
In under eleven seconds.
- Eleven seconds.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.511
- Eleven seconds?

20:14.613 --> 20:15.646
Come on.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.182
- You think you could run it
faster than that?

20:18.284 --> 20:21.118
- When those boys break
ten seconds, give me a call.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.020
I'll give them the race
of their life.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.160
(both): Ten seconds?!

20:31.464 --> 20:33.264
- Why should we be
at his beck and call?

20:33.366 --> 20:34.732
We aren't servants.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.301
He's jerking us around like
puppets on a string!

20:40.940 --> 20:42.740
- I purchased it this morning.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.410
- Are you sure?
- Quite serious.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.846
It'll all be done soon.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.082
- And everything will be back
to normal again.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.652
- Finally realized
what's important.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.255
Being a man.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.457
For you.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.498
- Walter knox told us that
you are desperate to win

21:07.599 --> 21:10.601
The 100-metre dash so you'll be
considered for the olympics.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.836
- Pretty high stakes,

21:12.938 --> 21:15.773
Especially for a coloured man
hoping to represent canada.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.374
- Unbelievable.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.644
Knox uses any opportunity
to throw dirt on my name.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.246
- Have you been trying
to knock out your competition?

21:23.249 --> 21:24.582
- Why would I need to?

21:24.684 --> 21:27.117
None of these men have
ever beat me in a foot race.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.318
- Oh?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.588
- Look, I might not be
as loud as scorch,

21:30.690 --> 21:33.290
Or as seasoned as knox,
but I have proven myself

21:33.293 --> 21:37.194
To be the best in the field
with actual results, no talk.

21:37.196 --> 21:39.129
- But is it true that you need
to win today's race

21:39.231 --> 21:40.197
To go to the olympics?

21:40.899 --> 21:43.867
Perhaps you needed scorch out of
the way to guarantee your win?

21:43.870 --> 21:45.336
- Guarantee?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.204
Guarantee?

21:47.206 --> 21:48.806
I have no guarantee.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.675
You really think winning
this race is gonna make
any difference?

21:51.677 --> 21:53.277
Win one race, win two,

21:53.379 --> 21:55.079
That's not gonna change
anybody's mind.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.215
People like walter knox will
never think I'm good enough,

21:58.317 --> 22:00.484
No matter what I do.
- Begging your pardon,

22:00.586 --> 22:03.421
But isn't that even more reason
to get your competitors

22:03.423 --> 22:05.323
Out of the way?
- You're not hearing me.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.491
I'm a coloured man.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.160
I could be the last runner
in all of canada

22:10.163 --> 22:11.629
And still stay home.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.065
I'm not stupid enough
to kill another competitor

22:14.166 --> 22:17.134
And assume I'll be on easy
street to the olympic games.

22:21.974 --> 22:25.309
- They characterize us
as a bunch of hysterical women.

22:25.411 --> 22:28.078
Nothing about
the organization at all.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.581
- I told you. It's like
talking to a brick wall.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.582
Those men will never
take us seriously!

22:32.585 --> 22:34.251
- We need to do something.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.585
(sighing)

22:35.588 --> 22:37.388
Something to get us
some publicity.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.524
You should enter
that race today.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.893
- But there are no
women's races.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.261
- Just race the men!

22:44.263 --> 22:45.729
- Oh, yes.

22:45.731 --> 22:46.931
I like that!

22:48.367 --> 22:52.069
Dr. Ogden, what on earth
are you feeding your baby?

22:52.538 --> 22:53.804
- Oh!
(chuckling)

22:53.806 --> 22:57.407
It's a hydration draught
my husband concocted

22:57.410 --> 22:59.810
To help susannah recover
from her illness.

23:00.179 --> 23:03.647
It's got potassium and a pinch
of salt and sugar.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.550
It works like a charm
and it's delicious!

23:06.652 --> 23:07.685
Would you like to try some?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.453
It's blueberry flavoured.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.956
- Um, maybe another time.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.691
(phone ringing)

23:13.793 --> 23:14.825
- Excuse me.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.029
Hello?
Dr. Julia ogden.

23:19.998 --> 23:21.699
Oh, mrs. Hart.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.901
- I started with algor mortis
for time of death,

23:24.003 --> 23:26.236
Which indicated the victim
had died ten hours

23:26.239 --> 23:27.938
Prior to discovery, but...

23:28.674 --> 23:29.640
- Yes?

23:29.742 --> 23:32.242
- Um, there were
some inconsistencies

23:32.245 --> 23:34.178
When I tested the stomach
contents later on.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.647
- Is everything all right,
mrs. Hart?

23:36.748 --> 23:39.049
- Oh! Quite fine.
Just tired.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.586
Oh. Here we are.

23:42.688 --> 23:43.954
Please take a look.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.860
The food is broken down
less than it should be

23:49.962 --> 23:51.595
For a ten-hour timeframe.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.798
- So your estimated
time of death is off?

23:53.899 --> 23:54.731
- Yes.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.266
The stomach contents suggest

23:56.269 --> 23:58.736
The victim died only eight hours
prior to discovery.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.604
- Hm, how curious.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.374
I do love a deathly conundrum.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.009
Oh, what is that?

24:06.512 --> 24:08.012
- What?
- Look.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.451
- Oh! Something has separated.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.420
- Mercury?

24:16.522 --> 24:17.621
- Precisely.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.356
- Found in the victim's
stomach contents.

24:20.827 --> 24:24.562
- Could it have been
an ingredient in a tincture
of some sort?

24:24.564 --> 24:27.564
- Well, I've seen it in all
kinds of remedies and medicines.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.034
I wouldn't be at all surprised
if athletes thought

24:30.036 --> 24:31.835
A small amount might
help them run faster.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.437
- But this was no small amount.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.306
We believe he was poisoned.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.313
(suspenseful music)

24:59.665 --> 25:00.531
(grunts)

25:17.382 --> 25:19.550
(indistinct chatter)

25:38.537 --> 25:40.070
- What's this all about?

25:40.172 --> 25:41.438
- You, be quiet.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.774
One of you is a killer and
we're going to find out who.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.242
- Timothy, what's happening?

25:45.244 --> 25:46.910
- They haven't told us
anything, father.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.245
- This is ridiculous.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.980
You have no right to be going
through their things.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.649
- Step back, sir. Don't
interfere with police procedure.

25:52.751 --> 25:54.018
- Just tell us
what you're looking for

25:54.020 --> 25:55.419
And we'll point you
in the right direction.

25:55.521 --> 25:56.787
- Mind your own business.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.522
- Nothing here, sirs.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.058
- Inspector.

26:01.159 --> 26:02.459
- What is it?

26:03.895 --> 26:07.064
- I saw mr. Archibald using this
to move equipment earlier.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.065
Look.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.500
- Blood.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.536
Do you think the killer used
this to move the body?

26:12.538 --> 26:14.471
- It certainly would explain
why no one heard

26:14.473 --> 26:17.141
A murder being committed
out in the middle of the field.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.341
- Hey!

26:18.344 --> 26:20.010
How long will this take?

26:20.012 --> 26:21.946
Can I get into the cold cure
in the meantime?

26:22.047 --> 26:23.413
We just finished the prelims.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.714
- Yeah, the finals
are coming up next

26:24.717 --> 26:25.883
And I need to get ready.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.785
- Hold your horses.
We'll be done soon enough.

26:27.886 --> 26:28.719
- Sirs.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.521
Have a look at this.

26:38.063 --> 26:39.163
- Mercury.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.400
You are coming with us, sir.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.376
- This is ridiculous!

26:52.477 --> 26:54.044
- Mr. Irons, please calm down.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.912
- Calm down?
You're harassing my son

26:55.915 --> 26:57.915
And right before his race,
no less.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.650
- I told you, sir,
the detective just has

26:59.751 --> 27:01.452
A few questions
and if all is well,

27:01.553 --> 27:03.787
Your son will be free to go.
- We don't have time for this.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.389
His race is at four o'clock
and he still has to have
his warm-up massage.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.858
- Sir, please!

27:07.860 --> 27:10.226
- I will not allow
you blundering brigadiers

27:10.229 --> 27:14.064
To distract my son and disrupt
his competitive temperament!

27:15.101 --> 27:17.267
- Yes. I gave him
a little quicksilver,

27:17.269 --> 27:18.535
But it was just
to slow him down.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.270
There's no way
that's what killed him.

27:20.272 --> 27:21.805
- But he is dead.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.408
And you've just admitted to
being the one who poisoned him.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.744
- But it can't be!
I didn't mean to kill him.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.147
Scorch and I have always
had this tit-for-tat,

27:30.249 --> 27:31.614
But I never hated him.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.350
It was more
of a spirited rivalry.

27:33.352 --> 27:36.219
- A rivalry that included
poisoning?

27:36.321 --> 27:38.555
- You'd have to be a sportsman
to understand.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.158
I did no less than what
he's done to me time after time.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.727
- You're saying mr. Scorch
has poisoned you in the past?

27:43.729 --> 27:44.995
- Not just me.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.396
He did it all the time.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.298
He'd poison the entire field
and walk to victory.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.367
Don't you see?
I was just getting back at him.

27:50.469 --> 27:53.837
And I swear I only
gave him enough to make him
queasy and sluggish.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.240
- Be that as it may,
he is dead.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.042
So you will be kept in our cells

27:59.044 --> 28:01.145
Until charges can be
brought against you.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.082
- But what about the race?

28:07.586 --> 28:09.853
(classical music playing)

28:48.060 --> 28:49.960
(dramatic music)

28:55.267 --> 28:56.166
(gunshot)

28:57.236 --> 28:58.302
(knocking on door)

28:59.438 --> 29:01.171
- Mrs. Hart. You called?

29:01.173 --> 29:02.705
- Oh, we did.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.641
There's been something
of a revelation.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.309
- We?

29:06.411 --> 29:08.111
- Dr. Ogden and I
have been working

29:08.113 --> 29:09.913
On confirming
the cause of death.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.248
- William!

29:11.250 --> 29:13.884
Mr. Scorch definitely suffered
mercury poisoning.

29:13.986 --> 29:17.321
It caused kidney damage and
a unique rash on his upper body.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.122
- But that isn't
the whole story.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.792
- There's a second, very
distinctive rash on his leg.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.929
- In addition, found
a significant amount

29:26.031 --> 29:28.731
Of bloody discolouration in
the synovial fluid in his knees.

29:28.734 --> 29:31.001
- He was an athlete.
It could have been an injury.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.669
- I initially thought the same,

29:32.771 --> 29:33.970
But, along with
the other symptoms,

29:33.973 --> 29:35.405
It suggests something else.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.474
- Biggest curiosity
was the presence of urine

29:37.476 --> 29:39.409
In the interstitial tissue.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.345
- Urine? How odd.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.213
- It's called cold diuresis.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.415
When the body is trying
to preserve warmth,

29:45.417 --> 29:46.817
The blood vessels constrict

29:46.918 --> 29:49.019
And the kidneys purge
all unnecessary fluid.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.488
- It results in a large
production of urine.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.156
When the bladder becomes full,

29:53.158 --> 29:54.424
The urine has nowhere to go

29:54.426 --> 29:56.527
And so it seeps into
the surrounding tissue.

29:57.829 --> 30:01.298
- A rash, hemorrhaging,
cold diuresis.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.899
What does this all mean?

30:02.902 --> 30:06.369
- In combination, they occur
in only one specific instance.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.973
This man wasn't poisoned,
he died of hypothermia.

30:13.813 --> 30:14.911
- Let's go, timothy.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.713
We've wasted enough time
here already.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.782
- Ah, not so fast, mr. Irons.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.986
Although I no longer believe
your son killed mr. Scorch,

30:23.088 --> 30:25.922
He has admitted to intentionally
poisoning him.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.525
- I told you. It was nothing
more than he'd done to me.

30:29.194 --> 30:30.594
- A crime, nonetheless.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.828
- You have to let him race.

30:31.831 --> 30:35.599
- I intend to, as a gesture
of good will.

30:35.968 --> 30:39.036
However, I do need
your help, mr. Irons.

30:40.306 --> 30:44.540
Mr. Knox mentioned
taking a cold cure.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.542
I need you to tell me
what that is?

30:46.545 --> 30:48.611
- I can do you one better.

30:48.614 --> 30:49.746
I'll show you.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.515
The cold cure
is coach kittering's

30:52.518 --> 30:54.351
Revolutionary
after-workout therapy.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.620
You fill a wooden barrel
with water and ice.

30:56.721 --> 30:58.588
After a hard practice,
you submerge yourself

30:58.690 --> 31:00.090
To your neck for 10 minutes.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.025
Afterwards, your body
comes out refreshed.

31:02.127 --> 31:05.161
- I suppose reducing swelling
and muscle damage

31:05.164 --> 31:07.497
Would aid the body's ability
to recover.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.432
- Ridiculous.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.500
Kittering doesn't know
what's what.

31:10.502 --> 31:11.768
Cold's no good for muscles.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.237
Hot massages are a far more
effective therapy.

31:14.339 --> 31:15.905
- Truly. Whenever I get
into the cold cure,

31:15.908 --> 31:17.574
I feel like I might have
a heart attack.

31:26.184 --> 31:28.385
- Hm, scratches.

31:28.486 --> 31:29.453
- What?

31:29.554 --> 31:32.789
- We found splinters under
scorch's fingernails.

31:33.358 --> 31:37.261
Perhaps someone held him down
in the water with this lid.

31:41.366 --> 31:42.865
- Ah, coach kittering.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.201
A word, please?

31:46.505 --> 31:48.472
(door closing)
- arthur?

31:49.308 --> 31:51.008
Oh, there you are.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.911
You didn't do it, did you?
(gasps)

31:55.147 --> 31:56.212
Arthur!

31:56.215 --> 31:57.281
Arthur!

31:59.250 --> 32:01.551
- And what exactly
was he supposed to do?

32:01.653 --> 32:03.286
I mean, if it's any consolation,

32:03.289 --> 32:05.888
I can help do whatever
needs doing.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.224
- You killed him.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.292
- What does it look like?

32:09.194 --> 32:11.061
I got rid of a problem.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.031
(gasps)

32:16.468 --> 32:20.570
You should never have sent a boy
to do a man's job.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.074
(eerie music)

32:28.781 --> 32:31.181
- Of course, I knew you two
were plotting to kill me.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.518
Every chance you got
huddled together,

32:34.619 --> 32:36.786
Whispering so loudly,

32:36.888 --> 32:38.321
The deaf man across the street

32:38.323 --> 32:39.722
Probably knew
what you were up to.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.059
- If you knew, why didn't you
do something?

32:42.160 --> 32:45.062
- And miss out on the chance of
watching you two bumble about?

32:45.163 --> 32:47.864
Oh, no.
I quite enjoyed the show.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.199
- What happened?

32:49.201 --> 32:52.602
- I was sitting in the parlour
minding my god-given business

32:52.604 --> 32:54.805
When I see this fool
in the mirror

32:54.807 --> 32:57.106
Creeping up behind me,
gun drawn.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.209
I did what I had to do.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.344
It was self-defence, sweetheart.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.279
- You could have easily
overpowered him.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.748
You didn't have to kill him!

33:04.750 --> 33:07.317
- Why wouldn't I?
Why shouldn't I?

33:07.319 --> 33:10.887
If he was gonna keep trying to
get rid of me, then fair game.

33:12.691 --> 33:16.159
Now, what to do... About you?

33:21.700 --> 33:23.734
(gasps)

33:36.382 --> 33:37.381
Do it.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.665
Hmm.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.937
Ever the failure, violet.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.548
Now what do you suppose we do
about poor old arthur here?

34:15.587 --> 34:17.054
(crying)

34:20.325 --> 34:21.725
- Mr. Kittering.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.628
Mr. Scorch died of hypothermia

34:25.631 --> 34:29.633
Caused by being held down inside
one of your cold cure barrels.

34:30.735 --> 34:34.171
The temperature in the barrel
today is about 45 degrees.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.839
It would have taken
approximately one hour

34:36.842 --> 34:39.442
For mr. Scorch
to lose consciousness

34:39.445 --> 34:41.378
And subsequently die.

34:42.113 --> 34:43.914
- Yes, well...
(scoffs)

34:44.516 --> 34:45.782
All right.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.584
Perhaps 45 degrees
is a tad too cold.

34:48.587 --> 34:52.222
- Perhaps... This is your moment
to be truthful.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.731
- I found scorch dead
in the barrel.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.867
I didn't know what to do.

35:03.969 --> 35:06.636
But I did know that...
That if his death

35:06.638 --> 35:08.538
Was tied to my cold cure remedy,

35:08.640 --> 35:10.874
That would be
the end of my therapy,

35:10.876 --> 35:13.410
My club and my career
as a coach.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.711
So I panicked.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.482
- You covered it up.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.020
- The sprinters were out
on the field playing around

35:24.022 --> 35:26.790
With the javelins, and,
so when they left...

35:28.427 --> 35:30.694
I redressed scorch's body.

35:31.596 --> 35:34.231
I put it in the wagon and
I brought it out onto the field.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.700
- Once the body was out there,

35:37.703 --> 35:39.836
You ran it through
with the javelin.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.308
- I wanted to make it look
like an accident.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.710
- To make it appear as though
one of the sprinters

35:47.713 --> 35:48.645
Had done it?

35:49.247 --> 35:53.450
- Yes, but I didn't intend any
of them to be blamed for it.

35:54.252 --> 35:55.986
I was just trying
to protect myself.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.390
You have to believe me.
I didn't kill him.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.125
I covered it up,
but I didn't kill him.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.193
I'm innocent!

36:04.263 --> 36:08.231
- Innocent might not be the word
I would use, mr. Kittering.

36:11.769 --> 36:13.737
- And the purpose of this, sir?

36:13.838 --> 36:15.939
- We need to determine exactly
how the victim was held down

36:16.041 --> 36:18.074
Inside the cold cure barrel.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.676
Now kneel down, henry.
- Sir?

36:19.777 --> 36:21.111
- Get on with it, higgins.

36:21.113 --> 36:22.445
You're not in any real distress.

36:22.547 --> 36:24.080
- That's what you think.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.348
- All right.

36:27.219 --> 36:31.354
Now, henry, push up
with all of your might.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.490
(banging)

36:34.493 --> 36:36.259
Hm. All right.

36:36.862 --> 36:37.861
All right!

36:38.796 --> 36:40.830
Ugh. What is that?

36:40.832 --> 36:41.965
- What's wrong, murdoch?

36:42.066 --> 36:44.300
- Someone has gotten oil, or...

36:44.403 --> 36:46.002
Something on the handle.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.641
Hm. Smells like
mentholated ointment.

36:51.743 --> 36:52.842
- Hm. Pungent.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.911
- Julia used something like this

36:54.913 --> 36:56.846
With susannah when
she was ill recently.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.448
- Um, sirs?

36:58.550 --> 37:00.516
- Yes, higgins, you can get out.

37:00.618 --> 37:03.052
- No, no, no. I came across
an ointment like that myself.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.121
Uh, there was a jar of it
in timothy irons' locker.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.260
- It's a special heated ointment
my father makes himself.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.662
He uses it when he gives me
my race massages.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.398
- We found traces of it
on the cold cure barrel

37:15.500 --> 37:17.667
In the locker room where
mr. Scorch was killed.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.002
- I didn't kill him.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.470
He was alive when I left
the track

37:20.571 --> 37:22.739
And I was with the 100-metre men
for the rest of the night.

37:22.741 --> 37:23.907
You can ask them.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.375
- You could have slipped
away unnoticed.

37:25.476 --> 37:26.876
- Well, ask my father then.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.978
He stayed behind to pack up
my things and lock up.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.747
I didn't get back 'til 1:00 am.

37:31.482 --> 37:32.549
You finished?

37:32.651 --> 37:34.751
I have a race to run.
- For now.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.957
Mr. Irons is the only person
who uses that ointment.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.326
- Not quite.
There is one other.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.069
- Are you sure about this?

37:53.071 --> 37:54.137
- We'll see.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.641
(clears throat)

37:59.678 --> 38:00.977
- What are you doing?

38:00.979 --> 38:02.111
- Racing.

38:02.114 --> 38:04.246
- You most certainly are not.

38:04.249 --> 38:06.116
- Ay, ay.
What's all this then?

38:07.619 --> 38:08.918
- What on earth?

38:09.554 --> 38:10.587
(clears throat)

38:12.391 --> 38:15.458
- Miss roswell, please step
back!

38:16.194 --> 38:17.327
- No!

38:24.168 --> 38:25.802
- Why are you bothering me?

38:25.903 --> 38:27.870
I'm here to see my son race.

38:28.173 --> 38:32.075
- Mr. Irons, what time did you
pack up on Friday evening

38:32.077 --> 38:34.010
And what time did you leave?

38:34.012 --> 38:36.012
- Packing up didn't take long.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.481
I left shortly after timothy.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.783
- Was there anyone else
left at the track?

38:40.786 --> 38:42.218
- Not that I saw.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.221
- Did you happen to touch

38:45.223 --> 38:47.891
The cold cure barrels
at any point?

38:49.161 --> 38:51.360
- No.
- Then how do you explain us

38:51.363 --> 38:54.430
Finding a smear of your special
mentholated ointment

38:54.433 --> 38:55.699
On the one of the handles?

38:56.968 --> 39:00.670
- Gentlemen, please escort
miss roswell from the track.

39:01.839 --> 39:06.442
- Again, I ask you,
did you have cause to touch
the cold cure barrels?

39:06.445 --> 39:09.679
- Especially when you said
yourself the treatment
didn't work.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.782
- You keep your hands off her!

39:12.784 --> 39:14.117
- Murdoch, get him.

39:14.218 --> 39:15.585
- Get off of me!

39:17.389 --> 39:19.289
(epic music)

39:24.495 --> 39:25.495
(screaming)

39:27.699 --> 39:29.232
(chuckling)

39:32.704 --> 39:34.270
- Much obliged, miss roswell.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.472
- My pleasure.

39:39.243 --> 39:42.746
- Mr. Irons, you are
under arrest for murder.

39:50.688 --> 39:52.021
Why would you do this?

39:52.123 --> 39:53.957
Just so your son could win?

39:54.058 --> 39:56.025
- You would snuff out
a young athlete

39:56.027 --> 39:58.094
In the prime of his career
just for a race?

39:58.096 --> 39:59.962
- I would do anything
for my son.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.364
- Including murder?

40:02.133 --> 40:05.635
- Timothy was the best until
scorch started poisoning him.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.771
That mercury stuff
permanently messed him up.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.840
- The poison had
lasting effects?

40:11.810 --> 40:14.710
- After the sabotage,
timothy tried to get back

40:14.713 --> 40:16.379
Into the swing of things.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.581
He never regained
his full strength.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.383
- Over time, mercury can damage
motor skills

40:21.386 --> 40:23.186
And cause irreparable
lung damage.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.788
- The last straw
was that shameless cur boasting

40:25.890 --> 40:27.891
At the press conference
after all he'd done.

40:29.261 --> 40:33.329
He was no champion,
he was a fraud.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.598
- And you are now a murderer.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.639
(indistinct chatter)

40:47.245 --> 40:49.446
- I suppose we can see
what she can do.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.182
- On your marks.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.351
Get set.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.520
And... Go!
(gunshot)

40:59.290 --> 41:00.623
(panting)

41:01.392 --> 41:02.759
- Go iggy!

41:18.577 --> 41:20.076
(applause)

41:21.946 --> 41:23.579
- Wow.
(chuckling)

41:23.681 --> 41:26.015
A very fast time
for miss roswell.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.917
Better than some
of the men I coach.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.184
- And the women?

41:29.820 --> 41:31.955
- I have no idea how fast
a woman can run.

41:32.056 --> 41:33.256
(scoffs)

41:33.357 --> 41:35.725
- Well, hopefully you'll find
that out one day

41:35.826 --> 41:37.827
When we are finally invited
to the games.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.196
- Then I await that day.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.202
- Who was that lady?

41:47.205 --> 41:48.871
- Oh, that's miss iggy roswell.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.607
- She's so fast.
- She certainly is.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.876
What's your name?
- Myrtle cook.

41:52.977 --> 41:55.311
One day, I'm going to be
just like her.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.484
You were amazing.

42:01.586 --> 42:02.885
- I came last.

42:02.887 --> 42:04.620
- You were still amazing.

42:04.722 --> 42:06.422
- I'd have to say
I agree with her.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.359
- Well, thank you.
I am quite thirsty, though.

42:09.460 --> 42:10.493
- Oh!

42:10.595 --> 42:12.428
Really, you should try this.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.031
- Is that the baby's drink?

42:15.132 --> 42:17.299
- Yes, but it's rich
with electrolytes.

42:17.302 --> 42:19.903
It'll help you replenish
the fluids that you've lost.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.576
- Wow! What a thirst quencher.

42:26.578 --> 42:28.111
This could really catch on.

42:28.113 --> 42:29.212
- Have some more!

42:49.300 --> 42:51.367
- So sweet of you to take care
of your husband.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.437
I'm sure he's resting in peace.

42:55.773 --> 42:58.207
Fitting that he's buried
where he planned to bury me.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.811
- And what do you have
planned for me?

43:03.981 --> 43:05.648
- I guess I'll keep you around.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.618
- I could give you
all the money.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.688
I'll start over.
- Ah, no need for all that.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.892
All I ask is that you do me
one favour.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.228
Don't ever try
to kill me again.

43:20.865 --> 43:21.731
Yeah.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.467
Your prints are all over this.

43:25.670 --> 43:26.869
So play nice.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.539
You and me?

43:33.378 --> 43:35.645
Together, we're gonna tear up
this town.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.349
Hmm.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.686
Subtitling: Difuze
