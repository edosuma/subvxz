WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.880
'It's a program called Kaspion, a web crawler.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.760
'You can let yourself into any flawed system.'

00:05.760 --> 00:07.600
You can spy, you can steal, control,

00:07.600 --> 00:09.600
or destroy.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.240
And I put it in Roth's hands.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.320
'It gets worse.'

00:12.320 --> 00:15.320
Just after the breach into OCO, Roth's wife was shot

00:15.320 --> 00:16.480
at a demonstration.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.800
Jesus Christ!

00:18.800 --> 00:20.800
She needs help! Please!

00:22.000 --> 00:23.760
'Why didn't they just let him in?'

00:23.760 --> 00:26.640
You have a meeting to finalise the Helmston Mine lease

00:26.640 --> 00:28.600
before tomorrow's signing.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.120
This incident will get a full investigation,

00:31.120 --> 00:32.400
but it's not a roadblock.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.920
Get that lease signed.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.320
'If you want in, cool.'

00:35.320 --> 00:37.920
If not, you and your brother can just wander off.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.840
But you cannot take this away from me.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.640
'If I destroy the program,'

00:42.640 --> 00:45.480
what kind of guarantee do I get that we're going to be OK?

00:45.480 --> 00:47.840
I don't want you to destroy the program.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.600
I want you to bring it to me.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.280
- There are more patrols on the road. We have to get out now. 
- I'll get the stuff.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.520
I'll meet you there. Go.

01:21.840 --> 01:28.680
This programme contains some strong language.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.360
I need you to slow down, Jesse.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.200
Take a deep breath and start again.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.240
I want Hani's father released now.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.720
Not just a promise of help.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.560
I want to see him walking out of there.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.240
I don't think you took that breath.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.480
I'm assuming the fact that you're delivering

02:51.480 --> 02:53.240
such strident demands can only mean

02:53.240 --> 02:55.480
that you have the Kaspion program?

02:55.480 --> 02:56.880
I've got it.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.240
But I'm not delivering until Nasim is released.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.040
Things have moved on since we spoke.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.160
Right now, the only thing I might be in a position to do

03:07.160 --> 03:09.040
is stop someone putting a bullet in your head.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.760
Don't misunderstand me.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.000
I very much want to work this out with you, Jesse.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.840
I have put a lot of effort

03:15.840 --> 03:17.920
into trying to work this out with you.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.840
But, Nasim, that horse has bolted.

03:22.040 --> 03:25.760
And what's left? What's left is your life.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.160
Jesse.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.000
Jesse!

03:43.280 --> 03:44.680
I'm here.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.520
I thought we'd lost you. Hey?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.280
Did you get it?

03:58.600 --> 04:00.080
No.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.080
Jan! We have to go!

04:15.960 --> 04:22.720
WOMAN SINGS

04:22.720 --> 04:30.080
OTHERS JOIN IN

04:30.080 --> 04:34.520
SINGING CONTINUES

05:05.960 --> 05:07.640
Jesse.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.760
SINGING

07:12.360 --> 07:14.360
Join them up, Papa.

07:24.520 --> 07:28.560
Um, I'm sorry, I... I was a bit overwhelmed.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.040
I didn't realise you were here.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.000
- Jesse. 
- No, no.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.800
Jesse.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.000
When I was growing up,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.880
my best friend was this Aboriginal kid.

07:47.880 --> 07:52.080
He used to show me the burial trees behind where we lived.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.240
I'm not a believer, but...

08:01.880 --> 08:03.600
..somehow it seems right.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.680
Something living... marks that they were here.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.200
What was his name? Your son?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.720
Carlo.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.800
Pneumonia.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.040
It happened fast.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.440
Fever and this, uh... horrible sound.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.280
Couldn't breathe, so...

08:32.679 --> 08:34.159
..we drove him to the clinic.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.080
I mean, the place is haemorrhaging money.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.000
No doctors, no medicine.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.560
Antibiotics.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.480
One of those half-used packets

08:47.480 --> 08:50.080
that sits in every bathroom across Australia...

08:52.160 --> 08:54.160
..that's all we need.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.880
Do you want a hug?

09:05.520 --> 09:07.040
No.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.560
But I appreciate the offer.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.360
Sweetie, I've got to, uh...

09:21.760 --> 09:24.160
I have to go away for work for a couple of days.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.840
- I want to come with you. 
- Nah. Nah, it'll be boring.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.680
I want a pinkie promise you're coming back.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.960
I, Jan Roth, do solemnly pinkie promise

09:40.960 --> 09:45.200
that not even demons will keep me

09:45.200 --> 09:48.160
from coming to back to Tahila Gangi-Roth

09:48.160 --> 09:50.160
when my work is done.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.320
Hello?

10:28.320 --> 10:31.360
Marina, we need to start getting this out.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.120
What happened on the mine road, to Remsey,

10:34.120 --> 10:36.840
Lara's involvement, the whole thing.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.320
Yeah, um...

10:39.320 --> 10:40.880
There's...

10:40.880 --> 10:46.120
There's a lot going on with the forum coming up.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.240
- Uh, everyone's watching me... 
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.680
No, no, no, no. This is going out.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.680
This is what we're publishing. You can help or not, that's your call,

10:53.680 --> 10:55.520
but you should know I'm going to name you.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.080
Yeah, you can deny it, but I'm not going to skirt around it.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.200
I've let you make me your moral hostage, Ned Banks.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.600
I stepped towards you when I could've stepped away.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.920
Someday I'm going to feel good about that.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.720
I'm sorry.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.920
We can get out, but we have to go now.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.160
All right. OK. I'm going to try and get a message to Ben.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.280
See if he can hold some space for us to get something out today,

11:39.280 --> 11:42.440
then we just have to start pumping it out.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.240
Jess, we have to go.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.640
Clark Kent to the rescue, is it?

11:46.640 --> 11:48.760
If we can prove that Marcus was innocent,

11:48.760 --> 11:51.200
then there's no crime for Remsey to take the blame for.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.280
Right, so you just whip up some expose

11:53.280 --> 11:55.920
and they all come running out with their hands in the air?

11:55.920 --> 11:58.480
- Right? 
- Yep.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.320
That's what I got.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.880
Don't trip over your cape.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.080
Jess.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.200
I'm not going.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.640
'Course you are.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.000
No, I was not asking your permission, Ned,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.480
I'm telling you.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.000
Jesus, Jesse, we can't stand around here for three hours

12:24.000 --> 12:26.480
workshopping it, we have to go.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.120
You have to go.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.840
It's time to cut the cord, Ned.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.880
I'm cutting the cord.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.440
I know you think you're looking out for me,

12:46.440 --> 12:48.240
protecting me.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.240
But I'm suffocating

12:51.240 --> 12:55.480
and I need some air that doesn't have your ideas in it.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.320
I'm sorry.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.080
It's...

13:02.440 --> 13:04.640
It's not you, it's me.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.120
Ned, do you want me to see

13:08.120 --> 13:10.800
if maybe there's someone else you can come with tomorrow?

13:10.800 --> 13:15.000
No, he's going today like he planned.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.240
There you go, me making arbitrary decisions for you for once.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.720
Look after yourself.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.200
You too.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.720
There's something I need to tell you.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.760
I was going to try and trade the program for Hani's dad,

13:56.760 --> 13:59.480
but I've actually failed spectacularly to do that

13:59.480 --> 14:01.560
and in the process I have just confirmed

14:01.560 --> 14:05.200
everything they already thought about me in the first place.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.320
Don't fit in the box.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.960
Will never fit in the box.

14:08.960 --> 14:12.840
Fuck the box. The box is for morons.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.760
You know Lara called off the surveillance?

14:14.760 --> 14:17.320
That's how I got back here.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.960
She wants to keep the Kaspion program for herself.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.600
What do you want?

14:23.920 --> 14:26.200
- I don't know. 
- Yes, you do.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.320
Some things have been done that must be put right.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.880
Ned might rattle his newspaper, turn a few heads, but you...

14:42.880 --> 14:45.760
..you have to put things right in your own way.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.120
But first you have to decide what kind of dog you are.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.960
What kind are you?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.360
I'm the dogs of war.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.680
SIREN BLARES

15:16.680 --> 15:19.840
OVER LOUDSPEAKER: 'Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate.'

15:19.840 --> 15:22.480
'Exit the building and proceed immediately

15:22.480 --> 15:25.720
'to your designated emergency assembly area.'

15:34.920 --> 15:37.320
This morning, during the handover with night shift,

15:37.320 --> 15:38.880
an evacuation was triggered.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.880
Once everyone was out and the gates were locked,

15:41.880 --> 15:44.760
system by system, the operation was shut down.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.840
Then this arrived 20 minutes ago.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.080
Morning, all.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.600
By now you'll be aware

15:50.600 --> 15:52.480
that the wheels of production at Helmston

15:52.480 --> 15:54.160
have ground to a halt.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.080
Mechanical protest against the horror perpetuated in its name.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.120
29 people arrested at Friday's protest need to be released.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.760
Remsey Gangi needs to be released.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.200
Nasim Parande returned.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.360
The mine stays shut until the terms of operation

16:10.360 --> 16:14.640
are renegotiated to reflect a somewhat fairer share of the spoils.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.800
And, of course, the extradition for Jesse and Ned Banks.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.960
So that's part one.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.840
Just something to get us started.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.320
Well, I guess it's safe to say

16:28.320 --> 16:30.360
we now know the Kaspion program works,

16:30.360 --> 16:33.000
sniffed out an A-list target on its first outing.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Alert levels need to be raised,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.040
both in Indonesia and here as well.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.360
Critical infrastructure protocols put into place.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.120
"Do not travel" alerts need to go up today.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.520
But if we get this wrong, we'll have full-blown panic on our hands,

16:45.520 --> 16:47.200
so keep the language tight.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.040
This won't get a public release,

16:50.040 --> 16:52.520
we just proceed with this morning's signing regardless.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.120
You've gotta be kidding.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.680
The company has an obligation to report any adverse events

16:57.680 --> 17:00.480
likely to impact on its value to the ASX.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.040
And they will. But the lease signing goes ahead.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.119
You pull the plug on it now,

17:04.119 --> 17:06.160
you're telling the world that terrorism works.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.680
Business as usual until the situation resolves itself.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.720
Is anyone confused about what that looks like?

17:58.520 --> 18:00.520
I want to stop in at home before the meeting.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.440
We don't have time.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.200
It wasn't a request.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.320
I thought you left two hours ago.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.160
I did. I did.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.520
And I have to go again now, sweetheart.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.560
Listen, I don't know for sure,

18:30.560 --> 18:34.720
but it's possible that I'm going to go to the economic forum today

18:34.720 --> 18:38.040
and decide not to sign a lease worth a truckload of money

18:38.040 --> 18:39.640
to some very powerful people

18:39.640 --> 18:43.400
and I don't know what's going to happen when I decide to do that.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.640
But what I do know is, that scholarship...

18:48.640 --> 18:52.080
it was offered to you for the wrong reasons, as a way to get to me.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.760
CAR HORN BEEPS

19:01.440 --> 19:03.440
Go on, then.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.360
I'm sorry.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.360
Didn't I tell you? The best that money can buy.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.400
You did. That's what you said.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.000
Now...

19:27.200 --> 19:28.680
I need you to add us

19:28.680 --> 19:31.080
to the list of delegates attending the forum today.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.080
You all right?

19:35.080 --> 19:36.600
Um...

19:40.040 --> 19:41.520
..I want to talk to Ned.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.120
Jesse, I need you to climb out of the sandpit.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.960
I just want to make sure we're...

19:45.960 --> 19:48.280
sticking to what we talked about, right?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.400
- No, um... surprises. 
- Right.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.480
No sudden changes of plan, cos I'm...

19:56.880 --> 19:59.640
- No one gets hurt. 
- Right. Just like we talked.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.120
But I need you to commit now,

20:03.120 --> 20:04.400
or walk away.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.680
Good morning, Jacinta.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.920
Welcome. You're very keen.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.920
We're not actually open to the public yet.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.200
The delegates are still having their breakfast meeting.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.440
- That's all right, we're special guests. 
- Hmm.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.680
I'm Jan Roth and this is Jesse Banks.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.840
OK, um...

20:51.840 --> 20:54.640
Hmm, I don't seem to see you here.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.160
Just a sec.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.800
Oh, sorry, I see you've just been added this morning.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.560
Come through.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.680
- I'm afraid you've just missed breakfast. 
- Oh, that's all right.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.080
- METAL DETECTOR BEEPS 
- Oop.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.400
Titanium hip. Happens all the time.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.720
METAL DETECTOR WHIRRS

21:11.720 --> 21:13.800
I need you to do something for me.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.000
I want you to call Mr Muscles over there

21:17.000 --> 21:20.760
and tell him that we have a situation on our hands.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.600
Because we do.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.160
Morning, all.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.600
Change of plan.

21:47.280 --> 21:50.560
Everybody sit. Sit. Please, relax.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.960
I want you to take your cell phones out and place them on the desk,

21:56.960 --> 22:01.240
and I want you to keep your hands where I can see them.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.920
Jacinta...

22:07.320 --> 22:10.200
Now, I want you to go to the door, welcome them.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.560
Once they're inside, run. Run like the wind.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.280
When you get out there, tell them what's happening in here.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.640
R-O-T-H, Roth. Make sure they spell it right.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.840
Go.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.800
Welcome.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.240
Yeah, I told her I was gonna write the stories

22:39.240 --> 22:40.960
with her or without her.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.120
I can feel it, though, she's going to leak it.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.600
And when she does, I'm going to send the documents raw to you

22:45.600 --> 22:47.800
and I'll write the stories around them.

22:47.800 --> 22:52.040
He's saying two pages for copy, but, what, half a page for pics?

22:52.040 --> 22:54.800
Well, it depends if my pictures are decorating your story

22:54.800 --> 22:57.240
or your words are supporting my pictures.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.840
Uh, yeah, a whole page for pics, then.

23:00.840 --> 23:04.120
Yeah. Yeah, they're not bad.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.880
OK, bye.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.520
They're incredible. I'm just strategically underselling them.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.080
Um, you need to get online,

23:13.080 --> 23:16.920
I told him that you'd be uploading them straightaway.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.600
Did he say what he's going to do?

23:20.160 --> 23:22.040
He, uh...

23:23.120 --> 23:25.760
I don't know, Han, maybe this is what he needs,

23:25.760 --> 23:29.160
some time on his own with neither of us trying to steer his ship.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.200
KNOCK AT DOOR

23:55.000 --> 23:57.600
How are we going on those profiles?

23:57.600 --> 24:00.440
I need to know who he's got in there.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.440
Lines three and four can go to the exterior cameras

24:04.440 --> 24:06.560
and the, um...the foyers.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.480
GLASS SMASHES

24:56.200 --> 25:00.280
ROTH: Lara Dixon, I know you can hear me.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.440
Just... Just hear what he's got to say

25:05.440 --> 25:07.880
and, uh, tell him we're going to work with him

25:07.880 --> 25:09.880
to resolve the situation.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.240
Mr Roth.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.000
Regarding the shutdown of the mine,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.600
I just wanted to keep you in the loop.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.800
That is just our opening volley.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.040
Thought about running the whole thing from there,

25:29.040 --> 25:32.960
but then... then it struck me...

25:32.960 --> 25:35.720
who would ever know about it?

25:35.720 --> 25:37.920
You'd pretend to meet the demands,

25:37.920 --> 25:39.760
we come out, bang, gone.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.600
Death grip on the press, nobody would ever hear about it.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.000
The mining company would write off the cost as operational,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.480
and it would be like it never happened.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.240
But here?

25:53.240 --> 25:56.640
Here, not so easy to keep it quiet, is it?

25:56.640 --> 25:58.560
Mr Roth, we're very concerned

25:58.560 --> 26:00.720
about the people that you have with you.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.960
MOBILE PHONE BUZZES

26:05.360 --> 26:07.640
We need to know that they're safe

26:07.640 --> 26:09.960
and then we can talk about what it is that you want.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.640
What I want is for you to meet a demand.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.440
Release Remsey.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.040
15 minutes

26:18.040 --> 26:20.680
or the shit seriously hits the fan around here.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.480
MOBILE PHONE BUZZES

26:25.520 --> 26:28.480
Now, while we're waiting, why don't you tell everybody here

26:28.480 --> 26:31.760
what happened when your men pulled us over on the mine road?

26:37.600 --> 26:40.520
I'm happy to, Mr Roth.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.240
Some new information came to my attention

26:43.240 --> 26:45.560
which implicated one of our security employees,

26:45.560 --> 26:49.520
Daryl Burrows, in the shooting of the Australian surfers.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.560
I informed the Minister of Defence immediately

26:51.560 --> 26:53.080
about what had happened.

26:53.080 --> 26:56.000
We have extremely strict protocols to ensure

26:56.000 --> 26:58.440
that our staff are trained for the pressures that they face,

26:58.440 --> 27:00.520
but no system's perfect.

27:00.520 --> 27:03.480
Sometimes the odd rotten apple slips through.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.120
This is bullshit!

27:05.120 --> 27:07.480
You... you can't wash your hands of this.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.960
You knew exactly what happened and so did Neil.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.320
With respect, Minister...

27:11.320 --> 27:13.560
You both made a decision to sweep it under the carpet.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.880
- Whatever you think's going on... 
- No, no, no. But it just

27:15.880 --> 27:18.120
wouldn't stay there, would it?

27:18.120 --> 27:22.360
Lara, I've copied the security meeting files.

27:22.360 --> 27:25.520
And whatever happens, they're going on the public rec...

27:25.520 --> 27:26.800
VOLUME SWITCHED OFF

27:43.360 --> 27:44.960
I know what happened to your wife.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.600
I know what happened and...

27:50.080 --> 27:51.520
I understand.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.920
My daughter was...

27:56.040 --> 27:57.600
She was in a car.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.120
She... She was parked behind a van that exploded.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.240
She's got scars all down her back

28:05.240 --> 28:08.280
and all over her soul that will never go away.

28:11.160 --> 28:14.680
And the changes that he wanted, that man who blew up the van,

28:14.680 --> 28:17.040
they didn't happen, nothing changed.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.480
Please, I'm...

28:23.480 --> 28:25.400
I'm not going to sign the lease.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.120
I'm not.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.960
They'll sack me.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.520
But I won't do it. I won't go quietly.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.680
I can help you.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.200
I can help you, but not like this.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.880
You do what you've got to do, sweetie.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.080
I'm going to do what I need to do.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.760
WHEEZING

29:04.640 --> 29:07.240
She needs a puffer. She has very bad asthma.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.880
WHEEZING CONTINUES

29:11.680 --> 29:14.600
You're all right. All right, just breathe slowly.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.520
Come on, breathe slowly. Hold my hand.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.280
Have you got a puffer?

29:23.280 --> 29:24.440
No, no puffer.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.680
Jan, she can't breathe. We have to let her go.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.320
Then maybe she needs to feel what it's like

29:29.320 --> 29:32.160
to need medicine and not be able to get it.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.400
What if I go?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.400
I'll get them to bring the Ventolin to the front

29:37.400 --> 29:38.800
and just leave it there, yeah?

29:38.800 --> 29:41.560
If you go and don't come back, this is on your conscience.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.080
Fucking go.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.720
WHEEZING CONTINUES

30:06.680 --> 30:09.960
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

30:13.520 --> 30:15.200
Hey. It's me.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.000
Eyes on. Wait.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.120
Jesse, what are you doing?

30:23.200 --> 30:25.160
Listen, Hani, in fact I'm sure

30:25.160 --> 30:28.240
there's a whole bunch of people listening.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.040
There's a woman here having an asthma attack.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.040
We need some Ventolin.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.440
I want you to bring it to the front door. Only you.

30:34.440 --> 30:38.680
Leave it on the ground and I'll come and get it. But only you.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.120
If you fail to let her do this,

30:41.120 --> 30:44.120
that woman will die and it will be on your conscience,

30:44.120 --> 30:45.640
not mine!

30:53.240 --> 30:55.880
I've got snipers in place.

30:55.880 --> 30:59.120
Make no mistake, if something goes wrong, we will shoot Jesse.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.560
Jesse!

31:03.560 --> 31:06.360
Hani's bringing the Ventolin in now.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.320
- You good? 
- Yep.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.520
This is madness, Jess.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.280
You know they won't meet the demands,

31:55.280 --> 31:57.960
they won't negotiate like this, they never do.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.440
It's just going to end bad.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.680
I know, but I made a plan.

32:01.680 --> 32:06.680
And...even if all that happens is we get your dad back...

32:06.680 --> 32:08.880
It's nuts.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.120
Maybe.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.440
I'm going to step forward and hug him

32:20.440 --> 32:22.600
and then I'm going to walk back.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.040
Hani, step back!

32:30.000 --> 32:32.440
Hold! Hold!

32:38.320 --> 32:40.400
Grab me.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.040
Drag me inside.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.520
There's something that I need you to do for me.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.080
OK?

32:54.080 --> 32:55.200
OK.

32:57.880 --> 33:03.560
HE WHISPERS

33:26.120 --> 33:27.760
Jan, it's me!

33:34.680 --> 33:37.360
- What happened? 
- Natives got restless.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.280
- Um... I've got it. 
- You'll have to do it.

33:51.280 --> 33:55.640
Do it. Go on, shake the inhaler.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.280
Come on.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.800
Put it in her mouth. When she breathes out, push the button.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.880
Susan, you have to sit up a bit. Sit up. The inhaler's here.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.880
OK? Sit up.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.480
When he puffs, breathe in.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.639
- Good. And again. 
- Shh...

34:15.639 --> 34:17.800
- Again. 
- Shh...

34:21.320 --> 34:23.280
That's it.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.600
SHE EXHALES

34:25.600 --> 34:27.239
That's it. Breathe.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.280
No one gets hurt, that's what you said.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.880
Yeah, well, things change.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.760
Breathe easy.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.239
This is not right.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.080
Not right?

34:41.080 --> 34:44.679
There are lots of things that are not right, Jesse.

34:44.679 --> 34:49.639
People getting shot in the street in broad daylight and nothing happens.

34:49.639 --> 34:52.600
They get punched, kicked in the head, rounded up,

34:52.600 --> 34:56.040
tied up like a bunch of animals for expressing an opinion.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.360
"Tied up."

34:58.640 --> 35:01.000
Tied up like this?

35:02.920 --> 35:04.360
Yes.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.080
Exactly like this.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.520
Jan. Jan...

35:12.520 --> 35:14.680
That's 15 minutes. Time's up.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.240
Jan.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.400
There are so many cops out there.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.640
"Maybe it's nuts." She's right.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.200
- Sieges don't work. 
- Tell that to the Romans.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.000
They conquered the fucking world.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.760
The only reason sieges don't work

35:34.760 --> 35:36.920
is because people don't have follow-through.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.520
They make threats and have no follow-through.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.920
But I'm not that person.

35:40.920 --> 35:44.280
Hani's gonna get Ned to check if what Marina said was true.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.120
And if it is, I think we should stop this.

35:52.280 --> 35:56.160
- What's that? 
- Triple-0 switchboard.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.680
No. No. No.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.400
You're going to block emergency calls?

36:00.400 --> 36:03.040
- I don't care. 
- Then you're as bad as they are.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.200
I don't care. I don't care, Jesse, all right?

36:05.200 --> 36:07.000
I've been listening to the same non-violent

36:07.000 --> 36:08.480
bullshit protest songs, all right?

36:08.480 --> 36:11.680
I've listened to them for four years while the bodies pile up.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.440
No more! No fucking more.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.440
Alyse. Please.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.480
You're not the police.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.720
They said someone from the police was coming to get me.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.760
Alyse, please, I'm telling the truth.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.760
We don't have a lot of time. I have to save my brother too.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.400
I just need the files that your mum copied onto her computer

36:43.400 --> 36:44.920
to do that.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.240
DOOR UNLOCKS

36:58.800 --> 37:00.320
Thanks.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.280
All right.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.120
OK.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.720
How's this going to help my mum?

37:20.720 --> 37:22.840
Well, a lot of people are going to have

37:22.840 --> 37:26.000
their true colours shown today...

37:26.000 --> 37:27.600
and your mum's going to be one of them.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.200
Screen shots?

37:43.840 --> 37:45.320
Where do I send them?

37:45.320 --> 37:47.080
Attention, Nolan Daniels, Federal Police.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.040
What are you doing?

37:57.960 --> 37:59.880
I can't prove what she did to my dad,

37:59.880 --> 38:03.880
but she doesn't get to operate in the dark any more.

38:03.880 --> 38:07.480
I'm going to publish the source code of her spyware, her client list,

38:07.480 --> 38:10.120
who she spies on and how much she gets paid to do it.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.400
So lock the door on the way out.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.440
He's hacking the emergency call systems.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.480
We need to bring this to a close.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.400
Patch those calls through.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.080
I want them to hear this too.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.960
'Can you hear me? My baby's not breathing!

38:39.960 --> 38:41.600
'Please!'

38:52.440 --> 38:54.560
MOBILE PHONE BUZZES

39:07.560 --> 39:09.080
OK.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.400
'I think he's dead. He's not moving.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.400
'Hello, is anybody there? Please help me.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.880
'I don't know exactly how many he swallowed.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.000
'Somebody send an ambulance down here right away.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.200
'He's blue. My baby's not breathing. Hello?

39:25.200 --> 39:28.160
'I don't know...'

39:32.960 --> 39:35.040
'I need somebody to send an ambulance.'

39:35.040 --> 39:37.800
PANICKED VOICES

39:40.240 --> 39:43.000
- 'Hello, is anybody there? 
- Somebody call an ambulance...

39:43.000 --> 39:44.680
'Please! Hello?'

39:50.400 --> 39:52.920
Hold, hold, hold.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.600
Go! Go! Make them safe. Make them safe. Go!

39:57.600 --> 39:59.200
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

39:59.200 --> 40:00.760
Make them safe!

40:26.560 --> 40:28.080
Jan?

40:28.080 --> 40:29.440
HE SIGHS

40:49.400 --> 40:50.920
What have you done?

41:14.000 --> 41:15.520
It's not their fault.

41:17.400 --> 41:21.800
We... we... We do it this way, we just play into their hands.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.360
Become everything they already want to believe.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.600
It just hurts Remsey's cause even more.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.680
We have the proof, Jan. Proof of everything they did.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.280
I'm going to walk out of here...

41:37.360 --> 41:39.640
..with my hands in the air...

41:43.680 --> 41:45.360
..cos I want to live.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.040
And I... I want you to come with me.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.160
DISTANT SINGING

42:52.280 --> 42:53.960
- Roth is unarmed. 
- Move forward!

42:53.960 --> 42:56.080
Walk towards us slowly! Keep your hands in the air.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.720
- He's unarmed. 
- Keep coming!

42:58.720 --> 43:01.440
He's unarmed! He's unarmed!

43:01.440 --> 43:04.080
- He's unarmed! 
- Get on the ground, Jesse.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.640
- He's unarmed! 
- Get on the ground.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.240
- He's unarmed! 
- Get down on the ground!

43:07.240 --> 43:09.280
- He's unarmed! 
- Get on the ground!

43:09.280 --> 43:11.160
He's unarmed! He's unarmed!

43:11.160 --> 43:13.880
He's unarmed! He's unarmed!

43:13.880 --> 43:15.280
He's unarmed!

43:16.120 --> 43:17.680
GUNSHOTS

43:17.680 --> 43:19.480
Nooo!

43:22.960 --> 43:24.680
No!

43:24.680 --> 43:26.520
- No! 
- Get him up.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.280
Come on, let's go.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.960
Easy, now. Easy.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.160
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

43:51.160 --> 43:52.440
I think, Ms Jennings,

43:52.440 --> 43:54.400
to get side-tracked by the nature of the leak

43:54.400 --> 43:56.760
is to miss the point entirely.

43:56.760 --> 44:00.040
I'm calling for unequivocal bipartisan support

44:00.040 --> 44:02.000
for an investigation into the matter

44:02.000 --> 44:04.080
and a full royal commission

44:04.080 --> 44:06.960
into the behaviour of Australian companies overseas.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.120
What about the investigation tapes?

44:10.120 --> 44:12.240
But I think the key question to ask

44:12.240 --> 44:15.800
is whether you can arrest people for expressing an opinion

44:15.800 --> 44:18.320
and still call yourself a democracy.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.000
Are you talking about here or in Indonesia?

44:21.000 --> 44:23.080
I'm talking about both.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.720
Hey, what do you think?

44:49.480 --> 44:52.280
Good. For a working title.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.240
Hello.

45:56.600 --> 45:57.760
Hey.

45:59.160 --> 46:01.240
Did you decide yet?

46:02.840 --> 46:04.320
No.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.880
Here we go again.

47:21.880 --> 47:25.840
History never repeats, but it does rhyme.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.240
Pardon?

47:29.160 --> 47:31.240
Mark Twain.

47:31.240 --> 47:36.200
Good-o. Um, let's look at this as probation with benefits.

47:36.200 --> 47:39.560
You get a better wage than most people get in a lifetime.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.440
Um, you get a government-issued car

47:41.440 --> 47:44.760
and access to some of the country's best technical equipment.

47:44.760 --> 47:47.680
All this in return for...

47:49.360 --> 47:52.440
You have the keys to the UndaCounta kingdom.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.840
No one on there yet knows that the witch is dead.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.640
- Warlock. 
- Splitting hairs.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.600
Correcting poorly-constructed metaphors.

48:01.600 --> 48:05.040
OK, so my point is that you have the potential

48:05.040 --> 48:07.720
to assume the role of the warlock

48:07.720 --> 48:10.160
and keep the cash register ringing.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.640
Which would allow you to capture the details

48:12.640 --> 48:16.720
of 957,000 registered account holders.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.120
Yep.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.400
We're only interested in the ones breaking the law.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.120
If you want to live here,

48:29.120 --> 48:31.840
if you want the roads and the schools and the hospitals,

48:31.840 --> 48:33.720
then you get the laws too.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.160
And the prisons...

48:38.520 --> 48:42.280
..which is the genuine alternative to you signing on for this.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.160
There will be conditions.

48:46.160 --> 48:49.360
There'll be a certain level of monitoring of your associations

48:49.360 --> 48:51.400
and your communications.

48:51.400 --> 48:54.520
Ah. And for a while, there'll be a limit on your movements.

48:56.640 --> 48:58.160
Fitted in your car.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.480
Two years inside the box, then the shackles come off.

49:07.480 --> 49:09.840
All will be right with the world.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.160
You sure this is the one you want?

49:21.160 --> 49:22.840
This is the one.

49:24.240 --> 49:26.720
It's going to have to be registered in your name.

49:30.360 --> 49:31.840
OK.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.080
Oh, your, um...

49:38.080 --> 49:39.920
your mum's ashes are ready to be picked up.

49:39.920 --> 49:41.960
I thought you might want to do it together

49:41.960 --> 49:44.280
and, I don't know, get a beer afterwards?

49:47.120 --> 49:48.920
Sounds OK.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.000
OK.

50:31.920 --> 50:33.640
Pull up the leg of your jeans.

50:44.720 --> 50:47.240
I'm assigning it to another lucky bracelet wearer.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.640
Very clever, you are.

50:55.800 --> 50:59.040
There's going to need to be some rules.

50:59.040 --> 51:02.440
You can't just decide stuff without me. Mmm.

51:03.640 --> 51:07.120
We do this, we both share some of the driving.

51:07.120 --> 51:09.200
There's a project I want to work on in Spain.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.040
As soon as we get some money, I want to go there.

51:11.040 --> 51:12.880
Yes. Yes to all that.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.880
SHE LAUGHS

51:38.320 --> 51:40.040
- Hey. 
- Jess.

51:51.560 --> 51:55.000
So a couple of spare... spare sets of clothes

51:55.000 --> 51:56.920
and a prepaid phone.

51:56.920 --> 51:58.840
Oh, and, uh...

52:01.000 --> 52:02.480
Where did you get that?

52:02.480 --> 52:05.360
Um, well, I thought if ever there was a reason

52:05.360 --> 52:09.960
to get over myself and take up Dad's offer, now was it, so...

52:12.160 --> 52:14.520
I'll, um... I'll drive around the city for a while.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.560
Stay in the box. Make sure you stay in the box.

52:19.560 --> 52:21.680
I will stay in the box.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.920
And then I'll park it out the front of Hani's house.

52:23.920 --> 52:26.560
That should give you 12 or 14 hours head start.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.120
You can drive.
