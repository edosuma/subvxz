00:02.240 --> 00:04.559
TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.599 --> 00:05.320
-Not bad.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.280
We killed it.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.199
-I've got a bunch
of dance freaks

00:08.240 --> 00:10.560
that would kill to come to
a taping if you've got room.

00:10.599 --> 00:12.160
-You promised.

00:12.199 --> 00:13.400
-I can't risk these kids with
someone they can't trust.

00:13.439 --> 00:16.039
-You have everything and
you rub it in my face!

00:16.079 --> 00:18.359
-I'm so sick of that
self-righteous attitude.

00:18.399 --> 00:20.280
-Girls.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.039
Enough.

00:21.079 --> 00:24.600
-The thing is, I need you.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.239
-You obviously think I'm stupid.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.640
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
checked to see if I cheated.

00:28.679 --> 00:30.320
-Oh, interesting.

00:30.359 --> 00:33.799
Another thing
you're brilliant at.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.600
-This is Petra Hoffman, on
exchange from the Berlin Ballet

00:36.640 --> 00:37.399
School.

00:37.439 --> 00:38.439
Your new roommate.

00:38.479 --> 00:40.399
Look at Petra's lines.

00:40.439 --> 00:41.039
Lovely.

00:41.079 --> 00:42.240
Lovely training.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.600
-Can you take a
photo of us, Abigail?

00:47.560 --> 00:50.479
[theme music]

01:00.320 --> 01:03.759
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:03.799 --> 01:06.599
Close your eyes.

01:06.640 --> 01:11.359
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.159
This is my chance,
this is my chance,

01:19.200 --> 01:21.640
my chance to feel alive.

01:34.359 --> 01:36.799
TARA (VOICEOVER): Before I left
home, Mom gave me the talk.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.560
Not that talk.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.120
She was worried one day
I'd regret missing out

01:41.159 --> 01:42.599
on being an ordinary teenager.

01:42.640 --> 01:46.480
I told her point blank that
there wasn't any choice.

01:46.519 --> 01:48.239
Because who wants
to be ordinary when

01:48.280 --> 01:51.200
you have the chance of
becoming a professional dancer?

01:54.879 --> 01:56.280
-Taurus.

01:56.319 --> 01:58.439
The dream you desire is
within your reach today.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.319
-So she's staying?

02:00.359 --> 02:02.120
-It's an online
horoscope, people.

02:02.159 --> 02:03.760
Can we get some perspective?

02:03.799 --> 02:05.439
-So you don't want her to stay?

02:05.480 --> 02:06.719
-No, of course I do.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.360
I just, well, I think
that the little horoscope

02:08.400 --> 02:10.719
man inside Kat's phone knows
exactly what Mr. Kennedy is

02:10.758 --> 02:11.400
saying.

02:15.639 --> 02:17.759
Well?

02:17.800 --> 02:21.039
-Mr. Kennedy made it very clear.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.599
He wants me to stay.

02:22.639 --> 02:24.560
-Yes!

02:24.599 --> 02:26.759
-Oh, I'm so excited.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.199
-So, well-- He said that--

02:28.240 --> 02:30.639
-Keep it cool, Lieberman.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.240
You're a walking safety hazard.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.680
-I'm-- I'm running real late.

02:40.719 --> 02:42.159
But that's great news, Petra.

03:13.879 --> 03:14.479
-Careful.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.319
-Yeah.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.479
On the barre [inaudible].

03:24.840 --> 03:30.120
-Um, I-- I could go,
or we could just both--

03:30.159 --> 03:30.599
-It's OK.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.319
-Ready for plies?

03:57.680 --> 03:59.560
Everyone, step out.

03:59.599 --> 04:00.759
I want you all to watch Petra.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.759
See how she maintains her line?

04:16.800 --> 04:18.720
-Ms. Raine's actually smiling.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.600
Can you see the look in her eye?

04:21.639 --> 04:23.800
I think it's love.

04:23.839 --> 04:25.120
Definitely the new favorite.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.199
Don't you think, Abigail?

04:29.480 --> 04:31.639
-Auditions for the junior
summer school program

04:31.680 --> 04:34.800
continue this Saturday
afternoon and Sunday morning.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.399
A roster will be on
the notice board.

04:36.439 --> 04:39.240
If your name appears there, you
have volunteered to help me.

05:01.519 --> 05:02.800
-I'm allowed to be here.

05:02.839 --> 05:04.800
-Lucky you.

05:04.839 --> 05:09.160
Please don't let me stop you.

05:09.199 --> 05:10.639
-Barbecue flavor's better.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.560
-Might want to try chewing.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.560
-Yes, Mom.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.720
-Is she here?

05:27.759 --> 05:29.759
-My sister.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.199
-You know, I liked to do my
own thing when I was your age.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.399
Junior summer program, huh?

05:35.439 --> 05:36.480
-If I get in.

05:36.519 --> 05:37.720
My shoes kind of suck.

05:42.120 --> 05:42.759
-All right.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.600
Come with me.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.600
You'd never believe how
many shoes the girls

05:48.639 --> 05:51.439
here go through in a week.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.480
-Do you mind?

05:53.519 --> 05:57.519
-We were-- I was
just helping Abigail.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.079
-How's he helping?

06:00.120 --> 06:03.680
-Um, I think she was
having trouble breathing.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.399
Right, Sammy?

06:05.439 --> 06:06.079
-Yeah.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.360
-As you were.

06:13.399 --> 06:15.600
[giggle]

06:15.639 --> 06:16.839
-What are you waiting for?

06:16.879 --> 06:19.560
Go stop him before he
tells the whole school.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.399
Stop laughing.

06:20.439 --> 06:21.480
This is a disaster.

06:21.519 --> 06:24.240
-People are going to
find out about us.

06:24.279 --> 06:25.839
-What do you mean, us?

06:25.879 --> 06:27.199
This is just this.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.800
It doesn't make us us.

06:29.839 --> 06:33.040
-OK, so what does this make us?

06:33.079 --> 06:33.519
-Nothing.

06:40.639 --> 06:44.199
-[speaking german]

06:55.839 --> 06:58.160
-How'd Toby take
the news of staying?

06:58.199 --> 07:01.160
-He didn't say it, but
he wants me to come home.

07:01.199 --> 07:02.600
-It must be really
hard for them to think

07:02.639 --> 07:05.600
that you'll be staying
here so much longer.

07:05.639 --> 07:06.560
-Not that.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.839
A company in Berlin.

07:07.879 --> 07:10.079
They want me to start in
the course straight away.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.160
-Wow, that's huge!

07:12.199 --> 07:13.199
-That's child abuse.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.480
You're still a student.

07:14.519 --> 07:15.800
-Uh, I haven't accepted.

07:15.839 --> 07:17.199
-Why not?

07:17.240 --> 07:18.279
You could be a principal
by the time you're 20.

07:18.319 --> 07:19.519
You're easily good enough.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.800
-It's like they heard
I was having some fun,

07:21.839 --> 07:24.399
and they got together
to take it away from me.

07:24.439 --> 07:25.199
-Teen snatchers.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.399
They're the fun police.

07:26.439 --> 07:27.600
-You know what?

07:27.639 --> 07:30.839
Being a teenager for the
first time in my life--

07:30.879 --> 07:33.319
that's my only dream right now.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.480
-I like a girl who's got
her priorities straight.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.199
Girls, I-- I'll
catch up with you.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.199
I just want to
say hi to someone.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.319
-And step to the
right, and curtsy.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.399
And to the left, and curtsy.

07:55.439 --> 07:56.079
Thank you, girls.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.399
Very good work.

07:57.439 --> 07:59.439
Now, when I call your
number, please stay behind

07:59.480 --> 08:00.399
for your callback time.

08:05.399 --> 08:07.240
5.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.240
6.

08:09.279 --> 08:10.240
9.

08:10.279 --> 08:11.680
18.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.160
The rest of you, keep dancing,
and come back next summer.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.040
-Miss Raines, Scout's a natural.

08:22.079 --> 08:23.600
-Scout?

08:23.639 --> 08:24.480
-Number 14.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.680
-Right.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.440
She's flexible, but there
are physical limitations.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.200
-She just hasn't been
trained properly.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.720
-She also has a
very bad attitude.

08:37.759 --> 08:39.440
That is something
that can't be fixed.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.720
As we both know.

08:41.759 --> 08:43.320
Yes, Abigail?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.639
-I'd like to volunteer to help
with the junior auditions.

08:45.679 --> 08:46.799
-You can do the rosters.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.799
Just make sure
you include Petra.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.320
I think the young
girls could learn

08:50.360 --> 08:52.120
a lot from a dancer like her.

08:59.639 --> 09:03.279
-OK, Petra's Sydney summer
experience starts now.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.600
First we need to camp
out for Vibrant tickets.

09:05.639 --> 09:08.320
-No, first, boyfriend.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.559
-All these pictures,
other people kissing.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.600
And none of me.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.240
-We need to remedy that.

09:14.279 --> 09:15.679
-I know who I like.

09:18.679 --> 09:21.240
He's your best friend.

09:21.279 --> 09:23.200
Do yo think there is a chance?

09:23.240 --> 09:24.039
-Sammy?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.480
Really?

09:25.519 --> 09:26.639
-Is he seeing someone?

09:26.679 --> 09:27.399
-No.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.039
-We'd know.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.600
-So it could be me.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.799
-Yeah.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.360
I could totally see
you and Sammy together.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.480
-Aren't we generous?

09:40.519 --> 09:43.720
Looks like we've volunteered
for tomorrow afternoon.

09:43.759 --> 09:45.240
-Is that good of us?

09:45.279 --> 09:46.600
-I haven't volunteered at all.

09:46.639 --> 09:48.600
That's so unlike me.

09:48.639 --> 09:50.480
-Hey, so, we're all
free this afternoon.

09:50.519 --> 09:52.720
Why don't we do something?

09:52.759 --> 09:56.200
-That might be fun, Sammy.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.799
-I've gotta stay here, and
finish this history essay, so--

09:59.840 --> 10:00.799
-Aw, come on.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.399
History's not going to change.

10:02.440 --> 10:07.480
Do it tomorrow, while me
and Petra are volunteering.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.159
-OK.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.639
-I could never get my leg
that high at your age.

10:34.679 --> 10:37.440
Look, Scout, I know I really
screwed up with those tickets,

10:37.480 --> 10:39.639
and I'm sorry.

10:39.679 --> 10:41.120
-It happens.

10:41.159 --> 10:43.120
-You know you're as good
as those other girls that

10:43.159 --> 10:44.159
got a call back.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.360
-Then why didn't I get one?

10:46.399 --> 10:49.159
-Well, you're not a prissy
little Betty Bunhead

10:49.200 --> 10:50.840
strapped into her ballet shoes.

10:50.879 --> 10:54.200
-I know I have
the wrong clothes.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.720
-No, you had a personality.

10:55.759 --> 10:58.320
That's why.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.320
-Anyway, I knew I
wouldn't get in.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.480
I just wanted to see what
it looked like inside.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.120
-Girl [inaudible] have
to look like you're not

11:07.159 --> 11:08.759
even aware your leg's
up next to your ear.

11:08.799 --> 11:09.759
And quiet.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.679
No backing down.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.480
You know what would really help?

11:14.519 --> 11:17.600
Practicing in front of a
mirror, at a proper studio.

11:17.639 --> 11:18.799
-What's the point?

11:18.840 --> 11:21.120
-What if I got you
another audition?

11:23.519 --> 11:24.559
Don't worry.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.519
I won't flake out
on you again, Scout.

11:28.559 --> 11:33.799
[shouting]

11:33.840 --> 11:35.799
-Lauren Lancaster Hall.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.799
Who is that?

11:36.840 --> 11:37.759
-Me!

11:37.799 --> 11:38.600
Hello!

11:38.639 --> 11:39.399
-Lauren, all right.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.399
Number 20.

11:43.679 --> 11:44.639
Abigail?

11:44.679 --> 11:46.480
Have you seen Petra and Tara?

11:46.519 --> 11:47.840
-No, I thought
they were supposed

11:47.879 --> 11:49.480
to be helping you
this afternoon?

11:49.519 --> 11:51.480
-Thought so.

11:51.519 --> 11:53.639
-Well, I was just off to
do some extra practice,

11:53.679 --> 11:54.480
but I could always help.

11:54.519 --> 11:55.279
-Could you?

11:58.120 --> 12:02.480
[shouting]

12:02.519 --> 12:03.559
-All right, girls.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.200
Those of you with a
number, follow me.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.720
The rest of you, line
up with Miss Raine.

12:08.759 --> 12:10.159
OK.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.759
Soft arms now,
floating in the breeze.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.639
PETRA: I'm really
sorry I ever told you.

12:16.679 --> 12:19.480
-I can't believe your ballet
teacher never let you learn.

12:19.519 --> 12:20.360
-Injuries.

12:20.399 --> 12:21.399
Can't risk it.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.799
-Yeah, it's a crime.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.799
-My bike meant freedom.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.720
They stole that from you.

12:26.759 --> 12:29.480
-So, what if I fall?

12:29.519 --> 12:30.679
-Who cares?

12:30.720 --> 12:31.480
How many fouette turns
have you fallen out of?

12:31.519 --> 12:32.159
-Yeah, yeah.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.399
We'll catch you.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.080
Ready?

12:35.120 --> 12:35.679
-Let's do it.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.799
-You got it.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.120
You're riding.

12:44.159 --> 12:44.799
-I'm riding!

12:44.840 --> 12:45.759
-Keep pedaling!

12:49.200 --> 12:50.279
-I can't stop!

12:52.759 --> 12:53.480
-Onto the grass!

13:01.639 --> 13:02.679
-You all right?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.240
-Yeah, I am.

13:04.279 --> 13:07.039
-The sky's never this blue tone.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.360
-But you have snow.

13:08.399 --> 13:11.200
White Christmases and
reindeer, and ice skating.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.440
Everything sparking
and glamorous.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.759
-And freezing cold.

13:15.799 --> 13:17.720
-I'd love to see snow.

13:17.759 --> 13:18.799
-You've never seen snow?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.399
-Hey, you've never
ridden a bike.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.200
-True.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.679
-I've never been on a plane.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.399
It's why I can't wait to join
the company and go on tour.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.600
-I'm the opposite.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.519
I've always wanted to
join the Berlin Ballet

13:28.559 --> 13:30.600
so I can stay close to Toby.

13:30.639 --> 13:31.799
-He's sick, yeah?

13:31.840 --> 13:32.799
-Terrible palsy.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.159
But we don't see him as sick.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.639
He's the coolest person I know.

13:37.679 --> 13:38.799
And my best friend.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.279
That's why I want to stay close.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.039
-Yeah, I want to kill my
little brother most days.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.799
-That, too.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.600
-I think I'm gonna
go take a walk.

13:49.639 --> 13:50.840
-Yeah, I'll come.

13:50.879 --> 13:54.639
-Alone, because Petra's
story really moved me.

13:54.679 --> 13:56.840
So, um, you stay here.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.600
Talk to Petra.

14:00.559 --> 14:03.120
-All that chocolate, I
think I need the exercise.

14:07.799 --> 14:09.759
-See the line your
foot is making?

14:09.799 --> 14:10.559
Watch the mirror.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.200
-I am.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.399
-Come to help, have you?

14:16.440 --> 14:17.320
-What are you doing?

14:20.879 --> 14:21.840
-She's good.

14:21.879 --> 14:23.519
She deserves a second chance.

14:23.559 --> 14:26.120
-And you're the one who's
going to give it to her, right?

14:26.159 --> 14:28.159
-What's your problem?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.759
-I've been the
project before, OK?

14:29.799 --> 14:34.399
I know what it's like for
people to come in and, and help.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.320
What happens to that
kid when you get bored?

14:37.360 --> 14:39.519
-Hey Christian, thanks
for giving me these shoes.

14:39.559 --> 14:42.799
I look like a real
ballerina now, huh?

14:42.840 --> 14:43.639
-You were saying?

14:51.159 --> 14:53.080
-All right, forget all
that pretty tutu stuff.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.200
You're gonna hurt in
there like nothing else.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.159
-Do it slowly.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.159
Work through the pain.

15:04.200 --> 15:04.679
Hold yourself.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.799
Again.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.159
Just like a ballerina.

15:22.159 --> 15:23.600
-OK, what do you
think you're doing?

15:23.639 --> 15:26.480
-What are you doing?

15:26.519 --> 15:26.840
-What?

15:26.879 --> 15:27.639
-Petra.

15:27.679 --> 15:28.600
She likes you.

15:28.639 --> 15:29.600
-Ah.

15:29.639 --> 15:30.639
No, really?

15:30.679 --> 15:31.799
Yeah, you made it
obvious enough.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.080
-So?

15:33.120 --> 15:35.480
-Look, I don't
need your help, OK?

15:35.519 --> 15:36.159
-Good.

15:45.519 --> 15:46.519
-Excuse me.

15:46.559 --> 15:47.879
Open door policy?

15:47.919 --> 15:50.720
I don't want to get in trouble
for breaking the rules.

15:50.759 --> 15:52.440
-Somebody's interested in me.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.559
Nothing's happened yet,
but you should be aware

15:54.600 --> 15:57.480
that I now have options.

15:57.519 --> 15:59.399
-Good for you, Sammy.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.600
-Yeah, so I need to
know what this is.

16:02.639 --> 16:03.559
-This?

16:03.600 --> 16:06.519
-Are we ever going public?

16:06.559 --> 16:10.120
-What, like holding hands
and swapping chewing gum

16:10.159 --> 16:11.639
under the monkey bars public?

16:11.679 --> 16:13.159
-No, that's, that's
not what I mean.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.440
-Or matching public tattoos?

16:15.480 --> 16:17.360
Sammy and Abby forever.

16:17.399 --> 16:19.159
Even better, in
Chinese characters,

16:19.200 --> 16:20.200
so it's more cultural.

16:22.399 --> 16:26.559
-Maybe I should just
go with Petra, then.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.480
-Petra?

16:27.519 --> 16:28.679
-Yeah.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.600
Because at least I know
where I stand with her.

16:32.639 --> 16:35.240
-So what are you waiting for?

16:35.279 --> 16:37.559
-Why won't you admit
that you like me?

16:37.600 --> 16:38.799
OK, am I that embarrassing?

16:38.840 --> 16:40.080
-You are at the moment.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.440
-And where were the two of
you yesterday afternoon?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.200
-But we're on today.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.079
-Then how do you
explain this roster?

17:09.118 --> 17:10.680
I'm especially
disappointed in you, Petra.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.118
I can see it's better
that you remain a student.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.358
You're clearly not ready
for adult responsibility.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.400
-But we--

17:16.440 --> 17:17.839
-Yesterday could
have been a disaster.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.480
I'm just pleased that Abigail
was able to cover for you.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.319
-It's in here somewhere.

17:30.839 --> 17:32.319
-Wow.

17:32.359 --> 17:36.200
She's like, the most beautiful
dancer I've ever seen.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.480
-That's my mom, Natasha.

17:38.519 --> 17:42.480
She is a self-obsessed diva who
only cares about her career.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.559
-I get a card from
my mom sometimes.

17:44.599 --> 17:47.480
Even money, if it's my birthday.

17:47.519 --> 17:48.640
-So, who do you live with?

17:48.680 --> 17:49.640
-My sister.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.119
Well, my half sister, actually.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.720
-Always wanted a sister.

17:54.759 --> 17:56.039
-Hey, what's this?

17:56.079 --> 17:58.640
-Uh, that's an
old concert photo.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.440
-Which one are you?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.839
-That one.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.680
-What a Betty Bunhead.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.559
-Hey.

18:07.599 --> 18:08.319
Ah, here it is.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.480
You sure you wanna be a bunhead?

18:15.799 --> 18:16.400
-Wow.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.759
-OK.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.440
Uh, I'm officially creeped out.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.599
-What are you doing?

18:24.640 --> 18:26.039
-You saw that picture.

18:26.079 --> 18:27.839
All they do is squash
you down until everything

18:27.880 --> 18:30.200
you loved about dance is gone.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.640
-I'm not you, OK?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.319
-OK.

18:35.359 --> 18:36.480
Well, then.

18:36.519 --> 18:38.599
Looks like Operation
Scout is go for launch.

18:52.359 --> 18:54.519
-All right, girls,
let's keep warm.

18:54.559 --> 18:56.039
What about a polka?

18:56.079 --> 18:58.519
Everybody hold
hands and face me.

18:58.559 --> 19:00.160
Right foot, and hop.

19:03.519 --> 19:05.839
-She's in.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.240
-Make a good team.

19:09.279 --> 19:10.599
N--Not that kind of team.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.799
-No.

19:11.839 --> 19:17.039
-Just-- Um, so, my
party and the-- the--

19:17.079 --> 19:17.799
-Uh, yeah.

19:17.839 --> 19:18.799
-We never talked about it.

19:18.839 --> 19:21.200
Uh, mistake, obviously.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.039
-Yes.

19:22.079 --> 19:23.440
Not that it was bad or anything.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.599
-No, not bad at all.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.799
-Just not like that.

19:25.839 --> 19:27.440
-Yeah.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.839
Totally.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.480
Yes, Scout's in.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.160
-Excuse me.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.319
I have to speak to Miss Raine.

19:43.359 --> 19:45.519
There's a problem
with the head count.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.480
-If you tell Miss
Raine about Scout,

19:47.519 --> 19:49.799
I'll tell her you
switched the rosters.

19:49.839 --> 19:51.839
-I have no idea what
you're talking about.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.480
-I know you did it.

19:53.519 --> 19:54.799
I'm just not sure why.

19:54.839 --> 19:56.359
-Can't handle not
being the favorite?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.240
-I'm not here to
be the favorite.

19:58.279 --> 19:59.799
-The way I hear it,
you're here to get

19:59.839 --> 20:01.160
Sammy to be your boyfriend.

20:03.559 --> 20:07.160
-You know why I'm a better
dancer than you, Abigail?

20:07.200 --> 20:08.799
-You're not a better
dancer then me.

20:08.839 --> 20:12.119
-I dance because I love
it, and because I can.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.759
Not to be the best.

20:13.799 --> 20:18.799
-So, you'd rather stay here for
love than dance professionally?

20:18.839 --> 20:23.240
I heard you turn down
the company in Berlin.

20:23.279 --> 20:26.799
-You know what the
really sad thing is?

20:26.839 --> 20:28.400
If you put the same
amount of effort

20:28.440 --> 20:30.279
into ballet that you
put into being mean,

20:30.319 --> 20:32.759
you'd be a much better dancer.

20:32.799 --> 20:36.799
-And five, and six,
and seven, eight.

20:36.839 --> 20:41.559
And bend, and stretch, join
your feet, lower your heels.

20:41.599 --> 20:46.119
And bend, and stretch, join
your feet, lower your heels.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.440
And bend, and stretch, and turn.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.119
Stop.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.480
And you are?

20:59.519 --> 21:00.440
-Number 15.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.200
-Scout.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.319
You're not on my callback list.

21:08.359 --> 21:12.240
Quite a transformation,
I must say.

21:12.279 --> 21:15.319
-Are you going to kick me out?

21:15.359 --> 21:21.400
-Well, perhaps there was
an administrative error.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.319
Now that you're here,
you might as well stay.

21:28.559 --> 21:29.599
All right.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.119
We'll start again,
from the beginning.

21:33.799 --> 21:37.119
Six, and seven, eight.

21:37.160 --> 21:41.480
Bend, and stretch, join
your feet, heels down.

21:41.519 --> 21:43.279
-At least the summer
school will give you

21:43.319 --> 21:46.319
a chance to figure out if
you actually hate it here.

21:46.359 --> 21:47.480
-Like the pain.

21:47.519 --> 21:50.480
Christian said there
was a lot of that.

21:50.519 --> 21:51.640
-Christian said that?

21:51.680 --> 21:52.400
-Uh-hu.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.039
He's the guru.

21:54.079 --> 21:56.079
-Well, we'll be here,
me and Kat and Petra.

21:56.119 --> 21:57.519
We'll help.

21:57.559 --> 21:59.839
-Not me.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.720
I'm going back to Berlin.

22:02.759 --> 22:05.640
I accepted the company's offer.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.359
-What about our summer?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.559
-I want to be near my family.

22:10.599 --> 22:13.359
And it's such a big opportunity.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.799
I might not get a second chance.

22:16.839 --> 22:18.680
TARA (VOICEOVER): At
this exact moment,

22:18.720 --> 22:20.160
my friends back
home were getting

22:20.200 --> 22:22.319
ready for the year 10 formal.

22:22.359 --> 22:24.279
It's all they've talked
about for months.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.480
-I'll miss you.

22:35.519 --> 22:36.680
-Here.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.519
Sydney snow.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.279
-Bye!

22:45.319 --> 22:46.440
-For my recollection.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.039
TARA (VOICEOVER):
Sometimes I dream

22:48.079 --> 22:50.200
I'm back there
living my old life.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.200
And when I wake up,
just for a second,

22:53.240 --> 22:56.319
I wonder if I made
the wrong choice.

22:56.359 --> 22:57.480
-That's how I'll remember you.

22:57.519 --> 23:01.319
TARA (VOICEOVER):
But I don't think so.

23:01.359 --> 23:02.279
-Bye!

23:02.319 --> 23:02.599
-Bye.

23:05.519 --> 23:06.119
-Bye!

23:06.160 --> 23:06.640
-You enjoy that?

23:06.680 --> 23:07.519
-Yeah.

23:07.559 --> 23:09.839
Are we going public now?

23:09.880 --> 23:10.480
-Nope.

23:48.519 --> 23:48.640
