00:01.640 --> 00:05.076
<i>No one wants to live out their last</i>
<i>years in a hospital, but people do.</i>

00:05.160 --> 00:08.709
<i>There's not much we can do for them</i>
<i>except try to protect their dignity,</i>

00:08.800 --> 00:10.711
<i>and, of course, bet on them.</i>

00:10.800 --> 00:13.712
- Come on, Mr Gilmore.
- Come on, Colonel Mustard!

00:14.440 --> 00:16.795
Ha! Pay up.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.677
Can I get some Jell-O, please?

00:18.760 --> 00:19.988
Jell-O is for winners.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.672
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.591
We'll have some sent to your room.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.954
Thank you.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.396
You'll not believe the trouble
I'm having finding a place to live.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.357
What happened
with that guest house?

00:30.440 --> 00:32.237
It's fully furnished,

00:32.320 --> 00:34.788
and the owner
of the main house is just great.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.952
In fact, if you look out the window,
you can see him right now.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.508
Oh, he's perfect.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.079
Perfect for what?

00:42.160 --> 00:44.390
Yeah, I think I'm gonna keep looking.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.676
Things were going better for Elliot.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.518
- Thanks for the movie.
- You're welcome for the movie.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.716
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>Jake was able to handle</i>

00:53.800 --> 00:57.031
<i>the piping-hot giant bowl</i>
<i>of crazy that is Elliot Reid.</i>

01:01.960 --> 01:05.111
Oh, God! I locked the door
when a black guy walked by.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.112
He'll think I think
he's dangerous cos he's black.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.079
Not just black, but with an actual 'fro,
which I don't find scary at all.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.628
Not like the zig-zags
and the cornrows and stuff.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.472
- My night's ruined.
- No it isn't.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.595
Hey, did you think she was locking
the door cos you're black?

01:24.680 --> 01:26.557
I thought she was locking the door.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.596
Thanks, man. Better?

01:28.680 --> 01:31.148
Coolio. Let's go get some ice cream.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.755
<i>Unfortunately for Jake, he still had</i>
<i>to pass muster with Turk and me,</i>

01:34.840 --> 01:37.593
<i>and nothing is quite</i>
<i>as daunting as our good guy test.</i>

01:37.680 --> 01:39.113
Well, I could use a beer.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.394
I got this round.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.913
Be right back.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.479
- Good guy.
- Great guy.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.357
- Oh, my God.
- Excellent choice.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.032
And finished.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.272
I remember the bordello being bigger.
There were probably more prostitutes.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.999
But maybe I just remember it
that way cos I was a kid.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.638
It was my 12th birthday.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.952
I asked for a bike.
I got a 48-year-old whore.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.712
It's beautiful.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.439
It's almost a shame I get
these casts off in a week.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.590
- A month.
- A what?

02:08.680 --> 02:10.910
I worked too hard.
Take 'em off in a month.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.513
I'll call my orthopaedist.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.352
Dr Murphy, I'd have more sympathy

02:14.440 --> 02:17.989
if this were the first time you'd broke
your feet working in the morgue.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.957
It's like corpses are out to get me.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.359
If only.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.954
Anyway, I need you
to give up this thing.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.271
No offence, son, but I can't have
a delusional bozo like you

02:27.360 --> 02:30.318
driving a motorised vehicle
around this hospital.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.110
Well, if it isn't
the Sullivan Street Cathouse!

02:37.600 --> 02:39.397
What are you doing?

02:39.480 --> 02:43.268
Dr Kelso told me to stand here
at exactly 12.05 with my lunch,

02:43.360 --> 02:44.952
but I don't know why.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.439
Thanks, Ted!

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:00.560 --> 03:02.312
Everybody, gather around here.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.470
Circle it up.
Bring it in nice and tight.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.916
I know I'm pretty quick to point out
other people's mistakes,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.231
but I have a son now,
and I also realise that it's important

03:11.320 --> 03:13.880
to recognise when someone
does something right.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.238
Mr Blake, down in bed three,
came in here with what seemed like

03:18.320 --> 03:21.437
a basic heart block,
but someone took the time

03:21.520 --> 03:23.909
to find out that recently
he'd been camping,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.276
and correctly diagnosed him
with Lyme carditis.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.033
Some of you are gonna think
this is a silly exercise,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.190
but I'd like that someone
to step forward

03:32.280 --> 03:34.669
and stick your hand up in the air

03:34.760 --> 03:38.150
so that the group can recognise
your great good work.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.869
This is no time to be modest.
Come now.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.473
Oh, my God, it was me!

03:50.560 --> 03:52.232
I did it. I'm a genius.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.595
I'm a huge brain in a ripped-up body.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.156
I am Jesus H. Cox., M.D.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.800
Still, I probably couldn't
have done it by myself.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.156
I'd like to recognise some
of the other players involved.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.789
There was the intern who originally
misdiagnosed the patient.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.518
- That's me.
- Put your hand down.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.434
Then there was the resident
who confirmed that misdiagnosis.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.478
I was up late watching
a <i>Designing Women</i> marathon.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.949
And last but not least,
there was the surgeon

04:19.040 --> 04:23.238
who wanted to crack open
Mr Blake's chest like a walnut

04:23.320 --> 04:25.754
and put in a pacemaker
that he didn't even need.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.118
He's too modest to introduce himself
to the group, so I'll do the honours.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.509
He is so black,

04:32.600 --> 04:35.990
so bald, and he can't eat cupcakes
because he's got diabetes.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.116
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Turk.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.919
Can you just get out of here
so we can get back to work?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.195
Not until people start chanting my name,

04:43.280 --> 04:46.636
so that I can exit the room with
my hands held high above my head

04:46.720 --> 04:48.517
in a victorious gesture.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.832
See, this diagnosing machine,
this fabulous thing,

04:52.920 --> 04:56.390
well, it runs on props, so I'm going
to need to hear it. Come now.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.833
Cox.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.911
Cox. Cox.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.560
Me. Me. Me.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.232
Oh, so me!

05:05.360 --> 05:07.510
I've never connected
with a guy like this.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.876
It's only been two weeks. I know
Jake better than I know myself.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.474
- What does he do for a living?
- I should know that.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.312
What's the sex like?

05:15.400 --> 05:17.994
What makes you think
that I have slept with him?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.310
You've known him more than ten minutes.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.512
You are a weird and angry man!

05:25.480 --> 05:26.549
Two bits.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.915
I've been thinking
about my relationships.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.231
Every time one has potential,
I go too fast and ruin everything.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.912
Jake's not gettin' any.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.039
You're half a glass of wine away from
nuding up and doing your go-to move.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.111
- Which is?
- Her on top, eyes closed

05:40.200 --> 05:42.156
yelling, "Don't look at me!"

05:42.240 --> 05:44.959
- Sex is disgusting.
- I know, sweetie.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.076
Look...

05:47.160 --> 05:49.913
I am attracted to Jake,
but I'm an adult.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.638
I can control my urges.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.317
No means no.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.958
Gotta go.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.800
- 'Night, Elliot.
- Good night, Jake.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.988
I'll check back with you after
I look in on a few other patients.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.589
Mr Evans!

06:25.600 --> 06:27.670
What the hell?

06:34.920 --> 06:36.069
Four, please.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.678
Try not to breathe on the chrome, Lurch.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.318
Out of my way, minions.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.556
You might want to pick up a pamphlet
on that new thing called chewing.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.595
Hey, can I get...

06:55.680 --> 06:56.874
One second.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.428
Cox! Cox! Cox!

07:00.440 --> 07:02.032
I eat here all the time.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.633
Oh, yeah.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.751
Guy's choking!

07:06.840 --> 07:08.671
I can't clear his airway.
Call 911!

07:08.760 --> 07:11.672
He'll be brain dead by...
I'm gonna do an emergency trach.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.239
Let me get a knife!

07:13.320 --> 07:14.719
A clean knife!

07:15.520 --> 07:17.556
And can I get a number two,
no sour cream?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.673
Hey, now, great work back there, Gandhi.

07:24.760 --> 07:28.753
What a story, huh? Blood, bravery,
illegal immigrants... It had it all.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.071
When you tell Carla about this,
the next time you two have sex,

07:32.160 --> 07:36.073
there's a slight chance that she
actually just might think about you.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.071
Perry, Perry, Perry.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.355
You know what the difference
between us is?

07:40.440 --> 07:42.908
Besides the fact
that I can carry a conversation

07:43.000 --> 07:45.992
without checking my own reflection
every five seconds?

07:46.080 --> 07:47.798
I'm sorry. I get lost in my eyes.

07:47.880 --> 07:51.953
Anyway, I'm not gonna tell anyone
about this because unlike you...

07:56.960 --> 07:59.554
...unlike you, I got into medicine
to help people,

07:59.640 --> 08:01.596
not for my own personal glory.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.671
Yeah. Now that's just a load of crap.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.877
The only reason anybody
ever does anything is to feed the ego,

08:06.960 --> 08:09.428
because that's what we are,
ego monsters.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.717
Mark my words, eventually
you will tell people what you did.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.075
- Oh, we'll see.
- Yeah, we'll see.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.390
- Yeah. We will see.
- We will so see!

08:17.480 --> 08:19.357
- Want to call it?
- That's a good idea.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.076
See you later.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.515
I don't know how to avoid
sleeping with Jake.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.512
It's easy. If you find yourself
in a romantic situation,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.352
do something that's a turn-off.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.556
Like how you can
swallow your whole fist.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.636
No way! She can't do that!

08:34.720 --> 08:37.313
Calm down, boys. Let me just ask.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.710
Can you really swallow your whole fist?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.472
Yeah.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.469
Don't ruin it.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.913
Men are twisted.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.797
Do you guys have any other ideas?

08:49.880 --> 08:52.872
I don't have time to be dealing
with your little sex pickle.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.997
Really? She spent two years
dealing with yours.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.832
I hate that thing.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.475
Sir, you probably haven't noticed this,

09:02.560 --> 09:06.792
but the floors around here are so clean
you can see yourself in them.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.277
Why you handsome son of a gun!

09:10.680 --> 09:12.671
Have you looked at me lately, fellas?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.512
Oh, <i>bellissimo!</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:18.592
I know we haven't taken care
of that asbestos thing,

09:18.680 --> 09:20.750
and I know some toilets flush upward...

09:20.840 --> 09:23.434
Get to the point.
My battery power is running low.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.671
The one thing that I'm proud of
is that these floors are so clean

09:26.760 --> 09:28.239
you could eat off of 'em.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.958
Why is that?

09:32.160 --> 09:34.276
If you're going to throw food
on the floor,

09:34.360 --> 09:36.920
you can just eat there from now on.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.676
Soup night was the worst.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.672
All-righty. Point proving time.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.469
Carla, I assume tubby hubby here told
you what happened at the taco stand.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.233
Tell me you didn't
try to get free guacamole again

09:49.320 --> 09:52.278
by telling them you were married
to one of their people.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.952
No, I did not!

09:54.800 --> 09:58.475
I don't have the need to make everything
about me. I'm not that pathetic.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.755
So, what did happen at the taco stand?

10:02.240 --> 10:05.277
<i>There are people in life</i>
<i>who know how to push your buttons...</i>

10:05.360 --> 10:07.999
The guy started choking,
so I sprung into action

10:08.080 --> 10:10.196
and gave him an emergency trach.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.872
Yeah.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.190
<i>It's important to have a plan</i>
<i>to deal with it,</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:16.840
<i>even if it means never</i>
<i>being alone with someone.</i>

10:16.920 --> 10:19.229
Wow, <i>Body Heat's</i> a sexy movie, huh?

10:19.320 --> 10:22.471
Doesn't Kathleen Turner
have dynamite nerps?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.039
Yeah.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.430
<i>Of course, if that person is stubborn,</i>
<i>there's not much you can do.</i>

10:27.520 --> 10:29.158
I'm sorry. I'd love to help you,

10:29.240 --> 10:32.038
but I could give a horse's patootie
about your floors.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.792
My floors are my children!

10:35.280 --> 10:37.510
I've given them names!

10:37.600 --> 10:40.672
<i>The key is to figure out a way</i>
<i>to not let them get the best of you.</i>

10:40.760 --> 10:43.513
Honestly, it was like death and I
had a staring match

10:43.600 --> 10:46.751
and, well, death blinked.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.150
All of you know
I'm not one to toot my own horn, but...

10:51.480 --> 10:52.515
...beep, beep.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.036
OK, that's it! That's it!
I can't take this anymore! That's it!

10:56.120 --> 10:59.476
I saved the guy, people.
Death blinked at me!

10:59.560 --> 11:01.357
You got that? He blinked at me!

11:01.440 --> 11:04.876
- OK?!
- Yeah!

11:04.960 --> 11:08.509
Oh, doesn't that feel so much better?

11:08.600 --> 11:12.195
I am so proud of you.
Well struck.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.714
So well struck.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.358
Yes.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.594
It's just the way I called it.
Grandpa Goatee to win,

11:24.680 --> 11:28.878
Pee Pants to place
and Wrong-Way Wally not to finish.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.394
- He does have glaucoma.
- I should've been told!

11:31.480 --> 11:35.029
It wouldn't have mattered. You know why?
Because I am always right.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.271
It's something my pal Gandhi
knows a little something about

11:38.360 --> 11:41.352
because, you see,
we are both egotistical peas

11:41.440 --> 11:43.590
in a giant narcissistic pod.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.033
And to prove my point,

11:45.120 --> 11:48.556
I am going to go ahead
and make an unnecessarily showy,

11:48.640 --> 11:51.598
but undeniably impressive, exit.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.432
Rope time, Gandhi.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.717
Feel it. I'll see you later.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.076
I would so mock him right now

12:02.160 --> 12:04.958
if I wasn't so turned on.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.359
I'm not like that, am I?

12:07.440 --> 12:10.398
Actually, Turk,
you are slightly Cox-ish.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.516
Yeah. The way you do that victory dance

12:12.600 --> 12:14.795
every time you win
the slightest argument.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.235
- No, I don't.
- Maybe not.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.756
You know, Turk, you were right.
Next year is not a leap year.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.038
Damn it!

12:30.200 --> 12:32.031
Thanks for giving me a ride to work.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.315
I hope you didn't mind
J.D. Tagging along.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.439
- Next time he'll let you sit up front.
- Maybe she'll yell "shotgun" faster.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.909
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.037
Elliot, you can't keep
taking J.D. Everywhere you go.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.997
You're gonna have to trust yourself.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.958
No, I won't, Carla.
The system is working. Trust me.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.430
I will not be having sex with Jake
anytime soon.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.671
That seems like a strange thing
to announce to your friends.

12:56.720 --> 13:00.076
- I just came back to get my keys.
- <i>This is so awkward.</i>

13:00.160 --> 13:01.991
<i>Look away. Look away!</i>

13:02.720 --> 13:07.271
- All your references checked out.
- I never gave you any references.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.270
Where the hell's my Rascal?

13:14.440 --> 13:16.396
How do you like my new floor waxer?

13:16.480 --> 13:19.950
That's not yours! That's my car thing.
You just painted it!

13:20.040 --> 13:22.759
- I did not.
- You've got green paint on your face.

13:22.840 --> 13:27.356
I do... Well, that's not paint.
That's pudding.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.318
Even if this was the Rascal,
you can't prove anything.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.790
And it's no good to hide it from me
cos I got keys to everything.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.031
Except the third floor mental ward.
Someone stole that one.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.879
- Was he smoking a gavel?
- Seemed to be.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.997
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do. Floors to wax!

13:46.080 --> 13:48.196
Floors to wax!

13:55.800 --> 13:58.360
Why do I have to have
my gallbladder taken out?

13:58.440 --> 14:01.318
Because, Mr Hoffner,
you have gallstones.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.231
Why do I have gallstones?

14:03.320 --> 14:06.790
Did you possibly eat a gall-boulder
and then fall on your stomach?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.472
Do I need my gallbladder?

14:08.560 --> 14:11.154
Oh, my God.
It is a completely useless organ.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.071
Wait, that's not completely true.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.232
It turns out we could remove it
and then jam it in your mouth

14:16.320 --> 14:19.710
to keep you from asking the question
we've been over for three days.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.394
Come on. We're both in a position
to get good news.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.234
You'll feel better, I'm gonna get the
most annoying patient out of my hair.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.151
Plus, you're in a bonus situation.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.676
I hand-picked the surgeon
that you're going to be torturing.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.274
- Here he is now.
- Is this the gallbladder guy?

14:34.360 --> 14:35.998
Do I need my gallbladder?

14:37.360 --> 14:38.634
Enjoy.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.716
- I'm giving up on men.
- Just call him.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.711
- You can't make me.
- Unfortunately,

14:44.800 --> 14:48.839
I know that the guy you're dating
is always under speed dial number one.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.148
<i>Constipation Hotline.</i>

14:50.240 --> 14:52.356
Two is your current boyfriend.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.510
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Frick.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.158
Listen, Jake...

14:58.040 --> 15:00.554
It's not that I'm never
going to have sex with you.

15:00.640 --> 15:04.315
I'm going to, and believe me, when I
am on top, eyes closed and screaming,

15:04.400 --> 15:06.470
you're gonna be happy you waited.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.199
I'm gonna go ahead
and take you off speaker phone.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.072
<i>Hi.</i>

15:13.360 --> 15:17.148
- So, are you a good surgeon?
- I'm capable.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.471
Capable.
I'm not sure I want the surgery.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.950
Gandhi... a word.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.439
Look, I know what you're doing in there.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.511
You think if you act like Dr Sad Sack,

15:30.600 --> 15:34.752
the patient's gonna opt out of surgery,
and I'll have to spend yet another week

15:34.840 --> 15:37.673
with a man who has such
an attachment to his gallbladder

15:37.760 --> 15:41.116
that, left to his devices, he would
rent a room and have sex with it.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.270
Now, come on.
I need you to sling that

15:43.360 --> 15:46.432
"I'm gonna get freaky-deeky
with my... chisel...

15:46.520 --> 15:51.036
and swizzle up the dizzle
for my... bee-ai-itch..."

15:51.120 --> 15:54.590
...stuff that you know you do so well.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.592
Sorry, I'm not that guy anymore.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.629
Are you sure
I don't need my gallbladder?

16:01.720 --> 16:04.473
Oh... dear... Lord.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.075
The reason I've been acting so weird
and having my friends around

16:09.160 --> 16:11.958
is because I think
we have a shot for something great.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.838
I didn't want to ruin it
by sleeping with you too fast.

16:14.920 --> 16:18.799
- What was I supposed to do?
- You could have just told me that.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.110
Yes, but you're forgetting I'm crazy.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.998
Elliot, please.
Look, everybody has their stuff.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.436
Like me. I'm emotional.
I've always had trouble expressing it.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.557
Here, tell me you like my shirt.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.632
- I like your shirt.
- Cool.

16:33.720 --> 16:37.872
OK, now tell me my childhood dog,
Buster, was never put down,

16:37.960 --> 16:41.509
and we're gonna be reunited
this weekend. You can paraphrase.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.798
- Buster's coming home.
- Cool.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.472
There's no difference,
and Buster meant the world to me.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.835
I really like you,
Elliot, but I'm an adult.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.195
I want this to be an adult relationship.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.398
If you want to be patient and not
have sex right away, then that's fine,

16:59.480 --> 17:02.438
because I think we have a chance
for something great too.

17:04.040 --> 17:08.157
- I want you so bad right now.
- Cool.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.875
Guess I should get goin'.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.512
You paged in the middle of a busy day.
Better be important.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.034
- What were you doing?
- Sleeping in a mop closet.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.951
You forced me to do this.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.634
Either we figure out a way
to share the Rascal,

17:31.720 --> 17:34.712
or neither one of us gets it.
It's your move.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.678
You've got eight seconds
before this becomes rubble.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.632
Five seconds.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.518
Come on. This is gonna hurt you
more than it hurts me.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.477
I doubt it.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.039
You moved my car there, didn't you?

17:57.120 --> 18:00.396
Like I said... a key to everything.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.754
I know it sounds corny,

18:08.840 --> 18:11.559
but we made a big difference
in that person's life.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.633
I hope she digs her new cans.
You did great work.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.518
You know, it's not about me.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.114
- Assisted five. I'll take it.
- Walk with me.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.431
I cannot believe that you
are the one I have to tell this.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.196
Ego is good, ya dumbass. The reason
that guy wants you to be his surgeon,

18:29.280 --> 18:31.919
the reason that she
is borderline attracted to you

18:32.000 --> 18:34.195
and she so desperately
wants to marry you.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.352
Page me when you're headed home.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.079
Bottom line, in medicine,
half of pulling it off

18:40.160 --> 18:44.119
is believing you're the biggest, badass
of a doctor to ever walk these halls.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.510
Want to see how you end up
if you don't believe that?

18:49.560 --> 18:52.552
I don't know how it happened again,
but it did.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.110
<i>As I gangsta-leaned down the hallway</i>

18:56.200 --> 18:58.555
<i>in the rad new wheels</i>
<i>I found by the Dumpster,</i>

18:58.640 --> 19:01.916
<i>I couldn't help but think</i>
<i>how ego affects everything.</i>

19:07.920 --> 19:09.433
<i>Without a healthy dose of it,</i>

19:09.520 --> 19:12.034
<i>you can't trust yourself</i>
<i>to do what you want.</i>

19:12.120 --> 19:14.315
I don't think that
we're going too quick.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.913
By the way, what do you do?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.992
I make and distribute
Hungarian pornography.

19:20.720 --> 19:24.474
- I'm a real estate developer.
- Thank God.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.833
<i>Of course, with too much ego,</i>

19:28.920 --> 19:32.515
<i>you can end up losing something</i>
<i>you wish you still had.</i>

19:36.240 --> 19:37.673
You OK?

19:37.760 --> 19:41.958
I'm not used to walking from my office
to the nurses station.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.517
<i>But with the right amount,</i>
<i>nothing can get in your way.</i>

19:48.600 --> 19:51.592
I am going to yank that gallbladder
out of you so fast,

19:51.680 --> 19:54.558
your spleen is gonna say,
"What happened to Frank?"

19:54.640 --> 19:57.950
That's right, your kidney
named your gallbladder Frank.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.952
I don't want you to worry about
this another second, OK?

20:01.040 --> 20:03.349
Cos I'm the man! I am the man.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.878
Look at you! High-five.
