that letter right now.

14:46.066 --> 14:47.333

- The letter.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.200
- What letter?
- The letter I wrote about you.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.600
He's--
- What are you talking about?

14:50.600 --> 14:51.700
- I wrote a letter--

14:51.734 --> 14:53.166
Kenny was going
to read it out loud

14:53.200 --> 14:55.333
and dedicate
"Celebrate Me Home" to you.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.200
- Maggie!
What was in the letter?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.300
- Just...

15:00.333 --> 15:01.467
Well, I don't know
if you know this,

15:01.500 --> 15:03.300
but today is
the anniversary of the day

15:03.333 --> 15:05.734
that you came back to Pinebrook
and gave up everything

15:05.734 --> 15:07.600
to help me when
I really needed it,

15:07.600 --> 15:09.467

- Has it really been a year?

15:09.467 --> 15:11.066

thank you, and...

We're not up there!

we're not even going to hear it.

- I care!

15:23.233 --> 15:25.333

15:26.667 --> 15:29.100
You write
the best letters.

after all.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.767

"Suck on this."

should we head home?

Bosephus hat once and for all?

No, we're not.

- Give me that hat.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.767
