WEBVTT

00:02.583 --> 00:05.417
OK, PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME
SOMETHING. ANYTHING.

00:05.417 --> 00:08.166
A SMALL JUICY
LITTLE MORSEL
JUST TO TIDE ME OVER

00:08.166 --> 00:10.000
SO I CAN KEEP ON LIVING
VICARIOUSLY THROUGH YOU.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.041
FIRST OF ALL,
WHEN DISCUSSING
MY LOVE LIFE,

00:12.041 --> 00:14.000
TRY NOT TO USE THE WORD
JUICY OR MORSEL.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.041
OK? IT CHEAPENS ME.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.166
FINE. FINE.

00:17.166 --> 00:20.458
BUT YOU AND TOBEY
ARE GOING OUT AGAIN, RIGHT?

00:20.458 --> 00:22.166
YES, WE ARE
GOING OUT AGAIN.

00:22.166 --> 00:23.834
AND?

00:23.834 --> 00:24.834
AND THAT'S
ALL YOU'RE GETTING.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.000
MIGHT I REMIND YOU
THAT IT WAS ME

00:26.000 --> 00:27.125
THAT GOT THE 2
OF YOU TOGETHER?

00:27.125 --> 00:28.083
MM-HMM.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.291
DON'T MAKE ME BEG.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.875
BECAUSE I'LL DO IT
AND IT WON'T BE PRETTY.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.291
ACTUALLY, BEGGING HAPPENS
TO BE A GREAT LOOK FOR YOU.

00:34.291 --> 00:35.667
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
STICK OUT THAT POUTY
LOWER LIP.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.875
IT'S VERY SEXY.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.667
WELL, I MUST BE
OFF MY GAME, DRUE.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.542
NORMALLY I CAN SMELL YOU
COMING A MILE AWAY.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.875
BE NICE OR YOU WON'T GET
YOUR YEARBOOKS.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.792
OOH!
NICE.

00:44.792 --> 00:46.250
THAT IS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY
NICE OF YOU.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.542
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:47.542 --> 00:49.542
HEY, HOW MANY PROM DROWNINGS
DO I HAVE TO RESCUE YOU FROM

00:49.542 --> 00:50.125
BEFORE YOU ACCEPT
THE NEW ME?

00:50.125 --> 00:51.500
MAYBE ONE...OR TWO.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.500
HMM. IF WE CAN ALL TURN
TO PAGE 53 IN OUR PRAYER
BOOKS,

00:55.500 --> 01:00.500
I THINK WE SHOULD BOW
OUR HEADS IN A MOMENT
OF SILENCE.

01:01.792 --> 01:03.041
I WONDER IF THEY'VE SEEN
THIS YET?

01:03.041 --> 01:04.041
OR IF
THEY'RE TALKING YET?

01:04.041 --> 01:05.542
I WONDER IF ANYONE
BESIDES YOU 2 CARES?

01:05.542 --> 01:06.750
WELL, AS FAR AS I KNOW,
THEY HAVEN'T SAID
SO MUCH AS A HELLO

01:06.750 --> 01:08.750
SINCE THE PROM DEBACLE.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.375
SAME GOES
FOR DAWSON AND GRETCHEN.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.625
SEE, THAT CONFUSES ME.
I MEAN, I WAS SURE

01:11.625 --> 01:12.500
THAT THEY WOULD'VE
GOTTEN BACK TOGETHER BY NOW.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.291
THEY'RE SO GOOD
FOR EACH OTHER.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.667
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
CAN BE TOUGH.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.291
HE'S GONNA BE IN L.A.

01:17.291 --> 01:18.834
YOU KNOW, THE WAY I SEE IT,
IF ANYBODY'S GETTING
BACK TOGETHER,

01:18.834 --> 01:20.041
JOEY AND PACEY.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.500
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
ALL YOU GUYS DO IS TALK.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.166
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SAY IT'S TIME
WE TAKE SOME ACTION.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.375
[CHUCKLES]

01:27.375 --> 01:28.458
WHO WILL LIVE TO SUCK FACE
ANOTHER DAY?

01:28.458 --> 01:31.875
WILL IT BE JOEY AND PACEY?
GRETCHEN AND DAWSON?

01:31.875 --> 01:32.375
BOTH...OR NEITHER?

01:33.750 --> 01:36.041
IT'S DISGUSTING.

01:36.041 --> 01:38.250
YEAH, IT'S REALLY
INAPPROPRIATE, DRUE.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.125
JEN,
SPOT ME 2 BUCKS.

01:41.125 --> 01:43.708
I CAN DO THAT.
I GOT IT HERE.

01:43.708 --> 01:44.333
I HAVE A 20.
TAKE IT ALL THE WAY, BABY.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.125
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

01:46.125 --> 01:47.417
WHOA!

01:47.417 --> 01:49.000
DAWSON, JOEY.
YOU GUYS EATEN?

01:49.000 --> 01:49.500
CUTE, HUH?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.583
AW.

03:01.875 --> 03:04.125
[KNOCK KNOCK]

03:04.125 --> 03:05.500
BUSY?

03:05.500 --> 03:08.000
OH, YEAH. I'M JUST DOING
SOME LAST LOOKS
ON THIS BROOKS FILM

03:08.000 --> 03:10.166
BEFORE I SEND IT OFF
TO USC.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.250
IF I GOT ANY CHANCE
AT ALL OF GETTING IN
THEIR SUMMER PROGRAM

03:12.250 --> 03:14.375
THIS HAS TO BE OUT
BY TOMORROW.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.750
HONEY, HAVE YOU TALKED
TO GRETCHEN YET?

03:17.750 --> 03:19.375
[SIGH] THERE'S NOT
REALLY MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.041
BUT ARE YOU OK WITH THE WAY
THINGS WERE LEFT

03:21.041 --> 03:23.166
BETWEEN THE 2 OF YOU?

03:23.166 --> 03:26.125
WELL,
I'M NOT DOING CARTWHEELS.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.708
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.375
I'M SURE WE'LL
EVENTUALLY FIND A WAY

03:30.375 --> 03:33.542
TO RESTORE
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.708
WELL, I DON'T SEE
HOW YOU'RE GONNA
RESTORE YOUR FRIENDSHIP

03:35.708 --> 03:37.000
IF YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.500
WELL, IT'S MY FRIENDSHIP
SO I'LL HANDLE IT.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.834
GRETCHEN'S LEAVING TOWN.

03:50.208 --> 03:51.375
WHEN?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

03:51.375 --> 03:53.667
SHE GAVE HER NOTICE
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.792
TODAY'S HER LAST DAY
AT THE RESTAURANT.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.375
SO IT MUST BE
SOON THEN.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.166
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT TO KNOW

04:00.166 --> 04:01.500
IF YOU WANT
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.375
WELL, SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE WAS LEAVING.

04:04.375 --> 04:07.041
SO OBVIOUSLY SHE
DOESN'T WANT ME TO KNOW.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.375
NO. NO, THE TRUTH IS,
DAWSON,

04:08.375 --> 04:10.291
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
GRETCHEN'S THINKING
RIGHT NOW.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.417
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO
OVER THERE AND FIND OUT?

04:12.417 --> 04:17.791
YOU COULD, UH...ASK HER
TO SIGN YOUR YEARBOOK,

04:17.791 --> 04:20.375
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD WAY
TO START A CONVERSATION.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.583
MOM,
I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT,

04:24.583 --> 04:27.625
BUT ASIDE
FROM THAT BEING
A PAINFULLY LAME IDEA,

04:27.625 --> 04:29.875
THAT'S SUCH A THINLY
VEILED ATTEMPT
AT A RECONCILIATION

04:29.875 --> 04:31.166
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
THERE'S A VEIL THERE.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.417
WELL, THEN I'M SURE
YOU'LL THINK
OF SOMETHING BETTER.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.834
BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
GRETCHEN IN YOUR LIFE, HONEY,

04:35.834 --> 04:37.208
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TALK TO HER,

04:37.208 --> 04:39.542
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO IT SOON.

04:57.792 --> 05:01.333
HEY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

05:01.333 --> 05:03.625
THIS BABY SHOULD RUN
FOR ANOTHER
2,000-3,000 MILES, EASY.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.500
THOUGH IT WOULDN'T KILL YOU
TO CHANGE THE OIL

05:06.500 --> 05:07.750
EVERY ONCE IN A MILLENNIUM.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.959
I'LL TRY
AND REMEMBER THAT.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.291
OH, I TALKED
TO THE LANDLORD,

05:11.291 --> 05:14.458
AND WE'RE OFFICIALLY
PAID UP TILL THE END
OF NEXT MONTH.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.000
AND AFTER THAT
THE LEASE IS UP.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.291
THANKS FOR DOING THAT.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.208
NO PROBLEM.
CONSIDER IT PAYMENT

05:20.208 --> 05:21.375
FOR THE WORK
YOU'VE DONE ON MY CAR.

05:23.041 --> 05:25.959
YOU WANT THIS?

05:25.959 --> 05:29.208
THANKS. [SIGH]

05:30.250 --> 05:31.417
SO HOW ARE YOU?

05:31.417 --> 05:34.667
UH...TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'VE HAD BETTER DAYS.

05:34.667 --> 05:39.375
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF?
YOU TALKED TO DAWSON LATELY?

05:39.375 --> 05:40.834
NO.

05:40.834 --> 05:43.458
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M AVOIDING HIM
OR HE'S AVOIDING ME.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.834
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.041
JOEY?

05:47.041 --> 05:48.291
SAME THING.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.542
I'M REALLY SORRY, PACE.

05:51.542 --> 05:55.333
DO YOU THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE THAT YOU AND I

05:55.333 --> 05:56.667
MIGHT ACTUALLY
FEEL BETTER

05:56.667 --> 05:58.250
IF WE WERE TO
DEAL WITH OUR
SIGNIFICANT EXs

05:58.250 --> 05:59.417
INSTEAD OF
JUST HOLING UP

05:59.417 --> 05:59.834
IN THIS COZY LITTLE
BEACH HOUSE?

05:59.834 --> 06:01.708
PROBABLY.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.834
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M ACTUALLY READY

06:03.834 --> 06:04.333
TO GO OUT THERE AND COPE.

06:04.333 --> 06:07.959
ME NEITHER.

06:07.959 --> 06:10.875
[SIGH]
MAYBE IT'S GENETIC.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.875
Realtor: THE HOUSE JUST WENT ON
THE MARKET A FEW DAYS AGO,

06:23.875 --> 06:27.291
AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT GOING TO
BE ON THE MARKET VERY LONG.

06:27.291 --> 06:30.083
MM-HMM. YOU KNOW,
I THINK IF WE TORE APART
THAT UPSTAIRS ROOM,

06:30.083 --> 06:31.375
IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT GYM.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.917
MMM. I WAS THINKING
THE EXACT SAME THING.

06:32.917 --> 06:33.458
LOTS OF STEEL, MAYBE--

06:33.458 --> 06:34.458
THAT'S MY ROOM.

06:34.458 --> 06:37.333
AND ALL THIS WALLPAPER
WOULD HAVE TO GO.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.667
WELL, THERE'S TONS
OF POSSIBILITIES.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.500
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK AROUND?

06:44.208 --> 06:46.000
YOU MUST BE JENNIFER.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.708
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.417
AND CONGRATULATIONS
ON BOSTON BAY COLLEGE,
BY THE WAY.

06:50.417 --> 06:51.875
I'M SORRY, BUT WHO ARE YOU?

06:51.875 --> 06:53.583
I'M DANA BORKOW.
I'M THE REALTOR.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.083
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.083
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
SELLING HER HOUSE.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.250
JOEY POTTER.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.750
I WAS HOPING TO RUN
INTO YOU.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.917
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. KUBELIK.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.417
YOU'RE COMING
TO MY PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT, YES?

07:10.417 --> 07:11.500
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.708
AND I HOPE
THAT YOU'RE BRINGING

07:12.708 --> 07:14.708
THAT CHARMING
BOYFRIEND OF YOURS.
PACEY, WAS IT?

07:14.708 --> 07:17.125
HE CERTAINLY DID
LIVEN UP THE LAST
PARTY.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.500
OH, UH--

07:18.500 --> 07:20.458
WELL, ACTUALLY, UM--

07:20.458 --> 07:23.375
CERTAIN THINGS HAVE
KIND OF CHANGED
SINCE THE LAST PARTY.

07:23.375 --> 07:27.166
UM, PACEY AND I, UH...

07:27.166 --> 07:28.000
WE, UH...

07:28.000 --> 07:30.583
WELL, WE--
WE KIND OF BROKE UP.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.875
OH. WELL, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

07:32.875 --> 07:35.834
WELL, I TAKE IT
YOU'RE STILL
ON GOOD TERMS, HUH?

07:36.959 --> 07:38.417
YEAH, SURE.
WE TALK ALL THE TIME.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.458
I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT,

07:39.458 --> 07:42.291
BECAUSE DEAN NEWMAN
AND I WERE HOPING

07:42.291 --> 07:43.333
TO CHAT WITH HIM
TOMORROW NIGHT

07:43.333 --> 07:44.834
ABOUT A RATHER
PRESSING MATTER.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.083
THE DEAN OF ADMISSIONS?

07:46.083 --> 07:49.917
YEAH, WE HAVE
AN OFFER WE WANT
TO DISCUSS WITH HIM.

07:49.917 --> 07:53.917
YEAH, SURE. I'M--I'M SURE
THAT PACEY WOULD LOVE
TO TALK TO YOU.

07:53.917 --> 07:56.083
OK. WELL, THEN
I'LL SEE YOU BOTH
TOMORROW NIGHT THEN.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.125
OK.

07:57.125 --> 07:58.125
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

07:58.125 --> 08:01.625
YOU, TOO.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.625
FORGIVE ME, JENNIFER,
I DIDN'T REALIZE I NEEDED

08:03.625 --> 08:05.625
YOUR PERMISSION
TO SELL MY OWN HOUSE.

08:05.625 --> 08:06.917
WELL, IT'S NOT
ABOUT PERMISSION,

08:06.917 --> 08:08.583
BUT SINCE YOU'RE BASICALLY
DOING THIS FOR ME,

08:08.583 --> 08:10.500
WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE
A SAY IN THE MATTER?

08:10.500 --> 08:13.125
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU?

08:13.125 --> 08:15.083
OK. I WANT YOU
TO LOOK ME IN THE EYES

08:15.083 --> 08:16.708
AND TELL ME THAT THIS
IS NOT ABOUT SENDING ME
TO COLLEGE.

08:16.708 --> 08:20.250
LOOK, I ADMIT THAT MONEY
FROM THE HOUSE

08:20.250 --> 08:22.417
WILL PRIMARILY GO
TOWARDS YOUR TUITION.

08:22.417 --> 08:23.750
BUT THAT IS NOT
THE ONLY REASON
FOR MY DECISION.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.000
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THEN BY ALL MEANS,
ENLIGHTEN ME.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.583
[SIGH]

08:29.583 --> 08:33.250
YOU ARE MOVING ON
TO THE NEXT PHASE
IN YOUR LIFE,

08:33.250 --> 08:35.582
AND I NEED TO DO
THE SAME.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.250
WHICH IS WHY
I'VE DECIDED TO MOVE

08:38.250 --> 08:40.582
TO LA BREA PARK.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.667
OK. RUN THAT BY ME
ONE MORE TIME

08:43.667 --> 08:44.375
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY
LA BREA PARK,

08:44.375 --> 08:47.500
I THINK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
WITH BUNNIES
AND LAWN BOWLING TOURNAMENTS,

08:48.500 --> 08:51.166
AND ASIDE
FROM YOUR HABITUAL KNITTING

08:51.166 --> 08:53.000
AND YOUR PENCHANT
FOR METAMUCIL, YOU--

08:53.000 --> 08:54.667
YOU'RE FAR TOO YOUNG
AND FAR TOO HIP

08:54.667 --> 08:56.417
TO BE LIVING
IN A PLACE LIKE THAT.

08:56.417 --> 08:58.667
JENNIFER,
JUST BECAUSE A COMMUNITY

08:58.667 --> 09:00.667
HAS THE WORD RETIREMENT
IN FRONT OF IT

09:00.667 --> 09:03.125
DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY
MEAN IT'S A BAD PLACE.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.625
OH, HONESTLY, JENNIFER,

09:04.625 --> 09:06.917
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE SUCH AN AGEIST.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.500
OH, I'M NOT AN AGEIST.
I'M NOT AN AGE--

09:09.500 --> 09:10.625
AN "IST" ANYTHING.

09:10.625 --> 09:14.542
I WANNA GO SEE
THIS FABULOUS PARK OF YOURS.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.166
HEY, YOU.

09:33.166 --> 09:35.583
HEY.

09:37.708 --> 09:41.583
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SIGN THAT...

09:42.375 --> 09:44.917
BEFORE YOU LEAVE TOWN.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.041
WELL, YOU'RE NOTHING
IF NOT DIRECT.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.542
WERE YOU REALLY JUST GONNA
SLIP OUT OF TOWN

09:52.542 --> 09:53.458
WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOOD-BYE?

09:53.458 --> 09:55.625
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT,
YEAH. MAYBE.

09:55.625 --> 09:56.625
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEN IN THAT CASE,

09:56.625 --> 09:57.917
JUST PRETEND
I NEVER DID STOP BY.

09:57.917 --> 10:00.083
OR MAYBE I WAS
THINKING ABOUT

10:00.083 --> 10:00.750
HOW TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOU ALL WEEK.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.000
SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.041
BACK TO SCHOOL.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.125
I SIGNED UP
FOR SOME
SUMMER CLASSES

10:17.125 --> 10:19.583
TO MAKE UP SOME
OF THE UNITS
I MISSED THIS YEAR.

10:19.583 --> 10:22.583
[DEEP BREATH]
HOW SOON DO CLASSES START?

10:22.583 --> 10:24.083
NOT FOR OVER A MONTH.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.583
OK.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.834
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE ROAD TRIP
BEFORE THAT.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.959
DO SOME TRAVELING
WHILE I STILL HAVE
THE TIME.

10:29.959 --> 10:34.625
IT, UH...SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.083
I LEAVE THE DAY
AFTER TOMORROW.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.166
DO YOU?

10:40.166 --> 10:43.458
THAT SOON?

10:43.458 --> 10:44.625
I KNOW.

10:44.625 --> 10:48.000
THAT'S--THAT'S...

10:48.000 --> 10:50.792
THAT'S REALLY SOON.
I FEEL ILL-PREPARED.

10:52.708 --> 10:56.125
WELL, YOU STILL HAVE
A WHOLE DAY AND A HALF

10:56.125 --> 10:58.625
TO COME UP WITH SOME
FANTASTIC GOING AWAY
SPEECH FOR ME.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.667
ALL RIGHT.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.917
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO SIGN THAT.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.542
CAN I?

11:10.667 --> 11:12.708
CAN I HAVE
SOME TIME WITH IT?

11:12.708 --> 11:16.834
SURE. YEAH.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.000
JUST AS LONG AS YOU REALIZE
THAT THE LONGER YOU HAVE IT,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.667
THE LESS ACCEPTABLE
"HAVE A BITCHIN' SUMMER"
IS GONNA BE.

11:23.875 --> 11:27.375
OK.

11:29.375 --> 11:29.875
OK.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.208
[SIGH]

11:52.375 --> 11:54.125
HEY.

11:54.125 --> 11:57.166
I WAS BEGINNING
TO WONDER IF YOU WERE
EVER GONNA KNOCK.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.166
YOU SAW ME STANDING
OUT HERE?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.166
NO.

12:06.583 --> 12:10.458
OK, UM...[CLEARS THROAT]

12:10.458 --> 12:12.500
HERE'S THE THING.
UM...

12:12.500 --> 12:15.291
I RAN INTO MR. KUBELIK TODAY.
REMEMBER HIM?

12:15.291 --> 12:17.625
HE'S THE WORTHINGTON GUY
AND HE REMEMBERED YOU,

12:17.625 --> 12:19.625
AND HE ASKED ME TO BRING YOU
TO THIS PARTY

12:19.625 --> 12:21.458
THAT THEY'RE HAVING
TOMORROW NIGHT
FOR ALL THE NEW FRESHMEN.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.291
AND HE THOUGHT
THAT WE WERE STILL TOGETHER,

12:23.291 --> 12:24.333
AND I SAID THAT THINGS
WERE WEIRD BETWEEN US.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.000
BUT THEN HE SAID
HE HAD THIS OFFER FOR YOU

12:26.000 --> 12:27.333
AND HE MENTIONED
THE DEAN OF ADMISSIONS,

12:27.333 --> 12:29.000
AND I'M THINKING WHAT ELSE
COULD HE BE TALKING ABOUT

12:29.000 --> 12:30.625
OTHER THAN WORTHINGTON
AND YOU.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.583
AND, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THERE'S SOME LOOPHOLE
OR HE--

12:32.583 --> 12:34.959
THERE'S SOME
SPECIAL PROGRAM AND I--

12:34.959 --> 12:35.959
I MISS YOU, JO.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.750
I MISS YOU, TOO.

12:50.542 --> 12:53.375
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN...

12:53.375 --> 12:56.333
REPLAYING EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED
AT THAT STUPID PROM.

12:58.917 --> 13:03.750
WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO END LIKE THAT.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.500
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO END LIKE THAT.
RIGHT?

13:12.834 --> 13:15.792
I WISH YOU'D COME
TO THE PARTY WITH ME.

13:18.041 --> 13:21.125
YEAH. OF COURSE.

13:22.959 --> 13:26.834
AND, UH--

13:26.834 --> 13:28.417
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.542
OK. SO
RIDDLE ME THIS.

13:51.542 --> 13:53.792
HOW MANY FUNYONS
CAN A TINY LITTLE
WOMAN LIKE YOU

13:53.792 --> 13:55.792
POSSIBLY CONSUME
ON ONE LITTLE
ROAD TRIP?

13:55.792 --> 13:57.083
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.625
I'M NOT CHANGING
THE SUBJECT.

13:58.625 --> 14:01.291
I'M JUST STEERING IT
IN A DIFFERENT
DIRECTION ON PURPOSE.

14:01.291 --> 14:04.125
LOOK, I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO TO THE PARTY
TONIGHT, PACE.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.291
I MEAN, EVEN IF YOU AND JOEY
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER,

14:06.291 --> 14:08.166
YOU BOTH NEED TO TAKE
SOME TIME APART

14:08.166 --> 14:09.333
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WENT WRONG.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.834
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA
WIND UP MAKING

14:10.834 --> 14:11.834
THE SAME MISTAKES
ALL OVER AGAIN.

14:11.834 --> 14:14.667
TRUST ME. I KNOW
FROM WHENCE I SPEAK.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.250
TRUST YOU?

14:16.250 --> 14:17.625
MISS PACK-UP-AND-LEAVE-TOWN?

14:17.625 --> 14:18.875
FORGIVE ME
IF YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY

14:18.875 --> 14:19.875
MY RELATIONSHIP ROLE MODEL
RIGHT NOW.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.667
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP,
PACE.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.041
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
YOU GETTING HURT.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.834
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
I'M ALREADY HURT.

14:26.834 --> 14:29.667
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
THE SITUATION
I'M TRYING TO RECTIFY.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.125
THAT'S WHY I GOTTA GO
TO THIS PARTY,

14:31.125 --> 14:32.375
JUST TO SEE WHAT THE GODS
HAVE IN STORE FOR ME.

14:32.375 --> 14:35.542
YOU MEAN KUBELIK
AND HIS MYSTERIOUS
OFFER?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.792
YEAH.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.166
LOOK, I KNOW AS WELL AS YOU DO
THAT THIS IS A LONG SHOT.

14:39.166 --> 14:43.875
BUT WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DO I HAVE? I NEED A SIGN.

14:43.875 --> 14:47.041
I NEED SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.542
TO SHOW ME WHAT'S RIGHT
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.083
AND IF THIS GUY'S GONNA
OFFER ME A CHANCE
TO GO TO WORTHINGTON,

14:52.083 --> 14:55.542
THEN I HAVE MY ANSWER
AND I KNOW FOR SURE.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.917
WHAT WILL YOU KNOW?

14:59.041 --> 15:01.792
WELL, THAT I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE WITH HER.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.333
AH, LOOK. GRETCH?

15:10.333 --> 15:11.291
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU
I THINK I'M GONNA WALK HOME.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.041
YEAH.

15:16.417 --> 15:19.834
SO, THEN...

15:19.834 --> 15:22.000
THIS IS IT. YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA LEAVE TOMORROW MORNING?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.250
WELL, LONG BEFORE
YOU'RE UP, SNOOZER.

15:28.583 --> 15:32.166
HEY! WHAT'S THIS?
HA HA.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.125
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU CAME HOME THIS YEAR,
GRETCHEN.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.333
SURE YOU ARE. YOU GOT
A SWEET BEACH HOUSE
OUT OF THE DEAL.

15:36.333 --> 15:37.750
YEAH, I DID.
BUT IT WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN THE SAME

15:37.750 --> 15:40.917
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

15:40.917 --> 15:45.166
SO, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER--

15:45.166 --> 15:47.041
WELL, YOU KNOW.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.250
I LOVE YOU, TOO, PACE.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.083
YEAH.
[LAUGHS]

15:50.083 --> 15:51.083
AND EVEN BETTER
THAN THAT--

15:51.083 --> 15:53.750
I MEAN, ALL FAMILIAL
OBLIGATIONS ASIDE--

15:53.750 --> 15:55.583
I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.291
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
SO BAD YOURSELF.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.875
YEAH, I KNOW.

16:01.834 --> 16:02.083
GOOD-BYE, GRETCHEN.

16:05.542 --> 16:07.500
GOOD-BYE.
BYE.

16:16.875 --> 16:17.917
LAST NAME?

16:17.917 --> 16:19.583
OH, HELLO. UM--

16:19.583 --> 16:20.458
I WAS HERE
A FEW DAYS AGO--

16:20.458 --> 16:21.708
LAST NAME?

16:21.708 --> 16:24.750
RYAN. EVELYN RYAN.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.417
Jen: HUH.
SHE'S A CRUSTY OLD BROAD.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.542
I WONDER WHAT SHE'D DO
IF WE JUST GUNNED IT?

16:28.542 --> 16:29.625
I MEAN, HOW WOULD
SHE CATCH US?

16:29.625 --> 16:32.041
IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE
GOLF CARTS, YOU THINK?

16:32.041 --> 16:32.750
YOU KNOW, I SERIOUSLY THINK
WE COULD TAKE HER.

16:32.750 --> 16:33.750
JENNIFER, PLEASE.

16:33.750 --> 16:37.458
JUST MAKING A JOKE.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.708
HERE YOU GO.

16:38.708 --> 16:41.041
NEXT TIME GO
TO GATE 3 FIRST
TO GET YOUR PASS.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.625
OH, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE--

16:43.625 --> 16:44.500
EVERYONE NEEDS A PASS.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.458
RESIDENTS GET
A PERMANENT PASS.

16:46.458 --> 16:47.667
IF THEY HAVE VISITORS,

16:47.667 --> 16:50.000
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO CALL IN ADVANCE
TO GET A PASS.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.208
NOBODY GETS IN
WITHOUT A PASS.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.791
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DID IT, DAWSON,

17:04.791 --> 17:06.000
BUT YOU MANAGED
TO MAKE MR. BROOKS

17:06.000 --> 17:07.500
SEEM LIKE HARRISON FORD.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.666
SO IT'S OK THEN?

17:08.666 --> 17:10.500
WELL, AS YOUR FATHER,
I AM PRONE TO SUBJECTIVITY,

17:10.500 --> 17:12.083
BUT WHEN USC CALLS
AND BEGS YOU TO JOIN
THEIR PROGRAM,

17:12.083 --> 17:13.666
REMEMBER YOU HEARD IT
HERE FIRST.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.375
IT IS GREAT.

17:16.375 --> 17:21.165
BUT I CAN SEE
THAT YOUR MIND'S
ON OTHER THINGS.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.666
[SIGH]

17:22.666 --> 17:24.708
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

17:24.708 --> 17:26.083
NOT REALLY.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.416
BUT THANK YOU
FOR WATCHING THIS.

17:28.416 --> 17:31.000
I REALLY NEEDED
AN OPINION FROM SOMEBODY
OTHER THAN BROOKS.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.708
YOU KNOW? I MEAN,
HOW COULD A MAN
WITH AN EGO THAT BIG

17:34.708 --> 17:36.250
NOT LOVE A MOVIE
THAT'S ALL ABOUT HIM?

17:38.041 --> 17:41.875
THAT MAN WAS A REAL
WILD CARD, HUH?

17:41.875 --> 17:46.291
I CAN'T GET OVER HOW MUCH
HE REMINDED ME OF YOU.

17:46.291 --> 17:47.500
I REMIND YOU OF HIM?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.250
WELL, THAT PART WHERE
HE TALKS ABOUT THAT GIRL?

17:50.250 --> 17:52.000
HOW SHE JUMPED
OVER THE COUNTER,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.291
THEY WENT OFF
TO CALIFORNIA TOGETHER,

17:53.291 --> 17:55.208
THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EACH OTHER? WHO DOES THAT?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.125
HITCHHIKERS.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.542
RISK TAKERS. DREAMERS.

17:58.542 --> 18:01.542
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND
THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

18:01.542 --> 18:04.083
AN OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTS ITSELF.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.875
AND WHATEVER THEY DECIDE
TO DO IN THAT MOMENT

18:05.875 --> 18:10.250
WILL CHANGE THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES FOREVER.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.667
BROOKS COULD HAVE TOLD
THAT GIRL TO GET LOST.

18:12.667 --> 18:13.792
HE COULD HAVE GONE OFF
TO CALIFORNIA ALONE
LIKE HE PLANNED,

18:13.792 --> 18:16.667
BUT HE DIDN'T.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.708
NO, HE DIDN'T.
BECAUSE HE KNEW.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.500
VERY FEW MEN
ARE LUCKY ENOUGH

18:20.500 --> 18:22.750
TO ACTUALLY SEE
THOSE MOMENTS, DAWSON.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.208
HE WAS REALLY
AN INSPIRATION.

18:28.458 --> 18:31.875
YEAH. I...

18:31.875 --> 18:33.708
I GUESS HE IS.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.417
HEY.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.250
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO WAIT OUTSIDE FOR ME.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.333
I WOULD'VE RUNG THE DOORBELL
LIKE A PROPER GENTLEMAN.

18:54.333 --> 18:58.166
I'VE BEEN READY FOR AN HOUR,
WHICH HAS GIVEN ME

18:58.166 --> 18:59.792
FAR TOO MUCH TIME TO LOOK
AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

18:59.792 --> 19:00.959
NEVER A GOOD THING.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.291
RIGHT.

19:07.708 --> 19:10.417
UM...WE SHOULD GO.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.250
YEAH. GOOD IDEA.
[CLEARS THROAT]

19:13.667 --> 19:17.291
[SIGH]

19:30.708 --> 19:32.125
YOU'RE NOT MOVING THERE.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.542
I'VE LOOKED
AT OTHER PLACES.

19:33.542 --> 19:34.834
THEY ARE SIMPLY
NOT AFFORDABLE.

19:34.834 --> 19:38.000
I'M SURE WITH TIME
I'LL BE ABLE
TO ACCLIMATE

19:38.000 --> 19:39.500
TO LA BREA PARK
QUITE NICELY.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.625
OK, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO ME.

19:40.625 --> 19:41.375
SEE, I'M NOT GONNA
ALLOW YOU TO MAKE

19:41.375 --> 19:42.542
SUCH AN ENORMOUS
SACRIFICE.

19:42.542 --> 19:47.000
THIS IS NOT A SACRIFICE.
THIS IS MY GIFT TO YOU.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.959
WELL, I DON'T WANT IT.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.250
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE?

19:50.250 --> 19:52.041
NO. NO, NOT LIKE THIS.

19:52.041 --> 19:55.166
THE FACT IS
IS THAT I SHOULD'VE APPLIED
FOR A STUDENT LOAN.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.834
JUST BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
TAKE MONEY FROM MY PARENTS

19:56.834 --> 19:58.208
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I NEED
TO BURDEN YOU

19:58.208 --> 19:59.834
WITH MY ENTIRE
COLLEGE TUITION.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.667
[SIGH]

20:01.667 --> 20:03.667
LOOK, WHEN YOU OFFERED
TO HELP ME OUT,

20:03.667 --> 20:07.000
I--I ASSUMED THAT YOU
HAD SOME SORT OF SAVINGS.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.291
I DIDN'T THINK THAT I WAS
GONNA PUT YOU INTO HOCK.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.625
JENNIFER, THIS IS
NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.542
LOOK, CAN WE PLEASE
NOT HAVE THIS CONVERSATION?

20:13.542 --> 20:14.625
I'M NOT GOING TO BOSTON,

20:14.625 --> 20:16.500
AND I'M NOT LETTING YOU
SELL THIS HOUSE.

20:20.625 --> 20:23.250
[SIGH]

20:25.708 --> 20:27.708
HEY.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.917
HEY. IT'S 7:00
AND THE PARTY'S
ALREADY SWINGING.

20:29.917 --> 20:31.875
I'M IMPRESSED.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.000
WELL, I TAKE NO CREDIT.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.917
THE PROMISE OF FREE FOOD
ALWAYS DRAWS A CROWD.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.417
YOU LOOK LOVELY, JOEY.

20:36.417 --> 20:39.041
AND I SEE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR FRIEND.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.959
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, MR. KUBELIK.

20:40.959 --> 20:41.917
THANKS FOR INVITING
ME TONIGHT.

20:41.917 --> 20:43.375
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.708
OH, WELL, THAT'S PACEY.

20:44.708 --> 20:45.875
HE NEVER MISSES
AN OPPORTUNITY

20:45.875 --> 20:48.917
TO SHOW HIMSELF OFF
IN A SUIT.

20:48.917 --> 20:50.375
I THINK WE'VE
GATHERED EVERYONE
BY THE FIREPLACE, SIR.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.708
WONDERFUL. JOEY,
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN BRAD?

20:53.708 --> 20:55.917
WE'RE TAKING
A FEW PHOTOGRAPHS
OF NEXT YEAR'S FRESHMEN.

20:55.917 --> 20:56.917
I'LL LEAD THE WAY.

20:56.917 --> 20:57.959
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

20:57.959 --> 21:00.417
OK.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.083
SO. WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU AND I GO FIND
THAT DEAN OF YOURS, HUH?

21:08.083 --> 21:12.375
ALL RIGHT.
[CHUCKLES]

21:18.375 --> 21:19.583
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
LEAVING TILL TOMORROW.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.792
HEY, UH, NO. I WAS JUST
PRE-PACKING THE CAR.

21:22.792 --> 21:25.333
WHAT'S UP?

21:29.041 --> 21:31.291
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.625
W-WHAT? WHY?

21:35.625 --> 21:39.250
BECAUSE IF YOU
LEAVE NOW, I AM ALWAYS
GONNA WONDER "WHAT IF?"

21:39.250 --> 21:41.792
WHAT IF THERE WERE
NO PENDING COLLEGE
DEPARTURES?

21:41.792 --> 21:43.500
WHAT IF THERE WERE
NO JOB OFFERS IN BOSTON?

21:43.500 --> 21:45.834
WHAT IF THERE
WAS NO JOEY. WHAT IF IT
WAS JUST YOU AND ME,

21:45.834 --> 21:48.625
ON THE OPEN ROAD,
WITH NOTHING BUT
OUR HEARTS TO GUIDE US?

21:48.625 --> 21:50.083
WOULD WE HAVE WORKED?

21:50.083 --> 21:52.875
YOU SAID THE REASON
WE BROKE UP IS BECAUSE
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.

21:52.875 --> 21:56.166
FINE.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.291
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
AND JUST...

21:58.291 --> 21:58.542
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.125
DAWSON, THIS IS CRAZY.
I MEAN, COME ON,

22:04.125 --> 22:05.542
YOU CAN'T JUST
PICK UP AND LEAVE.

22:05.542 --> 22:08.083
WHY NOT? GIVE ME
ONE GOOD REASON.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.917
OK, UM, GRADUATION.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.792
I MEAN, YOUR CEREMONY'S
LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY.

22:11.792 --> 22:12.834
YOU MEAN THE CEREMONY
WHERE I SIT THERE

22:12.834 --> 22:15.083
AND LISTEN TO OTHER
PEOPLE TALK FOR 3 HOURS?

22:15.083 --> 22:18.000
BEFORE I WALK ACROSS
THE FOOTBALL FIELD
IN A GOOFY CAP AND GOWN,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.166
TO PICK UP A PIECE
OF PAPER, WHICH ISN'T
EVEN A REAL DIPLOMA?

22:20.166 --> 22:21.542
I'M SORRY,
THAT EXPERIENCE
IS NOT RICH ENOUGH

22:21.542 --> 22:24.458
TO WARRANT ME
LYING AWAKE AT NIGHT,

22:24.458 --> 22:26.291
REGRETTING THAT I
DID NOT HAVE THE GUTS

22:26.291 --> 22:27.375
TO TAKE THIS TRIP
WITH YOU.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.667
FINE. OK,
FORGET GRADUATION.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.000
I'M GONNA STICK
WITH MY FIRST REASON.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.458
WHICH WAS?

22:33.458 --> 22:35.291
THIS IS CRAZY!
YEAH.

22:35.291 --> 22:37.667
IT IS. IT'S NUTS!
IT'S COMPLETELY
LUDICROUS.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.041
AND YOU CAN'T THINK
OF ONE GOOD REASON

22:39.041 --> 22:40.625
WHY I SHOULD NOT
COME WITH YOU,
GRETCHEN.

22:40.625 --> 22:45.041
SOMETHING IN MY GUT
IS TELLING ME THAT THIS
IS OUR MOMENT.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.500
WE CAN'T
LET THIS SLIP BY.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.375
DAWSON, I--

22:57.917 --> 22:59.500
JUST SAY YES.

23:01.708 --> 23:02.667
YES.

23:18.959 --> 23:21.000
DAWSON...

23:21.000 --> 23:22.208
HEY, THERE,
BEAUTIFUL.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.834
HONEY, I HAVE GOT
A CRISIS DOWN
AT THE RESTAURANT.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.041
I WAS WONDERING,
COULD YOU WATCH HER
FOR A FEW HOURS?

23:26.041 --> 23:27.917
I WOULD LOVE TO.

23:27.917 --> 23:33.375
SHE IS SO GOOD WITH YOU.
I SWEAR, SHE KNOWS YOU
ALREADY.

23:33.375 --> 23:37.291
OH, UM, DID YOU
GET A CHANCE TO TALK
TO GRETCHEN YET?

23:37.291 --> 23:39.750
UM, YEAH.
SHE'S COMING
OVER TONIGHT.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.417
OH, GOOD, HONEY.
I'M GLAD YOU 2 ARE
WORKING THINGS OUT.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.417
GOOD-BYE,
SWEETHEART.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.583
DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT. THAT WAS
TECHNICALLY NOT A LIE.

23:53.583 --> 23:54.917
THAT WAS A LIE
BY OMISSION.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.000
IT'S NOT THE SAME
THING AT ALL.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.708
[BABY COOS]

23:59.708 --> 24:01.417
[SIGH]

24:04.583 --> 24:06.792
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THE WHOLE
MOM AND DAD THING.

24:06.792 --> 24:07.875
I MEAN, YEAH,
IT IS A BIG DEAL

24:07.875 --> 24:09.917
TO WATCH THEIR SON
GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

24:09.917 --> 24:11.792
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I'M SAVING THEM

24:11.792 --> 24:14.917
FROM AN EXCRUCIATINGLY
LONG CEREMONY. THAT'S
A GIFT RIGHT THERE.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.875
[BABY COOING]

24:19.458 --> 24:21.125
ALL RIGHT,
SO IT'S NOT A GIFT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:21.125 --> 24:22.542
HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE
I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT

24:22.542 --> 24:23.792
TO DISAPPOINT THEM
A LITTLE BIT.

24:23.792 --> 24:25.250
I MEAN, I'VE SPENT
THE LAST 18 YEARS

24:25.250 --> 24:26.625
MAKING EVERYBODY
AROUND ME HAPPY.

24:26.625 --> 24:28.667
I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME
I PURSUED A LITTLE
HAPPINESS OF MY OWN.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.667
BUT IF IT'S NOT GUILT,
THEN WHY AM I HAVING
SUCH A HARD TIME

24:41.667 --> 24:42.875
WRITING THIS LETTER?

24:49.625 --> 24:51.375
PACEY, YOU'VE MET
THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE.

24:51.375 --> 24:54.959
THIS IS OUR DEAN
OF ADMISSIONS,
ANDREW HILL NEWMAN.

24:54.959 --> 24:56.208
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
MR. NEWMAN,

24:56.208 --> 24:58.208
OR DEAN NEWMAN,
WHICHEVER YOU PREFER.

24:58.208 --> 24:59.625
NICE TO MEET YOU,
PACEY.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.750
MR. KUBELIK'S TOLD ME
ALL SORTS OF WONDERFUL
THINGS ABOUT YOU.

25:01.750 --> 25:05.125
ANDREW HERE
IS CHARTERING MY BOAT
FOR THE SUMMER.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.667
IS THAT RIGHT?

25:06.667 --> 25:09.583
YES, I'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE A TRIP AROUND
THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS.

25:09.583 --> 25:12.333
I'VE HEARD THAT YOU
SPENT LAST SUMMER SAILING.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.792
I DID INDEED.

25:13.792 --> 25:16.834
FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE
SPENDING LONG PERIODS
OF TIME AT SEA?

25:16.834 --> 25:19.750
WELL, I FEEL ABOUT
AS COMFORTABLE AS A KID
IN A CANDY STORE, YEAH.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.750
THIS COULD WORK.

25:20.750 --> 25:21.792
I THOUGHT SO.

25:21.792 --> 25:23.166
WHAT COULD WORK?

25:23.166 --> 25:27.333
PACEY, HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO WORK ON MY YACHT
FOR THE SUMMER,

25:27.333 --> 25:30.458
AS ONE OF THE DECK HANDS?

25:36.333 --> 25:38.834
IS THAT ALL YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT,
IS A SUMMER JOB?

25:38.834 --> 25:41.166
YEAH, IF YOU HAVEN'T
GOT ONE ALREADY.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.583
THE PAY ISN'T THE GREATEST,
BUT YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO YOURSELF

25:43.583 --> 25:46.041
TO EXPLORE THE ISLANDS,
AND IT SHOULD BE

25:46.041 --> 25:47.875
AN EXPERIENCE
THAT YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.

25:47.875 --> 25:52.959
WELL, THIS IS, UH...
A LITTLE UNEXPECTED.

25:52.959 --> 25:55.875
BUT I'M REALLY,
I'M TRULY FLATTERED,
GENTLEMEN.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.417
WELL, TAKE SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

25:57.417 --> 25:59.750
OK. IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU, SIR.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.208
YES. THANK YOU.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.333
SO, BOTTOM LINE
IS THAT I'LL GET
TO BOSTON BAY EVENTUALLY,

26:21.333 --> 26:23.708
I'LL JUST,
UM, GO TO STATE
FOR A FEW SEMESTERS

26:23.708 --> 26:26.583
AND--AND SAVE THE MONEY
THAT I WOULD HAVE SPENT
ON TUITION AND DORM

26:26.583 --> 26:27.792
AND I'LL MEET YOU THERE
IN, LIKE, A YEAR OR 2.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.708
JACK, I'M SURE
THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
MY SITUATION HERE.

26:34.708 --> 26:37.417
I--I MEAN, I CAN HARDLY
ALLOW MY GRANDMOTHER

26:37.417 --> 26:40.125
TO--TO LIVE A DESTITUTE
EXISTENCE IN SOME
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY

26:40.125 --> 26:43.458
JUST SO THAT I CAN
ENJOY, YOU KNOW,
FRAT PARTIES

26:43.458 --> 26:45.959
AND HIGHER EDUCATION.
IT'S NOT RIGHT,
AND I WON'T DO IT.

26:45.959 --> 26:48.166
MM-HMM.
THIS IS AWFUL FOAMY.

26:48.166 --> 26:50.125
[SNIFFS]

26:51.750 --> 26:55.750
OK, LISTEN...
GRAMS NEEDS ME.

26:55.750 --> 26:58.750
WHEN I CAME HERE
3 YEARS AGO,
SHE TOOK ME IN.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.250
SHE TOOK CARE OF ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO NOW?

27:00.250 --> 27:01.625
JUST TURN MY BACK
ON HER?

27:01.625 --> 27:03.583
NO, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND.

27:03.583 --> 27:04.959
YEAH?

27:04.959 --> 27:07.375
MM-HMM. YEAH, I THINK
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
FOR YOUR GRANDMOTHER

27:07.375 --> 27:10.417
IS BEAUTIFUL
AND AWFULLY SELFLESS.

27:11.375 --> 27:13.750
THANKS.
MM-HMM.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.125
JUST A LITTLE BIT
CONVENIENT, THOUGH.

27:15.125 --> 27:18.208
I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING ELSE
COMING. ALL RIGHT.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.834
HOW DO YOU COME UP
WITH CONVENIENT?

27:19.834 --> 27:21.166
WELL, I CAN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE THAT,

27:21.166 --> 27:24.625
ALTHOUGH YOU'RE
CLEARLY SWIMMING
IN A VAT OF GUILT

27:24.625 --> 27:27.792
OVER LEAVING
YOUR BEST FRIEND
IN A LURCH LIKE THIS,

27:27.792 --> 27:30.417
YOU ALSO SEEM TO BE
JUST A BIT, UH, RELIEVED.

27:30.417 --> 27:33.291
IT'S AS IF YOU'RE HAPPY
TO HAVE FOUND SOMETHING
TO GET YOU OFF THE HOOK,

27:33.291 --> 27:35.125
SO THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO AWAY
TO COLLEGE.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.875
AND NOT ONLY DO YOU
NOT HAVE TO GO,

27:36.875 --> 27:39.583
YOU THEN BECOME
JEN OF ARC,
THE MARTYR-SAINT,

27:39.583 --> 27:41.166
WILLING TO SACRIFICE
HER OWN HAPPINESS

27:41.166 --> 27:42.792
FOR THE SAKE OF HER
GRANDMOTHER'S.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.208
JACK, THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
ALL RIGHT?

27:44.208 --> 27:46.125
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD I NOT WANT
TO GO AWAY TO COLLEGE?

27:46.125 --> 27:50.000
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED.
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.625
YOU'RE LEAVING
THE ONLY TOWN IN WHICH
YOU EVER FELT SAFE.

27:51.625 --> 27:55.917
THE ONLY PERSON WHO--
WHO CARED ENOUGH TO DEVOTE
HER ENTIRE LIFE TO YOU.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.583
OK, I'M--I HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, BUY, UM--

28:03.583 --> 28:06.625
BUT IT--IT'S NOT
THAT EASY.

28:06.625 --> 28:08.375
I MEAN, I CAN'T
JUST LEAVE HER ALONE.

28:08.375 --> 28:09.959
I'M NOT
SAYING YOU SHOULD.

28:09.959 --> 28:12.834
LOOK, I KNOW GRAMS
NEEDS YOU, BUT YOU
NEED HER JUST AS MUCH,

28:12.834 --> 28:14.834
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

28:17.375 --> 28:22.250
I'M NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT
THAT I'D BE SCARED TO GO
TO SCHOOL WITHOUT YOU.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.458
OK, I ADMIT IT.

28:27.458 --> 28:32.500
I'M AN 18-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
WHO'S AFRAID TO BE
AWAY FROM HER GRAMMY.

28:32.500 --> 28:32.875
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

28:35.250 --> 28:35.875
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

28:49.375 --> 28:51.959
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

28:51.959 --> 28:52.959
BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

28:56.542 --> 28:57.792
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:59.000 --> 29:02.959
UM, WELL...

29:02.959 --> 29:06.792
KUBELIK WANTS ME
TO WORK ON HIS BOAT
THIS SUMMER.

29:06.792 --> 29:08.333
THAT'S WHAT
THE OFFER WAS ABOUT.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.375
IT DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH
GOING TO WORTHINGTON.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.208
LET'S GO.

29:25.083 --> 29:28.041
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'LL GO.

29:28.041 --> 29:31.458
BUT I THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD
STAY HERE, JO.

29:31.458 --> 29:34.375
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU IN THERE.
YOU'VE BEEN...

29:34.375 --> 29:36.291
GLIDING FROM
CONVERSATION
TO CONVERSATION

29:36.291 --> 29:38.834
WITH COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE AND EASE
THIS TIME.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.250
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
REMEMBER THE LAST
WORTHINGTON PARTY

29:42.250 --> 29:44.667
THAT YOU AND I
ATTENDED TOGETHER,
BUT...

29:44.667 --> 29:46.542
YOU WERE KIND OF
A JUMBLE OF NERVES.

29:50.458 --> 29:53.000
I GUESS I WAS
KIND OF HOPING THAT...

29:53.000 --> 29:55.875
YOU WOULD NEED FOR ME
TO BE YOUR SAVIOR
AGAIN TONIGHT.

29:57.458 --> 30:01.917
BUT...THAT'S NO LONGER
THE CASE.

30:04.542 --> 30:07.500
YOU DON'T NEED THAT
NOW. EVERYTHING'S
DIFFERENT.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.792
I THINK THAT THEY'RE
BETTER THIS WAY.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.792
THE ONLY THING
THAT REMAINS THE SAME

30:15.792 --> 30:17.041
IS YOU'RE STILL
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL
IN THE ROOM.

30:20.125 --> 30:21.000
PACE--
JO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
I MEAN, THIS IS IT NOW.
THIS IS...

30:25.000 --> 30:28.667
THIS IS YOUR LIFE,
AND YOU SHOULD ENJOY IT.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.458
HOW CAN I ENJOY IT
WITHOUT YOU?

30:38.250 --> 30:39.417
LET'S GO.

30:53.375 --> 30:54.875
[QUIETLY]
HEY.

30:54.875 --> 30:57.375
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU WERE
GOING TO GET HERE.

30:57.375 --> 30:57.834
ARE YOU DONE
PACKING?

30:57.834 --> 30:59.875
YEAH, YEAH.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.458
BUT YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY
MAKING YOUR OWN BOXES
IS REALLY EASY?

31:02.458 --> 31:04.291
YEAH.
THEY LIED.

31:04.291 --> 31:05.708
SHE SLEEPING?

31:05.708 --> 31:07.792
YEAH, SHE WENT DOWN
ABOUT HALF
AN HOUR AGO.

31:07.792 --> 31:09.083
AW...

31:10.583 --> 31:11.792
CUTE.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.333
[GRETCHEN CHUCKLES]
OK, CAN I JUST SAY

31:19.333 --> 31:22.041
THAT YOU'RE THE CUTEST
THING IN THE WORLD
RIGHT NOW?

31:22.041 --> 31:24.000
WHY?
LOOK AT YOU,
ALL PAPA DAWSON.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.458
I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD
GET SO INTO THIS STUFF.

31:28.458 --> 31:29.834
YOU KNOW? BUT--

31:29.834 --> 31:31.750
I MEAN, I WAS HAPPY ABOUT
THE IDEA OF A BABY SISTER,

31:31.750 --> 31:35.667
BUT I JUST...I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD GET THIS ATTACHED.

31:35.667 --> 31:39.500
SHE'S SO SMALL AND--
AND PERFECT AND...

31:39.500 --> 31:42.542
HELPLESS. WHEN
SHE SMILES, IT JUST...

31:42.542 --> 31:45.542
UHH. IT JUST
BREAKS MY HEART.

31:47.542 --> 31:50.041
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH I'M GONNA MISS
WHEN I'M IN SCHOOL.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.083
BY THE TIME I GET BACK
SHE'S GONNA BE

31:51.083 --> 31:54.875
THIS FULLY WALKING,
TALKING LITTLE PERSON.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.208
THAT'S TRUE.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.959
SHE AND ALEXANDER
ARE GONNA BE ABOUT
THE SAME AGE, SO...

31:59.959 --> 32:02.834
I WONDER IF THEY'LL
END UP CLIMBING IN AND OUT
OF EACH OTHER'S WINDOWS.

32:02.834 --> 32:05.542
YOU KNOW,
BECOMING BEST FRIENDS.

32:16.667 --> 32:19.125
SO, HOW DID IT GO
WITH THAT LETTER
TO YOUR PARENTS?

32:20.625 --> 32:22.917
I'M, UH...
STILL WORKING ON IT.

32:22.917 --> 32:23.917
WELL, YOU THINK
THAT ONE'S HARD,

32:23.917 --> 32:26.750
WAIT UNTIL YOU TRY
TO WRITE JOEY'S.

32:26.750 --> 32:28.583
THAT'S OK, DAWSON.
I EXPECTED YOU TO.

32:28.583 --> 32:30.542
OK.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.667
WELL, I SHOULD GET BACK.

32:36.667 --> 32:39.083
I MAY BE DONE PACKING,
BUT THE CLEANING
FESTIVITIES

32:39.083 --> 32:40.208
HAVE ONLY JUST BEGUN.

32:42.417 --> 32:43.417
GOOD LUCK.

32:43.417 --> 32:44.625
THANKS.

33:00.041 --> 33:01.208
GOOD-BYE.

33:02.417 --> 33:03.875
BYE.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.875
SO, UH...
GOOD NIGHT.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.083
THANKS FOR COMING,
PACE.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.750
WELL, THANKS
FOR ASKING.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.083
I JUST,
I'M SORRY--

33:33.083 --> 33:33.291
I'M SORRY.

33:36.333 --> 33:39.542
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO BE
SORRY FOR, JO.

33:39.542 --> 33:41.625
IT'S ME.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.792
SO I--
PACE...

33:48.834 --> 33:51.166
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
I COULD COME AND STAY
WITH YOU TONIGHT?

33:54.959 --> 33:58.333
WE COULD JUST...SLEEP.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.208
YEAH.

34:19.041 --> 34:21.542
SO...DID YOU TALK
TO JACK LAST NIGHT?

34:21.542 --> 34:24.166
DID HE TELL YOU
YOU WERE MAKING
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE

34:24.166 --> 34:26.125
OF YOUR LIFE?

34:26.125 --> 34:28.333
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO "GOOD MORNING"?

34:28.333 --> 34:29.750
OR "HAVE SOME JAVA"?

34:29.750 --> 34:32.875
I WOULD NEVER REFER
TO COFFEE AS JAVA.
NOW, WHAT DID JACK SAY?

34:32.875 --> 34:35.792
OH, YOU KNOW. STUFF.

34:35.792 --> 34:36.875
[COFFEE GRINDER STARTS]

34:36.875 --> 34:39.458
COULD YOU BE A LITTLE
MORE SPECIFIC, PLEASE?

34:39.458 --> 34:42.625
WHAT'S THAT? I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
OVER THESE BEANS.

34:42.625 --> 34:46.708
FINE. YOU WANT
TO PLAY GAMES,
THAT'S JUST FINE.

34:46.708 --> 34:49.375
I'M REALLY NOT
THAT INTERESTED,
ANYWAY.

34:52.125 --> 34:53.833
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MOVE TO BOSTON?

34:53.833 --> 34:56.083
NOW WHAT KIND
OF NONSENSE
ARE YOU TALKING?

34:56.083 --> 35:00.458
NOTHING NONSENSICAL
HERE AT ALL.

35:00.458 --> 35:01.708
DEAD SERIOUS.

35:04.417 --> 35:05.458
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, JENNIFER.

35:05.458 --> 35:08.250
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.125
YOU HAVE A BIG,
BEAUTIFUL HEART, BUT...

35:11.125 --> 35:15.375
I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO DO THIS FOR ME.

35:15.375 --> 35:16.291
WELL, MAYBE
I'M DOING IT FOR ME.

35:19.542 --> 35:22.917
LOOK, MOVING TO BOSTON,
GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE,

35:22.917 --> 35:25.917
UM...IT SCARES ME.

35:25.917 --> 35:29.208
AND SOMEHOW, THE IDEA
OF HAVING YOU NEARBY,

35:29.208 --> 35:30.834
JUST TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE THERE,
WILL--YOU KNOW,

35:30.834 --> 35:34.792
IT SCARES ME LESS.
SO, BEFORE YOU START
WRITING SONNETS

35:34.792 --> 35:36.083
ABOUT MY BIG,
BEAUTIFUL HEART,

35:36.083 --> 35:39.875
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT I'M NOT
DOING THIS FOR YOU.

35:39.875 --> 35:42.291
I'M DOING THIS 'CAUSE
MY BIG, SELFISH HEART
WANTS YOU TO BE THERE.

35:42.291 --> 35:45.417
SO WILL YOU PLEASE
GO WITH ME?

35:47.125 --> 35:49.625
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S...

35:49.625 --> 35:52.375
SUCH AN OVERWHELMING
CONCEPT. I WOULDN'T
KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

35:52.375 --> 35:53.625
WELL, YOU START
BY CALLING MOVERS--

35:53.625 --> 35:55.750
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE,
JENNIFER. FIRST OF ALL,

35:55.750 --> 35:57.583
I WOULD HAVE TO FIND
A PLACE TO LIVE--

35:57.583 --> 35:58.708
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT

35:58.708 --> 36:00.166
TO FIND A PLACE AS NICE
AS LA BREA PARK.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.250
WELL, EVEN IF I COULD
FIND A SUITABLE HOME,

36:02.250 --> 36:03.125
WHAT WOULD I DO
IN BOSTON?

36:03.125 --> 36:05.959
HOW WOULD I
SPEND MY TIME?

36:05.959 --> 36:07.041
ANY WAY YOU LIKE.

36:07.041 --> 36:10.166
MAYBE A CHANGE
OF SCENERY
WOULD SERVE TO...

36:10.166 --> 36:12.500
INSPIRE YOU TO
TRY NEW THINGS.
MEET NEW PEOPLE.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.041
NO, I'M--I'M TOO OLD
FOR SUCH THINGS.

36:15.041 --> 36:17.041
PLEASE! YOU, WHO HAVE
SEEN MORE ACTION

36:17.041 --> 36:19.333
IN THE ROMANCE
DEPARTMENT
THAN I HAVE THIS YEAR.

36:20.792 --> 36:22.750
YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST
GRANDMA I KNOW.

36:22.750 --> 36:26.333
SO, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST QUIT IT WITH
THESE PITIFUL EXCUSES

36:26.333 --> 36:27.500
AND SAY YES?

36:36.708 --> 36:39.125
YOU'RE SURE I WOULDN'T
CRAMP YOUR STYLE?

36:39.125 --> 36:41.917
[CHUCKLES]
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

36:51.333 --> 36:54.000
SOMEHOW I KNEW
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

36:56.875 --> 36:59.250
I MEANT TO SNEAK BACK IN
BEFORE YOU WOKE UP.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.125
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN OUT HERE?

37:01.125 --> 37:06.125
UH...I DON'T KNOW.

37:06.125 --> 37:06.500
COUPLE HOURS, MAYBE.

37:09.458 --> 37:11.041
WATCHED THE SUN
COME UP THIS MORNING.

37:11.041 --> 37:12.125
I DON'T THINK I'VE
DONE THAT SINCE WE WERE

37:12.125 --> 37:14.291
SAILING AROUND
TOGETHER ON THE TRUE LOVE.

37:14.291 --> 37:17.500
WHICH...FEELS LIKE
A MILLION YEARS AGO,
DOESN'T IT?

37:17.875 --> 37:19.834
[SIGHS]

37:22.500 --> 37:24.208
HEY, PACE...

37:26.542 --> 37:28.166
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT DRAGGING YOU

37:28.166 --> 37:30.792
TO THAT PARTY
LAST NIGHT, AND...

37:30.792 --> 37:33.166
BRINGING BACK
ALL OF THOSE
BAD FEELINGS.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.208
[CLEARS THROAT]
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, JO.

37:37.291 --> 37:40.041
NONE OF THIS
IS YOUR FAULT.

37:40.041 --> 37:42.583
YOU'RE NOT THE REASON
THAT WE BROKE UP.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.166
BUT I THOUGHT
THAT YOU SAID--

37:47.166 --> 37:49.375
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

37:49.375 --> 37:52.208
AND I KNOW HOW I SAID IT,
AND IT MAKES ME
SICK TO MY STOMACH

37:52.208 --> 37:53.834
EVERY TIME
I THINK ABOUT IT.

37:53.834 --> 37:57.417
BLAMING YOU FOR MY
INSECURITIES AND...

37:57.417 --> 38:00.291
THEN MAKING YOU FEEL
GUILTY FOR ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED,

38:00.291 --> 38:02.875
WHEN YOU SHOULD FEEL
NOTHING BUT PROUD.

38:04.750 --> 38:05.500
AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

38:10.333 --> 38:11.708
I KNOW YOU ARE.

38:11.708 --> 38:14.667
BUT I DIDN'T
SHOW YOU THAT.

38:14.667 --> 38:15.875
INSTEAD--
[CLEARS THROAT]

38:15.875 --> 38:18.500
INSTEAD,
I DECIDED TO BECOME
A STEREOTYPICAL GUY

38:18.500 --> 38:20.083
WHO CAN'T HANDLE IT
WHEN HIS GIRLFRIEND

38:20.083 --> 38:22.083
GETS A BETTER JOB
THAN HE DOES.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.542
I HATE THAT GUY.

38:25.542 --> 38:27.500
PACEY, YOU'RE NOT
THAT GUY.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.959
I FEEL LIKE THAT GUY.

38:31.625 --> 38:34.250
BECAUSE AS MUCH
AS I WANT NOT TO CARE,

38:34.250 --> 38:37.667
AND AS MUCH AS I WISH
THAT I COULD JUST LET IT
ROLL OFF OF MY BACK, I CAN'T.

38:39.166 --> 38:43.208
WHEN WE WERE AT THE PARTY
TOGETHER LAST NIGHT, JO,
I WAS JEALOUS.

38:43.208 --> 38:45.625
I WASN'T JEALOUS OF YOU,
BUT I WAS CERTAINLY JEALOUS
OF THE REST OF THE KIDS

38:45.625 --> 38:49.834
WHO WERE GONNA GET
TO EXPERIENCE YOU NEXT YEAR.

38:49.834 --> 38:52.458
'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA
GET TO BE WITH YOU,
AND I'M NOT.

38:55.792 --> 38:58.250
AND I WAS SO CERTAIN
THAT KUBELIK'S OFFER

38:58.250 --> 39:00.750
WAS GONNA BE
THE ANSWER TO ALL
OF OUR PROBLEMS.

39:01.375 --> 39:03.208
A SIGN, YOU KNOW?

39:03.208 --> 39:07.166
YEAH. I KNOW.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.834
I KNOW, AND I THINK
THAT IT WAS A SIGN.

39:08.834 --> 39:10.875
JUST NOT THE ONE
THAT WE WERE HOPING FOR.

39:13.834 --> 39:18.291
BUT AT LEAST WE GOT
A BETTER ENDING THIS TIME.

39:19.708 --> 39:21.333
I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

39:31.792 --> 39:33.000
