10:59.659 --> 11:01.828
staying at attention.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.663
You know what I mean?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.540
I do know
what you mean,

11:05.540 --> 11:07.208
but I'm proud of you
anyway.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.836
Where'd you find her?
It's not important.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.504
I didn't catch
that name.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.506
Who was this again?

11:13.506 --> 11:14.507
It was Lyla.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.675
Come on.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.676
No!

11:16.676 --> 11:19.012
Boo!
Uh‐uh!

11:19.012 --> 11:21.014
What‐‐
what are you sayin' to me?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.016
Well, of course
your ding dong went soft.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.642
It was tryin'
to protect you.
I know, I know.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.520
All right, it wasn't,
like, my proudest moment,

11:27.520 --> 11:30.023
but, you know, if you'd
hold back on the judgment

11:30.023 --> 11:31.858
just a little bit right now,
that'd be great.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.693
'Cause this is really
helping me right now.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.612
I know what you want.
I know what you want.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.530
You wanna grab her
and do her, huh?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.532
Make her forget about
that other guy, right?
Yes.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.201
Just bang
the bejesus out of her.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.494
Exactly.
That's exactly what I wanna do.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.871
Yeah.
Not gonna happen.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.664
Least not for a while,
anyway.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.629
Why not?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.714
Dude, you're like
a newborn baby.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.716
You don't know how
to do anything.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.719
Look, man, whatever
worked for you before

11:59.719 --> 12:01.721
may not work now,
you know?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.891
You just gotta figure out
what turns you on, you know?

12:04.891 --> 12:07.727
Like, will I ever
be able to‐‐

12:07.727 --> 12:09.020
What, shoot fireworks?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.730
Yeah.
Have a super happy
fun time?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.564
Yeah.
Yes.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.108
Probably.
Just maybe not every time.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.071
Look,

12:18.071 --> 12:21.741
nothing's like it was,
you know?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.244
But don't look
so glum, man.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.205
There's more to life
than hit it and quit it, QB,

12:27.247 --> 12:28.248
trust me.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.002
[chuckling]

12:33.920 --> 12:34.921
(Tami)
Landry.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.714
Landry.
Hi.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.675
How you doing?

12:38.716 --> 12:39.717
Good.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.468
Do you know
Tim Riggins?

12:40.510 --> 12:42.053
He's lookin' for
an English tutor,

12:42.095 --> 12:44.097
and I think you would
be just perfect.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.598
Do you?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.767
Yeah, I do, and I just
want you to know

12:47.767 --> 12:50.228
that he wants to really
improve his grades.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.105
He's looking
to expand his mind.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.731
Don't go easy on him.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.233
Spend as much time
as you need.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.610
Do whatever you need to do,
and y'all get in there

12:57.610 --> 12:59.028
and get it goin'.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.780
And I think you'll be great.
Thanks, Landry.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.781
Okay, um‐‐

13:01.781 --> 13:03.700
Good luck.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.118
Okay.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.744
[whistle blows]

13:07.787 --> 13:09.289
Go!

13:13.293 --> 13:14.752
Set!

13:15.795 --> 13:17.088
Hut!

13:20.133 --> 13:21.718
(Taylor)
There it is.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.136
That's nice, Matt.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.220
That's nice.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.601
Set.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.978
(Crowley)
Coach Taylor,
you seen this?

13:31.978 --> 13:33.229
Huh?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.814
Texas Football magazine.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.650
Top ten high school coaches
in the state of Texas.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.652
You're on this list.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.320
Right there, Coach.
Oh, there's no livin'
with him now.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.782
Better watch what you say.
Says "up and coming."

13:44.824 --> 13:46.325
How 'bout that?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.619
(Crowley)
Coach, we're getting T‐shirts
with that on it.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.663
It'll be on the radio.
(McGill)
Sweaters.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.373
That's a three‐minute break.
Three minutes.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.374
Let's go!

13:53.374 --> 13:54.834
[whistle blows]

13:57.295 --> 13:59.005
Hey, Dad.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.757
Lookin' good, Matt.
Thanks.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.009
I think I'm gonna take off.
I got some sleep to catch up on.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.011
Wait, can you hold on
a minute?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.013
I want you to meet the coach.
Hey, come here, come here.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.806
This is my dad.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.183
Coach!

14:10.183 --> 14:11.684
Yeah.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.145
Uh, this is my dad,
Henry Saracen.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.022
This is Coach Taylor.
This is my dad.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.857
How do you do?
Pleasure to meet you.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.858
(Taylor)
Pleasure to meet you.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.860
You're, uh,
you're on leave?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.029
Yeah, he's home
for two weeks.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.822
That's good‐‐you gonna get to
see your son play a little bit?
I hope so.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.617
He's done a hell of a job
leading this team, I tell you.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.826
Not too much trouble
from him, huh?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.162
He's a little bit of trouble.
He's not too much trouble.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.914
A little bit of trouble,
huh? He's gotta be.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.916
He's been a pleasure to teach,
I can tell you that.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.794
I didn't know
he had it in him.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.338
(Taylor)
He's got plenty in him.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.173
He's been a good team leader
out here.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.634
I'll tell you what.
You can be proud of your son.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.052
Just hope he keeps doin'
okay under pressure.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.678
(Taylor)
You betcha.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.889
Well, I gotta run, Coach.
I'll talk to you later.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.057
It was a pleasure
to meet you.
Very nice meeting you.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.725
I'll see you
at home, Son.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.060
Yeah, I'll see you
at home, Dad.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.895
Thanks‐‐thanks, Coach.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.988
You betcha.
Get something to drink now.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.905
He's probably just
having a hard time

15:05.905 --> 15:07.865
trying to express himself.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.825
Yeah, maybe.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.243
You know what it is?

15:10.284 --> 15:12.537
He's probably all messed up
from the war.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.788
That's exactly what it is‐‐
he's gone war crazy

15:13.830 --> 15:15.790
from the, you know, Operation
Freedom flashbacks and stuff.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.917
He's not war crazy.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.877
He's just‐‐

15:19.919 --> 15:21.379
He‐‐he should see you play.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.755
I mean, if you get him
to one of the games,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.674
he'll understand
what all of the fuss is about.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.760
Yeah, I guess.
Maybe.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.930
Is he gonna help you get some
in‐home care for your grandma?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.891
Well, yeah, he's gonna
straighten all that out.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.560
I mean, really, this was,
like, a perfect time

15:35.601 --> 15:36.769
for him to come home

15:36.811 --> 15:37.770
because, clearly,
I can't get it done.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.272
(Landry)
You know what, Matty?

15:39.313 --> 15:40.731
I think what he needs

15:40.773 --> 15:43.568
is to come and see...

15:43.609 --> 15:45.903
my new band,
Crucifictorious!

15:45.945 --> 15:48.865
Anyone?
Broken Spoke.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.950
This Friday
after the game.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.785
Doors open at 11:00‐‐you gotta
get there early, though.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.953
It's gonna be pretty packed.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.746
We have to go
to that, don't we?

15:55.788 --> 15:56.914
Well, if we don't go,

15:56.956 --> 15:59.000
I don't really think anyone
else is gonna be there, so‐‐

16:02.336 --> 16:03.921
[knock on door]

16:03.963 --> 16:05.006
Yep.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.467
Hi.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.927
Hey.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.889
[TV plays]

16:12.930 --> 16:14.640
Guess what I have.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.808
What?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.936
Dirty, dirty,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.605
dirty

16:20.646 --> 16:22.940
quad porn.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.483
What?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.985
(woman)
Before you engage

16:25.985 --> 16:28.321
in any sexual activity
with a partner,

16:28.321 --> 16:30.823
it will be helpful to know
how your new body works.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.951
This can most effectively
be done by masturbation.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.996
Listen, Lyla, can we just shut
this off and talk for a few‐‐
No.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.665
I know it's not exactly
the porn you were expecting,

16:39.707 --> 16:41.709
but there's some
useful stuff in here.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.668
Keeping an open mind

16:42.668 --> 16:45.504
and using your imagination
in the wheelchair

16:45.546 --> 16:48.633
can allow for spontaneity
and pleasure

16:48.674 --> 16:49.759
in sexual activity.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.843
Enjoy yourself.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.763
I wasn't expecting
any porn.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.890
No, Jason, wait!

16:57.141 --> 16:59.477
Listen,
I know this is weird,

16:59.518 --> 17:00.978
but we can
get through this.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.813
That's not what I'm‐‐

17:02.855 --> 17:03.940
I think we were
really close before.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.650
It's not about sex.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.611
And a lot of couples
have very good luck

17:08.653 --> 17:10.029
in the shower.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.865
You wanna get laid
that bad, call Riggins.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.538
(Landry)
You know what?

17:19.580 --> 17:21.082
I don't know
about you, Tim,

17:21.123 --> 17:24.043
but I am excited
about your new journey

17:24.043 --> 17:26.379
into the wonderful world
of American literature.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.588
I really, really am.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.550
What do you think of the name
Crucifictorious?

17:30.550 --> 17:33.010
I wanted to go with
Stigmatalingus,

17:33.052 --> 17:35.471
but I, uh, got outvoted.
They're both crap, Landry.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.847
I mean, that's great.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.765
You are entitled
to your opinion.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.976
That's just what makes
America so great.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.978
Just being honest.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.564
Okay, Of Mice and Men.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.566
The good news is it's a short
book‐‐it's a hundred pages,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.734
so you can pretty much
rock it out in one night.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.486
Right on that.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.865
Oh, my God,
you can't read, can you?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.075
Is that it?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.536
You're one of those kids who
just slipped through the cracks?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.705
I can read, you joke.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.623
I just choose not to.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.709
That's cute.
That's real cute.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.590
(Landry)
I got a show
y'all might wanna come to.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.508
(Saracen)
Still like it
almost burnt?

18:12.550 --> 18:13.593
Yes, sir.
There you go.

18:13.634 --> 18:14.677
Look at that.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.429
It's good, Matthew.
Thanks.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.556
Beats the hell out of
them MREs.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.308
[tapping fork]

18:20.349 --> 18:22.059
(Mrs. Saracen)
Is that one done?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.102
Oh, yeah, it's done.

18:23.144 --> 18:27.940
[continues tapping]

18:27.940 --> 18:30.026
Relax.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.236
What is she
so nervous for?

18:32.278 --> 18:35.072
She's always like this‐‐that's
what I was trying to tell you.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.742
That's why I wanna try
and get a nurse in here

18:37.783 --> 18:39.035
or something like that.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.745
[tapping]
I'm not nervous.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.996
I‐‐I know.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.832
So, what's it, um,

18:44.874 --> 18:47.752
wh‐what's it like
over there in Iraq?

18:47.793 --> 18:49.128
Good.
Building schools.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.630
Doing a lot of good.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.923
Yeah, so when do you think
it's gonna be over?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.593
When do you think you can
come home for‐‐for good?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.720
I tell you this‐‐
we're not gonna leave

18:57.762 --> 18:59.722
until those people
have a stable government.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.974
You know, uh,

19:01.974 --> 19:04.727
there's some people
who think that we should just,

19:04.769 --> 19:07.563
you know, get everybody
out of there and come home.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.939
Do you know what would
happen if we left?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.108
How many innocent
people would die?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.903
We're gonna stay until we
finish what we started, Matt.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.614
Well, I'm not really saying‐‐
I wasn't saying anything.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.825
I just, you know, I just
like it when you're home.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.124
[horn honks]

19:28.876 --> 19:29.960
Hey, I got you.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.796
No, I got it.
Come on, now.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.005
I already dragged
the other one out here.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.924
I can drag
this one out too.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.134
You're gonna do the last 3 feet
and take all the credit for it?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.095
I'm not gonna give you
the credit now.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.137
I got the other one out‐‐
Hey‐‐

19:43.182 --> 19:45.184
[laughs]

19:45.184 --> 19:47.645
I can't believe
you just did that.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.147
I didn't do anything.
Look at that!

19:50.189 --> 19:51.982
Come on, just‐‐
That's a disaster.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.693
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.111
Let me ask you something.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.196
Did you, by chance,
make it your personal mission

19:57.196 --> 19:59.949
to take over the education
of Tim Riggins?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.033
I am, actually, yes.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.827
You know, I found out

20:02.868 --> 20:04.870
that he's been having
the Rally Girls do his homework

20:04.870 --> 20:07.039
for I don't know how long.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.916
That's very nice of you,
but we both are aware

20:08.958 --> 20:11.043
of the no pass,
no play policy.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.878
Yeah, I'm very aware
of that, mm‐hmm.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.796
And if you would
just think about this...

20:13.838 --> 20:15.715
I know that
you're not about to say...

20:15.756 --> 20:16.716
if just for
the next couple games.

20:16.757 --> 20:17.758
what I think
you're about to say,

20:17.800 --> 20:18.676
because you know what
the answer is gonna be.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.553
Baby, we've got
a chance at the playoffs.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.887
'Cause you know what?
He's been cheatin',

20:21.887 --> 20:23.556
honey, and I don't
even want to ask you

20:23.556 --> 20:24.557
if you knew that
he's been cheating.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.641
But he's been cheating,

20:25.683 --> 20:27.017
and I know you don't want me
to turn my back on that.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.686
No, I didn't know
he was cheating,

20:28.728 --> 20:31.063
and I know how important
the kid's schooling is.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.982
What I'm saying is that
the next couple of games‐‐

20:33.023 --> 20:34.859
Do you, though? You think
it's as important as winning?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.068
I mean, really, do you?

20:36.110 --> 20:37.278
You're really asking me
that question?

20:37.319 --> 20:39.363
You're asking me that question?
Can you answer the question?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.198
No, I can't answer
the question,

20:41.240 --> 20:42.867
because you won't
let me finish talking.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.784
Well, you know what,

20:43.826 --> 20:45.703
it does not do Tim Riggins
a bit of good

20:45.745 --> 20:47.580
to grow up ignorant
and mean and dumb.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.664
What are you talking about?

20:48.706 --> 20:49.582
That's what you are encouraging
with these boys.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.250
I'm not encouraging that.
Yes, you are!

20:51.292 --> 20:53.085
I know how important
his education is.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.378
No, you're making 'em
feel like

20:54.420 --> 20:56.005
what this town
makes 'em feel like,

20:56.046 --> 20:57.923
which is that football
is the most important thing.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.718
If we send that message to him,
that's what he's gonna believe.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.094
You've gotta be
kidding me.
No, I'm not.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.721
You gotta be kidding me.
I'm not kidding you.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.181
You know I'm not
kidding you.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.224
[cell phone rings]
I can't believe that we're
even disagreeing about this.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.727
I can't believe you're even
asking me to do that.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.853
Hello.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.104
Coach Taylor.

21:12.146 --> 21:12.897
Yeah.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.231
I'll get the rest
of the garbage.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.276
Hey, Coach.
Yes, sir.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.159
Well, I mean, I can't make
any commitments, obviously‐‐

21:29.121 --> 21:30.998
Well, sure.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.083
All right, well, I'll look
forward to your call.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.253
You can consider the
conversation open, of course.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.964
All right, you too.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.966
Thanks, Coach.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.138
What?
Who was that?

21:49.850 --> 21:52.144
That was the assistant coach
from over at UT.

21:52.144 --> 21:56.315
They wanted to know
if I had any interest

21:56.357 --> 21:58.859
in quarterback coach
next season.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.111
Uh‐uh.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.657
That's what the man said.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.075
Nuh‐uh.
Really?

22:06.116 --> 22:08.327
Get outta here!

22:08.327 --> 22:09.995
You're full of it!
Really?

22:10.037 --> 22:11.632
Really?
Yep.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.752
(Landry)
Hey, Riggins.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.338
Hey, Riggins,

22:19.338 --> 22:20.923
when do you
want to get together

22:20.965 --> 22:22.591
and work on that
book report?

22:22.633 --> 22:24.760
Oh, man,
I haven't read that.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.011
Why have you not
read it?

22:26.053 --> 22:28.097
I don't know.
I didn't get around to it.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.140
Okay, just checking.
That's great.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.812
Um, you know if you don't pass,
you don't play, right?

22:34.854 --> 22:35.688
What do you want me to do?

22:35.688 --> 22:36.689
You want me to read it
to you myself?

22:36.689 --> 22:40.985
"A few miles south of Soledad,
the Salinas River

22:41.026 --> 22:42.862
"drops in close
to the hillside bank

22:42.903 --> 22:45.030
"and runs deep and green.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.533
"The water is warm, too,
for it has slipped twinkling

22:47.533 --> 22:49.118
"over the yellow sands
in the sunlight

22:49.159 --> 22:50.828
before reaching
the narrow pool."

22:50.870 --> 22:53.455
What did I just say
just now?

22:55.082 --> 22:57.376
I don't know‐‐some stuff
about a river.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.670
Okay, well, what did this
river look like?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.797
It's real pretty, Landry.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.384
Okay.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.469
"On one side
of the river"‐‐

23:07.511 --> 23:09.722
What the hell is Riggins
doin' in there?

23:09.722 --> 23:12.641
Studying.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.186
Hey, Dad.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.730
What, uh‐‐

23:17.771 --> 23:18.731
what are you doing?

23:18.772 --> 23:20.566
Your grandma's
driving me crazy.

23:20.608 --> 23:21.859
I had to get out
of the house.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.737
She can be a little much
sometimes.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.572
Why didn't you tell me
how bad it was?

23:26.572 --> 23:28.115
Well, it's not that bad‐‐
[alarm beeps]

23:29.783 --> 23:30.868
Grandma!

23:32.703 --> 23:33.829
Grandma!

23:35.122 --> 23:36.081
Grandma!
Huh?

23:36.123 --> 23:37.583
Grandma, you all right?

23:37.625 --> 23:38.542
You gotta be
kidding me.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.003
What did I tell you
about using the stove?

23:41.045 --> 23:43.756
What is wrong with you?
You're acting like a damn child!

23:43.756 --> 23:45.549
Dad, calm down.
It was an accident.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.676
I told you three times
to lay away from the stove!

23:47.718 --> 23:48.928
Dad, don't yell at her.
You're just gonna scare her.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.846
You okay?
No, no, no.
[sniffling]

23:50.888 --> 23:51.764
Don't cry, it's okay.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.432
I don't even know
what happened, honey.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.516
Why is he mad at me?

23:54.558 --> 23:56.018
He's not.
He's just scared.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.102
All right?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.063
We were all just scared,
all right?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.606
What happened?

24:00.606 --> 24:02.191
It's all right.
It's all over, okay?

24:02.232 --> 24:04.526
You all right?

24:04.568 --> 24:06.612
It's not your fault,
okay?

24:09.239 --> 24:12.618
The Medicare is not gonna
pay for at‐home care

24:12.660 --> 24:14.870
unless she has a definitive
diagnosis of Alzheimer's.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.748
Well, let's get her
a diagnosis, then.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.087
What about a home?
What?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.756
My veterans' benefits
should cover that.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.591
(woman)
Yeah, there's some
homes in the area.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.259
But she's Matt's
legal guardian.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.804
If she's in a home,
that's not gonna work.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.765
There's another option.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.768
Mr. Saracen, you might be able
to get out of your service

24:37.810 --> 24:38.894
if there's no one else
to look‐‐

24:38.936 --> 24:40.229
No, I can't do that.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.605
What?
Why not?

24:41.647 --> 24:42.815
That‐‐
that would be perfect.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.817
It's out of the question, Matt.
We're not done over there yet.

24:44.817 --> 24:45.693
But, Dad, it's grandma‐‐

24:45.734 --> 24:47.903
I'm not gonna argue
about it with you.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.780
We all have to make
sacrifices.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.948
I know, I underst‐‐

24:50.990 --> 24:52.032
Stop, Matt.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.243
Thank you.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.161
I think
we've heard enough here.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.959
(Landry)
"Slim said, 'You hadda, George.
I swear you hadda.

25:01.959 --> 25:02.918
"Come on with me.'

25:02.960 --> 25:05.004
"He led George to the
entrance of the trail

25:05.004 --> 25:06.046
"and up toward the highway.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.840
"Curley and Carlson
looked after them,

25:07.881 --> 25:09.633
"and Carlson said,

25:09.675 --> 25:12.845
'What the hell you suppose
is eatin' them two guys?'"

25:15.014 --> 25:17.850
Damn.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.853
The guy shot
his best friend.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.938
Intense.

25:24.189 --> 25:27.693
Now he's become the kind of man
he said he never wanted to be.

25:27.735 --> 25:28.819
Exactly.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.154
I gotcha.
Exactly.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.031
Without Lennie, George
lost all his humanity.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.824
Yeah, that's messed up.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.036
Okay, so oral report.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.205
All right, first, you give
a brief plot summary,

25:40.247 --> 25:43.709
and then you list the themes
and how they relate to you.

25:43.751 --> 25:46.879
So how do they
relate to you?

25:48.005 --> 25:49.214
Go.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.675
I don't know.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.177
You don't‐‐
[laughs]

25:53.218 --> 25:55.679
Okay, we just got done
discussing this whole thing.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.806
That was talking.
This is different.

25:57.848 --> 26:00.350
How is this different?
This is the same exact thing.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.226
Just tell me what you‐‐

26:01.268 --> 26:03.979
Seriously, what do you
want me to say?

26:04.021 --> 26:06.023
You know, why don't you
just do it for me?

26:06.065 --> 26:08.567
Just do it for you?
Yeah.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.985
No, I'm not gonna
just do it for you.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.111
I mean‐‐
[stammers]

26:12.237 --> 26:13.906
My God, you really
are ridiculous.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.991
Do you just have the Rally
Girls do everything for you?

26:16.033 --> 26:17.576
I mean, do they
just chew your food

26:17.618 --> 26:20.245
and wipe your butt for you‐‐
how does this work?

26:20.287 --> 26:22.956
I just sat here
and read the entire‐‐

26:22.998 --> 26:24.958
the entire book to you,

26:24.958 --> 26:26.251
and you have nothing to say.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.253
There's gotta be something
in this head of yours

26:28.295 --> 26:29.254
that you can relate to.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.714
I don't know.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.091
There's gotta be something!
I don't know.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.593
What don't you know?
Okay, listen‐‐listen.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.929
Okay, this‐‐this is a book

26:36.929 --> 26:38.847
about two best friends

26:38.889 --> 26:41.600
who have a dream
that gets crushed.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.894
They have a dream
that gets crushed.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.355
You can't tell me that
there's not something

26:46.396 --> 26:48.398
in this head of yours
that you can relate this to.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.900
There's gotta be something!

26:49.942 --> 26:51.610
My Go‐‐

26:51.652 --> 26:54.404
You know, here's an example
how I can relate to this.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.950
I would really, really
like to shoot you right now.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.618
Okay, so you know what?

26:59.660 --> 27:00.619
Just take the book,
and I'm done.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.122
You can figure it out
on your own from here.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.335
[doorbell rings]

27:10.838 --> 27:11.755
Jason.
Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.091
How are you, honey?
I'm good, I'm good.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.426
Um, how are you?
I'm good.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.428
Did you wheel yourself
all the way over here?

27:18.470 --> 27:19.805
Yeah, I did.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.432
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.893
Oh, my‐‐well,
did you want to see Coach?

27:24.935 --> 27:26.895
He's not here.
He's at a meeting.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.439
And then we got
this church dinner.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.441
Um, well, you know what?
Come on inside.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.945
You know what?
I was just thinking about you.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.447
I was just thinking about
when you might

27:37.489 --> 27:40.158
feel like you're ready
to go back to school.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.995
I, uh,

27:42.995 --> 27:45.372
I haven't really

That's great.

38:54.702 --> 38:56.829
You can't just
stand there, though.

38:56.871 --> 38:59.499
You gotta‐‐
You gotta do that a lot.

39:17.684 --> 39:19.852
(Street)
You're incredibly stealthy.

39:19.894 --> 39:21.396
[giggles]

39:21.396 --> 39:24.399
You could be like
a glamorous jewel thief.
Shut up.

39:24.399 --> 39:26.859
You could go into breaking
and entering for a living.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.450
What are you
doing here, Lyla?

39:34.450 --> 39:36.869
Can't seem to kick
the habit.

39:36.911 --> 39:37.870
[laughs]

39:51.926 --> 39:54.178
If it's gonna end
between us,

39:54.220 --> 39:57.432
I guess
I can't help that.

39:57.432 --> 40:00.184
But...

40:00.226 --> 40:03.229
it can't end the way
it did the other night.

40:07.442 --> 40:10.695
I just wanted to be close
to you again, Jason.

40:11.738 --> 40:14.198
I'm trying, Lyla.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.285
I really am.

40:25.460 --> 40:28.254
I love you.

40:29.631 --> 40:31.758
I know.

40:37.263 --> 40:38.806
(Tami)
Hey.

40:38.806 --> 40:41.517
What are you doing?

40:44.646 --> 40:47.273
I just don't
want him to go.

40:51.986 --> 40:55.281
Come on.
Let's get ready for bed.

40:58.034 --> 41:00.620
That's it.

41:00.662 --> 41:03.831
Grandma's going into a home,
and I'm going to Oklahoma.

41:03.831 --> 41:06.292
Do you want me
to talk to him?

41:06.334 --> 41:09.587
I'll talk to him, see if
we can work something out.

41:10.838 --> 41:13.466
Nothing to work out.

41:13.508 --> 41:15.677
Listen to me.
We're all family here.

41:15.677 --> 41:18.971
I'll do anything I can for you.
You know that.

41:19.013 --> 41:20.306
Hell, Buddy Garrity,

41:20.348 --> 41:22.517
he ain't gonna let you
cross the state line

41:22.517 --> 41:23.976
without finishing
this season.

41:24.018 --> 41:26.312
He'll call out the damn
national guard if he has to.

41:28.022 --> 41:29.816
I hate him.

41:31.359 --> 41:33.403
I hate my dad.

41:35.530 --> 41:38.533
Hey, don't do that.

41:38.533 --> 41:40.868
Don't make that mistake.

41:42.704 --> 41:44.038
You think about
what you just said.

41:44.038 --> 41:45.456
You get ready to go,
come inside.

41:45.498 --> 41:46.958
I'll take you home.

42:42.430 --> 43:25.014
