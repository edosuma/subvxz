01:18.609 --> 01:20.649
This way, Don Pietro.

01:54.243 --> 01:55.811
Don Pietro,

01:56.175 --> 01:58.084
please forgive me,

01:58.399 --> 02:00.730
I have some bad news.

02:01.604 --> 02:03.782
Genny's been shot.

02:06.791 --> 02:09.282
His men too,

02:09.366 --> 02:11.408
they're in real bad shape.

02:25.691 --> 02:28.808
Don Pietro, get a little rest.

02:29.556 --> 02:33.027
I've rested way too long, Malamore.

02:51.022 --> 02:53.088
What happened?

02:53.558 --> 02:55.935
I wanted a dead man, you
gave me an enemy for life.

02:55.982 --> 02:59.344
He took three
bullets, one right here.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.424
If he's not dead, he will be soon.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.269
Let's hope so.

03:04.345 --> 03:06.407
Because his father busted out.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.234
I heard it on the radio.

03:08.301 --> 03:12.043
We need to works fast, Salvatore,
we gotta take it all.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.203
The ones against Gennaro
have to stay with us

03:15.271 --> 03:18.341
and those on the fence
gotta come to our side.

03:19.129 --> 03:21.494
Let's call a meeting,

03:21.589 --> 03:24.648
all the families with
dealing spots send a guy,

03:24.735 --> 03:27.149
even the ones working for Savastano,

03:27.213 --> 03:30.040
even friends and relatives
of the ones Gennaro killed.

03:30.108 --> 03:33.163
We overturn things,
they'll all side with us

03:33.218 --> 03:35.931
and we do what we always promised:

03:36.014 --> 03:37.887
you bring the stuff

03:37.932 --> 03:41.295
and we each handle a spot,
but autonomously!

03:43.296 --> 03:45.315
Salvatore,

03:46.564 --> 03:48.749
let's make an alliance.

04:09.936 --> 04:12.148
What's in it for me?

04:14.208 --> 04:17.096
You get back what was yours...

04:19.262 --> 04:23.516
what you had before Spain,
your own home,

04:25.075 --> 04:27.542
but you're back as master.

04:33.456 --> 04:35.312
Okay.

04:36.372 --> 04:39.300
The ones that bring cash
get a spot,

04:40.768 --> 04:44.722
before a busted-out Savastano
or a resurrected Savastano

04:44.777 --> 04:46.922
comes fucking around.

04:49.727 --> 04:51.504
Got it.

05:21.052 --> 05:22.677
No, sweetheart,

05:22.977 --> 05:25.888
stop crying, it's all over.

05:32.297 --> 05:34.100
Where is she?

05:35.805 --> 05:37.967
Stop crying, alright?

05:54.672 --> 05:57.952
Can you wash you own hands? Good.

05:58.146 --> 06:00.157
Here's the soap.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.528
Wash them, then dry them
with this, okay?

06:07.871 --> 06:09.417
Ciro...

06:12.107 --> 06:15.307
- We have to talk.
- Not right now.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.928
- They're coming to kill us.
- No one's coming.

06:19.777 --> 06:23.055
You killed his wife and shot his son,
you broke all the rules,

06:23.121 --> 06:25.228
now they'll kill me and Maria Rita.

06:25.328 --> 06:27.637
He's hiding and can't move.

06:27.717 --> 06:29.249
They'll find someone.

06:29.296 --> 06:32.559
They've been kings for 30 years,
think they can't find someone?

06:32.923 --> 06:34.515
- 50, 60...
- Do you hear me?

06:37.018 --> 06:39.054
We have to leave!

06:39.213 --> 06:41.196
Don't worry, Debora.

06:41.350 --> 06:43.406
- We have to leave.
- Don't worry!

07:04.501 --> 07:08.141
You know how much I've put aside
all these years?

07:10.599 --> 07:12.764
60 thousand euros...

07:14.722 --> 07:16.463
peanuts!

07:16.562 --> 07:18.720
I don't even have that!

07:22.201 --> 07:24.784
We have to take a spot, Rosario.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.779
We gotta find the money.

07:29.846 --> 07:32.342
We gotta find it now.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.464
Get out! Get out!

08:02.531 --> 08:04.639
I'll kill you, get out!

08:06.175 --> 08:08.751
- Throw the gun on the ground.
- Put it down.

08:08.816 --> 08:11.710
- We got nothing...
- I said: gun down.

08:12.899 --> 08:14.604
Hands up.

08:14.646 --> 08:18.026
We just left the depot,
there's no money.

08:18.389 --> 08:20.209
Strip.

08:21.021 --> 08:23.430
- Why?
- I said: strip!

08:25.107 --> 08:26.715
Move!

09:46.481 --> 09:48.944
Look, I know where you live,

09:50.104 --> 09:52.559
where your kids go to school.

09:53.405 --> 09:55.258
I know everything.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.561
Don't fuck around.

10:06.571 --> 10:09.799
- Good evening, Salvatore.
- Evening, guys.

10:11.995 --> 10:14.365
Coffee, guys?

10:14.462 --> 10:16.592
No, thanks, just be a minute.

10:17.536 --> 10:19.832
Not even you, Luciano?

10:21.958 --> 10:23.775
Luciano!

10:23.872 --> 10:26.746
It's not Luciano, he's a new guy.

10:42.188 --> 10:44.449
This new guy's got no voice?

10:46.984 --> 10:49.531
- Why the fuck...?
- Shut up, asshole!

10:51.233 --> 10:52.749
Move!

11:03.041 --> 11:05.851
Out that way, move!

11:11.589 --> 11:13.780
Don't hurt me!

11:16.232 --> 11:19.645
Take those out of there, fast!

11:29.525 --> 11:31.925
- Move!
- Right away!

11:34.083 --> 11:36.357
Get out, make it fast.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.760
Move it!

12:54.784 --> 12:58.088
Maria Rita, take it up higher!

12:58.956 --> 13:00.979
Go on, a little higher!

13:03.400 --> 13:05.251
Good girl!

13:06.874 --> 13:08.989
Don't let it fall.

13:46.584 --> 13:49.182
The police called me.

13:53.373 --> 13:56.186
I've been summoned
with the other parents.

14:00.696 --> 14:02.697
Do I go?

14:04.440 --> 14:06.677
It's worse if I don't, isn't it?

14:11.266 --> 14:13.956
But tell them I wasn't in Naples.

14:14.935 --> 14:17.627
I didn't even see the recital,

14:18.304 --> 14:20.277
okay?

14:20.433 --> 14:22.490
I'll deal with it.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.188
Ciro, I can't take anymore.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.761
Maria Rita can't even go to school!
Till when?

14:31.195 --> 14:32.888
When does it end?

14:32.982 --> 14:34.717
Do you see her?

14:35.085 --> 14:38.078
See her? Look how pretty she is!

14:39.015 --> 14:41.769
She's already over it, all forgotten.

14:45.073 --> 14:47.428
Why don't you do like her?

14:48.436 --> 14:50.977
Just think it's all over,

14:51.053 --> 14:53.349
because it really is all over.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.686
Now I'll get the cops off my back

14:59.935 --> 15:01.522
and then we can relax.

15:21.611 --> 15:24.894
Someone saw a man leave the theater.

15:31.876 --> 15:33.606
More or less like this.

15:34.814 --> 15:37.645
Looks like your husband,
don't you think?

15:42.829 --> 15:44.484
Your husband was there.

15:47.194 --> 15:50.558
- And who says so?
- I do.

15:50.735 --> 15:54.039
Just because someone saw
a bald man outside the theater.

15:55.668 --> 15:57.599
They know him here at school,

15:57.721 --> 16:00.963
if he'd been there,
some parent would have said so,

16:01.085 --> 16:02.557
get it?

16:07.524 --> 16:09.798
Mrs. Di Marzio,

16:09.846 --> 16:12.618
you're defending yourself
from the wrong people.

16:12.769 --> 16:14.830
I hope you realize that in time.

16:16.862 --> 16:18.747
Good day.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.413
This is an advance.

17:11.492 --> 17:13.656
Then I'll give you 6 thousand euros

17:14.050 --> 17:16.200
at the end of each month.

17:20.269 --> 17:22.490
You can sort out everything.

17:26.660 --> 17:29.942
Your wife, your kids,

17:30.719 --> 17:33.097
will have no more worries.

17:35.062 --> 17:38.387
And when you get out,
there'll be money

17:38.438 --> 17:40.671
to start over.

17:45.121 --> 17:48.288
It's the chance to change your life.

17:51.764 --> 17:53.599
Think about it.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.179
Good day, ma'am.

18:40.289 --> 18:43.874
What is it, brother? Did I scare you?

18:44.966 --> 18:46.892
I didn't recognize you.

18:46.986 --> 18:48.512
Now do you?

18:48.564 --> 18:50.311
Why are you shaking?

18:50.363 --> 18:52.114
What is it?

18:53.383 --> 18:55.373
We can't be seen together,

18:56.001 --> 18:59.530
if they find out I was in with you,
I'm a dead man.

18:59.619 --> 19:02.318
Don't worry, they won't find out.

19:02.758 --> 19:05.277
But you have to do
something else for me.

19:12.090 --> 19:14.328
I saw who took the shot.

19:22.733 --> 19:25.316
What took you so long to come?

19:28.521 --> 19:30.842
I was afraid.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.830
Let's hear it!

20:53.421 --> 20:54.930
Don't worry.

20:57.706 --> 20:59.683
Capiano, open up!

20:59.687 --> 21:01.224
Police!

21:02.970 --> 21:04.667
Capiano!

21:08.922 --> 21:10.786
Open, police!

21:12.814 --> 21:14.637
Capiano!

21:16.968 --> 21:18.548
Open up!

21:21.522 --> 21:23.230
- Antonio Capiano?
- It's me.

21:23.264 --> 21:24.971
You're under arrest.

22:03.997 --> 22:05.504
Thanks.

22:19.570 --> 22:21.263
Wait out here.

22:24.665 --> 22:26.741
It's okay,

22:26.782 --> 22:28.540
it's clean.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.937
We each have a wound,

22:41.364 --> 22:43.153
a humiliation,

22:43.309 --> 22:45.132
a death to mourn.

22:45.175 --> 22:48.546
The hand that's hurt us all
is the same.

22:48.622 --> 22:50.333
It's Savastano's.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.301
Some of you lost a brother,

22:56.963 --> 22:58.810
or a father,

23:01.176 --> 23:03.433
because of Gennaro and his guys.

23:04.211 --> 23:06.916
But that's history.

23:08.236 --> 23:12.443
The ones who treated us like slaves
are now hiding in some fucking hole

23:12.881 --> 23:15.176
or hooked to a machine to stay alive.

23:15.605 --> 23:17.670
They mustn't come back.

23:21.038 --> 23:23.996
Me and Salvatore Conte made a promise

23:24.381 --> 23:26.330
and we're keeping it.

23:28.163 --> 23:31.592
You are all the ones who count most
at the dealing spots.

23:34.874 --> 23:37.712
Today, anyone
who puts money on this table,

23:37.772 --> 23:41.282
buys a share of the stuff
that Salvatore's bringing in.

23:43.462 --> 23:46.369
The spots you handled
on Savastano's payroll,

23:46.532 --> 23:48.582
will be your own.

23:48.617 --> 23:51.980
The money you make
goes into your own pockets.

23:53.858 --> 23:56.049
No master.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.143
Here's mine.

24:02.111 --> 24:04.311
400 thousand euros,

24:05.100 --> 24:07.329
to start.

24:47.287 --> 24:49.299
We're ready, Don Pietro.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.528
Guys,

25:14.218 --> 25:17.955
I didn't pretend to be crazy
all this time just to get caught

25:18.140 --> 25:19.971
or get shot.

25:20.404 --> 25:22.591
I gotta leave here,

25:22.772 --> 25:26.838
but from this moment,
here in Naples you're my eyes,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.846
my hands,

25:32.432 --> 25:34.249
my heart

25:35.653 --> 25:38.028
and my anger.

25:39.297 --> 25:41.744
And I assure you of one thing:

25:43.807 --> 25:46.783
we'll take back
everything that's ours.

27:11.535 --> 27:13.300
Debora!

27:14.305 --> 27:15.751
Deb.

27:18.341 --> 27:20.666
There's no more danger.

27:42.584 --> 27:45.184
See how happy Maria Rita is?

27:45.312 --> 27:47.604
She's got all her things again.

27:50.403 --> 27:52.549
I'm happy too.

27:53.085 --> 27:54.995
Our home...

27:57.860 --> 27:59.260
Deb...

28:00.881 --> 28:03.595
A great life's starting, you'll see,

28:04.647 --> 28:06.922
the greatest life ever.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.315
How about a smile?

28:16.986 --> 28:18.805
I gotta go.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.582
- Where?
- Got things to do.

28:20.633 --> 28:22.349
I'll be back later, Fernando's here.

28:22.408 --> 28:23.872
Bye, Maria Rita!

28:23.944 --> 28:25.625
Bye, Daddy!

29:18.899 --> 29:21.232
Rita, be careful!

29:35.841 --> 29:37.818
Mrs. Di Marzio!

29:37.957 --> 29:39.384
Hello.

29:39.450 --> 29:40.526
Hello.

29:40.591 --> 29:43.342
Your husband got my son a job.

29:43.376 --> 29:46.117
I want to thank you, we owe you

29:46.180 --> 29:47.925
and we're at your disposal.

29:47.993 --> 29:49.779
Thank you so much!

29:49.854 --> 29:52.278
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

30:14.985 --> 30:16.566
Maria!

30:22.403 --> 30:24.051
Rita!

30:24.095 --> 30:27.632
Lady Debora, she was right here,
don't worry.

30:28.610 --> 30:30.653
Maria Rita!

30:32.789 --> 30:34.741
There she is!

30:40.025 --> 30:42.467
I told you she was here.

30:44.603 --> 30:46.040
Rita...

30:47.450 --> 30:49.090
Get off the bike.

30:49.375 --> 30:50.964
Get off.

31:09.301 --> 31:12.967
Some guys came last night
and took everything.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.239
We couldn't do a thing.

31:33.439 --> 31:35.907
Fuck, there's nothing left,
not even here!

31:35.977 --> 31:37.777
They took all the weapons,

31:37.858 --> 31:39.727
those bastards!

31:49.664 --> 31:51.800
Let's take what's left.

32:07.971 --> 32:09.923
Where's Mommy?

32:15.180 --> 32:17.563
What the fuck's going on?
Why all those suitcases?

32:17.720 --> 32:20.344
I'm not staying there,
or here either.

32:20.450 --> 32:22.514
We're not going anywhere!

32:22.916 --> 32:25.948
Don't you see,
I can't take it anymore.

32:26.025 --> 32:27.384
Calm down!

32:27.468 --> 32:30.200
- I'm scared.
- I said: calm down!

32:30.272 --> 32:34.183
No, I can't calm down,
this is no way to live!

32:34.977 --> 32:36.841
- Take your hands off!
- Who's touching?

32:36.890 --> 32:39.745
- Take your hands off me!
- Who's touching you?

32:42.930 --> 32:45.681
Calm down! Calm down!

32:46.992 --> 32:49.689
I said: calm down.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.259
Listen to me:

32:52.310 --> 32:55.786
There's no reason to be scared.
We won, hear me?

32:57.262 --> 32:59.557
It's all over.

33:00.696 --> 33:02.983
The Savastanos won't be back.

33:03.730 --> 33:05.477
Calm down.

33:06.272 --> 33:07.915
Calm down.

33:37.379 --> 33:38.980
Ciro...

33:40.087 --> 33:42.312
take us far away.

33:42.527 --> 33:45.358
- Or I'll find someone who will.
- Shut up!

33:45.416 --> 33:47.091
Shut up!

34:44.792 --> 34:46.908
I have to go out,

34:47.000 --> 34:48.967
but I'll be right back.

34:49.030 --> 34:51.612
Stay here,
Daddy's men are right outside.

34:58.902 --> 35:01.631
- What is it, Lady Debora?
- Take me to the old house.

35:01.716 --> 35:03.306
- Now?
- Yes.

36:23.418 --> 36:25.518
She ran off.

36:27.163 --> 36:30.259
I thought it was good for her
to come here.

36:30.362 --> 36:33.191
She said: "Wait", went up
and I never saw her again.

36:33.305 --> 36:34.806
Idiot...

36:34.887 --> 36:38.297
You're a piece of shit!
I left her with you

36:38.354 --> 36:40.071
and you...

36:40.140 --> 36:42.485
Sorry, you're right.

36:42.612 --> 36:44.737
No way that's fucking good!

36:46.925 --> 36:50.451
- Should we worry about Debora?
- No, just the dealing spots!

36:50.476 --> 36:51.721
Ciro...

36:52.823 --> 36:54.410
I'm your brother.

36:54.866 --> 36:58.862
If she fucks up,
I'm not your problem.

37:00.409 --> 37:02.453
We have to find her.

38:46.305 --> 38:48.261
The stuff's here in a couple of days,

38:48.312 --> 38:50.618
it's good, you can cut it
to 1.5, or 2, right?

38:50.710 --> 38:52.454
Up to 3, no problem.

38:52.518 --> 38:55.208
If a guy's smart like him, even 3.

38:56.296 --> 38:58.529
I can give it to you for 30 thousand.

38:58.584 --> 39:00.316
Excuse me a minute.

39:03.856 --> 39:06.092
Ciro, I found her.

39:06.474 --> 39:07.965
Where is she?

39:10.487 --> 39:12.735
It's like you thought.

39:20.244 --> 39:23.623
- You were talking about the price...
- 30 thousand.

39:24.346 --> 39:27.515
- Okay for you?
- Yeah.

39:29.008 --> 39:31.015
Things alright, Ciro?

39:32.958 --> 39:35.771
What happened to your hand?

39:37.397 --> 39:40.362
An accident at home, it's nothin'.

39:46.784 --> 39:48.771
To 3...

39:49.464 --> 39:51.591
Really?

39:52.409 --> 39:54.003
Yeah.

40:03.086 --> 40:04.789
Maria!

40:10.147 --> 40:12.102
Maria Rita!

40:20.471 --> 40:21.857
Maria!

40:40.607 --> 40:42.794
Where's my daughter?

40:43.805 --> 40:46.691
She went out with Rosaria,
Teresa and Simonetta,

40:49.444 --> 40:52.203
they took her for a pizza.

40:53.696 --> 40:56.234
She was at home all day.

41:00.515 --> 41:02.772
I want to say I'm sorry,

41:03.998 --> 41:06.324
I lost my head.

41:09.194 --> 41:11.972
I can't stand seeing you like this.

41:14.287 --> 41:16.549
How about doing something?

41:17.262 --> 41:19.792
Let's go out, just us two.

41:22.523 --> 41:25.220
How long since we had some fun?

41:27.450 --> 41:29.331
We'll go out alone,

41:29.387 --> 41:31.402
just the two of us.

41:32.089 --> 41:34.062
What do you say?

41:35.035 --> 41:36.602
C'mon!

42:12.006 --> 42:13.866
You know, Debora...

42:16.686 --> 42:20.517
When me and Attilio were kids
and doing our first heists,

42:22.795 --> 42:24.399
we'd come here,

42:26.297 --> 42:28.290
and look at this place,

42:29.572 --> 42:32.529
but we couldn't go in,
we stayed outside,

42:33.355 --> 42:35.584
we had just a few cents between us.

42:37.295 --> 42:39.758
We'd daydream.

42:45.977 --> 42:48.340
But now look...

42:51.658 --> 42:54.414
The most beautiful woman
in the world is by my side

42:56.329 --> 42:59.574
and a little girl
who bursts my heart with joy.

43:11.441 --> 43:13.022
Debora...

43:22.606 --> 43:26.514
More than anyone,
you know what I did to get us here.

43:29.957 --> 43:32.134
So, where are we now?

43:33.694 --> 43:35.982
We're on top.

43:37.101 --> 43:58.075
(T)(U)(S)(U)(B)(T)(I)(T)(U)(L)(O).(C)(O)(M)

44:25.766 --> 44:27.279
Debora!

44:32.774 --> 44:34.548
Listen...

44:35.871 --> 44:38.213
We're this close,

44:38.461 --> 44:39.998
understand?

44:40.130 --> 44:42.217
We're almost there.

44:42.648 --> 44:44.360
No one can stop us.

44:44.414 --> 44:47.369
If you don't stop now,
someone else will stop us.

44:48.981 --> 44:52.160
No one's stopping me, understand?

44:53.215 --> 44:56.615
- No one's stopping me.
- Or me either! Hands off me!

44:59.520 --> 45:02.431
Don't you know all I did
to get this far?

45:02.498 --> 45:04.364
I can't stop now!

45:04.430 --> 45:06.377
I'll stop you!

45:07.777 --> 45:10.474
Are you crazy? You're crazy?

45:11.480 --> 45:13.373
You're crazy!

45:13.788 --> 45:15.585
You're crazy!

45:15.638 --> 45:17.711
Calm down! Calm down!

45:18.429 --> 45:19.938
Calm down, Debora!

45:19.981 --> 45:21.437
Calm down!

45:21.484 --> 45:22.962
Calm down!

45:26.494 --> 45:28.279
You gotta calm down!

45:28.376 --> 45:30.388
Will you calm down?

45:30.439 --> 45:32.330
Will you calm down?

45:32.530 --> 45:34.184
Calm down!

45:34.365 --> 45:36.172
Calm down!

45:38.230 --> 45:40.391
You gotta trust me.

45:42.193 --> 45:44.451
Will you calm down?

45:45.769 --> 45:47.860
Will you calm down?

45:53.567 --> 45:55.987
Calm down!

45:56.174 --> 45:57.724
Calm down!

48:21.515 --> 48:24.196
Today's a great day,

48:24.250 --> 48:27.158
we've baptized a new alliance,

48:27.222 --> 48:29.778
where we all decide together.

48:30.550 --> 48:35.260
I buy the stuff for everyone,
we're all kings in our own house.

48:37.439 --> 48:40.572
We made the United States
of Scampia-Secondigliano

48:41.331 --> 48:43.447
and may God bless us.

48:43.514 --> 48:45.986
The Flori and Berlingieri neighborhoods
are outside these United States.

48:46.121 --> 48:48.974
A few assholes who still believe
in the Savastanos.

48:49.737 --> 48:51.937
But we can't make war now,

48:52.334 --> 48:54.917
we have to keep them
locked up in there.

48:54.979 --> 48:58.809
In a few months,
they'll be groveling at our door.

48:58.870 --> 49:01.123
Now let's make a toast.

49:01.178 --> 49:03.445
- Bring a bottle.
- Come here!

49:06.314 --> 49:08.166
Please, Don Salvatore.

49:08.287 --> 49:10.376
Here's to all our enemies!

49:10.869 --> 49:12.494
Here.

49:16.467 --> 49:18.274
Are you ready?

49:35.725 --> 49:37.852
Where's my glass?

49:42.028 --> 49:44.730
- Here's to us!
- To us!

49:56.022 --> 49:57.877
They're hers.

49:58.733 --> 50:00.385
Your signature here.

51:02.665 --> 51:05.161
Blood breeds blood,
violence breeds violence,

51:05.217 --> 51:07.944
in a spiral of revenge
that's transforming Naples

51:07.990 --> 51:10.768
into a city where
a bloody Camorra war

51:10.806 --> 51:12.756
generates terror among the people.

51:12.795 --> 51:14.625
The latest murder
in the outskirts as usual...

51:14.692 --> 51:16.060
Hello?

51:16.102 --> 51:19.211
...and with the usual brutality.
The victim is a woman...

51:19.271 --> 51:20.843
Yes, coming.

51:20.892 --> 51:23.939
We're in a warehouse in Melito...

52:18.016 --> 52:20.604
Physical conditions
have decidedly improved,

52:20.671 --> 52:24.717
hemodynamics are stable
and there's a valid diuresis.
