03:10.347 --> 03:14.408
Sometimes he speaks
in a kind of tender dialect...

03:14.451 --> 03:17.682
of the death
which causes repentance...

03:17.721 --> 03:21.179
of the unhappy men
who certainly exist...

03:21.224 --> 03:25.251
of painful tasks
and heartrending departures.

03:26.863 --> 03:28.694
In the hovels
where we got drunk...

03:28.732 --> 03:32.190
he wept looking at those
who surrounded us...

03:32.235 --> 03:35.033
a cattle of poverty.

03:35.071 --> 03:38.404
He lifted up drunks
in the black streets.

03:38.441 --> 03:41.672
He had the pity a bad mother
has for small children.

03:41.711 --> 03:45.875
He moved with the grace
of a little girl at catechism.

03:45.915 --> 03:48.475
He pretended to know
about everything...

03:48.518 --> 03:52.511
business, art, medicine.

03:53.990 --> 03:56.117
I followed him.

03:56.159 --> 03:57.990
I had to.

04:11.207 --> 04:14.665
Someone for you, sir.
Over there.

04:14.711 --> 04:16.178
Do I know her?

04:18.714 --> 04:20.706
She gave me her card.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.706
Please...

04:44.741 --> 04:46.231
Please sit down.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.712
Has Andre
been looking after you?

04:50.747 --> 04:54.205
Can I get you
something to drink?

04:54.250 --> 04:55.740
No, thank you.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.743
Please.

05:04.194 --> 05:06.162
It's really
a business matter...

05:06.196 --> 05:08.858
I want to discuss
with you, Mr. Verlaine.

05:13.703 --> 05:16.672
This was published
a few months ago...

05:16.706 --> 05:22.110
an unauthorized selection
of my brother's poems.

05:22.145 --> 05:24.170
My mother and I
are anxious to prevent...

05:24.214 --> 05:26.739
anything like this
from happening again.

05:26.783 --> 05:29.013
We thought you might
be able to help us.

05:29.052 --> 05:31.213
I? How?

05:31.254 --> 05:33.688
I understand you have
a large number...

05:33.723 --> 05:35.953
of my brother's manuscripts.

05:35.992 --> 05:37.687
I have some, yes.

05:37.727 --> 05:40.924
My mother and I
would be very grateful...

05:40.964 --> 05:42.955
if you would return them.

05:44.968 --> 05:48.062
I've always tried to use
the utmost discretion...

05:48.104 --> 05:49.901
in everything
concerning your brother.

05:49.939 --> 05:54.103
I think I can say I've always
defended his interests.

05:54.143 --> 05:56.373
Sometimes I wonder why,
since in many ways...

05:56.412 --> 05:58.380
they're diametrically
opposed to my own.

05:58.414 --> 06:00.041
I don't see how.

06:00.083 --> 06:04.144
It took many years for his work
to be understood...

06:04.187 --> 06:06.655
but once his name
began to be known...

06:06.689 --> 06:10.147
it soon became clear
that our ways were numbered.

06:10.193 --> 06:14.391
The music of old-fashioned verse
was no longer enough.

06:14.430 --> 06:16.398
He swept us away.

06:16.432 --> 06:19.333
Not that I mind, you understand.

06:19.369 --> 06:22.202
I know I was once a good writer.

06:23.673 --> 06:27.507
I didn't know his name
was so well-known.

06:27.544 --> 06:31.674
Yes.
The young understand him now.

06:31.714 --> 06:34.205
He's the voice of the future.

06:39.222 --> 06:40.689
What matters to me most...

06:40.723 --> 06:43.214
is that we did
our best work together.

06:45.228 --> 06:47.219
Both of us.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.667
Morning!

08:07.176 --> 08:10.145
I'm looking for Paul Verlaine.

08:10.179 --> 08:12.147
Are you Monsieur Rimbaud?

08:12.181 --> 08:13.648
Yes.

08:13.683 --> 08:16.151
Monsieur Verlaine
is not with you, then?

08:16.185 --> 08:17.584
No.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.747
He went to the station
to meet you.

08:19.789 --> 08:22.189
He doesn't know what
I look like, does he?

08:22.225 --> 08:24.659
I am
Mrs. Maute de Fleurville...

08:24.694 --> 08:26.753
Monsieur Verlaine's
mother-in-law,

08:26.796 --> 08:29.697
and this is my daughter...
Mrs. Verlaine.

08:40.842 --> 08:43.437
How did you get
from the station?

08:43.479 --> 08:44.946
Walked.

08:44.981 --> 08:47.279
Perhaps you'd like a wash.

08:52.055 --> 08:53.716
No.

08:53.756 --> 08:55.451
You're even younger
than we imagined.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.959
How old are you?

08:57.994 --> 09:01.452
Darling, it's not polite
to ask people their ages.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.055
I need a piss.

09:07.170 --> 09:10.139
How old are you,
if you don't mind?

09:10.173 --> 09:12.141
He does.

09:12.175 --> 09:14.803
Sixteen.

09:14.844 --> 09:18.075
You did say in your letter
you were twenty-one.

09:18.114 --> 09:20.810
I noticed you at the station...

09:20.850 --> 09:23.148
but I didn't think
it could be you.

09:23.186 --> 09:24.483
Likewise.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.488
Those poems you sent me...

09:26.522 --> 09:31.550
were remarkable
for someone of twenty-one.

09:31.594 --> 09:34.256
For someone of sixteen,
they're unprecedented.

09:34.297 --> 09:36.663
That's why I told you
I was twenty-one.

09:36.699 --> 09:39.167
I didn't want you
to feel patronizing...

09:39.202 --> 09:41.193
before you'd read them.

09:42.939 --> 09:47.000
Of course. I hope your mother
isn't too angry with me.

09:47.043 --> 09:49.102
Once she'd found out
you'd sent the fare...

09:49.145 --> 09:50.612
she seemed quite happy.

10:03.159 --> 10:06.424
You come from the Ardennes,
don't you, Monsieur Rimbaud?

10:06.462 --> 10:08.657
Yes.

10:08.698 --> 10:11.098
Pleasant town,
Charleville, isn't it?

10:11.134 --> 10:12.897
Last place on God's earth.

10:12.935 --> 10:15.904
What does your father do?

10:15.938 --> 10:17.872
Drinks mostly, I believe.

10:17.907 --> 10:19.431
We haven't seen him
for ten years.

10:19.475 --> 10:21.102
I'm sorry.

10:21.144 --> 10:23.738
No need.
He's very well out of it.

10:27.383 --> 10:30.284
Perhaps you'd like to read
something to us after dinner.

10:30.319 --> 10:32.549
No. I don't think so.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.783
- Why not?
- Don't want to.

10:34.824 --> 10:36.655
I never read out my poetry.

10:36.692 --> 10:38.785
All the other poets do.

10:38.828 --> 10:41.092
I'm not interested
in what they do.

10:41.130 --> 10:43.121
We have soirees.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.833
And you think poets
can learn from one another?

10:50.606 --> 10:52.471
Only if they're bad poets.

11:01.717 --> 11:03.685
You know about this?

11:03.719 --> 11:05.710
I know what it is.

11:07.723 --> 11:09.657
It's the poet's third eye.

11:11.093 --> 11:12.890
Melts glasses.

11:21.704 --> 11:24.332
What do you think of my wife?

11:24.373 --> 11:26.671
I don't know.

11:27.677 --> 11:29.201
What do you think of her?

11:29.245 --> 11:32.840
She's still only a child,
of course.

11:32.882 --> 11:34.406
So am I.

11:41.257 --> 11:43.088
Absinthe, two.

11:45.862 --> 11:48.194
You should do something
about getting it published.

11:48.231 --> 11:50.256
Why?

11:50.299 --> 11:52.733
Because that's what writers do.

11:52.768 --> 11:54.963
I couldn't care less
about being published.

11:55.004 --> 11:57.905
The only thing that matters
is the writing itself.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.670
Everything else is literature.

12:00.710 --> 12:03.178
Your last book
wasn't good enough.

12:03.212 --> 12:05.180
You don't think so?

12:05.214 --> 12:07.182
Premarital garbage.

12:07.216 --> 12:09.411
No. Love poems.

12:09.452 --> 12:12.182
A lot of people
found them very beautiful.

12:12.221 --> 12:14.485
But they're all lies.

12:14.523 --> 12:16.991
They're not lies. I love her.

12:17.026 --> 12:19.426
- Love?
- Yes.

12:19.462 --> 12:22.693
- No such thing.
- What do you mean?

12:22.732 --> 12:26.361
Whatever binds families
and married couples together...

12:26.402 --> 12:28.199
that's not love.

12:28.237 --> 12:30.705
That's stupidity
or selfishness or fear.

12:30.740 --> 12:33.208
Love doesn't exist.

12:33.242 --> 12:34.971
You're wrong.

12:36.746 --> 12:38.714
Self-interest exists.

12:38.748 --> 12:41.717
Attachment based on
personal gain exists.

12:41.751 --> 12:44.219
Complacency exists.

12:44.253 --> 12:45.743
But not love.

12:49.492 --> 12:51.824
Love has to be reinvented.

12:54.030 --> 12:58.228
Why did he want so much
to escape from reality?

12:58.267 --> 13:01.168
There never was a man
with such an aim.

13:01.203 --> 13:04.604
Did he perhaps know secrets
to change life?

13:06.208 --> 13:08.506
"Sometimes I've seen...

13:08.544 --> 13:11.206
"what people
think they've seen."

13:16.218 --> 13:18.709
He's not how I imagined him.

13:22.725 --> 13:25.694
"I've wept too many tears...

13:25.728 --> 13:28.219
"heartbreaking dawns."

13:32.068 --> 13:35.196
I prefer your poems.

13:35.237 --> 13:38.229
I don't really understand
that kind of thing.

13:40.242 --> 13:41.732
No.

13:44.246 --> 13:46.407
No. This is something new.

13:50.753 --> 13:54.211
"I've wept too many tears...

13:54.256 --> 13:57.953
"heartbreaking dawns."

14:58.254 --> 14:59.846
What is it?

14:59.889 --> 15:01.356
He's kicking.

15:15.371 --> 15:16.861
You see?

15:20.443 --> 15:22.172
There.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.425
Don't you think
it would be more sensible...

15:39.462 --> 15:42.761
to get one of
your friends to put him up?

15:51.907 --> 15:54.967
People don't understand him.

15:55.010 --> 15:57.205
I'm the only one
who understands him.

15:57.246 --> 16:00.682
Well, Daddy certainly
won't understand him.

16:05.654 --> 16:08.919
We had a revolution this year
which I supported.

16:08.958 --> 16:10.926
I could have been shot.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.689
If I hadn't been
thrown out of my job...

16:12.728 --> 16:16.494
you think I would have accepted
your father's damn charity?

16:36.051 --> 16:40.044
For God's sake, all I'm doing
is helping a friend!

16:40.089 --> 16:44.685
Why must we go through all this?
I'm your husband!

16:44.727 --> 16:46.217
I'm sorry, Paul.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.864
Are you trying to annoy me?

16:50.900 --> 16:52.197
No.

16:52.234 --> 16:53.724
Well, don't.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.673
Evening!
Everyone's in bed, I'm afraid...

17:38.714 --> 17:41.683
unless you've come
to see the old boy.

17:41.717 --> 17:43.412
The old boy?

17:43.452 --> 17:45.886
Maute de Fleurville.
A friend of his?

17:45.921 --> 17:47.718
No.

17:47.756 --> 17:51.658
You wouldn't like to buy
a crucifix, would you?

17:51.694 --> 17:56.188
I can let you have this one
on extremely reasonable terms.

17:56.232 --> 17:58.700
It's made with real pearls,
I think.

17:58.734 --> 18:00.634
Who the hell are you?

18:00.669 --> 18:03.137
I might ask you
the same question...

18:03.172 --> 18:05.140
except I'd be more polite.

18:05.174 --> 18:07.165
I am Maute de Fleurville.

18:16.085 --> 18:17.643
Then this is your dog
I just broke.

18:17.686 --> 18:19.017
What?

18:20.689 --> 18:22.657
Why?

18:22.691 --> 18:24.181
Dogs are all liberals.

18:36.438 --> 18:38.167
Since when
have you had the right...

18:38.207 --> 18:41.973
to invite people into this house
without my permission?

18:44.213 --> 18:47.182
If I can't put up a guest
in my own home...

18:47.216 --> 18:50.708
I might as well
live somewhere else.

18:50.753 --> 18:53.551
If you weren't so idle,
you could afford to.

18:53.589 --> 18:56.820
- You know very well...
- Any excuse.

18:56.859 --> 19:00.158
I don't notice you working
your fingers to the bone.

19:00.195 --> 19:02.459
When you next see
that hooligan...

19:02.498 --> 19:06.628
kindly ask him to return
the objects he's pilfered.

19:06.669 --> 19:09.502
- What are you talking about?
- He'll know.

19:09.538 --> 19:12.974
Ask him yourself.

19:13.008 --> 19:15.909
I'm happy to say,
he's left the house.

19:15.944 --> 19:17.172
What?

19:49.745 --> 19:50.939
Thank God.

19:50.979 --> 19:53.277
I thought I would
never find you.

19:53.315 --> 19:57.183
I don't know what that bastard
thought he was doing.

19:57.219 --> 19:58.686
It's his house.

19:58.721 --> 20:00.188
Yes. Come on.

20:00.222 --> 20:02.213
We'll find you somewhere.

20:33.122 --> 20:34.453
It's not much, I'm afraid.

20:49.938 --> 20:51.735
Just for a few days.

20:51.774 --> 20:54.004
It's fine.

20:59.381 --> 21:01.281
So do you love her?

21:01.316 --> 21:05.184
Of course. She's ideal.

21:05.220 --> 21:08.246
Eighteen, beautiful,
plenty of money...

21:08.290 --> 21:11.316
all the wifely virtues,
and she's giving me a baby.

21:11.360 --> 21:15.694
- Do you have anything in common?
- No.

21:15.731 --> 21:18.757
- Is she intelligent?
- No.

21:18.801 --> 21:20.564
Does she understand you?

21:22.738 --> 21:24.296
No.

21:24.339 --> 21:28.935
Then the only thing
she can give you is sex.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.864
Hi!

21:58.907 --> 22:01.034
Hey!

22:10.719 --> 22:12.687
Did you find him?

22:12.721 --> 22:14.211
I did.

22:18.727 --> 22:21.753
And did he give you back
Daddy's crucifix?

22:23.499 --> 22:26.900
If your father's capable
of throwing that boy out...

22:26.935 --> 22:31.167
he's got no right having Christ
hanging all over his walls.

22:37.980 --> 22:42.542
You people don't understand
what poverty is.

22:42.584 --> 22:44.711
In Charleville,
if he wanted a book...

22:44.753 --> 22:46.721
he had to steal it.

22:46.755 --> 22:49.747
That proves
what kind of person he is.

22:59.868 --> 23:01.927
I'm sorry.

23:04.873 --> 23:07.171
You shouldn't have said that.

23:07.209 --> 23:08.972
I'm sorry.

23:09.011 --> 23:11.275
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

23:14.917 --> 23:17.181
Are you all right, my dear?

23:17.219 --> 23:19.210
Yes, I'm all right.

23:41.577 --> 23:45.206
It was last summer
during the war...

23:45.247 --> 23:49.206
one of the many times
I ran away from home.

23:49.251 --> 23:53.711
I came down to the river
to fill my water bottle...

23:53.755 --> 23:57.589
and there was a Prussian soldier
not much older than me...

23:57.626 --> 23:59.753
asleep in the clearing.

24:03.632 --> 24:06.863
I watched him for a long time
before I realized...

24:08.437 --> 24:10.166
he wasn't asleep.

24:10.205 --> 24:11.695
He was dead.

24:15.711 --> 24:18.703
And somehow that
clarified things for me.

24:22.217 --> 24:24.685
I understood
that what I needed...

24:24.720 --> 24:27.689
to become the first poet
of this century...

24:27.723 --> 24:30.715
was to experience
everything in my body.

24:33.462 --> 24:36.727
It was no longer enough
for me to be one person.

24:40.235 --> 24:42.226
I decided to be everyone.

24:45.741 --> 24:48.232
I decided to be a genius.

24:51.747 --> 24:54.238
I decided
to originate the future.

25:17.706 --> 25:19.196
Thank you.

25:28.850 --> 25:31.250
The principle
is very like photography...

25:31.286 --> 25:33.686
only instead of
photographing a man's face...

25:33.722 --> 25:35.690
you photograph his voice.

25:35.724 --> 25:37.692
Then twenty years later...

25:37.726 --> 25:40.695
just as you'd open
a photograph album...

25:40.729 --> 25:44.688
you put the relevant cylinder
into the paleophone...

25:44.733 --> 25:49.864
and you listen to
a poet reading his poems...

25:49.905 --> 25:51.805
or singing his songs.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.866
And you think
you could invent...

25:54.910 --> 25:57.879
a machine like that
which worked?

25:57.913 --> 25:59.710
For Christ's sake,
let's get the fuck out of here.

25:59.748 --> 26:01.909
- We can't.
- Why not?

26:01.950 --> 26:05.386
- He's about to read.
- Which one?

26:05.420 --> 26:08.184
Aicard. Over there.

26:08.223 --> 26:10.714
I don't think
I'll like him very much.

26:10.759 --> 26:13.227
Verlaine showed me
some of your poems.

26:13.261 --> 26:14.728
Yes?

26:14.763 --> 26:16.196
Remarkable. Very promising.

26:16.231 --> 26:20.861
Only, it seems all
that ingenuity is marred by...

26:20.902 --> 26:22.335
Well, not exactly
a juvenile urge to shock...

26:22.370 --> 26:24.338
but something of the sort.

26:24.372 --> 26:27.341
- And were you shocked?
- No, I wasn't.

26:27.375 --> 26:30.344
Then why would you suppose
I intended you to be?

26:30.378 --> 26:32.346
That's not really the point.

26:32.380 --> 26:33.847
Seems fair enough to me.

26:33.882 --> 26:36.407
I could object
to your technical approach.

26:36.451 --> 26:38.919
I could object to your tie.

26:38.954 --> 26:40.922
He doesn't like
discussing his poetry.

26:40.956 --> 26:42.446
I see.

26:44.126 --> 26:46.617
A surprise for our friend.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.098
Thank you.

26:55.137 --> 26:57.105
Thank you, gentlemen.

26:57.139 --> 27:00.768
Sulfuric acid.

27:00.809 --> 27:03.539
I would ask you
to bear this in mind...

27:03.578 --> 27:06.706
although, as with all
worthwhile work for children...

27:06.748 --> 27:10.878
it's hoped what is said
is of relevance to adults.

27:10.919 --> 27:13.888
The poem is called
"Green Absinthe."

27:13.922 --> 27:18.723
Green absinthe is the potion
of the damned...

27:18.760 --> 27:21.228
a deadly poison
silting up the veins...

27:21.263 --> 27:24.232
while wife and child
sit weeping in their slum...

27:24.266 --> 27:25.733
I don't believe it.

27:25.767 --> 27:27.735
...pours absinthe
into his brains.

27:27.769 --> 27:29.236
Shit.

27:29.271 --> 27:31.239
O drunkard,
most contemptible of men...

27:31.273 --> 27:34.800
- Shit!
- Be quiet.

27:34.843 --> 27:37.073
It's authentic shit!

27:37.112 --> 27:38.511
Please!

27:38.547 --> 27:41.072
...degraded, fallen,
sinful, and obtuse...

27:41.116 --> 27:42.947
I like it!

27:42.984 --> 27:45.077
...to beat
your wife and child...

27:45.120 --> 27:47.588
For trying to deprive you
of the juice!

27:47.622 --> 27:49.988
- Get out!
- Me?

27:50.025 --> 27:52.858
Yes, you offensive
little bastard. Get out.

27:52.894 --> 27:55.829
I think I may be permitted
to raise some objection...

27:55.864 --> 27:57.832
against the butchering
of French poetry.

27:57.866 --> 28:00.426
No, you may not.
Apologize and get out!

28:00.468 --> 28:02.459
Don't come near.

28:02.504 --> 28:04.199
Be careful!

28:04.239 --> 28:07.265
You think you can frighten me
with that thing.

28:07.309 --> 28:09.470
Careful! Careful, I say!

28:13.048 --> 28:14.538
Get out!

28:14.583 --> 28:16.073
Come on.

28:21.323 --> 28:24.019
Now you, you fucking...

28:24.059 --> 28:26.050
Come here!

28:26.094 --> 28:29.291
Come here!

28:29.331 --> 28:32.061
In the days of Francois I...

28:32.100 --> 28:35.228
wise and benevolent giants
roamed the countryside...

28:35.270 --> 28:37.568
and one of
their primary functions...

28:37.606 --> 28:40.507
was to rid the world
of pedants...

28:40.542 --> 28:45.673
fools... and writers
of no talent...

28:45.714 --> 28:47.545
by pissing on them
from a great height.

29:10.839 --> 29:13.774
How to make your way
in the literary world.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.548
The depressing thing
about this city...

29:21.583 --> 29:23.710
is that the artists
are even more bourgeois...

29:23.752 --> 29:25.982
than the fucking bourgeoisie.

30:09.264 --> 30:10.993
We should make a bargain.

30:12.701 --> 30:16.728
You help me, and I'll help you.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.204
If we go away together...

30:18.239 --> 30:21.367
I'm sure you'll be able
to do good work again.

30:21.409 --> 30:26.540
And when we've taken as much
as we can from each other...

30:26.581 --> 30:29.607
we simply split up and move on.

30:29.651 --> 30:33.314
And how would we live?

30:33.355 --> 30:35.880
You have some money,
don't you?

30:40.929 --> 30:42.897
I understand.

30:42.931 --> 30:45.798
I help you by supporting you...

30:45.834 --> 30:49.702
and you help me by renewing
my rusty old inspiration.

30:49.738 --> 30:51.797
Is that it?

31:06.688 --> 31:08.656
Not altogether.

31:41.089 --> 31:43.683
Where have you been?

31:43.725 --> 31:48.128
I thought I'd probably
just get in the way.

31:48.163 --> 31:50.131
Don't shout.

31:50.165 --> 31:52.292
You'll wake the baby.

32:02.343 --> 32:04.106
Is it a boy?

32:04.145 --> 32:06.079
Yes.

32:15.023 --> 32:17.218
Funny-looking little bugger.

32:22.330 --> 32:23.592
Don't.

32:23.631 --> 32:26.122
All right.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.362
All right.

32:49.090 --> 32:50.751
Thank you.

32:55.530 --> 32:57.498
Thank you.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.739
Please.

33:12.113 --> 33:14.809
Why not?

33:17.018 --> 33:19.452
The baby was born.

34:04.265 --> 34:07.564
- Isabelle!
- I didn't know you were coming.

34:07.602 --> 34:10.070
Where is the mouth of darkness?

34:10.103 --> 34:13.072
Mother? She's in
the fields with Vitalie.

34:13.107 --> 34:16.007
- Do you want to see her?
- No.

34:43.237 --> 34:44.728
Thanks.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.713
Are you back for good?

34:55.650 --> 34:57.618
For good I don't know.

34:57.652 --> 34:59.483
For better or worse.

34:59.520 --> 35:04.219
There's work to be done
in the fields.

35:04.259 --> 35:05.692
There's work to be done here.

35:05.727 --> 35:09.254
I thought you were
getting on well in Paris.

35:09.297 --> 35:11.822
Verlaine's wife
started to make trouble.

35:11.866 --> 35:13.800
What kind of trouble?

35:13.835 --> 35:16.269
Threatening a divorce.

35:16.304 --> 35:18.966
She thought we were spending
too much time together.

35:19.007 --> 35:21.202
Spoiled rich girl, I suppose.

35:21.242 --> 35:23.335
That's right.

35:25.513 --> 35:27.811
This work you're doing...

35:27.849 --> 35:30.977
is it the kind of thing
that will lead to anything?

35:31.019 --> 35:34.420
I don't know.

35:34.455 --> 35:37.049
Nevertheless,
it's the kind of work I do.

36:36.117 --> 36:39.883
I don't suppose Paris
ever gets as exciting as this.

38:03.871 --> 38:08.069
You look like a fucking saint.

38:23.124 --> 38:27.060
Except you haven't
got your halo.

38:34.001 --> 38:36.868
I'll give you your halo.

39:26.087 --> 39:28.783
He's back, isn't he?

39:34.595 --> 39:36.961
I can't leave
Mathilde at the moment.

39:36.998 --> 39:38.488
She's not very well.

39:38.533 --> 39:42.025
I'm not surprised if you keep
setting fire to her.

39:42.069 --> 39:45.436
I haven't set fire
to her since Thursday.

39:52.613 --> 39:54.604
No, it's not very funny.

40:05.126 --> 40:07.651
It's pathetic.

40:07.695 --> 40:11.096
Your acts of violence
are always curiously disgusting.

40:11.132 --> 40:13.191
What do you mean?

40:15.136 --> 40:17.627
They're not clean.

40:17.672 --> 40:20.869
You're always in
some sort of a drunken stupor.

40:20.908 --> 40:24.241
Then you start
apologizing and groveling.

40:24.278 --> 40:26.246
I don't like hurting people.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.248
Then don't.

40:28.282 --> 40:31.251
But if you do, do it coolly.

40:31.285 --> 40:35.187
Don't insult your victims
by feeling sorry afterwards.

40:38.559 --> 40:40.527
I love her, you see.

40:40.561 --> 40:43.029
You can't possibly.

40:43.064 --> 40:44.998
I love her body.

40:47.969 --> 40:49.800
There are other bodies.

40:53.174 --> 40:55.734
I love Mathilde's body.

40:55.776 --> 40:59.371
But not her soul?

40:59.413 --> 41:02.507
I think it's less important
to love the soul.

41:02.550 --> 41:05.018
After all,
the soul may be immortal.

41:05.052 --> 41:08.021
We have plenty
of time for the soul...

41:08.055 --> 41:11.252
but flesh rots.

41:11.292 --> 41:16.628
It's my love of flesh
which keeps me faithful.

41:16.664 --> 41:19.827
Faithful.

41:19.867 --> 41:21.061
What do you mean?

41:21.102 --> 41:25.004
I'm faithful to all my lovers...

41:25.039 --> 41:27.098
because once I love them...

41:27.141 --> 41:31.168
I will always love them...

41:31.212 --> 41:33.112
and when I'm alone
in the evening...

41:33.147 --> 41:35.115
or in the early morning...

41:35.149 --> 41:37.344
I close my eyes...

41:37.385 --> 41:40.354
and I celebrate them all.

41:40.388 --> 41:45.325
That's not faithfulness.
That's nostalgia.

41:45.359 --> 41:47.350
If you don't want
to leave Mathilde...

41:47.395 --> 41:49.260
it's not
because you're faithful.

41:49.296 --> 41:50.729
It's because you're weak.

41:50.765 --> 41:55.134
If strength involves brutality,
I prefer to be weak.

41:58.072 --> 42:01.269
With you, weakness involves
brutality as well.

42:10.618 --> 42:14.349
Don't expect me
to be faithful to you.

42:14.388 --> 42:16.822
Why are you so harsh with me?

42:16.857 --> 42:19.018
Because you need it.

42:19.060 --> 42:22.029
Isn't it enough
for you to know...

42:22.063 --> 42:24.930
that I love you more
than I've ever loved anyone...

42:24.965 --> 42:28.526
and that I will always love you?

42:28.569 --> 42:30.969
Shut up, you sniveling drunk.

42:31.005 --> 42:33.769
- Tell me that you love me.
- For God's sake!

42:33.808 --> 42:35.605
Please.

42:37.745 --> 42:39.736
It's important.

42:39.780 --> 42:42.544
Just say it.

42:46.854 --> 42:49.948
You know I'm very fond of you.

42:57.131 --> 42:59.929
- Do you love me?
- What?

43:01.102 --> 43:05.505
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

43:05.539 --> 43:08.565
Then put your hands
on the table.

43:08.609 --> 43:10.076
What?

43:10.111 --> 43:13.171
Put your hand on the table.

43:16.650 --> 43:17.776
Palm upwards.

44:00.361 --> 44:04.263
The only unbearable thing
is that nothing is unbearable.

45:28.649 --> 45:29.946
On...

45:32.253 --> 45:33.948
On...

45:42.429 --> 45:44.124
We have to leave.

45:45.633 --> 45:48.067
I don't know.

45:48.102 --> 45:51.094
Yes. It's time.

45:51.138 --> 45:53.606
The happiest days
of my life was last year...

45:53.641 --> 45:55.438
when I ran away from home.

45:57.978 --> 46:01.175
Didn't know where I was going.
I just carried on.

46:04.018 --> 46:09.012
I've never seen
such long and colored days...

46:09.056 --> 46:11.547
and I could never
get far enough.

46:13.093 --> 46:15.061
I've never seen the sea.

46:15.095 --> 46:18.360
I wanted to walk to Africa...

46:18.399 --> 46:20.526
and cross the desert.

46:20.567 --> 46:24.435
I wanted the sun.

46:24.471 --> 46:27.099
I wanted the sun.

46:27.141 --> 46:29.735
I want the sun.

46:29.777 --> 46:32.245
Do you understand me?
I want the sun!

46:32.279 --> 46:36.375
Where do you want to go?

46:38.319 --> 46:40.514
I don't know.

46:40.554 --> 46:43.022
I don't care. Just away.

46:43.057 --> 46:45.821
I can't leave Mathilde
right now.

46:45.859 --> 46:47.520
She's not very well.

46:47.561 --> 46:48.892
Then don't.

46:48.929 --> 46:50.726
What?

46:50.764 --> 46:53.597
Don't leave her.

48:32.966 --> 48:34.593
Wait!

48:53.120 --> 48:54.610
To life.

49:59.119 --> 50:01.053
Come on!

54:36.062 --> 54:38.223
Do you remember happier times?

54:40.133 --> 54:42.465
Why did you leave us?

54:46.039 --> 54:48.599
I had a tip-off I was going
to arrested for my work...

54:48.642 --> 54:51.611
in the propaganda press
during the Commune.

54:51.645 --> 54:54.113
But that was over a year ago.

54:54.147 --> 54:58.277
Well...
the police may be slow...

54:58.318 --> 55:00.809
but they're methodical.

55:00.854 --> 55:03.084
I couldn't bear to go to jail.

55:04.458 --> 55:08.588
I think it's best to stay out
of the country for a few months.

55:08.628 --> 55:10.596
With Rimbaud?

55:12.466 --> 55:13.899
Well...

55:13.934 --> 55:17.426
I suppose he's wanted
by the police as well.

55:17.471 --> 55:18.870
No.

55:22.042 --> 55:25.068
Why do you prefer him to me?

55:25.111 --> 55:28.046
I don't.

55:34.054 --> 55:36.022
Don't have to get dressed
right away, do you?

55:36.056 --> 55:39.822
I told Mummy
I'd meet her for breakfast.

55:39.860 --> 55:42.385
- What's she doing here?
- She came with me.

55:45.599 --> 55:48.659
That's another thing.

55:48.702 --> 55:53.105
I certainly can't stand living
with your parents anymore.

55:53.139 --> 55:56.108
It's not safe anywhere else.

55:56.142 --> 55:58.110
What do you mean?

55:58.144 --> 56:00.203
You know what I mean.

56:01.648 --> 56:04.845
Listen...

56:04.885 --> 56:07.479
I had this idea.

56:07.521 --> 56:09.614
I thought of this idea.

56:13.093 --> 56:15.584
I thought we might emigrate.

56:17.898 --> 56:20.833
Emigrate? Where to?

56:20.867 --> 56:22.266
New Caledonia.

56:22.302 --> 56:27.296
A lot of your friends
from the Commune are there.

56:27.340 --> 56:30.309
You'd be able to write.

56:30.343 --> 56:34.279
It would be like it was when
we were first married and...

56:35.282 --> 56:36.715
What?

56:36.750 --> 56:38.650
Nothing.

56:40.654 --> 56:42.281
No. Go on.

56:43.957 --> 56:48.087
I was only going to say
that you could stop...

56:48.128 --> 56:49.618
If you wanted...

56:49.663 --> 56:54.657
It would be easier for you
if you wanted to stop drinking.

57:05.145 --> 57:07.579
You're frightened of me,
aren't you?

57:09.816 --> 57:13.752
Don't think
that I like getting drunk.

57:13.787 --> 57:15.550
I mean,
I do like getting drunk.

57:15.589 --> 57:18.183
I don't like being drunk.

57:18.224 --> 57:21.284
Anyway...

57:21.328 --> 57:23.728
when I hit you...

57:23.763 --> 57:25.492
I feel so terrible
all I can think of...

57:25.532 --> 57:28.592
is to get drunk again
and forget about it.

57:28.635 --> 57:32.196
Can you see us
living in a grass hut?

57:32.238 --> 57:33.705
Why not?

57:33.740 --> 57:35.833
Let's go, for Christ's sake.

57:35.875 --> 57:38.571
Let's go before it's too late.

57:38.612 --> 57:41.706
We can go whenever you like.

57:52.626 --> 57:54.355
Not now!

57:54.394 --> 57:56.362
Why not?

57:56.396 --> 57:59.854
Help me with this.

57:59.899 --> 58:01.526
No.

58:01.568 --> 58:04.002
Help me with this.

58:04.037 --> 58:06.005
Stop!

58:15.148 --> 58:18.606
Why are you doing this to us?

58:18.652 --> 58:20.620
Don't worry.

58:20.654 --> 58:24.112
You can have him
back quite soon...

58:24.157 --> 58:27.149
and only slightly damaged.

58:28.662 --> 58:30.653
He's coming back now.

58:45.178 --> 58:47.146
What are you doing here?

58:47.180 --> 58:48.807
What's this?

58:48.848 --> 58:50.782
"My poor Mathilde...

58:50.817 --> 58:52.648
"Don't be upset. Don't cry.

58:52.686 --> 58:54.654
"This is a bad dream.

58:54.688 --> 58:57.213
"One day, I'll wake up.
Love, Paul."

58:57.257 --> 59:00.590
Nice, was it?
Scene of conjugal bliss?

59:00.627 --> 59:03.562
I'm going back
to Paris with her.

59:03.596 --> 59:05.291
Right.

59:07.133 --> 59:10.694
- Wait! Let me explain.
- Why should I?

59:10.737 --> 59:14.434
It's not what you think.
It's something else.

59:14.474 --> 59:17.136
She suggested we emigrate
to New Caledonia.

59:17.177 --> 59:18.906
It would be a change.
A quiet life.

59:18.945 --> 59:21.311
I could stop drinking.
It's a good idea.

59:21.347 --> 59:22.939
No.

59:22.982 --> 59:25.644
Don't you care about
my happiness?

59:25.685 --> 59:27.050
No, and neither should you.

59:27.087 --> 59:29.419
You don't understand
how much I love her.

59:29.456 --> 59:32.050
This morning,
she was lying there naked.

59:32.092 --> 59:37.724
She looked so beautiful,
so young and so...

59:37.764 --> 59:39.493
What's so funny?

59:39.532 --> 59:40.897
Was she really
lying there naked?

59:40.934 --> 59:42.060
Yes.

59:42.102 --> 59:44.627
My estimation for her
goes up a long way.

59:44.671 --> 59:45.968
Why?

59:46.005 --> 59:50.635
For realizing what was needed
and providing it.

59:50.677 --> 59:52.144
What does it matter?

59:52.178 --> 59:54.646
You love her, right?
Go back to her.

01:00:45.565 --> 01:00:49.023
All change!

01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:50.535
Border patrol!

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:54.062
Please have your passports
ready for inspection.

01:00:55.575 --> 01:00:57.543
Border patrol!
