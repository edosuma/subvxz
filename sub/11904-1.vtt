WEBVTT

00:59.125 --> 01:00.584
Must you? Just here?

01:00.668 --> 01:03.462
... three, two, one!

01:03.546 --> 01:05.547
Happy New Year!

01:48.051 --> 01:49.385
I do.

01:51.554 --> 01:55.058
It now gives me
great pleasure to pronounce you...

01:57.812 --> 01:58.812
Excuse me.

02:11.618 --> 02:14.078
You all right?

02:14.538 --> 02:16.622
I'm fine.

02:16.707 --> 02:19.292
- Something lodged?
- Nothing.

02:19.376 --> 02:20.960
- Water.
- What?

02:21.044 --> 02:22.878
A glass of water, please.

02:22.963 --> 02:25.006
- Where's the water?
- I don't know.

02:29.804 --> 02:31.596
Oh, dear.

02:31.681 --> 02:33.515
He's getting it from the font!

02:34.309 --> 02:35.475
Mmm.

02:43.652 --> 02:45.611
Jesus Christ. Sorry.

02:47.323 --> 02:49.574
- So sorry. Where were we?
- "I now pronounce you."

02:49.616 --> 02:51.993
- I now pronounce you.
- Yeah.

02:55.331 --> 02:58.708
- No, thank you.
- I now pronounce you...

02:58.792 --> 03:01.169
...husband and wife.

03:08.762 --> 03:09.762
Look at them.

03:09.846 --> 03:12.681
- Aren't they adorable?
- Yes.

03:13.475 --> 03:15.684
I give it a year.

03:33.371 --> 03:34.788
And for those of you who don't know me,

03:34.872 --> 03:36.873
and especially if we meet in the bar later,

03:36.957 --> 03:39.377
my name is,
"Danny Do-you-want-a-pint?"

03:39.961 --> 03:42.046
"Danny Do-you-want-a-pint?"

03:42.589 --> 03:44.131
Fornication...

03:44.758 --> 03:45.966
I'll read that again.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.593
For an occasion...

03:47.677 --> 03:48.719
like this,

03:48.804 --> 03:51.931
I want to make sure I keep up
the traditions of being a best man.

03:52.015 --> 03:54.975
Apparently I need to get the groom
to the church on time. Tick.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.603
I need to remember the rings. Did that.
And I need to...

03:57.687 --> 04:00.106
have sex with a bridesmaid. Wahey!

04:01.734 --> 04:05.070
I... To be fair, I wrote these, um...
before I knew they...

04:05.196 --> 04:06.947
I would never have sex with a...

04:07.031 --> 04:09.157
Maybe when they're older.
Never say never.

04:09.242 --> 04:11.410
And keep away from Paedo Rog! Ha-ha!

04:11.494 --> 04:12.911
All right, Paedo?
Nice to have you.

04:12.995 --> 04:14.579
He's come a long way. Good lad.

04:15.249 --> 04:19.000
It's great to see so many people turn up
to see Josh finally tie the knot.

04:19.086 --> 04:20.545
And about time, too.

04:20.629 --> 04:22.755
Nat's got it all.
She's brilliantly clever,

04:22.840 --> 04:25.216
apparently really delivers in the bedroom.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.010
Like mother like daughter, eh?
He knows what I'm talking about.

04:28.095 --> 04:29.095
And I don't know about you,

04:29.179 --> 04:31.764
but I feel she could easily be a model,
I think we'll agree,

04:32.099 --> 04:34.142
if it wasn't for her nose.

04:34.643 --> 04:36.686
When I first saw her beaver...

04:36.770 --> 04:38.688
...ing away... Beavering away,

04:38.772 --> 04:40.857
cooking Josh a meal,
I knew she was a real catch.

04:41.483 --> 04:44.611
Um, I've got no idea why
her previous boyfriend cheated on her,

04:44.696 --> 04:46.113
but, uh, I'm glad he did.

04:46.197 --> 04:47.656
Cheers to him, wherever he may be.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.324
Probably shagging.

04:49.409 --> 04:51.703
But, uh, no. Um, seriously, Nat.

04:51.787 --> 04:53.913
You're a real eight out of ten, love.
I mean that sincerely.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.624
And we're delighted you and Josh
have found each other.

04:56.709 --> 04:58.710
So, everyone, please, raise your glasses

04:59.128 --> 05:01.546
as we say a little toast to Nat and Josh.

05:01.755 --> 05:03.715
To Nat and Josh!

05:09.138 --> 05:10.722
Nat is literally gonna
be cringing right now.

05:10.806 --> 05:13.141
She hates being the centre of attention.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.852
It is impossible to imagine anyone

05:15.936 --> 05:18.771
looking more beautiful
than you do today, Nat.

05:18.856 --> 05:21.149
And I know how much you love
being the centre of attention.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.860
That's just one of the things
that makes us so different.

05:23.153 --> 05:24.570
Because I'm a thinker, you're a doer.

05:25.071 --> 05:27.240
I'm laissez-faire, you're anal.

05:27.325 --> 05:28.366
Hey, you dirty sod!

05:29.327 --> 05:30.410
On you go.

05:30.495 --> 05:32.287
I think it's fine for a man to wear Crocs,

05:32.371 --> 05:35.081
and you've made it abundantly
clear you do not.

05:36.709 --> 05:37.751
I know it's only been seven months,

05:37.835 --> 05:41.963
and some of you think that we're crazy
for getting married, but...

05:42.632 --> 05:47.135
all I know is, from the
first moment I saw you,

05:47.220 --> 05:49.846
I knew that yours was the only face

05:50.640 --> 05:51.890
and the only voice...

05:52.517 --> 05:55.143
- that I would ever need again.
- Aw!

05:55.228 --> 05:56.853
'Cause in that moment,
everything just changed.

05:56.938 --> 06:00.148
Everything just seemed to fit so perfectly.

06:00.233 --> 06:01.776
Wahey!

06:02.361 --> 06:05.197
And I'm so lucky that I feel like
I'm only just getting to know you.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.910
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:10.662 --> 06:11.787
here's to us.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.415
- Here's to us.
- Cheers!

06:38.190 --> 06:39.774
Are you happy?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.568
The happiest.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.364
The best two hours and
36 minutes of my life.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.954
You know, I had this terrible fear

06:52.038 --> 06:55.416
that you were gonna
do some sort of novelty dance.

07:03.592 --> 07:05.926
Get it on quickly, get it on quickly.
I'm so sorry, Nat.

07:39.338 --> 07:41.255
- You can't say those things.
- Don't be a player hater.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.466
Seriously, mate.
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

07:43.592 --> 07:44.634
Am I right? Put it there, mate.

07:48.723 --> 07:50.432
- Ready?
- Yeah.

08:08.285 --> 08:10.411
Aw. That's nice.

08:14.124 --> 08:17.126
Listen, son, you know
it's not easy, don't you?

08:17.836 --> 08:20.755
- The first year is the worst.
- Okay.

08:20.839 --> 08:22.256
- It's true.
- Thank you.

08:22.341 --> 08:24.093
If you can make it through
the first year of marriage,

08:24.177 --> 08:26.887
- you can make it through anything.
- Yeah.

08:27.597 --> 08:29.932
You know, there were times
when your father was late home

08:30.016 --> 08:32.768
- I used to fantasise he'd been killed.
- Did you?

08:32.852 --> 08:34.186
- Mmm.
- That's nice.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.105
Oh, in my mind, it was always the IRA.

08:36.356 --> 08:37.731
Strange, strange.

08:37.774 --> 08:39.942
But things got better
because we love each other.

08:40.318 --> 08:42.236
Tremendous, tremendous.

08:51.038 --> 08:53.039
- Shall we go, yeah? This is weird.
- Yes, it's a bit weird.

08:58.254 --> 09:00.214
Unbelievable. Just unbelievable.

09:09.391 --> 09:12.059
- So, that was nine months ago.
- Mmm.

09:12.561 --> 09:16.313
And I think even then we knew instinctively

09:16.398 --> 09:17.690
something wasn't quite right.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.900
You realised you'd married beneath yourself.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.570
You thought you could be
with someone better-looking,

09:22.696 --> 09:25.322
better body, perhaps a professional man?

09:25.407 --> 09:26.992
- Uh, no.
- No.

09:27.076 --> 09:31.872
No, no, I think we were both in love
with the idea of being in love.

09:32.874 --> 09:37.003
You know, and we're at that age
where we're ready to find "the one".

09:37.087 --> 09:39.505
And don't tell me, Josh,
you opened that closet door,

09:39.590 --> 09:40.882
didn't want to live that lie any more.

09:41.133 --> 09:42.633
I picked up on it the moment you sat down.

09:42.718 --> 09:45.261
Tricks of the trade.
You know, you can tell by the shoes.

09:46.472 --> 09:49.474
No! Oh, Christ, no, no, no, no,
I'm completely straight.

09:49.892 --> 09:51.559
Couldn't be less gay.
I mean, I don't even like...

09:51.643 --> 09:53.394
touching my own penis.

09:56.273 --> 09:58.316
Right, so were there terrible
sexual problems?

09:58.525 --> 10:01.152
Does he have tremendously niche desires?

10:01.612 --> 10:02.820
Did he want to touch you here?

10:06.116 --> 10:07.951
- Uh...
- Never with a pen.

10:10.288 --> 10:12.582
Look, Nat's amazing, obviously.
She's wonderful.

10:12.666 --> 10:14.793
And I think we both really want
to make this work.

10:14.877 --> 10:15.919
But is it possible

10:16.003 --> 10:18.379
that some people
just aren't supposed to be married?

10:18.464 --> 10:20.632
Truthfully, there's just something
in our marriage

10:20.716 --> 10:22.258
that hasn't quite...

10:22.343 --> 10:24.177
- Clicked.
...jelled.

10:30.851 --> 10:32.477
So? Was it like a dream?

10:32.561 --> 10:34.854
Well, we ticked every wedding box.

10:34.939 --> 10:37.774
Cake, sweaty uncles dancing to Queen.

10:37.858 --> 10:40.568
People we thought were dead
flying in from Canada.

10:40.653 --> 10:42.570
It was very wedding-y, right?

10:42.655 --> 10:43.988
It was so romantic.

10:44.073 --> 10:45.406
It was just like a Hugh Grant film.

10:45.616 --> 10:47.619
- It was amazing, wasn't it?
- Mmm!

10:47.703 --> 10:49.496
Did you like all the flowers?
We got the most...

10:49.580 --> 10:50.831
I'm sorry,

10:51.123 --> 10:52.749
but can we do this at lunch?

10:53.167 --> 10:54.793
- Right. Absolutely, Helen.
- Thanks.

10:54.877 --> 10:56.837
Ruthlessly efficient, as always.

10:56.921 --> 10:57.963
We should not be talking about

10:58.047 --> 10:59.923
- lace halter necks on company time.
- No.

11:00.925 --> 11:04.010
- What's the story?
- While you were on your holiday,

11:04.178 --> 11:05.387
I took the initiative

11:05.513 --> 11:07.722
and I started gathering
ideas for Guy Harrap.

11:08.099 --> 11:11.518
He's taken over his father's
industrial solvent and bleach empire.

11:11.602 --> 11:16.398
You weren't here, but he basically wants
to make solvents and bleach sexy.

11:16.482 --> 11:18.441
Fuck off.

11:20.611 --> 11:23.114
Is that my dirty little slut of a wife?

11:23.991 --> 11:24.991
Hey!

11:25.075 --> 11:26.325
What are you doing?

11:26.410 --> 11:28.287
Uh, middle of a meeting. What's up?

11:28.496 --> 11:31.456
Maybe I'm just missing
the sexiest wife in the universe.

11:31.541 --> 11:34.751
- Not working today?
- I've got writer's block.

11:35.169 --> 11:39.131
I can't work out whether to call
my main character Ezra

11:39.382 --> 11:41.967
- or David.
- Um, David.

11:42.051 --> 11:43.719
I was at school with an
Ezra who got expelled

11:43.803 --> 11:45.137
for punching a swan in the throat.

11:45.221 --> 11:47.055
Who said the second novel would be tricky?

11:48.099 --> 11:49.141
Anything else?

11:49.225 --> 11:51.977
No, no, no. I'll see you at three.

11:52.061 --> 11:53.562
Love...

11:54.147 --> 11:55.230
...you.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.984
Sorry, that was my husband.

11:58.068 --> 11:59.527
He has writer's block.

11:59.612 --> 12:01.487
Did I mention that he
was a writer, of books?

12:01.572 --> 12:03.615
- Only about a million times.
- Yeah, Clare mentioned it,

12:03.699 --> 12:05.867
but I've never heard of him.

12:10.290 --> 12:11.332
Sorry, sorry.

12:11.416 --> 12:13.667
You do realise you're not going
any faster than walking, don't you?

12:13.752 --> 12:15.836
You've got all the superficial
trappings of a run

12:15.921 --> 12:18.088
but there's people walking
much faster than you.

12:18.214 --> 12:20.424
You're just expending
a lot of surplus energy.

12:20.592 --> 12:22.593
Thank you for that analysis.

12:22.677 --> 12:23.969
How late are we?

12:24.054 --> 12:27.139
Well, you, my little friend,
are 10 minutes early.

12:27.223 --> 12:29.934
I told you the wrong time because I knew
you'd never be on schedule.

12:30.602 --> 12:32.686
- Right.
- Mmm!

12:32.771 --> 12:35.649
I'm just trying to work out
if I find that endearing

12:35.733 --> 12:39.277
or it makes me want to bludgeon you
to death with a shovel.

12:39.362 --> 12:41.029
- No, it's endearing.
- I think it's a shovel.

12:41.113 --> 12:43.281
- It's endearing.
- Do we have a shovel?

12:43.366 --> 12:46.618
Well, firstly, a hearty "mazoltov"
for your marriage.

12:47.453 --> 12:48.621
- I think it's "mazel tov", isn't it?
- Thank you.

12:48.956 --> 12:50.748
- Mmm?
- I always thought it was "mazel tov".

12:50.916 --> 12:52.291
I don't know, I'm not Jewish.

12:52.709 --> 12:53.751
Oh.

12:54.419 --> 12:58.965
But, as you know, whilst everything
may seem so happy now,

12:59.049 --> 13:01.384
of course you could be
struck down at any time.

13:01.468 --> 13:05.429
Cancer. Heart disease. Meningitis.

13:05.555 --> 13:07.181
Hit by a truck.

13:07.265 --> 13:08.684
Bam!

13:09.477 --> 13:13.438
I had a client who was kicked to death
by a group of disaffected youths

13:13.523 --> 13:14.898
high on meow meow.

13:14.983 --> 13:17.150
She'd just left the house to get potatoes.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.820
- Just potatoes.
- Shit.

13:19.904 --> 13:21.154
And the tragedy was,

13:21.239 --> 13:23.031
she hadn't thought to make a will.

13:23.616 --> 13:25.784
Or a Tesco home delivery.

13:25.868 --> 13:26.994
What?

13:27.870 --> 13:28.997
Yeah.

13:29.665 --> 13:32.333
She was only identifiable
by her dental records.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.836
Why, what had they done to her?

13:34.920 --> 13:36.671
They'd made impressions of her teeth.

13:38.716 --> 13:40.633
Still, fortunately, you two have had
the presence of mind

13:40.718 --> 13:41.759
to plan for your future.

13:41.969 --> 13:44.221
So, have you considered what would happen

13:44.305 --> 13:46.724
if either of you fell into a persistent...

13:46.808 --> 13:49.476
- ... vegetatative state?
- A what, sorry?

13:49.561 --> 13:51.478
Persistent vegetatative state.

13:51.563 --> 13:54.231
Mmm. One too many
T's there. "Vegetative."

13:57.027 --> 13:59.820
Have you considered what would happen
if you fell into...

13:59.904 --> 14:00.988
one of these guys?

14:01.740 --> 14:03.741
Just pillow talk, really.

14:05.035 --> 14:07.119
No, I think we did decide
that we'd both like to be left to die.

14:07.370 --> 14:09.789
Excellent, yes.
We just switched off my aunt.

14:09.832 --> 14:11.416
- I'm sorry.
- Aw.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.501
No, it's all right.
It's no quality of life.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.170
And we freed up a socket for a lava lamp.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.463
Ah.

14:16.547 --> 14:17.630
It's transformed the lounge.

14:17.715 --> 14:18.757
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:18.841 --> 14:20.134
Largely losing her, to be fair.

14:21.511 --> 14:24.472
Now, can we go through a few of these?
Just give me a yes or no.

14:24.556 --> 14:27.558
Are we switching the life support off?

14:27.642 --> 14:28.684
Brain dead?

14:29.770 --> 14:32.438
- Switch it off.
- Switch it off. Get it off.

14:33.148 --> 14:34.565
Locked-in syndrome?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.276
That's the one where you're paralysed
but you can still wink.

14:37.903 --> 14:39.111
It's all the...

14:39.738 --> 14:41.989
It's the dribble, isn't it,
that I couldn't handle.

14:42.074 --> 14:44.450
- Constantly mopping up phlegm.
- I wouldn't want that.

14:44.534 --> 14:46.410
You wouldn't want that.
That's why you're murdering your wife.

14:47.579 --> 14:48.662
So, are you switching it off?

14:48.747 --> 14:49.956
- Sorry, what are you doing?
- Off!

14:50.041 --> 14:51.333
- Switch it off, yeah.
- Off she goes!

14:51.417 --> 14:53.126
Night-night.

14:53.753 --> 14:57.465
Um, brain-damaged and vegetative.

14:57.549 --> 14:59.050
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

14:59.426 --> 15:00.968
Um, brain stem undamaged.

15:01.053 --> 15:03.930
So you're breathing,
you're swallowing, you're fine,

15:04.014 --> 15:07.016
but you are still literally
a shell of a person

15:07.101 --> 15:10.770
with no capacity for any emotion or thought.

15:11.730 --> 15:13.564
Much like my Susan.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.441
My little joke.

15:17.986 --> 15:19.821
- Off, off.
- Off, yeah, off.

15:19.905 --> 15:23.783
Get that off, off, off, off!

15:25.327 --> 15:26.619
Well, this is slightly more depressing

15:26.703 --> 15:27.870
- than I'd imagined.
- Oh, no. Come one.

15:27.955 --> 15:30.164
And you haven't even received my bill yet.

15:31.919 --> 15:33.336
That's a good 'un. That is a good 'un.

15:40.344 --> 15:42.846
An electric peppermill?

15:42.930 --> 15:44.764
I can't believe you got
an electric peppermill.

15:45.516 --> 15:47.684
We thought we had to have
at least one dinner party

15:47.768 --> 15:49.435
to use all the crap we got bought.

15:50.229 --> 15:51.563
At least that's a useful gift.

15:51.772 --> 15:53.565
D'you know what I mean?
I hate those gifts where someone says,

15:53.649 --> 15:54.691
"Do you know what I've done for you?

15:54.775 --> 15:56.151
"I've donated to charity
on your behalf."

15:56.235 --> 15:58.069
"Have you? Really?" Bollocks to that.

15:58.154 --> 16:00.655
If I'm getting married, why should some
African fella get a couple of goats?

16:00.739 --> 16:02.282
I want a fucking smoothie maker,
d'you know what I mean?

16:05.077 --> 16:07.413
- Did you get them goats?
- Four of them.

16:07.497 --> 16:08.539
- Four goats?
- Yeah.

16:08.623 --> 16:10.166
That's a lovely gift, that,
because they need goats.

16:12.253 --> 16:13.670
African fella's pleased.

16:14.630 --> 16:17.299
Go on, tell us about your honeymoon.

16:17.466 --> 16:20.010
It was lovely. It was idyllic.

16:20.094 --> 16:21.386
Morocco's beautiful.

16:21.470 --> 16:22.804
- Amazing place, yeah.
- Yeah.

16:22.889 --> 16:24.181
It was just a bit long, really.

16:24.265 --> 16:25.265
I was really sad when we came back.

16:25.349 --> 16:27.851
Well, things hit a low point
when we found ourselves

16:27.935 --> 16:30.103
in the Essaouira Museum
of Leather Manufacturing

16:30.730 --> 16:33.273
discussing if we had a superpower,
what would it be?

16:33.357 --> 16:36.359
I actually really enjoyed that.
I thought that was really fun.

16:36.444 --> 16:37.944
I think if I was gonna have any superpower,

16:38.154 --> 16:39.779
it would be the ability to speak Spanish.

16:39.906 --> 16:42.158
That would be amazing, wouldn't it?
Because you could say stuff like,

16:42.242 --> 16:44.785
- Hola, gazpacho.
- You just said it.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.370
- You're saying it now.
- Oh, wow.

16:46.455 --> 16:47.872
Hmm.

16:47.956 --> 16:50.291
Not strictly speaking a superpower,
though, is it, really?

16:50.375 --> 16:52.127
Otherwise everyone in Brazil
would be superheroes.

16:52.670 --> 16:53.754
Mmm, true.

16:54.130 --> 16:55.589
They speak Portuguese in Brazil.

16:56.674 --> 16:57.674
You cock.

17:00.011 --> 17:01.929
- Mmm?
- Keep it for the car.

17:02.013 --> 17:04.263
Um, so... Wait, so, Josh,

17:04.348 --> 17:06.266
- what did you choose?
- Boring, really. Super-strength.

17:06.351 --> 17:08.018
That's what I would choose, too!

17:08.269 --> 17:11.230
I think it would be so handy
to be able to open, like, jam jars.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.440
Jam jars! That's exactly...
Isn't that exactly what I said?

17:13.523 --> 17:15.943
- That's exactly what you said.
- That's exactly what I said.

17:16.027 --> 17:17.069
- That's so funny.
- That is so funny.

17:17.153 --> 17:19.906
Are we eight years old, all of a sudden?
This is what children talk about.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.449
All right, Nat, calm down,
we were only having a joke.

17:21.532 --> 17:22.700
Yeah, joke's over.

17:22.785 --> 17:25.286
Ooh. "Grounds for divorce dot com."

17:26.038 --> 17:29.499
Shut up, you "bell-end dot-co-dot-uk".

17:30.834 --> 17:32.419
To be honest, I'm not sure
you could get a divorce

17:32.504 --> 17:34.129
because I'm not even sure
you're officially married.

17:34.214 --> 17:35.464
Because they never officially split up.

17:39.552 --> 17:40.803
- What?
- What?

17:40.887 --> 17:42.054
They never officially split up.

17:42.138 --> 17:43.389
What are you talking about?

17:44.140 --> 17:47.017
You never officially broke up, did you?

17:47.394 --> 17:51.939
Yeah, actually it's, um...
it's pretty funny, really,

17:52.023 --> 17:56.152
because, um, when I left for Africa,

17:56.237 --> 17:57.904
we sort of never formally ended it.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.030
Never formal.

18:01.075 --> 18:03.201
We just sort of... We left it open.

18:03.286 --> 18:04.411
Wide open.

18:04.495 --> 18:05.704
Then I ended up being gone for four years.

18:05.788 --> 18:08.206
- About four years...
- But what's four years, really?

18:13.588 --> 18:14.755
I've told you this.

18:15.924 --> 18:18.843
- Nat. Nat.
- Hmm?

18:18.927 --> 18:20.094
I've told you this.

18:22.764 --> 18:24.682
He wasn't happy, though,
I'll tell you, that time.

18:24.766 --> 18:28.185
Honestly, we used to refer to 2008
as the sort of... as the "lost year".

18:28.270 --> 18:30.355
- Mate.
- He would just sit there in his pants.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.150
You know, drinking and playing
Grand Theft Auto, masturbating.

18:33.276 --> 18:34.443
No!

18:34.527 --> 18:36.570
Sometimes all three at once.

18:36.654 --> 18:37.904
That's an impressive thing.
I couldn't do that.

18:37.989 --> 18:39.656
I could practise for ages,
I wouldn't be able to do that.

18:39.741 --> 18:40.782
Imagine that on Britain's Got Talent.

18:44.203 --> 18:48.332
Nat, I'm really sorry
about that, back there.

18:48.416 --> 18:49.624
I just... I thought that you knew.

18:49.709 --> 18:52.711
Oh, no, don't be silly.
It was years ago.

18:52.795 --> 18:55.923
2008, I was still using
"LOL" un-ironically

18:56.008 --> 18:57.050
and wearing ballet flats.

18:59.636 --> 19:01.929
Look at those.
You look really cute in those.

19:02.014 --> 19:04.140
- Thanks, thanks.
- Pretty.

19:04.809 --> 19:06.143
Um...

19:06.227 --> 19:08.645
Yeah, well, you know,
it really was a long time ago

19:08.730 --> 19:10.147
and we were both so young.

19:10.231 --> 19:12.274
We were so different back then.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.110
And now he's married
to the coolest woman on the planet.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.487
You're sweet.

19:16.571 --> 19:19.156
I thought,
"I've got it made, I married a doctor."

19:19.491 --> 19:21.241
And then you realise,
you're gonna wake up every day

19:21.326 --> 19:22.826
to the same hairy ears.

19:23.995 --> 19:26.330
The same slightly deformed fungal toenail.

19:26.414 --> 19:27.998
And you're gonna have
to listen to that weird,

19:28.083 --> 19:29.917
ear-throat-clearing sound they make

19:30.001 --> 19:31.377
every day until you are dead.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.841
And the same penis.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.305
I may, literally, never
see another penis again.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.349
Unless it's a small child's.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.395
Or if you get sexually assaulted.

19:54.986 --> 19:58.489
And Josh's is lovely. You know,
we have an incredible sex life.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.741
But that's not the point, you know.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.785
I love Michael Jackson's Off the Wall album.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.830
I wouldn't necessarily want to only
listen to that for the rest of my life.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.040
Yeah. Oh, honey, I've been there.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.626
I mean, you'll listen to it a lot
in the beginning.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.086
You'll listen to it
in all different sorts of places.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.047
You'll listen to it in the car,

20:14.132 --> 20:15.883
in the disabled toilet cubicle
in the McDonald's in Egham,

20:17.386 --> 20:19.303
in your unconscious granny's hospital room.

20:20.139 --> 20:22.473
- Granny Mary?
- It's what she would have wanted.

20:23.851 --> 20:24.976
But then, you know,

20:25.060 --> 20:26.144
you're just gonna get to the point

20:26.228 --> 20:28.146
where you're not that bothered
about listening to music at all.

20:28.689 --> 20:30.773
You just play it on birthdays,

20:30.858 --> 20:33.234
or when you're very, very drunk.

20:33.694 --> 20:34.777
Or...

20:35.946 --> 20:37.613
if someone shows you a Justin Bieber video

20:37.698 --> 20:38.865
when you're in the office

20:38.949 --> 20:42.743
and, you know, all you can
then think about is that.

20:44.830 --> 20:46.789
Isn't he, like, 15?

20:47.249 --> 20:48.833
Oh, he'd know what to do.

20:50.752 --> 20:52.921
I'd ruin Bieber.

20:53.381 --> 20:56.426
You would. You would ruin him.

20:58.846 --> 21:01.347
Fuck.
It's the soundtrack to my marriage.

21:01.432 --> 21:03.349
Don't get married, you.
Too late for you.

21:07.605 --> 21:09.147
Penny for them.

21:10.024 --> 21:12.358
Your thoughts. How you doing?

21:12.443 --> 21:13.860
Hey, Danny.

21:19.617 --> 21:21.326
Let's get the party started.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.453
Get comfy. Get comfy.

21:37.803 --> 21:40.263
You know, I shouldn't really tell you
this, but I was talking to Josh...

21:40.348 --> 21:42.015
...and, um,

21:42.475 --> 21:45.894
he said that the sex between him and Nat

21:45.978 --> 21:47.270
is amazing.

21:47.355 --> 21:49.898
He said that it blows everything
he's had in the past out the water.

21:49.982 --> 21:51.191
Out of the water!

21:51.275 --> 21:54.945
- Wow. That is tremendous news.
- Tremendous news for him,

21:55.029 --> 21:56.321
- he's really pleased, yeah.
- It's... Yeah.

21:57.782 --> 21:59.991
I suppose that's not really your thing,
is it? Sex and sexiness.

22:00.159 --> 22:02.369
You're more...
How would you describe yourself?

22:03.121 --> 22:05.665
Kind of "kind," do you know what I mean?
Charitable.

22:07.334 --> 22:09.627
It's a shame, in a way,
that they couldn't put...

22:09.711 --> 22:13.256
your brain in her body. D'you know
what I mean? That would be amazing.

22:13.340 --> 22:15.299
Although what would you be left with?
You'd be left with, like...

22:15.384 --> 22:16.635
Ooh, you'd be left with
her brain in your body.

22:16.719 --> 22:19.763
Imagine that.
Just rampaging around, out of control.

22:19.847 --> 22:22.182
"What's that?

22:22.267 --> 22:23.392
"Oh, my God, it's like Frankenstein,

22:23.476 --> 22:25.852
"but with, like, boobs."

22:25.937 --> 22:29.189
Villagers coming out
with pitchforks and torches. "Kill it!"

22:30.024 --> 22:32.734
- It'd be just terrifying.
- It would be terrifying.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.695
It would be horrible.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.531
No. Joking, joking. I'd do you.

22:38.701 --> 22:41.244
- If you wanted. You know.
- Thank you.

22:41.328 --> 22:45.373
If I had to make a top-10
of women I know that I would do,

22:45.916 --> 22:47.500
you'd be in that list.

22:47.585 --> 22:49.586
Number seven. All right?

22:49.670 --> 22:51.504
- Thank you. Thanks, Danny.
- Seriously.

22:52.548 --> 22:55.633
Do you want to get a drink sometime?
Maybe pop out and get a drink sometime?

22:55.759 --> 22:57.678
Um, I... No.

22:57.762 --> 23:00.055
- Yeah?
- No.

23:00.140 --> 23:01.599
You say no, I say yes.

23:04.060 --> 23:06.270
So, remember to play up
our ethical credentials.

23:06.354 --> 23:08.022
Don't mention the BP campaign.

23:08.106 --> 23:11.233
And let's emphasise the online campaign
we did for Greenpeace.

23:11.318 --> 23:12.484
Our job is to convince people

23:12.569 --> 23:14.654
his solvents won't render the planet
a barren, lifeless husk

23:14.739 --> 23:17.198
- unfit for future generations.
- Piece of piss.

23:17.283 --> 23:18.491
How are we gonna do that, then?

23:18.576 --> 23:20.410
Well, if he's a cheapskate like his dad,

23:20.536 --> 23:22.579
we suggest making the
typeface green and yellow

23:22.663 --> 23:25.999
and sticking some sort of
sunflower or butterfly on the logo.

23:26.083 --> 23:27.125
It's textbook.

23:27.543 --> 23:29.044
Depressingly, you could be right.

23:30.004 --> 23:32.380
I expect he'll be some
sort of tasteless Yank,

23:32.465 --> 23:34.382
obsessed with how we're all so quaint,

23:34.467 --> 23:35.967
spell "colour" with a "u",

23:36.052 --> 23:39.764
worship Benny Hill and then
say "awesome" a lot.

23:39.890 --> 23:42.308
Yeah. And he'll probably do
that Austin Powers accent.

23:42.392 --> 23:43.809
You know the one. "Yeah, baby!"

23:45.020 --> 23:46.020
I didn't watch that film

23:46.104 --> 23:47.647
because it's absolutely not my cup of tea.

23:47.731 --> 23:50.484
And then plump for whatever
turns out to be the cheapest option.

23:50.568 --> 23:51.610
That's my prediction.

23:53.821 --> 23:56.782
- You're not eating today?
- There's a lot of mercury in that.

23:57.116 --> 23:58.367
Then why don't you get a fucking sandwich?

23:58.451 --> 24:00.035
I am gonna get a fucking sandwich, Clare,

24:00.119 --> 24:01.203
but I'm not gonna have one with bread in it

24:01.287 --> 24:02.871
because I'm a coeliac. You know that.

24:03.665 --> 24:05.290
So I was thinking about your book.

24:05.375 --> 24:06.833
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:06.918 --> 24:10.462
I reckon that I prefer
"Ezra" to "David" as a name.

24:11.047 --> 24:14.216
There was a David at school who,
if you paid him 50 cents,

24:14.300 --> 24:16.051
was prepared to lick anything.

24:16.135 --> 24:18.137
- Literally anything.
- Let's talk about it over dinner

24:18.222 --> 24:21.057
because Nat's out tonight,
another work thing.

24:21.100 --> 24:22.558
I'm starving.

24:23.435 --> 24:25.229
I mean, obviously, it's all relative.

24:25.313 --> 24:26.647
I feel their plight.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.524
I only had a Kinder Bueno for lunch.

24:28.608 --> 24:30.901
Mmm, I can't tonight.
I'm going out with Charlie.

24:31.194 --> 24:34.113
What, again?
That's the third time in two weeks.

24:34.322 --> 24:36.073
You're counting?

24:36.116 --> 24:37.366
Sorry to interrupt.

24:37.450 --> 24:38.992
Those articles you wanted from this morning.

24:39.077 --> 24:40.786
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

24:42.288 --> 24:44.039
So, what, am I just supposed to stay home

24:44.124 --> 24:45.541
in the hopes you've got a free night?

24:45.625 --> 24:46.875
No.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.711
I just don't want to see you
getting hurt, that's all.

24:52.173 --> 24:53.590
Is that him?

24:53.842 --> 24:54.967
Yeah.

24:55.051 --> 24:58.054
Well, I see someone managed
to find a Burger King out in Sudan.

25:06.732 --> 25:08.524
I've just seen Guy Harrap in reception!

25:08.608 --> 25:11.110
And I would jump on him
like a bouncy castle.

25:11.194 --> 25:12.653
Remember to take off your shoes,
and no somersaults.

25:12.738 --> 25:14.238
- I need your ring.
- What?

25:14.322 --> 25:15.906
- We really need this account.
- Are you on drugs?

25:16.032 --> 25:18.284
Come on, it's not like you're gonna
jump into bed with the man.

25:18.368 --> 25:19.618
Clare!

25:19.703 --> 25:20.786
What's up?

25:21.872 --> 25:23.497
- Guy Harrap.
- Hello.

25:23.582 --> 25:24.665
Who we got here?

25:25.041 --> 25:27.084
Natasha Redfearn, Accounts Director.

25:27.169 --> 25:28.169
- Sweet.
- Hi.

25:28.253 --> 25:29.920
Is there anything we can offer you?

25:30.005 --> 25:33.007
Hot diggity dog, I love
the way you say that.

25:33.091 --> 25:34.759
Huh? The way she says that? "Offer"?

25:34.843 --> 25:36.344
Off... Can you say that again?

25:36.429 --> 25:37.971
- Oh...
- "Offer" me.

25:38.390 --> 25:39.599
Um, offer.

25:39.683 --> 25:41.225
There it is. There it is.

25:41.310 --> 25:42.393
- Here, give me some of that.
- Oh.

25:42.478 --> 25:44.437
- All right. Pound it.
- Yes. Oh.

25:44.897 --> 25:47.398
I got an idea. Let's sit down,
let's talk some business. Huh?

25:48.066 --> 25:50.777
Mr Harrap, we're delighted
that you've come to us

25:50.861 --> 25:52.445
to take Harraps Solvents forward

25:52.571 --> 25:55.573
and rebrand in the fresh challenges
presented by the new media climate.

25:55.949 --> 25:58.451
Awesome. Totally awesome. Bingo, huh?

25:59.953 --> 26:02.038
We're very pleased with some of the concepts

26:02.122 --> 26:03.873
we've come up with
for the new incarnation of Harraps.

26:03.957 --> 26:07.668
Yeah, as long as you don't fob me off
with some yellow-and-green font.

26:08.295 --> 26:10.505
I mean, how many times
have we seen that, right?

26:10.589 --> 26:12.049
Yes, exactly. No.

26:12.342 --> 26:13.550
Too many! Far...

26:13.635 --> 26:16.553
What we were pla...
What we were thinking is to take...

26:18.556 --> 26:21.100
- a holistic approach...
- Mmm-hmm.

26:21.977 --> 26:26.064
...focusing on the core brand values
of integrity...

26:26.148 --> 26:27.190
Integrity.

26:27.691 --> 26:28.942
Got it. Thank you.

26:29.068 --> 26:30.819
...responsibility...

26:36.575 --> 26:38.409
- that epitomise...
- Mmm.

26:38.577 --> 26:40.745
...what Harraps stands for.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.831
Harraps. That's very good.

26:46.126 --> 26:50.464
Well, to be honest, at Oxford,
my economics professor

26:50.549 --> 26:53.300
favoured a fully integrated
four-quadrant strategy

26:53.426 --> 26:55.761
cohesive across all media,

26:55.846 --> 26:58.013
presenting an instantly accessible,

26:58.098 --> 27:00.851
aesthetic, philosophical
and commercial identity

27:00.935 --> 27:04.312
consistent with an ethical
contemporary market leader

27:04.397 --> 27:08.316
whilst embracing its legacy of integrity.

27:08.484 --> 27:09.526
Yeah, baby!

27:09.610 --> 27:11.278
That's Austin Powers.

27:12.405 --> 27:14.281
I love that film.

27:14.448 --> 27:17.117
- I'm so sorry, I just...
- I know.

27:17.201 --> 27:22.080
You thought I was a tasteless Yank
obsessed with how quaint you all are.

27:22.164 --> 27:24.250
That's so quaint.

27:24.334 --> 27:26.460
It's incredibly embarrassing.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.671
But we have plenty of
other proposals to show you.

27:28.755 --> 27:32.133
No, I don't need to see them.
These things aren't done in boardrooms.

27:32.801 --> 27:35.386
We should get to know
each other, Miss Redfearn.

27:35.470 --> 27:37.805
A holistic approach, as you say.

27:40.268 --> 27:42.185
Well, agreed, but, uh,

27:42.270 --> 27:45.439
but from the outset, you should
know that I've just got, um...

27:52.405 --> 27:55.824
another account that I have to focus on
for the next few days.

27:56.284 --> 27:57.951
- It's been a pleasure.
- Thanks.

27:58.287 --> 28:00.288
- I'm so sorry again for the...
- No, please.

28:00.372 --> 28:03.708
Bye.

28:14.094 --> 28:18.765
When we first met, I just thought
Josh was exactly what I needed.

28:18.849 --> 28:20.351
You know, I felt...

28:20.435 --> 28:23.228
so safe, and then...

28:26.107 --> 28:27.358
I think what she's trying to say is,

28:27.442 --> 28:29.401
is that the everyday reality of marriage

28:29.486 --> 28:31.403
started to overtake the fairytale,

28:31.488 --> 28:33.781
- the fantasy, right?
- Ooh, hark at you.

28:34.075 --> 28:36.534
Somebody swallowed
a copy of Eat, Pray, Love.

28:36.827 --> 28:39.788
No, I think as... we...

28:41.415 --> 28:43.041
I'm gonna have to take this.

28:44.251 --> 28:45.293
Yep, fine, I'm in a session.

28:47.129 --> 28:49.047
Can't you pick them up?

28:49.882 --> 28:51.257
Give me two minutes.

28:51.342 --> 28:53.718
Talk about your feelings
or your father or something.

29:04.564 --> 29:07.233
Coming up on Cash in the Attic,

29:07.317 --> 29:10.195
a delightful silver brooch
made by a celebrated war hero.

29:10.989 --> 29:12.572
The bin's full.

29:13.282 --> 29:14.866
- Can you take it out?
- Yeah.

29:15.368 --> 29:18.036
The One Tree Hill omnibus is about to start.

29:18.121 --> 29:21.123
Lauren's about to tell Jake
that baby Connor's not his.

29:27.422 --> 29:31.758
Oh, Christ.
Your husband is so adorable.

29:36.014 --> 29:38.140
Yes. He really is.

29:38.224 --> 29:40.100
So ostentatious.

29:43.022 --> 29:44.564
Have you seen my phone?

29:44.648 --> 29:46.942
No. When did you last have it?

29:47.068 --> 29:49.153
Well, if I knew that,
it wouldn't be lost, would it?

29:49.237 --> 29:51.155
That's the point of something being lost.

29:54.117 --> 29:55.617
You're always here.

29:56.453 --> 29:58.370
Why are you always here?

30:02.667 --> 30:04.960
Come and have a look at this video
of a monkey fucking a bullfrog.

30:06.963 --> 30:08.505
He's killed it!

30:09.424 --> 30:10.799
He's killed it by fucking it!

30:31.073 --> 30:33.491
Seriously, Nat.
Seriously, hang on a sec.

30:33.575 --> 30:35.951
Why do you never get the
words to a song right?

30:37.662 --> 30:38.913
Does it really matter?

30:38.997 --> 30:41.749
What, "I've travelled the world
in generic jeans"?

30:41.833 --> 30:43.501
Really? Come on.

30:44.127 --> 30:47.338
I was just singing.
Didn't realise it was so important.

30:47.464 --> 30:49.298
Do you really think that
Annie Lennox is singing about

30:49.382 --> 30:51.926
whether she happened to travel
the world in Levis or Wranglers?

30:54.096 --> 30:55.763
Okay. Wow.

30:58.392 --> 31:00.268
And while we're at it,
Elton John isn't singing,

31:00.353 --> 31:02.605
"Hold me close and
tie me down, sir."

31:02.689 --> 31:05.900
Kurt Cobain isn't singing,
"Here we are now in containers."

31:05.984 --> 31:09.195
If you can't sing it right,
don't sing at all. It's idiotic.

31:10.030 --> 31:12.240
Says the man dressed as a pea.

31:20.249 --> 31:24.085
I can't believe we're having
the same fucking row!

31:25.129 --> 31:28.214
Oh! Not listening!
Not listening! Not listening!

31:28.882 --> 31:30.258
No! Fuck you!

31:30.342 --> 31:34.304
Oh, my God, you're such an arsehole!

31:34.389 --> 31:36.640
Yes, you are!
You are such a cock-sucking,

31:36.724 --> 31:39.226
shit-stabbing, fucking arsehole!

31:39.310 --> 31:43.273
I could just fucking stab
you right in the eyes!

31:44.233 --> 31:46.109
What the fuck are you looking at?

31:46.193 --> 31:47.819
You could do with a fuck!

31:48.362 --> 31:50.196
No, not you! Nobody wants to fuck you!

31:50.281 --> 31:52.615
You fucking frigid arsehole!

31:53.075 --> 31:54.742
Yeah, fuck you!

31:59.290 --> 32:00.623
So, here we are.

32:01.208 --> 32:03.418
The hub of the Harraps empire.

32:04.753 --> 32:06.087
What do you think?

32:06.547 --> 32:08.799
Hopefully, you can see why I wanted you
to check this place out.

32:08.925 --> 32:13.721
It's state-of-the-art and responsible
for a turnover last year of 37 million.

32:13.763 --> 32:19.560
If you squirted air from a large space
into a slightly smaller space last year,

32:19.603 --> 32:22.605
chances are you did it through one of these.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.442
Every time I squirt out a little bit of air,

32:25.484 --> 32:27.152
I'll think of you.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.282
That sounded weird,
but you know what I mean.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.618
Yeah, sure.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.915
There's someone I want you to meet.

32:39.957 --> 32:43.461
Janet's been working here
for, what, 42 years?

32:43.587 --> 32:45.755
Forty-three in June. Hello.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.967
Yep, my grandfather exploited her,
my father exploited her,

32:50.010 --> 32:51.135
now I get to exploit her.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.764
He's a good lad, this one.
He takes care of us.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.975
You won't find anybody here
with a bad word to say about him.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.143
Except Sarah.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.979
But she's a proper shithouse.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.272
Really?

33:03.523 --> 33:06.151
He just needs to settle down,
start a family.

33:06.444 --> 33:08.153
So, what do you think?

33:08.321 --> 33:09.988
- Wife material?
- Definitely.

33:10.156 --> 33:11.448
Better than the last one.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.991
You should see some of the...

33:13.117 --> 33:14.785
Yeah, I could dock your wages
for insubordination.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.119
Get back to work.

33:16.162 --> 33:20.166
Clostridium acetobutylicum
doesn't acidogenically ferment itself.

33:24.004 --> 33:26.631
It looks like you've got
the Janet seal of approval.

33:26.674 --> 33:28.883
I'm not sure I'm the marrying type.

33:29.051 --> 33:32.345
You realise you'd be the heir
to a solvents fortune.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.138
And that's not to be sniffed at.

33:34.181 --> 33:36.349
Literally, it could result in convulsions,

33:36.392 --> 33:37.809
coma, severe brain damage,

33:37.851 --> 33:39.560
and in some cases, mental retardation.

33:41.397 --> 33:44.858
They do all seem remarkably happy here.
Is it the fumes?

33:45.902 --> 33:48.237
These people, they're like family to me.

33:48.363 --> 33:50.197
I've grown up on this factory floor.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.825
I spent every summer here since I was two.

33:53.410 --> 33:57.038
If you're good to people,
people will be good to you.

33:57.873 --> 34:01.376
It's what my dad taught me.
It's what I want to teach my kids.

34:03.170 --> 34:05.005
And I want to end all wars and cure cancer.

34:43.254 --> 34:45.589
- All right?
- Yeah. What?

34:46.090 --> 34:48.759
You really... You don't have to come
tonight if you don't want to.

34:48.885 --> 34:50.594
No, I want to be there.
Your husband should support you.

34:51.429 --> 34:52.429
You look incredible.

34:52.472 --> 34:53.972
I warn you, you'll be bored to tears

34:54.098 --> 34:56.099
'cause I'm gonna have to network all night.

34:56.141 --> 34:58.060
That's the cab. Seriously.

34:59.270 --> 35:01.646
- Last chance to bail.
- No, I want to go. I love a party.

35:01.773 --> 35:03.815
Uh, will I need a coat? Is it cold out?

35:03.941 --> 35:05.444
Why do you always ask me that?

35:05.779 --> 35:08.280
How should I know if you need a coat?

35:08.406 --> 35:10.991
I've been outside today,
you've been outside today.

35:11.117 --> 35:15.079
I have precisely the same amount
of meteorological information as you do.

35:20.752 --> 35:21.960
Josh!

35:30.261 --> 35:33.138
I wouldn't want to be stuck behind him
going through airport security.

35:42.024 --> 35:44.984
Because it's all metal.

35:45.486 --> 35:47.321
He's so funny, your husband.
You've got a good one there.

35:47.364 --> 35:48.656
Thanks, that's sweet.

35:50.867 --> 35:53.369
Why don't you, um, go and mingle?

35:53.495 --> 35:54.787
There's a band upstairs.

35:55.288 --> 35:57.832
No, I think I'm gonna stay here.
But you go, mingle, enjoy yourself.

35:59.668 --> 36:02.336
Are you staying here because you think
you have a good joke about that photo?

36:03.296 --> 36:04.338
What?

36:05.507 --> 36:06.507
You are!

36:07.008 --> 36:09.510
You're staying here so you can
say that joke about the photo.

36:09.553 --> 36:11.846
It's a good joke.
I actually have a couple.

36:11.972 --> 36:13.889
Wouldn't want to be behind him
going through airport security.

36:16.184 --> 36:17.894
At least, if you went out with him,

36:18.020 --> 36:19.563
you'd always have a little place
to hang your coat.

36:21.691 --> 36:23.066
I'm Josh Moss. Nice to meet you.

36:23.192 --> 36:24.818
- Hi.
- Ooh! She's gone.

36:26.572 --> 36:28.698
You could put your keys
on there, couldn't you?

36:30.868 --> 36:34.704
I think that's just what happens
when you sleep next to an open sewer.

36:35.038 --> 36:37.999
Had amoebic dysentery. Twice.

36:38.250 --> 36:39.375
In Rwanda at one point,

36:39.418 --> 36:42.378
I was actually defecating
pieces of my colon.

36:52.765 --> 36:53.891
Miss Redfearn.

36:55.518 --> 36:56.685
Guy!

36:58.354 --> 37:00.772
Lovely to see you. I er...
I didn't realise you were here.

37:00.899 --> 37:03.025
You know, it's actually
good that I ran into you

37:03.067 --> 37:05.068
because I was thinking about
some of those community outreach...

37:05.195 --> 37:07.071
Could we take one night
off from talking shop?

37:07.907 --> 37:10.950
Am I allowed to say you're
looking incredible?

37:11.076 --> 37:12.702
Technically, no.

37:12.745 --> 37:14.412
That would constitute sexual harassment.

37:14.538 --> 37:17.707
You're right. The rules and regulations
on that are very strict these days.

37:17.750 --> 37:22.462
I actually have a copy of the Sexual
Discrimination Act 2007 in my hotel room

37:22.588 --> 37:24.047
if you'd like to come back and peruse it.

37:25.549 --> 37:27.927
Although Christmas parties
don't really count.

37:29.763 --> 37:31.597
They're an opportunity to tell the person

37:31.640 --> 37:33.140
you've had a secret crush on all year

37:33.266 --> 37:36.101
how you really feel about them.

37:38.813 --> 37:40.773
Aren't they?

37:41.274 --> 37:42.775
Are they?

37:42.817 --> 37:44.485
Of course.

37:44.611 --> 37:47.822
I think protocol and decorum
go right out the window.

37:48.616 --> 37:49.824
I mean, look at that guy.

37:51.410 --> 37:52.452
That is embarrassing.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.287
Who is he?

37:54.413 --> 37:55.997
Leave him alone, he's just had a few.

37:56.123 --> 37:57.916
Hang on.
He's attempting the BeyoncÃ© booty shake.

37:57.959 --> 38:01.419
Either that or he's being
sodomised by the Invisible Man.

38:01.462 --> 38:03.839
Oh, he's just had a few too many cocktails.

38:03.966 --> 38:05.341
He's wasted.

38:06.093 --> 38:08.469
- Having a good time.
- Yeah, sure is.

38:11.682 --> 38:13.474
Oi, oi!

38:14.643 --> 38:17.603
Hold on.
Look out, here comes twinkle toes.

38:17.646 --> 38:19.188
He's making a beeline.

38:19.314 --> 38:21.107
I got your back,
I'll just say I'm your boyfriend.

38:21.149 --> 38:22.275
- No, you don't have to do that.
- It's fine.

38:24.528 --> 38:26.821
This party's amazing. So much fun.

38:27.489 --> 38:29.992
Guy Harrap. Pleased to meet you.

38:30.785 --> 38:34.663
Oh! The solvents guy!

38:35.164 --> 38:37.833
How are you? Nice to meet you.
He's so handsome, isn't he?

38:40.713 --> 38:42.380
Whoo!

38:42.506 --> 38:44.340
Bollocks.

38:46.385 --> 38:47.677
Sorry.

38:48.012 --> 38:49.178
Come on!

38:49.722 --> 38:50.722
Is that...

38:50.848 --> 38:52.724
Yeah, I suppose that's what
office parties are for, huh?

38:52.850 --> 38:54.058
That's hilarious!

38:54.184 --> 38:56.853
Free booze and a chance
to make out with the boss.

38:57.187 --> 38:58.521
Well, I'm technically self-employed,

38:58.647 --> 39:01.858
so I'll just have to settle for
a can of Budweiser and a wank.

39:02.359 --> 39:03.401
Charming.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.571
Can I ask the sexiest woman in the room
for a dance?

39:06.697 --> 39:07.739
Listen, I...

39:07.865 --> 39:10.492
We're actually talking business.
So, maybe later.

39:14.498 --> 39:16.708
Shouldn't you be busting a move?

39:30.848 --> 39:32.724
You almost have to admire him
for giving it a go.

39:32.767 --> 39:34.351
You owe me one.

39:35.603 --> 39:37.562
How about we make our excuses?

39:37.605 --> 39:39.272
I have a table on hold at Nobu.

39:39.398 --> 39:41.399
No, I can't, I've a...

39:42.068 --> 39:44.361
I should go.
I think I need some fresh air.

39:44.737 --> 39:46.071
Sure.

39:47.573 --> 39:49.617
Hang on, I'm swapping hands.

39:51.079 --> 39:55.957
So, you had an extra naan
and two glasses of wine,

39:56.084 --> 39:58.293
so you owe an extra four pounds.

39:58.419 --> 39:59.753
Drew...

39:59.879 --> 40:02.589
...you had the mango lassi,
so that's an extra three pounds.

40:03.257 --> 40:06.927
I swear, the mass graves in Mogadishu
weren't as awful as this.

40:07.095 --> 40:08.595
Do you want to bail?

40:08.971 --> 40:10.597
Did you have the chicken jalfrezi?

40:10.932 --> 40:12.432
I want to stay. It's fun.

40:12.558 --> 40:14.726
No, I've said hello to everybody I need to.

40:14.769 --> 40:16.728
It's just gonna get messy
and it's no fun being a spectator.

40:16.771 --> 40:19.648
I wouldn't like to be stood
behind him at airport security.

40:19.774 --> 40:22.442
That was my joke! He stole it!

40:22.568 --> 40:24.277
He's taking credit for my humour.
Should I say something?

40:24.404 --> 40:25.780
Jesus, Josh!

40:26.615 --> 40:28.408
When did you turn into such a prat?

40:29.076 --> 40:32.788
Stay. Dance like a fucking idiot,
tell your stupid jokes. I'm going home.

40:34.457 --> 40:36.959
That hoop in his ear,
he could hang his house keys on it.

40:47.470 --> 40:49.179
God, you are so sexy.

40:50.473 --> 40:51.974
You're so sexy.

40:52.100 --> 40:53.308
Thanks.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.985
Hey, that's it, honey, slide in,
room for one more. Huh?

41:02.153 --> 41:04.279
Hey, Alexandra.

41:07.324 --> 41:08.491
You look really nice.

41:09.994 --> 41:12.037
Different from work.

41:12.289 --> 41:15.374
Do you two want to have a little hello kiss?

41:15.500 --> 41:17.376
- Um, hello.
- That's it.

41:18.295 --> 41:19.378
Hi.

41:19.838 --> 41:20.880
Mmm, that's it.

41:21.173 --> 41:24.383
Did you guys like that dinner tonight?

41:25.552 --> 41:28.387
Did you go for the rice or the naan?

41:29.347 --> 41:30.514
I went for the naan.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.016
Yeah? Mmm!

41:32.142 --> 41:34.018
You are so naughty.

41:34.352 --> 41:36.312
Why are you so naughty?

41:36.354 --> 41:39.649
I don't know, Charlie, why is that?

41:39.692 --> 41:42.027
Did your mom smoke during her pregnancy?

41:43.696 --> 41:45.530
Oh, okay.

41:46.157 --> 41:47.407
All right.

41:47.533 --> 41:49.659
That's it. Yeah, I like that.

41:50.328 --> 41:51.662
Threesome.
We're going to have a threesome.

41:51.705 --> 41:52.914
We're having a threesome.

41:53.749 --> 41:55.041
Let's go.

41:55.667 --> 41:58.211
- Chloe's climbing aboard.
- That's it.

41:58.921 --> 42:01.714
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

42:01.882 --> 42:04.175
Oh! Oh, yeah.

42:04.218 --> 42:05.927
Chloe's on top now.

42:06.053 --> 42:07.428
The cherry on top.

42:07.554 --> 42:08.888
Oh, yeah.

42:09.014 --> 42:11.432
Oh, yeah. Now she's on the bottom.

42:11.892 --> 42:14.269
Chloe loves being on bottom.

42:14.395 --> 42:15.395
Oh, yes.

42:15.855 --> 42:19.066
Yes, squeeze my breast.
That feels amazing.

42:19.192 --> 42:20.567
Não para, Charlie.

42:21.069 --> 42:22.402
Yeah, Charlie,

42:22.529 --> 42:24.738
I can speak another language as well.

42:24.864 --> 42:26.532
Me Ilamo Chloe, Charlie.

42:27.784 --> 42:30.244
Yo tengo un hermano!

42:31.539 --> 42:32.914
- That's it.
- Okay.

42:32.957 --> 42:34.374
Okay. Yeah, that's it.

42:34.416 --> 42:35.959
Chloe's in the middle now.

42:36.961 --> 42:38.253
Okay.

42:38.379 --> 42:41.422
Oh, yes. It feels amazing, doesn't it?

42:41.465 --> 42:43.216
Feels so good.

42:46.971 --> 42:49.765
God, you're strong, Alexandra.

42:50.892 --> 42:51.892
Yes.

42:54.229 --> 42:55.229
Down here again.

42:56.273 --> 42:59.316
Oh, yeah, put your fingers in my mouth.
I love that.

43:00.610 --> 43:03.946
Especially after Indian. It's amazing.

43:04.406 --> 43:05.614
Excuse me.

43:05.949 --> 43:07.616
Excuse me. No!

43:08.326 --> 43:10.244
All right. Enough!

43:10.787 --> 43:12.497
I am leaving!

43:13.082 --> 43:15.083
You people, you're sick!

43:20.756 --> 43:22.132
I actually forgot my skirt.

43:22.258 --> 43:24.135
I'm sorry.

43:30.142 --> 43:32.643
Okay, thanks. Thanks, everybody.

43:33.979 --> 43:37.023
And FYI, you both still
have your underwear on.

44:16.523 --> 44:20.026
Hey, it's Chloe.
I really need to speak to you.

44:27.534 --> 44:29.369
- Hey.
- Hi, it's me.

44:30.037 --> 44:32.664
I demand you let me in. I've got coffee

44:32.707 --> 44:34.041
and a bag of those little sweets you like

44:34.167 --> 44:35.669
that look like mini fried eggs.

44:39.715 --> 44:43.093
It was humiliating, degrading.

44:45.012 --> 44:48.014
I don't even know how I got myself
into that position.

44:48.057 --> 44:50.433
I am not a threesome person.

44:51.352 --> 44:53.603
I don't know what bits to touch when.

44:53.729 --> 44:55.355
Listen, fuck him.

44:56.065 --> 44:57.565
If he doesn't realise how amazing you are,

44:57.692 --> 44:58.733
then he's an idiot.

45:00.027 --> 45:01.778
- He doesn't deserve you.
- Yeah, right.

45:01.904 --> 45:03.113
I mean, look at me.

45:03.239 --> 45:05.365
I'm in a rented flat

45:05.408 --> 45:09.577
wearing a SpongeBob
SquarePants dressing gown,

45:09.620 --> 45:11.872
eating a mixture of animal fat and sugar

45:11.915 --> 45:14.209
made to look like a fried egg.

45:15.253 --> 45:16.253
I'm 32 years old.

45:16.629 --> 45:20.090
Yeah, and you've spent
your whole life doing things

45:20.216 --> 45:23.802
which make everybody else
look shallow, trivial and pointless.

45:24.470 --> 45:26.763
I think it's slightly more important
to be able to limit

45:26.806 --> 45:28.640
the spread of an epidemic

45:29.434 --> 45:31.393
than know how to conduct yourself
in a threesome.

45:33.062 --> 45:34.104
You do?

45:34.272 --> 45:37.315
I mean, for the purposes
of this conversation, sure.

45:43.948 --> 45:47.660
Honestly, I just want someone
to look after me for a change.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.245
Well, I'll look after you.

45:51.081 --> 45:52.123
You can't.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.419
You've already got someone to look after.

46:07.599 --> 46:11.268
Listen, I'm completely all right.

46:12.479 --> 46:14.646
I promise not to end it all.

46:15.148 --> 46:17.941
I don't even own a razor. I wax.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.819
I think it's pretty hard
to wax yourself to death.

46:24.366 --> 46:26.534
You can leave. I'm okay.

46:26.660 --> 46:28.369
No, it's all right.

46:29.288 --> 46:31.956
I'm putting off my Christmas shopping.

46:33.375 --> 46:35.795
I'm trying to figure out what to buy Nat.

46:37.798 --> 46:39.173
What does she like?

46:39.966 --> 46:41.050
I've no idea.

46:42.677 --> 46:45.471
I was thinking casserole dishes, maybe.

46:46.723 --> 46:50.017
I simply cannot let you get your new wife

46:50.143 --> 46:51.811
- casserole dishes for Christmas.
- Why?

46:51.853 --> 46:53.020
I mean...

46:54.147 --> 46:55.856
- Let me help you out.
- A griddle pan.

46:55.982 --> 46:57.192
- No!
- A set of knives.

46:57.235 --> 46:59.820
Enough. I'm gonna go and get changed.

47:05.660 --> 47:06.910
Thanks, Josh.

47:07.537 --> 47:08.870
Ah, it's all right.

47:16.046 --> 47:17.880
Excuse me. Thank you.

47:21.635 --> 47:23.010
- Hey.
- Hello.

47:25.139 --> 47:27.014
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm. Can I ask...

47:27.516 --> 47:28.850
why we're meeting in your hotel?

47:28.892 --> 47:30.810
You do know I'm not going
up to your room, don't you?

47:31.353 --> 47:34.523
Oh! No, of course not. Purely business.

47:34.732 --> 47:36.567
No sexual tension whatsoever.

47:36.651 --> 47:40.195
No undercurrent of erotic electricity

47:40.238 --> 47:43.240
between two ludicrously attractive
single people.

47:43.575 --> 47:45.993
None. Absolutely not.

47:46.411 --> 47:47.744
Good.

47:47.871 --> 47:49.746
It's your time you're paying for.

47:49.831 --> 47:52.374
So, we need to lock down
a date for the website.

47:52.417 --> 47:55.252
It's just there are some tiny kittens
up in my room

47:55.379 --> 47:57.881
playing adorably with a ball of wool.

47:58.257 --> 48:00.925
- If you're interested.
- Cat faeces makes you go blind.

48:01.051 --> 48:04.095
- I'm not going to your room.
- Okay. You win.

48:04.221 --> 48:08.684
We'll work and completely ignore the
palpable sizzle of sensual possibility

48:08.768 --> 48:10.853
every time our bodies accidentally touch.

48:13.273 --> 48:15.608
I've booked a boardroom down the hall.

48:16.443 --> 48:17.568
Shall we?

48:18.028 --> 48:19.904
Yeah, basically, I'm looking
for something for my wife.

48:19.946 --> 48:23.282
You know, pair of pants
and a brassiere, perhaps.

48:23.366 --> 48:27.119
Something that's long-lasting
and practical.

48:27.787 --> 48:29.788
Goodness, is that man-made fibre?

48:29.915 --> 48:32.541
Or is it, um, natural?

48:32.626 --> 48:35.461
Or is it a mixture of the two?
Because that's often the way these days.

48:35.587 --> 48:37.797
Helps with, um, durability and so on.

48:37.924 --> 48:39.466
I mean, that's a lovely bit of kit.
Look at that.

48:39.592 --> 48:41.259
That's a formidable gusset.
You could not break that.

48:41.302 --> 48:44.138
- Were you looking for a panty?
- Christ. Am I...

48:45.807 --> 48:46.891
A panty.

48:46.975 --> 48:48.643
Uh...

48:48.894 --> 48:50.561
He has trouble with
the word "panty", I think.

48:50.646 --> 48:53.397
No, I don't. "Panty."
I'm looking for a panty, mon chéri.

48:53.482 --> 48:56.275
A portion of your finest panties, milord.

48:57.277 --> 49:00.321
Right.
Um, perhaps I should just ask you.

49:00.447 --> 49:01.656
After all, you are standing right here.

49:03.450 --> 49:05.826
Oh, God, no, no, no. I'm not his wife.

49:06.119 --> 49:08.329
- No way.
- I'm just helping out,

49:08.455 --> 49:10.998
making sure he doesn't buy
his actual wife vouchers.

49:11.124 --> 49:12.250
Well, you can't actually go wrong with vouchers.

49:12.334 --> 49:14.001
Christ, is that really the price?

49:16.506 --> 49:18.590
I could buy half an 18-litre
dehumidifier for that.

49:18.675 --> 49:20.260
- Sir.
- Yes.

49:20.344 --> 49:22.262
We like to celebrate the erotic here.

49:22.346 --> 49:24.806
Celebrate.
"One-nil. Oy-oy! I scored a goal."

49:24.848 --> 49:26.683
- You don't need to be ashamed.
- I'm not ashamed of anything.

49:26.767 --> 49:28.685
- Embrace it.
- I'll embrace you.

49:28.769 --> 49:29.852
I didn't mean that, I'm really sorry.

49:30.688 --> 49:33.356
It's all right. Why don't you tell me...

49:33.691 --> 49:35.984
- Yeah?
...what turns you on?

49:36.360 --> 49:40.697
Uh... What turns me on?

49:41.115 --> 49:42.699
I don't... What, really?

49:44.868 --> 49:47.120
I, uh, I like it...
I like it when she...

49:49.540 --> 49:53.626
dresses up like a policewoman, or estate agent.

49:55.130 --> 50:00.302
We haven't met,
and she forces me to do things to her

50:01.220 --> 50:03.722
that I would never normally do.

50:06.058 --> 50:07.976
- Right.
- Yeah.

50:09.061 --> 50:11.896
I was thinking more along the lines of lace.

50:11.981 --> 50:13.064
Were you?

50:13.190 --> 50:14.733
- Satin?
- Satin.

50:15.484 --> 50:16.484
Fishnets?

50:16.569 --> 50:20.238
Fishnets, the fish of the sea.
Fish of the sea. A trawlerman.

50:20.323 --> 50:23.908
I once saw a trawlerman.

50:24.744 --> 50:26.077
You must know the lucky lady.

50:26.746 --> 50:28.330
Any thoughts?

50:28.414 --> 50:30.415
You're as useless at all this sexy stuff
as I am, aren't you?

50:30.917 --> 50:34.086
You're happy with a thermal nightie,
a Stieg Larsson and a nice milky tea.

50:36.923 --> 50:40.927
I'm just gonna go have a browse.
Leave you to it.

50:42.764 --> 50:44.431
Oh, this is nice.

50:44.557 --> 50:46.767
They also have a wonderful restaurant.

50:46.851 --> 50:49.770
I wouldn't think of staying
anywhere else when I'm in London.

50:50.229 --> 50:56.443
So, what is our strategy
when it comes to online awareness?

50:56.861 --> 51:00.447
So, the idea is to drive the consumer
to the site through...

51:01.240 --> 51:05.118
Oysters?

51:06.205 --> 51:07.288
Seriously, Guy.

51:07.956 --> 51:10.583
They must have run out of Highland shortbread.

51:11.752 --> 51:14.962
To drive consumers to the site
through a unified multiplatform...

51:18.259 --> 51:21.136
A unified multiplatform approach,
accessible with...

51:25.100 --> 51:27.810
Yes, go on. Platforms, that was good.

51:28.311 --> 51:33.148
Well, traditional media
should not be ignored, either.

51:34.109 --> 51:36.235
Doves? Really?

51:36.986 --> 51:38.821
I think you're amazing, Nat.

51:38.947 --> 51:41.615
I know it's unprofessional and cliché, but...

51:41.659 --> 51:43.243
I'm married.

51:43.953 --> 51:45.495
What?

51:46.288 --> 51:48.331
I'm married. I have a husband.

51:51.252 --> 51:54.170
How can you?
Why didn't you say something?

51:54.296 --> 51:56.464
For all this time, you didn't think to tell me?

51:56.507 --> 52:00.261
I didn't say anything because
I thought we'd get the account if...

52:01.513 --> 52:03.305
if I flirted with you.

52:03.348 --> 52:06.851
And then I liked flirting with you
too much for any of this to stop.

52:06.977 --> 52:09.854
Well, this wouldn't be happening
if you were happy with your husband.

52:10.647 --> 52:12.022
What am I supposed to say?

52:12.649 --> 52:15.860
I can't leave him, he'd be destroyed.
Look, I'm really sorry,

52:15.986 --> 52:18.363
but that dove's getting
awfully close to the ceiling fan.

52:19.157 --> 52:20.866
Who is this guy? Do you have children?

52:21.451 --> 52:23.994
- How long have you been married?
- Look, that's irrelevant. He's...

52:24.036 --> 52:25.871
He's dependable and...

52:28.207 --> 52:29.541
...and he's kind and safe,

52:29.625 --> 52:32.127
and I can't throw that all away for you.

52:32.211 --> 52:34.671
I mean, you're charming and twinkly.

52:36.299 --> 52:39.135
Look, you're a Ferrari and he's a Volvo,
and right now...

52:41.805 --> 52:43.389
I just need to be behind the wheel of a Volvo.

52:43.849 --> 52:45.558
I need...

52:48.187 --> 52:49.395
I need reliability

52:49.813 --> 52:54.026
and to be able to get from A to B
safe and unhurt.

52:54.319 --> 52:55.402
Oh! God!

52:55.737 --> 52:57.237
Dove down, dove down!

52:57.363 --> 52:59.990
It's okay, I think it's just stunned.
Can you...

53:00.074 --> 53:02.034
- Do you want me to stop now?
- Yes.

53:02.076 --> 53:04.161
Listen, Nat. I'm not giving up.

53:04.412 --> 53:06.580
From the minute I met you
I've thought of nothing else.

53:06.664 --> 53:10.083
Do you think I care if our logo
has a drop shadow or is italicised? No.

53:10.418 --> 53:12.836
I'm looking for excuses to see you.

53:12.921 --> 53:14.087
Come on.

53:14.172 --> 53:16.089
And I'm not twinkly.

53:16.716 --> 53:18.342
I don't twinkle with anyone else.

53:19.595 --> 53:21.596
You make me twinkly.

53:24.099 --> 53:26.017
Ugh! God!

53:26.101 --> 53:28.437
That's supposed to be lucky.

53:29.105 --> 53:31.398
Look, as might be evident, I've never
done this kind of thing before,

53:31.441 --> 53:35.528
but I would regret it forever
if I didn't try everything I could.

53:36.029 --> 53:39.907
Married or not, I need to be with you, Nat.

53:42.744 --> 53:44.537
Mind... Mind, um... Sorry.

53:45.121 --> 53:48.082
I'm sorry. I can't do this. I'm sorry.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.377
Sorry.

53:58.260 --> 54:01.221
Perhaps in hindsight
you shouldn't have gone with the doves.

54:01.639 --> 54:02.806
Thanks.

54:05.602 --> 54:07.436
- You like those, sir?
- Uh, yeah.

54:07.646 --> 54:10.982
Crotchless. Interesting, lovely, yeah.
Do you get much of a call for those?

54:11.108 --> 54:12.984
- Shit.
- Everything all right in there?

54:13.110 --> 54:15.570
Yeah, I just...
I think this hook is caught.

54:15.654 --> 54:17.488
Yeah, I got it.
Uh, yeah, I have to admit

54:17.656 --> 54:20.575
I'm not very good with
buttons or zips or that sort of thing.

54:20.659 --> 54:22.910
Usually I... Holy fucking shit.

54:24.913 --> 54:26.163
I mean, who needs a dehumidifier, right?

54:26.832 --> 54:30.585
Sure, I get a bit of condensation on my
bedroom window sometimes, but it's fine.

54:31.003 --> 54:33.629
- Will you just close the...
- Oh, yeah, sorry. Sorry.

54:34.172 --> 54:36.340
- Um...
- Look, were they always like that?

54:36.466 --> 54:38.968
'Cause, I mean, they're unbelievable.

54:39.011 --> 54:43.683
I just thought that
I would try something unpractical.

54:45.352 --> 54:49.480
Do you think that Nat
would like something like this, or...

54:49.523 --> 54:51.107
Nat?

54:51.191 --> 54:54.694
Oh, of course.
Yeah, she'd look really nice.

54:56.363 --> 54:58.156
She'd look good.

54:58.198 --> 54:59.532
Um...

54:59.867 --> 55:01.451
Yeah, but I think maybe the...

55:01.535 --> 55:02.952
- I don't know if it's...
- What is it?

55:03.037 --> 55:05.204
I don't know if it's caught on the tag.

55:06.206 --> 55:07.373
I don't know what I did.

55:07.458 --> 55:09.500
Your hair's in the way, I'm just gonna...

55:18.053 --> 55:20.554
You know those, um,

55:21.057 --> 55:24.225
strips that they put in pants...

55:25.227 --> 55:27.228
if you want to try them on?

55:28.648 --> 55:32.233
Do you think that's to prevent
against gonorrhoea or chlamydia?

55:33.903 --> 55:36.696
That's the one these days, Chlamydia.
That's...

55:36.739 --> 55:39.240
Or so I've... so I've read.

55:55.926 --> 55:58.094
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I did that.

55:58.178 --> 56:01.515
No. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

56:01.599 --> 56:04.184
Excuse me, sir, will you be paying for that?

56:06.270 --> 56:07.938
Christ, I expect so.

56:08.356 --> 56:09.439
I'm sorry.

56:09.565 --> 56:11.942
I'm sorry, I just wanted you to know
how I feel about you

56:12.026 --> 56:15.320
- and I don't want to let you slip away.
- It's very complicated.

56:15.446 --> 56:17.614
- Chloe, that was really bad.
- I know.

56:17.699 --> 56:20.534
I mean, not the kiss or the visuals,
that was lovely,

56:20.785 --> 56:22.911
- but I'm married.
- I know.

56:23.121 --> 56:25.288
Oh, great, it's goddamn Beyoncé.

56:25.540 --> 56:28.042
What?! Fuck!

56:28.127 --> 56:30.461
- Beyoncé is my husband!
- What?

56:30.546 --> 56:32.213
Beyoncé is my husband!

56:32.798 --> 56:33.965
- Beyoncé is Josh.
- Him?

56:34.091 --> 56:35.466
Yes.

56:36.093 --> 56:37.385
Nat!

56:38.554 --> 56:40.304
- Hello, darling!
- How weird!

56:40.472 --> 56:42.474
- What a treat.
- How are you?

56:43.143 --> 56:44.893
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi.

56:45.145 --> 56:47.604
- Guy, right?
- Yeah. Josh?

56:47.647 --> 56:48.981
Yeah, that's right. Nice to see you.

56:49.107 --> 56:52.317
Guy, this is Chloe.
She's a wonderful, uh...

56:52.485 --> 56:53.652
charity worker.

56:53.737 --> 56:55.154
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:55.321 --> 56:57.114
Yeah, we were just doing
some Christmas shopping.

56:57.157 --> 56:58.490
We were just having a meeting around the corner.

56:58.616 --> 56:59.950
- Oh, were you?
- Yeah.

56:59.993 --> 57:02.328
- Nice.
- Yeah.

57:04.331 --> 57:06.750
- Did you have fun last night?
- Oh, it was awesome, awesome.

57:06.834 --> 57:10.003
Did you manage to get lucky with the ladies?

57:10.629 --> 57:14.007
No. Actually,
the girl I had my eye on blew me off.

57:14.175 --> 57:16.426
I ended up alone in the hotel
with a mini sleeve of Pringles

57:16.510 --> 57:18.470
watching Malaysian golf on Eurosport.

57:18.512 --> 57:20.930
That's hilarious.

57:25.937 --> 57:28.022
I find that incredibly difficult to believe.

57:28.190 --> 57:29.315
Well, it's true, it's true.

57:29.441 --> 57:30.941
What, a man as good-looking as you?

57:31.026 --> 57:35.821
Fabulous face, amazing hair, wonderful teeth.

57:35.864 --> 57:37.866
- A real hunk of spunk.
- Thank you.

57:37.950 --> 57:41.328
Amazing skin, that's what...
Hasn't he got incredible skin?

57:42.205 --> 57:44.164
- You do.
- Thank you.

57:44.207 --> 57:45.874
It's inspirational.

57:47.168 --> 57:49.002
Chloe's single. Aren't you?

57:50.046 --> 57:51.630
And she's American.

57:51.714 --> 57:53.882
- And you're... you could...
- ... ride the subway

57:54.008 --> 57:56.551
and have a malt at the Five and Dime.

57:56.677 --> 57:57.803
If that takes your fancy.

57:59.013 --> 58:00.722
If you want to.

58:00.848 --> 58:02.891
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

58:03.017 --> 58:04.727
Poor Chloe could probably think
of nothing worse,

58:05.062 --> 58:07.063
but maybe if we all went out together sometime,

58:07.189 --> 58:09.732
- that could be cool.
- Ooh!

58:10.067 --> 58:12.568
You could set that up,
couldn't you, Nat? Is that all right?

58:12.653 --> 58:16.907
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I will organise it. I'll organise it.

58:16.991 --> 58:18.075
Awesome.

58:18.159 --> 58:19.326
- Great.
- Okay.

58:19.410 --> 58:21.078
- Dinner after Christmas.
- Dinner.

58:21.204 --> 58:23.247
Yeah, sarsaparilla and hot dogs all round.

58:23.581 --> 58:25.749
- Very nice to meet you.
- You, too. You, too.

58:28.670 --> 58:33.257
Things really hit a low point around Christmas.

58:33.842 --> 58:36.426
His family's so weird.

58:37.762 --> 58:39.930
- That's not nice.
- They are. Come on.

58:40.348 --> 58:44.269
I caught your mother googling,
"Can cat urine be used as fertiliser?"

58:44.353 --> 58:46.938
She's got lots of cat urine.
She might as well use it.

58:47.690 --> 58:49.733
Why the fuck has she got lots of cat urine?

58:49.860 --> 58:52.695
Hey! Merry Christmas!

58:53.530 --> 58:55.030
At least my family are friendly.

58:55.115 --> 58:57.616
- Nat!
- Hi, Mum. You all right?

58:58.201 --> 59:00.870
You didn't exactly endear yourself
with the charades debacle.

59:02.372 --> 59:03.455
Here we go.

59:06.042 --> 59:07.751
- Play.
- Television.

59:09.462 --> 59:11.714
Four words. First word.

59:12.424 --> 59:14.466
- Unconscious.
- Dead.

59:14.551 --> 59:17.636
- Tapping. Computer.
- Hanging. Vera Duck.

59:17.762 --> 59:19.138
- Letters.
- Braille.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.098
- Red.
- Impotent! Thick!

59:21.141 --> 59:22.433
- Stupid.
- Man.

59:22.475 --> 59:23.559
- Effeminate.
- Husband?

59:23.643 --> 59:25.146
- Annoying idiot.
- Father?

59:25.272 --> 59:27.481
Disappointment. Shame. Regret.

59:27.566 --> 59:28.649
- Profession.
- Lazy.

59:28.775 --> 59:30.776
Doctor. "Doctor," thank you.

59:30.819 --> 59:33.487
"Doctor" is not the first thing
you think of when you look at him.

59:33.614 --> 59:35.573
- Four words. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde!
- Doctor Zhivago.

59:35.657 --> 59:37.783
Quick, quick, quick, you've got a minute!

59:37.826 --> 59:39.118
Go, go, go!

59:39.161 --> 59:41.913
- Second word.
- Sounds like... sister.

59:42.497 --> 59:44.165
- Nat.
- Fit. Sexy.

59:44.249 --> 59:46.459
- Young girl?
- Wife. Uh, woman.

59:46.793 --> 59:49.337
Nat, bat, sat, rat, cat, hat.

59:49.421 --> 59:51.339
Wife. Beautiful. Uh... The splits!

59:51.465 --> 59:53.132
- Cellist!
- Cello!

59:53.175 --> 59:55.843
- Hilary and Jackie.
- Family. Family.

59:56.511 --> 59:57.845
- What are you...
- Barren.

59:57.971 --> 01:00:00.974
Baron Münchhausen! Sorry, no. Um...

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:04.603
Um...

01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:07.273
Vagina.

01:00:08.108 --> 01:00:11.527
Pussy. Minge. Twat. Foo-foo.

01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:14.322
Clunge. Uh, growler.

01:00:14.365 --> 01:00:15.448
Quim.

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:17.700
Quim! Quim! Quim! Quim! Quim!

01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:19.369
Dr Quim and his Casebooks!

01:00:19.787 --> 01:00:21.871
- Dr Quinn Medicine Woman.
- That's it.

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:24.958
- Get away from me.
- What?

01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:27.710
You all right, Mother?

01:00:27.836 --> 01:00:29.128
What else rhymes with "Quinn"?

01:00:29.797 --> 01:00:31.005
Sounds like "chin"?

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:33.466
Sounds like "bin".

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:35.134
Yeah, all right, bloody Lionel Blair.

01:00:35.386 --> 01:00:37.054
Look, I was tired.

01:00:37.681 --> 01:00:39.515
I'd hardly slept, I wasn't thinking straight

01:00:39.557 --> 01:00:42.226
because your evil stepdad
had put me in that bedroom.

01:00:42.352 --> 01:00:44.561
Just to punish me.

01:00:44.729 --> 01:00:47.399
I would argue that you got
a better night's sleep

01:00:47.525 --> 01:00:49.859
than I did at your parents' house.

01:00:49.902 --> 01:00:50.902
- Oh, Brian!
- Elaine!

01:00:51.028 --> 01:00:53.029
Oh, Brian, you know just what I like!

01:00:53.072 --> 01:00:55.240
- Tits or face? Tits or face?
- Tits.

01:00:56.867 --> 01:00:57.909
Wrong answer!

01:00:57.994 --> 01:01:00.996
- Oh, Brian! Oh, my God.
- Sorry, darling.

01:01:01.414 --> 01:01:02.747
Yeah, well, your parents made it perfectly clear

01:01:02.873 --> 01:01:03.873
what they thought of me.

01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:06.876
- What have you got?
- Fantastic!

01:01:06.919 --> 01:01:09.587
- Digital photo frame.
- Wonderful!

01:01:09.714 --> 01:01:11.757
You just put a memory stick in
and it makes a slide show.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.759
We've got our camera on us,
we'll have to try it out later.

01:01:13.802 --> 01:01:15.803
That is fabulous. "ReKapture."

01:01:15.929 --> 01:01:17.722
My go? Thank you. Who's this from?

01:01:17.764 --> 01:01:19.056
Mum and Dad!

01:01:19.599 --> 01:01:21.100
Cracking.

01:01:24.438 --> 01:01:26.231
How to be a Successful Writer.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.151
And, um, Stop Wasting Your Life.

01:01:31.112 --> 01:01:32.779
- Good idea.
- Unbelievable.

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.906
- My family hate him...
- They hate me.

01:01:35.116 --> 01:01:36.783
...his family get under my skin,

01:01:36.909 --> 01:01:39.619
and, at a time when we should have
felt happy and close,

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:41.496
I couldn't have felt more distant.

01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:46.501
Explain again what your book's about.

01:01:46.587 --> 01:01:50.631
Well, my hero is a young
history professor called Ezra

01:01:50.758 --> 01:01:53.718
who, with the help of
a young American aid worker,

01:01:53.802 --> 01:01:57.805
discovers this man in Borneo
who claims to be Muhammad.

01:01:59.058 --> 01:02:02.977
So it's a meditation, really,
on the veracity and origins of faith.

01:02:03.062 --> 01:02:05.271
If he ever gets round to finishing it.

01:02:05.397 --> 01:02:07.107
Oi!

01:02:07.984 --> 01:02:09.485
Another drink, Josh?

01:02:09.611 --> 01:02:10.903
Oh, that'd be lovely, thank you.

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:24.959
Oh, that's gorgeous.

01:02:26.003 --> 01:02:28.338
- Ice?
- Uh, yes, please.

01:02:29.006 --> 01:02:30.256
Mmm.

01:02:30.341 --> 01:02:32.342
That's sweet.

01:02:34.637 --> 01:02:36.304
Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help?

01:02:36.347 --> 01:02:37.931
- No, thank you, I'm fine.
- I have to help!

01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:39.349
Oh!

01:02:40.142 --> 01:02:41.267
Mince pie, Alec?

01:02:42.478 --> 01:02:44.020
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?

01:02:44.146 --> 01:02:45.438
Why are you standing like that?

01:02:45.523 --> 01:02:46.816
Just offering Alec a mince pie.

01:02:46.858 --> 01:02:48.109
He doesn't want a mince pie.

01:02:48.193 --> 01:02:49.819
- You don't... You don't?
- No.

01:02:51.363 --> 01:02:52.780
Just stand up.

01:02:54.491 --> 01:02:57.034
That's that market we went to in Taroudant.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.954
- Let me see, darling.
- Yes.

01:02:59.038 --> 01:03:01.331
Um, it was gorgeous,
they had the most incredible figs.

01:03:01.374 --> 01:03:03.375
I'm sure nobody wants to hear about the figs.

01:03:03.459 --> 01:03:05.168
Because it wasn't very...
Look at the cat!

01:03:05.211 --> 01:03:06.628
Fucking little cocksucker.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.547
Give this back to me.

01:03:09.382 --> 01:03:10.674
Give it!

01:03:11.968 --> 01:03:13.385
Just sit down.

01:03:15.179 --> 01:03:16.388
Goodness me.

01:03:16.514 --> 01:03:18.682
- Is it still working?
- Yes.

01:03:18.724 --> 01:03:23.353
This is the town square. They had
snake charmers and performing monkeys.

01:03:23.479 --> 01:03:25.188
Oh! That looks so magical.

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.692
Me with a monkey.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.569
Darling, you look so sweet.

01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:33.239
Oh! Me trying on those slippers.
They were very pretty.

01:03:33.323 --> 01:03:34.741
They look it.

01:03:35.577 --> 01:03:36.660
Us having cocktails.

01:03:36.744 --> 01:03:38.829
There was a beautiful bar
at the top of the hotel.

01:03:38.913 --> 01:03:40.414
We'd go there every evening.

01:03:40.832 --> 01:03:42.875
Us having more cocktails.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:09.778
It was a junior suite.

01:04:09.905 --> 01:04:12.281
Uh... Not terribly expensive.

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:16.577
Lovely view of the orchards.
In fact, you can... If you just...

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:19.747
You can just see in the
background there, the... Phwoar.

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:23.584
That's doggy style.

01:04:24.669 --> 01:04:26.587
Nat's favourite. Isn't it, Nat?

01:04:36.014 --> 01:04:37.806
Why don't I drive?

01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:39.683
You drive like you've got a vagina.

01:04:39.768 --> 01:04:42.645
You could do.
Or I could glue myself to a deckchair

01:04:42.729 --> 01:04:44.188
and you could kick me down a stairwell.

01:04:44.272 --> 01:04:47.025
Both about as enjoyable.
Both about as likely to happen.

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:49.820
Why do you do it?

01:04:49.905 --> 01:04:52.365
Why are you still together?
You hate each other.

01:04:52.449 --> 01:04:55.201
Of course we do, but that's marriage.

01:04:56.203 --> 01:04:58.204
I mean, you embrace the hatred.

01:04:59.289 --> 01:05:01.165
And I married a man who wears driving gloves.

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:02.541
Actually helps you get purchase.

01:05:02.626 --> 01:05:04.710
Don't say "purchase".

01:05:04.962 --> 01:05:08.589
But how do you know that the hate
won't outweigh the love?

01:05:08.674 --> 01:05:11.175
How do you know there's not
someone better out there for you?

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:13.761
Well, Christ, there is.
Of course there is.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.639
But marriage is about living
with the imperfections, isn't it?

01:05:16.723 --> 01:05:18.766
I mean, look at that stupid ginger face.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.728
It's true. I'd miss her.

01:05:21.813 --> 01:05:23.605
Look at those beautiful eyes, big warm heart.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.732
You know, she hasn't aged a day since I met her.

01:05:25.817 --> 01:05:29.779
And as you get to know each other more,
well, you love each other more.

01:05:30.114 --> 01:05:31.823
No, don't you try and kiss me.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.371
- Did you forget something?
- Yeah.

01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:41.916
- We're gonna hit traffic, you know.
- Yeah, you will.

01:05:45.629 --> 01:05:46.713
Tonight should be interesting.

01:05:46.797 --> 01:05:48.965
They could be really right for each other.

01:05:49.049 --> 01:05:51.926
Because Chloe's so sweet,
and Guy seems all right.

01:05:52.011 --> 01:05:54.387
What do you think? What about that?

01:05:54.513 --> 01:05:55.848
No?

01:05:56.224 --> 01:05:57.474
Yeah.

01:05:57.559 --> 01:06:01.270
Chloe's lovely.
I don't know how you let her slip away.

01:06:01.604 --> 01:06:03.355
What, Chloe? No!

01:06:04.357 --> 01:06:06.775
She's too nice. She's too perfect.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.986
A little of Chloe goes a long way.

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.780
Yeah, I mean, she can be kind of grating.

01:06:10.865 --> 01:06:13.742
Totally. This one? Rugby?

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:15.994
No?

01:06:16.579 --> 01:06:19.831
But Guy, I mean, he's quite a catch.
He's just your type, really.

01:06:19.915 --> 01:06:23.418
No, he's too slick for his own good.

01:06:23.961 --> 01:06:25.337
Bit too American.

01:06:26.088 --> 01:06:28.048
You're my type.
I don't really go for good-looking.

01:06:28.674 --> 01:06:30.008
Oh.

01:06:34.556 --> 01:06:38.017
Hi. Great to see you.
You're looking very sexy.

01:06:38.101 --> 01:06:39.352
And, Nat, you look good, too.

01:06:43.982 --> 01:06:45.191
Uh, you two pop yourselves down.

01:06:45.275 --> 01:06:46.567
I'm gonna nip off to the little boys' room.

01:06:46.651 --> 01:06:49.153
See if I can find myself some little boys.

01:06:49.237 --> 01:06:51.490
Obviously not.
Just gonna go for a quick wee.

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:52.616
Not the other.

01:06:54.952 --> 01:06:56.745
Sorry about that.

01:07:03.628 --> 01:07:05.712
So, is tonight not a bit weird?

01:07:05.797 --> 01:07:08.049
Do you promise not to get insanely jealous?

01:07:09.802 --> 01:07:11.135
Honestly.

01:07:12.096 --> 01:07:15.348
Chloe is fantastic. You'll love her.

01:07:16.016 --> 01:07:20.520
She's the best. The best!
She's so kind. Wonderfully kind.

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:22.939
- Mmm. Mmm.
- And pretty. She's very pretty.

01:07:23.023 --> 01:07:25.983
Definitely, she's so pretty.
Hundred percent.

01:07:31.282 --> 01:07:32.783
Hey, Chloe, you're here.

01:07:32.867 --> 01:07:35.869
Yeah. Look, if this is weird, I can go.

01:07:35.995 --> 01:07:39.206
It's just that, you know, you set it up
and you didn't seem to mind.

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:40.999
No, I don't mind, it's not weird.
Why would I find it weird?

01:07:41.084 --> 01:07:44.129
Listen, the bloke's a bit of a twat,
but you might like him.

01:07:44.672 --> 01:07:46.798
Oh, yeah! I love a twat.

01:07:46.882 --> 01:07:48.925
Single girl, looking for a guy.

01:07:49.009 --> 01:07:51.302
No non-twats considered.

01:07:51.387 --> 01:07:52.637
Oh, shit. Okay, they've seen us.

01:07:53.973 --> 01:07:55.807
Let's go do this.

01:07:55.891 --> 01:08:00.061
Okay, final game.
It's Brits one, Yanks one.

01:08:00.146 --> 01:08:02.981
We owe this to our great nation
to win this, Chloe.

01:08:03.065 --> 01:08:04.315
- Let's do it.
- Yes, sir!

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.818
Just look at us. We're all getting on
like a house on fire.

01:08:06.902 --> 01:08:08.653
I've never really understood that phrase.

01:08:08.737 --> 01:08:09.779
Exactly why is it good

01:08:09.864 --> 01:08:12.741
to get on like a house on fire? I mean,
there might be small kids left inside.

01:08:12.826 --> 01:08:13.909
- Think of them.
- I know!

01:08:13.994 --> 01:08:16.495
And the possibility of asphyxiation...

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.622
Or at the very least,
the loss of any no-claims bonus.

01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:21.334
It's just a metaphor.

01:08:21.419 --> 01:08:23.879
It means something that's
uncontrollable, has momentum.

01:08:24.005 --> 01:08:25.964
Exactly. So, tell me this.

01:08:26.048 --> 01:08:28.383
What would be the first thing
you'd save in a fire? Let me guess.

01:08:28.885 --> 01:08:30.635
- Jimmy Choos.
- Your wedding ring.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:34.305
Well, obviously my wedding ring.

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:36.808
But I've got two hands, haven't I?

01:08:36.893 --> 01:08:38.393
She does love that ring.

01:08:38.978 --> 01:08:41.563
The first thing I noticed about you.
Wasn't it?

01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:00.417
Sorry, Nat. Excuse me.

01:09:07.008 --> 01:09:08.050
Fuck off.

01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:10.636
Yeah, that's too bad.

01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:13.221
I'd probably rescue that necklace that I got you

01:09:13.305 --> 01:09:15.098
when we got engaged in Venice.

01:09:15.183 --> 01:09:17.309
That's sweet. It's beautiful.

01:09:19.312 --> 01:09:20.854
How about you, Chloe?

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:23.649
I'm guessing something sentimental, emotional?

01:09:24.484 --> 01:09:25.526
Um...

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:27.402
- It's your shot, Guy.
- Sorry?

01:09:27.487 --> 01:09:30.240
- It's your shot, mate.
- Sorry.

01:09:30.323 --> 01:09:32.576
You wouldn't really head for the shoes,
though, would you, Chloe?

01:09:32.661 --> 01:09:34.328
Fashion's not really your thing.

01:09:34.621 --> 01:09:36.663
Why would it be?
I mean, look at her.

01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:37.997
She'd make anything look fantastic.

01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:42.169
- She'd make a sack look incredible.
- Thanks.

01:09:42.254 --> 01:09:43.379
Good shot.

01:09:43.462 --> 01:09:46.631
Yeah, it's like, what's the opposite of,
"You cannot polish a turd"?

01:09:46.925 --> 01:09:48.634
She's an already polished turd.

01:09:48.926 --> 01:09:51.511
She's a turd buffed to a high sheen.

01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:53.680
Thanks.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.266
Unlucky, pal.

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:56.767
Yeah, honestly, if the stuff burnt up,

01:09:56.851 --> 01:09:59.687
I think I'd just view it
as a chance to start over,

01:09:59.771 --> 01:10:04.149
you know, have a new adventure. I'm not
too bothered by material possessions.

01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:06.695
All right, come down on it a bit.

01:10:07.113 --> 01:10:08.530
Come on.

01:10:08.614 --> 01:10:10.323
And use your arm to go back and forth with it

01:10:10.408 --> 01:10:11.658
so you really get a nice pumping action.

01:10:12.285 --> 01:10:13.411
Then go through the ball,

01:10:13.495 --> 01:10:15.454
and you want to hit it on the edge there.

01:10:15.539 --> 01:10:17.290
Ah, ah, ah! If you put the cue

01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:19.083
between your thumb and your first finger,

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:21.294
you'll find it easier to get...
That's it.

01:10:21.336 --> 01:10:24.297
Now get this moving before you take the shot.

01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:25.381
Come down a bit lower on it.

01:10:26.133 --> 01:10:28.175
Don't take the...
Come on, not that low.

01:10:29.011 --> 01:10:32.305
That's it.
Now play through the ball, and breathe.

01:10:34.391 --> 01:10:35.683
There's no point, is there?

01:10:35.767 --> 01:10:38.352
If we're not gonna do it properly,
it's like, what's the point?

01:10:38.437 --> 01:10:39.812
- There's no point in playing, is there?
- Nice try.

01:10:39.896 --> 01:10:41.690
Oh, I think it's my shot.

01:10:41.774 --> 01:10:43.150
I think Chloe's right.

01:10:43.234 --> 01:10:47.487
I mean, nice things is great,
but ultimately, so what?

01:10:47.572 --> 01:10:49.573
As long as the people you love are safe.

01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:51.742
That's it. You got that?

01:10:52.869 --> 01:10:54.078
Good shot, Chloe.

01:10:54.163 --> 01:10:55.580
Did you see that?

01:10:55.664 --> 01:10:57.457
That was... Wow!

01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:59.792
I can't believe it. Oh!

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.004
- It'll never happen again.
- Oh, it will. Be positive.

01:11:03.088 --> 01:11:05.673
No. Once in a lifetime.

01:11:06.508 --> 01:11:09.010
It's so sweet,
what you said about that necklace.

01:11:09.094 --> 01:11:10.094
Yeah.

01:11:10.179 --> 01:11:13.014
- I should wear it more often.
- Okay. What do you think?

01:11:13.098 --> 01:11:16.268
- I think you're good on your own.
- Oh, you touched the cue ball.

01:11:16.353 --> 01:11:17.728
- Oh.
- So...

01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.396
- Really?
- I mean, if you want to play proper...

01:11:19.481 --> 01:11:21.357
No, it's fine if you want to...

01:11:21.441 --> 01:11:22.900
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:11:22.984 --> 01:11:24.401
- Happens all the time, don't worry.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:24.486 --> 01:11:25.653
It's two shots if...

01:11:25.737 --> 01:11:28.238
- No, no, it's cool. You...
- All right. No, no. No, go ahead.

01:11:28.323 --> 01:11:29.698
- I don't want to be a dick about it...
- No!

01:11:29.783 --> 01:11:30.783
- Too late.
- Are you sure?

01:11:30.867 --> 01:11:31.950
- Take your two shots.
- Fine.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.162
- Well, that was fun.
- Yeah.

01:11:34.246 --> 01:11:35.872
We should do it again.
What do you say, Josh?

01:11:35.956 --> 01:11:37.499
Give you Brits a chance for revenge?

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:40.251
Oh, yeah, 'cause...
When my elbow's a bit better,

01:11:40.336 --> 01:11:41.961
I'll be able to give you
a much better game. Probably win.

01:11:42.046 --> 01:11:43.713
Yeah, that sounds fun.

01:11:43.798 --> 01:11:44.881
Can I walk you to your car?

01:11:45.007 --> 01:11:47.592
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna catch a cab,

01:11:47.677 --> 01:11:49.511
but you can wait with me if you like.

01:11:49.595 --> 01:11:51.304
- Be my pleasure.
- Okay.

01:11:51.389 --> 01:11:54.350
Actually, Guy, do you mind
if I quickly grab you for two minutes?

01:11:54.434 --> 01:11:56.560
Just to talk packaging before the meeting.

01:11:56.895 --> 01:11:58.020
Is that okay?

01:11:58.855 --> 01:12:00.856
- Sure.
- Thanks. Sorry.

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:03.693
Well, I could help you get a cab, if you want.

01:12:04.027 --> 01:12:05.152
And I'll wait with you.

01:12:06.988 --> 01:12:08.698
Okay, yeah.

01:12:10.242 --> 01:12:12.118
- I had a blast, partner.
- Oh!

01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:14.371
We are what make our nation great.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:17.457
I'd like to check out that Kandinsky
thing you were talking about.

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.459
That sounds very interesting.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.545
Thank you.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:26.049
Aw, that's nice. All right?

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:27.760
Okay, I'll see you back at the flat.

01:12:27.845 --> 01:12:29.971
All right. All the best.

01:12:32.433 --> 01:12:33.850
I presume we need to make a decision

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:37.019
on the LinkWorth tender for the branding.

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:38.813
What are your thoughts?

01:12:44.653 --> 01:12:47.196
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I thought you said that this...

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:02.714
Oh, Christ, even your underwear's amazing.

01:13:07.595 --> 01:13:09.763
It's a little fiddly.

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:12.515
Just rip it off. Just rip it!

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.267
There it is!

01:13:15.728 --> 01:13:19.773
That Guy's so dull. He's so bland.

01:13:20.357 --> 01:13:21.858
You don't like him, do you?

01:13:22.193 --> 01:13:23.485
Taxi!

01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:25.945
No?

01:13:28.032 --> 01:13:31.534
What's going on, Josh?
What are we even doing?

01:13:32.953 --> 01:13:35.039
What do you mean? Taxi!

01:13:36.082 --> 01:13:38.000
Your light's on! Put your light...

01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:39.669
His light was on. Why would...

01:13:41.422 --> 01:13:43.757
You realise I love you, don't you?

01:13:44.467 --> 01:13:46.718
I'm in love with a man who just got married

01:13:46.803 --> 01:13:49.095
and we're both pretending that it's fine.

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:50.847
Tonight was so fucked-up!

01:13:50.932 --> 01:13:52.307
Taxi!

01:13:55.728 --> 01:13:58.271
No, no.
Uh, excuse me, excuse me. No.

01:13:58.356 --> 01:14:00.148
No, no, no, you don't do that.

01:14:00.233 --> 01:14:02.234
That's not how decent people behave, is it?

01:14:02.318 --> 01:14:04.611
How is society supposed to function

01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:07.989
with people like you dragging us into a cesspit?

01:14:08.366 --> 01:14:09.741
Mmm? We're not animals!

01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:13.328
- Sorry, we just didn't see you.
- Didn't realise it was your taxi.

01:14:13.412 --> 01:14:15.582
- Please, take it.
- Take it, you can have it.

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:17.668
So sorry. I'm sorry.

01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:19.753
What am I supposed to do?

01:14:19.838 --> 01:14:22.422
I can't just walk out of a marriage
after nine months.

01:14:22.507 --> 01:14:23.715
Why not?

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.718
Pride? Afraid of what people will say?

01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:31.181
Figure out what you actually
want to fight for, Josh.

01:14:31.599 --> 01:14:32.850
When I went to Africa,

01:14:32.934 --> 01:14:35.394
I convinced myself that we were too young

01:14:35.478 --> 01:14:37.062
and somebody better would come along,

01:14:37.146 --> 01:14:39.147
but they never did and they still haven't.

01:14:39.858 --> 01:14:43.277
And now, every time I see you, I think,

01:14:43.361 --> 01:14:44.903
why didn't you stop me?

01:14:45.989 --> 01:14:48.156
Why didn't you fight?

01:14:51.829 --> 01:14:53.663
This has to stop.

01:14:54.498 --> 01:14:56.584
I can't see you any more.

01:14:57.627 --> 01:14:59.378
You're married.

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:03.507
I can't see you any more.

01:15:17.272 --> 01:15:19.356
- Dinner and a show, was it?
- As it happens.

01:15:19.441 --> 01:15:21.317
Yeah? Nice.

01:15:21.401 --> 01:15:22.860
Sorry.

01:15:40.797 --> 01:15:42.214
We need to talk.

01:15:42.716 --> 01:15:44.759
We do, yeah.

01:15:46.011 --> 01:15:48.012
I don't know what's happening here,

01:15:48.764 --> 01:15:50.389
but it's been nine months

01:15:51.558 --> 01:15:52.767
and neither of us is happy

01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:55.895
and I don't know how to change things.

01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:59.190
I just never imagined that marriage
would be this difficult, you know?

01:16:01.152 --> 01:16:03.403
I don't want to be Hugh and Naomi.

01:16:03.488 --> 01:16:05.989
I don't want to constantly row
over whether the bin's full or not.

01:16:06.074 --> 01:16:08.492
I don't see what's wrong with compacting
the rubbish to make more space...

01:16:08.576 --> 01:16:11.328
- I'm not rowing about the bin again.
- Neither am I.

01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:19.337
Look, if you want to walk away, I understand.

01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:21.631
Well, is that what you want?

01:16:22.091 --> 01:16:23.508
That's not what I'm saying.

01:16:23.592 --> 01:16:25.259
Because it sounds like
you don't want to make it work.

01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:28.471
Stop putting words into my mouth.

01:16:28.555 --> 01:16:30.223
You're the one who said marriage was difficult.

01:16:30.432 --> 01:16:32.934
Yeah, but I didn't say anything
about walking away.

01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:36.939
So, if you want to give up...

01:16:38.108 --> 01:16:39.400
I'm not the one giving up.

01:16:39.693 --> 01:16:41.026
Well, nor am I.

01:16:41.611 --> 01:16:42.736
Well,

01:16:42.862 --> 01:16:43.946
good.

01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:46.073
That's good.

01:16:50.161 --> 01:16:52.287
So what do we do?

01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:55.124
So, that's why we've come here today.

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:57.042
We've hit our low point,

01:16:57.127 --> 01:17:00.672
but we're committed
to making our marriage succeed.

01:17:02.758 --> 01:17:04.718
You should just cut your losses now

01:17:04.802 --> 01:17:07.303
before your life becomes a series of squabbles

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:09.472
about who's meant to pick the kids up,

01:17:09.557 --> 01:17:14.603
who put the King's Speech DVD
back in the Sound of Music DVD case.

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.981
I suppose, if you really want to make it work,

01:17:17.107 --> 01:17:20.985
you could try focusing on making it to a year.

01:17:22.362 --> 01:17:25.573
Commit to a life with each other
for the next three months.

01:17:49.391 --> 01:17:50.516
What is it?

01:17:51.018 --> 01:17:52.935
Is it a film?

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.395
- How many words?
- Novel?

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.481
Well, you must know how many words there are.

01:17:56.565 --> 01:17:58.357
Sounds like?

01:18:21.758 --> 01:18:24.260
I understand you're looking to sell.

01:18:27.223 --> 01:18:28.890
I'm from Foxtons.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:43.988
Boom, boom.

01:19:15.481 --> 01:19:19.526
So, this time last year,
you'd been Mrs Moss for...

01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:22.028
Sixty-seven, sixty-eight, sixty...

01:19:22.113 --> 01:19:24.072
...an hour and eight minutes.

01:19:24.907 --> 01:19:27.033
We made it.

01:19:27.577 --> 01:19:29.411
One year.

01:19:30.538 --> 01:19:32.914
We should be proud of ourselves.

01:19:37.921 --> 01:19:39.589
Ta-da.

01:19:40.592 --> 01:19:44.761
I thought I'd bring out the big guns
for a special occasion.

01:19:45.597 --> 01:19:47.931
- Could you help do me up?
- Yeah.

01:19:58.818 --> 01:20:00.360
I think two of these hooks are broken.

01:20:01.988 --> 01:20:03.906
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:08.493
- God. Um, let me fix it.
- All right.

01:20:22.761 --> 01:20:25.638
Hon, I've just remembered
I've got to do something. Um...

01:20:26.223 --> 01:20:29.308
I'll see you at the restaurant.
Tell Hugh and Naomi, okay?

01:20:29.559 --> 01:20:33.020
Sure. I'll see you there.

01:21:04.012 --> 01:21:06.639
You know, you haven't even
told me where we're going yet.

01:21:07.516 --> 01:21:09.809
I wanted to surprise you.

01:21:18.318 --> 01:21:21.196
Surprise!

01:21:22.115 --> 01:21:23.198
What's going on?

01:21:23.283 --> 01:21:25.033
I wanted to organise a little party for you.

01:21:25.326 --> 01:21:27.411
A year is a big achievement.

01:21:27.495 --> 01:21:28.912
Where is your stupid husband?

01:21:35.878 --> 01:21:37.921
Did you remember your passport?

01:21:39.299 --> 01:21:40.590
Here.

01:21:40.675 --> 01:21:42.343
Is this human trafficking?

01:21:42.428 --> 01:21:45.513
You're not gonna keep it
and sell me to a gang of Albanians

01:21:45.597 --> 01:21:47.807
who'll make me pleasure 25 truck drivers a day

01:21:47.891 --> 01:21:50.977
at some port in Belgium
for me to earn it back, are you?

01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:53.896
No, no. Absolutely not.

01:21:54.565 --> 01:21:56.357
It's a terrible situation, though.

01:21:57.068 --> 01:21:58.777
Those women...

01:21:59.571 --> 01:22:04.199
I can't help but think they all just
started life as someone's little baby.

01:22:06.953 --> 01:22:08.078
He's still not picking up.

01:22:09.414 --> 01:22:10.539
He's never usually late.

01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:13.042
God, can we start without him?
I'm starving.

01:22:13.126 --> 01:22:14.585
We've been here forever.

01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:16.920
I can't believe he's late
for our first-anniversary dinner.

01:22:17.088 --> 01:22:18.464
I can't believe you even made it...

01:22:18.548 --> 01:22:20.549
...to your first-anniversary dinner.

01:22:21.092 --> 01:22:22.302
- What?
- Hmm?

01:22:22.428 --> 01:22:23.428
Mmm?

01:22:26.182 --> 01:22:30.435
Well, one year is pretty remarkable,

01:22:30.644 --> 01:22:33.397
given that you two are completely
ill-suited for one another, isn't it?

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:35.358
I mean, no one thought
you were gonna make it a month,

01:22:35.442 --> 01:22:36.484
much less a year.

01:22:36.568 --> 01:22:37.610
Really?

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:40.321
I didn't actually think you'd make it
past the honeymoon, honestly.

01:22:40.405 --> 01:22:41.697
I thought you'd fuck a Moroccan.

01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:42.823
- Whoa.
- I really did.

01:22:42.908 --> 01:22:43.908
And I wouldn't have blamed you

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.868
because they're very beguiling, the Moroccans.

01:22:45.952 --> 01:22:49.288
If you sort of like the swarthy gentleman.

01:22:49.623 --> 01:22:51.624
- Thanks. And no, I don't.
- That's not your thing?

01:22:51.708 --> 01:22:53.542
- No.
- Ooh. A bit racist?

01:22:53.627 --> 01:22:55.961
I bet you'd do it. You'd do it
with a foreign fellow, wouldn't you?

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.130
What about the Chinese fellows?

01:22:58.256 --> 01:23:00.383
Because they've not got
a great reputation as lovers.

01:23:00.467 --> 01:23:03.345
But they must be doing something right,
because there's billions of them.

01:23:03.471 --> 01:23:05.263
You've got your Germans. Ach!
Very efficient.

01:23:05.348 --> 01:23:08.476
Like
a machine, just... In and out.

01:23:08.602 --> 01:23:10.311
"I vill annex your vagina!

01:23:10.396 --> 01:23:12.397
"And then Poland!"
No, forgive and forget.

01:23:12.481 --> 01:23:14.065
But d'you know what?
I don't know about you,

01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:16.609
I've never met someone
who's had sex with an Eskimo.

01:23:16.693 --> 01:23:18.319
Be good, wouldn't it?
Because they'd start with the noses

01:23:18.404 --> 01:23:20.488
and then they'd, ooh, get down,
you know, with the...

01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:24.784
Do you think they do that down there?
Not using the... Just... On the nose.

01:23:26.078 --> 01:23:27.829
I bet you've had a few of them, yeah.
And him.

01:23:27.913 --> 01:23:29.080
No, good luck to you.

01:23:30.165 --> 01:23:33.209
- Thanks.
- But, I mean, you did it. One year!

01:23:33.293 --> 01:23:34.419
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:23:34.503 --> 01:23:36.170
Don't you clap.

01:23:37.089 --> 01:23:39.090
Go on, give that twat of a husband another call.

01:23:39.174 --> 01:23:40.258
Don't use your phone, use mine.

01:23:40.342 --> 01:23:43.220
Because sometimes he avoids you if he
sees your name come up on the caller ID.

01:24:22.345 --> 01:24:25.515
Oh, God. Happy anniversary!

01:24:29.812 --> 01:24:31.813
Naomi arranged it.

01:24:33.191 --> 01:24:34.983
Happy one year.

01:24:35.818 --> 01:24:37.235
I need to tell you something, Nat.

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:41.740
I just think you're the most incredible woman.

01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:44.117
- Aw!
- How about that?

01:24:44.202 --> 01:24:46.119
So beautiful.

01:24:46.496 --> 01:24:49.456
And smart and bright and funny.

01:24:50.208 --> 01:24:51.291
You're perfect.

01:24:52.376 --> 01:24:54.712
- You're the perfect wife.
- Aw, sweet.

01:24:58.050 --> 01:24:59.133
But just not for me.

01:25:01.053 --> 01:25:03.429
I've waited my whole life
for the right girl to show up.

01:25:03.847 --> 01:25:05.599
And it turns out that you weren't it.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:09.269
I don't find the way that you crinkle
your nose when you laugh adorable,

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:10.646
the way you flick your hair,

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.231
- it's quite frankly irritating.
- Hear, hear.

01:25:12.315 --> 01:25:14.316
I wanted to cherish everything about you,

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.361
but it just didn't happen.

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:21.406
So I guess what I'm trying to say is...

01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:23.951
Natasha Moss...

01:25:25.411 --> 01:25:26.745
will you divorce me?

01:25:29.082 --> 01:25:30.500
Yes.

01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:33.169
Yes. Yes! I will!

01:25:33.254 --> 01:25:35.004
- I absolutely will!
- That's so amazing!

01:25:35.089 --> 01:25:36.839
- Do you really mean it?
- Absolutely!

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:40.009
I've been waiting for this moment
for months, hoping it would happen.

01:25:40.094 --> 01:25:41.386
I can't believe that you asked me.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.929
Why didn't you just say something, then?

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:45.933
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
I thought it would break your heart.

01:25:46.268 --> 01:25:49.645
You've made me the happiest woman in the world.

01:25:50.772 --> 01:25:51.814
I love you.

01:25:52.148 --> 01:25:53.274
But you're not in love with me.

01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:55.526
No! God, no.

01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:57.486
Unequivocally not in love with you.

01:25:57.862 --> 01:26:00.030
The opposite. The opposite of love.
Misery.

01:26:00.115 --> 01:26:02.032
Me, too!

01:26:02.784 --> 01:26:04.952
I can't believe we felt the same for so long.

01:26:05.036 --> 01:26:08.832
Well, listen, now we have the rest of our lives

01:26:09.208 --> 01:26:10.500
not to be together.

01:26:13.588 --> 01:26:14.921
Cheers?

01:26:15.006 --> 01:26:17.257
Look, this is amazing, it's magical.

01:26:17.341 --> 01:26:18.508
It's better than I could ever have imagined,

01:26:18.593 --> 01:26:20.385
but there's somewhere else
that I really need to be right now.

01:26:20.469 --> 01:26:22.596
Oh, go! Seriously, go.
Do you need money for a cab?

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.722
No, I'm all right, I'm in the car,

01:26:23.806 --> 01:26:25.725
but it was a nightmare trying to park,
so I'm basically in a...

01:26:25.809 --> 01:26:28.936
Oh, God, stop it. Stop it.
It's so boring.

01:26:29.021 --> 01:26:30.730
- It's just, the car's in your name...
- It's so boring.

01:26:30.814 --> 01:26:32.898
- We should sort that out, actually.
- It's so boring. I don't care.

01:26:32.983 --> 01:26:35.067
- All right, but...
- Honestly. Just go.

01:26:48.499 --> 01:26:51.335
I will never have to see you again.

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.920
Ever.

01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:00.510
Taxi!

01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:17.946
Ta-da!

01:27:18.531 --> 01:27:20.115
Oh, wow!

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.743
I've always wanted to go to Aachen.

01:27:24.746 --> 01:27:27.289
No, uh, we're going to Paris.

01:27:27.415 --> 01:27:28.666
Paris.

01:27:29.668 --> 01:27:32.628
Ah! Okay. Joke!

01:27:33.213 --> 01:27:34.755
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

01:27:48.688 --> 01:27:50.689
- I'm thinking two kids.
- Oh!

01:27:50.773 --> 01:27:53.651
- Guy Junior and Gaia.
- Wait! Wait, stop!

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:55.861
- Stand back.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:57.239 --> 01:27:58.864
I can't be without you, Chloe.

01:27:59.449 --> 01:28:01.033
I think about you every second of the day.

01:28:02.452 --> 01:28:03.577
I need to be with you.

01:28:04.121 --> 01:28:05.371
And I know you want to be with me as well.

01:28:05.455 --> 01:28:06.622
What the hell are you doing?

01:28:06.707 --> 01:28:09.166
You can't just turn up
and try and steal my girlfriend away.

01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:11.419
You're married. You're a married man.

01:28:11.461 --> 01:28:13.129
You should get out of here, creep.

01:28:13.547 --> 01:28:14.547
I split up with Nat.

01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:16.966
- You split up with Nat?
- You split up with Nat?

01:28:17.342 --> 01:28:19.969
Ever since you came back into my life,
I've known that I had to be with you.

01:28:21.972 --> 01:28:24.557
When I lie in bed,
I think about the way that you laugh.

01:28:25.142 --> 01:28:28.187
I can't work because I can't stop
imagining our lives together.

01:28:29.106 --> 01:28:32.608
You're everything that I've ever wanted in a...

01:28:34.153 --> 01:28:36.779
- Nat?!
- Josh? What...

01:28:39.032 --> 01:28:40.908
What? What?

01:28:41.118 --> 01:28:42.410
Okay, sorry.

01:28:44.496 --> 01:28:47.790
Nat, we spoke about this, didn't we?

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:50.042
- It's not gonna work out.
- No, I, uh...

01:28:50.127 --> 01:28:51.461
- Actually, I'm...
- I'm not gonna change my mind.

01:28:51.587 --> 01:28:53.963
- I don't care what you say.
- I'm, uh...

01:28:55.007 --> 01:28:57.592
- I'm not here to see you.
- What are you doing?

01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:59.469
I'm actually not here to see you.

01:28:59.553 --> 01:29:01.387
What do you mean,
you're not actually here to see me?

01:29:02.347 --> 01:29:03.849
Him!

01:29:04.225 --> 01:29:05.517
- Really?
- And you...

01:29:05.894 --> 01:29:07.854
- Her, yeah.
- Her, of course.

01:29:07.938 --> 01:29:09.397
You're perfect for each other.

01:29:09.482 --> 01:29:12.567
And I always thought he was much more
the kind of guy that you should go for.

01:29:12.651 --> 01:29:14.277
Do you remember when I said to you
when I was trying to...

01:29:14.361 --> 01:29:15.945
Oh, I do remember that!
I remember when you said that,

01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:17.614
and at the time, I agreed.

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:18.782
And I thought in my mind,

01:29:18.866 --> 01:29:20.033
"I think he's right,
I should be with him."

01:29:20.117 --> 01:29:22.911
That's what I wanted.

01:29:22.995 --> 01:29:25.288
Ah! And here we are.

01:29:25.664 --> 01:29:26.748
Here we are.

01:29:27.458 --> 01:29:30.460
And where were you?
Had you been explaining

01:29:30.544 --> 01:29:32.462
- the bit about us...
- Us breaking up, yeah.

01:29:32.588 --> 01:29:34.798
I was just explaining to Chloe
why I was in love with her.

01:29:36.926 --> 01:29:40.721
Okay, is it just me,
or is this unbelievably awkward?

01:29:40.806 --> 01:29:41.972
Look at that.

01:29:42.057 --> 01:29:43.891
She's got that dry sense of humour
that you like.

01:29:43.975 --> 01:29:45.893
I mean, I just don't have that.

01:29:45.977 --> 01:29:50.106
And this guy, forget about it.
Unbelievable.

01:29:50.733 --> 01:29:52.901
Proper grade-A hunk.

01:29:52.985 --> 01:29:54.444
I could just drink you in.

01:29:55.029 --> 01:29:56.488
Thanks.

01:29:58.074 --> 01:30:02.244
But this lady here, she's incredible.

01:30:03.162 --> 01:30:05.914
And you make her eyes light up
in a way that I never could.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.921
Would you mind...

01:30:13.005 --> 01:30:15.091
No, no, uh... please.

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:17.051
Would it be all right if I...

01:30:17.135 --> 01:30:18.511
Of course.

01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:20.721
Thank you.

01:30:26.395 --> 01:30:27.854
- Thank you.
- Oh!

01:30:27.938 --> 01:30:30.023
- That's nice.
- Sorry.

01:30:31.776 --> 01:30:34.236
No, not you, we don't want to do that.

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.780
Never again. Come around this side.

01:30:36.865 --> 01:30:38.532
Hi.

01:30:45.415 --> 01:30:47.291
- This is a bit weird.
- This is weird, isn't it?

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:48.792
- Yeah.
- We'll go.

01:30:48.877 --> 01:30:50.628
- Let's go over here.
- No, we'll go.

01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:39.721
- Who had the chicken feet?
- I did.

01:31:39.805 --> 01:31:41.306
You had the chicken feet.

01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:43.683
- We didn't have a starter.
- No, no.

01:31:43.768 --> 01:31:46.019
And we didn't have the champagne.

01:31:46.103 --> 01:31:49.565
We spent £45,000 on a wedding to your prick son!

01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:52.860
You can chip in for a bit of fucking dim sum!

01:32:22.558 --> 01:32:23.892
All right, pause, pause, pause.

01:32:23.977 --> 01:32:25.018
I'll tell you what we'll do.

01:32:25.103 --> 01:32:28.605
We'll make a list of
pros and cons, right, of Nat.

01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:32.735
Pros. Number one, body.

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:35.738
Excellent. I've seen it nude, loved it.

01:32:35.823 --> 01:32:37.533
I beg your pardon?
When have you seen it nude?

01:32:37.826 --> 01:32:40.244
Well, when we were
down in that place in Cornwall,

01:32:40.328 --> 01:32:42.121
I sort of walked in
when she was getting changed.

01:32:42.205 --> 01:32:43.580
- What do you mean, you walked in...
- "Accidentally."

01:32:43.665 --> 01:32:45.874
- What's that? What's that?
- Hey, listen, I'll tell you,

01:32:45.959 --> 01:32:49.169
you lock your door
or these peepers will come a-roving.

01:32:49.337 --> 01:32:52.172
All right, mate? That's the way I roll.

01:32:52.257 --> 01:32:53.924
You know that, she should know that.

01:32:54.009 --> 01:32:56.301
What about that she's, um...

01:32:57.554 --> 01:32:59.096
- Kind...
- Boring.

01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.764
...and warm.

01:33:00.849 --> 01:33:02.808
Warm?
Put the radiator on if you want warm.

01:33:02.892 --> 01:33:04.893
And, um, good with kids.

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.187
So was Michael Jackson.
Look at that marriage. It didn't last.

01:33:08.857 --> 01:33:09.857
Yeah, but I love her.

01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:11.443
- Love.
- Well, I do.

01:33:11.527 --> 01:33:12.737
Yeah, sounds a bit gay.

01:33:13.196 --> 01:33:14.447
We can get back out there like the lads.

01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:16.949
Like the old days, you know?
The Terrible Two.

01:33:17.034 --> 01:33:18.034
Do you know what I mean?

01:33:18.118 --> 01:33:19.952
"Lock up your daughters.
And your mothers."

01:33:20.037 --> 01:33:21.287
I'm not fussy.

01:33:21.621 --> 01:33:23.664
Every time I open my mouth
when I'm around her, she's like,

01:33:23.749 --> 01:33:25.916
"No, don't say that.
You can't say that.

01:33:26.001 --> 01:33:27.043
"You can't do that.

01:33:27.377 --> 01:33:30.296
"Put your trousers on! Put your
trousers on! We're in a restaurant!"

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.631
- Oh, shut up.
- Well, she's...
