00:45.362 --> 00:47.171
I'm in hell.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.425
You mind keeping it down?

00:59.752 --> 01:01.209
Well, I just don't get it.

01:01.211 --> 01:04.116
It's practical, economical,
and user-friendly.

01:04.117 --> 01:06.217
Mm. Yeah, man, you're
preaching to the choir.

01:06.219 --> 01:07.641
There is no good reason

01:07.643 --> 01:09.718
why America hasn't embraced the spork.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.903
Yeah.

01:10.905 --> 01:14.289
Mikey, what's your take on the spork?

01:14.291 --> 01:15.316
- The spork?
- Mm-hmm.

01:15.318 --> 01:16.600
Oh, I think he took

01:16.602 --> 01:18.727
way too much attention away from Buzz.

01:18.729 --> 01:19.936
Ah.

01:19.938 --> 01:22.581
I didn't sleep well last night.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.107
Ah, what's keeping you up?

01:24.109 --> 01:26.276
My wife's snoring.

01:26.278 --> 01:28.695
Awake, she's the most
elegant woman ever.

01:28.697 --> 01:32.282
Asleep, she's like a
blender full of nails.

01:32.284 --> 01:34.479
Is there something wrong
with her? This is a new thing?

01:34.481 --> 01:36.057
She's always snored,
I just didn't notice it,

01:36.059 --> 01:38.242
but now I do, 'cause I'm getting
up three times a night to pee.

01:38.244 --> 01:39.340
Oh.

01:39.342 --> 01:40.957
Only three times?

01:40.959 --> 01:43.102
I'm about to start
sleeping in the bathroom.

01:43.104 --> 01:46.347
You have spare bedrooms in that house.

01:46.349 --> 01:47.923
Try sleeping in one of those.

01:47.925 --> 01:50.717
Yeah, couples sleep in
separate bedrooms all the time.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.344
They're called "apart-ners".

01:53.931 --> 01:57.099
Gwyneth Paltrow and her husband
swear by it. Yeah, I've...

01:57.101 --> 02:00.453
Someone left a People
magazine in the john.

02:00.455 --> 02:02.429
Well, if there's any group of people

02:02.431 --> 02:03.956
who I want to emulate their lifestyle,

02:03.958 --> 02:06.108
it's those left-wing
loonies out in Hollywood.

02:06.110 --> 02:10.128
Hey, hey, hey, Carol and I
sleep in separate bedrooms.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.881
The woman kicks like a
professional soccer player,

02:12.883 --> 02:15.325
and I got tired of being the ball.

02:15.327 --> 02:17.926
What about the fun
part of sharing a bed?

02:17.928 --> 02:20.381
Hmm? Like, like spooning?

02:20.383 --> 02:22.099
Or sporking?

02:23.719 --> 02:25.824
No, seriously, have you
ever brought up the idea

02:25.826 --> 02:27.671
of separate bedrooms to Vanessa?

02:27.673 --> 02:29.645
It would be too strange.
After 30 years of marriage,

02:29.647 --> 02:31.675
I-I couldn't do it. I mean, maybe...

02:31.677 --> 02:33.986
Does it surprise you
guys? I don't like change.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.864
Hmm, we know. You still
have an AOL account.

02:40.811 --> 02:42.769
So, what'd you guys
think of the vegan chili?

02:42.771 --> 02:44.163
Oh, it was great.

02:44.165 --> 02:47.816
If you make it again, I'd
add a little more salt.

02:47.818 --> 02:49.710
And ground beef.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.580
Hope you guys saved room for dessert.

02:53.582 --> 02:55.991
Oh, uh, yeah, and this is
not just any type of dessert.

02:55.993 --> 02:57.993
It is a very special cake.

02:57.995 --> 02:59.011
You made it?

02:59.013 --> 03:00.846
Oh, goody.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.182
A cake without the things
that make cake "cake".

03:05.353 --> 03:08.044
"Will you be our baby's godparents?"

03:08.046 --> 03:10.446
Godparents. Are you serious?

03:10.448 --> 03:11.448
Dead serious.

03:11.450 --> 03:14.551
Now, do we bake you a
cake that says "yes"?

03:14.553 --> 03:18.364
I thought aunt was a
good job, but godparents?

03:18.366 --> 03:22.058
A parent sent by God.

03:22.060 --> 03:23.894
Uh, yeah. You guys
were our first choice.

03:23.896 --> 03:27.373
Well, I asked the Obamas...
knew it was a long shot.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.858
I don't know anything
about being a godfather.

03:29.860 --> 03:33.045
I guess I'll have to watch that movie.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.621
The Godfather.

03:34.623 --> 03:37.499
No. No-no research necessary.

03:37.501 --> 03:38.659
You guys are gonna be great.

03:38.661 --> 03:41.806
Oh, I can't wait. I'm
gonna do so many things

03:41.808 --> 03:43.079
for my little goddaughter.

03:43.081 --> 03:45.632
Decorate her little nursery,

03:45.634 --> 03:47.250
buy her little shoes,

03:47.252 --> 03:49.313
style her little hair
with a little comb,

03:49.315 --> 03:50.719
with a little brush,
with a little... Ooh!

03:50.721 --> 03:52.473
I'm so excited.

03:52.475 --> 03:54.758
She's very lucky to have you both.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.817
I mean, you think they
would have at least

03:56.819 --> 03:58.386
responded with a form letter.

03:58.388 --> 04:00.698
It just doesn't seem like Michelle.

04:06.989 --> 04:08.230
You okay?

04:08.232 --> 04:09.823
Something bothering you?

04:09.825 --> 04:12.275
Yeah, just thinking about

04:12.277 --> 04:15.004
what a selfish S.O.B. I am.

04:15.998 --> 04:18.281
Never bothered you before.

04:18.283 --> 04:21.594
Um... what-what do you
mean, you're selfish?

04:21.596 --> 04:24.838
I just don't know how I can sleep

04:24.840 --> 04:27.341
knowing all the noise I
make is gonna, you know,

04:27.343 --> 04:29.417
keep you awake.

04:29.419 --> 04:32.605
Oh, no, don't-don't
worry. It's not that bad.

04:32.607 --> 04:34.681
Sleeping with me, it's-it's...

04:34.683 --> 04:36.819
it's got to be like sleeping, you know,

04:36.821 --> 04:39.094
with a blender full of nails.

04:39.096 --> 04:41.855
Or, you know, or whatever
you think I sound like.

04:41.857 --> 04:44.677
You know, it's your bed, too.

04:44.679 --> 04:46.082
Don't-don't worry about me.

04:46.084 --> 04:48.028
Damn it, I will worry about you.

04:48.030 --> 04:51.532
Honey, tonight I'm gonna just
sleep in Mandy's old room.

04:51.534 --> 04:54.609
Well, honey, I don't care
if you wake me, I swear.

04:54.611 --> 04:56.485
- I-I...
- Listen, you're just an angel.

04:56.487 --> 04:58.705
You are an angel, and the
last thing you want to do

04:58.707 --> 05:00.960
in this world is wake an angel.

05:00.962 --> 05:02.044
It's in the Bible.

05:02.046 --> 05:03.146
Honey, I...

05:09.980 --> 05:11.502
Hey, Jen.

05:11.504 --> 05:14.463
How are you this lovely, fine day, huh?

05:15.149 --> 05:16.298
Confused.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.894
Were you whistling?

05:17.896 --> 05:19.634
Yes, I was whistling. Why
wouldn't I be whistling?

05:19.636 --> 05:21.562
Sun's out, birds are singing.

05:21.564 --> 05:25.282
It's a beautiful zip-a-dee-doo-dah day.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.926
Why are you so happy?

05:28.928 --> 05:31.428
Are you sending me back to Hong Kong?

05:32.649 --> 05:35.652
I haven't slept this well in months.

05:35.654 --> 05:37.435
I feel like a young Mike Baxter.

05:37.437 --> 05:38.912
And not just because I had a dream

05:38.914 --> 05:41.323
about me being on my Kawasaki triple,

05:41.325 --> 05:43.491
Stevie Nicks holding on tight,

05:43.493 --> 05:46.328
whispering sweet stuff in my ear.

05:46.330 --> 05:48.806
He sounds like a cool guy.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.684
Coffee?

05:51.686 --> 05:53.425
No, no. I don't need coffee.

05:53.427 --> 05:56.046
I'm full of energy, hope, optimism.

05:56.048 --> 05:59.400
I-I could... I could
almost vote for a Democrat.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.344
If I slept like this all the time,

06:02.346 --> 06:04.346
what-what couldn't I accomplish?

06:04.348 --> 06:07.441
Get the summit of Everest,
you know, write my memoirs,

06:07.443 --> 06:10.226
finally quarterback for the Broncos.

06:10.228 --> 06:13.038
Flacco, I'm coming for you, buddy.

06:14.617 --> 06:16.041
Ugh.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.951
- Good morning, Vanessa.
- Ugh!

06:17.953 --> 06:19.194
You didn't sleep well?

06:19.196 --> 06:21.404
No, not a wink. You know,

06:21.406 --> 06:23.624
it was sweet of you to
try a separate bedroom,

06:23.626 --> 06:26.552
but obviously we will
never do that again.

06:32.084 --> 06:34.518
Tonight you ride alone, Stevie.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.141
Here you go, Ed.

06:41.143 --> 06:42.884
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.886 --> 06:44.069
Is Mike in yet?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.054
No.

06:46.056 --> 06:48.765
You think we gave him
good advice yesterday, Ed?

06:48.767 --> 06:51.893
Hmm? Honestly, I do not know.

06:51.895 --> 06:54.997
Uh, what did we tell him again?

06:56.608 --> 06:59.326
We told him to try separate beds, Ed.

06:59.328 --> 07:02.779
Well, I'm sorry I
have a life. Excuse me.

07:02.781 --> 07:04.906
I mean, I love the guy,
but I don't sit around

07:04.908 --> 07:06.258
thinking about him all day long.

07:07.336 --> 07:10.837
Yeah, me neither.

07:10.839 --> 07:14.016
Hey, boys. Guess what I ate
my eggs with this morning.

07:15.127 --> 07:16.459
A spork.

07:18.180 --> 07:19.963
Oh, you're in a good mood.

07:19.965 --> 07:22.107
I guess the separate
bedrooms idea worked.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.134
Well, not for Vanessa.

07:24.136 --> 07:26.687
She hated it so much she
never wants to do that again.

07:26.689 --> 07:28.763
Do you know how awful it feels

07:28.765 --> 07:30.616
to be in paradise just for a moment,

07:30.618 --> 07:32.142
then get kicked out on your ass?

07:32.144 --> 07:33.527
Yes, I do.

07:33.529 --> 07:36.438
Jimmy Buffett concert, 1997.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.667
Apparently I was
dancing too suggestively.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.628
I'm just gonna tell her she snores.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.654
No, no, no, that's-that's a bad idea.

07:44.656 --> 07:47.800
Uh, truth in marriage only
works out for one person:

07:47.802 --> 07:49.385
the divorce lawyer.

07:50.454 --> 07:52.216
Yeah, man, think about it.

07:52.218 --> 07:54.881
There's got to be a reason
why you never told her before.

07:54.883 --> 07:57.391
Yeah, because my wife
is an extremely kind

07:57.393 --> 07:58.485
and caring individual.

07:58.487 --> 08:00.837
I would never do anything
to hurt her feelings.

08:00.839 --> 08:02.338
But?

08:02.340 --> 08:04.132
But I had a good night's sleep.

08:04.134 --> 08:07.024
I think she can handle it.

08:07.026 --> 08:08.924
Well, it'll definitely

08:08.926 --> 08:10.656
land them in separate bedrooms.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.899
You're still on that?

08:12.901 --> 08:14.576
Get a life.

08:18.591 --> 08:20.714
- Hey. What you doing?
- Hey.

08:20.716 --> 08:22.576
Decorating the nursery.

08:22.578 --> 08:27.197
Oh. So my daughter's first
bedroom is going to be pink.

08:27.199 --> 08:28.823
Well, you're having a girl.

08:28.825 --> 08:30.008
Duh.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.868
Uh, and it's not just pink.

08:31.870 --> 08:34.669
It is Flamingo, Cotton Candy,
Bubble Gum, and Ballet Slipper.

08:36.707 --> 08:38.875
Yeah, those are as different
as night and evening.

08:38.876 --> 08:41.615
Um, hey, look, Mandy,

08:41.616 --> 08:44.876
I-I really wanted a non-gender-
specific nursery for our baby.

08:44.878 --> 08:47.383
I-I don't want the decor to
put any limitations on her.

08:47.385 --> 08:50.053
It doesn't. This room
tells her she's a princess.

08:50.055 --> 08:52.722
Princesses set fashion
trends, they start diet fads.

08:52.724 --> 08:54.775
If that's not power, then what is?

08:54.777 --> 08:57.018
Okay, um...

08:57.020 --> 08:58.817
look, just imagine a generation

08:58.819 --> 09:01.281
that isn't locked into
these outdated stereotypes.

09:01.283 --> 09:03.876
I really want my daughter
to be a part of that, and...

09:03.878 --> 09:06.620
she can't do that from
underneath a pink blanket.

09:06.622 --> 09:09.096
This is Blushing Cherry Blossom.

09:09.098 --> 09:10.573
Are you blind?

09:10.575 --> 09:14.183
Well, it's my baby, my house,
and you're just the decorator.

09:14.185 --> 09:15.268
I'm not just the decorator.

09:15.270 --> 09:16.388
I am not just the aunt.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.206
I am the godmother to a princess!

09:18.208 --> 09:19.649
Get out of my fairy tale!

09:20.544 --> 09:23.353
Whoa. What's with all the yelling?

09:23.355 --> 09:25.637
Uh, your sister is imposing archaic,

09:25.639 --> 09:28.258
patriarchal strictures
on our unborn daughter.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.360
And Ryan is being a butt.

09:32.055 --> 09:34.223
Well, knock it off, both of you.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.576
Okay? This baby, and having
you and Kyle be the godparents,

09:37.578 --> 09:40.562
is about bringing us
all together as a family.

09:40.564 --> 09:41.604
- Okay...
- Yeah, but...

09:41.606 --> 09:43.231
I don't want to hear it! Okay?

09:43.233 --> 09:44.566
You need to work this out.

09:44.568 --> 09:47.110
I am not letting the two
of you ruin this for me.

09:47.112 --> 09:50.047
My body is flooded with love hormones!

09:53.743 --> 09:54.760
Hi.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.428
- How was work? Hey.
- Well...

09:56.430 --> 10:00.290
- Mwah. Oh.
- Work was the usual.

10:00.292 --> 10:02.584
You know, taxing.

10:02.586 --> 10:05.011
Everybody coming to me

10:05.013 --> 10:07.606
to solve their relationship problems.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.516
Coming to you?

10:09.518 --> 10:11.235
Why, were there no
brick walls to talk to?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.948
Oh, man.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.600
You are beautiful, funny,

10:18.602 --> 10:21.453
and so understanding.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.770
Mike?

10:22.772 --> 10:24.581
You snore.

10:26.823 --> 10:28.254
What?

10:28.256 --> 10:29.986
Yeah, you-you've been
snoring a lot lately.

10:29.988 --> 10:33.156
I mean, with an extraordinary
amount of gusto, I might add.

10:33.158 --> 10:36.284
No, I don't think I snore.

10:36.286 --> 10:37.861
I-I beg to differ.

10:37.863 --> 10:41.306
I think I'd get the neighbors
on both sides of us to agree.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.218
And possibly the U.S.
Geological Service.

10:45.220 --> 10:47.890
So is this what all that nonsense was

10:47.892 --> 10:49.464
about separate bedrooms?

10:49.466 --> 10:51.275
You said you didn't want to disturb me.

10:52.895 --> 10:55.529
That's called lying.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.491
Well, why did you feel you had to lie?

10:59.493 --> 11:02.235
If you'd just told me
I snore, I would stop.

11:04.689 --> 11:06.856
Y-You would just stop.

11:06.858 --> 11:08.858
Yes.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.319
Vanessa...

11:11.321 --> 11:13.363
people spend billions of dollars a year

11:13.365 --> 11:16.341
trying to ease their snoring,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.677
but you...

11:18.679 --> 11:21.513
can just stop.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.668
Yeah, of course I can, and after I do,

11:26.670 --> 11:29.504
we're gonna drop all this talk
about separate bedrooms, okay?

11:29.506 --> 11:30.880
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:30.882 --> 11:33.341
So this is honesty.

11:33.343 --> 11:34.693
God.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.612
No wonder nobody does it.

12:28.898 --> 12:30.666
- Morning.
- Hey.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.649
It's so cold.

13:13.651 --> 13:17.278
Here, come over here and
sit down. Come-come on.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.673
Come on, Vanessa, sit down.
I'll make us something.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.264
- There you go, come on, sit for a second.
- Oh, yeah.

13:26.266 --> 13:28.807
You're right, you're
right. This is much better.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.309
You...

13:33.129 --> 13:36.815
- Catch me!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.674
You startled me. Listen...

13:38.676 --> 13:41.584
Listen, I'm-I'm... You
didn't sleep so well.

13:41.586 --> 13:43.581
O-Or you slept so well
while you were sleeping,

13:43.583 --> 13:44.823
somebody stole your mind?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.856
Okay, fine.

13:46.858 --> 13:48.827
All right, maybe I-I
had a rough night, honey.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.311
One rough night?

13:50.313 --> 13:52.814
I don't... One, two, four, I...

13:52.816 --> 13:54.499
Don't make me count. I...

13:54.501 --> 13:57.836
Baby, we can't keep doing
this. We've got to do something.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.746
I know. Look, just, Mike, no-no,

13:59.748 --> 14:01.447
not separate bedrooms again, okay?

14:01.449 --> 14:03.699
I-I don't want to sleep without you.

14:03.701 --> 14:06.086
I-I mean, when I was doing all
the roadwork for Outdoor Man,

14:06.088 --> 14:07.420
I was gone forever. You slept good then.

14:07.422 --> 14:09.205
No, I know, but it
wasn't a problem then.

14:09.207 --> 14:11.040
Yes, you were gone, but...

14:11.042 --> 14:13.685
I knew you were coming back.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.762
I-I'm not going anywhere,
I'm just down the hall.

14:15.764 --> 14:17.672
Yeah, right. You're
right, in the kids' room,

14:17.674 --> 14:19.024
because they left.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.009
Mike, so much has changed in our lives.

14:22.011 --> 14:24.554
Don't-don't... don't change this, too.

14:24.556 --> 14:26.222
I won't, I won't.

14:26.224 --> 14:28.558
But I-I want you to be able to sleep.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.276
You probably shouldn't have told me

14:30.278 --> 14:32.598
that it breaks your heart if
I sleep in another room, then.

14:34.157 --> 14:36.041
We're gonna take care of
this. We're gonna do something.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.025
We'll-we'll figure this out.
We'll figure this out, okay?

14:38.027 --> 14:39.402
- Hmm, mm-hmm.
- Good.

14:39.404 --> 14:41.404
All right, well, I'm just
gonna, uh, take a shower

14:41.406 --> 14:42.772
- and try to wake up.
- Great, great.

14:42.774 --> 14:45.050
And I'll make us some
eggs, you come back down...

14:45.052 --> 14:48.428
You can go to the shower up
where it usually is, upstairs.

14:52.467 --> 14:55.635
What even was the name of that
store, Crappy's House of Crap?

14:55.637 --> 14:58.719
Fine, Mandy. You didn't like
the rug that I picked out.

14:58.721 --> 15:00.529
Forgive me for wanting to have any say

15:00.531 --> 15:02.219
in what my daughter's
room is going to look like.

15:02.221 --> 15:03.710
Well, of course I forgive you, Ryan.

15:03.712 --> 15:05.152
It's your taste that's unforgivable.

15:07.393 --> 15:09.083
I know, we're not
supposed to be arguing.

15:09.085 --> 15:10.394
Just forget you saw that.

15:10.396 --> 15:14.231
I'm afraid I can't.
It's out of my hands.

15:14.233 --> 15:17.192
What? What does that mean?

15:18.290 --> 15:21.267
The Godfather would
like to see you both.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.945
How did things ever get so far?

15:32.515 --> 15:34.890
I don't know. It's so unfortunate,

15:34.892 --> 15:39.112
so unnecessary.

15:39.114 --> 15:40.730
Kyle, what are you... ?

15:40.732 --> 15:41.790
Eh...

15:43.877 --> 15:46.452
We are en familia, in the family,

15:46.454 --> 15:49.530
but these things that
you're saying to one another,

15:49.532 --> 15:51.457
they're the-the words of strangers,

15:51.459 --> 15:54.010
the words of animals.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.643
And now I hear you're
fighting over a rug.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.138
A rug.

16:05.140 --> 16:08.090
Yeah, but it was super ugly.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.151
This... this is super ugly.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.765
Uh, okay, uh, Kyle...
glad you liked the movie.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.726
I watched them all. They were awesome.

16:18.728 --> 16:22.396
Um, but this is our baby.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.825
Okay, uh, why did you even
make me the godmother, then?

16:25.827 --> 16:27.568
You know, I don't know.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.111
I don't even know what we were thinking.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.571
Ryan, stop.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.832
No, you know exactly
what we were thinking.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.576
- Why don't-why don't you just tell her?
- What? No.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.578
I'm not gonna do that.
It doesn't matter.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.265
Ryan, I'm gonna make
you an offer that you...

16:40.267 --> 16:42.017
Okay, enough.

16:44.179 --> 16:47.347
Ryan, just-just tell
her what you said to me.

16:47.349 --> 16:49.107
I don't even remember, exactly.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.966
Okay, fine, I do.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.520
You said that if you could
give our daughter the secret

16:54.522 --> 16:56.689
that is inside of Mandy,

16:56.691 --> 16:58.766
the thing that makes her so alive

16:58.768 --> 17:01.786
and so in love with the world,

17:01.788 --> 17:04.873
it would be the best gift
we could ever give her.

17:06.034 --> 17:07.291
You said that?

17:08.462 --> 17:10.545
I don't know. I guess.

17:11.539 --> 17:13.631
Okay, I did.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.992
Oh, boy, here it comes.

17:16.993 --> 17:20.663
So, if the two of you
could... I don't know...

17:20.665 --> 17:22.173
work together on this, yeah?

17:22.175 --> 17:24.116
Yeah, we should. We should.

17:24.117 --> 17:27.479
The-the rug wasn't horrible.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.964
Thank you. Uh, but maybe the one

17:29.966 --> 17:31.486
with the pink pattern would be better.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.560
- Back to the store?
- Okay.

17:34.562 --> 17:36.303
Okay.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.190
Thanks.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.517
Thank you for stepping in, Godfather.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.912
- Just when I think I'm out, they pull me...
- Nope!

17:46.482 --> 17:47.740
I just want you to know

17:47.742 --> 17:49.859
I-I will move heaven and earth

17:49.861 --> 17:51.911
to keep sharing the bed
with my lovely wife, okay?

17:51.913 --> 17:54.363
Oh, honey, that is so
sweet of you to say.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.508
So-so, am I supposed to just forget

17:56.510 --> 17:58.259
that you said I sound like a pig farm?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.013
Pretty sure I said slaughterhouse.

18:03.425 --> 18:07.093
Oh, wow. Look at that bed.

18:07.095 --> 18:10.188
So this is why you kept me
out of the house all day.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.190
Right. Our old one's
on the way to the dump

18:12.192 --> 18:14.692
to make a fine home for some stray cats.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.937
Oh, look at this. Gosh,
just like a hospital bed

18:17.939 --> 18:20.365
except, you know, without
all the pain of childbirth.

18:21.443 --> 18:23.058
Well, I did a little research.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.727
It turns out changing
your sleep position

18:24.729 --> 18:25.884
can help with your snoring,

18:25.886 --> 18:29.023
and this thing goes from flat to taco.

18:30.952 --> 18:33.068
Honey, this is so thoughtful.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.362
Um, you want to, you
want to push a button

18:35.364 --> 18:38.124
before my forehead touches my knees?

18:38.126 --> 18:41.076
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah,
h-ho... There we go.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.579
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.039
Ooh!

18:45.041 --> 18:48.375
Uh, so what if this doesn't work?

18:48.377 --> 18:52.063
I have a plan B, the Nature Spa 3000.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.924
It's a sound machine. All right?

18:54.926 --> 18:56.568
I realize that when I was in the Amazon,

18:56.570 --> 18:57.902
I could be lulled to sleep

18:57.904 --> 19:01.430
by the beautiful sweet
sounds of nature...

19:05.102 --> 19:06.986
And that's supposed to
drown out my snoring?

19:06.988 --> 19:08.821
Can't hear you, honey.

19:08.823 --> 19:11.416
Right there we got the
beautiful, sweet sound

19:11.418 --> 19:14.994
of the howler monkey
and the bulldog bat.

19:18.666 --> 19:21.280
You know what? I am so touched

19:21.282 --> 19:22.913
that you went to all
this trouble for me.

19:22.915 --> 19:25.046
I mean, honey, you sure it
wouldn't be easier for you

19:25.048 --> 19:26.248
to just sleep in Mandy's room?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.767
Then I wouldn't be
able to sleep with you.

19:29.769 --> 19:33.438
Mmm. Oh, you better watch
out, I'm coming down!

19:41.448 --> 19:44.616
Guys, I can't really
sleep with all this noise.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.452
Can't hear you.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.953
Rude.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.292
- Oh, those darn howler monkeys.
- Mmm.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.635
Hey there, Mike Baxter for Outdoor Man.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.996
Talking today about gravitational pull,

20:06.998 --> 20:10.716
the diabolical force of physics
that keeps us earthbound,

20:10.718 --> 20:12.552
skins our kids' knees,

20:12.554 --> 20:16.648
and makes plastic
surgeons very, very rich.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.317
Yeah, gravity is
constantly pulling at us,

20:19.319 --> 20:22.228
relentlessly as a
telemarketer, until eventually

20:22.230 --> 20:25.139
it swallows us right into the ground.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.233
Happy thought, huh?

20:27.235 --> 20:30.185
Of course, the Earth itself
would fly off into space

20:30.187 --> 20:32.330
if it weren't for the
pull of the Sun's gravity.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.648
It was my close friend Copernicus

20:34.650 --> 20:37.026
who reached the blasphemous conclusion

20:37.028 --> 20:39.003
that the Sun was the
center of the universe.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.838
Can you imagine that, huh?

20:40.840 --> 20:44.342
But he escaped the punishment of
the church in a very clever way.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.845
Right after publishing
his ideas, he croaked.

20:50.833 --> 20:55.353
Nobody tell Hemingway, but
the Sun doesn't actually rise.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.263
It just sits there with its arms folded

20:57.265 --> 20:59.932
while the puny little
Earth runs laps around it

20:59.934 --> 21:03.177
like an overcaffeinated Chihuahua.

21:03.179 --> 21:06.030
I'm not a flat-earther or a geocentrist,

21:06.032 --> 21:09.683
but the Sun is not the
center of my universe.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.560
My lovely wife Vanessa is.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.705
She's my rock, and
her gravitational pull

21:13.707 --> 21:16.541
actually allows me to soar.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.151
The harmonious way we
orbit around each other

21:19.153 --> 21:20.953
is like the... the music of spheres,

21:20.955 --> 21:22.788
which, of course, I've never heard

21:22.790 --> 21:26.092
because my rock snores
like a congested wild hog.

21:29.372 --> 21:33.082
And that is why we are
selling sound machines,

21:33.084 --> 21:35.893
on sale this week at Outdoor Man.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.228
Baxter out.
