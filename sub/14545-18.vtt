WEBVTT

00:01.087 --> 00:02.804
Ahh.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.204
Throat looks good.

00:05.721 --> 00:07.406
Pupils are dilating normally.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.983
Do you want to sit up?

00:08.998 --> 00:10.292
Any fever?

00:10.326 --> 00:11.960
- She's cool to the touch.
- No.

00:11.994 --> 00:14.596
Although I couldn't get her to
submit to a core reading.

00:14.886 --> 00:15.566
Uh, appetite?

00:15.597 --> 00:18.049
Diminished.
Greatly diminished.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.794
How's the mood?
Good?

00:19.992 --> 00:21.376
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

00:21.410 --> 00:23.591
She's moody,
but then she always has been.

00:23.698 --> 00:26.299
Regular bowel movements,
from what I can hear,

00:26.947 --> 00:29.073
but a mother's instinct,
Dr. Roger.

00:29.265 --> 00:31.316
Something's different.
She's off.

00:31.359 --> 00:33.477
Mrs. shay,
may I ask you to step

00:33.495 --> 00:35.315
into the waiting room
for a moment?

00:35.708 --> 00:36.791
Why didn't you tell me?

00:36.826 --> 00:38.747
Because it's none
of your business.

00:39.655 --> 00:42.957
Being in love is nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:43.703 --> 00:45.004
Unless he's a drifter.

00:45.038 --> 00:46.555
Are you in love with a drifter?

00:47.268 --> 00:47.886
No.

00:47.903 --> 00:50.371
It's not Arthur Fonzarelli,
is it? Because he's fictional.

00:50.921 --> 00:53.740
Look, Lisa, I get it.

00:53.774 --> 00:55.241
You're a <i>tweenager,</i>

00:55.292 --> 00:57.428
and tweenagers don't like
talking to their parents.

00:57.456 --> 00:58.938
I'm not a tweenager.

00:58.948 --> 01:00.832
I'm practically old enough
to vote.

01:02.637 --> 01:04.578
Now you listen to me,
Lisa Marie.

01:04.601 --> 01:07.043
For years, I have sat here
while you prattled on

01:07.075 --> 01:08.742
about your social life,
when nothing

01:08.760 --> 01:10.866
even remotely interesting
was going on!

01:10.927 --> 01:13.099
Well, now that things
are getting real,

01:13.126 --> 01:14.610
I want details.

01:14.716 --> 01:16.158
I want the dish.

01:16.366 --> 01:17.908
Bring it on, sistah.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.897
She broke your bed?

01:20.407 --> 01:23.325
Buddy, Jill was doing things
to me last night

01:23.343 --> 01:25.586
that would have broken
a K.G.B. Agent.

01:25.793 --> 01:28.211
She's got me open, buddy,
wide open.

01:28.283 --> 01:32.652
My theory is that
she had been so repressed,

01:32.659 --> 01:34.737
so frigid
for so many years that

01:34.771 --> 01:37.540
her sexual energy pent up
inside of her like a Tsunami,

01:37.558 --> 01:41.811
and once I figured out how
to unleash her waves,

01:41.845 --> 01:45.475
they have been crashing down
on me every night, buddy!

01:45.514 --> 01:48.717
Every night I have been
surf in' my lady's brine.

01:48.735 --> 01:50.019
Okay, I'm just gonna take
this to go.

01:50.037 --> 01:51.555
Oh, hell, I'll eat it.

01:51.556 --> 01:54.634
Thank <i>you.</i> I'm ravenous
from all the intercourse.

01:55.041 --> 01:57.248
I can't get enough sustenance

01:57.498 --> 01:59.540
to fuel the intercourse.

01:59.805 --> 02:00.978
Mm.  Dallas!

02:00.994 --> 02:03.726
Oh! George, you startled me.
I was mid-tweet.

02:03.866 --> 02:07.409
"#mid-tweet"... and send.
I'm all yours.

02:07.464 --> 02:09.416
Well, I-I haven't seen you
around recently.

02:09.417 --> 02:10.687
- Everything good?
<i>- So,</i> so good!

02:10.689 --> 02:13.006
If you read my last tweet, then you
wouldn't have to ask.

02:13.564 --> 02:15.298
Well, I'd rather ask.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.761
When I don't see you,
I worry about you, Dallas.

02:17.901 --> 02:19.352
I mean, I think about you,

02:19.386 --> 02:21.321
and I know this must be
kind of a rough time.

02:21.847 --> 02:22.776
Rough time?

02:22.925 --> 02:25.017
You know, with the divorce.

02:25.662 --> 02:26.995
I heard it was finalized.

02:27.030 --> 02:28.547
Why, yes, it was.

02:28.598 --> 02:31.030
I got the papers this morning,
and I had 'em laminated.

02:31.108 --> 02:33.085
My divorce is so final,
you could eat off it,

02:33.136 --> 02:34.649
which I did,
and it tasted good.

02:34.712 --> 02:35.971
Glad to hear you're eating well

02:35.989 --> 02:36.938
and keeping yourself...

02:36.956 --> 02:38.657
<i>Real,</i> real busy.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.042
I've been filling
every second of every day

02:40.076 --> 02:43.195
with lots of <i>real</i> fun,
super fun, real fun stuff.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.163
Okay.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.480
And then, come midnight,

02:45.498 --> 02:48.133
I stone-cold medicate myself,
and I sleep like a rock.

02:48.582 --> 02:50.185
Oh. Well, okay.

02:50.219 --> 02:51.920
It sounds like you have
a system, I guess,

02:51.955 --> 02:53.138
but, you know,
things do have a way

02:53.173 --> 02:54.520
of catching up with you.

02:54.614 --> 02:57.896
I know, which is why I have dalia
in therapy five days a week.

02:58.029 --> 02:58.944
Well, gotta run.

02:58.995 --> 03:00.729
I have a pap smear,
and then I'm taking Yakult

03:00.763 --> 03:03.344
to get blinged-out grillz
like Nelly.

03:31.499 --> 03:32.280

I think you two should maintain
your individual identities

04:49.114 --> 04:50.965
and not feel compelled to fuse
into one person

04:50.999 --> 04:52.333

I actually get that a lot.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.051
You're jiving me. Really?

06:14.079 --> 06:15.600
Mom.

06:17.450 --> 06:20.530
Tessa. She wants to know
what's up for the weekend.

06:20.572 --> 06:21.868
- Well, tell her you're hanging out with me.
- I'm afraid that

06:21.906 --> 06:23.840
if I do that, she'll spend
the whole weekend hiding out

06:23.868 --> 06:25.756
in the handicapped stall
of the girls' room.

06:25.876 --> 06:27.139
- Mm.
- We need to find someone

06:27.176 --> 06:28.143
to hook Tessa up with,

06:28.162 --> 06:29.646
so she doesn't feel like
a third wheel.

06:29.683 --> 06:31.618
Would you like
to sleep over tonight?

06:32.078 --> 06:34.078
I-I don't think
my mom would allow that.

06:34.198 --> 06:35.758
Of course not.

06:36.102 --> 06:37.745
I just don't want him
to lose interest.

06:39.088 --> 06:39.849
I won't.

06:40.572 --> 06:41.971
What about Evan?

06:42.534 --> 06:44.290
We already know that he likes Tessa,

06:44.328 --> 06:47.154
and he won't have any conflicting plans
because he's friendless.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.204
It's a win-win.

06:48.232 --> 06:50.476
Okay, you lovebirds.
Time for school.

06:50.596 --> 06:52.401

06:55.408 --> 06:59.014
You two have a great day.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.530
Ham and cheese, brother.
If you keep dating Lisa,

07:03.650 --> 07:05.194
plenty more
where that came from.

07:07.701 --> 07:09.833
Why is she coming
bed shopping with us?

07:10.556 --> 07:12.302
Why am I coming
bed shopping with you?

07:12.330 --> 07:13.964
Because I want your opinion.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.340
Well, I want Dallas to think
we want her opinion.

07:16.460 --> 07:17.551
I'm worried about her.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.983
She seemed a little manic
the last time I talked to her.

07:20.103 --> 07:20.819
Hi, y'all!
Oh.

07:20.837 --> 07:22.377
Hey.
Hey.

07:22.497 --> 07:24.133
Ohh.
I hope I'm dressed okay.

07:24.253 --> 07:25.607
Since I didn't know what
we were doing,

07:25.644 --> 07:27.447
I brought a raincoat,
a walking coat, a car coat,

07:27.475 --> 07:29.297
and a cape,
in case we see opera.

07:29.417 --> 07:30.489
We probably won't see opera.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.339
Yeah, probably no opera.

07:32.701 --> 07:34.062
We're going shopping for a bed.

07:34.091 --> 07:35.189
Oh! Super fun.

07:36.598 --> 07:38.138
Hey, can your car find us...

07:38.586 --> 07:40.654
A European mattress store?

07:40.889 --> 07:42.316
Prius!

07:42.436 --> 07:43.990
Mattress store!

07:45.718 --> 07:47.286
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, what about that place

07:47.324 --> 07:48.235
on post road?

07:48.244 --> 07:49.098
Let's do it.

07:50.451 --> 07:51.061
Evan.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.469
Look, if you're here
to pants me,

07:52.507 --> 07:53.793
don't waste your time.
I'm wearing a belt

07:53.818 --> 07:55.330
made of staples
that go into my skin.

07:55.348 --> 07:56.700
I'm not here to pants you.

07:56.975 --> 07:58.205
I'm here to talk to you
about Tessa.

07:58.215 --> 07:59.970
What about Tessa?
Look, I know you like her,

07:59.999 --> 08:01.642
and I want to help you
so that she likes you back.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.726
Are you the great Houdini?

08:03.933 --> 08:05.088
Because if not, Malik,

08:05.107 --> 08:06.079
I seriously doubt
that she would...

08:06.107 --> 08:08.003
Look, Evan, I'm black,

08:08.257 --> 08:09.769
and black people know a lot
about romance.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.205
Is that true?

08:11.325 --> 08:12.968
Al green, Al B. Sure!

08:16.562 --> 08:18.048
Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin gaye?

08:18.085 --> 08:19.156
Yeah, but wasn't he...
No.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.292
Evan, he wasn't.

08:20.902 --> 08:23.949
Okay. Maybe black people
<i>are smoove.</i>

08:24.690 --> 08:27.545
So what do I have
to do to make Tessa like me?

08:27.573 --> 08:30.155
A lot of things, Evan,
and none of those things include

08:30.174 --> 08:32.399
wearing a belt made of staples
that go into your skin.

08:34.942 --> 08:39.082
It's like she expects people
to feel sorry for her,

08:39.402 --> 08:41.251
but, like, I don't feel
sorry for her.

08:41.914 --> 08:43.707
What <i>do</i> you feel?

08:43.717 --> 08:47.652
Angerment.
Bitterness. Resent.

08:47.934 --> 08:50.723
You blame <i>her</i> for the divorce.

08:51.004 --> 08:52.065
I do.

08:53.028 --> 08:54.615
I totally do.

08:56.052 --> 08:58.812
You know, until you put
those words into my mouth,

08:59.291 --> 09:00.793
I didn't even realize
I felt them.

09:00.913 --> 09:04.221
Dalia, I think it's important
that you confront her

09:04.254 --> 09:05.803
with these feelings.

09:07.942 --> 09:09.099
Now if it's okay with you,

09:09.475 --> 09:10.761
I'd like to bring her in.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.280
You have a lot of nerve
showing your face here!

09:21.400 --> 09:22.538
Yakult!

09:22.923 --> 09:26.104
This session is not about you.
It's about dalia.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.649
Now you sit...

09:28.842 --> 09:30.081
And you listen.

09:33.558 --> 09:36.826
I don't want
to see no panties tonight.

09:36.946 --> 09:37.896
- What?
- -What?

09:43.499 --> 09:45.837
Take off
that brassiere, my dear.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.551
Evan, did you just tell me
to take off my brassiere?

09:48.589 --> 09:49.678
What? N-no!

09:50.328 --> 09:52.356
Wait. Did you want me
to tell you to do that?

09:52.476 --> 09:55.032
Wait!
But, girl, I be tryin' to get witchu!

09:55.152 --> 09:57.831
Evan, gross.
You just spit in my ear.

10:01.781 --> 10:04.748
Really, you guys? You're trying
to unload me on Evan?

10:04.868 --> 10:07.246
Tessa, we just didn't want you
to feel like a third wheel.

10:07.274 --> 10:07.969
I didn't!

10:08.089 --> 10:09.894
Uh, no, but the other day
at the yogurt shop...

10:09.935 --> 10:11.146
You were being gross.

10:11.184 --> 10:13.409
And we're gonna continue
to be gross, really gross.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.522
We just don't want this
to affect our friendship.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.536
<i>This</i> affects
our friendship, okay?

10:18.656 --> 10:21.005
If I wanted a man,
I could have one.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.668
I could have more than one.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.377
Hey, I'm open to that,
you little freak.

10:24.497 --> 10:28.255
I don't need you trying
to pawn me off on some perv.

10:31.278 --> 10:32.902
That's the furthest

10:32.940 --> 10:34.931
I ever went with a girl,
you guys.

10:38.743 --> 10:40.142
Oh, yeah!

10:40.262 --> 10:41.231
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

10:41.351 --> 10:43.346
That seems... good.

10:43.365 --> 10:45.572
It's also comfortable
for sleeping.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.346
Yeah, I'm not gonna
be doing a whole lot

10:47.375 --> 10:49.750
of sleeping on this baby.
Am I right?

10:49.760 --> 10:51.853
It's the Rolls-Royce
of mattresses, sir.

10:51.878 --> 10:54.150
Uh, the... it's the last one
we have in stock.

10:54.270 --> 10:56.216
Hand-tailored
Icelandic eiderdown,

10:56.235 --> 10:58.000
cashmere-encased coils,

10:58.019 --> 10:59.850
hypoallergenic
horsehair batting.

10:59.887 --> 11:01.540
The boning, of course,
is unbleached pine.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.329
"The boning."

11:03.004 --> 11:04.432
I like the sound of that.

11:04.450 --> 11:06.244
You seem very comfortable
in it, sir,

11:06.469 --> 11:07.774
a-and I can assure you,

11:07.802 --> 11:09.801
there is not
a finer mattress to be had.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.145
I'll take it.
Excellent.

11:11.265 --> 11:13.239
All right.
 All right.

11:13.276 --> 11:13.839
Ohh.

11:15.097 --> 11:17.266
I know what you're thinking,
and I totally agree.

11:17.304 --> 11:18.694
- It is obscene...
-  To spend

11:18.712 --> 11:20.562
that amount of money
on a mattress.

11:20.853 --> 11:22.797
"The honeymoon never has to end

11:22.837 --> 11:25.099
with the eternal honeymoon
sleep system."

11:25.219 --> 11:27.597
Dallas, are you okay?

11:29.081 --> 11:30.780
Maybe Steven and I just had

11:30.808 --> 11:32.010
the wrong mattress.

11:32.130 --> 11:35.864
Oh, honey.
No. It wasn't that.

11:36.305 --> 11:37.723
Ohh.

11:38.277 --> 11:40.080
Ohh.

11:40.352 --> 11:42.286
Hi. Should I put down
a waterproof pad?

11:42.328 --> 11:44.300
Because I am just about
to run your friend's card.

11:44.318 --> 11:45.680
I really don't think
that's necessary.

11:47.389 --> 11:49.079
Okay. You know what?
Get the pad.

11:57.409 --> 11:59.719
<i>End of a long school week,</i>
<i>and you know what?</i>

11:59.839 --> 12:02.658
<i>I was glad to have the night</i>
<i>to myself.</i>

12:02.778 --> 12:05.818
<i>I was no third wheel.</i>
<i>I was a unicycle.</i>

12:05.856 --> 12:08.382
<i>You</i> are a unicycle.

12:09.330 --> 12:10.992
You're a unicycle.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.767
<i>I'd start with a light dinner,</i>

12:13.801 --> 12:15.960
<i>watch a thought-provoking</i>
<i>documentary...</i>

12:15.979 --> 12:17.162
Move...

12:17.282 --> 12:18.439
That...

12:18.559 --> 12:19.895
Bus!

12:20.015 --> 12:21.369
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

12:24.829 --> 12:27.242
<i>Reconnect</i>
<i>with some old friends...</i>

12:28.425 --> 12:29.674
Cool and cute.

12:32.743 --> 12:36.076
<i>And help myself</i>
<i>to a little bedtime snack.</i>

12:38.630 --> 12:39.625
Ryan?

12:41.369 --> 12:43.106
What are you doing
out there, watching me?

12:43.885 --> 12:44.618
Yes.

12:46.468 --> 12:47.209
Why?

12:47.329 --> 12:48.336
Tessa, look at you.

12:48.806 --> 12:50.355
You fell off.

12:50.653 --> 12:52.944
You're wearing pajamas
that are covered in food.

12:53.826 --> 12:55.545
These are fresh out
of the wash.

12:55.665 --> 12:56.690
Look at all that butter.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.286
Who would eat that much butter?

12:59.623 --> 13:00.759
I can't...

13:01.923 --> 13:03.520
Answer that question.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.614
When I overheard my sister
and Malik talking about

13:05.734 --> 13:07.848
trying to fix you up
with someone, I thought,

13:07.876 --> 13:09.886
Tessa Altman made out
with Ryan shay.

13:10.364 --> 13:11.444
She could have anyone,

13:11.650 --> 13:13.707
but after watching you
from the bushes tonight,

13:13.827 --> 13:14.843
I'm not so sure.

13:17.115 --> 13:17.998
Ryan, wait.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.622
I'm just...

13:19.979 --> 13:21.359
Not myself right now,

13:22.187 --> 13:24.684
and, yes, maybe I am
leaning on butter

13:24.722 --> 13:26.666
a little more
than I normally would,

13:26.684 --> 13:28.224
but...

13:28.515 --> 13:30.177
I'm a recovering tricycle,

13:30.297 --> 13:32.168
trying to get by on one wheel.

13:33.190 --> 13:33.932
Been there.

13:34.937 --> 13:36.646
So you wanna get something
to eat?

13:37.322 --> 13:39.040
Your pajamas are making me
hungry.

13:41.115 --> 13:42.674
So we close soon.

13:43.143 --> 13:45.819
George, get her off my bed.
She's funkin' it up.

13:45.939 --> 13:47.519
What do you want me to do?
Fix it!

13:47.639 --> 13:48.965
You're the one who brought her with us.

13:50.326 --> 13:51.068
Uh...

13:51.406 --> 13:52.449
Oh, look. It's dalia.

13:52.569 --> 13:54.343
Dallas, it's
your daughter dalia.

13:54.463 --> 13:55.489
No?

13:55.609 --> 13:56.184
Hello?

13:56.446 --> 13:57.470
Hey, dalia.

13:57.590 --> 14:00.221
Okay. Okay. You're... you're
ready to be picked up?

14:00.493 --> 14:01.639
Okay, great.
We're just running

14:01.648 --> 14:03.442
a few minutes late,
so sit tight.

14:04.814 --> 14:07.320
Dallas, dalia's ready
to be picked up.

14:07.321 --> 14:08.100
Are you gonna go get her?

14:08.128 --> 14:09.856
I have a dinner engagement.
Okay.

14:09.976 --> 14:11.105
Noah, take my car keys.

14:11.123 --> 14:12.372
Go pick up dalia
from her shrink.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.100
Kill some time
before you bring her home.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.162
I will figure out a way to get
Dallas out of this bed.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.148
That's a promise, okay?

14:17.176 --> 14:19.157
If Jill smells sorrow
on this mattress...

14:19.176 --> 14:20.603
We have a no-return policy.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.500
Then you're buying it off
of me.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.786
Lock up when you leave.
If anything goes missing,

14:27.824 --> 14:29.045
it's going
on your friend's card.

14:29.073 --> 14:30.763
Uh, okay. Thank you
for your understanding.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.298
Hey, okay, big sale today,
though, right?

14:34.214 --> 14:35.134
<i>Right.</i>

14:38.937 --> 14:41.031
Why didn't mommy come
get me herself?

14:41.867 --> 14:42.946
Mommy...

14:43.829 --> 14:46.036
Mommy is having a hard time
right now.

14:46.063 --> 14:47.987
She's going through
some things.

14:48.107 --> 14:50.973
Oh, please.
What's her problem?

14:51.809 --> 14:53.358
She didn't want to live
with daddy any more,

14:53.377 --> 14:54.260
but I did.

14:54.541 --> 14:56.063
I guess that's true, isn't it?

14:58.307 --> 15:01.096
Here, yakult. You can have
half of my spring roll.

15:02.279 --> 15:04.326
Oh, my God. Did you see that, Uncle Noah?

15:04.446 --> 15:05.326
She almost bit me!

15:05.364 --> 15:08.537
She almost bit me because I said
something bad about mommy.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.129
The two of them are
total cohorts, if that's a word.

15:11.166 --> 15:12.922
Oh, and now look.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.631
She's eating
the whole spring roll,

15:14.657 --> 15:15.915
when I only said
she could have half.

15:16.807 --> 15:18.028
Here. You can have mine.

15:23.559 --> 15:25.549
This is why I wanted my own pet.

15:25.669 --> 15:27.234
This is why I asked mommy
to please get me

15:27.272 --> 15:28.294
"the hangover" monkey,

15:28.295 --> 15:30.032
like from
that movie "the hangover."

15:30.830 --> 15:32.605
I mean, she has yakult
on her side,

15:32.643 --> 15:34.239
and I have no one.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.257
I'm all alone.

15:40.290 --> 15:43.380
Hey, have you seen
that movie "kangaroo Jack"?

15:43.858 --> 15:46.628
No. Is it good?

15:47.355 --> 15:49.026
I laid around a lot.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.942
I watched a lot
of "people's court,"

15:51.289 --> 15:53.599
a court in which justice
was almost never served,

15:54.932 --> 15:56.622
but then I realized,

15:56.976 --> 15:58.150
when you're a single parent,

15:58.178 --> 16:01.239
being depressed is a luxury
you just can't afford.

16:01.277 --> 16:02.779
You have to get up
and take care of your kid,

16:03.483 --> 16:05.014
'cause no one else
is gonna do it for you.

16:06.619 --> 16:08.056
I have Carmen.

16:10.215 --> 16:12.947
Yes, you have Carmen
to cook and to clean

16:13.067 --> 16:15.510
and to drive dalia
the places she needs to go,

16:15.717 --> 16:17.980
but Carmen can't inspire dalia.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.337
She can't teach her
what it means

16:20.375 --> 16:22.056
to get up when you feel down.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.549
Carmen isn't dalia's mother.

16:27.643 --> 16:28.600
You are,

16:29.433 --> 16:31.461
and that right there is
reason enough to climb off

16:31.827 --> 16:35.593
this outrageously
comfortable mattress,

16:35.612 --> 16:37.874
this mattress that
is clearly from heaven.

16:46.269 --> 16:48.795
George, am I okay?

16:49.518 --> 16:50.945
Of course you're okay.

16:52.711 --> 16:53.884
I've never been...

16:53.913 --> 16:55.340
Depressed.

16:56.175 --> 16:57.509
It's standard issue.

16:57.629 --> 16:59.049
Comes free with the divorce.

17:00.426 --> 17:03.112
I don't even know what
a depressed person dresses like.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.012
Separates?

17:06.867 --> 17:09.412
I'm probably gonna need
a whole new depression wardrobe.

17:11.811 --> 17:13.801
I'll probably need
a whole new wardrobe.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.599
♪ yeah ♪

17:24.252 --> 17:25.511
♪ Yeah ♪

17:27.230 --> 17:28.347
♪ Yeah ♪

17:30.097 --> 17:32.576
♪ And I just can't get enough ♪

17:32.970 --> 17:34.097
Damn, girl.

17:34.557 --> 17:36.304
Where did you learn how
to eat fondue?

17:36.424 --> 17:37.177
♪ Yeah ♪

17:43.162 --> 17:45.538
Uh, let's just go
somewhere else.

17:45.575 --> 17:46.458
Why? I thought you sid

17:46.486 --> 17:48.017
you wanted a bowl
of wet, hot cheese.

17:48.137 --> 17:49.087
I don't remember saying I w...

17:49.125 --> 17:50.618
Okay, it was me.
I want a bowl

17:50.655 --> 17:52.129
of wet, hot cheese,
and this place has it.

17:52.370 --> 17:54.717
Plus wait till you see
how long their forks are.

17:55.553 --> 17:56.417
Okay.
Yeah!

17:56.537 --> 17:58.680
Well, let's just get in there
before they see us.

18:06.149 --> 18:07.520
Are you sure you're okay
with this?

18:07.640 --> 18:08.675
'Cause I know
they don't serve any

18:08.795 --> 18:10.299
of the food that was listed
on your pajamas.

18:10.337 --> 18:11.473
Yeah.  Yeah.

18:11.497 --> 18:14.925
I don't only eat... food
that's on my pajamas.

18:15.331 --> 18:18.430
Okay. Whew.
'Cause I feel like

18:18.550 --> 18:20.270
I may have oversold
the forks a little.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.885
No, they're big.

18:22.005 --> 18:23.256
Yeah.
 Aah.

18:24.927 --> 18:26.326
Oh, my God, Malik.
Aah!

18:26.527 --> 18:27.495
Ow! Damn, girl!

18:27.504 --> 18:30.039
Where did you learn how to feed someone fondue?
Do you see this?

18:30.159 --> 18:31.970
My heart is breaking.
Tessa's bottomed out.

18:31.998 --> 18:33.792
I'm bleeding.
You stabbed me in the gums.

18:33.811 --> 18:35.257
Tessa, wait. Don't run.

18:35.285 --> 18:37.078
I'm not running.
I'm seated.

18:37.114 --> 18:39.387
I can't even imagine
how lost you must feel

18:39.612 --> 18:41.283
to resort to Ryan. I...

18:41.546 --> 18:44.851
Lisa, I'm fine.
You <i>have</i> to stop pitying me.

18:45.049 --> 18:47.546
For a minute there,
you had me pitying myself.

18:47.761 --> 18:50.315
It's true.
I caught her eating butter.

18:52.287 --> 18:53.733
Now that I think about it,
it's kinda messed up

18:53.770 --> 18:54.878
that I brought you out
for cheese.

18:54.897 --> 18:56.850
You're gonna have
wicked gas tonight.

18:57.558 --> 18:58.656
Probably.

18:59.079 --> 19:01.228
Listen, Lisa, you don't
have to feel guilty

19:01.229 --> 19:02.637
about doing things without me.

19:02.757 --> 19:06.262
I'm a big girl, okay,
so go finish your fondue,

19:06.290 --> 19:07.351
and we'll talk tomorrow.

19:08.699 --> 19:09.910
Okay. Well, you heard that.

19:10.030 --> 19:11.722
She's fine,
so you can head on home.

19:12.173 --> 19:13.206
Actually...

19:13.947 --> 19:16.182
We're kinda having a nice time.

19:16.408 --> 19:17.243
Really?
Really?

19:20.374 --> 19:21.407
Yeah.

19:25.350 --> 19:27.594
I didn't even own
one pair of shoes

19:27.714 --> 19:29.844
when I walked barefoot
into this country.

19:29.964 --> 19:31.431
- Ew.
- Within a year,

19:31.675 --> 19:33.318
I taught myself
to speak English...

19:33.337 --> 19:34.783
Carmen, honey, put a pin in it.

19:34.903 --> 19:37.093
Dalia's mama's here
to inspire her.

19:37.213 --> 19:38.239
To speak English by listening

19:38.254 --> 19:39.738
to NPR 's
"all things considered."

19:41.578 --> 19:45.616
Dalia, I know
you're mad at me.

19:45.635 --> 19:47.945
I'm mad at me, too,
and I'm mad at Steven,

19:47.982 --> 19:49.146
and I'm mad at Carmen.

19:49.185 --> 19:51.157
- You're mad at me?
- It isn't always rational.

19:52.922 --> 19:53.934
Now I know it's hard for you

19:53.935 --> 19:55.542
to understand the choices
I've made,

19:55.561 --> 19:58.640
but I'm trying to show you
that if you're unhappy in life,

19:58.657 --> 20:00.516
it's your responsibility
to fix it.

20:01.219 --> 20:03.435
No one else is gonna
fix it for you.

20:03.555 --> 20:05.716
I know, and that's why
I made Uncle Noah buy me

20:05.726 --> 20:06.824
a "kangaroo Jack."

20:11.125 --> 20:15.989
Dalia! I'm pretty sure
I was clear about no movie pets.

20:17.162 --> 20:20.176
That said,
he is a cute Carmel color.

20:20.296 --> 20:22.007
That I was not expecting.

20:22.127 --> 20:24.191
And he makes me
really happy, mommy.

20:24.311 --> 20:27.224
He does, and I can keep
my cell phone in his pocket.

20:27.243 --> 20:29.599
Then, Carmen, we have
a new member of the family.

20:30.078 --> 20:31.506
Thank you so much, mommy.

20:31.626 --> 20:33.881
He is way cooler
than "the hangover" monkey.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.402
Aah!

20:37.984 --> 20:40.266
So... this was fun.

20:40.585 --> 20:42.914
Thank you for getting me
out of the house tonight.

20:43.864 --> 20:46.352
My mom says when you want
to thank someone,

20:46.362 --> 20:48.737
you should send
a thank-you card,

20:49.254 --> 20:51.075
but... I don't want
a thank-you card.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.593
I want you to let me touch
your boob instead.

20:54.713 --> 20:55.823
My boob?

20:56.922 --> 20:57.758
Either boob,

20:58.255 --> 21:00.143
just so I can say
I did, mostly.

21:02.713 --> 21:04.121
You have three seconds.

21:04.591 --> 21:05.896
Go for it.
