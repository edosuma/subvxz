WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.537
Kaniel Outis.
He's been working with ISIL.

00:03.570 --> 00:04.738
You know that's not Michael.

00:04.772 --> 00:05.973
We're gonna need you.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.741
I can rest when I'm dead.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.210
That's what I'm worried about.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.912
I'm not leaving Michael.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.382
We can't risk all of it
for just one man.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.250
ISIL has broken through
the checkpoint.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.685
Sana'a is falling.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.388
We work together or we both die.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.156
You have my word.

00:22.190 --> 00:25.593
It's Abu Ramal
that Poseidon wants free.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.829
(shouts)

00:28.862 --> 00:30.264
KELLERMAN:
Poseidon sent you?

00:34.768 --> 00:36.170
Enough!

00:36.204 --> 00:37.338
(shouts)

00:37.371 --> 00:38.772
(man groaning)

00:38.806 --> 00:40.674
Who the hell is this guy?

00:40.708 --> 00:43.344
He's my brother.
Back at the prison...

00:43.377 --> 00:47.381
I had to deny who you were.
They were filming me,

00:47.415 --> 00:48.749
and they can't know.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.950
SID:
Abu Ramal has been martyred.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.252
The entire army of ISIL

00:51.285 --> 00:53.954
just declared war on us.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.730
Behold the villain.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.244
(phone rings)

01:16.277 --> 01:17.878
Hi.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.282
Hey. I, uh, I ran into town
to get some coffee.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.317
Do you want anything?
No. I'm good.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.885
Thanks, honey.
I'm almost done here.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.054
I will see you at the lake
in a little while, okay?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.423
Okay. I'll see you
back at the house.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.991
The hubby?

01:31.024 --> 01:32.793
Uh, what did you learn
from Kellerman?

01:32.826 --> 01:36.397
There's no easy way
to deliver this news, darling.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.432
It's a heartbreaker.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.674
Doesn't get any better.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.908
He's rotten all the way
to the core.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.909
You've been sleeping
with the enemy, baby.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.611
I don't understand.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.080
I followed them two monkeys
from Kellerman's house

01:53.113 --> 01:54.582
right after they put
a bullet in him.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.784
Needless to say
he wasn't our guy.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.152
(laughs)

01:58.186 --> 01:59.487
He did say some
pretty alarming things

01:59.520 --> 02:01.922
about your boy, Poseidon,
the world shaker.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.024
Um...
Didn't give me enough
to put all the pieces together.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.194
Back up, back up, back up.
What did they say?

02:06.227 --> 02:07.961
Jacob? His words?

02:07.995 --> 02:10.097
I couldn't get close enough
to hear much, but what I did...

02:10.130 --> 02:12.266
what I did hear was
your name and Michael's.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.535
Yes, they seemed pretty cozy,
the three of them.
Oh, my God.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.270
It's a nasty bag of conspir...
Where are you going?!

02:16.304 --> 02:17.571
To my son!

02:20.674 --> 02:24.044
WHIP:
Stay down. Stay down.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.314
It's another
artillery strike.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.853
LINCOLN: But they sure
as hell are used to it.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.931
Go, go!

02:49.503 --> 02:51.171
(crowd chanting in Arabic)

03:05.586 --> 03:07.588
(speaking Arabic)

03:13.361 --> 03:15.929
(crowd shouting)

03:15.963 --> 03:17.965
(crowd chanting in Arabic)

03:23.904 --> 03:27.775
CROWD:
Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.

03:27.808 --> 03:28.876
Allahu Akbar.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.456
(crowd shouts)

04:00.073 --> 04:01.742
SID: ISIL just offered
ten million for our heads!

04:01.775 --> 04:04.412
Wait. Wait. Stay here.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.613
We got to get off these streets

04:05.646 --> 04:06.647
or we're dead.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.383
Ten million rial?

04:09.417 --> 04:10.718
You give up your mother

04:10.751 --> 04:11.885
for cash like that.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.253
It's about what I paid

04:13.287 --> 04:15.222
for Freddie Mercury's ashes.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.458
Freddie Mercury now, really?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.560
It's better than talking
about 500,000 people

04:19.593 --> 04:21.228
looking to kill us.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.463
Come on.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.565
Found a place
to figure out next steps.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.800
Let's go.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.180
This is the part
you tell me what's going on,

04:40.213 --> 04:41.582
the whole thing.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.150
No. Th-There's no time.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.485
Country's about to fall.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.486
You'll get your
answers, I promise.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.754
Right now our window is closing.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.988
We need to...

04:48.021 --> 04:50.157
We need to pivot
to the next contingency.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.992
Train station.
Get up to the north.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.093
Exit the country that way.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.528
Things have changed
in the four years

04:54.562 --> 04:56.430
you've been locked up
in Ogygia, Michael.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.098
Your plan's redundant.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.468
ISIL control the north, roads,
checkpoints, train stations.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.637
Even if we make it across
the city, it's suicide.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.473
No. You're wrong.
It's a shell game.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.307
You go where
they never expect you.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.676
Wait. You came all the way
to Yemen looking for him.

05:08.709 --> 05:09.710
You think he was
lost or something?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.211
Come on.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.481
You want to live?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.983
The airport's
the only option.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.851
The airport's known as the main
artery to the outside world.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.553
It's the first thing
ISIL will shut down.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.623
Planes were flying an hour ago.
You got a phone?

05:22.656 --> 05:25.526
No, but he does.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.060
Burned it up
getting off to Queen, though.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.397
Guilty as charged.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.032
C-Note's organizing a passage
on the flight as we speak.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.801
MICHAEL:
No, I'm telling you,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.202
my plan will work.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.336
Once... once you leave

05:36.370 --> 05:37.871
the northern part
of Sana'a...

05:37.905 --> 05:40.508
Enough. We shouldn't even
be talking about this.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.742
MICHAEL:
Get off me!

05:42.610 --> 05:43.811
How are you alive?!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.546
In Yemen?!

05:45.579 --> 05:47.848
What happened to you, Michael?!

05:50.718 --> 05:54.154
Now, I'm not moving
another inch until you tell me

05:54.187 --> 05:56.457
what the hell's
really going on here.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.028
*

06:33.794 --> 06:36.129
Michael Scofield had to die.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.767
I had to fake my death.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.102
Go away.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.337
It was part of the deal I made.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.109
If I went to work
for a deep-cover operative

06:49.142 --> 06:50.243
named Poseidon...

06:53.346 --> 06:55.348
...we would all go free.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.357
We were free.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.228
We were exonerated.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.163
No.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.467
That's what we thought...

07:13.501 --> 07:16.504
but we were wrong.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.773
A few weeks
before I married Sara...

07:19.807 --> 07:21.742
I was approached by Poseidon.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.177
You think I'm showing?

07:24.211 --> 07:26.146
I'm not used to that yet.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.316
I got to...
I got to tell Michael.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.019
Here you go. Burgers
will be just a second.
Hello?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.823
Yes, this is Michael.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.299
Poseidon told me
Kellerman didn't have

07:46.333 --> 07:49.136
the authority or jurisdiction
to exonerate our crimes.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.372
He used that as a legal fulcrum.

07:52.405 --> 07:55.108
Told me he could put us
all away for life

07:55.142 --> 07:57.878
within the mandate
of the law unless...

08:00.848 --> 08:02.349
...unless I went
to work for him.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.686
What the hell
can they be talking about

08:05.719 --> 08:06.920
at a time like this?

08:07.988 --> 08:11.024
I don't know.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.628
But big brother's hearing things
I want to hear.

08:14.662 --> 08:15.796
SID:
We cannot stay.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.798
We must go now.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.100
Maybe we don't.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.036
What the hell
are you talking about?

08:24.071 --> 08:25.172
Maybe all this running

08:25.205 --> 08:27.440
is just delaying the inevitable.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.579
Die alone here.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.547
Die alone at home.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.719
God, you need a girlfriend, man.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.589
(men shouting)

08:41.621 --> 08:46.493
Those voices are heading our
way. They're almost on us.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.761
Who the hell
is this Poseidon guy?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.930
A psychopath.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.767
A frustrated policy wonk
in the CIA

08:53.801 --> 08:57.237
who felt he could do better
than his superiors.

08:57.270 --> 09:01.208
So he created a cell
within the CIA called 21-Void,

09:01.241 --> 09:03.911
implementing his own
intelligence operations.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.514
And he needed my help

09:07.547 --> 09:10.851
breaking out people
imprisoned all over the world.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.452
Terrorists,

09:12.485 --> 09:14.121
political dissidents...

09:15.488 --> 09:17.490
...rogue agents...

09:19.727 --> 09:23.130
and if I did it, you and Sara,
you'd go free.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.898
Your record's expunged,

09:24.932 --> 09:29.502
but... there was a rub.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.474
I wasn't allowed to have
contact with any of you,

09:34.507 --> 09:36.977
including my son.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.879
Michael.

09:38.912 --> 09:43.516
So, Michael Scofield
was dead and...

09:45.653 --> 09:47.921
...over the years
I assumed many names.

09:47.955 --> 09:51.792
Kaniel Outis... the most recent.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.494
Why didn't you tell me?

09:54.527 --> 09:56.129
Why didn't you reach out to me?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.131
I didn't have a choice.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.935
Poseidon made that...
very clear.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.672
How?

10:04.705 --> 10:08.075
At first, I said no.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.077
I wouldn't do it.

10:10.110 --> 10:14.782
Then within weeks,
Sara was incarcerated, beaten.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.718
And so I gave in.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.421
Everything I did,
I did for family,

10:21.454 --> 10:23.456
for you, for Sara,

10:23.490 --> 10:25.759
for Mike.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.761
So none of you would ever have
to spend another day

10:27.795 --> 10:30.497
inside a prison cell or...

10:30.530 --> 10:32.532
or live a life on the run.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.836
Look at us now.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.471
(crash above)

10:38.505 --> 10:39.940
They're starting to
search the buildings.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.009
Train station.
Airport.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.044
Train station.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.216
(people clamoring)

10:52.720 --> 10:56.523
GATE ATTENDANT: All passengers
must present a ticket.

10:56.556 --> 11:00.794
All passengers must
present a ticket.
(man grunts)

11:00.828 --> 11:03.196
Never gonna get to our seats.
We need to go through there.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.132
Even the pilot
can't get on the plane.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.900
C-NOTE: This is an airport
full of planes.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.069
There's got to be others.
It's no good.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.337
People will die here today.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.571
We need another option.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.140
My man, Omar.
Omar?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.507
That slippery brother?

11:14.541 --> 11:16.343
Trust is a luxury
right now.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.146
He can be trusted. To a point.
He has connections on

11:19.179 --> 11:20.981
the western coast,
across the desert.
No.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.516
Lincoln and Michael are
coming here. That's the plan.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.719
They don't have a
next move if we leave.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.354
Now they're out there somewhere,
God knows where.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.422
Your friends are too late.
Look around you.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.891
This airport
is no good to them.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.760
We're not leaving.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.798
(gunfire in distance)

11:39.066 --> 11:40.433
What is that place?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.837
Where the
westerners went

11:43.871 --> 11:45.072
when they made
their escape.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.040
I ran into one
at the Forger's Den.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.541
I can help.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.944
And how do you expect
to find the foreigners

11:50.978 --> 11:52.245
with only one eye?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.652
(car engine starts)

12:03.991 --> 12:05.225
They're here.
ISIL are here!

12:05.258 --> 12:06.659
(crowd clamoring)

12:11.264 --> 12:13.566
C-NOTE: Come on, come on.
I have an idea.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.636
The pilot.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.638
Okay, follow me.
Follow me!

12:18.671 --> 12:20.473
Don't lose him.
Don't lose the pilot.

12:28.015 --> 12:31.151
C-NOTE: Come on.
Come on, come on.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.454
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.456
No, just stay down.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.834
Okay. Wait here.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.101
What?
I'll be back.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.436
Benjamin...
I'm going alone.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.804
Don't do it.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.377
(engine revving)

12:59.146 --> 13:00.380
(tires screech)
ISIL SOLDIER:
Halt!

13:10.290 --> 13:11.624
What are you doing here?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.526
On your knees!
Halt!

13:13.560 --> 13:15.428
Come out.
Come out.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.864
Who are you?
Papers.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.966
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Papers.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.100
SHEBA:
Infidels!

13:20.133 --> 13:22.669
The infidels
are in the airport.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.005
The killers of Ramal!
I've seen them with my own eyes.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.474
What?
I want my reward.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.977
The ten million rial.
I will be rich.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.711
ISIL SOLDIER:
Take us to them.
Not until you promise

13:31.744 --> 13:36.016
I will get my
ten million rial.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.385
If you speak the truth,
you'll have the money.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.888
(grunting)

13:45.825 --> 13:47.060
(ISIL solider choking)

13:59.072 --> 14:01.341
You kick a lot of ass
for a good Muslim.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.412
You can take the man
out of the streets,

14:05.445 --> 14:07.047
but you can't take
the streets of the man.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.149
PILOT: Why do you help me?
Who are you?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.151
I'm a man,
just like you,

14:11.184 --> 14:13.053
trying to get out
of this madness,

14:13.086 --> 14:16.489
but we're not gonna get
out through those gates.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.724
The only way out now

14:17.757 --> 14:19.759
is up, brother.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.428
The 747 is done.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.695
It's been secured
by the rebels.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.998
I'm not talking
about Yemenia Air.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.233
I have my eyes

14:26.266 --> 14:27.734
on a different
set of wings.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.182
(door opens)

14:42.215 --> 14:44.217
Mom?
Hey.
JACOB'S FATHER: Sara!

14:44.251 --> 14:45.452
You scared us.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.954
Sorry.
Is everything all right?

14:46.987 --> 14:49.389
Yeah, no, It's fine.
I just... It's been a crazy day,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.091
made more so by the fact that
I forgot Mike's Spanish lesson.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.792
MIKE: Spanish?
SARA: Yeah.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.694
That's not today.
We're gonna talk about
it in the car, okay?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.229
Are you sure?
Is everything okay?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.198
SARA: Really. Yes.
We're fine. Thank you.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.100
Well, let me
get Mike's bag.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.302
No, no, don't worry about it.
I'll get it tomorrow.
(car door opens)

15:08.075 --> 15:09.876
I want you to get in the car
and no matter what...
Hey.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.313
you don't get out, okay?
Hey, hey, hey!
Where you going so fast?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.882
Get in.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.750
Thank you.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.488
How was that department
meeting yesterday?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.458
You usually
meet with killers?

15:27.860 --> 15:29.963
Sara. Sara.
Please, please, please.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.698
I can explain, okay?
Just listen to me.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.136
I was sick with worry.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.905
I needed to protect you,
to-to protect our family,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.773
so I picked up
your phone from the shop

15:40.807 --> 15:42.242
and I took it
to Andrew Nelson,

15:42.275 --> 15:44.244
my buddy in the computer
sciences department.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.745
He did a deep dive,

15:45.778 --> 15:48.348
some kind of data archaeology,
and he did it.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.616
He tracked
those bastards down.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.584
Got their
cell information.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.486
So... so I called them,

15:53.520 --> 15:54.854
thinking I could-I could maybe

15:54.887 --> 15:56.489
make a-make a deal with them.
You called them.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.659
Sara?

15:59.692 --> 16:00.927
Sara, please, listen to me.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.030
Sara, this was for you.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.332
You're gonna want to get out
of the way right now.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.300
Sara. Sara!

16:16.076 --> 16:17.877
MICHAEL:
This is it.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.613
Our ticket out of
the country.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.483
LINCOLN: I'm telling you,
Michael, this is a bad idea.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.985
ISIL are everywhere.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.622
MICHAEL:
No, I can do this.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.224
You really paid the equivalent
of ten million rial

16:31.258 --> 16:32.792
for some dude's ashes?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.727
Not just any ashes, man.

16:34.761 --> 16:38.498
Freddie Mercury's ashes.

16:38.531 --> 16:42.069
I would've paid
twice that.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.470
MICHAEL:
Come on.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.173
Keep your head down.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.315
I think it's time we get sane
and head to the airport.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.683
No, no, no.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.219
This is better.
They control the station.

16:59.252 --> 17:03.356
They'll never think
to look for us here now.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.224
They're repurposing
those trains for cargo,

17:05.258 --> 17:06.492
not passengers.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.894
Once we're on, it's...

17:07.926 --> 17:09.762
it's a straight shot
to the north.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.499
They won't check
the cars again.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.901
That's what you see
when you see the train?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.569
I see a bunch of dudes
with AK-47s

17:16.603 --> 17:18.771
who don't look a thing like us.
Do you really believe

17:18.805 --> 17:21.208
we can survive
300 miles on a train

17:21.241 --> 17:22.675
through ISIL territory?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.243
Now, that's suicide.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.746
It does seem risky.
No kidding.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.885
No, no.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.088
We get in that line of cargo
carriers. Keep our heads down.

17:35.122 --> 17:38.691
Once we're on the train,
lay low the rest of the trip.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.928
Besides, we don't need
to look like them.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.897
Tell the believing men
to lower their gaze

17:44.931 --> 17:46.433
and be modest.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.301
Come on.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.469
From the Koran.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.146
CYCLOPS:
All the roads are blocked.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.954
So you'll have to find
a different way to the border.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.759
(gasps)

18:13.826 --> 18:14.994
By train!

18:17.197 --> 18:20.066
Heather, what now?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.568
What now?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.102
I mean, it was all a lie.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.437
Wasn't it? Everything.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.005
Our whole life,
our whole marriage.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.741
He was standing as close
as you were to me right now,

18:28.775 --> 18:31.178
and he was chatting
with the woman who shot him.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.680
You're saying he planned
to get himself shot

18:33.713 --> 18:36.249
like it was some sort of,
uh, sick performance?

18:36.283 --> 18:38.251
I don't know. I don't know.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.919
I mean, I...

18:39.952 --> 18:42.955
Yes. Yes, it was.
But he almost died.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.991
So, the plan was
to wing him, right?

18:45.024 --> 18:47.294
To just put him above suspicion,
but the shot went wide.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.362
He gets hit.

18:49.396 --> 18:53.466
He knows that he's
married to a doctor.
Sara, Sara, stop. Stop.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.034
You haven't slept in
three days, right?

18:55.067 --> 18:58.104
You're upset about
the home invasion

18:58.137 --> 19:00.440
and you're tying
yourself up in knots

19:00.473 --> 19:03.310
because the love
of your life,

19:03.343 --> 19:06.846
the father of your baby,
might be alive.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.885
(voice breaking): And I can't
get through to Lincoln.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.954
But I saw that video.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.189
It's him.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.226
Okay, and I...
That's Michael.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.127
And I believe you. I do.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.495
And that matters.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.030
That's all that matters.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.398
No, I know.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.166
But Jacob is a good man.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.168
He's your husband.
(phone ringing)

19:29.202 --> 19:31.971
Yeah.
And he helped you
start a new life.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.373
Together.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.543
And that's him.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.248
I have to answer it.
No. No.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.384
No, you don't.
HEATHER (on machine): Leave a
message and we'll get back.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.985
(answering machine beeps)

19:46.018 --> 19:48.087
JACOB: Heather, Heather?
Is Sara there?

19:48.120 --> 19:49.556
Please, I-I need
to speak with her.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.190
Look, there's been
a huge misunderstanding

19:51.224 --> 19:52.425
and I can explain everything.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.660
Will you just...
will you tell her that?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.894
And to call me?

19:54.927 --> 19:56.195
He's tracking me.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.265
Oh, Sara, honey.
I'm your best friend.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.233
Of-of course he's gonna
call here first.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.634
It doesn't make
him Deep Throat.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.704
Listen,

20:04.737 --> 20:06.439
let's just see if there's
a simpler explanation.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.007
Hmm?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.109
Okay.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.546
What was the name of that
computer tech that he mentioned?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.415
Uh... Andrew.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.183
Nelson. Andrew Nelson.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.452
Okay, well, I have an old friend
in that department.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.087
We can find out

20:21.120 --> 20:22.555
if Jacob's full of it
in one call.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.156
Okay.

20:25.958 --> 20:30.229
(indistinct conversations)

20:34.501 --> 20:36.903
(man speaking Arabic)

20:43.109 --> 20:44.977
(Sid speaks Arabic)

20:50.517 --> 20:52.619
(grunting, men shouting)

20:52.652 --> 20:54.854
(woman yelling)

21:11.504 --> 21:14.374
(shouting in Arabic)

21:17.009 --> 21:19.178
(train horn blaring)

21:19.211 --> 21:21.481
Get on the other side
of that train!

21:32.992 --> 21:34.126
WHIP: Come on,
come on, come on,

21:34.160 --> 21:35.928
come on,
come on!

21:35.962 --> 21:38.665
(train horn blaring)

21:41.534 --> 21:43.135
MICHAEL:
Come on, let's go.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.841
(camera shutter clicks)

21:52.479 --> 21:56.015
(phone rings)

21:57.249 --> 21:58.485
What do you want?

21:58.518 --> 22:00.387
Look at the picture
I just sent you.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.822
I can see the murderers now.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.459
Where?

22:06.493 --> 22:08.227
Not so fast.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.262
Bring your weapons,
I will stay on them.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.734
And I call the shots now.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.707
PILOT:
We checked. There's enough fuel
to get us out of Yemen.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.514
(speaks Arabic)

22:27.547 --> 22:29.682
C-NOTE: Question is, can you fly
an old bird like this?

22:29.716 --> 22:30.917
PILOT:
We'll find out.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.889
(men yelling in Arabic)

22:39.892 --> 22:40.927
MICHAEL:
There's another station,

22:40.960 --> 22:43.262
30 miles
outside Sana'a.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.664
We can find a way there,
hop a train.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.767
They won't anticipate us
coming that way.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.536
Doubling down
on a bad bet.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.270
Just like you did

22:51.303 --> 22:53.239
seven years back
with the CIA.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.174
Look around you.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.176
Your plans affect people,
you don't even see it.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.179
I don't blame you
for resenting me.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.247
You're damn right
I resent you.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.684
I see it, Linc.
I see it.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.453
Every second
of every day,

23:06.486 --> 23:08.287
the people,
the collateral damage,

23:08.320 --> 23:10.723
the lives I've...
affected.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.358
(engine turning over)

23:12.391 --> 23:13.593
But I can't start thinking
about that.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.194
Because if I do,

23:15.227 --> 23:16.362
then it all falls apart

23:16.395 --> 23:18.297
and none of us
get to go home.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.966
I have to stay focused,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.901
be the man with the plan.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.302
Just like Fox River.

23:23.335 --> 23:25.905
(engine revving)
Remember?

23:27.940 --> 23:29.308
(whistles)
We got wheels.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.309
MICHAEL:
Good work.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.244
The airport's the only play.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.415
The airport
is five miles away.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.850
The border is hundreds.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.887
Look,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.622
the airport might be
the right choice,

23:42.655 --> 23:45.458
but I trust
my instincts.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.093
They've gotten us
this far.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.595
And my gut says

23:48.628 --> 23:50.630
we can still make it out through
the north. Choice is yours.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.267
WHIP:
Look, man,

23:55.301 --> 23:56.603
I agree with you, even if
I don't know you from Adam.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.804
But...

23:57.837 --> 24:00.507
got to go
with the horse

24:00.540 --> 24:03.075
that got you here,
you know? So...

24:03.109 --> 24:04.511
he's my horse.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.283
Craziest horse I've ever met.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.252
But got us this far.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.353
Crazy only works

24:14.386 --> 24:15.655
if it doesn't get you killed.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.373
(door opens)
HEATHER: Andrew?

24:34.406 --> 24:36.776
Uh, Professor Hayden told us
to speak with you?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.511
ANDREW: Oh, yeah.
Uh, yeah, right.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.546
Sorry.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.313
Uh, hi, Andrew.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.282
I'm Sara Scofield.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.517
Thanks for taking
the time.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.352
By any chance,

24:46.385 --> 24:49.188
did my husband Jacob Ness ask
you to work on my cell phone?

24:49.221 --> 24:52.358
Yeah, he did, uh, yesterday.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.826
What did he, uh...

24:53.860 --> 24:55.628
what did he ask
you to do?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.396
Uh, he said he was looking to
find the contact information

24:57.429 --> 25:00.533
for the people who were
stalking his wife.

25:00.567 --> 25:03.502
So I did a data dive
and gave him what I could find.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.504
How?

25:05.538 --> 25:08.908
They hacked your phone
and lifted the data,

25:08.941 --> 25:12.144
but in the process, left a
very slight electronic signature

25:12.178 --> 25:14.246
that I was able to
track back to them.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.548
Wait, who are "they"?

25:15.582 --> 25:18.217
Don't know.
It was a dummy IP address,

25:18.250 --> 25:20.553
but the cell
and location were correct.

25:20.587 --> 25:21.854
They couldn't hide that
from me.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.423
(phone rings)

25:25.858 --> 25:28.360
(sighs, scoffs)

25:28.394 --> 25:31.564
The man himself.

25:31.598 --> 25:34.033
(phone continues ringing)

25:34.066 --> 25:36.035
(phone beeps)

25:36.068 --> 25:37.436
Hello.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.672
Sara, listen,
I know you're upset,

25:39.706 --> 25:42.274
but I need you to come to the
Whitney Heights police station

25:42.308 --> 25:43.542
right now.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.077
Please.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.222
So, now we got
some time to talk.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.090
Um...

25:59.125 --> 26:01.093
Well, your name's Michael.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.862
Cool.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.563
You have a brother.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.966
What else
don't I know?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.972
Serious, I need to know.
I've been traveling so fast,

26:13.005 --> 26:14.774
for so long, I didn't even stop
to think who you really are

26:14.807 --> 26:16.308
or what we're real
doing here.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.543
I don't even know why

26:17.576 --> 26:19.245
you dragged me
into all this, you know?

26:19.278 --> 26:22.448
You got to forget the past,
Whip, the details.

26:22.481 --> 26:23.816
None of that matters now.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.985
What have my actions been
all these years?

26:26.018 --> 26:27.586
Who's been taking care of you

26:27.620 --> 26:29.622
through everything, huh?

26:29.656 --> 26:31.057
Me. Right?

26:31.090 --> 26:33.559
Right?

26:33.592 --> 26:34.794
Yeah.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.163
Nothing changes.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.597
You're still my whip hand...

26:38.631 --> 26:40.299
Whip hand, yeah, I know,
I'm your whip hand.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.369
It's-it's not good enough
this time, man.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.405
Can you just give it
to me straight?

26:46.438 --> 26:47.807
You know, I'm a big boy,
I can handle it.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.742
There's a reason
you're my whip hand.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.779
A reason that's gonna
change your life.

26:52.812 --> 26:53.980
There's a light at the end
of the tunnel for you.

26:57.684 --> 26:58.785
(all grunting, gasping)

27:00.519 --> 27:01.988
LINCOLN:
What the hell was that?

27:07.059 --> 27:08.194
WHIP:
Oh, son of a bitch.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.428
LINCOLN:
We got to go.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.529
Let's go!

27:24.677 --> 27:27.146
(speaking Arabic)

27:28.514 --> 27:29.749
(shouting in Arabic)

27:35.654 --> 27:37.223
There's no way out.
WHIP:
Back of the hospital's

27:37.256 --> 27:38.991
been shelled to rubble.
It's blocked.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.827
Upstairs is
blocked, too.

27:40.860 --> 27:41.994
We're gonna go
downstairs.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.696
Look for a way out.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.164
You do the same.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.239
Thanks.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.110
What's going on?

27:59.879 --> 28:01.613
Sara, just...

28:02.949 --> 28:04.383
just come with us.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.185
You'll see. Please.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.693
Hello, ma'am.
Um, Sara Scofield?

28:14.727 --> 28:16.062
Yes, sir.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.365
Thanks for coming in,
I'm Detective Keenan.

28:19.398 --> 28:22.101
We'd like you to point out
who broke into your home.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.335
And...

28:23.369 --> 28:25.704
the one who shot
your husband.

28:29.308 --> 28:30.576
It's three and four.

28:30.609 --> 28:31.944
The man and the woman
was the shooter.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.746
Are you sure?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.090
Yes, sir.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.657
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.863
There's got to be a way out.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.899
Something... something that
connects to the surface.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.601
Going down's not
gonna work, Michael.

28:55.634 --> 28:56.969
We need to set up
an ambush and fight.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.070
Yeah, well,

28:58.104 --> 28:59.405
fighting is your
default setting.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.908
It's not always about fists.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.143
JA: I'm telling you,
there's no way out.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.578
Then find something
to fight with, you idiot.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.093
I don't think it's
that kind of a party,

29:21.127 --> 29:22.628
but I like your style.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.596
What are you going to do
with that?

29:24.630 --> 29:27.099
I don't know.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.534
Beats a fist.

29:30.302 --> 29:35.107
* We are the champions *

29:35.141 --> 29:36.976
* My friends *

29:38.777 --> 29:39.979
* And we'll keep on
fighting... *

29:40.012 --> 29:41.447
WHIP:
Rubbing alcohol?

29:41.480 --> 29:42.681
What the hell
are you doing?

29:42.714 --> 29:44.851
* Till the end *

29:44.884 --> 29:47.586
You'll go blind,
you idiot.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.755
JA:
It's only 95% alcohol.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.658
I'll only go 95% blind.

29:52.691 --> 29:54.193
* ...the champions *

29:54.226 --> 29:57.796
* No time for losers *

29:57.830 --> 29:59.198
* 'Cause we... *

30:00.967 --> 30:03.635
There.
There's an air shaft.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.706
(grunts)

30:07.739 --> 30:09.308
(grunting continues)

30:09.341 --> 30:12.644
(men shouting above)

30:19.185 --> 30:20.853
(shouting in Arabic)

30:21.921 --> 30:25.557
Well, it's about fists now.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.936
* We are the champions... *

30:42.841 --> 30:43.842
(door opens)

30:43.876 --> 30:45.077
Michael?

30:48.347 --> 30:51.783
No. It's them.

31:16.408 --> 31:19.345
My first lover
was much older than me.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.780
He was my
friend's father.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.816
Massi was his name.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.519
(chuckles softly)

31:27.553 --> 31:30.756
It was the greatest of scandals

31:30.789 --> 31:32.424
that we kept to ourselves.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.928
But his wife
discovered us

31:35.962 --> 31:37.997
and told her brothers.

31:42.068 --> 31:45.804
Massi was taken
into the desert...

31:45.837 --> 31:49.775
and buried.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.910
Alive.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.582
They brought his eyes
to me in a rag.

32:01.853 --> 32:05.124
I need you to use that on me.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.960
End my suffering.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.297
What, this?

32:11.330 --> 32:14.133
SID:
Ja's right. All this
running is pointless.

32:14.166 --> 32:17.469
Do you know what they
will do to me here,

32:17.503 --> 32:19.871
away from seeing eyes?

32:21.974 --> 32:25.077
I can't...

32:25.111 --> 32:26.812
I won't let that happen.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.480
Do you understand?

32:28.514 --> 32:31.017
I won't let that happen.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.819
Listen. Sid.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.821
I'm not giving up.

32:35.854 --> 32:38.657
And queer or no,
you're not, either.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.029
They're in the wrong.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.530
Not you.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.706
WHIP:
What are you gonna do with that?

32:54.740 --> 32:58.877
* I've paid my dues *

32:58.910 --> 33:02.514
* Time after time *

33:02.548 --> 33:05.317
* I've served my sentence *

33:05.351 --> 33:07.886
* But committed no crime... *

33:07.919 --> 33:09.321
(Michael grunts, bangs)

33:15.494 --> 33:17.763
LINCOLN:
Michael, come on.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.202
I'm sorry, Linc.

33:23.235 --> 33:24.636
(sniffles)

33:24.670 --> 33:27.739
I should have come to you.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.309
I should've asked for your help

33:30.342 --> 33:34.913
when Poseidon offered me
the deal. I blew it.

33:34.946 --> 33:36.982
At the time,
I thought

33:37.015 --> 33:40.919
if I dealt with it myself,
the pain would only be mine.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.722
But instead I opened
this Pandora's Box.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.692
I wanted to make it better,

33:46.725 --> 33:48.394
but I only made it worse

33:48.427 --> 33:51.263
for everyone.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.066
And somewhere in there...

33:56.435 --> 33:58.837
...I became a ghost.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.872
*

34:21.226 --> 34:23.061
I made a lot of mistakes.

34:23.094 --> 34:26.931
A lot of foolish,
imperfect choices,

34:26.965 --> 34:29.601
but every one of them...

34:32.338 --> 34:35.541
...every one of them
I made for love.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.143
I know. I know.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.447
Michael,

34:42.481 --> 34:46.118
you're the smartest person
I've ever known,

34:46.152 --> 34:48.587
but you can't carry the load
on your shoulders alone.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.791
You need to share
the burden.

34:52.824 --> 34:53.992
Yes.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.494
That's family.

34:55.527 --> 34:59.265
That's what family's for.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.400
Sara, I don't know
what you thought, but...

35:01.433 --> 35:03.669
I'm just a husband
who was worried about his wife.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.938
And yeah, I-I should have told
you what I was doing, but...

35:06.972 --> 35:09.074
Look, I felt like... like
everything was spiraling

35:09.107 --> 35:11.610
out of control and I had to do
whatever I could to protect you.

35:11.643 --> 35:15.013
So you thought
you'd contact two hired killers?

35:15.046 --> 35:17.483
I was trying to play
the white knight.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.986
(chuckles)
Not very well.

35:21.019 --> 35:22.521
And it was insanity.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.156
I was scared to death.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.024
A-A blubbering idiot,

35:26.057 --> 35:29.595
but I thought they would respond
to money, you know?

35:29.628 --> 35:32.264
Pay them whatever it took
to make them go away.

35:32.298 --> 35:35.334
More than they were
already making:

35:35.367 --> 35:37.536
$50,000.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.038
Look, I, uh...

35:40.071 --> 35:43.642
I had a tracker in it, Sara.

35:43.675 --> 35:47.813
This little thing, but
they didn't touch it.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.047
(chuckles softly)

35:49.080 --> 35:53.151
I contacted the police
before the meet,

35:53.185 --> 35:55.787
but we nailed
them anyhow.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.689
We nailed them.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.491
Jacob.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.660
I am so sorry
I put you through this.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.044
Let's do this.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.551
A wrench and a pipe against AKs.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.687
It'll be fun.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.057
I've always wanted
a crack at these bastards.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.278
(speaking in Arabic)

36:52.311 --> 36:56.782
JA (echoing):
* I paid my dues *

36:56.815 --> 36:59.017
(muttering)

36:59.050 --> 37:00.886
* Time after time *

37:02.454 --> 37:04.790
* I've served my sentence *

37:04.823 --> 37:05.791
(whispering):
Come back.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.727
* But committed no crime *

37:08.760 --> 37:11.129
* And bad mistakes *

37:11.162 --> 37:12.364
WHIP:
Get over here...

37:12.398 --> 37:14.733
* I've made a few *

37:14.766 --> 37:16.067
You're gonna get
yourself killed!

37:16.101 --> 37:18.904
* I've had my share *

37:18.937 --> 37:21.273
* Of sand kicked in my face *

37:21.307 --> 37:23.642
* But I've come through *

37:23.675 --> 37:27.313
* And I go on and on and on *

37:27.346 --> 37:28.614
(footsteps approaching)

37:28.647 --> 37:31.417
* We are the champions *

37:31.450 --> 37:33.685
(guns clicking)
* My friends *

37:35.253 --> 37:37.088
(shouting in Arabic)

37:39.358 --> 37:40.792
(screaming)

37:43.529 --> 37:46.598
* We are the champions *

37:46.632 --> 37:48.600
* We are *

37:48.634 --> 37:50.802
* The champions... *

37:58.143 --> 37:59.678
(door opens)

38:01.347 --> 38:04.950
WHIP: I love you, you crazy
Japanese son of a bitch!

38:04.983 --> 38:05.984
It's Korean, champ.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.085
Whatever. I still love you.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.286
ISIL are like roaches.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.455
More will be here soon.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.523
What do we do now?

38:11.557 --> 38:13.459
I need to take a break
from making decisions.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.660
Linc, airport?

38:14.693 --> 38:16.462
Airport.

38:16.495 --> 38:19.297
(phone ringing)

38:21.032 --> 38:22.501
Hey.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.670
LINCOLN: I got someone
I want you to talk to.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.807
Hey.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.842
(laughing):
Oh, man!

38:30.876 --> 38:33.379
Now that's a voice
I never thought I'd hear again.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.981
Man, you got some explaining
to do, brother,

38:36.014 --> 38:37.282
risen from the dead and all.
Soon.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.650
Where can we meet you?

38:38.684 --> 38:40.619
Uh, hangar two.
Right off the main runway.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.287
(soldiers shouting)

38:42.320 --> 38:43.389
But you better hurry
your ass up.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.390
Hangar two?

38:44.423 --> 38:45.957
We could be there in 20 minutes.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.225
We can be there in 20 minutes.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.895
I don't know if we have
that long.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.830
Wait for us. We'll be there.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.031
We got to move.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.934
(gunshots)

39:00.772 --> 39:02.641
(Sid grunting)

39:02.674 --> 39:04.075
(groaning)

39:04.109 --> 39:05.511
Sid...

39:05.544 --> 39:07.212
Sid!

39:07.245 --> 39:09.681
CYCLOPS:
I heard your call, infidel.

39:09.715 --> 39:13.351
Wings will not carry you
to safety.

39:13.385 --> 39:16.154
One call, and my brothers

39:16.187 --> 39:18.256
will find your friends
at the airport.

39:18.289 --> 39:19.891
(panting)

39:21.627 --> 39:24.229
(speaking Arabic)

39:32.237 --> 39:33.705
(stabs)
(screams)

39:33.739 --> 39:35.306
LINCOLN: Sid!
MICHAEL: Sid!

39:37.609 --> 39:39.445
LINCOLN:
Son of a bitch.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.051
No, no, no, no, no.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.318
(grunts)

39:50.556 --> 39:52.958
MICHAEL: Talk to me, Sid.
Stay with us.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.325
Stay with us.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.963
Sid...

39:57.996 --> 40:00.398
Sid.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.136
He's gone.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.907
(sniffling)

40:08.940 --> 40:10.308
(laughs)

40:17.315 --> 40:18.917
(Michael grunting)

40:20.185 --> 40:21.520
Don't waste yourself on him.

40:22.588 --> 40:23.955
(moans)

40:23.989 --> 40:24.990
You'll beat him by surviving.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.366
CYCLOPS:
You will die, you hear me?

40:37.636 --> 40:39.437
You will all die!

40:40.806 --> 40:42.140
Oh, my...

40:42.173 --> 40:43.609
PILOT: They're moving
more trucks into position.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.644
Yeah.
We can't wait.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.613
There won't be enough runway
to take off. We must go now.

40:47.646 --> 40:50.348
SHEBA: I owe Lincoln my life.
He deserves better.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.751
But with so many souls
in our hands,

40:52.784 --> 40:54.285
do we really
have a choice?

40:55.521 --> 40:56.722
(exhales)

40:58.957 --> 41:01.326
Listen, we wait
five more minutes.

41:01.359 --> 41:02.928
Okay?

41:02.961 --> 41:05.463
And then we take care
of the souls that we can.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.132
Understand?

41:13.872 --> 41:14.873
What the hell are you doing?

41:17.175 --> 41:18.877
The hell are you doing?

41:21.580 --> 41:24.550
Listen, we are not leaving
my friends!

41:24.583 --> 41:25.784
Shut it down.
Shut it down!

41:25.817 --> 41:27.218
You would condemn us all
to death.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.621
If you stop me, no one gets out.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.757
Your friends can still make it
to safety. We will not.

41:45.837 --> 41:46.838
(gunshots)

41:55.914 --> 41:58.249
(phone ringing)

41:58.283 --> 41:59.718
Yeah?

42:00.919 --> 42:03.555
C-Note? You got to get
out of here, man.

42:03.589 --> 42:06.892
Hey, no, no, no, no. W-We can do
this thing, man. We can do it.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.026
No! Go now!

42:08.059 --> 42:09.327
Otherwise,
you and the kids are dead!

42:09.360 --> 42:11.763
We'll work something out.

42:11.797 --> 42:14.199
We've been through worse.

42:17.703 --> 42:21.072
C-NOTE:
Linc, I'm so sorry.

42:21.106 --> 42:23.541
I'm so sorry, brother.

42:29.615 --> 42:31.683
Lincoln? Find Omar. He...

42:31.717 --> 42:33.118
(static crackles)
What?

42:33.151 --> 42:34.753
I can't hear you. What?

42:34.786 --> 42:36.655
(gunshots)

43:21.266 --> 43:23.268
