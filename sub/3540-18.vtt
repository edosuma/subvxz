00:02.335 --> 00:04.030
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.204 --> 00:07.173
For over a century,
I have lived in secret until now.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.240
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.137
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.302
- Where is he?
- They have him.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.539
Who says we're not here
for revenge, right?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.205
That's what we're here for.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.481
Can you make it?

00:20.153 --> 00:21.643
Take my wrist. You need blood.

00:24.491 --> 00:25.890
Stefan. Stefan, he's dead.

00:28.161 --> 00:31.460
- You were like this other person.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

00:33.266 --> 00:36.235
They found Vicki Donovan.
The storm unearthed the grave.

00:36.403 --> 00:37.995
- She's dead?
- Matt.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.043
Who am I to make you

00:53.219 --> 00:56.211
Could you turn it up a little bit?
It's not annoying yet.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.380
Sorry.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.991
A whole lotta you and...

01:01.294 --> 01:03.125
When you going back to school?

01:03.596 --> 01:07.760
- Soon.
- Oh, come on, just drink already.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.799
Come on.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.437
This self-detox, it's not natural.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.095
Get that away from me, please?

01:14.274 --> 01:18.370
How long did it take to wean yourself
off of it after you last indulged?

01:19.879 --> 01:22.541
- That's not good.
- I'll be fine. It takes a bit of time.

01:22.715 --> 01:26.151
You don't have to kill to survive.
That's what blood banks are for.

01:26.319 --> 01:27.809
I haven't hunted a human in...

01:28.021 --> 01:30.649
- God, way too long.
- Oh, I'm impressed.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.757
It's completely self-serving.

01:34.127 --> 01:37.460
Trying to get the town off the trail
of vampires, which is not easy...

01:37.630 --> 01:40.292
...considering there's an entire tomb
of them around.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.900
What are we doing about that?

01:42.068 --> 01:45.834
We're not gonna be doing much of
anything if you don't have your strength.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.975
There's nothing wrong with a healthy
diet of human blood from a blood bank.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.407
- You're not killing anyone.
- I have my reasons.

01:52.579 --> 01:56.640
What are those holier-than-thou reasons?
We've never actually discussed that.

01:56.816 --> 02:00.980
- You know, I'd love to hear this story.
- You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

02:01.154 --> 02:04.146
Just watching me struggle?

02:04.657 --> 02:07.125
- Very much so.
- I hate to break it to you, Damon...

02:07.293 --> 02:11.525
...but I actually have it
under complete control.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.495
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

02:13.700 --> 02:19.935
Oh. Well, then you should just carry on
making the rest of us vampires look bad.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.468
Have a great day, Stef.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.121
Oh. Hey. Almost forgot something.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.889
Oops.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.653
Mm. Mm.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.295
Come on, Jeremy, I'm going to school.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.207
- Walking out the door now.
- You forgot this.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.206
Thank you.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.403
- Elena.
- Uncle John. Hi.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.578
- Jenna.
- John. You made it.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.979
I said I'd be in by noon.

03:06.152 --> 03:09.644
What you say and what you do
are typically two very different things.

03:09.822 --> 03:12.017
- Uncle John, what's up?
- Hey.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.828
I had some business in town.
I thought a visit was in order.

03:16.996 --> 03:19.863
- How long are you staying?
- I don't know yet.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.558
Okay, well, I'm gonna go school.
I'll see you later.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.000
So, what's up with Jeremy?

03:28.575 --> 03:32.602
He just lost a friend,
so try to be sensitive.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.906
- I'm always sensitive.
- Right.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.174
So really, how long are you staying?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.944
Can't you at least pretend
that you're happy to see me?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.553
Oh, my God, John,
it is so good to see you.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.452
How have you been? No, I can't.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.457
Did you think I was gonna sign the
escrow papers and send them back?

03:49.662 --> 03:52.096
- Actually, I did.
- I'm not gonna let you sell.

03:52.265 --> 03:55.098
It's not up to you or me.
It belongs to Jeremy and Elena.

03:55.268 --> 03:59.568
But they're minors. So I get final say,
being that I'm the estate's trustee.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.968
- He said his trip is open-ended.
- Uncle John. I never really liked that guy.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.806
Does anyone?

04:06.980 --> 04:11.974
- I am here for moral support if you need.
- Thanks. I think I'll suffer this one alone.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.085
You've been through enough.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.089
Thank you, by the way, for just...

04:17.257 --> 04:20.089
For everything you did at Vicki's funeral
and her memorial.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.195
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- Of course, Matt.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.560
So is Caroline still baking for you guys
around the clock?

04:29.736 --> 04:32.796
She finally went to her dad's,
which is a good thing...

04:32.972 --> 04:36.601
...because my mom was gonna strangle
her if she dropped off more lasagna.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.276
Oh. Hm.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.476
I've hit the hard times

04:41.648 --> 04:43.513
I'm off course

04:44.617 --> 04:46.346
The winds have changed

04:47.253 --> 04:48.948
No.

04:49.522 --> 04:52.355
- What's your problem?
- I just don't want any.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.824
All right.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.929
They say she OD'd.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.760
That's what I don't get.
She was doing okay.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.429
Apparently not.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.700
How'd she end up in the woods?
I don't understand.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.935
By whoever was with her
when she OD'd.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.341
You leave her.
You don't take time to bury her.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.108
Maybe she saw something and...

05:20.687 --> 05:21.949
Hell, man, I don't know.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.289
Right this way.

05:32.065 --> 05:36.502
The coroner's office has officially ruled
Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.534
Her family has been notified.

05:38.705 --> 05:42.300
The truth will stay in this room
and we can put this behind us.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.909
Thank you, sheriff.

05:45.311 --> 05:50.374
And on to a more pressing issue.
John Gilbert has asked to say few words.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.519
- Welcome back, John. Good to see you.
- Thank you, mayor.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.711
Hello, everyone.
It's wonderful to see you.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.879
I wish it were
under better circumstances.

05:58.057 --> 06:01.754
As a founding family member, it's my
duty to report some distressing news.

06:01.928 --> 06:02.986
He's a Gilbert?

06:03.162 --> 06:05.653
Elena's uncle. His name is John.
I call him jackass.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.164
A hospital blood bank
in the county of Amherst...

06:08.334 --> 06:10.894
...has reported several break-ins
the past two weeks.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.868
Seven hunters, four campers
and two state employees...

06:14.040 --> 06:15.667
...have been reported missing.

06:15.842 --> 06:18.402
All of this within a 75-mile radius
of Mystic Falls.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.843
Okay, okay, no need to get alarmed
right at this moment.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.505
He doesn't wanna cancel
the Founder's Day party.

06:24.684 --> 06:27.551
You think all of your problems
are over...

06:27.720 --> 06:30.689
...but I'm here to tell you,
nothing's been solved.

06:32.358 --> 06:35.623
I made a copy of a paper
that Jeremy wrote for me.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.095
I think you should take a look at it.

06:43.636 --> 06:44.864
Jeremy wrote this?

06:45.471 --> 06:48.269
He was very clear
that he didn't think it was real.

06:48.441 --> 06:51.239
I really hope you're right,
because I have done so much...

06:51.411 --> 06:53.971
...to protect him from all this.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.278
So how do you deal with it?

07:00.286 --> 07:01.719
What do you mean?

07:01.888 --> 07:03.651
With all the lies and the secrets.

07:04.490 --> 07:07.618
You have to lie to everyone
who's important to you.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.755
It's not safe for them
to know the truth.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.957
So, yes, I keep it from them,
but it's only because I love them.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.568
I think Stefan's a good guy...

07:20.740 --> 07:26.303
...but at the end of the day,
he's still a vampire.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.880
I know it's hard to understand,
but Stefan's different.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.781
He would never do anything
to hurt me.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.022
I have no interest in the Founder's Day
kickoff party.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.422
- Sure you do. It's tradition.
- Far be it to break from tradition.

07:41.594 --> 07:45.030
Gilberts have been a part of this town
for a hundred and fifty years.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.189
One of the founding families.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.699
And with that distinction
come certain obligations...

07:51.204 --> 07:52.796
...including going to the party.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.307
One day, when you can appreciate
the significance...

07:57.477 --> 07:59.604
...l'll tell you all about your heritage.
Hm.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.371
The Gilbert family legacy.

08:01.547 --> 08:02.946
I forgot how sacred it was.

08:03.115 --> 08:06.209
I'm not a Gilbert,
so I was never cool enough to hear it.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.155
- Why does she hate you?
- We used to sleep together.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.848
- Ha!
- I am standing right here.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.553
Why would he write a report
on vampires?

08:18.965 --> 08:22.867
- Do you think he's starting to remember?
- Damon took away those memories.

08:23.035 --> 08:25.128
You don't have to worry about that.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.731
Tell you what,
why don't you just ask him?

08:29.809 --> 08:31.800
- I... I can't.
- Why not?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.572
I mean, if he doesn't know anything,
then it's just a...

08:34.746 --> 08:36.009
An innocent question.

08:37.015 --> 08:40.543
I don't even know
how to talk to him anymore.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.587
I mean, we used to be a lot more open
with each other.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.886
But now,
with all these secrets just piling up...

08:48.461 --> 08:51.658
You know, I haven't even told him
that I'm adopted yet.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.957
Maybe it's time you start
opening up to him again.

08:56.769 --> 09:01.206
I'm not saying you should tell everything,
but try to find out what he does know...

09:01.374 --> 09:03.535
...and be prepared for it.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.074
- What about you? How are you doing?
- I'm much, much better.

09:08.247 --> 09:13.549
You know, I'm still, you know, a little...
A little jittery, a little bit on edge...

09:13.719 --> 09:16.745
...but I'm gonna be okay.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.391
I've been really worried about you.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.286
And I've missed you.

09:21.494 --> 09:25.430
I just needed to lay low for a little while
and let my body readjust.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.363
It's only been a few days.

09:28.534 --> 09:31.230
It feels like a lifetime.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.240
I've missed you too.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.914
Stefan, what's wrong?

10:18.084 --> 10:19.847
Stefan.

10:38.671 --> 10:43.472
- Oh, good. You're here.
- You ask, I come. I'm easy like that.

10:46.078 --> 10:49.809
No, Elena, I will not go
to your bedroom with you.

10:53.953 --> 10:58.447
- Ah. Just like I remembered.
- Stop messing around.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.958
Did you know that your uncle's been
kicking it with the Founder's Council?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.691
- What?
- Yep.

11:08.868 --> 11:13.237
Perfect. We'll just add it to growing list
of how everything is falling apart.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.140
What happened right there?

11:16.542 --> 11:18.237
Nothing.

11:20.546 --> 11:23.845
Look, Damon,
I'm worried about Stefan.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.814
He says everything is okay,
but he's clearly struggling.

11:26.986 --> 11:30.217
- How long before he's back to normal?
- A few days, give or take.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.214
- It's been a few days.
- Give, then. I don't know.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.916
What's the big deal?

11:35.127 --> 11:37.186
He's not himself, Damon.

11:37.363 --> 11:41.663
Well, maybe his problem is he's spent
too long not being himself.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.394
Hm.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.866
Please don't make me sorry
for asking you.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.507
- It is what it is, Elena.
- Hey.

11:49.675 --> 11:53.202
The Stefan you know
was good-behavior Stefan.

11:53.379 --> 11:58.180
Rein-it-in Stefan. Fight-against-his-nature
to-an-annoyingly-obsessive-level Stefan.

11:58.350 --> 12:01.217
If you think there's not another part
to this, then you...

12:01.387 --> 12:03.685
...have not been paying attention.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.258
- He is not you. Not even close.
- Well, he doesn't wanna be me.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.852
But that doesn't mean that deep down
that he's not.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.895
Mm-hm.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.305
- Hey.
- What's up?

12:56.809 --> 12:58.276
Do you have some time to talk?

12:59.278 --> 13:00.438
Uh...

13:01.280 --> 13:03.111
- Yeah, sure.
- Not here.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.307
Come on. Let's get out of the house.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.488
I just can't believe Mom and Dad
never told you that you were adopted.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.319
I'm sure they would've eventually.

13:14.493 --> 13:17.257
Why were you worried
about what I thought?

13:17.429 --> 13:20.523
Because... I don't know, it's weird.

13:20.733 --> 13:25.227
Going your whole life thinking
you're related by blood to someone.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.270
- Does it bug you that we're not?
- No.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.136
Jer, you're my brother.
That's all that matters.

13:33.846 --> 13:37.942
So Mr. Saltzman said you've been
doing great in history now.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.483
Yeah, yeah.
He's really been helping me out.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.814
Yeah, he gave me some extra credit
and stuff.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.456
He loved your vampire paper.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.687
He thought I had a clever angle.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.124
What drew you to that subject matter?

13:51.463 --> 13:54.227
I don't know. Boredom.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.392
Or maybe I'm just as nuts
as the long line of Gilbert crazies.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.698
- The Gilberts aren't crazy.
- Easy for you to say. You're not one.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.269
Ouch.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.325
Oh, God. I shouldn't be here.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.519
Come on. Don't be a downer.
It's a party for founding families.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.257
That would be us.
It would be rude to skip it.

14:27.433 --> 14:30.527
I really liked you a whole lot better
when you hated everybody.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.104
Oh, I still do.
I just love that they love me.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.911
- How you feeling?
- I'm good. I'm fine.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.377
No cravings, no urges?

14:42.748 --> 14:46.047
Is that whiskey you've been
drinking all day doing its job?

14:47.019 --> 14:50.785
We are who we are, Stefan.
Pretending doesn't change that.

14:50.956 --> 14:54.119
Nothing would make you happier
than to see me give in, huh, Damon?

14:54.326 --> 14:55.953
Whatever. It's inevitable.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.354
- I'm gonna go find Elena.
- Don't embarrass me, young man.

15:02.334 --> 15:04.325
Here you go, miss.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.239
I'm so glad you can join us tonight.

15:14.413 --> 15:18.474
- It was nice of you to reach out to us.
- This town is one big family.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.845
When we lose a member,
we all have to come together.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.620
- Matt.
- Mayor.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.485
Kelly.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.296
Well, I guess dead kid rates
a special greeting from the mayor, huh?

15:34.466 --> 15:36.161
God, Mom.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.302
I need a drink.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.337
Hey. Check it out.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.669
Your dad is gonna beat you
if he catches you.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.242
Yeah, let him try.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.380
All right, screw it.

15:57.389 --> 16:00.881
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

16:02.261 --> 16:03.956
Are you drunk?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.996
Okay, I know it's a little weird,
but it's really helping me.

16:10.169 --> 16:13.468
Alcohol, it takes the edge off.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.166
You're totally that drunk high-school guy
at the party sneaking booze.

16:17.343 --> 16:20.039
- I totally am. Yeah.
- How worried do I need to be?

16:20.212 --> 16:25.980
Oh, no. You don't need to be worried.
It's just until the cravings go away.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.609
Listen, I think we should enjoy it
while it lasts.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.791
Would you like to dance with me?

16:33.959 --> 16:36.450
You hate dancing.
I usually have to beg you.

16:36.628 --> 16:40.860
No, you have to beg the sober me. The
drunk me, there's no begging necessary.

16:41.033 --> 16:44.025
- Nice to see you again.
- There's really no one dancing.

16:44.203 --> 16:46.797
That's because they need
something better to dance to.

16:46.972 --> 16:48.564
Be right back.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.734
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.470
I tried to bribe the guy
with 20 bucks and a date.

16:55.647 --> 16:59.640
He said Carol Lockwood has
complete control over the music choices.

17:00.719 --> 17:03.813
You'd be surprised
what Stefan can accomplish...

17:03.989 --> 17:05.547
...when he puts his mind to it.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.652
Thank God.

17:10.396 --> 17:15.163
Counting all different ideas drifting away

17:16.902 --> 17:21.362
Have I entered an alternate universe
where Stefan is fun?

17:22.273 --> 17:24.037
Is he gonna be okay?

17:24.209 --> 17:25.540
- Yeah.
- Eventually.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.474
One way or another.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.113
- Way too complicated

17:30.282 --> 17:33.911
For a minute thought I couldn't tell
How to fall out

17:37.389 --> 17:40.483
I got a problem and it drains my soul

17:40.692 --> 17:43.217
Don't tell, nobody knows

17:43.395 --> 17:44.885
History teacher, 3 o'clock.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.096
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.266
- I've been looking for you.
- Here I am.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.938
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- Yeah, well...

17:56.809 --> 17:59.778
...things have been a little crazy.
But I'm here now.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.139
Do you wanna get a drink?

18:02.214 --> 18:04.307
- Sure.
- Okay. Great.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.146
When did this happen?

18:09.154 --> 18:11.088
DJ had a change of heart.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.053
- You wanna dance?
- I don't know.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.455
- Yes, yes.
- Matt. Matt. Ugh.

18:15.627 --> 18:16.958
Come on.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.392
I got a problem and it drains my soul

18:21.567 --> 18:24.593
I love a woman in uniform,
but I have to side with this look.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.635
You look... You look smashing.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.341
Thank you, Damon. Cheers.

18:32.244 --> 18:34.178
I needed that.

18:35.247 --> 18:38.808
You know,
I had my doubts about you at first.

18:38.984 --> 18:42.750
But like everyone else on the council,
you've won me over.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.113
Thanks, Liz.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.782
It's really nice how welcoming
the council's been.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.156
I like my life here in Mystic Falls.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.696
It's starting to feel like home again.

18:54.566 --> 18:58.764
You're not gonna like what I have to tell.
Jonathan Gilbert's claims check out.

18:58.937 --> 19:02.100
The blood banks, the missing people,
all of it's true.

19:02.274 --> 19:05.300
- We might have a problem.
- Excuse me, sheriff.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.842
Um...

19:07.312 --> 19:10.611
I was curious if there's been any more
information on Vicki Donovan.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.944
It was an overdose, Jeremy.

19:13.118 --> 19:16.315
Yeah, but her body was buried.
Somebody must've done that.

19:16.955 --> 19:20.823
We're aware of that.
The investigation is ongoing.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.190
But there's nothing more
I can tell you at this time.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.593
I'm sorry.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.398
No, it's okay.

19:31.036 --> 19:35.871
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

19:37.176 --> 19:39.906
Please dance with your alcoholic
vampire boyfriend.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.875
- To be found

19:42.047 --> 19:45.141
They all split when I'm in trouble

19:45.317 --> 19:49.378
- Whoa. Watch it.
- I'm sorry. My fault. I'm clumsy.

19:49.555 --> 19:53.491
- Heh, heh. Then get off the dance floor.
- Excuse me.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.219
- That's no way to talk to a lady.
- Whatever.

19:59.565 --> 20:02.227
I think you need to apologize.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.900
I'm sorry.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.569
Now say it like you mean it.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.710
I'm really, really sorry.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.784
- Stefan, it's fine.
- Now walk away.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.783
You all right?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.719
Well, go get your shovel

20:31.897 --> 20:34.388
- Bourbon.
- Thank you.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.662
- You noticed what your brother's up to?
- No. I've been preoccupied with yours.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.296
Jeremy's been asking
about Vicki Donovan's death.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.442
He knows her death
was ruled an overdose.

20:44.610 --> 20:48.478
Really? Oh, but, sheriff, someone
buried her. Who would do that?

20:48.680 --> 20:52.582
I know. I know. Me. I mean, I could
compel him, but he's wearing vervain.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.914
- I don't want you to compel him.
- Lf he keeps asking questions...

20:56.088 --> 20:59.888
Damon, no, I'm serious. I'm not gonna
do that to him again. I'll handle it.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.693
Okay.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.622
Don't say I didn't warn you.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.329
Her prince finally came to save her

21:13.572 --> 21:15.802
And the rest you can figure out

21:15.974 --> 21:17.942
But it was a trick

21:18.110 --> 21:19.771
And the clock struck...

21:19.945 --> 21:21.606
I saw that.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.943
Shh. We'll keep that between you and me.

21:25.517 --> 21:27.075
Where's the ladies' room?

21:27.252 --> 21:30.517
- This way. I'll show you.
- Is that soda?

21:30.856 --> 21:32.016
Um...

21:34.493 --> 21:35.790
Vodka, thank God.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.988
Well, go get your shovel

21:41.166 --> 21:42.497
And we'll dig...

21:42.668 --> 21:43.794
Damon, right?

21:45.237 --> 21:47.603
- John.
- We didn't get to meet at the meeting.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.206
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

21:49.374 --> 21:52.275
- Are you enjoying the kickoff?
- Oh, yeah.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.469
I forgot how much fun these can be.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.877
Yeah, yeah. When is the last time
you were here?

21:58.050 --> 22:01.019
It hasn't been that long.
My brother's funeral.

22:01.186 --> 22:04.155
- How long have you been in town?
- Not long at all.

22:05.524 --> 22:09.153
So what do you think, Damon? You
know this vampire problem is real, right?

22:09.328 --> 22:12.058
- It's a potential bloodbath.
- I wouldn't overreact, John.

22:12.264 --> 22:15.028
Oh, I think it's like 1864
all over again.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.565
Vampires running amuck.

22:17.069 --> 22:21.062
We're gonna have to hunt them down,
throw them in church burn them to ash.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.797
That is the story, huh?

22:22.974 --> 22:24.498
Part of the story, yeah.

22:25.977 --> 22:30.038
- Oh, there's more?
- Oh, there's a lot more.

22:30.215 --> 22:33.150
You see, it seems
there was a tomb under the church...

22:33.652 --> 22:38.351
...where the vampires were hidden away
waiting for someone to set them free.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.048
But then you already knew that,
didn't you?

22:42.794 --> 22:45.092
Being that you're the one that did it.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.767
And you're telling me this, why?

22:49.935 --> 22:51.903
Get the introductions out of the way.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.767
Look, well, you know that I could rip
your throat before anyone would notice.

22:55.941 --> 22:56.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.941
- But you probably ingest vervain, so...
- Why don't you take a bite, find out?

23:02.347 --> 23:03.541
It's not worth my time.

23:36.078 --> 23:37.670
Jer.

23:38.181 --> 23:41.309
L... I heard about your conversation
with Sheriff Forbes.

23:41.484 --> 23:43.748
No one is trying to figure out
what happened.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.649
They're willing to believe she OD'd.

23:45.822 --> 23:48.256
The office confirmed it.
If that's what happened...

23:48.424 --> 23:50.187
Is that what you believe?

23:50.693 --> 23:52.024
What do you think happened?

23:52.195 --> 23:55.096
I think somebody killed her
and buried her body.

23:55.264 --> 23:57.596
I don't think we write it off
because it's easy.

23:57.767 --> 23:59.325
They're doing what they can.

23:59.502 --> 24:01.868
Truth is the only thing
that's gonna help people.

24:02.038 --> 24:06.338
Jer, just let it go, okay?
Whatever it was, she's gone now.

24:07.643 --> 24:09.804
Whatever it was?

24:09.979 --> 24:12.277
So you don't think it was an overdose.

24:12.448 --> 24:14.109
Yes, I do.

24:15.418 --> 24:18.012
Is there something
you're not telling me?

24:18.788 --> 24:22.224
- Why aren't you looking at me?
- Stop it. That didn't mean anything.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.658
If there was something else,
you would tell me, right?

24:27.563 --> 24:28.996
Of course I would.

24:32.034 --> 24:34.502
Oh, God, I can't even walk.

24:34.670 --> 24:37.468
- I know. Me neither.
- Oh, God, Matt's gonna kill me.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.237
He won't even notice.

24:39.442 --> 24:42.468
I think he's actually letting himself
have some fun for once.

24:43.312 --> 24:46.076
I'm supposed to be on my best
behavior because of Vicki...

24:46.249 --> 24:48.342
...but I don't wanna think about it.

24:48.518 --> 24:52.010
I can't, because if I do...

24:54.390 --> 24:55.755
Yeah, I was a dick to her.

24:55.958 --> 24:58.756
I was really bad.

24:59.262 --> 25:04.461
That's what I hate,
is I can't make any of it right.

25:06.002 --> 25:08.971
It's like I don't deserve
to even miss her.

25:12.875 --> 25:14.274
Um...

25:16.779 --> 25:18.178
You're nice to talk to me.

25:19.782 --> 25:21.977
I don't have anyone to talk to.

25:25.388 --> 25:28.289
I don't have anyone to talk to either.

25:32.929 --> 25:34.794
Who knew I'd been missing
all the fun?

25:34.997 --> 25:37.192
This is rare, believe me.

25:37.366 --> 25:40.233
Is it bad that I'm enjoying myself?

25:41.003 --> 25:43.597
No, it's great
that you're enjoying yourself.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.506
- Thanks for making me dance.
- Yeah, no problem.

25:47.076 --> 25:49.135
Waitin' on a cold day

25:49.445 --> 25:53.609
Air. Air. I need some air.
Come with me?

25:55.885 --> 25:57.876
- Sure.
- You haven't seen my mom, have you?

25:58.754 --> 26:00.221
Um...

26:00.389 --> 26:02.414
No, not in a while.

26:02.592 --> 26:04.150
All right.

26:07.129 --> 26:09.063
We're the wild type

26:10.266 --> 26:11.893
Oh, my God.

26:17.406 --> 26:18.930
- What are you doing?
- Matt...

26:19.108 --> 26:21.474
- Mom.
- Whoa, dude, calm down, man.

26:22.244 --> 26:23.404
- Matt!
- No!

26:28.751 --> 26:30.116
Stop it.

26:30.987 --> 26:33.615
Tyler. Stop it, you're hurting him.

26:35.424 --> 26:37.085
Somebody help us.

26:38.794 --> 26:40.489
Stop. Tyler.

26:41.130 --> 26:44.258
Hey, stop. All right, stop.

26:44.433 --> 26:45.559
What the hell was that?

26:46.669 --> 26:47.693
Huh?

26:48.204 --> 26:50.035
Here, come on. Get up. Are you okay?

26:50.206 --> 26:52.003
What was that?

26:52.174 --> 26:54.665
I'll take it from here.
I'll take it from here.

26:55.645 --> 26:57.613
It's all right. It's okay.

26:57.780 --> 27:00.146
You hurt? Okay.

27:00.316 --> 27:01.442
Go get cleaned up.

27:01.617 --> 27:05.314
It's okay. Go get cleaned up.
Thank you for your help.

27:07.089 --> 27:08.681
Everything's fine.

27:09.125 --> 27:12.959
Everything's fine. Back to the party.
Let's go. Come on, have a good time.

27:13.129 --> 27:14.790
- Are you okay?
- Where is she?

27:16.866 --> 27:19.960
I don't know.
Come on, put your head up.

27:28.477 --> 27:31.344
Do you wanna hear the bad news
or the really bad news?

27:32.048 --> 27:34.312
Actually I don't want any news,
Damon.

27:34.483 --> 27:35.814
All right, let me rephrase.

27:35.985 --> 27:39.045
Do you wanna hear how the council's
back in vampire mode...

27:39.221 --> 27:41.246
...or how I just killed
Uncle John Gilbert?

27:41.424 --> 27:44.985
- What?
- Great party, by the way, huh?

27:45.327 --> 27:47.386
[OVER SPEAKERS] Your words so dry
Your face so wet

27:47.563 --> 27:49.190
Damon.

28:10.086 --> 28:12.145
Is everything all right?

28:12.922 --> 28:14.787
No.

28:18.060 --> 28:22.394
I ruined it. I always ruin it.
What is wrong with me?

28:40.249 --> 28:41.614
What are you doing?

28:43.486 --> 28:45.818
Alone, alone, alone

28:46.222 --> 28:48.417
And my heart sinks like a stone
A stone

28:48.591 --> 28:50.456
I'm sorry.

28:51.827 --> 28:54.057
I feel so numb

28:55.498 --> 28:57.227
All right. Well...

29:24.527 --> 29:30.261
No, not a guest to be seen

29:38.240 --> 29:40.367
You've gotta be kidding me.

29:43.546 --> 29:46.481
Thank you all.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

29:46.649 --> 29:48.446
Thank you all for joining us tonight.

29:48.617 --> 29:51.450
In a few moments,
we will officially begin the countdown...

29:51.620 --> 29:53.554
...to our Founder's Day celebration.

29:53.756 --> 29:55.781
And it's a very special one this year.

29:55.958 --> 29:59.018
The 150th birthday of our town.

30:02.264 --> 30:03.288
And...

30:03.465 --> 30:07.026
And I would like to welcome
back one of our town's favorite sons...

30:07.203 --> 30:10.229
...to do the honors of ringing
our official charter bell.

30:10.406 --> 30:13.569
John Gilbert,
would you please join me up here?

30:16.779 --> 30:22.081
One hundred and fifty years
of community, prosperity, family.

30:22.284 --> 30:25.913
We take care of each other.
We look after each other.

30:26.288 --> 30:27.846
We protect each other.

30:30.359 --> 30:32.350
It's good to be home.

30:39.101 --> 30:41.160
- Look at his right hand.
- Whose?

30:41.337 --> 30:43.897
The town's favorite son.
Look at his ring.

30:48.210 --> 30:51.839
- Well, looks like mine.
- Yeah, and that'd be a big coincidence...

30:52.014 --> 30:55.108
...if he didn't just come back
from the dead five minutes ago.

30:55.317 --> 30:58.844
- Where the hell did you get that ring?
- Isobel, my wife.

31:00.756 --> 31:02.917
Who gave birth to Elena...

31:03.092 --> 31:06.255
...under the medical care
of the esteemed Dr. Grayson Gilbert...

31:06.428 --> 31:08.362
...John's brother.

31:09.098 --> 31:11.362
You think John knew Isobel?

31:11.533 --> 31:14.593
I think John knows a lot of things.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.308
- Take care.
- Have a good night.

31:21.477 --> 31:23.843
Well, when's the last time
you were?

31:27.383 --> 31:31.046
Sorry about that, man.
I really am terribly sorry.

31:31.553 --> 31:33.578
You don't wanna do this, man.

31:36.425 --> 31:37.892
Sorry about that too.

31:38.627 --> 31:42.393
God, all I can do is apologize.
What's that about?

31:42.564 --> 31:44.862
Get out of my way, please.

31:48.370 --> 31:49.803
No girl to show off for now?

31:51.774 --> 31:54.242
I see how this is.

32:11.627 --> 32:12.685
What are you, man?

33:25.834 --> 33:27.597
Stefan?

33:30.606 --> 33:32.403
Stefan?

33:38.714 --> 33:42.047
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

33:42.785 --> 33:44.412
What happened?

33:48.223 --> 33:49.884
My arm.

33:50.893 --> 33:53.384
I lost my balance and fell.

33:54.229 --> 33:56.129
I'm clumsy.

34:04.907 --> 34:06.898
Good to see you guys.

34:10.779 --> 34:13.407
- Let's go.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.812
I don't even know what happened.

34:16.018 --> 34:19.078
I was drinking and I lost control.

34:20.822 --> 34:22.518
I can't explain it.

34:27.396 --> 34:30.092
That is the last time you ever embarrass
this family.

34:45.547 --> 34:48.947
- What are you doing? Matt, don't.
- I can't do it anymore, Mom.

34:49.118 --> 34:52.576
Just go, all right? You've done it before,
more times than I can count.

34:53.088 --> 34:54.146
I'm not leaving you.

34:55.924 --> 34:57.949
- Matty.
- Mom!

34:58.460 --> 35:01.793
Don't you get it?
I'm better off without you.

35:05.868 --> 35:07.597
No.

35:08.937 --> 35:10.529
Tonight was...

35:10.706 --> 35:12.071
God, I'm so sorry.

35:14.643 --> 35:17.942
I know I've failed you.
And I failed Vicki.

35:18.447 --> 35:21.314
But I won't do it to you again.

35:21.483 --> 35:24.281
I promise I'll get it together.

35:28.724 --> 35:30.885
I want you out of the house...

35:31.093 --> 35:33.857
...and my life by morning.

35:42.337 --> 35:44.362
Going somewhere, huh?

35:44.540 --> 35:46.974
I never like to be the last one
to leave a party.

35:47.142 --> 35:51.670
It's too desperate. Are you here to kill
me or are you gonna let Mr. Saltzman?

35:51.847 --> 35:54.680
- Okay, you obviously know who I am.
- I do.

35:54.850 --> 35:57.876
Alaric Saltzman, the high school
history teacher with a secret.

35:58.387 --> 36:01.220
Sure know a lot
for someone who just got to town.

36:01.390 --> 36:03.881
More than you can imagine, Damon.

36:04.059 --> 36:07.756
My knowledge of this town
goes beyond anything that you...

36:07.930 --> 36:10.330
...or you or the council knows.

36:10.499 --> 36:15.061
So if you were planning on some clever
high-speed-snatch-ring-vamp-kill move...

36:15.771 --> 36:17.864
...know that if I die...

36:18.040 --> 36:20.235
...everything I know
goes to the council...

36:20.409 --> 36:24.243
...including a fascinating little tale
of the original Salvatore brothers...

36:24.413 --> 36:26.904
...and their present-day return
to Mystic Falls.

36:27.916 --> 36:30.009
How'd you get that ring?

36:30.552 --> 36:33.851
I inherited one.
My brother Gray, the other.

36:34.022 --> 36:37.753
This was his. And I wouldn't
have given mine to Isobel...

36:37.926 --> 36:40.554
...had I known she'd hand it to a guy.
- You know her.

36:40.729 --> 36:43.596
Who sent her your way
when she wanted to become a vampire?

36:43.765 --> 36:45.357
- You sent her?
- Guilty.

36:46.401 --> 36:50.303
Why, did you think someone else
sent her? Maybe Katherine Pierce?

36:51.106 --> 36:54.075
- How do you know about Katherine?
- How do I know anything?

36:54.243 --> 36:55.870
What do you want?

36:56.044 --> 36:57.238
So many questions.

36:58.747 --> 37:02.183
It's a pleasure meeting you, Ric.
I've heard so much about you.

37:13.595 --> 37:17.395
I'm not so excited that we have another
month of these Founder's Day events.

37:17.566 --> 37:19.466
Tell me about it.

37:22.204 --> 37:24.468
- You okay?
- Fine.

37:25.807 --> 37:28.571
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine, Elena.

37:47.663 --> 37:51.030
- Oh, my God, you scared me.
- Sorry.

37:52.367 --> 37:54.335
I'm sorry that I ran off earlier.

37:54.503 --> 37:58.098
What happened? Is everything okay?

38:02.878 --> 38:04.368
No.

38:04.946 --> 38:06.777
Talk to me.

38:15.390 --> 38:17.153
Stefan, tell me.

38:18.660 --> 38:22.528
I tried so hard to keep it together
tonight.

38:23.899 --> 38:26.891
And it was working.
It was working, but...

38:27.069 --> 38:30.903
But then Matt's mom,
she got hurt and she was bleeding.

38:31.073 --> 38:34.065
And I had her blood on my hands.

38:34.276 --> 38:37.143
- And then what happened?
- And then l...

38:37.579 --> 38:40.309
That guy in the parking lot,
I wanted to feed on him.

38:40.482 --> 38:42.780
It took everything inside of me
not to do it.

38:43.385 --> 38:46.320
- But you didn't?
- No, but I wanted to.

38:46.488 --> 38:48.149
Oh, God.

38:48.323 --> 38:52.692
Elena, l... My head is pounding.

38:52.861 --> 38:56.854
I feel like my skin is on... Is on fire.

38:57.032 --> 38:59.523
I have this hunger inside of me
that I've never...

38:59.701 --> 39:02.033
I've never felt before in my entire life.

39:02.204 --> 39:05.901
All I keep thinking is how I promised
I would never keep anything from you.

39:06.074 --> 39:09.532
- And so I'm telling you this.
- It's okay. I need you to tell me things.

39:09.711 --> 39:11.838
But I don't want you
to see me like this.

39:12.013 --> 39:14.538
I don't want you to know
that this side of me exists.

39:14.716 --> 39:16.547
Stefan, you're gonna get through this.

39:16.718 --> 39:19.778
I'm gonna help you. It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

39:19.955 --> 39:21.752
No, no, no.

39:23.125 --> 39:24.820
I'm sorry.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.325
I can't, l...

39:28.730 --> 39:31.756
I'm afraid of what I could do to you.

39:33.902 --> 39:35.369
I'm not.

39:37.139 --> 39:40.836
Stefan. Stefan, I'm not.

39:44.646 --> 39:46.705
I'm not, okay?

39:58.160 --> 40:00.128
I love you so much.

40:01.797 --> 40:03.765
Oh, I love you too.

40:15.177 --> 40:16.508
We have a problem, Stefan.

40:16.678 --> 40:21.172
And when I say problem,
I mean global crisis.

40:22.284 --> 40:25.014
It seems Uncle John has...

40:28.457 --> 40:29.685
You don't look so good.

40:31.493 --> 40:35.259
It's different this time, isn't it?
The need is too strong.

40:37.165 --> 40:40.396
Of course it would be
after all these years.

40:52.047 --> 40:53.537
Have a good night, brother.
