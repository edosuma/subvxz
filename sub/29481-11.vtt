Maybe someone else
was watching him,

30:06.413 --> 30:08.241

30:13.333 --> 30:15.117

30:58.944 --> 31:02.904
Okay, so the client hires
Shoals to bug Gilroy, right?

31:02.948 --> 31:04.906
He hears him say
or do something,

31:04.950 --> 31:06.255

31:06.299 --> 31:08.562

31:21.923 --> 31:24.883

31:24.926 --> 31:27.363

Ava Mercer?

31:27.407 --> 31:29.931

Maybe Ava's the one

What about Gilroy and Ava?

Any tension between them?

32:09.362 --> 32:11.842
- Nothing like that, just some
friendly back and forth emails.

32:11.886 --> 32:14.323
- All right, then I think we
have to start at the beginning.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.195
Who is Ava Mercer?

32:16.238 --> 32:18.719
- She was born
on 10/13/95,

32:18.762 --> 32:20.764
Only child.
Grew up near Detroit.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.984
Went to Eastern Michigan
University.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.813
Her mother died in '97
when Ava was two.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.858
Ava was put in foster care,
and then adopted

Check this out.

32:32.602 --> 32:35.518
Ava's biological mother's name
is Carol Peluso.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.998
- So?

32:37.042 --> 32:39.392
- So Carol Peluso filed
a sexual assault allegation

32:39.435 --> 32:41.872
against Gilroy in '95,
then withdrew it.

32:41.916 --> 32:44.658
- Because Gilroy wrote her
a check for 200 grand.

32:44.701 --> 32:47.574
- Wait, so Ava's
biological mother worked

32:47.617 --> 32:51.012
for Gilroy in '95, claimed
he sexually assaulted her.

32:51.056 --> 32:54.015
And then that very same year,
gave birth to Ava,

32:54.059 --> 32:57.453

that Gilroy was courting

when we talked to her.

33:09.813 --> 33:12.555

a conspicuous omission.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.383

didn't make sense.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.300
It's from an audio file
recorded last week.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.215
Gilroy's in his car
on his phone.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.478
He's telling his lawyer
he wants to amend his will

33:22.522 --> 33:25.438

of his estate...

33:25.481 --> 33:26.874

a little bit of it.

to give 10 million a piece

he could do for them.

the whole idea was rash.

We were arguing about it
when he was killed.

to become a better man.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.438
that he was planning
on giving her all this money?

34:09.482 --> 34:11.571

she killed him--

34:11.614 --> 34:13.399
- Did she know
about the inheritance or not?

34:13.442 --> 34:15.879
- No, she wasn't even aware
that he was her father.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.098

34:17.142 --> 34:20.101

of his life.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.190
He said he had
tracked down Ava.

34:22.234 --> 34:23.626
He planned to tell her
who he was,

34:23.670 --> 34:25.193
but he wanted to get
to know her first.

34:25.237 --> 34:26.586

34:26.629 --> 34:28.892

actually changed his will.

he could sign them.
