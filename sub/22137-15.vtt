Nice to see you.

business going?

to do with the Freshman Prank

10:15.580 --> 10:16.920

Uh, no.
These are my mugs.

10:31.620 --> 10:33.120
Oh, okay.
I invented them.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.460
I gave them out
as Christmas gifts,

10:34.460 --> 10:37.750
and nobody wanted them,
so I'm taking them back.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.790
Uh, sorry.
You invented a

It's called a Shot-Mug.

in each one, so, you know...
Oh! Cool.

Shot-Mug.
Hey!

Measures the perfect shot
for you.

-Yeah, of course.
-Thanks.

Oh, I wouldn't actually
put coffee in it.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.500

Why?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.540
Well, evidently
the hot coffee

11:13.540 --> 11:16.580
melts the epoxy used to secure
the shot glass to the mug,

11:16.580 --> 11:18.830
and it's highly toxic,
so...

Well, I mean, I help
one person and hurt another.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.670
