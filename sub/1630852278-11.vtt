00:00.709 --> 00:06.548
You know, what--what's the first
thing they teach you in
kindergarten?

00:06.548 --> 00:09.050
- Uh, sharing is caring?

00:09.050 --> 00:10.010
- Wrong answer!

00:11.553 --> 00:13.763
Don't bet...

00:13.763 --> 00:14.806
what you don't have!

00:20.478 --> 00:22.230
Oh!

00:24.232 --> 00:26.192
- Usually I let Stinky
and his friend do this for me,

00:26.192 --> 00:28.778
but your moochery on this one,
Hal, was just so goddamn brazen.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.450
I mean, betting that kind of
money when you know you don't
have it.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.951
You don't even have a grand.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.412
Fuck, man.

00:37.412 --> 00:40.040
-
- You know what they call that?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.291
They call it taking a shot.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.376
- Come on, man.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.794
Can't we just work
something out?

00:49.966 --> 00:52.218
We are working this out.

00:52.218 --> 00:56.014
- ♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

00:58.391 --> 01:00.894
- Whenever anything
negative happens to you,

01:00.894 --> 01:04.314
there's a deep lesson
concealed within it,

01:04.314 --> 01:08.526
although you may not
see it at the time.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.947
- What the fuck?

01:25.085 --> 01:28.463
License and
registration, please.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.638
You know why I'm
pulling you over?

01:36.638 --> 01:38.348
- No.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.933
- Really?

01:39.933 --> 01:42.519
So you're still unaware of the
stop sign you just blew through?

01:42.519 --> 01:45.021
- Oh, I thought I stopped.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.023
- I'm pretty sure you didn't.

01:47.023 --> 01:50.360
- Oh...

01:50.360 --> 01:54.072
Maybe--maybe I missed that one.
- You can't miss 'em, ma'am.

01:54.072 --> 01:58.159
It's giant, red, octagon,
it's got "stop" right across it.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.204
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've had a horrible day.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.707
Look, since I've admitted it

02:04.707 --> 02:06.918
and if I say I'm really, really
sorry, could you please let me
off?

02:06.918 --> 02:08.711
- Can't do that.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.548
Uh, and you didn't
really admit it.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.175
- Well, I'm admitting it now.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.177
Please.

02:16.177 --> 02:20.181
- Look, I-I wish I could
help you, but what you did was
really bad.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.225
The next time you
could hurt someone

02:22.225 --> 02:24.352
or even yourself.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.271
I can't have you
blowing stop signs.

02:26.271 --> 02:30.066
- Okay, well...

02:30.066 --> 02:33.778
that stop sign's not the only
thing I could be blowing today.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.411
- Oh.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.496
- Hey, come on.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.623
Take your beating like a man.
-

02:45.623 --> 02:47.876
- You know?

02:47.876 --> 02:50.128
I'm being nicer about this
than I was with your buddy...

02:50.128 --> 02:51.629
Ed-o.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.217
- What?
You know Ed?

02:56.217 --> 02:59.012
- Yeah, we're good friends.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.764
You know, I-I saw you two
having lunch together.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.057
- - You seem like
really nice guys.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.229
I just really wish that
you'd pay your bills on time.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.733
- Oh, shit!

03:11.733 --> 03:13.943
God damn.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.321
Oh, I think I-I dribbled
a little in my pants.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.912
Jesus, Hal.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.749
- You realize you're just
doing this to yourself?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.792
I mean, I'm just a businessman.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.127
Normally, I wo--

03:32.879 --> 03:35.089
Oh, fuck.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.008
Oh, my--

03:37.008 --> 03:39.177
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.803
- Come on, man, you
think I'm that stupid?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.180
- Fuck! Fuck.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.559
I think I had some bad coke.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.312
Or maybe too much.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.439
- Oh, you're serious?
-

03:51.439 --> 03:53.483
- Oh, man.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.526
Maybe you got some of that
fentanyl stuff that's going
around.

03:55.526 --> 03:58.446
- Call an ambulance!
- What?

03:58.446 --> 04:00.240
Why would I do that?

04:00.240 --> 04:03.117
You're literally trying
to kill me right now.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.079
- I'm not trying to kill you.
I'm just trying to fuck you up
real bad.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.997
- Oh.
-

04:07.997 --> 04:11.584
- If I killed everyone who owed
me money, no one would owe me
money.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.211
Come on, man, please.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.421
- Fuck you, man.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.840
This is karma. Everything that's
happening to you right now, this
is karma.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.176
- Please, Hal.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.053
I don't want to die.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.936
- Oh, this is good. - Come on,
do the right thing, man.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.854
Do the right thing.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.148
- How about this?

04:34.148 --> 04:37.986
- Wipe that 10
- K I owe you,
I'll call 911 right now.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.071
- Go fuck yourself.
- Yeah...

04:40.071 --> 04:43.658
- Okay, okay.
Okay, yeah, okay.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.536
Okay, yeah, I'll
give you 36 months.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.663
- No interest.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.040
-
Okay.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.667
- And Ed gets the same deal.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.335
- Fuck Ed. Fuck him.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.754
- Hmm. Okay.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.798
Your call.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.967
- Oh, okay.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.469
O-okay, he can have 24 months.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.555
- Fuck you, man.
That's a shitty deal.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.598
36 months for both me and Ed.

05:07.598 --> 05:10.184
- No fucking way.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.061
No fucking way.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.356
36 for you, 24 for Ed.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.485
My final offer.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.450
- Okay, fine.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.993
Fine! Fuck!

05:29.746 --> 05:32.290
- Hal, you here?
I need some help, man.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.000
Oh, shit.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.919
Sorry, fellas. I'll--I'll
come back later.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.546
- Ed, get over here, man.
My bookie's dying.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.173
He just had a heart attack.
- What?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.424
- Yeah.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.718
- Dude, that's--that's Joon-Ho.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.720
T-t-this is the fucker
who had my finger cut off.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.263
- I know, man.
Small world, right?

05:47.263 --> 05:48.723
- What--what do we do?

05:48.723 --> 05:50.266
- I mean, I called an ambulance.
They're on their way.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.559
I-I've been blowing him
for, like, ten minutes.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.144
It's not working, man.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.979
- Oh, shit, I know CPR.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.356
Fuck.
- Ooh.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.733
- Don't wake up,
you motherfucker.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.409
- So let me get this straight.

06:08.409 --> 06:12.038
You two just saved the life of
the guy that chopped your finger
off

06:12.038 --> 06:13.998
and tried to kill you?

06:13.998 --> 06:16.334
- No, no, no, he was pretty
clear that he wasn't gonna kill
me.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.294
He just wanted to
fuck me up pretty bad.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.213
Otherwise, no one
would owe him money.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.299
- You still owe him
that boatload of money?

06:23.299 --> 06:27.929
- Well, yeah, but I was able to
negotiate a pretty sweet deal.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.472
- You made a deal with him?
- Oh, yeah.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.307
- What was it?

06:31.307 --> 06:33.059
- Pay him back over 36 months.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.977
No interest.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.730
- 36 months?
- Oh, yeah.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.149
- I got a better deal on my Kia.
- Really? Where?

06:40.149 --> 06:42.151
- Are you serious?

06:42.151 --> 06:45.905
You just saved his life, and he
gives you guys this three-year
bridge loan?

06:45.905 --> 06:49.367
- Uh, well, not technically us.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.453
It was kind of just me, but
I did get Ed a two-year loan.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.664
- Are you fucking kidding me?

06:54.664 --> 06:57.875
Why didn't you just have him
wipe the slate clean?

06:57.875 --> 07:00.211
- Okay, look, it's not like
I had a lot of leverage, okay?

07:00.211 --> 07:02.672
I mean, the guy
was just laying there, dying.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.715
- I don't think you understand
what leverage means.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.846
This is pretty much your fault
anyways. - How do you figure
that?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.514
- 'Cause before, I would've just
looked at him, and I would've
just said,

07:11.514 --> 07:13.141
you know, "Fuck you.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.226
Die, motherfucker."

07:15.226 --> 07:17.395
But then I did what
you've been saying,

07:17.395 --> 07:21.023
and I didn't think about how
much of an asshole he was in the
past,

07:21.023 --> 07:23.693
and I didn't think about what
he might do to me in the future.

07:23.693 --> 07:27.530
All I was thinking is that
right there, in that moment,

07:27.530 --> 07:30.116
he was just a guy
who needed help.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.034
So I helped him.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.744
- Okay.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.456
All right, I guess two years
is better than nothing.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.874
It's okay.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.209
- I'm sorry, man. I...

07:40.209 --> 07:43.045
I mean, the guy drove a hard
bargain. - That's all right. You
did good.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.673
You did good, man. - You know, I
had a now moment today.

07:45.673 --> 07:49.093
I pulled over
this very attractive woman who--

07:49.093 --> 07:51.679
She ran through a stop sign.

07:51.679 --> 07:54.640
- How does pulling over a hot
chick compare at all to saving a
guy's life?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.477
- Let me finish.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.606
So she's trying to get out of
the ticket, and she says
something slick like...

08:01.606 --> 08:03.900
"Hey, stud, the stop sign's
not the only thing

08:03.900 --> 08:05.818
that I could be sucking today."

08:05.818 --> 08:09.447
- That's aggressive
and makes no sense.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.157
- She said "blowing."

08:11.157 --> 08:13.326
"The stop sign isn't the only
thing I could blowing today."

08:13.326 --> 08:15.161
- Oh.
- Right.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.330
- That's good. That makes sense.
So what'd you do?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.665
- What do you think I did?
I gave her the ticket.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.126
- After she blew you?

08:22.126 --> 08:24.670
- No, Hal, no. I didn't
do that part, all right?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.339
I just wrote her up.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.884
- How is turning down a blow job
living in the now?

08:29.884 --> 08:33.054
I feel like that's got to be the
definition of not living in the
now.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.933
- Because I'm not
some fucking asshole cop, Hal.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.811
So I'm writing this chick up,
and I can feel her glaring at
me.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.564
And it--it just made me think.
Like, the world is fucked up.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.194
But it was less fucked up
when I had my wife.

08:50.321 --> 08:54.033
So, when I got in the car, I
called Julie, and I was brutally
honest.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.370
Let her know I messed up
and I'm sick about it.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.539
And I'd do anything
to get her back.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.165
- What'd she say?

09:01.165 --> 09:02.583
- Said she'll think about it.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.880
- That's not nothing.
- Not nothing at all.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.344
- Oh, uh, give me a minute.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.013
Yeah, I'm proud of
you boys, right?

09:16.013 --> 09:17.848
Hey, Ma.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.559
- Edward, I need you to get
back to the office right
away.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.394
- Why?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.854
- Roger Becker called. I don't
know. Something happened with
April.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.941
- Oh, shit.
