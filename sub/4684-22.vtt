WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:04.700
No, no, no!
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.766 --> 00:07.600
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.533 --> 00:13.833
Just seven years
after he killed a guard

00:13.900 --> 00:16.166
Andy's up for parole.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.066
He was never charged
with murder.

00:18.133 --> 00:20.033
Plea bargaining
is an everyday occurrence.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.700
We should not be releasing him.

00:21.766 --> 00:23.933
But there is nothing
that I can do.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.766
The prison shrink, though,
has a plan..

00:26.833 --> 00:28.600
No one gets away with murder.

00:28.666 --> 00:30.666
...to see Andy punished..

00:31.833 --> 00:32.833
Poor Andy.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.500
...on the next
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.133 --> 00:57.600
You're in Springwood now.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.533
And you're all mine.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.333
Freeze! Drop the bags.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.933
Open the doors.
Stand, stand back.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.833
Come on.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.033
Come on, man. Let's go.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.333
What ya shooting for?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.233
You've killed lots of guys

02:14.300 --> 02:16.033
Yeah, but I'm smart enough
to get away with it.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.133
You're an idiot!

02:17.200 --> 02:19.133
I'm not gonna get caught. Relax.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.333
Oh, Dr., uh, Uh-la-mo.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.600
Uh, Alamo.

02:36.666 --> 02:39.300
- Hello, warden.
- Yeah, of course, Alamo.

02:39.366 --> 02:42.866
Well, what do you think,
ya like your new job?

02:42.933 --> 02:46.133
Oh, well, so far
I only have one problem, um..

02:46.200 --> 02:48.566
'...is this office
gonna be permanent?'

02:48.633 --> 02:50.733
Well, I hope it's not
too antiquated for you.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.366
- Oh, I happen to love antiques.
- 'Mm.'

02:55.633 --> 02:57.533
Oh, is, is this
what you're looking for?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.100
Oh, thank you.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.433
From what I read in the papers,
you're gonna be

03:00.500 --> 03:02.200
the next sheriff of Springwood.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.200
Maybe I could have your office.

03:05.466 --> 03:07.666
Election isn't until two weeks

03:07.733 --> 03:10.300
thr-three weeks away, really.

03:10.366 --> 03:12.566
I'm not gonna count my chickens
just yet.

03:14.133 --> 03:17.566
If there's any problems
or questions, I'll be around.

03:17.633 --> 03:20.300
Oh, I'm sure,
I'll have, uh..

03:20.366 --> 03:22.300
...quite a few questions.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.633
Just got back from
four of my favorite banks.

03:31.700 --> 03:32.800
Made a withdrawal.

03:33.933 --> 03:36.400
First, I went to the blood bank.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.033
Then I went
to the eyeball bank.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.333
Then I went to the organ bank!

03:48.400 --> 03:50.500
Whoa!

03:50.566 --> 03:53.933
And finally,
I went to the sperm bank.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.033
"Substantial penalty
for early withdrawal."

04:09.333 --> 04:12.600
Are we ready for our session
with the new prison shrink?

04:12.666 --> 04:14.000
Why are you
wasting my time, man?

04:14.066 --> 04:16.133
I'm out of here in three days.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.900
You know, you gotta get he
stamp of approval

04:17.966 --> 04:20.833
before you get parole.
Let's go.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.466
I don't need no psychiatrist.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.100
I'm one hundred percent
rehabilitated.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.500
Ooh! Now, this clown's
another story.

04:29.566 --> 04:31.833
You should lock him up
and throw away the key.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.700
Shut your face..

04:33.766 --> 04:35.133
...Ratman.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.066
What'd you call me?

04:37.133 --> 04:39.833
You heard what I said.

04:41.166 --> 04:43.400
Hey! Hey, hey!

04:43.466 --> 04:45.500
Wish you two
were getting out of here today.

04:45.566 --> 04:47.800
Let's move!

04:47.866 --> 04:50.466
You described yourself
to the parole board

04:50.533 --> 04:53.666
as, uh, being born again.

04:53.733 --> 04:56.133
Tell me, exactly
what did you mean by that?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.466
I've accepted
the Lord into my life

05:00.533 --> 05:01.866
and He's given me the strength

05:01.933 --> 05:04.200
to endure this living hell.

05:04.266 --> 05:06.666
What he means is
he sucked up to the chaplain.

05:07.933 --> 05:11.066
Nowadays, I spend
most of my time

05:11.133 --> 05:12.666
reading "The Bible."

05:12.733 --> 05:14.033
The man can't even read.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.966
That's enough, Mr. Caulfield.

05:16.033 --> 05:17.333
Call me Andy.

05:18.366 --> 05:20.833
Alright...Andy.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.233
Tell me something.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.466
Do you feel like you understand

05:23.533 --> 05:25.900
what led you
to become a, a criminal?

05:25.966 --> 05:28.733
Oh, definitely, Dr. Uh-la-mo.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.933
Alamo.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.533
And you're, you're
confident that, uh

05:34.600 --> 05:36.166
you won't return
to a life of crime

05:36.233 --> 05:38.366
once you're out
in the real world?

05:38.433 --> 05:41.200
The joint has a way of teaching
you that crime doesn't pay.

05:41.266 --> 05:43.633
Oh, that's a bunch of bull!

05:43.700 --> 05:46.133
All he does is walk around

05:46.200 --> 05:49.166
telling everybody
how he got away with murder.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.366
Is that true, Andy?

05:50.433 --> 05:51.433
Do you, uh, feel like

05:51.500 --> 05:53.033
you got away with murder?

05:53.100 --> 05:55.333
I don't know what he's
talking about. I did my time.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.000
Seven years. Big deal.

05:58.866 --> 06:00.200
'You robbed an armored car'

06:00.266 --> 06:03.000
'and knocked off
a guard in the process.'

06:03.066 --> 06:05.566
'And then he
plea-bargains his way'

06:05.633 --> 06:07.433
'out of a murder charge'

06:07.500 --> 06:10.066
'by handing his partner over
to the cops.'

06:10.133 --> 06:13.000
Hey, Bruno Gaines was on
the FBI's most wanted list.

06:13.066 --> 06:15.766
I did society a favor
by diming him in.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.133
'He did himself a favor.'

06:18.200 --> 06:20.333
'Now, Bruno's on death row
at Joliet'

06:20.400 --> 06:23.033
and this guy skates away
like nothing's happened.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.133
Why is it you know so much
about Andy's case?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.600
Oh, everybody knows aboutAn

06:31.700 --> 06:34.900
That's how he got his nickname.

06:34.966 --> 06:36.533
Shut up, stupid.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.100
What nickname?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.566
I said, shut up!

06:41.633 --> 06:44.000
Oh, you mean, uh, Ratman?

06:44.066 --> 06:46.300
You son of a bitch.

06:46.366 --> 06:48.100
Guard?

06:48.166 --> 06:49.566
'Guard?'

06:50.833 --> 06:52.266
Hey, break it up!

06:52.333 --> 06:54.966
I said, break it up!

06:55.033 --> 06:56.000
'What's the matter,
don't you guys know'

06:56.066 --> 06:58.066
how to behave
in front of a lady?

06:58.133 --> 07:00.233
- You alright, ma'am?
- Yes, thank you.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.633
Alright. Session's over, boys.
Let's go.

07:06.566 --> 07:08.333
Hey, knock that crap off!

07:10.600 --> 07:13.233
Oh, hello, uh, Warden Hendler.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.766
Hi.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.566
Uh, do you wanna see me?

07:16.633 --> 07:19.400
Uh, yes, I...wanted to ask you

07:19.466 --> 07:21.766
if I could buy you
a drink after work?

07:21.833 --> 07:24.400
Oh..

07:24.466 --> 07:26.733
I am afraid that I'm gonna
have to take a rain check.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.366
I've got a speech tonight
to the Chamber of Commerce

07:30.433 --> 07:32.033
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.033
You're in the middle
of an election campaign, I..

07:35.100 --> 07:36.466
Something you wanna talk about?

07:36.533 --> 07:40.400
Uh, actually, yes.
There was, um..

07:40.466 --> 07:42.766
I was interested in knowing

07:42.833 --> 07:44.666
why you recommended
Andy Caulfield

07:44.733 --> 07:46.833
for an early parole?

07:46.900 --> 07:49.033
Uh, w-what about it?

07:49.100 --> 07:51.833
Well, his record clearly states
that he shot and killed a man.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.366
And from what I've seen,
he shows little

07:53.433 --> 07:55.633
if any, remorse.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.966
Well, the record also states

07:57.033 --> 07:59.033
that he was never charged
with murder.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.566
Well, that's because
he turned state's evidence.

08:01.633 --> 08:03.300
Well, the DA wanted his partner

08:03.366 --> 08:05.633
so they cut a deal with Andy.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.200
Look, all I know
is that he was tried

08:08.266 --> 08:10.733
and sentenced
in a court of law!

08:10.800 --> 08:13.400
Plea bargaining
is an everyday occurrence.

08:13.466 --> 08:14.933
I mean, that's the way
the system operates.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.200
But warden

08:17.266 --> 08:18.433
I am telling you

08:18.500 --> 08:21.466
that Andy Caulfield
is a violent man.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.566
'And we should not be
releasing him'

08:23.633 --> 08:24.900
'from this facility.'

08:24.966 --> 08:28.100
But there is nothing
that I can do.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.633
'Now, if you feel
that strongly about it'

08:29.700 --> 08:31.133
I suggest that you

08:31.200 --> 08:33.600
petition the parole board.

08:33.666 --> 08:36.300
'Otherwise, in three days
Caulfield goes free.'

08:37.300 --> 08:38.500
Uh, do you know what time it is?

08:38.566 --> 08:40.200
I have no idea.

08:40.266 --> 08:42.433
Oh, I'm afraid that, uh

08:42.500 --> 08:43.933
if you have anything else
to discuss

08:44.000 --> 08:46.733
it's gonna have to wait
until morning.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.766
'Paging Warden Hendler.'

08:48.833 --> 08:50.533
'Paging Warden Hendler.'

09:05.533 --> 09:06.633
Hello.

09:07.566 --> 09:10.533
Uh, is-is this Joliet Prison?

09:10.600 --> 09:13.166
No, I'm sorry.
I think we had a bad co..

09:13.233 --> 09:14.166
Oh, yeah, that's better.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.300
Uh, Warden Myers, please.

09:20.066 --> 09:23.700
Warden Myers?
Yes, this is Dr. Alamo.

09:23.766 --> 09:25.100
I just wanted to know if the, uh

09:25.166 --> 09:27.400
prisoner transfer
had been approved.

09:29.433 --> 09:31.166
Oh, absolutely, uh,
Warden Hendler

09:31.233 --> 09:33.200
has no problem
with it whatsoever.

09:36.366 --> 09:37.533
Excellent.

09:38.933 --> 09:40.833
Uh, yes, so..

09:40.900 --> 09:44.466
'Yeah, we'll be expecting
Bruno Gaines within, um..'

09:44.533 --> 09:45.933
...three days?

09:47.900 --> 09:49.433
Yes, thank you very much.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.566
Hey!

09:59.633 --> 10:03.200
You know, my mom said that
my room is just like I left it.

10:03.266 --> 10:05.533
Man, you're such a candy ass.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.133
Running home to your mommy. Aw..

10:08.200 --> 10:10.533
Oh, what are you gonna do,
wise guy?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.666
I haven't decided yet.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.700
Maybe I'll buy me a yacht..

10:14.766 --> 10:15.733
...or a penthouse or something.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.700
Hey, the only penthouse
that you're gonna buy

10:19.766 --> 10:22.200
is the one with
the dirty pictures in it.

10:23.866 --> 10:25.133
Why not?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.500
I got a nice piece of cash
waiting for me.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.466
How much?

10:35.533 --> 10:37.400
Man, don't you ever wonder
what happened to that money

10:37.466 --> 10:40.366
from the armored-car heist
that me and Bruno pulled off?

10:40.433 --> 10:42.400
You stashed all that dough?

10:44.633 --> 10:47.366
Oh, get out of here, man!

10:47.433 --> 10:49.100
Fine. Don't believe me.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.400
Just don't come crawlin' to me

10:50.466 --> 10:52.733
beggin' for a loan.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.733
And what happens
if Bruno finds you?

10:56.466 --> 10:59.900
Bruno's never getting out
of Joliet.

10:59.966 --> 11:01.266
Not alive, anyway.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.800
'Yo, Andy.'

11:02.866 --> 11:04.033
'Hop to it.'

11:04.100 --> 11:06.033
'Somebody wants to talk to you.'

11:07.833 --> 11:09.800
'I'll be right with you.'

11:30.600 --> 11:33.366
I, uh, wanted you to see this

11:33.433 --> 11:35.333
before I submitted it to the, uh

11:35.400 --> 11:36.766
parole board.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.733
What's this?

11:47.433 --> 11:49.866
What do you want me
to read this for?

11:49.933 --> 11:53.100
It's a request
to deny your release.

11:55.233 --> 11:57.300
You can't do this, lady.

11:57.366 --> 11:59.033
I'm outta here in two days.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.966
I wouldn't count on that, Andy.

12:02.033 --> 12:03.400
Not after
the members of the board

12:03.466 --> 12:07.233
read about your
selfish, arrogant attitude

12:07.300 --> 12:09.000
your uncontrollable belligerence

12:09.066 --> 12:10.733
and hostility toward authority

12:10.800 --> 12:12.366
as well as your peers.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.700
Look, if you're
talking about me and Mac

12:14.766 --> 12:17.033
we were just
blowing off some steam, okay?

12:18.700 --> 12:21.700
You're not ready to be let out
on the streets, Andy.

12:21.766 --> 12:23.733
And I'm gonna see to it
that you don't get out.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.300
Ever.

12:27.366 --> 12:29.566
What's with you, lady?

12:29.633 --> 12:31.933
You tried so hard
to make me look bad.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.233
I got no beef with you.

12:33.300 --> 12:36.133
That's where
you are&lt;

12:37.400 --> 12:39.766
Does the name Richard Barbian

12:39.833 --> 12:41.400
mean anything to you?

12:41.466 --> 12:43.633
No. I don't know
no Richard Barbian.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.200
'Oh, that's right.
You don't know.'

12:45.266 --> 12:47.333
'You never did get the chance
to know him, did you?'

12:48.500 --> 12:51.233
Richard Barbian was
the transit armored guard

12:51.300 --> 12:54.466
you shot in cold blood
seven years ago!

12:54.533 --> 12:57.833
I was 18 years old when he died.

12:57.900 --> 13:01.500
And I swore that one day
I would avenge his death.

13:03.633 --> 13:05.400
You see, Richard Barbian..

13:08.700 --> 13:11.700
...Richard Barbian
was my father.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.166
How ya livin', Andy?

13:20.233 --> 13:22.733
Livin' large and lookin' fine.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.600
The world smells a little better
when you're a free man.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.566
I don't know.

13:29.633 --> 13:32.333
I'm a free man
and all I smell is garbage.

13:33.433 --> 13:35.300
I'd love to sit
and rap with you..

13:35.366 --> 13:38.766
...but I believe,
I have a date with destiny.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.500
Let's rock and roll.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.033
Andy, this is the first da
of the rest of your life.

13:48.100 --> 13:51.133
And God helps them
that helps themselves.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.866
I'm outta here, man.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.500
And I don't have to listen
to no more

13:54.566 --> 13:56.200
inspirational speeches.

13:56.266 --> 13:58.233
Just open the door.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.066
Hey, wrong door, man.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.833
I reviewed your case, Andy.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.166
'You're one of those rats
who sits with the cats'

14:17.233 --> 14:18.766
in our justice system.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.666
What's going on here?
You can't do this!

14:22.733 --> 14:24.100
I want to talk to my lawyer!

14:24.166 --> 14:26.166
Lawyers are part
of the problem, Andy

14:26.233 --> 14:28.333
so are judges and juries.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.833
You know what they say?

14:29.900 --> 14:31.400
If you want something done right

14:31.466 --> 14:33.266
you gottadoit yourself.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.300
Well, I'm gonna do you myself.

14:36.366 --> 14:38.066
You're crazy, lady!

14:38.133 --> 14:39.166
You can't do this!

14:39.233 --> 14:41.300
I hereby find you guilty

14:41.366 --> 14:43.066
of the murder of my father

14:43.133 --> 14:44.466
Richard Barbian.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.133
And the sentence is death!

14:47.200 --> 14:49.333
But I was never charged
with murder!

14:49.400 --> 14:51.200
Oh, well,
if it's a charge you want

14:51.266 --> 14:52.933
you've come to the right place.

14:57.133 --> 14:59.833
No one gets away
with murder, Andy.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.766
Hey, Caulfield.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.466
Yeah?

15:21.533 --> 15:25.066
Thought you might wanna know
there was a breakout last night.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.300
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't see nothing, okay?

15:27.366 --> 15:29.500
Not here, in Springwood.

15:29.566 --> 15:31.266
At Joliet..

15:31.333 --> 15:33.700
...four men escaped.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.966
Yeah? So what's that got
to do with me?

15:36.033 --> 15:38.066
One of 'em was Bruno Gaines.

15:46.733 --> 15:49.333
Like I said,
what's that got to do with me?

15:49.400 --> 15:51.000
That lady shrink of yours
is seeing to it

15:51.066 --> 15:53.966
that I'm gonna be in here
for a very long time

15:54.033 --> 15:57.066
so that Bruno Gaines
can't touch me.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.300
I got nothin' to worry about.

15:59.366 --> 16:01.400
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.100
'Hey, Nita, check out
the new&lt;

16:11.333 --> 16:12.500
Hi, Andy.

16:13.866 --> 16:16.166
What are you doin' here?

16:16.233 --> 16:17.833
I came to apologize

16:17.900 --> 16:19.433
for letting my emotions

16:19.500 --> 16:21.666
cloud my professional judgment.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.233
I was wrong to try
to prevent your release.

16:25.866 --> 16:27.533
Yeah?

16:27.600 --> 16:28.733
Bull.

16:30.166 --> 16:32.633
Why are you doin' this, lady?

16:32.700 --> 16:34.733
You heard about Bruno,
didn't you?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.500
Well, I arranged for Bruno

16:36.566 --> 16:38.666
to be transferred here,
but you see

16:38.733 --> 16:42.066
he fouled up my plan
by escaping last night.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.800
As much as I'd love
to kill you myself

16:43.866 --> 16:47.200
I don't think I'd be nearly
as effective as Bruno.

16:47.266 --> 16:48.400
Are you kidding?

16:48.466 --> 16:50.366
You're a free man, Andy.

16:50.433 --> 16:51.866
Don't do that!

16:51.933 --> 16:53.866
Tomorrow when you
walk out of here

16:53.933 --> 16:55.600
Bruno's gonna gun you down

16:55.666 --> 16:58.033
just like
you gunned down my father.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.333
Guard?

17:01.400 --> 17:02.533
'Come on, doctor, I got this..'

17:02.600 --> 17:05.133
You can't do this.
You've got to let me stay!

17:06.466 --> 17:08.533
I'm afraid it'sadios,&lt;row16

17:10.700 --> 17:12.933
Get back here, lady!
Get back here!

17:14.366 --> 17:16.000
I'm not goin' nowhere!

17:16.066 --> 17:17.933
You hear what I'm saying?

17:21.966 --> 17:23.933
How you livin', Andy?

17:27.600 --> 17:29.700
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving.

18:14.733 --> 18:17.233
What are you waitin' for?
Let's go!

18:17.300 --> 18:18.466
Let's go!

18:21.966 --> 18:23.866
'He can't drive you anywhere.'

18:23.933 --> 18:26.333
He's dead.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.200
Don't you recognize him yet?

18:30.266 --> 18:33.433
'That's the guard you did
when you were bein' stupid.'

18:33.500 --> 18:35.900
Bruno, I didn't mean to.

18:35.966 --> 18:37.300
I did what I had to do!

18:37.366 --> 18:38.733
Yup.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.366
Now I'm gonna do..

18:40.433 --> 18:42.400
...what I've gotta do.

18:43.433 --> 18:45.966
So long, Ratman.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.300
How're you living, Andy?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.066
Well..

18:59.133 --> 19:00.633
...time to go.

19:02.233 --> 19:04.233
You're a free man.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.066
Hey, Andy!

19:09.133 --> 19:11.533
Say hi to Bruno for me.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.866
Boy, I hope you get to spend
all that money

19:13.933 --> 19:16.033
before Bruno finds you.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.466
What money?

19:17.533 --> 19:19.566
All the money
from the armored car robbery.

19:19.633 --> 19:21.900
Andy here's been hiding it
all these years.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.700
Is that true, Andy?

19:26.766 --> 19:28.733
- Talk to my lawyer.
- Mm-hmm.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.900
Ricardo.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.400
No one gets away with murder.

19:48.266 --> 19:49.966
I won, lady!

19:50.033 --> 19:52.000
'I'm staying alive!'

19:56.700 --> 19:59.033
I don't get it, Andy.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.500
You were five steps
from freedom.

20:01.566 --> 20:03.966
Freedom?

20:04.033 --> 20:06.300
With Bruno out there
lookin' for me?

20:06.366 --> 20:08.466
Oh, you screwed up.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.633
Bruno was recaptured last night.

20:11.766 --> 20:13.466
- What?
- 'Yeah, you were right.'

20:13.533 --> 20:15.033
'He was on his way
to Springwood'

20:15.100 --> 20:16.466
'looking to kill ya.'

20:16.533 --> 20:18.500
We just found him first.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.366
Cheer up.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.533
You got a visitor.

20:30.166 --> 20:33.333
Well, I guess you two
wanna be, uh, left alone.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.866
Hey!

20:34.933 --> 20:36.233
Hey!

20:36.300 --> 20:37.800
- Hey, hey!
- Ah!

20:39.000 --> 20:42.566
Mac, you didn't hear
any of that, did ya?

20:42.633 --> 20:43.733
'No!'

20:44.866 --> 20:46.800
Hear any of what, warden?

20:51.933 --> 20:54.766
Don't let Bruno kill him..

20:54.833 --> 20:56.800
...but let him come real close.

21:01.933 --> 21:03.933
Poor Andy.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.633
He got Bruno for a cellmate.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.066
Ooh, but that ain't nothin'.

21:09.133 --> 21:11.266
Meet Guss here.

21:11.333 --> 21:12.833
Hey, uh..

21:12.900 --> 21:15.800
Guss got me for a cellmate

21:21.800 --> 21:24.433
Guss, fetch the soap.

21:34.166 --> 21:35.400
The following is a paid
political announcement.

21:35.466 --> 21:37.333
'Springwood Prison warden,
Dean Hendler says'

21:37.400 --> 21:38.666
'that he's tough on crime.'

21:38.733 --> 21:39.900
You better believe it.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.266
We haven't had&lt;col4
in two weeks.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.066
'Those were the words
of Andy Caulfield'

21:44.133 --> 21:46.600
'convicted felon
and lifelong slime bucket.'

21:46.666 --> 21:48.300
'He is voting
for Warden Hendler.'

21:48.366 --> 21:49.833
'If you're a scum sucking pig'

21:49.900 --> 21:52.100
'you too should vote
for Warden Dean Hendler.'

21:52.166 --> 21:54.166
'But if you're a concerned,
decent citizen of Springwood'

21:54.233 --> 21:56.300
'vote for a sheriff
who can get the job done'

21:56.366 --> 21:57.600
'someone who looks good
in a uniform'

21:57.666 --> 21:59.533
'and can really
throw her weight around.'

21:59.600 --> 22:01.400
'So vote once, no, vote twice'

22:01.466 --> 22:03.466
'for Sheila Reinfeld!'

22:06.433 --> 22:07.500
'Paid for by the committee'

22:07.566 --> 22:09.633
'to elect
Sheila Reinfeld sheriff.'

22:16.433 --> 22:17.700
What is it?

22:18.866 --> 22:20.600
Oh, put him through.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.433
Hello, Charlie!

22:26.100 --> 22:28.166
Y-yes, yes.

22:28.233 --> 22:30.200
Yeah, I've read the polls.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.200
Uh, I realize
I'm trailing Reinfeld

22:34.266 --> 22:36.500
by 20 points, yes.

22:36.566 --> 22:38.266
Well, it's those
damn commercials she's running.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.300
Where did she get
that kinda money?

22:42.133 --> 22:44.166
Look, Charlie.

22:44.233 --> 22:47.500
Look, we gotta do
something dramatic.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.200
Yeah, right!

22:57.266 --> 22:59.333
Vote for Warden Hendler

22:59.400 --> 23:00.933
for a kinder

23:01.000 --> 23:03.766
gentler Springwood.

23:03.833 --> 23:06.866
Over my dead body

23:06.933 --> 23:08.333
and his.

23:14.766 --> 23:16.366
Well..

23:16.433 --> 23:18.933
...I hope you don't take this
the wrong way.

23:20.766 --> 23:24.000
But I hope I never
see you again in my life.

23:24.066 --> 23:25.966
I have a feeling that you won't.

23:26.033 --> 23:27.233
Certainly.

23:28.766 --> 23:31.400
Hey, one last chance to tell me

23:31.466 --> 23:34.700
where that stolen money
of yours is hidden.

23:34.766 --> 23:36.666
Dream on, slime ball.

23:36.733 --> 23:37.700
Well, you give me a call

23:37.766 --> 23:40.866
if you change your mind.

23:40.933 --> 23:43.000
And I'll see you around..

23:43.066 --> 23:44.533
...Ratman.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.933
Later, warden.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.500
Yeah.

23:49.566 --> 23:51.233
Good luck, Mac.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.200
That could have been you, Andy.

23:56.700 --> 23:59.966
I could talk
to the DA maybe, hm?

24:00.033 --> 24:03.400
You'd be eligible
for parole in five years.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.900
Let me guess.

24:10.966 --> 24:14.466
You're gonna do this out of the
goodness of your heart, right?

24:14.533 --> 24:16.600
Of course not.

24:16.666 --> 24:18.466
In return..

24:18.533 --> 24:20.000
...you're gonna tell me
where you hid the money

24:20.066 --> 24:21.833
from the job
that you and Bruno pulled

24:21.900 --> 24:24.733
on the Springwood
armored transport.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.200
Man, you think
I've got a death wish?

24:27.266 --> 24:29.633
The only reason why Bruno
hasn't killed me already

24:29.700 --> 24:30.966
is because I'm the only one

24:31.033 --> 24:32.333
that knows where that money is.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.066
Andy..

24:34.133 --> 24:35.400
...you're a young man.

24:35.466 --> 24:37.600
You've got at least 35

24:37.666 --> 24:40.333
maybe 40 years ahead of you.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.433
You wanna spend 'em all here?

24:44.133 --> 24:46.833
Why not? You'll be here with me.

24:46.900 --> 24:47.866
You think so?

24:47.933 --> 24:49.400
Word is you ain't

24:49.466 --> 24:51.133
doin' so hot in the polls.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.233
Well, that's true.
No, thanks to you.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.100
People are
holding me responsible

24:56.166 --> 24:58.866
for the murder
that you committed.

24:58.933 --> 25:00.933
Life's rough all over.

25:04.366 --> 25:07.666
But it can get easier
for both you and me.

25:07.733 --> 25:10.000
You tell me where the money is,
and we both win.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.300
How you figure that?

25:13.366 --> 25:15.900
I win that election on Tuesday

25:15.966 --> 25:18.333
you win your freedom.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.433
What good is freedom
if you're dead?

25:22.500 --> 25:23.533
No, can do, warden.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.433
No, now listen to me!

25:25.500 --> 25:26.966
Hey, man, a brutality charge

25:27.033 --> 25:29.633
isn't gonna help
your campaign any..

25:29.700 --> 25:30.933
'...warden.'

25:36.066 --> 25:38.066
- Doc! Tell me.
- Yeah.

25:38.133 --> 25:40.633
Uh-uh, uh, how's that, uh,
new drug

25:40.700 --> 25:43.100
you've been working on?

25:43.166 --> 25:45.233
- DRF4?
- Hm.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.766
Yeah, it'd be moving right along
if you hadn't denied

25:47.833 --> 25:49.933
my drug testing program.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.600
Listen, I'm 20 points behind
in the polls now, Douglas.

25:53.666 --> 25:55.700
Can't afford
any more controversy.

25:55.766 --> 25:58.266
Well, DRF4

25:58.333 --> 26:01.200
is the ultimate hallucinogenic.

26:01.266 --> 26:03.633
It's true, sir.

26:03.700 --> 26:06.300
It sounds like
science fiction to me.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.133
Didn't you read my treatise?

26:11.266 --> 26:13.433
DRF4 opens the brain

26:13.500 --> 26:17.000
up to...any suggestion.

26:17.066 --> 26:18.700
You could tell them
that you are the President

26:18.766 --> 26:21.400
of the United States,
and they will see you

26:21.466 --> 26:24.033
as the President
of the United States.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.700
Tell 'em that they are los
out in the middle

26:25.766 --> 26:27.433
of the wilderness,
and they will think

26:27.500 --> 26:29.900
that they are out in the middle
of the wilderness.

26:33.033 --> 26:34.200
How do you know it works?

26:34.266 --> 26:36.133
Well, I..

26:36.200 --> 26:38.033
I can't be, uh, certain

26:38.100 --> 26:39.366
unless I..

26:39.433 --> 26:42.133
...can test it
on several prisoners.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.500
- One prisoner.
- What? No, that's crazy!

26:46.566 --> 26:49.033
No experimental subject
can be conducted

26:49.100 --> 26:51.133
with u-using just one subject.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.733
Well, you have
a choice, Douglas.

26:53.800 --> 26:54.966
You can spend years

26:55.033 --> 26:57.566
going through
official FDA channels

26:57.633 --> 27:01.166
or you can conduct
your experiment here

27:01.233 --> 27:02.900
with one prisoner..

27:02.966 --> 27:04.900
...unofficially.

27:04.966 --> 27:06.966
Charlie..

27:07.033 --> 27:08.866
...we're about to pull off

27:08.933 --> 27:12.233
one of the greatest
come-from-behind..

27:13.733 --> 27:16.700
...victories in the history

27:16.766 --> 27:18.733
of Springwood politics.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.033
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
how I'm gonna do it

27:23.100 --> 27:27.500
by solving the biggest unsolved
case in this town!

27:29.000 --> 27:30.433
'This stuff isn't
gonna hurt me, is it?'

27:30.500 --> 27:33.000
Shh. It's safe, Andy.
Don't worry.

27:34.666 --> 27:36.800
What's this stuff called?
Maybe I've heard of it.

27:36.866 --> 27:38.533
'All you need to know
is that you're helping'

27:38.600 --> 27:40.833
millions of cancer patients.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.700
I don't care about that.

27:42.766 --> 27:45.566
All I care about is that
I'm outta here in five years.

27:45.633 --> 27:47.900
That's our deal, right?

27:47.966 --> 27:50.133
Yes, Andy..

27:50.200 --> 27:53.433
...as long as you keep this
absolutely confidential.

27:55.033 --> 27:57.900
Okay, now, Andy..

27:57.966 --> 27:59.666
...when this drug takes effect

27:59.733 --> 28:02.266
you're going to experience
some discomfort

28:02.333 --> 28:05.000
some nausea, kinda like
a bad hangover.

28:05.066 --> 28:07.533
Hm, and just as long as
it doesn't make me

28:07.600 --> 28:09.300
grow another leg
or nothin' like that.

28:09.366 --> 28:11.366
- No, no, nothing like that.
- Mm-hmm.

28:11.433 --> 28:14.433
Oh, no, by tomorrow
you should be perfectly fine!

28:14.500 --> 28:17.700
Come on, trust me, Andy.
Trust me, it's perfectly safe.

28:17.766 --> 28:20.566
I trust you, doc.

28:20.633 --> 28:22.633
What do I need these for, hm?

28:22.700 --> 28:25.800
Oh, that's, uh,
that's for your own protection.

28:25.866 --> 28:28.033
Your own protection. Alright.

28:29.733 --> 28:32.133
'Now..'

28:39.766 --> 28:43.166
It is, uh, 5:42 p.m.

28:43.233 --> 28:46.500
and I am administering DRF4

28:46.566 --> 28:49.333
intravenously.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.433
And the patient

28:50.500 --> 28:51.833
is starting to hyperventilate.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.366
Hey.

28:56.433 --> 28:57.600
Hey.

29:03.666 --> 29:06.533
It's alright.
Alright, relax.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.966
Relax, relax, okay.

29:10.033 --> 29:12.633
Relax, relax.

29:25.066 --> 29:27.033
You may begin now.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.800
'Andy.'

29:35.866 --> 29:37.433
Wake up call for you.

29:39.566 --> 29:42.733
My head. Where am I?

29:42.800 --> 29:45.266
'You're in your cell this day.'

29:45.333 --> 29:46.833
'It's me, Bruno.'

29:50.166 --> 29:52.233
Relax, I'm not gonna hurt ya.

29:52.300 --> 29:54.433
I just want some information,
that's all.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.566
What kind of information?

29:58.633 --> 30:01.133
Tell me where you hid the money?

30:01.200 --> 30:04.766
You turned me in, man.
You owe me.

30:04.833 --> 30:08.900
You're in for life.
What good is that money to you?

30:08.966 --> 30:12.566
Because, um,
I'm bustin' outta here.

30:12.633 --> 30:16.000
How you gonna do that?

30:16.066 --> 30:18.866
'Same way I got into this cell.'

30:18.933 --> 30:21.166
I have a master key.

30:21.233 --> 30:24.966
I lifted it off
one of the guards.

30:25.033 --> 30:27.533
Now, you tell me
where the money is..

30:27.600 --> 30:29.733
...and I'll be gone.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.933
How do I know you won't kill
me when I tell you

30:33.000 --> 30:34.766
where that money's hid?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.266
All's I want is the money.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.300
Word to the mother, Andy.

30:43.233 --> 30:44.866
Okay, you take me with you.

30:44.933 --> 30:46.400
You get me outta here
and I'll show you

30:46.466 --> 30:48.533
where that money's hid.

30:53.566 --> 30:56.666
- Okay. Let's go now.
- Are you crazy?

30:56.733 --> 31:00.000
- It's daylight out there.
- Alright, alright.

31:00.066 --> 31:03.400
We'll go tonight.
Now, you get some sleep.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.533
You're gonna need your rest.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.933
Guard!

31:24.333 --> 31:27.700
- Jeez, Andy, you okay?
- I'm sick.

31:28.866 --> 31:31.000
Listen, do me a favor.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.400
Tell Bruno
I can't see him tonight.

31:34.466 --> 31:36.366
He'll understand.

31:36.433 --> 31:39.266
Well, it'll be pretty toug
to tell Bruno anything.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.300
He got the chair last night.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.200
The big zapperoo,
10,000 volts.

31:43.266 --> 31:45.066
Whammo! Right through
the old brainola.

31:45.133 --> 31:46.566
What?

31:46.633 --> 31:49.733
Hey, didn't you notice
how the lights dimmed?

31:49.800 --> 31:52.033
Hey, where you,
where you been, Andy?

31:53.933 --> 31:56.033
I wish I knew.

32:12.366 --> 32:16.133
You, uh, collapsed in your cell.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.666
Guard brought you here.

32:17.733 --> 32:19.533
What's happening, doc?

32:19.600 --> 32:24.000
It's, uh, it's reaction
to the drug.

32:24.066 --> 32:25.933
I feel like I'm comin' apart.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
give you something

32:28.066 --> 32:29.400
that'll help you to relax.

32:29.466 --> 32:32.400
No, no, no, no more drugs.

32:32.466 --> 32:34.333
Tell me somethin'.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.733
Did Bruno get the chair
last night?

32:36.800 --> 32:39.000
Uh, no, no.

32:39.066 --> 32:41.533
Bruno was supposed to be
electrocuted last night

32:41.600 --> 32:45.533
but the governor issued a stay
at the last minute.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.366
Uh, one of the guards
said that Bruno

32:47.433 --> 32:49.100
was down by your cell
this morning.

32:49.166 --> 32:51.566
What did he say to you?

32:51.633 --> 32:53.266
Musta been somebody else.

32:53.333 --> 32:55.833
Bruno and me don't got
nothing to talk about.

32:55.900 --> 32:59.966
Well, what do you remember
about the test yesterday?

33:00.033 --> 33:02.266
I was in the infirmary
and then I woke up

33:02.333 --> 33:05.733
in my cell feeling like crap.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.600
Look at my face, man.
It's dancin'.

33:08.666 --> 33:10.700
And my nose can't stop bleedin'.

33:10.766 --> 33:13.166
That's too bad.

33:13.233 --> 33:15.366
Why don't you go with the guard
and get washed up

33:15.433 --> 33:18.333
and then be back here at
5 o'clock for your second test?

33:18.400 --> 33:22.133
Hey, are you crazy? How many
times do I gotta do this?

33:22.200 --> 33:25.433
Andy, we have a deal.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.566
Or would you rather spend
the rest of your life

33:27.633 --> 33:29.733
taking showers with Bruno?

33:32.366 --> 33:35.000
I thought you'd see it my way.

33:36.166 --> 33:38.100
Well, it's too dangerous.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.433
No. His body needs
time to recover.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.766
- Maybe a few weeks.
- We don't have a few weeks.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.800
Election's in two days.

33:47.166 --> 33:49.700
'That idiot Reinfeld
is already claiming victory.'

33:49.766 --> 33:51.933
The only way
I could possibly win

33:52.000 --> 33:53.600
is if I recover that money.

33:53.666 --> 33:55.033
Yeah, well,
you just look at him.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.633
'Now, Andy could
suffer permanent'

33:56.700 --> 33:58.333
'brain damage or worse.'

33:58.400 --> 34:00.000
No, this whole thing stinks.

34:00.066 --> 34:01.933
Calm down, Douglas.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.733
You're losing sight
of one very important fact.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.600
- He's a murderer.
- Oh, get away.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.200
If this drug kills him,
now what does that make us?

34:14.800 --> 34:16.333
No, I won't do it.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.766
Need I remind you that this test

34:18.833 --> 34:21.166
that you've conducted
doesn't exactly conform

34:21.233 --> 34:24.966
with the, uh,
guidelines of the AMA?

34:25.033 --> 34:26.700
I wonder if they'd like
to hear about it.

34:26.766 --> 34:29.500
Maybe publish it
in some journal or something.

34:29.566 --> 34:32.733
Alright, enough, look.
Dean, please.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.733
DRF4..

34:36.500 --> 34:39.233
My whole life's work
is at stake here.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.266
So's mine.

34:41.333 --> 34:43.600
I'll see you at 5 o'clock.

34:46.566 --> 34:48.733
'This is the last time, right?'

34:48.800 --> 34:50.733
Word to the mother, Andy.

34:56.666 --> 34:59.133
Patient's beginning
to hyperventilate.

35:05.466 --> 35:07.433
Hold him down.
Hold him down.

35:14.333 --> 35:16.966
You can begin now, warden.

35:17.033 --> 35:21.233
Wake up.
Andy...it's me, Bruno.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.700
You're in your cell.

35:30.366 --> 35:31.966
You're alive?

35:32.033 --> 35:34.133
It's time to go, Andy.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.433
We'll get out of here
under cover of darkness

35:36.500 --> 35:38.933
and get that money.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Lead the way, my man.

35:42.066 --> 35:44.633
- Well..
- Hey, what about the guards?

35:44.700 --> 35:46.400
I took care of them already.

35:46.466 --> 35:49.533
Just a little further
and we'll be home free.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.233
And you could show me
where the money is.

35:55.833 --> 35:59.066
How'd you say you got
ahold of that key?

35:59.133 --> 36:01.800
I found it
on the floor last week.

36:01.866 --> 36:03.800
Look, we're almost out, see.

36:03.866 --> 36:05.200
'That's the last security gate.'

36:05.266 --> 36:06.733
I thought you said
that you lifted it

36:06.800 --> 36:09.466
from one of the guards.

36:09.533 --> 36:13.600
Andy, quit snagging me
on the details.

36:13.666 --> 36:14.800
Well..

36:14.866 --> 36:18.400
Something weird
is going on here.

36:18.466 --> 36:21.100
Why isn't he responding
to my suggestions?

36:21.166 --> 36:23.100
I don't know.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.800
Look, Andy, we've made it.

36:37.733 --> 36:39.566
Where's the money?

36:39.633 --> 36:42.800
Are you kidding?
We're still in the corridor.

36:42.866 --> 36:45.433
And I'm not going nowhere
till I get some answers.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.233
Now, you listen to me,
you little smart ass.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.766
Easy, remember,
you're supposed to be Bruno.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.100
Take it easy.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.766
What's going on here?

36:53.833 --> 36:56.433
You're not giving
enough to..

36:56.500 --> 36:57.666
'That's too much.
You're gonna kill him!'

36:57.733 --> 36:59.833
No, that's too much!

37:06.300 --> 37:09.200
Tell me where the money is now.

37:09.266 --> 37:11.700
'Where'd you hide it?'

37:11.766 --> 37:13.600
Is this a trick?

37:13.666 --> 37:16.400
Andy, this is Bruno
you're talking to.

37:16.466 --> 37:17.733
You can trust me.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.933
Word to the mother.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.466
Well, the hell I will.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.000
'Bradycardia.'

37:26.066 --> 37:27.166
What the hell is happening?

37:27.233 --> 37:28.700
He's having a heart attack.

37:28.766 --> 37:30.600
Andy, listen to me.

37:30.666 --> 37:33.700
You're dying.
You can't take it with you.

37:33.766 --> 37:36.600
So tell me
where the money is, Andy.

37:36.666 --> 37:39.033
Maybe it'll get me into heaven.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.866
That's right. Maybe it will.

37:40.933 --> 37:43.500
So where's the money?

37:43.566 --> 37:45.533
Springwood Bank.

37:46.933 --> 37:49.000
Box 324.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.133
Flat line clear.

38:13.366 --> 38:15.000
He's dead.

38:23.966 --> 38:27.566
I took an oath swearing..

38:27.633 --> 38:31.000
...that I would
dedicate myself..

38:31.066 --> 38:35.200
...to preserving
the life of others.

38:37.966 --> 38:41.066
I just destroyed one.

38:41.133 --> 38:43.700
Will you get a grip?

38:43.766 --> 38:47.200
Caulfield killed two people.
Justice was served.

38:47.266 --> 38:50.033
No, the only thing you served
here was yourself.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.300
I want the rest
of the tapes, Douglas. Now

39:02.166 --> 39:04.100
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

39:06.233 --> 39:08.566
Also want a copy
of Caulfield's death certificate

39:08.633 --> 39:11.600
on my desk, the first thing
in the morning.

39:15.333 --> 39:18.033
Aren't you afraid
I'll go to the authorities

39:21.400 --> 39:24.366
You've got a family, doc.

39:24.433 --> 39:27.433
You live pretty well.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.300
You don't wanna throw
all that away, do you?

39:32.866 --> 39:35.600
You're just as guilty as I am.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.100
'I'm sure I can trust you.'

39:53.166 --> 39:55.133
'Good morning, Douglas.'

39:55.200 --> 39:58.700
What are you doing, dean?

39:58.766 --> 40:01.033
I couldn't sleep last night.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.866
I kept thinking
of how we left things

40:02.933 --> 40:06.000
and I decided that I was wrong.

40:06.066 --> 40:09.100
I can't trust you.

40:09.166 --> 40:11.266
Oh, hey, c-come on.
Now, don't do this.

40:11.333 --> 40:12.933
Dean!

40:13.000 --> 40:15.900
Forgive my sloppy techniques,
will you, Douglas?

40:15.966 --> 40:17.100
Uh, this is the first time

40:17.166 --> 40:19.700
I've ever been able
to use one of these on someone.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.133
Why?

40:21.200 --> 40:23.066
I can't afford
skeletons in my closet.

40:23.133 --> 40:25.433
You know too much.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.033
But you're the expert.

40:27.100 --> 40:29.566
How many volts does it take
to kill one instantly?

40:29.633 --> 40:31.733
Dean..

40:31.800 --> 40:34.133
Uh, I'll go for max.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.566
Dean, don't do this.
Dean, don't do..

40:43.500 --> 40:46.866
Oh, Douglas, I have great news.

40:46.933 --> 40:49.966
My campaign manager has arranged
for me this afternoon

40:50.033 --> 40:52.300
a live exclusive interview

40:52.366 --> 40:54.266
with the
"Springwood Confidential."

40:54.333 --> 40:56.600
That's to tell about
my finding the money.

40:56.666 --> 40:59.800
If this doesn't win me
the election, nothing will

40:59.866 --> 41:01.600
Congratulations.

41:01.666 --> 41:03.066
We're gonna do it right here
in the prison.

41:03.133 --> 41:04.233
I'd like you to be there.

41:04.300 --> 41:06.833
You know, kind of,
uh, show of support.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.066
Can I count
on your cooperation?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.633
Oh, sure. Yeah.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.900
By the way..

41:12.966 --> 41:16.633
...I saw Caulfield's
death certificate this morning.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.633
Nicely handled.

41:23.066 --> 41:26.966
- 'Aw, thanks, doc.'
- Oh, I am sorry. I'm sorry.

41:27.033 --> 41:29.100
Here, clean that.
I'll get you another glass.

41:32.166 --> 41:35.366
Okay, warden, we're on
live in 15 seconds

41:35.433 --> 41:37.366
so just relax and enjoy.

41:37.433 --> 41:39.033
Alright.

41:46.666 --> 41:49.100
Here you go. Okay.

41:49.166 --> 41:50.933
And you're on.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.800
I'm here with candidate
for sheriff

41:52.866 --> 41:54.333
Warden Dean Hendler.

41:54.400 --> 41:55.666
Welcome, warden.

41:55.733 --> 41:57.766
Pleased to be here, Monica.

41:57.833 --> 41:59.933
According to the polls
you're trailing

42:00.000 --> 42:03.100
very far behind
your opponent Sheila Reinfeld.

42:03.166 --> 42:05.033
Is there really any hope
of catching up

42:05.100 --> 42:06.266
this late in the game?

42:06.333 --> 42:08.800
Well, Monica, my opponent

42:08.866 --> 42:11.233
has run a negative campaign.

42:11.300 --> 42:15.033
It's full of insult
and innuendo.

42:15.100 --> 42:18.933
She implies that I'm easy
on crime, but she's wrong.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.066
My recent actions
bear that out.

42:22.133 --> 42:25.133
What actions are those?

42:25.200 --> 42:28.933
Well, I am proud
to announce that just today

42:29.000 --> 42:31.666
I uncovered five million dollars

42:31.733 --> 42:33.500
that was still missing

42:33.566 --> 42:37.300
from the infamous
1983 armored transport robbery.

42:37.366 --> 42:39.633
Really?
That's very impressive.

42:39.700 --> 42:42.200
'The police have been working
on that case for years'

42:42.266 --> 42:43.866
and haven't been able
to solve it.

42:43.933 --> 42:47.166
Uh...may I ask how you did it?

42:47.233 --> 42:48.400
Hmm.

42:50.666 --> 42:52.666
Hmm!

42:52.733 --> 42:56.633
The two of the prisoners
involved in the case

42:56.700 --> 43:00.533
were, uh, right here
at my prison.

43:00.600 --> 43:04.733
And, uh, we used advance, uh

43:04.800 --> 43:08.133
police interrogation techniques

43:08.200 --> 43:11.833
to, uh, pull the information

43:11.900 --> 43:15.100
'from...one of the prisoners.'

43:16.033 --> 43:18.266
Hi, warden.

43:18.333 --> 43:20.233
It's me..

43:21.066 --> 43:22.133
...Andy.

43:23.566 --> 43:24.900
Andy?

43:24.966 --> 43:27.833
Yeah. Surprised to see me?

43:27.900 --> 43:29.633
But you're dead.

43:30.833 --> 43:33.433
'Why do you say that?'

43:34.633 --> 43:37.433
The drug I gave you,
it killed you.

43:40.533 --> 43:44.033
'Well, now, you know
you liked me, warden.'

43:44.900 --> 43:47.600
You said it was a cancer drug.

43:47.666 --> 43:51.200
What was it really, warden?

43:51.266 --> 43:54.933
It was an experimental,
hallucinogenic truth serum

43:55.000 --> 43:57.600
Oh, why did you lie to me?

43:58.666 --> 44:00.900
I had to lie.

44:00.966 --> 44:04.866
I had to find out
where you kept that money

44:04.933 --> 44:07.766
so I can get elected.

44:07.833 --> 44:11.666
Let me make sure I understand
this correctly, warden.

44:11.733 --> 44:16.000
'You gave an untested drug
to one of your prisoners?'

44:16.633 --> 44:17.733
That's right.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.633
And it killed him.

44:19.700 --> 44:21.200
I mean, he was just
a common criminal.

44:21.266 --> 44:23.233
Who cares if he died.

44:23.300 --> 44:27.566
What matters
is I got the money back.

44:27.633 --> 44:31.200
So, now, you have
to elect me sheriff.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.133
There's somethin' for you, huh?

44:38.200 --> 44:41.333
A politician
finally tells the truth.

44:42.666 --> 44:45.533
They elected him sheriff
of Springwood anyway.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.733
My kinda town.
