WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.086
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>

00:03.169 --> 00:04.879
IS RECORDED IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.428
- WELL, THIS IS GREAT.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.887
WHO NEEDS A FANCY SALON?

00:12.971 --> 00:14.180
- I DO.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.140
AND AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE,

00:15.223 --> 00:17.267
I'M GOING OUT
FOR A MANI-PEDI.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.102
- YOU JUST FINISHED
DOING YOUR NAILS.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.937
- YES, SO THAT
THEY'D BE PRESENTABLE

00:21.020 --> 00:22.605
WHEN I GET THEM DONE
BY A PROFESSIONAL.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.149
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A COMMON COURTESY,

00:24.232 --> 00:27.277
LIKE CLEANING UP
BEFORE THE HOUSEKEEPER COMES.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.111
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.822
- I KNOW, HONEY.
I USED TO WAX YOU.

00:32.741 --> 00:36.077
- HAND ME THE HAIR COLOR.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.287
- THANKS.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.580
- HEY, NICE AND EASY.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.957
- YEAH,
I PICKED THIS UP YESTERDAY.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.294
- THAT'S GREAT, DEAR, BUT I WAS
TALKING TO MELANIE AND JOY.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.879
IF THAT IS JOY.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.259
AAH!

00:51.342 --> 00:53.636
WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS
DOING IN HERE?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.638
- WE'RE HAVING
A DAY OF BEAUTY.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.140
YOU KNOW,
FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.808
- WELL, LAY DOWN
YOUR WEAPONS, LADIES.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.103
TIME WON.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.313
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.608
MOVING TO CLEVELAND HAS EXTENDED
OUR SHELF LIFE BY 20 YEARS.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.067
- ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST,

01:08.151 --> 01:08.985
WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH

01:09.068 --> 01:10.987
A BIT OF A ROMANTIC
DRY SPELL LATELY,

01:11.070 --> 01:12.655
SO WE'VE DECIDED
TO UP OUR GAME.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.616
- WELL,
WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO?

01:14.699 --> 01:16.284
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THIS MUCH BODY WORK

01:16.367 --> 01:18.620
SINCE G.M. LEFT TOWN.

01:18.703 --> 01:21.122
- YOU'RE CRANKIER THAN USUAL.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.832
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.959
- YOU GUYS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.336
- IS IT BECAUSE
OF THE BROWNS?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.337
- NO.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.546
- OH, IS IT
BECAUSE OF YOUR TRIAL?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.215
- NO.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.966
- IS IT BECAUSE
YOU BROKE UP WITH MAX?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.301
- NO.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.136
IT'S BECAUSE MY MAX

01:35.220 --> 01:37.722
HAS ALREADY STARTED
DATING SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.518
AND THE BROWNS STINK.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.811
- I'M SO SORRY.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.813
- SO AM I.

01:44.896 --> 01:48.358
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK
FOR ONE DECENT WIDE RECEIVER?

01:50.443 --> 01:53.863
- ELKA, DON'T HIDE BEHIND
WHOEVER THE BROWNS ARE.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.032
- YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT MAX.

01:56.115 --> 01:57.200
WHO'S HE DATING NOW?

01:57.283 --> 01:59.828
- THAT SLUT
FROM THE SENIOR CENTER.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.831
AKA FAT-ASS HAGFORD.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.041
- SO MANY
COLORFUL NAMES FOR HER.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.919
FAT-ASS HAGFORD.
ANGUS FATFORD.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.045
I'VE FORGOTTEN HER REAL NAME.
WHAT IS IT AGAIN?

02:10.128 --> 02:12.757
- BITCH.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.761
- WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE EVER BROKEN UP WITH MAX

02:16.845 --> 02:18.054
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.222
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.267
- YES, BUT HIS SON
IS RUNNING FOR OFFICE,

02:22.350 --> 02:25.228
AND I'M TIED
TO A MAFIA CRIME.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.856
- HELLO!

02:27.939 --> 02:29.524
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLY
HANDSOME MAN

02:29.607 --> 02:32.235
TALKING ON HIS CELL PHONE
ON OUR PORCH.

02:32.318 --> 02:36.447
- [gasps]
HE'S LIKE SEX IN A SUIT.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.242
- IF HE'S A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS,
I'M CONVERTING.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.579
- IF HE'S A MORMON,
HE CAN HAVE ALL THREE OF US.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.788
- THAT MUST BE MY LAWYER.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.082
- I HAVE TO CHANGE.

02:46.165 --> 02:47.792
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
STOP.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.710
STOP, YOU GUYS.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.712
THIS IS CRAZY.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.589
WE SHOULD JUST GO UP
ONE AT A TIME.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.258
SHORTEST FIRST.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.929
- HEAVENS.
ALL THAT FUSS OVER ONE...

03:00.013 --> 03:01.389
- MRS. OSTROVSKY?

03:01.472 --> 03:05.101
- I HOPE YOU'RE MY LAWYER.

03:05.184 --> 03:09.856
BECAUSE I'M DEFENSELESS.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.116
{\an8}- WELL, ELKA,
I'VE BEEN REVIEWING YOUR CASE,

03:20.199 --> 03:21.326
{\an8}AND BASED ON WHAT I SEE HERE,
I HAVE--

03:21.409 --> 03:22.493
{\an8}- OH, I'M SORRY.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.496
{\an8}I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
WAS DOWN HERE.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.334
{\an8}[yawns]

03:29.417 --> 03:30.919
{\an8}I JUST WOKE UP.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.254
{\an8}I MUST LOOK A FRIGHT.

03:33.338 --> 03:37.467
{\an8}- I THINK YOU FORGOT THE REST
OF YOUR OUTFIT UPSTAIRS.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.637
{\an8}WITH YOUR DIGNITY.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.180
{\an8}- HI, I'M KIRK,
ELKA'S ATTORNEY.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.806
{\an8}- I'M JOY.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.934
{\an8}IS THERE
A MRS. ELKA'S ATTORNEY?

03:46.017 --> 03:47.977
{\an8}- NO, I GUESS I HAVEN'T MET
THE RIGHT WOMAN YET.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.648
{\an8}- [breathy voice]
HELLO.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.815
{\an8}- HI.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.026
{\an8}- I'M MELANIE.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.947
{\an8}- ARE YOU HAVING
AN ASTHMA ATTACK?

03:59.030 --> 04:00.531
{\an8}- NO.

04:00.615 --> 04:04.953
{\an8}YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES MY VOICE
GETS DEEP AND SENSUAL?

04:05.036 --> 04:07.497
{\an8}LIKE A YOUNG--
- LARRY KING?

04:12.043 --> 04:15.004
{\an8}- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HIRED A LAWYER YET,

04:15.088 --> 04:18.007
{\an8}OR THAT YOU WAKE UP
IN MAKEUP.

04:20.134 --> 04:24.681
{\an8}- KIRK WAS SENT TO ME
BY MY LATE HUSBAND'S...FRIENDS.

04:24.764 --> 04:25.682
{\an8}- OH.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.475
{\an8}- SO YOU WORK FOR THE MAFIA?

04:27.558 --> 04:29.560
{\an8}- WELL, TECHNICALLY,
MY GRANDFATHER DID,

04:29.644 --> 04:30.979
{\an8}BUT HE PUT ME
THROUGH LAW SCHOOL,

04:31.062 --> 04:32.814
{\an8}SO FROM TIME TO TIME
I HELP HIS ASSOCIATES OUT.

04:32.897 --> 04:36.234
{\an8}- I HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

04:36.317 --> 04:40.405
{\an8}OH, PLEASE--
PLEASE, DON'T GET UP.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.781
{\an8}- WHAT'S ALL THIS THEN?

04:41.864 --> 04:43.700
{\an8}- OH, IT'S JUST MY EMMY GOWN.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.702
{\an8}I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT <i> EMMY</i> MAGAZINE

04:45.785 --> 04:46.703
{\an8}WANTS TO DO A PIECE ON ME

04:46.786 --> 04:48.997
{\an8}BECAUSE OF MY EMMY WIN.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.289
{\an8}- BOY, IT MUST BE EXCITING

04:50.373 --> 04:51.749
{\an8}LIVING WITH
A FAMOUS ACTRESS, HMM?

04:51.833 --> 04:55.545
{\an8}- WAS THAT A PROPOSAL?

04:55.628 --> 04:57.922
{\an8}- CAN WE GET BACK
TO MY TRIAL?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.382
{\an8}- YEAH, ELKA,
I'M GONNA BE BLUNT.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.175
{\an8}THE STATE HAS
A VERY SOLID CASE AGAINST YOU.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.468
{\an8}- OH, NO.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.220
{\an8}- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE STOLE ANYTHING.

05:04.303 --> 05:06.681
{\an8}SHE WAS JUST IN POSSESSION
OF STOLEN GOODS.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.893
{\an8}- IS THERE ANYTHING SOMEONE AS
BROAD-SHOULDERED AS YOU CAN DO?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.228
{\an8}- WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE IS ONE TACTIC

05:12.311 --> 05:13.229
{\an8}THAT'S WORKED IN THE PAST.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.105
{\an8}UH, ARE YOU LADIES FAMILIAR

05:14.188 --> 05:15.898
{\an8}WITH THE VINNIE
"THE CHIN" GIGANTE CASE?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.900
{\an8}- OH, THE MOBSTER WHO WORE
THE BATHROBE TO COURT.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.862
{\an8}- RIGHT. TO SHOW THAT HE WASN'T
COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.072
{\an8}- SO YOU WANT ME
TO PRETEND TO BE SENILE?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.073
{\an8}- PRETEND?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.868
{\an8}[laughs]

05:26.951 --> 05:29.454
{\an8}I'M A BIT OF A SCAMP.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.706
{\an8}- LISTEN,
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.249
{\an8}- GOOD.
AND IT'D BE REALLY HELPFUL

05:33.332 --> 05:34.959
{\an8}IF EACH OF YOU COULD TESTIFY
TO THAT FACT.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.753
{\an8}- OH, ABSOLUTELY.
- NOW, YOU DO UNDERSTAND,

05:36.836 --> 05:37.920
{\an8}YOU'LL BE RISKING
A PERJURY CHARGE.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.547
{\an8}- OH, WELL, I DON'T CARE.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.090
{\an8}WE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP ELKA OUT OF JAIL.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.884
{\an8}- PERFECT. YOU'LL BE
REALLY GOOD ON THE STAND.

05:42.967 --> 05:43.885
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT A VERY HONEST FACE.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.970
{\an8}- I'LL HELP TOO.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.305
{\an8}- GREAT. WHO DOESN'T LOVE
A BRITISH ACCENT?

05:47.388 --> 05:49.891
{\an8}- OH, PERHAPS I SHOULD BE
THE STAR WITNESS.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.310
{\an8}SINCE I DO HAVE SOME
ACTING EXPERIENCE.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.730
{\an8}AND BY "SOME"
I MEAN "EMMY-WINNING."

05:55.813 --> 05:57.315
{\an8}- THEN HOW COULD THE JUDGE
NOT BE IMPRESSED?

05:57.398 --> 05:59.442
{\an8}SO I'LL GO DOWN NOW

05:59.525 --> 06:01.277
{\an8}AND FILE THE MOTION
FOR A COMPETENCY HEARING.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.779
{\an8}- COUNSELOR.
- COUNSELOR.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.948
{\an8}-<i> CONSIGLIERE.</i>

06:06.032 --> 06:08.284
{\an8}- I'LL WALK YOU TO THE DOOR.

06:08.367 --> 06:12.413
{\an8}IF I CAN REMEMBER
WHERE IT IS.

06:12.497 --> 06:16.375
{\an8}SEE, I'M WORKING IT ALREADY.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.210
{\an8}- IS IT JUST ME,

06:17.293 --> 06:19.837
{\an8}OR WERE YOU TWO
A LITTLE OVER THE TOP?

06:19.921 --> 06:21.422
{\an8}- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.301
{\an8}MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK
YOUR <i> CONSIGLIERE.</i>

06:25.384 --> 06:28.471
{\an8}- [breathy voice]
THANK YOU, MELANIE.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.140
{\an8}- OKAY, OBVIOUSLY
WE'RE ALL ATTRACTED TO HIM,

06:31.224 --> 06:33.309
{\an8}AND, PERHAPS HEIGHTENED
BY OUR RECENT DATELESS-NESS,

06:33.392 --> 06:35.144
{\an8}WE'RE ACTING A LITTLE INSANE.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.438
{\an8}WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.898
{\an8}WE'VE NEVER BEEN
IN THIS SITUATION BEFORE.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.316
{\an8}I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MARRIED,

06:40.399 --> 06:43.820
{\an8}AND VICTORIA WAS...
WELL, OFTEN MARRIED.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.029
{\an8}- AND I WAS ALWAYS SINGLE,

06:45.113 --> 06:46.322
{\an8}WHICH IS WHY
I SHOULD GET HIM.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.657
{\an8}- WELL, I'M SORRY.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.827
{\an8}IT'S NOT LIKE ME
TO BE SELF-CENTERED, BUT...

06:50.910 --> 06:52.328
{\an8}I COULD JUST REALLY USE

06:52.411 --> 06:54.831
{\an8}SOMETHING TO CHEER ME UP,
YOU KNOW?

06:54.914 --> 06:58.960
{\an8}LIKE HIM AND FADED LEVIS
AND NO SHIRT.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.837
{\an8}- ON A MOTORCYCLE,
NO HELMET,

07:00.920 --> 07:03.005
{\an8}BIT OF A SCRUFF.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.340
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE'S WEARING.

07:04.423 --> 07:08.469
{\an8}I COULD JUST PICTURE HIM
ON TOP OF ME.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.180
{\an8}- SURE COULD TAKE MY MIND
OFF MY DEPORTATION TROUBLES.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.683
- MM, AND MY BEING POOR.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.017
ALL RIGHT, MELANIE,
YOU DECIDE.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.144
WHO SHOULD GET HIM?
ME OR JOY?

07:16.227 --> 07:18.354
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

07:18.437 --> 07:19.522
WHY DON'T I
HAVE A SHOT AT HIM?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.732
- BECAUSE UP UNTIL
YOUR ONE-NIGHT STAND

07:21.816 --> 07:23.526
TURNED OUT TO BE
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S BROTHER,

07:23.609 --> 07:25.695
YOU HAD A SEX LIFE.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.364
- OKAY.

07:28.447 --> 07:29.657
WHICH ONE OF YOU
AM I GONNA GIVE HIM TO?

07:29.740 --> 07:31.534
- GIVE?

07:31.617 --> 07:33.870
- YOU HAVE TO HAVE
IN ORDER TO GIVE, DEAR.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.914
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANT TO BE MEAN,

07:36.998 --> 07:39.333
BUT HE WAS OBVIOUSLY
ATTRACTED TO ME.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.918
HE SAID I HAD
AN HONEST FACE.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.213
- WELL, SO DID ABE LINCOLN.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.174
YOU KNOW,
BUT IF WE'RE BEING HONEST,

07:46.257 --> 07:47.592
THEN, I MEAN,
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR

07:47.675 --> 07:50.386
THAT HE WAS BEWITCHED
BY MY STAR POWER.

07:50.469 --> 07:51.846
- OH, GIVE IT UP.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.347
HE WAS STARING AT MY LEGS

07:53.431 --> 07:56.350
THE WHOLE TIME HE WAS
COMPLIMENTING MY SEXY ACCENT.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.561
- SO WE'RE BACK
TO WHAT DO WE DO.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.314
NOW, NORMALLY I WOULD SAY
WE SHOULDN'T COMPETE OVER A MAN,

08:01.397 --> 08:04.859
BUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH A LITTLE
HEALTHY COMPETITION?

08:04.942 --> 08:06.194
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT

08:06.277 --> 08:07.778
BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA WIN.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.739
- NO, NO, I'M SAYING IT
'CAUSE I KNOW I'M GONNA WIN.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.743
- OH, YOU'RE BOTH SO WRONG,
BECAUSE I'M GONNA WIN.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.828
- SO WE'RE GONNA GO FOR THIS?

08:15.912 --> 08:16.913
- OH, IT'S ON.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.748
- OH, IT IS SO ON.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.875
- IT IS SO ON I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU BORROW MY CURLING IRON.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.251
- SERIOUSLY?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.419
- WELL, NO,
YOU CAN BORROW IT,

08:23.502 --> 08:25.755
BUT THEN IT IS SO ON.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.594
- OH, THANK YOU FOR MEETING ME
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.763
- WELL, YOU SOUNDED
SO URGENT ON THE PHONE.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.224
- WELL, I'M UP FOR A PART
PLAYING A SEXY LADY LAWYER

08:36.307 --> 08:38.934
IN THE NEW SHOW
CALLED <i> SEXY LADY LAWYERS.</i>

08:39.018 --> 08:40.770
- SO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A LAWYER?

08:40.852 --> 08:43.438
- WELL, I ALREADY KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE A SEXY LADY.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.986
- GREAT CHOICE.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.448
- THANKS.
THAT'S MY GLASS.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.408
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.952
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE COMING.

08:56.035 --> 08:56.953
- NOR I YOU.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.663
WELL, THIS IS GRAND.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.498
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE AT THE SUPERMARKET.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.624
- I ALREADY WENT.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.043
AND I PICKED UP THOSE
ODOR EATERS YOU ALWAYS NEED.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.589
- THANK YOU.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.632
BUT SINCE
YOU WERE ALREADY THERE

09:09.715 --> 09:11.592
GETTING YOUR MEDICATION
FOR YOUR TOENAIL FUNGUS,

09:11.676 --> 09:14.595
THEN WHY NOT?

09:14.679 --> 09:16.305
- WELL, IF YOU TWO NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FEET,

09:16.389 --> 09:17.390
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME.

09:17.473 --> 09:18.808
- NO, NO, NO.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.935
MELANIE TEXTED ME
THAT SHE'S WAXING THE FLOORS

09:21.018 --> 09:22.520
AND NOT TO COME HOME.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.021
- OH, WELL, SHE TEXTED ME
THE SAME THING,

09:24.105 --> 09:25.815
SO I THOUGHT I'D JUST
KILL A LITTLE TIME

09:25.898 --> 09:28.985
AND DO A LITTLE
ACTING RESEARCH.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.362
- OH, FOR THAT NEW MOVIE
YOU'RE DOING.

09:31.445 --> 09:37.034
BUT WHAT WOULD KIRK KNOW ABOUT
PLAYING A MENOPAUSAL WOMAN?

09:37.118 --> 09:40.204
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD HAVE COME TO YOU.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.834
SO, UM, WHY ARE YOU HERE
WITH KIRK, HMM?

09:44.917 --> 09:46.127
- WELL, HE WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO MEET ME

09:46.210 --> 09:47.795
TO DISCUSS
MY I.N.S. PROBLEMS.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.964
- I TOLD HER ON THE PHONE
I'M NOT AN IMMIGRATION LAWYER.

09:50.047 --> 09:50.840
- OH, YOU'RE SO MODEST.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.342
I TELL PEOPLE
I'M NOT KATE BECKINSALE,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.177
BUT THEY STILL TAKE PICTURES
OF ME AT THE AIRPORT.

09:55.261 --> 09:59.140
CLICK, CLICK.
"OH, STOP."

09:59.223 --> 10:03.185
- OH, IT'S SUCH A SHAME
YOU'RE BEING DEPORTED.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.186
[cell phone rings]

10:04.270 --> 10:06.480
- EXCUSE ME.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.691
HELLO?

10:08.774 --> 10:10.860
OH, HI, MELANIE.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.029
- MELANIE.
- HOW CHARMING.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.363
PUT HER ON SPEAKER.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.532
- I'D LOVE TO ASK YOU
SOME LEGAL QUESTIONS

10:16.615 --> 10:17.867
INVOLVING MY DIVORCE?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.535
- WELL, I'M NOT REALLY
A DIVORCE LAWYER.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.538
- OH, WELL, WE COULD JUST
TALK ABOUT THAT AT MY PLACE.

10:22.621 --> 10:26.083
MY ROOMMATES ARE OUT
AT A LESBIAN A.A. MEETING.

10:32.923 --> 10:33.841
I DON'T KNOW.

10:33.924 --> 10:34.884
I'M JUST KIND OF SCARED

10:34.967 --> 10:36.469
OF BEING ALONE
IN THIS BIG OLD HOUSE.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.220
- OH, PLEASE.
- VICTORIA, IS THAT YOU?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.555
- YES.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.057
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING TH--

10:41.140 --> 10:43.434
I MEAN, WHAT--WHY AREN'T YOU
AT YOUR MEETING?

10:43.517 --> 10:46.354
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT DRINKING.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.897
- SHE'S JOKING.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.857
SHE ALWAYS GETS IRRITABLE

10:49.940 --> 10:52.151
WHEN HER IRRITABLE BOWEL
FLARES UP.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.071
- LISTEN, IT'S GETTING LATE.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.198
WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS YOUR
LEGAL PROBLEMS AFTER DINNER?

10:57.281 --> 10:58.574
- SURE. WHICH ONE OF US
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE?

10:58.657 --> 11:00.743
- WELL, HOW ABOUT
ALL THREE OF YOU?

11:00.826 --> 11:03.371
women: YAY.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.128
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT ME AT DINNER LAST NIGHT.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.713
- WHAT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME?

11:12.797 --> 11:13.923
I MEAN,
I KNOW WE SAID IT WAS ON,

11:14.006 --> 11:15.925
BUT THAT WAS BEYOND ON.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.718
- FORTUNATELY
I STAYED ABOVE THE FRAY.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.095
- WHAT,
BY PRETENDING TO CHOKE

11:19.178 --> 11:20.930
SO THAT KIRK WOULD
PUT HIS ARMS AROUND YOU?

11:21.013 --> 11:23.724
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
AT NO POINT DURING THE HEIMLICH

11:23.808 --> 11:25.601
IS THE CHOKING VICTIM

11:25.684 --> 11:29.605
SUPPOSED TO GUIDE THE
RESCUER'S HANDS TO HER BOOBS.

11:29.688 --> 11:32.608
- THE IMPORTANT THING
IS I'M ALIVE.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.276
- WORST NIGHT EVER.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.278
- HEY, GIRLS.
THAT WAS FUN LAST NIGHT.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.322
- OH, SO MUCH FUN.
- I HAD THE BEST TIME.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.075
- I HAD AN EVEN
BETTER TIME, KIRK.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.660
- SO IS ELKA READY?

11:42.743 --> 11:44.120
IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR THE COMPETENCY HEARING.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.788
- SHE'S JUST FRESHENING UP.
- AH.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.666
- WHERE AM I?

11:48.749 --> 11:51.794
WHO AM I?

11:51.877 --> 11:54.130
LET'S DO THIS THING.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.674
OH, NO, IT'S MAX.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.259
AND HE'S WITH
HAGNES FATFORD.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.302
- OKAY, NOW, REMEMBER,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SENILE.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.804
THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE OUT HERE.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.722
- ELKA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:03.806 --> 12:06.308
- OH, MAX.
PEOPLE ARE STARING.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.310
JUST IGNORE HER.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.814
- WHY IS YOUR PIG
WEARING A DRESS?

12:11.897 --> 12:13.149
- WHAT?

12:13.232 --> 12:14.483
- PLEASE EXCUSE HER.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.360
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.862
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT,

12:17.945 --> 12:20.114
BUT BEFORE YOU HEAR
FROM ANYONE ELSE,

12:20.197 --> 12:21.866
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT--

12:21.949 --> 12:23.826
- WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.286
- WHAT?

12:25.369 --> 12:28.998
- [loudly]
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!

12:29.081 --> 12:30.499
- BUT...

12:30.583 --> 12:31.459
- SHE'S JUST CONFUSED.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.169
THIS HAS BEEN COMING ON
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.628
- MAX, TICK TOCK.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.130
THE JUDGE IS WAITING FOR US.

12:36.213 --> 12:39.175
THE WEDDING'S AT 2:00.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.011
- BE WELL, ELKA.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.221
- I CANNOT BELIEVE

12:44.305 --> 12:46.682
THAT YOU WERE EVER ENGAGED
TO THAT DREADFUL WOMAN.

12:46.765 --> 12:50.644
AAH!

12:50.728 --> 12:53.814
- THAT'S GREAT,
BUT SAVE IT FOR THE HEARING.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.734
- ELKA.
I'M SO SORRY.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.864
- HEY, I KNOW YOUR MIND
IS ON MAX,

13:01.947 --> 13:04.825
BUT REMEMBER, THIS COULD
KEEP YOU OUT OF PRISON.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.912
- THANK YOU, YOUR MAJESTY.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.875
[gavel pounds]

13:12.958 --> 13:14.668
- THIS IS A HEARING
TO DETERMINE

13:14.752 --> 13:16.504
IF THE DEFENDANT
IS COMPETENT

13:16.587 --> 13:19.423
TO STAND TRIAL
IN CASE NUMBER 10421,

13:19.507 --> 13:21.592

VERSUS ELKA OSTROVSKY.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.719
FOR THE DEFENSE, WE HAVE...

13:23.802 --> 13:26.514
THE VERY CAPABLE
KIRK STARK.

13:36.982 --> 13:37.900
- EVERY DAY, YOUR HONOR.

13:37.983 --> 13:42.530
- WHAT EXACTLY
DOES THAT ENTAIL?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.907
- OH, A LOT OF CRUNCHES,
SQUATS, STAIR WORK,

13:44.990 --> 13:46.909
THAT SORT OF THING.

13:46.992 --> 13:51.080
- THAT'S FASCINATING.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.082
WELL, I SUPPOSE
WE SHOULD CONTINUE.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.959
REPRESENTING THE STATE
IN THIS MATTER WE HAVE--

13:55.042 --> 13:55.960
- UH, GREG TRIMMER--

13:56.043 --> 13:57.878
- YEAH, I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
YOUR LIFE STORY.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.052
KIRK, DO YOU WANT TO CALL
YOUR FIRST WITNESS?

14:05.135 --> 14:06.053
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.096
AT THIS TIME,
THE DEFENSE

14:07.179 --> 14:10.975
WOULD LIKE TO CALL
VICTORIA CHASE TO THE STAND.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.268
OH, I'M SORRY.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.561
THE DEFENSE WOULD LIKE TO CALL

14:13.644 --> 14:15.688
TELEVISION'S VICTORIA CHASE
TO THE STAND.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.574
- PLEASE RAISE
YOUR RIGHT HAND.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.200
DO YOU SWEAR
TO TELL THE TRUTH,

14:28.284 --> 14:30.160
THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?

14:30.244 --> 14:32.454
- I DO.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.251
- NOW, MISS CHASE, COULD YOU
GIVE THE COURT AN EXAMPLE

14:37.334 --> 14:39.795
OF WHY YOU THINK THE DEFENDANT
IS INCAPABLE OF STANDING TRIAL?

14:39.878 --> 14:41.463
- FADE IN.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.306
- JUST GET TO THE EXAMPLE,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.146
- LAST WEEK
I WAS IN MY LIVING ROOM,

14:57.229 --> 15:00.024
CURLED UP AND KITTENISH...

15:00.107 --> 15:02.318
UM, READING
A PENETRATING ARTICLE

15:02.401 --> 15:04.320
IN <i> THE AMERICAN LAW JOURNAL.</i>

15:04.403 --> 15:06.822
I JUST LOVE ALL THINGS
PERTAINING TO LAW.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.162
ANYWAY, I SUDDENLY
NOTICED THAT ELKA

15:13.245 --> 15:14.788
HAD WANDERED
OUT INTO THE STREET.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.374
SHE WAS FRIGHTENED
AND CONFUSED, AND...

15:17.458 --> 15:18.792
WELL,
AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK,

15:18.876 --> 15:20.669
I RAN OUT TO SAVE HER.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.464
- AND WERE YOUR ROOMMATES
MELANIE AND JOY WITNESS TO THIS?

15:23.547 --> 15:27.885
- ACTUALLY, JOY
WAS WAY TOO DRUNK TO STAND.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.386
IT WAS 9:00 a.m.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.263
- NOT TRUE.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.723
- [pounds gavel]
ORDER IN THE COURT.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.351
- AND MELANIE WAS UPSTAIRS,
WAGING HER OWN BRAVE,

15:35.434 --> 15:40.356
BUT ULTIMATELY FUTILE BATTLE
AGAINST CELLULITE.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.857
- OBJECTION.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.692
- ONLY THE JUDGE
OR THE LAWYERS CAN OBJECT.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.402
- THAT'S RIGHT.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.614
YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR STUFF.

15:54.953 --> 15:59.500
- SO AS MUCH AS IT
BREAKS MY HEART TO SAY THIS,

15:59.583 --> 16:02.753
I REALLY DO THINK SHE'S NOT
COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.713
- WELL, THANK YOU, MISS MORETTI,
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.382
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
ANY TIME.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.550
I LIKE IT WHEN WE TALK.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.055
OH, I'D LIKE
TO CLEAR SOMETHING UP.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.683
ALTHOUGH I DO SYMPATHIZE
WITH THE 95% OF WOMEN

16:15.766 --> 16:17.518
WHO DO SUFFER FROM CELLULITE,

16:17.601 --> 16:20.270
I HAPPEN TO BE
ONE OF THE LUCKY 5%.

16:22.106 --> 16:26.568
- LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT THE
COURT HAS BEEN EQUALLY BLESSED.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.408
I DON'T HEAR TYPING.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.451
- AND SHE'S CLEARLY DELUSIONAL.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.746
SHE ALWAYS MISTAKES ME
FOR A HOOKER.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.499
WHEREAS MOST PEOPLE
MISTAKE ME FOR KATE BECKINSALE.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.879
- THAT'S PERJURY, YOUR HONOR.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.589
ASK HER TO NAME
THESE SO CALLED PEOPLE

16:47.673 --> 16:49.299
WHO THINK
SHE'S KATE BECKINSALE.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.551
- OH, STOP IT.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.594
I DIDN'T INTERRUPT
YOUR TESTI-LYING.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.888
- I DID NOT LIE ONCE.

16:54.972 --> 16:55.889
- YOU SO DID.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.266
YOU LIED, LIKE, TEN TIMES.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.976
EXCEPT ABOUT ELKA.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.310
'CAUSE SHE REALLY IS CRAZY.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.437
AND THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.646
I'LL EVEN SWEAR--

17:02.730 --> 17:04.106
- ENOUGH.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.984
THE ONLY CRAZY PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM ARE THESE THREE.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.319
PUT ME ON TRIAL.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.612
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO.

17:10.695 --> 17:11.613
- NO, NO, WAIT, ELKA.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.615
- ELKA.
- WAIT.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.782
- YOU CAN'T JUST WALK OUT.
[gavel pounds]

17:14.867 --> 17:18.412
- THE DEFENDANT IS CLEARLY
COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

17:18.494 --> 17:20.455
THIS COURT IS ADJOURNED.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.583
COUNCIL, I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU IN MY CHAMBERS.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.041
NO, NOT YOU.
SIT DOWN.

17:39.683 --> 17:42.102
- AND DO YOU,
MAXWELL SIDNEY MILLER,

17:42.186 --> 17:45.022
TAKE THIS WOMAN TO BE
YOUR LAWFUL WEDDED WIFE?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.024
- NOT ON MY WATCH.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.984
- ELKA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:49.067 --> 17:51.487
- SOMEBODY RESTRAIN
THAT CRAZY WOMAN.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.322
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM CRAZY.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.324
CRAZY FOR YOU, MAX.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.034
I NEVER
SHOULD HAVE LET YOU GO.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.496
- AND I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER LET YOU LET ME GO.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.998
- SO I'M JUST A REBOUND THING.

18:03.081 --> 18:05.876
- I'M SORRY, AGNES,
BUT I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.336
IT'S NOTHING YOU'VE DONE.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.880
BUT MY HEART
IS PROMISED TO ANOTHER.

18:09.963 --> 18:12.716
- WELL,
IF YOU CHOOSE HER OVER ME,

18:12.800 --> 18:14.843
YOU'RE AS CRAZY AS SHE IS.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.181
HE'S ALL YOURS,
HELLKA O'SLUTSKY.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.019
- IS YOUR HEART
REALLY PROMISED TO ME, MAX?

18:24.102 --> 18:26.313
- IT'S PROMISED
TO THE CLEVELAND CLINIC,

18:26.396 --> 18:28.565
BUT UNTIL THEN,
IT BEATS ONLY FOR YOU.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.984
- ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO MARRY YOU AGAIN?

18:31.068 --> 18:31.985
- YES!

18:32.069 --> 18:35.364
- THEN, YES, AGAIN.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.492
- SINCE WE'RE HERE,
COULD WE TIE THE KNOT NOW?

18:38.575 --> 18:42.246
- I'M NOT GONNA GET MARRIED
ALL CRAZY IN A BATHROBE,

18:42.329 --> 18:46.166
LOOKING LIKE JOY.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.709
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TO ME.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.419
BUT I'LL WAIT IF YOU WANT.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.046
BUT I'D LIKE TO REHEARSE

18:51.129 --> 18:55.050
JUST ONE LITTLE PART
OF OUR FUTURE WEDDING.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.886
MAY I KISS THE BRIDE NOW?

19:13.277 --> 19:14.736
- HEY, ELKA,
I THINK WE ALL WANT TO SAY

19:14.820 --> 19:17.197
THAT WE'RE VERY SORRY
THAT WE RUINED YOUR HEARING.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.616
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.076
I MIGHT GO TO JAIL,

19:21.159 --> 19:22.870
BUT I HAVE MY MAX BACK.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.622
- OH, THE CRAZY THINGS
WE DO FOR MEN.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.792
- OH, KIRK WAS JUST
SO HANDSOME AND...

19:28.876 --> 19:30.878
AND...

19:30.961 --> 19:32.254
WHAT ELSE WAS HE?

19:32.337 --> 19:35.257
- WELL, HE WASN'T
PARTICULARLY CLEVER.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.426
- OR ROMANTIC.
- OR INTERESTING.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.304
- OR, FACE IT, A GOOD LAWYER.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.139
- YEAH, BUT IF I GET
AN ALL-FEMALE JURY,

19:42.222 --> 19:46.101
I'VE GOT IT MADE.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.270
- YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
IT WASN'T EVEN ABOUT KIRK.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.939
I JUST WANTED TO FEEL
AS FABULOUS AS YOU GUYS.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.816
YES,
I GET JEALOUS SOMETIMES.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.818
- OF ME? THAT'S CRAZY.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.738
- I'LL SAY.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.617
- I'M JEALOUS OF YOU.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.410
YOU'RE SO SEXY AND ADORABLE.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.078
OF COURSE A GUY'S
GONNA GO FOR YOU.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.039
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M JEALOUS OF BOTH OF YOU.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.125
THOSE LEGS AND THAT SMILE,

20:10.208 --> 20:12.502
WHAT GUY WOULD CHOOSE ME?

20:12.586 --> 20:14.087
- OH, PLEASE,
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING.

20:14.171 --> 20:18.258
YOU ARE SO GLAMOROUS,
SO GORGEOUS...

20:18.342 --> 20:21.595
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.180
- YOU'RE ALL HOT.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.307
YOU'RE ALL FABULOUS.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.310
YOU'RE ALL ALONE.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.313
SEE YA, LOSERS.
I GOT A DATE.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.149
