WEBVTT

00:05.976 --> 00:07.671
Can I help you find something?

00:07.757 --> 00:10.002
Oh. Yes. I'm looking for something

00:10.060 --> 00:12.057
that would be good for an old English lady

00:12.119 --> 00:13.595
with giant tits.

00:14.337 --> 00:15.330
Oh.

00:15.399 --> 00:17.088
- Uh...
- I got you right over here.

00:17.905 --> 00:19.071
Thank you.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.673
Oh, that's perfect.

00:24.741 --> 00:26.801
Right. Just touch the fabric.

00:26.859 --> 00:28.046
No, I don't need to touch it.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.945
You can just, uh, put it in a bag.

00:30.001 --> 00:32.247
Oh. Got it.

00:32.357 --> 00:33.582
Ooh.

00:33.650 --> 00:36.117
Why are you buying your
mother a bathing suit?

00:36.186 --> 00:39.897
Because I'm taking her to
Santa Barbara for the weekend.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.863
Oh, my God.

00:41.965 --> 00:42.792
Yeah.

00:42.863 --> 00:46.194
Mom, what do you want for
your birthday next week?

00:47.390 --> 00:49.179
I just want you, darling.

00:49.609 --> 00:51.766
We're going to do activities together.

00:51.835 --> 00:54.836
I'm taking her to all her favorite places.

00:54.905 --> 00:56.984
It's just going to be the two of us.

00:57.035 --> 00:58.859
Wow. That is...

00:58.948 --> 01:02.639
Yeah. I'm actually really
looking forward to it.

01:02.725 --> 01:04.983
I mean, I think one of the
reasons I hate her so much

01:05.066 --> 01:07.883
is that she's in my life every day.

01:07.952 --> 01:09.351
I think this is good.

01:09.471 --> 01:10.808
What are the girls going to do?

01:11.755 --> 01:15.360
Don't you want Mom and
Gran to have a special time?

01:15.428 --> 01:18.302
I want me to have a special time.

01:21.765 --> 01:24.690
It would be nice if somebody helped me.

Thanks, guys.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.184
Hello!

01:39.247 --> 01:42.074
- Hi, Phyl.
- I'm so excited.

01:42.121 --> 01:44.775
I tried the suit on. It's perfect.

01:44.847 --> 01:46.569
Really? I'm glad.

01:46.618 --> 01:48.256
- Okay, I got it.
- I got it.

01:48.327 --> 01:50.558
Couldn't you just let
me... Just let me get it.

01:50.627 --> 01:51.878
- Your hand...
- I'm doing it.

01:51.956 --> 01:53.728
No, but now you've got the wheels down...

01:53.797 --> 01:54.711
- Can you j...
- I'm doing it.

01:54.774 --> 01:56.811
Can you let go for one second?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.434
Thank you.

02:00.804 --> 02:01.736
Okay.

02:07.554 --> 02:08.919
- Okay.
- Ah.

02:10.592 --> 02:12.347
It will be so good

02:12.382 --> 02:15.598
to get out of Los Angeles just for a day.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.897
- Yep.
- And to be together.

02:17.975 --> 02:19.421
- Oh, and by the way...
- Mm-hmm?

02:19.489 --> 02:21.640
I cut out some articles in the newspaper

02:21.675 --> 02:22.891
and put them together for you.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.685
I'll give them to you at the hotel.

02:26.186 --> 02:28.029
Okay.

02:28.589 --> 02:30.656
Yay.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.557
You all right?

02:40.840 --> 02:42.373
Ohh.

02:45.105 --> 02:46.281
Mom,

02:47.185 --> 02:49.386
I can't do this.

02:52.007 --> 02:53.540
I think I...

02:55.188 --> 02:57.708
I'm sorry. I could get you,
like, a bag or something.

02:57.787 --> 03:00.628
I just think I've passed the point

03:00.759 --> 03:03.894
where I could do this with you.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.272
It's all right, dear.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.014
I'll see you later.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.470
Shit.

04:04.021 --> 04:06.620
Oh, well, I suck.

04:06.655 --> 04:08.545
I suck as a daughter.

04:08.673 --> 04:10.848
I suck as a mom.

04:45.301 --> 04:47.468
Good morning, baby.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.437
Good morning, Mama.

04:49.506 --> 04:52.291
No offense, but in my dream you died.

04:52.401 --> 04:54.375
Oh. Wow.

04:54.444 --> 04:58.679
Well, I heard that dying things in dreams

04:58.748 --> 05:03.402
really means, like, rebirth
or renewal or change,

05:03.504 --> 05:07.898
something cool is going to
happen, so that's okay for me, huh?

05:07.991 --> 05:10.782
No. It's not okay, Mama.

05:10.876 --> 05:13.350
Yes, baby, it's okay.

05:13.428 --> 05:16.720
No, it's not because it was really scary

05:16.767 --> 05:20.492
and there's bears in it
and there was a windmill.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.929
Oh. I'm sorry, Mush.

05:23.999 --> 05:27.830
But listen, I'm here, you're here.

05:27.932 --> 05:33.205
We're all okay, so let's
get ready for schoolie.

05:36.095 --> 05:38.152
My throat hurts.

05:38.221 --> 05:40.904
Duke, seriously? Come on.

05:40.990 --> 05:43.716
I want to go to school, I really do,

05:43.809 --> 05:47.380
but I just... I just
don't know. I feel cold.

05:48.948 --> 05:50.880
Serious?

05:50.950 --> 05:52.223
Oh.

05:52.332 --> 05:54.569
Okay.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.604
All right.

05:56.909 --> 05:58.956
Go back to sleep if you can.

05:59.042 --> 06:02.588
Stay in bed until I get your
sisters ready and to school,

06:02.651 --> 06:04.859
and if you wake up, no
texting, no internet,

06:04.913 --> 06:06.866
no "Pretty Little Liars."

06:06.901 --> 06:09.936
Just rest or reading if anything, okay?

06:10.022 --> 06:11.406
Okay.

06:11.492 --> 06:12.702
All right.

06:12.796 --> 06:14.878
Stay cozy, Ferris Bueller.

06:24.464 --> 06:28.243
_

06:31.854 --> 06:35.679
_

06:40.154 --> 06:42.408
Mom, I need a dress from the 1940s.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.120
What? Now? Now you ask?

06:45.182 --> 06:46.597
Yeah, Mom. Jesus, Mom.

06:46.644 --> 06:48.554
I told you about this, like, weeks ago.

06:50.803 --> 06:55.047
No, you didn't. Jesus yourself,
no-notice-giving little shit.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.533
Max, do you have a dress
from, like, the 1940s

06:58.609 --> 06:59.867
- or something for Frankie?
- Jesus.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.855
Mom, she already went
into my room without asking

07:01.910 --> 07:05.141
and threw everything around in my closet!

07:05.219 --> 07:07.294
Oh, God, is that my shirt?

07:07.364 --> 07:10.368
Shut up, Max. You're such a bitch.

07:10.403 --> 07:15.703
Frankie, don't go in her closet without
asking, and don't curse. I hate it.

07:15.765 --> 07:17.802
We learned it from you, Mom.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.671
What? I'm defending you.

07:20.910 --> 07:22.890
Actually, Mom, we're fine.
Just don't get involved.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.225
This is between sisters.

07:24.294 --> 07:26.802
Good morning. It's Tuesday.

07:26.872 --> 07:28.225
Oh, sorry I'm late.

07:28.296 --> 07:29.533
Hi, Esperanza.

07:29.611 --> 07:33.071
Do you where my black, high-waisted,
skinny American Apparel jeans are?

07:33.106 --> 07:34.690
Oh, they're in the
laundry. I get them for you.

07:34.725 --> 07:37.171
Okay, thanks.

07:39.144 --> 07:41.189
Wait. What's the matter? Are you okay?

07:41.224 --> 07:42.912
Oh, yes. I'm okay.

07:42.966 --> 07:45.759
I got sick. I think it was food poisoning.

07:45.794 --> 07:48.451
I hurt my leg. I was throwing up all night.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.929
What? Oh, my God. Why did you come?

07:50.991 --> 07:52.714
You should have called me.

07:52.793 --> 07:54.821
No. It's okay. I'm okay.

07:54.884 --> 07:56.641
I get the pants. Eh.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.810
- Frankie. Frankie.
- What?

07:58.864 --> 08:01.011
Don't get too close to her. She's sick.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.887
Mom, calm down. She said
it was just food poisoning.

08:03.922 --> 08:06.635
Hi. Remember I was coming today?

08:06.690 --> 08:07.599
I got the bills and the checks.

08:07.634 --> 08:09.832
- Hi, Rey.
- Hi, Rey.

08:09.918 --> 08:11.463
Duke, go back to bed.

08:11.526 --> 08:13.891
What? She's not going to school?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.602
Jesus, Mom. I can't believe you.

08:16.688 --> 08:18.742
Yeah, Mom. That's really bad parenting.

08:18.828 --> 08:22.399
I got the pants, Frankie, my princess.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.216
Oh, thank you so much, Espie.

08:24.309 --> 08:27.872
No. No. Frankie, don't
kiss her. She's sick.

08:27.940 --> 08:32.135
Esperanza, feel better.
Thank you. I'll just...

08:32.221 --> 08:35.111
I'll do the lunches and grab cereal cups.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.607
Okay. Okay. <i>Nos vemos.</i>

08:38.717 --> 08:40.700
- Hi, Rey.
- Hi.

08:40.763 --> 08:42.813
I'll be with you in, like, one minute.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.332
I got to make the lunches, okay?

08:45.379 --> 08:48.674
Is there anything I can do? I could...
I could throw something together for you.

08:48.760 --> 08:49.895
- What?
- Yeah.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.339
You're so sweet.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.929
Okay, really, thank you.

08:54.007 --> 08:55.229
Okay, there's the bags.

08:55.302 --> 08:58.069
Here's the fruit, cereal, things, these.

08:58.159 --> 08:59.587
There's bars in the drawer.

08:59.658 --> 09:01.546
And I'm gonna...

09:01.609 --> 09:03.370
Mom, I want to make my own lunch.

09:03.405 --> 09:06.043
Frankie, stop with the
mishegoss! Get ready for school.

09:06.118 --> 09:07.425
I'll be right back, okay, Rey?

09:07.538 --> 09:08.404
Okay.

09:20.496 --> 09:21.769
Hey, Mom, are you in there?

09:21.833 --> 09:22.932
No!

09:28.363 --> 09:29.772
Okay.

09:29.889 --> 09:31.429
All right, so I threw
some lunch bags together,

09:31.514 --> 09:33.606
and papers right there
ready for you to sign.

09:33.682 --> 09:36.659
Okay. Thank you and not thank you.

09:43.492 --> 09:46.183
Why do you have a check for my dad?

09:46.252 --> 09:48.358
Oh, are all those checks for my dad?

09:50.107 --> 09:51.999
Want me to help you with your lunch?

09:52.092 --> 09:52.726
What do you want?

09:52.794 --> 09:55.361
Okay, but first I got
to show you this vine.

09:55.407 --> 09:57.677
- Let me find it.
- All right, let's see.

09:57.796 --> 09:58.695
Here.

10:00.102 --> 10:01.271
Ha ha ha ha!

10:01.394 --> 10:03.427
That's what's up. That's crazy.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.087
What's wrong with her?

10:05.157 --> 10:06.837
A lot.

10:06.931 --> 10:08.130
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey.

10:08.199 --> 10:11.005
You and Max need a ride to
school? I got my mom's Volvo back.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.826
- Hi, Maxie.
- Hey.

10:12.895 --> 10:13.805
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.163
- Here's a hug.
- I love you.

10:16.232 --> 10:18.802
Oh, my God. We almost completely made out.

10:18.888 --> 10:21.120
Hi. Do you guys want breakfast?

10:21.162 --> 10:23.381
I have cereal cups and,
like, breakfasty things.

10:23.431 --> 10:24.564
I could make you guys smoothies.

10:26.857 --> 10:27.633
Is he okay? Okay.

10:27.711 --> 10:30.177
- Hello!
- Hi, Pepper.

10:30.246 --> 10:31.603
What are you doing here?

10:31.638 --> 10:33.847
Yay. You guys are still here.

10:33.916 --> 10:35.476
Pepper wanted to pick Duke up.

10:35.539 --> 10:38.270
- That's amazing.
- Hi! Oh, my God!

10:38.344 --> 10:40.703
Get dressed! Hurry! It's spirit day!

10:40.790 --> 10:42.380
- I know! Yes!
- Now she's fine.

10:42.415 --> 10:44.641
We just stopped by from Oregon.
She wanted to see her so bad,

10:44.676 --> 10:46.960
- so I told her we could...
- That's fantastic.

10:47.029 --> 10:48.378
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:48.456 --> 10:50.297
Oh, this is Rey. This is Elizabeth.

10:50.366 --> 10:52.099
- Hi.
- Duke, guess what.

10:52.134 --> 10:54.201
- What?
- Rey made you a lunch.

10:54.270 --> 10:56.336
Thank you! Thank you!

10:56.405 --> 10:57.881
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

10:57.916 --> 11:00.226
Feel better. I mean... ha!

11:00.335 --> 11:02.109
- Bye, Sam.
- Bye, Pepper.

11:02.178 --> 11:04.111
Bye. See you guys.

11:04.180 --> 11:05.279
Ohh.

11:05.347 --> 11:06.914
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:06.982 --> 11:08.559
Nice recovery. It's such a miracle.

11:08.622 --> 11:10.704
- Bye, faker.
- You're so mean.

11:10.775 --> 11:12.590
- You're going to need a smog check.
- Oh, God.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.208
I'll come by next week
if you need some help.

11:14.243 --> 11:15.543
- Oh, I appreciate it.
- See you.

11:15.582 --> 11:17.319
Hey, you guys, sun block!

11:17.381 --> 11:18.392
Thanks, Olivier!

11:20.426 --> 11:21.792
<i>Bisou!</i>

12:00.554 --> 12:02.447
<i>And what should I do with my hand?</i>

12:05.608 --> 12:08.787
What do you think you
should do with your hand?

12:08.849 --> 12:12.622
<i>I need you to tell me.
Oh, God, I'm so hard.</i>

12:13.532 --> 12:14.531
Well...

12:16.599 --> 12:20.243
you should unbuckle your
belt and pull your pants down

12:20.345 --> 12:22.742
and get some air on it.

12:22.828 --> 12:24.038
<i>Yeah?</i>

12:24.103 --> 12:26.912
<i>Oh, God. Oh, please, Jesus.</i>

12:30.598 --> 12:32.721
Ohh.

12:32.756 --> 12:36.205
Oh, Jesus Christ!

12:36.274 --> 12:37.407
<i>Are you okay?</i>

12:39.955 --> 12:41.977
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:42.049 --> 12:44.749
<i>Can you stay on the phone with
me? I'm about to turn the corner.</i>

12:44.784 --> 12:46.421
<i>Stay with me, Sam.</i>

12:47.423 --> 12:51.292
- <i>Sam, please.</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

12:51.361 --> 12:53.695
Oh, hang on. Frankie's school is calling.

12:53.763 --> 12:54.862
<i>Oh, God. Come right b...</i>

12:56.414 --> 12:57.186
Hello.

12:57.253 --> 12:58.917
<i>Sam, it's Patti from school.</i>

12:58.952 --> 13:01.308
- What's wrong?
- <i>Frankie is fine. Don't worry.</i>

13:01.343 --> 13:02.813
<i>But I need you to come pick her up.</i>

13:02.848 --> 13:04.081
Pick her up? Why?

13:04.149 --> 13:06.004
<i>Well, we had a bit of a situation,</i>

13:06.106 --> 13:09.495
<i>but I'd like to talk to you about it when
you get to school. Can I see you soon?</i>

13:09.581 --> 13:14.460
Uh, I could be there in maybe 45 minutes.

13:14.562 --> 13:16.893
<i>All right, perfect.
I'll see you soon.</i>

13:17.415 --> 13:18.648
Okay.

13:20.719 --> 13:22.465
Hi. Did you?

13:22.566 --> 13:23.563
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:23.661 --> 13:25.861
- Okay. You're welcome. Bye.
- <i>I love you...</i>

13:29.322 --> 13:31.523
Oh, geez, there then Edith.

13:33.057 --> 13:34.628
So that's all.

13:34.713 --> 13:37.781
We have to have gender lines
when it comes to the bathrooms.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.349
It's Unified policy.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.051
Even though the world has changed,

13:41.119 --> 13:44.321
we can't have unisex
bathrooms in middle school.

13:44.389 --> 13:47.973
Yeah, but the thing is I
don't want a unisex bathroom.

13:48.008 --> 13:49.808
I just want to use the boys' room.

13:52.871 --> 13:55.362
What? Mom, no, you don't understand.

13:56.374 --> 13:57.307
What?

13:58.337 --> 13:59.704
Can I just go back to class?

13:59.775 --> 14:00.934
I'm sorry, darling.

14:00.969 --> 14:03.206
You have to go home now
for the rest of the day.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.743
What?

14:06.812 --> 14:09.946
It's just that I have things I do, Frankie,

14:10.015 --> 14:13.583
and now I've got to take
you home. It's a bummer.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.018
Sorry, Patti.

14:17.589 --> 14:19.089
Jesus, Mom.

14:19.157 --> 14:22.425
Tell Patti you're sorry
so I can take you home

14:22.494 --> 14:25.462
and try to salvage what is left of my day.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.299
Okay. Fine.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.637
I'm sorry, Patti.

14:34.706 --> 14:35.772
But I'm not.

14:35.841 --> 14:37.589
I know.

14:37.646 --> 14:39.141
We'll get 'em tomorrow.

14:41.913 --> 14:43.842
Have a good day.

14:43.928 --> 14:45.679
Don't forget to bring your homework.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.156
Thanks, Patti.

14:49.191 --> 14:50.624
No worries.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.056
Shit.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.809
Tell them I'm sorry.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.228
Thank you, Blair. Sorry.

15:00.736 --> 15:02.023
Mom.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.066
Mommy.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.201
Mom. Mom.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.270
Sam. Sam.

15:07.380 --> 15:09.339
Lois. Lois.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.508
Sam. Mom.

15:11.576 --> 15:13.777
Mommy. Mom.

15:15.847 --> 15:18.615
Okay, Mom, I know what you're
thinking, but you're wrong.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.786
Frankie, what do you think I do all day?

15:22.854 --> 15:25.455
Isn't it reasonable for me to expect

15:25.524 --> 15:29.125
that once you go to school you
won't need me again until 3:00?

15:29.194 --> 15:31.361
This is a huge bummer.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.931
It's not because I want to be a boy.

15:40.001 --> 15:41.514
I... I know that's what people are saying,

15:41.576 --> 15:43.606
like "Oh, it's Frankie,

15:43.675 --> 15:47.243
oh, obviously she's identifying
as a boy, blah blah blah."

15:47.298 --> 15:49.979
Ew, Mom, no, that's not the reason,

15:50.048 --> 15:51.915
What are you talking about?

15:55.720 --> 15:57.287
I don't like the girls' room.

15:57.355 --> 15:59.889
You don't like the girls' room.

15:59.958 --> 16:02.258
That's why I use the boys' room.

16:05.530 --> 16:08.064
The girls are disgusting. Do
you want to know what happened?

16:08.133 --> 16:10.800
Is there a mustache in Mexico?

16:10.869 --> 16:13.803
So Hadley was lying on
the bench in the bathroom,

16:13.872 --> 16:17.040
and Tamsen and Missy
are wearing these, like,

16:17.109 --> 16:20.543
one-piece, like, space suits,

16:20.612 --> 16:23.586
the onesies that, like, have a zipper
going all the way down to their crotches,

16:23.641 --> 16:27.050
and they kept, like, unzipping them
and showing their boobs to each other.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.839
Oh. That's normal.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.158
That sounds like middle school.

16:30.260 --> 16:32.343
You should hear the shit that
Auntie Sunny went through.

16:32.413 --> 16:33.981
No, Mom, that's... that's not all.

16:34.069 --> 16:35.268
Just let me finish.

16:36.461 --> 16:37.994
And so Missy

16:38.063 --> 16:40.230
stuck her finger in her...

16:42.534 --> 16:45.481
she stuck her finger up her pussy
and wiped it on Hadley's face.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.801
What?

16:48.895 --> 16:51.142
I know, Mom. It was so nasty.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.977
It was so, so, so, so gross.

16:54.045 --> 16:55.830
So did they get sent home, too?

16:55.916 --> 16:57.851
I didn't see them in Patti's office.

16:57.906 --> 17:00.335
No, Mom, they weren't
caught in the boys' room.

17:00.421 --> 17:03.295
I was. I'm the one who did the crime.

17:03.365 --> 17:06.885
Middle school girls are fucking disgusting.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.126
Bitches. Bitches. Ucch.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.332
Also, I can't believe

17:14.367 --> 17:17.335
you just said "stuck her
finger in her pussy" to me.

17:17.386 --> 17:19.252
I'm a little stunned.

17:29.899 --> 17:31.799
- Hi.
- Samuel.

17:31.868 --> 17:34.862
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

17:34.909 --> 17:37.205
Oh, man, my back.

17:37.273 --> 17:40.875
My back, killing me.

17:40.944 --> 17:44.345
And I have, like, these
cluster headache things.

17:44.414 --> 17:45.665
- What?
- I know, right?

17:45.700 --> 17:47.077
Really? It sounds bad.

17:47.140 --> 17:48.331
You look good, though.

17:48.418 --> 17:49.851
Yeah, Dorian Gray.

17:49.919 --> 17:51.258
Picture of you in the attic.

17:51.293 --> 17:53.321
- Oh, this old thing?
- Mm-hmm.

17:53.390 --> 17:56.324
Have you... What did you... Did
you do something to your lips?

17:56.393 --> 17:57.992
- No.
- No?

17:58.061 --> 18:00.495
A little Bo? A little rush do?

18:00.563 --> 18:04.799
Well, I did get some oxygen blown
into my face about two months ago.

18:04.853 --> 18:06.434
Fair enough. That'll be it.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.102
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and it shows.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.170
It's showing.

18:09.239 --> 18:12.006
- It is?
- I was just saying it's showing.

18:12.075 --> 18:14.282
Yes. My head actually is bad.

18:14.317 --> 18:16.836
Do you have, like, even
Advil at this point?

18:16.871 --> 18:19.681
Oh. Uh, yeah. Look in here.

18:19.749 --> 18:21.282
- Ooh.
- Probably in there.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.817
Cupboard of treats.

18:22.886 --> 18:24.082
Hey, Auntie Macy.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.182
Who is this child?

18:26.260 --> 18:28.056
Ooh!

18:30.193 --> 18:32.462
Oh, my goodness, duckie, you look gorgeous.

18:32.525 --> 18:34.306
Are you ready

18:34.368 --> 18:36.154
for your belated birthday present?

18:36.189 --> 18:37.554
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yes, yes. Yes.

18:37.593 --> 18:39.267
Okay, right. Oops.

18:39.302 --> 18:41.736
I'm breaking plates. Hold, please.

18:41.805 --> 18:43.322
Ta!

18:43.400 --> 18:45.000
Thank you, Auntie Macy!

18:45.976 --> 18:47.542
Love ya.

18:47.611 --> 18:49.477
Mommy, I'm almost done with my homework.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.245
Can I take a break and watch my show?

18:51.314 --> 18:52.480
Sure.

18:54.084 --> 18:55.617
Oi. What are...

18:55.685 --> 18:57.218
Mm.

18:57.287 --> 18:59.520
Hey, what are these? You use these?

18:59.589 --> 19:01.656
I don't know. What even is that?

19:02.959 --> 19:04.587
- What does it say?
- These.

19:05.762 --> 19:07.295
"Hydrocodone."

19:07.364 --> 19:08.363
Yeah. Vicodin.

19:08.431 --> 19:09.731
Yeah.

19:09.799 --> 19:12.200
I don't even know what that is.

19:12.268 --> 19:13.501
When is it from?

19:13.570 --> 19:14.869
Uh...

19:14.938 --> 19:17.005
Feb 2007.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.141
Uh. That's from when Duke was born.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.777
Hey, I feel it might be good for my neck.

19:22.846 --> 19:24.379
Well, aren't they expired?

19:24.447 --> 19:26.547
Mm-hmm, but it's fine to me.

19:26.616 --> 19:28.016
- Really?
- Hmm.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.651
Go for it. I don't...

19:29.719 --> 19:30.618
Thanks.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.023
So how are you besides your...

19:35.091 --> 19:37.759
clusters and flusters and...

19:37.827 --> 19:39.827
Musters. Yeah. No, I mean, good.

19:39.896 --> 19:42.397
I mean, Tank is, like,
obviously working the whole time,

19:42.465 --> 19:44.032
and he's never here I never see him,

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
which is fine because
he's annoying and prissy.

19:46.169 --> 19:47.735
Totally fine. What about you?

19:47.804 --> 19:49.203
How are my girls?

19:49.272 --> 19:51.906
Oh... they're good.

19:51.975 --> 19:53.808
I don't know how you do it.

19:53.877 --> 19:55.777
I really don't. I mean,
what with your girls

19:55.845 --> 19:59.013
and working and everything else.

20:00.850 --> 20:03.117
I, uh, I don't, actually.

20:03.186 --> 20:05.820
Everybody always gets a little bit screwed.

20:05.889 --> 20:09.524
Even when I do my best,
it ain't never enough.

20:09.592 --> 20:11.359
Oh, hon.

20:11.428 --> 20:14.829
Hey, what can I do? Let me do something,

20:14.898 --> 20:17.098
like, let me do something to help, please?

20:17.167 --> 20:18.666
Because, I mean, what do I do ever?

20:18.735 --> 20:19.901
- Seriously?
- I never do anything.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.869
Seriously. Just take me up on it.

20:21.938 --> 20:23.371
- Anything.
- Okay.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.606
How about soccer?

20:25.675 --> 20:27.809
You want to come to soccer on Saturday?

20:27.877 --> 20:30.311
Two of the girls have games
at the same frickin' time.

20:30.380 --> 20:32.080
It happens every weekend.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.048
Yeah, sure. What time is it?

20:34.117 --> 20:35.316
Noon.

20:35.385 --> 20:37.819
Uh, yeah, uh, I think I need to check...

20:37.887 --> 20:39.654
Honey, it's fine. It's okay.

20:39.723 --> 20:40.955
Thank you for asking, though.

20:41.024 --> 20:43.024
Anything. I will do anything for you.

20:43.093 --> 20:44.058
- You know that.
- I know.

20:44.127 --> 20:46.094
Do you have, uh, diet soda

20:46.162 --> 20:47.762
or something that I can take these with?

20:47.831 --> 20:49.397
No. I have iced tea.

20:49.466 --> 20:52.433
Ech. So I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna get to class,

20:52.502 --> 20:55.837
and I'll take them...
uhh... when I get there.

20:55.905 --> 20:56.804
- Okay.
- It's fine.

20:56.873 --> 20:58.439
Thank you. Bye!

20:58.508 --> 21:00.442
Okay, thanks for Duke's present.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.343
No worries.

21:02.412 --> 21:04.699
What time are we leaving? Do I have to go?

21:04.738 --> 21:06.942
In an hour, and yes.

21:09.619 --> 21:12.820
Hey, Mom, what happened
with Frankie at school today?

21:12.889 --> 21:14.822
What? Why?

21:14.891 --> 21:17.225
Because people are talking about it.

21:17.293 --> 21:19.560
What people?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.802
Oh. That's not people.

21:27.871 --> 21:30.088
Anyway, she got caught
using the boys' room.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.739
I guess it's happened before.

21:31.808 --> 21:34.744
She's just weirded out by
the middle school girls.

21:34.812 --> 21:36.095
She'll get over it.

21:37.529 --> 21:38.461
Mom.

21:39.347 --> 21:40.213
What?

21:43.686 --> 21:45.153
Mom, come on.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.822
Come on what?

21:48.453 --> 21:49.785
Max.

21:50.994 --> 21:53.094
Mom, Frankie is a boy.

21:53.967 --> 21:55.366
Uh...

21:56.931 --> 21:58.303
No. No.

21:58.350 --> 22:01.237
She was saying that everybody
was going to say that.

22:06.536 --> 22:08.719
- Mom...
- Max.

22:10.878 --> 22:11.911
