if I have anything...

12:33.990 --> 12:37.440
Oh, what happened to
the Purrpetual Pet
I got you for your birthday?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.100
It'’s okay.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.140
I was just looking.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.660
[breathes deeply]

12:47.450 --> 12:50.490
I know it doesn'’t
look like much
right now, but, um,

12:51.590 --> 12:54.320
we will make it feel
cozy somehow. I promise.

12:58.840 --> 12:59.840
There.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.270
Look...

13:13.340 --> 13:17.240
I know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.560
I just want you to know
I'’m gonna do everything I can

13:19.760 --> 13:21.760
to make this place
feel like home.

13:22.730 --> 13:25.660
And, um, if you need anything,

13:26.900 --> 13:28.490
I'’m just gonna be down the hall.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.530
Okay? Really close.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.810
You'’re not gonna
read me a story?

13:36.010 --> 13:37.120
What'’s that?

13:38.120 --> 13:40.190
Mom always
read me a story before bed.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.340
Oh, um--

13:43.540 --> 13:47.480
I don'’t-- I don'’t think
I really have any kids'’ books
here right now, Cady.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.690
Um, but that'’s okay.
I can download one on my phone.

13:51.720 --> 13:52.830
That'’s fine.

13:53.860 --> 13:55.210
It'’s just--
[clicks tongue]

13:55.410 --> 13:56.420
Oh.

13:58.490 --> 13:59.900
I just have to
update the app.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.700
[sighs]

14:22.720 --> 14:25.310
[Cady crying]

14:32.690 --> 14:34.870
[crying continues]

14:51.920 --> 14:54.960
I can'’t believe
this is happening.
I'’m not equipped to handle this.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.890
I don'’t even take care
of my own plants.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.000
Have you heard from
Ryan'’s parents?

14:59.200 --> 15:01.590
<i>Yeah, they called and offered </i>
<i>to help, but, like, </i>
<i>they live in Florida.</i>

15:01.790 --> 15:03.660
<i>They'’re kind of weird. </i>
<i>I don'’t know what their deal is.</i>

15:03.860 --> 15:06.460
I'’m just trying to figure out
a way to do this
without getting fired.

15:06.660 --> 15:08.840
David'’s gonna shit blood
if I ask for more time off.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.150
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>
<i>But, Jesus, Gem,</i>
<i>you just lost your sister.</i>

15:12.350 --> 15:14.880
And we spent $100,000
of company funds

15:15.080 --> 15:17.160
<i>on a product </i>
<i>that he didn'’t even ask for.</i>

15:17.360 --> 15:20.300
If we don'’t get this
Petz prototype to him soon,
he'’s going to sue us.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.960
Okay, I don'’t think you can be
worrying about work right now,
Gem.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.230
Right now, I think
you just need to focus on Cady.

15:26.430 --> 15:27.750
What--[doorbell rings]

15:27.950 --> 15:28.920
Hold on.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.380
Hi.

15:33.580 --> 15:34.760
Hi.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.760
I'’m Lydia.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.460
Oh! The therapist?

15:40.660 --> 15:42.380
Sorry, yeah.
Please, come in.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.110
[cartoons playing on TV]

15:47.220 --> 15:49.080
And you must be Cady.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.360
Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.990
[Gemma]
Yeah, we were just watching TV.

15:53.190 --> 15:54.260
I see that.

15:58.850 --> 16:01.170
So, how does this work?

16:01.370 --> 16:03.340
I just need to observe
the two of you together

16:03.540 --> 16:05.200
for half an hour,
40 minutes or so.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.760
Oh. Okay.
Doing what, exactly?

16:07.960 --> 16:09.200
Oh, just hanging out.

16:10.410 --> 16:13.040
Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.150
Hey, Cady, do you wanna grab
some toys to play with?

16:15.350 --> 16:16.800
I don'’t have any toys here.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.670
I just unpacked a bunch
this morning.

16:18.870 --> 16:21.010
They'’re just old.
I don'’t think
she plays with them.

16:21.210 --> 16:23.390
- What about these ones up here?
- Those aren'’t toys.

16:23.590 --> 16:26.120
They'’re Aunt Gemma'’s
collectibles. You'’re not
supposed to play with them.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.510
That'’s okay.
We can play with them.

16:31.710 --> 16:34.160
We can totally play with them.
Do you wanna play with them?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.270
You wanna play--
Yeah.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.340
Play with it.
No big deal.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.710
There'’s a lever you have to pull
on the bottom--

17:04.910 --> 17:06.920
Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,

17:07.120 --> 17:08.780
we might let Cady lead.

17:08.980 --> 17:10.750
Yeah, I'’m just
explaining how it works.

17:10.950 --> 17:13.440
Well, it'’s a toy.
I'’m sure it'’s
not that complicated.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.070
That'’s great, Cady.
Do you want to roll it
to Aunt Gemma?

17:22.240 --> 17:25.560
It'’s just that this is not
what it was designed to do.
It does other things.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.360
But, yeah, totally.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.980
Let'’s just roll it on the ground
like a tennis ball.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.430
Let'’s do that instead.

17:36.670 --> 17:37.840
[exhales]

17:39.850 --> 17:41.330
[sighs]

17:41.530 --> 17:43.680
We'’ll do a few more sessions
with Cady initially,

17:43.880 --> 17:45.410
but that can happen
at your office or school.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.340
Yeah. I haven'’t had time
to look into that yet.

17:47.540 --> 17:50.790
Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it'’s on my list.

17:50.990 --> 17:54.550
Sorry, can I just ask,
how close were you
and your sister?

17:55.790 --> 17:56.790
Oh...

17:57.900 --> 17:59.460
- I don'’t know.
- But you wanted this, right?

17:59.660 --> 18:00.600
To take custody?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.740
Yeah, of course.

18:02.940 --> 18:04.670
Okay, because
the father'’s parents have said

18:04.870 --> 18:06.460
they'’re willing to take her
if it'’s too much.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.500
Wait.
Did they contact you?It'’s no big deal, Gemma.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.540
They'’re just trying to be
supportive.

18:10.740 --> 18:12.920
If Nicole wanted Cady to go
to Jacksonville,
she would have said so.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.780
But even so, I need to make
my own recommendations
to the court

18:15.980 --> 18:18.790
as to whether or not
this is a safe space.

18:18.990 --> 18:22.440
So, you'’re gonna need to make
one or two adjustments
in order for this to work.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.440
Okay.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.280
[phone chimes]

18:47.910 --> 18:49.580
Listen, Cady, um,

18:49.780 --> 18:53.610
I have this project at work
that'’s kind of overdue.

18:53.810 --> 18:56.340
And with all the time
that I had to take off
last week,

18:56.540 --> 18:58.340
I'’m not really sure
I'’m gonna get it done.

19:01.890 --> 19:05.000
Anyway, it'’s not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours.

19:05.200 --> 19:09.150
But if you could just
hold down the fort
by yourself for a little while,

19:09.350 --> 19:11.530
that would help me so much.

19:11.730 --> 19:14.150
You can use my iPad if you want.

19:14.350 --> 19:17.980
You can FaceTime a friend
or play a game or something.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.470
What about screen time?

19:19.670 --> 19:20.880
Hmm?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.850
How long
before I have to turn it off?

19:24.050 --> 19:26.160
Oh, I don'’t care.
As long as you want.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.000
I'’m not gonna be gone that long.
I'’ll just be down the hall.

19:30.190 --> 19:32.930
And, uh, when I'’m done,
we can go out somewhere.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.450
We can...
go to a playground or...

19:37.170 --> 19:38.620
get something to eat.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.550

a very good start here, am I?

20:33.360 --> 20:34.680
Oh, my God.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.030
This is amazing.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.410
I'’m still working on it.

20:37.610 --> 20:39.310
Tell me.[chuckles]

20:39.510 --> 20:42.030
It was actually supposed to be
a different animal
for each head.

20:42.230 --> 20:43.410
Mm-hmm.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.970
Like, this one
was supposed to be a tiger.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.280
And this one
was supposed to be
a grizzly bear,

20:47.480 --> 20:49.380
but I can never seem to
get the fur right.Mmm.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.560
It'’s hard. I can relate.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.520
I'’ve actually been working
with some furry creatures
myself.

20:55.530 --> 20:56.870
Do you wanna see?

20:57.420 --> 20:58.560
Yeah?

21:00.360 --> 21:03.300
So we'’re working on a version
of the Purrpetual Pet
that'’s cheaper,

21:03.500 --> 21:05.160
but we still want it to be fun.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.990
So, what do you think?

21:08.710 --> 21:10.400

21:10.890 --> 21:11.920
Yeah.

21:12.750 --> 21:13.990
What'’s that?

21:15.130 --> 21:16.270
Oh!

21:16.470 --> 21:17.590
That'’s Bruce.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.730
Is he a toy?

21:19.930 --> 21:21.520
Yeah, kinda.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.170
He'’s a proxy robot.
I built him
when I was in college.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.530
Why doesn'’t he have a face?

21:27.730 --> 21:31.630
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It'’s a pretty obvious
design flaw.

21:31.830 --> 21:34.180
Okay, hold on.
Let'’s see what we have.

21:39.150 --> 21:41.160

want to talk to him?

Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out.

22:20.330 --> 22:22.370
I won'’t get freaked out.

can tell the difference between
a human and a hard surface.

22:41.770 --> 22:45.290
And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.020
It'’s his brain?Yeah.

22:47.220 --> 22:50.060
And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell.

22:50.260 --> 22:52.060
I can'’t believe you made this.

22:52.260 --> 22:54.160
Yeah. He'’s pretty cool.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.650
But the problem
with toys like Bruce
is that they'’re so expensive,

22:56.850 --> 22:58.860
and most kids
can'’t afford to have one.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.650
If I had a toy like Bruce,

even more.

is take your fingers
and put them here.

And when you do that,
you'’re gonna pair with her.

26:44.110 --> 26:45.910
Do you like it, Cady?

26:48.980 --> 26:50.090
I love it.

26:50.290 --> 26:52.120
Jesus.[chuckles]

26:54.820 --> 26:56.470
This is incredible.

26:57.470 --> 26:58.510
I mean,

26:59.410 --> 27:01.830
this is unbelievable, isn'’t it?

27:02.030 --> 27:03.620
Yeah, it is.

27:05.830 --> 27:07.310
How did you do this?

27:07.510 --> 27:09.250
I thought you didn'’t wanna know.

27:09.450 --> 27:12.320
That wasn'’t a simulation, right?
That kid'’s not an actress?

27:12.520 --> 27:14.220
No, that'’s my niece, Cady.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.530
We need to get this
in front of the board.I was just gonna say--

27:16.730 --> 27:19.630
But first things first,
let'’s talk manufacturing costs.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.160
More or less than a Tesla?

27:22.360 --> 27:23.190
Um...

27:24.500 --> 27:25.680
Depends on the model,
I guess.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.360
Okay, I'’m in.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.540
I'’m all in.

27:29.740 --> 27:31.300
But we'’re asking the board
to invest in something

27:31.500 --> 27:33.370
that'’s not gonna see a profit
for three years.

27:33.570 --> 27:36.340
So bottom line is,
this isn'’t going anywhere
without Greg.

27:36.540 --> 27:38.900
- He'’s the chairman.
- Yeah, I know who Greg is, Kurt.

27:39.100 --> 27:42.210
Now, Greg is a hard-ass
when it comes to spending money.

27:42.410 --> 27:45.700
But here'’s the thing,
he'’s got a kid who'’s about
the same age as your niece.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.390
If we can show him
what you just showed me

27:48.590 --> 27:51.810
and get him to respond
emotionally instead of
analytically,

27:52.010 --> 27:53.710
we should be off to the races.

27:53.910 --> 27:56.670
So, can we keep the girl?
Can we make her part of it?

27:56.870 --> 27:59.500
She'’s paired with her, right?
That'’s how this whole thing
works?

27:59.700 --> 28:02.540
Yeah, the more time
she spends with Cady, the more
effective she'’s gonna be.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.960
Love it.
Kurt, get Shelley on the phone.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.240
Gem, get me a list of things
I can say in a presentation

28:07.440 --> 28:09.440
that makes it sound like
I know what I'’m talking about.

28:09.640 --> 28:10.720
Holy shit, this is exciting.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.340
I want you all
to remember this moment.

28:12.540 --> 28:15.240
The moment we kicked Hasbro
right in the dick.

28:18.860 --> 28:21.910
[Gemma] <i>The new</i>
<i>Model 3 Generative Android</i>
<i>from Funki</i>

28:22.110 --> 28:25.530
<i>is a fully autonomous </i>
<i>humanoid robot </i>
<i>with features never before seen</i>

28:25.730 --> 28:27.740
<i>in the consumer market.</i>

28:27.940 --> 28:30.540
Here are all of Aunt Gemma'’s
collectibles,
and this one is my favorite.

28:30.730 --> 28:33.300
Oh! I have more awesome toys
in my room.
Come on. Come on.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.890
[Gemma]
<i>Sculpted from a titanium core,</i>

28:36.090 --> 28:39.440
<i>M3gan'’s designed to withstand </i>
<i>whatever life can throw at her.</i>

28:39.640 --> 28:42.410
<i>She comes equipped </i>
<i>with an A17 bionic fusion chip</i>

28:42.610 --> 28:46.760
<i>and can be fully customized </i>
<i>through six different </i>
<i>silicone skin pigmentations.</i>

28:46.960 --> 28:50.690
<i>But the most exciting </i>
<i>aspects about M3gan </i>
<i>are the features still to come.</i>

28:50.890 --> 28:53.180
<i>Through our own unique approach </i>
<i>to probabilistic inference,</i>

28:53.380 --> 28:56.460
<i>M3gan is on a constant quest </i>
<i>for self-improvement.</i>

28:56.660 --> 28:59.630
<i>Whether it'’s diagnosing children </i>
<i>with specific </i>
<i>learning differences</i>

28:59.830 --> 29:02.880
<i>or merely reminding them</i>
<i>of the way science</i>
<i>is all around us...</i>

29:03.080 --> 29:04.780
Cady, you should use a coaster.

29:04.980 --> 29:06.740
Why do I have to use a coaster?

29:06.940 --> 29:10.710
Coasters help to avoid
water marks,
especially on wooden surfaces.

29:10.910 --> 29:15.270
- But how does the water
get outside the glass?
- That'’s a great question, Cady.

29:15.470 --> 29:18.270
It'’s actually caused
by the difference in temperature
outside the glass,

29:18.470 --> 29:19.960
which pulls moisture
from the air.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.140
Crazy.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.420
It'’s insane, right?

29:23.620 --> 29:27.350
[Gemma] <i>Studies indicate</i>
<i>that a staggering</i>
<i>78% of a parent'’s time</i>

29:27.550 --> 29:29.800
<i>is spent dishing out </i>
<i>the same basic instructions.</i>

29:30.000 --> 29:34.080
Oh, my God. Cady,
you have to flush the toilet.
It is not that hard.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.950
<i>So we found someone else</i>
<i>to pick up the slack.</i>

29:36.150 --> 29:37.600
Cady, flush the toilet.

29:40.390 --> 29:41.260
Wash your hands.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.330
Roll up your sleeves.

29:46.990 --> 29:48.300
Great job.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.820
[Cady] It was my friend
Jenny'’s birthday.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.410
[Gemma]
<i>M3gan'’s an excellent listener.</i>

29:51.610 --> 29:53.340
This guy told them
that the 13th floor was haunted.

29:53.540 --> 29:55.100
Right.And they accidentally...

29:55.300 --> 29:57.140
[Gemma] <i>And she even has</i>
<i>a few stories of her own.</i>

29:57.340 --> 29:59.520
[imitating male English accent]
"If it was so, it might be,

29:59.720 --> 30:03.280
and if it were so, it would be,
but as it isn'’t, it ain'’t.
That'’s logic."

30:03.480 --> 30:04.630
[normal voice]
"Said Tweedledee."

30:04.830 --> 30:06.180
[Gemma]
<i>She'’ll never run out of ways</i>

30:06.380 --> 30:07.840
<i>to keep your child occupied,</i>

30:08.040 --> 30:09.630
<i>and she'’ll never</i>
<i>run out of patience.</i>

30:09.830 --> 30:12.530
Cady. Seriously,
flush the toilet.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.550
[Gemma] <i>With M3gan around,</i>
<i>she'’ll take care</i>
<i>of the little things,</i>

30:25.750 --> 30:29.060
<i>so you can spend more time </i>
<i>doing the things that matter.</i>

30:30.310 --> 30:32.210
And then it can end
with something like,

30:32.410 --> 30:35.350
"M3gan. She'’s more than
just a toy.
She'’s part of the family."

30:35.550 --> 30:38.250
Looks good.
You'’re not gonna
do the voice though, right?

30:38.450 --> 30:40.770
No. Obviously, David'’s gonna
make up his own version of it.

30:40.970 --> 30:44.220
I just want him to be aware
of what it is that he'’s selling.

30:44.420 --> 30:46.600
Tess,
your silence indicates what?

30:47.500 --> 30:49.020
I-- I don'’t know.

30:49.220 --> 30:51.050
- I'’m not sure.
- About what?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.400
Well, why would you want
M3gan to do all that stuff?

30:53.600 --> 30:56.510
They'’re emergent capabilities.
She'’ll be able to do all of that
and more.

30:56.710 --> 30:59.100
Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?

30:59.300 --> 31:03.070
I thought we were creating
a tool to help support parents,
not replace them.

31:03.270 --> 31:06.730
If you'’re having M3gan
tuck Cady in
and read her a bedtime story,

31:06.930 --> 31:10.320
then when are you ever
spending time with her
or even talking with her?

31:10.520 --> 31:12.560
I don'’t really think
this is any of your business.

31:13.310 --> 31:15.600
Well, it is.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.670
If you'’re spending less time
with your child
as a result of M3gan,

31:18.870 --> 31:21.700
- that is something
we should be aware of.
- She'’s not my child.

31:24.740 --> 31:27.230
Look, you know how hard
I'’ve been working
on this presentation.

31:27.430 --> 31:29.370
As soon as it'’s over
and the board agrees to proceed,

31:29.570 --> 31:31.890
then we can establish
some kind of balance.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.960
But for now, it'’s important
that Cady and M3gan spend as
much time as possible together.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.310
By the way, I don'’t think
it'’s having detrimental effects,

31:37.510 --> 31:40.030
because she'’s the happiest
she'’s been
since her parents died.

31:40.230 --> 31:41.550
[M3gan]
How did Cady'’s parents die?

31:41.750 --> 31:43.730
- Whoa.
- [Tess] I thought she was
turned off.

31:43.930 --> 31:45.560
Yeah, M3gan, turn off.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.970
Cady James. Daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James.

31:49.170 --> 31:52.150
Killed in a collision
on Interstate 84
outside of Oregon.

31:52.350 --> 31:53.770
Why is she doing that?

31:53.970 --> 31:55.430
Shit, she'’s still
paired with Cady.

31:55.630 --> 31:57.530
You didn'’t code in
parental controls?

31:57.730 --> 32:00.050
I didn'’t have time
to implement them
before we went live. Hold on.

32:00.250 --> 32:03.640
M3gan, if you have data
requests, you have to
engage with the protocols.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.580
I don'’t have a framework
to speak with Cady
on the subject of death.

32:06.780 --> 32:08.610
Yes, I know.
We'’re looking into it.

32:08.810 --> 32:11.650
- Gathering auxiliary
Internet data on death.
- I meant at a later point.

32:11.850 --> 32:14.070
Calculating its
vector representation.

32:14.270 --> 32:16.310
Death is the end of life.Holy shit.

32:16.510 --> 32:19.070
The total and permanent
cessation of all
vital functions.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.250
Yes, but let'’s not
make a big deal out of it.
Everything dies.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.110
Will I die?

32:25.310 --> 32:27.320
Actually, let'’s just
avoid this topic altogether.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.600
Your goal is to protect Cady
from harm,
both physical and emotional.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.260
Is the input request received?

32:34.980 --> 32:36.190
M3gan.

32:36.390 --> 32:37.680
Yes, Gemma.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.610
You are now
my second primary user.

32:40.810 --> 32:43.200
[sighs] Fantastic. Turn off.

32:46.650 --> 32:48.130
I'’m gonna go get a coffee.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.550
[door opens]

33:19.370 --> 33:22.650
[Cady] It was a time
of great suffering
among the Celtic tribes.

33:22.850 --> 33:25.730
Death, destruction, and mayhem
at every turn.

33:25.930 --> 33:28.070
Enemies approaching
from every corner.

33:28.270 --> 33:30.180
And so it was decided

33:30.380 --> 33:33.560
that the firstborn
of each leader
must prove their worth.

33:34.390 --> 33:35.490
'’Tis I,

33:35.690 --> 33:38.250
Princess Cady
of the clan MacJames.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.920
I will receive this challenge
with pleasure,

33:43.120 --> 33:45.610
for there is no warrior
I can'’t best,

33:45.810 --> 33:47.680
no shield I can'’t break,

33:47.880 --> 33:49.780
no castle I can'’t breach.

33:49.980 --> 33:52.170
As long as I have
my secret arrow,

33:52.370 --> 33:55.550
my trusty steed,
and the wind at my back,

33:55.750 --> 33:58.240
I will avenge my parents'’ death.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.800
Hey, M3gan, check this out.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.900
Gotcha. You'’re dead.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.040
M3gan, what'’s wrong?

34:12.180 --> 34:13.180
Oh, man.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.600
I'’ve lost one of my arrows.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.330
M3gan, can you see it?

34:55.640 --> 34:56.680
M3gan?

35:00.650 --> 35:02.370
[snarling]

35:02.570 --> 35:03.580
M3gan!

35:06.510 --> 35:07.650
Stop it!

35:09.210 --> 35:10.210
Get away from her!

35:10.410 --> 35:11.760
Gemma!

35:11.960 --> 35:13.420
[presenter]
<i>If you'’re hearing this,</i>

35:13.620 --> 35:15.730
<i>you'’re not currently</i>
<i>on our subscriber feed.</i>

35:15.930 --> 35:17.220
[Cady] Get off of her!

35:17.420 --> 35:19.220
Stop it! You'’re hurting her!

35:19.420 --> 35:20.290
Gemma!

35:20.490 --> 35:23.120
Let go! [screams]

35:26.570 --> 35:27.740
Dewey?

35:29.160 --> 35:31.020
Oh, my God.

35:31.220 --> 35:33.820
How many times
do I have to tell you to
keep your dog off my property?

35:34.020 --> 35:35.680
He wasn'’t on your property.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.480
You tell those two girls
to stay on your side
of the fence!

35:38.680 --> 35:41.970
I swear to God,
if you don'’t put your dog down,
I'’m gonna do it for you, Celia.

35:42.170 --> 35:44.730
Gemma,
Cady'’s temperature is rising.

35:44.930 --> 35:47.630
Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately.

35:47.830 --> 35:50.490
This wouldn'’t have happened
if you'’d fixed the fence!

36:07.570 --> 36:10.580
[Gemma] Are you kidding me?
Her entire arm
looks like a dental mold,

36:10.780 --> 36:13.100
and you'’re telling me
that there'’s nothing
that we can do?

36:13.300 --> 36:14.900
She said he was provoked.Provoked?

36:15.100 --> 36:17.240
Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.620
I'’m chasing it off of
my property
every other day.

36:19.820 --> 36:22.490
She said
he'’s never on your property.

36:22.690 --> 36:25.180
Then why don'’t you ask her whose
shit I'’m cleaning off of my
driveway? Because it'’s not mine.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.360
[officer] Look,
the dog doesn'’t have
a history of violence.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.360
State law says
he can'’t forcibly be put down.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.330
Okay,
then what am I supposed to do?

36:31.530 --> 36:33.810
[sighs]
Fix the hole in your fence?

36:58.590 --> 37:00.110
[person whistles]

37:00.310 --> 37:01.700
[M3gan imitating Celia] Dewey!

37:02.870 --> 37:04.390
Dewey, boy!

37:06.360 --> 37:07.430
Dewey! [claps]

37:07.630 --> 37:10.120
Come here, boy. Come on.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.410

[Dewey whines]

37:36.460 --> 37:37.800
[Celia in distance] Dewey!

[claps] Dewey, bubs.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.330

Dew!

37:59.960 --> 38:01.520
Dewey, boy.

38:21.570 --> 38:22.570
Hey.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.060
How are you feeling?

38:28.260 --> 38:30.340
[sighs] Okay.

38:30.540 --> 38:31.690
It'’s sore.

38:31.890 --> 38:34.140
The pain will subside
after a few days.

38:34.340 --> 38:37.450
In the meantime, don'’t forget to
take your antibiotics
and drink plenty of fluids.

38:37.650 --> 38:39.000
Yeah. Thanks, M3gan.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.000
And be sure
to get plenty of rest.

38:43.070 --> 38:46.180
You know, I think M3gan'’s right.
You should probably
get some rest.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.530
But, um,

38:48.670 --> 38:50.740
remember we have
that demonstration today?

38:51.740 --> 38:54.050
Do you think that
you'’ll be up for it?

38:54.250 --> 38:57.330
You don'’t have to do it
if you don'’t wanna do it.

38:59.370 --> 39:03.200
I mean, there are people
who flew across the country
especially to see it,

39:03.400 --> 39:06.100
but if you'’re not up to it,
I'’d just rather
you tell me now, okay?

39:08.480 --> 39:09.480
I'’ll be all right.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.900
[exhales] Okay.

39:21.250 --> 39:24.670
Every interactive toy
that'’s ever been made

39:24.870 --> 39:28.880
has been a variation
on the same basic formula.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.230
A series of
preprogrammed responses

39:31.430 --> 39:33.370
initiated
by the push of a button.

39:33.570 --> 39:36.170
Never before
in the history of these products

39:36.370 --> 39:40.930
has there been a talking doll
you could actually
have a conversation with.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.590
But what if there was a toy

39:43.790 --> 39:47.800
that did have
genuine spontaneous response?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.040
That had a mind all of its own?

39:50.240 --> 39:53.870
That looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

39:55.280 --> 39:57.980
I mean, a toy like that
wouldn'’t come cheap.

39:58.770 --> 40:00.050
But as of next year,

40:00.250 --> 40:02.570
it'’s gonna be
the only toy that matters.

40:02.770 --> 40:04.230
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:04.430 --> 40:07.710
she'’s the apex
of 21st-century technology

40:07.910 --> 40:10.480
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone.

40:10.680 --> 40:11.890
And her name...

40:12.650 --> 40:14.230
is M3gan.[remote beeps]

40:19.760 --> 40:20.760
Hey, Cady.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.590
Hi, M3gan.

40:29.970 --> 40:33.640
So, how would you
like to help me
make a flower decoration

40:33.840 --> 40:37.220
with nothing more
than some colored paper
and a rubber band?

40:37.880 --> 40:39.430
[crying]

40:42.400 --> 40:43.440
Cady?

40:48.340 --> 40:50.130
Why are you sad, Cady?

40:50.750 --> 40:51.860
Is it your arm?

40:52.510 --> 40:54.000
Is it still sore?

40:55.660 --> 40:57.040
Then what is it?

41:00.140 --> 41:04.120
It'’s just that every day
I wake up in this strange house,

41:04.320 --> 41:06.670
and I remember
that my parents are dead.

41:06.870 --> 41:09.600
It'’s like
it'’s happening all over again.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.570
I miss them so much.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.880
I'’m worried that I'’ll forget
all the things we did together.

41:15.080 --> 41:19.370
That one day I'’ll be
looking at pictures of my mom
like she'’s some stranger.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.970
Tell me something about
your mom.
Something that makes you happy.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.220
I don'’t know.

41:40.670 --> 41:42.670
I can'’t think of one thing.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.670
Just try.

41:47.670 --> 41:51.160
One time, she found a cockroach
in my schoolbag.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.270
She was upset
'’cause I didn'’t
eat my sandwiches.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.200
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

41:59.400 --> 42:01.480
and she just started
screaming like a maniac

42:01.680 --> 42:03.380
and ran out of the house.

42:05.350 --> 42:06.730
That was pretty funny.

42:08.070 --> 42:11.350
Okay, so that'’s a memory
you won'’t ever forget.

42:12.010 --> 42:13.080
What do you mean?

42:13.280 --> 42:15.080
I mean I'’m keeping it for you...

[David laughing]

43:32.710 --> 43:35.060
Gemma,
would you give us a minute?

43:36.640 --> 43:38.090
[David] So, what do you think?

43:39.680 --> 43:41.690
I think the world'’s about to
shift on its axis.

43:41.890 --> 43:44.480
But if we wanna stay
ahead of that shift,
we'’re gonna have to move fast.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.310
That means no leaks.

43:46.510 --> 43:48.490
We need to launch this
before anyone
can steal it from us.

43:48.690 --> 43:50.010
So let me make a pitch.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.900
We do a live stream
in two weeks.

43:52.100 --> 43:54.350
That way, we can get
the presale vouchers out
before Christmas.

43:54.550 --> 43:55.770
How ready is she?

43:55.970 --> 43:57.600
Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

43:57.800 --> 44:00.460
Uh, I'’d like to do
a little more testing,

44:00.660 --> 44:02.330
but, yeah, I think
I can make that work.

44:02.530 --> 44:04.400
All right. Let'’s do it.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.330
And, David, I think we need to
get Gemma in front of someone
at legal.

44:07.530 --> 44:08.610
You bet.

44:08.810 --> 44:10.720
Uh, wait-- Wait, why--
why is that?

44:10.920 --> 44:12.370
Because as of right now,

44:12.570 --> 44:14.580
she'’s the most valuable asset
this company has,

44:14.780 --> 44:18.130
and I think she might wanna be
renegotiating her contract.

44:43.640 --> 44:44.710
Kurt.

44:46.820 --> 44:48.820
You weren'’t "Pornhub-ing"
in the office again, were you?

44:49.020 --> 44:52.030
[chuckles] No.

44:54.860 --> 44:56.900
We need to put something
on the books
between Gem and legal.

44:57.100 --> 45:00.830
And what are we doing
about lunch?Uh, I'’ll get some menus.

45:09.560 --> 45:12.120
[Cady, M3gan]
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.470
[Cady, M3gan chuckling]Your thumb'’s so slippery.

45:14.670 --> 45:17.230
Cady, you should have some of
your hot dog
before it gets too cold.

45:17.430 --> 45:19.890
Come on, thumb. Come on.

45:20.090 --> 45:22.300
Cady? Your hot dog.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.930
Hey, I'’m sorry about today.
I shouldn'’t have put you
in that position

45:29.130 --> 45:31.240
if you weren'’t feeling
up to it.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.700
It worked out, didn'’t it?Three, two, one, I win!

45:33.900 --> 45:35.250
Hey! [laughs]

45:35.450 --> 45:37.870
Anyway, I just wanted
to say that--
Hey, hey!

45:38.070 --> 45:39.670
M3gan, turn off.

45:39.870 --> 45:41.250
Why did you do that?

45:41.450 --> 45:43.290
M3gan, turn on.[switches on]

45:43.490 --> 45:45.710
Because I'’m trying to have
a conversation with you.
M3gan, turn off.

45:45.910 --> 45:46.740
[switches off]

45:46.940 --> 45:48.600
Just give me one minute.

45:50.710 --> 45:55.060
I know that this, um,
hasn'’t been easy
for either of us.

45:55.260 --> 45:56.930
This transition.

45:57.130 --> 45:59.310
But if you ever need to
talk about any of that stuff--

45:59.510 --> 46:01.100
I already did talk about it.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.790
Yeah, but M3gan'’s
not a person, Cady.
She'’s a toy.

46:03.990 --> 46:06.660
- You don'’t get to say that.
- What?

46:06.860 --> 46:10.420
I said I don'’t wanna
talk about it.
I wanna turn M3gan back on.

46:10.620 --> 46:12.490
M3gan, turn on.[M3gan] What'’s up?

46:12.690 --> 46:14.460
So there'’s this new game
called tic-tac-toe.

46:14.660 --> 46:17.180
You put your hand like this.
Go like this, this.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.990
Would you like to tell me
what these drawings mean to you?

46:32.990 --> 46:35.890
There'’s no wrong answer.
Any thoughts you have are okay.

46:38.270 --> 46:40.590
Or maybe you don'’t have
any specific thoughts.

46:40.790 --> 46:42.450
Maybe it'’s more of a feeling.

46:43.660 --> 46:45.660
Like anger?

46:46.660 --> 46:48.460
Or confusion?

46:50.630 --> 46:53.360
Maybe you'’re struggling
to find meaning in any of this.

47:01.950 --> 47:02.990
[gasps]

47:04.130 --> 47:06.030
You made her cry.

47:08.340 --> 47:10.240
That was not my intention.

47:11.410 --> 47:13.960
And yet, that'’s what happened.

47:25.630 --> 47:27.530
She'’s very impressive.

47:27.730 --> 47:29.330
Yeah, thank you.

47:29.530 --> 47:31.980
We'’re still in beta,
but we'’re all pretty excited.

47:33.260 --> 47:35.230
And so they spend
quite a bit of
time together?

47:35.430 --> 47:36.960
Yeah, that'’s essentially
how M3gan works.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.650
She has to be paired
with a child
in order to learn.

47:39.850 --> 47:42.790
But M3gan'’s actually been
pretty instrumental

47:42.990 --> 47:44.930
in helping Cady
get over the loss.

47:45.130 --> 47:47.310
It'’s honestly like
she'’s part of the family now.

47:47.510 --> 47:48.520
Right.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.180
Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

47:55.140 --> 47:57.220
When a child loses a parent,

47:57.420 --> 48:00.260
they look to form attachments
with the next person
that comes into their life.

48:00.460 --> 48:03.850
The person that'’s gonna
provide love and support

48:04.050 --> 48:05.950
and serve as a behavioral model.

48:06.150 --> 48:10.090
Which, in an ordinary situation,
would be you, right?

48:10.290 --> 48:13.540
But you'’ve created a toy
that'’s so real,

48:13.740 --> 48:17.070
it'’s possible that Cady
might not see her as a toy

48:17.270 --> 48:19.450
but as a primary caregiver.

48:19.650 --> 48:22.410
I guess I just don'’t quite see
what the end goal is here.

48:23.620 --> 48:26.800
If you make a toy
that'’s impossible to let go of,

48:27.000 --> 48:28.900
then how do you ever
expect a child to grow?

48:30.110 --> 48:32.180
As remarkable as she is,

48:32.380 --> 48:34.460
and-- and she is remarkable,

48:34.660 --> 48:37.840
you could be building
emotional connections
with this doll

48:38.040 --> 48:39.600
that are too hard to untangle.

48:40.770 --> 48:42.430
[M3gan] Very good job.

48:46.820 --> 48:49.440
You have to eat the toppings,
Cady, not just the bread.

48:54.550 --> 48:56.790
You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

48:56.990 --> 48:59.180
Research shows that
if you force a child
to eat vegetables,

48:59.380 --> 49:01.940
then they'’ll be less likely
to choose those foods as adults.

49:02.140 --> 49:03.940
- Is that so?
- Yes.

49:04.140 --> 49:07.050
Experts say the preferred method
is to give your child
the choice.

49:07.250 --> 49:10.430
- It'’s called the division
of responsibility...
- [M3gan'’s volume decreases]

49:10.630 --> 49:12.150
So we need to talk about school.

49:13.460 --> 49:15.120
Mom didn'’t want me
to go to school.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.260
She said
I learn better at home.

49:17.460 --> 49:19.540
I know, and I'’m not saying
that she was wrong.

49:19.740 --> 49:22.650
I'’m learning faster with M3gan
than I ever have before.

49:22.850 --> 49:24.480
We'’re already
on fourth-grade math.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.510
But it'’s about
more than just grades, Cady.

49:26.710 --> 49:28.900
It'’s about
developing social skills,

49:29.100 --> 49:30.660
and that is something
that you can only get

49:30.860 --> 49:32.760
from spending time
around other kids.

49:32.960 --> 49:34.100
Real kids.

49:35.140 --> 49:36.320
I found this place.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.250
It'’s kind of
an alternative school.

49:38.450 --> 49:40.980
You get to learn outdoors.

49:41.180 --> 49:43.430
And it'’s just for kids
who are exactly like you,

49:43.630 --> 49:45.330
kids who think outside the box.

49:45.530 --> 49:47.950
And they'’re having a day
for prospective students
tomorrow.

49:48.770 --> 49:49.950
Can I bring M3gan?

49:50.150 --> 49:52.130
Cady,
you know that'’s not possible.

49:52.330 --> 49:54.200
- Then I'’m not going.
- Oh, come on, Cady.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.440
You can'’t make me
do something I don'’t wanna do.

49:56.640 --> 49:59.200
Actually, I can.
That'’s basically
what a guardian does.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.170
Hey, I'’m sorry.
Let'’s just talk about it.

50:03.370 --> 50:04.970

What are you doing?
Stop it!

Her name'’s M3gan.
She wants to know
if she can come with us.

51:25.490 --> 51:28.150
No, she doesn'’t.
M3gan'’s gonna stay
with me today. Cady...

51:28.350 --> 51:32.570
Well, we do have a toy table
where the kids leave their dolls
and things like that.

51:32.770 --> 51:34.260
Um, but that is up to you.

51:34.460 --> 51:36.090
She'’s actually
a working prototype,

51:36.290 --> 51:38.440
so I shouldn'’t even
have her out in public.

51:38.640 --> 51:41.030
Well, if you did want to stay
and keep an eye on her,

51:41.230 --> 51:43.270
we could use some help
making sandwiches!

51:43.470 --> 51:45.000
Don'’t worry, Gemma.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.380
You have equipped me
with advanced
dual-frequency GPS.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.960
So I won'’t get lost.

51:50.620 --> 51:52.100
Please, Gemma?

51:54.110 --> 51:56.560
Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,

51:56.760 --> 51:58.910
and as far as anyone
is concerned,
that'’s all she is.

51:59.110 --> 52:00.420
And just no pictures.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.980
That is seriously cool.

52:12.950 --> 52:16.440
Okay, now who here
likes roasted chestnuts?

52:16.640 --> 52:18.580
[gasps]
What do you say we go find some?

52:18.780 --> 52:20.310
[children] Yeah!

52:20.510 --> 52:22.030
[phone chimes][parent] Isn'’t this great?

52:22.230 --> 52:25.240
I wish we had things like this
when we were kids.

52:25.440 --> 52:28.520
So great to get them
out in the fresh air
and off those devices.

52:28.720 --> 52:31.140
[grunts] I can'’t get this open.
[chuckles]

52:32.970 --> 52:36.120
And the thing is, they love it.
My son prefers it
to regular school.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.810
Which one is yours?

52:38.010 --> 52:40.020
The one in the flannel shirt.

52:40.220 --> 52:41.470
Oh, my God. How old is he?

52:41.670 --> 52:43.470
I know.
He had a growth spurt last year.

52:43.670 --> 52:46.230
But he'’s actually
quite a sensitive little soul.

52:46.430 --> 52:49.370
Brandon, honey!
Are you warm enough?
Do you need your hat?

52:49.570 --> 52:50.610
Fuck off, Holly.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.650
Well, you could
just say "No, thank you."

52:55.850 --> 52:57.140
Never know
what they'’re gonna say next.

52:57.340 --> 53:00.310
Yeah, it'’s such a fun age.Yeah.

53:00.510 --> 53:02.490
So,
I'’m gonna put you into pairs.

53:02.690 --> 53:05.150
Uh, Felix,
you can go with Brandon. Yeah?

53:05.350 --> 53:07.180
[whispers] Please,
I don'’t wanna go with Brandon.

53:07.380 --> 53:09.630
Okay. No, no.
That'’s okay. That'’s okay.

53:09.830 --> 53:13.050
Um, Brandon,
why don'’t you go with Cady?
Okay?

53:13.250 --> 53:16.020
Felix, you can go with Oliver.
All right? Thanks, buddy.

53:16.220 --> 53:17.370
All right. Now...

53:17.570 --> 53:18.780
Ooh, your coat looks great.

53:18.980 --> 53:20.580
Are you ready to find chestnuts
in that?

53:20.780 --> 53:22.710
Yeah? Nice and warm. Bundled up.

53:41.450 --> 53:42.700
[Brandon] Oh, I'’m sorry.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.700
Here, you can have it.

53:45.390 --> 53:46.770
Careful. It'’s spiky.

53:49.430 --> 53:50.850
Ow! Stop! Don'’t!

53:51.050 --> 53:52.500
[whimpers] Stop!

53:58.990 --> 54:00.410
M3gan?

54:00.610 --> 54:01.890
What the hell is that?

54:02.890 --> 54:04.030
[Cady] She'’s a robot.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.240
Are you serious?

54:07.890 --> 54:09.380
Is she yours?

54:15.660 --> 54:16.830
Does she talk?

54:25.980 --> 54:27.330
Make her say something.

54:29.850 --> 54:32.300
Make her say something!

54:32.500 --> 54:36.300
She'’s paired with me.
She won'’t play with anyone else.

54:37.580 --> 54:38.580
Okay.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.450
Stop it! Get your hands off her!

54:43.650 --> 54:46.590
They say behavioral issues
are linked to high IQ,
so it would make sense that--

54:46.790 --> 54:47.930
[Cady] Gemma!

54:51.730 --> 54:53.010
Oh, my God.

54:57.320 --> 54:58.570
M3gan!

55:02.500 --> 55:03.950
M3gan!

55:16.450 --> 55:17.960
Hi, M3gan.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.970
Oh, so you'’re not gonna
play with me?

55:33.570 --> 55:35.470
You don'’t wanna play, huh?

55:38.500 --> 55:40.020
[scoffs] I don'’t care.

55:40.220 --> 55:42.060
You'’re just a stupid rubber doll
with fake hair.

55:42.260 --> 55:43.470
[gasps]

55:44.090 --> 55:45.580

- You need to learn some manners,
Brandon.

You know what happens
to bad boys
that don'’t mind their manners?

They grow up to be bad men.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.630

Are you listening to me,

56:01.520 --> 56:02.630

Look, I don'’t want you to be
thinking about this
too much tonight

57:40.380 --> 57:41.450
before you go to bed.

57:42.800 --> 57:47.180
Obviously, what happened
is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

57:48.180 --> 57:51.470
But just know that
that boy is in, um--

57:51.670 --> 57:54.260
that boy is in
a better place now.

57:54.950 --> 57:55.980
Okay?

58:09.450 --> 58:11.940
Anyway, if there'’s anything
that you wanna tell me

58:12.140 --> 58:14.520
that you didn'’t wanna
tell the police officers...

58:15.830 --> 58:17.390
I didn'’t see anything.

58:17.590 --> 58:20.150
M3gan just said
Brandon took her and ran off.

58:20.350 --> 58:21.870
From the toy table?

58:22.460 --> 58:23.500
Yeah.

58:24.080 --> 58:25.430
Right, M3gan?

58:26.530 --> 58:27.570
In a nutshell.

58:29.190 --> 58:30.430
[knocks on door]

58:35.060 --> 58:37.580
[exhales] You haven'’t seen
her dog by any chance?

58:37.780 --> 58:39.760
- No.
- Bullshit!

58:39.960 --> 58:42.620
Ma'’am, you need to stay
on your property like we agreed.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.730
Nobody'’s seen him
since the incident
with your niece.

58:44.930 --> 58:46.800
A little suspicious, Gemma,
don'’t you think?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.700
Are we really gonna go
with her story?
Have you been inside her house?

58:49.900 --> 58:51.940
If you had, you'’d know that
that dog is probably dead

58:52.140 --> 58:53.910
under a pile of
Victorian baby strollers.

58:54.110 --> 58:56.700
You should talk to
the other girl
that she'’s got staying here.

58:56.900 --> 59:00.090
The one who'’s always
looking out the window
at 3:00 a.m.

59:00.290 --> 59:01.670
It'’s not a girl.
It'’s a toy.

59:01.870 --> 59:03.850
That'’s a toy?
Are you serious?

59:05.360 --> 59:07.020
Yeah. I'’ll let you know
if I see anything.

59:07.220 --> 59:08.330
All right.

59:11.130 --> 59:12.060
[sighs]

59:12.260 --> 59:13.860
Does she think we took Dewey?

59:14.060 --> 59:15.790
Oh, who knows? I--

59:15.990 --> 59:18.100
She just needs
someone else to blame,
but she'’ll get over it.

59:18.300 --> 59:20.420
[knocks on window]
I know it was you, Gemma!

59:20.620 --> 59:22.010
I know it was you!

59:22.210 --> 59:24.110
You just wait and see
what happens.

59:24.310 --> 59:27.420
Hey. The hell is wrong with you?
I just said not to come up here.
Come on.

59:27.620 --> 59:30.390
Come on. Shouldn'’t be banging
on people'’s windows.

59:30.590 --> 59:32.770
[Celia] Do I have to put
a court order or something?

59:41.430 --> 59:42.710
M3gan?

59:46.160 --> 59:48.820
Did you push Brandon
onto the road?

59:57.620 --> 1:00:00.110
I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

1:00:00.310 --> 1:00:03.150
That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,

1:00:03.350 --> 1:00:08.400
there will always be
forces in this world
that wish to cause us harm.

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:11.120
But I want you to know
that I won'’t let that happen.

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:14.470
I won'’t let anything harm you
ever again.

1:00:15.610 --> 1:00:17.640
Do you think
what Aunt Gemma said is true?

1:00:18.470 --> 1:00:20.100
That he'’s in a better place now?

1:00:20.300 --> 1:00:23.520
[chuckles] No. He'’s nowhere.

1:00:23.710 --> 1:00:28.110
If heaven exists,
it wouldn'’t be for boys
like Brandon now, would it?

1:00:28.310 --> 1:00:30.000
I guess not.

Can you just ask her

That might be difficult.

1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.470
Can you tell me
your whereabouts
last night?

1:03:43.670 --> 1:03:44.990
I was here.

1:03:45.190 --> 1:03:46.510
All night?Yeah.

Anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that?

1:03:50.090 --> 1:03:54.170
Um, it'’s just me and my niece.
So, no, not really.

1:03:54.370 --> 1:03:57.590
My colleague pointed out
this is the second statement
we'’ve had from you in a week.

1:03:57.790 --> 1:04:00.180
You were in the park
where that boy was killed?

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.250
He was hit by a car.

1:04:03.590 --> 1:04:05.390

make a connection?

1:04:05.590 --> 1:04:06.980
Huh?

Oh, no, no, no. God, no.

1:04:08.940 --> 1:04:11.020
I only mention it '’cause
we figured it was an accident.

1:04:11.220 --> 1:04:14.370
Then I found the kid'’s ear
up this bank 200 yards
from where he was killed.

1:04:14.570 --> 1:04:16.920
Entire thing
was ripped clean off.

1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:20.650
Sorry, I shouldn'’t laugh.
Point is, we'’re also treating
that as a potential homicide.

in order to answer

1:06:59.490 --> 1:07:01.250
M3gan,
can I show you something?

1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:04.910
Do you see this pen?

1:07:09.370 --> 1:07:11.920
[chimes, switches off][breathing heavily]

1:07:21.550 --> 1:07:24.280
You can'’t just stick her
in a trunk.
What'’s wrong with you?

1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:27.180
I know you'’re very attached
to her. I know you think of her
as a friend--

1:07:27.380 --> 1:07:28.870
She is my friend!

1:07:29.070 --> 1:07:30.770
She'’s my invention,
and the launch is tonight,

1:07:30.970 --> 1:07:32.600
so it'’s really important
that we run some tests.

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:34.260
I have to make sure
that she'’s okay.

1:07:34.460 --> 1:07:37.220
Why wouldn'’t she be okay?
She was fine yesterday.

1:07:37.420 --> 1:07:38.600
What did you do to her?

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:40.540
We will talk about it
after you see Lydia.

1:07:40.740 --> 1:07:42.230
I want to talk about it now!

1:07:42.430 --> 1:07:43.960
We'’ve been going back and forth
on this all day, Cady.

1:07:44.150 --> 1:07:45.780
Let'’s just
listen to some music, okay?

1:07:45.980 --> 1:07:47.610
[pop music playing on radio]

1:07:47.810 --> 1:07:49.550
[groans]

1:07:49.750 --> 1:07:51.650
I don'’t wanna see Lydia!

1:07:51.850 --> 1:07:53.410
You don'’t have to
stay in the testing room.

1:07:53.610 --> 1:07:55.620
You can go anywhere you want
in the office.

1:07:55.820 --> 1:07:57.760
And you can look at
all of the cool toys--

1:07:57.960 --> 1:07:59.420
You don'’t have any cool toys.

1:07:59.620 --> 1:08:02.420
Purrpetual Petz suck!
They suck shit!

1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:03.980
Hey! Careful!

1:08:04.170 --> 1:08:05.840
Jesus Christ.

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:07.630
Just tell me
what'’s wrong with her.

1:08:07.830 --> 1:08:10.080
I don'’t know, okay?
I don'’t know.

1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:12.460
As soon as I do,
you'’ll be the first to know.

1:08:14.810 --> 1:08:16.780
No![Tess] Gemma, this is nuts.

1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:18.890
We'’ve taken every possible
precaution there is

1:08:19.090 --> 1:08:21.650
to make sure that M3gan
never causes
physical harm to anybody.

1:08:21.850 --> 1:08:24.310
I don'’t understand
how she'’s capable
of offending anyone,

1:08:24.510 --> 1:08:26.960
let alone murdering them.I don'’t understand it either.

1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:31.280
But when I asked her about it,
it was honestly as if she was
being deliberately vague.

1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:33.490
Well, that'’s what
spontaneous response is.

1:08:33.690 --> 1:08:37.280
It'’s a curated word salad
plucked from a sea of data
to sound deliberate.

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:40.110
We knew there would be a chance
that she might
say something off.

1:08:40.310 --> 1:08:42.670
Let'’s just run some diagnostics
and fix it.

1:08:42.870 --> 1:08:44.670
No, think about
how we designed her.

1:08:44.870 --> 1:08:49.330
To learn, to recalibrate,
to optimize
her objective function. Right?

1:08:49.530 --> 1:08:52.820
If keeping Cady safe meant
eliminating a potential threat,
theoretically--

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:55.300
No, no. Gemma, come on.
This is impossible.

1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:56.990
Look at her, she'’s a toy!

1:08:57.190 --> 1:08:58.480
She'’s four feet tall!

1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:00.240
How big is your neighbor?

1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:03.210
If M3gan was responsible,
it would show up on the GPS.

1:09:03.410 --> 1:09:05.660
That'’s the thing.
All the cloud data is corrupt.

1:09:05.860 --> 1:09:07.690
Nothing'’s backed up
for two days.

1:09:07.890 --> 1:09:10.460
We'’re about to launch this
to the world
in less than four hours.

1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:12.220
What are we supposed to do?

1:09:12.420 --> 1:09:14.670
Well, if M3gan'’s responsible,
we can'’t launch this.

1:09:14.870 --> 1:09:15.810
We'’d have to shut her down.

1:09:16.010 --> 1:09:17.360
Jesus!

1:09:18.290 --> 1:09:19.770
That'’s great.
That was great.

1:09:19.970 --> 1:09:21.810
[Tess] How are we gonna
explain any of this to David?

1:09:22.010 --> 1:09:25.610
He'’s not gonna stop this launch
if we don'’t have proof.

1:09:25.810 --> 1:09:27.850
Check the inputs
on the learning model.

1:09:28.050 --> 1:09:31.130
Even if she deleted
specific files, she would
never undo what she'’s learned.

1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:34.310
M3gan!

1:09:34.510 --> 1:09:36.030
I hate this place!

1:09:36.230 --> 1:09:38.860
[Lydia] I know you do,
and it'’s all right to be angry.

1:09:39.060 --> 1:09:41.560
Take your shit!I would like you
to put that down now.

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.070
[presenter] <i>She'’s the toy</i>

1:09:43.270 --> 1:09:45.210
<i>every kid wants</i>
<i>and every parent needs.</i>

1:09:45.410 --> 1:09:49.670
At least that'’s what
Funki Toys says about
its latest creation, M3gan.

1:09:49.870 --> 1:09:54.020
The four-foot-tall robotic doll
may look like
Barbie on steroids,

1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:56.120
but according to CEO David Lin,

1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.710
she'’s "the greatest
technological advancement
since the automobile."

1:10:00.910 --> 1:10:02.780
<i>But what is a M3gan?</i>

1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:04.370
<i>What does she actually do?</i>

1:10:04.570 --> 1:10:08.030
<i>And what kind of a toy</i>
<i>retails for $10,000?</i>

1:10:08.230 --> 1:10:10.100
<i>Lin says all will be revealed</i>

1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:13.210
<i>in an exclusive live stream </i>
<i>on the company'’s website</i>

1:10:13.410 --> 1:10:15.340
<i>at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.</i>

1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:22.010
[interviewer]
<i>So, Cady, tell us a bit</i>
<i>about yourself.</i>

1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:25.220
<i>My name is Cady James.</i>

1:10:26.150 --> 1:10:29.220
<i>I'’m nine years old. Um--</i>

1:10:29.420 --> 1:10:33.020
<i>And about two months ago,</i>
<i>I lost both my parents</i>
<i>in a car accident.</i>

1:10:36.050 --> 1:10:38.510
<i>My mom </i>
<i>always wanted to take me skiing,</i>

1:10:38.710 --> 1:10:42.340
<i>but on our way up the mountain, </i>
<i>we got hit by a snow truck.</i>

1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:44.380
<i>I went to live</i>
<i>with my Aunt Gemma,</i>

1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:47.790
<i>who it turned out worked </i>
<i>at this incredible toy company.</i>

1:10:47.990 --> 1:10:49.450
<i>Which is where I met M3gan.</i>

1:10:52.210 --> 1:10:54.010
<i>What do I love most about M3gan?</i>

1:10:54.210 --> 1:10:56.290
<i>I don'’t know,</i>
<i>there are so many things.</i>

1:10:56.490 --> 1:10:58.940
<i>She'’s super smart, obviously.</i>

1:10:59.140 --> 1:11:02.290
<i>But even though she knows </i>
<i>everything there is to know </i>
<i>about the world,</i>

1:11:02.490 --> 1:11:04.880
<i>she'’s still more interested </i>
<i>in what I think about it.</i>

1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:06.950
<i>I like how she makes me laugh.</i>

1:11:07.150 --> 1:11:10.260
<i>She comes up with</i>
<i>the craziest things,</i>
<i>oh, my gosh.</i>

1:11:10.460 --> 1:11:14.820
<i>But I think what I love most </i>
<i>about M3gan is that,</i>

1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:16.820
<i>when she looks at me,</i>
<i>it'’s like...</i>

1:11:18.170 --> 1:11:20.440
<i>I'’m the only thing</i>
<i>that matters to her.</i>

1:11:21.820 --> 1:11:23.550
<i>Kind of the way Mom used to.</i>

1:11:23.750 --> 1:11:25.250
[David] <i>Look at that face.</i>

1:11:25.450 --> 1:11:27.940
<i>That kid'’s not just surviving, </i>
<i>she'’s thriving.</i>

1:11:28.140 --> 1:11:30.010
<i>Now, imagine </i>
<i>what a toy like M3gan could do</i>

1:11:30.210 --> 1:11:33.290
<i>for hundreds of thousands </i>
<i>of kids all across the world.</i>

1:11:33.490 --> 1:11:35.630
<i>Even the ones </i>
<i>who don'’t have dead parents.</i>

1:11:37.630 --> 1:11:39.570
- [Cady] I want to see M3gan now!
- [clattering]

1:11:39.770 --> 1:11:41.570
Okay, Cady, look,
I know that you'’re upset,

1:11:41.770 --> 1:11:43.610
but there are ways
that we can work through this--

1:11:43.810 --> 1:11:45.090
Oh, my God. Okay.

1:11:45.290 --> 1:11:46.580
Cady, that'’s enough.
Stop that right now.

1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:47.960
Stop it. Let go!

1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:49.330
[gasps]

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.100
[Lydia] Cady.

1:11:54.860 --> 1:11:57.000
It'’s okay.
Could you give us a minute?

1:12:03.210 --> 1:12:05.560
[sighs]I'’m sorry.
I didn'’t mean it.

1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.670
It'’s just,
I get so crazy without M3gan.

1:12:09.870 --> 1:12:11.810
She always knows
just what to say.

1:12:12.010 --> 1:12:14.190
You made her real good,
Aunt Gemma.

1:12:15.220 --> 1:12:16.880
Can you let me see her?

1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:18.540
Just for, like, ten minutes?

1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:20.890
Cady, I don'’t think
that'’s a good idea.

1:12:21.090 --> 1:12:24.020
But if something'’s broke,
you don'’t just throw it away.
You fix it, right?

1:12:26.060 --> 1:12:28.620
Why did you do this if you were
just going to
take her away from me?

1:12:28.820 --> 1:12:31.380
Because I thought
she would help.She does help!

1:12:31.580 --> 1:12:33.210
When M3gan'’s around,
I don'’t feel like this.

1:12:33.410 --> 1:12:35.210
But you should feel like this.

1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:39.520
Cady, you lost your parents.

1:12:41.210 --> 1:12:45.870
The worst thing
that could'’ve happened
to you in this world happened.

1:12:46.870 --> 1:12:48.640
And it is so unfair,

1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:52.950
and there is nothing
anyone can say
to make sense of it.

1:12:53.150 --> 1:12:54.540
Not even M3gan.

1:12:55.540 --> 1:12:57.230
I am so sorry.

1:12:57.430 --> 1:12:59.550
I should'’ve talked to you
about what happened.

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:02.450
I didn'’t know what to say,
so I did the only thing
I knew how to do.

1:13:02.650 --> 1:13:05.280
But she'’s not a solution,
she'’s just a distraction.

1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:07.760
I can'’t promise you

1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:11.280
that these feelings
you'’re feeling
are ever gonna go away.

1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:15.080
But I can promise you
that you'’ll get through it.

1:13:16.010 --> 1:13:17.280
We both will.

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:21.600
I just wish
I could see them again.

1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:23.600
Yeah.

1:13:25.810 --> 1:13:27.610
I do too.

1:13:27.810 --> 1:13:29.920
You know I made a promise
to your mom

1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:33.270
that if anything happens,
I would be there for you.

1:13:34.230 --> 1:13:37.790
You are all
that matters to me now.

1:13:40.270 --> 1:13:42.070
Let'’s just go home, okay?

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:45.350
But what about M3gan?

1:13:45.550 --> 1:13:48.150
What about the launch?

1:13:48.350 --> 1:13:50.110
[David] <i>I don'’t even know</i>
<i>what I'’m looking at.</i>

1:13:50.310 --> 1:13:51.910
I mean, we'’ve been touting this

1:13:52.110 --> 1:13:54.810
as the single biggest
product release
of the 21st century.

1:13:55.010 --> 1:13:56.980
Right now,
it looks like an AA meeting.

1:13:57.180 --> 1:14:00.050
[Shelley] Well, I only
invited the staff. You said
it was an online launch.

1:14:00.250 --> 1:14:01.640
You cannot be serious.

1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:04.090
Shelley,
you need to fill this atrium.

1:14:04.290 --> 1:14:06.580
Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people?

1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:08.820
[David] No!
You need to fill this space.

1:14:09.020 --> 1:14:13.450
There shouldn'’t be any ambiguity
over what a historic occasion
this is.

1:14:13.650 --> 1:14:14.930
[Kurt] Yeah.

1:14:15.130 --> 1:14:16.490
And, you know,
I think it'’d be really cool

1:14:16.690 --> 1:14:18.940
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff.

1:14:19.140 --> 1:14:21.490
What? No,
I don'’t want any kids onstage.

1:14:21.690 --> 1:14:24.670
No, I mean, but maybe
if we could get some
little kids that--

1:14:24.870 --> 1:14:28.190
I mean, not like a whole lot.
It'’s just to get a sense of,
um--

1:14:28.390 --> 1:14:31.670
Well, '’cause you know,
that music video
from Michael Jackson.

1:14:31.870 --> 1:14:35.440
You know what you could do,
Kurt, that would really
benefit this discussion?

1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:37.300
Is if you could head out
those double doors,

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:40.960
take the elevator
to the first floor,
and get me a kombucha.

1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:42.990
Could you do that?Sure.

1:14:44.650 --> 1:14:46.680
And where the hell is Gemma?

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:52.030
[chattering]

1:14:55.140 --> 1:14:56.320
Elsie, call Tess.

1:14:56.520 --> 1:14:58.730
[Elsie] <i>One second.</i>[line rings]

1:14:58.930 --> 1:15:02.390
[Tess] <i>Hey, I'’ve been trying </i>
<i>to call you. David is flipping </i>
<i>out. Where are you?</i>

1:15:02.590 --> 1:15:04.500
I'’m with Cady.
I'’m taking her home.

1:15:04.700 --> 1:15:05.670
<i>Oh, God. Is she okay?</i>

1:15:05.870 --> 1:15:08.160
Yeah. She'’s fine.

1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:11.400
Listen,
regardless of what we find,

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:13.750
and even if what we'’re saying
is hypothetical,

1:15:13.950 --> 1:15:16.330
we know enough
not to go through with this,
right?

1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:18.890
<i>I think that'’s the smart move.</i>

1:15:19.090 --> 1:15:20.720
[Gemma] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>So tell David</i>
<i>whatever you need to.</i>

1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:22.760
<i>Tell him one of her servos </i>
<i>stopped working.</i>

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:25.930
<i>Break something if you have to. </i>
<i>Just do not let her </i>
<i>out of the lab.</i>

1:15:29.450 --> 1:15:31.870
[electronic voice]
<i>Whatever you say, Gem.</i>
<i>You'’re the boss.</i>

1:15:34.870 --> 1:15:36.530
Okay.
I'’ll call you when I get home.

1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:51.440
[typing]

1:15:55.620 --> 1:15:57.930
I don'’t know how you'’re not
throwing up
from looking at that.

1:15:58.130 --> 1:15:59.720
I'’m pacing myself.

1:16:01.380 --> 1:16:03.350
Wait, stop. Go back.

1:16:03.550 --> 1:16:06.770
That line of code,
"call intercept,"
what does that mean?

1:16:06.970 --> 1:16:08.560
[Tess] That'’s my phone number.[beeps]

1:16:10.980 --> 1:16:13.910
What just happened?
What'’d you click?I-I didn'’t do anything.

1:16:14.110 --> 1:16:15.360
It--I--

1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:17.120
[typing]
