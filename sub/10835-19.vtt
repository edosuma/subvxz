00:03.128 --> 00:04.212
(gasping)
Surprise!

00:04.254 --> 00:05.547
Donna?!

00:05.589 --> 00:07.007
You've got to open
a store in L.A., Donna.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.467
Someone with bipolar disorder

00:08.509 --> 00:10.678
needs to maintain balance.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.472
I reserved a hotel suite.
I'll be staying there
until Mom comes home.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.724
It's probably best
that I pass on the baton.
Adoption?

00:15.766 --> 00:19.227
NAOMI:
Liam's a psychopath
and an awesome kisser.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.395
Donna, what's going on?

00:20.437 --> 00:21.814
David and I are separated.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.703
Okay, Silver, hurry up and
finish that geometry homework.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.413
Sammy, I need you to turn off
SpongeBob and drink your juice.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.208
I don't like it.
It has bugs.
What?!

00:41.249 --> 00:42.877
(chuckles): Those aren't
bugs, that's pulp.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.378
Okay, uh, time check?

00:44.419 --> 00:45.754
Uh, 8:18.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.881
Oh, Sammy's lunch.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.047
Oh, I got it.
Already made.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.842
A turkey sandwich, granola bar,

00:49.884 --> 00:51.343
and a sticker
that says "I love you."

00:51.385 --> 00:52.594
Mommy, I drunk the bugs.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.513
Oh, you're the best.
I love you.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.890
Okay. Donna, can you...?

00:55.931 --> 00:57.140
Yup, taking him to the car.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.433
Come on, Sammy.
Come on, buddy.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.602
All right, here you go.
Geometry homework.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.396
That last problem set
was a killer.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.898
If you get inspired,

01:03.939 --> 01:05.440
feel free to take a hack
at the tetrahedron.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.984
Nice try.

01:07.026 --> 01:09.361
Pretty soon, you'll be handing
in your homework yourself.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.905
Mm-hmm.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.113
You think you're
going to be ready

01:12.155 --> 01:13.407
to go back to school next week?

01:13.448 --> 01:15.951
Sure. I guess.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.244
Bye.

HARRY:
Hey, you sure you want
to sell this stuff?

01:33.343 --> 01:36.179
I mean, honestly, Deb, there are
some real treasures in here.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.305
(gasps)

01:37.347 --> 01:39.098
Big Mouth Billy Bass.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.142
No, we cannot sell
Big Mouth Billy Bass.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.062
Let's hope we can.
Come on.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.482
We'll put a pin in it.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.359
We will not put
a pin in it. We will put

01:49.401 --> 01:51.070
a price tag on it and sell it.
It's junk, Harry.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.447
Oh, if it's junk, then why are
we trying to sell it?

01:53.488 --> 01:56.575
Ah, and therein lies the paradox
of the yard sale.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.285
Hand me the singing fish,
my love.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.663
HARRY: Hey, Annie.
You shouldn't have.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.916
Yeah, well, I didn't.
It's for Naomi.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.208
She's giving me
a ride to school.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.251
I just wanted to say bye.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.673
Wow. You guys are
really making a go

02:11.715 --> 02:13.216
of this whole
friendship thing, huh?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.886
Yup. I have decided that I
want to be a girls' girl.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.179
I don't know if you noticed,
but I didn't have

02:18.221 --> 02:20.223
many girlfriends
back in Kansas.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.101
And I was finally
starting to make some here,

02:22.142 --> 02:24.185
and then I just got lost
in having a boyfriend.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.521
So now...
You're ready
to be a girls' girl.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.689
Bring on the
Barbie dolls.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.524
(horn toots)
Hey!

02:29.566 --> 02:30.818
Bye, Mom.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.402
Have fun.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.991
Aah!

02:40.160 --> 02:42.579
Oh, my God, who left all that
junk in your front yard?

02:42.621 --> 02:43.956
Seriously, you should file
a police report.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.791
No, no, it's, um...

02:45.833 --> 02:47.584
We finally sold
our house in Kansas,

02:47.626 --> 02:49.544
and we got all
this stuff to get rid of.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.379
So, uh, we're having
a yard sale.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.715
Gross... ly awesome!

02:53.757 --> 02:54.716
(chuckles)

02:54.758 --> 02:56.551
Um, here.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.886
Oh...
It...

02:57.928 --> 02:58.929
It's fine.
Uh, go ahead.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.388
Keep putting on your lipstick.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.974
You made me coffee?

03:02.016 --> 03:04.351
Yeah, it's a pretty color on
you. It was really no problem.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.020
Sweet pea goes good
with... my eyes.

03:06.061 --> 03:06.937
(both laugh)

03:08.814 --> 03:10.649
Oh! Is that a foosball table?

03:10.691 --> 03:13.485
Yeah, I used to be
really big into foosball.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.821
Seriously? Me, too!

03:15.863 --> 03:17.906
I used to play all the time
with Bella Cruise.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.575
I swear, I was, like, the
foosball champ of St. Bart's.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.702
We'll have to play.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.704
I'd love to.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.830
Oh.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.081
I hope it's not cold.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.249
It's perfect.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.377
I don't like my coffee
too hot, anyway.

Oh.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.225
Hey, Liam.
Where you going,
White Rabbit?

03:45.266 --> 03:47.435
Uh, to, to class.
I've got English.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.937
Oh, yeah? You want to be
an English teacher?

03:48.979 --> 03:50.981
Teach?
Yeah.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.482
I mean,
say you go to class,

03:52.524 --> 03:54.109
maybe you get really
into it, right?

03:54.151 --> 03:55.610
Then what?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.571
You head to college,
and become an English major.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.531
Okay. And then?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.616
You graduate with
a useless degree

04:01.658 --> 04:03.618
that only qualifies you
to teach English

04:03.660 --> 04:05.620
at some lame high school
to snot-nosed kids

04:05.662 --> 04:07.622
who'd rather be at the beach.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.958
What are you saying?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.292
I'm saying, let's go the beach.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.046
Liam! Quelle surprise.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.463
Hiya, Naomi.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.507
Did I overhear you
trying to get Ethan to cut?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.259
Because he won't, so stop
trying to corrupt him.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.886
Naomi...
Don't worry, I got this.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.846
No, I got this.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.806
Sure, man.
Let's go to the beach.
Cool.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.808
See ya, Naomi.

with you two,

04:28.894 --> 04:30.771
(bell rings)

04:32.522 --> 04:34.816

to go to your lawyer's?

04:34.858 --> 04:36.985
Ooh...

04:37.027 --> 04:39.320
Oh-ho-ho, no fries for you.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.281

are a vegetable.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.784

at 4:00, but, um...

04:43.825 --> 04:45.953
mmm, but you don't
have to come.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.749
But hey, here, I brought you
some real vegetables: kale.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.253
Mmm, it's really not going
to be that exciting.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.172
I just have to pick up a lot of
brochures-- and kale, really?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.174
Yeah, vitamin A helps support
the fetal immune functions.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.135
And, no, I don't want
excitement, but, you know,

05:01.176 --> 05:04.012
I want to, you know, lend moral
support if and when it's needed.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.346
Okay, sounds good.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.016
Um, do I really
have to eat this?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.935
Loaded with vitamin C,
which helps the baby

05:09.977 --> 05:12.104
build strong bones
and teeth.
That's it.

committed to memory.

prenatal vitamins?
Yes, Navid.

you know?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.059

for a year?"

seemed... unmei.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.567
"Meant to be."

06:40.608 --> 06:42.361
Then, one year

turned into two years, that
became three and four and...

09:50.590 --> 09:51.883
Just put on a smile

09:51.925 --> 09:52.926
and act like nothing happened.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.095
And when they ask

09:55.136 --> 09:56.930
what I've been up
to for the last month?

09:56.971 --> 09:59.349
I don't know, um...

09:59.391 --> 10:01.268
Tell them you've
taken up gardening.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.769
Or, uh...

10:02.810 --> 10:04.687
Tell them you've been reading
Jane Austen.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.108
And then just smile.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.110
And dare them
to give you any trouble.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.612
All right?

10:12.653 --> 10:14.864
Just never let them
see you sweat.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.908
"You got to fake it
till you make it."

10:16.950 --> 10:18.868
Any more platitudes?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.329
"Keep a stiff upper lip."

10:21.371 --> 10:24.291
And, uh, "turn the other cheek."

10:24.332 --> 10:26.293
Okay, that sounds
kind of tricky.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.087
Keeping a stiff upper lip
while turning the other cheek.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.088
(laughing)

10:32.757 --> 10:34.426
But I'll try.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.177
Atta-girl.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.646
A hundred and fifty dollars?!

10:46.687 --> 10:49.232
Harry, what on earth?

10:49.274 --> 10:51.568
(Scottish accent):
Seems a fair price to me.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.778
Yech, get that horrible thing
off your head.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.322
What horrible thing?

10:55.363 --> 10:58.741
Me hair? You think me
ginger hair is horrible?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.994
Stop. Harry, honestly,

11:01.035 --> 11:04.164
who's going to buy
a Big Mouth Billy Bass for $150?

11:04.205 --> 11:07.000
Someone getting
a very good bargain.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.128
(normal voice): Oh, you know, I
forgot to tell you this.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.465
I heard the weirdest thing
at the school board meeting.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.467
Could you take off the hat?

11:15.509 --> 11:17.427
It's really hard
to take you seriously.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.597
Uh, apparently,

11:20.639 --> 11:24.100
Charles Clark is being sued
for sexual harassment.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.519
What? Naomi's dad?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.228
Yeah. By Carole Ranson.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.105
Her daughter goes to West Bev.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.815
Portia Ranson.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.484
Whoa, poor Naomi.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.194
"Poor Naomi" what?

11:34.235 --> 11:36.112
HARRY:
Uh, well...

11:36.154 --> 11:37.989
Sweetheart, you're going
to hear it anyway.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.325
Uh, probably best
you hear it from me.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.203
Dad, what?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.872
Naomi's dad is being sued
for sexual harassment.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.748
(sighs)

11:47.790 --> 11:49.876
Oh, my God.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.378
Poor Naomi.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.047
She's really going
to need a friend now.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.721
DONNA: I'm
telling you, she is

12:02.763 --> 12:04.558
the crème de la crème
de la crème.

12:04.599 --> 12:07.018
Okay, you're honestly telling me
that you think this

12:07.060 --> 12:08.395
alleged psychic...

12:08.436 --> 12:09.563
Shh! Shh! Shh!

12:09.604 --> 12:13.567
Madame Flanagan is
going to help you decide

12:13.608 --> 12:15.360
whether you should stay
in L.A. or not?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.028
Come on, I know this seems

12:17.070 --> 12:19.155
kooky, but it's
worth a shot.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.074
Madame Flanagan is very good.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.076
She's the one that told
Angelina to adopt.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.245
Oh, my God, that means nothing!
Well...

12:25.286 --> 12:27.414
she also predicted the return
of high-waisted jeans.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.749
I'm serious, like,
way back in 2006.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.586
Kel, jump on board.
It's going to be fun.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.170
Hmm.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.005
WOMAN:
Madame Flanagan
will see you now.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.426
Here or Japan?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.219
Right. So David's point is

12:41.261 --> 12:43.221
everything's going
so well for us in Japan--

12:43.263 --> 12:45.265
his career is thriving,
my career is thriving--

12:45.306 --> 12:47.100
so why rock the boat?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.560
Why, indeed?

12:48.602 --> 12:50.103
Because I miss it here.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.731
And I want to raise
my daughter here.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.108
But if I stay in L.A.,

12:55.149 --> 12:56.775
I don't know how my marriage
will survive.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.070
And if I move back to Japan,
I'll be unhappy

12:59.112 --> 13:01.615
and I don't know if my marriage
will survive-- but I want

13:01.656 --> 13:03.450
my marriage
to survive, but...

13:03.491 --> 13:04.951
I don't know.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.286
At what cost, do you know?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.290
Has your right foot
been bothering you?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.751
I'm getting
a vision of a foot.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.129
My right foot? No.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.672
Hmm...

13:17.714 --> 13:20.425
Maybe that was for someone else.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.469
Anyway,

13:22.510 --> 13:26.097
it sounds like you have
an important decision to make.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.515
Yes! Yes, I do!

13:29.309 --> 13:32.562
I'm sensing skepticism
from your friend.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.855
Oh, don't
worry about her.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.775
Tell me what to do.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.319
I'm afraid I can't do that.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.279
I will tell you this.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.156
Look for a sign.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.659
What kind of sign?

13:45.700 --> 13:47.410
A sign of what to do.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.911
(Kelly snickers)

13:50.037 --> 13:51.830
Sorry.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.585
You...

13:56.753 --> 13:59.339
I'm getting a
vision of a man.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.592
You're going to meet a man.

14:02.634 --> 14:03.884
KELLY:
Uh... uh...

14:03.926 --> 14:06.763
thanks for that, but, um,

14:06.805 --> 14:09.641
I'm really not looking
for a man right now.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.519
Looking or not, he's coming.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.646
A very handsome man...

14:14.688 --> 14:16.815
with a six-pack.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.026
Uh, well...
that's good to know.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.570
Thanks a lot,
Madame Flanagan.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.197
Uh, but... Donna.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.949
Donna!

14:26.991 --> 14:28.451
Now!
Thanks.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.833
♪ ♪

14:39.629 --> 14:41.339
DEBBIE:
Thank you.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.590
Enjoy that guitar.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.137
NAOMI:
Hey, Principal Wilson.
Hi.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.640
Adorable fish. Is that one
of your yard sale items?

14:50.682 --> 14:52.475
(whispers):
No, not really.
(whispers): Yes.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.727
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.
Hi.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.479
(groans)

14:56.521 --> 14:58.523
Hey. You came.
Hi.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.149
Yeah, I told you I'd swing by.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.109
Cool. You want to play
some foosball?

15:02.151 --> 15:04.529
Sure.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.699
So... how are you doing?

15:07.741 --> 15:08.867
Fine.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.785
This morning was a little rough.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.036
My manicurist

15:12.078 --> 15:14.664
wreaked havoc on
my cuticles... ugh!

15:14.706 --> 15:17.041
It's fine, though.
I totally keyed her car.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.167
(ball clatters)
Yes!

15:18.209 --> 15:20.670
(chuckles)

15:20.712 --> 15:22.714
Ugh! My parents
are driving me crazy.

15:22.756 --> 15:23.923
Oh, yeah?
Hmm.

15:25.884 --> 15:29.136
Um, how's your dad,
by the way?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.680
Funny you should ask.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.849
He called me today.
He wants to come by my hotel

15:32.891 --> 15:34.851
for a chat.
Oh, yeah?

15:34.893 --> 15:37.019
Shot on goal!
(laughs)

15:37.061 --> 15:38.646
You are good.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.440
Yes, I am.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.902
So, hey, if you want to,
you know, call me later...

15:43.943 --> 15:45.695
Um...

15:45.737 --> 15:47.697
You know, after your dad leaves.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.450
Yeah, right. Sure.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.201
She shoots, she scores!

15:52.243 --> 15:53.620
(laughs)
Yay!

15:56.748 --> 15:58.082
Dan and Kate have been

15:58.124 --> 15:59.208
married for three years.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.127
Hey, five years
or longer.

16:02.587 --> 16:06.382
Okay, Matt and Rachel have
"a spacious house

16:06.424 --> 16:09.510
with a huge, grassy yard,
but no one to play in it."

16:09.552 --> 16:10.845
Sad.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.097
Psychologically manipulative,
don't you think?
Yeah.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.475
I don't want my baby to grow
up with psychologically
manipulative people.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.894
I hear you. You want a nice,
down-to-earth couple.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.855
Yeah. Two people
who are equal partners,

16:20.897 --> 16:22.106
with good communication.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.942
Who like to laugh
and are warm and loving.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.402
Mm-hmm, exactly.
Is that too much to ask?
No.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.405
I just wish that
kindergarten teacher Laura

16:29.447 --> 16:31.282
would break up with
motorcycle-riding Jimmy,

16:31.324 --> 16:34.702
and hook up with
animal-lover Josh...

16:34.744 --> 16:36.412
who couldn't
possibly be happy

16:36.454 --> 16:37.789
with plastic surgery Pam.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.791
Oh, hoo-hoo...

16:39.833 --> 16:41.751
"Hoo-hoo" what?

16:41.793 --> 16:43.503
That was a big kick.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.838
Yeah?

16:44.879 --> 16:46.422
Do you want to feel?

16:46.464 --> 16:48.174
Yeah.
Okay.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.092
Whoa-ho...

16:52.595 --> 16:54.931
You feel that?
Yeah.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.558
That's a definite "no"
for plastic surgery Pam.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.768
I read somewhere that

16:58.810 --> 17:00.603
the more active the baby,

17:00.645 --> 17:01.980
the more likely it's a boy.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.314
That's an old wives' tale.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.148
Well, are you carrying
high or low?
Navid.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.651
Well, high is supposed
to be a girl

17:06.693 --> 17:08.444
and I think low
is supposed to be...
Stop!

17:08.486 --> 17:11.739
I don't want to know
the sex of the baby, okay?

17:11.781 --> 17:14.450
I don't even want the baby
to even have a sex.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.994
I don't want to think
of the baby being a real kid

17:17.036 --> 17:18.579
or a real person.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.123
Someone that I'm going
to have to give up, okay?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.584
Okay.
Okay.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.045
All right.
Victoria and Gabe.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.341
(thunder rumbling)

17:34.178 --> 17:35.262
Check it out.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.639
Another Japanese
restaurant.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.599
That's got to be some
sort of sign, right?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.309
I don't know.
The last Japanese restaurant

17:40.351 --> 17:42.311
we saw had a stop sign
in front of it,

17:42.353 --> 17:44.271
which could mean
don't go back to Japan.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.649
You're right.
I was being sarcastic.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.234
I was pretending
not to notice.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.945
But wait, it's also
raining in Beverly Hills,

17:50.987 --> 17:52.822
which it never does,
so maybe that's a sign.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.949
Okay, Donna, uh,
I hate to be rude,

17:54.991 --> 17:57.577
but Madame Flanagan?
Come on!

17:57.618 --> 18:00.246
The woman saw
a vision of a foot.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.665
Yeah, but she also
saw a vision of you

18:02.707 --> 18:04.417
with a handsome,
six-pack man.
(scoffs)

18:04.458 --> 18:07.211
Well, then she is good.
If she saw me with a man,

18:07.253 --> 18:09.630
then she is seeing
way into the future.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.841
I mean, between
taking care of Silver,

18:11.883 --> 18:13.133
and taking care of Sammy,

18:13.175 --> 18:14.761
and keeping up
with my job...

18:14.802 --> 18:16.763
You've got to take
care of yourself.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.056
You know how
they always say,

18:18.097 --> 18:19.974
"Put your oxygen
mask on first

18:20.016 --> 18:21.183
before you assist others."

18:21.225 --> 18:24.353
Okay, but a man
is not an oxygen mask.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.313
I mean, he's going
to have needs.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.609
He's going to want
attention and time...
Whoa...

18:29.650 --> 18:32.194
No one's talking
about a husband here.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.030
A husband is
a beer belly.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.075
I'm talking about
a hot, six-pack fling.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.618
You know what?

18:38.659 --> 18:41.161
We should get a sitter
and go out tonight.
Go where?

18:41.203 --> 18:43.330
Well, someplace fun,
someplace cool,

18:43.372 --> 18:45.750
someplace we can both
let off some steam.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.209
Okay, that
sounds like fun.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.795
Let's do it.
Oh, yay.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.547
Where would one go
to blow off steam?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.967
Uh, how should I know?
I live in Japan, remember?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.217
Um, oh, wait. Hi.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.594
DONNA:
Ooh, excuse me.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.137
Okay, this is
a weird question,

18:58.178 --> 19:00.556
but we're looking for
someplace to go out tonight.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.224
Do you have
any suggestions?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.143
Oh, what do you think?
On a Saturday night?

19:04.184 --> 19:05.561
Truck Stop's a good time.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.064
Ooh, Truck Stop,
here we come.

19:08.106 --> 19:08.982
(laughter)

19:10.274 --> 19:11.609
Thanks!
Thanks!

19:37.093 --> 19:39.553
What do you mean,
I have to leave the hotel?

19:39.595 --> 19:41.430
Well, for my image
I need to be seen

19:41.472 --> 19:42.932
as a family man right now.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.852
See, I'm being sued.
Sued for what?

19:45.893 --> 19:47.603
Well, Carole Ranson...

19:47.645 --> 19:49.438
Oh, God, Portia's mom?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.482
Why would she be suing you?

19:51.524 --> 19:55.111
Sh-She's claiming falsely
that I sexually harassed her.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.613
What?!

19:57.655 --> 19:59.281
Oh, my God, Dad,
what's wrong with you?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.658
I didn't do it.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.618
But I need us to present
a unified front

20:02.660 --> 20:04.411
as a family.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.622
Plus, it's illegal for you to be
living here on your own.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.124
And I'm going to be
pretty scrutinized

20:08.166 --> 20:10.459
over the next few weeks, so I
need you to come home with me.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.919
Wait, so let me
get this straight.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.462
I'm being punished
because of your screw-up?

20:13.504 --> 20:16.340
Pack your things, Naomi.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.134
No.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.178
You can't make me.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.472
I'll tell Gail
about the real estate lady.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.641
I already told her.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.185
And she's forgiven me.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.937
I'm not paying for another night
in this hotel.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.261
I'll order for us. Excuse me.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.429
What can I get you?

21:03.470 --> 21:06.432
Can we get two
Dirty Girl Scouts, please?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.769
They have California
rolls here.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.437
Do you think maybe
that's a sign I should

21:11.478 --> 21:12.605
split my time
between Japan...

21:12.646 --> 21:14.774
Okay. You're right.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.442
No more obsessing over signs.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.485
We'll just obsess over the fling

21:18.527 --> 21:20.821
that you're
going to have.
Okay, what do you want me to do?

21:20.863 --> 21:22.281
Find some cute guy
and ask him

21:22.322 --> 21:24.075
to lift up his shirt
so I can see his abs?

21:24.117 --> 21:27.286
No. You don't ask.

21:27.327 --> 21:30.164
Wait, actually, there's
not that many guys here.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.917
Uh, you know what?

21:32.959 --> 21:35.795
You're kind of right.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.547
Uh, Donna?

21:38.589 --> 21:39.548
Hmm?

21:39.590 --> 21:42.218
Um, do you think we...

21:42.260 --> 21:44.470
are at a... l-lesbian bar?

21:44.511 --> 21:45.805
No.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.640
It's just L.A.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.601
Oh, my God, we're
totally at a lesbian bar!
Yeah.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.646
How could those girls
send us to a lesbian bar?
I don't know.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.482
Oh... it's 'cause we had
our arms around each other.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.484
(both laugh)

21:58.525 --> 21:59.860
Two Dirty Girl Scouts.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.405
Cheers.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.493
You want to dance?

22:07.534 --> 22:09.328
Uh, only if you've
got a six-pack.

22:09.369 --> 22:12.832
Well, to find that out,
you're gonna have to
get me a lot drunker.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.251
(laughs)
Come on.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.510
Oh, hey, Liam.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.262
Oh. Hey, Naomi.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.185
What is up with him?

22:32.226 --> 22:33.560
He acts like we haven't
been screwing like rabbits

22:33.602 --> 22:34.687
for the past week and a half.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.354
Mm.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.815
Did I tell you I ran
into him at Shang Hau?

22:37.857 --> 22:38.774
We went in the bathroom and...

22:38.816 --> 22:40.567
Oh. Enough.
(laughs)

22:40.609 --> 22:42.778
Agreed. It is
enough already.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.362
(groans)
Seriously.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.699
I mean, he's, like, hot,
and then he's cold,

22:46.740 --> 22:48.242
and then he's
really hot again.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.286
Whatever, I'm
over it, seriously.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.205
I don't want to be
some booty call.

22:52.246 --> 22:55.249
I'm not the type of girl you
run into at a Chinese restaurant

22:55.291 --> 22:56.750
and take into a bathroom.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.085
Anymore.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.546
I have much more
self-respect than that.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.715
Well, right on, sister!

23:02.756 --> 23:04.050
Here are your fries.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.218
Thank you.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.845
So, how was your dad?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.224
Uh, fine.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.725
Mm, same old loser.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.227
(chuckles)

23:14.268 --> 23:16.562
God, these are
really good fries.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.439
Like, crazy delicious good.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.399
Yep, they are good.

23:21.441 --> 23:24.278
Your dad's a disgusting pervert.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.780
I hope my mother takes him
for all he's worth.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.615
How dare you!

23:28.657 --> 23:31.409
You can't blame Naomi
for something that her dad did

23:31.451 --> 23:33.787
o-or didn't do.
Oh, please,

23:33.829 --> 23:35.831
the guy's a scumbag.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.542
You knew?

23:38.584 --> 23:40.127
You knew about my dad?

23:40.169 --> 23:42.963
I... I-I just heard yesterday.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.631
So you knew today
at the yard sale.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.509
I-I'm sorry. I...

23:47.551 --> 23:49.636
I can't believe people are
talking about my dad, about me,

23:49.678 --> 23:50.721
and you didn't
even say anything.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.183
Some friend.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.812

24:20.500 --> 24:23.545
No. No, no, no.
No. We'll
totally be back.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.755
Promise?
Yeah.
Promise?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.840
Of course--
this is just
what we needed.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.301
Come on, let's go.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.511
Okay, have another
Dirty Girl Scout for me.
Okay, be careful.

24:31.553 --> 24:35.473
(slurring):
I'm just saying that Alyssa
was definitely into you.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.310
Oh, are you jealous?

24:37.351 --> 24:39.728
Of course--
you came with me.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.856
If I'd known you were
gonna be such a fickle date,

24:42.898 --> 24:44.984
I would have-ve...

24:45.025 --> 24:46.277
Donna?

24:49.322 --> 24:52.658
It's exactly how I imagined it.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.910
And look.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.163
The sign.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.497
KELLY: Looks like
someone's moving back.

24:59.539 --> 25:01.334
Oh!

25:09.675 --> 25:11.885
Okay.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.263
Uh-huh.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.723
Yes, I know when checkout is.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.643
Thank you for
reminding me again.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.645
Okay.

25:21.687 --> 25:22.980
(sighs)

25:23.022 --> 25:24.315
(knocking)

25:24.357 --> 25:26.317
Just a minute,
I'm almost done packing.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.734
It's Annie.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.156
What do you want?

25:32.198 --> 25:35.409
Well, I-I just
wanted to apologize.

25:35.451 --> 25:39.955
Um, look, I should've told you
what I heard about your dad.

25:39.997 --> 25:43.083
Just chickened out.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.085
I so badly wanted
to be a girl's girl,

25:45.127 --> 25:47.004
to have real friends,

25:47.046 --> 25:51.675
and I wish that I could
undo what I did or...

25:51.717 --> 25:53.093
(groans):
Oh! Stop.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.470
Stop!

25:54.512 --> 25:56.805
Please, I'm going to be
kicked out of this hotel.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.932
I don't know where
the hell I'm gonna go,

25:58.974 --> 26:01.310
and you talking on
and on and on like that,

26:01.352 --> 26:02.853
it's really giving me
a headache.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.813
The hotel's kicking you out?

26:04.855 --> 26:07.024
My dad says
I have to live at home.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.984
Apparently it doesn't
look good for an alleged

26:09.026 --> 26:11.028
sexual harasser
would-be family man

26:11.070 --> 26:13.531
to have a 16-year-old daughter
living alone in a hotel.

26:13.571 --> 26:16.409
Stay at my house,
as long as you want.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.162
Or, you know, until you decide
what to do about your dad.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.372
(wry chuckle)

26:21.414 --> 26:24.500
Live with you and your
Pollyanna family?

26:24.542 --> 26:26.668
I don't know, I mean,
well, I guess it'd be better

26:26.710 --> 26:28.212
than living with
my dad and his mistress.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.297
I would really like it.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.716
Wait, why? 'Cause you pity me?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.927
No.
Because I don't want
a friendship based on pity.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.679
If we're gonna be friends,

26:37.721 --> 26:40.391
we have to be willing
to be blunt and honest.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.684
We can't walk on eggs
around each other.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.729
(chuckles):
Eggshells.

26:45.771 --> 26:49.024
W-We can't walk on eggshells.
Right.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.526
(laughs):
Thank you.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.195
And you play with
your hair way too much.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.030
God. Sorry, you do.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.865
I mean, I'm just being honest.

26:56.907 --> 26:59.868
Well, then I'm sorry
that I threw the foosball game.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.537
What?

27:01.579 --> 27:03.289
(laughs):
You let me win at...

27:03.330 --> 27:05.416
Oh, there is going
to be a rematch.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.042
And I'm going
to destroy you.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.294
Oh, anytime.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.379
Show no pity-- that's my motto.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.637
Our house is big,

27:19.679 --> 27:21.807
there's a park
around the corner,

27:21.848 --> 27:23.350
huge swing set,

27:23.392 --> 27:24.810
sandboxes.

27:24.851 --> 27:28.063
A jungle gym that looks so cool,
I'm tempted to climb on it.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.733
LESLIE:
Luckily, I only have to
teach two days a week.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.651
And on those days,
I'll be working from home.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.070
I plan to be very hands-on.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.906
I don't want to miss a
minute of this kid's life.

27:37.948 --> 27:39.908
And we both want
to be there for everything.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.577
You know, the smiles,
the diapers,

27:41.619 --> 27:43.120
the crawling, the walking.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.746
GREG:
Building of
tree houses.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.999
He's been talking about this
alleged tree house for years.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.750
I'll believe it
when I see it.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.129
So, it says here
that you have a dog?

27:52.171 --> 27:53.880
Yes. Nina.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.382
She's great with kids.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.759
We've had her seven years.
Yeah.

27:57.801 --> 28:01.555
Well, what if the baby
is allergic?

28:01.597 --> 28:04.600
Oh, well, I mean, of course,
we would prioritize the child.

28:04.642 --> 28:08.312
So you'd just give your dog away
after having it for seven years?

28:08.354 --> 28:10.314
LESLIE:
My parents live

28:10.356 --> 28:13.275
45 minutes away-- I'm
sure they'd take her.

28:13.317 --> 28:14.610
Great.

28:14.652 --> 28:17.154
Seem to have an answer
for everything.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.449
(chuckles)

28:30.334 --> 28:32.752
Ha! Eat it!

28:32.794 --> 28:34.338
Damn it! Oh!

28:34.380 --> 28:36.215
71-70, match point.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.133
All right.

28:39.968 --> 28:40.927
Ah!

28:40.969 --> 28:42.680
71-71! Ha! Yes!

28:42.721 --> 28:45.098
Ooh! Mom, can Naomi spend
the night tonight?

28:45.140 --> 28:46.225
Now you're
gonna die.
Sure.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.601
Now you're
gonna die.
Hey, Naomi.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.478
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh!

28:49.520 --> 28:52.606
Oh! No! No, no, no, no!

28:52.648 --> 28:55.067
(groans)
(shouting, laughing)

28:56.485 --> 28:58.445
KELLY:
Donna, are you ready?

28:58.487 --> 29:01.323
You can't be late
to your own opening.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.075
Hey.

29:04.702 --> 29:06.579
Are you okay?

29:07.871 --> 29:10.165
I just got off the
phone with David.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.000
What happened?

29:12.042 --> 29:13.335
(sighs)

29:13.377 --> 29:16.004
I told him about the space.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.131
How perfect it was,

29:18.173 --> 29:20.884
how it was exactly
how I envisioned it,

29:20.926 --> 29:25.013
how I want to come back here,
I want to make a go of it.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.139
And?

29:26.181 --> 29:27.516
And he said

29:27.558 --> 29:29.476
we'll have to figure
out a schedule

29:29.518 --> 29:32.020
to shuttle Ruby
between L.A. and Japan.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.231
Honey.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.859
I guess I always thought
when push came to shove

29:37.901 --> 29:40.195
that he wouldn't
want to lose me.

29:40.237 --> 29:42.531
But if he's willing
to lose me...

29:42.573 --> 29:44.032
Oh, come here.

29:44.074 --> 29:48.579
I just really thought he'd
want to move back here.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.330
I really did.

29:52.082 --> 29:55.043
I thought he'd
choose me over Japan.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.464
I know this is hard,

29:58.505 --> 30:00.549
but I also know...

30:00.591 --> 30:03.636
that you are amazing.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.430
You are...

30:06.472 --> 30:09.224
talented and...

30:09.266 --> 30:11.143
sweet and kind

30:11.184 --> 30:13.437
and wonderful, and you
are gonna get through this,

30:13.479 --> 30:14.980
no matter what.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.316
(crying):
I know.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.359
I know. (sighs)

30:19.401 --> 30:21.403
I will.

30:21.445 --> 30:24.573
Part of me's really excited.

30:24.615 --> 30:29.244
I'll get to raise Ruby here,
and that's what I really want.

30:29.286 --> 30:30.954
And the store is perfect.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.331
(chuckles)

30:32.372 --> 30:35.709
I'm really excited about
signing the lease tonight.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.129
And I'm really excited...

30:39.171 --> 30:41.799
to go celebrate.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.301
Oh, honey.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.012
No, I'm happy.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.264
(voice breaking):
I'm really happy.

30:51.308 --> 30:54.853
(Donna crying)

31:04.488 --> 31:06.573
This cheese is delicious...

31:06.615 --> 31:08.575
just as I foresaw.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.495
Hey, we're gonna be sending
all our friends to your store.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.789
(laughing)
I'm counting
on it! (laughs)

31:13.831 --> 31:14.790
Hey, Ms. Taylor.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.958
Ms. Taylor?
I know.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.001
Hello, Ms. T.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.085
Hi, girls.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.838
Donna, this is
Naomi and Annie.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.964
Hi.
And what's with
the ice pack?

31:23.006 --> 31:24.383
Vicious foosball
tournament.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.634
I kicked her ass.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.093
Cute stuff,
by the way.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.679
Maybe I'll even
find a prom dress.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.389
You didn't
"kick" anything.

31:30.430 --> 31:33.308
She won by one point--
and we're definitely
going to have a rematch.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.477
Oh, you just name the day,
anytime, anyplace.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.854
Excuse me, you guys.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.773
Liam... (scoffs) Wow.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.567
Look at this.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.488
KELLY:
Well, thank you
both for coming.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.990
I'm sure Silver
will appreciate it.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.325
(chuckles):
Hey.
Oh, hi.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.285
Honey,
there you are.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.454
Hey. Dixon, Silver.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.331
How you been?

31:56.373 --> 31:57.416
Fine.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.377
Fine.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.628
Do you want something to eat?

32:01.670 --> 32:02.629
Uh, no, thanks.

32:02.671 --> 32:03.797
Well, it feels
like it's been forever.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.131
What have you been up to?

32:05.173 --> 32:08.719
Well, I've been reading

32:08.761 --> 32:10.345
Sense and Sensibility,
actually.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.680
Hey, there, Silver!
How are you?

32:11.722 --> 32:14.349
Um, can I get you something to
eat? Um, some cheese?

32:14.391 --> 32:17.018
Um, I'm gonna get myself
some cheese.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.144
Appreciate it, though.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.897
Okay, I'll help myself then.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.981
Want some?

32:27.780 --> 32:29.698
Hey, so is it nice
to see everybody?

32:29.740 --> 32:32.075
Does it make you want
to go back to school?

32:32.117 --> 32:34.787
Yep, I'm ready to go back
to school.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.705
Honey, that's great.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.039
Okay.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.710
Ooh, nice flowers.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.378
They're from David.

32:43.420 --> 32:46.131
"Thinking of you."

32:46.172 --> 32:47.633
What does that even mean?

32:47.674 --> 32:51.219
I guess it means
he's thinking of me.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.138
But it's no plane ticket.

32:53.179 --> 32:56.099
Anyway, we're low
on crackers.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.894
The foosball champs decided
to inhale the whole stash

32:58.936 --> 33:00.520
and then the backup stash.

33:00.562 --> 33:03.106
So I'm gonna... just gonna run
around the corner and get some.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.400
No, no, I'll go.
It's your party.

33:05.442 --> 33:06.652
Are you sure?

33:06.693 --> 33:08.069
Yes.
Thanks.

33:17.287 --> 33:18.330
Oh, gosh.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.915
Hey! (chuckles)

33:19.957 --> 33:24.210
Hey. Uh... late-night
munchies or...?

33:24.252 --> 33:26.713
Oh, no, a friend of mine
is opening a store

33:26.755 --> 33:29.048
and ran out
of crackers.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.258
Sure.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.844
What about, what about you?

33:31.885 --> 33:33.971
Oh, just, uh, picking up
a six-pack.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.431
A six-pack?

33:36.473 --> 33:39.100
Yeah, beer is sold
in packs of six.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.769
But don't worry.

33:40.811 --> 33:43.271
I'm only gonna drink... three.

33:43.313 --> 33:44.690
(both chuckle)

33:44.731 --> 33:48.777
Uh, well, uh,
who's gonna drink
the other three?

33:48.819 --> 33:51.947
Uh, no one's called 'em.

33:51.989 --> 33:55.701
I'm... kinda thirsty.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.497
(beeping)

34:09.422 --> 34:10.882
(sighing)

34:23.020 --> 34:25.146
What are you,
the bouncer?

34:25.188 --> 34:28.817
(chuckles)
Yeah, just keeping
out the riffraff.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.819
Navid texted me
that everyone was hanging out.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.987
Thought I'd stop by.

34:32.029 --> 34:33.572
I actually came here with Liam,

34:33.612 --> 34:35.532
but, uh, he seems to have
mysteriously disappeared.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.202
Oh, yeah? Well, head on in.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.829
You're not gonna bounce me?

34:40.871 --> 34:43.164
(chuckles) Uh, not this time.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.250
It's fun. Everybody's here.

34:45.291 --> 34:49.212
It's Dixon, Navid, Adrianna,
Naomi, Annie.

34:49.254 --> 34:53.007
Ooh, two ex-girlfriends.
Sounds a little claustrophobic.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.676
I hear ya.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.844
You, uh,
do you mind if I sit?

34:56.887 --> 34:59.431
As long as you don't
expect me to be

34:59.472 --> 35:01.182
bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.392
Ah, thank God you're not.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.393
Silver?

35:03.435 --> 35:04.269
Yeah?

35:04.310 --> 35:05.687
Are you okay?

35:05.729 --> 35:07.898
Yeah, just, uh, just
getting some fresh air.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.483
Okay.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.785
Hey, Liam,

35:19.826 --> 35:20.869
Got your text.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.537
You know what?

35:22.579 --> 35:24.247
I'm not gonna be
your booty call.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.083
You can't just act
all cold and rude

35:26.124 --> 35:28.085
and then text me,
expect me to show up

35:28.126 --> 35:29.962
and jump your bones
or whatever. Got it?

35:30.003 --> 35:31.296
Okay, got it.

35:42.432 --> 35:46.144
You want to talk about
being claustrophobic?

35:46.185 --> 35:49.564
Try having people monitoring
your mood every second,

35:49.606 --> 35:52.943
offering you crackers like
you're an invalid.

35:52.985 --> 35:54.861
At least you're being
offered crackers.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.405
I got people
always watching me,

35:57.447 --> 35:59.741
and there's no upside.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.910
What do you mean?

36:01.952 --> 36:05.246
Ah, I don't know; it's just,
you... you step off the path

36:05.288 --> 36:08.541
you cut one class, and people
are down your throat.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.960
You cut class?

36:10.002 --> 36:10.961
I might've. Whatever.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.587
(chuckles)

36:12.629 --> 36:15.256
It's not like I'm trying
to be an English teacher
or something.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.635
So, when are you
coming back to school?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.265
I'm not, actually.

36:24.307 --> 36:27.853
I'm enrolling
at St. Clare's.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.313
You're gonna go
to a Catholic school?

36:30.355 --> 36:33.274
It's the only place that would
take me mid-semester.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.694
Went on a tour yesterday.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.821
It's not that bad.

36:37.863 --> 36:42.450
Huh... nah, Dixon
didn't mention anything.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.078
Yeah, well, that's, that's
because Dixon doesn't know yet.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.206
I just decided tonight.

36:52.002 --> 36:54.796
I just need
a fresh start, you know?

36:54.838 --> 36:58.133
Where no one knows me...

36:58.175 --> 37:01.178
where I can just be
who I want to be,

37:01.219 --> 37:03.180
instead of who I was.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.894
You think St. Clare's
has room for me?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.770
It's an all-girls school.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.313
Oh, sounding better
and better.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.523
(laughs)

37:19.487 --> 37:22.365
(both moaning)

37:22.407 --> 37:23.449
I missed you.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.660
I can't put on
your oxygen mask.

37:25.702 --> 37:26.703
What is that?

37:26.745 --> 37:28.788
I mean, I can't
commit right now.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.623
Agreed.
No commitment.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.918
I've never felt less committed
to anything-- wow--

37:32.959 --> 37:33.919
in my entire life.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.628

Did you see Leslie's shoes?

38:41.360 --> 38:44.363
Kind of vain for an English
professor, don't you think?

38:44.405 --> 38:46.950
I don't know how she'll carry
a baby around with those shoes.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.953
I'm sure she has other shoes.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.579
And didn't you think
it was weird

38:51.621 --> 38:53.706
how Greg was all fixated
on building that tree house?

38:53.748 --> 38:56.084
Look, if you didn't like them,
you should have just...

38:56.126 --> 38:58.253
I did. I did like them.

38:58.295 --> 39:01.256
I just... I don't know.

39:01.298 --> 39:06.136
Just all that talking
about schools

39:06.178 --> 39:08.972
and dogs and tree houses.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.853
I kept picturing the kid,
you know,

39:14.894 --> 39:17.689
going to school

39:17.730 --> 39:20.692
and walking the dog...

39:20.733 --> 39:24.112
and climbing in that
stupid tree house.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.823
(sighs)

39:26.865 --> 39:28.783
And once I pictured that kid,
I just...

39:28.825 --> 39:32.453
the idea of giving it up
just got a lot harder.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.747
Hey, you don't, you don't have
to give your baby up

39:34.789 --> 39:35.790
if you don't want to.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.584
Yeah, yeah, I-I do.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.712
I-I've been through this.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.172
I have to be realistic.

39:42.214 --> 39:45.591
My mother doesn't have

39:45.633 --> 39:49.095
the financial means, and I'm 16.

39:49.137 --> 39:53.099
And frankly, we don't have
such a great partnership,

39:53.141 --> 39:54.475
my mother and I.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.936
I don't exactly see us
at baby swim classes together.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.313
What about us?

39:59.939 --> 40:01.566
Could you picture us?

40:01.607 --> 40:04.194
(chuckles)
What do you mean?

40:04.236 --> 40:08.031
I mean me. I mean us.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.742
I could go
to baby swim classes.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.827
I mean, you're
looking for a couple

40:12.869 --> 40:13.995
that communicates,
right?

40:14.037 --> 40:17.165
Laughs and respects one another.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.042
I mean, that's us, right?

40:19.084 --> 40:22.045
A baby lasts a lot longer
than baby swim classes.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.171
Well, I'll be there
a lot longer.

40:23.213 --> 40:24.881
Yeah, until you go away
to college.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.507
I'll go to college nearby.
Who cares?

40:28.385 --> 40:30.970
Hey, hey, the only thing
that matters is that

40:31.012 --> 40:32.931
I'm in love with you.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.140
(chuckles)

40:34.182 --> 40:36.935
I-I've loved you since
we were seven.

40:38.311 --> 40:40.897
And I love your baby, too.

40:40.939 --> 40:45.402
Uh... I love you, too, but...

40:45.443 --> 40:46.861
But nothing, okay?

40:46.903 --> 40:48.947
I want to be with y...

40:48.988 --> 40:51.324
(quietly):
I want to be with you forever.

40:51.366 --> 40:52.867

40:52.909 --> 40:55.370
Come on. What do you mean?

40:55.412 --> 40:57.205
What are you saying,
we should get married?

40:57.247 --> 40:58.664
Yes.
What?!

40:58.706 --> 40:59.665
Yes, yes, uh...

40:59.707 --> 41:01.334
Married, sure.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.377
Let's get married.

41:02.419 --> 41:04.837
Really? No! No!

41:04.879 --> 41:07.048
We love each other, right?

41:07.090 --> 41:08.383
Why not?

41:08.425 --> 41:11.594
Um...
