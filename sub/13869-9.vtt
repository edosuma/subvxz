MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:03.171 --> 00:04.471
but no one noticed...

00:04.505 --> 00:05.539
(growling)

00:05.573 --> 00:06.716
until they began attacking,

00:06.740 --> 00:08.476
coordinating,

00:08.509 --> 00:09.510
evolving.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.379
The animals were mutating,

00:11.412 --> 00:13.223
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.115

00:14.148 --> 00:16.484

PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.618 --> 00:20.354
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:20.388 --> 00:22.690
will be thriving once again.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.593
You cannot exterminate
every animal on the planet

00:25.626 --> 00:27.128
and then repopulate it.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.696
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.729 --> 00:30.531
could be catastrophic,

00:30.564 --> 00:32.342
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.768
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.802 --> 00:36.404
animal experts.

00:36.437 --> 00:39.107
Dariela Marzan, Army Ranger.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.674
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.708 --> 00:43.444
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.477 --> 00:46.647
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.550
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:49.583 --> 00:51.685
for the animals.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.587
Time is running out.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.623
Previously on Zoo...

00:55.656 --> 00:58.592
So you're saying that some
traveling carney grifter

00:58.626 --> 00:59.727
from the 1890s

00:59.760 --> 01:01.362
invented the Triple-Helix.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.531
If we are gonna un-invent
it, we've got to find

01:03.564 --> 01:06.134
descendants from every one of
those animals that he X-rayed.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.568
Shaw gave me the
name of a contact

01:07.601 --> 01:08.836
in the nearest safe zone.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.147
They can take
everyone from town.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.281
Are you sure you
want to do this?

01:11.305 --> 01:12.706
Let's move out!

01:12.740 --> 01:15.143
I remembered what
happened in Boston.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.720
My father injected me
with the ghost gene.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.113
I don't know what kind of father

01:19.147 --> 01:20.714
does that to their own son.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.783
You don't have a
fraction of a clue

01:22.816 --> 01:25.153
what I had to do to survive.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.456
I'm gonna tell him
your little secret.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.124
What secret?

01:30.158 --> 01:32.526
That meeting Jackson
in Uwei as a young man

01:32.560 --> 01:34.395
wasn't a coincidence.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.730
That you knew Robert
Oz long before you met

01:36.764 --> 01:38.299
his son.

team found her caravan.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.936
It was...

01:42.970 --> 01:45.739
well, there was some
sort of animal attack.

01:45.773 --> 01:46.840
What did this?

01:46.874 --> 01:48.309
Your mother.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.311
She killed all of them.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.752
(birds cawing)

whole life healing,

02:14.235 --> 02:16.136
and she killed all these people.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.840
I'm so sorry.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.742
Hey.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.845
Look, a relief worker spoke
to a few of the victims

02:24.878 --> 02:25.879
before they passed.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.282
Your mother had been
self-medicating for weeks,

02:28.316 --> 02:30.284
trying to reduce her symptoms.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.852
Finally, it got so bad

02:31.885 --> 02:34.355
that a few of her neighbors
decided to take her

02:34.388 --> 02:36.400
to a safe zone in Massingir...
They thought the doctors there

02:36.424 --> 02:37.591
might be able to help.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.593
Well, they sure as hell didn't
help, did they?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.830
I know how hard

02:42.863 --> 02:46.234
this must be, but we are one
animal away from the cure.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.769
We need to stay focused.
She's out there; I have to find her.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.538
No, Jackson,
it is too dangerous!

02:50.571 --> 02:52.440
She's my mother.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.808
And what if you do find her?
What then, rafiki?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.479
(closing zippers)

02:59.780 --> 03:00.881
Then I will go with you.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.851

Yeah. Any progress?

03:41.689 --> 03:43.957
No. I'm having
trouble concentrating.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.860
Listen, can, um...

03:46.894 --> 03:49.029

03:49.062 --> 03:51.632
do what people do sometimes

03:51.665 --> 03:54.935

start over?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.705
Yeah. Sure.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.574
Let's... let's move on.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.412
Uh, okay. Yeah.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.648
Um... we still need
one last animal...

04:07.681 --> 04:08.949
I can't even identify it.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.851
And... once I do,
we're still gonna have

04:10.884 --> 04:13.287
to go and track one
down, God knows where.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.756
Well, it's got four legs...
How many things can it be?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.591
About three million.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.594
That's how many quadrupeds
there are on this planet.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.996
See, our mystery animal
is about the size

04:23.030 --> 04:24.865
of a really big lion,

04:24.898 --> 04:26.834
but according to the
bones in its feet,

04:26.867 --> 04:28.736
it walked in a
plantigrade fashion.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.871
Plantigrade, sure.
What's plantigrade?

04:30.904 --> 04:32.406
Feet flat on the ground,

04:32.440 --> 04:34.742
as opposed to digitigrade,
which is up on its toes

04:34.775 --> 04:36.644
like lions do.
This is more like a bear.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.479
Okay,
so we're looking for a bear.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.913
Oh, wait, there's more.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.550
Range of motion of the
mandible is about 120 degrees,

04:42.583 --> 04:44.585
so that makes it
more like a snake.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.455
Also, there's the length
imbalance of the front

04:47.488 --> 04:50.023
and hind legs,
which makes it more like a hyena.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.326
On top of all that,
I got a bunch of spare parts.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.294
I don't know what those are.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.065
So... if by "am I
making any progress,"

04:58.098 --> 05:00.801
you're asking me if I have
any idea what these bones

05:00.834 --> 05:03.804
are trying to tell me,
the answer is a big fat no,

05:03.837 --> 05:07.408
with a...
snake-hyena-bear-lion on top.

05:07.441 --> 05:11.612

bones don't even go together?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.544
says they're from
the same skeleton...

12:48.568 --> 12:52.439
Color, texture...
Well, if we can't identify them,

12:52.472 --> 12:54.808
we're back to chasing storms.
I realize that.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.576
(door closes)

12:56.609 --> 12:58.812
Jackson, oh, my God.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.083
What happened? She was shot.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.885
She...

13:04.918 --> 13:06.820
she mutated.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.263
My father must have
given her the ghost gene

13:16.296 --> 13:17.397
like he did to me.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.333
But I need to know for sure.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.002
(panting)

13:22.035 --> 13:23.436
If he did, she's gonna have

13:23.470 --> 13:25.939
the same mark as me...
A three-point scar.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.879
MITCH: Okay.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.388
(sighs)

13:41.421 --> 13:42.890
(beep)

13:43.556 --> 13:46.459
This light will cause
old scars and injuries

13:46.493 --> 13:48.128
to fluoresce if, uh...

13:48.161 --> 13:49.897
the mark is deep enough.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.867
ABRAHAM: That's...

13:53.901 --> 13:56.203
where she was bitten
by a rhino calf.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.866
(Jackson grunting loudly)

14:28.068 --> 14:29.069
My father did this.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.637
If he wasn't already
dead, I swear...

14:30.670 --> 14:32.672
I'd kill him myself. Jackson,

14:32.705 --> 14:35.208
I understand that you're in
pain, I really do...

14:35.242 --> 14:37.010
Maybe I don't care!

14:37.044 --> 14:38.611
About any of this!

14:38.645 --> 14:41.915
Do you understand?

14:41.949 --> 14:43.216
Jackson.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.353
Maybe you should

14:46.386 --> 14:48.188
listen to Allison
and try to hold on.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.490
JACKSON (mumbling): I can't.
My head...

14:50.523 --> 14:52.225
I don't know how much longer

14:52.259 --> 14:54.327
we're gonna be
able to manage him.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.335
Messed up my bones.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.674
Wait a minute.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.179
Sometimes,
out of chaos comes clarity.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.182
If I'm right about this,
somebody's gonna owe me

15:15.215 --> 15:17.317
a very large,

15:17.350 --> 15:20.287
very cold double martini.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.545
Okay, I know what it is,

15:45.578 --> 15:48.481
but it's insane.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.651
JAMIE: Immortal jellyfish,

15:51.684 --> 15:55.222
ice lizard, earthquake sloth...

15:55.255 --> 15:57.090
They're all insane.
Yeah, well, none of those

15:57.124 --> 15:58.458
are extinct.
ALLISON: What exactly

15:58.491 --> 16:00.060
are you talking about?
The one animal

16:00.093 --> 16:01.594
that we need most

16:01.628 --> 16:04.097
has been extinct
for 14,000 years.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.685
How could Pierce
have experimented

16:16.709 --> 16:17.577
on an extinct animal?
I don't know.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.013
'Cause I can't read
the mind of a guy

16:20.047 --> 16:21.224
who's been dead for 100 years.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.426
Which, right about now,
sounds pretty recent, doesn't it?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.684
Is there a chance

16:24.717 --> 16:28.021
that the saber-toothed tiger still exists?
It's not a tiger,

16:28.055 --> 16:29.132
it's a cat. Oh, for God's sake!

16:29.156 --> 16:30.257
The saber-toothed cat

16:30.290 --> 16:33.026
went extinct during the Ice Age.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.727
That's the Pleistocene era.

16:34.761 --> 16:35.895
What if you're wrong?

16:35.928 --> 16:38.431
If there's even a shadow of a
doubt, we need to pursue it.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.766
She's right.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.668
Oh, great. You too?

16:41.701 --> 16:44.337
If there's a chance...
Any chance at all...

16:44.371 --> 16:48.141
That this animal still exists...
you and I both know

16:48.175 --> 16:51.578
that there's only one
place to find that answer.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.046
No.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.481
I'm sorry. No.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.583
Alison, no. Mitch, I...
I am sorry, but this is our

16:56.616 --> 16:58.218
last shot, and I am taking it.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.354
Trotter, this is Allison Shaw.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.723
We're wheels-up for Helsinki.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.059
Anyone gonna tell me why
we're going to Helsinki?

17:06.093 --> 17:07.569
Because that's where
one of the greatest

17:07.594 --> 17:09.561
cryptozoologists of
our time has chosen

17:09.596 --> 17:11.698
to sit out the
animal armageddon.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.166
And if you don't know
what a cryptozoologist is,

17:14.201 --> 17:16.836
that's a "scientist" who goes
around in search of animals

17:16.868 --> 17:18.405
that may or may not exist.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.173
Like Bigfoot?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.409
Yeah, Bigfoot,
Loch Ness Monster,

17:22.442 --> 17:24.344
Easter Bunny... all that.
Okay, so, we're going

17:24.377 --> 17:25.854
all the way to Helsinki
to meet a quack?

17:25.877 --> 17:27.780
Oh, not just any quack.

17:27.814 --> 17:31.751
This particular quack
is a raging alcoholic,

17:31.784 --> 17:33.753
pathological hypocrite,

17:33.786 --> 17:36.623
a straight-up cradle robber...

17:36.656 --> 17:38.758
and he's also my dad.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.693
(whistles softly)

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
(whinnying)

17:48.401 --> 17:49.869
They're hunting me.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.772
But why?
The group I was working with...

17:52.805 --> 17:54.641
They think some people
have a special gene

17:54.674 --> 17:56.609
that makes the animals
leave them alone.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.645
So, you're saying you
have the opposite?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.480
I don't know.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.383
But I can't talk to my friends
until we get to the safe zone.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.718
Eight blocks. The same distance

18:05.752 --> 18:08.221
Jesus walked to the Crucifixion.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.757
Yeah, well,
hopefully this ends a little better.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.892
I'll draw the horses away,

18:12.925 --> 18:14.527
you get everyone out of here.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.863
You can't outrun a horse.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.866
I can sure as hell try.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.193
It's not there.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.764
(grunting)

19:02.275 --> 19:04.143
You really think
that's gonna help?

19:07.747 --> 19:10.183
You have to tell Jackson
about his father.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.355
I can't.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.590
Abe, I am done with the
secrets and the lies.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.859
I know that you're trying to protect
him, but... I can't

19:19.892 --> 19:21.528
tell him the truth

19:21.561 --> 19:23.763
because it is so much
worse than you know.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.766
Robert Oz is alive and
working for Reiden.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.801
How does it get any
worse than that?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.505
You think you know me.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.443
But I'm not the man
you think you know.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.711
Jackson's mother,

19:38.745 --> 19:41.648
Elizabeth...

19:41.681 --> 19:43.883
When I first met her,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.852
I came into her clinic,

19:45.885 --> 19:48.255
and I told her I had a fever.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.823
When she leaned over me...

19:50.857 --> 19:53.960
I shouted that she'd had
a wasp on her shoulder.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.697
I reached over to brush it away,

19:57.730 --> 20:00.267
and then...

20:02.702 --> 20:04.804
Then what?

20:04.837 --> 20:07.674
I injected her with the needle

20:07.707 --> 20:09.976
that Robert Oz had given me.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.579
Even though Robert
told me it was

20:12.612 --> 20:14.714
an inoculation,
I only believed him

20:14.747 --> 20:17.684
because I needed the money.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.421
I tried to slip out of the
clinic, but Elizabeth

20:21.454 --> 20:23.456
made me stay for dinner.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.563
The guilt I felt
over her kindness

20:30.597 --> 20:33.032
changed something in me.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.668
I promised that I would

20:35.702 --> 20:37.837
protect her and her son

20:37.870 --> 20:39.372
as long as I was able.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.574
But now...

20:43.476 --> 20:47.380
now I know that it
was because of me...

20:47.414 --> 20:49.849
that she's turned
into a monster.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.885
It is because of me she is dead.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.490
It is all because of me.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.461
So, no...

21:02.862 --> 21:06.433
this does not help.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.302
But it does hurt.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.605
And somehow,

21:12.639 --> 21:15.041
that is even better.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.577
(thudding)

21:17.610 --> 21:18.811
(grunting)

21:29.856 --> 21:31.023
(sighs)

21:31.057 --> 21:32.525
I might vomit.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.827
Mitch, please.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.331
Well, well, well.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.367
Look who decided to
swing by Helsinki.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.768
Prodigal son.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.536
Favorite ex-wife.

21:43.570 --> 21:46.773
Come on in. Thank you.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.908
Watch your step.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.943
Watch your step, now.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.814
(laughing) No party, huh?

21:54.847 --> 21:56.683
No.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.851
I mean, where are you
hiding the barely-legals?

21:58.885 --> 22:01.388
Mitch, please.
(laughing): It's okay.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.423
He gets his grudge-holding
from his mother.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.958
Yeah, you remember her.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.396
Max used to refer to her as...
"water under the bridge."

22:09.429 --> 22:10.797
(Allison clears throat)

22:10.830 --> 22:13.099
Your mother left me.

22:13.132 --> 22:16.436
Yeah, well, you were banging
her best friend, so... I was

22:16.469 --> 22:17.937
vigorous in those days.
ALLISON: Oh.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.973
Robust. Let's not dignify
your behavior, Max.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.477
I've been, uh,
following your exploits.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.513
It's a damn shame
that cure didn't work.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.448
What are you doing in
Europe anyway, Max?

22:28.481 --> 22:31.751
Ah... Aside from hiding out in
Helsinki with... let me guess...

22:31.784 --> 22:34.454
A fast boat and a clear
shot to one of those islands

22:34.487 --> 22:35.931
for when the animals
actually take over.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.500
No, I just happened to have
been in the neighborhood

22:37.524 --> 22:39.492
when everything went south.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.462
Looking for, what, a Cyclops?

22:42.495 --> 22:43.896
Don't be ridiculous.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.498
The Arre River
monster, actually.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.066
It's a fascinating creature.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.668
It's like a giant moray eel.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.538
(laughs quietly) MITCH:
That actually makes sense.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.005
You in search of a
mythical creature

22:53.039 --> 22:54.741
that resembles an
enormous penis.

22:54.774 --> 22:55.851
(Allison clears
throat, Max laughs)

22:55.875 --> 22:57.410
Ali? Mm.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.611
You care for a drink?

22:58.645 --> 23:01.548
I have a beautiful bottle of
Tignanello with your name on it.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.516
Actually, Max,
this isn't a social call.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.084
The world is falling apart.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.553
I need you to stop by the plane.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.654
Our plane?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.155
My plane... Max.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.524
My plane.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.927
So let me see if I
understand this correctly.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.429
The woman

23:16.463 --> 23:19.466
who left me and the
son who hates me

23:19.499 --> 23:22.034
have someone gotten
themselves into

23:22.068 --> 23:26.172
such a pickle that
they actually need me.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.744
(whickering)

23:31.778 --> 23:33.546
(engine revving)

23:33.580 --> 23:35.548
(whinnying)

23:35.582 --> 23:37.917
(engine revving,
indistinct shouting)

23:37.950 --> 23:40.119
(engine revving)

23:40.152 --> 23:41.854
(loud whinnying)

23:41.888 --> 23:43.590
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

23:43.623 --> 23:45.458
(distant shouting)

23:45.492 --> 23:47.093
Come on, keep running.
Go. Down the hill!

23:48.561 --> 23:49.962
(loud whinnying)

23:49.996 --> 23:52.532
(engine revving)

23:59.972 --> 24:01.541
(loud, overlapping chatter)

24:01.574 --> 24:03.743
Everyone inside!

24:03.776 --> 24:05.812
Quickly now! MAN: Incoming!

24:05.845 --> 24:07.547
Run through the gate!

24:07.580 --> 24:09.148
(groaning)

24:09.181 --> 24:12.852
(engine revving)

24:12.885 --> 24:14.554
(whinnying)

24:14.587 --> 24:16.489
(engine revving)

24:16.523 --> 24:19.592
Come on, come on, come on.
Go quickly, quickly, quickly.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.827
Keep moving.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.194
Clear the gate.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.798
There's one more coming.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.535
(pop, whoosh)

24:31.103 --> 24:32.605
(engine revving)

24:32.639 --> 24:34.541
(whinnying)

24:34.574 --> 24:36.075
(tires squeak)

24:38.711 --> 24:39.879
(engine revving)

24:39.912 --> 24:41.147
(whinnying)

24:41.180 --> 24:42.749
(tires squealing)

24:49.656 --> 24:51.991
(tires squealing)

24:52.024 --> 24:53.660
Come on!

24:53.693 --> 24:54.927
(engine revving) Come on!

24:54.961 --> 24:56.629
MAN: We gotta close the gate.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.097
Don't you touch that gate!

24:58.130 --> 24:59.599
(engine revving)

24:59.632 --> 25:01.267
Close it now! Please!

25:01.300 --> 25:03.703
(loud whinnying)

25:03.736 --> 25:05.004
(mechanical clang, hissing)

25:05.838 --> 25:08.007
You got to be kidding me.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.275
Come on! Close the gate!

25:09.308 --> 25:11.243
Right now! Come on!

25:12.645 --> 25:15.281
(loud whinnying)

25:15.314 --> 25:18.084
(thumping against gate)

25:18.117 --> 25:19.986
(groans)

25:20.019 --> 25:22.655
(thumping, whinnying continue)

25:22.689 --> 25:23.990
Oh.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.658
(panting)

25:27.026 --> 25:32.031
REPORTER: I can report at this
time that we have confirmation

25:32.064 --> 25:35.067
the Noah Objective will
launch in four days.

25:35.101 --> 25:38.037
That statement was
issued only moments ago

25:38.070 --> 25:40.607
by the United Nations
in cooperation

25:40.640 --> 25:42.350
with the International
Animal Defense Group.

25:42.374 --> 25:47.680
Again, the Noah Objective
will launch in four days.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.216
This countdown
clock will continue

25:50.249 --> 25:53.052
until the day the
gas is released.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.824
The end for the animals...

25:57.857 --> 26:00.760
and with it, hopefully,

26:00.793 --> 26:02.762
a new beginning for us all.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.005
(sighs)

26:13.039 --> 26:16.142
Oh. Are we redecorating
or embracing sloth?

26:17.043 --> 26:20.847
Ah. You saved my stash
in case I came back.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.016
No, Max. I saved your stash
because I forgot it was there.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.885
(clears throat) Peace offering?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.386
I get to keep the fish.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.255
(Allison clears
throat) Suit yourself.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.124
Oh.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.895
Oh. Still good. Hell of a candy.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.966
So... where are these bones
you want me to look at? Well...

26:39.999 --> 26:42.034
JAMIE: You guys
need to see this.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.135
Oh. Hello.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.136
Hi.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.104
Jamie Campbell.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.006
Max Morgan. Your father?

26:47.039 --> 26:48.040
In name only.

26:48.074 --> 26:48.975
Pleasure to meet you, Jamie.

26:49.008 --> 26:52.044
Please don't kiss her hand.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.048
Earlier today,
a statement was released

26:56.082 --> 26:59.051
by General Andrew
Davies of the IADG.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.653
Davies has confirmed

27:00.687 --> 27:03.155
that with the approval
process all but complete,

27:03.189 --> 27:05.792
the Noah Objective will launch

27:05.825 --> 27:08.360
in what is now three
days and 22 hours.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.096
Son of a bitch.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.033
Well, we've got a world to save,

27:14.066 --> 27:16.769
and in some great cosmic irony,
I actually need your help,

27:16.803 --> 27:18.337
so let's get this over with.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.872
Can Jamie come, too?

27:19.906 --> 27:21.908
Yes, Max, Jamie can come, too.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.948
So we've got less than
four days to find an animal

27:28.981 --> 27:32.251
that we all know has been extinct
for, oh, 14,000 years.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.758
This is remarkable. Truly.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.159
Our information suggests

27:40.192 --> 27:43.129
it may have been alive as
recently as 100 years ago.

27:43.162 --> 27:46.933
And if it was, maybe there's
hope we can still find one.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.068
A saber-toothed cat?

27:49.101 --> 27:51.303
Yeah. A saber-toothed cat.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.907
We need to find out how
old these bones are,

27:54.941 --> 27:55.908
but there's soil contamination,

27:55.942 --> 27:58.310
so carbon dating's not
gonna get us close enough.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.113
Well, there are ways.

28:01.147 --> 28:04.083
But they'll confirm exactly
what I'm telling you.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.318
This cat's been dead
for thousands of years.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.454
We need to know for sure.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.123
You know, a few years ago,

28:11.157 --> 28:14.326
I came across what I thought
were Loch Ness monster remains.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.995
I dated the bones,

28:16.028 --> 28:18.064
measuring the aspartic acid.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.999
So can we do this?

28:20.032 --> 28:22.268
Alas, once again,
it wasn't Nessy.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.805
And, uh...
I-I do believe that it was

28:25.838 --> 28:27.439
my last shot at her. The, uh,

28:27.473 --> 28:28.975
pursuit of the unattainable.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.142
Can motivate a life.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.243
(laughs)

28:31.277 --> 28:32.478
Max? Yeah.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.046
Can you date these bones or not?

28:34.080 --> 28:35.147
Yes and no.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.949
Bones have to be
completely clean.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.526
Otherwise, the desiccated
soft tissue will just...

28:38.550 --> 28:40.186
throw off the results.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.396
Okay, so, let's clean 'em.
What's the problem?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.956
'Cause in order for the bones
to be completely cleaned,

28:43.990 --> 28:46.025
they need to be
boiled for 72 hours,

28:46.058 --> 28:47.960
which is more time than
it sounds like you have.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.161
Or we could just do this.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.263
Mitch! Yeah.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.032
See, jellyfish are carnivorous.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.801
I'm sure Moe here
would be delighted

28:54.834 --> 28:56.135
to chew off any dry tissue,

28:56.168 --> 28:59.071
seeing as he hasn't
had lunch yet.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.107
That's my boy.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.910
(laughs)

29:09.115 --> 29:11.217
(indistinct crowd chatter)

29:19.291 --> 29:21.360
I need to use the phone.
It's important.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.462
You should relax now.
You're safe.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.397
If we're to believe
what they're telling us,

29:25.431 --> 29:28.134
in another four days,
the whole world will be safe.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.312
Thanks for patching me up,
but if I don't get to a phone,

29:30.336 --> 29:32.771
you're not gonna like what
happens in another four days.

29:36.976 --> 29:40.947
(sighs) My mother didn't have a
scar when we moved to Africa, Abe.

29:40.980 --> 29:44.984
I just looked at
this old picture.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.453
No. My father...

29:47.486 --> 29:50.422
He-he gave me the injection
before we left Boston, but...

29:50.456 --> 29:52.825
but he obviously...
he didn't give it to my mother.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.127
And you're wondering
how it happened.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.329
Did my father visit Africa, Abe,

29:57.363 --> 30:00.299
while I was out on safari,
or when I was at school?

30:01.133 --> 30:03.169
N-No, I don't think so.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.237
Well, then, here's the problem.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.239
Either my father gave
her this injection,

30:07.273 --> 30:08.841
or somebody else did.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.376
(P.A. beeps)

30:10.409 --> 30:12.344
TROTTER: Abe,
urgent call for you.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.915
(Abraham sighs)

30:17.416 --> 30:18.550
(beeping)

30:18.584 --> 30:20.052
Abraham Kenyatta here.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.121
DARIELA: God,
it's good to hear your voice.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.123
Dariela. Where are you?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.859
We made it to the safe zone,
but something happened.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.127
What is it?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.862
I was attacked by horses.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.297
They came after me, Abe.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.065
But you are okay?

30:33.099 --> 30:35.434
Yes, but...
I was traveling with all those people

30:35.467 --> 30:37.303
from Holbeach...
and the horses...

30:37.336 --> 30:37.937
They singled me out.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.940
What? I don't understand.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.208
There's something about me.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.485
Or there's something about them.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.144
The people that she's with.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.447
Dariela, did the horses target

30:48.480 --> 30:50.082
any of the others at all?

30:50.116 --> 30:52.384
No. It's like they didn't
even see them, like

30:52.418 --> 30:53.619
the animals are with Jackson.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.287
No, they'd all have
to have the gene.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.990
Or the mutation is changing.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.960
(water gurgling)

31:00.993 --> 31:02.962
Amazing thing about jellyfish is

31:02.995 --> 31:06.332
they eat, poop and procreate
all from the same orifice.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.935
Kind of like you, Max.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.904
(laughs) If I could do that,
I'd never leave the house.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.275
(laughing)

31:16.308 --> 31:18.310
This is nice, Mitchell, no?

31:20.012 --> 31:22.248
Us working side by side
after all these years?

31:22.281 --> 31:24.216
Not really, no.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.385
We could turn over a new leaf.

31:26.418 --> 31:29.355
Trust me,
there will be no leaf-turning.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.358
(chuckles)

31:35.294 --> 31:37.329
Oh, yeah.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.300
Lovely.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.373
(hissing)

31:47.406 --> 31:48.407
ABRAHAM: Hey, guys?

31:48.440 --> 31:49.641
We just spoke to Dariela.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.010
ALLISON: Yes? And?

31:51.043 --> 31:52.344
MAX: Give that ten minutes.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.579
We should get some answers.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.580
In the meantime,

31:54.613 --> 31:57.183
I'm going to reacquaint
myself with my Scotch.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.087
JACKSON: You know how

32:01.120 --> 32:03.265
we thought that the ghost gene
infected 2.2 million people?

32:03.289 --> 32:05.257
ALLISON: That was Davies'

32:05.291 --> 32:07.235
projection...
they're all gonna be collateral damage

32:07.259 --> 32:10.262
if... when the Noah
Objective releases the gas.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.498
Judging by what she
just went through,

32:12.531 --> 32:13.565
our numbers were wrong.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.833
How wrong? Based on what

32:14.866 --> 32:18.104
she saw, there may be billions
of people with the ghost gene.

32:22.008 --> 32:24.410
Just in.
We have confirmed reports

32:24.443 --> 32:28.180
of animal attacks in Tel
Aviv, Sydney and Ottawa.

32:28.214 --> 32:31.450
Casualties in Sydney appear
to be in the thousands

32:31.483 --> 32:33.285
in what looks to be another

32:33.319 --> 32:35.687
coordinated,
multi-species attack.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.499
That attack was said to be...
Lieutenant Marzan?

32:37.523 --> 32:39.367
In the area surrounding
the iconic opera house

32:39.391 --> 32:41.760
and the financial district downtown.
Hey, Doc.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.138
I found something
rather unexpected

32:43.162 --> 32:44.196
in your blood results.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.197
I thought you should know.

32:45.231 --> 32:48.100
Martial law while the
Israeli Defense Board

32:48.134 --> 32:50.436
has begun evacuating
much of Tel Aviv...

32:50.469 --> 32:54.140
Authorities declined
to speculate on how...

32:54.173 --> 32:55.774
No.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.143
Is this for real?

33:00.412 --> 33:02.448
Oh, my God.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.151
Maybe I was right.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.053
About what?

33:07.086 --> 33:08.620
Maybe they were targeting me.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.322
Who?

33:10.356 --> 33:12.391
I have to get back.

33:12.424 --> 33:13.559
I have to get to Finland.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.103
Does somebody have a
chopper around here?

33:15.127 --> 33:17.329
Because I need it now.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.664
We got it.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.466
All right.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.301
Based on the
aspartic acid levels,

33:22.334 --> 33:24.736
this saber-toothed cat was...

33:24.770 --> 33:26.038
alive a hundred years ago.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.475
MITCH: What is that?

33:29.508 --> 33:32.311
That means that
bones showed traces

33:32.344 --> 33:34.746
of a synthetic
bio-active compound.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.615
So...

33:36.648 --> 33:40.086
we weren't just wrong
about the extinction date.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.622
This animal was...

33:43.655 --> 33:45.357
Somebody made him.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.425
Made him?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.759
MITCH: A hundred years ago.

33:47.793 --> 33:48.827
ABRAHAM: How is that

33:48.860 --> 33:50.462
even possible?

33:50.496 --> 33:52.531
What aren't you telling us, Max?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.436
You're sure these were
never tampered with?

33:57.469 --> 33:58.637
Beyond a shadow,

33:58.670 --> 34:00.406
sure? Hundred percent.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.773
Wait, what does this mean?

34:01.807 --> 34:04.143
Three years ago,

34:04.176 --> 34:06.312
I was in Chile,
searching for what

34:06.345 --> 34:08.514
the locals called a sea monster.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.049
I figured what they'd seen
was a giant squid, but...

34:11.882 --> 34:13.284
Their descriptions were oddly

34:13.319 --> 34:15.821
consistent with Pelycosauria.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.827
Um, that's... aquatic dinosaurs.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.530
Besides the fact that
pelycosaurs have been extinct

34:24.563 --> 34:27.399
for 66 million years,
it seemed very unlikely

34:27.433 --> 34:29.411
that the Chilean locals
would have ever heard of him,

34:29.435 --> 34:30.469
let alone been able

34:30.502 --> 34:31.545
to so accurately describe them.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.440
What does this have to
do with the saber-tooth?

34:34.473 --> 34:38.110
They talked about a secret
research facility located

34:38.143 --> 34:40.379
off the coast on one of
the Juan Fernández Islands.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.214
What kind of research facility?

34:42.248 --> 34:45.484
They supposedly had developed
a synthetic bio-active compound

34:45.516 --> 34:49.121
that allowed them to
recreate extinct animals.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.391
I didn't believe it...
until now.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.793
ALLISON: Max.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.395
We need a saber-toothed cat.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.333
Well...

35:01.367 --> 35:03.769
sounds like there's only one
place on Earth you can find it.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.805
And they call it Pangaea.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.746
(creature wails)

35:15.747 --> 35:17.749
(large cat roars)

35:26.258 --> 35:27.025
Looks like a fiber-optic company

35:27.058 --> 35:28.694
laid about $50
million worth of cable

35:28.727 --> 35:30.572
between the mainland and
the Juan Fernández Islands.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.364
ALLISON: And, according

35:32.398 --> 35:33.408
to the Chilean Port Authority,

35:33.432 --> 35:34.876
there's supply ships making
runs every other week.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.368
So, the rumors are true.

35:36.402 --> 35:37.569
The island exists.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.406
The question is, which island?

35:40.439 --> 35:42.208
Well,
we just fly into Concepción,

35:42.241 --> 35:43.175
and start looking. Five people

35:43.209 --> 35:45.344
against the kind of
money and brain power

35:45.377 --> 35:47.279
that would have
to be behind this?

35:47.313 --> 35:49.381
Well, it's not the worst
odds we've ever faced.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.350
Tomorrow I'll check
Jackson's blood.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.385
Make sure he won't
reject the cure.

35:53.419 --> 35:55.187
Last step of the journey, kids.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.625
We need to speak

35:59.658 --> 36:00.859
in private.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.362
Now, rafiki.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.464
Trotter,
can you please file a flight plan

36:05.497 --> 36:07.299
to Concepción, Chile?
TROTTER: Yes, ma'am.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.903
So... this is good-bye?

36:11.937 --> 36:14.206
Yes. Yes, Max, this is good-bye.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.275
You know, it doesn't have to be.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.209
ALLISON: Really? MAX: Really.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.944
Just let your team do
the dragon chasing.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.282
MAX: Ali.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.983
Stay in Helsinki with me.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.419
You are... unbelievable.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.588
She's a grown woman, sport.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.323
I'm starting to have
a little déjà vu here.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.391
Oh... Mitch.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.459
MAX: Here we go.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.427
12 years ago, the...

36:35.461 --> 36:37.963
Pierre Hotel,
I think it was, right?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.631
You were being
honored for something.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.600
For contributions
I made to the zoo.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.236
Yeah, I funded a very
elegant rhino enclosure.

36:44.270 --> 36:47.773
And you delivered a
pretty great speech.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.708
Yeah, not the one
you gave for dinner,

36:49.741 --> 36:52.478
the one you gave at dessert...
to my girlfriend.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.346
Can we please not
do this right now?

36:54.380 --> 36:56.391
You should have said something
if it bothered you. Yeah?

36:56.415 --> 36:57.983
Like what?

36:58.016 --> 37:00.319
Hey, Dad, really appreciate
it if you didn't try

37:00.352 --> 37:01.320
to skeez her out from under me.

37:01.353 --> 37:04.256
Well, in-in hindsight,
it was rather poor form.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.324
Yeah, you think? Hey.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.892
I married her. You weren't even

37:06.925 --> 37:08.670
ready to give her a damn
friendship bracelet.

37:08.694 --> 37:09.728
Oh, my God.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.029
I was young and stupid.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.265
You feel better now that
you got that off your chest?

37:13.299 --> 37:13.999
Hey, Max.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.967
Get the hell off our plane.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.273
We can do this, Abe, okay?

37:21.307 --> 37:22.774
We fly into Concepción.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.042
We choose an island.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.411
We start there.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.778
Process of elimination,
we just...

37:26.812 --> 37:28.414
It was me. Go through...

37:28.447 --> 37:30.882
What was you?

37:30.916 --> 37:33.319
Elizabeth, it...

37:33.352 --> 37:34.486
it... I did it.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.422
Did what?

37:37.456 --> 37:38.890
I injected her.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.794
What are you talking about?

37:44.630 --> 37:48.300
I'm trying to tell you...

37:48.334 --> 37:50.436
that it was me.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.274
I injected your mother.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.379
(laughing): What?

38:09.688 --> 38:11.723
How would you do that, Abe?

38:11.757 --> 38:13.792
Where would you
have even gotten it?

38:14.826 --> 38:16.795
Your father came to me.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.371
Mitch, I'm...

38:25.404 --> 38:27.539
I'm sorry.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.007
Don't apologize for him.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.041
I'm not.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.043
I'm apologizing for me.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.545
I was young.

38:33.579 --> 38:37.783
I-I didn't know what it meant.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.422
Well, it messed me up.

38:43.455 --> 38:46.425
Yeah, well,
you didn't act like it.

38:46.458 --> 38:50.061
Well... that's what I do.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.097
Yeah.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.332
Still...

38:56.435 --> 38:57.936
Here we are.

39:02.508 --> 39:03.509
JAMIE: Hey, Max.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.511
Oh.

39:05.544 --> 39:06.645
You forgot your fish.

39:07.679 --> 39:10.148
Thank you.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.050
You know, I'm glad I met you.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.084
You are?

39:13.118 --> 39:14.986
Why's that?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.623
I don't know,
I guess for the first time I feel like

39:17.656 --> 39:20.626
I understand why Mitch is so...
irritating.

39:20.659 --> 39:21.627
Because I...

39:21.660 --> 39:23.995
married his girlfriend?

39:24.029 --> 39:26.465
And just having you as a father.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.899
I'm not that bad.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.035
No? No, no.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.538
My life's work has been the
endless search for the mythical,

39:32.571 --> 39:34.473
and really,
what's more mythical,

39:34.506 --> 39:35.641
more out of reach than

39:35.674 --> 39:36.675
love?

39:38.544 --> 39:39.945
I think you love my son.

39:39.978 --> 39:40.946
Ha, I think you're crazy.

39:40.979 --> 39:41.947
(laughing): Okay.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.449
Fine.

39:43.482 --> 39:46.552
Another thing I got wrong today.

39:47.553 --> 39:48.987
But I love my son.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.089
So, would you do me a favor

39:51.122 --> 39:52.190
and tell him that for me?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.759
Yeah, I will.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.093
Thank you.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.529
You're welcome.

39:58.564 --> 39:59.665
Bye, Max.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.767
You're not so bad.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.535
(whispering): My father...

40:03.569 --> 40:04.569
my father.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.473
What? Why would...

40:07.506 --> 40:09.475
Why-why-why would you do that?

40:10.809 --> 40:13.579
He gave me $200.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.193
She was the only family I had
left, Abe.

40:28.226 --> 40:31.530
No, no,
that's not entirely true.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.600
If you are referring to
yourself, how dare you.

40:34.633 --> 40:35.601
No, no.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.202
I'm talking about your father.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.470
My father...

40:38.504 --> 40:39.237
is dead.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.639
Your father

40:40.672 --> 40:42.007
is still alive,

40:42.040 --> 40:44.442
and he's working
with General Davies.

40:47.779 --> 40:48.880
Jackson!

40:51.517 --> 40:53.652
(whispering): This is insane.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.873
Mitch.

41:16.675 --> 41:19.545
Mitch, it's me.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.930
(grunting)

41:38.964 --> 41:40.231
Jackson!

41:46.572 --> 41:48.239
(Jackson grunts)

41:48.273 --> 41:49.207
Jackson!

41:49.240 --> 41:50.876
(gunshot)

41:53.779 --> 41:54.946
(glass shatters)

42:00.351 --> 42:01.953
DANIELA: The vehicle bay.

42:01.987 --> 42:03.555
He ran to the vehicle bay.

42:03.589 --> 42:04.856
I'm sorry.

42:04.890 --> 42:05.957
I'm so sorry.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.735
He's gone.
