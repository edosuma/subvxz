07:11.431 --> 07:15.018
from my record!

07:15.060 --> 07:19.314
Sorry, Steph. But you happen

07:15.060 --> 07:19.314
to be hooping in my laboratory.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.524
Hey, what can we use

07:19.356 --> 07:21.524
to build this thing?

07:21.566 --> 07:23.110
Ah, anything around the house.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.280
How about a suitcase

07:23.151 --> 07:26.280
full of cotton?

07:26.321 --> 07:30.617
Rule number 26.

07:26.321 --> 07:30.617
"No suitcases full of cotton."

07:30.658 --> 07:34.621
Hey, no fair. You said you

07:30.658 --> 07:34.621
were too busy to play with me.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.415
How come you are

07:34.662 --> 07:36.415
playing with D.J.?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.709
Stephanie , we are not playing.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.709
This is for D.J.'s school.

Yeah, this happens to be

a sixth grade science project.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.425
Well, pin a rose on your nose.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.140
You're just too young

07:50.429 --> 07:53.140
to understand.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.351
I got it. I got a great idea.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.355
We put the egg inside nature's

07:56.393 --> 08:00.355
perfect shock absorber..

08:00.397 --> 08:01.731
...a Twinkie.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.611
Good thinking, Ding Dong.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.928
Jess, I think we got it.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.430
Hanky parachute,

18:14.969 --> 18:17.430
double Twinkie landing craft..

18:17.471 --> 18:20.182
Now, Mr. Wizard,

18:17.471 --> 18:20.182
we do have the technology.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.768
Deej, let her rip.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.519
Eggs Away take 2!

18:25.855 --> 18:29.025
Yeah, alright!

18:29.067 --> 18:30.401
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.861
Alright, you're welcome.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.195
Now, Joseph and I

18:31.903 --> 18:33.195
have to get back

18:33.237 --> 18:34.572
to our jingle for Sweat world.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.156
Thank you, D.J.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.826
You guys are geniuses.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.453
Well, you know what Edison said

18:40.494 --> 18:44.999
"Genius is 1% inspiration

18:40.494 --> 18:44.999
and 99% perspiration."

18:46.709 --> 18:48.419
What's that supposed to mean?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.630
Means if you don't sweat it

18:48.461 --> 18:50.630
you don't get it.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.469
(both)

18:53.257 --> 18:56.469
If you don't sweat it,

18:53.257 --> 18:56.469
you don't get it.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.680
That's it, Joseph. Alright, ah,

18:56.510 --> 18:59.680
ah, lets put it with the music.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.951
Go around, go around.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.167
Come here, you cutie.

19:28.208 --> 19:32.588
People, I would like to make

19:28.208 --> 19:32.588
a very important announcement.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.799
I was married this afternoon.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.468
Pardon me?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.886
Hi, dad.

19:40.471 --> 19:43.516
Well, don't you two make

19:40.471 --> 19:43.516
a cute little bride and groom.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.935
You could stand on top

19:43.557 --> 19:45.935
of your own wedding cake.

19:47.394 --> 19:51.315
Well, good bye, everyone.

19:47.394 --> 19:51.315
It's been a great six years.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.484
Harry, let's go house-hunting.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.112
No, I have to go home.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.112
Bye, Steph.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.489
Bye, Pop.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.617
Wait, wait.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.617
You can't walk out on me.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.244
Yes, I can.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.244
Tonight's meatloaf night.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.086
Great. Nobody wants me.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.132
Steph? What do you mean

20:13.379 --> 20:16.132
"Nobody wants you?"

20:16.174 --> 20:17.925
Your family wants you.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.677
Some family.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.180
You didn't even care that

20:19.719 --> 20:22.180
I broke the hula-hoop record

20:22.221 --> 20:24.682
or went to Mars.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.225
You went to Mars?

20:27.768 --> 20:30.146
Maybe, we have been

20:27.768 --> 20:30.146
a tad preoccupied.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.275
Kiddo, we're, uh, we're sorry

20:32.732 --> 20:35.275
if we ignored you.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.111
We didn't mean to.

20:37.153 --> 20:40.280
I think we were just little

20:37.153 --> 20:40.280
caught up in what we were doing.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.659
Well, now my science project's

20:40.322 --> 20:43.659
done I can watch you hula hoop.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.995
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.454
You're always gonna

20:46.037 --> 20:47.454
be the oldest

20:47.496 --> 20:49.165
and Michelle's always

20:47.496 --> 20:49.165
gonna be the baby

20:49.207 --> 20:52.459
and I'm always gonna be stuck

20:49.207 --> 20:52.459
in the middle.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.754
Hold it, Goldilocks.

20:54.795 --> 20:58.298
See what I mean. I'm stuck

20:54.795 --> 20:58.298
in the middle again!

20:59.633 --> 21:01.427
- Stephanie.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.427
- Sit down.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.097
I understand

21:01.468 --> 21:04.097
how you're feeling.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.182
But there's another way

21:04.138 --> 21:06.182
to look at this.

21:06.224 --> 21:09.060
There's a lot of special things

21:06.224 --> 21:09.060
about being in the middle.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.937
Yeah, your pop's right.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.272
Uh, take a bologna sandwich

21:10.978 --> 21:13.272
for instance.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.775
What's the best part

21:13.313 --> 21:15.775
of a bologna sandwich?

21:15.816 --> 21:17.151
The bologna.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.946
- And where is the bologna?

21:17.193 --> 21:19.946
- In the middle.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.447
Bingo. Alright.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.865
And, uh, Oreo cookie.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.658
What's the best part

21:22.907 --> 21:24.658
of an Oreo cookie?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.827
Chocolate milk you dunk it in.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.747
Come on, Steph. You know where

21:26.869 --> 21:29.747
I'm going with this.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.666
I know.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.666
The cream is the best part.

21:36.212 --> 21:40.466
Yes, Joseph. The cream.

21:36.212 --> 21:40.466
And where is the cream?

21:40.507 --> 21:42.509
In the middle.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.098
Don't help.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.098
It's in the..

21:47.140 --> 21:49.516
- Middle.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.516
- Right.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.853
Steph, what all this bologna

21:49.558 --> 21:52.853
and cookie talk is getting to is

21:52.895 --> 21:56.565
every position in a family

21:52.895 --> 21:56.565
is special in its own way.

21:56.607 --> 21:59.277
Yeah, you're the only one in

21:56.607 --> 21:59.277
the family who has a big sister

21:59.318 --> 22:00.319
and a little sister.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.405
That's true. What else you got?

22:03.447 --> 22:06.826
Well, another good thing about

22:03.447 --> 22:06.826
the being middle child is

22:06.867 --> 22:09.369
a lot of the mistakes

22:06.867 --> 22:09.369
we made raising D.J.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.871
we won't have to make on you.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.040
I'm getting depressed.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.959
So far, I'm the soggy part

22:13.082 --> 22:14.959
of the sandwich

22:15.001 --> 22:17.586
and the throwaway part

22:15.001 --> 22:17.586
of the cookie.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.713
I like that.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.926
Stephanie, come here.

22:23.968 --> 22:28.472
You have to realize

22:23.968 --> 22:28.472
that sometimes your sisters

22:28.514 --> 22:30.432
are gonna need our attention.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.186
But if you ever feel that you're

22:30.474 --> 22:33.186
not getting your fair share

22:33.227 --> 22:35.938
I want you to come

22:33.227 --> 22:35.938
and tell us about it.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.065
Really? I can do that?

22:38.107 --> 22:39.608
You better.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.401
Every time I get

22:39.650 --> 22:41.401
a little busy with something

22:41.443 --> 22:43.696
I don't want you to run off

22:41.443 --> 22:43.696
and get married.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.364
Me neither.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.617
I don't know about

22:46.406 --> 22:48.617
this husband thing.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.578
One whiff of their mom's

22:48.659 --> 22:51.578
meatloaf and they are gone.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.916
Come here, you beautiful bride.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.211
Me next.

23:01.005 --> 23:04.258
Okay, Lay one on your Uncle J,

23:01.005 --> 23:04.258
you know how it's done.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.844
Alright.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.264
Oh, well, come on.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.475
Hug.

23:17.271 --> 23:21.817
You know, I think this home

23:17.271 --> 23:21.817
video would be so much better

23:21.859 --> 23:23.903
if it had all three of my girls.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.031
Let me see, you want to sing

23:23.944 --> 23:27.031
"I write the songs"

23:27.073 --> 23:29.407
or go for the hula-hoop record?

23:29.449 --> 23:31.702
Daddy, I can do both.
