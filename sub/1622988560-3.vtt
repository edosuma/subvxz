It's all one case, right?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.482
It is, but more victims
means more charges,

10:48.523 --> 10:50.609
and they can arrest you again.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.278
And the prosecutor will say
to the judge, "Your Honor,

the more charges, the more
likely the defendant will flee.

they have to find you first.

Yes. Standing on my head.

- What happened?

12:16.027 --> 12:17.863
We were just getting started.
Her lawyer showed.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.824
You can't put that on me.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.951
So how do you think her lawyer
knew where to find her?

12:22.993 --> 12:24.744
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.246
She would've lawyered up
sooner or later.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.790

over for dinner tonight,
um, but if it isn't...

12:59.279 --> 13:00.739

13:43.865 --> 13:47.494
Mother of God.
A warning from who?

13:47.536 --> 13:50.705
According to one of
the firebombers, La Mayorista.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.376
The drug dealer.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.628
Detectives are
questioning her now.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.714
You understand how much
the community wants closure.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.469
Sooner rather than later.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.138
It takes what it takes.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.688
You have my full support.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.148
I appreciate that.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.364
You had lunch with
Francis Alexander the other day.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.199
He's an old friend.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.410
I understand he's stepping down.

14:30.704 --> 14:34.416
Really? He didn't
mention that to me.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.419
Madam Mayor.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.878
Chief.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.048
[door opens]

14:42.090 --> 14:43.425
[knocking on door]

14:43.466 --> 14:46.678
- [Chandler] It's open.
- You wanted to see me?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.930
Yeah, since Miller's out today,
please confirm my meeting

14:48.972 --> 14:51.016
with Burton DeVore
at the SEC this afternoon.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.518
- The Franzen case?
- Oh, a-and call Miller

14:53.560 --> 14:55.145
and ask him
where we are on Brandschaft.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.396
He finished the motion.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.064
Um, I checked the citations
this morning,

14:58.106 --> 14:59.649
I filed it on my way in.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.484
Now you're just showing off.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.361
[chuckles] Go on, scat.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.573
[door closes]

15:09.284 --> 15:11.286
You tell me.

15:13.330 --> 15:16.625
Well, the lettering,

15:16.666 --> 15:19.210
the shoe polish,
the elegant vocabulary...

15:19.252 --> 15:21.212
- Mm.
- [exhales]

15:21.254 --> 15:23.590
Smells like a copper to me.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.052
I'll keep my ears open.
I'll ask around.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.303
All right, thanks.
Appreciate it.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.847
No names.
Keep it on the down-low.

15:30.889 --> 15:34.142
I filed a vandalism report
with West Bureau

15:34.184 --> 15:37.479
- and a 128 with I.A.
- Oh, boy. [chuckles]

15:37.520 --> 15:39.856
Fasten your seat belts.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.942
- Mistake?
- Well, it does launch

15:42.984 --> 15:45.820
the proverbial merde into
the perpetually spinning blades

15:45.862 --> 15:47.447
of the mythic fan.

15:47.489 --> 15:50.450
- I had no choice.
- What's done is done.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.577
It's just... [sighs]

15:52.619 --> 15:54.287
L.T., filing a formal complaint?

15:54.329 --> 15:56.790
Boy, that is a fucking
pillowcase full of snakes,

15:56.831 --> 15:58.041
in my opinion.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.503
I...

16:01.544 --> 16:03.004
I could be wrong.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.468
Your client is being prosecuted
under a fraud statute

16:08.510 --> 16:12.055
by the U.S Attorney for the
Central District of California.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.516
Shouldn't you be talking
to that office?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.726
I have a proposition.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.853
If you're asking me to intercede
with the U.S. attorney's office

16:18.895 --> 16:21.481
- on your behalf...
- No, no. Not at all.

16:21.523 --> 16:25.735
I'm not here to deny or defend
or minimize in any way

16:25.777 --> 16:26.945
my client's malfeasance.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.072
Don't see how you could.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.699
A pyramid of phony gold bullion

16:30.740 --> 16:33.159
made out of balsa wood
and spray paint?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.663
Well, you have to admire
his chutzpah.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.791
Off the record? Yeah.
[laughs softly]

16:42.168 --> 16:43.878
So, Nu?

16:45.088 --> 16:48.383
If my client
could hand you, the SEC,

16:48.425 --> 16:52.595
an insider trading scheme worth,
say, $2 billion...

16:52.637 --> 16:55.181
- Is this your client's scheme?
- Not involved.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.810
Much bigger fish.
But he has firsthand knowledge.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.562
Names and numbers?

17:00.603 --> 17:02.605
Voluminous documentation.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.733
Would that pique your interest?

17:06.735 --> 17:08.153
Consider it piqued.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.947
And in return?

17:10.989 --> 17:13.783
You and I work something out
with the U.S. attorney.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.661
So you do want me to intercede.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.079
No jail time.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.497
[scoffs]

17:21.499 --> 17:23.752
Your client's not the only one
with chutzpah.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.463
[clicking mouse]

17:26.504 --> 17:28.506
[phone chimes, buzzes]

17:34.554 --> 17:35.972
[Lopez] [over TV] I'm here today

17:36.014 --> 17:39.184
because the Little Tamale Girl
is my daughter.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.978
She's everyone's daughter.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.607
Sonia Hernandez and her mother
and all of the other victims

17:45.648 --> 17:48.943
and survivors
deserve dignity and respect.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.322
Most of all,
they deserve answers.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.366
And I promise all of the people
of Los Angeles,

17:55.408 --> 17:57.035
you will get answers.

17:59.037 --> 18:03.625
Chief Irving,
we can, we must do better.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.127
It's no longer
business as usual.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.129
It's time for a change.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.173
[reporters clamoring]

18:18.181 --> 18:19.390
[scoffs]

18:27.023 --> 18:29.818
- [Pierce] Lieutenant.
- Yes.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.986
[whispers] Hey. Uh...

18:32.028 --> 18:33.655
Spit it out, Rondell.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.741
With the end of Hollywood
Homicide on the horizon,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.785
how many detectives
from our unit

18:38.827 --> 18:40.912
will be transferred
to West Bureau Homicide?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.915
- Realistically.
- Uh, two for sure, maybe three.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.376
- So one, maybe.
- How do you figure?

18:46.417 --> 18:49.921
Come on, L.T.
Bosch and J. Edgar are a lock.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.215
Uh, that leaves one, maybe.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.551
Well, not necessarily.
Hey, Juan.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.386
[Pierce] Bosch
is a living legend.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.096
He may want to go to RHD.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.975
- And J. Edgar?
- Right now nobody is a lock.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.810
Will you recommend me?

19:03.852 --> 19:06.563
I will give Captain O'Brian
at West Bureau

19:06.604 --> 19:08.648
my honest appraisal.
It's his call.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.943
But yes, you are
a viable candidate.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.279
- You and Vega both.
- Vega.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.905
[Billets] Yeah. Hey, pro tip?

19:15.947 --> 19:18.616
Start studying now.
The orals are a bitch.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.374
Jesus, Grace, a 128?

19:31.421 --> 19:35.341
If you think it's my guys,
why didn't you just come to me?

19:35.383 --> 19:38.595
Why file a fucking incident
report with I.A.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.889
and start
an internal investigation?

19:40.930 --> 19:43.057
I never said
it was one of yours.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.102
Well, that's the grapevine.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.480
It's absolutely not true, Don.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.774
Besides, it's not
our problem now.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.985
[laughs] Thanks to you.

19:54.027 --> 19:57.906
Yeah. Let's just let
I.A. do their thing.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.409
Great.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.014
[line ringing]

20:23.056 --> 20:24.682
[clears throat]

20:26.017 --> 20:27.852
Mr. Browne.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.771
[Browne] Uh-oh.
I know that voice.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.148
Nothing but trouble.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.150
Just a call to see if
you might be interested

20:34.192 --> 20:36.694
in a special assignment.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.322
[Browne] You know I'm not
the spry young buck I was

20:39.364 --> 20:41.866
back in the day.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.994
Then this is just the right gig
for your demographic.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.121
Help you catch up on your rest.

20:47.163 --> 20:50.625
[Browne] This is
highly suspicious.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.002
I'd consider it
a personal favor.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.546
[Browne] Extremely suspicious.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.757
Are you interested?

20:57.799 --> 21:00.218
Maddie. Since Miller's
down for the count,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.095
can you run the video camera?

21:02.136 --> 21:04.055
Yeah, I'm sure
I can figure it out.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.350
Okay, we're gonna put Franzen
on tape, tell his story.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.061
I'll go over it with him,
shore up the details,

21:10.103 --> 21:13.398
critique his delivery,
get rid of any contradictions.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.108
Accentuate the positive.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.402
Eliminate the negative.
You up for it?

21:17.443 --> 21:18.486
Sure.

21:18.528 --> 21:19.779
Good.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.043
[sighs]

21:36.713 --> 21:38.339
[Edgar grunts]

21:40.133 --> 21:42.969
Oh, ye of little faith.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.430
What's the matter?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.017
- Where are the boys?
- At the movie.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.351
What?

21:50.393 --> 21:51.978
Benny offered to take them,

21:52.020 --> 21:53.980
and I didn't know
if you were gonna show up,

21:54.022 --> 21:56.149
and I didn't want them
to be disappointed again.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.775
- LaTonya.
- What?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.652
What, Jerry?

21:59.694 --> 22:01.779
You got to give me
a chance here.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.072
Why?

22:06.951 --> 22:08.953
Let them know I came by.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.879
[Valens] Tell you
the hardest thing for me--

22:17.920 --> 22:20.631
for everyone--

22:20.673 --> 22:22.925
when we lose a kid.

22:22.967 --> 22:26.095
Not to be glib, but...

22:26.137 --> 22:28.389
comes with the job, doesn't it?

22:28.431 --> 22:30.058
It does.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.477
It's what you signed up for.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.645
Like joining the military.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.688
Or the police.

22:36.731 --> 22:40.068
Ever get any easier?

22:40.109 --> 22:42.236
No, never does.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.863
Gets harder every year.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.448
Yeah.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.366
The Little Tamale Girl.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.787
What do you know about her?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.123
Sonia Hernandez.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.000
Born in Los Angeles.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.544
American citizen.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.422
Only child of
Mexican immigrant parents.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.093
Mother a maid.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.178
Father a day laborer.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.724
He got deported last year.

23:11.766 --> 23:14.435
Lost his green card after a DUI.

23:17.688 --> 23:20.942
Sonia spoke to her father
on the phone once a month.

23:23.277 --> 23:25.279
Once a month.

23:27.448 --> 23:30.326
The night of the fire,
she was...

23:30.368 --> 23:32.328
running errands for her mother.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.081
She got lost in the smoke,

23:35.123 --> 23:37.333
and her mother went to find her.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.921
Did well in school.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.714
Sweet.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.008
Kind.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.927
Bright.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.804
Bright future.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.558
Everybody in the building
loved her.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.646
Just an...

23:58.688 --> 24:01.149
ordinary little
ten-year-old girl.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.696
What more do you need
to know about her?

24:10.575 --> 24:13.411
[woman] [over P.A.] Dr. Stern
to Labor and Delivery.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.289
Dr. Stern to Labor and Delivery.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.969
[raspy breaths]

24:38.853 --> 24:40.855
[insects chirping]

24:42.940 --> 24:44.942
[dog barking in distance]

25:12.803 --> 25:15.139
I made a mistake.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.642
But calling me out in front
of the whole fucking squad room?

25:17.683 --> 25:20.061
I'm tired of waiting for you
to get your mojo back, Jerry.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.355
I got to call you out,
I'm gonna call you out.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.941
Well, next time
we take care of it in private.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.609
All right?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.787
[Chandler] Do you swear this
testimony is true and complete,

25:37.828 --> 25:39.372
to the best of your knowledge?

25:39.413 --> 25:41.249
- I do.
- [Chandler] Do you understand

25:41.290 --> 25:42.667
that if anything
you've said proves

25:42.708 --> 25:44.710
to be false in fact or degree,

25:44.752 --> 25:47.213
your agreement will be abrogated
and you will go to jail?

25:47.255 --> 25:48.839
- I understand.
- [Chandler] And you assert

25:48.881 --> 25:50.633
under oath
you have documentation

25:50.675 --> 25:52.885
that supports your contentions
and that you will turn it over

25:52.927 --> 25:56.055
to the appropriate authorities
when the time comes?

25:56.097 --> 25:58.057
Yes, yes. I have the real shit.

25:58.099 --> 26:00.059
- We done?
- Mm, for now.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.478
I'll get you a copy
of this video, with notes.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.439
Maddie, I'm gonna need you
to type this up.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.441
Can you read that?

26:07.483 --> 26:09.110
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.570
You will go over it tonight,

26:11.612 --> 26:13.239
and we will meet in the morning

26:13.281 --> 26:15.700
to discuss
the suggested changes.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.035
Hmm, well, I like how you work.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.289
No matter how hard-ass
the SEC guy is,

26:21.330 --> 26:23.124
he can't touch you.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.126
Maddie, would you please make

26:25.167 --> 26:27.628
a copy of the video
for Mr. Franzen?

26:27.670 --> 26:30.047
Vincent, I will see you
in the morning.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.340
And be prepared.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.050
