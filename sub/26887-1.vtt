-[Chris, on phone] Hello?
-[on phone] Hi, hey, Chris,
it's Mat.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.711
-[Chris] Mat, how you doing?
-[Mat] I'm good.
Can you talk?

00:15.885 --> 00:18.366
[Chris] Yeah, it's
a good time. How are you?

00:18.540 --> 00:22.022
[Mat] I'm good, I was just... I was just wondering if you had a chance to see the film yet.

00:22.196 --> 00:25.895
[Chris] Uh, the truth is, Mat, I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it.

00:26.069 --> 00:31.944
I feel like if I see it, I might just wanna remove myself from the film.

00:32.119 --> 00:36.471
-[both laughing] -So, if it's okay with you, could I just trust you on it?

00:36.645 --> 00:38.255
-[Mat] Okay.
-[Chris] If you don't mind.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.127
I just feel like
we've known you for so long

00:40.301 --> 00:42.085
and we trust you
and we love you.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.392
You just make the film
you wanna make

00:44.566 --> 00:47.395
and all I ask is please
could you not open the film

00:47.569 --> 00:49.701
with one of those shots
of the band
walking to the stage,

00:49.875 --> 00:51.834
'cause I feel like
that's been done.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.662
-[Mat] Really?
-[Chris] Yeah.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.403
[Mat] Okay. Well, leave it with me. I'll see what I can do.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.100
-[Chris] Thanks, Mat.
-[Mat] Yeah.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.449
-[Chris] Speak to you soon.
-[Mat] Bye-bye.

01:23.387 --> 01:26.042

01:55.898 --> 01:58.248
[cheering intensifies]

02:06.909 --> 02:10.782
[man through speaker]
I don't want to rule
or conquer anyone.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.741
I should like to help everyone
if possible--

02:12.915 --> 02:16.005
Jew, Gentile, black man, white.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.833
We all want to help one another.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.009
Human beings are like that.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.446
We don't want to hate
or to despise one another.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.015
In this world there's room
for everyone.
The good earth is rich.

02:26.189 --> 02:29.540
For those who can hear me,
I say do not despair.

02:29.714 --> 02:33.109
The hate of men will pass
and dictators die,

02:33.283 --> 02:36.591
and the power they took
from the people
will return to the people.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.549
The kingdom of God
is within men,

02:38.723 --> 02:40.508
not one man, nor a group of men,

02:40.682 --> 02:42.205
but in all men, in you!

02:42.379 --> 02:44.338
You, the people, have the power!

02:44.512 --> 02:47.471
The power to create machines,
the power to create happiness,

02:47.645 --> 02:50.996
you, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful,

02:51.171 --> 02:53.085
to make this life
a wonderful adventure!

02:53.260 --> 02:56.480

03:46.965 --> 03:48.053
[shouts]

04:30.922 --> 04:34.317
[Chris] A Head Full Of Dreams
is somewhere we've been trying
to go for a long time.

04:35.579 --> 04:39.279
The journey has been
so incremental and so episodic,

04:39.453 --> 04:41.498
it's just a mountain
that keeps getting higher.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.631
If I ever turn round
and look down,

04:43.805 --> 04:46.851
I think will I just be amazed
about how on earth we got here?

04:47.025 --> 04:49.114
[singing softly]

04:49.289 --> 04:50.942
[Will] There's not really
a day goes by

04:51.116 --> 04:54.729
that I don't get a reminder
of how very fortunate I am,

04:54.903 --> 04:56.905
first of all,
to have met the other guys

04:57.079 --> 04:59.821
and that things just happened
in the way that they did.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.911
[Jonny] Our friendships
have somehow survived

05:03.085 --> 05:05.957
and stayed quite similar
to how they were.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.220
We've spent half our lives
together now.

05:08.395 --> 05:12.616
I've spent more time with these
people than almost anybody else.
[chuckles]

05:13.008 --> 05:16.272
[Guy] It's more like family,
it's more like brothers,
actually, than friends.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.449
I think we all think about
what we'd be doing
with our lives

05:19.623 --> 05:21.321
if we hadn't met each other.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.801
I mean, it's almost terrifying
thinking about it, really.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.977
[singing softly]

05:28.328 --> 05:29.677
-Cool.
-[man] Nice.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.635
Can you turn the lights down
a tiny bit?

05:33.811 --> 05:35.857
Just this one down a bit.
Thanks, bro.

You know what I mean?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.359
[laughs]That's how it makes me feel.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.579
Dad, I love this song.Thank you, baby.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.539
[chatters]And thank you for saying
what I paid you to say earlier.

07:32.713 --> 07:33.757
[all laughing]

07:35.106 --> 07:36.630
I was saying to the others,

07:36.804 --> 07:39.720
to see things that were recorded
20 years ago, you know,

07:39.894 --> 07:42.679
I had no recollection of anyone
having a camera back then--

07:42.853 --> 07:44.551
is a really strange sensation.

07:44.725 --> 07:48.946
["Brothers and Sisters"
playing on computer]

07:49.120 --> 07:52.602
[Guy] What had become
really distant memories
came flooding back to me.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.562
You know, our lives have changed
in so many ways.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.956
And when I think back
to what our first album was--

07:59.130 --> 08:01.132
You know,
if you listen to Parachutesnow,

08:01.306 --> 08:04.832
it's very acoustic
and it's very small
and it's very intimate.

08:07.225 --> 08:11.708
[singing "We Never Change"]

08:11.882 --> 08:15.407
[Guy] And then if you
fast forward to
A Head Full Of Dreams,

08:15.582 --> 08:17.671
it's a very different thing
altogether.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.804
Looking back at some of the
old footage, underneath it all,

08:20.978 --> 08:24.025
I still see the same people then
as we are today.

08:24.199 --> 08:27.811
To really get the full story,
you've got to go back
to when we met.

08:27.985 --> 08:32.207
I mean, it really does
feel like a lifetime ago.

08:32.381 --> 08:36.733
We were friends for almost
a year before we played
any music together.

08:36.907 --> 08:40.389
We all lived in the same
student halls of residence.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.349
Most people would've found
their bandmates by advertising.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.788
"Drummer required"
in the back of the NME
or something like that.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.140
-Fuck it!
-[Guy] I think in our case,
it was different

08:52.314 --> 08:55.665
because we all really knew
this is the group
that we want to form.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.275
This is who we want to be with.

08:57.449 --> 09:00.017
[vocalizing]

09:00.191 --> 09:02.411
We met at
University College London.

09:02.585 --> 09:06.546
We were all studying
to be in bands. [laughs]

09:15.772 --> 09:16.947
I've been expecting you,
come on in.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.734
Just your Jones person?

09:21.517 --> 09:22.823
Let me show you around.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.347
College was just a sideline,
you know.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.741
I thought it was a good place
to meet people 'cause
I wanted to be in a band.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.352
I got there,
got to this big place,

09:30.526 --> 09:32.310
Ramsay Hall it was called,
Tottenham Court Road.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.488
That block hasn't changed a bit.
That was where we lived.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.882
-Looks quite bucolic now,
doesn't it?
-Yeah.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.232
Didn't look like that
then. [laughs]

09:41.406 --> 09:44.975
I remember the first day
I got here, a tramp was sick
outside my room.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.499
Lots of musicians in this hall,
weren't there?

09:47.674 --> 09:50.633
Five or six bands
were spawned in our year.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.810
There was a lot of sniffing out
at the beginning, wasn't there?

09:53.984 --> 09:55.769
Like, who does what?
Who's a guitarist?

09:55.943 --> 09:59.033
-There was a bass player
on the third floor.
-[students chattering]

09:59.207 --> 10:01.992
Chris was like this massive
ball of energy and hair.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.386
Yeah, I remember he had
very long hair,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.606
quite unlike anyone
I'd ever met before.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.999
I would always be
showing off saying,

10:09.173 --> 10:11.436
"I play songs, I play songs"
to anyone that would listen,
you know?

10:45.557 --> 10:47.298
-and fortunately that was you.
-[Jonny] Hmm.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.737
Back in 1996 when we met,

10:50.911 --> 10:52.913
I didn't think Jonny spoke
at all.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.045
He was just this stoned guy
in the corner

10:55.219 --> 10:57.526
that if you said something
he would just, like, smile.
[laughs]

10:57.700 --> 10:59.702
Yeah, we got on pretty well
straightaway,

10:59.876 --> 11:02.183
but you know,
you can't start playing music
on your first date.

11:02.792 --> 11:06.927
I came to London solely
to find some people to be
in a band with and make music.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.845
I'd wanted to do this
from when I was a small boy,

11:12.019 --> 11:15.152
but you never really imagine
that it's possible.

11:16.588 --> 11:17.981
One day I came into the room
he was in,

11:18.155 --> 11:19.548
and Jonny had a guitar,
and I was like,

11:19.722 --> 11:20.723
"I didn't know
you played guitar."

11:20.897 --> 11:22.029
Then he started playing.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.381
And something in me
was switched.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.296
I was like,
"This is the guy I've been
looking for my whole life."

11:28.470 --> 11:30.559
[man on TV]
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.562
[Chris] Like in
Back to the Future
where Chuck's cousin Marvin

11:34.606 --> 11:37.522
calls Chuck Berry and says,
"I've got that new sound
you're looking for."

11:37.697 --> 11:39.481
Well, listen to this!

11:41.091 --> 11:43.006
[Chris] It was
love at first sight for me.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.487
He took a little longer
to convince.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.320
When I first started playing
with Chris,

11:52.494 --> 11:56.716
I thought, "He's so good,
I think we might do something,"
you know.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.719
[Chris singing
and playing guitar]

12:05.028 --> 12:07.814
[Jonny] Obviously you have
a sense that something
is starting,

12:07.988 --> 12:12.209
but I don't think we had a sense
of what that something was
or where it would end up.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.388
Within a couple of weeks,
we'd asked Guy if he would join.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.001
Me and Guy didn't like
each other at first.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.612
He thought I was weird
'cause I had long curly hair.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.528
I thought he was arrogant,
but he wasn't.
He was just really quiet.

12:26.702 --> 12:29.183
But then we bonded over
a keyboard, so we thought,

12:29.357 --> 12:31.489
"Ah, wicked. Well,
maybe we don't hate each other."

12:32.142 --> 12:34.449
What does it mean to me, music?

12:34.623 --> 12:39.454
It's been my life since I was
probably about five years old.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.024
I found a box of cassettes
my sister had,
and I'll never forget that.

12:44.198 --> 12:49.029
I became a bass player 'cause
of my love of soul and funk.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.944
And that was it, you know.
I'd get home from school

12:51.118 --> 12:53.773
and I would just play that
instrument constantly for hours,

12:53.947 --> 12:55.687
just lock myself away
and play it.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.953
He was the first person
to put his whole life on hold

13:00.127 --> 13:04.653
based on one song
that Jonny and I had played him
on two crappy old guitars.

13:05.654 --> 13:08.048
It just blows my mind
that he did that.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.399
It soon became apparent
that we needed a drummer

13:11.573 --> 13:14.054
if we wanted to play a gig.
[laughs]

13:14.532 --> 13:16.665
[Guy] Chris Martin, these are
your wheels of fortune.

13:16.839 --> 13:20.582
What's up? I'm Cheese Hawk,
I ride for Proco trucks

13:20.756 --> 13:22.497
and Deutschentractors.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.021
We went away for the summer
and at the end of the summer,

13:25.195 --> 13:27.850
we started really writing
some good songs
and we wanted to do a demo.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.592
[Guy] Today we can eat food
that isn't come out of the bin.

13:30.766 --> 13:33.551
-[laughter]
-[chattering, laughing]

13:33.725 --> 13:36.163
[Chris] We were cool in
everything except the drums.
We didn't have a drummer.

13:36.728 --> 13:40.820
So, when we went to do
our first photo shoot
in Tesco's on Oxford Street,

13:41.429 --> 13:43.344
I did mine, Jonny did his,
Guy did his.

13:43.518 --> 13:46.042
So it was just three of us and
it was called the PanicEP.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.176
So, we went down to Will's house

13:49.350 --> 13:51.961
and Will was always our mate
who played guitar
much better than anyone

13:52.135 --> 13:53.745
and knew about 100 songs.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.486
He was a walking jukebox.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.446
I met Chris-- We were
on a bus somewhere together.

13:58.620 --> 14:02.363
We used to play guitars
in the stairwells
'cause they had nice acoustics.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.931
I was at the bottom
of the stairs
and he was on the fifth floor.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.542
A five-story musical experience.

14:08.456 --> 14:13.200
It's a very fundamental
and basic memory that I have
about being a child.

14:13.374 --> 14:17.160
Music was all around.
It's a legacy of my mum's.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.859
I knew that Chris and Jonny
had recorded an EP

14:20.033 --> 14:21.643
and they wanted some drums
on it.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.385
My flatmate played the drums
and he had a drum kit.

14:24.559 --> 14:28.215
We set it all up and then,
when it was ready to go,
he wasn't around.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.999
I think he'd disappeared.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.653
I'm not sure how committed
he was to being in a band.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.829
So, Will said, "I'll do it."

14:34.177 --> 14:35.831
I'm the only one here,
I'm the only one left.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.965
"I'll give it a go" and then
he went... [imitating drums]

14:42.925 --> 14:46.320
I had the same feeling
that I had with Guy and Jonny.
"Oh, that's him. There he is."

14:46.494 --> 14:47.887
We didn't actually know
you were a drummer.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.758
[Will] No, I wasn't.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.456
That's the key, I'm still trying
to convince the world that I am.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.504
[Chris] And Coldplay was born.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.507
It's like when bacon and eggs

14:59.681 --> 15:01.596
and mushrooms and chips

15:01.770 --> 15:03.467
are put on the same plate

15:03.641 --> 15:06.775
and become something greater
than those individual parts.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.865
It becomes
a cohesive whole that's tasty.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.128
Our sound is tasty.

15:12.694 --> 15:16.350
Chris is the unstoppable
creative force of the band

15:16.524 --> 15:18.874
that we try our best
to keep up with.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.530
He's our best friend
and a musical genius

15:22.704 --> 15:25.185
and he never stops
surprising you.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.144
Music means everything to me.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.103
I think when I was about 16,

15:30.277 --> 15:33.193
I was performing and doing music
at boarding school.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.718
And I remember saying to people,
"I'm gonna do this forever."

15:36.892 --> 15:40.591
They were like, "Sure.
And why don't you reanimate
dinosaurs while you're at it?"

15:40.765 --> 15:42.419
You know, it was
that ridiculous.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.118
But I've been really blessed
in my life

15:45.292 --> 15:49.122
with an ability to not give up,
and it came from my dad.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.688
He's the first person
that said it to me,

15:50.862 --> 15:52.342
and would often say it to me,

15:52.516 --> 15:54.170
and I now say it to my son.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.565
My dad is a circus
ringmaster really,

15:57.739 --> 15:59.610
but he was told
to be an accountant.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.526
And in my mum, I could feel
a certain frustration

16:02.700 --> 16:05.529
that she wasn't able to do
what she really loved,
which is music.

16:06.139 --> 16:09.098
So, with both of them,
there was a subconscious thing

16:09.272 --> 16:13.363
that if you really feel that
you're supposed to do something,
go for it.

16:13.537 --> 16:16.236
And it gave me
this great sense of possibility

16:16.801 --> 16:19.587
and then that philosophy
became A Head Full Of Dreams.

16:21.328 --> 16:25.549
He has a relentless
and infectious energy
for music and for life

16:25.723 --> 16:28.074
and it's incredible
to have shared a journey

16:28.248 --> 16:29.989
because we're
very different people.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.383
Chris always has
a very clear idea
about where he wants to be,

16:33.775 --> 16:35.342
what he wants to be doing next.

16:36.386 --> 16:41.478
We, Jon Buckland, Chris Martin,
Will Champion and Guy Berryman,

16:41.652 --> 16:44.525
aka The Coldplay,
are gonna go on
to be such a huge band,

16:44.699 --> 16:49.008
and this will be on national
television within four years,
four years.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.967
This is now 26th June, 1998.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.709
By the 26th of June, 2002,

16:54.883 --> 16:57.668
The Coldplay or the band,
whatever they're called then,

16:57.842 --> 17:00.019
will be known
just all over, man.

17:00.193 --> 17:03.413
-We're gonna be so big.
-[bandmates chattering]

17:03.587 --> 17:06.895
So Guy, Will, Jon, and Chris,
Don't you forget, all right?

17:07.591 --> 17:09.941
Massive. Absolutely huge.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.248
["Politik" playing]

17:46.804 --> 17:49.285
-[song ends]
-[cheering]

17:56.162 --> 17:57.641
Every record is
your first and last.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.382
That's the way
you should really treat it.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.558
We're not under the impression
that we have a right

18:01.732 --> 18:03.952
to just amble
into these massive arenas

18:04.126 --> 18:06.650
and play to the same kind
of numbers that we played to
on the last tour.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.870
We're starting again
at rock bottom.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.220
-Well, not quite rock bottom--
-[Chris] Sort of
drop bottom soft.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.527
-[Will] Yeah.
-[Chris] But that's good,
I think.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.790
As ridiculous as it sounds,
I still feel like
we're trying to make it.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.923
[radio DJ] Hey, our friend
Chris Martin is in studio
with us now.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
And he's from a little band
called Coldplay.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.884
Their new record is called
A Head Full Of Dreams.

18:23.058 --> 18:26.105
Aren't you so delighted, though, when you crawl out of the cave

18:26.279 --> 18:28.933
where you boys make your magic
that the world still cares?

18:29.108 --> 18:32.850
[Chris] Definitely. And
right now we're going on tour
for another 18 months or so.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.504
That's when
the real payoff happens.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.769
You can't take anything
for granted.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.510
As fast as the ascent has been,

18:40.684 --> 18:43.209
the descent can be
four or five times as fast.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.254
Having done like
a week of rehearsing,

18:45.428 --> 18:47.082
we did like a practice gig.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.518
It was basically like
us saying good-bye.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.303
We're going away
for a year and a half.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.218
At the end of it,
I got this overwhelming feeling

18:52.392 --> 18:53.784
that everyone was being
nice about it,

18:53.958 --> 18:56.047
but actually
we sounded absolutely terrible.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.615
We definitely felt like
we had to kind of
earn our stripes again.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.792
Hey, how are you doing?

19:01.966 --> 19:04.621
[radio DJ]
The brand-new album is so
different from the last album.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.407
So much energy,
so much color, so much light.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.758
[Chris] Absolutely. We wanted
to just make the album
we always dreamed of.

19:10.932 --> 19:14.153
But now we're a little nervy, of course, 'cause we don't know what anyone will think.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.416
But it's just like a dream
come true, the whole thing.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.069
This might just work.

19:18.244 --> 19:22.552
[guitar playing]

19:22.726 --> 19:24.728
It was just time for us
to make an album

19:24.902 --> 19:27.688
about hope and love
and togetherness,

19:27.862 --> 19:29.690
you know,
embracing all the sounds
that we love

19:29.864 --> 19:31.518
and all the styles that we like.

19:32.345 --> 19:35.174
I think some people will
just say, "Oh, fuck off.
This is hippy nonsense."

19:35.348 --> 19:36.740
But that's okay.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.264
This is the first tour where
we feel like,

19:38.438 --> 19:40.091
yeah, that's how we want
it to be.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.790
I think every other tour
up to this one has been,

19:42.964 --> 19:45.793
"One day we'll have this kind
of song and production."

19:45.967 --> 19:47.751
This Head Full of Dreams
tour is the first time

19:47.925 --> 19:49.884
we've got what we were
always hoping for.

19:50.058 --> 19:53.888
-["Amazing Day" playing]
-[sings]

20:38.367 --> 20:41.936
[female interviewer]
There's four of you in the band.
Who's in charge? Who's the boss?

20:42.110 --> 20:44.373
[Chris]We have a fifth member
called Phil.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.289
Nobody sees him
because he's too good-looking,

20:47.463 --> 20:50.031
and he pulls all the strings.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.468
-[interviewer] Does he actually
exist?
-Phil is real.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.601
I would like
to rephrase that.Phil is real.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.517
He's--
Can you not see him?

20:57.691 --> 20:59.475
He's sitting right there.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.521
He's next to Guy.
He doesn't speak much.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.479
No, he doesn't show up on TV.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.830
So, Phil Harvey was our
first manager.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.616
He paid for us to record
our first EP.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.662
He's a sort of outsider
on the inside.

21:12.836 --> 21:17.058
He's able to view with
a much better perspective
than sometimes we can.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.060
The difference between
having four and five people

21:19.234 --> 21:23.020
in a democracy
is actually crucial,
because someone will win.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.022
You don't get a stalemate.

21:25.414 --> 21:29.026
It's probably even healthier
than a democracy
because no one can be voted out.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.680
There's no elections.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.727
It's like a democratic
five-way dictatorship.

21:33.901 --> 21:34.945
[Chris chuckles]

21:35.119 --> 21:37.034
So, how much for--400 each.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.949
400 each?Yes, sir.

21:39.123 --> 21:42.257
What?You make it done sir,
three pieces for...

21:42.431 --> 21:44.477
1,000 four.Let's call it 600.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.131
Take. 1,000.That's terrible negotiating.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.003
[all laughing]

21:49.525 --> 21:52.485
The important thing
when you're in a new city
is not to look like a tourist.

21:52.659 --> 21:53.660
Right, Phil?Just blend in.

21:53.834 --> 21:54.922
Just make sure
you're prepared

21:55.096 --> 21:56.227
for any eventuality.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.708
Yeah, be safe
and be discreet and...

21:58.882 --> 22:01.145
I think we'll be okay.All right?

22:01.320 --> 22:04.845
So, me and Chris, we got sent
to the same boarding school
when we were 13.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.762
That was how we met, and, uh,
he's been my best friend
ever since.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.982
I think, subconsciously,
I spent a long time,

22:12.156 --> 22:14.028
almost in denial
of my upbringing.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.378
I was raised very religious,

22:16.857 --> 22:18.989
so there's a sort of
constant self-doubt.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.776
I came from a very
small school in Devon

22:22.950 --> 22:25.822
and then went to this
much bigger school in Dorset.

22:25.996 --> 22:29.217
There, I realized,
"Oh, this is gonna be tough."

22:29.391 --> 22:30.740
In retrospect,
it was great preparation

22:30.914 --> 22:34.570
for being in Coldplay,
the abuse. [laughs]

22:34.744 --> 22:37.660
I think people
were pretty fucking mean to him.

22:37.834 --> 22:41.577
I think there was also a
certain vulnerability about him.

22:41.751 --> 22:45.494
There was a few guys in my year
who seemed to have it
a bit more together

22:45.668 --> 22:47.540
and were twice as big
as everybody else,

22:47.714 --> 22:50.717
and one of them was this guy
Phil with the most perfect hair.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.067
And he basically took pity
on me, I think.

22:53.850 --> 22:57.767
We were in a couple
of bands together at school,
but I never lasted long.

22:57.941 --> 23:01.423
I wanted it so badly,
but I just had zero talent.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.860
Our blues band
was called the Rocking Honkies,

23:04.034 --> 23:05.775
and it was as bad as it sounds.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.212
[man] We're gonna go backstage
with the Honkies.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.692
Add your comments on it.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.434
Well, Tim, we're the
rocking, tonking,

23:12.608 --> 23:16.220
rocking, tonking,
rocking, fucking honkies.

23:16.395 --> 23:20.747
[blues music playing]

23:20.921 --> 23:23.706
-Chris Martin on the piano!
-[audience cheering, whistling]

23:23.880 --> 23:28.494
We know each other so well now
that we know what buttons
not to push.

23:28.668 --> 23:32.323
Honestly, I feel better friends
with the four of them now
than I ever have.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.630
Chris kind of explained it
to me the other day,

23:34.804 --> 23:37.590
'cause we had a band meeting,
and he said,
"It's really nice nowadays,

23:37.764 --> 23:40.941
I know when I don't have to say
anything 'cause I know when
Will's gonna say something,

23:41.115 --> 23:42.595
I know when Guy's gonna
say something."

23:42.769 --> 23:45.424
So, major disagreements
are rare.

23:46.163 --> 23:49.819
We've had our moments as a
band, but we came through them.

23:49.993 --> 23:53.910
A four-way marriage
is a tricky proposition.
[laughs]

23:54.084 --> 23:57.610
It's difficult because we work
so hard on keeping each other
happy, the four of us.

23:57.784 --> 24:00.395
But sometimes
things do need to be said,

24:00.569 --> 24:03.703
and I've learnt over the years
that that has to be me,

24:03.877 --> 24:07.663
the sort of unofficial
"spanner in the works thrower."

24:12.625 --> 24:15.105
What songs are going
on A Head Full Of Dreams?

24:15.279 --> 24:16.803
I think we all agree that...

24:17.891 --> 24:19.370
we might not all be
in agreement.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.981
[all laughing]

24:21.155 --> 24:24.114
[Will] But I think there are
eight songs

24:24.288 --> 24:27.596
which I would like to think
that we won't have
any disagreement about.

24:27.770 --> 24:30.686
-Yes.
-This might be too much for me.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.645
[Will] Okay.[simultaneous talking]

24:32.819 --> 24:36.736
I'm worried that we might be
about to really piss
each other off.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.173
We've gotta be honest.
This week we can't...

24:39.347 --> 24:43.264
-We have to have this.
-All right. What are they?

24:43.438 --> 24:46.136
My feeling is
"Hymn for the Weekend."

24:46.310 --> 24:48.356
-All agreed? Agreed?
-[Phil] Agreed.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.792
-[Chris] Carried, carried.
-[Phil] Yeah.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.446
[band playfully mocking]"Everglow"?

24:51.620 --> 24:53.840
Agreed.[band members laughing]

24:54.014 --> 24:55.406
"Amazing Day."

24:55.581 --> 24:57.147
[mutters][Jonny laughing]

25:01.108 --> 25:04.372
But I don't wanna be a dick.
My part is to keep
the band together.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.635
[Will] Of course, but...I'll do whatever you say.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.855
[Will] I'm not gonna walk out
of the band just because--

25:09.029 --> 25:11.118
So, that is on the definites.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.511
"Up and Up."That's on my definites.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.817
[Jonny] I would like it
on there.

25:14.991 --> 25:19.169
It has to be, really,
because that's an example
of a crucial story bit.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.694
Well, we've definitely
made an EP.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.872
None of us are
particularly confrontational,

25:26.046 --> 25:28.483
but sometimes
it can absolutely be fraught

25:28.657 --> 25:30.093
and there are
definitely arguments.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.747
Everybody has a say, you know,

25:31.921 --> 25:34.881
that's the foundation
of our band really, is equality.

25:35.055 --> 25:38.058
We decided that
down in Camden from the outset.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.451
This is our area.
This is our area.

25:41.496 --> 25:42.758
I'll show ya.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.586
Just over there,
that road up there.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.807
Just up here is where it
all happened. It's our Cavern.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.373
This is where it began.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.984
-[Jonny] Camden?
-[Chris] Yeah, at Camden.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.682
[Jonny] Beginning of
rock legend.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.728
-[Jonny] This was it.
-[Will] Wow.

25:55.902 --> 25:56.990
So...

25:57.164 --> 25:58.731
-[Jonny] 268.
-[Will] Yeah.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.863
-[Jonny] Been repainted.
-[Will] Looks a lot nicer.

26:01.995 --> 26:06.173
This is where
we first started rehearsing
when Will first joined the band.

26:06.347 --> 26:09.306
My old flat
where Chris and I used to live.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.309
[Jonny] We are in Camden Road,
we're The Coldplay.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.007
[Chris] Come on through,
I'll show you.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.096
-[Jonny] There goes Guy.
-[Chris] To the left down there.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.926
-[Will] Who lived in there?
-[Jonny] This was Chris's room.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.450
-[Jonny] We played in here.
-[Will] Yeah.

26:22.885 --> 26:25.018
Basically we go through
a simple stretch routine

26:25.192 --> 26:26.715
while singing
some songs as well.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.499
I don't know if you can see
that where you are.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.764
This was Jonny's bedroom
and our band rehearsal room.

26:31.938 --> 26:35.811
Uh, Chris and I
normally stand together.
We raise the right arm.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.597
Right one.Just bring it round
to the side.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.729
[laughing][chattering]

26:40.903 --> 26:42.775
Did you just get
your arse out, Jonny?

26:42.949 --> 26:45.168
-[Will] It's pretty small,
isn't it?
-[Jonny] It really is.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.431
For a full band and a bed.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.478
[Jonny] It's funny to think
that it all stemmed
from this bedroom.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.395
[Will] A few days after
the PanicEP, we had
our first rehearsal

26:54.569 --> 26:57.093
and on that evening,
I phoned up this promoter

26:57.267 --> 26:59.792
at the Laurel Tree in Camden
and said, "Can we have a gig?"

26:59.966 --> 27:01.924
Thinking it might be
in six, eight weeks' time.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.100
[laughs]
He said, "Yeah, next Sunday."

27:04.274 --> 27:07.408
-[Jonny laughing]
-"What's your name?"
"We haven't got one yet."

27:07.582 --> 27:10.193
That was it.
We had to think of a name
'cause we were printing flyers.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.935
So, we came up
with a really terrible name.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.069
There's an old piece of paper
that Chris has.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.245
It's like a list of things
for the band.

27:18.419 --> 27:20.116
One is to get a drummer.
[laughs]

27:20.290 --> 27:23.554
Gig one, gig two, gig three,
gig four, get signed.

27:24.468 --> 27:27.776
It wasn't until Phil came along
that things started to change.

27:28.472 --> 27:31.040
I was always going down
to visit Chris down in London

27:31.214 --> 27:33.695
and I would share a bed
with Jonny.

27:33.869 --> 27:37.351
Obviously I came down
for the first show
when they were Star Fish.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.225
It was in a total dive
in Camden.

27:47.535 --> 27:50.625
[singing]

27:50.799 --> 27:54.107
Our first gig in
the Laurel Tree was, I think,

27:54.281 --> 27:57.893
probably the most
terrifying experience
I've ever had in my life.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.288
I felt so sick before it.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.031
I've never been so nervous,
I don't think.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.598
We expected about 20 people.

28:07.773 --> 28:11.298
It was sold out and we thought,
"Wow, this is a bit weird."

28:12.255 --> 28:15.563
That's the great thing
about college, you know.
It made us look popular.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.131
Whereas, in fact,
they were just there to pull.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.698
[Jonny] It's really small,
isn't it?

28:19.872 --> 28:21.569
My pedal board
wouldn't fit on this stage.

28:22.396 --> 28:25.138
-[Will] It's fantastic, though.
-[Jonny] It doesn't feel like
20 years ago.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.315
[Jonny] We did a couple of gigs
here, didn't we?

28:28.489 --> 28:31.361
[Will] I think this was just
one without a drum kit.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.668
Yeah. The band that was
supporting us had a kit,

28:33.842 --> 28:36.105
and so we asked them
if we could use theirs
and they said yes,

28:36.279 --> 28:38.281
but then the promoter cut
their set short.

28:38.455 --> 28:41.589
Yeah. They got quite cross
and they took their kit home.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.852
I was pleading with them,
"Please, don't take it.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.072
This is only
our second-ever show."

28:56.822 --> 28:59.694
Absolutely terrifying
in every way,
but incredible and wonderful.

28:59.868 --> 29:04.394
Our second gig as people,
but our first gig as Coldplay.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.919
-The Coldplay.
-Oh, The Coldplay, yeah.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.529
Where did our name come from?

29:08.703 --> 29:10.792
A friend of ours
had a band called Coldplay,

29:10.966 --> 29:15.014
and they decided they didn't
like the name,
so we just stole it.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.973
They said it was a rubbish name
and they didn't want it anymore.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.759
Turned out to be a really hard
word to pronounce to people.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.457
You say you're in a band.
"What's the band called?"
Coldplay.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.894
"What Goldblade? Cold Cut?"

29:26.068 --> 29:28.723
-It's really hard. [laughs]
-Gold Blend.

29:28.897 --> 29:31.770
I still don't feel that
we've quite got the name right,

29:31.944 --> 29:35.121
[laughing]
but I think we might be
a bit late to change it.

29:35.295 --> 29:38.341
Every show seemed
like a milestone really.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.604
I remember the feeling
and the buzz in these rooms,

29:40.779 --> 29:44.173
the sweat dripping off
the ceiling,
smoke, and the sticky floors.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.610
The toilet circuit,
as it's known,

29:46.785 --> 29:49.962
that kind of made us realize,
this is gonna be hard work.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.616
You do have to put
the time and effort into it.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.141
We were prepared to do that
for as long as it took,

29:55.315 --> 29:57.360
just carrying on
and getting skanked

29:57.534 --> 30:00.799
by money-grabbing,
shady Camden promoters.

30:00.973 --> 30:03.584
I think in the back of my head,
I must've been thinking,

30:03.758 --> 30:05.934
"Yeah, I'd like to be
involved in this."

30:06.108 --> 30:08.632
And then I remember
Chris telling me how
they were getting ripped off,

30:08.807 --> 30:11.635
and I thought,
"Maybe I could do a better job."

30:11.810 --> 30:14.421
He dropped out of university
to come and manage us,

30:14.595 --> 30:17.076
which was an extraordinarily
selfless move.

30:17.250 --> 30:19.469
Then it went to the next level.

30:19.643 --> 30:22.124
[Chris] Deep in the lair
of rock and roll,
we find Mr. William Champion.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.039
-Bit nervous?
-Uh, little bit.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.607
-[Chris]Where's the
Harvey character?
-Where?

30:26.781 --> 30:29.218
I think I took it
pretty seriously
from the moment I came on board.

30:29.392 --> 30:33.048
I had a book, I remember
called "How to Manage a Band."

30:33.222 --> 30:35.311
I had the longest list of people
to approach,

30:35.485 --> 30:39.098
but no one wanted
to take my call
and I was quite down on myself.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.579
I think what kept us going was
the songs kept getting better,

30:42.753 --> 30:44.494
the shows kept getting better.

30:44.668 --> 30:47.106
I think Chris always had enough
self-belief for all of us,

30:47.280 --> 30:48.934
you know what I mean?

30:49.108 --> 30:51.501
The Falcon was the first time
that Steve Lamacq came.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.678
Fuck me. Steve Lamacq's
in the audience,
so we're, like, wow.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.594
He's like the Yoda of radio
in Britain.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.945
He came to us
before anybody else.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.861
I couldn't believe it.
I started sweating.
Steve Lamacq, Steve Lamacq.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.558
I remember Lamacq calling me.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.386
"Phil, this is
the first time
I've ever offered

31:06.560 --> 31:09.171
a Radio 1
evening session
to an unsigned act.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.781
Are you guys up for it?"

31:10.956 --> 31:12.218
-Sorry, mate, thank you.
-Cheers.

31:12.392 --> 31:16.091
Got accosted
by some autograph hunters.

31:16.265 --> 31:19.007
They weren't looking
for our autograph. They were
looking for Bryan Ferry's.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.530
Apparently, he lives round here.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.279
[Lamacq]
It'sLamacq Live from Radio 1,

31:30.453 --> 31:32.760
and we can go across now
to our Maida Vale studios.

31:32.934 --> 31:35.023
Hello, Coldplay?

31:35.197 --> 31:36.764
-[Chris] Hello, Steve.
-[Will] All right, Steve.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.418
[Lamacq] You had a single out,
didn't you?

31:38.592 --> 31:40.072
I didn't even know
you had a record out.

31:40.246 --> 31:42.117
[Chris] We put it
in your pigeonhole.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.075
-You didn't listen to it,
you bastard.
-[laughter]

31:43.249 --> 31:44.946
I'm not gonna say that.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.818
[Lamacq] What's the first song
you're gonna do?

31:47.993 --> 31:49.646
[Chris] We're gonna do a song
called "Bigger Stronger,"
which was our single in May.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.474
[Lamacq] It might've passed
people by.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.781
All right, it's Coldplay then,
live on Radio 1.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.174
[Chris] Thank you, Steve.

31:55.348 --> 31:58.090
["Bigger Stronger" playing]

32:13.714 --> 32:15.629
It was a really intense
period of time

32:15.803 --> 32:18.719
because we were so determined
to not fail.

32:18.893 --> 32:21.287
We just weren't gonna give up
until we got somewhere

32:21.461 --> 32:24.029
and made an album
and got a record deal.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.161
I could tell the songs--
they were real songs,

32:26.335 --> 32:28.120
and I just thought,

32:28.294 --> 32:30.600
"Okay, this could be something
that becomes part of my life."

32:30.774 --> 32:33.777
And then within a few weeks,
it was everything.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.825
I was in the bathroom
in my mum and dad's house,

32:37.999 --> 32:39.000
reading the NME.

32:39.174 --> 32:41.829
It said
"20 New Bands for 1999."

32:42.003 --> 32:44.136
And sure enough
there was Muse, Elbow,

32:44.310 --> 32:46.181
Gay Dad, Bellatrix,

32:46.355 --> 32:48.705
and then it came to Coldplay
and I fainted, basically.

32:48.879 --> 32:50.881
Yeah, Chris fell off the toilet.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.841
I basically had a Doc Brown
from Back to the Future
moment.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.061
And I called Will,
I called Jon, I called Guy.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.932
I was like,
"Have you seen this?"

32:58.106 --> 33:00.891
It said, "Bigger Stronger"
was their no-key debut release.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.938
Expect copies of it
to be worth a small mortgage
come Christmas."

33:04.112 --> 33:05.548
Fucking hell, man.

33:05.722 --> 33:08.377
One paragraph changed
our entire lives.

33:08.551 --> 33:11.946
The next show after
that NMEtip--

33:12.120 --> 33:14.775
I just remember it
being rammed wall-to-wall.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.693
[Phil] Things happened
really quick after that.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.130
Loads of different
record companies, the ones
that had stonewalled me,

33:22.304 --> 33:24.611
they all came back and said,
"Oh, found your demo again."

33:24.785 --> 33:25.916
It was amazing.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.702
Yeah, April 15, 1999,

33:28.876 --> 33:30.878
we signed, didn't we,
in Trafalgar Square.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.707
We got loads of offers,
but it was always gonna
be Parlophone,

33:33.881 --> 33:35.361
the home of the Beatles.

33:35.535 --> 33:38.103
And they had Radiohead,
they had Supergrass.

33:38.277 --> 33:39.582
I remember it very well,

33:39.756 --> 33:41.497
the feeling of,
"We have something now."

33:41.671 --> 33:45.849
But it goes back to Chris's
list. It was a tick done.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.026
Now let's get on
with the important work.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.202
I definitely don't remember

33:50.376 --> 33:52.682
it being a sense of,
wow, we've made it.

33:52.856 --> 33:55.381
It was more like a sense of,
okay, this is the beginning.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.904
[cheering]

33:59.863 --> 34:01.430
Yeah, boys.

34:27.326 --> 34:30.459
We did our first UK tour
with seven guys on a bus.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.766
We couldn't believe our luck.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.595
It's amazing to still
be doing the same thing
almost 20 years later.

34:42.776 --> 34:43.733
It's been a constant evolution.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.605
So, it doesn't feel like

34:45.779 --> 34:48.086
we've suddenly jumped from
playing a small pub in Camden

34:48.260 --> 34:50.740
to a massive stadium
in Saão Paulo.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.786
I think sometimes
it's that gradual process

34:52.960 --> 34:55.919
that clouds your feeling
of quite how far you've come.

35:03.013 --> 35:06.365
[Guy]
But the scale of things going on
around us is absolutely immense.

35:06.539 --> 35:07.801
[Chris]
Hoppy, where's Hoppy gone?

35:07.975 --> 35:10.064
Would you come up
on stage a second?

35:10.238 --> 35:12.849
Everyone, this is Hoppy,
he's been doing
our guitars for 20 years.

35:17.419 --> 35:20.335
He's been with us since
we were traveling around
in a tiny little van,

35:20.509 --> 35:23.556
smaller than this stage
and playing to maybe 20 people.

35:23.730 --> 35:26.907
And all that time he's been
with us and been patient,
and so have a lot of our crew,

35:27.081 --> 35:28.735
and we wanna send love out
to them

35:28.909 --> 35:31.390
because they work so hard
to make this thing possible.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.175
The crew have been incredible.

35:34.349 --> 35:36.830
There's been a handful
that have been with us
from the very beginning.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.876
They're legends within
the industry now,

35:40.050 --> 35:41.878
which is wonderful.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.881
[Chris] Everyone has
this conception of us,

35:45.055 --> 35:47.797
sort of like we've been made up
by a big record company,

35:47.971 --> 35:49.495
like some sort
of indie boy band,

35:49.669 --> 35:51.758
but we've done it all
ourselves really.

35:51.932 --> 35:55.936
Our manager's our best mate,
and we produce the record.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.416
That's what we get a buzz off,

35:57.590 --> 35:59.809
is the sort of homemade-ness
of it.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.594
But no one really sees that

36:01.768 --> 36:04.118
'cause they see the slick
TV adverts and stuff.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.513
So what other lyrics
could go on T-shirts?

36:07.687 --> 36:11.995
It'd be a bit morose to have
"We never change, do we?"
Wouldn't it?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.259
That would be funny
if you wore it all the time.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.869
[laughter]

36:16.261 --> 36:19.699
"Can anybody fly this thing?"[Chris] Good one, Hops.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.744
[Jonny] That's my favorite line
of any of our songs.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.093
Yeah, same.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.791
When you're on your first album,

36:24.965 --> 36:28.838
a 14.99 WHSmith globe is
about as big as production gets.

36:29.012 --> 36:32.102
But now we have, like,
a multimedia, 3-D thing.

36:32.755 --> 36:33.930
[Will] What's the scale?

36:34.104 --> 36:35.932
[Chris] One to one.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.196
So, the real thing
will be bigger?[Will] Twice the size.

36:38.370 --> 36:39.893
Twice the size.At least.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.851
[Chris] So, these are
the tickets we've sold.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.592
[Guy] Pretty much everyone's
still there.

36:43.766 --> 36:46.682
We've just kinda kept
adding people along the way,

36:46.856 --> 36:48.206
one big family.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.685
Musically in the past,

36:49.859 --> 36:51.426
I think we felt
a lot of pressure

36:51.600 --> 36:53.515
to have everything
come from the four of us.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.300
We started collaborating
with people

36:55.474 --> 36:58.172
just 'cause it opened up
a new way of making music.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.347
[Chris]

37:01.567 --> 37:03.438
[woman]

37:04.178 --> 37:06.398
[both singing]

37:08.138 --> 37:09.749
Can they film this?Course.

37:09.923 --> 37:12.360
-[Will] It's Chris's phone.
-[laughs]

37:12.534 --> 37:16.799
[Chris and Beyoncé singing
"Hymn for the Weekend"]

37:16.973 --> 37:19.019
We still have
that homemade philosophy,

37:19.193 --> 37:22.414
but now we have
a very open door policy.

37:22.588 --> 37:25.155
Basically if you show up,
you might get a shot. [chuckles]

37:25.330 --> 37:29.072
But it helps if
you're, like, a legend. [laughs]

37:31.423 --> 37:33.251
Oh, that sounds so great.Thank you.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.253
Let's just do
that right now.Okay.

37:35.427 --> 37:36.819
[Chris] The studio we recorded
with Beyoncé

37:36.993 --> 37:38.604
was actually my son's bedroom,

37:38.778 --> 37:40.954
so we had to make it look like
a studio a little bit.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.999
He wants me to do it
softer again.

37:43.304 --> 37:46.351
[Chris] And just make her feel
as special as she is.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.008
["Hymn for the Weekend" playing]

38:17.207 --> 38:18.818
["Hymn for the Weekend"
continues]

38:47.150 --> 38:48.630
It might be strange
for some people

38:48.804 --> 38:50.371
that Stargate are
producing a song

38:50.545 --> 38:53.461
which Noel Gallagher's on,
that Beyoncé is also on.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.768
Even for me it took a while
to get my head around it.

38:56.246 --> 38:59.424
Oasis was such a pivotal band
for us in the mid-'90s.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.263
[Chris]
So, it was just like, this is
called A Head Full of Dreams.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.222
It should be about
making dreams come true.

39:15.396 --> 39:18.573
And one of our dreams was
to have Noel play on something.

39:33.327 --> 39:35.982
Noel Gallagher, by his own
admission, is a bit of a grump

39:36.156 --> 39:39.725
and doesn't share my worldview
in any way at all.

39:39.899 --> 39:42.597
That's the whole point
of the album. It's like,
everyone's all right,

39:42.771 --> 39:45.557
even the people
that don't really like
the concept of this album

39:45.731 --> 39:47.994
have shown up to play on it.
[laughing]

39:48.168 --> 39:49.735
So, thank you, Noel.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.738
[Mat] I noticed that
your kids were credited.

39:52.912 --> 39:55.131
[Chris] Right,
for better or worse,

39:55.305 --> 39:57.612
if you want your kids
to appear on your album
you have to strike a deal.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.397
First of all, they have
to like the song.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.095
Second of all, there has to be
maybe a pizza involved.

40:02.269 --> 40:03.836
It's basically bribery.

40:04.010 --> 40:05.707
-That was so beautiful.
-[applause]

40:05.881 --> 40:07.317
Generally with
A Head Full of Dreams,

40:07.492 --> 40:09.450
we just asked anyone who was
around if they would sing.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.757
We wanted to try and embrace
all the things that we love

40:11.931 --> 40:13.672
and the people
that we think are awesome.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.848
Just the idea of inclusivity.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.895
["Everglow" playing]

40:27.294 --> 40:29.165
["Everglow" continues]

41:16.778 --> 41:18.998
[cheers and applause]

41:21.783 --> 41:24.786
[woman] You started off
as four friends just
playing together,

41:24.960 --> 41:27.485
and you became the biggest
rock band in the world.

41:27.659 --> 41:31.184
I was wondering, what did
you lose in that process?

41:31.358 --> 41:33.621
-Our drummer.
-[laughter]

41:35.362 --> 41:38.234
Very early on, I learnt
that without the five of us,

41:38.408 --> 41:40.193
we just can't be Coldplay.

41:40.367 --> 41:43.109
I lost sight of
what makes a band a band.

41:43.283 --> 41:46.242
The only thing we have going
for us is the friendship.

41:46.982 --> 41:49.594
And the course of our band
could've dramatically changed

41:49.768 --> 41:52.814
because we basically kicked
Will out.

41:53.423 --> 41:56.122
It was kind of like the darkest
and worst point

41:56.296 --> 41:57.950
in our time together.

41:59.038 --> 42:01.780
The excitement,
everything we'd done
was focused on getting signed.

42:01.954 --> 42:03.521
We got signed and thought,
"Oh, God."

42:03.695 --> 42:05.479
Yeah, what do we do now?

42:06.436 --> 42:09.222
[Will] I got to a certain point
whereby I didn't know enough
about how to play the drums

42:09.396 --> 42:11.920
in order to keep up
with the music
that was being written.

42:17.360 --> 42:20.320
[Will] I certainly wasn't
good enough to go through
the rigors of recording.

42:22.801 --> 42:25.543
Shall we leave it and
go on to another one?Yeah.

42:25.717 --> 42:29.459
We were working with a producer
that was very meticulous
about perfection.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.245
And it was all about, "Will's
drumming isn't up to scratch."

42:32.419 --> 42:35.335
And we believed it,
you know, we believed it.

42:36.336 --> 42:37.729
Things got very difficult.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.252
Chris and I had a...

42:39.426 --> 42:43.125
I left the band,
which was absolutely miserable.

42:43.299 --> 42:45.650
I was just a bit of
a dick to Will,

42:45.824 --> 42:48.696
and, you know, we didn't know
what we were doing.

42:48.870 --> 42:53.396
So, Will left,
and we did some auditions.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.485
And I think probably
doing those auditions,

42:55.660 --> 42:59.054
it really kind of struck us
that this was awful.

42:59.228 --> 43:02.928
I just woke up and I was like,
"This is totally wrong."

43:03.102 --> 43:07.497
You know, we said, "Look,
please will you come back?"
Um...

43:07.672 --> 43:09.021
And thank God he did.

43:09.195 --> 43:10.892
If we'd gone down
a different path,

43:11.066 --> 43:14.026
I just know that we would have
at some point failed.

43:25.211 --> 43:26.429
[Chris laughing]

43:26.604 --> 43:28.475
This is it.Woof!

43:28.649 --> 43:30.259
Coldplay![shouting]

43:30.433 --> 43:32.610
I am glad it happened

43:32.784 --> 43:35.090
because I think it was
an incredibly important lesson

43:35.264 --> 43:38.528
as to what we should
hold on to most of all.

43:38.703 --> 43:41.575
[Chris]
This is what we started, this
is what we're gonna continue.

43:41.749 --> 43:43.098
Will, Will.

43:43.272 --> 43:45.231
The drummer always gets
a lot of stick,

43:45.405 --> 43:48.060
if you'll excuse
the turn of phrase.

43:48.234 --> 43:53.021
If I've got any advice
to give to any aspiring bands,

43:53.195 --> 43:56.590
it's just don't fuck around
with your drummer.

43:56.764 --> 44:00.986
A band is a magic thing,
and everyone improves together.

44:01.160 --> 44:04.119
That's what's since given
Will his power.

44:04.293 --> 44:06.513
He's like the base of a statue,

44:06.687 --> 44:09.472
and without that,
the thing topples.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.432
The truth of it is that,
really, without the other three,

44:12.606 --> 44:14.913
each of us would be
kind of screwed.

44:16.175 --> 44:18.133
I just couldn't do it on my own.

44:19.221 --> 44:20.658
I couldn't do it.

44:27.273 --> 44:28.666
Jonny.Yeah.

44:28.840 --> 44:30.972
["Freak Me" by Silk playing
on cell phone]

44:34.628 --> 44:36.499
Great track.I love that.

44:44.464 --> 44:45.639
Well...

44:49.948 --> 44:51.123
This is great.

44:53.255 --> 44:54.953
Great. Thanks.

44:55.127 --> 44:58.043
Do you want us
to speak French?Yeah, that would be wonderful.

45:00.741 --> 45:03.744
Parachuteswas made at a time
when we had a lot of emotions

45:03.918 --> 45:07.313
without necessarily knowing
what they were
or how to deal with them.

45:07.487 --> 45:09.358
Will's mum was really sick.

45:09.532 --> 45:11.752
None of us had any idea
how to help him through that.

45:11.926 --> 45:14.015
He didn't know how
to express it.

45:14.189 --> 45:17.758
She was ill for a couple
of years and doing really well,
in fact, got much better

45:17.932 --> 45:19.978
and then unfortunately,
got much worse again.

45:20.152 --> 45:23.111
And it's a very strange time.

45:23.285 --> 45:25.157
She was in bands.
She loved music.

45:25.331 --> 45:26.724
It was her life, you know.

45:26.898 --> 45:29.335
It's telling that where
I went was to go

45:29.509 --> 45:31.250
and hang out with the band.

45:31.424 --> 45:34.296
I went up to their flat
and told them what was going on.

45:34.470 --> 45:37.430
I didn't really have any
kind of tools to deal with it,

45:37.604 --> 45:41.739
I think I just threw myself
into this extraordinary new life
that I had.

45:41.913 --> 45:44.654
I mean, it's obviously
massively significant

45:44.829 --> 45:46.700
when you lose a parent anyway,

45:46.874 --> 45:49.398
but definitely more poignant
for the fact

45:49.572 --> 45:51.923
that it was something that
she was so passionate about.

45:52.097 --> 45:54.316
She died in May of 2000,

45:54.490 --> 45:57.015
and our album was released
in July of that year.

45:58.146 --> 46:00.148
You're speaking to us
in quite a nervous state

46:00.322 --> 46:02.629
because we're just
approaching crunch time.

46:02.803 --> 46:06.024
It's kinda make-or-break for us
in the next two weeks.

46:06.198 --> 46:07.982
We'd had quite a hard time
in the studio

46:08.156 --> 46:11.029
and our confidence
was kind of wavering a bit.

46:11.203 --> 46:12.944
We didn't really know
what we were doing

46:13.118 --> 46:16.121
and we didn't really know what
sort of band we wanted to be.

46:16.295 --> 46:18.427
We almost split up over
those songs.

46:18.601 --> 46:20.690
The amount of times
we'd play and go,
"That was really good,"

46:20.865 --> 46:23.432
and then we'd listen to it
and one of us would get upset.

46:24.477 --> 46:25.695
Chris called us in and said,

46:25.870 --> 46:27.872
"Listen to this,
I've got this new song."

46:28.046 --> 46:30.744
And it was kind of acoustic-y
and sounded a bit like
Neil Young,

46:30.918 --> 46:32.659
slow and countryish.

46:34.443 --> 46:36.489
Jonny played
a big, distorted riff over it

46:36.663 --> 46:38.143
and then it was born, really.

46:38.317 --> 46:41.755
["Yellow" playing]

46:41.929 --> 46:44.018
We went through hell
recording that album.

46:44.192 --> 46:48.196
But when our confidence
or our enthusiasm was waning,

46:48.370 --> 46:51.243
it'd always be Chris
that was like,
"We've gotta get this right."

46:52.635 --> 46:55.464
We care about we do
to a stupid degree.

46:55.638 --> 46:57.379
We care when people slag us off.

46:57.553 --> 46:59.860
We care about being told we're
not this and we're not that.

47:00.034 --> 47:01.993
There were so many
miserable hours in the studio,

47:02.167 --> 47:03.864
but it was all worth it
in the end.

47:04.038 --> 47:06.867
I didn't push for it in any way,
but it was a lovely gesture

47:07.041 --> 47:09.914
that the guys wanted
to put a little line
in the album sleeve

47:10.088 --> 47:13.178
about the album
being dedicated to my mum.

47:13.352 --> 47:15.484
So, I'm grateful for that

47:15.658 --> 47:18.183
and it's something that
she would've been very proud of.

47:18.357 --> 47:20.359
["Yellow" continues]

47:22.404 --> 47:26.147
All right, our album's out!
Our album's out!

47:26.321 --> 47:28.541
We never thought we'd see
the day, to be honest.

47:29.934 --> 47:32.501
["Yellow" playing]

47:37.811 --> 47:40.858
[man] Times are not that great these days, but there is a beacon of light now and again.

47:41.032 --> 47:42.729
The album itself is
calledParachutes,

47:42.903 --> 47:45.253
the single is "Yellow,"
and the band is Coldplay.

47:45.427 --> 47:47.603
[man]

47:47.777 --> 47:50.389
Two boxes of Kitekat,
Coldplay Parachutes,

47:50.563 --> 47:53.261
some Hobnobs. Please.

47:53.435 --> 47:56.264
["Yellow" continues]

48:09.974 --> 48:14.326
Mat, hi, it's day one
of this one-day video shoot.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.067
I feel good. I feel skinny.

48:23.639 --> 48:26.555
[man] Another
Top of the Pops debut now
for four London lads

48:26.729 --> 48:28.601
fresh from their very first headline tour.

48:28.775 --> 48:29.950
This is Coldplay.

48:30.124 --> 48:32.953
["Yellow" continues]

48:33.127 --> 48:36.870
[man] You guys sold over 35,000 copies in Holland already.

48:37.044 --> 48:40.004
[Chris] Yesterday we just hit
one million in the world.

48:40.178 --> 48:44.225
Three years ago,
girls wouldn't even sit
next to us at a bus stop.

48:44.399 --> 48:45.923
And now they surround us.

48:51.189 --> 48:54.496
[man] The highest new entry and
a brand-new number-one album:

48:54.670 --> 48:57.282
Coldplay andParachutes.

48:57.456 --> 49:00.328
I don't know how to introduce
this right, but hopefully this
time next year,

49:00.502 --> 49:02.504
you'll sing along with it
because it'll be a hit,

49:02.678 --> 49:03.941
and it's called "Yellow."

49:04.115 --> 49:06.769
["Yellow" continues]

49:08.336 --> 49:12.297
[audience singing along]

49:12.471 --> 49:14.212
[reporter]
Their debut albumParachutes

49:14.386 --> 49:16.736
has clocked up an incredible
three million worldwide.

49:16.910 --> 49:20.914
Not bad for four lads
with an average age of 22.

49:21.088 --> 49:22.829
["Yellow" continues]

50:18.972 --> 50:22.367
Merci tout le monde,
thank you so much.

50:24.934 --> 50:27.850
People always said, "You'll get
fed up with that song,"

50:28.025 --> 50:30.157
and I haven't yet.

50:30.331 --> 50:33.726
But I just--
I'm not sure if it's a classic.

50:35.249 --> 50:37.817
My name is Chris,
the singer of Coldplay.

50:37.991 --> 50:40.037
The multimillion platinum

50:40.211 --> 50:42.778
super-selling record
of all time

50:42.952 --> 50:44.389
was Parachutes.

50:44.563 --> 50:45.955
And we need to do a follow-up.

50:46.130 --> 50:47.435
And in order to do
this follow-up,

50:47.609 --> 50:49.089
we need to work extremely hard.

50:49.263 --> 50:50.873
This is the nerve center
of Coldplay

50:51.048 --> 50:52.310
where everything gets done.

50:52.484 --> 50:54.573
Let's go in and
see who's doing what.

50:59.621 --> 51:01.232
Will.

51:01.406 --> 51:03.538
You're the drummer of Coldplay.
What are you doing?

51:03.712 --> 51:05.932
I'm just doing some work
on the new album.

51:13.766 --> 51:16.682
That has to be his favorite
sound, an orchestra tuning up.

51:21.861 --> 51:25.125
What's the verdict in there?
It seems like no one really...

51:25.299 --> 51:27.388
-[producer] We think it's great.
-[Chris] Okay.

51:27.562 --> 51:29.651
-[Chris] I mean,
there's no room for mediocrity.
-[producer] No, absolutely not.

51:29.825 --> 51:31.784
-[Chris]
If it's shit, then tell me.
-[producer] It's fucking great.

51:31.958 --> 51:33.351
Keep going, man.

51:36.702 --> 51:39.574
But I'll say this even
if everyone hates it, you know,

51:39.748 --> 51:41.185
I wanted us to make a record

51:41.359 --> 51:43.404
that we could die happy
after we've made it,

51:43.578 --> 51:44.884
and that's what
I absolutely mean,

51:45.058 --> 51:47.234
and it sounds
incredibly pretentious,

51:47.408 --> 51:49.367
but there's no point
in being in a band

51:49.541 --> 51:52.239
unless you're trying to make
the best thing ever.

52:01.335 --> 52:03.598
The Phil-har-fucking-monic.

52:04.599 --> 52:06.253
The Phil Harvey-monic.

52:06.427 --> 52:08.255
-[woman in orchestra] What?
-[Chris] It sounds great.

52:08.429 --> 52:10.866
Just come in with attack,
as if you really love the band.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.130
-[all laughing]
-[Chris] Imagine.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.175
Here we go.

52:20.354 --> 52:22.922
I don't think we were satisfied
with the first album

52:23.096 --> 52:26.230
which made us work harder
for the second one, I think.

52:26.404 --> 52:29.015
There's no recipe
that we were trying to repeat.

52:31.060 --> 52:33.062
Oh, man, did you hear it?

52:33.237 --> 52:36.544
Did you hear Jonny's riff?
It's amazing. It's amazing.

52:36.718 --> 52:40.113
It's just Guy's bass playing
that lets the whole shop down.
You know?

52:41.593 --> 52:44.639
'Cause you spend all your time
videoing them, that's why.

52:45.640 --> 52:46.859
Guy, please, man.

52:48.121 --> 52:49.992
There was much more gusto
on this

52:50.167 --> 52:52.821
to just forget
your sort of personal, mental,

52:52.995 --> 52:54.780
or physical health.

52:54.954 --> 52:57.957
We just wouldn't stop until
what we were trying to do
was right.

52:58.131 --> 53:00.394
We could get someone else.
Pino Palladino.

53:02.266 --> 53:04.311
[interviewer]
Is there a downside?
I mean, you as--

53:04.485 --> 53:08.141
[Chris] Anyone who says
there's a downside to what we do
is talking utter shit.

53:08.315 --> 53:10.317
Of course we stress
and we worry about it

53:10.491 --> 53:12.450
and we put everything possible
into it

53:12.624 --> 53:15.192
at the expense of friendships
and everything.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.718
But there's no downside
to being in a band.

53:19.892 --> 53:22.982
[interviewer]
Is there a downside though
to being the face of the band?

53:23.504 --> 53:25.550
No.

53:25.724 --> 53:28.857
Chris has done nothing
but think about the album
for seven months,

53:29.031 --> 53:31.599
striving for
absolute perfection.

53:31.773 --> 53:33.210
He doesn't sleep really.

53:34.428 --> 53:36.430
He's been so incredibly focused,

53:36.604 --> 53:39.955
probably to the detriment
of a lot of other things
in his life,

53:40.129 --> 53:43.872
whereas I find it quite easy
to just walk away and go home.

53:44.046 --> 53:47.267
Especially when we're mixing
and you have to listen to
the same song 80 times in a day.

53:47.441 --> 53:50.052
By then, it all sounds
exactly the same.

53:53.926 --> 53:58.191
Well, Chris just went in
one weekend,
he was in the studio on his own,

53:58.365 --> 54:01.673
and then we all came back
on the Monday and he goes,
"I got this song."

54:01.847 --> 54:04.545
And we just recorded it
straight down as it was

54:04.719 --> 54:06.939
and we kept
that original take.

54:08.419 --> 54:10.290
This is new. "Scientist."

54:11.117 --> 54:14.816
["The Scientist" playing]

54:51.288 --> 54:53.246
It was just all there
straightaway,

54:53.420 --> 54:56.162
in such an immediate,
exciting moment.

54:56.336 --> 54:57.859
Best moment
of the entire record for me

54:58.033 --> 54:59.513
was when we'd come back
to this song

54:59.687 --> 55:02.386
and I just heard
through a wall this riff,

55:02.560 --> 55:05.302
and that's my favorite
bit of music on the record.

55:05.476 --> 55:08.957
["The Scientist" continues]

55:40.119 --> 55:41.860
Hello, boys.

55:42.034 --> 55:44.906
Before we went to America
we just thought, "Really?

55:45.080 --> 55:48.606
Are we sure?
No one's gonna like us there."
[laughs]

55:48.780 --> 55:50.390
There was no false modesty here.

55:50.564 --> 55:55.177
I had no fucking clue how to
promote a record in the States.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.658
I was lucky enough
to meet Dave Holmes,

55:57.832 --> 55:59.834
and he came on
as the US manager.

56:00.008 --> 56:03.621
Very quickly he was just
the overall mastermind.

56:03.795 --> 56:06.537
I was a fan of their music
from the first couple of EPs,

56:06.711 --> 56:11.193
but I'll never forget the day
I got a master copy
of A Rush of Blood.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.587
That's when I really
did believe,

56:13.761 --> 56:16.285
"Okay, these guys have the
ability to go to great heights."

56:22.466 --> 56:24.468
Dave very quickly
took the reins.

56:24.642 --> 56:27.166
Now he's just the big daddy.

56:27.340 --> 56:29.298
They were up for
whatever it took.

56:29.473 --> 56:30.735
Let's take America.

56:30.909 --> 56:34.391
But initially
the reaction wasn't great.

56:34.565 --> 56:37.132
Modern rock radio station
would put on a big festival,

56:37.306 --> 56:40.353
and we'd be sandwiched
in between some of these
really heavy bands,

56:40.527 --> 56:41.963
and it was pretty demoralizing.

56:42.137 --> 56:44.357
We'd have a lot of projectiles
thrown at us.

56:44.531 --> 56:46.968
Has anyone here
got our album?

56:47.142 --> 56:49.318
Right, flipping you.

56:49.493 --> 56:52.452
Nice job, great. One person.

56:52.626 --> 56:54.411
I remember we played
a radio show in DC

56:54.585 --> 56:58.545
and someone chucked a CD at
Chris and hit him in the head.

56:58.719 --> 57:01.418
And came back in the
dressing room and he went,
"Thanks a lot, Dave."

57:04.899 --> 57:08.207
I felt awful.
Here I was telling them
that this was a good idea,

57:08.381 --> 57:11.428
and I'm sure they were like,
"What the fuck
are we doing this for?"

57:16.084 --> 57:19.566
I think at the time we felt
completely different
to everybody else,

57:19.740 --> 57:24.353
but I think that actually worked
for us rather than against us.

57:24.528 --> 57:28.053
If somebody said a year ago we
were gonna do well in America,
we probably would've laughed,

57:28.227 --> 57:31.448
because it's not the kind
of music you'd associate
with the American music scene.

57:31.622 --> 57:34.538
They've never said no
to hard work

57:34.712 --> 57:37.018
and I'm sure there were times
that they hated my guts,

57:37.192 --> 57:40.935
and I'm sure there were times
when they were really wondering
if this was worth it.

57:41.109 --> 57:44.112
Is this actually gonna
result in anything?
But it did.

57:44.286 --> 57:47.420
Plowing across America,
it felt difficult at the time,

57:47.594 --> 57:52.207
but looking back on it now
they were, in many ways,
the most rewarding days,

57:52.381 --> 57:53.905
the days I look back
with most fondness.

57:54.079 --> 57:57.082
We were just kids, we didn't
know what was gonna happen,

57:57.256 --> 57:59.040
but we never gave up.

57:59.214 --> 58:02.217
["The Scientist" playing]

58:03.828 --> 58:06.221
So, American success,
does it matter to you guys?

58:06.395 --> 58:09.921
As long as everyone
that buys one of our records
is into it,

58:10.095 --> 58:13.838
we don't care
if it's 10 million people
or 30 million people,

58:14.012 --> 58:17.363
as long as
it's over five million people.

58:20.322 --> 58:22.455
I'm not gonna sit
and talk about any bad times

58:22.629 --> 58:24.283
because there wasn't
any bad times really,

58:24.457 --> 58:26.764
not in the grand scheme
of things.

58:26.938 --> 58:31.856
But it was weird, you know,
when it crossed over into
that mainstream media thing.

58:32.030 --> 58:33.771
We started our band together

58:33.945 --> 58:37.165
and there was a democracy
and this kind of concept
of equality,

58:37.339 --> 58:40.212
and then it was slightly strange
when the press focused on Chris

58:40.386 --> 58:42.736
and his relationship
with Gwyneth.

58:42.910 --> 58:47.306
I think for a brief moment
it felt like,
"Well, what about us?"

58:47.480 --> 58:52.224
But I think it's probably been
pretty awful for him at times.

58:52.398 --> 58:54.922
As amusing
as it might be at first,

58:55.096 --> 58:59.623
after a while,
it can feel pretty intrusive,
pretty claustrophobic.

58:59.797 --> 59:01.407
The thing that you've
dreamt of your whole life

59:01.581 --> 59:04.758
has turned out to not be
quite as happy and as innocent

59:04.932 --> 59:07.065
as it might have felt.

59:08.806 --> 59:12.549
I always wanted to be
in the NME.
That's all I really cared about.

59:12.723 --> 59:14.159
I think we all did.

59:14.333 --> 59:15.987
I never really wanted
any other recognition

59:16.161 --> 59:18.859
other than what we were doing
on a musical level.

59:19.033 --> 59:21.166
But tabloid attention,
as awful as it is,

59:21.340 --> 59:25.170
it's a sign that you're
sort of doing something right.

59:31.306 --> 59:34.048
When I get recognized,
I love it. I do.

59:35.484 --> 59:37.225
You know? That's why
we're at a cool level.

59:37.399 --> 59:39.924
Because the novelty
hasn't worn off

59:40.098 --> 59:41.665
and, you know...

59:43.449 --> 59:45.233
It's really exciting,
'cause the only people
that really recognize us

59:45.407 --> 59:47.192
are people who actually
like our record.

59:47.366 --> 59:49.107
I don't know how people
like Madonna or someone

59:49.281 --> 59:52.371
could handle that level
of fame because...

59:52.545 --> 59:54.982
you do have to just become
a recluse, I reckon.

1:00:06.690 --> 1:00:08.648
Okay, mate, you go first.

1:00:24.577 --> 1:00:27.580

1:00:40.158 --> 1:00:42.334

I'm sorry. I didn't--

[singing

1:01:34.734 --> 1:01:36.823
Music is just everywhere.

1:01:36.997 --> 1:01:38.695
The whole universe is music.

1:01:38.869 --> 1:01:42.263
You can just walk down the
street, it's a kind of music.

1:01:42.437 --> 1:01:45.745

in the day that's inspiring.

1:01:50.489 --> 1:01:52.273
When we first started recording,

1:01:52.447 --> 1:01:54.841
Chris had a little
four-track cassette machine

1:01:55.015 --> 1:01:57.235
and that's how
we put things down.

1:01:57.409 --> 1:02:00.760
It's before we had
mobile phones and laptops
and stuff to record on.

1:02:00.934 --> 1:02:03.197
[song playing, audio rewinding]

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:09.160
I'll show you my book.

1:02:11.292 --> 1:02:12.946
Huh? Huh?

1:02:14.252 --> 1:02:17.037
Look at that. See? Huh?

1:02:17.211 --> 1:02:21.172
If I should lose that, we'd be--
What would we do?

1:02:21.346 --> 1:02:23.870
-What's in the book?
-Get Travis to give us
some songs.

1:02:25.176 --> 1:02:26.568
Just girls' numbers.

1:02:26.743 --> 1:02:29.658
And designs
for stage costumes.

1:02:32.531 --> 1:02:36.013
My way of making sense
of the day is to sit down
and sing about it.

1:02:36.187 --> 1:02:38.537
I suppose
it's like writing a diary.

1:02:40.931 --> 1:02:42.933
No one really knows
where songs come from.

1:02:43.107 --> 1:02:44.891
You don't know how,
where, or why,

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:47.111
or whether any more will come.

1:02:51.245 --> 1:02:54.945
All of our biggest ones
take 10 minutes,

1:02:55.119 --> 1:02:59.732
but you only get them
by sitting for hours and hours
on the other ones,

1:02:59.906 --> 1:03:04.041
and then suddenly
one comes through
and you just receive it.

1:03:08.959 --> 1:03:10.438
You might take it
to Jonny, Will and Guy,

1:03:10.612 --> 1:03:13.267
and they add their bits
and it's like a production line.

1:03:15.139 --> 1:03:19.099
And sometimes they say, okay,
and sometimes they say, no way.

1:03:19.273 --> 1:03:22.015
It's the "okay-no way"
spectrum.

1:03:22.189 --> 1:03:24.278
When we hear a new song,

1:03:24.452 --> 1:03:27.412
Chris and I have a tendency
to be relentlessly positive.

1:03:27.586 --> 1:03:29.240
They're always like,

1:03:29.414 --> 1:03:31.372
"Yeah, I like it, yes.
I think it could be good. Yeah."

1:03:31.546 --> 1:03:34.723
And me and Guy
are sat, sort of fuming, saying,

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:38.379
"Boy, this is
a fucking waste of time.
Let's get on to the next one."

1:03:38.553 --> 1:03:42.470
It's difficult.
If Chris comes in with a song,
if I'm just not into it,

1:03:42.644 --> 1:03:45.560
that is the thing
that I just hate the most.

1:03:45.734 --> 1:03:48.825
You're putting yourself
in the firing line
for somebody to say,

1:03:48.999 --> 1:03:51.218
"Well, you go and write
a better one then."

1:03:51.392 --> 1:03:54.918
You've got the life or death
of the song in your hands,
'cause they're quite sensitive.

1:03:55.092 --> 1:03:58.704
But any kind of inkling
that it's not the best song
they've ever written,

1:03:58.878 --> 1:04:00.619
means it tends
to get chucked out.

1:04:00.793 --> 1:04:03.665
I'd say my hit ratio
within the group

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:06.233
is probably one in ten maybe.

1:04:06.407 --> 1:04:09.410
Any one of those fucking cunts
can veto it.

1:04:09.584 --> 1:04:11.760
It is heartbreaking,
but they're always right.

1:04:11.935 --> 1:04:13.675
I know that once we put a song
out in the world,

1:04:13.850 --> 1:04:15.677
we're gonna have lots of people
who say it's not very good,

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:17.549
so it's probably best that
the five of us at least agree.

1:04:17.723 --> 1:04:20.204

like his ability to make me

1:10:20.868 --> 1:10:22.783
If you look at
this Venn diagram
that I'm doing,

1:10:22.957 --> 1:10:26.744
it splits the set into
old Coldplay songs,

1:10:26.918 --> 1:10:28.572

What do you think about

Well, at the moment,
it's like a 60/40 split of new.

But if you minus the metric
we took from the first quarter
against merch sales,

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:43.587
it's the basic fractal
that we learnt from REM and U2,

1:10:43.761 --> 1:10:46.503
who we now refer to as RE2,

that you're that close with.

1:11:01.692 --> 1:11:04.390
Chris would be the first
to say that as well.

'cause I got really ill.
It was basically exhaustion.

1:11:18.883 --> 1:11:21.102

It was the day of
the Brit Awards.

We won Best Band and Best Album

1:11:28.458 --> 1:11:30.111

this feeling inside me

1:11:30.286 --> 1:11:32.592
that it should be
the best day of my life,

1:11:32.766 --> 1:11:36.204
but I just felt
so totally exhausted.

1:11:36.379 --> 1:11:38.729
It was not a happy memory
at all.

This is the weirdest thing
that's ever happened to us.

1:11:41.993 --> 1:11:45.779
And we're really made up.
So thank you very much.

1:11:45.953 --> 1:11:47.564
But then I came back

1:11:47.738 --> 1:11:49.392
and we made
A Rush of Blood to the Head.

1:11:49.566 --> 1:11:53.526
That was even more stressful
than the first one

1:11:53.700 --> 1:11:57.269
and my relationship with Chris
in particular was quite strained

1:11:57.443 --> 1:11:59.315
and something had to give.

1:12:07.975 --> 1:12:12.719
I think the dynamic
between singer and manager
is a specific one,

1:12:12.893 --> 1:12:15.635
and it just didn't really
suit our friendship.

1:12:15.809 --> 1:12:17.724
So I quit.

1:12:18.508 --> 1:12:20.248

something different.

from us as he possibly could

and then Australia. [laughs]

to tell us something.

He wasn't with us for one album,

1:12:34.219 --> 1:12:36.961

when we sorely missed him.

I don't think we were
very functional in that period.

1:12:50.409 --> 1:12:52.933
I think we lost our way
a bit, yes.

1:12:53.107 --> 1:12:55.066
I think we felt a lot
of pressure

1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:57.285
to make some kind
of grand album.

1:12:57.460 --> 1:12:59.636
There were strange headlines
in the press

1:12:59.810 --> 1:13:02.116
about the EMI share price
and all of that stuff.

1:13:02.290 --> 1:13:04.771
We didn't even know what
a share price was back then.

1:13:04.945 --> 1:13:08.862
We spent day after day after day
of getting nowhere.

1:13:09.036 --> 1:13:11.343
It came out in addictions
and it came out in tension,

1:13:11.517 --> 1:13:13.998

it was a real struggle.

precisely nothing finished.

And you don't film
any of the arguments.

to do, then?

the bigger you get as a band,

1:18:53.554 --> 1:18:55.556
We wet our beds.

1:18:57.254 --> 1:18:59.212
You can't please everybody,
right?

1:18:59.386 --> 1:19:01.998
If that's what you're chasing
you're just gonna fail,

1:19:02.172 --> 1:19:04.565
because it's just not possible.

1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:07.394
[singing]

1:19:09.614 --> 1:19:10.876
[Chris] Shucks.

1:19:21.234 --> 1:19:22.888
It's okay. I get it.

1:19:23.062 --> 1:19:25.848
I think it's important
to have figures of ridicule.

1:19:26.022 --> 1:19:27.675
I don't mind being one of them.

1:19:27.850 --> 1:19:29.634
The only time it's awkward
is if you bump into someone

1:19:29.808 --> 1:19:32.202
who's made a joke about you.

1:19:32.376 --> 1:19:35.335
In the old days,
I used to get really angry.
[laughs]

1:19:35.509 --> 1:19:37.729
But I changed
my whole philosophy.

1:19:37.903 --> 1:19:40.950
The only thing I complain about
in our job is that

1:19:41.124 --> 1:19:42.560
if you're the sort of person
who worries,

1:19:42.734 --> 1:19:45.432
you have so much time
to sit and worry

1:19:45.606 --> 1:19:47.173
that you just worry
and worry and worry.

1:19:47.347 --> 1:19:50.002
I spent quite a lot of years
being anxious

1:19:50.176 --> 1:19:51.961
about the people
that didn't like us

1:19:52.135 --> 1:19:55.181
without focusing enough
on the people that do.

1:19:55.355 --> 1:19:56.443
It's hard to explain.

1:20:00.404 --> 1:20:01.318
I'm not.

1:20:01.492 --> 1:20:02.928
You are.Apart from--

1:20:09.195 --> 1:20:11.023
No, Iknow, Guy.

1:20:11.197 --> 1:20:13.939
But if I wasn't a perfectionist,
we'd still be playing
the Falcon.

1:20:14.113 --> 1:20:16.115
So? But you'd be doing it
very well.

1:20:17.551 --> 1:20:19.771
I think everything
we've done is shit.

1:20:19.945 --> 1:20:22.339
That's why I keep
trying to do new stuff.

1:20:25.342 --> 1:20:29.476
That's my gut feeling.
That's what fires you up
to do the next thing.

1:20:29.650 --> 1:20:33.089
In the early days, I think there
used to be a lot more arguments,

1:20:33.263 --> 1:20:35.482
particularly between
Chris and myself.

1:20:35.656 --> 1:20:38.137
I was probably much
more opinionated back then,

1:20:38.311 --> 1:20:41.575
which I think was probably
a huge pain in the ass

1:20:41.749 --> 1:20:44.187
for everyone.

1:20:44.361 --> 1:20:47.146
I don't know if I was trying
to get away from myself or if I
wasn't comfortable with myself,

1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:50.715
but I definitely had
a drinking problem.

1:20:50.889 --> 1:20:55.372
It doesn't make for
the happiest of times.

1:20:55.546 --> 1:20:57.940
Chris definitely
wears his heart on his sleeve.

1:20:58.114 --> 1:21:03.119
Will, Jonny, and myself are
much more guarded emotionally,

1:21:03.293 --> 1:21:05.425
and that's probably
why so many bands have split up,

1:21:05.599 --> 1:21:10.604
because they haven't
learned how to accept
each other's differences.

1:21:10.778 --> 1:21:13.912
There was a time where
I was like, "Everyone needs
to just follow my feelings."

1:21:14.086 --> 1:21:16.349
At a certain point
I was like, "If this
carries on like this,

1:21:16.523 --> 1:21:18.612
then one of them's
gonna leave."

1:21:21.224 --> 1:21:25.489
It might be like,
"We don't wanna deal with this
temperamental idiot all day."

1:21:25.663 --> 1:21:27.230
♪ What a cunt♪

1:21:27.404 --> 1:21:30.668
Only 32 concerts to go

1:21:34.193 --> 1:21:35.978
They've got their own feelings
and their own lives.

1:21:36.152 --> 1:21:38.371
Even though
they are much harder to read,

1:21:38.545 --> 1:21:41.244
but they still have
highs and lows.

1:21:41.418 --> 1:21:43.463
Fucking mic stand
keeps hitting me in the face.

1:21:43.637 --> 1:21:45.552
It's like singing
into Naseem Hamed.

1:21:45.726 --> 1:21:48.599
I'm learning how to deal with
the peaks and the troughs
a bit better.

1:21:48.773 --> 1:21:50.993
Please sort it out.Understood.

1:21:51.167 --> 1:21:54.997
Every cliché that there is,
we've been through it.

1:21:55.171 --> 1:21:57.608
We just never felt like
it was important to talk about.

1:21:57.782 --> 1:22:00.698
Any group of five men
who have got to their late 30s

1:22:00.872 --> 1:22:03.962
probably gonna have been through
depression, addiction,

1:22:04.136 --> 1:22:05.572
divorce, everything,

1:22:05.746 --> 1:22:07.357
even if it was five accountants.

1:22:07.531 --> 1:22:09.620
We've been through
so much together.

1:22:09.794 --> 1:22:12.362
But what's incredible to me
is that we've stuck together
as a pack.

1:22:33.209 --> 1:22:35.515
Everywhere we go,
whatever we're going through,

1:22:35.689 --> 1:22:38.083
we can close the door
and sit down as a group

1:22:38.257 --> 1:22:41.695
and either laugh about it
or commiserate or celebrate.

1:22:50.182 --> 1:22:52.271
I could sit with
Jon, Will and Guy and Phil

1:22:52.445 --> 1:22:53.751
just for hours right now

1:22:53.925 --> 1:22:55.709
and just talk about anything.

1:23:12.204 --> 1:23:14.772
[all singing "Fix You"]

1:23:17.166 --> 1:23:21.039
I think that X&Yhad been
a bit of a slog for all of us,

1:23:21.213 --> 1:23:22.736
whereas getting back
in the studio

1:23:22.910 --> 1:23:24.825
and doing Viva
became exciting again.

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.654
[singing continues]

1:23:29.482 --> 1:23:32.050
We definitely missed Phil and we
realized how much we missed him

1:23:32.224 --> 1:23:34.574
when he came back into the fold.

1:23:34.748 --> 1:23:37.490
Yeah, Phil came back in
in glorious technicolor again,

1:23:37.664 --> 1:23:40.058
and that's when we bought
our own little place

1:23:40.232 --> 1:23:43.583
and really tried to
reconnect as friends.

1:23:43.757 --> 1:23:46.064
When I came back, I was
not coming back as a manager.

1:23:46.238 --> 1:23:48.588
Dave Holmes was doing that
much better than I ever could.

1:23:48.762 --> 1:23:50.851
I was coming back
as a bandmate,

1:23:51.026 --> 1:23:52.549
just doing all the fun stuff.

1:23:52.723 --> 1:23:55.030
We finally got our band home.

1:23:55.204 --> 1:23:58.294
That really brought
everything back into focus.

1:23:58.468 --> 1:24:01.297
You know, it was
our own studio, our own HQ.

1:24:04.256 --> 1:24:07.172
It was new territory for us.
We didn't really know
how to behave.

1:24:07.346 --> 1:24:09.827
I think we wanted a producer
to give us some ideas about

1:24:10.001 --> 1:24:13.004
how we can present
the next phase of our band.

1:24:13.178 --> 1:24:16.703
We wanted to find someone
who had the same effect on us

1:24:16.877 --> 1:24:21.056
as Brian Eno did on U2 and
David Bowie and Talking Heads,

1:24:21.230 --> 1:24:23.145
all these incredible bands
that we love.

1:24:23.319 --> 1:24:26.800
And so we asked Brian,
"Do you know anyone?"

1:24:26.974 --> 1:24:29.542
And he said, "Well, I wouldn't
mind having a go."

1:24:29.716 --> 1:24:31.544
So, we were looking for
the new Brian Eno

1:24:31.718 --> 1:24:34.547
and we found the old Brian Eno.

1:24:36.941 --> 1:24:38.638
I think he only becomes
interested in a band

1:24:38.812 --> 1:24:41.424
when they get massive
and terrible at the same time,

1:24:41.598 --> 1:24:45.210
because he sees an opportunity
to keep you massive,
but make you good.

1:24:46.646 --> 1:24:49.127
It's very much like a having
a lovely, cuddly headmaster

1:24:49.301 --> 1:24:52.391
quietly directing proceedings
without ever raising his voice.

1:24:52.565 --> 1:24:53.610
He's like a sort of
wizard-type figure,

1:24:53.784 --> 1:24:55.873
like a Gandalf or a Dumbledore

1:24:56.047 --> 1:24:58.615
who comes in and sprinkles
magic all over the place

1:24:58.789 --> 1:25:00.225
and then disappears for a bit,

1:25:00.399 --> 1:25:02.401
or says,
"I really like that song,

1:25:02.575 --> 1:25:04.490
but have you thought about
playing it backwards
and in French?"

1:25:12.281 --> 1:25:15.066
He's a relentless
experimenter.

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:18.025
He's not afraid for it
to sound silly.
He's not afraid to fail.

1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:22.073
It can be sublimely ridiculous,
some of the stuff
that we're doing.

1:25:26.469 --> 1:25:28.775
He kicked me out of the band
for a few weeks.

1:25:28.949 --> 1:25:31.038
At that time,
I could be quite strong-minded

1:25:31.213 --> 1:25:32.779
in terms of it has
to sound like this.

1:25:32.953 --> 1:25:35.608
So, he taught us to let everyone
get to the end of their idea

1:25:35.782 --> 1:25:37.871
before any judgment is passed.

1:25:38.045 --> 1:25:41.658
[all singing "Lost!"]

1:25:46.663 --> 1:25:49.535
We went to Barcelona and we did
a sort of singing trip with him,

1:25:49.709 --> 1:25:52.190
which is one of
the key elements on that record,

1:25:52.364 --> 1:25:54.497
the sound of lots of
voices together.

1:25:54.671 --> 1:25:56.629
[singing continues]

1:25:56.803 --> 1:26:00.851
The thing that
sparked Viva La Vida
was the big sing-along chants.

1:26:05.290 --> 1:26:08.467
The most purely joyous bit
for me is that communal thing.

1:26:08.641 --> 1:26:11.035
What's the next one?
Oh, "Viva La Vida"?

1:26:11.209 --> 1:26:12.906

1:26:19.478 --> 1:26:22.481
["Viva La Vida" playing]

1:27:09.136 --> 1:27:12.183
Through the course of
the next album, Mylo Xyloto,

1:27:12.357 --> 1:27:15.882
it was pretty clear
that I was doing well
in some parts of my life

1:27:16.056 --> 1:27:17.971
and really not well in others.

1:27:18.145 --> 1:27:20.278
When we're on tour,
it's such a little bubble

1:27:20.452 --> 1:27:22.454
that you become
institutionalized,

1:27:22.628 --> 1:27:24.239
and this is why
a lot of front men

1:27:24.413 --> 1:27:26.545
have problems
in their personal life.

1:27:26.719 --> 1:27:28.112
[sighs]

1:27:28.286 --> 1:27:29.853
Towards the end
of the Mylotour,

1:27:30.027 --> 1:27:33.160
it was a very difficult period
for about a year or so

1:27:33.335 --> 1:27:37.295
of feeling completely worthless
and nothing to anybody.

1:27:37.469 --> 1:27:39.079
I was just like,
I'm a mess, really,

1:27:39.254 --> 1:27:42.735
because I can't enjoy
the great things around me.

1:27:42.909 --> 1:27:46.870
Then, of course, I went through
a breakup with Gwyneth.

1:27:48.045 --> 1:27:49.655
Listen, man,
I'm never gonna moan.

1:27:49.829 --> 1:27:51.135
I'm grateful for everything.

1:27:51.309 --> 1:27:53.746
But it was pretty touch and go.

1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:56.967
It was evident that things
were very difficult for Chris

1:27:57.141 --> 1:27:59.317
and that he was unhappy.

1:27:59.491 --> 1:28:01.667
We sort of felt helpless
in a way, you know,

1:28:01.841 --> 1:28:07.282
naturally it's distressing
when your friend is going
through something so traumatic.

1:28:07.456 --> 1:28:09.414
He was in a lot of pain.

1:28:09.588 --> 1:28:12.765
Your mind can go to
the worst-case scenario.

1:28:12.939 --> 1:28:14.637
I was worried about him
to the extent that

1:28:14.811 --> 1:28:17.379
I was just really glad
to get a text in the morning

1:28:17.553 --> 1:28:19.816
just to know he was okay.

1:28:19.990 --> 1:28:22.949
And almost when he was
at his absolute lowest,

1:28:23.123 --> 1:28:25.561
that was when we
started making Ghost Stories.

1:28:27.345 --> 1:28:28.781
What we decided to do
on Ghost Stories

1:28:28.955 --> 1:28:31.262
was to really be honest
about it.

1:28:31.436 --> 1:28:32.829
I don't wanna bullshit,

1:28:33.003 --> 1:28:35.919
because I need to sing it
to get through the day.

1:28:37.747 --> 1:28:40.053
We all set up a studio
in Guy's house.

1:28:40.227 --> 1:28:42.708
I think that was all
that Chris was capable of.

1:28:42.882 --> 1:28:46.756
I remember it
as being a healing time for him.

1:28:46.930 --> 1:28:50.237
I think he started to smile
a bit more around then.

1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:09.996
He was having
a really hard time.

1:29:10.170 --> 1:29:13.260
Yeah, we definitely felt
very protective towards him.

1:29:13.435 --> 1:29:15.219
Chris's life
is different from mine.

1:29:15.393 --> 1:29:17.395
He has very much a public life.

1:29:17.569 --> 1:29:20.267
People know what's going on,
or like to think they know.

1:29:20.442 --> 1:29:24.620
So we were worried about him
letting people in too far,

1:29:24.794 --> 1:29:27.666
but this was what he wanted
to do.

1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:30.843
[singing "True Love"]

1:29:35.021 --> 1:29:37.023
I think Chris needed
to get it out of his system

1:29:37.197 --> 1:29:40.375
and he needed to express
those things in those songs.

1:29:40.549 --> 1:29:43.465
Of course, it was
a very personal album,
and I like it for that reason.

1:29:43.639 --> 1:29:46.772
I like it for its bravery
and its honesty.

1:29:46.946 --> 1:29:51.560
What we wanted to do
was to provide the comfort
that music has always given him.

1:29:51.734 --> 1:29:56.303
That's the only way
that we could really help him
was to be musical friends.

1:29:57.609 --> 1:29:59.524
When some of us have been going
through harder times,

1:29:59.698 --> 1:30:02.179
it's the band
that really picks each other up.

1:30:02.353 --> 1:30:05.704
That really is an amazing thing
to have in your life.

1:30:05.878 --> 1:30:10.361
Whenever anyone needs anything,
really, everybody's there.

1:30:10.535 --> 1:30:14.583
It has evolved into
much more than just friendship.

1:30:14.757 --> 1:30:17.107
We are more like a family now.

1:30:17.281 --> 1:30:19.370
It was a challenging period.

1:30:19.544 --> 1:30:23.679

from ultimate loneliness
to ultimate togetherness.

It's been a long journey
up to this point.

1:30:49.313 --> 1:30:52.447
The period that we've
been a band has been
such a shifting time in music.

1:30:52.621 --> 1:30:55.841
It's just not a time
where you can take something
for granted.

1:30:56.015 --> 1:30:58.670
I think we were very lucky
to have each other

1:30:58.844 --> 1:31:00.933
and lucky in many other ways
as well.

1:31:01.107 --> 1:31:03.936
I feel like I've been running
for years.

It's the first time
since I've joined the band

1:31:06.069 --> 1:31:08.767
I've actually stopped
and looked back.

1:31:08.941 --> 1:31:13.293
It really does feel like
a lifetime ago that we started.

1:31:13.468 --> 1:31:15.861
[audience cheering]Hello.

1:31:25.654 --> 1:31:29.614
What's still the same
is our passion to make
music together.

1:31:29.788 --> 1:31:32.530
I wouldn't wanna do what I do
if I wasn't with my friends.

1:31:32.704 --> 1:31:35.533
I think the gang mentality
is still definitely there,

1:31:35.707 --> 1:31:37.927
but it's just the gang's
got a bit bigger.

1:31:38.101 --> 1:31:42.409
That initial dream,
at the time we had it, that
seemed like the final point,

1:31:42.584 --> 1:31:45.456
and what I've realized is,
actually that's just
the beginning.

1:31:45.630 --> 1:31:47.806
I don't feel like we've got
to a final destination.

1:31:47.980 --> 1:31:50.635
["Paradise" playing]

1:32:17.575 --> 1:32:19.446
I don't want to stop playing.

1:32:19.621 --> 1:32:21.797
I don't wanna stop this.

1:32:21.971 --> 1:32:24.103
Don't want to stop this.

1:32:27.890 --> 1:32:29.413
Let's turn it up.
Let's turn it up.

1:32:29.587 --> 1:32:31.415
Let's turn it up.
Let's turn it up.

1:32:31.589 --> 1:32:33.722
Let's turn it up.
Let's turn it up.

1:32:45.864 --> 1:32:47.910
I really don't look back.
You know?

1:32:48.084 --> 1:32:49.738
I just feel weird about it.

1:32:49.912 --> 1:32:52.697
Like Phil said the other day,
because I was about to turn 40,

1:32:52.871 --> 1:32:56.788
you should write a letter
to your 17-year-old self
and tell him what you're up to,

1:32:56.962 --> 1:32:59.617
'cause his head would
just explode.

1:32:59.791 --> 1:33:03.055
The first few years, you try
to make yourself feel different
to everybody else.

1:33:03.229 --> 1:33:07.538
But in the last few years,
I feel like the journey's
just been to remind me and us

1:33:07.712 --> 1:33:11.716
that we're all in the same tribe
on the same little planet
in space,

1:33:11.890 --> 1:33:15.938
and more than ever, it feels
like that's what we're part of:

1:33:16.112 --> 1:33:17.461
one big band.

1:33:18.984 --> 1:33:21.726
[Mat]
So, what next?I don't know what's next.

1:33:21.900 --> 1:33:24.729
We've been trying to get
to this place for a long time.

1:33:24.903 --> 1:33:28.864
I'd be very surprised
if there was another
conventional Coldplay album.

1:33:29.038 --> 1:33:31.344
It feels like the finale
of the story,

1:33:31.518 --> 1:33:33.869
or the end of a movie.

1:33:34.043 --> 1:33:37.960
It doesn't surprise me that he's
saying now is the end of an era,
it's the end of something,

1:33:38.134 --> 1:33:40.484
'cause it really is in his mind.

1:33:40.658 --> 1:33:44.836
But I hope it's not really
the end of things.

1:33:45.010 --> 1:33:46.882
Literally happens every album.

1:33:47.056 --> 1:33:49.972
"This might be our last one."
And it hasn't been yet.

1:33:50.146 --> 1:33:53.062
I'm just looking forward to
what happens next.

1:33:53.236 --> 1:33:54.890
We've been together for 20 years

1:33:55.064 --> 1:33:57.849
and achieved so many things
that we wanted to achieve.

1:33:58.023 --> 1:34:00.809
I mean, it has just been
the most amazing ride so far.

1:34:00.983 --> 1:34:02.680
I'm grateful for
the whole journey.

1:34:02.854 --> 1:34:05.204
I have faith in the future.

1:34:05.378 --> 1:34:06.728
I trust life.

1:34:12.821 --> 1:34:15.867
First of all, thank you all
so much for being here.

1:34:16.041 --> 1:34:18.827
You're all actually
a part of the band.
Isn't that crazy?

1:34:19.001 --> 1:34:23.092
Even though some of you
might be ashamed to say it,
you're all members of Coldplay.

1:34:23.266 --> 1:34:25.311
We got one more song
if you wanna do it.

1:34:25.485 --> 1:34:26.791
Yay!

1:34:26.965 --> 1:34:28.488
Thank you for
that lovely response.

1:34:28.663 --> 1:34:30.708
You get top marks from me.

1:34:30.882 --> 1:34:33.885
One, two, three and...

1:34:34.059 --> 1:34:37.410
["Up & Up" playing]

1:34:47.203 --> 1:34:51.207
["Up & Up" continues playing]

1:36:10.590 --> 1:36:14.029
["Up & Up" continues playing]

1:36:22.994 --> 1:36:24.996
My friends...[audience cheering]

1:36:26.432 --> 1:36:29.218
this is the end of
A Head Full of Dreamstour.

1:36:30.088 --> 1:36:32.090
Back where it all began.

1:36:32.264 --> 1:36:35.485
Thank you, everybody
all around the world,

1:36:35.659 --> 1:36:37.313
at home and abroad,

1:36:38.923 --> 1:36:41.056
for being the best part
of our show

1:36:41.230 --> 1:36:44.755
and for keeping your
and our heads full of dreams.

1:36:46.452 --> 1:36:47.584
We're in this together.

1:36:49.194 --> 1:36:50.587
We're one big band.

1:36:52.284 --> 1:36:56.419
Everything is possible
if you never give up

1:36:57.289 --> 1:36:59.161
and if you believe in love.

1:37:00.684 --> 1:37:03.078
[singing]

1:37:25.883 --> 1:37:28.538
[cheering]

1:38:04.748 --> 1:38:08.665
[audience cheering, singing]

1:38:56.452 --> 1:39:00.499
[Chris singing "In My Place"]

1:39:49.331 --> 1:39:52.899
If you're watching this,
it means we haven't flopped.

1:39:53.074 --> 1:39:55.206
So, thanks a lot
for not making us flop.

1:39:55.380 --> 1:39:57.426
If you're not watching this,
we have flopped,

1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:00.559
so I can say what
the fuck I want.

1:40:00.733 --> 1:40:03.823
[singing off-key]

1:40:07.349 --> 1:40:09.916
[laughing]Come on.
We'll get past it.

1:40:10.091 --> 1:40:13.572
If you're watching this--Obviously,
they're watching this.

1:40:13.746 --> 1:40:16.836
It should be
"You're watching this."
Not if.

1:40:17.011 --> 1:40:18.360
Let's go.

1:40:18.534 --> 1:40:20.536
Let's go and sell
some fucking records.

1:40:20.710 --> 1:40:23.234
It's time to go home.Tell them
we formed at college.

1:40:23.408 --> 1:40:26.063
I don't care.
I don't like Alan McGee.

1:40:26.237 --> 1:40:28.674
Can you sing that note
again, please?Yeah.

1:40:28.848 --> 1:40:31.547
[high-pitched note]

1:40:31.721 --> 1:40:35.029
I think this song
is brilliant.I think it's good too.

1:40:35.203 --> 1:40:38.336
What do you think,
Will?

1:40:38.510 --> 1:40:40.208
I think the second half
is great.

1:40:40.382 --> 1:40:43.907
[high-pitched note continues]

1:40:44.081 --> 1:40:46.736
We are probably
the only band
in England

1:40:46.910 --> 1:40:49.434
where at least
two of the members
have got webbed feet.

1:40:49.608 --> 1:40:53.525
-Who's got webbed feet?
-We're all bluffing now,
aren't we?

1:40:53.699 --> 1:40:57.399
The reason I knew,
we were on tour.
We had a shower.

1:40:57.573 --> 1:41:02.534
And every morning,
there'd be two sets of normal
footprints and two flippers.

1:41:02.708 --> 1:41:04.014
[Guy] Two flippers?

1:41:04.884 --> 1:41:07.496
[all singing]

1:41:07.670 --> 1:41:10.020
I can fucking
see you laughing!

1:41:10.194 --> 1:41:12.196
A lot of people
think...

1:41:13.458 --> 1:41:15.678
we're not
rock and roll.

1:41:15.852 --> 1:41:19.986
But I ask you, is having
pastries before eight o'clock
not rock and roll?

1:41:20.161 --> 1:41:21.901
In what fucking universe?

1:41:30.606 --> 1:41:34.914
Ladies and gentlemen,
you may remember a year ago
this band was formed--

1:41:35.089 --> 1:41:38.222
[unintelligible]

1:41:38.396 --> 1:41:41.399
[shouting]

1:41:43.184 --> 1:41:44.707
Fucking pathetic!

1:41:44.881 --> 1:41:47.884
[piano playing,
Chris imitating dance beat]

1:41:51.279 --> 1:41:53.716
[singing in falsetto]

1:42:07.121 --> 1:42:09.993
[rapping]

1:42:20.177 --> 1:42:22.223
[imitating beat]

1:42:27.489 --> 1:42:29.055
I'm gonna be sick.

1:42:29.230 --> 1:42:33.234
["Life Is For Living" playing]
