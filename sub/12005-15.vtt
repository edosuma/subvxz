<i>She's known since 1998 that
the girls were switched?</i>

00:03.570 --> 00:05.505
I found out when Daphne was three.

00:05.539 --> 00:09.342
You kept my daughter from me for 13 years!

00:12.128 --> 00:13.962
I will never forgive you for that.

00:13.997 --> 00:15.197
And the more that I know you,

00:15.231 --> 00:19.101
the more I realize I was
right to keep it a secret.

00:19.135 --> 00:20.803
You would have taken
both girls away from me.

00:20.837 --> 00:22.938
You are damn right I would have.

00:26.676 --> 00:27.943
John!

00:34.684 --> 00:35.751

00:46.146 --> 00:47.396

Come here, you.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.513
Oh, sweaty!

01:05.483 --> 01:06.550
Yeah, and I beat my best time.

01:06.584 --> 01:07.551
How about that?

01:07.585 --> 01:09.319
Those rookies better watch their backs.

01:09.354 --> 01:10.587
- Yeah, they'd better.
- There you go.

01:10.622 --> 01:12.589
Toby, Bay! Time for breakfast.

01:12.624 --> 01:14.224
Breakfast.

<i>Kathryn: Oh now, don't run. Don't run.</i>

01:16.461 --> 01:19.179
Hey, curly. How are you this morning?

01:19.230 --> 01:21.231
Mmm!

01:21.249 --> 01:23.200
Ready for breakfast?

01:23.234 --> 01:25.035
All right. I hope everybody's hungry.

01:26.137 --> 01:27.404
Here you go, my little skunkerroo.

01:27.439 --> 01:29.239
Your purple one. And here you go,

01:31.209 --> 01:32.910
<i>- (Phone ringing)

01:32.944 --> 01:34.778

<i>Kathryn: The purple one is hers, honey.</i>

01:37.882 --> 01:39.049
- I want it.
- But, honey.

01:39.084 --> 01:40.851
I don't understand.

01:40.885 --> 01:42.586
<i>- I want it.
- You can have the purple one tomorrow.</i>

01:42.620 --> 01:43.787
- I want it!
- Quiet.

01:44.823 --> 01:45.889
What is it?

01:49.327 --> 01:51.295
Is something wrong?

<i>The other mother discovered the little
girl wasn't hers about six weeks ago.</i>

02:07.078 --> 02:09.713
She alerted the hospital,
they investigated to find out

02:09.747 --> 02:11.014
who the other baby might be, and... 

02:11.049 --> 02:12.616
It's our Bay.

02:13.618 --> 02:14.651
How'd she find out?

02:14.686 --> 02:16.820
The little girl got sick with meningitis.

02:16.855 --> 02:19.456
- She okay?
- She's healthy,

02:19.491 --> 02:21.258
but as a result of the infection,

02:21.292 --> 02:22.259
she went deaf.

02:22.293 --> 02:24.161
- (Sighs)
- Oh, God.

02:24.195 --> 02:27.264
What do we do?

02:27.298 --> 02:29.066
- We fix it.
- How?

02:29.100 --> 02:30.200
I don't know. But we will.

02:32.036 --> 02:33.937
<i>John: So what happens now?</i>

02:33.972 --> 02:35.305
<i>Kathryn: Do we meet the other parents?</i>

02:35.340 --> 02:37.074
I believe it's just the mother,

02:37.108 --> 02:38.275
Regina Vasquez.

02:38.309 --> 02:39.910
We're still trying to
find out about the father.

02:39.944 --> 02:41.712
What exactly do we know about this woman?

02:44.816 --> 02:46.783
She has two drunk driving arrests.

02:46.818 --> 02:47.526
What?

02:47.527 --> 02:49.630
Including one when Daphne
was in the car with her.

02:49.654 --> 02:50.787
Are you kidding me?!

02:50.822 --> 02:52.706
Oh my... this is unbelievable.

02:54.592 --> 02:55.559
How do we get our daughter back?

02:55.593 --> 02:57.327
We can't lose our Bay.

02:57.362 --> 02:58.495
We can't lose her.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.164
Of course not.

03:00.198 --> 03:02.099
Okay, you know what?

03:02.133 --> 03:04.101
We want custody of both girls.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.406
<i>Amanda: And on July 28, you were
arrested for driving while intoxicated.</i>

03:09.424 --> 03:11.308
Daphne needed stitches.

03:11.342 --> 03:13.010
She fell on the front steps,

03:13.044 --> 03:14.011
and I had to get her to the free clinic.

03:14.045 --> 03:15.179
<i>They closed at 7:00.</i>

03:15.213 --> 03:16.880
I had to get her there in time.

03:16.915 --> 03:18.949
Maybe if you'd been
supervising your daughter

03:18.983 --> 03:20.651
<i>instead of drinking, she
wouldn't have been injured.</i>

03:20.685 --> 03:22.653
- Objection.
- Overruled.

03:22.687 --> 03:25.522
I was a tenth of a point over the limit.

03:25.557 --> 03:27.457
Don't you think that
with a child in the car,

03:27.492 --> 03:29.326
any amount of alcohol is over the limit?

03:29.360 --> 03:31.461
- Of course. But... 
- How many times have you driven your daughter

03:31.496 --> 03:32.462
when you thought you were sober?

03:32.497 --> 03:33.630
It was an emergency.

03:33.665 --> 03:35.299
Your Honor, my client is... 

03:35.333 --> 03:36.466
Objection sustained.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.874
Do you know the current whereabouts

03:43.908 --> 03:45.075
of Bay's biological father?

03:45.109 --> 03:47.110
I believe he's somewhere in Italy.

03:47.145 --> 03:50.847
Angelo left when the DNA test
proved that Daphne wasn't his.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.649
He thought I had cheated on him.

03:52.684 --> 03:54.518
So you're raising Daphne by yourself?

03:54.552 --> 03:56.620
Yes.

03:56.654 --> 03:57.821
But my mother is in Puerto Rico,

03:57.855 --> 03:59.489
and I'm sure she's willing to move here.

03:59.524 --> 04:00.691
Aren't the two of you estranged?

04:03.294 --> 04:04.261
Well... 

04:04.295 --> 04:06.163
we haven't spoken in awhile, but... 

04:06.197 --> 04:08.265
And isn't that because
you resisted her attempts

04:08.299 --> 04:09.433
to help you get sober?

04:09.467 --> 04:10.500
Objection.

04:10.535 --> 04:12.936
No, that's... 

04:12.971 --> 04:14.371
that's all right.

04:14.405 --> 04:16.039
No further questions.

04:20.945 --> 04:22.913
<i>(Gavel bangs)</i>

04:24.716 --> 04:26.583
It is the opinion of this court

04:26.618 --> 04:28.685
that it would cause
undue harm to Bay Kennish

04:28.720 --> 04:31.622
if she were removed from
the only home she has known

04:31.656 --> 04:33.390
and then placed in an environment

04:33.424 --> 04:34.591
that is unstable at best.

04:34.626 --> 04:37.728
<i>Therefore, custody will
remain with the Kennishes.</i>

04:39.597 --> 04:42.266
<i>As to the matter of Daphne Vasquez,</i>

04:42.300 --> 04:45.202
the court recognizes that
Regina Vasquez has raised her

04:45.236 --> 04:47.104
for the past three years.

04:47.138 --> 04:49.306
But it cannot ignore her
substance abuse problem

04:49.340 --> 04:52.109
and disregard for the child's safety.

04:52.143 --> 04:55.012
I'm granting custody of
Daphne to the Kennishes.

04:55.046 --> 04:57.614
<i>Now I am willing to revisit the issues</i>

04:57.649 --> 05:00.684
<i>of custody and visitation of Bay and Daphne</i>

05:00.718 --> 05:03.487
<i>if and when Miss Vasquez can demonstrate</i>

05:03.521 --> 05:05.589
that she is clean and sober.

05:07.525 --> 05:09.693
Please, she's already lost
her hearing and her father.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.561
You can't take me away too.

05:11.596 --> 05:13.330
I am all she has.

05:13.364 --> 05:15.599
Please, don't do this to her.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.517
Kathryn, you're a mother.

05:17.552 --> 05:20.020
You understand, please.

05:20.071 --> 05:23.273
You wouldn't even know about
her if I hadn't said anything.

05:23.308 --> 05:25.208
Please.

05:25.243 --> 05:28.178
(Sobs) Please, don't!

05:36.988 --> 05:38.822
<i>The best thing you can do right now</i>

05:38.856 --> 05:40.957
<i>is get treatment and get sober.</i>

05:40.991 --> 05:44.461
It's the only way you're
gonna be part of her life.

05:44.495 --> 05:45.829
The other little girl too.

05:49.367 --> 05:51.301
She doesn't even
understand what's happening.

05:51.336 --> 05:53.303
She's confused.

05:53.338 --> 05:54.304
I mean, can't you see that?

05:55.473 --> 05:57.040
I'm sorry.

05:57.075 --> 05:59.009
I really do have to take her now.

06:02.413 --> 06:04.247
Okay.

06:04.265 --> 06:06.917
Can you look at me?

06:08.019 --> 06:10.754
I love you.

06:10.788 --> 06:13.156
I really do.

06:13.191 --> 06:16.059
I will always love you.

- What party?
- Mom, we have different friends.

08:46.521 --> 08:48.372
It could be really fun.

08:48.406 --> 08:49.824
Then you should go.

09:38.673 --> 09:40.508
always carry pepper spray on me,

09:40.542 --> 09:43.577
and don't take drinks I didn't
mix myself, they trust me.

Why?

10:16.745 --> 10:19.146
Just get a jumpstart on college.

10:19.180 --> 10:21.248
Start all that learning
a little bit faster.

10:21.283 --> 10:23.050
Challenge the old noggin.

10:23.084 --> 10:24.985
Bay, college will come soon enough.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.121
And I bet your parents aren't
gonna want you to fly the coop

10:27.155 --> 10:29.023
six months early.

10:29.057 --> 10:29.990
You sure about that?

10:30.025 --> 10:31.292
What do you mean?

10:31.326 --> 10:34.028
Look, everyone wants to pretend

10:34.062 --> 10:36.030
that we're this happy little family.

10:36.064 --> 10:38.599
Two bio kids, one adopted.

10:38.633 --> 10:39.667
Perfectly blended.

10:39.701 --> 10:41.502
But I'm not one of them.

10:41.536 --> 10:42.836
They know it.

10:42.871 --> 10:44.605
And I know it.

10:44.639 --> 10:47.441
Honey, I've spoken to your
parents numerous times.

10:47.475 --> 10:49.243
And I've never gotten the impression

10:49.277 --> 10:50.511
that they think of you any differently

10:50.545 --> 10:52.212
than Daphne or Toby.

10:52.247 --> 10:53.347
You can't erase history.

10:53.381 --> 10:55.382
I'm the charity case.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.051
The kid that they got stuck with

10:57.085 --> 10:58.919
because my bio mom is a train wreck.

11:00.088 --> 11:02.022
You and your family are in... 

11:02.057 --> 11:03.791
a very unusual situation.

11:03.825 --> 11:07.027
It may feel like they're trying
to vilify your birth mother.

11:07.062 --> 11:09.797
Oh, they're doing it. Trust me.

11:09.831 --> 11:11.732
And it's not just them.

11:11.766 --> 11:13.834
I hear my grandmother say
to my mother all the time

11:13.868 --> 11:15.569
"Remember, Kathryn, she's Puerto Rican.

11:15.604 --> 11:17.404
They're not great at school."

11:17.439 --> 11:20.774
Well, I think you've proven your
grandmother wrong about a hundred times over.

11:20.809 --> 11:23.377
I understand this is important to you,

11:23.411 --> 11:25.613
but I don't think it's
realistic to graduate early.

11:25.647 --> 11:29.049
I think you're gonna have to
sit tight for a while longer.

11:29.084 --> 11:30.184
Yeah.

11:30.218 --> 11:33.120
Uh, okay.

11:33.154 --> 11:34.922
Thank you.

11:40.912 --> 11:41.962
Daphne.

11:43.031 --> 11:45.099
John? Your daughter's here.

11:46.901 --> 11:49.637
I'd like to see what you spent $479 on.

11:50.639 --> 11:51.905
The credit card company called,

11:51.940 --> 11:54.408
warning us of possible fraudulent charges.

11:54.442 --> 11:55.542
- So... 
- At 11:00 A.M.,

11:55.560 --> 11:57.511
which I'm pretty sure
is during school hours.

11:57.545 --> 11:59.380
You guys, I'm so sorry.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.248
I was having a terrible day,

12:01.282 --> 12:02.549
and so Simone and I
decided to go off campus

12:02.584 --> 12:04.485
for just 10 minutes to get smoothies,

12:04.519 --> 12:06.420
and I saw they were having this sale,

12:06.454 --> 12:09.023
so I went in to see if
they had one of those purses

12:09.057 --> 12:09.990
that you wanted... 

12:10.025 --> 12:11.191
No no no no no no no.

12:11.226 --> 12:13.127
You need to know that
there are consequences.

12:13.161 --> 12:15.162
You can forget about going to that party.

12:15.196 --> 12:17.765
What?

12:17.799 --> 12:18.899
Guys... guys, come on.

12:18.933 --> 12:20.668
<i>I said I was sorry.</i>

12:20.702 --> 12:21.935
20 bucks says she gets out of it.

12:21.970 --> 12:23.804
Oh... no way.

12:23.822 --> 12:25.906
Skipping school and charging
up their credit card?

12:25.924 --> 12:27.841
Dad's the weak link. He can't say "no."

12:28.876 --> 12:30.444
He says it to me all the time.

12:30.478 --> 12:33.332
And if he missed out on the
first three years of your life,

12:33.333 --> 12:34.333
maybe he wouldn't.

12:33.748 --> 12:35.749
<i>- It wasn't my fault.
- This is serious, Daphne.</i>

12:35.830 --> 12:38.298
We need to be able to trust you.

12:38.332 --> 12:40.400
I know. I really screwed up.

12:40.434 --> 12:44.204
I am so so so sorry.

12:44.238 --> 12:45.238
We appreciate you coming clean.

12:46.340 --> 12:48.007
She didn't come clean. She got caught.

12:48.042 --> 12:51.878
I just wanted to look cute for the party.

12:51.912 --> 12:54.147
'Cause there's gonna
be so many people there,

12:54.181 --> 12:56.049
and it's hard for me.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.952
I mean, you guys know how
self-conscious I get in crowds.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.621
And trying to keep up
with everybody talking.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.890
She did not just play the cochlear card.

13:03.924 --> 13:06.659
Hey, if you've got an ace, use it.

13:06.694 --> 13:10.530
<i>John: Sweetie, there is no reason
for you to be self-conscious.</i>

13:10.564 --> 13:12.398
You are an amazing young woman.

13:14.368 --> 13:16.603
Okay, this is your one

13:16.637 --> 13:18.238
"get out of jail free" card.

13:18.272 --> 13:19.405
- (Squeals)
- John.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.541
<i>- What?
- She skipped school</i>

13:21.575 --> 13:24.043
to buy a $500 jacket.

13:24.078 --> 13:25.245
Yeah, and she can return the jacket.

13:26.247 --> 13:27.247
So I can go to the party?

13:27.281 --> 13:28.214
Yeah.

13:30.284 --> 13:31.851
(Sighs)

13:31.886 --> 13:33.119
You have to take Bay with you.

13:34.922 --> 13:35.922
(Scoffs)

13:35.956 --> 13:37.991
No way, mom. Come on.

13:38.058 --> 13:39.659
That's the deal.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.795
Plus it'd be nice to see
you include your sister.

13:43.497 --> 13:44.731
She will have a terrible time.

13:44.765 --> 13:47.467
Then it's up to you to
make sure that she doesn't.

13:47.501 --> 13:48.768
(Groans)

13:50.621 --> 13:52.238
(Exhales)

13:52.273 --> 13:53.206
Have fun.

13:57.779 --> 13:58.879

14:18.099 --> 14:21.168
Um, I seem to remember that returning that

14:21.202 --> 14:22.970
was a condition of your release.

14:23.004 --> 14:24.888
I will return it. Tomorrow.

14:24.939 --> 14:26.273
Simone has a tag gun she got off eBay.

14:26.307 --> 14:27.825
You have a closet full of jackets.

14:27.876 --> 14:28.992
What makes this one so special?

14:29.043 --> 14:30.144
I don't know. It cures cancer.

14:30.178 --> 14:31.979
Let's hit the keg.

14:32.013 --> 14:33.046
There you are.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.882
- Both: Hi!
- Hey.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.584
- Hey, Simone.
- Um... hi.

14:37.619 --> 14:38.886
<i>* I can't get enough, you're the blood... *</i>

14:38.920 --> 14:40.654
I'm her hostage.

14:40.688 --> 14:43.390
Okay, you're not gonna believe who's here.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.359
You've had a crush on him forever.

14:45.393 --> 14:47.294
He graduated two years ago.

14:47.328 --> 14:48.679
Plays a little sport with an orange ball.

14:48.730 --> 14:51.598
Graham Vendoris?! Oh, where where where?

14:51.633 --> 14:54.501
(Giggling)

14:54.536 --> 14:57.104
Ditched in under two minutes.

14:57.138 --> 14:59.473
New personal best.

14:59.507 --> 15:03.944

Hey, you want to do a beer bong?

15:15.190 --> 15:16.732
Uh, no, thank you.

15:16.766 --> 15:17.866
I have no need to get alcohol

15:17.901 --> 15:19.001
into my system that quickly.

15:19.035 --> 15:20.627
Come on.

15:20.662 --> 15:21.603
Not to be technical,

15:21.629 --> 15:24.506
but isn't that more of a beer funnel?

15:24.532 --> 15:26.508
With a tube.

15:27.835 --> 15:29.444
Beer bong?

15:30.647 --> 15:32.481
<i>* Yeah, that's right *</i>

15:42.242 --> 15:43.508
Graham?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.443
Oh, my God.

15:45.461 --> 15:48.063
Daphne Kennish. You
probably don't remember me.

15:48.097 --> 15:49.248
No no no. I do remember you.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.916
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.167
I just didn't see your, uh... 

15:52.218 --> 15:53.852
Your ear thing.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.788
Uh... when you were at Buckner,

15:56.823 --> 15:58.824
I went to every one of your games.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.659
Must be a pretty big basketball fan.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.760
Yeah, pretty much.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.629
What's it like playing college ball?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.864
I actually blew my knee out
the second game of the season.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.733
Oh, no, that's terrible.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.601
Yeah, I was pretty pissed.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.702
Had to sit out the rest of the season,

16:10.737 --> 16:12.437
but I took some pre-med classes

16:12.472 --> 16:13.622
and it turns out I'm
pretty good at the stuff.

16:13.673 --> 16:14.740
- Awesome.
- It's funny.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.441
One little thing happens, and... 

16:16.476 --> 16:18.410
knocks your life off into a
completely different direction.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.245
I mean, how cool is the butterfly effect?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.180
Butterflies are cool.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.498
No no, the butterfly effect.

16:23.533 --> 16:26.318
Oh, that Ashton Kutcher movie. Right.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.954
He was so funny in "dude, where's my car?"

16:28.988 --> 16:30.956
That's, like, the story of my life.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.990
Except for with my phone.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.759
I think I've lost like four of them.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.876
It's not like you can call it and be like,

16:34.911 --> 16:36.962
"hey, where are you?"

16:36.996 --> 16:39.665
Uh, Bay, you remember Graham.

16:39.699 --> 16:40.916
Yeah. Hi. I want to go home.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.801
No, we just got here.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.602
So far I have spoken to one guy

16:44.620 --> 16:46.505
who wants me to do a beer bong,

16:46.539 --> 16:47.706
and I've spoken to another guy

16:47.740 --> 16:49.474
who wants me to play beer pong.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.609
But my point being... 

16:50.643 --> 16:53.211
these guys are just
like the ones at Buckner.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.613
Only drunker. Please, I
want to get out of here.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.115
Okay, I am in the middle of... 

16:57.133 --> 16:58.383
Damn it.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.253
Thank you so much.

17:01.287 --> 17:04.021
I'm sorry... how is it my
fault that he ditched you?

17:04.057 --> 17:06.858
Why do you always have to
be the weird, downer girl?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.210
It's like you don't
want people to like you.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.929
Daphne, you are the most
miserable person that I know.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.998
You just hide it behind $400 sunglasses.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.666
Yeah, well, at least I don't
see a shrink two times a week.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.734
Maybe you should.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.837
You could figure out why you're so empty.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.709
(Motorcycle putters)

17:30.416 --> 17:31.383
- (Engine quiets)
- I have pepper spray,

17:31.417 --> 17:32.417
and I'm not afraid to use it.

17:36.456 --> 17:40.292
I shouldn't be walking here.

17:40.326 --> 17:44.129
Are you, um, uh... deaf?

17:53.619 --> 17:55.866

17:55.875 --> 17:57.642
(Laughs)

17:57.677 --> 17:58.910
Well, that's a relief.

18:03.566 --> 18:06.551
This place... bad.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.322
Ride home?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.491
No. Thank you.

18:16.295 --> 18:20.165
No, actually. I'm not.

18:20.199 --> 18:23.935
I've had a really crappy night.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.070
I don't fit in anywhere.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.038
Not at home, not at school,

18:27.073 --> 18:29.007
and now I'm rambling to some hot, deaf guy

18:29.041 --> 18:30.609
who's probably going to dismember me

18:30.643 --> 18:31.777
and throw me into a shallow grave.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.516
Not dismember me.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.618
And now we know you can read lips.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.225
What the hell?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.527
I live in Mission Hills.

19:01.023 --> 19:04.776
Uh, better safe than sorry, I guess.

19:52.854 --> 19:54.588
(Groans)

19:54.622 --> 19:56.556
Yes.

19:56.591 --> 19:58.659
But I'd much rather
stay here and ravish you

19:58.693 --> 20:00.560
like "The Falconer's Mmistress."

20:00.595 --> 20:01.828
(Laughs)

20:01.863 --> 20:03.530
Very funny.

20:03.564 --> 20:05.432
- (Moans)
- (Giggles)

20:05.466 --> 20:07.301
Speaking of... so... 

20:07.335 --> 20:09.603
the character of Manuel,

20:09.637 --> 20:12.239
is he based on me?

20:12.273 --> 20:13.373
Maybe.

20:13.408 --> 20:17.311
Oh... aren't you afraid
John might suspect something?

20:17.345 --> 20:19.146
No.

20:19.180 --> 20:22.015
He never gets around to reading 'em.

20:24.118 --> 20:26.053
Well, he doesn't know what he's missing.

20:45.807 --> 20:47.574
(Engine quiets)

20:54.515 --> 20:56.350
Well, thank you.

20:58.586 --> 21:00.153
Thank you.

21:03.491 --> 21:06.193
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I... I paint.

21:10.031 --> 21:12.099
Camera?

21:12.133 --> 21:14.101
Pictures? Oh... photography.

21:17.038 --> 21:19.906
Well, uh... 

21:19.941 --> 21:22.709
tomorrow you can come back here,

21:22.744 --> 21:25.846
and I could show you some of my paintings.

21:25.880 --> 21:29.649
And you could show me
some of your photography.

21:32.487 --> 21:33.653
I'm assuming that's a yes?

21:35.723 --> 21:38.158
Yes.

21:42.497 --> 21:44.030
(Starts engine)

21:48.236 --> 21:50.303
Yes!

22:33.314 --> 22:35.449

22:55.870 --> 22:58.572

<i>(Footsteps approach)</i>

23:02.810 --> 23:04.478
Hey.

23:04.512 --> 23:07.380
I covered for you... with mom and dad.

23:07.415 --> 23:09.282
You know, 'cause I was on the hook too.

23:09.317 --> 23:10.484
Thanks.

23:10.518 --> 23:11.518
Are you okay?

23:16.257 --> 23:17.290
I'm fine.

24:01.369 --> 24:03.303
(Quietly sobs)

24:20.662 --> 24:22.396
Hi.

24:26.794 --> 24:28.097
__

24:28.236 --> 24:29.536
Uh... 

24:29.570 --> 24:32.139
Bay, some guy's here to see you.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.723
__

24:37.045 --> 24:39.913
Oh, um, I'm... I'm not deaf.

24:43.918 --> 24:45.819
Hi! Come on in.

24:48.723 --> 24:50.007
<i>(Door closes)</i>

24:52.960 --> 24:54.594
Oh, uh... 

24:54.629 --> 24:56.596
My sister.

24:57.732 --> 25:00.701
Yeah, I... I stayed up
late learning a few signs.

25:04.472 --> 25:07.374
<i>We don't look alike.</i>

25:07.408 --> 25:11.311
Yeah, she's not really my sister.

25:11.346 --> 25:14.548
It's a long story.

25:14.582 --> 25:17.250
I keep drawing pictures

25:17.285 --> 25:21.988
of what I imagine my real mom to look like.

25:22.023 --> 25:23.190
Like, does she have my hair?

25:23.224 --> 25:25.125
Or my eyes?

25:25.159 --> 25:26.793
I pass people on the street,

25:26.828 --> 25:29.162
and I keep thinking,

25:29.197 --> 25:30.864
"that could be her."

25:33.034 --> 25:34.634
Oh! I remember this one.

25:34.669 --> 25:35.869
Ah... oh, find!

25:35.903 --> 25:37.904
Find. I've tried.

25:37.938 --> 25:41.708
(Sighs) But my parents
won't talk about her.

25:44.879 --> 25:47.748
List?

25:47.782 --> 25:48.815
Papers! Yeah.

25:48.850 --> 25:50.584
I figured there had to be
something from the trial,

25:50.618 --> 25:54.454
but it's not in any of my dad's files.

25:56.607 --> 25:59.393
Box... turning, turning a door.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.361
Like a tiny house.

26:01.396 --> 26:03.430
Like a lock... a safe, a safe!

26:03.448 --> 26:06.199
Ah! I'm getting good.

26:06.234 --> 26:08.135
We don't have a safe.

26:08.169 --> 26:10.237
Ah... 

26:10.271 --> 26:12.239
but there's one in the car wash.

26:26.020 --> 26:27.754
Uh, the combination?

26:27.789 --> 26:30.657
It's probably one of my
dad's old baseball stats.

26:30.691 --> 26:33.510
So... no.

26:33.561 --> 26:35.495
What the hell are you doing here?

26:35.530 --> 26:38.432
<i>What the hell are you doing here?</i>

26:38.466 --> 26:40.267
Just a little poker game.

26:40.301 --> 26:42.402
With the Sons of Anarchy?

26:44.205 --> 26:45.272
Who's he?

26:46.474 --> 26:48.008
A friend.

26:54.348 --> 26:56.883
He was asking who you are.

26:56.918 --> 26:59.119
Why doesn't he talk?

26:59.153 --> 27:01.788
- He's deaf.
- So you and your deaf buddy

27:01.767 --> 27:03.601
just decided to break into dad's office?

27:03.635 --> 27:05.770
I'm trying to find out more information

27:05.804 --> 27:07.538
about my birth mom.

27:07.572 --> 27:08.773
Well, that's not where he keeps that stuff.

27:08.807 --> 27:10.708
You know where he keeps that stuff?

27:12.411 --> 27:13.611
<i>Toby, unless you want dad to find out</i>

27:13.645 --> 27:15.413
about whatever's going on in there,

27:15.447 --> 27:17.314
you better tell me everything you know.

27:20.352 --> 27:22.253
Okay, a long time ago,

27:22.287 --> 27:24.155
I was looking for dad's
"Playboys" in the guest house.

27:24.189 --> 27:25.990
Nice.

27:26.024 --> 27:28.392
And I ran across... 

27:28.427 --> 27:30.194
a bunch of legal stuff

27:30.228 --> 27:32.062
about your birth mom.

27:32.097 --> 27:34.131
Why didn't you tell me?

27:34.166 --> 27:35.933
You know how it is.

27:35.967 --> 27:38.869
Everybody tries to forget
any of that every happened.

27:45.010 --> 27:46.710
<i>Bay, this is going to take forever.</i>

27:46.745 --> 27:48.479
(Sighs)

27:51.616 --> 27:53.484
Dad.

27:55.554 --> 27:56.754
Those are my parents.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.425
You... you... oh...

28:01.460 --> 28:03.360
your parents.

28:08.266 --> 28:11.001
Separate... separated... oh, they divorced.

28:10.986 --> 28:13.220
Your parents divorced.

28:13.255 --> 28:16.123
Chicken dance?

28:16.158 --> 28:18.225
Oh, accordion. Accordion.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.761
Okay, so, your parents divorced

28:20.796 --> 28:22.696
and the court papers

28:22.731 --> 28:24.031
were in an accordion.

28:26.067 --> 28:29.537
Okay, it's like sections... 

28:29.571 --> 28:30.955
oh, like... oh, an accordion folder.

28:31.006 --> 28:32.473
So that's what we're looking for.

28:32.507 --> 28:34.675
We're looking for an accordion folder.

28:34.709 --> 28:37.411
Uh... let's see.

28:37.429 --> 28:40.548
I don't know why we have so many boas.

28:47.656 --> 28:49.390
Oh! There it is.

28:49.424 --> 28:51.091
Okay.

28:51.126 --> 28:53.394
Uh... custody agreement.

28:55.464 --> 28:57.398
Restraining order?

29:04.139 --> 29:06.841
These are letters she sent to Daphne.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.724
And to me.

29:46.915 --> 29:49.016
She wanted me.

30:05.817 --> 30:07.635
What are you doing?

30:07.669 --> 30:10.671
Just giving some stuff away.

30:10.705 --> 30:13.440
What are those?

30:13.475 --> 30:15.442
Letters from Regina.

30:15.477 --> 30:16.544
Who?

30:16.578 --> 30:17.511
You know... 

30:17.546 --> 30:19.313
my other mom.

30:19.347 --> 30:22.283
Your other mom.

30:22.317 --> 30:24.184
You want to see them?

30:27.135 --> 30:29.670
She was my mom for, like, two seconds.

30:29.704 --> 30:31.005
And it was all a big mistake anyway.

30:32.974 --> 30:34.942
There are dozens of letters.

30:34.976 --> 30:36.544
Birthday cards,

30:36.578 --> 30:38.679
references to Christmas
gifts that she sent you.

30:38.713 --> 30:41.449
She thought of herself as your mom.

30:44.586 --> 30:46.320
Where did you get those?

30:46.354 --> 30:49.223
In the guest house. Hidden.

30:50.492 --> 30:53.127
I'm sure there's a reason
that they didn't show us.

30:53.161 --> 30:55.262
Whatever. All I know is

30:55.297 --> 30:57.164
they put a restraining order on her.

30:57.199 --> 30:59.266
Threatening that if she
ever contacted us directly,

30:59.301 --> 31:01.001
they'd have her arrested.

31:01.036 --> 31:02.169
Okay, what's the point of all this?

31:02.204 --> 31:03.237
What do you want me to say?

31:03.271 --> 31:05.806
All my life I've thought

31:05.841 --> 31:07.775
that she didn't care about me.

31:07.809 --> 31:09.643
That she wanted nothing to do with me.

31:09.678 --> 31:12.012
And that was all a lie.

31:12.047 --> 31:14.915
Well... that sucks for you.

31:14.950 --> 31:16.684
But she wasn't anything to me.

31:16.718 --> 31:19.720
Just some woman who took care of
somebody else's kid for a few years.

31:37.205 --> 31:39.840
Don't you even want to meet her?

31:46.578 --> 31:47.744
Hey.

31:47.763 --> 31:49.713
(Sighs)

31:51.700 --> 31:52.783
So what do you want for dinner?

31:52.818 --> 31:55.636
Pork or sole?

31:55.670 --> 31:56.720
<i>(Purse clatters)</i>

31:56.755 --> 31:58.773
Did you make the hotel reservations?

31:58.824 --> 32:01.425
What are you talking about?

32:01.460 --> 32:02.626
You know... 

32:02.661 --> 32:05.229
the ones Chip asked you to make?

32:08.567 --> 32:10.534
You really should be more careful

32:10.569 --> 32:13.070
about logging out of your email account.

32:13.104 --> 32:14.939
(Quietly sighs)

32:18.176 --> 32:19.977
You went through my account?

32:20.011 --> 32:23.747
I saw an email from Chip Coto,

32:23.782 --> 32:25.716
so I just assumed it was my account.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.918
That is, until I realized

32:27.953 --> 32:30.654
<i>that it wasn't me that he wanted to see</i>

32:30.689 --> 32:32.890
in the blue dress.

32:40.565 --> 32:42.399
How long?

32:42.434 --> 32:45.269
Seven months.

32:49.241 --> 32:51.175
Seven months.

32:52.410 --> 32:54.044
You look shocked.

32:54.079 --> 32:56.213
I'm not supposed to be shocked?

32:56.248 --> 32:59.850
You can't have thought that I was happy.

32:59.885 --> 33:01.051
That we were connecting.

33:01.086 --> 33:02.820
Oh, please.

33:02.854 --> 33:04.855
Are you going to tell me
now that he listens to you?

33:04.890 --> 33:07.124
He does.

33:07.158 --> 33:10.828
He doesn't steamroll me
every time we disagree.

33:10.862 --> 33:12.062
He values my opinion.

33:12.097 --> 33:13.797
Stop that right now!

33:13.832 --> 33:16.534
You cut that crap, Kathryn.

33:16.568 --> 33:18.802
I ask you your opinion all the time.

33:18.837 --> 33:21.372
Like with Daphne?

33:21.406 --> 33:24.275
When I wanted us to learn sign language?

33:24.309 --> 33:25.576
You shut that down right away.

33:25.610 --> 33:27.444
Are you going to go
back to that? Seriously?

33:27.479 --> 33:29.346
Putting her in a deaf bubble?

33:29.381 --> 33:31.181
What the hell good would that have done?

33:31.216 --> 33:33.350
I read a lot about it.

33:33.385 --> 33:35.386
I thought it was important.

33:35.420 --> 33:37.321
And you undercut me at every turn.

33:39.090 --> 33:41.191
And now... 

33:41.226 --> 33:42.960
look what's happened.

33:42.994 --> 33:44.828
Look what happened.

33:44.863 --> 33:46.163
I'll tell you exactly what happened.

33:46.197 --> 33:48.165
We got great girls.

33:48.199 --> 33:50.034
In case you haven't noticed,

33:50.068 --> 33:51.802
our daughters are a mess.

33:51.836 --> 33:54.872
And banging Chip Coto is going to fix that?

34:04.633 --> 34:07.451
- Is this it?
- I think so.

34:09.554 --> 34:11.522
Do you remember it?

34:13.625 --> 34:16.594
Bet no one does from when they were three.

34:16.628 --> 34:19.096
I do.

34:20.231 --> 34:21.998
I remember when you came to live with us.

34:22.033 --> 34:24.168
You do?

34:25.303 --> 34:27.338
Yeah, you were crying.

34:27.371 --> 34:29.106
All the time.

34:30.909 --> 34:32.242
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

34:32.277 --> 34:34.110
I don't know.

34:34.145 --> 34:36.179
I mean... 

34:36.214 --> 34:38.047
we never really talk.

34:40.851 --> 34:43.587
Look, you were ripped away from everything

34:43.621 --> 34:45.822
that you ever had known.

34:45.857 --> 34:49.426
And then stuck with these people

34:49.460 --> 34:50.527
you had never met before.

34:50.562 --> 34:52.630
I'd probably be crying too.

34:55.766 --> 34:58.302
Let's go see.

34:58.336 --> 35:00.504
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

35:03.308 --> 35:05.392
Hi.

35:05.443 --> 35:07.311
We're looking for Regina Vasquez.

35:07.345 --> 35:09.279
My name's Bay Kennish.

35:09.314 --> 35:11.065
This is Daphne. We're... 

35:11.099 --> 35:12.950
I know who you are.

35:18.256 --> 35:21.125
You're gorgeous.

35:21.159 --> 35:22.993
Thank you.

35:23.028 --> 35:25.129
This is my sister, Daphne.

35:34.789 --> 35:37.541
You don't remember.

35:38.710 --> 35:40.744
I haven't seen you since you were a baby.

35:40.779 --> 35:44.448
What a beautiful young
lady you grew up to be.

35:44.482 --> 35:45.683
Thanks.

35:47.686 --> 35:49.420
So you know Regina Vasquez?

35:49.454 --> 35:52.256
I am her mother.

35:52.290 --> 35:55.125
So you're... 

35:55.160 --> 35:58.095
Your grandma.

35:58.129 --> 36:01.331
You look so much like your mother.

36:01.366 --> 36:03.000
Really?

36:04.302 --> 36:08.072
I've never looked like
anyone in my family before.

36:09.074 --> 36:10.140
Is she here?

36:11.843 --> 36:13.577
Do you know where she is?

36:14.779 --> 36:16.647
(Sighs)

36:36.367 --> 36:38.368
She died on my birthday.

36:41.172 --> 36:43.340
Our birthday.

36:49.931 --> 36:51.865
Little late, don't you think?

36:51.900 --> 36:53.100
Where you been?

36:53.134 --> 36:54.868
We went to look for Regina Vasquez.

36:54.903 --> 36:57.037
Who told you about her?

36:57.072 --> 36:58.706
Did something happen?

36:58.740 --> 36:59.940
Did she try to contact you?

36:59.975 --> 37:01.942
What is going on?

37:01.977 --> 37:03.877
We found Regina Vasquez.

37:03.912 --> 37:05.713
Okay, tell me exactly what happened.

37:05.747 --> 37:06.847
What did she do?

37:06.881 --> 37:08.682
- She didn't do anything.
- John, calm down.

37:08.716 --> 37:10.451
I am perfectly calm.

37:10.405 --> 37:12.172
- Why did you hide her from us?
- Did she come to your school?

37:12.207 --> 37:13.474
- Did she come to this house?
- It's natural for them

37:13.508 --> 37:15.543
- to want to meet her.
- Then why didn't you let us?

37:18.513 --> 37:20.080
You were children.

37:20.115 --> 37:22.049
It was too much to handle.

37:22.083 --> 37:24.952
It was not a safe home.
That woman was an alcoholic.

37:24.986 --> 37:26.320
Maybe if you would have
let us get to know her,

37:26.354 --> 37:27.922
she would have gotten herself better.

37:27.956 --> 37:29.823
She had two D.U.I.s.

37:29.858 --> 37:32.126
I wasn't going to let her
take my kids on visits.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.828
You didn't give her a chance.

37:35.931 --> 37:37.097
Okay.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.099
Okay, I made a mistake.

37:39.117 --> 37:41.001
I'm sorry.

37:41.036 --> 37:43.003
We can have her over for dinner.

37:43.038 --> 37:45.806
Invite her.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.741
It's too late.

37:49.878 --> 37:51.679
What do you mean?

37:54.816 --> 37:57.351
She's dead.

37:57.385 --> 38:00.237
Oh, my God. What happened?

38:00.288 --> 38:01.488
We don't know.

38:01.523 --> 38:04.458
I... I had no idea.

38:04.492 --> 38:06.260
I'm... that's terrible.

38:06.294 --> 38:08.112
- I'm sorry.
- (Sighing)

38:08.163 --> 38:09.263
Girls... 

38:09.297 --> 38:10.497
I hope they both realize

38:10.532 --> 38:13.200
that I was just trying
to do the right thing.

38:13.234 --> 38:15.069
The right thing for them?

38:15.103 --> 38:16.337
Or the right thing for you?

38:16.371 --> 38:18.105
I love both of those girls

38:18.139 --> 38:19.206
more than anything in the world,

38:19.240 --> 38:20.341
and you know that.

38:22.110 --> 38:24.044
Now I can make this better.

38:24.079 --> 38:25.746
I can fix this.

38:25.780 --> 38:28.148
There's no fixing it this time.
