00:00.078 --> 00:02.952
Previously on AMC's
"Better Call Saul"...

00:02.977 --> 00:05.218
Free. I'll shoot the spot for free.

00:05.243 --> 00:06.310
For free?

00:06.335 --> 00:07.947
You're losing money.

00:07.949 --> 00:09.115
My brother is sick.

00:09.117 --> 00:11.150
He's making mistakes with his clients.

00:11.152 --> 00:12.785
You're not gonna do anything, are you?

00:12.787 --> 00:14.195
To new beginnings.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.789
I need to see Dr. Cruz
as soon as possible.

00:16.791 --> 00:18.828
The man killed for
helping the truck driver.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.444
You are trying to correct
something which cannot be corrected.

00:21.469 --> 00:23.297
Hector wants to use my dad's business.

00:23.322 --> 00:26.423
If you manage to pull this
off and switch those pills,

00:26.448 --> 00:27.733
switch them back.

00:27.735 --> 00:30.159
I'm gonna need one more thing from you.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:51.743 --> 00:53.743
Let there be light.

00:53.746 --> 00:56.180
And then there was light.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.182
Geez. Will you look at this...

01:06.459 --> 01:09.263
That's where your mom used to work.

01:09.288 --> 01:11.327
Right back there, doin' the books.

01:11.352 --> 01:13.062
Yeah. Whatever.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.935
Hey, remember when we
used to ditch fourth,

01:19.960 --> 01:21.405
come in the back door?

01:21.407 --> 01:23.734
Tell your folks it was a free period.

01:23.759 --> 01:25.646
O'Dell's Algebra Two.

01:25.671 --> 01:27.421
Mr. O'Dell.

01:27.446 --> 01:29.680
Man, that guy was a butthole.

01:29.682 --> 01:32.149
And your mom, you know, I
think she knew we were skipping,

01:32.151 --> 01:33.680
but she'd always stop what she was doing

01:33.704 --> 01:35.409
and gimme a pack of Little Debbie's.

01:35.434 --> 01:38.989
Ahh. Think all those Little
Debbie's put them out of business.

01:40.305 --> 01:42.280
Hey, how'd you get up
there when you were a kid?

01:42.282 --> 01:44.811
Couple of milk crates, you know?

01:47.888 --> 01:49.721
Ohh.

01:57.364 --> 01:58.930
All right.

02:01.935 --> 02:05.180
No. No. No. Nope.

02:05.205 --> 02:06.510
Ah.

02:08.232 --> 02:09.556
Boom.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.363
Indian Head penny.

02:11.388 --> 02:13.378
All right? That's
worth about three bucks.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.697
We polish it up, run the coin game...

02:15.722 --> 02:17.815
Nice. We get 150 bucks, easy.

02:17.817 --> 02:20.762
$150? We got a $110 for a
plain vanilla half dollar.

02:20.787 --> 02:22.787
This... this is actually rare.

02:22.789 --> 02:24.360
I mean, you can see it.

02:24.407 --> 02:26.891
- $300, easy.
- Oh, $300?

02:26.893 --> 02:29.069
Me likey. Yeah.

02:29.094 --> 02:32.633
Now you're gonna tell me what your
coin collection was doin' up there.

02:32.658 --> 02:34.157
Uh...

02:35.477 --> 02:37.571
It's a long story.

02:37.596 --> 02:41.606
Um... let's get outta here.

02:52.805 --> 02:56.254
- All right. Now. Let's hit it.
- No, there might be another one.

02:56.256 --> 02:57.622
All right.

02:57.624 --> 02:58.856
Then give.

02:58.858 --> 03:01.086
What's the deal with the coins?

03:05.031 --> 03:06.422
Well, uh...

03:07.830 --> 03:11.116
I was what? Uh, 12 or so?

03:11.141 --> 03:12.604
I was working the register.

03:12.606 --> 03:15.840
Guy comes in, buys a box of Ivory Flakes

03:15.842 --> 03:19.711
and a sixer of Old Style.

03:21.563 --> 03:24.872
He pays with a couple bucks and...

03:25.352 --> 03:26.618
this.

03:26.620 --> 03:29.053
The second I see it,
I know what it is...

03:29.055 --> 03:31.456
it's a George Washington silver.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.459
I tell my dad, "Pop,
this quarter is rare.

03:34.484 --> 03:37.458
It's worth four bucks."

03:37.872 --> 03:39.397
Barely get the words outta my mouth...

03:39.422 --> 03:42.544
he hightails it outta
here to give it back.

03:42.569 --> 03:43.927
He can't find the guy,

03:43.952 --> 03:46.070
so he tapes it to the
side of the register...

03:46.072 --> 03:47.648
he's hoping...

03:47.673 --> 03:49.695
that this guy will come back...

03:49.720 --> 03:52.076
so we can return it.

03:52.078 --> 03:54.078
After about a week,
he starts talking about

03:54.080 --> 03:56.314
givin' it to Father
Mahoney for the poor box,

03:56.316 --> 03:58.060
so I make it disappear.

03:58.085 --> 04:00.685
And after that, every day after
school, I'm checking the till.

04:00.710 --> 04:02.069
You know, something catches my eye,

04:02.093 --> 04:05.323
I stick it in the box, put
it up there for good luck.

04:06.693 --> 04:08.860
So much for good luck.

04:10.389 --> 04:13.427
It was a cryin' shame
they lost this place.

04:13.452 --> 04:16.255
They never shoulda bought
it in the first place.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.779
My dad didn't have it in him.

04:18.805 --> 04:20.137
Whaddya mean?

04:20.163 --> 04:22.240
Your folks worked so hard.

04:22.242 --> 04:23.468
Yeah, they worked hard!

04:23.493 --> 04:26.310
They worked a lotta
hours for a lotta years.

04:26.335 --> 04:27.638
For nothin'.

04:27.663 --> 04:30.864
I dunno, Jimmy. He had a lotta
customers. Everybody liked him.

04:30.866 --> 04:34.232
Everybody liked him
'cause he was a soft touch.

04:34.257 --> 04:37.237
You know? Every deadbeat in
the neighborhood owed him money.

04:37.239 --> 04:38.872
You come in here with a sob story,

04:38.874 --> 04:41.675
you leave with a pat on the
back and a gallon of milk.

04:41.677 --> 04:43.276
He... he coulda made it work.

04:43.278 --> 04:45.078
He coulda sold beer and cigarettes

04:45.080 --> 04:46.880
to the kids from Mary-Margaret's,

04:46.882 --> 04:50.382
but... oh, no, not him.

04:50.407 --> 04:53.717
He was never gonna do what he had to do.

05:03.998 --> 05:05.866
How'd you know there'd be another?

05:10.357 --> 05:11.757
Oh.

05:11.782 --> 05:13.749
Banquet's over.

05:14.576 --> 05:18.077
Those conventioneers been
talking farm equipment

05:18.102 --> 05:20.236
for 10 hours straight...

05:20.261 --> 05:22.349
now they wanna party.

05:23.919 --> 05:26.919
Gonna be a big night,
my friend. Whaddya say?

05:26.944 --> 05:29.336
- Time to get moving?
- Let's go.

05:53.243 --> 05:55.443
_

09:19.503 --> 09:21.736
Yeah. Tribal police?

09:21.738 --> 09:24.939
Yeah, I was out on your
property this afternoon

09:24.941 --> 09:27.252
and found a dead body.

09:27.744 --> 09:30.236
Off the old post road.

09:30.261 --> 09:35.338
Out in the scrub, just past
the Oasis Motel billboard.

09:35.385 --> 09:39.587
I was out with my metal
detector, looking for arrowheads.

09:40.757 --> 09:42.214
No, I don't want to give my name.

09:42.239 --> 09:44.225
I-I-I was trespassing.

09:44.227 --> 09:46.534
Look, y-you'd better
send someone out there

09:46.559 --> 09:49.360
to find him before the coyotes do.

10:07.835 --> 10:12.210
Over here, I've recorded
the location of the incident,

10:12.235 --> 10:15.905
that is where I was
physically when it began.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.774
This column gives a proximate origin...

10:18.776 --> 10:21.062
uh, and as you can see, uh,

10:21.087 --> 10:24.580
much of time, I couldn't be
sure, so I just wrote "ambient."

10:24.582 --> 10:26.921
Um, and, of course,
I've recorded the, uh,

10:26.946 --> 10:29.118
times and dosages of the medicine.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.210
This is very impressive, Charles.

10:31.235 --> 10:33.851
And look at the trend!

10:34.249 --> 10:38.131
Day one, pain of 7 and 8, even 8.5.

10:38.156 --> 10:41.007
Day three, nothing higher
than five and a quarter.

10:41.032 --> 10:44.010
And now... it's all 3s and 4s.

10:44.703 --> 10:47.492
Later in the session, I'd
like to give you some exercises

10:47.517 --> 10:49.484
and strategies that
might help even more.

10:49.509 --> 10:50.973
I'm all ears.

10:51.726 --> 10:54.357
How do you see your next steps?

10:54.382 --> 10:57.813
Well, clearly, with
this kind of improvement,

10:57.815 --> 11:01.050
it won't be long before
I'm back to work full time,

11:01.052 --> 11:02.842
with no accommodations.

11:02.867 --> 11:05.198
And then, soon after, I
want to get back into court.

11:05.223 --> 11:07.789
I haven't argued a case
in almost three years,

11:07.814 --> 11:09.759
so that's next.

11:10.171 --> 11:13.453
And I'm gonna get these
lights turned back on.

11:13.478 --> 11:16.399
I want this house to be full of music.

11:16.401 --> 11:18.437
I want to have a dinner party...

11:18.462 --> 11:20.226
oh, hell, no.

11:20.251 --> 11:21.717
A great, big celebration.

11:21.742 --> 11:23.475
I want a hundred people in here,

11:23.500 --> 11:25.257
spilling out onto the lawn...

11:25.281 --> 11:28.159
I want caterers and a full bar.

11:29.132 --> 11:32.520
I want to be surrounded
by friends and colleagues.

11:32.522 --> 11:34.740
That's stirring.

11:34.765 --> 11:36.190
Those are excellent goals.

11:36.192 --> 11:38.117
Doctor, I wouldn't have believed

11:38.142 --> 11:41.303
I could come so far so quickly.

11:41.328 --> 11:44.476
And I have to give you the
lion's share of the credit.

11:44.501 --> 11:46.732
Well, it's remarkable.

11:46.757 --> 11:49.201
But Rome wasn't built in a day.

11:49.226 --> 11:51.259
I know rushing forward may be tempting,

11:51.261 --> 11:53.351
but it's important
to give yourself time.

11:53.353 --> 11:54.986
- Mm.
- You've just begun a journey

11:55.011 --> 11:57.823
that could take years.

11:58.948 --> 12:01.775
Well, I suppose, but, um,

12:01.777 --> 12:04.095
surely you'd admit that
every case is different?

12:04.120 --> 12:06.595
- Of course.
- Then perhaps, uh,

12:06.620 --> 12:08.522
my recovery might be speedier

12:08.524 --> 12:09.790
than your run-of-the-mill patient.

12:09.792 --> 12:10.956
Isn't that possible?

12:10.981 --> 12:13.127
I'm just cautioning you not
to push yourself too hard.

12:13.129 --> 12:14.571
- Mm.
- I know.

12:14.596 --> 12:16.964
Appreciate every step forward,

12:16.966 --> 12:19.333
but modulate your expectations.

12:19.335 --> 12:21.534
Yes, absolutely.

12:23.384 --> 12:25.739
Let's talk about the
night you first called me.

12:25.741 --> 12:27.541
- Mm.
- You sounded very distressed.

12:27.543 --> 12:29.076
I was.

12:29.078 --> 12:31.212
Using a telephone must
have been difficult for you.

12:32.548 --> 12:34.748
I had to walk 10 blocks to a pay phone.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.370
That was extremely uncomfortable.

12:36.395 --> 12:38.152
P-Probably almost a 9.

12:39.598 --> 12:42.995
What made it so important
to talk to me that night?

12:45.361 --> 12:47.643
I'd had an incident.

12:47.668 --> 12:51.034
A very public incident.

12:51.591 --> 12:54.901
Perhaps the worst experience of my life.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.323
It was proven to me,

13:01.348 --> 13:04.378
in public, and beyond
the shadow of a doubt,

13:04.380 --> 13:06.690
that there was a battery...

13:06.715 --> 13:09.416
a fully charged battery...

13:09.418 --> 13:13.526
almost next to my skin for
the better part of two hours.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.706
And I felt nothing.

13:19.096 --> 13:21.432
What does that mean to you?

13:25.581 --> 13:28.385
This condition...

13:29.405 --> 13:31.884
to me, it's as real as that chair.

13:31.909 --> 13:33.407
It's as real as this house.

13:33.409 --> 13:35.659
It's as real as you.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.317
But...

13:38.389 --> 13:40.963
what if it's not?

13:42.010 --> 13:44.565
What if it's all in my head?

13:45.821 --> 13:48.393
And if that's true...

13:49.592 --> 13:51.706
if it's not real...

13:54.284 --> 13:56.997
then what have I done?

14:03.973 --> 14:05.739
It's all in the storyboards.

14:05.741 --> 14:07.241
Get set for the master shot.

14:07.266 --> 14:08.665
Okay.

14:09.642 --> 14:11.947
Lookin' good! We about ready?

14:11.972 --> 14:14.081
- Just about.
- I gotta hand it to you.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.317
I mean, this is the busiest weekday

14:16.319 --> 14:18.018
we've had in the last six months.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.960
And are people
mentioning the commercial?

14:19.985 --> 14:21.681
You know what? They are.

14:21.706 --> 14:23.400
- Excellent!
- I know.

14:23.425 --> 14:24.625
Oh, here's your partner.

14:24.627 --> 14:27.094
Hey, get him into make-up,
and we can carve this turkey.

14:27.096 --> 14:28.354
Okay. Listen.

14:28.379 --> 14:30.354
L... Ex-excuse me. Not now.

14:30.379 --> 14:32.199
- It's all right.
- Sorry.

14:32.201 --> 14:34.435
I just got off the
phone with the station.

14:34.437 --> 14:36.103
You don't even work for them.

14:36.105 --> 14:37.671
I never said I work for the station.

14:37.673 --> 14:39.106
I...

14:39.619 --> 14:41.492
Saul Goodman Productions, remember?

14:41.517 --> 14:43.172
You work with us so
you don't have to deal

14:43.197 --> 14:45.002
with the bureaucrats at KWBV.

14:45.027 --> 14:46.493
We take care of everything.

14:46.518 --> 14:49.016
Okay. Remind me, how much
is all this gonna cost?

14:49.018 --> 14:51.391
Exactly what we talked
about the other day.

14:51.416 --> 14:53.834
The first one was
gratis. That's my treat.

14:53.866 --> 14:55.833
Now we're moving on
to the Elite package...

14:55.858 --> 14:59.123
seven commercials for the
heavily discounted price

14:59.148 --> 15:01.295
- of $6,500.
- Mm. Yeah.

15:01.297 --> 15:03.963
The station just quoted me $450 per.

15:03.988 --> 15:06.857
- $450?
- That's for air time only.

15:06.882 --> 15:08.569
Call the station.

15:08.571 --> 15:10.237
Ask them how much they'd charge

15:10.239 --> 15:13.248
for production of seven
top-flight TV commercials.

15:13.273 --> 15:14.908
Okay, but why do we need

15:14.910 --> 15:16.710
seven new ones in the first place?

15:16.712 --> 15:19.813
Yeah. What... what's to stop
us from paying the station

15:19.815 --> 15:21.537
to just keep running the one we have?

15:21.562 --> 15:23.317
That's not what we agreed to.

15:23.319 --> 15:25.881
How about that for starters?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.323
He did give us the first one for free.

15:29.325 --> 15:31.106
Yeah, I know.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.360
Okay, how about this...

15:33.897 --> 15:37.715
how about we pay you $450 for
the one that already aired,

15:37.740 --> 15:39.756
and then we take it from there?

15:39.787 --> 15:41.769
Guys, I don't wanna get technical on ya,

15:41.771 --> 15:44.738
but that commercial... it
doesn't actually belong to you.

15:44.763 --> 15:47.650
Look, it's the real and
intellectual property

15:47.675 --> 15:49.043
of Saul Goodman Productions.

15:49.045 --> 15:50.744
I don't think so.

15:50.746 --> 15:52.183
I mean, it's our faces.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.748
- It's our store.
- And it's my commercial.

15:54.750 --> 15:57.003
And you can't run it
without my permission.

15:57.005 --> 15:59.207
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay. Want to play it like that?

15:59.232 --> 16:00.238
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay...

16:00.263 --> 16:01.900
$450 is now off the table.

16:01.925 --> 16:03.995
- Yeah, and that crew of yours?
- Yeah.

16:04.020 --> 16:06.495
Just a bunch of UNM students.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.082
- We can get those.
- We can get students.

16:08.106 --> 16:09.286
- We can get students.
- Yes, we can.

16:09.310 --> 16:11.120
- We can reshoot the ad...
- Yes.

16:11.145 --> 16:12.544
- ...and then run that
- How about that?

16:12.568 --> 16:13.662
Guys. Guys, come on.

16:13.663 --> 16:15.496
Now, you wouldn't even be
thinking about a commercial

16:15.520 --> 16:16.722
if it wasn't for me!

16:16.747 --> 16:19.035
Okay, we are not gonna pay you $6,500

16:19.060 --> 16:20.465
for something that we can do ourselves.

16:20.489 --> 16:22.488
- You got it?
- Seriously?

16:22.513 --> 16:23.847
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

16:23.872 --> 16:25.331
- Th...
- Excuse us.

16:26.914 --> 16:29.831
Hello, there. Anything
we can help you with?

16:46.136 --> 16:48.796
- What?
- Put that camera back up. Roll it.

16:48.798 --> 16:51.083
- It's not gonna do a damn thing.
- Don't give me any lip, okay?

16:51.107 --> 16:54.542
Just roll it. Make sure
it's pointed in my direction.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.496
- Now, if you're gigging a lot...
- Are you gigging a lot?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.152
Uh, guys. Sorry to interrupt.

17:03.177 --> 17:05.443
Just want to make sure...
there's no wiggle room here?

17:05.468 --> 17:07.314
- We are with customers right now.
- Yeah.

17:07.316 --> 17:09.666
Please, all right? Just go. Thank you.

17:09.692 --> 17:12.472
Okay, well, best of luck in
all your future endeavors.

17:12.497 --> 17:14.121
- Go. Goodbye.
- Go.

17:14.123 --> 17:15.955
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry about that.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.892
Oh!

17:19.916 --> 17:22.267
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.595
It was... a drumstick.

17:24.619 --> 17:26.705
It was laying loose in the aisle.

17:26.731 --> 17:30.004
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- No, you don't need to...

17:30.006 --> 17:32.152
I don't need...

17:32.177 --> 17:33.894
Aah!

17:33.919 --> 17:35.331
Yes, an ambulance.

17:35.356 --> 17:37.222
That's a good idea.

17:39.124 --> 17:42.183
You guys have liability
insurance, right?

17:43.338 --> 17:45.373
To our "Four Corners Strategy..."

17:45.398 --> 17:47.007
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

17:48.118 --> 17:49.278
Mmm.

17:49.303 --> 17:50.686
I'm not saying this to rush you,

17:50.711 --> 17:52.678
but I have a 2:45 tee
time at Four Hills...

17:52.703 --> 17:54.968
- so don't let me get, uh, long-winded.
- Okay.

17:54.993 --> 17:57.421
I've heard the water gets
tricky on the back nine there.

17:57.446 --> 17:59.552
You heard right. I
didn't know you played.

17:59.554 --> 18:00.920
Well, growing up where I did,

18:00.922 --> 18:02.663
there was pretty much
nothing else to do.

18:02.688 --> 18:04.924
We oughta be having this
meeting out on the fairway.

18:06.164 --> 18:08.330
Well, I think Kim has a lot to cover.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.514
Speaking of which...

18:09.539 --> 18:11.463
Sorry, but I-I gotta ask.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.898
I've got a friend, Billy Gatwood.

18:12.900 --> 18:16.402
He's a driller, has a small
operation over near Farwell.

18:16.404 --> 18:18.046
Anyway, the poor bastard's tangled up

18:18.071 --> 18:20.037
in some kind of an interstate wrangle

18:20.062 --> 18:21.462
between Texas and New Mexico.

18:21.487 --> 18:23.053
Now, I can't make heads or tails of it,

18:23.078 --> 18:24.444
and neither can he.

18:24.475 --> 18:26.114
His lawyer was a local guy,

18:26.139 --> 18:27.961
completely over his head.

18:27.994 --> 18:30.233
So Billy's fired the guy,
but now he doesn't know

18:30.258 --> 18:32.286
whether to shit or wind his watch...

18:32.311 --> 18:33.419
pardon my French.

18:33.421 --> 18:34.655
Right this way.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.038
Anyhow, I told him about
the job you're doing for us,

18:37.063 --> 18:38.694
and I know he'd love to talk to you.

18:38.719 --> 18:39.929
...Montana, I'd suggest Big Sky.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.320
It's got all the beauty of Montana,

18:41.344 --> 18:43.178
but you don't have to wait
as long in the lift lines.

18:43.202 --> 18:44.444
- Another...
- Oh, wow.

18:44.469 --> 18:46.499
I can't tell you how flattering that is.

18:46.524 --> 18:48.108
Remember, Kim's got her hands full

18:48.133 --> 18:50.444
with Utah and Colorado.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.093
As far as I'm concerned, she's proven

18:53.118 --> 18:55.452
she can field whatever we
throw at her and then some.

18:56.524 --> 18:59.327
Kevin, your faith in me is... it's...

18:59.647 --> 19:01.237
it means a lot.

19:01.262 --> 19:02.836
But when we first
started working together,

19:02.860 --> 19:05.224
I promised you Mesa Verde
would be my sole focus.

19:05.249 --> 19:06.366
And I meant it.

19:06.391 --> 19:08.224
- Well, sure, but I gotta take...
- Hey there!

19:08.249 --> 19:10.038
I thought I saw some familiar faces.

19:10.063 --> 19:11.757
- Howard.
- Kim... sit.

19:11.782 --> 19:13.402
I insist.

19:13.427 --> 19:14.968
- Kevin...
- Howard.

19:14.993 --> 19:17.162
...Paige... always
wonderful to see you.

19:17.164 --> 19:18.710
You, too, Howard. How've you been?

19:18.735 --> 19:20.366
Fantastic. Thank you.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.134
All's well with the expansion?

19:22.136 --> 19:23.749
I saw you got that branch approved

19:23.774 --> 19:25.397
on your original timeline, after all.

19:25.422 --> 19:27.614
We did. Thanks to Ms. Wexler here.

19:27.639 --> 19:29.796
Well, Kim's one of the best.
You're lucky to have her.

19:29.821 --> 19:31.627
She sure is, and we sure are.

19:31.652 --> 19:34.585
Seems like just yesterday she
was logging hours in doc review.

19:35.836 --> 19:37.689
Always a pleasure to see
one of our protégées

19:37.714 --> 19:40.194
spread her wings and leave the nest.

19:41.188 --> 19:43.020
Well, I'll get out of your hair.

19:43.045 --> 19:44.903
Best of luck to all of you.

19:44.928 --> 19:46.645
You, too, Howard.

19:48.872 --> 19:50.817
I appreciate that we've
got you all to ourselves,

19:50.842 --> 19:52.248
but I'm thinking Billy
just needs a consultation...

19:52.272 --> 19:54.802
I'm so sorry, um, but, uh,

19:54.827 --> 19:56.843
would you excuse me for just a moment?

19:56.868 --> 19:58.333
Sure.

20:20.170 --> 20:22.094
I've had the salmon here and the filet.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.687
if you like sea scallops,
they're fantastic.

20:23.711 --> 20:25.764
Kim. Uh, uh, hello again. Howard... sit.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.240
I insist. Sorry to interrupt.

20:27.265 --> 20:29.975
I just needed to give Howard something.

20:32.112 --> 20:34.483
Folks, this is Kim Wexler,

20:34.508 --> 20:36.075
a former member of our firm.

20:36.077 --> 20:38.615
Kim, uh, this is the team
from O'Malley Industries.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.245
Oh, of course. I remember Lauren.

20:40.247 --> 20:41.288
Good to see you again, Kim.

20:41.312 --> 20:42.833
This is Jack Sweet, our new CFO.

20:42.858 --> 20:44.124
- Oh, hello.
- Pleasure.

20:44.126 --> 20:45.792
Nice to see you, too, Henry, Nick.

20:45.794 --> 20:48.893
- Marie Austin. Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

20:48.918 --> 20:50.918
Good to see all of you.

20:50.943 --> 20:53.272
- Have a wonderful lunch, Howard.
- Mm.

20:57.053 --> 20:58.671
Sorry to hold things up.

20:58.673 --> 21:00.442
- Not at all.
- Okay.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.475
Kevin, if you want to give
me Mr. Gatwood's number,

21:02.477 --> 21:03.977
I'd be happy to speak to him.

21:03.979 --> 21:05.311
Well, that's great.

21:05.313 --> 21:06.846
Once I understand what's going on,

21:06.848 --> 21:08.314
I'll put him together with a firm

21:08.316 --> 21:09.883
that'll take very good care of him.

21:09.885 --> 21:11.684
I leave it in your capable hands.

21:11.686 --> 21:13.879
Great. Okay, Utah.

21:13.904 --> 21:17.090
The good news is the filing
requirements are very similar

21:17.092 --> 21:19.259
- to what we submitted for Arizona.
- Oh, good.

21:19.261 --> 21:21.786
Thanks again, Kim. I'll let
Billy know you'll be calling,

21:21.811 --> 21:23.499
- and we'll talk tee times soon.
- Sounds good.

21:23.523 --> 21:25.498
- All right. Bye.
- See you soon, Kim.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.865
Thank you.

21:34.785 --> 21:36.251
What the hell is this?

21:36.276 --> 21:39.101
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

21:40.492 --> 21:42.916
Look, Howard, you were very
generous when I left HHM,

21:42.918 --> 21:44.284
but it never sat right with me

21:44.286 --> 21:45.552
that you covered my law-school loans.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.452
It seemed to sit right at the time.

21:47.477 --> 21:49.076
I appreciate the gift,

21:49.101 --> 21:50.468
but now that I'm able to afford it,

21:50.492 --> 21:52.415
- I want to pay you back.
- Oh, you "appreciate the gift"?

21:52.439 --> 21:54.967
- Yes, I do, Howard.
- You know what I'm doing in there?

21:54.992 --> 21:56.750
Take a guess.

21:56.775 --> 21:58.464
I'm doing damage control.

21:58.466 --> 21:59.656
And I'm doing it three meals a day

21:59.680 --> 22:02.342
for the past two weeks with
every one of our clients.

22:02.367 --> 22:05.124
I'm busting my ass, trying to
repair the reputation of the firm

22:05.149 --> 22:07.540
after you and Jimmy
dragged it through the mud.

22:07.542 --> 22:09.576
I did everything in my
power to defend my client.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.144
Oh, is that what you're calling it?

22:11.169 --> 22:12.858
That's the job, Howard.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.481
And by the way, it was
all very convenient for you

22:15.483 --> 22:17.919
to ignore Chuck's illness
when it suited you.

22:17.944 --> 22:19.577
So, I take you out of the mail room,

22:19.602 --> 22:21.093
put you through law school, mentor you,

22:21.117 --> 22:23.056
and then when you leave and stab
me in the back, that's my fault?

22:23.058 --> 22:25.007
I'm not cashing this.

22:27.475 --> 22:30.396
Kim, your debt is forgiven.

22:30.398 --> 22:33.061
But anything else? That's on you.

22:33.435 --> 22:36.069
All Jimmy and I did was show
the situation for what it is.

22:36.071 --> 22:38.171
And if you are hiding
that from your clients?

22:38.173 --> 22:40.061
Well, Howard, that's on you.

25:15.023 --> 25:16.952
- Nacho.
- Hey, Papa.

25:16.977 --> 25:18.843
_

25:18.868 --> 25:23.257
_

25:23.282 --> 25:26.484
_

25:27.484 --> 25:29.578
_

25:30.117 --> 25:33.461
_

25:33.906 --> 25:35.562
_

25:42.633 --> 25:44.070
Blue shirt.

25:44.078 --> 25:45.874
Yellow wall.

25:45.899 --> 25:48.113
Silver door.

25:57.125 --> 25:58.835
White sign.

25:58.860 --> 26:00.827
Red pepper.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.687
Purple sweater.

26:04.039 --> 26:05.762
Brown wood.

26:05.787 --> 26:07.353
Black mat.

26:20.836 --> 26:22.469
Jason, can I get you to the front

26:22.471 --> 26:24.171
for carryout assistance?

26:24.173 --> 26:27.307
Jason to the front for
carryout assistance.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.646
Yellow bananas.

26:38.671 --> 26:40.287
Green grapes.

26:40.289 --> 26:43.090
Orange... oranges.

26:47.491 --> 26:49.068
Oh, excuse me.

26:49.093 --> 26:52.099
Um, where would I find the s-soy milk?

26:52.124 --> 26:55.281
Uh, over there and to the left,
just past the freezer aisle.

27:04.796 --> 27:06.968
_

27:14.523 --> 27:16.656
The white ceiling.

27:16.658 --> 27:18.325
Green basket.

27:18.327 --> 27:20.341
Gray floor.

27:46.015 --> 27:48.155
- All set?
- Yeah.

27:48.888 --> 27:50.205
Courier on the way?

27:50.230 --> 27:52.030
- 20 minutes.
- Great.

27:52.055 --> 27:55.091
They'll need this back
at Gatwood Oil by EOD.

27:57.508 --> 27:59.169
What's...?

28:07.599 --> 28:09.037
Hey.

28:09.039 --> 28:10.544
Hey.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.779
What's up?

28:17.781 --> 28:20.548
Oh. Uh, new guitar.

28:20.550 --> 28:22.316
Check it out.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.088
Mm. That is something.

28:27.090 --> 28:29.257
I sold the rest of my ads.

28:29.259 --> 28:31.474
- That must be a relief.
- Uh-huh.

28:31.499 --> 28:33.232
They loved the response they got.

28:33.257 --> 28:35.424
Were so impressed,
they threw in this baby.

28:35.449 --> 28:38.294
Signed by the one and
only Ritchie Blackmore.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.826
And, uh, lying on the floor

28:41.851 --> 28:44.122
helps you with your fingering?

28:44.147 --> 28:46.193
- Oh, I fell.
- What?

28:46.218 --> 28:48.199
It was during productions.

28:48.224 --> 28:49.786
Crazy stuff happens.

28:49.788 --> 28:51.221
A long story.

28:51.223 --> 28:54.591
But the big picture...
I'm up one guitar.

28:54.593 --> 28:56.380
When did this happen?

28:56.405 --> 28:57.494
Yesterday.

28:57.496 --> 28:59.229
I saw you yesterday. You were fine.

28:59.231 --> 29:01.231
Uh, that was Tuesday.

29:01.233 --> 29:04.294
You picked up clean clothes. 'Member?

29:05.270 --> 29:07.567
Did you go to the doctor?

29:08.622 --> 29:11.920
Oh, it's... it's not as bad as it looks.

29:11.922 --> 29:14.587
I just need to rest it. It'll be fine.

29:14.612 --> 29:16.278
Look on the desk.

29:16.303 --> 29:18.156
There's something for you.

29:20.018 --> 29:21.750
Yeah, that.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.609
Open it.

29:25.657 --> 29:27.430
That's my half.

29:27.455 --> 29:29.488
It's good for the next six weeks.

29:30.712 --> 29:33.296
So at least we can
stop talking about that.

29:33.298 --> 29:34.476
Jimmy, I wasn't...

29:34.501 --> 29:36.922
Just take it so we're square, all right?

29:38.437 --> 29:40.270
Okay.

29:41.201 --> 29:42.733
Sorry.

29:42.758 --> 29:47.043
Just... my back hurts
like hell, and, uh...

29:47.045 --> 29:49.879
people suck.

29:54.774 --> 29:56.469
Jimmy, you...

29:57.888 --> 30:00.742
you don't have to push
yourself like this.

30:03.829 --> 30:06.296
You could rest.

30:06.298 --> 30:08.003
Let your back heal.

30:08.028 --> 30:10.500
And then you go to community
service and get it over with.

30:10.502 --> 30:12.068
Take some time.

30:12.070 --> 30:14.037
Plan your next move.

30:14.039 --> 30:15.500
Meaning...?

30:15.525 --> 30:17.299
I'm saying...

30:17.324 --> 30:19.542
I could cover our expenses for a while.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.355
- Kim, you got the cash in your hand.
- Yeah, I know, but...

30:21.379 --> 30:22.922
- So why are we talking about this?
- All I'm saying is...

30:22.946 --> 30:24.981
I looked at the numbers,
and I can carry us.

30:24.983 --> 30:28.351
Not forever, but at least
until you're back to 100%.

30:28.353 --> 30:30.939
I appreciate the thought, but no.

30:30.964 --> 30:33.338
I'll do what I have to do
to take care of my half.

30:33.363 --> 30:35.492
You do what you have to
do to take care of yours.

30:35.494 --> 30:37.145
End of story.

30:40.836 --> 30:42.320
Okay.

30:46.978 --> 30:49.735
I mean, you believe me, right?

30:51.145 --> 30:52.755
Yes.

30:57.266 --> 30:59.255
Feel better, Jimmy.

31:18.066 --> 31:20.537
Francesca, is it too late
to get ahold of the courier?

31:20.539 --> 31:22.564
I can call. Need to reschedule?

31:22.589 --> 31:24.140
No, cancel it.

31:24.142 --> 31:26.376
And get Billy Gatwood
on the phone for me.

31:26.378 --> 31:28.199
- Will do.
- Thanks.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.553
I've got Billy Gatwood on the line.

31:37.523 --> 31:39.644
Great. Put him through.

31:43.228 --> 31:45.428
Mr. Gatwood? Hi. Kim Wexler.

31:45.453 --> 31:47.564
Listen, I've been
reviewing your documents,

31:47.566 --> 31:50.850
and I thought I might've had to
refer you to a colleague, but...

31:50.875 --> 31:53.459
I think I may have a solution
to your problem myself.

31:53.484 --> 31:55.572
Do you think you have
some time this week

31:55.574 --> 31:57.340
we could sit down and talk?

32:01.563 --> 32:03.712
- Chuck.
- Howard.

32:03.737 --> 32:05.162
What a nice surprise.

32:05.164 --> 32:07.650
I knocked, but there was no
answer. Thought you were asleep.

32:07.652 --> 32:09.786
Figured I'd wait, in case...

32:09.788 --> 32:12.389
Are those groceries? They are.

32:12.414 --> 32:14.791
I decided to go for a little walk.

32:14.793 --> 32:16.918
- That's great, Chuck.
- Why don't you come on in?

32:16.943 --> 32:18.289
Uh, thank you.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.241
To what do I owe the pleasure?

32:21.266 --> 32:23.410
Well, I wish it was just a social call,

32:23.435 --> 32:25.750
but unfortunately, we do have
an issue we need to discuss.

32:25.775 --> 32:27.108
What's that?

32:27.133 --> 32:29.505
It concerns your malpractice insurance.

32:29.507 --> 32:30.840
There's...

32:31.977 --> 32:35.016
well, we should sit and talk it through.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.557
Air Conditioning out of order.
We apologize for the inconvenience.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.188
You're good.

34:18.534 --> 34:19.900
Cool.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.558
See you, Nacho.

34:25.724 --> 34:27.683
Don Hector.

34:59.176 --> 35:00.612
What?

35:03.081 --> 35:05.065
This one looks funny.

35:09.510 --> 35:11.268
Bring it here.

35:27.219 --> 35:28.851
You see? Is it fake?

35:33.852 --> 35:36.204
No, it's fine.

35:41.079 --> 35:43.266
I'm so sorry, Don Hector.

36:39.991 --> 36:43.092
- Carlos.
- Nacho.

36:52.403 --> 36:54.370
I'm heavy.

36:54.372 --> 36:56.639
Took care of that problem over on Fifth.

36:56.641 --> 36:58.741
That crew won't bother us no more...

36:58.743 --> 37:00.928
Hey, do me a favor. Shut up.

37:06.709 --> 37:08.576
You're good.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.412
Okay.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.045
See you next week.

38:59.135 --> 39:01.408
Don Hector, more espresso?

39:57.720 --> 39:59.601
McGill.

39:59.626 --> 40:01.861
Keep it moving.

40:11.135 --> 40:13.696
- Sir. Sir.
- What's up?

40:13.721 --> 40:16.505
Hey, uh, it's... it's my kid.

40:16.507 --> 40:17.940
Her mom just called.

40:17.942 --> 40:19.908
You're not supposed to be on the phone.

40:19.910 --> 40:21.410
I know, I know, but she's sick.

40:21.412 --> 40:22.844
She caught pneumonia at day care.

40:22.846 --> 40:24.759
She's in the hospital. Please, can I go?

40:24.784 --> 40:27.148
Sure, you can go. But
you're not gettin' credit.

40:27.151 --> 40:29.500
C'mon, can I just go
and come right back?

40:29.525 --> 40:31.620
I have to get my hours done this week.

40:31.645 --> 40:33.009
Judge says so.

40:33.034 --> 40:34.790
Judge told you, huh?

40:34.792 --> 40:36.792
Sounds like that's on you.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.577
Hey, buddy, you wanna get outta here?

40:52.602 --> 40:55.437
- How much is it worth to you?
- What?

40:55.462 --> 40:57.228
To ditch this.

40:57.253 --> 41:00.280
- How much?
- Leave me alone, yo.

41:00.663 --> 41:03.185
Come on. You want to
get to your deal or what?

41:03.187 --> 41:05.552
Man, I was just tryin'
ta see my sick kid.

41:06.624 --> 41:08.357
You're trying to sell
something you shouldn't have

41:08.359 --> 41:10.466
to someone who shouldn't be buying it.

41:10.491 --> 41:13.426
Hey. No judgments, all right?

41:13.451 --> 41:16.787
Man's gotta make a living. I'm just
saying the way you make yours...

41:16.812 --> 41:18.920
rhymes with "mug mealer."

41:18.945 --> 41:20.592
Yeah. What are you... a narc?

41:20.617 --> 41:22.316
I'm the guy who's gonna
get you out of here

41:22.341 --> 41:24.491
- and let you keep your hours.
- Yeah?

41:24.516 --> 41:26.008
- Yeah.
- How you gonna do that?

41:26.010 --> 41:28.225
Lemme worry about the how, okay?

41:28.250 --> 41:29.978
You just...

41:29.980 --> 41:32.536
700 bucks, and you're gone.

41:32.561 --> 41:34.883
No, I don't have 700 bucks.

41:34.885 --> 41:38.220
Hey, you got a couple
grand in your sock.

41:41.558 --> 41:43.191
700 bucks.

41:43.193 --> 41:45.123
And you can get me outta here?

41:46.775 --> 41:48.075
Aight.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.998
You can do it, you got a deal.

41:51.217 --> 41:54.403
Okay. Just go pick up trash. Go on.

42:12.222 --> 42:14.656
The hell's this?

42:16.260 --> 42:19.161
Resting. Uh, hurt my back.

42:19.163 --> 42:20.662
Get up.

42:20.664 --> 42:23.665
Nope. My back's killing me.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.033
Suit yourself.

42:25.035 --> 42:26.883
You're not getting your hours.

42:26.908 --> 42:29.842
I'm pretty sure you're
gonna give me my hours.

42:29.867 --> 42:31.453
Oh, yeah?

42:31.478 --> 42:33.245
And how do you figure that?

42:33.270 --> 42:35.633
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna sue you.

42:36.908 --> 42:39.224
Hate to break it to you, smart guy,

42:39.249 --> 42:40.969
but you signed a waiver.

42:40.994 --> 42:43.060
I signed a waiver with the city.

42:43.085 --> 42:45.053
But I'm not suing the city.

42:45.055 --> 42:47.774
I'm suing you! Personally!

42:50.313 --> 42:52.227
You can't do that.

42:52.891 --> 42:54.444
Buddy...

42:57.461 --> 42:59.868
this is the land of the free
and the home of the lawsuit...

42:59.870 --> 43:01.470
I sure as shootin' can.

43:01.472 --> 43:02.871
And you know what?

43:02.896 --> 43:05.985
I think I'll bring that guy in with me

43:06.010 --> 43:08.276
and make it a class-action thing.

43:08.278 --> 43:09.829
What's he got to do with it?

43:09.854 --> 43:13.321
You knowingly prevented him from
visiting his child in the hospital.

43:13.346 --> 43:17.852
If that isn't intentional infliction
of emotional distress, what is?

43:17.877 --> 43:19.633
That's... crazy.

43:19.658 --> 43:21.266
Crazy hasn't even started.

43:21.291 --> 43:24.726
I can also sue you for failure to
approve community-service hours...

43:24.728 --> 43:27.180
that's a direct violation of your duties

43:27.205 --> 43:29.271
as an agent of the state of New Mexico.

43:29.296 --> 43:30.876
I'm only doin' my job...

43:30.901 --> 43:33.401
And just for tickles, maybe I throw in

43:33.426 --> 43:37.105
failure to treat and mitigate
damages suffered by me

43:37.107 --> 43:39.047
due to injuries sustained
under your watch.

43:39.072 --> 43:40.742
- Injury?
- My back.

43:40.744 --> 43:42.274
You're full of shit.

43:42.299 --> 43:44.112
- The waiver clearly states...
- Now, that waiver's

43:44.114 --> 43:46.915
gonna make Swiss cheese look solid.

43:46.917 --> 43:50.516
And in a personal lawsuit,
it's a fart in the wind.

43:52.122 --> 43:54.456
You're never gonna win that.

43:54.458 --> 43:56.468
Maybe. Maybe not.

43:56.493 --> 43:59.727
In order to find out, we
gotta do some math. Let's see.

43:59.752 --> 44:01.876
A lawyer's gonna cost you
about 90 bucks an hour.

44:01.901 --> 44:05.703
You're looking at 8 to 12
months of litigation, minimum.

44:06.180 --> 44:07.780
I'll represent myself.

44:07.805 --> 44:09.337
Great! Bring it on.

44:09.339 --> 44:10.872
You got a car? You got a house?

44:10.874 --> 44:13.405
A pension? Kiss it all goodbye.

44:13.430 --> 44:16.945
Look, out here, you might
be King Douche-nozzle,

44:16.947 --> 44:20.672
but in court, you are little people.

44:20.697 --> 44:22.204
Look, the judge and I...

44:22.229 --> 44:24.863
we'll gladly spend the next
five years in the courtroom.

44:24.888 --> 44:26.141
But for you, it's expensive.

44:26.166 --> 44:28.126
It's very, very expensive.

44:28.151 --> 44:30.419
It's third-mortgage expensive.

44:30.444 --> 44:34.302
So... I'm offering you a simple choice.

44:34.327 --> 44:35.746
You can go to your wife.

44:35.771 --> 44:37.966
You can explain to her
you're about to lose your job,

44:37.968 --> 44:40.888
your pension, and whatever
pinhole of a reputation

44:40.913 --> 44:43.614
you've got at the bowling
alley on Glow-ball Sundays,

44:43.639 --> 44:48.019
or let my friend here visit his
sick daughter in the hospital,

44:48.044 --> 44:49.578
and you can let me rest my back

44:49.580 --> 44:53.982
on this sacred, now
litter-free New Mexico soil.

44:53.984 --> 44:56.751
Oh, and we keep our hours.

45:03.631 --> 45:05.380
Fine.

45:06.561 --> 45:08.427
Asshole.

45:12.601 --> 45:14.468
Well, go on!

45:14.906 --> 45:17.005
Get outta here.

45:18.609 --> 45:19.908
Hey, man.

45:19.910 --> 45:23.411
That was some Jedi
mind shit right there!

45:28.719 --> 45:31.719
The best $700 I done ever spent.

45:36.643 --> 45:38.260
Here you go.

45:38.262 --> 45:39.619
I'm out.

45:44.135 --> 45:45.767
Yeah, yeah.

45:45.769 --> 45:48.236
Yo, I'm on my way. Yeah, yeah.

46:49.499 --> 46:52.361
I've got a problem I
think you can help me with.

46:52.386 --> 46:54.986
I've got cash I can't spend.

46:55.305 --> 46:58.212
About $200,000.

46:58.759 --> 47:00.508
If anything happens to me,

47:00.510 --> 47:03.165
my family'll never see it.

47:04.514 --> 47:07.704
Now, it seems to me
you opened this place

47:07.729 --> 47:10.673
to solve a similar problem.

47:11.775 --> 47:16.725
And you think that solution
could be applied to you.

47:16.727 --> 47:19.368
As a one-time arrangement.

47:21.351 --> 47:24.666
It would be unwise for us
to be publicly associated,

47:24.668 --> 47:26.281
wouldn't you agree?

47:27.203 --> 47:29.137
Because of the Salamancas.

47:29.139 --> 47:31.239
If they were to take notice,

47:31.241 --> 47:35.047
there would be
consequences for both of us.

47:39.195 --> 47:42.047
I'm thinking a paper transaction.

47:42.072 --> 47:43.625
Even so.

47:46.859 --> 47:48.890
Perhaps there is a way.

47:49.563 --> 47:52.391
One with a degree more...

47:52.416 --> 47:54.182
difficulty.

47:54.207 --> 47:57.000
But one I may be able to arrange.

47:58.535 --> 48:02.137
Would 20% overcome this difficulty?

48:03.604 --> 48:06.419
I would not take money from your family.
