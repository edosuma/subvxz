00:01.400 --> 00:03.360
Something strange is happening.

00:07.160 --> 00:09.320
-What do you do?
-Monitoring tidal fluctuation.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.280
And other possible stressors
on the ecosystem.

00:16.240 --> 00:17.720
What do you think is going on?

00:17.880 --> 00:20.240
-They've been late before.
-Not this late.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.240
What the hell is that?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.960
It's methane hydrate. Fire ice.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.920
Looks like a hell of a lot.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.840
-Send me the data.
-Of course.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.760
-Whales are back.
-I know!

00:39.280 --> 00:40.320
Lizzie, no!

01:38.480 --> 01:40.560
I'm telling you.
Look at this morning's catch.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.800
Here we go. It's nearly time.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.560
Put it there.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.040
The lobsters go there.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.760
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.320
Plenty of choice today.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.960
Yeah, not bad.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.320
This could work. Maybe a little light.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.480
It will do for ravioli or a salad, no?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.400
So now it's you planning my menu?

02:05.560 --> 02:08.480
Well, what do I know.
I can't afford your prices anyway.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.640
Soon I won't be able
to afford yours, either.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.640
Okay, this one is fine.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.520
Put this on ice, please.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.320
It's fine.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.440
Gilberto!

03:38.680 --> 03:41.840
Get rid of the lobster
and clean up this mess!

03:42.520 --> 03:44.000
Of course.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.120
Get rid of it.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.280
Gilberto, finish this.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.480
I'm going to get some air.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.320
I'd like to get out of here
before midnight.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.640
He's a sous chef.
He works in the kitchen at Le Sinquet.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.280
-Where we went for your birthday?
-Yeah.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.400
He came in this morning,
his clothes soiled with black vomit.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.040
High fever, acute diarrhea.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.880
I had to induce a coma.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.080
-The chef also collapsed outside.
-When?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.480
Last night.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.360
His clothes were covered
in the same vomit.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.640
He died before we could get to him.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.360
We're waiting for permission
from his family to do an autopsy.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.760
Sorry.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
Let me know when you get the results.
Thank you, Sophia.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.240
-What happened?
-Dad left for Antwerp.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.040
-He had a meeting.
-But what about Tanya?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.480
-She's in Portugal.
-He doesn't know.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.960
-What?
-That we left.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.680
Mom, there's nothing to do there.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.720
We don't know anybody. He's never home.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.920
-You should have called me anyway.
-I know how to get on a train.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.640
-We almost got on the wrong train.
-Shut up.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.960
You can't leave like that.
What if something happened to you?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.480
-What do you expect to happen?
-That's not the point, Isabelle.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.800
We just have to know where you are.
That's it.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.840
Okay, we'll talk about this later.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.880
Don't touch anything, I'll be back.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.840
-Why did you even say that?
-Shut up.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.480
You're such an idiot.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.640
Three weeks
and you couldn't find the time...

09:19.800 --> 09:22.040
-Something came up.
-Something always comes up.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.040
I have to work, Cécile.
You have to work.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.200
We all...
I'll be back in Brussels tomorrow.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.840
-I'll take them to...
-They are here, Michael.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.400
-What?
-They came home.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
-By themselves?
-Yes, by themselves!

09:38.160 --> 09:40.160
I'll drive down at the weekend,
I'll bring them back.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.960
Do you really think I'm going to
let them go back?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.800
Cécile, come on.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.640
They shouldn't have left.
I've told them as much.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.080
But they were alone,
and I hear it's not the first time.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.920
And you never leave them alone?

09:52.080 --> 09:54.320
Of course I do. But not overnight,

09:54.480 --> 09:56.240
without someone coming to stay.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.760
And not on their holidays when I've
promised we'll spend time together.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.640
Do you just expect them
to sit around and wait for you?

10:03.800 --> 10:05.280
Yes, actually. They're children!

10:05.440 --> 10:06.880
Yes, children.
In a city they don't know.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.920
Without their father.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.000
I have to go.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.800
Call them. In a few days.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.200
Hello.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.040
Hi.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.200
Nothing to eat?

11:11.360 --> 11:13.640
If you wanted something,
you should have told me.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.680
I thought you'd surprise me.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.880
Looks like I did.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.960
-What do you want?
-No, no, I'll get it.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.280
My turn to surprise you.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.480
She thinks being on holiday

11:35.640 --> 11:37.480
means six meals a day.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.040
You're giving a talk. On whale song.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.520
There's a flyer in our hotel.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.480
I was.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.160
Got cancelled,
with everything that's happened.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.640
Must have been terrible.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.240
You're a cetologist?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.760
You?

12:10.400 --> 12:12.360
You look out there,

12:14.400 --> 12:17.120
I look up there.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.400
-Astronomer?
-Astrophysicist.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.600
They say we know more about space
than the oceans.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.000
Not sure who "they" is.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.200
My parents once asked me
why I wanted to spend my life

12:38.360 --> 12:41.560
searching for something
no one even knew existed.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.280
-What did you say?
-Hope.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.960
Sounded good at the time.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.880
Deep down, though,

12:54.400 --> 12:57.800
the idea of not being alone is...

12:59.160 --> 13:01.680
strangely comforting.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.240
I should get going.

13:13.800 --> 13:14.920
Here.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.080
We're staying
a few more nights at the Inn.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.800
If you feel like talking...

13:24.280 --> 13:25.720
send me a message.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.840
AA137 has just landed.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.960
Professor, welcome aboard.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.520
Captain.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.840
-You're older, Sigur.
-By six years.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.240
You haven't aged at all, though, Jasper.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.920
Maybe just no aging left to do.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.480
Surprised you're still doing
the northern tour.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.520
Never one for the heat.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.480
Or land, for that matter.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.400
Hello, Sigur.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.560
Tina.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.560
Shall we head below?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.000
Eighty meters.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.680
One hundred meters.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.960
Steer zero-one-four.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.640
They should come into view
right about...

15:59.480 --> 16:00.480
now.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
Sirsoe methanicola.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.600
What's that?

16:13.760 --> 16:15.160
Ice worms.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.000
How long have they been here?

16:17.160 --> 16:18.880
We came across them a few days ago.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.040
I thought you said
they covered fifty square meters.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.720
They did when we first discovered them.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.360
-Are you sure we're in the same spot?
-Let me double-check.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.600
Same spot.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.480
Can you get closer?

16:41.560 --> 16:42.720
What are they doing?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.160
They are feeding.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.320
-On what?
-You see those brown patches?

16:49.480 --> 16:51.800
That's the bacterial mat
which the worms feed on.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.240
The white spots are
patches of frozen methane.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.360
Do you have the footage
from the original dive?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.400
-We do.
-I'd like to see that.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.760
I'll have someone set it up for you.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.040
Could you turn that up?

17:28.760 --> 17:29.800
What was that?

17:29.960 --> 17:32.640
Sometimes we get
some sort of interference

17:33.600 --> 17:35.520
from kinks in the tether.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.160
There, picture.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.960
Picture.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.680
Thank you.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.240
Picture.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.040
Picture.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.120
-Could you upload these?
-All of them, professor?

18:21.280 --> 18:22.680
Please.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.160
Will you do the honors?

18:35.920 --> 18:38.080
You did not get this in the canteen.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.400
Thought it might
make the meal go down easier.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.760
So, you had something to show me.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.280
Right, there are species of
ice worm living this far north,

19:07.440 --> 19:10.720
but none of them have teeth,
let alone jaws like this.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.040
And that's not all.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.600
Ice worms are broadcast spawners.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.680
It means they spew billions of sperm,
eggs, into the water,

19:21.840 --> 19:23.520
very few of which are fertilized.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.200
And those that are?
Well, they take weeks to hatch.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.440
There is no known species
that can reproduce fast enough

19:29.600 --> 19:32.240
to cover an area this big
in just a few days.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.280
And also, they're bigger.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.160
Almost double the size of the ones
you spotted a few days ago, so I...

19:38.800 --> 19:41.680
I mean, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear, but...

19:41.840 --> 19:45.240
I think it's a pretty good guess
that we're looking at a new species.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.280
And if we are,

19:49.520 --> 19:52.000
then I'll name it after you.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.400
You can think of it
as a parting gift from an old friend.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.560
I'll send you some names
of the experts in the field

20:03.720 --> 20:05.440
so you can follow up.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.840
-I'd rather stick with you.
-Tina.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.160
It won't be like the last time.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.080
-It won't.
-It will. 'Cause it's the only way...

20:13.320 --> 20:15.720
No, I wouldn't have called you
if that were true.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.760
You called me because you need me.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.000
Hovedstad Energy needs me.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.080
We do. But that doesn't mean that...

20:23.240 --> 20:26.480
The government is opening up
fifty new fields in the Norwegian Sea.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.760
For the exploration of oil,
gas hydrates,

20:28.920 --> 20:30.960
minerals which no one
will be allowed to develop

20:31.120 --> 20:33.880
unless you get a clean bill of health
from the environmental groups

20:34.040 --> 20:35.840
breathing down Hovedstad's neck.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.960
Which is why you'd like to add my name

20:38.200 --> 20:40.320
to the list of other experts
you've consulted.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.200
-We're doing it right this time.
-You say that.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.600
No, I'm not just saying that. I mean it.

20:45.760 --> 20:50.200
If the worms, or anything we discover,
proves to be environmentally sensitive,

20:50.360 --> 20:52.440
it will be in my report.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.480
Nothing will be deleted
or buried in the footnotes.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.240
And if it kills Hovedstad's plan
to develop the site?

20:58.400 --> 21:00.200
It will still be in my report.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.080
Okay, but this time,
when you write your report,

21:11.240 --> 21:13.480
before you submit it, I sign it.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.600
Every page. Top, bottom.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.080
Okay.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.000
How long did you run the test?

21:36.160 --> 21:38.320
A little over twenty-four hours.

21:38.480 --> 21:42.080
As you can see, the worms ate
right through the bacterial mat.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.160
And then carried on into the ice.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.600
Which explains their teeth
and oversized jaws.

21:47.840 --> 21:51.040
But it doesn't explain
why they ate through the bacterium.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.600
There's nothing in the ice
for them to feed on.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.120
Whatever the reason,
they kept going until they suffocated.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.720
Why would they do that?

21:59.880 --> 22:02.960
Some species display
self-destructive behavior.

22:03.120 --> 22:07.520
Sometimes it's population control,
you know, sacrifice for the group.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.400
-But that doesn't seem to be the case.
-It doesn't.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.720
We checked the rate of reproduction
of the bacterium as well.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.280
It's faster
than any other known bacterium.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.840
It looks like you've stumbled on
a new species of ice worms,

22:23.120 --> 22:25.200
and also a new strain of bacterium.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.240
Smack in the middle of
Hovedstad's fields in the Norwegian Sea.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.240
We'll write up our findings
and send the report to...

22:31.480 --> 22:32.920
To me.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.800
Copied to Sigur.

22:35.440 --> 22:38.240
I'll circulate it to the people
who need to know at Hovedstad.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.000
-Is there somewhere I can make a call?
-You can use my office.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.000
So, what do you think they'll say?

22:56.720 --> 22:58.040
What, Hovedstad?

22:59.360 --> 23:01.840
Not much they can say.
It's a new species.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.760
It's fact, it's not up for debate.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.280
Sure, the information is fact,

23:05.520 --> 23:08.720
but what they decide to do about it,
that's another question.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.840
Yeah, you're right, it's true.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.360
Unfortunately, it's not my decision.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.800
So that's it?

23:17.960 --> 23:20.560
You deliver your report,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.560
collect your check and... move on?

23:24.320 --> 23:28.000
-That's enough, Rahim.
-No, no, it's fine.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.440
Listen, you, why don't you

23:30.600 --> 23:32.640
fight your battles your way?

23:32.880 --> 23:34.880
And I'll fight them mine.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.160
Katharina, thank you.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.840
And just be sure to
copy me, with the report.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.200
-Sure.
-Yeah.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.680
You are entitled to your own opinion,

23:48.920 --> 23:50.760
whether I agree with it or not.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.320
But what you are not entitled to do
is to insult someone

23:54.480 --> 23:57.120
with whom this Institute has dealings.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.080
You want to challenge Dr. Johanson?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.960
Go to Trondheim,
sit in one of his lectures.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.840
And when he asks for questions, ask him.

24:10.920 --> 24:15.120
Until then, you pay him
the respect that he deserves.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.360
So what should we do about them?

24:54.520 --> 24:56.320
Do about them?

24:56.480 --> 24:59.480
Your worms. What do we do about them?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.360
You proceed,

25:01.520 --> 25:03.640
under Norway's rules
for ecological impact

25:03.800 --> 25:05.680
on seabed oil and gas operations.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.720
What we're asking, Dr. Johanson,

25:07.880 --> 25:11.520
is if there is anything we can do
to expedite the process?

25:13.640 --> 25:17.120
Well, assuming that
you want to do this by the book...

25:17.280 --> 25:19.760
Which I assured Dr. Johanson we do.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.120
Whether or not
you need to cease operating

25:22.280 --> 25:24.280
depends on how widespread
the species is.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.800
If it's distributed
over a much larger area

25:26.960 --> 25:29.080
than the area
disturbed by the operation,

25:29.240 --> 25:31.880
then I see no major risk
for biodiversity loss.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.560
And so you proceed. It's not a problem.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.800
However, if it isn't,

25:38.720 --> 25:40.360
then you have to stop.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.200
Which is why we need to go back
and have another look.

25:46.440 --> 25:50.120
See how far they've spread,
take some more sediment samples.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.920
It seems like your worms
are doing far more harm to themselves

25:55.160 --> 25:57.480
than anything we could do to them.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.600
Aaren, I'm not trying to stop you.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.960
I'm trying to do the job
you hired me to do.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.760
Which is to make sure we do things

26:03.920 --> 26:06.840
in the most environmentally
responsible way possible.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.200
I spoke to Captain Alban.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.960
We can charter the Thorvaldson
for another week, two, if we need it.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.880
The sooner we get back out there,

26:17.040 --> 26:19.760
the sooner we'll know
the extent of the problem.

26:25.080 --> 26:29.200
Fine.
And Aaren, I want you to go with them.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.400
Happy to.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.200
I'm sure you can use
an extra pair of hands.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.320
Always.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.880
Yeah, well, I'm just looking forward
to the pleasure of your company.

26:43.640 --> 26:46.520
-Aaren is exactly how I remember him.
-I would argue worse.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.120
-Yeah.
-And Erika?

26:48.280 --> 26:49.720
-Well, she's better.
-At what?

26:49.880 --> 26:53.000
Saying something
without actually saying anything.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.120
So, do you need a ride?

26:58.280 --> 26:59.640
I have one, thanks.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.680
Yeah, okay. So...

27:05.960 --> 27:07.600
I'll just see you out there, then.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.920
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.800
-See you back out there.
-Sure.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.520
-Did it go well?
-Yes.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.360
Did anyone else not show up today?

27:36.560 --> 27:39.520
-One of the apprentices.
-Did you hear from them?

27:41.280 --> 27:44.320
Do you have the address?
I will go check on them.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.600
-Yes. In my office.
-Okay.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.320
Can you also make me a copy

27:48.480 --> 27:51.160
of your reservation list
from last night, please?

27:51.400 --> 27:53.640
So I can check if anybody else got sick.

27:56.280 --> 27:59.000
-Must have been the lobster.
-The lobster?

27:59.680 --> 28:03.320
Yeah, the chef, Monsieur Bouquillon,
he was preparing it and it...

28:04.800 --> 28:05.800
What?

28:06.040 --> 28:07.760
It just burst.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.000
What happened to the lobster?

28:13.160 --> 28:15.200
Gilberto, he started
to clean up the mess.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.680
And then the apprentice, Alaina,
she threw it away.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.520
Where?

28:21.520 --> 28:23.480
Down the waste disposal.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.960
Gilberto, is he...

28:29.280 --> 28:31.760
He's in good hands. I promise.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.560
Oxygen, adrenaline, now!

29:50.440 --> 29:52.880
Hold him down! Hold him down!

30:22.360 --> 30:23.400
Alaina?

30:31.040 --> 30:32.560
Anybody there?

30:49.480 --> 30:52.720
-Yes?
-Cécile, where are you?

30:52.880 --> 30:54.520
The apprentice's flat.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.600
We just lost Miguel Gilberto.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.040
Cécile?

31:05.760 --> 31:07.720
Cécile, are you there?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.400
Leon Anawak.
Vancouver Island Marine Institute.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.160
Here to see Clive Roberts.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.880
Let him through.

32:17.080 --> 32:20.640
Eighteen days ago, everything in order.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.320
Entered Canadian waters yesterday.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.400
Nothing unusual.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.920
Then, I can't control.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.080
No response when I try to steer.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.040
You lost power?

32:37.200 --> 32:39.720
No, no, we have power.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.000
Rudder not working.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.560
Jammed.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.320
Tugboats came, attached cables.

32:53.640 --> 32:58.280
I saw a shadow underwater,

32:58.440 --> 33:00.800
coming fast toward us and the tugboats.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.520
The shadow got closer.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.200
And then it went down.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.760
Disappeared.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.720
And... then it came up.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.800
Out of the water.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.760
A humpback whale

33:20.080 --> 33:22.800
landed onto the tugboat.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.960
And a second humpback
landed onto another tugboat.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.760
You seen any other whales?
Any calves, any small ones?

33:34.160 --> 33:35.160
No, no.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.400
Just two big ones.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.400
Why did you ask about the calves?

33:43.200 --> 33:46.320
Whales have been known
to attack ships to protect their young.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.080
Or when they're mating.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.600
But they don't mate in these waters.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.800
We've been hearing reports
of other incidents

33:54.960 --> 33:57.080
up the coast and in the States, too.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.040
It's causing hell for all of us.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.280
Ships backed up, waiting to dock.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.480
We're trying to get the go-ahead

34:03.640 --> 34:05.920
to reroute some freighters
to Prince Rupert.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
No wonder the rudder was jammed.
Never seen this many mussels.

34:11.720 --> 34:16.440
Captain Nakamura told me the hull
was clean when they sailed from Tokyo.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.480
Mind if I...

34:22.760 --> 34:24.520
We've got plenty to spare.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.880
Okay, let it down.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.440
Slowly.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.040
Little more.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.600
-Hi.
-Hey.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.280
Seven-one-four meters.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.160
They're bigger.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.240
They're much bigger.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.000
And there's more of them.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.800
Ready to deploy, captain.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.200
What? What's wrong?

36:22.920 --> 36:24.280
Corer's broken through.

36:50.480 --> 36:51.960
Oh my God!

36:52.200 --> 36:53.600
What happened?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.920
I'll be on the bridge.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.120
When the corer
punched through the seabed,

37:20.280 --> 37:22.640
it released the methane trapped beneath.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.360
You see that from time to time
on oil rigs:

37:24.600 --> 37:28.440
an uncontrolled release of crude oil
after pressure control systems fail.

37:31.040 --> 37:35.240
If you would've been on a smaller ship,
you might have gone down.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.760
Professor Lehmann.
I've got it up on screen.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.040
We looked at the section of sediment
you brought us

37:45.280 --> 37:46.880
to see if we could figure out

37:47.040 --> 37:49.040
why the corer
punched through the seabed.

37:49.680 --> 37:53.520
But this time,
we let the test run longer.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.360
And we discovered that
the holes on the ice kept getting deeper

37:57.520 --> 37:59.320
even after the worms had died.

38:03.840 --> 38:08.040
If it isn't the worms, is something else
eating through the ice?

38:08.200 --> 38:09.400
It is.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.040
-The bacteria.
-Yes.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.440
And if nothing stops them,
how deep can they go?

38:17.400 --> 38:19.840
All the way to the bottom, I'd imagine.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.560
The amount of methane released
would be minimal.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.440
It would never make it
to the atmosphere.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.680
So there's no need to be concerned
about the greenhouse effect.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.120
But given how fast
the worms are reproducing,

38:33.280 --> 38:35.200
it's probably worth a look to see

38:35.440 --> 38:37.560
if anyone else out there has found
the same worms.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.080
-Here.
-Thank you.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.320
Sure.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.320
You okay?

39:03.560 --> 39:04.680
Yeah.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.800
I just didn't realize
what a close call we all had.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.640
Yeah, neither did I.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.960
There's a conference in Geneva tomorrow

39:18.120 --> 39:20.720
hosted by
the International Energy Council.

39:22.400 --> 39:26.000
I wasn't planning to go,
but after I heard what Katharina said...

39:27.400 --> 39:29.080
It might be a good opportunity
to find out

39:29.240 --> 39:31.360
if anyone else
has found the same worms.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.360
Yeah. So you should go.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.400
I was hoping you would come with me.

39:44.360 --> 39:48.440
I have a pretty heavy class load
next semester.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.640
And I've just been away
more than I should.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.960
We could go and get back in a day.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.640
-Two at the most.
-Tina.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.120
Look, I work for Hovedstad.

40:00.680 --> 40:03.160
People won't be as comfortable
talking to me.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.560
You heard what Katharina said.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.000
If it had been a smaller ship,
we would've gone down.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.480
There's someone I know
who can find out for us...

40:16.080 --> 40:18.960
what, if anything,
anyone has discovered.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.840
One day.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.080
I'll set something up.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.600
Thank you.

40:56.760 --> 40:57.800
Okay. Enough.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.200
I need air, and food, and a drink.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.240
Starting with a drink.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.200
Are you coming?

41:09.360 --> 41:11.480
-Five minutes.
-Okay.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.720
See you up top.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.040
Hi.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.240
-There you go.
-You're the best.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.920
-And for you.
-Thanks.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.560
Bit heavy for a Friday night, isn't it?

42:10.320 --> 42:12.640
What can I say? My idea of fun.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.360
You're welcome to join me,

42:16.520 --> 42:19.440
but I have a very demanding professor
waiting for this data.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.320
As tempting as that sounds,
I think I'll leave you to it.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.320
But if you want, you know, conversation,

42:25.480 --> 42:26.760
a normal drink at the pub?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.520
We're over there.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.360
-Five minutes.
-I'll take it.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.160
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.000
Happy birthday!

43:34.840 --> 43:37.480
Charlie. Thanks for the message.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.960
Thirty.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.000
How... how did that happen?

43:48.880 --> 43:51.600
Wish you were here to soften the blow.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.600
We could relive
some of last year's madness.

43:58.880 --> 44:01.640
Maybe not. Considering.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.840
Anyway, hope the reason
you're not answering

44:09.000 --> 44:12.080
is because you're with
that hot guy from the boat.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.880
Miss you.
