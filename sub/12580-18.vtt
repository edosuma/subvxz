00:44.811 --> 00:46.642
Twenty years with Dale.

00:46.746 --> 00:49.840
And one year since you stopped
cheating on him with John Redcorn.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.281
I can still wear white, can't l?

00:52.385 --> 00:53.352
Mmm.... Uh-uh.

00:53.620 --> 00:56.714
But, sug', if I don't wear white,
Dale might get suspicious.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.121
And right now,
the only ones who know about the affair...

00:59.225 --> 01:01.591
are me, John Redcorn, and God.

And you, and Hank,
and Bill, and Boomhauer...

01:06.633 --> 01:10.626

and, of course, John Redcorn's sister.

-Well, it's your funeral.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.008

01:28.121 --> 01:31.181
and she's been dying to use
her calligraphy kit.

01:31.791 --> 01:34.225
Odd, vexing.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.795
My father's name is on the list.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.159

I want this re-wedding
to be a fresh start for all of us.

02:54.641 --> 02:58.441
If I can forgive him for tongue-stabbing me
on my holy day, why can't you?

02:58.545 --> 03:02.481
He probably misses you, Dale.
I know I miss my dad.

03:02.815 --> 03:07.115
I can't tell you how many nights
he locked me in that rabbit hutch.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.445
I deserved it, though. I just couldn't listen.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.184
My dad doesn't care about me.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.557
He's the big rodeo star,
going town to town...

03:15.662 --> 03:18.358
delighting children and defiling women.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.095
And right in the middle
of the re-wedding...

03:23.203 --> 03:26.764
I pop out of the cake with two sparklers.

03:26.906 --> 03:31.070
I like it. I like it a lot,
except for the part about you.

03:31.177 --> 03:34.340
But the cake part,
now, that is an excellent idea.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.006

03:42.388 --> 03:43.855
I have a favor to ask.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.619
Would you bring this invite to Dale's dad?

03:46.726 --> 03:49.194
-Nancy--
-Hank, it's been 20 years.

03:49.295 --> 03:52.526
Maybe Bug has changed. I've changed.

03:54.167 --> 03:57.193
If he has, invite him
so he can give Dale away again.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.669

and to go to hell.

03:59.772 --> 04:03.139
I don't know. Bug's a cowboy.
How do you find a cowboy?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.370

04:05.478 --> 04:07.537
was gonna be in Coburn,
through the end of the month.

04:07.647 --> 04:11.378
-Pretty please.
-Well, I guess I am the best man.

04:11.484 --> 04:15.682
And with the joy of responsibility
comes the burden of obligation.

04:18.992 --> 04:22.393
I wonder why so many cowboys
have mustaches.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.604
Don't worry, Grandpa.
That goat's getting pantied.

12:58.711 --> 13:02.442
Yeah, I bet some babe at the rodeo
threw those panties at my dad...

13:02.548 --> 13:04.539
and he kept them as a souvenir.

13:04.650 --> 13:05.617
[Goat braying]

13:07.353 --> 13:09.344
-Yep.
-Yep.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.752
Mmm-hmm.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.381
Yep.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.657
Oh, my turn?

13:15.961 --> 13:17.019
Yep.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.699
Bug Gribble's taxi service.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.996
Oh, God. I completely forgot.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.733
Dale, this is Juan Pedro, my special friend.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.800
Nice to meet you.

13:31.277 --> 13:35.043
Any special friend of my dad's
is a special friend of mine.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.981
These are my special friends,
Hank, Bill, and Boomhauer.

13:40.753 --> 13:41.981
Hey, man.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.917
Son, I'm so sorry.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.817
Juan Pedro and I have plans tonight.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.659
But, Dad, you were supposed
to go to the gun club...

13:52.765 --> 13:54.858
to show my buddies your pistol twirling.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.095
But we were supposed to play
Taboo with Gary and Mike tonight.

13:58.204 --> 14:02.140
Oh, I'm in quite the pickle.
What to do? What to do?

14:02.274 --> 14:05.971
Look, Juan Pedro, why don't you come
to the gun club with us tonight...

14:06.078 --> 14:09.912
then tomorrow we can all go
to Gary and Mike's and play Taboo.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.644
Well, okay.
We can do Gary and Mike anytime.

14:14.086 --> 14:17.021
-And wait till you try my margaritas.
-Great.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.612
Hank likes margaritas.

14:18.724 --> 14:21.522
Hey, Hank, you coming over
to Gary and Mike's tomorrow...

14:21.627 --> 14:23.595
for margaritas and Taboo?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.288
Nope.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.661
Oh, I know you. Hello, Hank.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.898
Hello, Juan Pedro.

14:32.571 --> 14:36.234
I never knew you could buy ties
that weren't pre-tied.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.776
Oh, sweetie, I have so much to teach you.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.741
Speaking of which, Dad...

14:40.846 --> 14:43.781
I'm a little nervous
about my re-wedding night.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.478
You've satisfied thousands of women.
You got any pointers?

14:48.687 --> 14:51.315
Check it out, Dad. I'm John Redcorn.

14:52.758 --> 14:56.387
I don't see it.
I'll show you how to do John Redcorn.

14:56.495 --> 14:57.792
Excuse us.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.532
Joseph is such a beautiful boy.

15:05.170 --> 15:08.037
Is he adopted?

15:08.173 --> 15:10.869
No, not exactly. He's....

15:12.311 --> 15:15.439
Well, he's.... It's a long story.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.515
-Nancy.
-I know, I know.

15:18.617 --> 15:23.520
I must re-channel the energy
of your wife's ancestors' spirit winds.

15:28.060 --> 15:31.120
-Have you told Dale, yet?
-I've thought about it.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.993
But telling your husband
you cheated on him...

15:33.098 --> 15:35.430
is such an unpleasant conversation.

15:35.534 --> 15:39.061
I think the party'll be much more fun
if you and I just stay in the closet.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.605
I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your life...

15:41.707 --> 15:44.471
-but I can't do that anymore.
-No.

15:44.576 --> 15:48.273
Dale needs to know his daddy
is queerer than a box of birds.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.846
Get away from my wife...

15:50.950 --> 15:54.249
or next time
I'll aim for the mannequin and hit you.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.821
Dale, there's something
I need to get off my chest.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.392
If we're gonna have
a real relationship again...

16:01.493 --> 16:04.656
we should be 100%% Oprah honest
with each other.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.822
Are you in love with Nancy?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.295
I'm not the man you think I am.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.599
My rodeo is a gay rodeo.

16:13.706 --> 16:18.268
Why would a confirmed bachelor
such as yourself work at a gay rodeo?

16:18.377 --> 16:21.175
Honey, even when I was married
to your mother...

16:21.280 --> 16:24.147
I was leading a secret life, don't you see?

16:24.683 --> 16:27.846
Juan Pedro is not just my special friend...

16:27.953 --> 16:30.217
-he's my partner.
-Partner?

16:30.322 --> 16:33.416
Why do you need a partner
to work the gay rodeo?

16:33.525 --> 16:36.221
Wait a minute. You're....

16:36.328 --> 16:40.025
Oh, my God! I can't believe this.
My own father.

16:40.132 --> 16:43.101
Dale, forget I said anything.
We were having so much fun.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.227
Let's go back to being a family again.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.204
Too late.
You're re-uninvited to my re-wedding.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.207
-Now, get out!
-Dale, please.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.743
Get out. I can never trust you again.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.643
Get out,
before I have Nancy throw you out.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.275
-Oh, sug'.
-I can't believe it.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.514
It was right in front of my face
this whole time.

17:04.056 --> 17:07.388
My father is a government agent.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.761
-He told you that?
-He didn't have to.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.731
A secret life,
working undercover with a partner?

17:14.833 --> 17:17.165
What other explanation is there?

17:18.771 --> 17:22.537
Oh, God.
This is my worst nightmare come true.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.068
Nancy, I don't know what to do.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.906
No one's ever deceived me before.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.155
I guess I can fit in one more beer
before the ceremony.

17:39.258 --> 17:43.024
Can you believe it?
My own dad is government.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.526
I really thought I knew the man.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.760
Now, what illicit activities
could gay cowboys be up to?

17:49.868 --> 17:54.032
Money-laundering,
income-tax evasion, counterfeiting?

17:54.139 --> 17:58.200
Are you sure that's what he told you?
That he was a fed?

17:58.310 --> 18:00.744
First, he deep-tongue kisses my wife...

18:00.846 --> 18:03.974
then he crawls into bed
with the federal government.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.573
Dale, where are you going?

18:05.684 --> 18:09.518
To the gay rodeo
to blow my dad's cover wide open.

18:12.491 --> 18:15.289
Oh, no, no, no, no! I can't find the ring.

18:15.394 --> 18:19.194
That was just a piece of tinfoil
we gave you to make you feel important.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.265
Oh, thank God.

18:24.903 --> 18:25.961
Hey!

18:27.906 --> 18:29.066
Oh, sorry.

18:32.711 --> 18:36.408
This was supposed to be my fresh start,
my new beginning.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.574
Why is God punishing me?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.585
Why, sug'?

18:40.686 --> 18:42.313
You know, baby.
Ain't no question about it.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.355

18:44.456 --> 18:45.423
Mmm-hmm.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.757
I'm here to expose you for what you are.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.453
An undercover government agent.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.523
A government agent?

19:25.631 --> 19:28.429
Oh, sweetie,
there's been a huge misunderstanding.

-lf only that were true.

I did not even know you had a son.

He might have more.
He has a bottomless appetite for women.
