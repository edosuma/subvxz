Isn't stealing the mail
a federal offense?

13:20.041 --> 13:23.750
It's my report card,
so technically no.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.834
[footsteps]
Someone's coming.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.959
[groans]

13:42.375 --> 13:45.083
Time for plan B.
What's plan B?

13:45.083 --> 13:47.709
Catch that mailman.

13:47.709 --> 13:50.542
Oh, yay. We used to play
that at camp.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.583
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.750
Whoa, he's really trucking.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.166
You would too if Oscar
were on your tail.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.458
[barking]

13:58.458 --> 14:00.166
Maybe it'd just be easier

14:00.166 --> 14:01.291
to be honest with your dad.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.750
No time for the truth.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.417
Besides, I want
that souvenir shard
of wreckage.

14:16.166 --> 14:17.834
Here's your mail.

14:17.834 --> 14:19.834
Oh, thank you.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.583
[screams]

14:25.166 --> 14:27.083
[Kick]
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.166
Well, that was easy.
Yep.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.458
Just gotta hide this
till after the derby.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.208
At which point, I will be
too immersed in awesomeness

14:40.208 --> 14:41.458
to care about my punishment.

14:41.458 --> 14:44.041
Yay, another happy ending.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.417
[laughs]
This is gonna be too easy.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.959
Hey, Kick. I couldn't help
but overhear

14:49.959 --> 14:52.208
that you're trying to hide
your report card from Dad.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.917
Don't worry, the Brad
is here to help. Yeah, Brad.

14:54.917 --> 14:57.792
Yay, another happy ending.

14:57.792 --> 15:00.750
So, out of concern
and sympathy for you,

15:00.750 --> 15:03.166
my brother, I humbly offer

15:03.166 --> 15:06.083
this hiding place
for your report card.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.750
Save it, Brad.
I don't want your--

15:08.750 --> 15:11.542
Hey, hey, get me outta here.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.417
[laughs]

15:16.417 --> 15:19.458
A proper dillweed burial. Mom!

15:19.458 --> 15:22.166
Kick's trying to hide
his report card.
[gasps]

15:22.166 --> 15:23.208
Mom, hey, hey, Mom.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.917
Mm-hmm.
Mom, you gotta see this.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.166
Do you mind?
I'm on the phone.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.917
But--
I don't want to hear
another word.

15:28.917 --> 15:32.709
Mm-hmm. Yes, well, I've
always felt that--
Hello, I'm home.

15:32.709 --> 15:35.083
Ooh, Dad.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.041
Dad, Kick is trying to hide
his report card from you

15:40.041 --> 15:43.417
because he knows if you
see it, you won't take him
to the demolition derby.

15:43.417 --> 15:46.834
What?

15:46.834 --> 15:48.750
What was that, Bradley?
I couldn't hear you.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.750
I was trying out
these sweet new headphones.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.917
I said Kick is trying to--

15:55.417 --> 15:57.917
Kick, what are you
doing covered
in that filthy laundry?

15:57.917 --> 16:00.959
Jeez, Brad, you're
not looking so hot.

16:01.959 --> 16:04.041
Dad, Kick's--

16:07.208 --> 16:10.500
All right, boys. No fighting
in my mail-reading room.

16:19.625 --> 16:20.959
[screams]

16:21.959 --> 16:23.333
I'll take care of Brad.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.709
You get that report card.
Get off of me!

16:25.709 --> 16:28.291
Kick, get in here
immediately!

16:28.291 --> 16:29.583
I can explain.

16:29.583 --> 16:32.333
There is no excuse for this.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.583
This water bill is 40 cents
higher than usual.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.959
Have you done
any water-related
stunts recently?

16:37.959 --> 16:38.959
Um...

16:42.500 --> 16:44.041
No.
Oh, well.

16:44.041 --> 16:46.000
Sorry about
the misunderstanding.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.041
Must be your mother and her
persistent toilet flushing.
[toilet flushes]

16:48.041 --> 16:50.000
I'll talk to her later.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.291
Now, out you go.
Gotta finish
opening this mail

16:52.291 --> 16:54.333
before the demolition derby.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.000
Now, let's see what's next.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.250
Oh, come on.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.458
Right in the middle
of mail time.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.000
Where is it?
Where is it?

17:12.125 --> 17:13.250
Ah, finally.

17:15.792 --> 17:18.375
Let's get this party started.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.041
Oh, I wish those bee
of the month club people

17:27.041 --> 17:28.417
would stop sending me
these samples.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.041
Ah! Same
for the ferret people.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.709
Oh, not another box
of piranhas.
I have enough.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.041
[grunts]

17:51.041 --> 17:54.041
Un-hunh. Un-hunh. Got it.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.166
Let me out of here!

17:58.166 --> 18:00.041
Now, let's see what's next.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.875
From the Mellowbrook
School District.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.375
Open immediately.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.166
[doorbell rings]
Special delivery.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.750
Ah! More mail.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.250
Why, thank you. I--

18:15.250 --> 18:18.583
Gunther? Where did you
get that uniform?

18:18.583 --> 18:19.667
Uh...

18:22.625 --> 18:23.750
Gotta go.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.750
Gunther, ring the doorbell.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.750
Yoink. Thanks, Kick. I was
just about to open this one.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.917
Uh...

18:34.959 --> 18:37.542
Dad, don't open that.
Why not?

18:37.542 --> 18:40.917
Uh, because I got you
a new letter opener.

18:40.917 --> 18:42.625
Ah! Let me see.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.291
I am saving it

18:44.291 --> 18:46.667
until after the derby.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.291
Tease.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.875
Ah. It's all going
according to--

18:50.875 --> 18:53.375
[gasps]
Kick!

19:02.125 --> 19:03.834
Hah, gotcha.

19:03.834 --> 19:06.291
Thanks, dillweed.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.583
Get the card, Kick.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.083
[grunts]

19:40.625 --> 19:42.333
Got it.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.208
Don't got it.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.500
[screams]

20:05.208 --> 20:06.709
Gotcha.

20:06.709 --> 20:08.458
Oh, biscuits.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.333
Got it again.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.667
I've been looking
for this. Huh?

20:18.667 --> 20:21.208
Report card? Kick, were you
trying to hide this from me?

20:21.208 --> 20:24.083
I was afraid you wouldn't
take me to the derby.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.583
But your grades have improved
across the board.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.542
Say what?

20:30.542 --> 20:34.208
<i>[Announcer] By the laws</i>
<i>of awesome, that was a crash</i>
<i>to end all crashes.</i>

20:34.208 --> 20:35.250
[crash]

20:35.250 --> 20:37.917
Holy mackerel.
Get a load of this.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.709
What happened?

20:41.709 --> 20:46.375
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was the craziest heap
of awesome I've ever seen.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.542
And look at those guys.
I think they're gonna--

20:49.542 --> 20:53.250
[crash]
What? What did I miss?

20:53.250 --> 20:56.500
Was that magic
or a bona fide derby miracle?

20:56.500 --> 20:59.250
Either way, you'll never see
that stunt again.

20:59.250 --> 21:03.959
[groans]
Well, at least I still have
my souvenir shard.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.625
Hey, is this
my new letter opener? Sweet.

21:06.625 --> 21:10.458
Biscuits.
Oh, and for messing
with my mail,

21:10.458 --> 21:11.667
you're grounded
when we get home.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.125
Now, enjoy the derby, buddy.
[crash]

21:13.125 --> 21:16.959
Biscuits with gravy.

21:20.125 --> 21:23.583
Mom? Dad?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.542
Brianna?

21:25.542 --> 21:28.709
Dillweed?
[wolf howls]

21:28.709 --> 21:30.125
Yeah, Brad.
