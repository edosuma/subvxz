00:06.100 --> 00:08.833
NARRATOR:
On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:08.867 --> 00:12.600
winter ends with a vengeance
as prep for the thaw begins.

00:12.633 --> 00:15.033
ANDY:
It's not done now, it's not
going to get done, period.

00:15.067 --> 00:18.633
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
search for their last big game
of the season.

00:18.667 --> 00:21.533
-Whoa, ho!
-NARRATOR: In Eagle,
Andy goes into overdrive

00:21.567 --> 00:23.733
to harvest essential supplies.

00:23.767 --> 00:25.367
ANDY:
This could be a real problem.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.067
NARRATOR: Sue spots trouble
in her own backyard.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I see something.

00:30.533 --> 00:34.133
NARRATOR: And Glenn is
reminded he's not the only
hunter in Chandalar.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.033
GLENN: A wolf was just here.

00:57.300 --> 01:00.800
I don't anticipate any large
predators, but you never do.

01:01.900 --> 01:04.033
So what I'm going to do today,

01:04.067 --> 01:08.633
I don't have pencil and paper,
but I do have my knife
and some snow.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.867
This is Kavik.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.567
Here's the Kavik River.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.000
Arctic Ocean is up here.

01:17.033 --> 01:22.100
Where I'm going to go,
if I go five to six miles
to the northeast,

01:22.133 --> 01:25.400
you've got several lakes.

01:25.433 --> 01:30.000
These lakes have the potential
of having some land-locked
lake trout.

01:30.033 --> 01:32.333
And that's where
I'm going to go.

01:32.367 --> 01:36.433
So, we're gonna go from Kavik
to the lake and boom.

01:36.467 --> 01:39.767
My plan is the fish are
going to be there and
I'm going to get one.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.700
I don't know
the first or last thing
about ice fishing

01:43.733 --> 01:45.167
other than people do it.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.633
But I want to learn,
and it's my nature
that if I don't know,

01:48.667 --> 01:51.533
it doesn't mean I can't do it.
I just gotta teach myself.

01:51.567 --> 01:55.367
Columbus would have never
spotted America if he hadn't
have left the harbour.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.700
NARRATOR: For Sue Aikens,
rising temperatures

02:00.733 --> 02:04.067
signal the start of the busy
season at Kavik River Camp.

02:04.100 --> 02:08.200
With clients on the way,
she has limited time
to gather fresh food.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.167
SUE: It's like being the only
kid in a really cool sandbox.
You know?

02:16.200 --> 02:20.400
I get to build sandcastles
all over the place.
It's my big backyard.

02:33.700 --> 02:34.733
I am thinking

02:35.967 --> 02:38.000
this looks like a fishy spot.

02:40.133 --> 02:41.267
I think

02:45.233 --> 02:46.733
X marks the spot.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.533
Yeah, I mean
I've never used this auger,

02:51.567 --> 02:53.767
so I'm going to
put it together

02:53.800 --> 02:55.400
and try it.

02:55.433 --> 02:56.467
You fucking whore.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.267
You know, it's something
I haven't done yet,

02:58.300 --> 03:00.400
so see if I can't dig
a few holes.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.533
Got it primed.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.233
On.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.900
That's as deep
as this is going to go.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.133
I don't see any water.

03:30.267 --> 03:34.133
So maybe I'll try
a little further out.

03:34.167 --> 03:36.733
Maybe this is just
too close to the shore.

03:45.067 --> 03:48.467
Well, I didn't hit water,
but I did hit dirt.

03:51.567 --> 03:52.933
I don't see any water.

04:10.433 --> 04:13.200
Well, that's it. I still can't
get past the ice.

04:13.933 --> 04:15.967
All these holes I dug.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.600
I mean, you've got
four foot you can go down,

04:19.633 --> 04:22.433
and I'm not hitting water.
I'm staying on ice.

04:22.467 --> 04:25.833
Hit dirt over there,
just not pay dirt.

04:25.867 --> 04:28.200
It ain't over
until the fat lady sings,

04:28.233 --> 04:30.167
and I'm just chunky
and can't carry a tune.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.800
CHIP:
Subsistence to me
is getting nutritious food

04:35.833 --> 04:38.133
and the chase
that it involves to get it.

04:39.467 --> 04:40.933
It's healthy,
it's all healthy.

04:40.967 --> 04:42.833
Then there's
a great reward for it.

04:58.133 --> 05:00.567
I'm covering my lights up
with a piece of cardboard.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.267
I do this so that the animals
don't see us coming.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.800
We're not like
flashing a flashlight at them,
getting their attention.

05:07.967 --> 05:09.700
NARRATOR:
For Chip and Agnes Hailstone,

05:09.733 --> 05:13.333
the end of winter is
the final chance to harvest
big game before the thaw.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.933
They have set up a temporary
camp in Kiwalik,

05:16.967 --> 05:19.400
85 miles south of their home
in Noorvik,

05:19.433 --> 05:23.467
in hopes of intercepting
a herd of caribou.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.933
CHIP: The importance of coming
out here at this time of year
and doing these kind of hunts

05:26.967 --> 05:29.033
is this time of year
is when the females are fat.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.267
But these ones have been
grazing in the dark winter.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.033
That's important on
a high protein diet like
we have.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.500
So, we come up here
and this is kind of our
last chance at fat caribou.

05:37.533 --> 05:41.933
We're not going to see
fat caribou again until
probably August.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.300
Maybe 100 of them
spread over the side
of the hill here.

05:45.333 --> 05:50.100
I just don't see
a way of getting to them,
or sneaking on them.

05:50.133 --> 05:52.267
CHIP: Let's see
how many females there are.

05:52.300 --> 05:57.200
There's caribou
scattered all along that hill.

05:57.233 --> 06:00.700
I thought there was 100.
There's probably 300, 400.

06:00.733 --> 06:03.600
We're going to have to
do some, uh, sneaking.

06:03.633 --> 06:06.233
Where's my white mask?

06:06.267 --> 06:09.167
AGNES:
Nice day for a good hunt.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.767
We just got to keep quiet
and keep calm,

06:11.800 --> 06:17.067
and hopefully they'll get
100, 150 yards away
or something.

06:18.033 --> 06:19.633
(CHIP AND AGNES SPEAKING)

06:28.200 --> 06:30.400
(CHIP AND AGNES SPEAKING)

06:30.433 --> 06:32.400
Yup. Those two.
They busted ass.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.233
It's just too wide open
for us here.

06:35.267 --> 06:37.967
We need to have something
to put between us and them
for a while.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.067
You know what I mean?
These are what we call
educated animals.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.767
They just know
what a snow machine is.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.700
They know what a person is,
and they're pretty leery.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.033
(AGNES SPEAKING)

06:49.167 --> 06:51.000
CHIP: We don't want to
press them too hard.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.700
The sun's going down.

06:52.733 --> 06:57.933
If we piss them off or make
them scared, tomorrow won't
be so productive.

06:57.967 --> 07:01.633
See how they stopped. They go
about 400 yards and they stop,
start grazing again.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.167
No matter what we do
as we approach them,

07:03.200 --> 07:06.367
they're just going to keep
staying out of our reach.
(LAUGHS)

07:06.400 --> 07:08.300
They got us busted
on this open ground.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.200
But it's getting really late
in the day.

07:10.233 --> 07:13.600
And what we wanted to do today
was basically scout and locate
these animals.

07:13.633 --> 07:18.133
Now we've got them located.
We can formulate a plan,
and this has just begun.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.800
GLENN:
I operate on my own out here.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.833
Really that's part of
the appeal of being here,

07:23.867 --> 07:25.833
is the independence
and the freedom

07:25.867 --> 07:30.000
of not to be tethered
to a safety line all the time.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.600
Out here snowshoes
are an essential piece
of equipment

07:47.633 --> 07:49.633
because the snow
gets very deep,

07:49.667 --> 07:51.200
it's unconsolidated.

07:51.233 --> 07:54.633
It stays so cold here
that it seldom gets a crust
down in the forest

07:54.667 --> 07:57.300
although it will get windblown
in places.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.000
And without snowshoes,
I just can't get around.

08:02.300 --> 08:06.133
Getting these snowshoes
fixed up in order to go out
and make some trails.

08:06.167 --> 08:09.533
Because I don't use machinery
to travel,

08:09.567 --> 08:13.133
I only walk to get around
in the winter.

08:13.167 --> 08:18.033
My hunting territory is
very small compared to
people who use machines.

08:18.067 --> 08:20.167
And I like the traditional
wooden snowshoe.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.667
They're quieter.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.733
You just have two pieces
of metal banging together

08:23.767 --> 08:26.567
once when you're
stalking a caribou,
it could be all over.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.033
When you're sneaking up
on game, you just can't have
any sound like that.

08:32.333 --> 08:36.433
Today I'm going to build
a trail up this mountain on
the north side of my valley.

08:36.467 --> 08:40.967
The mountain's about
1,200 feet above the elevation
of the lake.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.933
By travelling on the trails,

08:43.967 --> 08:48.633
I can see what's going on
with the animals I hunt
in order to get my food.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.667
And the trails allow me

08:50.700 --> 08:54.067
to keep track of
the movements of the animals
and to intercept them.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.500
The first time up
is always difficult

08:57.533 --> 09:01.767
and it gets easier
once I have a trail in.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.867
But where it's steep
like this,

09:03.900 --> 09:05.733
it's not easy going.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.167
I see a very faint track here
in the snow,

09:13.200 --> 09:15.167
and even though
it's very faint,

09:15.200 --> 09:18.167
I can tell that that's
a ptarmigan for sure.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.533
The reason I'm building
this trail here

09:20.567 --> 09:23.867
is in order to collect
information about what's going
on all around the valley.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.233
And I'm mostly
looking at tracks.

09:26.267 --> 09:29.833
It's very unlikely I'm going
to run into the animal right
here that I'm looking for.

09:29.867 --> 09:34.067
But I get all kinds of
information from the tracks
I see.

09:34.100 --> 09:39.567
That's the purpose of
this trail more than anything
is to gather information.

09:39.600 --> 09:43.033
It's getting so steep here,
that I'm going to take
my snowshoes off

09:43.067 --> 09:44.800
and just kind of swim through
this snow

09:44.833 --> 09:47.933
because I'm sliding back
as much as I'm moving forward.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.733
It's so steep in here,
and the ground's so rough
in this area,

09:53.767 --> 09:56.067
that it's easier for me to go
without the snowshoes.

10:10.100 --> 10:14.200
I got my trail from camp up
to the ridge here on the north
side of my valley

10:14.233 --> 10:18.267
and tomorrow I'm planning
to head to the top of the
mountain on the south side.

10:18.300 --> 10:22.067
What a beautiful evening.
What a great way to spend it
too up here.

10:23.467 --> 10:25.333
ANDY: There's always two sides
to everything out here.

10:25.367 --> 10:28.000
There's trying to
make life easy for yourself.

10:28.033 --> 10:31.267
And then there's surviving
if something really bad
goes wrong.

10:31.300 --> 10:35.467
And often times,
the same obstacle provides
both to you.

10:44.767 --> 10:46.400
Ooh, boy.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.400
Another calm day on the Yukon.
(LAUGHS)

10:51.433 --> 10:55.500
So I'm going to need
more logs for building
the new generator shack.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.367
-Yeah.
-And my trail's going out.

10:57.400 --> 11:02.000
I mean, look at it. I'm down
to dirt right here. You know
things are melting. So

11:02.033 --> 11:06.233
that's kind of like the most
essential thing for me to do
right now timing-wise.

11:06.267 --> 11:09.067
'Cause once I don't...
Once I can't run
this trail any more,

11:09.100 --> 11:12.267
-I'm screwed for logging
for the rest of the year.
-Well...

11:13.233 --> 11:14.467
I'd say get cracking.

11:18.367 --> 11:22.100
I'm really battling the clock
right now.

11:22.133 --> 11:24.167
Every year is a different year
with the weather.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.900
Climate change is really
affecting our seasons.

11:26.933 --> 11:30.367
I probably only got about
another four or five days to
get these logs in,

11:30.400 --> 11:34.200
or that's it. I won't
be able to do it, so...

11:34.233 --> 11:36.767
I'm really nervous
about the break-up.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.933
Every year break-up happens.
It's a crapshoot for us.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.767
We have no idea
what's going to happen here.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.933
It's adapting. Every year
is adapting, changing.

11:45.967 --> 11:48.000
I'd rather be doing
other things right now.

11:48.033 --> 11:52.300
I'd love to be out
running my dogs, but it's time
to get these logs in, and

11:52.333 --> 11:55.300
if it's not done now,
it's not going to
get done, period.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.633
Burning daylight. (LAUGHING)

11:57.667 --> 11:59.633
Time to go get some logs.

12:06.067 --> 12:08.133
I'm having to log
in a new area
this year

12:08.167 --> 12:11.533
because the river never
froze up in front of
our place here,

12:11.567 --> 12:16.800
and as a result I'm having to
go a little more than twice
as far than I normally do.

12:16.833 --> 12:20.900
My trails are getting
pretty weak now.
They're running out of snow.

12:20.933 --> 12:22.833
I don't have too much
more time.

12:26.033 --> 12:29.533
Got a couple of good trees
right in this area that
I can get.

12:31.567 --> 12:36.200
First step, I like getting
a rope on these trees when
I'm logging by myself.

12:36.233 --> 12:41.433
A lot of these trees are
too small in diameter to use
as a wedge.

12:41.467 --> 12:44.867
And when you're finishing up
your cut,

12:44.900 --> 12:47.100
if the wind blows
the wrong way,

12:47.133 --> 12:51.000
your tree falls back.
So this kind of acts like
a safety for me.

12:51.033 --> 12:54.933
One of the dangers of
falling trees out here
is hang-ups,

12:54.967 --> 12:58.567
when they hang up on
another tree when they
start to fall.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.900
That can be a really
dangerous situation.

13:00.933 --> 13:04.267
When they're hung up in trees,
you really never know exactly
what they're going to do.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.467
Sometimes they break off
the top of the other tree.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.833
They flip around, they twist.

13:08.867 --> 13:12.067
So I have to be
really cautious about
what I'm doing here

13:12.100 --> 13:14.167
'cause one slip-up here,

13:14.200 --> 13:16.533
that could screw up
the rest of my year.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.700
Could end it completely
for me.

13:39.467 --> 13:40.867
Aw, shit.

13:42.267 --> 13:44.133
She's hung up.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.900
This could be a real problem.

13:45.933 --> 13:49.233
When they get hung up like
this, I don't know where this
things going to go right now.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.233
When it goes,
it might kick back.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.100
It's cut completely free.

13:55.133 --> 13:59.033
So, what I need right now
is a big gust of wind

13:59.067 --> 14:01.533
(CHUCKLES)
to help me get this down.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.500
But I could start pulling on
that rope,

14:03.533 --> 14:06.200
and hopefully this baby
will come down where
I want her.

14:06.233 --> 14:10.700
But you never know
where she's going to go
when they're like this.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.300
All right, see if she goes.

14:24.633 --> 14:26.067
There she goes.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.133
Timber!

14:30.833 --> 14:32.267
All right.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.267
Thank you, wind.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.500
Cut some trees.

14:48.467 --> 14:53.500
Well, what I'm doing right now
is cutting small cabin logs,
eight-foot sections.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.067
So this tree basically did
one round.

14:56.100 --> 14:59.867
I figure I need probably
somewhere around
10 to 15 rounds,

14:59.900 --> 15:01.800
so 10 or 15 trees.

15:01.833 --> 15:05.567
All right, looks like
a load to me.

15:11.033 --> 15:13.167
I am very comfortable
operating out here alone,

15:13.200 --> 15:14.767
but there are
certain risks involved.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.500
And the thing foremost
in my mind

15:17.533 --> 15:20.167
is that I need to be able to
get home on my own two legs

15:20.200 --> 15:23.767
because nobody's going to
come looking for me
if I don't.

15:28.667 --> 15:32.467
Okay, I've got a bone here
I'm going to break.

15:33.567 --> 15:35.367
NARRATOR:
Over the course of winter,

15:35.400 --> 15:39.633
Glenn covers hundreds
of miles of extreme terrain
in search of game.

15:39.667 --> 15:43.433
A high fat diet is crucial
for his body to keep up.

15:43.467 --> 15:47.200
GLENN:
This is the lower right leg
from a young bull moose,

15:47.233 --> 15:51.867
15 or 16 months old,
and I'm going to break it
to get the marrow out.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.567
Of course you can use a saw
to get to the marrow.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.933
But I found that by supporting
the bone between two
large rocks

15:57.967 --> 16:00.833
and dropping
a third rock on
the centre of the bone,

16:00.867 --> 16:02.967
that that worked
most efficiently for me.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.033
So that's the technique
I'm using.

16:05.067 --> 16:07.833
I just position these
two rocks here on the ice

16:07.867 --> 16:12.600
so that the bone is supported
between the rocks.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.567
So, what I was looking for
is the marrow.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.967
This right here.
This is the good stuff.

16:33.333 --> 16:34.900
Mmm.

16:34.933 --> 16:38.433
That is right out of
the middle of that tibia,

16:39.600 --> 16:41.300
and it's very tasty.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.467
There's a lot more in there.

16:45.233 --> 16:46.500
Look at this.

16:46.533 --> 16:50.433
Yeah, like all that's
good marrow right in there.

16:54.967 --> 16:57.167
It's very high in fat.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.767
Fat's the main thing
around here.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.533
It's hungry country,
it's the Arctic.

17:02.567 --> 17:06.167
At this time of year now,
you know, a lot of animals
don't have much fat.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.833
I mean, I eat about
a half a pound of fat a day,

17:08.867 --> 17:11.400
and if I didn't eat
that much fat,

17:11.433 --> 17:14.933
I wouldn't be able to
eat enough food because
you can only eat so much meat.

17:14.967 --> 17:18.767
You actually get poisoned
by too much protein,
but you can eat a lot of fat.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.967
You have to get
about 70, 75% of
your calories from fat

17:22.000 --> 17:23.467
if you don't have
carbohydrates.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.133
What a day.

17:27.933 --> 17:29.100
I love it.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.467
This is eating out
in the Brooks Range.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.833
Fast food.

17:35.867 --> 17:39.900
Smash something with a couple
of rocks and it's ready to go.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.533
We're not harvesting anything.

17:43.567 --> 17:45.867
This isn't wheat that waits
for us to chop it down.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.567
We're hunters.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.700
We're chasing these animals
down, and we're catching them,
and taking their lives.

17:50.733 --> 17:53.533
And then we're eating them,
and they're letting us live.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.133
CHIP: I don't think
they're far.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.667
I think our biggest problem
is gonna be wind today.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.967
We're getting about a
10-mile-an-hour wind, and I
can see windy clouds up top.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.100
So, we'll see what we see.
We'll see what the weather
brings us.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.767
NARRATOR:
Chip and Agnes Hailstone

18:15.800 --> 18:19.600
are set to begin
the second day of their final
caribou hunt of the season.

18:19.633 --> 18:24.167
It is their last chance
to provide their family with
caribou meat until summer.

18:28.067 --> 18:31.467
In the system up here we have,
once I've gotten enough meat
for myself,

18:31.500 --> 18:33.533
I take the other meats that
I've got and I trade them.

18:33.567 --> 18:36.033
It's legal here to barter
for caribou.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.533
It's like basically making
your own money.

18:37.567 --> 18:39.600
It's kind of like digging gold
out of the ground.

18:39.633 --> 18:41.933
It's something that you're
the first one to get
a hold of it,

18:41.967 --> 18:43.900
and you just go from there.

18:43.933 --> 18:45.633
Meat is our money.

18:48.633 --> 18:51.833
-Just on top of the hill.
-There's quite a few.

18:51.867 --> 18:52.900
CHIP: Huh?
AGNES: Caribou?

18:52.933 --> 18:54.067
CHIP: Yeah, caribou up there.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.200
We got lots of caribou around
us and we just got here.

18:57.233 --> 18:58.700
So we don't want to
spook them up,

18:58.733 --> 19:00.767
but what we want to do is
creep around the top
of the hill

19:00.800 --> 19:03.167
and have a look over here.
And we know that there's
a lot of caribou

19:03.200 --> 19:05.100
on the other side of the hill
that are coming over.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.833
So we're gonna go get up
on top and wait for them
to come to us.

19:11.167 --> 19:12.467

19:18.933 --> 19:20.367

AGNES: Argh, they're still...

19:24.933 --> 19:27.500
CHIP: I didn't see a hit.
AGNES: I didn't see it either.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.400
Shoot when you feel like it.

19:32.433 --> 19:33.933
AGNES: Argh, right between.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.367
CHIP:
Pretty hard with this wind.
AGNES: It's the wind.

19:37.867 --> 19:38.933
Nope.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.300
In front of it.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.467
We'll just get ready
for the next time.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.333
They never stay
in the same place.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.533
They're fucking
caribou, right?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.933
Caribou do what caribou do.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.700
AGNES: Whoo!
CHIP: Oh, yeah!

20:26.733 --> 20:27.833
Got one down.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.100
I know you nailed it
at least once.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.933
Maybe you hit it twice.
I don't know.

20:30.967 --> 20:33.367
-I hit it once, and it...
-We'll find out when
we get there.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.033
Yeah. I finally got my shot.

20:36.067 --> 20:39.933
It took me like a few shots
to figure out the wind,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.233
-and the distance.
-It's all right.

20:42.267 --> 20:43.767
That's what it takes.
It takes a few shots.

20:43.800 --> 20:47.967
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Hey. Very few people
would shoot in this wind.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.200
-(LAUGHS)
-And just...

20:49.233 --> 20:50.833
-Good shot?
-Yeah.

20:50.867 --> 20:52.867
-Good enough?
-Good enough.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.367
-I'll go down there,
and go cut its throat.
-Okay.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.933
This took quite many miles,

21:00.967 --> 21:05.633
but when we came
across this herd it was
to my advantage.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.900
It was downhill,
and the wind was in my favour,

21:08.933 --> 21:14.267
and we have one down now
to skin and butcher.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.667
CHIP: Oh yeah.
Look how fat she is.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.400
Yee! I was waiting
till you opened it up. Wow!

21:19.433 --> 21:20.933
Good choice one I did.

21:20.967 --> 21:22.467
-Yup.
-Wee!

21:22.500 --> 21:24.600
-Oh, wow.
-Ah... Oh, this is
a real prize.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.133
Well, today has gone
pretty good.

21:26.167 --> 21:28.333
Scoring this first one,
you know, it kind of
takes that

21:28.367 --> 21:30.033
"are we gonna get it" off.

21:30.067 --> 21:33.033
We've already got success,
so no matter how we
return home,

21:33.067 --> 21:34.400
we'll return home successful.

21:34.433 --> 21:36.900
Our plan though is to
return home quite successful

21:36.933 --> 21:40.033
to make all of our endeavour,
and our money, and our
investment

21:40.067 --> 21:43.700
in, uh, into caribou.
(CHUCKLES)

21:43.733 --> 21:44.933
So what we'd like to do is
fill up the sled

21:44.967 --> 21:47.633
and bring home more caribou
than what we've got right now.

21:47.667 --> 21:50.267
If we wanted just one,
we would go home
and go to bed.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.300
We would be done.
But we're not single caribou
kind of people.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.767
SUE: You know, I don't see
myself as a great huntress.

22:02.800 --> 22:07.767
I don't see myself
as a great proprietress.

22:07.800 --> 22:12.400
What I see myself as
is an explorer.

22:19.633 --> 22:23.467
NARRATOR: Sue has spent
half the day drilling through
six feet of ice for fish,

22:23.500 --> 22:26.033
and so far
she's come up empty.

22:26.067 --> 22:28.433
I did find the lake.
I did drill holes.

22:28.467 --> 22:31.300
It was a bust.
That's the way it goes.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.700
Disappointing, maybe,
but I'm not gonna ruin
a brand new piece of equipment

22:36.733 --> 22:39.800
trying to...
I'm not going for rock fish.

22:39.833 --> 22:42.267
I wanted, you know, water.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.667
So fins win today.

22:46.167 --> 22:50.233
But I'll follow the river,
take it home, see what I find.

22:52.733 --> 22:54.733
(SUE SPEAKING)

23:11.167 --> 23:13.267
Wolverine track.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.267
So this might be what
I'm going towards,

23:15.300 --> 23:19.467
and lucky me,
alls I got is the .44,
which is close range.

23:19.500 --> 23:23.333
But these are wolverine
tracks, and it's headed
right where I'm headed.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.733
So, we'll see.

23:28.767 --> 23:31.833
.44 is not
the weapon of choice
with a wolverine.

23:31.867 --> 23:33.400
Not unless he's in a trap.

23:33.433 --> 23:35.600
It's not meant
for long distances.

23:38.100 --> 23:42.167
The wolverine is definitely
one of the predators awake
this time of year.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.567
Saw fresh tracks, so I'll just
keep my eyes peeled.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:03.167 --> 24:04.967
I see something.

24:07.667 --> 24:12.000
Okay. I see something
real dark over this way.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.700
Sticks out like a sore thumb.

24:13.733 --> 24:16.267
I got a little bit
of an optical illusion.

24:16.300 --> 24:19.800
The sun hitting the snow
is causing a wave that's
stretching things,

24:22.333 --> 24:27.400
but it's definitely
a real dark colour on
a real white background.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.500
I say we get a little closer.
See what we got.

24:48.300 --> 24:52.433
Okay. Just stop, see
if I can pick it up again.

24:52.467 --> 24:53.633
There it is.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.733
Okay I see something real dark
over this way.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.900
Sticks out like a sore thumb.

25:03.933 --> 25:06.700
Boy, there's no telling
because it's being stretched.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.400
It's still there.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.433
And they are foxes.

25:17.467 --> 25:19.267
And they are running away.
They're saying,

25:19.300 --> 25:23.633
"See you later alligator.
You scared the hell
out of me. Goodbye."

25:25.600 --> 25:27.933
All right. Yo.

25:28.933 --> 25:31.233
Foxes are friends, not fur.

25:31.267 --> 25:33.833
You know, I don't wanna make
a coat out of them.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.233
I don't want to sell them
for money.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.833
I don't wanna know that I can
get 100 or 200 bucks
for a fox.

25:38.867 --> 25:42.467
What I get out of that fox is
worth far more than money.

25:42.500 --> 25:46.000
I have companionship and
I have the experience
of a lifetime.

26:11.267 --> 26:14.467
Well. I know I got
a couple of birds.

26:14.500 --> 26:18.433
Sue's plan was to
try ice fishing and, uh,

26:18.467 --> 26:20.900
the tundra provided
another meal.

26:20.933 --> 26:23.300
Living out here, you know,
you're like any predator.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.000
You're an opportunist if
you're gonna be successful,

26:27.633 --> 26:30.133
and ended up getting myself
a ptarmigan.

26:30.900 --> 26:31.900

26:32.733 --> 26:34.667
Yay! (LAUGHS)

28:05.733 --> 28:08.033
(CHIP SPEAKING)

28:09.800 --> 28:12.700
-Oh, wicked.
-(AGNES LAUGHS)

28:12.733 --> 28:14.533
(AGNES AND CHIP SPEAKING)

28:17.533 --> 28:19.033
Okay. That's good.

28:19.067 --> 28:21.133
They're down anyway,
let's go finish them off.

28:21.167 --> 28:24.000
-Just relax, relax, relax.
-Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

28:24.033 --> 28:25.867
Most of the hard shit is done.

28:31.367 --> 28:32.567
AGNES: Yee!

28:33.667 --> 28:34.867
CHIP: Whoa.

28:40.467 --> 28:43.233
Oh... Well,
that one just dropped.

28:43.267 --> 28:45.333
I like your shooting.

28:45.367 --> 28:47.000
It's hard to shoot
in a wind like this,

28:47.033 --> 28:49.700
but once you got it
dialled in, that's the
way to go.

28:49.733 --> 28:53.300
These will go quite nice with
the caribou we got yesterday.

28:53.333 --> 28:55.300
This will carry us through
till the spring.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.800
It won't be till August that
we get fat caribou again,

28:57.833 --> 29:01.200
but I think we'll be
plenty happy with these.

29:01.233 --> 29:05.567
Yep. This is a lot of work
all right, but it's work
I enjoy

29:05.600 --> 29:08.733
and this is a job well done
for us today

29:08.767 --> 29:12.067
and just a day closer to home.

29:14.267 --> 29:17.467
GLENN:
People are becoming separated
from nature more and more.

29:17.500 --> 29:21.233
But the way of nature is
for life to consume life.

29:21.267 --> 29:24.200
It's a continuous cycle
that happens every day here.

29:24.967 --> 29:26.900
And I'm part of that cycle.

29:36.433 --> 29:39.900
It's possible to judge the
temperature very accurately

29:39.933 --> 29:42.500
by the sound of the breath
freezing when you exhale.

29:42.533 --> 29:45.667
And at 40 below zero, I can
just barely start to hear it.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.933
I can just barely hear
my breath freezing now.

29:48.967 --> 29:50.267
NARRATOR:
For Glenn Villeneuve,

29:50.300 --> 29:53.500
a hunting trail is imperative
for food and survival.

29:53.533 --> 29:56.067
Yesterday, he broke
the first half of his trail

29:56.100 --> 30:00.167
but today will be
a more difficult climb.

30:00.200 --> 30:05.000
So my plan is to snowshoe
across the valley and then
go up this ridge

30:05.033 --> 30:08.700
to the skyline there and then
back further to the top of
a mountain.

30:08.733 --> 30:14.333
It's probably a total of about
four miles walk from here
to the top.

30:14.367 --> 30:18.667
And about 3,000 feet
in elevation gain.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.367
Hopefully, I'll get up
to the top today and
have my trail finished.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.067
About six miles across
the valley here.

30:32.967 --> 30:37.233
One hazard of the extreme cold
weather when you're working
very hard physically

30:37.267 --> 30:39.267
is getting frostbite.

30:39.300 --> 30:42.100
Any exposed skin,
like on the face or fingers

30:42.133 --> 30:45.967
when I have to use my fingers
for dexterity and take
my mittens off.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.200
I can only do that for so long
and then I will get frostbite.

30:50.233 --> 30:53.000
That's one of my biggest
concerns about the cold.

30:59.767 --> 31:03.500
I've travelled more than
half a mile from camp

31:03.533 --> 31:08.167
and I haven't really
seen any fresh tracks,
which is not unusual.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.467
It's really hungry country
out here.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.933
It's feast or famine.

31:11.967 --> 31:15.000
There's times of abundance,
and there's times of scarcity.

31:15.033 --> 31:18.100
Right now's a time of scarcity
right here in this
particular area.

31:29.267 --> 31:31.267
The snow down in the forest
is pretty deep

31:31.300 --> 31:34.933
and walking on snowshoes,
I got a really good trail
in there.

31:34.967 --> 31:37.967
Now I'm up above the trees
where the snow is wind-blown,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.900
and in places
it will still be deep.

31:39.933 --> 31:42.600
I think I wanna leave
my snowshoes on
a little while longer.

31:45.900 --> 31:49.067
The snow's all windblown.
There's some ptarmigan tracks.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.967
The wind blows a lot more
than it does down
in the forest

31:52.000 --> 31:54.467
and it blows a lot of the snow
right off the ground.

31:54.500 --> 31:57.167
What's left gets windblown
and hard packed.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.533
It's much easier and faster
to walk on.

32:00.967 --> 32:03.000
You can really
make time up here.

32:06.667 --> 32:09.800
Wow. A wolf was just here.

32:10.367 --> 32:11.633
Wolves.

32:11.667 --> 32:14.233
There's been a pack of wolves
walking around here.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.100
I'm not the only one out here
hunting today.

32:22.133 --> 32:24.233
That's a fresh wolf track
right there.

32:24.267 --> 32:25.900
The wolves are hunting
the mountains too.

32:25.933 --> 32:29.267
Wind blows up here and
tracks don't last too long
without changing.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.733
These look really fresh.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.167
I'm gonna follow these tracks
and see where they lead.

32:40.267 --> 32:42.533
You know, the wolves have
a really good nose

32:42.567 --> 32:45.633
and there's times when there
are not many caribou around.

32:45.667 --> 32:49.367
I might not be able to
find one, but the wolves do
sometimes lead me to them.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.167
So if the wolves are finding
something to eat up on
these mountains,

32:52.200 --> 32:53.633
then there's a chance
I will too.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.733
There's a wolf track
right there headed that way.

32:55.767 --> 32:57.900
He's headed right toward
the top of the mountain.

32:59.867 --> 33:02.067
(SIGHS)
That's the way I'm going too.

33:05.933 --> 33:09.300
See, I travel from the valley
up to the ridge top to see

33:09.333 --> 33:13.800
what's going on because that's
where a lot of the action
takes place in the winter.

33:13.833 --> 33:17.733
I've gotten meat from wolves
when they've killed caribou
just in front of me.

33:17.767 --> 33:22.067
Usually the wolves, they don't
want anything to do with me.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.333
-They know I'm dangerous.
-(WOLVES HOWLING)

33:24.367 --> 33:26.433
The wolves always backed down.

33:26.467 --> 33:30.333
Until last year one time
there was this big pack
of 20 wolves,

33:30.367 --> 33:31.533
and I was approaching them.

33:31.567 --> 33:33.467
They had just killed a moose

33:33.500 --> 33:36.667
and those wolves
actually ran after me

33:36.700 --> 33:38.767
and I ended up
shooting three of them.

33:42.067 --> 33:46.400
We are on the top
of the mountain.
This is the end of my route.

33:46.433 --> 33:50.467
There's some tracks down there
but they might have passed
there a few days ago.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.800
If I saw a caribou there,
that would be
a different story.

33:52.833 --> 33:56.333
What interests me is just that
there are wolves out here

33:57.033 --> 33:59.633
and there are caribou around.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.733
Small numbers.

34:01.767 --> 34:05.767
And more very well may be
coming in the coming weeks.

34:05.800 --> 34:10.100
I just have to be patient
and wait for an opportunity.

34:12.333 --> 34:15.233
That ridge top there,
that's where I was yesterday.

34:15.267 --> 34:17.700
It's about a six-mile route
that I've got now

34:17.733 --> 34:20.600
from the top of that ridge to
the top of this one up here.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.667
It's just good
to be back out here.

34:24.700 --> 34:31.633
This is the place that I feel
most comfortable at
and most at home at.

34:31.667 --> 34:36.600
I feel like the lifestyle
out here affords you
much more freedom

34:36.633 --> 34:39.133
than lifestyle in
modern America does.

34:39.167 --> 34:41.333
I don't like other people
deciding what I do.

34:41.367 --> 34:43.833
I'd rather follow
the dictates of nature.

34:45.733 --> 34:47.867
This lake right here

34:48.533 --> 34:49.933
is home.

34:52.767 --> 34:55.367
CHIP: Noorvik is
a large family basically,

34:55.400 --> 34:58.367
and there's a large sense of
community there where people
take care of each other.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.567
It's a really good social
system among hunters.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.367
It's 'cause we like to keep
what we must and share
what we can.

35:19.133 --> 35:21.167
CHIP: Pretty bright, nice day.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.767
-Wow.
-Whew.

35:24.800 --> 35:28.133
We'll just get these caribou
off here and start skinning.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.267
We got five nice caribou.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.967
Five nice females, real fat.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.300
AGNES: Yee!

35:39.800 --> 35:41.900
CHIP:
We saved the skinning for
today for a couple reasons.

35:41.933 --> 35:44.133
Number one, it's because
we were so tired last night.

35:44.167 --> 35:46.400
Number two is because
it holds the heat in the meat

35:46.433 --> 35:48.800
and the meat goes through
rigor mortis and then
it relaxes

35:48.833 --> 35:50.800
and it's a much softer
and a better grade of meat.

35:50.833 --> 35:53.867
These are March females
and they're really fat.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.933
And that's the reason
why we're specifically
after these kind

35:55.967 --> 35:57.567
before the end of March
is over

35:57.600 --> 36:00.833
so this is like our last
chance at getting fat caribou
meat until August.

36:00.867 --> 36:05.633
If we want to have any more
really good, fat caribou for
ourselves and our kids,

36:05.667 --> 36:07.367
this is the time to do it.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.867
AGNES: I enjoy doing
this work out here.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.500
It's kind of nice.
It's a nice day.

36:14.533 --> 36:16.700
I'm pretty satisfied
with our catch.

36:16.733 --> 36:18.867
We're off to a good start.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.767
Spring's coming on
pretty quick here.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.567
This winter isn't gonna
hold on too long.

36:25.033 --> 36:27.533
CHIP: We've had
a pretty good winter.
We've done well with fur.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.167
Next to the other one.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.233
Perfect, babe.

36:30.267 --> 36:31.867
We've done well with fishing.

36:31.900 --> 36:34.933
-One, and it have eggs!
-Full of eggs!

36:34.967 --> 36:36.733
CHIP: We were lucky
to get what we got.

36:38.433 --> 36:41.467
I like the partnership we have
when we do this kind
of hunting.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.533
It's the same thing when
we're hunting for predators.

36:43.567 --> 36:46.233
My wife is the eyeballs,
and I'm a driving.

36:51.733 --> 36:54.400
-That's a taste, huh?
-Yep. Fresh.

36:54.433 --> 36:58.667
CHIP: Now this is a way
to end a nice, fat female
caribou hunt

36:58.700 --> 37:00.567
before we're on
to the next thing.

37:02.167 --> 37:03.633
ANDY: Every day is different.

37:03.667 --> 37:05.700
Every week is different here.

37:05.733 --> 37:07.933
Walk 200 yards
down to the river

37:07.967 --> 37:11.067
and it's a very different
place than it was
the week before.

37:23.833 --> 37:26.767
NARRATOR:
Andy's managed to gather
a sizable load of timber,

37:26.800 --> 37:28.567
but getting it back to
his homestead

37:28.600 --> 37:32.567
will require navigating
a narrow trail through
the dense forest.

37:32.600 --> 37:36.000
These are 18-footers.
This is gonna be a lot
squirrelier going back.

37:36.033 --> 37:40.967
Uh, back end's gonna wanna
slew around and it's gonna
wanna fall off the trail.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.833
It's a lot of weight.
Anytime you have weight,

37:43.867 --> 37:45.267
you got issues.

37:46.033 --> 37:48.700
If it falls off the trail,

37:48.733 --> 37:50.367
yeah, I don't know
what I'll do.

37:51.333 --> 37:53.333
I'm a little concerned
about that.

37:53.367 --> 37:55.767
All right. All loaded up.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.600
Last load of the day.

37:58.633 --> 38:00.600
It's getting late.
I'm getting tired.

38:00.633 --> 38:02.933
I'm thirsty.
My back's getting sore.

38:02.967 --> 38:05.933
Time to get this load home
and into the pile.

38:17.333 --> 38:19.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, easy.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.733
Slow down, slow down.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.200
Son of a bitch.
That was close.

38:44.467 --> 38:46.867
Don't you dare
fall off of there.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.467
What I've always noticed,
I don't know if it's 'cause
it's the end of the day

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
or it's just the way
things are around here,

39:15.533 --> 39:19.867
but it's always the last
100 yards to the house
that seems to be the killer.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.033
You know, I have a lot of
problems coming up
my ramp around here

39:23.067 --> 39:25.600
'cause of the dirt,
and the mud, and
the steep hill.

39:25.633 --> 39:27.467
Once that sled falls off
one time,

39:27.500 --> 39:30.833
it creates a rut and
then it always wants to go
into that rut.

39:30.867 --> 39:32.233
It never fails.

39:32.267 --> 39:33.933
Anyway, good day logging.

39:33.967 --> 39:37.200
Uh, didn't get hurt.

39:37.233 --> 39:39.833
I'm making progress
but I got a lot to do.

39:42.733 --> 39:46.100
Yeah, I think we...
I think we should just finish
building our cabin

39:46.133 --> 39:49.067
and then we can be like just

39:49.100 --> 39:53.200
big, fat beer bellies, and

39:53.233 --> 39:57.367
we can sit around and complain
about all of our aches and
pains and...

39:57.400 --> 40:01.167
-I look forward to that day.
-Me too. (CHUCKLES)

40:01.200 --> 40:03.233
You know, everything
that I do out here is

40:03.267 --> 40:05.267
something I get jazzed about,

40:05.300 --> 40:10.433
whether it's hunting meat,
putting fish up, milling wood,
running the dogs.

40:10.467 --> 40:14.000
Every time I do something,
it reaffirms that I'm doing
the right thing

40:14.033 --> 40:16.567
living out here
the way I live. For me.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.633
I'm glad I listened to
my heart when I was
a 20-year-old kid

40:19.667 --> 40:21.667
and decided to come out here

40:21.700 --> 40:24.233
and make a life for myself
out here.

40:24.267 --> 40:27.167
'Cause it's, it's been a,
been a good ride you know?

40:27.200 --> 40:30.300
KATE:
We've learned how to survive
and we've learned very well.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.733
And we're proud of it,

40:31.767 --> 40:34.700
and we want to keep on
doing it until

40:34.733 --> 40:36.767
our bodies say otherwise,

40:36.800 --> 40:39.800
our souls drift off
down the river.

40:39.833 --> 40:41.900
So here's to springtime, babe.

40:41.933 --> 40:43.800
-(GLASSES CLINK)
-(ANDY LAUGHS)

40:45.567 --> 40:48.500
SUE: What is life
without the surprises?

40:48.533 --> 40:52.800
If we knew what to expect
every day, day in, day out,

40:52.833 --> 40:54.267
my personality?

40:55.300 --> 40:57.033
Nah, I like the unknown.

40:57.067 --> 40:58.333
I like the challenge.

41:12.733 --> 41:17.167
All right,
this would make three of them
little beasties.

41:18.567 --> 41:21.300
So I think I'm just gonna
cook them up.

41:21.333 --> 41:24.967
A little garlic,
a little onion,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.800
and go have myself
a little picnic.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.633
It was a big day.

41:32.167 --> 41:34.700
You know,
I was going after the fins

41:34.733 --> 41:39.800
and life had
an alternate meal plan for me
that I wasn't aware of.

41:39.833 --> 41:43.967
I'm grateful for every single
bite this thing's giving me.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.767
And if it's not pretty,
that's okay.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.767
Neither am I. (LAUGHS)

41:50.600 --> 41:53.033
For my fine day's work,

41:53.067 --> 41:55.700
I got a bowl
full of ptarmigan,

41:55.733 --> 41:57.933
a snoot full of single malt,

41:57.967 --> 41:59.800
some stogies for dessert.

41:59.833 --> 42:02.600
So it's time to head outside
and enjoy the day.

42:07.933 --> 42:10.333
If you go back and you look
at the whole year,

42:10.367 --> 42:14.433
I mean, it's been boom bust,
boom bust, just like
the history of Alaska.

42:14.467 --> 42:17.033
Boom, I got the bear that was
roughing up camp.

42:17.067 --> 42:19.033
You know, but that's me,
that's my life.

42:19.067 --> 42:23.300
It's a series of challenges.
Some are natural and
some I create.

42:23.333 --> 42:28.633
And it doesn't get me down.
It just keeps me going,
keeps me learning.

42:28.667 --> 42:33.567
Winter is what it is. It's a
tough son of a bitch up here
on the north slope of Alaska.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.533
And I'm grateful
when summer gets here,

42:36.567 --> 42:39.433
but I'm grateful for every
experience I get. Every day
is new.

42:39.467 --> 42:42.200
Maybe it's a huge problem
that I don't...

42:42.233 --> 42:45.033
I, I didn't really sign up
to get,

42:45.067 --> 42:48.033
but I overcome it and it's one
foot in front of the other.

42:48.067 --> 42:51.867
Not one day of my life
do I wanna stop learning.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.767
I've looked all over my body,
scary as that is,

42:54.800 --> 42:57.600
and I don't see an expiration
date but I know it's coming.

42:57.633 --> 43:00.400
I don't get to pick the day.
It's gonna pick me.

43:00.433 --> 43:03.933
So up until that moment,
full steam ahead.

43:03.967 --> 43:05.600
You know, if it's a horse race

43:06.733 --> 43:08.167
put your bet on this old nag.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.200
'Cause I'm crossing
the finish line.
