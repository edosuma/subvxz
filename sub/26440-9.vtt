-Sir.

02:49.461 --> 02:52.339
The Die Nebenwelt test
is on schedule, sir.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.717
You'll be traveling
with the Reichsfuhrer.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.468
Thank you, Major.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.888
I also have some new information
on the four guards killed

02:58.929 --> 03:01.473
at the Wyoming-Colorado border.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.059
This was pulled from
security camera footage.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.854
We've identified
the female suspect.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.064
Juliana Crain.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.650
-Who's she with?
-His name is Wyatt Price.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.110
He's a black market dealer.

03:13.152 --> 03:16.280
Price was last seen by Agent
Matthews at a Denver hotel.

03:16.322 --> 03:17.615
He was securing travel documents
into the GNR

03:17.656 --> 03:19.158
for his female companion, sir.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.328
Later that night,
one of our valued informants

03:22.369 --> 03:25.456
and another agent were shot down
at that same hotel,

03:25.497 --> 03:27.791
so we are checking all routes
in and out of the GNR.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.919
I want them taken alive.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.046

03:37.843 --> 03:39.219

03:39.261 --> 03:40.679
SECRETARY (over phone):
Reichsmarschall,

03:40.721 --> 03:43.432
the trade minister from Japan
is on line one.

03:43.474 --> 03:46.810
Would you like to speak
with him?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.187
Put him through.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.564
Ah, good morning,
Reichsmarschall.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.149
This is Nobosuke...

03:52.191 --> 03:54.735
SMITH: Yes, Trade Minister,
I know who you are.

03:56.737 --> 04:01.033
I wish to discuss
our growing hostilities.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.826
Why am I talking to you?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.328
I was under the impression

04:04.370 --> 04:07.039
we had an embassy
in San Francisco for that.

04:07.081 --> 04:10.834
War is far too grave a matter

04:10.876 --> 04:13.337
to go through
traditional channels.

04:13.379 --> 04:17.132
I'm requesting an official
meeting between the two of us

04:17.174 --> 04:19.802
to discuss oil embargo

04:19.843 --> 04:22.721
and the Reich's position
on defectors,

04:22.763 --> 04:27.685
including Mr. Wexler, who has
given us files on Die Nebenwelt.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.274
-Die Nebenwelt?
-Yes, Reichsmarschall.

04:34.316 --> 04:39.780
We know of its purpose
and its location in the Poconos.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.326
Where do you propose
this meeting take place?

04:44.368 --> 04:46.954
The Neutral Zone.

04:46.996 --> 04:50.499
I'll get back to you,
Trade Minister.

-This is Juliana.

-Pleasure.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.766
Ah. Wasn't expecting you
for a few months.

06:30.808 --> 06:33.143
Don't suppose you're here
to settle up early.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.854
Sure, but where'd be
the fun in that?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.649
Then why are you here, Wyatt?

06:38.690 --> 06:42.861
Just popping in for drinks
with friends, Vince.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.905
Okay. (chuckles)

06:48.534 --> 06:50.702
You staying out of trouble?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.830
-As much as I can.
-Who are you?

06:52.871 --> 06:56.458
-Friend of Wyatt's.
-Well, aren't we all?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.627
Go easy there, Ledette.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.171
You're good with a rifle,
aren't you?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.927
Depends what I'm shooting at.

How about later?

07:16.645 --> 07:20.232
After we eat, huh?
Come on, it's post time.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.460
And then you and I
are gonna talk.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.427
You in some kind of trouble?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.888
Nah. I can handle Vince.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.767
You knew Chuck was a sniper.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.061
I've seen him before.

This is just the beginning.

-We need it to spread.
-ED: You're right.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.255
Let's do another one.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.090
It's got to be bigger.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.760
You know, someplace
everybody can see.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.638
-I know just the spot.
-You do?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.432
Yeah. We'll need
a lot more paint.

Find out exactly what
they know about Die Nebenwelt,

08:48.528 --> 08:50.822
their intentions.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.532
Yes, of course, sir.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.910
You leave tonight.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.412
And while you're
in the Neutral Zone,

08:57.454 --> 08:59.498
see if you can pick up the trail
of High Castle.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.126
This criminal activity involving
Juliana Crain occurred not far

09:03.168 --> 09:07.839
from his last known residence,
and he remains a priority.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.716
Yes, Mein Fuhrer.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.761
Um, with your permission, um,

09:12.803 --> 09:15.347
it might be helpful
if I could delay the trip

09:15.389 --> 09:17.933
by just one day; there's some
matters I need to attend to.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.978
You have something more
pressing, Reichsmarschall?

09:21.019 --> 09:23.981
No, sir.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.524
Then good.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.193
You'll go.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.529
Yes, Fuhrer.

09:32.906 --> 09:38.078
Meanwhile, John,
put your faith in the Reich.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.758
The apartment
is beautiful, Helen.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.928
-And these views...
-Absolutely stunning.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.555
All of it.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.933
I always knew John would be big,
but this is huge.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.185
So happy for all of you.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.354
Thank you.

10:04.396 --> 10:07.566
Let's have a cocktail, yes?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.193
You look great, by the way.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.571
-Do I?
-Yeah.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.614
We've just,
we've been through so much.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.951
I can't believe
how much has changed.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.454
But I-I'm happy for you.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.250
How are the girls adjusting?

10:25.292 --> 10:28.086
Uh, well.
They love their school.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.339
Well, the city's
a nice distraction.

to us, Helen.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.603
Am I?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.022
After everything
that happened...

10:47.064 --> 10:50.192
We saw you on television
for John's installation.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.486
-Mm.
-LUCY: Standing strong.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.696
Grace under pressure.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.240
You reminded me of Eva Braun.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.621
She had the Fuhrer's ear.
Did you know that?

11:02.662 --> 11:06.291
-She changed Reich policy.
-When did she do that?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.043
During the war.

11:08.085 --> 11:11.129
She lifted the ban on
women's cosmetics and luxuries.

11:11.171 --> 11:15.008
How about that.
I had no idea she was political.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.344
Yes, well, the history books,
they don't mention it.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.804
Then how do you know?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.390
When you are married
to the Reichsmarschall,

11:21.431 --> 11:23.433
-you hear things.

MARY:
Is that true?

11:28.939 --> 11:30.732
I always wondered.

11:30.774 --> 11:35.112
Berlin does a good job of hiding
it, but I have met the man.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.115
Who am I kidding?
They all know.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.034
The ones at the top,
they are protected.

11:41.076 --> 11:44.204
That's the big difference
between Berlin and New York.

11:44.246 --> 11:47.332
You're right.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.334
They'll always be
the Fatherland.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.711
Hmm.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.005
You're not drinking, Helen?

11:54.047 --> 11:57.509
No, it's... (sighs)
a little early for me.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.969

Okay. Say we blow
this fucker up.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.472
What stops them
from building a new one?

12:43.513 --> 12:45.182
That's the beauty.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.559
I spoke to a scientist who
called the area inside the mine

12:47.601 --> 12:49.561
an "anomaly," a place where

12:49.603 --> 12:51.855
the barrier between worlds
is at its thinnest.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.232
WYATT:
This thing draws so much power

12:54.274 --> 12:58.195
that when they fire it up,
the whole area becomes unstable.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.822
Destroy the machine,
destroy the anomaly.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.741
We got to do our homework.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.869
Recon this top to bottom
before we come up with our plan.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.787
CHUCK:
I know a guy in New York.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.748
He's in the Resistance.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.541
-The Poconos are only
a few hours from...
-Stop.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.543
I'm sorry.

13:13.585 --> 13:18.256
Assuming any of this is true,

13:18.298 --> 13:23.762
what good does saving another
world from the Nazis do us?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.348
It's not our fight.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.897
Ledette.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.900
How'd you feel
when you watched that film?

13:36.942 --> 13:39.027
Envy?

13:39.069 --> 13:41.530
What about recognition?

13:41.571 --> 13:44.824
'Cause, I mean, the three of us

13:44.866 --> 13:49.663
spent the worst years
of our lives fucking dreaming

13:49.704 --> 13:51.998
of an outcome like that one.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.668
Killing for it.

13:54.709 --> 13:58.672
So, go ahead,
call your man in New York.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.228
-That was passionate.
-Yep.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.646
You really believed
that rah-rah?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.690
I believe in her.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.858
And I wouldn't ask you
to sign up if I didn't.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.736
You like her?

14:21.778 --> 14:24.030
She's given me something
I can fight for.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.116
Well, she's given you hope.

14:28.159 --> 14:32.622
I haven't seen you like this
in a long time, Liam.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.667

to the Japanese

14:42.924 --> 14:48.179
that we accept their invitation
to a meeting on one condition:

14:48.221 --> 14:50.974
-that we choose the location.
-Yes, sir.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.601
Tell Matthews to secure

14:52.642 --> 14:57.480
High Castle's farmhouse,
outside Boulder.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.482
Prepare it for a meeting.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.776
I'll assemble a unit, sir.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.195
No uniforms, no identification.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.281
We don't want anyone
to know we're there.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.878
TURNER:
On a VIP boat in the harbor.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.255
As close to the action
as possible.

15:22.297 --> 15:25.008
And will Nicole Dormer
be on the boat?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.469
-Yes.
-And where will I be?

15:27.510 --> 15:28.887
On the boat, with me.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.430
Will I have
an interview with her?

15:30.472 --> 15:31.890
No, she'll be directing,
but, uh,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.350
I'll make sure
to get you a statement.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.435
Of course. I think I have this.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.854
Okay, let's take five

16:26.695 --> 16:28.571
FRANK:
Yeah, I know.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.407
We should hit a different city.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.867
You know, do the same
as we've done here.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.286
ED: Yeah, w-we could do
Albuquerque next.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.705
Yeah, I want to do New York,

16:36.746 --> 16:38.581
give the Nazis
something to think about.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.792
This is what freedom feels like.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.336
For the first time, I feel it.
I really do.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.755
And that's what we're fighting
for, you, me and Jules.

16:45.797 --> 16:51.010
Yeah, tomorrow, people are
gonna wake up and see it.

I am so grateful

17:58.161 --> 18:01.539
I... didn't know if you would.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.042
When do you leave?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.252
Tonight.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.963
Is it safe?

18:11.007 --> 18:13.426
I apologize.

18:13.468 --> 18:16.054
For what?

18:16.095 --> 18:20.391
All my life,

18:20.433 --> 18:23.645

20:57.256 --> 20:59.842
There could be a war.

20:59.884 --> 21:04.389
So I have to go and see
if I can head it off.

Yeah. Without Childan

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
(laughs softly)

21:30.206 --> 21:33.626
I meant to tell you,
h-he called me the other day.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.421
Who? Robert?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.256
What'd he say?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.133
I couldn't understand him,
but I'm pretty sure

21:40.174 --> 21:43.970
it had something to do with
the yakuza paying me a visit.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.431
The yakuza? Why?

21:46.472 --> 21:48.433
They found your stuff.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.436
From the robbery?

21:51.477 --> 21:54.772
Wait, why would
they be coming to you?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.607
Tracked me down.

21:56.649 --> 22:01.738
I mean, somebody must have
seen us together here.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.990
I thought you'd be excited
to hear this.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.409
It's the yakuza.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.411
I don't think they know
the first thing about

22:08.453 --> 22:10.580
selling antiques.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.749
You could bring them
back to Bob.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.669
I don't know.

22:18.588 --> 22:22.216
Jack, I don't know if I'm ready
to go back to San Francisco.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.469
I could come with you.

22:26.804 --> 22:29.474
I've always wanted to walk
across the Golden Gate Bridge.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.267
Well, you actually can't walk
across the Golden Gate Bridge,

22:31.309 --> 22:34.437
-'cause it's off-limit
to gaijin.
-Ed.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.689

At the Grand Palace.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.140
Listen, I got all your messages.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.725

found our stuff.

(stammers) Forget the stuff.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.070

No. No, no, no.

what a delightful pleasure.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.975
How may I help you today?

23:54.016 --> 23:55.601
I was, uh, wondering

23:55.643 --> 23:58.229
if you still had
that precious baseball.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.481
The one signed
by the Murderers' Row.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.316
Oh, sumimasen.

24:02.358 --> 24:05.319
I no longer have that item
in my possession.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.446

24:07.488 --> 24:10.283
Delightful pleasure

24:10.324 --> 24:12.869
Kobayashi-san.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.248
Um, I almost forgot.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.250
Rumor has it,

24:19.292 --> 24:23.212
a great influx of Americana
may be moving west from the GNR.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.840
And what is causing this influx?

24:25.882 --> 24:29.760
The Nazis are in the midst
of purging American history.

24:29.802 --> 24:33.431
So, if these rumors are correct,

24:33.472 --> 24:35.141
it would be a great bonanza
for my business.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.686
Hmm. Interesting.

that kept messing up my miners.

37:48.517 --> 37:51.770
Sounds like an anomaly to me.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.106
