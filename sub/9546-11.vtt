00:10.168 --> 00:12.812
I love this song.
What's it called again?

00:12.812 --> 00:13.619
What?

00:13.619 --> 00:16.003
The music box,
what's it called?

00:16.003 --> 00:19.488
- Fullness of spring.
- Fullness of spring.

00:19.722 --> 00:21.852
I can't get it out of my head.

00:24.256 --> 00:26.360
I wish we had taken more pictures.

00:26.929 --> 00:28.569
Hey, can you stay for dinner?

00:28.569 --> 00:30.526
No. I told you, I gotta get home.

00:30.526 --> 00:34.456
Well, at least stay
for a drink to decompress.

00:34.656 --> 00:37.100
Oh! I'll open the santorini.

00:37.100 --> 00:40.431
I know I promised to save it
for a special occasion.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.307
What?

00:41.307 --> 00:43.814
I said, it's our one-week anniversary.

00:43.814 --> 00:45.930
I think that's special enough.

00:53.075 --> 00:54.290
What are you doing?

00:54.290 --> 00:55.632
I, I thought we could...

00:55.632 --> 00:58.119
I told you not to open that.

01:00.077 --> 01:02.195
Hey, there's something in here.

01:03.003 --> 01:04.811
What, what is that?

01:07.652 --> 01:09.050
Put the bottle down, Gail.

01:09.050 --> 01:11.638
What's going on?
You're scaring me.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.695
Put the bottle on the table.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.388
I told you not to open it.

Wait!

02:45.860 --> 02:48.088
Wait, I will take plastic.

02:48.088 --> 02:49.367
- It's too late!
- Too late.

02:49.367 --> 02:51.883
Vegas is not a vacation.
Vegas is a pilgrimage.

02:51.883 --> 02:53.950
Why don't you want to fly
if you want...

02:56.293 --> 02:57.267
I gotta call you back.

02:57.267 --> 02:58.826
Oh, my gosh!
Are you okay?

02:58.826 --> 03:02.350
Oh, I am so sorry.
That is all my fault.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.389
Man, they ought to put blinkers
on these things.

03:06.366 --> 03:07.661
Is this yours or mine?

03:07.661 --> 03:09.953
No, that, that's not mine.
That's yours.

03:09.953 --> 03:11.111
Yeah, well.

03:11.111 --> 03:13.545
Pretty much anything that can kill you,
that's gonna be mine.

03:13.545 --> 03:14.432
Yeah.

03:14.432 --> 03:15.442
I mean, look at this.

03:15.442 --> 03:18.209
Soup for one, frozen meat loaf.

03:18.209 --> 03:20.830
I might as well wear a big sign
that says, "divorced guy."

03:20.830 --> 03:21.903
Yeah.

03:22.173 --> 03:23.740
Ah, here.

03:24.653 --> 03:27.282
Hey, you're, uh,
you're missing two eggs here.

03:27.282 --> 03:31.165
No, no. I, uh, I only
buy 10 at a time.

03:31.165 --> 03:32.742
I know, it's crazy.

03:32.742 --> 03:35.496
No, it makes perfect sense to me.

03:35.496 --> 03:36.339
It does?

03:36.339 --> 03:39.026
Yeah, I mean, why have a decimal system
if you're not gonna use it?

03:39.026 --> 03:41.485
10 at a time, it's brilliant.
I mean, why 12?

03:41.485 --> 03:43.888
Exactly. 12, so arbitrary.

03:43.888 --> 03:45.118
What's this?

03:45.367 --> 03:48.138
Uh, that's bubble wrap.
Protect the apple.

03:48.138 --> 03:49.490
Did, did they do this for you?

03:49.490 --> 03:50.958
No, no. I bring my own.

03:50.958 --> 03:53.571
They, they always tease me about it.

03:53.571 --> 03:54.908
Yeah, well, who's laughing now?

03:54.908 --> 03:56.466
- Look at that thing. It's perfect.
- Yeah.

03:56.466 --> 03:57.927
Whereas mine...

03:58.190 --> 04:00.678
it's all bruised and scuffed up.

04:00.678 --> 04:02.147
You're a genius.

04:02.147 --> 04:04.694
Ah, I don't know about genius.

04:04.694 --> 04:08.242
I like your style, you know?
You play by your own rules.

04:08.242 --> 04:10.164
That's one way of
looking at it, I guess.

04:10.164 --> 04:12.141
Hal, Hal Tucker.

04:12.141 --> 04:13.378
Adrian Monk.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.597
Yeah. Oh, did I do that?

04:15.597 --> 04:17.678
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a little juice...

04:17.678 --> 04:19.550
it's nothing. / You got to send me
the bill for that.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.875
No, no. I have a hundred shirts
just like it at home.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.890
I mean... 99 now.

04:23.890 --> 04:26.064
Well, I always pay my debts.

04:26.064 --> 04:27.922
Adrian Monk, I'm gonna look you up.

04:27.922 --> 04:29.420
I'm gonna pay you back.

05:03.657 --> 05:04.732
I love this song.

05:04.732 --> 05:07.818
My grandfather used to sing it
to me all the time.

05:43.859 --> 05:45.130
You okay?

05:45.130 --> 05:46.634
Ah, yeah.

05:46.634 --> 05:50.506
Can we, uh, think we could
put down the, uh...

05:50.506 --> 05:52.010
the, um...

05:53.548 --> 05:55.757
The toilet seat?

05:58.062 --> 05:58.999
Nope.

05:58.999 --> 06:01.456
Tech guys haven't been here yet.
We can't touch anything.

06:01.456 --> 06:03.664
Yeah. yeah, okay.

06:11.416 --> 06:13.047
Okay, so, uh...

06:13.811 --> 06:16.840
somebody was in the shower.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.484
And then, uh...

06:19.484 --> 06:21.266
so the, um...

06:21.266 --> 06:25.507
I can't, I can't,
I can't think. Um...

06:43.781 --> 06:45.000
Nah, keep it.

06:45.712 --> 06:47.004
Just keep it.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.756
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.067
Candle's full of water.

07:07.290 --> 07:09.698
These are soaking wet.

07:11.766 --> 07:13.333
Okay, he was in the shower.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.944
Something happened,
she said something.

07:14.944 --> 07:16.143
He was upset.

07:16.143 --> 07:17.377
He opened the shower curtain,

07:17.377 --> 07:19.654
didn't even bother to stop
to turn off the water.

07:19.654 --> 07:21.981
He grabbed the top towel.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.679
Went into the other room
and killed her.

07:32.915 --> 07:35.182
You're pretty damned good
when the toilet seat's down.

07:35.182 --> 07:37.305
Captain, we know her.

07:37.305 --> 07:38.904
Uh, knew her.

07:39.109 --> 07:40.508
- Knew who?
- Uh, the victim.

07:40.508 --> 07:42.852
She was a dispatcher at the old precinct.

07:42.852 --> 07:44.140
No kidding.

07:49.718 --> 07:51.804
Oh, yeah. About 10 years ago.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.353
- Gail something.
- Gail. Gail Segalis.

07:54.353 --> 07:57.233
Oh, my god. I used to carpool with her.

07:57.233 --> 08:00.364
Oh, she was always talking
about trips she wanted to take.

08:00.364 --> 08:02.018
She said if she ever
made it to the Parthenon,

08:02.018 --> 08:03.537
she was gonna send me a picture.

08:03.537 --> 08:05.527
Well, looks like she made it.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.394
Hey, is this a boyfriend?

08:12.394 --> 08:14.430
I love boyfriends.
Let's find him.

08:14.430 --> 08:15.537
Yes, sir.

08:15.537 --> 08:16.647
What's this?

08:16.647 --> 08:18.171
Hmm? What do you got?

08:18.726 --> 08:20.126
I don't know.

08:26.019 --> 08:28.550
The price is in Euros.
She brought it back with her.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.439
Uh, where's the wine?

08:30.902 --> 08:32.693
Probably drank it.

08:32.693 --> 08:34.177
Where's the bottle?

08:34.610 --> 08:35.725
Hello?

08:36.561 --> 08:37.717
Yes.

08:38.014 --> 08:40.049
He's right here.
Who's this?

08:40.538 --> 08:42.030
The what?

08:42.918 --> 08:45.011
A friend of whose?

08:46.415 --> 08:48.847
This is Adrian Monk.

08:49.592 --> 08:51.832
What number are you calling?

08:52.959 --> 08:55.579
Uh, yeah. Hold on.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.449
Uh, Mr. Monk?

08:57.703 --> 08:59.037
It's Hal?

08:59.037 --> 09:00.207
Hal?

09:00.447 --> 09:01.888
Hal?

09:02.178 --> 09:04.068
He called me?

09:09.821 --> 09:10.978
Hello?

09:12.059 --> 09:15.491
Yeah, yeah, of course I remember you.

09:15.491 --> 09:16.835
Yeah.

09:16.835 --> 09:17.805
Oh, it was...

09:17.805 --> 09:20.621
yeah, it was nice meeting you too.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.727
Bumping into you.

09:22.727 --> 09:26.707
All right, I get it, I get it.
It was a play on words.

09:26.707 --> 09:28.850
Yeah. Huh?

09:28.850 --> 09:32.279
Oh, that was, that was
just my assistant Natalie.

09:32.279 --> 09:33.579
Huh?

09:33.776 --> 09:37.372
Uh, uh, hold on.
Hold on, I'll see.

09:37.372 --> 09:38.948
Are you hot?

09:38.948 --> 09:40.330
What?

09:42.228 --> 09:43.991
What, tom, tomorrow?

09:43.991 --> 09:46.151
Oh, sure. I...

09:46.151 --> 09:48.132
sure, that sounds...

09:48.132 --> 09:49.426
okay.

09:49.771 --> 09:50.734
Okay.

09:50.734 --> 09:52.346
Yeah, that sounds great.

09:52.346 --> 09:54.903
All right, okay, great.
I'll see you then.

09:56.837 --> 09:58.213
That was Hal.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.020
Who is Hal?

10:00.020 --> 10:02.190
Oh, he's just a guy.
He's a friend.

10:02.190 --> 10:04.068
We're going to
the hockey game tomorrow.

10:04.068 --> 10:05.382
- The hockey game?
- Yeah.

10:05.382 --> 10:06.998
Hey, Kramer, what're you
doing tomorrow?

10:06.998 --> 10:09.039
- Going to the beach with the kids.
- Can't go with you.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.894
I'm going to the hockey game.

10:12.877 --> 10:15.226
Captain, you don't
need me tomorrow, do you?

10:15.226 --> 10:16.118
No.

10:16.118 --> 10:18.394
Good, 'cause I'm going to the game.

10:19.815 --> 10:22.823
Yeah. I heard.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.314
Oh, my god!

10:25.314 --> 10:27.254
Oh, my god!
He's gonna be here any minute!

10:27.254 --> 10:30.071
Any minute!
Julie, Julie, put on some music.

10:30.071 --> 10:31.535
Please, Natalie, don't go away.

10:31.535 --> 10:33.185
Stay, stay right there.

10:33.185 --> 10:35.284
I need you. I need you.

10:35.485 --> 10:36.687
Natalie?

10:36.892 --> 10:39.033
- Which one? Which?
- They're exactly...

10:39.033 --> 10:40.569
- Which one?
That one!

10:40.858 --> 10:42.324
Mr. Monk, you're gonna
have a heart attack.

10:42.324 --> 10:44.208
No, no. I'm fine. I'm okay.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.299
Just, uh, just, uh...

10:45.299 --> 10:46.734
keep going, ask me another one.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.967
Uh, okay, uh, what's a forward line?

10:48.967 --> 10:50.265
Ah, in professional hockey.

10:50.265 --> 10:53.986
The forward line consists of
the right wing and the left wing.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.218
And the center.

10:55.218 --> 11:00.164
This year the Sharks have had
a outstanding forward line.

11:00.164 --> 11:01.374
Outstanding.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.583
Let's, let's say their names.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.978
Okay, Joe Thornton.

11:04.978 --> 11:07.455
Uh, uh, uh...

11:07.455 --> 11:09.655
oh, Kaspar, no!

11:09.655 --> 11:12.097
Mr. Monk, why don't you just be honest?
Tell him it's your first game.

11:12.097 --> 11:14.561
No, no, no. I tried that honesty thing.
It was a total disaster.

11:14.561 --> 11:15.881
No, no, no, no, julie.

11:15.881 --> 11:19.101
No, no, no, not classical.
Put on something cool.

11:19.101 --> 11:20.615
You know, the rock and the roll.

11:20.615 --> 11:24.041
- You don't have any rock and roll.
- Well, not... not classical.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.658
Anything but classical.

11:25.658 --> 11:29.874
Mr. Monk, he's just a guy.
He can't be the first friend you've ever had.

11:38.119 --> 11:39.769
What are you doing?

11:39.964 --> 11:42.973
- I'm cleaning.
- No, I don't want it too clean!

11:42.973 --> 11:45.723
He'll think I'm some kind of a freak.
I left five crumbs out.

11:45.723 --> 11:47.415
Yeah, I only see
one, two, three, four.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.140
Four! God!

11:49.140 --> 11:50.184
Four.

11:50.497 --> 11:51.787
Here, here it is.

11:51.787 --> 11:54.161
Okay, there it is.

11:55.830 --> 11:56.808
Adrian?

11:56.808 --> 11:58.413
Hey, Hal!

11:58.614 --> 12:01.281
Hey, there. I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

12:01.281 --> 12:02.711
Oh, Hal's here.

12:02.711 --> 12:04.446
I brought in your mail.

12:04.446 --> 12:06.345
Hey, nice crib.

12:06.345 --> 12:09.165
Oh, yeah, uh, thanks.

12:10.486 --> 12:12.311
Patriotic, I like that.

12:12.311 --> 12:13.878
Most people wouldn't have the guts.

12:13.878 --> 12:16.113
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

12:16.337 --> 12:18.444
So this is my crib.

12:18.444 --> 12:19.577
Yeah.

12:19.577 --> 12:22.103
Excuse the mess, okay?

12:22.103 --> 12:22.905
What mess?

12:22.905 --> 12:25.251
Well, you know, the crumbs,
there's five crumbs there.

12:25.251 --> 12:26.564
This is Natalie.

12:26.564 --> 12:28.478
Oh, his girl Friday.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.249
Well, it's nice to put
a face to the voice,

12:30.249 --> 12:32.748
especially a face like that.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.204
Funny, right?

12:35.204 --> 12:37.242
And this is, uh...

12:37.495 --> 12:38.812
um, uh...

12:38.812 --> 12:40.596
- Julie.
- Doh!

12:40.743 --> 12:43.411
- Hello.
- Hi. Hal. Nice to meet you.

12:43.411 --> 12:46.396
Hey, are you guys hockey fans?
Next time I'll get four tickets.

12:46.396 --> 12:47.982
The coach is a client of mine.

12:47.982 --> 12:49.133
Oh, what do you do?

12:49.133 --> 12:51.982
Antiques.
Import/export.

12:51.982 --> 12:54.456
Don't redecorate your room
without calling me first.

12:54.456 --> 12:56.865
Rugs, tables.
You name it, I'll get it, okay?

12:56.865 --> 12:58.958
- Okay.
- All right.

12:58.958 --> 13:01.012
So, you ready to roll?

13:01.012 --> 13:02.512
It's gonna be a great game.

13:02.512 --> 13:04.152
Absolutely. Go Sharks!

13:04.152 --> 13:06.700
Oh, I love it! That's great.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.485
- We'll see you later.
- We'll see you later.

13:15.632 --> 13:16.780
I like him.

13:16.780 --> 13:18.436
Yeah, I do too.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.660
Wonder what he's up to.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.501
Take the shot!

13:37.277 --> 13:39.942
Come on, take the shot!
Take the shot!

13:40.602 --> 13:42.213
Take the shot!

13:42.213 --> 13:44.111
Take the shot!

13:44.963 --> 13:46.344
How about these seats, huh?

13:46.344 --> 13:47.708
Oh, they're excellent.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.849
- They're really bolted in.
- Yeah.

13:50.171 --> 13:51.403
Go Sharks!

13:53.427 --> 13:54.843
Oh, hell!

13:54.843 --> 13:57.307
Did you see that?
What the hell was that?

13:57.307 --> 13:58.829
The hell if I know!

13:58.829 --> 14:02.673
What the hell was that?
Hell.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.267
Cheech is really off his game tonight.

14:07.267 --> 14:13.126
Yes. Yes, last year, Jonathan Cheechoo,
whose nickname is Cheech,

14:13.126 --> 14:16.386
was the third highest-scoring
right wing in the league.

14:16.386 --> 14:18.684
He was born in Ontario.

14:18.684 --> 14:21.118
Really? That's interesting.

14:21.118 --> 14:23.201
- It is?
- Yeah.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.741
All right!

14:37.516 --> 14:39.093
All right.

14:54.199 --> 14:55.366
Smudge.

14:55.366 --> 14:56.651
What?

14:56.859 --> 14:58.804
There's a smudge.

14:58.804 --> 15:00.625
On the glass.

15:03.597 --> 15:05.144
It's on the inside.

15:05.144 --> 15:06.936
We can't get it.

15:07.918 --> 15:09.438
Right.

15:12.447 --> 15:14.511
It's no big deal, right?

15:14.511 --> 15:15.562
No.

15:15.562 --> 15:18.108
Who cares? Right?

15:22.578 --> 15:24.919
Let's just think about something else.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.987
Hey! Hey, there's a smudge here.

15:36.987 --> 15:38.524
Can you get that smudge?

15:38.524 --> 15:40.106
There's a smudge right there.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.280
Yeah, right there.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.461
Just take it out.

15:42.461 --> 15:43.885
No. No, no, no, wait.

15:43.885 --> 15:45.292
There's a some... Come back!

15:45.292 --> 15:48.355
- there's still some left.
- Hey, down in front!

15:48.652 --> 15:49.955
You got a problem?

15:49.955 --> 15:51.357
With him, not with you.

15:51.357 --> 15:53.893
You got a problem with him,
you got a problem with me.

15:53.893 --> 15:56.287
Okay, no big deal.

16:13.717 --> 16:15.141
It's embarrassing.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.370
No! It's a great idea.
It's a battle zone out there.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.600
They should hand these things
out at the door.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.946
Hal! I thought that was you.

16:23.946 --> 16:25.583
Eddie Lawson from the firm.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.188
Yeah, man, how you doing?

16:27.188 --> 16:28.711
You look good, man.

16:28.711 --> 16:30.556
How long you been out?

16:30.556 --> 16:33.303
- About a year-and-a-half.
- A year-and-a-half?

16:33.303 --> 16:35.375
You had a better lawyer than me.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.941
Hey, you ever talk to
Charlie the pirate?

16:38.262 --> 16:39.744
Sometimes. Yeah, I do.

16:39.744 --> 16:41.344
Yeah, well, tell him to call me.

16:41.344 --> 16:44.218
He still owes me 50 large
from that thing.

16:44.218 --> 16:45.337
I'll do that.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.311
I gotta go. Take it easy.

16:47.311 --> 16:48.863
But take it.

16:49.455 --> 16:50.707
See you.

16:52.202 --> 16:53.981
Well, now you know.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.195
You did some time.

16:56.465 --> 16:58.842
I bought some coins in Turkey.

16:58.842 --> 17:02.340
Beautiful pieces. 11th century.

17:02.545 --> 17:05.784
Turns out they were hot.
I did 8 months.

17:05.784 --> 17:07.219
I was gonna tell you earlier,

17:07.219 --> 17:10.089
but then I found out
you were a cop and...

17:10.369 --> 17:14.061
if you wanted to go home right now,
I mean, I wouldn't blame you.

17:14.393 --> 17:16.414
Why would I want to go home?

17:16.618 --> 17:17.814
I'm having a great time.

17:17.814 --> 17:19.007
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:19.007 --> 17:20.723
So we're still on for tomorrow, then.

17:20.723 --> 17:22.580
Yeah. / All right.

17:24.624 --> 17:27.029
I told you, I was
at my restaurant all day.

17:27.029 --> 17:29.408
I got 15 people on staff.
Why don't you ask them?

17:29.408 --> 17:30.666
Well, they work for you, right?

17:30.666 --> 17:33.345
They're not gonna lie for me.
Not about this.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.788
I mean, you work for him, right?
You gonna lie for him?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.733
I mean, about a murder?

17:37.958 --> 17:40.024
I think about that a lot, actually.

17:40.024 --> 17:42.836
I mean, of course, it would
depend on a number of factors...

17:42.836 --> 17:46.326
We're not talking about him.
We're talking about you.

17:49.932 --> 17:51.621
I took her to Greece.

17:51.621 --> 17:54.235
She'd been wanting to go for years.

17:55.248 --> 17:58.552
She got back Friday morning.
She was dead three hours later.

17:58.552 --> 18:00.447
I didn't come back with her.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.723
She dumped me.

18:01.723 --> 18:03.542
She met someone at the hotel.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.145
Second day we were there.

18:05.145 --> 18:07.291
So I decided to come back early,
Tuesday night.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.990
- You can check that too.
- Oh? Who was he?

18:09.990 --> 18:11.501
She wouldn't tell me his name.

18:11.501 --> 18:14.152
I saw him. He had a beard.
I guess she likes beards.

18:14.152 --> 18:16.585
- And money.
- How do you know?

18:16.821 --> 18:18.806
About the money, not the beard.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.927
I could smell it.

18:19.927 --> 18:21.250
Plus, he gave her a bottle of wine.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.769
Santorini, it must have
cost him 500 bucks.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.496
Would you recognize him again
if you saw him?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.176
Oh, yeah.

18:28.826 --> 18:29.655
Call Athens,

18:29.655 --> 18:34.008
check the hotel guest lists against
the list of passengers on her flight home.

18:34.008 --> 18:35.694
- Yes, sir.
- Did you hear that?

18:35.694 --> 18:39.204
Sorry, I wasn't listening.
I'll, I'll hear the tape.

18:39.204 --> 18:40.401
We didn't record it.

18:40.401 --> 18:41.763
That's okay.
I was half-listening,

18:41.763 --> 18:43.167
so I'll play it back in my head later.

18:43.167 --> 18:46.317
Mr. Monk was just telling me
about his big date.

18:46.317 --> 18:47.514
You mean the guy on the phone?

18:47.514 --> 18:48.946
I thought that was a prank.

18:48.946 --> 18:52.582
No, why, why would you
think it was a prank?

18:52.582 --> 18:54.140
No reason.

18:55.124 --> 18:56.323
Uh, how was the hockey game?

18:56.323 --> 18:57.455
Great! Great game.

18:57.455 --> 18:58.641
We won.

18:58.641 --> 19:01.315
The San Jose Sharks 4, visitors 2.

19:01.315 --> 19:03.381
It was a lot of fun.
It was so much fun.

19:03.381 --> 19:06.880
And then later we went out
for brews and beer.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.436
Brews and beer?

19:09.756 --> 19:11.698
Actually, there is...

19:13.154 --> 19:16.063
Monk, you know that I worked Vice
for a couple of years? / Yeah.

19:16.063 --> 19:20.703
Sometimes a scam artist will
spend a couple of days with a guy
before asking him for money.

19:20.703 --> 19:23.441
- It's called softening the mark.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

19:23.441 --> 19:25.711
Hal is not a con artist, no.

19:25.711 --> 19:28.088
Why would anybody con me?
I don't have any money.

19:28.088 --> 19:30.455
Does he know you don't have any money?

19:30.455 --> 19:34.251
Yeah. / Did you tell him
you don't have any money?

19:35.843 --> 19:37.838
Wait. Wait.

19:37.838 --> 19:40.913
I think I know what this is about.

19:41.273 --> 19:45.190
You guys are worried
that I'm gonna ask him...

19:45.190 --> 19:47.573
to be my best friend.
Don't worry.

19:47.573 --> 19:48.449
Please.

19:48.449 --> 19:49.881
Hal and I just met.

19:49.881 --> 19:54.171
We are nowhere near making
that kind of commitment.

19:54.171 --> 19:56.997
You guys. Unbelievable.

19:57.242 --> 19:59.318
What kinda guy do you think I am?

20:08.303 --> 20:10.713
- Ah, this is the life, huh?
- Yeah.

20:10.713 --> 20:13.942
A sonny chow movie, pepperoni pizza,
a couple of guys hanging out.

20:13.942 --> 20:15.157
Absolutely.

20:15.157 --> 20:17.576
I'm sorry I had to
send that first one back.

20:17.576 --> 20:20.225
Oh, don't worry about it.
No, you were totally right.

20:20.225 --> 20:22.237
Sliced 10 ways makes all the difference.

20:22.237 --> 20:24.441
- That's all I'm saying.
- Yeah.

20:24.441 --> 20:27.139
Hey, listen, I'm gonna go help myself
to one of those bruise-free apples.

20:27.139 --> 20:28.304
- You want one?
- No. I'm good.

20:28.304 --> 20:29.469
All right.

20:30.887 --> 20:32.183
Oh, your mail's here.

20:32.183 --> 20:33.716
I'll get it for you.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.745
Junk mail.
Don't you hate it?

20:45.745 --> 20:46.582
Yeah.

20:46.582 --> 20:50.275
All those trees chopped down
just to make a bunch of stupid catalogs.

20:50.275 --> 20:51.444
Right.

20:52.075 --> 20:53.747
I love this part.

20:53.747 --> 20:55.115
I can see why.

20:55.115 --> 20:56.497
Oh, yeah.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.289
Crank it up.

21:20.831 --> 21:24.338
Sorry, we're closed.
Closed on Mondays.

21:24.338 --> 21:26.630
I want to make a reservation.

21:26.630 --> 21:29.203
Call tomorrow.
We're open at noon.

21:29.203 --> 21:31.794
Yeah, but I'm here now.
It'll only take a minute.

21:31.794 --> 21:34.000
Come on, I promised my wife.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.586
Hi, you, Tim.

21:41.046 --> 21:42.299
Remember me?

21:42.299 --> 21:43.306
We met in Greece.

21:43.306 --> 21:44.805
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah.

21:44.805 --> 21:47.512
- You shaved your beard.
- Yeah.

21:47.512 --> 21:49.104
Gail didn't like it.

21:49.104 --> 21:51.236
You remember Gail, don't you?

21:51.236 --> 21:53.082
The cops are looking for you.

21:53.082 --> 21:55.906
I know that, Tim.
That's why I'm here.

21:55.906 --> 21:57.645
They show you any mug shots of me?

21:57.645 --> 21:59.450
- Not yet.
- Good.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.274
Then I'm not too late.

23:01.602 --> 23:03.978
You know, he sounds like a great guy.

23:03.978 --> 23:06.701
He is.
Oh, he's a great guy!

23:06.701 --> 23:10.160
Well, having a good friend,
Adrian, is a blessing.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.381
Yeah.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.299
- He's outside right now waiting for me.
- Really?

23:14.299 --> 23:16.237
Yeah, we're going back
to my place after the session,

23:16.237 --> 23:18.500
just to hang, you know, out.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.780
That's what we do.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.298
We hang out.

23:21.298 --> 23:24.267
We went out last night, me and Hal.

23:24.774 --> 23:26.736
- To a bar!
- To a bar?

23:26.736 --> 23:29.382
Yeah, it was so much fun!

23:29.382 --> 23:30.961
You should have seen Hal.

23:30.961 --> 23:34.164
He was talking to two girls at once.

23:34.164 --> 23:39.338
Saying, saying...
funny things.

23:39.338 --> 23:41.926
Everybody was laughing and...

23:41.926 --> 23:44.832
Adrian, this is,
this is really amazing.

23:44.832 --> 23:47.641
And it's very significant.

23:48.449 --> 23:51.260
I always wanted a best friend.

23:51.777 --> 23:55.167
I used to pray for it every Christmas.

23:57.158 --> 23:59.111
Best friend.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.466
That's what was missing.

24:02.928 --> 24:04.889
One friend...

24:05.238 --> 24:07.725
would have made it all bearable.

24:08.195 --> 24:09.773
Well...

24:10.338 --> 24:12.463
you had Trudy.

24:12.777 --> 24:14.501
That was different.

24:14.501 --> 24:16.574
Trudy loved me.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.990
But Hal...

24:18.990 --> 24:21.863
likes me.

24:23.492 --> 24:25.529
Beautifully put.

24:25.529 --> 24:26.724
You know what I'm gonna do?

24:26.724 --> 24:28.618
I just decided.

24:29.202 --> 24:32.621
I'm gonna ask Hal
if he'll be my best friend.

24:34.812 --> 24:38.165
You know, I, I've never heard it
put quite that way.

24:38.165 --> 24:41.952
I just have to figure out
when to pop the question.

24:43.643 --> 24:46.300
Do you have any advice?

24:46.501 --> 24:48.848
- About...
- About when to pop the question!

24:48.848 --> 24:51.119
No! No, I, I don't.

24:51.119 --> 24:51.949
Nothing.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.100
No.

24:57.427 --> 24:59.293
Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?

24:59.293 --> 25:00.997
I think it went pretty well.

25:00.997 --> 25:02.139
I told him all about you.

25:02.139 --> 25:04.315
Oh, hey, I'm famous.

25:04.315 --> 25:06.046
So, you want to head over to your place?

25:06.046 --> 25:08.016
You promised to show me
that rock polisher.

25:08.016 --> 25:09.995
I'm parked right over here.

25:11.507 --> 25:13.924
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:13.924 --> 25:18.717
Look, uh, just something, uh,
I, I've been wanting to say.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.907
More of a question, really.

25:20.907 --> 25:23.199
I know we haven't known
each other that long...

25:23.199 --> 25:24.360
Mr. Monk, thank god!

25:24.360 --> 25:25.262
Hey, Hal.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.722
- Hey!
- The captain just called.

25:26.722 --> 25:28.706
They found a body,
Gail Segalis' boyfriend.

25:28.706 --> 25:30.935
He was killed in his restaurant.

25:31.682 --> 25:34.185
I'm sorry, I, I got to go.

25:34.185 --> 25:36.909
Hey. Do you mind if I tag along?

25:36.909 --> 25:40.932
I've never seen a real crime scene,
except on TV.

25:41.829 --> 25:42.896
Can he?

25:42.896 --> 25:44.704
Can he come?
He can be my guest.

25:44.704 --> 25:46.706
Mr. Monk, it's a crime scene.
It's not a party.

25:46.706 --> 25:48.490
Natalie! It's Hal.

25:48.490 --> 25:50.630
Come on, the captain won't mind.

25:50.630 --> 25:52.824
We'll tell him you're with me.

25:52.824 --> 25:55.238
And that you're just gonna watch.

25:55.952 --> 25:57.277
All right, when we get there,
be careful.

25:57.277 --> 25:59.082
You can't get your
fingerprints on anything.

25:59.082 --> 26:02.168
Yeah, that would be funny.
'Cause then you'd have to arrest me.

26:32.597 --> 26:33.945
See anything?

26:34.374 --> 26:35.288
Nothing much.

26:35.288 --> 26:36.270
Captain!

26:39.600 --> 26:40.488
Murder weapon.

26:40.488 --> 26:42.504
Boys found it under the stove.

26:42.504 --> 26:44.000
The handle's cracked.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.301
Is that from hitting the guy?

26:45.301 --> 26:46.329
Yeah, that's right.

26:46.329 --> 26:48.280
The serial number's been filed off too.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.817
Makes it almost impossible to trace.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.389
Are you reporting to him now?

26:53.660 --> 26:56.076
The serial number's been filed off.
Makes it almost impossible... / Thank you.

26:56.076 --> 27:00.267
You know, I read an article about
all the crime in this neighborhood,

27:00.267 --> 27:02.048
how it's all drug-related.

27:02.048 --> 27:03.601
Nah, this was no junkie, though.

27:03.601 --> 27:05.660
This was personal.
This was very deliberate.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.377
If he'd been that desperate,

27:07.377 --> 27:10.975
he would have gone through
the victim's pockets. See?

27:10.975 --> 27:13.796
Yep. I've never known a junkie not to.

27:13.796 --> 27:18.126
And our guy's still wearing
his watch, ring...

27:18.446 --> 27:20.371
- You okay?
- Oh!

27:20.371 --> 27:24.073
Yeah, I just dropped my shades.

27:26.992 --> 27:28.263
Hey, Monk?

27:28.263 --> 27:30.511
Do me a favor.
Check the alley in the back, there.

27:30.511 --> 27:33.455
- See if we missed something.
- Sure. Be right back.

27:33.455 --> 27:36.082
Hal, this is pretty cool, right?

27:36.082 --> 27:38.023
Very cool.

27:39.277 --> 27:41.281
Can you get that down
to the lab for me?

27:41.281 --> 27:44.082
Hal, can I speak to you
for a minute in there?

27:44.082 --> 27:45.774
- Sure.
- Thank you.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.684
Here, have a seat.

27:54.219 --> 27:55.509
What's going on?

27:55.509 --> 27:58.929
That's exactly what we were
wondering, Mr. Tucker.

27:58.929 --> 28:02.748
You mind telling us why you've
been hanging out with Monk?

28:02.748 --> 28:06.413
Well, he's a good guy.
He's a lot of fun.

28:13.811 --> 28:18.126
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
why are you hanging with Monk?

28:18.388 --> 28:20.771
You know he doesn't have any money.

28:21.702 --> 28:22.971
So what?

28:22.971 --> 28:24.542
Does he know you have a record?

28:24.542 --> 28:27.159
Receiving stolen property.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.897
Yeah.

28:29.897 --> 28:33.428
Yeah, he knows all about it,
and he's cool with it.

28:33.428 --> 28:35.660
What's this got to do with you?

28:35.660 --> 28:37.546
We love him.

28:37.819 --> 28:39.517
Oh, you do?

28:39.517 --> 28:41.256
Then when's the last time
you hung out with him,

28:41.256 --> 28:45.379
you know, just to hang out,
or called him just to talk?

28:45.379 --> 28:46.845
He is a great guy.

28:46.845 --> 28:50.683
He's odd and funny and brilliant.

28:50.683 --> 28:53.132
But you wouldn't know that.

28:53.393 --> 28:56.253
I mean, to you, he's just
some sort of crime-solving machine.

28:56.253 --> 28:58.954
A robot that you wind up
and point at a crime scene

28:58.954 --> 29:01.830
and let him do your job for you.

29:01.830 --> 29:04.682
And to you, he's
your funny, quirky boss.

29:04.682 --> 29:09.313
That you can make fun of and
tell stories about behind his back.

29:09.821 --> 29:12.388
What kind of friends are you?

29:12.388 --> 29:16.006
If Adrian Monk has a problem,
it's not with me.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.566
- You ready?
- Yeah.

29:24.566 --> 29:26.408
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

29:28.171 --> 29:30.757
Oh, wow!

29:30.757 --> 29:33.613
It's fantastic!
That's so smooth. / Yeah.

29:33.613 --> 29:35.179
I gotta get one of these things.

29:35.179 --> 29:37.487
We could start a club or something.

29:37.487 --> 29:40.308
Oh, there's your mail.
I'll get it for you.

29:40.308 --> 29:41.969
You get started on this one
while I'm gone.

29:41.969 --> 29:43.177
All right.

29:58.064 --> 30:01.035
Mr. Monk, I finally made it!
With my new boyfriend! - Love, Gail.

30:12.281 --> 30:15.343
Oh, I did this one last week.

30:15.343 --> 30:16.616
Yeah, that's great.

30:16.616 --> 30:18.354
Listen, uh, I just remembered.

30:18.354 --> 30:20.689
I have an appointment downtown
with a client,

30:20.689 --> 30:22.264
so, uh, I'll call you later.

30:22.264 --> 30:24.696
Okay, yeah, Hal!
Wait, uh, before you go.

30:24.696 --> 30:29.178
There's, uh, something
I've been meaning to say. Uh...

30:29.401 --> 30:33.290
I'm really glad we met.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.868
Yeah, me too. I'll call you.

30:34.868 --> 30:36.626
Yeah, yeah, uh, you know,

30:36.626 --> 30:40.608
I, I, I know this sounds childish,
but, um...

30:40.608 --> 30:44.044
if you wanted to say
we were best friends,

30:44.300 --> 30:46.177
that would be cool with me.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.516
Yeah, sounds great.
Let's do it.

30:48.964 --> 30:50.109
Really?

30:50.848 --> 30:53.010
Yeah, look, I really gotta go.

30:53.010 --> 30:55.010
- I'll catch you later.
- Yeah.

31:03.679 --> 31:05.088
Dr. Kroger.

31:05.088 --> 31:07.459
I'm sorry to call you at home.

31:08.654 --> 31:10.315
He said yes!

31:20.939 --> 31:23.773
Why doesn't he call?

31:23.979 --> 31:26.543
It's been two and a half days.

31:26.543 --> 31:28.113
Why don't you call him?

31:28.113 --> 31:29.665
I did.

31:29.665 --> 31:32.723
I left 14 messages.

31:33.573 --> 31:35.798
Must have said something.

31:35.798 --> 31:38.097
Done something.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.690
I came on too strong.

31:43.148 --> 31:45.206
Scared him off.

31:45.650 --> 31:48.635
So now I'm back to zero friends.

31:48.635 --> 31:50.499
Mr. Monk, I'm your friend.

31:50.499 --> 31:52.060
'cause I pay you!

31:52.060 --> 31:54.239
You don't pay me that much.

31:55.654 --> 31:59.230
There's this girl in my grade,
Jenny Merrick.

31:59.523 --> 32:02.068
And when Becky Zucker
stopped talking to her,

32:02.068 --> 32:03.548
you know what she did?

32:03.548 --> 32:07.953
She told everybody
that Becky wets her bed.

32:10.218 --> 32:12.270
Thanks, Julie!

32:12.706 --> 32:14.149
Oh! That's him.

32:14.922 --> 32:16.881
That's him.
It's him, it's him,

32:16.881 --> 32:18.497
it's him, it's him!

32:18.497 --> 32:19.921
But how do you know?

32:19.921 --> 32:22.676
Who else could it be?
You're right here.

32:32.232 --> 32:33.763
Hello?

32:36.030 --> 32:37.388
Yeah.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.262
She's right here.

32:44.744 --> 32:48.305
It's for you.
It's your friend, Bonnie.

32:48.305 --> 32:51.495
I'm sorry. I gave her this number.

32:52.812 --> 32:54.332
Hi.

32:54.783 --> 32:59.931
No, I can't talk right now.
My mom's boss is crying again.

33:06.538 --> 33:08.283
Mr. Monk, you can't just
sit here and sulk.

33:08.283 --> 33:10.402
- It's killing you.
- It's killing me.

33:10.402 --> 33:12.685
You know where he lives,
go over there.

33:12.685 --> 33:14.637
He's your friend, right?

33:14.637 --> 33:16.999
You know, talk to him.
See what the problem is.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.612
Man to man.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.865
Man to man.

33:44.242 --> 33:45.264
Hello.

33:45.606 --> 33:47.731
- Adrian.
- Who is your friend?

33:47.731 --> 33:50.239
- What are you doing here?
- Does he work for the phone company?

33:50.239 --> 33:53.091
'Cause your phone must be broken.
I've been calling and calling.

33:53.091 --> 33:54.897
Okay, I'm sorry.
I've just been really busy.

33:54.897 --> 33:57.047
I will not be toyed with, Hal!

33:57.047 --> 33:58.607
Look, we were just having dinner.

33:58.607 --> 33:59.761
Where?

34:00.458 --> 34:02.420
Where, Scotty's pub?

34:02.420 --> 34:03.868
Were you in our booth?

34:03.868 --> 34:05.319
Oh, Hal?

34:05.538 --> 34:06.691
Look.

34:07.486 --> 34:09.580
I bought tickets for us.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.489
Got, uh, Disney on ice.

34:11.489 --> 34:14.029
That's, like, animals ice skating, I think.

34:14.029 --> 34:16.414
And, uh, women's volleyball,

34:16.414 --> 34:19.784
and something called Pearl Jam.

34:20.108 --> 34:22.135
I just want another chance.

34:22.135 --> 34:25.373
Whatever I did, I take it back.
I can change. I can...

34:25.373 --> 34:27.063
change.

34:27.063 --> 34:29.649
I've never actually done it,
but I'd like to give it a try.

34:29.649 --> 34:30.873
He doesn't like hard rock.

34:30.873 --> 34:32.052
You!

34:32.274 --> 34:35.846
Don't know the first thing about Hal,
so don't pretend you do.

34:35.846 --> 34:38.589
How does he like his hamburgers, huh?

34:38.589 --> 34:41.040
Didn't hear that.
Medium rare!

34:41.476 --> 34:43.745
Can you name three of his shirts?
'Cause I can.

34:43.745 --> 34:45.824
The turquoise one, the yellow one,
and the one he's wearing now.

34:45.824 --> 34:47.636
Adrian. Come on.

34:47.636 --> 34:50.748
We had some laughs,
but to tell the truth,

34:50.748 --> 34:52.639
we don't really have
that much in common.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.513
He wets his bed.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.183
What?

34:58.734 --> 35:01.361
Michael, I'm sorry.
But we...

35:01.361 --> 35:03.062
- All right, I understand.
- Yeah.

35:03.062 --> 35:04.162
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:04.162 --> 35:06.911
And don't forget to bring
the merchandise. / I won't.

35:07.661 --> 35:09.319
Bye-bye, Mikey.

35:12.214 --> 35:14.359
- Adrian.
- Your bag.

35:17.418 --> 35:19.525
Santorini.

35:20.772 --> 35:23.827
What's, what's in here?
It's heavy.

35:23.827 --> 35:27.534
You, you bought this in Europe.

35:29.678 --> 35:31.979
Boy, am I glad he's gone, huh?

35:31.979 --> 35:36.664
Huh? / He gets so jealous when I'm
around my friends, you know?

35:36.664 --> 35:37.863
Really?

35:37.863 --> 35:40.093
Yeah, you know, Adrian,
I'm so glad you're here

35:40.093 --> 35:43.445
'cause, uh, my mother's
coming over in a little while.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.743
Would you like to meet her?

35:46.375 --> 35:47.598
Your...

35:47.598 --> 35:49.613
- your mother?
- Yeah.

35:49.613 --> 35:51.715
I told her all about you.

35:51.715 --> 35:54.465
Come on, I live right upstairs.

35:54.971 --> 35:56.264
Let's go.

35:57.149 --> 35:58.609
Your, your mom.

35:58.609 --> 35:59.601
Yeah.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.822
Here's the report on the murder weapon.

36:02.822 --> 36:06.587
You know, the firing pin was worn down.
That's why it wouldn't fire.

36:08.295 --> 36:10.211
Maybe we should call Monk in
on this one.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.530
Oh, yeah, I already called him.

36:11.530 --> 36:12.865
He's not available.

36:12.865 --> 36:16.173
He's having some kind
of problem with Hal.

36:16.835 --> 36:18.455
Hal.

36:18.681 --> 36:21.649
I still can't figure that one out.

36:28.428 --> 36:31.484
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

36:39.807 --> 36:41.487
No.

36:42.132 --> 36:44.499
When you showed this gun
to Hal and said,

36:44.499 --> 36:45.731
"here's the murder weapon,"

36:45.731 --> 36:47.962
he knew that the killer
used it like a club.

36:47.962 --> 36:49.592
That's right, he pointed to
the cracked handle.

36:49.592 --> 36:52.108
But we never told him
how Tim Hayden died.

36:52.108 --> 36:54.722
You show anybody a handgun and say,
"this is the murder weapon,"

36:54.722 --> 36:57.223
they're gonna assume
that the guy had been shot.

36:57.223 --> 36:59.509
- How did he know?
- How did he know?

37:12.402 --> 37:13.652
Wow.

37:14.861 --> 37:17.916
What a great apartment!

37:19.260 --> 37:21.272
Wait, wait, wait.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.322
I just wanna soak it in.

37:23.322 --> 37:25.601
Yeah, you soak it in.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.108
What are you doing?

37:29.779 --> 37:33.310
All these windows.
It feels like a fishbowl.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.173
So is this your mother?

37:36.211 --> 37:38.902
- Yeah.
- And this is your sister?

37:39.220 --> 37:40.774
I don't know.

37:46.317 --> 37:47.832
I know that song.

37:48.780 --> 37:51.249
- What song?
- That song you're humming.

37:51.249 --> 37:55.547
The music box at Gail Segalis'...

37:55.547 --> 37:57.487
house.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.003
You...

38:01.003 --> 38:03.204
You've been to Greece?

38:03.204 --> 38:04.708
Many times.

38:04.708 --> 38:06.678
I've been everywhere.

38:06.678 --> 38:08.438
You had a beard.

38:11.045 --> 38:12.999
Gail Segalis.

38:13.886 --> 38:18.588
She said she'd send me
a picture from Greece.

38:18.837 --> 38:21.090
Is that why...

38:21.090 --> 38:23.448
you kept coming over?

38:25.488 --> 38:28.209
She must've taken the picture.

38:28.209 --> 38:30.912
And you were in it.

38:30.912 --> 38:34.859
It would've connected you to Gail,
oh, god.

38:34.859 --> 38:37.956
You kept bringing in my mail all that time.

38:37.956 --> 38:40.995
You were just waiting for her letter.

38:40.995 --> 38:44.159
First class, my ass.
That thing took forever.

38:44.159 --> 38:45.706
So...

38:46.230 --> 38:48.530
you never really...

38:48.530 --> 38:49.620
liked me?

38:49.620 --> 38:51.123
Are you kidding?

38:51.123 --> 38:53.820
Spending a day with you
is like pulling teeth.

38:53.820 --> 38:56.777
I'm surprised your own shadow
keeps you company.

38:57.153 --> 38:58.058
No.

39:00.349 --> 39:01.549
Back up!

39:01.754 --> 39:03.603
Back up! Over there.

39:03.892 --> 39:04.982
There.

39:07.017 --> 39:09.631
Open the bottle. Open it.

39:12.604 --> 39:14.043
Open it!

39:16.596 --> 39:18.021
Stolen.

39:18.021 --> 39:19.915
Of course.

39:20.208 --> 39:21.783
You have a record.

39:21.783 --> 39:23.860
You knew you'd be searched
at the airport.

39:23.860 --> 39:29.000
That's why you seduced Gail Segalis,
to get that through customs.

39:30.751 --> 39:33.775
And then you seduced me.

39:33.775 --> 39:35.393
Come on, Adge.

39:35.393 --> 39:37.430
I was just joking.

39:37.430 --> 39:39.017
You know, I was punking you.

39:39.017 --> 39:42.661
Punk, punking?

39:42.661 --> 39:45.797
Yeah. I was joking.

39:45.797 --> 39:48.286
That gun's not loaded.

39:48.286 --> 39:52.103
I mean, I was just goofing around.
It's...

39:52.103 --> 39:55.224
it's what best friends do.

39:57.499 --> 39:59.998
- Best friends?
- Yeah.

40:03.856 --> 40:05.894
I don't believe you.

40:05.894 --> 40:07.455
Oh, come on.

40:07.455 --> 40:10.402
It's me. Hal.

40:10.402 --> 40:13.050
It's your old pal Hal.

40:13.050 --> 40:16.490
You know me.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.

40:17.394 --> 40:18.849
Come on.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.176
Let's go over to your place.

40:22.176 --> 40:23.961
Let's order a pizza.

40:23.961 --> 40:26.308
Have it sliced ten ways.

40:26.308 --> 40:28.452
- Maybe polish some rocks.
- Okay.

40:28.452 --> 40:29.427
Okay.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.530
But I'm gonna need that gun.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.148
Hands up, you freak.

40:36.353 --> 40:38.026
So it really is loaded?

40:38.026 --> 40:39.059
Yes.

40:39.644 --> 40:42.338
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun now!

40:42.538 --> 40:44.461
Step away from my friend.

40:46.419 --> 40:48.948
Turn around.
Against the wall.

40:59.271 --> 41:00.777
You okay?

41:06.759 --> 41:10.457
Uh, I'll take Pearl Jam.
Good seats?

41:10.457 --> 41:13.381
No, I'm sorry.
They're right next to the stage.

41:13.381 --> 41:17.249
Okay, that leaves Disney on ice
and women's volleyball.

41:17.249 --> 41:18.835
I'll take women's volleyball.

41:18.835 --> 41:21.386
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

41:21.749 --> 41:23.351
Okay.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.757
Hey. Wanna go?

41:28.870 --> 41:31.732
With you? Me and you?
Why?

41:31.732 --> 41:35.114
We don't need a reason.
We're friends.

41:35.667 --> 41:36.712
Okay.

41:36.712 --> 41:38.661
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

41:38.661 --> 41:40.955
Listen, can we invite Hal,
I mean, if he makes bail?

41:40.955 --> 41:42.577
Mr. Monk, he tried to kill you.

41:42.577 --> 41:43.845
No friendship is perfect.

41:43.845 --> 41:45.507
Mr. Monk, he murdered two people.

41:45.507 --> 41:47.100
All right, I'll sit between you.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.318
- You don't even have to talk to him.
- No, forget it.

41:49.318 --> 41:52.774
Natalie. I'm punking you.
That's what friends do.

41:52.774 --> 41:55.068
They punk each other.
It's fun, isn't it?

41:55.068 --> 41:57.174
Now you see if you can punk me.

41:57.174 --> 41:59.034
- You have a smudge.
- That's not funny.

41:59.034 --> 42:00.562
Don't, don't. Come on.
