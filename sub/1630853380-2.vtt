00:22.320 --> 00:24.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
dare to dream...

00:24.000 --> 00:25.520
Ladies and gentlemen,
dare to dream...

00:26.600 --> 00:31.920
..that the dawn is breaking
on an independent United Kingdom!

00:31.960 --> 00:32.000
This morning, the city mourns
the loss of yet another trader.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.840
This morning, the city mourns
the loss of yet another trader.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.040
New York London Bank's
senior analyst, Kalim Chowdhrey,

00:39.080 --> 00:40.000
was found murdered in a hate crime

00:40.000 --> 00:41.080
was found murdered in a hate crime

00:41.120 --> 00:43.960
that has sent shock waves
through the city and beyond.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.960
..shock waves through the city...

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm the scalp?
I have no choice.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.720
Yeah, you have a choice.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.000
Chris, who took Kalim's stuff?

01:52.000 --> 01:52.040
Chris, who took Kalim's stuff?

01:53.120 --> 01:55.760
It's part of the police
investigation.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.520
It's nothing for you to worry about.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.000
You wouldn't...happen to know where
his journal went to, would you?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.640
You wouldn't...happen to know where
his journal went to, would you?

02:04.080 --> 02:07.760
The police couldn't find it.
No idea.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.520
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.000
You're late.

02:40.000 --> 02:40.760
You're late.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.280
I'll do the egg white omelette,
tomatoes and mushrooms.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.360
You?
Water.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.000
Self-abnegation.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.120
Self-abnegation.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.880
Not even a little crust of bread?
You've got ten minutes.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.000
Kalim's death
was not some random hate crime.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.840
Kalim's death
was not some random hate crime.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.000
But I think you know that.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.840
But I think you know that.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.760
He was desperate to impress you
with that contact tracing deal.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
How do you know about that?

03:13.240 --> 03:15.200
It's true, isn't it?

03:15.240 --> 03:16.440
What if it is?

03:16.480 --> 03:19.720
Maybe he wasn't the only one
who understood its significance.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.640
Maybe your friends
in the East did too.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.000
So the Chinese killed Kalim
because of an app?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.040
So the Chinese killed Kalim
because of an app?

03:29.080 --> 03:32.720
If there's an epidemic
that turns into a pandemic,

03:32.760 --> 03:34.920
that app could be worth billions.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.000
If, yes.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.280
If, yes.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.400
He knew something about the app
they didn't want him to know.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.600
You're shameless.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.000
Trying to use Kalim's death
to turn me against the bank.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.280
Trying to use Kalim's death
to turn me against the bank.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.440
If they did kill Kalim,

03:50.480 --> 03:52.000
will they stop there?

03:52.000 --> 03:52.480
will they stop there?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.000
Obama says
trade with China has doubled,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.080
Obama says
trade with China has doubled,

04:57.120 --> 05:00.400
supporting a million US jobs and
has made the world a safer place.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.000
If they did kill Kalim,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.240
If they did kill Kalim,

05:06.280 --> 05:08.280
will they stop there?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.480
Massimo.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.760
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.000
We're all really upset.
Thank you.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.200
We're all really upset.
Thank you.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.640
I know we're all in shock.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.000
The bank has grief counselling
for anyone who needs it.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.240
The bank has grief counselling
for anyone who needs it.

05:37.480 --> 05:41.240
If any reporters call, please
direct them to Public Relations.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.200
See you at the service.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.000
Well, at least you don't have to
cut Kalim any more.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.160
Well, at least you don't have to
cut Kalim any more.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.000
Everyone's crying out there.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.600
Everyone's crying out there.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.880
How are you holding up?

06:23.160 --> 06:24.000
What's this?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.040
What's this?

06:25.080 --> 06:28.160
From Kalim, just before he died.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.040
'13-76-59, stop.'

06:31.080 --> 06:32.000
What does it mean?

06:32.000 --> 06:32.480
What does it mean?

06:32.520 --> 06:34.720
I don't know,
but I want to find out.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.080
The police said Kalim died
in a random attack.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.000
Maybe. Or maybe not.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.640
Maybe. Or maybe not.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.960
They emptied out
his desk this morning.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.200
Who's they?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.000
Chris Bailey said it was the police.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.240
Chris Bailey said it was the police.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.440
OK.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.000
I want you to look at that contact
tracing app Kalim was talking about.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.560
I want you to look at that contact
tracing app Kalim was talking about.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.640
OK, what am I looking for?
I don't know.

07:00.680 --> 07:04.000
Something wrong.
Something worth killing for.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.080
Something wrong.
Something worth killing for.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.520
Massimo.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.280
You're making huge leaps here.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.000
These six digits,
they could be a sort code.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.720
These six digits,
they could be a sort code.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.960
I already checked.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.320
There's no bank with that sort code,

07:16.360 --> 07:18.560
no account numbers,
no transactions, nothing.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.000
Maybe it's the combination
to a locker at a gym?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.640
Maybe it's the combination
to a locker at a gym?

07:22.680 --> 07:25.800
Kalim at a gym?

07:25.840 --> 07:28.000
Maybe it's the combination
to a safe.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.560
Maybe it's the combination
to a safe.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.000
What time did you get here?

08:00.000 --> 08:00.040
What time did you get here?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.240
I didn't.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.920
You slept here?
I didn't sleep.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.120
I appreciate your hard work,
but from now on...

08:14.320 --> 08:15.880
..go home.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.360
963.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.720
15.1.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.880
22.5.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.400
4.3.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.520
Bill Russell?

08:26.560 --> 08:29.560
963 games with the Boston Celtics.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.000
15.1 points.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.520
15.1 points.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.840
22.5 rebounds.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.520
4.3 assists per game.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.880
I didn't know
you were a basketball fan.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.160
He was your favourite player.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
And John's.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.000
It doesn't make sense.
What?

08:53.040 --> 08:55.680
There were players
with better statistics,

08:55.720 --> 08:56.000
but Russell won
more championships than anyone else.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.560
but Russell won
more championships than anyone else.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.640
Basketball is a team sport

09:00.680 --> 09:02.840
and the numbers
don't tell you everything.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.400
Mr Morgan? Ms Farmer.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.600
I came right away.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.760
Let's talk in here. Excuse me.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.000
I don't know
exactly what to say.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.720
I don't know
exactly what to say.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.160
He was our friend.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.160
I'm going to miss him so much.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.000
So much.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.040
So much.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.760
We'll figure it out.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Paul.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.040
Paul.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.000
Stay there.
Didn't expect to see you here.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.320
Yeah, well... Kept in touch.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.000
Poor old bugger,
I'm going to miss him.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.440
Poor old bugger,
I'm going to miss him.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.440
Yeah. How have you been?

11:01.480 --> 11:03.680
Working at another bank, doing fine.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.000
No thanks to some people.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.720
No thanks to some people.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.200
"Paul, what the fuck!"
Anyway, I'll see you inside.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.120
You still there?

11:11.160 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, I told you, yes.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.200
Yeah, I told you, yes.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.680
Amina.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.000
I can't talk to you right now.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.960
I can't talk to you right now.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.920
I'm so sorry.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.000
He was your friend, he loved you.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.360
He was your friend, he loved you.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.760
And I loved him.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.320
But nothing he did
was good enough, was it?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.920
You made him feel
like a failure, Massimo.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.960
Massimo.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.680
Hi.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.160
It's good to see you, mate.
You too.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.520
What's that on your phone?
Just some new filter.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.000
New filter? Let's take a photo.
Sure.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.680
New filter? Let's take a photo.
Sure.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.680
OK.
I think you've captured the real me.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.960
Well... Can you show me
where's the bathroom?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.160
Sure, it's up here.
Thank you, let's go.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.000
Here you go.
Thank you, mate.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.400
Here you go.
Thank you, mate.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.440
Are you trying to open that?

12:56.800 --> 13:00.080
I... I was, but I don't have
the combination.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.960
I need papers for the bank and
I didn't want to bother your mum.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Sure, I know it, it's my birthday.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.640
Sure, I know it, it's my birthday.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.320
25, 04, 05.
Thank you.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.800
Amina?

13:34.840 --> 13:36.000
Sorry, I know
this isn't a good time, but...

13:36.000 --> 13:37.240
Sorry, I know
this isn't a good time, but...

13:37.280 --> 13:40.600
Kalim kept a journal.
We haven't been able to find it.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.000
I think I know where it might be.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.160
I think I know where it might be.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.400
Would you mind?
Not at all.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.920
Thank you.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.840
I'm sorry,
the other one was occupied.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.960
Well?
They're written in Urdu.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.960
We need a translator.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.440
Did you get it?

15:51.520 --> 15:52.000
Tough day.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.640
Tough day.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.680
You look like
you could use one of these.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.840
Yes.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.040
I heard what Kalim's wife
said to you at the reception.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.840
Yeah, well... Maybe she was right.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.000
I wasn't a very good friend.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.080
I wasn't a very good friend.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.840
Well...

16:12.880 --> 16:14.880
I knew how much he admired you.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.160
Even though you're an asshole.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.520
No wonder you have no friends.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.000
I'm not sure I know
what being a friend means any more.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.320
I'm not sure I know
what being a friend means any more.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.520
I'm sorry.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.960
To Kalim.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.120
I'm here if you need me.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
Hey.
Hey.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.880
How was Kalim's service?

17:41.920 --> 17:44.000
Sad.
Sorry I missed it.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.840
Sad.
Sorry I missed it.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.040
Yeah, I'm sorry
you had to work a double shift.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.000
It's bedlam down there.

17:52.000 --> 17:52.160
It's bedlam down there.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.200
All the cutbacks.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.320
People are waiting hours
just to see a nurse.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.160
What are you doing?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.440
I'm looking
into something for Massimo.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.000
I don't know what I'm going
to tell him if I get this job.

18:08.000 --> 18:08.240
I don't know what I'm going
to tell him if I get this job.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.840
Oliver, if Massimo is really
your friend, he'll be happy for you.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.960
He counts on me, Toy,
and now with Kalim gone -

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah, but we count on you too.

18:16.000 --> 18:16.440
Yeah, but we count on you too.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.640
Massimo's been good to you,
but you need to be good to yourself.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.000
You deserve to succeed.
Can you stop pushing me?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Am I pushing you?
Yeah, a little.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.200
Am I pushing you?
Yeah, a little.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.200
Look...

18:28.240 --> 18:31.560
I get it, right? I'll call tomorrow.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.480
Promise.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.000
Good.
OK.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.040
Now come on, let's get to bed.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.000
I'm not tired.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.120
I'm not tired.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.160
Neither am I.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.680
Hi.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.000
Mario.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.400
Mario.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.000
Massimo.
Hey, mate.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.800
Massimo.
Hey, mate.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.240
Hi.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.280
Can you tell me what does it mean?

19:22.200 --> 19:25.000
The Chinese government
continues to invest heavily

19:25.040 --> 19:27.000
in identified technologies.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.000
AI is quoted as an entity
that cannot be defeated.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.760
AI is quoted as an entity
that cannot be defeated.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.000
You got the translation?
Yes.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.240
You got the translation?
Yes.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.040
These are just notes about the app.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.000
There's one thing
that doesn't make sense.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.680
There's one thing
that doesn't make sense.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.720
He keeps writing the word 'kahani'.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.280
And what does it mean?

19:50.320 --> 19:52.000
It's Urdu for story
or narrative or fib.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.480
It's Urdu for story
or narrative or fib.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.880
He wrote it several times,
out of context.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.000
I don't know why Liwei wants this.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.360
I don't know why Liwei wants this.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.040
Yeah, I'll go and check out
that contact tracing firm.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.080
See if they know what it means.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.680
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.720
Massimo. Problem.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.000
This video is deeply disturbing.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.920
This video is deeply disturbing.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.400
If proven, we must take
these charges very seriously.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.000
The leaked video would seem to show

20:24.000 --> 20:24.440
The leaked video would seem to show

20:24.480 --> 20:28.000
Chinese businessman Theodore Huang
meeting with Iranian mullahs

20:28.040 --> 20:31.320
in 2014, in flagrant violation
of the UN embargo.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.000
In flagrant violation...

20:32.000 --> 20:34.760
In flagrant violation...

20:34.800 --> 20:35.920
Oh, shit.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.640
We're going
to lose Ellams Automotive.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.000
And our commission.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.000
We need to stop
the FCA acting against us.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.440
We need to stop
the FCA acting against us.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.600
I'll tell Lord Buckner
we need a meeting.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.600
We're in trouble.
I wouldn't be so sure about it.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.000
Why not?
You know Massimo.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.520
Why not?
You know Massimo.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.320
He always finds some magic trick
at the last minute.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.840
Hello, this is Eleanor Bourg

20:55.880 --> 20:56.000
from New York London
Investment Bank.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.920
from New York London
Investment Bank.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.760
I'd like to speak with Lord Buckner
if it's possible.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.160
What are you doing here?
Lord Buckner is waiting to see you.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.000
I don't think
you'll like what he has to say.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.160
I don't think
you'll like what he has to say.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.960
You leaked the video.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
I told you, Massimo, we are at war
and you are on the wrong side.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.600
I told you, Massimo, we are at war
and you are on the wrong side.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.320
Where did you get it from?

21:42.360 --> 21:44.000
I don't remember incriminating
videos being part of your playbook.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.080
I don't remember incriminating
videos being part of your playbook.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.320
Daunt Tolliver's deal
is still on the table.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.000
You could help Ellams Automotive
to stay out of Chinese hands.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.480
You could help Ellams Automotive
to stay out of Chinese hands.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.840
And put it in yours? No, thanks.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.000
Yes, inmate 47834. Dominic Morgan.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.680
Yes, inmate 47834. Dominic Morgan.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.000
Kalim was so interested
in that software,

22:16.000 --> 22:16.120
Kalim was so interested
in that software,

22:16.160 --> 22:18.520
and then all of a sudden...zip.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.800
I thought NYL
had forgotten all about us.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.000
"Data collection is vital
to preserving public health.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.160
"Data collection is vital
to preserving public health.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.680
In the event
of a widespread viral outbreak,

22:26.720 --> 22:29.400
your mobile phone's Bluetooth
and location services

22:29.440 --> 22:31.400
monitor your whereabouts.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.000
If you've been near anyone else
who's tested positive for the virus,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.720
If you've been near anyone else
who's tested positive for the virus,

22:34.760 --> 22:36.640
a text is sent to your device,

22:36.680 --> 22:39.200
telling you to isolate yourself
and get tested."

22:39.240 --> 22:40.000
I've never even
heard of contact tracing.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.240
I've never even
heard of contact tracing.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.600
Not many people have.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.720
But we believe this app
could save millions of lives.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.760
Now, Kalim wrote
a word in Urdu about your app.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.000
Hm.
Kahani. It means story in English.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.440
Hm.
Kahani. It means story in English.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.040
Story?
Story, yeah, narrative.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.720
Could be a code word.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.720
Does that mean anything to you?
No, not particularly.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.000
Should it?
No.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.600
Should it?
No.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.320
No. Thanks.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.440
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.920
We're confirmed for dinner

23:24.960 --> 23:27.440
with that team from
the social media app, Flamestar.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.000
I've met their CEO, Pietro Marchesi.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.720
I've met their CEO, Pietro Marchesi.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.280
He's a flirt.
So are you.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.680
Gentlemen.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.960
Massimo, I understand
you went to see Lord Buckner.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Dominic Morgan got to him first.

23:52.040 --> 23:55.040
The FCA won't allow
Huang Capital to trade.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.040
Where does that leave
Ellams Automotive?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.960
We still have an offer
from Daunt Tolliver.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
We're not taking it.
Why not?

24:00.000 --> 24:00.880
We're not taking it.
Why not?

24:00.920 --> 24:04.880
Daunt Tolliver is a puppet investor,
manipulated by Dominic Morgan.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.200
Massimo,
I don't think I need to tell you

24:11.240 --> 24:13.840
that you can't afford to lose
Ellams Automotive.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.880
You're right, Jeremy.
You don't need to tell me.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.000
Massimo.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.040
Massimo.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.200
May I have a word?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I'm the one who brought
Theodore Huang to the bank.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.600
I'm the one who brought
Theodore Huang to the bank.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.920
I hope you know that
that kind of behaviour

24:34.960 --> 24:38.120
doesn't represent my country's
government or its aspirations.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.200
Of course.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.000
And I want you to know that you
still have my full confidence.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.560
And I want you to know that you
still have my full confidence.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.280
I appreciate it.
Good luck.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.000
Thank you.

24:48.000 --> 24:48.560
Thank you.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.160
Mr Ellams?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.000
We can't proceed with Huang Capital,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.240
We can't proceed with Huang Capital,

24:57.280 --> 24:59.160
so that leaves us
with Daunt Tolliver.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.360
The offer's not
large enough, for one.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.000
And you don't know what
they want to do with your company.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.040
And you don't know what
they want to do with your company.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.640
Could it be any worse
than what the Chinese would do?

25:07.680 --> 25:09.800
Full disclosure, Mr Ruggero.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.000
I've been approached
by another firm.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.640
I've been approached
by another firm.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.680
They say you should never
have put us in this position.

25:15.720 --> 25:19.160
Give me 24 hours and I'll get you
a better deal than you had before.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.920
24 hours, but t-then
I-I'm going with someone else.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.000
I swear, she hasn't
changed her clothes once.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.800
I swear, she hasn't
changed her clothes once.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.960
I heard every word you said.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.920
And I'm sure Nadya did too.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.280
I expect a sincere apology.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.440
Understood?
Of course, Mr Morgan.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.040
Carolina, you look stunning.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.000
It's 2016, Dominic.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.560
It's 2016, Dominic.

27:28.600 --> 27:32.320
You don't talk about how a woman
looks at a business dinner.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.480
You're not just any woman.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.000
And this isn't just business.
So it's flattery, is it?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.560
And this isn't just business.
So it's flattery, is it?

27:37.600 --> 27:41.280
You want something.
50 billion dollars, to be exact.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.560
That's getting right to the point.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.000
My pockets
aren't anywhere near that deep.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.680
My pockets
aren't anywhere near that deep.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.640
They don't need to be.

27:48.680 --> 27:49.800
You invest.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.000
All your friends
in Silicon Valley will follow.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.480
All your friends
in Silicon Valley will follow.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.640
Invest in what, exactly?

27:55.680 --> 27:57.800
A special purpose
acquisition company.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.960
And its special purpose is?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.080
I want to acquire
the best data, technology,

28:02.120 --> 28:05.120
and artificial intelligence
companies in the world

28:05.160 --> 28:08.000
and keep them
from falling into Chinese hands.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.160
and keep them
from falling into Chinese hands.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.200
Sounding a nationalist tone, are we?

28:12.240 --> 28:15.480
Not so long ago, you were helping
to build Chinamerica.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.000
Times change.
Not for me.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.680
Times change.
Not for me.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.760
Chinese manufacturing
is still giving me

28:19.800 --> 28:21.680
a healthy return on my investment.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.000
Thank you very much.
You're filthy rich, Carolina.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.800
Thank you very much.
You're filthy rich, Carolina.

28:24.840 --> 28:28.680
And this SPAC
will make you even filthier.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.000
I love it when you talk dirty.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.400
I love it when you talk dirty.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.720
And I'll consider
your proposal very seriously.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.000
But first, I'd like
a very cold, very tall, dry Martini.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.440
But first, I'd like
a very cold, very tall, dry Martini.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.880
Dry Martinis.
Thank you.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.640
Thank you very much.

28:55.680 --> 28:56.000
I like a woman who drinks.
And I like a man who pays.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.040
I like a woman who drinks.
And I like a man who pays.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.880
But the bill's on us tonight.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.000
It will take more than dinner
to get us to sell.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.400
It will take more than dinner
to get us to sell.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.800
Flamestar doesn't need the capital.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.880
Well, everyone could use
extra money, Signor Marchesi.

29:11.920 --> 29:12.000
And our client has a lot of it.
Yes, but your investor is Chinese.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.640
And our client has a lot of it.
Yes, but your investor is Chinese.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.360
Green or red, all money spends.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.000
Perhaps, but some of
my investors aren't comfortable.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.320
Perhaps, but some of
my investors aren't comfortable.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.360
Haven't you read the news?
The world is flat.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.000
Yes, so they say.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.480
Yes, so they say.

29:28.520 --> 29:32.440
Competition is good for business
and we're good partners.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.000
Who can make your investors
a lot of money.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.360
Who can make your investors
a lot of money.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.640
I'll drink to that.
Cheers.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.560
Hey, babe.
Hey.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.000
Who's that?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.480
Who's that?

29:55.840 --> 29:58.680
Massimo.
Something wrong?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.000
He just wants my help
with something.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.720
He just wants my help
with something.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.120
And? Are you being helpful?

30:04.160 --> 30:06.840
Not really.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.000
How did it go at Durings?

30:08.000 --> 30:09.480
How did it go at Durings?

30:09.520 --> 30:12.400
OK, I think.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.440
They were a bit poker-faced.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.000
Well, you're brilliant.
They had to have seen that. Hm.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.120
Well, you're brilliant.
They had to have seen that. Hm.

30:18.160 --> 30:21.080
Uh-uh. Mm!

30:26.920 --> 30:30.520
..possible diplomatic...

30:40.440 --> 30:43.080
You know, this is for tomorrow.
Thanks.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.000
Yeah.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.320
Yeah.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.800
Wow.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.080
OK.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.000
OK, let's do it again.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.120
OK, let's do it again.

32:59.720 --> 33:02.840
How... How do you say
your name properly?

33:04.320 --> 33:06.040
In Chinese?
Yes.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.920
Zhi.
Oh.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.000
It means...

33:12.000 --> 33:12.280
It means...

33:13.480 --> 33:16.400
..will or purpose.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.520
It's actually a boy's name.
Oh, yeah?

33:18.560 --> 33:20.000
Yeah, where I grew up,
you could only have one child.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.080
Yeah, where I grew up,
you could only have one child.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.280
Everybody wanted a boy.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.840
Women would terminate
their pregnancies

33:26.880 --> 33:28.000
if they found out it was a girl.

33:28.000 --> 33:28.880
if they found out it was a girl.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.920
Well, you made it through somehow.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.000
No, I was a disappointment.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.120
No, I was a disappointment.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.440
What about you?
What was it like where you grew up?

33:43.480 --> 33:44.000
Poor.
I guess we're both overcompensating.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.040
Poor.
I guess we're both overcompensating.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.000
You sorry we did this?

33:52.000 --> 33:52.360
You sorry we did this?

33:54.320 --> 33:57.760
Are you?
You didn't answer my question.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.600
We'll keep it to ourselves.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.360
Do you hear that?
I don't hear anything.

34:33.480 --> 34:36.120
Do you know
the old Simon And Garfunkel song?

34:36.160 --> 34:39.000
I never realised what
that sound of silence really meant.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.880
Death.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.840
You look very much
alive to me, Mr Korhonen.

34:47.880 --> 34:48.000
But my business isn't.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.760
But my business isn't.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.960
Ten years ago,
these forests echoed with chainsaws.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Now the work has gone
to Japan, India, China.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.600
Now the work has gone
to Japan, India, China.

34:59.560 --> 35:04.000
Well, Metsat is still one of the
great paper producers in the world.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.200
Well, Metsat is still one of the
great paper producers in the world.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.760
But I'm aware of your challenges.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.800
Challenges?

35:09.840 --> 35:12.000
You bankers, you like euphemisms,
don't you?

35:12.000 --> 35:12.240
You bankers, you like euphemisms,
don't you?

35:14.240 --> 35:16.240
I'm here to offer you a lifeline.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.000
Like a shark,

35:23.040 --> 35:25.560
you smell distress
and see an opportunity.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.400
You still have your good name.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.000
But you don't make any money.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.840
But you don't make any money.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.920
You have to do something right now
or your company really will be dead.

35:43.960 --> 35:44.000
What's the catch?
There's no catch.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.280
What's the catch?
There's no catch.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.000
Come on.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.440
There's no such thing
as a free lunch. It's not free.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.000
Someone else will pick up the bill.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.480
Someone else will pick up the bill.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.640
I'm going to go down there
and park myself in his office.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.760
Whose office?

36:13.800 --> 36:15.800
Damian Curtis.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.000
Zhi wants me to write a report
on his Brexit polling,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.320
Zhi wants me to write a report
on his Brexit polling,

36:18.360 --> 36:20.760
but he won't pick up
the bloody phone.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.800
That's frustrating.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.000
And rude.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.840
And rude.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.000
I feel creepy
even asking this, but...

36:32.000 --> 36:32.560
I feel creepy
even asking this, but...

36:34.120 --> 36:36.120
Are you applying?

36:36.160 --> 36:38.040
For what?

36:38.080 --> 36:40.000
Kalim's job.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.080
Kalim's job.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.880
Senior analyst? No.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.600
Are you?

36:46.640 --> 36:48.000
I'd like to.

36:48.000 --> 36:48.680
I'd like to.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.640
But I think Zhi hates me.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.000
I thought you hated her.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.000
Hate, such a strong word.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.160
Hate, such a strong word.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.960
But I'm glad
the two of us aren't competing.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Me too.

37:04.000 --> 37:04.680
Me too.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.480
Hey, I hope you get it.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.960
I think Kalim
would have wanted that.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.720
Hello?

37:29.840 --> 37:31.840
Who's there?

37:39.040 --> 37:41.040
Weird.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.640
Mr Harris.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.800
Someone just called.

38:03.840 --> 38:08.000
He claims to be a consultant Kalim
used on that contact tracing app.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.000
He said he needs
to see you in person.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.440
OK.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.720
Are you sure about this?

38:17.640 --> 38:19.760
Just sent you my notes
on the dinner last night.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.640
I think it went well, don't you?
I do, thank you.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.000
I'm still waiting
for your report on the polling.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.880
I'm still waiting
for your report on the polling.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.840
Damian has been hard to reach,
but I'm working on it.

38:27.880 --> 38:28.960
Great.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.720
Eleanor.
Yes.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.920
I know you want Kalim's job.
I think I'm more than qualified.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.800
I'm not giving it to you.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.640
OK.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.480
May I ask why?

38:46.520 --> 38:48.000
You're bright and charming
and better in a client-facing role.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.440
You're bright and charming
and better in a client-facing role.

38:51.480 --> 38:54.920
So you're telling me
I'm at a dead end, career-wise.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.000
For the moment.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.960
For the moment.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.520
OK.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.480
Why meet here?

39:46.520 --> 39:49.440
It's a dead zone,
one of the last few left in London.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.000
They can't track your mobile.
Aren't you being a bit paranoid?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.160
They can't track your mobile.
Aren't you being a bit paranoid?

39:53.200 --> 39:56.400
I am, and you should be too,
after what happened to Kalim.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.000
You think someone...

40:00.000 --> 40:01.040
You think someone...

40:02.080 --> 40:03.880
Had him killed?

40:03.920 --> 40:07.040
I don't know if they did,
but I know what they're capable of.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.000
They?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.080
They?

40:10.040 --> 40:12.960
I'm from Hong Kong. Why do you think
I'm living in London?

40:16.920 --> 40:20.200
What was in that contact
tracing app that's so dangerous?

40:20.240 --> 40:21.960
The guys
who designed the app are smart,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
but they've got Chinese
plug-ins in their software.

40:24.000 --> 40:24.960
but they've got Chinese
plug-ins in their software.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.040
So?

40:26.080 --> 40:28.400
So the app is meant
to save your life in an epidemic.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.000
The Chinese would use it
to monitor everything about you.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.000
Where you go,
who you see, what you say.

40:32.000 --> 40:32.840
Where you go,
who you see, what you say.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.040
If you want an advantage
over the West,

40:36.080 --> 40:38.440
monitoring the behaviour
of its citizens is a good start.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.720
Kalim kept writing a word
in his journal.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.920
Story.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.960
It's the code name the Chinese gave
their tracking software.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Still think I'm being paranoid?

40:59.880 --> 41:01.880
Oliver?
I've been trying to reach you.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.680
Where are you?
On my way back.

41:03.720 --> 41:04.000
What is it?
There's a Mikael Korhonen here.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.360
What is it?
There's a Mikael Korhonen here.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.360
Send him to the conference room,
I'll be right there.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.000
Hey.
Hello, Mr Korhonen.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.560
Hey.
Hello, Mr Korhonen.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.600
Oliver. Nice to meet you.
How do you do?

41:15.640 --> 41:17.240
I'm well. Please.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.480
How long have you worked with
Mr Ruggero?

41:19.520 --> 41:20.000
About five years now.

41:20.000 --> 41:20.880
About five years now.

41:20.920 --> 41:24.520
I came to NYL straight out of uni.
He's very clever, isn't he?

41:24.560 --> 41:26.920
Very, he taught me
everything I know.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.000
Speaks well of him, drawing
such loyalty from his colleagues.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.360
Speaks well of him, drawing
such loyalty from his colleagues.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.560
Please.
Thank you.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.600
Mr Korhonen,
it's very nice to see you.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.280
This way, please.
Thanks.

41:43.960 --> 41:44.000
What is going on?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.960
What is going on?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.160
Magic.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.000
Good afternoon, everybody.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.600
Good afternoon, everybody.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.280
Pleased to see you.
How are you?

41:56.320 --> 41:57.600
Thank you for being here.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.000
It's my pleasure to introduce
Mikael Korhonen,

42:00.000 --> 42:00.880
It's my pleasure to introduce
Mikael Korhonen,

42:00.920 --> 42:02.920
chief executive of Metsat,

42:02.960 --> 42:06.280
Finland's oldest and largest
paper company.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.000
Today he has tendered an offer
for Ellams Automotive

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Today he has tendered an offer
for Ellams Automotive

42:10.040 --> 42:12.000
at 50 pounds a share.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.920
Thank you.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
I see what you did there.
Do you?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.120
I see what you did there.
Do you?

42:25.160 --> 42:28.120
Korhonen has no interest
in acquiring a car company.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.720
But Theodore Huang can't be seen
to invest in Ellams.

42:30.760 --> 42:31.800
Correct.

42:31.840 --> 42:32.000
So Korhonen acquires the company,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.480
So Korhonen acquires the company,

42:34.520 --> 42:36.600
with Huang coming in
as a major shareholder

42:36.640 --> 42:39.240
after the deal has cleared the FCA.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.000
Also correct.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.040
Also correct.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.080
That's brilliantly played.

42:44.880 --> 42:45.880
Thank you.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.160
Good evening, Mr Morgan.
Have a good night.

42:57.560 --> 43:00.040
Do you remember what I said
about going home?

43:01.280 --> 43:04.000
What they said about me today
was true, I am strange.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.280
What they said about me today
was true, I am strange.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.520
You're different.

43:08.560 --> 43:12.000
That doesn't make you strange.
Why did you offer me this job?

43:12.000 --> 43:12.080
That doesn't make you strange.
Why did you offer me this job?

43:13.200 --> 43:14.880
Why did you take it?

43:14.920 --> 43:17.560
I'm not qualified.
I saw your potential.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.000
You're the first person
who ever did.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.480
You're the first person
who ever did.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.840
I guess that's why.
And I'm never wrong.

43:27.560 --> 43:28.000
Come on.
Let me give you a lift home.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.360
Come on.
Let me give you a lift home.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.320
Can I help?
I want my cat.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.000
Is he here?
Big black one?

44:08.000 --> 44:08.320
Is he here?
Big black one?

44:08.360 --> 44:10.640
Edward.
Of course, just a minute.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.640
I don't know why
he keeps coming in here.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.360
OK.

44:19.360 --> 44:20.440
I'm Massimo, by the way.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.680
Izzy.
I haven't seen you before.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.000
We just moved here.
My mum moves around for her work.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.080
We just moved here.
My mum moves around for her work.

44:28.920 --> 44:31.160
I have to go.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.000
It was a pleasure.

44:32.000 --> 44:32.800
It was a pleasure.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.800
Were you expecting someone else?

44:51.840 --> 44:53.520
Not really.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.000
I thought I'd drop by
and congratulate you on Korhonen.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.280
I thought I'd drop by
and congratulate you on Korhonen.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.280
That was a masterstroke.

45:03.760 --> 45:04.000
Thank you.

45:04.000 --> 45:04.920
Thank you.

45:04.960 --> 45:08.080
You don't really think the Chinese
care about car batteries, do you?

45:09.200 --> 45:12.000
They have thousands of factories
50 times the size of Ellams.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.720
They have thousands of factories
50 times the size of Ellams.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.200
It's a way in.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.080
They're going
to use Ellams batteries

45:17.120 --> 45:19.520
to collect data
on millions of drivers.

45:19.560 --> 45:20.000
And the cancer spreads.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.760
And the cancer spreads.

45:21.800 --> 45:27.320
From cars,
to computers, to smartphones.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.240
You already said it.

45:32.280 --> 45:36.000
The Chinese didn't
acquire Ellams, Korhonen did.

45:36.000 --> 45:36.120
The Chinese didn't
acquire Ellams, Korhonen did.

45:37.880 --> 45:39.880
You're making a mistake, Massimo.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.280
You'll see that sooner or later.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.280
Carolina.

45:52.600 --> 45:56.080
Lovely to see you.
I am so glad you called.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.480
I thought you should know
what Dominic's planning,

45:58.520 --> 46:00.000
especially as it involves
the rather talented Mr Ruggero.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.640
especially as it involves
the rather talented Mr Ruggero.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.880
Thank you.

46:04.920 --> 46:07.760
I gather Massimo
hasn't said anything to you.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.000
Just that he ran into Dominic.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.520
Just that he ran into Dominic.

46:10.560 --> 46:13.280
What can I get you?
Grey Goose Martini, dry.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.000
Just plain water, thank you.
Certainly.

46:16.000 --> 46:16.760
Just plain water, thank you.
Certainly.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.880

Telling me about Dominic
and his SPAC, and Massimo...

Telling me about Dominic
and his SPAC, and Massimo...

46:26.240 --> 46:30.440
Dominic could do real damage
to your country's ambitions.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.000
Especially
if he wins over Massimo Ruggero.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.040
Especially
if he wins over Massimo Ruggero.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.680
And I could make a lot of money.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.840
I see.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.000
Unless you're prepared
to make me even more.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.400
Unless you're prepared
to make me even more.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.720
What do you have in mind?

46:54.920 --> 46:56.000
Yes!

46:56.000 --> 46:57.840
Yes!

46:59.240 --> 47:01.240
Carter, look after your brother.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.000
Hello?

47:04.000 --> 47:04.360
Hello?

47:04.400 --> 47:05.720
Yep.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.400
OK.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.000
I see.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.240
I see.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.000
Thank you.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Well?

47:20.000 --> 47:20.800
Well?

47:21.880 --> 47:24.120
Got it.
Yes!

47:49.280 --> 47:52.000
The video was helpful,
but the war isn't won.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.360
The video was helpful,
but the war isn't won.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.120
I'm going to need more help
persuading Massimo.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.880
I'm at your disposal.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.000
Xi Jinping and David Cameron
talked about a golden era in ties.

48:18.480 --> 48:19.800
What's at stake for China?

48:19.840 --> 48:21.960
If the UK decides to exit the EU...

48:22.000 --> 48:23.960
Probably Beijing
is scratching its head.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
'Why are they doing this?'
