00:06.079 --> 00:08.656
They don't have a problem with us dropping by?

00:08.657 --> 00:13.639
On the contrary. The operations foreman said
they haven't had visitors in nearly six months.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.050
Is it really a matriarchal society?
The women make all the decisions?

00:19.051 --> 00:26.642
Until recently, but in the last decade the Paraagan males
have made great strides to acquire equal rights.

00:26.643 --> 00:30.446
Still, it would probably be best
if we didn't get too flirtatious.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.187
Probably.

00:33.188 --> 00:37.126
I read that this colony started off 20 years ago with just 30 miners.

00:37.127 --> 00:38.855
Now there are over 3,000.

00:38.856 --> 00:43.091
They've got schools, landscaped communities even some kind of museum.

00:43.092 --> 00:47.327
You think 20 years from now there'll be Earth colonies out this far?

00:47.328 --> 00:51.412
Human kids growing up on New Sausalito?

00:51.413 --> 00:54.989
If my father were alive he wouldn't doubt it for a minute.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.685
- We're making history with...
- Every light year.

00:57.686 --> 01:01.680
You know, I think I've heard
you say that at least half a dozen times.

01:04.485 --> 01:05.684
Archer here.

01:05.685 --> 01:08.490
The Paraagans have given us clearance to enter orbit.

01:08.491 --> 01:11.492
Have you received their landing protocols?

01:11.493 --> 01:14.494
- They're coming in now.
- We're on our way.

01:25.207 --> 01:31.258
- This should take a bit longer than usual.
- It wouldn't be very polite to ignite their atmosphere.

01:31.259 --> 01:38.400
- When are you supposed to close the plasma ducts?
- The protocol said 50 kilometers, but to be on the safe side

01:38.401 --> 01:43.184
I'm going to lock them off at about 75.

01:43.185 --> 01:49.774
Although the matriarchal elements in the culture have diminished, it might be best if I were to ask...

02:03.430 --> 02:07.548
Song : "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road

02:07.549 --> 02:10.501
ENTERPRISE
Getting from there to here

02:10.502 --> 02:14.208
ENTERPRISE
It's been a long time

02:14.209 --> 02:18.039
But my time is finally near

02:18.040 --> 02:22.309
And I will see my dream come alive at last

02:22.310 --> 02:25.546
Based upon "STAR TREK" by Gene Roddenberry
I will touch the sky

02:25.547 --> 02:29.254
And they're not gonna hold me down no more

02:29.255 --> 02:33.180
Scott Bakula as Capt Janathan Archer 
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:33.181 --> 02:37.105

'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:37.106 --> 02:39.839

I've got faith to believe

026 [1x26] Shockwave I
I closed both plasma ducts. I'm certain of it.

03:25.053 --> 03:29.949
- Are you sure there's nothing left?
- We could see the colony in full magnification, sir.

03:29.950 --> 03:34.669
The ground was scorched for at least a hundred kilometers in every direction.

03:34.670 --> 03:39.389
- Could one of the dampeners been malfunctioning?
- I closed both ducts.

03:39.390 --> 03:42.413
Any kind of malfunction would have triggered an alarm. Two alarms.

03:42.414 --> 03:46.208
There are backups to prevent these kinds of accidents. The ducts were closed.

03:46.209 --> 03:51.225
This is no time to be placing blame.
A thorough investigation should explain what happened.

03:51.226 --> 03:54.409
- How is he?
- He has a mild concussion, but he should be fine.

03:54.410 --> 03:59.013
Have you tried hailing the colony?
There has to be someone down there.

03:59.014 --> 04:04.199
Sir, I tried to explain. There's nothing left.
No buildings, no trees, no people.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.336
That's impossible. There were 3,600 colonists.

04:18.173 --> 04:23.014
- Have you finished the diagnostics?
- I've analyzed six of the pod sensor logs. I have two left.

04:23.015 --> 04:26.339
Well, get them done. You've had three hours.

04:26.340 --> 04:28.350
What about the Enterprise sensor logs?

04:28.351 --> 04:31.308
They must have recorded how much tetrazine was in the atmosphere.

04:31.309 --> 04:34.525
Was the concentration greater than the Paraagans specified?

04:34.526 --> 04:37.610
Was it present at higher altitudes 
than it was supposed to be?

04:37.611 --> 04:41.625
That's the weird part, sir. The tetrazine levels were less than three parts per million.

04:41.626 --> 04:45.539
That's half what the protocol specified.

04:45.540 --> 04:50.570
- What about the point of ignition?
- The flash point was directly beneath the shuttle, sir.

04:50.571 --> 04:55.647
But it seems to have originated at the starboard plasma duct.

04:55.648 --> 04:58.868
A plasma duct you're certain was closed.

04:58.869 --> 05:03.559
Every log on the shuttle indicates 
that both ducts were sealed and locked.

05:03.560 --> 05:08.109
Then you'd better start reexamining those logs...

05:08.110 --> 05:12.926
because something doesn't add up here.

05:12.927 --> 05:18.213
Get me Admiral Forrest.
This is not going to be fun.

05:19.282 --> 05:21.028
Tetrazine?

05:21.029 --> 05:24.040
It's a by-product of their mining operation.

05:24.041 --> 05:28.220
It settles between 45 and 50 kilometers in their atmosphere.

05:28.221 --> 05:32.400
Exhaust plasma is about the only thing hot enough to ignite it.

05:32.401 --> 05:35.987
- But you said your plasma ducts were closed.
- Yes, sir.

05:35.988 --> 05:39.572
We're doing everything we can to determine what went wrong

05:39.573 --> 05:44.766
but that's not going to change the fact
that there are 3,600 corpses down there.

05:44.767 --> 05:48.082
Continue to analyze your logs.

05:48.083 --> 05:51.423
I'm going to call an emergency meeting of the Command Council.

05:51.424 --> 05:54.763
You realize they'll undoubtedly bring the Vulcans into this

05:54.764 --> 05:58.561
and they'll have to figure out
who's going to contact the Paraagan homeworld.

05:58.562 --> 06:03.535
That should be my responsibility, sir.
You're right, it should...

06:03.536 --> 06:07.311
but let's take this one step at a time.

06:07.312 --> 06:11.086
How do you tell all those families that...?

06:11.087 --> 06:13.414
You followed all the protocols 
that you were given.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.877
We came here to meet these people.

06:15.878 --> 06:18.039
To learn something about them, not to kill them.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.838
You followed the protocols.

06:21.839 --> 06:27.292
You've got a crew that's going to be looking to you 
to figure out how to react to all this.

06:27.293 --> 06:32.821
Don't let them down.
I'll get back to you soon as I can.

06:32.822 --> 06:35.707
I'm sorry, Jon.

06:42.109 --> 06:45.626
His behavior has been erratic.

06:45.627 --> 06:51.198
He seems to alternate between agitation, 
despondency and guilt.

06:51.199 --> 06:55.754
He spends most of his time alone.
I've tried to remind him that this was an accident

06:55.755 --> 07:04.177
but his responses have been illogical.
He seems to be ignoring his responsibilities as captain.

07:04.178 --> 07:07.904
Ah, to be Vulcan.

07:10.699 --> 07:17.327
It's been my experience that humans have a great deal of difficulty
separating emotional despair from what you call responsibility.

07:17.328 --> 07:24.519
Nevertheless, as his physician you should monitor him closely
to be certain he remains fit for command.

07:24.520 --> 07:29.898
I understand how, um, uncomfortable 
his behavior must be for you,

07:29.899 --> 07:37.373
but... trust me it would be unnatural for the Captain 
not to be affected by grief under these circumstances.

07:37.374 --> 07:42.701
It's, uh... human nature.
He'll be fine.

08:00.159 --> 08:01.451
What is it?

08:01.452 --> 08:04.488
It's Admiral Forrest, sir.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.354
Thank you.

08:20.446 --> 08:23.109
The atmospheric analysis of the probe is coming through.

08:23.110 --> 08:25.423
Put it up here, would you?

08:31.650 --> 08:32.961
What is it?

08:32.962 --> 08:36.657
The air near the surface is filled with traces of borocarbons.

08:36.658 --> 08:41.253
When tetrazine is ignited by plasma exhaust
there's only one outcome you can be sure of.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.078
- Traces of borocarbons.
- You got it.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.518
I don't care whether that probe picked up traces of bread pudding.

08:47.519 --> 08:51.904
Both our plasma ducts were locked down 
and there were no leaks in the system.

08:51.905 --> 08:55.247
Not unless they miraculously mended themselves afterwards.

08:59.652 --> 09:05.960
T'Pol...Trip.

09:10.327 --> 09:16.133
- The mission's been canceled.
- Canceled?!

09:16.134 --> 09:22.060
From what the Admiral tells me Ambassador Soval will use this to convince Starfleet...

09:22.061 --> 09:26.559
that we need another 10 or 20 years 
before we try this again.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.569
20 years?!

09:29.570 --> 09:35.827
- Starfleet won't buy that for a minute.
- Won't they?

09:35.828 --> 09:41.910
Tell him he's crazy! 
Tell him that's guilt talking, not Jonathan Archer!

09:41.911 --> 09:45.450
The Vulcan ship will meet us in three days
to get you and Dr. Phlox.

09:45.451 --> 09:51.432
Please inform Mr. Mayweather to... 
head for these coordinates.

09:53.310 --> 09:58.559
I can't believe you're letting them do this to us.
You've waited all your life to command this ship!

09:58.560 --> 10:00.332
- Dismissed.
- But, sir...

10:00.333 --> 10:06.848
I said you're dismissed. 
Both of you.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.642
You think they've replaced you in Brazil yet?

10:25.643 --> 10:28.446
Even if they have, 
they'd take me back.

10:28.447 --> 10:31.606
I'm a prodigy, remember?

10:31.607 --> 10:33.918
How about you?

10:33.919 --> 10:38.582
After a year on Enterprise the thought of a cargo ship is pretty unappealing.

10:38.583 --> 10:40.605
What if they made you Captain?

10:40.606 --> 10:44.569
You're going to be the most famous Boomer around, you know?

10:44.570 --> 10:47.959
Or maybe infamous.

10:47.960 --> 10:52.696
From what Commander Tucker tells me people back home think that we're doing nothing out here but getting in trouble.

10:52.697 --> 10:55.758
Then it's our job to let the people back home know what really happened.

10:55.759 --> 10:59.335
Anyone who tries to bad-mouth Captain Archer in front of me is going to get an earful

10:59.336 --> 11:02.343
in any language they want.

11:08.391 --> 11:10.208
Come in.

11:13.170 --> 11:17.031
What was so important it couldn't wait till morning?

11:17.032 --> 11:20.959
If you'd prefer, I'll come back.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.370
No, I'm sorry.

11:24.371 --> 11:27.779
What have you got?

11:27.780 --> 11:34.840
Lieutenant Reed and his team have discovered
an unidentified EM signature on the ventral hull of Shuttlepod One.

11:36.647 --> 11:39.049
This could be anything.

11:39.050 --> 11:43.301
- Mr. Reed felt you'd be interested.
- In what?

11:43.302 --> 11:48.046
Does he think that Starfleet Command's going to take a look at this, apologize and send us on our way?

11:48.047 --> 11:51.568
Tell him it was a nice try.

11:53.159 --> 11:57.371
Is this what humans refer to as "feeling sorry for themselves"?

11:57.372 --> 12:00.539
You're out of line, Sub-Commander.

12:02.007 --> 12:05.343
I apologize.

12:05.344 --> 12:08.478
I wish I was simply feeling sorry for myself.

12:08.479 --> 12:14.389
But, actually, I'm feeling sorry for a whole lot of people...
every member of Starfleet, in fact.

12:14.390 --> 12:21.310
Their futures depended upon my ability 
to succeed at this mission.

12:21.311 --> 12:26.217
As soon as we learned about the consequences of the explosion

12:26.218 --> 12:30.246
I knew the Vulcan high command would take advantage of the situation.

12:30.247 --> 12:31.820
What's your point?

12:31.821 --> 12:35.684
You have a responsibility to dispute their recommendation.

12:35.685 --> 12:38.887
Starfleet already bought their recommendation hook, line and sinker.

12:38.888 --> 12:42.002
Then you have a responsibility to convince them as well.

12:42.003 --> 12:44.529
And how do you suggest I do that?

12:44.530 --> 12:47.919
You are very adept  listing the questionable decisions you've made.

12:47.920 --> 12:52.879
but there have been other decisions... many of them that no one would question.

12:52.880 --> 12:58.679
I'm willing to try to convince my government of that.
Are you willing to try to convince yours?

12:59.888 --> 13:09.823
You know... this has got to be the first time 
a Vulcan... has ever attempted to cheer up a human.

13:09.824 --> 13:12.986
I'll see you in the morning.

13:17.127 --> 13:19.174
That's all right, Commander.

13:19.175 --> 13:24.219
Your company is appreciated, but it would be best
if you left the packing to me.

13:24.220 --> 13:29.264
I would have thought 
you'd be a little more upset about leaving Enterprise.

13:29.265 --> 13:32.880
Well, I, uh, I did expect this posting would last a while longer,

13:32.881 --> 13:36.705
but I'm sure an equally adventurous opportunity will present itself.

13:36.706 --> 13:40.528
- I wish I had your attitude.
- Humans seem to be naturally optimistic.

13:40.529 --> 13:45.575
I'm surprised you don't share my outlook 
that something exciting's always waiting around the next nebula.

13:45.576 --> 13:50.392
That's just the point.
There won't be any nebulas in Starfleet's future.

13:50.393 --> 13:55.209
- At least not for a decade so.
- Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.224
You're wrong, Doc. 
You worked with Vulcans.

13:58.225 --> 14:00.445
You know what they think of us.

14:00.446 --> 14:04.329
Enterprise coming back to Earth with it's tail tucked between its legs...

14:04.330 --> 14:06.889
it'll be Soval's crowning achievement.

14:06.890 --> 14:09.586
They'll probably give the son of a bitch some gaudy medal

14:09.587 --> 14:13.607
and then cart him off to wherever they send bitter old Vulcans to retire.

14:13.608 --> 14:17.887
Ambassador Soval's service record contains an impressive list of accomplishments.

14:17.888 --> 14:20.839
You have to find something good in everybody, don't you?!

14:20.840 --> 14:27.652
I got to tell you, that's one of your unique qualities that drives me crazy.

14:27.653 --> 14:31.759
I'll certainly miss  your outspoken personality, Mr. Tucker.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.040
I'll see you later, Doc.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.880
Come on, Porthos. Time for bed.

14:48.479 --> 14:52.265
Porthos, up.

14:52.266 --> 14:58.919
What's the matter, boy?
Don't tell me you're....

15:13.186 --> 15:16.270
Porthos?

15:20.826 --> 15:24.348
What's going on here?

15:35.603 --> 15:35.998
Hello?

15:35.999 --> 15:40.732
Sorry to call you so late, Captain
but all three inspection pods are getting their weekly overhauls tonight.

15:40.733 --> 15:44.286
They tell me they won't be ready till noon.
So I figured you might want to sleep in.

15:44.287 --> 15:47.486
Might want to sleep in.

15:47.487 --> 15:51.813
What do you say to breakfast at 9:30, Spacedock cafeteria?

15:51.814 --> 15:57.264
You must be reading my mind.
I was just about to suggest the same thing.

15:57.265 --> 16:00.686
See you in the morning.

16:08.664 --> 16:17.469
If you're trying to tell me the last ten months was a dream
I'm not buying it.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.169
I.M.E. Can I help you?

16:30.170 --> 16:35.101
This is Captain Jonathan Archer, Starfleet authorization Alpha-Six-Four...

16:35.102 --> 16:38.709
I know who you are, Captain.
What can I do for you?

16:38.710 --> 16:44.294
Do you have a Denobulan doctor in the Interspecies Medical Exchange?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.289
Yes, a Doctor Phlox.

16:46.290 --> 16:49.399
He's assigned to Starfleet Medical here in San Francisco.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.664
Would you like me to contact him for you?

16:53.665 --> 16:58.542
- No, that's all right.
- Thanks for your help.

16:59.930 --> 17:07.272
I didn't even know Phlox existed... 
before they brought Klang in.

17:07.273 --> 17:14.617
And that was the day... after the... late-night call from Trip.

17:14.617 --> 17:22.165
- You're n dreaming, Captain.
- Daniels.

17:22.166 --> 17:26.883
This must be very disorienting.
I apologize, but I had no choice.

17:26.884 --> 17:31.600
Commander Tucker told me you were dead... 
that Silik killed you.

17:31.601 --> 17:34.739
He did... in a manner of speaking.

17:34.740 --> 17:38.505
We have to talk, Captain, and it's essential that 
none of the other factions know about it.

17:38.506 --> 17:40.893
I doubt any of them would think I'd bring you here.

17:40.894 --> 17:50.105
So, you're... telling me you... brought me back, what, ten months ago?

17:50.106 --> 17:52.299
How about Jonathan Archer ten months ago?

17:52.300 --> 17:57.493
- Where's he?
- He's you.

17:57.938 --> 18:01.519
Then who just climbed into bed aboard Enterprise?

18:01.520 --> 18:06.492
That hasn't happened yet.
That's a load of crap and you know it.

18:06.493 --> 18:09.879
I've had this same conversation with half a dozen people.
It always ends up the same way.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.279
Can't you ever give a straight answer?

18:13.280 --> 18:17.127
It depends on the question.

18:17.128 --> 18:23.626
All right, try this one.
Why am I here?

18:23.627 --> 18:27.745
I thought you were supposed to protect the timeline, not screw with it.

18:27.746 --> 18:30.168
It's already been... "screwed with," Captain.

18:30.169 --> 18:33.049
That explosion at the Paraagan colony it wasn't supposed to happen.

18:33.050 --> 18:34.629
Of course, it wasn't. 
It was an accident.

18:34.630 --> 18:39.246
That's not what I mean.
History never recorded the disaster.

18:39.247 --> 18:46.253
Someone violated the Temporal Accord... 
someone who doesn't want your mission to succeed.

18:46.254 --> 18:49.815
Are you telling me that Enterprise didn't cause that explosion?

18:49.816 --> 18:51.867
Do you remember the Temporal Cold War I spoke of?

18:51.868 --> 18:54.656
- It's kind of hard to forget.
- All right, listen to me carefully.

18:54.657 --> 18:57.215
We don't have much time.

19:04.069 --> 19:11.537
All senior staff report to the situation room in 15 minutes.
Mr. Reed, I'd like you in my quarters immediately.

19:18.818 --> 19:24.502
It was just where we detected the EM signature.
But I don't understand... it was completely invisible.

19:24.503 --> 19:30.741
How on Earth did you know that a phase-discriminator would expose it?

19:32.400 --> 19:37.903
If I'm not mistaken you'll find this thing was designed to generate a plasma stream.

19:37.904 --> 19:40.526
Put a team together, Trip.
I'll need two quantum beacons.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.780
They'll have to be positron-based and have an output of 200 gigawatts apiece.

19:43.781 --> 19:47.971
- Positron-based, sir?
- Just get started. I'll bring you the specs in a few minutes.

19:47.972 --> 19:51.276
We're going to need our Com frequencies
on the fritz for a day or so. See to it.

19:51.277 --> 19:55.358
- Aye, sir.
- Put the Armory on full alert.

19:55.359 --> 20:00.935
Turn the ship around, Travis.
We're going back to the Paraagan colony.

20:03.872 --> 20:07.530
What are you all waiting for?

20:07.531 --> 20:09.691
Sir?

20:09.692 --> 20:14.960
It wasn't us, Trip.
We didn't do it.

20:14.961 --> 20:17.799
Whew.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.293
Take a look at the dispersal curve here... and here.

20:23.294 --> 20:27.064
You'll have to isolate the sub-assembly tolerances from the emitter algorithms.

20:27.065 --> 20:29.748
Whoa, hold on a minute.

20:29.749 --> 20:32.920
You're saying the assembly's independent of the emitters?

20:32.921 --> 20:35.759
- Exactly.
- That's impossible.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.985
Not if you generate a stable flux between the positron conductors.

20:39.986 --> 20:44.211
Then all you'll have to do is renormalize the tertiary wave functions.

20:44.212 --> 20:47.679
With all due respect, sir, this is a level of quantum engineering

20:47.680 --> 20:50.826
that's beyond anything I ever learned.

20:50.827 --> 20:52.219
How the hell do you know this?

20:52.220 --> 20:55.680
- Remember Crewman Daniels?
- Yeah.

20:55.681 --> 20:58.087
I saw him get vaporized by our friend, Silik.

20:58.088 --> 21:02.933
Well, for a cloud of vapor he's one wealth of information.

21:02.934 --> 21:07.779
- I just spent two hours with him.
- He's on Enterprise?

21:07.780 --> 21:11.805
Not exactly. 
Listen, I'll explain later.

21:11.806 --> 21:15.691
Right now we've got to get back to building these beacons.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.355
Whatever you say.

21:17.356 --> 21:20.813
The circuitry in there isn't compatible with our technology.

21:20.814 --> 21:24.071
- We'll have to create an interface.
- What for?

21:24.072 --> 21:26.995
We're going to be retrieving some Suliban data discs.

21:26.996 --> 21:29.918
I have no doubt you'll be able to handle the content

21:29.919 --> 21:34.035
but before you can do that 
we'll have to find a way to access the data.

21:34.036 --> 21:38.959
- And Daniels claims this is Suliban technology?
- Everything he's told me has checked out so far.

21:38.960 --> 21:43.608
- I have no reason to doubt himn this.
- We'll do our best, Captain.

21:43.609 --> 21:45.638
Captain.

21:45.639 --> 21:50.588
The Vulcan ship we were headed for... 
it's no doubt detected we've altered course.

21:50.589 --> 21:54.144
- Have they tried to hail us?
- I woul know, sir.

21:54.145 --> 21:56.931
Our com is on the fritz.

22:00.696 --> 22:03.254
Why did Daniels leave it in his quarters?

22:03.255 --> 22:06.025
I don't recall him having much time 
to pack before he left.

22:06.026 --> 22:06.958
No.

22:06.959 --> 22:12.336
Well, if it is there and it contains what he said it does
it could be invaluable to Starfleet.

22:12.337 --> 22:14.143
I gave Daniels my word, Malcolm.

22:14.144 --> 22:18.352
We download the schematics for the Suliban Stealth Cruiser... nothing else.

22:18.353 --> 22:19.347
Pity.

22:19.348 --> 22:24.248
Assuming he's right and we manage to find the Cruiser
what makes you think the Suliban won't come after us?

22:24.249 --> 22:29.160
Just like those old Bible movies, Malcolm: "It wasn't written."

22:51.521 --> 22:55.960
So far, Daniels is batting a thousand.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.462
Wait a minute. You see that?

23:09.463 --> 23:12.248
They've got schematics on half a dozen different Klingon ships.

23:12.249 --> 23:15.749
The Stealth Cruiser, Lieutenant. 
Nothing else.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.429
There.

23:21.430 --> 23:23.549
There it is.

23:32.359 --> 23:34.606
Trip?

23:34.607 --> 23:37.979
I feel like a chef who's just made a meal 
with ingredients he's never tasted.

23:37.980 --> 23:40.039
- You follow the instructions?
- To the letter.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.485
Bridge to Captain Archer.

23:42.486 --> 23:45.511
- Go ahead.
- We're approaching the colony.

23:45.512 --> 23:50.386
Have Mr. Mayweather locate a binary system 
2.5 light years away and set a course.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.984
Understood.

23:51.985 --> 23:54.816
Let's get these mounted on the grappler arms.

23:58.359 --> 24:03.241
Head for the smaller star... then the inner-moon of the second planet.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.261
- Bridge to Armory.
- Reed here.

24:05.262 --> 24:08.728
- Have you plotted all the target points?
- Aye, sir.

24:08.729 --> 24:10.904
Stand by.

24:16.458 --> 24:21.319
I'll meet you two in the launch bay.
If this goes well, I shouldn't be long.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.857
Lower the beacons.

24:32.087 --> 24:36.160
Modify the Viewscreen.
Bring up these coordinates.

24:36.161 --> 24:41.799
Full magnification.
Activate the beacons.

24:47.859 --> 24:51.448
- Right where they're supposed to be.
- Aren't we in range of their sensors, sir?

24:51.449 --> 24:57.410
They can see us. But they have no idea 
we can see through their cloak.

24:57.411 --> 25:01.308
Just keep on the same course, Travis.

25:03.400 --> 25:08.324
- Malcolm.
- The closer, the better, sir.

25:13.890 --> 25:17.239
- They're charging weapons.
- Now, Mr. Reed.

25:24.179 --> 25:29.224
- Their cloaking generator's down.
- l four weapon banks, as well.

25:29.225 --> 25:34.270
- Port and starboard engines disabled.
- Okay, here's the tricky part.

25:39.053 --> 25:42.061
- Reed to Shuttlepod Two.
- Archer here.

25:42.062 --> 25:45.070
She's all yours, Captain. 
Good luck.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.576
That last shot should have sealed off the two lower decks.

25:49.577 --> 25:54.136
If Daniels is right, there shouldn't be more than 20 Suliban for us to deal with.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.226
Is that all?

26:28.761 --> 26:32.142
The stun grenade's on a three-second delay.

27:16.219 --> 27:20.021
Just ten more meters.

27:25.824 --> 27:27.721
Go.

27:44.059 --> 27:47.680
Which one?

27:47.681 --> 27:49.862
Here.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.600
Go.

28:20.209 --> 28:24.013
Captain. They're all around us.

28:24.579 --> 28:26.558
- Archer to Reed
- Go ahead.

28:26.559 --> 28:29.940
- We need some help here.
- I see them.

28:29.941 --> 28:33.400
You'd better take cover.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.452
Go.

29:13.481 --> 29:17.683
- What's the problem?
- I can't release the docking clamps.

29:18.950 --> 29:21.979
Ignite the thrusters.

29:26.008 --> 29:28.691
Go to full power!

29:38.976 --> 29:41.638
- Archer to Mayweather.
- We see you, Captain.

29:41.639 --> 29:45.201
Set a course back ward the Vulcan ship.
Go to warp four as soon as we're aboard.

29:45.202 --> 29:47.387
Yes, sir.

29:59.545 --> 30:03.308
It took a while before we realized
that the three discs had to work in unison.

30:03.309 --> 30:07.279
- The interface seems to be holding.
- Hoshi?

30:07.280 --> 30:11.452
The Stealth Cruiser was definitely in orbit of the Paraagan colony when the explosion took place.

30:11.453 --> 30:13.855
And they were monitoring us very closely.

30:13.856 --> 30:19.887
There are sensors logs that tracked our course, our altitude
even our hull temperature. Look at these.

30:21.647 --> 30:27.377
- I can't believe how close they got.
- They got a lot closer than you think.

30:34.919 --> 30:39.530
Those cloaking devices sure come in handy.

30:45.648 --> 30:48.660
They were docked with the shuttlepod for nearly two minutes.

30:48.661 --> 30:57.529
Just long enough to attach this and cloak it.
Good work. Keep at it.

30:57.530 --> 30:59.980
Get me Admiral Forrest.

30:59.981 --> 31:03.253
Sounds like pretty solid evidence.
Where the hell did you get it?

31:03.254 --> 31:06.525
It's all on three data disks we took from a cloaked Suliban Cruiser.

31:06.526 --> 31:11.422
But how did you know about that cruiser?
And if it was cloaked, how could you find it?

31:11.423 --> 31:16.318
- I've got friends in high places.
- This is going to be a very interesting debriefing.

31:16.319 --> 31:20.423
Get to the Vulcan ship as quickly as you can.
I'll let them know what you've got.

31:20.424 --> 31:26.368
I can't tell you how pleased I am, Jonathan.
After all you've done I would have hated to see this end.

31:26.369 --> 31:31.559
Thank you for believing in us, Admiral.
Archer out.

31:41.264 --> 31:45.463
They boarded a cloaked vessel and they knew exactly where to find the discs.

31:45.464 --> 31:48.777
- They weren't acting alone.
- My ships are fast.

31:48.778 --> 31:53.981
- We can overtake them and destroy Enterprise.
- Have your ships bring me Archer.

31:53.982 --> 31:58.486
- Allow Enterprise to continue.
- But we need to recover the discs.

31:58.487 --> 32:05.508
Archer! You know what happened the last time you failed me.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.436
It was ten months ago. 
He brought me back ten months.

32:11.437 --> 32:15.111
But I knew everything I know now.
How is that possible?

32:15.112 --> 32:19.902
As I've told you the Vulcan Science Directorate has concluded that time travel is impossible.

32:19.903 --> 32:22.246
Well, good for the Vulcan Science Directorate.

32:22.247 --> 32:26.615
Maybe they can tell me how I woke up yesterday knowing exactly where that Suliban ship was.

32:26.616 --> 32:30.880
Or how I suddenly had the ability to construct a quantum beacon to see through its cloak.

32:30.881 --> 32:35.145
And while they're at it, they might as well tell me 
how I knew where to find those disks.

32:35.146 --> 32:36.973
All valid questions.

32:36.974 --> 32:41.265
But to conclude that the only answer is that you acquired this information from a dead crewman

32:41.266 --> 32:44.845
who transported you back through time is illogical.

32:44.846 --> 32:48.368
- Why don't you give me another explanation?
- I can't.

32:48.369 --> 32:51.967
Because there isn't one. 
I got a call from Trip.

32:51.968 --> 32:53.527
Something about inspection pods.

32:53.528 --> 32:57.734
It was the exact same call I got the day before they found Klaang. Word for word.

32:57.735 --> 33:02.886
Perhaps you were dreaming.

33:02.887 --> 33:09.256
Listen... I never thought this was possible, either.

33:09.257 --> 33:17.946
But... I traveled through time and I need you to believe me.

33:17.947 --> 33:20.225
Why?

33:20.226 --> 33:24.621
Because it's hard enough trying to fathom all this 
without having my Science Officer...

33:24.622 --> 33:30.448
a colleague who I trust and rely on 
the person who got me to stop feeling sorry for myself...

33:30.449 --> 33:33.729
accusing me of being an hallucinating madman.

33:33.730 --> 33:37.009
I don't remember accusing you of anything.

33:37.010 --> 33:42.751
- Bridge to Archer.
- Yes?

33:42.752 --> 33:44.707
We're getting some strange readings, sir.

33:44.708 --> 33:48.098
It might not be a bad idea for you to come out here.

33:51.771 --> 33:54.246
I've taken the liberty of asking Commander Tucker to join us.

33:54.247 --> 33:58.500
- What's the problem?
- We're having trouble balancing the warp field.

34:04.748 --> 34:06.507
- Looks okay to me.
- It's odd.

34:06.508 --> 34:12.629
It'll be stable one moment, and then, for no reason
it'll go slightly out of alignment.

34:14.168 --> 34:16.197
What are you guys doing to my engines?

34:16.199 --> 34:18.690
The auto-stabilizers aren't functioning properly.

34:18.690 --> 34:23.286
The computer ran its last diagnostic on them 
less than ten minutes ago.

34:25.659 --> 34:27.878
- They look fine.
- Well, they're not.

34:27.879 --> 34:32.061
We've had to realign the field a dozen times over the last hour.

34:38.407 --> 34:44.428
Load torpedoes.
And stand by all weapons.

34:44.429 --> 34:47.989
Deploy the beacons, Travis.

34:47.989 --> 34:53.429
Modify the Viewscreen and aim the beacons aft.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.779
Swing them down slowly.

35:08.222 --> 35:11.498
It looks like we're in a swarm of cloaked bees.

35:11.499 --> 35:14.507
Charge the phase-cannons.

35:15.096 --> 35:17.580
We're being hailed.

35:24.733 --> 35:27.901
Put it through.

35:27.902 --> 35:34.904
I wouldn't advise using your weapons, Jonathan.
Perhaps if we decloak, you'll understand why.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.259
Malcolm?

35:45.260 --> 35:48.517
They're all armed with high-yield particle weapons, sir.

35:48.518 --> 35:51.774
- How many could you take out?
- Before they open fire?

35:51.775 --> 35:55.108
Not enough, sir.

35:59.749 --> 36:02.768
One of my ships is approaching your starboard docking port.

36:02.769 --> 36:06.199
I'd like you to board it immediately.

36:08.382 --> 36:11.967
- What do you want with me?
- You have five minutes.

36:11.968 --> 36:15.526
If you don't comply I have permission to destroy Enterprise.

36:15.527 --> 36:18.687
How do I know you won't destroy Enterprise either way?

36:18.688 --> 36:26.866
You have my word, Captain.
And you also have 4 and half minutes left.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.606
I'm placing you in command.

36:49.607 --> 36:54.157
I advise you to maintain your present course and speed.

36:54.158 --> 37:01.366
I don't know what's going to happen... 
but try to keep an open mind.

37:01.367 --> 37:09.099
Especially when it comes to things the Vulcan Science Directorate says are... impossible.

37:09.100 --> 37:14.571
- I'll try.
- Captain, this is crazy.

37:14.572 --> 37:18.608
- How do you know what they're going to do?
- T'Pol's in command now, Trip.

37:18.609 --> 37:26.910
Do whatever you can to help her.
That goes for all of you.

37:30.791 --> 37:35.239
Keep an eye on Porthos for me, would you?

37:37.639 --> 37:42.662
Remember: No cheese.

38:13.903 --> 38:17.454
Your Captain's playing a very dangerous game, Sub-Commander.

38:17.455 --> 38:20.023
- Game?
- He has 30 seconds left.

38:20.024 --> 38:24.178
Did he think Iasn't serious?

38:27.288 --> 38:30.166
The Turbolift's on E-Deck. It's empty.

38:30.167 --> 38:34.119
- Where is he? 
- I'm not reading his bio-signs.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.865
He must be on the Suliban ship.

38:42.866 --> 38:46.167
Captain Archer is no longer aboard Enterprise.

38:46.168 --> 38:49.106
Perhaps you should check with the vessel you sent for him.

38:49.107 --> 38:53.784
I thought he was smarter than this.
He could have saved all your lives.

38:53.785 --> 38:56.947
What a waste.

38:56.948 --> 39:00.338
The docked ship is moving away.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.727
It's targeting our warp core.

39:03.728 --> 39:08.121
They're all targetting the warp core.

39:37.199 --> 39:43.458
Ten minutes ago, that vista was more beautiful
than anything you could imagine.

39:44.420 --> 39:47.206
Where am I?

39:47.207 --> 39:53.190
I-I had breakfast in that room less than... half an hour ago.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.736
Then I was instructed to bring you here.

39:55.737 --> 40:00.651
They told me that the timeline wouldn't be safe 
if you boarded that Suliban ship.

40:00.652 --> 40:04.716
- Someone was very mistaken.
- Where is here?

40:04.717 --> 40:10.142
You're in the 31st century, Captain, 
or what's left of it.

40:11.384 --> 40:15.695
You said the Suliban wouldn't follow us
that we'd make it safely to the Vulcan ship.

40:15.696 --> 40:18.446
As far as I was told that was exactly
what was supposed to occur.

40:18.447 --> 40:21.854
So you're telling me this just happened?

40:21.855 --> 40:25.261
It doesn't look like it just happened.

40:25.262 --> 40:27.228
No.

40:27.229 --> 40:30.528
It looks like it happened a long time ago

40:30.529 --> 40:35.240
If bringing me here caused this, then send me back.

40:35.241 --> 40:38.125
I'll take my chances with Silik.

40:38.126 --> 40:40.190
Y-You don't understand.

40:40.191 --> 40:46.430
All our equipment... the time-portals... have been destroyed.

40:46.431 --> 40:52.670
Everything's been destroyed.
There's no way to send you back.

41:15.129 --> 41:19.136
