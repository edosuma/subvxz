02:02.287 --> 02:05.341
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:05.421 --> 02:07.847
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

02:09.794 --> 02:11.677
Breathe, come on.

02:29.148 --> 02:31.035
It's getting worse.

02:31.615 --> 02:34.005
She has an active imagination.

02:34.085 --> 02:35.973
She's really scared.

02:36.053 --> 02:40.413
I know. But there's no signs of anybody
coming in so I don't know what we can do.

02:41.493 --> 02:43.081
She wants to move back.

02:43.670 --> 02:46.759
That's it, isn't it? This is part of that?

02:48.290 --> 02:51.157
- I don't think she's making this up.
- It's not an option.

02:51.237 --> 02:54.787
This is the only place we can afford,
and it's close to my job.

02:55.274 --> 03:00.093
- Uh, we could move back.
- We can't. They're still looking for us.

03:02.047 --> 03:03.919
You shouldn't have borrowed from them.

03:03.999 --> 03:05.814
It was the only option.

03:07.552 --> 03:09.791
- You should've...
- What? Just let you die?

03:09.871 --> 03:12.377
There was no miracle match
coming to that hospital.

03:12.457 --> 03:14.853
- It could have happened!
- It was the only way.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.282
We could've found another way.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.251
I found a way, and you're alive.

03:20.431 --> 03:23.689
This is a small town.
They're not going to look for us here.

03:24.669 --> 03:26.924
Hopefully, maybe, you can find a job.

03:27.104 --> 03:30.128
Pay them back. I don't know how...

03:30.608 --> 03:32.457
...but we will.

04:06.444 --> 04:07.922
Hello?

04:15.454 --> 04:16.970
Hello?

04:25.830 --> 04:27.652
Come out.

04:28.132 --> 04:29.981
I don't want any trouble.

04:43.414 --> 04:45.498
I don't want any trouble.

04:46.584 --> 04:48.166
Just...

04:48.821 --> 04:50.699
...so just come out!

05:59.591 --> 06:02.640
Maybe you can help your father
unpack in the basement.

06:07.199 --> 06:09.015
Do I have to?

06:16.108 --> 06:17.590
No.

06:18.943 --> 06:22.588
But it would be nice to get everything
in order so we can enjoy the house.

06:29.854 --> 06:31.637
Will that do it?

06:52.910 --> 06:55.968
Hey, don't worry about it.

06:56.448 --> 06:59.465
You can help out another night.
It's all mine tonight.

07:09.694 --> 07:11.874
Once school starts,
you'll like it better here.

07:13.731 --> 07:15.786
I don't like it here.

07:16.366 --> 07:20.054
Give it time. You'll make
new friends once school starts.

07:20.134 --> 07:23.590
We have to make it work.
Hopefully your father gets a job.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.698
Megan, did you just say something?

08:00.845 --> 08:03.897
Rob! Rob! Rob!

08:26.070 --> 08:27.953
There was somebody there.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.264
I checked everywhere.
All the doors are locked.

08:32.344 --> 08:34.275
Maybe it was a mouse.

08:34.355 --> 08:37.001
It wasn't a mouse. Too big, and that sound.

08:37.782 --> 08:40.466
Well, it's an old house, so...

08:43.488 --> 08:46.261
- Megan didn't say anything?
- No, she didn't notice anything.

08:46.341 --> 08:49.981
So... so out of it for that minute.

08:50.461 --> 08:52.278
She seems out of it a lot.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.149
Maybe just the stress of a new school.

09:00.772 --> 09:02.321
Probably.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.355
Bitch is mine!

10:48.961 --> 10:50.770
What are you doing?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.871
Other...

10:52.951 --> 10:54.572
...There was a...

11:15.807 --> 11:16.994
Bitch is mine!

11:17.074 --> 11:20.866
- We are both tired and stressed.
- I didn't imagine it.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.578
So some creature running around,
perched on the walls. Is that is?

11:23.658 --> 11:27.005
- You saw something too.
- I thought I did, but no faces.

11:27.085 --> 11:29.140
It's just stress, probably.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.375
Something doesn't feel right here.

11:31.455 --> 11:35.046
So you want to go back too?
Well, I guess Megan is getting to you.

11:35.126 --> 11:38.562
- I didn't say that. But it's not...
- I have to go to work.

11:38.642 --> 11:40.511
We can talk later.

12:05.090 --> 12:09.374
- What's happening to me?
- Nothing. You just need to rest.

12:11.363 --> 12:14.033
I feel so tired all the time.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.121
It'll pass.

12:17.751 --> 12:19.567
I'm scared.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.288
There's nothing to be scared about.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.057
She's coming for me.

12:27.579 --> 12:29.467
What are you talking about?

12:29.847 --> 12:32.848
I can't see her clearly, but she's coming.

12:33.418 --> 12:37.033
Nobody's coming for you.
I won't let anything happen to you.

12:38.223 --> 12:40.778
I feel her every night.

12:40.858 --> 12:42.541
Look.

12:42.961 --> 12:46.752
If anybody's coming in here,
we'll catch them. So don't worry.

12:46.832 --> 12:48.714
I'm on watch all night.

12:52.403 --> 12:54.252
Good night, Megan.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.392
Good night.

16:16.373 --> 16:19.857
Megan, I'm going to go wake up
your mom. Can you get the coffee going?

16:34.459 --> 16:37.314
Oh, hey, honey, it's just me.
Don't be scared.

16:41.699 --> 16:43.687
Wait. You?

16:43.767 --> 16:45.316
What?

16:48.572 --> 16:51.457
- Weren't you just downstairs?
- No.

16:59.016 --> 17:01.806
We must have had a blackout.
All the clocks reset.

17:01.886 --> 17:05.142
- It was fine last night.
- I thought it thundered.

17:05.722 --> 17:08.406
- You see that?
- What?

17:15.967 --> 17:17.481
There.

17:18.236 --> 17:20.085
Play it again.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.168
I turned.

17:30.548 --> 17:32.469
Something moved.

17:32.549 --> 17:34.432
It was my shadow.

17:37.022 --> 17:38.610
Maybe.

18:00.444 --> 18:01.966
Hey.

18:02.046 --> 18:05.236
- Got something for you.
- It's not my birthday yet.

18:05.316 --> 18:08.355
I know. But I saw this at the antique store.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.318
It's an advance gift.

18:19.730 --> 18:22.619
- It's beautiful.
- What's beautiful?

18:22.699 --> 18:24.248
This.

18:25.236 --> 18:27.091
Where did you get that?

18:27.571 --> 18:30.595
Got it at an antique store.

18:31.175 --> 18:32.931
It's beautiful, right?

18:33.411 --> 18:35.194
Open it.

18:39.283 --> 18:42.700
- Love that picture.
- Thanks, Dad.

18:44.388 --> 18:48.012
Oh! Oh, you're strong.
Going to mess up my new kidney.

18:48.092 --> 18:50.080
- Sorry.
- Just kidding.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.816
I know things have been rough,
but everything's going to be okay.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.779
All right?

18:56.201 --> 18:57.703
Right.

18:57.783 --> 18:59.484
Hope so.

18:59.569 --> 19:01.418
Time for school.

19:09.013 --> 19:11.402
What store did you say you got that at again?

19:11.482 --> 19:13.298
At the...

19:15.118 --> 19:16.975
What does it matter?

19:17.555 --> 19:19.772
It doesn't. Just curious.

19:27.998 --> 19:29.610
Hi.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.191
Hi.

19:32.737 --> 19:36.361
Uh, sorry to bother you. I'm Skip.
This is my partner, Helena.

19:36.441 --> 19:39.963
- Do we know each other?
- No. We were just...

19:40.043 --> 19:41.933
How can I help you?

19:43.013 --> 19:46.418
Well, it's, um,
how we can help you, actually.

19:46.498 --> 19:49.940
- Your daughter's in danger.
- What do you know about my daughter?

19:50.020 --> 19:53.410
Your daughter is in danger,
and I can tell by your face you know.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.602
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:55.682 --> 19:58.342
Your daughter is being targeted,
and we're here to help you.

19:58.422 --> 20:01.493
- Please, Robert, hear us out.
- How do you know my name?

20:01.573 --> 20:04.042
Listen, we followed the signs to you.
The ones before you.

20:04.222 --> 20:06.851
The birth records. The whole profile.

20:14.544 --> 20:16.952
It's not from the world of the living.

20:20.351 --> 20:23.607
Her birthday is in three days.
That's all the time you have.

20:23.687 --> 20:26.377
You're crazy. Both of you.
Now get out of here.

20:26.457 --> 20:28.947
You don't have much time left. Please.

20:29.027 --> 20:33.718
- All right, get out of here, now!
- Okay, okay, okay. We're sorry.

20:34.398 --> 20:38.957
We're go... we're going, we're going.
Just, um, take my card.

20:39.637 --> 20:41.519
- Please.
- Go!

20:42.073 --> 20:43.922
Call me.

21:52.476 --> 21:54.165
Are you really going to stay down here again?

21:54.245 --> 21:56.134
I need to.

21:58.214 --> 22:00.169
What are you doing?

22:00.249 --> 22:02.473
Backup, in case the power goes out again.

22:02.553 --> 22:05.944
It won't. It's supposed to be clear tonight.

22:07.142 --> 22:08.990
I hope it is!

23:08.319 --> 23:11.141
Susan! Susan!

23:11.721 --> 23:13.240
Susan!

23:16.761 --> 23:19.780
Susan! Susan!

24:05.710 --> 24:07.242
Susan.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.861
Hey, Susan.

24:20.892 --> 24:24.816
- You should go to the doctor.
- It's okay. It's just surface cuts.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.818
It might get infected.

24:26.898 --> 24:28.519
They won't.

24:29.199 --> 24:32.056
Well, we have to report this.
Whoever did this is still out there.

24:32.136 --> 24:35.728
What are we going to report?
Someone carved crosses on my back...

24:35.808 --> 24:38.697
- ...and we didn't see him?
- That's the truth.

24:38.777 --> 24:41.466
We can't afford for people
to think we are crazy.

24:41.546 --> 24:44.569
- No, they won't.
- They will.

24:45.149 --> 24:49.338
People don't hire crazies.
I can't lose this job.

24:49.418 --> 24:52.470
- Then what can we do?
- I don't know!

24:55.192 --> 24:56.774
Cameras.

26:16.005 --> 26:18.061
I had another bad dream.

27:30.179 --> 27:34.563
- Father Mullins, thank you for coming.
- Well, I'll be happy to help if I can.

27:44.293 --> 27:48.746
Have you... have you taken her
to see a doctor again?

27:49.867 --> 27:53.317
Yes. And they still say she's fine.

27:55.445 --> 27:56.995
Well...

27:57.875 --> 28:00.098
...I don't see what it is I can do.

28:00.538 --> 28:02.966
I mean, what I see here is...

28:03.646 --> 28:06.300
...it's disturbing. But...

28:06.380 --> 28:08.441
...but that's all it is.

28:09.151 --> 28:13.144
And I think that maybe you
should seek professional help.

28:13.624 --> 28:16.614
No, Father. She's normal.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.510
All of this is recent.

28:20.864 --> 28:22.487
She's not crazy.

28:22.567 --> 28:25.526
No, dear, I'm not suggesting she's crazy.

28:26.436 --> 28:31.195
I just think that you'd benefit
by a real professional opinion.

28:32.175 --> 28:34.191
If you just could take a look at her.

28:38.683 --> 28:41.771
Well, of course I can, and I will.

28:41.851 --> 28:46.066
But I just don't see
what good it's going to do.

28:46.146 --> 28:48.205
It just would be great if you did.

29:18.222 --> 29:22.212
She's stayed in bed since yesterday.
She's really out of it.

29:22.292 --> 29:23.814
Megan?

29:24.644 --> 29:28.695
Megan, this is Father Mullins.
He's just here to check on you.

29:30.233 --> 29:33.818
Megan, how are you feeling, dear?

29:35.172 --> 29:37.020
I'm tired.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.958
Why are you tired, dear?

29:41.546 --> 29:43.366
No reason.

29:44.848 --> 29:48.484
Well, they also said
that you told them that...

29:48.564 --> 29:51.208
"...she" was coming to get you.

29:53.388 --> 29:55.272
Yes, she is.

29:56.092 --> 29:57.447
Hmm.

29:57.527 --> 30:00.778
And, uh, who is she?

30:02.266 --> 30:04.148
I don't know.

30:06.602 --> 30:08.451
Well, um...

30:09.173 --> 30:11.256
...where does she live?

30:13.443 --> 30:15.286
I don't know.

30:16.046 --> 30:17.862
But you do.

30:20.784 --> 30:22.367
What?

30:24.889 --> 30:28.126
She lives in the same place
you take young boys to.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.883
Maybe you want to try a little girl instead.

30:33.963 --> 30:35.920
- Megan! Megan!
- Oh!

30:36.000 --> 30:38.656
- Megan! Megan!
- Megan! Megan! Megan!

30:38.736 --> 30:40.757
- Oh!
- Megan!

30:47.476 --> 30:49.433
Help me.

30:49.513 --> 30:51.702
Megan. Megan.

31:00.524 --> 31:02.613
Father, please help us!

31:02.693 --> 31:05.281
I have not done anything.

31:05.361 --> 31:09.152
- Maybe some impure thoughts.
- We're not judging you.

31:09.232 --> 31:12.384
- But I took an oath.
- But you haven't done anything, Father...

31:12.464 --> 31:15.055
- ...and that's all that matters.
- I don't know how...

31:15.135 --> 31:17.266
...or what this thing is.

31:17.346 --> 31:20.197
Something is happening to her,
and it's not medical.

31:20.777 --> 31:23.232
So, what, you think this is a possession?

31:24.012 --> 31:25.969
Somebody else said that.

31:26.049 --> 31:27.871
- Who?
- Look, I...

31:27.951 --> 31:32.076
...I'll speak with my superiors and see
if there's anything that we can do, okay?

31:32.156 --> 31:34.311
Thank you, Father.

31:34.391 --> 31:37.442
I am sorry. Very sorry.

31:52.943 --> 31:54.831
It wasn't her.

31:55.111 --> 31:57.166
No, it wasn't.

31:57.546 --> 31:59.369
She's just sick.

31:59.989 --> 32:03.541
I understand that this
must be very hard to process...

32:04.721 --> 32:07.578
...but she is being possessed.

32:09.108 --> 32:10.658
Possessed?

32:12.461 --> 32:14.551
Is that what you want us to believe?

32:15.131 --> 32:16.820
Yes.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.383
What other explanation do you have?

32:22.272 --> 32:24.088
I don't know.

32:25.341 --> 32:28.224
You called us.

32:29.345 --> 32:32.035
Because you're out of options, right?

32:33.415 --> 32:35.232
The priest.

32:38.655 --> 32:40.671
Did you call the police the first time?

32:42.627 --> 32:45.883
All we had then was that the intruder
appeared to be Megan.

32:46.713 --> 32:48.962
We can't afford the attention.

32:50.784 --> 32:52.633
We're new here.

32:57.191 --> 33:00.047
There's a prophecy that on
the 18th birthday of a girl...

33:00.127 --> 33:02.548
...born to parents out of wedlock...

33:02.628 --> 33:06.172
...that girl will serve as a vessel
for the entrance into this world...

33:06.252 --> 33:08.053
...of a demon.

33:09.536 --> 33:11.424
We were young.

33:11.904 --> 33:13.960
But we did the right thing getting married.

33:14.640 --> 33:18.230
I'm not judging you.
I'm sorry, we're not judging you.

33:18.310 --> 33:20.127
This is how we found you.

33:23.017 --> 33:28.014
Additionally, the girl would be living
in a home with a past like the future.

33:28.094 --> 33:29.903
What does that mean?

33:31.991 --> 33:34.408
A girl died in your home a while ago.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.172
What happened to her?

33:39.732 --> 33:41.615
She was killed.

33:44.271 --> 33:46.086
They never found the killer.

33:47.061 --> 33:48.729
Oh, my God.

33:48.809 --> 33:51.531
We're sorry you had to find out
this way, but it's best you know.

33:51.611 --> 33:53.193
Wait.

33:57.949 --> 34:00.940
- Is that her?
- Yes!

34:01.020 --> 34:02.843
The Willow girl.

34:03.623 --> 34:06.197
- Where did you get this?
- Found it in the basement.

34:06.277 --> 34:09.348
- You gave it to Megan!
- I didn't know.

34:09.428 --> 34:11.277
She's in great danger.

34:12.899 --> 34:15.782
You said a house with a past like the future.

34:16.937 --> 34:18.891
Does that mean Megan will be killed?

34:18.971 --> 34:21.876
If she possesses her...

34:21.956 --> 34:23.956
...she will be dead in spirit.

34:24.911 --> 34:28.335
This is crazy. I can't believe you.

34:28.815 --> 34:32.905
She's going to...
she's going to be 18 in two days.

34:33.085 --> 34:36.203
Please, just let us try to help you.

34:39.542 --> 34:43.600
- What can you do?
- Stop the demon before it takes her over.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.034
Who is this demon?

34:47.751 --> 34:49.800
The demon's name...

34:49.880 --> 34:51.757
...her name...

34:51.838 --> 34:53.659
...is Abyzou.

34:54.438 --> 34:58.031
Now, she couldn't conceive a child...

34:58.111 --> 35:01.851
...to carry on her legacy,
so the point when a girl...

35:01.931 --> 35:03.436
...becomes a woman...

35:03.516 --> 35:06.339
...is the point
when she can fulfill her goal...

35:06.419 --> 35:08.669
...to enter this world again.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.341
This is crazy.

35:16.296 --> 35:18.345
There's no other explanation.

36:03.626 --> 36:05.459
It's you.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.161
Open the door or I'm going to call the cops.

36:08.241 --> 36:09.470
Go away!

36:09.550 --> 36:12.000
There's something happening to my daughter.

36:15.588 --> 36:17.460
You made a deal.

36:17.992 --> 36:21.648
I was desperate. I promise
I will pay you back the money.

36:21.728 --> 36:23.807
Just leave her alone.

36:23.887 --> 36:28.020
It isn't with me.
You didn't make a deal with me.

36:28.100 --> 36:32.692
That's bullshit. This "selling
her soul" nonsense. It's bullshit.

36:33.202 --> 36:35.063
I didn't believe that.

36:36.710 --> 36:39.299
You took the money...

36:39.379 --> 36:41.462
...and she made it happen.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.302
Abyzou.

36:50.856 --> 36:52.745
Your daughter.

36:53.225 --> 36:55.108
She was killed.

36:57.095 --> 36:59.147
Was it her? Abyzou?

37:01.668 --> 37:03.957
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:04.037 --> 37:07.661
The locket you tried to give me
for my daughter.

37:08.241 --> 37:11.472
My husband found that in my house.

37:13.714 --> 37:15.268
No.

37:15.648 --> 37:17.464
That's impossible.

37:18.719 --> 37:21.403
Please, you know more. Please help me.

37:24.057 --> 37:26.713
I was asked to make an offer.

37:27.393 --> 37:29.181
That's all.

37:29.261 --> 37:31.385
I can't help you.

37:31.465 --> 37:33.786
I accepted the money.

37:33.866 --> 37:36.390
That's it. The rest is bullshit!

37:36.470 --> 37:38.857
The offer was real.

37:38.937 --> 37:41.387
I'm going to call the cops.

37:44.110 --> 37:47.133
If you call the cops,
what are you going to tell them?

37:47.643 --> 37:51.264
That you made a deal with me
to sell your daughter's soul?

37:55.542 --> 37:57.592
Is Abyzou real?

38:02.178 --> 38:03.728
Yes.

38:04.930 --> 38:06.780
What can I do?

38:09.435 --> 38:11.486
You made a deal.

38:13.139 --> 38:15.222
God help you.

38:16.649 --> 38:18.478
God help you.

38:24.150 --> 38:26.446
Please tell me what I can do.

38:29.523 --> 38:31.338
Help me!

38:37.097 --> 38:38.946
Help me.

39:21.874 --> 39:24.598
Uh, holy water.

39:25.578 --> 39:29.002
You might see some things
tonight you don't want to see.

39:29.082 --> 39:30.931
We already have.

39:32.252 --> 39:35.234
Tonight is Megan's birthday,
and so the demon will most likely...

39:35.314 --> 39:38.945
...take on a more physical form
to try to take her over.

39:39.025 --> 39:41.848
This is our best chance to stop it.

39:42.228 --> 39:45.845
You have to be strong,
and listen only to me and Helena.

40:16.062 --> 40:17.884
I'll take first watch.

40:17.964 --> 40:20.981
You guys get some rest.
I'll wake you up later.

40:43.823 --> 40:45.679
Oh, God.

40:59.072 --> 41:00.921
Oh, no.

41:50.022 --> 41:52.700
Skip. Skip.

44:10.128 --> 44:11.711
Helena?

44:26.880 --> 44:29.129
I condemn you back from where you came.

44:33.119 --> 44:34.701
Helena?

44:36.055 --> 44:37.572
Helena?

45:04.050 --> 45:06.723
I got you. I got you.

45:06.803 --> 45:08.625
You want to play games?

45:09.055 --> 45:10.610
Okay.

45:11.090 --> 45:13.540
Afraid to face me? Huh?

45:14.659 --> 45:16.242
Helena.

45:17.163 --> 45:18.745
Helena.

45:40.035 --> 45:41.584
Skip!

45:49.795 --> 45:51.311
Helena.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.382
Hey.

46:07.113 --> 46:08.695
Helena?

46:11.884 --> 46:14.808
Fight it. Fight it, Helena.

46:14.888 --> 46:17.449
Fight it. Fight!

47:11.243 --> 47:13.266
They want me to go.

47:13.946 --> 47:15.495
Yes.

47:18.484 --> 47:20.567
What if I don't want to go?

47:21.853 --> 47:23.909
A deal was made.

47:24.389 --> 47:26.606
A life for a life.

47:28.494 --> 47:30.350
Whose life?

47:30.430 --> 47:33.914
Your father's for yours.

47:37.971 --> 47:40.459
She loves him more than me.

47:41.839 --> 47:43.355
Yes.

47:43.910 --> 47:45.993
More than you.

47:47.345 --> 47:49.228
More than me?

47:51.084 --> 47:52.899
More than me?

48:37.629 --> 48:39.145
Susan.

49:38.472 --> 49:42.049
- Bitch is mine!
- Megan! Megan!

49:42.494 --> 49:44.248
Where is she?

49:44.328 --> 49:46.251
I don't know.

49:46.331 --> 49:48.215
I don't know.

50:16.182 --> 50:18.947
Oh! What is... what is that?

50:19.027 --> 50:21.603
- It's not her.
- What?

50:22.033 --> 50:23.918
It has her.

50:27.906 --> 50:30.329
- Rush her.
- What?

50:32.077 --> 50:34.453
- Rush her, on three. One...
- Wait.

50:36.547 --> 50:38.163
Two.

50:40.184 --> 50:41.680
Three!

50:46.325 --> 50:48.197
- Get her arms!
- Okay!

50:48.277 --> 50:49.949
- Do you have any rope?
- Yeah, over there.

50:50.029 --> 50:51.917
Get it.

50:56.234 --> 50:57.481
Hurry up, Rob.

51:02.074 --> 51:03.956
Take my place.

51:09.148 --> 51:10.964
I'll be back.

51:37.710 --> 51:40.833
You will kill her if you try.

51:40.913 --> 51:43.134
Someone afraid to go for a little swim?

51:45.184 --> 51:48.908
Humor in the time of death on the horizon?

51:48.988 --> 51:51.976
Your death. You cannot hide
in her in the water.

51:53.125 --> 51:55.681
Hide? I'm not hiding.

51:55.761 --> 51:59.250
I'm ready to be in your world forever.

52:11.376 --> 52:13.731
Don't you want to know where she is?

52:13.811 --> 52:15.828
Don't talk to her.

52:18.950 --> 52:20.799
Where is she?

52:22.019 --> 52:25.037
- Close.
- Don't listen to her.

52:29.362 --> 52:31.611
Don't listen to her.

52:35.199 --> 52:36.782
Susan.

52:39.405 --> 52:40.987
Susan!

52:44.576 --> 52:47.333
She is mine! Me!

52:47.413 --> 52:50.468
Thank you for your permission.

52:56.288 --> 52:57.838
Permission?

52:59.392 --> 53:02.476
- Permission?
- I didn't know!

53:04.663 --> 53:07.314
It was the only way to save you.

53:09.135 --> 53:12.690
I... I didn't... I didn't believe
the other part.

53:12.770 --> 53:15.856
A house of lies.

53:17.977 --> 53:20.426
Do they know your failures?

53:21.913 --> 53:23.802
You will not take her.

53:29.288 --> 53:31.103
Keep her under.

53:41.065 --> 53:42.881
Close the door.

53:46.271 --> 53:48.086
She's drowning.

53:48.974 --> 53:51.658
She's okay. It'll leave her or die.

53:53.091 --> 53:55.846
- Helena will die.
- No, she won't.

54:07.392 --> 54:08.907
No.

54:27.713 --> 54:30.330
Skip! Skip!

55:01.546 --> 55:03.429
You're okay.

55:04.616 --> 55:06.432
You're okay.

55:09.421 --> 55:11.004
Rob?

55:12.358 --> 55:13.873
Rob?

55:16.929 --> 55:20.019
I have to go see what's going on.
I'll be right back.

55:20.099 --> 55:22.555
No! No, no.

55:23.335 --> 55:27.025
Okay. Okay, we can go together. Okay?

55:27.505 --> 55:30.389
Come on, I got you. Come on.

55:42.487 --> 55:44.008
Rob?

55:44.488 --> 55:46.039
Skip?

57:33.965 --> 57:35.814
Up there.

58:00.758 --> 58:02.059
There!

58:37.762 --> 58:39.344
Skip?

58:40.499 --> 58:42.020
Skip?

58:45.636 --> 58:47.188
Skip!

58:49.007 --> 58:52.291
Ah! Oh, thank you.

58:54.812 --> 58:56.702
You got this.

59:06.156 --> 59:08.240
Come on.

59:26.778 --> 59:28.293
Megan?

59:30.649 --> 59:32.198
Megan?

59:38.823 --> 59:40.672
You sold me.

59:45.330 --> 59:47.613
No, I didn't.

59:48.868 --> 59:51.718
I didn't... I didn't think this was real.

59:54.339 --> 59:56.829
You love him more than me.

59:58.709 --> 01:00:00.258
No.

01:00:00.979 --> 01:00:03.028
I love you both.

01:00:12.858 --> 01:00:15.313
Okay, I'm going to get you out of here, okay?

01:00:15.393 --> 01:00:17.129
No one is leaving.

01:00:17.209 --> 01:00:20.085
She cannot kill until she is me.

01:00:21.065 --> 01:00:23.289
And then you all will die.

01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:25.592
No.

01:00:27.472 --> 01:00:29.955
No. No!

01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:32.342
No.

01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:07.359
- There we go. Let's go.
- Help me. Thanks.

01:01:12.813 --> 01:01:14.406
No!

01:01:32.002 --> 01:01:35.326
- Wait. It's a distraction.
- What?

01:01:35.406 --> 01:01:37.555
- We need to go back to the house.
- No, Susan went up there.

01:01:37.635 --> 01:01:40.899
No, it happens in the house.
It happens in the house.

01:01:40.979 --> 01:01:43.257
- It just wants us to run around here.
- Let's go.

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:45.096
No, but Susan...

01:01:45.176 --> 01:01:47.433
We don't have time. Come on, trust me.

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.809
Goddamn.

01:01:52.757 --> 01:01:54.279
Susan!

01:02:40.917 --> 01:02:44.322
I smell your fear.

01:02:45.544 --> 01:02:47.600
I smell your fear.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.169
You cannot have this child.

01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:53.705
Are you her protector?

01:02:53.785 --> 01:02:56.002
Are you her protector?

01:02:58.222 --> 01:02:59.511
Yes.

01:02:59.591 --> 01:03:02.375
And who will protect you?

01:03:12.704 --> 01:03:17.188
- Come face us, demon.
- Am I to be afraid of you?

01:03:19.676 --> 01:03:21.572
You are.

01:03:22.346 --> 01:03:25.804
Why does the sensitive one not speak?

01:03:26.484 --> 01:03:29.541
A vessel to trap, only not a speak of speak.

01:03:29.621 --> 01:03:31.843
I have nothing to say to you.

01:03:33.025 --> 01:03:37.276
Then you will not need your tongue
when I rip it out and feed it to you!

01:03:47.871 --> 01:03:49.422
Helena?

01:03:51.376 --> 01:03:52.897
Skip.

01:03:53.277 --> 01:03:54.799
Skip.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.437
Oh, my God.

01:04:06.924 --> 01:04:08.513
Helena!

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.120
No! Stop it!

01:04:34.819 --> 01:04:37.570
Stop hurting her, please!

01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:51.449
Helena?

01:04:55.824 --> 01:04:58.107
Helena. Helena.

01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:11.136
Get away from her!

01:05:57.502 --> 01:05:58.990
Okay.

01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:02.957
There you go. This should stop
the bleeding for now...

01:06:03.037 --> 01:06:05.840
...till we get something better.

01:06:07.479 --> 01:06:09.328
Something's wrong.

01:06:11.049 --> 01:06:13.299
What? What are you talking about?

01:06:17.022 --> 01:06:18.838
It can't be here.

01:06:20.392 --> 01:06:24.735
There's not much time left.
It would have Megan here by now.

01:06:25.162 --> 01:06:29.083
- But it happened here last time.
- It knows we know that.

01:06:30.433 --> 01:06:32.283
It's a decoy.

01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.005
Susan!

01:07:00.698 --> 01:07:02.212
Susan!

01:07:02.292 --> 01:07:03.848
Susan.

01:07:04.486 --> 01:07:06.029
Susan.

01:07:06.169 --> 01:07:08.193
Megan! Megan!

01:07:08.673 --> 01:07:10.262
Susan!

01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:12.661
No one can hear you.

01:07:17.247 --> 01:07:19.305
You can scream if you like.

01:07:20.585 --> 01:07:22.101
Susan?

01:07:28.525 --> 01:07:30.545
She's here with me.

01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:32.516
Susan, fight it!

01:07:35.934 --> 01:07:38.156
Why fight destiny?

01:07:38.236 --> 01:07:41.526
Susan, wake up! Megan! Megan!

01:07:50.714 --> 01:07:53.105
Long have I waited to walk this earth.

01:07:53.185 --> 01:07:55.407
Susan, fight it!

01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:03.217
What an earth it will be.

01:08:03.297 --> 01:08:05.543
Susan, fight it!

01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:15.321
Hurry.

01:08:22.645 --> 01:08:24.196
Megan.

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:27.701
Hurry!

01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:54.527
Oh, sensitive one...

01:08:56.647 --> 01:09:00.337
...no final blood will be shed until after.

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:03.600
You cannot have her.

01:09:23.374 --> 01:09:26.058
It's going to come out. Be ready.

01:09:38.488 --> 01:09:40.738
Skip! Skip, what's happening?

01:09:45.261 --> 01:09:46.877
I don't know.

01:09:53.904 --> 01:09:56.634
Okay, if it doesn't come out,
then we have to stop it inside her.

01:09:56.714 --> 01:09:59.137
Inside her? What does that mean?

01:10:01.012 --> 01:10:02.800
I'm sorry, Rob.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.331
It's the only way.

01:10:07.819 --> 01:10:10.412
No! No!

01:10:20.363 --> 01:10:23.964
- Don't let her go.
- She's... she's transferring!

01:10:24.768 --> 01:10:26.610
It has to come out first.

01:10:30.507 --> 01:10:33.368
It can happen without coming out.

01:10:42.786 --> 01:10:45.243
We have to stop it, Skip!

01:10:53.364 --> 01:10:55.814
We have to stop it! Skip!

01:10:56.701 --> 01:10:58.636
Grab the stake.

01:10:58.716 --> 01:11:00.859
- What?
- Grab the stake.

01:11:00.939 --> 01:11:02.415
You have to kill it.

01:11:10.048 --> 01:11:11.269
It's not out.

01:11:11.349 --> 01:11:14.005
It's not coming out.
You have to kill it inside her.

01:11:14.085 --> 01:11:16.454
No! No! No!

01:11:23.227 --> 01:11:25.749
She's transferring to your daughter.
They'll both be dead if you don't.

01:11:25.829 --> 01:11:28.618
- She'll walk this earth.
- No!

01:11:28.698 --> 01:11:30.955
No! No!

01:11:31.035 --> 01:11:33.291
You have to. I can't let her go and do it.

01:11:33.371 --> 01:11:36.867
You have to do it. She's dead either way.

01:11:39.176 --> 01:11:40.964
Do it!

01:11:56.494 --> 01:11:58.543
You failed again.

01:11:58.931 --> 01:12:01.347
- Skip!
- You can't have her!

01:12:20.134 --> 01:12:22.768
- No!
- It's the only way!

01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.725
Oh, God!

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.303
Skip.

01:13:25.383 --> 01:13:26.939
Susan.

01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:29.801
Oh, hey. Oh, hi.

01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:42.220
Release her.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.549
She vessel.

01:13:45.535 --> 01:13:47.257
Please.

01:13:47.337 --> 01:13:49.626
Please, release her.

01:13:50.006 --> 01:13:53.332
You didn't live up to your deal.

01:14:04.154 --> 01:14:05.676
Please.

01:14:06.256 --> 01:14:08.907
Please, release her.

01:14:13.231 --> 01:14:16.815
She will wander Limbo forever...

01:14:19.503 --> 01:14:21.987
...because of you.

01:14:50.733 --> 01:14:52.951
Oh, no. Oh, Megan!

01:14:58.008 --> 01:15:00.257
Dad. Dad.

01:15:01.078 --> 01:15:02.966
Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:15:03.046 --> 01:15:04.868
Oh, it's going to be okay.

01:15:04.948 --> 01:15:07.418
- It's okay. It's okay, honey.
- Daddy.

01:15:07.498 --> 01:15:09.366
It's okay.
