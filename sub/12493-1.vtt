WEBVTT

00:08.166 --> 00:09.375
Well, this is awful.

00:09.875 --> 00:12.250
I can't believe we're spending
Charlie's birthday in jail.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.208
Well, as long as we're
all in here together,

00:15.625 --> 00:16.917
let's go over some ground rules.

00:17.458 --> 00:18.333
This...

00:18.709 --> 00:19.750
is just a chair.

00:21.417 --> 00:22.625
- Well, what if I--
- Uh-uh.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.500
- What if you actually have to go--
- Hold it.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.709
Guys, it could be worse.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.417
Mom and Dad could know we're here.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.250
- Kids?
- Uh-oh.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.583
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.834
Hi.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.709
Hey.

00:38.875 --> 00:40.291
Nice family you got here.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.667
I'm guessing the dog is in the pound?

00:42.875 --> 00:46.041
We don't have a dog, Officer Snooty.

00:46.166 --> 00:48.166
It's pronounced "Snoo-tay."

00:49.333 --> 00:51.208
- Get in there, you two.
- Here.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.250
What are you guys doing here?

00:57.375 --> 00:58.750
What are you guys doing here?

00:58.834 --> 01:00.250
Okay, before we get to that,

01:00.375 --> 01:01.917
let's go over the ground rules again.

01:02.417 --> 01:05.083

02:06.208 --> 02:07.375
Nope, we're good.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.375
Well, what about you?
Why are you guys in jail?

02:10.458 --> 02:12.250
Hey, we asked you first. Start talking.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.208
All right.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.625
Well, as the oldest,

02:16.083 --> 02:17.709
I guess I owe you guys an explanation.

02:18.834 --> 02:19.959
It's all Teddy's fault.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.583
- What? It is not!
- Oh really?

02:21.667 --> 02:23.500
We wouldn't be here
if you hadn't promised Charlie

02:23.583 --> 02:25.083
a birthday present you couldn't deliver.

02:26.083 --> 02:27.250
Well, Charlie, here you are,

02:27.333 --> 02:29.375
watching your favorite
TV show, "The Gurgles."

02:29.458 --> 02:30.959

It's kind of annoying, but I guess
it's entertaining to your little brain.

02:43.041 --> 02:44.500
Oh, "The Gurgles!" What did I miss?

02:45.959 --> 02:47.375
I love Gurgles.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.041
Shh!

02:54.709 --> 02:56.959
So, if we're having a contest
for who gives Charlie

02:57.041 --> 02:58.500
the best birthday present ever,

02:58.583 --> 03:00.000
I'll accept my prize now.

03:00.417 --> 03:01.458
Okay well,

03:01.542 --> 03:03.834
I gave her the gift of life, so, uh...

03:03.917 --> 03:05.375
let's see what you got.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.709
I'm getting her tickets
to the Gurgles concert.

03:08.792 --> 03:09.959
- Oh!
- Yeah.

03:10.041 --> 03:11.709
I want her to have
a great second birthday.

03:12.792 --> 03:16.333
Unlike mine when I didn't get
the gift I wanted.

03:16.417 --> 03:19.583
Here we go, still whining
about a Hello Doggy.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.083
Howdy puppy.

03:23.041 --> 03:25.208
The rootinest tootinest
little chihuahua in the West.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.500
I wanted him more than
anything in the world

03:27.583 --> 03:28.834
and I...

03:29.500 --> 03:30.709
Oh, too soon.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.542
Hey, how are you coming
with the entertainment?

03:38.625 --> 03:40.250
Entertainment. Entertainment?

03:40.375 --> 03:41.959
For Charlie's birthday party.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.667
- What did you decide on?
- Ah.

03:45.542 --> 03:46.542
Still thinking.

03:46.625 --> 03:47.834
Uh... noodling.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.041
A lot of things going on
in the old hopper.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.625
Hopper's empty, isn't it, Bob?

03:53.375 --> 03:55.333
I... I don't even know
where it is anymore.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.583
Honey, Charlie's party is in three days.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.792
Oh, honey, come on, relax.
I'll think of something.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.166
Okay? I... We...

04:02.917 --> 04:05.542
We'll do a clown,
a bouncy house... whatever.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.875
Bob, honey, you have to
reserve those things.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.542
We have to decide on something good,

04:09.625 --> 04:11.834
or it's gonna be Hello Doggy
all over again.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.166
Teddy: Howdy Puppy!

04:19.959 --> 04:21.917
- Hey, can I check my email?
- No no no no no.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.041
I'm about to buy Gurgles
concert tickets online.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.375
They go on sale in eight seconds

04:25.458 --> 04:26.959
and I'm gonna be the first one
to get them.

04:27.041 --> 04:28.500
Okay, here we go.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.959
Three, two, one.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.208
What? Sold out?

04:35.083 --> 04:36.834
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.875
Hang on. Let me get in there.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.166
Let's see.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.750
- What are you doing?
- Checking my email.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.333
What? Give me that.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.000
How am I gonna get the tickets now?

04:49.375 --> 04:53.333
Well, the other day I was listening
to that radio station for kids, K.I.D.Z--

04:54.834 --> 04:57.166
Hey, "kidz". I just got that.

05:00.709 --> 05:03.250
Why are you listening
to the kidz radio station?

05:03.333 --> 05:05.583
Because they told me
not to change the channel.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.417
Anyway, they're having a contest.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.083
Whoever makes the best video
wins tickets to the Gurgles concert.

05:13.166 --> 05:16.083
We could make a great video.
All we need is one good idea.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.792
Oh okay, how about this?

05:18.083 --> 05:21.667
So, we make a video of me putting on
200 pairs of underpants,

05:21.750 --> 05:24.917
and then I turn around
and on my butt it says,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.542
"I heart the Gurgles."

05:26.625 --> 05:27.792
Yeah, that's not it.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.291
I've... I've got an idea.
I've written some really great kid songs.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.834
We could turn one of those into a video.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.792
One good idea. Just one good idea.

05:38.291 --> 05:42.667
I have got a song about talking toes
that will knock your socks off.

05:43.834 --> 05:46.458
You get it? 'Cause it...

05:47.041 --> 05:48.125
Okay.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.125
Okay, we're still going
through all the bad ideas

05:52.208 --> 05:55.000
but we need a good one,
and Charlie should be the star of it.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.291
Well, I've always wanted to shoot her
out of a cannon.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.500
All right, still emptying out
all those bad ideas. It's okay.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.542
No cannons? No underpants?

06:06.875 --> 06:09.125
You're really tying my hands here.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.208
Hey, hey, honey!

06:16.542 --> 06:18.750
Honey! Hey, come on.
Come in here. Come on.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.166
I got something I wanna show you.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.625
What is it?

06:21.709 --> 06:24.417
I wanna show you the entertainment I got
for Charlie's party.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.250
Voila.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.250
A little cart.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.583
This is why I'm missing "Judge Ira"?

06:34.750 --> 06:36.041
Oh, my.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.834
I seemed to have put
the cart before the...

06:44.792 --> 06:45.792
Horse!

06:49.333 --> 06:50.709
Are you sure it's a horse?

06:51.667 --> 06:52.959
I've seen bigger dogs.

06:54.291 --> 06:55.750
Actually, I've seen bigger cats.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.542
Honey, it's a miniature horse.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.000
Well, he is kind of cute.

07:01.583 --> 07:02.542
Where did you find him?

07:03.458 --> 07:04.834
At the stables.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.250
You know, I was gonna get a pony,

07:06.542 --> 07:08.166
and then I met this guy in the parking lot

07:08.250 --> 07:10.166
who said, "I got a deal
for you." And...

07:10.750 --> 07:12.542
Well, after I said
"no thank you" to the speaker,

07:12.625 --> 07:14.000
he brought out shamrock here.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.083
Aw, he's adorable.

07:18.041 --> 07:19.458
Why is his tail going up?

07:19.875 --> 07:21.709
Oh.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.166
So good.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.041
Hey, Mom, we finished the video.
You wanna see it?

07:32.125 --> 07:33.500
Oh, can't wait.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.417
Yeah, we are so gonna win those tickets.

07:35.583 --> 07:36.542
Gurgles!

07:42.250 --> 07:43.333
Good evening.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.125
I'm here with the world's
biggest Gurgles fan,

07:46.208 --> 07:47.500
miss Charlotte Duncan.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.417
Oh no, please call me Charlie.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.917
We're all friends here.

07:53.542 --> 07:57.875
So, Charlie, tell me how you first became
acquainted with the Gurgles.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.625
Well, I was 17... no,

08:02.375 --> 08:03.709
18 months

08:04.709 --> 08:08.291
and I was doing a little bit
of channel surfing.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.542
Charlie: Boring, blah.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.917
Been there, seen that. Then ba-bam!

08:13.709 --> 08:17.166
The most wonderful collection
of shapes and colors I'd ever seen.

08:18.250 --> 08:19.291
The Gurgles.

08:19.375 --> 08:22.625
The Gurgles indeed.

08:27.542 --> 08:31.041
And seeing them in concert
would make me feel...

08:31.542 --> 08:32.542
Well...

08:33.000 --> 08:34.750
why don't I just show you?

08:38.208 --> 08:39.375
Lights, please.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.375
- Teddy: Wow, look at this.
- Amy: Cool.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.250
Wow!

09:12.250 --> 09:14.500
Forgive me. I got a bit carried away.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.709
Now, if we're done here,
I was promised a juice box.

09:21.917 --> 09:24.291
You guys, that was amazing!

09:24.375 --> 09:26.333
Oh, Mom, you made a brilliant Charlie.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.083
Oh, didn't I?

09:28.875 --> 09:30.917
Good show, good show.

09:31.834 --> 09:32.875
Again.

09:32.959 --> 09:34.417
- Yes?
- Yeah.

09:37.917 --> 09:40.625
Hey, honey, you seen
the garage door opener?

09:54.625 --> 09:56.000
Never mind.

09:57.417 --> 09:58.834
What are you doing?

09:59.625 --> 10:01.625
There's a mini-horse in our garage.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.667
Did you really think I wouldn't
take advantage of that?

10:04.417 --> 10:05.667
Where did you go?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.750
Just down the street to Austin's house.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.959
He's been bragging about his new dog.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.125
This shut him right up.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.542
All right, come on.
Get out of there, would you?

10:15.625 --> 10:17.250
Okay.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.375
Oh, here. There you go.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.500
- What is this?
- Tickets.

10:21.917 --> 10:24.542
Did you know you can't text
while riding a mini-horse?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.625
- Bob: Uh, Gabe.
- Yep?

10:28.375 --> 10:30.583
- You forgetting something?
- Oh, right.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.625
Hey, it's three o'clock.
The winning video should be up by now.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.417
I'm on it.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.417
Hey, PJ I didn't know
you were working today.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.959
Oh, I'm not. This is my only clean shirt.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.500
So, why are you wearing the hat?

10:53.583 --> 10:54.667
I don't wanna look stupid.

10:57.417 --> 10:59.166
Oh, it's up.
They've posted the winning video.

10:59.917 --> 11:01.083
Oh, I can't look.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.583
Okay, tell me we won. Tell me we won.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.667
Why aren't you telling me we won?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.834
- Because we lost.
- What?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.375
I don't believe it.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.583
What video could possibly
be better than ours?

11:13.625 --> 11:15.667
How much do I love the Gurgles?

11:24.333 --> 11:25.208
Now,

11:25.250 --> 11:26.667
at this point

11:26.750 --> 11:28.250
a jerk might say...

11:28.792 --> 11:30.000
"I told you so."

11:30.500 --> 11:31.917
I told you so!

11:33.417 --> 11:34.834
So, now what are we gonna do?

11:35.667 --> 11:37.208
Go downtown to the piedmont hotel

11:37.291 --> 11:39.208
where the Gurgles are staying
and beg them for tickets?

11:39.750 --> 11:41.083
How do you know where they're staying?

11:41.291 --> 11:42.917
It was on the
"All-Things-Gurgles" website.

11:45.583 --> 11:46.959
Am I the only one who reads that?

11:48.542 --> 11:52.166
Yes, yes, because you're their only fan
that can actually read.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.917
So...

11:56.000 --> 11:58.375
you're just gonna knock on their door
and they're gonna let you in?

11:58.458 --> 12:00.500
They will if we're delivering

12:00.583 --> 12:03.041
a delicious bucket of chicken.

12:03.125 --> 12:06.000
- Or that stuff you deliver.
- Great! Let's go.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.041
Wait a minute.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.834
How are you gonna know
what room they're in?

12:09.917 --> 12:10.917
Four twenty-three.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.792
I'm an "All-Things-Gurgles"
premium subscriber.

12:23.834 --> 12:27.083
You make a simple rule.
You expect people to follow it.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.458
Teddy: Gabe, she's two. She can't hold it.

12:32.625 --> 12:33.792
Can we turn around now?

12:33.875 --> 12:35.208
Amy: Actually, give me a second.

12:35.458 --> 12:38.333
Unbelievable.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.750
All right, would you please
just finish the story?

12:41.834 --> 12:43.917
You still haven't told us how
you got arrested.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.333
All right.

12:45.417 --> 12:46.959
So, we went down to the hotel.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.792
Stan: Yeah, this is Stan in 423.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.083
I can't find my remote control.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.792
No, I'm not sitting on it again.

13:01.875 --> 13:02.959
Never mind.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.750
It's open.

13:08.583 --> 13:11.125
I can't believe it. It's you!

13:11.458 --> 13:12.625
You're the circle!

13:13.625 --> 13:15.709
You want me
to sign something, five bucks.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.375
You want it in sparkly pen, it's 10 bucks.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.417
No, no. We're not here for autographs.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.792
We wanna ask about concert tickets.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.875
- And we brought chicken.
- Huh?

13:24.417 --> 13:25.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

13:26.041 --> 13:27.750
The other Gurgles put you up to this?

13:28.667 --> 13:30.667
Are they testing me to see
if I'll stay on my diet?

13:31.166 --> 13:32.208
Testing you?

13:33.166 --> 13:35.417
Don't all the shapes love each other
and help each other out?

13:37.625 --> 13:38.959
Yeah yeah, that's it.

13:39.417 --> 13:40.291
Here you go.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.375
So, do you have any tickets?

13:45.458 --> 13:46.750
No. You have any sides?

13:48.041 --> 13:50.083
No ticky, no chicky.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.917
PJ, come on, let's go
find a more helpful shape.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.208
I'll catch up with you.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.834
Listen, circ.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.208
- Heh, can I call you circ?
- No.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.625
Uh, well, the thing is I am a musician

14:05.709 --> 14:08.083
and I wrote a song that is
perfect for the Gurgles.

14:08.834 --> 14:09.875
You wanna hear it?

14:09.959 --> 14:11.125
No, no, no, thanks.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.041
Triangle writes all our songs

14:13.125 --> 14:14.542
'cause he's a genius.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.041
This will only take a minute,
only take a minute.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.000
Ugh!

14:18.083 --> 14:20.000
This is a song. This is a song I wrote...

14:20.083 --> 14:21.583
after I skinned my knee.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.834
♪ What do you get When you pick a scab? ♪

14:24.917 --> 14:26.834
♪ Pick a scab, pick a scab? ♪

14:26.917 --> 14:30.458
♪ What do you get When you pick a scab? ♪

14:30.792 --> 14:33.166
♪ A scar that lasts forever. ♪

14:35.041 --> 14:36.166
You wanna hear another one?

14:36.667 --> 14:40.667
No. Look, kid, I just wanna be left alone
and watch TV, okay?

14:43.542 --> 14:44.709
Oh, nuts.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.250
Okay, I'll be back in a little while.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.208
Where are you going?

14:52.250 --> 14:53.667
Taking the horse for a drive.

14:53.750 --> 14:57.333
I like to see people's faces when he
sticks his tiny head out the window.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.166
Oh! Bob, get out here!

15:01.792 --> 15:02.709
The horse is gone.

15:02.792 --> 15:03.792
We've been rustled?

15:04.166 --> 15:05.667
Dag nabbit!

15:15.500 --> 15:17.041
Are you sure you wanna do this?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.834
I don't like the idea
of sneaking into a concert,

15:19.917 --> 15:21.709
but there's no way
I'm gonna let Charlie down.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.542
And besides, what's the worst
that could happen?

15:24.625 --> 15:26.542
It's not like they're gonna
throw us in jail.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.709
Okay, stop laughing. It's time to get sad.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.500
Think of something really sad.

15:32.917 --> 15:34.750
Okay. Oh, that's good.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.458
- Thinking of Hey There, Poochy?
- Howdy Puppy.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.417
- Next.
- Hi.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.375
- Ticket, please.
- Um, quick story.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.667
- It's actually pretty sad.
- Let me guess.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.583
You're trying to get tickets
for your baby sister

15:46.667 --> 15:48.375
who's the biggest Gurgles fan
in the whole world

15:48.458 --> 15:49.625
and they were sold out.

15:49.709 --> 15:52.000
And now you want me
to just let you guys in.

15:52.959 --> 15:55.041
It's even sadder when you say it.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.625
And here's the saddest thing of all.

16:01.875 --> 16:02.875
Next!

16:08.458 --> 16:09.667
Time to kick it up a notch.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.667
- Ready?
- Ready.

16:13.709 --> 16:15.125
Oh, oh,

16:15.208 --> 16:16.250
oh!

16:16.333 --> 16:18.667
Help help! That boy just collapsed!

16:20.917 --> 16:22.542
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

16:22.625 --> 16:23.834
I know mouth to mouth.

16:24.709 --> 16:25.583
All better.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.959
Hi, I'm Bob. Bob's Bugs Be Gone.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.667
I'm here about the fire ant
problem backstage.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.834
Exterminators, huh?

16:43.917 --> 16:45.125
Why do you have a baby with you?

16:47.500 --> 16:48.625
She's an intern.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.583
- You really think I'm that stupid?
- No.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.667
- Hey, look over there.
- What?

16:56.208 --> 16:57.250
Hey!

17:12.875 --> 17:13.792
Can I help you?

17:15.750 --> 17:16.750
Animal control.

17:17.709 --> 17:18.667
Good.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.333
What happened to your face?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.959
Chipmunks are only cute
in cartoons, ma'am.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.208
Is this your horse?

17:28.250 --> 17:29.917
- Yes. You found him!
- Hey!

17:30.000 --> 17:32.208
Oh my gosh, we've been worried sick.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.166
- Where is he?
- Not so fast.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.917
I'm afraid this animal is stolen property.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.875
What? We didn't steal it.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.250
My husband rented it for our
daughter's birthday party.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.166
Just show me the rental agreement,
we can clear this right up.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.625
I haven't got a rental agreement.

17:48.542 --> 17:50.750
I got a sweaty handshake
and he took off in his dark van.

17:50.834 --> 17:51.875
Seemed okay to me.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.125
Then I'm afraid we have a problem.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.500
No, no, no, hon.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.458
Here's your rental agreement.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.709
Honey, I told you I didn't get one.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.250
Oh, no.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.500
It's right here. Yeah, yeah.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.875
As a matter of fact,

18:10.417 --> 18:12.917
he has two rental agreements.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.083
Are you trying to bribe me, ma'am?

18:20.583 --> 18:21.917
We also have cake.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.250
So...

18:29.667 --> 18:31.250
that's how we got here,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
which only leaves...

18:33.458 --> 18:34.542
PJ.

18:35.166 --> 18:36.500
How did you get here?

18:36.583 --> 18:37.792
Oh.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.250
Cute story, actually.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.834
Um, so, it was after the concert.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.667
I can't believe I went to Yale.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.875
Now, I'm a Gurgle.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.750

19:00.834 --> 19:02.625

19:08.834 --> 19:09.834
That's great, kid.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.792
Oh, you like that one?
I've got plenty of others.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.792
One about talking eyes,
one about talking knees--

19:13.875 --> 19:15.917
Yeah, do you happen to have a song
about security guards?

19:16.125 --> 19:18.000
That's not a good idea for a song.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.291
Oh.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.875
♪ See you later, I'm off to jail ♪

19:31.917 --> 19:34.333
So, I was busted for harassing a gurgle

19:34.417 --> 19:36.333
and stripped of my membership
from the fan club.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.834
Okay, Duncans, you're free to go.
You've been bailed out.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.375
- Bailed out?
- By who?

19:47.166 --> 19:48.250
Gurgle circle.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.208
Yeah, yeah. Biggest moment of your life.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.583
But why did you bail us out?

19:55.667 --> 19:59.375
Well, I played "pick a scab"
for the other Gurgles and they loved it.

19:59.458 --> 20:00.792
I sold a song?

20:00.875 --> 20:02.750
No, I sold a song.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.500
You got bailed out.
Welcome to showbiz, kid.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.542
You know...

20:11.375 --> 20:12.709
I'm gonna miss this place.

20:12.792 --> 20:13.875
Oh, don't worry.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.333
You'll be back.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.750
Well, Charlie, your second birthday
turned out to be pretty memorable.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.208
More memorable than my second birthday,
that's for sure.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.208
Still too soon.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.166
Anyways, uh...

20:34.709 --> 20:36.500
you never did get to see
The Gurgles in concert,

20:36.583 --> 20:39.083
but that's okay because you
have a new favorite show.

20:40.291 --> 20:41.542
Ooh, "The Buttercups!"

20:43.166 --> 20:45.375
But if you ever wanna see
the buttercups in concert,

20:45.875 --> 20:47.041
good luck, Charlie.

20:47.750 --> 20:48.709
Shh!

20:48.792 --> 20:50.041
This is a new one.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.709
Hey, Dad, do you mind if I take
Charlie out for a spin?

20:59.792 --> 21:02.166
Ooh, sorry, Gabe.
We don't have the horse anymore.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.834
But we do have the cart.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.625
Gabe: Faster!

21:16.625 --> 21:18.834
- Okay, say "Cheese."
- Cheese, Mommy!

21:22.583 --> 21:23.583
Giddy up.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.709
Wow. You guys were gone a long time.

21:44.792 --> 21:45.709
Really?

21:45.792 --> 21:47.166
Seemed like 30 seconds.

21:48.208 --> 21:49.709
Oh! Did you see anything interesting?

21:50.083 --> 21:52.041
No, just a bunch of credits.
