WEBVTT

00:06.039 --> 00:09.009
The Darlings are helpless babies
living in a golden playpen,

00:09.076 --> 00:10.943
and Nick's their nanny.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.946
And by the time he's done
cleaning up after them,

00:13.013 --> 00:15.015
there's nothing,
and I mean nothing...

00:15.082 --> 00:17.985
(Scoffs)
Left of him for me.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.019
Nick?

00:19.086 --> 00:21.955
I have made more time
for us.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.024
And I've been
completely supportive

00:24.091 --> 00:26.994
of Lisa wanting to open
her own art gallery.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.029
(Cell phone rings)

00:29.096 --> 00:30.964
(Sighs)

00:31.031 --> 00:32.966
(Beep)

00:33.033 --> 00:35.969
I'm sorry. Can you excuse me
just for one second?
See?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.037
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just--

00:37.104 --> 00:39.006
it's my client
who's on trial for murder,

00:39.072 --> 00:41.008
but she can wait.
(Beep)

00:41.074 --> 00:44.044
You know, many couples find
that creating a special time

00:44.111 --> 00:47.014
free from
workday distractions...
(Cell phone rings)

00:47.080 --> 00:49.950
A meal, perhaps.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.018
(Ring)

00:51.084 --> 00:52.953
(Beep)

00:53.020 --> 00:56.924
Nick. (Sighs)
I told you, Lisa,

00:56.990 --> 00:58.992
after Patrick's
senate campaign is over,

00:59.059 --> 01:02.029
and Letitia's murder trial
is done, things will be easier.

01:02.095 --> 01:05.032
It'll calm down. I promise.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.969
You two probably feel like

01:09.036 --> 01:11.939
you're having
a really hard time.
Mm-hmm.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.941
But you're being honest
with each other

01:14.007 --> 01:17.945
about your dissatisfaction,
and that's--
(Cell phone buzzing)

01:18.011 --> 01:19.947
(Exhales deeply)

01:20.013 --> 01:21.048
(Buzzing)

01:21.114 --> 01:24.985
All right, look. This one I
should probably take. I'm sorry.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.053
(Buzzing continues)

01:26.119 --> 01:27.054
(Sighs)

01:27.120 --> 01:28.055
(Beep)

01:28.121 --> 01:30.057
Hey, Brian. What's up?

01:30.123 --> 01:32.993
You kidnapped our son!

01:33.060 --> 01:35.996
Andrea, our son
stowed away on my jet.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.999
I had nothing to do with it.
You planted
the idea in his head.

01:39.066 --> 01:42.002
The pygmy
has a mind of his own.

01:42.069 --> 01:45.005
And let's face it, unlike you,
is smart enough to realize

01:45.072 --> 01:47.007
he'd be better off here
with me.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.009
I want to be
with both of you.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.011
That's why I stowed away,

01:51.078 --> 01:53.046
and that's why I called Nick.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.016
Your son told me he has
two weeks off from school,

01:56.083 --> 01:59.019
and rather than return to
Brazil, he wants to stay here

01:59.086 --> 02:02.055
in New York,
splitting his time.
Just for the record,

02:02.122 --> 02:05.025
your brother is not exactly
a fair arbitrator.
I'm not partial to Brian.

02:05.092 --> 02:08.996
Yeah, well, back at you, boss.
I'm partial to my nephew
because, like him,

02:09.062 --> 02:12.966
I had to live through years
of my parents' crap,

02:13.033 --> 02:15.002
and it's not fun.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.004
You're two adults.
It's two weeks.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.973
The kid deserves a vacation.
Figure it out.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.009
Nice work.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.011
You've created a situation
where our son

02:24.077 --> 02:27.047
has had to hire a lawyer.
Oh, I created?

02:27.114 --> 02:30.951
What did I just say?
You're the one
who kidnapped him.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.019
Say kidnapped again--
kidnapped!

02:32.085 --> 02:34.021
Why do you deliberately
provoke me?!

02:34.087 --> 02:37.024
I just said don't say kidnapped
again, and you say it!
Hey, how's my favorite felon?

02:37.090 --> 02:39.026
Oh, she needs a tiny favor.
Well, what is it?

02:39.092 --> 02:41.028
I have to go
to the crown regent

02:41.094 --> 02:43.997
to try and settle everything
for pat's election night party,

02:44.064 --> 02:45.999
but after that--
it's about the party.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.035
See, well,
I want to be there,

02:48.101 --> 02:51.972
so if you could get me excused
from my house arrest,

02:52.039 --> 02:53.974
I could be there--
you know, for paddy.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.977
Letitia, do you remember
Ellen's memorial service?

02:57.044 --> 02:58.946
Mm. Didn't come off smoothly.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.948
Brian and I wound up
in jail.
Mm.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.050
So maybe it's best
for our case

03:03.116 --> 03:06.053
if you start acting like
you're actually under arrest.

03:08.021 --> 03:08.989
(Sighs)

03:09.056 --> 03:12.025
Mom-Bo.
Jeremy.

03:12.092 --> 03:15.963
Anything I can do
to help?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.031
(Simon) Help is on the way.

03:18.098 --> 03:20.934
My new fuel,
which I'll be ready to produce

03:21.001 --> 03:22.035
in mass quantities,

03:22.102 --> 03:23.971
suitable
for commercial distribution

03:24.037 --> 03:25.939
within the next decade, will--
(Door opens)

03:26.006 --> 03:28.041
Oh. Hey. Hi.
I can wait outside here.

03:28.108 --> 03:30.978
No, no. You got my message.
Good. Stay.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.980
This won't take a minute.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.048
Ni hao.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.018
(Whispers) Okay.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.987
So what's cookin'?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.956
Last week, I asked you
to marry me.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.959
(Normal voice) I-I know.
(Whispers) It was very exciting.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.028
And I've waited a week
for your response.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.030
But I haven't heard
a word from you.

03:50.097 --> 03:53.967
Obviously you're not ready to
take this to the next level.

03:54.034 --> 03:57.037
(Normal voice)
Really? Right here?

03:57.104 --> 04:00.007
If you're not willing
to respect me enough

04:00.073 --> 04:03.977
to give me an answer when I
ask you a direct question,

04:04.044 --> 04:06.013
we're through.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.948
Forgive me.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.016
What? What?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.952
'Cause we c-c--
we can talk about--

04:12.019 --> 04:14.021
we can talk about
this later.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.057
No, there is no later.
It's over. Done. Go.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.060
Go.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.970
Sorry. Where were we?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.038
Uh, ah, yes.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.108
The world
is changing rapidly...

04:39.112 --> 04:42.950
I need a favor.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.952
Mm. I just
did you a favor.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.954
You're double-dipping.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.022
Mm.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.958
Mm.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.961
My mom wants to go
to Patrick's election party

04:54.027 --> 04:55.028
at the crown regent.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.029
Mm.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.065
Two words--house arrest.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.034
If your mother
was up for murder,

05:01.101 --> 05:03.036
and you asked me
for a hall pass

05:03.103 --> 05:05.939
to go see your brother
win an election,

05:06.006 --> 05:07.941
I'd totally do it.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.943
Jeremy, I can't just go
into the judge's office

05:10.010 --> 05:11.979
and ask for favors
on your mother's behalf.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.981
That's--that would
just be weird.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.049
Not as weird as it would look
if I went to her office

05:16.116 --> 05:19.987
and told her
what you just did to me,

05:20.053 --> 05:22.990
or... what I'm about
to do to you.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.958
Mm.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.027
Who taught you
how to play hardball?

05:27.094 --> 05:28.929
You.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.030
I like it.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.966
(Man) Its been a rocky road
to the senate

05:33.033 --> 05:35.035
for Attorney General
Patrick Darling...
(Carmelita) How can anyone
not trust that face?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.004
You look so honest.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.006
I look so fat.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.008
With voting to begin
in less than 48 hours,

05:41.074 --> 05:43.977
incumbent senator Danielle root
still holds

05:44.044 --> 05:45.946
a narrow 3-point lead
in the polls,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.949
placing her in a statistical
dead heat with Patrick Darling.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.017
Please.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.952
(Turns TV off)

05:52.019 --> 05:53.020
(Sighs)

05:53.086 --> 05:54.988
You're nervous.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.957
I was.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.993
I was a wreck
until you came back.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.030
I don't know how I ever
would've faced this alone.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.032
You got this far
without me.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.967
Barely.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.101
(Chuckles)

06:10.070 --> 06:11.972
What?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.975
I just never thought
I'd be here,

06:15.042 --> 06:18.045
by your side
for your biggest moment.

06:18.111 --> 06:24.051
This... is going to be
our biggest moment.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.989
(Tripp) Going public
with Carmelita?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.959
Are you out of your mind?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.027
I will not
keep her hidden anymore.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.930
Election night,
whether I win or lose, dad,

06:36.997 --> 06:38.966
I'm going public
with our relationship--done.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.968
You do realize, do you not,

06:41.034 --> 06:43.003
that there could not possibly be
a worse time for this?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.939
You say that like there would be
a time that would please you.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.041
What your father is saying,
Patrick,

06:48.108 --> 06:50.978
is that should you win,
this revelation...

06:51.044 --> 06:53.013
Would impair your ability
to govern.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.015
To say nothing of how
it will steal away

06:55.082 --> 06:57.017
the very thunder of a night

06:57.084 --> 06:59.987
that you and I
have been talking about,

07:00.053 --> 07:03.023
have been dreaming about,
for years.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.959
Then again, of course,
that may be your intention.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.028
No, no, no, no. You two aren't
gonna bully me out of this,

07:08.095 --> 07:10.030
not this time.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.967
Carmelita's gonna be there
by my side, and that's that.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.037
Case closed. The end.
See, I'm not like you, dad.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.039
I live from my heart,
not my head.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.041
And that's how
I intend to govern

07:21.108 --> 07:23.977
once I get to Washington.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.947
(Man)
Mr. Darling is in with someone!

07:27.014 --> 07:28.982
Well, well, well. Hello.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.017
Chase.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.019
Patrick. Tripp.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.054
I can only imagine
what I'm interrupting.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.056
Should I call security,
sir?

07:36.123 --> 07:39.059
It's okay. Hello, chase.
We missed you at the funeral.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.061
What's going on?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.963
Nick George,

07:43.030 --> 07:44.965
chase Alexander.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.067
Chase is Ellen's brother.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.002
Been a few years, huh?

07:49.069 --> 07:51.038
So how's it going, chase?

07:51.104 --> 07:54.975
Are you still punishing quail
down there at sandhill?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.977
Tell you the truth, Tripp,

07:57.044 --> 07:58.979
I really haven't had
the stomach for it this year.

07:59.046 --> 08:02.015
Oh, that's too bad.
I was thinking--
I know you killed my sister,
you son of a bitch.

08:02.082 --> 08:05.018
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa. Hey, listen,
I didn't do anything.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.054
Ellen was the one who--
Patrick, that's enough.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.022
She loved you,

08:09.089 --> 08:11.959
and you took her away
from mom and me forever,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.961
and you never even
loved her back.
That is not true, chase.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.996
I know you did something,
you bastards,

08:16.063 --> 08:18.966
and I'm gonna find out.
I'm gonna find out

08:19.032 --> 08:22.002
what you did to my sister,
and you're gonna pay.

08:22.069 --> 08:25.005
You're gonna pay,
you son of a bitch!

08:25.072 --> 08:27.040
(Door closes)

08:27.107 --> 08:32.980
♪♪♪

08:41.020 --> 08:42.990
Well, you have to do something,
Nick. He's obviously nuts.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.958
He's also kind of right.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.994
Oh, that's rubbish, Nick.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.030
Ellen tried to kill my son,
and she died in the attempt.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.032
Her death was accidental.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.001
The events
that occurred thereafter

08:54.067 --> 08:56.937
were affected
only to avert misunderstanding.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.039
The election's tomorrow.
I'm aware of that, paddy,

08:59.106 --> 09:01.975
perhaps even more
than you are.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.046
Well, it's obvious
that chase is agitated,

09:06.113 --> 09:08.048
frantic.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.051
But nonetheless, he's the Uncle
of my grandchildren,

09:11.118 --> 09:14.988
and, well, I--I'm going to
need you to talk to him, Nick.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.057
Find out what he wants.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.026
Make him feel safe.

09:19.092 --> 09:22.029
Okay?

09:26.066 --> 09:29.937
I will see
what I can do.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.972
(Lisa) I love it,
the light. How much?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.975
What kind of clientele
are you prepared to attract?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.043
Uh, I have relationships

09:36.109 --> 09:38.045
with a lot
of major collectors.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.980
Such as?

09:40.047 --> 09:41.982
The Ingersolls,
the Macmillans.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.050
Pretty tight
with Lucy lawless.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.052
Lucy's a major collector now?

09:45.118 --> 09:47.988
Well, anyone with major taste
is a major collector

09:48.055 --> 09:50.023
as far as I'm concerned.
That's just me.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.025
Let me turn on
the lights in here.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.028
Bill gates parks his helicopter
on the roof of this building

09:55.095 --> 09:57.030
when he visits the city.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.000
Bono is a regular
at the Sushi bar.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.003
And I've never heard of you,
or the Macmillans.
My money is as good
as anybody's.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.972
It's not, actually.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.007
You're a first-time dealer
with second-rate clients.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.943
I wish you'd been more
forthcoming when you called.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.045
I wouldn't have wasted
your time.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.047
Thanks.

10:19.019 --> 10:22.022
Hi, I am looking
for chase Alexander.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.057
Well, this is the number
he gave me.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.960
Yes, chase Alexander.
Just--

10:27.027 --> 10:28.962
did he say when he might
be back?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.964
All right, J--tell him
that Nick George called.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.000
He has the number. Okay?
Thank you.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.968
The crown regent hotel called.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.970
Good news only, Daisy.
Good news.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.973
They wish Patrick
the best of luck,

10:40.040 --> 10:41.041
but they've suddenly
become unavailable

10:41.108 --> 10:43.043
for his reception
tomorrow night

10:43.110 --> 10:46.046
due to the political leanings
of the new owner.
Perfect.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.015
And, Nick.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.017
Um...

10:50.083 --> 10:52.019
Karen Darling's here
to see you.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.087
Thank you, Daisy.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.992
Mm.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.962
So what did Simon do now?

11:02.029 --> 11:04.998
Asked me to marry him.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.969
And what did you say?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.038
I didn't say anything
for a whole week. (Chuckles)

11:11.104 --> 11:12.940
Because?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.007
I was thinking.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.010
God, Nick, I've been married
four times. Even I have shame.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.012
So what happened?

11:19.079 --> 11:21.014
He dumped me.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.016
And now
he won't return my calls,

11:23.083 --> 11:25.018
he won't let me see him.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.020
Wow. It sounds like
he really loves you.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.056
He does love me.
Nick, this is my fault.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.058
This is my fault, Nick.
Oh, my God.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.026
I feel so stupid.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.029
You asked me to marry you
all those years ago,

11:36.096 --> 11:40.000
and I just let that offer
slip away, and now Simon.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.970
It's like I marry the guys
I don't love,

11:43.036 --> 11:44.972
and I lose the ones I do.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.974
God.
Would you talk to him?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.009
You want me to talk
to Simon?
Yeah.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.978
No.
Why not?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.980
Because I think
you dodged a bullet.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.015
Look, I don't think
Simon loves you

11:55.082 --> 11:57.951
the way you think he does,
not even close.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.954
Then what's the harm
in it?

12:01.021 --> 12:02.923
Go to him.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.926
There's nothing you love
more than being right, right?

12:05.993 --> 12:09.096
And if Simon doesn't love me,
I'm sure you'll let me know.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.034
Please.
Karen, I--

12:14.101 --> 12:17.004
(cell phone rings)
Hold on.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.939
(Beep)

12:19.006 --> 12:20.073
Hello?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.017
Thanks for meeting with me.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.987
You're not an easy guy
to find.
You alone?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.989
Completely.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.992
So I assume you want me
to shut the hell up

12:39.059 --> 12:41.995
and go away, right?
Not at all.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.997
I just want to hear what you
think happened. That's all.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.968
Okay. You really want
to know?
Mm-hmm.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.038
I think my sister was fed up
with Patrick and his girlfriend.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.007
Oh, yeah, I know
all about her or him.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.944
My guess is Ellen
was gonna leave Patrick

12:57.010 --> 12:59.012
and take the kids,
and then he killed her

12:59.079 --> 13:01.081
or had her killed.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.985
Then he just
dumped her body

13:05.052 --> 13:07.054
in that wedding cake castle
of theirs

13:07.120 --> 13:09.056
and burned it down
to cover it all up.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.992
Divorce--Darling style.
Listen, chase, I know
that you're in pain--

13:12.059 --> 13:14.962
no, you don't know
anything about it.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.030
Now maybe brother's intuition
isn't good enough

13:17.097 --> 13:18.966
to send somebody to jail,

13:19.032 --> 13:21.935
but once I go to the press
or the D. A.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.004
And I tell 'em what I know,
it'll sure make things hard

13:24.071 --> 13:26.006
for Patrick tomorrow.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.041
So you go.
Run and tell Tripp.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.979
Bet he thought he had this
election in the bag, didn't he?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.981
Well, now he's gonna feel

13:34.047 --> 13:35.983
what it's like
to lose something.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.034
Yes, Patrick,
I spoke to him,

13:54.101 --> 13:57.037
and that's as much
as we can do at this point.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.973
Nicky. Oh, you are
such a dear--

14:00.040 --> 14:02.976
moving the entire campaign party
here just for me.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.011
But you didn't need to.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.014
I had just gotten permission
to go out.
Uh, hang on.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.017
What--how--well, how did
you manage that?
Oh, Jeremy took care of it.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.920
Friend of a friend,
he said.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.988
He can be quite charming,
you know.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.957
Yeah, yeah.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.960
Charming's a nice way
to put it. Hey, pat.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.962
Did chase seem unstable
to you?

14:22.029 --> 14:23.997
Is he still threatening
to go public?

14:24.064 --> 14:27.968
Stability is not the first word
I'd use to describe him.
Great. Okay, Nick.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.070
Uh, see you later.
What's wrong?

14:30.137 --> 14:31.972
Nothing.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.975
That was just standard
political ops... for tonight.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.945
It didn't sound like
standard political ops.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.112
Who's unstable?

14:42.049 --> 14:44.985
(Sighs)
What aren't you
telling me, paddy?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.955
Look, if I told you
to trust me,

14:48.021 --> 14:49.022
would you?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.058
You know I would.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.927
Mm-hmm. Trust me.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.095
It's nothing.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.069
(Sighs)

15:06.106 --> 15:08.976
Mona Lisa.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.978
Jeremy.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.980
Gettin' her vote on.
I like it.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.982
Are you
following me again?

15:15.048 --> 15:18.018
Heck no. I'm exercising
my Democratic right.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.020
Besides, you'll be
relieved to know

15:20.087 --> 15:23.056
that my heart
is otherwise occupied.
Oh? With whom?

15:23.123 --> 15:26.960
Sadly, I cannot say.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.931
Don't let it get you down.
Oh. That's not
what's getting me down.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.966
What's the matter,
Nick forget your birthday?

15:33.033 --> 15:35.969
Anniversary?
No! The--the gallery space
I'm wanting to rent.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.971
They rejected me because
apparently I don't have

15:38.038 --> 15:39.006
enough fantastic
celebrity clients.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.974
You never mentioned
yours truly?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.944
The name "Darling" comes up
enough in my life,

15:44.011 --> 15:46.013
thank you very much.
I respect that. I do.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.015
But it was totally
the wrong choice.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.018
Go back to Voldemort.
Tell him I'll be your partner.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.053
No way.
It'll clinch the deal.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.023
And Nick would kill me
and you.
Mm.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.025
Not necessarily
in that order.
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa,

15:58.091 --> 16:01.028
to see you with your own gallery
would be a thing of beauty.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.964
Come on. You know
you were put on this earth

16:04.031 --> 16:05.966
to tell people
what art to buy.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.001
So what if you
need to grease the wheels

16:08.068 --> 16:11.038
with a little Darling oil?
It's just business.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.976
Think about it.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.011
Ciao.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.982
So what'll it be today--

16:22.049 --> 16:23.951
a threat,

16:24.017 --> 16:25.986
request, warning?

16:26.053 --> 16:28.956
Question, actually.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.958
What are you doing
with Karen?

16:31.024 --> 16:34.962
You proposed to her.
You dumped her.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.030
What's your game?

16:40.033 --> 16:43.003
You know what?
I'll tell you.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.974
Karen Darling only wants what
she can't have. Am I right?

16:47.040 --> 16:47.975
Mm.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.977
My guess is,
right about now,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.012
she's missing the hell
out of me.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.948
In about a day or so,

16:55.015 --> 16:57.951
if I ignore all of her
phone calls and her texts,

16:58.018 --> 17:00.988
she'll be ready to beg me
to take her back.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.023
Now when she comes crawling--

17:03.090 --> 17:07.027
and we both know she will--
I'll marry her,

17:07.094 --> 17:10.030
take all the shares she has
of Darling enterprises,

17:10.097 --> 17:13.000
combine them with the shares
I've been steadily acquiring,

17:13.066 --> 17:14.935
and, uh,

17:15.002 --> 17:18.005
take over
Tripp Darling's company.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.041
Okay.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.012
(Chuckles)

17:25.078 --> 17:26.946
(Laughs)

17:27.013 --> 17:29.917
Uh, so why are you
telling me this?

17:29.983 --> 17:31.952
(Laughs) Well, because, Nick,

17:32.019 --> 17:33.954
I trust that you'll take
the information

17:34.021 --> 17:34.988
I've just given you,

17:35.055 --> 17:37.925
and you will put it
to good use.

17:37.991 --> 17:38.959
Hmm?

17:39.026 --> 17:41.028
And--and--and don't forget
to vote.

17:43.030 --> 17:44.097
I won't.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.042
Who'd you vote for?

17:55.108 --> 17:57.010
(Laughs) Come on.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.012
What? Based on your feelings
for the Darlings,

17:59.079 --> 18:00.981
it's a fair question.

18:01.048 --> 18:02.950
I voted for Patrick.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.986
Well, on behalf of
the family, thank you.

18:06.053 --> 18:08.021
(Chuckles)

18:08.088 --> 18:10.023
(Laughs)

18:10.090 --> 18:12.960
Uh... I'm gonna
tell you something

18:13.026 --> 18:14.995
you're not gonna like,

18:15.062 --> 18:17.064
but I want you
to hear me out, okay?

18:17.130 --> 18:19.967
That's an interesting use
of our "special time,"

18:20.033 --> 18:21.034
but okay, go for it.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.037
I can't get the gallery space
that I want, that I need,

18:24.104 --> 18:26.974
unless I use
a celebrity connection,

18:27.040 --> 18:28.041
and, um...

18:28.108 --> 18:31.044
Jeremy offered
to be my partner.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.981
You went to Jeremy
for help?
No. No, no, no.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.984
We ran into each other
when we were voting,

18:37.050 --> 18:39.987
and he said he'd go in
on it with me.
No.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.022
He's not
after me anymore, Nick.

18:42.089 --> 18:44.024
He's fallen
for some other girl.

18:44.091 --> 18:45.959
What girl?

18:46.026 --> 18:48.061
I don't know.
I don't care. I...

18:48.128 --> 18:51.932
Look, I can set boundaries,
Nick. I can handle him.

18:51.999 --> 18:54.067
Actually, you've proven
that you can't.
I already set up
a follow-up appointment

18:54.134 --> 18:57.037
with the owner to try
and convince him--
Lisa, I don't care.

18:57.104 --> 19:00.040
I don't care.
I won't allow it.

19:01.108 --> 19:03.944
I'm just trying
to do something with my life.

19:04.011 --> 19:05.045
Well, then try again.

19:05.112 --> 19:08.048
And why don't you try
doing it in a way that isn't

19:08.115 --> 19:11.051
a tremendous insult to me,
your marriage and your daughter

19:11.118 --> 19:14.955
and all the things that we're
in therapy trying to save?
Me having something of my own

19:15.022 --> 19:16.957
can be
part of saving everything.

19:17.024 --> 19:19.960
Wow. Well, Lisa, if you want
something of your own,

19:20.027 --> 19:22.930
then you should do it
on your own. The answer is no.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.998
Thank you so much
for our special time.

19:35.108 --> 19:38.045
So you met with chase,
you heard him out.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.980
I did.

19:40.047 --> 19:41.982
And his theories, Tripp,
about what really happened

19:42.049 --> 19:43.951
are not that far
from the truth.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.986
Yeah,
he's always been sharp.

19:46.053 --> 19:48.956
He's also desperate.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.958
I found out
that since Ellen's death,

19:51.024 --> 19:54.027
he's lost his job, the bank's
foreclosing on his house,

19:54.094 --> 19:56.964
and the monthly checks
that Ellen was sending him

19:57.030 --> 19:58.932
have obviously dried up.

19:58.999 --> 20:02.970
So he's a man who has
nothing to lose.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.005
Well, methinks
we should offer him

20:05.072 --> 20:08.008
a way out of this cul-de-sac
he's found himself in.

20:08.075 --> 20:10.010
You want me to pay him off?

20:10.077 --> 20:11.945
(Chuckles)

20:12.012 --> 20:13.013
I won't do it.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.047
(Tripp) Hmm.

20:14.114 --> 20:17.050
By not going to the police,
I am already deeper

20:17.117 --> 20:19.953
into this cover-up
than I want to be.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.021
We all are, Nick.

20:21.088 --> 20:23.056
Trust me, I'm not advocating
any further attempts

20:23.123 --> 20:25.125
to cover anything up.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.996
So what do you want me
to do?

20:29.062 --> 20:32.933
Go back to him
with a package--

20:33.000 --> 20:36.003
a combination of
financial relief

20:36.069 --> 20:37.938
in the short run

20:38.005 --> 20:40.941
and a long-term plan
of some sort,

20:41.008 --> 20:42.976
a position
in one of the companies.

20:43.043 --> 20:44.978
He was taking money from Ellen.

20:45.045 --> 20:46.980
This is not
really any different.

20:47.047 --> 20:49.950
So you want me
to pay him off?

20:50.017 --> 20:54.922
I want you
to invite him in, Nick.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.056
He's family.

20:56.123 --> 20:57.991
And Carmelita?

20:58.058 --> 21:01.028
Is pat still dead set on
having her by his side

21:01.094 --> 21:04.031
for his... acceptance speech?

21:04.097 --> 21:08.936
Well, I'll have a chat
with Carmelita...

21:09.002 --> 21:10.938
Myself.

21:11.004 --> 21:13.040
Go to chase, Nick.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.977
Time, I believe...

21:17.044 --> 21:20.013
Is of the essence.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.953
Hi.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.921
I'm sorry I'm late.
I called your office,

21:27.988 --> 21:29.957
and they said you were
already on your way.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.992
That's no problem at all.

21:32.059 --> 21:33.927
(Chuckles)

21:33.994 --> 21:35.963
Uh...

21:36.029 --> 21:37.998
So listen, um...

21:38.065 --> 21:40.968
I talked
with my husband, and...

21:41.034 --> 21:44.972
I'm afraid it's just, uh,
it's not going to work out.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.975
I'm--I'm sorry
for wasting your time.

21:48.041 --> 21:51.011
I'm confused. Your partner's
already signed the lease.
My partner?

21:51.078 --> 21:52.980
(Door opens)

21:53.046 --> 21:55.048
Hello, Mrs. guggenheim.

21:55.115 --> 21:57.050
What--what are you doing,
Jeremy?

21:57.117 --> 21:59.052
Well, I thought about
our discussion.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.988
I called severin,
and voilà...

22:01.054 --> 22:04.024
Welcome to
the Lisa George gallery.

22:04.091 --> 22:07.928
Just sign, here and here.

22:07.995 --> 22:10.931
Uh... I...

22:10.998 --> 22:12.933
I-I-I can't.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.968
I'm sorry.

22:15.035 --> 22:17.070
Excuse me.

22:21.041 --> 22:24.011
Keep this chilled.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.981
Hey.

22:28.048 --> 22:30.050
I'm sorry
for the, uh, ambush.

22:30.117 --> 22:32.920
You know me. I can't resist
a big entrance.

22:32.986 --> 22:34.021
Ah, Jeremy,

22:34.087 --> 22:37.024
I appreciate this,
but I can't.

22:37.090 --> 22:40.027
I talked to Nick
about you helping me,

22:40.093 --> 22:42.029
and he went ballistic.
That's
perfectly understandable.

22:42.095 --> 22:45.999
Doing this
would cost me my marriage.

22:46.066 --> 22:47.968
It's not worth it.

22:48.035 --> 22:50.003
Doing this
won't cost you anything.

22:50.070 --> 22:52.039
Telling Nick
that you're doing it...

22:52.105 --> 22:55.008
You want me to go
behind his back?

22:55.075 --> 22:58.946
I want you to have your cake
and eat it, too.

22:59.012 --> 23:02.049
I mean, come on, Lise.
Who deserves this more than you?

23:03.116 --> 23:06.954
I have wanted this
practically my whole life.

23:07.020 --> 23:09.022
You will totally rock at it.

23:09.089 --> 23:11.992
Yeah. It's not like Nick
denies himself anything

23:12.059 --> 23:14.027
when it comes to his career.

23:14.094 --> 23:15.963
Word.

23:16.029 --> 23:17.030
Oh.

23:17.097 --> 23:20.033
Come on, Lise. Think of
yourself for a change.

23:22.035 --> 23:24.972
Nick can never find out
about this.

23:25.038 --> 23:27.040
He never will.

23:33.013 --> 23:35.115
Let the taste making begin.

23:42.022 --> 23:43.957
(Cell phone rings)

23:44.024 --> 23:45.959
Hey, you're late.

23:46.026 --> 23:49.029
(Voice breaking)
Is Brian Jr. with you?
Why would he be with me?

23:49.096 --> 23:51.965
I can't find him. We were
running late this morning,

23:52.032 --> 23:54.935
and I--and I jumped
in the shower, and I--Brian!
Yeah, nice try.

23:55.002 --> 23:57.938
You were supposed to be here,
like, over an hour ago.
Brian, listen.
I am telling you the truth.

23:58.005 --> 24:00.007
I can't find our son.
Brian!

24:00.073 --> 24:03.010
What if he ran away again?

24:03.076 --> 24:04.945
I'm gonna call the police.

24:05.012 --> 24:06.079
Brian!

24:09.116 --> 24:10.984
(Whistles)

24:11.051 --> 24:12.052
(Door closes)

24:12.119 --> 24:14.054
(Whistles)

24:17.024 --> 24:18.025
(Gasps)

24:18.091 --> 24:21.028
Tripp,
what are you doing here?

24:21.094 --> 24:23.997
Uh, the--the bellboy said
he thought it would be better

24:24.064 --> 24:25.999
if I were to wait inside.

24:26.066 --> 24:27.935
(Exhales) What do you want?

24:28.001 --> 24:29.937
Patrick let me know
that you were planning

24:30.003 --> 24:31.939
to share the stage
with him tonight

24:32.005 --> 24:33.974
at the victory celebration.

24:34.041 --> 24:35.976
Is that a problem?

24:36.043 --> 24:37.044
Well, for me?

24:37.110 --> 24:39.046
Uh, certainly
there are concerns,

24:39.112 --> 24:44.985
but my concerns are secondary
to my... concerns for you.

24:45.052 --> 24:46.954
What concerns?

24:47.020 --> 24:49.022
That your appearance
onstage with Patrick

24:49.089 --> 24:52.993
could give rise to
unseemly questions about you

24:53.060 --> 24:55.996
and about Ellen's death.

24:56.063 --> 24:58.031
Ellen's death?
What about it?

24:58.098 --> 25:00.968
Well...

25:01.034 --> 25:03.036
That's complicated.

25:03.103 --> 25:05.005
Complicated?

25:05.072 --> 25:06.940
(Sighs)

25:07.007 --> 25:09.042
Ellen didn't die
in a fire, did she?

25:09.109 --> 25:12.946
Regrettably, no.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.048
(Sighs) Then tell me
what really happened.

25:15.115 --> 25:17.084
Sit down, my dear.

25:28.095 --> 25:30.030
So your house would be
paid for in full,

25:30.097 --> 25:33.033
college funds for your girls
would be put in place,

25:33.100 --> 25:35.035
established in your name,
and like I said,

25:35.102 --> 25:37.971
if you're interested,
that position

25:38.038 --> 25:41.041
at Darling avionics
could be yours.

25:43.010 --> 25:44.945
You know, you people
make me sick.

25:45.012 --> 25:47.047
Look, chase,
if you really feel

25:47.114 --> 25:50.050
you have to go to the police
or the press with this story,

25:50.117 --> 25:53.053
then I'm not speaking on behalf
of the Darling family

25:53.120 --> 25:56.990
when I say this--
I understand.

25:57.057 --> 25:59.026
I just worry
that the amount of money

25:59.092 --> 26:02.029
you're gonna be offered
for this story

26:02.095 --> 26:04.965
isn't really gonna be enough
to solve your problems.

26:05.032 --> 26:06.934
And we both know
that there's no guarantee

26:07.000 --> 26:09.102
that you'll find the justice
you're seeking.

26:11.038 --> 26:13.006
So the truth...

26:13.073 --> 26:16.009
The truth just doesn't matter
anymore, does it?
No, it's just that
what you think is the truth--

26:16.076 --> 26:18.946
okay, j-just stop, stop.

26:19.012 --> 26:22.950
Okay, just respect me enough
to just stop.

26:23.016 --> 26:27.020
I mean, don't you people...
Know when you've won?

26:28.088 --> 26:30.958
I mean, who am I kidding
anyway, right,

26:31.024 --> 26:32.960
trying to do the right thing?

26:33.026 --> 26:35.095
I got a wife and three kids.

26:38.999 --> 26:40.968
All right.

26:41.034 --> 26:45.072
You can have my silence.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.043
I take it you know where
to find me to send the check.

26:50.110 --> 26:53.113
Yeah, we do.

26:56.016 --> 26:58.051
You know, you sounded a lot
like Tripp Darling

26:58.118 --> 26:59.987
back there, Nick.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.022
He must be so proud.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.971
The polls are about to close,

27:18.038 --> 27:19.973
and hopes remain high
here at the imperial,

27:20.040 --> 27:21.041
the legendary
multistory mansion

27:21.108 --> 27:23.043
that Patrick Darling
calls home.

27:23.110 --> 27:26.046
The candidate has been
behind closed doors...
... with hardly 18% over

27:26.113 --> 27:28.048
the incumbent senator,
Danielle root.

27:28.115 --> 27:31.018
In Oswego county,
a typically blue-collar haven,

27:31.084 --> 27:33.921
Darling is creeping up
with a little over 49%

27:33.987 --> 27:34.988
of the votes there.

27:35.055 --> 27:36.990
If it strikes anyone
as a surprise

27:37.057 --> 27:39.960
that Darling is doing
so well...
Have you seen Carmelita?

27:40.027 --> 27:41.028
No, I haven't.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.030
You put her on the list,
right?

27:43.096 --> 27:44.965
Yeah, she's on the list.

27:45.032 --> 27:46.967
Well, I've left her
five messages,

27:47.034 --> 27:48.035
and she hasn't called back.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.938
You don't think that Tripp--
he just walked in.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.973
Hey, guys.
Dad.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.008
(Nick) Hey.
Returns are coming in.

27:55.075 --> 27:57.010
Excuse me for a second.

27:57.077 --> 27:58.946
Okay?
Yeah.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.013
Jeremy.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.049
Wait up.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.984
Nice work on getting

28:04.051 --> 28:05.986
that temporary furlough
for your mom.

28:06.053 --> 28:07.988
Well, that's me, you know--
Jeremy Darling, power broker.

28:08.055 --> 28:09.990
You know, something like that
requires a motion

28:10.057 --> 28:11.959
from the D. A.'S office,
right?

28:12.025 --> 28:14.027
That crackerjack
legal mind...

28:14.094 --> 28:17.030
You want to tell me who
you're friends with over there

28:17.097 --> 28:19.032
that has
that kind of legal pull?

28:19.099 --> 28:22.002
Whoa. We're serving
domestic limoncello?

28:22.069 --> 28:25.005
Excuse me, Nick.
I gotta go talk to the help.

28:25.072 --> 28:27.007
Jeremy--
this stuff is toxic!

28:27.074 --> 28:29.009
Um, he's about
4 foot tall,

28:29.076 --> 28:31.011
he has a face
like a smurf.

28:31.078 --> 28:34.982
Here's a recent picture,
and he's 4'2" exactly.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.017
And, uh, she's the one
who lost him.

28:37.084 --> 28:38.051
(Gasps)

28:38.118 --> 28:40.087
What? You did.

28:42.055 --> 28:44.958
(Indistinct conversations)

28:45.025 --> 28:46.960
It's looking bad
in buffalo.

28:47.027 --> 28:48.028
Albany's good.

28:48.095 --> 28:49.062
Syracuse?

28:49.129 --> 28:51.031
Still a toss-up.

28:51.098 --> 28:53.934
Did you talk to him?
Who?

28:54.001 --> 28:56.036
Simon.
Yeah. Well, we talked.

28:56.103 --> 28:58.939
And--
well, I don't know
how to say this.

28:59.006 --> 29:00.974
Okay, he's really
calling it off, isn't he?

29:01.041 --> 29:02.976
No, actually,
he wants to marry you.

29:03.043 --> 29:05.979
Oh, God. Nick, thank you.
That's great.
But you shouldn't do it.

29:06.046 --> 29:08.015
Why?
He's using you, Karen.

29:08.081 --> 29:11.919
Simon only wants you for your
shares in Darling enterprises.

29:11.985 --> 29:14.054
It's part of his grand plan
to take us over.
How would you know that?

29:14.121 --> 29:17.024
Because he told me.
Why would he
say that to you?

29:17.090 --> 29:19.026
Albany's a lock.
That's great. Thanks.

29:19.092 --> 29:22.029
You are such a jerk.
Karen, listen,
it's the truth.

29:22.095 --> 29:24.998
You just want to keep me waiting
forever, wishing for you...

29:25.065 --> 29:27.034
No.
Uh-huh, but never quite
having you.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.070
I thought you were
better than that, Nick.
Karen--

29:30.137 --> 29:32.039
what happened to you?
I... (Blows air)

29:32.105 --> 29:35.042
(Sighs)

29:35.108 --> 29:38.979
With 4% of the vote counted,
its too close to call...

29:39.046 --> 29:41.982
Poll watchers around the state
are reporting record turn-out

29:42.049 --> 29:44.985
despite inclement weather
in some of the precincts

29:45.052 --> 29:47.020
around the adirondacks
and Great Lakes.

29:47.087 --> 29:48.956
Its an election

29:49.022 --> 29:50.023
that has inspired voters
of every description,

29:50.090 --> 29:53.927
Poughkeepsie to the Hamptons,
to make their voices heard,

29:53.994 --> 29:55.963
possibly because no one...

29:56.029 --> 29:57.030
You came.

29:57.097 --> 29:58.999
I did,

29:59.066 --> 30:01.001
but I can't stay.

30:01.068 --> 30:04.938
What's the matter?
I know everything.

30:05.005 --> 30:06.006
About what?

30:06.073 --> 30:08.041
Ellen's death.

30:12.045 --> 30:15.949
(Whispering) I...
Did not kill her.

30:16.016 --> 30:17.017
I know that.

30:17.084 --> 30:19.019
I know she attacked you.

30:19.086 --> 30:21.922
I know she slipped
and fell.

30:21.989 --> 30:24.992
I know you moved her body
and burned her

30:25.058 --> 30:27.027
to avoid some scandal.

30:27.094 --> 30:28.962
Who told you this?

30:29.029 --> 30:30.998
It doesn't matter.

30:31.064 --> 30:33.967
What matters is
I can't be with someone

30:34.034 --> 30:36.970
who's capable of taking part
in such a massive lie.

30:37.037 --> 30:38.972
Sweetheart, please.

30:39.039 --> 30:40.941
It's not a discussion,
paddy.

30:41.008 --> 30:42.976
I moved back
after all these months

30:43.043 --> 30:47.014
because I wanted to be
with the man that I loved.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.950
But I don't
know him anymore.

30:50.017 --> 30:51.985
Carmelita, please.

30:52.052 --> 30:55.022
Good-bye. Let me go.

30:56.089 --> 30:57.958
Just...

30:58.025 --> 31:00.027
Tell me
who told you this.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.029
Please, just...

31:02.095 --> 31:04.998
Just tell me that.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.037
I've--I've--I've always believed
he was bound for greatness.

31:10.103 --> 31:13.941
He just carried himself
differently from other children.

31:14.007 --> 31:16.009
Would you all
please excuse us for a moment?

31:16.076 --> 31:18.979
Sure.
My father and I need
to discuss something privately.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.114
Excuse me.
I want to talk to you.

31:23.050 --> 31:25.018
You make me sick.
What's happened?

31:25.085 --> 31:27.054
You told Carmelita?
I spoke to Carmelita, yes.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.990
When are you gonna learn to
stay the hell out of my life?!

31:30.057 --> 31:32.960
It was, in my opinion,
necessary for her sake.

31:33.026 --> 31:35.996
I know how much
she means to you--
so you drove her away?!

31:36.063 --> 31:39.032
Patrick, why don't we deal
with this later?
No, you stay out of this, Nick.

31:39.099 --> 31:42.035
This is a family matter.
Got it?
I didn't drive her away.

31:42.102 --> 31:45.038
Is that right?
Will you
please explain to him

31:45.105 --> 31:47.007
that it would never
have worked out

31:47.074 --> 31:50.010
having Carmelita by his side?
It wouldn't have been seemly.

31:50.077 --> 31:53.947
And it would not
have been safe for her.
What about me, dad?

31:54.014 --> 31:55.949
Why can't you
just finally admit

31:56.016 --> 31:57.985
you've made this election
all about you?

31:58.051 --> 31:59.987
Nick, will you please
explain to him

32:00.053 --> 32:04.992
that what I did
was the right thing to do?

32:06.126 --> 32:08.061
I know that's
how you saw it.

32:08.128 --> 32:09.963
Nick.

32:10.030 --> 32:12.032
Oh, my God.
You can't even convince him?

32:12.099 --> 32:15.035
You pay him
to buy your crap.
Enough, Patrick!

32:15.102 --> 32:17.037
Good lord.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.973
Oh, what now?
Oh.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.975
(Nick) Tripp?
No.

32:22.042 --> 32:23.043
Dad? Oh, my God.

32:23.110 --> 32:24.978
(Tripp groans)

32:25.045 --> 32:26.980
(Guests murmuring)

32:27.047 --> 32:28.949
(Man) Somebody get help!

32:29.016 --> 32:30.017
Tripp? Tripp?

32:30.083 --> 32:31.051
Dad?

32:31.118 --> 32:33.020
Tripp?

32:40.172 --> 32:42.074
No shortage of
behind-the-scenes drama tonight

32:42.140 --> 32:44.109
as just moments ago,
Tripp Darling,

32:44.176 --> 32:47.012
the family patriarch
and father

32:47.079 --> 32:48.981
to senate candidate
Patrick Darling,

32:49.047 --> 32:51.016
was rushed by ambulance here
after suffering

32:51.083 --> 32:53.085
an apparent heart attack.
He was lucky, actually.

32:53.151 --> 32:55.988
The E. K. G. Confirms that
Mr. Darling suffered an M. I.,

32:56.054 --> 32:59.091
but there should be
no lasting damage to his heart.

32:59.157 --> 33:01.059
(Exhales deeply)

33:01.126 --> 33:03.996
(Whispers) Thank God.

33:04.062 --> 33:07.032
(Man) He'll sleep awhile.

33:07.099 --> 33:10.068
I advise you all to go home
and do the same.

33:10.135 --> 33:12.037
Thank you, doctor.

33:12.104 --> 33:14.072
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:14.139 --> 33:17.109
Thank you.

33:19.111 --> 33:22.981
Patrick, mom,
come in here. Quick.

33:23.048 --> 33:24.082
Come on.

33:24.149 --> 33:26.084
(Man) ...Patrick Darlings
flamboyant family

33:26.151 --> 33:28.086
has been featured in headlines
on an almost daily basis.

33:28.153 --> 33:31.023
With 78%
of precincts reporting,

33:31.089 --> 33:33.091
we are calling a winner.

33:33.158 --> 33:36.028
The newest senator
from the state of New York

33:36.094 --> 33:37.963
is Patrick Darling.

33:38.030 --> 33:40.032
It looks like
his native Manhattan

33:40.098 --> 33:44.069
has come through
for the city’s favorite son...
Will wonders never cease?

33:44.136 --> 33:47.039
(Letitia)
I'm so proud of you.

33:47.105 --> 33:49.074
Thank you.
Mm.

33:49.141 --> 33:52.077
Hey, look what I found
at election headquarters.

33:52.144 --> 33:55.047
The fuzz rounded him up.

33:55.113 --> 33:56.081
(Gasps)

33:56.148 --> 33:58.083
Oh, thank God. Baby.

33:58.150 --> 34:00.085
Where the hell
have you been?

34:00.152 --> 34:03.989
Where have you been?
I didn't want to hear you
and mommy fight anymore.

34:04.056 --> 34:06.992
S-so you ran away?
Uh-huh. I took the subway
to coney island.

34:07.059 --> 34:09.995
But then it started
to get dark, so I left.

34:10.062 --> 34:12.063
And I got kinda lost.

34:12.130 --> 34:15.067
Well, the important thing
is that you're safe now, okay?

34:15.132 --> 34:18.003
And you don't
do that again, okay?
Okay.

34:18.070 --> 34:20.005
You don't do that again.
All right.

34:20.072 --> 34:23.141
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

34:25.143 --> 34:27.045
Congratulations, pat.

34:27.112 --> 34:30.047
I know it's not
how you planned it, but...

34:30.114 --> 34:33.018
Thanks.

34:33.085 --> 34:35.987
Look at him--

34:36.054 --> 34:39.024
like Freddy Krueger,

34:39.091 --> 34:41.092
just waiting for a chance
to kill again.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.094
You're angry. I get it.

34:43.161 --> 34:47.065
No. I'm not angry...

34:47.132 --> 34:51.003
Because now I understand
how Tripp Darling lives,

34:51.069 --> 34:54.039
works, operates...

34:54.106 --> 34:56.041
Fully.

34:56.108 --> 34:58.143
Victories have costs.

35:01.079 --> 35:02.981
Maybe I should take

35:03.048 --> 35:05.050
a little less Patrick Darling
down to Washington

35:05.117 --> 35:08.020
and, uh...
A little more Tripp.

35:08.086 --> 35:11.023
Well, that'll make
your father happy.

35:11.089 --> 35:13.091
Oh, no, it won't.

35:29.041 --> 35:32.978
Brian, um, scheduling-wise,
I think you know that I--

35:33.045 --> 35:34.046
tonight is--

35:34.112 --> 35:37.049
yeah, I know, Andrea.
It's your night with him.

35:37.115 --> 35:39.051
I know how eager
you must be

35:39.117 --> 35:42.087
to have another chance
to lose him again.

35:42.154 --> 35:44.056
(Sighs)

35:44.122 --> 35:47.059
No, no.

35:47.125 --> 35:49.061
What I meant was, why--

35:49.127 --> 35:54.066
why don't we just
take him home together?

35:54.132 --> 35:57.102
We need to work this out.

36:00.072 --> 36:02.074
(Whispers) Yeah, okay.

36:07.145 --> 36:09.081
(Man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

36:09.147 --> 36:13.051
Hey. Sorry if I was
a little rough on you before.

36:13.118 --> 36:16.054
No punches thrown.

36:16.121 --> 36:18.023
Kinda progress for us,
huh?

36:18.090 --> 36:19.992
Yeah. Yeah.

36:20.058 --> 36:21.994
Hey, Jeremy,
could you do me a favor?

36:22.060 --> 36:24.062
My phone is dead.

36:24.129 --> 36:27.099
Keep it. I got extras.

36:27.165 --> 36:29.034
Thanks.

36:29.101 --> 36:32.070
(Man continues
speaking indistinctly)

36:32.137 --> 36:35.073
Daddy...

36:35.140 --> 36:38.076
I think I'm kinda in
over my head.

36:38.143 --> 36:42.014
I know you told me not to get
emotionally involved with Simon,

36:42.080 --> 36:43.081
but I did,

36:43.148 --> 36:47.986
and now... Nick is telling me
that Simon only wants me

36:48.053 --> 36:49.988
so he can take over
the company.

36:50.055 --> 36:52.057
(Whispers)
I don't know what to do.

36:52.124 --> 36:54.993
You know, you're gonna
have to learn

36:55.060 --> 36:58.096
how to make decisions
without his help,

36:58.163 --> 37:00.065
because one day...

37:00.132 --> 37:02.034
I know.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.002
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

37:04.069 --> 37:06.071
(Whispering) I know.

37:06.138 --> 37:09.041
Okay.

37:12.077 --> 37:13.011
Bye.

37:13.078 --> 37:14.146
Bye.

37:22.154 --> 37:24.089
Go home. I'll stay.

37:24.156 --> 37:27.059
Oh, no, Nicky.
That's not necessary.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.994
Well, actually, it is.

37:29.061 --> 37:30.996
Your hall pass runs out
in ten minutes.

37:31.063 --> 37:32.030
Oh.

37:32.097 --> 37:34.099
I don't think we want
another nola lyons production.

37:34.166 --> 37:36.101
You make your point.

37:46.144 --> 37:50.015
The last one
by his side, Nicky,

37:50.082 --> 37:52.150
out of everyone...

37:55.120 --> 37:58.123
(Beeping continues)

38:01.126 --> 38:04.062
(Man) It serves us well to
remember that Patrick Darling

38:04.129 --> 38:06.064
is a true American celebrity.

38:06.131 --> 38:08.066
Now lets take a look
at the numbers.

38:08.133 --> 38:10.068
In Oswego county,

38:10.135 --> 38:12.037
it looks like
Patrick Darling has...

38:12.104 --> 38:14.973
Shouldn't you be at
your brother's coronation?

38:15.040 --> 38:16.975
A little over 40%
of the votes there.

38:17.042 --> 38:20.045
No. This is more important.

38:23.081 --> 38:25.083
I'm listening.

38:29.054 --> 38:30.989
I...

38:31.056 --> 38:34.059
(Voice breaks) I'm sorry.

38:42.067 --> 38:44.069
That's it?

38:44.136 --> 38:47.072
No.

38:47.139 --> 38:49.074
Um...

38:49.141 --> 38:52.010
I want to say yes.

38:52.077 --> 38:53.979
(Laughs)

38:54.046 --> 38:57.983
Uh, yes...

38:58.050 --> 38:59.084
To what?

38:59.151 --> 39:04.089
(Sobs) Yes, I'll marry you.

39:08.093 --> 39:12.064
If the offer still stands.

39:29.181 --> 39:32.017
It does.

39:32.084 --> 39:34.086
(Sniffles)

39:47.099 --> 39:50.102
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

39:57.075 --> 39:59.044
(Dialing)

39:59.111 --> 40:03.081
(Cell phone rings)

40:03.148 --> 40:05.984
(Beep)

40:06.051 --> 40:08.086
Hey, sweet cheeks.

40:08.153 --> 40:11.056
Hello?

40:11.123 --> 40:14.092
(Singsong voice) Hello?

40:16.128 --> 40:19.064
(Normal voice) Jeremy?
(Beep)

40:25.070 --> 40:28.106
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

40:29.174 --> 40:34.046
How'd paddy do, Nick?
He win?

40:34.112 --> 40:37.082
Yeah, he won, Tripp.

40:40.085 --> 40:43.021
He won.

40:43.088 --> 40:46.091
(Beeping continues)

40:46.158 --> 40:50.062
(Keane's "love is the end"
playing)

40:50.128 --> 40:52.998
That's quite a day,
for any couple.

40:53.065 --> 40:56.101
A happy ending, at least.
For the Darlings.
What about the Georges?

40:56.168 --> 40:59.004
How about
their happy ending?

40:59.071 --> 41:01.006
I got the gallery.

41:01.073 --> 41:02.040
Yeah?

41:02.107 --> 41:04.042
All on my own.
No help from Jeremy.

41:04.109 --> 41:06.078
I... I was gonna tell you.

41:06.144 --> 41:08.080
Well, that's great.
That is great.

41:08.146 --> 41:11.016
I am very proud of you.
