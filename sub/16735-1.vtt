06:44.036 --> 06:48.140
Here you go, there she be.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.575
Awesome.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.038
It's gnarly.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.175
Man that's massive.

14:00.539 --> 14:06.744
The ridge looks stable but it is
going to be gnarly trying to
figure that shit out.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.113
Looks like pow.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.882
What's that?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.217
Looks like pow.

14:12.384 --> 14:15.954
Yeah, looks awesome.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.793
Let's keep going.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.648
I don't think this is going to
go.

15:19.852 --> 15:20.853
No good?

15:22.321 --> 15:29.327
I think the spines might have to
wait another day.

15:44.009 --> 15:53.084
Oh man this is so not going to
go it is like full on trench
warfare up here.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.887
This seems like a pretty good
way to get worked.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.740
It's getting warm.

21:55.013 --> 22:03.454
Um, I think we have to make a
decision we probably got another
hour if we're lucky?

22:03.622 --> 22:04.989
You're going to bail?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.758
I don't know it's right on the
edge.

22:11.296 --> 22:13.497
I think we should go down.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.399
I'm going to go for it.

22:19.204 --> 22:21.939
I don't know if it's a good call
but...

22:21.941 --> 22:25.609
I'll see you down there.

22:25.611 --> 22:26.911
Okay.

30:34.465 --> 30:38.035
Jimmy do you copy?

30:38.236 --> 30:42.906
Jimmy I'm not reading you? Do
you copy?

34:50.688 --> 34:54.257
You going to drop it bud?

34:54.425 --> 35:00.597
I'm going to take my skins off,
put my skis on and have a look.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.833
Alright man, keep me posted.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.101
Copy.

49:38.976 --> 49:48.017
I'm just going to check your
pupils here... alright, good.

50:12.843 --> 50:13.844
Holy shit.

50:25.555 --> 50:27.055
What was I thinking?

59:46.549 --> 59:47.749
Woo, go Angel!

01:00:54.684 --> 01:01:01.456
Hahaha dancing with it! Way to
hang on in your sluff bud.

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:23.265
These moments make everything
worth it.

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.051
Woo, magnificent.

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:08.035
Jimmy do you copy?

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.605
Yeah I copy.

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:17.445
Uh, I am up here on the
ridge, I don't know it is not
looking so good.

01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:22.283
I am going to bail and down
climb, it is just to warm,
these cornices are sketchy.

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:27.054
Alright keep me posted, be
careful.

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:30.791
10-4 see you back at the camp.
