03:31.411 --> 03:32.878
<i>It</i>'<i>s a mad, mad, mad--</i>

05:29.128 --> 05:31.961
Did you see it,
the way he went sailing right out there?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.067
-He just went sailing out there.
-It was just terrible.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.864
He must have been doing over 80.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.030
An ambulance....
We ought to call an ambulance.

05:42.141 --> 05:43.574
Look at that car.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.873
He must have gone by you
doing 90 miles an hour.

05:46.979 --> 05:50.506
He was passing me!
I never saw such a crazy thing in my life!

05:50.616 --> 05:52.709
-Let's get down there.
-Let's go.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.777
We're going down there.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.685
Russell, be careful.
Remember your condition.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.490
Boy, the way he just sailed out there....

06:03.196 --> 06:05.061
Look out.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.630
There's nobody in the car.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.370
-He's right.
-What do you mean, nobody?

06:12.472 --> 06:13.632
There he is.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.338
Holy smoke!

06:21.013 --> 06:23.413
How about that? This guy's still alive.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.014
He's still alive.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.946
We ought to call an ambulance.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.454
I don't know how he survived,
the way you went sailing right out there.

06:30.823 --> 06:33.690
I'm not a doctor,
but I have some medical experience.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.852
I'm a dentist.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.494
Do you think you're hurt real bad?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.298
Is he kidding?

06:41.534 --> 06:43.832
Hold on, we're gonna get you to a hospital.

06:43.936 --> 06:47.599
You move me, I'll break up in little pieces.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.606
But what a deal.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.807
Look, there's this dough, see?

06:52.445 --> 06:56.245
There's all this dough: $350,000!

06:56.616 --> 06:58.345
Do you hear what I'm saying?

06:58.751 --> 07:01.618
$350,000!

07:02.121 --> 07:06.649
In the park, in Rosita,
Rosita Beach State Park...

07:06.793 --> 07:09.853
...just south of Dago in Santa Rosita.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.059
It's in this box buried under this....

07:16.769 --> 07:18.600
Buried under this big W.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.130
You'll see it.

07:20.406 --> 07:24.308
You'll see it under this big W.

07:24.544 --> 07:28.344
You can't miss it, a big W.

07:28.748 --> 07:32.878
And it's been laying there for 15 years.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.482
He's very sick. He may die.

07:36.689 --> 07:39.214
Listen. I tell you, I'm giving it to you.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.423
And don't let them kid you.

07:42.528 --> 07:47.261
Don't let them give you the business
because it was mine and I paid for it...

07:47.500 --> 07:50.594
...paid for every lousy buck of it.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.097
But watch out.

07:52.371 --> 07:53.804
Watch out for the bulls.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.671
Lousy, stinking bulls are everywhere.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.007
Bulls all over the place.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.505
You just drive down and dig it up.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.573
Dig it all up.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.315
And then you fix yourselves all up.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.114
Fix yourselves all up.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.662
Walk down the street like a king,
back to the old neighborhood.

08:17.263 --> 08:20.061
See the fellas, the dames...

08:20.466 --> 08:23.264
...the dames, all with a big hello...

08:24.136 --> 08:26.866
...a big hello for old Smiler.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.039
Good old Smiler...

08:30.610 --> 08:33.510
...everybody's friend.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.808
Everybody's....

08:42.288 --> 08:46.190
-Aunt Belle, I didn't mean to do it!
-Holy mackerel! Take it easy.

08:46.425 --> 08:50.418
Please, say it don't make
any difference, Aunt Belle!

08:50.530 --> 08:52.691
Please, you got to say....

08:53.199 --> 08:56.691
You got to tell me
it don't make any difference!

08:57.570 --> 08:59.435
For heaven's sake, tell him.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.530
It don't make any difference.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.560
That guy's dead. You'd better believe it.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.060
I believe it, all right.

09:29.168 --> 09:32.160
But if he jumps up again,
I'm getting the hell out of here.

09:32.505 --> 09:36.407
-What a routine he went through.
-Somebody ought to cover him up.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.778
What are you looking at?
All I got is this sweater.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.779
I got a blanket in the truck.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.608
Do you think
there was anything in all that?

09:44.850 --> 09:47.114
He was just raving. He flipped.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.149
This must be the police.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.314
Think we ought to tell them what he said?

09:53.459 --> 09:56.394
Don't say anything or we'll be here all day.

09:56.495 --> 09:59.225
We got to be in Vegas this afternoon.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.390
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.230
My wife and I are on
our second honeymoon.

10:04.337 --> 10:08.467
My wife's up there with her mother.
We're on our way to Lake Mead.

10:08.574 --> 10:11.634
What's to argue about? Just clam up.
Don't say nothing.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.609
This way, we get out of here.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.877
Are you a police officer?

10:25.958 --> 10:26.890
Yep!

10:32.431 --> 10:35.229
-How long ago did this happen?
-A few minutes ago.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.427
About five minutes ago.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.167
Any of you actually see it happen?

10:41.073 --> 10:44.270
-He passed me on the curve--
-Did anybody actually see it?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.937
He was passing me
when he sailed right out there.

10:47.113 --> 10:49.946
-Right over there, up there.
-Who was the first down here?

10:50.049 --> 10:51.380
We all went down.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.217
Was he dead?

10:54.754 --> 10:56.381
Was he already dead?

10:57.823 --> 11:00.519
I said, "Was he already dead
when you got down here?"

11:01.727 --> 11:02.819
Practically.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.424
He was still alive. Did he say anything?

11:08.901 --> 11:12.200
-Did he say anything before he died?
-What about?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.400
What do you mean, "what about?"

11:14.540 --> 11:17.338
Did he say anything
or didn't he say anything?

11:22.181 --> 11:25.150
-He was raving, Officer.
-Raving? What about?

11:26.452 --> 11:28.886
What he said was sort of....

11:28.988 --> 11:30.387
Embarrassing.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.457
What was? Come on.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.954
He thought that this fellow was his aunt.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.859
-His aunt?
-Yeah. His Aunt Belle.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.966
Must have had an aunt named Aunt Belle.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.526
All right!

11:43.469 --> 11:46.802
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?

11:46.906 --> 11:49.739
He didn't make that clear at all.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.402
He didn't make anything clear.
Can we get going?

11:52.511 --> 11:54.411
Just a minute.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.947
I'll get your names
and where you can be reached.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.609
We're on our honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.981
We can't stick around.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.079
We're due in Las Vegas.
We don't know how long we'll stay there.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.591
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma
before I get back to--

12:08.728 --> 12:10.662
We stopped to see if we could help.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.823
We was too late. Let us go, okay?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.798
We'll hold services for him later.
We got our lives to live.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.495
-We ain't had breakfast yet.
-All right.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.302
I'll have to get your name, anyway.

12:22.541 --> 12:23.633
Hold it.

12:25.778 --> 12:26.767
Me?

12:27.713 --> 12:31.205
-Why?
-In case the coroner wants a statement.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.884
J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

12:35.988 --> 12:39.924
I won't be home for a few weeks
but you can get me through my office.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.027
-What'd you say?
-Where is your office?

12:42.528 --> 12:46.396
Pacific Edible Seaweed Company
and it's in Fresno.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.127
-You can call my secretary.
-Ambulance is on its way.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.235
Yeah.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.893
-Is he dead?
-Yeah.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.940
We'd better shift those cars.
They're on the curb.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.009
That's all we can get from this group.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.205
Thank you, gentlemen.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.538
Thanks.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.014
There's an unexpected twist for you.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.017
They're not going to like this
down at Santa Rosita.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.090
-Culpeper's going to scream.
-Yeah.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.563
-We better get our story straight if you--
-What story?

13:22.668 --> 13:25.262
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.

13:25.371 --> 13:26.895
He stopped for breakfast.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.668
He went to the gents' room,
climbed out the back window.

13:29.775 --> 13:33.438
So what? Even Culpeper can't say
we should've been in there with him.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.748
What got me is the way
he went sailing out there.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.145
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be laying there with him.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.617
Poor soul.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.328
Melville, what happened?

13:54.133 --> 13:57.227
We couldn't do anything for him.
Nothing we could do. Come on.

13:57.536 --> 13:58.730
Well?

14:02.942 --> 14:05.706
-It was a terrible thing.
-Russell, I feel sick.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.335
Take it easy. These things happen.

14:07.446 --> 14:10.176
What kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?

14:10.282 --> 14:13.445
They only happen because this country
is full of people...

14:13.552 --> 14:16.385
...who, when things happen,
just say, "These things happen."

14:16.488 --> 14:19.855
-And that's why they happen!
-Let's try not to get upset.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.326
Come on.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.125
We got to have control
of what happens to us.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.926
If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.691
You're right.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.774
Do you know what those half-wit morons
up in Sacramento do about it?

14:38.944 --> 14:42.471
They just sit there
with their big feet up on their big desk...

14:42.648 --> 14:47.017
-...milking 15 million people of as much--
-Listen, I want to say something.

14:47.119 --> 14:50.054
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've got to say something.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.953
-What are you looking at?
-I'm watching something.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.422
Benjy, turn around, sit still.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.860
-Play it straight.
-They're not kiddin'. They went for it.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.156
Yeah? What are you going to do now?

15:01.300 --> 15:04.667
I want you to tell me everything
that man told you, word for word.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.135
Don't leave out anything.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.069
But do you think he really meant it?

15:10.376 --> 15:14.210
Monica, I don't know about anybody else,
but some of them believed it.

15:14.313 --> 15:17.214
Like those two back there.
Don't look over there!

15:17.683 --> 15:21.084
I know where it is. It's under a big W.
That's what he said.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.552
Like a windmill or a waterfall
or something.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.521
I hope it's not under a waterfall.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.925
Think of something that starts with a W.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.719
Wealth. Which.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.896
Let's see. Where.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.633
Work. That's it.
I got to work on where it is.

15:36.735 --> 15:40.193
One thing Dr. Carroll said was
Russell was to have no undue excitement...

15:40.339 --> 15:42.637
...for at least two weeks
because of his condition.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.800
-But--
-That's why we came on this trip...

15:44.910 --> 15:47.674
...so Russell could relax.
You should have told the police.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.442
You keep saying that.
What's the police got to do with it?

15:50.549 --> 15:53.780
I think the police were chasing him.
They drove up so fast.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.878
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?
He was speeding.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.718
I'm only thinking of Russell's condition.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.655
You mean his financial condition,
because that's the only condition he has.

16:03.495 --> 16:07.090
Do you know why your husband
had a nervous breakdown?

16:07.232 --> 16:11.896
It's because he has sunk $40,000,
including $15,000 of my money...

16:12.004 --> 16:15.235
...into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.838
Not only does nobody like it,
it costs $4 a can.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.912
-Yeah, but--
-"Yeah, but," what?

16:21.213 --> 16:23.272
Most people like it and I like it.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.680
I'm working hard,
trying to keep the costs down.

16:25.784 --> 16:27.877
You were working hard
to keep the costs down...

16:28.053 --> 16:31.216
...the day you ran
into the street screaming.

16:31.390 --> 16:34.450
-Mother!
-Emmeline, shut up! And you, too!

16:35.094 --> 16:37.324
Maybe he was playing
a trick on everybody.

16:37.429 --> 16:40.865
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.395
Monica! Practical!

16:43.669 --> 16:47.298
What kind of man is going to play
a practical joke on complete strangers...

16:47.473 --> 16:49.703
...with every bone in his body broken?

16:50.275 --> 16:52.766
-Watch! Watchtower!
-No.

16:53.479 --> 16:54.571
-Wall...
-No.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.341
-Walnut tree.
-No, no!

16:56.582 --> 16:57.776
-Walnuts.
-No!

16:57.883 --> 16:59.350
-In bags.
-No!

17:00.452 --> 17:03.785
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it! See what happens.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.948
-Mother!
-They'll see what we're doing.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.059
Go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.457
Mother, he's not that good a driver.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.874
Going to leave the big boy behind?

17:44.029 --> 17:46.361
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?

17:46.465 --> 17:48.592
It's no use. We can't lose them this way.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.732
The inside of my stomach....

18:06.385 --> 18:08.512
What's that idiot in the truck doing?

18:09.188 --> 18:10.655
What's he doin' back there?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.892
I bet he's running out of gas. Good!

19:03.208 --> 19:04.573
What happened to you?

19:05.177 --> 19:07.839
-Having trouble with your engine?
-Run out of gas?

19:08.180 --> 19:12.276
-What, you bend your tailpipe?
-No. It was just one of my tires.

19:12.584 --> 19:13.983
I thought....

19:14.386 --> 19:16.980
Shucks! Okay, so I was trying to....

19:17.256 --> 19:18.245
Rats.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.881
This whole thing....
I think we're making a big mistake.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.984
-I absolutely agree.
-So?

19:23.395 --> 19:25.556
We're being silly running around like this.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.098
-Sure. We're getting nowhere.
-By george, he's right.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.396
Let's do something sensible.
Let's just discuss this thing...

19:31.503 --> 19:33.937
-...and reason something out.
-I'm with you.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.075
And we can come to some conclusion
like intelligent people.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.040
Let's do that: what he said.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.341
That way nobody will have an advantage
on one another, right?

19:42.447 --> 19:43.607
It's fair.

19:43.782 --> 19:45.511
We'd better get the cars off that curve.

19:45.617 --> 19:48.552
Let's not talk here, but over there.
There's plenty of room.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.212
Fine, see you over there.

19:50.322 --> 19:52.415
Over there.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.760
You're through to Homicide.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.965
Santa Rosita Police Station...

20:01.500 --> 20:02.865
...Detective Division.

20:02.968 --> 20:06.199
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.166
Detective Division. Matthews.

20:08.807 --> 20:12.106
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.944
I'll stay late after school. Who is it?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.174
-Sheriff, Crockett County.
-Who?

20:17.516 --> 20:20.314
-That's where the Smiler is.
-I wonder if anything happened.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.785
Gertie, will you put that call through here?

20:23.155 --> 20:25.146
How about some coffee, Schwartz?

20:33.398 --> 20:35.195
Hello, Sheriff. Culpeper.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.593
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?

20:37.803 --> 20:39.600
Afraid I got some bad news.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.931
-Grogan's cashed in his chips.
-He what?

20:43.141 --> 20:45.735
<i>He crashed his car about 20 minutes ago.</i>

20:46.345 --> 20:48.404
<i>He was making a break, all right.</i>

20:49.348 --> 20:52.146
How did it happen? Where did it happen?

20:53.752 --> 20:58.587
On 39, about 18 miles east
of Danby Junction.

20:58.690 --> 21:02.649
<i>-Nine miles west of Valley Center.</i>
-Were there any witnesses?

21:02.995 --> 21:05.520
<i>A few people went down</i>
<i>to see if they could help.</i>

21:05.697 --> 21:08.860
-Was he killed outright?
-I don't know, but I can find out.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.594
<i>Do that. See what they said.</i>

21:10.836 --> 21:12.804
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.403
It's a great way to start the day.

21:22.314 --> 21:25.477
You wait for 15 years
to solve a really important case...

21:25.584 --> 21:27.279
...and just when you....

21:30.989 --> 21:33.389
It's all right, Chief. I'll get it for you.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.393
He did it again.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.874
Get that fella's number! Get his number!

21:59.151 --> 22:01.642
Get that fella's number! Get his number!

22:07.059 --> 22:11.086
<i>Item: one large furniture van.</i>
<i>Item: one red Volkswagen.</i>

22:11.430 --> 22:13.625
That's them. Call in.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.264
2-1-6-2, 2-1-5-8.

22:16.535 --> 22:19.095
We just made all four of them
parked alongside the road.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.533
They're standing there talking. Over.

22:21.973 --> 22:26.205
<i>Sammy, let that ambulance go.</i>
<i>And stay by the radio.</i>

22:26.645 --> 22:30.547
The man said there was a certain amount
of money buried in this park.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.005
Under a big W.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.775
What is a big W?

22:33.919 --> 22:35.910
We find out, we'll send you a wire.

22:37.322 --> 22:40.655
It's only a possibility
that this man was telling the truth.

22:40.959 --> 22:45.794
If it was the truth, then it is a fact
that this place is almost 200 miles away.

22:46.398 --> 22:48.730
I suggest we quietly get into our cars...

22:49.201 --> 22:52.864
...and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

22:53.105 --> 22:55.539
...keeping in sight of each other.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.275
When we get there, we dig up the money,
providing there is money...

22:59.544 --> 23:02.843
...and if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.609
He's got a point. He's got something.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.776
-I think we should go straight to the police.
-The police? Why?

23:07.919 --> 23:11.753
It's all right, she's with us.
What's this "fair shares for everybody"?

23:12.224 --> 23:16.820
We arrived in four vehicles. I think
we should split it up in four quarters.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.687
Four quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?

23:20.866 --> 23:24.324
You mean you three each get a quarter
and we have to split a quarter?

23:24.669 --> 23:26.796
That's right. What are you trying to pull?

23:26.905 --> 23:30.033
-Seems fair to me.
-Naturally, it's fair to you.

23:30.342 --> 23:35.245
-It just cheats us, that's all.
-$350,000 divided by four is...

23:35.947 --> 23:38.541
...let's say, $87,500.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.275
That's what it is.

23:40.385 --> 23:43.821
The three of you get $87,500
and Benjy and I have to split.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.289
There was five of us down at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.

23:47.392 --> 23:48.654
He's right. We should.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.354
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it
in a five-way manner.

23:51.563 --> 23:54.225
We can discuss it in a five-way manner,
five shares...

23:54.366 --> 23:56.596
...each share would be $70,000--

23:56.701 --> 23:58.328
$70,000?

23:58.537 --> 23:59.526
Holy mackerel!

23:59.638 --> 24:03.631
You realize how many loads
I'd have to haul from Modesto to Yuma--

24:03.742 --> 24:05.232
You're overlooking one thing.

24:05.343 --> 24:07.402
-We're overlooking--
-What little thing?

24:07.512 --> 24:09.844
-What little thing?
-We can all count.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.348
-There were eight of us.
-There were eight of us.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.279
Speaking for my wife and myself,
we'd be just as happy--

24:15.520 --> 24:18.853
Happy with two-eighths instead
of a quarter? Awfully big of you.

24:19.024 --> 24:21.891
Wait a minute, hold it.
Put it back the way it was before.

24:22.194 --> 24:27.063
Either one quarter for each car,
including the van, or one fifth for each guy.

24:27.699 --> 24:31.100
-Just because this old bag has to stick--
-How dare you!

24:32.637 --> 24:36.937
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

24:37.075 --> 24:40.101
-Look, Smiler Grogan...Remember him?
-Yes.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.677
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?

24:43.148 --> 24:45.309
Made his break this morning.

24:45.417 --> 24:49.683
He drove up this way, got to here,
crashed and killed himself.

24:49.955 --> 24:53.118
But before he died,
some people stopped to help him.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.427
They are now stopped here, talking.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.160
I think they're arguing about something.

24:59.998 --> 25:04.230
And a Crockett County unit
has got them under observation.

25:04.736 --> 25:07.364
We give shares to everybody
and for everything.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.663
Now, there are eight of us.

25:09.774 --> 25:12.607
There's eight shares for that.
Then there were four vehicles.

25:12.744 --> 25:15.542
If we give four shares for that,
that's 12 shares already.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.345
There were five of us
who went down to the wreck.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.974
We give five shares for that.

25:20.085 --> 25:21.882
That makes it 17, right?

25:21.987 --> 25:23.852
Now, 17 shares and then we add...

25:23.989 --> 25:26.890
...the same number of shares
as people in each vehicle.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.392
Three for your group, two for yours,
two for us, and one for you.

25:30.495 --> 25:33.020
That adds up to 25 shares.

25:33.164 --> 25:38.101
25 into 350,000 is $14,000 per share.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.267
Figured like that would mean...

25:40.372 --> 25:43.739
...you'd get three shares for being
three people, one for the car...

25:43.842 --> 25:46.470
...one share for going down
and looking at the wreck...

25:46.578 --> 25:48.944
...and three for being
three more people in the car.

25:49.214 --> 25:53.708
A total of eight shares,
giving you $112,000.

25:54.286 --> 25:57.778
That should cover everything,
including the emancipation of women.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.015
Let's see now.

25:59.124 --> 26:02.116
I got one share for being one person...

26:02.294 --> 26:05.786
...one share for going down the hill,
one share for the truck...

26:05.931 --> 26:08.331
...one share for being a person in the truck.

26:08.733 --> 26:13.670
But no matter how you figure it out,
I still don't get as much as anybody else.

26:14.372 --> 26:16.169
Let me explain it once more.

26:16.675 --> 26:21.237
Their group, they, those three of them,
they get $112,000, right?

26:21.880 --> 26:24.940
Those over there, them, they get $97,000.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.877
We, us, we get $84,000.

26:28.086 --> 26:32.022
And you, by yourself, you get $56,000...

26:32.424 --> 26:33.356
...alone.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.450
-That's tax-free money.
-What do you mean, tax-free?

26:36.628 --> 26:40.587
If we go down to this park
and we uncover the money....

26:40.765 --> 26:43.495
I'm sure he's not going to declare anything.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.195
I know he's not going to declare anything.

26:46.304 --> 26:49.933
-I'm not going to declare--
-What are you talking about, declare it?

26:50.308 --> 26:53.106
I mean, it's like non-taxable income.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.869
It's like a gift.

26:55.380 --> 26:58.713
If we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

26:58.817 --> 27:01.183
Otherwise, it's like stealing
from the government.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.181
You explain it to him, please.

27:04.889 --> 27:06.186
Who me?

27:06.424 --> 27:10.258
If we find the money,
there may not be taxes to pay on it...

27:10.362 --> 27:11.920
...because we found it.

27:12.063 --> 27:15.658
-What he was trying to say is--
-Everybody has to pay taxes.

27:16.167 --> 27:20.331
Even businessmen that rob,
steal and cheat people every day...

27:20.538 --> 27:22.165
...even they have to pay taxes.

27:23.041 --> 27:26.101
I give up.
Anybody got a better, fairer plan, go ahead.

27:26.211 --> 27:29.977
There were eight of us there,
so that simply means eight shares.

27:30.215 --> 27:33.082
-Three for us, two for you--
-This is hopeless.

27:33.184 --> 27:36.312
We'll get no place if we continue
listening to this old bag.

27:36.421 --> 27:40.084
Lady, you trying to split us up
so every man's for himself?

27:40.225 --> 27:41.692
And every woman for himself?

27:41.826 --> 27:43.487
One more funny remark from you--

27:43.628 --> 27:46.791
-Let's get out of here.
-Please, don't argue anymore.

27:47.232 --> 27:50.065
We figured it 17 different ways.

27:50.268 --> 27:52.566
Every time we figured it, it was no good.

27:52.671 --> 27:56.163
No matter how we figured it,
somebody didn't like it.

27:56.574 --> 27:59.566
Now there's only one way to figure it.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.440
And that is, every man...

28:01.880 --> 28:04.280
...including the old bag, for himself!

28:04.482 --> 28:07.246
-Good luck and may the best man win!
-Right!

28:07.519 --> 28:11.455
Except you, lady. May you just drop dead!

28:11.723 --> 28:13.657
All right. We all agree on that.

28:14.092 --> 28:18.859
Look, let's be sensible about this thing.
There's money in this for all of us.

28:19.230 --> 28:22.358
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...

28:23.568 --> 28:24.762
...for me...

28:26.004 --> 28:27.164
...and for you...

28:27.572 --> 28:29.199
...and there's enough for--

28:31.209 --> 28:32.471
Melville, my shoe!

28:33.445 --> 28:34.605
Get in the car!

29:03.508 --> 29:08.002
2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2, four cars under observation
are passing this checkpoint.

29:08.179 --> 29:09.942
Lead car is Plymouth station wagon.

29:10.181 --> 29:12.081
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...

29:12.183 --> 29:14.981
<i>...and the Chrysler Imperial convertible,</i>
<i>all doing about 50.</i>

29:15.086 --> 29:17.020
Yep, they're on their way.

29:17.322 --> 29:21.019
<i>-All traveling in the same direction?</i>
-Right. According to my boys...

29:21.192 --> 29:23.717
...they're all
on reckless driving charges already.

29:23.995 --> 29:28.159
None of those people must suspect
that anybody's interested in them.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.428
<i>Now, Sheriff,</i>
<i>will you get on to Capt. Hardesty...</i>

29:31.536 --> 29:33.970
<i>...and see how many helicopters</i>
<i>he can let us have?</i>

29:34.105 --> 29:36.972
I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

29:38.877 --> 29:42.608
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

29:42.814 --> 29:44.441
-I know.
-Where?

29:44.916 --> 29:47.714
-Right there.
-That's right, yeah.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.387
If these merrymakers decide to go for it...

29:51.489 --> 29:54.390
...they'll go to the crossroads
and turn south.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.888
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break...

29:58.029 --> 30:00.520
...if the money is down here somewhere?

30:01.766 --> 30:05.497
Aloysius, the guy is just being clever.
You can't--

30:06.237 --> 30:08.000
5 will get you 10...

30:08.473 --> 30:11.965
-...they turn south at the crossroads.
-You got yourself a bet.

30:26.691 --> 30:28.955
"Mount Shasta National Forest."
Are we near--

30:29.060 --> 30:31.620
That's on the top!
Look down near the bottom.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.296
-Are we near Oregon?
-That's 700 miles from here.

30:50.381 --> 30:51.871
Don't pass it!

30:59.123 --> 31:00.750
You'll lose your license.

31:06.164 --> 31:08.689
We've got the lmperial
and we're running last?

31:08.833 --> 31:10.994
I can't pass them on the curves.

31:11.102 --> 31:13.696
Go on. Go ahead. Look, there's a space!

31:14.472 --> 31:16.838
You waiting for an engraved invitation?

31:17.141 --> 31:19.541
Get over!

31:19.777 --> 31:21.711
Get over to the side where you belong!

32:16.367 --> 32:18.699
I said it before and I'll say it again.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.203
I didn't want to move to California.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.584
-Did you find it yet?
-I can't find it anywhere.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.278
Take the wheel. Give me the map.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.480
Take the wheel! Give me the map.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.751
It must be here.
Right over here. Valley Center!

32:41.859 --> 32:43.053
It's right here.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.924
There's an airfield not far--

32:45.763 --> 32:47.526
Get it off your face!

32:50.201 --> 32:52.726
-Get it off me!
-Don't go in there!

32:52.870 --> 32:55.100
Swing over! Watch out!

32:59.844 --> 33:01.835
-Take it off.
-Get it off!

33:01.946 --> 33:03.504
I've had enough.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.261
-They're going to hire airplanes.
-Never mind. Go!

33:21.366 --> 33:24.733
-But they'll be there hours before--
-I said never mind. Let's go!

33:24.836 --> 33:27.168
Nobody's getting me up in the air.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.480
I wanted to be reasonable,
give them reasonable shares.

33:43.588 --> 33:46.022
No. They wanted every man for himself.

33:46.257 --> 33:49.556
I'm going to show them
what kind of man they're dealing with.

33:57.902 --> 34:00.598
It's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburetor.

34:07.645 --> 34:11.081
When the people who own this see this,
I sure hate to think--

34:11.181 --> 34:13.480
Never mind.

34:13.784 --> 34:17.744
Here's the bike. Get to the nearest phone
and hire the best car you can find.

34:18.589 --> 34:22.581
But this is a girl's bike.
This is for a little girl.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.594
I've got to get this stuff back
so I can lock up the van.

34:25.696 --> 34:28.391
We'll put everything away.
Will you get going? Hurry.

34:29.434 --> 34:30.594
Okay.

34:31.502 --> 34:32.935
I got to admit...

34:34.405 --> 34:36.134
...I feel kind of silly.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.303
You know what I mean?

34:47.351 --> 34:49.251
Will you take us or won't you?

34:49.654 --> 34:51.382
For $250, I guess I will.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.924
You take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here till tomorrow.

34:56.060 --> 34:58.221
-I'll give you a check.
-Check?

34:58.362 --> 35:01.195
Traveler's check from the Bank of America.
Don't worry.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.902
Are you a pilot? Is there a plane around?

35:06.070 --> 35:07.128
Right both times.

35:07.238 --> 35:09.365
Where's an airplane? I don't see any.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.408
There's only one. We've chartered it.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.273
-So you and your friend--
-Did you make a deal with them?

35:14.378 --> 35:17.609
-Right.
-Where can we charter another plane?

35:17.715 --> 35:20.309
-Nearest place is North Valley.
-Where's that?

35:20.585 --> 35:24.214
Other side of Valley Center,
about 12 miles, 15 miles.

35:24.489 --> 35:27.390
-Excuse us.
-Filibuster, filibuster.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.718
You can stick around
and watch us take off.

35:29.827 --> 35:32.295
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.

35:32.430 --> 35:36.389
I hate you so much, I'm not able to tell
you how much in front of your wife.

35:36.534 --> 35:37.865
Vice versa.

35:39.537 --> 35:42.472
Come on over here! Come on!

35:54.418 --> 35:55.407
Good morning.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.351
-Good morning.
-Had an accident?

35:57.688 --> 36:00.486
-Anyone hurt?
-No, but we've got to get to a phone.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.218
Can you give us a lift?

36:02.894 --> 36:05.761
Of course, I should be absolutely delighted.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.361
Upsy-daisy.
I'm afraid you caught me on the hub there.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.837
Madam, do be careful.
I have some cactus specimens--

36:14.405 --> 36:16.430
I'm most frightfully sorry.

36:16.874 --> 36:20.640
I've been gathering some samples
of desert flora.

36:20.811 --> 36:22.301
Where shall I put this?

36:23.681 --> 36:24.875
Boy.

36:26.584 --> 36:28.415
Good morning.

36:29.053 --> 36:32.113
It certainly is. We're in a hurry.
We've got to get to a phone.

36:32.223 --> 36:34.316
Of course, with pleasure.

36:34.425 --> 36:37.485
Jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

36:37.728 --> 36:41.095
Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?

36:41.265 --> 36:43.790
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.

36:44.101 --> 36:45.693
Sounds so foreign.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.837
Really? I say,
we haven't introduced ourselves.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.431
My name is Algernon Hawthorne--
Col. Hawthorne.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.705
-You're a colonel?
-Lieutenant colonel, actually.

36:55.012 --> 36:56.604
My name is Finch. This is my wife.

36:56.847 --> 36:59.281
This is my mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus.

37:00.017 --> 37:02.076
Do stuff those in the back.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.917
Cactus. It's rather a hobby of mine.

37:05.022 --> 37:08.116
Spent the last 10 days
gathering some for my collection.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.285
Nothing spectacular, actually.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.860
<i>Cereus echinocactus, opuntia</i>.
That sort of thing.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.431
Been enjoying a spot of leave
from Vandenberg.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.558
-From what?
-Vandenberg.

37:19.036 --> 37:20.435
The missile place.

37:20.605 --> 37:24.006
I've been attached there
for the last 10 months. Liaison work.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.666
All very hush-hush and whoosh-whoosh.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.246
That sort of thing, you know.

37:32.149 --> 37:34.049
Please, will you look at the road?

37:35.119 --> 37:37.087
Yes.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.395
-Don't stop! Keep moving!
-Mother!

37:45.529 --> 37:48.930
That big stupid lout! He ran into us.
Keep moving!

37:57.241 --> 38:00.039
I won't fly in this old...Listen to it.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.575
Look at how it's shuddering.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.707
Can't we go on our second honeymoon
and forget all about this?

38:06.817 --> 38:10.184
Honey, please, darling.
Believe me, everything is all right.

38:10.288 --> 38:14.622
Do you think I'd take a chance with you
if there was any danger in flying this thing?

38:14.725 --> 38:16.659
This plane is really built.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.256
When was this plane built?

38:19.697 --> 38:20.629
1916.

38:21.198 --> 38:22.130
1916.

38:22.900 --> 38:26.859
1916. These planes are tried and true.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.733
There's nothing experimental
about these planes.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.832
So, come on.
Let's have one big adventure.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.309
Get up there and have some fun.
Here we go.

38:40.518 --> 38:42.816
-That scratched the paint.
-Help!

39:02.973 --> 39:04.770
Haven't you got another car--

39:05.042 --> 39:07.670
What? All right. Thanks.

39:07.778 --> 39:11.214
Are you sure you can't rent us that truck?
I'll pay.

39:11.415 --> 39:13.110
I told you, we can't.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.411
This is our first week open.
How could we do without our truck?

39:16.520 --> 39:18.147
We're in business.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.925
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened--

39:22.026 --> 39:23.618
How can you admit we're involved--

39:23.761 --> 39:27.663
-He'll say he's entitled to a share.
-He would be if he drove us there.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.767
If we don't tell him, he won't.

39:31.635 --> 39:33.728
You're such a genius.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.067
Listen! Only 10 percent!

39:36.173 --> 39:38.403
There's no reason
he should expect any more!

39:51.489 --> 39:54.219
Thanks for stopping.
Can you give me a lift?

39:55.226 --> 39:58.491
What's with the kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?

39:58.629 --> 40:01.894
No. I had an accident.
I got to get to Santa Rosita fast.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.433
Can't help you.
I'm turning off a little way up.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.797
Wait, let me think.

40:06.904 --> 40:10.271
I got to tell somebody.
Could you spare a couple of hours?

40:10.508 --> 40:11.702
Couple of hours?

40:11.809 --> 40:15.006
You've been out in the sun too long.
You're starting to crack up.

40:15.279 --> 40:17.144
Wait a minute. Listen.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.772
Just hear me out.

40:19.850 --> 40:24.219
What I'm going to tell you, you just
ain't going to believe it could've happened.

40:24.321 --> 40:26.846
There was an accident here
a little while back...

40:26.991 --> 40:30.449
...about 20 miles back.
It involved $350,000.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.619
Now, like I say...

40:33.297 --> 40:37.324
...when I tell you this, you just ain't going
to believe it could've happened.

40:38.702 --> 40:40.727
Try me. I'm pretty gullible.

41:21.745 --> 41:24.339
What bothers me is this big W.

41:24.648 --> 41:28.948
You sure you told me all you know?
You don't know what that guy meant?

41:29.186 --> 41:32.519
No, none of them know.
It's just who gets there first.

41:32.723 --> 41:34.816
What do you say? Is it a deal?

41:36.527 --> 41:37.721
Deal!

41:40.231 --> 41:44.600
Kid, you better get that bike out of there.
Somebody could trip over it in the dark.

43:05.883 --> 43:09.046
Fellas, I'm glad you're here.
Look, I need your help.

43:09.186 --> 43:11.711
I had this blowout.
I think a spare's in the back.

43:11.822 --> 43:15.155
It may be a little flat.
Is there an airport anyplace around?

43:15.259 --> 43:18.251
If the spare's flat, don't fix it.
Give me a new tire.

43:18.395 --> 43:20.590
You ain't got a new tire, fix the spare.

43:20.698 --> 43:23.292
But don't look at me, move it.
You could be gassing up.

43:23.767 --> 43:27.999
What is it, a staring contest?
Move, move, will you? Come on!

43:28.672 --> 43:30.230
The pension in my grade...

43:30.341 --> 43:35.005
...has not been upped
one red cent since 1934.

43:39.016 --> 43:41.712
If the Mayor will get behind a resolution--

43:41.819 --> 43:44.720
What can I do?
I can't put any pressure on the Mayor!

43:44.822 --> 43:46.551
You can, Al.

43:46.991 --> 43:48.424
That's the whole point.

43:48.492 --> 43:50.824
This case, I'll have finished by tonight.

43:50.928 --> 43:54.125
It's one of the biggest cases
we've ever had across our books.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.163
Tell the Mayor about it.

43:56.433 --> 44:00.563
Tell him the money is right here,
where I always said it was...

44:00.671 --> 44:02.605
...right in this neighborhood.

44:02.840 --> 44:06.469
Tell him what credit will be reflected
upon the department.

44:06.644 --> 44:10.637
Come on, Aloysius,
get in there and pitch for me.

44:10.848 --> 44:12.748
I can try.

44:14.084 --> 44:15.642
He'll listen to you.

44:15.986 --> 44:19.649
If he gets behind this,
it'll pass unanimously.

44:20.624 --> 44:22.091
Now, you know....

44:22.526 --> 44:24.391
You know, Al, I got it coming.

44:24.728 --> 44:26.889
I'll do everything I can.

44:27.531 --> 44:29.590
-You know that, don't you?
-Yes.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.531
There's just one other little thing....

44:33.137 --> 44:35.037
No. Nothing.

44:35.205 --> 44:36.399
Vacation.

44:36.507 --> 44:40.409
Once I get Smiler Grogan out of the way,
my desk is clear.

44:40.544 --> 44:45.413
I'd like to take a three-week vacation.
Take Ginger on a real nice holiday.

44:46.150 --> 44:48.846
-Is that all right with you?
-Of course it's all right.

44:48.986 --> 44:51.716
Thanks. I can hardly wait to tell her.

44:51.822 --> 44:54.222
-You won't forget about the Mayor?
-No.

44:54.858 --> 44:57.725
I'll do my best. I promise you that.

44:58.562 --> 45:00.928
Aloysius, I'll never forget you for this.

45:01.231 --> 45:04.462
You know something, Al?
I got a feeling this morning...

45:05.135 --> 45:07.296
...that everything's coming my way.

45:16.013 --> 45:17.310
Sylvester!

45:23.754 --> 45:26.518
-Why did you do that?
-Why are you shouting?

45:26.623 --> 45:29.319
-Do you have to scare everybody?
-Are you crazy?

45:29.426 --> 45:30.688
Why didn't I think?

45:30.828 --> 45:32.819
We've been running around like lunatics.

45:32.930 --> 45:36.764
Why didn't I think about Sylvester?
He's sitting there right now.

45:36.867 --> 45:39.802
-He lives on Silver Strand Beach.
-I never thought of that.

45:39.937 --> 45:42.735
-Who on earth is Sylvester?
-My son, Emmeline's brother.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.330
He's a lifeguard there.

45:44.441 --> 45:47.569
I'm not entirely certain
that you haven't damaged this machine.

45:52.816 --> 45:56.274
Kid, don't mind polishing.
I got a lot of cars. Don't bother.

45:56.487 --> 45:58.318
You did a good job.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.219
Have a drink on me. Keep the change.

46:00.324 --> 46:02.087
I took care of your buddy. Let me go now.

46:02.192 --> 46:03.159
You!

46:03.293 --> 46:06.626
No! It's that lunatic
who escaped from the asylum!

46:06.730 --> 46:09.096
Watch him! He's a homicidal maniac!

46:09.199 --> 46:11.326
Get on the phone, yell "Mayday."

46:11.435 --> 46:13.266
Listen to me. I'm a psychiatrist.

46:13.370 --> 46:15.930
This man is insane! I'm not your nurse.

46:16.039 --> 46:17.370
He has a hate complex.

46:17.474 --> 46:19.499
Calm down!

46:20.077 --> 46:22.841
Somebody will stumble
over the bicycle in the dark, huh?

46:22.946 --> 46:26.643
When I finish with you,
they'll be stumbling over you in the dark!

46:26.950 --> 46:28.645
Get on the phone!

46:32.356 --> 46:33.653
Look out!

46:35.926 --> 46:37.325
Look, I was clowning.

46:37.494 --> 46:40.463
Get out of here! Sir, wait a minute.

46:40.597 --> 46:42.792
You've got this all...Why don't you stop?

46:42.900 --> 46:45.494
I tell you. I'll kill you!

46:47.004 --> 46:48.266
You got this...Wait!

46:49.439 --> 46:51.236
Don't take it so....

46:51.341 --> 46:53.901
Will you stop staring and get out of....

46:54.678 --> 46:56.145
He's out of his head.

46:56.814 --> 46:59.647
-He's crazy!
-Want us to call...Ray!

47:00.684 --> 47:02.311
It's a brand-new pump!

47:02.452 --> 47:05.615
-Get out of here!
-Stop that!

47:05.722 --> 47:07.519
Stop that! He's crazy!

47:10.160 --> 47:12.355
Very good. Quick thinking.
I'm proud of you.

47:12.462 --> 47:14.157
Very good. Tie him up.

47:14.398 --> 47:17.299
I'll have some orderlies come by
with a straitjacket.

47:17.401 --> 47:19.961
-Very good. I'm proud of you.
-I never saw anything....

47:20.304 --> 47:22.738
-How many people has he killed?
-There'll be more.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.899
Tie him up for the boys
in the white jackets.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.909
I'm proud of you, boys.
You did a real good job.

47:28.078 --> 47:30.444
Look me up. I'm in the book. Dr. Zillman.

47:32.249 --> 47:35.582
-Sir, we've got to get to Santa Rosita.
-I tell you, this is a club.

47:35.686 --> 47:38.154
We don't do charters.
Nobody here can take you.

47:38.255 --> 47:42.214
-Whose plane is that?
-That belongs to Mr. Tyler Fitzgerald.

47:42.326 --> 47:43.987
He isn't going anywhere today.

47:44.127 --> 47:47.494
-Is he here? Can we see him?
-Mr. Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.

47:47.965 --> 47:52.061
-He's asleep. Nobody can talk to him.
-Can we ask him a question?

47:52.169 --> 47:53.534
No, you can't.

47:54.204 --> 47:56.297
Hello? Wait a minute!

48:00.344 --> 48:03.711
Come on, Benjy.
That must be Mr. Fitzgerald over there!

48:03.814 --> 48:07.511
-You can't disturb Mr. Fitzgerald!
-We just want to talk to him.

48:07.651 --> 48:09.642
-Let him rest, please.
-Hello.

48:09.987 --> 48:12.615
Don't shush me!
We're trying to talk to him.

48:13.090 --> 48:15.183
Wake up, won't you please?

48:16.093 --> 48:18.061
I think he's got a cold.

48:18.295 --> 48:21.230
Mr. Fitzgerald, listen. Please, sir.

48:21.965 --> 48:25.059
We hate to disturb your sleep,
but it's an emergency.

48:25.168 --> 48:27.261
You've no right to crash in here.

48:29.673 --> 48:30.970
That's a head cold.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.634
Mr. Fitzgerald,
you know where Rosita Beach is?

48:33.744 --> 48:37.441
-Only you can get us there.
-It's a matter of life and death.

48:37.614 --> 48:39.377
Right, a matter of life and death.

48:39.549 --> 48:42.382
-It's our grandmother. She's dying.
-Who's dying?

48:42.486 --> 48:45.580
Our grandmother is dying
and she's sent for us.

48:46.290 --> 48:49.748
She's in Rosita Beach.
She's dying and we're up here.

48:50.327 --> 48:53.296
She'd like us with her when she goes.

48:53.563 --> 48:55.394
Otherwise, she won't go.

48:55.666 --> 48:58.999
-She'll go.
-Sir, they forced their way in here.

48:59.102 --> 49:01.900
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.

49:02.005 --> 49:03.939
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.

49:04.041 --> 49:06.771
-How do you do?
-Don't start with that!

49:06.877 --> 49:10.210
Sir, we'd like you to help us out
by taking us down--

49:12.082 --> 49:14.880
-What's the matter?
-Wait just a minute.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.513
I can't see!
Something's happened to my eyes.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.181
I can't see!

49:21.291 --> 49:22.918
You can't see? He can't see.

49:23.026 --> 49:26.962
-Must be an eye cold.
-George, I can't see.

49:27.097 --> 49:30.362
-One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.
-I can't see! George!

49:30.634 --> 49:31.760
George!

49:35.305 --> 49:36.533
Mr. Fitzgerald!

49:37.607 --> 49:40.041
We want to make sure
he doesn't get loose.

49:42.112 --> 49:44.307
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum...

49:44.748 --> 49:47.546
...if I get my hands on him.
What's the matter?

49:48.318 --> 49:49.683
How come I'm tied up like this?

49:49.786 --> 49:52.220
Just sit there. Everything will be all right.

49:52.322 --> 49:54.882
Yeah. Friends are coming
to take care of you.

49:55.025 --> 49:59.223
What friends? What are you talking about?
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.

49:59.529 --> 50:01.224
Take it easy. You've been sick.

50:01.365 --> 50:04.994
Who's been sick?
And where's that bum with the glasses?

50:05.635 --> 50:08.570
Now just sit still,
because the doctor is going--

50:08.772 --> 50:12.640
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?

50:12.776 --> 50:15.506
I'm warning you.
Get this stuff off me, you understand?

50:15.612 --> 50:18.672
-Get this stuff off me!
-Watch him, Ray, watch him!

50:18.782 --> 50:22.548
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again.

50:24.921 --> 50:27.253
My arm! You broke my arm!

50:42.873 --> 50:46.400
You keep this up and I'm going to get sore.

50:52.082 --> 50:56.416
Okay. That's the way you want it,
that's the way you're going to get it.

51:01.124 --> 51:02.421
I'll kill you!

51:06.730 --> 51:10.496
-Help! He's ruining our place!
-Come on, Ray!

51:21.178 --> 51:24.579
-You better get out of here, mister!
-Leave us alone!

51:29.886 --> 51:32.650
-There you are.
-What are we going to do?

51:35.158 --> 51:38.093
Dr. Zillman!

51:49.606 --> 51:54.509
Help! Put me down!
Put me down immediately!

51:58.281 --> 52:01.739
-That's the way you want it?
-Help!

52:09.726 --> 52:12.490
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

52:16.433 --> 52:20.460
You're getting out of line.
I'm not kidding. I've had all I can take.

52:20.570 --> 52:22.470
Irwin, we'll have to kill him.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.639
-Ready?
-Ready.

52:24.741 --> 52:26.003
-Set?
-Set.

52:26.109 --> 52:27.201
Charge!

52:34.084 --> 52:36.644
He's going nuts! He's really nuts!

52:37.787 --> 52:40.688
-Go away!
-You'd better get out of here!

52:41.892 --> 52:43.587
I mean it, I don't want to....

52:47.464 --> 52:49.227
What'll we do?

52:50.033 --> 52:52.627
Go away!

53:55.432 --> 53:57.127
Go, baby, go!

54:31.468 --> 54:32.594
He's got to be home.

54:32.736 --> 54:35.933
He never gets up this early.
Why doesn't he answer?

54:39.876 --> 54:42.674
I hope you won't mind my asking,
but what sort of chap...

54:42.779 --> 54:44.508
...is this brother-in-law of yours?

54:44.614 --> 54:46.172
He's a nut. Why?

54:46.449 --> 54:49.543
I hope he's nothing like my brother-in-law.
Peculiar chap.

54:49.653 --> 54:51.644
Secretary of a golf club
out near Pangbourne.

54:51.755 --> 54:53.017
So what about him?

54:53.156 --> 54:56.683
I was thinking that if Reggie,
my brother-in-law....

54:56.793 --> 55:00.058
If Reggie got hold of information
like this information...

55:00.263 --> 55:02.629
...it's likely that would be the last time...

55:02.732 --> 55:05.963
...anyone would ever see or hear
of dear old Reggie.

55:06.536 --> 55:11.371
I doubt very much whether old Reggie
will be waiting for us in Santa Rosita.

55:13.443 --> 55:14.603
Cheers.

55:20.183 --> 55:22.651
Tyler! Tyler's probably still in the shower.

55:22.752 --> 55:25.880
Tyler! There he is! Tyler!

55:26.289 --> 55:28.689
-Tyler!
-You promised!

55:29.759 --> 55:31.784
I'll wake him up.

55:34.531 --> 55:38.433
Wake up! Come on now!

55:39.169 --> 55:41.194
-Get out of here!
-Wait!

55:42.706 --> 55:44.139
Mr. Fitzgerald!

55:49.546 --> 55:52.777
You think I'll sit still
while some un-American foreigner...

55:52.916 --> 55:55.749
...makes accusations about
my own flesh and blood?

55:55.852 --> 55:58.082
We'll see about that. Stop this car!

55:59.322 --> 56:01.756
-Really, madam.
-Mother, this is awful!

56:01.891 --> 56:04.325
-So we'll see!
-Mother, what are you doing?

56:04.461 --> 56:07.362
You don't trust your brother-in-law?
Let me tell you something.

56:07.464 --> 56:10.160
If my boy is out, then everybody is out.
So we'll see.

56:10.300 --> 56:13.360
We don't even own the car
and you have no right to do what you do.

56:13.503 --> 56:17.769
Rights? You talk to me about rights?

56:19.843 --> 56:22.505
You address me on the subject of rights?

56:25.915 --> 56:27.883
Trouble? Having any trouble?

56:28.284 --> 56:31.412
Yes! And we don't need
any help from you.

56:37.527 --> 56:38.585
Well!

56:39.229 --> 56:42.562
Mother, please.
With all due respect, this is too much.

56:42.665 --> 56:45.133
Give Mr. Hawthorne the keys
or we'll never get there.

56:45.268 --> 56:46.200
Too bad.

56:46.336 --> 56:50.295
Madam, I must say I find your attitude
somewhat less than helpful.

56:50.473 --> 56:54.204
And what's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind telling me?

56:54.344 --> 56:57.973
If we have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair...

56:58.081 --> 57:02.643
...you might be expected to hand me back
my keys so that I could press on.

57:02.752 --> 57:06.813
You keep out of this!
Are we calling Sylvester or not?

57:09.192 --> 57:10.159
No!

57:10.593 --> 57:14.029
We are not. And I'll tell you why.
Because your son, Sylvester...

57:14.164 --> 57:18.362
...is an irresponsible, unreliable,
big loudmouth, no-good bum...

57:18.501 --> 57:20.696
...who, if he isn't a crook,
it's only because...

57:20.804 --> 57:23.830
...he hasn't got the brains or ambition
even to become a crook.

57:23.940 --> 57:24.998
Good show!

57:25.108 --> 57:28.703
If you want to come, you can.
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

57:28.812 --> 57:32.680
But you've got to give us those keys
or you'll force us to take them from you!

57:32.782 --> 57:34.079
Here, here.

57:40.824 --> 57:43.952
Give us those keys.

57:44.194 --> 57:46.560
I don't care where you have them.
I'll get them.

57:46.629 --> 57:48.790
-How dare you.
-Give us those keys.

57:48.898 --> 57:52.163
-You just take one more step towards me--
-I'll take another step.

57:52.268 --> 57:55.533
I'm warning you. You're gonna be sorry!

57:55.705 --> 57:58.640
-Give me the keys.
-You're gonna get it, but good!

58:00.743 --> 58:03.712
-Emmeline!
-Emmeline, stay in the car!

58:04.781 --> 58:06.248
Grab her!

58:09.052 --> 58:11.612
Russell, don't! Mother!

58:12.255 --> 58:14.917
-Put me down!
-Must be stuck.

58:15.492 --> 58:18.256
Russell, you wouldn't.
You couldn't! You shouldn't!

58:18.795 --> 58:21.059
Let me go! Let me get out of here!

58:21.197 --> 58:23.757
I got 'em! Here they are.

58:24.567 --> 58:29.027
We really didn't want to do it.
But that was the only way. Upsy-daisy.

58:30.306 --> 58:31.830
Don't hurt him.

58:35.912 --> 58:38.403
Madam, please! Please!

58:38.515 --> 58:40.278
You forced us.

58:40.383 --> 58:42.681
I'm willing to say I'm sorry,
but you forced us.

58:42.785 --> 58:46.687
-Do us a favor and get back in the car.
-Get away from me! Don't you touch me!

58:46.789 --> 58:49.724
-We had to do it. You saw it, honey.
-Russell, let me go.

58:49.826 --> 58:52.420
Just wait.
You can't manhandle a decent woman.

58:52.529 --> 58:55.020
You're going to jail!
You'll be arrested for assault.

58:55.164 --> 58:58.998
I'm going to sue for everything you've got.
Take your hands off my daughter!

58:59.102 --> 59:01.502
I say, if we are going,
we really must get cracking.

59:01.604 --> 59:02.832
Russell, how could you?

59:02.939 --> 59:04.702
-You know we had to--
-Mr. Finch!

59:04.807 --> 59:08.937
Please don't go. We'll be right with you.
See, she made us do it.

59:09.045 --> 59:11.206
Let's forget the whole thing
and be reasonable.

59:11.314 --> 59:14.306
-Please get back in the car.
-Not me!

59:14.417 --> 59:17.079
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.

59:34.203 --> 59:38.435
The cars are going faster than we are.
Can't you make this thing go a little faster?

59:38.541 --> 59:42.568
Wide open, I can.
But wide open eats up a lot of gas.

59:42.779 --> 59:45.441
Then open up wide. I'll pay for the gas.

59:45.582 --> 59:49.211
-It'll cost you about $50.
-Okay, I'll pay when we land.

59:49.352 --> 59:51.513
-Now!
-I got to pay now?

59:51.654 --> 59:54.555
-Now!
-All right, I'll pay you now.

59:54.857 --> 59:56.188
-Melville....
-What?

59:56.359 --> 59:58.054
A bug! Get him off!

59:58.528 --> 01:00:02.191
Get him off! There he is! Get him!

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:05.665
-You're breaking up the airplane!
-Is it down there?

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.797
Now you're breaking the floor!

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:10.967
Help!

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:14.433
None of these 10 people
have any record at all.

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:17.375
And we're ready to book 'em
for withholding information...

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.313
...causing accidents,
failing to report accidents...

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:24.250
...reckless driving, theft,
at least three cases of assault and battery--

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.288
-Capt. Culpeper?
-Yeah.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:28.289
-That my home?
-Yes, sir.

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:31.460
Sheriff, excuse me. Another call.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.928
Take the Sheriff. I'll take it in here.

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.532
Freddy, transfer Mrs. Culpeper
to Culpeper's office.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.167
-Hello, Ginger?
<i>-Daddy, it</i>'<i>s Billie Sue.</i>

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:47.275
Let me speak with your mother,
sweetheart.

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:51.680
<i>Well?</i>

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.880
Dear.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.845
Tell me something, Ginger.
How does it feel being married...

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:01.549
...to the most brilliant personality
in the law enforcement industry?

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.156
<i>Are you referring to yourself?</i>

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.490
Ginger, I want you to prepare yourself
for a little shock.

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:13.836
-When I tell you what has happened--
<i>-So tell me. I</i>'<i>ve got this biscuit dough--</i>

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.996
The Smiler Grogan case is solved.

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.733
<i>The what?</i>

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:23.474
<i>What the hell is the Smiler Grogan case?</i>

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:28.447
The tuna factory robbery.

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:32.246
The case I've been talking about
for the last 15 years.

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:36.817
All I want you to do
is make all the preparations...

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.995
...for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:43.130
<i>-So what</i>'<i>s the gag?</i>
-It is no gag.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.301
Are you serious about flying to Hawaii?

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:50.799
Flight 7, Sunday morning.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.465
<i>-Are we taking Billie Sue?</i>
-No!

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:59.007
Just the two of us for about three weeks.
Now, we're going to celebrate, Ginger.

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:02.683
My feeling is that after 27 years...

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.680
...we've earned it.

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:23.396
What's the matter?

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:25.736
-I need help. Can you give me a lift?
-What?

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:28.777
My wife is sick.
The doc sent me out for some medicine.

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:29.867
All right. Come on.

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.913
-I just ran out of gas.
-Get in!

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.457
-You?
-You?

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:50.156
Wait a minute. We're in trouble.

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.733
Everybody's in trouble.
Get out of the way.

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.201
You think we wanted
to leave you back there?

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:59.263
-It was my son-in-law and that Englishman.
-What Englishman? Get out of the way.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:03.037
You leave us here,
and you know what you're going to get?

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.273
Nothing! We'll get it all.

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.405
How will you do that?

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:09.451
I'll call my son. He lives about 10 miles
from Rosita Beach.

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:13.784
He'll drive there and get the money
and we're going to have it. That's how!

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:17.290
I was going to offer you a share
for taking us to a phone.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:21.192
But because you're not interested,
we'll wait for another car.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.820
We're making a terrible mistake.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.899
We should go back
and get my mother-in-law.

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.366
-Go back?
-Yes.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.697
You couldn't be serious.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.706
All she has to do is get to a telephone,
my brother-in-law will get there first.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:35.868
They'll get all and we won't get a dime.
You can believe that.

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.675
But look here.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:44.216
Even if she does get all the money,
this won't make any difference...

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.289
...to our agreement.
She wouldn't break her word.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:52.154
I mean to say, I'd still be entitled
to 10 percent as agreed. Surely.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.896
Surely. Come on, let's go.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.983
<i>-Operator.</i>
-Santa Rosita 7-1-9-6-5.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:26.394
...and then that dirty, rotten, slimy bum
that double-crossed me.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:29.692
When I get a hold of that smart aleck,
what I'm going to do....

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:32.562
If you're there, I hope you turn away...

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:35.704
...that's all,
that you just look the other way.

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:39.966
Did you get him?

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:42.510
Maybe he went out
for the papers or something.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.170
We can keep on trying.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:49.208
Just supposing we never do get him?
We might be the last ones there.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.959
Just a minute. Down there?

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.729
You're kidding. It's too steep.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:10.567
I drive my jeep down here every day.
Let's go!

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:11.935
Yeah, let's go. Let's....

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:33.395
You can turn around here.
I sure appreciate this, mister. Thanks.

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.396
Yeah, swell, yeah.

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.465
Hi, Eddie.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.391
I got to get out of here.

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:39.961
Will you ask your father to show me?
There must be some other way out!

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:41.921
Come on! Hurry up!

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:51.303
I could show you a way out.
There's another way to the road.

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:55.705
You know another way to the road?
Good. Come on in. Don't stand there.

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:58.871
If you show me the way out,
I'll give you $1.

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:01.276
-$3.
-$3? Why, you....

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:03.352
Yeah, all right. I'll give you $3.

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:08.014
But don't stand there, hop in the car.
Hurry kid, I got to get out of here!

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.863
-They're not here.
-Probably got a lift.

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:26.839
We only passed six or seven cars
and they weren't in them.

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.876
Somebody must have
taken them the other way.

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:31.538
I think we better go back
to that place we phoned from.

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:33.740
What? That's miles in the wrong direction.

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:35.908
Besides, we can't be certain
they'll be there.

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:39.181
I don't know, I must find my wife.
And I don't know what to do.

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:40.755
Wherever they are...

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:44.223
...surely the most sensible thing
is for the two of us to press on.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.523
For all we know, your brother-in-law
may be out or away somewhere.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:51.530
Even if he were the first there,
he still has to find the money.

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.568
I earnestly recommend
we forget your good ladies...

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.604
...and press on with all possible dispatch.

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:59.401
All right.
We'll press on with all possible dispatch.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:02.238
And I don't really think
that personal rancor...

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:05.745
...is going to help the situation,
if I may say so.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:25.365
Okay, come on, honey.
Let's go. We're here.

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:30.062
We got here first. Let's go.
Come on. I got you.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:31.366
Atta boy, baby.

01:08:31.506 --> 01:08:33.407
We made it. We're here first.

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:35.973
Take care of my car
until we get back, right?

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:40.081
Come on, let's go. Will you go? Come on!

01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:47.916
Over there?

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:49.883
There?

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:52.183
Down there?

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.586
That'll be $2.90.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:30.754
$2.90? Here's $3.00.
Keep the change, but wait for us, okay?

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:32.162
Sure.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:35.497
Wise guy. Come on, let's go.

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:38.939
-No, we're closed. It's 12:00.
-It's 12:00. They're closed.

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.977
Wait a minute!
All we want is a pick and a shovel!

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:44.974
Mr. Dinkler's inside.

01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:47.981
Dinkler. That's it.
We'll get Dinkler. Come on.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.778
Downstairs. Come on.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:56.082
They must be here someplace.
Down here, yeah.

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.861
Look for a pick and a shovel, all right?

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:02.725
Pick and a shovel,
must be someplace around.

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.295
That's all I need.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:08.396
That's all I need, boy.
That's all I need, a pick and a shovel.

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:09.436
I found it!

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:17.810
Got it!

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:20.144
-But there--
-I got it! I found it!

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:28.052
I've no wish to quarrel with you,
but speaking as a representative...

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:31.593
...of Her Majesty's Armed Forces,
I take the most particular exception--

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:34.527
You want me to tell you something?
As far as I'm concerned...

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.825
...the whole British race
is practically finished.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:39.901
If we hadn't kept
your whole country afloat...

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.994
...by giving you billions
you never even said thank you for...

01:10:43.105 --> 01:10:47.132
...the whole phony outfit would be
sunk under the Atlantic years ago.

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:51.712
-What are you stopping for?
-Get out of this machine.

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.441
Get out? You're crazy!

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:56.017
It's my machine.
I'll do as I bloody well please. Out!

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:59.315
I'm awfully sorry.
I've been very edgy today.

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.217
If I said anything about England,
I apologize.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.859
I'm glad to hear you say so.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.124
I must say, if I had the misfortune
to be a citizen of this benighted country...

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:13.292
...I should be most hesitant
in offering any criticism of any other.

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.403
Wait a minute.
Are you knocking this country?

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.597
Are you saying something
against America?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.704
Against it?

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:22.038
I'd be astounded to hear
anything said for it.

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:25.178
The whole bloody place
is the most unspeakable matriarchy...

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.771
...in the history of civilization.

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:30.818
Look at yourself, the way your wife
and her strumpet of a mother...

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.386
...push you through the hoop.

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:35.480
As far as I can see, American men
have been totally emasculated.

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:36.717
They're like slaves.

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:39.089
They die like flies
from coronary thrombosis...

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:42.220
...while their women sit under hair dryers
eating chocolates...

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:46.630
...and arranging for every second Tuesday
to be some sort of Mother's Day.

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:50.466
And this positively infantile preoccupation
with bosoms....

01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:52.798
In all my time in this wretched country...

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:57.345
...the one thing that has appalled me most
is this preoccupation with bosoms.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:00.677
They've become the dominant theme
in American culture:

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:03.946
In literature, in advertising,
in entertainment, in everything.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.883
I'll wager you anything you like...

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.479
...if American women
stopped wearing brassieres...

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:12.117
...your whole national economy
would collapse overnight.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.563
<i>F-7 to Central. The Crumps are locked...</i>

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:18.599
<i>...in the hardware store basement.</i>
<i>Shall I let them out? Over.</i>

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:21.295
How could they get locked in a basement?

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:23.961
-We better let them out.
-That ain't fair.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.337
-It ain't fair? What ain't fair?
-They got themselves in there.

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:31.106
They ought to be able
to get themselves out.

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:34.910
After all, if you help them,
you're not being fair to the others.

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.950
But the moment anybody
gets to where they're going...

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.111
...we'll pick them up.

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:41.485
What difference does it make
who gets there first?

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.921
It's a race, ain't it?

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.685
Why do you want to help that dentist?

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:49.059
Me? I've been pulling for that guy Pike
with the furniture van.

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.155
The rules should be the same
for everybody.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.097
Otherwise, it just ain't fair.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.106
Central to F-7.

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:07.448
No. We'll leave them where they are.
See what happens.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:11.007
Watch all the exits,
but render no assistance. Over.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.289
Are you happy?

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.877
I need a drink.

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:44.384
There's some ice and stuff back there.
Make us all some Old Fashioneds.

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:46.716
You think you ought to drink
while you're flying?

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:48.881
Stop kidding and make us some drinks.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:52.051
Just press the button back there
marked "booze."

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:55.219
It's the only way to fly.

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:15.414
Estimated speed 175.
We'll never be able to keep up with him.

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:19.046
Better have some of the other units
intercept. Over.

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:23.188
Hello, Ginger? What's the matter now?

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:26.294
<i>It</i>'<i>s Billie Sue. Her new boyfriend Oscar...</i>

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:29.795
<i>...was supposed to come down</i>
<i>from Pomona just to meet us.</i>

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:34.096
<i>-So now she told him we were going away.</i>
-What? What's the matter?

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:37.999
<i>You keep forgetting.</i>
<i>If a girl is 6 feet 5 inches tall...</i>

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:40.301
<i>...she</i>'<i>s bound to have special problems.</i>

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:42.343
-But, Ginger--
<i>-They had some argument...</i>

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:43.411
Get out!

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:46.538
<i>...screaming at each other.</i>
<i>Now the whole engagement</i>'<i>s off...</i>

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:48.309
<i>...and she says she</i>'<i>s leaving.</i>

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.748
Leaving what? Leaving home?

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:54.955
-Let me talk to her. Get her to the phone.
<i>-I</i>'<i>ll try. Just a minute.</i>

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:58.720
<i>-Talk to your father.</i>
<i>-I won</i>'<i>t. I don</i>'<i>t want to talk to him ever.</i>

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:02.662
<i>Don</i>'<i>t be ridiculous.</i>
<i>Whatever else he is, he is your father.</i>

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.359
You hear bells, baby?

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:14.969
Yes?

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:18.005
<i>-Who is that?</i>
-Who's that?

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:19.798
I want my son!

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:25.973
Who is that?
I want to speak to Sylvester Marcus.

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:29.145
-Sylvester?
-Yeah, baby?

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:30.841
It's your mom.

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.891
Good old Mom. Hello!

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:39.619
-Sylvester?
<i>-Is that you, Mom?</i>

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:42.288
Of course it's me.
I've been trying you all morning.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.499
I've been a little busy.

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:47.996
I've been working
and I didn't hear the phone.

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.070
Hold on a minute, will you, Mom?

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:53.833
Baby, how about a beer or something?
Man, I feel like--

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:56.172
Will you listen? Something's happened.

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:59.275
<i>There was an accident this morning.</i>
<i>A man got killedl</i>

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:00.974
Who got killed?

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.812
<i>-Now, listenl</i>
-You all right?

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.442
<i>-Pay attentionl</i>
-Sis all right?

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.248
<i>-Will you listen?</i>
-What's wrong?

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:07.754
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.751
There's a whole fortune in cash.

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:13.122
You can get it before anybody else,
but you've got to hurry!

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:16.455
What's the matter?
What's going on there? Are you all right?

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:18.566
Of course I'm all right.

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.763
Are Russell and Emmeline with you?

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:24.838
Forget about Russell.
Will you shut up and let me talk?

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.337
What's going on? Where's Russell?

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.237
Don't even mention Russell!

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:32.745
-When I tell you what Russell did--
-Just tell him about the dough.

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:34.509
Keep out of this! Shut up!

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:37.282
<i>-Don</i>'<i>t talk. Just listen.</i>
-What did Russell do?

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:41.219
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me beside the road.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.551
He and this Englishman I don't even know!

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:46.089
Who's with you and where are you?

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:49.922
I'm with this truck driver
in Peterson's Garage in Plaster City.

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:52.863
Will you shut up a minute
so I can tell you what happened?

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:57.462
Listen to me close! Stay there,
'cause I'm coming to get you right now.

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:58.740
Shut up and listen!

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.073
Everything's going to be all right.
Your baby's coming to get you.

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:03.906
Sit there. Relax. Take it easy.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:07.746
I'm coming.
Everything's going to be all right.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:12.911
Well?

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:17.757
So he's coming here,
and I'm not to worry about a thing.

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:20.891
Because everything is going to be all right.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:26.391
Exactly like your father:
a big, stupid, muscle-headed moron!

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:29.160
The burglar alarm.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.868
We just throw it on, people hear it,
they come, and we're out.

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:35.738
Don't be frightened
if it makes a big bell noise.

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.675
Okay? All right? Here we go.

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:46.009
-I don't hear anything.
-Neither do I. There's no bell.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.024
Look at it. It just stands there.

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:55.762
Wait a minute.

01:18:57.632 --> 01:18:58.894
Stand back.

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:16.613
Burglar alarm!

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:19.016
The stupidest burglar in the world
could come in...

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:22.488
...and walk away with everything,
and we can't even get out.

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:26.191
Come here!

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:41.673
Even if you do get the bell to ring
and somebody comes...

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:43.333
...what about the damage?

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.140
They're the ones who locked us in!

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.753
This thing has got to work.

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.015
No!

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:03.663
Please, help me! I'm frying!
Please! Help me!

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:19.576
Don't make them so sweet this time.

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:22.809
You've had two already.
Can't you wait till we're on the ground?

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:25.546
What are you talking about?
I'll make the next batch.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.121
You take the controls.

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:30.851
-I don't know how to fly an airplane.
-There's really nothing to it.

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:35.328
-But Benjy can't fly!
-That's nonsense. Anybody can fly a plane.

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:38.796
I'll check you out.
Put your little hands on the wheel.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.698
That's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder.

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.737
There you are, feet on the rudder.

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:47.035
Who says this boy can't fly a plane?
There you go.

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.766
I'm making an Old Fashioned
the old-fashioned way...

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.937
...the way dear old Dad used to.

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.705
What if something happens?

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:56.841
What can happen
to an Old Fashioned, all right?

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:02.320
I know you don't know what to do,
so don't do nothing.

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:06.360
-I won't do nothing.
-That boy's a natural-born flyer.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:20.536
Wait a minute. Ease back on her!

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.540
-I'm easing.
-Ease back a little!

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:25.807
-I'm trying my best.
-All kidding aside--

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:28.842
I'm not kidding any longer.
It's making me...

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:32.678
...nervous!
We've got an accident back here!

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:34.118
-What happened?
-I don't know!

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:44.823
It's good that truck pulled over.
I can't stand this anymore.

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:47.025
In the name of reason,
pull yourself together.

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.601
You were 10 feet over the line.

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:31.979
So it's fisticuffs you want, is it?
Right. Stick them up!

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.207
-No! No!
-Come here, you coward!

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:35.815
No! Don't hit me!

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:38.249
-Stop, you!
-Don't hit me!

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:45.583
-Blood.
-It certainly is.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.826
Come back here, you blimey....

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:56.567
You want to play it dirty? Okay!

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:01.902
Foul!

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:03.034
You're not much good...

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:06.671
...without that horrible
mother-in-law of yours, are you?

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:10.782
Come on. Fight!

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.445
You thought you had me, didn't you?

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:15.278
I'll kill you. I swear!

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:19.421
No, stop, please! No, please.

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:35.970
-Hello. Hello there.
-Don't shut the motor off!

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:39.410
I'm not shutting anything off!
Hello, anybody! Can anybody hear me?

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:43.142
-I can hear you!
-I don't care if you hear me!

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:47.677
-I don't know whether we're on the air.
-Mayday. Call mayday!

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:51.953
Mayday! Mayday, we're up here!
Can you hear us? Help!

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.085
-Benjy, say something.
-Help!

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.863
Hello? Billie Sue?

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:01.898
-Billie Sue, where are you?
<i>-I</i>'<i>m at the bus station.</i>

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:04.335
<i>I only called because</i>
<i>Mommy said I absolutely--</i>

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:08.505
Sweetie, what are you doing
in the bus station?

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.578
<i>I</i>'<i>m waiting for the bus.</i>

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:13.073
Your wife's on the other phone.

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:17.645
Ginger?
I've got Billie Sue on the other line.

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:20.243
Billie Sue, wait one minute, will you?

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.516
-Ginger?
<i>-I</i>'<i>m here.</i>

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:25.252
Can you hear Billie Sue? She's crying.

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:30.254
She's in the bus station and she's crying,
but she's waiting for you to tell her.

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:32.866
<i>-Billie Suel</i>
-Are you listening?

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:37.493
-Are you listening to your mother?
<i>-Your mother is speaking.</i>

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:40.506
-Listen to your mother, sweetie.
<i>-Billie Suel</i>

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:43.235
Billie Sue! Listen to your mother!

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:51.042
Everything that's happened
to my daughter and me today...

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:54.178
...only happened for one reason:
because you were too stupid...

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:57.156
...to look where you were going,
and wrecked our car!

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.486
Yeah?

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:12.062
You either get out of that truck
or I'm going to throw you out.

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:13.799
Don't get upset.

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:17.435
You're not going to do anything.
Drive on, you big, stupid idiot.

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:22.649
Mommy, don't worry.
Your baby's coming to save you!

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:30.250
Mr. Pike, please!

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:33.691
-Let me go! Get away from me!
-That isn't nice a bit!

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:35.422
Mother!

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:52.675
That's what I'm here for.
That's why you had me, to save you.

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:55.649
Help me!

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.378
Emmeline!

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:01.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:05.915
It's practically burned through.

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:08.996
Just a couple blows
with the sledgehammer and we're out.

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:35.645
Wait a minute!

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:38.183
I can't cross here!

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:41.921
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.798
All right, look. You're a little boy.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:48.196
If you want to be a big boy,
which way to the main road?

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:56.844
Don't!

01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:58.579
Don't!

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.144
It's no! The answer is no.

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:05.147
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:08.780
There won't be any increase in pensions.
Do you know why?

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.721
Because they got a solid majority...

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:13.055
...of Republicans and Democrats
who've agreed...

01:27:13.194 --> 01:27:17.460
...that if anything is said about pensions,
they'll actually reduce your pension!

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:20.329
Why? Because they know
that you personally...

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:24.201
...were more responsible than anybody else
for closing down the houses.

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:26.933
Could I do anything?
Would he listen to me?

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.377
All right. So you're an honest cop...

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:33.038
...and you've spent a lifetime
being an honest cop...

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:35.843
...and you've got that,
and that's all you've got!

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:38.244
It's no good saying I'm sorry.

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:41.616
I'm too angry and sick at my stomach
to be sorry.

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:46.023
<i>You</i>'<i>re not listening to what I</i>'<i>m saying.</i>
<i>That</i>'<i>s the trouble with this family.</i>

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:49.296
Melville, I smell something burning.

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.495
We're on fire! Come over here.

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:01.798
Come on. This way. Go down. Now. Go.

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:03.337
Hurry up!

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:05.569
Put it out!

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.148
I don't know how! Get something!

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:10.342
-The extinguishers.
-Get one!

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.716
-What'll I do?
-Use it!

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.482
Not on me! On the fire!

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:16.851
It's too deep!

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.457
This is a car, not a canoe!

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.658
Come on! It's easy!

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:23.763
If I don't get out of here...Why? Why?

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:29.960
All right! Here I come!

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.303
It's too deep!

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:37.874
It's too deep, you little rat fink!

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:40.310
Why didn't you tell me it was...
What do I....

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:43.145
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't....

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:45.452
This is no place for a convertible!

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:49.887
I'll get you.

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.432
I'm bleeding, Emmeline!
Look! I'm bleeding!

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:03.536
Mama! What did they do to my Mama?

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:22.448
Benjy!

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:29.929
<i>It</i>'<i>s your father</i>'<i>s fault.</i>

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:32.692

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:34.699
<i>It</i>'<i>s your father</i>'<i>s fault.</i>

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:37.737
What's the matter, Chief?
Something wrong?

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:40.899
<i>-You know as well as I do--</i>
<i>-Listen to me and stop yellingl</i>

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.498
<i>Stop it, Billie.</i>

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.407
<i>Billie, you</i>'<i>re not listening.</i>

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:11.036
Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:14.237
It's only two pieces of small dynamite.

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.982
And they're 70 feet away
in the other room.

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:20.879
This is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.370
Please, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:45.707
-You know I hate explosions.
-It's perfectly all right.

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:49.476
I just want to blow a small hole in the wall,
then we'll be out of here.

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:03.320
Something's happened to the fuse.

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:05.859
-What could possibly--
-Hold it.

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.460
Listen.

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:11.337
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:15.602
-Stay down. Don't get up.
-I just want to take a look, okay?

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:21.945
Now I see.

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:25.577
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.

01:35:25.686 --> 01:35:28.416
The fire extinguisher stuff got on the fuse
and put it out.

01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:30.820
Melville, don't go in there. You'll be killed.

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:34.361
-You'll be blown to bits.
-Monica, for heaven's sake.

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:36.987
I just want to take a look!

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:42.934
Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:45.197
Don't you think I got any sense at all?

01:35:46.107 --> 01:35:48.302
Why can't you have
a little confidence in me?

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:29.612
-I'll never be bad again!
-Whoever said you could fly?

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.844
What do ya want from me?
How long I been flying?

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:34.318
-Keep it going!
-Can't you talk to that radio?

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:37.015
Hello, anybody on the ground!
On the ground, anybody!

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:38.352
Can you hear us?

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:53.606
-Stand back!
-Everybody, stand back.

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:56.501
Stand back, folks. Folks, stand back.

01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:05.749
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
Do you hear me?

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:08.822
-We don't know who they are.
-This is Rancho Conejo Tower.

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:12.950
<i>Aircraft calling Rancho Conejo Tower,</i>
<i>this is Rancho Conejo Tower.</i>

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:14.958
I got 'em!

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:17.690
I got 'em!
Hello, down there on the ground.

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:20.164
This is us in the air. We're in trouble!

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:23.100
An awful jam. Listen. Hello?

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:25.162
I think I lost them.

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:27.740
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>You</i>'<i>re not using the set the right way.</i>

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:31.608
<i>You press your switch in to transmit.</i>
<i>When it</i>'<i>s released, you</i>'<i>re on receive.</i>

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:34.644
<i>Can you understand me?</i>
<i>This is Rancho Conejo Tower.</i>

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:38.876
<i>-Where are you and who are you? Over.</i>
-I know how to work it, Benjy!

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:41.819
I know how to work it.
Hello, down on the ground.

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:43.651
This is us in the air.

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:45.588
We're in this fella's plane.

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:47.621
He knocked himself out...

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:51.391
...because he drank a whole case
of bourbon and hit his head.

01:37:51.599 --> 01:37:52.896
What do we do?

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:55.498
The switch, let go of the switch!

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:58.167
<i>If you can, give us your position.</i>

01:37:58.272 --> 01:38:00.137
<i>Who</i>'<i>s flying the plane? Over.</i>

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:03.241
Whaddya mean, "Who's flying the plane?"

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:05.811
Nobody's flying the plane!

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:08.375
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:11.746
Tell him it's a full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:14.412
Full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:17.012
It's a Twin Beech.
I saw one here this morning.

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:19.888
Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that Col. Wilberforce.

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:23.259
He was at maintenance.
If he's still there, get him over here.

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:26.059
Now listen. Don't talk, just listen.

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:29.066
We're getting things under control,
so you can take it easy.

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:30.864
We know what kind of a plane you're in.

01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:33.405
We're making necessary preparations
to talk you down.

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.872
Rancho Conejo over.

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:38.240
<i>Rancho Conejo tower, listen,</i>
<i>we can</i>'<i>t land this thingl</i>

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:40.176
<i>We</i>'<i>re in real trouble. Overl</i>

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:43.845
You'll be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:47.312
The man at the controls should
also be the man on the radio.

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:51.814
-Here. Put 'em on.
-No. I don't want to!

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.323
Put 'em on!

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:56.089
He said the fella flying
should be on this thing.

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.324
Am I supposed to do everything?
You want me to fly, work the radio?

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.457
What are you? The hostess?

01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:05.332
No, he's got to take charge.
What's the matter with him?

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:07.430
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:11.010
If he catches you at that keyhole,
you'll be rigid-like.

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:14.274
-He didn't want to be disturbed.
-He keeps looking at the wall.

01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:17.111
He'll have to be disturbed
if any of this develops further.

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:21.449
I bet you any amount of money
that we could get on the ball and get....

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:25.624
Everything's under control, Chief.

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:29.662
-You okay, Chief?
-Yes. Why?

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:32.831
-How's it going?
-Something's bound to happen soon.

01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:34.264
Take a look at this.

01:39:34.368 --> 01:39:36.802
Those two in the basement started a fire...

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:39.462
...then set off fireworks.
They still didn't get out.

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.374
<i>Those two guys in the airplane</i>
<i>had an accident...</i>

01:39:42.509 --> 01:39:43.999
<i>...knocked the pilot unconscious.</i>

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:46.909
<i>The control tower</i>
<i>is trying to talk them down.</i>

01:39:48.983 --> 01:39:50.211
<i>The others....</i>

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:53.112
<i>Aerial report that the man,</i>
<i>Otto Meyer, had an accident.</i>

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:55.780
<i>He tried to cross a river and he lost his car.</i>

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:58.585
<i>Now he</i>'<i>s on foot,</i>
<i>walking back to the main road.</i>

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:02.193
<i>This fella Pike, he</i>'<i>s here...</i>

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:05.662
<i>...coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus</i>
<i>and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.</i>

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:10.932
<i>Mr. Finch and this Algernon,</i>
<i>whatever his name is. The limey.</i>

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:13.569
<i>They</i>'<i>re about five or six miles behind...</i>

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:16.165
<i>...in an Avis Chevrolet they rented</i>
<i>in Canyon City.</i>

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:19.105
<i>And this Sylvester Marcus,</i>
<i>the one the old lady called...</i>

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:21.738
<i>...he</i>'<i>s about here going</i>
<i>in the other direction.</i>

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:27.016
They all ought to be meeting up
in about five minutes.

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:44.728
You know what I believe I'd like?

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:51.676
A chocolate fudge sundae
with whipped cream and a cherry on top.

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:11.257
Dingy, don't let this worry you.
We're gonna get killed.

01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:13.993
<i>Men, this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.</i>

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:17.865
<i>These gentlemen here have asked me</i>
<i>to take charge of this situation...</i>

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:22.101
<i>...so I immediately said</i>
<i>that I</i>'<i>d be glad to take charge of it.</i>

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:26.641
<i>-Before I say anything else....</i>
-I don't think he's going to help us, Dingy.

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.806
Yes he is, Benjy. He'll help us.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:32.079
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a colonel. Listen to him.

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:34.083
Steady, men.

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:37.419
I'm told that neither of you
has had flying experience.

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:39.389
Before I say anything else...

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:42.929
...I want to congratulate you
on having done so well...

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:44.790
...so far.

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:49.128
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:52.865
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:58.034
And you can't make your approach
until you've made a long slow turnaround...

01:41:58.145 --> 01:41:59.669
...down to the south.

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:04.908
And we've got to be clear on a few things
before you can start that long slow turn.

01:42:05.619 --> 01:42:10.283
Now, the stick that you're holding,
that is, I assume that....

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:12.389
Men, are you holding that stick?

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:14.460
Is somebody holding that stick? Over!

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:17.689
<i>What stick? The wheel. I</i>'<i>m holding it.</i>

01:42:18.031 --> 01:42:20.192
<i>-We</i>'<i>re both holding it.</i>
-Good.

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:23.667
For a second there, I was afraid...
Never mind that.

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:27.171
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's important that you understand that.

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:30.072
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might....

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:53.499
-You want a lift?
-Yes, thank you very much.

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.727
It's nice of you to stop.

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:58.828
-I'm going as far as Santa Rosita Park.
-That's out of my way.

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:00.372
-We're blocking traffic.
-We are?

01:43:00.507 --> 01:43:02.338
Let's move it. Move it.

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:18.113
There we go. All right.

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.494
You hide behind the counter.
I'll light up a fuse.

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:25.894
Melville, will you just do one thing for me
before you use the dynamite?

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:28.297
Try hitting the door just once more.

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:32.896
Honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door. I mean....

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:37.568
Okay.

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:40.437
Where's the sledgehammer?

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:51.723
This staircase isn't safe anymore.
The fire burned it all out.

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:53.185
Please?

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:56.926
All right.

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:09.839
You're going to....

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:20.876
Melville, for God....

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:22.382
Melville!

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:26.756
Monica...

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:29.495
...now let's forget about the door.

01:44:34.201 --> 01:44:35.190
Look out!

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:37.394
-What?
-They've spotted us.

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:39.597
-Who have?
-Don't stop. Keep going.

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:41.799
-What is this?
-Helicopter. They've seen us.

01:44:41.908 --> 01:44:43.239
What helicopter?

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:49.003
-That's a police helicopter.
-They always use them.

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.947
-Who?
-Who do you think?

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:54.850
I don't want to talk about this,
but they got me hemmed in.

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.889
-Who?
-Will you shut up and listen?

01:44:56.990 --> 01:45:00.892
I'm going to break a rule that says
we must never reveal our true identity.

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:03.861
This is a matter of life or death,
a desperate situation.

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:06.398
-What is?
-Will you shut up and listen?

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:09.434
Look, I haven't got much time,
so if you love your country...

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:12.164
...if you're a patriot, you'll listen,
and listen hard.

01:45:12.272 --> 01:45:14.172
You gotta get to a phone and make a call.

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.299
-I don't got--
-You got to call Intelligence.

01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:18.401
Central Intelligence Agency
in Washington, D.C.

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:20.377
-What on earth--
-Now, listen!

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:24.046
You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:27.678
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today.

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:29.517
They tried to drown me.

01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:31.853
Can you handle a gun? Now, look....

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:34.688
There's a cafe. Pull right in there.
You'll use that phone.

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:37.092
-I don't think l--
-Shut up! You're in no danger.

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:38.925
They've never seen ya. Now, pull in.

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:48.173
All right, good. Get to a phone.

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:51.711
Tell the operator "emergency priority,"
then ask for the CIA.

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:53.837
Jump out. Come on, come on.

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:55.915
You're in no danger. They don't know you.

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:58.814
You're all right.
I'll duck the car and come back.

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:00.887
For God's sake, don't stand in the street.

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:02.614
They'll see you. They'll spot you!

01:46:02.723 --> 01:46:05.021
Move it. Go!

01:46:19.373 --> 01:46:21.102
Sylvester! It's Sylvester!

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.505
Turn around, you idiot!

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:25.305
What do you want to stop him for?
He's going the wrong way.

01:46:25.412 --> 01:46:28.006
It's my son. Do as you're told, stupid.

01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:45.720
They're nuts.

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:49.165
Tell them the tow truck turned around
and is following the Dodge.

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:51.998
<i>2-1-7-1, 2-1-5-9.</i>

01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:54.701
This is stupid.

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:56.732
You call me a stupid idiot.

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:59.141
Let me tell you something.
You're a stupid idiot.

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:03.239
-He'll go all the way to Plaster City.
-So he goes to Plaster City.

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:06.046
I don't know about you,
but I'm turning this thing around.

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:09.316
Now, you want to catch him,
you get out and run.

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:31.037
Let's stop arguing. Please.

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:33.976
The reason we're together
is because they only had one car.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.571
Let's get there, even if we are last.

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:41.419
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget that you hit me...

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:43.512
...when I wasn't even looking.

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:44.791
Yeah.

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:55.091
Russell!

01:48:08.415 --> 01:48:12.408
-How can you be so slow?
-I've had just about enough out of you.

01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:14.350
If ya turned quicker we coulda caught him!

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:17.480
-Why don't you shut up?
-Russell! There!

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:19.582
It's Russell and Mr. Hawthorne!

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:20.921
Stop them! Catch them!

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:22.460
We gonna start that again?

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:25.122
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, you big dope!

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:26.960
What do you want them for anyway?

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.159
Keep up with them. You're falling behind.

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:31.829
Sylvester! Mother! Sylvester!

01:48:31.938 --> 01:48:35.635
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

01:48:40.013 --> 01:48:42.573
I say, what's that chap
honking his hooter for?

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:45.549
It's probably some road hog
who thinks he owns....

01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:47.084
-What?
-What?

01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:50.156
I got to ask you something about Mama!
Russell, wait a minute!

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:52.924
-It's my brother-in-law.
-What's he doing?

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.751
Be careful of him. He's not normal.

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:59.457
You're getting me--
Boy, are you bugging me, man!

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:03.558
I'm going to nail...l'm getting bugged now!

01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:04.670
Whoa, man.

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:10.669
Russell, if you don't pull over, I'll kill you!
I'm warning you, pull over and stop.

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:12.176
I said stop!

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:13.837
You asked for it.

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:24.315
Russell, when I get my hands on you....

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:26.082
What are you doing?

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:28.122
-I said stop!
-Are you crazy?

01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:30.196
-We'll get killed!
-Pull over!

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:44.041
Don't you know what I mean?
I said stop that car!

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:52.747
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!

01:50:12.038 --> 01:50:13.505
Are you crazy?

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:24.712
I've never seen anything like this bunch.

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:27.579
He ran right into them,
ran them right off the road.

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:32.519
-You guys, come on out of there!
-Fellow's absolutely beside himself.

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:35.127
-What are you trying to do?
-Let's go!

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:37.695
-What did you do to my mother?
-We wouldn't do any--

01:50:38.765 --> 01:50:39.925
Move! Move!

01:50:40.033 --> 01:50:43.434
-What did you do to my mother?
-I didn't do anything! Let me explain.

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:45.000
Look here.

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:47.430
She called me. She phoned me.

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.270
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts!

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:52.504
-It was true, wasn't it?
-It's not true.

01:50:52.612 --> 01:50:54.876
Whoever told you was a liar. It's not true.

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:57.711
-It is true!
-Now, look here!

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:01.380
Are you English? Just answer me!

01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:05.116
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Don't you like the English?

01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:09.626
There was an Englishman.

01:51:09.729 --> 01:51:12.721
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you!

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.964
What did you do to my Mama?

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:18.968
-Emmeline!
-Mama!

01:51:19.072 --> 01:51:22.007
Why couldn't you listen?
Why couldn't you shut up...

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:24.235
...when I was trying to tell you to listen?

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:26.707
That chap's run absolutely amok!

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.939
Few minutes, we'll have 'em in position.

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:32.883
In a couple of minutes,
we'll have you in position.

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:35.420
-You're doing a great job, Colonel.
-Thank you.

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:37.683
Why not just shoot 'em down?

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:40.688
None of these people must suspect...

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:44.125
...that they have ever been
under observation.

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:47.627
Now, none of them have ever seen me.

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:49.368
None of them know me...

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:52.230
...so I'll be moving in alone.

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:56.542
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:58.611
And when you pass the word...

01:51:59.846 --> 01:52:03.338
...I don't want to have another policeman
within miles of me.

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:04.815
-Right?
-Right.

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:12.381
I won't like it if I see another policeman.

01:52:14.427 --> 01:52:15.519
I give you my word.

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:19.155
I wanted to stop for you.
My wife and he wanted to stop for you.

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:21.665
Tell him how my mother-in-law
made us drive by him.

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:24.134
Anything you have to say
about your mother-in-law...

01:52:24.237 --> 01:52:25.704
...you don't have to explain to me.

01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:26.965
You know what I mean?

01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:30.099
If she were a star
of a real crummy horror movie...

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:31.575
...l'd believe it.

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:34.580
Yeah!

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:35.670
That's him!

01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:39.081
If I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:40.880
You dirty robber!

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:42.819
Someone you know?

01:52:58.738 --> 01:53:00.603
I'll drive. All set?

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:02.004
All set, Chief.

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:04.032
Culpeper, all set?

01:53:04.377 --> 01:53:08.177
<i>Yes, sir. Airport just reported</i>
<i>and they</i>'<i>re starting an approach now.</i>

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:09.406
Right.

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:20.417
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten something?

01:53:22.328 --> 01:53:24.592
No. I don't think I've forgotten a thing.

01:53:36.509 --> 01:53:40.878
Now, men, about the brakes...
You've got to know about the brakes.

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:44.074
I'll tell you in just a minute.
Just hold it a second.

01:53:45.285 --> 01:53:47.446
What the hell is with this wire?

01:53:47.687 --> 01:53:49.484
Just hold it a second.

01:53:49.889 --> 01:53:51.356
What was that?

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:52.424
Men, look.

01:53:52.892 --> 01:53:57.090
<i>Be calm. This is it.</i>
<i>Just one minute more, it</i>'<i>ll be all over.</i>

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.721
<i>I mean, it</i>'<i>ll all be over.</i>
<i>I mean, courage, men.</i>

01:53:59.866 --> 01:54:02.960
<i>We</i>'<i>re all with you every second.</i>

01:54:03.102 --> 01:54:05.832
<i>We</i>'<i>re pulling for you as hard as we can.</i>

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:10.706
<i>Now it</i>'<i>s just hold onto your nerves, men,</i>
<i>and not get excited or do anything foolish.</i>

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:13.108
<i>But just keep calm. That</i>'<i>s all we</i>'<i>ll do.</i>

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:15.476
<i>Keep calm. Calm, menl</i>

01:54:19.319 --> 01:54:21.150
Not that calm, you idiot!

01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:27.589
Pull up!

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.437
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.

01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:46.378
What's this? What's this that's coming?

01:54:46.679 --> 01:54:50.740
-That's good. That's cement.
-What? Wait a minute! Hold it!

01:54:51.384 --> 01:54:53.375
What are you doing, Benjy?

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:01.451
-What, are you trying to scare me?
-No!

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:03.027
Well, you did.

01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:08.661
It's just a couple of sticks of dynamite,
that's all.

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:12.234
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.

01:55:12.605 --> 01:55:14.368
Get it over right! Get it over!

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:15.632
Left rudder!

01:55:15.942 --> 01:55:17.739
Too low! Pull up.

01:55:17.844 --> 01:55:19.368
No! Left rudder!

01:55:19.479 --> 01:55:22.607
No! Pull it up!

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:23.873
Help!

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.551
Help! I'm the Colonel, you know!

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:30.780
Help!

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:32.619
Help! Get me down!

01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:38.427
We're not going to land
and we'll never make it.

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:42.092
What do you mean, we'll never make it?
Don't freeze.

01:55:42.268 --> 01:55:44.133
Benjy, don't freeze.

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:49.798
This one's going to work.

01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:52.137
-Damn it, come to!
-You hit me.

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:54.713
Listen, wait a minute.

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:02.752
We're down!

01:56:03.156 --> 01:56:04.953
-We're on the ground.
-Hooray!

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:08.089
It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.

01:56:12.966 --> 01:56:13.990
Put on the brakes.

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:15.464
Okay. Where are they?

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:17.669
Benjy! Here comes a restaurant!

01:56:25.545 --> 01:56:26.876
We've landed! Come on.

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:35.810
Come on. Hurry. Now, hurry up.

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:38.148
-Come on, let's go.
-What about him?

01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:40.350
Never mind him. An ambulance will come.

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:42.223
Let's get out of here.

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.064
Cab!

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.224
Cab!

01:56:49.802 --> 01:56:52.737
We're in an awful hurry.
Do you know where the State Park is?

01:56:52.872 --> 01:56:54.863
Sure. What happened?

01:56:54.974 --> 01:56:56.737
Emergency landing. Come on, hurry.

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:58.640
Quick, let's go. Come on.

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:00.178
Come on, Benjy.

01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:15.290
Excuse me.

01:57:20.266 --> 01:57:22.131
Excuse us. Here's your bag.

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.102
You see, the lock didn't work.

01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:27.628
Go.

01:57:27.774 --> 01:57:30.971
That's all.
The owners will pay for everything.

01:57:31.277 --> 01:57:33.575
Next door, he'll pay for everything.
It's okay.

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:43.779
You people. You!

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:45.948
Come back here. Come back!

01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:47.754
You vandals!

01:57:48.127 --> 01:57:51.255
The cops in this town
are morons, retarded.

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:53.631
I'm dealing with moronic people.

01:57:53.733 --> 01:57:56.133
'Cause he's in a bad humor, that fat Nazi.

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:57.896
What, I gotta suffer 'cause of him?

01:57:58.004 --> 01:58:00.598
Get away from me. What's the matter?

01:58:00.706 --> 01:58:05.200
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
Gimme two minutes!

01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:06.903
Now, listen, Sy....

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.946
Will you take us
to Santa Rosita State Park?

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:12.777
What's the matter?
What happened to you? Initiation?

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.750
We had an accident. Hurry up!

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:20.324
<i>Benjamin and Bell stopped at a gardener</i>
<i>supply place and bought picks and shovels.</i>

01:58:20.426 --> 01:58:23.020
<i>Hold it, Chief.</i>
<i>Here</i>'<i>s a report on the Crumps.</i>

01:58:23.162 --> 01:58:27.565
<i>Their cab turned onto 101 moving south</i>
<i>toward your present position.</i>

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:31.830
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>The other taxi</i>'<i>s also turning onto 101...</i>

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:35.032
<i>...and they</i>'<i>re moving north.</i>
<i>They</i>'<i>re both coming your way.</i>

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:36.073
Understood.

01:58:36.375 --> 01:58:37.603
Stand by.

01:58:37.877 --> 01:58:40.107
They ought to be here any minute.

01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:05.626
Look.

01:59:05.738 --> 01:59:09.469
It's the two idiots, the little one
and the one with the marbles in his mouth.

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:11.940
-It's that hokey dentist.
-Yeah.

01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:13.807
Pass that cab.

01:59:13.913 --> 01:59:15.642
-What's the rush?
-Whaddaya mean "rush"?

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.909
No rush. We're just in a hurry.

01:59:26.626 --> 01:59:27.957
Culpeper.

01:59:28.394 --> 01:59:29.383
Now.

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:31.793
Give the order to pull away.

01:59:38.237 --> 01:59:40.671
-Come on. Hurry up.
-Shouldn't I wait around?

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:41.762
No. Here's $5.

01:59:41.908 --> 01:59:45.469
-What's with the pick and shovel?
-Mind your own business. Come on.

01:59:51.651 --> 01:59:53.619
-Think anybody is here?
-Didn't see any cars.

01:59:53.719 --> 01:59:55.346
Wait a minute!

01:59:55.922 --> 01:59:58.413
-Let's talk this over.
-I got nothing to talk about.

01:59:58.524 --> 02:00:00.185
Wait a minute.

02:00:00.326 --> 02:00:01.759
Think anybody else has been here?

02:00:01.861 --> 02:00:04.056
-How should I know?
-Wait!

02:00:04.297 --> 02:00:07.095
If you think we're the first ones here,
why not make a deal?

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:08.200
The four of us?

02:00:08.334 --> 02:00:10.734
Nobody knows where to look,
so we'll look together.

02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:15.170
We'll find it before the others.
Incidentally, where are all the others?

02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:18.772
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.

02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:22.538
What happened to you?

02:00:23.282 --> 02:00:25.910
They're up to something funny, you hear?

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:29.986
Did you see the blonde I brought,
covered in paint with her dress ripped?

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:31.749
What's that all about?

02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:34.985
Yeah. And what about
the picks and shovels?

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:47.796
You run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:51.809
-Let me come, Chief.
-I'd like to, but it might snarl things up.

02:00:52.878 --> 02:00:54.641
Thanks for everything.

02:00:54.947 --> 02:00:56.710
Lots of luck, Chief.

02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:34.476
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?

02:01:34.587 --> 02:01:37.522
No, but there must be
something somewhere.

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:42.888
-See anything?
-Not a thing.

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:46.226
Are you sure he didn't say
something you've forgotten?

02:01:46.365 --> 02:01:50.028
He said it's buried under a big W
and that we'd see it.

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:52.500
-It's gotta be here.
-I tell you what we do.

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:54.903
You go how we came.
We'll go how you came.

02:01:55.007 --> 02:01:57.339
We might have missed something. Hold it.

02:01:58.477 --> 02:02:00.274
You go the way we came....

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:02.413
That's right. Okay, let's go.

02:02:10.089 --> 02:02:12.614
They're looking for something
buried under a big W.

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:15.523
I heard one of them, the stutterer, say it.

02:02:15.628 --> 02:02:17.493
Yeah, I heard. But what?

02:03:07.747 --> 02:03:09.078
Did you see anything?

02:03:09.181 --> 02:03:10.546
-No. Did you?
-Nothing.

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:13.277
That guy hid it so good,
he couldn't find it himself.

02:03:13.386 --> 02:03:14.353
I think--

02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:25.791
Who's he?

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:28.627
-I don't know.
-But he had a shovel.

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.234
Maybe he's a prospector.

02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:32.564
-What are you talking--
-We're wasting time.

02:03:32.671 --> 02:03:34.468
Harder. We gotta look harder!

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.837
Let's look harder. Come on, let's go.

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:52.387
-Who's he?
-I don't know, but he hasn't got a shovel.

02:04:00.633 --> 02:04:03.033
-He's here, I tell ya.
-Yes, sir. That's his car.

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:06.070
-I'll get that phony.
-Somebody must've come in those cabs.

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:09.699
-Come on, let's get moving!
-Come on, let's get moving!

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:12.744
-They must be here.
-They'd better be. Come on, Emmeline.

02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:15.574
-Don't just sit there!
-Don't just sit there!

02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:16.875
Yes, I am.

02:04:17.650 --> 02:04:19.277
Then sit!

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:22.683
Mrs. Finch,
aren't you the teeniest bit curious?

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:26.815
No. I'm not even curious, just disgusted.

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:30.621
I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.

02:04:40.473 --> 02:04:42.839
You wouldn't know a big W if you saw one!

02:04:42.975 --> 02:04:44.374
-I know a--
-Shut up!

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:47.408
I don't care what you say,
I don't think they're here yet.

02:04:47.513 --> 02:04:50.141
They're here somewhere.
That means they haven't found it.

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:54.913
-That's all he said? "Under a big W"?
-Actually, I joined the party after that.

02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:57.454
Yes, sir, that's what he said.
It's under a big W.

02:04:57.556 --> 02:05:00.719
-Let's look--
-Will you shut up and follow me?

02:05:55.314 --> 02:05:56.679
-Who's that?
-I don't know!

02:05:56.782 --> 02:05:58.545
-From this morning?
-Yes.

02:06:01.186 --> 02:06:03.313
-Who's he?
-I don't know.

02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:06.517
-Who's he?
-I don't know!

02:06:06.625 --> 02:06:09.560
Mama, how many people
are mixed up in this?

02:06:10.763 --> 02:06:13.459
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?

02:06:13.599 --> 02:06:15.533
Mama, this thing's like a convention.

02:06:52.671 --> 02:06:55.401
Is anything wrong, ma'am?
I didn't mean to startle you.

02:06:55.507 --> 02:06:59.273
Who are you? Are you with the others,
the ones that are looking?

02:06:59.378 --> 02:07:01.778
-I am, in a way. Aren't you?
-No.

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:05.008
I mean, I didn't want anything
to do with it right from the start.

02:07:05.117 --> 02:07:06.584
And you know what?

02:07:07.186 --> 02:07:11.714
I know where it is.
I'm the only one, and I wasn't even looking.

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:13.189
You know where it is?

02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:15.283
Yes! What should I do?

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:21.164
Come on out, everyone! This is ridiculous.

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:23.666
-I absolutely agree.
-Come on out.

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:26.260
We all know we're all here.
Nobody's fooling anyone.

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:27.964
So we all know. So what?

02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:30.303
Don't talk to my mama
in that tone of voice!

02:07:30.409 --> 02:07:31.774
-You hear?
-Shut up!

02:07:31.877 --> 02:07:35.836
Listen, we ain't the only ones here.
I seen four or five others.

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:37.438
Those two cab drivers.

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:40.575
-They came with us and that dentist.
-You want to start?

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:43.984
-Yes, I want to--
-Why are we wasting time?

02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:45.522
We're all here.

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:49.185
Even if somebody finds the money,
nobody gets away with it...

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:51.353
...unless everybody gets a share.

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:54.465
Let's all get sensible
and get this organized.

02:07:54.566 --> 02:07:56.796
Did you all hear what Mama said?

02:07:57.469 --> 02:07:59.994
-Come on, Mama.
-Now, wait a minute.

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:03.268
Did any of you see a guy with glasses...

02:08:03.375 --> 02:08:06.037
...with a sneery expression on his face?

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:09.306
This guy was ugly. I mean, like, real ugly.

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:17.820
If you help dig it up,
you can have half and I'll have half.

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:20.683
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:23.484
If I have half of the money...

02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:27.090
...I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:32.364
Not Russell or my mother
or Sylvester, anybody.

02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:35.600
You don't know what that'd mean.

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:37.206
If I had enough money...

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:40.437
...I might be able to live
in a convent or something.

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:41.813
In a convent?

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:45.642
We all know we're all here.

02:08:45.784 --> 02:08:48.776
It seems intelligent to me
that we should all share...

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:51.082
...in one equal share apiece, right?

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:52.282
Right. Mel was right.

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:53.915
We all know that. Lookit--

02:08:55.728 --> 02:08:57.753
-No.
-Yeah.

02:08:57.896 --> 02:09:00.057
It's him, all right. Yeah!

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:04.228
You got this wrong. I came to apologize.

02:09:04.369 --> 02:09:07.202
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend.

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:11.302
-He's so neurotic. Can't you do something?
-I'll get you.

02:09:11.777 --> 02:09:16.180
-He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
-When I get my hands on you....

02:09:27.793 --> 02:09:29.124
Why, that's it.

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:31.385
Sure. Look!

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:33.465
It's the big W, I tell you!

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:35.458
It's the big W!

02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:39.070
Look at this.

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:40.535
Look at it!

02:09:46.478 --> 02:09:48.173
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.

02:09:49.648 --> 02:09:51.582
I'm afraid it's too late.

02:09:51.984 --> 02:09:53.918
I think they've found it.

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.521
Right here all the time! He wasn't kidding!

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:02.617
-He was telling the truth!
-Folks, isn't this great?

02:10:03.428 --> 02:10:06.226
Congratulations. Well done.

02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:09.992
Listen, I think the big boy
should get an extra share.

02:10:10.135 --> 02:10:12.262
After all, it was he who found it.

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:15.670
Yes! I insist he gets an extra share.

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:17.901
That's right. He deserves an extra share.

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:20.872
Let's start digging.

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:23.209
Suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:26.148
We're here with
an anthropological expedition.

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:28.014
-Nah.
-We don't tell them anything!

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.520
We tell them to scram
or we beat their brains in.

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:33.221
It was a nice dream.

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:36.427
Lasted almost five minutes.

02:10:46.471 --> 02:10:48.268
Now, don't bug me, I said.

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:50.401
Faster.

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:52.267
Come on, dig, dig.

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:54.336
Faster, faster.

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.471
Faster. Dig. That's it, dig.

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:53.670
Faster.

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:10.449
There's not enough room. You two, out.

02:12:10.555 --> 02:12:12.113
Let us do it.

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:21.898
Wait. There's not enough room.
You're bugging me.

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:24.294
-"Bugging"?
-Cut out, cut out.

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:25.801
What's this "cut out" talk?

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:28.202
-Out, baby. Out!
-Don't call me baby.

02:12:28.307 --> 02:12:31.333
-Quit arguing!
-Will ya come on?

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:45.082
-What's that?
-What was that?

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:48.259
-That's it.
-Sounded like a chest.

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.021
I wonder what's in it.

02:12:50.762 --> 02:12:52.195
Bring it up here!

02:12:59.404 --> 02:13:00.803
There it is!

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.403
-It's a satchel.
-Hold it up!

02:13:04.977 --> 02:13:08.140
-It's a satchel!
-I got it.

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:10.374
Open it up.

02:13:10.615 --> 02:13:11.946
Come on!

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.044
Bingo!

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:20.016
I say, chaps,
shouldn't we find a spot of cover?

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:21.353
There's nobody around.

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:23.018
Come on. Count it out.

02:13:23.128 --> 02:13:25.494
-What are we waiting for?
-Now wait a second!

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:29.862
Everybody's going to get something,
so no arguments. We all get equal shares!

02:13:30.235 --> 02:13:31.224
He's right.

02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:34.305
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody.

02:13:34.439 --> 02:13:36.236
Now, how many are we?

02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:38.471
One, two...

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:42.937
...three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

02:13:43.949 --> 02:13:48.682
...9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:50.720
...14, 15.

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:53.885
15 of us. That means 15 equal shares.

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:57.553
You dirty double-crosser.
You cut yourself in for twice!

02:13:57.763 --> 02:13:59.663
You can't get away with that!

02:14:00.098 --> 02:14:01.065
Get him!

02:14:01.366 --> 02:14:02.355
Grab him!

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:04.132
Get him!

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:09.571
You only cheated yourself
because now you're out.

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:13.643
Listen!
You can't cut me out now, you hear?

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:15.474
Not after what I've been through!

02:14:16.448 --> 02:14:18.006
All right. Okay.

02:14:18.116 --> 02:14:22.246
I'm warning you, if I don't get a share,
I'm going straight to the police.

02:14:22.421 --> 02:14:25.652
-The police?
-What makes you think the police--

02:14:26.391 --> 02:14:28.621
That money had to come from somewhere.

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:33.187
We know where it's from,
that poor man that died on the mountain.

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:35.697
You wasn't even there, so shut up.

02:14:35.934 --> 02:14:39.335
Okay, you asked for it.
I'm going straight to the police.

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:41.996
You think they'd be interested, Mr. Meyer?

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:44.608
Are you kidding? Isn't it obvious?

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:46.301
How do you think money gets....

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:51.114
How did you know my name?

02:14:51.316 --> 02:14:52.681
You know this crook?

02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:57.788
I've never met him, Mr. Pike,
but I've come to feel that I know him.

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:01.817
How did you know my name?
I've never met you.

02:15:02.327 --> 02:15:04.352
Yeah, who are you?

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:06.455
Didn't he come with you?

02:15:06.898 --> 02:15:09.662
He didn't come with us.
We thought he came with you.

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:10.933
No.

02:15:11.103 --> 02:15:15.540
If he didn't come with us,
then who are you?

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:17.835
I'm Capt. Culpeper...

02:15:18.443 --> 02:15:20.536
...of the Santa Rosita Police Department.

02:15:25.817 --> 02:15:28.581
<i>-Will you come to the point?</i>
-Yeah, I'm coming to it.

02:15:28.753 --> 02:15:32.450
Point is, I have enough stuff
in my private files...

02:15:32.657 --> 02:15:35.023
...stuff relating to civic building...

02:15:35.127 --> 02:15:38.494
...road contracts,
harbor and cannery projects...

02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:41.394
...enough stuff to put you,
the D.A., myself...

02:15:41.533 --> 02:15:45.697
...and a two-thirds majority behind bars
for the next 20 years.

02:15:45.837 --> 02:15:49.796
And I give you my word,
that's exactly where everybody's going...

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:54.344
-...unless things start happening now.
<i>-Like what, for instance?</i>

02:15:54.513 --> 02:15:57.482
I want the pension
for Culpeper's grade trebled.

02:15:57.749 --> 02:16:01.981
Not doubled, trebled.
I want Culpeper to retire with honor.

02:16:02.154 --> 02:16:06.284
I want it on paper that
that's exactly what's going to happen.

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:09.121
And I want it in my hands in 15 minutes...

02:16:09.394 --> 02:16:12.329
...or I'll have all the reporters in town
in here in 20.

02:16:13.098 --> 02:16:17.330
You know the word for this, Your Honor.
It's called blackmail.

02:16:35.754 --> 02:16:39.416
Sir, could you possibly see your way clear
to give us a break?

02:16:39.523 --> 02:16:41.754
You kidding? Him give you a break?

02:16:42.427 --> 02:16:44.621
We had a pretty rough day already.

02:16:44.728 --> 02:16:48.324
We was all covered with dirt,
and we fell down in an airplane...

02:16:48.466 --> 02:16:51.026
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

02:16:51.636 --> 02:16:53.900
I know we don't deserve
any kindness, Captain.

02:16:54.004 --> 02:16:58.031
But if you could help us,
I'm sure we'd all be inspired...

02:16:58.143 --> 02:16:59.610
...to live better lives.

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:02.011
There is one thing.

02:17:03.013 --> 02:17:05.209
I don't know whether it would help or not.

02:17:05.517 --> 02:17:09.044
But if, instead of my turning you in...

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:12.251
...you went and turned yourselves in...

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:16.455
...juries sometimes look very favorably
on things like that.

02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:18.959
You'd let us do that?

02:17:19.197 --> 02:17:21.630
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.

02:17:21.933 --> 02:17:23.559
You must be a fine human being.

02:17:23.701 --> 02:17:26.500
After all, why should you worry
whether we get a break?

02:17:26.605 --> 02:17:29.733
Mr. Meyer,
no matter what you've all done today...

02:17:29.841 --> 02:17:31.741
...you're not really criminals.

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:36.179
So if you like,
you can all hop into those two cabs...

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:39.079
...and drive over to Santa Rosita...

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:42.316
...and just walk in.

02:17:42.821 --> 02:17:46.415
-Then let's do that.
-But, sir, we can't all fit.

02:17:46.523 --> 02:17:50.893
You can't take the stolen vehicles.
Those have to stay to be picked up later.

02:17:51.029 --> 02:17:53.656
-What are we waiting for?
-Let's go.

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:57.325
Back in the back.

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:01.629
Drive carefully.

02:18:01.772 --> 02:18:04.367
They may be the last passengers
you'll ever carry.

02:18:04.476 --> 02:18:06.034
Funny. That's funny.

02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:07.406
Funny, right? Funny?

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:10.072
You could be the most
comical cop I ever met.

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:11.606
Yeah.

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:41.407
-Culpeper.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

02:18:42.047 --> 02:18:44.072
Everything is under control here.

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:47.712
It'll take a little longer
because there was a joker in the deck...

02:18:47.818 --> 02:18:50.117
...that nobody knew about. All right?

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:51.583
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:55.082
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

02:18:55.427 --> 02:18:56.415
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

02:19:03.701 --> 02:19:07.331
Listen, why does the man
want to give everybody a break?

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:10.431
-What's his angle there?
-I was wondering about that, too.

02:19:10.575 --> 02:19:14.204
Something funny's going on.
How's he know what we're going to do?

02:19:14.346 --> 02:19:16.870
We're in enough of a mess.
We better do what he said.

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:19.347
I'm tellin' you,
the man has got some angle.

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:21.178
Wait, wait. Hold it!

02:19:21.286 --> 02:19:22.378
Can you see him?

02:19:32.664 --> 02:19:36.361
-Just what does he think he's doing?
-That certainly is strange.

02:19:36.468 --> 02:19:38.459
-Sure is.
-What is he doing?

02:19:38.736 --> 02:19:41.672
-He's going the other way.
-Why are we standing here?

02:19:42.107 --> 02:19:43.130
That's it!

02:19:45.175 --> 02:19:47.370
We're off the hook!

02:19:48.012 --> 02:19:50.572
Get out of here! Come on, we're off!

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:52.509
Come on, get going.

02:20:05.997 --> 02:20:07.897
Holy mackerel. Almost didn't make it.

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:25.680
No other cops around. He planned it.

02:20:25.784 --> 02:20:29.720
We found the money and he was waiting
to take it away from us.

02:20:29.821 --> 02:20:33.814
But if we all find the money first
and turn it in, we're all in the clear.

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:37.387
Let's just get the dough
and worry about the rest later.

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:40.587
-Look. He's slowing down.
-No, he's turning to the left.

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:34.913
What's going on?

02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:36.853
Sorry, Jimmy.

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:30.702
He's heading for the border!

02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:32.867
We should stop and call the police station!

02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:34.035
You shut up!

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:36.804
We're going to get that money.
Keep driving!

02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:39.273
That woman is something else.

02:22:40.118 --> 02:22:41.642
Take your foot off the brake!

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:43.311
Stop hitting me. I'm driving.

02:22:43.421 --> 02:22:46.720
-When you want a cab, you can't get one.
-Yeah, come on, let's go!

02:22:56.167 --> 02:22:57.725
<i>F-14 to Central.</i>

02:22:57.936 --> 02:22:59.301
Come in. What is it?

02:22:59.437 --> 02:23:01.064
<i>There</i>'<i>s something phony here.</i>

02:23:01.205 --> 02:23:04.140
<i>We</i>'<i>re on 101 by Cortez</i>
<i>checking a mad-dog report.</i>

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:05.971
Orders were to maintain silence.

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:08.543
Capt. Culpeper wants
this channel kept clear.

02:23:08.646 --> 02:23:13.549
<i>We know it, but we saw Capt. Culpeper.</i>
<i>He just went by doing 90 miles an hour.</i>

02:23:14.452 --> 02:23:16.716
I don't think I understand that.

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:19.288
Are you sure it was Capt. Culpeper?

02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:21.415
<i>-Yep.</i>
-Was he chasing anybody?

02:23:21.526 --> 02:23:23.687
<i>-Nope.</i>
-Could he have been chasing anybody?

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:27.322
<i>Not a chance.</i>
<i>That</i>'<i>s what struck us so funny.</i>

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:30.433
<i>There were about 15 people</i>
<i>in two cabs behind him.</i>

02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:32.636
<i>It looked like they were chasing him.</i>

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:35.898
They were chasing him?
What's going on here?

02:23:36.007 --> 02:23:38.237
I brought it myself.
Everything you asked for.

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:39.605
-The pension?
-Yeah.

02:23:39.744 --> 02:23:41.644
Call Capt. Culpeper.

02:23:42.347 --> 02:23:45.373
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Central Division. Urgent.

02:23:45.483 --> 02:23:48.281
Calling Capt. Culpeper.

02:23:57.362 --> 02:24:00.593
-This can only happen in America.
-You going to start that again?

02:24:32.196 --> 02:24:35.188
You've got to believe me.
I'm going to be sick.

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:50.607
What's the matter? You trying to kill us?

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:53.837
Just don't make me nervous!

02:26:28.279 --> 02:26:31.043
-Don't let him get away!
-Cut him off!

02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:40.350
<i>Calling Capt. Culpeper.</i>
<i>Culp, this is Aloysius speaking.</i>

02:26:40.458 --> 02:26:43.985
<i>Now, listen to me, Culp.</i>
<i>Everything has been fixed.</i>

02:26:44.128 --> 02:26:46.824
<i>There</i>'<i>s been negotiations</i>
<i>and everything is all right.</i>

02:26:47.031 --> 02:26:49.522
Cut out this nonsense and answer me.

02:26:49.667 --> 02:26:51.601
This is Aloysius speaking.

02:27:02.013 --> 02:27:05.346
I still don't understand this.
What's it all about?

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:08.652
That's it.

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:12.385
All units...

02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:14.724
...arrest Capt. Culpeper.

02:27:16.494 --> 02:27:18.621
There he is!

02:27:23.901 --> 02:27:26.461
-Come back!
-Get me out of here!

02:27:26.838 --> 02:27:28.999
Just don't sit there. Come on.

02:27:31.576 --> 02:27:32.668
Come on!

02:27:43.988 --> 02:27:45.751
Stop pushing, will ya?

02:27:46.257 --> 02:27:49.624
Wait. We got him.
Now, you women stay here.

02:27:49.727 --> 02:27:51.695
What do you mean,
"You women stay here"?

02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:53.354
You heard him, mother. Stay here!

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:55.055
Come on! Let's go!

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:13.911
-Is he there?
-Where'd he go?

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:15.910
Halt! Halt!

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:17.885
Now, wait a minute. Listen.

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:28.756
Yeah!

02:29:34.799 --> 02:29:37.632
Stop pushing! Get the suitcase.

02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:41.232
Look! Look up there!

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:43.702
...in this regard, and there is no doubt....

02:29:49.981 --> 02:29:51.676
Those ladders are not safe!

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:54.916
Ladders are not safe!

02:30:00.992 --> 02:30:02.186
Get off!

02:30:03.027 --> 02:30:04.756
-You got it?
-Get it away.

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.263
Get moving!

02:30:14.472 --> 02:30:16.633
Don't push. You got it? That's it.

02:30:22.813 --> 02:30:26.214
Sylvester, what are you doing up there?
You must be out of your mind!

02:30:29.887 --> 02:30:32.378
-Wait a minute!
-Get the suitcase!

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:38.828
Get that money!

02:30:59.917 --> 02:31:02.112
Don't you dare touch any of that money.

02:31:14.899 --> 02:31:17.766
-You! Don't stand there!
-To your right!

02:31:29.713 --> 02:31:31.044
Russell, hang on!

02:31:35.419 --> 02:31:37.284
Dingy, I can't hold on!

02:31:39.423 --> 02:31:40.617
Help us!

02:31:44.462 --> 02:31:45.986
Get off my hand!

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.617
Move onto the ladder!

02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:14.049
Hold on! Wait a minute!
One at a time! Did you hear me?

02:32:14.258 --> 02:32:15.452
One at a time!

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:19.991
All right!

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:23.766
All right, you'll see. You'll see.

02:32:25.369 --> 02:32:27.803
Get on alphabetical. I'm Benjy.

02:32:28.405 --> 02:32:31.033
Quit stepping on my head!

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:32.266
Get on the ladder.

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:33.977
Get on the ladder.

02:32:35.246 --> 02:32:37.476
Don't leave me! Come back here!

02:32:37.781 --> 02:32:39.476
You can't leave me!

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:47.856
There's too many men on it to control it.

02:33:17.821 --> 02:33:20.312
Hold it steady. Watch it.
She's whipping loose.

02:33:59.396 --> 02:34:02.058
Wind us down!

02:34:05.803 --> 02:34:08.169
I don't want the money!

02:34:12.009 --> 02:34:13.271
Look out!

02:34:21.352 --> 02:34:23.013
Get off!

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:25.188
She's going! Get out of there!

02:35:48.739 --> 02:35:50.468
It's all your fault.

02:35:51.241 --> 02:35:53.709
It's your fault from beginning to end.

02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:57.203
You know, even for a policeman...

02:35:57.481 --> 02:36:00.348
...your behavior was ruddy outrageous.

02:36:00.684 --> 02:36:03.278
You could've taken a fair share
like the rest of us...

02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:07.513
...but no, you had to grab up
the whole scene, baby.

02:36:07.725 --> 02:36:12.992
We had $350,000 right in our hands.

02:36:13.597 --> 02:36:16.760
Fourteen into $350,000....

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:18.962
Shut up.

02:36:21.672 --> 02:36:24.436
I wish I knew what
they were gonna do to us.

02:36:24.675 --> 02:36:29.669
But no matter what happens to us,
I hope what happens to you will be worse.

02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:34.946
I don't think you have to worry
too much about that.

02:36:35.519 --> 02:36:37.453
My wife is divorcing me.

02:36:38.555 --> 02:36:41.251
My mother-in-law is suing me for damages.

02:36:42.626 --> 02:36:46.153
My daughter is applying to the courts
to have her name changed.

02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:49.094
My pension has been revoked.

02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:53.092
And the only reason that you 10 idiots...

02:36:53.971 --> 02:36:56.462
...will very likely get off lightly...

02:36:57.508 --> 02:37:01.239
...is because the judge will have
me up there to throw the book at.

02:37:02.346 --> 02:37:03.813
That's tough.

02:37:08.118 --> 02:37:12.851
I'd like to think that sometime,
maybe 10 or 20 years from now...

02:37:14.057 --> 02:37:17.220
...there'd be something
I could laugh at, anything.

02:37:27.171 --> 02:37:30.572
Now, see here, you idiots,
it's all your fault because--

02:37:44.555 --> 02:37:46.853
Get away from me!

02:37:47.024 --> 02:37:48.116
Let me go!
