04:54.300 --> 04:56.874
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

05:08.983 --> 05:11.236
Get out of the car.

08:51.099 --> 08:56.070
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

08:56.388 --> 08:58.855
Yeah, they showed me.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.239
Could be unrelated.

09:03.452 --> 09:05.255
Could be.

09:05.818 --> 09:09.009
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

09:09.228 --> 09:11.031
No.

09:11.941 --> 09:15.417
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

09:16.499 --> 09:18.681
That’s what I'm thinking.

09:56.198 --> 09:58.902
Just one more bag after that.

11:44.612 --> 11:46.522
I just wanted to come here.

11:48.092 --> 11:50.037
To Winkie's?

11:50.666 --> 11:52.291
This Winkie's.

11:53.311 --> 11:57.060
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

12:00.965 --> 12:02.908
It’s kind of embarrassing.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.605
Go ahead.

12:09.037 --> 12:12.477
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.492
See what I mean?

12:16.135 --> 12:20.239
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

12:21.736 --> 12:23.646
Tell me.

12:26.991 --> 12:28.686
Well...

12:30.331 --> 12:34.435
it’s the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

12:36.315 --> 12:40.099
They start out that I'm in here but...

12:40.385 --> 12:42.888
it’s not day or night...

12:43.482 --> 12:45.771
it’s kind of half-night, you know?

12:46.162 --> 12:48.902
But it looks just like this.

12:49.119 --> 12:51.135
Except for the light.

12:52.389 --> 12:55.579
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.587
Of all people...

12:59.834 --> 13:02.409
you're standing right over there.

13:06.306 --> 13:08.453
By that counter.

13:10.377 --> 13:13.818
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

13:15.978 --> 13:19.454
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

13:23.424 --> 13:26.056
then I realize what it is.

13:29.722 --> 13:31.976
There's a man...

13:32.713 --> 13:35.003
in back of this place.

13:37.341 --> 13:39.666
He's the one who's doing it.

13:41.377 --> 13:44.224
I can see him through the wall.

13:44.439 --> 13:46.621
I can see his face.

13:52.441 --> 13:57.483
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.733
That’s it.

14:10.116 --> 14:14.114
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

14:17.562 --> 14:20.444
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

14:23.755 --> 14:25.487
Right then.

15:12.570 --> 15:14.372
It’s around the back.

16:23.095 --> 16:26.641
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

16:26.852 --> 16:29.698
What is it, Dan? Dan?

16:55.244 --> 16:56.275
Hello?

16:58.479 --> 17:01.362
The girl is still missing.

17:22.347 --> 17:25.538
- Talk to me.
- The same.

18:03.751 --> 18:05.767
I can't believe it.

18:36.142 --> 18:39.262
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

18:39.935 --> 18:42.817
- It’s been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

18:43.032 --> 18:46.638
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

18:46.997 --> 18:51.269
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

18:51.487 --> 18:53.431
Won't that be the day?

18:53.643 --> 18:55.896
Good luck, Betty dear.

18:56.113 --> 19:00.277
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

19:00.498 --> 19:02.515
Thanks, again.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.713
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

19:05.925 --> 19:07.515
Thank you.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.865
- My bags?
- Where to?

19:21.338 --> 19:23.212
1612, Hayvenhurst.

19:26.036 --> 19:27.566
Got it.

20:45.328 --> 20:49.884
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

20:50.095 --> 20:54.130
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

20:54.932 --> 20:59.203
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

20:59.420 --> 21:02.753
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

21:07.387 --> 21:09.190
Wilkins!

21:09.405 --> 21:10.436
Wilkins!

21:10.657 --> 21:14.133
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

21:14.346 --> 21:19.245
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

21:19.460 --> 21:21.157
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

21:21.374 --> 21:24.327
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

21:24.541 --> 21:29.024
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

21:29.237 --> 21:34.623
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.798
Let’s go see your aunt’s apartment.
It’s a good one.

21:39.013 --> 21:40.959
I can hardly wait.

21:48.338 --> 21:52.372
- It’s unbelievable!
- I told you.

21:53.522 --> 21:57.865
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

21:58.081 --> 22:00.548
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

22:00.758 --> 22:04.235
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

22:04.447 --> 22:06.736
or they wouldn't be here.

22:07.057 --> 22:10.248
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

22:10.467 --> 22:13.064
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

23:38.979 --> 23:42.977
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

23:43.190 --> 23:45.727
- I'm so sorry.
- It’s okay.

23:46.216 --> 23:51.603
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

23:52.271 --> 23:56.233
There was an accident.
I came here.

23:56.446 --> 23:58.985
I understand. I saw the dress.

23:59.542 --> 24:02.010
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

24:02.987 --> 24:04.825
What happened?

24:06.118 --> 24:07.884
A car...

24:08.832 --> 24:10.908
a car accident.

24:13.007 --> 24:14.952
Are you okay?

24:17.390 --> 24:19.299
I think so.

24:19.860 --> 24:21.937
I was just...

24:22.470 --> 24:24.239
taking a shower.

24:24.454 --> 24:28.133
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

24:28.352 --> 24:30.712
I'm gonna get unpacked.

24:34.613 --> 24:36.523
What’s your name?

24:40.494 --> 24:44.171
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

25:21.585 --> 25:23.114
My name is...

25:23.740 --> 25:25.270
Rita.

25:27.847 --> 25:29.923
Do you work with my aunt?

25:30.421 --> 25:34.205
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

25:34.492 --> 25:36.639
it's none of my business.

25:40.337 --> 25:42.282
She has pretty red hair.

25:42.877 --> 25:44.858
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

25:45.069 --> 25:50.147
that's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

25:50.358 --> 25:52.683
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

25:53.350 --> 25:56.826
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

25:57.038 --> 26:00.027
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

26:00.239 --> 26:03.465
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

26:03.682 --> 26:07.051
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

26:10.851 --> 26:14.456
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

26:14.677 --> 26:19.162
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

26:19.932 --> 26:24.096
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.951
Sit down.

26:38.268 --> 26:40.344
Where were you hurt?

26:42.756 --> 26:44.700
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

26:44.913 --> 26:49.539
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.968
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

26:52.186 --> 26:54.545
I'll be okay if I sleep.

26:54.760 --> 26:58.305
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

27:55.682 --> 27:59.537
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

27:59.753 --> 28:01.662
that ought to be brought forward.

28:01.875 --> 28:04.901
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

28:05.110 --> 28:08.206
And that's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

28:09.251 --> 28:13.178
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

28:14.086 --> 28:18.774
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

28:19.967 --> 28:23.752
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

28:34.198 --> 28:36.274
What was it the last time?

28:38.198 --> 28:43.405
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

28:44.148 --> 28:45.701
We'll see.

28:53.508 --> 28:56.911
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

28:58.657 --> 29:00.495
Please...

29:01.058 --> 29:04.284
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

29:04.502 --> 29:07.763
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

29:07.981 --> 29:11.588
And his manager,
Robert Smith.

29:46.149 --> 29:48.261
She's very pretty.

29:49.663 --> 29:53.032
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

29:55.299 --> 29:57.933
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

29:58.187 --> 30:01.486
- What's the photo for?
- One espresso.

30:03.128 --> 30:05.204
No, that's it.

30:05.424 --> 30:07.713
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

30:08.103 --> 30:10.179
I've done quite a bit of research...

30:10.399 --> 30:11.929
knowing how hard
you are to please.

30:12.139 --> 30:14.157
This one comes
highly recommended.

30:14.436 --> 30:18.540
- What's the photo for?
- It's a recommendation.

30:19.550 --> 30:22.361
A recommendation to you, Adam.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.984
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

30:27.693 --> 30:31.583
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

30:32.110 --> 30:36.108
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

30:36.321 --> 30:40.734
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

30:41.609 --> 30:46.092
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

30:46.967 --> 30:48.592
This is the girl.

30:49.193 --> 30:51.969
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

30:52.186 --> 30:53.466
Hold on?

30:53.683 --> 30:56.256
There's no way!
There's no way!

31:11.357 --> 31:13.302
Napkin.

31:14.314 --> 31:15.939
Pardon?

31:16.158 --> 31:17.651
Napkin.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.086
Of course.

31:20.611 --> 31:22.165
Excuse me.

31:39.121 --> 31:40.924
Is that all, sir?

32:38.339 --> 32:41.673
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

32:41.888 --> 32:44.485
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

32:44.706 --> 32:48.217
What's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

32:52.500 --> 32:56.913
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

32:59.875 --> 33:02.163
It's no longer your film.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.228
This is the girl.

33:48.341 --> 33:51.260
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

33:51.925 --> 33:53.729
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

33:53.944 --> 33:56.790
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

34:06.992 --> 34:08.724
Castigliani brothers?

34:08.938 --> 34:10.706
Beat it, pal.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.259
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.824
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

35:03.877 --> 35:06.238
The director doesn't want her.

35:09.827 --> 35:12.401
Do you want him replaced?

35:15.254 --> 35:17.164
I know they said...

35:19.430 --> 35:21.090
Then?

35:21.796 --> 35:23.326
Then...

35:24.302 --> 35:26.733
that means we should...?

35:29.833 --> 35:31.363
Yes?

35:33.035 --> 35:36.783
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

35:39.192 --> 35:43.082
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

35:48.481 --> 35:51.507
Then we'll shut everything down.

36:20.771 --> 36:24.484
Oh, man, that's unheard of.

36:24.702 --> 36:27.892
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

36:30.616 --> 36:33.462
- It's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

36:34.756 --> 36:36.869
Unbelievable, man.

36:43.351 --> 36:45.889
So, bro? God, you look good.

36:46.447 --> 36:49.436
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

36:49.649 --> 36:51.309
doing some stuff
for this guy.

36:52.676 --> 36:54.442
Are you making ends meet?

36:54.659 --> 36:56.319
Hardly.

36:58.173 --> 37:01.648
I know, man, look at my digs.

37:03.287 --> 37:05.506
Times are tough, bro.

37:06.487 --> 37:09.749
Hey... man, it's not that bad.

37:10.906 --> 37:13.504
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

37:13.725 --> 37:16.714
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

37:16.960 --> 37:21.267
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

37:24.024 --> 37:26.728
Hey, so that's... that's it, huh?

37:26.946 --> 37:29.378
That's Ed's famous black book.

37:32.478 --> 37:34.980
The history of the world...

37:35.470 --> 37:37.273
in phone numbers.

38:07.026 --> 38:08.829
Oh, man!

38:21.535 --> 38:24.241
Something bit me bad!

39:14.143 --> 39:15.459
Hey, man!

39:15.674 --> 39:19.280
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

39:20.301 --> 39:23.849
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

39:25.172 --> 39:29.691
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

39:50.327 --> 39:51.715
Hey, man.

40:33.297 --> 40:34.993
Oh, man!

40:51.319 --> 40:56.849
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

40:57.059 --> 40:59.243
inside out.

40:59.462 --> 41:02.581
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

41:02.801 --> 41:04.604
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

41:04.819 --> 41:07.001
like a regular movie star.

41:07.498 --> 41:10.072
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

41:10.281 --> 41:13.306
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

41:13.587 --> 41:15.390
Rita!

41:15.917 --> 41:17.615
What do you mean?

41:18.632 --> 41:20.744
She was in an accident.

41:21.972 --> 41:24.606
Rita. Your friend.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.790
No, Coco unlocked the door.

41:30.218 --> 41:32.472
No, she didn't see her.

41:33.453 --> 41:35.565
She's sleeping.

41:36.550 --> 41:40.713
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

41:43.197 --> 41:47.395
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

42:00.975 --> 42:02.778
You're awake.

42:06.646 --> 42:08.449
I think I misunderstood.

42:08.838 --> 42:12.099
I thought you knew my aunt
and that's why you were here.

42:12.631 --> 42:15.750
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

42:22.476 --> 42:24.173
Rita?

42:27.590 --> 42:29.844
I'm sorry, I...

42:30.340 --> 42:32.355
What is it, Rita?

42:35.803 --> 42:40.595
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

42:41.439 --> 42:43.491
What's wrong?

42:45.405 --> 42:47.766
I just don't know who I am.

42:48.328 --> 42:51.482
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

42:52.432 --> 42:54.900
I don't know what my name is.

42:55.112 --> 42:57.366
I don't know who I am.

43:07.776 --> 43:11.596
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

43:13.621 --> 43:15.805
You wanna know, don't you?

43:16.928 --> 43:19.110
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

44:54.174 --> 44:57.364
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

44:57.583 --> 44:59.421
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

44:59.637 --> 45:01.925
No. Thanks, though.

45:02.628 --> 45:05.510
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

45:08.404 --> 45:10.977
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

45:15.814 --> 45:18.625
Any new girls on the street lately?

45:20.443 --> 45:21.795
No.

45:22.390 --> 45:24.679
I haven't seen any.

45:26.044 --> 45:28.120
A brunette?

45:28.340 --> 45:30.973
Maybe a little beat-up?

45:31.193 --> 45:32.688
No.

45:36.725 --> 45:40.309
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

45:41.353 --> 45:42.633
You bet you will.

45:45.667 --> 45:47.778
That money...

45:49.806 --> 45:52.724
you don't know where it came from?

45:55.236 --> 45:59.577
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

46:01.568 --> 46:04.556
does it make you
remember anything?

46:06.577 --> 46:09.424
There's something...

46:10.336 --> 46:12.660
something...

46:12.876 --> 46:15.651
there.

46:25.748 --> 46:27.278
What did you say?

46:27.488 --> 46:31.071
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

46:31.665 --> 46:35.732
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

46:36.152 --> 46:41.229
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

46:42.484 --> 46:44.073
No.

46:44.293 --> 46:46.867
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

46:47.076 --> 46:48.666
I'm going home.

46:48.886 --> 46:50.166
Home?

46:50.382 --> 46:54.023
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

46:54.244 --> 46:58.479
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

46:58.697 --> 47:01.651
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

47:01.864 --> 47:03.808
I'm going home.

47:14.007 --> 47:16.676
I wonder where you were going.

47:21.069 --> 47:23.121
Mulholland Drive.

47:28.201 --> 47:30.003
Mulholland Drive?

47:32.308 --> 47:34.419
That's where I was going.

47:35.125 --> 47:37.556
Mulholland Drive.

47:38.778 --> 47:41.970
Maybe that's where
the accident was.

47:42.676 --> 47:45.866
There must be a police report.
We could call.

47:46.572 --> 47:50.642
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

47:51.618 --> 47:57.002
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

47:58.610 --> 48:00.591
I wanna walk around, anyway.

48:00.803 --> 48:03.543
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

48:04.038 --> 48:06.956
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

48:14.546 --> 48:16.171
Okay.

48:16.390 --> 48:18.678
But just...

48:20.565 --> 48:22.925
just to see.

48:23.139 --> 48:26.995
Just to see if there was
an accident...

48:27.385 --> 48:30.017
on Mulholland Drive.

49:12.476 --> 49:14.279
Lorraine?

49:15.573 --> 49:17.755
You're home?

49:20.687 --> 49:22.669
Lorraine?

49:42.746 --> 49:44.655
Now you've done it!

49:47.025 --> 49:50.323
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

49:53.601 --> 49:56.140
What the hell are you
even doing here?

50:08.179 --> 50:10.539
What are you doing?

50:13.851 --> 50:16.140
That's my jewelry!

50:32.917 --> 50:37.852
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

50:44.434 --> 50:46.449
What are you doing?

50:48.226 --> 50:49.779
Stop it!

50:50.000 --> 50:51.353
Stop it!

50:51.740 --> 50:53.613
Adam, stop it!

50:54.455 --> 50:56.115
Stop it!

50:56.508 --> 50:57.859
Stop it!

51:01.899 --> 51:04.496
You're hurting me! Gene!

51:04.717 --> 51:06.662
You're hurting me!

51:10.042 --> 51:13.481
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

51:14.878 --> 51:17.095
Throw him out!

51:17.556 --> 51:19.252
Throw him out!

51:20.061 --> 51:22.078
Damn you, Adam!

51:22.670 --> 51:24.438
Throw him out!

51:30.812 --> 51:32.472
Get out!

52:11.902 --> 52:13.978
Let's hide it.

52:59.151 --> 53:01.227
There's one.

53:17.208 --> 53:19.984
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

53:20.202 --> 53:24.579
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

53:27.091 --> 53:30.116
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

53:32.204 --> 53:36.653
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

53:36.867 --> 53:39.679
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

53:39.894 --> 53:41.946
Yes, there was.

53:42.155 --> 53:45.073
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

53:45.286 --> 53:48.027
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

53:54.855 --> 53:57.037
There was an accident.

53:57.255 --> 54:00.896
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

54:02.684 --> 54:05.115
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

54:05.467 --> 54:07.648
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

54:11.868 --> 54:15.451
Maybe it happened so late it's
not in today's paper.

54:15.660 --> 54:17.879
There's nothing?

54:19.071 --> 54:21.431
Not that I can see.

54:23.073 --> 54:24.496
That's okay.

54:29.195 --> 54:30.999
Thanks.

54:32.639 --> 54:34.407
Diane.

54:38.972 --> 54:41.676
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

54:42.416 --> 54:44.492
Rita, you want something?

54:46.591 --> 54:51.005
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

54:58.352 --> 55:00.428
What is it, Rita?

55:08.406 --> 55:12.855
I remember something.
I remember something!

55:15.887 --> 55:19.327
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

55:19.542 --> 55:21.937
Maybe that's my name!

55:27.404 --> 55:30.464
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.136
I'm gonna call.

55:40.764 --> 55:44.868
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it's not me.

55:53.882 --> 55:55.542
Hello, it's me.

55:55.760 --> 55:57.836
Leave a message.

56:00.005 --> 56:02.081
That's not my voice.

56:03.484 --> 56:06.155
But I know her!

56:07.555 --> 56:13.250
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that's your roommate.

56:13.470 --> 56:17.776
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

56:19.106 --> 56:21.051
Maybe.

56:21.437 --> 56:23.655
Maybe, maybe...

56:57.762 --> 56:59.600
Adam Kesher?

57:03.084 --> 57:05.658
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

57:05.867 --> 57:08.371
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

57:08.581 --> 57:09.826
Get out!

57:12.026 --> 57:13.723
Adam Kesher?

57:18.984 --> 57:22.663
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

57:24.307 --> 57:26.846
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

57:27.057 --> 57:29.109
She said leave. Here's the door.

57:29.317 --> 57:30.705
Gene!

57:31.197 --> 57:32.549
Get out!

57:33.250 --> 57:34.744
Get out!

57:38.990 --> 57:40.615
Adam Kesher?

58:03.311 --> 58:06.265
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

58:06.477 --> 58:09.989
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

58:10.895 --> 58:13.184
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

58:15.244 --> 58:19.313
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

58:19.976 --> 58:21.779
My bank?

58:22.725 --> 58:25.536
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

58:27.005 --> 58:28.949
What'd they say?

58:29.162 --> 58:32.840
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

58:33.059 --> 58:36.320
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

58:38.104 --> 58:40.120
That's unbelievable.

58:41.757 --> 58:43.489
Well, look...

58:45.967 --> 58:50.867
I don't know what's going on.
That is so much baloney.

58:53.343 --> 58:59.143
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

58:59.952 --> 59:04.959
But I'm sorry, it's my duty
to inform you...

59:06.286 --> 59:11.008
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

59:11.227 --> 59:13.896
they know where you are.

59:15.019 --> 59:16.822
Right.

59:17.837 --> 59:19.819
I'm sorry.

59:43.409 --> 59:44.440
Hello?

59:44.801 --> 59:48.408
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

59:48.768 --> 59:53.110
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

59:53.326 --> 59:57.526
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.001
- And?
- You're broke.

01:00:00.215 --> 01:00:01.568
I'm not broke!

01:00:02.094 --> 01:00:04.382
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

01:00:05.886 --> 01:00:10.158
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

01:00:10.722 --> 01:00:12.418
"The Cowboy"?

01:00:13.436 --> 01:00:15.726
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

01:00:16.323 --> 01:00:20.558
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

01:00:20.777 --> 01:00:23.802
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:27.900
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

01:00:28.119 --> 01:00:31.417
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

01:00:31.842 --> 01:00:35.068
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.664
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

01:00:40.088 --> 01:00:44.988
- What's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

01:00:46.385 --> 01:00:48.982
And getting stranger.

01:00:50.595 --> 01:00:53.999
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:59.218
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

01:00:59.641 --> 01:01:04.992
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:08.577
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:11.219
Will you meet with him?

01:01:11.436 --> 01:01:12.646
Yeah.

01:01:12.863 --> 01:01:16.931
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

01:01:17.245 --> 01:01:20.995
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

01:01:21.874 --> 01:01:26.002
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

01:01:26.431 --> 01:01:31.580
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:35.089
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

01:01:35.304 --> 01:01:38.294
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

01:01:38.504 --> 01:01:42.051
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

01:01:42.262 --> 01:01:45.216
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

01:01:57.329 --> 01:02:01.433
It's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It's not too far away.

01:02:02.859 --> 01:02:05.077
What's wrong with that?

01:02:05.886 --> 01:02:08.248
I'm not sure about this.

01:02:09.645 --> 01:02:12.705
I know you're afraid of something.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:16.321
We'll be careful. I promise.

01:02:16.985 --> 01:02:20.568
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.831
and we'll find out.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:38.270
It'll be okay.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.043
It's probably Coco.

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:51.042
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

01:02:52.823 --> 01:02:55.148
Who are you?

01:02:55.884 --> 01:02:58.626
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.463
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

01:03:03.678 --> 01:03:07.497
No, it's not!
That's not what she said.

01:03:07.957 --> 01:03:11.991
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

01:03:12.968 --> 01:03:16.265
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

01:03:16.482 --> 01:03:19.886
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

01:03:20.553 --> 01:03:25.179
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:28.615
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:31.894
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

01:03:32.659 --> 01:03:35.851
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:39.024
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

01:03:39.237 --> 01:03:44.480
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

01:03:44.699 --> 01:03:48.731
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

01:03:48.944 --> 01:03:51.755
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

01:03:51.971 --> 01:03:54.367
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.596
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

01:03:56.807 --> 01:03:59.962
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

01:04:00.181 --> 01:04:04.072
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

01:04:05.156 --> 01:04:07.445
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:10.264
Good night.

01:04:49.274 --> 01:04:51.292
Cowboy...

01:05:58.582 --> 01:06:01.772
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

01:06:04.357 --> 01:06:06.646
Beautiful evening.

01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:13.670
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

01:06:13.891 --> 01:06:15.908
nice hotel downtown.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.569
No problem.
What's on your mind?

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.598
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

01:06:25.162 --> 01:06:27.939
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:29.993
Whatever.

01:06:31.461 --> 01:06:33.893
A man's attitude...

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:39.218
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

01:06:39.915 --> 01:06:42.453
Is that something
you might agree with?

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.987
Sure!

01:06:45.205 --> 01:06:49.024
Did you answer because that's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

01:06:49.241 --> 01:06:51.293
or did you think about what I said...

01:06:51.501 --> 01:06:55.737
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

01:06:56.512 --> 01:07:00.225
I agree with what you said. Truly.

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:05.062
What'd I say?

01:07:06.951 --> 01:07:10.877
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

01:07:12.481 --> 01:07:14.914
So since you agree...

01:07:15.126 --> 01:07:20.203
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:22.428
How's that?

01:07:23.963 --> 01:07:26.288
Well, stop for a little second...

01:07:26.538 --> 01:07:30.393
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

01:07:32.626 --> 01:07:35.817
Okay. I'm thinking.

01:07:39.237 --> 01:07:44.872
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

01:07:45.639 --> 01:07:49.910
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

01:07:50.128 --> 01:07:52.345
Can you try that for me?

01:07:52.563 --> 01:07:56.240
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:02.433
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.597
One.

01:08:05.298 --> 01:08:08.560
So let's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

01:08:08.776 --> 01:08:13.427
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

01:08:15.736 --> 01:08:18.166
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

01:08:19.145 --> 01:08:25.018
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:30.970
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

01:08:31.393 --> 01:08:34.345
"This is the girl."

01:08:34.697 --> 01:08:38.337
The rest of the cast can stay.
That's up to you.

01:08:39.254 --> 01:08:42.551
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

01:08:44.508 --> 01:08:49.028
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:55.082
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

01:08:55.712 --> 01:08:57.301
Good night.

01:09:23.337 --> 01:09:27.157
- You're still here?
- I thought that's what you wanted.

01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:31.443
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

01:09:31.653 --> 01:09:34.679
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

01:09:34.889 --> 01:09:38.957
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:43.160
- But you won't.
- Lf you're trying to blackmail me...

01:09:43.866 --> 01:09:46.533
it's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:49.113
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

01:09:49.398 --> 01:09:52.731
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

01:09:52.946 --> 01:09:55.971
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

01:09:56.182 --> 01:09:58.329
This will be the
end of everything.

01:09:58.548 --> 01:10:01.395
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

01:10:01.609 --> 01:10:05.500
Stop! Just stop it! That's what
you said from the beginning.

01:10:06.341 --> 01:10:09.568
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.

01:10:09.786 --> 01:10:12.218
Get out of here before...

01:10:13.091 --> 01:10:16.389
- Before what?
- Before...

01:10:16.605 --> 01:10:21.195
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

01:10:24.817 --> 01:10:28.221
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

01:10:28.435 --> 01:10:31.425
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

01:10:34.488 --> 01:10:38.202
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

01:10:39.395 --> 01:10:41.648
Thank you, darling.

01:10:56.441 --> 01:10:59.074
Hi, there. Who are you?

01:11:02.252 --> 01:11:04.090
Betty?

01:11:10.914 --> 01:11:13.904
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:29.871
What is it, Coco?

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.579
Your aunt called.

01:11:33.113 --> 01:11:34.606
I was afraid of that.

01:11:34.818 --> 01:11:37.699
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

01:11:38.645 --> 01:11:41.527
It's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

01:11:41.741 --> 01:11:44.101
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

01:11:44.315 --> 01:11:47.411
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

01:11:47.622 --> 01:11:49.459
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

01:11:49.675 --> 01:11:51.963
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

01:11:53.222 --> 01:11:57.291
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

01:11:57.502 --> 01:11:59.305
Honey, you're a good kid...

01:11:59.522 --> 01:12:02.676
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:05.606
Even though it
comes from a good place.

01:12:05.818 --> 01:12:08.249
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

01:12:09.019 --> 01:12:12.210
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

01:12:12.776 --> 01:12:16.382
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

01:12:16.987 --> 01:12:20.593
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

01:12:20.814 --> 01:12:25.085
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

01:12:34.696 --> 01:12:36.748
Is everything all right?

01:12:36.957 --> 01:12:42.165
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

01:12:42.385 --> 01:12:47.592
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

01:13:07.506 --> 01:13:09.937
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

01:13:10.359 --> 01:13:13.383
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

01:13:13.595 --> 01:13:17.484
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

01:13:47.797 --> 01:13:48.934
"Voilà!"

01:13:49.813 --> 01:13:52.660
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:55.057
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

01:13:56.147 --> 01:13:59.242
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

01:13:59.452 --> 01:14:01.777
and will do the scene with you.

01:14:02.513 --> 01:14:04.589
Bob Rooker, our director...

01:14:04.809 --> 01:14:06.827
and Julie Chadwick.

01:14:07.385 --> 01:14:11.418
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:14.690
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:19.064
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:22.751
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

01:14:23.215 --> 01:14:26.999
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

01:14:27.807 --> 01:14:33.228
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

01:14:35.602 --> 01:14:36.882
Hi.

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:41.191
So, shall we give it a go?

01:14:41.969 --> 01:14:45.717
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

01:14:45.934 --> 01:14:47.808
No, I'm fine.

01:14:48.022 --> 01:14:51.012
Well then,
let's everyone take a seat.

01:14:54.075 --> 01:15:00.197
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

01:15:00.409 --> 01:15:03.398
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:06.764
Something to Betty
before we begin?

01:15:06.984 --> 01:15:09.487
No. It's not a contest.

01:15:10.811 --> 01:15:12.580
The two of them...

01:15:13.491 --> 01:15:16.029
with themselves.

01:15:16.692 --> 01:15:20.406
So don't play it for real...

01:15:20.624 --> 01:15:23.540
until it gets real.

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:30.323
Okay.

01:15:30.957 --> 01:15:33.211
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:34.495
What?

01:15:34.715 --> 01:15:38.392
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:42.191
what's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:46.568
That's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

01:15:46.788 --> 01:15:49.563
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:56.454
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

01:15:57.155 --> 01:16:00.145
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

01:16:00.357 --> 01:16:03.726
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

01:16:03.942 --> 01:16:05.257
- What's your name?
- Betty.

01:16:05.471 --> 01:16:10.514
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

01:16:10.725 --> 01:16:16.455
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

01:16:19.215 --> 01:16:22.061
Dad's best friend goes to work.

01:16:23.217 --> 01:16:24.745
Bob?

01:16:27.078 --> 01:16:28.607
And...

01:16:29.409 --> 01:16:31.141
action!

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.025
You're still here.

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:40.052
I came back.

01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:43.769
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

01:16:43.987 --> 01:16:45.482
Really?

01:16:45.693 --> 01:16:49.798
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.738
So, surprise!

01:16:52.339 --> 01:16:57.344
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

01:17:13.387 --> 01:17:16.376
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

01:17:17.736 --> 01:17:20.405
If you're trying to blackmail me...

01:17:20.867 --> 01:17:23.299
it's not gonna work.

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:29.143
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:33.873
Get out.

01:17:35.828 --> 01:17:38.462
Get out before I call my dad.

01:17:39.342 --> 01:17:42.854
He trusts you. You're his...

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:45.848
best friend.

01:17:49.746 --> 01:17:52.558
This will be the end
of everything.

01:17:54.895 --> 01:17:58.643
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

01:17:59.245 --> 01:18:01.189
Stop.

01:18:01.679 --> 01:18:03.696
Stop it.

01:18:05.159 --> 01:18:07.971
That's what you said from
the beginning.

01:18:09.368 --> 01:18:13.711
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

01:18:20.885 --> 01:18:22.997
So get out of here...

01:18:23.217 --> 01:18:25.020
before...

01:18:28.435 --> 01:18:30.689
Before what?

01:18:48.685 --> 01:18:50.737
Before...

01:18:51.364 --> 01:18:54.104
I kill you.

01:19:08.586 --> 01:19:11.468
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

01:19:19.999 --> 01:19:22.430
I hate you.

01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:25.591
I hate us both.

01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:44.140
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

01:19:48.181 --> 01:19:50.648
Well, there it was.

01:19:51.311 --> 01:19:56.212
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

01:19:57.157 --> 01:19:58.367
Bob?

01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:02.783
Very good. Really.

01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:09.365
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

01:20:11.595 --> 01:20:14.170
Very good. Really!

01:20:14.692 --> 01:20:16.460
Really.

01:20:21.861 --> 01:20:27.032
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

01:20:27.252 --> 01:20:28.878
I mean, it was...

01:20:29.098 --> 01:20:31.007
extraordinary.

01:20:31.498 --> 01:20:33.372
You've done your aunt proud today.

01:20:33.585 --> 01:20:37.334
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

01:20:37.552 --> 01:20:41.893
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

01:20:42.563 --> 01:20:45.861
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

01:20:46.077 --> 01:20:49.861
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

01:20:50.077 --> 01:20:53.517
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

01:20:53.731 --> 01:20:58.144
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

01:20:58.357 --> 01:21:01.168
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

01:21:01.384 --> 01:21:04.611
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

01:21:05.177 --> 01:21:06.386
Bye.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.655
Bye!

01:21:14.118 --> 01:21:17.036
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:19.745
God, that was awful!

01:21:20.729 --> 01:21:25.107
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

01:21:25.322 --> 01:21:29.628
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

01:21:29.845 --> 01:21:32.941
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

01:21:33.185 --> 01:21:35.202
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:39.896
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

01:21:40.109 --> 01:21:43.715
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

01:21:43.937 --> 01:21:46.570
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt's.

01:21:46.789 --> 01:21:49.886
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

01:21:50.095 --> 01:21:53.120
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

01:21:53.504 --> 01:21:59.234
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

01:22:00.045 --> 01:22:02.821
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

01:22:03.037 --> 01:22:04.770
who's a head above the rest.

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:07.311
He's got a project
you will kill for.

01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:10.335
Knock right out of the park!

01:22:12.084 --> 01:22:14.895
Sixteen reasons

01:22:15.111 --> 01:22:20.841
Why I love you

01:22:21.825 --> 01:22:25.194
- One
- The way you hold my hand

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:28.115
- Two
- Your laughing eyes

01:22:28.332 --> 01:22:31.594

01:22:31.812 --> 01:22:34.837
- Four
- Your secret sighs

01:22:35.674 --> 01:22:41.024
They are part
of sixteen reasons

01:22:41.241 --> 01:22:46.521
Why I love you

01:22:47.781 --> 01:22:50.876
- Five
- The way you comb your hair

01:22:51.087 --> 01:22:54.183
- Six
- Your freckled nose

01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:57.761
- Seven
- The way you say you care

01:22:57.976 --> 01:23:01.451
- Eight
- Your crazy clothes

01:23:01.665 --> 01:23:03.952
That's just half

01:23:04.168 --> 01:23:06.839
Of sixteen reasons

01:23:07.058 --> 01:23:12.337
Why I love you

01:23:13.771 --> 01:23:17.106
- Nine
- Snuggling in the car

01:23:17.322 --> 01:23:20.062
- Ten
- Your wish upon a star

01:23:20.279 --> 01:23:23.825
- Eleven
- Whispering on the phone

01:23:24.036 --> 01:23:26.741
- Twelve
- Your kiss when we're alone

01:23:26.958 --> 01:23:29.769

01:23:29.985 --> 01:23:33.140

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.385
- Fifteen
- You say we'll never part

01:23:36.596 --> 01:23:40.000
- Sixteen
- Our love's complete

01:23:40.423 --> 01:23:42.748
Those are all

01:23:43.033 --> 01:23:45.702
Of sixteen reasons

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:51.591
Why I love you

01:23:52.878 --> 01:23:56.140
Sixteen reasons

01:23:56.358 --> 01:24:01.400
Why I love you

01:24:03.422 --> 01:24:08.108
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

01:24:08.327 --> 01:24:10.865
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:14.160
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:17.263
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

01:24:17.478 --> 01:24:20.431
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

01:24:20.644 --> 01:24:23.004
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

01:24:23.218 --> 01:24:27.940
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

01:24:28.159 --> 01:24:31.219
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:34.241
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

01:24:36.175 --> 01:24:37.978
Hank? Where's Hank?

01:24:38.472 --> 01:24:40.939
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

01:24:42.297 --> 01:24:44.694
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

01:24:45.604 --> 01:24:48.486
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

01:24:54.754 --> 01:24:58.361
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

01:24:58.965 --> 01:25:01.431
Okay, here we go.
Let's lock it up, please.

01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:04.526
- Roll sound, please.
- That's fit.

01:25:04.741 --> 01:25:06.614
Playback and action.

01:25:20.572 --> 01:25:22.931
Why haven't I told you?

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:26.618
Oh, baby, I told

01:25:26.833 --> 01:25:28.636
Every little star

01:25:28.852 --> 01:25:33.122
Just how sweet I think you are

01:25:33.339 --> 01:25:37.610
Why haven't I told you?

01:25:38.315 --> 01:25:42.586
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

01:25:44.891 --> 01:25:48.746
Made my heart an open book

01:25:49.414 --> 01:25:54.042
Why haven't I told you?

01:25:56.964 --> 01:26:00.713
Friends ask me
Am I in love

01:26:00.931 --> 01:26:04.785
I always answer “yes"

01:26:05.001 --> 01:26:08.856
Might as well confess

01:26:09.072 --> 01:26:12.618
If the answer's yes

01:26:13.003 --> 01:26:17.001
Maybe you may love me too

01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:21.176
Oh, my darling, if you do

01:26:21.632 --> 01:26:25.072
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

01:26:35.897 --> 01:26:38.008
This is the girl.

01:26:43.065 --> 01:26:45.603
Excellent choice, Adam.

01:26:57.017 --> 01:26:58.961
Oh, my goodness.

01:27:08.568 --> 01:27:10.584
I have to be somewhere.

01:27:10.795 --> 01:27:13.083
I promised a friend.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.567
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.046
Should be around here.

01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:47.287
259O. That's it.

01:27:47.675 --> 01:27:50.486
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

01:27:59.436 --> 01:28:01.937
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

01:28:02.323 --> 01:28:05.727
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

01:28:07.124 --> 01:28:09.795
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

01:28:58.548 --> 01:29:01.289
Selwyn, number 12.

01:29:24.956 --> 01:29:27.352
Now you got me scared.

01:29:51.677 --> 01:29:53.064
You see?

01:29:53.278 --> 01:29:56.303
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

01:30:58.131 --> 01:30:59.519
Betty, wait. Wait!

01:31:02.062 --> 01:31:03.557
Don't.

01:31:30.036 --> 01:31:32.503
No one's home.

01:31:32.715 --> 01:31:34.341
Yes?

01:31:35.708 --> 01:31:37.546
Diane?

01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:41.403
Number 17.

01:31:43.188 --> 01:31:45.726
But it said number 12.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.483
I switched apartments with her.

01:31:49.693 --> 01:31:53.549
She's in 17.
It's down at the end, on the left.

01:31:58.184 --> 01:32:01.101
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

01:32:03.228 --> 01:32:05.518
We'll leave her a note.

01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:07.715
I'll go with you.

01:32:09.735 --> 01:32:12.202
She still got some of my stuff.

01:32:17.634 --> 01:32:20.550
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:39.193
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

01:33:16.816 --> 01:33:19.556
There's still no one home, I guess.

01:33:48.964 --> 01:33:51.562
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

01:33:52.721 --> 01:33:55.355
Come on, I'll open the front door.

01:33:56.132 --> 01:33:57.721
No!

01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:04.022
Come on.

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:10.184
Come on!

01:36:35.727 --> 01:36:38.502
I know what you're doing.

01:36:59.038 --> 01:37:01.954
I know what you have to do.

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:06.929
But let me do it.

01:37:15.113 --> 01:37:17.994
Let me do it.

01:37:40.337 --> 01:37:43.563
You look like someone else.

01:38:05.248 --> 01:38:07.158
Good night, Betty.

01:38:07.371 --> 01:38:10.147
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

01:38:10.502 --> 01:38:12.091
What?

01:38:12.311 --> 01:38:14.115
The wig!

01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:19.714
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

01:38:20.384 --> 01:38:22.851
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

01:38:23.062 --> 01:38:27.226
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

01:38:27.586 --> 01:38:29.662
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

01:39:01.856 --> 01:39:05.191
It's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

01:39:14.416 --> 01:39:16.563
Thank you, Betty.

01:39:17.269 --> 01:39:21.991
It's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

01:39:22.210 --> 01:39:24.013
No, I mean...

01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:27.002
thank you for everything.

01:39:31.257 --> 01:39:32.881
You're welcome.

01:39:43.051 --> 01:39:45.518
Good night, sweet Betty.

01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.271
Good night.

01:40:39.103 --> 01:40:41.772
Have you ever done this before?

01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:45.285
I don't know.

01:40:45.505 --> 01:40:47.094
Have you?

01:41:01.231 --> 01:41:04.148
I want to with you.

01:41:29.726 --> 01:41:32.752
I'm in love with you.

01:41:46.739 --> 01:41:49.730
I'm in love with you.

01:42:15.861 --> 01:42:18.672
Silence.

01:42:19.479 --> 01:42:21.840
Silence.

01:42:23.272 --> 01:42:25.810
Silence.

01:42:26.752 --> 01:42:29.421
There's no band.

01:42:30.405 --> 01:42:33.003
There's no band.

01:42:33.884 --> 01:42:36.695
There's no orchestra.

01:42:38.233 --> 01:42:40.345
Silence!

01:42:55.524 --> 01:42:58.586
- Rita?
- There's no band.

01:42:59.144 --> 01:43:01.504
Rita, wake up!

01:43:05.406 --> 01:43:07.030
It's okay. It's okay.

01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:09.268
No, it's not okay.

01:43:10.207 --> 01:43:12.569
What's wrong?

01:43:13.305 --> 01:43:16.010
Go with me somewhere.

01:43:17.445 --> 01:43:20.884
It's two o'clock. It's two
o'clock in the morning.

01:43:24.543 --> 01:43:27.568
Go with me somewhere.

01:43:27.778 --> 01:43:29.795
Sure.

01:43:30.006 --> 01:43:31.500
Now?

01:43:33.242 --> 01:43:35.186
Right now.

01:45:09.408 --> 01:45:12.433
There's no band!

01:45:13.305 --> 01:45:16.401
There is no band!

01:45:21.447 --> 01:45:23.356
This is all...

01:45:23.986 --> 01:45:26.383
a tape recording.

01:45:26.596 --> 01:45:29.550
There's no band, and yet...

01:45:30.387 --> 01:45:32.891
we hear a band.

01:45:33.415 --> 01:45:36.512
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

01:45:37.069 --> 01:45:38.943
listen...

01:45:52.621 --> 01:45:55.813
A muted trombone.

01:46:09.843 --> 01:46:13.698
A muted trumpet.

01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:34.336
It's all recorded.

01:46:36.739 --> 01:46:39.693
There's no band!

01:46:41.054 --> 01:46:42.997
It is all...

01:46:43.594 --> 01:46:45.954
a tape.

01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:03.007
It is an illusion.

01:47:07.809 --> 01:47:09.647
Listen!

01:48:23.066 --> 01:48:29.152
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

01:48:29.606 --> 01:48:32.347
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

01:48:32.563 --> 01:48:35.790
Rebekah del Rio.

01:48:55.423 --> 01:48:58.864
I was all right

01:48:59.076 --> 01:49:02.138
For a while

01:49:02.346 --> 01:49:08.848
I could smile for a while

01:49:09.062 --> 01:49:12.466
But I saw you last night

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:16.678
You held my hand so tight

01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:23.842
As you stopped to say hello

01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:28.893
You wished me well and you

01:49:29.102 --> 01:49:32.364
Couldn't tell

01:49:32.582 --> 01:49:38.277
That I've been crying

01:49:38.497 --> 01:49:41.486
Over you

01:49:41.698 --> 01:49:45.137
Crying

01:49:45.351 --> 01:49:47.947
Over you

01:49:48.482 --> 01:49:54.355
Since you said “so long"

01:49:54.919 --> 01:50:01.420
I've been miserable and alone

01:50:01.843 --> 01:50:05.698
Lonesome and crying

01:50:06.226 --> 01:50:09.180
Crying

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:12.936
Crying

01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:15.652
Crying

01:50:15.865 --> 01:50:22.566
It's hard to understand

01:50:22.787 --> 01:50:29.289
That upon seeing you again

01:50:29.503 --> 01:50:33.775
I'd be crying

01:50:34.512 --> 01:50:37.633
I thought

01:50:37.854 --> 01:50:40.950
That I was over you

01:50:41.158 --> 01:50:48.111
But it's true, so true

01:50:48.327 --> 01:50:51.802
I love you even more

01:50:52.015 --> 01:50:55.561
Much more than I did before

01:50:55.771 --> 01:51:01.645
But darling, what can I do

01:51:01.861 --> 01:51:07.697
You don't love me anymore

01:51:07.914 --> 01:51:14.867
And I will always be

01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:22.038
Crying over you

01:51:22.248 --> 01:51:28.334
Crying over you

01:51:28.547 --> 01:51:34.834
Your love has captured

01:51:35.052 --> 01:51:40.853
The whole of my heart

01:51:41.072 --> 01:51:44.821
That was left crying

01:51:45.039 --> 01:51:48.300
Crying

01:51:48.517 --> 01:51:51.673
Crying

01:51:51.893 --> 01:51:55.333
Crying

01:53:16.071 --> 01:53:18.123
Betty?

01:53:21.150 --> 01:53:22.882
Betty?

01:53:34.963 --> 01:53:37.776
Where are you?

01:56:20.890 --> 01:56:22.730
Hey, pretty girl.

01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:25.653
Time to wake up.

01:58:02.765 --> 01:58:05.824
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

01:58:06.487 --> 01:58:09.441
My lamp and dishes.

01:58:11.253 --> 01:58:14.172
Come on, Diane,
it's been three weeks.

01:58:16.543 --> 01:58:19.638
I put your dishes in that box.

01:58:39.575 --> 01:58:43.216
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

01:58:54.988 --> 01:58:59.330
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

01:59:08.730 --> 01:59:10.878
This is it?

01:59:16.491 --> 01:59:20.037
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

02:00:14.003 --> 02:00:16.114
Camilla!

02:00:18.699 --> 02:00:20.989
You've come back.

02:02:02.452 --> 02:02:05.442
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

02:02:05.967 --> 02:02:07.733
I said...

02:02:08.192 --> 02:02:10.932
you drive me wild.

02:02:23.503 --> 02:02:25.933
We shouldn't do this anymore.

02:02:32.304 --> 02:02:34.665
Don't say that.

02:02:39.367 --> 02:02:42.286
Don't ever say that.

02:02:42.499 --> 02:02:44.408
Don't, Diane!

02:02:44.621 --> 02:02:46.080
Stop it!

02:02:46.291 --> 02:02:47.951
Diane, stop!

02:02:49.110 --> 02:02:51.816
I've tried to tell you this before.

02:03:00.313 --> 02:03:02.567
It's him, isn't it?

02:03:14.161 --> 02:03:17.459
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:21.744
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

02:03:26.268 --> 02:03:29.566
Don't sit so rigid, just...

02:03:29.782 --> 02:03:31.276
just relax.

02:03:32.148 --> 02:03:36.276
Now, the two of you are alone
and it's real comfortable.

02:03:37.924 --> 02:03:40.557
Like you've known
each other forever.

02:03:40.777 --> 02:03:44.075
Even if you don't say anything,
it's real comfortable.

02:03:45.787 --> 02:03:49.263
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

02:03:49.476 --> 02:03:52.358
- Let's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

02:03:52.572 --> 02:03:55.168
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

02:03:56.225 --> 02:03:59.487
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

02:03:59.704 --> 02:04:03.250
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

02:04:03.462 --> 02:04:05.265
Diane!

02:04:10.664 --> 02:04:14.032
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

02:04:16.162 --> 02:04:20.990
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

02:04:24.965 --> 02:04:27.017
And when you kiss her...

02:04:28.583 --> 02:04:31.571
it's just a continuation
of that move.

02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:36.052
There's no break.

02:05:00.975 --> 02:05:03.192
Kill the lights!

02:05:13.569 --> 02:05:16.346
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

02:05:16.561 --> 02:05:20.203
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

02:05:20.424 --> 02:05:23.270
No fucking way!
It's not gonna be!

02:05:24.043 --> 02:05:26.581
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

02:06:50.712 --> 02:06:53.973
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

02:06:56.696 --> 02:06:58.428
Diane?

02:07:02.959 --> 02:07:05.876
- Hello?
- Diane?

02:07:07.481 --> 02:07:08.904
Camilla.

02:07:09.117 --> 02:07:13.007
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

02:07:13.953 --> 02:07:16.206
You coming?

02:07:21.677 --> 02:07:25.948
Good. It means so much to me.

02:07:26.687 --> 02:07:30.328
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

02:07:30.759 --> 02:07:33.534
It's been waiting, okay?

02:07:37.821 --> 02:07:39.624
Okay.

02:07:39.838 --> 02:07:43.802
It's 698O, Mulholland Drive.

02:07:44.744 --> 02:07:46.927
Mulholland Drive.

02:08:56.349 --> 02:08:59.718
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

02:09:04.595 --> 02:09:06.647
A surprise.

02:09:29.575 --> 02:09:31.415
Shortcut.

02:09:33.993 --> 02:09:36.497
Come on, sweetheart.

02:09:41.823 --> 02:09:43.767
It's beautiful.

02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:46.305
A secret path.

02:10:54.017 --> 02:10:56.201
Perfect timing.

02:10:56.906 --> 02:10:59.052
Welcome, Diane.

02:11:04.665 --> 02:11:08.210
Well...
Here's to love.

02:11:18.755 --> 02:11:21.601
Here's to love.

02:11:26.376 --> 02:11:28.523
Here she is!

02:11:37.091 --> 02:11:39.939
I don't believe
you met my mother.

02:11:40.641 --> 02:11:43.071
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

02:11:43.285 --> 02:11:46.962
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

02:11:47.355 --> 02:11:50.274
Well, let's eat!
I'm starving!

02:11:56.609 --> 02:11:58.722
I'm sorry I was late.

02:12:19.156 --> 02:12:21.790
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

02:12:22.357 --> 02:12:26.141
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

02:12:29.002 --> 02:12:31.778
I always wanted to come here.

02:12:32.587 --> 02:12:35.777
I won this jitterbug contest.

02:12:36.483 --> 02:12:39.639
That sort of led to acting.

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:43.645
You know, wanting to act.

02:12:44.346 --> 02:12:46.813
When my aunt died...

02:12:47.999 --> 02:12:50.953
Anyway, she left me some money.

02:12:51.688 --> 02:12:54.392
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

02:12:55.514 --> 02:12:56.902
Yes.

02:12:58.367 --> 02:13:00.693
How did you meet Camilla?

02:13:02.473 --> 02:13:06.327
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

02:13:06.544 --> 02:13:09.498
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

02:13:09.710 --> 02:13:12.343
- What a pity!
- Then go!

02:13:21.958 --> 02:13:24.874
I wanted the lead so bad.

02:13:26.307 --> 02:13:29.710
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

02:13:32.848 --> 02:13:34.792
The director...

02:13:35.004 --> 02:13:36.949
Bob Rooker?

02:13:37.161 --> 02:13:38.929
Yes.

02:13:41.477 --> 02:13:44.288
He didn't think so much of me.

02:13:48.469 --> 02:13:51.316
Anyway, that's when
we became friends.

02:13:52.889 --> 02:13:54.442
She helped me...

02:13:54.975 --> 02:13:58.071
getting some parts in some
of her films.

02:14:00.404 --> 02:14:02.456
I see.

02:14:17.313 --> 02:14:21.476
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

02:14:23.853 --> 02:14:27.780
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

02:14:34.396 --> 02:14:37.171
Sometimes, good things happen.

02:15:30.865 --> 02:15:33.605
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

02:15:37.058 --> 02:15:40.463
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

02:15:44.225 --> 02:15:46.657
Camilla and I...

02:15:58.803 --> 02:16:00.607
are going to be...

02:16:13.209 --> 02:16:15.261
Sorry about that.

02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:24.852
No, I'm fine.

02:16:30.569 --> 02:16:33.144
This is the girl.

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:37.070
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

02:16:37.771 --> 02:16:41.032
It's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

02:16:42.642 --> 02:16:45.074
You got the money?

02:16:45.288 --> 02:16:47.364
I sure do.

02:16:58.579 --> 02:17:02.291
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

02:17:05.745 --> 02:17:08.282
You sure you want this?

02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:16.039
More than anything in this world.

02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:29.681
When it's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:46.272
What's it open?

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.502
Silencio.
