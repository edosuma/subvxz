WEBVTT

00:11.272 --> 00:13.143
pass above Austin skies,

00:13.187 --> 00:15.058
tragedy loomed just below.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.669
<i>Local rancher, Marv Davidson,</i>

00:17.713 --> 00:20.107
<i>appears to have burned alive</i>
<i>in his own barn</i>

00:20.150 --> 00:22.674
<i>late last night.</i>
<i>While authorities have not yet</i>

00:22.718 --> 00:24.024
<i>identified the cause</i>
<i>of the blaze,</i>

00:24.067 --> 00:26.809
<i>we were able to speak</i>
<i>with Mrs. Davidson</i>

00:26.852 --> 00:29.768
to recount the details
of the gruesome scene.

00:29.812 --> 00:32.032
It figures that he would, uh,

00:32.075 --> 00:34.034
he would run into
a-a burning building,

00:34.077 --> 00:37.124
you know, to protect those kids.
He was...

00:37.167 --> 00:39.822
He was always sacrificing.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.085
The weight of
the accident on your daughter

00:42.129 --> 00:45.741
- must've been...
- Oh, it-it was, uh,

00:45.784 --> 00:48.352
- it was no accident.
- I'm-I'm sorry?

00:50.267 --> 00:51.790
Um...

00:51.834 --> 00:53.923
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.099
If someone is at fault here,

00:56.143 --> 00:58.841
I think people have
a right to know.

01:00.843 --> 01:03.411
I believe it-it was,
it was the kid next door

01:03.454 --> 01:05.978
who started this fire.

01:06.022 --> 01:09.025
I mean, his family's
always been after mine.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.767
He's responsible.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.509
Cordell Walker
murdered my husband.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.380
<i>Cordell Walker...</i>

01:18.643 --> 01:19.818
What are you doing?

01:20.950 --> 01:23.431
I had never seen that.
Mom and Dad

01:23.474 --> 01:24.997
asked me to
never watch it,

01:25.041 --> 01:28.044
and I guess part of me
never wanted to watch it.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.003
- Yeah, for good reason.
- Yeah.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.701
Why would you even
go looking for that?

01:32.744 --> 01:34.833
I couldn't sleep.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.444
You know, I got
to thinking about

01:36.487 --> 01:38.489
the last time
Davidsons had to move.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.404
It's not your fault.

01:40.448 --> 01:43.668
Yeah, yeah, no, I-I, uh...

01:43.712 --> 01:44.713
Okay.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.062
I got to get
a ride in.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.803
Daddy's waiting.
He's gonna be really happy.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.413
Listen, I want
to cut a deal

01:49.457 --> 01:51.067
with the Davidsons
after the race.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.722
I need you to take a look
at the proposal.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.680
Please.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.336
You know what's crazy about this
whole thing?

01:59.380 --> 02:00.642
I went to law school,

02:00.685 --> 02:01.860
I worked at
the best firm

02:01.904 --> 02:04.863
in Manhattan, I was almost
district attorney,

02:04.907 --> 02:07.344
and all of this will be decided

02:07.388 --> 02:08.911
- by a horse race.
- Okay.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.086
All right, hot shot.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.783
You'll be fine, okay?

02:11.827 --> 02:14.482
It's me racing.
You know I'm gonna win.

02:14.525 --> 02:15.874
Our land's
at stake.

02:15.918 --> 02:18.355
I just think that
we should try and cut a deal

02:18.399 --> 02:20.749
- before the race, not after.
- No.

02:20.792 --> 02:21.880
I don't want
the Davidsons thinking

02:21.924 --> 02:23.143
we're scared of a challenge.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.362
We are going to race tomorrow.
We have to,

02:25.406 --> 02:26.798
but we don't

02:26.842 --> 02:29.061
- have to start a war.
- Please.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.759
All right.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.637
Okay, I think...

02:39.681 --> 02:40.682
I think it's over.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.598
Oh, thank you.

02:48.472 --> 02:51.606
You bought the wrong cleaner
at the store.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.608
I bought cleaner
that doesn't clean?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.654
Yeah.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.396
Do you have any idea how much

02:59.440 --> 03:00.571
you embarrassed me yesterday?

03:00.615 --> 03:02.791
Drunk...

03:02.834 --> 03:04.706
in front of
the new Ranger.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.752
I'm sorry.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.798
I know I said it
a million times, but I'm sorry.

03:09.841 --> 03:12.148
Yeah, and it's completely lost
its meaning.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.585
We cannot keep
doing this, Dan.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.108
We cannot.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.633
I am so sick
of being the monster

03:18.676 --> 03:20.896
and just repeating myself
all the time.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.202
It is not fair.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.726
It's not fair to me.
It's not fair to Cole.

03:24.769 --> 03:25.901
You got to go.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.512
You got to just go

03:28.556 --> 03:29.818
before I get home from work.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.820
Just stop
dragging this out.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.517
Denise, I got
nowhere else to go.

03:33.561 --> 03:36.041
Well, you always seem
to figure something out.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.099
Cleaner? Seriously?

03:50.142 --> 03:53.755
Please, Mom, you and
Dad invented that fight, okay?

03:53.798 --> 03:55.974
Honey, he knows
about the race.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.149
How?

03:57.193 --> 03:59.064
We can't lose him, okay?

03:59.108 --> 04:00.849
He's our best shot
at winning tomorrow.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.633
Why? Because of some summer job

04:02.677 --> 04:04.548
- he had working for a jockey?
- Okay, but...

04:04.592 --> 04:07.029
Come on.
He worked with that jockey
for five summers.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.813
Do you want the first time
back on a horse

04:08.857 --> 04:10.772
since college to be racing
for this family?

04:10.815 --> 04:12.861
If it comes down to it. Fine.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.123
But, you know what?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.124
This race isn't gonna happen

04:15.167 --> 04:16.473
if I have anything
to do with it.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.083
Now, I got to get to work.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.869
Whoa, whoa. Right now
with everything going on?

04:24.220 --> 04:26.701
Mom, I reopened
the investigation

04:26.744 --> 04:28.268
into Dad's death,

04:28.311 --> 04:30.487
and I need solid evidence
against the Walkers

04:30.531 --> 04:31.836
before this feud makes headlines

04:31.880 --> 04:33.534
because you know
they're just gonna accuse me

04:33.577 --> 04:35.057
of abusing county resources.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.842
What... What're you saying?
You could lose your job?

04:37.886 --> 04:41.281
I would never be able
to be D.A. again.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.197
Uh, here you go.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.157
Hey.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.028
Do you remember the lantern

04:50.072 --> 04:51.769
Cordell brought into our barn,

04:51.813 --> 04:52.944
right, the night of the fire?

04:52.988 --> 04:54.772
Yeah, we always
had lanterns in there.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.862
I'm talking about the one
that he brought.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.821
The one that he left

04:59.864 --> 05:01.910
when you two were
in the hayloft together.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.651
What are you trying to say?
What, he tampered with it?

05:03.694 --> 05:05.174
I-- Come on.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.655
That's a stretch, Mom.
I mean, he was just a kid,

05:07.698 --> 05:08.830
and they never found
that lantern.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.832
Until a few weeks ago,

05:10.875 --> 05:12.137
when the Walkers found it

05:12.181 --> 05:13.704
and kept it

05:13.748 --> 05:15.097
secret.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.188
Tell me everything you know.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.631
Hey. Morning.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.329
Sorry, uh...

05:29.372 --> 05:31.113
Well, there he is.

05:31.156 --> 05:34.290
You having nightmares again?
You look God awful.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.902
Oh, that's very sweet.
Thanks, uh... Coach.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.818
Uh, I'm here. I'm ready.
What-What's the play?

05:40.862 --> 05:42.559
- All right, well, let me see.
- Let's get to work.

05:42.603 --> 05:45.214
How about
if we, um...

05:48.870 --> 05:50.175
Chopper?

05:50.219 --> 05:52.047
I mean, he-he's

05:52.090 --> 05:54.266
fast as hell, but has he
ever raced before?

05:54.310 --> 05:56.356
I mean...Well, not as such, but

05:56.399 --> 05:59.097
I'm telling you, it's the best
horse I've ever bred.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.317
This rookie'll get you
to the finish line first.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.234
Okay, okay.

06:05.277 --> 06:08.019
Great. Then, uh, I guess...

06:10.108 --> 06:11.762
Whoa, okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.025
What's-what's going on?
Just the-- Okay.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.287
All right, all right.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.377
Shh...He's protecting himself.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.031
Looks like I'm not
the only one who senses

06:20.075 --> 06:21.598
something off about you.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.340
Is there something you're
not telling me?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.214
Okay.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.739
I've been thinking, Dad,
maybe we should...

06:31.782 --> 06:33.958
I think we should cut a deal
with the Davidsons

06:34.002 --> 06:35.307
tomorrow, after we win.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.005
Cordell, I-I don't want
to hear it.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.746
I've put together a list
of terms and conditions.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.964
Oh...They-they-they

06:40.008 --> 06:41.792
can at least keep living
on their ranch.

06:41.836 --> 06:42.967
Hear me out.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.274
If we extend
an olive branch,

06:45.317 --> 06:48.712
we can end this
stupid family feud

06:48.756 --> 06:50.975
once and for all
without any more casualties.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.196
Shots have been fired.

06:54.239 --> 06:55.632
Lines have been drawn.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.242
And somehow,

06:57.286 --> 07:00.811
the Davidsons are always right
there when you turn around.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.816
Now, you've tried to be
a peacekeeper for...

07:05.860 --> 07:06.948
way too damn long now.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.865
Everything is on the line now.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.433
Our land. Our legacy.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.738
I get it.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.088
You focus on that.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.774
I, uh...

07:52.472 --> 07:55.300
I had a dream
about you last night.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.476
Um...

07:57.825 --> 08:00.654
We were on top
of the water tower,

08:00.697 --> 08:02.264
the one downtown.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.920
But when I looked out...

08:09.837 --> 08:11.708
...all I could see was fire.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.842
You were screaming,

08:14.885 --> 08:16.626
and I was frozen.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.505
Bon and I aren't really talking.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.422
It's the secrets, I guess.

08:32.424 --> 08:35.253
We keep them, for what?

08:35.297 --> 08:37.342
For who?

08:37.386 --> 08:40.345
And, somehow,

08:40.389 --> 08:42.434
there's always

08:42.478 --> 08:44.524
something we lose.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.183
All right, you got
your back straight,

08:52.227 --> 08:54.229
now get your head forward.
Focus where you're going.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.187
- I know how to ride a horse.
- Well, it doesn't look like it.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.276
- Well, he's not going.
- Oh, my Lord.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.582
Whoa. Easy.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.149
Yippee ki-yay, cowboy.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.107
Got your horse nip
you requested.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.587
Oh, this is my new ranch hand.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.416
Coach.
What?

09:07.459 --> 09:09.636
Just consider me your new
assistant for the day.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.681
Whatever you need,
I'm here.
Mm.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.292
- Go on!
- And if he does
anything wrong,

09:14.336 --> 09:15.946
I hold him,
you slap him.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.122
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.430
Oh, don't answer.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.432
Don't even think about
answering it.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.957
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- The hell you thinking, boy?

09:27.001 --> 09:28.655
Whoa.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.092
Whoa. No! Chopper.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.267
It was Denise.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.531
- Could've been about the race.
- Oh, my Lord.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.059
- Great.
- Yeah, right.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.148
It's not me, it's Chopper.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.541
Why don't I just ride
a different horse?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.151
It has nothing to do
with the horse.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.239
I'll show you.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.416
Take one of those sugar cubes,

09:51.460 --> 09:54.115
- give it to Chopper.
- Yes, sir.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.160
Come here, come here.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.509
- Watch her.
- Oh, yeah.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.163
Good boy.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.208
Yeah, I think your dad's right.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.383
This horse is pretty much
making out

10:01.426 --> 10:02.427
with my hand right now.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.516
Really?

10:04.560 --> 10:07.432
Y-You really took the morning
off work for this?

10:07.476 --> 10:10.044
Yes, and it was
totally worth it.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.654
Okay. All right.

10:11.698 --> 10:14.265
Fine. It's not Chopper, it's me.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.528
I'm in my head.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.574
And my riding is off.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.185
Okay. You know what?
Why don't you go on

10:21.229 --> 10:23.187
back to the house.
You're done here.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.667
- What?
- Well, you said it yourself.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.451
You can't race.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.583
So, I will.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.655
August. Hey.

10:55.698 --> 10:56.786
Hey, Mrs. Davidson.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.658
Um... yeah, Colton
isn't here right now.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.224
Oh, no, um...

11:00.268 --> 11:02.400
I've been trying to reach your
dad all morning. Is he here?

11:02.444 --> 11:04.054
I haven't heard
from him all day.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.490
Well, in that case,
would you mind

11:05.534 --> 11:07.318
if I asked you
a couple questions?

11:07.362 --> 11:09.059
Sure. I mean,
do I need a lawyer

11:09.103 --> 11:10.452
or something?
Like...

11:11.540 --> 11:13.716
A lantern was stolen
off my property

11:13.760 --> 11:16.501
a couple weeks ago,
and you have been

11:16.545 --> 11:18.547
named as a person
involved in the incident,

11:18.590 --> 11:21.158
so would you have any idea
where it could be?

11:21.202 --> 11:23.117
Okay, you're really gonna
confront a kid like this?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.335
I have been trying
to find your father.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.773
And catching Augie
on his own is pretty low.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.731
We're not
the bad guys here.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.603
August, I just need you
to answer that one question.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.649
What's going on here?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.172
You know what?
This doesn't involve you,

11:35.216 --> 11:36.696
so just...
Well,

11:36.739 --> 11:38.306
when you're in
my place of business,

11:38.349 --> 11:41.178
talking to kids who are
practically my blood,

11:41.222 --> 11:44.094
I would say yeah, mm-hmm,

11:44.138 --> 11:45.443
it does concern me.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.359
Okay.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.144
Why don't we find
some neutral ground then?

11:50.187 --> 11:51.711
How's Ranger HQ?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.103
I don't think
that's gonna be necessary.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.104
Yeah, no, that-that-that's fine.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.105
Let's just, um...

11:55.149 --> 11:56.759
get this over with.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.240
Great.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.415
Great.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.112
- Augie.
- It's fine.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.635
Okay, I'll go with you.

12:03.679 --> 12:06.638
You know what?
You are not his legal guardian,

12:06.682 --> 12:08.162
but don't worry,

12:08.205 --> 12:09.729
he'll be in good hands.

12:09.772 --> 12:10.860
Let's go.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.865
Augie.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.694
Dad's not picking up. It's going
straight to voice mail.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.263
I told him to come earlier,
so maybe he's on his way.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.699
Okay, you stay here
in case he does.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.483
- You hold down the fort.
- Wait, where are you going?

12:25.527 --> 12:27.355
I'm gonna go find
that damn lantern.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.844
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

12:37.887 --> 12:39.019
He always, he always

12:39.062 --> 12:40.063
does this.
He has to,

12:40.107 --> 12:41.369
he has to do
everything

12:41.412 --> 12:44.024
- alone.
- My God. The snacks in this house

12:44.067 --> 12:46.156
are unreasonably good.
I mean, your mom

12:46.200 --> 12:48.245
has, like, three different types
of homemade trail mix.

12:48.289 --> 12:51.031
- All right.
- I mean, I am so invested
in this race now.

12:51.074 --> 12:54.164
I mean, yes, obviously,
I was before-- Hey. What?

12:54.208 --> 12:56.732
I mean, obviously,
I was before, but

12:56.776 --> 12:59.822
- now it's personal.
- Oh, what I was saying...

12:59.866 --> 13:01.084
Daddy.
Mm-hmm.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.912
He's being irrational.
Am I right?

13:02.956 --> 13:04.348
He doesn't need
to agree with me.

13:04.392 --> 13:05.349
I'm not saying that,

13:05.393 --> 13:06.786
but he won't even
hear me out

13:06.829 --> 13:08.048
about cutting a deal
with the Davidsons.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.964
I mean, look,

13:11.007 --> 13:12.835
he has a point.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.272
The horse thinks
you're a fool.

13:15.316 --> 13:18.232
And why would you offer to cut
a deal with the Davidsons

13:18.275 --> 13:20.364
when they're just trying
to take everything from you?

13:20.408 --> 13:22.062
- Hey, sorry.
- Hey, Ger.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.237
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.892
Denise

13:25.935 --> 13:27.110
just ambushed Augie
at the bar.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.982
She took him to Ranger HQ
for questioning.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.114
What?

13:31.158 --> 13:32.986
For questioning about what?

13:35.292 --> 13:37.817
- About the lantern.
- The...

13:37.860 --> 13:39.340
The lantern? What...

13:39.383 --> 13:41.255
- what lantern?
- I-- Denise

13:41.298 --> 13:44.911
said that Augie
might've taken a lantern

13:44.954 --> 13:46.782
from the Davidsons' old barn.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.088
Okay, hold on.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.480
Augie told me he-he

13:49.524 --> 13:51.134
went to the barn.
He-he said he hurt his shoulder

13:51.178 --> 13:52.396
climbing around.
He-he didn't say

13:52.440 --> 13:53.833
he-he took anything.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.444
What-what's-what's
going on here?

13:56.487 --> 13:58.011
Did-did you know
about this?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.013
Okay.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.450
Where is this lantern?

14:03.973 --> 14:05.888
Buried it.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.935
That damn thing has caused
this family nothing but grief.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.415
It's better off six feet under.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.504
That wasn't your decision
to make alone.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.072
Can't you see
that all these

14:16.116 --> 14:17.508
damn secrets end up hurting us

14:17.552 --> 14:19.946
more than anything the Davidsons
could ever do to us?

14:23.079 --> 14:26.256
I have to ask you this,

14:26.300 --> 14:28.563
and I need you to shoot me
straight.

14:30.217 --> 14:33.873
Where did you bury that lantern?

14:39.095 --> 14:41.532
Stel.
Have you heard from Augie?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.447
No, your father
has it handled.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.319
He never should've taken
that stupid thing.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.363
I told him not to,

14:46.407 --> 14:48.191
but he just had to show off,

14:48.235 --> 14:50.846
and then I know Colton
got involved somehow.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.979
Okay, okay, let's-let's
get you home.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.068
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

14:59.028 --> 14:59.986
Stella. Don't.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.248
Hey.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.597
I know our friendship

15:02.640 --> 15:04.425
doesn't mean anything
to you anymore,

15:04.468 --> 15:07.254
but you really didn't have to
sell out my brother to your mom.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.996
I'm-I'm sorry, what?

15:10.039 --> 15:11.345
And what the hell did we do

15:11.388 --> 15:13.216
to make you hate us so much?

15:14.565 --> 15:16.872
You're a Walker.
Okay, I'm a Davidson.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.178
I guess this just
wasn't meant to be.

15:18.221 --> 15:21.007
You don't mean that. You,

15:21.050 --> 15:23.400
of all people,
wouldn't believe that.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.273
But, hey, I guess you weren't
really who I thought you were.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.971
How do you want
to fight this, kid?

15:29.015 --> 15:31.408
- Stella.
- You know,

15:31.452 --> 15:34.020
the only thing I wanted
when we moved here was a home.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.370
They're taking our ranch
tomorrow, and I know,

15:36.413 --> 15:38.372
I know you and Mom
aren't happy.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.461
There's nothing left
to fight for anyways, Dad.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.555
Stel.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.035
Dan.

15:49.078 --> 15:52.081
You came to me
when you needed help.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.561
Now, I'm gonna ask
the same of you.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.390
Let's cut a deal, okay?

15:56.433 --> 15:59.306
20 acres of the Walkers' land

15:59.349 --> 16:01.525
and we call off this race.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.050
- 20 acres?
- Yeah.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.965
Let's find some common ground.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.367
Augie, hey, come here.
Come here.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.068
Hey, it's okay.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.983
Hey, why don't you, uh,

16:24.026 --> 16:26.289
wait outside
for me, okay?

16:27.464 --> 16:29.249
Okay.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.294
Yeah.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.691
Okay, before you
fly off the handle...

16:36.734 --> 16:38.127
I know things escalated

16:38.171 --> 16:39.476
between our families,
Denise...

16:41.087 --> 16:42.697
...but you shouldn't have
involved my son.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.094
He involved himself

16:48.137 --> 16:50.313
the second he trespassed
onto my property.

16:50.357 --> 16:54.056
He's 15 years old. He's a kid.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.451
You remember when we were kids?
Like-like, at all?

16:57.494 --> 17:00.193
Did you tell your children the
significance of this lantern?

17:00.236 --> 17:02.369
I'm not answering that question.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.979
Just curious,

17:04.023 --> 17:05.589
why would they keep it
after they found it?

17:05.633 --> 17:07.461
What else is your family hiding?

17:07.504 --> 17:10.072
What else is my...
You know what?

17:10.116 --> 17:12.466
Despite everything, Denise,

17:12.509 --> 17:14.250
I tried
to help you,

17:14.294 --> 17:16.078
to help your family,

17:16.122 --> 17:17.471
but you

17:17.514 --> 17:19.386
involved my child.

17:19.429 --> 17:22.128
You started a war,

17:22.171 --> 17:23.694
and there ain't no going back
from that.

17:23.738 --> 17:27.046
Then I will see you
on the field tomorrow.

17:28.525 --> 17:29.657
So be it.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.589
Oh, uh...

17:48.632 --> 17:50.634
I'm pretty sure you're
not supposed to be here, hon.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.465
Liam offered us
a portion of land

17:55.509 --> 17:57.163
to call off the race.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.207
20 acres.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.253
What did you say?

18:00.296 --> 18:03.430
My son doesn't deserve 20 acres.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.214
He deserves the whole damn plot.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.348
You want to race tomorrow.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.393
I want to show Colton

18:10.437 --> 18:12.526
that there is still something
worth fighting for.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.442
Well, Denise
was against this, but

18:15.485 --> 18:17.531
she said she'd ride
if it came down to it.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.707
No, no, no. You got to tell her
the race got pushed back.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.491
I have to ride.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.624
You know I'm the only one
that can win against Walker.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.279
Hmm...

18:26.322 --> 18:28.194
And how are you so sure?

18:28.237 --> 18:30.500
Because, when I do,

18:30.544 --> 18:33.199
you're gonna
give me the farmhouse,

18:33.242 --> 18:36.158
and I'm gonna be
right next door to my son.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.379
And knowing that's on the line,

18:39.422 --> 18:41.729
I won't lose.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.577
Ah! God.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.578
Idiot.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.408
Well, ain't that nice.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.547
- Abby?
- No.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.854
Oh, hey.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.509
What can I do for you, New York?

19:22.552 --> 19:24.815
You know, I just, uh...

19:24.859 --> 19:26.252
just wanted to say goodbye.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.429
Wait, are you bleeding?

19:29.472 --> 19:30.821
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, let me see that.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.563
I'm fine, I'm fine.

19:33.607 --> 19:34.564
Okay.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.218
I see where
your son gets

19:36.262 --> 19:38.177
his stubbornness from.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.223
Right, but as your
assistant coach...

19:41.267 --> 19:43.617
Yeah, well... I don't think
I called you that.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.227
It's all good.
It was a vibe I got.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.837
Oh.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.451
You don't have to be
so hard on yourself

19:51.494 --> 19:53.757
for protecting your family.

19:53.801 --> 19:56.456
I would do the same for mine.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.285
Sounds like
there's a story there.

19:59.328 --> 20:02.810
Full transparency, I, uh...

20:02.853 --> 20:05.900
I mean, my old partner's family.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.774
Strong families always have
a stray or two.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.304
Yeah, well...

20:18.347 --> 20:20.262
I'm sorry to pry,

20:20.306 --> 20:22.177
but, uh,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.875
the biggest
land dispute

20:24.919 --> 20:27.661
I've ever dealt with
was in a game of Monopoly.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.793
So... how long

20:29.837 --> 20:32.405
has this feud with the Davidsons
been building?

20:37.714 --> 20:40.978
It was peaceful when Marv and I
were younger, but...

20:42.850 --> 20:44.591
...that was a long time ago.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.335
We all mourned him.

20:49.378 --> 20:52.207
It was hard on Abby,
given her...

20:52.251 --> 20:53.600
history, but,

20:53.643 --> 20:55.428
hell, when...

20:57.604 --> 20:59.301
When he died...

21:01.869 --> 21:03.871
...I felt relieved.

21:03.914 --> 21:05.829
I thought
the land dispute

21:05.873 --> 21:09.224
was gonna be buried with him,
but...

21:09.268 --> 21:12.227
here I am,
dealing with it again.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.709
I guess that's why I'm so
hell-bent that I know what's...

21:17.406 --> 21:18.712
...best.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.715
Maybe you do.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.588
But don't let complications
with another family

21:25.632 --> 21:28.461
affect what you have
with your own.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.289
Let them in.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.694
Stella blue.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.566
I, uh...Mwah.

21:46.609 --> 21:47.567
Brought chili.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.308
Where's your brother?

21:49.351 --> 21:50.874
In his room, being emo.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.702
Well, get him down here.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.922
- I'll make some chili dogs.
- Your dumpster dogs, Dad?

21:54.965 --> 21:56.750
I don't really think
that's gonna help.

21:56.793 --> 21:58.578
Ow.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.886
Can you just sit for a minute?

22:02.930 --> 22:05.976
Maybe lose a little
blackjack with me?

22:06.020 --> 22:08.588
Yeah.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.503
All right, well...

22:10.546 --> 22:12.940
Challenge accepted.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.899
How long do you
think we have

22:15.943 --> 22:17.858
before Denise comes
after us again?

22:22.863 --> 22:23.994
I don't know.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.649
We just have to be careful.

22:26.693 --> 22:30.305
You know, we're-we're not
dealing with an ally anymore.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.526
But... they think
we're the bad guys?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.658
Right?

22:35.702 --> 22:38.400
No. There are no
bad guys here, Stel,

22:38.444 --> 22:39.880
not-not in this situation.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.664
W-We're all just trying to do

22:41.708 --> 22:43.623
whatever we think
is best for our family.

22:43.666 --> 22:44.798
Mm-hmm.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.844
You ready to race tomorrow?

22:48.845 --> 22:50.717
Yeah.
Of course I'm ready.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.415
I mean, you know, there's
a little-little hiccup but...

22:53.459 --> 22:54.808
I'm ready.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.071
Chopper hates me.

22:57.114 --> 22:58.986
A horse hates you?

22:59.029 --> 23:02.337
Okay, maybe-maybe not
hates, okay?

23:02.381 --> 23:05.035
I wasn't focused,
but now I am ready.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.821
And I am ready
for you...

23:07.864 --> 23:09.475
to hit me.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.825
Okay.

23:11.868 --> 23:14.436
Oh. Oh!

23:14.480 --> 23:16.482
Look at that.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.440
How? You never win.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.702
I won today.

23:19.746 --> 23:22.357
What can I say?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.533
Hi.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.364
I'm gonna go
check on Augie.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.496
Okay.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.498
Dad.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.588
You got this.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.774
I'm-I'm not here...

23:47.817 --> 23:49.645
to ask for your forgiveness.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.517
I-I don't even need you
to say anything.

23:53.693 --> 23:57.479
I let the Davidsons have...

23:57.523 --> 23:59.960
more power over me
than I care to admit.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.703
But the truth is,

24:03.746 --> 24:06.880
back then,
I...

24:08.882 --> 24:12.755
I thought there had to be
some different way,

24:12.799 --> 24:14.104
a better way.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.672
So, I kept
putting it off.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.545
But Marv was...

24:19.588 --> 24:22.156
He was hell-bent.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.071
He needed that win.

24:24.114 --> 24:27.466
For some damn reason
I'll never understand.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.164
So, we set it.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.514
Signed on the dotted line.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.825
And then that fire.

24:41.001 --> 24:44.787
And I couldn't help but feel
like I had got what I wanted.

24:47.573 --> 24:51.054
And I don't know how I will ever
forgive myself for it.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.143
You've been through hell, Daddy.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.712
More times than once,
I know that.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.107
But I don't know,

25:00.150 --> 25:01.761
I don't know why
you always insist

25:01.804 --> 25:03.719
on being so damn stubborn.

25:03.763 --> 25:06.766
I mean, you raised me
to walk alongside you,

25:06.809 --> 25:08.158
this whole family.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.551
When it comes
down to it,

25:09.595 --> 25:11.814
you never really let us.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.556
That's why I'm here.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.471
I'm ready

25:16.515 --> 25:19.648
to listen to whatever you have
to say about this deal.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.564
Deal's off.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.612
Deals are off the table.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.224
All I want now is those

25:30.267 --> 25:32.792
damn Davidsons

25:32.835 --> 25:35.664
to never come near us again.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.276
Well, in that case...

25:45.282 --> 25:48.068
Walk alongside me,
Cordell.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.736
I'm gonna finish
what you started.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.321
Abby.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.282
That's funny, isn't it?

26:28.325 --> 26:30.632
The girl you loved and...

26:30.676 --> 26:32.591
the girl you married.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.117
I just wanted
to tell you that history

26:37.160 --> 26:39.598
is not gonna repeat itself...

26:39.641 --> 26:40.729
today.

26:40.773 --> 26:43.776
I'm gonna take back what's ours.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.160
Denise isn't even here.

27:20.203 --> 27:21.901
Dad could've totally
let Augie come.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.859
Ah, she'll be here
in time.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.949
Yeah, you just wait for the
Western showdown music to start.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.692
You know, my dad always dreamed

27:30.736 --> 27:32.868
of owning a piece
of land like this,

27:32.912 --> 27:35.871
and, thanks to you,

27:35.915 --> 27:37.786
I kind of got to

27:37.830 --> 27:38.961
grow up on one.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.703
I think I should be
thanking you.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.489
The reason I know this land
more than anybody

27:45.533 --> 27:47.578
is because all the time
you and I spent

27:47.622 --> 27:49.711
trying to hide
from your dad.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.628
- Oh, Frank.
- Ah, Frank.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.717
Yeah... He always
did catch us.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.806
- He always did. Yeah.
- Always did.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.460
And I never wanted to leave.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.507
You'll never have to.

28:15.563 --> 28:16.782
You two okay?

28:16.825 --> 28:18.914
No.

28:18.958 --> 28:21.047
Um, I-I don't
need it to be.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.745
It's fine.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.529
Ready to go?

28:25.573 --> 28:26.748
Yes, ma'am.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.403
Hey, did you, uh,
you talk to Denise?

28:29.446 --> 28:30.839
Yeah, I called her earlier.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.536
Told her we were
starting late, but...

28:32.580 --> 28:35.104
if she finds out
we were lying...Well, she will find out.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.976
But it's okay 'cause we're
gonna win.

28:37.019 --> 28:40.414
She can yell at me
- from the Walker jacuzzi.
- Oh.

28:40.457 --> 28:43.547
Wait, is this 'cause of
what I said yesterday, Dad?

28:43.591 --> 28:45.811
Like, 'cause that was just
a heat of the moment thing.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.769
I don't actually want
to steal their home.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.771
What you said was truth, Colt.

28:49.815 --> 28:52.687
Right? Heat of the moment
or not.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.694
You know, the way
we left things,

28:59.738 --> 29:00.869
it wasn't fairto you.

29:03.698 --> 29:04.960
It's just those Davidsons,

29:05.004 --> 29:06.570
they makes me so damn angry.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.965
Please, we've all had
our fair share of anger.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.403
You seem better now.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.536
Calm.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.807
As the only person
here not of

29:25.851 --> 29:27.896
Walker or
Davidson blood,

29:27.940 --> 29:29.724
I will read the rules.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.775
<i>The race will start right here</i>

29:36.818 --> 29:38.515
<i>at Walker ranch.</i>

29:38.559 --> 29:40.779
<i>The riders will</i>
<i>make their way to the barn</i>

29:40.822 --> 29:43.129
<i>in between the two properties</i>
<i>and circle</i>

29:43.172 --> 29:45.740
<i>back to the starting position</i>
<i>to finish the race.</i>

29:47.655 --> 29:49.004
Whoever wins,

29:49.048 --> 29:50.876
will have legal claim to both

29:50.919 --> 29:53.226
the Walker
and Davidson land.

30:07.196 --> 30:10.069
- The losing family will need
to vacate the premises

30:10.112 --> 30:11.940
in the most immediate
manner possible.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.512
All right,
listen up.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.777
I know we've had some
interesting times

30:22.821 --> 30:24.126
at the ranch, but

30:24.170 --> 30:26.650
it's ours, always has been.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.783
Whether that's
eating supper

30:28.827 --> 30:30.480
at the dining room table, or...

30:30.524 --> 30:33.701
playing cards
till the fireflies come out.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.705
I love this house.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.534
I love this land. I always have.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.884
But I neverrealized

30:42.928 --> 30:46.192
how much it was home
until yesterday.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.022
It's a part of me.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.762
It's a part of all of us.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.982
So, right now,

30:54.026 --> 30:56.767
I'm gonna go out there,

30:56.811 --> 30:59.988
and I'm gonna protect our own.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.729
We're not going anywhere.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.732
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:04.775 --> 31:07.169
Now, you know
Gale's gonna play dirty.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.172
Just be careful out there.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.261
Yeah, of course.

31:13.741 --> 31:14.698
Son.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.135
Dad?

31:17.658 --> 31:20.879
Listen, when you get to the fork
in the road, you go right.

31:20.922 --> 31:21.923
Okay?

31:21.967 --> 31:24.230
Left is quicker,

31:24.273 --> 31:26.841
but the trees
are overgrown.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.888
Yes, sir.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.715
Cordell.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.022
Um...

31:34.066 --> 31:35.981
Yeah?

31:36.024 --> 31:39.245
You go out there,
and you kick his ass.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.782
Dad?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.755
Attaboy, Chop.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.637
So much wasted land.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.032
I mean, does anyone really need
a treehouse these days?

32:27.075 --> 32:30.122
I do think I'm gonna keep
your mom's garden.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.167
Looks like she worked
real hard on that.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.605
- Okay.

32:35.649 --> 32:36.998
Everyone ready?

32:38.304 --> 32:39.827
On your marks!

32:42.047 --> 32:43.657
Get set!

32:51.317 --> 32:52.883
Go!

32:52.927 --> 32:54.842
- Come on, Cordi!
- Go, Dad!

32:54.885 --> 32:55.843
Go, go, go!

33:22.478 --> 33:24.480
Come on, boy.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.526
Hyah!

33:28.354 --> 33:29.659
Come on.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.406
Come on.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.805
You hurt?

34:30.459 --> 34:31.765
I'm fine.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.549
Can you ride?

34:35.334 --> 34:38.467
- Can you ride?
- Yeah, yes, I can ride.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.555
All right, then get up.

34:42.906 --> 34:44.778
You didn't have to come back,
you know.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.652
Well, I save people
for a living, Dan.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.654
It's who I am.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.221
Thank you.

34:53.265 --> 34:54.918
Besides,

34:54.962 --> 34:56.877
I want you there
to watch me cross

34:56.920 --> 34:58.357
the finish line
in front of you.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.490
Get on your horse.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.144
Let's finish this.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.800
We go on three.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.149
Three.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.672
Two.
One.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.326
Come on, come on, come on!

35:29.736 --> 35:30.911
Come on, Chop.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.913
Come on, Chop.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.726
Come on!

36:06.686 --> 36:08.209
Come on, Chop!

36:47.727 --> 36:49.772
Bonham, Denise
is on her way.

36:49.816 --> 36:51.818
I came to warn you.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.617
Looks like y'all started
on time after all.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.924
Oh, honey. I-I-I thought
you were against all this.

37:10.967 --> 37:13.492
I'm not here for the race.

37:13.535 --> 37:15.058
We examined
that lantern.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.887
Forensics found Daddy's blood
all over it.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.500
That lantern didn't just
start the fire.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.328
It was
a murder weapon.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.373
Dad's death
wasn't an accident.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.766
You were right.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.293
Bonham Walker.

37:32.337 --> 37:35.035
You're under arrest for
the murder of Marv Davidson.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.345
No cuffs.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.911
He can walk.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.052
I...

38:02.802 --> 38:04.630
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.054
Hyah! Hyah!

38:44.757 --> 38:45.975
Hyah! Hyah!
