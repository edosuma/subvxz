WEBVTT

00:08.885 --> 00:10.295
( high-pitched tone)

00:10.386 --> 00:12.217
( crackling )
(both groaning)

00:12.305 --> 00:14.387
What's the matter with you?
I'm the one that just
got shocked.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.509
Yeah, well if you noticed we're
in contact down here.

00:16.601 --> 00:18.592
Man, I got that one
through my ears.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.017
Can you hold still?

00:20.104 --> 00:22.220
Yeah, you know, I could get you
something to stand on.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.101
Listen, I'm almost finished.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.272
So what is it?

00:25.359 --> 00:28.271
Some kind of Peacekeeper
comms enhancer.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.102
Incomplete installation, though.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.941
Moya must have been called into
service as a prisoner transport
before it was finished.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.821
(oscillating tone)

00:35.912 --> 00:38.369
Sweeping Moya's systems
is droid work.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.412
Pilot:
It is vital work.

00:40.499 --> 00:45.619
Any Peacekeeper technology that
remains on Moya may still pose
a threat to us.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.874
It must be identified
and removed.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.549
D'Argo:
How many more Peacekeeper
devices do you expect to find, anyway?

00:51.636 --> 00:53.172
There's no way of knowing.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.423
That's why we must continue
these sweeps.

00:55.514 --> 01:00.725
And the DRDs all have their
regular maintenance duties
to perform.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.769
Despite this, l have assigned
two to assist you.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.643
Two?! Out of hundreds.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.190
How generous of you.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.268
How much longer do you expect
this to take?

01:10.363 --> 01:12.274
That is not a legitimate
quesﬂon.

01:12.365 --> 01:14.230
Considering, as l have
just stated,

01:14.325 --> 01:19.490
l have no data on how many
Peacekeeper devices may
still be concealed.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.663
It will take as long
as it takes.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.581
Look, out here in the Uncharted
Territories,

01:24.669 --> 01:28.833
aren't we a little out of range
for the Peacekeeper radar?

01:28.923 --> 01:33.166
It's possible that Crais might
get close enough to us to
reactivate devices like these.

01:33.261 --> 01:37.220
You may have noticed, he seems
determined to follow us, no
matter where we go.

01:37.306 --> 01:40.844
(oscillating tone)

01:44.855 --> 01:46.891
( frustrated sigh )

01:50.027 --> 01:52.109
(DRDs beeping)

01:57.451 --> 02:01.490
Pilot, I've found some
Peacekeeper control panel.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.740
Pilot:
Can you confirm?

02:02.832 --> 02:04.618
Yes, these are Peacekeeper
markings.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.245
Tell me what I should
do with it.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.291
(static):
Be very careful... which wire...
pull.

02:08.379 --> 02:11.212
One is a direct link to
the propulsion unit.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.005
Pilot, I can't understand you.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.457
What should I do?

02:14.552 --> 02:16.588
( static )

02:16.679 --> 02:17.668
Pilot!

02:17.763 --> 02:19.674
( static continues )

02:24.228 --> 02:25.513
( D'Argo screams )

02:26.272 --> 02:28.137
(grunting)

02:28.232 --> 02:29.392
Pilot!

02:29.483 --> 02:31.223
(grunting)

02:41.412 --> 02:43.949
(grunting)

02:45.166 --> 02:46.656
Pilot, what tier is he on?

02:46.751 --> 02:48.662
Pilot:
l have no indications.

02:48.753 --> 02:51.711
DRDs are searching, but so far,
no sign of him.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.708
D'Argo, can you answer us?

02:53.799 --> 02:56.051
Pilot, where was he last time
you talked to him?

02:56.135 --> 02:58.296
Tier 21.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.467
Peacekeepehn

03:04.268 --> 03:06.259
l have a Peacekeeper
device down here.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.764
( static):
What should... do?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.972
l have a Peacekeeper device
down here.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.433
D'Argo, some kind of
Peacekeeper what?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.899
D'Argo, where are you?

03:18.616 --> 03:20.732
(grunting)

03:21.494 --> 03:23.405
(surprised yell)

03:26.540 --> 03:27.825
What the hell was that?

03:27.917 --> 03:31.751
Pilot:
I've got D'Argo back and
I've got him on scan.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.714
I'm reading some kind of
explosion.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.917
Pilot, what tier is D'Argo on?

03:39.011 --> 03:41.718
He's not on any tier.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.224
What do you mean?

03:52.817 --> 03:55.229
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:55.319 --> 03:58.277
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:58.364 --> 04:01.197
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:01.283 --> 04:04.616
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms...

04:04.703 --> 04:05.488
Help me...

04:05.579 --> 04:07.035
Listen, please.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.159
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:09.250 --> 04:13.163
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

04:13.254 --> 04:15.620
...doing everything I can...

04:15.714 --> 04:18.251
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.776
Aeryn:
Got him.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.610
Pilot, bringing him in now.

04:49.373 --> 04:51.614
He's frozen stiff and he
isn't breathing.

04:51.709 --> 04:54.246
Crichton:
He was in space for half an hour
and there's no way that he's still...

04:54.336 --> 04:56.588
Zhaan:
We must get his respiration
started again.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.835
John, what are you doing? Stop!

04:59.925 --> 05:01.176
Hasn't he suffered enough?

05:01.260 --> 05:02.215
That won't help!

05:02.303 --> 05:03.839
Turn him.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.260
Turn him. Quick.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.517
His pulses are faint.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.896
Deep space interna-thermia.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.189
Maybe he was out there too long.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.141
How long can Luxans survive
in vacuum?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.271
About a quarter of an arn.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.147
Maybe.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.196
Unless they're revived
soon after.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.232
(ship rumbling)

05:30.414 --> 05:31.278
Pilot...

05:31.373 --> 05:33.625
is there something going on
with Moya?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.330
Come on, big guy.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.288
Come on, give me one of those
nasty, smelly breaths.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.633
Give him a chance, John.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.169
( D'Argo gasping)

05:43.260 --> 05:45.091
Whoa!

05:45.179 --> 05:47.295
Pilot, where am I?

05:54.355 --> 05:55.936
Lo'laan.

05:56.649 --> 05:57.889
Lo'laan?

06:00.319 --> 06:02.310
Zhaan:
How do you feel, D'Argo?

06:02.404 --> 06:04.486
I'll be all right.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.406
Didn't think I could be that
clumsy, did you?

06:09.954 --> 06:11.319
Lo'laan...

06:12.081 --> 06:13.696
Lo'laan...

06:13.791 --> 06:15.406
D'Argo, what happened?

06:15.501 --> 06:16.661
What happened with the
explosion?

06:16.752 --> 06:17.787
You mentioned "Peacekeeper."

06:17.878 --> 06:19.209
Did you find a Peacekeeper
device?

06:19.296 --> 06:20.672
l, uh...

06:21.590 --> 06:23.967
I don't remember.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.717
He's unconscious again
but he will survive.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.389
(power dipping)

06:32.476 --> 06:35.468
Pilot, what is going on
with Moya?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.144
Something is wrong?

06:37.231 --> 06:39.688
Aeryn:
Yes, something is wrong.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.891
What about that dip that Moya
took after the explosion?

06:41.986 --> 06:43.692
Have you identified that yet?

06:43.779 --> 06:44.859
Working on it.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.858
Crichton:
You feeling okay?

06:46.949 --> 06:50.282
I'm... working on it.

06:50.369 --> 06:54.738
Getting some odd readings from
some of Moya's systems.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.243
What are these?

06:59.295 --> 07:00.831
Looks like debris.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.877
Crichton:
It's from the, uh, explosion.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.921
(power dipping)

07:06.218 --> 07:09.710
Pilot, what was D'Argo's last
known location?

07:09.805 --> 07:11.261
Right before the explosion?

07:11.348 --> 07:14.306
Uh, tier 21. Aft section.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.303
You okay here?

07:15.394 --> 07:16.224
Yeah.

07:16.312 --> 07:17.347
Lead me that way.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.894
I'm coming with you.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.187
Pilot, how're we doing?
Are we close?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.236
Pilot?

07:28.324 --> 07:30.610
Pilot:
I... believe so.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.282
No further data.

07:32.369 --> 07:38.581
I've been trying to send some
DRDs to assist you but they're
not responding.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.168
Aren't responding?!

07:40.252 --> 07:42.834
I'm working to sort it all out.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.333
(groaning)

07:45.424 --> 07:46.880
Will...

07:46.967 --> 07:48.958
will get back to you.

07:49.053 --> 07:52.136
Whatever's affecting Moya
is bugging Pilot, too.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.177
The explosion.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.347
They have a symbiotic
fusion, right?

07:55.434 --> 07:56.298
Mm-hmm.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.929
Pilot's tendrils run all
through the ship.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.808
Maybe D'Argo set off something
that struck them both.

08:01.899 --> 08:05.483
Man, I am never going to get
used to walking around inside
a living ship.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.026
You have nothing similar
in your culture?

08:08.113 --> 08:12.857
Well, "Jonah and the Whale", but
no, no contemporary parallels.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.078
Except maybe the horse
and rider.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.198
Rider? Is the horse a beast
of burden?

08:17.289 --> 08:20.702
They aren't as large or
sophisticated as Moya here
but kind of similar.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.033
Loyal and intelligent.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.789
That you capture and make
work for you?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.620
Yeah, but we love them, too.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.046
You love what you enslave.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.839
We don't enslave them.

08:29.927 --> 08:33.169
All right, we... all right...
fine. We enslave them.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.515
What is that smell?

08:36.266 --> 08:37.346
Smell?

08:37.434 --> 08:38.765
( sniffing )

08:38.852 --> 08:41.184
Yeah, the air. It's stale.

08:47.403 --> 08:51.897
Pilot, we got a couple of your
little DRD buddies with us
down here after all.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.196
(gasping)

08:53.283 --> 08:56.525
I don't read any Drds
in that section.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.406
Well, they're down here.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.368
(grunting)

09:07.047 --> 09:08.708
(warbling buzz)

09:10.134 --> 09:11.294
(electronic buzzing )

09:11.385 --> 09:12.670
Look out.

09:27.276 --> 09:31.144
Pilot, the scanner seems to
be working less efficiently
than usual.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.816
Pilot?

09:42.624 --> 09:44.205
John, what...?

09:44.293 --> 09:47.785
Aeryn and l were just ambushed
by a couple of DRDs.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.041
Crichton.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.043
Yeah, Aeryn, I'm working on it.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.250
Any suggestions?

09:55.471 --> 09:58.679
Oh, no, don't touch it.
It's like super glue.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.264
Hang on a minute.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.306
What's this?

10:02.394 --> 10:04.885
There's something else
here, look.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.813
Yeah. Looks like that stuff
that was on D'Argo.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.773
I took all that I could from
his hair and clothes.

10:12.863 --> 10:16.651
The scan shows that he may
have aspirated and ingested
some, as well.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.827
Hey, Zhaan.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.621
Could that be part of what's
wrong with D'Argo?

10:24.708 --> 10:27.745
It shouldn't be. The particles
are bio-mechanoid,
just like Moya.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.667
But I think you're right.

10:29.755 --> 10:33.748
They're fragments from Moya's
biopolymer structure.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.298
From the explosion.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.127
Aeryn:
Crichton, have you gotten
a solvent yet?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.463
Yeah, but look at them.
They're identical.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.846
Since when is debris from an
explosion that uniform?

10:46.271 --> 10:48.557
Crichton!

10:54.571 --> 10:58.063
Zhaan said this solvent should
do the trick, but it's
very strong

10:58.158 --> 11:01.150
so I've got to get it only on
the DRD gunk, not on your hand.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.576
Right.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.120
And then we have to rinse it
immediately afterwards

11:05.207 --> 11:07.573
Right, right. Right, let's just
hurry up, shall we?

11:07.668 --> 11:11.035
Excuse me for being careful, but
this stuff could eat through
your skin down to...

11:11.129 --> 11:13.120
Okay, so let's avoid that.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.082
My thought exactly. 80 pipe down
and hold still.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.509
You know I'm going to track down
that stinking little droid and
rip off both its antennae.

11:19.596 --> 11:23.339
Happy place, Aeryn.
Go to your happy place.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.470
Look, there's obviously
something wrong with the DRDS.

11:26.562 --> 11:30.180
We've just got to figure out
what it is before they do some
serious damage to the ship.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.230
If they haven't already.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.225
Okay.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.479
Try it again.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.233
(grunting)

11:38.323 --> 11:39.108
Good.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.190
Good, good. It's working.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.992
Oh, wonderful. At this rate
I'll have two whole fingers
free by tomorrow.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.239
( chuckles )

11:45.330 --> 11:47.537
It's good. You're being
funny again.

11:50.586 --> 11:54.044
You know, you're lucky it only
got your hand and your shoe.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.247
If you'd gotten this stuff
on another body part

11:56.341 --> 11:58.172
it'd be you and Pilot permanent
fixtures on this ship.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.502
Oh, let me guess, is that
you being funny?

12:01.597 --> 12:03.508
This is ridiculous.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.674
Well, it's going to work.

12:07.436 --> 12:08.425
Eventually.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.056
(grunting)

12:10.147 --> 12:11.307
Trust me.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.854
(grunting)

12:12.941 --> 12:15.478
Hey, easy. You're going to
rip your hand off.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.400
(grunts)

12:19.615 --> 12:20.946
See?

12:21.033 --> 12:22.864
Told you it'd work.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.412
A bio-mechanoid virus?

12:28.498 --> 12:31.240
Yeah, left behind by
the Peacekeepers.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.452
As what, another passive weapon
like the paddac beacon?

12:34.546 --> 12:39.165
Exactly. D'Argo must've found
something, did something,
to release it.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.874
Still sting?

12:43.347 --> 12:45.713
Solvent's off, I think.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.301
Good.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.348
Feels fine.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.020
Listen,

12:58.111 --> 13:01.103
if it is a virus which has
infected Moya's systems,

13:01.198 --> 13:03.154
that may be what's got
ahold of Pilot.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.323
D'Argo's still freaking
all over the ship.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.197
That may not be because of
the time he spent outside.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.789
It might be because
of the virus.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.330
But you're saying that this
virus is bio-mechanoid.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.080
That means it shouldn't be able
to affect Pilot or D'Argo.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.913
Well, something is.

13:19.007 --> 13:24.593
And if it is a virus in Moya's
system, it may be in the
atmosphere generators,

13:24.680 --> 13:27.797
which means we could be
breathing it in right now.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.346
The air is stale in here
and the room is cold.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.557
Not exactly what you need,
recovering from interna-thermia.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.563
but I'll see if I can't do
something about it for you.

13:40.654 --> 13:44.112
Lo'laan, you must stop
worrying about me.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.440
You work way too hard.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.288
You are so beautiful.

13:53.375 --> 13:57.163
I can only dream it is because
I make you as happy as
you make me.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.872
I'm glad that I make you
happy, sweet D'Argo,

14:00.966 --> 14:03.173
but I also want to
make you well.

14:03.260 --> 14:07.128
I'm never more alive and healthy
than when I'm with you.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.257
When you look at me,
what do you see?

14:12.352 --> 14:17.312
Hmm, I see...

14:17.399 --> 14:19.264
my future.

14:19.359 --> 14:25.355
No matter what the others say,
| see you and me together.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.452
D'Argo.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.662
Tell me.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.492
Let me help you. Who is Lo'laan?

14:48.597 --> 14:51.589
I don't know. Maybe that's why
the air smells so stale.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.889
Why?

14:52.976 --> 14:55.092
Because of the virus.
It's all over the ship.

14:55.187 --> 14:58.475
That's a hasty conclusion.
Let's wait and see what
Zhaan's analysis shows.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.728
Look, Moya's a living
being, right?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.730
And there are viruses galore
out here in the galaxy.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.860
I mean, what are our chances
that we're going to catch the
Carubian plague or something?

15:08.950 --> 15:11.282
Well, it all depends on each
creature's immune systems,

15:11.369 --> 15:13.701
whether they're capable of
fighting off invaders,

15:13.789 --> 15:16.201
or creating an inhospitable
breeding ground.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.828
Right. But, okay,
Sebaceans for example.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.625
Do you have inoculations?

15:20.712 --> 15:23.089
I mean, how do you guys deal
with all the stuff floating
around out here?

15:23.173 --> 15:25.289
Well, we're born and
bred on ships.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.044
We are in a totally
controlled environment

15:27.135 --> 15:29.797
until we're sent off on our
first Peacekeeper assignment.

15:29.888 --> 15:35.178
Oh. So you guys just zip around
the galaxy hoping you don't
pick up some STD...

15:35.268 --> 15:36.974
space transmitted disease?

15:37.062 --> 15:41.146
No. We're issued a standard
number of inoculations,
as you call them,

15:41.233 --> 15:44.475
against all known destructive
bacterial and viral matter.

15:44.569 --> 15:45.854
Do we have any of that on board?

15:45.946 --> 15:49.154
And if some new, malicious
organism is discovered,

15:49.241 --> 15:53.325
our scientists engineer
an anti-substrate,
a growth blocker,

15:53.411 --> 15:55.072
to stop it from affecting
our system.

15:55.163 --> 15:59.076
So basically, you... you have
no disease.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.328
Basically, yes.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.544
What about Moya?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.498
If anything attacks one of
her systems, she starts
fighting back.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.425
Aeryn, you were born to this.

16:10.512 --> 16:14.346
I mean, this science, you've
had it your whole life.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.764
You have no idea how advanced
this all is to me.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.388
I think I do.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.060
No, I don't think so.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.140
Disease and death are rampant
on my world.

16:24.234 --> 16:31.697
Bacteria and viruses destroy
crops, animals, people, at...
at incalculable rates.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.739
Well, each ecosystem has
its own logic,

16:33.827 --> 16:37.115
so maybe yours is a simpler way
of keeping populations under
control.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.617
No. No, no, no, this is
a better way.

16:39.708 --> 16:43.621
The suffering which you've
managed to avoid with your
science is immeasurable.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.327
Creatures still die out here.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.880
And we find new ways to suffer
and to make others suffer.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.128
Well, I never said earth had
a monopoly on that.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.131
But you say that you want to go
back to this place, Earth.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.259
A place that you tell me has so
much disease and suffering.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.093
Well, you guys don't
have chocolate.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.070
(electronic chirping)

17:24.836 --> 17:26.417
-Aeryn.
-What?

17:30.467 --> 17:33.300
Oh, that's spoiled.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.423
The refrigeration unit
mustn't be working.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.129
Oh...

17:40.602 --> 17:42.467
Whoa!

17:43.396 --> 17:45.728
That definitely ain't working.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.100
Pilot.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.102
Yes?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.900
We got another systems
malfunction to report.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.070
Not... a... malfunction.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.442
I'm seeing...

17:55.533 --> 17:57.444
seeing signs of... inten...

17:57.535 --> 17:58.490
Pilot.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.160
lnten... intentional...

18:01.248 --> 18:02.863
sabotage.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.448
(gasping)

18:06.002 --> 18:07.538
(explosive rumbling )

18:07.629 --> 18:10.871
Moya's struggling to
compensate, to take
control for Pilot.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.499
I can't revive him.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.673
Aeryn, is he dead?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.127
No, but his vitals are
extremely low.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.804
We'll do what we can for him as
soon as we get the ship stable.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.472
I'm getting a lot of peaks
and valleys, here.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.426
Zhaan:
Every system Pilot monitored
is out of control.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.853
Moya's showing major
chemical surges.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.271
It's the virus.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.526
(engines quieting)

18:33.613 --> 18:35.604
Crichton:
How'd you do that?

18:35.699 --> 18:38.736
I think this control is ballast.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.614
And this,

18:41.705 --> 18:43.696
(electronic chirping)

18:43.790 --> 18:44.779
is illumination.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.080
Aeryn...

18:46.167 --> 18:47.953
thanks, you've done it.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.545
I don't know how.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.245
(whispering: )
When Aeryn was injected
with Pilot's DNA

18:52.340 --> 18:54.717
it must've made some kind
of permanent change.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.257
But that was all flushed
out of her.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.174
Was it?

18:57.262 --> 19:00.504
(engine humming)

19:00.598 --> 19:02.179
Aeryn, whatever you're doing,
just keep doing it.

19:02.267 --> 19:05.976
Moya's still working to assume
more control of systems.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.472
She is trying.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.930
But environmentals are still
malfunctioning.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.141
Atmospherics are at a minimum.

19:12.235 --> 19:15.227
What we're breathing now
is all that we've got.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.290
Hmm...

19:29.377 --> 19:32.210
Oh, that's oh.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.246
Hmm... hmm...

19:34.341 --> 19:36.377
Mm... hmm...

19:36.468 --> 19:39.175
Oh, that's... beaut...

19:39.262 --> 19:42.129
Oh, that, oh...

19:42.223 --> 19:44.214
Hmm...

19:45.226 --> 19:47.182
( stifled yawn )

19:47.270 --> 19:49.886
Oh! Uh, uh...

19:49.981 --> 19:51.221
l was just trying to, um...

19:51.316 --> 19:53.181
I know exactly what you're
doing, Jothee.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.686
"Jothee"?

19:54.778 --> 19:55.563
Come here, boy.

19:55.653 --> 19:56.608
"Boy"?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.277
Now.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.273
Oh, no, D'Argo this... this
isn't what it looks like.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.233
I'm not...

20:03.328 --> 20:05.660
Oh, oh!

20:05.747 --> 20:07.658
You're crushing me.

20:07.749 --> 20:11.241
(grunting and groaning)

20:11.336 --> 20:14.123
(fearful stammering )

20:14.214 --> 20:16.000
Now.

20:16.091 --> 20:20.175
What did I say about going
through other people's things?

20:20.261 --> 20:21.876
What is the matter with you?

20:21.971 --> 20:22.881
Hmm...?

20:22.972 --> 20:23.677
Ow!

20:23.765 --> 20:24.675
(laughing)

20:24.766 --> 20:26.381
How dare you handle me this way?

20:26.476 --> 20:29.138
(growling: )
Jothee!

20:29.229 --> 20:30.765
You are so big.

20:30.855 --> 20:34.643
Oh! My size is never a
matter for discussion.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.017
Hey, uh...

20:39.197 --> 20:41.654
I think I know why you're upset.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.108
You're old enough now to realize
that, well...

20:45.203 --> 20:47.740
we're outsiders here.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.163
You look different to the others
and they're treating you
like a stranger.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.911
"Strange" is right.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.959
Well, I know exactly
how you feel.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.332
You know, when your mother's
family first saw me...

20:57.424 --> 20:58.504
What about my mother?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.673
They despised me.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.550
So that's why we had
to get away.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.094
Not far enough.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.388
Well, we came to a place where
no one could tell us

21:07.475 --> 21:09.215
what we thought and
felt was wrong.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.470
Well, I'm telling you.

21:10.562 --> 21:11.472
You're wrong.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.848
Wrong, wrong, wrong...

21:12.939 --> 21:15.305
( playful growling )
(tortured laughing )

21:15.400 --> 21:17.186
(laughing)

21:17.277 --> 21:20.064
Oh, I love you, son.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.066
"Son"? You think I'm you're s...

21:22.157 --> 21:24.239
My, son.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.567
No matter what happens,

21:27.662 --> 21:30.278
I will always love you.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.170
Pilot's tendrils run all
through this ship.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.294
He could've picked up the virus
anywhere, on any tier.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.250
( sneezes )

21:44.345 --> 21:45.425
You okay?

21:45.513 --> 21:47.253
Mm, the air is getting staler.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.554
Yeah, but are you going
to be okay?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.597
For a while, thanks.

21:51.769 --> 21:52.679
Hey, Zhaan.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.180
Hmm?

21:54.272 --> 21:55.808
Can this ship function
without Pilot?

21:55.899 --> 21:59.312
Theoretically, yes. Moya is an
independent living being.

21:59.402 --> 22:02.439
Pilot and the DRDs are merely
servicers in aid of
her operation.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.066
What about the environmentals?

22:04.157 --> 22:05.647
The lights, the air?

22:05.742 --> 22:08.324
Those things are not here to
help keep Moya functioning.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.151
They're here for us.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.578
And Pilot controlled those.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.247
Is there any way for us to
communicate with Moya?

22:15.335 --> 22:16.871
Without Pilot?

22:16.961 --> 22:18.337
I know of none.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.127
I've found something.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.455
Aeryn, what you got?

22:21.549 --> 22:24.086
From what I can read of Pilot's
personal monitoring system

22:24.177 --> 22:26.338
his blood is being
nutrient-starved.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.340
Now, it may not be the only
reason he's unconscious

22:28.431 --> 22:30.217
but it's all I can figure
out for now.

22:30.308 --> 22:33.141
The virus must be starving him.
Get him some nutrients.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.468
I'm on it.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.803
Except it's not a virus.

22:36.898 --> 22:42.359
This test just confirmed that
the particles are not a distinct
organism, like a virus.

22:42.445 --> 22:45.653
They're actually made up of
Moya's genetic material.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.527
They are a part of Moya.

22:48.618 --> 22:51.951
They... they must be fragments
from the explosion.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.324
No, they can't be fragments.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.280
They're all perfectly
uniform in size.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.083
But, John, they are a
part of Moya.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.959
Just before the accident,
D'Argo said he saw some...

23:04.050 --> 23:05.290
Peacekeeper something.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.545
Yes.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.378
Whatever it is, that must
be the answer.

23:22.527 --> 23:26.486
Well, Pilot, I hope this works.

23:28.366 --> 23:29.947
(rumbling)

23:30.034 --> 23:30.944
Oh, no.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.150
Where's D'Argo?

23:32.245 --> 23:33.860
Rygel's watching him.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.240
Rygel?

23:35.331 --> 23:39.040
Rygel? You are not sleeping?!

23:39.127 --> 23:40.913
No, I'm not sleeping.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.711
D'Argo tucked me in and
went for a walk.

23:43.798 --> 23:46.756
He thinks I'm someone
called Jothee.

23:46.843 --> 23:47.923
D'Argo is not with you?

23:48.011 --> 23:49.751
No. Are you not listening?

23:49.846 --> 23:53.304
He went for a walk, and he's
looking for Lo'laan.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.177
Lo'laan.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.514
That's what he called
you earlier.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.061
Mmm.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.364
How you doing?

24:13.870 --> 24:17.158
lfeel...

24:17.248 --> 24:18.283
unsteady.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.869
Yeah.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.576
Look, |, uh, I know a
little while ago

24:23.671 --> 24:26.253
you were floating in deep space
in your street clothes,

24:26.341 --> 24:28.582
and I know you're going through
some stuff because of it,

24:28.676 --> 24:30.257
but we're in deep guano
here, bro.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.210
We need your help.

24:33.348 --> 24:36.090
You need me, Macton?

24:37.060 --> 24:38.470
Macton?

24:41.189 --> 24:43.396
D'Argo, I'm not Macton.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.690
Is this like that name you
called Zhaan?

24:45.777 --> 24:48.018
Was it...

24:48.112 --> 24:49.488
Lo'laan.

24:53.326 --> 24:54.156
Who's Lo'laan?

24:54.243 --> 24:55.983
D'Argo:
Who's Lo'laan?

24:56.079 --> 24:59.822
You may despise your sister
for marrying me, Macton,

24:59.916 --> 25:03.283
but don't mock her by feigning
to forget her name.

25:03.378 --> 25:04.743
Marry.

25:06.089 --> 25:08.546
W-wait a minute, these
people are real?

25:10.093 --> 25:11.333
You were married?

25:13.429 --> 25:15.044
Crichton.

25:15.139 --> 25:17.130
Yeah, D'Argo it's me.

25:18.142 --> 25:21.430
And you're here. On Moya.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.227
Look, we've got trouble.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.350
Big trouble.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.932
We need to know what
happened down there.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.359
What caused the explosion.
We need to know what you saw.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.311
Explosion.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.280
lwas...

25:36.285 --> 25:39.118
l was in some kind of shaft.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.820
There was a shield.

25:40.915 --> 25:44.282
A Peacekeeper shield.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.083
It was holding something back.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.000
Holding back wha...?

25:47.088 --> 25:48.453
(roaring)

25:50.341 --> 25:54.755
Macton, you dare to deny
your own sister's name?

25:54.846 --> 25:59.385
You dare to dishonor her even
though she is dead?!

26:02.437 --> 26:05.349
(agonized sobbing )

26:22.665 --> 26:24.530
Crichton, are you sure this
is such a good idea?

26:24.625 --> 26:28.493
I really can't be certain
of what I'm reading,
what I'm doing.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.249
We don't have a choice, Aeryn.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.625
D'Argo said he found
some kind of...

26:32.717 --> 26:36.630
Peacekeeper shield in a shaft
we have to locate.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.512
Can't D'Argo tell us?

26:41.392 --> 26:43.007
Damn.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.097
(grunting)

26:46.189 --> 26:49.101
No, Aeryn, his memory's
all over the map.

26:49.192 --> 26:51.353
Short-circuited.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.279
Aeryn, we got to be getting
close to the source.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.625
I'm down to emergency lighting
in this section.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.249
Uh-oh. Eyes.

27:13.341 --> 27:16.253
Eyes?

27:16.344 --> 27:19.882
Yeah, like a cave scene in a
Yosemite Sam cartoon.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.179
DRDs, they're blocking
the passageway.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.881
I got to find another route.

27:23.976 --> 27:28.094
There should be parallel
passageways that vector off
on that tier.

27:28.189 --> 27:28.939
I think.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.809
You think?

27:30.900 --> 27:33.687
Look, do you want to come up
here and try and handle these
thousands of controls?

27:33.778 --> 27:35.109
No, no, no, no, I'm vectoring.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.608
l'm... vectoring.

27:54.590 --> 27:59.254
Aeryn? I need a fix on my
current location.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.183
(beeping squeals)

28:09.605 --> 28:11.220
(more beeping squeals)

28:11.315 --> 28:13.601
Holy mother of...

28:19.323 --> 28:20.904
Aeryn?!

28:32.336 --> 28:36.625
Aeryn, shut down the DRDs.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.001
Don't be ridiculous, Crichton.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.333
Just do it!

28:44.974 --> 28:46.714
( panting exhale)

28:49.478 --> 28:51.560
So, where are Rygel and D'Argo?

28:51.647 --> 28:54.138
D'Argo took his son
on an excursion.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.519
What are we going to do about
these? They're vital servicers.

28:56.611 --> 28:58.317
We need them operational.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.316
Well, they're not exactly
operational as it is, Aeryn.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.365
You missed that Hitchcock
picture playing back there a
little while ago,

29:04.452 --> 29:07.285
but a flock of these little guys
just tried to kill me.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.747
And they're not shooting
glue anymore.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.163
Could this be related to what
we've been calling "the virus"?

29:11.250 --> 29:14.208
Crichton:
No, you're right.
It's not a virus.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.910
These guys aren't bio-mechanoid.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.836
They're entirely mechanical.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.255
Wires, gears, servos.

29:19.342 --> 29:23.506
No, a virus wouldn't have
any effect at all.

29:23.596 --> 29:27.384
No, they only do what someone
tells them to do.

29:27.475 --> 29:30.808
But Pilot is unconscious.

29:30.895 --> 29:34.638
Pilot isn't the only one
who controls them.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.563
Moya?

29:37.276 --> 29:38.732
You're saying that...

29:38.819 --> 29:42.277
that Moya ordered the DRDs
to try to kill you?

29:42.365 --> 29:45.607
The DRDs, the shutdown
of the environmentals.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.692
Do you think that Moya is
causing all of this?

29:47.787 --> 29:51.029
Moya has an independent
intellect, right?

29:51.123 --> 29:55.162
Well, maybe the explosion that
D'Argo was involved in
short-circuited that,

29:55.252 --> 29:58.540
or maybe she consciously
cut off Pilot's resources,

29:58.631 --> 30:03.170
in order to prevent him from
keeping us alive.

30:03.260 --> 30:06.923
Our beloved ship may be
trying to kill us.

30:13.729 --> 30:17.142
It would be so much more
efficient to bring up this
data on the view screen.

30:17.233 --> 30:21.272
We can't access Moya's intellect
without letting her know
what we're doing.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.227
I can't believe Moya
doesn't know.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.108
Well, do you know what a few
bacteria are doing
inside of you?

30:25.199 --> 30:28.066
No, you don't know unless
you get a symptom.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.071
My body carries no bacteria.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.787
Aeryn, is this all of them?

30:33.874 --> 30:36.126
I'm sure there's a lot more.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.084
What, exactly are you
expecting to do?

30:42.174 --> 30:48.295
l'm, uh, trying to find a direct
access to Moya's higher
functions.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.425
We may have to shut her down.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.348
But that'd be like...

30:53.436 --> 30:56.348
like when Moya was still wearing
the Peacekeeper control collar.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.054
What if we can't get
it up again?

30:58.149 --> 30:59.889
It may be the only way
to save her.

30:59.984 --> 31:02.316
(rumbling)

31:04.321 --> 31:06.061
And us.

31:08.242 --> 31:12.736
I think the most direct access
point is going to be
in Pilot's chamber.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.411
Aeryn?

31:18.919 --> 31:21.877
You and l, we may have
one other chance.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.587
Rygel, where are you?

31:24.675 --> 31:26.961
Getting a piggyback ride!

31:27.053 --> 31:30.386
Well, see if you can get a ride
back up to command.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.094
You must hold still.

31:39.190 --> 31:42.102
We're up in the mountains,
and the air is very thin.

31:42.193 --> 31:44.104
So, it's mountains now.

31:44.195 --> 31:48.279
Do you know I sincerely believe
you require physical restraints?

31:48.365 --> 31:52.779
You're going to make things
very difficult for your
old man if you...

31:54.789 --> 31:56.575
Hello, D'Argo.

31:59.794 --> 32:01.330
Lo'laan.

32:22.191 --> 32:25.308
The more I know you,
the more I love you.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.438
And the less I understand.

32:29.323 --> 32:33.737
How could you give up everything
to love someone like me?

32:33.828 --> 32:38.242
Yes, sweet D'Argo.
I do so love you, too.

32:38.332 --> 32:42.166
D'Argo:
I am never going to let
you from my life.

32:42.253 --> 32:43.083
D'Argo?

32:43.170 --> 32:44.410
Yes?

32:46.340 --> 32:47.375
I need your help.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.876
Anything.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.678
We are in great danger.

32:51.762 --> 32:54.174
We're in no danger.

32:54.265 --> 32:56.347
Not here.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.685
They're not looking for us
anymore. We're safe.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.010
You, me and Jothee.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.475
We are not safe. Our ship...

33:04.567 --> 33:06.774
Our ship is gone.

33:06.861 --> 33:09.398
l destroyed it soon
after we landed.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.855
There's no way they can
trace us here.

33:14.410 --> 33:17.277
Where is here, sweet D'Argo?

33:29.383 --> 33:30.498
D'Argo!

33:31.510 --> 33:32.670
Macton.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.420
What are you doing?

33:37.349 --> 33:39.260
Here?

33:39.351 --> 33:40.761
With her?

33:42.605 --> 33:44.516
You keep your hands off
my sister.

33:44.607 --> 33:47.223
Your sister?

33:47.318 --> 33:49.229
You have nothing to say
on this, Macton.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.357
l have everything to say on it.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.573
l reject you and l reject
your marriage.

33:58.621 --> 34:03.331
No! You think yourself worthy
of her, when you cower
from her memory.

34:03.417 --> 34:08.161
Her memory burns in
my very soul.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.256
You...

34:22.978 --> 34:24.934
you're dead.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.314
D'Argo.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.525
You have to remember.

34:31.612 --> 34:32.727
I don't want to.

34:32.821 --> 34:36.313
You must. You must remember
everything.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.273
( screams )

34:38.369 --> 34:39.233
Crichton...

34:39.328 --> 34:40.113
D'Argo!

34:40.204 --> 34:42.536
-Remember!
-You killed her!

34:43.916 --> 34:46.202
To keep her from me,

34:46.293 --> 34:48.534
you killed Lo'laan.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.333
Her own brother killed her?

35:06.021 --> 35:08.273
I never had the chance.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.848
You were so young.

35:12.653 --> 35:15.565
I never had the chance to tell
you why your mother and l

35:15.656 --> 35:18.193
went away from the world
that we knew.

35:19.535 --> 35:21.321
Jothee,

35:22.121 --> 35:24.612
please understand.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.199
I had to send you away.

35:30.296 --> 35:35.461
l was charged with your
mother's murder.

35:35.551 --> 35:39.385
Before they could arrest me,
I got you to another
planet safely away.

35:39.471 --> 35:46.183
To a place where I prayed that
Macton and others like him
would never find you.

35:48.314 --> 35:52.353
I had no other choice.

35:52.443 --> 35:58.188
But I can't be sure that you
have remained safe until I see
you again.

35:58.866 --> 36:00.527
I can't...

36:04.663 --> 36:05.903
D'Argo.

36:14.465 --> 36:22.053
When Macton arrested me,
he still had her dried blood
on his hands.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.344
Macton?

36:27.436 --> 36:29.427
I thought you were arrested
by a Peacekeeper.

36:30.773 --> 36:33.810
It was quite a coup for him.

36:36.070 --> 36:39.187
Macton was a Peacekeeper?

36:39.281 --> 36:42.398
lf... if he was a Peacekeeper,
then Lo'laan was...

37:01.345 --> 37:03.381
Your family.

37:29.498 --> 37:33.036
I remember it all.

37:33.127 --> 37:37.837
D'Argo, the explosion
here on Moya.

37:39.425 --> 37:41.211
Do you remember where?

37:53.313 --> 37:57.101
I'm inside the access point to
Moya's higher functions.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.228
I'm almost through the
shutdown procedure.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.820
Zhaan:
We understand, Aeryn.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.156
If you can isolate the
source of the problem

38:03.240 --> 38:06.152
then we may not have to shut
down Moya's higher functions.

38:06.243 --> 38:07.858
But be careful, John.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.695
You may be going right in to
where the particles are
most concentrated.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.208
I can't do it.
I can't get through.

38:16.295 --> 38:19.753
There's no way to shut down
Moya's higher functions.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.501
But I do have access.

38:21.592 --> 38:23.423
I can cut the connections.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.216
Cut them?

38:25.304 --> 38:26.339
Permanently?

38:26.430 --> 38:28.921
This isn't my decision alone.

38:29.016 --> 38:32.929
If I do this, we all have
to be a part of it.

38:35.439 --> 38:37.020
Cut em.

38:43.614 --> 38:45.195
lt's somewhere around here.

38:45.282 --> 38:46.818
It can't be. Aeryn and I
checked this...

38:46.909 --> 38:49.150
No. This way.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.952
The DRDs have sealed it up.

39:01.215 --> 39:04.298
( cutting )

39:04.384 --> 39:06.511
All right, D'Argo, I'm in.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.131
Where's the Peacekeeper panel?

39:08.222 --> 39:09.803
What do you see?

39:10.224 --> 39:11.304
Infinity.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.972
Well, then, you're close
either way.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.516
Thanks a lot.

39:22.236 --> 39:24.022
l've reached a ridge.

39:26.198 --> 39:27.608
Just keep going.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.200
It's not much further.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.492
You better be right, 'cause I
think I'm running low on oxygen.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.864
l'm through the
protective casing.

39:36.959 --> 39:38.324
I'm going in.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.340
I think I've found it.

39:57.271 --> 39:59.387
I'm at the Peacekeeper shield.

40:06.113 --> 40:08.195
It's definitely holding
back the particles.

40:08.282 --> 40:10.147
John, can you see the source?

40:10.242 --> 40:11.527
Hang on.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.324
There's something further down.

40:18.834 --> 40:21.792
Zhaan:
You can't go much further, John.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.709
John, you're almost at
the end of the cable.

40:23.797 --> 40:25.583
I've found the other opening.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.046
There's something through here,

40:32.222 --> 40:34.713
some sort of cavern.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.897
Aeryn:
Okay, I'm cutting now.

40:48.530 --> 40:51.522
John, Aeryn is through.

40:51.617 --> 40:55.405
She's beginning to sever
Moya's higher functions.

40:55.495 --> 40:56.484
Oh, my God.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.116
Crichton, what do you see?

41:00.250 --> 41:01.956
( cutting )

41:06.006 --> 41:07.416
Zhaan:
John...

41:08.884 --> 41:10.465
John, can you hear me?

41:17.225 --> 41:19.261
D'Argo:
Crichton, what do you see?

41:20.937 --> 41:22.723
I'm not sure.

41:24.691 --> 41:27.273
Zhaan, how much do you know
about, uh...

41:27.361 --> 41:29.192
Leviathan physiology?

41:29.279 --> 41:30.564
Not a great deal. Why?

41:30.656 --> 41:32.112
Do you know how they reproduce?

41:32.199 --> 41:33.484
Reproduce?

41:33.575 --> 41:35.315
Yeah, I think, uh...

41:35.410 --> 41:37.947
I think Moya's pregnant.

41:44.544 --> 41:46.580
That's why the particles
are bio-mechanoid.

41:46.672 --> 41:47.912
Yeah, it's a catalyst.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.416
A catalyst for pregnancy.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.590
Then Moya hasn't been trying
to kill us after all.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.133
No. She's...

41:53.220 --> 41:55.677
protecting her baby.

41:59.267 --> 42:00.848
Aeryn:
...cutting... almost...

42:00.936 --> 42:02.517
Aeryn, what was that?

42:02.604 --> 42:05.141
I said I'm almost done.

42:05.232 --> 42:07.063
The higher functions are
almost severed.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.311
-No. Aeryn, stop!
-No. Aeryn, do you hear me!

42:09.403 --> 42:12.520
Aeryn! Listen, you got
to stop cutting.

42:13.323 --> 42:15.063
-Stop!
-If you hear us...

42:16.326 --> 42:17.782
Damn it, Aeryn! Listen to me!

42:17.869 --> 42:19.200
You got to stop cutting!

42:19.287 --> 42:20.538
Now!

42:20.622 --> 42:22.158
All right, stopped.

42:22.249 --> 42:23.204
Why?

42:23.291 --> 42:25.327
We'll explain later.
Just put down the saw.

42:41.309 --> 42:44.016
Moya,

42:44.104 --> 42:48.017
I wish there some way that I
could communicate with you,

42:48.108 --> 42:53.102
and let you know that what
you're doing to nourish
yourbaby

42:53.196 --> 42:55.232
is killing Pilot,

42:56.575 --> 42:58.315
and us.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.240
The DRDs.

43:07.335 --> 43:11.374
The baby needs the DRDs.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.715
We're killing the baby.

43:15.802 --> 43:16.837
Aeryn!

43:16.928 --> 43:19.305
You got to turn back on
the DRDs.

43:19.389 --> 43:21.550
What?

43:21.641 --> 43:25.634
-What is going on down there?
-Aeryn, turn back on
the DRDs now!

44:01.848 --> 44:04.339
Moya...

44:04.434 --> 44:07.141
I don't know if you can hear me
through this DRD.

44:07.229 --> 44:12.599
Hell, I don't even know if you
can understand me without
Pilot translating.

44:12.692 --> 44:18.187
But we would never hurt
you or your baby.

44:18.281 --> 44:22.069
We're happy that you're
having a child.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.194
But do we have to die

44:25.288 --> 44:28.325
so that your baby can live?

44:43.431 --> 44:45.262
Zhaan:
Fresh air.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.841
Crichton, the atmosphere's
back on.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.594
We can breathe again.

44:59.948 --> 45:02.815
Oh, man...

45:03.994 --> 45:06.406
I bet that thing's going
to grow.

45:14.421 --> 45:17.959
Pilot, we're all very glad
to see you up and back
on your feet.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.334
At least up, anyway.

45:19.426 --> 45:22.759
I'm feeling much better,
thank you.

45:22.846 --> 45:24.711
Here's what I don't understand.

45:24.806 --> 45:27.263
How can Moya do this without
your permission?

45:27.350 --> 45:29.090
I'm here to serve her.

45:29.185 --> 45:35.272
She may do whatever she feels
is necessary to ensure
her survival.

45:35.358 --> 45:39.317
And now, I suppose, that extends
to her offspring as well.

45:39.404 --> 45:43.613
To nourish the fetus during the
very tenuous period right
aﬁerconcepﬂon

45:43.700 --> 45:46.237
Moya needed to reroute
a few resources.

45:46.328 --> 45:48.284
Ha! A few resources?

45:48.371 --> 45:51.113
She nearly suffocated ours
and starved you.

45:51.207 --> 45:53.493
That is all behind us.

45:53.585 --> 45:56.497
The fetus is alive and well.

45:56.588 --> 45:59.796
Pilot, there must be other
changes to come as the
fetus develops.

45:59.883 --> 46:02.374
What can we be expecting?

46:02.469 --> 46:05.836
Yeah. Is there some kind of
"What To Expect When
You're Expecting A Baby Leviathan" book?

46:05.931 --> 46:08.263
Dr. Spock? Mr. Spock?

46:08.350 --> 46:11.808
I'm afraid Pilots are not privy
to any special knowledge

46:11.895 --> 46:16.013
regarding the gestation cycle
of Leviathans.

46:16.107 --> 46:20.646
Speaking frankly, I don't know
what we can be expecting.

46:20.737 --> 46:23.194
Well, whatever it is,
we have to remember

46:23.281 --> 46:26.990
the Peacekeepers put up a shield
to keep it from happening.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.452
How are you feeling?

46:37.295 --> 46:39.456
I never had the chance
to say thank you.

46:46.429 --> 46:48.340
Thank me?

46:49.724 --> 46:54.434
Outside the ship, you came
after me in the Prowler.

47:02.112 --> 47:05.320
In all the excitement,
I'd forgotten all about it.

47:05.407 --> 47:06.692
You're welcome.

47:14.249 --> 47:18.083
Your wife's brother,
the one who...

47:18.169 --> 47:20.125
the Peacekeeper.

47:20.213 --> 47:22.329
ls his name Macton?

47:22.424 --> 47:24.415
Macton Towl.

47:27.053 --> 47:29.135
I don't know him.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.895
May | see her?

47:53.747 --> 47:55.112
She's quite beautiful.

47:55.206 --> 47:59.165
Does it surprise you that such a
Sebacean woman would love me?

47:59.252 --> 48:04.918
D'Argo, it's ingrained in
Peacekeepers from birth that we
must keep the bloodlines pure.

48:05.008 --> 48:07.374
That such unions are evil.

48:12.432 --> 48:15.515
Do you therefore think that
my son is evil?

48:15.602 --> 48:17.433
No.

48:24.360 --> 48:27.227
Because in his eyes,

48:27.322 --> 48:29.358
| see you.

48:31.493 --> 48:35.031
D'Argo, no matter what
happens to us,

48:35.121 --> 48:39.205
I will never tell anyone
about your son.
