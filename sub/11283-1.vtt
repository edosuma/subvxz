00:54.655 --> 00:55.687
I got to go in.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.256
Re-upped, 10-33.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.791
I don't speak code.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.259
Soph, I got to go in.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.360
Look, not now,
not today, okay?

01:01.362 --> 01:02.661
We booked it off.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.130
You promised.
It's an officer down, okay?

01:05.132 --> 01:06.131
You know that.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.299
But you promised.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.367
You're not
the only cop.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.802
I'm gonna try
to make it back.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.470
(engine starts)

01:12.273 --> 01:14.540
Ed... not today.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.183
Oh, my God.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.418
Are you okay?

01:26.420 --> 01:27.653
(panting)

01:27.655 --> 01:30.289
Do you want me
to call someone?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.091
Are you hurt?

01:32.093 --> 01:33.392
Do you need
an ambulance?

01:33.394 --> 01:34.393
(clattering)

01:34.395 --> 01:36.361
Let me drive you
to the hospital.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.399
Be careful
putting that in.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.400
Just...

01:41.402 --> 01:43.302
What are you doing?

01:43.304 --> 01:45.838
Wait, no,
don't, no, no!

01:45.840 --> 01:47.473
Stay down!

01:47.475 --> 01:49.408
Stay down!
(sobbing)

01:49.410 --> 01:51.477
My baby!

01:51.479 --> 01:53.378
My baby's in there!

01:53.380 --> 01:55.347
No, my baby's in there!

02:06.160 --> 02:07.793
Greg Loewen.
Who is it?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.761
He was working alone,
trying to recruit a CI,

02:09.763 --> 02:12.764
found himself in the middle
of a gun-buy gone wrong.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.399
Touch and go, Eddie.
He gonna make it?

02:14.401 --> 02:16.401
Hey, boss, we got
a line on the subject.

02:16.403 --> 02:19.204
Seen fleeing in a gold sedan,
no plate I.D.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.205
Male, white.
Okay, good.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.406
Hey, Eddie, I'm
so sorry, buddy.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.908
I know you needed
the day off,

02:22.910 --> 02:25.410
but Leah had a family emergency
and we're shorthanded here.

02:25.412 --> 02:26.845
Yeah, yeah,
and you're nothing without me.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.580
You got my vest
in the car, right?

02:28.582 --> 02:29.998
Yeah.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.415
WINNIE (over headset):
Boss, we just got a 911 call--

02:31.418 --> 02:33.652
carjacking
matching the subject's vehicle.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.387
Beautiful. Where?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.722
Brock Avenue.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.423
Eddie, carjacking, Brock Avenue.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.424
You close?

02:39.426 --> 02:41.293
On Brock?
I'm right here.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.295
PARKER:
Looking for a gold sedan.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.502
ED:
Boss, I got it.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.338
Get a lock on my GPS.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.909
(sobbing)

02:56.911 --> 02:59.645
Ma'am, I'm a police officer.
You okay?

02:59.647 --> 03:01.847
My baby. He has my baby.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.182
Okay.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.684
SPIKE:
<i> Vehicle is a beige sedan,</i>

westbound toward Lakeshore.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.393
You got it.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.761
Winnie, subject
known dangerous,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.396
There's an
infant onboard.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.264
Do not approach, SRU only.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.499

03:34.415 --> 03:36.348
Alix, I need you to breathe.
Breathe.
Okay, just breathe.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.883
Come on, just breathe.
Look, look.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.585
We know you're
worried like hell,

03:39.587 --> 03:40.686
It's okay, it's okay.
but we
gotta fight here, right?

03:40.688 --> 03:42.588
You got to stay strong,

03:42.589 --> 03:44.489
I got out of the car. I don't
know why I got out of the car.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.724
It wasn't your fault, okay?
Don't blame yourself.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.460
Was he carrying anything
besides the gun?

03:48.462 --> 03:51.563
He had a hockey bag.
All right, good.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.600
Hey, boss, we ran the plates
on the subject's car.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.735
They're fakes, so the
car's probably stolen.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.470
We're running
prints now.
Okay.

03:58.472 --> 04:02.341
Guys, we got a 20 on the sedan.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.508
Eddie.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.510
We're gonna get your daughter.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.512

Thank you.

WINNIE:
Guys, subject is 10-96.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.623
Maintain distance.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.725
This is the asshat
that shot Loewen.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.493
Gun it.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.447
That hockey bag he's carrying--

04:25.448 --> 04:27.498
Guns and Gangs think he's
stolen some serious hardware.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.836
Automatic rifles,
shotguns, .45s.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.870
Okay, buckle up.

car horn honking)

05:00.601 --> 05:01.633
(sirens approaching)

05:01.635 --> 05:04.336
You, get inside!

05:04.338 --> 05:06.838
What are you doing?
I said get inside!

05:08.375 --> 05:09.641
(sirens wailing)

05:09.643 --> 05:11.943
Is that a baby?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.480
Get inside.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.915
We got him.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.684
Sunrise Motel.

05:18.686 --> 05:19.885
Winnie, patch me in.

05:19.887 --> 05:20.986
Copy.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.587
Go ahead.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.389
This is Ed Lane with the SRU.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.691
Who am I talking to?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.510
Let me guess.

05:27.511 --> 05:29.328
Now we sit on our asses
until SRU get here.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.563
Subject is armed and dangerous.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.632
Do not approach. Do you copy?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.000
Do we copy?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.501
Do not approach.
Do you copy?

05:36.503 --> 05:39.004
I don't know.
I don't think I heard that.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.706
I think we were already
out of the car. Come on.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.673
Do not approach the subject.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.908
Do you copy?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.844
Do not approach. Do you copy?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.054
He's got the kid inside.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.622
No way
we're stepping down.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.792
We do nothing with
a kid inside?

06:05.065 --> 06:06.665
(baby crying)

06:10.704 --> 06:11.670
What are you doing?

06:11.672 --> 06:12.871
Shut up!

06:12.873 --> 06:14.139
But-but why are you...?

06:14.141 --> 06:16.608
What?! Didn't you hear me, huh?!

06:16.610 --> 06:18.577
Is the baby yours?

06:18.579 --> 06:19.878
That baby is collateral.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.747
What do you mean
collateral?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.415
It means I'm not
going back inside.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.619
It means it's time to go big
or go home, kid.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.820
Please...
Shut up!

06:28.822 --> 06:31.790
Shut up.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.960
Oh, no.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.863
It's okay. It's okay.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.064
Shh, shh.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.088

08:12.125 --> 08:15.927
Greg, we got to get
these guys out of range now.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.031
I knew it, I knew it.
It's Roy.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.132
Eddie...

08:21.134 --> 08:22.234
I'm good.

08:22.236 --> 08:23.902
Shielded extraction.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.569
Wordy, Sam, you're with
me and the boss now.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.507
Let's go.
Spike and Jules, you cover.

08:30.911 --> 08:31.877
Nice and easy.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.049
Get back inside.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.294
ED:
Shotgun?
Yeah.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.229
He's bleeding out.
Manual lift.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.631
Can you do this?
I can handle it.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.733
Let's do it. Let's go.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.067
Go, go, go, go, go.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.606
All right, buddy.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.043
Okay, okay.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.085
ED:
All right, get him down,
get him down.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.321
Jules, give me a pack.
JULES: Yeah, okay.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.325
Check his pulse,
check his pulse.
Yeah.
Medic!

09:20.327 --> 09:22.294
Okay, give me another one,
give me another one
and check his pulse.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.929
What is that?

09:23.931 --> 09:25.564
Coagulates the blood.
JULES:
There's no pulse.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.599
Come on. Come on.
Sam, status?!

09:27.601 --> 09:29.134
The medics

09:29.136 --> 09:30.635
Come on, let them
take over, buddy.
Let them take over.

09:30.637 --> 09:31.670
All right, you got him?

09:34.141 --> 09:35.840
Let's go.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.186
There's a baby in there...
What?!

09:48.188 --> 09:49.910
What's that?
We're supposed
to just wait around?

09:49.911 --> 09:51.633
(engine starting)
You got something
to say here, Roy?

09:51.634 --> 09:53.356
ROY: We didn't hear
any orders...
You had orders to wait.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.594
We didn't hear...
This didn't have to happen.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.362
Huh?

09:57.364 --> 09:58.997
(siren wailing)
He got kids?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.299
Has he got
kids, Roy?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.767
He's your partner.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.002
He's your partner,
tough guy.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.837
You get to make the call.
Go ahead.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.072
Eddie, I need you on the job.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.341
I'm on the job, boss.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.111

We need tac options.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.380

see what we can learn.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.915
Roy? Roy?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.350
Yeah.

10:18.352 --> 10:21.987
Can you see if you can
get us a floor plan?
Yeah.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.955
Boss, I got a number on the room
and an I.D. on the subject.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.290
Thanks, Jules.
SAM:
Hey, boss?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.726
What?
Why is Ed being so
hard on that guy?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.761
It's his brother.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.344
Baby in there.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.980
No CS gas, no live fire.
No provocation.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.383
Two cops down-- this guy's
not looking at much of a future.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.319
Once we get floor plans,
we'll get eyes in on the baby

10:54.321 --> 10:55.387
and make sure it's okay.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.355
It's a she, Wordy.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.691

11:13.040 --> 11:15.173
They want to know
if it's Bruce.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.741
Yeah.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.376
That's more than one voice.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.178
Jules, we may have
a second hostage.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.413
Find out who the room's
registered to.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.881
Is this Bruce DeMaura?

11:22.883 --> 11:23.982
No.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.917
Who am I talking to?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.318
Yeah, that's right.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.887
Yeah, we're gonna talk this out.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.422
Yeah, we're gonna talk
this out, right?

11:30.424 --> 11:32.057
He has lots of guns.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.691
Yeah, yeah, you tell 'em that.
That's good.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.394
YOUNG MAN: I'm really scared.
Voice sounds young.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.696
What's your name, son?

11:37.698 --> 11:38.763
Ben.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.732
Ben, is this your room?

11:40.734 --> 11:42.400
Yes.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.436
Parker initiates contact
with second hostage.

11:44.438 --> 11:45.704
Can you tell me
what happened?

11:45.706 --> 11:47.272
There's a baby in here.
I know.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.340
And we're gonna get you
both out of there.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.408
All right, hang up the phone.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.876
Why don't you let the baby go?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.311
I mean, you got me, right?
I'm your hostage!

11:53.313 --> 11:54.713
You don't need two!
Let her go!

11:54.715 --> 11:57.849
(cocks gun)
I said hang up
the phone!

11:57.851 --> 11:59.751
Line's dead.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.820
JULES:
The room is registered
to a Benjamin Sam.

12:01.822 --> 12:02.854
All right.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.356
(anxious):
No... no...

12:06.927 --> 12:10.895
Ed! Plans.

12:10.897 --> 12:11.963
Thanks, Roy.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.264
Break it down.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.433
Window, screen wall.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.502
Bedroom, bathroom.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.104
Even if we get eyes in...

12:19.106 --> 12:21.206
The front door opens
the wrong way.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.108
Yeah, it blocks the view
of the main room.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.043
We get a camera
under the front door?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.878
The front window leaves us
fully exposed.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.114
If he looks past the curtain.
That's a big if.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.816
Well, if we gotta go in hard,
we gotta keep that kid and baby

12:31.818 --> 12:33.885
out of the line of fire,
meaning we have to know

12:33.887 --> 12:35.787
exactly where they are
at all times.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.324
Let's do it.
Okay.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.997
I picked up two different
cell signals.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.532
The first one's our subject,
Bruce DeMaura.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.801
The second one's
a Paul Wilder.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.302
The name Benjamin Sam
doesn't check out.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.504
It's not in any database.

12:52.506 --> 12:53.538
PARKER:
Thanks, Winnie.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.473
He lied about his name.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.875
Wouldn't be the first time.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.443
Fake name, motel...

12:59.479 --> 13:02.480
Spike, text Paul Wilder
our number.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.983
Jules, you run the name.

13:04.985 --> 13:08.486
Look, how many times do I got
to explain this to you, huh?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.555
I'm not interested
in making any deals, okay!

13:10.557 --> 13:12.157
This ends right here,
right now.
Okay, okay.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.825
Maybe... maybe you can do that,

13:13.827 --> 13:15.293
but you should give them
the baby.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.394
You give them the baby,

13:16.396 --> 13:18.029
then you can do
what you gotta do.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.264
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.300
Yeah, we give 'em the baby,
and they think

13:22.302 --> 13:24.402
I'm making a deal.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.541
JULES:
Paul Wilder, 17 years old.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.009
Father deceased,
lives with his mother

13:31.011 --> 13:32.210
and sister in Parkdale.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.845
It's close.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.046
Yeah. I got his mom en route.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.047
It's five blocks
away.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.448
What's he doing
in a motel

13:37.450 --> 13:39.384
signing under
a fake name?

13:39.385 --> 13:41.319
You live with your mother,
maybe you have a girlfriend,

13:41.321 --> 13:43.021
you need some privacy.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.491
I'm just saying.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.426
Eyes in 60 seconds.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.928
PARKER:
Eddie, hold on.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.530
We got a text from the kid.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.832
Says the baby's coming out.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.266
Hold up.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.434
If he's giving up
the baby,

13:56.436 --> 13:58.870
maybe he's ready
to talk.
Hope so.

14:06.580 --> 14:10.448
Change of plan, Wordy.
Drop the can, cover us.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.295
ED:
That's it.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.465
That's it. Other hand
where we can see it, please.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.003
Eyes on subject.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.238
You see that?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.907
He's got an automatic.
Looks like a .308.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.242
Shield might not take a .308.

14:37.243 --> 14:38.576
I don't like it.
He's dragging us
into the open.

14:38.578 --> 14:42.213
All right, good.
Good. Nice and slow.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.549
That's it.
Just set it down.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.884
(baby fussing)

14:45.886 --> 14:47.652
And back
into the room.

14:47.654 --> 14:51.155
Back into the room,
leave the door open.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.925
We're not gonna do
anything else here, okay?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.593
You get back in here
and you close the door.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.628
We're doing this my way!

14:56.630 --> 14:58.296
Take the baby, quick.
Do it now.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.631
BRUCE:
Get back in here!

14:59.633 --> 15:03.067
Paul, I said get back
in here! Paul, now!

15:04.137 --> 15:05.670
(automatic weapon firing)

15:05.672 --> 15:06.404
(metallic ping)

15:12.078 --> 15:13.444
PARKER:
Eddie, you okay?

15:13.446 --> 15:14.646
I'm good. I'm good.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.614
Armor-piercing rounds.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.083
That's it. The gloves are off.
Jules, get the Arwen.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.485
Spike, you cover.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.520
We're gonna flush 'em out
with flashbangs and CS gas.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.393
It's okay, sweetheart.
You're okay.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.594
It's okay.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.095
He gives us
a fake name,

15:31.097 --> 15:32.397
but that guy
knows who he is?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.399
They know each other.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.648
Gas masks.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.351
Everybody good?
Yeah.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.698
Do you guys hear anything?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.568
That's impossible.
Jules, a couple more.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.676
Okay, masks.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.378
Boss.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.185
Let's do it!
Go! Go! Go! Police!

16:27.187 --> 16:29.120
SRU! Police! Police!

16:29.122 --> 16:31.106
Police!
SRU!

16:31.107 --> 16:33.091
Let's see some hands! Police!
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

16:33.093 --> 16:34.993
We got a subject down!
Subject down!

16:34.995 --> 16:38.997
Paul, you can come out now.
Hands where we can see them!

16:38.999 --> 16:40.665
Bathroom's clear!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.033
Bedroom's clear!

16:42.035 --> 16:44.335
Then where is he?

16:51.244 --> 16:53.411
Guy doesn't just disappear.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.612
He's here someplace.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.314
Let's tear it apart.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.715
Winnie, we need an EMT.

16:57.717 --> 17:01.219
Subject's unconscious.
He's got a serious head wound.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.787
PARKER:
Gunshot?
Blunt trauma.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.155
Where's Paul?

17:04.157 --> 17:05.289
Boss, he's MIA.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.225
Come again?!

17:07.227 --> 17:08.659
He's here somewhere.
We're looking.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.661
Well, look harder!

17:12.365 --> 17:13.698
No joy.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.766
The ceiling?

17:14.768 --> 17:16.167
It's a flat roof.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.168
Bathroom window?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.169
No, it's small,
it's stuck.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.704
There's no way
he went that way.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.172
Well, let's make
like he did.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.175
Get a uniform to confirm
east perimeter secure.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.412
Forget that!
Secure all perimeters!

17:27.414 --> 17:28.813
Spike, get back
to the truck.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.049
Let's get
a chopper out there.
Copy.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.550
Have Roy talk
to the manager again.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.085
Everything he knows

17:34.086 --> 17:35.619
about this motel room
and about Paul Wilder.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.589
And I want to talk
to his mom right away.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.324
ED:
Head wound like that.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.126
Maybe he was pistol-whipped.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.166
I'm Penny Wilder.
Is my son in there?

17:48.168 --> 17:49.600
Hi, Mrs. Wilder.
I'm Sergeant Parker.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.570
I heard guns. What's going on?
Is he all right?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.105
As far as we know, yeah.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.307
They told me he was a-a hostage.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.644
Can you tell me why your son
might have been

17:59.646 --> 18:01.546
at this motel today?

18:01.548 --> 18:02.814
Uh, no.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.491
What's he doing
with all these batteries?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.326
WORDY:
Have a look at this.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.431
Let's get that out
to Spike.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.867
Hip waders?

18:22.869 --> 18:25.269
Whoa-whoa-whoa, guys.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.473
It's a hidden cupboard.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.880
ED:
Okay, Paul, come on out.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.815
Let's go! Paul!

18:39.219 --> 18:40.651
Hold on. Let me get the crowbar.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.937
SAM:
Paul, we're coming in!

18:42.938 --> 18:45.222
If you're there, keep your
hands where we can see them.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.500
(sighs)

18:57.537 --> 19:00.471
Okay, Jules, we got a toolbox,

19:00.473 --> 19:03.741
JULES:
On my way.
we got a computer.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.143
Guys, keep your eyes open.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.377
Mm-hmm.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.217
Toolbox contains cash.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.786
Over a hundred dollars.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.556
Two rolls of duct tape.
flash drive.

19:18.558 --> 19:22.827
We got a map of the city.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.328
A highly annotated map
of the city.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.396
SPIKE:
Let me look?

19:25.398 --> 19:27.398
On its way.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.233
Motel manager says Paul's been
renting here for three weeks.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.501
Cash only.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.768
JULES:
Three weeks.
You got that, boss?

19:31.771 --> 19:32.670
Occasional nights?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.671
JULES:
Occasional?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.439
No, consecutive.
Paid ahead.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.275
Consecutive, paid ahead.

19:37.277 --> 19:40.745
Mrs. Wilder, has Paul been

19:40.747 --> 19:42.747
spending nights
away from home?

19:42.749 --> 19:44.649
Uh, yeah.
He's called a couple of times

19:44.651 --> 19:46.517
to say he was crashing
with a friend.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.453
Was he doing that prior
to these last three weeks?
No.

19:49.455 --> 19:52.190
But that's a good thing because
he's coming out of his shell.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.492
He's quiet.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.693
He's sensitive.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.797
He, um, he really cares
about his studies,

19:59.799 --> 20:01.866
especially if it's
a subject he gets into.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.934
Like what?
Science.

20:02.936 --> 20:05.770
These days, it's, uh,

20:05.772 --> 20:08.773
cities; how they work.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.274
He skipped two grades.

20:10.276 --> 20:12.343
His IQ is 137.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.344
Near genius.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.279
We prefer "gifted."

20:15.281 --> 20:16.981
I prefer "gifted" myself.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.318
Paul have a girlfriend?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.353
No. Why?

20:22.355 --> 20:25.723
We found this in Paul's room.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.525
Do you recognize her?

20:27.527 --> 20:28.826
Uh, no.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.828
I... I'm sorry--
in his room here?

20:30.830 --> 20:35.233
He-he has a-a room here?

20:35.235 --> 20:37.468
I-I don't understand.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.903
He's gone to a lot
of trouble.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.705
And I'm guessing these
aren't bicycle paths.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.240
You see that?

20:42.242 --> 20:43.641
Sunrise Motel.
He's circled it.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.643
It's connected to a blue line.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.678
JULES:
Blue lines are connected
to the streets.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.648
And some of them lead
to the lake.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.883
What's he doing
with all these batteries?

20:52.885 --> 20:55.519
Hip waders?

20:55.521 --> 20:57.288
Batteries and hip waders.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.457
Guys, he's in the sewers.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.492
Those blue lines?

21:01.494 --> 21:02.627
He's marked the sewers.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.661
There's an old access point

21:03.663 --> 21:04.929
under the motel.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.431
Let's go. We're looking
for a trapdoor. Bedroom.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.267
Come on. Give me a hand.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.701
Sam, grab that end.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.938
All right.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.974
We got it. We got it.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.442
You guys ready?
Yep.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.383
Looks clear.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.751
The blue line you're on

21:26.753 --> 21:29.287
it's a storm sewer,
noted beside it "11:30 a.m."

21:29.289 --> 21:31.589
My guess is he's waiting
for a system flush

21:31.591 --> 21:33.724
or a factory flush
before he could go in

21:33.726 --> 21:35.459
'cause we made entry at

21:35.461 --> 21:36.761
11:32.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.329
He played us.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.464
Waiting till
he could get away.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.668
Spike, get squad cars to all
the closest sewer exit points.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.303
We're going in.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.737
Copy.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.539
Paul was in
his motel room

21:48.541 --> 21:49.974
ten minutes ago.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.443
He left through a sewer tunnel,
and he still may be armed.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.078
Do you have any idea
where he would go?

21:54.080 --> 21:56.847
We got five exit points, and
they're all near public places.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.316
You got a library,

21:58.318 --> 21:59.984
you got a mall, a bus
station, a rink,

21:59.986 --> 22:01.986
and a school.
If he knows we're after him,

22:01.988 --> 22:03.454
he's gonna want to get
out of there fast.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.090
Spike, give us the closest
sewer access.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.325
Go right.
You'll be heading north.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.392
Copy.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.731
Hey, boss, Bruce is conscious.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.833
Be right there.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.444
How do you know Paul?

22:26.446 --> 22:27.745
Okay, I just
want you to know,

22:27.747 --> 22:30.414
that cop this morning,
him getting shot,

22:30.416 --> 22:31.649
that was...
that was an accident.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.584
Sure, an accident.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.586
And that kid, you know,
he's been asking around.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.388
Really? About what?
A gun.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.989
And he came to you?
Yeah, yeah.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.725
Paid half up front.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.460
The other half was today.
It was a straight up deal.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.428
You know there are easier ways
to get guns on the streets.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.496
He came to you?

22:45.498 --> 22:46.530
I'm the guy that can get
anything.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.799
What was he looking for?

22:48.801 --> 22:51.535
Pug-nose, .44. Vintage.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.671
Boss, you got to see this.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.508
Paul's looking for a gun
from Bruce.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.111
Bruce shows up at his doorstep
bringing the party with him.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.612
Paul wasn't counting on that.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.448
He was counting on
a pug-nose .44.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.883
The flash drive
from Paul's toolbox.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.685
Photos.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.087
Beheadings, vivisection,

23:10.089 --> 23:12.690
post-gunshot suicide,
etcetera, etcetera.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.393
Here we have biographies.

23:15.395 --> 23:18.896
Gacy, Son of Sam, Dahmer,

23:18.898 --> 23:20.464
Ted Bundy.

23:20.466 --> 23:23.534
These-these are
serial killer profiles.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.903
You know the name Paul
checked under-- Benjamin Sam?

23:25.905 --> 23:27.938
Did you know Ben is
Hebrew for "son of."

23:27.940 --> 23:29.173
Son of Sam?

23:29.175 --> 23:30.875
That's the .44 Killer.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.177
The same gun
Paul was looking for.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.579
There's more.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.617
Five exit points.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.985
Five photos.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.520
Five victims.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.172
Tracey-- that's the girl

23:44.173 --> 23:45.823
in the photo we found
in Paul's room.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.591
Yeah, today was her day.
Still might be.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.193
Team one, listen up.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.096
We may be dealing with a man
with psychopathic tendencies.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.731
Looks like he's been working
on a plan

23:53.733 --> 23:55.666
involving girls
he's been stalking.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.635
Possible abductions at gunpoint.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.904
Taking them back
to a room with privacy.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.440
Okay, there are five possible
places he could be right now.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.008
We just need
to figure out where.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.510
Yeah, if we're not too late.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.554
SAM:
So today's the beginning
of Paul's career

24:16.556 --> 24:18.723
as a serial killer?

24:18.724 --> 24:20.891
These guys take a long time
to plan their first victim,

24:20.893 --> 24:22.660
and he picked
today for a reason.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.228
He's probably going
to stick to it.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.729
Even knowing he's on our radar?

24:25.731 --> 24:27.565
PARKER:
Might not even occur
to him, Eddie.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.000
If he's got a psychopath's ego,

24:30.002 --> 24:31.936
he's thinking
he's outsmarted us.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.472
Yeah, and his brain is
desensitized to the
threat of punishment,

24:34.474 --> 24:36.640
so what just happened
is not going to stop him.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.642
Okay, talk to the mom.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.079
SPIKE:
Those photos of the five girls,

24:42.081 --> 24:44.081
I've cross-referenced them
with the exit points.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.249
Four of them were
taken indoors.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.618
You got a library, school,
bus station.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.570
Only Tracey's is outdoors

24:49.571 --> 24:51.521
and she's carrying something. At
first I thought that was like

24:51.524 --> 24:54.525
a purse or a knapsack,
but now I'm thinking
it's laces. Skate laces.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.160
Skating rink.
SPIKE:
Yeah.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.629
Call them. Confirm any young
women matching that description.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.164
Employees,
skaters taking lessons.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.099
We're looking for someone
who's on a set routine.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.901
She'd be there now.
Copy.

25:03.902 --> 25:05.702
Hey, Winnie, confirm that unis
are set at all five locations.

25:05.705 --> 25:06.737
WINNIE: Copy.
Eddie, change
of plan.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.606
Go to the rink.
What's going on?

25:09.575 --> 25:12.576
Penny, we need to talk.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.714
Which way do we go?

25:16.716 --> 25:18.916
Spike, we're at
a junction here.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.952
Which way are we going?
You're going
to want to go left.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.721
Left.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.561
JULES:
<i> Is your son</i>
<i> an empathetic person?</i>

25:30.563 --> 25:32.096
Empathetic?
Yes, if someone
is harmed

25:32.098 --> 25:34.198
or in distress,
does he feel for them?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.701
He doesn't really, um,
respond like other people.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.803
But you just have to know him.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.739
JULES:
How did he respond

25:41.741 --> 25:42.773
when your husband died?

25:43.743 --> 25:47.077
He-he, uh, he didn't.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.079
Does your son
take pleasure

25:49.081 --> 25:50.681
in hurting people?

25:50.683 --> 25:53.584
What? No, God.
Wh-what are you saying?

25:53.586 --> 25:55.786
If anything, people take
pleasure in hurting him

25:55.788 --> 25:57.321
and picking on him.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.657
He's always been the smallest,
the youngest,

25:59.659 --> 26:01.209
the smartest in his class.

26:01.210 --> 26:02.760
I-I don't understand--
why are you asking me this?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.194
We think that
your son

26:04.196 --> 26:06.130
might have psychopathic
tendencies.
I'm sorry? What?

26:06.132 --> 26:08.132
Has he ever been
rejected by a woman

26:08.134 --> 26:10.067
with red shoulder-length hair?

26:11.304 --> 26:12.603
Excuse us a second.

26:12.605 --> 26:13.837
Jules, come on.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.847
You're pushing too hard.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.116
We don't have time
for kid gloves.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.318
You saw what was in the toolbox.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.153
I know,
but you can't shut her down.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.688
He worships serial killers.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.356
Or he studies
serial killers.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.024
Come on, classic Bundy.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.694
He stalks girls that look
like the one that rejected him.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.829
Jules, he's 17. We can't
jump to that conclusion.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.799
Plus, we got to keep her trust
if we're gonna get to the truth.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.367
Okay.
So you go
to the house.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.902
Do an environmental
profile.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.770
I'll keep talking
to the mom.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.807
If this comes to a showdown,
we need to know everything.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.681
Listen to me.
Please, I know my boy.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.383
I know he's different,
he's special,

26:59.385 --> 27:01.685
but there's no way
he's a psychopath.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.320
Sit.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.862
We're not here
to judge your son.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.131
We just want to figure
out how we can help him.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.700
Can you help me do that?

27:17.703 --> 27:19.269
Thank you.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.738
Found some photos

27:20.740 --> 27:22.072
on Paul's computer.

27:27.847 --> 27:28.946
Oh, my God.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.147
Penny?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.949
When you showed me
that girl before,

27:31.951 --> 27:35.219
I didn't see it, but look
at them-- all five of them.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.820
You know them?

27:36.822 --> 27:38.956
Franny.
They all look like Franny.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.758
His sister.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.828
(siren wailing)

27:44.830 --> 27:47.665
JULES:
<i> Ed, if you're first contact,</i>

27:47.667 --> 27:49.066
you're going to need
to negotiate.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.301
So we're talking down
a psychopath?

27:51.303 --> 27:53.203
A youth with possible

27:53.205 --> 27:55.706
psychopathic tendencies,
until we get more information.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.275
Copy that.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.244
PENNY:
He loved Franny
when she was a baby.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.745
He took care of her.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.747
She was the whole world
to him.

28:03.749 --> 28:04.948
PARKER:
But when she
got older?

28:04.950 --> 28:07.751
She got more independent, and...
(sniffs)

28:07.753 --> 28:09.887
she wasn't his anymore.

28:09.889 --> 28:14.224
And-and then one day she told
him she thought he was scary.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.727
He had a hard time
with that.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.062
I mean, it's hard.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.330
He's awkward, he's reclusive.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.766
Even he knows he doesn't
get people.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.703
He knows that?
Yeah, oh, yeah.

28:25.705 --> 28:28.472
I do my best to be a bridge
between them, but...

28:30.142 --> 28:32.276
Why can't I be with my friends
without you acting like a freak?

28:32.278 --> 28:34.712
I've dealt with it
my whole life and you hear me,

28:34.714 --> 28:36.847
it's over! It's over!

28:36.848 --> 28:38.981
I never want to see you
sick freak face again!

28:42.188 --> 28:44.154
(screaming)

28:47.326 --> 28:49.326
(screams)

28:50.930 --> 28:53.063
(door slams shut)

28:54.233 --> 28:57.868
It... it was just last year.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.504
He went through every
family photo in the house.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.440
He cut Franny's face out
of all of them.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.778
<i> He threw all of her things</i>
<i> out a window.</i>

29:07.780 --> 29:09.780
<i> He said he wanted her</i>
<i> to just, to...</i>

29:09.782 --> 29:12.916
<i> to go, to disappear.</i>

29:12.918 --> 29:14.885
What did you do?

29:14.887 --> 29:17.321
I made him promise
never to hurt his sister.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.790
I said, "Do it for me.
Do it for my sake.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.458
Never touch..."

29:24.396 --> 29:26.897
Oh, my God.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.802
He's keeping his promise
to me. He's...

29:39.945 --> 29:41.411
He's going after
these girls

29:41.413 --> 29:42.980
instead of Franny!

29:42.982 --> 29:46.283
<i>Oh, God, this is because of me!</i>

29:46.285 --> 29:47.451
(sobbing)
This is my fault!

29:50.389 --> 29:52.456
(grunting)

30:03.969 --> 30:06.069
Ed, exit point's on
your left-hand side.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.933
(girl talking indistinctly)

30:37.837 --> 30:39.436
(laughs)

30:40.406 --> 30:42.573
Okay, Sam.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.109
Tracey?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.013
Hi.

30:50.015 --> 30:50.981
Hi.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.550
It's Paul.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.486
Oh, I'm sorry. Do I know you?

30:56.488 --> 30:58.222
Last week, remember?

30:58.224 --> 31:00.524
We talked about
how cold it was.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.892
It was cold and...

31:01.894 --> 31:05.562
Um... you know?

31:05.564 --> 31:07.264
Right, yeah.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.149
I need you to come with me.

31:09.150 --> 31:11.033
I'm sorry, I actually
have a lesson that
I have to get to, so...

31:11.036 --> 31:13.503
No, no, you've got
to come with me.
Let go of me.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.272
I have a gun.
What?!

31:15.274 --> 31:16.440
Boss, we've got him
at the rink.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.075
Keep quiet.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.610
Help!
Stay back!

31:26.218 --> 31:27.651
(people clamoring)
ED:
Paul!

31:27.653 --> 31:29.486
My name's Ed Lane.
I'm with the SRU.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.055
Paul!

31:32.057 --> 31:33.257
My name's Ed Lane.
I'm with the SRU.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.559
I need you to lower

31:35.561 --> 31:36.894
that gun, son.

31:36.896 --> 31:37.895
Leave me alone!

31:37.897 --> 31:40.063
In position.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.615
Okay, here we go.

31:41.616 --> 31:43.166
She said he's serious
about his studies,

31:43.168 --> 31:45.102
especially when it's a subject
he gets into.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.670
Like the sewers,
like her sister.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.139
<i> Intense fixated interests.</i>

31:49.141 --> 31:51.008
He prefers to be alone.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.110
She says he knows
he doesn't get people.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.178
And a psychopath would think
that he does get people,

31:55.180 --> 31:56.480
and that he's
smarter than them.

31:56.482 --> 31:57.581
Hey, boss,
I'm in Paul's bedroom.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.416
How's it look?

31:59.417 --> 32:01.250
Orderly would be
an understatement.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.586
That's very good. What else?

32:02.588 --> 32:04.688
There's a photo essay.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.124
Like he's been studying
human emotions, behaviors.

32:07.126 --> 32:10.177
What do you see, Jules?

32:10.178 --> 32:13.229
Facial expressions, gestures,
body language.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.968
Jules, those captions,
what do they say?

32:17.970 --> 32:19.236
"You are angry.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.370
"You are bored.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.172
You are happy to see me."

32:22.174 --> 32:25.375
Sounds like he's trying to
learn how to read people.

32:25.377 --> 32:28.211
That's odd. Psychopaths--
they know how to do that.

32:28.213 --> 32:29.212
What are you thinking?

32:29.214 --> 32:31.131
Look, I'm not ruling out

32:31.132 --> 32:33.049
that he has tendencies,
but we might be dealing with

32:33.052 --> 32:34.952
some undiagnosed,
high-functioning autism.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.219
Like, Asperger's syndrome?

32:36.221 --> 32:38.088
People with Asperger's--
they're not violent.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.122
I know that.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.224
There's a lot more at play here,

32:41.226 --> 32:42.426
but it's a place to start.

32:42.428 --> 32:46.563
January 23, that's today.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.632
Guys, it's Franny's birthday.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.500
That's why he picked today.

32:52.071 --> 32:55.238
ED:
We're just here
to help you, buddy.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.373
(Tracey gasping)
Okay?

32:56.375 --> 32:58.642
Look, Paul, your...

32:58.644 --> 33:00.143
your mom tells me

33:00.145 --> 33:01.578
that you're a,
you're a real bright kid.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.981
So, can you, can you
just help us out here?

33:03.983 --> 33:05.716
Look, I don't want
to talk to you!

33:05.718 --> 33:07.317
Please, Paul, let me go.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.987
JULES:
<i>He kept one photo of his sister</i>

33:09.989 --> 33:11.388
and he didn't cut her out.

33:11.390 --> 33:12.456
It was him and Franny.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.457
She a baby?

33:13.459 --> 33:15.025
Yeah, I think she was turning

33:15.027 --> 33:16.159
about three.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.261
But I thought
they didn't get along.

33:18.263 --> 33:21.098
Yeah, well, he kept it because
they did have a bond back then.

33:21.100 --> 33:25.068
She never rejected him,
she never, she never judged him

33:25.070 --> 33:26.336
till she got older.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.604
That's when he got angry.

33:27.606 --> 33:30.273
Boss, but the serial killers,
the death pictures,

33:30.275 --> 33:32.142
the five girls
that look like her.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.712
Look, maybe he's just trying to
understand why he's different.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.614
Why he's alone.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.216
I mean, he's done his research.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.250
He thinks he's a psychopath,

33:40.252 --> 33:42.052
so he's doing it by the book.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.286
If that's the case, we got

33:43.288 --> 33:45.455
to make him look deeper
than that.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.506
Status, Eddie?

34:02.508 --> 34:05.208
Boss, he's agitated,
he's unresponsive.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.044
He's focused in.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.211
He's threat yellow.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.280
I'm going to try a new angle.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.281
PARKER:
Hey, Paul,

34:11.283 --> 34:12.382
(Tracey whimpers)

34:12.384 --> 34:15.152
How you doing?

34:15.154 --> 34:17.621
Sergeant Parker.
(siren wails)

34:17.623 --> 34:21.258
We talked on the phone
at the motel, remember?

34:21.260 --> 34:22.392
Nobody is listening to me.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.694
I don't want to talk!
(whimpers)

34:24.696 --> 34:26.696
Okay, I'll talk then.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.765
Okay, okay.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.951
Paul!

34:30.952 --> 34:33.136
You did something
really brave today.

34:33.138 --> 34:35.305
You did something really great.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.673
Do you know what that was?

34:37.643 --> 34:39.776
No.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.145
You helped
a little baby.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.615
And you kept her safe.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.651
Like you kept Franny safe.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.553
Don't talk to me about Franny!

34:49.555 --> 34:52.722
Okay, okay,
we don't have to.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.258
But I just
want you to know

34:55.260 --> 34:57.494
that those... those people
that you been studying...

34:57.496 --> 34:59.429
I mean, let's call them
what they are;

34:59.431 --> 35:00.564
those killers.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.632
Killers.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.868
They wouldn't have,

35:04.870 --> 35:07.637
they wouldn't have helped
that baby today.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.474
And Bruce--
you could have shot Bruce,

35:10.476 --> 35:11.741
you could have crossed
that line,

35:11.743 --> 35:13.176
but you didn't
do that either.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.779
You made the choice
to not hurt him.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.180
Those killers?

35:17.182 --> 35:19.382
They wouldn't have made
that choice.

35:19.384 --> 35:20.417
You're not like them.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.751
No, you don't know me.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.653
You're right. I don't know
everything about you,

35:23.655 --> 35:26.156
but I do know
that you work really hard

35:26.158 --> 35:27.324
to understand yourself.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.358
I understand myself.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.293
I know what I am!

35:30.295 --> 35:33.130
It is the other people!

35:33.132 --> 35:35.165
I know.

35:35.166 --> 35:37.199
I know you like order,
you like routine.

35:37.202 --> 35:40.537
It's stressful to be around
all these people,

35:40.539 --> 35:41.838
but it's peaceful.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.308
It's peaceful to just focus
on just one thing

35:45.310 --> 35:47.344
that matters to you, right?

35:47.346 --> 35:50.447
Like stuff at school.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.781
Like the sewers.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.717
Like your baby sister.

35:55.587 --> 35:56.920
She hates me.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.321
Nah,
she's scared of you

35:58.323 --> 36:01.324
because she didn't
understand you.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.860
But you and I,
we could help her out with that.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.530
'Cause I'm thinking you might
have this condition.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.366
If I'm right,

36:09.368 --> 36:11.418
there are a lot of people

36:11.419 --> 36:13.469
who are gonna know exactly
what you're going through,

36:13.472 --> 36:15.438
and I'll help you
find them.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.843
Well, how do I know
you're not lying?

36:19.845 --> 36:21.745
You think
I'm lying to you?

36:21.747 --> 36:23.613
I don't know. I don't...

36:23.615 --> 36:25.448
What do you,
what do you think lying means?

36:25.450 --> 36:26.616
What does that mean to you?

36:26.618 --> 36:27.784
Saying a false
statement,

36:27.786 --> 36:30.453
deceiving or giving
a wrong impression.

36:30.455 --> 36:32.822
Okay, so let me ask you
something different.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.860
You think I'm listening to you?

36:44.736 --> 36:46.836
(sighs)
I don't want to hurt her.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.538
I know that.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.974
I don't...
I don't want to hurt her.
I know.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.643
I know. I knew that the minute
we started talking.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.915
Do you want me
to give the gun to you?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.483
If that's what you want.

37:00.485 --> 37:03.253
Or you can just put it down
on the ground.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.289
(Tracey sobs)

37:06.291 --> 37:07.991
Okay, okay.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.459
Stay where you are, Paul.
No one's gonna hurt you.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.427
No one's gonna hurt you.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.529
(handcuffs clicking)
Yeah.

37:12.531 --> 37:13.330
It's okay, son.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.569
Oh, God! (sobbing)

37:25.877 --> 37:28.511
What's wrong with me?
Why didn't I see this?

37:28.513 --> 37:30.513
Penny, you can't
blame yourself,
all right?

37:30.515 --> 37:32.549
You thought that your
son was different,

37:32.551 --> 37:33.883
you thought he
was special.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.019
And he is.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.887
Yeah, I should have
done something.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.789
You did. You loved him.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.993
And you cannot
stop doing that.

37:42.995 --> 37:44.594
He's gonna need help.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.497
There's therapy,
there's medication.

37:47.499 --> 37:50.667
Most of all,
he's gonna need you.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.906
Go ahead.

38:05.751 --> 38:06.916
I'm sorry.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.351
No, I'm sorry.

38:08.353 --> 38:09.919
I love you.

38:09.921 --> 38:13.690
(sobs)

38:13.692 --> 38:15.592
Let's go, son.

38:15.594 --> 38:16.626
Come on.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.695
Sorry, ma'am.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.865
It's okay, ma'am.
It's okay.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.338
(keyboard clacking)

38:32.911 --> 38:34.744
Ed.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.347
Yeah?

38:37.349 --> 38:38.815
We got that baby safe.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.585
And you want me to back you up.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.554
The call not to
approach the motel--

38:44.556 --> 38:46.790
I didn't hear you
on the radio.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.327
You didn't?

38:52.864 --> 38:55.498
We were doing
the best that we could.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.668
A cop was shot.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.570
We thought there was
a baby in there.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.606
I know. Look, I just don't have
the time right now.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.878
Never did.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.854
Undiagnosed
low-spectrum autism,

39:17.856 --> 39:21.424
a little
obsessive-compulsive...

39:21.426 --> 39:24.561
Maybe a borderline personality
disorder.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.397
And a mother who only sees
the son she loves.

39:27.399 --> 39:30.133
He's brilliant but different.

39:32.437 --> 39:34.437
You ever get the feeling

39:34.439 --> 39:36.873
we only get
to scratch the surface?

39:36.875 --> 39:38.742
Hmm, all the time.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.045
(sighs)

39:42.047 --> 39:43.880
You know, you were right
today, though,

39:43.882 --> 39:45.115
about digging deeper.

39:47.152 --> 39:51.054
We do what we can
with the time we have, right?

39:51.056 --> 39:52.622
Yep.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.692
¶ Cut my skin and I bleed ¶

39:55.694 --> 39:59.696
¶ Just like anybody ¶

39:59.698 --> 40:02.565
¶ And I want and I need ¶

40:02.567 --> 40:05.468
¶ As much as anybody ¶

40:05.470 --> 40:09.406
¶ Sometimes I cry ¶

40:09.408 --> 40:13.643

40:19.718 --> 40:23.720
¶ I have secrets, I have scars ¶

40:23.722 --> 40:26.623
¶ As deep as anybody ¶

40:26.625 --> 40:29.092
¶ I have fears no one hears ¶

40:29.094 --> 40:31.060
Baby.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.596
¶ But don't tell anybody ¶

40:33.598 --> 40:37.434
¶ Sometimes I lie ¶

40:37.436 --> 40:38.768
¶ But doesn't everybody ¶

40:38.770 --> 40:41.771
(whispers):
I really needed you today.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.606
I'm sorry.

40:43.608 --> 40:47.010
¶ Sometimes
doesn't everybody. ¶
