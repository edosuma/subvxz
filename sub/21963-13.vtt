WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.753
Oh, my G...

00:19.787 --> 00:21.855
What is tha... Ah.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.057
Who would have done this?

00:23.091 --> 00:24.192
MERV:
I am taking over

00:24.225 --> 00:25.526
as director of this department.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.994
We won't be doing
an investigation.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.662
The wire passed through here.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.499
I'm also getting
a very strong sense

00:31.532 --> 00:32.733
of grain.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.335
They're telling me, "Isabelle."

00:34.368 --> 00:36.437
I know who bugged our office.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.038
And I thought saying something
like that would prove

00:38.072 --> 00:40.408
that I'm not a racist.
Or a sexist.

00:40.441 --> 00:44.212
But my kid's principal got
all offended, so what do I know?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.116
Oh, I know who bugged
the office.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.218
What?

00:50.251 --> 00:51.752
Yeah, yeah, last night,
I pieced it all together.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.187
:
Okay, well

00:53.221 --> 00:55.589
So the psychic said
"wheat" and "Isabelle."

00:55.623 --> 00:57.091
Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.427
So I see a field of wheat
on a bag of chips.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.963
Those chips were made
by S.A. Belle Foods.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.965
-S.A. Belle.
: Isabelle.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.567
Isabelle. That's right.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.869
And then I realized that
that new vending machine

01:08.902 --> 01:13.474
we've had for a few months,
it was dropped off by S...

01:13.507 --> 01:15.709
-S.A. Belle Foods.
-Yes, and

01:15.743 --> 01:17.911
it was delivered by three dudes.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.414
-Three guys

01:20.448 --> 01:22.650
for a one-guy-and-a-hand-truck
job?

01:22.683 --> 01:25.553
Suspicious.

01:25.586 --> 01:29.423
I cannot believe that you waited
12 hours to tell me this.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.759
This is the kind of thing
you-you wake me up

01:31.792 --> 01:33.294
in the middle of the night with.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.896
You could just be happy
he's telling you now.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.265
"When" is not the headline here.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.333
Next time, maybe,

01:39.367 --> 01:40.568
-you should tell her sooner.
-Oh, yeah.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.002
I shouldn't have waited.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.304
In fact, I was gonna
call you this morning,

01:43.337 --> 01:44.838
but then I got another call.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.341
It was my high school orchestra
asking for money.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.009
They got invited
to play in Prague.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.278
-No way.
-Mm-hmm.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.112
And then I went
to the gym, and...

01:52.146 --> 01:53.781
Anyway, sorry.

01:53.814 --> 01:57.251
Why would Belle Foods bug us?

01:57.285 --> 01:59.119
LEROY: We figured out
who owns the company.

01:59.153 --> 02:00.821
Kenneth Lanier.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.191
Yeah, I don't know who that is.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.625
The same dude who funded

02:04.658 --> 02:07.595
the Audience Award
runner-up documentary

02:07.628 --> 02:10.030
at last year's
Nevada Film Festival,

02:10.063 --> 02:11.865
They Came from Space.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.867
Which was nearly unwatchable.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.669
It had, like, three endings.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.171
Okay.
This could be our guy.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.173
LEROY:
Yeah. Okay, so we go to Merv...

02:19.207 --> 02:20.941
No. No. No, we don't go to Merv.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.810
-No Merv.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.646
We simply cannot trust Merv.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.781
Okay? He could be part
of this whole thing.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.782
MAX:
Well, yeah, but...

02:28.816 --> 02:30.184
-I mean, he's...
-No. No.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.385
Not Merv.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.520
Never Merv. Okay?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.555
Do not trust Merv.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.689
Trust me.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.890
Trust Ava.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.127
Ava. Ava. Ava.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.162
Got it?

02:43.231 --> 02:45.399
What are you guys talking about?

02:45.433 --> 02:47.435
*

02:51.505 --> 02:53.307
ANNIE: "What was long a rumor
has now been verified:

02:53.341 --> 02:55.876
"the U.S. government has spent
tens of millions a year

02:55.909 --> 03:00.381
"for over six decades
on a 'black money' program

03:00.414 --> 03:03.150
researching ESP,
aliens and ghosts."

03:03.183 --> 03:05.152
MAX: All right, when you read it
out loud like that,

03:05.185 --> 03:07.521
it really does sound like
a dumb thing to spend money on.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.690
Like, even I'm angry
at our government.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.891
They're gonna slash our budget.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.693
Oh. Well, this is really bad.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.328
They outed our building.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.563
There's a map.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.598
And an arrow.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.500
And a picture of the place,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.369
and I don't think
they needed that arrow.

03:21.402 --> 03:25.373
Well, we are about to become
a giant magnet for lunatics.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.443
Was it you?

03:29.477 --> 03:32.079
What?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.681
No. Is that why I'm here?

03:33.714 --> 03:38.018
Look, one of those bozos
did talk to The Times.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.388
And I want you to find out
which bozo

03:40.421 --> 03:44.024
went flapping his big
stupid painted clown face.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.426
Me?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.261
-Yeah.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.862
Look, Washington wants
to find out

03:48.896 --> 03:51.265
if the leak came
from inside this bureau.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.734
And it's my job
to do that investigation.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.135
But not do it.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.770
That, I'm giving to you.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.907
I'd love to, but you know
who would kill at this?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.609
-Sasha.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.444
I don't know if you know this,
but all she does all day

04:03.477 --> 04:05.212
is make microwave popcorn.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.081
Constantly with the popping--
pop, pop, pop, pop.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.550
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

04:09.583 --> 04:10.951
-pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop...
-But hey-hey...

04:10.984 --> 04:12.586
Unfortunately I-I-I...

04:12.620 --> 04:15.122
I don't know anyone else
I can trust here.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.425
Okay? I mean,
you're my right hand.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.828
I'm left-handed, so, sorry.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.430
I don't care.

04:22.463 --> 04:25.399
I just need you to handle
all of that unpleasant

04:25.433 --> 04:26.967
and super boring stuff

04:27.000 --> 04:29.069
that my-my real hands
don't want to handle.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.539
-Merv.
-You have 48 hours.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.242
But, you know,

04:35.275 --> 04:38.245
if you finish early
or you need a couple extra days,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.381
doesn't matter.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.117
Oh, no.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.253
You were right, Annie.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.622
Not even 24 hours,
and here come the freaks.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.857
MAX:
Oh, yeah?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.664
Those are my parents.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.499
-GLORIA: Oh, look at this.
-Oh, yeah.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.868
So, anyway,
that's when Bernard said,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.136
you were in The New York Times.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.607
Field agent for a secret
government agency.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.209
It's fun. It's exciting,
uh, it's exciting work.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.011
Yeah, well, uh,
we had to come see.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.212
-Mm-hmm.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.847
Yeah, I wish you had told me

05:13.881 --> 05:15.649
that, uh, that you were coming.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.318
The thing is, is that just
because it was in the paper,

05:18.352 --> 05:20.153
doesn't mean
it's open to the public.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.489
We're not the public.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.290
-No...
-We're your family.
-No, no, no.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.792
No, no, no, no, I know.
It's just that there's, like,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.794
sensitive information
all around.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.429
So...

05:29.763 --> 05:33.534
Well, w-we drove
such a long way.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.436
Can we?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.338
MAX:
Hey, everyone,

05:38.372 --> 05:40.841
-I'd like you
to meet my parents.
-Oh.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.810
This is, uh, very important.
This is my partner.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.745
Uh, let's call him L.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.414
For Leroy.
Nice to meet you.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.716
Nice to meet you too, Elroy.

05:48.749 --> 05:52.219
Well, that's quite a handshake
you have there.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.823
Uh, do you, uh,
ever play ball, Elroy?

05:55.856 --> 05:58.692
I don't, but I do have one of
those squeezy things in my car.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.893
Ooh, uh, okay,

05:59.927 --> 06:02.029
so here is A,

06:02.062 --> 06:04.264
and, uh, and-and-and B.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.399
-Oh...
-A.
-Say hello.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.834
-Okay, um...
-Oh.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.502
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.203
Now, what a pleasure
to meet you.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.338
Come in for a cuddle. Come on.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.240
-Oh!
-There you are. Oh.

06:13.273 --> 06:16.343
Oh, gosh, he sounds
just like Pierce Brosnan.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.245
Excuse me, um...

06:18.278 --> 06:21.081
Did someone schedule
an execution for today

06:21.114 --> 06:23.216
and forget
to have me authorize it?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.618
MAX:
No, no, no, no.

06:24.652 --> 06:27.354
Uh, Boss,
who shall remain nameless

06:27.387 --> 06:29.757
as to protect his identity,
these are my parents.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.060
This is Herman Jennifer
and Gloria Stevens-Jennifer.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.695
-This is Boss.
-HERMAN: Hi.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.964
Max, take-take
the blindfolds off.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.265
Really?
All right.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.800
Well, I guess we're...

06:39.833 --> 06:42.235
-gonna take these off, then.
-Oh, good.

06:42.269 --> 06:46.239
Now, if you end up getting
executed, don't blame me.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.075
-Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.
-Oh, I'm joking,
I'm joking, guys.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.210
-GLORIA: Of course you are.
-HERMAN: Hey, Max, um...

06:50.243 --> 06:53.146
is there someplace we could go,
a little more private,

06:53.180 --> 06:56.116
that we could talk?

06:56.149 --> 06:58.552
: Are you still
listening to us, you bastard?

06:58.586 --> 07:00.053
I hope so.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.055
Because now I'm watching you.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.457
And I'm going to find you,

07:03.491 --> 07:05.292
and you are going
to tell me the truth,

07:05.325 --> 07:08.328
even if I have to bite it
out of you.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.167
Hey, um...

07:14.201 --> 07:16.770
how do you think
this leak got out?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.772
Oh, I don't know.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.609
I mean, the whole place
was bugged.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.810
True that.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.778
That's a good point.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.648
Yeah.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.651
You never got approached
by anyone, like...

07:30.684 --> 07:32.853
...to...

07:32.886 --> 07:34.688
Um, why are you
asking me like that?

07:34.722 --> 07:35.856
Are you questioning me?

07:38.158 --> 07:41.128
Look, Merv...

07:41.161 --> 07:43.531
okay, wants me to find out

07:43.564 --> 07:45.766
if the leak came from inside.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.268
And you refused...

07:48.301 --> 07:49.803
Yes, of course.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.005
Kind of.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.341
But then he went
full Merv on me.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.676
-Oh...
-Full.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.310
God, yeah. Full Merv.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.446
-Thank you. Yes.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.217
-Hey, everyone...

08:04.251 --> 08:06.453
Leroy's conducting
an investigation

08:06.486 --> 08:08.789
and would like
to secretly interrogate you

08:08.822 --> 08:09.957
without your consent
or knowledge.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.392
-LEROY: No.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.362
-No. No. It's not like that.
-BARRY: Oh, my God.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.498
I'm simply asking,
not investigating,

08:18.532 --> 08:22.202
if anyone had any contact with,
say, a reporter from The Times?

08:22.235 --> 08:24.638
If the answer's no,
just say no.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.740
-Is this statement
on the record?

08:26.774 --> 08:28.341
Would you write down
our answers?

08:28.375 --> 08:30.243
Eventually I will
write something down.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.311
I'm not gonna sing my report.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.546
How could you be such a traitor?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.181
Traitor? No, no, not a traitor.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.183
Everybody just relax.
I didn't want this job.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.151
Uh, that's what Hitler said.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.720
Look, I'm not a history expert,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.354
but I don't think
that's what Hitler said.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.191
I think he made it very clear
he did want the job.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.726
He said it in parades,

08:45.759 --> 08:48.095
on the radio, in beer halls...

08:48.128 --> 08:50.430
Look, I just want to know

08:50.463 --> 08:52.766
if anybody talked to the press.
That's it.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.740
Wow.
Okay, uh...

08:59.773 --> 09:02.042
maybe one-on-one chitchats

09:02.075 --> 09:03.711
would be better for people?

09:03.744 --> 09:06.346
Yeah, you got that right,
Mussolini.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.448
Who taught you
about World War II?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.689
BIRD:
Oh, no.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.557
How many parents does Max have?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.794
-HERMAN: It looks very...
-GLORIA: Is it a spider

09:20.828 --> 09:22.229
or a stereo unit?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.731
HERMAN:
I don't know, looks important.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.633
-Or maybe a car or...
-No.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.901
-There you go, guys.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.770
-Oh. Oh, thank you.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.204
-No, we got a bunch of those
in the kitchen, yeah.
-Oh.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.405
-Yeah, it's not a big deal.
-Great.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.374
So

09:34.407 --> 09:36.209
-Pretty cool.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.811
You should be here when...
when we're working on a case.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.780
It's chaos. I... It's-it's...

09:39.813 --> 09:41.548
Yeah, well, um...

09:41.581 --> 09:43.216
-Let me ask you,

09:43.250 --> 09:47.087
uh, where do you think all
of this is, uh, leading?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.555
Yeah, sure.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.257
I like to think of it
like the future...

09:50.290 --> 09:51.892
-GLORIA: Mm-hmm.
-Oh.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.662
...being more investigations,
more discoveries, right?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.563
Just expanding
our-our general understanding,

09:56.596 --> 09:57.765
if that makes sense?

09:57.798 --> 09:58.999
Yeah, well, well, I...

09:59.032 --> 10:00.768
I was thinking more
professionally.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.135
-Uh-huh.
-I mean...

10:02.169 --> 10:05.405
where does a job
like this take you?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.907
-Sure.
-GLORIA: Yeah, you know, like,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.742
is this, like, a stepping stone

10:08.776 --> 10:12.245
to something that's really
prestigious, like, um...

10:12.279 --> 10:13.580
NASA?

10:13.613 --> 10:14.648
-Amazon.
-GLORIA: Oh, boy.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.849
-MAX: Right.
-Uh-huh.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.417
I mean, first of all,

10:17.450 --> 10:20.253
NASA is not as prestigious
as you think,

10:20.287 --> 10:23.290
and Amazon, it's just... it has
nothing to do with science.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.492
Well, computers.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.661
-Yeah, but just to order stuff.
-Look, um,

10:27.695 --> 10:30.798
we're not trying
to tell you what to do,

10:30.831 --> 10:32.532
we just want to understand.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.201
I mean, you...

10:34.234 --> 10:37.104
-you graduated top
in your class.
-GLORIA: Mm-hmm.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.441
Oh, and you represented Peru
in the Model U.N.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.843
Oh, yeah, you know, during

10:42.876 --> 10:44.678
a very difficult time
with the country.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.113
Yeah, they were having
economic problems.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.647
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-I solved it.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.951
And then working for
a wire hanger company...

10:50.984 --> 10:54.387
we said, okay, uh,

10:54.421 --> 10:57.057
you know, one day
he could, uh...

10:57.090 --> 10:59.192
become manager.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.728
But now that you find out
that I'm working

11:00.761 --> 11:03.496
at the frontier of science,
you have issues?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.799
I mean, how much longer
do you think the government's

11:05.833 --> 11:08.135
gonna pay you to go around

11:08.168 --> 11:10.570
chasing ghosts and robots?

11:10.603 --> 11:12.039
We don't chase robots.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.373
Honey, don't get defensive.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.343
We just don't want you
to wake up

11:16.376 --> 11:18.345
when you're 40

11:18.378 --> 11:22.249
and realize that you have
devoted your entire life

11:22.282 --> 11:24.818
to what turns out to be

11:24.852 --> 11:27.054
a big waste of time.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.656
I'm 42.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.791
Well...

11:32.592 --> 11:35.228
Bird, got a minute?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.998
-Yeah...
-Just tell me you did not talk
to The New York Times.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.232
But what if I did?

11:39.266 --> 11:41.668
Still tell me you didn't.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.871
I feel very safe talking to you.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.272
Like I can tell you anything.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.540
Do you want me to tell you

11:47.574 --> 11:49.242
about the worst thing
that I've ever done?

11:49.276 --> 11:50.677
I beg you not to.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.413
It's a long story,
so just relax.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.083
-Uh, I was raised
by my grandparents.
-Bird...

11:56.116 --> 11:58.385
Neither one of them
believed in monogamy.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.253
Oh, no.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.559
Oh, they got enough people
to turn over a car now.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.398
Merv. Uh, hi.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.233
I, uh, wanted to see you.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.635
Ava. Um, sorry
I haven't responded

12:15.668 --> 12:17.304
to your multiple requests,

12:17.337 --> 12:19.372
but I thought
you would just figure out

12:19.406 --> 12:21.308
that I wasn't going
to get back to you.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.377
Look, Merv, I know
that we're in the middle

12:24.411 --> 12:26.379
-of a difficult moment here...
-Yes.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.116
...but I would like
to take some personal time.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.751
I think that's a great idea.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.820
You do?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.421
Yeah. I mean...

12:34.454 --> 12:35.789
you know, you've been
through a lot lately.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.792
So I think, you know,
taking a few days or maybe--

12:38.826 --> 12:42.429
hell, a few weeks--
that would be good for you.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.097
Good for me?
Uh...

12:44.131 --> 12:45.265
what does that mean?

12:45.298 --> 12:46.733
Well, because.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.468
I mean, you do mean...

12:48.501 --> 12:52.072
that you're-you're gonna
check into, you know, a...

12:52.105 --> 12:54.842
a mental health garden spa

12:54.875 --> 12:56.409
facility type thing?

12:59.646 --> 13:00.613
What?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.349
Oh, all right.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.585
Honestly, just...
just go wherever,

13:05.618 --> 13:07.821
and-and tap on my window
when you get back.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.656
Okay?

13:09.689 --> 13:12.259
Wow. There are...
there are a few more of 'em.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.661
Okay. Just don't
make any eye contact,

13:14.694 --> 13:16.629
head straight for the Saab,
you should be fine.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.199
Okay, Max.
Um, can we say something?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.101
Your brother Daniel...

13:21.134 --> 13:22.836
Oh, here we go, okay.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.771
It is not shameful
to ask for help.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.274
Benjamin Franklin had help.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.876
Are you talking about slaves?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.810
Max, don't dredge up the past.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.880
You guys, listen.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.347
I don't want to work for

13:34.381 --> 13:35.949
Daniel's energy bar
delivery service.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.985
-Oh...
-He has a very

13:38.018 --> 13:39.486
successful company.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.688
And I don't see what would hurt

13:41.721 --> 13:43.356
if you called.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.325
Mom, I have my brother's
phone number.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.794
This is the direct line.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.196
-Thank you.
-GLORIA: Thank you.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.064
Did you laminate this?

13:51.098 --> 13:52.299
Spills happen.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.168
HERMAN:
Call your brother.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.871
-Hi. Hi. Hi.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.520
You go.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.589
Everybody hates me
because of this investigation.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.558
Annie's leading the charge,
and I don't know why.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.429
-You go.
-My parents think

14:22.462 --> 14:25.832
I'm wasting my life and want me
to go work for my brother,

14:25.865 --> 14:29.002
delivering energy bars.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.538
-You.
-Somebody found an old pic of me

14:31.571 --> 14:33.740
-dressed as an alien
on Halloween.
-Mm.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.776
Posted it to Facebook,
got 214 likes.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.711
-You.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.914
Just my parents.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.016
That's enough.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.717
Yeah.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.288
Why do you have it in for me?

14:48.321 --> 14:50.357
I don't have a secret reason.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.759
It's because
what I've been saying.

14:52.792 --> 14:56.063
I think maybe
you wanted the job.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.265
Why would I want this awful job?

14:58.298 --> 14:59.832
'Cause you like being in charge.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.110
I spent six years
doing whatever Ava asked.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.979
Working 14-hour days.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.948
Hell, I'm the one that helped
her get her house ready to sell

15:14.982 --> 15:16.716
after her divorce.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.786
There were buckets
of cigarette butts.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.955
She had spray-painted stuff
on the walls.

15:21.989 --> 15:25.392
When you walked on the carpet,
you could hear the squish

15:25.425 --> 15:27.827
-of spilled wine.
-Good God.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.163
And that all added up
to nothing.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.898
Ava's out, Merv's in,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.733
nothing I did counts,

15:33.766 --> 15:36.503
and suddenly you're the mayor
of Merv's butt cheeks.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.737
I don't like that.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.239
But even with all that,

15:39.272 --> 15:40.907
if Ava had asked...

15:40.940 --> 15:43.176
I would have said no
to this job.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.777
Everyone here works hard.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.414
They don't deserve
to be treated like criminals.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.382
Merv should be thanking them.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.951
Agreed.

15:51.985 --> 15:55.288
I'm just gonna
put you down as saying

15:55.322 --> 15:57.490
-you did not leak.
-Oh, my God.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.498
Oh, bro, you gotta come visit.

16:05.532 --> 16:09.169
You can even see the, uh,
ocean from the side balcony.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.970
Really?
Wow, that's... terrific.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.873
You know, I bet your beach house
is a wonderful place

16:13.906 --> 16:16.376
for you to live
with your secret second family.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.278
Jenna and Melinda have both
agreed to our arrangement.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.513
We're all happy on this end,
so I don't know

16:20.547 --> 16:22.182
what kind of stick
you got up your tush.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.883
I have no kind of stick
up my tush.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.453
No, honestly, what kind of
stick do you have up your tush?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.188
There's no kind of stick
up my tush.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.456
There is no judgment.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.491
It's just blech.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.826
-Well, they both
like you, so...
-Anyway,

16:33.860 --> 16:35.628
I can't believe Mom and Dad.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.298
It's like they can't even see
I have a career.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.800
Yeah, I know, I know,
it's terrible that Mom and Dad

16:40.833 --> 16:42.035
would care about you.
Look, man,

16:42.069 --> 16:43.903
I'll start you out at $130K.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.008
Yeah, right? No, I was gonna...
I was gonna offer you 65,

16:49.042 --> 16:50.810
but Dad said
to sweeten the pot.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.812
He said, uh,
you're his favorite son.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.414
I'm kidding.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.216
He told me
I'm his favorite son.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.185
Wow.
That is so flattering.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.920
Um, I don't... I guess I'm still
just gonna have to pass, though.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.055
I don't know how.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.326
My report on the leak.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.161
Conclusion: inconclusive.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.730
-Case closed.

17:10.763 --> 17:14.234
Can't be a part of sending
one of my coworkers to prison.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.070
No one would go
to prison for this.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.106
Isn't that what they do
when someone tells

17:19.139 --> 17:21.174
-classified information
to the media?

17:21.208 --> 17:23.510
This department
has never been classified.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.178
Did you think it was?

17:25.212 --> 17:28.215
Uh, things are pretty secret.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.551
Yeah, secret like crapping
your pants on the bus.

17:31.584 --> 17:35.054
No. They're embarrassed.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.757
Hey, ghosts and aliens?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.227
It's like a middle school
haunted house.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.362
Sheesh.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.097
Uh-oh.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.071
Oh, boy. It's a real
Kookapalooza out there.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.406
This is humiliating.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.108
We could stay and order takeout.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.144
Anybody else craving
Scottish food?

17:57.177 --> 18:00.313
We want the truth!
We want the truth!

18:00.347 --> 18:02.382
We want the truth!

18:02.415 --> 18:03.583
Oh, boy.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.985
This is gonna hurt.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.155
We've just got to barrel
through, tight formation.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.889
Again, if we order now,

18:09.922 --> 18:12.492
we could be eating Cullen skink
