03:39.671 --> 03:42.180
Why did you come here?!

03:42.181 --> 03:45.400
This isn't the time to ask that, is it?

03:45.401 --> 03:47.611
You...

03:48.151 --> 03:51.881
You are the City Hunter after all.

03:52.091 --> 03:54.571
Boys!

05:11.121 --> 05:12.850
Father, are you all right?

05:12.851 --> 05:16.991
I'm okay, so go catch those guys.

05:19.091 --> 05:23.101
You've been really hurt.
Let's go to the hospital first.

05:24.751 --> 05:26.800
Chairman Park,

05:26.801 --> 05:29.150
are you really going to act like this?

05:29.151 --> 05:33.330
I'm someone who has blocked a merger and
acquisition attempt of Do Young Group twice.

05:33.331 --> 05:37.020
What?
Impossible to revive?

05:37.021 --> 05:41.780
Our Haewon will not collapse
over a measly 3 billion.

05:41.781 --> 05:43.870
A debt ratio of 500 percent?

05:43.871 --> 05:45.350
That's impossible.

05:45.351 --> 05:49.800
Chairman Park, you know very well
our Haewon is sound and healthy!

05:49.801 --> 05:54.790
<i>The mobile customer is currently on the
line. You will be connected to voicemail.</i>

05:54.791 --> 05:58.320
I have to tell the chairman
about the City Hunter.

05:58.321 --> 06:01.951
I'm sure it was the guy I saw
at that woman's house.

06:05.541 --> 06:09.161
At this rate, he's going to get me first.

06:09.391 --> 06:12.611
Before that...

06:25.261 --> 06:27.480
What are you doing here
instead of going home?

06:27.481 --> 06:30.890
The one with the worst fitness aptitude
in our section is Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.290
Wow, that's really suspicious.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.270
At the parking lot earlier,

06:34.271 --> 06:38.010
seeing Dr. Lee Yoon Sung overpower
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo with one blow,

06:38.011 --> 06:39.670
we all fell into a panic.

06:39.671 --> 06:41.680
Agent Kim, you probably
can't believe it either, can you?

06:41.681 --> 06:46.630
Ah, I trained Lee Yoon Sung so I know.

06:46.631 --> 06:52.580
He's very athletic,
so he learns fast and improves fast.

06:52.681 --> 06:56.450
And he's got such an excellent trainer.

06:56.451 --> 06:59.880
Then, it's because I have no skill

06:59.881 --> 07:02.300
that my student is in that shape?

07:02.301 --> 07:05.135
Do you think maybe after he resigned
from the Blue House,

07:05.170 --> 07:06.370
he had martial arts training?

07:06.371 --> 07:09.090
You know that expression he had
when Kim Na Na always flipped him?

07:09.091 --> 07:10.990
That bitter expression...
You remember, right?

07:10.991 --> 07:12.340
That's it.

07:12.341 --> 07:14.890
Wow, how petty.
Training on his own like that...

07:14.891 --> 07:18.180
How can a man have such little loyalty?
Right?

07:18.181 --> 07:19.630
There's really something not right.

07:19.631 --> 07:24.131
I'm going to Dr. Lee Yoon Sung's house
and ask him directly.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.200
- Just a moment, Agent Shin.
- Excuse me!

07:28.201 --> 07:28.953
Look at this. Doenjang* girl, material girl.
(*likes expensive name brand imports)

07:30.301 --> 07:33.130
Your hidden motive to use this
as an excuse to stick to Lee Yoon Sung

07:33.131 --> 07:34.450
is written all over your face.

07:34.451 --> 07:35.720
Look here.

07:35.721 --> 07:40.200
I'm a very curious woman who can't sleep
if I'm curious about something.

07:40.201 --> 07:41.630
- Move.
- Then, I'll go with you.

07:41.631 --> 07:44.660
I'll ask him
where he got his martial arts training.

07:44.661 --> 07:49.790
If you keep this up,
I just may throw you and beat you.

07:49.791 --> 07:52.664
Uh? Oh! My bag!

07:52.665 --> 07:55.901
T... That's expensive.

08:24.351 --> 08:27.250
Has something happened?

08:27.251 --> 08:30.991
He has let even the Blue House people know.

08:45.311 --> 08:47.190
We've treated him quickly,

08:47.191 --> 08:50.120
but he has a severe bruise
on his left shoulder,

08:50.121 --> 08:52.730
so he's going to have to be careful
for the time-being.

08:52.731 --> 08:56.370
His injured leg
must have been in a lot of pain.

08:56.371 --> 09:01.070
Let's wait to see the results of the exam
to talk about that.

09:01.071 --> 09:03.641
Thank you.

09:04.441 --> 09:08.931
I didn't know Chun Jae Man
would ambush this quickly.

09:11.871 --> 09:13.471
[Bear Na Na]

09:27.701 --> 09:31.881
<i>So the City Hunter's name is Lee Yoon Sung?</i>

09:34.711 --> 09:38.140
Kim Na Na stubbornly resisted,

09:38.141 --> 09:40.510
I lost all my strength getting her here.

09:40.511 --> 09:43.130
I just wanted to kill her on the way,

09:43.131 --> 09:46.131
so I just barely managed
to hold myself back.

09:51.181 --> 09:54.630
Lee Yoon Sung, you can't come.
You absolutely cannot come!

09:54.631 --> 10:00.311
<i>It's dangerous if you come.
I'm fine, so do not come, okay?</i>

10:02.501 --> 10:06.591
If you touch Kim Na Na,
I'm going to kill you.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.720
Who knows?

10:08.721 --> 10:14.681
I'm very fickle.
I could kill her now.

10:16.511 --> 10:17.820
Where are you right now?

10:17.821 --> 10:20.300
Haewon Sea World.

10:20.301 --> 10:24.981
Before Kim Na Na dies,
you have to see her face, at least.

10:35.851 --> 10:38.641
Please look after Father.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.980
Kim Na Na.

11:39.981 --> 11:42.601
Kim Na Na!

11:45.961 --> 11:48.481
Kim Na Na.

11:54.451 --> 11:57.971
You know what happens if I press this,
don't you?

11:57.972 --> 12:02.321
Kim Na Na will never be able
to get out of that water.

12:06.141 --> 12:08.451
Put them on.

13:17.531 --> 13:20.621
Na Na, wait.

13:58.151 --> 14:00.511
Are you all right?

14:01.411 --> 14:03.780
Can you breathe okay?

14:03.781 --> 14:05.930
I'm okay.

14:05.931 --> 14:08.780
Let's get you to a hospital.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.480
It's not that bad.

14:10.481 --> 14:12.310
I'm fine.

14:12.311 --> 14:15.691
- Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

14:20.681 --> 14:23.560
You almost died today.

14:23.561 --> 14:26.420
Then you should have let me die.
Why did you save me?

14:26.421 --> 14:27.660
Kim Na Na.

14:27.661 --> 14:30.661
Do you really not know me?

14:30.751 --> 14:35.030
Just because you don't answer me,
do you think I won't wait?

14:35.031 --> 14:36.990
I...

14:36.991 --> 14:39.710
will wait.

14:39.711 --> 14:41.960
I will wait for you forever.

14:41.961 --> 14:43.650
Are you really going
to keep making things hard for me?

14:43.651 --> 14:46.381
Let's go on together.

14:46.451 --> 14:49.620
I don't know where the end might be,

14:49.621 --> 14:53.251
but if we go together, it won't be lonely.

14:55.041 --> 15:01.011
I won't leave you to be lonely any longer.

15:06.731 --> 15:12.681
I don't think I can make it without you now.

15:14.961 --> 15:17.451
Just a little bit...

15:19.751 --> 15:22.771
Wait just a little bit.

15:26.361 --> 15:29.101
I can see the end now.

16:02.781 --> 16:06.311
You are
a Presidential Security Service agent?

17:05.141 --> 17:07.911
I'm going to wait,

17:10.050 --> 17:13.231
since you said you are coming back,

17:14.050 --> 17:16.840
since you said
you are coming back when it ends...

17:33.451 --> 17:36.331
Wait just a little bit.

17:36.711 --> 17:39.190
I'll finish this

17:39.191 --> 17:42.091
and go back to you alive.

17:55.621 --> 17:56.810
What happened to your clothes?

17:56.811 --> 18:00.821
Ahjussi, come see me for a minute.

18:00.881 --> 18:05.211
Whoa, he looks mean.

18:06.661 --> 18:09.090
He's Chun Jae Man's henchman.

18:09.091 --> 18:11.650
He knows my face
so I brought him here for now.

18:11.651 --> 18:15.081
Just feed him, Ahjussi.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.100
What's the use of my taking red ginger
for my health?

18:18.101 --> 18:20.880
When you make my chest
thump nervously everyday?

18:20.881 --> 18:25.921
Aigoo, he always makes me
do dangerous things.

18:25.991 --> 18:27.650
And blocks my credit cards.

18:27.651 --> 18:28.860
I'll release the cards.

City Hunter?

18:46.231 --> 18:49.340
I'll keep your subordinate
well-fed and well-rested.

18:49.341 --> 18:50.350
Don't worry.

18:50.351 --> 18:53.570
A guy who lets himself become a hostage
is of no use to me.

Kill him or not, do whatever you want.

18:55.751 --> 19:00.730
<i>Actually, killing him would be better,
that way he'll keep his mouth shut.</i>

19:02.121 --> 19:05.050
how will you keep anyone
working for you then?

19:05.051 --> 19:07.811

19:10.471 --> 19:12.760
It's not anything shocking.

19:12.761 --> 19:15.350
He even abandoned Lee Kyung Wan
after 30 years.

19:15.351 --> 19:18.281
Did you think you'd be different?

19:19.091 --> 19:21.630
Ahjussi, I'm going out for a bit.

19:21.631 --> 19:24.521
Oh, yeah.

19:29.721 --> 19:31.470
What do you like?

19:31.471 --> 19:34.320
Do you like chicken or ribs?

19:34.321 --> 19:35.800
Or grilled beef?

19:35.801 --> 19:37.430
I have domestic ham from the
home shopping channel in the fridge.

19:37.431 --> 19:39.841
Do you want that?

19:47.891 --> 19:50.500
Forget it then, don't eat it.

19:50.501 --> 19:52.480
I'll just give you rice and water.

19:52.481 --> 19:55.461
Geez!

20:02.411 --> 20:03.720
Hey, Yoon Sung.

20:03.721 --> 20:06.550
That guy you captured,
he's really a weird guy.

20:06.651 --> 20:09.370
I asked him nicely what he wanted to eat,

20:09.371 --> 20:10.470
and he gave me a dirty look!

20:10.471 --> 20:11.680
I wanted to just...

20:11.681 --> 20:12.725
hit him.

20:14.411 --> 20:19.530
Ah, ah, you've been busy,
so I haven't been able to give it to you.

20:19.531 --> 20:22.541
Your mom asked me to give you this.

20:22.961 --> 20:23.780
Mom?

20:23.781 --> 20:25.760
Yeah.

20:25.761 --> 20:27.450
You should be good to your mom.

20:27.451 --> 20:30.881
You're not good-looking for no reason.

20:31.171 --> 20:33.940
Chun Jae Man has already made a move.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.160
Chun Jae Man did?

20:35.161 --> 20:37.300
Chun Jae Man tried to have Father killed.

20:37.301 --> 20:38.640
He's severely hurt,

20:38.641 --> 20:42.490
so he probably won't be able to move easily
during this round of punishment.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.020
The boss is hurt?

20:44.021 --> 20:45.250
Is he severely hurt?

20:45.251 --> 20:47.460
He's in the hospital right now.

20:47.461 --> 20:49.930
When you have time, go look in on him.

20:49.931 --> 20:52.070
Is anything broken?

20:52.071 --> 20:56.170
If something's broken,
I should bring him some beef leg bone soup.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.620
Chun Jae Man, such a bad guy...

20:58.621 --> 20:59.980
Hey, Yoon Sung.

20:59.981 --> 21:02.990
No matter if you're in a war with
the boss right now, a father is a father.

21:02.991 --> 21:05.710
You can't let a guy
who does that to your father get away!

21:05.711 --> 21:11.130
I think Chun Jae Man tried to kill Father
because he figured out his plan.

21:11.131 --> 21:13.620
Father moved more quickly than I thought.

21:13.621 --> 21:15.931
Plan?

[Haewon Construction Cash Flow Statement]

21:34.211 --> 21:36.580
It's as I expected.

21:36.581 --> 21:41.891
Father used the Haewon Construction
contract as collateral for a 3 billion loan.

21:41.981 --> 21:45.650
And in the process of overextending
Haewon Construction to acquire Han-Il Life,

21:45.651 --> 21:49.451

What happened?

22:05.981 --> 22:08.060
Did you meet Lee Yoon Sung?

22:08.061 --> 22:09.090
He got away.

22:09.091 --> 22:10.710
Again?

22:10.711 --> 22:13.201
Again, again, again?

22:15.251 --> 22:18.370
But since I made Lee Yoon Sung drop
his fake image, I'm somewhat satisfied.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.840
What do you mean?

22:19.841 --> 22:20.940
It's just something.
Are you going somewhere?

22:20.941 --> 22:23.710
Ah, yes. Today is the first trial in
the Haewon Chemicals' employee lawsuit

22:23.711 --> 22:25.680
to have an industrial accident
acknowledged and redressed.

22:25.681 --> 22:27.270

The list of background checks that
the City Hunter sent regarding the waivers,

22:33.491 --> 22:34.270
Take a look.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.190
Okay.
I'll see you when you come back.

22:36.191 --> 22:39.260
Ah, come back?

22:39.261 --> 22:42.790
Then, were you going to go straight home
from the courthouse?

22:42.791 --> 22:44.710
Of course you should come back.

22:44.711 --> 22:47.581
I'll come.
Yeah.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.870
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.110
I have a few questions I'd like to ask you
regarding Haewon Chemicals.

23:29.111 --> 23:31.710
Are you, perhaps, being discharged
from the hospital right now?

23:31.711 --> 23:36.490
No. I've been ordered to vacate
the sterile room.

23:36.491 --> 23:38.918
If you have leukemia,
don't you have to stay in a sterile room...

23:38.953 --> 23:39.950
because your immune system is weak?

23:39.951 --> 23:43.120
It has come to this since we filed
the industrial accident lawsuit.

23:43.121 --> 23:47.350
I returned the 30 million I received
for signing a waiver.

23:47.351 --> 23:51.190
Because the man they call City Hunter
helped the protesters at the site,

23:51.191 --> 23:52.340
and even took back my contract,

23:52.341 --> 23:57.201
I was so grateful,
I couldn't just forget about it.

23:57.411 --> 24:03.120
I fully intend to win the judgment
for the industrial accident claim.

24:03.121 --> 24:06.820
You said you were a prosecutor, right?

24:06.821 --> 24:11.320
If I have a recording of a situation
where I was threatened,

24:11.321 --> 24:13.020
would that help me in the trial?

24:13.021 --> 24:14.810
If it is acknowledged
that you were threatened,

24:14.811 --> 24:16.830
it will definitely be to your advantage
in a court of law.

24:16.831 --> 24:21.380
That's a relief. I think it was a good idea
that I recorded it with my phone.

24:21.381 --> 24:23.901
Just a moment.

24:25.161 --> 24:28.831
This is my card.

24:29.371 --> 24:33.620
If you have any questions regarding the law,
or need my assistance,

24:33.621 --> 24:35.920
call me anytime.

24:35.921 --> 24:39.520
The industrial accident lawsuit
will likely be very difficult,

24:39.521 --> 24:41.630
but I'm sure you'll win.

24:41.631 --> 24:44.140
Please take care of your health.

24:44.141 --> 24:46.480
Thank you, Prosecutor.

24:46.481 --> 24:48.010
Excuse me, Ahjussi.

24:48.011 --> 24:49.110
Hmm?

24:49.111 --> 24:54.781
What do I need to do
to meet City Hunter hyung?

24:57.021 --> 24:58.840
I'm not sure.
Why?

24:58.841 --> 25:04.180
I saw on TV before that the City Hunter
takes down all the bad people.

25:04.181 --> 25:08.831
I wish he'd come quickly and help my mom.

25:11.841 --> 25:15.310
If you find City Hunter hyung,
please give it to him.

25:15.311 --> 25:17.740
And tell him to please come.

25:17.741 --> 25:22.250
All right. If I meet City Hunter hyung,
I'll make sure to let him know.

25:22.251 --> 25:27.110
And you, since your mother is sick,
should stay next to her and nurse her well.

25:27.111 --> 25:28.720
Okay.

25:28.721 --> 25:33.571
He's a fan of the man called City Hunter.

25:34.281 --> 25:37.690
Then, take care.

25:37.691 --> 25:39.951
Let's go.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.851
I'm going to try to get a warrant
for Chairman Chun's arrest again.

25:54.852 --> 25:56.270
Then, if people start talking
about coercive investigation,

25:56.271 --> 25:58.460
are you going to take responsibility?

25:58.461 --> 26:03.191
They said there's no concerns of flight or
destruction of evidence. Just investigate.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.690
The man threatens laborers

26:05.691 --> 26:07.490
and even forces them to sign
industrial accident claim waivers,

26:07.491 --> 26:09.250
and there's no possibility
of destruction of evidence?

26:09.251 --> 26:11.750
Even after Haewon Chemicals close
their factory doors, you still can't get it?

26:11.751 --> 26:13.580
The toxic substances
found in the waste waters...

26:13.581 --> 26:15.640
if we examine those again,
do you think we'll get the same result?!

26:15.641 --> 26:17.600
Even if you don't bark at me
with your eyes bulging,

26:17.601 --> 26:19.970
I have at least that much of a clue.

26:19.971 --> 26:21.280
Didn't I warn you?

26:21.281 --> 26:24.040
Did you think it would be easy to knock down
an age-old structure with your bare hands?!

26:24.041 --> 26:26.150
A Senior Prosecutor and
a District Deputy Prosecutor were ruined.

26:26.151 --> 26:29.740
No matter how strong your backing might be,
how long do you think you're going to last?

26:29.741 --> 26:33.170
- So, then I should give up?
- Who said to give up, Kid?!

26:33.171 --> 26:35.260
The composure and wisdom
to wait for the right time,

26:35.261 --> 26:37.900
you don't have that right now.

26:37.901 --> 26:39.260
Facing a runaway train,

26:39.261 --> 26:43.290
you want to show your opponent your hand
in a card game?

26:43.291 --> 26:46.060
The bland and insipid law,
always collapsing in the face of power,

26:46.061 --> 26:47.930
I'm seriously sick of it, sick of it.

26:47.931 --> 26:50.450
Then, take that bland and insipid law,

26:50.451 --> 26:53.700
and you try to give it a spicy sting.

26:53.701 --> 26:56.290
No matter what anyone says
about Kim Young Joo, that rookie,

26:56.291 --> 26:58.661
I value him.

26:59.161 --> 27:02.730
Don't disappoint me and my expectations.

27:02.731 --> 27:04.330
Geez really...

27:04.331 --> 27:05.510
Prosecutor.

27:05.511 --> 27:06.830
What should we do?

27:06.831 --> 27:08.500
The Haewon Chemicals laborers

27:08.501 --> 27:11.651
lost their case
in the first round of trials.

27:12.051 --> 27:14.510
Even with Choi Myung Sook's recording
of the threats, they lost?

27:14.511 --> 27:15.420
They were all crying and moaning.

27:15.421 --> 27:18.220
It felt like total house of mourning.

27:18.221 --> 27:20.200
It was too hard to watch anymore so I left.

27:20.201 --> 27:22.320
What kind of law lets this happen?

27:22.321 --> 27:25.680
Even if the source of a disease's onset
is not absolutely medically evident,

27:25.681 --> 27:30.080
these people have been exposed to
toxic substances continuously for years.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.920
The law has no flexibility.

27:31.921 --> 27:33.260
Do you think it's just flexibility it lacks?

27:33.261 --> 27:36.070
Warrants get filtered
before they're approved.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.360
Wait.

27:37.361 --> 27:40.270
What if the City Hunter
accomplishes what we couldn't?

27:40.271 --> 27:42.620
If he catches him, socially obliterates him,

27:42.621 --> 27:45.700
and delivers him to us,
then we're humiliated again.

27:45.701 --> 27:50.260
Seriously, these days,
I'm so embarrassed to face my nephews.

27:50.261 --> 27:53.200
There's no way we're losing
to the City Hunter this time.

27:53.201 --> 27:54.800
I'm not only going to catch Chairman Chun,

27:54.801 --> 27:55.900
but I'm going to make certain
those Haewon Chemicals laborers...

27:55.901 --> 27:58.870
get that admission
of an industrial accident,

27:58.871 --> 28:01.491
according to the law.

28:02.151 --> 28:04.700
Let's just exchange the president's clothes
and let's go quickly.

28:04.701 --> 28:07.530
You might be late for your part-time job.

28:07.531 --> 28:10.140
Unni, I'm thinking I might quit
my part-time job.

28:10.141 --> 28:12.050
To study again?

28:12.051 --> 28:15.890
The way I see it, I think it would be better
just to do the part-time job.

28:15.891 --> 28:19.830
If you get into college on your third
or fourth try, your anti-fans will multiply.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.080
Not to study.
I'm thinking...

28:22.081 --> 28:24.520
Should I move to the cafe
near the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office?

28:24.521 --> 28:27.610
Then I could see my Prosecutor
Kim Young Joo all the time, everyday.

28:27.611 --> 28:28.770
Wouldn't that be great?

28:28.771 --> 28:31.350
Why don't you just say
you're going to take the bar exam?

28:31.351 --> 28:34.920
I'm just trying to pass the basic math
proficiency test, what bar exam?

28:34.921 --> 28:37.190
Do you have this in size 100?

28:37.191 --> 28:40.051
Please exchange it for this one.

28:42.761 --> 28:44.660
You can't.

28:44.661 --> 28:47.300
Where do you think you're going
in this state?

28:47.301 --> 28:48.830
That's unreasonable, Boss.

28:48.831 --> 28:50.600
If it wasn't for Yoon Sung,

28:50.601 --> 28:54.411
you could have been killed by Chun Jae Man.

29:00.391 --> 29:05.870
Chun Jae Man, that bastard,
must be punished by my hand.

29:05.871 --> 29:10.121
I think you have no choice
but to leave it to Yoon Sung this time.

29:10.151 --> 29:12.440
Boss, with your body in this state,
it would be hard.

29:12.441 --> 29:16.920
You could overextend yourself
and get unnecessarily exposed.

29:16.921 --> 29:20.520
Didn't you say you were going to carry out
the world's cruelest revenge?

29:20.521 --> 29:23.280
Who is the 5th to be punished?

29:23.281 --> 29:27.181
Why won't you tell even me?!

29:29.281 --> 29:31.710
Boss!

29:31.711 --> 29:35.890
Yeah, you're right.

29:35.891 --> 29:37.100
For now, then,

29:37.101 --> 29:42.280
we'll just keep driving forward
until Haewon Group is ultimately bankrupt.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.960
Any movements on their side?

29:43.961 --> 29:47.340
Because of the debt ratio being 500 percent,

29:47.341 --> 29:49.840
it will be hard for any cash to flow.

29:49.841 --> 29:54.340
Bank creditors, Assemblymen,
the heads of businesses...

29:54.341 --> 29:59.371
Contact everyone who's connected with them.

30:00.801 --> 30:04.570
The bank called.

30:04.571 --> 30:06.840
We're facing 1st phase* bankruptcy. (final
chance to pay and avoid ultimate bankruptcy)

30:06.841 --> 30:08.480
What are we going to do?

30:08.481 --> 30:11.950
There are even business managers
from our subcontractors

30:11.951 --> 30:14.450
waiting outside to see you right now.

30:14.451 --> 30:16.880
Steve Lee, that bastard,

30:16.881 --> 30:19.790
throwing away 300 billion won of his own,

30:19.791 --> 30:23.240
was targeting bankruptcy for Haewon.

30:23.241 --> 30:27.190
I even pulled in all of the slush fund
in the Swiss account to acquire Han-Il Life.

30:27.191 --> 30:28.720
Still, we couldn't possibly

30:28.721 --> 30:30.630
go bankrupt over 3 billion, could we?

30:30.631 --> 30:31.840
Shut up!

30:31.841 --> 30:33.973
For now, get rid of all the people
waiting out there.

30:33.974 --> 30:35.374
And...

30:35.811 --> 30:38.390
reserve an airline ticket to the US, to LA.

30:38.391 --> 30:40.621
Yes.

30:42.561 --> 30:45.001
Absolutely not...

30:45.421 --> 30:49.011
I'm absolutely not going
to be taken down so easily.

30:49.331 --> 30:53.680
I'm Chun Jae Man.

30:53.681 --> 30:56.711
Chun Jae Man!

31:04.951 --> 31:06.172
[Haewon Construction Can't Block
3 Billion Won 1st Phase Bankruptcy]

31:06.173 --> 31:08.610
1st phase bankruptcy?

31:08.611 --> 31:13.070
Subsidiaries
are also in danger of bankruptcy?

31:13.071 --> 31:16.390
It's not possible that Haewon Group
could be ruined. It's not, right?

31:16.391 --> 31:18.080
You never know.

31:18.081 --> 31:22.390
From what I hear, their debt ratio
is 500 percent. It probably won't be easy.

31:22.391 --> 31:26.580
Oh, no.
My brother works at a Haewon company.

31:26.581 --> 31:30.710
He's planning to get married in the fall
and has reserved a hall and everything.

31:30.711 --> 31:32.860
They won't really be ruined, will they?

31:32.861 --> 31:36.461
Ah, to brother-in-law...

31:36.671 --> 31:38.760
Ah, I mean to your brother...

31:38.761 --> 31:41.550
I'm sorry, but frankly,
there's no job like one in the Blue House.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.780
The president can only stay for 5 years,

31:44.781 --> 31:47.140
but we're secure until retirement age,

31:47.141 --> 31:49.170
and it's a safe job, how great is that?

31:49.171 --> 31:53.630
So, when you're picking a man,
don't look far,

31:53.631 --> 31:55.780
but look close to you, close.

31:55.781 --> 31:58.381
Should I?

31:59.221 --> 32:02.550
Oh?
It's Dr. Lee Yoon Sung!

32:02.551 --> 32:06.051
Oh!
Dr. Lee.

32:08.081 --> 32:09.860
This is rather a grand welcome to work.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.750
So, Dr. Lee Yoon Sung,

32:11.751 --> 32:13.850
have you been fooling us till now?

32:13.851 --> 32:15.950
Explain the incident yesterday.

32:15.951 --> 32:20.050
What do you mean fooling us.
He just got martial arts training, right?

32:20.051 --> 32:23.400
But where is it?
Is it really expensive?

32:23.401 --> 32:24.830
Well that's all fine,

32:24.831 --> 32:28.020
but what exactly is your relationship
with Prosecutor Kim Young Joo? Huh?

32:28.021 --> 32:32.660
When I told him you were out, his eyes
got huge and he was interrogating me.

32:32.661 --> 32:37.700
I know Prosecutor's ex-wife,
and there was a little misunderstanding.

32:37.701 --> 32:40.970
It's my personal life. I'm sorry
to have caused a disturbance to you.

32:40.971 --> 32:44.890
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo is a divorcee?

32:44.891 --> 32:47.410
If Da Hye finds out, she'll be shocked.

32:47.411 --> 32:50.040
Just tell me
where that martial arts studio is.

32:50.041 --> 32:53.120
If I tell them you sent me,
would I be able to get a discount?

32:53.121 --> 32:55.490
I don't think you have a chance
with your salary.

32:55.491 --> 32:57.760
Just learn well from Agent Shin.

32:57.761 --> 33:00.590
Even if I look like this,
I am a judo black-belt.

33:00.591 --> 33:03.270
That movement and handling yesterday

33:03.271 --> 33:06.750
isn't something you can learn
in a short time.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.730
Did you enjoy the green tea
I sent you last time?

33:09.731 --> 33:11.530
The green tea?

33:11.531 --> 33:13.130
Of course.

33:13.131 --> 33:16.090
I've been drinking green tea so much lately,
that my skin...

33:16.091 --> 33:17.620
is swollen puffy.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.960
Totally!

33:18.961 --> 33:24.931
And because she drinks so much, she
goes to the restroom like 30 times a day.

33:25.651 --> 33:27.100
Whoa.

33:27.101 --> 33:30.710
That guy. Not only did he go off
with my bag yesterday...

33:30.711 --> 33:33.771
He pisses me off, really.

33:35.311 --> 33:36.600
Ah, that's right, Dr. Lee.

33:36.601 --> 33:39.020
The president wants to see you in his office
when you come in.

33:39.021 --> 33:40.740
Go on.

33:40.741 --> 33:43.441
The president?

33:50.751 --> 33:54.371
The Blue House is the center of balance
of Korea.

33:54.651 --> 33:57.900
This place that is responsible
for the welfare and development of Korea

33:57.901 --> 34:01.941
may not be shaken
because of any other motive.

34:03.331 --> 34:05.460
Why are you telling me this?

34:05.461 --> 34:07.420
I wonder if there was any chance

34:07.421 --> 34:11.241
that someone with a disguised identity
came in here.

34:12.471 --> 34:15.920
I imagine if such an unbelievable scenario
is possible.

34:34.951 --> 34:37.040
Mr. President, you were looking for me?

34:37.041 --> 34:40.580
Ah, Dr. Lee, do you have some time
after work today?

34:40.581 --> 34:41.800
After work?

34:41.801 --> 34:43.340
Yes, I know.

34:43.341 --> 34:46.040
One of your conditions in working here
was to be able to leave exactly on time.

34:46.041 --> 34:48.920
But, won't you make some time today?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.199
Well, it's not hard to make time,

34:51.201 --> 34:52.880
but if it's computer study,
then how about now?

34:52.880 --> 34:55.310
No, it's not the computer.

34:55.311 --> 34:58.770
I told you once before, right?
That I'd take you somewhere good.

34:58.771 --> 35:00.900
When my head hurts and I'm frustrated,

35:00.901 --> 35:04.480
there's a place I go,
and I wanted to show you.

35:04.481 --> 35:06.300
What do you think, can you go?

35:06.301 --> 35:08.950
All right.
I'll see you after work.

35:08.951 --> 35:10.460
Okay, then at the end of the day,

35:10.461 --> 35:12.840
I'll send an assistant
to the Network Communications Center.

35:12.841 --> 35:14.981
Yes.

[Haewon Group Subsidiaries
Also in Danger of Bankruptcy]

35:33.581 --> 35:36.400
Haewon Construction,
1st phase bankruptcy...

35:36.401 --> 35:39.570
By 6pm tonight,
if they can't deliver 3 billion won,

35:39.571 --> 35:42.131
they're ultimately bankrupt.

35:42.961 --> 35:46.070
If this happens, that fire will spread
to the entire Haewon Group.

35:46.071 --> 35:49.300
How could that be?
Still, they are Haewon Group.

35:49.301 --> 35:52.240
Could they really go bankrupt
over 3 billion won?

35:52.241 --> 35:55.070
Their debt ratio is 500 percent.

35:55.071 --> 35:57.830
Even if they're Haewon,
it won't be easy this time.

35:57.831 --> 35:58.990
Don't you think, Prosecutor?

35:58.991 --> 36:02.330
I think an insolvent enterprise
is like a home built on sand.

36:02.331 --> 36:03.910
If it's shaken once,

36:03.911 --> 36:08.921
even kids playing with water
can make it collapse.

36:15.571 --> 36:18.100
Bank Manager Kim, this is Chun Jae Man.

36:18.101 --> 36:20.200
Please give us an extension
on the bill due date.

36:20.201 --> 36:22.880
That 3 billion,
I will make sure it gets paid.

36:22.881 --> 36:26.141
It will be difficult
to push it back any further.

36:26.251 --> 36:28.490
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

36:28.491 --> 36:30.620
Yes.

36:30.621 --> 36:32.900
Why don't you continue your conversation?

36:32.901 --> 36:34.650
No, that's all right.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.760
There are too many non-performing loans

36:36.761 --> 36:38.930
that any more extensions are impossible.

36:38.931 --> 36:42.281
It's like pouring water in a jar
that has lost its bottom.

36:48.921 --> 36:52.361
<i>Your call cannot be connected...</i>

37:01.611 --> 37:03.800
Why aren't you answering?

37:03.801 --> 37:06.000
Haewon Group.

37:06.001 --> 37:09.490
They opened up subsidiaries
like octopus tentacles.

37:09.491 --> 37:13.290
Now, over half of them
are facing capital erosion.

37:13.291 --> 37:18.611
I don't think that anyone will want
to come in and acquire them.

37:27.991 --> 37:31.840
How can you come here, putting
the assemblyman in a difficult position?

37:31.841 --> 37:33.660
What?

37:33.661 --> 37:36.150
How long has it been since
he accepted my money and won his election?

37:36.151 --> 37:38.180
A difficult position?

37:38.181 --> 37:39.660
Assemblyman Lee is inside, isn't he?

37:39.661 --> 37:40.820
I'm going to meet with him.

37:40.821 --> 37:44.760
Please get out.
Shall I call the police?

37:44.761 --> 37:48.180
And what do you think, Assemblyman?

37:48.181 --> 37:51.080
Public funding and support
for insolvent enterprises...

37:51.081 --> 37:54.270
The citizens won't accept that any longer.

37:54.271 --> 37:57.980
They've endured this long
aligned with political allies,

37:57.981 --> 38:01.070
but this time, it would be difficult.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.521
Please eat.

38:07.041 --> 38:10.721
<i>Your call cannot be connected.
At the tone...</i>

38:14.941 --> 38:17.400
Haewon Construction?

38:17.401 --> 38:22.030
It's bad enough they're involved
with bribery and illegal bid tendering,

38:22.031 --> 38:24.270
but they're an unethical company
that used violence to suppress

38:24.271 --> 38:27.560
their laborers demands
for an admission of an industrial accident.

38:27.561 --> 38:29.910
Ah, your cup is empty.

38:29.911 --> 38:32.721
Let me pour you a cup.

38:33.191 --> 38:35.000
The bank president is in, right?!

38:35.001 --> 38:37.430
He's not in right now.

38:37.431 --> 38:39.150
Where is he?

38:39.151 --> 38:40.950
I must meet him!

38:40.951 --> 38:43.070
It's a huge lump of faulty operations.

38:43.071 --> 38:46.470
Letting it become bankrupt
is the best route.

38:46.471 --> 38:51.221
The creditors are all in agreement.

38:58.461 --> 39:02.011
How can you all do this?

39:09.071 --> 39:11.601
Lee Jin Pyo.

39:11.841 --> 39:14.460
Sitting in the president's seat,

39:14.461 --> 39:18.370
I've been able to see the problems
very clearly.

39:18.371 --> 39:21.560
Haewon Group is a sinking boat.

39:21.561 --> 39:23.820
Jostling it recklessly

39:23.821 --> 39:28.151
will only result in a bigger loss.

39:29.341 --> 39:32.410
The 300 billion I invested,

39:32.411 --> 39:35.881
I've already given up on it.

39:43.751 --> 39:46.621
Please save me.

39:47.581 --> 39:52.470
The 2030 classified document that you want,

39:52.471 --> 39:55.211
I will hand it over to you.

39:55.281 --> 39:56.590
Classified document?

39:56.591 --> 39:59.871
- Hmm?
- What is that?

40:00.711 --> 40:05.781
Classified document?
What are you talking about?

40:06.051 --> 40:07.920
Chairman Chun...

40:07.921 --> 40:12.030
I see the bankruptcy
has put you in quite a state of shock.

40:12.031 --> 40:15.630
We are currently
having an important discussion,

40:15.631 --> 40:18.601
so could you please leave?

40:23.541 --> 40:25.030
Let go, You Punks.

40:25.031 --> 40:27.040
Let go. Let go!

40:27.041 --> 40:29.431
Let go!

40:42.111 --> 40:44.350
I, Chun Jae Man

40:44.351 --> 40:47.341
will not go down like this.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.920
When I was young,
my father taught me how to fish.

41:08.921 --> 41:12.560
From baiting to skinning...

41:12.561 --> 41:14.450
I want to bring my son,

41:14.451 --> 41:17.370
but he has gone into the army
and I don't have anyone.

41:17.371 --> 41:20.040
Since you've come with me at least,

41:20.041 --> 41:22.140
I'm grateful.

41:22.141 --> 41:24.591
Don't mention it.

41:33.341 --> 41:36.541
It's Chairman Chun Jae Man.
What shall I do?

41:45.961 --> 41:47.910
Yes, this is Choi Eung Chan.

41:47.911 --> 41:49.220
Mr. President.

41:49.221 --> 41:51.790
I'm calling because it's urgent.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.300
The construction firm
is facing 1st phase bankruptcy.

41:54.301 --> 41:55.740
<i>Please help me avoid final bankruptcy</i>

41:55.741 --> 41:57.820
by gathering up 3.5 billion won for me.

41:57.821 --> 41:59.390
If we can't block this,

41:59.391 --> 42:04.481
Haewon subsidiaries
will fall bankrupt one by one.

42:04.581 --> 42:07.290
You have good personal connections
so I'm sure you'll be able to get it soon.

42:07.291 --> 42:11.070
Everybody is avoiding me right now!

42:11.071 --> 42:15.260
Do you know how many companies
go bankrupt everyday in Korea?

42:15.261 --> 42:17.220
If one person suffers bankruptcy...

42:17.221 --> 42:20.490
and another blocks bankruptcy
because he knows the president well,

42:20.491 --> 42:23.420
the principles of fairness and equity
would be violated.

42:23.421 --> 42:26.380
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

42:26.381 --> 42:31.060
If I'm ruined, do you know
how many jobs will be lost?!

42:31.061 --> 42:34.970
Those jobs you promised to create
will completely disappear!

42:34.971 --> 42:37.950
The pus must be extracted
for the abscess to heal.

42:37.951 --> 42:42.200
I told you many times to value your laborers
and admit to an industrial accident.

42:42.201 --> 42:46.050
Faulty management can't just be left alone
and allowed to continue.

42:46.051 --> 42:49.241
I'm rather busy
and need to get off the phone now.

42:52.661 --> 42:54.270
Don't accept his calls anymore.

42:54.271 --> 42:56.981
Yes, Mr. President.

43:00.801 --> 43:04.540
The weather is rather hot. Shall I buy
something cold to drink for everyone?

43:04.541 --> 43:07.900
Sure. If you're buying,
I'll have something to drink.

43:07.901 --> 43:09.380
Agent Kim Na Na.

43:09.381 --> 43:12.370
Go with him so we all can have some.

43:12.371 --> 43:14.511
Yes, Sir.

43:21.971 --> 43:24.961
Chae Man, fellow...

43:25.331 --> 43:28.891
Why can't you end your greed?

43:37.151 --> 43:39.741
You go on back.

43:40.561 --> 43:43.451
I'll go myself.

43:50.081 --> 43:52.521
<i>Just a little bit...</i>

43:52.781 --> 43:55.811
Wait just a little bit.

43:57.061 --> 43:59.851
I can see the end now.

44:46.621 --> 44:48.941
What is that?

44:49.131 --> 44:52.221
I bought some refreshments.

44:57.521 --> 44:58.980
What's the matter?

44:58.981 --> 45:02.061
Nothing, it's nothing.

45:11.451 --> 45:14.470
- Here drink this.
- Ah, thank you.

45:14.471 --> 45:18.341
Chief, aren't you a little too tense today?

45:18.571 --> 45:21.531
I didn't hear his footsteps.

45:22.441 --> 45:25.471
Please drink some of these.

45:31.951 --> 45:34.690
[Finance:
Haewon Group Final Bankruptcy Procedures]

45:34.691 --> 45:36.650
Huh?

45:36.651 --> 45:40.481
Haewon Construction
final bankruptcy procedures?

45:40.801 --> 45:43.300
Oh, Yoon Sung.
Look at this.

45:43.301 --> 45:46.560
They say they're proceeding with
final bankruptcy for Haewon Group.

45:46.561 --> 45:48.690
Has the 6 hours passed?

45:48.691 --> 45:50.240
It's gone as Father planned.

45:50.241 --> 45:54.081
Aigoo, Chairman Chun Jae Man...

45:54.671 --> 45:56.440
Now, what happens?

45:56.441 --> 45:58.060
Is the boss going to handle it all?

45:58.061 --> 46:02.960
Since Father put this much effort into it,
it's time for me to step in.

46:02.961 --> 46:05.990
Haewon Group subsidiaries are likely
to fall bankrupt one after the other.

46:05.991 --> 46:08.070
Then, each company will be ruined,

46:08.071 --> 46:09.710
and even if a company
steps up to acquire them,

46:09.711 --> 46:12.470
a mass layoff is probably inevitable.

46:12.471 --> 46:14.620
And an acquisition won't be easy either
because of the debt.

46:14.621 --> 46:17.110
Then, what about the people who work there?

46:17.111 --> 46:18.970
Do they all end up on the streets?

46:18.971 --> 46:20.680
That won't do.

46:20.681 --> 46:24.591
Of course, that won't do.

46:24.631 --> 46:26.620
Yes, I understand.

46:26.621 --> 46:28.400
Prosecutor.

46:28.401 --> 46:30.220
The Haewon Group creditors

46:30.221 --> 46:32.470
have decided an extension isn't possible

46:32.471 --> 46:34.520
and have moved into
final bankruptcy proceedings.

46:34.521 --> 46:36.280
The group has provided a high rate
of financial guarantees,

46:36.281 --> 46:37.930
so it's obvious the subsidiaries
will face bankruptcy next.

46:37.931 --> 46:40.910
Even when the IMF case erupted,

46:40.911 --> 46:44.530
the most pitiable were those workers
who became unemployed overnight.

46:44.531 --> 46:47.061
What's going to happen?

46:48.221 --> 46:51.320
Subsidiaries, partners, subcontractors...

46:51.321 --> 46:53.040
all those families amount to over
hundreds of thousands of people.

46:53.041 --> 46:56.400
They say after the construction firm,
Haewon Chemicals is next.

46:56.401 --> 46:57.480
They fought so hard to claim
an industrial accident.

46:57.481 --> 47:03.221
If the company is ruined, what good
is an admission of an industrial accident?

47:03.222 --> 47:04.770
So, the management consider themselves
creditors too...

47:04.771 --> 47:10.021
and only think of their money
and not the workers, is that it?

47:10.691 --> 47:12.730
Chun Jae Man...

47:12.731 --> 47:14.850
If the subsidiaries begin to fall,

47:14.851 --> 47:17.240
he'll try to flee the country.

47:17.241 --> 47:19.240
- Investigator Jang Pil Jae.
- Yes?

47:19.241 --> 47:20.950
Put an international travel ban
on Chairman Chun.

47:20.951 --> 47:21.790
Yes, Sir.

47:21.791 --> 47:23.490
- Investigator Kim Mi Ok.
- Yes.

47:23.491 --> 47:26.950
The quickest way to get an arrest
is tax evasion, right?

47:26.951 --> 47:28.200
Let's go with that.

47:28.201 --> 47:30.791
I understand.

47:35.181 --> 47:39.081
Is this going as Lee Jin Pyo planned?

47:40.691 --> 47:46.641
I don't think he'd think twice
about the workers.

48:01.491 --> 48:02.940
Prosecutor, where are you going?

48:02.941 --> 48:04.569
But, we're busy...

48:15.941 --> 48:20.020
Lee Jin Pyo's approach to ruin Chun Jae Man

48:20.021 --> 48:22.761
was really excellent.

48:23.881 --> 48:28.971
But, there's something that worries me.

48:29.951 --> 48:32.010
The workers...

48:32.011 --> 48:34.640
And their families...

48:34.641 --> 48:38.431
I don't want them
to go through pain and sadness.

48:38.451 --> 48:40.470
That sounds like Kim Na Na's Daddy Long Legs
Ahjussi. (*secret benefactor)

48:40.471 --> 48:42.720
For some reason,

48:42.721 --> 48:45.940
I thought the City Hunter
might think that way too.

48:45.941 --> 48:49.490
I'm not the City Hunter, how would I know?

48:49.491 --> 48:51.520
I'm busy.
My girlfriend is waiting.

48:51.521 --> 48:54.350
If you find the City Hunter,

48:54.351 --> 48:57.171
will you give him this?

48:58.201 --> 48:59.350
100 won?

48:59.351 --> 49:01.990
Some little child
says he's a City Hunter fan.

49:01.991 --> 49:04.980
He wants him to punish the people
who made his mother sick

49:04.981 --> 49:07.240
and to help his mother.

49:07.241 --> 49:09.940
Then you should find him and give it to him.

49:09.941 --> 49:11.280
Why give this to me?

49:11.281 --> 49:13.500
Because I plan to help through the law,

49:13.501 --> 49:16.031
those people.

49:16.611 --> 49:18.430
Give it your best shot to help them.

49:18.431 --> 49:21.231
My girlfriend is waiting.

49:30.971 --> 49:32.900
He's a fund manager from New York.

49:32.901 --> 49:34.900
He says he has an interest
in Haewon Chemicals

49:34.901 --> 49:37.780
and wants to see you now.

49:37.781 --> 49:38.780
Right now?

49:38.781 --> 49:40.981
Yes.

49:41.071 --> 49:43.671
Send him in.

49:51.251 --> 49:53.280
I'm Ha Tae Sung.

49:53.281 --> 49:56.061
I'm Chun Jae Man.

50:00.351 --> 50:03.030
City Capital...

50:03.031 --> 50:06.330
isn't that a notorious hedge fund?

50:06.331 --> 50:09.650
If you're talking notorious,
Haewon Group is no stranger to notoriety.

50:09.651 --> 50:11.390
Since we seem to know about each other well,

50:11.391 --> 50:13.510
shall I get straight
to the heart of the matter?

50:13.511 --> 50:18.881
We have intentions to acquire
Haewon Chemicals.

50:18.991 --> 50:24.280
Haewon Chemicals is our group's cash cow.

50:24.281 --> 50:26.450
Cash cow...

50:26.451 --> 50:28.560
An enterprise that creates a lot of profit,

50:28.561 --> 50:32.560
but also one with
a limited growth potential.

50:32.561 --> 50:34.056
And the dangerous work environment

50:34.057 --> 50:36.650
has caused problems
with workers claiming industrial accidents.

50:36.651 --> 50:41.850
But you coming here knowing that,
isn't it because of money?

50:41.851 --> 50:44.160
Of course.

50:44.161 --> 50:48.720
But the debts are so immense, I'm
conflicted and still only considering it.

50:48.721 --> 50:50.778
I'm sure other companies
considering acquisition

50:50.779 --> 50:52.300
face the same conflicted thoughts.

50:52.301 --> 50:54.660
A wrong move and we could become
like Haewon with Han-Il Life,

50:54.661 --> 50:58.491
a jar without a base at the bottom.

51:00.881 --> 51:04.770
I heard the Public Prosecutor's Office
is investigating you.

51:04.771 --> 51:09.130
It seems we'll be seeing you in a prisoner's
uniform shortly, the way things are going.

51:09.131 --> 51:10.550
What?

51:10.551 --> 51:13.220
For the head of A&N Group
that went completely bankrupt last year,

51:13.221 --> 51:16.170
the prosecution asked for the maximum
sentence of 22 years and 6 months

51:16.171 --> 51:20.160
and received 10 years of hard labor,
you know that right?

51:20.161 --> 51:25.410
Misappropriation, illegal loans, altogether
it appears to be around 1.3 trillion won.

51:25.411 --> 51:27.840
If my calculations are correct,

51:27.841 --> 51:30.480
sentences for involved Haewon Group
management will be right along those lines.

51:30.481 --> 51:31.750
What is it you want to say?

51:31.751 --> 51:34.390
If you want to spend a little less
of your life in the slammer,

51:34.391 --> 51:37.291
you'll want to reduce your debt, right?

51:37.871 --> 51:43.221
We'll take over Haewon Chemicals' debt,
so sell it to us.

51:43.281 --> 51:45.611
At what price?

51:50.261 --> 51:51.680
Are you playing with me?!

51:51.681 --> 51:54.020
The debts are immense.

51:54.021 --> 51:56.460
If something goes wrong, we could be ruined.

51:56.461 --> 52:00.321
Yet, I said we'd take it over.
Shouldn't you be grateful?

52:01.111 --> 52:03.681
Or forget it if you want to.

52:06.921 --> 52:09.371
Let's do it!

52:11.591 --> 52:13.771
A contract...

52:17.451 --> 52:18.512
Chairman Chun Jae Man

52:18.513 --> 52:23.182
is transferring 51 percent of Haewon
Chemicals' stocks to its employees.

52:23.251 --> 52:27.590
In return, until debts are paid off
and operations return to normal,

52:27.591 --> 52:30.120
the employees will agree
to a 20 percent reduction in wages.

52:30.121 --> 52:31.760
An industrial accident will be acknowledged,

52:31.761 --> 52:35.940
and all hospital fees, treatment fees,
and compensation will be paid.

52:35.941 --> 52:39.200
And, an improvement
of the work environment is promised.

52:39.201 --> 52:43.110
If he divides his stock among us,
then we're now stockholders too!

52:43.111 --> 52:45.360
They say the company debt
is shared among us too.

52:45.361 --> 52:49.050
We are workers and we're owners.
That's what they're saying.

52:49.051 --> 52:51.400
Let's all get better and return to work.

52:51.401 --> 52:56.130
Let's all work hard
and develop a good company.

52:56.131 --> 52:59.340
Wow, a day like this even comes in my life.

52:59.341 --> 53:02.011
You really worked hard.

53:02.261 --> 53:03.650
They say this was the City Hunter.

53:03.651 --> 53:06.390
They say this came from the City Hunter.

53:06.391 --> 53:08.590
- City Hunter?
- Yeah.

53:08.591 --> 53:10.530
City Hunter?

53:10.531 --> 53:13.294
<i>Accumulating debt,
in a state of capital erosion,</i>

53:13.295 --> 53:15.550
<i>and facing financial hardship,
Haewon Chemicals</i>

53:15.551 --> 53:17.820
<i>was successfully sold,
and at the point of ultimate crisis,</i>

53:17.821 --> 53:20.280
<i>has dramatically found
a possibility for revival.</i>

53:20.281 --> 53:23.650
You're not in good condition.
Why don't you go to the hospital?

53:23.651 --> 53:24.780
It's all right.

53:24.781 --> 53:28.580
<i>...acquisition for 100 won
is becoming a hot topic of conversation.</i>

53:28.581 --> 53:30.460
I suppose that's Yoon Sung's work?

53:30.461 --> 53:32.470
I didn't expect he'd buy it for 100 won.

53:32.471 --> 53:37.601
A court judgment
is not sufficient for those guys.

53:38.921 --> 53:41.861
They have to die.

53:46.961 --> 53:48.761
Immediately tomorrow?
[Chun Jae Man]

53:49.551 --> 53:52.050
He must have really been in a hurry.

53:52.051 --> 53:55.570
Wow, buying a company with 100 won?

53:55.571 --> 53:58.060
On the condition they take over the debt?

53:58.061 --> 54:01.300
It says, "Standing at the edge of a cliff,
the company found

54:01.301 --> 54:06.020
a miraculous possibility of revival
through employee stockholders. "

54:06.021 --> 54:08.170
It was bought with 100 won?

54:08.171 --> 54:11.010
Could it be Lee Yoon Sung?

54:11.011 --> 54:12.470
Prosecutor.

54:12.471 --> 54:13.850
There's something wrong with the
international travel ban on Chun Jae Man.

54:13.851 --> 54:15.120
It hasn't gone into effect yet.

54:15.121 --> 54:17.381
What?!

54:20.301 --> 54:22.190
This is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from the Seoul District Office.

54:22.191 --> 54:23.620
The international travel ban
for Chairman Chun Jae Man of Haewon group,

54:23.621 --> 54:25.900
why hasn't t been put into effect yet?!

54:25.901 --> 54:27.590
What if he gets on a plane and takes off...

54:27.591 --> 54:30.481
as you take into account
the order in which requests were made?!

54:30.491 --> 54:32.370
These are major economic crimes.

54:32.371 --> 54:35.710
Put the ban into effect immediately.

54:35.711 --> 54:38.810
Even though they say Chun Jae Man
has lost all his limbs and lifelines,

54:38.811 --> 54:41.640
could there still be someone
looking out for him?

54:41.641 --> 54:42.900
Oh, my God!

54:42.901 --> 54:44.340
What do we do?

54:44.341 --> 54:47.950
It looks like Chun Jae Man
will be on a 2:30 plane to LA today.

54:47.951 --> 54:50.270
What should we do?

54:50.271 --> 54:52.060
We absolutely can't allow him to escape.

54:52.061 --> 54:53.250
I'm going to catch him no matter what.

54:53.251 --> 54:57.111
Call the airport immediately and tell them
not to let the plane take off.

55:01.951 --> 55:03.040
Kim Young Joo.

55:03.041 --> 55:06.321
Go to the front of
the Public Prosecutor's Office by 4:00.

55:10.591 --> 55:13.651
The City Hunter will come.

55:19.581 --> 55:20.470
Ah, Honey.

55:20.471 --> 55:21.840
I'm at the airport.

55:21.841 --> 55:23.290
You worried a lot, didn't you?

55:23.291 --> 55:26.040
I'm not going to be finished off like this.

55:26.041 --> 55:28.390
Of course, I'm going to return for payback.

55:28.391 --> 55:30.370
I'll see you in LA in about 12 hours.

55:30.371 --> 55:32.961
All right, bye.

55:34.801 --> 55:36.460
Haewon Chemicals is worth 100 won?

55:36.461 --> 55:38.340
Just because it has some debt?

55:38.341 --> 55:40.310
Punks...

55:40.311 --> 55:43.153
I'm absolutely returning for payback.

55:43.188 --> 55:45.531
Absolutely...

57:58.971 --> 58:01.511
That must be him.

58:20.501 --> 58:21.630
Who are you?

58:21.631 --> 58:23.370
I've done nothing wrong.

58:23.371 --> 58:25.520
City Hunter left a message.

58:25.521 --> 58:27.120
He said he was coming to
the Public Prosecutor's Office at 4:00,

58:27.121 --> 58:30.551
and that if I wanted to meet him,
to come with a mask on.

58:31.721 --> 58:34.511
Someone else is coming from over there.

58:52.101 --> 58:53.350
Yes, Ahjussi.

58:53.351 --> 58:55.020
You did what I asked earlier, right?

58:55.021 --> 58:57.320
Of course I did.

58:57.321 --> 58:59.230
But, wow, you're quite popular.

58:59.231 --> 59:02.411
The response was immense.

59:02.831 --> 59:03.431
[2 hours earlier]

59:03.432 --> 59:04.290
At...
[2 hours earlier]

59:04.291 --> 59:06.220
4:00 pm...

59:06.221 --> 59:10.380
I will be at the Public Prosecutor's Office.

59:10.381 --> 59:14.370
Those who want to meet me,

59:14.371 --> 59:17.270
come and gather, wearing a mask.

59:17.271 --> 59:21.670
City Hunter.

59:21.671 --> 59:24.270
Enter.

59:24.271 --> 59:26.471
Done.

59:50.661 --> 59:51.470
Take them all in!

59:51.571 --> 59:52.346
Take them all in!

59:52.347 --> 59:54.579
- What is this?
- What's going on?

59:54.581 --> 59:55.433
What's going on?

59:55.461 --> 59:57.220
What is this?

59:57.321 --> 59:58.321
What is this?

59:58.322 --> 59:59.030
What's going on?

59:59.031 --> 59:59.950
What are you doing?!

59:59.951 --> 01:00:01.170
What's this?

01:00:01.171 --> 01:00:02.700
What are you doing?!

01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:04.800
Hey! Hey!

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.681
There's someone over there!

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:18.120
Oh?
It's Chairman Chun Jae Man, isn't it?

01:00:18.121 --> 01:00:19.120
[I trust in Korea]

01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:23.481
Those are army tags.

01:00:26.911 --> 01:00:28.680
Prosecutor!

01:00:28.681 --> 01:00:29.520
Where did the prosecutor go?

01:00:29.521 --> 01:00:31.350
I don't really know.

01:00:31.351 --> 01:00:34.051
- Find him.
- Yes.

01:03:04.631 --> 01:03:09.221
<i>I want you so badly,
enough to make me crazy.</i>

01:03:09.291 --> 01:03:14.687
<i>I’ve prayed all along for us to meet again.</i>

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:20.165
<i>I’m a shell of a person,
more dead than alive.</i>

01:03:20.235 --> 01:03:28.760
<i>Could you please come to my side now?</i>

01:03:29.729 --> 01:03:33.974
<i>I beg you.</i>

01:03:41.379 --> 01:03:46.521
<i>I told myself I'd be fine alone,</i>

01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:52.029
<i>that I'd do just as well without you.</i>
