00:01.802 --> 00:05.373
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:05.406 --> 00:09.077
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.811
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.844 --> 00:12.280
and by the time I got here,

00:12.313 --> 00:15.749
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.752
I hid who I really was

00:18.786 --> 00:23.157
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.260
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.294 --> 00:29.597
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.630 --> 00:31.599
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.632 --> 00:34.502
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.104 --> 00:39.207
I am Supergirl.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.842
KARA: Previously on Supergirl
and The Flash...

00:41.875 --> 00:44.112
Mother? Father?

00:44.145 --> 00:44.778
We finally found you.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.181
Return with us to Daxam.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.283
That Kryptonian girl
has poisoned you.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.119
I'm done being
your prince.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.088
You should leave this planet
and never return.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.090
I deserve better
than being lied to.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.258
You do.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.160
You're right, okay?
I'm a liar.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.863
I can't do this.
No, it's over.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.099
Stay with me. I'm going
to get you out.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.400
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.536
I forgive you.

01:14.175 --> 01:18.146
What smells so...
Oh, is that hash browns!

01:18.179 --> 01:19.079
No, no, no, no!

01:19.113 --> 01:21.115
I'm trying to make you
breakfast in bed.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.884
I'm going for full romance,
here. And you have ruined it.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.219
Okay, that's very sweet.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.856
But there is no way you're
getting in the way of me
and bacon!

01:28.889 --> 01:30.158
And biscuits!

01:30.191 --> 01:31.525
And, oh,
is that a poached egg?

01:31.559 --> 01:33.127
-Yeah.
-When did you learn
how to poach?

01:33.161 --> 01:35.163
Oh, I found the instructions.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.231
Turns out books have a lot
more useful information
than YouTube.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.133
-Hey!
-Who knew?

01:39.167 --> 01:40.901
You have changed.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.637
-Oh yeah?
-Yes, I'm impressed.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.606
Well, I figured since you were
good enough to take
me back,

01:45.639 --> 01:50.478
that I should be good enough
to fill every moment
of your life with joy.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.480
And... Oh, and coffee.
'Cause that's ready.

01:52.513 --> 01:56.217
Well, there's one good thing
about not having to work
at CatCo.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.152
-What's that?
-There's more time with you.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.320
(KARA CHUCKLES)

02:00.321 --> 02:01.689
Any word from your parents?

02:01.722 --> 02:05.259
No. They're just up there,
hovering around in orbit.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.228
Is that what they mean
by helicopter parenting?

02:07.261 --> 02:09.197
NEWSCASTER: Breaking news
coming from Midtown Park...

02:09.230 --> 02:11.064
Oh, crap.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.601
...as a violent alien wages
an all-out attack
against innocent civilians.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.337
Laser eye patch.
That's new.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.938
Well, duty calls...

02:17.971 --> 02:20.941
Do you want me
to come with you?
We can get him together.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.142
-Sure.
-Yeah?

02:22.176 --> 02:25.379
I'll just get changed...
Oh, shoot, my stuff
is at the DEO.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.750
-You are so fast.
-I got this one.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.720
(SUPERGIRL TAKES OFF)

02:32.753 --> 02:34.455
I'll get a jump start
on that laundry!

02:36.757 --> 02:38.459
(SCREAMING)

02:40.728 --> 02:41.729
(ROARS)

02:51.339 --> 02:52.506
(GROANS)

02:58.246 --> 02:59.513
(GRUNTS)

03:08.322 --> 03:11.392
J'onn? I'm going to need
an alien clean up
on aisle three.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.899
Madam President.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.702
I saw Supergirl had
a hostile alien to deal
with this morning.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.272
Yes. It seems to be another
one-off incident.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.306
It's under control.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.275
-Is that why you called?
-No, actually.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.543
I called to get an update
on the Daxamite ship.

03:31.712 --> 03:35.249
At the moment it seems
to be in low orbit.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.352
No communication or signs
of activity for days.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.355
But according to Mon-El,
the Daxamite we've been
working with,

03:41.389 --> 03:42.423
they could be dangerous.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.792
I was afraid of that.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.460
How would you like
to proceed?

03:46.494 --> 03:48.396
I'm concerned that
if we make any moves,

03:48.429 --> 03:52.466
we could end up in a major
intergalactic conflict.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.134
I don't disagree.

03:54.167 --> 03:58.272
Director, I know Supergirl was
involved in brief combat
with the ship.

03:58.306 --> 04:01.675
I have to ask you to refrain
from engaging again.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.512
With all due respect,
Madam President,

04:04.545 --> 04:06.414
if they present a threat,
we must...

04:06.447 --> 04:08.316
We must be smart about it.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.718
And my office will gather
more intel.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.387
Until then, err on the side
of caution.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.488
I understand.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.689
I'll be in touch.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.596
So was yoga as awful as
you thought it would be?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.798
-Yes.
-(LAUGHING)

04:24.832 --> 04:27.535
You're in a league
of your own, Danvers.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.371
Ugh... Look at us.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.574
We're that couple.
With the yoga mats
and the flirtatious bickering.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.510
I know. It's perfect... Emily?

04:36.544 --> 04:37.845
-Maggie.
-Hi.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.448
How are...
Are you back in town?

04:40.481 --> 04:44.518
Yeah. (STAMMERS)
Just for the week.
I'm staying at the Baldwin.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.719
Oh. Okay.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.589
Hi. I'm Alex.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.758
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my girlfriend, Alex.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.626
I'm Emily.
Nice to meet you.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.728
-We used to date.
-Ah, okay.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.833
-It's been... Yeah.
-EMILY: A lot of years.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.471
We should catch up sometime.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.339
Sure.
That would be good.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.707
Sometime.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.343
EMILY: I should go.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.446
And let you guys get up to
whatever you've got going on.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.781
But it was really good
to see you.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.449
You too.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.050
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, yeah.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.354
What about tonight?

05:20.388 --> 05:21.489
What?

05:21.522 --> 05:23.090
Well, she wants to catch up.
We don't have any plans.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.625
No. I can't.
Come on. It's cold.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.495
Do you see how cool I'm being
about this?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.530
I mean, come on.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.632
Emily?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.768
Do you want to have
dinner with us tonight?

05:36.404 --> 05:39.139
Uh, yeah. Sure.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.376
I have the same e-mail,
just let me know where.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.677
-We will.
-Okay.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.382
See, that wasn't so bad.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.418
Remember that alien
you fought this morning?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.786
The one with
the laser-shooting eye patch?
Yeah. Rings a bell.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.389
WINN: He wasn't just
any rogue alien.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.826
J'ONN J'ONZZ: He's from a race
of alien bounty hunters
called Amalaks.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.529
I'm sorry.
Did you say bounty hunter?

06:01.562 --> 06:06.567
Yep. When the DEO was intaking
your new monocular
best friend, they found this.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.404
Hey, that's me.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.672
What is it?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.674
It's an interplanetary
messaging device.

06:13.707 --> 06:18.145
It accesses some kind of alien
darknet for all your shady
space needs.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.647
Is there a message?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.515
RECORDED VOICE:
Name. Supergirl.

06:21.549 --> 06:26.854
The last daughter of Krypton.
Location. National City, USA,
Planet Earth.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.424
Three hundred quartz crowns
upon proof of death.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.025
Someone put a bounty
on your head.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.632
How much is three hundred
quartz crowns?

06:38.666 --> 06:40.501
A lot. Like enough
to buy a planet.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.736
Oh. Like, we're talking like,
a planet in
a good neighborhood?

06:42.770 --> 06:45.973
-Or like, a hipster,
up-and-coming kind of vibe?
-Exactly.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.875
For that kind of bounty,
every low-life killer

06:47.908 --> 06:50.177
in the universe will be headed
this way to take their shot.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.446
Oh, that's fine.
I'll just take them out.
One by one.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.515
Hey, hey. No, no, no.
Wait. Okay.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.716
Not that I doubt you, okay?

06:55.749 --> 06:58.586
But a series of battles with
interstellar bounty hunters

06:58.619 --> 07:01.188
doesn't seem like a good way
to ensure public safety.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.756
Alex is right.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.658
I want you staying out
of sight until we can figure
out who is behind this.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.794
Wait a second.
You want me to hide?

07:06.827 --> 07:09.563
Sometimes hiding
is a strategic necessity.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.764
And since you asked,

07:10.798 --> 07:13.567
I too think that
you should hide.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.770
'Cause I just lost you.
Don't really feel like losing
you again.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.206
'Cause that would not be...
Palatable.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.542
Hey, that's a very culinary
way to put it.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.543
I cook now.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.613
I'm not going to hide.
I'm the Girl of Steel.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.516
I don't bend. I don't break.
I don't stand down
for anyone.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.718
I know none of us can
stop you if you choose
to go out there,

07:30.751 --> 07:33.821
but please, as the people
who care about you,

07:33.854 --> 07:36.056
give us a day to try
and get ahead of this thing.

07:37.525 --> 07:38.659
(SIGHS)

07:38.692 --> 07:40.260
Fine.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.630
Okay. I'll lay low
for 24 hours.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.732
J'ONN J'ONZZ: Thank you.
Agent Schott,

07:44.765 --> 07:46.934
see if you can find a way
to locate some more
of those things.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.770
Maybe we can stop those bounty
hunters before they strike.

07:49.803 --> 07:54.041
Agent Danvers, run a database
search for other species who
might be using this network.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.545
Absolutely. Well, I had plans
but I will cancel.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.514
No. No. Don't cancel
your plans just
to search databases.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.849
That's ridiculous.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.717
Uh, these databases won't
search themselves.

08:03.751 --> 08:07.521
Actually they will,
I just got to write
a program for it.

08:07.555 --> 08:11.692
And I just signed up
for more work, didn't I?
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.060
Let's get out of here.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.263
-Mon-El?
-Yeah.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.264
Keep an eye on her.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.568
I will.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.135
There's just something
I have to do first.

08:27.307 --> 08:31.679
So this is how they entertain
royalty on this planet.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.314
Mother, Father.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.685
We were glad when we received
your message.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.087
Hey, Mon-El,
can I grab a pint?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.757
I'm not working. You can check
with Rhonda though.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.694
You work here?
As a servant?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.729
I'm a mixologist.

08:48.762 --> 08:53.967
It is an artistic profession
in the medium of preparing
alcoholic beverages.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.837
And it is very honorable.

08:56.870 --> 09:01.074
I don't believe anyone
in this hovel does
anything important.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.078
(UNDER HIS BREATH)
That's lovely.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.616
Look, so,
I don't wanna believe it,

09:08.649 --> 09:11.885
but I know it was you.

09:12.753 --> 09:13.954
You know what was us?

09:13.987 --> 09:17.591
You placed the bounty
on Kara's life.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.126
Did you really think that
if you had her killed

09:19.159 --> 09:21.629
that I was just going
to change my mind
and come back with you?

09:21.662 --> 09:24.832
(CHUCKLES) You've become quite
imaginative in your time here.

09:24.865 --> 09:28.602
Is that so? Who else wants
her dead and has
300 quartz crowns?

09:28.636 --> 09:32.873
Does she seem like a person
who has any shortage
of enemies?

09:32.906 --> 09:35.008
I can assure you we have
nothing to do with this.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.644
Okay, so, if it's not you,
why are you still on Earth?

09:36.677 --> 09:38.646
Because we're hoping you'll
come to your senses.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.615
Do you know how long we've
been searching for you?

09:41.649 --> 09:46.820
Years. Spent praying
to the gods for the faintest
hint of your survival.

09:46.854 --> 09:50.891
We thought we were lost.
That we would be the last
generation of Daxamites.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.995
But for your mother's
strength, despair would have
overwhelmed us.

09:57.898 --> 10:01.168
When you were a child,

10:01.201 --> 10:06.974
you used to grab my leg
with both arms every time
I tried to leave the room.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.142
I would have to

10:09.176 --> 10:12.345
peel you off of me like
some gangly little magnet.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.850
And it broke my heart.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.121
Until we heard your beacon,

10:21.154 --> 10:22.956
I thought we'd lost
you forever.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.727
And now...

10:26.760 --> 10:30.197
I would rather die than leave
Earth without you.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.967
You have to trust that
all we want is for you
to come home.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.805
We wish no harm
on your friend.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.075
Remember, we're your parents.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.879
When you call, we come.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.383
Even to places that
disagree with us.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.426
Maybe she's having
trouble parking.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.394
She hates parking,
she always valets.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.865
Do you want to try
texting her?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.867
It's been 45 minutes.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.702
I'm sure there's a good
reason she's not here.

11:08.736 --> 11:09.870
It's okay, Alex.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.772
No, it's...

11:11.805 --> 11:13.707
Look, I feel bad.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.809
I can see it was an awkward
thing that I pushed you into
and now...

11:15.843 --> 11:18.245
No. It was thoughtful of you
to try to get me closure.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.780
Emily's just...

11:19.813 --> 11:21.715
What?

11:21.749 --> 11:24.885
Well, when we broke up,
she said some things
that cut me pretty deep.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.120
And we were together
for five years,

11:27.154 --> 11:28.856
it was the longest
relationship I've ever had.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.726
So, when she said that
I didn't deserve
to be happy,

11:32.760 --> 11:35.095
I figured she really knew me.
And maybe she was right.

11:35.128 --> 11:39.132
No, it wasn't, and that
was a terrible thing to say.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.968
It doesn't matter anymore,
it was a long time ago.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.035
It does matter.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.737
Can we just get out of here?

11:43.771 --> 11:44.972
Of course.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.473
Check, please.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.847
I hate this.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.015
What, the game?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.751
No! I love this game.
I hate...

11:57.785 --> 12:00.821
I hate being stuck inside.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.856
Look, look. I could be there
and back so fast.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.191
No, no!

12:04.224 --> 12:06.093
J'onn said you can't
go anywhere as Supergirl.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.494
Should have never
let you watch the news.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.029
I will be back before
I miss my turn.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.965
-No.
-National City
needs Supergirl.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.300
Mon-El, I'm very happy
you're here.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.168
And not just because you have
super strength.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.005
Now maybe you can stand
in the way of her
and her super suit.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.007
-Yeah.
-Where were you?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.875
I was just questioning
some suspects.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.844
Who?

12:23.877 --> 12:24.945
My parents.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.789
So you think your parents
ordered the bounty on me?

12:35.823 --> 12:38.859
Well, they say they didn't,
but I'm not so sure.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.795
They should meet my dad.
I bet they'd become
fast friends.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.197
Yeah, from what you've
said about it,
I'm sure that's true.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.800
(RINGING)

12:46.834 --> 12:47.868
(RINGING)

12:47.901 --> 12:50.070
-Oh, shoot.
-I'm sorry, I don't know
what happened.

12:50.838 --> 12:51.504
Ah...

12:52.572 --> 12:54.007
(CHUCKLING)

12:54.041 --> 12:55.242
KARA: Are you okay?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.111
(RINGING CONTINUES)

13:02.850 --> 13:03.984
I can't move.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.221
MON-EL: No. Seriously. I...

13:11.324 --> 13:12.325
I...

13:12.359 --> 13:13.360
Um...

13:14.594 --> 13:15.562
Whoa! Watch out!

13:25.906 --> 13:26.840
What are you doing?

13:26.874 --> 13:28.575
I don't know, it's not me!

13:28.608 --> 13:29.476
(GRUNTS)

13:31.411 --> 13:32.913
I'm sorry.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.181
I'm not in control of my body.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.983
-(GRUNTS)
-Ah.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.851
(GROANS)

13:37.885 --> 13:39.119
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

13:39.152 --> 13:40.353
I had that coming.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.322
Looks like someone's
controlling him.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.057
-(BEEPING)
-Whoa, whoa. It's working.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.125
What's working?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.994
Okay, so, I reconfigured
this thing

13:47.027 --> 13:48.862
to go off if there's another
messaging device nearby.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.398
Which means there is a bounty
hunter and he is close.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.236
(GRUNTS)

13:56.269 --> 13:57.604
Can you control it?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.106
No!

13:59.139 --> 14:00.941
I just feel pins and needles
all over.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.976
-Okay...
-It's no good!

14:03.010 --> 14:05.178
(GRUNTS)
You have to run.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.379
I'm much too dangerous.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.351
Just focus
and try to fight it.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.485
I can't!

14:16.323 --> 14:17.490
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.226
Me too.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.465
(GROANING)

14:33.406 --> 14:35.208
I don't think I can fight it.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.409
Wait... (SOBS)

14:40.413 --> 14:41.214
Let him go.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.352
Or the sidewalk gets
a new paint job.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.090
(RINGING STOPS)

14:51.992 --> 14:53.526
-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS)

14:55.095 --> 14:57.130
Ow. Hey, it's me.
It's me!

14:57.164 --> 15:01.068
Oh, oh! I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.370
So, Creepy McGee here
got inside Mon-El's brain

15:03.403 --> 15:06.339
and thought he could use him
to kill Supergirl.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.040
Rude.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.641
Who put the bounty out on me?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.046
He knows.
You can tell he knows.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.117
I'm the most powerful
telepath in the
Alcorian system.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.120
I know more than
you can imagine.

15:20.153 --> 15:23.223
Oh, yeah,
except for the difference
between a gun and a stapler.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.692
BOUNTY HUNTER: You'll never
get me to talk.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.528
You humans are too moral
to do what's necessary

15:30.130 --> 15:31.731
to penetrate my mind.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.366
Winn, get me a wrench.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.667
J'ONN J'ONZZ: Alex!

15:36.269 --> 15:37.670
Stand down.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.479
Come at me, bro.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.427
(RINGING)

16:09.402 --> 16:10.403
(YELLS)

16:11.171 --> 16:12.472
It was the Daxamites!

16:16.143 --> 16:17.710
Queen Rhea placed
the bounty...

16:20.380 --> 16:24.117
MON-EL: You know,
for a second there, I actually
almost believed them.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.018
I mean, you're not safe.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.153
We'll figure this out.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.420
I mean, how? I know them.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.422
In their minds,
they honestly believe

16:29.456 --> 16:32.025
that if they get rid of you,
then I'm just going to
go back home.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.161
We need to retaliate.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.164
I mean, if we strike back,
we could force them to pull
the bounty and leave Earth.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.033
Uh, listen, I like revenge
just as much as the next geek

16:40.067 --> 16:43.303
but need I remind you
that they have
an impenetrable warship?

16:43.336 --> 16:45.138
Well, Winn,
you can find a way in.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.206
No, he can't.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.141
I mean, I might be able to.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.411
We can't take any action
against the Daxamite
ship whatsoever.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.580
-I have orders
from President Marsdin.
-What?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.149
Attacking them could spark
an intergalactic war.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.317
They attacked us.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.152
I'll brief the President
and wait for her instructions.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.189
Until then, our only mission
is to keep Supergirl safe.

17:11.831 --> 17:12.665
Emily.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.801
Alex, right?

17:14.834 --> 17:15.435
Yeah.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.337
I wanted to come see you.

17:17.370 --> 17:21.208
I wanted to talk to you.
Just to see if...

17:21.241 --> 17:22.409
Look, if this is
about dinner...

17:22.442 --> 17:23.610
Why didn't you show up?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.713
I should have, but...

17:29.149 --> 17:32.219
The whole situation,
it just brought up too many
painful memories.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.553
What about Maggie?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.489
And all the things you
said to her back then...
That wasn't painful?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.491
Anything I said to her,
she had coming.

17:38.525 --> 17:42.295
She dedicated five years
of her life to you and
you bailed on her.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.097
I bailed on her?

17:44.131 --> 17:45.832
(SCOFFS)

17:45.865 --> 17:48.535
Seriously? That's what
she told you?
She cheated on me.

17:50.603 --> 17:54.174
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't know.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.508
I shouldn't have
said anything.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.645
But the truth is I just...

18:00.413 --> 18:01.814
Really want to forget
about it.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.620
Sorry, I'm...

18:07.654 --> 18:08.855
I'm going to go.

18:15.228 --> 18:18.131
Hey, so I've been thinking
about a solution
to our problem.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.532
-Yeah. Me too.
-Yeah?

18:19.566 --> 18:21.201
There's only one thing
we can do.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.402
-Talk to your mother.
-Run for our lives.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.337
-Wait, what?
-What?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.239
(STAMMERING) So there's
this planet that

18:26.273 --> 18:28.408
a Durlan emissary told me
about when I was a kid.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.445
It's got water, and a yellow
sun, it's got everything
we need to survive.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.447
My parents wouldn't find
us there.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.649
We'd be together,
we'd be safe.

18:36.683 --> 18:40.720
I think of this because I'm
reading this play right now,
Romeo and Juliet?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.556
Yeah, I've heard of it.

18:43.590 --> 18:47.327
Right and there's this moment
at the end where I am right
now, where they're about

18:47.360 --> 18:50.363
to run away together
and to live happily
ever after.

18:50.397 --> 18:54.201
And I can't help but think
that that could be us.
You know?

18:54.234 --> 18:58.305
Yeah, but Juliet and Romeo
both die at the end.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.374
I did not see that coming.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.676
And no.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.945
We're not going to
your secret planet.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.381
I'm Supergirl, I don't run
from anything.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.916
Yeah, I know.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.285
It's one of the more annoying
things about you.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.287
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

19:14.321 --> 19:18.191
(SIGHS) I mean, you...
You don't know my parents.
They won't stop.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.227
They want you dead
and they want me
to come home.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.328
And they're...

19:21.361 --> 19:22.595
They get what they want.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.197
That's why we have to
talk to your mother.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.732
But J'onn just said we can't
engage with them.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.602
No. He did not say that.
He said we can't
attack them.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.605
We can still talk to her.

19:32.639 --> 19:36.209
Then you can get her to
realize all she really wants
is for you to be happy.

19:36.243 --> 19:39.379
And then she'll realize
that Earth is
the best place for you.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.349
Your mother can change.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.616
You just have to talk to her.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.485
People don't really change.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.819
Sure they do.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.556
You did.

19:49.589 --> 19:53.426
You've become someone
incredible and unselfish.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.263
Just give her a chance.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.664
You really think
I'm incredible?

19:57.697 --> 20:00.733
No. I just said that
to get you to listen to me.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.934
(CHUCKLES)

20:04.804 --> 20:05.805
Yeah.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.776
Okay, well,
I'll contact the ship.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.879
It's worth a shot.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.394
RHEA: Krypton on Earth?

20:27.427 --> 20:31.598
And I thought the location
of our last meeting
was vile.

20:31.631 --> 20:35.402
Uh, this place is sacred
to me and my cousin.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.270
I thought it was the only
place on Earth

20:37.304 --> 20:39.272
worthy enough to entertain
you, Your Majesty.

20:39.306 --> 20:42.442
The Kryptonians were never
very good at entertaining.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.678
Look. We know it was you.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.714
MON-EL: One of your bounty
hunters gave you up.

20:49.782 --> 20:53.353
Look, Mother, I know that
you love me, okay?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.455
And I know that you think
you want what's best for me.

20:55.488 --> 20:59.592
But can't you see that being
here on Earth with Kara
makes me happy?

20:59.626 --> 21:02.061
Call off your bounty.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.332
And maybe you and I can still
have a relationship.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.300
I am your mother.

21:07.334 --> 21:10.970
You do not dictate the terms
of our relationship.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.407
Your son has found
a home here.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.544
Friends, a life... He's happy.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.512
Don't take that away from him.

21:19.546 --> 21:23.049
I know our worlds have
had their differences.

21:23.082 --> 21:27.454
Which is all the more reason
that we need to fight
to make peace.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.690
When Mon-El first landed here,
we didn't understand
each other.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.459
But we found a connection.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.361
Through the kindness
in our hearts.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.429
And that comes from somewhere.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.831
You have kindness
in your heart.

21:38.865 --> 21:43.603
Please just try to understand
that letting him stay here
is the right thing to do.

21:43.636 --> 21:49.075
Whatever connection you
think you've found with
my son during this tryst

21:49.108 --> 21:50.477
is a lie.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.981
-Hey, are you all right?
-Um...

21:57.517 --> 21:59.085
I don't feel so...

22:01.488 --> 22:02.655
(GRUNTS)

22:06.593 --> 22:09.529
I should have handled
this myself from
the beginning.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.636
Where did you get
Kryptonite?

22:16.669 --> 22:19.071
Our planet is littered
with the corpse of yours.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.522
I'm not going to let you
get in my way now.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.690
Your family awaits you.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.393
No!

Wait! I'll go with you.

SUPERGIRL: Mon-El.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.765
No, you can't.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.601
Whatever you want.
I'll go back to Daxam,
I'll be your prince.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.037
All of it.
Just stop hurting her.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.139
I have your word?

22:54.441 --> 22:55.475
No tricks?

22:55.508 --> 22:57.444

I'm sorry, Kara.
This is the only way.

-It's okay.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.031
It's okay.

23:35.615 --> 23:39.586
Son. I can't tell you
how thrilled I am
to see you here.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.855
Mon-El, why don't you go
clean up while we prepare
for departure.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.757
Call off the bounty
on Kara. Now.

23:56.736 --> 23:57.970
It's done.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.881
It was you?

24:08.915 --> 24:11.684
You issued the bounty?

24:11.718 --> 24:14.921
I did what I had to do
to get back my son.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.267
Hey.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.168
What's so urgent?

24:30.603 --> 24:32.505
I went to see Emily.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.640
What... Why?

24:33.673 --> 24:35.274
Well, I wanted to go
talk to her

24:35.307 --> 24:36.909
after seeing how upset
you were at the restaurant.

24:36.943 --> 24:39.546
I went to stick up for you.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.047
Alex...

24:41.080 --> 24:44.517
It's not your problem to fix.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.554
You were never gonna really
tell me that you cheated
on her, were you?

24:47.587 --> 24:49.622
(SCOFFS)

24:49.656 --> 24:53.526
That was a long time ago.
I did a horrible thing.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.761
And I already feel
bad about it.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.996
You want to bring it up,
so I can feel worse?

24:57.029 --> 24:58.565
No, no. No.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.568
Look. This isn't about
the fact that you cheated.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.836
Okay? We have all done
dumb things.

25:03.870 --> 25:08.641
This is about the fact that
you don't trust me enough
to tell me the truth.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.276
I wanted to.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.844
Listen.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.880
I've thought a lot about this.

25:13.913 --> 25:18.685
You have a pattern of keeping
things to yourself.

25:18.718 --> 25:22.889
You hid the truth about Emily,
you made her seem
like the bad guy.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.957
And then before that,
you didn't tell me

25:24.991 --> 25:27.960
what really happened when
you came out to your parents.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.062
And how badly they reacted.

25:30.096 --> 25:32.599
-You don't like to talk
about you.
-I know.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.767
So, I think

25:34.801 --> 25:37.269
that when your parents
didn't accept you,

25:39.138 --> 25:42.241
you stopped trusting people
that are closest to you.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.878
And I totally get that.

25:46.746 --> 25:47.914
But, Maggie...

25:49.649 --> 25:51.718
You don't have to be guarded
with me.

25:51.751 --> 25:54.854
Okay? I'm not here to judge
you for things that happened
in the past,

25:54.887 --> 25:58.591
I'm here to help you heal.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.593
You don't think
I'm a bad person?

26:00.627 --> 26:04.631
No. Actually, I always thought
that you were perfect.

26:04.664 --> 26:07.099
But it's really nice to see
that you have problems, too.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.736

26:29.656 --> 26:31.958
Okay. I'm on my way.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.960
Kara's hurt. And something's
happened with Mon-El.

She had Kryptonite.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.642
We need to get you under
a yellow sun lamp.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.912
No. Rhea was about to kill me,
and Mon-El sacrificed
everything to save my life.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.647
Now we have to save his.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.182
I can't let you do that.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.717
No, I'm okay.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.151
It's not that.

We're under strict orders
not to engage. I'm sorry.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.656
This is Mon-El's life. Please.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.392
I cannot disobey the President
of the United States.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.862
I know it's easy to let
emotions get involved,
but there's a protocol.

27:09.896 --> 27:12.131
I'm not the one calling
the shots right now.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.100
I know how much you care
for Mon-El.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.968
But this is too dangerous.

27:16.002 --> 27:18.971
I have to save him.
I know you understand.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.010
Once that ship leaves
he's gone forever.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.112
He's made his choice.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.747
He's with his people, Kara.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.882
Mon-El did not choose this.
This is not like M'gann.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.818
And if we wait for
President's orders,

27:31.851 --> 27:33.786
Mon-El and his parents
could be light-years away.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.154
We need to go now.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.826
I'm the one that convinced
him to do this.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.728
To try to reason
with his mother.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.395
He's up there because of me.

27:44.931 --> 27:48.868
Please.
J'onn, I can't lose him.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.864
I want you to know that
Kara Zor-El will be safe.

28:25.171 --> 28:31.243
And in time, you will see that
coming home was the right
thing to do.

28:33.179 --> 28:36.282
I already know it was right.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.285

Mother would have killed
the woman I love.

will always be
Rhea's responsibility.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.895
But son, you belong
with your people.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.831
It means so much to them
to have you back.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.266
If this is about the people,
then some things have
to change.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.906
One day I will become king.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.174
And I want to be a different
kind of king.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.377
And why not start now?

29:07.179 --> 29:11.317
Why not rebuild our kingdom
better than it was.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.820
And make justice available
for everyone.

29:13.853 --> 29:17.790
And get rid of rank and make
it so that everyone's voice
is heard equally.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.892
-This is absurd.
-Why?

29:19.926 --> 29:23.062
Why is that so absurd?
We have a chance
to start again, Father.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.999
So why should we go and just
recreate the same broken
system as before?

29:27.033 --> 29:29.301
Because it's what
the people need.

29:29.335 --> 29:34.073
Do you think we survived
the destruction of our world
by giving everyone a say?

29:34.106 --> 29:38.144
Our royal house stood for
a thousand years because
the people need our order.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.846
And our leadership.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.214
Our house would have fallen.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.117
So rebuild with me, Father.
Please.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.286
RHEA: Enough!

29:50.389 --> 29:53.359
It will take us four years
to reach Daxam.

29:53.392 --> 29:57.029
Maybe if you spend that time
in a cell

29:57.063 --> 29:59.531
you'll be cured
of these misconceptions.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.401
Father, help...

30:06.038 --> 30:09.375
The engines will be ready
for departure in five
minutes, Your Majesties.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.409
Thank you.

30:13.880 --> 30:18.017
We can finally get away from
the poison of planet Earth.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.994
So, you may remember
heat-visioning the bonkers
out of this bad boy

30:28.027 --> 30:29.996
back on the rescue mission
to Slaver's Moon.

30:30.029 --> 30:33.900
But with a little TLC,
little elbow grease,

30:33.933 --> 30:35.868
we've got it fully
operational again.

30:35.902 --> 30:38.137
This is just one portal.
Don't we need one
on the other side?

30:38.170 --> 30:40.907
No, apparently,
the other portal acts
as more of a beacon.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.010
So, as long as you have
the exact coordinates of
where you want to transmat,

30:44.043 --> 30:45.211
you only need one gate?

30:45.244 --> 30:46.278
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.280
One gate and one, you know,

hurtles through space

30:51.650 --> 30:55.387

on the Earth's axis at
about 1,000 miles per hour.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.023
And if the calculation's
wrong?

30:57.056 --> 30:59.325
You'll transmat directly
into the cold vacuum
of space.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.894
Let's hope it's not wrong.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.897
So, in order to get to Mon-El,
we have to distract the queen.

31:04.931 --> 31:09.001
Whoa, okay.
Satellites have detected
ion thruster activity, guys.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.336

are about to leave.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.204

But what about the Kryptonite?

31:14.006 --> 31:15.341
I have an idea.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.912
Ion thrusters are ready
and the navigation system
is set for Daxam.

31:19.946 --> 31:20.947
Take us out.

to let go, do you?

me at the end there?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.656
Yeah. She said how lucky
I am to have you.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.292
She's right.

36:33.325 --> 36:33.959
(GIGGLING)

36:37.363 --> 36:38.196
Let's go.

36:40.332 --> 36:44.236
Director, did you engage
the Daxamite ship?

36:44.270 --> 36:45.771
Yes. How did you find out?

36:45.804 --> 36:47.639
I have my sources.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.408
And you had your orders.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.411
I'm disappointed.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.480
I understand.

36:54.513 --> 36:58.784
But an alien who was
under our protection,
who had been given amnesty,

36:58.817 --> 37:01.387
was taken against his will
and we were his only hope.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.555
And what if things hadn't
turned out your way?

37:03.589 --> 37:05.624
It's my job to ensure
that they do.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.395
I made a decision and I accept
the consequences.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.297
Director J'onzz,
I will let you

37:11.330 --> 37:13.865
know when I decide what those
consequences will be.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.869
The ship has left
Earth's orbit?

37:20.306 --> 37:21.373
Yes, ma'am.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.841
That will be all for now.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.257
(GIGGLES)

37:40.859 --> 37:45.697
I just want all of these
sugary... What?

37:46.732 --> 37:48.334
Nothing. I just...

37:50.802 --> 37:54.406
I just really didn't think
I was going to see you again.
After today.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.875
Yeah, me either.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.578
But not for long. I mean...

37:59.611 --> 38:01.380
I knew I couldn't
let that happen.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.047
Well, yeah.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.284
And I'm sorry I forced
you to talk to your mom.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.821
I should have listened to you.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.491
-I was wrong.
-No.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.927
You believe that people can
change and you gave them
a chance to do it.

38:17.563 --> 38:20.432
Like my father. He changed.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.668
He understood that I was happy
here on Earth.

38:22.701 --> 38:28.674
He saw what I wanted
and he found the goodness
in his heart to let me stay.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.510
So, you were right
to be hopeful.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.879
I think we could all stand
to be a little more like you.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.715
More optimistic and brave...

38:36.748 --> 38:38.617
I think you were pretty brave.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.553
No, I just did what
I knew you would have done.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.355
And it was terrifying.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.390
(LAUGHS)

38:45.524 --> 38:48.093
But you, I mean,
you do that every day.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.628
I don't even understand it.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.363
Mmm...

38:51.397 --> 38:52.431
You make it look so easy,
to do the right thing

38:52.464 --> 38:55.401
that you wouldn't even guess
that it's that hard.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.403
But it's hard.

38:58.804 --> 39:02.408
You sacrifice a lot
for everyone else and...

39:04.410 --> 39:07.513
I know I'm beginning to sound
like a broken record here

39:07.546 --> 39:10.849
but I admire you.

39:10.882 --> 39:15.987
Well, I'm not going to forget
the way you sacrificed
yourself for me. Ever.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.590
So we saved each other today.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.392
Yeah.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.793
Just like Romeo and Juliet.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.929
You really need to finish it.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.797
Can you finish reading
that, please?

39:25.831 --> 39:27.433
-Yeah, how does it end?
-You need to finish it.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.700
-Come here.
-I don't wanna...

39:28.734 --> 39:29.901
(LAUGHS)

39:46.485 --> 39:48.454
He's really gone, isn't he?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.458
He made his decision, Rhea.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.728
On Daxam, we value happiness.

39:56.762 --> 40:00.031
He never would have been
happy with us.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.571
We used to be so in sync,
you and I.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.140
The day we took our vows,

40:10.609 --> 40:15.714
we promised to stand by each
other's side.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.551
We looked out on those
that we loved most
and we made a commitment.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.053
To our marriage

40:23.021 --> 40:24.956
but, more importantly,

40:26.492 --> 40:27.626
our family.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.068
You ruined that today.

40:40.506 --> 40:43.441
I am still by your side.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.516
We will move on.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.150
No.

40:54.620 --> 40:55.954
We won't.

40:56.788 --> 40:57.923
(GRUNTS)

41:14.540 --> 41:16.207
You betrayed me, my love.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.186
I'm not done with this world.
