00:44.377 --> 00:47.214
Still the questions remain:

00:47.380 --> 00:52.260
Was it economic,
was it social, or was it cultural?

00:52.427 --> 00:55.430
Or was it simply a matter of human nature?

00:55.597 --> 01:00.185
Why did some people do something
and others nothing at all?

01:00.644 --> 01:03.105
Good job, Mr. Bowden.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.818
It's nice to see a few more A's this time around.
Including Mr. Bowden's, of course.

01:12.864 --> 01:18.829
This concludes
our week on the Holocaust.

01:21.581 --> 01:28.380
If you want to know more, the
library is an excellent resource.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.340
Becky Trask likes you.

05:43.552 --> 05:47.305
- You know who I'm talking about?
- I know who she is.

05:47.472 --> 05:52.936
- I'll think about it.
- No, just do it.

05:53.103 --> 05:59.025
- Could you give me your trig notes?
- I knew you'd want something.

05:59.234 --> 06:03.572
- I'll bring them in tomorrow.
- Ask Becky out.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.325
- What are you doing after school?
- I'm busy.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.801
All right, I'm coming.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.264
For God's sake.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.022
Yes?

08:03.233 --> 08:06.653
What do you want?

08:08.071 --> 08:13.285
- Are you selling something?
- I have your newspaper.

08:17.247 --> 08:22.043
- I'm not selling anything.
- Then what do you want?

08:22.252 --> 08:27.299
- I just want to talk.
- Talk?

08:28.049 --> 08:31.470
I don't have anything
to say to you. Good day.

08:31.636 --> 08:35.932
Bergen-Belsen, January '43-June '43.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.852
Auschwitz, June '43-June '44.

08:40.061 --> 08:45.192
Then you went to Patin.
After that, you disappeared.

08:45.358 --> 08:50.238
But in 1 965
you were spotted in West Berlin.

08:50.447 --> 08:56.870
Listen, boy,
I don't have time for this game.

08:57.079 --> 09:01.249
- Leave before I call the police.
- Call them.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.754
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

09:06.963 --> 09:13.053
- Who are you?
- My name is Todd Bowden.

09:13.220 --> 09:18.183
I really want to talk to you.
Could you let me in for a minute?

09:18.391 --> 09:22.312
Please, Mr. Dussander.

09:26.108 --> 09:30.278
All of this because you saw
an old man in a raincoat?

09:30.445 --> 09:34.616
It wasn't that easy.
These pictures are 40 years old.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.786
But they looked like those I took.

09:37.994 --> 09:44.334
- You took photographs of me?
- Yeah, but even then I wasn't sure.

09:44.501 --> 09:48.964
I needed real proof. So I dusted
your mail box for fingerprints.

09:49.881 --> 09:55.971
That's harder than people think.
You need a lot of stuff.

09:56.179 --> 10:01.768
- You were at the movies.
- You dusted my mail box.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.772
You took photographs of me.
What else did you do?

10:05.981 --> 10:10.485
I had a copy of your fingerprints
from your lsraeli wanted sheet.

10:10.652 --> 10:14.072
It's all on database
at the university.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.328
Are you okay?

10:21.538 --> 10:27.002
- Would you care for a drink?
- How about milk?

10:36.344 --> 10:42.517
- Have you told your parents?
- Do you think I'm crazy?

10:43.393 --> 10:48.690
It takes eight "compares"
to get a print accepted in court.

10:48.857 --> 10:53.361
One or two is not hard to find,
but eight, that's really tough.

10:53.528 --> 11:00.827
It all sounds very exciting, but
all your work has been for nothing.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.372
I found 14 compares.

11:07.751 --> 11:14.633
Boy, what you have done ...
I have to explain this to you.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.930
- What you have done is a violation.
- Like decompression experiments?

11:20.097 --> 11:25.519
- That's a violation.
- I'm calling the police.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.439
Your father's going
to beat your behind.

11:29.606 --> 11:34.736
- He doesn't believe in violence.
- They should start.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.874
My name is Denker.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.547
Arthur Denker.

11:55.006 --> 12:01.096
I'm an American.
I became a citizen in 1955.

12:04.891 --> 12:08.228
I vote.

12:09.521 --> 12:16.111
You've no right to come here
and say these lies about me.

12:17.654 --> 12:23.326
I have your fingerprints.
I have your photographs.

12:23.493 --> 12:28.623
One way or another,
I'll get them to the right people.

12:33.587 --> 12:37.799
This is unbelievable.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.848
What do you want? Tell me.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.687
- I want to hear about it.
- Hear about what?

12:50.854 --> 12:54.775
The stories. Everything.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.570
What everything?

12:58.737 --> 13:03.033
Everything they're afraid
to show us in school.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.953
You were there.
You did those things.

13:07.204 --> 13:12.334
No one can tell it better than you.
That's all I want.

13:12.542 --> 13:18.006
Then I'll leave you alone.
And just so you know ...

13:20.383 --> 13:23.136
Everything that I have on you, -

13:23.303 --> 13:27.432
- the compares, the wanted sheet,
all the photographs, -

13:27.599 --> 13:33.063
- are in a safe place. If anything
happens to me, they'll be found.

13:36.441 --> 13:41.238
Why should I consider doing this?

13:41.947 --> 13:46.410
Because you hung up the phone.

14:07.848 --> 14:11.268
Judging by the results
of your first exam, -

14:11.435 --> 14:15.981
- for most of you, we moved
too fast through chapter one.

14:17.149 --> 14:23.238
How many of you
think you know what sociology is?

14:26.825 --> 14:32.622
As I thought.
All right, turn to chapter two.

14:39.963 --> 14:44.217
Once they were in the chamber,
how long did it take? A minute?

14:45.260 --> 14:50.056
No, the Prussic acid
took about 15 minutes.

14:50.265 --> 14:55.979
But the monoxide could take
an hour, sometimes more.

14:56.730 --> 15:01.610
What happened to them ... exactly?

15:04.446 --> 15:09.493
It was a mess. They would
lose control of their bodies.

15:09.701 --> 15:15.040
They vomited, urinated
and defecated themselves.

15:15.207 --> 15:19.628
Even though the gas
came through vents in the ceiling, -

15:19.836 --> 15:22.464
- they climbed up on each other, -

15:22.672 --> 15:27.636
- desperately reaching for fresh air
that wasn't there.

15:27.803 --> 15:34.810
- There was a mountain of bodies.
- What about the children?

15:36.603 --> 15:40.440
On the bottom.

15:41.691 --> 15:47.489
Did anyone ever survive it?

15:49.533 --> 15:56.832
One time, the gas didn't work.

15:56.998 --> 16:03.338
There was a leak in the pipes,
so oxygen mixed with the monoxide.

16:04.256 --> 16:10.178
It was horrible. After an hour,
they were still moving.

16:10.720 --> 16:16.810
Stumbling around the room
like drunks, their eyes glassy.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.313
What did you do?

16:20.480 --> 16:24.651
I ordered more gas,
but we didn't know about the leak.

16:24.818 --> 16:30.449
Soon they began to twitch all over,
like they were dancing.

16:30.615 --> 16:37.539
Some fell to their knees,
laughing in a high-pitched scream.

16:38.457 --> 16:42.586
Even the guards were frightened.

16:44.921 --> 16:51.803
They didn't die. After two hours,
I sent five men in with rifles.

16:57.225 --> 17:01.438
It's getting dark.
Your mother will be worried.

17:01.605 --> 17:06.734
Shit! I've got to go. Tomorrow,
I want to hear the end of this.

17:06.902 --> 17:10.155
The end?

17:12.907 --> 17:16.411
The end.

18:12.592 --> 18:17.347
Todd, are you up?
Let's go. Joey's outside.

18:17.514 --> 18:23.937
- Tell him I'm coming.
- I woke you half an hour ago.

18:24.813 --> 18:29.067
- Todd?
- I must have fallen asleep.

18:29.234 --> 18:34.781
I'm going to see a client tonight.
There's some chicken in the fridge.

18:34.948 --> 18:41.538
- I'm eating at Mr. Denker's house.
- And do what, watch TV?

18:41.705 --> 18:46.752
I read books to him.
Don't worry about it.

18:46.960 --> 18:54.176
Invite him over here.
Daddy and I still want to meet him.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.636
The policeman said:

18:56.845 --> 19:01.975
"Mr. Denker, if you can't see
the road, you shouldn't be driving.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.020
"How many fingers am I holding up?

19:05.187 --> 19:09.649
I said,
"Well now, officer, let me guess."

19:10.442 --> 19:13.612
"One?"

19:15.489 --> 19:20.452
That was the end of my driving
in America. I take the bus.

19:21.161 --> 19:27.918
I'm now in a wheelchair, but
my sight is not what it used to be.

19:30.253 --> 19:34.091
That's a white-tailed buck.

19:34.299 --> 19:40.555
- We used to live in Carolina.
- Dick shot that seven years ago.

19:40.722 --> 19:45.393
Your grandson never told me
he came from a family of hunters.

19:45.602 --> 19:50.357
- Todd never took a shine to guns.
- No, he's good at other things.

19:50.524 --> 19:55.570
- Baseball is Todd's game.
- Arthur, you want a cigar?

19:55.779 --> 20:00.659
I'll have one of my cigarettes.
Where are they?

20:00.826 --> 20:04.496
Let me help you with that.

20:04.663 --> 20:11.753
Your generosity humbles me.
Thank you for an enchanting evening.

20:16.133 --> 20:21.805
Arthur, can I ask you
a personal question?

20:22.681 --> 20:26.435
What did you do during the war?

20:30.313 --> 20:34.317
I was in the reserves,
as were most young men, Victor.

20:34.484 --> 20:38.697
My poor eyesight
kept me out of combat, thank God.

20:38.864 --> 20:45.996
I spent most of the war
washing hospital linen.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.253
You're quiet tonight.

20:53.420 --> 20:57.340
I'm sorry, it's just that
I've heard all these stories before.

20:57.549 --> 21:03.138
- Todd!
- The boy's just being honest.

21:04.681 --> 21:09.478
That's a privilege that men
must sometimes give up.

21:12.063 --> 21:15.484
That reminds me ...

21:15.650 --> 21:23.075
It must have been my first year
at the university ...

21:23.241 --> 21:28.455
My men took turns shooting them,
but there were so many.

21:28.622 --> 21:35.670
Three bodies were packed into each
oven. They were ground into ash.

21:35.837 --> 21:41.176
A whole town was
wiped off the face of the earth.

21:53.730 --> 21:58.693
Still it wasn't enough for Himmler.
It was a dark year.

21:58.860 --> 22:03.657
He ordered every Jew in Kiev
to come to the Babi Jar ravine.

22:03.907 --> 22:08.870
Remember, the 20's
were a desperate time in Germany.

22:09.037 --> 22:13.542
The Treaty of Versailles
had left us crippled.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.587
They would hide.

22:17.754 --> 22:22.884
We always found them. If the dogs
didn't, smoke and fire would.

22:23.093 --> 22:27.389
We would round them up
and march them out to a large pit.

22:27.556 --> 22:31.393
At the time, the shooting
was no longer killing.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.896
Killing was no longer death.

22:35.105 --> 22:39.568
I will never forget
the sound that night.

22:39.734 --> 22:43.739
So many of them
on top of each another like that.

22:43.905 --> 22:49.035
After a few hours,
they began to settle.

22:52.080 --> 22:56.001
A head would fall.

22:56.209 --> 22:59.463
An arm would drop.

23:03.008 --> 23:07.888
It was a bit like the sound
of blowing leaves.

23:10.223 --> 23:13.101
What did it feel like?

23:26.531 --> 23:29.326
It had to be done.

23:29.493 --> 23:35.665
A door had been opened and
couldn't be shut. It was the end ...

23:35.832 --> 23:38.960
You don't understand.

23:40.545 --> 23:43.507
You've done it a million times.
Let's go!

24:04.444 --> 24:07.364
All right, that's it. Take a shower.

24:08.865 --> 24:12.285
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

24:12.536 --> 24:17.749
I tried to phone you.
There's a party on Saturday night.

24:17.958 --> 24:22.504
- I've been busy.
- Too busy for your best friend?

24:22.712 --> 24:28.969
- I've been studying a lot.
- Are you going to go?

24:29.177 --> 24:35.434
- I don't know if I can get the car.
- I know someone who'll drive you.

26:26.670 --> 26:30.173
I've been accepted!

26:30.382 --> 26:34.302
The Ritzy Vista Country Club.
My life 's ambition.

26:34.511 --> 26:41.101
Officer, can you tell me which bus
goes to the Ritzy Vista Club?

26:41.351 --> 26:44.229
Here it is.

26:44.396 --> 26:50.736
- Do you go by the country club?
- Very humorous.

27:13.383 --> 27:17.429
- Wake up.
- I'll kill you!

27:21.683 --> 27:24.603
I thought you were dead.

27:24.770 --> 27:30.942
It's Saturday. Since when do you
come here on Saturdays?

27:31.151 --> 27:35.572
I brought you something.
Aren't you going to open it?

27:36.406 --> 27:40.577
Wait.
Let me pull the shades down.

27:42.287 --> 27:45.582
- What for?
- To be safe.

27:45.749 --> 27:51.922
- The hell with this. You open it.
- Relax. Open it.

28:02.265 --> 28:06.436
You wrapped it yourself, I see.

28:21.743 --> 28:25.914
- Merry Christmas.
- Mary mother of God!

28:27.457 --> 28:32.504
- Where did you get this?
- It's pretty real.

28:37.551 --> 28:45.183
"E.F. Montgomery Costumes,
Tappan Zee, New Jersey."

28:46.435 --> 28:51.231
- Try it on.
- Have you lost your mind?

28:51.481 --> 28:55.944
- Why would I put that on?
- I thought you would like it.

28:57.404 --> 29:01.158
Like it?
You're a bigger fool than I thought.

29:01.366 --> 29:05.996
Maybe I'll put it on
and do a little shopping, right?

29:06.163 --> 29:09.499
For this indignity,
I should smash you.

29:09.666 --> 29:14.880
This is nothing compared to what
the lsraelis would do to you.

29:15.088 --> 29:20.385
Don't forget that and don't ever
forget the file I have on you.

29:20.552 --> 29:24.890
I tried to do things the nice way,
but fine, we'll do it the hard way.

29:25.056 --> 29:29.936
You'll put this on because
I want to see you in it. Move!

30:14.064 --> 30:18.527
- I see I've been promoted.
- Yeah, it's all they had.

30:18.693 --> 30:21.530
But it's a perfect fit.

30:21.822 --> 30:26.952
- It itches like hell.
- Quiet.

30:28.245 --> 30:32.791
- Put the hat on.
- Please!

30:32.958 --> 30:36.711
Please, put the hat on.

31:04.281 --> 31:07.701
Attention.

31:15.792 --> 31:19.087
What's so funny?

31:20.088 --> 31:24.009
March. Do it.

31:25.635 --> 31:29.139
I'm serious.

31:35.812 --> 31:39.816
Stop fucking around. March!

31:44.196 --> 31:47.574
That's it. March.

31:49.493 --> 31:53.246
Face right.

31:55.207 --> 31:57.584
March.

31:57.751 --> 32:01.129
Face right.

32:01.296 --> 32:04.674
March.

32:04.841 --> 32:08.970
Face right.
March.

32:13.725 --> 32:18.772
Face right. March!

32:19.022 --> 32:21.233
March!

32:32.869 --> 32:36.623
That's enough. Stop.

32:42.295 --> 32:45.882
Stop it!

33:08.947 --> 33:15.036
Boy, be careful. You play with fire.

33:25.380 --> 33:29.551
Okay,
I can tell you're not into this.

33:29.718 --> 33:34.055
No, I am. Really.
It just takes me a while.

33:34.931 --> 33:40.145
I like you. You're the only guy
who never tried to impress me.

33:43.940 --> 33:49.154
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

33:50.739 --> 33:55.702
Do you ever wonder
why people do the things they do?

33:55.952 --> 34:01.249
Think about it. Seriously.

34:08.799 --> 34:13.762
It's better not to think.
It's better to just do it.

34:36.159 --> 34:40.205
Who are you, kitty?

34:49.714 --> 34:54.052
It's getting cold out here, kitty.

35:11.653 --> 35:15.574
- I'm sorry.
- We can try again later.

35:15.782 --> 35:22.205
- That's never happened before.
- It's all right.

35:23.874 --> 35:28.503
Could you blow that
the other way, please.

35:31.548 --> 35:36.887
- Maybe you just don't like me.
- No, it's not that at all.

35:37.053 --> 35:42.684
- I really do.
- Maybe you just don't like girls.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.047
Kitty ...

36:12.756 --> 36:15.425
Goodbye.

36:25.227 --> 36:28.730
You motherfucker!

37:02.931 --> 37:07.894
You have five more minutes.

37:37.507 --> 37:39.634
"Dear Mr. & Mrs. Bowden."

37:39.843 --> 37:44.598
"l suggest we have a conference
about Todd's first-semester grades."

37:44.765 --> 37:48.977
"ln light of his previous
outstanding work, -

37:49.144 --> 37:54.357
- it suggests a problem which
should be addressed immediately."

37:54.524 --> 37:59.321
"Let's work out a time to meet.
Sincerely yours, Edward French."

38:00.947 --> 38:05.035
- What are you going to do?
- I'm fucked if I know.

38:05.202 --> 38:09.372
- What?
- I said, fucked if I know.

38:09.539 --> 38:16.254
- You're throwing it up hard.
- I don't need a lesson.

38:17.923 --> 38:23.136
I'm a fuck-up. My dad expects this
kind of thing from me, but you ..?

38:28.308 --> 38:34.022
- You're talking to yourself.
- I fucked up. I'll fix it.

38:35.065 --> 38:38.151
Whatever you say.

38:38.318 --> 38:43.532
What's with you and Becky?
Becky Trask, idiot.

38:44.241 --> 38:47.828
What did you call me?

38:49.621 --> 38:55.168
You're being a real dick, man.
I've got to get to practice.

39:00.048 --> 39:02.509
"Talking to yourself?"

39:03.718 --> 39:07.222
"You're being a dick."

40:30.180 --> 40:36.895
"Let's work out a time to meet."

40:37.062 --> 40:40.732
"Sincerely yours, Edward French."

40:40.982 --> 40:44.903
Who's this Edward French?
Headmaster?

40:45.695 --> 40:49.282
- Guidance counsellor.
- What is that?

40:49.491 --> 40:53.870
He guides and he counsels.
You read the letter.

40:55.872 --> 40:58.250
What stinks in here?

40:58.417 --> 41:03.463
I bet it's my TV dinner.

41:05.882 --> 41:08.510
We've got a real problem here.

41:08.677 --> 41:12.681
- I'm not the one in trouble.
- We'll see about that.

41:12.889 --> 41:17.602
Don't turn this on me. It's not
my fault your grades have fallen.

41:17.769 --> 41:21.523
You're wrong. The shit you're
telling me keeps me up all night.

41:21.690 --> 41:26.361
I fall asleep during class.

41:28.071 --> 41:32.534
I need a fucking pencil.
Do you have one?

41:32.701 --> 41:37.998
- What will your parents do?
- They won't ever see the letter.

41:38.165 --> 41:44.004
This isn't just a little slip-up.
My parents will freak.

41:44.171 --> 41:50.343
They'll want to know exactly
what happened. Do you get it?

41:53.054 --> 41:56.558
- I think so.
- You'd better be sure.

41:56.767 --> 42:01.104
It'll be your ass that winds up
in jail, not mine. I need a pencil.

42:01.271 --> 42:05.275
A sharp one, please. Thank you.

42:05.442 --> 42:10.405
Does this Edward French
know your parents socially?

42:10.614 --> 42:13.617
They wouldn't mix with that geek.

42:13.784 --> 42:18.080
And professionally,
has he ever spoken to them?

42:18.288 --> 42:22.584
No, I've never needed it till now.

42:25.962 --> 42:31.510
- Don't mess up that carbon paper.
- What would you know about it?

42:31.676 --> 42:36.223
I was forging documents
before your parents were born.

42:54.658 --> 42:57.619
- Todd.
- Do you know what this is about?

42:57.786 --> 43:01.456
I'm sorry, I don't.

43:08.463 --> 43:12.717
That's my son,
he's always chewing gum.

43:12.884 --> 43:16.096
He means the world to me.

43:16.263 --> 43:20.934
- Todd, have a seat.
- Hello there.

43:22.602 --> 43:25.981
It's okay, sit down.

43:29.192 --> 43:34.823
We've talked about what's been going
on. Do you want to talk about it?

43:37.492 --> 43:42.038
- Not really.
- Don't be embarrassed.

43:42.205 --> 43:46.585
It's not your fault. We both want
to help you get back on track.

43:46.752 --> 43:49.921
Both of you?

43:50.088 --> 43:56.678
I must admit that the situation
in Richard's home is appalling.

43:56.887 --> 44:01.683
I always believed a man should
take responsibility for his family.

44:01.892 --> 44:07.814
When you came to me in tears
and asked me to intervene, -

44:07.981 --> 44:12.778
- then I realised this was not
a matter to be trifled with.

44:12.944 --> 44:17.199
That's why I arranged this meeting.

44:17.365 --> 44:19.576
We appreciate your concern.

44:20.744 --> 44:27.167
Todd, I've seen your record,
and every grade is way down.

44:27.417 --> 44:33.298
Even your strongest subject,
history, is down from A to C-.

44:33.465 --> 44:37.469
Trigonometry down to a D.

44:37.636 --> 44:43.517
Did you know you were on your way
to finishing first in your class?

44:45.602 --> 44:49.189
Your grandfather and I
have been talking.

44:49.356 --> 44:55.695
With your father's work problems
and your mom ... drinking, -

44:55.862 --> 44:59.533
- maybe home
isn't the best place to be studying.

44:59.825 --> 45:04.121
He's offered to let you study
over at his place after school.

45:04.287 --> 45:08.625
- I think it's a good idea.
- You do?

45:08.792 --> 45:14.423
I've offered to go a step further,
but it means we have to make a deal.

45:15.465 --> 45:17.426
A deal?

45:17.634 --> 45:22.431
Finals for this quarter
are in 3 1/2 weeks.

45:22.639 --> 45:25.100
If you can give me all A's, -

45:25.267 --> 45:30.230
- I'll talk to your teachers
and we'll discount your mid-terms, -

45:30.397 --> 45:37.154
- and let this quarter rest with the
final exams. B's and C's won't help.

45:37.320 --> 45:41.950
But all A's will show everybody
that you're serious.

45:42.159 --> 45:46.663
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

45:46.830 --> 45:51.585
But first you've got to start
being honest with me.

45:52.878 --> 45:58.633
No more forging your father's
signature on my letters.

45:58.800 --> 46:04.139
This is between the three of us,
if it makes things easier at home.

46:04.306 --> 46:10.729
But if you try to trick me again, I
show up at your door. Is that clear?

46:12.022 --> 46:17.319
- He's offering to help.
- That's a lot to do in three weeks.

46:17.527 --> 46:24.409
- What if I can't do it?
- Mr. Bowden, I must thank you.

46:24.576 --> 46:28.789
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to talk to Todd alone.

46:31.750 --> 46:34.294
It's quite all right.

46:34.461 --> 46:39.424
If you didn't excuse me,
my desire for a cigarette would.

46:43.929 --> 46:49.601
When the time is right,
I'll tell Richard about all this.

46:49.768 --> 46:54.815
He and Monica need to know
what's happening to their son.

47:00.070 --> 47:03.657
I'll expect you after school.

47:16.461 --> 47:21.675
- He's a very persuasive man.
- Tell me about it.

47:22.551 --> 47:27.764
Listen, Todd, I understand
what you're going through.

47:27.931 --> 47:32.561
My wife and I just went through
the nastiest divorce.

47:32.769 --> 47:39.025
I know it's not easy
being a senior and only 1 6.

47:39.234 --> 47:44.614
Your grandfather thinks you can
do this, and I know you can.

47:44.781 --> 47:49.828
I don't want you to feel
like you have no one to talk to.

47:50.036 --> 47:54.583
Your parents, or girl problems ...

47:54.750 --> 48:02.549
Here's my home phone.
Anything at all, you call me.

48:03.133 --> 48:07.929
Call me. Deal?

48:08.138 --> 48:12.184
I'm telling you, if you
get past this little hurdle, -

48:12.350 --> 48:16.938
- the world's going to open up
for you like you won't believe.

48:27.282 --> 48:29.951
Bye.

48:48.762 --> 48:52.349
Have you lost your mind? Grandpa!

48:52.557 --> 48:58.146
- What are you so excited about?
- You've got some balls!

48:58.355 --> 49:03.819
- You played it beautifully.
- I could've busted you right there.

49:03.985 --> 49:09.449
Yes, you could have, but did not.
Why was that?

49:11.827 --> 49:16.373
Your Edward French
won't give you any more trouble.

49:16.540 --> 49:21.586
Now you are upset
because you have to work.

49:21.753 --> 49:25.507
You have him thinking I can
do something that can't be done.

49:25.715 --> 49:31.680
It can and it will. You simply
have to work. No more stories.

49:31.888 --> 49:35.559
- Stop screwing around.
- I don't take orders from you.

49:35.726 --> 49:40.689
- You do now.
- I can just pick up the phone.

49:40.856 --> 49:43.900
And do what?

49:46.278 --> 49:53.744
Do you think I would let you turn me
in without dragging you with me?

49:53.910 --> 49:58.457
Your self-confidence is so bloated
you've lost touch with reality.

49:58.623 --> 50:04.504
90,000 died in Patin.
To the whole world I am a monster.

50:04.671 --> 50:09.468
And you have known about me
all this time.

50:09.634 --> 50:13.638
If I am caught, when the reporters
sick their microphones in my face, -

50:13.805 --> 50:19.686
- it will be your name that
I repeat. Todd Bowden.

50:19.853 --> 50:25.901
Todd Bowden. Yes, that was his name.
For almost a year he has known.

50:26.068 --> 50:33.617
He wanted to know everything.
That was how he put it. Everything.

50:35.786 --> 50:41.500
- They'll never believe you.
- It doesn't matter.

50:41.666 --> 50:45.796
You're going to be infamous, boy.

50:45.962 --> 50:51.510
Do you know what such a scandal
can do? It never goes away.

50:51.676 --> 50:54.971
Not for you. Not for your parents.

50:55.138 --> 50:59.434
Lying to judges and reporters
isn't as easy as you think.

50:59.601 --> 51:04.106
You'd have to be brilliant.
Can you do that? I know I can.

51:05.649 --> 51:11.530
There's no way I can pull out of
a six-month slide in a few weeks.

51:11.696 --> 51:16.493
- That shit just doesn't happen.
- The time for discussion is over.

51:16.660 --> 51:22.749
You will work for the rest of this
quarter and all of your vacation.

54:00.615 --> 54:04.911
Hawthorne was one of the most
interesting writers of his time ...

54:20.594 --> 54:24.514
Why did some people do something
and others nothing at all?

54:24.723 --> 54:30.145
This concludes
our week on the Holocaust.

54:31.396 --> 54:35.817
You are a monster.

54:35.984 --> 54:40.947
- What you have done is a violation.
- I wanted to know more.

54:41.907 --> 54:45.494
A door had been opened ...

54:46.369 --> 54:50.624
- I fucked up.
- Lying isn't as easy as you think.

54:57.047 --> 55:00.467
Be careful. You play with fire.

55:27.744 --> 55:31.039
It never goes away.

55:31.206 --> 55:34.584
Not for you.

56:26.553 --> 56:32.100
- How about some melba toast?
- Sure.

56:47.449 --> 56:54.456
I'd have expected you to backflip
down the hall after such good news.

56:55.832 --> 56:59.961
But you're so quiet.

57:01.755 --> 57:06.968
Today I think I will give you
the day off from studying.

57:07.177 --> 57:10.764
How's that?

57:11.765 --> 57:17.938
How about one of my stories instead?

57:19.481 --> 57:24.611
- I still have a few good ones left.
- I don't care.

57:24.820 --> 57:31.076
I could tell you about
the special soap we made.

57:31.243 --> 57:35.163
There's the story
of how I escaped from Berlin -

57:35.372 --> 57:41.420
- after I foolishly went back.
That was a close one.

57:43.588 --> 57:49.136
No, none of these.
You don't seem to be in the mood.

57:50.720 --> 57:54.015
Today, I will tell you the story -

57:54.182 --> 57:59.396
- of an old man who was afraid.

57:59.604 --> 58:02.941
He was afraid
of a certain young boy -

58:03.108 --> 58:07.195
- who was,
in a queer way, his friend.

58:07.404 --> 58:12.200
The boy proved
to be a very good student.

58:12.367 --> 58:16.371
But not perhaps in quite the way -

58:16.580 --> 58:21.877
- his mother
and his teachers had envisioned.

58:23.670 --> 58:27.507
At first, the old man
disliked the boy intensely.

58:27.716 --> 58:32.387
But then he began
to enjoy the boy's company.

58:32.554 --> 58:37.768
Of course, there was still a
great deal of distrust between them.

58:39.102 --> 58:43.982
Each knew something
the other wanted to keep secret.

58:44.149 --> 58:47.235
Over time, the old man felt -

58:47.444 --> 58:50.864
- his hold on the boy slipping away.

58:51.114 --> 58:56.745
He thought the day might come
when the boy no longer needed him.

58:56.953 --> 59:04.503
So one sleepless night,
the old man got out of bed -

59:04.669 --> 59:08.924
- and wrote down the story
of his involvement with the boy.

59:10.884 --> 59:15.013
Everything he could remember.

59:16.431 --> 59:19.851
From the first day forward.

59:21.395 --> 59:26.525
He wrote how the boy forced his way
into the old man's house.

59:26.691 --> 59:31.738
How he blackmailed the old man to
serve his own morbid fascinations.

59:31.988 --> 59:35.158
When the boy's grades
began to fall, -

59:35.325 --> 59:40.789
- he blamed the old man and ordered
him to impersonate his grandfather.

59:40.997 --> 59:44.751
Even though his hands
were stinging with arthritis, -

59:44.960 --> 59:49.131
- he felt happy
for the first time in weeks.

59:52.050 --> 59:55.887
He felt safe.

59:57.889 --> 01:00:02.394
The following morning,
the old man put on his best suit.

01:00:02.561 --> 01:00:09.401
He went to one of the local banks
and rented a safe-deposit box.

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:13.655
The bank officer told him -

01:00:13.864 --> 01:00:20.871
- that only the old man could open
the box, with one exception:

01:00:22.038 --> 01:00:30.172
The exception was in the event
of the box-holder's death.

01:00:33.216 --> 01:00:37.929
- Then what?
- The bank would open he box.

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:44.770
The lnternal Revenue Service
would inventory the contents.

01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:50.984
But in this case, they would
only find a 1 2-page document.

01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:57.032
Non-taxable, but highly interesting.

01:00:58.408 --> 01:01:03.371
- I don't believe you.
- My boy ...

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.334
- It's already done.
- Look at you!

01:01:07.542 --> 01:01:14.716
- You could go at any time.
- Don't be so theatrical.

01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:18.887
A man five years older than me
worries more about his heart -

01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:23.141
- than being sent off to lsrael.

01:01:23.558 --> 01:01:27.229
And the day will come,
if I live long enough, -

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:30.816
- when I decide that what you know
no longer matters.

01:01:30.982 --> 01:01:35.862
Then and only then,
I will destroy the document.

01:01:36.113 --> 01:01:40.700
So many things can happen.
Accidents, sickness ...

01:01:40.867 --> 01:01:44.704
- You could slip in the shower!
- Que sera sera ...

01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:48.166
whatever will be will be

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:55.215
the future 's not ours to see
que sera sera ...

01:02:00.303 --> 01:02:04.141
I can see you're thinking it now.

01:02:04.307 --> 01:02:08.937
It's in your eyes. Killing me.

01:02:09.146 --> 01:02:16.069
The flick of a knife.
Push me down the steps.

01:02:16.236 --> 01:02:19.823
I'm old. You are strong and angry.

01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:26.288
Good assets for killing,
but there is something missing.

01:02:28.039 --> 01:02:32.836
To have someone in your control.

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:39.092
To have them know
that they are alive -

01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:43.847
- because you have not decided
to the contrary.

01:02:44.973 --> 01:02:48.977
Do you have that power?
Ask yourself.

01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:52.606
It's not an easy question.
I think you know that.

01:02:59.738 --> 01:03:03.158
You know this means we're through,
don't you?

01:03:03.325 --> 01:03:08.121
You won't be seeing me round here
anymore.

01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:12.542
I suppose I won't.

01:03:16.922 --> 01:03:22.677
- What are you doing?
- This is the end.

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:28.350
Here.

01:03:31.228 --> 01:03:38.360
Drink. To our lives together.
The beginning and the end.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:50.831
- I think you should fuck yourself!
- My dear boy ...

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:56.253
Don't you see?
We are fucking each other.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:42.335
Watch your step.

01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:20.457
Sir? Excuse me ...

01:07:26.505 --> 01:07:31.093
I could help you carry those.
Don't be afraid.

01:07:31.259 --> 01:07:37.265
- I don't need your help.
- I'm not a bad guy.

01:07:37.432 --> 01:07:42.771
- I just want ...
- What? Why do you bother me?

01:07:42.938 --> 01:07:47.609
We're practically neighbours.
I stay right over there most nights.

01:07:47.776 --> 01:07:53.073
I see you walk down the street.
I just want to help.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.285
- It's called being neighbourly.
- Piss off.

01:07:57.494 --> 01:08:02.290
There's no reason to be rude.

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:08.505
I know something about you.

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:14.010
I know you're a nice guy.

01:08:14.803 --> 01:08:18.724
I'm nice, too. Just like the boy.

01:08:20.517 --> 01:08:22.978
I see.

01:08:23.145 --> 01:08:28.024
I'm not ashamed to say
that I could use a drink about now.

01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:32.319
But I don't take no charity.

01:08:32.487 --> 01:08:36.992
If you were to invite me in as
a friend, we could have a drink.

01:08:37.158 --> 01:08:41.537
- A drink?
- That's what I'm saying.

01:08:41.705 --> 01:08:47.335
- You smell like a toilet.
- Maybe I could use your shower.

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:53.925
But first a drink.
Then I will do anything you say.

01:09:07.064 --> 01:09:12.736
I had him hooked up, rolling,
411/2 ... 3 minutes.

01:09:12.903 --> 01:09:17.282
That was my best time.

01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:25.332
I didn't see that dog
in the back seat.

01:09:25.499 --> 01:09:28.542
- What dog?
- I heard it barking.

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:33.215
I hear dogs barking all the time,
even when they ain't there.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:38.595
I didn't pay no mind.
So the DOT didn't want to hire me.

01:09:38.761 --> 01:09:43.350
Anyway ...
Who wants to talk about that?

01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:48.814
So, I was ... an independent.

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:53.234
It meant that I could go all over.

01:09:53.402 --> 01:09:59.658
I believe we need another bottle.

01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:04.913
If you're offering.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.751
It's no trouble at all.
Why don't you take mine?

01:10:17.843 --> 01:10:24.182
Like I was saying,
I worked as an independent.

01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:28.061
The DOT, they wouldn't hire me.

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:32.858
I was able
to go all over the whole city.

01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:39.114
- Midtown, downtown ...
- Where is my bottle opener?

01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:43.702
You stay right there.

01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:56.298
Then I moved on.
Washington Heights was always good.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.183
The Dominicans there like ...

01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:22.115
Then they dropped that cinder block
on that cop and it got all crazy.

01:11:22.282 --> 01:11:27.329
But you've got to be moving or they
catch you hooking their ride.

01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:55.482
Do you mind?

01:11:55.649 --> 01:11:59.486
No, not at all.

01:12:10.163 --> 01:12:16.044
Maybe in the morning
you could let me have $1 0.

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:19.965
Yeah, perhaps.

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:26.221
- Maybe even 20.
- Perhaps, we shall see.

01:12:26.847 --> 01:12:31.727
- Relax, I've done this before.
- That's all right ...

01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:37.858
- So have l.
- Let me go pee first.

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:54.518
- Did you even look at this?
- That bill was in Japanese.

01:13:54.684 --> 01:13:59.731
- The numbers are the same.
- The man did not speak English.

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:06.655
- You look before paying a bill.
- I didn't understand what he said.

01:14:07.697 --> 01:14:10.867
Hello ... Yes.

01:14:11.034 --> 01:14:15.455
- Maybe it was in yen.
- Maybe it is.

01:14:16.665 --> 01:14:21.169
Todd, it's Mr. Denker.
He sounds very anxious.

01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:29.302
- Why should he ring now?
- Come over.

01:14:29.469 --> 01:14:38.061
- I'm having a heart attack.
- I have to study my trig.

01:14:38.228 --> 01:14:41.356
I understand you cannot talk.

01:14:41.565 --> 01:14:45.861
I cannot call an ambulance.
I need help.

01:14:46.027 --> 01:14:49.197
And that means you need help.

01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:54.035
- If you put it that way.
- Tell your parents I have a letter.

01:14:54.244 --> 01:14:59.207
- That I need you to read it to me.
- Sure, I'll be right over.

01:15:00.751 --> 01:15:04.087
Now we'll see what you're made of.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.232
What happened?

01:15:24.441 --> 01:15:28.612
- Where are you bleeding?
- It's not my blood.

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:31.907
It was self-defence.

01:15:32.074 --> 01:15:34.618
- What?
- Shut up!

01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:40.123
Nobody comes here before you
have done what needs to be done.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.293
Go down the steps.

01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:58.433
- What did you do?
- Go down the steps.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.520
That's right.

01:16:15.826 --> 01:16:19.246
Let me the fuck out of here.

01:16:19.413 --> 01:16:26.420
If you won't help me,
I have to make you. That's enough!

01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:40.934
If you're going to behave
like a fucking schoolgirl ...

01:16:42.185 --> 01:16:46.356
I'm going to break your
goddamn door down!

01:16:53.196 --> 01:16:57.200
Don't be afraid, boy.

01:17:00.162 --> 01:17:04.332
- Now what are you doing?
- I'll break the door down.

01:17:04.499 --> 01:17:10.464
What are you doing?
There is no point.

01:17:43.622 --> 01:17:47.292
Why are you doing this?

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:22.763
Call an ambulance.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.934
The key.

01:19:29.853 --> 01:19:34.483
The key of the safe-deposit box,
where is it?

01:19:34.649 --> 01:19:39.613
I need a doctor. Now.

01:19:40.697 --> 01:19:43.533
Give me the key.

01:19:46.203 --> 01:19:50.332
I'm dying.

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:54.795
I know.

01:19:59.966 --> 01:20:05.889
Oh, no ... not like this.
Please.

01:20:18.944 --> 01:20:21.238
You did good, son.

01:20:21.405 --> 01:20:24.032
You did real good.

01:20:46.847 --> 01:20:52.394
It's a good thing you called.
You saved his life.

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:30.307
Dad, let's go and make sure
he gets checked-in all right.

01:22:37.707 --> 01:22:39.835
You shouldn't have.

01:22:41.628 --> 01:22:45.048
It's from my mother.

01:22:49.594 --> 01:22:54.182
They say the operation
was a success.

01:22:55.183 --> 01:22:59.104
They say I have another 20 years.

01:22:59.312 --> 01:23:04.192
A new lease on life.

01:23:17.247 --> 01:23:22.377
I took care of everything.
Where is the key?

01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:34.765
There's no safe-deposit box.

01:23:34.931 --> 01:23:39.519
There never was. I lied.

01:23:41.563 --> 01:23:45.776
I had to protect myself from you.

01:23:45.942 --> 01:23:49.071
You understand?

01:23:54.076 --> 01:23:59.915
I suspect that we will never
see each other again.

01:24:00.082 --> 01:24:03.418
- No.
- Wait.

01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:07.547
I want to ask you something.

01:24:08.965 --> 01:24:12.886
What?

01:24:13.053 --> 01:24:17.265
What did it feel like?

01:24:25.982 --> 01:24:29.736
- I better go.
- Wait.

01:24:29.945 --> 01:24:35.742
Perhaps I could
persuade you to stay.

01:24:35.909 --> 01:24:42.082
Just until I fall asleep.
My medicine makes me drowsy.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:47.546
Please?

01:25:16.908 --> 01:25:22.664
You are a very good boy
to visit your grandfather like that.

01:25:22.831 --> 01:25:29.004
- Thank you. He's just a friend.
- You are a very good friend.

01:25:29.212 --> 01:25:35.969
Is he very bad off?
He doesn't talk much.

01:25:36.136 --> 01:25:39.556
- He'll be out soon.
- That's good news.

01:25:39.765 --> 01:25:43.977
From his accent,
I would guess he was German.

01:25:44.144 --> 01:25:48.523
- From the south, I think.
- I don't know.

01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:51.610
Was he in the war?

01:25:52.736 --> 01:25:57.699
- He's never mentioned it.
- It doesn't matter, I suppose.

01:25:57.908 --> 01:26:03.830
It was a long time ago, the war.
Soon we will have a President -

01:26:03.997 --> 01:26:09.836
- born after the war was over.
How about that?

01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:16.385
- I'm sure you're right.
- He's very lucky to have you.

01:26:16.593 --> 01:26:19.054
A great man once said:

01:26:19.221 --> 01:26:23.767
"No man is an island,
entire of itself."

01:26:23.934 --> 01:26:28.730
John Donne. Have a nice evening.

01:26:42.786 --> 01:26:47.416
- You stop that kind of talk.
- How about this kind of talk?

01:26:54.631 --> 01:26:58.301
That's just a warning.

01:26:58.468 --> 01:27:02.556
If you crave for Florence's food,
that's a weird craving.

01:27:02.723 --> 01:27:08.812
- Jenny's the one who's pregnant.
- They had something to tell us.

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:12.607
We 're going
to be grandparents again.

01:27:12.816 --> 01:27:16.862
Ijust can't wait
to tell everybody.

01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:19.735
What's wrong?

01:29:45.761 --> 01:29:48.388
Wake up.

01:29:51.808 --> 01:29:57.856
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, I'm speaking to you.

01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:23.090
Mr. Kramer
is recuperating elsewhere.

01:30:23.298 --> 01:30:26.802
- Are you awake now, Dussander?
- Yes.

01:30:26.968 --> 01:30:32.099
But you seem to have confused me
with someone else.

01:30:32.307 --> 01:30:38.313
My name is Denker.
You have the wrong room.

01:30:38.522 --> 01:30:42.192
My name is Weiskopf,
and you are Kurt Dussander.

01:30:42.401 --> 01:30:48.740
I know no one by that name.
Should I call the nurse?

01:30:50.575 --> 01:30:57.165
Benjamin Kramer was imprisoned
for 1 0 months at Patin.

01:30:57.332 --> 01:31:01.002
You were responsible for the death
of his wife and daughters.

01:31:01.211 --> 01:31:05.674
My name is Arthur Denker.
I am an American.

01:31:05.882 --> 01:31:11.430
Don't bother. Your papers won't
stand up to serious examination.

01:31:12.514 --> 01:31:15.350
We have all we need here.

01:31:15.559 --> 01:31:19.688
I'm Dan Richler, FBl.
This is Detective Getty, LAPD.

01:31:19.855 --> 01:31:24.818
You know who I work for. When you're
strong enough you will be moved.

01:31:25.068 --> 01:31:28.447
Until then, this entire ward
will be under guard.

01:31:28.613 --> 01:31:33.285
You can expect to be in Jerusalem
by the end of the summer.

01:31:51.344 --> 01:31:56.391
- Where do you want us to sit?
- Anywhere but the front row.

01:31:56.558 --> 01:31:59.728
There's Carla.

01:31:59.936 --> 01:32:03.440
- Hi, Chelsea.
- Congratulations.

01:32:12.741 --> 01:32:16.411
- Hey, Todd.
- Mr. French.

01:32:16.578 --> 01:32:20.707
You did it. I knew you could.
I'm so proud of you.

01:32:20.874 --> 01:32:25.754
- These must be your parents.
- Dick Bowden.

01:32:25.921 --> 01:32:30.801
Your son really pulled one off.
You must be very proud.

01:32:30.967 --> 01:32:37.933
- Are you a teacher of Todd's?
- I'm his guidance counsellor.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:41.686
I was looking forward
to seeing your grandfather.

01:32:41.895 --> 01:32:46.066
It's a long trip from Charlotte.
He's been in a wheelchair for years.

01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:50.445
They don't get out much.
Usually Thanksgiving.

01:32:53.073 --> 01:32:57.077
I'm sorry ... I don't understand.

01:32:59.496 --> 01:33:03.834
- That's your cue.
- That's my cue.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.504
Nice to meet you.

01:33:10.841 --> 01:33:14.594
I don't feel so well.
Let's leave early.

01:33:14.845 --> 01:33:19.599
- Are you okay?
- It's probably nerves.

01:33:19.766 --> 01:33:21.810
Let's see how it goes.

01:33:25.897 --> 01:33:31.820
All great achievements
arose from dissatisfaction.

01:33:33.238 --> 01:33:37.409
It is the desire to do better,
to dig deeper, -

01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:41.705
- that propels a civilisation
to greatness.

01:33:41.872 --> 01:33:45.542
All of us
have heard the story of lkaros.

01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:49.212
The young boy who took
the wings his father built for him.

01:33:49.421 --> 01:33:53.175
Wings that were meant to carry him
over the ocean to freedom.

01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:59.347
He used them instead
for a joyride.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:13.487
For a brief moment lkaros felt
what it was like to live as a god.

01:34:14.362 --> 01:34:18.533
To touch the sun.
To soar above the common man.

01:34:19.659 --> 01:34:23.038
And for doing so
he paid the ultimate price.

01:34:24.748 --> 01:34:28.168
Come down to the cellar,
you won't believe this.

01:34:28.377 --> 01:34:31.880
Like lkaros,
we too have been given gifts:

01:34:32.047 --> 01:34:37.386
Knowledge, education, experience.

01:34:38.678 --> 01:34:42.432
And with these gifts
comes the responsibility of choice.

01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:46.228
We alone decide how our talents
are bestowed upon the world.

01:34:46.436 --> 01:34:52.067
This is our destiny, and we hold it
in the palm of our hands.

01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:55.672
An investigation by police, FBl,
and the Department of Justice, -

01:35:55.839 --> 01:36:01.344
- has uncovered a body
in the house of Arthur Denker, -

01:36:01.511 --> 01:36:06.475
- the man believed
to be a Nazi war criminal.

01:36:06.683 --> 01:36:09.519
Cause of death has been withheld.

01:36:09.686 --> 01:36:15.650
Identification of the body
is pending further investigation.

01:36:15.817 --> 01:36:20.363
The apprehension of Dussander
brings to a close a manhunt -

01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:24.367
- that has been underway
for 40 years in three continents.

01:36:35.670 --> 01:36:39.007
I'll be taking care of you now.

01:36:40.675 --> 01:36:44.346
Try to relax.

01:36:45.222 --> 01:36:49.684
I'm Dan Richler of the FBl,
and this is Dr. Weiskopf.

01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:53.438
I'd like to hear about
your involvement with Dussander.

01:36:53.605 --> 01:36:58.485
Actually, to you Arthur Denker.
How did you know him?

01:36:58.693 --> 01:37:03.115
- Do you feel up to this.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

01:37:10.205 --> 01:37:12.249
Here's the thing ...

01:37:12.416 --> 01:37:18.380
You said Denker had a heart attack
while you were reading him a letter.

01:37:18.547 --> 01:37:22.300
- Was it in English or German?
- German.

01:37:23.844 --> 01:37:26.596
- You speak German?
- No.

01:37:26.763 --> 01:37:33.353
- You had no idea what it said?
- No, but he seemed to understand.

01:37:39.401 --> 01:37:43.405
What we can't seem to figure out
is the letter, Todd.

01:37:43.572 --> 01:37:49.244
- Do you know where it is?
- I guess it's still on the table.

01:37:49.453 --> 01:37:56.043
Then it should still be there.
Did you see it, Mr. Bowden?

01:37:56.251 --> 01:38:00.589
No, I wasn't looking for a letter.
I was concerned about Todd.

01:38:00.756 --> 01:38:05.135
- Maybe somebody took it.
- Why would somebody steal a letter?

01:38:05.302 --> 01:38:11.266
Unless they wanted to protect him.
Another fugitive.

01:38:11.475 --> 01:38:14.978
I know all this sounds
like Robert Ludlum, -

01:38:15.187 --> 01:38:22.444
- but while Dussander was in the
hospital someone swiped the letter.

01:38:22.652 --> 01:38:27.407
- That doesn't make sense.
- Why not?

01:38:28.325 --> 01:38:33.205
If he had an old Nazi buddy in town,
why didn't he read the letter?

01:38:33.413 --> 01:38:36.416
Maybe he's crippled or blind.

01:38:36.583 --> 01:38:41.713
Guys that are blind don't normally
go scooting out to steal letters.

01:38:43.131 --> 01:38:47.636
Did he ever talk about his past?

01:38:50.472 --> 01:38:53.183
No.

01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:58.814
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I'm a school teacher.

01:38:59.815 --> 01:39:03.402
Dr. Weiskopf is a professor
at the Judaic lnstitute in Munich.

01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:09.366
He assists the lsraeli Government
in certain matters.

01:39:45.485 --> 01:39:49.531
Hey, buddy, are you okay?

01:39:49.698 --> 01:39:53.535
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

01:39:56.621 --> 01:40:01.960
I just can't believe it.
Even after what those guys told me.

01:40:02.127 --> 01:40:06.173
Your mother and I
feel like we let you down.

01:40:06.339 --> 01:40:13.221
- It's not your fault.
- We're going to talk to a lawyer.

01:40:13.388 --> 01:40:18.852
It's nothing to worry about.
I just don't trust these cops.

01:40:19.019 --> 01:40:21.646
I think that's a good idea.

01:40:21.813 --> 01:40:26.318
Your old man's on top of this.
I'll take care of this.

01:40:29.446 --> 01:40:31.990
Dad ...

01:40:32.199 --> 01:40:37.788
- I never knew anything about this.
- I never thought you did.

01:40:37.954 --> 01:40:42.918
- I know.
- See you later.

01:40:48.799 --> 01:40:54.262
- Will you talk to the boy again?
- I don't think so.

01:40:54.471 --> 01:40:58.558
Somehow he didn't even ...

01:40:58.725 --> 01:41:04.314
When you were a boy,
what did you do for fun?

01:41:05.524 --> 01:41:08.527
I went to the movies.

01:41:08.693 --> 01:41:14.491
- What did you do?
- I used to chase girls.

01:41:16.827 --> 01:41:20.330
And now I chase old men.

01:41:49.025 --> 01:41:56.241
This is the hospital administrator
and his chief of staff.

01:41:57.367 --> 01:42:01.038
- Do we have a plan?
- They've arranged an exit for us.

01:42:13.216 --> 01:42:17.721
Mr. French, what are you doing here?

01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:31.860
- Are your parents home?
- No. What is it about?

01:42:32.069 --> 01:42:36.698
- That's between me and them.
- Why isn't it between you and me?

01:42:38.742 --> 01:42:42.329
Do you want to tell me
what happened?

01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:47.310
Turn him on his left side.

01:43:50.147 --> 01:43:54.776
- I wouldn't know where to begin.
- You have to tell me something.

01:43:56.653 --> 01:44:01.616
I can tell you it would be better
if we both forget about it.

01:44:01.825 --> 01:44:05.412
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:19.176
Tell your parents
I'll be back to see them later.

01:44:19.342 --> 01:44:23.180
Mr. French ...

01:44:23.388 --> 01:44:27.434
I thought we had a deal here.
"The world will open up for you."

01:44:27.601 --> 01:44:32.647
- You want me to forget about this?
- I want to get on with my life.

01:44:32.856 --> 01:44:39.654
It was a mistake to come here.
I'll do this over the phone.

01:44:43.992 --> 01:44:49.498
Hey, Ed? Can I call you Ed, now
that I'm out of your fucking school?

01:44:54.711 --> 01:44:59.591
Does it ever work?
Or am I the first one?

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.845
If I'm the first, I'm flattered,
but I don't believe that.

01:45:04.012 --> 01:45:10.185
Not after you fixing my grades.
Giving me your home phone number.

01:45:10.352 --> 01:45:14.439
You've got some balls!

01:45:14.606 --> 01:45:18.527
Is this why your wife left you?

01:45:24.533 --> 01:45:28.537
You must really have wanted
to shake my hand or something else.

01:45:28.704 --> 01:45:32.541
Are you going to tell people
I did something to you?

01:45:32.749 --> 01:45:35.877
I'll drag you down with me.

01:45:36.044 --> 01:45:41.466
- I'm better at this than you are.
- I'm trying to help you.

01:45:41.633 --> 01:45:45.053
- I won't just do nothing.
- You're going to fucking have to!

01:45:49.599 --> 01:45:56.732
The things I'm going to say,
they'll never go away.

01:45:58.692 --> 01:46:04.364
Think of your job.
Think of your son.

01:46:21.298 --> 01:46:26.845
What's the story here, Ed?
Do we have a deal?

01:46:33.435 --> 01:46:37.272
You can't do this, Todd.

01:46:37.481 --> 01:46:40.233
You have no idea what I can do.

01:51:03.372 --> 01:51:07.709
