02:12.560 --> 02:16.393
You will leave every ounce
of all you got on that floor.

03:29.660 --> 03:31.263

03:32.160 --> 03:35.420
I seen Stoney talking
to Tywan the other day.

03:35.420 --> 03:36.253
- What?

03:36.253 --> 03:38.763
- Yeah, he gave him his
card and everything.

03:39.630 --> 03:42.133
- So, sniffing around my players again?

03:43.396 --> 03:44.396
- It looks that way.

03:45.315 --> 03:47.380
- Alright, well don't worry
about it, I'll talk to him.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.880
- Okay, well make sure you do,

03:48.880 --> 03:51.340
'cause we can't afford
to lose any of our guys.

03:51.340 --> 03:54.610
- I know man, look, I'ma
talk to him, alright Randy.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.443
- Alright.

04:01.737 --> 04:03.390
- Hey baby.

04:03.390 --> 04:04.223
- [Dylan] Hey.

04:04.223 --> 04:05.056
- How was your day?

04:06.916 --> 04:09.245
It was good til about an hour ago.

04:09.245 --> 04:10.713
- What happened?

04:14.810 --> 04:18.290
- Stoney is sniffing round my boys again.

04:18.290 --> 04:19.123
- Again?

04:20.579 --> 04:21.413
- Yep.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.570
Randy said he saw him talking to Tywan.

04:25.940 --> 04:27.680
- Dylan, don't worry about that.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.240
Look, Tywan and the rest of those boys,

04:30.240 --> 04:32.020
they know who has their back,

04:32.020 --> 04:34.070
and who has their best interest at heart.

04:35.770 --> 04:37.540
Honey, I see the way you always ripping

04:37.540 --> 04:38.710
and running around trying to make sure

04:38.710 --> 04:40.110
they have everything they need.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.340
And you stay on the phone
with the college coaches

04:42.340 --> 04:45.470
and scouts trying to get them recognition.

04:45.470 --> 04:46.590
But most of all you are there

04:46.590 --> 04:48.920
for them whenever they need you.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.380
So if they don't see that and
if they don't appreciate it,

04:53.380 --> 04:54.533
then I say let 'em go.

04:56.740 --> 04:58.160
- Yeah, you're right.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.013
- Dylan, please don't stress about this.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.960
- I'm not stressing.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.880
It's just that every year,
I get these boys together

05:11.880 --> 05:13.480
and start working on their game.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.830
And when I get them tapping
into their full potential,

05:17.830 --> 05:20.890
here comes Stoney, flashing
them sweet gym shoes

05:20.890 --> 05:23.100
and trying to sell 'em pipe dreams,

05:23.100 --> 05:24.750
and making these false promises.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.933
- Dylan, you can't worry about that stuff.

05:28.884 --> 05:32.390
All you can do is what you can do,

05:32.390 --> 05:33.973
and let God do the rest.

05:34.940 --> 05:36.640
Honey, what He has for you is for you

05:36.640 --> 05:40.100
and nobody can take that away
from you, no matter what.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.153
Not even Stoney.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.098
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

05:46.098 --> 05:47.618
- Aren't I always?

05:47.618 --> 05:50.280
(laughs)

05:50.280 --> 05:54.210
- Yeah and how's my baby
boy doing in there today?

05:54.210 --> 05:55.423
- He's doing great.

05:56.465 --> 05:58.490
You know, he's moving around a lot.

05:58.490 --> 05:59.760
I don't know what I ate,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.710
but whatever it was, he didn't like it.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.600
- Hey little man, you stop giving

06:05.600 --> 06:07.273
your Mama problems in there.

06:08.275 --> 06:09.530
Now there's a lesson you know.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.143
You working on that spin move.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.833
I love you baby.

06:15.670 --> 06:16.520
- I love you too.

06:17.810 --> 06:21.081
- I can't believe I'm about to be a daddy.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.414
- I know, right.

06:23.501 --> 06:27.550
You are going to be such a great daddy.

06:27.550 --> 06:28.583
The best.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.860
(lips smack)

06:30.860 --> 06:31.693
- I can't wait.

06:33.579 --> 06:35.662
(laughs)

06:38.055 --> 06:40.638
(gentle music)

06:46.275 --> 06:48.942
(hip hop music)

06:57.640 --> 06:58.473
- Hey Ma.

06:59.329 --> 07:00.162
- Uh-huh.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.210
What are you doing?

07:05.410 --> 07:06.243
- Nothing.

07:09.194 --> 07:11.194
- That's what I thought.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.153
Now come on up over here and
run up to that store for me.

07:17.517 --> 07:18.350
- Why Ma?

07:18.350 --> 07:20.703
You already been drinking
and I got homework.

07:22.070 --> 07:23.863
- Boy, don't you talk back to me.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.840
I'm the grown up.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.563
And I pay all the bills up in here, okay?

07:33.830 --> 07:36.880
So if you wanna continue enjoying

07:36.880 --> 07:39.233
the comforts of my home,

07:42.020 --> 07:43.520
then do what I tell you to do.

07:48.107 --> 07:50.857
I don't know why you talking
about no homework any way,

07:52.210 --> 07:53.610
because you're dumb as hell.

07:57.065 --> 08:00.187
It ain't like you're going
to college or nothing.

08:03.780 --> 08:08.383
Get yo stupid butt up, and go
to the store and get my stuff.

08:22.932 --> 08:24.932
(sighs)

08:27.881 --> 08:30.464
(gentle music)

08:47.633 --> 08:50.800
(basketball bouncing)

09:05.520 --> 09:09.020
- See you been working on
your form like I showed you.

09:09.020 --> 09:09.853
- Yeah Dad.

09:10.889 --> 09:12.620
- Good, the Coach said
there's a few scouts

09:12.620 --> 09:14.973
that wanna offer you off for visits,

09:14.973 --> 09:16.840
so I'm gonna take some time
off so we can go together.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.673
- Okay Dad.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.483
- How's practice?

09:26.160 --> 09:27.560
- It was good.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.190

09:29.190 --> 09:30.410

09:30.410 --> 09:32.950
we gotta make sure you put
up some impressive numbers,

09:32.950 --> 09:34.680
so those scouts will take notice.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.513
- Yes, sir.

09:37.432 --> 09:38.463
- Don't stay out too late.

09:45.530 --> 09:48.033
- Alright, come on Red,
move your feet, come on.

09:49.671 --> 09:52.070
Alright back up top, back up top.

09:52.070 --> 09:55.440
Red, will you stop reaching

09:55.440 --> 09:56.453
Come on man.

09:58.420 --> 09:59.470
Set it up, set it up.

10:00.610 --> 10:02.559
- [Player] Go, go, go.

10:02.559 --> 10:04.309
Hey, hey, wait, wait.

10:06.547 --> 10:07.380
- Alright, alright, come on, come on.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.596
Set it back up, set it back up.

10:09.596 --> 10:10.810
Hey, switch it 2-3, 2-3.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.363
No man, no man, 2-3, come on.

10:16.108 --> 10:17.487
(whistle blows)

10:17.487 --> 10:19.300
Hey, you two get over here, get over here.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.793
Tywan, Mike, get over here now.

10:25.110 --> 10:27.947
What seems to be the problem with you two?

10:27.947 --> 10:29.270
Did y'all forget you're on the same team?

10:29.270 --> 10:30.610
- You ball hogging, Coach.

10:30.610 --> 10:32.200
Give me the ball, I'm wide open.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.913
- Maybe if you would catch the ball

10:33.913 --> 10:35.631
once in a while when I do pass it to you,

10:35.631 --> 10:36.903
you would get it more often.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.195
- Hey, hey, hey, knock it off, let's go.

10:39.195 --> 10:40.099
(whistle blows)

10:40.099 --> 10:42.860
On the line, on the
line, let's go, come on.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.828
On the line, let's go fellas, now.

10:44.828 --> 10:47.828
- That's what I'm talking about man.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.623
- Fellas, we are a team here.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.400
And it appears to me that some

10:54.400 --> 10:56.543
of you guys don't understand that concept.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.330
We got a scrimmage tomorrow,

11:00.330 --> 11:03.996
and I am not gonna be
embarrassed, you understand?

11:03.996 --> 11:04.967
- [All] Yes Coach.

11:04.967 --> 11:05.847
- Huh?

11:05.847 --> 11:07.520
- [All] Yes Coach.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.120
- So until you guys get
in your thick skulls

11:10.959 --> 11:12.959
what it means to be a team, we will run.

11:14.110 --> 11:15.910
You will not touch a ball,

11:15.910 --> 11:18.790
and you will run until I get tired.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.480
Is that understood?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.380
- [All] Yes Coach.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.260
- Thanks a lot girls.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.920
- What was that?

11:24.920 --> 11:25.783
- Nothing Coach.

11:26.949 --> 11:28.021
- Let's go.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.688
(whistle blows)

11:35.991 --> 11:37.991
(sighs)

11:40.900 --> 11:41.800
- Something funny?

11:44.604 --> 11:45.543
- Yeah, man.

11:47.950 --> 11:49.840
Nice shoes, what did you do,

11:49.840 --> 11:51.355
kick rocks all the way over here?

11:51.355 --> 11:52.444
- Oh, one more time.

11:52.444 --> 11:54.438
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:54.438 --> 11:56.427
(shouting over each other)

11:56.427 --> 11:57.964
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, back off!

11:57.964 --> 11:59.041
- Get off me man.

11:59.041 --> 11:59.874
- Chill out bro.

11:59.874 --> 12:01.316
- You two wait right here.

12:01.316 --> 12:03.066
Everybody else get outta here, now!

12:04.407 --> 12:05.240
Let's go.

12:07.405 --> 12:10.322
(lockers slamming)

12:15.146 --> 12:18.030
Now you two been playing with
me for over two years now.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.250
And you know I'm not gonna tolerate

12:19.250 --> 12:22.670
this type of behavior on
this team, understood?

12:22.670 --> 12:23.503
- [Both] Yes Coach.

12:24.770 --> 12:27.160
- We're a family here fellas.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.010
And we treat each other with respect.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.680
This is a team.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.233
So if your brother don't
shine, you don't shine.

12:35.540 --> 12:38.020
We all got a role here to play.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.603
So we all can shine together.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.330
All this on and off the court
beef you two got going on.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.450
It stops right here, right now.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.279
Is that understood?

12:49.279 --> 12:50.533
- [Mike] Yeah.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.650
- Is that understood?

12:54.650 --> 12:55.483
- Yeah whatever.

13:07.230 --> 13:09.250
- Look, I'm sorry Coach.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.800
- Look Mike, don't say it
if you don't mean it man.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.500
- He just can't stand the
fact that I'm better than him.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.630
- So what makes you think
you're better than him Mike?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.673
Listen, don't think I don't
see what's going on out there.

13:21.890 --> 13:24.300
Yes, you are the leader
when you're out there.

13:24.300 --> 13:27.430
But you also gotta remember
you are part of a team.

13:27.430 --> 13:29.633
You can't win these
games by yourself Mike.

13:31.290 --> 13:34.303
And I you keep trying to be a
glory hog, you're gonna fail.

13:35.295 --> 13:37.653
You know that pride comes
before the fall, man.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.920
You will get to where
you're trying to get to,

13:41.920 --> 13:44.120
I have not doubt about it.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.140
But don't try to get there by stepping

13:46.140 --> 13:47.803
on the backs of your teammates.

13:49.300 --> 13:52.510
- Look, I just wanna be the best.

13:52.510 --> 13:53.770
- Mike.

13:53.770 --> 13:57.483
Sometimes being the best,
means doing what's best man.

13:59.063 --> 14:01.646
(gentle music)

14:10.880 --> 14:14.153
- T, hold up man, let me
talk to you for a minute.

14:15.792 --> 14:17.573
What's going on with you man?

14:18.570 --> 14:19.530
- Nothing, I'm just tired of him

14:19.530 --> 14:21.280
running his mouth all the time.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.780
He always got something smart to say.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.617
- Man, don't let him bother you like that.

14:25.617 --> 14:27.413
You're better than that man.

14:28.930 --> 14:30.913
Look, what's really going on with you?

14:31.870 --> 14:34.730
I ain't never seen you
pop off like that before.

14:34.730 --> 14:36.683
- Nothing Coach, I'm good.

14:39.150 --> 14:42.452
- Randy said he saw you talking
to Stoney the other day.

14:42.452 --> 14:44.393
What's that all about?

14:45.270 --> 14:47.498
You thinking about making a move?

14:47.498 --> 14:48.870
- No.

14:48.870 --> 14:50.470
- Would you tell me if you were?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.890
Look, T.

14:54.890 --> 14:56.440
I just want you to be
able to come and talk

14:56.440 --> 15:00.083
to me about anything, not
just basketball, anything.

15:01.853 --> 15:04.340
I mean if it's your grades, if it's girls,

15:04.340 --> 15:07.590
whatever, I just want you to
be able to come talk to me,

15:07.590 --> 15:09.143
man to man, friend to friend.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.342
Look man, I know how Stoney operates man,

15:14.342 --> 15:16.720
and I just want you to know man,

15:16.720 --> 15:19.423
the grass ain't always
greener on the other side.

15:20.690 --> 15:24.203
But if you ever feel like
this ain't the team for you,

15:25.195 --> 15:27.283
I just ask that you come let me know.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.823
That's all, alright?

15:30.690 --> 15:31.543
- Alright Coach.

15:33.270 --> 15:35.863
- Okay, I ain't gonna
hold you up any longer.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.530
You need a ride home?

15:38.530 --> 15:39.630
- No, my Mom's coming.

15:42.110 --> 15:44.674
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

15:44.674 --> 15:45.674
- Yeah okay.

15:47.755 --> 15:49.755
(sighs)

16:05.011 --> 16:06.760
(phone ringing)

16:06.760 --> 16:08.433
- [Voicemail] Please leave your message.

16:20.566 --> 16:22.201
- Know what we're gonna do today?

16:22.201 --> 16:24.057
(commentator chattering)

16:24.057 --> 16:24.890
- I think.

16:24.890 --> 16:25.723
(mumbles)

16:25.723 --> 16:26.911
- I think we should do.

16:26.911 --> 16:28.860
(mumbles)

16:28.860 --> 16:30.833
Hey, how was practice?

16:32.872 --> 16:33.930
- It was good.

16:33.930 --> 16:35.465
Hey Ma.

16:35.465 --> 16:36.843
- [Renee] Hey.

16:36.843 --> 16:38.296
- I'll be coming to
your scrimmage tomorrow.

16:38.296 --> 16:39.180
I wanna see how things are coming along.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.200
- Okay Dad.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.870
- Honey, you hungry?

16:41.870 --> 16:42.860
- No, I'm alright.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.250
I think I'ma just go upstairs,

16:44.250 --> 16:46.500
take a shower and go to sleep.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.350
I'm pretty tired.

16:50.647 --> 16:51.500
- What?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.100
Aren't you forgetting something?

16:54.832 --> 16:56.770
- Can't I just do it in the morning?

16:56.770 --> 16:59.230
- You think I got to be
an all-state champion

16:59.230 --> 17:01.460
with a division one scholarship
to play college ball,

17:01.460 --> 17:03.560
'cause I put things off until the morning?

17:04.780 --> 17:05.623
No I didn't.

17:07.196 --> 17:09.030
Now shoot those free throws
and then you can go to bed.

17:09.030 --> 17:10.740
- David, let the boy go to bed.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.720
- No, no Renee, he needs to understand,

17:12.720 --> 17:15.569
if he wants to go the distance
he has to put in the work.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.087
You wanna play college ball, right?

17:24.654 --> 17:27.609
(clanking)

17:27.609 --> 17:28.502
That's my boy.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.666
(upbeat music)

17:34.666 --> 17:37.583
(distant shouting)

17:42.860 --> 17:44.552
- Yeah, good job T, baby.

17:44.552 --> 17:46.519
Good job boy, yeah that's right,

17:46.519 --> 17:47.352
now get back, get back.

17:52.180 --> 17:54.070
Oh good shot, dang.

17:54.070 --> 17:56.651
Alright, come on, come on, come on.

17:56.651 --> 17:57.603
Run the play Mike, run it Mike, come on.

17:58.519 --> 17:59.872
Mike, set it up, set it up.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.490
Come on Mike, set it up.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.940
Alright Mike, alright,
set it up Mike, set it up.

18:07.875 --> 18:08.708
Mike!

18:10.497 --> 18:12.497
Come on fellas, come on.

18:14.078 --> 18:14.911
Team.

18:19.379 --> 18:20.796
Alright, come on.

18:24.835 --> 18:27.616
Alright, alright, run White
this time Mike, come on baby.

18:27.616 --> 18:29.366
Set it up, set it up.

18:32.985 --> 18:36.150
Mike, I just told you,
no forced shots man!

18:36.150 --> 18:38.400
(cheering)

18:39.545 --> 18:41.670
Do it again, run it again,
run it again, run it again.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.439
You had Dewey right open in the corner!

18:43.439 --> 18:44.906
Come on, use your team man.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.656
Mike, run the play, run the play.

18:55.966 --> 18:58.216
(clapping)

19:04.635 --> 19:07.552
(distant shouting)

19:09.789 --> 19:11.616
(whistle blows)

19:11.616 --> 19:13.560
Run the play, come on now.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.012
Time out, time out, time out.

19:16.012 --> 19:18.940
Time out, time out, time out!

19:18.940 --> 19:20.107
Get over here.

19:23.190 --> 19:25.768
(whistle blows)

19:25.768 --> 19:27.315
Warriors on three fellas, one, two, three.

19:27.315 --> 19:28.274
- [All] Warriors!

19:28.274 --> 19:30.764
- Good job, good job boys.

19:30.764 --> 19:31.630
- What happened out there?

19:31.630 --> 19:33.997
- I don't know man, he
took me out, I was on.

19:33.997 --> 19:35.840
- That's what I saw, I'll
handle it, don't worry.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.620
Coach, yo man, good game.

19:38.620 --> 19:39.940
- Hey.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.020
- I couldn't help but notice
that you took Mike out

19:42.020 --> 19:44.040
after that pivotal three.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.310
What was up with that?

19:45.310 --> 19:47.927
- Well, he was told to run a certain play,

19:47.927 --> 19:50.720
and he chose to do what he wanted to do.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.890
So I put someone in who I
felt would get the job done.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.199
- I see, but--

19:55.199 --> 19:56.970
- David, listen.

19:56.970 --> 20:00.000
Now, you know I respect your opinion.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.770
And I welcome your feedback,

20:01.770 --> 20:03.690
but right after a game is not a good time

20:03.690 --> 20:05.993
to talk to me about
your son's playing time.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.750
Look, I'll be more than happy to talk

20:08.750 --> 20:10.973
to you tomorrow after practice, okay?

20:12.595 --> 20:14.980
- Tomorrow then.

20:14.980 --> 20:15.840
- Thank you.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.673
- No, thank you.

20:18.363 --> 20:19.196
See ya.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.316
- Players don't worry about shoes.

20:22.316 --> 20:23.791
(mumbles)

20:23.791 --> 20:25.504
The name's Infinity Squad.

20:25.504 --> 20:27.020
We take care of our players,

20:27.020 --> 20:29.320
we got money to move around
and make things happen,

20:29.320 --> 20:32.247
you're a great player,
good game out there.`

20:32.247 --> 20:33.507
- Hey, hey, hey, go ahead,
go ahead to the car fellas.

20:34.928 --> 20:36.490
- [Stoney] We all need
to see that, real life.

20:38.514 --> 20:40.608
I just wanna let you know

20:40.608 --> 20:41.557
(mumbles)

20:41.557 --> 20:43.261
we make sure we take care of our players.

20:43.261 --> 20:44.637
Hey Coach, just telling my man, T-Money,

20:44.637 --> 20:46.973
what a great game he
had, ain't that right, T?

20:48.802 --> 20:50.793
- Yeah, Coach can we go now.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.400
- Yeah T, go ahead to the
car, I'll be right behind you.

20:57.446 --> 21:00.529
(distant chattering)

21:01.410 --> 21:03.530
So you sniffing around my players, huh?

21:03.530 --> 21:06.090
- Hey, no need for the hostility man,

21:06.090 --> 21:07.250
I'm just telling the boy what

21:07.250 --> 21:09.617
a good game he had, that's all.

21:10.994 --> 21:12.944
- You stay away from my players Stoney.

21:15.501 --> 21:17.751
(laughing)

21:22.672 --> 21:24.839
- You did real good today.

21:25.740 --> 21:26.573
- Thanks.

21:27.830 --> 21:30.948
- I'm gonna talk to your
Coach about your playing time.

21:30.948 --> 21:32.930
- Dad, you don't have to do that.

21:32.930 --> 21:35.727
- No, he needs to understand
that if he wants to win,

21:35.727 --> 21:37.793
he needs his best player on the court.

21:39.350 --> 21:40.900
He's not allowing you the flexibility

21:40.900 --> 21:43.013
that you need to play your game.

21:43.013 --> 21:43.893
- Okay.

21:47.254 --> 21:50.233
- This your last year at AAU,
you gotta make sure you shine.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.890
- Good game today man.

21:57.890 --> 21:59.330
- [Tywan] Thanks Coach.

21:59.330 --> 22:01.090
- Hey, don't forget to remind

22:01.090 --> 22:03.260
your Mom about the
parent meeting tomorrow.

22:03.260 --> 22:04.690
It's very important that she comes.

22:04.690 --> 22:05.523
- Okay.

22:06.380 --> 22:09.123
- So, how's summer school coming along?

22:09.960 --> 22:11.550
- It's going pretty good.

22:11.550 --> 22:13.010
I got all of my assignments turned in,

22:13.010 --> 22:16.900
so as long as I do good on
my tests I should be alright.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.710
- Okay, well you know
I'm gonna be checking

22:18.710 --> 22:20.980
in with your teachers, right?

22:20.980 --> 22:21.813
Okay?

22:21.813 --> 22:22.646
- Alright.

22:23.710 --> 22:28.480
- Alright, well hey, you're
going into senior year man,

22:28.480 --> 22:31.640
so if you finish summer school strong,

22:31.640 --> 22:34.880
then you get your GPA back
on track with college,

22:34.880 --> 22:36.240
You know I been pulling a lot of strings

22:36.240 --> 22:38.518
with these college
coaches coming to see you

22:38.518 --> 22:39.813
with your grades the way they've been?

22:40.682 --> 22:41.515
- Mm-hmm.

22:41.515 --> 22:44.480
- But, if you keep working
hard, and get a good ACT,

22:45.332 --> 22:48.250
you've got a lot of
schools to choose from.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.030
They're really calling about you man.

22:50.030 --> 22:50.900
- Really?

22:50.900 --> 22:55.830
- Yeah, so stay focused
and keep working, alright?

22:55.830 --> 22:56.663
- Alright.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.823
- Hey, tell your Mom
about the parent meeting.

23:00.823 --> 23:02.634
- Alright, I will Coach.

23:02.634 --> 23:03.533
- See you tomorrow.

23:03.533 --> 23:04.483
- See you tomorrow.

23:08.799 --> 23:11.382
(gentle music)

23:16.478 --> 23:19.478
(crickets chirping)

23:23.790 --> 23:24.623
- Hey Coach.

23:26.390 --> 23:27.223
Yeah.

23:28.170 --> 23:30.320
Yeah, Tywan had a really
good game tonight.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.410
Yeah, I'm glad you were there to see it.

23:35.090 --> 23:38.090
Okay Coach, alright I'll talk to you soon.

23:38.090 --> 23:39.407
Okay, bye-bye.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.133
- Hey.

23:42.133 --> 23:42.966
- Hey baby.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.365
(lips smacking)

23:45.365 --> 23:46.290
What you reading?

23:46.290 --> 23:50.094
- Beautiful Rage, the break
of dawn, by Janaya Black.

23:50.094 --> 23:50.927
- Mm.

23:50.927 --> 23:52.502
- It's really crazy so don't ask.

23:52.502 --> 23:55.060
(laughing)

23:55.060 --> 23:56.560
So how did the scrimmage go?

23:56.560 --> 24:00.821
- Oh, that Tywan, he had
a great game tonight.

24:00.821 --> 24:01.720
- Really?

24:01.720 --> 24:04.556
- Those coaches were on
the phone, from state.

24:04.556 --> 24:06.800
He was there to see another player,

24:06.800 --> 24:08.350
called me about Tywan.

24:08.350 --> 24:09.370
- Really?

24:09.370 --> 24:12.750
That's great you know, I think
Tywan is really a nice kid.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.554
- Oh yeah, no he is.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.137
He's just has it a little rough right now.

24:17.137 --> 24:19.960
You know, his Mom's
raising him by herself,

24:19.960 --> 24:23.020
and from the looks of it, she seems to be

24:23.020 --> 24:25.820
a little too pre-occupied
with other things.

24:25.820 --> 24:28.150
And it's really starting
to make him suffer.

24:28.150 --> 24:30.540
- What do you mean by pre-occupied.

24:30.540 --> 24:32.570
- Well, it's like every time I seem her,

24:32.570 --> 24:34.590
she's either drunk or high.

24:34.590 --> 24:35.423
- Oh wow.

24:35.423 --> 24:37.100
- And she never has any money for him.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.723
I mean we got a scholarship and all,

24:41.723 --> 24:45.320
but I mean, like today, I seen him,

24:45.320 --> 24:46.970
his shoes are just falling apart.

24:48.157 --> 24:52.320
I mean, I ask him all the
time, "Do you need anything?"

24:52.320 --> 24:53.730
He always tells me, "No."

24:53.730 --> 24:56.506
- Well he's probably
ashamed to tell you that.

24:56.506 --> 24:59.423
- Yeah, you're probably right about that.

25:00.674 --> 25:02.893
Tomorrow I'm gonna go get him some shoes.

25:03.807 --> 25:07.310
I mean, I can't have
him out there in shoes

25:07.310 --> 25:10.810
that's falling apart and
turn his ankle or anything.

25:10.810 --> 25:14.737
And then I overheard Mike
clowning him the other day.

25:14.737 --> 25:15.890
- Are you serious?

25:15.890 --> 25:17.414
- Yeah.

25:17.414 --> 25:19.106
(sighs)

25:19.106 --> 25:20.833
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with that boy.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.453
I mean he's a good ball player.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.620
He's actually really good.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.650
But, you know, his dad's got him thinking

25:27.650 --> 25:29.173
he's a one man show.

25:30.674 --> 25:31.780
He had the nerve to come to me after

25:31.780 --> 25:35.129
the game today, asked
me why I pulled his son.

25:35.129 --> 25:36.070
(laughing)

25:36.070 --> 25:37.930
- So you let him have it right?

25:37.930 --> 25:41.760
- No, I just told him he
can come talk to me after

25:41.760 --> 25:44.123
the parent meeting right
after the practice tomorrow.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.487
And baby, sometimes these parents

25:47.487 --> 25:49.260
make me just wanna lose it.

25:49.260 --> 25:50.243
- Oh Dylan.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.200
Honey, you're not gonna lose it.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.263
And do you know why?

25:57.090 --> 25:59.530
- 'Cause I don't wanna
go to jail, that's why.

25:59.530 --> 26:03.523
- No, because you're doing God's work.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.980
Dylan for the past eight
years, I have watched you Coach

26:07.980 --> 26:10.210
and mentor different groups of boys,

26:10.210 --> 26:12.880
and so many of them have
gone on to do great things.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.250
Why?

26:14.250 --> 26:16.593
Because you took the time to care.

26:17.830 --> 26:21.033
You've been a father to some
and a friend to all of them.

26:25.490 --> 26:28.323
It takes a special man to do that.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.950
- So I'm special, huh?

26:31.950 --> 26:32.860
- Yes you are.

26:32.860 --> 26:34.810
- Special enough to get that--

26:34.810 --> 26:36.540
- Not a chance, oh no.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.070
- Come on.
- I'm not cooking tonight.

26:38.070 --> 26:40.240
- What, come on, are you serious?

26:40.240 --> 26:41.073
- Very.

26:41.930 --> 26:44.483
- Oh my, mm-hmm.

26:46.377 --> 26:47.577
- Good evening, parents.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.520
How you doing tonight?

26:51.520 --> 26:54.730
This is Coach Randy, and
what he's passing out

26:54.730 --> 26:56.330
is the schedule for this summer.

26:57.205 --> 26:59.140
I know it's a little aggressive,

26:59.140 --> 27:03.220
but with this being their last AAU season,

27:03.220 --> 27:05.670
we want to get them as
much exposure as possible.

27:06.940 --> 27:09.893
What you will also find in
there is the payment schedule.

27:11.390 --> 27:13.810
Now, those of you played with us before,

27:13.810 --> 27:16.350
and I can't express this enough,

27:16.350 --> 27:20.820
it's very important that you
get your payments paid on time.

27:20.820 --> 27:23.300
These tournaments have to
be paid for in advance,

27:23.300 --> 27:26.240
so if you don't make that payment on time,

27:26.240 --> 27:28.853
it creates a lot of problems, okay?

27:31.340 --> 27:34.360
Now, if you can't make
that payment on time,

27:34.360 --> 27:37.613
just please come and
talk to me, let me know.

27:38.610 --> 27:40.217
Do you have any questions?

27:40.217 --> 27:43.525
- Are there gonna be any
more fundraisers this year?

27:43.525 --> 27:46.147
- Yes, we are.

27:46.147 --> 27:48.960
And Coach Randy will getting
with you to let you know.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.490
- What about playing time?

27:50.490 --> 27:52.380
I don't wanna drive four hours,

27:52.380 --> 27:54.764
just to see my son play for five minutes.

27:54.764 --> 27:56.430
- Now, that's a good question.

27:56.430 --> 27:57.310
- Listen...

27:59.120 --> 28:04.020
This is competitive
basketball, not reg ball, okay?

28:04.020 --> 28:05.730
We're here to teach your kids

28:05.730 --> 28:06.860
how to play the game of basketball,

28:06.860 --> 28:09.470
and help prepare them for college.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.617
Our motto here is, work hard, get better.

28:12.617 --> 28:16.100
Those who work the hardest
and play the smartest,

28:16.100 --> 28:19.593
will be rewarded with playing
time, it's that simple.

28:21.690 --> 28:23.140
Is there any other questions?

28:26.420 --> 28:29.980
Okay, I appreciate you
guys coming out tonight.

28:29.980 --> 28:33.200
And we'll see you guys
at the game next weekend.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.940
Alright, thank you.

28:38.340 --> 28:40.870
- [David] Coach, Coach Dylan?

28:40.870 --> 28:42.460
- Yes?

28:42.460 --> 28:44.170
- I wanted to follow up
with that conversation

28:44.170 --> 28:45.824
that we had yesterday.

28:45.824 --> 28:47.090
- Yes, what's on your mind?

28:47.090 --> 28:49.205
- Erm, I'm feeling like Mike

28:49.205 --> 28:52.023
is being held back from playing his game.

28:52.970 --> 28:54.013
- How so, David?

28:55.699 --> 28:57.883
- Okay, let's say for instance yesterday.

28:58.930 --> 29:01.787
He hit a three at a
crucial point in the game,

29:01.787 --> 29:05.310
and you took him out, I
didn't understand that.

29:05.310 --> 29:08.110
- Yes, he did hit a three in
a crucial part of the game.

29:08.950 --> 29:11.910
But, he also was being
a ball hog and showboat,

29:11.910 --> 29:14.113
when I asked him to run a specific play.

29:15.012 --> 29:15.990
(laughs)

29:15.990 --> 29:17.389
- A ball hog?

29:17.389 --> 29:19.270
I really don't think
that's a fair assessment

29:19.270 --> 29:21.780
of what my son's been doing,

29:21.780 --> 29:23.650
he's been taking control of the game.

29:23.650 --> 29:27.420
- David, the boy was being
guarded by two defenders,

29:27.420 --> 29:30.530
he had a man wide open and
he chose to just keep trying

29:30.530 --> 29:32.980
to score, because he was
trying to impress you.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.893
I saw him looking the stands at you.

29:36.180 --> 29:38.810
- So are you saying my son is not allowed

29:38.810 --> 29:40.820
to showcase his skills?

29:40.820 --> 29:44.450
- What am I saying is,
he's a part of the team,

29:44.450 --> 29:47.750
and I'm the Coach, if I
ask him to do something,

29:47.750 --> 29:49.300
that's what I expect him to do.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.680
Look David, your son is a leader

29:52.680 --> 29:54.710
when he's out there on the floor.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.860
I need him to be able
to follow directions.

29:58.000 --> 29:58.833
- Hmm.

29:59.690 --> 30:04.230
- Look David, I know what
you want for your son man.

30:04.230 --> 30:07.650
I want that for him and all
these other boys out there too.

30:07.650 --> 30:09.710
But they gotta go about
doing it the right way,

30:09.710 --> 30:11.043
or else we all lose.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.055
Look, look, I'm sorry man.

30:20.055 --> 30:22.290
I gotta get ready for
practice, but if you wanna--

30:22.290 --> 30:23.857
- No, no, no, we're fine.

30:23.857 --> 30:25.363
I hear you loud and clear.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.593
- Marie, Marie?

30:33.950 --> 30:35.953
Hey, thanks for coming tonight.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.653
I just wanna know how Tywan's
doing in summer school?

30:43.710 --> 30:47.786
- Alright, I guess, why?

30:47.786 --> 30:50.193
Well, if he maintains a 2.5,

30:51.425 --> 30:53.340
then he'll be back on track for college.

30:53.340 --> 30:54.831
A lot of colleges--

30:54.831 --> 30:56.248
- Oh, ah, ah, ah.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.783
That boy ain't going to no college, okay?

31:02.650 --> 31:05.390
So I'ma need for you to stop filling

31:05.390 --> 31:07.873
his head with all this foolishness.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.563
He lucky I let him play basketball.

31:14.690 --> 31:18.480
I only do that so his dumb
butt stay out of trouble.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.120
- Look, now wait a minute, Marie.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.880
Tywan is not dumb and he has a good chance

31:22.880 --> 31:24.610
of getting a full-ride scholarship.

31:24.610 --> 31:26.860
(laughing)

31:30.211 --> 31:33.013
- Whatever, you just stick to coaching,

31:33.920 --> 31:36.553
let me worry about Tywan's schooling.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.273
College.

31:39.463 --> 31:41.713
(laughing)

31:45.212 --> 31:47.795
(gentle music)

31:56.462 --> 31:57.350
(whistle blows)

31:57.350 --> 31:58.800
- Alright fellas, line it up.

32:01.744 --> 32:02.577
(whistle blows)

32:02.577 --> 32:04.870
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in.

32:10.937 --> 32:12.687
Alright, have a seat.

32:16.690 --> 32:18.973
Do you guys understand what chemistry is?

32:20.985 --> 32:22.280
Yes Alex.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.620
- [Alex] Isn't it like, what
Coach Randy had with Moe's Mom?

32:25.620 --> 32:26.453
- Hey, shut up!

32:27.740 --> 32:31.243
- Alex, get on the line and
give me five wind sprints.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.634
- [Alex] Are you a sad--

32:32.634 --> 32:34.092
- Now!

32:34.092 --> 32:34.925
Go!

32:38.107 --> 32:40.870
Does anybody else have
anything else smart to say?

32:40.870 --> 32:41.803
- [All] No Coach.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.000
- Now as I was saying.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.320
Chemistry is the interaction

32:50.320 --> 32:52.910
of one personality with another.

32:52.910 --> 32:54.633
It's a sympathetic understanding.

32:55.770 --> 32:58.423
Chemistry is what makes a good team great.

32:59.680 --> 33:03.240
Now, I think you guys
have a great opportunity

33:03.240 --> 33:05.240
of doing something really big this year.

33:07.020 --> 33:09.630
You guys got all the talent in the world,

33:09.630 --> 33:11.450
but if you don't come together

33:11.450 --> 33:15.563
and start playing as one unit,
your talent means nothing.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.330
I got you guys signed up to play

33:20.330 --> 33:23.990
in some of the best
tournaments in the country,

33:23.990 --> 33:26.850
with some of the best teams in the nation.

33:26.850 --> 33:28.620
And I honestly feel like you guys

33:28.620 --> 33:31.250
have what it takes to go the distance.

33:31.250 --> 33:34.140
But if you don't stop
goofing off with each other,

33:34.140 --> 33:36.402
and fighting amongst each other,

33:36.402 --> 33:37.913
you're going to lose.

33:39.536 --> 33:41.393
Fellas, look around you, look.

33:44.163 --> 33:46.493
The men you see around you,

33:47.480 --> 33:50.253
they're your team, your family.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.893
We don't just bring you
guys here just to run you.

33:56.258 --> 33:59.370
We bring you guys here because we care,

33:59.370 --> 34:02.232
and we wanna see you
do big things in life.

34:02.232 --> 34:03.690
Like go to college,

34:03.690 --> 34:05.743
do something productive with yourself.

34:07.060 --> 34:09.313
And stop fighting amongst each other.

34:11.322 --> 34:16.322
But you gotta want it and you
got be able to work for it.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.513
And stop fighting amongst each other.

34:20.650 --> 34:21.483
You understand?

34:22.452 --> 34:24.679
- [All] Yes Coach.

34:24.679 --> 34:27.400
- Now we got a tournament next weekend,

34:27.400 --> 34:30.483
and I promise you that
if you miss any practices

34:30.483 --> 34:33.870
from now until then, you won't play.

34:33.870 --> 34:34.743
It's that simple.

34:35.650 --> 34:36.483
You got me?

34:37.330 --> 34:38.556
- [All] Yes Coach.

34:38.556 --> 34:39.389
- Alright, bring it in, come on.

34:40.788 --> 34:43.139
(clapping)

34:43.139 --> 34:44.389
Warriors on three, one, two, three.

34:44.389 --> 34:45.889
- [All] Warriors!

34:45.889 --> 34:47.840
- T, you got a ride?

34:47.840 --> 34:49.290
- [Tywan] Yeah, Moe's dropping me off.

34:49.290 --> 34:50.123
- Okay.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.378
(sighs)

34:54.378 --> 34:56.090
- Well, I think everything
went pretty well.

34:56.090 --> 34:58.270
The parents all seem to be on board.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.560
What you think Coach?

34:59.560 --> 35:00.690
- Man, I though it was cool.

35:00.690 --> 35:02.210
- Yeah.

35:02.210 --> 35:03.950
- So, what's up with you and Candy?

35:03.950 --> 35:05.184
- What?

35:05.184 --> 35:07.000
What you talking about?

35:07.000 --> 35:09.073
- Candy, Moe's Mom.

35:09.950 --> 35:12.650
Come on Randy, don't
play me like that man.

35:12.650 --> 35:14.450
I saw you over there talking to her.

35:15.420 --> 35:16.914
Man, please tell me

35:16.914 --> 35:18.740
you're not messing around with that woman.

35:18.740 --> 35:21.370
- No Coach, I ain't messing with her.

35:21.370 --> 35:22.370
We was just talking.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.710
- Randy, you know I know
you better than that right?

35:26.710 --> 35:29.850
You know, dealing with
these kids is hard enough.

35:29.850 --> 35:32.633
And then dealing with their
parents make it even harder.

35:33.700 --> 35:35.640
I can't have you complicating things man,

35:35.640 --> 35:38.073
by messing around with these kids mamas.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.323
Look man, don't crap where you eat.

35:42.522 --> 35:44.940
This world way too big
for you to be trolling

35:44.940 --> 35:47.040
around these player's mama pool for women.

35:48.080 --> 35:48.913
- Okay.

35:48.913 --> 35:49.746
I hear you.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.015
- I mean it Randy.

35:52.015 --> 35:52.848
- Okay.

36:09.392 --> 36:10.533
- How's it going?

36:12.330 --> 36:13.163
- It's going.

36:14.859 --> 36:16.509
- Okay, what do you mean by that?

36:17.388 --> 36:20.450
- I don't know how we're
going to make it to nationals.

36:20.450 --> 36:23.360
- Ah, you say that every year,

36:23.360 --> 36:25.563
and every year, God provides a way.

36:26.910 --> 36:27.943
- Yeah, you right.

36:31.100 --> 36:34.050
- And since we're on the
subject of blessings,

36:34.050 --> 36:36.960
one of my co-workers is
looking for a team for her son.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.163
You remember Dana Hart?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.620
Yeah, he's 17.

36:41.620 --> 36:45.343
He's a guard, he used to
play with the Dragons.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.760
- Well, if he's so good,

36:47.760 --> 36:50.030
why isn't he still
playing with the Dragons?

36:50.030 --> 36:52.260
- Well, he kinda got into it

36:52.260 --> 36:55.230
with his Coach and got
kicked off the team.

36:55.230 --> 36:56.360
And he...

36:58.080 --> 36:58.913
- And what?

36:59.770 --> 37:00.603
(sighs)

37:00.603 --> 37:02.368
- He's had some run-ins with the law.

37:02.368 --> 37:03.360
(laughs)

37:03.360 --> 37:06.777
Dylan, don't laugh.

37:06.777 --> 37:09.570
This is a single mother
we're talking about.

37:09.570 --> 37:11.743
She's at her wits end with her son.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.470
She says he's really
not a bad kid at heart,

37:15.470 --> 37:17.320
he just has some pent up frustration

37:17.320 --> 37:19.720
and he doesn't know how to
deal with it the right way.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.270
And on top of that he hangs
around the wrong crowd.

37:23.310 --> 37:25.680
Dylan, she really believes he has

37:25.680 --> 37:27.950
the potential to do something great,

37:27.950 --> 37:30.250
if he just gets put in
the right situation.

37:30.250 --> 37:33.683
And I think that situation
could be with the Warriors.

37:35.611 --> 37:37.830
- What are you trying to do to me woman?

37:37.830 --> 37:40.430
I already got 10 and that's pushing it.

37:40.430 --> 37:42.390
- Come on Dylan.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.380
I'm not asking you to say yes right away,

37:44.380 --> 37:45.633
just think about it.

37:46.780 --> 37:50.540
Honey, look, you really
have a way with those boys

37:50.540 --> 37:53.590
and I tell you, when she
started talking to me,

37:53.590 --> 37:56.260
I knew right then, that God sent her

37:56.260 --> 37:57.963
to talk to me for a reason.

37:58.990 --> 38:01.433
Come on, think about it.

38:04.744 --> 38:09.453
- I'll think about it, but
I'm not making any promises.

38:10.730 --> 38:12.872
So don't get your hopes up.

38:12.872 --> 38:14.337
- Okay, that's all I can ask.

38:15.752 --> 38:16.853
Thank you baby.

38:18.247 --> 38:20.493
And don't forget about the
doctor's appointment tomorrow.

38:20.493 --> 38:23.446
- Yeah I know, 3 o'clock sharp.

38:23.446 --> 38:24.346
- Uh-huh.

38:24.346 --> 38:25.513
- I got it.

38:25.513 --> 38:26.346
- Attaboy.

38:29.510 --> 38:32.427
(distant shouting)

38:33.353 --> 38:36.500
(upbeat music)

38:36.500 --> 38:38.558
- Be patient, you ain't
gotta force nothing.

38:38.558 --> 38:39.391
Come on.

38:41.821 --> 38:44.239
Alright, alright Mike, good job boy.

38:44.239 --> 38:47.822
Now get back, get back,
let's go, let's go.

38:56.819 --> 38:58.069
- Move it Mike.

39:02.269 --> 39:04.852
- Come on Dewey, let's go baby.

39:06.246 --> 39:08.496
(cheering)

39:12.799 --> 39:15.462
Great job, great work, great work.

39:15.462 --> 39:17.300
Good job boys, good job.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.433
Man, way to go get it.

39:19.433 --> 39:22.382
Alright, line up, line
up, line up, line up.

39:22.382 --> 39:23.844
Come on, come on.

39:23.844 --> 39:25.707
Great job fellas.

39:25.707 --> 39:28.752
(clapping)

39:28.752 --> 39:30.720
Great job, yeah.

39:30.720 --> 39:31.887
Good job, boy.

39:33.694 --> 39:35.462
- [Randy] Work it, work it, work it.

39:35.462 --> 39:37.712
- Bring it in, bring it in.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.224
Hey fellas, great game man, great game.

39:42.224 --> 39:44.120
(clapping)

39:44.120 --> 39:48.690
Hey, what I saw out there
today was team basketball.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.700
I mean, we had a few weak moments,

39:50.700 --> 39:52.770
but you guys recovered quickly.

39:52.770 --> 39:55.890
And overall, I'm very
proud of you guys man.

39:55.890 --> 39:58.840
Hey, moved the ball
around and we executed.

39:58.840 --> 39:59.990
Great job fellas.

39:59.990 --> 40:00.823
- [Randy] Oh yes.

40:00.823 --> 40:02.077
- Hey, you know what?

40:02.923 --> 40:05.236
And to celebrate, I'm taking
you all out for some pizza.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.486
(cheering)

40:09.192 --> 40:10.990
- Let's go, let's go.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.585
Let's go.

40:12.585 --> 40:14.404
- Up top, up top baby.

40:14.404 --> 40:15.321
- Hey, hey.

40:17.530 --> 40:19.250
- Hey, good game today man.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.083
- You too man.

40:20.977 --> 40:22.060
Hey, you might be on my level yet.

40:22.060 --> 40:23.060
- Oh yeah, whatever.

40:24.026 --> 40:27.109
(distant chattering)

40:34.032 --> 40:35.040
- Hey Dad, what's up?

40:35.040 --> 40:36.254
- What was that?

40:36.254 --> 40:37.087
- What you talking about?

40:37.087 --> 40:37.920
We won.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.830
- But you only scored, like 10 points.

40:38.830 --> 40:41.320
You shoulda at least scored
20 by my calculations.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.570
It's like every time you grab the ball,

40:42.570 --> 40:43.970
you just looking to pass.

40:43.970 --> 40:46.673
- But Dad, we won, everybody played good.

40:46.673 --> 40:49.230
- I didn't come here to
see everybody play good.

40:49.230 --> 40:51.207
I came here to see my son play good.

40:51.207 --> 40:52.700
Now let's go.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.510
- But Dad, Coach is taking
everybody out to celebrate.

40:55.510 --> 40:57.850
- Celebrate that lackluster performance?

40:57.850 --> 41:00.130
No, you need to go home
and work on your game.

41:00.130 --> 41:01.033
- Come on, Dad.

41:03.030 --> 41:04.720
- Do you wanna play college ball?

41:04.720 --> 41:06.021
- You know I wanna play college--

41:06.021 --> 41:07.883
- Well, you gotta do whatever
it takes to make that happen.

41:08.932 --> 41:10.210
And that means sacrifice.

41:10.210 --> 41:12.560
- But Dad, I just wanna
celebrate with my team.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.733
- Celebrate with your team
or perfect your craft?

41:20.810 --> 41:23.383
- Hey Mike, we waiting on you, you coming?

41:26.100 --> 41:28.683
- Nah man, I got work to do.

41:37.803 --> 41:41.970
("Jesus on my Mind" by Da Church)

41:48.138 --> 41:51.221
(distant chattering)

41:53.591 --> 41:54.973
- [Scotty] Hey Coach, you gonna have

41:54.973 --> 41:56.183
to get Red a booster seat,

41:56.183 --> 41:57.269
you know he can't see over the table?

41:57.269 --> 41:58.329
(laughing)

41:58.329 --> 42:00.060
Little fella.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.270
- Ha, ha, but I was tall enough to reach

42:02.270 --> 42:04.440
the door knob to let
your mama out last night.

42:04.440 --> 42:05.273
- Hey.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.190
- Hey man, I told you man.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.220
You don't talk about my mama, yo.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.470
- Hey fellas, listen up.

42:10.470 --> 42:12.780
Y'all gotta quit with them mama jokes.

42:12.780 --> 42:13.893
It's disrespectful.

42:14.750 --> 42:17.620
Now, we're here to celebrate
a great game today.

42:17.620 --> 42:20.893
So, just be quiet and
enjoy your food, alright?

42:22.332 --> 42:23.570
Right.

42:23.570 --> 42:27.393
- Hey Coach, I'm sorry, my bad.

42:28.260 --> 42:30.013
- Yeah Coach, he's sorry.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.660
- Red.

42:33.660 --> 42:36.040
- Okay Coach, I've been
meaning to tell you.

42:36.040 --> 42:37.610
I'm happy for you and your wife,

42:37.610 --> 42:39.020
you know, about the baby and all.

42:39.020 --> 42:41.950
But I've been praying that
this baby don't come out

42:41.950 --> 42:44.670
with your head, 'cause you
got a big watermelon head.

42:44.670 --> 42:46.810
- Hey, yo dawg, this
dude disrespectful man.

42:46.810 --> 42:48.980
Yo, what's wrong with your manners?

42:48.980 --> 42:50.120
- He can't even hold
it above his shoulders,

42:50.120 --> 42:53.133
he be like this, ah, help me up.

42:53.133 --> 42:54.690
(laughing)

42:54.690 --> 42:56.120
- That's really funny.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.420
I bet you the memory of that joke

42:57.420 --> 42:58.950
will keep you company when you sitting

42:58.950 --> 43:01.387
on the bench during the next game.

43:01.387 --> 43:02.652
- [All] Ooo.

43:02.652 --> 43:04.040
- Oh, oh, no need to get personal Coach.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.190
Look at his face Coach, look
at his hair Coach, come on.

43:07.190 --> 43:08.283
- Knock it off, knock it off boy.

43:08.283 --> 43:12.533
You, you just be talking
a little too much.

43:12.533 --> 43:15.123
- Hey, seriously Coach,
what's up with Mike?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.200
- What do you mean?

43:18.200 --> 43:21.210
- I mean, his Dad won't ever
let him hang out with us.

43:21.210 --> 43:22.567
What's up with that?

43:22.567 --> 43:23.400
- Yeah.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.450
- I don't know.

43:24.450 --> 43:27.170
Something you'd have to ask Mike about.

43:27.170 --> 43:29.290
- I'm saying though, he act
like he's so much better

43:29.290 --> 43:31.063
than the rest of the team or something.

43:32.290 --> 43:33.123
- Yeah.

43:33.123 --> 43:34.555
- Look here fellas.

43:34.555 --> 43:36.470
We're here to celebrate
a great game today.

43:36.470 --> 43:38.380
Those who can make it are here.

43:38.380 --> 43:41.513
Those who couldn't, or
chose not to, are not.

43:42.687 --> 43:44.720
And if you wanna know why
Mike ain't here tonight,

43:44.720 --> 43:46.640
that's something you'd have to ask him.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.265
'Cause only he can answer
that question for you.

43:49.265 --> 43:50.098
You feel me?

43:50.098 --> 43:51.457
- Yes Coach.

43:51.457 --> 43:52.357
- [All] Yes Coach.

43:53.350 --> 43:56.750
- Hey, you guys looked really
good out there today man.

43:56.750 --> 43:59.379
Seriously, keep playing like that

43:59.379 --> 44:00.989
and we're not gonna mess about

44:00.989 --> 44:02.411
and win us a championship trophy.

44:02.411 --> 44:04.627
(cheering)

44:04.627 --> 44:07.673
(shouting over each other)

44:07.673 --> 44:08.506
What are we?

44:08.506 --> 44:09.339
- [All] Warriors!

44:09.339 --> 44:10.755
- [Dylan] What are we?
- [All] Warriors!

44:10.755 --> 44:11.730
- [Dylan] What do we do?
- [All] Work hard, get better!

44:11.730 --> 44:13.716
- [Dylan] What do we do?
- [All] Work hard, get better!

44:13.716 --> 44:15.966
(cheering)

44:30.440 --> 44:32.480
- Alright Coach, thanks
for the pizza and the ride.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.480
- No problem, T.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.313
- Alright

44:35.540 --> 44:37.093
- T, wait up.

44:38.712 --> 44:40.962
(rustling)

44:49.486 --> 44:51.070
- What's this for?

44:51.070 --> 44:51.903
- Swimming.

44:53.214 --> 44:54.887
Man, what do you think they're for?

44:56.520 --> 44:57.530
Go ahead and open them.

44:57.530 --> 44:59.030
See if they're the right size.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.583
Well, are they the right size?

45:11.293 --> 45:13.340
- I can't take these.

45:13.340 --> 45:14.173
- Why not?

45:15.386 --> 45:17.490
You need new shoes.

45:17.490 --> 45:20.047
You been working hard
out there on the court.

45:20.047 --> 45:21.974
And I also had a long
talk with your teacher

45:21.974 --> 45:24.624
and she tell me you've really
been applying yourself.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.623
Hey, you deserve it, man, go ahead.

45:29.387 --> 45:31.330
- I can't.

45:31.330 --> 45:34.243
- T, you need new shoes man.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.250
I can't have you out there playing

45:36.250 --> 45:37.730
in shoes that are falling apart

45:37.730 --> 45:39.893
and not giving you the proper support.

45:42.158 --> 45:43.825
Look man, it's okay.

45:45.330 --> 45:47.460
We all need help sometimes.

45:47.460 --> 45:48.293
It's cool man.

45:49.780 --> 45:51.493
Take 'em man, they're yours.

45:55.210 --> 45:56.113
- Thanks Coach.

45:58.130 --> 46:01.437
- Hey, I told you man, I'm here for you.

46:03.517 --> 46:05.673
All I wanna see you is succeed in life.

46:07.067 --> 46:07.984
That's all.

46:09.170 --> 46:10.003
- Thanks Coach.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.217
- See you tomorrow man.

46:13.217 --> 46:15.300
- See you tomorrow Coach.

46:17.126 --> 46:17.959
Thank you.

46:23.119 --> 46:25.702
(gentle music)

46:35.770 --> 46:39.068
- 34 points that man
scored in that last game.

46:39.068 --> 46:39.901
- Oh.

46:39.901 --> 46:42.313
- That's exceptional, exceptional.

46:42.313 --> 46:44.234
He should be doing big things.

46:44.234 --> 46:46.064
- Yes, he should do.

46:46.064 --> 46:47.392
(mumbles)

46:47.392 --> 46:49.809
Well if that's what it takes.

46:51.604 --> 46:53.053
- Well, well, well.

46:54.260 --> 46:56.201
If it ain't the man of the hour.

46:56.201 --> 46:57.120
(laughing)

46:57.120 --> 46:58.667
We were just talking about you.

46:58.667 --> 46:59.540
- Sure was.

46:59.540 --> 47:00.663
Hey baby.

47:01.560 --> 47:04.500
Listen, Mr. Stoney here
was just telling me

47:04.500 --> 47:05.970
how much of a great player you are.

47:05.970 --> 47:07.410
- That's right.

47:07.410 --> 47:09.340
But, I told him he wasn't telling me

47:09.340 --> 47:11.143
nothing I didn't already know.

47:12.170 --> 47:13.873
Come on baby, sit on down.

47:14.787 --> 47:15.926
- Nah, I'm good.

47:15.926 --> 47:18.147
I'm actually really tired,
I'm gonna go lay down.

47:18.147 --> 47:20.483
- Ah, boy, get over here.

47:21.970 --> 47:25.460
This nice man came all the
way over here to talk to you.

47:25.460 --> 47:28.083
The least you can do is
hear what he has to say.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.810
Hmm, go ahead Mr. Stoney.

47:32.810 --> 47:35.020
- Look son, I know it's been a long day,

47:35.020 --> 47:37.960
I understand, so I'ma cut
straight to the chase.

47:37.960 --> 47:39.736
I've been watching you play

47:39.736 --> 47:41.932
for a minute now and I
like how you get down.

47:41.932 --> 47:42.967
You know I run the Infinity Squad

47:42.967 --> 47:44.773
and I want you to come play for me.

47:46.610 --> 47:48.110
Look, I know you play for the Warriors,

47:48.110 --> 47:49.910
I know you like playing for the Warriors,

47:49.910 --> 47:52.170
but at this point in
your high school career,

47:52.170 --> 47:54.861
it's time for you to start
thinking about your future.

47:54.861 --> 47:58.721
You know, college, NBA.

47:58.721 --> 48:01.052
- Like you said, I'm happy where I'm at.

48:01.052 --> 48:02.899
(laughing)

48:02.899 --> 48:04.730
- Son, the Warriors are good.

48:04.730 --> 48:06.580
They good, they alright, yeah.

48:06.580 --> 48:10.940
But the Infinity Squad
is the best, the elite.

48:10.940 --> 48:13.693
We got sponsors to pay
for all our equipment,

48:15.359 --> 48:19.260
uniforms, shoes, even travel.

48:19.260 --> 48:21.410
And all you have to do
is show up and play.

48:22.440 --> 48:25.233
- Whey, I like the sound of that.

48:25.233 --> 48:28.060
Huh, because I'm tired of them calling me

48:28.060 --> 48:29.933
to do all them fundraisers.

48:31.727 --> 48:35.870
Now you did say pay for everything?

48:35.870 --> 48:37.343
- Oh yeah, everything.

48:37.343 --> 48:40.243
And all you have to do
is show up and play.

48:41.410 --> 48:43.413
Give it some thought Tywan.

48:43.413 --> 48:45.276
Come to one of our, matter of fact

48:45.276 --> 48:47.090
you can come to our next practice.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.760
- Look, I'm sorry Mr. Stoney,

48:48.760 --> 48:52.850
but I'm not interested in
playing for you or anyone else.

48:52.850 --> 48:54.533
But thanks for stopping by.

48:55.440 --> 48:56.273
- Alright.

48:58.549 --> 49:00.549
(sighs)

49:03.437 --> 49:04.354
- What the.

49:06.827 --> 49:09.643
Excuse him, I will talk to him.

49:09.643 --> 49:11.930
- It's okay, I'm sure he'll come around.

49:11.930 --> 49:13.490
All my information is on there.

49:13.490 --> 49:16.509
Give it to him, whenever he
ready, we'll be ready for him.

49:16.509 --> 49:18.871
- Oh, okay, well thanks for stopping by.

49:18.871 --> 49:21.271
- Thank you, thank you
for your time, take care.

49:22.164 --> 49:23.020
- [Marie] You have a good day.

49:23.020 --> 49:23.970
- [Stoney] You too.

49:29.420 --> 49:30.253
Alright.

49:48.492 --> 49:49.990
- What is your problem?

49:49.990 --> 49:52.397
- Nothing, I'm fine where I'm at.

49:53.483 --> 49:55.703
- I don't think you
know who you talking to.

49:56.670 --> 49:59.860
But I make all the decisions around here.

49:59.860 --> 50:02.100
- Mama, I don't wanna play for them.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.570
I don't even know them.

50:03.570 --> 50:06.370
The Warriors is my team and
that's where I wanna be.

50:06.370 --> 50:07.700
- This ain't about loyalty.

50:07.700 --> 50:09.023
Wake up Tywan!

50:10.410 --> 50:12.393
This about doing what you gotta do.

50:14.350 --> 50:17.180
This about going as far as you can go,

50:17.180 --> 50:19.130
and getting what you can get out of it.

50:20.690 --> 50:23.910
Now they talking about
paying for everything.

50:23.910 --> 50:25.960
What are the Warriors doing for you, huh?

50:27.241 --> 50:28.400
- The Warriors got me where I'm at.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.547
Coach Dylan's the one who
helped me work on my game,

50:30.547 --> 50:32.610
and I encouraged me to
do better at school,

50:32.610 --> 50:34.380
so I can go to college.

50:34.380 --> 50:35.213
- College?

50:36.494 --> 50:38.694
Boy you better get your
head out the clouds!

50:39.660 --> 50:41.283
The only way you're going to college

50:41.283 --> 50:45.000
is with a basketball tied
around your stupid neck.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.057
You ain't book smart, Tywan.

50:48.020 --> 50:50.210
And if this man can pay for everything

50:50.210 --> 50:51.930
in order for you to play basketball

50:51.930 --> 50:54.870
and possibly get people looking at you,

50:54.870 --> 50:57.723
then that's what needs
to happen, end of story.

50:59.590 --> 51:03.650
Besides, he said he was gonna pay extra

51:03.650 --> 51:06.453
on the rent next month, okay?

51:07.585 --> 51:11.590
And he has the hook up
in making sure you pass

51:11.590 --> 51:15.943
that ACT test to qualify you for college.

51:16.870 --> 51:19.920
Now, I don't see the Warriors

51:19.920 --> 51:22.033
doing any of that around here, do you?

51:26.800 --> 51:29.323
Yeah, I didn't think so.

51:31.400 --> 51:35.653
Now, you're going to that practice.

51:36.730 --> 51:40.213
And if they'll have you, you
gonna play for that team.

51:41.698 --> 51:44.748
And I don't wanna hear
nothing else about it.

51:44.748 --> 51:46.630
You understand?

51:46.630 --> 51:47.630
- Yeah Mama.

51:49.715 --> 51:51.715
(sighs)

51:59.497 --> 52:01.664
(beeping)

52:04.916 --> 52:07.499
(gentle music)

52:11.260 --> 52:12.093
- Lora?

52:13.680 --> 52:14.513
Where are you?

52:19.792 --> 52:20.625
Lora?

52:21.690 --> 52:22.990
Hey, honey, where are you?

52:27.334 --> 52:29.030
What's wrong baby?

52:29.030 --> 52:30.637
- Oh, Dylan.

52:30.637 --> 52:31.838
- What's wrong.

52:31.838 --> 52:33.418
- It hurts so bad, please.

52:33.418 --> 52:34.762
Just call the doctor.

52:34.762 --> 52:35.845
- Okay, okay.

52:37.562 --> 52:40.703
(breathing heavily)

52:40.703 --> 52:41.786
Breathe baby.

52:43.184 --> 52:44.017
Ah, shoot.

52:45.371 --> 52:47.345
Look, we need to get you to the car.

52:47.345 --> 52:48.809
Do you want me to carry you?

52:48.809 --> 52:49.711
Walk?

52:49.711 --> 52:50.888
- No, no, I can walk.

52:50.888 --> 52:53.597
- Okay, come on, take
your time, take your time.

52:53.597 --> 52:54.847
- Oh, it hurts.

52:56.381 --> 52:58.453
- Come on baby, it's gonna be okay.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.950
- Mr. Baxter?

53:06.950 --> 53:09.150
- Hey doc, how's she doing?

53:09.150 --> 53:10.160
Is the baby okay?

53:10.160 --> 53:12.580
- Yes Mr. Baxter, your wife is doing fine,

53:12.580 --> 53:16.687
and your baby is doing
fine as well, for now.

53:16.687 --> 53:18.690
- What do you mean for now?

53:18.690 --> 53:19.790
- She's suffering from a condition

53:19.790 --> 53:23.190
called placental abruption,
which means that the placenta

53:23.190 --> 53:25.610
is separating from the uterine lining.

53:25.610 --> 53:28.220
It's caused by abnormalities
inside here uterus.

53:28.220 --> 53:30.517
Now, right now, there is
only a partial separation,

53:30.517 --> 53:32.470
but if it gets any worse, it will result

53:32.470 --> 53:35.010
in us having to take the baby early.

53:35.010 --> 53:36.320
Which wouldn't be good because she's only

53:36.320 --> 53:39.913
in her 29th week, and that
would not be good for the baby.

53:41.061 --> 53:42.400
- Well, what does that mean?

53:42.400 --> 53:44.411
What can we do about it?

53:44.411 --> 53:46.830
- For the time being, I'm
placing her on strict bed rest.

53:46.830 --> 53:48.860
She should stay off her
feet as much as possible

53:48.860 --> 53:51.270
so that we can try to minimize the chances

53:51.270 --> 53:52.993
of any further separation.

53:53.870 --> 53:56.420
- Okay, well, I mean, can I go see her?

53:56.420 --> 53:57.253
- Of course.

54:00.658 --> 54:03.491
(monitor beeping)

54:09.785 --> 54:11.285
- How you feeling?

54:12.533 --> 54:15.670
- Like a couple of horses
kicked me in the stomach

54:15.670 --> 54:18.500
and then trampled it a few times.

54:18.500 --> 54:19.463
- That bad, huh?

54:21.060 --> 54:21.893
- Yeah.

54:24.070 --> 54:27.697
So I guess this means no more
fun for me for a while, huh?

54:27.697 --> 54:29.405
(gentle music)

54:29.405 --> 54:31.160
- Well, look at the bright side.

54:31.160 --> 54:33.410
You get to be waited on hand and foot now,

54:33.410 --> 54:34.310
until you deliver.

54:35.180 --> 54:37.443
- Yippee, cue the band.

54:41.232 --> 54:43.565
- Look, I talked to your mom

54:44.770 --> 54:46.810
and she said she will be here in a day.

54:46.810 --> 54:48.710
She'll stay as long as we need her to.

54:51.560 --> 54:53.113
- I'm so scared Dylan.

54:55.030 --> 54:55.863
- Me too.

54:57.257 --> 54:59.760
But no matter what, we gotta trust

54:59.760 --> 55:01.170
that God will see us through this.

55:01.170 --> 55:04.433
- But what if God sees
fit to take our child?

55:05.550 --> 55:07.330
I don't know if I can handle that.

55:07.330 --> 55:09.880
- Baby, don't think like that.

55:11.427 --> 55:16.123
All we can do is pray and
take each day as it comes.

55:17.391 --> 55:18.224
Okay?

55:19.379 --> 55:20.476
(sighs)

55:20.476 --> 55:21.309
- Okay.

55:35.010 --> 55:37.177
(mumbles)

55:40.256 --> 55:42.256
- Come on, hey, stretch.

55:43.104 --> 55:44.187
Slow it down.

55:50.380 --> 55:51.670
Oh well, well.

55:51.670 --> 55:53.470
Now ain't you a sight for sore eyes.

55:54.389 --> 55:55.360
I'm glad to see you made the choice

55:55.360 --> 55:56.910
to come to the winner's circle.

55:58.770 --> 56:00.330
- Thank you, Mr. Stoney.

56:00.330 --> 56:02.380
We appreciate the opportunity.

56:02.380 --> 56:05.880
- No, no, no, it's us who appreciates you.

56:05.880 --> 56:07.480
Look son, we got your gear

56:07.480 --> 56:10.200
and your uniform over
here all set up for you.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.624
Ms. Thomas--

56:11.624 --> 56:13.555
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

56:13.555 --> 56:15.428
Call me Marie.

56:15.428 --> 56:16.573
- Okay, Marie.

56:16.573 --> 56:18.190
Well Marie, if you go over
here and see my man John,

56:18.190 --> 56:19.860
he got all the necessary paperwork

56:19.860 --> 56:21.570
and forms we need for you to sign.

56:21.570 --> 56:23.120
So we can get the ball rolling.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.490
T-Money.

56:24.490 --> 56:25.572
- My name's Tywan.

56:25.572 --> 56:26.640
- My bad.

56:26.640 --> 56:30.000
T-Money, if you wanna jump
in the drills and warm-ups,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.483
we figure how we can
get you into rotation.

56:35.179 --> 56:37.510
- He's just nervous.

56:37.510 --> 56:39.470
He don't take well to change.

56:39.470 --> 56:41.740
Go, now.

56:41.740 --> 56:43.800
Go now Tywan, go.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.560
- Ms. Thomas, Marie?

56:45.560 --> 56:46.393
- Mm-hmm?

56:47.286 --> 56:48.570
- If...

56:48.570 --> 56:50.460
Maybe we can get up a little bit,

56:50.460 --> 56:52.670
if Mama wasn't over here angry with him.

56:52.670 --> 56:54.420
So have you got some errands to run,

56:54.420 --> 56:56.460
or something you might have to do,

56:56.460 --> 56:57.910
I could drop him off after practice.

56:57.910 --> 56:59.133
- Oh, is that right?

57:00.179 --> 57:01.877
And you don't mind?

57:01.877 --> 57:03.763
- Not at all, not at all.

57:06.890 --> 57:09.433
- Well, if you're sure.

57:10.820 --> 57:13.593
Then I guess I'll see you
later on this evening.

57:14.690 --> 57:17.153
- No worries, everything
gonna be fine, trust me.

57:18.440 --> 57:19.273
- Alright now.

57:21.773 --> 57:23.940
(mumbles)

57:32.199 --> 57:33.207
- Oh man, you dirty--

57:34.061 --> 57:35.300
- [Randy] Hey fellas.

57:35.300 --> 57:36.657
Hustle up, come on, bring it in.

57:41.510 --> 57:44.056
Well, looks like Coach Dylan's

57:44.056 --> 57:46.136
gonna be off for a little bit.

57:46.136 --> 57:47.619
So y'all stuck with me.

57:47.619 --> 57:48.460
- Great.

57:48.460 --> 57:49.293
- What was that?

57:50.390 --> 57:51.340
Is there a problem?

57:52.330 --> 57:53.920
- Nah man.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.430
- So where's Coach?

57:55.430 --> 57:57.600
- Well Coach got some personal
business to take care of,

57:57.600 --> 57:59.810
and if he wanna tell us
about it when he gets back,

57:59.810 --> 58:00.970
then that's what he'll do.

58:00.970 --> 58:03.593
But until then, it's business as usual.

58:05.790 --> 58:06.763
Hey, where's T?

58:07.770 --> 58:08.640
- I don't know.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.010
I called him to see if he needed a ride

58:10.010 --> 58:11.570
and he didn't answer.

58:11.570 --> 58:12.580
He never called me back.

58:12.580 --> 58:13.990
- Alright, well y'all already know,

58:13.990 --> 58:15.573
one monkey don't stop no show.

58:16.506 --> 58:17.740
But we got a game this weekend,

58:17.740 --> 58:20.610
and we can't have no L's
for Coach to come back to.

58:20.610 --> 58:21.715
- Now that's right.

58:21.715 --> 58:22.600
- Alright, so let's get it.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.500
Warriors on three.

58:24.400 --> 58:25.270
One, two, three.

58:25.270 --> 58:26.580
- [All] Warriors.

58:26.580 --> 58:28.358
- [Randy] Let's go.

58:28.358 --> 58:30.607
(whistle blows)

58:30.607 --> 58:31.945
(clapping)

58:31.945 --> 58:32.778
Come on.

58:32.778 --> 58:34.844
- Our little baby boy alright?

58:34.844 --> 58:35.677
- Uh-huh.

58:35.677 --> 58:37.451
He's gonna be doing jumping Jacks.

58:37.451 --> 58:38.284
He's doing good.

58:38.284 --> 58:40.269
- How's my baby feeling?

58:40.269 --> 58:41.537
- Oh, I'm fine Ma.

58:41.537 --> 58:42.897
- Good, good.

58:42.897 --> 58:45.190
Oh, Dylan, run in the kitchen
and grab here drink for me,

58:45.190 --> 58:46.250
it's on the counter.

58:46.250 --> 58:48.455
- Yes, Ma'am, I'll be right back.

58:48.455 --> 58:49.790
- Alright.

58:49.790 --> 58:51.230
There you go.

58:51.230 --> 58:54.740
I made you some good old,
homemade chicken noodle soup.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.928
And your favorite biscuits and honey.

58:56.928 --> 58:58.920
That ought to get Grandma's baby

58:59.781 --> 59:01.707
acting right in there, right?

59:03.342 --> 59:04.842
- Hmm, mm, mm, mm.

59:11.171 --> 59:12.004
Not bad.

59:18.813 --> 59:21.646
(phone vibrating)

59:26.226 --> 59:27.476
- Hey, what's going on D?

59:28.720 --> 59:29.890
How's it going?

59:29.890 --> 59:32.693
- Much better man, Wifey's doing better.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.520
Mother's here now,

59:35.520 --> 59:38.313
so she's practically taken over the house.

59:39.946 --> 59:42.045
- [Diane] I heard that.

59:42.045 --> 59:44.930
- Man, she got ears like a bat.

59:45.890 --> 59:47.263
- Man, tell me about it.

59:48.879 --> 59:50.040
So how did the practice go today?

59:50.040 --> 59:51.340
- Well everything is cool.

59:52.380 --> 59:54.290
Except for T didn't show up.

59:54.290 --> 59:57.098
The other guys said they
haven't heard from him either.

59:57.098 --> 59:57.931
- Mm...

59:59.830 --> 01:00:00.830
That's not like him.

01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:04.511
But okay, I'll give him a call.

01:00:04.511 --> 01:00:06.880
- But yeah, other than than,
we're ready for the weekend.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.600
- Yeah, I'm gonna do my best to make it.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.170
But I'll have to keep you posted on that.

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.080
But hey, in the meantime,

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.500
I might have us another new player.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.333
- A project player?

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.270
- That's what I'm told.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:21.780
- What position does he play?

01:00:22.882 --> 01:00:24.390
(laughs)

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:25.253
- Another guard.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.110
- Yippee, look, whatever you decide.

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:32.150
You know I'm down.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.100
You know how we do it man.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.130
Rack 'em up, raise 'em right.

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.963
- That's right.

01:00:39.001 --> 01:00:41.910
Alright bro, well, I'm gonna
give Tywan a call real quick,

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:44.713
so I'll let you know how that goes, okay?

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.570
- Alright, bye.

01:00:59.387 --> 01:01:02.220
(phone vibrating)

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.800
(sighs)

01:01:18.276 --> 01:01:21.276
(phone alert rings)

01:01:27.022 --> 01:01:29.022
(sighs)

01:01:34.064 --> 01:01:34.897
- Ah, man.

01:01:41.584 --> 01:01:43.834
(clapping)

01:01:46.728 --> 01:01:49.085
- Oh man, yo what's up Coach?

01:01:49.085 --> 01:01:51.202
- Yo man, what's up, how's it going?

01:01:51.202 --> 01:01:52.322
- It's good to see you man.

01:01:52.322 --> 01:01:53.289
- It's good to see you bro.

01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:54.122
- Hey, how's Wifey?

01:01:54.122 --> 01:01:54.955
- I think she's doing a lot better.

01:01:54.955 --> 01:01:56.216
- Yeah.

01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:57.247
- Mom's been a big help for us man.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:58.320
- That's good.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.620
- They practically kicked me out.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.600
- Oh, no way.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.912
- Diane, tell me I'm all in her way.

01:02:02.912 --> 01:02:03.815
(laughing)

01:02:03.815 --> 01:02:04.648
So there you go.

01:02:04.648 --> 01:02:05.481
But hey, I'm here.

01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:06.921
- You are.

01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:07.754
- So what's going on?

01:02:07.754 --> 01:02:10.229
- Well, you know, since T's
gone, it puts Eric in his spot.

01:02:10.229 --> 01:02:12.280
I been chasing after Mike's tail.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.193
He be after showboating again.

01:02:14.193 --> 01:02:16.000
- Dad been in his ear?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:16.833
- It looks that way.

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:18.160
He was doing good at first.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.021
But then all of sudden
Mr. Run-and-gun show up.

01:02:21.021 --> 01:02:22.980
- Hey, don't worry about it, we'll see.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.095
- Hey, any word from Tywan?

01:02:25.095 --> 01:02:28.138
- No man, I'm not
worried about him either.

01:02:28.138 --> 01:02:29.050
- Okay.

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:30.850
- [Player] Hey Coach, how you doing?

01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:34.500
(buzzing)

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.920
- Alright fellas, listen up.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.820
We're gonna start the game

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:40.300
with Red, Mike, Alex,
Dewey and Eric, okay?

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.733
- Yo Coach, what happened to T?

01:02:41.733 --> 01:02:44.538
- I don't know and now's not
the time to worry about it.

01:02:44.538 --> 01:02:47.444
Hey listen up, this team is undefeated.

01:02:47.444 --> 01:02:49.400
So we're gonna start right out the gate

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.910
and play full-court, man to man.

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:53.530
Now, it's really important
that we work the ball around

01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:55.247
and take good shots, okay?

01:02:55.247 --> 01:02:56.080
- [Player] Yes Coach.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.489
- Alright?

01:02:57.489 --> 01:02:58.322
- [Player] Let's go.

01:02:58.322 --> 01:02:59.460
- Now look, this team is very disciplined.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:02.120
So we gotta go out there,
we gotta play smart,

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.271
and create some opportunities, okay?

01:03:04.271 --> 01:03:06.728
Alright, let's bring
it in, come on fellas.

01:03:06.728 --> 01:03:08.790
(clapping)

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:10.167
Warriors on three, one, two, three.

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:12.250
- [All] Warriors!

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:14.500
(clapping)

01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:23.718
(cheering)

01:03:28.856 --> 01:03:31.439
(upbeat music)

01:03:44.953 --> 01:03:47.870
(distant shouting)

01:04:12.668 --> 01:04:15.062
- Alright Mike, Mike, nice one.

01:04:15.062 --> 01:04:15.895
Now get back, get back,
come on baby, come on.

01:04:33.645 --> 01:04:36.196
Mike, what are you doing man?

01:04:36.196 --> 01:04:38.930
Use your team, Alex was wide open.

01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:52.847
What's wrong with you?

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:53.680
Come on man.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.513
- See Coach, that's
what I'm talking about.

01:04:54.513 --> 01:04:55.460
Man, he already fooling.

01:04:57.274 --> 01:05:00.081
- Mike, where you going, where you going?

01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:02.046
Time out, time out, time out.

01:05:02.046 --> 01:05:03.796
Get in here, come on.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:18.601
What did I say at the
beginning of the game?

01:05:18.601 --> 01:05:19.434
(mumbling)

01:05:19.434 --> 01:05:22.380
I said run the play and
work the ball around.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.830
I didn't say play tiddlywinks
with the basketball,

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:26.750
and get caught up with three defenders.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:27.600
Mike, you're out.

01:05:28.519 --> 01:05:30.500
- But Coach, I just made
both my free throws.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.810
- That's not the point.

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.650
You're not following directions.

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:35.250
If you can't follow directions,

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.103
I put someone in to get the job done.

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:38.953
Scotty, check in.

01:05:43.656 --> 01:05:45.823
(banging)

01:05:48.775 --> 01:05:49.608
Listen up.

01:05:51.722 --> 01:05:53.803
- That was a good game, yo.

01:05:53.803 --> 01:05:54.900
(laughs)

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.930
He's up in his thing, like this.

01:05:58.986 --> 01:06:02.069
(distant chattering)

01:06:02.963 --> 01:06:07.635
- Why would you even come
to a game looking like that.

01:06:07.635 --> 01:06:10.720
- Yo, give me something
to eat, go get that pizza.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.923
- Hey, get your butt home boy.

01:06:13.276 --> 01:06:15.533
(distant chattering)

01:06:15.533 --> 01:06:17.171
- I came through on the clutch though,

01:06:17.171 --> 01:06:18.979
that's how I do.

01:06:18.979 --> 01:06:20.236
That's it, you know it.

01:06:20.236 --> 01:06:22.319
(laughs)

01:06:24.784 --> 01:06:28.210
- Well I'll be a monkey's uncle.

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:29.910
- [Randy] Well, ain't this some bull.

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:33.570
- Hey Coach, I see you got
yourself another victory

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:36.196
out there, keep up the good work.

01:06:36.196 --> 01:06:38.250
- Come on Coach, let me get him Coach.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:39.980
- Red, it ain't worth it, let's go.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.329
- He ain't talking like that Coach.

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:42.760
- Let's go, let's go.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.627
Go, it ain't worth it.

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:48.183
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:06:49.046 --> 01:06:50.010
Come on.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.920
T, T, what's going on
man, why you with them?

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.225
- Not now, Moe.

01:06:54.225 --> 01:06:56.341
- What do you mean, not now?

01:06:56.341 --> 01:06:57.273
You walk in here with another squad

01:06:57.273 --> 01:06:58.456
and don't say nothing to nobody

01:06:58.456 --> 01:06:59.370
and you wanna tell me, not now?

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:02.040
- Like I said, not now, Moe.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.640
- [Player] Like he said, not now, Moe.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.497
- Oh really?

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.070
- Hey son, good game alright.

01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:25.903
Don't sweat it.

01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:28.010
That Coach has no idea what he's doing

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.933
and I'm tired of him holding you back.

01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:34.390
But it's good to see you
unafraid to go hard out there.

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.280
See, he doesn't understand that

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.550
a high-profile player
like yourself has to do

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:40.200
what he has to do to get noticed.

01:07:41.408 --> 01:07:43.600
But don't worry about it.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.100
I've taken care of everything.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:46.893
Let's go.

01:07:54.982 --> 01:07:57.565
(gentle music)

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:13.320
- What's wrong with you now?

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.160
- Told you I didn't
wanna play for that team.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.629
- Well what happened?

01:08:17.629 --> 01:08:19.296
What happened Tywan?

01:08:21.585 --> 01:08:22.417
Pfft.

01:08:28.026 --> 01:08:30.026
(sighs)

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.993
(phone vibrating)

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.029
- Hello?

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:44.420
- You ready to talk now?

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.899
- Talk about what?

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:48.800
I decided to play for a
different team, end of story.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.979
- T, who you trying to fool?

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:52.310
You know I know you better than that.

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.840
We go way too far back
for you to try to play me.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.712
- Yeah, whatever.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.770
- Oh, so you mean to
tell me you just woke up,

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:00.819
decided to go play for the Infinity Squad

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:03.723
without letting Coach,
the team, or me know?

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:07.761
After all Coach has done for you man.

01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:08.760
Are you just gonna leave him hanging

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.300
like that without a word?

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.830
- It's not even like that.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:13.450
I found a better situation for me,

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.093
and I don't want no drama, that's all.

01:09:16.932 --> 01:09:18.870
- No drama?

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.319
Is that what you call walking
into a game-day situation,

01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:23.770
when you never officially
quit your old team.

01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:25.120
That's not dramatic to you?

01:09:26.024 --> 01:09:28.078
I don't know what kind
of BS that Stoney dude

01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:30.046
been feeding you, but you
need to check yourself.

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:31.050
- It's not like that.

01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:32.120
Moe, on a real bro, you need to think

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.180
about come rolling with us.

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.171
I mean we got sponsors
so everything's paid for.

01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:41.210
And they got college coaches
looking at all their players.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.810
It would be a good look for you.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.880
Hey, I could talk to Stoney for you?

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.760
- I ain't trying to hear that, T!

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.520
If you wanna turn your back on your boys

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.380
and the people who've been
in your corner pulling

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.560
for you since day one, then do you,

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.110
but I don't get down like that.

01:09:58.547 --> 01:10:00.186
And never in a million
years would I have thought

01:10:00.186 --> 01:10:02.410
you did either if hadn't
seen it with my own eyes.

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.778
It would have been different
if you stepped to Coach

01:10:04.778 --> 01:10:06.786
like a man and told him what was going on,

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:08.240
but you didn't, you went
behind everybody's back

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.220
sneaking around like a little punk.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.433
- Man, I ain't no punk.

01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:14.640
- Yeah, whatever dude,
enjoy your new team.

01:10:19.195 --> 01:10:21.195
(sighs)

01:10:34.756 --> 01:10:35.920
(knocking)

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.900
- Come in.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.950
- Hello, Coach Dylan?

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:40.503
- Yes.

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.470
Justin, right?

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:44.303
- Yes sir.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:47.873
- Sir, huh?

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:50.970
Hmm.

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:53.313
Okay, come on in and sit down.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:05.490
So your mom tells me you're looking

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:07.390
for a new team to play with this year.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.020
What's that all about?

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:16.143
- I mean, with my last
coach, we kinda got into it.

01:11:17.835 --> 01:11:19.863
- Kinda got into it.

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:22.683
Like how?

01:11:25.293 --> 01:11:26.829
(sighs)

01:11:26.829 --> 01:11:29.780
- Well, he started going
in on me at practice

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:32.330
and then he put his hands
on me and I just lost it.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.090
- So, put his hands on
you like how, to hurt you?

01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:43.340
- No, like he grabbed my shoulder,

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.940
because he was yelling at
me and I was walking away.

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:48.323
- I see.

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:54.010
So your mom also tells me that you been

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.210
in trouble with the law.

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:58.460
(sighs)

01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.293
Well?

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.513
- I mean, I got arrested once
for trying to sell some weed.

01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:09.030
Our electricity got shut
off and I tried to get a job

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:12.400
to help my mom out, but
nobody would hire me.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.250
So I tried to get the money that way.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.323
- I see.

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:23.830
You got anger issues?

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:24.803
- Sometimes.

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:28.560
- You still selling drugs?

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.393
- No sir.

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:37.710
- So, what makes you think

01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.510
I should let you play for this team?

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:47.160
- I'm a good ball player,
I'm willing to work hard

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.760
and just become a better person.

01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:53.600
I'm not saying that you should
let me play for your team.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.463
I know I made some bad decisions,

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:58.193
but all I'm asking for is a chance.

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.759
(sighs)

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.063
- Okay.

01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:19.573
I'm going to give you one
shot, on a trial basis.

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:26.260
You mess up, you backtalk,
you put your hands on anybody,

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.480
or you even get caught out there

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.363
doing anything against the
law again, you're done.

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:34.330
Is that understood?

01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:35.243
- Yes Coach.

01:13:37.782 --> 01:13:40.610
- Alright well, we start
practice in 30 minutes,

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:44.030
so go in the locker room and get dressed,

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:47.180
and I'll meet you out on the court,

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.980
and introduce you to the team,
then we'll go from there.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.763
- Ah man, thank you Coach.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.333
Thank you.

01:14:00.789 --> 01:14:02.453
(sighs)

01:14:02.453 --> 01:14:03.630
- [Randy] Come on let's go.

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:04.463
There we go.

01:14:05.578 --> 01:14:06.997
(clapping)

01:14:06.997 --> 01:14:08.621
Yeah.

01:14:08.621 --> 01:14:09.454
Good job.

01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:13.887
Yo, come on, round it up.

01:14:15.283 --> 01:14:16.116
Hustle.

01:14:21.033 --> 01:14:22.553
- What's up fellas?

01:14:22.553 --> 01:14:24.185
- [All] What's up Coach?

01:14:24.185 --> 01:14:25.312
- How you all doing today?

01:14:25.312 --> 01:14:27.480
- [All] Yeah, good.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.988
- Where's Moe at?

01:14:29.988 --> 01:14:31.707
- [All] Haven't seen him.

01:14:31.707 --> 01:14:33.090
- You seen Moe?

01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:34.993
- No Coach, I ain't seen him either.

01:14:36.919 --> 01:14:39.920
Well okay, I wanna introduce
you guys to Justin.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.248
He's a guard and he's
gonna be playing with us.

01:14:42.248 --> 01:14:43.134
- [Randy] Okay.

01:14:43.134 --> 01:14:44.847
- [Dylan] Hey, introduce yourself to him

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:45.853
and make him feel welcome fellas.

01:14:47.712 --> 01:14:48.949
- Why'd you do it?

01:14:48.949 --> 01:14:50.519
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.253
- Hey, chill man, what's wrong with you?

01:14:52.253 --> 01:14:53.404
- Why'd you do it?

01:14:53.404 --> 01:14:54.237
- Okay, chill, chill.

01:14:54.237 --> 01:14:56.452
- Moe, man you don't understand.

01:14:56.452 --> 01:14:57.883
- You don't understand what?

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:01.130
- Yeah, why don't you
tell him Coach Randy?

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:02.280
Why don't you tell everybody

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.710
how you got my mama pregnant, you dirty--

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.028
- Hey, get him outta here,

01:15:06.028 --> 01:15:07.079
get him outta here fellas.

01:15:07.079 --> 01:15:07.963
Get him outta here, get him chilled out.

01:15:08.901 --> 01:15:12.080
- [Alex] Come on, come on,
chill, chill, chill, come on.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.680
- Look Coach, I didn't mean
for it to happen like this.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.780
- Man, get out.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.670
- Come on Coach, here me out.

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:20.200
- Now's not the time or the place.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.043
Get out now.

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:27.563
(somber music)

01:15:45.162 --> 01:15:46.640
Alright fellas, shows over, let's work.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.593
Come on, let's go.

01:15:48.597 --> 01:15:51.264
(whistle blows)

01:15:52.886 --> 01:15:55.469
(gentle music)

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.303
- Hey Mike, did you forget something?

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:14.000
- Nah Coach, I just wanted
to talk to you for a minute.

01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:16.540
- Yeah, sure, come on over.

01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:27.663
Is everything okay?

01:16:28.846 --> 01:16:29.703
What's on your mind?

01:16:33.738 --> 01:16:37.260
- Erm, I wanna let you
know that today will be

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.360
my last day of practice with the Warriors.

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.093
My Dad's moved me to another team.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.923
- Okay, I see.

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:49.687
Is that what you want?

01:16:53.039 --> 01:16:54.039
Well, is it?

01:16:55.933 --> 01:16:57.343
- I mean, I wanna shine.

01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:01.030
I just wanna go to school and play ball.

01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:03.580
And it's my last year at AAU.

01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:07.723
I need to do whatever I
gotta do to get D1 attention.

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.950
My Dad...

01:17:12.011 --> 01:17:14.803
No, I don't think I can do that here.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.353
- I see.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:21.913
Well in that case Mike,
I wish you the best man.

01:17:29.255 --> 01:17:30.350
You know, it took a lot of guts for you

01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:32.590
to come over here and
talk to me like a man,

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:34.590
and tell me about the decision you made.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.049
You know Mike, sometimes you
gotta make decisions in life,

01:17:40.049 --> 01:17:42.371
that's either gonna help you or hurt you.

01:17:42.371 --> 01:17:45.384
But at the end of the day,
the decisions you make,

01:17:45.384 --> 01:17:48.033
only you have to deal with them.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.213
- I don't like it, but
I respect it, and you.

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:58.033
I hope you find what
you're looking for Mike.

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.080
- Thanks Coach.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.980
- Hey, and just 'cause you're leaving

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.880
it don't change a thing.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.340
I'm here if you need me.

01:18:08.303 --> 01:18:11.253
All I wanna see is you succeed in life.

01:18:55.121 --> 01:18:58.121
(crickets chirping)

01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:02.400
- Come on D, hear me out.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.620
- For what?

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.913
So you can lie some more?

01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:09.850
Man, I told you not to mess
around with that woman.

01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:12.937
And the situation we got
right now is exactly why.

01:19:12.937 --> 01:19:15.063
- I know man, but you don't understand.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.440
- What I understand is,
not only did you lie

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.029
and go behind my back, you
also went behind Moe back

01:19:21.029 --> 01:19:23.370
and mess around with his Mama.

01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:25.430
And you got her pregnant.

01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:26.840
Man, how do you think that make him feel

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.340
and look in front of his team?

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:32.270
How do you think that make
us look as an organization?

01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:36.230
And we're supposed to be role
models for these young men.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.453
- I'm sorry D.

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:41.603
But it's not like that, I love her.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.800
We been seeing each other for a while now.

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:54.070
We tried to keep it a secret,

01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:56.223
but things just start happening so fast.

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:05.100
- Man, Mike quit the team today.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:05.933
- Straight up?

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.093
Why?

01:20:10.643 --> 01:20:12.605
- He said he had to do what he had

01:20:12.605 --> 01:20:14.105
to do to attract D1 attention.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.530
Look Randy, I know what you're saying

01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:26.530
is probably true and all,
but I can't except that type

01:20:27.707 --> 01:20:30.433
of behavior from a coach
in this organization.

01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:34.965
And we're supposed to be setting examples

01:20:34.965 --> 01:20:36.632
for these young men.

01:20:40.653 --> 01:20:41.820
You know what?

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.000
I'ma have to let you go man.

01:21:07.356 --> 01:21:09.939
(gentle music)

01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:14.010
- [Lora] Dylan, what's wrong?

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:18.013
- How's my baby?

01:21:27.177 --> 01:21:28.938
How's my baby doing?

01:21:28.938 --> 01:21:29.837
(sighs)

01:21:29.837 --> 01:21:30.670
- He's doing good.

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:31.873
How's his daddy doing?

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.300
Dylan you look like you
just lost your best friend.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.823
- Dylan, do you want me to
make you something to eat?

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.670
- No thanks Mama D, I'm
not hungry right now.

01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:45.643
- Dylan, what's wrong?

01:21:46.846 --> 01:21:48.653
- Where do I start?

01:21:53.902 --> 01:21:57.350
Well the good news is, Dana's
son started with us today.

01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:58.623
On a trial basis.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.050
So we'll see how that all shapes out.

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.950
- Well that is good news.

01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:06.000
I'm sure Dana will be happy to hear that.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.140
- And just as I'm introducing
Justin to the team.

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:14.162
Moe comes running in and jumps on Randy,

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.750
for messing with his mother.

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.317
- What?

01:22:17.317 --> 01:22:18.580
- What?

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.047
- Oh, it gets worse.

01:22:21.047 --> 01:22:22.503
He got her pregnant.

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.193
- [Both] What?

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.073
- Oh.

01:22:26.971 --> 01:22:28.509
(laughs)

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:29.342
There's more to it.

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:33.590
Mike comes to me after practice

01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:35.960
and tells me he's going
to play for another team

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.473
so he can get his shine on.

01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:41.280
And, just before I walk in the house,

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.513
I had to let Randy go.

01:22:45.311 --> 01:22:47.911
So yeah, today's been a
pretty messed up day for me.

01:22:50.735 --> 01:22:55.187
Not to mention Nationals is
just a couple of weeks away.

01:22:55.187 --> 01:22:56.020
(sighs)

01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.510
Still gotta get that money for that.

01:22:59.847 --> 01:23:02.797
It's just like everything is
falling apart on me right now.

01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:06.990
- Well now, Dylan have you talked to God

01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:09.593
to see what He has to
say about the situation?

01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:13.500
- Mama D, I ain't had a
chance to talk to no one.

01:23:14.334 --> 01:23:16.160
I mean, this all just happened.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.490
- Come on, get up.

01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:18.790
Let's join hands and we are going

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:20.223
to go to the Lord in prayer.

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.103
- [Lora] You alright there?

01:23:25.103 --> 01:23:27.686
(gentle music)

01:23:28.992 --> 01:23:30.450
- [Diane] Alright.

01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:31.681
Dear Heavenly Father,

01:23:31.681 --> 01:23:34.830
we come to you with humble hearts,

01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:37.513
seeking your wisdom in our time of need.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.700
Father, I ask that you
would bless Dylan and Lora,

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.690
and the child in her womb,

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:48.030
that he may come forth a
healthy and happy baby.

01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:50.930
I ask that you would walk with Dylan

01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:53.823
as he seeks Your will with
mentoring these young men.

01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:57.300
Give them strength God.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.270
Give them Your grace and Your mercy.

01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:03.010
And help them to trust
you, Lord, in all things,

01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:06.193
even those that they may not understand.

01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:10.443
We ask these blessings in
Jesus mighty name, amen.

01:24:12.264 --> 01:24:13.140
- [Both] Amen.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.064
- [Diane] It's gonna be alright.

01:24:15.064 --> 01:24:16.731
- [Dylan] Thank you.

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.233
- Put it on my schedule for
Tuesday and I'll close it.

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:29.783
Yeah.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.113
No problem.

01:24:33.175 --> 01:24:34.008
Bye.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.013
How did things go with your coach?

01:24:40.342 --> 01:24:41.983
- He's pretty cool about it.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.313
- Good, heard about Coach Randy.

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:49.180
Got a call from one of the
parents on my way over here.

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.813
- Yeah, Moe's pretty upset.

01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:54.290
- Yeah, well it just confirms

01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:56.260
that we're doing the right thing.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.935
You need to be part of a team

01:24:57.935 --> 01:24:59.767
that has scandals like
that surrounding it,

01:24:59.767 --> 01:25:01.067
it just doesn't look good.

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.260
Talked to your new coach.

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:06.593
He's really excited about
you coming to the team.

01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:10.293
It's more of a fit for you, alright?

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:12.670
They have a tournament
coming up this weekend,

01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:14.560
so you can start practicing
with them next week.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.513
But until then, I'll do your workouts.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.353
- Yes sir.

01:25:20.503 --> 01:25:22.042
- That's my boy.

01:25:22.042 --> 01:25:24.400
Hey, I know it's tough on you right now,

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.520
but we're doing the right thing.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.403
You'll see, alright?

01:25:35.073 --> 01:25:37.372
(upbeat music)

01:25:37.372 --> 01:25:38.553
- [Stoney] Hello.

01:25:38.553 --> 01:25:39.846
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

01:25:39.846 --> 01:25:41.186
Come on man.

01:25:41.186 --> 01:25:46.186
Let's go, hustle Matthew, come on more.

01:25:47.025 --> 01:25:49.942
(distant shouting)

01:25:58.307 --> 01:25:59.768
Time out.

01:25:59.768 --> 01:26:01.750
(whistle blows)

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:02.850
Hurry up and sit down!

01:26:06.573 --> 01:26:09.123
Stop playing like some
little punks out there.

01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:10.360
We should be blowing this team out.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.099
- Man you tripping, if you
put somebody in the game

01:26:12.099 --> 01:26:14.237
like that too, this big
dumb fool right here.

01:26:14.237 --> 01:26:15.857
- Who the hell you talking to?

01:26:15.857 --> 01:26:16.914
- I'm talking to you--

01:26:16.914 --> 01:26:18.617
- Shut up, I'm talking!

01:26:18.617 --> 01:26:20.673
You stupid little monkeys out there,

01:26:20.673 --> 01:26:22.430
you all better start playing some ball.

01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:24.680
You making me look bad
in front of my people.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.087
Now, I don't care what you
do when you get out there,

01:26:28.087 --> 01:26:30.330
you better not loose, do you hear me?

01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:31.533
Get off my bench.

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:41.200
I see homeboy out there stalling you out.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.220
Next time he do you up, you
pinch him inside his thigh

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.721
so the ref don't see it,

01:26:45.721 --> 01:26:47.207
that way you can get around him.

01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:48.040
- What?

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.056
- Did you, did I stutter?

01:26:49.056 --> 01:26:50.157
- I don't get down like that.

01:26:50.157 --> 01:26:51.648
- Oh, you don't get down like that?

01:26:51.648 --> 01:26:52.481
Hey, hey, hey, Doug?

01:26:52.481 --> 01:26:54.380
Or Stick, check in for
T-Money since he ain't

01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.630
in the right frame of
mind to play this post.

01:26:58.326 --> 01:26:59.159
(banging)

01:26:59.159 --> 01:26:59.992
I kick chairs too.

01:27:04.466 --> 01:27:07.049
(gentle music)

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.220
- Alright fellas, listen up.

01:27:14.773 --> 01:27:16.773
I wanted to bring you guys here tonight,

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.986
because there's been
a lot going on lately,

01:27:19.986 --> 01:27:21.813
that we obviously need to talk about.

01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:26.533
First, I just wanted to let you guys know

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:30.003
that Coach Randy is no longer
a part of this organization.

01:27:30.003 --> 01:27:31.015
- [All] What?

01:27:31.015 --> 01:27:35.233
- I know, just calm down, bear
with me and let me finish.

01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:39.210
Second, Mike is no longer with the team.

01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:40.508
- Come on.

01:27:40.508 --> 01:27:42.423
- He came and told me after last practice.

01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.690
And as we all know Tywan

01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:47.883
is now running with the Infinity Squad.

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.487
So with that being said,

01:27:51.487 --> 01:27:54.857
we obviously have some
major adjustments to make.

01:27:54.857 --> 01:27:58.760
Bur as you all know, one
man don't make a team,

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.420
but by the same token, every man plays

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.933
an important role on any team.

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.040
Fortunately, God is in control

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.683
and He never makes mistakes.

01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:15.010
We still got all the key players we need,

01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:18.522
and I am very thankful for
each and every one of you guys.

01:28:18.522 --> 01:28:20.950
But before I move any further,

01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:24.503
I just want to know, does anyone
else have anything to say?

01:28:30.209 --> 01:28:31.042
Does...

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:33.920
Anyone else wanna leave the team?

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.893
- I'm a Warrior for life Coach.

01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.903
- For life.

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.930
- [All] For life.

01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:49.875
- Hey Coach, I know I'm new,

01:28:49.875 --> 01:28:51.760
but the way I see it,
you took a chance on me,

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.260
so that make me a Warrior too.

01:28:55.404 --> 01:28:56.237
(sighs)

01:28:56.237 --> 01:28:57.070
- Thank you guys.

01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:01.590
Well, now that we gotten
that all out the way.

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:04.427
The national tournament's
only two weeks away.

01:29:04.427 --> 01:29:05.329
- [All] Yeah.

01:29:05.329 --> 01:29:07.599
- Hey, we still got a lot to work on.

01:29:07.599 --> 01:29:08.432
- Yeah.

01:29:08.432 --> 01:29:10.340
- Not to mention the money we still need

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.223
to raise for our travel expenses.

01:29:13.225 --> 01:29:15.720
But I'm not worried.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.280
As you all know, I'm a man of God

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.170
and I try very hard to
run this organization

01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:22.756
in a manner that reflects that.

01:29:22.756 --> 01:29:26.790
My biggest mistake has been
not involving him enough,

01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:28.880
and relying on my own resources

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.282
and ability to make things happen,

01:29:31.282 --> 01:29:34.979
when ultimately without
Him, we're nothing.

01:29:34.979 --> 01:29:39.750
So going forward, I'm gonna
do everything in my power

01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:43.920
to make sure God is a prominent
part in everything we do.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.073
Because without Him, we're nothing.

01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:49.770
In spite of everything
that we've been through,

01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:51.270
He's seen fit to bring each

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:54.750
and every one of us
together, for a purpose.

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:57.690
And I'm very excited about that fellas.

01:29:57.690 --> 01:30:01.794
So going forward, all we gotta
do is continue to work hard,

01:30:01.794 --> 01:30:04.050
and prepare for what lies ahead,

01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:05.960
and trust Him to make a way.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.883
- Amen, Coach.

01:30:09.306 --> 01:30:11.273
- Hey, let's bring it in fellas, come on.

01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:15.660
Warriors on three, one, two, three.

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.220
- [All] Warriors!

01:32:35.084 --> 01:32:35.917
- Yeah.

01:32:41.801 --> 01:32:43.530
- [Junior] Three point drill?

01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:45.300
- [Stoney] Yeah, three
point drill, please.

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.923
I need, put it on the board man.

01:32:49.336 --> 01:32:51.836
No, I ain't, we ain't
talking about layers Junior.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.790
- Stoney?

01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:55.351
- [Stoney] Hey, hey.

01:32:55.351 --> 01:32:56.184
- How you doing man?

01:32:56.184 --> 01:32:57.300
- You alright?

01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:58.730
- [David] This is that high profile player

01:32:58.730 --> 01:33:00.155
I was telling you about.

01:33:00.155 --> 01:33:01.028
(mumbles)

01:33:01.028 --> 01:33:01.861
This is Mike.

01:33:01.861 --> 01:33:02.694
You ready to get that money?

01:33:02.694 --> 01:33:04.380
- Yeah, he's ready to get his money,

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:05.800
that's exactly what we been talking about.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.250
He's been held back a little bit,

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:09.490
if you know what I mean, but
he has a lot of potential man.

01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:11.734
I'm really looking for a
team that can really shine.

01:33:11.734 --> 01:33:14.374
And he's a great shooter,
he's a great defender,

01:33:14.374 --> 01:33:17.647
so happy to be part of this team man.

01:33:17.647 --> 01:33:18.961
- [Stoney] Let's get this money.

01:33:18.961 --> 01:33:20.640
- Get this money, that's
what I wanna talk about.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.723
- That's what I mean.

01:33:21.723 --> 01:33:24.334
- Let's get this money,
that's what I'm interested in.

01:33:24.334 --> 01:33:27.184
(laughing)

01:33:27.184 --> 01:33:30.267
(distant chattering)

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.743
(soft music)

01:33:32.743 --> 01:33:33.826
- What up, T?

01:33:38.694 --> 01:33:42.198
- [Stoney] I don't like
to pinch 'em, but I will.

01:33:42.198 --> 01:33:43.556
- Hey, the last team he was on

01:33:43.556 --> 01:33:45.185
didn't even have shoes to play in man.

01:33:45.185 --> 01:33:46.413
- [Stoney] They didn't
have a lot of money?

01:33:46.413 --> 01:33:47.400
- [David] Embarrassing.

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.600
- Come on buddy, hustle.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.633
- Hey T.

01:33:57.891 --> 01:33:58.724
Hey T.

01:33:59.593 --> 01:34:00.723
Hey T, hold up man.

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:03.680
- What do you want?

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.810
What are you even doing here?

01:34:04.810 --> 01:34:06.480
- Man, I could ask you the same thing.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.010
- Hey, you stopped me,
we ain't gotta talk.

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.560
- Look man, you really need

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.413
to learn how to loosen up, for real.

01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:15.130
My Dad brought me over here.

01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:18.610
He thinks that I can play better

01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:21.580
if I'm out of my box
more with another team.

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:22.620
- Yeah?

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.500
Well everything that glitters ain't gold.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.460
- What do you mean?

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.400
- You'll see.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.500
It's a whole different world over here.

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:32.750
- I can see that, with all the
shoe sponsorships and stuff.

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:35.100
Plus the Infinity Squad
gets a lot of exposure.

01:34:36.007 --> 01:34:39.719
- Like I said, everything
that glitters ain't gold.

01:34:39.719 --> 01:34:43.343
- Look man, can we just call a truce?

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.268
I mean, I know I said some
messed up stuff to you

01:34:47.268 --> 01:34:50.343
in the past, but I really
don't mean nothing by it.

01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:55.381
I mean, why don't we
just bygones be bygones,

01:34:55.381 --> 01:34:57.374
and make it do what it do.

01:34:57.374 --> 01:34:58.983
We already got good court chemistry.

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:01.177
I mean you wanna win right?

01:35:14.384 --> 01:35:16.384
(sighs)

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:22.733
- Hey Ma.

01:35:24.610 --> 01:35:26.150
- Hey.

01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:27.473
How was practice?

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:30.040
- I'm not going back.

01:35:51.584 --> 01:35:54.501
(keyboard tapping)

01:35:58.898 --> 01:36:00.020
(knocking)

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:00.853
- Come in.

01:36:04.561 --> 01:36:05.640
(sighs)

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.943
- Hey D, what's going on?

01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:10.023
- Hey, erm, nothing.

01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.590
What's going on with you?

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:17.153
- I could be better, but I won't complain.

01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:20.403
- Hmm.

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.590
Why don't ya come in and have a seat.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.433
- Thank you.

01:36:29.696 --> 01:36:32.113
(soft music)

01:36:35.777 --> 01:36:37.939
- What's on your mind?

01:36:37.939 --> 01:36:38.856
- I just...

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.490
I just wanted to come over here

01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:45.340
and apologize to you for my behavior.

01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:50.190
We've been coaching
together for five years.

01:36:50.190 --> 01:36:52.147
Been friends longer than that.

01:36:54.378 --> 01:36:58.060
I hate what I did, and I
love coaching those boys.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.980
I want you to know that
what you did was right.

01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.650
But I also need you to know that

01:37:06.650 --> 01:37:09.150
that weren't just some
jump off type of situation.

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.393
Man, I love her.

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:14.020
And I wanna be with her.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.570
- Look Randy, you ain't
gotta explain that--

01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:21.513
- No listen, just let me finish.

01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:25.073
Just let me finish.

01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:30.630
I went over to Candy's
house to talk to her.

01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:32.580
And I had a long conversation with Moe.

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:37.100
I told him that I apologize
for not being up front

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.550
with him about the situation.

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.754
I told him that I love his mother

01:37:42.754 --> 01:37:45.003
and that I wanna be
there for her, and him.

01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:50.030
He had a hard time taking it at first.

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:51.200
But he's started to come around

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.850
after his mother told him
that she felt the same way.

01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:59.020
Look Coach, I'm not
telling you all of this

01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:00.220
for you to take me back.

01:38:01.448 --> 01:38:04.293
I really just wanna make
the situation right.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.320
- I appreciate that man.

01:38:17.005 --> 01:38:18.366
(sighs)

01:38:18.366 --> 01:38:19.603
- I also wanted to give you this.

01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:25.453
- What is this?

01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:27.490
- It's a donation.

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.490
I know you and the guys
have been doing fundraisers

01:38:30.490 --> 01:38:33.793
to raise money for the trip
and I just wanna do my part.

01:38:35.519 --> 01:38:37.123
I know how it can be.

01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:45.070
- Randy, this is $5000 man.

01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:46.660
You about to have baby.

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.850
Man, I can't take this.

01:38:47.850 --> 01:38:50.903
- You can and you will.

01:38:53.150 --> 01:38:56.880
Look, I liquidated some of my 401k,

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:59.383
so it's not gonna hurt me.

01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:02.713
Plus it's the least that I can do.

01:39:04.630 --> 01:39:07.893
Just let me do this, please.

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:13.163
- Thank you man.

01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:20.840
- Just don't tell 'em it's from me.

01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:24.573
Okay, if that's what you want.

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:28.003
- It is.

01:39:30.710 --> 01:39:31.543
Look man...

01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:39.023
- Hey.

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.423
We both about to be daddy's.

01:39:49.426 --> 01:39:51.647
- I know, and I'm scared to death.

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.043
- Don't be man.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:57.663
You will be okay.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:39:59.993
We both will.

01:40:03.142 --> 01:40:04.083
- Thanks.

01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:14.870
(clapping)

01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:16.090
- [Dylan] Last shooter?

01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:17.460
- Me Coach.

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.293
- Alright.

01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:27.480
Alright, alright, bring it in fellas,

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.008
bring it in, bring it in.

01:40:30.008 --> 01:40:31.540
(clapping)

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.763
Hey, great job out there fellas.

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:38.000
I must say, the way you
all been looking lately,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.518
we might mess around and
win us a trophy this year.

01:40:40.518 --> 01:40:43.228
(cheering)

01:40:43.228 --> 01:40:45.260
Alright, alright, quiet down, listen up.

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:47.010
I got us some great news for y'all.

01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:51.000
Due to the blessings of a generous donor,

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.325
we now have the full $5000
we need for Nationals!

01:40:54.325 --> 01:40:56.575
(cheering)

01:40:57.779 --> 01:40:59.860
- Woo, let's go Coach.

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:03.360
(talking over each other)

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:06.893
- Hello?

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.220
Back at the hospital?

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:13.846
Oh, no, no, here I come
now, okay, alright?

01:41:13.846 --> 01:41:16.837
Hey Red, lock it up, lock it
up, I'll talk to you later.

01:41:23.283 --> 01:41:24.116
- Oh god.

01:41:25.876 --> 01:41:27.343
Why?

01:41:27.343 --> 01:41:28.997
(sobbing)

01:41:28.997 --> 01:41:30.105
- Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

01:41:30.105 --> 01:41:31.018
- I just want my baby.

01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:34.746
- I know, I know, we are
gonna get you to the bed.

01:41:34.746 --> 01:41:35.579
- Oh god.

01:41:37.205 --> 01:41:39.372
(mumbles)

01:41:41.437 --> 01:41:43.604
(sobbing)

01:41:47.249 --> 01:41:48.666
- It's okay baby.

01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:57.663
- Oh god.

01:41:59.378 --> 01:42:01.470
- What can I do for you?

01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:03.670
- Just leave me alone, oh god.

01:42:10.447 --> 01:42:11.280
Oh god.

01:42:12.902 --> 01:42:16.069
(slow dramatic music)

01:42:17.843 --> 01:42:19.533
- I don't know what to do.

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:20.390
- Dylan.

01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:21.740
- I don't know what to do.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.227
I can't fix this Mama.

01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:26.920
Why would God take our baby from us, huh?

01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:29.920
Why would he do that to us?

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.970
- Dylan baby, nobody can
answer that question.

01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:35.670
But we know that everything
works according to His will,

01:42:35.670 --> 01:42:40.260
and I know, I know that it's
not always easy to accept.

01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:41.380
But--

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:42.940
- But what?

01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:45.430
My wife is in there crying her eyes out.

01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:49.123
Over the loss of our baby, who
we've waited so long to have.

01:42:49.123 --> 01:42:51.413
And I'm supposed to just accept that?

01:42:52.804 --> 01:42:55.140
- Dylan, I know that this is hard.

01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.760
You have just to have
faith that everything

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.110
will work out for the good.

01:43:00.961 --> 01:43:03.961
- I can't accept this, I just can't.

01:43:05.358 --> 01:43:06.441
- Dylan, I...

01:43:13.337 --> 01:43:16.504
(basketball bouncing)

01:43:18.271 --> 01:43:20.854
(gentle music)

01:44:01.496 --> 01:44:03.669
(groans)

01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:04.502
- Why?

01:44:05.494 --> 01:44:07.001
Why?

01:44:07.001 --> 01:44:09.522
Why did you take my son from me man?

01:44:09.522 --> 01:44:10.355
Again!

01:44:11.535 --> 01:44:13.702
(sobbing)

01:44:20.707 --> 01:44:22.957
(sniffing)

01:44:30.447 --> 01:44:31.280
- Coach.

01:44:35.526 --> 01:44:37.797
- What you doing here?

01:44:37.797 --> 01:44:40.470
- I went by your house
and your mother-in-law

01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:43.010
said I probably could find you here.

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.863
I called some of the guys and...

01:44:47.418 --> 01:44:49.468
Coach, I'm sorry to hear about your baby.

01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:53.397
(sobbing)

01:44:55.021 --> 01:44:56.354
- Well, so am I.

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.993
Sorry you have to see me like this.

01:45:02.153 --> 01:45:04.423
But, now's really not a good time, T.

01:45:05.771 --> 01:45:08.340
- Yeah, I know.

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:11.530
But, I've learned the past
few years, from my coach...

01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:20.830
That we all need help sometimes.

01:45:25.814 --> 01:45:28.231
- Yeah, you right about that.

01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:34.494
T, I don't know how you're gonna be

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.823
able to help me with this one man.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.040
- Yeah, me neither.

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.553
But Coach, I'm willing to try.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.273
I wanna play for you,

01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:46.683
if you'll have me.

01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:50.617
Look, I'm sorry how I left the team,

01:45:50.617 --> 01:45:52.440
but my mom made me do it

01:45:53.942 --> 01:45:56.030
and I couldn't face you or the guys.

01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:59.123
But I quit the Infinity Squad.

01:46:00.678 --> 01:46:03.743
I just wanna come back home Coach.

01:46:07.646 --> 01:46:09.813
(sobbing)

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:12.510
- Come back home man.

01:46:13.869 --> 01:46:15.519
You can always come back home, T.

01:46:22.110 --> 01:46:24.943
(sobbing heavily)

01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:36.530
- [Red] Yo, if anybody ever found out

01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:39.040
I was hugged up crying
with a bunch of dudes,

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:43.183
I swear on everything I love,
I'm lumping all of y'all up.

01:46:44.129 --> 01:46:45.796
- [All] Shut up Red.

01:46:57.493 --> 01:46:59.493
(sighs)

01:47:14.530 --> 01:47:15.520
- Hey.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.353
- Hey.

01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:18.663
How you feeling?

01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:21.243
- A little better.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.313
You?

01:47:24.710 --> 01:47:27.325
- I don't know, I got a lot of things

01:47:27.325 --> 01:47:28.950
going through my head right now.

01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:30.003
- Yeah, me too.

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.754
Dylan, I'm sorry I sent you away.

01:47:35.754 --> 01:47:36.900
- No, don't be--

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:37.733
- No, no.

01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:41.040
We both lost our child,

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:44.120
so it wasn't fair for me
to push you away like that.

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.160
Like I was the only one
going through something.

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:47.460
I know you're hurting too.

01:47:49.078 --> 01:47:51.885
- I'm gonna cancel the tournament.

01:47:51.885 --> 01:47:52.885
- [Lora] No.

01:47:52.885 --> 01:47:54.352
- I need to be here with you.

01:47:54.352 --> 01:47:56.260
- No you can't do that.

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.620
The tournament is in three days.

01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:59.430
You can't do that to those boys.

01:48:04.259 --> 01:48:07.195
- How can I think about
basketball at a time like this?

01:48:07.195 --> 01:48:08.309
- Dylan.

01:48:08.309 --> 01:48:12.287
We both know that everything
happens for a reason.

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.587
And those boys need you.

01:48:15.587 --> 01:48:17.137
You can't pull out on them now.

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:20.493
- What about us?

01:48:21.356 --> 01:48:22.950
I need to be here with you?

01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:23.867
- For what?

01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:28.853
You being here is not
gonna bring the baby back.

01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:35.270
We both just be staring at
each other and moping around,

01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:37.653
no, I cannot let you do that.

01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:42.723
We're going.

01:48:44.396 --> 01:48:46.813
(soft music)

01:48:47.984 --> 01:48:48.817
- We?

01:48:50.547 --> 01:48:52.923
- You're going to coach your team,

01:48:53.823 --> 01:48:57.040
and I'll be in the stands cheering you on.

01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.823
Like a good wife is supposed to.

01:49:01.443 --> 01:49:03.443
(sighs)

01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:06.503
Oh, Dylan.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.013
We may have lost our child,

01:49:11.170 --> 01:49:14.010
but the Lord has seen
fit to give you 10 more.

01:49:17.410 --> 01:49:18.810
- I guess it's settled then.

01:49:20.257 --> 01:49:22.340
We're going to Nationals.

01:49:26.097 --> 01:49:28.764
(lips smacking)

01:49:32.018 --> 01:49:34.601
(upbeat music)

01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:38.798
- Yo, what's up?

01:49:38.798 --> 01:49:39.631
It's your man J-Styles,

01:49:39.631 --> 01:49:41.090
and you know I'm always
where I need to be.

01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:44.016
And today, I'm right
here where I need to be,

01:49:44.016 --> 01:49:45.010
in the International Hyper Arena

01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:46.210
right here in sunny Florida,

01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:47.043
and I know what your thinking,

01:49:47.043 --> 01:49:49.643
yo Jay, is that, is that Young Buck?

01:49:49.643 --> 01:49:52.612
Yes it is man, the legendary Hip Hop icon,

01:49:52.612 --> 01:49:54.260
Young Buck is in the house,

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:56.510
but today he's not coming
as the Hip Hop icon,

01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:58.730
today he's here for the kids as a sponsor.

01:49:58.730 --> 01:50:00.810
Yo, Young Buck, tell them
all about the tournament man.

01:50:00.810 --> 01:50:03.740
- Ah man, I'ma lace y'all straight up.

01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.290
Today's is one of the biggest tournaments

01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:08.520
that we do for the youth in basketball.

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:09.940
Today is the fifth annual

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:13.340
Moneyball National Basketball Tournament.

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:17.520
It's big and I'm here in
search of the baddest 17

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.240
and under squad that's
out there on the court.

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.507
I'm basically coming
to sponsor these kids.

01:50:22.507 --> 01:50:26.707
And when I mean sponsor I'm
talking about traveling,

01:50:26.707 --> 01:50:29.980
uniforms, shoes, the whole nine.

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:31.909
- [Jay] The socks, everything.

01:50:31.909 --> 01:50:33.340
- [Young Buck] Everything,
I wanna just, you know,

01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:36.750
I know it's a lot of
teams that is out here

01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:39.350
trying to make ends meet, but also dealing

01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:41.639
with the financial hardship,

01:50:41.639 --> 01:50:44.220
so I just wanna come in and kind of help

01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:46.460
these kids think out the box.

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.420
I mean, outside of that, we got a lot

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.610
of big college scouts coming,

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:52.720
as well as NBA scouts that are out here.

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.776
So these kids can showcase
their talents in front of them

01:50:55.776 --> 01:50:59.330
and possibly be able to take their talents

01:50:59.330 --> 01:51:01.890
from this court to a college court.

01:51:01.890 --> 01:51:02.740
- And then?

01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:04.668
- To the NBA court, you know,

01:51:04.668 --> 01:51:07.001
so that's the ultimate goal.

01:51:08.092 --> 01:51:10.342
(cheering)

01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:15.220
- Alright fellas, listen up.

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:17.510
No long speeches here today.

01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:21.693
We're here to play basketball,
nothing more, nothing less.

01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.570
Now, each game is a one game elimination

01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:27.530
all the way to the end.

01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:29.810
So y'all know what to do.

01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:33.690
We gotta play hard and
take each game as it come.

01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:34.710
Alright?

01:51:34.710 --> 01:51:36.010
Let's join hands and pray.

01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:40.700
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You Lord

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:42.253
for this blessed fulfilled day.

01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:45.275
Lord, we ask that You walk with us Lord,

01:51:45.275 --> 01:51:47.840
and let Your light to shine down on us

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:51.640
so that we may glorify Your
name in everything we do.

01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:53.623
In Jesus name we pray, amen.

01:51:54.461 --> 01:51:55.936
- [All] Amen.

01:51:55.936 --> 01:51:59.052
(clapping and cheering)

01:51:59.052 --> 01:52:00.250
- Come on, let's go.

01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:02.670
- Alright, listen up fellas, listen up.

01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:05.110
Hey, no matter what the outcome is today,

01:52:05.110 --> 01:52:07.423
I just want you guys to know

01:52:07.423 --> 01:52:10.931
that I love you and I'm very proud of you.

01:52:10.931 --> 01:52:12.866
[All] Love you too Coach.

01:52:12.866 --> 01:52:14.460
- I love you too Coach.

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:16.373
- So let's go out here

01:52:16.373 --> 01:52:18.529
and let's play some Warrior basketball.

01:52:18.529 --> 01:52:20.461
(cheering)

01:52:20.461 --> 01:52:21.835
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.495
- Weigh us in, Alex, weigh us in baby.

01:52:23.495 --> 01:52:24.661
- [Alex] Who are we?
- [All] Warriors.

01:52:24.661 --> 01:52:25.952
- [Alex] Who are we?
- [All] Warriors.

01:52:25.952 --> 01:52:27.368
- [Alex] What do we do?
- [All] Work hard, get better.

01:52:27.368 --> 01:52:29.034
- [Alex] What do we do?
- [All] Work hard, get better.

01:52:29.034 --> 01:52:31.057
(cheering)

01:52:31.057 --> 01:52:33.307
(clapping)

01:52:41.995 --> 01:52:45.245
(upbeat hip hop music)

01:53:33.124 --> 01:53:36.693
(distant chattering)

01:53:36.693 --> 01:53:38.410
- Hold up, hold up, wait.

01:53:38.410 --> 01:53:42.740
Well, well, well, if it
ain't the long lost T-Money.

01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:44.220
How you doing bro?

01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.620
Nah for real, what's up bro?

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:48.633
Oh, it's like that?

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.425
Okay, that's what's up, we all know

01:53:51.425 --> 01:53:53.673
you the choker that's on the team anyway.

01:53:53.673 --> 01:53:54.541
(laughing)

01:53:54.541 --> 01:53:57.166
But dig this though, we gonna
keep moms on speed dial.

01:53:57.166 --> 01:53:59.906
(shouting over each other)

01:53:59.906 --> 01:54:01.260
- Hey yo, hey yo, hey you.

01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:02.470
chill out, chill out yo.

01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:04.620
Hey, yo, don't even sweat it.

01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:07.390
We'll get this one later,
after he get his teeth fixed.

01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:10.158
Looking like he got hit in the
mouth with a bag of gravel.

01:54:10.158 --> 01:54:11.303
(laughing)

01:54:11.303 --> 01:54:12.920
- [Dante] That was lame, that was lame.

01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:13.901
- What?

01:54:13.901 --> 01:54:15.026
Y'all don't want none of this man.

01:54:15.026 --> 01:54:16.290
- Check this out, y'all need to practice.

01:54:16.290 --> 01:54:19.010
Go ahead, Warriors.

01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:20.340
- Let's go man.

01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:21.530
- Don't worry about them man.
- Hey bro, follow through.

01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:23.433
Okay, follow through.

01:54:23.433 --> 01:54:24.871
- [Justin] See you on the court bro.

01:54:24.871 --> 01:54:27.121
- [Dante] Warriors, ha, ha.

01:54:28.337 --> 01:54:29.453
- Hey yo, Mike?

01:54:30.304 --> 01:54:31.573
Is this really what you want man?

01:54:32.992 --> 01:54:36.075
(distant chattering)

01:54:37.663 --> 01:54:40.246
(gentle music)

01:54:46.768 --> 01:54:47.760
(laughs)

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.833
- I gotta admit, I didn't see that coming.

01:54:51.308 --> 01:54:54.260
You know what D, I wanna thank you.

01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:57.410
I got a lot of good
players from you this year.

01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:59.453
Too bad your boy Tywan didn't work out.

01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:02.040
I see how he came crawling back

01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.370
to you after he couldn't handle

01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:06.013
the pressure of playing
with an elite squad.

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:12.033
It's all good though, Mike's
working out much better.

01:55:13.170 --> 01:55:14.003
Yeah.

01:55:18.139 --> 01:55:22.222
- You know Stoney, you
have yourself a good game.

01:55:26.536 --> 01:55:28.703
(giggles)

01:55:30.869 --> 01:55:31.702
- Hmm.

01:55:32.852 --> 01:55:35.275
(cheering)

01:55:35.275 --> 01:55:38.025
(dramatic music)

01:55:40.610 --> 01:55:43.140
- Alright fellas, this is it.

01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:45.630
You guys fought hard to get here,

01:55:45.630 --> 01:55:48.497
and now it's time to fight
even harder to take it home.

01:55:48.497 --> 01:55:50.660
I want you guys to go out there

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:53.500
and leave everything
you got on that floor.

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.717
Understood?

01:55:54.717 --> 01:55:55.550
- [All] Yes Coach.

01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:57.200
- No regrets.

01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.790
'Cause right now it's either

01:55:58.790 --> 01:56:01.510
go hard or go home empty handed.

01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:03.390
And I don't know about you guys,

01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:05.660
but we've all been through way too much

01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:09.314
and have worked way too hard
to go home empty handed.

01:56:09.314 --> 01:56:10.212
Am I right?

01:56:10.212 --> 01:56:11.059
- [All] Yes Coach!

01:56:11.059 --> 01:56:11.892

01:56:17.953 --> 01:56:20.670
They really think they got
a chance at beating us.

01:56:20.670 --> 01:56:22.990
That's not gonna happen, not here today.

01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:25.230
We will not be losing to weaklings,

01:56:25.230 --> 01:56:27.160
do y'all understand me?

01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:28.117

01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:31.074
We got to win.

01:56:31.074 --> 01:56:32.498
Okay, let's do this.

01:58:06.658 --> 01:58:08.075

01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:11.117

Alright fellas listen up,

01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:20.320
man to man the whole game, alright?

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:22.210
So we're gonna have to play smart

01:58:22.210 --> 01:58:23.730
and create some more opportunities.

01:58:23.730 --> 01:58:26.600
- I don't even know why
they only losing by three.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.455
Y'all need to step it up out there.

01:58:28.455 --> 01:58:29.590
- [Dylan] One, two, three.

01:58:29.590 --> 01:58:31.066

- Defense Doug, defense Doug, for real.

01:59:09.058 --> 01:59:12.893
- Come on fellas, we gotta rebound.

01:59:22.170 --> 01:59:23.003
- Come on.

01:59:24.343 --> 01:59:25.975

01:59:31.826 --> 01:59:34.370
- Man, you guys gotta
rebound better out there.

01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:36.890
You gotta box out,
that's what we teach you,

01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:38.200
come on now fellas.

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:39.730
- How many times I gotta tell y'all,

01:59:39.730 --> 01:59:41.850
do not let them shoot, okay?

01:59:41.850 --> 01:59:44.670
When I say lock it down, I
mean lock everything down.

01:59:44.670 --> 01:59:46.807
Don't let them get nothing
passed y'all, alright?

01:59:46.807 --> 01:59:48.810
This a no flag zone, y'all making me

01:59:48.810 --> 01:59:50.120

we'll got a box-in-one this time, alright?

01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:56.450
- On hoods, y'all let another person

01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:59.036
go passed three of y'all
for another easy layup

01:59:59.036 --> 02:00:02.400
and everybody walking
home, I swear on my mama.

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.743

02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:48.657
Good job out there.

02:01:48.657 --> 02:01:50.560
Way to move that ball around.

Hey, but now we're heading
down that final stretch.

like this, playtime is over.

you look for the stick,

02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:03.800
you do that, okay?

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:06.620
They wanna play too close,
you make 'em feel it.

02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:07.903
If they wanna post you
up, you make 'em feel it.

02:02:53.273 --> 02:02:54.560
They're playing dirty out there.

02:02:55.675 --> 02:02:57.620
That was intentional foul ref.

02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:58.658
- Get back to your bench.

02:02:58.658 --> 02:02:59.626

before I issue a technical foul.

call the dog on foul.

to go boys, let's go.

02:04:06.344 --> 02:04:08.380
- Fellas look, they're getting
flustered out there now.

02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:10.870
Alright, so they're about
to start playing dirty.

02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:12.941
Look, I already know how Stoney gets down.

02:04:12.941 --> 02:04:15.520
Y'all see the refs aren't
helping us out or nothing.

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:17.400
So we gotta go out there, play smart,

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.490
and let's just get the job done, okay?

02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:20.930

wrong with you all today,

02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:22.130
but y'all better get it together

02:04:22.130 --> 02:04:23.840
and you better get it together fast.

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:26.210
Now I need my three point
shooters out there stepping up.

02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:28.550
Run Red Robin and get the
ball out to the perimeter.

02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:38.960
that Justin kid, okay?

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.623
I need you whenever you can,
get a few shots in on the kid,

02:04:41.623 --> 02:04:44.080
just try to make sure
the ref don't see it.

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:44.913
- Hang on, what?

02:04:44.913 --> 02:04:46.550
- You head me boy, what
the hell did I say?

02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:47.730
You get out there and do what I tell you,

02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:49.735
you wanna be D1 don't you?

02:04:49.735 --> 02:04:52.520
Okay, yeah, you do what I
tell, I hold your ticket.

but we're better than that,
we're better than that.

We're not gonna let these refs beat us,

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:09.400
and we show that we're not
gonna let them beat us.

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:10.670

You either go hard or
you go home empty handed.

02:07:13.170 --> 02:07:14.860
So what's it gonna be, huh?

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.390
- We want it Coach, we want it bad.

02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:18.594
- Well then go get it then.

02:07:18.594 --> 02:07:19.427
- Come on!

02:07:19.427 --> 02:07:20.361
(cheering)

02:07:20.361 --> 02:07:21.870
- It's time to turn it up fellas.

02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:24.980
This the last minute and a
half, so make 'em feel it.

02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:25.813
Let's go!

02:07:26.824 --> 02:07:30.050
Come here, what did I tell you to do?

02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:32.010
- Man, Coach, I don't get down like that.

02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:33.760
I wanna win, but not like that.

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:35.680
- Oh, you don't get down like that?

02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:37.980
Okay, well I hope you enjoy
the view from the bench,

02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:39.840
and watch your whole
dreams of playing D ball

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:41.580
go down the drain, park it.

02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:44.947
- Jay, check in for Mikey boy here.

02:07:44.947 --> 02:07:47.614
(whistle blows)

02:07:49.912 --> 02:07:50.745
- Is he?

02:07:52.941 --> 02:07:54.774
Stoney, I know he not.

02:07:56.423 --> 02:07:58.095
You can't take him away now.

02:07:58.095 --> 02:07:58.995
Stoney!

02:07:58.995 --> 02:08:02.218
He cannot take him out right
now, he cannot take him out.

02:08:02.218 --> 02:08:03.542
Damn.

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:05.792
(cheering)

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:09.595

02:08:11.272 --> 02:08:12.105
(whistle blows)

02:08:12.105 --> 02:08:14.437

02:08:16.834 --> 02:08:19.751
(distant shouting)

02:08:25.828 --> 02:08:28.154
(clapping)

02:08:28.154 --> 02:08:30.138
- Oh, check it out, check it out.

02:08:30.138 --> 02:08:31.305
- Come on man.

02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:35.247
(whistle blows)

02:08:42.892 --> 02:08:44.059
- Come on boy.

02:08:51.783 --> 02:08:54.700
It's called a rebound for a reason.

02:09:02.922 --> 02:09:05.145
(whistle blows)

02:09:05.145 --> 02:09:06.819
- You didn't see that, come on now.

02:09:06.819 --> 02:09:09.819
- Come on, someone's gonna get hurt.

02:09:13.627 --> 02:09:15.290
Take your time Moe, come on baby,

02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:17.367

02:09:39.635 --> 02:09:41.802

02:09:51.251 --> 02:09:52.418
- Come on man!

02:09:53.646 --> 02:09:55.566
You can't be serious!

02:09:55.566 --> 02:09:56.399
Damn!
