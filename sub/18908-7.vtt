WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:06.640
.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.341
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.311
- We can trust him.
He can help.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.813
- This column means
that he's at a labor camp.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.083
I'll be right back.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.155
- So we were able to isolate
the sound that we're hearing.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.723
[eerie humming]
- Seems to have

00:22.756 --> 00:25.193
mathematical structure,
but otherwise inconclusive.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.196
- I need you to find me
an audio engineer.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.065
- There is a special shipment
coming through your camp.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.833
It's headed off planet.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.536
- My responsibility
is to Gracie and her studies,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.805
and to teach her,
I need a sound environment.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.807
- Get out of my house.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.343
- Where are you going?
- My kid is sick.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.078
- Broussard--
one of his cell

00:44.112 --> 00:46.080
came knocking on my door,
asking for help.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.415
- That's not your problem.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.317
- It is if they
take him to a hospital.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.751
- BB?
- He was exposed to something.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.220
[gunshot]

00:52.253 --> 00:53.721
Your whole cell
almost fell apart today.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.189
You need to get
your house in order

00:55.223 --> 00:57.258
before it comes down
on all of us.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.094
[man and woman moaning]

01:00.128 --> 01:04.198
- That's it--like that.
[moaning]

01:04.232 --> 01:06.767
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Can we stop?

01:06.800 --> 01:10.504
Can we stop? Stop.
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.112
- [gasping]

01:18.146 --> 01:21.749
[inhales deeply]

01:21.782 --> 01:24.852
- Breathe.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.787
- I'm sorry.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.591
- Don't be.
You were great.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.902
We should get up.
I wouldn't want you to be late.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.272
- Let's--let's just--
let's just--

01:44.305 --> 01:46.507
A little--
a little while longer.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.277
- Nothing would be better.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.345
But you need to get going.

01:51.379 --> 01:55.716
[clears throat,
exhales sharply]

01:57.651 --> 01:59.153
It's okay
if you're nervous.

01:59.187 --> 02:02.423
- [breathes deeply]
- It's a big day.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.293
- I'm not sure if I can--
- Hey...

02:05.326 --> 02:07.828
This isn't
about anything else.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.731
It's about me
and you, right?

02:11.932 --> 02:15.169
- Right.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.205
[smooches]

02:23.411 --> 02:26.380
[serious music]

02:26.414 --> 02:33.387
*

02:33.421 --> 02:35.489
- To liberty.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.413
[indistinct chatter]

03:05.919 --> 03:12.960
*

03:14.595 --> 03:16.430
- Oh.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.638
[dog barking]

03:24.672 --> 03:28.242
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

03:28.276 --> 03:30.311
- Next.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.313
- Let's go. Let's go.

03:32.346 --> 03:35.816
- ID?
- What's the holdup?

03:37.785 --> 03:39.387
- Next!

03:39.420 --> 03:40.921
- [wheezing]

03:40.954 --> 03:43.491
- ID?

03:43.524 --> 03:46.927
- This one's clear.
[dog panting]

03:46.960 --> 03:49.263
Have your IDs
and papers ready.

03:49.297 --> 03:52.533
- Arms up.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.269
- Shit.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.405
Sorry.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.408
[dramatic music]

04:00.441 --> 04:02.410
*

04:02.443 --> 04:05.279
- All right. Clear.
- [breathing shakily]

04:05.313 --> 04:07.548
- Are you okay?

04:07.581 --> 04:10.951
- [wheezing]

04:10.984 --> 04:13.287
- Next!

04:13.321 --> 04:15.956
*

04:15.989 --> 04:17.891
All right, this one's good.
- Sorry.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.529
[dog barking]

04:21.562 --> 04:24.432
- Hey!
Stop, right now!

04:24.465 --> 04:25.833
Hands, put your hands up!

04:25.866 --> 04:27.034
- Don't move!

04:27.067 --> 04:29.370
[dog barking]
- Get his papers.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.705
- I made a mista--mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.941
[dog barking]
- Get on the ground, now!

04:33.974 --> 04:35.443
Get on the ground!

04:35.476 --> 04:37.044
- Please, I don't want--
I don't--

04:37.077 --> 04:40.348
[device beeping]

04:44.552 --> 04:48.422
[people screaming]

04:48.456 --> 04:51.625
- He didn't reach the target,
but it's done.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.996
[dramatic music]

04:56.029 --> 05:00.401
*

05:01.635 --> 05:04.338
[dog panting]

05:04.372 --> 05:08.008
- They're gonna want to know
where I was yesterday.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.110
- Can't you tell them
that you were working on a case?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.480
- [sighs]
I can't get a cup of coffee

05:12.513 --> 05:15.082
without them
asking questions.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.351
- But you'll be okay, right?
They need you.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.387
- Till they don't.

05:22.523 --> 05:26.093
- So what do you
want to do about Bram?

05:26.126 --> 05:28.496
- Now you have to fill out
an application at work

05:28.529 --> 05:30.464
just to get on a computer.

05:30.498 --> 05:34.101
I can't open that file
without causing more problems.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.641
- My friends could
probably open it.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.110
They're good at
that sort of thing.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.784
- All right, see what they
can do with it.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.586
- You sure?

05:52.620 --> 05:55.556
- It's for Bram, right?
- That's all I care about.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.794
- And you be careful.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.965
- Okay.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.736
- I'm disappointed.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.671
Maybe I shouldn't have
expected so much,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.039
but before you returned

06:12.072 --> 06:13.741
from your sabbatical,

06:13.774 --> 06:15.509
all I heard about

06:15.543 --> 06:19.046
was the illustrious
Detective Bowman.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.750
You haven't come
as advertised.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.885
- I've been on a short leash.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.895
- Suicide bomber hit one of the
Green Zone gates this morning.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.097
The details fit
with the methodology

06:37.130 --> 06:39.166
of this "Red Hand" group.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.101
Our surveillance found footage

06:41.134 --> 06:43.103
of the bomber at a cafÃ©
two days ago.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.573
He was sitting with that woman--
Frankie Brun.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.575
We cross-indexed her face
and discovered

06:47.608 --> 06:48.942
that she also met
with a bomber

06:48.976 --> 06:50.978
who detonated himself
in our lobby.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.582
That girl is our way
into the cell.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.750
Squeeze her family
and friends.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.022
Hopefully you can produce
something.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.595
- [sighs]

07:07.628 --> 07:10.130
- You're on a short leash
because of your methods.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.965
- I just have a different way
of doing things.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.067
- You signed a vehicle
out of the motor pool yesterday.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.004
- Yeah, I needed a car.
- And you logged 38 miles.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.939
Seems like a lot
for one sick kid.

07:18.972 --> 07:22.075
- I wanted to follow up
on a lead while I was out.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.144
- If there's been
some developments on our case,

07:24.177 --> 07:25.879
I need to be
aware of them.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.981
- Didn't want to bother you
with it unless it was real.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.116
Turned out to be nothing.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.018
- Tell me about it.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.955
- Do you tell me
everything you do?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.925
Guess we're both getting used
to this partnership.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.064
[crackling]

07:50.303 --> 07:52.105
[knock at door]

07:52.139 --> 07:53.907
[gun cocks]

08:02.683 --> 08:04.518
- How's everybody doing?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.755
- Any heat on Will?

08:07.788 --> 08:11.925
- Nothing yet.
[door closes]

08:11.959 --> 08:14.061
- What's on your mind?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.930
- I have a file from
the Deputy Proxy's Office.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.632
It's protected,
but it's got all kinds

08:18.666 --> 08:22.069
of population data on the bloc,
including information

08:22.102 --> 08:25.205
on where my eldest son, Bram,
is being held.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.642
- How do you know what's
on the file if it's protected?

08:28.676 --> 08:31.812
- Because my sister
showed it to me.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.647
All I want's
the information on my boy.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.149
You can do whatever you want
with whatever else is on here.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.952
- Shouldn't be too hard.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.696
- Couldn't have been easy
getting that.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.932
- I took a risk
for my son.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.667
[keys clacking]

08:53.701 --> 08:56.870
I'll be grateful
for whatever you can do.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.141
- We'll be in touch.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.580
[door closes]

09:06.614 --> 09:09.583
[dramatic music]

09:09.617 --> 09:15.122
*

09:15.155 --> 09:17.290
- [gasps]

09:43.150 --> 09:46.186
[both moaning]

09:53.927 --> 09:56.930
[panting]

09:59.933 --> 10:02.002
- Sorry, I didn't, uh--

10:02.035 --> 10:04.304
- Hey, it's okay.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.840
I need you to get
Snyder's key card.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.943
- What?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.915
- We have a Redhat.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.151
We need you to take
a meeting with Snyder.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.287
When you go in there,
he'll get him out of the room,

10:20.320 --> 10:23.657
and you grab
his access card.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.992
Okay?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.336
[machinery whirring loudly]

10:49.717 --> 10:52.352
- Some tea for everyone.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.087
- Well, we'd like
to help, detectives.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.089
Just tell us
what we can do.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.060
- When's the last time
you saw your niece Frankie?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.696
- Oh, I-I really
couldn't say.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.832
- Uh, maybe once or twice
since the Arrival.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.934
Why?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.836
- We have reason to believe
she's involved

11:08.869 --> 11:10.704
with the Resistance.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.040
- Oh, my.

11:13.073 --> 11:16.176
Well, I hope you find her.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.811
- Order and duty.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.447
For a strong colony,
every citizen must do his part.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.883
- Yeah, order and duty.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.725
- I want you to understand
you can't protect Frankie.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.393
The people I work for
see and hear everything,

11:33.426 --> 11:36.129
so it's only a matter of time
before they find her.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.932
But right now
you could still help her.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.233
- Well...

11:40.267 --> 11:43.003
if Frankie got in league
with some terrorists,

11:43.036 --> 11:48.275
then she deserves
what's coming to her.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.277
- Don't you at least want
to know what she did?

11:50.310 --> 11:52.412
- You wouldn't be here
if she didn't do

11:52.445 --> 11:54.214
something illegal.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.389
- Excuse me.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.158
[sighs]

12:05.192 --> 12:07.127
This is a dead end.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.197
They're nervous as cats,
but they don't know anything.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.269
- Maybe we could get, uh,
a message to her,

12:16.303 --> 12:17.771
if you want to come back.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.974
[phone dialing, line trilling]

12:23.210 --> 12:25.012
- We're ready, sir.
Go ahead.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.513
- It's for you.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.981
- Who is it?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.883
- It's your grandkids--
Jonah and Bella.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.552
They're with
some friends of ours.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.222
We'd like to know where
your niece might be hiding.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.961
- Jonah?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.064
- Jesus Christ,
their grandkids?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.399
- We stand on the line
between order and chaos.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.468
Start making compromises,
and you put us all

12:48.501 --> 12:50.871
in the path to anarchy.
- You set me up.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.407
- No, I put a contingency
in place in the event

12:54.441 --> 12:56.076
your methods failed.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.445
You saw through their
cheap theater just like I did.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.081
You knew that they were lying,
and yet you didn't press,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.083
but what I don't know...

13:03.116 --> 13:05.819
is whether
it's because you're soft

13:05.853 --> 13:08.355
or because
you're subversive.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.391
But I plan on finding out.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.829
- You keep digging, Bob.
See what you get.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.065
- I don't think you realize
how lucky we are

13:18.098 --> 13:21.234
to be doing
this job, Detective.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.837
If you lack the necessary
commitment to do our work,

13:23.871 --> 13:26.506
I'm sure that we can find
a more devoted replacement.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.509
[dramatic music]

13:37.517 --> 13:37.918
.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.785
- Would you give us a minute?
- Mm-hmm.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.991
- What's wrong?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.492
- A sensitive file
was downloaded

13:45.525 --> 13:48.261
from my office computer the
night of the unveiling party.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.997
- How do you know?

13:50.030 --> 13:54.367
- I had a nice little visit
from the Intelligence Ministry.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.003
Whenever anything's
downloaded

13:56.036 --> 13:57.637
from the Authority's
central server,

13:57.670 --> 13:58.638
they get pinged.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.008
They weren't happy.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.076
- You didn't download it?
- Nope.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.277
- Then who?
- I don't know.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.913
I thought you might.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.082
- You think it's my fault?

14:09.116 --> 14:11.151
I mean, there were a lot of
people at that dinner party.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.887
We always have staff
in the house.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.355
- That file
contained information

14:15.388 --> 14:18.058
on prisoner allocations.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.997
It's a significant
security breach.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.633
I need to know if anybody
was in my office that night.

14:26.666 --> 14:30.303
- How should I know?

14:30.337 --> 14:31.671
[footsteps approaching]

14:31.704 --> 14:34.674
[dramatic music]

14:34.707 --> 14:41.681
*

14:41.714 --> 14:44.051
- You know what? I'm good.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.919
Thank you.

14:45.953 --> 14:52.960
*

14:59.732 --> 15:01.334
- What's wrong?

15:01.368 --> 15:04.004
- They're gonna hurt me.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.940
- And why would they do that?

15:06.974 --> 15:10.610
- I think they know
that I'm talking to you.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.712
- Why would they care...

15:12.745 --> 15:15.515
unless, of course,
they're planning something?

15:17.184 --> 15:20.487
[door opens, closes]

15:20.520 --> 15:22.089
Not now.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.958
- Sorry, sir,
but this is important.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.368
[door opens, closes]

15:35.402 --> 15:38.371
[suspenseful music]

*

15:45.145 --> 15:48.448
[door opens, closes]

15:48.481 --> 15:52.285
- Idiots.
I'm dealing with idiots.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.724
W-what are you doing?

15:57.757 --> 16:00.760
- If I tell you what they're
doing and you catch them,

16:00.793 --> 16:04.197
will you send me home?

16:04.231 --> 16:07.300
- I promise I'll do
everything I can.

16:09.702 --> 16:13.273
- They're planning
an escape.

16:13.306 --> 16:17.777
- When?
- During our shift today.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.313
They're gonna
make a run at the fence.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.287
- Hey.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.189
What's wrong?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.262
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Aunt Maddie.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.165
- Hey, you mind giving
your mom and I a minute to talk?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.172
Thanks.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.639
- So what do you want to do?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.241
- Uh, I don't know.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.314
- What's up?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.715
- If you wanted to know
more about Bram,

16:55.748 --> 16:57.517
all you had to do was ask.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.422
- What are you
talking about?

17:02.455 --> 17:05.825
- I know you took the file.

17:05.858 --> 17:10.397
- What file?

17:10.430 --> 17:13.266
- The one I showed you
in Nolan's office.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.834
You triggered some sort
of security thing,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.837
and now the Authority
is asking questions.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.673
- Mad, you had, like, a dozen
people at your house that night.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.109
Why are you blaming me?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.678
- You expect me to believe
that someone else

17:25.712 --> 17:28.281
snuck into that office
and stole the exact file

17:28.315 --> 17:29.449
we happened to be looking at?

17:29.482 --> 17:31.351
- Maybe you downloaded it
by accident?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.487
- Oh, so I'm an idiot?
- Look...

17:34.521 --> 17:36.356
I'm sorry you and Nolan
are in trouble,

17:36.389 --> 17:40.160
but I didn't take anything
from your house.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.262
I wouldn't do that.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.836
- Fine.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.378
But, Katie,
this thing with Lindsey...

17:58.411 --> 18:01.781
for your sake,
for how it looks,

18:01.814 --> 18:05.318
you have got to
work things out with her.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.519
With what's happening,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.521
you do not want
any extra attention.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.724
- You're right. I'll, um--
yeah, I'll go speak with her,

18:11.758 --> 18:13.393
and I'll ask her
to come back.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.863
Thank you
for looking out for me.

- Back on 6, take the house!

18:52.332 --> 18:53.566
- Clear!
- Move!

18:53.600 --> 18:54.634
- Go around the back, now!

18:54.667 --> 18:56.569

Who runs your cell?

Who runs your cell?

You asshole.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.509
[gunshot]

21:03.363 --> 21:03.563
.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.163
- A year ago,
I was homeless

21:05.732 --> 21:07.700
and in desperate need
of medical care for my son.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.002
I wasn't sure I was gonna
be able to navigate

21:10.036 --> 21:12.839
my way through it all.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.707
- If you find
yourself adrift,

21:14.741 --> 21:17.410
in search of knowledge,

21:17.444 --> 21:22.315
community.
or spiritual peace...

21:22.349 --> 21:24.984
we say, "Welcome home."

21:25.017 --> 21:27.987
[cheerful music]

21:28.020 --> 21:30.590
- Thank you so much
for joining us

21:30.623 --> 21:33.593
at The Greatest Day Wilshire
Boulevard Congregation.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.029
We hope you will make
our home your home.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.866
- You will not believe.

21:39.899 --> 21:44.404
They are very dangerous
to you and to your family.

21:46.606 --> 21:51.010
You need to name them,
cast them out.

21:51.043 --> 21:54.647
They cannot be trusted
to do what's right.

21:54.681 --> 21:58.385
Okay, let's take a seat and
read chapter five, all right?

22:02.489 --> 22:04.791
Mrs. Bowman.
- Hi, Lindsey.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.059
- Did you come
for the service?

22:07.093 --> 22:10.663
- Uh, I came to apologize.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.466
I completely overreacted
to the situation.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.736
I know you were just trying to
do what's best for the children.

22:16.769 --> 22:20.473
And...Gracie misses you,

22:20.507 --> 22:24.911
and we'd love for you
to come back to the house.

22:24.944 --> 22:28.748
- I've actually
been expecting you.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.483
- [chuckles]
- It's natural

22:30.517 --> 22:33.920
to feel resistance to the truth
of The Greatest Day.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.923
After all,
faith is about struggle,

22:36.956 --> 22:38.658
and I see how hard
you've been struggling

22:38.691 --> 22:41.494
to accept your new reality,

22:41.528 --> 22:43.796
but I want to assure you,
Mrs. Bowman,

22:43.830 --> 22:47.500
that I'm not just there
to help Gracie and Charlie.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.502
I'm there for you, too.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.907
- I'm so glad.

22:54.941 --> 22:57.977
[dog barking in the distance]

23:04.116 --> 23:06.853
[knock at door]

23:10.623 --> 23:12.592

23:12.625 --> 23:13.960
- You're Bonham?

23:13.993 --> 23:16.095
- Yes, sir.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.565
- There a problem?

23:18.598 --> 23:20.533
- No.
[chuckles]

23:20.567 --> 23:22.802
Phew.
Sorry, just a big fan.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.539
- I don't have much time.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.841
Hennessey said you might
have something.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.977
- Mm.
More than something.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.479
Come on.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.850
You are a younger man.

23:37.884 --> 23:41.721
Any chance you remember
the Apollo 10 mission?

23:41.754 --> 23:45.024
Nah.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.860
[eerie music]
May 18, 1969--

23:47.894 --> 23:50.863
the fourth manned mission
to the moon.

23:50.897 --> 23:54.734
NASA still hasn't figured out
the source.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.638
Lots of conspiracy theories.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.139
Here's your file.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.974
The instant I heard it,
I recognized the similarities.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.511
The Apollo riff
had a much slower tempo,

24:04.544 --> 24:06.913
but digging in,
both recordings

24:06.946 --> 24:10.717
have the same basic
wave structure.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.585
And here's where
it gets real weird.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.987
Both have a degrading
time signature embedded

24:15.021 --> 24:16.623
in their audio spectrums.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.124
- Meaning what?
- If you play them out

24:18.157 --> 24:20.860
long enough, they'll eventually
come to an end.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.995
- Like a countdown.
- Bingo.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.164
And here's the kicker--
that old Apollo recording

24:25.197 --> 24:30.036
was counting down to something,
to a very specific moment.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.805
- The Arrival.
- That's right.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.578
So what is this new music
counting down to?

24:50.222 --> 24:51.558
- How did it go?

24:55.995 --> 24:58.531
- He'll know it's gone.

24:58.565 --> 25:01.300
- He won't have time to know.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.802
- What about after?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.837
When Snyder finds
that key card missing,

25:04.871 --> 25:07.106
I'm the first one
he'll throw in solitary.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.075
- Haven't you ever wanted
to be a part of something

25:09.108 --> 25:11.578
bigger than yourself?

25:11.611 --> 25:13.846
This is your chance.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.656
I saw something in you.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.559
The moment I first saw you
on that bus,

25:26.593 --> 25:28.961
I knew you were one of us.

25:28.995 --> 25:33.099
[dramatic music]

25:33.132 --> 25:34.701
- What do I need to do?

25:34.734 --> 25:41.741
*

25:54.887 --> 25:58.157
- Our group has a tradition.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.860
Before our missions,
we make a toast.

26:00.893 --> 26:07.900
*

26:12.739 --> 26:15.274
To liberty.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.343
- To liberty.

26:24.316 --> 26:28.721
[electricity crackling,
Frankie screaming]

26:28.755 --> 26:32.792
[gasping]
- Just answer the question.

26:32.825 --> 26:36.929
[electricity crackling,
Frankie screaming]

26:36.963 --> 26:41.901
[crying]
- One question, one answer,

26:41.934 --> 26:43.169
and this all ends.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.404
Who runs your cell?

26:45.437 --> 26:49.275
- I told you!
I don't know!

26:54.113 --> 26:57.216
[electricity crackling]
- [screaming]

27:01.353 --> 27:04.323
- That's it. You're killing her.
Back off.

27:04.356 --> 27:07.794
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Frankie.
- [crying]

27:07.827 --> 27:11.097
- Try to breathe
evenly, okay?

27:11.130 --> 27:15.434
- Who are you,
the good cop?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.770
- Right now
I'm your only friend.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.908
You have to give them
something.

27:21.941 --> 27:25.044
This won't stop until you do.

27:25.077 --> 27:29.816
- I don't know
who runs the cell.

27:29.849 --> 27:34.353
I'm a recruiter.
That's it.

27:34.386 --> 27:39.058
- Who are you recruiting?
How are you recruiting them?

27:39.091 --> 27:41.961
- Boys.
[breathing shakily]

27:41.994 --> 27:45.131
I find kids
at the end of their rope,

27:45.164 --> 27:48.367
and I take them to bed.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.836
- Well, you must have
a handler,

27:49.869 --> 27:52.839
someone who gives you
these attack targets.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.106
- [gasps, breathing shakily]

27:54.140 --> 27:56.108
- Hey, breathe, come on.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.677
Hey, hey.
Hey, come on.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.114
I think she's in AFib.

28:02.148 --> 28:05.051
[grunting]
- Don't do that.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.957
- Come on.
Come on, breathe.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.492
- Hey, step away
from the suspect.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.227
- Put your hand on me again.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.234
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no! Come on!

28:22.268 --> 28:23.903
Come on, no!

28:23.936 --> 28:26.272
Come on, no, come on!

28:26.305 --> 28:28.040
Come on!

28:28.074 --> 28:29.776
Come on!

28:29.809 --> 28:33.412
- [breathing rapidly]

28:33.445 --> 28:36.282
- No.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.284
Call a medic!

28:38.317 --> 28:40.853
- [sighs]

28:40.887 --> 28:42.789

29:09.148 --> 29:09.348

29:09.381 --> 29:09.581
- Hey...

29:11.483 --> 29:14.320
we got
into Katie's file.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.125
- And?

29:19.158 --> 29:21.093
- Well, there's census
information from the bloc

29:21.127 --> 29:23.029
from the day of arrival
until now.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.131
- Every month they're sending
more and more people

29:25.164 --> 29:26.365
to labor camps
or the factories.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.101
So we plotted
the population numbers.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.570
They follow a perfect
distribution curve.

29:31.603 --> 29:35.141
- Like something you'd draw up
in a calculus lesson.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.243
- What's this?

29:37.276 --> 29:42.048
- If the Y axis represents
LA's human population,

29:42.081 --> 29:45.217
then this is the point

29:45.251 --> 29:48.120
where there are
no more people.

[dramatic music]

*

29:56.128 --> 29:57.930
- To review...

29:57.964 --> 30:00.867
we successfully captured
a key Red Hand operative,

30:00.900 --> 30:04.303
yet before we could extract
any useful intelligence,

30:04.336 --> 30:07.606
she managed to kill herself
while in our custody.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.842
Is that about right?

30:09.876 --> 30:12.845
- The suspect is dead
because he broke protocol,

30:12.879 --> 30:14.380
and now we have
no one else to question.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.848
- Yeah, because you
shot them all.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.316
- Just stop.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.351
You're supposed to be good
at finding people,

30:19.385 --> 30:21.487
and you're supposed to be good
at digging out the truth.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.290
Yet as partners, you have been
an unmitigated disaster.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.992
- I would welcome
the opportunity

30:26.025 --> 30:27.826
to work with
someone else, sir.

30:29.195 --> 30:34.033
- Either fix this
and bring me something...

30:34.066 --> 30:36.068
or I'll have your jobs.

30:39.171 --> 30:43.475
- Group E report the break room
for your ten minutes.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.913
Group E report the break room
for your ten minutes,

30:46.946 --> 30:48.547

30:51.383 --> 30:54.486

She's dead anyway.

- Lindsey, you're back.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.445
- Yes, and I'm afraid I need
a moment of your time.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.180
I was trying to give Gracie
her lesson,

34:08.214 --> 34:10.616
and Charlie was bouncing
his ball against the house

34:10.649 --> 34:12.351
and refused to stop.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.486
I'm sure you understand
that The Greatest Day

34:14.520 --> 34:16.188
expects its Navigators
to be treated

34:16.222 --> 34:18.624
with a certain level
of respect.

34:18.657 --> 34:22.228
I'd hate to have to report
these subversive acts.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.150
- Come on,
I want to show you something.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.323
I almost finished this before
they sent me back to work,

34:51.357 --> 34:52.758
and I forgot about it.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.527
- What is that?
- It's called a makiwara.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.762
It's Japanese.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.197
Martial artists used it

34:58.230 --> 35:00.132
to practice their striking.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.300
Here, set it in there.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.738
It's pretty simple--it's just a
board with a pad of rice straw.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.141
The pad works
on your knuckles.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.910
Build up calluses,
so every punch

35:11.943 --> 35:14.680
makes you a little stronger.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.482
Give it a try.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.653
Remember, a good punch
comes from your hip,

35:21.687 --> 35:23.289

He should be back
inside of six months.

this alone.

the shipment out on time.

a bomb on that ship.

We needed someone
to detonate it during launch.
