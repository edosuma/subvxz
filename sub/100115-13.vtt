WEBVTT

00:01.285 --> 00:03.877
The week started like any other.

00:03.880 --> 00:06.375
Who would've guessed
where I'd be by the end?

00:08.000 --> 00:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.942 --> 00:42.992
Thank you for watching the center

00:42.994 --> 00:44.252
during the day, Ms. Moore.

00:44.254 --> 00:46.153
Promise it's only temporary.

00:46.155 --> 00:49.424
Hell, after you helped get my
baby Munroe into Notre Dame,

00:49.426 --> 00:50.870
it's the least I can do.

00:50.873 --> 00:52.147
I'll be back after school

00:52.150 --> 00:53.795
once I've checked in
on Andrews Construction.

00:53.797 --> 00:55.046
A young man like you,

00:55.049 --> 00:57.407
you must have colleges
knocking down your door.

01:01.012 --> 01:03.629
How can I help you, Mr. Andrews?

01:03.631 --> 01:05.254
Mr. Honey, I know it's late in the game,

01:05.257 --> 01:08.443
but is there any way I
can still apply to college?

01:08.445 --> 01:12.262
The application period
closed months ago.

01:12.264 --> 01:17.535
And moreover, based on your
grades from the past two years,

01:17.537 --> 01:19.203
I have serious doubts
about whether or not

01:19.205 --> 01:21.528
you'll be able to
graduate with your class.

01:24.160 --> 01:28.028
Well, can I at least walk with my
friends at the graduation ceremony?

01:28.030 --> 01:30.465
I find the notion of
an underserving student

01:30.467 --> 01:32.658
being allowed to walk with his peers

01:32.660 --> 01:34.785
without fulfilling
the basic requirements

01:34.787 --> 01:37.579
to graduate quite absurd.

01:37.581 --> 01:42.143
It is dishonest, and
it is a hollow gesture.

01:43.313 --> 01:45.140
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Andrews?

01:56.372 --> 01:57.825
- Damn it!
- Oh, Daddy, let me get that for you.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.568
I got it.

01:59.570 --> 02:00.787
I don't need your help.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.498
No, of course not,

02:03.501 --> 02:05.814
which is why I'll never
offer it to you again.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.542
What's up, Ronnie?

02:36.461 --> 02:37.859
Good morning to you, too.

02:37.862 --> 02:39.850
Less talking, more touching, Andrews.

03:09.065 --> 03:11.330
Thanks for the early
morning delight, lover.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.060
I'm not complaining,
but what's the occasion?

03:15.062 --> 03:17.554
As much as I loved visiting NYC,

03:17.556 --> 03:21.934
it remined me of how little time

03:21.936 --> 03:23.894
we have left together.

03:23.897 --> 03:25.521
I mean, we haven't really talked about

03:25.523 --> 03:27.682
what we're doing after graduation.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.311
What are you saying, Ronnie?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.800
I'm saying...

03:32.803 --> 03:34.404
I don't really wanna think about

03:34.406 --> 03:36.832
the future right now, Archie.

03:36.834 --> 03:42.263
I just want to enjoy these last few
months at Riverdale High with you,

03:42.265 --> 03:43.881
and I wanna have fun.

03:43.883 --> 03:46.767
Can we do that, Archie?
Can we just have fun?

03:46.769 --> 03:48.411
That's music to my ears.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.484
You rang?

03:56.428 --> 03:59.071
I won't mince words with you, Forsythe.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.796
You're out of Quill and Skull.

04:01.934 --> 04:03.192
Why?

04:03.194 --> 04:05.978
Because Betty broke in
to the sanctum sanctorum?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.788
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.615
That's a violation of our code.

04:13.136 --> 04:15.225
That's not all, I'm afraid.

04:18.742 --> 04:21.785
We're also terminating your
Baxter Brothers contract

04:21.786 --> 04:27.248
for failure to deliver
satisfactory material by March 15th.

04:27.251 --> 04:30.627
This Friday, as in the Ides of March?

04:30.629 --> 04:33.389
Well, it's only Monday.
I still have time.

04:33.391 --> 04:36.466
Your rejected novel
took you months to write.

04:36.468 --> 04:40.137
What makes you think you could write
an entirely new one in five days?

04:40.139 --> 04:41.684
Watch me.

04:41.687 --> 04:43.566
Hello?

04:43.568 --> 04:45.517
I'm in serious need of
my real life Tracy True.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.403
How quickly can you
get to Stonewall Prep?

04:47.405 --> 04:49.301
I have to write the best
damn Baxter Brothers novel

04:49.303 --> 04:51.648
these Stonies have ever read by Friday,

04:51.650 --> 04:54.835
which coincidentally
is the Ides of March.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.154
You know, Stonewall Prep
celebrates the holiday

04:57.156 --> 04:59.090
by throwing a big blowout in the woods.

04:59.092 --> 05:02.407
Okay. Well, then...

05:02.410 --> 05:04.163
Why don't you write about what's been

05:04.166 --> 05:06.166
happening to you here at Stonewall?

05:06.169 --> 05:08.349
Like a roman-a-clef, let's say.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.949
Yeah. Like a prep school thriller.

05:10.952 --> 05:12.836
- Sure.
- We could start with my...

05:12.838 --> 05:15.097
- We could start with Moose's arrival.
- Exactly.

05:15.099 --> 05:16.781
You're brilliant, you know that?

05:29.229 --> 05:31.409
I like what you've done
with the place, Archie.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.376
Mr. Lodge.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.902
What's up?

05:36.904 --> 05:39.332
I'm here to work out, train.

05:39.335 --> 05:41.657
Don't you have a really
nice gym at the Pembrooke?

05:41.659 --> 05:42.973
And don't you belong to Solstice?

05:42.975 --> 05:45.163
Yeah, but I'm looking for a real gym.

05:45.166 --> 05:46.387
Like here.

05:51.877 --> 05:54.136
I've gotten away from myself, Archie.

05:54.138 --> 05:57.139
I spend too much time
in suits, behind desks,

05:57.141 --> 05:58.867
but no more.

05:58.870 --> 06:00.728
No more weakness.

06:00.731 --> 06:03.063
Okay, Mr. Lodge. Sure.

06:03.066 --> 06:06.115
You can make your check out to
Frank Andrews Community Center.

06:07.511 --> 06:09.801
"The boys themselves
couldn't see it yet,

06:09.804 --> 06:12.562
but it was a suspicious
coincidence to say the least.

06:12.564 --> 06:15.324
Two new scholarship students
arrived at Brickbridge Prep

06:15.326 --> 06:18.402
after being recruited by the
same teacher, Mr. Shephard.

06:18.404 --> 06:21.238
The old acquaintances
settled into their new lives,

06:21.240 --> 06:23.824
unaware that one or both of them

06:23.826 --> 06:26.594
were destined to be a sacrificial lamb.

06:26.596 --> 06:29.732
The perfect victim to
the perfect murder."

06:32.918 --> 06:35.961
That's where the chapter ends.

06:35.963 --> 06:42.543
Mr. Jones, ten pages of
autobiographical hokum won't save you.

06:42.546 --> 06:43.970
Well, just you wait.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.331
I'll have more tomorrow.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.037
Ellie's Essential Oils.
Don't hate, alleviate.

07:02.039 --> 07:03.506
How can I help you?

07:05.209 --> 07:06.467
And who is she?

07:08.454 --> 07:09.887
Don't worry. We'll vet her.

07:10.853 --> 07:12.253
What was that, babe?

07:12.256 --> 07:14.216
Apparently, there's a high
roller out in La Bonne Nuit

07:14.218 --> 07:15.667
who's caught wind of the Maple Club,

07:15.669 --> 07:18.378
and wields a blank check
with our name on it.

07:18.380 --> 07:21.715
I hate to ask, T.T., but will you
scrutinize this enigmatic patron?

07:21.717 --> 07:23.058
- Sure.
- Great.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.176
You'll find a frosty-haired woman

07:24.178 --> 07:25.343
sitting at the bar later tonight.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.487
I'm on it.

07:26.489 --> 07:29.166
And I'll be sure to lay on the charm.

07:29.169 --> 07:30.819
- Love you.
- Love you.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.741
I'm Antoinette.

07:38.743 --> 07:42.652
I understand you've been asking
about our other establishment.

07:42.654 --> 07:45.172
Why, yes. I'm Rosa Jevon.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.842
I consider myself a connoisseur of rum,

07:47.844 --> 07:51.411
and I've heard rumblings
of a secret rum bar

07:51.413 --> 07:54.664
with ties to this establishment.

07:54.666 --> 07:58.191
Needless to say, I'm intrigued.

07:59.856 --> 08:01.855
Tell you what,

08:01.858 --> 08:05.359
since I like your vibe so much,

08:05.361 --> 08:07.928
I'll talk to my partner about it.

08:07.930 --> 08:09.864
She'll want to meet you, too.

08:09.874 --> 08:13.276
Maybe tomorrow night right here?

08:15.229 --> 08:16.577
It's a date.

08:35.571 --> 08:36.964
Two Cokes, please.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.091
Okay, I needed that.

08:38.092 --> 08:40.043
We're just getting started, Archiekins.

08:41.712 --> 08:45.098
Ronnie, I have to be at the
site by 5:00 tomorrow morning.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.716
Boo!

08:46.718 --> 08:49.504
I thought you said we
were gonna have fun.

08:49.507 --> 08:52.081
Good night, Veronica.
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.983
Fine.

08:55.986 --> 08:58.746
"It was All Hallow's
Eve at Brickbridge Prep.

08:58.748 --> 09:01.231
Jarhead was burning the
midnight oil studying,

09:01.233 --> 09:03.733
when, suddenly, his vision narrowed.

09:03.735 --> 09:07.496
He crumpled to the ground and
awoke to a real life nightmare.

09:07.498 --> 09:10.049
He was locked in a solid oak coffin.

09:10.051 --> 09:13.410
My classmates drugged
me, he realized groggily.

09:13.412 --> 09:14.619
But why?

09:14.621 --> 09:17.431
The truth was sinisterly simple.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.229
It was so he wouldn't be a
witness to the perfect murder.

09:23.514 --> 09:27.349
For, you see, the seminar students

09:27.351 --> 09:30.110
were plotting to kill his roommate Byson

09:30.112 --> 09:32.446
on that very devil's night."

09:37.862 --> 09:39.245
Admit it.

09:41.123 --> 09:44.135
You guys are on the edge
of your seats, aren't you?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.467
Can I ask you something, Mr. Lodge?

09:54.470 --> 09:56.545
It's actually a business question.

09:56.547 --> 09:59.306
Really? Interesting.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.637
Shoot.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.812
I'm not as good as your
daughter, Mr. Lodge.

10:04.814 --> 10:07.147
I can't run multiple businesses,

10:07.149 --> 10:08.482
and do well in school,

10:08.484 --> 10:11.226
and everything else
Veronica's so good at.

10:11.228 --> 10:14.220
If you're talking about this
place and Andrews Construction,

10:14.222 --> 10:15.990
have you thought about shutting one?

10:15.992 --> 10:17.791
Yeah.

10:17.794 --> 10:20.352
My grandpa Artie founded
Andrews Construction

10:20.354 --> 10:22.145
and passed it down to my dad.

10:22.147 --> 10:23.980
It's my legacy.

10:23.982 --> 10:27.835
Well, both your businesses
bear your father's name.

10:27.837 --> 10:30.644
You'll be keeping his
legacy alive no matter what.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.560
Thanks for meeting with me, Mr. Keller.

10:35.563 --> 10:37.177
Yeah, of course, Archie.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.001
So... So, what's been going on?

10:39.004 --> 10:40.670
Truthfully, a lot.

10:40.673 --> 10:43.091
I've been thinking about the
future of Andrews Construction

10:43.093 --> 10:45.585
and the community center recently.

10:45.587 --> 10:48.505
Vic has offered to buy Andrews
Construction a few times.

10:48.507 --> 10:50.370
I don't like the guy personally,

10:50.373 --> 10:51.549
but my dad did.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.252
And if I sold it, I could use that money

10:53.254 --> 10:56.530
to pay you a proper salary to
help me run the center full-time,

10:56.532 --> 10:59.033
if that's something
you'd be interested in.

10:59.035 --> 11:01.393
Well, I've been hopping from job to job

11:01.395 --> 11:03.946
since I lost my post as sheriff.

11:03.948 --> 11:07.151
A more permanent gig would
be a nice change of pace.

11:07.154 --> 11:08.669
I'd like that, Arch.

11:12.823 --> 11:15.341
Does anyone know why DuPont summoned us?

11:15.344 --> 11:17.534
No need to wonder, Ms. Berkeley,

11:17.536 --> 11:19.053
I will tell you.

11:21.057 --> 11:22.965
The headmaster has just given me

11:22.967 --> 11:25.717
some very unsettling news.

11:25.719 --> 11:29.587
One of you has been accused of the
worst crime a writer can commit,

11:29.589 --> 11:31.106
plagiarism.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.643
Mr. Jones, it seems that the short story

11:35.646 --> 11:39.806
that qualified you for
Yale, "On Featherless Wings,"

11:39.808 --> 11:44.545
was, in fact, written by
another student in this seminar.

11:44.548 --> 11:46.363
Oh, and let me guess who accused me.

11:46.365 --> 11:49.449
- Was it Bret?
- No, it was me.

11:49.452 --> 11:51.009
What? Why?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.928
Because I wrote "On Featherless Wings."

11:52.931 --> 11:54.922
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did!

11:54.924 --> 11:57.666
And I've got a timestamp on my computer

11:57.669 --> 12:00.211
proving that I wrote it two months ago.

12:00.214 --> 12:02.455
No, I wrote it during the
summer. It's on my computer.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.006
The story you wrote last summer

12:04.008 --> 12:06.499
is on the laptop I gave
you three weeks ago?

12:06.501 --> 12:07.935
No, it's on my old one.

12:07.937 --> 12:09.356
It's in my room. Can I get it, please?

12:09.358 --> 12:11.663
Go and get it. We shall wait.

12:18.313 --> 12:19.602
What the hell?

12:29.023 --> 12:32.337
Jones, where's this
magical exonerating laptop?

12:32.340 --> 12:34.298
It's not in there
because someone stole it.

12:34.301 --> 12:36.338
That seems rather convenient.

12:36.341 --> 12:39.999
Mr. DuPont, I'm going to fight
these accusations tooth and nail.

12:40.002 --> 12:42.302
You had better.

12:42.304 --> 12:47.049
Stonewall Prep takes the crime
of plagiarism very seriously.

12:47.051 --> 12:49.470
As such, you will go
before the headmaster

12:49.473 --> 12:52.041
and the disciplinary
committee on Friday.

12:53.704 --> 12:57.205
On the Ides of March, fittingly enough.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.140
Mr. DuPont is turning out to be worse

13:04.142 --> 13:07.536
than any of the villains in his
precious Baxter Brothers series.

13:07.538 --> 13:09.196
It's clear he wants me expelled.

13:09.198 --> 13:10.605
Can't let your name be tarnished

13:10.607 --> 13:13.241
by these, these trust fund brats.

13:13.243 --> 13:16.745
Hell, it's my name.
It's our family name.

13:16.747 --> 13:20.441
If I let my reputation be
destroyed by a baseless accusation,

13:20.444 --> 13:23.907
my career as a writer is going
to be over before it even begins.

13:23.910 --> 13:26.096
There's no way that's happening, Jug.

13:28.684 --> 13:31.185
I think I have an idea.

13:31.187 --> 13:33.253
That test was brutal.

13:33.255 --> 13:36.589
Why does anybody need to
know what "primogenitor" is?

13:36.591 --> 13:38.288
Wait. That was one of the questions?

13:39.344 --> 13:41.219
Ms. Lodge.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.865
During a routine search, I found
this flask of rum in your locker.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.110
Excuse me?

13:46.113 --> 13:47.843
Since when did Riverdale High become a

13:47.846 --> 13:50.727
fascist police state,
Principal Mussolini?

13:50.730 --> 13:54.727
It is my responsibility to look
after my students' well-being.

13:56.278 --> 13:57.711
How do you think Barnard will react

13:57.713 --> 14:00.238
when they hear about this incident?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.550
The recruiter already saw
me drinking at my speakeasy.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.324
They're not a bunch of
prissy, power-tripping asshats.

14:06.327 --> 14:07.721
Veronica, stop.

14:07.723 --> 14:10.234
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to protect me.

14:13.962 --> 14:15.354
Principal Honey, I'm so sorry.

14:15.356 --> 14:16.580
The lock on my locker broke,

14:16.582 --> 14:19.591
and I know Veronica's combination, so...

14:19.593 --> 14:23.654
I stashed that flask, my
flask, in there before the test.

14:26.692 --> 14:28.859
So, this is your liquor, Mr. Andrews?

14:28.862 --> 14:30.886
It's been a rough
year, sir, as you know.

14:30.889 --> 14:32.615
Sometimes I just need
to take the edge off.

14:34.065 --> 14:35.124
Archie.

14:37.161 --> 14:38.813
You'll have a week's detention.

14:40.023 --> 14:41.919
And I'm gonna call
your mother about this.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.097
I understand, sir.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.149
Yeah.

15:08.192 --> 15:09.724
Jones.

15:09.726 --> 15:12.769
And Betty. To what do
we owe the pleasure?

15:12.771 --> 15:15.992
We know Jonathan's lying about
writing "On Featherless Wings."

15:15.995 --> 15:19.258
And we know that one or
all of you stole my laptop

15:19.261 --> 15:20.961
and are conspiring against me,

15:20.963 --> 15:22.129
so we're here to prove it.

15:22.131 --> 15:24.047
With a... With a lie detector test?

15:25.951 --> 15:29.970
Okay. Well, I refuse to
participate in this charade.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.047
Fine.

15:32.049 --> 15:34.967
Then you all can watch
while Jughead takes the test.

15:38.314 --> 15:41.056
Is your name Forsythe
Pendleton Jones III?

15:41.058 --> 15:43.308
Yes.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.635
When did you start writing
"On Featherless Wings"?

15:45.637 --> 15:47.303
At the end of last summer,

15:47.305 --> 15:49.204
before I'd even heard of Stonewall Prep.

15:49.207 --> 15:50.741
And did you get rid of your old laptop

15:50.744 --> 15:53.086
because you knew it contained
incriminating evidence?

15:53.089 --> 15:55.728
Of course not. It was stolen.

15:55.730 --> 15:59.816
And what exactly do you
think this is proving?

15:59.818 --> 16:04.152
Well, Jonathan's guilt
by process of elimination.

16:04.155 --> 16:06.623
I hate to break it to you, sweetie,

16:06.626 --> 16:09.805
but this isn't gonna
prove Jughead's innocence.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.983
Do you think I don't know that, bitch?

16:14.864 --> 16:19.018
This lie detector test
is only the beginning.

16:19.021 --> 16:23.281
Once we're done with all
of you one percenters,

16:23.284 --> 16:25.493
none of you will be left standing.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.541
- Hey, handsome.
- What are you doing here?

16:36.544 --> 16:38.878
I just wanted to say thanks

16:38.881 --> 16:40.707
for your gallant gesture earlier.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.709
I was happy to do it.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.414
I got nothing to lose, but
you do. You have everything.

16:50.811 --> 16:52.367
Ronnie.

16:54.167 --> 16:55.383
Ronnie, stop.

16:55.386 --> 16:57.132
Come on, Dr. Beaker
could be back any minute.

16:59.303 --> 17:01.925
- What's going on with you?
- What do you mean?

17:01.928 --> 17:04.679
This isn't you. What's happening?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.145
Nothing.

17:10.146 --> 17:11.479
We made a vow that we would make

17:11.481 --> 17:12.981
the most of our time together,

17:12.983 --> 17:16.970
and now, clearly, you're
backing out of that deal, so...

17:16.973 --> 17:18.644
It's fine. If you don't wanna have fun,

17:18.646 --> 17:20.563
then I'll just go have fun by myself.

17:20.565 --> 17:23.645
- Ronnie...
- I have to meet Cheryl and Toni anyway.

17:32.744 --> 17:33.819
You came.

17:33.821 --> 17:36.788
Well, when a beautiful vixen calls,

17:36.790 --> 17:39.582
I have no choice but to answer.

17:39.584 --> 17:41.584
Did you talk to your partner?

17:41.586 --> 17:43.745
- She's on her way.
- Mmm.

17:43.748 --> 17:46.922
Ugh. I love this song.

17:46.925 --> 17:51.094
I know exactly what we
can do while we wait.

Babe, this is the woman I
was telling you about, Rosa.

18:55.201 --> 18:59.212
Rosa. Has anyone ever told you
how beguiling your eyes are?

18:59.214 --> 19:01.164
I get that a lot.

19:05.098 --> 19:08.233
How about we get out of here?

19:10.099 --> 19:13.758
We have somewhere special
we'd like to bring you.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.477
Excuse me, Ms. Lodge.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

19:16.480 --> 19:19.056
but I have a message from Ms. Blossom.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.201
It's fine. Just polishing
off my mint mojito.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.327
Thank you.

19:24.731 --> 19:29.399
All right, Laura, prepare the suite.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.295
It's time to snap a trap.

19:34.624 --> 19:36.049
I'll get the lights.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.390
Hmm.

19:41.372 --> 19:43.056
Hermosa.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.830
Veronica, what are you doing here?

19:50.381 --> 19:54.901
It's an emboscada, my
darling half-sister.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.478
An ambush.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.738
And they say journalism is a dying art.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.487
I marked you as soon as I soon
as I saw you at La Bonne Nuit.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.477
How dare you try and seduce my dear T.T.

20:04.479 --> 20:06.342
like she's some backwater fool?

20:07.398 --> 20:09.416
As if Cheryl and Toni
would just expose you

20:09.418 --> 20:11.826
to the Maple Club, our rum operation?

20:11.828 --> 20:14.904
I have no idea what you're
talking about, hermana.

20:14.906 --> 20:17.757
The gall you have coming into town,

20:17.759 --> 20:21.428
trying to ruin our
business, my livelihood.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.625
I bet Daddy put you
up to this, didn't he?

20:27.628 --> 20:30.771
Do a little recon, scope
out the competition.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.869
Well, I don't know what he's
told you about his condition...

20:34.872 --> 20:36.013
Everything.

20:38.211 --> 20:40.462
He also told me you didn't know.

20:44.453 --> 20:45.702
He told you...

20:47.956 --> 20:49.231
and not me?

20:51.651 --> 20:56.037
He trusted you... and not me?

20:56.039 --> 20:57.659
Can you blame him?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.223
All right, let's hurry up.

21:13.226 --> 21:14.630
Donna and Joan are in film studies,

21:14.632 --> 21:16.243
but they could be back any moment.

21:22.491 --> 21:25.325
I never should have taken
the laptop from Bret.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.661
We'll get it back, Jug.

21:27.663 --> 21:29.755
You take Joan's side, I'll take Donna's.

22:12.023 --> 22:13.401
"Ready for print."

22:20.624 --> 22:23.052
The Boy In The River?

22:24.506 --> 22:26.294
This is the novel that I submitted

22:26.296 --> 22:28.412
to win the Baxter Brothers contract.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.223
- About Jason Blossom?
- Yeah.

22:30.225 --> 22:33.560
DuPont told me that the
Baxter Brotherhood rejected it

22:33.562 --> 22:36.579
because it wasn't dark
or sociopathic enough.

22:41.911 --> 22:43.553
It's definitely been re-written.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.249
But this is my book.

22:49.578 --> 22:52.567
- What do you want to do?
- The only thing we can do.

22:53.736 --> 22:55.305
I thought the Brotherhood didn't want

22:55.308 --> 22:56.749
my Boy In The River novel.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.734
We didn't, and we don't.

22:58.736 --> 22:59.898
Then what the hell is this?

22:59.901 --> 23:01.994
You really think I wouldn't
recognize my own story

23:01.997 --> 23:03.738
after someone did a polish on it?

23:03.741 --> 23:05.333
Oh, you really should
have had a lawyer take

23:05.335 --> 23:07.785
a much closer look at
your contract, Mr. Jones.

23:07.787 --> 23:11.414
You see, the Brotherhood
owns everything you submit.

23:11.416 --> 23:13.249
We kept the elements we liked,

23:13.251 --> 23:16.127
and then, let another ghost
writer try their hand at it.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.614
Oh, yeah? Who?

23:18.617 --> 23:24.671
Well, actually, all of your
classmates collaborated on it.

23:32.237 --> 23:34.603
Archie, what are you doing here?

23:34.605 --> 23:35.955
I came to make sure you're okay.

23:37.108 --> 23:38.772
I'm worried about you, Veronica.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.780
What are you doing? Drinking at school,

23:45.783 --> 23:48.390
acting like this crazy party girl?

23:48.393 --> 23:50.220
You're pushing people away, Veronica.

23:50.222 --> 23:51.805
Tell me what's really going on.

23:57.335 --> 23:59.294
He's dying, Archie.

23:59.297 --> 24:02.548
- Who is?
- My dad.

24:02.550 --> 24:05.217
He's been diagnosed with
a debilitating disease,

24:05.219 --> 24:08.321
and I don't know what to do.

24:08.323 --> 24:11.726
I feel... completely lost.

24:16.665 --> 24:18.373
I'm sorry, Veronica.

24:23.203 --> 24:25.512
I know there's not much that I can say,

24:29.583 --> 24:32.181
but one of the worst
parts about my dad dying

24:33.831 --> 24:35.850
was that I was never
able to say goodbye.

24:36.807 --> 24:39.204
Even in the months before,

24:39.207 --> 24:41.504
I didn't know what
little time we had left.

24:41.506 --> 24:44.190
And I regret not spending
more of it with him.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.361
I don't know if I can sit by

24:48.363 --> 24:50.929
and watch him waste away to nothing.

24:50.932 --> 24:53.608
I don't wanna see that.

24:53.610 --> 24:56.202
Veronica, you're the
strongest person that I know.

24:56.204 --> 24:59.873
And right now, you have to give
some of that strength to your dad.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.734
You know better than anyone
how to get him fired up.

25:03.861 --> 25:05.270
That's what he needs.

25:20.228 --> 25:23.796
Happy Friday, you soul-sucking vampires.

25:23.798 --> 25:25.589
Good morning to you, too, mija.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.234
Now, before you crawl back
into your coffins for the day,

25:28.236 --> 25:30.895
I've got a little presentation
I've been working on.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.323
Red Raven's newest ad campaign.

25:37.412 --> 25:40.822
Consumers are now more interested
in quality than name brands,

25:40.824 --> 25:43.583
which is why we conducted
a blind taste test

25:43.585 --> 25:47.086
in which nine out of ten test subjects

25:47.088 --> 25:49.720
picked Red Raven rum
over the competitors,

25:49.723 --> 25:51.782
Lodge Rum and Lodge Spiced Rum.

25:51.784 --> 25:55.762
As we like to say at Red
Raven, quality always.

25:55.764 --> 25:57.430
And this is only the first wave.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.864
We'll be running print ads
in the Riverdale Register,

25:59.867 --> 26:01.458
The Greendale Gazette

26:01.460 --> 26:04.062
and the <i>Seaside
Sentinel</i> to start.

26:04.064 --> 26:10.593
Mija, do you really think you'll
get the upper hand over me?

26:10.595 --> 26:13.554
You're a little specialty brand.

26:13.556 --> 26:15.472
Oh, haven't you heard?

26:15.474 --> 26:16.974
Cheryl's already begun renovations

26:16.976 --> 26:19.476
on her family's maple factory.

26:19.478 --> 26:23.359
We'll be producing 300% more
maple rum by the end of the year.

26:25.912 --> 26:30.366
Well, then I only have
one thing left to say.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.687
- Congratulations, mija.
- Hmm.

26:36.849 --> 26:41.711
You have successfully awoken the dragon.

26:44.304 --> 26:45.979
Prepare to be eaten.

26:50.841 --> 26:54.477
What is wrong with you? Why would
you intentionally provoke him?

26:54.480 --> 26:55.833
You know how ill he is.

26:55.836 --> 26:58.862
In times like these, family members
should be supporting each other,

26:58.865 --> 27:00.722
not antagonizing one another.

27:00.725 --> 27:03.663
Seems to me that Daddy
is doing just fine.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.648
Just one minor ad campaign,

27:05.650 --> 27:08.167
and he's more fired up
than he's been in days.

27:08.169 --> 27:12.204
So, don't for a second think you
understand Daddy better than me.

27:12.206 --> 27:15.374
If anybody is going to save
Daddy from this crippling disease,

27:15.376 --> 27:19.769
it's going to be me, Veronica Lodge.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.790
Now, stand back and watch, ladies.

27:21.793 --> 27:23.303
You might learn something.

27:27.355 --> 27:30.023
I've been thinking about
Mr. Chipping's tie pin, Jug,

27:30.025 --> 27:31.350
and how Donna had it.

27:31.353 --> 27:33.522
It doesn't add up.

27:33.525 --> 27:34.992
If the affair with Chipping was just

27:34.995 --> 27:36.871
another one of Donna's
fabricated stories,

27:36.874 --> 27:38.589
then how did she get it?

27:38.591 --> 27:42.610
Let's assume that someone else
took Mr. Chipping's tie pin.

27:42.612 --> 27:44.627
Someone like Mr. DuPont?

27:44.630 --> 27:45.996
Exactly.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.564
It's possible he gave it to Donna

27:47.566 --> 27:52.679
to add credibility to her story
about them having an affair.

27:52.682 --> 27:54.526
And then, she would have the tie pin

27:54.529 --> 27:56.215
and the story of the affair at the ready

27:56.217 --> 27:58.428
in case anyone got
too close to the truth.

28:00.036 --> 28:02.899
That Mr. Chipping was driven
to suicide by Mr. DuPont.

28:05.056 --> 28:06.903
It's a theory, at any rate.

28:08.750 --> 28:11.363
I wanted to clear the
air between us, Donna.

28:13.401 --> 28:16.593
And hopefully resolve this
whole Jughead witch hunt thing,

28:16.595 --> 28:18.791
just the two of us.

28:21.985 --> 28:26.770
See, I think that you and
Bret, Joan and Jonathan

28:26.772 --> 28:29.351
are just pawns

28:29.354 --> 28:31.459
being manipulated by Mr. DuPont,

28:31.461 --> 28:34.111
who, I think, is the real villain here.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.034
I'm intrigued. Go on.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.504
I don't think you had
an affair with Chipping.

28:42.171 --> 28:45.956
If I'm right, and you didn't,

28:45.958 --> 28:49.712
and DuPont somehow put you
up to saying that you did,

28:50.847 --> 28:55.942
I implore you, come forward.

28:55.944 --> 29:00.606
Don't let yourself be a victim
of his machinations, Donna.

29:04.452 --> 29:07.311
You think you're close
to the truth, don't you?

29:07.313 --> 29:09.956
You and Jughead, teen detectives.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.484
Are we?

29:13.486 --> 29:15.003
I guess we'll see.

29:24.121 --> 29:25.972
Still working on that book, huh?

29:25.974 --> 29:28.791
Hmm. Well.

29:28.793 --> 29:33.220
I do hope you enjoy your
last night in this room.

29:33.222 --> 29:36.315
You are so smug it just hurts, Bret.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.342
You know, you don't know what
I'm going to say at the tribunal,

29:38.344 --> 29:41.487
but I promise you it's not just
going to be about some short story

29:41.489 --> 29:43.565
I didn't plagiarize, Bret.

29:43.568 --> 29:47.017
It's going to be about
everything that is going on here.

29:47.019 --> 29:51.238
It's going to be about Chipping,
and Moose, and Quill and Skull,

29:51.240 --> 29:52.486
and about my novel.

29:52.489 --> 29:57.002
I'm going to let all these toxic
little genies out of their bottles.

29:57.005 --> 29:58.880
Do you understand me?

29:58.882 --> 30:01.805
No, you're not gonna say a damn thing.

30:02.743 --> 30:04.660
Do you know how I know?

30:04.662 --> 30:06.179
'Cause as it turns out,

30:06.181 --> 30:09.107
I do have a tape of you and
Ponytail doing the nasty.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.673
And if you so much as
utter a single j'accuse,

30:18.676 --> 30:20.860
I will release it wide.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.264
You think blackmail is gonna stop me?

30:25.266 --> 30:28.493
Yes. Because you're a hopeless romantic.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.894
That tape might not hurt you, Jones,

30:31.897 --> 30:34.040
but it will destroy Betty.

30:34.042 --> 30:36.191
Something like that will haunt her

30:36.193 --> 30:37.877
for the rest of her life.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.787
So, what's it gonna be?

30:39.789 --> 30:43.415
You wanna continue this
sad attempt at martyrdom?

30:43.417 --> 30:45.200
Or are you gonna protect the honor

30:45.202 --> 30:48.554
of your precious girlfriend?

31:13.540 --> 31:14.831
Wait.

31:16.417 --> 31:17.750
Something wrong, Arch?

31:24.116 --> 31:25.687
I can't do it.

31:25.690 --> 31:26.972
What the hell?

31:26.975 --> 31:29.502
Well, Vic, my grandpa
started this company,

31:29.505 --> 31:30.913
and my dad kept it going.

31:30.915 --> 31:32.805
It's not gonna be sold on my watch.

31:38.088 --> 31:39.680
Make no mistake,

31:39.682 --> 31:43.091
the stealing of another student's
work will not be tolerated

31:43.093 --> 31:44.801
at Stonewall Prep.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.980
If the accusation is found to be true,

31:47.982 --> 31:50.616
the penalty is immediate expulsion.

31:50.618 --> 31:53.629
But we're going to
give you a choice today,

31:53.632 --> 31:55.882
one that you do not deserve.

31:55.885 --> 32:01.794
Nevertheless, you can
either gracefully, quietly

32:01.796 --> 32:07.041
withdraw from Stonewall Prep,
which will save yourself and us

32:07.043 --> 32:08.828
the embarrassment of a hearing,

32:08.831 --> 32:12.162
or you can stay and fight
the accusation of plagiarism

32:12.164 --> 32:14.831
in a public forum, where you could win,

32:14.833 --> 32:18.835
but most likely, you'll lose,

32:18.838 --> 32:22.970
tarnishing Stonewall's name
and destroying your future.

32:30.825 --> 32:32.203
I'll leave.

32:45.608 --> 32:47.364
What the hell happened in there, huh?

32:47.366 --> 32:49.175
I thought you were gonna
bring down the temple,

32:49.177 --> 32:51.743
and instead you let them
run roughshod all over you.

32:51.745 --> 32:52.920
What choice did I have?

32:52.922 --> 32:54.329
It's not like you to
walk away from a fight,

32:54.331 --> 32:55.520
a fight you could have won.

32:55.523 --> 32:57.165
You don't know that.

32:57.167 --> 32:59.426
You don't know these people.

32:59.428 --> 33:01.762
This game is fixed. It's
been fixed from the beginning.

33:01.764 --> 33:04.126
There was no way I
was winning that today.

33:17.531 --> 33:19.279
How's it looking, Mr. Lodge?

33:19.282 --> 33:21.565
Like it's always been there.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.215
Vic let you keep the sign, huh?

33:23.218 --> 33:25.458
Uh, I didn't end up selling the company.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.121
I couldn't.

33:27.123 --> 33:28.716
I made Mr. Keller foreman.

33:28.719 --> 33:30.240
He said he'd work on a reduced salary

33:30.242 --> 33:32.501
until we get a few more
contracts coming in.

33:32.503 --> 33:33.552
Good.

33:34.722 --> 33:36.103
Good.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.002
It was the sex tape, wasn't it?

33:42.004 --> 33:44.546
Bret threatened to release
it if you didn't back off.

33:44.548 --> 33:46.235
What does it matter, Betty?

33:46.238 --> 33:49.301
To hell with Bret, to hell
with this entire school.

33:49.303 --> 33:51.261
Couldn't have been all bad, Forsythe.

33:51.263 --> 33:54.890
Yeah, we hope there
aren't any hard feelings.

33:54.892 --> 33:56.742
There's a party tonight in
the woods behind the school.

33:56.744 --> 33:59.227
- We're celebrating the Ides of March.
- You should come.

34:00.337 --> 34:03.082
One last hurrah before you pack up
your things and are gone forever.

34:03.085 --> 34:05.338
- You're deranged.
- We'll be there.

34:05.341 --> 34:07.651
- What?
- One last hurrah.

34:07.654 --> 34:10.255
Great. And bring your friends, too.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.750
The more the merrier.

34:16.286 --> 34:17.953
Like hell we're going to that, Jug.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.551
You trust me, right?

34:19.554 --> 34:22.889
- Of course. Why?
- I have a plan.

34:22.891 --> 34:25.437
But first, I'm going to need
to take care of that leverage

34:25.440 --> 34:28.357
that Bret has over us, and
then I will tell you everything.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.152
It's all gonna be okay, I promise.

34:33.688 --> 34:35.262
Okay.

34:35.264 --> 34:36.696
I love you.

34:37.860 --> 34:38.909
I love you, too.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.850
Penny for your thoughts.

34:58.973 --> 35:01.706
Ronnie, I won't be able to walk
with everyone at graduation.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.808
What?

35:05.053 --> 35:06.862
Mr. Honey told me on Monday.

35:08.507 --> 35:09.851
I have a plan.

35:10.818 --> 35:12.187
Okay.

35:14.322 --> 35:16.263
I'll go to summer school for my diploma,

35:16.265 --> 35:17.564
take a skip year,

35:17.566 --> 35:19.891
and apply to colleges
for a spring semester.

35:19.893 --> 35:21.068
What do you think?

35:21.070 --> 35:23.913
That sounds like an
outstanding plan, Archie.

35:38.087 --> 35:39.870
It's Bee.

35:39.872 --> 35:42.386
She's inviting us to
a Stonewall Prep party.

35:43.893 --> 35:46.685
- You wanna go?
- Seriously?

35:46.687 --> 35:48.253
Those people suck.

35:48.255 --> 35:49.763
Right you are, Archiekins,

35:49.765 --> 35:53.428
but when's the last time all
four of us hung out together?

35:55.196 --> 35:58.572
And we did vow to have more fun.

36:00.886 --> 36:02.354
Okay.

36:32.883 --> 36:34.382
Oh, God.

36:34.384 --> 36:36.068
Looks like A Midsummer Night's Dream

36:36.070 --> 36:37.761
had a baby with Euphoria.

36:37.763 --> 36:40.239
Gotta hand it to these jerks,
they know how to throw a party.

36:40.241 --> 36:41.648
You guys seen Jughead?

36:41.650 --> 36:44.392
I said we'd meet up with
him once we got here.

36:44.394 --> 36:46.728
I'm gonna do a lap, okay?
See if I can find him.

36:46.730 --> 36:48.854
- Here.
- Thanks.

36:48.857 --> 36:51.083
Wanna move closer to the fire?

36:51.085 --> 36:55.237
I have a way more fun idea
of how you could keep me warm.

36:55.239 --> 36:57.711
When's the last time
we made it in the woods?

36:59.576 --> 37:00.876
Let's go.

37:11.296 --> 37:15.834
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your beers.

37:31.125 --> 37:34.249
Oh, thou bleeding piece of earth.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.344
What have we got here?

37:36.347 --> 37:40.798
I knew you and Ponytail were
into, um, some weird kinks,

37:40.801 --> 37:43.377
but, uh...

37:43.379 --> 37:46.143
I mean, what is this, Freaky Friday?

37:50.794 --> 37:52.811
Gentlemen, would you excuse us?

37:52.813 --> 37:56.273
Uh, the bunny and I have
some unfinished business.

38:03.798 --> 38:06.720
You wanna settle this? All right.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.496
But not here.

38:12.316 --> 38:13.457
Follow me.

39:09.239 --> 39:10.506
Donna.

39:14.228 --> 39:16.016
Oh, good, you made it.

39:16.019 --> 39:19.873
Yeah, I know Jughead didn't
speak up at his tribunal

39:19.876 --> 39:21.959
because Bret's blackmailing him.

39:23.387 --> 39:26.930
But I do not care what you do to me.

39:26.932 --> 39:30.223
So, what, you have a
tape of me and Jughead?

39:32.079 --> 39:34.821
I am the daughter of the Black Hood.

39:34.823 --> 39:36.398
And it's gonna take a lot more than that

39:36.400 --> 39:38.584
to get me and Jughead off your case.

39:38.586 --> 39:42.946
I promise you, we are going to find out

39:42.948 --> 39:47.426
and expose all of your dirty secrets,

39:47.428 --> 39:51.721
up to and including Chipping's murder.

39:51.724 --> 39:54.391
Do you have anything to say about that?

39:55.102 --> 39:57.460
Actually, I do.

39:57.462 --> 40:02.274
You see, I've been doing a
little investigating of my own

40:02.276 --> 40:06.353
and I found out some fascinating
things about you, Betty.

40:06.355 --> 40:09.264
I even took a field
trip to Shankshaw Prison

40:09.266 --> 40:14.188
to see your old friend Evelyn Evernever.

40:14.191 --> 40:16.270
And you know what Evelyn told me?

40:16.273 --> 40:17.900
The magic word.

40:19.627 --> 40:22.127
Oh, you mean "tangerine"
repeated three times?

40:22.129 --> 40:24.463
Yeah, no, you're a little
late to that party, Donna.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.315
Tangerine doesn't work on me anymore.

40:26.318 --> 40:29.641
No, she told me the other magic word.

40:30.661 --> 40:33.287
The one that makes you fugue,

40:33.290 --> 40:36.302
and hurt the people who you love.

40:36.305 --> 40:37.685
You wanna hear it?

40:41.617 --> 40:42.731
Okay.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.880
Okay.

40:49.657 --> 40:53.611
Hey, have you guys
seen Betty and Jughead?

40:53.614 --> 40:55.620
I think they went that way,

40:55.623 --> 40:57.998
into the clearing behind those trees.

41:01.227 --> 41:02.481
Thanks.

41:26.012 --> 41:27.846
Oh, my God, Betty, what happened?

41:27.849 --> 41:30.117
Jug? Is he breathing?

41:38.205 --> 41:40.113
Started out like any other week.

41:40.115 --> 41:41.291
There's no pulse.

41:41.302 --> 41:43.294
Who would've guessed
that by Friday night...

41:43.296 --> 41:44.500
He's dead.

41:46.046 --> 41:47.512
What did you do, Betty?
