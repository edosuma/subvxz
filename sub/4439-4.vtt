Oh, yeah?

31:34.393 --> 31:37.135
He stopped what could have
been a full-blown riot.

31:41.191 --> 31:44.228
People were freaking out
and he talked them down.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.563

31:55.122 --> 31:58.114
You ever consider a career
in law enforcement?

32:17.102 --> 32:18.933
Was that you?

32:23.733 --> 32:25.314
Was that me what?

32:26.945 --> 32:30.233
Was that you who saved my life?

32:41.126 --> 32:43.458
I learned about Peter in that cabin.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.007
We're broke.
He emptied our accounts.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.930
And the house is in foreclosure.

32:59.352 --> 33:01.968
So, what were you all into?

33:02.856 --> 33:04.141

33:11.948 --> 33:14.860

I did, um...

33:16.161 --> 33:18.368
I had a bunch Of Odd jobs.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.616

33:24.920 --> 33:26.660
And then, um...

33:28.131 --> 33:30.417
Then I linked up with a bookie

33:31.468 --> 33:33.459
out Of Westlake.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.545
Taking bets?

what they owed.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.102
You're an enforcer.

33:49.277 --> 33:53.111
Guys like Phil owed
and they paid up.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.780
And most Of the time, it's like that.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.983
Peter never gambled.

I’ve got the cash, but my wife's home.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.382
Meet me at the other spot.

34:20.976 --> 34:24.093
It's his voice mail from five days ago.

34:43.373 --> 34:44.954
He must have taken Off.

34:46.876 --> 34:50.994
You know, that happens sometimes.
Some guys, they get in so deep and...

34:52.007 --> 34:54.214
You know, they skip town.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.597
I'm sorry.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.430
You're sorry?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.856
I let you stay in my house.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.441
I trusted you.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.951
Your "sorry" means nothing to me.

you better be gone.

So is the outbreak over?

35:36.926 --> 35:38.791
Well, everyone who's sick
has been treated,

35:39.012 --> 35:42.379
and anyone exposed to meningitis
got antibiotics.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.635
So, yes, it's over.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.558

are outside the dome,

36:12.087 --> 36:14.123
and there's more than enough
room at my house.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.797
It's just me,
so you guys could stay there.

and meet you in the car.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.499
Babe, what are you doing?

36:58.174 --> 37:00.039

Okay, what's going on?
You're not acting like yourself.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.438
