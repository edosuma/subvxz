WEBVTT

00:55.765 --> 00:58.268
<i>When the moon
waxes full again,</i>

00:58.560 --> 01:01.604
<i>we shall seize
our fame and fortune,</i>

01:02.439 --> 01:05.942
and fight such a battle
that the world will tremble.

01:08.069 --> 01:10.363
And the winner
shall inherit the Earth.

01:53.448 --> 01:54.449
Home.

01:55.992 --> 01:57.785
Honestly,
I don't know anymore.

01:59.996 --> 02:01.122
What is home?

02:02.332 --> 02:03.374
I'm a Viking.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.880
But there's something else.

02:10.548 --> 02:11.966
The mother of my children,

02:12.800 --> 02:13.801
Torvi.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.970
I don't love her anymore.

02:16.387 --> 02:17.764
She doesn't deserve it.

02:19.432 --> 02:20.767
I feel bad about it.

02:24.145 --> 02:27.148
Well, what we deserve
and what we get,

02:28.233 --> 02:29.275
Bjorn Ironside,

02:30.818 --> 02:32.278
it's never in balance.

02:33.571 --> 02:38.409
It appears the gods
are not much interested
in fairness.

03:02.809 --> 03:03.851
Ah!

03:11.359 --> 03:12.402
Yah!

03:13.820 --> 03:14.821
Good?

03:33.631 --> 03:35.133
How much further, Floki?

03:36.593 --> 03:38.052
We've been walking for days.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.221
I'm so greatly
looking forward

03:40.305 --> 03:42.515
to seeing the house
that Thorgrim built for Floki.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.225
If it exists.

03:44.642 --> 03:45.768
Oh, it exists.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.395
I saw it in a dream.

03:47.478 --> 03:48.855
It's made of gold.

03:49.772 --> 03:51.524
It is a house
built by the gods.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.611
It should be big enough
for all of us,
not just Floki.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.281
Why won't you
speak to us, Floki?

03:58.823 --> 04:00.742
Because you
wouldn't understand.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.094
Welcome home, my son.

04:23.056 --> 04:24.349
Why are the Sami here?

04:26.267 --> 04:30.271
King Harald
and your brother, Ivar,
are planning to attack us.

04:32.023 --> 04:34.525
When?
At the next full moon.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.820
Well, it seems
I've returned just in time.

04:38.029 --> 04:39.906
We need even more help.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.241
We can't underestimate
the forces

04:42.325 --> 04:44.452
that Harald and Ivar
will bring to battle.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.914
That is why
I invited the Sami to join us.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.376
Come and meet them.

04:55.171 --> 04:57.131
Ubbe.
Welcome.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.097
Princess.

05:55.690 --> 05:56.691
<i>Tell me, Halfdan.</i>

05:57.358 --> 06:00.319
What was the most
amazing thing
you saw on your travels?

06:00.945 --> 06:01.946
Nothing.

06:03.114 --> 06:06.576
Nothing?
They call it "the desert."

06:07.577 --> 06:09.328
It's just miles
and miles of sand.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.956
Sand as far as you can see.

06:12.582 --> 06:14.000
And nothing but sand.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.503
And what was the second
most amazing thing you saw?

06:20.548 --> 06:21.549
Everything.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.387
Ubbe.

06:27.138 --> 06:29.891
Why have you fallen out
so violently with Ivar?

06:29.974 --> 06:31.934
How can you even
ask me that question?

06:32.685 --> 06:34.604
You know what Ivar is.
You saw.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.941
Hvitserk chose to go with him.
The traitor.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.194
He'll destroy
our father's legacy
for all time.

06:41.277 --> 06:44.030
We can fight to preserve
as much as we can.

06:45.031 --> 06:47.241
Our father lives
through us, Bjorn.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.993
Or he doesn't live at all.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.712
What are you
going to do, Halfdan?

07:01.631 --> 07:04.008
Are you going
to rejoin your brother?

07:07.386 --> 07:08.387
No.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.642
Bjorn saved my life.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.812
And I have sworn
allegiance to him.

07:17.522 --> 07:18.564
And nothing

07:19.774 --> 07:21.484
will make me change my mind.

07:22.068 --> 07:25.279
While you were away,
your brother came here.

07:26.197 --> 07:30.576
He swore to me that
he no longer had any designs
on my kingdom,

07:30.868 --> 07:32.036
but he was lying.

07:35.623 --> 07:39.335
How do I know
that you're not lying?

07:42.296 --> 07:43.339
You don't.

07:44.549 --> 07:48.553
Even though I swore
on my sacred ring.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.140
Do you think I'm lying,

07:54.308 --> 07:55.309
Bjorn?

07:56.477 --> 07:58.729
You and I crawled out
from under the same rock.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.983
I believe you'll fight
against your brother.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.078
Guthrum, I brought
something back for you.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.707
It belonged to a man
named Commander Euphemius,

08:19.125 --> 08:20.626
a Byzantine prince.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.217
Thank you, Bjorn.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.720
It's beautiful.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.515
Perhaps, one day,
I will get to meet
this Euphemius.

08:36.601 --> 08:37.602
Alas.

08:38.436 --> 08:39.729
No, you will not.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.816
Halfdan and I ate him.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.945
You ate him?
Well, not on purpose.

08:48.946 --> 08:52.575
No, you have
to understand that
many strange things happen

08:52.658 --> 08:54.118
in that other world.

08:54.619 --> 08:56.662
Perhaps, one day,
you will see for yourself.

09:04.629 --> 09:06.005
Here is the place.

09:08.007 --> 09:09.926
Here is where we shall live.

09:11.302 --> 09:12.553
Here's what?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.181
And the settlement?

09:16.682 --> 09:18.392
I can't even
see a single house.

09:19.685 --> 09:20.770
You must be joking.

09:21.187 --> 09:22.480
You're not looking.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.734
That's been your problem
all the way through, Eyvind.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.445
You don't know how to look.

09:30.488 --> 09:34.825
I can see everything
with my own eyes.

09:35.493 --> 09:37.286
I don't need to be tricked.

09:38.329 --> 09:41.332
What I see is nothing.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.003
Where is the house
the gods have built?

09:46.212 --> 09:47.338
Huh?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.423
It's not here!

09:51.801 --> 09:54.762
I have to cut off
your cursed head
right now, Floki.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.646
You see?

10:04.438 --> 10:08.109
This is the land of Loki
and the giants.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.112
This is the land of evil.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.619
Look at
the hot water spurt.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.830
I'm sure Hel is close by.

10:21.163 --> 10:23.499
Stop this stupid talk.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.377
This is just water
the gods have made hot

10:26.460 --> 10:28.337
for the very purpose
of helping us.

10:28.838 --> 10:31.424
Here, we can wash our clothes,
and even bake bread.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.843
Is there not a soul here

10:33.926 --> 10:36.053
who would not enjoy
a slice of hot bread?

11:18.304 --> 11:19.764
I can see she interests you.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.851
Don't worry.

11:24.435 --> 11:25.728
I'm not jealous.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.063
Not anymore.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.483
When you didn't
come back from England,

11:30.566 --> 11:32.026
I knew the love we had
was over.

11:35.488 --> 11:37.072
I only want to know

11:37.156 --> 11:39.492
that you will always
look after our children.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.660
I swear, Torvi.

11:42.995 --> 11:45.122
I will always take care
of you and the children.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.004
This is for you.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.762
Why don't you give it
to someone else?

12:01.096 --> 12:03.015
Because I want you
to have it.

12:05.351 --> 12:06.352
Thank you.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.104
Sweet Bjorn.

12:31.836 --> 12:32.962
What is it?

12:36.841 --> 12:37.967
I want her.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.470
You don't know anything
about that girl.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.180
Ask the king.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.228
What about Torvi?

12:50.855 --> 12:52.398
It's finished.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.612
Come.

13:11.125 --> 13:16.255
My son would like
to sleep with your daughter.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.113
Torvi?

13:46.577 --> 13:47.578
It's all right.

13:48.579 --> 13:49.622
I understand.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.877
He wasn't my fate after all.

13:58.464 --> 13:59.465
No.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.425
I don't blame Bjorn.

14:03.052 --> 14:04.053
No.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.513
But still.

14:07.473 --> 14:08.724
You have his children.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.394
Children die.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.271
We all die.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.232
We mustn't try to hold on
to things that pass.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.859
You're very wise, aren't you?

14:20.486 --> 14:21.904
No.
Hmm.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.835
I want you to give this
to Margrethe.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.921
No.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.331
You love Torvi?

15:19.837 --> 15:20.838
No.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.841
I felt sorry for her.

15:23.924 --> 15:27.928
If you feel sorry for someone,
you don't have to kiss them.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.141
We don't have time
to play games.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.852
The world is coming
to an end.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.770
Ivar and Harald are coming.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.149
We have to know
what we are fighting for.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.361
We have to know
why we are fighting.

15:44.445 --> 15:45.654
I agree.

15:47.573 --> 15:50.033
Lagertha has been weak.

15:50.743 --> 15:54.079
Do we really want to fight
for someone like that?

15:54.413 --> 15:56.457
She's the rightful ruler
of Kattegat.

15:56.665 --> 16:00.586
No, she killed
the legitimate ruler
of Kattegat.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.382
What are you saying?

16:10.804 --> 16:12.222
Don't fight Ivar.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.224
Why would you?

16:15.184 --> 16:19.021
Let them come.
Let them overthrow her.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.565
Don't stand in their way.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.027
You are the oldest son.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.780
If they kill Bjorn...

16:38.332 --> 16:39.833
If they kill Bjorn,

16:40.626 --> 16:43.670
then you will be
King of Kattegat,

16:44.171 --> 16:46.173
and I will be Queen.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.676
What an amazing outcome
for a slave,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.596
to end up as a queen?

16:54.640 --> 16:55.974
Is that what you want?

16:56.683 --> 16:57.726
Yes, Ubbe.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.645
It's what I want.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.733
It's what I want.

17:14.243 --> 17:17.037
I still miss Ragnar even now.

17:20.499 --> 17:23.043
I often remember
when we were farmers.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.129
You've come a long way
since then.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.214
Perhaps.

17:28.382 --> 17:31.426
One day, I would like
to go back to being a farmer.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.763
Living a simple life,

17:34.847 --> 17:40.185
watching the sun rise
in the morning,
and set in the evening.

17:41.687 --> 17:42.938
You deserve it.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.482
Your life has never been easy,
I know that.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.278
But as your son,
I am so proud of you.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.198
Of what you have achieved.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.999
King Harald kidnapped Astrid
and took her away.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.002
I miss her, too.

18:05.085 --> 18:09.548
My life is full
of ghosts now.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.721
You sound as if you think
it might all be over soon.

18:16.305 --> 18:17.973
But that is not you.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.018
Lagertha doesn't look back.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.104
She faces what is to come.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.106
And I know
you will do that now.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.068
For war is coming.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.446
It will be like Ragnarok.

18:34.406 --> 18:36.825
Ivar will be
like the wolf, Fenrir.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.703
And flames will dance
in his eyes.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.749
And he will try to tear
the sky apart.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
No.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.383
You wouldn't want
to miss that now, would you?

18:53.967 --> 18:55.135
No, it's true.

18:56.470 --> 18:58.388
I wouldn't want to miss that.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.738
You will be fighting
against your brothers.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.114
Yes?

19:16.573 --> 19:17.574
Yes.

19:19.534 --> 19:21.954
Perhaps even
my brother, Bjorn,

19:22.037 --> 19:23.622
if he returns
from his travels.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.750
Do they frighten you,

19:27.960 --> 19:29.002
your brothers?

19:30.837 --> 19:31.838
No.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.883
Maybe Bjorn. Just a little.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.720
I don't find him very smart,
but he is a great warrior.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.557
They call him
"Bjorn Ironside."

19:49.106 --> 19:50.357
And the woman,

19:51.775 --> 19:53.276
the one
who killed your mother?

19:56.196 --> 19:57.906
- Lagertha?
- Hmm.

19:59.658 --> 20:01.159
I've sworn to kill her.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.870
And she knows that I'll do it.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.790
She just doesn't know
how bad it's going to be.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.423
Where will you fight?
I don't know.

20:15.173 --> 20:19.011
Perhaps they'll placate
themselves in Kattegat,
the main town.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.850
That would be foolish.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.986
Maybe you can help me
think of a strategy.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.322
Hmm?

20:39.698 --> 20:41.450
You would
trust me to do that

20:42.284 --> 20:44.161
even though I don't care
which side wins?

20:44.244 --> 20:47.456
Ah, but you want to win.
I see that.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.584
And I want to be around people
who want to win.

20:52.044 --> 20:53.670
What they do afterwards,
who cares?

20:54.171 --> 20:55.172
The fact is,

20:56.048 --> 20:58.592
I will only fight for you
because I am certain,

20:59.342 --> 21:00.761
as certain as I can be,

21:02.137 --> 21:04.681
that God wishes me to do so.

21:06.058 --> 21:10.687
That I am part of some plan
which I cannot comprehend.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.650
Then you believe, like us,
that you are fated, huh?

21:16.443 --> 21:17.444
No.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.280
I still believe
I have free will.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.158
I choose to fight for you.

21:27.788 --> 21:31.750
If you are fated,
it doesn't matter
if you choose or not.

21:32.834 --> 21:36.296
You simply have the illusion
of being free to choose.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.300
I don't know.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.304
Excuse me?

21:48.058 --> 21:50.977
I just don't know if,
when I joined your side,

21:51.978 --> 21:54.439
whether it was fate
or free will.

22:00.237 --> 22:01.696
What does it matter?

22:02.656 --> 22:03.657
Huh?

22:30.308 --> 22:33.228
I was looking for you.
I didn't know where you were.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.149
I don't have to be attended
at all times, do I?

22:37.232 --> 22:39.901
Of course not.
I just like to know
where you are.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.740
You are so precious to me.

22:49.578 --> 22:50.954
I saw you being sick.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.331
Are you ill?

22:55.375 --> 22:56.918
Please tell me you're not ill.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.630
No,
I don't think I'm ill.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.841
Then?

23:04.718 --> 23:06.303
I think I might be
with child.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.892
By all the gods.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.145
My wife is with child.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.397
Yes, it's possible.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.193
You make me so very happy.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.737
Well, I'm glad. I, um...

23:25.322 --> 23:26.531
Don't cry.

23:26.615 --> 23:29.201
Don't cry.
This is astonishing news.

23:29.534 --> 23:30.660
First, I find a woman,

23:30.744 --> 23:34.206
and then she tells me
she's going to have my child.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.333
Oh, don't cry, Astrid.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.001
Astrid.

23:42.756 --> 23:46.593
You have just made me
the happiest man in Midgard.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.237
Why don't you show yourself
to these people

24:05.320 --> 24:06.988
as you show yourself to me?

24:08.782 --> 24:10.242
They want to believe.

24:12.369 --> 24:13.954
That's why I chose them.

24:17.207 --> 24:18.667
We just need a sign.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.433
Can you feel him?

24:37.310 --> 24:38.478
You are with child?

24:39.104 --> 24:40.480
Don't you feel him?

24:42.440 --> 24:43.441
Yes.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.527
Yes.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.531
The first child
of the new world.

25:06.298 --> 25:07.674
What's the matter with you?

25:12.304 --> 25:13.972
I'm going to be a father.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.349
Skol.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.018
Skol.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.063
Huh.

25:27.986 --> 25:28.987
Hmm.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.294
I want to marry
your daughter.

25:46.838 --> 25:49.257
She is worth far more
than you can ever give.

25:49.674 --> 25:50.675
I know.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.306
So, I will give far more
than I can ever afford.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.062
Very well.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.398
If she wants to.

26:35.053 --> 26:36.054
Snaefrid?

27:41.411 --> 27:44.122
We have a strange custom
in the north.

27:50.295 --> 27:53.298
We half-castrate a reindeer.

27:59.596 --> 28:02.140
But we don't cut the balls
out of the sack.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.728
Instead,

28:07.187 --> 28:08.771
the men hold
the reindeer down.

28:09.898 --> 28:14.235
We women chew the balls
to pieces inside the sack.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.085
So, tell me, Bjorn.

28:32.670 --> 28:35.924
Did you think this was the way
we Sami always got married?

28:39.344 --> 28:43.223
I bet you thought
this was all our custom. Huh?

28:45.350 --> 28:47.352
That's why you allowed me
to tie you up.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.366
I told my father
I was going to marry you

29:02.158 --> 29:03.576
the moment I saw you.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.881
Maybe I won't
chew your balls.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.929
Sami men can last
for many hours.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.442
Freya,

29:39.028 --> 29:40.196
beloved goddess,

29:43.199 --> 29:44.492
think well of me.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.081
See my suffering.

29:53.793 --> 29:54.961
Heal my heart.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.549
And let my prayers
come unto you.

30:07.682 --> 30:10.476
It delights my eyes
to see all of you
working together.

30:12.437 --> 30:13.688
This was my dream.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.567
That we would create
a new kind of world

30:18.443 --> 30:20.069
in which everyone is equal,

30:20.820 --> 30:24.615
contribute equally
to the community,
to the best of their ability.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.827
And those who fall sick
or are injured,

30:27.910 --> 30:29.996
can expect to be looked after
by the rest of us.

30:31.581 --> 30:33.541
We will parcel out
the land fairly,

30:34.584 --> 30:36.502
and only tax those
who can afford to pay.

30:36.586 --> 30:40.381
So, no reason for anyone
to feel hard done by.

30:41.132 --> 30:45.678
We will find a place
for our meetings,
and we will elect a law giver

30:46.137 --> 30:48.973
who will decide
upon the merits
of every case.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.479
There will never be any reason
to use the ax

30:54.562 --> 30:55.855
to settle disputes among us.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.024
No.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.151
This is a new place,

31:01.110 --> 31:02.153
a new land.

31:02.779 --> 31:05.281
And we must try
to be better people,

31:05.990 --> 31:07.617
different people than we were.

31:08.659 --> 31:10.661
That is all
good and well, Floki.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.081
But who will rule us?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.374
Nobody.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.419
We will rule ourselves.

31:22.465 --> 31:24.008
I don't believe you, Floki.

31:26.719 --> 31:27.970
Not for a moment.

31:28.888 --> 31:32.767
I know fairly well
that you want to rule us.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.023
You want to be king.

31:40.525 --> 31:41.609
It's true, isn't it?

31:45.488 --> 31:46.489
Don't deny it.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.450
You want to be king.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.139
It is beautiful.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.084
Then the Lord said unto me,

32:40.168 --> 32:43.045
"Out of the north,
a great evil shall break forth

32:43.129 --> 32:44.964
"upon all the inhabitants
of the land."

32:47.300 --> 32:50.303
Never before in England
had such a terror appeared,

32:51.387 --> 32:54.932
and it first appeared here,
at Lindisfarne.

33:00.313 --> 33:04.692
If the young monk
you mentioned, Athelstan,
was here at that time,

33:05.359 --> 33:07.820
he would have worked
in this scriptorium,

33:08.112 --> 33:10.323
illuminating the words
of our Lord.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.451
He may even
have painted icons.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.662
Although, of course,
he would never have
signed his work.

33:17.413 --> 33:21.375
Even the greatest artists
recognize that they owe
their talent to God.

33:22.293 --> 33:25.755
And that their work
is for His glory
and not for their own.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.508
I never actually met my...

33:30.009 --> 33:31.510
Met Athelstan,

33:32.094 --> 33:35.806
but from what
I've heard about him,
he was a kind and humble man.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.309
I wish I could
tell you more about him.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.520
All I know is
that on that terrible day,

33:41.896 --> 33:44.482
which some thought
was the Day of Judgment,

33:45.233 --> 33:46.943
many of the monks
were killed here.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.153
Others drowned themselves,

33:49.528 --> 33:51.656
trying to escape
the wrath of the Northmen.

33:52.406 --> 33:55.159
But I understand
some were taken away
in their boats,

33:55.243 --> 33:57.245
and sold into slavery.

33:57.328 --> 34:01.999
There is even a story that
one of them returned later
to these shores.

34:03.042 --> 34:07.421
He was an apostate
who had abandoned God,

34:07.797 --> 34:09.674
and embraced
the pagan way of life.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.301
Perhaps it was
all part of God's will.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.428
It seems unlikely.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.222
Which doesn't make it untrue.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.059
Prince, may I ask you,

34:20.935 --> 34:22.895
who was this monk to you?

34:23.646 --> 34:24.939
An inspiration.

34:25.147 --> 34:28.484
Was he not crucified
as an apostate?

34:28.859 --> 34:29.860
Yes.

34:30.528 --> 34:31.821
But he rose again.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.616
I have his cross, here.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.787
But if you never met him...

34:39.954 --> 34:40.997
It was given to me

34:41.914 --> 34:43.499
by Ragnar Lothbrok.

34:44.292 --> 34:45.876
Ragnar Lothbrok?

34:46.294 --> 34:48.462
He led that raid
on this island.

34:48.629 --> 34:50.089
He is the devil incarnate!

34:50.172 --> 34:51.215
My Lord Abbott,

34:51.299 --> 34:54.302
all I know is that the world
is not a simple place.

34:55.928 --> 34:59.223
There is good and evil
in everything and in everyone.

35:00.099 --> 35:03.060
We are all, all of us,
devils and angels.

35:04.812 --> 35:07.023
You might like to put that
into one of your sermons.

35:12.862 --> 35:14.905
There is something else
you might consider.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.160
Are you still conducting
all your business in Latin?

35:19.327 --> 35:22.580
Most people don't speak Latin,
so they think of you
as superior beings,

35:22.663 --> 35:24.874
which, as you explained,
isn't true.

35:24.957 --> 35:27.793
Since you are so humble
and work only
for the glory of God,

35:28.002 --> 35:30.629
God can be glorified
and addressed in English.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.133
And that way,
all the people here
can share your love

35:34.216 --> 35:35.801
and understanding for Him,

35:36.886 --> 35:38.262
as well as share
all the knowledge

35:38.346 --> 35:40.765
contained in all those books
in your library.

35:42.558 --> 35:43.851
It's only a thought.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.859
"And there appeared
a great wonder in heaven,

35:52.777 --> 35:54.987
"a woman clothed with the Sun,

35:55.363 --> 35:57.990
"and the Moon
beneath her feet.

35:59.450 --> 36:05.206
"And upon her head,
a crown of 12 stars."

36:06.123 --> 36:08.459
Who is the woman?
The Virgin.

36:09.251 --> 36:12.963
Mary, mother of our God,
Jesus Christ.

36:15.383 --> 36:18.219
If she was a virgin,
how could she be a mother?

36:18.386 --> 36:20.054
It was a miracle.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.181
I would say so.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.309
Are there not many miraculous
things in your faith?

36:26.727 --> 36:30.022
Like the serpent
whose body holds in the sea.

36:30.523 --> 36:33.692
Well, that's not a miracle.
That is true.

36:33.901 --> 36:34.944
Ah.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.196
One day, Thor was fishing,

36:38.239 --> 36:40.533
and hooked the serpent
by mistake.

36:40.616 --> 36:45.037
And the two of them,
they fought
an almighty battle.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.288
I can imagine.

36:53.337 --> 36:54.797
The moon is a woman.

36:57.550 --> 36:58.759
That's true.

37:00.678 --> 37:03.347
But not a woman
you can trust.

37:06.142 --> 37:09.520
A devious woman,
a woman who drives men insane.

37:10.354 --> 37:14.024
She promises them her love,

37:15.943 --> 37:17.278
and her favors.

37:18.362 --> 37:21.615
But then she changes her mind,
cheats on them,

37:22.491 --> 37:24.034
goes with someone else.

37:29.331 --> 37:32.668
Do you understand
what I am thinking?

37:34.378 --> 37:36.422
You're thinking
I can't be trusted.

37:37.882 --> 37:39.675
That my promises
are worthless.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.597
That I will be as fickle
as the moon.

37:46.098 --> 37:49.101
In my experience,
it happens.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.187
But if you kill me now,

37:51.854 --> 37:55.274
you deny yourself the pleasure
of proving yourself right.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.369
Heahmund, I do not want
to be right.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.790
I want to believe in you.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.336
I want to believe
that in this world,

38:16.378 --> 38:19.423
there is someone
who never lies,

38:19.798 --> 38:20.799
cheats,

38:21.926 --> 38:23.427
or compromises.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.347
Who is always

38:28.015 --> 38:29.099
noble.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.612
I am the one,

38:42.238 --> 38:43.280
Ivar.

38:44.949 --> 38:46.742
You can believe in me.

38:54.875 --> 38:56.001
We'll see.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.113
Our numbers are growing.

39:25.281 --> 39:26.282
Good.

39:39.003 --> 39:40.546
Where shall
we meet them?

39:40.629 --> 39:43.799
They would expect us
to defend Kattegat
by a seaborne attack.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.634
So, they won't attack by sea?

39:45.718 --> 39:46.802
I don't think so.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.556
In my experience,
Ivar never does
what you expect him to do.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.351
So, what should we do?

39:55.227 --> 39:57.688
If Ivar brings his army
across the land,

39:58.689 --> 40:00.024
we should try
and intercept him.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.403
And choose a battleground
that suits us.

40:04.653 --> 40:05.654
Exactly.

40:06.113 --> 40:09.116
Ivar always likes to scout
his battlegrounds
before any battle,

40:09.199 --> 40:11.327
so he can use the features
of the land to his advantage.

40:12.619 --> 40:16.290
However, if we take
that ability away,
then we have the advantage.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.625
The battleground
must include forest.

40:18.709 --> 40:21.170
That is where the Sami
best use their skills.

40:21.253 --> 40:22.629
If they attack from the east?

40:22.713 --> 40:24.214
We should fight them
on Scar Mountain.

40:26.842 --> 40:28.177
There's one more thing.

40:28.719 --> 40:29.720
In his cleverness,

40:29.803 --> 40:32.681
if Ivar does bring his army
across the land,

40:33.432 --> 40:35.142
the ships he leaves behind
will be vulnerable.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.226
Yes.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.228
And once we engage with them,

40:39.063 --> 40:40.981
he will become
very aware of that.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.902
Then he will have to keep back
a significant amount
of his warriors

40:45.652 --> 40:47.279
and my brother's warriors

40:49.448 --> 40:51.408
to prevent us
outflanking them,

40:52.534 --> 40:54.286
and reaching
their ships first.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.372
I like that.

40:57.748 --> 41:00.667
The less warriors
he commits to the field...

41:00.751 --> 41:02.961
The greater
our chances of prevailing.

41:05.464 --> 41:06.840
On the other hand,

41:07.633 --> 41:09.802
Ivar may have anticipated
all of this.

41:11.178 --> 41:12.179
In which case...

41:13.389 --> 41:17.059
In which case,
he will attack Kattegat
by sea, after all.

41:17.893 --> 41:18.894
And we won't be here.

41:20.354 --> 41:23.732
He will just take Kattegat
without even a fight.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.361
We have to choose.

41:29.405 --> 41:31.156
And I think Bjorn is right.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.588
Father, I came here
to try and find you,

41:50.634 --> 41:52.010
but you are not here.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.263
But I'm not worried.

41:55.597 --> 41:58.016
You are everywhere,
especially in my heart.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.271
I think you are here now,

42:03.689 --> 42:06.483
looking down and smiling
at your foolish son.

42:10.487 --> 42:13.031
I know you
for a humble man, Father.

42:16.827 --> 42:19.580
But I cannot promise
to follow you
in those footsteps.

42:20.789 --> 42:22.583
I do not aim to be humble.

42:25.002 --> 42:29.298
All I can think of
is that we say
Our Lord's Prayer together,

42:31.091 --> 42:32.176
you and I.

42:42.144 --> 42:44.897
Our Father,
which art in heaven,

42:45.814 --> 42:47.274
hallowed be Thy name.

42:47.983 --> 42:51.904
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

42:53.155 --> 42:55.240
Give us this day
our daily bread...

43:00.496 --> 43:01.538
Father.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.793
And forgive us our trespasses

43:07.586 --> 43:10.380
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

43:11.006 --> 43:13.217
<i>Lead us not into temptation,</i>

43:15.219 --> 43:17.346
<i>but deliver us from evil,</i>

43:18.597 --> 43:19.598
<i>forever</i>

43:20.766 --> 43:21.892
<i>and ever.</i>

43:22.893 --> 43:23.894
<i>Amen.</i>

43:39.826 --> 43:40.869
It's time.

43:44.164 --> 43:46.208
The end of our world is here.
