00:03.790 --> 00:05.580
Aaah!

00:05.580 --> 00:07.210
Uggh!

00:07.210 --> 00:09.380
(blades clanging)

00:09.380 --> 00:13.040
You sure it was a good idea
to come without the rest
of your buddies?

00:13.040 --> 00:14.380
Baymax!

00:14.380 --> 00:16.460
(Hiro gasping)

00:16.460 --> 00:18.170
-Ha ha!
-(alarm beeping)

00:18.170 --> 00:20.420
-What's that?
-It is an alarm.

00:20.420 --> 00:24.380
Hiro, we must leave
for your meeting with
Professor Granville soon.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.250
(gasping)
Wait, that was today?

00:26.250 --> 00:28.420
Yes. It is in
eight minutes.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.290
Excuse me,
we're fighting here.

00:30.290 --> 00:31.420
Haaah!

00:31.420 --> 00:32.750
(beep)

00:32.750 --> 00:35.380
(whoosh)

00:35.380 --> 00:39.080
-There you are.
-Sorry, Globby,
gotta wrap this up.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.080
(beep)

00:41.080 --> 00:44.580
Hey! (stammering, groaning)

00:44.580 --> 00:46.920
-Baymax, you OK?
-I am sticky.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.960
Globby: Catch ya later!

00:47.960 --> 00:49.750
(gurgling)

00:49.750 --> 00:51.460
Well, at least he
didn't get this.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.500
(clanging)

00:53.500 --> 00:57.250
Titanium shell biometric lock?
This is some serious security.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.040
I wonder what's inside.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.920
Baymax: Hiro, your meeting
is now in seven minutes.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.710
Is your final project
proposal ready?

01:04.710 --> 01:08.710
Uh, not exactly, but I've
still got some time, right?

01:08.710 --> 01:10.460
How long till
we get back to SFIT?

01:10.460 --> 01:14.460
-Approximately 7.5 minutes.
-See? Plenty of time.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.620
-(thrusters roaring)
-Hiro: Oh...

01:20.750 --> 01:22.620
I am still sticky.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.710
Hello. I am Baymax.

♪ Whoa-oh ♪

♪ Whoa-oh ♪

01:54.880 --> 01:58.250
Thus, for my final project,
I propose an investigation

01:58.250 --> 02:00.330
into Lenore Shimamoto's
scientific work.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.790
-(tablet beeps)
-Your project is approved.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.620
(softly) Stall.

02:04.620 --> 02:08.330
I mean, she kept it all secret.
It's pretty fascinating,
you have to admit.

02:08.330 --> 02:11.040
Yes. That's why I approved
your project.

02:11.040 --> 02:15.960
Why was it a secret?
That's the big question.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.250
Which... I...

02:19.250 --> 02:20.620
will attempt...

02:20.620 --> 02:22.330
-(Hiro panting)
-...to answer.

02:22.330 --> 02:24.250
I hear you panting,
Mr. Hamada.

02:24.250 --> 02:28.580
Uh... Hey, Professor Granville.
Is it my turn already?

02:28.580 --> 02:30.170
So it is, Mr. Hamada.

02:30.170 --> 02:32.170
I hope you put as much thought

02:32.170 --> 02:33.250
into your proposal

02:33.250 --> 02:34.540
as your friends did.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.670
Yeah, about that.

02:36.670 --> 02:40.290
-You have nothing?
-I have nothing. (sighs)

02:40.290 --> 02:43.000
I'm sorry, Professor Granville.
I've just been... overscheduled?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.540
-With?
-Things.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.000
Lots of things.
Can I maybe get an extension?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.540
Unfortunately, Mr. Hamada,
the rules apply to everyone.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.040
Even you.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.290
Remember, your
final project counts

02:56.290 --> 02:58.710
for 60% of
your first-semester grade.

02:58.710 --> 03:01.540
-That much?
-If you hope to see

03:01.540 --> 03:04.120
this smiling face again
next semester,

03:04.120 --> 03:06.460
I suggest you step up.

03:06.460 --> 03:08.460
-I will.
-By the deadline!

03:08.460 --> 03:12.120
-Right. I will not be--
-Late! Really sorry I'm late,
Professor Granville.

03:12.120 --> 03:16.120
Given that you aren't
a student, you don't need
to be here at all.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.960
Oh. Does that mean you don't
want to see my mascot
final project?

03:19.960 --> 03:22.250
There is no mascot
final project.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.000
But it involves
sparklers. Watch.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.920
-(sparklers sizzling)
-(Fred exclaiming)

03:26.920 --> 03:29.580
Baymax: Fred, that does
not appear safe.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.330
-(crash)
-(Fred groaning)

03:32.330 --> 03:35.330
Baymax: On a scale
of one to ten...

03:38.250 --> 03:41.880
So, I have Big Hero 6
to thank for the mess
in my warehouse.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.040
We stopped Globby
from taking this,
but why do you want it?

03:45.040 --> 03:46.580
What's in
the briefcase, Krei?

03:46.580 --> 03:48.420
Uh, nothing.

03:48.420 --> 03:51.920
Baymax: My scan indicates
that there is not
"nothing" inside.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.330
Well, it's nothing valuable.
See for yourselves.

03:55.330 --> 03:58.170
A few years ago,
Krei Tech-- and every
other tech company--

03:58.170 --> 03:59.710
was trying to create
an energy amplifier.

03:59.710 --> 04:02.120
Is it supposed to look
like a burnt Noodle Burger?

04:02.120 --> 04:04.500
-Pretty sure no.
-Bleeding edge technology

04:04.500 --> 04:07.380
that would exponentially
multiply the output
of any power source.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.620
But there were...
complications.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.120
-(man screaming)
-woman: There are
complications!

04:12.120 --> 04:14.540
-(fire roaring)
-(phone beeps)

04:14.540 --> 04:17.380
Call the fire
department... again.

04:17.380 --> 04:21.330
What? Everyone lived.
And we all learned
a very important lesson:

04:21.330 --> 04:24.880
-the energy amplifying business
is not a sound investment.
-So it was a massive fail.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.710
It was not technically failure
if the whole idea was impossible
in the first place.

04:28.710 --> 04:31.500
Impossible? You sure?

04:31.500 --> 04:34.830
My people say it is,
and as clever as you all are,

04:34.830 --> 04:37.330
I hired the best
and the brightest
in the business

04:37.330 --> 04:38.790
and they couldn't
crack it.

04:38.790 --> 04:41.330
It was just one giant
warehouse fire
after another.

04:41.330 --> 04:44.790
The warehouses always pay
for our mistakes.
It's not fair.

04:44.790 --> 04:46.580
Then why did Globby
try to steal it?

04:46.580 --> 04:49.790
Maybe he collects garbage.
Because that's what this is.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.920
-Expensive garbage,
but still garbage.
-(clang)

04:52.920 --> 04:56.080
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting with R&D

04:56.080 --> 04:59.080
about something that is both
possible and profitable.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.500
Fireproof warehouses.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.790
Thanks for helping me
carry my stuff, Wasabi.

05:07.790 --> 05:10.750
-Ooh! I am so excited
about my final project.
-(Wasabi gasps)

05:10.750 --> 05:14.620
Are you sure you wanna
spend a lot of time
in here, Honey Lemon?

05:14.620 --> 05:15.670
What do you mean?

05:15.670 --> 05:17.880
It's just so...
aaah!... unclean.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.540
Unclean! Ugh!
What is that, even?

05:20.540 --> 05:23.210
-Wait, was that...?
-Did you just see that?

05:24.790 --> 05:28.250
This math is way ahead
of Shimamoto's time.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.880
Honey Lemon:
"Mum's the word"?

05:29.880 --> 05:32.080
Shimamoto had a secret.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.580
There's more here
than just equations.

05:34.580 --> 05:37.290
It's gotta be a clue.
We have to go back!

05:37.290 --> 05:40.210
-To a cleaner environment?
-No, to Shimamoto's lab.

05:40.210 --> 05:41.880
It was worth a shot.

05:44.420 --> 05:47.210
Huh. This might be doable.

05:47.210 --> 05:50.380
Am I to believe this
is your final project,
Mr. Hamada?

05:50.380 --> 05:52.580
Uh, yes?
I mean, yes.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.460
-It is.
-What is it?

05:54.460 --> 05:55.670
Baymax:
Expensive garbage.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.920
Uh, no, Baymax.
I'm making
an energy amplifier.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.710
An energy amplifier?

06:00.710 --> 06:02.580
This is not what I
expected from you.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.460
I know, me neither.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.670
But I think if I can minimize
energy lost as heat through--

06:06.670 --> 06:09.750
-Impossible.
-Well, it won't
be easy but--

06:09.750 --> 06:13.330
I mean that I reject
this proposal because
it is impossible.

06:13.330 --> 06:16.250
What? No. I think I'm
really onto something here.
Look at my--

06:16.250 --> 06:17.920
Arrogance showing?

06:17.920 --> 06:21.830
This is too advanced
an undertaking, Mr. Hamada,
even for you.

06:21.830 --> 06:25.330
Professor Granville, this could
revolutionize energy efficiency
and change--

06:25.330 --> 06:27.580
It's also
incredibly dangerous.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.460
Try to think responsibly
for once!

06:29.460 --> 06:33.250
I am, but you're not listening,
because you don't think
I can do it.

06:33.250 --> 06:37.830
It is not always
a question of "can,"
Mr. Hamada.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.670
Sometimes it's whether
you should.

06:40.670 --> 06:43.790
But I can.
So I should.

06:43.790 --> 06:46.290
(sighs)

06:46.290 --> 06:48.920
My decision is final.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.210
Come up with
another proposal.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.580
And soon.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.960
Baymax: Hiro, you still
have time to devise
an alternate proposal.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.620
-May I help?
-It's OK, Baymax.

06:58.620 --> 07:01.620
-I've already got a backup plan.
-Baymax: That is excellent news.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.250
-I'm gonna prove
Professor Granville wrong.
-Baymax: I do not understand.

07:04.250 --> 07:07.080
I'm going to work
on the amplifier,
you know, in secret.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.790
Baymax: Her decision was final.
Would you like me
to play it back?

07:09.790 --> 07:11.830
Granville:
My decision is final.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.960
Yeah, I heard.
But if I pull this off--

07:14.960 --> 07:19.380
and I definitely will--
then Granville will be
too impressed to be mad.

07:19.380 --> 07:22.460
Let's go, Baymax.
I'm gonna make her
eat her words.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.460
Baymax: That is not
physically possible.

07:24.460 --> 07:29.460
Well... I'm going to do
a lot of impossible things.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.170
(machine whirring)

07:33.670 --> 07:35.500
(beeping)

07:38.000 --> 07:39.830
(clanging)

07:39.830 --> 07:42.250
-(crash)
-(whoosh)

07:42.250 --> 07:45.000
Speed's good. Just gotta
make it less deadly.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.960
Go Go! Go Go!

07:46.960 --> 07:49.920
Mini-Max: Cease combustion,
tiny flame.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.420
Go Go, I have the perfect
plan to catch Obake.

07:53.420 --> 07:54.920
What's the plan, Fred?

07:54.920 --> 07:58.420
-Well, I'm glad you asked.
-And now I'm not.

07:58.420 --> 08:01.380
Globby has been trying
to steal Krei's
energy amplifier.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.750
And Globby's been working
for Obake.

08:03.750 --> 08:07.540
If we set a trap
for Globby, making him think
we have an energy amplifier,

08:07.540 --> 08:09.080
we can catch Globby

08:09.080 --> 08:11.580
and make Globby
lead us to Obake.

08:11.580 --> 08:14.210
-Not bad.
-The action figures
sold it, right?

08:14.210 --> 08:15.420
-No...
-Aaaah!

08:15.420 --> 08:16.580
That part
was stupid.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.250
But it's a good plan.
I'm in.

08:18.250 --> 08:21.380
Yes!
Plan Fred is a go!

08:21.380 --> 08:23.120
"Yeah!"
"All right."

08:23.120 --> 08:24.830
"Fred's a real genius!"

08:32.170 --> 08:35.880
Baymax: Hiro, you have
been working for 7.3 hours.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.830
Research indicates that fatigue
can lead to cognitive
impairment.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.670
I have brought you a sandwich.

08:41.670 --> 08:43.620
Thanks, Baymax.
You're the best.

08:43.620 --> 08:46.210
What is the status of
your unsanctioned research?

08:46.210 --> 08:48.750
Um, I'm definitely
onto something.

08:48.750 --> 08:51.460
-(beeping)
-Fred: Hiro!
-What's up, Fred?

08:51.460 --> 08:53.670
-I'm kinda busy.
-Fred: Oh, no big deal.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.920
-Fred: I just have
a plan to capture Globby!
-Uh-huh. That's great.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.210
Isn't it?
We just need to convince Krei

08:59.210 --> 09:02.250
to pretend like he completed
the amplifying thingamajig
and lure Globby out.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.620
Then we catch Globby in the act
and take out Obake.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.290
Sounds good.
Baymax and I are in.

09:07.290 --> 09:10.290
I actually got the idea
from my--

09:10.290 --> 09:13.420
Baymax: Hiro. I have finished
my risk assessment

09:13.420 --> 09:15.620
of your unsanctioned
final project.

09:15.620 --> 09:18.250
There is an 80% chance
of failure.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.960
Huh. That's not
so bad.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.830
Baymax: Within that 80%,
there is a 96% chance
of disastrous failure.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.620
I have concerns.
I will list them now.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.960
One, fiery explosions.

09:29.960 --> 09:34.040
Uh, yeah, thanks
for the analysis, Baymax,
but I'll be fine, really.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.880
-Baymax: Two, electrocution.
-(sparks zapping)

09:35.880 --> 09:36.920
Three...

09:38.960 --> 09:42.250
This is possibly worse
than the museum.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.880
She hid the journal
in a secret compartment.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.790
Maybe there's another one.

09:49.830 --> 09:52.460
-(plane buzzing)
-(crash)

09:52.460 --> 09:54.880
(Wasabi groans)

09:54.880 --> 09:58.170
Wasabi: Right.
I'm just not gonna move
from this spot anymore.

09:58.170 --> 10:01.620
Ewww. By which I mean
from this spot.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.460
(shrieks) Uggh!

10:03.460 --> 10:05.500
(sighs) That was close.

10:05.500 --> 10:10.170
Huh. Shimamoto liked
chrysanthemums.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.330
-That's it.
-What's it?

10:12.330 --> 10:14.540
People used to call
chrysanthemums "mums."

10:14.540 --> 10:16.580
"Mum's the word"!
The vase!

10:16.580 --> 10:19.670
-That's what the clue leads to.
-Maybe there's something inside.

10:19.670 --> 10:20.790
(coughing)

10:20.790 --> 10:23.000
Hundred-year-old pollen!
I'm out.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.290
Or maybe there's
something outside.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.960
It's a wax cylinder.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.710
Like an old-timey record?

10:30.710 --> 10:33.670
Hmm. Lenore Shimamoto
wanted us

10:33.670 --> 10:35.500
to hear whatever
she recorded on this.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.460
Great. So how
do we play it?

10:37.460 --> 10:41.000
I have an idea,
but you're not
gonna like it.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.170
-You were right:
I don't like it.
-Told you.

10:44.170 --> 10:47.710
Are we gonna go
to every gross place
in this town today?

10:47.710 --> 10:48.960
-(Wasabi screams)
-(thud)

10:51.880 --> 10:53.210
Whoaaaa! Ooh!

10:53.210 --> 10:55.830
-Ohh!
-(splat)

10:57.540 --> 10:59.420
-(mouse squeaking)
-Aaaaah!

10:59.420 --> 11:01.540
-Shhh! Or we'll
trigger the...
-(alarm blaring)

11:01.540 --> 11:03.380
...security system.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.460
-(whoosh)
-(Honey Lemon gasps)

11:05.460 --> 11:08.250
(machine rattling)

11:08.250 --> 11:10.040
(flames roaring)

11:13.750 --> 11:16.540
-(whoosh)
-Aaaaah!

11:16.540 --> 11:18.380
Let me see if I understand.

11:18.380 --> 11:20.880
You want me to throw
a fake press conference

11:20.880 --> 11:24.920
and pretend I have a product
that doesn't exist
so a monster will attack me.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.380
Uh-huh.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.880
Oh, and if you could
do it by tomorrow,
that'd be great.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.880
No?

11:30.880 --> 11:34.040
No to tomorrow,
or no to...?

11:34.040 --> 11:36.080
No to everything.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.920
Mini-Max: Fear not,
Captain of Industry.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.540
I will be your
steadfast guardian!

11:40.540 --> 11:43.880
This tiny Baymax is
strangely compelling.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.210
I want one.

11:45.210 --> 11:47.580
I am Mini-Max,
defender of good!

11:47.580 --> 11:50.580
And I promise you that we
shall bring Globby,

11:50.580 --> 11:53.750
the villain who stole
your wallet, to justice.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.920
That's right.
Globby did steal my wallet.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.880
OK, you have a deal.
Let's do it.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.290
Fred: Yes!
We're on it, Mr. Krei.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.250
I made it weird,
didn't I?

12:06.250 --> 12:07.790
(Wasabi and Honey Lemon
screaming)

12:07.790 --> 12:10.290
-(crash)
-Wasabi: Uggh!

12:10.290 --> 12:12.710
-(both gasp)
-Honey Lemon: Run!

12:12.710 --> 12:14.120
(Wasabi panting)

12:14.120 --> 12:17.000
-I'll keep it busy!
-I'll cut off the power!

12:17.000 --> 12:18.460
(straining)

12:18.460 --> 12:20.790
-(clang)
-(thwack)

12:20.790 --> 12:22.790
Agggh!

12:22.790 --> 12:25.250
-(Wasabi gasping)
-(machine pounding)

12:25.250 --> 12:28.460
OK, it's busy!

12:28.460 --> 12:29.750
(whoosh)

12:29.750 --> 12:31.500
(Wasabi straining)

12:33.790 --> 12:35.330
Yaaaaa!

12:35.330 --> 12:37.290
Whoaaa! Ooh!

12:37.290 --> 12:39.620
(metal clanging)

12:39.620 --> 12:41.830
-(cheerful
music playing)
-Hey!

12:41.830 --> 12:44.250
(debris rattling)

12:44.250 --> 12:46.330
-(clang)
-(motors whirring)

12:46.330 --> 12:48.830
Oh, come on! (screams)

12:48.830 --> 12:50.250
Whoaaaa!

12:50.250 --> 12:52.290
(steam hissing)

12:52.290 --> 12:53.790
(Wasabi shrieking)

12:56.670 --> 12:58.380
-(crash)
-Wasabi!

12:58.380 --> 12:59.500
(screaming)

13:03.880 --> 13:07.500
(sighs) Let's see
if this old thing works.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.330
Von Steamer: Baron's log.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.540
On this day, I,
Baron Von Steamer,

13:12.540 --> 13:16.120
proclaim that my latest scheme
to defeat Boss Awesome

13:16.120 --> 13:17.750
cannot fail!

13:17.750 --> 13:20.920
Victory will be mine!

13:20.920 --> 13:22.920
Gotta admire
his confidence.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.920
Von Steamer: Baron's log.
Addendum.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.330
Victory was not mine.
(sobbing)

13:29.330 --> 13:32.040
OK, clearly
a private moment.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.880
Good news,
the player works.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.040
We'll just borrow it.
I'll leave a note.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.880
Baymax: Hiro.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.330
Hiro.

13:47.330 --> 13:48.830
(cat meows)

13:51.540 --> 13:54.040
Hiro. It is time to go.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.960
Baymax?
Is it morning already?

13:55.960 --> 13:59.580
Yes. The press conference
will begin in 20 minutes.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.880
I can't stop now.
I'm in the zone.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.460
Baymax: Fred and Go Go
require backup.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.210
I know, but I'm so
close to finishing.

14:06.210 --> 14:09.580
I had a breakthrough
and I just need a little
more time to...

14:09.580 --> 14:12.750
Baymax, can you do me
a huge favor and head
to Krei Tech first?

14:12.750 --> 14:14.500
Baymax: Without you?

14:14.500 --> 14:17.250
Yeah, without me.
I'm just so close on this.

14:17.250 --> 14:21.040
-Don't worry, I'll catch up.
-Baymax: I will go.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.420
Without you.

14:25.790 --> 14:27.210
Goodbye.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.040
(applause)

14:35.250 --> 14:37.460
-Hiro's late.
-Or maybe we're early.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.580
We're not early.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.420
Finally.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.750
Wait, where's Hiro?

14:42.750 --> 14:45.080
Baymax: Hiro said that
he would "catch up."

14:45.080 --> 14:47.080
-That was not part
of the plan.
-Relax, Go Go.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.580
Even if Hiro doesn't make it,
the three of us and Mini-Max

14:49.580 --> 14:51.880
-are more than enough
to handle Globby.
-(static feedback)

14:51.880 --> 14:55.170
Once again, Krei Tech Industries
has done the impossible.

14:55.170 --> 14:58.830
I present to you all
the energy amplifying thing...

14:58.830 --> 15:00.120
-(crackling)
-uh...

15:00.120 --> 15:03.960
which we, uh, like to call...

15:03.960 --> 15:06.960
Pa... trick... Patrick.
That's it, Patrick.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.330
Are you going to open it,
or what? We're rolling.

15:09.330 --> 15:12.710
Y-Yes.
I'm going to do that.

15:12.710 --> 15:15.750
Now. Right...

15:15.750 --> 15:16.790
now-- Aaaah!

15:16.790 --> 15:19.540
And I'll be taking this.
Yoink.

15:19.540 --> 15:20.750
Let's go!

15:21.960 --> 15:23.790
-(whoosh)
-Uggh!

15:23.790 --> 15:26.380
Noodle Burger Boy: Howdy
and hello, burger buddies.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.460
We're here to toast your buns.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.330
Oh no.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.420
Baymax: Buns. I get it.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.460
(whoosh)

15:40.460 --> 15:42.330
Fred: Next! Now!

15:42.330 --> 15:44.170
Mini-Max: Mini-maximum
rocket punch!

15:44.170 --> 15:46.420
Gaaah. Just kidding.

15:46.420 --> 15:50.000
-(glass shatters)
-Well played,
gelatinous foe.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.750
-Fred: I'll get him!
-(whoosh)

15:51.750 --> 15:55.000
(splat)

15:55.000 --> 15:58.670
Fred: This is not how I saw
my plan going when it
was in my head.

15:58.670 --> 16:01.380
-You don't say.
-Lemme show you how
I see it going.

16:01.380 --> 16:02.880
Aaaah!

16:02.880 --> 16:04.420
-(thud)
-Uggh!

16:04.420 --> 16:06.290
(laughing diabolically)

16:10.710 --> 16:12.460
(roars)

16:12.460 --> 16:14.580
He can turn into a dinosaur?

16:14.580 --> 16:17.250
Fred: Honestly, I'm surprised
he hasn't done it before.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.830
But look at those tiny,
useless arms!

16:19.830 --> 16:22.120
-Oh, ya think?
-(whoosh)

16:22.120 --> 16:23.500
Fred: Ow!

16:29.460 --> 16:30.880
There's too many of them.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.210
Breaking news from Krei Tech
Industries, literally!

16:34.210 --> 16:36.540
-(thwack)
-Baymax: Oh, no.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.880
-(glass shatters)
-(thud)

16:40.880 --> 16:44.040
Hee-hee, hee-hee, hee-hee.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.960
This is it, Wasabi.
This could be the secret behind
Shimamoto's great discovery.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.710
-Are you ready?
-(phone beeping)

16:49.710 --> 16:51.670
Go Go?
We're kinda busy.

16:51.670 --> 16:53.040
Go Go: Are you kidding me?!

16:53.040 --> 16:56.040
Aaah! Noodle Burger Boy
and Globby attacking Krei Tech.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.040
Need backup. Hurry!

17:04.210 --> 17:08.250
-Okay. Just gotta
test it out.
-(phone buzzing)

17:14.210 --> 17:16.080
(sparking, whirring)

17:16.080 --> 17:17.580
(beeping)

17:17.580 --> 17:20.080
Hiro: Ah! It's working.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.380
-(buzzer sounding)
-(sparks zapping)

17:22.380 --> 17:24.250
-(boom)
-(Hiro shrieking)

17:27.210 --> 17:29.210
-(buzzing stops)
-(device powers down)

17:29.210 --> 17:31.250
It's working!
Baymax, did you...?

17:31.250 --> 17:34.040
(phone buzzes)

17:34.040 --> 17:37.250
-Oh no. No.
-(phone chimes)

17:37.250 --> 17:40.830
-No, no, no, no, no!
-(phone beeping)

17:40.830 --> 17:42.580
(whooshing)

17:52.790 --> 17:55.120
Go Go: Baymax, you have
to fight back.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.880
Fred: Say "rocket fist!"
Arggh!

17:57.880 --> 17:59.210
(clang)

17:59.210 --> 18:01.710
Go Go:
Baymax, rocket fist!

18:01.710 --> 18:03.380
(monitor beeping)

18:03.380 --> 18:05.290
-Baymax: Oh, no.
-(clang)

18:07.580 --> 18:09.290
Noodle Burger Boy:
Golly, mister,

18:09.290 --> 18:12.080
I've got a special
order for you.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.790
Baymax: Reboot.
Data packet invalid.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.120
Reboot. Internal
authentication error.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.960
Reboot. Reboot protocol
malfunction-- reboot...

18:22.330 --> 18:24.210
-Baymax!
-(clang)

18:36.460 --> 18:37.540
Thanks.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.830
-Aaaah!
-(Globby roars, spits)

18:40.830 --> 18:43.750
-Fred: Uggh!
-Give me my wallet
back, Globby!

18:43.750 --> 18:45.500
It was a gift
from my accountant.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.830
Well, I lost it.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.250
You are a monster!

18:49.250 --> 18:53.460
Guys. This stuff is
oozing into "places."

18:53.460 --> 18:57.750
Hang on, Fred,
I'm coming! Uggh!

18:57.750 --> 18:59.500
(straining)

18:59.500 --> 19:01.670
Uh-oh.
I'm stuck.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.500
Like, really stuck.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.580
Fred: Yeah. Man,
that's really in there.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.580
-(Globby snarling)
-Mini-Max: Fear not,
friend Krei.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.710
Take this,
you pint-sized pest!

19:10.710 --> 19:12.080
(boom)

19:17.420 --> 19:20.960
(screeches)

19:20.960 --> 19:23.670
(screaming)

19:26.460 --> 19:27.540
Ugggh!

19:31.170 --> 19:33.120
-Order's up, misters.
-(beeping)

19:33.120 --> 19:36.710
(engine revving)

19:36.710 --> 19:38.080
(tires screech)

19:40.080 --> 19:42.580
(crash)

19:42.580 --> 19:46.420
-Ow!
-Not good, not good.

19:46.420 --> 19:47.670
(splat)

19:47.670 --> 19:50.210
-(Fred gasps)
-(Burger Boy clanging)

19:50.210 --> 19:52.830
Noodle Burger Boy: Golly,
mister, this is not swell.

19:52.830 --> 19:55.620
-(Globby bubbling)
-Well, that's our cue.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.500
(sighs) Sorry I'm late.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.750
Where were you?

20:00.750 --> 20:02.500
I kinda lost track of time.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.750
Uh, doing what?

20:03.750 --> 20:05.750
My final project.
Wait'll you guys see.

20:05.750 --> 20:09.250
That's great, Hiro,
but someone could have
really gotten hurt today.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.920
We needed you.
Baymax needed you.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.670
(gasps) Oh, no.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.920
Baymax? (straining)

20:15.920 --> 20:17.540
Baymax?

20:17.540 --> 20:20.000
-(metal clanging)
-(electronics whir)

20:20.000 --> 20:22.080
Baymax: Reboot complete.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.620
Hello. I am Baymax.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.750
Baymax. Are you OK?
Talk to me, buddy.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.830
-Where's the damage?
-Baymax: I briefly
malfunctioned.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.080
I am fine.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.710
(water sloshes)

20:34.620 --> 20:36.460
Guys, I'm really sorry.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.460
I didn't mean to let you
down like that.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.920
We know.
But don't do it again.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.540
Fred: I forgive you, Hiro.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.750
I mean, my super perfect plan
didn't work cuz Globby got away,

20:45.750 --> 20:47.790
probably a little
your fault,

20:47.790 --> 20:50.120
but there are two positive
takeaways from all this.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.960
One, I got to fight
a dinosaur, which was awesome,

20:53.960 --> 20:57.250
and two, all they stole was
an empty briefcase.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.420
My lawyer gave me
that briefcase.

20:59.420 --> 21:03.540
Mini-Max: I offer
my consolation,
wealthy citizen.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.830
-(clang)
-(thud)

21:07.830 --> 21:10.170
Momakase: Obake will
not like this.

21:10.170 --> 21:12.250
Actually, I'm thrilled.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.830
Everything went exactly
as planned.

21:14.830 --> 21:17.830
-I don't get it.
-Of course you don't.

21:17.830 --> 21:20.670
Krei's pack of simpletons
couldn't finish the job.

21:20.670 --> 21:25.380
I needed the services
of someone truly gifted.

21:26.830 --> 21:28.960
(sparks zapping)

21:35.670 --> 21:38.210
(sparks zapping)

21:49.920 --> 21:52.750
OK, if my math is right,
the results from
this energy amplifier

21:52.750 --> 21:54.500
should be off the charts.

21:54.500 --> 21:58.040
Baymax: The results appear
to be on the chart.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.830
I meant,
incredibly amazing.

21:59.830 --> 22:01.880
Baymax: Oh. Hyperbole.

22:01.880 --> 22:06.080
Now, I just need to test it
before showing it off
at open house.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.750
-(sparks zapping)
-Only 1%.

22:07.750 --> 22:10.790
If my modifications work,
no overload this time.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.540
-(whirring)
-Good, good...

22:12.540 --> 22:15.920
-(beeping)
-Oh, look, it's working.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.920
Baymax: Yes. It is also
about to combust.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.880
Monoammonium phosphate
is required.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.080
Were those results
off the charts?

22:26.080 --> 22:29.500
-Slightly.
-I detect Professor
Granville approaching.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.040
I estimate she will
be here in two...

22:32.040 --> 22:35.040
-Mr. Hamada.
-...seconds or less.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.580
What happened to your phone?

22:36.580 --> 22:38.750
Krei Tech, you know?

22:38.750 --> 22:41.080
I do. They're trash.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.290
However, I'm here to discuss
your final project.

22:44.290 --> 22:47.120
I'm just still kicking
around a few ideas.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.170
This is no time
for idea foosball.

22:50.170 --> 22:53.040
The open house
is tomorrow.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.420
Are you hiding something,
Mr. Hamada?

22:55.420 --> 22:57.540
Hiro: Professor Granville,
I am shocked.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.080
After all we've
been through?

22:59.080 --> 23:01.920
Baymax: Professor,
the sound of your grinding teeth

23:01.920 --> 23:03.750
indicates stress.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.920
Our boy genius is
on the verge of failing

23:05.920 --> 23:08.420
and is clearly hiding
something from me,

23:08.420 --> 23:10.620
so yes, I am a little stressed.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.540
-Baymax: Would
you like a hug?
-I would not.

23:13.540 --> 23:17.790
Next time we talk, Mr. Hamada,
I expect results.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.330
-(door closes)
-(sighs)

23:21.290 --> 23:24.790
She wants results,
let's give her some results.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.460
So you just took this?

23:28.460 --> 23:31.620
-We left a lot of notes.
-And we wiped everything down.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.120
-To erase your fingerprints?
-No, just to tidy up.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.620
So, are we gonna
play it or what?

23:36.620 --> 23:38.620
Ohh! This is so exciting!

23:38.620 --> 23:43.960
For the first time ever,
Lenore Shimamoto,
in her own words.

23:43.960 --> 23:48.460
(garbled voice playing)

23:48.460 --> 23:50.710
Are we sure
those are words?

23:50.710 --> 23:52.500
Hmm, something's
not right.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.960
Oh! This is nasty.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.620
Yeah. A hundred years' worth
of dirt and dust will do that.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.420
Wasabi: Good thing I brought
my detergency kit.

24:01.420 --> 24:05.670
The key is to have
the proper tool for the job.

24:05.670 --> 24:09.750
Ahh! I knew the hummingbird
would come in handy one day.

24:09.750 --> 24:12.210
Oh, we have to have it ready
for the open house tomorrow.

24:12.210 --> 24:16.000
The hummingbird,
Honey Lemon, tiny but mighty.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.620
(whirring)

24:19.620 --> 24:21.830
Impressive.

24:21.830 --> 24:24.580
-What? I'm
being sincere.
-Really?

24:24.580 --> 24:27.250
Well, not completely.
Like 80%.

24:27.250 --> 24:30.250
That's really
not bad, Wasabi.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.250
(crickets chirping)

24:32.250 --> 24:36.170
Baymax: These snacks
are unhealthy.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.920
(sparks zapping)

24:37.920 --> 24:40.040
(buzzing)

24:40.040 --> 24:41.500
Aaaah!

24:41.500 --> 24:43.460
Baymax: And dangerous.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.040
(Hiro straining)

24:51.880 --> 24:55.040
I need to test it on something
big enough to handle
the power surge.

24:55.040 --> 24:59.670
Hiro, I've gotta show you
something and it cannot wait--

24:59.670 --> 25:01.960
Mm! Garlic ranch.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.250
Seriously, my fave.

25:04.250 --> 25:07.540
-(squawks)
-OK, you can
open your eyes.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.710
Behold! Kentucky Kaiju 2.0.

25:10.710 --> 25:14.920
I know, I know, the last one
almost destroyed the city,
but this one...

25:14.920 --> 25:16.080
Is perfect for my tech.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.830
I don't know what you're
talking about,

25:17.830 --> 25:21.210
but last one into
the dangerous monster
is a rotten egg.

25:21.210 --> 25:24.830
Baymax: Rotten eggs can cause
gastrointestinal distress.
It is also common...

25:24.830 --> 25:27.040
Probably should warn you,
this might be a bad idea.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.250
-"This might be a bad idea"
is my middle name.
-(monitor beeping)

25:31.250 --> 25:33.290
(roars)

25:33.290 --> 25:34.880
(clang)

25:37.170 --> 25:38.790
Let's just start slow.

25:38.790 --> 25:40.120
Right, baby steps.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.620
-(beeping)
-Easy...

25:43.620 --> 25:45.250
Hee-hee-hee!

25:50.620 --> 25:53.170
-Baymax: Oh, no.
-Uggh!

25:54.290 --> 25:56.830
Hiro, your amplifier
thingie rocks!

25:56.830 --> 25:58.790
I'm more concerned
about our landing right now.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.540
Everybody OK?

26:16.540 --> 26:18.210
Baymax: There were no
major injuries.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.620
-Let's do it
again! (sighs)
-(clang)

26:22.830 --> 26:24.750
And they said
it was impossible?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.580
Baymax: It was
off the charts.

26:26.580 --> 26:28.500
Yeah, Baymax,
totally off the charts.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.960
I can't wait to see the look
on Granville's face.

26:33.460 --> 26:36.500
Feels like just yesterday
Tadashi was going
to his first open house.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.710
And now here you are.
I'm so proud of you!

26:39.710 --> 26:44.120
Thanks, Aunt Cass.
I think you're gonna
be impressed.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.380
My scan has detected Obake.

26:46.380 --> 26:48.000
-(spits)
-What's an Obake?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.880
Uh, Obake Hunt.
It's a... it's a game.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.500
I gotta go catch me
some Obakes!

26:54.500 --> 26:55.580
Baymax, let's go.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.500
(Baymax squeaking)

26:57.500 --> 27:00.080
(Hiro straining) Yaah!

27:00.080 --> 27:02.420
Good luck catching
your Obakes!

27:02.420 --> 27:05.960
Baymax: I have been running
periodic scans for Obake.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.120
He is currently located
in Night Market Square.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.790
Are you sure?
He's been using
a scan jammer.

27:11.790 --> 27:14.040
Baymax: Biometrics
and vocal analysis

27:14.040 --> 27:16.290
match the readings
from when we met Obake.

27:16.290 --> 27:18.540
Oh, his jammer
must be malfunctioning.

27:18.540 --> 27:21.290
This is our chance.
We can finally catch him.

27:21.290 --> 27:23.330
Ah, the open house.

27:23.330 --> 27:25.040
If I don't show
my final project,

27:25.040 --> 27:27.080
Professor Granville's
gonna fail me.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.880
Baymax: Tadashi...
believed you should help,

27:29.880 --> 27:31.830
even if it means
putting yourself at risk.

27:31.830 --> 27:33.790
Or putting my grade
at risk.

27:33.790 --> 27:36.750
But you're right,
it's what Tadashi would do.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.380
Obake it is.

27:48.580 --> 27:51.670
♪ I love science fairs
don't you too? ♪

27:51.670 --> 27:55.710
♪ Professor Granville, ooh ♪

27:55.710 --> 27:58.620
So glad you could
join us, Dr. Wower.

27:58.620 --> 28:00.040
(gloves squeaking)

28:00.040 --> 28:02.460
You know, Professor, you were
actually the inspiration

28:02.460 --> 28:04.620
behind my TV character.

28:05.830 --> 28:07.790
Granville: Hmm.

28:07.790 --> 28:10.080
Is that right?

28:10.080 --> 28:14.080
That's very...
flattering.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.920
-You created an electric
circuit inside the rose?
-I filled the xylem...

28:16.920 --> 28:20.830
With a conductive polymer.
Wow, Karmi, this could give
a whole new meaning to...

28:20.830 --> 28:22.500
both: "Power plants."

28:22.500 --> 28:25.620
(laughing)

28:25.620 --> 28:27.290
Ooh.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.040
Hmm-hmm...

28:37.380 --> 28:41.330
-Hey, guys, have you seen Hiro?
-Oh, he's not here yet?
He said he was gonna meet us.

28:41.330 --> 28:43.500
I'm sure he'll be here
any minute.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.420
OK, well, anyone want
a cupcake?

28:45.420 --> 28:46.500
-Awesome.
-Thanks, Aunt Cass!

28:46.500 --> 28:48.120
Fred: Clutch!

28:48.120 --> 28:51.210
Hmm, this is not gonna work...

28:51.210 --> 28:52.960
(gobbling)

28:52.960 --> 28:56.960
If Hiro keeps flaking,
he's gonna flunk out.

28:58.330 --> 28:59.750
-(whoosh)
-(thud)

29:01.290 --> 29:03.380
Baymax: Nice hideout.
Scanning.

29:05.380 --> 29:07.040
Obake is inside.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.750
We better call
the others.

29:08.750 --> 29:11.790
Obake is approaching
the rear exit.

29:11.790 --> 29:14.710
You're right,
we gotta go in now.

29:14.710 --> 29:16.420
It's hero time.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.540
Never mind. C-Come on.

29:22.540 --> 29:24.620
Wow! Honey Lemon,

29:24.620 --> 29:27.380
all the big dawgs showed up
to see your final project.

29:27.380 --> 29:29.960
Big dawgs?
No, no, don't say that.

29:29.960 --> 29:33.420
But I like big dawgs.
Go Go, who doesn't
like big dawgs?

29:33.420 --> 29:35.830
Where is Wasabi
with the wax cylinder?

29:35.830 --> 29:38.920
Excuse me. Ugh.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.580
(sighs) Sorry
it took so long.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.120
I pushed the hummingbird
to its limit.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.080
(gasp) Thank you,
Wasabi!

29:46.080 --> 29:48.500
-(pop)
-You need better hobbies.

29:48.500 --> 29:52.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final project,

29:52.000 --> 29:56.580
I am unraveling the mystery
of Lenore Shimamoto's
secret work as a scientist.

29:56.580 --> 30:00.830
I believe I have found the key.
A recording made by
Lenore Shimamoto herself!

30:00.830 --> 30:02.500
Are you sure
this is authentic?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.500
Uh-huh. It was hidden
in your lab.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.580
I believe she wanted
a future generation
to find it,

30:06.580 --> 30:08.250
and now we have.

30:08.250 --> 30:12.880
We will be the first people
to hear her speak
in over a century.

30:12.880 --> 30:16.420
Shimamoto: April 4th, 1907.
If you are listening to this,

30:16.420 --> 30:19.710
then you have proven yourself
clever enough to follow
the clues I left.

30:19.710 --> 30:22.380
Nerd power
for the win.

30:22.380 --> 30:25.290
Shimamoto: Undoubtedly,
you have uncovered the diagram
under my painting,

30:25.290 --> 30:26.540
"City Rising."

30:26.540 --> 30:28.250
I preserved it for study only.

30:28.250 --> 30:31.080
Do not let yourself be tempted
by blind ambition.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.040
To recreate my work will lead
you down a pitch-dark path.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.000
I built a machine which
I thought would create

30:37.000 --> 30:38.670
a source of unlimited power.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.710
-(sparks zapping)
-However, that's
not what happened.

30:40.710 --> 30:43.210
My experiment was
responsible for...

30:43.210 --> 30:45.500
I am responsible for
the Great Catastrophe.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.000
-(woman gasps)
-woman: What?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.920
The destruction,
the devastation.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.620
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.210
(all gasping)

31:02.880 --> 31:06.000
Hmm. You might want
to put on a happier
wax cylinder next time.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.250
Ooh, maybe one
with reggae?

31:08.250 --> 31:12.170
(electricity buzzing)

31:12.170 --> 31:15.170
Give it up, Obake.
There's nowhere to run.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.290
My dear Hiro,
why would I run

31:17.290 --> 31:19.750
when you're exactly
where I want you?

31:19.750 --> 31:22.290
A bot.
It's not the real Obake!

31:22.290 --> 31:23.580
(clanging)

31:23.580 --> 31:24.960
Baymax: Oh no.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.620
(crash)

31:26.620 --> 31:28.330
Baymax!

31:28.330 --> 31:30.580
(arms whirring)

31:30.580 --> 31:32.580
(Hiro panting)

31:36.250 --> 31:37.620
(Hiro groans)

31:37.620 --> 31:39.290
(straining)

31:39.290 --> 31:41.960
Baymax, rocket fist!

31:41.960 --> 31:43.460
(clang)

31:43.460 --> 31:45.330
-(whoosh)
-(crash)

31:47.080 --> 31:49.290
Baymax, are you OK?

31:49.290 --> 31:51.080
Baymax:
My damage is minimal.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.290
(buzzing)

31:52.290 --> 31:54.420
Thank you for playing.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.080
I don't get it, how did
the bot confuse your scanners?

31:59.080 --> 32:01.120
-Baymax: I am uncertain.
-(bot whirring)

32:01.120 --> 32:03.080
Bot: Well done, Hiro.

32:03.080 --> 32:07.210
Unfortunately for you,
I kept you busy
just long enough...

32:07.210 --> 32:10.420
Kept me busy,
from what? (gasp)

32:14.960 --> 32:16.790
Hello, Professor.

32:16.790 --> 32:19.750
Bob? Bob Aken?

32:19.750 --> 32:21.330
In the flesh.

32:21.330 --> 32:24.830
I... I haven't
seen you since...

32:24.830 --> 32:27.210
Since my little accident?

32:27.210 --> 32:31.500
What... What happened
back then...

32:31.500 --> 32:32.670
I'm sorry.

32:32.670 --> 32:34.670
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Sorry for what?

32:34.670 --> 32:36.790
You did exactly
what was best for me.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.750
What was it
you used to say?

32:38.750 --> 32:41.460
"You can't hold
back genius."

32:41.460 --> 32:43.830
A philosophy
I've come to regret.

32:43.830 --> 32:45.540
A pity.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.170
Your current protégés

32:47.170 --> 32:49.750
deserve to be afforded
the same creative freedom.

32:49.750 --> 32:54.710
After all, you made me
the man I am today.

32:54.710 --> 32:57.620
Wonderful
to see you again.

33:00.330 --> 33:02.880
Fascinating presentation,
Honey Lemon.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.580
-(Honey Lemon gasps)
-Are you guys seeing
what I'm seeing?

33:05.580 --> 33:08.040
Totally! That kid stole
my sparklers idea!

33:08.040 --> 33:10.290
(sparkler fizzing)

33:10.290 --> 33:12.380
No, there!

33:14.120 --> 33:15.420
Obake's here?

33:15.420 --> 33:17.670
Obake's here!

33:19.540 --> 33:21.880
-(splat)
-And he's not alone.

33:25.210 --> 33:28.330
-(gasp)
-Jeez, lady, didn't
your parents ever teach you

33:28.330 --> 33:31.210
it's rude to scream
at strangers?

33:31.210 --> 33:33.380
(muffled screaming)

33:33.380 --> 33:37.210
Noodle Burger Boy:
I'm back. Hello!
Can we take your order?

33:37.210 --> 33:38.880
Now it's a party.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.580
Uh-oh.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.750
-(beeping)
-All the bad
dawgs showed up.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.420
(screaming)

33:47.420 --> 33:49.750
-(crash)
-(Globby roaring)

33:49.750 --> 33:53.170
Please evacuate
in an orderly fashion!

33:54.460 --> 33:56.250
(roaring)

33:59.750 --> 34:01.750
(beeping)

34:01.750 --> 34:03.170
(buzzing)

34:05.380 --> 34:07.920
(roaring continues)

34:13.540 --> 34:16.080
(Globby snarling)

34:20.750 --> 34:22.620
Bring it on!

34:22.620 --> 34:23.920
(munching)

34:25.120 --> 34:27.460
(legs whirring)

34:27.460 --> 34:29.960
Globby: Oww!

34:29.960 --> 34:31.960
(zapping)

34:31.960 --> 34:35.210
You are terrible
at this, aren't you?

34:35.210 --> 34:37.000
Fred: Granville
security bots. Sweet!

34:37.000 --> 34:39.460
Give them some room
to do their thang!

34:39.460 --> 34:42.290
-(whoosh)
-(blade clanging)

34:45.880 --> 34:48.290
(bots clanging)

34:48.290 --> 34:50.120
"Thang"? Really?

34:53.080 --> 34:56.080
-(pop)
-Let's... dance!

34:56.080 --> 34:58.080
You've got it, mister!

34:58.080 --> 35:00.330
(dance music playing)

35:00.330 --> 35:02.460
♪ Come on, everybody

35:02.460 --> 35:05.120
♪ Do the Noodle

35:05.120 --> 35:07.710

35:07.710 --> 35:09.080

35:09.080 --> 35:11.330
-Hah!
-(blade clanging)

35:14.960 --> 35:18.750
-Ugh!
-(whoosh)

35:18.750 --> 35:21.830
Hurry, Baymax, we've
gotta get to my lab.

35:23.670 --> 35:26.170
(electricity buzzing)

35:26.170 --> 35:28.000
Scared of me?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.170
Uh, it's not you.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.670
It's everything!

35:31.670 --> 35:33.000
Hyah!

35:35.040 --> 35:37.040
-Hah!
-(blade clanging)

35:39.330 --> 35:41.460
Noodle Burger Boy:
Ho ho ho ho ho!

35:44.000 --> 35:46.500
Now serving breakfast all day!

35:48.540 --> 35:51.000
Syrup? Seriously?

35:56.380 --> 35:58.330
Fred: Honey Lemon,
toss one up, surprise me!

35:58.330 --> 35:59.960
Batter up!

36:02.330 --> 36:04.290
(thwack)

36:04.290 --> 36:07.380
Advantage: Globby.

36:07.380 --> 36:08.710
(beep beep)

36:08.710 --> 36:10.540
Still works.

36:12.540 --> 36:14.290
Feels like home.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.960
Now where, oh where...

36:19.960 --> 36:21.420
(gasp) Ah!

36:21.420 --> 36:23.210
The final piece.

36:23.210 --> 36:25.880
Put it down, Obake.
It's over.

36:25.880 --> 36:29.830
Quite the opposite.
Things are just getting started.

36:29.830 --> 36:32.000
Blast him, Baymax!

36:32.000 --> 36:34.830
-(whoosh)
-Huh?

36:36.620 --> 36:38.880
Oh, why, thanks.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.420
(remote clicks)

36:44.540 --> 36:46.920
Hiro: Come on,
he's getting away!

36:46.920 --> 36:49.620
Noodle Burger Boy:
One laser-eye special coming up!

36:49.620 --> 36:51.420
(whoosh)

36:57.250 --> 36:59.420
-(crash)
-(Hiro groans)

36:59.420 --> 37:01.830
Noodle Burger Boy:
♪ Come on, everybody

37:01.830 --> 37:03.170

37:03.170 --> 37:05.500
Obake: Please, stop!

37:05.500 --> 37:08.250
-(sighs)
-Are you guys OK?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.620
Baymax: We are
without injury.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.620
But Obake got away.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.420
Students,
is everyone all right?

37:18.420 --> 37:19.830
Fred: Ah. We're fine, Professor.

37:19.830 --> 37:21.500
-(Go Go elbows Fred)
-Ugh! I mean,

37:21.500 --> 37:23.670
complete stranger,
whom we've never met.

37:23.670 --> 37:26.170
Enough with the charade,
Mr. Frederickson.

37:26.170 --> 37:28.920
Huh? Wha...?
You know we're...?

37:28.920 --> 37:31.620
Big Hero 6?
I see all.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.500
Calm down, your secret
is safe with me.

37:48.210 --> 37:52.790
My primary concern is why
the school was attacked for
a third time this semester.

37:52.790 --> 37:55.460
This was all my fault.

37:57.500 --> 38:01.790
I disobeyed you.
I created an energy amplifier.

38:01.790 --> 38:03.710
The good news is it worked.

38:03.710 --> 38:05.330
Let me guess
the bad news.

38:05.330 --> 38:07.420
Obake has it.

38:07.420 --> 38:09.540
-Mm-hmm.
-Obake?

38:09.540 --> 38:13.040
Yeah, you know,
the creepy guy with
the night light in his face?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.880
Follow me, all of you.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.670
Obake, once my star student.

38:19.670 --> 38:22.210
I knew him as Bob Aken.

38:22.210 --> 38:26.000
He had so many ideas to make
the world a better place.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.670
I encouraged him
to explore fearlessly.

38:29.670 --> 38:35.290
Unfortunately the path he chose
led him to the energy amplifier.

38:35.290 --> 38:38.790
He was not as successful
as Mr. Hamada.

38:42.710 --> 38:46.540
The boy needed limits.
I did not provide them.

38:46.540 --> 38:48.920
It was a mistake I never
wanted to make again.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.670
However, it seems I have.

38:56.420 --> 38:59.290
Fred: His real name's Bob?

38:59.290 --> 39:01.540
(spoon stirring batter)

39:06.210 --> 39:07.500
(splash)

39:07.500 --> 39:10.790
Hiro, where
have you been?

39:10.790 --> 39:12.960
-Uh, careful.
-Ooh, are you hurt?

39:12.960 --> 39:15.500
I just got a little banged up
in all the chaos at school.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.290
I got so anxious when
I couldn't find you
at the open house.

39:18.290 --> 39:21.620
Yeah, I'm sorry for
showing up late; that must
have been really scary.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.170
I'm just glad you two
are back in one piece.

39:24.170 --> 39:26.580
Well, two pieces, because
there are two of you,

39:26.580 --> 39:28.750
but probably didn't need
to explain that.

39:31.790 --> 39:32.790
Ow!

39:37.540 --> 39:39.250
I said "ow."

39:39.250 --> 39:41.580
(Baymax whirs)

39:41.580 --> 39:46.250
Uh... alerted to my need
for medical attention?

39:46.250 --> 39:47.580
Nothing?

39:49.500 --> 39:52.080
(sighs) There must be
something wrong with... What?

39:54.420 --> 39:55.670
Baymax?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.790
Baymax, you have
to listen to me.

40:09.670 --> 40:11.500
(straining)

40:11.500 --> 40:12.790
Baymax: Do not.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.120
(thud)

40:22.120 --> 40:24.790
(Hiro straining)

40:24.790 --> 40:27.830
Baymax: Resisting will result
in further injury.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.960
(door whirring)

40:34.460 --> 40:36.620
(blades clanging)

40:41.000 --> 40:42.500
Noodle Burger Boy:
Golly, mister,

40:42.500 --> 40:45.380
I've got a Noodle Supreme
with all the fixin's.

40:45.380 --> 40:47.830
Ah, knock it off with all
the fast-food jabber.

40:47.830 --> 40:48.880
It's confusing!

40:50.960 --> 40:53.710
-Hi, Hiro.
-Trina?

40:53.710 --> 40:55.250
Y-Y-You're a...

40:55.250 --> 40:57.040
Robot. Obviously.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.420
-Hiro: Obviously.
-Trina: You never
figured it out?

40:59.420 --> 41:01.290
That's so pathetic,
it's cute.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.000
(door beeps)

41:08.380 --> 41:10.380
Hiro Hamada.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.040
Welcome!

41:13.620 --> 41:17.170
-Hiro was supposed to meet us.
-Fred: It's definitely weird.

41:17.170 --> 41:20.540
People who make elaborate
conspiracy boards are
usually pretty reliable.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.250
Obake has the magnet
from the school.

41:22.250 --> 41:24.540
Fred: And he was doing
something in the bay.

41:24.540 --> 41:28.040
What if he was turning
H2O into D2O?

41:28.040 --> 41:30.540
Heavy water.
That could be
used as fuel.

41:30.540 --> 41:32.710
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
I mean, I don't
get it, but uh-huh.

41:32.710 --> 41:36.040
Honey Lemon: We know he was
obsessed with Shimamoto.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.710
(gasp) The Great Catastrophe.

41:37.710 --> 41:40.080
He's trying to recreate
the Great Catastrophe.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.380
And he has everything he needs.

41:42.380 --> 41:45.540
(dramatic soundtrack plays)

41:45.540 --> 41:47.000
(static buzzing)

41:47.000 --> 41:49.080
Hiro: Noodle Burger Boy.

41:51.710 --> 41:52.880
(beeps)

41:52.880 --> 41:57.170
(sighs) I should have been
there, but I was...

41:57.170 --> 41:59.580
Doing vital work.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.880
For me.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.420
Obake: Hah!

42:09.420 --> 42:10.580
Lenore Shimamoto?

42:10.580 --> 42:12.170
I'm a big fan.

42:12.170 --> 42:15.250
Shimamoto built a rather
unique machine.

42:15.250 --> 42:17.210
It created a star.

42:17.210 --> 42:19.790
-Hiro: A star?
-It collapsed quickly.

42:19.790 --> 42:22.710
That would create
a giant shockwave.

42:22.710 --> 42:25.460
Wait. That's how
she caused
the Great Catastrophe.

42:25.460 --> 42:29.330
Oh, you are sharp,
but New San Fransokyo
is so much larger now,

42:29.330 --> 42:31.580
so I need a bigger bang.

42:31.580 --> 42:34.670
I improved on Shimamoto's
inadvertent discovery.

42:34.670 --> 42:37.000
It should be quite a show.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.960
Why didn't I listen
to Granville?

42:38.960 --> 42:43.080
Because, like me, you were
meant to push limits.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.580
(whoosh)

42:44.580 --> 42:47.380
But everyone will be...
Aunt Cass.

42:47.380 --> 42:50.620
I have to warn her!
Ugh! (straining)

42:50.620 --> 42:52.380
If it's any comfort,

42:52.380 --> 42:56.120
even if she left now,
she wouldn't make it
out of the city in time.

42:56.120 --> 42:59.120
Wait. He's going to destroy
San Fransokyo?

42:59.120 --> 43:02.040
-Even Joe's Diner?
-(thwack)

43:02.040 --> 43:03.920
Your breath smells
like garbage.

43:06.580 --> 43:09.540
Hiro? Hiro?
Nothing.

43:09.540 --> 43:11.620
If Baymax were here,
he could scan for him.

43:11.620 --> 43:13.380
Well, can you scan
for people, Mini-Max?

43:13.380 --> 43:15.620
Mini-Max: Sure,
within a mini-radius.

43:15.620 --> 43:17.460
Fred: How mini?

43:17.460 --> 43:19.540
This room.

43:22.290 --> 43:25.120
I do not detect
Hiro Hamada.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.620
Oh.

43:26.620 --> 43:29.540
-Mini-Max:
Asparagus spear?
-Oh!

43:29.540 --> 43:33.040
We gotta assume Obake has Hiro.
Can we track Obake?

43:33.040 --> 43:35.620
We know his machine will
output a lot of energy.

43:35.620 --> 43:37.670
And we are able to scan
for an energy surge.

43:37.670 --> 43:40.500
Let's pick up our equipment
at SFIT, get to the highest
point in the city.

43:40.500 --> 43:43.250
-Find Obake.
-And find Hiro.

43:43.250 --> 43:45.920
You will be quite safe
here with me.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.710
Two visionaries,
just hangin'.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.080
It's not about me.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.670
You're gonna hurt
millions of people.

43:51.670 --> 43:54.500
Together, we're going
to create a star.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.460
Congratulations, Hiro,
that's some final project.

43:57.460 --> 44:00.330
No! Just because you can
doesn't mean you should.

44:00.330 --> 44:02.790
Uggh! That's
Granville talking.

44:02.790 --> 44:05.580
Because Granville was right.

44:05.580 --> 44:07.170
She's been right all along.

44:07.170 --> 44:11.120
Nonsense. Do you know
why Icarus plunged
to his doom?

44:11.120 --> 44:12.540
Because he flew too high.

44:12.540 --> 44:15.880
Because he needed
better wings.

44:15.880 --> 44:19.210
We have the ability
to remake the world,

44:19.210 --> 44:22.210
starting with this city.

44:22.210 --> 44:24.540
The worthy survive.

44:27.210 --> 44:28.880
Go Go: Wasabi, step on it.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.250
Way ahead of you.
We are currently 5%
over the speed limit.

44:32.250 --> 44:35.580
-New driver.
-(tires screeching)

44:35.580 --> 44:37.210
(screaming)

44:37.210 --> 44:39.040
(console jingling)

44:39.040 --> 44:41.710
Guys, just a heads up, I get
a little car sick... (retches)

44:41.710 --> 44:44.330
-...in the back sometimes.
-(tires squealing)

44:46.380 --> 44:49.080
Why am I here?
You have my energy amplifier.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.750
What more do you want? Ugh!

44:51.750 --> 44:53.080
Obake: A student.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.580
Sorry?

44:54.580 --> 44:58.000
Granville doesn't understand
your potential, but I do.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.420
When my new city is complete,
it will be a paradise for
learning and research.

45:02.420 --> 45:05.000
I can't wait to see
what you'll accomplish,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.710
what we'll accomplish.

45:06.710 --> 45:11.790
What? You'd have to be crazy
to think I'd ever join you!

45:11.790 --> 45:13.790
You're a bit worked up
right now.

45:13.790 --> 45:14.830
I understand.

45:14.830 --> 45:16.580
Tragedy has molded us,

45:16.580 --> 45:18.580
intellect has driven us.

45:18.580 --> 45:21.750
Now we stand at the doorway
to greatness!

45:21.750 --> 45:26.580
Once it's all over and there's
nothing left to save,
you'll see things differently.

45:26.580 --> 45:29.250
No, I won't.
I'm not like you.

45:29.250 --> 45:30.580
Aren't you?

45:33.210 --> 45:35.210
(gasps)

45:35.210 --> 45:36.710
(door slams)

45:36.710 --> 45:38.790
Go. Set the wheels in motion.

45:38.790 --> 45:42.210
Noodle Burger Boy: Ooh-ooh!
An order off the secret menu.

45:42.210 --> 45:43.790
Yummy!

45:43.790 --> 45:47.080
I don't deny
my method is harsh,

45:47.080 --> 45:50.330
but winning tends
to settle any arguments.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.290
-Ugh! Ow!
-(clang)

45:56.290 --> 45:58.250
Oooh!

45:58.250 --> 46:00.460
(straining)

46:00.460 --> 46:01.920
Looking for a way out?

46:01.920 --> 46:04.420
-Hiro: Aaah! Ow!
-(thud)

46:04.420 --> 46:07.080
What are you...?
Wait. You're gonna
help me escape?

46:07.080 --> 46:11.250
Yeah. I knew Obake was crazy,
but I thought it was
a fun crazy.

46:11.250 --> 46:14.540
Plus, I don't want
to destroy the city.
All my friends live there.

46:14.540 --> 46:17.880
Felony Carl and, um...

46:17.880 --> 46:19.960
Felony Carl...

46:19.960 --> 46:22.880
That's the whole list,
isn't it?

46:22.880 --> 46:24.880
Yeah.

46:24.880 --> 46:28.040
(blades clanging)

46:28.040 --> 46:31.170
-(crash)
-Me and the kid
are breaking out.

46:31.170 --> 46:33.830
Counterproposal -- no.

46:36.670 --> 46:38.250
Globby, you OK?

46:38.250 --> 46:40.830
Yeah, it looks worse
than it feels.

46:40.830 --> 46:43.580
Let's see if we
can change that.

46:43.580 --> 46:45.170
(Hiro strains)

46:45.170 --> 46:46.750
-Aaah!
-(thud)

46:46.750 --> 46:49.170
-Glob her!
-(straining)

46:49.170 --> 46:52.830
Hah! Whose breath smells
like garbage now?

46:52.830 --> 46:55.000
Still yours.

47:04.040 --> 47:08.420
Whoa, what are you doing?
He's a bad robot now.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.080
I'll come back for you, Baymax.

47:13.420 --> 47:16.000
-There's no way out.
-Oh, isn't there?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.620
(lid clanging)

47:18.620 --> 47:20.420
-Hold your breath!
-Yaaaah!

47:25.330 --> 47:27.380
(pipe clanging)

47:35.880 --> 47:37.540
-Wait here.
-Why can't I come in?

47:37.540 --> 47:39.330
I don't have time
to explain to you.

47:39.330 --> 47:42.540
Rude.
But I get it.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.540
Hiro. You're OK.

47:46.540 --> 47:48.080
Aunt Cass!

47:48.080 --> 47:50.420
Ooh, and you're all wet.

47:50.420 --> 47:52.500
Yeah. A freak downpour.

47:52.500 --> 47:56.540
-It didn't rain here.
-Three blocks away.
Weirdest thing.

47:56.540 --> 47:58.250
There are fresh towels
in the laundry room.

47:58.250 --> 48:00.250
Ooh, we should go out
to dinner tonight, your pick.

48:00.250 --> 48:03.580
You know, celebrate the end
of your first semester.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.830
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

48:05.830 --> 48:09.080
-Love you.
-Oh, watch
the hot coffee!

48:09.080 --> 48:10.460
Cass: Hmm.

48:12.420 --> 48:14.710
-Cass: Is something--
-I gotta go.

48:14.710 --> 48:17.960
-(shoes squishing)
-Don't forget dinner tonight!

48:17.960 --> 48:21.000
Wait, you're not scared
to be up here, Wasabi?

48:21.000 --> 48:24.580
Oh, I'm quite terrified.
I'm just more afraid of
the whole city being wiped out.

48:24.580 --> 48:26.790
-Hiro: Guys,
are you there?
-all: Hiro!

48:26.790 --> 48:28.000
Where are you?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.420
Listen, Obake has
control of Baymax.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.790
He used him to capture me.

48:31.790 --> 48:33.710
I only escaped because
of Globby.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.330
I'm a good guy now!

48:35.330 --> 48:38.290
Honey Lemon: Yay, Globby.
I knew you weren't all bad.

48:38.290 --> 48:42.380
Hey. It's the tall girl.
She believed in me all along!

48:42.380 --> 48:44.330
Honey Lemon: I'm really
not that tall.

48:44.330 --> 48:46.790
(straining)

48:49.540 --> 48:53.380
The idiot glob
helped the boy escape.

48:53.380 --> 48:54.540
Bring him back!

48:56.330 --> 48:57.790
Ugh! Why bother?

48:57.790 --> 49:01.000
He needs guidance.
My guidance.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.710
(dramatic music playing)

49:03.710 --> 49:07.250
Noodle Burger! We deliver!

49:07.250 --> 49:09.170
Hello?

49:09.170 --> 49:13.540
A-hee-hee-hee-hee
hee-hee-heeeee!

49:13.540 --> 49:15.330
(machine whirring, beeping)

49:21.250 --> 49:24.000
This noodle printer's gonna
ring everybody's bell!

49:24.000 --> 49:28.380
-(beep)
-A-hee-hee-hee
hee-heeee.

49:28.380 --> 49:30.670

49:30.670 --> 49:33.500

49:35.210 --> 49:37.920

49:41.120 --> 49:43.670
-(beeping)
-Go Go: Wait, I'm
getting something.

49:43.670 --> 49:46.580
-Hiro, it's in the
Kireina Point lighthouse.
-Hiro: Copy that.

49:46.580 --> 49:49.210
-How are we going
to get there?
-Uggh! I'll go.

49:49.210 --> 49:51.880
You guys stay where you are.
Globby, go be with the others.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.750
OK, but what are you
going to do?

49:53.750 --> 49:55.250
Something I'll
probably regret.

49:55.250 --> 49:58.540
(screaming) I miss Baymax!

50:00.710 --> 50:01.880
Sorry. Ha ha.

50:03.420 --> 50:05.540
(sparks zapping)

50:07.380 --> 50:09.420
-Oh, no!

Oh! That was so close.

51:06.620 --> 51:09.620
(power zapping)

51:09.620 --> 51:11.120
(beeping)

51:13.830 --> 51:15.790
Guys, I did it!

51:15.790 --> 51:18.380
Fred: Oh, yeah!
Up high, Hiro.

51:18.380 --> 51:20.250
-Wow!
-Great job, Hiro.

51:20.250 --> 51:22.960
-Now we get Obake.
-Uh, what's that?

51:26.420 --> 51:27.790
(boom)

51:29.290 --> 51:31.960
The reaction became
self-sustaining.

51:31.960 --> 51:33.080
Obake did it.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.790
I was too late.

51:34.790 --> 51:38.000
-What do we do?
-Evacuate as many
as we can.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.250
Not enough time.
We have to stop that shockwave.

51:40.250 --> 51:42.460
There's no way
to stop something
with that much force.

51:42.460 --> 51:45.080
Yes there is: with an equal
and opposite force.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.750
But we'd need
something enormous.

51:46.750 --> 51:49.080
Enormous? We got that.

51:54.790 --> 51:58.380
If we use the amplifier to make
the Kaiju super-jump
into the bay...

51:58.380 --> 52:01.170
The giant wave
could counteract
the star's shockwave.

52:01.170 --> 52:06.000
Guys, the city needs us.
We were the ones who decided
to be superheroes.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.210
Now's the time to be super.

52:09.210 --> 52:12.380
Hiro's right.
We can do this.

52:12.380 --> 52:14.290
(tires squeal)

52:16.500 --> 52:20.460
Hiro: Globby, Honey Lemon,
you guys need to create
a breaker to protect Fishtown.

52:20.460 --> 52:23.580
Wasabi, Go Go, keep people
away from the shoreline.

52:23.580 --> 52:25.420
(child crying)

52:31.710 --> 52:33.880
(Globby straining)

52:39.710 --> 52:41.250
You're very brave, Globby.
Good luck.

52:41.250 --> 52:44.670
If I don't make it,
tell Felony Carl he was my...

52:44.670 --> 52:46.080
he was my whole list.

52:46.080 --> 52:49.380
I don't know what that means,
but I promise.

52:52.290 --> 52:54.380
(rumbling)

53:00.420 --> 53:01.920
(beep)

53:01.920 --> 53:05.040

53:09.960 --> 53:11.920
-Aaah! Uggh!
-(blade clangs)

53:11.920 --> 53:14.500
Bring me the boy
and you'll be spared.

53:14.500 --> 53:15.920
Ugh!

53:15.920 --> 53:18.120
Stay with the bus
and protect the kids.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.580
I'll take care of Momakase.

53:19.580 --> 53:22.830
We both know you're
no match for me.

53:22.830 --> 53:27.500
Actually, since we last met,
I watched some instructional
fencing videos online...

53:27.500 --> 53:31.170
woman: Use the parry four
to block an attack
aimed at your right side.

53:31.170 --> 53:33.750
...so bring it.

53:33.750 --> 53:35.500
Hah!

53:35.500 --> 53:37.080
(both straining)

53:47.880 --> 53:49.080
You ready for this?

53:49.080 --> 53:51.380
Yes, I am.

53:51.380 --> 53:53.460
Mini-Max: No, you're not!

53:53.460 --> 53:56.750
Not without Mini-Max
at your side!

53:56.750 --> 53:59.620
Ho-ho! Suh-weet
dramatic entrance,
Mini-Max.

53:59.620 --> 54:02.420
-You're getting
the hang of that.
-(Hiro straining)

54:06.620 --> 54:08.790
When that star implodes,
we jump.

54:08.790 --> 54:11.460
-(whoosh)
-(both straining)

54:15.040 --> 54:16.920
Ahh! My dreads!

54:16.920 --> 54:18.500
(blade clangs)

54:24.790 --> 54:27.290
-(clang)
-Whoa!

54:27.290 --> 54:28.290
Uggh!

54:29.920 --> 54:32.290
-Uggh!
-Yes!

54:32.290 --> 54:34.040
(passengers cheering)

54:36.170 --> 54:38.380
I got bored waiting on the bus.

54:38.380 --> 54:40.540
(Obake keying)

54:40.540 --> 54:44.210
Noodle Burger Boy: Wow, mister,
your plan seems to be working.

54:44.210 --> 54:46.750
-Seems?
-I bet a song will...

54:46.750 --> 54:49.670
-(Burger Boy powers down)
-Perhaps you'll be
better company.

54:49.670 --> 54:51.500
(Baymax whirring)

54:51.500 --> 54:55.000
Baymax: Hello. I am Baymax.
I am unable to move.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.710
Well, I can't have you
running off,

54:56.710 --> 54:58.380
but I thought a chat
might be nice.

54:59.830 --> 55:01.830
I'll be remembered forever

55:01.830 --> 55:04.210
because of what's
about to happen.

55:04.210 --> 55:05.750
Impressive, isn't it?

55:05.750 --> 55:07.790
Baymax: You are in need
of medical care.

55:07.790 --> 55:11.000
Oh, this? A souvenir
from a childhood mishap.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.670
Baymax: The damage is
significant, and growing.

55:13.670 --> 55:17.210
It is affecting your
temporoparietal junction.

55:17.210 --> 55:21.380
The part of the brain that
allows one to tell right
from wrong, I know.

55:21.380 --> 55:23.040
Baymax: Your condition
is treatable.

55:23.040 --> 55:26.710
(laughs) Why would I want
to do that?

55:26.710 --> 55:29.120
It's been quite liberating.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.880
(Baymax whirs)

55:30.880 --> 55:32.040
Fred: Is it time now?

55:32.040 --> 55:33.880
Now? How about now?

55:33.880 --> 55:36.210
Ooh, I know. Now!

55:37.750 --> 55:40.040
-(whoosh)
-Now!

55:40.040 --> 55:41.960
-(beeping)
-(sparking)

55:44.040 --> 55:46.040
It's Kaiju cannonball time.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.210
(whirring)

55:51.420 --> 55:53.040
(whoosh)

55:56.080 --> 56:00.710
I just want you to know that
being a superhero with you
has been an honor.

56:00.710 --> 56:03.380
-You guys are the best.
-I'm proud of
what we've done.

56:03.380 --> 56:06.170
-Same.
-Mini-Max:
Inspiring words.

56:06.170 --> 56:08.830
Guys, I know I've made
some mistakes, but--

56:08.830 --> 56:10.330
We've all made mistakes.

56:10.330 --> 56:12.330
But we get through it
because we're a team.

56:12.330 --> 56:14.120
(tires squealing)

56:19.420 --> 56:22.120
Let's make
some waves.

56:30.040 --> 56:31.290

56:33.830 --> 56:35.330
(star rumbling)

56:40.460 --> 56:41.880

56:51.460 --> 56:54.960

-(whoosh)

57:02.040 --> 57:03.380

57:03.380 --> 57:07.790
-(star rumbling)
-(wind whistling)

57:17.250 --> 57:21.040
(whoosh)

57:21.040 --> 57:23.620
I'm questioning
all my life choices.

57:23.620 --> 57:25.170
You got this,
Globby!

57:29.670 --> 57:32.080
(water roaring)

57:32.080 --> 57:34.330
(straining)

57:34.330 --> 57:36.330
(Globby straining, groaning)

57:45.000 --> 57:47.710
(chuckles) It worked!

57:47.710 --> 57:49.670
Oh! I knew you could do it.

57:49.670 --> 57:50.920
-(crowd cheering)
-Wasabi: Yes!

57:50.920 --> 57:54.380
(cats mewing)

57:54.380 --> 57:56.040
(rocks clattering)

57:56.040 --> 57:58.170
Hiro. How could he possibly...?

57:58.170 --> 58:00.830
Baymax: Hiro is clever
and resourceful.

58:00.830 --> 58:03.620
(static buzzing)

58:03.620 --> 58:07.040
My new city.
My dream.

58:07.040 --> 58:10.790
They still remember Shimamoto,
they revere her.

58:10.790 --> 58:13.380
Baymax: My scan indicates
that this structure

58:13.380 --> 58:15.080
-is sustaining damage.
-(thud)

58:15.080 --> 58:17.420
This wouldn't have mattered,
I would've lived forever,

58:17.420 --> 58:21.830
the man who remade the city
into something perfect.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.250
(Baymax whirring)

58:32.250 --> 58:34.880
There, there.

58:34.880 --> 58:37.080
-You should go.
-You are in danger.

58:37.080 --> 58:40.920
-Yes, I'm aware of that!
-Do I have your permission
to help you?

58:40.920 --> 58:44.040
Go to him. Go to Hiro!

58:44.040 --> 58:46.620
(equipment clattering)

58:46.620 --> 58:50.330
Tell him I still think we would
have done great things together.

58:50.330 --> 58:52.920
Baymax: I am a personal
healthcare companion.

58:52.920 --> 58:57.170
I cannot leave until you say you
are satisfied with your care.

58:58.960 --> 59:02.080
Obake: I am satisfied
with my care.

59:04.830 --> 59:07.080
(feet pounding)

59:08.500 --> 59:10.330
(rocks clattering)

59:10.330 --> 59:12.670
(equipment shattering)

59:12.670 --> 59:15.210
(footsteps pounding)

59:22.120 --> 59:24.750
(straining)

59:26.580 --> 59:29.830
(gasp) Everything's
jammed!

59:32.960 --> 59:34.790
(clang)

59:37.120 --> 59:38.540
(Hiro gasps)

59:38.540 --> 59:40.790
Baymax: I was alerted
to your need for--

59:40.790 --> 59:43.290
-Baymax!
-Hiro.

59:44.830 --> 59:47.210
Mini-Max: We are still sinking.

59:47.210 --> 59:49.580
-Baymax: It is time to go.
-(water bubbling)

59:54.500 --> 59:56.120
There they are!

59:57.790 --> 59:59.670
-(whoosh)
-(laughing)

59:59.670 --> 1:00:01.960
Honey Lemon: The guys are OK!

1:00:04.620 --> 1:00:07.120
-Huh?
-Go Go: Nice
job, genius.

1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:10.920
-You helped the bad
guy create a star.
-I know.

1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:12.250
You also saved the city.

1:00:12.250 --> 1:00:14.880
Thanks, but none of this
would have happened

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.830
if I hadn't been
so... me.

1:00:16.830 --> 1:00:21.670
Baymax: Tadashi was right.
You are a good kid.

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:24.210
Huh?

1:00:24.210 --> 1:00:26.460
It was a countdown
to catastrophe,

1:00:26.460 --> 1:00:30.330
but thanks once again
to Big Hero 6, I am fine.

1:00:30.330 --> 1:00:33.250
And the city is, too.

1:00:33.250 --> 1:00:35.670
Which is what I was
worried about.

1:00:35.670 --> 1:00:37.210
Who are these mysterious
do-gooders?

1:00:37.210 --> 1:00:38.380
(meow)

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.170
-Hey, Cass.
-(meow)

1:00:44.170 --> 1:00:46.460
Hiro, you're safe!
Where were you?

1:00:46.460 --> 1:00:49.620
There was a storm
and this huge wave thingie,

1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:51.380
-and the city
almost--
-I saw it.

1:00:51.380 --> 1:00:52.710
You saw it?

1:00:52.710 --> 1:00:54.920
I, uh, saw it
on my phone,

1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:57.290
while I was safely
hiding at school.

1:00:57.290 --> 1:01:00.620
Also, my phone battery
died at school.

1:01:00.620 --> 1:01:03.290
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1:01:03.290 --> 1:01:04.880
Baymax: Yes. We...

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:07.380
Are starving. Well?

1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:09.710
I-I'm starving.

1:01:09.710 --> 1:01:11.920
Baymax: Starvation
is not imminent.

1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:14.080
It would take weeks without
caloric sustenance to--

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:16.620
OK, let's have
some breakfast.

1:01:16.620 --> 1:01:18.790
Thanks, Aunt Cass.
It's good to be home.

1:01:18.790 --> 1:01:19.920
Cass: Oh!

1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:21.580
(keying)

1:01:21.580 --> 1:01:24.210
-(knock on door)
-Come in.

1:01:27.250 --> 1:01:29.500
So, about my final
project, I'm...

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:33.210
Getting an A,
for showing ingenuity

1:01:33.210 --> 1:01:35.330
and for saving the city.

1:01:38.420 --> 1:01:40.750
Thank you,
Professor Granville.

1:01:40.750 --> 1:01:42.500
Uh, for everything.

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:45.040
For trying to teach me
about limits.

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:46.830
I think I get it now.

1:01:46.830 --> 1:01:50.790
It's a lesson I've had
to relearn a few times
myself, Mr. Hamada.

1:01:50.790 --> 1:01:53.500
Everyone makes mistakes.

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.080
But don't get
too comfortable.

1:01:57.080 --> 1:01:59.920
Next semester will be even
more of a challenge.

1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:01.460
I hope you can handle it.

1:02:06.580 --> 1:02:12.250
Hiro... do you know
what happened to him?

1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:19.380
Baymax: I do not detect
Aken comma Bob.

1:02:19.380 --> 1:02:22.290
Hiro: He couldn't
have survived this.
It's impossible.

1:02:22.290 --> 1:02:26.120
Baymax: As you have said,
nothing is impossible.
