Hey, I'm sorry.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.234
It's a parent thing.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.069

13:59.089 --> 14:00.173

It was just a couple of Glenn's friends.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.884
He's just not a good influence.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.053
You never did things like this
before you started seeing him.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.721
Don't I get any credit for calling Tami

14:06.805 --> 14:08.848

drive me home?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.143

14:12.227 --> 14:14.396
-You're making this worse.
-That's why I left, Dad.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.481
I didn't want to be there.

But, I guess, next time,
I won't try and do the responsible thing.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.194
Okay.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.700
I'm not gonna say
you can't see Glenn anymore.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.453
But you're grounded.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.997
Three weeks.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.873
That's the rest of summer break.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.834
If you hadn't called Tami,
it would've been more.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.677
I wish you'd called me.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.267
DR.-
It's called a chordoma.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.728
It's a bone tumor
at the base of the skull.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.523
Slow-growing but malignant.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.817
Probably been there for years.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.005
I'm gonna sit.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.096
Uh, so what do we do?

15:31.097 --> 15:34.142
The only effective treatment is surgery
followed by radiation.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.436
The lucky version of the tumor

15:36.519 --> 15:40.940
would have allowed us to do
an endoscopic endonasal procedure.

15:41.024 --> 15:45.487
But we need to do a craniotomy
for a total resection.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.323
Because of the size
and placement of the tumor,

15:48.406 --> 15:50.158
surgery is complicated.

15:50.241 --> 15:54.329
This one would involve
proximity to the brain stem,

15:54.412 --> 15:58.541
and... I hate to have
to tell you this, but...

15:58.625 --> 16:02.087
there is a large chance
you don't survive the surgery.

20 percent?

16:13.682 --> 16:16.559
Ab-About a 20% chance
we're able to remove it all

16:16.643 --> 16:20.480
with no complications
that lead to brain stem damage or death.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.743
And if I don't have the surgery?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.455

57:04.338 --> 57:06.257
the biggest bear hug
of your life right now,

57:06.340 --> 57:08.634
I'm gonna cut off your arms
and wrap them around myself

57:08.717 --> 57:10.636
in a very sad and pathetic way.

57:10.719 --> 57:12.388
-Get over here.
-How the hell are you, Guy?

57:12.471 --> 57:14.306
Oh, forget me.

57:14.390 --> 57:15.599
Wally! Oh!

57:15.683 --> 57:16.892
I barely recognize you without those...

57:16.976 --> 57:19.728
Oh, God, please don't say bangs.

57:19.812 --> 57:21.355
-Cute Beetlejuice bangs.
-They were Dad's fault.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.357
But, you know,
they actually weren't as bad

57:23.440 --> 57:25.442
-as his frosted tips.
-Yeah, well, see,

57:25.526 --> 57:28.195
I'm still in therapy
for the year that my mother

57:28.279 --> 57:29.363
-let me grow a rat tail.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.532
Um, what's a rat tail again?

57:31.615 --> 57:33.951
God, we're so old.

57:34.994 --> 57:37.413
-Right?
-What?

57:37.496 --> 57:40.666
Wow, you used to wait a little longer
before tuning me out.

57:40.749 --> 57:42.334
-No, I'm sorry.

57:42.418 --> 57:43.460
It's a lot to take in.

57:43.544 --> 57:45.754
Right. Well, come and meet Samuel.

57:45.838 --> 57:48.340
I've definitely just left him alone
at a reunion

57:48.424 --> 57:50.176
where he knows absolutely no one.

57:50.259 --> 57:52.261
Join the club.

57:54.805 --> 57:56.432
This DJ is awful.

57:56.515 --> 57:59.143
When in the history of banquet halls
has a DJ ever been good?

57:59.226 --> 58:01.145
He doesn't have to be this bad.

58:01.228 --> 58:02.521
-- You're dancing?
-- Well, I'm-a always dance

58:02.605 --> 58:04.190
regardless of the quality of the music.

58:04.273 --> 58:06.108
I listen to my own playlist in my head.

58:06.192 --> 58:07.902
Mm.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.320
Park.

58:09.403 --> 58:11.697
Why aren't you up there
reliving your glory days?

58:11.780 --> 58:13.782
-What glory days?
-- Max used to be

58:13.866 --> 58:15.326
one of the broodiest singers
this side of the Mississippi.

58:15.409 --> 58:16.952
Aren't we on the Mississippi?

58:17.036 --> 58:19.371
We don't need to talk about this, okay?

58:19.455 --> 58:20.456
Yes, we do.

58:20.539 --> 58:23.751
I so wanted him to go pro
so I could make a career out of,

58:23.834 --> 58:25.878
-"Oh, no, I'm with the band, so..."

58:25.961 --> 58:28.005
-Were you really that good?
-- Oh, yes.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.965
I mean, girls in bars took their tops off.

58:30.049 --> 58:31.675
What?

58:31.759 --> 58:33.093
To be clear, it's New Orleans.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.512
Girls take their tops off
when a garbage truck goes by.

58:35.596 --> 58:38.432
-Uh, I'll be right back.
-Cool.

58:40.142 --> 58:41.810
We'll just stay here.

58:53.113 --> 58:54.365
Hi. This is Jane.

58:54.448 --> 58:56.700
-This is my wife Jane.
-Hi.

58:56.784 --> 58:58.661
H-Hold on.

58:58.744 --> 59:00.955
Excuse me.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.206
Max.

59:08.420 --> 59:09.588
Dale.

59:13.050 --> 59:15.469
Oh. Okay.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.638
-Great to see you, man.

59:17.721 --> 59:19.765
Yeah. Did you get my messages?

59:19.848 --> 59:21.684
No. Did you call me?

59:21.767 --> 59:23.727
Facebook. I don't have your phone number.

59:23.811 --> 59:24.979
I never check my DMs.

59:25.062 --> 59:27.690
It's just full of people
trying to sell me shit.

59:27.773 --> 59:29.566
Hmm.

59:30.818 --> 59:32.611
So, uh...

59:34.446 --> 59:35.948
...how's it going?

59:37.074 --> 59:39.159
Uh, I haven't, I haven't seen you
probably since...

59:39.243 --> 59:41.578
Since Nicole left me.

59:42.621 --> 59:43.789
-Uh...
-Where is she?

59:43.872 --> 59:45.666
Is she here?

59:46.959 --> 59:49.169
Oh, wow, I-I just assumed you knew.

59:49.253 --> 59:51.171
Knew what?

59:51.255 --> 59:53.841
I'm here with, uh...

59:53.924 --> 59:56.218
wife two, uh, Jane.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.596
Let me buy you a drink.

1:00:01.181 --> 1:00:02.599
It's an open bar.

1:00:02.683 --> 1:00:03.726
Okay.

1:00:03.809 --> 1:00:05.686
Maybe I can...

1:00:05.769 --> 1:00:07.813
get you a free drink.

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:09.982
-- He's cute. I get it.
-- Mm-hmm.

1:00:10.065 --> 1:00:12.359
I can see his confidence
even through the phone, child.

1:00:12.443 --> 1:00:14.570
So why would I try to kiss another guy?

1:00:14.653 --> 1:00:17.072
-Alcohol?

1:00:17.156 --> 1:00:19.325
Alcohol is always the answer
to that question.

1:00:19.408 --> 1:00:21.118
-Don't worry.

1:00:21.201 --> 1:00:23.579
Everyone always makes dumb decisions
when they're drunk.

1:00:23.662 --> 1:00:24.830
-I don't.
-I mean...

1:00:24.913 --> 1:00:26.749
-What? You don't?

1:00:28.167 --> 1:00:29.543
We met at a bar.

1:00:29.626 --> 1:00:30.919
Yeah, that was not a dumb decision.

1:00:31.003 --> 1:00:33.464
Who's that guy my dad's with?

1:00:33.547 --> 1:00:38.177
Uh... that would be Dale the douchebag.

1:00:38.260 --> 1:00:39.261
Huh.

1:00:42.056 --> 1:00:43.807
So what happened with Nicole?

1:00:44.808 --> 1:00:46.727
That's a really beautiful story.

1:00:46.810 --> 1:00:48.312
We got divorced.

1:00:48.395 --> 1:00:49.646
A few years ago now.

1:00:49.730 --> 1:00:51.148
Thought you were soul mates.

1:00:51.231 --> 1:00:54.610
We were soul mates for a little while.

1:00:55.903 --> 1:00:58.864
And then, uh, she left me, too.

1:00:58.947 --> 1:01:01.492
I, uh...

1:01:01.575 --> 1:01:03.285
I've thought about you, actually.

1:01:03.369 --> 1:01:05.537
And I, um...

1:01:06.705 --> 1:01:08.207
I really regret it.

1:01:08.290 --> 1:01:09.875
All of that.

1:01:10.959 --> 1:01:13.087
We're in the same boat, Max.

1:01:13.170 --> 1:01:16.173
And I know it's 15 years too late,
but I'm sorry.

1:01:17.341 --> 1:01:19.802
-Did you have kids?
-No. Ugh.

1:01:19.885 --> 1:01:22.096
Then our boats weren't even
in the same fucking marina.

1:01:22.179 --> 1:01:23.222
How is Wally?

1:01:23.305 --> 1:01:24.765
Don't do that. Don't do that.

1:01:24.848 --> 1:01:26.016
Okay.

1:01:26.100 --> 1:01:27.476
I was just trying to reconnect with you.

1:01:27.559 --> 1:01:30.145
All right, where's Nicole now?

1:01:30.229 --> 1:01:34.733

uh, near Tampa.

he was your best friend?

we were coming to see her?

1:03:50.869 --> 1:03:52.955
I didn't know what she'd be like.

1:03:53.038 --> 1:03:56.833
But I guess we're both gonna find out
if we're heading to Florida.

1:03:57.876 --> 1:03:59.753
Does she want to meet me?

I could find online.

1:04:12.683 --> 1:04:14.309
You have?

1:04:14.393 --> 1:04:16.395
They're mostly white ladies.

1:04:17.312 --> 1:04:21.733
She's going by her stage name:
Nicole Genevieve.

1:04:22.734 --> 1:04:24.111
She's an actress?

1:04:24.194 --> 1:04:25.654
She was gonna be.

1:04:25.737 --> 1:04:29.950
She said L.A. was, uh, too hard.

1:04:30.033 --> 1:04:31.618
That's what took her to New York.

1:04:31.702 --> 1:04:33.662
That and Dale.

1:04:33.745 --> 1:04:35.289
Don't hold Dale against her, okay?

1:04:35.372 --> 1:04:37.207
Her leaving was...

1:04:37.291 --> 1:04:39.126
my fault.

Wait. What?

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:43.338
What do you mean?

1:04:43.422 --> 1:04:45.340
Not... not entirely.

1:04:45.424 --> 1:04:47.759
It is complicated.

1:04:47.843 --> 1:04:49.052
What's complicated?

1:04:49.136 --> 1:04:51.054
You-you forced her
to hook up with another guy?

1:04:51.138 --> 1:04:52.472
No, um...

1:04:52.556 --> 1:04:54.266
Dad, she's the one who cheated.

1:05:02.983 --> 1:05:04.192
What?

1:05:07.529 --> 1:05:09.156
I cheated first.

What?

1:05:44.316 --> 1:05:46.652
Why'd you do it?

1:05:46.735 --> 1:05:49.946
And I don't want some bullshit answer.

1:05:50.030 --> 1:05:52.741
I don't have a reason
that's gonna make it better.

1:05:55.243 --> 1:05:56.870
We had a fight.

1:05:58.830 --> 1:06:00.832
We had a lot of fights.

1:06:03.835 --> 1:06:06.838
I went out and...

1:06:06.922 --> 1:06:08.882
I got drunk.

1:06:10.217 --> 1:06:11.426
And that was that.

1:06:15.722 --> 1:06:17.808

I figured I'd get your voice mail.

1:07:28.128 --> 1:07:30.088
Mm, yeah. Summer school grades are due,

1:09:47.017 --> 1:09:48.810
Last night, Guy kept talking about

1:09:48.894 --> 1:09:50.604
how he thought you were gonna end
up a rock star.

1:09:50.687 --> 1:09:52.814
I've never even heard you sing.

1:09:52.898 --> 1:09:54.399
What are you talking about?
Of course you have.

1:09:54.482 --> 1:09:56.610
I don't mean to the radio
or when you used to sing

1:09:56.693 --> 1:10:00.113
"My Wally Lies Over the Ocean"
to put me to sleep.

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:01.740
I told you I used to play guitar.

1:10:01.823 --> 1:10:02.866
And some drums.

1:10:02.949 --> 1:10:04.659
Yeah, but I assumed you meant, like,

1:10:04.743 --> 1:10:06.995
you took lessons or something
since you don't own a guitar.

1:10:07.078 --> 1:10:09.164

1:10:09.247 --> 1:10:11.166
That's sad, Dad.

1:10:11.249 --> 1:10:14.920
For a while, I was...

1:10:15.003 --> 1:10:17.047
really serious about music.

1:10:18.715 --> 1:10:20.800
I thought I could make a living off of it.

1:10:21.801 --> 1:10:23.887
Until one day, you woke up thinking,

1:10:23.970 --> 1:10:27.182
"My life would be so much better
if I got a job where I wore loafers."

1:10:27.265 --> 1:10:28.850
I do not wear loafers.

1:10:28.934 --> 1:10:31.227

These have laces.

1:10:32.854 --> 1:10:34.230
Oh.

1:10:34.314 --> 1:10:36.816
Loafers don't have laces.
That's what makes them loafers.

1:10:38.735 --> 1:10:41.529
Look, 99% of people who want
to make a living doing music or art

1:10:41.613 --> 1:10:43.949
are never gonna be successful,
and that's just facts.

1:10:44.032 --> 1:10:45.241
So you just gave it up?

1:10:45.325 --> 1:10:47.243
I could've struggled for years,

1:10:47.327 --> 1:10:49.537
could've given up everything
and still never made it.

1:10:49.621 --> 1:10:51.748

1:22:36.619 --> 1:22:38.996
She's not getting her floors redone.

1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:41.040
Okay? So, ei-either she's a crackhead

1:22:41.123 --> 1:22:43.084
and-and you just didn't want me
to meet her

1:22:43.167 --> 1:22:45.169
or she doesn't want to meet me.

1:22:49.131 --> 1:22:50.800
She has a baby.

1:22:52.677 --> 1:22:56.305
She said her life is too complicated
to meet you right now. Come here.

1:22:56.389 --> 1:22:57.932
Stop. Stop telling me things
are complicated.

1:22:58.015 --> 1:22:59.433
It means nothing.

1:22:59.517 --> 1:23:00.768
Wally, we got to talk about this.

1:23:00.851 --> 1:23:02.311
What is wrong with you?!

1:23:02.395 --> 1:23:03.604
You brought us to a freaking nude beach?!

1:23:03.688 --> 1:23:05.856
- I didn't know it was a nude beach.
I just GPS'd the closest one.

1:23:05.940 --> 1:23:07.858
'Cause I needed to be further scarred
by this day.

1:23:07.942 --> 1:23:09.235
You can never tell anyone
that I brought you here, okay?

1:23:09.318 --> 1:23:11.070
I would die
before I tell anyone about this!

1:23:13.489 --> 1:23:15.408
Dad, stop!

1:23:15.491 --> 1:23:16.659
Stop touching me!

1:23:16.742 --> 1:23:18.035
Wally, calm down! Calm down!

1:23:18.119 --> 1:23:19.995
No, I-I don't want to calm down!

1:23:20.079 --> 1:23:22.998
Did you think I wouldn't figure out
that she didn't want to meet me?

1:23:23.082 --> 1:23:24.667
Or w-were you gonna lie to me
again tomorrow

1:23:24.750 --> 1:23:26.752
and the next day and the next day?

1:23:26.836 --> 1:23:28.462
Clearly I didn't have a plan, okay?

1:23:28.546 --> 1:23:30.214
I just didn't want to see you sad.

1:23:30.297 --> 1:23:33.175
You know what?
That worked out perfect, Dad.

1:23:35.970 --> 1:23:38.180
What's her replacement kid's name?

1:23:38.264 --> 1:23:39.473
She's not a replacement.

1:23:39.557 --> 1:23:41.559
Maybe you don't know
the meaning of the word.

1:23:43.978 --> 1:23:46.021
Elizabeth.

1:23:47.064 --> 1:23:48.691
Dumbest name ever.

1:23:48.774 --> 1:23:51.277
She was just overwhelmed.

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:53.320
Sweetheart, I know she'll come around.

1:23:55.448 --> 1:23:56.449
Wally.

1:23:57.825 --> 1:23:59.785
Wally. Wally?

1:23:59.869 --> 1:24:01.871
♪ ♪

1:24:28.981 --> 1:24:31.108
Wally? Can I come in?

1:24:33.027 --> 1:24:35.279
-Hey, Wall...

1:24:36.489 --> 1:24:37.823
-I'm ready to go home now.

1:24:37.907 --> 1:24:40.951
Hey. We're not leaving. Come on.

1:24:41.035 --> 1:24:42.578
I'm not gonna stay somewhere
where there's nothing for me.

1:24:42.661 --> 1:24:43.913
Listen, I'm not gonna drag you.

1:24:43.996 --> 1:24:46.040
You've dragged me this whole time!

1:24:46.123 --> 1:24:47.124
Wally!

1:24:47.208 --> 1:24:48.417
We're going home!

1:24:48.501 --> 1:24:51.003
No, we're not leaving until you meet her!

1:24:51.086 --> 1:24:53.088
I know deep down she wants to see you.

1:24:53.172 --> 1:24:54.548
Then why didn't she ever try to?

1:24:54.632 --> 1:24:56.926
God, I wish you never put this stupid idea
in my head!

1:24:57.009 --> 1:24:59.553
You should've just let me keep
this fantasy version of her

1:24:59.637 --> 1:25:02.890
that somewhere out there
was a woman who regretted abandoning me

1:25:02.973 --> 1:25:04.683
and wished she could have me back.

1:25:04.767 --> 1:25:06.227
But you didn't.

1:25:06.310 --> 1:25:07.436
You ruined everything.

1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:08.771
I want to go home.

1:25:10.231 --> 1:25:12.316
-You have to meet her.
-I thought I wasn't

1:25:12.399 --> 1:25:14.735
supposed to want someone
who doesn't want me back.

1:25:14.819 --> 1:25:16.445
So this is, this is different. Uh...

1:25:16.529 --> 1:25:17.947
Are you still in love with her?

1:25:21.659 --> 1:25:23.077
Not even close.

1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:25.454
So why are you doing this to me?

1:25:40.177 --> 1:25:41.720
Um...

1:25:51.605 --> 1:25:53.941
I have a tumor

1:25:54.024 --> 1:25:56.610
in my head

1:25:56.694 --> 1:26:00.030
that's giving me less than a year.

1:26:02.449 --> 1:26:08.205
If I let them operate to try to remove it,

1:26:08.289 --> 1:26:10.791
uh, they could kill me on the table.

1:26:12.042 --> 1:26:13.627
So I-I can't do that.

1:26:15.170 --> 1:26:19.425
I have to spend this year
fixing things for you while I still can.

1:26:20.759 --> 1:26:22.511
-Wally.

1:26:22.595 --> 1:26:25.431
-Wally. Wally.

1:26:25.514 --> 1:26:27.057
Wally?!

1:26:28.976 --> 1:26:31.186
Wally. Come on.

1:26:35.941 --> 1:26:37.651
-Wally?

1:26:37.735 --> 1:26:40.362
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, yes, everything is fine.

1:26:41.655 --> 1:26:43.490
-Hey!

1:26:43.574 --> 1:26:45.034
Turn the car off!

1:26:45.117 --> 1:26:46.118
-Turn the car off!

1:26:46.201 --> 1:26:47.453
No! Move!

1:26:54.251 --> 1:26:55.544
Hey, come on.

1:26:55.628 --> 1:26:57.421
Wally, let's talk about this.

1:27:00.424 --> 1:27:02.343
I know this sucks.

1:27:02.426 --> 1:27:04.511
-I get it, okay?
-Oh, you get it?

1:27:04.595 --> 1:27:06.555
-Whoa! Whoa! Slow down!

1:27:06.639 --> 1:27:08.223
-Put your belt on!

1:27:08.307 --> 1:27:10.351
-Ugh, get off! Stop!
-Put your belt on!

1:27:10.434 --> 1:27:12.102
-Slow down. Shit.

1:27:13.646 --> 1:27:16.023
Listen, I understand you're upset, okay?

1:27:16.106 --> 1:27:17.316
I'm obviously upset, too.

1:27:17.399 --> 1:27:18.692
-We need to talk about it.
-Oh, you don't want

1:27:18.776 --> 1:27:20.402
to congratulate me on my perfect merge?

1:27:20.486 --> 1:27:21.779
No! I want you to stop driving!

1:27:21.862 --> 1:27:23.030
I didn't make you come with me!

1:27:23.113 --> 1:27:24.990
-You are welcome to get out!

1:27:26.742 --> 1:27:28.827
This car can't handle any faster!

1:27:28.911 --> 1:27:30.829
Maybe you shouldn't have
an elderly car, then.

1:27:32.373 --> 1:27:33.916
Okay.

1:27:33.999 --> 1:27:35.876
All right, we're gonna get arrested.

1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:37.670
That's good. That's what I need right now.

1:27:41.423 --> 1:27:43.634
How many times
do I have to tell you to stop?!

1:27:43.717 --> 1:27:45.678
I don't know. I guess we'll see.

1:27:45.761 --> 1:27:47.596
What point is this proving?!

1:27:49.014 --> 1:27:50.516
Jesus!

1:27:50.599 --> 1:27:52.101
Wally! Stop!

1:27:55.312 --> 1:27:56.855
You could've killed somebody!

1:27:59.066 --> 1:28:01.527
-- You all right?
-Wally?

1:28:01.610 --> 1:28:03.028
Hey, where-where's she going?

1:28:03.112 --> 1:28:04.655
Wally!

1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:08.701
I'm sorry. I-I'll be right back!

1:28:08.784 --> 1:28:10.911
Sorry!

1:28:10.995 --> 1:28:12.538
Wally!

1:28:12.621 --> 1:28:15.082
Stop! Stop!

1:28:15.165 --> 1:28:16.500
Hey!

1:28:17.626 --> 1:28:19.461
Hey!

1:28:19.545 --> 1:28:21.630
Hey. What the hell was that?!

1:28:21.714 --> 1:28:24.383
-I hate you. I hate you.
-For what?

1:28:24.466 --> 1:28:26.844
You find out that you're...

1:28:26.927 --> 1:28:28.929
that you have a tumor,
and instead of telling me,

1:28:29.013 --> 1:28:31.682
you try to pawn me off onto some woman
who doesn't even want me?

1:28:31.765 --> 1:28:33.642
Do you not realize
how screwed-up that is?!

1:28:33.726 --> 1:28:36.603
Oh, fuck, Wally.

1:28:36.687 --> 1:28:38.564
When are you gonna grow up?!

1:28:38.647 --> 1:28:40.899
I am sorry that I am dying

1:28:40.983 --> 1:28:43.277
and something in this world
isn't about you.

1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.654
And I'm sorry that I gave up
on all the things

1:28:45.738 --> 1:28:47.656
that I wanted in life to make you happy.

1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:49.116
'Cause you know what?

1:28:49.199 --> 1:28:51.035
You are never happy!

1:28:51.118 --> 1:28:52.745
I didn't make you give up anything.

1:28:52.828 --> 1:28:55.247
That is all you
because that is what you do.

1:28:55.330 --> 1:28:58.250
You don't bet on yourself.
You don't believe you can win.

1:28:58.333 --> 1:29:01.670
But, hey, at least you're gonna leave me
with a clear philosophy, right?

1:29:01.754 --> 1:29:03.213
I'm not leaving you with that.

1:29:03.297 --> 1:29:06.592
Then why wouldn't you let them
try to take the tumor out?!

1:29:09.428 --> 1:29:11.555
What do you want me to say?

1:29:11.638 --> 1:29:14.725
That you're not gonna die.

1:29:14.808 --> 1:29:17.728
I thought you didn't want me
to lie to you, baby.

1:29:17.811 --> 1:29:21.607
Is it 100% certain
that the surgery won't work?

1:29:23.817 --> 1:29:25.694
-No, but...
-So, if you do nothing,

1:29:25.778 --> 1:29:30.324
you definitely die, and if you
do something, you potentially live.

1:29:30.407 --> 1:29:32.576
How is that not a clear choice?

1:29:35.871 --> 1:29:38.415
I don't want you for one year, Dad.

1:29:40.375 --> 1:29:42.920
I want you for my whole life.

1:29:43.962 --> 1:29:48.425
Don't you want to yell at me when I get
some stupid tattoo like you did?

1:29:48.509 --> 1:29:50.552
You're supposed to-- I don't know.

1:29:50.636 --> 1:29:53.305
You're supposed to laugh
when I trip at my own wedding.

1:29:53.388 --> 1:29:55.224
And I'm supposed to be obnoxious

1:29:55.307 --> 1:29:58.685
when you finally introduce me
to some woman you're dating.

1:29:58.769 --> 1:30:00.437
Dad, I love you.

1:30:00.521 --> 1:30:03.816
And I know I don't always show it,
and I'm sorry,

1:30:03.899 --> 1:30:06.860
but, uh, I thought we had more time.

1:30:06.944 --> 1:30:09.905
I thought we were gonna go back
to that field in Texas

1:30:09.988 --> 1:30:11.281
and watch the meteor shower.

1:30:11.365 --> 1:30:15.160
I thought... I thought we were gonna
do all that stuff together.

1:30:16.829 --> 1:30:18.497
Don't you want to?

1:30:21.500 --> 1:30:23.502
You have no idea.

1:30:24.586 --> 1:30:27.506
We don't get to unless you're willing
to take a chance.

1:30:29.174 --> 1:30:30.926
Please, Dad.

1:30:31.009 --> 1:30:32.928
I'd bet on you.

1:30:40.435 --> 1:30:41.895
Okay.

1:30:44.982 --> 1:30:46.275
Okay?

1:30:46.358 --> 1:30:47.901
-Okay.
-Okay?

1:30:47.985 --> 1:30:48.986
Okay.

1:31:04.042 --> 1:31:05.627
We were just standing still
and the girl...
