WEBVTT

00:03.173 --> 00:04.675
Forget it.

00:04.795 --> 00:06.062
It's impossible.

00:06.096 --> 00:07.229
It's not gonna work
in a million years.

00:07.264 --> 00:08.264
It's pointless.
I give up.

00:08.298 --> 00:09.432
Good attitude, honey.

00:09.466 --> 00:11.067
Well, you know,
what do you want from me?

00:11.101 --> 00:14.270
I'm trying to get a group
of people to give me their land,

00:14.304 --> 00:18.140
rather than sell it to Gryzzl
for $90 million.

00:18.175 --> 00:19.775
Right now, my basic argument is,

00:19.810 --> 00:22.678
"Please, give us the land.
It would be so nice."

00:22.713 --> 00:25.681
Gryzzl has billions of dollars.
There's no way I beat them.

00:25.716 --> 00:28.384
Hey, I've seen you beat
tougher odds than this.

00:28.418 --> 00:31.220
But they're just a company,
they're not that powerful.

00:32.689 --> 00:33.623
Whoa!

00:33.657 --> 00:36.125
"Open your door"?

00:37.261 --> 00:38.294
Ah!

00:38.328 --> 00:40.763
Oh, my God, Ben!
We're about to die.

00:40.797 --> 00:42.365
- Good lord!
- Oh, my--

00:42.399 --> 00:43.833
The robots have come for us.

00:43.867 --> 00:45.268
I made fun of you
when you said it would happen

00:45.302 --> 00:46.869
but your novel has come true.

00:46.903 --> 00:47.937
Hey, Leslie Knope!

00:47.971 --> 00:49.639
Please enjoy this free gift,

00:49.673 --> 00:51.674
courtesy of Gryzzl.

00:51.708 --> 00:53.909
Okay,
so they also have a squadron

00:53.944 --> 00:57.480
of flying robots giving presents
to everyone.

00:57.514 --> 00:59.015
We're screwed.

01:20.103 --> 01:21.037
New dish we're working on.

01:21.071 --> 01:22.505
Tell me what you think.

01:22.539 --> 01:25.474
It's a red and white heirloom
red bean pasta,

01:25.509 --> 01:27.710
with an imported
Tuscan walnut herb sauce,

01:27.744 --> 01:30.279
infused with shaved heritage
Pecorino Romano.

01:30.314 --> 01:31.280
What?
You're done?

01:31.315 --> 01:33.015
Mmm.
Really good.

01:33.050 --> 01:33.983
Why are you doing new dishes?

01:35.285 --> 01:38.721
Lucy is visiting her boyfriend
Conrad in Chicago,

01:38.755 --> 01:40.156
so I'm just trying to distract
myself with work

01:40.190 --> 01:42.024
so I don't think
about the marathon bone sesh

01:42.059 --> 01:43.025
they're probably having.

01:43.060 --> 01:43.993
Hey, you know what, dude?

01:44.027 --> 01:45.027
You gotta take your mind
off of them.

01:45.062 --> 01:46.796
Check this out.

01:46.830 --> 01:48.497
It's a contract.

01:48.532 --> 01:50.199
It came from the station manager
where I do my show,

01:50.233 --> 01:52.368
<i>Johnny Karate.</i>
He wants me to sign it,

01:52.402 --> 01:55.371
but is says that they'll own
the character, "Johnny Karate."

01:55.405 --> 01:57.873
And I want to own the character
Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me.

01:57.908 --> 01:59.976
Wait, this says they only pay
you a hundred bucks a week?

02:00.010 --> 02:02.645
Yeah, but all I really do
is goof around all day.

02:02.679 --> 02:04.347
Write, produce,
and direct a TV show.

02:04.381 --> 02:07.483
Plus, I act in it,
and I do sets, props, wardrobe.

02:07.517 --> 02:09.318
At the end, I drive everybody
home, so I mean,

02:09.353 --> 02:12.121
a hundred bucks a week--
that's pretty fair.

02:12.155 --> 02:14.023
This is perfect.
I'll be your agent!

02:14.057 --> 02:16.692
I'll put all my energy into
renegotiating your contract.

02:16.727 --> 02:18.461
I won't even think
about Lucy and Conrad

02:18.495 --> 02:22.131
and his stupid crunches
that he probably does.

02:22.165 --> 02:25.067
I should probably do some
crunches.

02:25.102 --> 02:26.102
Let's go!

02:26.136 --> 02:28.838
Ow!
Andy, my tum tum!

02:29.840 --> 02:31.140
Knope, I need to talk to you.

02:31.174 --> 02:32.241
What's up?

02:32.276 --> 02:34.010
I know I technically work
for Gryzzl,

02:34.044 --> 02:35.912
but these fools
have crossed a line.

02:35.946 --> 02:37.413
Have you gotten one of these
GryzzlBoxes?

02:37.447 --> 02:39.415
Well, yeah,
but I haven't opened it yet.

02:39.449 --> 02:42.251
Planning on sending it back
after I wrote a sternly-worded

02:42.286 --> 02:44.954
letter about how I cannot be
bought with free gifts.

02:44.988 --> 02:47.490
These are my free gifts.

02:47.524 --> 02:49.325
Two honey bears...

02:49.359 --> 02:51.928
and a canister of sugar plums.

02:51.962 --> 02:54.563
"Honeybear" and "Sugar Plum"
are the special names

02:54.598 --> 02:55.998
Joe and I call each other.

02:56.033 --> 02:57.166
Aww.

02:57.201 --> 02:59.468
Yeah, we're adorable,
but this is creepy.

02:59.503 --> 03:01.137
Because we only call each other
these things

03:01.171 --> 03:03.039
on the phone or in texts.

03:03.073 --> 03:05.574
How do they even know?

03:05.609 --> 03:08.377
Leslie, open that box
they sent you.

03:08.412 --> 03:11.447
Ooh! Joe Biden's book,
<i>"Biden the Rails:</i>

03:11.481 --> 03:13.683
<i>1001 Poems</i>
<i>Inspired by My Travels</i>

03:13.717 --> 03:15.151
<i>Through Amtrak's Northeat</i>
<i>Corridor."</i>

03:15.185 --> 03:16.352
A thousand?

03:16.386 --> 03:18.888
A poster of the Supreme Court
Justices

03:18.922 --> 03:21.424
sipping the <i> Friends</i> milkshake!

03:21.458 --> 03:22.925
This stuff is perfect for me.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.494
Yeah, exactly.
They must be data-mining.

03:25.529 --> 03:27.296
Searching our texts and emails

03:27.331 --> 03:28.998
and gathering profiles
on all of us.

03:29.032 --> 03:31.167
This is a huge invasion
of privacy,

03:31.201 --> 03:32.668
not to mention illegal.

03:32.703 --> 03:34.770
When they installed their free
Wi-Fi in town,

03:34.805 --> 03:37.740
I made sure that there was
language preventing this.

03:37.774 --> 03:39.454
I never would have agreed
to work with them

03:39.476 --> 03:41.644
if I had known they were gonna
be snooping in my biz.

03:41.678 --> 03:43.613
Gryzzl is going down.

03:43.647 --> 03:45.181
You wanna put me on blast?

03:45.215 --> 03:46.582
I'ma put you on Front Street.

03:46.617 --> 03:47.783
I don't understand what
that means,

03:47.818 --> 03:50.286
but I think I get the context,
and I love it.

03:51.521 --> 03:53.689
April, the new Parks interns
start today,

03:53.724 --> 03:56.058
and I was wondering if you would
deliver a little welcome speech.

03:56.093 --> 03:57.893
No, go away.

03:57.928 --> 04:01.264
Watermelon, martinis, exposed
brick, Keri Russell's hair.

04:01.298 --> 04:03.299
Why did you just say those
weird things?

04:03.333 --> 04:05.735
On the advice of my therapist,
Dr. Richard Nygard,

04:05.769 --> 04:08.004
whenever I feel like yelling,
I just take a deep breath

04:08.038 --> 04:10.306
and say three great things
about being alive.

04:10.340 --> 04:13.309
- Gross.
- Please talk to my interns.

04:13.343 --> 04:15.344
Fine.
Whatever, I'll do it.

04:15.379 --> 04:17.046
I started here when I was 20,

04:17.079 --> 04:19.949
and now I'm old and gross
and directionless.

04:19.983 --> 04:22.552
Those kids are me ten years ago,

04:22.586 --> 04:25.021
and this internship
is the videotape from <i> The Ring.</i>

04:25.055 --> 04:27.356
It's too late for me.
I've seen too much.

04:27.391 --> 04:29.825
But maybe I can save them.

04:29.860 --> 04:32.762
You're all gonna die in here!

04:32.796 --> 04:34.196
Hello, everyone.

04:34.231 --> 04:36.666
We are here today
to discuss Gryzzl,

04:36.700 --> 04:38.534
and whether or not they
are invading our privacy.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.569
They sent my husband
three boxes of genital cream

04:40.571 --> 04:42.071
to his office.

04:42.105 --> 04:44.907
My husband's splotchy genitals
are no one's business,

04:44.942 --> 04:48.511
except for his, mine,
and his many genital doctors.

04:50.113 --> 04:53.582
They sent me a bunch of toy
pigs dressed like movie stars.

04:53.617 --> 04:54.984
That's my private hobby.

04:55.018 --> 04:58.321
No one knows I collect toy pigs
dressed like movie stars,

04:58.355 --> 04:59.922
except now all of you people.

04:59.957 --> 05:01.157
Which one is that?

05:01.191 --> 05:03.359
This is actually
Ham-uel L. Jackson

05:03.393 --> 05:05.661
from the movie,<i> Pork Fiction,</i>
it's extremely rare,

05:05.696 --> 05:07.029
and I am keeping it.

05:07.064 --> 05:09.465
But still, they no right to give
me something I will treasure

05:09.499 --> 05:11.167
the rest of my life.

05:11.201 --> 05:13.536
I opened my box
in front of all of my friends,

05:13.570 --> 05:16.339
and it was a bunch
of Virginia Woolf novels.

05:16.373 --> 05:18.808
Now Miley and Haley
know I like to read.

05:18.842 --> 05:20.209
What if they tell Evan?

05:20.243 --> 05:22.712
I like their phones,
but they've gone too far

05:22.746 --> 05:24.680
sending this stuff
to our houses.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.283
Gryzzl has no right
to search our private data.

05:27.317 --> 05:31.053
So wait, you guys are not
against us on this?

05:31.088 --> 05:32.822
We're not against you on this.

05:32.856 --> 05:35.458
We're not against you on this.

05:35.492 --> 05:37.326
We're not against you
on this.

05:37.361 --> 05:39.662
Finally, after months
of searching for a way

05:39.696 --> 05:43.099
to defeat Gryzzl, we have found
its Achilles' heel.

05:43.133 --> 05:45.835
The town is behind us,
Donna is on our side,

05:45.869 --> 05:47.536
and the next domino to fall?

05:47.571 --> 05:49.605
Ron Swanson.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.242
Actually, this is Tom Sell-oink,
but, you know, close enough.

05:53.277 --> 05:54.644
Actually,
I'm gonna need that back.

05:54.678 --> 05:55.678
Oh, yes, of course.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.622
February 2016--I think
you're gonna really enjoy

06:00.742 --> 06:02.109
this month's photo album.

06:02.143 --> 06:05.352
It includes such hits as:
"First Trip to the Dentist,"

06:05.472 --> 06:07.006
"Sonia Tries Pizza,"

06:07.041 --> 06:09.476
and "Waterpark Vomit
Chain Reaction."

06:09.510 --> 06:11.177
Why would you take pictures
of that?

06:11.212 --> 06:12.912
- Why would you not?
- As you requested,

06:12.947 --> 06:16.049
here's a picture of my son
at a recent moment in his life.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.484
So cute--

06:18.519 --> 06:21.554
What are you doing?
- Protecting my son's privacy.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.490
What, I'm just gonna carry
around pictures of my child

06:23.524 --> 06:24.824
where anyone could see them?

06:24.859 --> 06:26.793
Well, it's funny you should
mention privacy

06:26.827 --> 06:28.461
because that's our next topic.

06:28.495 --> 06:30.797
Ron technically works
for Gryzzl.

06:30.831 --> 06:32.565
And when he finds out
what Gryzzl is doing,

06:32.600 --> 06:35.935
he is going to lose. His. Mind.

06:37.404 --> 06:39.606
- I have no reaction to this.
- What?

06:39.640 --> 06:41.241
I do not pass judgment
on the workings

06:41.275 --> 06:42.642
of private businesses.

06:42.676 --> 06:44.144
I just build their buildings.

06:44.178 --> 06:45.779
And frankly,
if people are foolish enough

06:45.813 --> 06:47.247
to carry around a doodad

06:47.281 --> 06:49.782
that lets Gryzzl
track their every move,

06:49.817 --> 06:50.950
this is what they get.

06:50.985 --> 06:52.719
But it's illegal.

06:52.753 --> 06:54.153
I don't believe that's true.

06:54.188 --> 06:55.288
I've spent a fair amount of time

06:55.322 --> 06:56.643
with Gryzzl's high-priced
lawyers,

06:56.657 --> 06:59.559
and they do seem to,
as they say,

06:59.593 --> 07:01.361
"keep it 100."

07:01.395 --> 07:03.696
Well, those fools
still think I work for them.

07:03.731 --> 07:05.865
So I can get you a private VIP
tour of the building.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.435
Maybe you can snoop around.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.136
Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe.

07:10.171 --> 07:11.638
Psyched to give you guys a tour.

07:11.672 --> 07:14.073
Yes, hello,
I'm Darlene Johannsen,

07:14.108 --> 07:16.176
and this is my
assistant-turned-lover,

07:16.210 --> 07:17.810
Gregory Strong.

07:17.845 --> 07:20.947
Ours is a new romance,
but one that sent shockwaves

07:20.981 --> 07:22.649
through my architecture firm.

07:22.683 --> 07:24.417
- But it feels so right.
- Steady.

07:24.451 --> 07:28.188
We love Gryzzl, and we would
love to see how it all works.

07:28.222 --> 07:31.391
Sweet.
Let's get loco.

07:31.425 --> 07:34.561
Okay, so, let's get to know
each other.

07:34.595 --> 07:36.262
Talk about why you're here,

07:36.297 --> 07:37.697
whether you're throwing
your lives away,

07:37.731 --> 07:39.365
stuff like that.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.833
Uh, you, what brought you here?

07:40.868 --> 07:42.135
I love the Parks department.

07:42.169 --> 07:43.269
I grew up near Ramsett Park

07:43.304 --> 07:44.537
and I used to go
to tons of stuff there.

07:44.572 --> 07:45.939
Okay, that doesn't help me.

07:45.973 --> 07:47.140
Uh, Mork?

07:47.174 --> 07:48.575
Oh, it's Mike.

07:48.609 --> 07:50.543
I love parks,
more than anything,

07:50.578 --> 07:52.946
and I've been a summer camp
counselor since I was 13.

07:52.980 --> 07:54.280
Ugh. Gross.

07:54.315 --> 07:56.182
What about you?
Why are you here?

07:56.217 --> 07:58.151
The only thing I love more
than parks is recreation.

07:58.185 --> 07:59.152
Really?

07:59.186 --> 08:00.253
No, I just needed college
credit.

08:00.287 --> 08:01.287
What are you studying?

08:01.322 --> 08:02.288
Nothing.
College is stupid.

08:02.323 --> 08:03.556
Then who made you do this.

08:03.591 --> 08:05.458
- My parents.
- What are they like?

08:05.493 --> 08:07.613
Well, my mom's the devil
and my dad's a dumb doctor.

08:07.628 --> 08:09.562
- Oh, my dad's a doctor.
- Shut up.

08:09.597 --> 08:11.030
- Jen is it?
- Yeah.

08:11.065 --> 08:12.365
Let's take a walk, Jen.

08:12.399 --> 08:14.467
I feel like you have
almost zero potential.

08:14.502 --> 08:15.702
I think that's cool.

08:15.736 --> 08:17.070
And action!

08:17.104 --> 08:20.206
We meet again,
Puppy-Hating Dan.

08:20.241 --> 08:21.741
You stole my guitar.

08:21.775 --> 08:24.043
And you put farts in my lunch.

08:25.112 --> 08:26.613
You've really done it this time.

08:26.647 --> 08:28.515
Puppy Army, attack!

08:28.549 --> 08:29.749
Yeah!

08:29.784 --> 08:31.251
What? No!

08:31.285 --> 08:32.919
I hate puppies.

08:32.953 --> 08:34.587
I'll admit to everything.

08:34.621 --> 08:36.155
You win again, Macklin.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.890
Another mystery solved!

08:37.924 --> 08:41.193
We'll be right back after this
with some more <i> Johnny Karate.</i>

08:41.227 --> 08:42.294
Okay, that's lunch, everyone.

08:42.328 --> 08:44.063
We're back in 30 minutes.

08:44.097 --> 08:45.532
Great job, bud, you crushed it!

08:45.566 --> 08:47.000
I love being Andy's agent.

08:47.034 --> 08:49.836
He does all the work, and I get
10% just for showing up.

08:49.870 --> 08:51.905
It's like a chef
at a restaurant,

08:51.939 --> 08:54.240
making all the food, and then
the owner gets a profit--

08:54.275 --> 08:56.309
which is my other job!

08:56.343 --> 08:58.678
Man, I really got things
figured out.

08:58.713 --> 08:59.946
Let's make this quick.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.315
Andy's show gets huge ratings
in three cities.

09:02.349 --> 09:05.018
His GryzzlTube page
has millions of views.

09:05.052 --> 09:07.020
If you don't Andy walking over
to your rival station

09:07.054 --> 09:10.190
in Snerling, I think you should
start taking this seriously.

09:10.224 --> 09:12.492
Right. Okay,
here's what we're gonna do.

09:12.526 --> 09:14.427
I'm gonna upgrade
the parking spot.

09:14.461 --> 09:16.563
But my son gets a role
as one of the kid ninjas.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.431
All right?
He's gonna love me for it.

09:18.465 --> 09:20.500
It's gonna drive
my ex-wife crazy.

09:20.534 --> 09:21.968
So far, so good, but, uh,

09:22.002 --> 09:23.242
in the words of Jerry Maguire--

09:23.270 --> 09:24.838
- "The human head weighs
8 pounds."

09:24.872 --> 09:27.173
No.
"Show me the money."

09:27.208 --> 09:29.309
Andy, do you know how lucky
you are to work here?

09:29.343 --> 09:30.643
I'm a kingmaker.

09:30.678 --> 09:34.981
Pep Wiley, Chuck Warschank,
Selena Gomez--I made them.

09:35.015 --> 09:36.749
You discovered Selena Gomez?

09:36.784 --> 09:38.051
Different Selena Gomez.

09:38.085 --> 09:39.752
Look, I don't have the money
for a raise.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.255
Uh, yeah you do.
I've seen profit reports.

09:42.289 --> 09:45.125
The show's a bonanza.
Andy starts making 500 a week.

09:45.159 --> 09:47.227
Now.

09:47.261 --> 09:48.895
Get the hell out of my office,
both of you--

09:48.929 --> 09:50.296
- Sit down.
- I don't...

09:50.331 --> 09:53.399
Look, dude, this internship
leads nowhere.

09:53.434 --> 09:57.203
It'll just screw up
the rest of your life.

09:57.238 --> 09:59.205
- What do you love doing?
- Texting.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.341
What did you want to be when
you were little?

10:01.375 --> 10:04.344
A scary mermaid that lures
sailors to their death.

10:04.378 --> 10:06.613
Okay, side note,
I'm gonna file papers

10:06.647 --> 10:09.549
to adopt you as my child,
so keep an eye out for that.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.619
But more importantly,
don't do this internship.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.020
Go do something fun

10:14.054 --> 10:16.556
like trying to control birds
with your mind

10:16.590 --> 10:21.361
or posting internet comments
as Michael Jackson's ghost.

10:21.395 --> 10:23.897
Okay.
Maybe you're right.

10:23.931 --> 10:26.132
Thanks.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.468
Hey, April, we finished those
questionnaires you gave us

10:28.502 --> 10:30.170
about our hopes and dreams
for the internship.

10:30.204 --> 10:33.606
Great!
Thanks, Mike!

10:36.610 --> 10:38.211
Oh, I'm sorry this building
is so lame.

10:38.245 --> 10:39.712
As soon as we get our new
headquarters built,

10:39.747 --> 10:41.347
it's gonna be way, way, tighter.

10:41.382 --> 10:42.949
Check it.
Matty.

10:42.983 --> 10:44.784
Okay, this is GryzzlVibe.

10:44.819 --> 10:46.152
It's this new app
that we're developing

10:46.187 --> 10:48.054
that monitors your mood.
Tell them about it.

10:48.088 --> 10:51.124
As you know, the cameras
on your phones are always on,

10:51.158 --> 10:52.125
whether you're using them
or not.

10:52.159 --> 10:53.626
I'm sorry, they are?

10:53.661 --> 10:56.496
This app uses facial
recognition software

10:56.530 --> 10:58.064
to track your expressions.

10:58.099 --> 10:59.499
It's always watching.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.335
Well, what do you do
with this information?

11:02.369 --> 11:04.771
Well, if the camera senses
that you're in a bad mood,

11:04.805 --> 11:07.140
then we can geo-match you to,
say, the nearest cup

11:07.174 --> 11:08.775
of sweet pick-me-up java.

11:08.809 --> 11:12.345
But if you're in a good mood,
then we could geo-nudge you

11:12.379 --> 11:13.980
to, like, a sweet coffee shop.

11:13.981 --> 11:16.249
Just keep the good times
rolling.

11:16.283 --> 11:18.451
So it's really just a coffee
sales app.

11:18.486 --> 11:19.752
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:19.787 --> 11:20.887
Yeah, we're developing
with Starbucks.

11:20.921 --> 11:21.888
Yeah.

11:21.922 --> 11:24.290
So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl

11:24.325 --> 11:26.626
know all the things
that someone wants?

11:26.660 --> 11:31.731
Are you guys...I don't know,
whatever--data-mining?

11:31.765 --> 11:33.766
Oh, hells yeah, dog-man.

11:33.801 --> 11:38.004
Our super rad algorithm searches
all your texts, calls, banking,

11:38.038 --> 11:40.039
medical records,
blah, blah, blah,

11:40.074 --> 11:42.442
to learn what you really want.

11:42.476 --> 11:44.511
You know, from snacks
to new books and movies

11:44.545 --> 11:47.280
to when you ladies need to score
some new 'pons.

11:47.314 --> 11:50.116
I mean, we might know you better
than you know yourself, Leslie.

11:50.150 --> 11:52.252
How did you know it was me?

11:52.286 --> 11:53.853
Oh, there's about
40 different ways.

11:53.888 --> 11:56.823
I mean, geo-maps on your
different Gryzzl devices,

11:56.857 --> 11:58.658
and, of course, we face-scanned
you when you came in.

11:58.692 --> 11:59.726
Really glad you're here.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.461
Okay, good.

12:01.495 --> 12:03.429
Just 'cause we're competing
for the Newport land

12:03.464 --> 12:04.898
doesn't mean that we can't be
friends.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.299
- No.
- Isn't that your motto?

12:06.333 --> 12:08.013
"Wouldn't it be tight
if everyone was chill

12:08.035 --> 12:09.002
to each other?"

12:09.036 --> 12:10.003
Totes.

12:10.037 --> 12:11.571
And I hope that you can see now

12:11.605 --> 12:13.773
that there's nothing scary
about Gryzzl.

12:13.808 --> 12:16.276
I mean, we just wanna learn
everything about everyone

12:16.310 --> 12:17.550
and track them wherever they go

12:17.578 --> 12:19.712
and anticipate what they're
about to do.

12:19.747 --> 12:21.981
These are really interesting
issues, Roscoe.

12:22.016 --> 12:24.851
I think maybe we could debate
them, you know?

12:24.885 --> 12:27.454
- On TV.
- TV. Retro.

12:27.488 --> 12:29.155
I love it.
All right.

12:29.190 --> 12:32.192
I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.

12:32.226 --> 12:33.226
Later, chillerz.

12:37.162 --> 12:39.130
This is <i>The Perdples Court,</i>

12:39.164 --> 12:42.200
a legal debate show
about issues facing residents

12:42.234 --> 12:43.701
of Southern Indiana.

12:43.735 --> 12:46.738
With your host,
Judge Perd Hapley.

12:46.772 --> 12:48.506
Tonight, on <i>The Perdples Court,</i>

12:48.540 --> 12:50.508
we will have the guests
that have been booked

12:50.542 --> 12:51.943
for tonight's show--

12:51.977 --> 12:54.679
the plaintiff, Leslie Knope,
who has some big allegations

12:54.713 --> 12:55.813
against Gryzzl.

12:55.848 --> 12:57.882
The defendant,
Gryzzl Vice President

12:57.916 --> 12:59.350
Roscoe Santangelo.

12:59.385 --> 13:01.152
Who will win?
I don't know yet.

13:01.186 --> 13:03.121
Which is what makes
this a court show.

13:03.155 --> 13:05.223
We have public opinion
on our side,

13:05.257 --> 13:07.291
and we have proof that Gryzzl
has been data-mining.

13:07.326 --> 13:08.960
But there's one more thing
we need.

13:08.994 --> 13:13.264
The one thing that Americans
respect more than anything else:

13:13.298 --> 13:16.634
public humiliation
on live television.

13:16.668 --> 13:19.604
Leslie, don't humiliate
yourself on television.

13:19.638 --> 13:20.938
Swanson, what are you doing
here?

13:20.973 --> 13:23.841
This is the 27th version
of the Pawnee-Gryzzl

13:23.876 --> 13:26.177
free wireless internet thing
agreement.

13:26.211 --> 13:28.413
Check out the page I marked.

13:28.447 --> 13:31.049
Yeah, "Gryzzl is not allowed
to collect and use customer data

13:31.083 --> 13:33.518
for any purpose."
It's pretty clear. See?

13:33.552 --> 13:37.088
Look closer, amendment "C,"
addendum 14.

13:37.122 --> 13:41.092
It directs you to this appendix,
which reroutes you to this one

13:41.126 --> 13:44.595
which says, in a sub-footnote:

13:44.630 --> 13:45.697
It says here
they can gather and use

13:45.731 --> 13:47.598
any information they want.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.400
How did I miss this?

13:49.435 --> 13:50.601
Look at the revision date.

13:50.636 --> 13:53.371
December 18, 2015.

13:53.405 --> 13:56.641
That was the opening day
of <i> Star Wars: Episode VII.</i>

13:56.675 --> 13:59.077
You were muttering that date
in your sleep for months.

13:59.111 --> 14:02.013
They knew you'd be distracted.
That's how they slipped it in.

14:02.047 --> 14:03.614
I did this to the town.

14:03.649 --> 14:05.383
It's my fault.

14:05.417 --> 14:09.654
It's Ice Town all over again.

14:09.688 --> 14:14.192
Is <i>Star Wars</i> the one
with the little wizard boy?

14:14.226 --> 14:16.594
Okay, this is what
I can give you.

14:16.628 --> 14:19.797
No more janitorial duties,
better parking spot,

14:19.832 --> 14:22.600
unlimited Mike and Ikes
from the vending machine,

14:22.634 --> 14:25.036
and for salary,
we're at 500 a week.

14:25.070 --> 14:26.504
500 whats?

14:26.538 --> 14:28.039
Dollars, man.

14:28.073 --> 14:29.507
What about the rights
to Johnny Karate?

14:29.541 --> 14:30.808
We own the rights
to Johnny Karate

14:30.843 --> 14:32.110
I can't bend on that one.

14:32.144 --> 14:33.578
But I invented the character.

14:33.612 --> 14:34.579
Well, invent another character.

14:34.613 --> 14:37.415
Uh, here you go:
Kung-Fu Billy.

14:37.449 --> 14:38.850
Jeremy Punch-Guy.

14:38.884 --> 14:40.151
Ed Kick.

14:40.185 --> 14:42.120
Those are actually pretty great.

14:42.154 --> 14:44.589
But Johnny Karate
is special to me.

14:44.623 --> 14:48.593
If we can't get the rights,
I'm gonna walk.

14:48.627 --> 14:50.495
He's making the biggest
mistake of his life.

14:50.529 --> 14:52.196
He's walking out on Hank Muntak?

14:52.231 --> 14:54.365
I have six Lower Great Lakes
Emmy Awards.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.401
I once sat in the original
Batmobile.

14:56.435 --> 14:59.670
James Woods follows my niece
on Twitter.

14:59.705 --> 15:01.072
He's gonna regret this.

15:01.106 --> 15:03.141
All this work,
everything I've done

15:03.175 --> 15:05.376
for this city,
it's all a wash now.

15:05.411 --> 15:06.778
Everyone's gonna hate me again.

15:06.812 --> 15:08.546
Some of us are already there,
Wyatt.

15:08.580 --> 15:11.816
This is not your fault.
Ron, talk some sense into him.

15:11.850 --> 15:14.185
Ben's right.
This is Ice Town all over again.

15:14.219 --> 15:15.319
- I--
- Ron!

15:15.354 --> 15:16.587
If you're gonna sign

15:16.622 --> 15:17.956
a legally binding document,

15:17.990 --> 15:19.557
you need to read it thoroughly.

15:19.591 --> 15:21.292
That's why the only contract
I've ever signed

15:21.326 --> 15:23.861
is my Mulligan's Steakhouse
club card.

15:23.896 --> 15:26.197
And even then,
I used a fake name.

15:26.231 --> 15:27.532
Les.

15:27.566 --> 15:29.400
Les Vegetables.

15:29.435 --> 15:30.702
Don't worry, okay?

15:30.736 --> 15:32.370
You're not gonna take the fall
for this.

15:32.404 --> 15:35.339
Ron, make sure that Donna
doesn't hurt him.

15:36.775 --> 15:37.909
You wanted to see me?

15:37.943 --> 15:40.011
Yes, can you tell me where
Jennifer is?

15:40.045 --> 15:41.279
I convincer her to quit.

15:41.313 --> 15:43.414
Martha Stewarts apron line,

15:43.449 --> 15:46.050
my tomato plants--
oh, God, I'm out!

15:46.085 --> 15:47.318
Where is my emergency list?

15:47.352 --> 15:49.087
Recently, I've been feeling

15:49.121 --> 15:51.489
like I've wasted
the last ten years of my life,

15:51.523 --> 15:53.224
and it all started
with this internship,

15:53.258 --> 15:56.227
and I don't want those kids to
make the same mistake, okay?

15:56.261 --> 15:58.796
April, you spent the last
ten years doing amazing things

15:58.831 --> 16:00.231
with this Parks department,
and learning

16:00.265 --> 16:01.966
from the greatest teacher
in this or any business,

16:02.001 --> 16:03.768
Leslie Freaking Knope!

16:03.802 --> 16:05.403
You'd be a checkout girl
at a gas station

16:05.437 --> 16:07.739
if it wasn't for that
internship.

16:09.475 --> 16:11.909
Sweet potato pie, unlikely
animal friend pairings,

16:11.944 --> 16:14.278
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

16:14.313 --> 16:15.880
You're lucky to have worked
here,

16:15.914 --> 16:18.182
no matter what you want to do
with the rest of your life.

16:18.217 --> 16:20.351
And I think you know that.

16:20.386 --> 16:25.423
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go find a new intern.

16:25.457 --> 16:27.825
Now Leslie, I understand
that what you've brought

16:27.860 --> 16:30.061
to the show
isn't a box of objects

16:30.095 --> 16:32.897
but rather a symbolic box
of allegations.

16:32.931 --> 16:36.234
- Well, Perd--
- It's "Judge Perd."

16:36.268 --> 16:39.070
Okay, uh, I think there are
certain questions

16:39.104 --> 16:44.509
about certain aspects of certain
parts of this situation

16:44.543 --> 16:49.614
that require an evaluation
about whether or not

16:49.648 --> 16:52.583
this is or is not a valid
argument.

16:52.618 --> 16:54.319
Extremely well-put.

16:54.353 --> 16:56.020
Excuse me, Judge Perd?

16:56.055 --> 16:57.822
I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager.

16:57.856 --> 17:00.658
What Gryzzl is doing with our
private information

17:00.692 --> 17:05.596
may not technically be illegal,
but it's definitely not chill.

17:05.631 --> 17:08.199
Whoa! That's a serious
allegaysh, homie.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.400
We are hella chill.

17:09.435 --> 17:11.836
And frankly,
if you don't like our vibe,

17:11.869 --> 17:13.204
you don't have to use our shizz.

17:13.238 --> 17:15.138
Well, we kind of do.

17:15.174 --> 17:17.075
I mean, the internet
is no longer optional,

17:17.108 --> 17:19.544
it's a necessity for everyone.

17:19.578 --> 17:22.714
And I think you do know
that data-mining isn't chill,

17:22.748 --> 17:25.849
because you snuck it
into the 27th update

17:25.884 --> 17:29.821
of a 500-page user agreement.

17:29.855 --> 17:33.291
A person should not have to have
an advanced law degree

17:33.325 --> 17:35.126
to avoid being taken
advantage of

17:35.160 --> 17:37.862
by a multibillion dollar
company.

17:37.896 --> 17:41.065
You should be upfront
about what you're doing

17:41.100 --> 17:44.969
and allow people the ability
to opt out.

17:45.004 --> 17:49.707
To be honest, Judge Perd
is stumped by this case.

17:49.742 --> 17:52.677
I've also misplaced
my judge hammer.

17:52.711 --> 17:54.245
I cannot render a verdict here.

17:54.279 --> 17:57.615
Therefore, I must declare
a mistrial, which is a term

17:57.649 --> 18:00.118
I've heard people use
in the movies.

18:00.152 --> 18:02.453
Tap, tap, tap.
Case ended.

18:02.488 --> 18:04.188
And we're clear.

18:04.223 --> 18:05.307
All right, later, dudes.

18:09.244 --> 18:11.309
Hey, good news!
I think I found a job.

18:11.429 --> 18:12.310
There was an opening

18:12.345 --> 18:13.310
for a janitor at the TV station.

18:13.430 --> 18:15.013
Get this--they're gonna pay me
the minimum wage.

18:15.047 --> 18:16.815
Put your mop down, bud.

18:16.849 --> 18:18.183
I got you the rights
to Johnny Karate.

18:18.217 --> 18:19.884
No way!
How?

18:20.297 --> 18:21.897
Just a great agent I guess.

18:21.932 --> 18:23.633
Please, man, please!

18:23.667 --> 18:25.901
Andy's my friend,
and I want to do a good job,

18:25.936 --> 18:27.403
and there's this girl
I really like,

18:27.437 --> 18:30.506
and she lives in Chicago,
and she's still dating someone,

18:30.540 --> 18:32.008
- and I just feel like--
- Oh, God.

18:32.042 --> 18:33.576
Do you want to eat
at my restaurant for free?

18:33.610 --> 18:35.544
Every week, you could come once
a week, and it's free.

18:35.579 --> 18:38.047
Okay, okay, fine.
J-just stop!

18:38.081 --> 18:40.216
See?

18:40.250 --> 18:41.584
I told you it was gonna
work out.

18:41.618 --> 18:42.952
That's actually really good
advice for anything.

18:42.986 --> 18:45.755
If there's something
that you want badly,

18:45.789 --> 18:48.624
you just have to believe
that it's gonna work out.

18:51.094 --> 18:55.197
Hey, I am sorry that I screwed
up your life.

18:55.232 --> 18:58.601
I found a bunch of new potential
interns to replace Jen.

18:58.635 --> 18:59.669
Hi.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.870
How'd you manage that?

19:00.904 --> 19:03.072
I just thought,
"What would Leslie do?"

19:03.106 --> 19:06.742
So I handed out flyers
and I canvassed the college.

19:06.777 --> 19:08.544
I even baked a bunch of cookies.

19:08.578 --> 19:11.647
It was weird, I actually enjoyed
finding them.

19:11.681 --> 19:14.216
And I enjoyed bullying Jen
into quitting.

19:14.251 --> 19:16.171
Hmm. You should add
"telling people what to do"

19:16.186 --> 19:17.920
to your "perfect job"
description.

19:17.954 --> 19:19.221
Good idea.

19:19.256 --> 19:20.990
You should up your therapy
to seven times a week,

19:21.024 --> 19:23.759
stop dressing that way,
and give me your wallet.

19:23.794 --> 19:27.563
Victor Garber, James Garner,
Jennifer Garner.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.265
I go alphabetical now.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.435
Hey, you're back!
How was the trip?

19:32.469 --> 19:35.071
It was okay.
Kind of weird.

19:35.105 --> 19:36.605
Oh. Weird couple of days
for me too.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.208
Closed a bunch of deals,
did a bunch of crunches...

19:39.242 --> 19:41.777
Yeah, I broke up with Conrad.

19:41.812 --> 19:45.314
Which was a long time coming,
but still weird.

19:45.349 --> 19:48.084
So yeah, uh,
do you want to talk about it?

19:48.118 --> 19:50.753
Thanks. I don't think I'm
ready to discuss it just yet.

19:50.787 --> 19:53.389
But what I would like to do
is have a glass of wine

19:53.423 --> 19:54.957
and talk about that shade
Nicki Minaj

19:54.992 --> 19:56.926
threw at Jesse Eisenberg
at the BAFTA awards.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.995
- Mm. He deserved it.
- No. he didn't!

19:59.029 --> 20:00.396
Uh, settle in,

20:00.430 --> 20:02.999
because I have some very strong
feelings about this.

20:04.534 --> 20:06.535
They're all down.

20:06.570 --> 20:08.638
Thank God.
Sometimes I think they're

20:08.672 --> 20:10.506
somehow the first humans
who don't need sleep.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.808
Look, this Gryzzl thing,
it's complicated.

20:12.843 --> 20:15.277
But this isn't Ice Town.

20:15.312 --> 20:16.912
You have done so much
for this town,

20:16.947 --> 20:18.981
and people know that.

20:19.016 --> 20:20.449
I'm just sorry we couldn't
find something

20:20.484 --> 20:21.951
illegal on Gryzzl.

20:21.985 --> 20:23.719
If we're gonna stop them,
and you're gonna beat them

20:23.754 --> 20:26.622
on the Newport land,
we need more ammo.

20:32.162 --> 20:34.096
We need to talk.

20:34.131 --> 20:35.331
What is that?

20:35.365 --> 20:38.100
This is a flying robot
I just shot out of the sky

20:38.135 --> 20:40.436
after it delivered a package
to my house.

20:40.470 --> 20:43.239
I thought you didn't like
to pass judgment on business--

20:43.273 --> 20:46.142
- The package was addressed
to my son,

20:46.176 --> 20:48.077
who is four years old,

20:48.111 --> 20:50.880
and does not own
a Gryzzl doodad.

20:50.914 --> 20:53.393
Somehow the robots looked
at Diane's computer

20:53.513 --> 20:55.247
and learned something about my child

20:55.367 --> 20:56.979
and then brought him a box of presents,

20:57.283 --> 20:59.079
so I destroyed the robot.

20:59.860 --> 21:01.712
No one is safe from these bastards.

21:02.103 --> 21:03.740
Tell me what to do, Leslie.

21:05.045 --> 21:06.703
I wanna help you take them down.
