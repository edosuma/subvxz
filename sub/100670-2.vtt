00:46.750 --> 00:47.869
Oh...

00:47.870 --> 00:48.899
Bastard!

00:56.763 --> 00:58.442
You need to go electric.

00:58.443 --> 01:00.682
Great advice. Thanks.

01:00.683 --> 01:02.603
I saw you talking to yourself earlier.

01:03.910 --> 01:05.162
Excuse me?

01:05.163 --> 01:07.162
And you drink a lot.

01:07.163 --> 01:09.659
Okay, this might have
worked for you before,

01:09.660 --> 01:11.041
but just so you know, it's failing.

01:11.043 --> 01:13.344
And for your information, I'm not drunk.

01:13.345 --> 01:15.620
You will be by the end of the night.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.630
It's pull, by the way.

01:23.390 --> 01:25.559
No judgement on my part.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.099
I'm just making an observation.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.107
Well, go observe somewhere else.

01:29.108 --> 01:30.667
Oh-ho-ho.

01:30.668 --> 01:33.019
Wow! Are you always this defensive?

01:33.020 --> 01:35.100
Are you always this much of a dick?

01:37.470 --> 01:39.707
I... I'm not... I'm not drunk.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.259
He's just very...

01:41.260 --> 01:43.599
... very annoying.

Vodka. Straight.

02:25.548 --> 02:27.030
And make it double.

02:28.030 --> 02:29.229
Not because I'm Russian.

02:29.230 --> 02:30.559
Because it works.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.640
Kenny would be so touched.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.899
What do you want?

02:36.900 --> 02:38.199
Gin.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.510
Gin, please.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.899
I hear you are a walking miracle.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.719
- Oh, hallelujah!
- Ha!

02:45.720 --> 02:48.708
You know, when a bullet
has been through you,

02:48.709 --> 02:51.360
it leaves something behind.

02:54.510 --> 02:56.027
Poor Kenny.

02:56.028 --> 02:57.550
Oh, he'd hate this.

02:58.530 --> 02:59.740
He chose it.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.849
How do you know what he chose?

03:01.850 --> 03:02.879
Jumping off a building

03:02.880 --> 03:05.819
- is a very clear choice.
- Oh, bullshit. Don't say...

03:05.820 --> 03:08.110
Why is everyone saying he jumped?!

03:11.310 --> 03:13.640
Just be quiet.

03:13.650 --> 03:15.019
You must think of the family.

03:15.020 --> 03:18.779
Please, don't pretend... for one second,

03:18.780 --> 03:21.510
that you ever think of
anyone but yourself.

03:27.510 --> 03:30.279
- Oh...
- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.999
Oh, you...

03:33.000 --> 03:34.819
- Having a good night?
- Yeah, well, you know what?

03:34.820 --> 03:38.359
You've really got this whole, um,
smug face thing down, don't you?

03:38.360 --> 03:39.699
It's just my face.

03:39.700 --> 03:40.879
Tune!

03:40.880 --> 03:43.020
Yeah, he'd... he'd always play this

03:43.030 --> 03:45.060
when he won the office table tennis.

03:45.070 --> 03:47.659
Which wasn't very often, was it?

03:47.660 --> 03:49.139
Excuse me? I'm sorry.

03:49.140 --> 03:54.460
Um... did you... did you work
with Kenny at Bitter Pill?

03:54.470 --> 03:57.999
Uh, yeah... yeah, that's right.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.079
- How was he? I was...
- Jamie Hayward,

04:00.080 --> 04:02.879
founder, editor of Bitter Pill.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.330
Now, if you have any queries
about Kenny's work...

04:05.340 --> 04:06.839
- No, I...
- ... you can come to me.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.550
I have no queries.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.379
Excuse me.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.960
Hmm.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.140
Can you make sure everyone's
topped up, please?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.219
♪ Giving back the time... ♪

06:00.220 --> 06:01.879
Oh.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.068

06:08.380 --> 06:10.787

06:10.788 --> 06:13.110

06:22.748 --> 06:24.030
It's you.

06:25.310 --> 06:26.670
It's you!

06:28.270 --> 06:30.079
It was one of Mum's dinners.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.819
I was about eight, nine,

06:31.820 --> 06:36.299
and I'd had a nightmare and you
found me crying on the stairs.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.460
Hmm!

06:37.470 --> 06:40.079
You told me you were
there as monster watch,

06:40.080 --> 06:43.400
to make sure that nothing scary
would come into the house.

06:43.410 --> 06:47.187
And... then you taught me
how to swear in Russian.

06:47.188 --> 06:48.947
- I did?
- Mudak.

06:51.388 --> 06:53.507
- I did.
- Yeah.

06:53.508 --> 06:55.627
You haven't changed a bit.

06:55.628 --> 06:57.147
You have!

06:57.148 --> 06:59.519
Geraldine, can you ask them
to change that music?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.899
It's terribly dreary.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.699
Today isn't about pretending
we're not sad, Mum.

07:03.700 --> 07:07.359
It's about acknowledging
the sadness together.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.590
Couldn't we be sad and
listen to good music?

07:15.720 --> 07:18.499
- She staying long with you?
- No idea.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.000
Apparently, she wants to help me grieve.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.519
Do you need help?

07:24.520 --> 07:26.239
Absolutely not.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.579
Just excuse me.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.867
Um, Eve...

07:32.868 --> 07:35.307
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:35.308 --> 07:37.799
I left you several messages.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.380
Oh...

07:39.388 --> 07:41.827
Eve, it's push, by the way. Can we talk?

07:49.390 --> 07:52.399
Do you think he jumped?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.030
Yes.

07:55.990 --> 07:57.310
Hmm!

07:58.870 --> 08:01.499
- Eve, I need you to...
- No.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.399
- But, Eve, Eve...
- I said no! Do you hear me?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.230
No! No!

08:05.240 --> 08:07.239
No!

08:07.240 --> 08:08.780
Bloody hell.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.739
Just... didn't like the buffet.

09:21.830 --> 09:23.510
Hmm.

09:24.520 --> 09:29.479
You ask Dasha for the best,
Dasha gets you the best.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.060
You're welcome.

09:32.068 --> 09:33.987
Everything you asked for.

09:33.988 --> 09:36.459
Good light, high ceilings.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.939
Chan, did you check the water pressure?

09:38.940 --> 09:41.590
- Excellent.
- That was hard to get.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.359
You know if you quit smoking,

09:46.360 --> 09:47.719
you'd look, like, 10 years younger.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.600
Why would I want to
look 10 years younger?

09:55.550 --> 09:57.947
This neighbourhood is nice.

09:57.948 --> 09:59.722
You like what you see?

09:59.723 --> 10:02.057
It's good to have many lovers.

10:02.058 --> 10:03.523
It keeps you limber.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.268
But you have to know, we are
different from these people.

10:08.269 --> 10:10.699
Things they take for granted:

10:10.700 --> 10:13.999
package holidays, car in drive,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.519
date nights on sofa.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.480
We can't have these things.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.600
Winners win alone.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.740
You can't go down that path anymore.

10:29.470 --> 10:31.122
I dealt with it.

10:31.123 --> 10:32.747
Ah. Hmm.

10:32.748 --> 10:34.562
So, you don't think about her anymore?

10:34.563 --> 10:36.630
- I dealt with it!
- Mm-hm.

10:37.790 --> 10:39.840
Okay.

10:39.850 --> 10:41.919
So, the job went well, they're happy,

10:41.920 --> 10:43.308
they're very happy with you.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.160
And I appreciated the homage to Dasha.

10:46.170 --> 10:48.042
I improved an untouchable relic.

10:48.043 --> 10:50.682
- Original's always best.
- Come on!

10:50.683 --> 10:52.202
The paprika was kind of fun.

10:52.203 --> 10:54.802
- I'd have gone turmeric, but...
- So, what do they do now?

10:54.803 --> 10:56.907
Do they send me a letter
of promotion or something?

10:56.908 --> 10:59.482
They want you to work
with somebody first.

10:59.483 --> 11:00.722
What are you talking about?

11:00.723 --> 11:03.562
You have to show them
that you're up to the job.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.419
He's a new recruit.

11:05.420 --> 11:10.479
You will be overseeing him.
You will be giving him orders.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.039
If you want more control,

11:12.040 --> 11:13.882
you have to show them
you have some judgement.

11:13.883 --> 11:15.630
I know.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.899
Carolyn? Carolyn...

11:30.900 --> 11:32.890
Your blouse is, uh...

11:34.650 --> 11:36.170
I like it like that.

11:40.220 --> 11:41.610
Morning!

11:44.370 --> 11:45.803
So...

11:46.660 --> 11:49.319
Shall we just dive right in?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.803
Maybe we should start with
the report on Agent...

11:51.804 --> 11:54.799
Carolyn! We weren't... expecting...

11:54.800 --> 11:59.239
Well, we certainly weren't
expecting you... so soon.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.643
Why ever not?

12:02.540 --> 12:04.159
Well...

12:04.160 --> 12:06.100
How bloody gallant of you.

12:07.010 --> 12:08.403
- Mina?
- Roger...

12:10.840 --> 12:14.602
- Your FSB intelligence...
- Your Volgograd asset...

12:17.563 --> 12:20.283
- Are we looking at a honey trap...
- Regarding the Daesh Takfiri terror cell,

12:20.284 --> 12:22.239
are we talking about fully formed...

12:22.240 --> 12:23.499
- What travel arrangements... ?
- ... high-level targets... ?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.163
Let's all just...

12:25.164 --> 12:27.360
... take five.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.240
It's too soon.

12:31.243 --> 12:33.039
For what?

12:33.040 --> 12:35.399
You're... on leave.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.720
Surely, that's my decision.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.079
I know returning to work
is a welcome distraction.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.599
I don't believe in distractions.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.760
I'm fully capable of doing my job,

12:46.770 --> 12:49.220
without any approval from you.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.239
I know you think I'm
a self-serving prick.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.080
And... well, maybe I am.

12:58.730 --> 13:04.179
But, Carolyn, your son has just died.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.900
Some things are bigger than
the job, and this is one of them.

13:09.850 --> 13:14.279
You have to start taking
care of yourself right now.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.700
Or it's going to catch up with you.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.842
- Your name?
- Jeffrey.

13:33.843 --> 13:35.519
Can you give me the
status of the situation?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.099
Why are you never the same person?

13:37.100 --> 13:38.149
We work on rota.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.239
It's like seeing a new
doctor every time.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.882
I have to explain everything
from the beginning.

13:42.883 --> 13:45.522
Can you please look in
your notes or something?

13:45.523 --> 13:48.039
Do you have my airline tickets?

13:48.040 --> 13:50.919
They want you to stay
in London a bit longer.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.359
Is that really necessary?

13:52.360 --> 13:54.199
They need you to keep an eye on things.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.122
That old MI6 friend of yours.

13:56.123 --> 13:58.739
- How long do I have to stay?
- No idea.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.442
That's very useful. Thank you.

14:00.443 --> 14:02.642
Treat it as a working holiday.

14:02.643 --> 14:04.363
Holiday, you need sunshine.

14:14.030 --> 14:15.189
- _
- Mm.

14:15.190 --> 14:17.680
_

14:39.770 --> 14:41.610
Thirsty work, I imagine.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.149
I worked on a farm.

14:48.150 --> 14:51.963
My father arranged...

15:00.660 --> 15:05.799
Both you and I know perfectly
well that... Kenny...

15:05.800 --> 15:08.299
... didn't take his own life.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.920
Yes.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.859
But I have to be...

15:14.860 --> 15:16.919
... discreet.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.860
I can't... let people know
I'm looking into things.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.159
You were potentially the last
person to speak to him properly

15:25.160 --> 15:26.840
and it's imperative we talk.

15:26.850 --> 15:30.679
Carolyn, I would do anything
for Kenny to be alive

15:30.680 --> 15:34.082
and I am sorry you are
going through this, I am.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.330
But I don't work for you anymore.

15:37.883 --> 15:40.010
Not after what you did in Rome.

15:42.730 --> 15:45.683
I have something that I
think may interest you.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.719
An agitator in Catalonia,
killed in her own shop.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.519
No-one's claimed it.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.840
She hasn't been active for months.

16:12.850 --> 16:15.699
Not since Rome.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.740
We actually thought she was dead.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.920
She's back, Eve.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.280
And she's working.

16:28.523 --> 16:30.170
I can't help you.

16:38.850 --> 16:40.690
I thought you'd want to know.

17:34.123 --> 17:36.919
So, who am I working with on this thing?

17:36.920 --> 17:39.659
Felix Telep.

17:39.660 --> 17:42.079
They say he has real potential.

17:42.080 --> 17:46.719
And I just watch him
and give him a grade?

17:46.720 --> 17:49.659
A: for excellent killing.
B: could do better.

17:49.660 --> 17:51.799
- That kind of thing?
- You don't grade him.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.279
You guide him.

17:53.280 --> 17:57.079
Make sure his plan is clean,
his character work is strong.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.940
You know, just like I
used to do with you.

17:58.950 --> 18:01.519
- What if he's totally useless?
- Then encourage him.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.559
You tell him he's great.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.279
You tell him you know he can do it.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.739
You make him believe he can be good.

18:06.740 --> 18:08.719
Why can't I just do the
work and he watch?

18:08.720 --> 18:11.762
- So much easier.
- Management is not easy.

18:11.763 --> 18:14.099
It's watching someone
do job worse than you.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.999
That's why it sucks.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.160
But to be Keeper, that takes
patience and responsibility.

18:22.170 --> 18:23.179
You need both.

18:23.180 --> 18:24.962
I don't have both. I have neither.

18:24.963 --> 18:27.000
Then pretend that you have!

18:29.010 --> 18:30.799
Come on, look around you, Villanelle.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.359
They don't give places
like this to anybody.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.739
Money, rewards, lifestyle,

18:35.740 --> 18:39.820
it all gets better and better,
the more you succeed.

18:43.930 --> 18:45.610
I believe in you.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.603
So, it's that kind of thing.

18:53.770 --> 18:55.682
Exactly.

18:55.683 --> 18:56.999
Hmm.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.883
_

19:46.000 --> 19:48.880
_

19:50.880 --> 19:53.403
_

20:06.720 --> 20:08.879
Hello? Eve?

20:08.880 --> 20:12.119
Eve, if this is you, don't speak.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.959
You've stolen a dead man's phone
with highly sensitive information,

20:15.960 --> 20:19.039
a phone we're tracking right now.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.599
We both know you've got the phone,

20:20.600 --> 20:22.439
with no way for you to unlock it.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.320
So, why don't you just stop dicking
around with this elusive crap?

20:25.323 --> 20:27.483
Just bring it in and we can...

20:36.720 --> 20:39.283
_

20:44.400 --> 20:48.203
_

20:51.040 --> 20:53.639
How did you know I had the phone?

20:53.640 --> 20:56.699
Oh, that was bollocks.
We just guessed it was you.

20:56.700 --> 20:57.709
What?!

20:57.710 --> 20:59.719
Well, the police didn't
find Kenny's work phone.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.479
You were the last person here.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.170
It's pretty straightforward.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.240
She's here.

21:08.820 --> 21:11.323
Just give the phone to Bear.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.923
I'm not giving it to anyone.
The phone stays with me.

21:18.850 --> 21:20.522
Why'd you nick it?

21:20.523 --> 21:23.962
I didn't nick anything. I just...
forgot to mention I found it.

21:23.963 --> 21:25.562
What was Kenny working
on before he died?

21:25.563 --> 21:26.643
You tell me.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.279
- I asked you.
- Why did you hire him?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.719
MI6. Whiz online.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.239
Integrity.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.059
He was a triple threat.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.039
You didn't want him to look
into anything specific?

21:37.040 --> 21:38.599
I don't tell people what to investigate.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.019
They work on what's important to them.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.629
And Kenny didn't say
what is important to him?

21:41.630 --> 21:42.643
What's important to you?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.039
See, this isn't about me.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.639
See, that's where I think you're wrong.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.283
If it wasn't about you,
you wouldn't have the phone.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.999
Look, two options here.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.882
Either you keep it,

21:55.883 --> 21:57.479
with no way of cracking into it,

21:57.480 --> 21:59.499
and Kenny's death grows
colder by the hour,

21:59.500 --> 22:02.100
or you hand it over and we get going.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.082
I want the files he was working on.

22:11.083 --> 22:13.699
There's no way I'm handing
over classified information

22:13.700 --> 22:14.800
without seeing that phone.

22:14.803 --> 22:17.402
Yeah, well, this phone isn't
free, so where's his laptop?

22:17.403 --> 22:19.243
Every device is clean.
We don't store in the cloud.

22:19.244 --> 22:20.919
We work off encrypted thumb drives.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.200
Fine!

22:28.240 --> 22:30.803
As soon as we crack that phone.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.860
Fine.

22:39.830 --> 22:40.869
Le France.

22:40.870 --> 22:46.029
_

22:57.020 --> 22:58.730
I'm Felix.

23:01.290 --> 23:02.930
What are you?

23:04.450 --> 23:06.722
- 10?
- I'm 19.

23:06.723 --> 23:08.199
I'm tough.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.202
- I have five older brothers.
- Wow!

23:10.203 --> 23:12.282
- Five big brothers?
- Yeah.

23:12.283 --> 23:14.402
And I beat the crap out of all of them.

23:14.403 --> 23:16.643
Take off your hat.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.119
Anybody can fight.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.919
It takes a special person to kill.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.562
I've killed, loads of times.

23:30.563 --> 23:32.122
- Bullshit!
- There was this kid

23:32.123 --> 23:33.242
that bullied me in school.

23:33.243 --> 23:35.119
- Textbook. Basic.
- His sister.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.609
- His father.
- I'm falling asleep here.

23:36.610 --> 23:39.479
His cousin. Best friend, uncle,

23:39.480 --> 23:41.123
dance teacher and grandma.

23:44.980 --> 23:46.440
They were in the same car.

23:52.763 --> 23:55.842
Just so you know, I'm kind of
a big deal in this industry.

23:55.843 --> 23:57.879
- Okay.
- You do everything I say,

23:57.880 --> 23:59.899
- exactly when I say it.
- Okay.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.520
If you make me look
bad, I will kill you.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.879
- O... Okay.
- Okay.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.380
Great talk. Good skills.

24:07.483 --> 24:09.520
Excellent work.

24:10.763 --> 24:12.603
The travel is what I'm
most excited about.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.919
I love hotels.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.322
Well, make sure you ask for first-class.

24:18.323 --> 24:20.319
None of this "submit
receipts after" bullshit.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.160
They should pay up-front.

24:22.163 --> 24:24.300
Okay.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.923
That kid bullied you bad, huh?

24:31.360 --> 24:33.079
He beat up my boyfriend.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.200
You did all that for a boyfriend?!

24:36.203 --> 24:38.359
Well, I was in love.

24:42.970 --> 24:45.619
After everything I did,

24:45.620 --> 24:47.200
he didn't want to know.

24:51.043 --> 24:54.959
When you love somebody and
they don't love you back,

24:54.960 --> 24:59.260
it's... it's worse than...

25:00.900 --> 25:02.299
I don't know what it's worse than,

25:02.300 --> 25:05.789
- but it's really...
- Shit.

25:05.790 --> 25:07.120
Yeah.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.200
Shit.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.100
- Sorry...
- Oh, it's okay.

25:35.540 --> 25:37.159
Oh, hi.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.899
Ah, it's you!

25:39.900 --> 25:42.619
- Good to see you again!
- You too.

25:42.620 --> 25:45.139
I'm sorry I didn't get to say
goodbye after the funeral.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.629
Ah, that's okay.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.999
There was just so much going
on, and I'm hyper-empathic,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.219
so I get over-burdened with
other people's emotions,

25:51.220 --> 25:54.360
which can be... a lot
to process, you know?

25:58.220 --> 25:59.803
Staying in England long?

25:59.804 --> 26:01.940
Undecided.

26:01.950 --> 26:04.719
I have some work I need to finish.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.659
I was just sending this
to my daughter in Russia.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.339
Oh, that's adorable.

26:09.340 --> 26:11.219
I used to collect those
when I was a kid.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.399
Ah.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.539
She's too old for them, really.

26:14.540 --> 26:17.479
Mum used to bring me and Kenny
small bottles of booze.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.779
She says you only know a country
once you know its drink.

26:25.030 --> 26:26.559
You should have this.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.299
Oh, your daughter...

26:28.300 --> 26:29.843
Oh, she wouldn't even notice.

26:29.844 --> 26:31.310
Please.

26:36.310 --> 26:37.820
Thank you.

26:40.430 --> 26:41.780
Oh, no...

26:43.070 --> 26:44.739
I didn't want to upset you.

26:44.740 --> 26:46.430
You haven't. It's just...

26:48.110 --> 26:51.363
Moments of kindness
mean a lot right now.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.739
Bonjour !

27:07.640 --> 27:10.239
Papa! Papa! Papa!

27:10.240 --> 27:12.239
No manners.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.003
That's the target.

27:22.004 --> 27:23.563
_

27:25.400 --> 27:27.159
Merci.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.483
_

27:33.950 --> 27:35.230
_

27:35.750 --> 27:37.430
_

27:42.480 --> 27:43.659
There he goes.

27:43.660 --> 27:44.999
Stick to the plan.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.799
- Okay.
- Behind the ear.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.579
- Okay.
- Clean and clinical.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.379
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.159
Okay, go. Now!

28:58.280 --> 28:59.442
What happened to the plan?

28:59.443 --> 29:01.399
I improvised.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.119
Oh?

29:09.580 --> 29:12.360
Oh, management sucks.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.999
This is everything
I could find right now.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.243
The rest is gonna take more time.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.949
Audrey.

29:25.950 --> 29:28.540
- Who's Audrey?
- That's Audrey.

29:30.780 --> 29:32.679
Did you know?

29:32.680 --> 29:36.300
Yeah. He had started wearing deodorant.

29:37.290 --> 29:40.219
It's good to know he was
getting some before he died.

29:40.220 --> 29:41.639
What?!

29:41.640 --> 29:44.019
It's good to know.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.879
Uh, what else is on there?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.479
The rest is gonna take a while.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.739
He... he knew what he was doing.

29:48.740 --> 29:51.400
- Well, how long is a while?
- A few days.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.140
Okay. Well, then, uh,
give me his thumb drive.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.850
The police have it.

29:59.170 --> 30:00.639
Are you serious?!

30:00.640 --> 30:02.683
- It was in his pocket.
- Oh!

30:04.320 --> 30:05.999
Bastard.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.799
Yeah. No, you're right.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.560
This is never gonna be
solved without you, right?

30:18.020 --> 30:21.779
Maybe we're just clinging to the idea
that something happened to him

30:21.780 --> 30:26.379
because... we're too
afraid of the truth.

30:26.380 --> 30:28.739
That he was just an unhappy kid,

30:28.740 --> 30:30.400
and topped himself.

30:32.170 --> 30:34.400
That's what you really
believe, isn't it?

30:36.680 --> 30:38.920
Or why else would you be walking away?

30:50.930 --> 30:52.730
Audrey?

31:09.530 --> 31:10.699
Uh...

31:10.700 --> 31:12.130
- Oh, hi...
- Hi.

31:13.883 --> 31:16.759
I'm very glad you recognised
me from the, um...

31:16.760 --> 31:18.639
Well, we met at the funeral, didn't we?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.980
- Mm. Yeah.
- Mm.

31:22.930 --> 31:29.920
Um, what I'm keen to
ascertain is... is whether...

31:32.090 --> 31:37.059
What I mean to say is, do you
think that, uh, Kenny, was happy?

31:37.060 --> 31:38.460
Do you think?

31:40.780 --> 31:45.059
He used to sing to himself
when he was on the loo.

31:45.060 --> 31:47.840
S Club 7, mostly.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.960
- And he liked the job?
- Loved it.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.659
He missed you, though.

31:57.660 --> 32:01.140
He said nobody kicked
his arse like you did.

32:06.610 --> 32:08.410
I could be hard on him.

32:11.490 --> 32:14.879
My mum told me I was
brilliant at everything,

32:14.880 --> 32:16.639
even when I wasn't.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.739
I spent four years
trying to be an artist

32:18.740 --> 32:21.060
without any actual talent.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.199
Being hard on someone is
sometimes what they need.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.630
The ancient Celts used to
mourn their loved ones

32:29.640 --> 32:32.199
with wailing and shrieking.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.600
It was just a public ritual for them.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.760
They weren't embarrassed
about it in the least.

32:42.450 --> 32:44.043
Don't be embarrassed, will you?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.800
There you are!

33:12.160 --> 33:14.619
I said...

33:14.620 --> 33:16.510
Can I get in?

33:25.110 --> 33:27.099
Can I turn this... ?

33:27.100 --> 33:28.630
Okay.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.670
Are you coming in to work?

33:34.920 --> 33:37.299
There's no point.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.710
Why?

33:40.720 --> 33:44.630
There's no point coming in because
I'm not allowed to do my work.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.979
And there's no point in going
home because my daughter...

33:49.980 --> 33:54.079
... is taking over the house, wanting...

33:54.080 --> 33:56.439
... to talk.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.590
Well, you can't just sit here.

34:00.910 --> 34:02.390
I can.

34:03.870 --> 34:07.100
I've got my sandwiches. I'm fine.

34:18.739 --> 34:20.719
What a way to go.

34:22.469 --> 34:23.949
Sorry?

34:27.100 --> 34:29.139
What a terrible death.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.418
Dido...

34:36.420 --> 34:39.139
... abandoned by Aeneas...

34:39.139 --> 34:41.150
... dies of grief.

34:45.830 --> 34:47.100
Oh, right.

34:54.710 --> 34:56.389
I can't...

34:57.710 --> 34:59.590
... solve it, Mo.

35:02.150 --> 35:03.950
I can't investigate it.

35:06.630 --> 35:08.310
My hands are tied.

35:14.150 --> 35:15.670
It's my son...

35:21.950 --> 35:26.560
... and I can't... solve it.

35:35.390 --> 35:37.679
I need to speak with Carolyn.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.122
I'm not sure she's really up for...

35:40.123 --> 35:41.643
Mum?

35:42.780 --> 35:43.799
It's all right.

35:51.820 --> 35:55.259
Geraldine, why don't you go and
do your thing, where you...

35:55.260 --> 35:57.819
... close your eyes and breathe?

35:57.820 --> 35:59.242
Do you mean sleep?

35:59.243 --> 36:00.723
Go ahead.

36:05.060 --> 36:08.962
Eve, if you have come here to
berate me about the other day,

36:08.963 --> 36:10.699
do you mind if we do it in the morning?

36:10.700 --> 36:13.080
- I'm a little tired.
- I have Kenny's phone.

36:14.860 --> 36:16.240
I see.

36:16.243 --> 36:19.163
I need to know what
happened, who killed him.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.619
Well...

36:22.620 --> 36:25.079
... as you know...

36:25.080 --> 36:27.059
... in the field, when someone dies,

36:27.060 --> 36:31.950
they can... fuel you, in a good way.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.560
But this is different.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.242
Do you understand?

36:41.243 --> 36:42.990
I understand.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.980
All right.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.310
I miss his smell.

36:58.123 --> 36:59.603
Carolyn...

37:01.190 --> 37:02.619
What do you want from me?

37:02.620 --> 37:04.839
There's a thumb drive he was working on.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.859
The police have it.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.679
We need to get a hold of it.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.419
We need to crack into it.

37:10.420 --> 37:12.430
We'll keep it confidential.

37:18.603 --> 37:21.723
_

37:38.700 --> 37:40.800
Nice place.

37:44.350 --> 37:45.642
No...

37:45.643 --> 37:48.283
- Oh, yes.
- No.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.679
- No.
- No?!

37:50.680 --> 37:51.803
- Really?!
- Aah!

37:51.804 --> 37:54.639
Oh! Oh! No! Stop!

37:54.640 --> 37:57.779
You do not get to come here
without an invitation anymore!

37:57.780 --> 37:59.099
Fine!

37:59.100 --> 38:01.163
Fine.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.640
Can I please come to see you?

38:13.160 --> 38:15.499
Aagh!

38:16.883 --> 38:18.799
I'll think about it.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.340
Ohh...

38:21.350 --> 38:23.440
Oh!

38:24.270 --> 38:26.039
Oh, God...

38:26.040 --> 38:29.239
Oh, I missed you.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.419
- Hmm.
- You look good.

38:31.420 --> 38:33.083
Haven't you heard?

38:33.860 --> 38:35.319
I'm moving up in the world.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.639
Really?

38:37.640 --> 38:38.843
They're making me a Keeper.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.429
- Who told you that?
- Dasha.

38:41.430 --> 38:42.439
- Dasha?
- Mm.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.399
You trust Dasha after
what she did to you?

38:44.400 --> 38:46.602
I trust her more than I trust you.

38:46.603 --> 38:49.083
You always said you
were going to kill her.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.799
If I killed everybody who betrayed me,

38:52.800 --> 38:55.239
there would be nobody left.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.479
You know I had no choice in Rome.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.603
Ah, I hope your family was worth it.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.519
That's up for debate.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.419
Look...

39:04.420 --> 39:07.642
... now you're back with
The Twelve, especially now,

39:07.643 --> 39:09.559
you have to know,

39:09.560 --> 39:10.880
- you're not safe.
- I'm fine.

39:10.883 --> 39:13.082
You think you're in control,
but you are not.

39:13.083 --> 39:14.899
And you think I'm going to listen to you

39:14.900 --> 39:17.443
- after everything that you did?
- Okay, fine.

39:17.444 --> 39:20.599
There's something else.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.519
Eve...

39:22.520 --> 39:24.163
... she is alive.

39:25.860 --> 39:27.779
It's not possible.

39:27.780 --> 39:29.899
I saw her with my own eyes.

39:32.580 --> 39:33.699
I shot her.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.419
When you get angry and run away

39:35.420 --> 39:38.482
without checking if the
person is actually dead...

39:38.483 --> 39:41.119
... miracles happen.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.879
But don't go to London.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.259
I don't want anything to happen to you.

39:51.083 --> 39:52.710
Villanelle?

39:54.520 --> 39:55.599
Villanelle?

39:55.600 --> 39:57.460
Villanelle...

39:58.670 --> 40:00.520
I'm fine.

40:03.430 --> 40:05.600
Really, I'm fine. You should go.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.979
How do you know I'm
back with The Twelve?

40:11.980 --> 40:15.299
'Cause I never stopped working for them.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.039
You know I care about you.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.540
I know you're full of shit.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.430
Can't it be both?

40:28.350 --> 40:29.710
Oh...

40:39.080 --> 40:43.563
