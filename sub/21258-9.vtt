00:01.274 --> 00:04.309
Why'd your last boyfriend
break up with you?

00:04.311 --> 00:05.794
He asked you to choose
between him and Harvey.

00:05.795 --> 00:07.278
Who'd you choose?
- Harvey.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.613
- Because you love him.
- It is not that simple.

00:08.615 --> 00:09.998
You have a boyfriend,
but the one you did

00:09.999 --> 00:11.382
wouldn't share you with him.

00:11.385 --> 00:12.834
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--

00:12.835 --> 00:14.284
Do you love Harvey Specter?!

00:14.287 --> 00:15.420
Mark, if you're married,
why did you agree

00:15.421 --> 00:16.554
to have lunch with me?

00:16.556 --> 00:18.490
I thought it's
just lunch, and--

00:18.492 --> 00:19.975
This hasn't felt like
just lunch, and you know it.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.459
What are you doing here?

00:21.461 --> 00:23.628
I've worked at Columbia
for the past six months.

00:23.630 --> 00:25.163
My fiancé lives in the city,

00:25.165 --> 00:26.564
and I wanted to be with him.

00:26.566 --> 00:28.600
I know how to stop
Frank Gallo from testifying.

00:28.602 --> 00:31.202
But my dad isn't gonna be the
only one who doesn't like it.

00:31.204 --> 00:32.637
- Why not?
- Because it involves

00:32.639 --> 00:34.372
impugning his integrity

00:34.374 --> 00:36.041
and doing it through me.

00:36.043 --> 00:37.042
I'm not going back
to Connecticut

00:37.044 --> 00:38.643
<i>until Saturday.</i>

00:38.645 --> 00:40.278
<i>I'm staying at the Carlyle</i>
<i>for the next two nights.</i>

00:40.280 --> 00:41.446
I want your body
one last time

00:41.448 --> 00:42.647
before I walk down that aisle.

00:42.649 --> 00:44.349
I didn't know if you'd come.

00:44.351 --> 00:47.118
I can't do this.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.553
I didn't know if you'd come.

00:48.555 --> 00:50.121
How could I not?

01:04.137 --> 01:08.606
- What?
- I said, shame.

01:10.544 --> 01:16.414
All: Shame, shame,
shame, shame

01:16.416 --> 01:22.253
shame, shame, shame, shame,

01:22.255 --> 01:28.226
shame, shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame,

01:28.228 --> 01:33.131
shame, shame, shame, shame,

01:33.133 --> 01:39.237
shame, shame,
shame, shame, shame,

01:39.239 --> 01:44.375
shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame--

01:45.312 --> 01:46.711
Thank God you are here.

01:46.713 --> 01:48.246
I need to call Lipschitz
right now and tell him

01:48.248 --> 01:49.481
I can't make it today,
I'm sick.

01:49.483 --> 01:50.582
What do you mean,
you're sick?

01:50.584 --> 01:52.350
I mean I'm deathly ill.

01:52.352 --> 01:54.252
I can't make it in there
no matter what he says.

01:54.254 --> 01:55.653
Louis, I don't mean
to get up in your business,

01:55.655 --> 01:57.422
but the time you spend
with that man

01:57.424 --> 01:59.124
is the most important part
of your week.

01:59.126 --> 02:00.625
And by your week,
I mean my week.

02:00.627 --> 02:02.727
Okay, I don't care
whose week it is,

02:02.729 --> 02:05.497
I can't see him today.
I'm too busy.

02:05.499 --> 02:07.465
Busy.
I thought you were sick.

02:07.467 --> 02:10.201
I am. Sick and busy. And I
have a desk full of things

02:10.203 --> 02:12.137
I need to get to,
especially this.

02:12.139 --> 02:14.272
You don't even know
what that is.

02:14.274 --> 02:16.341
How dare you.
I know what's going on

02:16.343 --> 02:17.675
with every case on my desk.

02:17.677 --> 02:19.477
And what I know is this case
needs my help.

02:19.479 --> 02:21.246
Now, call Lipschitz
and leave me

02:21.248 --> 02:22.714
to my business
and one more thing:

02:22.716 --> 02:24.215
take "Game of Thrones"
off my to-do list

02:24.217 --> 02:25.617
for the rest of its run.

02:28.522 --> 02:30.421
Brian, I'm sure
you're doing just fine

02:30.423 --> 02:31.756
on whatever the hell
this case is.

02:31.758 --> 02:33.591
But I just thought I'd check in

02:33.593 --> 02:35.493
and for whatever reason
Gretchen happens to ask,

02:35.495 --> 02:36.761
you tell her that's exactly
what I did.

02:36.763 --> 02:38.363
Okay? Good talk.

02:38.365 --> 02:40.265
Actually,
there's a problem with it.

02:40.267 --> 02:42.267
And I could really
use your help.

02:42.269 --> 02:44.769
- What's the problem?
- It's our nipples.

02:44.771 --> 02:46.604
They're almost
exactly the same.

02:46.606 --> 02:48.773
- Our what now?
- Our client, Perfect Baby.

02:48.775 --> 02:50.608
Yes, those kind of nipples.

02:50.610 --> 02:52.710
Not the nipples that I was just
this morning--

02:52.712 --> 02:55.346
Never mind.
Uh, what were you saying?

02:55.348 --> 02:57.248
There's an overlap
between our pacifier

02:57.250 --> 02:59.384
and the pacifier Sweetie Pie
Baby's about to take to market.

02:59.386 --> 03:00.618
I notified them, but they're
giving me the runaround.

03:00.620 --> 03:02.487
So I thought maybe
if you called--

03:02.489 --> 03:03.688
Wait, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean runaround?

03:03.690 --> 03:05.423
I've been trying
to set a meeting

03:05.425 --> 03:07.325
for almost two months,
but they keep pushing.

03:07.327 --> 03:08.726
Son of a bitch! We need to
get over there right away.

03:08.728 --> 03:10.595
- What? Why?
- Because if we notify them

03:10.597 --> 03:12.497
of overlap, but don't follow up
within 60 days,

03:12.499 --> 03:14.232
we lose the right to sue
them for patent infringement.

03:14.234 --> 03:15.733
- Oh, my God.
- Exactly. Now let's go

03:15.735 --> 03:17.402
tell these assholes if they
think they're gonna

03:17.404 --> 03:18.570
rip our nipples off
without a fight,

03:18.572 --> 03:21.272
they got another thing coming.

03:23.543 --> 03:25.276
What are you doing in here,
Mike?

03:25.278 --> 03:26.811
I haven't had a chance to enjoy

03:26.813 --> 03:29.247
my morning latte in weeks.

03:29.249 --> 03:30.582
You seen this morning's
"Journal"?

03:30.584 --> 03:32.283
There's a new Deputy AG.

03:32.285 --> 03:34.252
He's won 15 cases in a row.

03:34.254 --> 03:36.387
He's making it his mission
to clean up Wall Street.

03:36.389 --> 03:37.689
What does that have to do
with us?

03:37.691 --> 03:39.224
You're gonna take him on.

03:39.226 --> 03:40.558
Excuse me?

03:40.560 --> 03:41.726
You're gonna pick a fight
with this guy,

03:41.728 --> 03:43.661
and you're gonna
clean his clock.

03:43.663 --> 03:45.830
Mike, I appreciate your
confidence in my ability,

03:45.832 --> 03:48.399
but... what exactly
is going on here?

03:48.401 --> 03:50.235
Harvey, when I got back here,

03:50.237 --> 03:51.703
you set out to show the world
that you're not Jessica.

03:51.705 --> 03:53.838
And three seconds later, I put
you on the defensive,

03:53.840 --> 03:55.406
and you've been there
ever since.

03:55.408 --> 03:57.242
- Mike--
- Just listen to me.

03:57.244 --> 03:58.776
Jordan might've been one
of the best defensive players

03:58.778 --> 04:00.445
of all time, but that's not
what people remember him for.

04:00.447 --> 04:01.512
So you're telling me
it's time

04:01.514 --> 04:03.281
to put the ball in my hands.

04:03.283 --> 04:04.682
I'm telling you that you
take on this hotshot,

04:04.684 --> 04:06.351
you show the world that you
can take on anyone.

04:06.353 --> 04:07.785
That's a great idea, Mike,

04:07.787 --> 04:09.721
but the only problem is,
he's not coming after

04:09.723 --> 04:11.789
any of our clients, and I hope
you're not suggesting

04:11.791 --> 04:13.691
we put one of them
on his radar.

04:13.693 --> 04:15.693
I'm saying we sign a client
that's already on his radar.

04:15.695 --> 04:17.629
Why the hell didn't you
say that in the first place?

04:17.630 --> 04:19.564
I didn't need to, 'cause
I already signed them.

04:19.565 --> 04:21.466
Then I guess we pay this
jerkoff a visit

04:21.468 --> 04:25.370
and let him know his winning
streak just came to an end.

04:56.837 --> 04:58.470
[]You know, I was thinking
about joining

04:58.472 --> 04:59.738
a place like this.

05:00.243 --> 05:01.625
The truth is,

05:01.826 --> 05:03.408
I've never been a fan of
losers sweating together

05:03.411 --> 05:05.494
in a confined space.
- Unless it's in a courtroom

05:05.495 --> 05:07.578
and you're the one
making them sweat.

05:07.581 --> 05:09.681
I see my reputation
precedes me.

05:09.683 --> 05:11.750
Well, I'm aware of your
reputation now, Specter.

05:11.752 --> 05:13.685
So why don't you tell me what
the hell you're doing here?

05:13.687 --> 05:15.821
Then you're also aware that
I don't like to waste my time

05:15.823 --> 05:17.489
or my client's money.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.724
So why don't you drop
your bullshit case

05:18.726 --> 05:20.559
against Elmont Investments
right now?

05:20.561 --> 05:21.593
Since when are you
representing

05:21.595 --> 05:22.861
Elmont Investments?

05:22.863 --> 05:24.630
Since they realized
they were being

05:24.632 --> 05:25.898
railroaded by a showboater
and that they needed

05:25.900 --> 05:27.499
a real lawyer to put him
in his place.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.901
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.

05:28.903 --> 05:30.736
Well, it looks to me
you had to bring

05:30.738 --> 05:32.171
your little buddy here
because you're too scared

05:32.173 --> 05:33.705
to go up against me
by yourself.

05:33.707 --> 05:35.541
Yeah, he's not really
scared of anyone.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.142
And for your information,
until about 10 minutes ago,

05:37.144 --> 05:38.777
he had no idea who you were.

05:38.779 --> 05:40.879
Bullshit. He knows
exactly who I am.

05:40.881 --> 05:42.714
We worked in the same
damn office for three years

05:42.716 --> 05:44.183
What?

05:44.185 --> 05:46.185
What the hell
are you talking about?

05:46.187 --> 05:48.454
You really don't remember me,
do you?

05:48.456 --> 05:49.922
No, I don't.

05:49.924 --> 05:52.157
Well let me
ring a bell for you.

05:52.159 --> 05:54.726
My name is Andrew Malik.

05:54.728 --> 05:56.662
And while you were kissing
Cameron Dennis's ass

05:56.664 --> 05:58.764
working on high profile cases,
I was three doors down,

05:58.766 --> 06:00.165
working till two in the morning

06:00.167 --> 06:01.800
putting the real
criminals away.

06:01.802 --> 06:04.536
And you may not have
remembered me then,

06:04.538 --> 06:07.239
but you're sure as hell
going to remember me now.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.609
<i>[foreboding music]</i>

06:12.746 --> 06:14.680
What are you doing in here?

06:14.682 --> 06:15.848
Nothing. Harvey asked me

06:15.850 --> 06:16.849
to put this on Cameron's desk.

06:16.851 --> 06:18.517
Of course he did.

06:18.519 --> 06:20.152
Cameron and Harvey
are like father and son.

06:20.153 --> 06:21.786
And you and Harvey are like--

06:21.789 --> 06:24.223
Well, you know what.
- No, I don't, actually.

06:24.225 --> 06:25.958
Why don't you tell me?
- Forget it.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.826
I'm not gonna
forget it, Andy.

06:27.828 --> 06:29.561
And I'm not gonna let you
make a false accusation

06:29.563 --> 06:30.662
like that and get away with it.

06:30.664 --> 06:32.164
How about this accusation?

06:32.166 --> 06:33.966
It's past eight,
and I'm still here working.

06:33.968 --> 06:35.567
Cameron will never see that
because he's probably out

06:35.569 --> 06:37.269
getting a drink with your boss.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.837
Well then maybe you should
realize that working hard

06:38.839 --> 06:40.205
isn't the only thing
that matters in life.

06:40.207 --> 06:41.273
No, what should
matter is that

06:41.275 --> 06:42.774
you care about what you do.

06:42.776 --> 06:44.610
And Cameron loves Harvey.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.245
So he can't see the truth
that's in front of his face.

06:46.247 --> 06:48.213
And what truth is that?

06:48.215 --> 06:50.182
That there is no way that
Harvey Specter

06:50.184 --> 06:51.850
will be here forever.

06:51.852 --> 06:53.585
Well, I'll be here forever.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.853
And I don't care
how tight they are

06:54.855 --> 06:56.722
or how tight
the two of you are.

06:56.724 --> 06:59.291
I will outlast you all
as a prosecutor.

07:03.697 --> 07:04.930
There you are.

07:04.932 --> 07:05.931
I was looking all over for you.

07:05.933 --> 07:07.799
What for?

07:07.801 --> 07:11.236
Well I know you were being
a little secretive

07:11.238 --> 07:12.704
about your date last night.

07:12.706 --> 07:14.206
But I care about you

07:14.208 --> 07:16.608
and I wanted to know
how it went.

07:18.245 --> 07:19.878
It didn't.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.613
- But you said--
- I know what I said.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.950
I wanted a night to just
feel good about myself.

07:24.952 --> 07:27.553
But I realized that last night
wasn't gonna do that.

07:27.555 --> 07:28.754
So I called it off.

07:28.756 --> 07:31.223
Oh, sorry.

07:31.225 --> 07:32.591
You wanna talk about it?

07:32.593 --> 07:35.561
No, Rachel. I don't.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.301
I'm sorry, I think you have
the wrong office.

07:42.303 --> 07:43.569
Oh, we're in
the right office.

07:43.571 --> 07:44.903
In fact, we were supposed to

07:44.905 --> 07:46.004
meet three weeks ago,
but you asked

07:46.006 --> 07:47.773
to reschedule and never did.

07:47.775 --> 07:49.641
You're from Pearson Specter.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.343
Pearson Specter Litt.
And according to Brian,

07:51.345 --> 07:53.312
he's been trying to meet
with you for quite some time.

07:53.314 --> 07:55.314
Yes, we've been
a bit busy, so--

07:55.316 --> 07:57.015
Yeah, busy trying to douche
our client out of their money.

07:57.017 --> 07:58.750
And if you think
we're letting you

07:58.752 --> 08:00.052
go to market with your
rip-off nipple,

08:00.054 --> 08:01.620
you're even dumber
than the babies

08:01.622 --> 08:02.854
that buy your crappy diapers.

08:02.856 --> 08:04.356
We're not shelving
our new product.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.891
In that case,
we'll take you to court,

08:05.893 --> 08:07.726
and it'll end up
being shelved anyway.

08:07.728 --> 08:08.794
Or you can admit
you infringed on our design

08:08.796 --> 08:10.062
and cut us in for 60%.

08:10.064 --> 08:11.997
We didn't infringe
on anything

08:11.999 --> 08:13.799
and if you think we did
then you don't know a thing

08:13.801 --> 08:15.701
about the market you represent.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.636
Not know the market?

08:17.638 --> 08:19.004
For your information,
I've got a newborn.

08:19.006 --> 08:20.772
And if it weren't
for our pacifiers,

08:20.774 --> 08:22.274
I wouldn't have gotten
what little sleep

08:22.276 --> 08:23.942
I have in the last month.
- Then I guess

08:23.944 --> 08:25.877
you're an even shittier father
than you are a lawyer

08:25.879 --> 08:28.714
because if you can't put a baby
down without a pacifier,

08:28.716 --> 08:30.949
then you don't have a chance
in hell against us in court.

08:30.951 --> 08:32.951
- What did you just say?
- I said you don't know

08:32.953 --> 08:35.386
what you're doing
as a father or a lawyer.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.655
How dare you.
I don't give a shit

08:37.658 --> 08:38.756
what you think.

08:38.759 --> 08:40.058
We're not taking 60%.

08:40.059 --> 08:41.727
We're gonna sue your ass
into the ground.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.328
And as soon as I
get back to my office,

08:43.330 --> 08:45.097
I'm filing a restraining order
to stop you

08:45.099 --> 08:46.965
from ever taking your
fraudulent product to market,

08:46.967 --> 08:50.002
you lying sack of shit.

08:50.004 --> 08:53.005
<i>[tense music]</i>

08:53.007 --> 08:57.843
<i>♪ ♪</i>

08:57.845 --> 09:00.746
All right, why don't you
say what's on your mind?

09:00.748 --> 09:02.381
Who says there's anything
on my mind?

09:02.383 --> 09:04.082
There's always something
on your mind.

09:04.084 --> 09:05.851
The only time it doesn't
pop right out of your mouth

09:05.853 --> 09:07.653
is when you're not sure
you should say it.

09:07.655 --> 09:09.087
Look, I was just thinking
if I'd known there was

09:09.089 --> 09:10.822
a personal history
with this guy,

09:10.824 --> 09:11.990
I wouldn't have
picked this case.

09:11.992 --> 09:13.659
Yeah, if I'd known there was

09:13.661 --> 09:14.760
a personal history
with this guy,

09:14.762 --> 09:15.861
you wouldn't have had to.

09:15.863 --> 09:17.095
Harvey, listen to me.

09:17.097 --> 09:18.730
I took on the prison case

09:18.732 --> 09:19.998
and it almost ripped us apart.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.733
I took on this
to make up for that.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.934
I don't want it
to do the same thing.

09:22.936 --> 09:24.069
What makes you think you know

09:24.071 --> 09:25.737
what this case is gonna do?

09:25.739 --> 09:27.105
I don't know exactly
what it's gonna do.

09:27.107 --> 09:28.840
But I know it's personal
with this guy

09:28.842 --> 09:30.142
and that never ends well.

09:30.144 --> 09:31.877
You still have time to get out.

09:31.879 --> 09:33.378
Mike's right, Harvey.

09:33.380 --> 09:34.880
You do not wanna
go up against this man.

09:34.882 --> 09:35.981
I don't even remember
this guy.

09:35.983 --> 09:37.449
You expect me to run scared?

09:37.451 --> 09:39.451
Well I remember him.
You acted like

09:39.453 --> 09:41.386
he didn't
exist for three years.

09:41.388 --> 09:43.355
But he is sneaky and he is
conniving and now he's got

09:43.357 --> 09:45.023
the power of the AG's office
behind him.

09:45.025 --> 09:46.358
I don't care
what office he has.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.126
The only reason he remembers me

09:48.128 --> 09:51.129
and I don't remember him
is he sucked and I was awesome.

09:51.131 --> 09:53.765
And if you're telling me
that between then and now

09:53.767 --> 09:56.702
I've stalled and he's
skyrocketed, I'm not buying it.

09:56.704 --> 09:59.037
I think what Donna's
trying to say is that this guy

09:59.039 --> 10:02.040
is like Louis Litt and Elliott
Stemple rolled into one.

10:02.042 --> 10:03.709
And if you can avoid
a fight with him,

10:03.711 --> 10:05.410
you should.
- Well, I can't

10:05.412 --> 10:07.079
avoid a fight with him
because we just picked one.

10:07.081 --> 10:09.815
And despite what
you both seem to think,

10:09.817 --> 10:11.116
I can handle him.

10:11.118 --> 10:14.386
Well, you're gonna
get your chance.

10:14.388 --> 10:18.890
'Cause he just subpoenaed
our new client.

10:18.892 --> 10:20.192
Louis, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean

10:20.194 --> 10:21.927
to fly off the handle
like that.

10:21.929 --> 10:22.928
What are you kidding?
That was the best thing

10:22.930 --> 10:24.162
I've seen in weeks.

10:24.164 --> 10:26.198
So...you're not mad?

10:26.200 --> 10:27.999
Mad? I'm blown away.

10:28.001 --> 10:30.135
It was like watching
a fierce, manly butterfly

10:30.137 --> 10:32.404
emerge from its
pussy little cocoon.

10:32.406 --> 10:33.839
Where the hell
did that Brian come from?

10:33.841 --> 10:35.474
I don't know.
I guess you can say

10:35.476 --> 10:36.475
a lot of things about me,
but when you insult

10:36.477 --> 10:37.943
my ability as a father--

10:37.945 --> 10:39.044
It brings out the lion
in you.

10:39.046 --> 10:40.445
Something like that.

10:40.447 --> 10:42.180
But I promise,
it won't happen again.

10:42.182 --> 10:44.015
But I want it
to happen again.

10:44.017 --> 10:45.817
In fact, when you draft
the restraining order,

10:45.819 --> 10:47.819
I want you picturing
that asshole

10:47.821 --> 10:50.222
laughing to his buddies about
what a shitty father you are.

10:50.224 --> 10:51.523
Think about it when you're
writing the opening,

10:51.525 --> 10:53.492
think about it in the middle,

10:53.494 --> 10:55.026
and definitely think about it
when you write the close.

10:55.028 --> 10:56.828
Because Mufasa Brian
is the only Brian

10:56.830 --> 10:58.230
I want to see from now on.

11:01.168 --> 11:03.235
Let's get on with this.
My client's a busy woman.

11:03.237 --> 11:05.170
Apparently she's too busy
to realize she just hired

11:05.172 --> 11:06.905
a firm that's willing
to sell out their own clients.

11:06.907 --> 11:08.073
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:08.075 --> 11:09.975
Oh, come on.

11:09.977 --> 11:11.843
You must be aware of what
happened with William Sutter.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.445
What happened was Harvey
got him a better deal

11:13.447 --> 11:15.113
than anyone could have
under the circumstances.

11:15.115 --> 11:16.848
Is that what you call
sending him to prison?

11:16.850 --> 11:18.183
A great deal?
- I hope there's more

11:18.185 --> 11:19.785
to your legal strategy
than talking shit

11:19.787 --> 11:21.186
about my firm, Andy.

11:21.188 --> 11:22.454
Oh, I see you asked someone
who I was.

11:22.456 --> 11:23.488
Took a while to find someone

11:23.490 --> 11:24.923
who actually remembered.

11:24.925 --> 11:26.858
Now ask my client
an actual question

11:26.860 --> 11:28.226
or I'm shutting this down
right now.

11:28.228 --> 11:30.095
Okay, here's one:
Mrs. Stanger,

11:30.097 --> 11:32.097
why don't you tell me why
one of your divisions

11:32.099 --> 11:35.867
suddenly needed to be sold
on December 31st at 11:53 p.m.?

11:35.869 --> 11:37.869
We finally got the offer
that we'd been waiting for.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.271
Mm-hmm. An offer worth
8 million less

11:39.273 --> 11:41.072
than the last one.
- Last time I checked,

11:41.074 --> 11:42.908
being a Deputy AG
doesn't make you

11:42.910 --> 11:44.543
an expert
in wholesale shipping.

11:44.545 --> 11:46.144
No, but it sure as hell
makes me an expert

11:46.146 --> 11:47.846
on executives locking in
their bonuses illegally.

11:47.848 --> 11:49.147
- That is not--
- He's baiting you.

11:49.149 --> 11:50.816
Don't respond.
- I'm not baiting.

11:50.818 --> 11:52.083
I'm deposing.
- Then why don't you ask

11:52.085 --> 11:53.885
a goddamn question
based on evidence

11:53.887 --> 11:56.254
and save your speeches
for outside the courthouse?

11:56.256 --> 11:58.089
Did you knowingly
defraud your shareholders

11:58.091 --> 11:59.891
to inflate your own bonus?
- Don't answer that.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.259
Did you inform your
board of directors

12:01.261 --> 12:03.295
that you were taking
a below market offer?

12:03.297 --> 12:05.197
- Don't answer that either.
- Wow, you're getting a lot of,

12:05.199 --> 12:06.998
"Don't answer that question."
I can see why they're

12:07.000 --> 12:08.300
worth the big bucks.
- Listen to me, asshole.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.068
My client's innocent.
And you come at her

12:10.070 --> 12:11.870
with nothing but innuendo,
she's taking the 5th.

12:11.872 --> 12:13.305
Well, let me tell
you something that you

12:13.307 --> 12:15.006
may not know since you
left being a prosecutor:

12:15.008 --> 12:16.975
innocent people
never take the 5th.

12:16.977 --> 12:18.944
And if you try that, I'll put
the criminal case on hold,

12:18.946 --> 12:20.278
I'll bring the board up on
civil charges and believe me,

12:20.280 --> 12:21.947
they will roll
over on her before

12:21.949 --> 12:24.015
I'm finished
offering them the chance.

12:24.017 --> 12:25.050
- Can he do that?
- Yes, I can.

12:25.052 --> 12:26.918
And for the record,

12:26.920 --> 12:27.953
I don't give a shit
if you're innocent or not.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.955
You are going to prison.

12:31.892 --> 12:33.925
How's that for making
an impression, Harvey?

12:41.602 --> 12:43.335
[]Dad.

12:43.337 --> 12:44.803
What are you doing here?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.038
I was in the neighborhood.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.773
I realized I haven't
seen your office

12:47.775 --> 12:49.308
since you became
a member of the bar.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.144
Well, that's sweet but my
office hasn't changed one bit

12:53.147 --> 12:54.179
so why don't you tell me
what you're really doing here?

12:54.181 --> 12:57.149
I came to tell you that was
one hell of a move you made,

12:57.151 --> 13:01.119
using my own daughter against
me with the Reform Corp. case.

13:01.121 --> 13:05.023
I'm not just your daughter.
I'm a lawyer.

13:05.025 --> 13:08.794
That's why I'm here.
I wanna work with you.

13:08.796 --> 13:11.196
- I don't follow.
- Rachel, Frank Gallo

13:11.198 --> 13:13.865
wanted to connect
with his daughter

13:13.867 --> 13:15.233
and waited until
it was too late.

13:15.235 --> 13:17.269
I don't wanna make
that same mistake.

13:17.271 --> 13:19.605
And I appreciate that, Dad.

13:19.607 --> 13:21.239
But I've also made it
really clear

13:21.241 --> 13:23.175
that I wanna make my own way.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.277
Oh, I'm not talking
about you switching firms.

13:25.279 --> 13:27.112
I'm talking about a pro Bono.

13:27.114 --> 13:29.281
Now I know you did one
with Jessica last year,

13:29.283 --> 13:33.218
I thought maybe it was time
you did one with me.

13:33.220 --> 13:36.321
- What kinda case?
- Predatory lending.

13:36.323 --> 13:38.323
Taking advantage of
people of color.

13:38.325 --> 13:42.194
I'd really like that.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.296
But I have to clear it
with Harvey first.

13:44.298 --> 13:46.164
No, you don't.
I told the man I wanted to work

13:46.166 --> 13:49.034
with my family and he said,
"Of course, Robert.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.838
How can I stand
in the way of that?"

13:52.840 --> 13:54.106
Well, in that case.
I think we should

13:54.108 --> 13:56.041
head back to your office
and get ready

13:56.043 --> 13:59.111
to show those bastards what the
team of Zane and Zane can do.

14:00.314 --> 14:02.914
Hey. We need to talk.

14:02.916 --> 14:04.249
No, we don't.
I just got off the phone

14:04.251 --> 14:05.384
with the last board member.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.918
We need to get 'em in a room

14:06.920 --> 14:08.220
and lock 'em down before Malik

14:08.222 --> 14:10.022
gets a chance
to issue subpoenas.

14:10.024 --> 14:11.957
Harvey, you heard him.
It's not gonna be enough.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.191
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that we cut a deal

14:13.193 --> 14:15.661
to pay a fine
while we still can.

14:15.663 --> 14:17.295
- Are you kidding me?
- Listen to me,

14:17.297 --> 14:18.964
I saw the look
on that woman's face.

14:18.966 --> 14:20.932
She did it,
and the board's gonna know it.

14:20.934 --> 14:22.300
The second that
he makes this civil,

14:22.302 --> 14:23.969
they're gonna turn on her,
just like he said.

14:23.971 --> 14:25.303
I get what this is.

14:25.305 --> 14:26.938
What the hell are you
talking about?

14:26.940 --> 14:28.073
You brought me this
to make up

14:28.075 --> 14:29.341
for your pro Bono fixation

14:29.343 --> 14:31.076
messing with my business.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.078
And now you found out
that she's guilty,

14:33.080 --> 14:34.913
so you wanna cut and run 'cause
it goes against your code.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.348
That's bullshit.

14:36.350 --> 14:38.350
I knew she was guilty
the second I signed her.

14:38.352 --> 14:40.085
Harvey, we're not talking about

14:40.087 --> 14:41.453
some chemical company
causing cancer.

14:41.455 --> 14:43.188
We're talking about
one rich person

14:43.190 --> 14:44.956
stealing money from
other rich people.

14:44.958 --> 14:46.391
I'm saying that we cut a deal
because he's got us.

14:46.393 --> 14:48.226
He doesn't have shit
because she didn't

14:48.228 --> 14:49.695
give him anything.
- That doesn't matter to him

14:49.697 --> 14:51.229
and it's not gonna matter
to a jury

14:51.231 --> 14:54.166
because she's guilty
whether we like it or not.

14:54.168 --> 14:56.268
- What did you just say?
- I said she's guilty.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.403

- And the bullet

23:01.910 --> 23:03.076

- Oh, did you misunderstand me,

the assignment you were given?

instructing your team

24:24.192 --> 24:26.225
to sell that division
for whatever it takes.

24:26.227 --> 24:27.961
- No, I didn't.
- Then why the hell

24:27.963 --> 24:30.263
does the "Journal" say you did?

24:33.268 --> 24:35.168
- This is ridiculous.
- Ridiculous because

24:35.170 --> 24:36.936
it isn't true or because
you didn't write it?

24:36.938 --> 24:40.006
- I didn't write it.
- But it is true.

24:40.008 --> 24:42.875
I may have mentioned it would
be in our best interest

24:42.877 --> 24:45.044
if a division was sold
before the end of the year.

24:45.046 --> 24:47.046
But I was never dumb enough
to write it in a memo.

24:47.048 --> 24:48.915
No, you're just dumb enough
to put your interests

24:48.917 --> 24:50.917
in front of your company's.
- I am this company.

24:50.919 --> 24:52.952
Our interests are the same.

24:52.954 --> 24:54.921
Or have you forgotten
what side you're on?

24:54.923 --> 24:56.856
We haven't
forgotten anything.

24:56.858 --> 24:59.325
And we can't defend you if we
don't have all the information.

24:59.327 --> 25:01.294
Well now you have it.
I didn't write the memo.

25:01.296 --> 25:03.896

you were the ones

25:03.898 --> 25:05.798

knocking on my door.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.333
So instead of coming into
my office in the middle

why don't you do your job

- I'm not gonna tell you that.
- Why not?

25:21.997 --> 25:24.145
Because when a client
says they're guilty,

25:24.146 --> 25:26.602
I believe them when they say
that's not the gun they used.

25:26.702 --> 25:28.185
Then what were
you gonna say?

25:28.187 --> 25:29.687
I think he brought us
that paper

25:29.689 --> 25:31.489
to send us on
a wild goose chase,

25:31.491 --> 25:33.023
trying to figure out
where that memo came from.

25:33.025 --> 25:34.558
Why would he wanna do that?

25:34.560 --> 25:36.160
Because he doesn't
actually have it.

25:36.162 --> 25:37.562
And he wanted to take
our eyes off the ball.

25:37.563 --> 25:38.963
I don't get it.
What ball?

25:38.965 --> 25:40.564
The ball that says
he's gonna try and

25:40.566 --> 25:42.266
use that article as evidence
to get the memo

25:42.268 --> 25:44.068
that he doesn't have admitted.
- He can't do that.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.970
The rules of evidence say that
if that thing exists

25:45.972 --> 25:48.639
and he doesn't have it, he
can't even submit a copy of it,

25:48.641 --> 25:50.641
let alone an article
referring to it.

25:50.643 --> 25:52.109
And that, Harvey,
is the ball he's trying

25:52.111 --> 25:54.011
to keep our eyes off of.

25:54.013 --> 25:56.080
That means all we have to do
is show up at court tomorrow

25:56.082 --> 25:58.182
and stop him.
- That's pretty good, Mike.

25:58.184 --> 26:00.050

26:16.536 --> 26:18.769
Okay, let's go over the plan.

admit this came from the top,

26:26.779 --> 26:28.812
we're gonna show that
they did this all on their own.

26:28.814 --> 26:30.314
In which case, we report
them to HUD

26:30.316 --> 26:32.650

in banking again.

26:32.652 --> 26:36.020
- Good.
- Good.

You know, the last time
we worked together

26:43.829 --> 26:46.130
When you helped me
with Model U.N.

referring to.

the reason

29:16.182 --> 29:17.981
that I would like to
have entered that article

29:17.983 --> 29:21.385
is to show the court that that
memo existed and he buried it.

29:23.255 --> 29:24.354

- What's outrageous

29:24.356 --> 29:25.456
is that he's done it before

29:25.458 --> 29:27.191

back up his allegation,

31:41.527 --> 31:43.393
written down doesn't mean
it's not understood.

31:43.395 --> 31:45.929
I've been a loan officer
at Avon for ten years.

31:45.931 --> 31:48.332
Our lending process doesn't
allow for discrimination.

31:48.334 --> 31:50.400
- How is that possible?
- A computer program

31:50.402 --> 31:52.469
strips out race, gender,
and photos

31:52.471 --> 31:54.872
before approval officers
ever see the application.

31:54.874 --> 31:56.974
Bullshit. Then why even
ask for those things

31:56.976 --> 31:58.542
in the first place?
- Because we have to protect

31:58.544 --> 32:00.444
against identity fraud.
- And none of that

32:00.446 --> 32:02.145
stops the boss from telling you
to deny number 512

32:02.147 --> 32:03.647
their rightful mortgage.

32:03.649 --> 32:05.549
Because he's
a predatory piece of shit

32:05.551 --> 32:06.650
and he's using fools
like you to cover his own ass!

32:06.652 --> 32:08.385
- Excuse me?
- Dad.

32:08.387 --> 32:09.620
How can you work
for a man like that?

32:09.622 --> 32:11.521
I would never
work for a place

32:11.523 --> 32:13.156
that engaged in discrimination
and I am more than happy

32:13.158 --> 32:14.925
to say that on the stand.
- Well, you're gonna

32:14.927 --> 32:16.393
get your chance because
something is going on here

32:16.395 --> 32:18.028
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

32:18.030 --> 32:19.429
- We're done here.
- Bullshit, we're done.

32:19.431 --> 32:21.498
We have five more people
to depose.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.166
And they're gonna say the
exact same thing Lisa just did,

32:23.168 --> 32:24.501
but I'm not gonna give you
the chance to treat them

32:24.503 --> 32:26.103
the way you just treated her.

32:26.105 --> 32:27.437
What I am gonna do
is petition the judge

32:27.439 --> 32:29.573
to have this case thrown out.

32:29.575 --> 32:36.647
<i>♪ ♪</i>

32:41.689 --> 32:44.323
[]Don't tell me you still
want me to give up

32:44.325 --> 32:45.591
because even if I wanted to--

32:45.593 --> 32:47.526
That's not what
I'm here to say.

32:47.528 --> 32:49.428
We need to figure out
what case he's talking about.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.530
I know what case. He worked
in the DA's office ten years.

32:51.532 --> 32:53.265
He's talking about
Clifford Danner.

32:53.267 --> 32:55.167
Harvey, that doesn't
make any sense.

32:55.169 --> 32:56.568
You didn't suppress that
evidence, Cameron Dennis did.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.437
Malik doesn't give
a shit about that.

32:58.438 --> 33:00.305
I was the prosecuting attorney.

33:00.307 --> 33:01.640
I should've known what was
happening with my own case,

33:01.642 --> 33:03.175
which means we're screwed.

33:03.177 --> 33:04.610
- Unless--
- Unless what?

33:04.612 --> 33:06.645
Unless we can get
Cameron Dennis to admit

33:06.647 --> 33:08.747
that he buried the evidence and
that you didn't know about it.

33:08.749 --> 33:11.617
Mike, there's no way
Cameron's gonna admit to that.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.387
Wait a second.
- What?

33:15.389 --> 33:17.256
There's also no way
he'd set me up

33:17.258 --> 33:18.657
for something I didn't do.

33:18.659 --> 33:21.226
Which means we need to figure
out how Malik's

33:21.228 --> 33:23.195
gonna make it look like
I suppressed that evidence.

33:23.197 --> 33:25.230
He's gonna subpoena the one
other person who was there

33:25.232 --> 33:27.766
when you put
Clifford Danner away.

33:27.768 --> 33:29.668
- No.
- Yes. He's calling me

33:29.670 --> 33:31.637
to the stand in two days.

33:31.639 --> 33:33.472
Then we need to
get you prepared.

33:33.474 --> 33:35.207
And we need to do it
in front of an audience.

33:35.209 --> 33:36.575
You're talking about
a mock trial?

33:36.577 --> 33:38.410
No way, I'm not putting
Donna through that.

33:38.412 --> 33:40.646
Harvey, Mike's right.

33:40.648 --> 33:41.813
But you're not the one
who has to put me through it,

33:41.815 --> 33:43.682
it has to be Louis.
- Donna,

33:43.684 --> 33:45.517
you know what happened
last time Louis did that.

33:45.519 --> 33:47.819
Yes, I do.
He was brutal.

33:47.821 --> 33:50.255
Which is exactly
what Andy Malik's gonna be.

33:50.257 --> 33:51.723
So either you can
tell Louis or I will.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.592
But either way,
it's gotta be him.

33:53.594 --> 33:55.594
Donna, even if I said yes,

33:55.596 --> 33:58.397
last time Louis did that,
it made him sick.

33:58.399 --> 33:59.698
He's not gonna wanna
do that again.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.301
He won't want to.

34:02.303 --> 34:04.636
But he will.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.542
Well, thanks
for meeting me here.

34:10.543 --> 34:12.444
Well, when you
put off our session,

34:12.446 --> 34:15.447
I knew you must be in the
middle of something important.

34:15.449 --> 34:17.549
That's not why I put it off.

34:17.551 --> 34:19.318
What happened, Louis?

34:19.320 --> 34:20.619
You remember Sheila?

34:20.621 --> 34:22.487
Yeah, of course.

34:22.489 --> 34:24.755
She was the subject
of many of our conversations.

34:24.757 --> 34:27.659
Yeah, well the long and short
of it is she's getting married.

34:27.661 --> 34:29.561
And before she does,
she wanted to have

34:29.563 --> 34:31.429
one last night with me.

34:31.431 --> 34:33.699
And I didn't tell you about it

34:33.701 --> 34:36.534
because I was afraid
that you would judge me.

34:36.536 --> 34:40.739
Louis, it doesn't matter
what I think of your actions.

34:40.741 --> 34:42.507
What do you think?

34:42.509 --> 34:47.379
She said it would free her
to live her life.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.882
And I want her
to be happy with her life,

34:50.884 --> 34:52.884
even if it's not with me.

34:52.886 --> 34:54.753
Then your heart
is in the right place.

34:54.755 --> 34:57.623
Don't you see?
My heart is not the problem.

34:57.625 --> 34:59.691
I can't get her out of my head.

35:01.662 --> 35:04.763
It's Sheila.

35:04.765 --> 35:07.299
It's always been Sheila.

35:07.301 --> 35:10.569
But Louis,
as I recall,

35:10.571 --> 35:12.704
it was you who ended it
with her.

35:12.706 --> 35:15.440
Because I wanted
to have a baby.

35:15.442 --> 35:17.909
And she didn't.

35:17.911 --> 35:20.779
And now I'm not gonna
have anything.

35:20.781 --> 35:25.384
Louis, I understand all that.

35:25.386 --> 35:28.587
But from what Gretchen told me,

35:28.589 --> 35:30.789
I think it's time we
figure out a way

35:30.791 --> 35:34.893
for you to stop lashing out
at those around you.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.900
I thought you went back
to your office.

35:41.902 --> 35:44.770
No, I didn't.
I thought that I would

35:44.772 --> 35:46.638
give you some time
to calm down

35:46.640 --> 35:49.341
and think about
telling me the truth

35:49.343 --> 35:51.743
about what
is going on here.

35:51.745 --> 35:53.545
Nothing's going on.

35:53.547 --> 35:56.648
Dad, you said that you wanted

35:56.650 --> 35:58.717
to be closer with me.

35:58.719 --> 36:03.488
Now's your chance.

36:04.458 --> 36:07.559
This case isn't about
race or money.

36:07.561 --> 36:09.695
That man who heads up this
company is a predator,

36:09.697 --> 36:11.697
through and through.

36:11.699 --> 36:14.399
And I wanted to get him back
for going after

36:14.401 --> 36:16.868
the one person I should've
helped when I had the chance.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.804
But I didn't.

36:18.806 --> 36:20.839
Who?

36:20.841 --> 36:25.844
25 years ago,
that CEO was a branch manager.

36:25.846 --> 36:28.380
Arthur Kitridge.

36:28.382 --> 36:31.450
And your aunt worked for him.

36:31.452 --> 36:33.852
And he made her life
a living hell.

36:33.854 --> 36:35.554
Because she was black?

36:35.556 --> 36:37.756
Because she was beautiful.

36:37.758 --> 36:39.758
He wouldn't leave her alone.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.627
Finally, she threatened
to do something,

36:42.629 --> 36:44.596
and he fired her.

36:44.598 --> 36:46.465
And you didn't help her.

36:46.467 --> 36:49.568
I was a young attorney.

36:49.570 --> 36:51.870
Taking on a case like that

36:51.872 --> 36:53.739
was only gonna
get me fired, too.

36:53.741 --> 36:57.008
So I told her there was
nothing we could do.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.710
And after that...

36:58.712 --> 37:00.979
her life fell apart.

37:00.981 --> 37:03.648
Dad, why didn't you ever
tell me any of this before?

37:03.650 --> 37:05.751
Because she died

37:05.753 --> 37:09.588
a few years later,
and I was ashamed.

37:09.590 --> 37:12.891
And then I watched your fiancé
risk his career

37:12.893 --> 37:14.426
to help those prisoners

37:14.428 --> 37:16.795
and I knew I had
to do something.

37:19.900 --> 37:23.001
You only knew her later.

37:23.003 --> 37:24.903
But if you had seen her before,

37:24.905 --> 37:28.440
smart, beautiful,
full of life...

37:28.442 --> 37:32.677
she could've been
anything she wanted.

37:32.679 --> 37:36.782
Just like you.

37:36.784 --> 37:38.984
I wish I had known her then.

37:38.986 --> 37:43.755
But Dad, I know that whenever
you set your mind to something,

37:43.757 --> 37:46.792
there is nothing
that can stop you.

37:46.794 --> 37:51.663
So I say we take the night
and we regroup.

37:51.665 --> 37:55.467
And tomorrow morning,
we'll find a way.

37:58.605 --> 38:01.840
- Louis, wait.
- Whatever it is, guys,

38:01.842 --> 38:04.042
I can deal with it tomorrow.
It's been an emotional day.

38:04.044 --> 38:06.011
Unfortunately,
it's not over yet.

38:06.013 --> 38:07.646
I've been subpoenaed

38:07.648 --> 38:09.080
by the Attorney General's
office.

38:09.082 --> 38:11.683
What are you talking about?
You have nothing to do

38:11.685 --> 38:12.951
with Harvey's case.
- She doesn't.

38:12.953 --> 38:14.719
But he wants to use her
to prove

38:14.721 --> 38:16.822
that I've suppressed
evidence before

38:16.824 --> 38:18.557
and I'm doing it again.

38:18.559 --> 38:20.592
- Did you?
- No.

38:20.594 --> 38:22.761
Louis, he's gonna question me
about the Clifford Danner case

38:22.763 --> 38:24.629
and try to make it look like
Harvey knew what was going on

38:24.631 --> 38:26.565
and so I must've too.

38:26.567 --> 38:28.033
You know what that means.
I need you to prepare me.

38:28.035 --> 38:29.801
Uh-uh. I don't care.

38:29.803 --> 38:31.002
I can't.
- Louis.

38:31.004 --> 38:33.538
No. Ask Alex to do it,
ask Mike.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.006
It has to be you,
you've done it before.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.808
Which is exactly why
I don't wanna do it again.

38:36.810 --> 38:38.777
I'm not doing that to Donna.
- Louis.

38:38.779 --> 38:41.913
Look, you told me
you did what you did

38:41.915 --> 38:44.749
because Travis Tanner
doesn't give a shit about Donna

38:44.751 --> 38:46.818
and he was gonna come
after her full bore.

38:46.820 --> 38:49.988
Well, this guy has at least
as much of an axe to grind.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.057
And he worked with us
in the D.A.'s office.

38:52.059 --> 38:54.860
Which means he knows
more about us.

38:54.862 --> 38:56.828
And the only way to protect me
is to prepare me

38:56.830 --> 38:58.830
for what's coming.

38:58.832 --> 39:02.133
You are asking me
to go personal again.

39:02.135 --> 39:06.071
And I won't do it.
- No. Louis,

39:06.073 --> 39:09.541
I am asking you to do
whatever you have to do

39:09.543 --> 39:11.576
to protect me again.

39:11.578 --> 39:16.081
And I am telling you
it's okay to do it.

39:16.083 --> 39:20.118
<i>♪ ♪</i>

39:20.120 --> 39:22.754
Okay.

39:22.756 --> 39:25.590
But I'm not gonna do anything
until tomorrow.

39:25.592 --> 39:27.893
Because I need to do
something first.

39:31.131 --> 39:33.098
Donna, what are you
doing here?

39:33.100 --> 39:34.799
I'm ready to tell you about
what happened

39:34.801 --> 39:37.068
on my date the other night.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.004
Well, Mike's still
at the office

39:39.006 --> 39:41.806
and we've got the place
all to ourselves, so...

39:44.745 --> 39:46.678
Do you remember
at Harvey's mock trial

39:46.680 --> 39:50.782
a couple years ago when Louis
asked if I loved Harvey?

39:50.784 --> 39:52.617
How could I not?

39:52.619 --> 39:55.186
And he also asked me about
my last serious boyfriend

39:55.188 --> 39:56.755
and what broke us up.

39:56.757 --> 39:58.790
He asked you to choose

39:58.792 --> 40:01.026
between him and Harvey.

40:01.028 --> 40:03.061
And you wouldn't.

40:03.063 --> 40:05.196
Well, I was thinking about
that old boyfriend recently

40:05.198 --> 40:07.999
and...

40:08.001 --> 40:10.168
I called him and
we went out to lunch.

40:10.170 --> 40:12.103
- And?
- It was wonderful.

40:12.105 --> 40:14.940
Until he told me
he was married.

40:14.942 --> 40:16.641
And I was about to meet him
at a hotel

40:16.643 --> 40:17.809
when I got your text.

40:17.811 --> 40:19.644
And I told him I couldn't.

40:19.646 --> 40:21.079
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this earlier?

40:21.081 --> 40:23.915
I don't know. I guess
maybe I was judging myself

40:23.917 --> 40:26.084
and I was afraid that
you were gonna judge me, too.

40:26.086 --> 40:28.219
- I would never do that.
- I know.

40:28.221 --> 40:30.622
But sometimes it's just
easier to push away the people

40:30.624 --> 40:32.791
who care about you
than tell them the real story.

40:32.793 --> 40:35.694
Well,

40:35.696 --> 40:38.029
you can push me away
as much as you want.

40:38.031 --> 40:40.799
I'll still be here.

40:43.804 --> 40:47.739
Do you regret it?

40:47.741 --> 40:49.674
Regret what?

40:49.676 --> 40:53.712
Putting Harvey over this guy.

40:53.714 --> 40:56.247
[sighs]

40:56.249 --> 40:59.718
I think maybe I regret
putting Harvey over myself.

41:02.723 --> 41:05.056
[knocking]

41:08.729 --> 41:10.161
Louis, what are you
doing here?

41:10.163 --> 41:12.197
It's 11:00 p.m.
- I came because I knew

41:12.199 --> 41:13.865
you were taking the night shift

41:13.867 --> 41:16.735
and since you stayed up
all last night,

41:16.737 --> 41:21.706
I thought you might
need a little relief.

41:21.708 --> 41:24.009
[chuckles] Are you sure?

41:24.011 --> 41:25.810
I am. Though I may need
a little help

41:25.812 --> 41:27.278
with the first half hour.

41:27.280 --> 41:31.016
I don't know, you look like
a natural to me.

41:31.018 --> 41:32.784
You wanna take him?
- Yeah.

41:32.786 --> 41:34.986
Okay. Shh.

41:34.988 --> 41:36.955
Oh, get his head.
- His head, okay.

41:36.957 --> 41:38.890
- You gotta support his head.
- There we go.

41:38.892 --> 41:41.693
Austin, I'd like you
to meet Louis.

41:41.695 --> 41:44.963
Austin, it's so nice
to meet you.

41:44.965 --> 41:47.966
Hey, come in.

41:51.271 --> 41:53.038
Do you really think
I'm gonna be a natural?

41:53.040 --> 41:54.806
Yeah, absolutely.
[door closes loudly]

41:54.808 --> 41:56.875
[baby cries]
- Oh, what do I do?

41:56.877 --> 41:58.109
I don't care.
I'm going to sleep.

41:58.111 --> 41:59.144
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What do I do?

41:59.146 --> 42:00.745
Thank you.

42:00.747 --> 42:03.882
It's gonna be okay.

42:05.252 --> 42:07.786
It's gonna be okay.

42:07.788 --> 42:09.255
