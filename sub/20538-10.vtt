-White flight!

01:25.293 --> 01:26.711
Should we trip her?

01:26.794 --> 01:28.171
Nah. Let it play out.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.298
-What will be will be.
-So Zen.

[Linda grunts]

01:34.719 --> 01:37.847
Fuck! I'm really off of my game today.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.433
Anyone know if Mercury's in retrograde?
[clicks tongue]

01:42.227 --> 01:44.937
I ain't buyin'
the whole Counterfeit Cunt story.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.939
Don't smell right to me.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.651
Hands are too clean for a forger.
She'd be inky.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.736
[gasps] Or maybe she's just
such a good forger,

01:51.819 --> 01:53.280
she went ahead and forged herself.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.157
[scoffs and clicks tongue]

01:55.240 --> 01:56.408
What?

01:58.243 --> 02:00.077
How's she so fast?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.579
Adrenaline and lies.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.598
Yeah, you fully hiding, ain't you?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.225
Fuckin' thermometer planet.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.358
Come on! One more round.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.986
I ain't playing with you no more.
"Gyno" is a word.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.782
It's an abbreviation of a word.

02:37.865 --> 02:40.535
It's not a word in and of itself.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.661
[Frieda] Scrabble rules.

02:41.744 --> 02:46.040
No capitalized words, foreign words,
abbreviations,

02:46.123 --> 02:49.752
or words requiring apostrophes or hyphens.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.128
But this ain't Scrabble.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.423
And what the fuck is X-Y-S-T?

02:53.506 --> 02:56.509
It's an ancient Greek or Roman
covered portico.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.680
-Sounds foreign to me.
-It's an architectural term.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.516
[chuckles softly]

03:03.600 --> 03:06.185
Fine. Forgive me for trying.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.062
I'm getting a migraine.

03:08.145 --> 03:09.772
I'm too baked to focus.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.858
[Frieda] Well, lucky you.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.403
Better bored down here
than up there in The Purge.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.489
[Anita] So you say.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.157
For all we know, it's a party up there.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.076
[Frieda] Then go.

03:23.035 --> 03:25.872
Nah. It's probably The Purge.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.792
Congratulations, Red.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.545
You got me.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.090
Oh, did Mommy not tell you
about her secret plan?

03:37.008 --> 03:38.843
-[groans]
-What was it again, comrade?

03:38.926 --> 03:41.513
You were gonna catfish me
into a mousetrap,

03:41.596 --> 03:43.097
and then what?

03:43.180 --> 03:45.892
Stab me to death
with your sharp Russian wit?

03:45.975 --> 03:49.896
-[Piper grunting]
-You want to talk about half-baked plans?

03:49.979 --> 03:52.940
You've captured six women
in a closet.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.777
Such a big strong man.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.986
[Piper groans]

03:57.069 --> 03:59.864
But what about all those
other little chickens out there, huh?

03:59.947 --> 04:03.451
Ready to pluck your feathers
and rip off your balls?

04:03.535 --> 04:06.288
There are 20 women guarding the hostages.

04:07.204 --> 04:09.666
Three hundred more
are strolling around the hallways,

04:09.749 --> 04:13.378
hungry and bored,
looking for some action.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.923
-[Piper grunting]
-What exactly were you thinking you'd do?

04:17.005 --> 04:18.925
You think I'm here to rescue the hostages?

04:20.718 --> 04:22.929
I've taught my guards
to fend for themselves.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.474
I'm here for you, Reznikov.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.437
And I like an audience when I work,

04:30.520 --> 04:32.439
so I've invited your family here to watch.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.773
[all grunting]

04:33.856 --> 04:35.608
[mumbling in Spanish]
Abominable snow-fuck!

04:35.692 --> 04:38.653
Girls, listen to me. Stay calm.
I'll take care of this.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.863
Come on.
Look, you're not a psycho.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.533
So why don't you just go out there
and rescue your people

04:43.616 --> 04:45.618
like a big, hairless hero,

04:45.702 --> 04:47.329
and then just leave us to lick our wounds.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.456
Well, first...

04:49.539 --> 04:51.958
-I'm going to inflict some...
-[Red groans]

04:52.041 --> 04:53.167
[Piper groans]

04:53.250 --> 04:54.586
...junkie.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.839
And then you can lick away.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.258
-[Piper grunting]
-Go ahead,

05:01.343 --> 05:03.010
make all the noise you want.
No one's gonna hear you.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.554
[muffled] Motherfucker!

05:04.637 --> 05:06.306
[shuddering]

05:06.389 --> 05:07.890
[indistinct chatter]

05:11.728 --> 05:13.855
[inmates clamoring]

05:15.648 --> 05:17.108
Eleven o'clock is lights-out.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.444
We do one last bunk check
before shutting things down.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.988
-What about reading lights?
-Not allowed.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.156
Half these animals are illiterate anyway.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.493
Okay. And should I make sure
the inmates are in their beds?

05:26.576 --> 05:29.120
[chuckles] Just check the doors.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.581
The prison's old,
and they get stuck sometimes.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.249
You take D block.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.042
-I'll do B.
-Yes, sir.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.143
[inmate] I ain't going nowhere.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.440
Oh, shit!

06:03.571 --> 06:05.197
Out of bounds, inmate.
That's a shot.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.910
Don't worry. No one saw.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.290
What's your name, inmate?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.375
Wes Driscoll.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.004
-Fool.
-What was that?

06:20.087 --> 06:22.131
Four, down, "Fool."

06:22.214 --> 06:23.883
Insubordination.
That's another shot.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.301
No, your crossword puzzle.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.806
"Falstaff, Puck, or Bottom."

06:29.889 --> 06:31.223
Bottom?

06:33.768 --> 06:34.769
Yeah.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.771
It's from A Midsummer Night's Dream.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.106
I didn't know it either, but I...
I looked it up.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.746
It feels like it's there,
but then it's not there.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.416
My grandpa lost part of his right leg
in Vietnam,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.627
and he totally felt
like it was still there, too.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.463
But it wasn't a problem.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.048
Except for when he tried
to kick my grandma.

07:04.131 --> 07:06.175
But after a while,
she'd just fake like he got her

07:06.258 --> 07:08.720
-so that she wouldn't hurt his feelings.
-[laughs]

07:08.803 --> 07:10.262
-[gasps] Barbecue chip!
-[gasps]

07:14.684 --> 07:18.771
It's just a bloody piece of human flesh
with a little nail on it.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.567
Oh, my God.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.902
-[gasping]
-It's your fingertip!

07:24.986 --> 07:26.779
-That's my finger!
-Ah!

07:26.863 --> 07:29.532
[Caputo] Underfunded, understaffed...

07:30.533 --> 07:32.076
borderline criminal.

07:32.159 --> 07:33.244
And worst of all,

07:33.327 --> 07:36.372
part of a cynical ploy to jam
hundreds more inmates

07:36.456 --> 07:39.459
into this crumbling turd of a campus,

07:39.542 --> 07:42.670
so that MCC can scam
even more taxpayer dollars.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.672
[Taystee] Ooh!

07:44.756 --> 07:46.508
[Caputo] They never had any intention

07:46.591 --> 07:49.594
of giving these women
actual life skills...

07:49.677 --> 07:53.055
[stammering] or just paying them,
paying them for their labor.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.600
Uh-huh. That's right, Mr. C.
You tell her.

07:56.768 --> 08:00.312
Look, Joe. You can jab your long finger
all over the place.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.857
At MCC, at me...

08:03.775 --> 08:05.485
but let's be honest,

08:05.568 --> 08:07.737
shouldn't you also be pointing it
at yourself?

08:11.365 --> 08:14.118
Oh, fucking spare me, Natalie.

08:14.201 --> 08:16.579
You know a thing or two
about how this prison

08:16.663 --> 08:20.667
became a fucking cesspit
of corruption, don't you?

08:20.750 --> 08:24.879
From the bad plumbing
to the faulty wiring,

08:24.962 --> 08:27.214
to the poor employee vetting standard,

08:27.298 --> 08:29.842
[stutters] the nonexistent
staff training program,

08:29.926 --> 08:31.844
and... and, and, and, and...

08:32.929 --> 08:34.681
[softly] The ass-tasting food.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.974
Doctors who can't tell a pussy
from a hole in the ground.

08:37.058 --> 08:40.061
Us having to dig holes in the ground.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.855
White COs walkin' 'round
like it's Animal Farm

08:42.938 --> 08:45.191
and they the pigs.
You tell her that.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.860
Inedible food. Subpar health care.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.571
-Mmm.
-Manual labor.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.280
-Racial profiling.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:51.363 --> 08:52.949
Indiscriminate punishment.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.951
[whispers] And guards that sit around
jerking off all day.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.285
Guards that sit around j...

08:59.080 --> 09:00.414
Not doing their jobs.

09:01.373 --> 09:05.002
And their security protocol... so lax

09:05.086 --> 09:10.132
that a CO managed to waltz in here
with a loaded firearm.

09:10.216 --> 09:15.137
And who's ultimately responsible
for all prison operations,

09:15.221 --> 09:17.890
including, but not limited to,

09:17.974 --> 09:22.144
inmate safety,
work and recreation programs,

09:22.228 --> 09:24.856
guard training, and so forth?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.401
The warden.

09:30.402 --> 09:32.864
And who's that, Joe?

09:34.156 --> 09:35.407
Who's the man?

09:35.491 --> 09:37.284
[Taystee] Come on, Mr. C.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.953
You got this.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.287
Ain't that right...

09:40.371 --> 09:43.082
Man, where the fuck did everyone go?

09:43.165 --> 09:49.296
It's the middle of the night.
Even rioters need to sleep sometimes.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.674
Pee. Now I'm free, free to pee.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.594
[shower running]

10:01.183 --> 10:03.477
-[toilet flushes]
-Ghosts are not real.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.066
Ghosts are not real!
And clowns can't help it!

10:09.150 --> 10:11.611
They're just doing their job!

10:11.694 --> 10:12.945
[inmate gasps]

10:17.449 --> 10:18.492
[sighs]

10:22.579 --> 10:23.998
My face is wrong.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.835
My face...

10:30.254 --> 10:31.714
is under...

10:33.841 --> 10:34.967
the wrong.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.812
Love the face God gave you, Suzanne.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.563
[exhales heavily] Black is beautiful.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.400
From your hair to your derriere,
your nose to your toes.

10:51.483 --> 10:54.195
You make all the colors...

10:54.278 --> 10:55.487
pop!

11:05.957 --> 11:08.876
Wash your face, or you'll get acne.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.964
Don't pick the acne, or you'll get scars!

11:15.800 --> 11:17.676
[humming]

11:28.813 --> 11:29.939
[water stops]

11:32.817 --> 11:34.651
Your skin is beautiful.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.697
Like...

11:40.407 --> 11:41.658
walnut wood...

11:43.452 --> 11:44.912
and soil.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.126
And...

11:52.044 --> 11:54.380
western coneflowers.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.969
And... old metal.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.763
[breathing heavily]

12:04.223 --> 12:07.101
[whispers]
And dark maple syrup in brown jars.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.985
But wear a hat,
or else your skin will get darker.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.863
And always, always moisturize!

12:19.781 --> 12:20.907
[Maureen] Suzanne?

12:21.824 --> 12:24.493
I need to moisturize.

12:24.576 --> 12:25.870
It's very important.

12:33.669 --> 12:36.130
Maureen, do you have moisturizer?

12:37.506 --> 12:38.715
Please.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.052
Oh, no good.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.806
No good.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.141
-[groans softly]
-But don't worry.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.143
Your face is under there.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.562
-[groans]
-Oh!

12:51.645 --> 12:53.272
And it's beautiful.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.775
I know you don't see it right now,
but you will one day.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.362
It feels hot.
[breathes heavily]

13:00.446 --> 13:04.241
I think it's time to ask for help,

13:04.325 --> 13:07.536
'cause sometimes you need help

13:07.619 --> 13:10.164
and it's okay to ask.

13:10.247 --> 13:13.750
All I need is a poultice of bergamot

13:13.835 --> 13:17.504
and camphor
and the muddled eyelash of a virgin--

13:17.588 --> 13:19.966
No. No. Medical.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.384
We are going to Medical.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.096
The grown-ups have to help us now.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.347
[groans]

13:27.223 --> 13:28.474
[inmate snoring]

13:32.478 --> 13:33.687
[Ouija sighs]

13:35.397 --> 13:36.565
[clears throat]

13:36.648 --> 13:37.649
[Gloria scoffs]

13:38.567 --> 13:40.069
You're the hardest-working pair of bitches

13:40.152 --> 13:42.154
ever step foot in this prison,
you know that?

13:42.779 --> 13:45.657
Thirty-two hour shift?
No breaks?

13:45.741 --> 13:46.825
I'm impressed.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.245
We took a break
for that Pennsatucky trial thing.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.372
And the coffee shop, but that was work.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.124
Entertaining is work.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.917
Latina Fey over here.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.085
[clicks tongue] Nah, man.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.213
She only do that one dumbass Alaska lady
with the fucked-up-ass kids.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.299
Yeah, I got more range than that.
I'm like Kate McKinnon.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.800
Kate Dominican-on.

14:03.885 --> 14:07.804
-[laughing]
-Yo, you better than that. What the fuck?

14:07.889 --> 14:08.973
[groans]

14:09.056 --> 14:11.225
Did that coffee shop even happen?

14:11.308 --> 14:12.643
Seemed forever ago.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.939
[sighs] You don't even remember
what's, uh, real or fake anymore.

14:17.689 --> 14:19.608
You both need a break.

14:19.691 --> 14:21.193
Nah, we stayin' right here.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.238
Not takin' our eyes off of them
till negotiation's all wrapped up.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.823
Mmm. Now Daya turned herself in...

14:26.908 --> 14:29.201
-[sniffs] should be any day now.
-[grunts]

14:30.161 --> 14:31.578
-[Pidge sighs]
-All right, listen, though.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.872
Come on, for real.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.083
If this is gonna go on for a few
more days, you girls got to get some rest.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.085
The human body...

14:38.169 --> 14:41.964
um, starts shutting down after 31 hours
without sleep, did you know that?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.341
No way. Like what?

14:46.093 --> 14:47.761
When was the last time you took a piss?

14:50.681 --> 14:52.474
-Oh.
-[exhales heavily]

14:52.558 --> 14:54.351
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's the kidneys shuttin' down. Shit.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.436
What?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.229
Uh, well, maybe a quick power nap?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.605
Go. I got it covered.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.815
Go get some sleep.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.609
Maybe somewhere else.
You know, in one of the rooms.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.404
Privacy.
Shut out the noise, the lights.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.032
Huh? They got double mattresses in there.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.658
-[sighs]
-Yeah?

15:09.741 --> 15:10.952
All right. Only for a little,
though, all right?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.161
You know,
so we can come back fresh.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.247
Of course. Sweet dreams, right?
[chuckles]

15:15.331 --> 15:16.790
[sighs] Yeah.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.168
[Gloria] Try to pee.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.838
[sighs]

15:23.965 --> 15:28.344
Enough cayenne here to survive
an apocalypse or two.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.846
Keeps cats away
if you sprinkle it on the ground.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.391
You know something we don't?
Are the Martians comin'?

15:34.475 --> 15:37.894
Ladies, please, back off my shit!

15:37.979 --> 15:39.771
Everything has a place.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.483
I mean, it's good to be
prepared for anything,

15:42.566 --> 15:45.736
but this is, like,
Hitler-level preparation.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.280
-No offense.
-None taken.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.573
The man was prepared.

15:49.656 --> 15:50.866
Who's Bone?

15:51.575 --> 15:53.410
Stop mucking around.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.536
Bone a big fella?

15:56.538 --> 15:58.707
Bone is short for Skin and Bones.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.129
He was a kid who volunteered here
back in the '70s.

16:03.795 --> 16:05.839
He ran the swim fitness program.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.052
But then they drained the pool,
and that was that.

16:10.136 --> 16:15.599
How come he sent you a postcard
from Guatemala in '82?

16:15.682 --> 16:17.934
Why did he sign it, "Love"?

16:18.019 --> 16:19.436
[grunts softly] Dang.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.149
Who wants to go spelunking?

16:23.232 --> 16:24.483
Is this dynamite?

16:25.067 --> 16:27.903
I wouldn't mind a roll in the hay
with this one.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.532
Okay! Enough!

16:32.866 --> 16:34.618
Everybody, sit down!

16:39.290 --> 16:42.459
No more touching
what ain't yours to touch.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.753
Bunch of careless stoners!

16:44.836 --> 16:47.881
You are guests in my home!

16:48.799 --> 16:51.760
Don't make me trigger the booby traps.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.181
You're pathetic. You know that?

16:55.264 --> 16:57.308
-[spits]
-[sighs]

16:57.391 --> 16:58.809
[Piper grunting]

17:04.940 --> 17:07.276
What happened to you
that you're like this, Piscatella?

17:07.358 --> 17:08.777
Huh?

17:08.859 --> 17:12.906
What? Were you, uh,
a pet-killing scourge of the cul-de-sac?

17:12.989 --> 17:16.242
Or was it more
of a Drama of the Gifted Child situation?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.288
-Huh?
-[Alex grunting]

17:19.371 --> 17:23.875
Did Papa Piscatella rage on you
for being "Little Desi the queer"?

17:23.959 --> 17:25.419
Watch closely, Nichols,

17:25.502 --> 17:27.171
'cause you're gonna be
contestant number two.

17:27.253 --> 17:28.964
Come on, man.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.509
I genuinely would love to understand

17:32.593 --> 17:35.554
how it is that a man
gets to be this fucked up!

17:35.637 --> 17:37.889
-[Nicky groans]
-[Piper grunting]

17:37.973 --> 17:39.683
[all grunting]

17:39.766 --> 17:41.017
[Nicky] Come on!

17:41.102 --> 17:43.979
What's the original narcissistic wound?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.732
Nicky, stop.
He doesn't speak human.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.152
[Piscatella] Now that is right, Stalina.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.363
Because I discovered a long time ago

17:52.446 --> 17:54.490
that actions speak
a whole lot louder than words.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.991
[breathing shakily]

17:56.075 --> 18:02.706
Inmates will always try to cheat,
manipulate or deceive you.

18:02.789 --> 18:04.875
-There must be consequences.
-[groans]

18:04.958 --> 18:06.042
-Stop it!
-[Blanca yelling indistinctly]

18:06.127 --> 18:08.504
-[Nicky] Fucking stop it!
-[Piper grunting]

18:08.587 --> 18:10.297
The fuck is wrong with you?

18:10.381 --> 18:11.715
[muffled grunting in the distance]

18:11.798 --> 18:12.883
Did you guys hear something?

18:14.801 --> 18:16.428
Riots are noisy.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.848
-Stop it.
-[muffled sobbing]

18:19.931 --> 18:21.892
No. Go right ahead.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.353
Do whatever you want, but let them go.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.605
You don't really want witnesses.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.108
Oh, but, see, that's the whole point.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.777
-I want everyone as a witness...
-[grunts]

18:31.860 --> 18:36.115
...when I tear off that mama bear costume
you strut around in so proud.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.659
-[hair tears]
-[grunts] What are you doing?

18:38.742 --> 18:41.162
I'm showing your family
who you really are.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.996
[crying]

18:44.873 --> 18:46.082
[gasping]

18:49.336 --> 18:50.421
[groans]

18:51.172 --> 18:52.589
Fucking...

18:52.673 --> 18:54.550
You're a vain...

18:56.718 --> 18:57.928
weak...

18:58.845 --> 19:00.096
pathetic...

19:02.308 --> 19:04.476
frail old jailbird.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.566
[Big Boo strains]

19:24.205 --> 19:25.706
[indistinct murmuring]

19:33.255 --> 19:37.218
You can dye your hair,
paint your face...

19:38.510 --> 19:41.347
but it doesn't change
the truth underneath.

19:49.896 --> 19:52.107
Here's your fearless leader, inmates.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.447
Look!

19:58.530 --> 20:00.449
[groaning] Ow!

20:00.532 --> 20:04.495
Look long and hard
at what prison does to a person!

20:04.578 --> 20:06.037
[crying]

20:06.121 --> 20:07.748
[Blanca muffled] I swear, I'll kill you!

20:07.831 --> 20:09.625
[inmates grunting and straining]

20:09.708 --> 20:11.460
[indistinct chatter]

20:17.799 --> 20:19.510
Oye, Rosado...

20:19.593 --> 20:21.177
[in Spanish] Look at this fuck.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.097
Light in his loafers, this one.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.641
[chuckles]

20:25.724 --> 20:27.309
[in English]
Get the fuck out of here, man.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.769
[in Spanish]
Goliath ain't light in nothin'.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.479
I'm telling you,
he a fuckin' fruit cocktail.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.314
[in English] Well, faggot or no...

20:33.064 --> 20:35.317
[in Spanish] It's time he learn
who really runs shit 'round here.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.777
[Piscatella] Excuse me.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.737
Listen up, inmates!

20:38.820 --> 20:41.907
Work detail's cut short today
because there's a health inspection,

20:41.990 --> 20:44.410
so you'll return to your cells
at the top of the hour.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.371
And, no, you will not be paid
for the lost time.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.123
-[inmates protest indistinctly]
-Quit the bitching, please.

20:50.206 --> 20:53.752
Try to remember, you are federal inmates,
not line cooks at Applebee's.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.506
Now there's a new shipment of produce
out on the loading dock

20:57.589 --> 20:58.715
that is not gonna move itself.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.676
Rosado, Hernandez,

21:00.759 --> 21:03.470
bring the boxes back in,
and you're done for the day.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.181
CO Samuelson will escort you
back to your block.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.559
You guys should go along, too.
There's a lot to carry.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.061
All hands on deck.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.814
As they say.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.901
Driscoll!

21:18.819 --> 21:20.070
What is this swill?

21:20.153 --> 21:21.613
Goulash.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.239
What the fuck did you just say to me?

21:23.324 --> 21:24.533
Sorry, sir.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.827
It's, uh, beef stew.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.621
Yeah. That's what I thought.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.501
All right. All right now.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.252
You can cut it out, Mean Daddy.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.214
Did I sell it?
I felt like I was really selling it.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.717
Yeah. I mean,
you're a regular Bruce Willis.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.429
[chuckles] Hey, what'd you get
on 18 across today?

21:45.512 --> 21:46.555
"Dancer's leader."

21:46.638 --> 21:49.683
I got "blank, blank, N, T, blank."

21:49.766 --> 21:51.602
I got "S, A, blank..."

21:51.685 --> 21:53.312
Santa!

21:53.395 --> 21:55.856
-"Dancer," like the reindeer!
-Nice.

21:55.939 --> 21:56.940
Nice.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.067
[sighs]

22:03.822 --> 22:05.449
Something wrong?
You seem down.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.034
It's stupid.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.538
Nothing that matters to you is stupid.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.627
All right, it's not a big deal.

22:18.629 --> 22:22.924
Rosado and his merry band of bitches
swiped my radio yesterday.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.259
I'll kill them.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.970
-[chuckling]
-No, seriously, should I kill them?

22:27.053 --> 22:29.390
-No. Come on.
-I'll kill them. I will kill them for you.

22:30.056 --> 22:31.307
I brought you something.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.809
-What?
-Yeah.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.561
What, Christmas is coming
early this year, huh?

22:34.645 --> 22:37.063
-It's just a little stocking stuffer.
-[chuckles]

22:37.147 --> 22:38.314
It's, uh...

22:38.899 --> 22:40.901
some chocolate for my chocolate.

22:42.861 --> 22:43.820
[scoffs]

22:45.447 --> 22:48.074
It's always candy with you, huh?

22:49.660 --> 22:52.704
"My caramel swirl."
"My mocha chip."

22:53.622 --> 22:55.373
No. No, I wasn't...

22:56.583 --> 22:59.085
[sighs] I...

22:59.836 --> 23:00.879
I love it.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.424
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

23:03.507 --> 23:07.093
And for the record,
I think your sweet tooth is cute.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.513
You my sugar daddy, huh?

23:09.596 --> 23:11.181
-Huh? [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

23:12.182 --> 23:13.308
When I was a kid,

23:13.391 --> 23:17.187
I used to steal Toblerone triangles
from my mom's PMS stash...

23:17.270 --> 23:19.064
-[chuckles]
-And, this one time, she caught me

23:19.147 --> 23:21.942
and she made me eat
a whole jumbo bar as punishment.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.276
[laughs] Did you puke?

23:23.359 --> 23:25.779
No, I ate the whole thing,
and I asked her for another.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.238
[chuckles]

23:27.322 --> 23:30.241
-Insatiable appetite, huh?
-Yeah.

23:30.325 --> 23:33.078
I think that's when she
gave up trying to fix me.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.664
Thank God she did, huh?

23:37.708 --> 23:40.293
Look, you're perfect
like God made you.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.879
-You hear me?
-Really?

24:01.523 --> 24:02.774
I hate this.

24:04.275 --> 24:06.361
Having to hide. Having to be apart.

24:06.444 --> 24:07.988
[breathing heavily]

24:08.947 --> 24:10.782
Uh, let me show you something.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.909
[sighs]

24:16.204 --> 24:20.751
-[Piscatella sighs] What?
-So that you're with me, always.

24:22.836 --> 24:23.837
Forever.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.757
Even if we're apart.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.217
And I told O'Brien
to use a brand-new needle

24:29.300 --> 24:31.637
and a fresh tin of boot wax, okay?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.179
-So... Yeah.
-Good. Yeah.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.849
I also told him it meant
"double penetration," so that...

24:35.932 --> 24:40.020
[chuckles] he wouldn't think of nothing
but the dirty picture in his mind, right?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.688
-[chuckles]
-Hmmm.

24:43.064 --> 24:45.025
Yeah, clean this... clean this up!

24:45.108 --> 24:48.529
Jesus, inmate! Try not to make
such a fucking mess next time!

24:49.445 --> 24:50.531
Yes, sir.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.448
Right there is good, Rosado.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.700
Right there!

25:01.750 --> 25:03.919
-[Leanne panting]
-Is there a doctor in the house?

25:04.002 --> 25:06.588
We got to reattach a severed appendix!

25:07.589 --> 25:09.299
Doctor! [whimpers]

25:10.300 --> 25:12.260
-Oh! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
-What's wrong?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.137
-It's an emergency.
-Wait.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.723
He is way too buff to be a doctor.

25:17.849 --> 25:21.394
He's like one of those TV types who knows,
like, all that medical mumbo jumbo,

25:21.477 --> 25:22.896
but can't find his ass with his two hands.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.815
Quick. Can you sew this back on?

25:30.153 --> 25:31.613
It's been detached too long.

-[Leanne whimpers]
-Also, it's covered in Cheetos dust.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.788
And I'm a prison nurse,
not a plastic surgeon.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.498
And I've barely slept in days.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.919
And I only took this job
to earn enough to buy my own paraglider

25:46.002 --> 25:47.879
and a one-way ticket to Denali.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.507
And now, I don't even know
if I'm gonna get out of here alive.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.719
So there's no hope?

25:54.720 --> 25:58.014
But what about a finger transplant,
Doctor Samosa?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.474
[Leanne softly] Ooh.

25:59.557 --> 26:01.476
Who would be my organ donor?

26:01.559 --> 26:04.020
-One of the skinheads maybe?
-Yeah.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.065

you know what she's in for first.

Oh! Or the forger lady!

Well, what about Gandhi over there?

-I'll have the healing touch.
-[scoffs] Too brown.

to cage their rage with arts and crafts?

28:33.336 --> 28:38.508
This is not about resource allocation,
it's about priorities.

When it comes to casualties,
it isn't a question of "if,"

32:21.022 --> 32:22.398
it's a question of "how many."

Attica had 43.

New Mexico,
33 plus another 100 injured.

32:27.653 --> 32:30.531
And then there was Huntsville, 1974.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.784
That was one of the longest
prison standoffs in history.

three hostages managed to get free.

and was let out.

through the glass doors.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.048

in an escape attempt

the "Trojan Taco."

33:05.984 --> 33:08.194
Well, of course,
it was a suicide mission.

33:08.278 --> 33:11.947
All of the inmates ended up dead,
either by killing themselves,

33:12.032 --> 33:15.785
in the ensuing gunfire, or later,
through the death penalty.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.745
I suppose
that's the big takeaway from this,

33:17.828 --> 33:22.333
that the inmates guarding the hostages
almost never survive.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.598
He's not breathing.

37:06.181 --> 37:07.225
[groans]

37:08.309 --> 37:09.977
[gasps] No.

37:11.771 --> 37:12.813
No more being dead!

37:15.358 --> 37:16.526
[softly] Oh, sh...

37:18.319 --> 37:21.155
[groaning] I need to find an undoer.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.199
Oh, God. I need to find an eraser.
Oh! Oh!

37:24.284 --> 37:25.868
[panting]

37:30.039 --> 37:32.833
-I saw this in a movie one time.
-[Maureen] Suzanne.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.711
[crying] Come on. Come on.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.590
I'm gonna take him to see the Wizard.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.301
Or a witch.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.927
Or a doctor.

37:43.010 --> 37:45.513
Or a witch doctor.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.599
-Oh, where are all the grown-ups?
-Suzanne, wait.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.185
[grunting]

37:52.353 --> 37:54.021
[straining]

37:54.104 --> 37:55.105
Wait.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.525
[inmate snoring]

38:35.062 --> 38:37.648
Hey, don't touch it! Anthrax!

38:38.691 --> 38:39.775
This is a women's prison.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.902
It's more likely to have
a kid's Christmas list on it

38:41.986 --> 38:43.738
than a biological weapon.

38:43.821 --> 38:44.822
Dummy.

38:46.281 --> 38:49.535
"Hot Cheetos. Beyoncé.
Yearly gyno visits."

38:49.619 --> 38:50.995
That's one advanced kid.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.287
[softly] Turn it over.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.834
"Don't try anything, or we all die."

38:57.793 --> 38:58.878
Let's fuckin' get her.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.338
Make it count this time.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.840
I swear to God, if one more
of these bitches tries to fuck me, I'm--

39:02.923 --> 39:05.593
-Nobody wants to fuck you, asshole.
-All right, back off, boys.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.428
Yeah, simmer down, Anthrax.

39:08.721 --> 39:12.392
I'm gonna help you, okay? Follow me.
Come on, hurry up.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.062
Yo, what the fuck is this?

39:17.146 --> 39:19.023
[scoffs] They needed a piss break.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.983
And I couldn't say no. One of them
already peed on themself.

39:21.066 --> 39:23.486
Fuck no!
Back in the bubble, bitches.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.363
-I gotta pee. I gotta pee.
-I don't care.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.951
[sighs] You too lax, Mama.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.370
Your kids must run all over you.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.579
[sighs]

39:34.497 --> 39:36.624
I thought you guys were gonna sleep, huh?

39:36.707 --> 39:40.586
Nah, man. The TV told us
that now is when we gotta step it up,

39:40.670 --> 39:44.590
so now we gonna watch 'em extra close
from here on out, till this thing is done.

39:44.674 --> 39:48.093
So they don't sneak out
in no lambskin enchilada or nothin'.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.679
You can stay with us if you want.

39:49.762 --> 39:51.305
But you really gotta toughen up.

39:53.599 --> 39:54.600
Yeah.

39:56.811 --> 40:00.940
Funny thing is, is I used to love
small spaces when I was a little girl.

40:01.023 --> 40:03.568
You know, I was the kind of kid that...

40:03.651 --> 40:06.153
I liked the box
that fell off of the truck,

40:06.236 --> 40:09.198
and not, like, the car parts inside
or the dolls and the toys.

40:09.281 --> 40:10.282
Like, I wanted the box.

40:10.365 --> 40:14.495
My eighth birthday, I think,
I spent in the trunk of my uncle's Subaru.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.123
I was playing cave girl,
and I was so happy in there.

40:18.207 --> 40:19.792
I mean, I could have stayed
in there forever

40:19.875 --> 40:22.503
if he hadn't tried to cross state lines
with a warrant out on him.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.879
[chuckles softly]

40:23.963 --> 40:25.172
Yeah, I used to, um...

40:26.298 --> 40:29.552
hide on the top shelf of the linen closet
when I was a kid.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.095
Used to make me feel safe. [chuckles]

40:31.178 --> 40:33.055
[chuckles] Do you ever wonder...

40:34.557 --> 40:38.644
how things that used to feel so good
now feel so bad?

40:40.145 --> 40:41.188
I do.

40:42.398 --> 40:45.526
I mean, it's like, this is prison, yes.

40:46.611 --> 40:50.239
Shitty diarrhea food,
nothin' to do but sit...

40:50.322 --> 40:52.074
sit around and fucking wait, but...

40:53.534 --> 40:55.911
like, I used to be able to get through it.

40:56.954 --> 41:00.415
But now I can't really even
get myself up and out of bed.

41:01.501 --> 41:05.254
It's, like, there's, like, less air
in here to breathe or something.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.132
And... and it used to, before,

41:08.215 --> 41:11.426
you could... you could find somebody
to talk to if you wanted, you know?

41:11.511 --> 41:13.471
Or... or cookie's up their sleeve, and...

41:14.514 --> 41:17.224
Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.

41:17.307 --> 41:20.144
I'mma fuckin' ruin your life
just because I can."

41:20.686 --> 41:23.689
It's like human niceness
has just gone renegade,

41:23.772 --> 41:26.192
and I don't think
it's coming back anytime soon.

41:28.443 --> 41:30.905
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, me too.

41:31.572 --> 41:37.036
'Cause the sad truth of it is, is that
everybody in here is gonna be way worse

41:37.119 --> 41:39.246
than how they were when they started.

41:40.372 --> 41:41.373
Yes.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.168
Yeah.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.505
You are absolutely right.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.466
[fly buzzes]

41:53.803 --> 41:54.804
Hey...

41:55.888 --> 41:58.473
maybe... maybe we can help each other
get out of here, you know?

41:58.558 --> 41:59.559
The fence?

42:00.142 --> 42:02.311
I wonder if the backhoe works.

42:02.394 --> 42:05.355
Hey, come on.
We have to try, right?

42:05.439 --> 42:06.774
We can do this, like a... like a team,

42:06.857 --> 42:09.527
and we could even have
a special handshake or something, right?

42:13.573 --> 42:14.574
Oh.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.578
[groaning]

42:19.912 --> 42:21.455
You were the backhoe, bitch.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.540
[gasps]

42:23.123 --> 42:25.000
Stealing my friend behind my back, ho?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.877
You know, Boo was my best friend, right?

42:26.961 --> 42:28.170
-[spits]
-Ah!

42:28.254 --> 42:31.048
You know, women gotta start
being nicer to one another.

42:32.049 --> 42:33.050
[scoffs]

42:34.426 --> 42:37.805
Ow. Ow. [crying]

42:37.888 --> 42:39.682
Ooh, what about her?

42:39.765 --> 42:41.892
Ugh! No, shallow nail beds.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.770
Hey, Red Light Special,
where you hiding?

42:44.854 --> 42:48.232
[Stratman] Ladies! Hey, I'm over here.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.694
Oh, thank you, ladies.
[grunts]

42:52.612 --> 42:54.238
-Hi.
-[gasping]

42:54.321 --> 42:56.240
Hey, yeah, great to see you.

42:56.323 --> 42:58.325
[chuckles] Uh, so listen,
we need your help,

42:58.408 --> 43:03.163
because Leanne's finger was very rudely
shot off by your colleague with the gun.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.540
[groans] That's the... Humps?

43:05.625 --> 43:08.293
-Donuts.
-Ah! Angie! God!

43:08.377 --> 43:09.837
Oh, shit.
Sorry. I forgot.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.214
Uh, this is Doctor McCurry.

43:12.297 --> 43:14.675
He's going to cut off your finger
and put it on Leanne.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.302
-What?
-I'm ready for the transplant, Doctor.

43:17.386 --> 43:18.638
No, I'm... I'm not okay with this.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.180
Neither am I.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.391
Why do you even want his finger anyway?

43:22.474 --> 43:24.935
So she can finger herself
with his finger forever.

43:25.519 --> 43:27.187
-[shushes] Shut up.
-Obviously.

43:27.271 --> 43:30.691
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Uh, you... [sniffs]

43:30.775 --> 43:34.654
you gotta know if it works, right?

43:35.570 --> 43:40.492
So why don't you take it for a test-drive
before you commit?

43:40.575 --> 43:42.494
-Huh?
-[laughing]

43:42.577 --> 43:44.914
[both laughing]

43:44.997 --> 43:47.667
Okay, Apu. Into the poo. [laughs]

43:49.168 --> 43:50.795
Don't go anywhere, okay?

43:54.882 --> 43:57.301
Um... here's A.

43:58.385 --> 44:00.012
[moans]

44:00.095 --> 44:02.431
I don't know.
It feels sort of numb.

44:03.933 --> 44:05.059
B?

44:06.185 --> 44:08.562
[sighs] Angie,
I'm not sure if it's working.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.147
What do you mean, you're not sure?

44:11.065 --> 44:12.149
Haven't you ever...

44:15.319 --> 44:18.488
Oh, my God! You've never--

44:18.572 --> 44:21.241
Maybe I have.
I don't know.

44:22.159 --> 44:24.203
One time I peed a little,
so I thought maybe--

44:24.286 --> 44:25.663
If you had, you'd know.

44:27.122 --> 44:29.416
-[moaning] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
-[Stratman grunts]

44:29.499 --> 44:32.419
Oh! Go back! Go back!
What was that? What was that?

44:32.502 --> 44:33.754
It was W.

44:33.838 --> 44:36.131
-Do it again.
-All right.

44:36.215 --> 44:37.341
Do it again. Yes.

44:37.424 --> 44:40.344
-Yeah. [grunting]
-W! W! W!

44:41.178 --> 44:43.638
[screaming]

44:43.723 --> 44:45.557
-[cheering]
-[continues screaming]

44:45.640 --> 44:48.185
-Help!
-Hey, you really get off on this,

44:48.268 --> 44:49.687
don't you, you sick fuck?

44:49.770 --> 44:51.814
[Big Boo mumbling]

44:51.897 --> 44:55.567
Red, you're beautiful.
Hair grows back.

44:55.650 --> 44:57.694
[in Spanish]
Someone tell his face.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.488
[Big Boo grunting]

45:01.656 --> 45:04.701
Ah! [panting]

45:04.785 --> 45:07.079
Thank you, asshole.

45:07.162 --> 45:09.874
I guess not all lesbians
are good with their tongue, huh?

45:12.167 --> 45:14.419
[Piscatella] You're a real martyr,
aren't you, Reznikov?

45:24.471 --> 45:25.806
[grunts]

45:25.890 --> 45:27.016
No.

45:27.099 --> 45:28.308
[crying]

45:28.392 --> 45:31.311
Oh, don't be dramatic.
I'm not gonna kill you.

45:32.146 --> 45:35.524
I simply want your family
to see you for who you really are.

45:35.607 --> 45:38.152
To see the full Galina.

45:38.235 --> 45:39.528
[Red whimpers]

45:40.362 --> 45:44.033
-[groaning]
-A woman's face can hide weakness.

45:45.033 --> 45:46.869
-[groans]
-But their bodies can't.

45:48.328 --> 45:49.329
Yeah.

45:50.247 --> 45:51.331
[Red] Girls, look away.

45:51.415 --> 45:52.624
[crying]

45:53.375 --> 45:56.253
Yeah, big fucking man,
beating up on an old lady.

45:56.336 --> 45:57.504
[grunting]

45:57.587 --> 45:59.048
[gasps]

45:59.131 --> 46:00.549
[Alex grunting]

46:01.591 --> 46:03.803
[grunts] You dirty cunt!

46:03.886 --> 46:05.304
No! Stop it!

46:05.387 --> 46:07.222
Oh, I've had enough
of this insubordination!

46:07.306 --> 46:10.309
You are federal inmates,
not the queen of the fucking Nile.

46:10.392 --> 46:12.061
[muffled scream]

46:12.144 --> 46:14.063
Now tell me what you are,
so I know you understand.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.023
-You tell me!
-[Piper crying]

46:16.106 --> 46:17.817
[crying] Please.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.194
Last chance.

46:22.779 --> 46:24.114
-[bone snapping]
-[Alex crying]

46:24.198 --> 46:25.449
[Piper exclaims]

46:25.532 --> 46:28.911
I hope that someone treats you
the way that you are treating us,

46:28.994 --> 46:32.331
when you get locked up for assault,
you piece of shit!

46:32.414 --> 46:34.583
Right. Nice fantasy, January Jones.

46:34.666 --> 46:35.960
In a day or two...

46:36.043 --> 46:37.377
-[Alex groaning]
-...or whenever this is over,

46:37.461 --> 46:41.090
it's gonna be my word against
a bunch of criminals rotting away in Max.

46:42.007 --> 46:44.051
Who do you think they're gonna believe?

46:44.134 --> 46:45.886
[indistinct chatter]

46:59.274 --> 47:01.068
[inmate grunting]

47:01.151 --> 47:03.028
[Rosado] I'll shove my dick back in that
boca sucia qué tienes

47:03.112 --> 47:05.322
if you make a fucking sound...
[mutters indistinctly in Spanish]

47:12.579 --> 47:14.206
-[Piscatella] Hey!
-Shut the fuck--

47:14.874 --> 47:16.250
We was just wrestling.

47:17.626 --> 47:18.752
You want a turn?

47:19.753 --> 47:21.838
I mean, we loosened him up real good.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.883
Everybody knows that puto
loves to fuck for cash

47:23.966 --> 47:25.634
or whatever you got laying around.

47:25.717 --> 47:27.219
[grunts]

47:27.302 --> 47:29.263
-I will destroy you.
-[groans]

47:31.181 --> 47:33.350
-[grunting]
-[groans]

47:35.185 --> 47:38.230
Either one of you comes towards me,
I will skin you alive.

47:46.780 --> 47:49.533
[panting] Ten-two in D block six,
barbershop.

47:49.616 --> 47:51.660
Ten-eighteen, ten-twenty,
and we need a medic.

47:51.743 --> 47:54.038
I repeat, we need a medic in D block six.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.664
[Samuelson on radio]
CO Samuelson, roger that.

47:55.747 --> 47:58.918
-[Berk on radio] CO Berk, roger 10-18.
-[groaning]

47:59.001 --> 48:00.460
-Is he breathing?
-Yes.

48:04.339 --> 48:05.465
What are you doing?

48:05.549 --> 48:08.385
Tossing the room.
Standard after a 10-2.

48:08.468 --> 48:10.262
You hiding H in here, pretty boy?

48:11.471 --> 48:14.391
You're gonna live to regret it
if you're lying to me right now.

48:14.474 --> 48:16.518
You hear that? You're gonna live!

48:19.563 --> 48:21.190
I think we can all agree

48:21.273 --> 48:24.609
that y'all are the ones
who made a mess of this place.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.904
But can we please get back
to talking about how to fix it?

48:27.988 --> 48:32.117
I don't wanna hear no more
about how he done shit premature

48:32.201 --> 48:34.244
or how she like to take
a bite out of crime.

48:34.328 --> 48:38.457
And no more bullshit about bending over
and taking it up the ass

48:38.540 --> 48:43.670
or any other sick business that MCC might
have made y'all do for some reason.

48:43.753 --> 48:45.214
You're absolutely right, Jefferson.

48:45.297 --> 48:48.550
-If I could just--
-You could just listen...

48:48.633 --> 48:51.220
is what you could just.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.849
[sighs] It's time to talk about Bayley.

48:55.932 --> 48:59.186
I think it's time we talk
about the guard that Diaz shot.

48:59.269 --> 49:01.688
She shot the guy with his own gun

49:01.771 --> 49:04.274
that he brought in here
and started waving around.

49:04.358 --> 49:08.820
I'm sorry, but guns don't shoot people.
People shoot people.

49:08.903 --> 49:11.656
And in this case, it's one of your people
who did the shooting.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.244
Are you negotiating
for the governor, or for the NRA?

49:15.327 --> 49:17.329
Because we settled all of that.

49:17.412 --> 49:18.998
And Diaz is gone.

49:19.081 --> 49:21.083
Well, how do I even know
if this guard is still alive?

49:21.166 --> 49:23.502
You got my word for it is how.

49:25.087 --> 49:29.383
And we know the inmate Bayley killed
is for sure dead.

49:31.093 --> 49:34.388
Well, I would like to see this Humphrey
before we press on any further.

49:34.471 --> 49:36.139
Not that I don't trust your word.

49:37.974 --> 49:38.975
Do you trust mine?

49:39.059 --> 49:40.727
[sighs]

49:41.311 --> 49:42.562
I've seen him, Natalie.

49:42.646 --> 49:43.938
And?

49:44.981 --> 49:48.068
Yeah, he was in some discomfort,
but he's stable.

49:48.610 --> 49:49.611
[mouths] Thank you.

49:52.281 --> 49:53.490
Okay, then.

49:54.366 --> 49:57.869
-[sighs]
-Now, should we look at demand number ten,

49:57.952 --> 50:00.247
the inmates' desire
for more nutritious food?

50:00.330 --> 50:04.043
-I am afraid the costs associated with--
-Hey, don't go sinking your big teeth

50:04.126 --> 50:05.960
back into the budget bullshit,
Ms. Figueroa.

50:06.045 --> 50:07.796
And stop yawning!
We got work to do.

50:07.879 --> 50:11.591
Now listen, I got reports
right here, okay?

50:11.675 --> 50:13.677
All science and shit.

50:13.760 --> 50:17.514
They say, "Giving inmates a balanced diet
with fresh fruit and vegetables

50:17.597 --> 50:22.727
reduces the cost of health care
by 30% on an annual basis."

50:22.811 --> 50:26.731
Those savings should be more than enough
to cover the cost of a GED program.

50:27.649 --> 50:29.068
Mmm-hmm.

50:31.111 --> 50:34.573
Goodbye, mop that looks like Mommy.
Goodbye, slop that fills my tummy.

50:34.656 --> 50:38.535
Goodbye, Poussey...
Taystee? [panting]

50:38.618 --> 50:40.036
Red balloon. Over the moon.

50:40.120 --> 50:43.832
Breath. Death.
Taystee!

50:43.915 --> 50:45.959
Grace?
[whimpering] Graystee?

50:46.042 --> 50:47.711
[Black Cindy and Janae shushing]

50:47.794 --> 50:50.004
Aw, no, no, no!
What the fuck is goin' on?

50:50.089 --> 50:53.300
-The issue is he is not breathing.
-What?

50:53.383 --> 50:56.678
And the body needs oxygen,
or else the cells curl up like old leaves.

50:56.761 --> 50:57.762
But don't jump in the leaves,

50:57.846 --> 51:00.890
because the pile might have
ticks and spiders in them.

51:00.974 --> 51:02.684
Okay. What happened to you, Suzanne?

51:02.767 --> 51:05.479
[crying] I need help!

51:05.562 --> 51:07.981
-[Black Cindy] Okay.
-Then we got to get his cells to iron out,

51:08.064 --> 51:11.568
because... But you cannot touch the iron,
because it's going to burn your fingers.

51:11.651 --> 51:13.862
You have to throw
your spit at it and listen!

51:13.945 --> 51:16.198
-[shushes]
-[breathing shakily]

51:16.281 --> 51:18.533
Just the sound of the sizzle.

51:21.245 --> 51:22.246
Huh?

51:23.163 --> 51:24.873
What are you seeing, eye-lookers?

51:24.956 --> 51:25.999
No...

51:26.082 --> 51:27.876
Look, Taystee needs to see this.

51:27.959 --> 51:29.253
-She needs to!
-[Black Cindy] No, no, no, no.

51:29.336 --> 51:33.298
-Taystee busy right now, all right?
-Yeah. I, uh... think he's okay.

51:33.382 --> 51:35.550
Look, he even smilin'.
Wait...

51:36.135 --> 51:38.637
I think I hear him breathin' again.
He just needed some air, right?

51:38.720 --> 51:40.054
-[Janae] Yeah.
-[crying] No, no, no, no.

51:40.139 --> 51:43.057
-[shushes] Nice job, Suzanne.
-Yeah.

51:43.142 --> 51:45.977
Okay. Just... Here, let me... let me...

51:46.060 --> 51:50.399
Okay. Let's just U-turn this
and go to Medical, okay?

51:50.482 --> 51:52.108
Do a three-point turn, maybe, all right?

51:52.192 --> 51:54.903
Hey, look.
Here we go!

51:54.986 --> 51:57.656
[both in sing-song] We're going on a trip
to Medical.

51:57.739 --> 52:02.076
We're going to Medical.
We're going to Medical.

52:02.161 --> 52:04.829
-[groaning]
-You fucking sicko psycho.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.415
She needs medical attention.

52:06.498 --> 52:08.458
Piper, shut up.

52:08.542 --> 52:11.545
[muffled] Don't provoke an angry bear.
Or any fuckin' bear.

52:11.628 --> 52:12.837
[in Spanish]
Either way you get mauled.

52:12.921 --> 52:15.006
Haven't you done enough?

52:15.840 --> 52:16.966
Just about.

52:18.302 --> 52:19.594
What else do you want?

52:20.304 --> 52:22.847
You've put an old lady in her place.

52:22.931 --> 52:26.476
My own daughters can't look at me
without pity in their eyes.

52:28.061 --> 52:29.145
You win.

52:30.146 --> 52:31.231
Are you happy now?

52:31.315 --> 52:33.983
Yes... I am.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.946
It's like they taught me
at Jesus camp for little homos.

52:38.863 --> 52:41.950
"The righteous will rejoice
when he sees vengeance.

52:42.033 --> 52:44.953
He will bathe his feet
in the blood of the wicked."

52:45.036 --> 52:47.747
Oh, I bet your feet are disgusting.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.040
[groans softly]

52:49.123 --> 52:53.837
You see, this is the thing
about female prisoners.

52:53.920 --> 52:57.466
Men understand violence.
They respect it. They're dogs.

52:57.549 --> 53:01.220
If you beat them, they obey you.
Not women.

53:01.803 --> 53:04.723
Women don't fear pain the way men do.

53:04.806 --> 53:06.808
They have to be broken in other ways.

53:06.891 --> 53:08.810
But make no mistake...

53:09.728 --> 53:11.355
they have to be broken.

53:12.022 --> 53:15.025
Many inmates have tried
to make a fool of me over the years.

53:17.861 --> 53:20.364
None have succeeded.
And none ever will.

53:22.031 --> 53:23.992
-Oh, shit!
-[Nicky gasps]

53:25.118 --> 53:26.453
[Piper grunting]

53:27.120 --> 53:28.580
[indistinct chatter]

53:30.206 --> 53:31.750
What, you gonna fuck me?

53:31.833 --> 53:33.877
Or you want me to fuck you?

53:33.960 --> 53:36.380
Yeah, we all know that's how you like it,
you dinge queen.

53:36.463 --> 53:40.259
You a fucking bucking bronco,
ain't you, you motherfucker?

53:40.925 --> 53:42.761
Kiss my fucking ass, bitch!

53:42.844 --> 53:44.220
Fuck you!

53:44.304 --> 53:46.097
This is what you do
to get off, Tweety Bird?

53:46.180 --> 53:48.600
[laughs] By watching me sweat?

53:48.683 --> 53:51.436
Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!

53:51.520 --> 53:53.605
[grunts] Oh, God!

53:53.688 --> 53:56.483
[screaming] No! No!

53:56.566 --> 53:57.734
I think that's probably enough.

53:57.817 --> 53:59.694
[screaming continues]

54:00.820 --> 54:03.823
[softly] Come on, Desi.
We take 'em out when they start screaming.

54:04.449 --> 54:06.785
I don't hear anything, do you?

54:07.702 --> 54:09.621
[screaming intensifies]

54:17.754 --> 54:18.880
He saw me.

54:21.049 --> 54:23.134
I know you're down here, inmate.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.223
Oh, please, make this hard for me.

54:29.308 --> 54:32.185
It'll give me the pleasure
of wrecking you later.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.439
[grunts]

54:40.402 --> 54:42.862
Oh, you're gonna have to do
better than a pushpin.

54:43.780 --> 54:45.532
[grunting]

54:46.450 --> 54:47.492
Teamwork!

54:47.576 --> 54:49.578
Ah, how do you like that, Fruit Brute?

54:50.537 --> 54:54.916
[groggily] I will skin you alive.

54:56.668 --> 54:57.669
Oleander?

54:57.752 --> 55:02.048
Nah. Some old devil's breath
Bone sent me back in the '80s.

55:03.216 --> 55:04.300
[grunts] Yeah.

55:06.761 --> 55:08.930
We shared a love of botany, me and Bone.

55:09.639 --> 55:10.974
And some other things.

55:12.016 --> 55:13.810
But that's none of anyone's business.
