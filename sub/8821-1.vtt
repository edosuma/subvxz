00:38.705 --> 00:42.664
<i>Do you remember the story</i>
<i>of a girl who lived a life of cinders,</i>

00:42.742 --> 00:46.974
<i>and how she found true love because</i>
<i>she kept a beautiful dream in her heart?</i>

00:48.615 --> 00:51.709
<i>Of course it helped that she had</i>
<i>mouse friends who could sew</i>

00:51.785 --> 00:54.982
<i>and a Fairy Godmother</i>
<i>who could do wonders with pumpkins.</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:58.456
<i>Well, that girl is me.</i>

01:19.712 --> 01:23.944
Would my perfectly perfect
wife put on her perfectly fitting shoes?

01:24.017 --> 01:25.678
You found my shoes.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.719
Better hurry.
Fairy Godmother's waiting.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.189
What were the mice
using them for this time?

01:32.258 --> 01:33.418
Boats.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.482
There.

02:13.099 --> 02:14.828
Pathetic.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.566
Give me your hand.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.130
Surprise!

03:44.390 --> 03:47.985
So that's how Cinderella did it. Magic.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.414
Perfect!

04:21.527 --> 04:23.927
Mother! Mother!

04:25.098 --> 04:26.087
Mother!

04:26.165 --> 04:29.225
- Anastasia, where have you been?
- Slacking off again.

04:29.302 --> 04:32.271
Mother, our troubles are over!

04:33.706 --> 04:35.435
A stick?

04:35.508 --> 04:37.305
Ooh! Let's beat her with it.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.368
No, no, no, no. Not a stick.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.709
A magic wand.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.079
Well, she finally cracked.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.141
I saw this nutty old woman and zap!

04:46.219 --> 04:50.781
She gave Cinderella the beautiful gown
and, oh, the Prince.

04:50.857 --> 04:54.691
- I blame the housework.
- Oh, I'll prove it to you.

04:54.761 --> 04:58.561
Oh, what were those words again?
Wappity-pappity-poo?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.429
Skip-skip-scadoo?
No, I know it. I know it. I think.

05:01.501 --> 05:05.096
Oh, no I've got it. I've got it.
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

05:05.171 --> 05:06.638
Oh! There it is!

05:06.706 --> 05:08.765
Child, put that down!

05:08.841 --> 05:13.107
In the wrong hands that wand
could be extremely dangerous.

05:13.179 --> 05:16.342
Now, now give it back
to me you silly little goose.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.613
No way, Grandma.
Bibbidi-bobbidi boo!

05:33.366 --> 05:35.926
Look what you've done.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.061
Now give me back my wand.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.970
No, I need it,
you silly old garden gnome!

05:41.040 --> 05:42.701
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

05:51.117 --> 05:52.516
Oh!

05:52.585 --> 05:54.052
Oh-oh.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.987
Hello? Hello, hello, Grandma?

05:57.056 --> 05:59.081
Oooh! Oh!

05:59.158 --> 06:02.525
I... I'm sorry.
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you.

06:02.595 --> 06:07.089
So this is how Cinderella did it.
What delicious irony.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.828
Do you realize what this means, girls?

06:09.902 --> 06:12.496
Yes! No more laundry!

06:14.140 --> 06:19.203
It means power, riches,

06:19.278 --> 06:21.212
revenge.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.047
Oh.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.313
I wanna be dirty, filthy, stinking rich!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.378
Oh, I want a Prince of my own!

06:29.455 --> 06:30.979
Oh please, please, please.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.888
- Give it to me!
- No, give it to me!

06:32.959 --> 06:34.688
Girls! Girls!

06:34.761 --> 06:37.662
First things first.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.096
Now, Cinderella,

06:40.166 --> 06:43.829
to undo your trickery
and take what's rightfully ours,

06:43.903 --> 06:47.566
I call upon
all the forces of the universe!

06:47.640 --> 06:50.507
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

07:08.694 --> 07:13.393
Reverse the moon and sun,
turn back tide and time,

07:13.466 --> 07:17.027
unravel Cinderella's happily ever after

07:17.103 --> 07:20.470
to the moment my troubles began!

07:54.340 --> 07:56.001
Stop!

08:01.047 --> 08:03.311
Wow.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.987
The Grand Duke!

08:11.524 --> 08:12.718
It worked.

08:12.792 --> 08:17.388
Magnificent!
And no one knows except us.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.658
Get ready. This is your second chance.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.359
Don't waste it.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.662
Where's Cinderella?

08:22.735 --> 08:25.465
She's exactly
where she was the first time.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.096
Cinderelly!

08:30.543 --> 08:32.203
The Grand Duke!

08:32.278 --> 08:33.575
Your Excellence.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.840
Your Grace.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.474
His Grace will now
read the royal procla...

08:37.549 --> 08:40.451
Pardon me, but we're all aware
of his grace's purpose.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.885
Perhaps we should just...
get on with it.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.955
Quite, Madame. Quite.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.596
Ooh.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.712
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.511
It fits!

09:13.586 --> 09:14.848
It fits?

09:15.354 --> 09:17.117
It fits!

09:19.091 --> 09:20.388
Mother, it fits.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.689
Gee. I wonder if it fits.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.196
It fits, it fits! Oh, Mother!

09:25.264 --> 09:27.255
I'm gonna get my Prince!

09:27.333 --> 09:28.994
Woo-hoo!

09:30.102 --> 09:32.468
Grace and poise, my dear!

09:35.741 --> 09:38.471
I hereby declare

09:38.544 --> 09:42.947
that we have found
the Prince's bride-to-be.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.614
We must return to the palace at once!

09:51.157 --> 09:52.522
No. It can't be.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.186
Would Your Grace excuse me?

09:55.261 --> 09:58.560
I must have a word with my... maid.

10:00.566 --> 10:01.555
Oof!

10:03.936 --> 10:06.905
You look confused, dear.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.635
How could the slipper
have fit Anastasia?

10:09.709 --> 10:12.439
I danced with the Prince.
That was my slipper.

10:12.511 --> 10:15.969
Here, I have the other one.
I'm the one he's looking for.

10:16.048 --> 10:19.848
You may have danced with him.
You may even have thought it was love.

10:19.919 --> 10:24.822
But the slipper fits Anastasia,
and that's who he's marrying.

10:24.890 --> 10:28.758
Whatever you think happened
last night was a dream.

10:34.233 --> 10:38.431
I don't care where you go
or what you do,

10:38.504 --> 10:41.029
but you stay away from the palace.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.167
Stay away from the Prince.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.675
Oh and... clean up that broken glass.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.003
Duh... what just a-happened?

11:20.112 --> 11:23.377
I... I don't understand.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.750
I've...

12:21.774 --> 12:24.538
No, no. No cry, Gus Gus.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.908
Princey knows he danced with Cinderelly.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.247
Yes, of course he does.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.808
Oh, if I just see him again...

12:33.886 --> 12:35.911
Yeah, yeah, see Princey!

12:35.988 --> 12:38.456
Yes... everything will be alright.

12:38.524 --> 12:42.358
- Everything will be alright.
- Duh... yeah, yeah!

13:45.124 --> 13:47.649
Cinderelly, big blue guards.

13:47.726 --> 13:52.425
Gus Gus handle 'em.
Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!

13:53.966 --> 13:57.367
Um... Let's try
the servant's entrance first.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.302
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

14:04.376 --> 14:06.105
- Onions for the King.
- Well done.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.202
Strawberries.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.543
Keep out of sight.

14:09.615 --> 14:12.846
The King is waiting. There you are.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.682
- The King will enjoy them.
- They're his favorite.

14:19.725 --> 14:20.885
Hmm?

14:42.248 --> 14:45.342
Now, all we have to do
is find him and everything will be...

14:45.417 --> 14:46.884
Stop! You there.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.120
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

14:50.189 --> 14:51.349
I...

14:51.423 --> 14:53.983
I'm in charge of all
the servants in this castle,

14:54.059 --> 14:55.993
and I've never seen you before.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.753
What is your purpose?

14:58.831 --> 15:02.733
My purpose. Well... um... I...

15:02.801 --> 15:03.859
I...

15:04.370 --> 15:07.203
I'm the royal mouse catcher.

15:07.273 --> 15:11.107
Royal mouse catcher? Preposterous.

15:11.176 --> 15:13.337
Snap 'em and trap 'em.
That's my motto.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.606
Oh, no!

15:15.381 --> 15:18.839
In the 30 years
that I have supervised...

15:18.918 --> 15:21.512
...this castle,

15:21.587 --> 15:25.353
I can assure you there has never
ever been a single, solitary...

15:25.424 --> 15:27.415
Mouse!

15:28.861 --> 15:30.294
- Where is it?
- Mice!

15:37.102 --> 15:38.933
Oh, please, let me help.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.208
This is my kitchen.
I'll take care of it!

15:43.943 --> 15:47.379
Take that! And that! Vile vermin!

15:47.446 --> 15:48.879
Please, I can handle this!

15:48.948 --> 15:50.438
Not now!

15:50.516 --> 15:51.949
I've got them on the run!

15:52.785 --> 15:54.616
Really, I can help.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.124
There he is! I got him! I got him!

16:07.099 --> 16:10.159
So then, I'll just go get those mice.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.842
Come on, guys.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.675
Nice work.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.147
If we split up,
we'll find the Prince faster.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.683
Split up! Righty-o!

16:25.751 --> 16:29.016
- But, Dad...
- Those aren't reasons!

16:29.088 --> 16:32.649
Breeding, refinement!

16:32.725 --> 16:35.057
These are the reasons to marry someone.

16:35.127 --> 16:38.187
Not their choice
in transparent footwear!

16:40.666 --> 16:43.032
Ooh! Nice parry.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.091
Thanks.

16:46.205 --> 16:49.470
It's not about the slipper.
It's the girl in the slipper.

16:50.809 --> 16:53.539
She was... Well, she was...

16:53.612 --> 16:55.944
She was what?

16:56.015 --> 16:59.280
Well, she was the one.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.943
I know it.

17:04.423 --> 17:07.153
You think there's only
one woman in the kingdom

17:07.226 --> 17:09.285
who wears a size four and a half?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.185
It's all I have to go on here.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.890
Oh, poppycock!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.866
You remember when you met Mom?

17:28.146 --> 17:30.980
You said the first time
you touched her hand...

17:31.050 --> 17:33.245
...you just knew... instantly.

17:34.887 --> 17:39.256
Mmm. The stars were brighter that night.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.452
Dad, you found true love.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.655
That's all I want.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.756
Oh! They found her!

17:58.777 --> 18:00.938
Zug-zug!

18:03.715 --> 18:07.515
Now, if you ladies
would please have a seat,

18:07.586 --> 18:10.054
the Prince will be right with you.

18:14.993 --> 18:16.722
My Prince!

18:19.164 --> 18:20.597
Your Highness!

18:20.666 --> 18:23.430
Oh, hello.

18:23.502 --> 18:28.064
Am I in the right room?
Of course I'm in the right room. Um...

18:28.140 --> 18:31.268
Well there... There seems to be...
a little mix-up here.

18:32.010 --> 18:36.208
I assure you, Your Highness,
the slipper fits my daughter's foot.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.272
See? See?

18:38.350 --> 18:40.045
Huh. How could he miss it?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.747
Oh, yeah, I see. Um...

18:42.821 --> 18:47.121
It's just that I was expecting...
Well, someone else.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.786
I really do feel awful about this.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.057
But the royal proclamation declared...

18:52.131 --> 18:56.727
Yes, but it would appear that,
uh, more than one girl

18:56.802 --> 18:59.600
actually fits the... the slipper.

18:59.671 --> 19:03.038
I'm very sorry
to have inconvenienced you. Um...

19:03.108 --> 19:07.408
Why don't I have the Grand Duke
escort you home safely.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.175
If you'll please excuse me.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.739
Phew!

19:12.751 --> 19:14.480
- But... but...
- Quiet!

19:15.988 --> 19:18.513
You will forget who you
danced with at the ball,

19:18.590 --> 19:21.081
and marry the girl
who fits the slipper...

19:21.160 --> 19:23.958
...tonight. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.315
Wait. Hold the trumpet!

19:48.387 --> 19:50.048
It's all coming back.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.554
It is you.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.655
Please. Please tell me your name.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.961
It's... Anastasia.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.864
Anastasia.

20:03.969 --> 20:07.530
Well, I... I know it's sudden,
but will you marry me?

20:07.606 --> 20:09.506
Yes! Yippee!

20:20.852 --> 20:22.251
Ah!

20:27.759 --> 20:28.748
Yes. Er...

20:28.827 --> 20:33.389
I... I mean, yes. Definitely yes.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.161
I will marry you.

20:36.235 --> 20:40.171
Excellent. The ceremony
will take place tonight.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.072
I trust that meets
with your approval, sire.

20:43.141 --> 20:45.075
The sooner the better.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.943
Splendid. Then tonight
we will have a new princess.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.039
Wonderful. I'll go tell my father.

20:51.116 --> 20:54.313
Not good! We have
to find Cinderelly, Gus Gus!

21:10.002 --> 21:13.199
I feel better already.

21:13.272 --> 21:18.904
Grace and poise, girls.
Just remember, grace and poise.

21:18.977 --> 21:22.037
Right. Grace and poise.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.344
Oh, look, a harp.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.395
Lucifer?

21:45.337 --> 21:46.804
Lucifer?

21:53.078 --> 21:56.411
Lucifer! Come here!

22:06.858 --> 22:09.759
Phew.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.697
Your Highness.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.064
Yes?

22:17.135 --> 22:19.433
Hello.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.870
Um... Hello.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.306
It's wonderful to see you again.

22:24.376 --> 22:28.176
Um... I'm sorry, have we met?

22:30.048 --> 22:33.313
I believe we danced
last night at the ball.

22:35.120 --> 22:39.784
Well, uh... maybe you've
mistaken me for some other prince.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.791
I don't think so.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.728
You are quite the dancer.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.231
Well, it wasn't just me.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.895
It was the lady I was...

22:51.970 --> 22:53.835
...dancing with.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.078
Oh, Your Highness.

23:04.149 --> 23:08.142
Uh... As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna marry her.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.381
Marry? Really?

23:10.455 --> 23:12.082
Yes! Tonight.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.419
Tonight?

23:13.492 --> 23:15.926
Once you dance
with someone like Anastasia,

23:15.994 --> 23:17.825
you don't want to waste any time.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.864
Did you say Anastasia?

23:19.931 --> 23:21.023
Yes.

23:21.633 --> 23:22.895
But...

23:28.140 --> 23:31.598
Well... I guess I better be going.

23:31.676 --> 23:33.109
I've got to tell my father.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.339
- But that's not right.
- I'm sorry?

23:35.414 --> 23:38.577
You there. Royal mouse catcher!
I need you this...

23:38.650 --> 23:43.087
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry,
Your Grace. I didn't realize...

23:43.155 --> 23:44.247
I was the one...

23:44.322 --> 23:47.416
I need her this instant!
Please excuse us, Your Highness?

23:47.492 --> 23:49.483
Please. I'm sorry, just one moment.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.325
No, no, no. Of course,
I can see you're busy.

23:52.397 --> 23:54.592
I'll... I'll let you go.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.092
But... it was me.

24:15.787 --> 24:19.655
Start here! I want this castle
completely rodent-free

24:19.724 --> 24:21.715
in time for the wedding.

24:44.549 --> 24:46.244
Cinderelly! Cinderelly!

24:46.318 --> 24:47.615
Gus?

24:47.686 --> 24:49.017
Cinderelly!

24:49.087 --> 24:50.645
Whoa!

24:50.722 --> 24:52.189
We found Princey!

24:52.257 --> 24:56.159
I did too. But he doesn't
even know who I am.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.120
No, no, no!

24:58.897 --> 25:00.660
It's a magic.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.666
What? What are you talking about?

25:07.772 --> 25:09.103
Stepmother?

25:10.942 --> 25:13.911
- Fairy Godmother?
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

25:13.979 --> 25:15.173
She stole it?

25:15.247 --> 25:17.147
I show Princey!

25:18.083 --> 25:19.744
Princey! Princey!

25:21.353 --> 25:23.287
My Cinderelly awaits.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.324
Princey, you will marry Anastasia.

25:26.391 --> 25:27.881
Anesthesia.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.484
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

25:31.096 --> 25:34.532
She made him forget who I am.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.967
Magic! That explains it.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.333
Boys, we have to get that wand!

25:44.809 --> 25:47.835
Madame, the King himself
has instructed me

25:47.913 --> 25:50.643
to be solely in charge of this affair.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.151
I assure you
I have it entirely under control.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.914
Oh, really?

26:00.725 --> 26:02.386
Look at that!

26:02.460 --> 26:04.360
It's perfect!

26:11.436 --> 26:13.427
They smell lovely.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.598
Dispose of those roses at once.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.505
Anastasia's health is quite...

26:17.576 --> 26:19.009
Ah-choo!

26:20.612 --> 26:21.943
...delicate.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.447
I'm quite sure
I mentioned that to you.

26:24.516 --> 26:28.179
- Madame, I do not...
- Quite sure.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.209
Yes.

26:30.288 --> 26:35.351
Well, perhaps the young ladies
would like to sample the hors d'oeuvres.

26:38.229 --> 26:40.220
Your Grace, a word.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.896
These preparations
are entirely unacceptable.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.967
What a pig!

26:52.110 --> 26:53.737
Who's the pig now?

26:58.483 --> 27:00.474
You call this a cake?

27:03.788 --> 27:06.484
This wedding must reflect
my daughter's elegance.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.257
Drizella will be singing
in the ceremony.

27:10.328 --> 27:12.319
Are you sure that's a good idea?

27:16.868 --> 27:19.837
Oh, wait till you meet her, Dad.
She has everything.

27:19.904 --> 27:23.203
- Breeding, refinement...
- Yes, yes.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.110
No!

27:32.017 --> 27:34.008
Are we in the right room?

27:34.085 --> 27:36.485
You! How could you let this happen?

27:36.554 --> 27:39.079
Don't mind this.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.648
I shall have it cleaned up in no time.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.591
See that you do!

27:43.662 --> 27:47.257
I want this wedding
to go off without a hitch.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.766
And if it doesn't...

27:50.869 --> 27:52.837
Oh, no! Please, sire...

27:52.904 --> 27:54.804
I can explain. I well, you see...

27:54.873 --> 27:59.401
Father, allow me to introduce
my bride-to-be, Anastasia.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.810
Anastasia, this is my dad.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.748
It is an honor, Your Majesty.

28:05.817 --> 28:08.513
Charmed, I'm sure.

28:16.227 --> 28:19.560
So who's up for a dance?

28:20.532 --> 28:24.559
Your little escapade back
there could have cost us everything!

28:24.636 --> 28:26.194
Don't ruin this!

28:26.271 --> 28:28.239
Go get him, twinkle toes.

28:37.248 --> 28:40.479
Oh, I don't dance much.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.988
You're too modest.
That's how we met, remember?

28:44.055 --> 28:46.250
Oh, right. Of course.

28:46.324 --> 28:49.054
I'll never forget
when I first touched...

28:50.095 --> 28:51.687
...your hand.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.670
Oh! I'm sorry.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.214
It won't happen again.

29:14.786 --> 29:17.220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.782
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:23.161 --> 29:26.562
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:26.631 --> 29:28.462
Oh!

29:35.940 --> 29:37.032
I'm sorry.

29:38.209 --> 29:41.906
Oh, dear.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.779
Um... Are you OK?

29:50.054 --> 29:53.922
Oh! Oh, sorry, these aren't my shoes.

29:53.992 --> 29:57.359
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course they're my shoes.

29:57.428 --> 30:00.886
Oh, I just don't know
what's wrong with me today.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.126
Oh, no, no, it was my fault.

30:03.201 --> 30:06.500
I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date
on the latest dance steps.

30:06.571 --> 30:10.667
Sire, if I may, um, your fitting.

30:10.742 --> 30:15.145
Oh. Oh, yes.
This was fun. Thank you.

30:15.213 --> 30:17.875
Well, if you'll please excuse me.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.882
Um, come along, sire.

30:21.953 --> 30:25.252
And after the fitting,
we must approve the butter sculpture.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.416
I think it's a stunning likeness.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.992
Well, no grace, no poise.

30:33.064 --> 30:35.794
Other than that, it was lovely.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.597
He was nice to me.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.605
That's because
he's under a spell.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.836
He'd have to be, to fall for you.

30:46.644 --> 30:47.941
It's more than that.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.377
Ladies!

30:51.749 --> 30:53.774
Your Majesty!

30:53.852 --> 30:58.812
I need to speak with my future
daughter-in-law immediately.

31:00.925 --> 31:02.620
Alone!

31:08.766 --> 31:11.360
Let's make a run for it while we can.

31:11.436 --> 31:15.839
No, sire, sire, I'll have a dozen
dance instructors sent in immediately.

31:15.907 --> 31:17.238
Something's wrong.

31:17.308 --> 31:19.606
An army of dance instructors.

31:19.677 --> 31:20.939
No, no.

31:21.012 --> 31:24.641
I thought... Why, I was sure
it was Anastasia last night.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.877
But...

31:26.951 --> 31:29.511
...well, just now when
I touched her hand...

31:30.889 --> 31:32.550
...I felt...

31:33.925 --> 31:35.392
...nothing.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.861
Oh, I can explain everything,
Your Majesty.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.364
I have this,
this inner ear thing and, and...

31:41.432 --> 31:45.129
You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.834
Yes, I know, Your Majesty.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.068
Reminds me of my queen.

31:51.142 --> 31:53.702
She trod on my feet too.

31:54.779 --> 31:58.738
But she took very good care of my heart.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.915
Come here, my dear.

32:03.021 --> 32:05.649
I want to show you something.

32:08.526 --> 32:11.393
A princess is bestowed with many riches.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.894
Land, jewels, horses.

32:17.335 --> 32:21.601
But today I wish to give you
something much more valuable.

32:25.243 --> 32:26.232
Oh.

32:26.311 --> 32:27.972
Isn't it lovely?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.676
A seashell?

32:30.748 --> 32:35.208
This shell was the queen's
most treasured possession.

32:35.286 --> 32:39.985
We found it while
walking by the water the day we met.

32:40.058 --> 32:42.822
You see, we reached
for it at the same moment,

32:42.894 --> 32:46.421
and when our hands touched...

32:46.497 --> 32:50.297
...that's when I knew
I had found true love.

32:51.569 --> 32:54.800
You knew that just by touching her hand?

32:54.872 --> 33:00.811
There's no more powerful
force in the world than true love.

33:06.417 --> 33:10.080
Well, that's all. Run along, now.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.646
- Run along.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.422
I do.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.984
Oh, I do.

33:19.230 --> 33:22.927
I do. I do.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.196
I really do.

33:28.139 --> 33:29.663
Oh!

33:32.844 --> 33:34.004
Oh, I do.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.547
You go get the Prince.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.783
Bigger!

34:19.857 --> 34:21.824
Ooh, let's try this!

34:23.127 --> 34:24.856
Oh, that's gorgeous.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.056
Lovely.

34:31.135 --> 34:34.161
Drizella, stop that this instant!

34:35.739 --> 34:38.436
This wand is not a toy.

34:38.509 --> 34:41.444
It's in the dresser.
Key's in her pocket.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.014
I've got to get in there.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.712
Cinderelly! They'll see you!

34:48.786 --> 34:50.514
- Yeah, too dangerous.
- But I...

34:50.588 --> 34:52.112
We'll take care of it!

34:52.190 --> 34:53.554
I do.

34:53.623 --> 34:55.989
I do.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.391
I do.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.896
I do. Oh, I do.

35:09.407 --> 35:13.571
Alright, but whatever you do,
stay clear of Lucifer.

35:13.644 --> 35:16.010
Zug-zug. No Lucifee.

35:16.981 --> 35:18.744
What happened?
What'd the King say?

35:20.151 --> 35:22.210
He's really very nice.

35:22.286 --> 35:25.050
He gave me his most prized possession.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.591
A seashell?

35:27.658 --> 35:29.387
It's a symbol of true love.

35:30.695 --> 35:33.061
Oh, please.

35:33.131 --> 35:38.159
- How special.
- He said that his heart...

35:38.236 --> 35:41.865
What's love compared
to the power we hold with the wand?

35:41.939 --> 35:44.066
You will learn that soon enough.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.773
I want the Prince to love me.

35:47.845 --> 35:49.813
I think he could.

35:49.881 --> 35:53.146
Oh, you're serious.

35:53.217 --> 35:55.742
Well, the King likes me too.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.620
He treated me like his own daughter.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

36:00.124 --> 36:02.957
Maybe I should
have put on the slipper.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.529
Maybe we don't
even need the wand.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.395
Oh!

36:15.439 --> 36:18.033
Oh! Somebody put out the cat!

36:20.678 --> 36:24.273
Lucifer!
Oh, hold still! Stop!

36:35.393 --> 36:37.224
Lucifer!

36:37.795 --> 36:40.696
Someone fetch the housekeeper.

36:44.068 --> 36:45.865
Housekeeping.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.039
Well, you certainly came quickly.

36:52.109 --> 36:54.907
We're very good.

36:59.650 --> 37:03.848
Clean this up. My daughter needs her
beauty sleep before tonight's wedding.

37:03.921 --> 37:06.515
Think that'll be enough time?

37:22.073 --> 37:25.065
Keep out of the maid's way, girls.

37:25.142 --> 37:28.077
There's a lot to do before the wedding.

37:28.946 --> 37:30.846
Hmm?

37:34.585 --> 37:37.679
Isn't that right, Cinderella?

37:38.823 --> 37:41.587
I didn't know you worked here.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.060
You're far more persistent
than I thought.

37:46.130 --> 37:48.030
I won't let you get away with this.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.091
- We already have.
- I don't think so.

37:51.168 --> 37:52.760
Jaq! Gus!

37:55.873 --> 37:57.807
The wand!

37:59.510 --> 38:01.102
Us coming, Cinderelly!

38:04.649 --> 38:06.844
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

38:07.485 --> 38:10.454
That servant girl is a thief! Get her!

38:12.556 --> 38:13.921
Zug-zug.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.588
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.971
Stop! Thief!

38:31.042 --> 38:33.670
- Seize her at once!
- Don't move! Hold it!

38:33.744 --> 38:35.234
Halt in the name of the King!

38:40.484 --> 38:42.247
Whoa!

38:44.088 --> 38:46.022
You incompetent fools!

38:49.760 --> 38:51.022
Whoa!

38:53.397 --> 38:56.127
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

39:03.541 --> 39:05.475
Gus Gus!

39:15.019 --> 39:16.850
Run, Gus Gus!

39:16.921 --> 39:18.445
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

39:29.467 --> 39:31.628
There she is! We've got her.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.135
You there, halt!

39:33.204 --> 39:35.138
Halt!

39:36.374 --> 39:38.365
Open up in the name of the King!

39:41.078 --> 39:43.137
Oh, hello.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.705
Oh! Hey! What's going on?

39:47.251 --> 39:48.309
Hmm.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.378
Uh... Alright, I'm coming.

39:51.455 --> 39:52.854
Cinderelly!

39:52.923 --> 39:54.515
Open up, I say!

39:54.592 --> 39:56.253
Gus Gus!

39:59.163 --> 40:00.494
Catch.

40:03.434 --> 40:05.368
Open up in the name of the King!

40:06.937 --> 40:09.064
Lift the spell. Let him remember.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.833
Bibbidi-bobbidi...!

40:12.943 --> 40:14.433
Ooh!

40:16.013 --> 40:17.674
No!

40:17.748 --> 40:19.841
- What's going on?
- My apologies.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.908
It's a problem with my maid.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.420
- It's under control.
- Are you OK?

40:24.488 --> 40:27.548
- This servant girl is a thief.
- I am not a thief.

40:27.625 --> 40:31.083
You're under a spell. That's why
you don't remember me. Please!

40:31.162 --> 40:32.254
Just listen!

40:38.002 --> 40:40.903
Let go!

40:40.971 --> 40:45.135
Poor child.
Obviously out of her mind.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.870
I hope she'll be alright.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.936
She seemed, you know,
nice when I met her.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.539
Well, maybe a little confused, but,

40:52.616 --> 40:54.743
still there's something about her...

40:54.819 --> 40:58.118
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

40:58.222 --> 41:02.659
I'll see to it, personally,
that she gets all the help she needs.

41:02.693 --> 41:06.789
Nice try, but we won!

41:06.864 --> 41:09.298
You won? What do you mean?

41:09.934 --> 41:13.370
Uh... Well...

41:13.437 --> 41:14.904
...nothing.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.570
I... um...

41:18.642 --> 41:20.803
You'll see she's taken care of?

41:20.878 --> 41:23.210
Personally, Your Highness.

41:26.383 --> 41:28.851
Put her on the next ship
leaving the kingdom.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.285
I want her banished forever.

41:31.355 --> 41:32.822
Mmm.

41:33.691 --> 41:35.283
And you...

41:35.359 --> 41:37.850
Keep your mouth shut or you're next.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.731
Quite fetching.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.892
Ouch!

41:43.968 --> 41:45.959
Careful with those pins down there.

41:46.036 --> 41:49.062
Dad, something strange is going on.

41:49.139 --> 41:52.802
I'll say.
My son is finally getting married.

41:52.877 --> 41:55.038
No. No, I mean something's wrong.

41:55.112 --> 41:59.446
Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted
the girl who fit the glass slipper.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.415
- Yes, but...
- Now you've got her.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.817
Hey.

42:02.887 --> 42:04.582
That's what I'm worried about.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.850
Psst! Hey, Princey! Prince!

42:06.924 --> 42:09.688
- Over here!
- Princey!

42:09.760 --> 42:11.557
Psst! Psst!

42:11.629 --> 42:14.655
- Me?
- Yes, you. Let's go.

42:17.835 --> 42:21.703
OK, first birds, now mice.

42:21.772 --> 42:23.330
Come on!

42:38.522 --> 42:39.750
Hello?

42:44.061 --> 42:47.656
Hello? Uh... little mice?

42:50.601 --> 42:53.832
Well, it's official. I've lost my mind.

42:53.904 --> 42:57.931
First I was hijacked by birds,
and now I'm talking to imaginary mice.

43:00.511 --> 43:03.344
Hey, Prince Prince! Down here!

43:03.414 --> 43:04.779
OK.

43:06.183 --> 43:08.276
Maybe not so imaginary.

43:08.352 --> 43:11.719
Stepmother got a magic wand,
put spell on you. Fooled everyone.

43:11.789 --> 43:13.654
...came to the palace to marry you!

43:13.724 --> 43:16.818
Wait, hold on. Hold on.
I think I understand.

43:18.329 --> 43:19.853
Actually, I got nothing.

43:21.565 --> 43:24.295
Duh... What should we gonna do?

43:24.902 --> 43:25.891
Ahh!

43:49.159 --> 43:51.457
No, I danced with Anastasia at the ball.

43:51.528 --> 43:55.965
No, no. Princey only think that
because of Cinderelly's stepmother.

43:56.033 --> 43:57.500
Yeah, mean old lady.

44:15.886 --> 44:17.183
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

44:17.254 --> 44:19.518
You're telling me
I'm under a magic spell?

44:19.590 --> 44:21.581
And here's the worst part.

44:31.435 --> 44:33.335
Gus Gus!

44:33.404 --> 44:34.462
Sorry.

44:57.394 --> 44:59.191
Magic?

44:59.263 --> 45:02.960
Magic made me think
Anastasia was the girl at the ball?

45:04.935 --> 45:06.869
That would explain everything.

45:06.937 --> 45:08.564
Yeah!

45:18.582 --> 45:20.982
What? The servant girl?

45:21.051 --> 45:24.748
This Cinderelly? This belongs to her?

45:24.822 --> 45:27.382
- Yeah! Yeah!
- I have to find her.

45:27.458 --> 45:30.393
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

45:31.929 --> 45:35.126
- One more time.
- Duh, yeah.

45:49.513 --> 45:51.674
Oh... thanks.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.944
And loved the song.

45:54.017 --> 45:56.508
- Go! Go! Go, Princey! Shoo! Shoo!
- Go! Go!

45:58.756 --> 46:00.246
I have to go.

46:00.324 --> 46:03.418
Go? But you're about to be married.

46:04.328 --> 46:06.956
But the talking mice
say she's the wrong girl.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.624
Son, wait!

46:10.534 --> 46:14.129
Son! Talking mice? Son?

46:14.204 --> 46:15.228
Whoo-hoo!

46:15.305 --> 46:17.705
- And two bluebirds.
- Talking bluebirds?

46:19.376 --> 46:22.277
No, the bluebirds
weren't talking. Look, Dad...

46:22.346 --> 46:23.870
This is ridiculous.

46:23.947 --> 46:26.472
You agreed to marry
the girl in the glass slipper.

46:26.550 --> 46:29.576
- I was completely with you on that one.
- And I will.

46:29.653 --> 46:31.951
- Huh?
- Just as soon as I find her.

46:32.022 --> 46:36.550
I forbid you to take
another step down these stairs!

46:38.728 --> 46:39.752
OK.

46:41.564 --> 46:44.294
Son! Come back!

46:44.367 --> 46:47.302
We'll find you a doctor.
We'll have you leeched.

46:50.906 --> 46:53.238
We've got to get...!

46:53.309 --> 46:57.075
Guards!

46:57.146 --> 46:58.670
Aye!

46:58.748 --> 47:01.615
The servant girl. Where is she?

47:01.684 --> 47:04.676
Guards! He's gone completely mad!

47:04.754 --> 47:06.551
- Your Majesty!
- Stop my son.

47:06.622 --> 47:08.647
Your blood pressure!

47:08.724 --> 47:10.783
Stop! Stop!

47:10.860 --> 47:12.225
Dad, trust me.

47:12.294 --> 47:15.422
Son! I do trust you.

47:15.498 --> 47:18.092
It's the talking mice I'm worried about.

47:19.835 --> 47:21.803
Hiyah!

47:21.871 --> 47:22.860
Son!

47:22.938 --> 47:25.338
Close the gates! Close the gates!

47:33.182 --> 47:35.707
It'll be fine. Don't look up.

47:36.619 --> 47:37.984
Hiyah! Hiyah!

47:41.290 --> 47:43.190
Good boy.

47:45.094 --> 47:47.528
- Yeah!
- Go get her, Princey!

47:50.066 --> 47:52.933
I'll send the troops after him
at once, Your Majesty.

47:53.002 --> 47:55.061
No, let him go.

47:55.137 --> 47:57.332
But... but, Your Majesty, the wedding.

47:57.406 --> 47:59.067
Let him go.

48:17.259 --> 48:19.090
Time to go.

48:28.938 --> 48:31.372
All hands on deck.

49:17.853 --> 49:20.549
Loose the mainsail!

49:40.476 --> 49:41.807
Hiyah!

50:09.738 --> 50:12.104
Come on, boy! Nothing to it.

50:15.578 --> 50:18.012
Hiyah!

50:51.280 --> 50:52.611
Remember me?

51:20.342 --> 51:23.505
Will you marry me, Cinderelly?

51:23.579 --> 51:27.709
Yes, but... actually,

51:27.783 --> 51:29.580
it's Cinderella.

51:29.652 --> 51:32.416
Cinderella!

51:32.588 --> 51:35.113
- It's not over yet!
- What?

51:35.190 --> 51:38.057
He thinks he can ruin my plans.

51:38.127 --> 51:39.560
I think not.

51:39.628 --> 51:40.617
Who?

51:40.696 --> 51:43.824
The Prince. He's gone after Cinderella.

51:43.899 --> 51:47.562
- But I thought he loved me.
- Mother!

52:00.983 --> 52:02.644
Guards! Guards!

52:07.323 --> 52:09.416
It's no use. The magic didn't work.

52:09.491 --> 52:13.120
- It wasn't as powerful as their...
- You want the Prince to love you?

52:13.195 --> 52:14.219
Open up!

52:14.296 --> 52:15.923
Well, yes. Yes, of course I do.

52:15.998 --> 52:17.898
More than anything.

52:17.966 --> 52:20.628
- Then do exactly as I say.
- Open up!

52:20.703 --> 52:22.830
Open up in the name of the King!

52:25.040 --> 52:26.598
Huh?

52:27.376 --> 52:28.968
Hmm.

52:29.044 --> 52:32.639
Using magic on my son. The nerve.

52:32.715 --> 52:36.276
Your Majesty, we've gone over
every inch of the castle.

52:36.352 --> 52:37.842
It appears they have fled.

52:38.754 --> 52:41.154
Then search my entire kingdom!

52:41.223 --> 52:45.284
I want them found and arrested,
immediately!

52:47.930 --> 52:49.921
Keep in mind that I'm an old man

52:49.998 --> 52:52.967
and my heart can only take so much.

52:53.035 --> 52:55.333
Please, please, please,

52:55.404 --> 52:59.170
tell me that this is the girl
you intend to marry.

53:00.943 --> 53:05.710
All the stars are shining brighter,
Dad, just like you said.

53:05.781 --> 53:07.510
Then what are we waiting for?!

53:07.583 --> 53:12.282
Fetch the florist!
Bake an even bigger cake.

53:12.354 --> 53:15.221
The wedding is on tonight!

53:17.693 --> 53:21.629
Duh, no. This a way?

53:21.697 --> 53:23.631
Uh, uh, uh.

53:23.699 --> 53:25.633
No, no, no, no... thatta way.

53:25.701 --> 53:26.861
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

53:27.636 --> 53:28.898
Yes.

53:30.272 --> 53:31.967
Thank you.

53:33.208 --> 53:35.506
How lovely you look, my dear.

53:35.577 --> 53:36.908
Stepmother?

53:39.381 --> 53:41.406
Duh.

53:50.759 --> 53:53.057
It appears you were right, Cinderella.

53:53.662 --> 53:56.028
The Prince does want to marry you.

53:56.098 --> 53:59.192
And marry you he shall.

53:59.268 --> 54:01.065
Anastasia.

54:02.171 --> 54:03.229
Anastasia!

54:16.452 --> 54:19.888
Or should I say... "Cinderella."

54:22.891 --> 54:24.552
What have you done?

54:24.626 --> 54:26.594
The Prince won't be fooled.

54:26.662 --> 54:28.527
The Prince will never know.

54:28.597 --> 54:30.861
He'll be perfectly happy.

54:32.134 --> 54:36.070
But will you, Anastasia?
Will you be happy?

54:36.138 --> 54:39.198
I... I want what you had.

54:39.274 --> 54:41.765
But do you even love him?

54:41.844 --> 54:45.143
- I...
- Love! Look where it's gotten you.

54:46.815 --> 54:48.578
Cinderelly!

55:00.162 --> 55:01.652
Cinderelly!

55:01.730 --> 55:03.891
What's happened, Cinderelly?

55:22.184 --> 55:27.144
Lucifer, make absolutely certain
they don't come back...

55:27.222 --> 55:29.281
...alive.

55:29.358 --> 55:31.258
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.392
Huh?

55:40.469 --> 55:43.131
Lucifer?

55:44.239 --> 55:46.434
Hiyah!

56:01.823 --> 56:03.313
We need to stop this thing.

56:03.392 --> 56:05.485
Right away, Cinderelly.

56:05.561 --> 56:07.392
OK, OK. Chop-chop.

56:12.935 --> 56:15.426
Gus, can you reach the pin?

56:15.504 --> 56:16.994
Zug-zug.

56:44.766 --> 56:46.427
Gus Gus!

56:49.972 --> 56:50.961
Jaq!

56:55.644 --> 56:58.010
Gus, hold on!

57:02.351 --> 57:04.251
Lucifer!

57:04.319 --> 57:06.048
Let him go!

57:08.690 --> 57:10.419
Gus!

57:16.932 --> 57:19.366
Huh?

57:20.335 --> 57:21.563
Bad kitty!

57:33.649 --> 57:34.980
Whoo-hoo!

57:39.921 --> 57:41.889
Jaq! Gus!

58:22.197 --> 58:23.528
Now what are we gonna do?

58:24.066 --> 58:26.398
Well, I'm not gonna miss my own wedding.

58:26.468 --> 58:28.026
Whoo-hoo!

58:45.620 --> 58:47.986
Oh, thank you, my dear.

58:48.056 --> 58:51.184
This is all his mother and I
have ever wanted.

58:51.259 --> 58:55.889
To know that our son
has found his true love.

58:55.964 --> 59:00.992
So, you know it's love
when you touch someone's hand, right?

59:01.069 --> 59:02.866
At least, that's what I've heard.

59:02.938 --> 59:06.635
Why, yes!
That's what I've always thought.

59:36.805 --> 59:38.500
Whoo-hoo!

01:00:02.364 --> 01:00:04.855
Dearly beloved...

01:00:04.933 --> 01:00:07.902
So far, so good, Your Majesty. Hmm?

01:00:07.969 --> 01:00:09.869
He's not married yet.

01:00:09.938 --> 01:00:12.907
...to join together this man

01:00:12.974 --> 01:00:14.965
and this woman...

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:17.534
My one and only Cinderella.

01:00:17.612 --> 01:00:19.739
...in matrimony.

01:00:22.617 --> 01:00:25.745
We're almost there.

01:00:28.723 --> 01:00:29.712
Whoa!

01:00:34.462 --> 01:00:35.554
Halt!

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:39.794
...Cinderella,
take this man as your lawfully

01:00:39.868 --> 01:00:41.495
wedded husband?

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:44.801
You don't understand,
I must get inside.

01:00:44.873 --> 01:00:47.842
- Please.
- Just say it. Say, "I do."

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:49.774
I...

01:00:51.379 --> 01:00:53.279
Duh.

01:00:58.587 --> 01:00:59.645
I...

01:01:02.057 --> 01:01:03.046
...don't.

01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:05.951
Anastasia.

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:07.754
Cinderella.

01:01:11.199 --> 01:01:13.861
Spoiled little ingrate.

01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:17.029
I've given you everything
you ever wanted, Anastasia!

01:01:17.105 --> 01:01:19.767
But I want someone to love me, for me.

01:01:19.841 --> 01:01:23.333
Guards! Guards! Seize that woman!

01:01:25.747 --> 01:01:27.044
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.330
- And now for you!
- Turn her into a toad, Mother.

01:01:49.404 --> 01:01:51.668
Stop! No more!

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.300
- Even better.
- Cinderella!

01:01:54.376 --> 01:01:55.900
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

01:01:56.645 --> 01:01:57.839
No!

01:02:01.449 --> 01:02:02.939
No!

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:22.899
This is the real Cinderella,
your true love.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:37.317
It's you.

01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:57.371
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

01:03:04.212 --> 01:03:07.045
I can't take much more of this.

01:03:09.818 --> 01:03:11.149
Anastasia.

01:03:18.393 --> 01:03:20.156
Thank you.

01:03:22.897 --> 01:03:25.229
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

01:03:26.368 --> 01:03:27.995
Boo.

01:03:30.338 --> 01:03:34.604
Oh, goodness! I certainly am stiff.

01:03:36.444 --> 01:03:38.002
Your Majesty...

01:03:38.747 --> 01:03:40.681
...I don't deserve this.

01:03:46.254 --> 01:03:49.917
Everyone deserves true love.

01:03:54.696 --> 01:03:56.391
Oh!

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.591
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.473
Thank you.

01:04:09.911 --> 01:04:13.506
Would you like me
to return you to your former lives?

01:04:14.649 --> 01:04:15.980
Former lives?

01:04:16.051 --> 01:04:18.815
Why, yes. You see, you two...

01:04:18.887 --> 01:04:21.219
Well, you were already...

01:04:22.257 --> 01:04:23.952
Oh, never mind.

01:04:24.025 --> 01:04:27.324
Well?
Does anyone want to marry my son?

01:04:30.799 --> 01:04:32.460
I do.

01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:37.038
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:05:11.539 --> 01:05:15.202
<i>And they lived</i>
<i>happily ever after...</i>

01:05:15.276 --> 01:05:17.267
<i>...again.</i>

01:05:18.305 --> 01:05:24.746
