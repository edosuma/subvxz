Mike Ross never went
to law school.

00:02.952 --> 00:04.853
I knew it,
and I hired him anyway.

00:04.887 --> 00:06.188
I still can't stay, Harvey.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.323
I know.

00:07.357 --> 00:09.458
I just want to stop lying
to the people I love.

00:09.493 --> 00:11.160
This makes it look like
Forstman's payment

00:11.194 --> 00:12.361
never went to
any offshore accounts.

00:12.395 --> 00:13.662
That's forgery.

00:13.696 --> 00:15.498
Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

00:15.532 --> 00:16.532

Bullshit, you had no choice.

You could've said no at
any goddamn point along the way.

One thing is for sure:
When all this is over,

00:22.438 --> 00:24.305
I'm gonna fire the shit
out of you.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.340
I went to Robert Zane,

00:25.341 --> 00:26.674

to give Louis a job.

00:26.708 --> 00:29.010

Louis won't be going to Zane,
and neither will you.

00:33.882 --> 00:36.083
I'm here to ask you
to take Louis anyway.

00:36.118 --> 00:37.385
And why would I do that?

00:37.419 --> 00:38.453
If you do, I'll owe you one.

Mike Ross doesn't forget
anything.

00:39.921 --> 00:41.789
See, the reason
he didn't recognize this

00:41.823 --> 00:43.724
is because he didn't go
to Harvard.

00:43.759 --> 00:47.428
You've been lying to me
since the day Mike Ross arrived.

to me again.

00:51.266 --> 00:52.699
You might as well
spit it out.

You asked me what I wanted
once before, and I told you,

you must be a paralegal,

of work you're gonna be doing.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.808

thinks of me as a lawyer.

Oh, and if you're thinking
of crying to Harvey.

09:13.317 --> 09:14.484
that would be
a major mistake,

09:14.518 --> 09:17.020
because this is
between you and me.

09:24.629 --> 09:26.596
What are you doing here?

09:26.631 --> 09:28.498
I'm here because
I know you're angry

09:28.532 --> 09:30.633
and you're feeling betrayed,
but I am not gonna let you

09:30.667 --> 09:32.502
throw our friendship away.

09:32.536 --> 09:33.603
I can't throw away something

09:33.637 --> 09:35.138
that never existed
in the first place.

09:35.172 --> 09:36.612
- Louis--
- Donna, we're not friends.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.108
We were never friends, because
it was all based on a lie.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.709
So you think my giving you this

09:40.744 --> 09:42.612
and every other nice thing
that I ever did for you

09:42.646 --> 09:44.580
was just to keep you from
finding out about Mike?

09:44.615 --> 09:46.582
No, I don't.

09:46.617 --> 09:47.916
But I do think
if you had the chance

09:47.951 --> 09:49.519
to take back
all those nice things you did

09:49.553 --> 09:51.954
in exchange for me never finding
out about your little secret,

09:51.988 --> 09:53.088
you'd do it in a heartbeat.

09:53.123 --> 09:54.556
You want a chance
to tell me the truth?

09:54.590 --> 09:57.092
Go ahead.
Tell me the truth right now.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.961
And that answers my question.

09:58.995 --> 10:00.029
You know what, Louis?

10:00.063 --> 10:01.296
It was a
bullshit question

10:01.330 --> 10:03.598
designed to do nothing
but make me feel like shit.

10:03.633 --> 10:05.200
Mission accomplished.

10:05.234 --> 10:06.869
And now I'm gonna tell you
what I told Mike.

10:06.903 --> 10:08.837
- You're dead to me.
- Okay.

10:08.872 --> 10:10.839
You want to hate me?
Hate me.

10:10.874 --> 10:12.708
You want to hate Mike?
Hate Mike.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.843
But everybody at this firm
can't be dead to you,

10:14.878 --> 10:17.212
because sooner or later,
you're going to need someone.

10:17.246 --> 10:18.313
Thank you, Donna,

10:18.347 --> 10:20.515
but that someone
isn't going to be you.

10:26.789 --> 10:28.056
Donna said
you wanted to see me.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.158
No,
I didn't want to see you,

10:30.193 --> 10:31.759
I needed to see you.

10:31.794 --> 10:33.194
I know you're under
a lot of stress,

10:33.196 --> 10:35.597
but that was a one-time thing.

10:35.631 --> 10:37.199
I don't need you to do that
to me.

10:37.233 --> 10:38.366
Louis has
already done it.

10:38.401 --> 10:39.534
What are you talking about?

10:39.569 --> 10:40.634
Look at this.

10:40.669 --> 10:43.370
He's buried me
in paralegal work.

10:43.405 --> 10:45.445
Okay, that's bullshit.
He can't treat you like that.

10:45.473 --> 10:47.508
Rachel, I don't care
how he treats me, all right?

10:47.542 --> 10:49.510
I can take it
until he gets over this.

10:49.544 --> 10:50.977
But look at these deadlines.

10:51.012 --> 10:52.680
There's no way I can get
all of this work done

10:52.714 --> 10:53.714
on time without your help.

10:53.748 --> 10:55.268
I will do whatever you need,
but, Mike,

10:55.283 --> 10:57.618
he is not going to get over it
until you make him get over it.

10:57.652 --> 10:59.953
- Rachel, please--
- Mike.

10:59.987 --> 11:03.624
The day after what happened
in here happened,

11:03.658 --> 11:04.758
I shut you out.

11:04.792 --> 11:07.127
But then, a week later,
you came to my door,

11:07.161 --> 11:09.830
and you said you weren't gonna
let me go without a fight.

11:09.864 --> 11:11.198
That is not the same.

11:11.232 --> 11:13.166
I wanted you
to fall in love with me.

11:13.201 --> 11:16.669
I was already in love with you,
and you knew it.

11:16.704 --> 11:18.304
Yeah, well,
Louis is a lot of things,

11:18.339 --> 11:21.441
but he's not in love with me.

11:21.475 --> 11:24.444
He used to be.

11:24.478 --> 11:26.379
You just have to
make him remember that.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.118
Okay, the first thing
we need to do

11:31.152 --> 11:32.619
is finish all of this work.

11:32.653 --> 11:33.819
Okay.

11:33.854 --> 11:36.422
Unless, of course,
that offer still stands.

11:36.457 --> 11:37.857
I don't recall making an offer.

11:37.891 --> 11:39.659
You did say
whatever I need.

11:39.693 --> 11:41.026
That's not what I meant.

11:41.061 --> 11:43.829
And then you said never
take no for an answer, so...

11:46.032 --> 11:49.201
Lock the doors.

11:49.236 --> 11:50.903
- Are you serious--
- Take yes for an answer.

11:50.937 --> 11:52.405
I'm locking the door.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.575
Louis, you sounded urgent
on the phone.

11:56.609 --> 11:57.609
What's going on?

11:57.610 --> 11:59.411
I'll tell you what's going on.

11:59.445 --> 12:00.946
I'm back at
Pearson Specter.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.148
What?

12:02.182 --> 12:03.182
I don't understand.

12:03.216 --> 12:05.684
Let me explain it to you.

12:05.718 --> 12:07.219
I just became name partner.

12:07.254 --> 12:11.023
Louis, this is amazing.

12:11.057 --> 12:12.825
I'm so happy for you.

12:12.859 --> 12:13.959
Okay, well, you can keep
being happy for me,

12:13.994 --> 12:15.227
but you better start
being happy for you,

12:15.262 --> 12:16.427
because I'm bringing you back.

12:16.461 --> 12:19.197
What?
I--oh.

12:19.231 --> 12:21.532
Katrina Amanda Bennett,

12:21.566 --> 12:24.769
will you be my associate?

12:24.804 --> 12:27.839
Louis Marlowe Litt,

12:27.873 --> 12:29.740
I will be your associate.

12:29.775 --> 12:31.142
- Again.
- [chuckles]

12:31.177 --> 12:32.844
You've just made me
the happiest attorney on earth.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.913
When do we consummate our new
preexisting relationship?

12:34.947 --> 12:37.115
As soon as my new position
is official.

12:37.149 --> 12:39.417
- Wait, why isn't it official?
- I can't tell you that.

12:39.451 --> 12:41.519
Louis, I think I've more than
proven you can trust me.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.553
Oh, are you kidding me?

12:42.554 --> 12:43.754
You're the only one
I can trust.

12:43.789 --> 12:44.822
It's not that.
It's just--

12:44.856 --> 12:46.376
Okay, Louis,
you don't need to tell me.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.795
But if you won't tell me,
and they won't tell the world,

12:50.829 --> 12:51.962
something's wrong.

12:51.996 --> 12:53.397
Katrina, I know what I'm doing.

12:53.432 --> 12:55.098
And Jessica knows
what she's doing,

12:55.133 --> 12:56.934
which is playing you for a fool.

13:04.789 --> 13:07.157
Harvey, I was just gonna
call you.

13:07.191 --> 13:08.325
I'll save you the trouble.

13:08.359 --> 13:10.193
We're bringing Louis Litt
back to the firm.

13:10.227 --> 13:11.328
That doesn't matter.

13:11.362 --> 13:12.642
Because that call was
to tell you

13:12.663 --> 13:14.597
I'm hiring him,
and you owe me.

13:14.631 --> 13:16.132
Bullshit.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.434
You calling me a liar?

13:17.468 --> 13:18.628
I'm not calling you anything,

13:18.635 --> 13:20.837
but you are calling
Sylvia out there a liar.

13:20.871 --> 13:23.073
Oh, no, no,
Sylvia wouldn't tell you shit.

13:23.107 --> 13:24.107
Wrong.

13:24.108 --> 13:25.342
One compliment
about her hair,

13:25.376 --> 13:28.911
and she told me you gave Louis
the bad news an hour ago.

13:28.946 --> 13:30.613
See you around, Robert.

13:30.647 --> 13:33.116
Harvey, one more thing.

13:33.150 --> 13:35.185
You do still owe me
that favor.

13:35.219 --> 13:36.418
What kind of math
are you doing?

13:36.453 --> 13:38.220
The kind of math
that says Jessica Pearson

13:38.254 --> 13:41.056
hiring Louis Litt back
adds up to shady.

13:41.091 --> 13:43.131
If that's all you've got,
you can collect your favor

13:43.159 --> 13:44.694
when the clock strikes
kiss my ass,

13:44.728 --> 13:46.996
because partners leave firms
and come back all the time.

13:47.030 --> 13:49.932
Maybe, but they don't come back
with their name on the wall.

13:49.967 --> 13:53.002
Ah, I'm guessing he wasn't
supposed to tell me that.

13:53.036 --> 13:57.239
But he did, and Louis Litt
is not name partner material,

13:57.273 --> 13:59.575
which means he must have
something on you.

13:59.610 --> 14:01.677
So unless you want me
going around town

14:01.712 --> 14:03.612
flapping my big mouth
that something isn't right

14:03.646 --> 14:07.649
in your kitchen, you're gonna
make good on that favor.

14:07.683 --> 14:09.518
Sylvia didn't slip up at all,
did she?

14:09.552 --> 14:10.552
No, she didn't.

14:10.586 --> 14:12.587
You have your girl Friday;
I have mine.

14:12.622 --> 14:14.489
But you can still tell her
how nice her hair looks

14:14.524 --> 14:15.624
on the way out.

14:15.658 --> 14:17.291
I'll be in touch.

14:21.296 --> 14:23.464
Oh, you're tapping out already?

14:23.499 --> 14:25.499
I thought you'd have
a lot more backbone than that.

14:25.501 --> 14:28.202
I'm not tapping out.

14:28.237 --> 14:29.470
I finished all of the work--

14:29.505 --> 14:31.138
Which I expected to be done
an hour ago.

14:31.172 --> 14:33.908
Come on, Louis, you didn't
expect it to be done at all.

14:33.942 --> 14:36.510
Just like
you didn't expect this.

14:36.545 --> 14:37.845
What the hell is that?

14:37.879 --> 14:39.513
It's a gift certificate.

14:39.548 --> 14:40.948
What, are you trying
to bribe me now?

14:40.982 --> 14:45.318
It's not a bribe,
it's a reminder.

14:45.353 --> 14:49.122
Look, the gift certificate is
from Peter's Steak House,

14:49.157 --> 14:51.158
the place that you and I saved
together.

14:51.192 --> 14:52.292
And after we saved it,

14:52.326 --> 14:54.294
you told me that
we had something in common.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.295
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.329
Yes, you do,

14:56.330 --> 14:57.564
because what we had
in common

14:57.598 --> 15:00.633
was a love of the law.

15:00.668 --> 15:01.988
You told me that
when you asked me

15:02.002 --> 15:06.039
to be your associate, Louis,
and I am still the same person.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.274
And if I found out a woman
I had something in common with

15:08.308 --> 15:10.276
was actually a man,
I wouldn't keep seeing her.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.812
Okay, what I did is not at all
the same thing.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.847
No, it's worse.

15:14.882 --> 15:16.282
You say you love the law
so much,

15:16.316 --> 15:19.151
but every single case
you've ever touched is tainted.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.320
So you get exposed,
Peter's gets bulldozed.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.489
It wouldn't even be there
to get bulldozed

15:23.523 --> 15:24.991
if you and I hadn't
worked together.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.858
All right, genius.
You want to work together?

15:26.893 --> 15:29.294
You love the law so much?

15:29.328 --> 15:31.797
You're gonna memorize
every case that I've ever done.

15:31.831 --> 15:32.831
Louis.

15:32.832 --> 15:33.865
No, get to work,

15:33.900 --> 15:35.701
and use that magnificent
memory of yours

15:35.735 --> 15:36.735
for something more than

15:36.736 --> 15:38.436
bullshitting
your way through life.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.113
We have a problem.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.982
Unless it's urgent,
I don't have the time.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.882
Louis is telling people.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.217
What people?

15:53.251 --> 15:54.518
For starters, Robert Zane.

15:54.552 --> 15:56.721
Why the hell is Louis even
talking to Robert Zane?

15:56.755 --> 15:59.023
I asked him to hire Louis
after we took back VersaLife.

15:59.057 --> 16:00.591
And you didn't think to tell me
that after last night?

16:00.626 --> 16:01.859
I was handling it.

16:01.893 --> 16:03.661
From what I can tell,
you handled it like shit.

16:03.695 --> 16:04.762
So this is my fault?

16:04.796 --> 16:06.076
Well, it sure as hell
isn't mine.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.297
You know what, Jessica,
I'm not the one

16:07.332 --> 16:08.532
who wanted to fire Louis,

16:08.566 --> 16:10.434
and I'm not the one who wanted
to deny him clients.

16:10.468 --> 16:12.770
I did that because of
his performance as an attorney.

16:12.804 --> 16:16.006
You antagonized him for years
for your own pleasure.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.340
Tell yourself
whatever you want.

16:17.374 --> 16:19.042
You handed out
your share of abuse.

16:19.076 --> 16:20.744
Tell yourself
whatever you want.

16:20.778 --> 16:23.079
You're the one who hired a fraud
and gave Louis leverage.

16:23.114 --> 16:24.714
And I told you
Louis would get worse,

16:24.749 --> 16:25.909
and you said
I had to take it.

16:25.916 --> 16:27.483
Well, I don't care whose fault
it is,

16:27.518 --> 16:29.552
he is getting worse,
and I'm not gonna take it.

16:29.586 --> 16:31.688
Oh, yes, you are.

16:31.722 --> 16:33.023
You're going to take it,

16:33.057 --> 16:34.891
and you're gonna do it
with a smile on your face

16:34.925 --> 16:37.393
until I say otherwise.

16:37.427 --> 16:39.462
And what the hell
are you gonna do?

16:39.496 --> 16:42.831
I'm going to clean up this mess
once and for all.

16:45.501 --> 16:46.702
What do you mean,
you don't have

16:46.736 --> 16:48.170
diamond-encrusted
business cards?

16:48.204 --> 16:49.805
Fine, what about
the embossed ivory?

16:49.839 --> 16:52.107
Okay, great, well, how much
would 10,000 of those run me?

16:52.142 --> 16:54.143
Money's no object.

16:54.177 --> 16:55.977
What, are you crazy?
I'm not paying that much.

16:55.979 --> 16:57.412
Unless it comes
with a reach-around.

16:57.446 --> 16:59.347
Which, by the way,
I'm still not paying that much.

16:59.382 --> 17:00.749
Elite Printing, my ass.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.752
I give you
one simple instruction--

17:05.788 --> 17:08.556
to keep your mouth shut--
and you couldn't even do that.

17:08.589 --> 17:11.959
Um, okay, did you make
an appointment with Norma?

17:11.993 --> 17:13.260
- What?
- To see me.

17:13.295 --> 17:16.262
Did you check
with my secretary, Norma?

17:16.298 --> 17:18.098
Cut the shit, Louis.
I'm not in the mood.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.367
Well, get in the mood,
because I hold all the cards.

17:20.402 --> 17:22.435
And those cards are getting you
your name on the wall,

17:22.470 --> 17:23.704
but you need
to keep this to yourself.

17:23.739 --> 17:24.771
Why?

17:24.807 --> 17:26.240
So you can figure out a way
to screw me?

17:26.273 --> 17:27.641
I gave you my word.

17:27.675 --> 17:31.544
Well, no disrespect, Jessica,
but your word means shit.

17:31.579 --> 17:33.479
So if you want me
to stop telling people,

17:33.514 --> 17:37.017
you better start
telling people yourself.

17:37.051 --> 17:38.618
I told you, in good time.

17:38.652 --> 17:42.055
And I just told you
I don't give a shit.

17:42.090 --> 17:44.791
So I suggest you call a meeting
with the senior partners.

17:44.826 --> 17:46.126
Those meetings are
on Thursdays.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.460
Well, consider today Thursday.

17:47.494 --> 17:50.563
I told you, I have yet
to figure out how to sell it.

17:50.598 --> 17:52.766
You want to sell it?
I'll tell you how to sell it.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.601
You and Harvey do it together,

17:54.635 --> 17:57.604
you do it like you mean it.
and you do it now.

17:57.638 --> 17:59.305
Got it? Good.

18:06.231 --> 18:07.812
(Jessica) I'm sure
you've all heard rumors

18:07.813 --> 18:09.481
about why we called
this meeting,

18:09.515 --> 18:12.484
but that's because it's hard
to keep good news quiet.

18:12.518 --> 18:14.386
We'll be making this official
later this week

18:14.420 --> 18:19.056
but we're here to announce
our newest name partner,

18:19.091 --> 18:22.393
Louis Litt.

18:26.331 --> 18:28.332
Thank you, Jessica.

18:28.366 --> 18:31.102
Harvey.

18:31.136 --> 18:34.505
Some of you may be wondering
how this happened.

18:34.539 --> 18:36.207
There's a simple explanation,

18:36.241 --> 18:39.610
and all it requires is for me
to admit something.

18:41.378 --> 18:43.013
I made a mistake.

18:43.047 --> 18:46.817
I never should have accepted
Louis's resignation,

18:46.851 --> 18:48.952
because not only is he
a billing machine

18:48.986 --> 18:50.486
and a damn good attorney,

18:50.521 --> 18:53.056
he has personally gotten me
out of more than one jam,

18:53.090 --> 18:55.591
and there's no one
I'd rather have my name next to

18:55.626 --> 18:58.829
than my friend Louis Litt.

18:58.863 --> 19:01.798
Thank you, Harvey.

19:01.833 --> 19:05.868
Even though it's "not official,"
I already feel like

19:05.902 --> 19:07.436
my name's been up there
as long as yours.

19:07.470 --> 19:08.470
[chuckles]

19:08.471 --> 19:11.273
And I definitely feel like

19:11.308 --> 19:16.278
it's gonna be up there
for a long, long time.

19:21.551 --> 19:22.885
(Harvey)
A lot of good that did.

19:22.919 --> 19:25.186
Leave it to Louis to take
his big moment like a dick.

19:25.221 --> 19:26.221
Harvey, calm down.

19:26.222 --> 19:27.222
Calm down?

19:27.256 --> 19:28.823
I just did exactly
what he wanted,

19:28.858 --> 19:30.818
and he acted like a dick,
and he's not gonna stop.

19:30.826 --> 19:33.494
He's not gonna stop because
you didn't do what he wanted.

19:33.528 --> 19:35.763
Jessica, I just got up there
and kissed his ass

19:35.797 --> 19:37.165
in front of
the entire partnership

19:37.199 --> 19:38.366
and pretended to like it.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.500
Exactly.

19:39.534 --> 19:40.534
Pretended.

19:40.535 --> 19:43.203
Oh, you want me
to actually like it?

19:43.238 --> 19:45.038
I want you to make him
feel accepted.

19:45.073 --> 19:46.240
Jessica.

19:46.274 --> 19:48.242
Harvey, what Louis wants
is to be accepted.

19:48.276 --> 19:49.436
And like it or not,
the person

19:49.444 --> 19:51.111
he wants that from
the most is you.

19:51.145 --> 19:53.046
So you're gonna go to him,
you're gonna make nice,

19:53.081 --> 19:55.783
and that's how we're gonna
put all of this to bed.

19:55.817 --> 19:57.618
You want to tell me
what the hell that was?

19:57.652 --> 19:59.787
If you'll excuse me,

19:59.821 --> 20:01.922
I'm gonna let Jessica handle
this conversation.

20:01.956 --> 20:03.524
I have to go kill myself.

20:07.295 --> 20:08.962
Jeff, I can't do this
right now.

20:08.997 --> 20:10.163
Should I make an appointment?

20:10.198 --> 20:12.332
Because the partners may have
bought that fairy tale

20:12.367 --> 20:15.068
about Louis's triumphant return,
but they don't know what I know.

20:15.103 --> 20:16.103
What exactly is that?

20:16.104 --> 20:18.138
That Louis committed a crime,

20:18.172 --> 20:20.407
and then he resigned
five seconds

20:20.441 --> 20:22.175
before you were
about to fire him.

20:22.210 --> 20:26.479
And now he's not only back,
he's name partner.

20:26.514 --> 20:29.582
I reconsidered,
which, as managing partner,

20:29.617 --> 20:30.750
I am entitled to do.

20:30.785 --> 20:33.920
And as someone with a brain,
I'm entitled

20:33.954 --> 20:38.190
to come to the conclusion
that Louis has something on you.

20:38.225 --> 20:41.861
Jeff, you said you didn't
want me to lie to you anymore,

20:41.896 --> 20:43.296
and I'm trying
like hell not to.

20:43.330 --> 20:44.964
And that's the same thing
as lying to me.

20:44.998 --> 20:45.998
No, it's not.

20:46.033 --> 20:48.034
Oh, you are one hell of
a lawyer.

20:48.068 --> 20:51.704
So are you,
which is why you're here.

20:51.739 --> 20:53.540
So I'll come clean.

20:53.574 --> 20:56.275
I can't tell you the truth
about this,

20:56.310 --> 20:59.745
and that's as honest as
I can be with you right now.

20:59.779 --> 21:02.414
Can you handle that?

21:02.449 --> 21:05.517
I can handle it for now.

21:05.552 --> 21:07.252
But I won't handle it
forever.

21:16.529 --> 21:17.863
Louis, what are you doing here?

21:17.897 --> 21:20.131
I noticed you haven't
congratulated me yet,

21:20.166 --> 21:22.033
so I wanted to give you
a chance to make up for it.

21:22.068 --> 21:24.102
Right, congratulations.
We're all so happy for you.

21:24.136 --> 21:25.136
Is that what you wanted?

21:25.170 --> 21:26.838
Seemed a little disingenuous.

21:26.872 --> 21:29.006
Then let me be clear.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.307
I don't mean a word of it.

21:30.342 --> 21:32.343
You really want to talk that way
to a new name partner?

21:32.377 --> 21:33.744
I'm talking to you that way

21:33.779 --> 21:36.013
because you threatened to throw
the man that I love in jail

21:36.047 --> 21:37.482
to become
that name partner.

21:37.516 --> 21:38.616
So, you know what, Louis,

21:38.650 --> 21:40.150
I'm sorry
that I didn't bake you a cake.

21:40.185 --> 21:41.185
That's too bad.

21:41.186 --> 21:42.419
You didn't do anything for me,

21:42.454 --> 21:45.189
but I got something for you.

21:45.223 --> 21:46.290
Doc review.

21:46.324 --> 21:48.225
Filings to be done
in triplicate.

21:48.259 --> 21:51.462
Paralegal work,
since you like doing it so much.

21:51.496 --> 21:54.931
You know I don't like doing it
at all.

21:54.966 --> 21:56.733
You helped your boyfriend
with his work.

21:56.767 --> 21:58.035
You didn't think
I'd figure that out?

21:58.069 --> 22:00.404
You know what?
I don't care.

22:00.438 --> 22:01.705
You have no authority over me.

22:01.739 --> 22:03.440
I'm Harvey's associate.

22:03.475 --> 22:05.275
Yeah, but I run the associates.

22:05.310 --> 22:07.711
Therefore, I run you.

22:07.745 --> 22:09.413
I know what you're doing.

22:09.447 --> 22:11.215
But do you know
what you're doing?

22:11.249 --> 22:12.569
Not only do you live
with a fraud,

22:12.583 --> 22:13.917
you're just like him--

22:13.951 --> 22:15.591
pretending to be a lawyer
when you're not.

22:15.620 --> 22:16.987
I'm not pretending
to be anything.

22:17.022 --> 22:17.988
I am in law school.

22:18.022 --> 22:19.422
Are you really gonna make it
through?

22:19.456 --> 22:20.923
You could barely handle
the LSATs.

22:20.957 --> 22:22.325
You couldn't get into Harvard.

22:22.359 --> 22:24.593
As a matter of fact,
your boyfriend may be a fraud,

22:24.628 --> 22:26.529
but he's a better lawyer
than you'll ever be.

22:26.563 --> 22:29.265
You have no idea what kind of
lawyer I'm gonna be.

22:29.299 --> 22:30.900
Don't I?

22:30.934 --> 22:33.602
You learned from
the best liars around, Rachel:

22:33.637 --> 22:37.273
Harvey, Mike,

22:37.307 --> 22:39.642
your father.

22:39.676 --> 22:44.414
Yeah, I know exactly the kind of
lawyer you're gonna be.

22:44.448 --> 22:47.917
But until that day,
this kind of work

22:47.951 --> 22:49.651
is all you're good for.

22:55.058 --> 22:56.724
[Robert laughing]

22:56.759 --> 22:58.399
So you like marinated meat?
[both laugh]

22:58.428 --> 22:59.494
Oh, yum.

22:59.529 --> 23:01.163
Okay, wait,
but which one do you make?

23:01.197 --> 23:02.630
Kansas City or Memphis style?

23:02.665 --> 23:04.499
Oh, hell, when it comes to ribs,

23:04.534 --> 23:06.501
I make 'em
every which way I can.

23:06.536 --> 23:10.338
I am now officially starving.

23:10.373 --> 23:12.207
- Harvey.
- Please have a seat.

23:12.241 --> 23:14.443
Don't let my law firm get in
the way of your coffee klatch.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.143
Oh, now, now,
don't blame Donna here.

23:16.178 --> 23:18.079
I told her you and I had
some unfinished business.

23:18.113 --> 23:19.480
Already?

23:19.514 --> 23:22.183
What, did you pick something
out of your generic favor file?

23:22.217 --> 23:24.885
I've never done anything generic
in my life.

23:24.919 --> 23:27.654
This favor is tailor-made
for you.

23:27.689 --> 23:29.923
It's very specific
and very personal.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.059
We're in a little dispute
with another firm.

23:32.094 --> 23:33.827
I need you to get them
to back off of it.

23:33.861 --> 23:35.129
Why can't you do it yourself?

23:35.163 --> 23:36.964
'Cause I don't know the lawyer
on the other side.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.032
You do.
Good luck.

23:41.303 --> 23:42.623
What the hell
is he talking about?

23:42.637 --> 23:43.904
- It's Scottie.
- Aw, shit.

23:43.938 --> 23:45.038
I know.

23:45.073 --> 23:46.673
Scottie doesn't do favors
like this,

23:46.708 --> 23:48.108
and I don't have any leverage
on her.

23:48.142 --> 23:50.010
Yeah, you do.

23:50.044 --> 23:51.812
You're just not gonna
like using it.

23:51.846 --> 23:54.180
[groans softly]

23:56.317 --> 23:57.584
Hey, there you are.
[Rachel sniffling]

23:57.619 --> 23:59.739
Look, I just finished memorizing
all of Louis's cases,

23:59.754 --> 24:02.455
and I had an idea
I wanted to run by--

24:02.490 --> 24:04.057
Rachel, what happened?

24:04.092 --> 24:07.494
Nothing happened.

24:07.528 --> 24:09.394
What did Louis do?

24:09.429 --> 24:10.997
It's nothing.

24:11.031 --> 24:12.665
He found out that I helped you,

24:12.699 --> 24:14.399
and now he's giving me
paralegal work,

24:14.434 --> 24:16.002
and I was a little upset,
but now I'm okay.

24:16.036 --> 24:17.302
You weren't just
a little upset.

24:17.337 --> 24:18.604
You were crying,

24:18.639 --> 24:20.405
and a little paralegal work
wouldn't do that.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.440
It is not important.

24:21.441 --> 24:22.407
And you know what?
I had it coming.

24:22.442 --> 24:23.509
You had it coming?

24:23.543 --> 24:24.744
What are you--
Rachel, what did he do?

24:24.778 --> 24:26.278
Mike, I was the one that
told you to make up with him.

24:26.312 --> 24:27.747
- Rachel.
- I helped you with the work.

24:27.781 --> 24:28.848
- What did he do?
- And you know what?

24:28.882 --> 24:29.849
I lied to him
as much as you did.

24:29.883 --> 24:32.083
What did he do?

24:32.118 --> 24:37.556
It's not what he did,
it's what he said.

24:37.590 --> 24:38.590
What did he say?

24:38.625 --> 24:40.325
Mike, I'm a big girl,

24:40.360 --> 24:41.793
and I can take care of Louis.

24:41.827 --> 24:42.927
This isn't about you,

24:42.962 --> 24:44.996
this is about me and him,

24:45.031 --> 24:46.765
and I'm gonna make him
remember that.

24:51.771 --> 24:52.771
You piece of shit.

24:52.772 --> 24:54.173
You said this was
between me and you.

24:54.207 --> 24:55.307
It is between me and you.

24:55.341 --> 24:56.861
No, it stopped being
between me and you

24:56.875 --> 24:58.008
the second you went to Rachel.

24:58.043 --> 24:59.043
You put her between us

24:59.077 --> 25:00.311
the second you went to her
to help you.

25:00.345 --> 25:01.445
God, are you insane?

25:01.480 --> 25:04.315
Rachel has never been
anything but kind to you.

25:04.349 --> 25:05.783
I can't even count
the amount of times

25:05.817 --> 25:06.917
that she defended you.

25:06.951 --> 25:08.719
And now, she tries to help me
just a little bit,

25:08.753 --> 25:10.421
and you rip her to pieces.

25:10.455 --> 25:12.923
No, that's not the help
I'm talking about, fraud.

25:12.957 --> 25:14.958
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

25:14.993 --> 25:17.695
You went to her to help you
lie to me about who you are,

25:17.729 --> 25:20.431
and like the good little lackey
that she is,

25:20.465 --> 25:22.600
she came to me
and lied to my face.

25:22.634 --> 25:24.601
She did it to protect me,
Louis.

25:24.635 --> 25:25.635
Well, good for you,

25:25.636 --> 25:26.736
but when I found out about it,

25:26.770 --> 25:28.538
I felt like shit
for the 180th time.

25:28.573 --> 25:30.207
So I just went to her
and did the same thing.

25:30.241 --> 25:31.675
[sighs]

25:34.312 --> 25:35.978
You know, Louis,
I've just been memorizing

25:36.013 --> 25:39.148
all of your old arguments.

25:39.183 --> 25:42.118
I was actually gonna try
and come in here

25:42.152 --> 25:44.588
and use one of them
to change your mind about me.

25:44.622 --> 25:46.456
- It won't work.
- Oh, I know.

25:46.490 --> 25:50.926
Because while I am the same
person that I was before,

25:50.960 --> 25:52.060
you're not.

25:52.095 --> 25:54.697
You're right.

25:54.731 --> 25:57.266
I'm not the same person.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.601
I used to be
a man of my word,

25:58.635 --> 26:00.635
but you people taught me
that doesn't mean a thing.

26:00.637 --> 26:02.371
So when I told you

26:02.405 --> 26:05.441
it was between me and you,
I lied.

26:05.475 --> 26:07.809
I found your weak spot,

26:07.844 --> 26:10.178
and you know what
I'm gonna do?

26:10.213 --> 26:12.414
I'm gonna keep hammering on her

26:12.449 --> 26:14.650
until you break.

26:29.226 --> 26:30.392
Jessica.

26:30.426 --> 26:33.328
Please, if it can wait,
I've had a long day,

26:33.362 --> 26:34.529
and I need to go home.

26:34.563 --> 26:35.563
Too bad.

26:35.564 --> 26:36.797
You're staying here

26:36.832 --> 26:41.336
and drafting Louis Litt's
new partnership agreement.

26:41.370 --> 26:43.071
So now you're piling on too now?

26:43.105 --> 26:44.772
I'm not piling on.

26:44.806 --> 26:47.642
I am giving you this
because it's non-billable work

26:47.676 --> 26:51.846
and the only reason
it exists is because of you.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.649
This again?

26:54.683 --> 26:55.683
Excuse me?

26:55.684 --> 26:57.352
You heard me.

26:57.386 --> 26:59.054
I've seen this movie before.

26:59.088 --> 27:01.155
And the reason
it keeps rerunning

27:01.189 --> 27:03.190
is because every time
I think I'm done with you,

27:03.224 --> 27:06.927
you and your dirty little secret
rear your ugly heads.

27:06.961 --> 27:07.961
You know what, Jessica?

27:07.962 --> 27:09.363
I have had it up to here

27:09.397 --> 27:11.731
with you saying that this is
my dirty little secret.

27:11.766 --> 27:14.101
You could have fired me when
you found out, and you didn't.

27:14.135 --> 27:15.902
No, you decided to keep me
around

27:15.937 --> 27:17.237
because you were more concerned

27:17.272 --> 27:19.673
with beating Daniel Hardman
and keeping your power.

27:19.707 --> 27:21.041
And then you kept me around

27:21.076 --> 27:22.642
because you didn't want to
lose Harvey.

27:22.677 --> 27:25.011
And then you wanted to use
my secret to beat Harvey,

27:25.046 --> 27:27.114
and then again
and again and again.

27:27.148 --> 27:29.083
So please, Jessica,
why don't you tell me,

27:29.117 --> 27:32.319
when the hell does this become
your dirty little secret?

27:48.069 --> 27:50.103
This seat taken?

27:52.539 --> 27:54.240
Hi.

27:54.274 --> 27:55.809
Hey.

27:55.843 --> 27:58.344
Since your message
was so cryptic,

27:58.378 --> 28:00.413
I'm assuming
this is about business.

28:00.447 --> 28:02.915
I need a favor.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.883
Hey, Scottie.

28:04.918 --> 28:06.018
How are you?

28:06.052 --> 28:07.853
How have you been
since you left?

28:07.887 --> 28:09.855
I heard that
you took some time off.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.090
Where did you land?

28:11.125 --> 28:13.659
I need you to settle your case
against Robert Zane.

28:13.693 --> 28:14.860
And why would I do that?

28:14.894 --> 28:16.162
Because I owe him one.

28:16.196 --> 28:19.932
Harvey, I'm just getting
back on my feet at a new firm.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.900
This case is winnable.

28:21.935 --> 28:25.138
The firm knows that it is
because I told them it is.

28:25.172 --> 28:26.506
I settle,
I look like shit.

28:26.540 --> 28:28.274
I know that,
but you came to me once

28:28.308 --> 28:30.143
to take it easy on you
with Folsom Foods--

28:30.177 --> 28:32.411
Because you said if I was ever
in trouble personally--

28:32.446 --> 28:34.779
I am in trouble personally.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.948
What the hell is personal
about Robert Zane?

28:36.982 --> 28:38.283
You don't do this for me,

28:38.317 --> 28:41.386
Zane's going to put it together
about Mike Ross.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.496
Scottie.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.398
You selfish son of a bitch.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.832
You said you told me that

28:54.867 --> 28:57.135
because you didn't want to keep
lying to the people you love.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.170
I didn't want to.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.737
And now you come to me
trading on the fact

28:59.772 --> 29:00.972
that I know to get you
out of a jam

29:01.006 --> 29:02.740
for doing something
stupid and selfish

29:02.775 --> 29:03.841
that drove a wedge between us

29:03.876 --> 29:05.156
before we ever even
had a chance.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.410
I told you the truth.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.645
After it was too late.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.680
Scottie.

29:08.681 --> 29:11.348
I loved you.

29:11.383 --> 29:16.054
I loved you,

29:16.088 --> 29:19.857
and you let some stupid secret
that I would never tell anyone

29:19.892 --> 29:24.662
come between us because
you couldn't trust me with it.

29:24.697 --> 29:25.697
You're right, Scottie.

29:25.698 --> 29:29.233
I don't have a leg to stand on.

29:29.267 --> 29:33.470
But if you don't do this for me,
I am in trouble.

29:40.644 --> 29:44.614
I'm going to recommend
we settle with Robert Zane.

29:44.648 --> 29:45.648
Thank you.

29:45.649 --> 29:46.817
But to be clear,

29:46.851 --> 29:48.952
you get to ask me this once.

29:48.986 --> 29:50.854
And I never want to hear
the name Mike Ross again.

29:50.888 --> 29:51.888
Scottie--

29:51.889 --> 29:53.190
Once.

30:07.638 --> 30:10.640
[footsteps approaching]

30:11.975 --> 30:13.943
You wanted it to be official.

30:13.977 --> 30:14.977
There it is, Louis.

30:14.978 --> 30:18.013
It's official.

30:18.048 --> 30:20.916
So that's it?

30:20.951 --> 30:23.085
People are just gonna walk in
here tomorrow morning

30:23.120 --> 30:25.588
like it's any other day
and see it or maybe not see it?

30:25.623 --> 30:26.623
What were you expecting?

30:26.624 --> 30:28.358
A ceremony and a brass band?

30:28.392 --> 30:29.626
We don't do that.

30:29.660 --> 30:32.295
Well, I'm name partner,
and I say we do now.

30:32.329 --> 30:33.763
Excuse me?

30:33.797 --> 30:35.631
You heard me.

30:35.665 --> 30:38.968
I want pomp and circumstance
in the form of an unveiling.

30:39.002 --> 30:40.836
I'm going home, Louis.

30:40.871 --> 30:42.304
I'm not spending
the rest of the night

30:42.338 --> 30:43.873
emailing invitations
to an unveiling.

30:43.907 --> 30:45.040
You're going home?

30:45.075 --> 30:46.842
Well, then I'll send them out
myself.

30:46.877 --> 30:48.644
Because tomorrow...
[elevator dings]

30:48.678 --> 30:49.779
This is happening.

30:49.813 --> 30:50.913
4:00 p.m. sharp.

30:50.947 --> 30:52.148
I have a meeting at 4:00.

30:52.182 --> 30:55.951
Then reschedule it.

30:55.986 --> 30:58.254
You don't want me
to reschedule.

30:58.288 --> 31:01.522
What you want is
to know you've earned that.

31:01.556 --> 31:04.625
I have earned it,

31:04.660 --> 31:06.327
but I want you to know it.

31:06.361 --> 31:07.595
Okay, here it is.

31:07.629 --> 31:09.597
You got your name up there
by finding leverage

31:09.631 --> 31:11.666
and using it to strong-arm me
into doing something

31:11.700 --> 31:13.034
that I never would have done.

31:13.068 --> 31:14.068
See, I knew you--

31:14.069 --> 31:15.270
Let me finish.

31:15.304 --> 31:18.372
It was a stone-cold move,

31:18.407 --> 31:21.409
and it's exactly what Harvey
would have done.

31:21.443 --> 31:23.678
Now, if that doesn't tell you
that you've earned it,

31:23.712 --> 31:25.379
then I don't know what will.

31:27.982 --> 31:29.216
[elevator dings]

31:29.250 --> 31:31.118
You still want me to reschedule
my meeting?

31:31.152 --> 31:32.152
Yes, I do.

31:32.153 --> 31:34.755
Fine. I'll be there.

31:34.790 --> 31:36.824
You and Harvey.

31:36.858 --> 31:39.059
Of course, Louis.

31:39.093 --> 31:42.062
We're your partners.

31:45.934 --> 31:46.900
Jesus, you look like shit.

31:46.935 --> 31:48.135
What's going on?

31:48.169 --> 31:50.671
Between drafting Louis's
partnership agreement

31:50.706 --> 31:54.140
for Jessica and Louis's
never-ending onslaught,

31:54.174 --> 31:55.775
I didn't get any sleep.

31:55.810 --> 31:57.250
Well, splash some water
on your face,

31:57.277 --> 31:58.878
'cause we have to go to
his debutante ball

31:58.912 --> 31:59.946
and look like we give a shit.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.113
No. I'm not going.

32:01.148 --> 32:02.468
What do you mean
you're not going?

32:02.483 --> 32:04.050
Now is not the time
to poke the bear.

32:04.084 --> 32:05.084
It's too late.

32:05.118 --> 32:06.353
The bear is an asshole,

32:06.387 --> 32:08.120
and he's not just taking it out
on me anymore.

32:08.155 --> 32:09.589
- He's taking it out on Rachel.
- What?

32:09.623 --> 32:11.491
Yeah, he made it clear
that he found the weak spot

32:11.525 --> 32:13.259
that's going to get to me,
and he's gonna keep

32:13.293 --> 32:15.595
pressing it and pressing it
until I can't take it anymore.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.364
Mike, you are not ringing
that bell.

32:17.398 --> 32:19.198
You're damn right
I'm not ringing that bell.

32:19.233 --> 32:21.735
But if I have to go raise
a glass to that son of a bitch,

32:21.769 --> 32:24.269
I'm gonna end up
smashing it over his head.

32:26.272 --> 32:28.340
Come with me.

32:28.375 --> 32:29.375
What are you going to do?

32:29.376 --> 32:32.344
Enough is enough.

32:32.379 --> 32:33.379
[door clicks]
Harvey.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.847
You're just in time.

32:34.881 --> 32:36.415
Jessica's on her way down
with the partnership agreement.

32:36.449 --> 32:37.649
You here to be my witness?

32:37.684 --> 32:40.118
He's here to keep me
from ripping your face off.

32:40.152 --> 32:41.712
Oh, I see.
Now that big brother's here--

32:41.721 --> 32:43.021
(Harvey)
Okay, that's enough.

32:43.055 --> 32:44.556
Louis, you got everything
you wanted,

32:44.591 --> 32:46.091
and you are done
taking it out on him,

32:46.125 --> 32:48.826
because no matter what you do,
I'm not letting him quit.

32:48.861 --> 32:50.395
- Then I'll just fire him.
- You can't.

32:50.429 --> 32:52.197
I can, and I will,

32:52.231 --> 32:53.999
because Jessica would rather
he be fired

32:54.033 --> 32:55.267
than you all go to jail.

32:55.301 --> 32:56.634
No one's going to jail.

32:56.668 --> 32:58.469
See?
She knows what's what.

32:58.504 --> 33:00.738
I sign the agreement,
he's done,

33:00.773 --> 33:02.573
and then I bring Katrina back
as my associate.

33:02.574 --> 33:04.142
And that's not going
to happen.

33:04.176 --> 33:05.410
What are you talking about?

33:05.444 --> 33:06.604
Louis, I'm afraid you've made

33:06.612 --> 33:08.446
your last dictate to me
as name partner.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.515
I'm not gonna let you
take this away from me.

33:10.549 --> 33:12.150
I'm not taking anything away
from you.

33:12.184 --> 33:13.851
You are still name partner.

33:13.886 --> 33:16.153
Right after you sign this.

33:16.187 --> 33:19.290
I added a little something extra
after you finished drafting it.

33:19.324 --> 33:21.792
This says I'm co-conspirator
to hiring a fraud.

33:21.826 --> 33:22.826
You are.

33:22.827 --> 33:24.094
You became one

33:24.129 --> 33:26.563
the second you used him
to get your name on the door.

33:26.597 --> 33:27.631
I know I'm not a real lawyer,

33:27.665 --> 33:29.533
but that sounds like
he is to me.

33:29.567 --> 33:31.035
I am a real lawyer.

33:31.069 --> 33:33.437
He is.

33:33.471 --> 33:34.471
I'm not signing it.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.639
Louis, here's the thing.

33:35.673 --> 33:37.841
I told you not to tell anybody
about this,

33:37.875 --> 33:40.210
and then you went and
you shouted it to Robert Zane,

33:40.245 --> 33:41.845
and then you made me
tell the partners.

33:41.879 --> 33:44.180
And the capper is,
there are about a hundred people

33:44.214 --> 33:45.482
waiting to greet you

33:45.516 --> 33:47.651
after the unveiling
you arranged,

33:47.685 --> 33:50.720
which won't happen
if you don't sign that.

33:54.291 --> 33:56.025
I could still go to the police.

33:56.060 --> 33:58.995
Yeah, you could,
but you won't.

33:59.029 --> 34:00.464
'Cause you used
that little secret

34:00.498 --> 34:02.632
to get where you are right now.

34:02.667 --> 34:06.269
It was the only bullet
in your chamber,

34:06.303 --> 34:08.237
and I am taking your gun away.

34:08.272 --> 34:09.272
You set me up.

34:09.273 --> 34:10.373
You set yourself up,

34:10.407 --> 34:12.342
just like you did
with Charles Forstman.

34:12.376 --> 34:13.876
And what I learned from him was,

34:13.909 --> 34:15.444
once you get something
that you want,

34:15.478 --> 34:18.246
you will do whatever it takes
to keep it.

34:18.281 --> 34:22.083
So why don't you go ahead
and sign

34:22.118 --> 34:25.588
so we can get out
to your goddamn party.

34:42.596 --> 34:44.097
You know, it's funny.

34:44.130 --> 34:47.433
We've never had a ceremony
when we've changed names before,

34:47.467 --> 34:51.436
but Louis Litt had the audacity
to convene us all here today.

34:51.471 --> 34:54.806
And as it turns out,
his first decision

34:54.840 --> 34:57.242
as name partner is brilliant,

34:57.276 --> 34:59.777
because a ceremony like this
gives us a chance

34:59.812 --> 35:03.815
to reevaluate where we've been
and where we're going.

35:03.849 --> 35:05.817
Perhaps you had a disagreement
with a colleague,

35:05.851 --> 35:09.654
or there's some other issue
that's been on your mind.

35:09.688 --> 35:13.325
The point is, with a new name
comes a new beginning.

35:13.359 --> 35:16.960
For me, I'm hoping
we can see this as a chance

35:16.995 --> 35:18.762
to wipe the slate clean.

35:18.796 --> 35:21.765
With that said,

35:21.799 --> 35:25.269
here's to our newest
name partner, Louis Litt.

35:25.303 --> 35:26.870
[applause]

35:26.905 --> 35:31.175
[indistinct chatter]

35:31.209 --> 35:32.776
Nice speech.

35:32.810 --> 35:34.478
Let's hope it takes.

35:34.513 --> 35:35.833
It's got a better chance
of taking

35:35.847 --> 35:37.681
now that you made him sign
the agreement.

35:37.715 --> 35:39.682
That it does.

35:39.716 --> 35:40.883
Speaking of which,

35:40.918 --> 35:42.852
when exactly did you know
you were gonna do that?

35:42.886 --> 35:46.956
Oh, um, about 15 seconds
after Donna told me he knew.

35:46.990 --> 35:49.092
And you didn't feel the need
to bring me in on that plan?

35:49.126 --> 35:50.293
I felt the exact opposite.

35:50.327 --> 35:51.407
What are you talking about?

35:51.429 --> 35:53.596
Harvey, Louis wanted
to see you suffer.

35:53.630 --> 35:55.498
If I had told you,
you would have had to fake it,

35:55.533 --> 35:56.933
and you're a shitty actor.

35:56.967 --> 35:59.101
Excuse me, but I can act.

35:59.135 --> 36:02.137
No, everybody thinks
they can act, Harvey.

36:02.172 --> 36:04.740
The fact of the matter is, well,
you're just a pretty face.

36:04.775 --> 36:06.542
Oh, you think I'm pretty?

36:06.577 --> 36:08.343
Pretty stupid.

36:19.022 --> 36:21.490
I can't believe
it's actually up there.

36:21.524 --> 36:25.561
This firm is changing names
more than Prince.

36:25.595 --> 36:28.397
Who?

36:28.431 --> 36:30.832
You're kidding, right?

36:30.866 --> 36:32.201
<i>Purple Rain.</i>

36:32.235 --> 36:33.302
<i>Raspberry Beret.</i>

36:33.336 --> 36:34.836
I'm kidding.

36:34.870 --> 36:36.004
[chuckles]

36:36.038 --> 36:38.607
I almost had to reevaluate
our entire relationship.

36:38.641 --> 36:42.176
Mm-hmm, after you were gonna go
and beat Louis up for me?

36:42.211 --> 36:44.545
I doubt that.

36:44.580 --> 36:49.083
Mike, thank you.

36:49.118 --> 36:50.418
It just seemed right.

36:50.452 --> 36:52.120
After all, you stood up
to Louis for me.

36:52.154 --> 36:57.225
Mm-hmm, and I almost
got pummeled for it.

36:57.259 --> 36:59.160
That took guts.

36:59.194 --> 37:03.263
And that's why I love you.

37:03.297 --> 37:05.599
I love you too.

37:07.368 --> 37:10.004
I wanted to tell you
that you were right.

37:10.038 --> 37:12.606
I started this whole thing
by hiring Mike.

37:12.641 --> 37:13.874
It's my fault.

37:13.908 --> 37:16.443
Thank you.

37:16.477 --> 37:18.679
But I've been on board
long enough,

37:18.713 --> 37:20.914
and it's time
I accepted the fact

37:20.949 --> 37:23.350
that it's my secret too.

37:23.384 --> 37:25.218
So where do we go from here?

37:25.253 --> 37:27.419
We fight like
hell to protect it.

37:35.295 --> 37:39.165
No cake?

37:39.199 --> 37:42.301
What are you doing here,
Jessica?

37:42.335 --> 37:45.104
I know you're tired of waiting
for an explanation,

37:45.139 --> 37:47.006
so I'm here to give you one.

37:47.041 --> 37:50.442
You've given me explanations
before.

37:50.477 --> 37:53.312
I want the truth.

37:53.346 --> 37:55.581
Are you ready for the truth?

37:55.615 --> 37:58.050
Because it's not pretty.

37:58.084 --> 38:00.186
There's only one way
to find out.

38:03.290 --> 38:05.624
It seems like forever ago,

38:05.659 --> 38:08.694
but it wasn't that long ago
at all.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.468
Daniel Hardman embezzled money
from the firm,

38:17.503 --> 38:20.004
and I covered it up.

38:20.038 --> 38:22.139
Now, make no mistake,

38:22.174 --> 38:24.375
I found about it,
I confronted him,

38:24.410 --> 38:27.545
and I eventually made him
pay it all back.

38:27.580 --> 38:30.315
But I did cover it up.

38:30.349 --> 38:35.320
From the partners,
from the police, from everyone.

38:35.354 --> 38:39.890
I even adjusted our books
to hide the crime.

38:39.925 --> 38:41.792
And being a bloodhound
about these things,

38:41.827 --> 38:44.595
Louis found out

38:44.629 --> 38:49.867
and used it
as leverage to come back.

38:49.901 --> 38:51.635
As name partner.

38:51.669 --> 38:53.270
As name partner.

38:53.304 --> 38:58.209
Why couldn't you trust me
with that before?

38:58.243 --> 39:02.947
Because I didn't know
how you'd react,

39:02.981 --> 39:08.185
and I didn't want to risk losing
everything I had.

39:19.330 --> 39:22.466
Jessica,

39:22.500 --> 39:24.401
your secret is safe with me.

39:34.445 --> 39:35.411
You're late.

39:35.445 --> 39:36.712
But I come bearing gifts.

39:36.747 --> 39:39.014
Huh.
That doesn't look like cannoli.

39:39.048 --> 39:40.449
It's better than cannoli, Dad.

39:40.484 --> 39:42.251
It's the résumé
of your new associate.

39:42.286 --> 39:43.852
If this is Harvey's way of
trying to make up

39:43.887 --> 39:45.407
for the fact
that I didn't hire Louis--

39:45.422 --> 39:48.157
This isn't from Harvey.
It's from me.

39:48.191 --> 39:49.725
And you're going to do this
for me,

39:49.760 --> 39:51.994
and I am not going to owe you
a thing.

39:52.028 --> 39:53.829
This is what they're
teaching you at Columbia?

39:53.863 --> 39:54.897
[chuckles]

39:54.931 --> 39:56.331
Because that's not how
favors work.

39:56.365 --> 39:57.599
I know how favors work.

39:57.633 --> 39:59.801
You do this, and then you want
something from me someday.

39:59.835 --> 40:02.504
But by then
you're going to understand

40:02.538 --> 40:05.774
that right now
I'm the one doing you a favor,

40:05.808 --> 40:10.445
because Katrina Bennett
is an amazing lawyer.

40:10.479 --> 40:11.846
I was wrong about you.

40:11.880 --> 40:15.350
You're not like your mother.

40:15.384 --> 40:18.720
You're like your father.

40:18.754 --> 40:20.789
[as Robert]
Come on.

40:20.823 --> 40:22.324
- Oh, that's good.
- That was a good one.

40:22.358 --> 40:23.491
That was a good one.

40:23.526 --> 40:25.459
Sounds just like me,
baby girl.

40:25.493 --> 40:27.594
I had you fooled, huh?
[chuckles]

40:27.629 --> 40:29.062
You did.
[both laugh]

40:29.096 --> 40:31.231
Now let me show you
how a lawyer cooks.

40:38.239 --> 40:39.773
(Louis)
What do you want?

40:39.808 --> 40:41.675
I just thought
you'd want this.

40:41.710 --> 40:43.243
The associates saved it
for you.

40:43.277 --> 40:44.478
No, they didn't.

40:44.512 --> 40:45.912
You saved it for me
because you want to pretend

40:45.947 --> 40:47.180
to be my friend again.

40:47.215 --> 40:48.849
Louis, didn't you hear
Jessica's speech?

40:48.883 --> 40:50.443
This is our chance
wipe the slate clean.

40:50.452 --> 40:51.885
I did hear her speech,

40:51.919 --> 40:55.355
and I know that she sent you
here to say that to me.

40:55.389 --> 40:56.389
No one sent me here.

40:56.423 --> 40:58.024
I'm here
because I want to be here.

40:58.059 --> 41:01.261
You see, that's sweet.

41:01.295 --> 41:04.464
But how can I ever believe
a word you say?

41:04.498 --> 41:08.168
I want to know
if you ever thought once

41:08.202 --> 41:11.271
to tell me the truth about Mike.

41:11.305 --> 41:13.006
No, I didn't.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.374
Of course you didn't.

41:14.408 --> 41:16.209
- Because we're not friends.
- You're wrong.

41:16.244 --> 41:17.610
We are friends,

41:17.644 --> 41:20.347
but my professional loyalty
to Harvey comes above that,

41:20.381 --> 41:22.215
which is why
I never told anyone--

41:22.250 --> 41:26.285
Jessica, Rachel, anyone.

41:26.319 --> 41:28.020
So put yourself in my position

41:28.054 --> 41:30.655
and ask yourself,
what you would have done?

41:33.393 --> 41:35.327
I want you to tell me
something else.

41:35.362 --> 41:38.830
[sighs]
Yes. Anything.

41:38.865 --> 41:40.165
You ever sleep with Harvey?

41:40.200 --> 41:42.201
Wait. What?

41:42.235 --> 41:44.836
It's not
a professional question.

41:44.871 --> 41:46.939
It's a personal question.

41:46.973 --> 41:49.308
Can you put our so-called
friendship high enough

41:49.342 --> 41:51.510
to answer that one honestly?

41:51.544 --> 41:52.611
Louis--

41:52.645 --> 41:54.380
Because it's the only thing
I can think of

41:54.414 --> 41:57.749
to know if I can even begin
to trust you again.

42:00.553 --> 42:03.354
Once.

42:03.389 --> 42:05.323
That's my way of wiping
the slate clean.

42:05.357 --> 42:07.392
You can accept it or not.
