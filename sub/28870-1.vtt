02:38.025 --> 02:39.323
Come on. Let's go.

03:25.924 --> 03:27.558
I made eggs.

03:30.356 --> 03:32.654
So I'm gonna pick you up
after practice at five.

03:32.656 --> 03:33.654
Six.

03:33.656 --> 03:34.821
I wanna shoot around.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.991
Is that Chad kid
still giving you trouble?

03:38.389 --> 03:39.391
Nope.

03:40.491 --> 03:41.925
Okay.

03:44.191 --> 03:47.324
Hey, Sammy. Sammy, come on.

03:48.790 --> 03:50.556
So I was thinking,

03:50.990 --> 03:53.857
- How about I call your coach?
- No! Hell no!

03:54.491 --> 03:55.891
Language.

03:57.958 --> 03:59.391
Good morning.

04:00.057 --> 04:01.822
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.724
Good morning.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.288
Hey, Dad.

04:08.723 --> 04:11.954
So, the Warriors are playing

04:11.956 --> 04:14.188
the Thunder tomorrow
in Oklahoma City.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.788
What do you think
is gonna happen?

04:15.790 --> 04:18.488
Well, Steph Curry just scored
thirty-two points last night.

04:18.988 --> 04:20.786
So what I think is that,

04:20.789 --> 04:23.856
Chef Curry is gonna
whomp on 'em.

04:23.858 --> 04:26.822
I don't know.
Durant's pretty good.

04:26.824 --> 04:28.825
He is the reigning MVP.

04:30.556 --> 04:31.591
John.

04:36.990 --> 04:38.890
Is somebody gonna bless
our food?

04:39.956 --> 04:41.824
Okay. Well, I guess I will.

04:46.157 --> 04:50.357
Lord, though he exasperates me
to no end,

05:20.773 --> 05:22.406
I am grateful for my son.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.075
For I know that you've
created him for a purpose,

05:26.506 --> 05:28.537
thus far only known to you.

05:31.974 --> 05:34.772
Bless this food
to our bodies. Amen.

05:34.774 --> 05:36.008
- Amen.
- Amen.

05:40.806 --> 05:42.504
I'm thinking about
raising your allowance

05:42.506 --> 05:43.938
to 100 bucks a week.

06:11.674 --> 06:12.673
What are you doing?

06:13.007 --> 06:15.507
Your mom is just trying to get
her son's attention.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.974
Hey, John.

06:24.205 --> 06:26.273
- Wassup, guys?
- Hug.

06:33.407 --> 06:34.541
Please go.

06:37.773 --> 06:38.905
Oh.

06:38.907 --> 06:40.237
Hey, Mrs. J.

06:40.239 --> 06:42.672
Hey, Chayla. Hey, Emma.
How are you girls?

06:42.674 --> 06:44.007
Living the dream, Mrs. J.

06:44.307 --> 06:46.070
Oh, I tried to friend you
on the Instagram,

06:46.072 --> 06:47.906
but I must be doing
something wrong.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.038
Oh, my God!

06:49.040 --> 06:50.707
Please, just go, Ma.

06:50.907 --> 06:52.670
I'm kidding!

06:52.672 --> 06:53.837
Have a good day!

06:53.839 --> 06:54.840
Bye!

06:57.974 --> 06:59.474
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

07:02.773 --> 07:04.939
Good morning, students.

07:04.941 --> 07:08.305
<i>Today is Thursday, January 15th.</i>

07:08.307 --> 07:11.038
<i>Yearbook committee
meets after school today.</i>

07:11.040 --> 07:14.804
<i>And there's a basketball game
at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.</i>

07:14.806 --> 07:15.938
Go Eagles!

07:15.940 --> 07:17.140
Yeah! Go Eagles!

07:18.107 --> 07:19.106
<i>Lastly,</i>

07:19.306 --> 07:22.438
a reminder that Monday
is a national holiday

07:22.440 --> 07:26.840
in remembrance of
Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.

07:27.173 --> 07:29.604
Emma and I got tickets
to see the musical <i>Hairspray</i>

07:29.606 --> 07:30.970
at the Fox Saturday night.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.037
Wow! Yeah, that sounds like fun.

07:33.039 --> 07:34.572
Mmm, dudes in tights.

07:34.574 --> 07:35.307
It's not a ballet.

07:35.641 --> 07:37.706
Look, I'm pretty sure
they'll be wearing pants.

07:38.106 --> 07:39.607
So what are you guys doing?

07:40.039 --> 07:41.938
We're crashing at Rieger's
after the game.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.438
- So jealous.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

07:43.440 --> 07:45.373
<i>Please stand
for the Pledge of Allegiance.</i>

07:45.840 --> 07:47.605
<i>Place your right hand
over your heart.</i>

07:47.607 --> 07:48.939
<i>Ready? Begin.</i>

07:49.139 --> 07:51.205
I pledge allegiance
to the Flag

07:51.207 --> 07:53.337
of the United States of America

07:53.339 --> 07:55.804
and to the Republic
for which it stands

07:55.806 --> 07:58.339
one Nation under God

07:58.341 --> 07:59.938
indivisible

07:59.940 --> 08:03.139
with liberty and justice
for all.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.271
We might have
some girls over, too.

08:06.273 --> 08:09.237
- Who?
- Can't say until it happens.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.040
- But they're hot.
- Totally.

08:12.539 --> 08:14.004
Hey, whoa. You're joking, right?

08:14.006 --> 08:15.139
No.

08:15.373 --> 08:17.571
Josh Rieger,
Josh Sanders, quiet please.

08:17.573 --> 08:21.339
Okay, gang. Family oral history
reports continue.

08:21.706 --> 08:24.139
Yesterday we heard
from Chad Green,

08:24.373 --> 08:26.741
whose family came over
on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

08:26.940 --> 08:29.074
My husband's family did as well.

08:29.373 --> 08:33.139
His great-great-grandfather
was a knight of some kind.

08:33.773 --> 08:35.337
And then we heard from Chayla,

08:35.340 --> 08:38.169
whose family lineage includes
the birth of the blues

08:38.172 --> 08:39.639
in Memphis, Tennessee.

08:42.006 --> 08:44.473
John, would you do the honors
and kick us off, please?

08:45.441 --> 08:46.474
Didn't do it.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.440
Why not?

08:49.740 --> 08:51.173
I didn't have time.

08:57.573 --> 09:00.907
If you don't do the assignment,
you'll get a failing grade.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.973
"Yesterday is not ours
to recover,

09:06.207 --> 09:10.341
"but tomorrow is ours
to win or lose."

09:12.740 --> 09:14.306
Doreen, you're up.

09:23.706 --> 09:25.040
Oh, wow!

09:34.107 --> 09:36.470
<i>"My child,
you believe me for so little.</i>

09:36.472 --> 09:38.106
"Don't be so safe
in the things you pray."

09:38.340 --> 09:40.171
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Hey, lady.

09:40.173 --> 09:41.805
- Hey, morning.
- Morning, Joyce.

09:41.807 --> 09:43.441
The morning
got away from me.

09:44.206 --> 09:45.772
Does anyone need
any more coffee?

09:45.774 --> 09:46.873
- No, thank you.
- No, thanks.

09:47.273 --> 09:49.505
- Hey.
- What passage?

09:49.507 --> 09:50.540
Is everything all right?

09:51.573 --> 09:52.640
Not exactly.

09:53.541 --> 09:55.403
John's birthday
is coming up,

09:55.405 --> 09:56.240
Mmm-hmm.

09:56.441 --> 09:58.371
Oh, I remember those always
been hard for him.

09:58.373 --> 10:01.204
Yeah. It's like he's building
this wall between us.

10:01.206 --> 10:02.639
And I hate myself for it.

10:02.873 --> 10:05.071
I know he's hurting
and I just wanna fix it.

10:05.073 --> 10:06.804
They're always so much harder
to deal with

10:06.806 --> 10:07.904
once they start shaving.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.007
And then
they leave for college.

10:11.606 --> 10:12.506
Come on.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.938
Sorry, ladies.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.840
I did read the book twice.

10:18.073 --> 10:19.705
Uh, so where were we?

10:19.707 --> 10:21.271
Um, we were just talking about

10:21.273 --> 10:23.839
how Beth Moore is asking us
to pray boldly.

10:24.073 --> 10:28.270
So, what does it mean
to you all, "to pray boldly"?

10:28.272 --> 10:29.938
I don't know. It just seems,

10:29.940 --> 10:32.005
- Oh! Hey, ladies.
- Pastor.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.970
Uh, we need to use this room
for a staff meeting.

10:33.972 --> 10:35.406
You guys wrapping things up?

10:35.639 --> 10:36.740
Uh, no.

10:36.973 --> 10:39.771
Not for another 22 minutes.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.506
And I have a women's ministry
meeting here, back-to-back.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.072
Oh, um,

10:45.074 --> 10:47.672
I'm sorry, but I don't think
that's gonna work.

10:47.674 --> 10:48.674
I'm sorry?

10:48.873 --> 10:51.505
I reserved both times
on the sign-up sheet.

10:51.507 --> 10:53.970
Okay. All I have on
my calendar is staff meeting.

10:53.972 --> 10:56.905
Where's this elusive
sign-up sheet?

10:57.439 --> 10:59.607
Taped to the door
that you walked in.

11:01.707 --> 11:03.507
Been going on ten years now.

11:04.507 --> 11:05.907
Oh.

11:07.107 --> 11:09.739
Well, it's official.

11:10.306 --> 11:12.905
We're going digital, ladies.
See Maddy for details.

11:12.907 --> 11:16.172
Listen, I don't know
what you do in California,

11:16.174 --> 11:18.571
but I have been leading
this women's ministry meeting

11:18.573 --> 11:19.670
for over five years.

11:19.672 --> 11:20.837
We don't cancel meetings...

11:20.839 --> 11:22.205
I don't know
who's counting, Joyce,

11:22.207 --> 11:24.604
but I've been in ministry
for over ten years,

11:24.606 --> 11:25.937
including California.

11:25.939 --> 11:27.037
Hey, maybe you guys could use

11:27.039 --> 11:28.405
that Starbucks
around the corner?

11:28.407 --> 11:29.837
That'd be fun, right?

11:29.839 --> 11:30.772
Oh, are you paying?

11:32.173 --> 11:34.140
Well, I hadn't thought
about it, but, uh,

11:34.373 --> 11:35.440
Great.

11:36.406 --> 11:39.505
Okay, ladies,
let's get out of here

11:39.507 --> 11:41.973
because our new pastor,

11:42.405 --> 11:45.538
has more important business
to tend to.

11:45.540 --> 11:46.804
No, that's not true.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.072
I'm sorry, ladies. I promise,
this will not happen next week.

11:49.074 --> 11:50.238
Thank you, Pastor.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.372
And please, I've been asking
for six months.

11:52.374 --> 11:53.505
Call me Jason.

11:53.507 --> 11:54.836
We know, Pastor.

11:54.838 --> 11:56.606
Why are you so hard on him?

11:57.105 --> 11:58.637
That haircut, for one.

12:00.938 --> 12:02.137
Right here, right here.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.639
Good rebound.
Let's run, Eagle.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.204
Set up that offense.

12:06.206 --> 12:08.306
Spread out the floor.
Spread it out.

12:08.973 --> 12:11.372
Come on, John. Set it up.

12:11.374 --> 12:12.373
I'm open.

12:12.639 --> 12:13.970
Nice, nice.

12:13.972 --> 12:15.171
Yes! Good job, guys.

12:15.173 --> 12:17.373
Come on now,
spread it out. Defense.

12:17.872 --> 12:18.937
Hands up.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.407
Defense, defense.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.507
Hands up! Hands up.

12:22.739 --> 12:24.037
There you go.

12:24.039 --> 12:25.873
- Nice.
- Nice shot!

12:26.105 --> 12:28.473
Spread that floor.
There you go.

12:30.105 --> 12:31.204
Spread it out. Move it out.

12:31.206 --> 12:32.507
- Go, go, go.
- There they go.

12:32.740 --> 12:33.739
Watch him.

12:34.439 --> 12:36.772
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.973
Hands up on D now.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.304
Very nice, John! Nice steal.
There you go.

12:47.306 --> 12:48.506
Good job, John.

12:51.707 --> 12:53.604
Can't catch me,
so you gotta foul me?

12:53.606 --> 12:54.737
Whatever, <i>ese.</i>

12:54.739 --> 12:55.904
What'd you just call me?

12:55.906 --> 12:58.171
Knock it off!

12:58.173 --> 13:00.273
Next guy who swings is benched.

13:00.873 --> 13:03.307
Practice is over. Wash up.

13:04.474 --> 13:06.507
John, Chad, bring it here.

13:10.474 --> 13:12.107
What's up with you guys?

13:13.706 --> 13:16.404
John beat you out for starting guard, Chad.
Deal with it.

13:16.406 --> 13:17.671
Temporary.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.438
Whatever. You wanna start,
better change schools.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.240
Enough!

13:21.606 --> 13:24.873
News flash.
You're not in the NBA yet.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.507
And acting like that,
you aren't ever gonna get there.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.407
Understood?

13:31.473 --> 13:32.939
All right, wash up.

13:34.173 --> 13:36.573
John, hold up. I wanna
talk to you for a minute.

13:38.474 --> 13:40.771
What's this I hear about
you getting a failing grade

13:40.773 --> 13:42.274
in your family history
assignment?

13:43.541 --> 13:44.540
Why does it matter?

13:45.006 --> 13:46.504
Well, unless
you figure it out,

13:46.506 --> 13:48.572
I'm gonna have to bench you
for Sunday's game.

13:48.574 --> 13:50.307
- What? That's bull...
- Hey.

13:52.340 --> 13:53.170
Whatever.

13:53.172 --> 13:54.541
You're a good player, John.

13:55.107 --> 13:57.039
But right now you're blowing it.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.340
What's going on with you lately?

14:05.406 --> 14:06.506
I'm cool.

14:06.873 --> 14:08.174
I'll see ya, Coach.

14:18.039 --> 14:20.541
Hey! How was practice?

14:22.373 --> 14:23.406
Fine.

14:31.540 --> 14:32.669
How was school?

14:32.671 --> 14:34.506
Oh, let me guess. Fine.

14:35.039 --> 14:36.639
What are you working on?

14:37.473 --> 14:38.573
Oral report.

14:39.406 --> 14:41.006
Maybe I could help.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.306
What are you saving 'em for?

14:51.906 --> 14:53.173
Your Jordans?

14:53.538 --> 14:55.139
When it's the right time.

15:02.241 --> 15:03.540
Okay.

15:23.474 --> 15:25.638
Baby, come back downstairs.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.640
All your friends are waiting
to sing "Happy Birthday" to you.

15:38.340 --> 15:39.540
What's wrong?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.006
Everybody's waiting.

15:43.739 --> 15:49.240
Why didn't she wanna
have a party for me?

15:51.505 --> 15:53.240
Why didn't she want me?

15:57.572 --> 15:58.837
For what it's worth,

15:58.839 --> 16:01.006
you have a purpose
and you are loved.

16:11.706 --> 16:13.237
Mr. Smith.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.340
Nice of you to join us
this morning.

16:16.973 --> 16:18.940
I'm ready to do my oral report.

16:22.206 --> 16:25.073
Okay, so, I'm John Smith.

16:25.407 --> 16:26.506
Uh,

16:26.873 --> 16:28.573
Most of you know I'm adopted.

16:29.173 --> 16:32.173
I come from a small town
in Guatemala called Sansare.

16:32.406 --> 16:33.640
Um...

16:34.339 --> 16:37.106
I don't know
who my biological mother is,

16:38.173 --> 16:40.204
but just that
she didn't want me.

16:40.206 --> 16:41.374
Uh,

16:44.073 --> 16:47.170
Joyce and Brian Smith adopted me
when I was nine months old.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.937
They went down there
on a missions trip

16:48.939 --> 16:51.273
and they ended up
coming home with me.

16:52.239 --> 16:53.906
Probably because I'm so cute.

16:57.273 --> 16:58.373
But yeah,

17:13.438 --> 17:14.371
Okay, okay.

17:14.373 --> 17:15.904
Brian,
that space right there.

17:15.906 --> 17:17.239
Okay, I'm on it.
I'm on it.

17:21.204 --> 17:23.006
- Okay.
- Hey, guys.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.405

Thank you.

19:23.839 --> 19:25.205
You were amazing.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.270
Hey, let's give it up
for our guest.

19:27.272 --> 19:29.373
Rob, thank you so much.

19:29.973 --> 19:31.638
So dope, and thank you.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.573
Show of hands. Who here,

19:34.207 --> 19:36.272
including me and my wife,
by the way,

19:36.805 --> 19:39.305
are addicted to <i>The Bachelor?</i>

19:42.672 --> 19:43.906
Okay.

19:45.172 --> 19:46.207
Liars.

19:47.438 --> 19:51.206
Liars! I know there's way more
of you out there than that.

19:51.606 --> 19:52.970
It's a sin to lie, people.

19:52.972 --> 19:55.973
It's even a worse sin
to lie in church, so...

19:57.172 --> 19:58.206
Okay.

19:59.173 --> 20:00.040
Cathy?

20:00.272 --> 20:02.071
I'mma pick on you for a second.

20:02.073 --> 20:03.536
Cathy, I happen to know,

20:03.538 --> 20:05.771
because I overheard it in
a supermarket checkout line,

20:05.773 --> 20:07.373
that you watch
<i>Bachelor in Paradise.</i>

20:07.606 --> 20:11.270
Now nobody watches just
<i>Bachelor in Paradise.</i>

20:11.272 --> 20:13.940
I'm sorry, that's like saying
I go to Arby's...

20:14.273 --> 20:16.373
you know, just for the salads.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.171
Yes, I do watch it.

20:19.173 --> 20:20.671
Okay, that's what I thought.

20:20.673 --> 20:23.138
And I bet that means that your
husband, Bob, watches it too.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.239
Bob, I get it. I get it.

20:24.538 --> 20:26.303
At first, it was 'cause she
forced you to do it, right?

20:26.305 --> 20:28.269
You got hooked.
You got a problem now, right?

20:28.271 --> 20:31.469
You're like, "How is Andy ever
gonna find true love?" Right?

20:33.305 --> 20:35.372
Remember this guy last season,
Juan Pablo?

20:35.907 --> 20:36.806
This guy.

20:37.204 --> 20:39.606
You know what really
ticked me off about this guy?

20:41.405 --> 20:43.603
He kept asking these women
to make a commitment,

20:43.605 --> 20:44.839
week after week.

20:45.439 --> 20:47.670
But when it came time for him
to make a commitment,

20:47.672 --> 20:49.239
he chickened out, right?

20:49.838 --> 20:51.972
He kept saying,
"Will you accept my rose?

20:52.205 --> 20:54.306
"Will you accept my rose?
Will you...?"

20:54.739 --> 20:57.405
But when someone asked him
to get up to the plate...

20:57.940 --> 20:59.406
he couldn't find the courage
to do it.

20:59.705 --> 21:02.372
I'm pretty sure you guys all
know where I'm going with this,

21:02.672 --> 21:03.706
but it's true.

21:04.406 --> 21:07.405
Week after week
He's there for us.

21:08.571 --> 21:12.504
And, yeah, God is asking
for a lifetime commitment too.

21:12.506 --> 21:15.572
But here's the good news,
and I do mean the good news.

21:16.838 --> 21:19.205
He didn't just give us
a rose, right?

21:22.872 --> 21:26.138
He gave us
the most valuable thing

21:26.807 --> 21:28.206
that He had to give.

21:30.639 --> 21:31.939
His son.

21:35.172 --> 21:37.536
And I think that means
that we probably

21:37.538 --> 21:40.105
shouldn't be commitment-phobes
either, right?

21:44.006 --> 21:46.238
All right,
let's open our Bibles.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.805
The Gospel of Luke.

21:48.972 --> 21:50.370
You coming
to the game tonight?

21:50.372 --> 21:52.704
No. I'm not gonna
be able to make it, Joyce.

21:52.706 --> 21:53.870
Hey, Joyce!

21:53.872 --> 21:56.037
- Paula, how are you?
- Hi. So good to see you.

21:56.039 --> 21:57.737
You too. Thank you.

21:57.739 --> 21:59.606
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

22:00.540 --> 22:01.506
Hi, Joyce.

22:02.339 --> 22:04.871
Oh, what do you guys have on
for the rest of the day?

22:04.873 --> 22:06.703
Uh, well, John's got
a basketball game.

22:06.705 --> 22:09.704
Oh, yeah? I've seen John hoop
it up a little bit around here.

22:09.706 --> 22:11.239
This guy's a beast!

22:11.606 --> 22:13.069
What do you say, J-Money?

22:13.071 --> 22:15.006
Coming to Youth Group this week?

22:15.639 --> 22:18.004
Weak sauce! Come on!

22:18.006 --> 22:19.204
All right, I'll come.

22:19.206 --> 22:21.540
Boom! There we go.
This kid is so...

22:22.772 --> 22:23.906
lit!

22:25.772 --> 22:28.102
I've no idea
what you're going on about,

22:28.104 --> 22:29.937
but we have got to go.

22:29.939 --> 22:32.103
- Nice sermon today, Pastor.
- Thanks, Brian.

22:32.105 --> 22:33.540
Hey, uh, call me Jason.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.272
Jason.

22:35.705 --> 22:37.504
Take it, John, take it!

22:39.672 --> 22:40.838
Good job.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.040
Let's go, Eagles! Let's go!

22:44.740 --> 22:45.871
They gotta hold 'em.

22:45.873 --> 22:47.172
Come on, defense!

22:49.739 --> 22:51.170
Let's go, defense!

22:51.172 --> 22:52.871
You need to spread it out!

22:52.873 --> 22:54.773
- Here we go, yeah, John!
- Good job.

22:55.204 --> 22:57.007
Okay, now,
look at the clock.

22:58.573 --> 23:00.106
John, set up Eagle!

23:00.473 --> 23:02.440
Come on, John! Set it up!

23:03.606 --> 23:04.571
- Get back!
- Eagle!

23:04.573 --> 23:06.603
John, he's open!
Pass it to him!

23:06.605 --> 23:07.870
- Eagle!
- Three!

23:07.872 --> 23:09.873
- John!
- Two!

23:10.138 --> 23:11.339
One!

23:14.739 --> 23:16.937
Yeah! Oh, yeah, John.

23:16.939 --> 23:18.471
John Smith!

23:21.906 --> 23:23.871
That was a good game,
but next time I call a play

23:23.873 --> 23:25.605
you better listen to me,
you hear me?

23:25.905 --> 23:27.973
All right, go wash up.
Good game!

23:32.272 --> 23:33.705
You got 'em from here?

23:33.905 --> 23:34.970
We do.

23:34.972 --> 23:36.603
We're gonna grab pizza
on the way home.

23:36.605 --> 23:37.804
Great. Thank you, Cindy.

23:37.806 --> 23:39.302
- Any time.
- Good game.

23:39.304 --> 23:40.305
You too.

23:41.271 --> 23:42.904
Text your mom tomorrow,
and tell her

23:42.906 --> 23:44.669
when and where
to pick you up, okay?

23:44.671 --> 23:46.406
Please, don't forget.

23:46.605 --> 23:47.637
I won't.

23:47.639 --> 23:49.003
It was a good game, son.

23:49.005 --> 23:50.238
Yeah.

23:50.739 --> 23:52.105
Have a great time.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.971
And, uh, don't do
anything stupid.

23:55.973 --> 23:57.340
Okay, Brian.

23:58.005 --> 23:59.270
Love you, guys.

24:02.272 --> 24:04.239
I'm sorry,
you're okay with that?

24:05.406 --> 24:06.737
It's just a phase.

24:06.739 --> 24:08.971
He's just trying
to get a reaction.

24:09.305 --> 24:11.937
By calling you Brian? Or not
hugging his mother goodbye?

24:11.939 --> 24:13.506
A little bit of both.

24:14.139 --> 24:15.740
He just needs some space,

24:16.171 --> 24:19.238
and maybe we should
loosen up a bit.

24:19.740 --> 24:23.273
Listen, you can't be his father
and his best friend, Brian.

24:24.171 --> 24:24.939
Why not?

24:25.372 --> 24:27.439
Because it doesn't work
that way.

24:35.139 --> 24:37.604
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- You want to see this drift?

24:37.606 --> 24:38.570
- Ready?
- Yeah.

24:40.971 --> 24:42.605
Abby just liked my post.

24:43.037 --> 24:46.037
She's cool.
I mean, she's no Molly, but,

24:46.039 --> 24:48.306
Molly?
She moved to Texas.

24:48.505 --> 24:50.906
So? She texts me,
like, all the time.

24:51.472 --> 24:52.571
Almost there.

24:54.605 --> 24:56.205
Big dub!

24:56.839 --> 24:58.606
- Come play, John.
- In a minute.

24:58.838 --> 25:00.038
All right.

25:07.004 --> 25:09.638
Oh! You were an ugly baby.

25:09.838 --> 25:11.705
That's not me, fool.
That's my dad.

25:11.971 --> 25:13.303
I'm the other one.

25:13.305 --> 25:16.339
My mom thinks it's funny
'cause we look exactly alike.

25:17.739 --> 25:19.506
You do,
and you're both ugly.

25:20.171 --> 25:21.872
- Hey, guys?
- Yeah, Mom?

25:22.238 --> 25:24.205
Let's not stay up
all night, okay?

25:24.606 --> 25:25.770
Night, Mrs. Rieger.

25:25.772 --> 25:27.138
Good night, boys.

25:37.839 --> 25:39.239
Cool! Let's go!

25:44.205 --> 25:45.339
Whoo!

25:49.904 --> 25:51.571
Right here.
Right here. Right here.

25:51.573 --> 25:52.639
Go! Go! Go! Hold up!

25:54.172 --> 25:56.036
- Pass it.
- Yeah.

25:56.038 --> 25:57.705
That's for little kids!

25:57.707 --> 25:58.706
Pass.

25:59.471 --> 26:01.070
Hey, get on this thing.
Get on this thing.

26:01.072 --> 26:02.970
- Wait for me.
- Push me.

26:02.972 --> 26:04.570
- Go! Go! Go!
- Spin him! Spin him!

26:06.739 --> 26:08.902
Keep going! Go faster!

26:08.904 --> 26:10.506
Okay! Okay! Stop it!

26:11.839 --> 26:13.873
I'm dizzy! I'm dizzy!
I'm dizzy!

26:15.306 --> 26:17.071
Hey, guys.
Let's check out the lake!

26:17.073 --> 26:18.573
Oh, my God!

26:22.240 --> 26:23.273
Okay, let's go.

26:27.239 --> 26:28.405
Check this out!

26:32.372 --> 26:34.203
- Yeah, we're good.
- Plenty thick.

26:34.205 --> 26:35.106
Let's go.

26:39.406 --> 26:40.572
I'm still dizzy!

26:41.606 --> 26:42.970
Come on! Don't be a wuss!

26:42.972 --> 26:45.073
- Yeah, come on!
- Let's play tag.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.005
Tag him.

26:48.839 --> 26:50.473
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

26:51.439 --> 26:52.570
Tag! You're it!

26:52.572 --> 26:53.738
Let's go!

26:55.506 --> 26:56.737
Come on!

26:56.739 --> 26:58.737
Go, go, go!

27:02.972 --> 27:05.470
- The puck is loose!
- Come here!

27:05.472 --> 27:06.573
John's got it!

27:07.105 --> 27:08.038
Goal!

27:18.238 --> 27:20.303
Okay, say, "Eagles."
Three!

27:20.305 --> 27:21.905
Two! One!

27:22.138 --> 27:23.173
Eagles!

27:25.506 --> 27:26.607
Tag him! Tag him!

27:27.339 --> 27:28.973
- I'm on it.
- No!

27:30.272 --> 27:31.768
Oh, he's slipping!
Get him!

27:31.770 --> 27:33.469
- No!
- Yeah!

27:33.471 --> 27:36.437
- Yo! No way! No way!
- Stay down. Yeah!

27:36.439 --> 27:38.770
Whoa! It's slippery,
guys. Watch out.

27:38.772 --> 27:39.903
We got you.

27:39.905 --> 27:41.270
Hey, boys!

27:41.272 --> 27:42.405
Get off the ice!

27:42.673 --> 27:43.772
Not safe!

27:44.172 --> 27:46.506
We're training
for the Olympics, sir.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.606
Please don't be a dream killer.

27:48.972 --> 27:50.069
Maybe he's right.

27:50.071 --> 27:51.403
Have you heard a single crack?

27:51.405 --> 27:54.103
Guys? Now,
or I'm calling the cops.

27:54.105 --> 27:55.139
Yes, sir.

27:55.439 --> 27:57.037
We just need
to catch our friend first.

27:57.039 --> 27:58.171
What? No, hey!

27:58.173 --> 27:59.105
- Get him!
- Get back here.

27:59.304 --> 28:00.736
- Not it. Stop!
- Oh, my God!

28:00.738 --> 28:02.136
Pin him down.
Pin him down.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.303
Yo, easy! Come on!

28:06.305 --> 28:07.137
Hey! Hey!

28:07.139 --> 28:09.104
You got me, okay?

28:09.106 --> 28:10.472
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yo, stop!

28:51.748 --> 28:53.144
Josh, hold on!

28:53.146 --> 28:56.145
I can't! I can't hold on.
My hands are too cold.

28:56.147 --> 28:58.578
- I'm slipping. I'm slipping.
- Hold on, Rieger, hold on!

28:58.580 --> 29:00.112
- I can't get up!
- Just breathe!

29:00.114 --> 29:01.211
Here. I'll push you out!

29:01.213 --> 29:03.613
Here. I got you. Hold on!

29:08.080 --> 29:09.547
John!

29:09.847 --> 29:11.144
Hey, John!

29:11.146 --> 29:13.013
John!
Grab my hand, John!

29:13.015 --> 29:14.312
- John!
- John!

29:14.314 --> 29:16.345
- Swim, come on!
- John! John!

29:16.347 --> 29:18.078
He went under.
I can't see his face!

29:18.080 --> 29:19.513
- Help!
- Where'd he go?

29:21.381 --> 29:23.114
Swim!
You can do it.

29:26.046 --> 29:27.047
John!

29:35.379 --> 29:37.044
Please, someone help!

29:37.046 --> 29:38.348
John!

29:53.113 --> 29:54.780
Please, someone!

30:02.447 --> 30:03.544
Help!

30:03.546 --> 30:04.979
<i>9-1-1,
what's your emergency?</i>

30:04.981 --> 30:07.412
Three boys,
they fell through the ice.

30:07.414 --> 30:08.778
You gotta send help right now!

30:08.780 --> 30:10.144
<i>All available trucks,</i>

30:10.146 --> 30:12.379
<i>we have a drowning event
at Lake Saint Louis.</i>

30:12.381 --> 30:14.110
<i>Call out locations please. Over.</i>

30:14.112 --> 30:15.377
- Move!
- Let's go!

30:25.114 --> 30:27.745
Truck 11, we're at the station
seven minutes out.

30:27.747 --> 30:29.948
We're inbound with
water rescue gear. Over.

30:38.547 --> 30:39.546
Where are they?

30:39.913 --> 30:41.579
Just down there. Right over there!
Thirty yards out.

30:41.581 --> 30:42.814
All right.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.911
<i>East entrance.
Thirty yards off shore.</i>

30:50.913 --> 30:52.979
<i>Local police have arrived
on scene.</i>

30:52.981 --> 30:55.345
<i>One out, one in the water,
one under the ice.</i>

30:55.347 --> 30:56.478
How long?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.711
<i>Approximately five
to seven minutes,</i>

30:57.713 --> 30:59.014
<i>according to witnesses.</i>

31:01.246 --> 31:03.380
Copy. Tell Chief
we're two minutes out.

31:11.947 --> 31:13.479
- Help us!
- Whoa!

31:13.481 --> 31:15.780
- She's breaking under me.
- Stay back! I'll go!

31:17.412 --> 31:19.279
Stay there!
We're coming to get you!

31:27.012 --> 31:28.279
Please help us. Hurry!

31:32.413 --> 31:33.912
Hurry! Please!

31:33.914 --> 31:35.145
Please, help us.

31:35.413 --> 31:37.078
I can't hold on
much longer.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.011
He's under the water.

31:38.013 --> 31:39.681
Let me get your friend.
I'll get you next.

31:40.514 --> 31:42.513
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

31:43.012 --> 31:44.310
Come on, I got ya.

31:44.312 --> 31:45.379
Thank you.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.844
Okay. Okay.

31:46.846 --> 31:48.177
Come on!

31:53.080 --> 31:55.178
Let's get the pike pole,
so we can drag the bottom.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.245
- We need more!
- How many do we need?

31:57.247 --> 31:58.977
I know this area of the lake.

31:58.979 --> 32:00.611
Ten, maybe 12 feet deep.

32:00.613 --> 32:02.412
- Grab three!
- Got it.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.444
- Still got one under, Chief?
- Yeah.

32:04.446 --> 32:07.011
But dive and retrieval
with tanks are inbound.

32:07.013 --> 32:08.645
The crack's widening.

32:08.647 --> 32:10.645
We've gotta get the other kid
away from the edge.

32:10.647 --> 32:12.778
- How's yours?
- Hypothermic, but still breathing.

32:12.780 --> 32:14.545
The ice is giving way.
Be careful!

32:14.547 --> 32:15.711
How long's mine been under?

32:15.713 --> 32:17.680
At least ten minutes
by our count!

32:20.414 --> 32:21.644
Please save him.

32:21.646 --> 32:23.045
He's under the water.

32:23.047 --> 32:25.745
He went under the water.
Please! His name is John.

32:25.747 --> 32:27.611
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Please! Please save him.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.779
I want you to crawl over
and grab this officer's hand.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.744
We're going to do everything
we can to find John.

32:31.746 --> 32:33.847
- Come on.
- Please find him.

32:39.246 --> 32:40.613
Easy getting in, Joe.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.715
We don't wanna push him
farther under.

32:46.380 --> 32:47.944
Let's work from back to front.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.614
Is the area widening,
or is it just me?

32:57.546 --> 32:59.013
It's getting bigger.

33:01.279 --> 33:03.815
Bottom contact's about ten feet.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.815
We gotta find this kid.

33:09.913 --> 33:11.014
Ready.

33:15.045 --> 33:16.179
What's the count?

33:16.414 --> 33:17.413
Fifteen minutes.

33:17.780 --> 33:20.143
It's gonna be a recovery,
not a rescue.

33:20.145 --> 33:21.845
Hey, EMT?

33:21.847 --> 33:23.210
Get your backpack.

33:23.212 --> 33:25.080
I need another backpack.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.747
- <i>Go back.</i>
- Go back.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.647
Sounds like Chief just said,
"Go back."

33:36.179 --> 33:37.244
I missed it.

33:41.912 --> 33:43.347
What's he talking about?

33:50.780 --> 33:53.179
I can't see past
three feet. It's way too murky.

33:53.580 --> 33:54.980
I don't wanna cut him.

33:57.813 --> 33:59.778
Tommy, if he went
under the ice back there,

33:59.780 --> 34:00.547
he's a goner.

34:00.815 --> 34:03.579
The outmost edge drops off
to 25 feet or more.

34:06.614 --> 34:10.648
<i>Come on, John. Be here.</i>

34:17.047 --> 34:18.514
I got something.

34:19.079 --> 34:20.114
What is it?

34:20.846 --> 34:21.846
Is it him?

34:22.647 --> 34:23.411
Tommy?

34:27.179 --> 34:28.478
Don't lose him, Tommy.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.812
- Pull him up. Pull him up.
- We got him.

34:30.813 --> 34:31.579
We got him!

34:31.581 --> 34:32.945
I'm losing my grip.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.414
We got him!

34:40.580 --> 34:42.147
Crew, throw the line!

34:42.812 --> 34:44.512
Rope is out.
Prepare for retrieval.

34:44.514 --> 34:45.847
I got him.

34:47.513 --> 34:49.112
Pull!

34:49.114 --> 34:50.478
Here we go!

34:50.481 --> 34:51.578
Pull!

34:51.580 --> 34:53.679
Come on! Keep going!

34:57.146 --> 34:58.645
He has no pulse.

34:58.647 --> 35:00.448
Start compressions.

35:00.914 --> 35:01.880
Go! Go! Go!

35:04.147 --> 35:06.744
Two! Three! Four! Five!

35:06.746 --> 35:07.747
Stop!

35:13.080 --> 35:14.213
Pull! Pull!

35:14.446 --> 35:17.648
One! Two! Three! Four! Five...

35:20.212 --> 35:22.277
Nine! Ten! Eleven! Twelve...

35:31.013 --> 35:32.113
Ventilation tube.

35:32.379 --> 35:33.847
One! Two!

35:49.480 --> 35:50.913
Come on, John.

35:57.613 --> 35:58.346
Cindy!

35:58.614 --> 35:59.945
I've been expecting your call.

35:59.947 --> 36:02.378
<i>Joyce,
so there's been an accident.</i>

36:02.380 --> 36:04.110
<i>Uh, the boys were out
playing on the ice</i>

36:04.112 --> 36:05.079
<i>and they fell through.</i>

36:05.448 --> 36:07.745
<i>So you need to get
to the hospital right now.</i>

36:07.747 --> 36:10.114
<i>They have John there.
All the boys are there.</i>

36:23.680 --> 36:24.447
Hey!

36:24.879 --> 36:26.978
<i>I'm just picking up that
dimmer switch that you wanted.</i>

36:26.980 --> 36:27.880
Brian!

36:28.213 --> 36:29.379
- <i>John was in an accident.</i>
- Joyce.

36:29.780 --> 36:31.114
The boys fell through the ice!

36:31.380 --> 36:33.745
- <i>Joyce, Joyce. Slow down.</i>
- I'm going to St. Joseph West Hospital.

36:33.747 --> 36:34.778
Can you please meet me there?

36:34.979 --> 36:37.447
<i>Okay, okay.
I'll meet you there.</i>

36:46.913 --> 36:49.780
Joyce, calm down.

36:50.347 --> 36:51.680
Calm down.

37:01.513 --> 37:02.614
What do we know?

37:02.812 --> 37:05.411
Fourteen-year-old male,
unresponsive and pulseless.

37:05.413 --> 37:07.177
He was playing on the ice
and fell through.

37:07.179 --> 37:09.043
Five hundred cc bolus given.

37:09.045 --> 37:10.280
He's very cold to touch.

37:10.679 --> 37:13.013
Keith, take over
CPR compressions.

37:13.246 --> 37:15.313
Let's bolus him,
normal saline.

37:15.548 --> 37:18.812
Run the IV wide open.
We use a weight of 80 pounds.

37:19.113 --> 37:20.714
Prepare to give epinephrine.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.547
Epinephrine is in.

37:33.079 --> 37:34.413
Hold compressions.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.514
No pulse. Still cold.

37:38.713 --> 37:41.044
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
No response.

37:41.046 --> 37:42.177
Resume compressions.

37:42.179 --> 37:43.547
Prepare to give epinephrine.

37:45.613 --> 37:47.445
Epinephrine 0.38 milligrams.

37:47.447 --> 37:48.677
The temp is 88 degrees.

37:48.679 --> 37:50.744
How much long till
the next pulse check?

37:50.746 --> 37:51.446
Thirty seconds.

37:51.779 --> 37:53.345
Please, Lord.
Please, Lord Jesus.

37:53.347 --> 37:54.246
Please.

37:54.646 --> 37:56.045
Check pulse
at the next pulse check.

37:56.047 --> 37:57.811
If there is no pulse,
we're gonna shock him.

37:57.813 --> 37:59.978
Gotta try something.
Shock at a 150 joules.

37:59.980 --> 38:02.244
- Preparing to shock.
- Two minutes.

38:03.880 --> 38:04.779
No pulse.

38:04.980 --> 38:05.946
Everyone, clear.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.244
Shocking.

38:11.079 --> 38:11.979
No pulse.

38:12.513 --> 38:14.277
What's
the outside temperature?

38:14.279 --> 38:15.345
Low 50s.

38:15.347 --> 38:16.613
Lake water can't
be cold enough

38:16.812 --> 38:18.710
to have done his heart any good,
or his brain for that matter.

38:18.712 --> 38:19.979
Temp is up
to 90 degrees.

38:20.213 --> 38:22.610
- <i>Prepare to give epinephrine.</i>
- Epinephrine is in.

38:22.612 --> 38:24.578
Epinephrine,
0.38 milligrams.

38:24.580 --> 38:26.280
Think, Kent. Think.

38:26.746 --> 38:28.544
How much epi have we given?

38:28.546 --> 38:29.846
Eight doses, Doctor.

38:33.380 --> 38:34.680
Prepare to shock.

38:38.447 --> 38:39.747
Two minutes.

38:41.147 --> 38:42.314
No pulse.

38:42.779 --> 38:45.348
All right.
Everybody, clear.

38:46.846 --> 38:47.813
Shocking.

38:50.214 --> 38:51.213
No pulse.

38:51.479 --> 38:53.447
Temp is up to 95 degrees.

38:53.846 --> 38:54.946
He's warm.

38:57.381 --> 38:59.114
Total time
is 45 minutes, Doctor.

39:02.913 --> 39:04.080
Doctor Sutterer.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.414
There's...

39:10.181 --> 39:11.514
There's, uh...

39:12.313 --> 39:13.780
There's nothing more we can do.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.680
We'll wait on his mother.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.444
Keith, keep going.

39:30.446 --> 39:32.080
I'm not going anywhere, boss.

39:32.678 --> 39:34.814
Please, Lord.
Please, Lord Jesus.

39:54.846 --> 39:56.244
I'm here for John Smith.

39:56.246 --> 39:57.147
Okay.

39:57.346 --> 39:58.777
You can have a seat
right over there.

39:58.779 --> 40:00.777
We're just waiting
for his parents to arrive.

40:00.779 --> 40:02.046
I am his mother.

40:02.712 --> 40:03.779
I'm sorry.

40:04.113 --> 40:05.080
Just a moment.

40:14.846 --> 40:15.913
She's here.

40:16.179 --> 40:17.579
Should I bring her down?

40:18.645 --> 40:19.612
I'll go.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.676
- Joyce, I'm here.
- They won't let me see him!

40:41.678 --> 40:43.911
My John is in there and they
will not let me see him!

40:43.913 --> 40:44.613
Isn't that illegal?

40:44.845 --> 40:46.780
We just need
to be patient.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.544
- Joyce Smith?
- Yes? I'm Joyce.

40:50.546 --> 40:52.977
Hi. I'm Doctor Kent Sutterer.

40:52.979 --> 40:55.577
We're doing everything we can
for your son,

40:55.579 --> 40:57.081
but John isn't responding.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.410
What does that mean?

41:00.412 --> 41:01.546
Let me take you to him.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.447
Okay, team.

41:26.780 --> 41:27.914
Keith.

41:43.079 --> 41:44.913
Joyce, we'll be right outside.

42:02.080 --> 42:06.379
Please, uh, take as long
as you need to say goodbye.

42:11.247 --> 42:12.480
What?

42:29.411 --> 42:31.477
I don't understand.

42:31.479 --> 42:33.244
I don't understand.

42:33.246 --> 42:35.646
Um...

42:40.113 --> 42:41.978
I don't understand.

42:43.446 --> 42:46.077
I don't understand. I don't,

42:46.079 --> 42:47.380
No.

42:48.246 --> 42:50.779
No, no, no.

42:51.214 --> 42:52.513
No!

42:54.913 --> 42:56.113
No!

43:03.813 --> 43:07.245
No, no, no. God.

43:07.247 --> 43:09.376
Please, Jesus, please.

43:09.378 --> 43:11.145
Please, Jesus.

43:11.378 --> 43:14.113
My John. My John...

43:21.279 --> 43:24.444
Holy Spirit, I need you now.

43:24.446 --> 43:26.444
I need you now.

43:26.446 --> 43:29.613
Please, please,
don't take my son.

43:31.780 --> 43:33.711
Please! Please!

43:33.713 --> 43:36.309
Please bring life
back into John.

43:36.311 --> 43:37.576
Please!

43:37.578 --> 43:40.545
Please, God!
Please, please, please.

43:40.780 --> 43:44.343
Come, breathe life into John.

43:44.345 --> 43:47.446
Please, God...

43:48.012 --> 43:49.510
Please, God.

43:49.512 --> 43:51.477
Please, God.

43:51.479 --> 43:54.443
Send your Holy
Spirit to save my son!

44:00.845 --> 44:02.910
- We've got a pulse!
- What?

44:02.912 --> 44:04.211
What?

44:04.213 --> 44:05.713
We've got a pulse!

44:06.611 --> 44:07.912
We've got a pulse! Trauma two.

44:08.180 --> 44:10.777
Page Respiratory and let
them know we need a ventilator.

44:10.779 --> 44:12.978
- You got a pulse?
- Yes.

44:12.980 --> 44:14.180
Prepare intubation.

44:14.445 --> 44:16.145
I'll get the NG
and be ready

44:16.147 --> 44:17.877
to insert it post-intubation.

44:22.081 --> 44:23.078
Joyce?

44:23.080 --> 44:24.177
Where's John?

44:24.179 --> 44:25.380
Joyce.

44:26.913 --> 44:28.178
Oh, Brian.

44:28.180 --> 44:29.611
- How's John?
- Well...

44:29.613 --> 44:32.577
John's got a pulse,
but it's weak.

44:32.579 --> 44:34.878
Now, we're doing everything
we can to stabilize him,

44:34.880 --> 44:36.011
and we're airlifting him

44:36.013 --> 44:38.211
to Cardinal Glennon
downtown right now.

44:38.213 --> 44:40.513
They've got the foremost expert
in drowning, Doctor Garrett.

44:40.780 --> 44:43.847
Now, in my opinion,
he's John's only chance.

44:44.312 --> 44:46.677
ATC, this is Cardinal
Glennon 3-3-4 airlift wing.

44:46.679 --> 44:48.578
I'll follow you there,
honey!

44:48.580 --> 44:50.376
<i>Go for CGCH.</i>

44:50.378 --> 44:53.077
We're requesting
a flight program now.

44:53.079 --> 44:54.778
<i>I have you
coming in at pad two</i>

44:54.780 --> 44:56.880
<i>with escort and trauma support
staff to assist.</i>

44:59.046 --> 45:01.213
Ma'am, are you able to fly?

45:01.612 --> 45:03.778
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

45:04.045 --> 45:05.679
You're hyperventilating.

45:07.112 --> 45:08.710
I'm scared to death of heights.

45:08.712 --> 45:11.077
I think it might be better
if you traveled by car.

45:11.079 --> 45:12.776
No, I'm not gonna leave my son!

45:12.778 --> 45:13.812
Okay!

45:30.179 --> 45:31.377
Hey, babe!

45:31.379 --> 45:32.778
<i>You'll be proud of me.
I'm jogging off that...</i>

45:32.780 --> 45:34.477
John Smith fell through
a frozen lake!

45:34.479 --> 45:35.379
Wait, what?

45:35.647 --> 45:36.977
They're airlifting him
to Cardinal Glennon.

45:36.979 --> 45:38.011
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

45:38.013 --> 45:39.480
I'm on my way.

45:48.380 --> 45:50.276
- You're John's mother, right?
- Yes.

45:50.278 --> 45:51.710
I need you
to come with me, ma'am.

45:51.712 --> 45:53.944
Doctor Garrett will be
the physician attending to John.

45:53.946 --> 45:55.346
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:58.713 --> 46:00.810
We'll come find you as soon
as we get him situated.

46:00.812 --> 46:03.276
- Okay.
- You can have a seat right over there.

46:04.746 --> 46:07.647
Smith family.
He was helicoptered in from St. Joseph.

46:10.646 --> 46:11.779
Uh, she's here now, so...

46:12.046 --> 46:13.978
We'll let you know
as soon as we hear something.

46:13.980 --> 46:15.077
Thank you.

46:17.947 --> 46:20.779
It's really not
a good time right now.

46:21.512 --> 46:23.013
Yeah, I know, Joyce.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.081
That's why I'm here.

46:25.912 --> 46:27.713
Well, thanks for coming.

46:29.212 --> 46:30.646
Well, I'm not leaving.

46:31.346 --> 46:32.843
Not now, anyway.

46:32.845 --> 46:33.913
Excuse me?

46:34.546 --> 46:36.611
Look, Joyce.
I know you might not be

46:36.613 --> 46:38.279
the biggest fan
of how I preach,

46:38.513 --> 46:39.914
or my haircut.

46:40.913 --> 46:43.510
But I'm John's pastor.
And I'm your pastor.

46:43.512 --> 46:44.744
I think that means
that right now,

46:44.746 --> 46:46.144
we gotta set aside
our differences.

46:46.146 --> 46:48.047
We gotta focus on John. Right?

46:50.079 --> 46:51.513
Brian!

46:55.078 --> 46:56.379
Thank you for coming.

47:01.380 --> 47:03.747
Yes, Doctor.
We've increased the drip rate.

47:06.913 --> 47:08.579
<i>I'm Doctor Garrett.</i>

47:09.513 --> 47:11.980
I'm sorry to be meeting
under these circumstances.

47:15.112 --> 47:16.680
Your son is alive,

47:17.246 --> 47:18.913
but his pulse
is very, very weak.

47:20.478 --> 47:23.146
John's brain, like his organs,

47:23.780 --> 47:26.242
was deprived of oxygen
for at least 20 minutes

47:26.244 --> 47:28.612
before CPR was administered.

47:29.478 --> 47:31.645
His injuries are catastrophic.

47:32.245 --> 47:35.013
Beyond rudimentary
brain function...

47:37.445 --> 47:39.211
I've never seen
a case like John's.

47:39.845 --> 47:41.376
The fact that he's made it
this far...

47:41.378 --> 47:42.580
I'm sorry.

47:42.846 --> 47:43.977
"This far"?

47:43.979 --> 47:45.113
Doctor?

47:47.647 --> 47:50.013
If John ever
regained consciousness...

47:51.513 --> 47:54.013
he'd be severely
neurologically impaired.

47:58.178 --> 48:00.412
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

48:01.479 --> 48:03.946
But I don't believe
John will survive the night.

48:06.646 --> 48:08.611
If you have family and friends

48:08.613 --> 48:11.413
that you want to call
to come to see John,

48:12.079 --> 48:13.913
now would be the time to do it.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.847
I've been told that you are
the best, Doctor Garrett.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.813
I'm an expert
in my field, ma'am.

48:27.279 --> 48:28.747
No, you're the best.

48:29.346 --> 48:31.447
World renowned, in fact.

48:33.979 --> 48:35.579
Or was I misinformed?

48:37.179 --> 48:38.647
No, you were not.

48:39.245 --> 48:41.512
I know that
you don't know my son,

48:42.445 --> 48:46.012
but my John is a fighter
and he doesn't give up.

48:47.312 --> 48:51.079
So, I need you to go
and be the best for John.

48:51.913 --> 48:53.379
Nothing less.

48:54.513 --> 48:56.746
And you just let God
do the rest.

49:06.579 --> 49:07.546
Okay.

49:09.145 --> 49:10.512
Okay.

49:11.280 --> 49:12.410
It's been
real touch and go.

49:12.412 --> 49:13.577
Can't tell us anything more?

49:13.579 --> 49:15.012
Here they are.

49:15.246 --> 49:16.480
Hey, Melissa.

49:17.278 --> 49:19.546
I'm so sorry, hon.

49:20.946 --> 49:23.176
We headed over
the minute we heard the news.

49:23.178 --> 49:24.846
What are they saying about John?

49:25.513 --> 49:26.778
Well, I'm not gonna say

49:26.780 --> 49:29.043
what the doctor
just tried to tell me,

49:29.045 --> 49:30.477
because I refuse to accept it.

49:30.479 --> 49:33.479
Because John is gonna
get through this.

49:35.246 --> 49:36.476
Joyce,

49:36.478 --> 49:38.110
I think you need
to be honest with yourself

49:38.112 --> 49:39.379
about John's chances.

49:39.613 --> 49:42.479
I am being honest
about his chances.

49:43.578 --> 49:46.478
You know, I'm gonna get back.

49:46.879 --> 49:49.177
They're only allowing two people
in the room at a time.

49:49.179 --> 49:50.380
Brian?

49:51.112 --> 49:52.277
Brian. Let's go.

49:52.279 --> 49:54.143
Oh, you and Jason go.

49:54.145 --> 49:55.345
I'll hang back.

49:55.911 --> 49:58.312
- Are you sure?
- Yes, thank you.

50:18.045 --> 50:19.580
How are the boys?

50:22.112 --> 50:26.611
Well, the two Joshes
were released a few hours ago.

50:26.613 --> 50:29.814
They suffered some hypothermia,
but they're gonna be fine.

50:30.245 --> 50:31.679
And John?

50:34.179 --> 50:38.714
John is in
a very tough spot, honey.

50:39.245 --> 50:40.978
But he's got a pulse,

50:42.445 --> 50:45.011
which is a lot more than
anyone thought possible.

50:45.679 --> 50:47.946
Mom said it was
some kinda miracle.

50:48.613 --> 50:49.579
Yeah.

50:50.413 --> 50:52.380
Yeah, yeah...

50:53.512 --> 50:57.612
I still don't know quite how
to put it into words.

50:59.546 --> 51:02.713
His mom, she was so emotional,
she was praying and...

51:04.678 --> 51:06.479
I still can't believe it.
He just...

51:07.045 --> 51:08.845
He just came back to life.

51:10.013 --> 51:11.946
So, John's gonna be okay?

51:13.579 --> 51:15.945
Your dad's had
a long day, honey.

51:16.346 --> 51:17.444
I know, but...

51:17.446 --> 51:19.680
what do I tell the kids
in my class?

51:20.412 --> 51:23.878
Well, honey, the truth is
nobody knows for sure.

51:25.079 --> 51:29.513
Is there a chance John will
be back to school this week?

51:29.879 --> 51:30.843
No, honey.

51:30.845 --> 51:34.547
He's gonna be
at Cardinal Glennon until...

51:39.778 --> 51:44.779
Honey, I don't think John
is gonna live much longer.

51:45.146 --> 51:47.613
But you said
he came back to life.

51:47.978 --> 51:48.945
I know.

51:49.747 --> 51:51.909
For now, honey.

51:51.911 --> 51:53.111
Yeah, for now.

51:53.113 --> 51:54.376
But it's...

51:54.378 --> 51:56.079
You know, it's complicated.

52:05.779 --> 52:08.413
I got an update
from the hospital.

52:08.845 --> 52:09.713
They, um...

52:10.045 --> 52:12.613
They don't expect that boy
to make it through the night.

52:16.144 --> 52:17.778
That was something today, bud.

52:19.112 --> 52:20.546
What you did.

52:21.346 --> 52:23.346
Well, if Chief hadn't asked us
to double back,

52:23.745 --> 52:26.044
never would've found him
in the first place.

52:26.046 --> 52:27.313
Say what?

52:28.011 --> 52:30.080
If you hadn't yelled for us
to go back.

52:31.278 --> 52:32.411
I thought you were nuts.

52:32.413 --> 52:33.776
I didn't yell at you guys.

52:33.778 --> 52:37.043
No, I was knee-deep in trying
to help those other boys

52:37.045 --> 52:39.045
not lose their fingers and toes.

52:43.146 --> 52:44.680
I never heard it.

52:45.512 --> 52:46.809
You're the one
who found him, Tommy.

52:46.811 --> 52:48.478
I helped you fish him out,
but...

52:48.945 --> 52:50.080
the rest was all you.

52:52.311 --> 52:54.778
I heard a voice say "Go back."

52:57.811 --> 52:58.978
So who was it?

53:00.312 --> 53:01.679
It wasn't me.

53:07.445 --> 53:10.012
You're messing with me, Chief.

53:10.579 --> 53:11.412
No.

53:11.711 --> 53:13.344
I'm just sitting here
listening to you

53:13.346 --> 53:14.777
trying to sound humble,

53:14.779 --> 53:16.613
which really doesn't suit you.

54:21.045 --> 54:24.245
<i>What I witnessed today
was something quite remarkable.</i>

54:24.580 --> 54:27.377
<i>Some might even call it
a miracle,</i>

54:27.379 --> 54:29.079
<i>which is why I'm writing.</i>

54:29.312 --> 54:31.009
<i>So that no matter what happens,</i>

54:31.011 --> 54:34.347
<i>we will remember
what we witnessed today.</i>

55:26.146 --> 55:27.976
My John made it
through the night.

55:27.978 --> 55:29.210
Yeah, of course he did.

55:29.212 --> 55:30.545
He's a fighter.

55:31.480 --> 55:35.079
Oh, I did some investigative
research with Brian.

55:35.346 --> 55:36.945
Two creams, one sugar.

55:37.179 --> 55:38.246
Thank you.

55:38.612 --> 55:40.878
And thank you for staying
the night, Jason.

55:45.644 --> 55:46.478
What?

55:46.745 --> 55:49.480
That's the first time
you've ever called me Jason.

55:51.579 --> 55:53.542
I'm sorry.
I've been awful to you.

55:53.544 --> 55:55.445
No! Come on.
What are you talking about?

55:55.645 --> 55:59.244
Who doesn't love
a typed, two-page,

55:59.246 --> 56:00.943
single-spaced,
anonymous complaint letter

56:00.945 --> 56:02.110
about the worship band?

56:02.112 --> 56:03.444
The rapper was a bit much.

56:03.446 --> 56:04.745
Okay.

56:04.979 --> 56:06.578
I grew up on hymns.

56:08.278 --> 56:10.045
Wait, how'd you know it was me?

56:11.845 --> 56:12.945
I didn't.

56:13.279 --> 56:14.644
So...

56:15.946 --> 56:18.577
Listen, Joyce. The only reason I
switched up the music at church

56:18.579 --> 56:20.177
is because I will do

56:20.179 --> 56:22.511
absolutely everything
and anything,

56:22.711 --> 56:25.745
to get young people psyched
to go to church.

56:26.378 --> 56:28.112
Kids like John, it's just...

56:28.378 --> 56:31.511
They need a little more cowbell,
you know?

56:34.178 --> 56:35.712
Yeah, I see your point.

56:36.446 --> 56:38.344
Oh, Paula must hate me.

56:38.346 --> 56:40.579
No. No, she thinks
you're very...

56:41.213 --> 56:42.578
spirited.

56:44.712 --> 56:46.946
Why don't you go home
and see your family?

56:47.245 --> 56:48.576
Are you sure?

56:48.578 --> 56:50.945
Yes, yes, of course.

56:51.544 --> 56:53.211
Good morning, everyone.

56:53.213 --> 56:54.179
Morning.

56:54.379 --> 56:55.877
Uh, call me if you need me
for anything.

56:55.879 --> 56:58.080
- I'll be back real soon.
- All right. Thanks.

56:59.878 --> 57:02.812
Uh, I just got the update
from Wendy.

57:04.779 --> 57:07.646
I don't know how John
made it through the night.

57:12.512 --> 57:14.346
But I'm glad I was wrong.

57:15.511 --> 57:17.978
I am worried
about cerebral edema.

57:21.545 --> 57:23.711
Like the rest of John's body,

57:24.278 --> 57:25.945
his brain's going
to wanna swell.

57:26.378 --> 57:28.378
I'm gonna keep John
in an induced coma,

57:28.944 --> 57:31.312
give his body a chance
to reverse course.

57:31.546 --> 57:33.909
And we're gonna run a lot of
tests today. Okay?

57:33.911 --> 57:36.845
It's imperative that we see
some kind of real proof

57:37.079 --> 57:38.812
of brain activity in John.

57:39.113 --> 57:40.347
Yeah.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.112
At best, we have
a long road ahead.

57:45.579 --> 57:47.579
And I'm not gonna lie to you.

57:48.213 --> 57:49.745
We're in uncharted territory.

57:55.812 --> 57:58.344
A fourteen-year-old
St. Charles boy,

57:58.346 --> 58:00.844
<i>who spent 15 minutes
trapped underwater,</i>

58:00.846 --> 58:03.610
<i>after falling through the ice
on Lake Saint Louis,</i>

58:03.612 --> 58:06.343
<i>is continuing to fight
for his life today.</i>

58:06.345 --> 58:07.910
<i>On Monday,
after first responders,</i>

58:07.912 --> 58:12.876
<i>recovered John Smith's
unresponsive and pulseless body,</i>

58:12.878 --> 58:15.942
<i>John was transported
to St. Joseph West Hospital,</i>

58:15.944 --> 58:19.776
<i>where the trauma team continued
life-saving CPR efforts,</i>

58:19.778 --> 58:22.377
<i>for an additional 45 minutes.</i>

58:22.611 --> 58:27.212
<i>It was then, that after an hour
with no signs of life,</i>

58:27.479 --> 58:30.078
<i>John's mother, Joyce, prayed.</i>

58:30.346 --> 58:31.743
<i>And John got a pulse.</i>

58:31.745 --> 58:34.011
<i>John was then
quickly airlifted here</i>

58:34.013 --> 58:35.643
<i>to Cardinal Glennon Hospital,</i>

58:35.645 --> 58:38.344
<i>where we're told that
Doctor Garrett and his team</i>

58:38.346 --> 58:40.343
<i>are working around the clock,</i>

58:40.345 --> 58:43.009
<i>in an effort to save
John Smith's life.</i>

58:43.011 --> 58:46.543
<i>This is Kay Quinn reporting live
from Cardinal Glennon Hospital.</i>

58:46.545 --> 58:47.545
Where's Jason?

58:47.944 --> 58:49.578
<i>And in other news,
yesterday, protesters...</i>

58:50.180 --> 58:51.645
I sent him home.

58:54.912 --> 58:56.979
You missed Doctor Garrett
this morning.

58:57.579 --> 58:59.679
No, he came and found me.

59:00.678 --> 59:04.112
Brian, you didn't come back
last night.

59:09.079 --> 59:11.478
I can't see him like this.

59:13.645 --> 59:15.611
I can't be in this room...

59:17.344 --> 59:19.112
seeing him in this state.

59:20.411 --> 59:21.979
I'm sorry.

59:24.344 --> 59:25.711
Um...

59:26.078 --> 59:27.442
If you need anything,

59:27.444 --> 59:29.411
I'll just be
right down the hall.

59:30.845 --> 59:32.112
I'm not leaving.

59:33.111 --> 59:34.345
Okay.

59:36.279 --> 59:38.079
Melissa thinks that everyone...

59:38.745 --> 59:40.409
is just waiting for John to die.

59:40.411 --> 59:41.445
That it's just...

59:42.046 --> 59:45.113
It's just taking longer
than they expected.

59:45.312 --> 59:47.679
- What do you think?
- I'm sorry but...

59:48.378 --> 59:49.611
I think she's right.

59:49.812 --> 59:53.710
I can see it in their face
and in everyone's face except...

59:53.712 --> 59:54.779
Mine?

59:56.345 --> 59:59.813
I believe God
can heal our son completely.

01:00:00.846 --> 01:00:02.080
I know you do.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.579
I know you do.

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:17.046
Why did you have to sleep
at the hospital?

01:00:18.046 --> 01:00:19.143
Well...

01:00:19.145 --> 01:00:20.576
Remember how I told you

01:00:20.578 --> 01:00:22.945
another word for "pastor"
can be "shepherd"?

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.679
Well, shepherds look after
their sheep, right?

01:00:28.111 --> 01:00:29.744
Is that why you always tell Mom

01:00:29.746 --> 01:00:32.179
the people at church
are acting like sheep?

01:00:34.112 --> 01:00:35.378
Um...

01:00:36.578 --> 01:00:38.344
Let's try not to repeat that.

01:00:38.746 --> 01:00:42.712
No, uh, John's like a sheep
that's been injured.

01:00:43.079 --> 01:00:46.079
And this is a real thing,
this really happens sometimes.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.343
Sometimes when a shepherd
finds a sheep

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.076
that's been injured
in his pasture,

01:00:50.078 --> 01:00:51.610
he'll actually pick him up,

01:00:51.612 --> 01:00:53.945
and he'll carry him
around his neck.

01:00:54.611 --> 01:00:55.310
Why?

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:59.946
Well, so that the sheep
can hear his heartbeat, right?

01:01:00.344 --> 01:01:02.511
And the two can form a bond.

01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:05.978
So you're gonna carry John
around your neck?

01:01:06.278 --> 01:01:07.911
Well, not literally.

01:01:07.913 --> 01:01:09.643
Um...

01:01:09.645 --> 01:01:12.378
I think I'm butchering
this metaphor.

01:01:12.611 --> 01:01:14.509
You guys, your dad
is going to the hospital

01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:15.809
to be by John's side.

01:01:15.811 --> 01:01:17.676
That way he can hear
your dad's voice

01:01:17.678 --> 01:01:19.479
and know
that your dad loves him.

01:01:19.778 --> 01:01:21.645
'Cause that is what pastors do.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:23.079
They love their people.

01:01:23.344 --> 01:01:24.977
Why didn't you just say that?

01:01:24.979 --> 01:01:26.512
Like, yeah.

01:01:28.445 --> 01:01:30.946
I have no idea.
I don't know.

01:01:31.211 --> 01:01:32.408
Why don't you go
brush your teeth?

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.275
I think your mom should be
the pastor, huh?

01:01:34.277 --> 01:01:35.376
Yup.

01:01:35.378 --> 01:01:37.945
Hey, hey, hey! Dishes?

01:01:38.177 --> 01:01:40.511
Oh, I know. Ooh, so rough.

01:01:41.012 --> 01:01:42.545
Thank you!

01:01:49.311 --> 01:01:51.345
Hey. What?

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:56.012
If John dies...

01:01:58.511 --> 01:02:00.577
I mean, it's gonna destroy her.

01:02:01.544 --> 01:02:04.345
She believes without a doubt
that he'll survive.

01:02:17.546 --> 01:02:19.145
Tommy.

01:02:19.511 --> 01:02:20.978
How you doing?

01:02:21.678 --> 01:02:23.045
What's on your mind, Chief?

01:02:23.377 --> 01:02:25.045
The guys think that, uh...

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.176
maybe you're still
a little shook up

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:29.679
about what happened
to the boy.

01:02:30.145 --> 01:02:31.679
I know what I heard.

01:02:32.846 --> 01:02:33.811
I believe you.

01:02:33.813 --> 01:02:35.011
A few feet over...

01:02:35.945 --> 01:02:38.710
That lake is, like, 25 feet deep
or more, right?

01:02:38.712 --> 01:02:39.576
Yeah.

01:02:39.578 --> 01:02:43.010
To find him like we did,
that fast?

01:02:43.012 --> 01:02:43.913
Million to one,

01:02:44.245 --> 01:02:45.546
best case.

01:02:48.212 --> 01:02:49.979
Anything like that
ever happen to you?

01:02:51.612 --> 01:02:52.679
No.

01:02:56.344 --> 01:02:57.778
Well...

01:02:58.378 --> 01:02:59.946
The way I figure it,

01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:02.611
it's either one of two things.

01:03:04.045 --> 01:03:05.278
Either I'm nuts...

01:03:05.478 --> 01:03:07.445
Or God's talking to you.

01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:10.478
Exactly.

01:03:15.045 --> 01:03:16.411
In which case...

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:18.978
I got a big personal problem.

01:03:19.844 --> 01:03:21.046
What's that?

01:03:21.879 --> 01:03:23.545
I don't believe in God.

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:25.777
Joyce thinks that John

01:03:25.779 --> 01:03:27.644
is gonna walk out
of this hospital.

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:29.112
What do you think?

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:36.946
I have my doubts,

01:03:38.144 --> 01:03:39.978
if that's what you're asking.

01:03:42.011 --> 01:03:43.545
That being said...

01:03:45.046 --> 01:03:46.645
I think it's possible.

01:03:49.778 --> 01:03:51.979
I've been researching
drowning cases,

01:03:52.511 --> 01:03:53.978
hundreds of them.

01:03:55.745 --> 01:03:58.746
No one in John's situation
has ever survived.

01:04:06.845 --> 01:04:08.411
I believe in God.

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:15.345
But maybe that only goes so far
with something like this.

01:04:18.677 --> 01:04:20.611
I'm gonna be honest with you.

01:04:22.544 --> 01:04:25.411
I have no idea what God
will do with John.

01:04:27.345 --> 01:04:29.346
I mean, I have no idea.

01:04:30.511 --> 01:04:32.710
All that I know is
that I'm supposed to walk

01:04:32.712 --> 01:04:34.945
alongside you and Joyce
right now.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.478
Best case scenario...

01:04:41.746 --> 01:04:45.112
is that my son leaves here
severely brain-damaged.

01:04:49.211 --> 01:04:50.913
Could you handle that?

01:05:12.244 --> 01:05:13.845
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:18.609
<i>I just think
we should be focused</i>

01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:19.977
<i>on the patients we can
actually help. Right?</i>

01:05:20.178 --> 01:05:22.511
<i>That isn't your call or mine.
It's Doctor Garrett's.</i>

01:05:22.745 --> 01:05:24.777
It is
neurologically impossible

01:05:24.779 --> 01:05:27.176
for the patient to change course
at this point.

01:05:27.178 --> 01:05:28.110
Be that as it may,

01:05:28.377 --> 01:05:29.776
our job is to meet
the needs of the patient,

01:05:29.778 --> 01:05:31.877
until Doctor Garrett
changes course

01:05:31.879 --> 01:05:33.210
or the patient expires.

01:05:33.444 --> 01:05:35.342
But the cerebral blood flow scan

01:05:35.344 --> 01:05:37.043
shows complete absence of...

01:05:38.445 --> 01:05:40.611
The patient's name is John.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:42.345
John Smith.

01:05:42.544 --> 01:05:44.111
Hello, I'm Doctor Lulu.

01:05:45.778 --> 01:05:46.478
Yeah.

01:05:47.012 --> 01:05:48.610
My colleagues and I were just
discussing your son's case.

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.075
Oh, I heard what
you were discussing.

01:05:50.077 --> 01:05:51.278
We thought we were alone.

01:05:51.578 --> 01:05:52.778
Of course you did.

01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:54.244
But I'm here,

01:05:54.512 --> 01:05:56.812
and my son is right
in front of you.

01:05:57.011 --> 01:06:00.244
And my son can hear you
whether you believe it or not.

01:06:00.479 --> 01:06:02.479
So from now on,

01:06:03.012 --> 01:06:04.078
I don't want anybody

01:06:04.379 --> 01:06:06.679
saying anything negative
about his prognosis

01:06:06.945 --> 01:06:07.978
in this room.

01:06:10.579 --> 01:06:13.111
We will all speak life
over John.

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:15.009
Do I make myself clear?

01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:17.110
Mrs. Smith, we really
didn't mean to upset you.

01:06:17.112 --> 01:06:18.813
I said, do I make myself clear?

01:06:19.579 --> 01:06:20.612
Yes.

01:06:20.945 --> 01:06:21.845
Great.

01:06:35.945 --> 01:06:37.112
Are you okay?

01:06:38.778 --> 01:06:39.745
No.

01:06:40.479 --> 01:06:42.643
If I'm honest,
my sugars are sky high,

01:06:42.645 --> 01:06:44.476
and I have a pounding headache.

01:06:44.478 --> 01:06:45.843
Okay, that's not good.

01:06:45.845 --> 01:06:46.677
Yeah.

01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:49.446
I need to go home
and get my insulin and I...

01:06:50.112 --> 01:06:51.078
Go.

01:06:51.511 --> 01:06:53.977
Look, Brian and I got this.
John's in stable condition.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:56.810
Maybe you can actually
get some rest.

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:57.713
Okay.

01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:09.128
Sammy!

01:07:09.361 --> 01:07:10.861
I've missed you.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.827
Oh, you must be starved.

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.594
Let's get you something.

01:09:14.328 --> 01:09:15.526
Hey.

01:09:15.528 --> 01:09:16.627
He's stable.

01:09:16.827 --> 01:09:18.261
No real changes.

01:09:20.162 --> 01:09:21.095
Um...

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:25.294
I, um...

01:09:25.894 --> 01:09:28.627
I brought your Jordans
with me.

01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:33.095
I know no one's allowed
to touch them.

01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:35.995
But I just thought that maybe...

01:09:41.127 --> 01:09:43.194
I can't wait to see you

01:09:44.027 --> 01:09:46.394
shoot those baskets
and run up and down the court

01:09:46.827 --> 01:09:48.028
again.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:53.361
You are my pride and joy, John.

01:09:54.494 --> 01:09:56.227
Do you hear your mother?

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:01.162
And I love you to the moon.

01:10:01.494 --> 01:10:03.996
And don't you forget it.

01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:12.128
John?

01:10:12.627 --> 01:10:14.426
He just squeezed my hand!

01:10:14.428 --> 01:10:15.428
What?

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:16.792
Seriously?

01:10:16.794 --> 01:10:17.827
Yes, absolutely.

01:10:18.061 --> 01:10:20.595
John, can you do it again?
Can you squeeze my hand?

01:10:22.894 --> 01:10:24.492
Um, ask him something.

01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:25.727
Uh, okay. Um...

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.960
John, squeeze my hand if...

01:10:28.962 --> 01:10:31.292
Michael Jordan is
the best player of all time.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:33.227
Show Pastor Jason
a thing or two.

01:10:38.494 --> 01:10:39.594
I don't know.

01:10:39.828 --> 01:10:41.495
LeBron is pretty amazing.

01:10:42.361 --> 01:10:44.428
I don't know, I don't think
he can do it, Mom.

01:10:44.894 --> 01:10:46.395
Grab his other hand.

01:10:47.628 --> 01:10:50.426
Honey, squeeze my hand
for Jordan

01:10:50.428 --> 01:10:52.326
and Jason's for LeBron,
okay, baby?

01:10:52.328 --> 01:10:54.195
Come on, buddy,
you got this.

01:10:55.762 --> 01:10:58.228
The best player
of all time, son.

01:10:58.996 --> 01:11:00.328
Come on.

01:11:08.028 --> 01:11:09.925
- Yeah!
- I saw it!

01:11:09.927 --> 01:11:10.994
- Yeah!
- I saw it!

01:11:11.227 --> 01:11:15.628
Um, John, who was it who got
a record six NBA titles?

01:11:18.995 --> 01:11:20.860
Yeah!

01:11:20.862 --> 01:11:22.393
I feel you, John!

01:11:22.395 --> 01:11:25.059
And who was it who hopped down
to Miami for a second,

01:11:25.061 --> 01:11:26.896
crushing his fans
to get that ring?

01:11:29.095 --> 01:11:30.359
He can hear us!

01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:32.491
He squeezed my hand. Joyce!
He squeezed my hand.

01:11:32.493 --> 01:11:34.426
Oh, my God.
We have to tell the doctors.

01:11:34.428 --> 01:11:35.328
Oh, hell yeah!

01:11:35.861 --> 01:11:37.893
I'm sorry.

01:11:37.895 --> 01:11:39.029
I get pumped.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.361
I'm going!

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:49.495
It's Doctor Garrett, John.

01:11:49.794 --> 01:11:52.359
Your mom tells me
that you can hear us.

01:11:52.361 --> 01:11:53.495
Is that true?

01:11:57.294 --> 01:11:58.791
Tell the doctor, John.

01:11:58.793 --> 01:12:00.157
Greatest player of all time.

01:12:00.159 --> 01:12:01.958
Squeeze my hand for Jordan,

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.394
and the doctor's for LeBron.
Okay, baby?

01:12:05.028 --> 01:12:07.227
Doesn't have to be
a hard squeeze.

01:12:08.029 --> 01:12:10.062
Just let us know
you're there, John.

01:12:13.061 --> 01:12:15.462
Who won those
six NBA titles, buddy?

01:12:18.394 --> 01:12:19.728
My hand for Jordan.

01:12:20.062 --> 01:12:23.261
The doctor's hand for LeBron.
Okay, baby? You got this.

01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:31.595
I just squeezed your hand, John.

01:12:32.961 --> 01:12:35.295
You wanna just squeeze mine
right back?

01:13:14.344 --> 01:13:17.842
Phantom or, uh,
random muscle tics are normal.

01:13:17.844 --> 01:13:19.678
It wasn't random.

01:13:20.777 --> 01:13:22.711
No, he was answering us.

01:13:23.444 --> 01:13:25.611
I know it can seem like that.

01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:50.344
Hey, girls.

01:13:52.211 --> 01:13:54.212
- Hi, Mrs. J.
- Thanks for coming.

01:13:55.244 --> 01:13:56.879
- Hi.
- Hi. Thanks for coming.

01:14:01.277 --> 01:14:02.677
Rieger, Josh,

01:14:03.344 --> 01:14:05.577
get your butts over here
and give me a hug.

01:14:10.144 --> 01:14:12.711
Listen, I'm so glad
you boys are okay.

01:14:16.444 --> 01:14:18.177
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Smith.

01:14:18.179 --> 01:14:20.509
It's our fault
that John is in here.

01:14:20.511 --> 01:14:21.244
No.

01:14:21.711 --> 01:14:23.976
So what matters now is that
you're here to support John.

01:14:23.978 --> 01:14:26.676
It means the world
to his dad and me.

01:14:26.678 --> 01:14:28.410
So thank you.

01:14:28.811 --> 01:14:30.712
We brought cards that, um...

01:14:31.644 --> 01:14:32.943
people made for John.

01:14:32.945 --> 01:14:34.311
Wow. This is...

01:14:35.545 --> 01:14:37.344
It's really wonderful.
Thank you.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.942
Could you hold these a sec?

01:14:43.944 --> 01:14:45.311
Excuse me, boys.

01:14:45.644 --> 01:14:46.544
Thank you.

01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:52.741
There's no words.

01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:53.609
Listen.

01:14:53.611 --> 01:14:55.678
- I'm so sorry.
- Not another word.

01:14:55.878 --> 01:14:58.179
Cindy, it's not your fault.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:14:59.475
Sorry.

01:14:59.477 --> 01:15:00.576
Why'd we go out there?

01:15:00.578 --> 01:15:01.875
I'm sorry.

01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:03.244
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

01:15:03.477 --> 01:15:06.511
What I wouldn't give to bench
that boy right now.

01:15:07.445 --> 01:15:09.979
Did you see the Facebook page
that we made for John?

01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:11.711
- No.
- It's gone viral.

01:15:12.445 --> 01:15:13.578
Wow!

01:15:14.211 --> 01:15:15.444
Oh, girls...

01:15:16.711 --> 01:15:17.945
This is so...

01:15:18.178 --> 01:15:20.612
Oh, this is so wonderful! Wow!
Look at...

01:15:21.744 --> 01:15:22.643
these prayers and,

01:15:22.645 --> 01:15:24.009
I already did
my homework!

01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:25.307
We came
to be supportive, honey,

01:15:25.309 --> 01:15:26.708
and there's nothing left
for us to do here.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.375
So we need to not overstay
our welcome.

01:15:28.377 --> 01:15:30.676
- I wanna stay longer!
- We need to go. Okay?

01:15:30.678 --> 01:15:32.975
Girls, look, we need
to be prepared for the fact,

01:15:32.977 --> 01:15:35.878
that John is probably
not going to make it. Okay?

01:15:36.278 --> 01:15:38.208
I really don't think
you wanna be here for that.

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:40.242
- Mom!
- I know I don't.

01:15:42.309 --> 01:15:44.175
Mrs. J, are you okay?

01:15:44.177 --> 01:15:45.309
Yeah.

01:15:51.376 --> 01:15:53.444
Can I have your attention?

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:01.044
Just down that hall,

01:16:01.244 --> 01:16:03.578
do you know that John
is fighting for his life?

01:16:04.011 --> 01:16:05.208
Okay?

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:06.475
And so in this room,

01:16:06.477 --> 01:16:09.277
there is no negative talk
of any kind!

01:16:10.643 --> 01:16:11.712
Nothing!

01:16:12.377 --> 01:16:13.410
Okay?

01:16:14.644 --> 01:16:15.645
Thank you.

01:16:16.044 --> 01:16:17.612
Unreal.

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:19.908
- You okay?
- Far from it!

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:21.042
The nerve of these people!

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:22.411
Let's talk.

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:28.676
What's up?

01:16:28.678 --> 01:16:30.812
I'm worried about you.
I know you're angry.

01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:33.012
Yeah. Yeah, you're right, I am.

01:16:33.645 --> 01:16:35.944
The people in that room
are not your enemy,

01:16:36.344 --> 01:16:38.376
even if they don't say
exactly the right thing.

01:16:38.378 --> 01:16:40.811
Look, I support
what you said out there.

01:16:41.576 --> 01:16:45.376
But the way you've spoken
to some of the staff, I just...

01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:47.310
What, Brian? Say it.

01:16:47.544 --> 01:16:49.812
I need you to show them some...

01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:51.677
kindness

01:16:52.078 --> 01:16:53.175
or decency.

01:16:53.177 --> 01:16:54.909
I'm fighting for my son's life!

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:56.278
We all are!

01:17:01.343 --> 01:17:04.809
Everybody is doing their best
in an impossible situation.

01:17:04.811 --> 01:17:08.211
If it wasn't for me, our son
wouldn't be alive right now!

01:17:12.945 --> 01:17:14.477
Wow, Joyce.

01:17:18.811 --> 01:17:20.545
You're my wife. I love you.

01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:22.341
But whatever happens,

01:17:22.343 --> 01:17:24.811
I don't want you
to regret how you acted here.

01:17:26.378 --> 01:17:28.544
In my heart of hearts,

01:17:31.477 --> 01:17:33.811
I know that you don't want
that either.

01:17:34.411 --> 01:17:37.544
Grinding people into the ground
isn't gonna save our son.

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:41.377
I am begging you
to remember who you are.

01:17:41.845 --> 01:17:43.144
If not for me,

01:17:44.445 --> 01:17:45.645
for John.

01:18:09.912 --> 01:18:10.912
Hey.

01:18:12.811 --> 01:18:13.878
Wake up.

01:18:14.477 --> 01:18:15.975
Honey, it's time to wake up.

01:18:15.977 --> 01:18:17.243
Joyce, wake up!

01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:19.342
My wife is diabetic.
I can't wake her!

01:18:19.344 --> 01:18:21.411
Okay. Call for a crash cart,
let's go!

01:18:22.277 --> 01:18:24.144
Somebody give me a hand!

01:18:33.745 --> 01:18:34.576
I'm fine now.

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:37.811
I think I just took too much
of my insulin last night.

01:18:38.076 --> 01:18:40.543
You slipped
into a diabetic coma.

01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:42.876
Her blood sugar
is up to 70, Doctor.

01:18:42.878 --> 01:18:44.142
Thank you, Nurse.

01:18:44.144 --> 01:18:46.109
See? I'm fine.

01:18:46.111 --> 01:18:47.341
Joyce, you coded!

01:18:47.343 --> 01:18:48.474
I need to see John.

01:18:48.476 --> 01:18:50.476
You need to rest
for at least eight hours.

01:18:50.478 --> 01:18:51.943
I want to be with my son.

01:18:51.945 --> 01:18:53.209
I'm not asking, Joyce.

01:18:53.211 --> 01:18:54.877
You have Type 1 diabetes.

01:18:55.143 --> 01:18:57.310
You're dehydrated,
emotionally fried,

01:18:57.511 --> 01:18:59.275
and you haven't slept for days.

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:01.175
I need you here
for the long haul for John.

01:19:01.177 --> 01:19:03.176
Three hours, not eight.
Best and final.

01:19:03.845 --> 01:19:07.508
Joyce, I catch you in that room
in less than five hours,

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:09.242
I'll have you
involuntarily committed

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:10.542
and taken across the street.

01:19:10.544 --> 01:19:12.877
- You wouldn't.
- He would, with my blessing!

01:19:13.111 --> 01:19:14.311
Five hours, Joyce.

01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:15.577
Make 'em count.

01:19:35.478 --> 01:19:37.612
It's really not a good time
right now.

01:19:38.377 --> 01:19:39.777
Yeah, I know, Joyce.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:44.378
That's why I'm here.

01:19:46.976 --> 01:19:48.577
What you must think of me.

01:19:50.043 --> 01:19:51.644
You know what?

01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:55.811
I think you are
the fiercest mama bear

01:19:56.977 --> 01:19:58.378
that I've ever known.

01:19:58.644 --> 01:19:59.742
How is John?

01:19:59.744 --> 01:20:00.811
He's stable.

01:20:12.677 --> 01:20:14.878
So when I was 18,

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:19.678
I gave my first son up
for adoption.

01:20:21.578 --> 01:20:22.778
I wasn't ready,

01:20:24.277 --> 01:20:26.211
and my life was such a mess.

01:20:28.111 --> 01:20:29.611
I've never forgiven myself.

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:30.977
I can't let it go.

01:20:31.211 --> 01:20:33.545
I can't go back.
I can't fix it.

01:20:35.043 --> 01:20:39.844
So I tell John how
to spend his allowance.

01:20:40.177 --> 01:20:42.708
Brian what tie he should wear.

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:46.543
I insisted on naming our dog
"Sammy" for crying out loud.

01:20:46.545 --> 01:20:48.678
John and Brian wanted "Yoda."

01:20:49.043 --> 01:20:50.711
It's a pretty stupid name.

01:20:51.678 --> 01:20:52.609
Thank you.

01:20:52.611 --> 01:20:55.007
Oh, and you,
I still wanna fix your hair.

01:20:58.043 --> 01:20:59.476
My whole life,
I have not stopped

01:20:59.478 --> 01:21:01.344
trying to control the outcome.

01:21:06.477 --> 01:21:08.745
I can't control this, can I?

01:21:18.544 --> 01:21:20.777
Joyce, why don't you let God
handle it?

01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:31.410
Well, looks like you're
allowed back upstairs again.

01:21:32.678 --> 01:21:33.745
Yeah.

01:21:34.077 --> 01:21:37.445
Um, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna...

01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:40.512
get a breath
of fresh air outside.

01:21:40.745 --> 01:21:42.010
Okay, I'll tell everyone.

01:21:42.211 --> 01:21:43.411
Okay.

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:57.441
And I know
that You love John,

01:21:57.443 --> 01:21:59.611
just as much as I do.

01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:02.444
Maybe more.

01:22:19.876 --> 01:22:21.376
I'm sorry.

01:22:21.378 --> 01:22:22.878
I am a...

01:22:23.877 --> 01:22:26.344
I am a broken,

01:22:27.477 --> 01:22:28.711
desperate,

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:32.242
woman full of pride.

01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:39.145
But I get it.

01:22:41.444 --> 01:22:43.777
I have to let him go.

01:22:51.876 --> 01:22:53.477
I know You love me.

01:22:56.244 --> 01:22:59.441
Whatever You have,

01:22:59.443 --> 01:23:04.644
for John, for Brian, for me,

01:23:08.377 --> 01:23:11.444
I surrender. I surrender.

01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:44.943
Brian, is everything okay?

01:23:45.277 --> 01:23:46.743
I don't think so.

01:23:57.377 --> 01:23:59.543
John's fever just hit 104.

01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:02.578
Now, John's had
two full days of propofol.

01:24:03.044 --> 01:24:06.810
And it's only meant to be
taken at most for 24 hours.

01:24:07.076 --> 01:24:08.575
I think that's why
his fever's spiking.

01:24:08.577 --> 01:24:10.174
You said the propofol
was needed

01:24:10.176 --> 01:24:11.775
to keep John
in an induced coma.

01:24:11.777 --> 01:24:12.578
That's right.

01:24:12.944 --> 01:24:16.310
We had no other choice but
to keep him deeply sedated.

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:19.311
My concern now,
with this raging fever,

01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:21.742
is that the propofol

01:24:21.744 --> 01:24:23.976
and the heavy-duty antibiotics
we're giving him,

01:24:24.344 --> 01:24:27.345
will cause permanent
organ damage.

01:24:28.344 --> 01:24:30.178
Then wake him up.

01:24:33.545 --> 01:24:34.774
Excuse me?

01:24:34.776 --> 01:24:35.910
Wake John up.

01:24:36.911 --> 01:24:38.310
Take him off of everything

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:41.676
and let our son
fight for his life.

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:44.974
You just said
these things that he's on

01:24:44.976 --> 01:24:46.843
are making him worse.

01:24:47.111 --> 01:24:48.843
And even if John wakes up,

01:24:49.277 --> 01:24:51.874
we know he'll probably
never live a normal life.

01:24:51.876 --> 01:24:53.108
That's right.

01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:54.278
Okay.

01:24:55.977 --> 01:24:57.611
So we wake him up.

01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:00.744
Okay.

01:25:03.077 --> 01:25:05.744
Let's start tapering him off
all medication.

01:25:08.545 --> 01:25:10.611
Tomorrow morning,
we wake him up.

01:25:20.143 --> 01:25:22.077
I think we need to ask for help.

01:25:22.577 --> 01:25:24.644
All the help that we can get.

01:25:25.676 --> 01:25:28.141
<i>We're hearing tonight
that another miracle</i>

01:25:28.143 --> 01:25:29.442
<i>is needed for John.</i>

01:25:29.444 --> 01:25:31.241
<i>He is still in a coma,</i>

01:25:31.243 --> 01:25:33.343
<i>and he is still fighting
for his life.</i>

01:25:33.842 --> 01:25:35.674
<i>Joyce Smith, John's mother,</i>

01:25:35.676 --> 01:25:38.009
was unable to leave
her son's side.

01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:41.040
<i>But the family's pastor,
Jason Noble,</i>

01:25:41.042 --> 01:25:42.341
<i>is joining me here tonight,</i>

01:25:42.343 --> 01:25:43.974
<i>with something he'd like to say</i>

01:25:43.976 --> 01:25:45.511
<i>on the family's behalf.</i>

01:25:46.143 --> 01:25:47.176
<i>Jason.</i>

01:25:47.378 --> 01:25:49.675
<i>We've reached
a critical juncture</i>

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:51.011
<i>in John's care.</i>

01:25:51.544 --> 01:25:54.876
<i>So the Smith family
simply asks for one thing.</i>

01:25:55.177 --> 01:25:57.710
<i>So please pray for John.</i>

01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:01.410
<i>His mother, Joyce, believes
that God can do the impossible.</i>

01:26:01.777 --> 01:26:06.511
<i>So we're asking Him
to do just that.</i>

01:26:07.077 --> 01:26:08.376
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:26:08.378 --> 01:26:10.142
<i>So the Smith family
is in need</i>

01:26:10.144 --> 01:26:11.909
<i>of your prayers tonight,</i>

01:26:11.911 --> 01:26:15.775
<i>as they face this
incredibly difficult ordeal.</i>

01:26:15.777 --> 01:26:18.007
<i>When we first reported
on John's story,</i>

01:26:18.009 --> 01:26:19.674
<i>we got such an outpouring</i>

01:26:19.676 --> 01:26:22.441
<i>of care and concern
from the community.</i>

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:25.608
<i>His story continues
to touch so many lives.</i>

01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:27.741
<i>And we are committed
to keeping you posted</i>

01:26:27.743 --> 01:26:29.110
<i>every step of the way.</i>

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:33.344
<i>Our thoughts and prayers
are with you, John.</i>

01:26:34.376 --> 01:26:37.741
<i>This is Kay Quinn reporting from
Cardinal Glennon Hospital.</i>

01:26:37.743 --> 01:26:39.245
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

01:26:58.776 --> 01:27:02.311
Lord, fill John's lungs tomorrow

01:27:02.677 --> 01:27:04.345
with the breath of life.

01:27:06.344 --> 01:27:10.008

Tommy?

01:31:34.076 --> 01:31:36.576
I just wanna thank you
for saving my son.

01:31:41.309 --> 01:31:43.377
I was just doing my job.

01:31:49.177 --> 01:31:51.178
I hope he's gonna be okay.

01:32:13.977 --> 01:32:15.474
I'm gonna give you guys
some privacy.

01:32:15.476 --> 01:32:16.775
This feels like a family thing.

01:32:16.777 --> 01:32:18.876
So I'm gonna be right down
the hall if you need me.

01:32:19.308 --> 01:32:20.776
It is a family thing.

01:32:22.744 --> 01:32:24.610
So I think you should stay.

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:29.642
Yeah.

01:32:29.644 --> 01:32:31.244
Okay.

01:32:34.043 --> 01:32:35.477
Is everybody ready?

01:32:36.943 --> 01:32:38.043
Okay.

01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:40.611
Let's start with
the breathing treatment.

01:32:42.743 --> 01:32:45.742
This is going to
help open his airways and lungs.

01:32:45.744 --> 01:32:48.243
And then we can remove
the breathing tube.

01:32:48.477 --> 01:32:50.276
We're gonna extubate John.

01:32:50.543 --> 01:32:52.508
John's lungs
have partially collapsed,

01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:54.440
so this next part
won't be easy.

01:32:54.442 --> 01:32:55.974
Move back a little bit, okay?

01:32:55.976 --> 01:32:57.176
Okay.

01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:22.009
Orderly.

01:33:24.343 --> 01:33:26.774
- Is he okay? What is happening?
- Joyce!

01:33:26.776 --> 01:33:28.542
Let him hear
your voices.

01:33:28.544 --> 01:33:30.306
John, it's Mom and Dad.
We're here for you, son.

01:33:30.308 --> 01:33:32.974
- Everything's okay. We're right here.
- John, we're right here.

01:33:32.976 --> 01:33:34.675
I love you. John?

01:33:34.677 --> 01:33:35.709
Oxygen.

01:33:36.176 --> 01:33:38.141
Starting the flow, Doctor.

01:33:45.710 --> 01:33:48.408
Hmm. Okay, all right.

01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:50.074
All right, he's breathing
on his own.

01:33:50.076 --> 01:33:52.042
Okay, let's get him the Narcan.

01:33:52.044 --> 01:33:53.941
0.4 milligrams, please.

01:33:58.842 --> 01:34:01.274
This should kick-start
John into consciousness

01:34:01.276 --> 01:34:02.573
within the next few minutes,

01:34:02.575 --> 01:34:04.410
and then we'll see
what we're dealing with.

01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:06.243
Hey, hey.

01:34:06.643 --> 01:34:09.475
This went about as well
as humanly possible.

01:34:09.809 --> 01:34:11.543
That was awful.

01:34:12.644 --> 01:34:15.643
- This is the process, Joyce.
- Okay.

01:34:17.176 --> 01:34:18.576
Now, we wait.

01:34:32.776 --> 01:34:34.143
John.

01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:38.144
John, baby.

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.344
I need you to fight.

01:34:45.876 --> 01:34:47.610
John.

01:35:12.776 --> 01:35:15.676
<i>You need to come back
to us now, John.</i>

01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:19.577
<i>I need you to fight.</i>

01:35:25.410 --> 01:35:27.744
<i>You can do it, John.</i>

01:35:32.377 --> 01:35:35.811
<i>You need to come back
to us now, John.</i>

01:35:38.710 --> 01:35:42.577
<i>You have a purpose
and you are loved.</i>

01:35:52.276 --> 01:35:54.644
<i>I need you to fight.</i>

01:36:02.008 --> 01:36:03.308
John?

01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:04.674
John?

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:05.542
Oh, John!

01:36:05.544 --> 01:36:07.075
You're okay, John.

01:36:08.176 --> 01:36:10.310
- Hey, John.
- We're right here.

01:36:10.776 --> 01:36:11.973
Everything's okay.

01:36:11.975 --> 01:36:13.209
Hey, John.

01:36:13.609 --> 01:36:15.574
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

01:36:15.576 --> 01:36:17.741
- You're okay, John.
- It's Mom and Dad.

01:36:17.743 --> 01:36:19.106
And everyone's here.

01:36:19.108 --> 01:36:21.409
Everyone's here.
You had an accident.

01:36:23.143 --> 01:36:24.711
Do you know who I am?

01:36:27.042 --> 01:36:28.544
I love you.

01:36:32.744 --> 01:36:33.909
Ma.

01:36:36.210 --> 01:36:37.774
John.

01:36:37.776 --> 01:36:39.140
I'm here.

01:36:41.043 --> 01:36:42.209
I'm right here.

01:36:43.776 --> 01:36:45.443
I'm here, baby. I'm here.

01:36:46.343 --> 01:36:49.408
And in 1885, Douglass wrote

01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:52.274
<i>Narrative of the Life
of Frederick Douglass.</i>

01:36:52.276 --> 01:36:54.507
And it became
the preeminent example

01:36:54.509 --> 01:36:56.207
of the literary genre known...

01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:57.275
John is awake!

01:36:57.277 --> 01:36:59.041
His mom says he's talking.

01:36:59.043 --> 01:37:00.776
Guys, his mom says he's talking!

01:37:02.176 --> 01:37:03.776
Oh, my gosh!

01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:05.308
John's awake!

01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:07.741
John is awake! John is awake!
John is awake!

01:37:10.543 --> 01:37:11.810
Oh, my God!

01:37:14.909 --> 01:37:16.173
John is awake!

01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:19.575
John Smith is awake!

01:37:19.577 --> 01:37:22.811
<i>I repeat, John Smith is awake!</i>

01:37:25.777 --> 01:37:26.940
Breathe.

01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:31.675
Again.

01:37:37.876 --> 01:37:39.175
One more time.

01:37:45.377 --> 01:37:47.243
Your lungs are very clear.

01:37:48.843 --> 01:37:50.474
Your oxygen levels are up.

01:37:50.476 --> 01:37:52.507
- Doctor Garrett?
- Yes?

01:37:52.509 --> 01:37:55.041
John's lung cultures came back
negative for bacteria.

01:37:55.309 --> 01:37:57.041
Run them again, please.

01:37:57.043 --> 01:37:58.677
Uh, I already did.

01:38:01.777 --> 01:38:03.840
Is that a good thing?

01:38:03.842 --> 01:38:05.940
That's a really good thing,
honey.

01:38:05.942 --> 01:38:08.040
Wendy, would you
help young John

01:38:08.042 --> 01:38:09.374
with his breathing exercises?

01:38:09.376 --> 01:38:10.843
Absolutely.

01:38:12.142 --> 01:38:13.609
When Wendy's ready,

01:38:13.876 --> 01:38:15.240
I want you to breathe in deeply,

01:38:15.242 --> 01:38:17.274
so we can test
your lung capacity.

01:38:17.276 --> 01:38:18.743
Whatever you need.

01:38:19.542 --> 01:38:21.677
"Whatever I need."

01:38:22.777 --> 01:38:23.809
Joyce.

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:35.474
Forty-eight hours ago,

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:38.610
John's lungs were filled
with his own blood.

01:38:40.042 --> 01:38:43.276
He needed constant adrenaline
just to keep his heart pumping.

01:38:44.243 --> 01:38:46.240
His white blood cells
were being consumed

01:38:46.242 --> 01:38:48.577
faster than any patient
I've ever seen.

01:38:49.443 --> 01:38:53.841
His brain was experiencing
neurological devastation,

01:38:53.843 --> 01:38:57.511
while simultaneously every one
of his major organs...

01:38:59.542 --> 01:39:00.642
was failing.

01:39:00.942 --> 01:39:02.243
Now, look at him.

01:39:05.744 --> 01:39:06.744
I'm a doctor.

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:09.611
I'm supposed to know better.

01:39:11.143 --> 01:39:14.377
But there's simply
no other explanation, Joyce.

01:39:19.743 --> 01:39:21.410
Your son's a miracle.

01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:25.409
Thank you.

01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:34.141
Surprise!

01:39:35.376 --> 01:39:37.041
Thank you.

01:39:41.043 --> 01:39:42.743
Thank you.

01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:45.210
Oh, my goodness.

01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:48.809
What's that?

01:39:50.809 --> 01:39:52.243
Oh, my God!

01:39:52.443 --> 01:39:53.477
So cool!

01:39:53.808 --> 01:39:55.474
Oh, I can't grip it yet.

01:40:02.009 --> 01:40:03.143
Hey, Abby.

01:40:04.676 --> 01:40:05.909
Hey, John.

01:40:18.475 --> 01:40:21.373
Shut it, Chayla. Come on.

01:40:21.375 --> 01:40:23.309
Two, one.

01:41:04.611 --> 01:41:05.939
Hey, John!

01:41:07.841 --> 01:41:09.376
Welcome back, man!

01:41:10.642 --> 01:41:11.673
Whoo! John!

01:41:14.343 --> 01:41:15.674
Welcome back, John.

01:41:15.676 --> 01:41:16.807
Thank you, Mrs. Abbott.

01:41:16.809 --> 01:41:18.007
Thank you.

01:41:22.875 --> 01:41:26.840
Okay, everyone,
let's turn to Chapter 19

01:41:26.842 --> 01:41:28.273
in our history books.

01:41:31.843 --> 01:41:33.541
- Mrs. Abbott?
- Yeah.

01:41:33.543 --> 01:41:35.173
I know I have a lot
to catch up on.

01:41:35.175 --> 01:41:37.775
Oh, no, John.
Please, don't worry about it.

01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:40.607
I'm just glad
to have you back.

01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:41.676
Thank you.

01:41:43.176 --> 01:41:44.307
Hey, John.

01:41:44.309 --> 01:41:46.609
Uh, I was wondering,

01:41:49.177 --> 01:41:50.743
Why do you think...

01:41:51.575 --> 01:41:54.909
God chooses to save some
and not others?

01:41:58.776 --> 01:41:59.910
It's just...

01:42:01.076 --> 01:42:03.277
I lost my husband two years ago.

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:05.977
He had an aneurysm...

01:42:08.176 --> 01:42:09.877
and died in his sleep.

01:42:11.175 --> 01:42:13.576
And I'm still trying
to figure it all out.

01:42:17.575 --> 01:42:18.809
I'm so sorry.

01:42:22.676 --> 01:42:23.843
No, I'm sorry.

01:42:25.244 --> 01:42:26.842
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:42:27.075 --> 01:42:29.376
Clearly, I wasn't thinking.

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:32.807
Why don't you go and catch up
with the rest of your friends?

01:42:32.809 --> 01:42:34.277
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

01:43:28.876 --> 01:43:30.176
What's up, Miracle Boy?

01:43:30.476 --> 01:43:32.076
Where you running off to?

01:43:32.842 --> 01:43:36.542
Not gonna go try and, uh, walk
on water again, are you, John?

01:44:41.142 --> 01:44:42.409
Tommy?

01:44:45.043 --> 01:44:46.410
Tommy Shine?

01:44:47.541 --> 01:44:48.674
John?

01:44:50.809 --> 01:44:52.173
It's good to finally meet you.

01:44:52.175 --> 01:44:53.377
Yeah.

01:44:53.775 --> 01:44:54.809
You too.

01:45:05.476 --> 01:45:07.810
I was just sitting here
debating on whether...

01:45:08.342 --> 01:45:10.442
coincidences happen in life.

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:17.910
Thank you for saving me.

01:45:21.176 --> 01:45:22.709
I didn't save you, John.

01:45:23.308 --> 01:45:27.309
I mean, I did, but I didn't.

01:45:28.276 --> 01:45:30.144
In the water that day,

01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:32.976
I was ready to give up
on you, man.

01:45:33.743 --> 01:45:38.310
But then I hear this voice
telling me "Go back."

01:45:39.509 --> 01:45:42.277
God told me where to find you.

01:45:46.043 --> 01:45:48.877
Well, if there's a God...

01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:52.708
I don't know what
he's got planned for you,

01:45:52.710 --> 01:45:55.442
but it must be something
pretty special.

01:46:02.675 --> 01:46:04.743
Maybe that's true
for the both of us.

01:46:10.142 --> 01:46:11.240
Way over there?

01:46:11.242 --> 01:46:12.709
- Yeah, right there.
- Oh.

01:46:15.042 --> 01:46:16.240
<i>Good morning!</i>

01:46:16.242 --> 01:46:17.341
<i>Good morning!</i>

01:46:17.642 --> 01:46:20.476
We have a little bit of a
surprise for you this Sunday.

01:46:21.575 --> 01:46:23.807
I'd like to ask
a good friend of mine,

01:46:23.809 --> 01:46:28.440
Joyce Smith, and her family,
to join me up here.

01:46:38.876 --> 01:46:40.674
We love you, John!

01:46:48.975 --> 01:46:52.809
In all my years in ministry,

01:46:53.642 --> 01:46:56.807
I mean, I've never
even seen anything

01:46:56.809 --> 01:46:59.109
or heard of anything like this.

01:47:00.975 --> 01:47:05.876
So, John, what do you remember?

01:47:08.076 --> 01:47:10.174
This thing on?

01:47:12.142 --> 01:47:13.110
Um...

01:47:14.775 --> 01:47:16.809
Well, I do remember waking up.

01:47:19.676 --> 01:47:21.377
And the first thing I saw...

01:47:23.174 --> 01:47:27.409
was my mom, holding my hand.

01:47:31.808 --> 01:47:33.943
And letting me know that
everything was gonna be okay.

01:47:36.075 --> 01:47:40.009
When I was a baby,
and no one wanted me,

01:47:41.142 --> 01:47:42.609
my parents wanted me.

01:47:43.175 --> 01:47:45.408
And when no one thought
that I could make it back,

01:47:45.775 --> 01:47:47.677
my mom knew that I could.

01:47:50.442 --> 01:47:51.676
Mom...

01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:55.243
I love you.

01:47:56.342 --> 01:47:57.742
I love you.

01:47:58.610 --> 01:47:59.909
Dad...

01:48:01.242 --> 01:48:02.875
I love you, too.

01:48:03.508 --> 01:48:04.975
I love you, John.

01:48:11.143 --> 01:48:16.110
And for those of you
who ask why me...

01:48:19.742 --> 01:48:21.141
I don't know.

01:48:21.874 --> 01:48:24.009
But a great teacher
once told me,

01:48:24.442 --> 01:48:26.376
"Yesterday's not ours
to recover,

01:48:27.942 --> 01:48:31.142
"but tomorrow is ours
to win or lose."

01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:39.109
Lastly, I just wanna
thank the Lord.

01:48:42.276 --> 01:48:44.976
I thought it might be
a good idea for John

01:48:45.376 --> 01:48:49.309
to meet some of the people
responsible for saving his life.

01:48:49.974 --> 01:48:52.474
If you're part of the
Wentzville Fire Department,

01:48:52.476 --> 01:48:53.909
would you please stand?

01:48:57.807 --> 01:48:59.841
If you're
an emergency dispatch officer

01:48:59.843 --> 01:49:01.506
or an EMT member,

01:49:01.508 --> 01:49:03.009
could you please stand
as well?

01:49:04.209 --> 01:49:07.506
Now, if you're a member of the
Lake Saint Louis Police Department,

01:49:07.508 --> 01:49:09.043
could you please stand?

01:49:09.942 --> 01:49:12.141
If you're part of
the St. Joseph medical team,

01:49:12.143 --> 01:49:13.207
could you stand?

01:49:16.008 --> 01:49:18.373
And if you're part of the
Cardinal Glennon medical team,

01:49:18.375 --> 01:49:19.708
could you stand?

01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:28.608
Thank you so much
for your tireless service.

01:49:28.610 --> 01:49:30.007
For your sacrifice.

01:49:30.009 --> 01:49:31.606
If you could remain standing,

01:49:31.608 --> 01:49:32.872
I'd like to ask anyone

01:49:32.874 --> 01:49:35.109
who prayed for John
at school to stand.

01:49:37.941 --> 01:49:40.909
I'd like anyone who prayed
for him at home to stand.

01:49:45.942 --> 01:49:47.874
I'd like anyone
who prayed for him

01:49:47.876 --> 01:49:50.143
in this very church to stand.

01:50:02.642 --> 01:50:04.976
Thank you.
You can please be seated.

01:50:09.707 --> 01:50:14.375
I think it's been said
that love...

01:50:14.675 --> 01:50:20.776
is the most powerful force
on this earth.

01:50:22.275 --> 01:50:26.275
And my husband and I,
we believe that...

01:50:27.608 --> 01:50:29.707
without love,
we cannot flourish,

01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:31.176
we cannot grow.

01:50:32.009 --> 01:50:35.708
We cannot find our place
in this world.

01:50:36.309 --> 01:50:40.775
And the power of love,
and God's love especially,

01:50:41.442 --> 01:50:43.041
is truly the one and only thing

01:50:43.043 --> 01:50:45.908
that makes all things possible.

01:50:47.442 --> 01:50:49.242
Thank you for loving John,

01:50:49.975 --> 01:50:52.043
and thank you for loving us.

01:50:52.543 --> 01:50:54.209
Thank you so much.

01:50:55.275 --> 01:50:56.541
Thank you.

01:51:04.108 --> 01:51:05.775
Whoo!

01:51:15.809 --> 01:51:18.076
John! Eagle, eagle!

01:51:18.375 --> 01:51:19.842
Eagle, eagle!
