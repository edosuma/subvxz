[pensive music playing]

00:09.759 --> 00:11.136
-[Skip] Okay?
-Mm.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.763
Haven't slept all night.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.267
-Did you connect with Esi?
-I did. Good news and bad news.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.936
Good news, Esi made contact
with The Fribourg Confidence

00:20.020 --> 00:22.480
to extract the drive from
Reddington's safe deposit box

00:22.564 --> 00:23.398
at Key Atlantic.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.192
Once they get the drive,
have Esi deliver it to Cooper.

00:26.276 --> 00:30.905
If the intel on that drive can prove
Reddington is N-13, Cooper should know.

00:30.989 --> 00:31.823
The bad news?

00:31.906 --> 00:34.075
72 hours ago, you were an FBI agent.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.537
Now you're on the run
from the people you used to work for

00:37.620 --> 00:40.707
-What exactly is our plan?
-We see Mr. French.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.418
I don't know who that is.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.172
My mother spent almost 30 years
running from Neville Townsend.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.759
The only way she survived
was through a network of resources

00:50.842 --> 00:52.510
Mr. French helped her build.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.429
He was her guardian angel.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.432
I found his contact
in her personal effects.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.975
He says he can help.

00:59.976 --> 01:03.480
-We're not starting flat-footed.
-No. [laughing]

01:03.563 --> 01:07.776
We're starting with one of the men
my mother trusted the most.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.822
[automated voice on voicemail]
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:14.449
Voicemail.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.500
-Maybe he's at the airport.
-He said meet up at his apartment.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.961
Call him when we're here
and he'd come meet us.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.047
So, what do you wanna do?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.434
Something's happened. Follow me.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.900
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>Phillip went to Stockholm on business.</i>

01:48.983 --> 01:52.862
<i>Said he'd be two days.</i>
<i>Two days passed and he never returned.</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:55.156
<i>I called. No response.</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:59.828
<i>Few days later, Phillip phoned.</i>
<i>He said he was in Washington.</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:01.287
<i>He said something had happened</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:04.332
and that it wasn't safe
for me at the house.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.794
He told me there was a key
taped to the bottom of his printer.

02:07.877 --> 02:11.965
It unlocked this apartment,
which I didn't even know he had.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.093
The only thing Phillip would say
about his situation

02:15.176 --> 02:17.804
was the daughter of a client
was in trouble.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.098
I assume you're the daughter.

02:20.181 --> 02:24.227
Mrs. French, your husband,
what did he tell you he does for a living?

02:24.310 --> 02:28.606
Phillip was a recruiter
for a data management firm.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.193
But that was a lie, too, wasn't it?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.696
I'm afraid so.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.532
Do you believe he's alive?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.701
I have no idea.

02:41.035 --> 02:45.081
Reddington's behind this.
He's not satisfied killing my mother.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.917
He has to make sure
I have no access to any of her resources.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.420
Okay. Slow down. We have money.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.464
We need more than money, Skip.
We need assets.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.593
Mr. French was gonna introduce me
to the people my mother trusted.

02:56.676 --> 03:00.054
-This woman doesn't know anything.
-We know nothing about her.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.932
We know she's scared and can't go home.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.977
Which is why
we're not going to abandon her.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.230
Here is my number.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.692
If you hear from your husband,
if he reaches out,

03:12.775 --> 03:14.235
if you need anything at all.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.863
I know you have no reason to trust me,

03:16.946 --> 03:19.407
but I am on your husband's side.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.409
-Where will you go?
-I don't know,

03:21.492 --> 03:23.912
but what I do know is
I'll do everything in my power

03:23.995 --> 03:26.039
to get your husband back
and to keep you safe.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.374
Mom. I'm tired.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.168
I know, we're gonna go soon.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.502
Why don't you stay?

03:31.586 --> 03:34.505
-Oh, we...
-There's plenty of room.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.799
You and Agnes can take the room upstairs.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.803
Your friend can have the sofa.
Unless you have some place else to go.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.682
That's very kind of you.
We're gonna stay with our friend, Agnes.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.893
Can you read me a story?

03:46.976 --> 03:49.729
I can't.
We didn't bring any of your books.

03:49.812 --> 03:53.775
-What if I tell you a story?
-What kind of story?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.027
A funny one.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.447
About a girl and her friend
and the sleepover they have

03:59.530 --> 04:01.449
in a strawberry cake factory.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.535
-That sounds awesome.
-I'll get your pajamas.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.954
-[Mrs. French] Come?
-Thank you.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.000
[tender music playing]

04:16.089 --> 04:18.049
I wish you were here.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.301
[Kaplan] <i>I'm always here for you, dearie.</i>

04:20.802 --> 04:22.804
["Tili Tili Bom" playing]

04:25.682 --> 04:28.601
This is the last thing
I ever wanted for you.

04:30.186 --> 04:34.023
I could've stopped him and I didn't.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.943
-I failed you.
-You protected me.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.161
I can't do this alone.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.955
I know that.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.333
It's why you've been thinking
of asking for help.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.252
About turning to him.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.213
You're a smart woman, Elizabeth.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.801
Which is why
this next part will be so painful.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.847
But if you've learned anything
from my mistakes,

05:06.472 --> 05:09.309
it's that you can't show weakness.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.602
You have to fight like Reddington.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.230
Be every bit as fierce

05:14.856 --> 05:17.567
and cross whatever line it takes.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.860
What are you saying?

05:19.694 --> 05:23.823
I'm saying you know what you have to do.
Listen to your heart.

05:25.825 --> 05:30.288
The enemy of your enemy is your friend.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.087
[dramatic music playing]

05:41.257 --> 05:42.300
[Liz] Skip.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.177
-Wake up.
-What?

05:44.260 --> 05:46.637
-I know what we gotta do.
-Yeah, sleep?

05:46.721 --> 05:51.225
We'll take down Reddington by teaming up
with the man he hates the most.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.153
[Skip] This is insane.

06:02.236 --> 06:06.365
Neville Townsend spent 30 years
trying to hunt and kill your mother,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.242
now you want him to be our partner?

06:08.326 --> 06:12.163
-We have a common enemy.
-Townsend doesn't know Reddington's N-13.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.624
He thinks your mother
is the one that betrayed him,

06:14.707 --> 06:16.375
and he thinks she's dead.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.627
Why poke the bear?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.045
If he knew the truth,

06:19.128 --> 06:22.715
if he knew Reddington killed his family
and framed my mother,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.175
he'd hate him as much as I do.

06:24.258 --> 06:27.261
Neville Townsend's the one man
other than Reddington

06:27.345 --> 06:30.139
who has the power and resources
to really see this through.

06:30.223 --> 06:35.937
Even if I agreed to this idea,
we have no idea how to find him.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.065
His wife and children are dead,
but not his sister.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.983
Her name is Mary Bremmer.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.278
She's one of the very few people
in Townsend's life

06:44.362 --> 06:46.155
that my mother was able to identify.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.118
If we could get to her,
if we could win her trust,

06:50.201 --> 06:52.286
she might put us in touch with Townsend.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.413
You really need to go back to bed.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.959
Skip, I know how to make this work.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.295
Ask me how we recruit her.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.840
I'm not gonna ask you that.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.092
[pensive music playing]

07:12.140 --> 07:13.474
How do we recruit her?

07:16.686 --> 07:19.272
With the help of criminals.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.857
["Fa-Fa-Fa" playing]

07:20.940 --> 07:23.860
And I know a lot of criminals.

07:23.943 --> 07:28.114
<i>Before we do anything,</i>
<i>we need a network in place.</i>

07:28.197 --> 07:30.074
So how long did you serve?

07:30.158 --> 07:33.119
Two tours, went private after that.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.163
[Liz] <i>We start with protection...</i>

07:35.913 --> 07:37.290
<i>people we vet.</i>

07:37.373 --> 07:40.126
And you ran reconnaissance planes?

07:40.209 --> 07:42.587
As well as security detail.
I go where I'm needed.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.797
[Liz] <i>At the same time, we need papers.</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:51.137
All of us. Identities with backgrounds,
travel histories, tax records, the works.

07:53.139 --> 07:58.102
Okay, wait, go back to Townsend.
You said we get to him through his sister.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.063
-How is that supposed to work?
-First we have to find her.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.734
There's a bounty hunter out of Bosnia,
Adin MarkoviÄ‡.

08:04.817 --> 08:09.322
<i>He's supposed to be the best of the best.</i>
<i>We find him, then he finds Bremmer.</i>

08:09.405 --> 08:13.493
He hopes you're happy with the results
and would like to discuss his payment.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.870
[Skip] <i>Bremmer's</i>
<i>a chemical weapons dealer.</i>

08:15.953 --> 08:17.288
<i>She doesn't trust anyone.</i>

08:17.371 --> 08:20.166
Why would she trust or agree to help us?

08:20.249 --> 08:24.086
She won't.
Which is why we have to earn her trust.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.380
I was thinking of saving her life.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.673
Is it in jeopardy?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.675
Not that I know of. It will be.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.803
What do you know about Alban Veseli,
The Freelancer?

08:32.887 --> 08:35.806
<i>He was the first criminal</i>
<i>our task force put away.</i>

08:35.890 --> 08:38.559
He's been rotting in a hole
for seven years.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.020
Seven years ago,
Veseli derailed a passenger train

08:41.103 --> 08:43.022
<i>by making it hit a curve too fast.</i>

08:43.105 --> 08:46.526
[Liz] <i>I thought we'd use</i>
<i>Reddington's money, hire him a new lawyer.</i>

08:46.609 --> 08:47.735
<i>Someone we own.</i>

08:47.818 --> 08:50.488
-Who the hell are you?
-I don't think you got a fair trial.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.448
[Liz] <i>The lawyer files an appeal.</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:56.118
Claims the court violated
his client's 6th Amendment right

08:56.202 --> 08:57.995
to confront his accuser,

08:58.079 --> 09:02.166
who just so happens to be
the FBI's confidential source,

09:02.250 --> 09:03.584
Raymond Reddington.

09:03.668 --> 09:07.755
The U.S. government is willingly
in business with Raymond Reddington?

09:07.838 --> 09:11.300
But the feds will never
put Reddington in a courtroom.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.595
I'm a fugitive.
I'm not gonna show up in court either.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.764
I ordered Agent Keen to appear,
she didn't.

09:16.847 --> 09:22.019
So if the case agent doesn't show
and the confidential source doesn't show,

09:22.103 --> 09:25.439
the judge would be--
To say the least, he'd be concerned.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.608
[Velchek] <i>I'm not concerned. I'm offended.</i>

09:27.692 --> 09:31.028
I am granting the defendant's motion
to withdraw his guilty plea

09:31.112 --> 09:33.781
and I am forced
to dismiss the charges against him.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.782
Don't do this.

09:34.865 --> 09:38.661
You wanna release a mass murderer
in exchange for what?

09:38.744 --> 09:41.872
Ms. Keen arranged for your release
because she requires your services.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.624
What does she need me to do?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.710
I want him to kill Mary Bremmer.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.169
So you can save her.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.674
We get The Freelancer out of jail,
in exchange, he goes after Bremmer.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.802
He won't kill Bremmer,
because we're gonna grab her.

09:54.885 --> 09:55.720
[Skip] <i>I like it.</i>

09:55.803 --> 09:59.181
Except you told me
The Freelancer hides his assassinations

09:59.265 --> 10:01.767
by masking them
as mass-casualty accidents.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.146
There are 162 passengers onboard.
He'll kill everyone.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.273
I thought The Freelancer
was after Reddington.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.734
I'll back-channel information
through the task force

10:09.817 --> 10:11.652
and make sure no one gets hurt,

10:11.736 --> 10:14.238
and The Freelancer goes back to prison
where he belongs.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.865
Go back to Bremmer.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.952
You pull her off the street,
that woman ain't gonna be happy.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.331
I want to talk to her. Do you hear me?

10:23.414 --> 10:26.751
[Liz] <i>After I explain to her</i>
<i>that I not only saved her life,</i>

10:26.834 --> 10:30.046
I plucked her out of the arms
of the awaiting FBI,

<i>she might change her tune.</i>

In fact, she may even thank me
by offering to make an introduction

10:42.600 --> 10:44.894
to her brother, Neville Townsend.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.812
Bremmer said she's thought about it.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.441
She's willing to reach out to her brother,
see if she can make an introduction.

10:55.863 --> 10:59.909
<i>Well, Miss Keen.</i>

11:00.993 --> 11:03.871
<i>This is certainly unprecedented.</i>
<i>Where's Mary?</i>

11:03.954 --> 11:05.414
In FBI custody.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.626
She took her, what, to hurt me?

11:08.709 --> 11:11.671
-Talk to me. I'm right--
-...here. I'm looking right at you.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.590
Why did you take my sister?

11:14.673 --> 11:16.717
Because I had no way to reach you.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.553
Taking your sister
forced her to make contact,

11:19.637 --> 11:21.430
to negotiate her safe return--

11:21.514 --> 11:23.891
...and to get this
face-to-face meeting with you.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.936
-I had nothing--
-...to do with today's capture.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.312
[Townsend] <i>You're an FBI agent.</i>

11:28.396 --> 11:29.397
Not anymore.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.107
[Liz] The FBI can't help me.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.733
You can.

11:35.569 --> 11:39.615
[Kaplan] <i>You're doing well, Elizabeth.</i>
<i>Stay strong. He'll say yes.</i>

11:39.698 --> 11:43.577
I don't know if I can do this.
This animal hunted my mother.

in exchange for immunity.

<i>and the flash drive you sent Cooper.</i>

25:05.086 --> 25:08.215
If Reddington's really N-13,
we have a good chance of proving it.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.801
<i>And if we can... maybe you can come home.</i>

25:11.885 --> 25:13.637
That's all I care about, Liz.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.265
I mean, no,
maybe you can't be an agent again,

25:17.349 --> 25:21.061
<i>but at least you can get your life back,</i>
<i>you and Agnes can be together.</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:24.898
We gotta talk. Figure out how to end this.
I'll be at Bentham Park at midnight.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.816
<i>Meet me there. And, Keen...</i>

25:27.692 --> 25:28.902
<i>you can trust me.</i>

25:28.985 --> 25:29.986
[beeps]

25:31.363 --> 25:32.364
[exhales]

25:33.740 --> 25:35.533
Are you coming home tonight?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.244
[Liz] <i>Not tonight, honey.</i>

25:37.327 --> 25:41.289
But my being away so much,
I think is about to end.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.000
Is Mrs. French reading
<i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> to you?

25:44.084 --> 25:47.170
We're almost done. It's really good!

25:47.254 --> 25:48.213
[cell phone buzzing]

25:49.089 --> 25:52.884
You finish up and tell me all about it
when I get home, okay?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.761
<i>-Love you.</i>
-Love you too.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.597
Don't answer that.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.266
He could have good news.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.101
You should not be talking to the FBI.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.270
-You cannot take that call.
-Keen, it's me.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.523
I don't even know
if you get these messages.

26:06.606 --> 26:10.735
-I don't know who I'm talking to.
-Ressler says the task force has a source.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.322
His name is Rakitin
and he's willing to talk.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.742
If he does,
he could expose Reddington as N-13.

26:18.868 --> 26:20.662
He could end all of this.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.581
I wish that were true.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.627
But you don't need to hear his message
to know that's not the case.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.755
Look. Rakitin's dead.
I don't know how, but...

26:31.589 --> 26:33.216
Seems like he was poisoned.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.220
I mean, I really thought
it was over this time.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.975
We miss you. We just want you back.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.059
[engine starts]

26:45.937 --> 26:49.774
[Liz] <i>I told her it was over.</i>
<i>That I'd be coming home for good.</i>

26:49.858 --> 26:51.484
You're doing the best you can.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.863
I'm responsible for Mary Bremmer's murder,
Dembe's torture,

26:54.946 --> 26:58.199
and I got nothing to show for it
except for another reminder

26:58.283 --> 27:02.537
that no matter how tight the noose,
Reddington will always cheat the hangman.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.959
I heard from the police today.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.545
They found my husband's body.

27:11.421 --> 27:16.009
They say he died of natural causes,
but you know differently.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.553
I'm so sorry.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.097
Phillip was a good man.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.683
That whatever he was doing,

27:23.767 --> 27:27.979
he was doing because he believed
it was the right thing to do.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.150
I don't need sympathy.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.735
I need justice.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.780
You're the one who can get it for me.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.074
I tried. For all of us.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.285
I don't think I can keep trying.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.453
I understand.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.581
You thought you could end this.
You couldn't.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.416
You don't know who we're dealing with.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.670
But I do know this,
good triumphs over evil.

27:54.672 --> 27:57.175
I just don't think I have what it'll take.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.845
Of course you do. Every mother does.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.472
The love for her child.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.474
-Isn't that what saved you?
-Yes.

28:04.557 --> 28:07.143
Didn't your mother
give up everything for you?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.061
Yes.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.979
You think you should pay that forward?

28:10.063 --> 28:12.315
Of course, but I don't know how.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.983
You'll figure it out.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.528
How can you be so sure?

28:16.611 --> 28:18.988
Because love wins.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.532
You really believe that?

28:20.615 --> 28:26.788
I do. And seeing how you are with Agnes,
I believe you do too.

28:28.123 --> 28:28.998
[knocking on door]

28:33.086 --> 28:34.170
Elizabeth.

28:34.838 --> 28:35.922
Isabella, hi.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.173
Is my father okay?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.216
Dembe's fine.

28:38.800 --> 28:43.221
But I did come because
I think he could use your help.

28:46.266 --> 28:50.103
Thank God she was too young
to remember what happened to her.

28:50.186 --> 28:53.106
-I dread the day when I have to tell her.
<i>-Do you have to?</i>

28:53.189 --> 28:54.649
[Isabella] <i>I believe in the truth.</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:56.776
When she's ready, I'll tell her.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.112
Are you gonna tell her about your father?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.782
-He needs our help?
-He needs our protection.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.617
From Reddington.

29:05.326 --> 29:09.080
-Did he tell you that?
-No. He loves Reddington.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.917
That's based on a lie.
One that I'm not sure he knows about.

29:13.001 --> 29:17.714
Reddington isn't who he says he is.
I believe-- The bureau believes

29:17.797 --> 29:19.799
Reddington may be a Russian asset.

29:19.883 --> 29:20.884
What?

29:20.967 --> 29:23.803
We need proof.
With your help, we can get it.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.599
You're not here to help my father.
You're here to help yourself.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.267
I'm here to help us both.

29:29.350 --> 29:32.437
Most importantly,
I'm here to help our daughters.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.941
She's beautiful. She's innocent.

29:38.818 --> 29:41.529
One day when she's ready,
you're gonna tell her

29:41.613 --> 29:43.823
that when she was an infant,
she was abducted,

29:43.907 --> 29:46.743
<i>used as collateral so someone</i>
<i>could get to your father.</i>

29:46.826 --> 29:49.871
<i>You're going to tell her</i>
<i>as if it could never happen again.</i>

29:49.954 --> 29:53.875
But you and I both know,
as long as Reddington is in our lives,

29:53.958 --> 29:55.335
that isn't true.

29:56.544 --> 29:58.171
I won't hurt my father.

29:58.254 --> 30:02.133
-I would never ask you to.
-What do you want me to do?

30:02.926 --> 30:06.888
I need you to call your father.
Tell him you wanna see him.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.389
I haven't seen him in months.

30:09.057 --> 30:12.477
[Liz] <i>Better. You miss him.</i>
<i>You want him to spend time with Elle.</i>

30:14.145 --> 30:16.105
Hi. It's me.

30:16.606 --> 30:20.026
Once you've set a meeting,
I need you to plant this device.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.238
What do you want to hear him say?

30:23.321 --> 30:26.491
Nothing. I want to hear
what Reddington says to him.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.995
You really think this will help?

30:31.079 --> 30:35.708
I think with any luck, we can figure out
what Reddington is up to.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.794
[upbeat music playing]

30:45.844 --> 30:47.220
She's gotten so big.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.681
I know. Can you believe it?

30:51.307 --> 30:52.642
I'm glad you called.

30:53.226 --> 30:57.480
-We miss you, Dad.
-Do you? I wasn't sure.

30:57.564 --> 30:58.773
Of course we do.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.282
[Dembe] <i>Your heart can betray you.</i>
<i>How many times have you told me that?</i>

31:07.365 --> 31:09.492
[Raymond] <i>Anne is not betraying me.</i>

31:10.326 --> 31:13.079
We've run no names.
Done no background checks.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.331
On the good people of Cottonwood Falls?

31:15.415 --> 31:20.253
If you're lucky, you might find a late fee
for <i>Tom Sawyer</i> at the local library.

31:20.336 --> 31:23.089
-You're letting your guard down.
-That's not what I'm doing.

31:25.008 --> 31:30.054
Okay, it is what I'm doing.
But I'm having a splendid time doing it.

Hey. It's me.

I am so sorry. Are you okay?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.134
I should've seen you backing out.

32:08.217 --> 32:09.844
No. It was my fault.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.804
It's not that bad.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.307
Let me give you my insurance.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.645
[Liz sighs]

If we were in the city,

-you'd be screaming at me.
-[chuckles] You're not from here?

I rented a place on Chase Lake.

Hi, Cindi. I'm Anne.

Anne Foster. Of 429 Roslyn Place.

32:38.373 --> 32:41.918
That's it. Let me give you my cell too.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.712
If those insurance people
give you any trouble,

-I want you to give me a call, okay?
-If I'd known you'd be this nice,

32:48.007 --> 32:50.134
I would've run into you on purpose.

-You take care.
-You too, I'm sorry again.

with a nice smile or a nice ass.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.448
-But?
-I think punctuality is sexy.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.993

-Oh.

33:15.076 --> 33:18.538
Nice smile, nice ass, and on time.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.047
Of course. I'm sorry.

I brought this to thank you
for being so nice about what happened.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.094
Did you bake me a cake?

33:33.177 --> 33:36.431
-I hope you like red velvet.
-You are too thoughtful.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.142
Come in. Some friends and I
are about to play some bridge.

33:39.225 --> 33:43.688
No. I just came to drop that off.
I don't wanna intrude.

No, I'm sure we'll bump
into each other again soon.

Bye.

So much for the sexiest man alive.

I'm just saying, I like punctuality.

-Maybe his plane was delayed.
-Why hasn't he called?

34:06.669 --> 34:09.213

a dramatic entrance.

Why don't you run into town,

I just gotta check your ground wires.
It's standard.

Okay, very good.

you could have called.

I need you to come with me.

We've gotta call it off.

Reddington knows we're here.

-That changes nothing.
-We'll have other opportunities.

-Landon. She's gone.

and went to the police.

You can't attack a police station.

No space. Remember?

Between what you want
and what you're willing to do.

Innocent people will get killed.

No space. None.

I'll show you the proper way
to exact revenge.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.205
And for what? Nothing.

37:29.288 --> 37:32.250
I'm listening to the police scanner.
He's gone.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.755
-The man who came after you today...
-Neville Townsend

37:38.464 --> 37:39.715
He won't stop, will he?

37:40.675 --> 37:42.802
You're right. There is space for me.

37:43.636 --> 37:46.430
Between what I want
and what I'm willing to do.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.807
That's unacceptable.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.892
I'll keep Reddington to myself.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.019
-You said he was gone.
<i>-He is.</i>

37:52.103 --> 37:54.188
But I think I know how to find him.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.899
Townsend was there and he can't see it.

37:56.983 --> 37:59.402
The magic trick. How Raymond got away.

38:00.152 --> 38:02.905
You weren't there,
but you know how he did it.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.658
Because it's what you would've done.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.788
Is there somewhere you can go?

38:10.871 --> 38:13.666
Not to your daughter's,
they'll anticipate that.

38:13.749 --> 38:16.294
My friend Cindi,
the one who made the cake.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.628
She has a cabin.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.088
See if you can go there.

38:20.631 --> 38:21.966
Okay, sweetie.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.677
I'll call you as soon as I know more.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.638
I love you, be safe.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.194
Anne, it's me. Cindi.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.157
Oh, thank God.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.743
-I was about to call you.
-Are you okay?

38:48.826 --> 38:51.454
-The town is talking about what happened.
-It was awful.

38:52.246 --> 38:54.123
The whole thing, it was just...

38:55.833 --> 38:59.211
I have this friend.
With me he's kind and decent,

38:59.295 --> 39:02.214
but he's done terrible things
and terrible people are after him.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.884

He says the people that are after him

That's why I was gonna call you.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.578
Your cabin,
no one would look for me there.

39:32.661 --> 39:35.581
If I could stay there,
even just for a few days.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.833
I wish that were possible.

39:38.334 --> 39:43.756
I really do. And maybe it can be,
after you help me find Reddington.

39:45.341 --> 39:47.176
I need to know where he is.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.012
You're one of them.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.431
-Yes.
-No.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.686
But we want the same thing.

39:57.770 --> 40:01.315
He left. I don't know where he went.

-Why'd you come back? What do you want?

-Do you wanna tell her who you really are?
-Raymond...

40:29.760 --> 40:33.180
It's okay. Just stay calm.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.393
You and Kate underestimate me.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.353
So she's here too.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.313
Do you see her?

40:43.149 --> 40:45.651
I do. Without even having to look.

40:45.734 --> 40:50.990
His true identity is a secret, Anne.
He's never told me who he really is.

40:54.410 --> 40:57.580
Maybe he will now.
As a deathbed confession.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.042
Let her go.
She doesn't have to be here for this.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.546
Finally, we agree on something.
