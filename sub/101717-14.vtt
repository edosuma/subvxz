[pensive music playing]

00:09.759 --> 00:11.136
-[Skip] Okay?
-Mm.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.763
Haven't slept all night.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.267
-Did you connect with Esi?
-I did. Good news and bad news.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.936
Good news, Esi made contact
with The Fribourg Confidence

00:20.020 --> 00:22.480
to extract the drive from
Reddington's safe deposit box

00:22.564 --> 00:23.398
at Key Atlantic.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.192
Once they get the drive,
have Esi deliver it to Cooper.

00:26.276 --> 00:30.905
If the intel on that drive can prove
Reddington is N-13, Cooper should know.

00:30.989 --> 00:31.823
The bad news?

00:31.906 --> 00:34.075
72 hours ago, you were an FBI agent.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.537
Now you're on the run
from the people you used to work for

00:37.620 --> 00:40.707
-What exactly is our plan?
-We see Mr. French.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.418
I don't know who that is.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.172
My mother spent almost 30 years
running from Neville Townsend.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.759
The only way she survived
was through a network of resources

00:50.842 --> 00:52.510
Mr. French helped her build.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.429
He was her guardian angel.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.432
I found his contact
in her personal effects.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.975
He says he can help.

00:59.976 --> 01:03.480
-We're not starting flat-footed.
-No. [laughing]

01:03.563 --> 01:07.776
We're starting with one of the men
my mother trusted the most.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.822
[automated voice on voicemail]
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:14.449
Voicemail.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.500
-Maybe he's at the airport.
-He said meet up at his apartment.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.961
Call him when we're here
and he'd come meet us.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.047
So, what do you wanna do?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.434
Something's happened. Follow me.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.900
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>Phillip went to Stockholm on business.</i>

01:48.983 --> 01:52.862
<i>Said he'd be two days.</i>
<i>Two days passed and he never returned.</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:55.156
<i>I called. No response.</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:59.828
<i>Few days later, Phillip phoned.</i>
<i>He said he was in Washington.</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:01.287
<i>He said something had happened</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:04.332
and that it wasn't safe
for me at the house.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.794
He told me there was a key
taped to the bottom of his printer.

02:07.877 --> 02:11.965
It unlocked this apartment,
which I didn't even know he had.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.093
The only thing Phillip would say
about his situation

02:15.176 --> 02:17.804
was the daughter of a client
was in trouble.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.098
I assume you're the daughter.

02:20.181 --> 02:24.227
Mrs. French, your husband,
what did he tell you he does for a living?

02:24.310 --> 02:28.606
Phillip was a recruiter
for a data management firm.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.193
But that was a lie, too, wasn't it?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.696
I'm afraid so.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.532
Do you believe he's alive?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.701
I have no idea.

02:41.035 --> 02:45.081
Reddington's behind this.
He's not satisfied killing my mother.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.917
He has to make sure
I have no access to any of her resources.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.420
Okay. Slow down. We have money.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.464
We need more than money, Skip.
We need assets.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.593
Mr. French was gonna introduce me
to the people my mother trusted.

02:56.676 --> 03:00.054
-This woman doesn't know anything.
-We know nothing about her.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.932
We know she's scared and can't go home.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.977
Which is why
we're not going to abandon her.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.230
Here is my number.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.692
If you hear from your husband,
if he reaches out,

03:12.775 --> 03:14.235
if you need anything at all.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.863
I know you have no reason to trust me,

03:16.946 --> 03:19.407
but I am on your husband's side.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.409
-Where will you go?
-I don't know,

03:21.492 --> 03:23.912
but what I do know is
I'll do everything in my power

03:23.995 --> 03:26.039
to get your husband back
and to keep you safe.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.374
Mom. I'm tired.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.168
I know, we're gonna go soon.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.502
Why don't you stay?

03:31.586 --> 03:34.505
-Oh, we...
-There's plenty of room.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.799
You and Agnes can take the room upstairs.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.803
Your friend can have the sofa.
Unless you have some place else to go.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.682
That's very kind of you.
We're gonna stay with our friend, Agnes.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.893
Can you read me a story?

03:46.976 --> 03:49.729
I can't.
We didn't bring any of your books.

03:49.812 --> 03:53.775
-What if I tell you a story?
-What kind of story?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.027
A funny one.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.447
About a girl and her friend
and the sleepover they have

03:59.530 --> 04:01.449
in a strawberry cake factory.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.535
-That sounds awesome.
-I'll get your pajamas.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.954
-[Mrs. French] Come?
-Thank you.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.000
[tender music playing]

04:16.089 --> 04:18.049
I wish you were here.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.301
[Kaplan] <i>I'm always here for you, dearie.</i>

04:20.802 --> 04:22.804
["Tili Tili Bom" playing]

04:25.682 --> 04:28.601
This is the last thing
I ever wanted for you.

04:30.186 --> 04:34.023
I could've stopped him and I didn't.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.943
-I failed you.
-You protected me.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.161
I can't do this alone.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.955
I know that.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.333
It's why you've been thinking
of asking for help.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.252
About turning to him.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.213
You're a smart woman, Elizabeth.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.801
Which is why
this next part will be so painful.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.847
But if you've learned anything
from my mistakes,

05:06.472 --> 05:09.309
it's that you can't show weakness.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.602
You have to fight like Reddington.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.230
Be every bit as fierce

05:14.856 --> 05:17.567
and cross whatever line it takes.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.860
What are you saying?

05:19.694 --> 05:23.823
I'm saying you know what you have to do.
Listen to your heart.

05:25.825 --> 05:30.288
The enemy of your enemy is your friend.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.087
[dramatic music playing]

05:41.257 --> 05:42.300
[Liz] Skip.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.177
-Wake up.
-What?

05:44.260 --> 05:46.637
-I know what we gotta do.
-Yeah, sleep?

05:46.721 --> 05:51.225
We'll take down Reddington by teaming up
with the man he hates the most.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.153
[Skip] This is insane.

06:02.236 --> 06:06.365
Neville Townsend spent 30 years
trying to hunt and kill your mother,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.242
now you want him to be our partner?

06:08.326 --> 06:12.163
-We have a common enemy.
-Townsend doesn't know Reddington's N-13.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.624
He thinks your mother
is the one that betrayed him,

06:14.707 --> 06:16.375
and he thinks she's dead.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.627
Why poke the bear?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.045
If he knew the truth,

06:19.128 --> 06:22.715
if he knew Reddington killed his family
and framed my mother,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.175
he'd hate him as much as I do.

06:24.258 --> 06:27.261
Neville Townsend's the one man
other than Reddington

06:27.345 --> 06:30.139
who has the power and resources
to really see this through.

06:30.223 --> 06:35.937
Even if I agreed to this idea,
we have no idea how to find him.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.065
His wife and children are dead,
but not his sister.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.983
Her name is Mary Bremmer.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.278
She's one of the very few people
in Townsend's life

06:44.362 --> 06:46.155
that my mother was able to identify.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.118
If we could get to her,
if we could win her trust,

06:50.201 --> 06:52.286
she might put us in touch with Townsend.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.413
You really need to go back to bed.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.959
Skip, I know how to make this work.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.295
Ask me how we recruit her.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.840
I'm not gonna ask you that.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.092
[pensive music playing]

07:12.140 --> 07:13.474
How do we recruit her?

07:16.686 --> 07:19.272
With the help of criminals.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.857
["Fa-Fa-Fa" playing]

07:20.940 --> 07:23.860
And I know a lot of criminals.

07:23.943 --> 07:28.114
<i>Before we do anything,</i>
<i>we need a network in place.</i>

07:28.197 --> 07:30.074
So how long did you serve?

07:30.158 --> 07:33.119
Two tours, went private after that.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.163
[Liz] <i>We start with protection...</i>

07:35.913 --> 07:37.290
<i>people we vet.</i>

07:37.373 --> 07:40.126
And you ran reconnaissance planes?

07:40.209 --> 07:42.587
As well as security detail.
I go where I'm needed.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.797
[Liz] <i>At the same time, we need papers.</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:51.137
All of us. Identities with backgrounds,
travel histories, tax records, the works.

07:53.139 --> 07:58.102
Okay, wait, go back to Townsend.
You said we get to him through his sister.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.063
-How is that supposed to work?
-First we have to find her.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.734
There's a bounty hunter out of Bosnia,
Adin Marković.

08:04.817 --> 08:09.322
<i>He's supposed to be the best of the best.</i>
<i>We find him, then he finds Bremmer.</i>

08:09.405 --> 08:13.493
He hopes you're happy with the results
and would like to discuss his payment.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.870
[Skip] <i>Bremmer's</i>
<i>a chemical weapons dealer.</i>

08:15.953 --> 08:17.288
<i>She doesn't trust anyone.</i>

08:17.371 --> 08:20.166
Why would she trust or agree to help us?

08:20.249 --> 08:24.086
She won't.
Which is why we have to earn her trust.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.380
I was thinking of saving her life.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.673
Is it in jeopardy?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.675
Not that I know of. It will be.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.803
What do you know about Alban Veseli,
The Freelancer?

08:32.887 --> 08:35.806
<i>He was the first criminal</i>
<i>our task force put away.</i>

08:35.890 --> 08:38.559
He's been rotting in a hole
for seven years.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.020
Seven years ago,
Veseli derailed a passenger train

08:41.103 --> 08:43.022
<i>by making it hit a curve too fast.</i>

08:43.105 --> 08:46.526
[Liz] <i>I thought we'd use</i>
<i>Reddington's money, hire him a new lawyer.</i>

08:46.609 --> 08:47.735
<i>Someone we own.</i>

08:47.818 --> 08:50.488
-Who the hell are you?
-I don't think you got a fair trial.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.448
[Liz] <i>The lawyer files an appeal.</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:56.118
Claims the court violated
his client's 6th Amendment right

08:56.202 --> 08:57.995
to confront his accuser,

08:58.079 --> 09:02.166
who just so happens to be
the FBI's confidential source,

09:02.250 --> 09:03.584
Raymond Reddington.

09:03.668 --> 09:07.755
The U.S. government is willingly
in business with Raymond Reddington?

09:07.838 --> 09:11.300
But the feds will never
put Reddington in a courtroom.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.595
I'm a fugitive.
I'm not gonna show up in court either.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.764
I ordered Agent Keen to appear,
she didn't.

09:16.847 --> 09:22.019
So if the case agent doesn't show
and the confidential source doesn't show,

09:22.103 --> 09:25.439
the judge would be--
To say the least, he'd be concerned.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.608
[Velchek] <i>I'm not concerned. I'm offended.</i>

09:27.692 --> 09:31.028
I am granting the defendant's motion
to withdraw his guilty plea

09:31.112 --> 09:33.781
and I am forced
to dismiss the charges against him.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.782
Don't do this.

09:34.865 --> 09:38.661
You wanna release a mass murderer
in exchange for what?

09:38.744 --> 09:41.872
Ms. Keen arranged for your release
because she requires your services.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.624
What does she need me to do?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.710
I want him to kill Mary Bremmer.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.169
So you can save her.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.674
We get The Freelancer out of jail,
in exchange, he goes after Bremmer.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.802
He won't kill Bremmer,
because we're gonna grab her.

09:54.885 --> 09:55.720
[Skip] <i>I like it.</i>

09:55.803 --> 09:59.181
Except you told me
The Freelancer hides his assassinations

09:59.265 --> 10:01.767
by masking them
as mass-casualty accidents.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.146
There are 162 passengers onboard.
He'll kill everyone.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.273
I thought The Freelancer
was after Reddington.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.734
I'll back-channel information
through the task force

10:09.817 --> 10:11.652
and make sure no one gets hurt,

10:11.736 --> 10:14.238
and The Freelancer goes back to prison
where he belongs.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.865
Go back to Bremmer.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.952
You pull her off the street,
that woman ain't gonna be happy.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.331
I want to talk to her. Do you hear me?

10:23.414 --> 10:26.751
[Liz] <i>After I explain to her</i>
<i>that I not only saved her life,</i>

10:26.834 --> 10:30.046
I plucked her out of the arms
of the awaiting FBI,

<i>she might change her tune.</i>

In fact, she may even thank me
by offering to make an introduction

10:42.600 --> 10:44.894
to her brother, Neville Townsend.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.812
Bremmer said she's thought about it.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.441
She's willing to reach out to her brother,
see if she can make an introduction.

10:55.863 --> 10:59.909
<i>Well, Miss Keen.</i>

11:00.993 --> 11:03.871
<i>This is certainly unprecedented.</i>
<i>Where's Mary?</i>

11:03.954 --> 11:05.414
In FBI custody.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.626
She took her, what, to hurt me?

11:08.709 --> 11:11.671
-Talk to me. I'm right--
-...here. I'm looking right at you.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.590
Why did you take my sister?

11:14.673 --> 11:16.717
Because I had no way to reach you.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.553
Taking your sister
forced her to make contact,

11:19.637 --> 11:21.430
to negotiate her safe return--

11:21.514 --> 11:23.891
...and to get this
face-to-face meeting with you.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.936
-I had nothing--
-...to do with today's capture.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.312
[Townsend] <i>You're an FBI agent.</i>

11:28.396 --> 11:29.397
Not anymore.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.107
[Liz] The FBI can't help me.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.733
You can.

11:35.569 --> 11:39.615
[Kaplan] <i>You're doing well, Elizabeth.</i>
<i>Stay strong. He'll say yes.</i>

11:39.698 --> 11:43.577
I don't know if I can do this.
This animal hunted my mother.

in exchange for immunity.

<i>and the flash drive you sent Cooper.</i>

25:05.086 --> 25:08.215
If Reddington's really N-13,
we have a good chance of proving it.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.801
<i>And if we can... maybe you can come home.</i>

25:11.885 --> 25:13.637
That's all I care about, Liz.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.265
I mean, no,
maybe you can't be an agent again,

25:17.349 --> 25:21.061
<i>but at least you can get your life back,</i>
<i>you and Agnes can be together.</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:24.898
We gotta talk. Figure out how to end this.
I'll be at Bentham Park at midnight.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.816
<i>Meet me there. And, Keen...</i>

25:27.692 --> 25:28.902
<i>you can trust me.</i>

25:28.985 --> 25:29.986
[beeps]

25:31.363 --> 25:32.364
[exhales]

25:33.740 --> 25:35.533
Are you coming home tonight?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.244
[Liz] <i>Not tonight, honey.</i>

25:37.327 --> 25:41.289
But my being away so much,
I think is about to end.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.000
Is Mrs. French reading
<i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> to you?

25:44.084 --> 25:47.170
We're almost done. It's really good!

25:47.254 --> 25:48.213
[cell phone buzzing]

25:49.089 --> 25:52.884
You finish up and tell me all about it
when I get home, okay?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.761
<i>-Love you.</i>
-Love you too.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.597
Don't answer that.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.266
He could have good news.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.101
You should not be talking to the FBI.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.270
-You cannot take that call.
-Keen, it's me.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.523
I don't even know
if you get these messages.

26:06.606 --> 26:10.735
-I don't know who I'm talking to.
-Ressler says the task force has a source.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.322
His name is Rakitin
and he's willing to talk.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.742
If he does,
he could expose Reddington as N-13.

26:18.868 --> 26:20.662
He could end all of this.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.581
I wish that were true.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.627
But you don't need to hear his message
to know that's not the case.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.755
Look. Rakitin's dead.
I don't know how, but...

26:31.589 --> 26:33.216
Seems like he was poisoned.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.220
I mean, I really thought
it was over this time.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.975
We miss you. We just want you back.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.059
[engine starts]

26:45.937 --> 26:49.774
[Liz] <i>I told her it was over.</i>
<i>That I'd be coming home for good.</i>

26:49.858 --> 26:51.484
You're doing the best you can.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.863
I'm responsible for Mary Bremmer's murder,
Dembe's torture,

26:54.946 --> 26:58.199
and I got nothing to show for it
except for another reminder

26:58.283 --> 27:02.537
that no matter how tight the noose,
Reddington will always cheat the hangman.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.959
I heard from the police today.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.545
They found my husband's body.

27:11.421 --> 27:16.009
They say he died of natural causes,
but you know differently.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.553
I'm so sorry.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.097
Phillip was a good man.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.683
That whatever he was doing,

27:23.767 --> 27:27.979
he was doing because he believed
it was the right thing to do.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.150
I don't need sympathy.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.735
I need justice.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.780
You're the one who can get it for me.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.074
I tried. For all of us.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.285
I don't think I can keep trying.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.453
I understand.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.581
You thought you could end this.
You couldn't.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.416
You don't know who we're dealing with.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.670
But I do know this,
good triumphs over evil.

27:54.672 --> 27:57.175
I just don't think I have what it'll take.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.845
Of course you do. Every mother does.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.472
The love for her child.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.474
-Isn't that what saved you?
-Yes.

28:04.557 --> 28:07.143
Didn't your mother
give up everything for you?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.061
Yes.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.979
You think you should pay that forward?

28:10.063 --> 28:12.315
Of course, but I don't know how.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.983
You'll figure it out.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.528
How can you be so sure?

28:16.611 --> 28:18.988
Because love wins.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.532
You really believe that?

28:20.615 --> 28:26.788
I do. And seeing how you are with Agnes,
I believe you do too.

28:28.123 --> 28:28.998
[knocking on door]

28:33.086 --> 28:34.170
Elizabeth.

28:34.838 --> 28:35.922
Isabella, hi.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.173
Is my father okay?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.216
Dembe's fine.

28:38.800 --> 28:43.221
But I did come because
I think he could use your help.

28:46.266 --> 28:50.103
Thank God she was too young
to remember what happened to her.

28:50.186 --> 28:53.106
-I dread the day when I have to tell her.
<i>-Do you have to?</i>

28:53.189 --> 28:54.649
[Isabella] <i>I believe in the truth.</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:56.776
When she's ready, I'll tell her.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.112
Are you gonna tell her about your father?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.782
-He needs our help?
-He needs our protection.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.617
From Reddington.

29:05.326 --> 29:09.080
-Did he tell you that?
-No. He loves Reddington.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.917
That's based on a lie.
One that I'm not sure he knows about.

29:13.001 --> 29:17.714
Reddington isn't who he says he is.
I believe-- The bureau believes

29:17.797 --> 29:19.799
Reddington may be a Russian asset.

29:19.883 --> 29:20.884
What?

29:20.967 --> 29:23.803
We need proof.
With your help, we can get it.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.599
You're not here to help my father.
You're here to help yourself.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.267
I'm here to help us both.

29:29.350 --> 29:32.437
Most importantly,
I'm here to help our daughters.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.941
She's beautiful. She's innocent.

29:38.818 --> 29:41.529
One day when she's ready,
you're gonna tell her

29:41.613 --> 29:43.823
that when she was an infant,
she was abducted,

29:43.907 --> 29:46.743
<i>used as collateral so someone</i>
<i>could get to your father.</i>

29:46.826 --> 29:49.871
<i>You're going to tell her</i>
<i>as if it could never happen again.</i>

29:49.954 --> 29:53.875
But you and I both know,
as long as Reddington is in our lives,

29:53.958 --> 29:55.335
that isn't true.

29:56.544 --> 29:58.171
I won't hurt my father.

29:58.254 --> 30:02.133
-I would never ask you to.
-What do you want me to do?

30:02.926 --> 30:06.888
I need you to call your father.
Tell him you wanna see him.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.389
I haven't seen him in months.

30:09.057 --> 30:12.477
[Liz] <i>Better. You miss him.</i>
<i>You want him to spend time with Elle.</i>

30:14.145 --> 30:16.105
Hi. It's me.

30:16.606 --> 30:20.026
Once you've set a meeting,
I need you to plant this device.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.238
What do you want to hear him say?

30:23.321 --> 30:26.491
Nothing. I want to hear
what Reddington says to him.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.995
You really think this will help?

30:31.079 --> 30:35.708
I think with any luck, we can figure out
what Reddington is up to.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.794
[upbeat music playing]

30:45.844 --> 30:47.220
She's gotten so big.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.681
I know. Can you believe it?

30:51.307 --> 30:52.642
I'm glad you called.

30:53.226 --> 30:57.480
-We miss you, Dad.
-Do you? I wasn't sure.

30:57.564 --> 30:58.773
Of course we do.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.282
[Dembe] <i>Your heart can betray you.</i>
<i>How many times have you told me that?</i>

31:07.365 --> 31:09.492
[Raymond] <i>Anne is not betraying me.</i>

31:10.326 --> 31:13.079
We've run no names.
Done no background checks.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.331
On the good people of Cottonwood Falls?

31:15.415 --> 31:20.253
If you're lucky, you might find a late fee
for <i>Tom Sawyer</i> at the local library.

31:20.336 --> 31:23.089
-You're letting your guard down.
-That's not what I'm doing.

31:25.008 --> 31:30.054
Okay, it is what I'm doing.
But I'm having a splendid time doing it.

Hey. It's me.

I am so sorry. Are you okay?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.134
I should've seen you backing out.

32:08.217 --> 32:09.844
No. It was my fault.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.804
It's not that bad.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.307
Let me give you my insurance.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.645
[Liz sighs]

If we were in the city,

-you'd be screaming at me.
-[chuckles] You're not from here?

I rented a place on Chase Lake.

Hi, Cindi. I'm Anne.

Anne Foster. Of 429 Roslyn Place.

32:38.373 --> 32:41.918
That's it. Let me give you my cell too.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.712
If those insurance people
give you any trouble,

-I want you to give me a call, okay?
-If I'd known you'd be this nice,

32:48.007 --> 32:50.134
I would've run into you on purpose.

-You take care.
-You too, I'm sorry again.

with a nice smile or a nice ass.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.448
-But?
-I think punctuality is sexy.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.993

-Oh.

33:15.076 --> 33:18.538
Nice smile, nice ass, and on time.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.047
Of course. I'm sorry.

I brought this to thank you
for being so nice about what happened.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.094
Did you bake me a cake?

33:33.177 --> 33:36.431
-I hope you like red velvet.
-You are too thoughtful.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.142
Come in. Some friends and I
are about to play some bridge.

33:39.225 --> 33:43.688
No. I just came to drop that off.
I don't wanna intrude.

No, I'm sure we'll bump
into each other again soon.

Bye.

So much for the sexiest man alive.

I'm just saying, I like punctuality.

-Maybe his plane was delayed.
-Why hasn't he called?

34:06.669 --> 34:09.213

a dramatic entrance.

Why don't you run into town,

I just gotta check your ground wires.
It's standard.

Okay, very good.

you could have called.

I need you to come with me.

We've gotta call it off.

Reddington knows we're here.

-That changes nothing.
-We'll have other opportunities.

-Landon. She's gone.

and went to the police.
