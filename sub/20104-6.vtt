WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:05.406
We're gonna get
you out of here.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.507
(speaking Arabic)

00:09.777 --> 00:11.412
Poseidon put us in
here to get Ramal out,

00:11.445 --> 00:12.880
but then he
abandoned us.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.982
Ramal is Poseidon's
guy, not ours.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.218
MICHAEL:
The escape is on.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.686
He's my brother!

00:19.753 --> 00:20.988
Who the hell
is this Poseidon guy?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.057
A frustrated policy wonk

00:23.091 --> 00:24.858
in the CIA,
who created a cell

00:24.892 --> 00:27.995
within the CIA called 21-Void.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.530
And he needed my help

00:29.563 --> 00:32.400
breaking out people imprisoned
all over the world.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.171
LINCOLN:
We've awoken something.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.573
Any chance Poseidon
will just let us kill her?

00:39.607 --> 00:41.175
Point.
It's three and four.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.411
The man, and the woman
was the shooter.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.912
Step back!
That's not
gonna happen.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.880
Go to hell!

00:46.914 --> 00:48.782
(yells)

00:48.816 --> 00:50.484
WHIP: Let's get
the hell out of here!

00:51.385 --> 00:54.522
(speaking Arabic)

00:54.555 --> 00:57.591
(cheering)

00:57.625 --> 01:01.195
C-NOTE: The only way out now
is up, brother.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.231
I'm so sorry.
Sorry, brother.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.633
(plane flying overhead)

01:13.307 --> 01:15.243
(men shouting)

01:17.411 --> 01:19.247
WHIP:
We got to move.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.915
No. We go out on the streets
tonight, we're dead.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.317
You know it
and I know it.

01:23.351 --> 01:26.654
Even on the outside,
I feel the world crushing in.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.556
LINCOLN: That's what
being locked up does.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.024
You carry the prison
with you on the outside.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.094
I can't live that way.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.465
I've got to know
the walls disappear.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.901
It's called being scared.
Happens when you're sober.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.103
Don't give me the pill talk.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.273
I won't give you
the poor little orphan talk.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.507
How your friend here

01:46.540 --> 01:48.309
isn't the father figure
you thought he was gonna be.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.543
This isn't helping.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.313
The walls are going
away, brother.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.615
We're gonna make 'em go away.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.783
We're getting out
of this country.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.318
All of us.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.253
WHIP: Oh, really? Which
contingency's that gonna be?

01:59.287 --> 02:00.454
You burned
through them all.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.790
Truck to border, train, airport.

02:02.823 --> 02:03.957
MICHAEL:
None of those.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.293
We're exactly where

02:05.326 --> 02:07.928
I don't want to be:
improvising.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.298
Well, we need to
improvise something real fast

02:10.330 --> 02:11.799
or it's gonna be us down there,

02:11.832 --> 02:13.100
strung up like that.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.102
Omar. Sheba's guy.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.870
She said he
had a way out.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.105
We can trust him?

02:18.138 --> 02:21.709
No. But he's our last option.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.385
(door buzzes)

02:36.990 --> 02:40.428
You made bail.
You're being released.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.266
WOMAN:
Mmm! Don't be a stranger, sugar.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.173
Poseidon got you out first.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.176
I thought I was his favorite.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.716
A&W: Son of a bitch
really escaped.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.151
Yep.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.256
But why kill Ramal?
I thought they were allies.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.659
It's not our job
to ask questions.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.060
Maybe we should.

03:13.093 --> 03:17.998
Poseidon says we find
Kaniel Outis and kill him.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.601
That's what we're gonna do.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.172
And I think I know how to do it.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.208
(explosions, men yelling)

03:28.242 --> 03:31.745
(men yelling, women screaming)

03:31.779 --> 03:34.582
LINCOLN:
Omar.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.750
(mumbles in Arabic)

03:38.286 --> 03:40.288
What are you doing here?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.290
You're radioactive, my friend.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.126
You killed Abu Ramal. Really?

03:46.159 --> 03:49.129
That was a very stupid move,
man.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.564
Just tell us
where you're headed.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.437
300 miles across the desert.
Phaeacia.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.205
Old smuggling
friends.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.574
Uh, autonomous zone. No ISIL.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.775
Perfect.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.544
Not perfect.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.647
Four of you, one of me.
Not enough seats.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.482
Okay, okay, all right. What
about getting another vehicle?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.050
Tell you what.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.886
Because it's Sheba
and I owe her,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.623
maybe we can help each other.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.057
I have another vehicle.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.125
A Land Cruiser.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.827
I was going to
leave it behind,

04:19.860 --> 04:21.329
but if you can get it,

04:21.362 --> 04:23.897
it's in a parking garage
two blocks from here.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.233
I'll let you follow.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.402
Deliver my second vehicle,

04:28.436 --> 04:31.104
and maybe I get the Phaeacians
to get you a boat somewhere,

04:31.138 --> 04:33.407
to Europe, France, Italy, Spain,
wherever you want to go.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.275
How's that sound?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.046
Keys are here.

04:41.515 --> 04:45.353
Uh, left side, the red brick.
First floor.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.588
Battery might be dead,
so you might need

04:47.621 --> 04:49.222
all of you to push.
We got it.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.960
Whip, you stay with him.
Let's move.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.001
He always give you orders
like that?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.574
It's complicated.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.009
I got an order for you.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.612
Load up.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.313
One more bag inside.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.488
JA:
There!

05:21.755 --> 05:23.491
Give it a push on my say.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.695
(engine starts)

05:28.996 --> 05:31.399
Battery's working
perfectly.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.702
How far away is this garage?

05:34.735 --> 05:37.838
Only two blocks.
No problem.
(sighs)

05:37.871 --> 05:39.773
Someone says there's no problem,
there's always a problem.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.713
He set us up.
Get in!

05:47.448 --> 05:50.818
(yelling in Arabic)

05:50.851 --> 05:52.085
Hold on!

05:53.053 --> 05:55.623
(automatic gunfire)

06:02.963 --> 06:03.964
(tires screech)

06:05.365 --> 06:06.967
(yelling in Arabic)

06:16.376 --> 06:18.378
*

06:57.117 --> 06:59.553
Nothing personal, my friend.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.990
In another life, no doubt
we smoke the hookah together.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.024
(grunts)

07:07.828 --> 07:09.763
(vehicle approaching)

07:11.999 --> 07:13.100
(muffled groan)

07:15.302 --> 07:16.704
(groans loudly)

07:19.172 --> 07:20.741
LINCOLN: No!
No, you don't!

07:20.774 --> 07:23.010
(groans, grunts)

07:26.514 --> 07:27.748
Whip, you okay?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.416
Thought you were gonna be
a millionaire, huh?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.450
I didn't have a choice.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.820
(grunts)

07:32.853 --> 07:35.789
Come on! Coldcocking
son of a bitch!

07:35.823 --> 07:38.626
Hold on, hold on. Easy
now, we may need him.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.628
Yes. You need me.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.995
(groans)

07:42.029 --> 07:44.464
I want a map
to this Phaeacia place.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.534
You do realize this is Yemen,
don't you?

07:46.567 --> 07:49.670
Phaeacia
is a hundred people.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.905
Mud huts. There is no map.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.709
But I can lead you there.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.812
You want to
trust this guy?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.714
Well, if he screws with us,

08:00.748 --> 08:03.050
we'll just let Whip finish
what he started.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.852
And I will kill you.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.020
(chuckles) I can't wait
to kill him.

08:07.054 --> 08:10.457
You coldcock me, I end you.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.893
Rule number one in my country.
Okay?

08:12.926 --> 08:15.462
And rule number one
in my country is

08:15.495 --> 08:17.731
when things get bad,
go to the desert.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.184
We are desperate, desperate men.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.886
Not as desperate as Omar
right now.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.388
If there's one man
you don't want

08:41.421 --> 08:43.090
to get on the wrong side of,
it's Whip.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.327
That might apply to you, too,
Michael.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.730
I get the sense the kid thinks
you betrayed him somehow.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.734
I could understand
why he thinks that.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.681
I really am sorry, my friend.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.850
When I'm scared,
I make poor choices.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.652
Zero comes out of your mouth.
Okay?

09:13.921 --> 09:17.390
I'm having a really bad
couple days. Just the worst.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.128
(sighs)

09:26.299 --> 09:27.868
(knocking)

09:27.901 --> 09:29.903
Agent Kishida.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.274
Settling into your new office,
I see.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.977
I still see this
as Kellerman's office, ma'am.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.315
As you probably know,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.417
before
he was killed,

09:44.451 --> 09:46.954
Kellerman had been
looking into 21-Void.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.389
I knew that. Yes.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.091
I need Paul's files.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.226
Obviously, he was getting close
to something

09:53.260 --> 09:55.729
and they killed him
for it.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.731
Actually, I've been
looking into his leads,

09:57.765 --> 09:59.466
and there's nothing there.

09:59.499 --> 10:03.103
I hate to say it, but this file
is full of dead ends.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.938
There's nothing here.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.240
There must be something.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.010
Look, I don't want Paul
to have died in vain,

10:10.043 --> 10:12.279
but we need to look at this
whole thing with new eyes.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.681
Read it for yourself.

10:16.717 --> 10:20.020
Okay, you want to put
new eyes on this? Fine.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.689
Now that you
report to me,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.290
I need you to look
into the possibility

10:23.323 --> 10:24.925
that there was an insider
involved.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.594
Here? At the State Department?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.430
Anywhere along
the evidence chain.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.132
Will do, ma'am.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.014
(phone ringing)

10:47.715 --> 10:49.049
Agent Kishida.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.784
I wasn't expecting
a call at this hour.

10:50.818 --> 10:54.187
I just wanted to follow up
on our earlier conversation.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.622
The situation
in the Middle East?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.225
Situation's developing.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.828
We need to meet soon.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.863
Fair enough.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.932
The moment we're back,
we'll call you.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.038
You worked at NSA?

11:12.405 --> 11:16.076
Team Eye in the Sky
for ten years.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.345
Watched the most heinous crap
you can imagine

11:18.378 --> 11:20.380
by satellite.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.681
Stonings, rapes.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.753
Just had to sit back and watch
it like a horror film, helpless,

11:25.786 --> 11:27.988
until Poseidon
tapped my shoulder,

11:28.021 --> 11:30.523
gave me a chance to do
something about it.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.862
Emily, good to see you again.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.163
Likewise.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.498
You got my message?
Kaniel Outis?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.034
You gonna help
us locate him?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.270
Look, protocol says no.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.339
We stay clear of CIA,
any offensive action.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.908
We're surveillance
only.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.276
We just want to put eyes on him.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.782
I think I can get you
in as observers

11:54.815 --> 11:56.483
under interagency auspices.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.452
I knew I could count on you.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.954
But you owe me.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.791
That B&B we went up to
in Connecticut,

12:03.824 --> 12:05.325
I want that weekend again.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.330
That exact weekend.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.442
What you got
back here, anyway?

12:22.475 --> 12:24.177
What is this, guns, drugs?

12:25.678 --> 12:27.114
Fireworks?

12:27.147 --> 12:29.216
OMAR: You don't
understand the Phaeacians.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.651
They are beautiful. Generous.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.387
They just want to smile.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.655
Unlike you.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.390
Oh, is that right?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.626
Ah, holding grudges.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.328
It's very bad for the heart...

12:41.361 --> 12:42.963
You know what else
is bad for your heart?

12:42.996 --> 12:45.632
If I shove a Roman candle
through the middle of it.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.677
Ja, please.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.979
Don't check out on us.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.183
Still trying to figure out
why you got me out.

13:03.216 --> 13:07.087
I need that great big mind
of yours clean and clear.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.022
(phone ringing)

13:11.158 --> 13:13.026
JA: It's the number from
the airport last night.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.596
C-Note, what's up?

13:16.629 --> 13:17.965
SHEBA:
Lincoln, it's Sheba.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.299
I got Benjamin's phone.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.934
Oh, hi.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.936
Did you find Omar?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.704
Yeah, we found him.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.006
We're traveling.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.807
You okay?

13:27.841 --> 13:29.943
Yes.
We're in Jordan.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.646
Leaving for the U.S. tonight.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.215
How's C-Note?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.317
He's fine.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.053
We all are.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.655
Everyone.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.291
We're going to make it.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.693
It's because of you.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.528
(chuckles)
Because of my money.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.898
It's because of you.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.365
Come on.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.734
There is nobility in you,
Lincoln.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.236
Hey, uh...

13:57.871 --> 14:00.173
when I get back,
I'll, I'll buy you a drink.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.509
I don't drink.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.512
But I'll buy you a drink.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.779
How about that?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.682
Sounds good.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.055
MAN:
We got a hit;

14:15.088 --> 14:16.656
Franklin's cell phone
lit up in Jordan.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.725
A&W: The one he bought
with a credit card in Yemen

14:18.758 --> 14:20.693
a few days ago.
Making an outbound call
to an unknown number.

14:20.727 --> 14:24.231
Currently right
outside Sana'a, Yemen.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.266
Rerouting a drone
to that target now.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.867
We just found our man,
didn't we?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.277
There. Two vehicles
heading west.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.545
Drones in position.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.812
Let's take a peek.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.619
TECH:
They're stopping.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.888
TRICIA: Pull up all known data
on that location.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.427
Why did we stop?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.596
Phaeacia is 300 miles that way.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.600
We need to fill our
gas tanks up to the top.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.205
As-salamu 'alaykum.
Alaykumu s-salaam.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.206
Michael, where you going?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.374
Been under Poseidon's thumb

15:07.407 --> 15:08.942
for the last seven years.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.812
It's about time I got
out from under it.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.514
Internet?

15:15.615 --> 15:16.849
Shukraan.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.159
They have no clue we're
watching, do they?

15:26.193 --> 15:29.096
Not at this height.

15:32.199 --> 15:35.168
(man shouting in Arabic)

15:39.439 --> 15:40.640
(speaking in Arabic)

15:40.673 --> 15:41.908
(phone ringing)

15:41.941 --> 15:44.644
(man yelling, metal slicing)

15:44.677 --> 15:46.313
Who is this?

15:46.346 --> 15:48.915
A friend from far away.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.751
Your government has always
considered us an enemy.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.153
Officially.

15:53.186 --> 15:58.091
But some of us have
a more enlightened view.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.927
Abu Ramal was a great visionary.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.596
You have our
sincerest condolences.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.797
What do you want?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.099
The same thing you do,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.601
to eliminate the men
who killed him.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.004
And as a sign of good faith...

16:13.573 --> 16:15.875
we'll tell you exactly
where they are.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.820
MALE VOICE:
Hey, can you see me?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.156
Not yet.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.690
Blasted computer camera thing.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.125
Who makes these things?

16:32.159 --> 16:33.960
All right, I see you.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.163
CYCLOPS: Come on, hurry.
Get this off of me.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.298
YASSER:
Hold your hand still.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.566
Just do it already.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.302
Do you want to stay like this?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.871
You're lucky
we cut you loose.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.146
ISIL LIEUTENANT (over radio):
The men who killed Abu Ramal,

16:53.180 --> 16:55.715
Leaving Sana'a, heading west
on Highway 80.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.983
Okay.
Highway 80.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.251
We're leaving now.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.187
(yells in Arabic)

17:00.220 --> 17:01.421
(men yelling in Arabic)

17:03.190 --> 17:04.691
I'm coming, too.
No.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.128
This is not your fight anymore.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.098
Understand?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.615
(yelling in Arabic)

17:32.719 --> 17:34.154
(driver yells)

17:46.133 --> 17:48.601
You know it's been four years
since I've had air conditioning?

17:48.635 --> 17:49.969
I'm done with the heat.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.173
Kind of like it out here.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.110
No walls.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.078
No walls, okay?
Ain't about walls.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.913
(clicks tongue)

18:00.947 --> 18:02.382
My opinion,
you know what you need

18:02.415 --> 18:03.916
more than anything else
in the world?

18:03.950 --> 18:05.552
Got to laugh more.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.387
If he wants to laugh,

18:07.420 --> 18:08.955
Phaeacia's the place.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.923
I always wanted
to bring Sheba;

18:10.957 --> 18:12.159
for her to see
the people.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.427
No technology,
no politics,

18:14.461 --> 18:15.795
no modern nonsense.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.464
They know how
to enjoy life.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.065
No technology?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.300
Freddie Mercury here
couldn't hack it.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.568
Freddie Mercury?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.069
I could hack it.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.172
I was alive before cell phones.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.773
You're more addicted to
that screen than you are

18:26.806 --> 18:28.375
to them pills, and that
is saying something.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.846
(man yells in Arabic)

18:33.880 --> 18:35.114
(radio chirps)

18:35.148 --> 18:36.349
Be ready.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.286
Ah, my friends.
We got problems!

18:39.319 --> 18:41.354
Michael, we got to go!

18:41.388 --> 18:43.022
Michael?
Let's go!

18:43.055 --> 18:44.291
I got to go.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.758
Hold on, let me try
something else.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.993
Can you see me now?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.861
No. Take a screen capture.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.129
What of?

18:50.163 --> 18:52.532
A screen capture. Take it.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.135
ISIL militants
coming from the east.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.970
This should get interesting.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.977
Don't think one bullet is going
to get us out of this.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.880
One bullet? Who the hell carries
a gun with one bullet?

19:07.914 --> 19:10.483
The man who would kill himself
before being captured by ISIL.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.051
(men yelling in Arabic)

19:13.586 --> 19:15.655
(screams)
Michael!

19:15.688 --> 19:18.358
(tires screech,
men speaking in Arabic)

19:23.696 --> 19:24.664
(yells)

19:24.697 --> 19:26.399
Get closer. Zoom in.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.668
TRICIA:
Hold on.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.037
These militants,
how'd they find them?

19:31.070 --> 19:32.872
LINCOLN: Goddamn it, what are
you waiting for? Shoot back!

19:32.905 --> 19:34.307
We only got one bullet.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.775
One bullet?
Exactly.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.179
(gunfire)

19:41.714 --> 19:43.550
We're seriously
screwed here.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.685
Unless I can make
this one bullet count.

19:45.718 --> 19:46.953
What?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.459
(grunts)

19:53.460 --> 19:56.195
(men screaming and groaning)

20:01.701 --> 20:03.903
(Whip groans)

20:03.936 --> 20:06.339
You sure as hell
made it count, kid.
(mumbles)

20:06.373 --> 20:08.408
(coughs)
Hell yeah, you did.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.776
(groans)

20:11.611 --> 20:13.313
LINCOLN:
My God!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.783
Michael.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.217
He's in a
bad way, Linc.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.586
(Omar groaning)

20:25.325 --> 20:27.660
More coming, we got to get
the hell out of here!

20:51.784 --> 20:54.086
(brakes grind, men groaning)

21:06.766 --> 21:08.735
(gurgles, sputters)

21:08.768 --> 21:10.770
(gasping)

21:16.309 --> 21:18.311
(groaning)

21:36.829 --> 21:37.964
What are they stopping for?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.065
LINCOLN:
Don't know.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.008
We can't go any further.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.109
We can go a lot further.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.378
We've got to get to Phaeacia.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.712
There's no roads, Whip.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.981
The roads are in Omar's
head along with the map.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.283
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.386
Our map is dead.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.800
We got to head back.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.035
To what?

22:16.068 --> 22:18.004
He's right.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.472
We'll die out there
without a map.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.207
We don't know that.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.175
We 99% know that.

22:23.209 --> 22:24.744
(gunshots)

22:27.547 --> 22:29.048
Guess we're not
out of the woods yet!

22:29.081 --> 22:30.383
We got to lose this guy,
whoever he is!

22:30.417 --> 22:32.419
Let's go!
Then move it, damn it.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.021
(yells)

22:43.763 --> 22:45.064
(engine starts)

22:50.870 --> 22:53.272
All targets now bearing 2:15.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.741
Stay with them.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.909
No. Pull the drone.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.411
Time for our visitors to leave.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.379
What are you talking about?

23:00.413 --> 23:01.614
We find Kaniel Outis in Yemen,

23:01.648 --> 23:03.550
and then rebels show up
to take him out?

23:03.583 --> 23:05.384
Was I supposed to think
that was a coincidence?

23:05.418 --> 23:07.353
This isn't surveillance,
is it?

23:07.386 --> 23:09.088
This is assassination.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.724
You're using me for some sort
of black work, aren't you?

23:11.758 --> 23:14.461
This is way over your head,
Tricia.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.429
Stop asking questions.

23:16.463 --> 23:20.132
If you don't get out of my
sight, I will blow the whistle.

23:20.166 --> 23:23.135
Right now.

23:26.973 --> 23:31.143
Would've been a hell
of a weekend in Connecticut.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.285
VAN GOGH: It's playing
with fire,

23:39.318 --> 23:41.253
co-opting other
agencies like that.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.889
You think she'll talk?

23:42.922 --> 23:46.125
Run it up the flag pole?

23:46.158 --> 23:48.327
You got designs on killing her?

23:48.360 --> 23:50.763
I'll kill you.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.833
Relax, will you?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.806
I'm getting pretty tired
of chasing Outis.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.575
Always being behind him.
Me, too.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.677
That's why I keep thinking about
all that time that he spent

24:04.711 --> 24:07.580
in that gas
station in Yemen.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.415
ISIL on his tail,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.484
and he just hangs in there?

24:11.518 --> 24:15.454
What was he
doing in there?

24:28.200 --> 24:30.670
The sun is directly overhead.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.639
I can't tell which way
is east, west...

24:32.672 --> 24:34.841
We got to stop.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.549
MICHAEL:
Hey, Ja.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.016
You got a compass on that phone?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.018
No signal.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.120
We're flying blind.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.322
Completely blind.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.563
But he's not.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.966
We're leaving him a beautiful
set of tire tracks to follow.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.568
Who the hell is this guy?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.506
MICHAEL:
It's the guy who killed Sid.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.376
Son of a bitch is like
a dog with a bone, huh?

25:10.409 --> 25:12.545
You kill someone's
spiritual leader,

25:12.579 --> 25:15.147
they'll follow you to the ends
of the Earth, apparently.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.183
Why is he stopping?

25:18.718 --> 25:20.019
MICHAEL:
He's refueling.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.487
JA:
Now?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.156
He knows he's got
more gas than we do.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.726
All he has to do
is follow our tracks.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.895
Then wait until we run out.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.563
WHIP:
There are four of us.

25:30.597 --> 25:31.898
Let's just swarm him,
take him out.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.032
LINCOLN:
Not out here.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.867
Not with an AK-47.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.502
We wouldn't get
within a hundred feet of him

25:36.535 --> 25:37.937
without taking a bullet.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.639
Then we got to outthink him.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.909
(opens door)

25:42.942 --> 25:45.344
What you gonna do
with that, flog him?

25:45.377 --> 25:47.179
Gonna transfer gas
from that tank to this one.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.048
Almost all of it.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.583
It's not gonna help.

25:50.617 --> 25:54.721
It's gonna help this one
get to Phaeacia.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.022
We pile into one vehicle?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.556
He still has more gas than us.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.258
He can still follow
our tire tracks.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.228
That's why we leave a little bit
of gas in that one.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.130
And make two sets of tracks.

26:04.163 --> 26:08.000
He's gonna have to choose.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.876
I got four rocks in my hand.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.477
Three red, one white.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.881
Get the red rock,
get in the Jeep, go to Phaeacia.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.050
Get the white rock,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.518
deal with our friend.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.494
Stick out your hand.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.933
Red.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.039
Whip. Come on.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.711
Red.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.483
Linc.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.955
No.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.124
You knew the rules, Linc.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.861
He's picking up again.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.430
I'm not leaving you out here
to die.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.165
I have no intention
of dying.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.601
Anyway, you've got
the harder job.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.704
You've gotta find Phaeacia
out there somewhere.

27:17.737 --> 27:21.640
Leave tracks...
so I know how to find you.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.850
(engine revving)

27:42.995 --> 27:45.531
Just one.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.904
You want to play,
you son of a bitch?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.289
Now how the hell
am I gonna get out of this?

28:32.779 --> 28:35.447
LINCOLN:
We're driving blind.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.850
It's the same damn thing
everywhere we look.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.086
There's something
to be said for that.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.387
Makes you use your senses.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.721
Will you stop talking crap

28:42.755 --> 28:44.123
and talk elephant
in the room, please?

28:44.156 --> 28:45.858
We just left Michael back there.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.193
It's completely wrong.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.196
I'm the last guy
you want to say that to.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.563
Well, why are we doing it, then?

28:51.597 --> 28:52.598
Because he said, that's why.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.968
One thing you
don't understand:

28:56.002 --> 28:57.569
when Michael takes on the world,

28:57.603 --> 28:59.972
the world
always loses.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.916
(beeping)

29:25.697 --> 29:27.699
*

29:39.111 --> 29:41.513
(birds squawking)

29:41.547 --> 29:43.515
We've been looking
the whole time.

29:43.549 --> 29:44.750
That's the problem.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.852
What?

29:45.885 --> 29:47.820
Stop the engine.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.699
JA:
You hear that?

30:01.733 --> 30:03.035
Birds?

30:03.069 --> 30:05.437
JA:
Not just birds. Gulls.

30:05.471 --> 30:09.208
As far as I know, gulls got
no interest in the desert.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.277
They only got interest
in the sea.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.711
WHIP:
It means we're close.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.080
All you got to do
is follow them.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.816
Maybe we got GPS after all.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.654
(engine starts)

30:38.704 --> 30:40.672
*

31:02.461 --> 31:04.463
(tires screeching)

31:27.719 --> 31:29.721
(engine rumbling in distance)

31:38.497 --> 31:40.499
(children clamoring)

31:52.244 --> 31:53.545
LINCOLN:
Is this Phaeacia?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.948
CHILDREN:
Phaeacia! Phaeacia!

32:00.086 --> 32:03.055
CHILD:
Omar! Omar!

32:03.089 --> 32:06.125
BOTH:
Omar, Omar.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.563
Hello.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.966
(children saying hello)

32:18.304 --> 32:21.240
You bring Omar car,
but not Omar?

32:21.273 --> 32:24.643
Omar had to go somewhere safe.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.945
Because of the war?

32:26.979 --> 32:30.216
Yeah, the war. That's right.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.553
He told us to bring
this stuff for you.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.225
Also said you could arrange
a boat for us.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.052
*

33:34.880 --> 33:37.583
(car engine revving)

33:56.302 --> 33:57.669
(Cyclops shouts)

33:57.703 --> 34:00.306
(grunts, screams)

34:11.550 --> 34:13.619
(both grunting)

34:31.837 --> 34:34.505
(screaming)

34:42.781 --> 34:44.783
(groans)

34:51.089 --> 34:55.092
Back in the city...

34:55.127 --> 34:57.596
I told you you would die.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.598
(groaning)

35:01.099 --> 35:04.770
We will both die out here,
American!

35:34.466 --> 35:37.203
A&W: Turns out that gas station
outside Sana'a

35:37.236 --> 35:39.171
had a computer
with Internet access.

35:39.205 --> 35:42.374
VAN GOGH: He sent this
image from Yemen. Why?

35:42.408 --> 35:44.676
We're gonna find out
as soon as as soon as we talk

35:44.710 --> 35:46.011
to the guy he sent it to.

35:47.713 --> 35:50.882
Blue Hawaii in
Portland, Maine.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.718
Think we got a snowbird?

35:52.751 --> 35:54.986
I don't think that's quite it.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.232
(doorbell rings)

36:16.542 --> 36:18.744
Welcome to Graceland.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.679
Don't just stand there
and let the AC out.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.684
Come on in.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.891
What can I do
for you fine folks?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.305
MICHAEL:
Linc, where are your tracks?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.209
(grunts)

37:02.488 --> 37:04.456
(engine sputtering)

37:05.591 --> 37:07.559
MICHAEL:
No tracks, no tracks.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.834
No, no, no, no!

37:23.241 --> 37:26.745
No, no. No.

37:26.778 --> 37:30.115
Come on. Come on!

37:30.148 --> 37:32.818
(sighs, grunts)

37:37.255 --> 37:39.257
(grunting)

37:58.276 --> 38:00.812
Come on, Mike, come on.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.449
Where are the tracks?

38:03.482 --> 38:05.651
(grunts) Where are the tracks?

38:09.388 --> 38:11.122
JA:
This is for you. Look.

38:11.156 --> 38:12.290
(imitates explosion)

38:12.324 --> 38:14.092
(children clamor in excitement)

38:14.125 --> 38:16.862
W-Wait, go easy, go easy.
Start with the small stuff.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.898
Flowers, snakes, we'll move
onto the artillery later.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.006
Fireworks okay?
Yes, yes, of course.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.575
It's okay to do this?
Thank you.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.211
Omar was right.

38:33.244 --> 38:36.047
This place.

38:36.081 --> 38:39.585
It's like the rest of the world
doesn't exist.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.921
I'll go check on Linc.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.326
Hanging in there?

38:48.360 --> 38:52.631
You're right. I shouldn't
have abandoned him.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.033
If he doesn't find those
tire tracks by nightfall,

38:55.066 --> 38:56.402
he never will.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.238
Where are you going?

39:00.271 --> 39:01.507
Going out to find him.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.375
You can't go out there at night.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.876
You'll never find him.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.713
Doing nothing's not an option.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.115
I didn't say do nothing.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.576
(grunts)

39:50.489 --> 39:51.890
You got to have faith.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.763
Sarah...

40:02.300 --> 40:03.769
Sarah.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.355
(fireworks whistling, exploding)

40:39.671 --> 40:41.840
(children shouting, clamoring)

40:49.447 --> 40:50.682
Michael!

40:52.150 --> 40:54.553
Michael!

40:58.289 --> 41:01.126
Michael!

41:14.072 --> 41:16.074
(sighs)

41:25.150 --> 41:26.552
That's it.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.255
(people shouting)

41:43.569 --> 41:44.536
Michael.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.204
Thank God, you made it.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.239
He poisoned me.

41:48.273 --> 41:49.575
What?!
Antifreeze.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.880
Need a doctor.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.347
Get the doctor now.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.716
The doctor, the only doctor
is in Sana'a.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.384
We can't go back to Sana'a.

41:59.417 --> 42:00.752
WHIP:
We just came from there.

42:00.786 --> 42:02.688
It's 300 miles across
the friggin' desert.

42:02.721 --> 42:05.356
We gotta do something.
He's dying.

42:05.390 --> 42:08.226
Michael, Michael.
