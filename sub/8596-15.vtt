WEBVTT

00:01.336 --> 00:02.545
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.754 --> 00:05.757
You should have
killed me on that battlefield.

00:05.966 --> 00:07.801
Uh!

00:08.009 --> 00:09.427
He's strong.

00:09.636 --> 00:10.637
We need him if we're gonna
fight our way out of here!

00:10.845 --> 00:12.180
- Listen to me!
- Nngh!

00:12.389 --> 00:13.264
Do you
want your revenge,

00:13.473 --> 00:15.517
or do you want
your people alive?

00:15.725 --> 00:17.519
Uh!

00:17.727 --> 00:19.187
Ugh!

00:19.396 --> 00:21.398
Grab the keys. She's
gonna send for reinforcements.

00:21.606 --> 00:23.316
Until
we find it a host,

00:23.525 --> 00:25.568
we won't know
how to stop Alie.

00:25.777 --> 00:27.320
Then let's
find it a host.

00:27.529 --> 00:29.280
Once we find Luna,
this'll be over.

00:29.489 --> 00:31.992
Ontari'll be
exposed as a fraud,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.411
and the a.I. Will tell us
how to shut down Alie.

00:34.619 --> 00:35.912
What will you
do with Clarke?

00:36.121 --> 00:38.581
I will give her the same
choice as the rest.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.294
Luna, you're
the last Nightblood.

00:43.503 --> 00:45.547
Will you take it and
become the next commander?

00:45.755 --> 00:47.674
No.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.759
Now what?

01:01.271 --> 01:03.064
Rover's
almost charged.

01:03.273 --> 01:05.025
We need to pack up.
We'll be home soon.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.068
Then what,
run away?

01:07.277 --> 01:08.862
We're not running
away, Clarke.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.238
We need to regroup
with the others,

01:10.447 --> 01:11.448
and find another
way to defeat--

01:11.656 --> 01:13.450
there is no
other way.

01:13.658 --> 01:15.452
We need to
find a Nightblood.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.371
We need to
unlock the flame.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.498
It's the only way
to stop Alie.

01:20.707 --> 01:22.584
What do you expect
us to do, Clarke,

01:22.792 --> 01:24.461
walk into
random villages

01:24.669 --> 01:26.296
asking for
their nightbloods?

01:26.504 --> 01:27.922
If that's
what it takes.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.424
No, Clarke.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.509
If Alie can find us
on Luna’s rig,

01:31.718 --> 01:32.886
then she can
find us anywhere.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.220
I won't
help you destroy

01:34.429 --> 01:37.265
another innocent
grounder village.

01:37.474 --> 01:40.226
If we don't
find a Nightblood,

01:40.435 --> 01:43.563
there won't be any
grounder villages

01:43.772 --> 01:45.565
or a home for us
to go back to.

01:45.774 --> 01:47.984
That's all the more
reason we go there

01:48.193 --> 01:51.654
and make sure
our friends are OK.

02:07.003 --> 02:09.964
She'll be fine.
Just let her cool off.

02:39.619 --> 02:41.621
I'm sorry.

02:45.834 --> 02:48.294
Bring her to me
with the flame.

02:52.507 --> 02:54.551
Agh!

03:01.516 --> 03:03.351
Roan?

03:03.560 --> 03:04.727
Looks like I'm not
the only one

03:04.936 --> 03:08.815
who's been following
your tracks.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.608
Give that back.

03:10.817 --> 03:12.569
Good-bye, Wanheda.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.320
Wait.

03:18.867 --> 03:19.701
You have a real
gratitude problem.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.871
You know that?

03:23.079 --> 03:24.789
Would you just
hear me out?

03:24.998 --> 03:26.583
I need to find
a Nightblood

03:26.791 --> 03:27.876
to put that in.

03:28.084 --> 03:30.295
I already have
a Nightblood to put it in.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.755
Please
just stop.

03:32.964 --> 03:35.508
Because of you,
Ontari never ascended,

03:35.717 --> 03:37.051
so, no, I won't stop,

03:37.260 --> 03:39.679
not until the ice nation
has its commander.

03:39.888 --> 03:42.557
You were
saying?

03:42.765 --> 03:44.809
Hands where
I can see them.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.314
You OK?

03:49.522 --> 03:50.648
Yeah.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.275
Then let's go.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.319
- He's coming with us.
- The hell he is.

03:54.527 --> 03:55.820
Why would
I do that?

03:56.029 --> 03:57.906
Because we both
want the same thing--

03:58.114 --> 04:01.159
to put the flame
in Ontari.

04:03.912 --> 04:05.914
How do you know
he's not chipped?

04:06.122 --> 04:08.917
If he were, do you think
he would've saved me?

04:10.168 --> 04:13.213
Still, we need
to be sure.

04:14.505 --> 04:15.381
Agh!

04:15.590 --> 04:17.508
Uh!

04:19.719 --> 04:21.596
Now we're sure.

05:01.719 --> 05:04.514
Lock it up.

05:11.229 --> 05:13.356
Glad you
made it back.

05:15.275 --> 05:17.777
We were
getting worried.

05:19.821 --> 05:22.198
Where's Luna?

05:22.407 --> 05:24.993
Luna said no.

05:26.244 --> 05:27.912
Who the hell
is this?

05:28.121 --> 05:29.372
He's
ice nation.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.332
King of the ice
nation, actually,

05:31.541 --> 05:34.294
and he's our way
into Polis.

05:35.420 --> 05:36.796
This way,
your highness.

05:37.005 --> 05:38.548
You two, on me.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.050
We'll take him
to lockup.

05:44.554 --> 05:46.806
You want to use him
to get to Ontari.

05:47.015 --> 05:49.058
- Yes.
- What happened to his arm?

05:49.267 --> 05:51.853
Bellamy shot him.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.772
Good luck getting
him to cooperate.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.129
Sorry about
your arm.

06:18.338 --> 06:20.923
Makes us
even.

06:21.132 --> 06:23.176
Like it or not,
we need each other.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.469
Cut to the chase,
Clarke.

06:24.677 --> 06:26.054
You said we wanted
the same thing.

06:26.262 --> 06:27.680
I want an ice nation
commander.

06:27.889 --> 06:31.392
And I can give you
one with this.

06:31.601 --> 06:33.311
And why would you do
that when you know

06:33.519 --> 06:35.563
she's vowed
to wipe you out?

06:35.772 --> 06:38.107
We don't
have a choice.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.443
This isn't
just our war.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.528
The enemy
we're up against

06:42.737 --> 06:44.405
is after
everyone,

06:44.614 --> 06:46.491
including
the ice nation.

06:46.699 --> 06:47.784
The only way
to stop her

06:47.992 --> 06:48.993
is to get
the information

06:49.202 --> 06:51.037
off the flame,
and the only way

06:51.245 --> 06:53.414
to do that is to put
it in Ontari's head.

06:53.623 --> 06:55.375
The ice nation
isn't afraid.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.126
You should be.

06:57.335 --> 07:00.588
This thing doesn't care
what clan you're from.

07:00.797 --> 07:02.465
It controls people,

07:02.673 --> 07:04.759
and it will take over
the ice nation

07:04.967 --> 07:06.803
just like it
took us over,

07:07.011 --> 07:10.848
one person at a time
until there is no one left.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.231
It already has Ontari.

07:19.816 --> 07:21.901
I'm listening.

07:24.654 --> 07:27.657
We need to disconnect her
before she gets the flame,

07:27.865 --> 07:30.660
or we'll be giving Alie
exactly what she wants.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.620
To do that, we have to
abduct her from the center

07:32.829 --> 07:34.622
of a city filled
with thousands of people

07:34.831 --> 07:36.958
who's minds
are linked,

07:37.166 --> 07:39.919
all of them
thinking as one.

07:40.128 --> 07:41.712
Whatever one sees,
they all see.

07:41.921 --> 07:44.298
Whatever one hears,
they all hear.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.467
I get it.

07:53.099 --> 07:55.518
So when do we leave?

08:02.525 --> 08:05.361
Knockout gas, mount
weather's finest.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.780
As soon as they
bring Ontari out,

08:07.989 --> 08:09.157
we put them
to sleep.

08:09.365 --> 08:10.491
Nice.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.034
Because she's chipped,
you'll have to EMP her

08:12.243 --> 08:13.578
like you did me before
you give her the flame.

08:13.786 --> 08:16.038
I thought Jaha
destroyed all the wristbands.

08:16.247 --> 08:18.416
So did he.
Then I came home.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.126
There's only
enough usable parts

08:20.334 --> 08:21.961
to rebuild one,
so use it wisely.

08:23.087 --> 08:24.755
Made a few
improvements, too.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.591
None of which
is gonna matter

08:26.799 --> 08:28.968
if you can't get us
access to Alie's code.

08:31.304 --> 08:33.848
You worry about
the Nightblood.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.475
I'll worry
about Alie.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.851
How can you
access code

08:37.059 --> 08:39.020
that doesn't exist
here anymore?

08:39.228 --> 08:41.147
We've got a plan.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.901
What are
we waiting for?

08:46.360 --> 08:49.030
Let's move out.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.114
Be safe.

08:50.323 --> 08:52.241
May we meet again.

08:52.450 --> 08:53.576
Good luck.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.749
You got this.

09:21.354 --> 09:25.399
You were right.
They're using the king.

09:25.608 --> 09:28.069
Good.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.862
Then they'll bring
the flame right to us.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.574
And we'll
be waiting.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.254
There it is.
We stop here.

10:06.941 --> 10:08.568
All right. This is
where we split up.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.819
The entrance
to the tunnel

10:10.027 --> 10:10.945
is right over there.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.572
Yeah.
We know where it is.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.659
I'm gonna need
the flame.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.244
Look.
This only works

10:18.452 --> 10:19.954
if they send Ontari
out to get it.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.123
If they don't see it,
they won't do that,

10:22.331 --> 10:24.875
not much of a trap
without the bait.

10:33.593 --> 10:35.261
Fine...

10:36.804 --> 10:39.181
But I'm coming
with you.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.225
No way. That
is not the plan.

10:43.436 --> 10:45.313
It is now.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.526
I'm not letting that
out of my sight...

10:53.279 --> 10:56.574
And I'm the only one
who knows the passphrase,

10:56.782 --> 10:59.201
so you can tell them
that without me,

10:59.410 --> 11:01.621
Ontari can't ascend.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.127
You'll need to look
like my prisoner.

11:08.336 --> 11:10.296
OK.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.590
Wait a second.
Give us a minute.

11:20.348 --> 11:21.932
Come on, Clarke.

11:22.141 --> 11:24.268
You're really
willing to trust

11:24.477 --> 11:26.312
that guy
with your life?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.108
No...

11:33.569 --> 11:36.864
But you'll be covering
us the entire time,

11:37.073 --> 11:38.908
and I trust you.

11:41.243 --> 11:45.081
Pick a shelf.
Raven said it would be here.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.874
What are we
looking for again?

11:47.083 --> 11:49.460
A motherboard
loaded with ram.

11:49.669 --> 11:52.421
And that
looks like--

11:52.630 --> 11:55.675
a motherboard
loaded with ram.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.343
Raven said she needs
the processing power

11:57.551 --> 11:59.845
to open a portal
into Alie.

12:00.054 --> 12:00.971
Portal?

12:01.180 --> 12:02.473
That's what
she calls it.

12:02.682 --> 12:03.974
She wants to use one
of Alie's own chips

12:04.183 --> 12:05.393
to hack back in.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.228
All we have to do is
enter the kill code

12:07.436 --> 12:08.562
we get from the
flame once we put it

12:08.771 --> 12:09.897
in Ontari.

12:10.106 --> 12:11.148
It's game over.

12:11.357 --> 12:13.150
That old plan. Ha!

12:13.359 --> 12:16.070
What if it
doesn't work?

12:17.988 --> 12:19.865
It has to.

12:25.287 --> 12:28.499
So...You
and Harper, huh?

12:28.708 --> 12:30.751
Uh-huh.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.672
I'm happy for you.

12:36.132 --> 12:40.386
What, can't be happy
for my friend?

12:40.594 --> 12:43.305
You haven't been
happy about anything

12:43.514 --> 12:45.599
in a long time.

12:48.894 --> 12:53.065
You're right.
I haven't been.

12:57.528 --> 12:59.530
What happened
in mount weather

12:59.739 --> 13:02.408
changed me.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.327
I blamed everyone
for it--

13:05.536 --> 13:08.789
Clarke, you.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.503
I'm done blaming.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.894
I'm glad you're
back, brother.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.687
Me, too.

13:34.106 --> 13:37.485
Wait a second.
There it is.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.408
We can't let raven
build the portal.

13:47.953 --> 13:49.872
We did it.
Let's go.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.749
Huh! Uh...

13:51.957 --> 13:53.292
Give me that.

13:53.501 --> 13:54.960
Uh! Gah!

13:56.086 --> 13:57.421
Uhh...

13:58.839 --> 14:01.592
Jasper, we need
that motherboard.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.639
Raven! Raven,
open the door!

14:08.349 --> 14:10.684
What's wrong?

14:13.896 --> 14:15.272
Monty,
what is it?

14:15.481 --> 14:16.816
Japser's
been chipped.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.317
What?
Are you sure?

14:18.526 --> 14:19.902
He stabbed me.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.487
Oh, my God.

14:23.823 --> 14:26.867
If Jasper's been chipped,
then Alie knows everything.

14:27.076 --> 14:28.953
Radio.

14:30.663 --> 14:33.541
Rover one, come in.

14:33.749 --> 14:37.002
Damn it, Bellamy,
pick up.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.758
It's not transmitting.
It's not working.

14:42.967 --> 14:44.051
Uh!

14:48.430 --> 14:50.391
Let me in, Monty.

14:57.982 --> 14:59.650
They're walking
into a trap.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.997
Your friends better
be in position.

15:18.335 --> 15:22.047
Move, move, move.
Come on. Let's go.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.433
All right.
This way.

15:34.894 --> 15:36.270
This is it.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.232
Get these
grates open.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.234
When this is over,

15:42.443 --> 15:45.029
Ontari will know
you helped her.

15:45.237 --> 15:48.198
You have my word.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.913
Let's get ready.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.590
Are we ever gonna
be done fighting?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.800
Hell yes.

16:07.009 --> 16:10.763
We're gonna build
a house on a lake...

16:12.056 --> 16:15.100
And you're gonna
plant corn. Ha ha!

16:15.309 --> 16:17.770
And
raise chickens.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.105
Yeah...

16:21.857 --> 16:24.068
And grow old.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.699
11 o'clock.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.701
Roan will signal
when he sees Ontari.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.244
We wait until
she's standing

16:34.453 --> 16:35.704
in front of them,

16:35.913 --> 16:37.957
and then we
launch the gas.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.084
They're gonna be
holding their breath,

16:40.292 --> 16:42.378
so we got
to move fast.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.757
So much for
the thousands of people.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.513
Anyone who gets in our way,
we use nonlethal force.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.014
These people
are not the enemy.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.933
They're being
controlled.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.936
The only thing we're
here to kill is Alie.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.562
- Is that clear?
- Clear.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.731
- Clear.
- Good.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.113
Here we go.

17:23.168 --> 17:27.423
I am roan,
king of Azgeda...

17:29.842 --> 17:32.678
And I have what
the commander seeks.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.026
I don't like
what I'm sensing,

17:47.234 --> 17:50.362
so if she wants it,
she can come to me.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.844
It's Jaha.

18:14.053 --> 18:15.262
What the hell
is he doing here?

18:15.471 --> 18:18.932
- You see Ontari?
- No. Hold.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.268
Hello, Clarke.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.439
Your mother will be
so pleased to see you.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.983
Who are you?
Where's Ontari?

18:28.192 --> 18:30.360
Not coming out,

18:30.569 --> 18:32.279
but you can give
the flame to me.

18:32.488 --> 18:34.656
I'll be sure
she gets it.

18:39.078 --> 18:40.996
Something's wrong.

18:41.205 --> 18:44.124
Your friends in
the tunnel can't help you.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.960
Now give me
the flame.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.257
Back up,
or she dies.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.967
Do it.
Do it now.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.012
On your knees!
Drop your weapon!

18:57.221 --> 18:58.889
- Uh!
- Uh!

18:59.098 --> 19:00.349
Blake, against the wall.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.142
- Drop it.
- Turn around!

19:03.310 --> 19:04.812
Save
the theatrics.

19:05.020 --> 19:08.315
We know you're together.
We know everything.

19:08.524 --> 19:09.775
Then you know
she's the only one

19:09.983 --> 19:11.276
who can activate
the flame.

19:11.485 --> 19:12.694
Mmph...Mmph...

19:12.903 --> 19:16.031
You're right.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.535
We need her alive.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.703
Run.

19:23.372 --> 19:24.540
But we
don't need you.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.167
Uhh!

19:34.341 --> 19:37.344
Uh! Uh...

19:38.679 --> 19:40.264
Hey. No!

19:40.472 --> 19:43.100
No! Uh! No!

19:43.308 --> 19:44.476
Uh! No!

19:56.488 --> 19:58.532
You doing OK?

19:58.740 --> 20:01.201
I think so.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.120
If it hit
anything important,

20:03.328 --> 20:05.038
I wouldn't be,
right?

20:05.247 --> 20:08.000
Right.
You got lucky.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.044
We could use
some more of that.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.850
Harper's
out there alone.

20:25.058 --> 20:29.521
Harper's a guard and
a better shot than you.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.607
She doesn't know
Jasper's chipped.

20:31.815 --> 20:32.900
I know that, Monty.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.568
We can't risk Jasper
getting in here,

20:34.776 --> 20:36.320
not when Alie knows
what I'm building.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.071
Raven,
the plan failed.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.907
Clarke won't be radioing
with the kill code.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.783
I can find it
myself.

20:41.992 --> 20:44.661
If I can get this to work,
I can kill Alie.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.538
You tried this before.
It didn't work.

20:46.747 --> 20:49.458
I can do it.
I have to.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.128
Come on, guys.

20:53.337 --> 20:56.548
Let me in.
I just want to talk.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.967
As long as
he's right here,

20:59.176 --> 21:02.304
he's not looking
for Harper.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.488
So talk.

21:19.696 --> 21:24.409
You sound good.
I'm glad.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.995
I never want
to hurt you, Monty.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.917
I don't blame you.
You were tortured.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.878
You got it wrong.
I wasn't tortured.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.713
I mean, yeah,
I was punched

21:36.922 --> 21:38.382
a couple of times,
but that's not

21:38.590 --> 21:40.092
why I took the key.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.178
You should've seen
Luna’s rig, Monty.

21:43.387 --> 21:46.265
It was peaceful,
safe.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.809
The people
were happy.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.186
There was this girl
there, shay.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.272
When I was talking
to her, I realized

21:53.480 --> 21:55.232
for the first time
since mount weather,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.943
I wasn't thinking
about Maya.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.487
It was beautiful there,
and we destroyed it.

22:00.696 --> 22:04.283
That wasn't us.
It was Alie.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.868
It doesn't matter.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.581
What matters
is that Alie

22:11.790 --> 22:14.918
can take away
all that pain.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.047
She can do
the same for you.

22:20.841 --> 22:24.219
Please open the door.

22:24.428 --> 22:27.139
Don't let raven ruin
this for all of us.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.605
How could you
do that to us?

22:35.814 --> 22:37.357
I realized
the truth.

22:37.566 --> 22:38.900
They sent us all
down here

22:39.109 --> 22:41.737
to see if the ground
was survivable.

22:41.945 --> 22:45.282
From what I've seen,
it's not.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.593
Mmph! Let me go.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.554
You'll be free
soon enough.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.640
Uh...Uh...

23:17.814 --> 23:19.024
Clarke...

23:21.485 --> 23:23.737
I've missed you.

23:27.324 --> 23:30.744
I won't take
the chip ever.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.288
Right now,

23:33.497 --> 23:35.749
we just need your
help with the flame.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.293
What's the
passphrase, Clarke?

23:40.379 --> 23:42.881
Stubborn
like her mother.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.429
Hey. Hey.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.223
Uh! Let me go!

23:51.431 --> 23:52.724
Rrgh!

23:52.933 --> 23:54.142
Uhh...

23:54.351 --> 23:55.394
Mom...

23:55.602 --> 23:59.147
Mom, please don't
let them do this.

23:59.356 --> 24:01.149
I'm not letting
them do this.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.443
I'm doing it.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.533
Uh...

24:12.119 --> 24:15.163
Uh! Uh!

24:35.767 --> 24:38.562
What's the
passphrase, Clarke?

24:47.446 --> 24:48.780
Aah!

24:52.826 --> 24:55.203
Mom, this isn't you.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.664
I know
you're in there.

25:02.294 --> 25:04.421
Please.

25:04.629 --> 25:07.215
What's the
passphrase?

25:16.349 --> 25:19.102
No! Aah!

25:19.311 --> 25:21.188
Aah! Aah!

25:28.111 --> 25:30.489
It can stop,
Clarke.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.283
Just tell us what
we need to know.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.001
I told you.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.378
Her friends
are her weakness.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.263
Start with
Bellamy Blake.

26:06.399 --> 26:07.984
Huh. Huh! Huh!

26:11.655 --> 26:14.366
Let's go.
She wants Bellamy.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.785
Uh! Uh!

26:16.993 --> 26:18.787
Where are you
taking him?

26:18.995 --> 26:19.871
Uh! Ugh!

26:20.080 --> 26:23.542
O. It's OK, o.
It's OK.

26:26.211 --> 26:28.171
You know, if I were you,
I'd hit the deck.

26:30.048 --> 26:34.761
Murphy?
Everyone hit the ground! Uh!

26:41.977 --> 26:44.437
Fancy meeting
you here.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.274
More will come.
We have to hurry.

26:49.192 --> 26:51.319
You OK?

26:55.699 --> 26:57.993
Thank you.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.078
What are you
doing here?

27:00.287 --> 27:02.747
You're welcome.

27:04.207 --> 27:09.129
Nathan, you've
looked better.

27:09.337 --> 27:12.090
You haven't.
Uh...Ahh.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.051
All right.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.097
You're with pike?

27:19.306 --> 27:22.183
Only way we get
out of here is together.

27:22.392 --> 27:25.020
He killed Lincoln--

27:25.228 --> 27:28.148
put him on his knees,

27:28.356 --> 27:30.692
shot him
in the head.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.653
O., Indra’s right.

27:33.862 --> 27:36.031
We need every
fighter we can get.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.867
You guys missed the part
where it's time to go?

27:39.075 --> 27:41.786
We're not leaving.

27:41.995 --> 27:43.538
We just saved
your lives.

27:43.747 --> 27:45.582
Why do I think I'm
gonna regret that?

27:45.790 --> 27:46.958
Clarke is in trouble.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.668
Clarke's always
in trouble.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.920
They took her and
the flame to the tower.

27:51.129 --> 27:54.049
It's a safe bet
Ontari's there, too.

27:54.257 --> 27:58.678
Everything we need to stop
Alie is in the same place.

27:58.887 --> 28:00.013
If we go
up that tower,

28:00.221 --> 28:02.849
we won't be able to
fight our way out again.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.976
If we stop Alie,

28:05.185 --> 28:07.604
we won't have to.

28:19.157 --> 28:21.701
Up the tower. Great.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.456
You know, after this
doing the right thing

28:26.665 --> 28:28.708
can kiss my ass.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.182
Ohh...

28:56.778 --> 28:57.570
Oh!

28:57.779 --> 28:58.571
Agh!

28:58.780 --> 28:59.698
Hey! I told you,

28:59.906 --> 29:00.907
that is not how
we're doing this.

29:01.116 --> 29:02.242
They were
in our way.

29:02.450 --> 29:03.660
These people are
not our enemy.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.036
They're being
controlled by Alie,

29:05.245 --> 29:06.996
and we can save them.

29:07.205 --> 29:07.997
There's gonna be
a lot more of these people

29:08.206 --> 29:08.998
if we don't move.

29:09.207 --> 29:09.999
Let's do this.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.168
I'll bring it
down.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.173
Once we're up, you blow
the elevator and then climb.

29:17.382 --> 29:20.427
Destroy the ladder
behind us. On it.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.762
Come on. You do realize we
don't have a way down, right?

29:22.971 --> 29:24.514
A problem
for another day.

29:24.723 --> 29:27.183
Let's go.
Our ride's here.

29:28.309 --> 29:31.396
Mm...Nngh!

29:37.277 --> 29:39.279
Coming, o.?

29:39.487 --> 29:41.197
If anything
goes wrong down here,

29:41.406 --> 29:42.907
they'll need
my help.

29:43.116 --> 29:44.951
We got this.

29:53.501 --> 29:55.503
Push.

29:56.921 --> 29:58.631
Push.

30:03.678 --> 30:06.055
You get that we're
screwed, right?

30:06.264 --> 30:09.517
Alie already knows
that we're coming.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.563
This plan will work.

30:18.693 --> 30:21.321
Why are you here?

30:21.529 --> 30:23.948
I'm just trying
to survive.

30:27.118 --> 30:29.037
You're not
the only one here

30:29.245 --> 30:31.372
trying to save someone
you care about.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.005
Uh!

30:39.214 --> 30:41.549
Uh!

30:43.635 --> 30:46.971
Push! Ah!

30:49.682 --> 30:50.683
Ugh...

30:50.892 --> 30:53.269
Why are you looking
at me like that?

30:53.478 --> 30:56.064
Because I know what
you're thinking.

31:02.946 --> 31:05.448
Why is he
still alive?

31:05.657 --> 31:08.952
Because the dead
can't help us.

31:12.163 --> 31:14.415
He was my home.

31:24.008 --> 31:25.051
- Ah!
- Uh!

31:27.971 --> 31:28.805
Uh...

31:29.013 --> 31:30.390
Well, that's
not good.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.060
Nate!

31:36.855 --> 31:38.940
This isn't you, Kane.
I'm sorry.

31:39.148 --> 31:40.149
Uh!

31:43.027 --> 31:44.863
They're coming in.

31:47.866 --> 31:50.535
He won't be alone.
We have to hurry.

31:50.743 --> 31:53.246
Bryan,
you all right?

31:55.999 --> 31:58.167
Murphy, get
that Baton ready.

31:59.419 --> 32:00.962
Shock him, Murphy!

32:03.464 --> 32:05.842
Yaah!

32:06.050 --> 32:07.302
Murphy!

32:07.510 --> 32:09.387
Aah!

32:09.596 --> 32:11.598
Yah!

32:15.184 --> 32:16.769
Back on the wheel.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.732
We're about
to have company.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.692
You want to bet?

32:22.901 --> 32:24.903
We need to seal
the corridor.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.696
Nate...

32:27.822 --> 32:29.407
Uhh! Uh!

32:32.201 --> 32:33.286
Oh!

32:35.455 --> 32:37.373
Take cover!

32:37.582 --> 32:38.625
Uh!

32:38.833 --> 32:40.501
Come on, Murphy!

32:44.255 --> 32:46.758
Huh...Ah!

32:46.966 --> 32:48.426
- Uh!
- Agh!

32:50.178 --> 32:51.137
Yah!

32:54.474 --> 32:56.601
Ugh...

32:57.727 --> 32:59.354
Agh! Agh!

32:59.562 --> 33:01.481
Uh!

33:11.032 --> 33:14.369
Shoot him!
Shoot him! Bellamy!

33:26.089 --> 33:28.299
Thank you.

33:33.638 --> 33:36.474
Her friends are resourceful.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.519
We'll have to improvise.

33:44.273 --> 33:47.318
John Mbege--sliced throat,

33:47.527 --> 33:49.362
Roma Bragg--
spear to the chest,

33:49.570 --> 33:52.156
not as lucky as me...

33:53.992 --> 33:57.370
Finn Collins--
death by Clarke,

33:57.578 --> 34:00.456
Dax--death by Clarke,
atom--

34:00.665 --> 34:02.041
this should do it.

34:02.250 --> 34:06.504
Acid fog,
then death by Clarke...

34:08.172 --> 34:09.173
Trina and Pascal--

34:10.550 --> 34:11.884
gone.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.887
Yes! Ah!

34:15.096 --> 34:16.180
Ha!

34:16.389 --> 34:18.850
You're in.
It worked.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.309
We still have to get
the kill switch

34:20.518 --> 34:21.853
without Alie
finding us.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.396
Connor and Myles--
choked on plastic,

34:23.604 --> 34:24.647
thanks to Murphy.

34:24.856 --> 34:27.066
Drew--ninja star
to the face.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.276
That was a good one.

34:37.535 --> 34:39.620
Why'd you guys
lock the door?

34:42.582 --> 34:44.834
Harper, do you
see Jasper?

34:49.422 --> 34:51.382
Harper!

34:51.591 --> 34:52.508
Don't.

35:00.224 --> 35:02.977
Jasper, if you
hurt her--

35:03.186 --> 35:05.897
I know you care
about her.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.232
All you have to do is
destroy the machine,

35:08.441 --> 35:11.778
and she'll be fine,
promise.

35:15.323 --> 35:19.243
I don't want you
to lose anyone else.

35:31.464 --> 35:32.673
Nngh!

35:32.882 --> 35:36.803
They've got to be almost there.
Keep pushing.

35:43.726 --> 35:45.561
They're coming.

36:04.622 --> 36:08.334
Don't be afraid.
It's not for you.

36:21.889 --> 36:22.974
No.

36:23.182 --> 36:26.269
Mom, mom, stop.
Listen to me.

36:26.477 --> 36:28.271
I know you can hear me.
Just stop.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.565
You know how
to stop this.

36:33.526 --> 36:36.696
Wait, Alie.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.282
If you kill her,
you'll never get what you want.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.367
Alie's
not killing me.

36:41.576 --> 36:43.452
You are.

36:44.954 --> 36:49.000
Mom, don't do this,
please.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.628
I'm begging you,
don't do it.

36:55.715 --> 36:56.799
Please.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.720
What's the
passphrase, Clarke?

37:03.848 --> 37:06.934
I can't.
I can't.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.024
She'll break.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.443
Do it.

37:15.651 --> 37:18.404
No.

37:18.613 --> 37:19.405
Huh! Agh...

37:19.614 --> 37:23.159
No! No.

37:23.367 --> 37:25.953
No!

37:26.162 --> 37:27.622
Uh! Agh...

37:27.830 --> 37:30.082
Ah!

37:30.291 --> 37:33.544
I'm so sorry.

37:33.753 --> 37:35.338
They're
at the top.

37:35.546 --> 37:38.883
Let's go.
We set the bomb and fly.

37:39.091 --> 37:41.135
- 30 seconds.
- Let's go.

37:49.352 --> 37:52.063
The timer's set.
Let's move.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.576
Ohh...

38:07.703 --> 38:09.664
Indra.

38:09.872 --> 38:11.707
Kane, get back!

38:13.209 --> 38:14.377
Ach!

38:14.585 --> 38:15.795
Indra!

38:36.816 --> 38:38.651
They're here.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.319
We can't let them
have you.

38:40.528 --> 38:41.779
I understand.

38:47.743 --> 38:50.997
What are you doing?
Wait. Stop.

38:53.791 --> 38:55.459
Jaha, don't do this.

38:56.627 --> 38:58.671
Throne room's
this way.

39:00.923 --> 39:04.051
Alie, stop it.
Please don't do this.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.721
No!

39:08.389 --> 39:10.933
Damage to her
brain is substantial,

39:11.142 --> 39:12.852
but she's still alive.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.815
Bellamy, stop him!

39:19.275 --> 39:20.109
Oh!

39:22.820 --> 39:23.904
Uh!

39:25.364 --> 39:26.991
Uh!

39:27.199 --> 39:29.535
Hey,
are you OK?

39:29.744 --> 39:31.037
Is she alive?
Is she breathing?

39:31.245 --> 39:33.456
It's OK.
She's breathing.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.960
Jaha has the flame.
Get it.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.546
We can't
let Ontari die.

39:40.755 --> 39:42.631
We have to stop
the bleeding.

39:44.717 --> 39:46.260
- I got the flame.
- Her pulse is weak.

39:46.469 --> 39:50.306
- At least she's alive.
- Here. Hold this to the wound.

39:50.514 --> 39:51.807
Come on.
What are you gonna do?

39:52.016 --> 39:53.434
I need
a flashlight.

39:53.642 --> 39:56.687
First, we take out the chip.
Then we put in the flame.

39:58.773 --> 40:01.525
Her pupils
are unresponsive.

40:03.861 --> 40:07.239
What? What
does that mean?

40:07.448 --> 40:11.535
She's brain dead.
She can't give us the kill code.

40:14.163 --> 40:16.290
It's over.

40:19.377 --> 40:22.046
We're trapped here.
