00:01.102 --> 00:01.335
.

00:01.369 --> 00:02.270
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:02.903 --> 00:03.904
sexually based offenses

00:03.937 --> 00:06.507
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.077
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.110 --> 00:10.611
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.644 --> 00:12.313
are members of an elite squad

00:12.346 --> 00:14.248
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.084
These are their stories.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.388
- I got to tell you,
this food is fantastic.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.291
Mmm.

00:23.324 --> 00:27.461
Korean/Mexican fusion.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.130
- I live three blocks
from this place.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.165
I never knew it existed.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.102
- Takes time to explore.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.104
- Exactly.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.438
- Something wrong?

00:37.471 --> 00:39.640
- No.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.076
Just the opposite.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.412
Everything is just right.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.214
I'm healthy.
Uh...

00:46.247 --> 00:49.150
Reasonably sane.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.820
And I'm having dinner with
an amazing, beautiful woman.

00:52.853 --> 00:56.324
- But?

00:56.357 --> 01:00.461
- I think I might
put the shield down.

01:00.494 --> 01:04.132
- You're gonna retire?

01:04.165 --> 01:06.334
To do what?
- To do nothing.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.569
To smell the damn flowers.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.238
Hopefully,
with somebody like you.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.573
[cell phone buzzes]

01:12.606 --> 01:16.277
I've been doing this a long time
and at a certain point,

01:16.310 --> 01:18.446
you know,
enough is enough.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.648
This job will swallow you whole,
if you let it.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.316
- So don't let it.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.853
*

01:25.886 --> 01:30.224
- You're saying you're
not ready, is that it?

01:30.258 --> 01:34.528
- I'm saying that...

01:34.562 --> 01:37.331
I just had a great dinner

01:37.365 --> 01:39.333
with a great man.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.668
- Now you're deflecting.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.405
- Maybe.

01:46.507 --> 01:50.544
We both know that this
hasn't been quite as easy

01:50.578 --> 01:53.647
as we both thought
it would be.

01:53.681 --> 01:57.351
- I know.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.587
But be honest, Liv.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.590
What does the future hold
for you?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.458
For us?

02:04.492 --> 02:09.630
*

02:09.663 --> 02:11.899
- Listen, this company screams
"takeover."

02:11.932 --> 02:13.367
It's trendy, relevant,

02:13.401 --> 02:15.636
the marketing is youthful
and current.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.938
I think Smith'll jump at this.
- Really?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.907
Because they make
organic craft ale

02:19.940 --> 02:21.409
that young people
overpay for?

02:21.442 --> 02:23.511
- No, because our client
needs to rebrand.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.379
Being venerable
is a curse these days.

02:25.413 --> 02:29.417
That stock, it's trading at
a 20% discount to its peers.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.718
- I agree.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.520
Smith needs to pivot fast.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.955
They can't keep focusing on
carbonated soft drinks.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.691
Buying Hollow Artisan Ale
would be their industry pivot.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.693
- Please stop saying "pivot."

02:39.727 --> 02:42.196
We get it, Brad.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.931
I appreciate what you guys
are going for,

02:43.964 --> 02:46.700
but I don't like it.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.269
- Okay.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.738
What's your plan?

02:50.771 --> 02:53.374
- Changing who you are,
who you really are,

02:53.407 --> 02:57.478
is almost impossible,
so let's embrace the venerable

02:57.511 --> 02:59.580
and double down
on who they already are.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.415
- Well,
that's either brilliant,

03:01.449 --> 03:04.418
or we're all getting fired
tomorrow morning.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.954
- You sent her flowers
and you never even met?

03:06.987 --> 03:08.689
- No, we saw each other
from across the room,

03:08.722 --> 03:11.359
I waved--
it's called being bold.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.393
- Or scary.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.594
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.363
So--so being romantic is scary?
- Depends.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.764
- On what?

03:16.797 --> 03:20.568
- On whether or not
she thinks you're cute.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.708
- What is it?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.377
- Nothing.

03:29.410 --> 03:33.481
Um, I thought I saw someone
that I knew.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.648
[chuckles]

03:34.682 --> 03:35.749
Nate.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.718
One more round
for everyone.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.253
- Same thing?
- Mm-hmm.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.288
- Got ya.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.576
- Sorry about
the late call, Liv.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.411
- It's okay.
What do we got?

04:37.445 --> 04:39.880
- Vic's name is Quinn Berris.
She's 27,

04:39.913 --> 04:41.649
lives alone, single.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.418
She called 911 at 11:25.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.654
She says a guy in a mask
jumped her,

04:46.687 --> 04:48.322
pushed her into
her apartment,

04:48.356 --> 04:50.424
and sexually assaulted her
at knifepoint.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.059
- Okay, let's track down
surveillance footage

04:52.092 --> 04:53.661
and talk to all
these neighbors.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.596
- I'm already on it.
- Good.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.533
- It's okay.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.404
- Thank you.
- No problem.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.373
- Quinn,
I'm Lieutenant Benson,

05:05.406 --> 05:07.675
and this is
Detective Tutuola.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.711
We're from
the Special Victims Unit.

05:10.744 --> 05:14.314
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

05:18.419 --> 05:23.691
I understand the man
who did this wore a mask.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.460
- Yes, it was a black mask.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.562
*

05:28.596 --> 05:30.598
- Was he short or tall?

05:30.631 --> 05:35.369
*

05:35.403 --> 05:37.671
- Medium height,
medium build.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.441
- Could you tell if
he was black or white?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.410
- No.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.912
But it doesn't really matter.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.515
- What do you mean?

05:47.548 --> 05:49.617
- I think I know
who did this.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.656
His name is Ray Wilson.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.692
And he's been stalking me
since college.

05:58.726 --> 06:03.797
*

06:05.899 --> 06:08.869
[dramatic music]

06:08.902 --> 06:15.909
*

06:53.914 --> 06:57.117
I'd like you to tell me more
about Ray Wilson.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.854
- We met at college.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.456
At Rutgers.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.558
We went on one date.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.793
I just wasn't interested

07:05.826 --> 07:08.529
and he wouldn't
leave me alone.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.831
He just kept texting me
and following me,

07:10.864 --> 07:12.700
and he started leaving
notes on my car

07:12.733 --> 07:14.502
and buying me gifts,

07:14.535 --> 07:18.639
and he even followed me
to my parents' house once.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.207
- Did you get
a restraining order?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.109
- Yes, of course.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.945
But he didn't care.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.247
And then one day after class,

07:27.280 --> 07:30.484
he was in my closet.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.719
- Did he assault you?

07:31.752 --> 07:34.187
- No, I threw
my coffee at him

07:34.221 --> 07:37.558
and ran to the bathroom,
locked the door, and called 911.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.960
The police came
five minutes later.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.962
- He go to prison?

07:41.995 --> 07:45.165
- Yes--he got out
on parole last year.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.967
Moved back to Paterson.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.571
- Okay, and did he ever
contact you again?

07:50.604 --> 07:54.608
- Yeah, he--
he sent a letter of apology...

07:54.642 --> 07:56.143
to my office.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.979
And it made me nervous,
so I called Sergeant Cole.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.781
- Sergeant Cole?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.883
- He's the officer
that saved me that night.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.618
- Okay.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.620
And are you two
still in touch?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.722
- Yeah, we sort of
became friends.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.692
I knew his daughter,
we went to college together.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.160
He's retired now, anyway.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.928
I asked him to make sure
that Ray wasn't

08:14.962 --> 08:17.731
still obsessed with me.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.200
I should've called NYPD--

08:20.233 --> 08:23.003
- The only thing that you need
to worry about is you.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.773
Okay?

08:25.806 --> 08:28.609
You're gonna be okay, Quinn.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.277
You're gonna
get through this.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.614
*

08:33.647 --> 08:35.315
- Ray Wilson.
He's 27.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.618
He was convicted four years ago
of breaking and entering

08:37.651 --> 08:39.186
and attempted sexual assault.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.888
Now, he was paroled in October.
- Okay, any other priors?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.255
- No, that's it.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.824
- Just talked to Quinn's
neighbors.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.627
Nobody saw or heard anything.
- Surveillance?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.596
- Still looking,
but so far, nothing.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.564
- Rape kit?
- No semen, no DNA.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.932
But the perp
definitely used a condom.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.635
They found a ripped packet
underneath her bed.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.303
They're running that
for prints and DNA now.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.205
- Yeah, so far, the only
forensic evidence we have

08:58.238 --> 08:59.940
is a fresh cigarette butt--
it was found on the courtyard

08:59.973 --> 09:00.941
in front of Quinn's door.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.009
- Well, hopefully the lab

09:02.042 --> 09:03.644
will come up with some DNA.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.813
Otherwise, we got
a whole lot of nothing.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.347
- Except Ray Wilson,
of course.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.349
- You want us to track him down?
- Uh, no.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.251
Let's talk to this
Sergeant Cole first.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.621
The more we know about
Ray Wilson beforehand,

09:13.654 --> 09:15.355
the better.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.224
Let's take a ride to Jersey.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.063
[children yelling]

09:23.096 --> 09:24.364
- Oh, yeah!

09:24.397 --> 09:26.333
Uh-oh!
Now you can't stop me.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.368
Look out!
Oh, my good--

09:28.401 --> 09:32.372
[children laughing and yelling]

09:32.405 --> 09:35.342
- Who's winning?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.611
- Youth.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.081
You must be Lieutenant Benson.
- I am.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.751
And this is Detective Carisi.
- Tom Cole.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.985
- Hey, nice place
you got here.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.254
- Thanks.
My wife does everything.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.089
I just grill the steaks.
- Mm-hmm.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.291
- Let's get some privacy.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.061
Have a seat.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.963
- I'll leave you folks
to talk shop.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.765
Are you sure I can't
get you guys something?

09:57.798 --> 10:00.067
Coffee or tea...
- Oh, we're fine, thank you.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.770
- Uh, Linda.
- Linda.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.007
- I talked to Quinn
a few hours ago.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.643
- Oh.
She called you.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.979
- Yeah, she's devastated
and terrified.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.414
She's convinced Ray Wilson
did this.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.349
- I understand.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.086
So you and Quinn
are pretty close.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.088
- My wife and I,
we sort of took her in.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.824
- She said that you spoke to
Ray Wilson recently.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.293
- Yeah, after he sent
that letter last month,

10:26.326 --> 10:27.895
Quinn got nervous.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.763
She was afraid he'd start
stalking her again,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.364
so I paid him a visit.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.333
Reintroduced myself,
you know what I mean.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.435
- And how'd that go?
- Okay.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.070
Considering how
screwed up he is.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.673
He's clearly still
obsessed with Quinn.

10:39.707 --> 10:42.676
So I gave him a little tutorial
on how parole works--

10:42.710 --> 10:44.444
reminded him he's not allowed
to contact her,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.914
or live within 35 miles of her,
for that matter.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.816
- All right, what about work?
- Different story.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.450
He can make a living
wherever he wants.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.086
Right now, he's a chef at some
French place in the city

10:53.120 --> 10:55.155
about 20 blocks from
Quinn's apartment.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.724
Nothing we can do about it,
either.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.158
- You know the name
of this restaurant?

10:58.191 --> 11:01.128
- Lafayette, I think.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.064
- And if you can think
of anything else...

11:04.097 --> 11:06.399
please give us a call
anytime.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.434
[knocking]

11:07.467 --> 11:09.703
- I'll be there in a sec.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.107
- So, retirement...

11:14.141 --> 11:15.909
how's that feel?

11:15.943 --> 11:17.978
- Like I should've
done it years ago.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.086
- So he works at a restaurant
called Lafayette Grand Cafe.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.388
It's on Lafayette
and Great Jones.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.457
So grab Fin and get over there
and talk to him

11:30.490 --> 11:32.025
as soon as you can, okay?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.194
Thanks, Rollins.

11:35.829 --> 11:39.132
[sighs]

11:39.166 --> 11:41.769
- Everything okay?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.837
Yeah, just, uh...

11:43.871 --> 11:44.872
just thinking.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.740
- Yeah, what about?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.441
- About the next chapter.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.410
- And?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.746
- And that's the end of
this conversation.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.886
- Come on, come on,
let's go.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.089
Let's pick it up, guys,
we got 120 covers tonight.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.924
- Ray Wilson.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.759
- Can I help you?
- I'm Detective Rollins.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.994
This is Detective Tutuola.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.898
- We want to talk to you
about Quinn Berris.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.866
- Can we go somewhere else?

12:17.871 --> 12:18.671
What's this all about?

12:18.705 --> 12:19.672
Why are you asking me
about Quinn?

12:19.706 --> 12:20.941
- We just want to know
where you were last night.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.109
- Why do you want to know?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.811
- Why don't you let us
ask the questions?

12:23.844 --> 12:26.013
It works better that way.
- For you, maybe.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.414
- You want to go down
to the precinct?

12:27.447 --> 12:28.816
Do this in a more
formal setting,

12:28.849 --> 12:30.818
like our interrogation room?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.886
- Fine, uh...

12:32.920 --> 12:34.521
I was in Belmar.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.189
- What were you doing
down there?

12:36.223 --> 12:38.892
- Praying.
- Excuse me?

12:38.926 --> 12:40.493
- That's where
my church group is.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.795
- Church group?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.496
- Look, did something
happen to Quinn?

12:43.530 --> 12:44.998
- What time did you
leave the church?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.033
- I'm not talking about
any of this

12:46.066 --> 12:47.801
until you tell me
what happened.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.270
- She was assaulted.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.172
- And you think I did it?

12:52.205 --> 12:55.142
No, you're crazy--I was
in church from 7:00 to--

12:55.175 --> 12:57.110
- Until?
- 10:30 or so.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.146
- That's a lot of praying, Ray.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.181
- Yeah, well, I didn't think
there was a time limit.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.183
- We're gonna need the names
of all the men and women

13:03.216 --> 13:04.952
you were there with, okay?

13:07.087 --> 13:10.090
- "Let us walk honestly,
as in the day,

13:10.123 --> 13:12.592
"not in rioting and drunkenness,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.062
"not in chambering
and wantonness,

13:15.095 --> 13:17.197
not in strife and envying."

13:17.230 --> 13:20.934
- So is that a yes, you were
with Ray Wilson last night?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.135
- Correct.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.971
Ray and I discussed
the meaning

13:24.004 --> 13:25.172
and nuances of that passage.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.473
Romans 13:13.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.875
- And when did
the meeting begin?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.944
- 7:00.
- When did it end?

13:30.978 --> 13:32.980
- We were here,
deep into the night,

13:33.013 --> 13:35.248
talking and celebrating
the power of Christ.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.583
- That's great.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.151
But I need to know
what time the meeting

13:38.185 --> 13:41.021
was actually over--
was it 9:00, 10:00?

13:41.054 --> 13:44.224
- There's no way Ray could have
committed this heinous act.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.327
- Why's that?
- Because he's a good person.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.629
His light is beginning
to shine bright.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.564
We're all very
proud of him.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.200
- I'm glad to hear that,
but I need to know

13:53.233 --> 13:54.634
what time that meeting ended.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.904
- You should join us one night,
Detective.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.907
Never too late to rejoice
in the bliss of our Savior.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.875
- I'm good,
but please tell me what time

14:01.909 --> 14:03.977
the damn meeting ended.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.979
- Hey, any luck with
the surveillance footage

14:06.013 --> 14:07.147
near Quinn's apartment?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.983
- No, not yet.
- So keep searching.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.052
Send more unis down to
the scene.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.121
Have 'em canvass
the neighborhood,

14:14.154 --> 14:17.057
show them photos of Ray,
you know, maybe he's...

14:17.090 --> 14:18.525
hanging around.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.260
Watching, waiting.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.162
- You really think it's him?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.932
- Sometimes the answer
is as simple as it seems.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.900
Right?
Occam's Razor.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.169
- Or maybe he actually did
find God in the can

14:29.202 --> 14:32.139
and he worked all that dark,
ugly stuff out of his system.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.541
- It's possible, but prison
usually changes you

14:34.574 --> 14:37.210
for the worse, not the better,
unfortunately.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.946
- Like being a cop.

14:38.979 --> 14:43.283
*

14:43.316 --> 14:47.687
- Who are you, and what
have you done with Carisi?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.656
You really feel that way?

14:49.689 --> 14:52.025
- Talk to me in 20 years.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.928
- I will.

14:54.962 --> 14:58.165
And you'll realize that...

14:58.198 --> 15:00.700
the job doesn't change you,

15:00.733 --> 15:03.303
it makes you more of
who you already are.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.173
- So listen to this--
Ray Wilson's telling the truth.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.976
- Dude was really praying.
- And cleaning.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.078
There's video of him doing
dishes in a church kitchen

15:11.111 --> 15:12.612
at 10:50 p.m.,

15:12.645 --> 15:15.182
so even if he left at 10:51
and drove like a madman,

15:15.215 --> 15:16.716
he still wouldn't have made
Manhattan until midnight

15:16.749 --> 15:18.051
at the earliest.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.127
- You're saying that Ray wasn't
the one who did that to me?

15:29.629 --> 15:32.065
- We have strong evidence
that suggests

15:32.099 --> 15:34.501
that he was in New Jersey
at the time of the assault.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.469
- But if it wasn't Ray,
then who was it?

15:36.503 --> 15:37.604
- Well, we don't know yet,

15:37.637 --> 15:40.140
but we're gonna find them.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.475
- I hope you do.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.244
- Okay, um...

15:44.277 --> 15:45.712
Let's talk about
what happened beforehand.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.615
Now, you said that you were
at work, late.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.517
And then you went to
a bar, right?

15:50.550 --> 15:53.086
Now, do you remember anything
unusual happening there?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.522
Anybody staring at you
or watching you?

15:55.555 --> 15:58.625
- There was this one guy,
he was staring at me.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.594
For a second,
I thought it was Ray,

16:01.628 --> 16:05.298
but it wasn't, it just kind of
looked like him.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.534
Look...

16:07.567 --> 16:12.172
definitely a little paranoid.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.108
- Okay.
- A lot paranoid ever since...

16:15.142 --> 16:18.245
- It's okay.
It's completely normal.

16:18.278 --> 16:21.481
I understand.

16:21.514 --> 16:25.552
Take a breath.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.520
So when we first met,

16:27.554 --> 16:31.424
you said that Ray Wilson had
been stalking you for years.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.726
*

16:33.760 --> 16:35.662
- Yes.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.399
I guess--that was a bit of
an exaggeration.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.568
Um, I just...

16:41.601 --> 16:45.405
this past month, ever since
Ray moved back to New Jersey,

16:45.438 --> 16:48.675
I just felt like someone's
been watching me.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.411
- Did you ever seen anybody
actually watching you?

16:51.444 --> 16:54.414
- No.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.648
It's...

16:55.682 --> 16:58.651
it's just this feeling.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.421
And...

17:01.454 --> 17:04.424
you just get a sense
that there's

17:04.457 --> 17:05.725
this dark energy focused

17:05.758 --> 17:09.562
in your direction.

17:09.596 --> 17:13.366
This guy I was dating,
he saw someone once.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.370
Staring at my apartment, um,
early one morning.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.506
And then, later that day,
he saw the same guy

17:19.539 --> 17:21.508
staring at my apartment
right across the street.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.575
- When was this?

17:22.609 --> 17:24.377
- About three weeks ago.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.279
- Did he get
a good look at the guy?

17:26.313 --> 17:30.183
- No, he just said that he was
white and about my age,

17:30.217 --> 17:32.719
and I just assumed
that it was Ray.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.821
- Okay, what's his name,
your ex?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.723
- Jack Price.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.192
- We'll also need the name
of the bar you were at

17:39.226 --> 17:40.193
the night of your assault.

17:40.227 --> 17:47.200
*

17:47.234 --> 17:48.401
- Yeah, it's Quinn.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.702
She comes here all the time.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.338
Yeah, she works at
the consulting firm

17:51.371 --> 17:52.539
across the street,
Chatterton.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.374
- Mm-hmm, well,
she was here two nights ago.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.209
You remember seeing her?
- Yeah.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.610
Yeah, she was with
some coworkers.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.312
- Did you notice
anybody watching her,

17:59.346 --> 18:00.613
staring at her?

18:00.647 --> 18:03.350
- Everybody stares at Quinn.
She's beautiful.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.852
And has this really honest, uh,
intense energy, she's--

18:05.885 --> 18:07.620
- You're starting to
worry me here, Nate.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.489
- I'm just saying,
she's pretty amazing.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.358
But no,
I didn't notice anybody

18:11.391 --> 18:13.693
stalking her or acting weird.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.695
But she did get into
a pretty intense argument

18:15.728 --> 18:16.696
with her work buddy.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.498
- How you know that?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.633
- 'Cause he smashed
a beer bottle on the floor.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.369
I had to kick him out.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.371
- You know his name?

18:24.404 --> 18:26.373
- I--it was nothing,
we were just arguing about

18:26.406 --> 18:28.341
whether or not our client
should get more in touch

18:28.375 --> 18:29.642
with the millennial movement.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.444
- It's a movement now?
- [chuckles]

18:31.478 --> 18:32.879
Well, it's not my fault
if people my age

18:32.912 --> 18:34.614
are open to disruptive ideas.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.583
- Congratulations,
you're a disrupter.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.817
What we want to know is

18:37.850 --> 18:41.288
what happened after you
left the bar.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.489
- Hey, look,
Quinn and I have been

18:42.522 --> 18:43.823
working together
for four years.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.459
We're--we like each other,
we respect each other,

18:46.493 --> 18:48.428
we're friends--
we're good friends.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.630
You know, she called me
the day after all this happened.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.332
I told her to come stay
at my apartment.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.800
- That wasn't the question.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.868
- What we want to know is,
where did you go

18:55.902 --> 18:57.670
after you left the bar?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.539
- [chuckles]
What, seriously?

18:59.572 --> 19:01.308
You're doing the whole
"alibi" thing?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.376
- We look pretty serious,
right?

19:03.410 --> 19:05.745
So take your time, walk us
through every detail.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.714
- [scoffs]
Okay.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.716
- Did I ever see a stalker
near Quinn's apartment?

19:09.749 --> 19:12.519
Why? What's going on,
is she okay?

19:12.552 --> 19:14.654
- She's fine, we're just
following up on a complaint.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.689
- And Quinn told us you saw
someone standing

19:16.723 --> 19:18.491
across from her apartment
in the morning,

19:18.525 --> 19:19.726
and then again
that same night.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.860
- I did.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.595
- Yeah, did you see
what he looked like?

19:22.629 --> 19:24.431
- Yes.
- How close did you get?

19:24.464 --> 19:25.832
- Very.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.301
I, uh, confronted him.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.936
Said, "What's your deal, dude?
Why are you here?"

19:29.969 --> 19:31.438
He asked if I was
dating Quinn.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.839
I told him to
mind his own business.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.708
He swore at me,
pushed me, so I hit him.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.510
In the face.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.845
Never saw him again.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.713
- You tell her about this?
- No.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.649
I, uh--I didn't want to
freak her out.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.852
Just that I saw someone
and she should be careful.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.654
Wait, you're not gonna
arrest me for hitting

19:47.687 --> 19:49.322
some assclown, are you?

19:49.356 --> 19:52.325
- No, we want to show you
some photos, though.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.628
- That look like the assclown
you punched in the face?

19:55.662 --> 19:58.698
- No.
- What about this guy?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.837
- I definitely wasn't
stalking Quinn, all right?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.474
It was more like
due diligence.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.608
- Excuse me?

20:08.641 --> 20:09.809
- Look, I just--
I wanted to know

20:09.842 --> 20:10.910
whether or not
she was dating

20:10.943 --> 20:12.745
this Jack Price
dude or not.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.547
[chuckles]

20:14.581 --> 20:16.549
Look, my cousin,
he has this sweet pad in Aspen,

20:16.583 --> 20:18.451
he told me that I could
use it for the weekend,

20:18.485 --> 20:19.752
and I was gonna invite Quinn.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.489
But I just wanted to know
if she was involved,

20:22.522 --> 20:24.891
so I went to her apartment
one morning.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.859
- And later that same night.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.396
- Okay, okay--yeah, yeah, I sort
of freaked out a little bit,

20:29.429 --> 20:30.897
but I wasn't stalking her,
for God's sake.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.565
I mean,
not in a creepy way.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.767
- There's no other way
to stalk someone.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.537
- No, what I mean...

20:39.038 --> 20:41.908
Okay, Quinn and I...

20:41.941 --> 20:44.477
I thought we were connecting.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.513
And one night,
we sort of hooked up.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.648
Or, or--
no, I mean, we kissed,

20:48.681 --> 20:51.518
but--so I asked her out,
and she shut me down, and...

20:51.551 --> 20:53.453
- You what?

20:53.486 --> 20:55.622
- I couldn't let it go.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.889
All right?
No, I'm not proud of that.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.625
But I couldn't stop
thinking about her,

20:58.658 --> 21:00.793
and then I just--I heard her
talking about some guy,

21:00.827 --> 21:02.895
and I couldn't get that image of
Quinn and some random guy

21:02.929 --> 21:04.697
out of my head.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.899
Wait, no--can you please just
not tell her about any of this?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.701
She's never gonna forgive me,
and after what

21:08.735 --> 21:10.570
she's gone through,
she'll hate me.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.672
- Before we worry about that,
we need to talk about you

21:12.705 --> 21:14.941
and the night of the assault.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.610
After you left the bar, did you
walk over to her apartment?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.479
- No, after that frat dude
hit me in the face,

21:19.512 --> 21:20.680
I never went back, ever.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.014
- But you--you called her
that night?

21:22.048 --> 21:23.650
- Yeah.
- After you left the bar.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.752
- Yeah, to apologize,
but she didn't pick up.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.687
- And where were you
when you called her?

21:27.720 --> 21:30.657
- I--okay, I was right outside
a Korean deli,

21:30.690 --> 21:33.926
right near my apartment on,
like, Spring and Varick.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.463
Okay, I bought chocolate almonds
and a pack of cigarettes.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.831
- You smoke?
- On occasion, yeah.

21:38.865 --> 21:39.999
- Mm, it's bad
for your health.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.934
Causes cancer.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.704
Even in millennials.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.006
- Don't put the shovel
down yet, Ryan.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.841
Keep digging.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.811
- This guy's annoying, but--
- But what?

21:51.844 --> 21:53.513
- My gut says
he's not our guy.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.915
- Well, that is good,
but DNA's better.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.618
- I agree, but not in this case.
- What does that mean?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.587
- The DNA for the
cigarette butt came back.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.755
It's a match
for Ray Wilson.

22:02.789 --> 22:03.823
- Ray Wilson?

22:03.856 --> 22:05.725
The guy with
the airtight alibi?

22:05.758 --> 22:06.926
- That's the one.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.463
- Okay,
so if Wilson was in Jersey

22:10.497 --> 22:13.666
all night, praying,
how the hell did his cigarette

22:13.700 --> 22:16.736
end up in Quinn's courtyard

22:16.769 --> 22:17.837
in the West Village?

22:26.913 --> 22:28.815
- So Wilson was in New Jersey,
but his cigarettes

22:28.848 --> 22:29.782
and DNA were in Manhattan--
that makes sense.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.685
- Maybe he was there
another time.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.920
A night or two
before the assault.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.655
- It's possible,
but it poured like hell

22:35.688 --> 22:36.789
the night before
Quinn was attacked.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.024
Now, the lab said
that the sample

22:38.057 --> 22:39.659
was too pristine
to have been in the rain.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.060
- So the cigarette
had to be dropped there

22:41.093 --> 22:42.429
the night of the assault.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.696
- Which means it was planted.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.498
- Which means that
somebody was following

22:45.532 --> 22:47.567
Ray Wilson, waiting for him
to drop a cigarette.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.604
So let's go back, talk to
Wilson, and see if maybe

22:51.638 --> 22:54.474
he remembers somebody
following him, watching him.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.076
- So the stalker
was being stalked.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.613
Is that ironic or just weird?
- Both.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.990
- Now what?

23:11.023 --> 23:13.760
Pinning me with
the Kennedy assassination?

23:13.793 --> 23:16.629
- No, we actually
believe you.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.565
We know you weren't
in Manhattan the night

23:18.598 --> 23:19.666
that Quinn was attacked.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.668
- Okay.
So why are you here?

23:21.701 --> 23:22.869
- Well, we think
someone planted

23:22.902 --> 23:24.604
your cigarette butt there
at the scene.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.639
- Notice anybody suspicious
watching you?

23:26.673 --> 23:28.007
- When you get out of the can,
you feel like

23:28.040 --> 23:30.009
the whole damn world
is watching you.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.711
Judging you, hating you.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.047
- Anybody in particular?

23:35.081 --> 23:36.883
- Uh, yeah,
I noticed, uh...

23:36.916 --> 23:37.884
a car.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.519
- Following you?

23:39.552 --> 23:40.887
- It was parked near
the restaurant.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.590
Uh, black Cadillac, I think.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.592
I was taking a smoke break,
and I noticed a car

23:45.625 --> 23:47.026
double parked,
engine running.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.861
- Okay, when was this?

23:48.895 --> 23:50.963
- Uh, day before you guys
barged into my restaurant

23:50.997 --> 23:52.865
and accused me
of assaulting Quinn.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.667
- You see a face?
- No.

23:54.701 --> 23:55.968
- How 'bout a plate?

23:56.002 --> 23:59.005
- [chuckles]
I'm not a cop, I'm a chef.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.578
Used to be, anyway,
till you guys showed up.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.715
I got fired yesterday.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.719
- Okay, so what do we got?

24:12.752 --> 24:14.554
- Surveillance footage
from the restaurant

24:14.587 --> 24:15.788
where Wilson used to work.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.056
There this black Cadillac,
he comes,

24:17.089 --> 24:18.925
he parks outside of
the restaurant, right?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.761
It's the same day that Quinn
got assaulted, 3:05 p.m.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.096
Son he gets out, he runs
towards the kitchen entrance,

24:24.130 --> 24:25.832
and then about
five seconds later,

24:25.865 --> 24:27.066
he runs back and he takes off.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.868
- Okay, so this is
the entrance where Wilson

24:28.901 --> 24:30.703
takes his smoke breaks.
- Yeah, the same one.

24:30.737 --> 24:33.740
- And--so this guy leaves
with his cigarette butt.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.808
- Seems that way.
- All right, we run the plates?

24:35.842 --> 24:38.177
- We sure did--the car is
registered to Linda Cole

24:38.210 --> 24:39.812
of Montclair, New Jersey.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.815
- As in the wife of
Sergeant Tom Cole?

24:42.849 --> 24:44.917
Quinn's cop friend
and savior?

24:44.951 --> 24:46.753
- That's right.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.856
- So our hero, retired cop
planted the evidence?

24:49.889 --> 24:52.592
- To bury Wilson because he
assumes he committed the crime,

24:52.625 --> 24:56.696
or to cover his own ass,
because he's the perp?

24:56.729 --> 24:59.566
- Well, it has to be the latter.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.000
'Cause he grabbed
the cigarette butt

25:01.033 --> 25:02.769
before the assault
even occurred.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.004
- Which would mean he planned
this whole thing.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.106
- So go back
and talk to Sergeant Cole,

25:07.139 --> 25:10.810
and see if he admits parking
his car at the restaurant.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.012
We'll see if we can
catch him in a lie.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.214
Be careful, guys,
because he may be retired,

25:15.247 --> 25:17.984
but he's still a cop.

25:18.017 --> 25:24.123
*

25:24.156 --> 25:26.025
- I really appreciate you
meeting with us, Tom.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.694
- Time, I got.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.195
- Well, in a turn worthy of
Ripley's,

25:29.228 --> 25:31.798
CSU actually got back to us
real quick with some results.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.132
- Under three days.
Who'd you bribe?

25:33.165 --> 25:34.767
- Exactly.

25:34.801 --> 25:35.835
We found a cigarette butt

25:35.868 --> 25:36.936
outside of Quinn's door,

25:36.969 --> 25:38.805
had Wilson's DNA
all over it.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.207
- There you go--once a scumbag,
always a scumbag.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.009
So you sure he's the guy?

25:43.042 --> 25:46.012
- He's looking good, but the
timeline is a little spotty.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.714
That's why we're
trying to eliminate

25:47.747 --> 25:49.015
all potential suspects.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.717
- It's more like
theoretical suspects,

25:50.750 --> 25:51.984
'cause this prosecutor, right?

25:52.018 --> 25:53.720
This guy, Barba,
he's very methodical,

25:53.753 --> 25:55.722
he wants us to cross
every T, right,

25:55.755 --> 25:56.889
before we make our collar.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.725
- And that's why
we're here.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.060
He wants us to rule out
every man that Quinn talked to

26:01.093 --> 26:02.061
the day of the incident.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.062
- And phone records show

26:03.095 --> 26:04.731
that you called Quinn

26:04.764 --> 26:06.198
wha--a few times the day
before the incident

26:06.232 --> 26:07.734
and once the day of.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.168
- Yeah, I wanted to
give her an update

26:09.201 --> 26:12.171
on Wilson--I talked to his
parole officer that day.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.040
I feel so sick
about all of this.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.843
This punk, Wilson,
deserves to die.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.177
- I don't disagree.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.647
- So, if you don't mind,
can you tell us

26:20.680 --> 26:22.048
where you were
the night of the assault?

26:22.081 --> 26:24.283
- I get it, you need an alibi
to make the ADA happy.

26:24.316 --> 26:27.153
- Like I said, this guy's
a complete pain in the ass.

26:27.186 --> 26:30.189
- Unless there's a reason
you don't want to tell us.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.724
- Nah, it's fine.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.760
I was in full
retirement mode.

26:33.793 --> 26:34.927
Had a nice dinner
with the wife,

26:34.961 --> 26:36.729
then I was down
in the basement all night.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.064
I'm building a new
wine cellar.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.198
That's my new hobby.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.267
- What, collecting or drinking?
- Both.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.069
- Let me know when
you make the collar.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.072
I'll crack a bottle of Bordeaux
in Wilson's honor.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.840
- You know what,
we can crack the bottle

26:47.874 --> 26:49.942
at that restaurant
he just got fired from.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.844
- Mr. Chef.
- Sous chef.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.680
- Right, sous chef.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.115
For the longest time, I thought
people were saying soup chef.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.750
- [laughs]
- What the hell do I know?

26:57.784 --> 26:59.952
I'm just a dumb cop
from Jersey.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.754
- So that's where
you talked to Wilson,

27:01.788 --> 27:03.289
at that restaurant?

27:03.322 --> 27:04.757
- The restaurant?
No.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.092
Never been there.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.761
I talked to him in Jersey
outside his apartment.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.263
- Appreciate your time, Tom.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.132
- Thanks for your help.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.234
*

27:21.741 --> 27:22.008
.

27:22.041 --> 27:22.474
[children shouting]

27:24.076 --> 27:25.244
- Thank you so much.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.014
Linda.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.315
Sorry to bother you at work.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.017
- Lieutenant,
what're you doing here?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.085
- Well, we had
some follow-up questions

27:33.119 --> 27:35.354
about Quinn we were hoping
to talk to you about.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.156
- Oh, well, how can I help?

27:37.189 --> 27:39.358
- Confidentially, we're circling
Ray Wilson for this.

27:39.391 --> 27:42.995
- You know, so we think that
he'd been following her

27:43.029 --> 27:44.731
for about a month,
and now, of course,

27:44.764 --> 27:47.366
we have to prove it, which is
easier said than done.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.268
- Yeah, so we're trying to
come up with a timeline

27:49.301 --> 27:51.170
of where Quinn has been.
We're gonna start with the night

27:51.203 --> 27:52.739
of the assault
and then move backwards.

27:52.772 --> 27:55.007
- Okay, makes sense.
- Okay.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.810
So Quinn told me
that she had dinner

27:57.844 --> 27:59.979
with you and Tom
the night of the assault.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.381
- No, I haven't seen her
for months.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.451
I don't know why
she would say that.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.821
- Well, you know,
maybe she got confused.

28:08.855 --> 28:11.123
You know, that's not unusual--
this type of trauma

28:11.157 --> 28:12.825
can cause memory issues.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.994
- So, um...

28:15.027 --> 28:17.329
you're absolutely sure that she
wasn't at your house that night.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.831
- No, it was just me and Tom.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.433
- A nice, quiet,
romantic dinner, huh?

28:21.467 --> 28:24.436
- Yeah, something like that.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.739
We, uh,
ate until about 8:30,

28:26.773 --> 28:28.407
and then he went down
to the basement.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.242
He's building
a wine cellar there.

28:30.276 --> 28:34.146
- Ah.

28:34.180 --> 28:37.249
- [chuckles]

28:37.283 --> 28:40.853
Is my husband a suspect,
Lieutenant?

28:40.887 --> 28:43.222
- Yes.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.291
He is.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.360
- [pants]

28:50.362 --> 28:52.164
- And if you know something,

28:52.198 --> 28:54.834
please tell us.

28:54.867 --> 28:58.504
*

28:58.537 --> 29:02.108
Linda, we need your help.

29:02.141 --> 29:05.444
You have a daughter.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.480
And Quinn told us
that they were friends.

29:08.514 --> 29:14.153
*

29:14.186 --> 29:18.190
- I can't believe
this is happening.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.359
- The night of the assault...

29:20.392 --> 29:22.261
Was Tom really
in the basement all night,

29:22.294 --> 29:24.330
working on a wine cellar?

29:27.199 --> 29:30.236
- He was, for a while.

29:32.538 --> 29:35.774
But he was angry.
He was distracted.

29:37.877 --> 29:38.845
And then he left.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.212
He said that he was

29:40.246 --> 29:41.447
going to Home Depot,

29:41.480 --> 29:42.514
but I didn't see him again

29:42.548 --> 29:45.251
until the morning.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.154
He said...

29:48.187 --> 29:52.224
if anyone ever asks, tell them
that he was home all night.

29:52.258 --> 29:55.161
- Okay, Linda...

29:55.194 --> 29:58.230
is there someone that you can
stay with for a while?

30:00.266 --> 30:01.567
- My sister.

30:01.600 --> 30:06.372
- Go to her today.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.874
We'll be in touch.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.509
*

30:10.542 --> 30:13.412
Cole's wife just blew
his alibi wide open.

30:13.445 --> 30:14.580
- Open enough to bring him in?

30:14.613 --> 30:16.448
- Uh, yes--call Barba

30:16.482 --> 30:19.318
and have him issue
an arrest warrant.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.253
Track down Quinn.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.955
I think she's staying at the,
uh,

30:22.989 --> 30:25.257
Park Milano with her mother.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.326
Tell her what's going on.
- On it.

30:27.359 --> 30:34.200
*

30:34.233 --> 30:35.935
- Hey, Detective Rollins,
Tutuola.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.237
We're looking for a guest of
yours, Quinn Berris.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.572
- She stayed here the past few
nights with her mother.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.641
- Oh, sure,
I saw her 20 minutes ago.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.643
Very nice young woman.
- Was she alone?

30:44.676 --> 30:47.246
- No, I think
she was with a man.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.981
- Is this the guy?

30:49.015 --> 30:51.450
- Oh, I'm not sure--
I didn't get a real good look.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.919
- She didn't say
where she was going.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.155
- No, sorry.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.589
- Quinn,
it's Detective Rollins.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.291
Please call me
or Lieutenant Benson

30:59.325 --> 31:00.659
as soon as you get this.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.262
- I'll call Liv,
let her know what's going on.

31:03.295 --> 31:06.332
*

31:10.436 --> 31:12.905
- What is it now?
- We're looking for Quinn.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.673
- Why?
What happened?

31:14.706 --> 31:16.475
Is she okay?
- We don't know.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.477
Somebody disabled her phone
and we can't trace it.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.446
- [sighs]
I just--

31:20.479 --> 31:22.915
I don't believe that Tom would
actually do something like this.

31:22.949 --> 31:26.252
- Linda, listen to me,
assume for a minute that he did.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.287
Okay?
Now, where would he be heading?

31:28.320 --> 31:30.222
Any place he'd hide?

31:30.256 --> 31:33.960
- Do you own any other property?
- No.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.494
Oh, God...

31:35.527 --> 31:38.564
Tom's brother has an old
farmhouse in Harding.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.665
He's never there.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.334
He lives in Boston.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.503
Tom's been doing some
renovation work for him.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.306
- Linda, I know that this is
very difficult for you.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.476
But I need the exact address
and I need it now.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.279
Hey, how we doing on that BOLO?

31:53.312 --> 31:54.680
- Well, bridge
and tunnel authorities

31:54.713 --> 31:57.016
have his license plate
and his photo, but no hits.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.484
- Okay, well, Carisi and I

31:58.517 --> 32:00.953
are following up on a lead
from Cole's wife.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.721
It's a farmhouse
out in Harding,

32:02.754 --> 32:04.323
about ten minutes away.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.025
After that,
we'll head back to the city.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.360
- I just got an E-ZPass photo
from the GW Bridge.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.962
It's Cole.
He's got Quinn.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.363
She's sitting right beside him.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.732
- Okay, and when was it taken?

32:13.765 --> 32:15.401
- 45 minutes ago.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.636
- Okay, call the state police
and the FBI now.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.672
We need all the help on this
that we can get, okay?

32:20.706 --> 32:23.509
- Yeah, this is Detective
Amanda Rollins, NYPD, SVU.

32:33.719 --> 32:33.852
.

32:33.885 --> 32:34.220
- This is it.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.723
- All right,
let's take a look around.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.632
Be careful, Carisi.
- I'm good.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.701
- Hey.
I said be careful.

32:51.403 --> 32:58.644
*

33:06.685 --> 33:09.788
- Looks empty.
- Yep.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.190
- Whoa, whoa.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.425
Black Cadillac.
- Okay, ready?

33:13.459 --> 33:15.027
Here we go.

33:15.061 --> 33:22.101
*

33:29.475 --> 33:32.678
Gun!

33:34.813 --> 33:37.316
Sergeant Cole?

33:37.349 --> 33:39.385
It's Lieutenant Benson.
I know you're up there.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.786
- Help!

33:40.819 --> 33:43.289
He's got a gun!

33:43.322 --> 33:45.424
- This is Detective Carisi,
SVU.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.227
I'm at 31 Timber Lane Road.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.762
I got one suspect.
He's barricaded, he's armed.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.264
He's got one hostage.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.333
Send a tactical team and HNT
right now.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.403
[cell phone buzzes]

33:59.205 --> 34:02.108
- Lieutenant Benson.
- You need to leave now.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.509
- Let's just talk this through,
Sergeant.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.411
Let's just talk this through.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.513
- There's nothing to say.
- Oh, sure there is.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.181
There's always
something to say.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.283
And I want to hear
what you have to say.

34:11.317 --> 34:16.488
I want to understand, but first,
you need to let Quinn go, okay?

34:16.522 --> 34:18.390
- She's safe.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.092
She's here with me.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.693
Where she belongs.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.229
- No, Cole.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.097
Quinn belongs in New York.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.433
She belongs with her family,
she belongs with her friends,

34:27.466 --> 34:29.868
and you know that because
you're a very, very smart man.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.803
You are a career
police officer

34:31.837 --> 34:33.539
and I know that you
understand that.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.541
- I know what you're doing,
Benson.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.543
You can save
the psychobabble.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.412
I said the same things
when I was on the job.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.282
Make the perp feel safe,
empowered.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.850
Treat him with respect.

34:44.883 --> 34:47.219
It's all crap.
I know it, you know it.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.188
- Okay, then I'm gonna
shoot you straight

34:49.221 --> 34:51.223
and tell you that you and I
need to figure out something

34:51.257 --> 34:55.527
very fast before the SWAT team
and before the FBI get here.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.563
Can we do that?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.131
- Be quiet.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.566
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.768
- I'm gonna see
if I can make eyes on him.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.770
- [mouthing] Be careful.

35:04.803 --> 35:11.843
*

35:14.313 --> 35:15.914
- For a second...

35:15.947 --> 35:17.783
for a stupid second,

35:17.816 --> 35:19.351
I thought she cared about me.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.153
[gun clicks]

35:21.187 --> 35:23.255
And she was grateful
I came into her life,

35:23.289 --> 35:25.791
and she understood the
sacrifices a guy like me makes

35:25.824 --> 35:27.259
to keep her safe.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.496
- You did.
And you did keep her safe.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.332
And you need to
keep her safe now.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.933
- And have her spit
in my face again?

35:34.966 --> 35:38.604
Not return my calls?

35:38.637 --> 35:40.806
Cancel dinner?

35:43.342 --> 35:45.211
All my life,
beautiful whores like you

35:45.244 --> 35:47.246
taking advantage--
look the other way.

35:49.281 --> 35:53.252
You know what I did
for 20 years?

35:53.285 --> 35:55.787
The things I saw.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.557
The lives I saved.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.825
You don't care.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.427
- I care.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.796
And I care because
I understand.

36:04.830 --> 36:09.968
*

36:10.001 --> 36:14.940
You and I
have spent our lives on the job,

36:14.973 --> 36:16.808
given it our all.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.610
And you're right.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.247
We are taken for granted.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.249
People don't get it,
they don't understand.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.316
You're absolutely right.

36:24.350 --> 36:29.255
*

36:29.288 --> 36:30.322
It doesn't feel good,

36:30.356 --> 36:31.457
but you and I both know

36:31.490 --> 36:34.560
that that's not Quinn's fault.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.828
So you need to let her go.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.430
Okay?

36:38.464 --> 36:41.567
You're a cop, I know that
you understand this.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.469
So I need you to listen to me

36:43.502 --> 36:46.672
and understand that
you have the opportunity

36:46.705 --> 36:48.874
right now, right here,

36:48.907 --> 36:52.944
to stand up
and do the right thing

36:52.978 --> 36:54.613
one more time.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.348
- You mean one last time.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.417
- Tom...

36:58.450 --> 37:00.619
Listen to me, I want you
to think about your wife.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.322
I want you to think about Linda,
that woman that loves you.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.691
I want you to think about
your daughter who loves you.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.259
They both love you.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.960
- [whimpering]
- Now listen to me...

37:08.994 --> 37:10.529
- They don't love me.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.464
- Yes, they do.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.599
Tom?

37:13.632 --> 37:16.602
Tom, there's a future here.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.004
You have a future.

37:19.037 --> 37:22.007
- [crying]
- No, there isn't.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.243
- [whimpering]

37:30.716 --> 37:35.487
- 20 years I gave.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.589
Tell Linda I'm sorry.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.425
- Listen to me, listen to me,
you take a breath--

37:39.458 --> 37:40.592
listen to me right now.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.361
Okay?
Don't hang up on me.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.496
- I'm really sorry.

37:44.530 --> 37:47.533
- Aah!
- I did the best I could.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.372
- Tom.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.673
Oh, Tom...

37:54.706 --> 37:57.709
- [whimpering]

37:57.743 --> 38:04.950
*

38:06.418 --> 38:09.388
- [crying]

38:09.421 --> 38:16.428
*

38:38.717 --> 38:40.118
- [muffled cries]

38:40.151 --> 38:42.788
*

38:42.821 --> 38:46.792
[muffled crying continues]

38:46.825 --> 38:53.999
*

39:01.139 --> 39:03.709
- Drop your weapon now.

39:03.742 --> 39:06.445
*

39:06.478 --> 39:09.047
- Okay.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.487
Don't do this.

39:15.521 --> 39:19.124
I'm a cop,
just like you.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.659
It doesn't have to end
like this.

39:20.692 --> 39:24.996
*

39:25.030 --> 39:26.532
- It's too late for that.

39:26.565 --> 39:30.436
*

39:30.469 --> 39:32.103
[gunfire]

39:32.137 --> 39:36.374
- [panting]
- [whimpering]

39:38.777 --> 39:43.449
- You're all right.
You're all right.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.816
Quinn?

39:44.850 --> 39:46.752
Quinn, look at me.
Look at me.

39:46.785 --> 39:47.653
Quinn?

39:47.686 --> 39:49.521
Quinn, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

39:49.555 --> 39:50.822
You're safe.
- [cries]

39:50.856 --> 39:52.123
- Quinn, you're safe now.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.625
You're safe.
- [cries]

39:53.659 --> 39:55.193
- You're safe.

39:55.226 --> 40:00.732
*

40:00.766 --> 40:03.502
I got you.
I got you.

40:03.535 --> 40:06.104
Shh.
- [cries]

40:06.137 --> 40:13.178
*

40:17.883 --> 40:19.685
- I got you.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.122
- How you holding up, Liv?

40:24.155 --> 40:26.191
- I'm fine.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.627
- The LBA is sending a
representative to the station.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.529
He'll be with you
when you make your statement.

40:30.562 --> 40:34.099
- Got it, thanks.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.768
Hey, so they're gonna
take you to the hospital

40:36.802 --> 40:38.737
for precautionary purposes,
all right?

40:38.770 --> 40:42.173
- He said I was ungrateful.

40:42.207 --> 40:45.544
I appreciated him, I did--
I don't understand--

40:45.577 --> 40:46.912
- Quinn.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.581
This is not your fault.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.683
You hear me?

40:51.717 --> 40:54.119
Guys like Cole, they're...

40:54.152 --> 40:55.854
they're predators.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.524
And they look for light
and they look for goodness

40:58.557 --> 41:02.661
and they--
and they try to steal it.

41:02.694 --> 41:06.197
But promise me you will not
blame yourself for this.

41:10.135 --> 41:11.737
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

41:11.770 --> 41:18.810
*

41:22.981 --> 41:25.250
- Hey, how's she doing?

41:25.283 --> 41:27.586
- She doesn't understand
why he would do this to her.

41:27.619 --> 41:28.754
- Neither do I.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.121
Maybe all those years
on the job,

41:30.155 --> 41:31.623
dealing with the worst
of the worst,

41:31.657 --> 41:33.158
I mean, how do you
come out of that clean?

41:33.191 --> 41:36.628
- No, being a cop
didn't change him.

41:36.662 --> 41:39.665
He was always bad,
it just...

41:39.698 --> 41:41.900
it just took time
to come out.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.637
- Lieutenant, thank you.

41:45.671 --> 41:48.640
For helping me out back there--
I owe you one.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.978
Hope this doesn't make you
want to retire.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.213
- Nope.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.982
The exact opposite.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.652
