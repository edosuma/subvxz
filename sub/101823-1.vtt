(Dave laughing)

01:23.150 --> 01:23.983
- I love you.

01:44.770 --> 01:47.620
- Look, I don't want you to feel like

01:47.620 --> 01:50.033
any of this is your fault.

01:53.030 --> 01:53.863
- Okay.

01:57.686 --> 02:00.519
(Catherine sighs)

02:01.430 --> 02:03.130
Dave I don't know how to say this.

02:07.560 --> 02:12.560
I just feel like this
isn't working between us.

02:13.180 --> 02:17.070
I've been feeling lately
this is all too much

02:17.070 --> 02:19.010
and we're two very different people

02:19.010 --> 02:22.883
and I want what's best for
me and for you as well.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.113
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

02:28.560 --> 02:31.523
- No, no I'm confused.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.613
- I think I need some space.

02:38.540 --> 02:39.703
We need space.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.033
- Wait, are you breaking up with me?

02:51.499 --> 02:55.130
(Catherine sighs)

02:55.130 --> 02:56.370
- Yes.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.433
Yes Dave, I'm breaking up with you.

02:59.397 --> 03:01.358
I can't do it anymore.

03:01.358 --> 03:03.540
(Catherine sighs)

03:03.540 --> 03:06.631
- But I thought we were good.

03:06.631 --> 03:09.540
Was it something I said,
did I do something like...

03:09.540 --> 03:11.060
Please, tell me.

03:11.060 --> 03:14.110
- No, no it's nothing
you did, Dave please.

03:14.110 --> 03:14.943
I just...

03:14.943 --> 03:16.370
I need some space, okay?

03:16.370 --> 03:21.130
Please just respect what
I am asking of you, okay?

03:21.130 --> 03:21.963
Please.

03:23.110 --> 03:25.743
I'm sorry, I have to go.

03:29.420 --> 03:30.253
- Cath.

03:33.330 --> 03:34.313
- I'm sorry, Dave.

03:35.390 --> 03:36.223
Please.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.091
I have to go.

03:39.091 --> 03:41.841
(desolate music)

04:17.360 --> 04:18.900
- [Catherine] Hey, this is Catherine.

04:18.900 --> 04:20.590
I can't come to the phone right now,

04:20.590 --> 04:23.290

- Hey.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.900
- You okay?

05:01.900 --> 05:04.120
Aren't you supposed to be
at the park with Catherine?

05:04.120 --> 05:05.793
- Bro, she broke up with me.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.190
- What? Are you serious?

05:10.190 --> 05:11.040
What happened?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.040
- She said that we...

05:12.040 --> 05:14.154
That she needed space,

05:14.154 --> 05:16.959
and that we weren't on the same page.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.680
- Wow.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.910
- Yeah, it's bullshit.

05:20.910 --> 05:23.060
- You guys seemed fine earlier today.

05:23.060 --> 05:24.210
Did you do something to upset her?

05:24.210 --> 05:25.043
- No.

05:26.020 --> 05:29.780
No, we were fine until we got here

05:29.780 --> 05:32.525
and then she sprung all the shit on me.

05:32.525 --> 05:35.830
- Oh dude, I'm so sorry
I don't know what to say.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.503
- Yeah, it fucking sucks.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.360
- Where are you right now?

05:40.360 --> 05:41.930
Are you coming back to the apartment?

05:41.930 --> 05:43.780
- I'm actually heading back now.

05:43.780 --> 05:45.260
- Okay, yeah, I'll be here.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.863
- Okay, yeah I'll see what I get there.

05:47.863 --> 05:49.000
All right.

05:49.000 --> 05:49.833

Yo, this chicks are so fucking beat.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.690
Hey what's up man, how you doing?

06:50.690 --> 06:52.056
- Hey, I'm good.

06:52.056 --> 06:53.630
- Oh my God, it's worse than I thought.

06:53.630 --> 06:54.860
Okay, sit down.

06:54.860 --> 06:57.540
You and I are having a beer,
we're talking about it.

- Okay.

07:00.525 --> 07:03.982
(bottles clinking)

07:03.982 --> 07:06.815
- There you go man, cold one on me

07:07.980 --> 07:09.923
- Thanks.
- Time to blow off some steam.

07:11.820 --> 07:12.853
To new beginnings.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.713
- I guess.

07:17.110 --> 07:17.943
- All right, man.

07:17.943 --> 07:19.250
I know this sucks,

07:19.250 --> 07:22.410
but you're gonna to find
a new girl in no time.

07:22.410 --> 07:24.570
There's plenty of them out there.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.290
Remember those girls we
met last week at the bar?

07:27.290 --> 07:28.380
- Yeah, yeah.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.696
The one with the funny voice.

07:30.696 --> 07:34.240
- (mumbling) Okay, yeah.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.370
To be fair her voice fucking sucked,

07:36.370 --> 07:39.210
but she was hot and so
were all of our friends.

07:39.210 --> 07:42.830
I'm thinking you and me
take 'em out next week,

07:42.830 --> 07:45.477
get some drinks, see
where it goes from there,

07:45.477 --> 07:48.200
try to get some double date
action going eventually.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.100
What do you think?

07:51.660 --> 07:52.560
- I don't know.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.393
- Yeah.

07:54.730 --> 07:58.093
- This all came out of nowhere
and happened really fast.

08:00.420 --> 08:03.020
I need some time to
wrap my head around it.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.800
- No, what you need is to
have one of her friends

08:05.800 --> 08:08.110
wrap her lips around your dick.

08:08.110 --> 08:09.110
That's all you need.

08:13.490 --> 08:15.280
Okay, you're not laughing.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.270
Sorry, I didn't mean to be insensitive

08:17.270 --> 08:19.110
to your situation, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

08:19.110 --> 08:21.370
- I'm a good friend, I'm
gonna give you two weeks

08:21.370 --> 08:22.240
to get over this hunch.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.550
But by then, I want you
balls deep in some new pussy,

08:25.550 --> 08:26.453
you got that?

08:27.630 --> 08:29.273
- How the fuck did this happen?

08:31.060 --> 08:33.770
Really, like how am I
best friends with you?

08:33.770 --> 08:36.130
- Please, I'm the best thing
that's ever happened to you,

08:36.130 --> 08:36.963
and you know it.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.923
I'm gonna get fucking
smashed tonight I can't

10:01.733 --> 10:02.866
- [Kathleen] You're
welcome, have a good day.

10:02.866 --> 10:03.699
- You too.

10:14.843 --> 10:15.676
Oh shit!

10:15.676 --> 10:18.612
(car tires screeching)

10:18.612 --> 10:19.695
Motherfucker.

10:22.146 --> 10:24.646
(car honking)

10:28.180 --> 10:31.373
Oh yeah, fuck you too, fuck you.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.208

10:52.122 --> 10:54.872
(car door bangs)

10:56.334 --> 10:57.590

10:57.590 --> 10:58.550

10:58.550 --> 10:59.423
Get in here.

11:03.197 --> 11:04.580

11:04.580 --> 11:05.760
- Hey boss, you wanted to see me?

11:05.760 --> 11:08.447
- Come in here Dave, sit down.

11:08.447 --> 11:11.114
(door squeaks)

11:21.200 --> 11:22.033
- Look boss I'm sorry-

11:22.033 --> 11:23.710
- Shut the fuck up.

11:23.710 --> 11:26.690
Shut up, don't say another word.

11:26.690 --> 11:28.960
I'm sick and tired of you, all right?

11:28.960 --> 11:30.220
What did I tell you?

11:30.220 --> 11:32.860
What did I tell you when I hired you?

11:32.860 --> 11:34.340
- You don't like people being late.

11:34.340 --> 11:38.300
- That's right, because
time is money, right?

11:38.300 --> 11:40.320
You're supposed to be here on time.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.153
What is it gonna take

11:41.153 --> 11:43.530
to get that through your thick skull?

11:43.530 --> 11:48.130
- Boss, I apologize it
will not happen again.

11:48.130 --> 11:51.770
- Exactly, who is in charge here?

11:51.770 --> 11:52.603
Who's in charge?

11:53.570 --> 11:54.403
- You are.

11:54.403 --> 11:55.770
- [Ross] Say it again.

11:55.770 --> 11:57.400
- You are.

11:57.400 --> 12:01.360
- Going forward, you
will not be late again.

12:01.360 --> 12:05.403
This is the second fucking
time you've done this.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.110
Now Dave what's gonna happen,

12:08.110 --> 12:10.340
you're gonna work today,
and you're gonna be...

12:10.340 --> 12:11.850
You're gonna lose a fucking hour.

12:11.850 --> 12:12.919
- What?
- A whole fucking hour.

12:12.919 --> 12:14.250
You're not getting no lunch.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.374
No fucking lunch.

12:15.374 --> 12:17.620
Now get the fuck up and
get the hell outta here.

12:17.620 --> 12:18.630
Get outta here.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.070
- This is bullshit.

12:22.070 --> 12:22.903
- Bullshit?

12:22.903 --> 12:24.290
Why don't you go change your fucking shirt

12:24.290 --> 12:25.698
and look like your work
here for Christ sakes.

12:25.698 --> 12:26.656
(door squeaks)

12:26.656 --> 12:28.190
(door bangs)

12:28.190 --> 12:29.483
Fucking jerk off.

12:37.370 --> 12:38.453
Fucking kids.

12:44.518 --> 12:47.601
(car engine revving)

12:51.674 --> 12:52.515
- Hey.

12:52.515 --> 12:53.348
- Not now Ed is not a good time.

12:53.348 --> 12:54.760
- Hey fuck face.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.370
- Not now.
- Talking to you, hey.

12:56.370 --> 12:59.390
- What the fuck Ed, I told
you to leave me alone.

12:59.390 --> 13:00.470
I'm not having a good day.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.000
- Fuck that, what'd you do to my sister?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.090
- What?

13:03.090 --> 13:05.220
Nothing she broke up with me.

13:05.220 --> 13:07.190
- Why is she so upset then?

13:07.190 --> 13:09.870
- I don't know, why don't you ask her?

13:09.870 --> 13:11.800
She broke up with me for no reason.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.250
- I swear Dave, did something to her,

13:13.250 --> 13:15.100
I'm gonna kick your little fucking ass.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.810
- You swear, really?

13:16.810 --> 13:21.350
After all this time, you think
I would do something to her?

13:21.350 --> 13:22.480
- Well, let me tell you something.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.460
If I find out you did
anything her, I swear.

13:25.460 --> 13:26.790
- You swear what? Huh?

13:26.790 --> 13:28.720
What? You gonna do something to me?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.370
- What the fuck the two of you doing?

13:30.370 --> 13:33.560
Get the fuck back, Ed

13:33.560 --> 13:34.680
Get to work.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.157
And you, you're on tires all goddam day.

13:36.157 --> 13:37.907

13:38.952 --> 13:39.900
I'm gonna tell you right now,

13:39.900 --> 13:42.502
take that testosterone
and could bring it over to

13:42.502 --> 13:43.602

13:46.993 --> 13:49.743
(dramatic music)

13:57.514 --> 14:00.460
(pad clicking)

14:00.460 --> 14:03.293
(phone vibrating)

14:07.320 --> 14:08.550
- Hey, what's up?

14:08.550 --> 14:09.993
- Yo, you off the clock?

14:10.900 --> 14:12.300
- Yeah, I just got back.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.333
- Just got home, we're all
at the bar waiting for you

14:14.333 --> 14:17.991

here, get out of the house.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.408
(Dave sighs)

14:22.160 --> 14:24.527
- All right, give me some time

14:24.527 --> 14:26.100
and I'll see you in a little bit.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.170

He's coming down.

14:28.003 --> 14:28.970
A'ight, see you soon.

(gentle music)

14:52.346 --> 14:55.429
(indistinct chatter)

14:59.877 --> 15:00.863
- Hey Dave.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.160
- Hey.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.023
- What's up man?

15:06.260 --> 15:09.060
I haven't seen you around in
a while, where's Catherine?

15:09.980 --> 15:12.113
- Yeah that's a long story.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.853
- Sorry man.

15:17.820 --> 15:18.653
- Yeah.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.240
- What you having?

15:22.240 --> 15:23.123
- Just the usual.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.800
- Okay, I'll tell you what have a seat,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.000

15:44.760 --> 15:45.943
- What's up guys?

15:48.770 --> 15:50.993
It's kinda quiet in here, huh?

15:50.993 --> 15:51.830
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:51.830 --> 15:52.840
- I'm sure they're gonna pour in soon.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.473
- Yeah, it's still early come on.

15:56.050 --> 15:56.883
- Thank you.

15:56.883 --> 15:57.716
- You're welcome, enjoy.

15:59.052 --> 16:02.252

already out here fishing.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.888
- Yeah.

16:03.888 --> 16:04.926
- She's okay.

16:04.926 --> 16:07.860
- Oh come on, we mean you
were checking out her ass.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.010
Listen, I got my friend Amber,

16:10.010 --> 16:12.060
she's gonna come meet us down here,

16:12.060 --> 16:13.310
she's gonna bring one of her friends,

16:13.310 --> 16:16.480
I thought maybe she could introduce you.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.313
- Look at that, there you go.

16:17.313 --> 16:18.146
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:18.146 --> 16:18.979
- Come on.

16:19.930 --> 16:20.763
- I guess.

16:23.730 --> 16:25.860
- Something tells me you're
not remotely interested

16:25.860 --> 16:27.060
in what I just told you.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.753
- Look guys.

16:31.280 --> 16:36.080
Honestly, I don't know
when I'm gonna be back

16:36.080 --> 16:37.403
on track with things.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.260
You gotta remember Catherine and I,

16:40.260 --> 16:42.210
we were together for a long time

16:43.600 --> 16:46.946
and I just don't think I'm over her yet.

16:46.946 --> 16:49.470
- Oh, brother, listen.

16:49.470 --> 16:50.320
If it makes you feel any better,

16:50.320 --> 16:52.500
you don't have to rush into
anything with this girl.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.510
Just talk to her, get to know her

16:54.510 --> 16:55.910
and see where things go from there.

16:55.910 --> 16:57.850
That's it, you're free man now.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.060
- Yeah.

16:59.060 --> 17:04.060
- You think Catherine is at
home crying, hugging her pillow,

17:04.410 --> 17:06.240
thinking about you?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.870
I doubt.

17:07.870 --> 17:09.120
- You're killing me, man.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.240
I need another drink.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.570
Anybody else need-

17:13.570 --> 17:14.403
- I'm still working on this one.

17:14.403 --> 17:15.236
- Good.

17:15.236 --> 17:16.990
- Good.
- Yeah, we're good, thank you.

17:18.642 --> 17:21.725
(indistinct chatter)

17:28.597 --> 17:29.443
- How're you?

17:31.080 --> 17:31.913
- Hi.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.030
- First time here?

17:35.030 --> 17:36.900
- No, I've been here before.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.803
- Oh great, let me get you a drink.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.430
- No, I'm okay.

17:42.430 --> 17:45.750
- No, seriously, let me
get your drink on me.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.563
- Hey, I said fuck off.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.763
(indistinct chatter)

17:55.723 --> 17:57.556
- Dude, what was that?

17:58.450 --> 17:59.680
- Yeah, what happened?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.150
- Honestly, I don't know.

18:02.150 --> 18:06.680
I was being friendly and she blew me off.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.513
- Wow.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.253
- Yeah, fuck me, right?

18:13.110 --> 18:16.860
I'm telling you, the world
is against me right now.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.993
What did I do to deserve this?

18:20.250 --> 18:21.860
- It's not like that man, we your boys,

18:21.860 --> 18:23.250
we got nothing but love for you.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.450
- Yeah, we got your back man.

18:24.450 --> 18:25.960
- Obviously.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.693
- Yeah? Just fuck doesn't feel so.

18:29.530 --> 18:31.810
Like, let me give you a rundown of my day.

18:31.810 --> 18:36.810
First, I get to work late,
my boss is all up my ass.

18:37.210 --> 18:41.930
Then, Ed, Catherine's
brother gets in my face

18:41.930 --> 18:44.910
and accuses me of doing
something to his sister,

18:44.910 --> 18:47.123
when she's the one that dumped me.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.913
I'm telling you this isn't my year.

18:53.310 --> 18:56.703
- Holy shit.

18:59.750 --> 19:00.583
- What?

19:09.220 --> 19:12.140
- Listen, I know what you're thinking,

19:12.140 --> 19:13.520
bro just let this one go.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.710
- It's not worth it, man.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.140
- Just snub.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.010
- Leave it alone.

19:17.010 --> 19:17.843
- I got to-

19:17.843 --> 19:20.032
- No, Dave, Dave don't

19:20.032 --> 19:21.700
- Aah this guy.

19:21.700 --> 19:22.900
- He won't listen to us.

19:24.346 --> 19:27.429
(indistinct chatter)

19:30.161 --> 19:31.730
(Catherine laughing)

19:31.730 --> 19:34.520
- Hey, didn't expect to see you here.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.920
- Dave, what are you doing here?

19:38.920 --> 19:41.320
- I saw you come in and
I thought I'd say hello.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.640
Didn't know you already
seeing somebody new.

19:46.601 --> 19:48.130
- What I do, and who I'm with,

19:48.130 --> 19:50.170
is none of your fucking business.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.390
- Umh, excuse me, who is this guy?

19:52.390 --> 19:53.740
- Really?

19:53.740 --> 19:54.970
Who am I?

19:54.970 --> 19:56.086
Who the are you dude?

19:56.086 --> 19:58.571
- All right, why don't you
just leave us alone, okay?

19:58.571 --> 19:59.404
- Yeah, okay.

19:59.404 --> 20:00.237
- I don't have to explain shit to you.

20:00.237 --> 20:01.453
You are not my father.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.320
- Hey, hey, hey man look

20:04.320 --> 20:05.460

20:05.460 --> 20:06.939
Why don't you do what
she asks and take a walk?

20:06.939 --> 20:09.427
If you don't want the
situation to get ugly.

20:09.427 --> 20:10.409
- What are you saying?

20:10.409 --> 20:11.759
You want take this outside?

20:15.530 --> 20:17.490

20:20.280 --> 20:22.380
- Whoa, whoa take it easy Dave, chill out.

20:23.930 --> 20:26.091
- Control yourself or I'll
throw you the fuck out.

20:26.091 --> 20:27.390
(indistinct chatters)

20:27.390 --> 20:28.490
- Fuck you, dude.

20:28.490 --> 20:29.429

20:49.181 --> 20:50.260

20:50.260 --> 20:51.450
- Yeah.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.540
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

20:53.540 --> 20:54.373

21:00.350 --> 21:01.572
- Really?

21:01.572 --> 21:02.405
- Yeah.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.260
- How dare you say that to me?

21:06.260 --> 21:09.200
I'm offended, I'm genuinely offended.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.140
- You're offended?
- Yeah.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.833
- I should be the one offended.

21:13.730 --> 21:17.700
My ex comes into a bar
that we all hang out at

21:17.700 --> 21:21.090
with a new guy and start shit with me,

21:21.090 --> 21:23.660

21:28.570 --> 21:31.720
- Okay, you know what, Dave?

21:31.720 --> 21:32.793
You need to go home.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.900
You need to go home, you
need clear out your head

21:36.900 --> 21:39.993
because you are clearly going
through some shit right now.

21:42.780 --> 21:44.290
- That's fucked up.

21:44.290 --> 21:45.390
- It's the truth, man.

21:47.679 --> 21:50.096
(dull music)

22:06.780 --> 22:09.530
(car door bangs)

22:14.101 --> 22:17.101

22:18.690 --> 22:21.190

22:47.180 --> 22:49.233
So how long are you looking to stay?

22:51.700 --> 22:53.003

22:58.160 --> 23:00.823

34:45.671 --> 34:48.421
(dramatic music)

34:54.240 --> 34:55.713
I'm calling the police.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.413

you broke up with me?

35:01.560 --> 35:02.393
Because of him.

35:03.385 --> 35:07.070
- That is none of you goddam business.

35:07.070 --> 35:08.533
- I kept thinking to myself,

35:09.510 --> 35:10.663
what did I do?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.863
What did I do?

35:16.440 --> 35:18.390
Now it all makes sense.

35:18.390 --> 35:20.190
It had nothing to do with me at all.

35:22.010 --> 35:23.953
You just wanted to fuck another guy.

35:25.820 --> 35:29.553
- You need to get the
fuck out of my house.

35:29.553 --> 35:30.386
(gun cocks)

35:30.386 --> 35:31.219
Right now.

35:34.755 --> 35:36.523
- How long is it been going on, huh?

35:37.710 --> 35:38.543
You know what?

35:39.420 --> 35:40.533
Doesn't even matter.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.107
I found someone else too.

35:44.893 --> 35:48.993
And I just hope you both
are as happy as I am.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.360
(Catherine gasps)

35:54.360 --> 35:55.667
- Please, leave.

36:01.933 --> 36:04.933
(footsteps tapping)

36:29.578 --> 36:32.821
(dramatic music)

36:32.821 --> 36:34.409
(door knob rattles)

36:34.409 --> 36:37.409
(Catherine sobbing)

36:42.731 --> 36:45.814
(car engine revving)

36:47.921 --> 36:50.671
(car door bangs)

36:53.965 --> 36:56.465
(door knocks)

37:02.445 --> 37:04.945
- Cat, are you all right? Hey.

37:08.175 --> 37:11.092
(Catherine crying)

37:14.320 --> 37:15.603
That son of a bitch.

37:16.750 --> 37:18.730
Hey, listen to me, I'm gonna find him,

37:18.730 --> 37:20.480
make him pay for this, you hear me?

37:23.974 --> 37:24.807
You gon' be okay staying here,

37:24.807 --> 37:27.030
or you want me to take you
to mom and dad's house?

37:27.030 --> 37:28.943
- No, I'll be fine, it's okay.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.333
- Not fine.

37:32.490 --> 37:34.360
Cat I don't feel comfortable
you staying here alone,

37:34.360 --> 37:37.210
knowing that slicker who's
stalking you, I really don't.

37:37.210 --> 37:39.500
- It's okay Ed, I'll be fine.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.600
- So first thing tomorrow morning,

37:40.600 --> 37:41.680
want you go to the police station,

37:41.680 --> 37:43.520
file a restraining order against him.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.353
He can't come into your house like that

37:44.353 --> 37:45.873
and expect to get away with it.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.040
Catherine, look at me.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.750
Promise me you'll go to
the police station tomorrow

37:54.750 --> 37:57.363
and do what I ask you to do, please.

37:59.052 --> 37:59.885
- I promise.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.353
- You my baby sister I don't
want anything to happen to you.

38:06.760 --> 38:07.593
- No.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.950
- Gotta deal with this, okay?

38:10.840 --> 38:12.110
I'll take care of this.

38:23.022 --> 38:25.439
(Dave moans)

38:46.100 --> 38:46.933
- Dave.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.493
Piece of shit.

38:51.166 --> 38:53.666
(dog barking)

38:57.760 --> 39:00.623
Stay the fuck away from
my sister you sick fuck.

39:04.916 --> 39:05.749
(Dave groans)

39:05.749 --> 39:08.249
(dog barking)

39:15.416 --> 39:17.916
(Dave groans)

39:30.870 --> 39:32.790
You think you can bust
into my sister's house

39:32.790 --> 39:35.090
and intimidate her into
getting back with you?

39:36.535 --> 39:37.368
Huh?

39:52.293 --> 39:54.793
(dog barking)

39:56.990 --> 39:57.823
I warned you.

40:06.410 --> 40:10.903
- No, no what the fuck,
these two motherfuckers.

40:14.829 --> 40:17.317
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing?

40:17.317 --> 40:18.900
Get the fuck off him, you gonna kill him,

40:18.900 --> 40:19.947
get outta here.

40:19.947 --> 40:20.780
- That son of a bitch

40:20.780 --> 40:22.815
broke into my sister's
house threatening her.

40:22.815 --> 40:23.648
- [Ross] Get him outta here.

40:23.648 --> 40:25.860
- This ain't over you
dumb fucking sick fuck.

40:25.860 --> 40:27.160
- Go, go, go.
- This aint over.

40:27.160 --> 40:31.413
- Go, go.

40:35.590 --> 40:39.620
- And you, get the fuck
up, get in my office

40:39.620 --> 40:41.543
and clean yourself up now.

40:44.070 --> 40:44.903
Get going.

40:47.420 --> 40:50.420
(footsteps tapping)

41:00.831 --> 41:03.620
Motherfucker, these two motherfuckers.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.540
You're lucky I came out when I did.

41:32.540 --> 41:34.640
'Cause Ed was about to put you in a comma.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.560
Now what the hell is wrong with you?

41:40.560 --> 41:43.000
You can't just go to
people's houses unannounced.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.503
You can't go there unwanted.

41:46.590 --> 41:49.673
- I deserve an explanation, okay?

41:50.940 --> 41:51.870
What am I supposed to do?

41:51.870 --> 41:54.840
His sister went behind my back

41:54.840 --> 41:56.770
and left with some other guy.

41:56.770 --> 41:59.120
I'm supposed to be okay with that?

41:59.120 --> 42:01.820
I'm supposed to just let her
leave and fuck this dude.

42:02.940 --> 42:05.590
- Look, I understand all right?

42:05.590 --> 42:08.340
But you can't make her feel
something that she doesn't.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.100
And you can't just go to people's houses

42:12.100 --> 42:13.930
whenever you want to.

42:13.930 --> 42:15.980
There are other women out there, move on.

42:19.090 --> 42:20.660
- Easy for you to say.

42:20.660 --> 42:21.670
- [Ross] Easy for me to say?

42:21.670 --> 42:24.140
- Realistically that's not the case.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.120
- I know that's not the case.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.460
What is this thing I heard
about you with some dolls,

42:28.460 --> 42:29.490
some sex dolls?

42:29.490 --> 42:31.200
What is that all about?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.210
- Who said that?

42:32.210 --> 42:33.520
Where did you hear that?

42:33.520 --> 42:34.647
- It doesn't matter who said it,

42:34.647 --> 42:36.830
and it doesn't matter where I heard it.

42:36.830 --> 42:38.720
Dave, I got a business to run here,

42:38.720 --> 42:41.910
why do you need to be so
different than everybody else?

42:41.910 --> 42:44.360
What am I gonna do people start
complaining about you here,

42:44.360 --> 42:46.110
and they don't wanna work with you?

42:47.030 --> 42:48.023
- It's fucked up.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.310
- I know it's fucked up,

42:52.310 --> 42:54.660
and that's why you're gonna take week off.

42:54.660 --> 42:57.613
- Ross, I need this job, I need the money.

42:58.990 --> 43:00.330
- Don't worry about the money,

43:00.330 --> 43:02.330
consider it a paid vacation.

43:02.330 --> 43:03.697
Lord knows you need one.

49:22.083 --> 49:24.670
I should've blew it clean off.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.070
Put Ross on the phone.

52:47.070 --> 52:50.060

52:50.060 --> 52:53.860
I took him home and he
got shortness of breath,

52:53.860 --> 52:55.720

he's breathing anymore.

Really?

58:47.166 --> 58:50.287
(Catherine chuckles)

58:50.287 --> 58:52.970
(lips smack)
(Catherine chuckles)

58:52.970 --> 58:56.410
Well, I'm gonna go with the Zinfandel.

58:56.410 --> 58:57.293
- I'll have the same.

58:57.293 --> 58:59.970
- All right, well, I'm gonna
pour these bad boys out

58:59.970 --> 59:01.380
and I'll join you in a few.

59:01.380 --> 59:02.470
- Don't keep me waiting.

59:02.470 --> 59:03.720
- Don't start without me.

59:12.200 --> 59:14.263
So tell me what's this movie about-

59:15.996 --> 59:18.913
(glass shattering)

59:37.370 --> 59:38.203
- Sit down.

59:41.650 --> 59:42.800
- Please don't hurt us.

59:43.981 --> 59:45.331
We'll do whatever you want.

59:52.470 --> 59:53.570
Tell us what you want.

59:55.080 --> 59:56.790
What, is it your money?

59:56.790 --> 59:57.640
What do you want?

59:59.570 --> 1:00:01.793
- Do I look like I want anything from you?

1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:08.270
- I don't understand, why
are you doing all this?

1:00:08.270 --> 1:00:11.330
Please explain to me, what
is your reason for all this?

1:00:11.330 --> 1:00:15.833
- I'm here because this
cunt ruined my life.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:19.200
- Then what do you want to happen now?

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:21.000
If all of this, all of this,

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.800
is because of what Catherine I have,

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:26.770
I'm sorry, I did not know that
you were gonna feel this way

1:00:26.770 --> 1:00:28.283
and I sincerely apologize.

1:00:31.230 --> 1:00:32.680
- I don't need your sympathy.

1:00:34.250 --> 1:00:36.323
I don't need anything from either of you.

1:00:39.130 --> 1:00:43.233
I want you to feel the way I feel.

1:00:44.550 --> 1:00:49.550
I want you both to suffer
the way I suffer every day.

1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:57.980
Do know what it's like
waking up every day,

1:00:58.450 --> 1:01:02.954
and realizing that
nothing is in your favor?

1:01:02.954 --> 1:01:04.180
(Dave chuckles)

1:01:04.180 --> 1:01:07.123
No, you wouldn't.

1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:09.550
Because you're too wrapped up

1:01:09.550 --> 1:01:11.610
in your pretty little lives.

1:01:11.610 --> 1:01:13.173
- You made your point.

1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:17.553
Now why don't you just leave us alone?

1:01:19.180 --> 1:01:20.130
- What was that?

1:01:20.130 --> 1:01:20.993
Say that again.

1:01:23.650 --> 1:01:28.650
- I said leave us alone.

1:01:30.730 --> 1:01:34.623
- Okay, I'll leave you alone.

1:01:35.790 --> 1:01:37.090
I've no problem with that.

1:01:42.740 --> 1:01:44.231
But not until he dies first.

1:01:44.231 --> 1:01:45.064
- No!
(gunshot bangs)

1:01:45.064 --> 1:01:47.231
(beeping)

1:02:02.155 --> 1:02:04.738
(somber music)

1:03:02.827 --> 1:03:05.494
(gunshot bangs)

1:03:19.670 --> 1:03:21.170
- Please, help me.

1:03:29.454 --> 1:03:30.830
(gunshot bangs)

1:03:30.830 --> 1:03:31.703
- I love you.

1:03:41.067 --> 1:03:43.734
(Dave laughing)

1:03:59.197 --> 1:04:00.609
I love you.
