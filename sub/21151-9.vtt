WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:06.360
ANNOUNCER: Previously on "Big
Brother," with the sniper

00:06.360 --> 00:07.680
in the line of fire.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.530
I know you wanted to
battle it out with me

00:09.530 --> 00:10.860
but I'm more of a
checkmate kind of guy.

00:10.860 --> 00:12.810
So Cody, hop on over, bud.

00:12.810 --> 00:14.250
Respect.

00:14.250 --> 00:17.640
ANNOUNCER: He worried he was
leaving Jess in a bad spot.

00:17.640 --> 00:20.070
I feel really bad for
her, everything that she's

00:20.070 --> 00:23.280
had to go through in this game.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.620
At this point, all we can
do is salvage her name.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.030
ANNOUNCER: So he
decided to throw

00:27.030 --> 00:28.830
some people under the bus.

00:28.830 --> 00:36.110
Two

00:36.110 --> 00:39.570
Having some fun, Dominique
interviewed the nominees.

00:39.570 --> 00:45.000
There were
organically-forming teams.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.230
ANNOUNCER: Where Cody
continued to stir the pot.

00:48.230 --> 00:51.140
There was at least one or
two people always involved.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.940
One or two people
in which decision?

00:52.940 --> 00:55.820
That's all I'm saying, Mark.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.830
ANNOUNCER: Mark was
mad at the Marine.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.810
For whatever reason, I think
he'd be a man of his word

00:59.810 --> 01:01.550
and actually go out like a man.

01:01.550 --> 01:03.650
ANNOUNCER: But it was
Dominique the Dominator

01:03.650 --> 01:05.330
who caught Paul's ire.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.730
Dom referring to us
as an organic group,

01:07.730 --> 01:09.910
why would you even go down
that line of questioning?

01:09.910 --> 01:11.390
I have no idea what
that was all about.

01:11.390 --> 01:14.030
That was not OK.

01:14.030 --> 01:17.240
ANNOUNCER: And he was intent
on making her a future target.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.300
Look Dominic, if you
keep going down this path,

01:20.300 --> 01:23.630
you might just be on the
opposite end of a hosting show.

01:23.630 --> 01:27.990
AKA, the exit interview
with Julie Chen.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.380
JULIE CHEN : With
Christmas breaking her foot.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.340
- Oh my God.
- Don't touch it.

01:32.340 --> 01:33.850
Don't touch it.

01:33.850 --> 01:37.830
I know my body so well,
something's seriously wrong.

01:37.830 --> 01:40.470
ANNOUNCER: She had to decide
whether to stay in the house

01:40.470 --> 01:41.850
or leave the game.

01:41.850 --> 01:45.120
I now have officially been
told that I will need surgery.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.630
Knowing all of
this, my decision is

01:49.630 --> 01:52.060
to continue to be the
queen of perseverance

01:52.060 --> 01:57.300
and stay in the
"Big Brother" house.

01:57.300 --> 02:01.750
ANNOUNCER: At the live eviction,
three voted to take out Ramses.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.000
- I vote to evict Ramses.
- Ramses.

02:04.000 --> 02:04.900
Ramses.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.490
ANNOUNCER: Yet it
wasn't enough to save

02:06.490 --> 02:08.920
the Marine from going AWOL.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.330
JULIE CHEN: By a vote
of seven to three, Cody,

02:13.330 --> 02:15.100
you have been evicted from
the "Big Brother" house.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.120
ANNOUNCER: But Julie teased
a possible return to action.

02:22.120 --> 02:25.790
JULIE CHEN: You, Cameron,
Jillian, and next week evictee

02:25.790 --> 02:31.050
will get a chance to battle
back your way into the game.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.520
You game?

02:33.520 --> 02:36.170
I see revenge in those eyes.

02:36.170 --> 02:38.990
ANNOUNCER: With the head of
household back up for grabs,

02:38.990 --> 02:43.070
the house guests began an
intergalactic battle for power.

02:43.070 --> 02:46.400
Who will return to earth
the victor and which space

02:46.400 --> 02:49.790
cadets will be targeted next?

02:49.790 --> 02:53.780
Find out right now
on "Big Brother."

02:53.780 --> 02:56.880
Let's hear it
from the audience.

03:37.620 --> 03:40.590
JULIE CHEN: This
competition starts now.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.140
I really can't breathe.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.430
Even though Cody is
out of the house,

03:55.430 --> 03:58.490
it is still vitally
important that me and my side

03:58.490 --> 03:59.750
of the house remain safe.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.660
So that means I need
either me, Matt,

04:02.660 --> 04:05.390
Mark, Raven, or
Dominique to win HOH

04:05.390 --> 04:08.490
to get Jessica out this week.

04:08.490 --> 04:11.640
The only person in this
entire game that I trust just

04:11.640 --> 04:13.960
walked out the door.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.070
So this HOH comp
is purely up to me.

04:17.070 --> 04:19.800
I need to be the last
space person standing,

04:19.800 --> 04:22.120
otherwise I'm going to go
on the block this week.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.750
My bra absorbed
all of that water.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.190
My ass is clamped
shut like a bear trap.

04:33.590 --> 04:35.570
All that time
getting pretty, girls.

04:35.570 --> 04:38.480
Good news is, I got the biggest
target out of this game.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.100
Bad news is, this is
my last week of safety

04:41.100 --> 04:42.630
and I might be the next target.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.460
No matter who the
next HOH is, I've

04:44.460 --> 04:46.080
got to pull some tricks
out of my sleeves

04:46.080 --> 04:47.370
and create some new targets.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.450
Good thing for me, the Marine
that I just shipped off

04:50.450 --> 04:53.850
left me with some ammunition.

04:53.850 --> 04:55.550
I went to Mark.

04:55.550 --> 04:57.900
I said, I can back
Paul this week.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.770
So he knew about it.

05:02.100 --> 05:06.230
Thick as thieves, off to
the side all the time.

05:06.230 --> 05:09.170
So according to Cody,
Mark and Dominique knew

05:09.170 --> 05:10.910
about his plan to put me up.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.160
I got to cause some chaos
to look out for myself

05:13.160 --> 05:15.330
long term in this game.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.990
People better start dropping.

05:17.990 --> 05:23.330
Meatballs better
start flying baby.

05:23.330 --> 05:24.640
I just survived the block.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.130
If I'm going to win HOH,
this is the week to do it.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.570
I need to pull out
this win right now.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.070
Oh it's in my mouth.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.540
Oh boy.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.680
As soon as I'm up
on that wall, I know

05:38.680 --> 05:40.730
this is not competition for me.

05:40.730 --> 05:42.800
The incline of this is crazy.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.710
It feels like I'm
parallel with the ground.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.200
My feet start to
hurt and my legs

05:47.200 --> 05:51.970
are shaking because the freezing
water so I'm screwed right now.

05:51.970 --> 05:55.000
It's not going
to get any better.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.260
Nothing in his game gets better.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.630
This has to be the most
intense competition I've

06:03.630 --> 06:06.120
ever competed in in this house.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.850
The water's freezing, I'm
trembling, losing control.

06:09.850 --> 06:11.440
Well, all I know is
that I need this HOH.

06:18.140 --> 06:21.740
Josh is floating through
space like a meatball.

06:21.740 --> 06:23.300
I lose grip and I fall.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.360
First person down
completely sucks.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.180
I thought I would last
a little bit longer.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.220
- That was hard.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.460
Relax, ,,
take a deep breath.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.910
Oh my God.

06:45.910 --> 06:48.650
I'm really trying to figure
out how to grip my hand

06:48.650 --> 06:50.730
and it is not working
and I'm shaking

06:50.730 --> 06:53.030
and my left side is giving
out and my right arm

06:53.030 --> 06:53.990
can't even grip it.

06:59.770 --> 07:04.150
And now Mark is lost in space.

07:04.150 --> 07:08.140
Hey guys, it looks like
there's some aliens.

07:08.140 --> 07:11.140
Oh my God.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.760
What did I have to get hit?

07:12.760 --> 07:14.540
It matches my shoes.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.480
I've always
wanted to be slimed.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.450
Aliens are coming back.

07:20.810 --> 07:21.740
Woo.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.080
Hey, is there one
around my forehead?

07:23.080 --> 07:24.620
Look at my forehead.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.520
I don't have many
allies in this house

07:26.520 --> 07:29.200
but I do have a lot of
try and a bull rider grip

07:29.200 --> 07:30.820
and I do not quit.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.490
Is this stuff edible?

07:32.490 --> 07:33.480
This space goo?

07:49.610 --> 07:50.930
I'm asking Mark
about the votes

07:50.930 --> 07:53.360
but little does he know,
I know all about it

07:53.360 --> 07:55.940
because I pretty
much orchestrated it.

07:55.940 --> 08:00.380
I need you do me a favor,
during the vote this week,

08:00.380 --> 08:03.700
I need you to vote
to evict Ramses.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.870
And nobody's going to
suspected it's you.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.180
Does anyone else know
you're asking me this?

08:13.180 --> 08:15.130
No, that's the whole point.

08:15.130 --> 08:19.000
Trust me, if you do this, you
will see the chaos unfold.

08:19.000 --> 08:19.990
No problem.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.140
You ain't got to say no more.

08:30.180 --> 08:30.880
Think about that.

08:38.240 --> 08:42.660
I am hanging on this wall
for dear life, trembling,

08:42.660 --> 08:46.380
my body is screaming, my
glutes and flukes are aching.

08:46.380 --> 08:47.820
Someone please help me.

08:53.990 --> 08:54.690
It's OK.

08:54.690 --> 08:57.570
And Raven has
fallen from the sky.

09:03.330 --> 09:04.530
Tricky.
Tricky.

09:11.980 --> 09:13.470
It's really cold.

09:26.690 --> 09:27.390
Yeah.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.370
No.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.450
The consistency on my face.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.780
What's screwing
me up is this goo.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.280
I'm trying to figure
out a different way

09:41.280 --> 09:47.130
to reposition my hands because
this goo is all over the place.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.880
And there goes Ramses.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.950
Nice Ramses.

09:50.950 --> 09:51.970
Good job, buddy.

09:51.970 --> 09:54.120
Nice try, pal.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.680
I can't believe I fell.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.990
I could have been on that
wall for so much longer

09:57.990 --> 09:59.820
but that goo messed me up.

09:59.820 --> 10:04.950
At this point, I'm just praying
that either Jason or Alex pull

10:04.950 --> 10:07.440
through for this competition
because I cannot trust

10:07.440 --> 10:08.820
anyone else in this house.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.210
The slime makes it about
10 times harder to hold on.

10:23.150 --> 10:26.100
Wow.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.360
My arm's cramping too much.

10:30.490 --> 10:31.190
Whoa.

10:37.390 --> 10:39.090
- Way to push, baby.

10:39.090 --> 10:43.410
And Kevin has
checked out of space.

10:43.410 --> 10:48.250
We've got Jason, Dominic,
Jessica, Elena, Alex, and Matt

10:48.250 --> 10:50.680
left up on the space wall.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.620
Looks like this
might last a few light years.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.780
Every time the water turns
on, I go to my happy place.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.530
I know if Cody's
out there watching,

11:12.530 --> 11:14.680
then he's definitely
proud of me and I'm just

11:14.680 --> 11:16.240
holding on to that thought.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.740
Every time I think
about anything endurance

11:17.740 --> 11:21.950
or running-wise, what I do is
I put a family member dying

11:21.950 --> 11:25.060
at the finish line and
the only way to save

11:25.060 --> 11:26.260
is if I get there first.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.500
I know.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.060
Hold it.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.100
My only goal is
to stay on here

11:48.100 --> 11:49.720
at least longer than Jessica.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.560
If Jess wins this
competition, she

11:54.560 --> 11:56.900
would definitely probably
do something that would

11:56.900 --> 11:57.980
target somebody in our group.

12:05.530 --> 12:07.510
Looks like Matt has
dropped out of space.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.520
Cowboy, you're the
last man standing.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.540
Yeah.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.720
Space cowboy.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.520
Jessica is a
threat to our team.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.240
I cannot fall off this wall
as long as Jessica is up here.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.860
Oh no.

12:28.860 --> 12:31.290
My body is freezing up here.

12:31.290 --> 12:34.090
I'm losing feeling in
my hands and my feet

12:34.090 --> 12:37.380
but it just doesn't matter,
I have to hold onto this wall

12:37.380 --> 12:38.960
or I'm going to
go home this week.

12:42.910 --> 12:44.390
Shoot, really?

12:48.140 --> 12:48.840
I'm pissed.

13:00.210 --> 13:03.790
So I fall and I'm really
disappointed in myself.

13:03.790 --> 13:05.370
I feel like I let Cody down.

13:05.370 --> 13:08.610
I really wanted to get
revenge and it sucks.

13:12.650 --> 13:15.470
Jessica's down and
I'm like, oh yeah.

13:15.470 --> 13:20.190
My team and I, we're safe
for the rest of the week.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.750
It looks like
Jessica and Dominic

13:26.750 --> 13:28.640
have both left the orbit.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.670
We're down to Jason,
Elena, and Alex.

13:34.790 --> 13:36.090
How much you love me?

13:36.090 --> 13:37.890
How much do I love you?

13:37.890 --> 13:39.610
Oh, I love you a
whole hell of a lot.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.590
How much do you love me?

13:40.590 --> 13:41.780
I love you a
whole hell of a lot.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.480
I bet you do.

13:45.860 --> 13:50.020
Are you trying to make
a deal with me, Jason?

13:50.020 --> 13:51.500
Yeah let's make some deals.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.870
I'm so tired, my legs
are shaking, I'm freezing.

13:53.870 --> 13:56.360
I want to get off this
thing so let's make a deal.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.880
Honestly, dude, I literally
could sit here for the rest

13:58.880 --> 14:00.340
of the night, so--

14:00.340 --> 14:01.670
You're going to
have to prove it.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.230
All right, let's hang out.

14:06.060 --> 14:07.090
Oh man.

14:16.330 --> 14:20.720
My feet, my arms, my legs,
everything is killing me.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.630
But I'm going to stay on this
thing till my hands fall off,

14:23.630 --> 14:24.530
which might happen.

14:40.930 --> 14:45.650
It's now down to
Jason, Elena, and Alex.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.370
Good game, guys.

14:47.370 --> 14:48.750
Elena and Alex, good job.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.360
Nice, Elena, way
to push it girl.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.640
Elena's kicking ass up
there so I hope she can hang

14:53.640 --> 14:55.710
on a little longer
and win this HOH

14:55.710 --> 14:57.150
and keep the power on our side.

14:59.830 --> 15:02.550
I can't feel my left foot.

15:02.550 --> 15:04.920
Right now, it's
me, Alex, and Elena.

15:04.920 --> 15:09.100
I've got some pain in my
hands and some pain in my feet

15:09.100 --> 15:13.290
but I know Alex isn't going
to do anything to jeopardize

15:13.290 --> 15:16.230
either one of us but I
can't trust Elena so I

15:16.230 --> 15:19.030
have to stay here on this wall.

15:19.030 --> 15:20.020
Go Alex.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.420
What up?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.350
Good job, Elena, good job.

15:22.350 --> 15:23.840
Good job, good job, good job.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.320
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

15:28.300 --> 15:29.520
Oh no, oh no.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.530
I feel like I've
been up here all night

15:47.530 --> 15:50.710
but I need to get it together,
I need to get in game mode.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.350
I'm literally saying all
these Hail Marys because I

15:53.350 --> 15:54.800
need to win this competition.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.340
If I don't, I could be back
on the block for a third time.

15:57.340 --> 16:01.820
Keep going, keep that
prayers, Hail some Marys.

16:01.820 --> 16:02.790
Oh jeez.

16:26.730 --> 16:28.640
Oh, boy.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.510
Good job, guys, good job.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.630
You guys want to make a deal?

16:36.630 --> 16:38.570
Let's talk.

16:38.570 --> 16:41.920
If you both fall
off, I'll be HOH.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.150
Oh my God.

16:43.150 --> 16:44.020
What a deal.

16:47.550 --> 16:49.910
Ain't nobody on
this wall going home.

16:49.910 --> 16:50.820
OK.

16:50.820 --> 16:53.330
We won't put any of us
on the block, agreed.

16:53.330 --> 16:54.660
Sure.

16:54.660 --> 16:57.050
I feel pretty confident
that if I drop now,

16:57.050 --> 16:58.110
then Elena will drop.

16:58.110 --> 17:00.500
Because I feel like the only
reason Elena's up there is cus

17:00.500 --> 17:01.320
I'm up there.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.860
I want Al to win anyway so I
might as well kick this chicken

17:05.860 --> 17:08.270
and just get it roll.

17:08.270 --> 17:10.720
- Swear.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.200
I swear.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.160
And Jason is off the wall.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.710
It is now down to
Elena and Alex.

17:17.710 --> 17:19.810
You two girls battle it out.

17:19.810 --> 17:21.350
So it's down to
Alex and Elena.

17:21.350 --> 17:22.920
I really hope Elena
pulls this off

17:22.920 --> 17:24.690
because that will
absolutely ensure

17:24.690 --> 17:26.220
that me and everyone
in my group is

17:26.220 --> 17:28.810
safe going forward this week.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.750
You're not my target.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.850
I swear, I swear, I swear.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.170
Swear.
I swear to God.

17:38.570 --> 17:39.710
OK, I'll jump.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.560
I can hang on a
little bit longer

17:41.560 --> 17:46.620
but I know that the whole
house wants Jess out

17:46.620 --> 17:49.970
and I could give Alex
this HOH and let her take

17:49.970 --> 17:53.930
that shot if she guarantees
me and a few people safety

17:53.930 --> 17:54.930
and not get blood on my hands.

17:57.820 --> 17:58.520
Yes.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.560
Wait, wait, wait,
whoa, sorry, sorry, bro.

18:19.490 --> 18:24.670
Congratulations Alex,
you are the new HOH.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.780
don't hug me because you're
dirty, but a high five.

18:27.780 --> 18:30.010
I won HOH I'm feeling great.

18:30.010 --> 18:31.670
I've cashed checks
and broke neck.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.090
Literally, it hurt.

18:36.010 --> 18:38.530
I'm going to go down because
I literally can't feel my legs.

18:38.530 --> 18:41.050
I'm so happy that Alex is HOH.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.880
I know I'll be safe
this week so let's

18:42.880 --> 18:44.560
put someone up from
the other side and even

18:44.560 --> 18:47.320
out those numbers.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.830
Alex wins HOH and I'm not
that thrilled because I have

18:50.830 --> 18:52.010
no idea what she's going to do.

18:52.010 --> 18:54.550
But Elena made a deal up
there so hopefully my safety

18:54.550 --> 18:56.650
was involved.

18:56.650 --> 19:00.520
Alex won HOH and
whoop-de-doo for her.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.400
If Alex is smart, she'll
realize that my only ally

19:03.400 --> 19:07.180
left this week so putting
me up is a mute point.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.640
Get somebody else out of this
house and let's shake things

19:09.640 --> 19:10.340
up.

19:19.230 --> 19:20.120
Come on baby.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.670
Good job, everybody.

19:21.670 --> 19:22.490
Good job, guys.

19:22.490 --> 19:23.220
Good job, I mean it.

19:23.220 --> 19:24.620
Good show, everybody.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.780
I finally have the power
but I need to make sure

19:35.780 --> 19:38.210
that I don't step on
toes and make sure I

19:38.210 --> 19:40.600
get people to stay loyal to me.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.760
Yo great job.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.380
I'm super excited that Alex won
HOH because over the past week,

19:47.380 --> 19:50.430
her and I have been trying to
work together super low key.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.910
We can be teammates
but be playing

19:52.910 --> 19:54.700
a totally different game.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.710
I want to work with you.

19:56.710 --> 19:59.800
Now that she's HOH, we can
finally strengthen this bond

19:59.800 --> 20:01.520
and get to some serious work.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.050
So the plan remains?

20:03.050 --> 20:04.450
- Yeah.
- Cool.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.350
Let's talk though.

20:05.350 --> 20:06.050
OK.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.230
Listen, people betrayed us.

20:14.230 --> 20:18.370
If I stay in this game, I
want revenge on everyone that

20:18.370 --> 20:19.960
stabbed Cody and I in the back.

20:23.090 --> 20:26.860
Alex needs to know that
after everything that happened

20:26.860 --> 20:29.960
this past week, I would
never come after you,

20:29.960 --> 20:32.510
I would never come after her.

20:32.510 --> 20:36.310
Alex and I do not have to
be best friends but if we are

20:36.310 --> 20:38.530
going to move
forward in this game,

20:38.530 --> 20:43.490
we need to unify
all of the floaters

20:43.490 --> 20:45.580
to take out the other
side of the house

20:45.580 --> 20:49.730
or guess what, I might be this
week but she could be next.

20:49.730 --> 20:52.120
If she wants to send me
home then I'll go home.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.170
But it's a dumb
game move for her.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.270
And she's the type
of person that

20:55.270 --> 20:57.220
wants to leave a
mark on this game

20:57.220 --> 20:58.940
and she's not leaving
a mark on this game

20:58.940 --> 21:01.540
by evicting someone
who has zero allies.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.100
Exactly.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.470
They're just going
to use her as a puppet

21:05.470 --> 21:07.940
to do their dirty work.

21:07.940 --> 21:10.180
She's at the bottom
of their totem pole.

21:10.180 --> 21:10.880
We all are.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.490
Now that Cody is
out of the house,

21:12.490 --> 21:14.700
Jessica is totally
by herself which

21:14.700 --> 21:20.140
would you be a good ally
for us because she's already

21:20.140 --> 21:22.930
capsized her ship over
there, she's totally alone

21:22.930 --> 21:24.700
and I believe in her.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.360
I'm thinking this
is going to work.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.440
I would love to see
some of the alliances

21:32.440 --> 21:34.230
in this house broken up.

21:34.230 --> 21:35.640
Matt and Dominique.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.180
That'd be the smartest move.

21:41.180 --> 21:43.420
I want to go after Matt
because I don't really

21:43.420 --> 21:45.420
have that close of a personal
relationship with him

21:45.420 --> 21:46.420
and he's part of a show-mance.

21:46.420 --> 21:51.130
Max I want to go after
Dominique because she's

21:51.130 --> 21:53.110
tied in with the
show-mances and she's

21:53.110 --> 21:56.520
got a real good social game
that keeps weaving all of them

21:56.520 --> 21:57.220
together.

21:57.220 --> 22:00.560
If Alex wants to make a
really good move for HOH,

22:00.560 --> 22:02.740
Matt's definitely one of them.

22:02.740 --> 22:04.330
- Yo.

22:04.330 --> 22:05.970
Hey what's up?

22:05.970 --> 22:07.660
Nothing.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.870
You all right, bro?

22:08.870 --> 22:10.320
- Yeah.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.690
I'm going to do
it on this deal.

22:16.690 --> 22:17.920
I'm going to figure it out.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.470
Damn it that was not cowboy.

22:33.450 --> 22:35.020
I don't know, I bet she did.

22:52.180 --> 22:54.790
We've got Jessica here and if
you don't put her on the block,

22:54.790 --> 22:57.100
then she'll be a
number for our side.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.410
So we can put somebody
else on the block

22:59.410 --> 23:02.370
and really get them scrambling.

23:02.370 --> 23:03.780
come in here.

23:03.780 --> 23:07.990
It's your HOH, girl,
use it, don't squander it.

23:12.470 --> 23:14.530
I mean, me and Elena made a
deal, if she says you're safe,

23:14.530 --> 23:15.230
then you're safe.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.670
Oh.

23:19.670 --> 23:20.750
Yeah sorry, bro.

23:20.750 --> 23:21.730
I could be in trouble.

23:21.730 --> 23:24.960
If she says you're
safe, you're safe.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.150
I'm a little
worrisome because I

23:26.150 --> 23:28.090
was kind of hoping for a
little comfort from Alex

23:28.090 --> 23:29.930
saying I was safe but
that's not what I got.

23:35.630 --> 23:37.650
At this point, I feel like
my future in this house

23:37.650 --> 23:39.830
rests in the deal that
Elena made up there.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.180
Jessica has to
be on the block.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.220
We can back door,
someone that's fine,

23:52.220 --> 23:54.370
but she has to be on the block.

23:54.370 --> 23:55.460
Do you understand?

24:10.790 --> 24:14.530
If we the house right now,
you will be by yourself.

24:29.490 --> 24:30.980
I understand.
I don't like it.

24:49.370 --> 24:54.090
Oh I wish I were the HOH.

24:54.090 --> 24:56.720
Alex is HOH now and I
want to make sure that I

24:56.720 --> 24:58.250
decide who her target is.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.750
I don't really
care about Jessica

24:59.750 --> 25:00.920
because she's all alone.

25:00.920 --> 25:04.640
Josh is crazy and he seems to
somehow just trust me more out

25:04.640 --> 25:05.960
of anybody else in this house.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.540
I know Alex isn't going to
target Jason and Ramses so that

25:08.540 --> 25:10.580
means the target
this week has to come

25:10.580 --> 25:12.050
from my side of the house.

25:12.050 --> 25:14.630
Step one, I've got
to meet with the HOH

25:14.630 --> 25:17.270
and make sure that she
knows that Mark and Dom are

25:17.270 --> 25:19.200
a little bit sketchy.

25:19.200 --> 25:23.740
OK, so check this out, Cody
told me it was Mark and Dom.

25:23.740 --> 25:25.750
They do have an alliance.

25:25.750 --> 25:26.490
Because--

25:26.490 --> 25:29.100
from day one,
they've been hanging out.

25:29.100 --> 25:32.800
Dominique and Mark are--

25:32.800 --> 25:35.040
this is perfect for you
and I to keep this boiling.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.990
Step two, tell
Mark and Dominique

25:39.990 --> 25:42.300
exactly what Cody
said about them

25:42.300 --> 25:43.940
and get them a little paranoid.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.960
Hey Mark, come here.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.970
So I didn't want to see
this while Cody was here

25:47.970 --> 25:50.790
because I didn't want anything
weird to happen with the vote

25:50.790 --> 25:53.000
but it turns out it would
have happened anyway.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.610
The two people you mentioned
to me were you and Dominique.

25:57.610 --> 26:03.040
We live in the BB house and
paranoia grows by the second.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.750
I don't believe it
or else I would not

26:04.750 --> 26:06.510
be having this conversation
with either of you.

26:06.510 --> 26:09.250
This stays here.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.040
This is my last week of safety
from dependent of protection

26:12.040 --> 26:15.070
so I've got to make sure that I
use this week to my advantage,

26:15.070 --> 26:18.490
create all sorts of pandemonium
so that in the next few weeks

26:18.490 --> 26:20.950
when I'm no longer safe,
maybe nobody's really

26:20.950 --> 26:22.570
looking in my
direction and they're

26:22.570 --> 26:23.980
just eating each other alive.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.890
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

26:31.890 --> 26:32.710
You're welcome.

26:32.710 --> 26:35.450
What do we want to do?

26:35.450 --> 26:37.260
During the HOH
competition, Elena and I

26:37.260 --> 26:40.080
made a deal that I would
keep her and her people safe.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.550
Right now we need to
sit down and figure

26:41.550 --> 26:43.290
out who those people are.

26:43.290 --> 26:46.320
This is your HOH, obviously.

26:46.320 --> 26:50.820
The only thing that
I want to protect

26:50.820 --> 26:58.220
is Mark, Raven, Matt,
Dominique, and Paul I want safe.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.090
That's a lot of
people to protect.

27:00.090 --> 27:02.310
I need to find a way to make
Elena feel comfortable putting

27:02.310 --> 27:03.530
up one of her own on the block.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.390
Come on.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.810
What's up?

27:14.810 --> 27:17.390
I told her I was going
to protect her group

27:17.390 --> 27:20.210
but the only concerns that I see
are there are a couple people

27:20.210 --> 27:21.970
that are red flags for me.

27:21.970 --> 27:25.000
Dominique and Mark right now.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.220
Obviously, I'm not
going to endorse that.

27:28.220 --> 27:30.200
Mark can't go up.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.600
Obviously, this is
not our agreement.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.690
Obviously, I'm not OK with
Mark being on the block.

27:35.690 --> 27:37.460
I'm never going to say,
you have my blessing.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.380
We're just looking for
people to put up right now,

27:39.380 --> 27:40.170
you know what I mean?

27:40.170 --> 27:44.470
Jessica's most
likely on the block.

27:44.470 --> 27:47.360
But alongside her, we need
to have another person.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.130
After talking with
Alex, I'm pretty

27:49.130 --> 27:51.550
hopeful that Dominique and
Mark are not going on the block

27:51.550 --> 27:52.900
this week.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.290
I'm leaving.

27:54.290 --> 27:55.880
Y'all probably want
to talk for a minute.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.790
As long as Alex
sticks to our deal,

27:57.790 --> 27:59.000
everything's going to be great.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.860
OK so here's your options.

28:16.210 --> 28:22.900
Dom and Mark are definitely
up to something, 1000%.

28:22.900 --> 28:26.100
This is your choice, you
draw that line in the sand

28:26.100 --> 28:27.930
and take a serious
shot because there

28:27.930 --> 28:30.140
is definitely something up.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.950
I'm thinking about long
term because we have-- like,

28:32.950 --> 28:35.280
we all realistically eight of
us can't make it to the finals,

28:35.280 --> 28:35.820
right?
- I know.

28:35.820 --> 28:37.820
So we have to draw a line now
before everyone's too strong

28:37.820 --> 28:38.790
and set in their ways.

28:38.790 --> 28:40.500
I think we should put Mark up.

28:40.500 --> 28:43.350
Out of the two, I definitely
think Mark is up to something

28:43.350 --> 28:46.070
shady but he has a
bum finger and he's

28:46.070 --> 28:47.150
not that good at competing.

28:47.150 --> 28:48.920
Dominique obviously showed
she's a good competitor.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.660
- Dom's smart.
- Yes.

28:58.050 --> 29:00.190
I would rather target
Dom first before Mark

29:00.190 --> 29:01.740
because, honestly,
I think Dominique

29:01.740 --> 29:04.900
is more of a competitor and
more of a threat in this game.

29:04.900 --> 29:08.430
Also, her little talk show
gig, look, bud, I'm on to you,

29:08.430 --> 29:10.530
you're doing this to get
some more information

29:10.530 --> 29:12.420
for your own personal game.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.610
I'm smelling it and
I don't like it.

29:14.610 --> 29:16.260
Maybe Dominique.

29:16.260 --> 29:18.110
I think Dom is the best one.

29:18.110 --> 29:20.930
OK, if she pulls herself down
for whatever reason, it's Mark.

29:29.540 --> 29:31.410
Young man.

29:31.410 --> 29:33.240
Wow,  Kevin.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.160
Smell that.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.080
Smell that.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.090
Smelling delicious,
like clean clothes.

29:37.090 --> 29:38.290
No, no, no, that's
your bed sheet.

29:38.290 --> 29:39.190
Close that dryer, please.

29:39.190 --> 29:39.990
Close the dryer?

29:39.990 --> 29:42.440
Sure, sure, it's a good idea.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.760
Did you just kick
the dryer closed?

29:43.760 --> 29:44.590
Yes, Kevin.

29:44.590 --> 29:46.540
What the hell you
trying to do, break it?

29:46.540 --> 29:47.570
Why would you kick it closed?

29:47.570 --> 29:48.800
I mean, you're right
there, walk over

29:48.800 --> 29:50.690
and  with your hand.

29:50.690 --> 29:53.800
Have to start changing these
mannerisms of yours

29:55.670 --> 29:57.650
Kevin is honestly
my dad inside

29:57.650 --> 29:59.060
of this "Big Brother" house.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.070
He yells at me.

30:00.070 --> 30:01.640
What about putting your
hand over your mouth.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.020
- Excuse me.

30:03.020 --> 30:04.610
Unbelievable, this kid.

30:04.610 --> 30:06.170
I'm taking Ramses under my wing.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.340
I don't know what
I'm going to do--

30:07.340 --> 30:09.110
I didn't sneeze,
Kevin, I burped.

30:09.110 --> 30:11.720
He needs a role model,
someone to show him about life.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.200
Are you going to make the bed?

30:14.200 --> 30:15.550
Teach him a thing or two.

30:15.550 --> 30:16.850
You know saying,
don't drink the water?

30:16.850 --> 30:17.550
Uh-huh.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.940
Montezuma, he was
a god of Mexico,

30:19.940 --> 30:21.930
and they would call it
Montezuma's revenge for all

30:21.930 --> 30:22.970
the people coming there.

30:22.970 --> 30:24.470
all over the place.

30:24.470 --> 30:25.840
Kevin, what should I do?

30:25.840 --> 30:29.710
Put some balls in the
pockets when he's not looking.

30:29.710 --> 30:33.590
Kevin teaches me history,
he teaches me street smarts.

30:33.590 --> 30:36.140
What happens if you get in
a ball that's not yours?

30:36.140 --> 30:38.270
The other guy shakes
your hand, buys you a drink

30:38.270 --> 30:39.560
or hits you with a pool stick.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.310
Even self-defense.

30:41.310 --> 30:42.980
This is the stick part
you hit the people with.

30:42.980 --> 30:43.680
So that part hits.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.850
What are you going
to do with this?

30:44.850 --> 30:45.950
Poke them right in the eye.

30:45.950 --> 30:48.930
Listen, Ramses looks up to me,
he has no choice, he's 5' 10",

30:48.930 --> 30:49.630
I'm 6' 3".

30:49.630 --> 30:53.990
Ramses, I say, before, we
leave we smash those glass.

30:53.990 --> 30:55.730
Take the counterfeit
bills to a liquor store

30:55.730 --> 30:58.160
10 minutes before the liquor
store closes when it's

30:58.160 --> 31:00.620
such a rush that they don't read
the bills, they just take it

31:00.620 --> 31:01.700
and go.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.250
I'd really like to
have him come over

31:03.250 --> 31:04.640
to my house for Thanksgiving.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.270
Thanksgiving in the
east is a big deal.

31:07.270 --> 31:08.760
Here, handsome.
Hold on, here.

31:08.760 --> 31:09.460
Thank you.

31:09.460 --> 31:10.960
This is much harder
than I thought.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.690
Yes, sir.

31:11.690 --> 31:12.590
Thank you, sir.

31:12.590 --> 31:14.930
You are going to be
snug like a bug in a rug.

31:14.930 --> 31:17.390
Look, right here, pinky promise.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.170
We still have
a long way to go.

31:22.170 --> 31:23.620
But I love the kid.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.880
And act like a
gentleman, you hear me?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.210
OK.

31:27.210 --> 31:28.140
Get some sleep, Goofy.

31:38.030 --> 31:44.370
VOICEOVER: Jason, Jessica,
please return to the den

31:44.370 --> 32:09.550
of temptation and

32:09.550 --> 32:10.530
Yeah freedom.

32:10.530 --> 32:12.910
- Yeah,
- Wahoo.

32:16.220 --> 32:18.910
I am so happy to be
out of that toad costume.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.500
Last week was really
tough on me and I never

32:24.500 --> 32:27.820
want to see another toad
or lily pad ever again.

32:27.820 --> 32:31.440
I'm done, I am free,
let freedom ring.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.380
I can sit in a chair.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.340
This is an emotional moment.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.680
Raven.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.610
Even in your relaxed pose
you're very aware of your body

32:49.610 --> 32:52.200
like .
Even in your relaxed poses.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.050
Hang on, hang on.

32:54.050 --> 32:55.260
Yeah, right?

32:55.260 --> 32:56.360
No, no, you still are like--

32:56.360 --> 32:59.070
Raven, to be honest,
at first I was like,

32:59.070 --> 32:59.880
I don't get this girl.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.350
Is she putting it on?

33:01.350 --> 33:03.630
Because your
personality is so big.

33:03.630 --> 33:04.940
Yeah, but no, I--

33:04.940 --> 33:06.800
it's because, like I
tell people, because

33:06.800 --> 33:08.420
of what I've gone
through, I literally

33:08.420 --> 33:09.800
have a second chance of life.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.780
I don't go through
life existing,

33:11.780 --> 33:13.770
I go through life living
the hell out of it.

33:13.770 --> 33:16.730
I have a disease
called gastroparesis.

33:16.730 --> 33:19.130
Basically, my
stomach is paralyzed.

33:19.130 --> 33:24.100
It does not digest food at all
so I have a stomach pacemaker.

33:24.100 --> 33:27.860
This is Thor, he
allows me to eat food.

33:27.860 --> 33:29.570
There is no cure, unfortunately.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.400
But without it, I
wouldn't be here.

33:31.400 --> 33:35.120
I call my pacemaker
like my second heart.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.720
I used to hate my
scars but they're mine,

33:37.720 --> 33:39.300
you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

33:39.300 --> 33:40.180
They're my story.

33:40.180 --> 33:41.540
They're your story, yes.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.390
I've had like eight
stomach surgeries.

33:43.390 --> 33:44.090
Wow.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.860
I was in the hospital
for six months.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.050
You know, I would stare
at my hospital room

33:48.050 --> 33:49.370
thinking this was
going to be it.

33:49.370 --> 33:50.930
But that's why I'm
so happy because I'm

33:50.930 --> 33:52.310
just happy to be alive.

33:52.310 --> 33:54.890
I'm happy to be here and
experience this because I'm

33:54.890 --> 33:56.300
on my third pacemaker.

33:56.300 --> 34:00.570
There's 15 settings, I'm
on number nine, you know?

34:00.570 --> 34:04.190
So I know when I get to 15,
that's kind of like, it.

34:04.190 --> 34:05.270
That's it.

34:05.270 --> 34:06.170
There is no option.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.400
There is no cure.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.260
You're a strong girl.

34:09.260 --> 34:10.140
God bless you.

34:10.140 --> 34:11.640
Oh, you're going to
make me cry, thank you.

34:11.640 --> 34:12.560
No, but for real.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.800
You have a great spirit
so don't ever change that.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.470
I mean, I have two
hearts, what do you expect?

34:17.470 --> 34:18.170
Yeah.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.400
Hey.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.850
Hi.

34:32.850 --> 34:33.600
Hi.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.930
How are you?

34:34.930 --> 34:38.070
Hey guys, Christmas is back.

34:38.070 --> 34:39.530
Man, I was hoping
for a blue cast.

34:39.530 --> 34:41.680
Oh, they're going
to do a new one.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.560
I've returned from surgery
and now I have to get

34:43.560 --> 34:45.320
my head back in the game.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.730
You know you wouldn't want
to come back into a house

34:47.730 --> 34:49.920
that you are locked up with
people that are trying to get

34:49.920 --> 34:51.700
rid of you left and right.

34:51.700 --> 34:53.810
So I actually had
10 broken bones.

34:53.810 --> 34:54.690
Oh my God.

34:54.690 --> 34:55.540
Oh my God.

34:55.540 --> 34:58.050
Four dislocated
and then he had

34:58.050 --> 35:00.180
to reconstruct the ligament.

35:00.180 --> 35:03.480
He said that it looked like
a bomb went off on my foot.

35:03.480 --> 35:09.090
And one of the bones was
so that they actually

35:09.090 --> 35:10.930
had to do a donor bone.

35:10.930 --> 35:13.020
What the?

35:13.020 --> 35:15.360
You have somebody
else's foot in your foot?

35:15.360 --> 35:18.410
I have somebody
else's bone in my bones.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.630
I mean, I about can't
hardly hold my tears back

35:20.630 --> 35:24.380
because you can see the
devastation in her face

35:24.380 --> 35:27.050
and I just feel
sick to my stomach.

35:27.050 --> 35:28.430
It's just devastating.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.560
That hurts me.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.030
I'm sorry.

35:32.030 --> 35:33.300
What's long term?

35:33.300 --> 35:36.680
It'll be a minimum of
six weeks in a cast post-op

35:36.680 --> 35:39.370
and possibly an additional
three to four weeks,

35:39.370 --> 35:40.820
depending on how fast I heal.

35:40.820 --> 35:42.940
And you'll get
full mobility back?

35:42.940 --> 35:44.660
- No.

36:11.770 --> 36:12.760
I'm sorry.

36:12.760 --> 36:16.250
It's It's OK.

36:16.250 --> 36:22.670
So it'll take about
a year to recover

36:22.670 --> 36:27.290
and then, like I-- he said
that arthritis will set in

36:27.290 --> 36:30.160
within one to five
years and then

36:30.160 --> 36:33.590
I'll have to have another
surgery to fuse everything

36:33.590 --> 36:35.240
in order to fix the arthritis.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.650
I maybe had aspirations
to go and compete again

36:49.650 --> 36:52.250
and this definitely
takes it off the table.

36:52.250 --> 36:56.510
And so I'm not sure what my
capability will be after this

36:56.510 --> 36:58.190
but that just means
that I have to focus

36:58.190 --> 37:00.050
my attention somewhere else.

37:00.050 --> 37:04.880
But it is what it is and I have
to be able to accept the gifts

37:04.880 --> 37:09.790
as they come, even if they
are in banged up packages.

37:09.790 --> 37:12.500
Please guys, don't
feel sorry for me

37:12.500 --> 37:17.010
just help me out
occasionally and let's

37:17.010 --> 37:20.000
rock these competitions.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.970
Robo girls.

37:20.970 --> 37:21.900
Yeah.

37:21.900 --> 37:22.600
OK?

37:22.600 --> 37:23.530
Yeah.

37:28.630 --> 37:30.970
I don't know what the
full extent of the deal was

37:30.970 --> 37:34.180
or whatever you're
thinking and that's

37:34.180 --> 37:35.690
why I came to talk
to you because I

37:35.690 --> 37:36.690
really like you and Jason.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.130
After my last
exchange with Alex,

37:42.130 --> 37:44.180
I'm a little worried and very
confused about what she's going

37:44.180 --> 37:46.780
to do with nominations so I
want to clear the air with her

37:46.780 --> 37:48.340
and make sure she's not
thinking about putting

37:48.340 --> 37:49.310
me up on the block this week.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.670
If you keep me
safe, you and Jay--

37:58.670 --> 38:01.460
because I know how close you
and Jason are so the least I

38:01.460 --> 38:05.690
can do is keep the

38:05.690 --> 38:07.100
I spoke with
Paul and he thinks

38:07.100 --> 38:08.660
that Dominique is
a bigger target

38:08.660 --> 38:10.070
and we should go after
her at this point.

38:10.070 --> 38:12.430
But I also don't know how
I really feel about Mark.

38:12.430 --> 38:14.930
Eventually I need to get
rid of the show-mances

38:14.930 --> 38:16.490
in order to take
control of the house.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.170
VOICEOVER: It's time
for America's vote.

38:28.170 --> 38:31.140
You can vote to tempt
the guest of your choice

38:31.140 --> 38:34.440
inside the den of temptation.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.510
Each temptation offers
an advantage that

38:36.510 --> 38:38.160
could help them in the game.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.890
But remember, it also
comes with a consequence

38:40.890 --> 38:43.860
that will affect one or
more of their housemates.

38:43.860 --> 38:48.460
The third temptation
is the halting hex.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.630
Who do you want to receive
this week's temptation?

38:51.630 --> 38:57.300
Go to cbs.com/bbvote for all
the details and to vote now.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.520
Remember, a house
guest can only be

38:59.520 --> 39:01.830
tempted inside the
den of temptation

39:01.830 --> 39:04.710
once so choose wisely.

39:04.710 --> 39:07.470
For free online voting
go to cbs.com/bbvote.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.150

Votes will be accepted
until July 19, 2017

39:11.430 --> 39:12.700
at 8:59 AM Pacific time.

39:20.710 --> 39:22.310
You know when I walked
by the  just

39:22.310 --> 39:23.820
told me he liked me
last night but you

39:23.820 --> 39:24.800
never know what that means.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.030
I need to talk to you.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.180
OK.

39:27.180 --> 39:28.550
Can I have 10
minutes with Dominique?

39:28.550 --> 39:30.340
Can you guys come right back up?

39:30.340 --> 39:33.830
Before nominations, I want
to talk to Alex to make sure

39:33.830 --> 39:35.420
that I am not on her radar.

39:35.420 --> 39:37.290
So I'm going to
be honest with you,

39:37.290 --> 39:41.050
I've been sensing
something is not right.

39:41.050 --> 39:42.480
So I just figured I'd
come and talk to you.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.280
If you have any
concerns, you can

39:43.280 --> 39:44.450
ask me any questions you want.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.610
It definitely-- no, I
can't say who the nominations

39:46.610 --> 39:50.410
are but I can guarantee you that
we should be solid for sure.

39:50.410 --> 39:51.930
OK, got it.
Got it.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.320
But I'm going to
be honest with you,

39:55.320 --> 39:57.810
I've been sensing
some fishy stuff

39:57.810 --> 40:02.170
as it relates to attempting
to get me out or Mark out.

40:02.170 --> 40:05.760
Do you know anybody
who is doing this?

40:05.760 --> 40:09.160
There are some
people or a person

40:09.160 --> 40:11.200
that is somewhat
insecure as it relates

40:11.200 --> 40:14.980
to me and another
person's friendship.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.490
Even though she's
not mentioning names,

40:16.490 --> 40:20.320
it's very obvious that
she's trying to name Elena.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.820
I'm being very
transparent with you.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.800
I knew it was coming
and just based on some

40:23.800 --> 40:25.900
of the things that were being
said, some of the things

40:25.900 --> 40:27.720
that were-- some of the
conversations that were had,

40:27.720 --> 40:29.830
I figured something was fishy.

40:29.830 --> 40:32.440
You go with what your
gut, the Holy Spirit

40:32.440 --> 40:33.690
is leading you to do.

40:33.690 --> 40:36.520
But I'm telling you,
face-to-face, you

40:36.520 --> 40:39.520
have a level head, you'll
be able to figure out

40:39.520 --> 40:40.250
the disconnects.

40:40.250 --> 40:41.170
OK.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.780
That's actually some good
information, thank you.

40:43.780 --> 40:45.610
So I was already sketched
out about Dominique,

40:45.610 --> 40:47.370
but now she's throwing
people from her own side

40:47.370 --> 40:48.270
of the house under the bus?

40:48.270 --> 40:50.950
That's super not cool
and a red flag for me.

40:50.950 --> 40:51.810
OK, cool, thank you.

40:51.810 --> 40:52.510
You're welcome.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.970
This is a nomination ceremony.

41:21.970 --> 41:24.950
It is my responsibility
as the head of household

41:24.950 --> 41:28.930
to nominate two house
guests for eviction.

41:28.930 --> 41:32.480
In my nomination block are
the keys of the house guests

41:32.480 --> 41:35.930
I have nominated for eviction.

41:35.930 --> 41:38.630
I will turn two keys to
lock in my nominations

41:38.630 --> 41:40.910
and their faces will
appear on the memory wall.

41:40.910 --> 41:42.700
The first house guest
I have nominated is.

41:52.690 --> 41:54.730
The next guest that
I've nominated is.

42:10.180 --> 42:12.580
I have nominated you
Jessica and Dominique

42:12.580 --> 42:13.870
for two different reasons.

42:13.870 --> 42:18.960
Jessica, I'm sorry, but we just
haven't made a real connection.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.060
Dominique, after
our one-on-one you

42:21.060 --> 42:23.430
gave me a couple of things when
we were talking that set up

42:23.430 --> 42:26.010
some red flags and I wanted
to make it very clear

42:26.010 --> 42:29.610
that I did not like
some of those things.

42:29.610 --> 42:31.800
This nomination
ceremony is adjourned.

42:36.670 --> 42:38.840
Alex puts me on the
block and I don't believe

42:38.840 --> 42:39.980
that she was working alone.

42:39.980 --> 42:42.410
I feel betrayed, I
feel lied to and I'm

42:42.410 --> 42:45.050
going to do whatever I got to
do to make sure that I secure

42:45.050 --> 42:46.280
my position in this house.

42:46.280 --> 42:49.870
Veto competition, what is up?

42:49.870 --> 42:51.670
I'm not surprised
that I'm on the block.

42:51.670 --> 42:54.400
I know that they've been gunning
to get me out of the house.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.720
I was prepared for
this so now I just

42:56.720 --> 43:01.690
got to win that power of veto
and keep myself safe this week.

43:01.690 --> 43:04.070
I do feel like Alex
broke the deal we made.

43:04.070 --> 43:06.340
However, admittedly, I am
pretty happy that Mark's

43:06.340 --> 43:07.690
not on the block.

43:07.690 --> 43:10.120
That's not guaranteed
safety for the week,

43:10.120 --> 43:12.400
but I feel really good
about us both being here

43:12.400 --> 43:15.440
at the end of live eviction.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.620
Now that Paul and I are
working secretly together,

43:17.620 --> 43:19.110
nobody's going to
see this coming.

43:19.110 --> 43:20.380
We're going to flip
the house and make

43:20.380 --> 43:23.050
sure everyone goes home but us.

43:23.050 --> 43:24.370
Mission accomplished.

43:24.370 --> 43:28.000
Now that the plan is in motion,
Dominique is on the block,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.520
I get to watch people start
to blow up their own game.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.260
Hopefully, I've
planted enough seeds

43:32.260 --> 43:34.530
so that no is going after
the vet in the house

43:34.530 --> 43:37.250
but they can start
going after each other.

43:37.250 --> 43:39.830
ANNOUNCER: Who will win
the power of veto and will

43:39.830 --> 43:41.920
it be used to save
either Dominique

43:41.920 --> 43:44.080
or Jessica from eviction?

43:44.080 --> 43:48.860
Find out Wednesday eight,
seven central on "Big Brother."
