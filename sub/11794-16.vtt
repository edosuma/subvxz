01:19.379 --> 01:21.414
 This week is the city
 cheerleading finals,

01:21.448 --> 01:23.983
 and once again Bayside
 and Valley are the favorites.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.519
But the real competition is
the prank war

01:26.553 --> 01:27.921
   between the two schools.

01:27.954 --> 01:31.825
 I intend to go down in history
 as Prankster Prince.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.394
   Okay, guys,
   what'd you come up with?

01:34.427 --> 01:39.566
  Okay,
  let's put snapping turtles
  in Valley's swimming pool.

01:39.599 --> 01:44.938
 Bad idea. Last time we did
 that their swim team
 set a world record.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.907
  Let's flush
  all their toilets at once.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.311
  Let's flush the water
  out of your brain.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.515
   Look guys, we can't
   let Valley strike first.

01:55.548 --> 01:56.750
Come on, think.

02:00.854 --> 02:04.290
   Uh-oh. Too late.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.459
You guys,
what happened?

02:06.493 --> 02:08.928
 We were at
 miniature golf practice
 when a couple of Valley guys

02:08.961 --> 02:12.699
  jumped out from behind
  the windmill and rolled us.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.402
 They can't do that
 to our nerds!

02:16.636 --> 02:19.205
  We gotta move, Zack.
  They got us first.

02:19.239 --> 02:22.709
   Okay, they got us first,
   but we'll get them best!

02:22.742 --> 02:25.211
  - Because we're tough, right?
  - Both: Right!

02:25.245 --> 02:27.213
Yikes!

02:29.716 --> 02:32.986
   - Max, please cut us loose.
   - It's only tissue paper.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.455
But they used two-ply.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.591
   All right,
   I'll use my pocket knife.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.660
 Whoa!

02:42.429 --> 02:44.531
 Thanks, Max.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.736
What are you guys
worried about?

02:49.769 --> 02:51.604
 You've won the last
 three years in a row.

02:51.638 --> 02:55.308
 You could beat Valley with
 your pom-poms tied
 behind your backs.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.977
   Not if we don't
   find a cheerleader
   to replace Nancy Zeiler.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.279
   What's wrong with Nancy?

02:59.312 --> 03:01.281
 She came down
 with the chickenpox.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.684
  Boy, talk about
  your lack of school spirit.

03:04.718 --> 03:08.655
   Hey,
   Jessie, why don't you do it?
   You know the cheers.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.357
- Me?
- Yeah.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.791
A cheerleader?

03:11.825 --> 03:14.527
  I'm class president,
  not some silly schoolgirl.

03:14.561 --> 03:17.330
 - Ooh.
 - "Silly schoolgirl"?

03:17.364 --> 03:20.600
   Oh please,
   somebody sound
   the snoot alarm.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.536
  I didn't mean silly in a bad
  way. There are
  different kinds of silly.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.939
 There's good silly,
 and bad silly and silly silly.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.541
And what I really meant
to say was...

03:28.575 --> 03:31.511
   shut up, Jessie.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.480
 Jessie, we just want to win.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.615
   There are lots of girls
   better at this than I am.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.384
I'll help you find one.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.686
 Okay. We'll hold emergency
 tryouts after school.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.421
   Well,
   that solves your problem.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.289
   We still have to come up
   with a big prank

03:43.323 --> 03:44.758
   to get even with Valley.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.332
  Now more than ever.

03:52.365 --> 03:57.904
Wow, the nerds stole
one of Valley's tires.

03:57.937 --> 04:01.508
 Okay, Rhonda, you're next.
 Start with our
 basic Bayside cheer.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.776
   Okay, here goes.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.544
  "Gimme a B.
  Gimme an A.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.347
  "Gimme a...

04:07.380 --> 04:08.682
gimme a hint."

04:08.715 --> 04:11.951
  - "Y."
  - Because I can't remember.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.887
  Thank you, Rhonda.
  We'll let you know.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.822
 Come on, gimme another chance,
 I'm better with
 the fight cheer.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.358
  Fight, fight cheer.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.728
- All right.
- We'll do it together.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.300
 - Ready?
 - All: Okay!

04:27.334 --> 04:30.570
 "Bayside, Bayside,
 fight, fight, fight!"

04:31.671 --> 04:33.673
 Very moving, Rhonda.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.375
   We'll let you know, okay?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.713
  Come on, Jessie.
  We really need you.

04:39.746 --> 04:43.483
 Yeah, we've seen 28 girls,
 and we still
 haven't found anyone.

04:43.516 --> 04:46.920
   Come on.
   Betty-Sue Breckenridge
   was not that bad.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.757
 - She's
 the school crossing guard.
 - She's 60 years old.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.595
 She sure did
 nail that cartwheel.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.896
Jessie, please?

04:56.930 --> 05:00.533
   Okay, I'm in.
   "Rah, rah, rah."

05:00.567 --> 05:02.569
 - Zack: All right, guys.
 - Slater: All right.

05:02.602 --> 05:03.636
 - Yeah.
 - All right.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.739
   Well, ladies, we did it.

05:05.772 --> 05:09.576
   That's right. You're looking
   at the prank
   champions of the world.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.444
What are you guys
so cocky about?

05:11.478 --> 05:14.347
Prank one: we put superglue
on Valley's track.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.951
 That's right,
 the 100-yard dash
 has been going on for hours.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.422
Prank two: we pumped helium
in the music room.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.625
  Now their Glee Club
  sounds like The Chipmunks.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.628
   Fellas...

05:31.664 --> 05:33.900
   ( high voices )
  <i>* Oh, when the saints</i>

05:33.933 --> 05:35.702
<i>* Go marching in</i>

05:35.735 --> 05:38.204
<i>* Oh, when the saints</i>
<i>go marching in</i>

05:38.238 --> 05:39.773
  <i>* Marching in</i>

05:41.708 --> 05:43.710
   That's nothing
   compared to the biggie...

05:43.743 --> 05:45.712
   Slater, if you please...
   here we go.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.414
   Take it.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.851
 Ta-da.
 We took their school banner.

05:51.885 --> 05:55.789
 That's stealing!
 Okay, we borrowed it.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.824
 It's the same thing, Zack.
 I'm sorry,

05:57.857 --> 06:00.026
   l just do not approve
   of that kind of behavior.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.028
   Well, then send me
   to my room, Mama!

06:02.028 --> 06:04.164
 Yeah!

06:07.033 --> 06:09.903
Come on, guys, let's do it.
We did it, yeah!

06:09.936 --> 06:12.939
   We're walking, we're bad.

06:17.410 --> 06:20.880
  - I don't believe it.
  - Who could have done this?

06:22.749 --> 06:24.751
  Hey, it wasn't me.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.321
It was Valley.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.358
I knew that.
I did, I did, I did...

06:32.392 --> 06:33.593
   Oh great.

06:33.626 --> 06:36.930
 Don't tell me it's
 the prank war again.

06:36.963 --> 06:41.568
Okay, Mr.
Belding, we won't. "Happy
Birthday" from Valley.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.971
Every year it's
the same thing.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.841
  All right boys,
  how did it start this time?

06:47.874 --> 06:50.877
 They tushie-tissued our nerds.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.913
   I am not putting up
   with this nonsense again.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.782
   In the morning,
   I'm going over to Valley

06:55.815 --> 06:57.617
  and I'm gonna
  talk with their principal.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.919
  Come on, sir.
  Let's beat them
  at their own game.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.455
No, it's time we put
an end to this.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.858
 Principal Stingwell and I
 go back a long time.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.460
 He and I will work this out.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.329
  Until then,

07:09.362 --> 07:12.298
no more pranks.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.702
  Maybe Mr. Belding's right.

07:15.735 --> 07:18.805
   Yeah. You know,
   maybe we've gone too far.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.874
 Yeah.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.246
   <i>( alarm blares )</i>

07:30.850 --> 07:33.186
   <i>( alarm blares )</i>

07:37.223 --> 07:39.559
 You boys are
 a disgrace to Valley.

07:39.592 --> 07:43.329
  Pranking is a...
  a fine art.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.866
 What you did at Bayside...
 strictly amateur.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.202
  We're sorry, Mr. Stingwell.

07:49.235 --> 07:53.273
 Well, don't feel bad.
 I have a book
 that might help you.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.208
Here, read up.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.679
   ( laughing hysterically )

08:04.217 --> 08:07.887
  Now that's a prank!

08:07.921 --> 08:09.923
Boy, I slay me!

08:11.858 --> 08:14.427
 Now go back to class.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.898
 Rich.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.900
   Hi, Elliot. Still using
   the ol' book trick, huh?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.769
 Works every time, pal.
 How ya doing?

08:22.802 --> 08:24.804
  - Huh-uh.
  - Oh, okay.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.875
 I should have known.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.845
Come on in, sit right here.
Sit right here.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.482
  I think I'll sit over here.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.284
<i>( horn honks )</i>

08:40.720 --> 08:43.957
My, my, Richard.
Noisy panties.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.763
 What are you wearing,
 "Toot of the Looms?"

08:54.968 --> 08:58.238
Aren't you ever
gonna grow up, Stinky?

08:58.271 --> 09:01.675
  Some things never change.
  What can I do for you, pal?

09:01.708 --> 09:04.844
  I think that it's time we put
  an end to this prank war.

09:05.845 --> 09:09.416
 I...
 I... I can't believe my ears.

09:09.449 --> 09:12.285
 Is this the same
 "Mad Dog" Belding
 who only 20 years ago

09:12.318 --> 09:15.689
 put jumping
 beans in the chili?
 You started it, pal.

09:15.722 --> 09:19.459
  I didn't start it.
  You started it
  when you planted poison ivy

09:19.492 --> 09:20.527
on our football field.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.529
That was kind of rash.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.700
 Look, this has gone too far.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.335
 I don't care who started it,

09:28.368 --> 09:31.404
let's just put an end to it
right now.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.873
 You... you really mean it,
 don't you?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.276
I'm afraid so, Stinky.

09:36.309 --> 09:40.246
 Well, I guess
 the Bayside/Valley prank war

09:40.280 --> 09:41.481
 had to end sometime.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.316
   We'll all be better off.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.218
 I guess you're right.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.530
  It was fun while
  it lasted though,
  wasn't it, Stinky?

09:57.564 --> 10:00.066
   You bet, Mad Dog.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.268
See ya.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.147
  So how do we look?

10:14.180 --> 10:16.549
 Like Rambo and Dumbo.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.753
   What's with the outfits?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.756
We're about to make
our assault on Valley.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.158
   What are you going to do?

10:25.191 --> 10:28.995
 We don't know yet. We spent
 all our time getting dressed.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.032
   Hey, where's Screech?
   He was supposed
   to meet us here.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.100
  ( grunts )

10:36.936 --> 10:38.672
 Who are you?

10:38.705 --> 10:41.708
Teenage Mutant
Ninja Screech.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.580
 Hold brick, Lisa-san.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.049
 Why?

10:49.082 --> 10:51.718
  So cannot slap me.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.221
  Old ninja diversion tactic.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.223
 Aaah!

10:58.324 --> 11:00.927
 Lisa revenge tactic.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.063
This whole prank war
is ridiculous.

11:03.063 --> 11:06.066
  Zack, let me give her
  ninja death pinch.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.970
 Screech, Screech.
 Save it for Valley, come on.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.605
 - Heel, Screech.
 - It's okay.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.974
  I wish we knew what cheer
  Valley was doing.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.912
Hey yeah, then we'd know
what we're up against.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.481
   Oh Screechie-san.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.717
  Yes, flower petal?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.752
If you're going
over to Valley,

11:25.785 --> 11:27.620
 maybe you could spy
 on the cheerleading practice.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.556
   Yeah, see if they
   have a new cheer.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.191
   We could do that.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.160
  I don't believe you guys.
  Why would we stoop so low?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.562
To win.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.231
   - Take notes.
   - Excuse me, Sly.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.633
  We have to go to practice.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.741
 Kelly: <i>Jessie, this is</i>
<i>your weirdest idea yet.</i>

11:53.113 --> 11:56.116
  Whoever heard of ankle-length
  cheerleading skirts?

11:58.018 --> 12:00.520
My grandmother.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.622
Give them a chance.
They're very ladylike.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.924
  But how is this
  gonna help us win?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.527
   The judges won't be
   distracted by our bodies,

12:07.560 --> 12:09.562
 they'll be listening
 to our words.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.766
  Jessie, our words are
  "Beat,
  ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-beat."

12:12.799 --> 12:16.503
  I've taken care of that too.
  Now listen to this... ahem.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.773
 "We are the ladies of Bayside,
 the best school around.

12:19.806 --> 12:23.143
  "Winning's not important,
  'cause our minds are sound.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.212
"Rah."

12:26.246 --> 12:31.184
 We couldn't win if we did
 this cheer in our underwear.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.853
  I have another one.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.556
Hey, wait a minute.
This isn't bad.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.159
  Let me see.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.961
This is good, Jessie.
But isn't it dangerous?

12:41.995 --> 12:44.197
 Only for the mascot.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.867
   - But Screech is the mascot.
   - I love it.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.173
 Hey, guys.
 How's practice going?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.174
Great.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.643
 Did you find anything out
 at Valley last night?

12:56.676 --> 12:58.645
  Well, their cheer
  looks pretty good.

12:58.678 --> 13:02.515
But I wouldn't worry,
we stole their spirit.

13:02.549 --> 13:06.953
  - What do you mean?
  - Look what I got.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.955
 Valley's mascot?
 That's great!

13:09.055 --> 13:11.858
 No, that's dognapping.
 It's a crime!

13:11.891 --> 13:15.595
What are they gonna do,
throw us in the pound?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.698
   Come on guys, we're gonna
   return him right after
   the competition.

13:18.732 --> 13:21.101
  That's right.
  And now comes
  the real zinger...

13:21.134 --> 13:24.504
 we send them
 a picture of their
 mascot with our cheerleaders.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.873
 All right now, ladies,
 everybody in
 front of the banners.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.142
Lisa, stand next to me.

13:29.175 --> 13:32.579
   Sorry, all members
   of the animal
   kingdom up front.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.082
   Okay, here we go. Ready?

13:37.283 --> 13:40.120
  Hey, guys. What's going on?

13:40.153 --> 13:43.523
We're practicing our
"Merry-Go-Round" cheer.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.191
 That's great.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.694
  Hey, Mr.
  Belding, glad you made it
  before we took our picture.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.696
Picture? What picture?

13:49.729 --> 13:52.599
   A picture to show
   that our school's
   behind our cheerleaders.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.001
  That is a fine idea, boys.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.871
  Sir, why don't you
  get in the picture?

13:57.904 --> 14:00.040
   It'll give it more zing.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.575
 All right, Zack.
 Where should I stand?

14:02.609 --> 14:07.047
  The biggest,
  most muscular guys
  usually stand in the back.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.616
   That's where they always
   put us hunks.

14:12.485 --> 14:16.189
 Okay now, everybody
 on the count of three,
 say "Zing."

14:16.222 --> 14:19.526
   One, two, three.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.729
 Zing!

14:22.762 --> 14:25.665
  They've got our mascot hidden
  somewhere here at Bayside.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.835
   Let's search every inch
   of this school
   till we find him.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.839
 Hey, dudes. Wait until you see
 our new cheer tonight.

14:32.872 --> 14:37.077
  We're gonna blow Valley away.
  What are you talking about?

14:37.077 --> 14:40.146
  I'm the star
  of Bayside's secret cheer.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.483
  - Did you hear that, Dan?
  - Sure did, Stan.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.086
   Yep, without me,
   we don't stand a chance.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.089
 - Interesting, Stan.
 - Very, Dan.

14:49.122 --> 14:53.193
   Yep, everybody in a Bayside
   jacket ought to be proud.

14:58.832 --> 15:02.635
   All right!
   You guys stole
   Valley t-shirts.

15:02.669 --> 15:07.574
   No, we stole
   Bayside jackets.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.643
   Hold it. That would mean
   you're from...

15:11.845 --> 15:12.946
Valley!

15:13.046 --> 15:15.548
  Both: Right, dude!

15:24.090 --> 15:25.425
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.793
  Hi.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.161
   I got a question.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.463
  Exactly how necessary
  is Screech

15:30.497 --> 15:32.766
 to winning
 the cheerleading competition?

15:32.799 --> 15:36.536
   He's the foundation on which
   our whole cheer is based.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.905
   Well, you're gonna be
   one brick short.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.075
   Valley took him.
   He's been Screech-napped!

15:42.075 --> 15:44.411
 This is terrible.
 Poor Screech.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.480
 Poor Screech? Poor us!
 We're doomed.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.850
 Don't sweat it.
 They'll be begging
 us to take him back by lunch.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.920
  - You think so?
  - Did you ever see him eat?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.322
  I don't believe it. Don't you
  guys care about Screech?

15:56.356 --> 15:59.492
 If we don't get him back,
 Valley will win the prank war.

16:01.027 --> 16:04.497
  And now,
  the presentation of medals

16:04.531 --> 16:08.034
for the Prankster
of the Century.

16:08.034 --> 16:12.806
   Gold and silver medals,
   the Clegg cousins,
   from Valley High.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.417
And now coming in dead last
for the worst
prank of the year...

16:25.819 --> 16:27.187
   what was your name, son?

16:27.220 --> 16:30.323
  - Zack Morris.
  - Jack Norris from Bayside.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.861
  You're a good sport, Jack.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.864
  Here is your
  consolation prize.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.210
   I'm just kidding.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.312
  Here is your medal.

17:00.387 --> 17:04.023
   Here, let me
   help you clean this off.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.166
 We've got to get Screech back.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.202
  All you care about
  is your prank war.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.338
 What about
 our cheerleading competition?

17:18.371 --> 17:21.307
  She's right. You've got
  to tell Belding the truth.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.044
The truth? Wow!

17:24.077 --> 17:27.480
What a concept!

17:27.513 --> 17:31.251
   I thought that we agreed
   to put an end to
   this prank war.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.355
   We did, sir. We're sorry.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.091
   Mr.
   Belding, you have to help us
   get Screech back.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.326
All right,
I'll get Screech back.

17:40.360 --> 17:45.065
Zack, you and Slater get
their dog while I call
Principal Stingwell.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.968
   I hate to admit it, Mad Dog,
   but you're right.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.870
  Things have
  gotten out of hand.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.141
We'll have our
kids exchange mascots
before the competition.

17:55.175 --> 17:58.812
You've got my
word on it, Richard.
Okay, goodbye.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.351
   Okay, guys.
   Take the tiger
   back to Bayside.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.153
 I've gotta go.
 It's my anniversary.

18:07.187 --> 18:10.190
I'm gonna buy my wife
some exploding flowers.

18:13.927 --> 18:18.198
   You heard what he said.
   Take me back to Bayside.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.835
 He just said
 take the tiger back.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.239
  ( crying )

18:29.075 --> 18:31.511
Where are they?
The competition
starts in five minutes.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.747
   We can't do the cheer
   without Screech.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.150
  - Come on, Jessie, relax.
  - I am relaxed!

18:37.183 --> 18:39.419
  Here, chew on this.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.223
It kept the dog quiet.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.126
  Here comes Stan Clegg now.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.797
 Here, we gave it a flea bath.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.333
Screech, are you okay?

18:53.366 --> 18:55.769
 We don't have time for this.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.040
   Here's your dog.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.375
  All right,
  now get outta here, Clegg.

19:02.409 --> 19:06.079
Yeah, go walk your dog.
All right!

19:06.112 --> 19:08.081
 All right, Preppie.
 Let's go to the gym.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.350
 - I forgot about
 the tiger's tail.
 - Hurry up! Come on.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.253
- Guys!
- Hey, Screech.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.021
   Screech?!

19:15.021 --> 19:17.023
 What are you doing
 out of your tiger's costume?

19:17.023 --> 19:19.225
  I just escaped from Valley!

19:19.259 --> 19:21.227
  If you're not in
  the tiger's costume,
  then who...

19:21.261 --> 19:24.097
  Clegg's cousin, Dan.
  He's gonna ruin our cheer!

19:24.130 --> 19:25.899
Now that's it!

19:25.932 --> 19:28.401
   We're gonna sting Valley
   once and for all.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.904
  Screech, are you still
  in the Insect Club?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.872
  Yeah, I'm in charge
  of new membership.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.875
Good. Here's the plan.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.916
 Ready? Okay!

19:42.949 --> 19:45.852
 All: "So you think you're hot?
 So you think you're cool?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.822
  "It's time you learned
  that Valley rules!

19:48.855 --> 19:51.958
"We're the baddest, we're
the toughest,
we're the best around.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.494
 "The Bulldogs have arrived
 to knock you down.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.931
 "So you think you'll win,
 so you think you can't lose,

19:57.964 --> 20:00.834
  "we're gonna teach you
  that Valley rules!

20:00.867 --> 20:05.105
"Valley rules!
Vall-eey rules!

20:05.138 --> 20:07.173
  For sure!"

20:13.380 --> 20:16.216
  - Boy, they were really good.
  - Yeah, but we're better.

20:16.249 --> 20:19.119
  We're gonna knock them
  on their pom-poms.

20:19.152 --> 20:22.455
Screech, are you sure
you remember the cheer?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.792
Here you go, Zack.
They're our best ants.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.795
  - They're picnic tested.
  - Thanks, Screech.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.897
   All right. Now bug off
   before anybody sees you.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.899
 Come on, go!

20:32.932 --> 20:36.036
 Next on the floor...
 the cheerleaders from Bayside.

20:40.874 --> 20:43.977
   Hey, Screech, we forgot
   to put your tail back on.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.046
   Silly us.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.416
Now don't worry, Screech.
We're behind you 100%.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.184
   Oh, yeah.

20:52.919 --> 20:56.056
 Ready? And...
 "T-l-G-E-R-S,

20:56.089 --> 21:01.294
 - "T-l-G-E-R-S,
 T-l-G-E-R-S..."
 - "Bayside, Bayside."

21:01.327 --> 21:04.297
"We're the Bayside Tigers
and we're on the prowl.

21:04.330 --> 21:07.167
   "When we come to your school
   we will make you howl.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.804
  "Hear
  the Bayside Tigers growl!
  Ra-aah!

21:10.837 --> 21:13.306
"We're the Bayside Tigers
and we're gonna score.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.409
"Get as much as you can,
'cause we'll get more.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.179
 "Hear the Bayside Tigers roar!
 Ra-aah!"

21:19.212 --> 21:21.114
  Zack: Yeah!

21:25.352 --> 21:28.355
  "T-l-G-E-R-S, T-l-G-E-R-S,

21:28.388 --> 21:31.491
  "Bayside, Bayside,

21:31.524 --> 21:34.794
  "Bayside!"

21:43.503 --> 21:47.273
 And now for
 the judges' decision.

21:55.849 --> 21:57.417
  This year's winner

21:57.450 --> 22:00.286
of the coveted
Golden Megaphone is...

22:01.354 --> 22:03.790
  the Bayside Tigers!

22:07.894 --> 22:09.396
  Screech, you were terrific.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.898
   I can't believe I actually
   want to give you a kiss.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.334
 - Plant it here, babe.
 - ( screams )

22:14.367 --> 22:17.937
  Wait a second,
  Screech, if you're
  here, then who's in there?

22:19.172 --> 22:21.908
 That's Dan Clegg, from Valley.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.810
  He was gonna wreck
  our cheer.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.349
Sorry, Richard.
I'll take care if this.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.218
   Why I ought to...

22:34.821 --> 22:36.823
  Well, we won the prank war.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.525
   Valley may have struck
   the first blows,

22:38.558 --> 22:41.094
 but it looks like we
 got them in the end.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.162
   Here we go, guys.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.298
  One, two, three... Bayside!

22:50.570 --> 22:53.406
 <i>( instrumental music plays )</i>
