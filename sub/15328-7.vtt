00:02.460 --> 00:07.090
- Word of warning--
Dad's grumpy.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.341
My alarm didn't go off,

00:08.425 --> 00:10.260
the newspaper landed
in something,

00:10.343 --> 00:11.886
and I'm pretty sure

00:11.970 --> 00:15.807
my new cholesterol meds
are making me shorter.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.518
I just wanna have
a quiet breakfast.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.687

- [kicking drawer]

00:20.770 --> 00:22.355
- [pot slamming]

00:22.439 --> 00:24.357
- There you go--
nice and quiet.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.484
- James let loose
a water bug in the kitchen.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.237
- Yeah, after Steph
served it for breakfast.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.448
- I served steel-cut
organic oatmeal

00:31.531 --> 00:33.742
with brown sugar
and raisins.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.870
- The one with the legs
wasn't a raisin.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.956
- I'll go get the bug spray.
- No, no, no, no! No!

00:40.039 --> 00:41.291
We're trying to
keep it alive.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.251
- It came from Aaron's
bug collection.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.461
- Oh.
- [cell phone ringing]

00:44.544 --> 00:46.629
- I'll get the phone.
You get the bug.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.759
- Uh, hey. You know, Dad,
you are rockin' those pjs.

00:50.842 --> 00:55.221
You look comfortable,
yet sophisticated.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.473
- I told you--
you're not throwing

00:56.556 --> 00:58.975
a house party
here with Molly.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.643
- You guys wanna
have a party?

01:00.727 --> 01:04.563
That must be what my Molly
was talking about last night.

01:04.647 --> 01:08.067
It's so hard to read lips
through all those branches.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.780
- James, you can stalk
her till the cows come home.

01:11.863 --> 01:15.658
But you'd have a better chance
dating one of the cows.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.995
Dad, it's just gonna be a small
group of friends hanging out.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.164
- Yeah, high school parties
might start small,

01:21.247 --> 01:22.624
but then they fester.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.126
Soon it's a mob of kids,
a trashed house,

01:25.210 --> 01:27.253
and some guy driving
through your living room

01:27.337 --> 01:28.630
on a motorcycle.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.340
- Oh, Dad, the parties
when you were

01:30.423 --> 01:33.593
in high school
sound awesome!

01:33.676 --> 01:35.470
- They sounded so awesome,

01:35.553 --> 01:38.014
I almost felt bad about calling
the police on them.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.892
- [squeals]
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

01:40.975 --> 01:42.811
Ha! Ha! That was
"Good Morning, Philadelphia."

01:42.894 --> 01:44.771
They're doing a family week,

01:44.854 --> 01:46.815
so I sent in a video of
Aaron and me dancing

01:46.898 --> 01:48.900
and they want us to do
a routine on TV!

01:48.983 --> 01:50.443
- That's great.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.903
- We're pre-taping
Friday night.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.696
- Oh, that so cool, Steph.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.782
But could you do me a solid
and use your maiden name

01:55.865 --> 01:58.993
in case my friends watch?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.246
- The bug's on my leg!

02:04.207 --> 02:05.458
Ah. Oh, my bad.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.294
That was a raisin.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.630
- The bug's on the table!
- Oh, don't let it escape!

02:10.713 --> 02:13.341
- But don't hurt it!
Aaron loves his bugs.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.218
- What are we lookin' at?
- A water bug.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.263
- Oh.

03:08.771 --> 03:12.358
{\an8}My jazz hands won't close.

close them this weekend

03:14.277 --> 03:15.987
{\an8}after we've been on TV.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.822
{\an8}I've been telling everybody.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.074
{\an8}I even told that crazy lady who
hangs around the pharmacy.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.161
{\an8}And she told all
the people in her head.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.871
{\an8}- Hi, hi, hi!

03:24.954 --> 03:27.165
{\an8}- All right, good rehearsal.
Go get a popsicle.

03:27.248 --> 03:30.293
{\an8}Make it half a popsicle.
You're a dancer now.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.004
{\an8}You have to eat like one.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.632

on a gold chain--

03:35.715 --> 03:37.258
{\an8}give it to me.

{\an8}- When people come over,
they usually bring things.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.930
{\an8}- You borrowed that necklace
over a month ago.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.389
{\an8}- I gave it back.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.559
{\an8}- You have had
your eyes on my cameo

03:46.643 --> 03:48.686
{\an8}since you were a child.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.188
{\an8}Many a night I woke up

03:50.271 --> 03:56.152
{\an8}with your tiny little hands
clawing at my throat.

03:56.235 --> 04:00.615
{\an8}- Oh, were you
wearing a necklace?

04:00.698 --> 04:03.242
{\an8}- Come on, Dad,
buy me those sunglasses.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.745
- No. You've lost every
pair I've gotten you.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.038
- You've probably
lost a few patients,

04:07.121 --> 04:09.207
but you keep
gettin' new ones.

04:09.290 --> 04:14.170
- James, Dad is one of the top
cardiologists in Philadelphia,

04:14.253 --> 04:16.214
and too smart and
broad-shouldered

04:16.297 --> 04:18.423
for your transparent ploys.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.093
- Thank you, Gabby.
- Mm-hm.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.595
- But you're not having
a party in our house.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.514
- Oh, that was quick, buddy.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.890
Did you finish that
popsicle already?

04:25.974 --> 04:28.351
- I didn't have one.
I'm done with popsicles.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.019
- Since when?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.854
You live for popsicles.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.190
- I said I didn't
want one, Steph.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.276
Let it go.
- STEPHANIE: Uh...

04:37.360 --> 04:42.615
Did Aaron just snap at me?
About a popsicle?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.367
- Something's up with him.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.286
I mean, that bug
thing yesterday.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.787
That was really weird.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.163
- This morning he threw
a hissy fit

04:49.247 --> 04:51.249
just because I took his desk.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.667
- Why'd you take his desk?

04:52.750 --> 04:54.419
- Hello, you don't
make the payments,

04:54.502 --> 04:57.922
you don't keep
the furniture.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.842
- There's your answer.

05:00.925 --> 05:06.180
Aaron is upset because of
all of his scammin' and stealin'

05:06.264 --> 05:09.350
and no parents around
to teach them better.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.476
- Maybe Aaron is upset

05:10.560 --> 05:12.770
because somebody who
doesn't live here

05:12.854 --> 05:15.898
keeps barging in uninvited.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.400
- Oh, please.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.946
I am the only stable thing in
his topsy-turvy little life.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.450
- Stable?
You're annoying.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.785
And you're creating
confusion,

05:27.869 --> 05:30.955
and you're annoying.
- Charlie--

05:31.039 --> 05:33.875
- What's annoying is being
told "no" all the time, Dad.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.960
You've crushed Aaron's spirit.
- Oh. [laughs]

05:36.044 --> 05:37.879
- You're crushing
all our spirits

05:37.962 --> 05:39.672
in this prison
of negativity.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.800
- I am not negative.
That's dumb.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.304
- Guys, guys, can we please--
- Gabby's the problem.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.264
You're always asking
for stuff.

05:48.347 --> 05:49.682
Gimme. Gimme. Gimme.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.518
You are a terrible
example for Aaron.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.270
I am a good example.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.147
But I could be
an even better one

05:56.230 --> 06:00.026
in some fine
Italian sunglasses.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.821
- See? You can't stop
scammin' for one second.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.199
- I can stop
any time I want--

06:06.282 --> 06:08.326
for the right price.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.702
- Enough!

06:09.786 --> 06:11.662
All of this tension
and dysfunction

06:11.746 --> 06:13.706
is what messes Aaron up.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.166
- I blame Stephanie.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.292
- Yeah, you're the one

06:16.375 --> 06:18.127
who's pushin' him into
that dance thing.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.546
- You push everybody.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.633
- Charlie's right.
You come over here too much.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.177
- Ha! Ha! You heard her.
[laughs]

06:26.260 --> 06:27.387
- Give me a reason, Charlie.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.056
Give me a reason.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.017
- Everything we're doing--
this is the problem.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.811
You'd be screwed up, too,

06:34.894 --> 06:36.813
if you had to live
with all of us.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.023
James, you need to
stop scamming.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.359
Gabby, you need to
stop asking for stuff.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.237
Mom, you need to stop
coming over uninvited.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.696
I need to stop pushing,

06:45.780 --> 06:48.825
and, Charlie, you need
to stop saying "no."

06:48.908 --> 06:51.494
- No!

06:51.577 --> 06:53.746
- Don't care.
We're doing it.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.832
We're all gonna change
our behavior for a week

06:55.915 --> 06:57.792
to see if it helps Aaron.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.461
- Well, he's definitely
not himself.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.256
And I guess it can't hurt,
so, let's try it.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.216
- ALL: [groaning]
- Okay.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.343
- Good. Starting now--
I'll stop being pushy.

07:07.426 --> 07:11.264
Everybody, hands in.
- Still pushy.

07:11.347 --> 07:15.017
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Everybody, hands in--or else.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.354
That's not pushing,
that's threatening.

07:18.437 --> 07:20.606
- ALL: [sighing]

07:20.690 --> 07:22.650
- This ain't gonna work.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.072
Hi, hi, hi!

07:28.156 --> 07:29.657
- Maggie, you're not
supposed to be here

07:29.740 --> 07:31.117
without calling first.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.955
- I called James.
He said "Come over."

07:36.038 --> 07:37.874
- Sorry, helping
you pull a scam

07:37.957 --> 07:39.834
is also against the rules.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.546
And doin' it for one dollar
would just make me feel cheap.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.381
- [swats head]

07:45.464 --> 07:47.550
Your wife is hidin'
my necklace

07:47.633 --> 07:50.636
somewhere in this house
and I want it back.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.930
- You know the rules.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.807
This is for Aaron.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.394
Go on.

07:58.477 --> 08:01.564
- But if I don't get
my necklace back soon,

08:01.647 --> 08:04.150
these earrings
are comin' off.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.568
- There's no need
to get violent.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.696
- I'm not--they just
match the necklace.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.115
- Wow, Dad.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.910
It's cool how you're really
sticking to the new rules.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.662
- That's what we agreed to
and I'm a man of my word.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.498
- Oh, and since that word
can no longer be "no,"

08:19.582 --> 08:21.626
I'm gonna ask you again
if I can have a party.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.211
- I don't have to
say "no" because

08:23.294 --> 08:24.962
you're not allowed to ask.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.256
- Stephanie?
- Well, those are the rules.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.258
- Really, you're siding
with the man

08:29.342 --> 08:32.053
who just threw
your mama out?

08:32.135 --> 08:35.640
- I, however, am allowed
to ask for stuff.

08:35.722 --> 08:38.058
May I please have
those sunglasses?

08:38.142 --> 08:40.269
Remember--you can't
say "no."

08:40.352 --> 08:42.772
- Then let me say "yes"
to yesterday's "no."

08:42.855 --> 08:44.899
- That answer has a certain
"no-like" quality.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.567
- And yet it is a "yes."

08:46.651 --> 08:48.486
- Then let's go get
my sunglasses.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.613
- Sorry, "yes" means "no."
- But you can't say "no."

08:50.696 --> 08:52.490
- That's why I said "yes."

08:52.573 --> 08:54.951
- Charlie, no loopholes.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.453
James is not scamming,
he's asking,

08:57.536 --> 08:59.330
and surprisingly politely.

08:59.413 --> 09:03.167
I think we should reward that
by giving him the sunglasses.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.003
- But they're so expensive!
[stomping feet]

09:06.087 --> 09:07.672
Fine.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.841
When do you wanna
go and get them?

09:10.925 --> 09:12.718
James?
- Hang on, Dad.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.681
I can't hear you over
the choir in my head.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.724
- Hey, Aaron, there you are.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.685
Ready to rehearse
for our TV debut?

09:20.768 --> 09:23.437
- I changed my mind.
I'm not doing that anymore.

as an excuse to
complain about each other.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.097
- That's pretty messed up.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.141
- MAGGIE: Sure is.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.560
- All this conflict
in the home

19:46.643 --> 19:48.937
is probably why I felt
compelled to throw this party.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.858
You know? Acting out.
A cry for help.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.027
- If the kitchen looks anything
like this living room,

19:55.110 --> 19:57.988
you'll be crying
for more than help.

19:58.071 --> 20:02.117
Guys, the way we turned on each
other is a real problem.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.287
I think we need to have
a long, hard talk about it.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.707
- Or we keep being
who we are,

20:08.790 --> 20:11.209
and if any of us have
anger and resentment,

20:11.293 --> 20:13.754
we push it back
under the rug?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.172
- Push it back
under the rug?

20:15.255 --> 20:16.965
[laughs]

20:17.049 --> 20:19.426
Yeah, that works for me.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.637
- Speaking of rugs,

20:21.720 --> 20:27.309
I might have accidentally
given ours away.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.062
- MAGGIE: [laughing]

20:32.064 --> 20:47.955
- ♪
