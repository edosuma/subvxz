00:09.668 --> 00:11.101
but you can't force me to change.

00:11.737 --> 00:13.070
A princess.

00:14.573 --> 00:16.340
<i>That's the real me.</i>

00:16.408 --> 00:17.769
You want me to marry your daughter?

02:09.822 --> 02:11.488
Why have I been brought here?

02:13.092 --> 02:14.658
To stand trial.

02:15.728 --> 02:17.494
I have committed no crime.

02:17.563 --> 02:21.031
You practice magic, don't you?

02:21.100 --> 02:24.534
- I refuse to answer to you.
- I forgot.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.170
The Druids are above the rest of us.

02:27.177 --> 02:28.200
The Druids

02:28.207 --> 02:31.278
have faithfully served the Four
Lands for thousands of years.

02:33.912 --> 02:37.881
And yet hundreds of them were
slaughtered inside these very walls.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.485
Martyrs in their fight against
the forces of darkness.

02:41.553 --> 02:45.822
The Dagda Mor and the Warlock
Lord were both Druids.

02:45.891 --> 02:48.725
They started wars
that cost thousands of lives.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.794
They both abused the gift of magic.

02:50.863 --> 02:53.930
Empowering their souls to wreak
genocide throughout the Four Lands.

02:53.999 --> 02:57.567
And now you walk
the same path, General Riga.

02:57.636 --> 03:02.305
Only the warped mind of a Druid
could compare me to mass murderers.

03:02.374 --> 03:05.375
This fortress was the palace
of the Warlock Lord.

03:05.444 --> 03:07.177
And yet, here you sit upon his throne,

03:07.246 --> 03:10.313
lecturing me about the evils of magic

03:10.382 --> 03:14.785
while his dark stain looms
over the Four Lands once more.

03:14.853 --> 03:20.090
Who is going to defeat the Warlock
Lord if he awakens again?

03:26.932 --> 03:28.432

Where is the Codex of Paranor?

03:46.452 --> 03:47.484
(GROANS)

03:49.170 --> 03:52.905
That's where all of your magical
knowledge is kept, isn't it?

03:52.958 --> 03:54.991
You'll never possess the Codex.

03:56.995 --> 04:01.064
Because only the Druids can know
magic's secrets and wield its power?

04:01.133 --> 04:04.000
Magic is not a weapon,

04:04.069 --> 04:05.302
it is a gift.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.807
But it always comes with a price.

04:15.481 --> 04:18.882
You don't have to tell me
the price of magic.

04:18.951 --> 04:21.543
I witnessed my men being ripped apart

04:21.550 --> 04:24.215
by Demons outside the gates of Arborlon.

04:25.858 --> 04:29.292
And you dishonor your
fallen men with your actions.

04:30.929 --> 04:32.295
Let me go,

04:32.364 --> 04:34.698
so I can fight our true enemy.

04:43.942 --> 04:46.343
True enemy is magic.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.411
And once I've destroyed the Codex,

04:48.480 --> 04:51.448
it will be purged from
the Four Lands forever.

Amberle?

06:31.516 --> 06:33.316
That's impossible.

06:44.763 --> 06:46.162
Well, I'm supposed to be here.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.731
What are you doing here?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.866
WIL: What's going on?

06:49.935 --> 06:51.501
I saw him heading for the barn.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.570
- I thought he might try to kill you.
- Jax!

06:53.639 --> 06:54.738
Enough!

06:59.311 --> 07:00.944
It's your money.

07:02.147 --> 07:03.813

07:04.616 --> 07:07.417
Wil Ohmsford, meet Garet Jax.

07:07.486 --> 07:09.452
The Wil Ohmsford.

07:09.521 --> 07:11.688
The Crimson's most wanted.

07:11.757 --> 07:12.956
Haircut was a good call.

07:14.426 --> 07:17.527
She paid me a bag of diamonds
to help track you down.

07:17.596 --> 07:21.331
- You're a bounty hunter?
- I prefer "Weapons Master."

07:21.400 --> 07:23.400
Weapons Master?

07:23.468 --> 07:26.069
- Really?
- Really.

07:26.138 --> 07:27.170
Tell her.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.506
You saw what I did
back at the Rover camp.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.007
I took down eight men.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.175
Hardly broke a sweat.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.579
I'm Mareth, by the way,
thanks for the concern.

07:36.648 --> 07:39.516
Another pair of short tips...

07:40.419 --> 07:42.085
What are the odds?

07:42.154 --> 07:44.621
- I need to find Allanon.
- Since when?

07:44.690 --> 07:46.489
Since Bandon took my uncle.

07:46.558 --> 07:48.324
I have to find him and get to Paranor.

07:48.393 --> 07:50.593
Wait, the Crimson grabbed him in Leah.

07:50.662 --> 07:52.896
They're taking him
to a place called Graymark.

07:52.964 --> 07:55.298
- (WHISTLES)
- You've heard of it?

07:55.367 --> 07:57.667
It's an old gnome fortress
in the Ravenshorn.

07:57.736 --> 08:00.370
Magic users go in,
but they don't come out.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.639
I may have delivered them
a bounty or two.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.107
You work for the Crimson?

08:04.176 --> 08:05.775
Their money's as good as any.

08:05.844 --> 08:07.844
And before you go getting
all high and mighty,

08:07.913 --> 08:12.682
I don't do causes, ideology, politics,

08:12.751 --> 08:13.983
or guilt.

08:16.154 --> 08:18.088
- You're taking me to Graymark.
- Mmm.

08:18.156 --> 08:20.790
You can't just walk in there, the
Crimson are looking for you.

08:20.859 --> 08:22.592
I don't have a choice.

08:22.661 --> 08:24.461
My uncle's life depends on it.

08:24.529 --> 08:27.764
Well, I definitely
don't do lost causes either.

08:29.568 --> 08:32.034
I thought Garet Jax
didn't back down from a fight.

08:32.938 --> 08:34.971
You don't mess with The Crimson.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.674
So, the Weapons Master is
afraid of some stuck up Elves?

08:38.110 --> 08:39.542
Cute.

08:39.611 --> 08:41.044
But I'm not afraid of anything.

08:41.113 --> 08:43.446
That's a bold statement.

08:43.515 --> 08:46.916
Why don't you prove it
by getting me into Graymark?

09:05.670 --> 09:07.203
What did you say to Eretria?

have the room, please?

09:21.386 --> 09:22.752
Thank you.

09:24.956 --> 09:27.157
I told her the truth,

09:27.225 --> 09:28.658
that you've done this before

09:28.727 --> 09:30.760
and she was just the latest victim.

09:30.829 --> 09:34.297
Then I offered a bag
of diamonds for her troubles.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.566
You tried to pay her off?

09:36.635 --> 09:38.434
I didn't have to try that hard.

09:38.503 --> 09:39.836
She took it gladly.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.807
My dear,

09:43.875 --> 09:46.676
let me be crystal clear.

09:46.745 --> 09:48.478
You have one purpose right now

09:48.547 --> 09:50.180
and that's to marry King Ander.

09:54.319 --> 09:57.987
You have never shown
any love for the Elves.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.657
If I'm part of some bigger plan,

10:00.725 --> 10:02.158
I deserve to know.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.399
The Elves are on
the verge of a civil war.

10:09.467 --> 10:11.901
I doubt our aid
will prevent it at this point.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.236
As their queen,

10:13.305 --> 10:16.472
you'll convince your husband
to call on me for help.

10:16.541 --> 10:18.908
I, of course, will race to your aid.

10:18.977 --> 10:20.844
The army of Leah
will crush the uprising.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.303
And once we do,

10:22.310 --> 10:25.712
you will ask us to set up a garrison
in Arborlon to keep the peace.

10:26.017 --> 10:29.686
Allowing you to take over the
Westland without any resistance.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.289
I'm securing our future.

10:33.358 --> 10:36.693
My job is to protect my kingdom
by any means necessary.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.862
I expect your full cooperation.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.763
Actually, I demand it.

10:40.832 --> 10:43.032
And what if I don't?

10:43.101 --> 10:47.937
Then your rosy-lipped Rover friend
won't live to see another sunrise.

10:48.006 --> 10:51.207
And what makes you think you'd
even be able to find her again?

10:51.314 --> 10:55.082
And what makes you think I don't
have someone watching her already?

12:01.250 --> 12:03.751
has Mwellret blood
running through his veins?

12:03.819 --> 12:06.921
I wondered how you were
impervious to my magic.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.121
Amberle told you to find me.

15:31.427 --> 15:33.460
Did she say anything else?

15:35.531 --> 15:37.965
She said that darkness is coming...

15:39.668 --> 15:41.835
I'm sorry about Amberle.

15:41.904 --> 15:45.405
- Allanon told me the whole story.
- Did he?

15:45.474 --> 15:48.542
He knew what would happen to her
and he kept it from all of us.

15:48.611 --> 15:50.711
She made her choice, Wil.

take advantage of?

It's not a "party trick." It's magic.

You don't want to mess
with The Crimson.

makes them extremely dangerous.

about the minute we met.

18:34.603 --> 18:36.486

he agreed to bring us here

a few bucks on it.

to keep you out of this.

31:34.432 --> 31:41.304
But destiny is stronger
than the wishes of one man.

31:42.007 --> 31:43.606
Don't give me that crap.

31:45.710 --> 31:47.610
I'm here because you screwed up.

31:48.780 --> 31:50.246
(DOOR OPENS)

32:07.332 --> 32:08.832
Welcome, Wil.

32:08.900 --> 32:11.601
I've been waiting
a long time to meet you.

32:11.670 --> 32:14.537
Whatever you think
I can do for you, I can't.

32:14.606 --> 32:16.339
- Don't sell yourself short.
- Riga...

32:17.976 --> 32:19.442
(WIL SCREAMING)

33:10.161 --> 33:11.461
RIGA: With the valve wide open,

33:11.529 --> 33:14.264
I can drain all the blood
in his body within minutes.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.866
Tell me.

33:16.935 --> 33:19.002
Where is the Codex of Paranor?

33:34.619 --> 33:36.019
They're locking off the tunnels.

33:36.087 --> 33:38.087
Which probably means
Wil's gambit didn't work.

33:38.156 --> 33:39.889
And we have no escape plan.

33:39.958 --> 33:41.791
Come on, the cells are this way.

33:44.129 --> 33:45.561
(GASPING)

33:58.543 --> 33:59.709
I know where Allanon is.

34:01.112 --> 34:02.979
Trust me, if we find him, we find Wil.

34:14.059 --> 34:16.326
I guess the longer you live,
the colder your heart gets.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.565
Allanon doesn't give
a damn about anyone.

34:25.603 --> 34:27.603
He didn't care about Amberle,

34:29.373 --> 34:32.108
and he certainly doesn't care about me.

34:37.514 --> 34:40.949
You can drain me dry
and he still won't crack.

34:58.103 --> 35:01.270
- He should be here.
- Who?

35:01.339 --> 35:02.905
Allanon. I can sense his magic.

35:02.974 --> 35:05.141
What are you talking about?
We're wasting time.

35:05.210 --> 35:07.343
- Jax, lead us to the cells.
- Wait.

35:08.079 --> 35:09.445
I swear, I'm not...

35:14.019 --> 35:16.452
(DISTANT CLANGING)

35:25.663 --> 35:27.630
(CLANGING CONTINUES)

35:40.094 --> 35:41.125
(GASPS)

35:55.458 --> 35:56.536
Stop.

35:59.495 --> 36:02.029
I know what you've lost, Wil.

36:02.098 --> 36:03.364
I lost my family, too.

36:04.967 --> 36:06.667
The night the Dagda Mor
attacked Arborlon,

36:06.736 --> 36:10.571
my men were defending the South
Gate, and it was slaughter.

36:12.542 --> 36:15.876
When the Demons were gone
I found my wife flayed.

36:15.945 --> 36:17.778
She was pregnant with our first child.

36:20.416 --> 36:23.617
If it weren't for magic,
they'd still be alive today.

36:27.223 --> 36:29.623
Tell me where the Codex is hidden.

36:30.860 --> 36:32.960
Nobody else has to suffer
the way we have.

36:34.764 --> 36:36.764
He doesn't know anything!

36:38.568 --> 36:39.934
Yes, I do.

36:42.738 --> 36:44.972
But I'd rather die than tell you.

36:46.943 --> 36:48.309
So kill me.

36:50.413 --> 36:51.812
I'm not afraid.

36:58.187 --> 36:59.820
Have it your way.

37:03.693 --> 37:05.025
Drain him.

37:17.940 --> 37:19.106
(SOLDIER GROANS)

37:28.684 --> 37:31.919
Staff has no effect on me.
I'm impervious to magic.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.455
Why don't you give me that,
before you hurt yourself.

37:37.293 --> 37:38.692
You're not impervious to fire.

37:40.463 --> 37:41.495
(GROANS)

37:56.379 --> 37:57.511
ERETRIA: Wil?

38:00.316 --> 38:01.382
Wil.

38:08.191 --> 38:09.490
My staff.

38:11.227 --> 38:12.560
It's not possible.

38:16.566 --> 38:19.200
Hate to break up this family
reunion, but we need to move.

38:19.268 --> 38:20.868
How are we getting out?

38:20.937 --> 38:22.403
I know a way.

38:26.008 --> 38:27.741
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

38:45.595 --> 38:47.022
The Druids escaped into the tunnels!

38:47.029 --> 38:49.230
I want 'em captured.
Now! Seal them off!

38:57.406 --> 38:59.273
We're ready, sir.
Waiting for your command.

39:03.446 --> 39:05.145
(ALL GRUNTING)

39:07.316 --> 39:09.116
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

39:11.756 --> 39:13.647
The ladies and I will
take care of the soldiers.

39:13.654 --> 39:15.089
You, get that gate open.

39:46.656 --> 39:47.687
(GROANS)

40:04.273 --> 40:05.706
Throw me the staff!

40:11.580 --> 40:12.587
(GRUNTING)

40:31.434 --> 40:35.069
What do we do? It would
take 20 of us to open this.

40:35.137 --> 40:36.403
MALE CRIMSON GUARD: Move. Go!

40:40.142 --> 40:41.542
(ALLANON SHOUTING)

41:10.373 --> 41:13.040
I can't hold it! Go!

41:13.109 --> 41:16.210
Go through! Go through!

41:31.494 --> 41:32.960
