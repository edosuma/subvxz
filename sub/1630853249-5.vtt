Hey.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.922
Everything okay?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.592
Can't sleep. Figured
I'd get a jump on work.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.205
I was hoping
it was just me.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.558
He never would've
been here if I had...

05:24.692 --> 05:26.494
If I had just...

05:26.627 --> 05:27.761
Jimmy.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.971
The nuns back in Cicero

05:38.105 --> 05:40.774
would send me to hell
for saying it, but...

05:43.243 --> 05:44.612
...thank God he's dead.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.662
You want some coffee?

06:01.795 --> 06:02.996
Sure.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.332
To-go order?

08:25.873 --> 08:28.508
Got your six-piece
bucket right here.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.944
Thank you. Enjoy.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.515
Welcome.
Can I take your order?

08:35.649 --> 08:38.652
Ah. Sir,
I would be happy
to help you here.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.860
Good afternoon.
May I take your order?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.361
Yeah.

08:48.495 --> 08:53.033
I'd like a 12 piece bucket.
Extra spicy.

08:57.470 --> 09:01.675
May I suggest
our signature spice curls?

09:01.809 --> 09:04.645
Sure.
Gimme a large on that.

09:06.614 --> 09:10.317
Also, two cokes
and a side of coleslaw.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.731
Sorry, Mr. Fring.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.196
We are currently
in the middle of a process
called "discovery."

09:56.329 --> 09:58.431
What is "discovery,"
you might ask?

09:58.565 --> 10:00.567
It's one of the most important
parts of any case

10:00.701 --> 10:01.969
because it's when both parties

10:02.102 --> 10:04.037
are able to "discover,"
if you will,

10:04.171 --> 10:08.441
information that is relevant
to the claims at issue.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.378
Now this brings us to another
key term... "relevance."

10:11.511 --> 10:13.881
If a document or a piece
of evidence is "relevant,"

10:14.014 --> 10:15.415
that means it has a tendency

10:15.548 --> 10:17.417
to prove... or disprove...
an element in the case.

10:17.550 --> 10:21.554
This whole thing is just
takin' so darn long.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.191
Unfortunately, high-stakes
class actions like these

10:24.324 --> 10:25.893
often move on
a protracted timeline.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.561
Well, okay,
but some of us don't have

10:28.696 --> 10:30.931
a "protracted timeline,"
if you know what I mean.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.432
Right?

10:32.565 --> 10:34.467
My son thinks I should
get my own lawyer.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.270
You have every right
to pursue

10:37.404 --> 10:39.239
independent
legal representation.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.908
Having said that...
Uh, absolutely.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.277
It's great to see
the next generation
stepping up, isn't it?

10:44.411 --> 10:45.979
Thank you, Ms. Brill.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.017
Hi, everyone. I'm so glad
to be with you today.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.651
For those of you
who don't know me yet,

10:51.785 --> 10:53.586
I'm your lead attorney...
Howard Hamlin.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.923
Just call me Howard.

10:56.056 --> 10:59.459
And this is my co-counsel,
Cliff Main.

10:59.592 --> 11:03.430
Listen. I know you all want
to get to the finish line.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.998
Boy, I-I sure do.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.100
But I'm gonna level with you.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.668
Truth is,
we still have a ways to go.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.942
Why? Because we want
the maximum from Sandpiper.

11:15.075 --> 11:19.012
We're pushing to get an extra
30% on top of the penalty.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.849
Uh, not because
we're greedy, no.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.817
Because it's what you deserve.

11:25.618 --> 11:29.723
Now, to get your due,
it may take
a little extra time.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.724
Is it worth it?

11:31.825 --> 11:32.625
I think it is.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.296
Because this isn't
just about money.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.366
It's about people.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.669
It's about you.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.237
Sally, right?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.139
Right. Sally.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.541
And you, sir.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.845
We're sending a message...

11:51.979 --> 11:53.881
We're not gonna let
big corporations

11:54.014 --> 11:55.983
pick the pockets
of hard-working folks.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.217
I-I want to live in a world

11:57.350 --> 11:59.219
where people
can trust each other.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.155
And I bet you do, too.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.193
Thanks again, both of you.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.930
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.364
Oh, I feel better.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.900
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.868
Bye.
Okay.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.103
Bye, now.
Thank you.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.337
You take care.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.876
Well, I think we just
put out a major fire.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.344
That was impressive.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.379
Erin, I'll see you
back at the office.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.580
Okay. Bye, Howard.

12:27.714 --> 12:28.748
Howard...
Bye.

12:28.882 --> 12:29.850
...I need a minute.

12:31.484 --> 12:32.719
What's up?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.888
I threw a woman
out of my car.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.291
In the middle
of the street.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.261
And I... Zip, I just drive
right past ya...

12:41.394 --> 12:43.330
That's what you're saying.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.199
No, I-I don't even...

12:46.333 --> 12:48.035
I don't know
how to respond to that.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.569
I'm not asking you
to respond.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.604
I just need you to know
that I know.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.373
It wasn't me, Cliff.
Whoever you think you saw...

12:53.506 --> 12:55.608
Yeah, I'm sorry,
but that's the kinda thing
my son used to say.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.577
It was your Jaguar,
your "Namaste" plate.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.578
It was you!

12:59.746 --> 13:02.816
Howard, there's no harm
in asking for help.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.584
You got a lot of people
in your corner.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.855
So, there's the... the baggie
at the country club.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.257
Yes.
After that, some clients...

13:10.390 --> 13:13.393
Who you can't name
because of privilege...
make insinuations.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.795
Then, on Thursday,
you have a business meeting,

13:15.929 --> 13:18.131
and you witness a Jaguar
speeding past.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.602
Who were you meeting with?

13:22.735 --> 13:26.006
I'm not sure
why that's germane,
but... Kim Wexler.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.241
She came to me
for career advice.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.481
All right.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.587
Okay.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.257
Of course.
Of course.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.031
Cliff, I know
this wasn't easy for you.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.467
You came to me as a friend.
I appreciate it.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.970
You can start <i>today,</i> Howard.
Oh, I will.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.773
Because you're right.
I do have a problem.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.575
Just not the problem
you think.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.044
I have a Jimmy McGill problem.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.778
J-Jimmy McGill?
You'll have to excuse me.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.580
Howard!
Julie.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.417
Cancel my week.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.352
Yes. My <i>whole</i> week.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.311
<i>♪ 'Cause you're
a waste of time for me</i>

14:38.445 --> 14:41.114
<i>♪ I'm trying to make you see ♪</i>

15:30.197 --> 15:31.731
Whoa! Hold up!

15:31.864 --> 15:34.434
Justice will be served
in four and a half minutes.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.136
9:00 a.m. sharp.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.206
I look forward to
sitting down with each
and every one of you.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.177
Morning rush.
So, that's your station.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.579
Temporarily, of course.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.849
But check it out.
Center stage.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.285
What?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.922
That? That...

15:56.056 --> 15:57.257
It's garbagio.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.758
On its way
to the dumpster.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.960
Ha! Ah.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.364
I know that this place
needs a little TLC.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.566
But this is just day one.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.768
Two weeks from now,
you won't recognize it.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.403
Where's Ms. Wexler?

16:11.871 --> 16:14.041
Uh, you mean my wife?

16:14.174 --> 16:16.443
That's right... made
an honest woman out of her.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.978
She's blazing her own trail,
and I couldn't be prouder.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.913
So it's just...

16:21.048 --> 16:23.250
Me. Just me.
For now.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.851
But think of it this way...

16:24.984 --> 16:27.254
Half the work.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.756
What...
What happened
to the old folks?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.158
Elder law?

16:32.959 --> 16:37.064
Uh, I expanded the mission,
uh, to be more inclusive.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.199
Here at Saul Goodman
and Associates,

16:39.332 --> 16:42.435
we welcome all ages,
all creeds, all stripes.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.505
And who is this
Saul Goodman?

16:46.306 --> 16:47.307
You?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.076
You got it!

16:49.209 --> 16:51.078
What Colonel Sanders
is to chicken,

16:51.211 --> 16:52.512
Saul Goodman is
to the law.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.815
Why me?
Because I trust you.

16:55.948 --> 16:59.219
And what happened last time,
I-I-I wanna make it up to ya.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.789
I will explain
at the end of the day.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.857
Please.
You...

17:04.991 --> 17:06.926
You're just desperate
and need a warm body.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.027
Good luck.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.196
Where're you going?

17:09.329 --> 17:10.663
Back to the MVD.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.999
I took half a personal day
for this.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.235
What if I double
your salary?

17:15.368 --> 17:18.638
My salary at the MVD
or what you were
paying me before?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.608
Whatever's less.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.975
No! Whatever's more.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.212
"More" is the word
I'm looking for.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.479
Did I mention...

17:28.481 --> 17:30.317
...the signing bonus?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.492
I get a say
in the decorating.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.264
Open for business.
One at a time.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.732
Thank you.
I'll be right out.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.916
Oh, Viola.
Hey. O-Over here.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.389
Thanks for meeting me.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.657
Of course.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.225
Uh...

18:12.359 --> 18:14.127
I wanted to apologize.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.897
Leaving Schweikart...

18:18.030 --> 18:19.632
I'm sure it looked sudden,

18:19.766 --> 18:23.236
but sorry I left you
in the lurch.

18:24.871 --> 18:28.107
You probably had to
clean up Mesa Verde,

18:28.241 --> 18:30.076
everything
that happened there.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.544
Kevin.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.880
Kevin.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.117
Anyway,
I'm sure it's a lot.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.520
Actually,
Mesa Verde calmed down.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.689
Rich moved me
over to Sandpiper.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.124
Mm. Right.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.494
I think I heard that.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.828
How's it going?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.063
it's pretty interesting
so far.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.366
It's a deep dive
into class action.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.303
Uh, we have our
first mediation session
in a couple of weeks.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.138
Oh. Already?
Who'd you get?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.174
Hope it's not
Roger Patch.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.110
Oh, God. Patch?
With the vegan patties?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.113
What is in those things?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.782
It's gotta be 80% garlic.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.083
So healthy!

19:14.086 --> 19:17.257
No. It-It's not...
It's a new guy.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.691
A retired judge,

19:18.825 --> 19:21.428
who lives up in Santa Fe... Casimiro.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.964
He seems fine,
smells fine.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.600
Well, then,
you dodged a bullet.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.603
I'm glad you called.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.605
Um, I've been wanting
to tell you.

19:32.739 --> 19:36.309
Everyone was so shocked
when you walked away.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.479
I mean,
you were a partner.

19:39.612 --> 19:43.015
I'm sure it seemed very...weird.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.117
It did at first.
But I get it now.

19:45.252 --> 19:48.120
What you're doing to help
the little guy.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.456
It's incredible.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.325
I'm just getting started.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.126
I really admire you, Kim.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.430
Changing direction
like that.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.833
Sometimes,
I question all of it, but...

20:03.870 --> 20:05.705
...you make me feel better
about the law.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.554
Hit and run, 15 minutes.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.657
Shoplifting?
I can, uh,
knock that out in 10.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.025
Yeah, 10.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.995
Hey.
This ain't fine dining, okay?

20:29.128 --> 20:31.398
Our business model
is turning tables.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.833
So, Francesca, I'm here.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.902
Remind me again
why I'm making a house call.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.672
Sounds like money.
Okay. Great.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.973
Great work.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.745
Mr. Ward!

20:49.482 --> 20:51.250
Hey.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.592
I'm an attorney.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.529
I have an appointment
with Mr. Ward.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.034
So, are you Mr. Ward?
Okay.

21:08.167 --> 21:11.304
Well, good evening to you,
whatever your name is.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.424
Hello, Jimmy.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.728
Mr. Ward, I presume.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.900
As in, H.O. Ward.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.570
That is really cute, Howard.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.605
So, wait.
That means, uh...

21:45.738 --> 21:48.641
You're the guy who
"shanked some dude

21:48.775 --> 21:51.344
"in a rumble
near Central Penn"?

21:51.478 --> 21:54.647
That's...
That's very street of you.

21:54.781 --> 21:57.116
I thought it sounded like
a Saul Goodman kind of case.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.454
All right, so,
what're we doing here?

22:01.588 --> 22:03.255
I'm tired, Jimmy.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.959
You and me. Us.
I'm tired of this.

22:07.093 --> 22:10.363
Aren't you?
It's exhausting.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.864
Let's punch it out.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.334
Are you kidding?
I'm dead serious.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.136
Hoping you might get it
out of your system.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.105
Do I think it'll work?
I don't know.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.673
Call it a Hail Mary.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.509
I have the gear.
I rented the ring.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.377
It's just you and me.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.012
And Macky, to ref.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.418
I am sorry, but have you
lost your mind?

22:31.551 --> 22:34.353
Actually, I'm as clear-headed
as I've ever been in my life.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.890
You didn't even try
to hide your tracks.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.192
The baggie of drugs
at the country club.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.694
The clients you sent
to discredit me.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.195
Another prostitute.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.864
Okay, once again, as usual,
I have...

22:44.997 --> 22:46.533
Please.
I could go on.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.935
All roads
lead back to you.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.171
It's Psych 101.
You want to get caught.

22:52.304 --> 22:56.075
So, what, is this...
It's like pistols at dawn?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.710
I'm trying to give you
what you want.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.413
What I want?
I don't...

23:01.781 --> 23:03.115
I think this
is what you want...

23:03.249 --> 23:06.185
You want to beat the shit
out of me, legally?

23:06.318 --> 23:08.855
I think you can
hold up your end.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.323
You must have gotten
into a few good scrapes
in the old neighborhood.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.561
Yeah, right.
I coulda been a contender.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.828
Indulge me.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.831
Let's see what we see.

23:22.535 --> 23:23.636
Thanks for the laughs.

23:25.472 --> 23:26.739
Mr. Ward.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.858
Come on. Right.
Let's go. Come on.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.530
I need you to keep your
mitts up, protect your face.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.164
Tap gloves.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.733
Come on.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.637
G'head.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.975
Come on, Howard.
Come on.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.748
Yeah!
I'm the champ!

24:08.881 --> 24:10.449
Hey! Look at me!

24:11.751 --> 24:13.052
Come on.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.253
Here we go, here we go.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.093
Hit me.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.696
Hey. Take a shot.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.064
Come on.
Take a shot.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.566
Oh!

24:31.037 --> 24:32.471
All right,
all right, all right.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.794
Here we go.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.296
Ohh!

24:59.431 --> 25:00.933
Okay, okay.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.365
You've mistaken my kindness
for weakness.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.469
I'd like to think that
tonight made a difference.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.972
I'd like to think
that this ends it.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.744
Probably not.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.842
How'd it go?

26:15.975 --> 26:19.278
Pretty much as expected.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.579
So...we're on?

26:20.713 --> 26:22.749
Yes.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.517
Anything in particular
you want me to look for?

26:25.652 --> 26:26.886
No.

26:28.688 --> 26:32.759
I need to know
everything he does
and everyone he talks to.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.126
You got it.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.527
Okay, then.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.529
See you Friday.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.252
Ow, ow, ow.

28:40.386 --> 28:44.123
What are you doing?
Put the ice back on it.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.025
Well, I gotta see
if this will work.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.295
I got court first thing
in the morning.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.397
I can't show up
looking like Leon Spinks.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.432
Why not?

28:53.565 --> 28:55.534
I'd say you'd
be missing a bet.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.504
"I'm Saul Goodman... Pow!
I fight for you."

29:03.509 --> 29:06.946
How'd it go with Viola?

29:07.079 --> 29:11.583
I got a name.
Rand Casimiro. Retired judge.

29:11.717 --> 29:12.919
Wow.
You wormed it out of her.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.520
Mm-hmm.
Nice work.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.155
I don't know him,

29:16.288 --> 29:18.524
but I found a picture
in the <i>Bar Journal.</i>

29:28.434 --> 29:30.269
Ah, love the 'stache.

29:30.402 --> 29:33.205
That's a lot less face
to worry about.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.573
Unless he shaves.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.108
Are you kidding?

29:36.242 --> 29:38.310
Those handlebars?
No, that's years of grooming.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.778
True.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.887
"I'll fight for you,"
huh?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.290
Yeah.

30:08.941 --> 30:12.278
I should've left Howard
standing there like a yutz.

30:12.411 --> 30:16.015
Instead, I let him
suck me into his game.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.750
Why'd I do that?

30:20.086 --> 30:22.588
You had your reasons.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.590
I did?

30:24.723 --> 30:25.657
Like what?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.565
Because...

30:33.699 --> 30:34.934
You know.

30:36.602 --> 30:37.769
I know?

30:42.774 --> 30:44.710
You know
what's coming next.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.081
<i>♪ It's not your situation</i>

30:49.215 --> 30:51.450
<i>♪ I just need contemplation</i>

30:51.583 --> 30:53.152
<i>♪ Over you</i>

30:56.688 --> 30:59.225
<i>♪ I'm not so systematic</i>

30:59.358 --> 31:03.162
<i>♪ It's just that I'm an addict
for your love</i>

31:06.465 --> 31:08.667
<i>♪ I'm not the only one
that holds you</i>

31:08.800 --> 31:10.636
<i>♪ I never ever
should have told you</i>

31:10.769 --> 31:14.306
<i>♪ You're my only girl</i>

31:16.342 --> 31:18.510
<i>♪ I'm not the only one
that holds you</i>

31:18.644 --> 31:20.312
<i>♪ I never ever
should have told you</i>

31:20.446 --> 31:23.649
<i>♪ You're my only world ♪</i>

31:50.476 --> 31:52.144
Hey, Mike. Hey.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.515
You good?

31:56.648 --> 31:58.350
Yep. All quiet.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.519
You guys get dinner?

32:00.652 --> 32:01.720
Yeah, we ate.

32:01.853 --> 32:02.621
Mm.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.564
Mm.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.236
Bike at 5:40?

32:17.369 --> 32:19.038
Just a kid
dropping off menus.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.239
It was legit.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.640
Mm-hmm.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.409
He asleep?

32:28.347 --> 32:29.548
All right.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.120
Hey.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.902
Hm.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.408
You know, part of the reason
we set it up this way

32:56.542 --> 32:58.110
is so you can get
some rest.

32:58.244 --> 33:00.412
No news yet, I take it.

33:05.884 --> 33:08.287
It's a waiting game.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.324
Wherever he is now,
sooner or later,

33:12.458 --> 33:14.426
he's gonna end up
right here.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.302
He can't strike.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.736
Not yet.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.432
The other end
of the tunnel is plugged

35:00.566 --> 35:05.704
with 420 cubic yards of dirt,
topped with a cement pad.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.407
No one's coming in
that way.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.513
I can put more guys
on the place,

35:14.646 --> 35:16.382
if that's what
you're thinking.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.557
I'll be upstairs.

38:53.231 --> 38:55.734
Sally Ride...B.

39:05.477 --> 39:06.812
Vodka or gin?

39:06.945 --> 39:10.281
Gimme whatever you'd like.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.384
You American?

39:12.518 --> 39:14.986
I guess you can spot us
a mile away.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.488
Yeah, I'm here
on business.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.356
From California?

39:18.490 --> 39:20.325
No, New Mexico.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.361
It's, uh, another state.

39:23.495 --> 39:27.499
I mean, it's like California,
just less traffic, ya know?

39:30.135 --> 39:32.137
Thank you.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.573
Little town called Jemez.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.041
Jemez?

39:38.877 --> 39:41.079
I almost
visited there once.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.213
Almost?

39:42.347 --> 39:44.516
Mm-hmm. This close.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.553
Well, I'm sorry
you didn't make it.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.722
It's a beautiful place,
the hot springs.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.324
Yes, that's what
I was wanting.

39:53.459 --> 39:57.896
You know, the, um, hmm...
Oh, how do you say?

39:58.029 --> 39:59.498
<i>"Mineralien."</i>

39:59.631 --> 40:01.332
The "minerals"?

40:01.467 --> 40:04.035
Well, it's similar. Yes.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.237
So relaxing
for the muscles.

40:08.974 --> 40:13.011
Well. Maybe you'll get
to go there another time.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.714
No, I don't think so,

40:15.847 --> 40:17.849
but it's a nice idea.

40:21.453 --> 40:24.856
Maybe a trip to Karlovy Vary.
The baths there are wonderful.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.927
To...

40:29.060 --> 40:31.997
Kar-lovy V-Vary?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.432
Vary.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.868
Mm.
Not far from Prague.

40:37.002 --> 40:39.771
Oh. Prague.
Yes, there.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.640
I've always wanted
to go visit there.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.243
I'm Ben.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.778
Ben.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.249
Hello.
I'm Margarethe.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.118
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Margarethe.

40:54.820 --> 40:58.056
I knew his work
was dangerous, but...

40:58.189 --> 41:00.859
I never imagined
such a thing.

41:00.992 --> 41:04.730
Well... I suppose
I tried not to.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.766
That is terrible.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.570
What kind of accident
was it?

41:11.703 --> 41:13.271
A cave-in.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.440
A cave-in?

41:15.574 --> 41:18.476
He was able to save his men.
He got them out.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.647
But then the structure collapsed.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.214
So your husband
was a hero.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.920
He would never accept that.
My Werner was too humble.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.159
What were they
building there?

41:34.292 --> 41:36.628
My husband didn't talk much
about his work.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.530
It was very secretive.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.633
Oh.

41:41.767 --> 41:44.302
I'm sure they must have
told you something.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.137
The lawyers
came to my house.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.973
I asked questions.
They wouldn't say much.

41:50.742 --> 41:51.943
Lawyers.

41:54.079 --> 41:56.682
They went through
Werner's things,

41:56.815 --> 41:59.585
took anything
that they called, uh...

41:59.718 --> 42:01.319
Oh, how do you say it...

42:03.288 --> 42:04.656
"Proprietary"?

42:04.790 --> 42:05.924
I'm sorry.
My English is...

42:06.057 --> 42:08.126
Ah, it's excellent.

42:09.494 --> 42:11.697
I didn't care about it...

42:11.830 --> 42:15.901
All the boxes of folders,
his papers.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.803
Why do I need
all that stuff?

42:21.006 --> 42:23.775
And what about
your husband's men?

42:23.909 --> 42:26.311
I mean, they must've said
something to you.

42:26.444 --> 42:30.649
Werner loved <i>"seine Jungs,"</i>
his boys.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.953
But I never even met them.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.822
What do you mean...
not even at the funeral?

42:38.156 --> 42:40.558
You'd think they'd want
to pay respect

42:40.692 --> 42:43.361
to the man
who saved their lives.

42:43.494 --> 42:46.564
They sent flowers, keepsakes,
and so on.

42:46.698 --> 42:49.000
But not one of them
showed his face.

42:52.370 --> 42:54.505
Wow...

42:54.640 --> 42:57.375
That is...

42:57.508 --> 42:59.845
It's just not right.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.014
Mm.

43:06.885 --> 43:08.687
Let's speak of
something else.

43:10.856 --> 43:13.458
Tell me about New Mexico.

43:16.361 --> 43:18.529
You would love it.

43:18.664 --> 43:20.198
So, how do you say it?

43:20.331 --> 43:23.201
<i>Hoehlenwohnungen.</i>

43:24.870 --> 43:26.437
<i>Hoehl-en-wohn-ungen.</i>

43:26.571 --> 43:27.706
Not bad.
All right? That's...

43:27.839 --> 43:29.374
Not bad.
Yeah?

43:29.507 --> 43:31.609
People don't live
in them anymore,

43:31.743 --> 43:34.045
but for centuries,
they, uh...

43:36.081 --> 43:38.750
Here we are.
My little cave.

43:38.884 --> 43:40.752
It's nice.

43:40.886 --> 43:42.120
So quiet.

43:45.691 --> 43:48.059
Oh, yes, all quiet...

43:50.696 --> 43:52.764
...except for Baerchen.

43:55.934 --> 43:57.468
It means "Little Bear."

44:01.006 --> 44:02.941
I'd like
to invite you in...

44:05.744 --> 44:07.746
...but I have work
in the morning.

44:09.547 --> 44:10.716
Of course.

44:12.718 --> 44:15.353
No. That's not...

44:24.162 --> 44:25.663
When do you fly home?

44:28.299 --> 44:29.667
Tomorrow.

44:30.769 --> 44:33.438
Well, in another life.

44:35.573 --> 44:37.108
In another life, yes.

44:44.615 --> 44:45.550
Good night.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.685
Good night.

46:48.039 --> 46:49.507
<i>Si.</i> Shh, shh, shh.

49:03.574 --> 49:04.875
Hm?
