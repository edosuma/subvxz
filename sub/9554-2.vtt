02:01.255 --> 02:03.246
Pretty good, huh?

02:03.357 --> 02:04.825
Fonz, are you nervous?

02:04.925 --> 02:06.359
Hey, what are you talking about,
nervous?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.985
They're looking
for the next James Dean, right?

02:08.095 --> 02:09.995
Who else are they gonna get?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.703
That don't mean nothin'.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.432
Where's the car?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.668
Fonz! Uh, no,
see, we-we got to go in.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.743
I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.835
(Fonzie sighs)

02:27.981 --> 02:29.881
Fonzarelli.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.246
Oh, it's all right, sir.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.580
He's... he's-he's testing.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.085
Uh, he's one of the testers...

02:34.188 --> 02:35.917
Cunningham, will you
get in here with me?

02:36.023 --> 02:38.014
Right.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.326
All right, where are they?

02:42.429 --> 02:43.658
We're late now!

02:43.764 --> 02:45.994
Bring in the James Deanses!

02:49.903 --> 02:52.304
Good, good. It's about time.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.135
Look what they send me.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.300
All right, you guys,
sit on the bench.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.310
I want to start with you.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.107
Sit on the bench and keep quiet.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.409
Quiet...

03:01.515 --> 03:03.643
on the set!

03:09.423 --> 03:11.619
What are you doing?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.955
Oh, this is called sitting down.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.051
Oh.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.288
Come here. Come here.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.591
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:17.698 --> 03:20.030
Do you see...
do you see this?

03:20.134 --> 03:21.363
Yeah.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.800
D-I-R-E-C... mm...

03:23.904 --> 03:25.372
...T-O-R.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.600
Do you know what that spells?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.699
<i>Yeah. Dirac... tor.</i>

03:30.911 --> 03:32.504
Very good. Very good.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.172
I'm the director,

03:34.281 --> 03:37.717
and no one sits
in this chair but me.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.185
All right, let's move fast.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.756
I got people to meet--
big people, important people.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.221
Where's my lemonade?

03:44.324 --> 03:46.156
It's right here.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.251
Ah, a new kid, huh?

03:48.362 --> 03:50.524
Everybody's after my job.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.100
Hey, uh, how come
we're in a hospital?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.929
Ain't this supposed
to be a park?

03:55.035 --> 03:56.935
Of course it's supposed
to be a park.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.062
Where's the park?!

04:00.240 --> 04:01.969
Come on, don't play
with those rocks.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.236
Put 'em down.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.107
Screen tests, screen tests.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.510
War pictures, war pictures.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.208
I love doing war pictures.

04:10.317 --> 04:13.753
Did you ever see
Naked and the Dead?

04:13.854 --> 04:14.980
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, cool picture.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.214
Wonderful movie.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.724
They wouldn't let me do it.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.022
They wouldn't even
let me see it.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.596
Ah, it's my life.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.688
The screen test actor
didn't show up today.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.062
Hey, wait a minute, Rollo-.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.761
Why don't you let
Richie Cunningham here do it?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.269
Who?

04:31.371 --> 04:33.533
Well, yeah,
I suppose that I could do it.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.472
Uh, you see, sir,
I know the lines

04:35.576 --> 04:37.874
because I've been rehearsing
with Fonzie.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.208
After everybody's job, huh?

04:40.314 --> 04:41.406
Okay, get ready!

04:41.515 --> 04:42.448
(buzzer sounds)

04:42.549 --> 04:43.812
Roll the cameras!

04:43.917 --> 04:45.783
(camera whirring)

04:45.886 --> 04:46.819
Action!

04:46.920 --> 04:50.220
All right, Rich, take it away.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.421
The cops are looking for you.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.052
When are you gonna learn?

04:55.162 --> 04:56.687
Learn. I'm learning.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.664
It is a rough world out there,
and I'm going to get me a piece

04:59.766 --> 05:02.098
if I have to use my bare hands
or not, dig it?

05:02.202 --> 05:04.637
Always using your fists.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.036
You're learning nothing, Bucko.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.837
One of these days, your fists--

05:11.945 --> 05:14.414
they're gonna get you
in a lot of trouble!

05:15.716 --> 05:17.684
- That was very good, Rich.
- Oh, thanks.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.775
(Richie clears his throat)

05:21.188 --> 05:23.418
You want to know something
about my fists?

05:23.523 --> 05:25.287
I'm going to the top,
and these...

05:25.392 --> 05:27.224
these are gonna pave the way.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.761
Oh, you're stupid, Bucko.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.193
Heyyy!

05:30.297 --> 05:32.391
You think you get to the top
with your fists?

05:32.499 --> 05:33.728
It's not with your fists.

05:33.834 --> 05:34.892
I'll tell you how
you get somewhere.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.697
With this--
with your brain.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.362
Yeah, that's how much you know.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.463
You know, brains,
they don't shut up a squealer.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.633
Brains, they don't keep
a gang in order.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.711
Huh! You know what you need?
You need power!

05:44.811 --> 05:47.712
And I'm gonna get some power!

05:49.783 --> 05:52.047
Boy, you really do that
very well.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.642
Thank you.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.222
- Power!
- Yeah.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.916
(Richie clears his throat)

05:59.960 --> 06:01.928
You're never
gonna understand, are you?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.519
You just will never understand.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.189
Hey, let me
tell you something, Mel.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.391
I ain't doing so bad.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.729
I'm going to the top.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.734
I'm going to the... top.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.736
You'll probably make it...

06:11.838 --> 06:13.237
if you live that long, Bucko.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.671
Hey.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.901
I'm telling you one thing.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.443
What's that, Mel?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.376
I'm going
to be up there with you.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.504
Brains... and power.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.083
Yeah.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.810
POMPOON:
Cut!

06:24.918 --> 06:26.477
- Print!
-(buzzer sounds)

06:26.586 --> 06:27.883
You were wonderful!

06:27.988 --> 06:29.080
You were fantastic!

06:29.189 --> 06:30.486
You were stupendous!

06:30.590 --> 06:33.560
Oh, it's going to be you and me,
babe, right to the top!

06:33.660 --> 06:35.628
Anything that
I can do for you, just ask.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.094
Anything! Anything!

06:37.197 --> 06:39.359
Oh, we didn't have breakfast.
Could we have a sandwich?

06:39.466 --> 06:40.592
You got it.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.829
You got a sandwich,
you got anything you want.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.927
You probably got my job.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.270
Let's take a five-minute break.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.967
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.306
I'm telling you, Fonz,
you-you were really boffo.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.537
What did you just say?

06:52.646 --> 06:53.807
Oh, no, that's good.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.972
It-It's a Hollywood word.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.107
- Ah.
- Yeah.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.413
(Richie sighs, sniffs, groans)

07:09.730 --> 07:11.755
Mm.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.830
(no voice)

07:22.309 --> 07:24.300
(boat engine humming)

07:46.666 --> 07:47.997
I can't believe it.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.591
Our Richie.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.637
I can. Oh!

07:51.738 --> 07:53.137
Well, where is he?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.867
Oh, he's down with Fonzie

07:54.975 --> 07:56.670
practicing
for the water skiing race.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.575
I sent Joanie down to get him.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.375
What's up? I got to practice
driving the boat.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.642
Oh, Richard.

08:02.749 --> 08:03.875
Mom, what are you doing?

08:03.984 --> 08:07.147
MARION: Oh, Richard,
lam so proud of you!

08:07.254 --> 08:08.722
-(Marion squeals happily)
-(laughs): Yeah, that's nice.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.586
-(Richie chuckles)
- Oh, if you knew.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.419
Something has happened.
We just can't wait to tell you.

08:12.526 --> 08:13.652
This is the most exciting thing.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.819
Dad, what is going on?
I don't understand.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.829
Marion, would you just
calm down, please?

08:17.931 --> 08:19.262
Mother gets carried away
sometimes.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.458
Yes. (laughs)

08:20.567 --> 08:22.934
You see, Richard,
the studio called, and...

08:23.036 --> 08:25.471
Marion... sit.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.563
(Marion laughs)

08:29.543 --> 08:32.342
The studio called to say
that they saw the screen test,

08:32.446 --> 08:35.143
and they were very impressed
with you.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.817
(Richie laughs)

08:39.852 --> 08:41.787
They were... (laughs)

08:41.888 --> 08:43.686
- They were impressed with me?
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.258
Oh, they were...

08:45.358 --> 08:46.587
- You're not kidding?
- No.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.092
- Oh...!
- Yeah, just think of it.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.823
Your footprints in cement,
a big mansion.

08:50.931 --> 08:54.526
Oh, Richard, now promise me
that you won't change your name.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.626
Marion... I told you to sit!

08:57.737 --> 08:59.068
I'll just stand over here.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.368
All right, all right,
picture this, picture this:

09:01.475 --> 09:04.206
Bucko Cunningham!

09:04.311 --> 09:06.712
Oh, Howard,
he'll change his name.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.508
Well, I just can't believe this.

09:08.615 --> 09:10.447
L-I could really be
a movie star.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.848
Yeah, well, they...
I think it's just terrific.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.217
You know, they said
that they liked the screen test,

09:15.322 --> 09:17.518
and they were very much
interested in you.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.956
But, uh... there is something
else we have to tell you.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.791
- Yeah?
- This is just like the movies.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.388
They're sending over a contract.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.557
They're sending a con...?

09:26.666 --> 09:27.895
- There's gonna be a contract?
- Mm-hmm.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.732
Oh, my... oh, my gosh. Oh.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.100
Hey, hey, you know...

09:32.205 --> 09:33.764
You know what I bet
they're gonna do?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.433
They're gonna put Fonzie
and me in a movie together.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.600
Wouldn't that be great?

09:36.710 --> 09:37.768
Hey, I've even got an idea.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.277
We could do...
we could do a film, uh,

09:39.379 --> 09:41.780
like Rebel Without a Cause--
what a great picture.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.180
Well, it's a little too soon
for a remake. Forget that.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.581
Okay, we'll do a Western.
It'll be much better.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.016
(imitating gunfire)

09:47.120 --> 09:48.178
- Oh, Howard, tell him. -RICHIE:
Cut 'em off at the pass.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.188
Rope them doggies. (whoops)

09:50.290 --> 09:51.951
Richard...

09:52.058 --> 09:54.356
- You still in town, Pa?
- Uh, Richard?

09:54.461 --> 09:55.656
I thought
I told you to get out.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.787
- Richard!
- Yeah, Dad?

09:57.898 --> 10:00.765
They're not interested
in Fonzie.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.029
Oh... Oh, yeah.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.501
He's the new James Dean.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.368
Oh, he was great
in that test, Dad.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.531
You should have seen him.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.542
Power!

10:10.644 --> 10:14.103
Well, they say
that they're tired of his type.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.943
- Tired of his type?!
- Mm-hmm.

10:16.049 --> 10:20.282
They say you have a face that
makes people think of apple pie.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.186
Yeah...
Yeah, I-I've heard that.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.249
In fact, they described it

10:26.359 --> 10:29.454
as a kind of disturbed
apple pie face.

10:29.563 --> 10:31.395
Well, yeah, with these freckles.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.727
Uh, you know.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.322
That's the new trend.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.994
Warner Brothers just signed
some kid-- what's his name?

10:37.103 --> 10:39.037
Troy Donahue.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.698
Well, it-it's... it's great.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.367
It's... it's really
flattering, but...

10:43.476 --> 10:45.240
how can they just do that
to Fonzie?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.177
You know how excited
he was about it.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.477
Oh, Richard, this is
a mother's dream come true.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.052
But poor Arthur.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.984
I feel so sorry for him.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.577
It's going to break his heart.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.952
And-and who's gonna tell him?

10:57.057 --> 10:59.321
You want us to tell him?

10:59.426 --> 11:01.918
Well, no, I...
I think I'll do it.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.154
HOWARD:
Mm.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.163
You want to talk about this?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.962
No, I'm in college now;
I'll-I'll work it out.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.059
I'll tell him.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.796
But he's not a man
who takes bad news well.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.808
(boat engine revving)

11:56.916 --> 11:59.681
How am I gonna tell him?

11:59.786 --> 12:02.050
Fonz...

12:02.155 --> 12:04.385
Hey, friend of the stars!

12:04.491 --> 12:05.822
Man I wanted to see.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.757
Why don't you just tell me...

12:07.861 --> 12:11.058
what are my rave reviews
on the, uh, screen test?

12:11.164 --> 12:13.223
Fonz, you really...
you really skied well!

12:13.333 --> 12:15.392
- FONZIE: Yeah. -Well, you were
a little shaky at first,

12:15.502 --> 12:16.628
but you mastered it fast.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.534
You know, I really think
you have a chance

12:18.638 --> 12:20.197
at beating
that California Kid today.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.173
Yeah, they say I got a gift,

12:22.275 --> 12:25.040
but what I'm interested in
are the rave reviews on my test.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.772
How'd that go? Tell me.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.746
Oh, that, yeah.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.475
Well, uh...

12:30.583 --> 12:31.550
the film came back...

12:31.651 --> 12:32.812
Yeah?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.887
...and it's okay. (laughs)

12:34.988 --> 12:36.456
You're such a kidder, huh?

12:36.556 --> 12:41.494
What-what I want to know is,
when is my career starting?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.553
(Richie chuckles nervously)

12:46.499 --> 12:49.332
- You know, show biz...
- Yeah... (chuckles)

12:49.436 --> 12:52.337
- It-It's such a crazy business.
- Yeah.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.875
The ups... and the downs.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.340
I can dig it, I can dig it.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.536
The ups, the downs.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.376
- Yeah.
- The downs.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.041
Tell me about the downs.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.380
(clears throat)
Well, uh,

13:06.486 --> 13:08.477
the studio called.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.382
I didn't get the contract.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.125
I didn't get the contract.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.563
Fonz...

13:26.673 --> 13:28.163
are you okay?

13:28.274 --> 13:30.902
Yeah, yeah.
Sure I'm okay.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.570
We had a great trip
to California.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.980
I still got my job, you know,
the garage in Milwaukee.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.314
We can all go home again
together, you know.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.321
Yeah... yeah, uh, but, Fonz...

13:43.423 --> 13:46.654
Yeah, let's go and, uh,
win that water ski contest.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.957
Y-You still feel like skiing,
even after the news?

13:52.399 --> 13:55.494
Look, Cunningham, I told you,
everything is just fine.

13:55.602 --> 13:59.505
So I'm not the next James Dean.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.541
Why not?! Why not me?!

14:08.281 --> 14:11.182
Well, maybe it's-it's just
because, uh...

14:12.585 --> 14:13.416
Well, I'm not sure.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.851
May... uh, it could be...

14:14.954 --> 14:16.513
Wasn't I any good?

14:16.623 --> 14:18.318
No... No, of course
you were good.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.018
Eh.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.356
No, you were,
you were very good.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.022
Fonzie...

14:25.131 --> 14:27.691
I think that-that maybe
they were just going

14:27.801 --> 14:30.498
for a-a different kind
of a-a look.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.935
Oh, what do they want now?

14:37.243 --> 14:38.267
Freckles.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.338
Well, I could paint those on.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.384
APP“! pie face.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.782
Well, that's you.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.944
That's who they want.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.319
You?

14:53.426 --> 14:54.916
Yeah, well, they, uh...

14:55.028 --> 14:57.656
The guys in the studio called,
and they...

14:57.764 --> 15:01.064
they're interested in
"disturbed apple pie face."

15:01.167 --> 15:03.727
You?!

15:03.837 --> 15:06.568
Well, I guess they think
that that's-that's me. Uh...

15:06.673 --> 15:08.801
You?!

15:10.009 --> 15:11.738
It was all...
it was all an accident, Fonz.

15:11.845 --> 15:12.812
It was just a fluke.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.505
(Richie chuckles nervously)

15:14.614 --> 15:16.446
You're not mad
or anything, are you?

15:22.622 --> 15:24.283
Look, Rich...

15:26.092 --> 15:26.991
(scoffs)

15:27.093 --> 15:28.686
you're my best fr...

15:33.933 --> 15:36.425
I couldn't be happier for you.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.970
Aw, thanks, Fonz.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.800
Hey, look, I don't know for sure
what I'm gonna do,

15:39.906 --> 15:41.271
so don't tell
the guys yet, okay?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.364
Oh, you got it.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.136
Okay, I'll drive you down there.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.713
- Let's go skiing!
- Oh, no, look, uh,

15:46.813 --> 15:48.406
maybe Ralph should drive me.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.949
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna drive.
Remember we talked

15:50.049 --> 15:51.949
-just a few hours ago...
- I don't think you can drive me.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.520
Big stars don't drive, Rich.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.180
Besides, you don't want to get

15:56.289 --> 16:00.157
that apple pie face
of yours wet.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.696
I'll catch you later, big star.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.357
Oh...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.797
Malph, you sure you know how
to drive one of these things?

16:14.908 --> 16:17.468
Are you kidding?
My middle name's Moby Dick.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.102
POTSIE:
I thought it was Hector.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.577
- Hector?
-(all laughing)

16:20.680 --> 16:22.978
All right, look, take me over
to the dock, will you?

16:23.082 --> 16:24.208
Let's get over there.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.910
All right, Fonz,
I'm gonna drive! I get to drive!

16:26.019 --> 16:28.249
- Will you drive the boat, Malph?
- Aye, aye, sir.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.982
- I'll make this thing
stand on end. -Yeah, right.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.222
FONZIE:
Malph, what did you do?!

16:38.331 --> 16:41.323
POTSIE:
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

16:45.805 --> 16:47.102
Fonz.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.698
Rich, it's about time.
The race is about to start.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.709
Nancy said you wanted
to talk to me.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.041
I didn't say "talk." Pots?

16:54.147 --> 16:58.243
- Yeah, Fonz? -Tell the redhead
he's driving the boat. Get in.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.978
But, Fonz,
I thought I was driving.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.783
Malph, you nearly drowned
a lifeguard.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.789
Come on, Fonz,
one little mistake.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.119
He didn't get hurt.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.922
Tell him to make sure
the gas tank is full.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.723
Yeah, but, Fonz,
Richie's standing right here.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.059
I'm sure he heard you.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.859
Tell him.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.332
Uh, Rich,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.869
- Fonz wants to make sure the...
- Potsie, I heard him.

17:17.971 --> 17:19.962
I got ears.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.704
(horn honks)

17:22.809 --> 17:24.800
(girls squealing)

17:29.616 --> 17:32.313
Hey, who's the dodo
with the California Kid?

17:32.418 --> 17:34.477
WENDY:
That's Georgie. He's the driver.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.487
What's with the bathrobe?
He just get up?

17:36.589 --> 17:38.557
Oh, that--
he pretends to be Jack Benny.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.558
What a weirdo!

17:40.660 --> 17:43.391
I got over the Jack Benny phase
when I was 17.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.629
Well... here we are.

17:48.735 --> 17:52.365
Oh, uh, this is my driver,
Georgie.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.373
(as Jack Benny): Hello, Fonz,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.704
(laughs)

17:58.077 --> 18:01.377
That is a very beautiful
blue robe you got on.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.348
- It matches my eyes.
-(laughter)

18:04.450 --> 18:07.647
Well, the Fonz is ready
to match the California Kid.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.654
Oh, that's nice, farm boy.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.726
Uh, before I embarrass you
in front of your friends,

18:12.825 --> 18:15.385
why don't you go move
a pile of manure?

18:15.495 --> 18:16.656
<i>CROWD:
Ooh . . .:!</i>

18:24.003 --> 18:26.563
- I just did.
-(laughter)

18:26.673 --> 18:29.074
- Good one.
- That's great, Fonz. (chuckles)

18:29.175 --> 18:30.700
CALIFORNIA KID:
Let's get started.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.075
Here... I wrote down the rules
of the contest.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.741
Listen, we go
through the course.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.080
The one who does it the fastest,

18:40.186 --> 18:42.086
-wins.
- Gotcha.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.747
A neutral observer will ride
in each boat

18:43.856 --> 18:45.756
to make sure
there's no cheating.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.383
I pick, uh...

18:47.493 --> 18:49.018
him.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.620
I pick her.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.563
(crowd oohing)

18:53.666 --> 18:55.225
That's my girl.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.099
Not a bad choice.

18:58.204 --> 19:01.071
My girl doesn't observe.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.801
Correctamundo.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.139
I'll observe her.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.235
(laughter)

19:09.716 --> 19:10.979
Come on, man,
we got a race to win.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.916
Get that junk in the boat.
Come on, shake it! Get in there!

19:13.019 --> 19:14.145
- Come on!
- Well!

19:14.253 --> 19:17.348
I hope Rochester doesn't hear
about this.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.309
Hey, look out!
It's a banana peel!

19:36.409 --> 19:37.808
(laughter)

20:03.436 --> 20:04.335
20 seconds!

20:04.437 --> 20:05.598
That's the best
he's ever done.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.332
This could be a contest.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.204
I just hope I can maneuver
the boat okay.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.072
Hey, are you kidding?
Of course you can.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.077
Movie stars can do anything.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.170
Let's go, Rich.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.848
(boat engine revving)

20:26.993 --> 20:28.290
Come on, Fonz!

20:40.773 --> 20:42.434
He almost fell!

20:43.843 --> 20:46.471
(all cheering)

21:03.329 --> 21:05.991
-20 seconds! It's a tie!
-(all cheering)

21:11.404 --> 21:12.667
- Oh, Fonz, you were great!
- The California Kid is through!

21:12.772 --> 21:14.638
- That looked so terrific!
- He's through, the Kid!

21:14.740 --> 21:16.105
- We're so proud of you!
-(girls squealing)

21:16.209 --> 21:17.734
- That was the best!
- All right, Fonz!

21:17.844 --> 21:19.209
Is he not the greatest?

21:19.312 --> 21:22.543
(girls chattering, giggling)

21:22.648 --> 21:24.616
Hey, listen, I'm gonna go talk
to Cunningham, huh?

21:24.717 --> 21:26.207
Oh, sure, Fonz, just tell me
what you want to say

21:26.319 --> 21:27.809
-and I'll relay it.
- Alone.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.615
Oh, okay, Fonz.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.029
I want to tell you something,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.331
you drove that boat
pretty good, Cunningham.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.338
You're talking to me.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.272
Couldn't have done it
without you.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.002
Oh, sure, you could've, Fonz.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.010
Hey, true.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.204
Jesting, jesting.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.508
It was a joke.

21:55.615 --> 21:58.414
So, uh, you're not upset
about the, uh,

21:58.517 --> 22:00.713
screen test and-and everything?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.117
Let me tell you something--

22:02.221 --> 22:05.452
I realized something about
my being a star, Cunningham.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.492
It was never meant to be.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.618
I mean, the fact
that you and your, uh,

22:09.729 --> 22:13.097
disturbed apple pie face there
is gonna be famous one day

22:13.199 --> 22:15.224
doesn't rile me at all.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.895
As a matter of fact, it makes me
feel very good for you.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.973
Just do me one favor.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.440
You go out there
and you get 'em, huh?

22:23.542 --> 22:26.239
That motor head
is making me mad.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.245
I know, kid, but, you know,

22:28.347 --> 22:31.908
Jenny here, who reminds me
a lot of Mary,

22:32.018 --> 22:36.819
just told me that your worthy
opponent is afraid of sharks.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.448
So?

22:38.557 --> 22:40.992
So... you know
that shark caged up

22:41.093 --> 22:43.323
-by the jumping ramp over there?
- Yeah.

22:43.429 --> 22:46.660
Well, all you got to do
is challenge this Fonz guy

22:46.766 --> 22:49.428
to jump over the shark, you see.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.338
He'll back down,
and you'd beat him

22:53.439 --> 22:56.272
without even leaving the dock,
you see.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.606
Gosh, I'm clever, you know?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.771
(chuckling):
Hey...

23:01.881 --> 23:03.440
I love it.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.314
Go get the ramp moved.

23:21.367 --> 23:22.801
You up for a real challenge?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.701
The Fonz never ignores
a challenge.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.569
We both make one jump...

23:27.673 --> 23:29.471
any way you want.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.043
Child's play, huh, Malph?

23:31.143 --> 23:32.668
- Child's play.
- Right.

23:32.778 --> 23:34.746
There's only one condition:

23:34.847 --> 23:37.009
we jump an obstacle.

23:37.116 --> 23:41.019
Well, let's make it something
big, you know, like your head.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.485
-(laughter)
- RALPH: Good one!

23:42.588 --> 23:44.488
Oh, it's big, all right.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.957
It's the shark.

23:52.465 --> 23:53.557
That's stupid.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.566
Why would somebody
want to jump a shark?

23:55.668 --> 23:56.567
Are you chicken?

23:56.669 --> 23:59.331
(chuckles)
The Fonz, chicken?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.668
Absurd! Absolutely absurd!

24:01.774 --> 24:03.333
The Fonz will accept
your challenge.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.466
Hold it, Malph, hold it!

24:04.577 --> 24:05.942
We're talking sharks here.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.945
Hey, man, you're not afraid
of a little shark, are you?

24:08.047 --> 24:09.947
- Well, how little?
- Of course the Fonz isn't afraid

24:10.049 --> 24:12.017
of a little shark.
The Fonz knows no fear.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.517
Right, Fonz?

24:13.619 --> 24:15.451
- Yeah, yeah...
- See?

24:15.554 --> 24:17.613
The Fonz is gonna jump
that shark.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.350
Oh, I love sharks!

24:19.458 --> 24:20.892
Ooh, a real shark!

24:20.993 --> 24:22.757
Ooh, Fonzie, Fonzie!
You gonna do it?

24:22.862 --> 24:24.762
Yeah, yeah, of course
I'm gonna do it.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.764
(girls squeal, laugh)

24:26.866 --> 24:28.857
(quietly):
A real shark.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.065
I hope it's female.
