WEBVTT

00:11.533 --> 00:13.667
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.700 --> 00:15.600
SO HOW DID YOUR TEST GO?
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT IT,

00:15.633 --> 00:17.133
BUT I WON'T KNOW
FOR A FEW DAYS.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.667
WELL, WE'RE ALL PULLING
FOR YOU.
WE ARE?

00:18.700 --> 00:24.167
YOU CANNOT KICK ME
WHILE I'M DOING MY JOB.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.133
I THOUGHT YOU COULD GIVE ME
AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION

00:26.167 --> 00:30.100
ABOUT YOU...
MOVING IN.

00:31.733 --> 00:34.100
I HAVE A DOG.
THAT'S NOT A DOG.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.567
IT'S A HYENA, ESCAPED FROM
THE ZOO DRESSED IN DOG CLOTHING.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.033
I LOVE DOGS.

00:38.067 --> 00:39.500
***

00:39.533 --> 00:42.033
(Meredith) AS DOCTORS,
WE ARE TRAINED TO BE SKEPTICAL

00:42.067 --> 00:45.200
BECAUSE OUR PATIENTS
LIE TO US ALL THE TIME.

00:45.233 --> 00:46.400
THE RULE IS,

00:46.433 --> 00:50.367
EVERY PATIENT'S A LIAR
UNTIL PROVEN HONEST.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.700
***

00:54.733 --> 00:56.633
WHY AREN'T YOU
PREPPING FOR ROUNDS

00:56.667 --> 00:58.633
AND STEALING
ALL THE GOOD CASES?

00:58.667 --> 01:00.267
WELL, WHY AREN'T YOU
PREPPING FOR ROUNDS

01:00.300 --> 01:02.800
AND STEALING
ALL THE GOOD CASES?
NO REASON.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.467
NO REASON.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.700
LYING IS BAD...

01:05.733 --> 01:07.467
OR SO WE'RE TOLD,

01:07.500 --> 01:09.533
CONSTANTLY, FROM BIRTH.

01:09.567 --> 01:12.167
HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.500
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.533
I CHOPPED DOWN
THE CHERRY TREE.

01:16.567 --> 01:17.500
WHATEVER.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.067
I'M WAITING FOR McDREAMY.

01:19.067 --> 01:20.400
I'M AVOIDING BURKE.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.700
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING
BURKE?

01:22.733 --> 01:24.633
(sighs) HE THINKS
I MOVED IN WITH HIM.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.600
WHY ARE YOU WAITING FOR--
McDREAMY'S DOING ME
A FAVOR.

01:26.633 --> 01:28.567
BURKE "THINKS"
YOU MOVED IN WITH HIM?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.333
WAIT, YOU'RE CALLING HIM
"McDREAMY" AGAIN?

01:30.367 --> 01:32.367
THE FACT IS,
LYING IS A NECESSITY.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.333
***

01:36.667 --> 01:38.567
(Meredith)
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS,

01:38.600 --> 01:40.200
WITH THE NEEDLES
AND THE BLOOD.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.133
THEY WON'T ACCEPT HER
WITHOUT A FULL FAMILY HISTORY.

01:42.167 --> 01:44.700
I'M HAPPY TO GET YOUR MOM
INTO THE CLINICAL TRIAL,

01:44.733 --> 01:46.567
EVEN WITH THE NEEDLES
AND BLOOD.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.600
***

01:50.633 --> 01:52.667
ALL DONE.
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

01:52.700 --> 01:56.500
WE LIE TO OURSELVES
BECAUSE THE TRUTH...

01:56.533 --> 01:58.200
THE TRUTH FREAKING HURTS.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.233
IT FEELS GOOD.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.267
BURKE "THINKS"
YOU MOVED IN WITH HIM.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.800
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

02:03.833 --> 02:05.167
OKAY, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.100
YOU'RE CALLING DEREK
"McDREAMY" AGAIN.

02:07.133 --> 02:08.633
IT'S NOTHING.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.567
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:10.600 --> 02:11.767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:11.800 --> 02:13.467
STOP REPEATING
WHAT I SAY.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.667
STOP ASKING ME QUESTIONS.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.400
(pounding on glass)

02:16.433 --> 02:19.700
CUJO HAS TO GO!

02:19.733 --> 02:22.367
HE PEED ON MY BED.
MY BED, MEREDITH.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.333
HE'S OUR DOG.
NO, HE'S NOT MY DOG.

02:24.367 --> 02:26.833
YOU TWO BOUGHT HIM
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.833
WE RESCUED HIM
FROM CERTAIN DEATH.

02:28.867 --> 02:31.667
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.067
I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.

02:33.067 --> 02:35.600
EITHER THE DOG MOVES OUT,
OR I DO.

02:35.633 --> 02:38.200
FOOT DOWN NOW.

02:38.233 --> 02:41.067
ME OR THE DOG,
WHICH IS IT?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.633
YOU HESITATED.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.167
SHE HESITATED!

02:48.200 --> 02:49.533
YOU HESITATED?

02:49.567 --> 02:52.200
I DIDN'T HESITATE.
I WAS THINKING.

02:52.233 --> 02:54.133
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT?

02:54.167 --> 02:56.367
FINE.
I'M MOVING OUT RIGHT NOW.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.700
LATER, I'M MOVING OUT LATER

02:57.733 --> 02:59.733
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE ROUNDS.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.400
TELL ME THAT IS NOT A DOG.

03:05.433 --> 03:08.200
(Alex and Cristina)
IT'S NOT A DOG.
(pager beeps)

03:08.233 --> 03:12.133
RICK FREEARK, HE'S 29. SEVERED
3 FINGERS ON HIS LEFT HAND.

03:12.167 --> 03:13.500
CONTROLLED THE BLEEDING
IN THE FIELD.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.833
VITALS STABLE. GAVE HIM 5
OF MORPHINE ON THE WAY IN.

03:15.867 --> 03:17.767
THE FINGERS?
I HAD SOME TROUBLE
RETRIEVING THEM,

03:17.800 --> 03:19.433
SO WE TOOK OFF.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.367
RIG BEHIND US FOUND 'EM.
THEY'RE ICED AND READY TO GO.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.300
TEN MINUTES OUT.
GREAT.
CONTINUE WITH I.V. FLUIDS

03:23.333 --> 03:25.433
AND START A COURSE
OF ANTIBIOTICS.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.400
YANG, YOU WAIT OUTSIDE
FOR THE FINGERS.
YES!

03:27.433 --> 03:28.633
YOU CAN SEW 'EM
BACK ON, RIGHT?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.533
'CAUSE THEY SEWED THAT GUY'S
PENIS BACK ON

03:30.567 --> 03:32.467
AFTER HIS WIFE
CHOPPED IT OFF, RIGHT?

03:32.500 --> 03:34.400
PENISES AND FINGERS ARE
LIKE APPLES AND ORANGES.

03:34.433 --> 03:37.467
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
I WAS LOADING MY GEAR
ONTO THE TRUCK FOR A GIG,

03:37.500 --> 03:40.100
AND THEY GOT CAUGHT
IN THE LIFT GATE.
YOU'RE A MUSICIAN?

03:40.133 --> 03:41.700
I PLAY THE FREAKIN' GUITAR.

03:41.733 --> 03:43.067
YOU CAN SEW 'EM
BACK ON, RIGHT?

03:43.067 --> 03:45.367
THIS IS NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL, RIGHT?

03:45.400 --> 03:49.167
OH, DUDE, I BETTER NOT
BE OUT OF THE BAND.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.500
(Derek) WELL, THE CUTS
LOOK CLEAN. THAT'S GOOD.

03:56.533 --> 03:59.133
A CLEAN SEVER
MAKES REATTACHMENT EASIER.

03:59.167 --> 04:01.067
NOW I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU,

04:01.100 --> 04:02.833
IF THE SURGERY
IS SUCCESSFUL,

04:02.867 --> 04:05.333
WE'RE LOOKING AT
A LONG RECOVERY

04:05.367 --> 04:06.700
WITH LOTS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY.

04:06.733 --> 04:08.733
DO YOU SMOKE?

04:08.767 --> 04:09.733
WHY?

04:09.767 --> 04:12.600
CIGARETTE SMOKE
CONSTRICTS THE BLOOD VESSELS.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.700
I'VE SEEN REALLY GOOD GRAFTS
FAIL OVER A FEW CIGARETTES.

04:14.733 --> 04:16.400
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

04:16.433 --> 04:18.333
I-I SMOKE A CIGARETTE
AFTER MY OPERATION,

04:18.367 --> 04:20.500
AND--AND, BOOM,
MY FINGERS FALL OFF?

04:20.533 --> 04:22.233
NO, FIRST THEY TURN
BLACK AND NECROTIC,

04:22.267 --> 04:24.267
AND THEN THEY FALL OFF.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.433
WELL... I DON'T SMOKE,
SO...

04:28.467 --> 04:29.833
REALLY?

04:29.867 --> 04:31.767
'CAUSE JUDGING BY
THE NICOTINE STAINS,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.200
YOUR FINGERS DO.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.767
OOH...

04:35.800 --> 04:37.700
(woman) ANYBODY OUT THERE?

04:37.733 --> 04:41.133
* HELLO

04:41.167 --> 04:42.500
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.767
SHE HAD HIP REPLACEMENT SURGERY
A MONTH AGO

04:44.800 --> 04:47.233
AND WAS DISCHARGED
LAST WEEK.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.400
THEN WHY IS SHE STILL HERE?

04:48.433 --> 04:52.833
BECAUSE I AM NOT A BOUNCER
AND THIS IS NOT A NIGHTCLUB.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.200
I AM DOING WHAT I CAN

04:54.233 --> 04:56.133
WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED
STAFF AND RESOURCES,

04:56.167 --> 04:58.567
AND IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT,

04:58.600 --> 05:01.800
TAKE IT UP
WITH THE CHIEF.

05:01.833 --> 05:05.433
(woman)
* DON'T KNOW WHY

05:05.467 --> 05:07.333
* THERE'S NO SUN
UP IN THE SKY *

05:07.367 --> 05:08.600
* STORMY WEATHER...

05:08.633 --> 05:10.067
MRS. LARSON'S GOT TO GO.

05:10.067 --> 05:13.167
IF SHE REFUSES TO LEAVE,
WHAT CAN I DO?
SHE'S 78 AND NONAMBULATORY.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.400
YOU HAVE THE UPPER HAND HERE.
USE IT.

05:15.433 --> 05:17.500
OH, KAREV, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

05:19.300 --> 05:22.267
THE RESULTS OF
YOUR MEDICAL BOARD EXAMS.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.767
WH--

05:27.667 --> 05:29.333
AREN'T YOU GONNA
OPEN IT?

05:29.367 --> 05:30.700
YEAH, I'LL OPEN IT.

05:32.767 --> 05:38.067
* I'M WEARY ALL THE TIME

05:39.567 --> 05:41.433
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.133
OKAY, MRS. LARSON,
I'M DR. O'MALLEY.

05:43.167 --> 05:45.200
OH, AN IRISHMAN.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.500
I LOVE THE IRISH.
THEY HAVE A--

05:47.533 --> 05:48.733
A SPARKLE.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.500
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE EYE
AND THE SWAGGER.

05:51.533 --> 05:55.067
COME ON, DR. O'MALLEY,
SHOW ME THE SWAGGER.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.067
THE EYES ARE RIGHT,

06:02.067 --> 06:06.133
BUT, UH, YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK
ON THE SWAGGER.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.700
MRS. LARSON...

06:08.733 --> 06:10.067
CALL ME SOPHIE.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.467
NOW BE A DOLL
AND BRING ME A REMOTE.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.167
THIS ONE'S BUSTED.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.133
SOPHIE...

06:16.167 --> 06:17.100
HMM?

06:17.133 --> 06:19.067
I CAN'T BRING YOU
A NEW REMOTE

06:19.067 --> 06:21.767
BECAUSE YOU'RE NO LONGER
A PATIENT AT THIS HOSPITAL.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.067
NOW ACCORDING TO YOUR CHART,

06:23.067 --> 06:26.467
YOU HAVE A ROOM WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE SUGAR MAPLE NURSING HOME.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.233
I'M STAYING UNTIL
MY DAUGHTER'S HOUSE IS READY.

06:29.267 --> 06:30.767
SHE'S CONVERTING HER DEN

06:30.800 --> 06:32.767
INTO MY BEDROOM.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.800
SHE'S DOING IT
IN A SHADE OF PINK.

06:35.833 --> 06:39.467
NOW... BRING ME
A REMOTE, IRISH.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.600
I'M GOING TO SING

06:41.633 --> 06:43.833
UNTIL YOU GET BACK.

06:43.867 --> 06:47.267
* CAN'T GO ON

06:47.300 --> 06:50.500
* EVERYTHING I HAVE
IS GONE *

06:50.533 --> 06:53.333
* STORMY WEATHER
COMING RIGHT UP.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.167
(hiccups)
(Alex)
YUMI MIYAZAKI, UH, 22,

06:55.200 --> 06:57.100
PRESENTED THIS MORNING
WITH PERSISTENT HICCUPS.

06:57.133 --> 06:58.633
SHE WAS GIVEN
50 CHLORPROMAZINE,

06:58.667 --> 06:59.833
WHICH STOPPED THEM
FOR AWHILE,

06:59.867 --> 07:01.533
BUT THEN THE HICCUPS
RETURNED,

07:01.567 --> 07:03.567
SO SHE NEEDS
A SURGICAL CONSULT

07:03.600 --> 07:05.500
TO RULE OUT
ESOPHAGEAL PERFORATION.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.333
WHEN DID YOUR HICCUPS START?

07:07.367 --> 07:10.367
A FEW DAYS AGO.
SHE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.
ARE YOU HER BOYFRIEND?

07:10.400 --> 07:12.600
HER COACH.
OH, SHE'S AN ATHLETE.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.200
OH, YUMI'S
A COMPETITIVE EATER.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.133
EATING IS A SPORT?

07:16.167 --> 07:19.100
UH, MIYAZAKI.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

07:19.133 --> 07:20.800
SHE'S LIKE A ROCK STAR
IN JAPAN.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.067
AGAIN, EATING IS A SPORT?

07:22.067 --> 07:25.233
TELL HER I SAW HER ON TV.
TELL HER I'M AN ATHLETE, TOO.

07:25.267 --> 07:27.067
I'M A WRESTLER.

07:27.067 --> 07:30.067
(speaking Japanese)

07:32.700 --> 07:35.700
(speaking Japanese)

07:38.867 --> 07:42.133
SHE WONDERS HOW A WRESTLER
GOT SMART ENOUGH TO BE A DOCTOR.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.067
MOST WRESTLERS SHE KNOWS
ARE DUMB.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.600
(laughs) JUST TELL HER

07:45.633 --> 07:47.600
SHE HASN'T BEEN HANGING OUT
AT THE RIGHT GYMS.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.533
HOW ABOUT INSTEAD
YOU TELL HER THAT

07:49.567 --> 07:51.067
A PERSISTENT HICCUP COULD BE

07:51.100 --> 07:53.067
AN INDICATION OF SOMETHING
MUCH MORE SERIOUS.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.400
(inhales deeply)

07:54.433 --> 07:55.800
SCHEDULE AN ESOPHAGRAM.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.733
OH, SHE IS COMPETING
THIS AFTERNOON

07:57.767 --> 07:59.233
AT THE TASTE OF SEATTLE.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.167
CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE HER
A STRONGER DOSE OF THAT DRUG?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.400
IT SEEMED TO WORK.

08:02.433 --> 08:04.333
DID THE HICCUPS COME BACK?
YES.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.100
THEN IT DIDN'T WORK.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.067
OHH.

08:09.067 --> 08:10.733
DR. BAILEY?

08:10.767 --> 08:12.533
BE QUIET.

08:12.567 --> 08:15.733
(Izzie) DR. BAILEY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

08:15.767 --> 08:18.333
(sighs)

08:18.367 --> 08:23.400
ALL RIGHT, SOMEBODY PAGE
ADDISON SHEPHERD.

08:25.767 --> 08:27.667
(Addison) THERE HE IS.
HEARTBEAT'S STRONG.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.467
SINCE THERE'S NO DILATION
OR EFFACEMENT,

08:30.500 --> 08:33.667
LOOKS LIKE NOTHING MORE
THAN BRAXTON HICKS.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.733
EXCEPT?

08:35.767 --> 08:37.667
I KNOW
THE MILD-CONCERN TONE.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.567
I'VE USED MYSELF
FROM TIME TO TIME.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.333
SOMETIMES, FALSE LABOR
IS THE BODY'S WAY

08:43.367 --> 08:45.267
OF TELLING YOU TO SLOW DOWN.
I'M A SURGEON.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.200
I UNDERSTAND THE REALITIES
OF YOUR JOB,

08:47.233 --> 08:49.233
BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THE REALITIES OF YOUR PREGNANCY

08:49.267 --> 08:50.567
AND TAKE IT EASY.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.633
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP--

08:52.667 --> 08:54.333
WELL, YEAH, FOR STARTERS,

08:54.367 --> 08:56.300
YOU CAN HELP ME
GET UP OFF THIS TABLE.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.267
DR. BAILEY...

08:58.300 --> 09:00.200
THE G.I. LAB HAS
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

09:00.233 --> 09:01.700
ABOUT MS. MIYAZAKI'S
ESOPHAGRAM.

09:01.733 --> 09:04.133
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.367
(sighs)

09:05.400 --> 09:07.267
DR. STEVENS.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.400
KEEP AN EYE
ON HER TODAY.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.333
WATCH OUT FOR
ANY PAINFUL CONTRACTIONS,

09:12.367 --> 09:14.067
MORE THAN FIVE IN AN HOUR,

09:14.100 --> 09:17.167
ANYTHING THAT COULD INDICATE
PRETERM LABOR.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.700
THE FAVOR'S NOT FOR ME, STEVENS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.433
(Meredith) NAOMI CLINE, 43,

09:24.467 --> 09:26.367
HAD HER TRICUSPID VALVE
REPLACED THREE YEARS AGO

09:26.400 --> 09:28.100
WITH A PORCINE VALVE, SIR.

09:28.133 --> 09:30.433
WELL, NAOMI, I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU

09:30.467 --> 09:32.067
BACK AGAIN SO SOON.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.733
PIG VALVE USUALLY HOLDS UP
10 TO 15 YEARS,

09:34.767 --> 09:36.667
BUT YOURS
SEEMS TO BE DEGENERATING

09:36.700 --> 09:38.633
A LITTLE TOO QUICKLY
FOR MY COMFORT.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.200
OH, HEART VALVE,
SCHMEART VALVE.

09:40.233 --> 09:43.100
I GOT MARRIED,
DR. BURKE! (laughs)

09:43.133 --> 09:45.067
I FOUND HIM--

09:45.067 --> 09:48.433
MY TRUE LOVE, MY...
YOU JUMP, I JUMP.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.133
(laughs) LOOK...

09:50.167 --> 09:52.067
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

09:52.100 --> 09:52.933
AND LOOK--

09:52.967 --> 09:57.667
LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL MAN.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.700
(chuckles)

09:58.733 --> 10:01.500
WE, UH, MET
IN THE GROCERY STORE.

10:01.533 --> 10:02.600
OH, HONEY.

10:02.633 --> 10:03.433
CONGRATULATIONS.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.467
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
SO HAPPY, NAOMI.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.567
YEAH.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.233
UH, SO NAOMI'S
HEART VALVE...

10:10.267 --> 10:11.500
WH-WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

10:11.533 --> 10:14.333
OH, THERE'S AN UNDERLYING CAUSE
FOR YOUR WIFE'S VALVE FAILURE

10:14.367 --> 10:16.367
THAT REMAINS UNDIAGNOSED.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.033
THEORIES, GREY?

10:18.067 --> 10:19.767
RHEUMATIC FEVER,
CHRONIC USE OF MIGRAINE MEDS...

10:19.800 --> 10:22.100
(Doc barks)

10:22.133 --> 10:24.633
OR I.V. NARCOTICS

10:24.667 --> 10:27.233
COULD ALL CAUSE, UH,
VALVE DISEASE, SIR.

10:27.267 --> 10:29.167
OH, I DON'T USE DRUGS.
DON'T NEED 'EM.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.300
I'VE GOT TOM.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.367
HE'S MY DRUG.
(laughs)

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
AREN'T YOU, BABY?
YEAH.

10:35.433 --> 10:37.700
SHE'S HIGH, DR. BURKE.

10:37.733 --> 10:40.300
NO, SHE'S IN LOVE.
SHE'S HAPPY.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.767
NOBODY IS THAT HAPPY.
SHE'S ON DRUGS.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.133
RUN A TOX SCREEN,

10:44.167 --> 10:46.633
BUT NAOMI DOESN'T STRIKE ME
AS A LIAR.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.800
IF SHE SAYS NO DRUGS,
THEN THERE'S NO DRUGS.

10:48.833 --> 10:51.033
YOU DEVELOP A SIXTH SENSE
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.800
EVERYBODY'S A LIAR.

10:52.833 --> 10:54.333
(barks)

10:54.367 --> 10:55.667
DR. GREY, IS THAT A DOG?

10:55.700 --> 10:58.433
NO.

11:00.567 --> 11:02.467
KEEP THIS ELEVATED
FOR AWHILE, OKAY?
YEAH.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.500
I'M GONNA CHECK IN ON YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.300
HEY, YANG.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.233
YOU WERE A LITTLE HARSH
IN THERE.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.567
WELL, HE WAS LYING.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.500
BESIDES, YOUR HARSH
IS ANOTHER MAN'S REFRESHING.

11:13.533 --> 11:15.067
WELL, HE'S IN SHOCK.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.833
YOU KNOW, HE LOST HIS FINGERS

11:16.867 --> 11:18.767
AND HIS ONLY REMAINING HABIT
ALL IN ONE DAY.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.267
WE NEED TO BE COMPASSIONATE.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.333
COMPASSIONATE?

11:21.367 --> 11:23.433
YES, IT'S AN EMOTION.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF IT?

11:23.467 --> 11:25.100
WELL, HAVE YOU?

11:25.133 --> 11:27.133
SHE'S BARELY BACK ON HER FEET,

11:27.167 --> 11:29.067
AND YOU'VE GOT HER
CALLING YOU McDREAMY AGAIN.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.433
NOW I WAS JUST TELLING
THE PATIENT THE TRUTH,

11:31.467 --> 11:33.500
SO YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TRY IT SOMETIME.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.733
REMOTES...

11:44.100 --> 11:45.067
REMOTES.

11:45.067 --> 11:47.433
O'MALLEY.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.833
I'M--I'M GETTING A REMOTE
FOR MRS. LARSON.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.767
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE UPPER HAND?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.700
HAVE YOU MET
MRS. LARSON, SIR?

11:56.733 --> 11:59.267
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'S BEEN HERE THIS LONG,

11:59.300 --> 12:00.800
IN A PRIVATE ROOM?

12:00.833 --> 12:03.067
SHE HANDLED YOU, TOO?

12:04.700 --> 12:06.667
WELL, SHE SANG
FOR THE TROOPS, YOU KNOW?

12:06.700 --> 12:10.233
CAN'T WE JUST KEEP HER HERE
UNTIL HER ROOM

12:10.267 --> 12:12.167
AT HER DAUGHTER'S HOUSE
IS READY?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.367
NO, WE CAN'T.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.600
NOT ON SURGICAL SERVICE,
ANYWAY.

12:17.633 --> 12:20.167
OH. OKAY.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.200
BUT SOME OTHER SERVICE?

12:23.233 --> 12:24.567
I'M THE CHIEF, O'MALLEY.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.667
I CAN'T CONDONE TURFING PATIENTS
ONTO OTHER SERVICES.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.067
YOU HEAR ME, O'MALLEY?

12:34.267 --> 12:37.200
I'M, UH, I'M MISSING
MY PROGRAM, IRISH.

12:37.233 --> 12:40.333
AND I DON'T SEE A REMOTE
IN THAT HOT LITTLE HAND.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.067
I NOTICED YOUR URINE OUTPUT

12:42.067 --> 12:44.267
HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY
SINCE YESTERDAY.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.700
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE YOU
TO GYNECOLOGY

12:46.733 --> 12:49.133
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROLAPSED UTERUS.

12:49.167 --> 12:53.067
HONEY, MY UTERUS HASN'T
BEEN AN ISSUE FOR 30 YEARS.

12:53.067 --> 12:56.100
I KNOW, BUT IT MIGHT BE
AN ISSUE NOW.

12:56.133 --> 13:00.400
YOU KNOW, ONE THAT COULD
KEEP YOU HERE IN THE HOSPITAL

13:00.433 --> 13:02.267
FOR TESTS.

13:06.133 --> 13:09.267
YOU DRIVE.
I'LL RIDE SHOTGUN.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.200
YOU'RE NOT MOVING OUT,
GEORGE.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.533
OH, YES, I AM.

13:12.567 --> 13:15.433
I GAVE AN ULTIMATUM.
I THREW DOWN THE GAUNTLET.

13:15.467 --> 13:17.367
I DREW MY LINE
IN THE SAND.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.300
WELL, UN-GIVE,
UN-THROW, UN-DRAW.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.233
A MAN DOES NOT GIVE
AN ULTIMATUM

13:21.267 --> 13:22.633
AND THEN BACK DOWN.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.233
MEREDITH HAD A CHOICE,
AND SHE CHOSE THE DOG.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.533
A GIRL CHOSE A DOG
OVER YOU?

13:27.567 --> 13:29.100
YES.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.067
NO.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.700
ARE WE GONNA DO THIS
OR WHAT?

13:39.733 --> 13:41.433
YEAH, LET'S--
LET'S GO.

13:41.467 --> 13:42.800
DON'T START WITHOUT ME.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.700
WE'RE NOT GONNA START
IF IZZIE DOESN'T FOCUS.

13:44.733 --> 13:46.267
IZZIE, COME ON.
WHAT SHOULD I PUT
ON THE FLYER?

13:46.300 --> 13:48.200
I DON'T--
DESTRUCTIVE, AGGRESSIVE
HELL DOG AVAILABLE?

13:48.233 --> 13:50.633
THAT'S NOT HELPING.
FINE.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.067
UH, PLAYFUL, PROTECTIVE PUPPY.
NEED LOVING HOME.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.533
GOOD.
I KNOW.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.233
HEY, GEORGE.
DON'T TALK TO ME!
YOU'LL ONLY MAKE ME MAD.

13:57.267 --> 13:59.167
YOU'RE GONNA MESS UP MY GAME
AND I'M IN THE ZONE.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.633
OKAY.

14:00.667 --> 14:01.867
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:01.900 --> 14:04.500
OH, IT'S A FLYER.
I'M GONNA PUT IT UP--
IZZIE, COME ON.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.767
OKAY.
KEEP YOUR PANTIES ON.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.600
ALL RIGHT.

14:08.633 --> 14:10.300
NO TOUCHING!

14:10.333 --> 14:11.333
(pants)

14:11.367 --> 14:13.533
(laughs) GO!

14:13.567 --> 14:17.233
***

14:18.233 --> 14:20.433
YOU'RE ADVERTISING
FOR A HOME FOR DOC?

14:20.467 --> 14:23.367
I SAID I WOULD DO IT?
AND YOU HAVEN'T,
AND YOU WON'T.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.567
AND I DON'T WANT GEORGE
TO LEAVE.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.233
WELL, AT LEAST PUT THAT
HE'S NOT HOUSEBROKEN.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.433
(whines)

14:28.467 --> 14:30.133
***

14:30.167 --> 14:31.400
WHAT? IT'S THE TRUTH.

14:31.433 --> 14:34.400
OKAY, SO YOU WANT ME
TO PUT THE TRUTH. FINE.

14:34.433 --> 14:37.367
VICIOUS, HYPER DEVIL MUTT
IS AVAILABLE

14:37.400 --> 14:40.067
AND WILL PEE ON YOUR BED.

14:40.067 --> 14:42.067
HE'S YOUR DOG, TOO.
WE GOT HIM TOGETHER.

14:42.067 --> 14:44.067
WE GOT HIM TOGETHER,
BUT HE'S NOT MY DOG.

14:44.067 --> 14:47.200
HE'S NOT YOUR DOG, EITHER.
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW US.

14:47.233 --> 14:49.500
WE ARE NOT HOME ENOUGH
FOR HIM TO KNOW US.

14:49.533 --> 14:51.167
(muffled voice)
IT'S A RECORD.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.567
IT'S A RECORD!
(mumbles)

14:52.600 --> 14:54.433
(muffled voice)
SHE'S CHEATING.
I BEAT YOUR ASSES.

14:54.467 --> 14:57.533
(Alex, George and Cristina
arguing with muffled voices)

14:57.567 --> 14:59.567
* YOU WANNA BE ME,
BUT YOU CAN'T BE ME *

14:59.600 --> 15:02.500
* YOU WANNA BE ME,
BUT YOU... *

15:02.533 --> 15:04.433
CRAP, SHE'S GONNA BLOW.
(Meredith) RUN!

15:04.467 --> 15:06.633
AAH!

15:09.400 --> 15:10.567
"THE SURGICAL FLOOR

15:10.600 --> 15:12.067
"HAS BECOME A DUMPING GROUND

15:12.100 --> 15:13.833
"FOR PATIENTS
WHO AREN'T EVEN SURGICAL.

15:13.867 --> 15:15.400
"WE ARE OVERWORKED
AND EXHAUSTED.

15:15.433 --> 15:17.067
"THIS MAKES FOR--"
THE NURSES AGAIN?

15:17.100 --> 15:18.667
CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS?

15:18.700 --> 15:20.700
YOU USED TO BE ONE OF 'EM.
DON'T YOU SPEAK NURSE?

15:20.733 --> 15:22.633
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T GET
ANY RESPECT FROM THE NURSES--

15:22.667 --> 15:24.667
SURGICAL ARROGANCE.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.067
(scoffs)
I'M NOT ARROGANT.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.333
YOU'RE KILLING 'EM
WITH THAT WORKLOAD.

15:28.367 --> 15:29.700
LOOK AT THE BOARD.

15:29.733 --> 15:30.667
WHAT?

15:30.700 --> 15:32.200
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL BOARD.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.433
IT'S A CROWDED BOARD.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.700
WE NEED MORE NURSES.

15:41.067 --> 15:42.233
MR. KAMAJI,

15:42.267 --> 15:45.700
THIS IS PROBABLY
WHAT'S CAUSING HER HICCUPS.

15:45.733 --> 15:48.167
A TEAR IN THE LINING
OF HER ESOPHAGUS.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.633
CAN YOU FIX IT?

15:49.667 --> 15:52.233
YES, SURGICALLY,
AND THE SOONER THE BETTER.
AFTER THE COMPETITION TODAY,

15:52.267 --> 15:54.167
HER SCHEDULE IS CLEAR
UNTIL MARCH.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.100
NO, HER SCHEDULE
IS CLEAR NOW.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.333
SHE CAN'T COMPETE TODAY.

15:57.367 --> 16:00.067
AND IF SHE ENJOYS THE TASTE
OF SOLID FOOD,

16:00.100 --> 16:01.467
I RECOMMEND
GIVING UP THE SPORT

16:01.500 --> 16:03.400
FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE LESS AGGRESSIVE,

16:03.433 --> 16:05.667
SAY BOXING.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.233
I SEE.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.667
COULD YOU GIVE US
SOME PRIVACY, PLEASE?

16:19.233 --> 16:20.567
KAREV...

16:20.600 --> 16:22.133
GET THE TRANSLATOR
UP HERE.

16:22.167 --> 16:24.700
LET'S MAKE SURE SHE'S GETTIN'
THE WHOLE TRUTH.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.733
PUT THAT OUT.

16:30.767 --> 16:32.733
SORRY.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.667
I'VE GOTTA PREP YOU
FOR SURGERY.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.433
CAN YOU ASK YOUR FRIENDS
TO LEAVE?

16:36.467 --> 16:38.100
MWAH.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.633
I WASN'T GONNA LIGHT 'EM.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.133
I WAS JUST HOLDING 'EM.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.533
OKAY.

16:46.567 --> 16:48.800
SERIOUSLY, TAKE 'EM.
THROW 'EM OUT.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.167
NO, YOU HANG ON TO 'EM.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.700
SERIOUSLY, I WASN'T
GONNA SMOKE.

16:51.733 --> 16:53.833
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T CARE.
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

16:53.867 --> 16:57.567
YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO QUIT, DO YOU?

16:57.600 --> 17:01.067
NO, I DON'T.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.800
(Sophie)
* I'M LONELY ALL THE TIME

17:06.833 --> 17:08.267
OH, NO.

17:08.300 --> 17:11.500
OH, YEAH.

17:13.167 --> 17:14.500
IRISH.

17:14.533 --> 17:18.067
THAT NICE LADY DOCTOR
IN GYNECOLOGY

17:18.100 --> 17:21.500
SAID THAT SINCE I HAD
A HYSTERECTOMY BACK IN '74,

17:21.533 --> 17:25.567
I DON'T HAVE A UTERUS
TO PROLAPSE.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.367
DAMN IT.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.367
I'VE BEEN FEELING
A BIT FEVERISH.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.633
A WOMAN MY AGE
WITH A FEVER

17:31.667 --> 17:33.233
COULD BE
AN INDICATION OF,

17:33.267 --> 17:36.433
OH, ANY NUMBER
OF AWFUL DISEASES.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.367
THEY TOOK YOUR TEMPERATURE
AN HOUR AGO.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.700
IT WAS NORMAL.

17:40.733 --> 17:42.267
I AM SORRY, SOPHIE,

17:42.300 --> 17:44.667
BUT I AM GONNA
HAVE TO CALL YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.567
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M WARM.

17:55.667 --> 18:00.533
THAT MUST BE ONE HELL
OF A DOG.

18:00.567 --> 18:02.067
EXCUSE ME?

18:02.067 --> 18:04.433
WITH THOSE EYES...

18:04.467 --> 18:08.633
AND THOSE NICE,
FIRM HANDS...

18:08.667 --> 18:12.500
A GIRL CHOOSES A DOG
OVER YOU...

18:12.533 --> 18:17.533
IT MUST BE ONE HELL
OF A DOG.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.433
MRS. CLINE'S TOX SCREEN
AND TITER

18:21.467 --> 18:23.100
BOTH CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.067
I WAS SURE I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.800
GONNA HAVE TO ADJUST
YOUR WORLDVIEW, DR. GREY.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.733
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO DON'T LIE.

18:28.767 --> 18:29.700
MAYBE.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.600
ALTHOUGH, FRANKLY,

18:31.633 --> 18:34.500
THE DRUG USE WOULD'VE EXPLAINED
THE VALVE FAILURE.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.467
SO HOW DO WE PROCEED?

18:36.500 --> 18:38.400
LET'S SCHEDULE MRS. CLINE
FOR HER SURGERY.

18:38.433 --> 18:40.400
OKAY.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.467
DO YOU WANT TO COME OVER
FOR DINNER?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.100
WHAT?

18:46.133 --> 18:46.900
DINNER--

18:46.933 --> 18:49.167
OUR PLACE--
MINE AND CRISTINA'S.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.167
WHY?

18:51.533 --> 18:53.600
YOU'RE CRISTINA'S
BEST FRIEND.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.067
I WANT HER TO FEEL WELCOME TO
HAVE HER FRIENDS IN OUR HOME.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.567
OH, SO SHE MOVED IN
WITH YOU?

18:57.600 --> 18:58.833
YES.

18:58.867 --> 19:00.433
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU?

19:00.467 --> 19:03.833
OF COURSE SHE TOLD ME.
WHY WOULDN'T SHE TELL ME?

19:03.867 --> 19:06.233
SHE'S IN, RIGHT?

19:06.267 --> 19:09.200
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
I THINK IS GREAT.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.667
GREAT.

19:15.167 --> 19:17.133
THANK YOU.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.300
JUST CAME
FROM MR. FREEARK'S ROOM.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.233
HE'S CONVINCED HE WON'T
BE ABLE TO QUIT SMOKING.

19:23.267 --> 19:24.600
SAYS YOU AGREE.

19:24.633 --> 19:26.533
WELL, HE ASKED MY OPINION.
YOU WANT ME TO APOLOGIZE?

19:26.567 --> 19:28.467
NO, I WANT YOU TO GO IN THERE
AND TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE WRONG,

19:28.500 --> 19:29.833
THAT YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY,

19:29.867 --> 19:31.767
THAT YOUR FAVORITE UNCLE
DIED OF LUNG CANCER

19:31.800 --> 19:33.700
AND EVERY TIME YOU SEE
A CIGARETTE, YOU FREAK OUT.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.633
SAY WHATEVER YOU NEED TO SAY,
BUT GET HIM TO BELIEVE

19:35.667 --> 19:37.567
THAT THIS IS ABOUT YOU,
NOT HIM.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.733
BECAUSE IF HE THINKS HE WON'T
BE ABLE TO QUIT, HE WON'T.

19:39.767 --> 19:41.433
THEN WE SHOULDN'T EVEN
DO THE SURGERY.
FINE.

19:41.467 --> 19:42.867
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
I'M YOUR BOSS.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.067
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
SHUT UP. YOU'RE NOT
MY BOSS RIGHT NOW.

19:45.067 --> 19:46.500
WE'RE IN AN ELEVATOR.
THAT'S YOUR SPECIALTY, RIGHT,

19:46.533 --> 19:48.433
McDREAMY MOMENTS
IN ELEVATORS?
DR. YANG.

19:48.467 --> 19:51.067
FOR A MOMENT, I'M NOT DR. YANG
AND YOU'RE NOT DR. SHEPHERD.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.800
YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO SCREWED UP MY FRIEND,

19:52.833 --> 19:54.733
THE GUY WHO DROVE HER
TO GET A DOG SHE CAN'T KEEP

19:54.767 --> 19:57.067
A DOG SHE ONLY GOT
BECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND

19:57.100 --> 19:59.267
LIED TO HER ABOUT HIS WIFE.
I NEVER LIED TO HER.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.200
I KNOW A LIAR WHEN I SEE ONE
'CAUSE I'M A LIAR.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.133
FINE, YOU WANT ME
TO LIE TO THE PATIENT?

20:03.167 --> 20:04.433
FINE, I'LL LIE.

20:04.467 --> 20:06.767
YUMI.

20:07.767 --> 20:10.333
HEY, THE TRANSLATOR'S HERE.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.167
WHERE'S THE PATIENT--
MIYAZAKI?

20:12.200 --> 20:14.167
SHE LEFT WITH HER FRIEND
ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.367
SHE WASN'T DISCHARGED.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.067
SORRY, WE'RE SHORT STAFFED.

20:17.100 --> 20:20.033
I ASSUMED SOMEONE ELSE
HAD DONE THE PAPERWORK.

20:20.067 --> 20:21.600
DAMN IT.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.700
UNH! COME ON!

20:23.733 --> 20:25.533
DAMN IT.

20:25.567 --> 20:27.700
COME ON!
(kicks machine) OHH!

20:27.733 --> 20:29.633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT OF BED?

20:29.667 --> 20:31.567
I GOTTA GET
A CANDY BAR, MAN.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.233
YOU'RE ON MORPHINE,

20:33.267 --> 20:35.167
YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE SURGERY
AND YOU CAN'T EAT.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.400
MR. FREEARK, PLEASE.
MY DAD'S MR. FREEARK.

20:36.433 --> 20:37.367
CAREFUL.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.033
HE'S GOT A COMBOVER

20:39.067 --> 20:40.800
AND AN--AN ANNOYING WIFE
NAMED KIMBERLY, SO--

20:40.833 --> 20:43.667
RICK, LISTEN,
EARLIER, I WAS OUT OF LINE.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.067
NO, IT--

20:45.100 --> 20:47.267
YOU GOT ME TO THINK.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.600
I DON'T WANT TO BE A GUY
SITTIN' IN A BAR

20:49.633 --> 20:51.433
WITH A STUMP FOR A HAND,

20:51.467 --> 20:53.567
HAVING A SMOKE TEN YEARS
DOWN THE LINE,

20:53.600 --> 20:55.500
BRAGGING ABOUT HOW I USED
TO PLAY BETTER

20:55.533 --> 20:57.200
THAN DAVE NAVARRO.

20:57.233 --> 20:59.600
YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
CREEPY, BITTER GUY.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.067
HERE'S THE THING...

21:02.100 --> 21:04.500
MY LAST CIGARETTE
WAS THIS MORNING.

21:04.533 --> 21:09.067
ONLY I-I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS MY LAST CIGARETTE.

21:20.567 --> 21:23.567
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

21:27.167 --> 21:28.367
(Cristina)
McDREAMY'S BEING McDOUCHEY.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.667
HE'S MAKING ME STAND
AT THE BACK OF THE O.R.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.200
WHILE HE REATTACHES
RICK'S FINGERS.

21:32.233 --> 21:34.200
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN
TOUCH A RETRACTOR.

21:34.233 --> 21:35.733
I HATE HIM.

21:35.767 --> 21:38.600
TRUTH--DID YOU MOVE IN
WITH BURKE OR NOT?

21:38.633 --> 21:39.633
(sighs)

21:39.667 --> 21:41.567
I TOLD HIM
I MOVED IN WITH HIM,

21:41.600 --> 21:43.500
AND I'M KEEPING
MY OLD APARTMENT.

21:43.533 --> 21:45.067
WHAT?

21:45.100 --> 21:47.400
I SLEEP AT BURKE'S EVERY NIGHT,
MY CLOTHES ARE THERE.

21:47.433 --> 21:49.333
SO I STILL HAVE MY APARTMENT.
BIG DEAL.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.267
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.733
ACTUALLY, I DON'T.

21:52.767 --> 21:55.233
SO...

21:55.267 --> 21:59.467
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO TO DINNER
AT YOUR FAKE APARTMENT

21:59.500 --> 22:01.400
WITH THE GUY YOU FAKE
LIVE WITH?

22:01.433 --> 22:03.333
OH, I WOULD NEVER HAVE YOU
OVER TO DINNER WITH BURKE.

22:03.367 --> 22:04.833
THAT'S WEIRD.

22:04.867 --> 22:06.233
THIS IS MY POINT.

22:06.267 --> 22:07.667
STOP WITH THE LYING.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.367
AND YOU'RE BEING HONEST?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.100
THE LAST TIME
YOU CALLED HIM McDREAMY,

22:11.133 --> 22:13.067
YOU WERE ALL ATWITTER
WITH LOVE.

22:13.067 --> 22:14.400
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.200
UH-HUH.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.300
WE ARE.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.767
WEST NILE VIRUS,
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

22:20.800 --> 22:23.067
NO, LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S FEVERISH.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.200
SHE'S MUCH WEAKER
THAN SHE WAS THIS MORNING.

22:24.233 --> 22:26.267
SHE COULD BE DECOMPENSATING.
(coughs)

22:26.300 --> 22:28.733
SHE'S BEEN HERE
FOR A MONTH, DR. O'MALLEY.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.800
HAVE YOU SEE ANY MOSQUITOES
IN THIS HOSPITAL LATELY?

22:30.833 --> 22:34.300
OH, SUCH
A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN.

22:34.333 --> 22:38.567
THOSE CHOCOLATY EYES.

22:39.767 --> 22:41.667
IN ORDER TO TEST YOU,
MRS. LARSON,

22:41.700 --> 22:43.833
WE HAVE TO DO A SPINAL TAP.

22:43.867 --> 22:46.467
WILL YOU BE DOING IT?

22:48.733 --> 22:50.100
YES, MA'AM.

22:50.133 --> 22:52.733
WELL, THEN...
(chuckles)

22:52.767 --> 22:55.767
CALL ME SOPHIE.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.433
YOU GOT IT.

22:57.467 --> 23:00.700
NICE MEETING YOU, IRISH.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.067
SO, IF YOU'LL JUST SIGN HERE,

23:06.100 --> 23:08.367
WE CAN GO AHEAD
AND SCHEDULE YOU FOR SURGERY.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.467
OKAY. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE
A GORGEOUS YOUNG WOMAN.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.733
LOOK AT YOU.

23:15.633 --> 23:18.067
YOU SHOULD SMILE MORE.

23:23.567 --> 23:25.500
MR. CLINE.

23:25.533 --> 23:28.433
OH, UH...

23:28.467 --> 23:29.633
DO ME A FAVOR.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.400
SURE.

23:31.433 --> 23:33.333
DON'T TELL HER
YOU SAW ME.

23:33.367 --> 23:36.700
I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M
GOING TO GO IN.

23:36.733 --> 23:38.767
SHE'S...

23:38.800 --> 23:40.700
SHE CAN BE EXHAUSTING.

23:40.733 --> 23:43.433
YEAH, SHE'S...
REALLY HAPPY.

23:43.467 --> 23:45.733
Y-YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST,

23:45.767 --> 23:47.600
YOU KNOW, FALLING IN LOVE,
THE WEDDING.

23:47.633 --> 23:49.267
BUT I WAS KINDA HOPING

23:49.300 --> 23:51.733
THE HONEYMOON WOULD BE OVER
BY NOW, YOU KNOW?

23:51.767 --> 23:54.333
I MEAN, IT'S NOT NORMAL,

23:54.367 --> 23:56.567
RIGHT?

23:56.600 --> 23:59.400
(whispers)
NOBODY'S THAT HAPPY.

23:59.433 --> 24:01.833
RUN A TOX SCREEN
ON NAOMI CLINE.

24:01.867 --> 24:04.400
OH WHOSE ORDERS?
DR. BURKE'S, OF COURSE.

24:15.367 --> 24:17.233
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

24:17.267 --> 24:19.167
THE PARAMEDICS
ARE ON THEIR WAY IN

24:19.200 --> 24:20.067
WITH YUMI MIYAZAKI.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.600
SHE COLLAPSED
AT THE TASTE OF SEATTLE

24:21.633 --> 24:22.833
AND IS VOMITING BLOOD.

24:22.867 --> 24:24.500
DAMN FOOL.

24:24.533 --> 24:26.433
PROBABLY TORE HER ESOPHAGUS
IN TWO BY NOW.

24:26.467 --> 24:27.667
ALL RIGHT.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.700
MM.

24:28.733 --> 24:30.400
ARE YOU OKAY?

24:30.433 --> 24:32.167
(sighs)

24:35.400 --> 24:37.300
COMPLICATIONS
OF BOERHAAVE'S SYNDROME.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.100
GO.

24:38.133 --> 24:41.700
PLEURAL EFFUSION,
SEPSIS, SHOCK.

24:41.733 --> 24:43.633
SHE'S CYANOTIC
WITH SHALLOW BREATH SOUNDS.

24:43.667 --> 24:44.833
B.P. 76 OVER 42.

24:44.867 --> 24:46.600
TACHYCARDIC TO THE 130s.

24:46.633 --> 24:49.367
STARTED HER ON HIGH-FLOW 02
AND HER SECOND BOLUS OF SALINE.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.733
(Miranda) ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET HER TO THE O.R.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.567
(Izzie) THEY'RE READY
AND WAITING.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.300
HER FREAKIN' COACH SHOULD BE
THE ONE ON THIS GURNEY.

24:58.333 --> 25:01.133
LET'S KEEP OUR EYES
ON THE PRIZE, KAREV,

25:01.167 --> 25:02.367
SAVING THIS WOMAN'S LIFE.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.300
I'LL MEET YOU GUYS
UP THERE.

25:04.333 --> 25:07.667
ME, TOO. HEY, HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, PUNCH HIM OUT?

25:07.700 --> 25:09.400
YEAH.
SO YOU'RE GONNA
KICK HIS ASS,

25:09.433 --> 25:11.333
GET YOURSELF KICKED OUT
OF THE PROGRAM

25:11.367 --> 25:13.467
BEFORE YOU HAVE TO OPEN
YOUR BOARD SCORES

25:13.500 --> 25:15.400
JUST IN CASE YOU FAILED.
(pager beeps)

25:15.433 --> 25:17.267
GOD, YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

25:17.300 --> 25:20.767
DR. KAREV, HOW DO I BEGIN
THE ESOPHAGOMYOTOMY?

25:20.800 --> 25:22.700
CUT PROXIMAL AND DISTAL
TO THE TEAR

25:22.733 --> 25:24.267
TO EXPOSE
THE MUCOSAL DEFECT.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.133
CORRECT.

25:26.167 --> 25:29.133
THEN WE'LL MOVE TO
DEBRIDEMENT OF THE DEFECT--

25:29.167 --> 25:30.700
(gasps)

25:30.733 --> 25:32.667
OHH!

25:32.700 --> 25:36.167
DR. BAILEY,
THOSE AREN'T BRAXTON HICKS
CONTRACTION.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.733
I BELIEVE

25:39.767 --> 25:42.433
YOU'RE IN PRETERM LABOR.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.833
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME SOONER?

25:48.867 --> 25:51.467
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.633
I WAS GONNA FASHION
A GASTRIC PATCH.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.433
I TAUGHT YOU
THE PROCEDURE.

25:54.467 --> 25:56.067
NOW LEAVE.

25:56.067 --> 25:58.433
(sighs)

25:58.467 --> 26:03.533
HERE. GET THAT CLAMP.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.767
I GOT PAGED, DR. GREY.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.100
JEFFREY WANTED TO GIVE ME
THE RESULTS

26:13.133 --> 26:16.267
OF THE EXTENSIVE BLOOD WORK
THAT I ORDERED.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.567
YOU FORGED MY SIGNATURE?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.700
THAT'S REALLY BAD, RIGHT?

26:19.733 --> 26:22.267
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY BAD.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.233
NAOMI IS NOT ON DRUGS.

26:24.267 --> 26:26.267
THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.800
THEY DID?

26:27.833 --> 26:29.767
THEY DID, AGAIN.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.800
NEXT TIME YOU FORGE
MY SIGNATURE, LET ME KNOW.

26:31.833 --> 26:34.067
SAVE ME A TRIP.

26:37.133 --> 26:38.567
THAT'S IT?

26:38.600 --> 26:40.267
YOU'RE NOT GONNA YELL

26:40.300 --> 26:42.200
AND SAY, "DAMN IT, GREY,"
AND STORM OUT?

26:42.233 --> 26:44.133
I WILL IF YOU WANT ME TO.
NO.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.400
DR. BURKE,
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

26:45.433 --> 26:47.300
HER SEROTONIN LEVEL,
IT'S THROUGH THE ROOF.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.767
DR. GREY, YOU TOOK
A DETAILED HISTORY.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.133
MM-HMM.

26:52.167 --> 26:54.333
WHEN DID MRS. CLINE
DEVELOP ASTHMA?

26:54.367 --> 26:56.667
AFTER THE FIRST SURGERY.
WHY?

26:56.700 --> 26:59.200
WE FOUND A CARCINOID TUMOR
IN THE LUNG.

26:59.233 --> 27:00.700
VERY RARE,

27:00.733 --> 27:02.400
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO DIAGNOSE.

27:02.433 --> 27:06.367
IT MASKS ITSELF AS A BUNCH OF
SEEMINGLY UNRELATED SYMPTOMS--

27:06.400 --> 27:08.433
ADULT-ONSET ASTHMA,
VALVE FAILURE...

27:08.467 --> 27:11.067
AN INCREASED LEVEL
OF SEROTONIN IN THE BLOOD...

27:11.067 --> 27:12.700
WHICH CREATES A FALSE SENSE
OF EUPHORIA.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.433
SO NAOMI'S NOT ACTUALLY
THIS HAPPY?

27:16.467 --> 27:18.067
SHE JUST HAS A TUMOR?

27:18.100 --> 27:19.333
(Preston) EXACTLY.

27:19.367 --> 27:21.767
THANK GOD.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.133
YOU PEOPLE WITH YOUR TUMORS.

27:23.167 --> 27:25.067
I TELL YOU,
I'M INFECTED WITH LOVE.

27:25.100 --> 27:26.067
(laughs)

27:26.067 --> 27:28.700
I'M SORRY.
YOUR BODY IS LYING TO YOUR MIND.

27:28.733 --> 27:30.833
OH, LET THE LIE CONTINUE.
RIGHT, BABY?

27:30.867 --> 27:32.400
UH...

27:32.433 --> 27:34.333
HOW SOON CAN YOU CURE HER?

27:34.367 --> 27:36.267
TOMORROW WE CAN TAKE
THE TUMOR OUT.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.433
IF ALL GOES WELL,
NAOMI GOES BACK TO NORMAL.

27:39.467 --> 27:41.567
GREAT. THANK YOU, BOTH.

27:45.067 --> 27:46.800
THANK YOU
FOR NOT CHEWING ME OUT

27:46.833 --> 27:49.600
FOR FORGING YOUR SIGNATURE.

27:49.633 --> 27:51.567
THANK YOU.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.467
I KNOW IT WAS PROBABLY YOU
WHO CONVINCED CRISTINA.

27:54.500 --> 27:58.467
SHE'S VERY STRONG,
BUT SHE LISTENS TO YOU.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.400
IF YOU TOLD HER TO MOVE IN...

28:04.533 --> 28:07.967
ANYWAY... THANK YOU.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.733
NO PROBLEM.

28:18.067 --> 28:22.300
NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSATION
IN YOUR LEFT ARM AT ALL?

28:22.333 --> 28:25.067
NO.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.500
ACTUALLY, COULD I WATCH?

28:27.533 --> 28:31.067
(Derek) YEAH.
IT'S OKAY.

28:31.067 --> 28:33.200
I WANT TO SEE
EVERY BLOOD VESSEL AND NERVE

28:33.233 --> 28:36.100
I'M GONNA SCREW UP
IF I EVER SMOKE AGAIN.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.133
NOT THAT I'M GONNA...

28:38.167 --> 28:41.067
EVER AGAIN.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.600
I SMOKED MY LAST CIGARETTE.

28:45.733 --> 28:48.600
OKAY. LET'S GET STARTED.

28:48.633 --> 28:50.533
THE NURSING HOME
SAYS SHE NEVER SHOWED UP.

28:50.567 --> 28:52.467
HOW EXACTLY
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

28:52.500 --> 28:54.767
SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.733
MY MOTHER IS OLD AND INFIRM.
YOU COULDN'T MAKE HER LEAVE?

28:57.767 --> 28:59.767
HAVE YOU MET YOUR MOTHER?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.467
FINE.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.133
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

29:03.167 --> 29:04.500
OH, HI. I'M DR. O'MALLEY.

29:04.533 --> 29:06.633
SHE'S IN
THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE SERVICE.

29:06.667 --> 29:08.500
INFECTIOUS DISEASE?

29:08.533 --> 29:10.367
SINCE WHEN DOES SHE HAVE
AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.333
SHE DOESN'T. SHE JUST
DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE.

29:12.367 --> 29:13.800
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.767
YEAH, SHE IS.
SO IS HER ROOM READY?

29:15.800 --> 29:17.700
'CAUSE I CAN GO GET HER
RIGHT NOW.

29:17.733 --> 29:19.400
THEY HAVE HAD
THE ROOM READY FOR WEEKS.

29:19.433 --> 29:21.333
NO, UH, NOT AT, UH,
SUGAR MAPLE.

29:21.367 --> 29:22.833
I MEANT AT YOUR HOUSE.

29:22.867 --> 29:24.067
I'M SORRY?

29:24.100 --> 29:25.667
THE--THE PINK ROOM...

29:25.700 --> 29:27.667
AT YOUR HOUSE.

29:29.633 --> 29:31.400
(man) WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

29:31.433 --> 29:33.467
(siren wails)

29:33.500 --> 29:35.300
HI, SOPHIE.
IRISH.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.500
WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

29:37.533 --> 29:40.133
YOU WON'T CATCH
MY DISEASE, WILL YOU?

29:40.167 --> 29:42.700
NO, I THINK I'LL BE OKAY.

29:42.733 --> 29:43.833
(chuckles)

29:43.867 --> 29:48.133
SOPHIE, UH, YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS JUST HERE.

29:51.600 --> 29:56.400
UH... NURSING HOMES...

29:56.433 --> 30:00.633
ARE FOR OLD PEOPLE.

30:00.667 --> 30:05.200
I KNOW I'M ELDERLY.

30:05.233 --> 30:08.800
I DO KNOW THAT.

30:08.833 --> 30:13.000
BUT IF I HAVE TO GO
TO THAT PLACE...

30:15.167 --> 30:19.667
I'M AFRAID...
I'LL BECOME OLD.

30:19.700 --> 30:23.067
***

30:23.100 --> 30:26.233
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

30:26.267 --> 30:29.767
OH.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.167
YOU KNOW THAT I--

30:31.200 --> 30:34.200
I WOULD KEEP YOU HERE
IF I COULD?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.700
OH, NO, DARLING.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.700
YOU CAN'T WASTE
ANY MORE TIME WITH ME.

30:37.733 --> 30:41.567
YOU HAVE TO GO
BALL'S OUT WITH THE DOG.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.800
EXCUSE ME?

30:42.833 --> 30:45.400
SO SHE CHOSE AN ANIMAL
OVER YOU.

30:45.433 --> 30:47.233
SO WHAT?

30:47.267 --> 30:48.800
OH, WOMEN ARE FOOLS.

30:48.833 --> 30:51.167
THAT'S OLD NEWS.

30:51.200 --> 30:57.433
BUT LIFE'S TOO SHORT
FOR YOU TO GIVE IN, IRISH.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.200
SO FIGHT.

31:01.233 --> 31:05.067
YOU FIGHT FOR WHAT'S YOURS.

31:05.067 --> 31:08.067
***

31:18.100 --> 31:20.800
NOW THAT, MY FRIEND...

31:20.833 --> 31:22.733
IS A SWAGGER.

31:22.767 --> 31:26.600
***

31:27.800 --> 31:29.700
I'LL BE CLOSING
THE PERITONEAL CAVITY

31:29.733 --> 31:32.400
WITH ZERO CHROMIC SUTURES.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.300
THANK YOU.

31:34.333 --> 31:35.400
CHIEF?

31:35.433 --> 31:38.167
***

31:38.200 --> 31:39.567
LET'S GET BACK TO IT.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.367
PULL BACK ON THAT RETRACTOR.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.300
GIVE ME MORE SUCTION.

31:44.333 --> 31:48.233
I'LL NEED A SPONGE ON A STICK.

31:48.267 --> 31:49.767
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:49.800 --> 31:52.200
I TRIED,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

31:52.233 --> 31:53.700
IT IS NOW 6:07.

31:53.733 --> 31:55.767
THE SECOND SHIFT NURSES
START AT 6:00.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.433
THEY'RE NOT COMING IN.

31:57.467 --> 31:58.633
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

31:58.667 --> 32:01.333
WHAT A SICK-OUT WOULD DO
TO THIS HOSPITAL?

32:01.367 --> 32:03.133
I'VE ALREADY PUT IN
THE CALL FOR TEMPS.

32:03.167 --> 32:04.633
WHAT'S THIS?

32:04.667 --> 32:07.433
OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION.
WE GO ON STRIKE IN TEN DAYS.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.533
***

32:12.500 --> 32:14.500

32:15.500 --> 32:19.167

YOU'RE DOIN' JUST FINE.

32:19.200 --> 32:23.167
(speaking Japanese)

32:23.200 --> 32:25.100
WE SHOULD GET THE TRANSLATOR
BACK UP HERE.

32:25.133 --> 32:27.067
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.

32:27.067 --> 32:28.300
WE'LL BE BACK.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.700
***

32:30.733 --> 32:33.633
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:35.433 --> 32:37.567
I NEVER WOULD HAVE...

32:38.867 --> 32:42.200
I THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE FINE.
I'M SORRY.

32:42.233 --> 32:43.400
DON'T TELL ME,
TELL HER.

32:43.433 --> 32:46.067
TELL HER HOW HER CAREER
IS OVER BECAUSE OF YOU.

32:46.067 --> 32:49.433
***

33:10.467 --> 33:13.500
WAY BETTER
THAN PUNCHING HIM OUT.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.400
HEY, UH...

33:15.433 --> 33:18.300
CAN YOU...

33:18.333 --> 33:20.233
YOU WANT ME TO OPEN IT?

33:20.267 --> 33:23.133
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S...
I CAN'T, SO...

33:23.167 --> 33:25.400
I-I SHOULDN'T.
I MEAN, I--

33:25.433 --> 33:27.333
LOOK, YOU ALREADY THINK
I'M IDIOT.

33:27.367 --> 33:29.367
IT WON'T BE
ANY GREAT SHOCK.

33:37.367 --> 33:40.367
***

33:44.800 --> 33:46.500
CONGRATULATIONS.

33:46.533 --> 33:48.333
YOU ARE NOT AN IDIOT.

33:48.367 --> 33:50.800
EXCEPT WHEN YOU'RE...
BEING AN IDIOT.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.200
***

33:58.200 --> 33:59.367
GOOD.

HEY, HOW'S HE DOING?

34:05.233 --> 34:07.200
UH, JONESING
FOR A CIGARETTE,

34:07.233 --> 34:10.100
BUT I THINK HE'LL MAKE IT
TO THE END OF THE DAY.

34:10.133 --> 34:13.467
GOOD.
I WAS BEING NICE TO HER.
OKAY.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.567
I CAN BE NICE WITHOUT BEING,
YOU KNOW...

34:16.600 --> 34:19.500
McDREAMY. I KNOW.

34:19.533 --> 34:21.133
I REALLY CAN.

34:21.167 --> 34:23.400
OKAY.

34:23.433 --> 34:25.467
OKAY, THEN.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.133
***

34:28.167 --> 34:30.067
BED REST AT HOME
UNTIL THE BABY COMES.

34:30.100 --> 34:32.367
YOU DO KNOW WHAT BED REST IS,
DON'T YOU, MIRANDA?

34:32.400 --> 34:33.733
YEAH, HELL.

34:33.767 --> 34:34.833
HELL WITH TV AND BOOKS.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.733
HERE, IT'S FROM ALL OF US.

34:43.767 --> 34:46.667
I MAY BE 47 MONTHS PREGNANT,

34:46.700 --> 34:48.600
I MAY BE ON BED REST,

34:48.633 --> 34:51.133
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SEE MY OWN FEET,

34:51.167 --> 34:53.400
BUT I AM DR. BAILEY.

34:53.433 --> 34:54.767
I HEAR EVERYTHING,

I'M WATCHING EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

35:00.100 --> 35:02.200

35:09.700 --> 35:12.133
STRIKE?

35:12.167 --> 35:15.167
STRIKE.

35:15.200 --> 35:19.267
YOU ARE ALL A BUNCH
OF ARROGANT SURGEONS.

HEY.
THAT WAS IZZIE.

SHE REFUSES
TO TAKE THE DOG HOME.

MM-HMM.

35:37.233 --> 35:40.400
FINE, IF YOU WANT ME TO TELL
BURKE I DIDN'T MOVE IN,

35:40.433 --> 35:42.400
I'LL TELL HIM.

35:42.433 --> 35:44.133
NO. DON'T.

35:44.167 --> 35:45.100

35:46.667 --> 35:48.133
AT LEAST, NOT RIGHT NOW.

I JUST MEAN WAIT.

35:52.667 --> 35:55.100
IT CAN WAIT.

I LIED ABOUT DEREK.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.300
WE'RE NOT JUST FRIENDS.
