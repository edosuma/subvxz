00:35.850 --> 00:38.683
Okay, I was gonna do this
after you got home from school...

00:38.787 --> 00:40.550
but I'm too excited.

00:40.989 --> 00:42.547
The turkey knife!

00:42.791 --> 00:47.319
That's right. I've been waiting
for the right year and if you feel ready...

00:47.429 --> 00:51.832
this Thanksgiving you will be carving
one of the three tom turkeys.

00:51.933 --> 00:53.423
I'm ready, Dad.

00:53.668 --> 00:57.160
I wasn't ready last year. I realize that now.

00:57.272 --> 01:01.834
Okay. Pretend it's Thanksgiving
and this bread is a turkey.

01:07.115 --> 01:09.140
Oh, my God, it's so juicy.

01:10.085 --> 01:12.451
You see, Bobby, on Thanksgiving...

01:12.554 --> 01:16.285
people will be so jazzed
by the moistness of the turkey...

01:16.391 --> 01:19.360
you'll have to tune them out.
Now, try again.

01:22.831 --> 01:25.129
The kids' table needs dark meat!

01:30.739 --> 01:33.799
Dale, I read that the government
returned 84,000 acres...

01:33.908 --> 01:36.138
to the Utes near the Orahee Reservation.

01:36.244 --> 01:39.213
It's a good precedent
for our tribe's lawsuit, don't you think?

01:39.314 --> 01:42.613
Well, with me acting
as your legal adviser...

01:42.717 --> 01:45.550
I am confident you have an airtight case.

01:45.653 --> 01:48.986
Although I am not sure what you mean
by "precedent."

01:51.226 --> 01:52.887
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.

01:52.994 --> 01:54.461
Joseph, hello.

01:56.798 --> 01:57.765
Hey.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.858
So...

02:00.435 --> 02:02.300
is that a new backpack?

02:02.470 --> 02:03.698
Looks good on you.

02:03.805 --> 02:06.467
You know,
I'm speaking to your class today.

02:06.574 --> 02:09.508
We'll be going over
the Native American role in Thanksgiving.

02:09.610 --> 02:12.341
Why don't I give you a ride to school?

02:12.447 --> 02:14.278
No. I'll ride my bike.

02:15.416 --> 02:17.907
Dad, my bike chain is busted.

02:18.019 --> 02:19.577
No problem, son.

02:19.687 --> 02:23.020
I'm pretty sure I keep a chain tool
in Hank's garage.

02:26.795 --> 02:28.626
Morning, John Redcorn.

02:28.763 --> 02:30.993
Nancy, you just missed Joseph.

02:31.633 --> 02:34.124
Well, I guess you see him every day.

02:35.703 --> 02:37.637
He's just grown so much.

02:37.772 --> 02:40.172
Too much time goes by
without me seeing him.

02:40.275 --> 02:43.244
- Thank God for the holidays.
- Yeah, about that...

02:43.578 --> 02:47.776
I just don't think it's a good idea
your coming by this Thanksgiving.

02:47.882 --> 02:49.645
But I barely see my son since we broke up.

02:49.751 --> 02:52.185
Sug, he's Dale's son, remember?

02:52.487 --> 02:53.920
Say that now.

02:54.022 --> 02:58.652
But when it comes time to get him
into college, let's see what box you check.

03:01.830 --> 03:04.924
My people once owned
what is now central and southern Texas.

03:05.033 --> 03:07.900
Our land was taken from us
by the white man.

03:11.873 --> 03:13.864
BOBBY: Mr. Redcorn?
REDCORN: Yes?

03:13.975 --> 03:17.376
Are you sure it's the white man
who did all that stuff?

03:17.478 --> 03:21.881
Because I come from white people
and this is the first I'm hearing of it.

03:22.116 --> 03:23.947
Yes, I am sure.

03:24.052 --> 03:25.110
Wow.

03:25.353 --> 03:26.945
Yes, wow.

03:27.155 --> 03:28.645
[School bell ringing]

03:30.792 --> 03:33.784
You know, Bobby,
if you are interested in learning more...

03:33.895 --> 03:36.728
I could give you and Joseph a ride home.

03:36.831 --> 03:41.530
Ride? Really?
I've been dreading the walk home all day.

03:41.636 --> 03:44.662
These legs get dog-tired by 3:10.

03:48.376 --> 03:51.038
Luanne, are you ready for another
Thanksgiving Boggle tournament?

03:51.145 --> 03:54.046
Aunt Peggy, everybody hates
your Boggle tournament.

03:54.148 --> 03:55.513
- What?
- What?

03:55.850 --> 03:59.217
You just said that everybody hates
my Boggle tournament?

03:59.320 --> 04:01.618
I didn't say that, I thought it.

04:03.691 --> 04:08.185
Well, now that you know, everybody does
hate your Boggle tournament.

04:08.429 --> 04:11.626
But it's because you give grades
instead of prizes.

04:11.733 --> 04:14.065
Yes, Boggle is a harsh mistress.

04:14.235 --> 04:18.433
Maybe I should come up with a game
that other people have a chance at.

04:18.539 --> 04:21.666
It's gonna be tough to find one
that doesn't give me an advantage.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.741
[Upbeat music playing on jeep radio]

04:28.950 --> 04:31.350
Okay, Johnny. Stay cool.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.147
Don't bore him.

04:36.958 --> 04:38.084
Where's Joseph going?

04:38.192 --> 04:41.184
Who knows? That kid's a freaking mystery.

04:41.296 --> 04:43.355
I waited two-and-a-half hours.

04:43.498 --> 04:46.058
And I really appreciate that.

04:46.167 --> 04:50.160
Especially after all you say
the white man did to the Indians.

04:50.271 --> 04:52.466
You don't know the half of it.

04:53.274 --> 04:55.401
The white man is still doing it.

04:55.510 --> 05:00.004
Hundreds of years of the systematic rape
of my people is not enough, is it?

05:00.214 --> 05:02.774
I'm sorry. I just have to ask again.

05:03.251 --> 05:05.116
This is the white man?

05:06.087 --> 05:08.988
I've researched all the very best games
in the world.

05:09.157 --> 05:12.558
And what I learned was
people like to spin.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.560
And people like to choose.

05:14.662 --> 05:18.029
The trick was getting rid
of all the boring stuff in between.

05:18.132 --> 05:20.965
Spinning and choosing. I like those.

05:21.069 --> 05:23.594
Wait. What do I get to choose?

05:23.771 --> 05:26.069
Well, some game shows
have you choose a letter.

05:26.174 --> 05:27.232
Who cares?

05:27.342 --> 05:29.367
Some shows have you choose a category.

05:29.477 --> 05:31.342
My God, wake me up when it's over.

05:31.446 --> 05:35.439
In my game, you take that choice
and you spin it.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.608
The name of the game is...

05:38.119 --> 05:39.780
Spin the Choice.

05:40.054 --> 05:43.046
Luanne, do you want to spin the choice?

05:49.263 --> 05:51.026
See you, Mr. Redcorn.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.128
Bobby, in honor of your first carving...

05:55.269 --> 05:57.829
we're gonna fry up
one of the turkeys this year.

05:57.939 --> 06:02.035
Dad, that is no way to celebrate
the rape of the Native Americans...

06:02.176 --> 06:04.474
for 350 years.

06:04.579 --> 06:07.844
Bobby, don't use the word "rape,"
it's not polite.

06:07.949 --> 06:11.680
I don't know how else to describe
this idiotic ritual.

06:11.786 --> 06:12.912
Dad...

06:13.054 --> 06:16.785
you and your white people
stole hundreds of thousands of acres...

06:16.891 --> 06:21.157
from John Redcorn.
And now you celebrate by frying a turkey?

06:21.362 --> 06:23.455
When does the killing end?

06:25.233 --> 06:27.394
- What the...
- Hank, you're terrible.

06:27.502 --> 06:30.562
- I am not...
- Just give him his land back, Hank.

06:36.811 --> 06:40.713
You can't just barge in here!
This room is my property and...

06:42.450 --> 06:45.283
What's the use? Look who I'm talking to.

06:45.386 --> 06:47.354
You are talking to your father.

06:47.488 --> 06:51.083
And you will not use
that Frenchman's wave with me.

06:53.961 --> 06:56.862
Wait. This is about the turkey carving,
isn't it?

06:56.964 --> 06:59.489
It's all right
to have some pre-carving jitters.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.261
The good ones always do.

07:01.402 --> 07:04.371
Yes. What could be
more important than turkey?

07:04.472 --> 07:06.201
This makes me sick!

07:06.607 --> 07:10.099
"Thankstaking" isn't a time
for celebration.

07:11.079 --> 07:13.639
I refuse to carve your turkey.

07:13.748 --> 07:16.546
It is basted in the blood of the innocents.

07:16.651 --> 07:18.243
I'm out!

07:26.994 --> 07:29.622
This was gonna be
the perfect Thanksgiving.

07:29.730 --> 07:32.062
Bobby carving his first turkey...

07:32.533 --> 07:34.558
my dad going out of town...

07:35.269 --> 07:36.395
pie.

07:36.537 --> 07:39.973
Do not blame Bobby.
I taught him to keep an open mind.

07:40.741 --> 07:42.834
Maybe I taught him too well.

07:46.214 --> 07:49.809
Come on! The naked photography books
are downstairs.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.852
Somebody's gonna buy them all
before we get a chance to even look.

07:52.954 --> 07:56.185
Is that all you think about? Photography?

07:57.425 --> 08:02.055
I only have a day to plan an authentic
Native American protest feast.

08:02.163 --> 08:06.361
And if anything has to thaw or ripen,
I gotta know now.

08:16.944 --> 08:18.002
[Redcorn exclaims]

08:22.116 --> 08:25.381
Joseph, how about this?
Running into each other.

08:25.486 --> 08:27.215
Hey, Mr. Redcorn.

08:27.321 --> 08:32.020
I had this old headdress lying around.
And I thought, well, you might like it.

08:34.227 --> 08:36.822
Horns and a feather. Thanks.

08:42.803 --> 08:44.270
John Redcorn.

08:46.073 --> 08:48.803
What in the hell
have you been telling my son?

08:48.910 --> 08:53.108
If I stole all that land, would I be living
on a dang eighth of an acre?

08:53.214 --> 08:56.615
We will rise up and reclaim
all of what was once ours.

08:56.951 --> 08:58.543
He is the spirit of our people.

08:58.653 --> 08:59.881
Bobby is?

09:00.221 --> 09:01.381
Joseph.

09:01.489 --> 09:02.456
Oh.

09:03.090 --> 09:04.250
Hank.

09:07.795 --> 09:09.092
Oh, boy.

09:10.164 --> 09:11.995
I want my son back.

09:24.145 --> 09:25.612
DALE: I don't know.

09:36.190 --> 09:38.454
MAN: I hope there'll be some apple pie.

09:48.803 --> 09:51.397
Bobby, not in front of the Boomhauers!

09:51.539 --> 09:53.632
I'm sorry, Dr. Boomhauer.

09:53.908 --> 09:55.000
What are you doing?

09:55.109 --> 09:59.671
What better way to educate than to have
my own "Thankstaking" meal?

09:59.814 --> 10:02.112
It's gonna be very in-your-face.

10:02.316 --> 10:05.774
I refuse to eat
the white man's white meat!

10:05.886 --> 10:10.255
That's it. You're going to your room.
And stay off the guests' coats.

10:10.358 --> 10:12.349
Hank, come on. Let him be.

10:13.127 --> 10:15.493
This is normal teenage rebellion.

10:15.596 --> 10:18.759
When I was his age,
I wrecked my parents' bicycle.

10:18.866 --> 10:20.163
All right, fine.

10:20.368 --> 10:24.896
But this whole anti-Thanksgiving thing
couldn't have come at a worse time.

10:26.474 --> 10:27.941
Well, the game is pretty straightforward.

10:28.042 --> 10:30.806
You can choose to spin
or you can choose to choose.

10:30.911 --> 10:35.280
If you choose to spin, you can land on
"spin," or "choice," or "lose a spin"...

10:35.383 --> 10:37.908
or "lose a choice," or "free spin"...

10:38.019 --> 10:40.283
or "free choice," or "spin again."

10:44.492 --> 10:46.119
I'll be right back.

10:46.227 --> 10:49.390
She loves the game.
But her ex-lover just showed up.

10:49.497 --> 10:52.261
Most players won't face such distractions.

10:52.933 --> 10:55.128
Hank, what's John Redcorn doing here?

10:55.236 --> 10:56.726
I thought he was here for you.

10:56.837 --> 10:59.897
Not in a while, Sug.
I'm scared he might do something stupid.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.271
Would you mind kicking him out?

11:06.113 --> 11:08.081
- Hey, John Redcorn.
- Hank.

11:08.449 --> 11:11.247
Are you here for something in particular?

11:11.385 --> 11:14.445
Because this is kind of
a family and neighbor kind of...

11:14.588 --> 11:16.556
- Bobby invited me.
- Bobby?

11:16.657 --> 11:18.750
He's just a minor.
He doesn't have the authority to...

11:18.859 --> 11:21.123
Is this because of what happened
in the car the other day?

11:21.228 --> 11:24.493
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I was crying.

11:24.598 --> 11:26.122
And you felt a little uncomfortable with...

11:26.233 --> 11:29.862
Well, I know you're here to see Bobby,
so I won't keep you.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.234
Hello, Bobby. How's the good fight?

11:34.342 --> 11:38.073
- Well, Mr. Redcorn, I found...
- There's Joseph!

11:40.481 --> 11:43.609
John Redcorn, what a pleasant surprise.
Have a beer.

11:43.851 --> 11:45.716
[Whispering] What the hell
do you think you're doing here?

11:45.820 --> 11:48.948
I'm going to talk to my son.
I bought him a skateboard.

11:49.056 --> 11:53.049
He's already got a skateboard,
and a helmet, and a father! So, leave.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.721
John Redcorn, hey.
Here's something to be thankful for.

11:56.831 --> 11:59.527
You got a settlement offer
from the government.

11:59.633 --> 12:02.693
Twelve delicious acres
of unincorporated Arlen.

12:03.137 --> 12:07.130
Twelve? I was seeking 130,000.

12:07.808 --> 12:10.868
There's no way I'm accepting this insult.

12:11.278 --> 12:14.714
Come on. Twelve's a lot.
Eleven of them are connected.

12:14.915 --> 12:19.682
The other one's across the highway.
If you don't want them, I'll take them.

12:21.589 --> 12:24.854
You're right. This is something to drink to.

12:26.227 --> 12:28.718
DALE: May I have your attention, everyone?

12:28.929 --> 12:33.423
I would just like to make a toast
to our friend, John Redcorn III...

12:33.667 --> 12:37.034
celebrating the return of 12 acres of land.

12:37.138 --> 12:41.131
Almost 0.001% of what he was seeking.

12:41.442 --> 12:42.602
Kudos.

12:43.177 --> 12:44.701
All right, then.

12:46.447 --> 12:47.846
Joseph hates me.

12:47.948 --> 12:51.247
Why would Joseph hate you?
He barely knows you.

12:56.590 --> 12:58.854
I would also like to make a toast...

12:58.959 --> 13:03.794
to the white man who steals our land
and steals our sons.

13:04.198 --> 13:05.825
To the white man!

13:07.601 --> 13:09.159
To the white man?

13:15.676 --> 13:17.268
What the hell.

13:17.378 --> 13:21.815
Bobby, if you have anything nice to say
about the American Indians...

13:21.916 --> 13:23.850
now would be a good time.

13:24.618 --> 13:27.678
Thank you for finally hearing our voice.

13:30.424 --> 13:33.052
My friend John Redcorn...

13:33.160 --> 13:37.563
has taught me about how important
the history of his people is...

13:37.665 --> 13:39.860
especially on this day.

13:40.301 --> 13:43.429
And I am the only one who saw fit...

13:43.537 --> 13:47.337
to prepare a feast
that honors the Native American culture...

13:47.608 --> 13:50.475
not my land-grabbing ancestors.

13:51.679 --> 13:55.911
According to many expensive books
I studied at the bookstore...

13:56.150 --> 13:59.119
the Anasazi tribe from this region...

13:59.286 --> 14:04.189
celebrated their most festive occasions
by eating the body of their enemies.

14:04.925 --> 14:08.691
Anthropologists have found the leftovers
of these sacred meals...

14:09.129 --> 14:11.757
human bones with shiny patches...

14:11.932 --> 14:15.527
as if rubbed smooth
against the walls of cooking pots.

14:16.470 --> 14:19.735
So, today we salute
the Native American cannibal...

14:19.840 --> 14:21.831
or people-eater.

14:21.942 --> 14:23.500
It is in this spirit...

14:23.677 --> 14:28.512
that I invite you to enjoy
a Native American cannibal feast.

14:29.683 --> 14:32.914
Mr. Redcorn. This head's for you.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.880
Oh, man. You eat people?

14:36.190 --> 14:38.215
Joseph, don't listen to him.

14:38.392 --> 14:40.587
That was over 700 years ago!

14:40.694 --> 14:43.492
Get your hands off me, you cannibal freak!

14:57.778 --> 15:02.147
John Redcorn, it's me.
I brought you a to-go plate...

15:02.416 --> 15:03.974
it's the neck and gibs.

15:04.218 --> 15:07.244
They were this close
to giving them to the dog.

15:08.389 --> 15:11.119
Look, I feel terrible for what Joseph said.

15:11.225 --> 15:14.786
My son has all the Gribble passion
with none of the Gribble charm.

15:14.895 --> 15:16.192
Your son?

15:16.597 --> 15:21.466
Yes, I've been meaning to talk to you
about "your son." Sit down.

15:25.306 --> 15:29.675
Fourteen years ago,
I was gassing up my jeep, and I met...

15:36.250 --> 15:38.650
Do I still need to use an ashtray?

15:40.087 --> 15:43.750
You want me to consult the rule book,
Dr. Boomhauer? Fine...

15:44.325 --> 15:45.587
you lose.

15:47.695 --> 15:50.425
Sorry. I thought you were Mr. Redcorn.

15:51.031 --> 15:53.056
That guy creeps me out.

15:53.167 --> 15:56.762
John Redcorn is a good man
who's lost everything important to him.

15:56.870 --> 16:00.465
Yeah, his stupid land. Get over it already.

16:00.574 --> 16:04.032
Joseph John Gribble,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

16:04.345 --> 16:09.112
What if your father lost the places he
hunted, and fished, and lived, and loved?

16:10.985 --> 16:14.751
Maybe it's my fault you don't understand
anything about his heritage.

16:15.022 --> 16:16.956
It's time we had a talk.

16:19.159 --> 16:21.150
Okay. How about this?

16:21.895 --> 16:24.557
Some things in life just happen.

16:25.065 --> 16:27.295
You don't want to hurt anyone, but...

16:28.936 --> 16:32.303
Come on. So Joseph called you a cannibal.

16:32.473 --> 16:35.306
It's not like it's true, is it?

16:35.843 --> 16:39.142
Of course not.
Any cultural anthropologist will tell you...

16:39.246 --> 16:43.478
that the Anasazi tribe last practiced
cannibalism over 700 years ago!

16:43.584 --> 16:46.747
And you are affiliated with what tribe?

16:46.854 --> 16:49.084
Dale, I don't eat people!

16:49.189 --> 16:52.716
For God's sake! It would be like
me accusing you of cannibalism...

16:52.826 --> 16:56.557
just because that nut in Michigan who
boiled body parts on his stove was white.

16:56.664 --> 17:00.464
And that disc jockey in Philadelphia
who ate people in his basement.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.057
Also white.

17:02.169 --> 17:05.832
Boy, you're really up on your cannibalism,
John Redcorn.

17:05.939 --> 17:09.932
- Well, look at the time.
- It just makes me so angry.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.775
You should know I'm highly carcinogenic.

17:15.015 --> 17:19.645
Okay, that bell means you get a chance
to spin the prize wheel.

17:19.752 --> 17:21.846
I came up with the prize wheel
late last night.

17:21.954 --> 17:26.085
So picture this as a 30-foot wheel
that spins.

17:26.226 --> 17:28.194
Bill, spin my arm.

17:32.933 --> 17:34.127
Come on!

17:36.036 --> 17:37.663
Come on!

17:38.172 --> 17:42.074
I win a Winnebago!

17:44.745 --> 17:48.146
So close! I spun it a little too hard.

17:51.919 --> 17:53.352
[Phone ringing]

17:53.554 --> 17:54.578
Hello?

17:54.688 --> 17:57.350
John Redcorn's kidnapped me
and he's going to eat me.

17:57.458 --> 18:01.189
You're with John Redcorn?
Has he told you anything?

18:01.295 --> 18:04.423
He's playing it very coy.
You have to save me, Hank.

18:04.565 --> 18:06.328
Now, here's the plan.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.597
[Makes whispering sounds]

18:09.470 --> 18:11.563
Dale, you're just going...
[Makes whispering sounds]

18:11.672 --> 18:13.230
Well, I've got nothing!

18:14.641 --> 18:18.702
Peggy, I got to go for a spin
to pick up Dale.

18:18.946 --> 18:21.813
He's over at Redcorn's,
scared out of his pants.

18:21.915 --> 18:23.439
I want to go.

18:23.617 --> 18:26.745
I want to go, too. For Mr. Redcorn.

18:27.054 --> 18:31.081
- Bobby, haven't you done enough to him?
- It's my choice.

18:31.425 --> 18:32.949
Then give me your choice card.

18:33.961 --> 18:38.625
I'm glad the Cowboys lost today,
after all they did to the Indians.

18:38.899 --> 18:41.561
Damn it, don't go dragging them into this.

18:41.902 --> 18:45.804
You're already in enough trouble.
You called John Redcorn a cannibal.

18:45.973 --> 18:48.874
That's one of the worst things
you can call a person.

18:48.976 --> 18:50.170
No, it's not!

18:50.277 --> 18:55.180
The New York Times says cannibalism
is part of his cultural heritage.

18:55.482 --> 18:59.248
And you have to respect
other people's culture.

18:59.353 --> 19:01.184
Who are we to judge?

19:01.989 --> 19:05.152
I am not judging,
I am stating a simple fact.

19:05.259 --> 19:07.989
It is wrong to eat human beings.

19:08.095 --> 19:09.289
Says you.

19:09.396 --> 19:14.026
Yes. And I'll say it again.
It is wrong to eat another human being.

19:14.201 --> 19:16.601
But it was right for the white man...

19:16.737 --> 19:20.901
to throw blankets with smallpox
onto the Indian reservations?

19:21.008 --> 19:25.342
No. That was wrong, too.
But so is eating human beings.

19:28.682 --> 19:32.379
Bobby, I agree
that stealing Indians' land was wrong.

19:32.486 --> 19:35.353
Can't you agree
that eating people is wrong?

19:36.390 --> 19:38.654
- I guess.
- There you go.

19:39.393 --> 19:41.987
You know, I left one turkey uncarved.

19:42.362 --> 19:44.387
Can I have the knife back?

19:44.498 --> 19:47.797
You sure can, Bobby.
But you barely need a knife...

19:47.935 --> 19:51.462
'cause that bad boy
is so goddang succulent.

19:58.946 --> 19:59.913
[Dale exclaims]

20:00.214 --> 20:02.682
So, what did you say to Dale?

20:02.783 --> 20:04.410
Nothing yet.

20:04.952 --> 20:07.819
I can't believe she left me for that.

20:08.021 --> 20:09.955
She didn't leave you for that.

20:10.057 --> 20:13.026
She married that
two years before she met you.

20:19.366 --> 20:22.426
- Dad!
- Joseph's here? Good.

20:22.603 --> 20:24.798
I can tell both of them at the same time.

20:24.905 --> 20:28.033
Get back in the truck behind Bobby
where you're safe.

20:28.141 --> 20:31.440
It's okay. He's not going to eat anyone.

20:31.545 --> 20:34.912
Mr. Redcorn,
I know you're not really a cannibal.

20:35.249 --> 20:38.184
My mom told me.
She told me a lot of things.

20:38.719 --> 20:40.414
Really? Like what?

20:40.754 --> 20:44.315
How the white man stole your land
and your heritage...

20:44.558 --> 20:47.026
and that it's time you got it back...

20:47.327 --> 20:50.592
and how we're all children of the earth.

20:50.731 --> 20:54.030
So in a weird way, we're related.

20:56.136 --> 20:59.003
So what did you want to tell us,
Kemo Sabe?

21:00.107 --> 21:03.406
I think I will take those 12 acres after all.

21:04.144 --> 21:08.171
And then, upon my death, I would like
to pass the land on to you, Dale...

21:08.849 --> 21:10.316
for all the help you've given me.

21:10.417 --> 21:11.543
Score!

21:11.952 --> 21:15.820
Then Joseph will live
on my forefathers' land after you die.

21:16.290 --> 21:18.349
Thanks, Capt. Bring-Down.

21:20.127 --> 21:21.856
[Cars honking constantly]

21:26.667 --> 21:29.067
This is nice land, John Redcorn.

21:29.403 --> 21:31.496
With a little TLC...

21:31.605 --> 21:34.699
[Loud traffic noises] I bet you could turn
this into a real nice place.

21:34.808 --> 21:37.777
Maybe put up a garden and a fence and...

21:37.878 --> 21:40.278
I am thinking about suing
the Highway Department...

21:40.380 --> 21:42.814
to put in a sound-dampening fence.

22:27.327 --> 22:29.386
HANK: Oh, my God, it's so juicy.
