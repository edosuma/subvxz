WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:04.705
[indistinct chatter]

00:08.376 --> 00:11.212
- I SEE WHY THEY CALL THIS PLACE
"HELL ON WHEELS"--

00:11.245 --> 00:12.746
ROUGH MEN, LOOSE WOMEN,

00:12.780 --> 00:15.383
WHISKEY, SIN, AND GUNS.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.252
- IT AIN'T
A CHURCH SOCIAL, MA'AM.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.653
- I'M NOT SURE YOUR BOSSES
AT CREDIT MOBILIER

00:19.687 --> 00:22.690
WOULD WANT ME TO PUT THAT
IN THE NEWSPAPER.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.459
WHAT IS IT THAT HOLDS YOU TO
THIS ENTERPRISE, MR. BOHANNON?

00:25.493 --> 00:26.627
- EVERY PIECE OF STEEL WE LAY

00:26.660 --> 00:28.596
PUTS US CLOSER
TO SOMEWHERES ELSE.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.731
THAT'S ABOUT ALL
I CAN SAY.

00:30.764 --> 00:35.203
- SO IT'S MORE PERSONAL
THAN JUST LAYING RAIL.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.572
- YOU'RE THE WRITER.
HO!

00:38.606 --> 00:40.774
- MR. BOHANNON,
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY

00:40.808 --> 00:44.312
BELIEVE THE RAILROAD IS ROBBING
THE NATIONAL TREASURY.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.514
MY JOB IS TO DISSUADE MY READERS
OF THAT NOTION.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.250
UNFORTUNATELY,
OUR BRIEF INTERVIEW

00:49.283 --> 00:51.385
WAS NOT ENOUGH
TO DISSUADE ME.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.255
- AND IT AIN'T MY JOB
TO FIX WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.756
- IN FACT, IT IS.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.326
YOU ARE THE FACE OF THE
TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD NOW.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.794
AND EITHER THIS IS
A BRAVE AND NOBLE ENDEAVOR,

01:00.828 --> 01:03.264
OR IT'S SODOM AND GOMORRAH.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.634
WHICH IS IT?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.502
THE SOONER YOU HELP ME
ACCURATELY REPORT

01:08.536 --> 01:09.803
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE,
THE SOONER I CAN LEAVE

01:09.837 --> 01:12.640
AND MAKE BOTH OUR LIVES
LESS MISERABLE.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.808
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I COVERED THE WAR '63 TO '65.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.545
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HELL AND A CHURCH SOCIAL.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.680
- WHAT MORE YOU NEED TO SEE?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.349
- EVERYTHING.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.288

01:33.594 --> 01:35.796

01:35.829 --> 01:38.399
100 MILES WEST,
SURVEYORS LAY OUT THE ROUTE.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.668
- HOW MANY MEN DO YOU HAVE?
- NEAR 3,000.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.803
WORK SIX DAYS A WEEK,
SUNUP, SUNDOWN.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.806
$1.50 A DAY.
THEM'S GOOD WAGES.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.309
- HOW MANY MILES
DO YOU MAKE A DAY?

01:48.342 --> 01:51.379
- TWO NOW,
WEATHER AND INDIANS PERMITTIN'.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.284
RUST EATERS LAY THE RAILS.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.586
WALKING BOSS MAKES SURE
THE GAUGE IS RIGHT.

01:58.619 --> 02:02.556
SPIKER TEAMS SECURE THE RAILS
TO THE GROUND.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.458
FISH-PLATES TIE THEM TOGETHER.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.494
3 SWINGS OF THE HAMMER
PER SPIKE,

02:06.527 --> 02:10.298
10 SPIKES PER RAIL,
400 RAILS TO A MILE,

02:10.331 --> 02:13.334
1,500 MILES TO SACRAMENTO.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.338
- DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
YOU CAN WIN THE RACE

02:17.371 --> 02:18.772
AGAINST THE CENTRAL PACIFIC
TO BUILD THIS ROAD?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.474
- WOULDN'T BE HERE OTHERWISE.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.842
- DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO IT

02:21.875 --> 02:24.312
WITHOUT THOMAS DURANT'S
POLITICAL CONNECTIONS?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.580
WITHOUT HIS MONEY
AND HIS EGO TO DRIVE IT ON?

02:26.614 --> 02:29.417
- WELL, HERE I STAND
AND HERE HE DON'T.

02:29.450 --> 02:33.487
EXCUSE ME.
- ONE MORE QUESTION.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.755
WHY YOU?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.869
- EACH CAR SLEEPS 60 MEN.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.872
KEEPS THEM OUT OF THE WEATHER
AND CLOSE TO THE WORK.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.908
LADY COMING THROUGH.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.349
- WHO DESIGNED THESE CARS?

03:01.382 --> 03:02.550
- MOSTLY ME.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.386
- [belches]
- [clears throat]

03:05.419 --> 03:08.756
- YEAH, I'M STILL WORKING OUT
THE VENTILATION.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.591
- MM-HMM.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.360
- TWO WEEKS AGO, THESE MEN
WERE STARVING, OUT OF WORK,

03:12.393 --> 03:13.961
STRAIGHT OFF THE BOATS
IN NEW YORK.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.563
- MY NEWSPAPER HAS REPORTED
IRISH LABOR BOSSES

03:15.596 --> 03:17.365
CONSCRIPTING THEM OUT HERE
FOR A FEE.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.900
HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT
FROM INDENTURED SERVITUDE?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.902
- UNION PACIFIC OFFERS
FREE RAIL PASSAGE

03:21.935 --> 03:23.937
AND A WEEK'S WAGES
ON ARRIVAL.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.773
WE GOT MORE APPLICANTS
THAN WE GOT WORK.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.508
- REALLY?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.378
YOUR IDEA AGAIN?

03:30.411 --> 03:34.848
- DIDN'T MUCH CARE FOR THE LABOR
BOSSES I MET IN NEW YORK.

AIN'T A DAY GOES BY
WE DON'T PUT SOME ONE OR TWO

03:51.599 --> 03:55.936
IN THE GROUND UP THERE,
MOST FROM RAILROAD MISHAPS.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.439
- AND THE OTHERS?

03:58.472 --> 04:02.710
- SPARE-TIME MISHAPS.

04:02.743 --> 04:07.615
- IS THAT WHERE THE FAIR-HAIRED
MAIDEN OF THE WEST IS BURIED?

04:10.684 --> 04:13.854
- NO, SHE'S BURIED IN
A WILD-FLOWER FIELD SHE LIKED.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.657
- DID YOU KNOW HER?
- A BIT.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.958
- WELL, YOU MUST'VE KNOWN HER
BETTER THAN THAT

04:17.991 --> 04:20.561
IF YOU KNEW WHERE SHE WANTED
TO BE BURIED.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.430
- MS. BELL SHOULD'VE LEFT
HELL ON WHEELS

04:22.463 --> 04:23.664
WHEN SHE HAD THE CHANCE.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.966
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR A LADY,

04:25.999 --> 04:29.537
LESS'N SHE'S A WHORE.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.539
- I CAN ASSURE YOU,
MR. BOHANNON,

04:31.572 --> 04:33.441
I AM NEITHER A LADY
NOR A WHORE.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.443
- I FIGURED YOU'D HAVE TO BE
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH,

04:35.476 --> 04:37.445
BEING A NEWSPAPER WOMAN.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.547
GET OUT OF HERE.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.582

- NO.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.149

06:56.183 --> 06:58.619
- WELL, I CAN TELL BY LOOKING,
YOU AIN'T SHORT A HAT SIZE,

06:58.652 --> 07:00.854
SO I GUESS YOU KNOW.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.657
I'M NEW CHIEF

07:03.691 --> 07:07.127
YOU WORK FOR ME NOW.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.762
COFFEE?

07:08.796 --> 07:10.598
MY GRANDPAP TAUGHT ME
HOW TO MAKE IT.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.700
THE TRICK IS NOT TO OVERBOIL...

07:12.733 --> 07:16.169
AND, OF COURSE, THE SOCK.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.871
NOW, UH, I USE A CLEAN ONE.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.874
BUT PAP SWORE
THE RIPER THE SOCK,

07:20.908 --> 07:23.143
THE RICHER THE BREW.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.614
I LIKE A DOLLOP OF FRESH CREAM
IN MINE,

07:26.647 --> 07:29.617
BUT IT AIN'T REAL REGULAR
I COME ACROSS IT.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.854
AND KICKING DON'T GET YOU
NOWHERE LESS'N YOU'RE A MULE.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.925
SO, MOSTLY,
I JUST TAKE MINE BLACK.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.793
- MR. BOHANNON
AIN'T SAID NOTHING

07:39.827 --> 07:43.163
ABOUT ME WORKING
FOR NOBODY.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.899
- WELL, IT AIN'T NO GOOD
COLD NOW.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.801
GO ON.

07:54.074 --> 07:58.011
THAT'S IT.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.847

08:19.833 --> 08:23.003
CAME TO TALK.
- WHAT ABOUT?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.838
- THINK YOU KNOW.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.986

ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE,

09:04.945 --> 09:08.315
SOMEBODY COMES,
TAKES YOUR LAND.

09:08.348 --> 09:12.119
- EVERYTHING I HAD'S BEEN TOOK.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.955
- INDIANS KILLED MY FATHER
AND MY BROTHER,

09:14.988 --> 09:16.990
HIS WIVES AND KIDS.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.160
MY WIVES AND I, WE BURIED 'EM
ON THE SAME HILL

09:20.193 --> 09:23.831
I PULLED YOUR SURVEYOR STAKES
OUT OF.

MY FAMILY BLED FOR THIS LAND,
MR. BOHANNON,

09:26.033 --> 09:30.771
CARVED THIS PLACE OUT
OF A WILDERNESS NOBODY WANTED.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.976
IT IS
BY HEAVENLY FATHER'S DECREE

09:36.009 --> 09:39.179
THAT WE ARE HERE,
AND IT SHALL BE BY HIS WILL,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.148
NOT YOURS, THAT WE LEAVE.

09:41.181 --> 09:45.052
- EVEN GOD CAN'T STOP
THE RAILROAD, MR. HATCH.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.023
- IT WOULD DESTROY
ALL WE BUILT,

09:50.057 --> 09:53.093
TAKE AWAY OUR HOME.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.962
- MM.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.197
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.032
YOU'LL GET A SQUARE DEAL.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.034
NOW, NOW,
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.904
- COULD GO AROUND.
- BOY.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.139
- AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT WILDERNESS
AND LAMONITES OUT HERE, FATHER.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.375
- I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.190
YOU WILL EXCUSE
MY SON'S MANNERS.

10:23.223 --> 10:27.227
HE'S GOT SOME GROWING
STILL TO DO.

10:34.167 --> 10:38.338
- [sighs]

10:38.371 --> 10:43.176
TELL YOU WHAT.
UM...

10:43.210 --> 10:45.946
LET ME SEE IF MY SURVEYORS
CAN'T FIND A WAY AROUND.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.882
NOW, THAT--
THAT'S NOT A PROMISE.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.384
IF IT CAN'T BE DONE,
YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO MOVE.

10:51.418 --> 10:56.056
BUT IT DON'T COST NOTHING
TO TRY.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.429
- WELL, A JOURNEY
THROUGH THESE LANDS

11:02.462 --> 11:06.233
AT THIS HOUR IS A FOOLISH ONE,
MR. BOHANNON.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.302

DURING THE WAR.
[grunts]

12:25.545 --> 12:28.381

HAVE NOTHING TO FIGHT ABOUT,

12:28.415 --> 12:30.317
COUNTY SHERIFF RUN HIM THROUGH
WITH A SWORD

12:30.350 --> 12:32.920
ON ACCOUNT OF HIM

"POLYGAMIST."

12:58.245 --> 13:00.480
- [exhales]
WHAT'D I SAY?

13:00.513 --> 13:03.116
- "PALGEMISTS."

13:03.150 --> 13:04.985
- WELL, I KNEW IT WAS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.353
WHY A MAN GOTTA GET
HISSELF KILLED

13:06.386 --> 13:08.221
OVER BEING A POLYGAMIST?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.957
- IT'S THE CUSTOM
OF HAVING MORE THAN ONE WIFE

13:09.990 --> 13:11.224
AT THE SAME TIME.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.160
- MORE THAN ONE WIFE,
YOU SAY?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.128
AT THE SAME TIME?

13:15.162 --> 13:18.065
WELL, DAMN.
NO WONDER THEY NASTY.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.106
- SAND, MUD, LIME.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
- SOIL LIKE THAT NO GOOD
FOR THE GRADE, BOSS.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.011
TAKE A LOT OF LUMBER
TO BUILD IT.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.246
YEAH, ROCK WALL WILL BE BETTER,
BUT THAT TAKE TIME

13:33.280 --> 13:35.348

13:38.085 --> 13:40.553
SAND HILLS STRETCH AT LEAST
A HUNDRED MILES TO THE NORTH.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.389
WE'D HAVE TO GO SOUTH
TO GET AROUND THAT FARM.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.557
- HOW FAR?
- 40 MILE, MAYBE MORE.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.526

- I MET THE NEW POLICE CHIEF.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.490
- YOU AIN'T HAPPY,
TRACK RUNS BOTH WAYS.

14:20.327 --> 14:24.464
[bell continues ringing]

14:24.497 --> 14:27.167
WHERE'S THE LIVESTOCK?
- IT'S COMPLICATED.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.570
- TELL YOU WHAT'S COMPLICATED,
SON--3,000 HUNGRY MEN.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.439
- WHAT I MEAN IS

14:32.472 --> 14:36.043
I'VE BEEN ON THE JOB
FOR TWO DAYS.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.145
AND DECIPHERING THESE BOOKS
IS QUITE THE TASK.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.147
NEAR AS I CAN TELL,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.049
MR. DURANT FORMED
SEVERAL COMPANIES

14:42.082 --> 14:45.085
TO SUPPLY LIVESTOCK
TO THE RAILROAD.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.287
NOW THAT HE'S DEPARTED,

14:47.320 --> 14:51.424
THE CONTRACTS
HAVE BEEN CANCELED.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.326
- THEN FIND SOME OTHER
DAMN PLACE, SEAN.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.195
COUNCIL BLUFFS, DENVER,
SHIT, CHICAGO--

14:55.228 --> 14:59.199
- I WOULD, UM, BUT IT SEEMS
THAT MR. DURANT HAS,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.601
IN ADDITION TO CANCELING
OUR CONTRACTS

15:01.634 --> 15:03.570
WITH HIS COMPANIES,

15:03.603 --> 15:06.539
CORNERED THE MARKET ON LIVESTOCK
IN OMAHA AS WELL.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.541
- SHIT!

15:08.575 --> 15:10.477
SHOULD'VE KILLED THAT SON OF
A BITCH WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.613
- MAY I QUOTE YOU ON THAT,
MR. BOHANNON?

15:17.550 --> 15:19.552
- YOU DON'T SAY NOTHING TO HER
ABOUT RAILROAD BUSINESS.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.422
YOU HEAR ME?
- YES, SIR.

15:22.455 --> 15:26.226
- STILL HERE?
- MISSED MY TRAIN.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.429
- DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.369
[knock at door]

15:36.403 --> 15:38.171
- OH.

15:38.205 --> 15:41.241
WE MISSED YOU AT SERVICES
THIS MORNING, MR. BOHANNON.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.377
- [laughs]

15:44.411 --> 15:47.647
- WAS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

15:47.680 --> 15:50.617
- THOUGHT I'D LOOK IN IS ALL.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.222
- YOU GAVE US
A GOOD PLACE...

15:55.255 --> 15:57.557
HIGH, DRY GROUND,

15:57.590 --> 16:01.128
UPWIND OF THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.696
THANK YOU.
- IT'S GOOD.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.599
IT'S GOOD FOR THE MEN,
I MEAN.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.306
- AND YOU?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.746
- OH. SORRY.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.182
UH...
[sniffs]

16:22.215 --> 16:25.185
RAILROAD HAS TO MOVE A FAMILY
OF HOMESTEADERS OFF THEIR LAND.

16:25.218 --> 16:29.422
THEY'RE DIGGING IN.
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE MORMON.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.623
I WONDER IF YOU'VE HAD
ANY CAUSE TO KNOW

16:30.657 --> 16:33.760
WHAT THEY MIGHT BE LIKE
AS PEOPLE.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.562
- THE LATTER DAY SAINTS
ARE NOT

16:35.595 --> 16:38.465
A LEGITIMATE CHURCH
OF CHRIST.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.500
THEY TREAT THEIR WOMEN
AS SLAVES.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.602
THEY TAKE CHILD BRIDES.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.404
THEY'RE A VIOLENT PEOPLE.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.473
- THEY'LL FIGHT, THEN,
YOU THINK?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.708
- IT HAS BEEN THEIR WAY.
YES.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.278
- THEY GOT CHILDREN
WITH 'EM.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.280
- THEN YOU'LL FIND
ANOTHER WAY...

16:53.313 --> 16:55.582
BY GOD'S GRACE.

16:55.615 --> 16:59.486
- GOD'S BEEN SLACK
WITH THE GRACE OF LATE.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.258
- THEN SHOW THEM YOURS,
MR. BOHANNON.

17:09.629 --> 17:13.466
- WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS
A MAJOR NEW COMMERCIAL HUB,

17:13.500 --> 17:16.736
THE MOST IMPORTANT RAILROAD CITY
IN THE UNITED STATES.

17:16.769 --> 17:21.641
AND IT'LL BE RIGHT HERE
IN YOUR BACKYARD.

17:21.674 --> 17:26.479
- THAT IS LITERALLY
MY BACKYARD.

17:26.513 --> 17:30.217
YOU SEE THAT PRETTY CONFLUENCE
OF GOOD SWEET-WATER STREAMS?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.520
WELL, IT AIN'T MUCH,
BUT IT'S ON MY LAND.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.489
MY HUSBAND LEFT ME ALL OF THIS
WHEN HE PASSED IN '62.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.292
- WELL, IT MAY BE
YOUR LAND NOW, MADAM.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.328
BUT THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD

17:41.361 --> 17:42.762
WILL REACH IT BEFORE THE YEAR
IS OUT.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.765
AND THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN,
THEY WILL CLAIM IT.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.334
- THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.435
- IT IS THE LAW.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.237
AND BY LAW,

17:50.270 --> 17:52.439
THE UNION PACIFIC
IS COMPELLED TO OFFER YOU

17:52.472 --> 17:54.674
A FAIR MARKET PRICE
FOR YOUR LAND,

17:54.707 --> 17:57.544
CURRENTLY $1.50 AN ACRE.
[laughter]

17:57.577 --> 18:00.480
- I'D NEVER SELL FOR THAT.
- AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO...

18:00.513 --> 18:02.382
BECAUSE AS A REPRESENTATIVE

18:02.415 --> 18:05.485
AND MAJOR STOCKHOLDER
OF CREDIT MOBILIER,

18:05.518 --> 18:09.322
I AM PREPARED
TO OFFER YOU $100 PER ACRE,

18:09.356 --> 18:14.261
THUS WAIVING
EMINENT DOMAIN.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.796
- WHAT'S THE RUB?
- AH, WELL...

18:16.829 --> 18:19.866
IN ORDER TO WAIVE
EMINENT DOMAIN,

18:19.899 --> 18:23.336
WE MUST BUILD
A RAILROAD TERMINUS

18:23.370 --> 18:24.871
AND A TOWN
ON THE PROPERTY,

18:24.904 --> 18:26.806
WHICH WE WILL.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.808
EVERY POUND OF BEEF,
EVERY TON OF ORE,

18:28.841 --> 18:31.878
EVERY FRUIT, VEGETABLE,
EVERY BALE OF HAY

18:31.911 --> 18:34.714
FROM EITHER SIDE
OF THE MISSISSIPPI

18:34.747 --> 18:38.385
MUST SHIP THROUGH OUR TOWN.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.554
YOU WILL BECOME RICH
BEYOND YOUR WILDEST DREAMS.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.822
- WEREN'T YOU IN JAIL
JUST A MONTH AGO?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.557
- YES.
- AND YOU'RE BROKE,

18:44.591 --> 18:45.558
ACCORDING TO THE NEWSPAPERS.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.793
- FLAT BROKE.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.860
- WELL, HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO PAY US

18:47.894 --> 18:49.362
FOR OUR PROPERTY, THEN?

18:49.396 --> 18:51.664
- FROM CONSTRUCTION FUNDS

18:51.698 --> 18:54.434
ADVANCED TO ME
BY THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.636
- YOU WERE KICKED OFF
UNION PACIFIC FOR STEALING.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.339
- UNION PACIFIC,
CREDIT MOBILIER,

18:59.372 --> 19:02.542
DIFFERENT POCKETS
TO THE SAME PAIR OF PANTS.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.911
WHEN THE JUDGE UNDERSTOOD THAT,
I WAS RELEASED.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.846
- YOU'RE IN OMAHA NOW,
NEW YORK.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.581
MONEY WON'T BUY YOU
JUDGES HERE.

19:08.615 --> 19:12.685
- OPPORTUNITY IS A POWERFUL
ELIXIR, MRS. PALMER.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.587
- RIGHT.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.557
SO YOU'RE BORROWING MONEY
YOU DON'T HAVE

19:17.590 --> 19:19.459
FROM A COMPANY
YOU DON'T WORK FOR

19:19.492 --> 19:20.860
TO BUY PROPERTY
YOU CAN'T AFFORD

19:20.893 --> 19:22.862
TO BUILD A CITY
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.464
- SPEARHEADING, AS IT WERE.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.500
A NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS
IN AMERICA.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.876
IF ALL DIFFICULTIES
WERE KNOWN

19:36.909 --> 19:39.879
AT THE OUTSET OF A LONG JOURNEY,
MR. MCGINNIS,

19:39.912 --> 19:43.916
FEW OF US WOULD EVER
EMBARK AT ALL.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.689
A WHISKEY
FOR MY YOUNG FRIEND.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.529
HAVE YOU GOT THE MONEY?

20:02.935 --> 20:05.672
- I'M VERY UNEASY ABOUT THIS.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.574
IF MR. BOHANNON FINDS OUT--

20:07.607 --> 20:09.676
- YOU ARE DOING NOTHING WRONG.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.811
YOU ARE MANAGING
RAILROAD FUNDS,

20:11.844 --> 20:16.383
AND YOU ARE
MANAGING THEM WELL.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.419
HAVE YOU GOT
SOMETHING ELSE FOR ME?

20:23.990 --> 20:27.827
- THIS IS THE, UH,
TELEGRAPH ROUTING CODE

20:27.860 --> 20:30.763
FOR THE UNION PACIFIC.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.632
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO EAVESDROP

20:32.665 --> 20:34.967
ON ALL OF
MR. BOHANNON'S BUSINESS.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.770
- EXCELLENT.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.743
AHH.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.413
- WILL YOU BE PAYING
ME TODAY, MR. DURANT?

20:46.446 --> 20:50.650
- ALL IN DUE TIME,
MR. MCGINNIS.

20:50.683 --> 20:55.488
OH, DON'T LOOK SO GLUM.

20:55.522 --> 21:00.560
MY CURRENT SITUATION
IS BUT A TEMPORARY SETBACK.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.464
HISTORY ALWAYS SIDES
WITH A WINNER.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.837
[overlapping conversations]

21:13.005 --> 21:14.807
- WHERE ARE YOU
OFF TO SO FAST?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.609
- EXCUSE ME, I'M--

21:16.643 --> 21:18.811
UM...

21:18.845 --> 21:20.647
UH, STOP, NO.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.848
OW, LET ME GO.

21:21.881 --> 21:22.882
- GIVE US A KISS FIRST.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.717
- WHAT?

21:24.751 --> 21:25.985
[grunting]

21:26.018 --> 21:27.820
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
PLEASE, PLEASE.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.857
NOT LIKE THIS.
LET'S GO TO MY ROOM, HUH?

21:32.859 --> 21:35.728
- I GOT US A BOTTLE
WE CAN SHARE.

21:35.762 --> 21:39.065
- TOUCH ME AGAIN,
IT'LL BE YOUR THROAT!

21:42.902 --> 21:45.071
- BLOODY WHORE.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.874
[chuckling]

21:54.781 --> 21:56.082
- MY GRANDPAP,

21:56.115 --> 21:57.884
A DOUGH PUNCHER
FROM WAY BACK,

21:57.917 --> 22:00.887
TAUGHT ME SUREST WAY
TO A WOMAN'S HEART

22:00.920 --> 22:02.655
BY WAY OF HER STOMACH.

22:02.689 --> 22:07.827
BY GOD, IF THAT WASN'T
CERTAIN WITH MY TESS.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.564
YOU MARRIED, MR. FERGUSON?

22:11.598 --> 22:13.900
- SOME COULD CALL IT THAT.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.902
- KIDS?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.837
- GOT ME A NEW BABY GIRL.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.673
- NOTHING LIKE A NEW BABY TO
MAKE A MAN COUNT HIS BLESSINGS

22:20.707 --> 22:21.974
AND KEEP THEM CLOSE.

22:22.008 --> 22:25.545
I GOT FIVE YOUNGSTERS,
ALL GIRLS,

22:25.578 --> 22:26.713
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

22:26.746 --> 22:31.017
THE OLDEST ONE'S
12 GOING ON 40.

22:31.050 --> 22:35.121
- THAT LITTLE GIRL OF MINE,
SHE BEAUTIFUL.

22:35.154 --> 22:39.091
I LOOK IN HER EYES,
AND SHE MELT MY HEART.

22:39.125 --> 22:44.731
BUT HER MAMA AFRAID THIS JOB
GONNA GET ME KILLED.

22:44.764 --> 22:48.568
SHE THINK THAT BABY AIN'T GONNA
HAVE NO DADDY TO BRING HER UP.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.541
- HOW'S THE COFFEE?

22:54.574 --> 22:56.909
- IT'S BETTER THE SECOND DAY.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.878
- IT'S THE SOCK.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.147
- NEED YOU BOYS TO RIDE OUT
AND TELL THEM HOMESTEADERS

23:01.180 --> 23:02.849
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND
THE LAND.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.751
THIS HERE'S THE WRIT
OF EMINENT DOMAIN.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.118
LET THEM KNOW THE GOVERNMENT
PAYS $1.50 AN ACRE.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.855
RAILROAD WILL THROW IN
ANOTHER DOLLAR.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.823
LET HIM KNOW THAT'S MORE
THAN FAIR, ALL RIGHT?

23:10.857 --> 23:11.958
- YES, SIR.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.694
- OH, YOU DO THE TALKING.

23:14.727 --> 23:18.097
MORMONS AIN'T KEEN ON NEGROES.

23:18.130 --> 23:22.034

MR. FERGUSON.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.706
I GOT TO VISIT
THE NECESSARY.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.808
THEN WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.846
- THEY SAID
HE WAS A HELL-RAISER,

23:33.880 --> 23:37.984
BUT MY PAP WAS A LAZY SON OF
A BITCH BY THE TIME I KNEW HIM.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.653
IN FACT, ONE TIME
WHEN I WAS, OH, NINE--

23:40.687 --> 23:42.188
- DON'T YOU EVER STOP TALKING?

23:42.221 --> 23:44.824
- NO, SIR, I DO NOT.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.994
OUT HERE, A QUIET MAN IS TWICE
AS LIKELY AS A NOISY ONE

23:48.027 --> 23:51.030

24:01.874 --> 24:04.777
HORSES STILL IN THE BARN.

THAT'S WHAT
WE COME TO TELL YOU.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.746

WE GOT TO A DOCTOR.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.196
[baby crying]

26:50.409 --> 26:54.914
[baby crying]

26:54.947 --> 26:56.182
- GO GET ME SOME ONION BROTH.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.917
YOU!

26:57.950 --> 26:59.819
GO TO THE HOTEL RESTAURANT,

26:59.852 --> 27:01.854
GET ME SOME ONION BROTH NOW.
GO!

27:01.888 --> 27:02.922
- WAS IT THE OLD MAN
OR THE BOY?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.791
- I DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.126
- CERTAIN YOU DON'T KNOW?
- TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.260
- WELL, I KNOW FOR CERTAIN
THERE'S A MAN LYING HERE

27:08.294 --> 27:09.929
WITH A BULLET IN HIM.

27:09.962 --> 27:10.963
- I JUST TOLD YOU
I AIN'T SEEN HIM.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.199
- WILL YOU TWO STOP IT?

27:13.232 --> 27:14.333
SHUT THAT BABY UP.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.203
- EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.805
HERE.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.372
- PROP HIM UP.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.008
GET HIM UP.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.310
- [groans]

27:24.343 --> 27:26.846
- DRINK THE MEDICINE.

27:34.086 --> 27:38.357
- [coughing]

27:38.390 --> 27:42.028
- YEAH, I CAN SMELL THE ONION
BROTH THROUGH THE WOUND.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.429
HE'S GUT-SHOT, ELAM.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.932
HE AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.967
[baby crying]

27:48.000 --> 27:49.969
- TAKE THAT DAMN BABY OUTSIDE.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.138
- NO, WAIT.

27:52.171 --> 27:56.108
BRING HER HERE.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.311
BRING HER OVER HERE.
PLEASE.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.380
LET ME SEE HER.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.283
PLEASE LET ME SEE HER.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.024
OH.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.325
[chuckles]

28:17.163 --> 28:22.134
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
MR. FERGUSON...

28:22.168 --> 28:25.037
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.938
- YOU WANTED IT.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.074
- NOT LIKE THIS.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.984
- WELL?

29:23.229 --> 29:25.297
ALL RIGHT.
TELEGRAPH THE FORT.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.366
TELL THE MAJOR WE NEED HELP
EVICTING THEM HOMESTEADERS.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.138
YOU WANT A RAILROAD STORY?

29:32.171 --> 29:34.773
FOLLOW ME.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.316
- MR. HATCH!

30:17.349 --> 30:22.088
THIS IS CULLEN BOHANNON
OF THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.323
I HAVE
A WRIT OF EXECUTION HERE

30:24.356 --> 30:27.994
FOR THE KILLING
OF MY CHIEF OF POLICE.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.562
COME ON OUT.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.137
YOU DON'T, AND THESE SOLDIERS
WILL BURN YOU OUT.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.571
I WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP THEM.

30:43.475 --> 30:46.412
YOU GOT ONE MINUTE,
MR. HATCH.

31:06.332 --> 31:10.636
- UNITED STATES CAVALRY
WAS NOT BUILT FOR WAITING.

31:10.669 --> 31:14.040
- WE DIDN'T COME HERE
TO KILL WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

31:14.073 --> 31:17.376
- A DISORGANIZED BRAIN
IS LACKING IN MORAL PRINCIPLES.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.378
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT,
BOHANNON?

31:19.411 --> 31:21.147
- NOT SOMETHING
I PONDER NIGHTS.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.648
- MORAL PRINCIPLES ARE
THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE

31:22.681 --> 31:25.384
AGAINST CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.619
- YOU LEARN
SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.388
- WITHOUT MORAL PRINCIPLES,

31:29.421 --> 31:31.423
THESE MORMONS WILL INEVITABLY
TURN TO VIOLENCE

31:31.457 --> 31:35.194
TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS,
JUST LIKE THE HEATHENS.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.297
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT,
CHIEF?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.499
- WHAT HE TALKING ABOUT?

31:59.118 --> 32:01.920
- Y'ALL KEEP
YOUR BARRELS DOWN.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.233
YOU AND YOUR BOYS
PUT YOUR GUNS DOWN.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.236
- I TOLD YOU,
STAY OFF MY PROPERTY,

32:17.269 --> 32:19.305
OR THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.107
- AND I TOLD YOU IF I COULDN'T
FIND A WAY AROUND,

32:21.140 --> 32:23.175
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD
RIGHTFULLY CLAIM ITS LAND.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.647
YOU MURDERED
MY CHIEF OF POLICE.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.117
- HE WAS TRESPASSING.
HE WAS WARNED.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.152
- YOU HAVE
TO STAND ACCOUNTABLE.

32:33.185 --> 32:36.188
- I AM THE PRIESTHOOD HOLDER
OF MY FAMILY, MR. BOHANNON.

32:36.222 --> 32:40.359
WITHOUT ME,
THEY WILL NOT SURVIVE.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.593
- YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT

32:41.627 --> 32:43.495
BEFORE YOU PULLED
THAT TRIGGER.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.232
- THEY WON'T SURVIVE.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.135
- I'LL SEE TO IT THEY GET

32:49.168 --> 32:50.536
TO THE MORMON SETTLEMENT
AT FORT SMITH.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.438
HOW'S THAT?

33:44.256 --> 33:46.525
- HE DONE IT.
- FATHER?

34:00.506 --> 34:03.209
- DID YOU KILL THAT MAN, SON?

34:03.242 --> 34:04.510
TELL ME THE TRUTH NOW.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.393
- YES, SIR.

34:23.295 --> 34:27.399
- MR. FERGUSON,
THIS BOY SHOOT DICK BARLOW?

34:29.768 --> 34:31.503
- I AIN'T SURE.

34:35.607 --> 34:38.644
- GOOD GOD, MAN,
GET ON WITH IT.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.280
- YOU'D HAVE ME HANG HIM?

34:41.313 --> 34:42.781
- IT'S THE LAW, BOHANNON.

34:42.814 --> 34:45.317
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF, AND YOU
ARE OBLIGED TO UPHOLD IT.

34:45.351 --> 34:49.255
WE DO NOT MAKE EXCEPTIONS
TO THE LAW OUT HERE.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.290
- YOU REALIZE HE'LL HANG.

34:51.323 --> 34:54.626
- HE'S JUST A BOY.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.562
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
THE TRUTH.

34:56.595 --> 34:57.829
- I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH!

34:57.863 --> 35:00.466
- SON, YOU GOT
A DIFFERENT STORY,

35:00.499 --> 35:02.100
YOU BEST TELL ME RIGHT NOW.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.741
- HE'S JUST A BOY.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.452
- NOT TODAY HE AIN'T.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.321
ALL RIGHT.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.527
- FATHER.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.329
- COME HERE.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.664
- FATHER!
- COME ON, BOY.

35:32.698 --> 35:35.667
COME ON.
EASY.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.606
- FATHER!

35:40.639 --> 35:42.441
FATHER!

35:42.474 --> 35:43.742
- SORRY, SON.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.687
[keys clacking]

36:28.720 --> 36:32.391
- "LIFE ON THE PRAIRIE IS
NOT WORTH THE POWDER IT TAKES

36:32.424 --> 36:35.427
TO BLOW IT ALL TO HELL."

36:42.434 --> 36:44.803
SO SAY THE DENIZENS
OF HELL ON WHEELS,

36:44.836 --> 36:46.472
THE ROLLICKING TENT CITY

36:46.505 --> 36:48.874
THAT MOVES WITH
THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD

36:48.907 --> 36:50.676
AS IT CREEPS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

36:50.709 --> 36:53.712
AT A PACE
OF TWO MILES PER DAY.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.647
IT IS NO PLACE
FOR WOMEN OR CHILDREN,

36:55.681 --> 36:57.516
AS THE MEN WHO LABOR HERE,

36:57.549 --> 37:02.388
VETERANS OF THE RECENT CONFLICT,
IMMIGRANTS, AND FREE NEGROES,

37:02.421 --> 37:04.623
OFTEN TAKE TO DRINK
AND UN-CHRISTIAN PURSUITS

37:04.656 --> 37:07.826
WHEN NOT SWINGING A HAMMER
OR LAYING TRACK.

37:07.859 --> 37:11.430
EVERY MAN HERE
CARRIES A GUN,

37:11.463 --> 37:14.600
WHICH CAN BE HAD
FOR AS LITTLE AS $3,

37:14.633 --> 37:17.969
AND A KNIFE
AND GOES TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.913
HERE YOU CAN BUY A MEAL
FOR 35 CENTS,

37:27.946 --> 37:30.416
A BEER
FOR LESS THAN A QUARTER,

37:30.449 --> 37:34.453
A SUIT OF CLOTHES FOR $5
THAT INCLUDES A HAT.

37:34.486 --> 37:37.456
THE BELONGINGS OF THE DEAD
ARE CHEAPER THAN THAT.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.258
- ANY LAST WORDS, SON?

37:43.462 --> 37:45.997
- I CAME HERE TO MEET THE MAN
WHO REPLACED DOC DURANT

37:46.031 --> 37:49.801
AS CHIEF ENGINEER
OF THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.937
I CAN TELL YOU HE IS A MAN

37:51.970 --> 37:54.873
FOR WHOM HONOR IS SACRED

37:54.906 --> 37:58.877
AND VIRTUE IMPERMANENT.

38:02.581 --> 38:05.584
IN THE BRAVE NEW WILDERNESS
HE CALLS HOME,

38:05.617 --> 38:08.620
INTEGRITY IS IMPORTANT
TO CULLEN BOHANNON.

39:14.553 --> 39:18.590
[horse neighs]

40:24.656 --> 40:26.825
WHETHER A MAN OF INTEGRITY
IS WHAT'S NEEDED

40:26.858 --> 40:30.629
TO BUILD THE RAILROAD,
WE DON'T YET KNOW.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.998
THE RAILROAD HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THE BUSINESS

40:33.031 --> 40:35.200
OF THE UNSCRUPULOUS
AND CORRUPT.

40:44.710 --> 40:47.646
- YOU OWE ME A LIFE

40:47.679 --> 40:50.181
FOR THE ONE
YOU TOOK FROM ME TODAY.

40:59.090 --> 41:02.894
- I SUSPECT OUR NEW CHIEF
ENGINEER TO BE NEITHER.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.012
AND FOR THAT, DEAR READER,

41:21.046 --> 41:23.949
WE MIGHT ALL
COUNT OUR BLESSINGS...

41:30.989 --> 41:33.692
AND SAY A PRAYER.
