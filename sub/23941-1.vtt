00:06.273 --> 00:08.007
As Victor Hugo wrote,

00:08.042 --> 00:10.843
"To love or have loved,
that is enough.

00:10.879 --> 00:12.712
Ask nothing further."

00:12.780 --> 00:15.080
In sum, ladies and gentlemen,

00:15.116 --> 00:18.250
the customs and manners
of the Regency period

00:18.285 --> 00:21.186
were exemplified and celebrated

00:21.222 --> 00:23.623
in Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

00:23.658 --> 00:26.626
Now it might seem quaint
and old-fashioned,

00:26.694 --> 00:31.196
but Jane Austen's world
was defined by civility.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.833
Social graces shaped society.

00:33.902 --> 00:36.802
And while you might not
think it's relevant,

00:36.838 --> 00:40.840
the lessons of gentility
and respect still have a place

00:40.875 --> 00:42.942
in the world today.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.444
Okay, well, that wraps it up
for this quarter.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.681
I expect to have
your final essays in my inbox

00:48.716 --> 00:50.683
at midnight tonight.

00:52.987 --> 00:56.121
Hey, Jazz, what's up?

00:57.692 --> 01:02.161
I'd love to, but I have plans.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.865
Yes, it's a date, a lunch date.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.967
Uh, well, I gotta go.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.169
Okay, take care.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.304
I was born
and raised here.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.473
Just been me and my dad.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.676
You know, it's funny.

01:16.711 --> 01:19.712
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to be like him:

01:19.781 --> 01:21.981
A roper, a rider.

01:22.050 --> 01:25.718
But then I grew up,
and I went away to college.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.453
Ta-da!

01:27.488 --> 01:30.189
Here I am, Assistant Professor
Kelly Pavlik,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.058
Montana State University,

01:32.093 --> 01:35.360
with an invitation
to lecture at Oxford next year,

01:35.396 --> 01:38.664
once I'm... done my doctorate.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.934
So, uh, you're a...

01:41.970 --> 01:43.402
You study a lot, right?

01:43.437 --> 01:46.005
Uh, that's one way
of putting it.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.841
Very cool. I read stuff.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.610
You do?

01:50.645 --> 01:52.912
Oh, yeah, big reader.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.681
Captain Fantastic.
Totally awesome.

01:55.717 --> 01:57.549
But not as much as Lizard Man.

01:57.619 --> 02:00.252
Lizard Man rocks.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.089
So you read comic books.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.124
Graphic novels.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.891
Yeah, but that's not...

02:05.960 --> 02:08.928
Touchdown! Yes! Come on!

02:08.963 --> 02:10.372
<i>The ball was thrown behind him.</i>

02:10.396 --> 02:11.964
Wow.

02:12.033 --> 02:13.499
That was really rude of me,

02:13.534 --> 02:15.567
and I'm sorry about that, Judy.

02:15.637 --> 02:17.503
I mean, I mean Kelly.

02:17.538 --> 02:21.073
Oh, sorry,
did you wanna watch too?

02:21.109 --> 02:23.308
<i>Off the left side
for three yards.</i>

02:25.146 --> 02:27.579
So there I was,
telling him my life story,

02:27.615 --> 02:29.649
and he didn't hear a word of it.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.283
Jerk.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.551
His loss.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.820
I thought so.

02:34.856 --> 02:36.756
Jasmine, you're my best friend.

02:36.791 --> 02:38.557
Tell me what it is
I'm doing wrong.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.926
How about stop dating losers?

02:40.962 --> 02:43.562
Well, they can't all be losers.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.164
Maybe I should just stop dating.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.167
Oh, come on. The way I see it

02:48.235 --> 02:51.370
is you spend your time
living in books,

02:51.405 --> 02:54.974
books that were written
when chivalry was still a thing.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.810
So? I miss chivalry.

02:57.879 --> 03:00.780
Kelly, the kind of guy
you're looking for

03:00.848 --> 03:02.581
doesn't exist anymore.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.827
There's gotta be
some guy out there

03:03.851 --> 03:06.451
that's a lot less Lizard Boy

03:06.487 --> 03:09.521
and a little bit more
Fitzwilliam Darcy.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.356
If you don't want
to spend your life

03:11.392 --> 03:13.859
being constantly disappointed,

03:13.928 --> 03:16.062
you're gonna have
to accept the fact

03:16.097 --> 03:18.064
that times have changed,

03:18.099 --> 03:20.833
and men have really changed.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.901
Never!

03:25.006 --> 03:26.438
Thanks for lunch.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.815
Ms. Kelly Pavlik,
daughter of Henry Pavlik?

03:35.883 --> 03:38.283
- Yes.
- Ah! Um...

03:39.420 --> 03:41.020
Grimsby's the name.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.355
I've been retained
to locate your father,

03:43.424 --> 03:45.758
regarding a matter
of great concern.

03:45.793 --> 03:49.328
You're looking for my dad,
Hank Pavlik?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.662
Indeed, I am.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.264
Are you sure
you have the right man?

03:52.299 --> 03:53.599
Oh, quite sure.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.068
It's vital that I speak with him

03:56.104 --> 03:59.404
in person, preferably,
as soon as possible.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.706
Is he in trouble?

04:00.775 --> 04:02.407
No, madam.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.909
But it's vital.

04:03.945 --> 04:06.278
Positively vital.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.914
All right, come on in.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.938 --> 04:32.471
It ain't there, neither.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.140
Well, now I'm beginning to think

04:34.208 --> 04:36.208
maybe it was actually
the filling station.

04:36.244 --> 04:38.811
You know the Big A,
where I parked my car at.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.813
So I hike on down there
and take a look-see,

04:40.848 --> 04:42.447
and what do you suppose I found?

04:42.483 --> 04:46.085
Nothing. It ain't there.
I was going nuts, and I...

04:46.154 --> 04:48.553
Looks like we got ourselves
company there, Zeke.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.591
I think I'll head on down there
and see who it is.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.626
Right in the middle of my story?
It ain't finished.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.062
Well, I reckon you can finish
your story by yourself.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.665
- Oh, and, Zeke.
- Yeah?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.133
You took the pickup to town.

05:01.169 --> 05:03.302
That's why you couldn't
find your car.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.271
Yeah, end of story.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.174
Believe me,
I've been there, son.

05:08.209 --> 05:09.408
Done that.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.143
Man!

05:11.212 --> 05:12.411
Come on, Bear.

05:14.916 --> 05:16.556
Whoever said,
"Money can't buy happiness,"

05:16.617 --> 05:18.684
forgot about puppies, Bear.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.030
Word to the wise.
This is a cattle ranch.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.564
You might wanna watch your step.

05:32.599 --> 05:35.400
A veritable minefield.
How delightful.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.604
Hello, princess.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.307
Dad.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.607
Been a while.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.143
Not that long.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.111
Well, long enough.

05:46.147 --> 05:48.513
So what brings you out here?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.850
Dad, this is Mr. Grimsby.
He's a solicitor.

05:50.885 --> 05:53.018
Solicitor, huh?

05:53.054 --> 05:54.553
What are you selling?

05:54.621 --> 05:55.921
I'm not selling anything.

05:55.957 --> 05:57.890
I trust you know
what a solicitor is.

05:57.925 --> 06:01.493
Yeah, I do. Person who solicits.

06:01.528 --> 06:05.364
Dad, Mr. Grimsby is an attorney.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.266
Oh.

06:07.301 --> 06:10.702
Well, like I said,
what can I do for you, Grimsby?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.071
I've been retained

06:12.139 --> 06:14.506
to bring you
some rather momentous news.

06:14.541 --> 06:18.077
Due to the passing
of a distant relative,

06:18.112 --> 06:21.413
you've inherited
a substantial estate...

06:21.482 --> 06:23.382
in Merania.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.017
Never heard of it.

06:25.086 --> 06:28.420
Central Europe, a principality
right next to Angosia.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.689
Merania, huh?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.657
What kind of a scam you running?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.494
I assure you, sir,
it is not a scam.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.863
Okay, well, how much could I get

06:37.899 --> 06:41.533
for this sizeable estate,
if I sold it?

06:41.568 --> 06:43.335
Why would you want to sell it?

06:43.371 --> 06:45.637
Well, I could use
a new pair of boots,

06:45.672 --> 06:48.507
and the good ones,
they don't come cheap.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.344
I'm afraid it's more complicated
than that, Mr. Pavlik.

06:52.380 --> 06:55.014
You see, there's a title
that comes with the property.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.783
And I'm supposed to be
impressed with a title?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.318
Dad, forget about the title.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.353
You just need to go
and sign some documents.

07:01.389 --> 07:03.188
In the presence of a judge.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.791
A judge in Merania, I presume.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.092
Yes, sir.

07:07.128 --> 07:08.593
I'll tell you what.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.562
I'll get back to you
on that, huh?

07:13.134 --> 07:14.499
Sir, I really must insist that...

07:14.568 --> 07:16.402
No, don't worry about him.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.070
This is what he does.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.238
I'll take care of it.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.575
Some people.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.878
You're stubborn, Dad,
you know that?

07:26.914 --> 07:30.615
Since Mom died,
this place is your only life.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.819
There's nothing wrong with that.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.755
Do you really think
this Grimsby guy's on the level?

07:36.824 --> 07:39.391
Oh, he showed me
six different databases

07:39.460 --> 07:41.760
that document genealogy.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.430
Your great-great-great
grandfather

07:44.465 --> 07:47.732
emigrated from Merania in 1793.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.768
He gave up everything
to marry someone

07:49.803 --> 07:51.337
his family didn't approve of.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.305
Hmm.

07:53.374 --> 07:55.507
Oh, come on, Dad.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.642
It wouldn't hurt to go
for a little bit.

07:57.678 --> 08:02.814
Everything I want is here.
I got my dog, I got you.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.584
I don't want nothing. I'm happy.

08:05.652 --> 08:11.423
Dad, I was offered a teaching
position at Oxford next year.

08:11.459 --> 08:13.192
What are you telling me?

08:13.227 --> 08:15.894
It's not permanent.
At first, anyway.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.197
I'd be a visiting lecturer.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.800
But I could be moving to England
for a while.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.103
You can't turn your back
on family like that.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.872
I mean, Boston was bad enough,
but England?

08:26.907 --> 08:29.741
I'm not turning my back
on anyone, Dad.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.244
Okay? I'm just
following my dreams.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.046
Things are different now.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.515
I never see you anymore,
unless I come to the ranch,

08:36.549 --> 08:38.116
and then when I do come,

08:38.152 --> 08:39.729
you don't even act
like you're interested

08:39.753 --> 08:41.686
- in anything I'm doing.
- That's not true.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.422
What else would you
want to talk about?

08:43.457 --> 08:45.224
There's so much
we could talk about.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.859
Yeah, well,
whatever happened to that girl

08:47.928 --> 08:52.031
who loves riding horses
and roping cattle?

08:52.066 --> 08:54.366
Yeah, maybe she grew up.

08:54.402 --> 08:58.137
Maybe she wanted to get out and
see new things and new places.

08:58.172 --> 08:59.738
See the world.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.508
So this place isn't
good enough for you, huh?

09:02.543 --> 09:05.610
Why? Because I don't read
fancy books

09:05.646 --> 09:07.746
or make the big money?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.248
I never said that.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.050
Well, that's what you meant.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.218
I guess I shouldn't
even be surprised.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.625
Okay.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.828
Okay, I'll go!

09:23.864 --> 09:25.497
Huh.

09:25.533 --> 09:27.566
But I'm gonna miss my dog.

09:29.470 --> 09:32.538
Yeah, I'm gonna miss your
bad breath a whole bunch, Bear.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.939
That's for sure.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.476
Ol' Hank loves his Bear dog.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.345
Oh, wow, somebody needs a bath.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.074
Look, Mom, John Wayne.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.342
Stop it!

10:10.377 --> 10:12.511
You made it!

10:12.546 --> 10:14.813
Excellent!
I have the car waiting.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.281
Oh.

10:16.317 --> 10:18.717
<i>Final boarding
for train 313,</i>

10:18.752 --> 10:20.652
<i>departing for Merania.</i>

10:25.959 --> 10:28.093
Wow! This is for us?

10:28.162 --> 10:29.672
Don't get all
worked up, princess.

10:29.696 --> 10:33.298
My old pickup's
more dependable than this rig.

10:33.334 --> 10:37.769
Let's just hope we don't have
to get out and push her.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.871
Right this way, sir.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.604
Come on.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.340
Come on.

11:15.376 --> 11:17.142
Come on.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.311
Come on.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.748
Hey, what are you doing?
You're scaring them.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.262
Would you mind moving
your sheep off the road?

11:25.286 --> 11:26.552
Yeah, no problem.

11:26.587 --> 11:28.019
Hyah! Come on, let's go!

11:28.055 --> 11:31.956
Oh, good grief.
Let me do this. Excuse me.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.393
Okay, little buddies, let's go!

11:34.428 --> 11:36.795
Move it along. Whoo-hoo!

11:36.830 --> 11:38.597
Hyah! Come on!

11:38.632 --> 11:39.864
That's my girl, Grimsby.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.371
It's good to see
she's still got it in her.

11:50.444 --> 11:51.910
Nice job.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.044
Thanks, Dad.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.581
Thank you! Later!

12:00.721 --> 12:02.221
This is it, sir.

12:02.256 --> 12:05.324
Your estate, up there.

12:05.359 --> 12:07.459
That's not an estate. That's a...

12:07.494 --> 12:08.694
A castle.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.463
We're gonna live in a castle?

12:11.532 --> 12:13.232
Vampires live in a castle.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.200
Dad!

12:58.379 --> 12:59.778
Thank you.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.848
Oh, wow.

13:05.286 --> 13:07.486
Bit like Montana.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.121
This looks nothing like Montana.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.925
Well, it's smelling
like Montana.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.260
What, am I wrong?

13:15.296 --> 13:16.995
This way, please.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.264
Welcome, Sire.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.565
Howdy.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.603
- Sir.
- How you doin' there?

13:24.638 --> 13:25.970
Nice to meet you.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.272
Thanks for having us.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.107
- Sir.
- Hello.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.742
- Much obliged.
- Welcome, Sire.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.545
I'd like you to meet
Miss Cecelia Petrov

13:33.580 --> 13:34.913
and Mr. Bosworth.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.182
They will be
your private secretary

13:37.217 --> 13:40.185
and gentleman's gentleman
while you are in residence.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.220
My what?

13:41.288 --> 13:43.522
Your butler, Your Majesty.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.990
What'd you call me?

13:46.059 --> 13:49.027
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.296
I'm sure you're eager
to see your property.

13:51.332 --> 13:53.965
- That would be lovely.
- This way, please.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.850
You wanna tell me
what's going on here?

14:11.918 --> 14:16.054
As I hope I made clear,
in addition to the estate, Sire,

14:16.089 --> 14:19.157
you've also inherited
the title that comes with it.

14:19.192 --> 14:23.895
And though very few actual
responsibilities are attached,

14:23.930 --> 14:26.832
there are a limited number
of ceremonial duties

14:26.867 --> 14:28.467
you'll be required to fulfill.

14:28.502 --> 14:30.101
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
the title.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.270
So what's the title?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.944
You're the King of Merania, Dad.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.827
You knew about this,
and you didn't say nothing?

14:43.851 --> 14:45.584
Would you be here if I did?

14:45.619 --> 14:48.720
Well, you know
the answer to that.

14:48.789 --> 14:51.055
Grimsby, can we have
a moment alone, please?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.123
Of course.

14:58.599 --> 14:59.865
I'm sorry.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.634
Boy, you better be.

15:02.703 --> 15:04.168
You want to tell me
what's so funny?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.537
Since I was little,

15:05.572 --> 15:07.372
you've always had
a nickname for me.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.574
- Really? Like what?
- Princess!

15:09.610 --> 15:11.576
You always called me Princess.

15:11.612 --> 15:14.546
And now I am, I guess,
but for real.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.015
I am not a king. I am a cowhand.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.517
And I don't belong here!

15:18.585 --> 15:20.419
Haven't you got sense
to see that?

15:20.454 --> 15:23.121
What I see is that you're not
even trying to make this work.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.957
I just got here,
and already I miss my dog.

15:25.992 --> 15:26.992
Oh, here we go.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.761
You asked me to go on this trip,

15:29.797 --> 15:30.962
and I did,

15:31.031 --> 15:32.263
and now I'm going home,

15:32.299 --> 15:34.198
as soon as I can find
this guy Grimsby

15:34.234 --> 15:37.035
to tell him I'm quitting
and going to Montana.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.103
It's called abdicating, Dad.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.271
And before you do it,

15:40.307 --> 15:43.708
there is something
you should know.

15:43.744 --> 15:47.746
This is where we are, Merania.

15:47.781 --> 15:52.350
We share a border here
with Angosia.

15:53.754 --> 15:55.854
Centuries ago,
both countries were one,

15:55.889 --> 15:58.657
ruled by a king,
who had twin sons.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.259
He couldn't choose
a successor between them,

16:01.294 --> 16:04.062
so he split Angosia in half.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.298
One got Angosia,
and the other one got Merania.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.367
So what's any of this
got to do with me?

16:09.402 --> 16:12.403
The division remains
as long as there's a king

16:12.473 --> 16:14.172
on the Meranian throne.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.107
That's why they were
so desperate to find you.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.742
When the last king died,

16:17.778 --> 16:19.778
you were the only
living male heir.

16:19.847 --> 16:21.880
So if you abdicate,

16:21.915 --> 16:24.950
the country would lose
its independence.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.886
Merania would then be ruled
by King Nikolas of Angosia.

16:27.921 --> 16:31.155
Look, I'm sorry
for your trouble, I am,

16:31.191 --> 16:33.024
but you got the wrong guy.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.627
My daddy was a ranchman,
and so was his daddy.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.831
That's all we've ever been
is cattlemen and horseshoers.

16:39.867 --> 16:42.968
So we'll be leaving
first thing in the morning.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.445
Dad? Dad, stop.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.982
I know how you love your books
and your stories.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.217
Well, that's all you got here,
just another story.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.652
Don't you get it?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.621
Your roots, my roots,
they're here.

17:02.656 --> 17:04.321
These people need you now.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.558
You don't know anything
about these people.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.871
I know that they want
their independence.

17:07.895 --> 17:09.528
Well, so do I.

17:11.565 --> 17:14.165
Oh, she's a feisty one, sir.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.634
Can I get you anything, sir?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.268
Fresh air. I'm going for a walk.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.637
- Excellent idea.
- Alone, Bosworth.

17:19.673 --> 17:22.106
Oh, as you wish, sir.

17:25.746 --> 17:29.480
I hope it's to your liking,
Your Grace.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.416
I don't like it.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.384
I love it.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.489
But I don't know
how long I'll be staying.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.759
Is your father really leaving?

17:40.794 --> 17:42.827
I don't know.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.729
That's what he says.

17:44.765 --> 17:47.398
If I can speak plainly,

17:47.434 --> 17:50.035
it's so very important
to all of us here

17:50.103 --> 17:51.803
to get him to change his mind.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.204
I'm gonna try.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.839
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

17:54.875 --> 17:55.875
Thanks.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.175
Uh, Cece.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.710
Yes?

17:58.779 --> 18:01.846
I want to do research on
Merania and the people here.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.715
Is there a library in town?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.751
Of course, but I think
you'll find the palace library

18:06.820 --> 18:08.720
more to your liking.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.430
<i>♪♪ </i>

18:29.009 --> 18:30.842
Well!

18:30.877 --> 18:32.577
Hello, girls!

18:32.613 --> 18:34.112
Ha!

18:45.892 --> 18:50.061
<i>♪♪ </i>

18:56.302 --> 18:57.302
Careful!

19:04.177 --> 19:05.177
Thank you.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.849
Hey, I know you.
You're the shepherd guy.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.151
Also the cow guy, the horse guy,

19:13.186 --> 19:14.786
and the all-around
royal stable guy.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.188
I even have a name. I'm Alex.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.389
I'm Kelly.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.559
Yeah, Princess Kelly. I heard.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.061
Kelly is fine.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.898
So what brings
a shepherd guy, cow guy,

19:26.933 --> 19:31.335
and all-around
royal stable guy to a library?

19:31.371 --> 19:34.305
Well, I was just
returning these.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.340
Before King Viktor
died last year,

19:36.409 --> 19:38.743
he allowed me to borrow
anything I wanted.

19:38.779 --> 19:41.112
Since then, I wasn't sure
I would still be allowed.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.580
I'm sure it's okay.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.916
So you're not gonna
send me to the dungeon?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.617
Not today.

19:46.653 --> 19:50.855
So, looks like you're
reading some poetry.

19:50.891 --> 19:52.356
"Words, like nature,

19:52.392 --> 19:55.727
half reveal and half conceal
the soul within."

19:55.762 --> 19:58.730
Tennyson. Okay.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.332
It's not what I would expect
from a stable boy.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.969
I can also quote a fair amount
of Dr. Seuss, though, sadly,

20:05.005 --> 20:06.749
it doesn't impress anyone
over the age of six.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.440
I'm more of
a Jane Austen fan myself.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.943
Austen. That's not
what I would've expected

20:11.978 --> 20:13.778
from a Montana ranch hand.

20:13.814 --> 20:16.214
I am not a ranch hand.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.516
Whatever you say.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.188
I don't need you
to carry my books.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.289
But you're a royal princess,

20:25.325 --> 20:27.291
not a common stable boy like me.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.327
I didn't mean
horsemen were common,

20:29.362 --> 20:31.196
just a little rough
around the edges.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.297
Ah, and you don't like
rough edges?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.266
Yeah, I think I will
carry my own books,

20:35.301 --> 20:36.701
thank you very much.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.703
So what are you planning
on doing with these?

20:38.739 --> 20:40.205
Well, if you must know,

20:40.240 --> 20:42.774
I am researching
local history and culture.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.710
Ah, well, lucky for you,
I'm an expert in both.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.879
I can show you
or take you on a tour

20:47.914 --> 20:49.981
to see some of the local
landmarks, if you like.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.950
Saddle up a couple of horses,
ride out to...

20:51.985 --> 20:54.418
No, no, no.
I haven't ridden in years.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.187
Really? Why not?

20:56.223 --> 20:58.189
It's complicated.

20:58.225 --> 21:00.024
Well, I'm sure I can keep up.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.393
All right. When I was a kid,

21:02.428 --> 21:05.263
my father pushed me
to become a ranch girl.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.575
I rode in competitions,
barrel racing,

21:06.599 --> 21:07.999
that kind of thing.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.034
And then I just wanted
something of my own,

21:10.103 --> 21:12.670
so I quit and never rode again.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.305
And I bet your dad
didn't like that.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.207
I don't think
he's ever forgiven me.

21:16.243 --> 21:19.477
He doesn't have to know.
I'm sure you're pretty rusty.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.679
- Guess again.
- Care to prove it?

21:21.748 --> 21:24.082
I don't have to prove myself
to you or anyone.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.583
Of course you don't.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.351
But you don't want
to humiliate yourself.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.121
I'm sure it was
a long, long time ago.

21:30.157 --> 21:31.322
Not that long.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.657
Look, forget I said anything.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.558
Already forgotten.

21:34.594 --> 21:38.663
I mean, we wouldn't want you
to strain anything royal.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.534
So you coming?

21:53.379 --> 21:55.413
Books can be
a wonderful gift,

21:55.481 --> 21:57.715
but a ride through nature
cures all.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.885
This is... Wow.

22:00.921 --> 22:03.721
Jane Austen couldn't have
put it more eloquently.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.356
It's beautiful.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.025
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

22:07.060 --> 22:08.993
We have incredible
natural resources here.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.229
Lumber, ore.

22:11.264 --> 22:13.764
Those mountains are filled
with copper and tin

22:13.834 --> 22:16.167
and a rare earth
used in computers.

22:16.203 --> 22:18.102
It's like a postcard.

22:18.138 --> 22:20.071
It is.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.540
We were worried when King
Nikolas was gonna take over,

22:22.575 --> 22:24.542
that things would change.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.144
Change how?

22:26.179 --> 22:29.613
King Nikolas likes to
modernize and industrialize.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.717
But now your dad's here,
we got nothing to worry about.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.386
Well, my dad's here now.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.122
I just need to
convince him to stay.

22:38.158 --> 22:39.557
Why? Is there a problem?

22:39.592 --> 22:42.660
Well, the truth is,

22:42.695 --> 22:46.831
he doesn't feel like
he belongs here.

22:46.867 --> 22:49.133
There's something
I need to show you.

22:58.172 --> 23:01.874
Dad, we need to talk.

23:01.909 --> 23:03.409
What are you doing?

23:03.478 --> 23:05.111
Gate needed fixing.

23:05.146 --> 23:08.047
Well, what do you care,
if you're leaving tomorrow?

23:08.082 --> 23:10.282
Something's broke, you fix it.

23:10.351 --> 23:11.550
That's right.

23:11.585 --> 23:13.052
- Come with me.
- Hmm?

23:13.121 --> 23:14.453
Come on.

23:17.625 --> 23:20.059
These people here
have a real problem, Dad,

23:20.094 --> 23:24.263
and it needs to be fixed,
just like that gate out there.

23:24.298 --> 23:26.399
You can't fix everything
for everybody.

23:26.434 --> 23:28.467
What is it that you always say?

23:28.536 --> 23:30.202
You never turn your back
on family.

23:30.238 --> 23:31.737
I'm not turning my back on...

23:31.805 --> 23:36.308
Meet King Henry the Brave,
first king of Merania.

23:36.344 --> 23:38.577
And don't you dare tell me
he doesn't look like

23:38.612 --> 23:40.146
part of our family.

23:40.181 --> 23:41.713
Hmm.

23:41.782 --> 23:43.516
Look, you don't need
to stay here long,

23:43.584 --> 23:45.717
but long enough
to knock some sense

23:45.753 --> 23:49.088
into King Nikolas of Angosia.

23:50.824 --> 23:51.890
What?

23:51.959 --> 23:53.792
Two weeks.

23:53.827 --> 23:56.062
Once it's done, I'm gone.

23:58.699 --> 24:00.366
Good morning, Your Majesty.

24:00.401 --> 24:02.868
Yes, your first
appointment today

24:02.937 --> 24:05.871
is with Mr. Grimsby, a briefing.

24:05.906 --> 24:07.273
What kind of briefing?

24:07.308 --> 24:08.628
I believe it concerns
your address

24:08.676 --> 24:10.709
to the Parliament Privy Council.

24:10.778 --> 24:11.778
What's that?

24:11.812 --> 24:13.245
The group of elected ministers

24:13.281 --> 24:15.747
who tend to government affairs.

24:15.783 --> 24:16.949
Anything else?

24:17.017 --> 24:21.620
No, no. Thanks, Boz.

24:21.655 --> 24:24.457
How wonderful. A nickname.

24:24.492 --> 24:26.092
King Viktor
was a good man,

24:26.127 --> 24:28.160
but he didn't know
the first thing about farming.

24:28.196 --> 24:30.129
You know, I wanted you
to know I can do more.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.641
You just say the word,
and I'll be there.

24:31.665 --> 24:33.499
Well, I appreciate that.

24:33.568 --> 24:34.866
Oh, nice chair.

24:34.902 --> 24:36.835
But where do they put the couch?

24:36.870 --> 24:39.071
Ha! Yes.

24:39.140 --> 24:42.074
Alex was telling me he'd like
to increase the number of sheep.

24:42.110 --> 24:45.344
Yes, well, very good.
First things first.

24:45.379 --> 24:47.813
Your daughter's told me
you're on board

24:47.848 --> 24:49.615
and ready to
get down to business.

24:49.650 --> 24:52.718
Wait a minute.
What exactly does that mean?

24:52.753 --> 24:55.721
Well, I had a great idea, Dad,
and Grimsby agrees.

24:55.756 --> 24:58.157
I invited
King Nikolas of Angosia

24:58.192 --> 24:59.858
to pay us an official visit.

24:59.927 --> 25:03.729
You'll be hosting him
at a state dinner this evening.

25:03.764 --> 25:06.565
Well, then how about
we make it a barbecue?

25:06.634 --> 25:08.066
- No!
- No!

25:08.136 --> 25:10.436
Okay, so that's it?

25:10.471 --> 25:13.839
And we've prepared
a small guest list.

25:13.874 --> 25:15.741
Is there anyone
you'd like to include?

25:15.809 --> 25:17.676
Mm...

25:17.711 --> 25:19.077
Just my dog.

25:20.648 --> 25:22.948
This afternoon,
you will make an appearance

25:23.017 --> 25:24.716
with the Parliament
Privy Council.

25:24.752 --> 25:28.354
Then we have the royal games,
followed by the royal ball.

25:28.422 --> 25:30.088
Royal pain is what it is.

25:30.124 --> 25:32.691
You know why a dog
is man's best friend?

25:32.726 --> 25:34.760
Because he wags his tail
instead of his tongue.

25:34.828 --> 25:36.228
Stop it.

25:36.297 --> 25:38.597
Don't encourage him.

25:38.633 --> 25:40.098
I didn't do anything.

25:40.134 --> 25:42.901
Look, Grimsby, about the meeting
this afternoon,

25:42.936 --> 25:45.137
- I'm not sure I'm...
- Prepared?

25:45.173 --> 25:46.872
Of course not. How could you be?

25:46.940 --> 25:49.275
- Oh, good, then you'll...
- Write your remarks?

25:49.310 --> 25:51.777
Already done.

25:51.845 --> 25:54.513
I've worked hard
to strike the proper tone.

25:54.549 --> 25:57.916
Do try to read it as written.

25:57.951 --> 26:00.686
The council doesn't care much
for surprises.

26:00.721 --> 26:02.421
Hmm.

26:03.757 --> 26:05.491
We'll get out of your way,

26:05.526 --> 26:08.627
give you time to prepare.

26:08.663 --> 26:10.962
I told you not to encourage him.

26:11.031 --> 26:13.098
- I'm not.
- Why are you kissing up to him?

26:13.133 --> 26:14.300
I wasn't.

26:14.335 --> 26:17.336
Look, we're just
kindred spirits.

26:17.405 --> 26:20.105
You know, he needs
to behave like a king.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.574
And you worry too much.

26:21.609 --> 26:23.053
Now you're starting
to sound just like him.

26:23.077 --> 26:24.677
And is that so bad?

26:24.712 --> 26:26.579
Yes.

26:33.153 --> 26:35.987
<i>♪♪ </i>

26:37.725 --> 26:39.358
Off with their heads!

26:45.466 --> 26:49.268
- Uh, sir, sir.
- Hmm?

26:49.337 --> 26:52.638
I'm afraid the west wing
has been avoided for years.

26:52.673 --> 26:54.573
Would you like me
to kick the door in?

26:54.609 --> 26:56.442
I've seen it done
in American action movies.

26:56.477 --> 26:57.610
It looks rather exciting.

26:57.645 --> 26:58.877
No, I appreciate the offer.

26:58.912 --> 27:00.412
I'm just snooping around.

27:00.481 --> 27:02.548
Oh, well, feel free
to snoop, Sire.

27:02.617 --> 27:06.318
Yeah, can you tell me why
it's all closed off like that?

27:06.387 --> 27:08.086
Yes. Cost-cutting.

27:08.122 --> 27:09.888
The monarchy
lacks the necessary funds

27:09.923 --> 27:11.390
to maintain the property,

27:11.459 --> 27:13.024
so it's rather dank down there.

27:13.093 --> 27:14.993
So I guess that explains
all the repair

27:15.062 --> 27:16.629
that needs doing around here.

27:16.697 --> 27:18.597
Not to worry.
The Parliament Privy Council

27:18.666 --> 27:21.166
expects to raise all the taxes
to cover the expense.

27:21.201 --> 27:22.601
It's all in your speech.

27:22.637 --> 27:24.737
Doesn't seem fair,
folks having to pay

27:24.772 --> 27:26.605
for a house
they don't even live in.

27:26.641 --> 27:29.341
Why, it's the way it's been
done for centuries, sir.

27:29.377 --> 27:32.210
Tell me, Boz, that grassland
behind the castle,

27:32.280 --> 27:33.646
do we own all that?

27:33.681 --> 27:35.046
Oh, yes, does indeed,

27:35.082 --> 27:36.782
all the way to the base
of the mountains.

27:36.850 --> 27:37.883
Hmm.

27:42.657 --> 27:46.692
- Good luck with your meeting!
- Piece of cake.

27:46.727 --> 27:49.328
Just please don't
start a revolution.

28:06.113 --> 28:08.380
In you go, come on.

28:08.416 --> 28:10.048
Come on, around you go.

28:11.519 --> 28:13.885
- There you go.
- What's her name?

28:16.156 --> 28:17.690
This is Nellie.

28:17.725 --> 28:20.826
She's expecting, isn't she?

28:22.930 --> 28:27.232
That's not bad for someone
who's not a cowgirl anymore.

28:27.301 --> 28:29.535
Hey, if you give her
one of these,

28:29.603 --> 28:30.902
she'll be your friend for life.

28:36.043 --> 28:40.346
So, um, I'm just gonna say it.

28:40.414 --> 28:45.584
I'm sorry for the thing
yesterday.

28:45.653 --> 28:48.454
What thing?

28:48.489 --> 28:50.589
Just being, uh, swotty.

28:50.624 --> 28:52.358
I'm sorry.

28:52.393 --> 28:55.961
I'm just not usually such a...

28:55.996 --> 28:57.429
Princess?

29:00.234 --> 29:01.867
Oh, no.

29:01.902 --> 29:04.470
King Nikolas is here,
and he's early,

29:04.505 --> 29:06.137
and I am not ready.

29:34.017 --> 29:35.083
King Nikolas.

29:43.827 --> 29:45.927
You must be Princess Kelly.

29:45.962 --> 29:49.998
Your Grace, may I present
King Nikolas of Angosia.

29:50.033 --> 29:51.400
It's so nice to meet you.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.102
I'm sorry.

29:54.137 --> 29:57.639
I didn't expect to... I thought...

29:57.708 --> 30:01.176
I hope you're not disappointed.

30:01.212 --> 30:02.944
No, Your Majesty.

30:02.979 --> 30:04.179
So I meet with your approval?

30:04.248 --> 30:07.282
Yes, Your Majesty.

30:07.318 --> 30:09.585
Oh, please, Your Majesty
was my father, and I'm Nikolas.

30:09.653 --> 30:13.255
And I clearly don't know
what I'm doing.

30:13.290 --> 30:15.257
Neither do I, most of the time.

30:15.292 --> 30:16.592
Um...

30:21.998 --> 30:24.099
I'm sorry. I didn't have
a chance to change

30:24.134 --> 30:25.701
before you got here.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.403
Oh, you look perfectly
fetching in straw.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.674
I'm sure you'd love
to go to your room,

30:32.710 --> 30:34.243
freshen up, relax.

30:34.278 --> 30:35.210
Sounds brilliant.

30:35.246 --> 30:36.845
I'll show you the way.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.048
We have tea
in the drawing room at three.

30:40.117 --> 30:41.850
Well, until then.

30:53.930 --> 30:55.930
Lords and ladies,

30:55.966 --> 30:58.133
may I present to you.

30:58.168 --> 31:02.271
His Royal Majesty,
King Henry of Merania.

31:12.816 --> 31:14.516
Here's the deal, fellas.

31:14.551 --> 31:20.021
I'm supposed to stand up here
and pretend to make nice

31:20.090 --> 31:23.958
so that you don't mind
when I ask you to raise taxes,

31:24.027 --> 31:26.795
so I can do repairs
and pay some bills

31:26.830 --> 31:29.331
on that castle up there.

31:29.366 --> 31:32.133
Well, to me,
that just don't seem fair.

31:32.169 --> 31:35.103
I was raised to pay my own way.

31:38.609 --> 31:40.809
Okay, here's my idea.

31:40.844 --> 31:44.078
You get me a few head of cattle,

31:44.114 --> 31:46.515
and I'll turn this royal spread

31:46.550 --> 31:48.817
into a real working
cattle ranch.

31:48.852 --> 31:52.354
It's not gonna be a problem
to turn a profit pretty quick.

31:53.757 --> 31:55.524
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Your Majesty,

31:55.559 --> 32:00.562
but wouldn't it be less work
to simply raise the taxes?

32:00.597 --> 32:04.165
Uh, less work ain't the point.

32:04.201 --> 32:08.437
And who would oversee
such an operation?

32:08.472 --> 32:09.838
You're looking at him.

32:09.906 --> 32:12.541
Well, an admirable plan,
Your Majesty,

32:12.576 --> 32:16.211
but we will still need
to do a study.

32:16.279 --> 32:18.246
Let me put this another way.

32:18.281 --> 32:22.116
You can either give me
a few head of cattle,

32:22.185 --> 32:24.986
or I head back to Montana,

32:25.021 --> 32:28.289
and you all can start learning
how to speak Angosian.

32:28.325 --> 32:29.825
Your choice.

32:32.162 --> 32:34.062
Very well.

32:34.130 --> 32:40.268
Then all in favor
of establishing a royal spread,

32:40.303 --> 32:41.570
say aye.

32:41.605 --> 32:43.238
Aye!

32:51.248 --> 32:52.248
Come in.

32:54.451 --> 32:55.784
You wanted to see me?

32:55.819 --> 32:58.720
- Yes, I have an emergency.
- Oh!

32:58.756 --> 33:01.089
Not an emergency-emergency.

33:01.157 --> 33:03.725
It's a wardrobe emergency.

33:03.794 --> 33:05.427
You see, I brought
some things with me,

33:05.462 --> 33:06.895
but nothing I could really wear

33:06.930 --> 33:09.264
to the state dinner
or the royal ball,

33:09.299 --> 33:13.134
and I really want to make
an impression on King Nikolas.

33:13.169 --> 33:15.336
I took the liberty

33:15.406 --> 33:18.907
of reaching out
to our couturier.

33:18.942 --> 33:20.742
Cece, you are a total genius.

33:20.811 --> 33:24.012
It's a special occasion.
Follow me.

33:30.721 --> 33:32.487
Do you think I could...

33:32.523 --> 33:34.890
Of course you can.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.066
I think this one is good
for the state dinner,

33:45.101 --> 33:49.504
but I don't know that there's
one for the royal ball.

33:49.540 --> 33:52.340
Oh, there is one more.

34:06.222 --> 34:09.023
Well, I feel like celebrating.

34:09.059 --> 34:12.494
What would you say to us
grabbing a nice cold beer?

34:12.529 --> 34:13.762
Cold, you say?

34:13.797 --> 34:15.597
Mm-mm.

34:15.632 --> 34:19.935
With your permission, Sire,
we'll wait in the car.

34:19.969 --> 34:22.070
Okay.

34:27.511 --> 34:30.110
I was hoping for a cold beer.

34:30.146 --> 34:31.480
Keep hoping.

34:31.514 --> 34:33.648
Let me know if it
gets any colder.

34:33.717 --> 34:36.317
You're not from around here.

34:36.353 --> 34:38.386
You think?

34:38.455 --> 34:40.420
You're a local?

34:40.456 --> 34:43.592
Montana. Originally, Abilene.

34:43.627 --> 34:45.694
Sorry, the refrigerated keg
isn't working.

34:45.728 --> 34:47.963
Can't get a repairman
to show up.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.899
I'm pretty good
at fixing things.

34:50.934 --> 34:52.065
Maybe I can help.

35:02.946 --> 35:05.580
So how'd you end up
so far away from home?

35:05.649 --> 35:09.283
I like castles,
so I came to see some.

35:09.319 --> 35:10.485
Next thing you know,

35:10.554 --> 35:13.354
I met a guy,
and we started a family.

35:13.390 --> 35:14.556
And never left.

35:14.591 --> 35:16.124
You talking about me or the guy?

35:16.159 --> 35:17.759
'Cause he's long gone.

35:17.794 --> 35:19.772
And the kids are all back
in the States for school.

35:19.796 --> 35:21.295
So what's keeping you here?

35:21.364 --> 35:23.565
I've been wondering that myself.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.634
There's talk we might all
become part of Angosia.

35:25.669 --> 35:27.035
And if that doesn't happen,

35:27.103 --> 35:28.670
we've gotta deal
with some whack job

35:28.739 --> 35:30.906
who thinks he's a king.

35:30.941 --> 35:32.440
A whack job, huh?

35:32.509 --> 35:34.876
Certifiable is the word.

35:34.912 --> 35:37.045
Your Majesty!

35:37.113 --> 35:39.147
Your Majesty?

35:39.215 --> 35:40.749
Boy, are you in the wrong place.

35:40.784 --> 35:42.918
Right here, Boz.

35:42.986 --> 35:45.720
And it's Hank,
certifiable as can be.

35:45.789 --> 35:47.455
We must leave now

35:47.490 --> 35:50.058
if you don't wish to be late
for the state dinner.

35:50.093 --> 35:51.860
Looks like I gotta run,

35:51.895 --> 35:54.796
but your tap ought
to work fine now,

35:54.831 --> 35:57.766
cool down real good.

35:57.801 --> 36:00.301
Shame about that fancy dinner,
Montana.

36:00.370 --> 36:03.071
I was just thinking about
asking you to stay for supper.

36:03.139 --> 36:04.806
I'll take a rain check on that.

36:04.841 --> 36:08.643
And the name's Joan,
in case you're interested.

36:09.913 --> 36:11.245
Joan.

36:21.421 --> 36:23.711
Yeah, that's fine.
Okay, take it.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.507
You better deal with it.

36:27.976 --> 36:30.444
Uh, I am so, so sorry.

36:30.479 --> 36:33.880
We're trying to close a deal
on a manufacturing contract.

36:33.915 --> 36:36.750
Electronics, communications,
they're the future for Angosia.

36:36.785 --> 36:39.453
Oh, you don't need
to apologize to me.

36:39.522 --> 36:42.156
You're the king,
for heaven's sake.

36:42.191 --> 36:46.593
Who is honored by your presence
and humbled by your beauty.

36:48.697 --> 36:52.032
I hope you're enjoying the tea.

36:52.067 --> 36:55.536
It's splendid, but then again,
Meranians are famed

36:55.604 --> 36:56.814
for their gracious hospitality.

36:56.838 --> 36:58.305
Yes, they are.

36:58.374 --> 37:02.676
I mean, we are,
since I'm a part of they.

37:02.711 --> 37:05.011
That means I'm we...

37:05.080 --> 37:07.214
I'm sorry.
I'm still so new to this.

37:07.249 --> 37:08.515
Yeah.

37:08.551 --> 37:10.184
You're a natural.

37:10.219 --> 37:12.553
Thank you for saying that.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.421
Well, it's true.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.726
So, um, when do I get
to meet His Royal Highness,

37:19.761 --> 37:21.361
your father, the king?

37:21.397 --> 37:23.930
He's at a meeting
with the Privy Council,

37:23.965 --> 37:26.533
but he should be back soon.

37:26.569 --> 37:29.903
So perhaps before
the state dinner this evening?

37:29.938 --> 37:32.105
Yes, yes.

37:32.140 --> 37:36.943
Yes, perhaps, but, uh...

37:36.978 --> 37:39.045
- Every eight feet!
- Put that pole there!

37:40.148 --> 37:41.848
But not likely.

37:41.883 --> 37:43.483
The king's schedule is full,

37:43.519 --> 37:45.985
as most kings' schedules are.

37:46.054 --> 37:48.322
I don't need to tell you that.
But he is looking forward

37:48.357 --> 37:51.758
to, uh... the dinner tonight.

37:51.793 --> 37:54.561
Which reminds me,
I have many things

37:54.597 --> 37:56.029
that I need to do beforehand,

37:56.064 --> 37:58.699
and I am rambling.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.800
It's perfectly charming.

38:00.836 --> 38:02.336
So until then.

38:02.404 --> 38:04.471
Until then, it is.

38:07.443 --> 38:09.209
All right, we need to get
that pole there.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.544
Dad?

38:10.613 --> 38:12.446
There.

38:12.481 --> 38:13.747
What are you doing?

38:13.782 --> 38:15.415
I got this whole field
to fence in.

38:15.451 --> 38:17.917
- We got a lot of cattle coming.
- You're a royal now.

38:17.986 --> 38:19.453
You need to start
behaving like one.

38:19.488 --> 38:21.355
- King Nikolas is here.
- All right.

38:21.423 --> 38:23.490
We need a corner there,
every 10 feet.

38:23.559 --> 38:25.024
And he's asking for you.

38:25.060 --> 38:26.671
You need to clean up,
change and get ready

38:26.695 --> 38:27.695
for the dinner tonight.

38:27.730 --> 38:29.429
Okay, I'll be there.

38:29.465 --> 38:31.398
Now get the barbed wire
and the Cumalong.

38:31.433 --> 38:32.832
Let's come down here and work.

38:32.901 --> 38:36.169
Hey, princess.
How was King Nikolas?

38:36.204 --> 38:39.339
Handsome, refined, polished.

38:39.375 --> 38:42.409
Oh, yeah? So none of those
annoying rough edges.

38:42.444 --> 38:44.110
Hmm, none of them.

38:44.179 --> 38:47.681
So Nellie was disappointed
you had to run off so soon.

38:47.716 --> 38:50.751
Well, maybe I'll come see her
after the dinner tonight.

38:50.786 --> 38:53.287
I don't know. She's got
a pretty busy schedule.

38:53.355 --> 38:55.522
Well, I can get her
a carrot from the kitchen.

38:55.557 --> 38:57.724
Now you're talking.

38:57.793 --> 39:01.094
Hey, Kelly, just be careful.

39:01.129 --> 39:02.562
What's that supposed to mean?

39:02.598 --> 39:05.632
King Nikolas is charming,
and he's a king.

39:05.668 --> 39:08.669
From what I've seen,
he always gets what he wants.

39:08.704 --> 39:10.604
Well, what makes you think
he wants me?

39:11.973 --> 39:13.940
I was talking politics.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.311
- I knew that.
- Yeah.

39:17.346 --> 39:19.078
Yeah.

39:25.487 --> 39:31.224
I, uh, want to welcome
our guests from Angosia

39:31.259 --> 39:33.927
and give blessing to this feast.

39:37.766 --> 39:40.367
Good bread, good meat.

39:40.402 --> 39:43.503
Good Lord, let's eat.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.813
Nobody's eating.

39:52.848 --> 39:55.148
Pick up your fork.

39:55.183 --> 39:57.484
Hmm? Oh.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.625
Well, I'm glad
you could join us, Nik.

40:05.661 --> 40:07.994
Thank you, Your Majesty.

40:11.667 --> 40:14.200
I really admire your father.

40:14.269 --> 40:17.971
He's a man of the, um, people.

40:18.039 --> 40:19.039
That, he is.

40:21.076 --> 40:24.711
Must've come as some surprise
to him to be king,

40:24.747 --> 40:25.979
as it did to us.

40:26.014 --> 40:27.581
A good surprise, I hope.

40:27.616 --> 40:29.282
Excuse me?

40:29.351 --> 40:32.786
Well, if Grimsby
hadn't located my dad,

40:32.821 --> 40:36.623
you would be the king of Merania
as well as Angosia.

40:36.658 --> 40:39.693
I hope you're not
too disappointed.

40:39.728 --> 40:41.995
Well, to be quite frank
with you, I'm relieved.

40:42.030 --> 40:45.832
If your father hadn't shown up,
then I wouldn't have met you.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.268
And that would've been
greatly disappointing.

41:00.949 --> 41:02.449
Escargot, sir.

41:04.252 --> 41:07.687
Fresh garden snails.

41:17.032 --> 41:18.865
Hey, there.

41:18.901 --> 41:21.167
I thought you had
a state dinner.

41:21.202 --> 41:24.103
Did I hear you say
something about supper?

41:24.139 --> 41:25.139
You did.

41:30.446 --> 41:33.480
Pastrav somonat.

41:33.549 --> 41:36.015
- Rainbow trout to you and me.
- Mmm!

41:36.051 --> 41:37.651
Fresh catch of the day.

41:37.686 --> 41:39.619
- Mm!
- Fit for a king?

41:39.655 --> 41:41.788
Mmm! Only way this fish
would be fresher

41:41.824 --> 41:43.723
is if I caught it myself.

41:43.759 --> 41:46.426
Then you're gonna have to come
fly fishing with me sometime.

41:46.495 --> 41:48.795
Oh?

41:48.831 --> 41:51.164
I'd like that.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.506
So I hear you're a scholar.

41:59.541 --> 42:03.209
I have my master's
in English literature.

42:03.244 --> 42:05.612
Which means you're smart
as well as beautiful.

42:05.647 --> 42:07.547
I don't know about that.

42:07.616 --> 42:11.017
I'm trying to get my doctorate.

42:11.052 --> 42:13.620
So what does the budding doctor,

42:13.689 --> 42:15.221
Princess Kelly of Merania,

42:15.256 --> 42:16.957
like to do in her free time?

42:16.992 --> 42:18.792
I like to read,

42:18.827 --> 42:21.461
the Regency period, most of all,

42:21.497 --> 42:25.064
because they had a certain,
um, civility back then

42:25.100 --> 42:27.266
that I appreciate.

42:27.302 --> 42:29.936
Good manners greases
the wheels of society.

42:29.972 --> 42:32.305
That is so true.

42:32.374 --> 42:34.173
Though, back then,

42:34.209 --> 42:37.944
an unmarried lady
would never, ever be seen

42:37.980 --> 42:40.446
in the company of a gentleman
without a chaperone.

42:40.482 --> 42:41.948
Well, I suppose it's okay

42:42.017 --> 42:45.485
to break a few rules
every now and again.

42:45.521 --> 42:48.354
Speaking of breaking the rules,

42:48.423 --> 42:50.957
I think we should talk
about the monarchy.

42:51.026 --> 42:53.927
The thing about having to have
a male heir on the throne

42:53.996 --> 42:55.862
is a little ridiculous,
don't you think?

42:55.898 --> 42:58.732
Well, I suppose
when everyone is reasonable,

42:58.767 --> 43:01.100
everything works out
without worry,

43:01.136 --> 43:02.368
not at all.

43:02.404 --> 43:05.505
And besides,
too lovely an evening

43:05.541 --> 43:07.007
to talk about politics,

43:07.075 --> 43:10.376
especially when I'd much
rather talk about you.

43:16.952 --> 43:18.985
I don't think
she's coming, Nellie.

43:29.822 --> 43:32.289
They're comin'.

43:32.324 --> 43:34.591
Sure could use the help
of a good cow dog now.

43:34.626 --> 43:36.493
Now you're talkin', son.

43:39.832 --> 43:41.765
Oh, I meant to ask you.

43:41.801 --> 43:43.734
I saw Kelly on a horse
the other day.

43:43.769 --> 43:45.936
How'd you do that?

43:46.005 --> 43:49.306
Wasn't a problem.
You know, she loves horses.

43:49.341 --> 43:50.974
Could've fooled me.

43:51.010 --> 43:53.276
Figured I'd never
see her ride again.

43:53.312 --> 43:56.847
Kinda thought we didn't have
much in common anymore.

43:56.882 --> 43:59.950
You know, it might be that maybe
if you shared her interests,

43:59.985 --> 44:03.220
the two of you would
have more to talk about.

44:03.255 --> 44:05.989
I have to say I'm impressed
with your operation.

44:06.025 --> 44:09.459
We expect to be the region's
biggest supplier of beef.

44:09.494 --> 44:11.394
I'll give you some pointers,

44:11.430 --> 44:13.697
help you start an operation
of your own, if you want.

44:13.733 --> 44:16.399
That's very kind, but right now
my country's more focused

44:16.468 --> 44:17.968
on industrial development.

44:18.003 --> 44:19.480
We're actually bidding
on a major contract

44:19.504 --> 44:21.538
with a new telecommunications
manufacturer.

44:21.573 --> 44:23.741
Well, congratulations.

44:23.776 --> 44:25.142
But cattle's a good business.

44:25.177 --> 44:26.744
Yeah, uh...

44:26.779 --> 44:29.012
Actually speaking of which,
I have to take this.

44:29.081 --> 44:31.414
- Will you excuse me?
- Uh-huh.

44:33.585 --> 44:37.020
So how was the state dinner?

44:37.056 --> 44:39.123
It was fine.

44:39.158 --> 44:42.726
Oh, my gosh.
I forgot to go see Nellie.

44:42.762 --> 44:44.161
Maybe I can go see her now?

44:44.196 --> 44:45.562
It's gonna cost you a carrot.

44:45.631 --> 44:47.164
Hmm.

44:47.199 --> 44:48.309
I think I can make that work.

44:48.333 --> 44:49.833
Come on then.

44:51.904 --> 44:54.004
Uh, where are you going?

44:54.039 --> 44:56.039
Oh, we're just gonna
go to the stables.

44:56.108 --> 44:59.743
Uh, yeah,
that's gonna have to wait.

44:59.779 --> 45:03.513
I'll call you back.
Um, we've got plans.

45:03.548 --> 45:06.416
We do? I...

45:06.451 --> 45:08.718
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Don't worry about it.

45:08.754 --> 45:09.754
You don't mind, do you?

45:09.789 --> 45:13.190
Not at all, Your Majesty.

45:21.333 --> 45:25.035
Your daughter seems quite taken
with King Nikolas.

45:25.104 --> 45:26.270
Yeah.

45:28.573 --> 45:30.207
Sir?

45:30.242 --> 45:33.710
Man's all hat and no cattle.

45:38.818 --> 45:40.851
Oh, my gosh.

45:40.886 --> 45:42.252
My lady.

45:45.691 --> 45:46.890
Thank you.

45:52.698 --> 45:54.798
Where are we going?

45:54.834 --> 45:56.733
Now, that's a surprise.

46:10.349 --> 46:11.882
<i>Pride and Prejudice,</i> Your Grace.

46:11.951 --> 46:14.484
Hmm.

46:14.519 --> 46:16.286
I'm told by Miss Cece

46:16.322 --> 46:18.121
that it's one of
Princess Kelly's favorites.

46:18.190 --> 46:19.589
Mm-hmm.

46:19.658 --> 46:22.860
And I also overheard
the suggestion

46:22.928 --> 46:24.794
young Alex made to you

46:24.830 --> 46:26.296
regarding the importance

46:26.365 --> 46:29.466
of sharing
one's daughter's interests.

46:29.501 --> 46:32.702
You're starting
to get on my nerves, Boz.

46:32.771 --> 46:34.271
Many apologies, sir.

46:34.306 --> 46:36.106
I hear it quite a lot.

46:36.141 --> 46:37.875
Mm-hmm.

46:42.181 --> 46:43.881
It's a beautiful day.

46:47.519 --> 46:49.019
Beautiful.

46:49.054 --> 46:52.489
I used to ride here
when I was a boy.

46:53.592 --> 46:55.259
Now close your eyes.

47:00.299 --> 47:01.698
Now give me your hand.

47:01.733 --> 47:04.268
Little step down,
little step down.

47:06.838 --> 47:09.106
Okay, now mind
another step coming now.

47:09.141 --> 47:10.274
Can I open my eyes now?

47:10.309 --> 47:11.808
Not yet.

47:13.078 --> 47:15.045
Okay.

47:15.080 --> 47:16.313
Open them.

47:28.493 --> 47:31.428
You haven't said nothing
for the last half hour.

47:31.463 --> 47:33.630
And? Do I need to?

47:33.698 --> 47:35.665
Well, it is a rare moment.

47:39.738 --> 47:43.540
You know why a dog
is man's best friend?

47:43.575 --> 47:45.375
Yeah, I do.

47:56.555 --> 47:58.588
To us.

47:58.623 --> 48:00.490
To Merania and Angosia.

48:00.559 --> 48:02.125
No, no, no. To us.

48:05.998 --> 48:08.432
- Please, have a seat.
- Oh.

48:13.439 --> 48:17.307
So how's your father
adjusting to his new life?

48:17.343 --> 48:19.309
He's adapting.

48:19.378 --> 48:21.911
I heard you almost headed home.

48:21.947 --> 48:25.282
Oh, I think the crown fits like
a new pair of cowboy boots.

48:25.317 --> 48:27.650
When you first put them on,
it feels stiff.

48:27.686 --> 48:30.454
But once you break 'em in,
you never wanna take 'em off.

48:30.522 --> 48:32.322
So that means I might
be seeing a lot more

48:32.358 --> 48:35.492
of a certain
beautiful young lady.

48:35.527 --> 48:40.263
I'm sure you have plenty
of admirers to occupy your time.

48:40.299 --> 48:42.232
I'm sure you have just as many.

48:42.267 --> 48:45.202
Not really. No one special.

48:45.270 --> 48:48.138
Well, then I propose
another toast.

48:50.876 --> 48:53.243
To finding someone special.

49:07.493 --> 49:09.192
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:09.228 --> 49:12.062
Tractor's gonna make life
a lot easier around here.

49:12.131 --> 49:15.265
Yeah, I was thinking of clearing
that field out behind the pond.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.766
Yeah, I'll give you a hand.

49:16.801 --> 49:18.468
You guys look busy.

49:18.537 --> 49:21.004
Do you need a shovel to lean on?

49:21.040 --> 49:23.106
Look, we got a lot of work
ahead of us.

49:23.142 --> 49:24.441
But you had time to go fishing.

49:24.476 --> 49:26.410
What, I like to fish.

49:26.445 --> 49:27.744
And with company.

49:27.779 --> 49:29.046
Who told you that?

49:29.081 --> 49:31.048
The walls have ears.

49:31.083 --> 49:32.715
Oh, Boz.

49:32.784 --> 49:34.284
You can't get angry
that he told me.

49:34.319 --> 49:35.952
Yeah, why not?

49:35.987 --> 49:37.754
'Cause I forced it out of him.

49:37.789 --> 49:39.556
So who's the lucky lady?

49:39.591 --> 49:41.624
You can go anytime now.

49:41.660 --> 49:43.960
Fine.

49:43.995 --> 49:46.696
I'm really happy for you, Dad.

49:46.731 --> 49:48.765
What? We just went fishing,
that's all.

49:48.833 --> 49:50.400
Then why keep it a secret?

49:50.469 --> 49:54.771
Well, okay, I thought
you might not approve.

49:54.806 --> 49:56.373
Dad, I think it's great.

49:56.408 --> 49:59.209
You need to get out there again.

49:59.244 --> 50:00.343
Oh, you do, do you?

50:00.379 --> 50:02.179
Yes, I do.

50:02.247 --> 50:05.449
In fact, I think you should
invite your fishing buddy

50:05.484 --> 50:06.849
to the royal ball.

50:06.885 --> 50:08.296
She wouldn't mix well
with this crowd.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.486
Neither do you!

50:09.521 --> 50:12.355
It doesn't matter who she is.

50:12.424 --> 50:14.602
All that matters is she makes
you smile once in a while.

50:14.626 --> 50:17.494
Yeah, well, don't make more
out of this than there is.

50:17.529 --> 50:18.529
I'm not.

50:22.301 --> 50:23.633
What are you reading?

50:23.702 --> 50:24.867
Hmm?

50:27.406 --> 50:29.473
Oh, uh, nothing.

50:29.508 --> 50:31.774
A cookbook for trout fishing.

50:31.810 --> 50:33.410
Okay.

50:33.445 --> 50:35.878
Mm-hmm. So that it?

50:35.914 --> 50:37.292
You have to change
for the royal games.

50:37.316 --> 50:39.782
- Oh, I'm not going.
- You have to.

50:39.818 --> 50:42.152
I'm the king!
I don't have to do nothing!

50:42.221 --> 50:44.454
You can be as stubborn
as a badger sometimes.

50:44.523 --> 50:46.889
Spoken just like
my farm-raised little girl.

50:46.925 --> 50:49.626
- You are impossible.
- I'll tell you what.

50:49.661 --> 50:53.263
Life can be easier if you
just plow around the stumps.

50:53.298 --> 50:54.498
Whoa.

50:57.988 --> 51:00.155
I never realized how
much attention you get

51:00.224 --> 51:01.423
when you're royalty.

51:01.459 --> 51:05.461
It can be a bit of a fishbowl.

51:05.496 --> 51:09.064
But the trappings
of being a royal,

51:09.099 --> 51:11.933
they don't really matter
in the grand scheme of things.

51:13.804 --> 51:15.203
What really matters

51:15.272 --> 51:18.139
is finding someone special
to share it with.

51:18.175 --> 51:20.409
Someone who doesn't
take it for granted.

51:21.912 --> 51:22.878
My lady.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.613
Aww! Thank you.

51:24.648 --> 51:26.348
These are beautiful.

51:27.685 --> 51:29.385
Duty calls.

51:29.420 --> 51:30.952
Will you excuse me?

51:31.021 --> 51:32.053
Of course.

51:37.294 --> 51:39.862
I didn't expect to see you here.

51:39.897 --> 51:42.531
Your dad gave me the day off.

51:42.566 --> 51:45.166
So you know how
to use one of these?

51:45.202 --> 51:48.704
I actually was in
the archery team at Oxford.

51:48.739 --> 51:51.172
Wait a sec.

51:51.208 --> 51:52.941
You went to Oxford?

51:52.976 --> 51:55.577
Yup. Not bad for someone
who mucks out stalls, right?

51:55.613 --> 51:57.946
You went to Oxford,
and you didn't tell me?

51:57.981 --> 51:59.715
You never asked.

51:59.750 --> 52:01.884
- Really?
- Mm.

52:01.919 --> 52:05.153
So how'd you wind up
working here at the stables?

52:05.188 --> 52:07.289
Well, my dad wanted me
to follow in his footsteps,

52:07.324 --> 52:09.658
study economics, law, politics.

52:09.693 --> 52:10.959
Just wasn't for me.

52:10.994 --> 52:12.327
So now I'm studying to be a vet,

52:12.362 --> 52:14.496
and I finish in spring.

52:14.565 --> 52:16.532
He's never forgiven me since,
to be honest.

52:18.201 --> 52:20.235
I do know the feeling.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.774
So do you want to have a go?

52:25.810 --> 52:28.043
What?

52:28.078 --> 52:30.412
Do you want to give it a go?
The archery.

52:31.982 --> 52:34.950
- Oh, uh, sure.
- Okay.

52:37.354 --> 52:39.387
- Done this before?
- No.

52:39.423 --> 52:41.590
All right, come on.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.725
Stand sideways to the target.

52:43.761 --> 52:44.761
Okay.

52:46.931 --> 52:49.230
Sight the target.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.068
Sight the target and release.

52:54.572 --> 52:57.405
Oh, yes!

52:57.441 --> 52:58.707
Not bad.

52:58.742 --> 53:00.442
Oh, you think
you could do better?

53:00.478 --> 53:02.243
Watch and learn.

53:05.749 --> 53:07.583
Do you mind?

53:07.651 --> 53:09.818
Yeah, of course.

53:14.024 --> 53:15.891
All right, you can do it!

53:22.666 --> 53:24.867
That's how it's done.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.171
Come on, let's go.

53:46.690 --> 53:48.156
So how were the games?

53:48.191 --> 53:50.258
Alex taught me how
to shoot a bow and arrow.

53:50.293 --> 53:52.060
I thought you went with Nikolas.

53:52.095 --> 53:53.529
I did.

53:53.564 --> 53:54.730
I see.

53:54.765 --> 53:56.565
What does "I see" mean?

53:56.634 --> 53:58.767
It means you have
multiple suitors.

53:58.802 --> 54:02.303
Alex isn't a suitor.
He's just Alex.

54:02.372 --> 54:04.506
Should I put my hair up or down?

54:10.548 --> 54:12.180
A gift for Princess Kelly,

54:12.215 --> 54:14.683
with King Nikolas' compliments.

54:14.718 --> 54:16.451
Thank you.

54:19.322 --> 54:21.389
Speaking of multiple suitors.

54:21.425 --> 54:23.324
What do you think that is?

54:28.298 --> 54:29.665
Do you think it's real?

54:29.700 --> 54:32.233
Well, let's see. He's a king,

54:32.269 --> 54:35.003
so I'm guessing
it's not cubic zirconia.

54:35.039 --> 54:37.005
Should I wear it?

54:37.074 --> 54:39.741
I think that's the idea.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.409
Here.

54:48.418 --> 54:49.418
Wow.

54:51.722 --> 54:53.388
It's beautiful.

55:26.123 --> 55:28.189
Yeah, me too.

55:28.225 --> 55:31.994

you clean up okay.

55:32.029 --> 55:33.194
So do you.

55:33.263 --> 55:35.063
Hey, Joan.

55:35.099 --> 55:37.398
Hey, what are you doing
in a monkey suit?

55:37.434 --> 55:39.668
Castle's on a budget.
We all pitch in.

55:39.703 --> 55:43.171
Well, make yourself useful
and get me a beer, cold.

55:43.206 --> 55:46.041
Oh, and, waiter, make it two.

55:46.076 --> 55:48.877
Yeah, Hank, Your Majesty.

55:48.912 --> 55:51.346
Yeah, I'd rather have a beer.

55:51.381 --> 55:53.148
I don't really like champagne.

55:53.183 --> 55:54.783
Her Royal Highness,

55:54.818 --> 55:55.984
the Princess Kelly!

56:02.492 --> 56:05.293
"She walks like
beauty in the night."

56:05.362 --> 56:06.594
Shakespeare said it best.

56:06.630 --> 56:09.698
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

56:09.733 --> 56:12.500
Actually, it was Byron.

56:12.569 --> 56:14.269
I think you'll find
it was Shakespeare.

56:14.304 --> 56:18.573
No, he's right. It was Byron.

56:18.642 --> 56:20.976
"And all that's best
of dark and light

56:21.011 --> 56:23.178
meet in the aspect of her eyes."

56:24.882 --> 56:26.982
I see you got
the little gift I sent you.

56:27.017 --> 56:28.383
Indeed, I did.

56:28.418 --> 56:29.951
And?

56:29.987 --> 56:33.488
It's beautiful and too much.
Way too much.

No, it doesn't even begin
to do you justice.

56:40.164 --> 56:41.164
I'd love to.

57:17.167 --> 57:19.601
Why I hope you're always
honest with me.

57:19.636 --> 57:22.604
When I found out that the new
king of Merania had a daughter,

57:22.639 --> 57:25.006
I wasn't sure
I wanted to meet you.

57:25.042 --> 57:26.441

57:45.796 --> 57:49.597

No, I know you're right, but...

57:53.270 --> 57:55.270
Look, Kelly,
I didn't come to Merania

57:55.305 --> 57:58.106
to fall in love or find a bride.

57:58.142 --> 57:59.875

you are the most enchanting lady

do me the favor

the suggestion

58:12.856 --> 58:14.923
of a proposal of marriage,

58:14.958 --> 58:17.625
I would be greatly,
greatly honored.

Absolutely wonderful!

You're not gonna toast
the happy couple?

I'm not thirsty.

Hey, Nellie.

59:33.900 --> 59:36.567
How you doing, girl?

59:36.636 --> 59:37.980
My guess is
she's gonna deliver

59:38.004 --> 59:39.804
in the next day or two.

59:39.839 --> 59:42.373
You'll let me know

59:42.409 --> 59:43.775
Yeah, of course.

59:43.843 --> 59:45.676
You're up early.

59:45.712 --> 59:48.979
I wanted to say hi to Nellie
before Nikolas and I ride out.

59:49.015 --> 59:51.248
Oh, you going anywhere
interesting?

59:51.284 --> 59:54.151
No. Just a little ride
out in the country.

59:54.186 --> 59:56.287
I'm not sure King Nikolas
does a simple little ride

59:56.322 --> 59:57.789
in the country, but...

59:57.824 --> 59:59.891
He's a lot more down to earth
than you think.

59:59.926 --> 01:00:03.060
So I guess I should congratulate
you on the engagement.

01:00:03.095 --> 01:00:05.696
Nikolas and I are not engaged.

01:00:05.732 --> 01:00:07.364
Well, let me see.

01:00:07.434 --> 01:00:10.234
He asked you to marry him,
and you didn't say no.

01:00:10.269 --> 01:00:12.570
He just suggested it.
He didn't officially ask me.

01:00:12.605 --> 01:00:15.039
- And I didn't say anything.
- Well, why not?

01:00:15.107 --> 01:00:16.908
It seemed like
he very officially asked.

01:00:16.943 --> 01:00:18.609
I didn't know what to say,

01:00:18.645 --> 01:00:20.756
and I wasn't gonna embarrass him
in front of everyone.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.958
- What was I supposed to do?
- Well, you got a nice necklace.

01:00:22.982 --> 01:00:25.583
It was a gift,
not an engagement ring.

01:00:25.618 --> 01:00:26.984
Right.

01:00:27.019 --> 01:00:29.554
You know, Nikolas is
a very generous man,

01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:31.255
a little impulsive.

01:00:31.324 --> 01:00:32.868
Sounds like he's straight
out of one of your books.

01:00:32.892 --> 01:00:34.859
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:00:34.928 --> 01:00:37.495
Hey, whatever makes you happy.

01:00:37.564 --> 01:00:39.997
I'm very happy.
And to quote Elizabeth Bennet,

01:00:40.032 --> 01:00:43.233
"I am one of the happiest
creatures in the world."

01:00:43.302 --> 01:00:45.169

01:01:06.926 --> 01:01:10.094
Yup, and temperamental.

01:01:10.162 --> 01:01:12.062
Like all beautiful creatures.

01:01:12.131 --> 01:01:13.798
Shall we go?

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:17.067
I want to give you a tour of
the castle when we get back.

01:01:19.071 --> 01:01:20.972
Allow me, Your Grace.

01:01:25.945 --> 01:01:28.379
Anything else I can do?

01:01:28.414 --> 01:01:30.848
No, you've done
quite enough already.

01:01:39.358 --> 01:01:42.459
I hate to disturb you,

01:01:42.495 --> 01:01:46.130
but your ranch hand
is here to speak to you.

01:01:46.198 --> 01:01:48.232
Yeah, send him in.

01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:55.305
Brought you the cost report
on the cattle.

01:01:55.374 --> 01:01:56.908
Have a seat.

01:01:58.645 --> 01:02:00.377
- We're under budget.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:00.446 --> 01:02:02.224
You want to tell me
the real reason why you came

01:02:02.248 --> 01:02:03.948
all the way up here?

01:02:03.983 --> 01:02:07.852
All right.
I'm not sure I trust Nikolas.

01:02:07.887 --> 01:02:09.832
And he's definitely not
good enough for your daughter.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:12.924
Amen on that.
Yeah, my gut tells me

01:02:12.959 --> 01:02:15.459
there's a whole lot more
going on here.

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:17.194
My pappy used to say,

01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:20.031
"Your gut always knows before
your head figures it out."

01:02:22.468 --> 01:02:26.370
Hank, Your Majesty, do you think
it would be disrespectful

01:02:26.405 --> 01:02:30.575
if I made some discreet
inquiries about Nikolas?

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:35.245
Hmm, son, nothing's
disrespectful about the truth.

01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:38.315
In fact, right now you can be
as disrespectful as you want,

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:40.117
as far as I'm concerned.

01:02:40.152 --> 01:02:42.853
Meanwhile, I'll see
what I can find out.

01:02:42.889 --> 01:02:44.055
Okay.

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.990
- Ah, Bosworth?
- Sir.

01:02:46.025 --> 01:02:48.092
You never heard
this conversation.

01:02:48.127 --> 01:02:49.526
What conversation?

01:02:51.397 --> 01:02:52.897
Alex...

01:02:52.932 --> 01:02:54.498
don't give up.

01:03:07.513 --> 01:03:10.547
Right this way.
This is my favorite room.

01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:14.251
And right here is
Henry the Brave.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.022
His motto was
"Always follow your heart."

01:03:18.091 --> 01:03:19.490
And you should listen to him.

01:03:19.558 --> 01:03:22.093
I'm trying. It's just...

01:03:22.128 --> 01:03:24.394
Things are happening
a little too fast.

01:03:24.463 --> 01:03:26.463
Well, how long did
it take Cinderella

01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:27.910
to fall in love
with her Prince Charming?

01:03:27.934 --> 01:03:29.566
Well, that was
a fairy tale, Nikolas.

01:03:29.602 --> 01:03:31.268
This is real life.

01:03:31.337 --> 01:03:35.539
Sometimes real life can have
the sweetest of fairy tales.

01:03:37.176 --> 01:03:39.043
I-I'm so sorry to intrude.

01:03:39.078 --> 01:03:41.112
It's Nellie. The foal is coming.

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.580
- Now?
- Right now.

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.215
I am so sorry.
Something's come up.

01:03:45.284 --> 01:03:47.417
I'll finish the tour later.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.007
Am I too late?

01:04:10.043 --> 01:04:12.176
No, no, you're just in time.

01:04:13.846 --> 01:04:16.814
But the vet's delayed.
I might need your help.

01:04:16.883 --> 01:04:18.549
Oh, no, you can handle it.

01:04:18.584 --> 01:04:20.317
I mean, you could do it.

01:04:20.352 --> 01:04:21.786
No, I'll talk you through it.

01:04:21.821 --> 01:04:24.088
- You're gonna do fine, son.
- All right.

01:04:24.123 --> 01:04:25.333
When you're searching
for answers,

01:04:25.357 --> 01:04:26.957
the only way to look is up.

01:04:30.697 --> 01:04:32.863
What happened to Princess Kelly?

01:04:34.567 --> 01:04:37.534
Apparently, there was some sort
of barnyard emergency.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.037
Nikolas, are you sure
a proposal of marriage

01:04:40.073 --> 01:04:42.206
is a good idea?

01:04:42.274 --> 01:04:44.975
Arranged marriages
have allied countries

01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:47.778
for centuries, my friend.

01:04:47.847 --> 01:04:50.347
And Kelly is a lovely woman.

01:04:50.382 --> 01:04:52.282
Quite teachable.

01:04:55.621 --> 01:04:57.888
It really is
such a miracle.

01:04:57.924 --> 01:05:00.057
Yup.

01:05:00.126 --> 01:05:02.426
You did good, son.

01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:04.228
I couldn't have done it
without you.

01:05:04.263 --> 01:05:06.764
Yeah, you could.

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:10.968
But listening to advice from
some galoot with more experience

01:05:11.003 --> 01:05:13.470
never hurt anyone, right?

01:05:13.505 --> 01:05:15.773
- Are you talking to me?
- 'Course not.

01:05:15.842 --> 01:05:18.675
I'm just saying
that every new child

01:05:18.711 --> 01:05:22.446
comes with the guarantee
that God is never discouraged.

01:05:24.483 --> 01:05:26.416
Well, I got work to do.

01:05:28.988 --> 01:05:31.622
She is so beautiful.

01:05:31.657 --> 01:05:33.624
Yes, she is.

01:05:35.628 --> 01:05:38.028
Do you mind
if I stay here a while?

01:05:39.531 --> 01:05:42.099
Yeah, stay as long as you like.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.125
Look at her go.

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:59.104
She's amazing, eh?

01:05:59.139 --> 01:06:01.139
So beautiful.

01:06:05.412 --> 01:06:07.512
Any word yet?

01:06:07.581 --> 01:06:11.350
I'm working on it, Your Majesty.

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:15.621
Tried to call...
What's his name, Zeke?

01:06:15.656 --> 01:06:17.155
- Hmm.
- Several times.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.790
Yeah, well, keep trying.

01:06:18.825 --> 01:06:22.661
A man can't think straight
when his dog is sick.

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:28.600
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, Nick.

01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:30.369
Have a seat.

01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:33.372
Uh, I have a call
with my minister of finance

01:06:33.407 --> 01:06:34.706
in 10 minutes.

01:06:34.775 --> 01:06:36.241
Nice!

01:06:36.277 --> 01:06:38.310
Won't take just a minute.

01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:43.215
Hey!

01:06:47.254 --> 01:06:49.521
Yeah, she's been down
at the stable with Alex

01:06:49.556 --> 01:06:51.189
since the crack of dawn.

01:06:51.224 --> 01:06:52.769
I'm not sure I understand
why there's such a fuss

01:06:52.793 --> 01:06:54.593
about a horse.

01:06:54.628 --> 01:06:56.227
Really?

01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:58.196
Well, we're simple folk.

01:06:58.231 --> 01:07:00.666
We get worked up
about simple things.

01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:04.703
And if you ask me,
animals are God's gift.

01:07:04.772 --> 01:07:09.007
Yeah, yeah, so what is it
you wanted to speak to me about?

01:07:09.042 --> 01:07:11.242
Well, where I come from,

01:07:11.312 --> 01:07:13.779
a gentleman usually asks
a father's blessing

01:07:13.814 --> 01:07:16.981
before he proposes
to a young lady.

01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:21.186
Ah. Well, I apologize
for the impropriety,

01:07:21.221 --> 01:07:24.323
but I assume you approve.

01:07:24.358 --> 01:07:27.025
Well, if you'd asked me
like you were supposed to,

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.261
I might've told you
that my daughter is a handful

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:33.598
with her fancy ideas
and thick books.

01:07:33.634 --> 01:07:36.901
And it's only gonna get worse
when she gets her doctorate

01:07:36.937 --> 01:07:40.472
and heads off to teach
at some fancy university.

01:07:40.507 --> 01:07:43.809
Yeah, well, she'll be queen,
so she won't need to do that.

01:07:43.844 --> 01:07:45.610
Well, she doesn't take too well

01:07:45.646 --> 01:07:48.980
to being told
what she can and can't do.

01:07:49.015 --> 01:07:51.683
Look, I understand your concern,
but, uh...

01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:55.119
I assure you
I can handle your daughter.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:59.691
Well, sounds like you got it
all figured out.

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:02.427
All the answers.

01:08:02.463 --> 01:08:05.564
You know, I always believed that
there were no dumb questions,

01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:08.900
but the world sure is
full of dumb answers.

01:08:08.969 --> 01:08:11.336
She'll learn.

01:08:11.372 --> 01:08:14.806
And I promise you
I will take good care of her.

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:17.975
Can I ask you something?

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:23.814
Are you humbly grateful
or grumbly hateful?

01:08:28.654 --> 01:08:30.321
Huh.

01:08:38.365 --> 01:08:41.733
You gonna tell me
what's bothering you?

01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:44.669
I never miss a good chance
to shut up.

01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:47.171
What?

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.908
- I didn't say nothing.
- You didn't have to.

01:08:49.943 --> 01:08:51.877
Go talk to your daughter.

01:08:51.912 --> 01:08:53.612
I don't know what to say.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.979
You'll figure it out.

01:08:57.618 --> 01:09:00.919
Hank, listen to me.
When my son left for the States,

01:09:00.953 --> 01:09:02.732
there were so many things
I wanted to say to him,

01:09:02.756 --> 01:09:04.322
so much advice
I wanted to give him,

01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:06.792
but I didn't do it.

01:09:06.827 --> 01:09:09.761
Now he's all grown up
and long gone.

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:12.430
Now, Joanie, listen to me.

01:09:12.466 --> 01:09:14.966
I'm hearing you, but...

01:09:15.001 --> 01:09:17.135
do you ever notice that
when you blow in a dog's ear,

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:18.368
he gets mad,

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:19.904
but then you put him in the car,

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:23.742
and he sticks his head
right out the window?

01:09:23.777 --> 01:09:25.844
Well, that's what
I'm facing here.

01:09:25.879 --> 01:09:28.246
And I'm hearing you, Hank.

01:09:28.281 --> 01:09:32.818
But just go talk to her,
while you still can.

01:09:34.354 --> 01:09:35.520
You think?

01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:37.087
I do.

01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:51.336
Now, how did I know
you'd be here?

01:09:51.371 --> 01:09:55.173
I'm doing some research
on Angosia,

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:58.009
so that Nikolas and I
have something to discuss.

01:09:58.044 --> 01:10:00.512
Uh-huh.

01:10:00.547 --> 01:10:03.448
Ever since you were a kid,
you'd hide in a book,

01:10:03.484 --> 01:10:06.250
especially when
the going got tough.

01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:07.752
The going isn't tough.

01:10:07.788 --> 01:10:09.554
Well...

01:10:10.657 --> 01:10:12.624
Can I say something?

01:10:12.659 --> 01:10:14.526
You know,
ever since King Nikolas

01:10:14.595 --> 01:10:16.561
announced his big
engagement plans,

01:10:16.597 --> 01:10:19.898
you've been jumpier than a cat
in a roomful of rocking chairs.

01:10:19.933 --> 01:10:21.099
Funny, Dad.

01:10:21.167 --> 01:10:23.034
Can I give you some advice?

01:10:23.069 --> 01:10:26.304
- I really wish you could.
- Well, just listen to me.

01:10:26.339 --> 01:10:30.475
You can't live your life
following a writer's fantasy.

01:10:30.511 --> 01:10:32.611
Life just doesn't work that way.

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:34.646
You gotta find your own story.

01:10:34.681 --> 01:10:37.549
What do you feel in here?

01:10:37.584 --> 01:10:40.184
That's poetic for a cowboy.

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.720
Right out of that book of yours.

01:10:41.788 --> 01:10:46.892
- Which one?
- That <i> Pride and Prejudice</i> book.

01:10:46.927 --> 01:10:48.727
You read it?
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

01:10:48.762 --> 01:10:50.294
Every little tidbit of it.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.697
And that fella,
with all his daughters,

01:10:52.766 --> 01:10:54.332
didn't pull any punches.

01:10:54.401 --> 01:10:56.601
He didn't like when
he found out his sweet baby

01:10:56.637 --> 01:10:59.470
was gonna get hitched
to somebody she didn't love,

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:02.340
so he just went right out
and told her straight out

01:11:02.375 --> 01:11:06.444
that he'd never forgive her
if she went through with it.

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:09.047
I didn't say I would
go through with it.

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.315
Well, that's good to hear
because you're not in love

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:13.418
with that King Nik.

01:11:13.453 --> 01:11:14.886
Nikolas!

01:11:14.922 --> 01:11:16.220
He prefers "Nikolas."

01:11:16.256 --> 01:11:18.189
And he is very generous.

01:11:18.224 --> 01:11:20.058
I don't give a hill of beans
what he prefers.

01:11:20.126 --> 01:11:21.671
Somebody gives you
something for nothing,

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:24.462
that's about all it's worth.

01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:28.399
And you, you're smack in love
with somebody else.

01:11:28.468 --> 01:11:30.468
No, I'm not.

01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:33.237
Look, I know
you're trying to help,

01:11:33.273 --> 01:11:34.773
but I don't think
it's appropriate

01:11:34.808 --> 01:11:36.407
for you to be telling me

01:11:36.443 --> 01:11:39.210
who I'm meant to spend
the rest of my life with.

01:11:39.279 --> 01:11:42.280
Ooh, that's not a very good
poker face.

01:11:42.315 --> 01:11:45.750
Okay, I really don't need
the cowboy wisdom right now.

01:11:45.786 --> 01:11:49.520
All right.
I'll get out of your way.

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:54.759
- But just do me this one thing.
- What's that?

01:11:54.795 --> 01:11:56.895
Don't ever be as stubborn
as your old man.

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:58.964
You'll always be my princess.

01:11:58.999 --> 01:12:01.466
But there's two kinds of royal.

01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:04.035
Don't you ever forget that.

01:12:04.071 --> 01:12:06.738
- Dad?
- Hmm?

01:12:06.807 --> 01:12:09.273
Thanks for the talk.

01:12:12.079 --> 01:12:13.144
Yeah.

01:12:20.087 --> 01:12:21.052
Here you are.

01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:23.588
These are for you.

01:12:23.624 --> 01:12:24.723
Thanks.

01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:26.658
I love daisies. How'd you know?

01:12:26.693 --> 01:12:30.261
Uh, I know you
better than you think.

01:12:30.296 --> 01:12:31.462
Bosworth?

01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:33.197
It's what servants are for.

01:12:33.233 --> 01:12:37.201
So, um, I take it you've
been considering things.

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:38.903
Well, it's a lot to consider.

01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:40.449
I'm gonna need
some more time, Nikolas.

01:12:40.473 --> 01:12:42.941
Time? For what?

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:45.610
Time to finish my dissertation,
for one thing.

01:12:45.646 --> 01:12:47.612
I have to get my doctorate.

01:12:47.648 --> 01:12:50.048
Why would you bother with that
when you're going to be queen?

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:53.051
Because I have to
follow my own heart.

01:12:53.086 --> 01:12:54.519
It's a family trait.

01:12:54.554 --> 01:12:56.587
You don't really believe
all these...

01:12:56.623 --> 01:12:59.057
sentimental platitudes, do you?

01:12:59.092 --> 01:13:01.192
King Henry was a good man
with a kind heart,

01:13:01.227 --> 01:13:03.361
and it's what makes
my dad great too.

01:13:03.396 --> 01:13:04.829
It doesn't mean
they can't function

01:13:04.865 --> 01:13:06.497
or make good
and strong decisions.

01:13:06.533 --> 01:13:08.066
It makes them impractical
and foolish.

01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:10.301
Well, I guess my family's
impractical

01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:11.936
and foolish just like me.

01:13:12.005 --> 01:13:13.950
The lost sheep of the family,
is that what you are?

01:13:13.974 --> 01:13:16.941
You did not just say that,
did you?

01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:21.179
Look, all I'm saying is...

01:13:21.214 --> 01:13:24.448
you have the chance
to bring your country

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:26.584
into the modern world.

01:13:26.619 --> 01:13:28.286
Uniting Merania and Angosia

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.732
and ruling them together
makes sense.

01:13:29.756 --> 01:13:30.989
We make sense.

01:13:31.024 --> 01:13:32.891
It makes sense
on parchment paper,

01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:34.959
but I'm not gonna
give up who I am.

01:13:34.995 --> 01:13:36.995
But don't you see?
You're not giving anything up.

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:39.764
By marrying me, you're becoming
who you were always meant to be.

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:42.300
No, I'd be becoming
who <i> you</i> want me to be.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.634
And?

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:45.236
Is that so bad?

01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:47.238
Nikolas, you are very sweet,

01:13:47.273 --> 01:13:49.841
and I know that you will
one day find your queen,

01:13:49.876 --> 01:13:53.111
but I am afraid
that it's not gonna be me.

01:13:53.146 --> 01:13:55.013
You don't mean that.

01:13:55.082 --> 01:13:58.850
I mean that with all of my
impractical and foolish heart.

01:13:58.885 --> 01:14:01.219
Do you know what?
If you don't marry me,

01:14:01.254 --> 01:14:02.821
then I can't dissolve
the treaty.

01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:05.223
Oh! Even if it's
the right thing to do?

01:14:05.258 --> 01:14:07.391
No. I have a duty to my people.

01:14:07.427 --> 01:14:10.795
Even if it means not going
in good conscience?

01:14:10.831 --> 01:14:12.964
You do realize
your true colors are showing.

01:14:12.999 --> 01:14:14.899
And you do realize
that once your father

01:14:14.935 --> 01:14:17.202
finishes his charade
of playing king,

01:14:17.237 --> 01:14:19.270
then Merania, all of it,
will belong to Angosia.

01:14:19.305 --> 01:14:20.504
Do you understand that?

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.906
If you're trying to convince me

01:14:21.942 --> 01:14:23.374
to reconsider marrying you,

01:14:23.409 --> 01:14:25.576
you're not doing
a very good job.

01:14:25.612 --> 01:14:27.323
No, I'm trying to convince you
that you're making

01:14:27.347 --> 01:14:28.813
the biggest mistake
of your life.

01:14:28.849 --> 01:14:31.616
And I am glad it's mine to make.

01:14:53.754 --> 01:14:56.555
Nikolas is leaving now.

01:14:56.624 --> 01:14:59.324
Yeah, I heard.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.261
Things didn't end well
between us.

01:15:02.296 --> 01:15:05.464
Didn't much expect they would.

01:15:05.499 --> 01:15:07.766
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

01:15:07.801 --> 01:15:09.879
I've just spoken to an
old friend of mine from Oxford.

01:15:09.903 --> 01:15:13.838
He's told me something I think
you're gonna find very useful.

01:15:17.177 --> 01:15:19.177
Excuse me!

01:15:19.246 --> 01:15:20.979
Aren't you gonna say goodbye?

01:15:21.047 --> 01:15:22.847
I think that everything
that needs to be said

01:15:22.883 --> 01:15:24.082
has already been said.

01:15:24.151 --> 01:15:26.151
Oh, now, don't be
so sure of that.

01:15:26.186 --> 01:15:27.686
You leaving so soon?

01:15:27.755 --> 01:15:29.566
I have a meeting to get to.
I really have to go.

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:31.890
I think you should tell us
the real reason

01:15:31.925 --> 01:15:33.725
you were in such a rush
to get engaged.

01:15:33.794 --> 01:15:36.995
I thought I was in love,
but apparently it takes two.

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.664
That's not the real reason.

01:15:38.732 --> 01:15:39.732
Believe what you want.

01:15:39.767 --> 01:15:41.266
Can I tell you what I believe?

01:15:41.335 --> 01:15:45.937
I believe that your country
is about near bankrupt.

01:15:45.972 --> 01:15:48.973
That's outrageous.
Where'd you hear such a thing?

01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:52.977
I got my sources.
My sources are telling me

01:15:53.013 --> 01:15:54.846
that landing those contracts
you're bidding on

01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:56.315
are real important to you.

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.883
You need factories and jobs

01:15:58.919 --> 01:16:00.352
if you're not gonna go belly up.

01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:02.421
But the problem is

01:16:02.489 --> 01:16:04.489
those contracts you been
bidding on and losing

01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:07.492
are because you don't have
the raw materials,

01:16:07.561 --> 01:16:09.594
like I do back in these
mountains here.

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.331
And that's why
you're in such a rush

01:16:12.366 --> 01:16:15.166
to waltz my daughter
down the aisle.

01:16:17.404 --> 01:16:21.506
Look, Kelly, the truth is
you're a perfectly lovely lady.

01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:22.974
But I don't need you.

01:16:23.009 --> 01:16:26.277
Once your father
tires of playing king,

01:16:26.313 --> 01:16:30.181
all this, everything,
will belong to me anyway.

01:16:30.217 --> 01:16:32.217
But by then, it'll be too late.

01:16:32.285 --> 01:16:34.686
You'll already have
lost the contracts.

01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:36.788
Now the way I see it,

01:16:36.857 --> 01:16:40.325
you're sitting between a rock
and a hard place right now,

01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:43.795
unless you and I
do some real horse trading.

01:16:43.831 --> 01:16:45.564
Horse trading?

01:16:45.599 --> 01:16:48.166
- Mm-hmm.
- What His Majesty is proposing

01:16:48.201 --> 01:16:50.402
is if you guarantee Merania's
independence from Angosia

01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:52.337
once and for all,

01:16:52.373 --> 01:16:54.606
then he'll grant you the lease
to the mineral rights

01:16:54.641 --> 01:16:55.874
on those mountains.

01:16:55.909 --> 01:16:58.343
Or I could get
coronated today,

01:16:58.379 --> 01:17:02.814
just so you won't get nothing
for a very long time.

01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:03.982
You're bluffing.

01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:06.618
Oh, yeah? Then call my bluff.

01:17:06.687 --> 01:17:08.720
Now that's good horse trading.

01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:11.590
I have to think about it.

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:14.292
Well, thinking about it just
cost you 15% of the profits

01:17:14.327 --> 01:17:16.895
from the contracts.

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:18.641
You really are your father's
daughter, aren't you?

01:17:18.665 --> 01:17:19.998
You bet I am.

01:17:20.033 --> 01:17:21.533
Come on, Nicky boy.

01:17:21.602 --> 01:17:24.035
Let's just do this
and be done with it, hmm?

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:27.205
And I'll buy you a nice,
new pair of boots.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.740
How's that?

01:17:28.809 --> 01:17:31.943
So we got ourselves
a deal or not?

01:17:34.415 --> 01:17:35.680
Deal.

01:17:37.584 --> 01:17:38.884
Deal.

01:17:41.455 --> 01:17:43.688
It's an unusual proposal.

01:17:43.724 --> 01:17:46.858
It guarantees Merania's
independence from Angosia

01:17:46.894 --> 01:17:48.493
once and for all.

01:17:48.529 --> 01:17:51.897
And that means you won't be
needing a king anymore.

01:17:51.932 --> 01:17:55.099
Are you suggesting
we dissolve the monarchy?

01:17:55.168 --> 01:17:56.735
You do catch on quick.

01:17:56.804 --> 01:17:58.870
The castle and the land
would still belong

01:17:58.939 --> 01:18:00.405
to the royal family, of course.

01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:02.240
But the power
would be transferred

01:18:02.275 --> 01:18:04.242
to the Privy Council.

01:18:04.277 --> 01:18:06.511
And you're all invited
out to my place

01:18:06.547 --> 01:18:09.448
for a big barbecue celebration.

01:18:09.483 --> 01:18:10.782
Uh...

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:12.216
Deal or not?

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:16.154
As delightful as that sounds,

01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:18.857
Merania's never been
without a king.

01:18:18.926 --> 01:18:21.092
History has proven
that self-government

01:18:21.127 --> 01:18:24.028
is a preferable alternative
to the monarchy.

01:18:24.064 --> 01:18:26.531
What Oxford here is saying is

01:18:26.567 --> 01:18:29.768
you boys would be able to handle
the country on your own,

01:18:29.803 --> 01:18:33.338
unless you want me to stick
around and call the shots.

01:18:33.373 --> 01:18:35.373
Well, I suppose we can
muddle on through

01:18:35.408 --> 01:18:37.308
without you, Your Grace,

01:18:37.344 --> 01:18:40.745
though we would like you to
serve in an advisory capacity.

01:18:40.781 --> 01:18:43.849
Well, I have to
get back to you on that.

01:18:43.884 --> 01:18:46.618
But I got one more question.

01:18:46.653 --> 01:18:49.253
What are you waiting for?

01:18:49.289 --> 01:18:54.459
Well, all in favor of
the King's proposal, say aye.

01:18:54.495 --> 01:18:56.260
Aye.

01:18:56.296 --> 01:19:00.231
The motion to dissolve
the monarchy has carried.

01:19:00.266 --> 01:19:03.835
Now, if you will excuse me,
I got some fences to fix.

01:19:06.439 --> 01:19:09.741
Well, I suppose my son's
rather expensive education

01:19:09.776 --> 01:19:11.042
has finally paid off.

01:19:11.077 --> 01:19:13.778
Son? You didn't tell me
that old buzzard

01:19:13.814 --> 01:19:14.980
was your father.

01:19:15.015 --> 01:19:16.581
Guilty as charged, I guess.

01:19:16.617 --> 01:19:19.551
No! Why didn't you tell me?

01:19:19.586 --> 01:19:21.553
Didn't want you
to hold it against me.

01:19:21.588 --> 01:19:24.022
As you say, don't go
looking for trouble

01:19:24.057 --> 01:19:26.758
as you'll get your fair
share in life as it is.

01:19:26.793 --> 01:19:28.259
Mm-hmm.

01:19:28.294 --> 01:19:30.228
That's for sure.

01:19:30.263 --> 01:19:31.997
♪ Swing your partner
There she goes ♪

01:19:32.032 --> 01:19:33.765
♪ Swing her high
and swing her low ♪

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.500
♪ Now promenade
around the floor ♪

01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:37.736
♪ That's all there is
There ain't no more ♪

01:19:37.771 --> 01:19:40.972
Hey!

01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:45.510
I love happy endings.

01:19:45.579 --> 01:19:48.680
Even though you didn't wind up
with your handsome prince?

01:19:48.715 --> 01:19:50.481
Apparently the handsome prince

01:19:50.517 --> 01:19:52.617
wasn't exactly
who I thought he was.

01:19:52.653 --> 01:19:54.352
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:55.587
I'm not.

01:19:55.622 --> 01:19:57.422
Alex, remember the other day

01:19:57.457 --> 01:19:59.991
when you asked me
if I was happy?

01:20:00.027 --> 01:20:01.626
The truth is I was happy

01:20:01.662 --> 01:20:03.361
watching that foal
come into the world,

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:08.199
and I'm happy studying
and teaching and reading.

01:20:08.234 --> 01:20:11.036
I don't want to give up
who I am to be something else.

01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:14.005
And you shouldn't.
I would never let you.

01:20:14.074 --> 01:20:17.008
That's what I admire
most about you.

01:20:18.445 --> 01:20:20.879
You're always true to yourself.

01:20:20.948 --> 01:20:25.483
Even though your dad
is the chancellor?

01:20:25.552 --> 01:20:27.686
Yeah, I should've told you.

01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:29.888
I'm glad you didn't.

01:20:29.957 --> 01:20:33.157
So what would Jane Austen say?

01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:38.329
I think she not only
would approve,

01:20:38.364 --> 01:20:40.431
but she'd write about us.

01:20:40.467 --> 01:20:42.667
Over here! Over here!

01:20:42.736 --> 01:20:45.604
I gotta take care of something.
Be right back.

01:20:45.672 --> 01:20:47.005
Okay.

01:20:57.584 --> 01:20:59.951
So now that you're gonna
gonna be royalty anymore,

01:20:59.987 --> 01:21:02.453
I suppose you could be
headed home.

01:21:02.489 --> 01:21:04.789
I don't know. They want me
to stick around a bit

01:21:04.858 --> 01:21:06.390
as their advisor, but...

01:21:06.426 --> 01:21:08.226
But the more I get
to know people,

01:21:08.294 --> 01:21:09.661
the more I miss my dog?

01:21:09.696 --> 01:21:11.262
Yeah, something like that.

01:21:11.297 --> 01:21:14.232
You know, the best therapist
has fur and four legs.

01:21:14.267 --> 01:21:15.667
It's true.

01:21:15.702 --> 01:21:18.369
I know, I know.

01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:19.771
Thank you.

01:21:20.907 --> 01:21:22.440
Nice party.

01:21:22.475 --> 01:21:24.009
Wait till you try
one of these steaks.

01:21:24.044 --> 01:21:26.978
Mmm! Smells great.

01:21:27.014 --> 01:21:29.814
Dad, I...
I know I don't always listen

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:31.382
to your cowboy wisdom,

01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:34.653
but the truth is
sometimes I just need it.

01:21:34.688 --> 01:21:36.888
Thanks for always
being there for me.

01:21:36.957 --> 01:21:40.224
You know, somebody very wise
once said,

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.227
"You don't turn your back
on family."

01:21:43.263 --> 01:21:45.830
No, you don't.

01:21:45.866 --> 01:21:47.298
Come here, princess.

01:21:51.038 --> 01:21:53.905
Ah, and speaking of family.

01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:57.042
Bear?

01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:59.110
- No!
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:01.347 --> 01:22:03.982
No! Really?

01:22:08.454 --> 01:22:11.122
Oh, yeah.

01:22:11.191 --> 01:22:12.657
Good job, partner.

01:22:12.693 --> 01:22:15.459
Bosworth was having some trouble
with the red tape,

01:22:15.495 --> 01:22:17.028
so I pulled a few strings.

01:22:17.097 --> 01:22:19.463
You really might be a prince.

01:22:19.532 --> 01:22:20.732
I think you are.

01:22:20.767 --> 01:22:22.400
More of a cowpuncher.

01:22:22.435 --> 01:22:25.704
Okay, that works.

01:22:25.772 --> 01:22:28.539
So you think you could be happy
hanging out with a cowpuncher?

01:22:28.575 --> 01:22:31.843
Well, I was raised by one.

01:22:31.878 --> 01:22:34.145
You wanna go
muck out some stalls?

01:22:34.181 --> 01:22:36.647
That sounds very romantic.

01:22:36.683 --> 01:22:38.750
Oh, you want romantic?

01:22:38.785 --> 01:22:39.851
How's this?

01:23:02.776 --> 01:23:04.675
<i>Well, Dad, Joan, and Bear</i>

01:23:04.745 --> 01:23:06.878
<i>went back home
to Big Sky Country,</i>

01:23:06.913 --> 01:23:10.548
<i>while Alex and I stayed on
to raise Nellie's foal.</i>

01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:14.518
<i>Then in the springtime,
they all returned to Merania</i>

01:23:14.587 --> 01:23:17.688
<i>for our royal cowboy wedding.</i>

01:23:18.305 --> 01:23:24.701
