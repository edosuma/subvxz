00:00.042 --> 00:01.626
As my fortune says,

00:01.627 --> 00:03.544
"Soon you will reach
the end of a long journey."

00:03.545 --> 00:05.336
Does that mean I'm gonna die?

00:05.346 --> 00:07.300
Wish the Chinese mafia
would just kill me already

00:07.310 --> 00:08.633
instead of playing these games.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.176
No. No, no, no, that's not it.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.385
Don't you get it?

00:11.386 --> 00:13.387
It means we're finally gonna do it.

00:13.388 --> 00:17.266
You guys, we're gonna
finish <i>Cloud Atlas</i> tonight!

00:17.267 --> 00:19.644
The movie? That's what you got

00:19.645 --> 00:22.021
from "Soon you will reach
the end of a long journey"?

00:22.022 --> 00:25.525
We have been trying to finish
<i>Cloud Atlas</i> for over five years,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.443
ever since I was messing
with Dean's remote

00:27.444 --> 00:29.528
and then accidentally bought it?

00:29.529 --> 00:32.523
We have to keep starting over, 'cause
we respect continuity in cinema.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.450
Yeah, I don't know, guys.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.994
I just feel like I just ate,
like, a pound of lo mein, right?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.412
I'm just getting a little sleepy,

00:38.413 --> 00:39.507
so maybe another night.

00:39.517 --> 00:43.084
You always want to finish <i>Cloud Atlas.</i>
This is, like, your dream.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.789
Yeah, dude, it's only 9:45.
We'll be done by 1:00 a. m.

00:45.799 --> 00:47.463
Didn't we already watch that?

00:47.464 --> 00:50.633
Remember? It took, like, five
hours with all the commercials.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.010
No, no, no, no!

00:53.011 --> 00:54.804
- Is this true?
- No!

00:54.805 --> 00:56.847
Uh, baby, I think
that was a different movie.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.892
No, it was definitely Tom Hanks
with a face tattoo in the future.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.560
Jeff, you watched it without us?!

01:01.561 --> 01:03.104
We were supposed to do that together!

01:03.105 --> 01:05.039
You watch rom-coms with your girlfriends

01:05.049 --> 01:07.567
and progressive Wachoswski
films with your nerd friends.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.653
I'm sorry, okay?
I saw my shot, and I took it.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.447
I mean, guys, it's been five years.
I needed closure.

01:13.448 --> 01:17.343
Tara, I want you to take note
that Jeff has problems with loyalty.

01:17.353 --> 01:19.620
Guys, it's cool.
We could just watch it again.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.330
Oh, no, we cannot do that.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.000
Once you escape Alcatraz,
you don't swim back.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.878
In that scenario, is Alcatraz the movie,
or is it our friendship?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.632
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

01:34.052 --> 01:37.346
I can't believe Jeff finished
<i>Cloud Atlas</i> without us.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.390
I mean, he's not Jeff anymore.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.516
He's a couple.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.019
He is her, and she is him.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.520
They are them,

01:44.521 --> 01:46.063
and we're nothing.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.606
We're just the losers you hang out with

01:47.607 --> 01:49.567
until something better comes along.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.236
All I do is get phased out
by engagements

01:52.237 --> 01:54.905
and marathon training and mud runs.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.574
We can't lose Jeff. We have to show him

01:56.575 --> 01:57.867
that we're good friends
and we're worth keeping.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.912
What are things that good friends do?

02:01.913 --> 02:04.582
- Good friend, good friend...
- Good friends.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.542
- Hi, I'm a good friend.
- I'm a good friend.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.627
Me, too, I'm a good friend,
and this is what I do.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.297
I...

02:13.383 --> 02:15.593
- I thought you had it.
- I thought I had it.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.386
Oh, you know what? He's
always trying to get us

02:17.387 --> 02:19.430
to those pro wrestling events with him.

02:19.431 --> 02:20.723
There's gotta be something better.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.683
I'm not doing that.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.560
Got it. He's always talking about

02:24.561 --> 02:26.520
how he wants to drink more water,

02:26.521 --> 02:30.066
so we could take him out
for a cup of water.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.859
I think we just gotta go with wrestling.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.946
<i>Okay, Esther, what's the big surprise?</i>

02:35.947 --> 02:38.574
<i>If it's another puppet show,
I don't want to see it.</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:40.493
No, this is even better.

02:40.494 --> 02:45.247
We got tickets to Slamfest
at the Pechanga Casino!

02:45.248 --> 02:46.582
<i>You got tickets to Slamfest?!</i>

02:46.583 --> 02:48.084
<i>Oh! It's the grudge match</i>

02:48.085 --> 02:50.127
<i>between El Gato and Johnny Concrete!</i>

02:50.128 --> 02:51.962
I know! We're such good friends!

02:51.963 --> 02:53.547
<i>Aw, but that's tomorrow.</i>

02:53.548 --> 02:56.050
<i>Uh, listen, guys, I would love to come,</i>

02:56.051 --> 02:57.426
but I'm spending
this weekend in Big Bear

02:57.427 --> 02:58.636
with Tara and her friends.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.054
What?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.889
<i>See? There they go.</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:03.349
Jeff, did you really go to Big Bear

03:03.350 --> 03:05.267
for the weekend and not invite us?

03:05.268 --> 03:07.520
Uh, you're not <i>not</i> invited.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.897
<i>It's just that it's,
like, super boring up here.</i>

03:09.898 --> 03:12.858
<i>You know, it's just, like, cooking</i>

03:12.859 --> 03:14.777
and trees and fresh air.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.196
Jeff, we're about to play Boggle!

03:17.197 --> 03:19.448
<i>Ooh, Boggle?! Yay! I can't wait!</i>

03:19.449 --> 03:21.909
<i>Yeah, and there's, like, no TV,</i>

03:21.910 --> 03:23.620
<i>and the Wi-Fi is really ba...</i>

03:27.124 --> 03:30.626
<i>Oh, hi! Jeff, Boggle time!</i>

03:30.627 --> 03:31.794
Did you fake freeze?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.130
<i>Damn it.</i>

03:34.798 --> 03:36.841
Are my boobs really that uneven?

03:36.842 --> 03:38.175
What am I looking at?

03:38.176 --> 03:40.386
What is going on with Jeff?

03:40.387 --> 03:43.055
- I mean...
- He's going basic.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.307
He's wearing a turtleneck.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.393
His eyes lit up when they said "Boggle."

03:47.394 --> 03:48.811
We are so screwed right now.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.229
First, he's excited to play Boggle,

03:50.230 --> 03:51.522
and next thing you know,

03:51.523 --> 03:53.107
he and Tara are buying a lizard together

03:53.108 --> 03:55.109
and they're making it
its own Instagram account.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.405
And I will not follow another
lizard Instagram account.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.158
We are addicted to podcasts.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.452
It's crazy, but we listen to them

04:04.453 --> 04:05.911
when we're doing the dishes.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.329
Don't tell people that, Chris!

04:07.330 --> 04:09.290
It's so random!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.084
I got it!

04:15.213 --> 04:17.005
Hi. Can I borrow a cup of sugar...

04:17.007 --> 04:18.841
Is that you, Jeff?!

04:18.841 --> 04:20.468
No! No!

04:20.469 --> 04:21.927
Absolutely not!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.679
Yeah.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.348
Oh, my God! What are
you guys doing here?

04:26.349 --> 04:29.435
It's so weird to see you
in a calm, beautiful place.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.645
It's like seeing a clown at a funeral.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.988
I saw that once.

04:33.998 --> 04:35.858
- Of course we came. Jeff invited us.
- Yeah.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.443
It was clearly a fake invite.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.321
Oh, we accept all fake
invites as just a policy.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.198
Are these your comedian friends?

04:42.199 --> 04:45.826
Yeah. This is Esther and Benji,

04:45.827 --> 04:47.828
who I'm very surprised to see.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.955
Ha! Hi, I'm Chris Pyne.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.646
It's with a "Y," don't worry.

04:51.656 --> 04:53.450
I'm Megan. Don't mind Chris.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.294
He's just a crazy goose.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.171
But he didn't do anything.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.132
He just said his name.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.904
Obviously, I'm not a fan
of shooting innocent animals,

05:05.914 --> 05:09.225
but that wall has saved at least one
person from getting Lyme disease.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.352
All right, you can stay, okay, but...

05:11.353 --> 05:14.063
but just please try to be
normal, all right?

05:14.064 --> 05:15.705
I want to be friends
with Megan and Chris.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.846
Why are you trying to be friends
with Megan and Chris?

05:17.856 --> 05:20.639
They're so boring. They're like if
an in-flight magazine became people.

05:20.649 --> 05:22.863
And if I try and act normal,
it gets worse.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.406
- Be cool!
- Again with these...

05:24.407 --> 05:27.159
Cool and normal, what am I?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.619
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:28.620 --> 05:30.621
- There they are!
- There they are!

05:30.622 --> 05:32.947
Oh, hey, Esther, can I pour you
a glass of Sauvignon Blanc?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.458
It's from Dave Matthews' vineyard.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.085
Oh, that's a double no for me, Chris.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.379
I don't support celebrity side-projects.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.922
Okay, Scattergories!

05:39.923 --> 05:41.549
And we all have to gang up on Chris,

05:41.550 --> 05:43.008
because he always wins.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.844
Oh, Chris!

05:44.845 --> 05:46.595
I'm a bit of a logophile.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.686
I keep a word-a-day calendar
at the office.

05:48.696 --> 05:49.807
He does.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.726
I would have taken you
for more of a <i>Dilbert</i> guy.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.771
I was. That is until Megan
got me into <i>Cathy.</i>

05:55.772 --> 05:58.065
Aack!

06:00.735 --> 06:04.363
Quick question... are we 100%
for sure on Scattergories?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.283
Just 'cause I really like games
like Pretty Pretty Princess

06:07.284 --> 06:09.952
or Candy Land where the pieces are toys.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.121
Actually, I like Scattergories.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.081
I'm having a great time,
Chris and Megan.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.165
Wha...

06:15.175 --> 06:16.959
Jeff, we've had
so many good weekend trips

06:16.960 --> 06:19.086
without Scattergories. Come on, dude.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.672
Remember Santa Fe when I was going
through my turquoise phase?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.507
That was so much fun.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.010
We did a <i>Children of the Corn</i>
parody on our phones.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.928
Let's shoot a scary short film.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.930
Oh, that sounds fun.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.265
Ooh, can I be the killer?

06:31.266 --> 06:32.725
'Cause, you know, there's never been

06:32.726 --> 06:34.852
a sociopathic murderer
that's an Indian girl.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.729
Hollywood is so messed up.

06:36.730 --> 06:41.026
What about <i>The Big Bear Witch Project?</i>

06:42.402 --> 06:44.028
So it's like <i>The Blair Witch Project,</i>

06:44.029 --> 06:46.655
except that we're in Big Bear.
So I just substituted.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.490
Chris, you really
went past the joke there.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.327
Ooh, or we could do
<i>Bearanormal Activity,</i>

06:51.328 --> 06:53.078
- like <i>Paranormal Activity...</i>
- We get it.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
We'll connect the dots, thank you.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.665
Why don't we just do both?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.959
Me and Jeff will do
<i>Bear Witch</i> with Chris,

06:58.960 --> 07:01.295
and you guys can do
<i>Bearanormal Activity.</i>

07:03.089 --> 07:04.465
- Us with Megan?
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.342
Well, I feel like Me, Jeff, and Esther

07:06.343 --> 07:07.968
sort of have rapport already.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.020
We're sort of like
the Elaine, George, Jerry

07:10.030 --> 07:12.973
of five-minute low-budget horror films,
so why don't we group up?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.975
No, let's not do that.
Let's mix it up, man.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.728
Good call. Chris took film in
college for a couple years,

07:17.729 --> 07:20.648
before he pivoted
into pharmaceutical sales.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.692
Isn't pharmaceutical stuff
really bad for the country?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.695
Well, I know the perfect
spooky spot outside.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.822
- Yes, you do.
- Join me.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.366
Oh, okay! Let's go!

07:32.202 --> 07:33.869
I think I'm gonna be good at this.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.869
I've never felt like
I would be good at anything.

07:35.879 --> 07:38.173
What is that like?

07:39.584 --> 07:41.502
You're not gonna believe this.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.004
But I just got off the
phone with a townsperson

07:44.005 --> 07:46.006
<i>who told me that this cabin</i>

07:46.007 --> 07:50.552
<i>was built on an ancient
circus burial ground.</i>

07:50.553 --> 07:54.264
Some say there's a lot of
<i>Bearanormal Activity</i> in here.

07:54.265 --> 07:58.310
<i>And it's scary, so you
shouldn't be smiling.</i>

07:58.311 --> 08:00.145
Now let's go check on our friend.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.439
He doesn't believe in ghosts.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.609
Surely nothing has changed since
he went in the other room

08:05.610 --> 08:09.988
to investigate that noise.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.282
A ghost clown bear ate my legs!

08:12.283 --> 08:15.744
<i>Aaah! No! No! No!</i>

08:20.166 --> 08:22.668
<i>'Scuse me? Cut.</i>

08:24.671 --> 08:26.630
Great scream, Megan.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.799
Thank you. I think that's
gonna be a really neat take.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.093
I'm gonna post it to Facebook later.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.886
I gotta go check on my cream
cheese salsa wontons.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.140
Sounds great.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.933
Cream cheese salsa wontons
sound amazing,

08:37.933 --> 08:39.434
but Megan sucks.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.105
Her friend just got
eaten by a bear ghost,

08:41.115 --> 08:43.164
and she screamed like
someone gave her a puppy.

08:43.176 --> 08:45.345
Do we change the plot so
someone does hand her a puppy?

08:45.356 --> 08:46.396
Dude.

08:46.407 --> 08:47.735
I'm just trying to think
of solutions here.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.986
The girl still uses Facebook.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.612
How do you work with someone like that?

08:50.613 --> 08:53.323
What was that?

08:53.324 --> 08:55.492
He has lights?

08:55.493 --> 08:56.702
Cue the crane shot.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.876
He does have lights.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.947
And he's got a hockey mask!

09:00.957 --> 09:02.583
Dude, he has better wardrobe than us.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.627
We're supposed to be better than
him at this, and he's beating us!

09:05.628 --> 09:07.254
He's not gonna beat us,

09:07.255 --> 09:09.339
because it's gonna come
down to performance.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.341
And we're gonna get
a scream out of Megan,

09:11.342 --> 09:13.011
and it's gonna be real.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.890
Guys, it's cream cheese
salsa wonton time.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.184
- Death beaver!
- Aah!

09:20.185 --> 09:21.185
Cut!

09:21.186 --> 09:22.311
We got it.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.438
Oh. Uh, could we go again?

09:24.439 --> 09:26.023
I was taking a photo.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.316
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.859
Chris?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.235
Megan, she said cut,

09:30.236 --> 09:31.737
but I appreciate the commitment.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.572
Also, we haven't established a "Chris"

09:33.573 --> 09:35.298
in the world of our movie,
so it doesn't...

09:35.308 --> 09:36.784
- What's going on?
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

09:36.785 --> 09:37.951
- What's going on?!
- Aah!

09:37.952 --> 09:39.663
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

09:39.673 --> 09:40.873
- Are you okay.
- Yeah.

09:40.883 --> 09:42.122
Remember your blood pressure.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.165
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.750
What happened?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.710
Movie magic happened.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.462
Yeah, yeah, it's okay. It's okay.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.281
We'll call Dr. Gordon
first thing tomorrow, okay?

09:50.291 --> 09:51.340
Okay.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.884
Why do you need to call a
doctor? She just got startled.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.385
I'm sure she's fine.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.304
Yeah, no one ever died
from being startled.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.764
I don't know if that's true.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.892
Look, it's okay because you didn't know,

10:01.893 --> 10:03.519
but Megan's pregnant.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.146
Oh, my God! Megan, really?!

10:06.147 --> 10:08.440
We were gonna tell you
over brunch tomorrow.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.983
I am so excited!

10:09.984 --> 10:12.486
On behalf of me and Beaver Brown,
I just wanted to apologize.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.822
I thought we were going
with Justin Beaver.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.406
Wasn't a hard yes.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.201
You know, I think we're gonna go to bed.
It's kind of been a long day.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.619
I'll join you.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.662
Uh, sorry.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.417
Jeff, if anything,

10:27.418 --> 10:29.378
the scare will make her baby stronger.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.921
When my mom was pregnant with me,

10:30.922 --> 10:32.548
a grandfather clock fell on her,

10:32.549 --> 10:34.534
and now I'm really good
at guessing the time.

10:34.544 --> 10:35.859
Do you want to see?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.303
Maybe later?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.806
And how were we supposed
to know she was pregnant?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.392
Her skin is not glowing.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.810
Now you're insulting her glow?!

10:44.811 --> 10:47.521
- No!
- You guys are acting like Bozos, okay?

10:47.522 --> 10:50.232
And Tara's friends are real adults.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.900
And if they think that I'm a Bozo, too,

10:51.901 --> 10:53.443
then maybe they tell her

10:53.444 --> 10:54.695
that she can do better than me.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.488
And she can!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.323
- Jeff.
- Come on, dude.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.367
No.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.786
What's he even talking about?

11:02.787 --> 11:05.581
I'm an adult. I make noises
when I stand up and sit down.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.708
Jeff is being ridiculous.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.168
Of course we can be mature.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.171
I can't believe it's already...

11:12.172 --> 11:13.922
9:30. Boom.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.090
11:42.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.467
Scary close.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.621
Okay, this is a grown-ass brunch.

11:23.631 --> 11:26.001
Well, nothing makes people
forget about a miscarriage scare

11:26.011 --> 11:27.477
like a classy waffle.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.687
You guys are up.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.231
We figured you were "sleep in" people.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.817
Oh, we did sleep in, till 6:00 a. m.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.487
It was so decadent.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.365
Well, um...

11:40.366 --> 11:42.534
please join us for waffles.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.537
There's food you can eat.

11:44.547 --> 11:47.283
As you'll see, there's
a knife and fork to your left.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.336
Ahem.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.673
So, Chris, you're in pharmaceuticals.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.553
Um, are the generics
the same as the name brand?

12:02.639 --> 12:04.389
It's a very complicated question.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.807
I forgot my agave.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.517
Be right back. Hold that thought.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.811
She's really into syrup.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.438
We can get kicked out of IHOP.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.398
Just goes to town in there.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.946
It's just a little something
to take the edge off.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.284
Uh, were you about to eat a gummi worm

12:24.285 --> 12:26.828
- between two potato chips?
- Mm?

12:26.829 --> 12:29.707
The only people who eat like
that are five-year-olds and...

12:33.086 --> 12:36.827
Ohhh! Yes!

12:36.837 --> 12:39.394
What happened? What did she do?
What did you do? What did you do?

12:39.404 --> 12:41.051
No, no, no, I just figured it out!

12:41.052 --> 12:42.135
What?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.303
The loose-fitting clothes,

12:43.304 --> 12:45.389
the non-alcoholic beverages,

12:45.390 --> 12:48.475
the 36-packs of pudding
she brought in her own cooler?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.394
Chris, Esther's pregnant.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.525
- Aaah!
- Aah ha ha.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.068
Okay, that totally makes
sense, because you were

12:58.069 --> 12:59.528
acting kind of weird
yesterday, a little weird.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.613
- She was acting weird.
- Erratic behavior.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.236
It's okay. All is forgiven.

13:03.246 --> 13:05.534
Yes, I am pregnant.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.203
That is why I am this way.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.122
Guys, Esther's not...

13:10.123 --> 13:12.249
Telling anyone just yet.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.043
Um, not until my next semester.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.797
Well, congratulations, Dad?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.007
Dad?

13:20.008 --> 13:21.842
Sorry.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.584
- Just morning sickness.
- Right.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.554
Of course he's the father.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.348
Right, I'm...

13:28.349 --> 13:29.766
definitely the dad,

13:29.767 --> 13:33.020
and it's all totally new
and weird to me.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.731
- Bring it in. Bring it in!
- Get in!

13:35.732 --> 13:38.942
Celebrate. Ohhh!

13:38.943 --> 13:40.485
I'm so comfortable hugging!

13:40.486 --> 13:42.821
What is going on here?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.573
Is this consensual?

13:44.583 --> 13:46.992
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're just
getting to know each other.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.746
Turns out, we have a lot more
in common than we thought.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.623
I love hugging friends.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.837
I did not give you
permission to have my fictional baby.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.359
Since we've been friends, when
have I asked you for permission?

14:01.369 --> 14:03.592
Look, Jeff asked us to be grown-ups,

14:03.593 --> 14:06.094
and what's more grown up
than havin' a baby?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.138
I don't know, Esther,
maybe thinking ahead

14:08.139 --> 14:09.681
to where you're not gonna have a baby,

14:09.682 --> 14:11.202
'cause you're not actually pregnant.

14:11.212 --> 14:12.642
What's your long-term plan, dude?

14:12.643 --> 14:15.270
My long-term plan is that
we're never gonna see these dorks again,

14:15.271 --> 14:17.481
and if we do, worst-case scenario,

14:17.482 --> 14:19.066
we'll just say that the baby got stolen

14:19.067 --> 14:21.240
by one of those Chinese gymnastic camps.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.081
- That happens all the time.
- No, it doesn't.

14:23.091 --> 14:24.863
- He's behind you!
- There's the padre!

14:24.864 --> 14:27.115
Hey, Esther, do you mind if
we squeeze in some papa talk?

14:27.125 --> 14:29.117
Oh, I would love that.
He really needs guidance.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.912
He has a hard time relating
to men, so have at him.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.080
That's not true.

14:34.588 --> 14:36.374
So grateful to have gotten her pregnant.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.168
Ahh! So, nervous?

14:38.169 --> 14:39.878
I mean, I know I am.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.005
What's your birth plan?

14:42.006 --> 14:45.634
Um, the birth plan is that we, uh...

14:45.635 --> 14:47.803
we're gonna do it.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.097
Oh, I've had stretch marks
since I was six years old,

14:50.098 --> 14:52.058
so this is nothing new.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.352
It's so nice that you
laugh at the things I say

14:55.353 --> 14:57.020
now that you know I'm pregnant.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.855
Hey, guys.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.273
What are you talking about?

15:01.526 --> 15:03.110
Um, we were just talking about

15:03.111 --> 15:04.826
how there's gonna be
an eclipse next week,

15:04.836 --> 15:07.573
and we really want to go outside
and just see what it looks like before

15:07.583 --> 15:09.032
to start a baseline.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.246
Wish you could join us,
but you hate astrology.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.624
Hey.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.376
You won't believe this.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.670
Chris and Benji just left
to go canoeing.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.922
Esther and Megan
are kind of chummy, too.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.674
I mean, I'm not trying to feel left out,

15:25.675 --> 15:27.717
but I kinda do.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.762
Aw. Well, since it's just the two of us,

15:30.763 --> 15:33.723
we could go and have sex in the woods.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.226
I'm sorry. I mean... ahem!

15:36.227 --> 15:38.311
I'm sorry that you feel left out.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.605
That's terrible.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.192
But you want to anyway?

15:44.193 --> 15:47.070
- Grab that afghan.
- Okay.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.781
What a beautiful afternoon, guys.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.701
Chris and I saw a loon on the lake.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.077
It is such a noble bird.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.496
What did you two get up to?

15:56.497 --> 15:59.457
- Oh, uh... yeah.
- Oh, uh... we...

15:59.458 --> 16:01.334
We just went for a walk in the woods.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.086
Took a couple walks, actually.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.672
- Oh, my.
- Like, one walk.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.174
Calm down.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.092
I think I'm gonna do prenatal yoga.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.503
Do you want to join?

16:10.513 --> 16:11.686
Oh, my God, I would love to.

16:11.696 --> 16:13.395
I've always wanted to try
that kind of class.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.140
- Yay.
- Oh, what kind of class?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.141
Oh, well...

16:16.142 --> 16:17.310
Stop being so inquisitive.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.769
Okay, what's up?

16:19.770 --> 16:20.854
What are you guys hiding?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.230
Did you break something?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.441
Tell me it wasn't the Jacuzzi.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.902
- We should tell her.
- Um...

16:26.903 --> 16:29.070
She's pregnant!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.655
Oh... Oh, God!

16:30.656 --> 16:34.242
We're so excited for Esther
and Papa Benji!

16:34.243 --> 16:36.119
- It's Benji's?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.080
Yeah, Esther and I, um,
engaged in coitus,

16:39.081 --> 16:41.958
and my sperm made her pregnant.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.668
That's right. That's what happened.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.754
Ooookay.

16:45.755 --> 16:49.382
Okay. So that's what's going on

16:49.383 --> 16:52.052
with all the hugging
and the loon watching.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.553
Oh, gosh, you know what?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.888
I would really love to hear

16:54.889 --> 16:57.182
all the details of the conception.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.892
- Wouldn't you guys?
- I would!

16:58.893 --> 17:00.811
- Dish! Let's hear it!
- De-tails!

17:02.063 --> 17:03.647
I-I... We did it.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.900
I put my reproductive organs inside of

17:06.901 --> 17:10.237
Esther's birth cavity and...

17:10.238 --> 17:12.446
And now she's pregnant with my...

17:12.448 --> 17:14.115
- That's enough.
- Sorry.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.285
You know what? I think we need to take
some pictures of the happy couple.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.354
- Yes!
- Oh, we have so many.

17:19.364 --> 17:21.226
- I don't think we have to.
- No, you got to!

17:21.236 --> 17:22.832
Patio... soft lighting. Come on.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.209
You're gonna love it.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.044
Oh, you guys, I'm so happy for you.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.378
This is gonna be beautiful.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.588
Life finds a way.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.839
Life really finds a way.

17:31.809 --> 17:34.594
I'm so sorry. They're acting like
such idiots with your friends.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.012
Are you kidding?

17:36.013 --> 17:38.306
This weekend was so boring
until they got here.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.934
I mean, they just lied
about being pregnant, because...

17:40.935 --> 17:44.646
You know, I'm actually
not quite sure why they lied.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.314
- So you're not mad?
- No.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.607
This is the most uncomfortable

17:47.608 --> 17:49.442
I've ever seen Benji and Esther.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.778
Let's get over there
and make it worse for them.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.196
- I love you.
- I love <i>you.</i>

17:53.197 --> 17:54.781
And it was only once.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.784
All right, these pictures
are going everywhere.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.661
Okay? I'm talking Facebook, Instagram,

17:59.662 --> 18:00.904
the wall at The Comedy Store.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.052
Yeah? Oh.

18:02.062 --> 18:05.116
Benji, are your hands just
hovering over Esther's stomach?

18:05.126 --> 18:06.543
You gotta touch it.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.004
That's your kid in there, man.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.339
So protective!

18:11.340 --> 18:13.383
Is it weird that I feel kicking?

18:13.384 --> 18:17.429
Sorry. I usually eat my butterscotch
pudding at a lower altitude.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.888
Hey, Benj.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.726
Uh, why don't you get on your knees

18:22.727 --> 18:24.561
and talk to your baby?

18:24.562 --> 18:25.906
Oh, yeah. And, um, Esther,

18:25.916 --> 18:28.106
you better lift your shirt up
so the baby can hear.

18:28.116 --> 18:30.108
Good. That's a good note.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.302
- We did that. Classic.
- Look, she's already showing.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.071
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, baby.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.867
I'm sorry about what I've
done to you genetically.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.727
Okay, that's enough.
Don't want to upset the baby.

18:41.737 --> 18:42.867
Ooh, I got a great idea.

18:42.877 --> 18:44.688
Turn towards each other
and touch tummies.

18:44.698 --> 18:46.070
- Oooh!
- Okay.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.335
And you know what, when you
do it, you should kiss.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.669
Yes, on the mouth.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.963
We'd love to.

18:58.734 --> 19:00.513
- She's not pregnant!
- I'm not pregnant!

19:00.514 --> 19:04.267
What?! Whatever do you mean?!

19:04.268 --> 19:06.645
You mean, you guys aren't a couple

19:06.646 --> 19:08.688
and this was all bullshit?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.440
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.026
Are we doing a movie?
I thought we were being real people.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.986
Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.614
My friends thought that if
they pretended to be pregnant

19:17.615 --> 19:19.317
that that would impress you.

19:19.327 --> 19:22.369
Jeff, the only reason we're trying
to be real adults is because of you.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.025
If you think about it,

19:24.035 --> 19:27.163
the only think gestating
here is friendship.

19:28.316 --> 19:31.066
Also, full disclosure,
we did break the Jacuzzi.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.800
<i>That night the
train crashed into the circus,</i>

19:36.801 --> 19:38.760
<i>killing all the bears.</i>

19:38.761 --> 19:40.720
<i>And then, the bears came back</i>

19:40.721 --> 19:43.682
<i>to take revenge on the
descendents of the conductor,</i>

19:43.683 --> 19:46.351
<i>who is my ancestor.</i>

19:46.352 --> 19:50.063
30 seconds in, and I'm
not following the plot.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.481
Jeff, it's an art film.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.024
It's about the feeling

19:53.025 --> 19:54.526
you walk away from it with.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.528
It's not about
your OCD need for structure.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.405
Shh! This is a really good part.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.365
<i>A ghost clown bear ate my legs!</i>

20:00.366 --> 20:03.868
<i>Aaah! No! No! No!</i>

20:07.164 --> 20:10.208
I am so glad that
I edited that scream in post.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.918
It really elevates my work.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.421
That was good. Very good.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.506
But I think <i>Big Bear Witch Project's</i>

20:16.507 --> 20:18.174
gonna knock that out of the water.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.094
We should hang out
with Megan and Chris again

20:20.104 --> 20:22.262
before they have a baby
and get even more boring.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.014
This should be obvious, but they
don't want to see you guys again.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.015
I had a feeling.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.559
I was being sarcastic.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.937
Ahem! Get your popcorn
and possibly a diaper.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.525
And prepare yourself
for the feature presentation.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.613
- That's us in the woods.
- Mm-hmm.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.427
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>- Okay!</i>

20:42.437 --> 20:44.242
Jeff, are you sure
this is the right video?

20:44.243 --> 20:47.579
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Close your eyes!

20:47.580 --> 20:48.830
Jeffrey!
