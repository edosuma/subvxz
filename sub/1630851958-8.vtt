01:11.362 --> 01:13.406
Daughter of your fucking mother.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.344
What is it?

01:34.427 --> 01:37.722
How can he retire without finishing
his cases? I don't understand.

01:49.317 --> 01:52.779
Son of a… I'm going to kill
that damn Mickey Mouse!

01:57.951 --> 02:00.161
Look, Casimiro, I gotta be real.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.249
Judge Corchado is tough.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.330
Want me gone.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.520
Bring the pacifier.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.312
Don't feel bad, mija.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.737
In fact, tell George Clooney to watch out
'cause here comes Casimiro Morales,

08:08.404 --> 08:10.072
the new movie star.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.752
Who knows?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.876
Well, mijo. I am…

09:47.211 --> 09:48.671
so proud of you.

09:51.507 --> 09:55.303
You'll come back more Mexican
than all your gringo cousins.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.571
No, go.

10:13.654 --> 10:16.574
Go with my blessing.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.951
Hell,

10:19.702 --> 10:23.039
maybe we'll both be in Mexico.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.369
Your cousin serve the food
this time, or did he throw it again?

11:02.578 --> 11:05.915
Because I'm still suffering from PSTD
or whatever that thing is called.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.795
That bullshit.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.133
Go on.
You look like an elf.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.722
Thank you, my love.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.364
No, not me. But I like them.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.037
Look, "lippy stick."

11:47.581 --> 11:48.541
Like me.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.309
How lovely.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.061
My girl.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.415
Pfft. You're the only one
who can have them, mijo.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.584
Take them to Mexico.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.669
Make Mama Fina happy.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.848
Those boots are snake-killers!

12:59.361 --> 13:00.488
Thank you, mijo.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.073
Merry Christmas, my love.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.953
I'm giving you Salma Hayek.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.171
Because…

16:47.214 --> 16:50.759
you love her like a member of your family.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.761
She helped raise you.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.265
My chances
of staying in the country aren't good.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.105
You need him too.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.400
Erik, sit down.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.568
Lidia, sit down.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.791
What I want for you
this Christmas, I can't gift you.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.298
You can't buy this.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.927
I want you to have
what I had with Mama Fina.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.769
We were never perfect.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.106
It was never easy. But we were united.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.443
And that type of love requires commitment.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.284
You know that, Lidia?

20:29.561 --> 20:33.815
You have to give all
your energy to that woman and your baby.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.527
Not to this old man.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.280
When I go,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.492
I want you and Lidia
to be in charge of the house.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.371
Raise your family there.

20:52.209 --> 20:56.463
No, pendejo! You'd pay rent.
What would I live on in Mexico?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.008
What do you think?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.244
Well…

21:29.746 --> 21:31.248
then what you need…

21:34.668 --> 21:35.502
is this.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.797
At least it's the same sky in Mexico.

25:10.717 --> 25:14.554
The same sky I prayed to as a kid
so they wouldn't take my dad away.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.350
But here we are.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.606
The rancho breeds men of few words, mijo.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.779
I'm sorry.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.867
I never told you how much I admire you.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.164
I love you.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.008
Hello, Dad.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.676
Let's go devour some real
tacos de carnitas michoacanas.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.978
Well, right now,
I'm putting away 202 tacos.

32:22.148 --> 32:25.610
Yeah? More expert
than your grandfather, cabrón?
