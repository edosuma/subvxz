00:00.487 --> 00:02.719
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.721 --> 00:05.590
20 chefs began
the competition in Las Vegas,

00:05.591 --> 00:07.492
where they learned
this season's prize...

00:07.493 --> 00:10.595
One of you will
become my head chef

00:10.596 --> 00:13.631
at the Gordon Ramsay
Pub & Grill

00:13.632 --> 00:15.199
<i>at Caesars Palace.
What?</i>

00:15.200 --> 00:17.569
And battled it out
in the first ever signature dish

00:17.570 --> 00:18.970
done in front
of a live audience.

00:18.971 --> 00:20.371
Congratulations, ladies.
Great job.

00:20.372 --> 00:22.307
Yes! Yes!

00:22.308 --> 00:25.276
Back in L.A.,
there are high expectations

00:25.277 --> 00:28.746
and a huge turnout for the grand
reopening of Hell's Kitchen.

00:28.747 --> 00:31.282
I'm guaranteeing
a complete dinner service.

00:31.283 --> 00:33.051
But the blue
team failed to deliver.

00:33.052 --> 00:35.420
The bone thicker than the meat.

00:35.421 --> 00:37.121
It's disgusting.

00:37.122 --> 00:38.156
<i>Get it together!</i>

00:38.157 --> 00:39.457
And for chef Ramsay...

00:39.458 --> 00:41.125
Zachy-wacky.

00:41.126 --> 00:42.460
It was no laughing matter.

00:42.461 --> 00:44.095
You, Zachy-wacky?

00:44.096 --> 00:45.930
Chef Zach!
Is this a joke?

00:45.931 --> 00:47.398
The three of you, get out!

00:47.399 --> 00:48.967
Get out!
Get out!

00:48.968 --> 00:51.302
In the end, Zach
was the last man standing.

00:51.303 --> 00:52.303
I've got it, chef.

00:52.304 --> 00:53.771
I'm a monster.

00:53.772 --> 00:56.774
On the red side,
Gina failed on scallops.

00:56.775 --> 00:57.909
Overcooked.

00:57.910 --> 00:59.510
And put the blame on Nedra.

00:59.511 --> 01:00.511
Mary, do you wanna do scallops?

01:00.512 --> 01:01.980
I wanna do scallops.

01:01.981 --> 01:03.381
Somebody else
has gotta do risotto.

01:03.382 --> 01:04.715
Gina, don't throw me

01:04.717 --> 01:06.351
under the bus because
your ain't right.

01:06.352 --> 01:07.352
Get out!

01:07.353 --> 01:09.420
Those little bitches.

01:09.421 --> 01:10.622
Danielle...

01:10.623 --> 01:12.090
Come on, Danielle!

01:12.091 --> 01:13.091
Was lost.

01:13.092 --> 01:14.525
I'm confused.

01:14.526 --> 01:16.527
But chef Ramsay
gave her clear direction.

01:16.528 --> 01:18.162
Get out!

01:18.163 --> 01:19.163
!

01:19.164 --> 01:20.164
Thanks to Jessica...

01:20.165 --> 01:21.165
Who cooked the lamb?
Me, chef.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.667
Perfect.

01:22.668 --> 01:23.668
And Nedra...

01:23.669 --> 01:25.036
And the risotto was delicious.

01:25.037 --> 01:26.037
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

01:26.038 --> 01:27.038
The women rallied.

01:27.039 --> 01:28.373
Coming, chef.

01:28.374 --> 01:30.742
In the end, the
red team was victorious.

01:30.743 --> 01:32.210
And after
a tense deliberation...

01:32.211 --> 01:33.444
You ain't
doing it good, playboy.

01:33.445 --> 01:35.380
He just stepped on me
real hard!

01:35.381 --> 01:37.248
The men picked
two for elimination.

01:37.249 --> 01:38.316
Jeremy.

01:38.317 --> 01:39.317
And...

01:39.318 --> 01:40.418
Sebastian.

01:40.419 --> 01:42.420
My decision is...

01:42.421 --> 01:43.554
Sebastian.

01:43.555 --> 01:45.123
And with that, Sebastian...

01:45.124 --> 01:48.059
It's a kitchen,
not a place for comedians.

01:48.060 --> 01:51.996
<i>Became the first
to leave Hell's Kitchen.</i>

the continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:07.039 --> 03:08.506
That didn't feel good at all.

03:08.507 --> 03:11.843
I'm feeling like Jeremy got by
on the skin of his teeth,

03:11.844 --> 03:13.811
and he got a lot to prove.

03:13.812 --> 03:15.446
And he won't
be so lucky next time.

03:15.447 --> 03:16.914
It'll be adios.

03:16.915 --> 03:18.432
Sara-nara.

03:20.919 --> 03:22.987
Challenge tomorrow, gentlemen.
Can we please win it?

03:22.988 --> 03:25.189
Yep. I just get stronger
and get stronger.

03:25.190 --> 03:28.092
I still have my confidence
on winning this competition,

03:28.093 --> 03:30.495
but I'm humbled.

03:30.496 --> 03:31.796
I got a second chance.

03:31.797 --> 03:33.030
Let's start over, all right?

03:33.031 --> 03:34.732
I'm gonna have to work
a hundred times harder.

03:34.733 --> 03:38.236
<i>Tomorrow's a new day.
Yep.</i>

03:38.237 --> 03:40.138
<i>I don't like
to go to sleep angry,</i>

03:40.139 --> 03:41.305
<i>so I need to get it
off my chest.</i>

03:41.306 --> 03:43.274
So don't... at the end
of the day,

03:43.275 --> 03:44.408
don't throw me under the bus.

03:44.409 --> 03:45.843
Who?

03:45.844 --> 03:47.445
Uh, you.

03:47.446 --> 03:48.813
<i>What?
How did I throw you under the bus?</i>

03:48.814 --> 03:50.982
How the hell it's my fault
the scallops is messed up?

03:50.983 --> 03:52.383
The risotto...
I didn't say it was your fault!

03:52.384 --> 03:54.185
Well, what the hell
did you say?

03:54.186 --> 03:55.720
Somebody else
has gotta do risotto.

03:55.721 --> 03:57.388
What do you mean?

03:57.389 --> 04:00.691
It's her station.

04:00.692 --> 04:03.828
You said I'm the reason
why the scallops didn't go out.

04:03.829 --> 04:07.064
Nobody's gonna say I said
something when I didn't!

04:07.065 --> 04:09.167
Well, you don't know what
the hell you said right now.?

04:09.168 --> 04:11.969
Clearly.

04:11.970 --> 04:14.405
Don't laugh at me!

04:14.406 --> 04:15.740
She all getting
all dramatic and .

04:19.945 --> 04:21.212
Bitch, it ain't
even that serious.

04:21.213 --> 04:23.548
I'm just letting you know
what I gotta say.

04:23.549 --> 04:26.350
You better watch your "p"s and
"q"s because you don't know me.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.519
I know you crazy
as .

04:28.520 --> 04:29.754
Don't call me crazy.

04:29.755 --> 04:31.556
And watch how you talk to me.

04:34.126 --> 04:36.527
Let's press the bell, bitch,
because we can argue.

04:36.528 --> 04:38.262
Don't call me bitch!
Ding!

04:38.263 --> 04:40.498
Don't mess with a heavyweight,
and you a lightweight.

04:40.499 --> 04:43.401
You're dealing
with the wrong person.

04:43.402 --> 04:47.205
Yes, I'm dealing
with a crazy, deranged person.

04:47.206 --> 04:48.773
What a baby.

04:48.774 --> 04:50.041
You need to watch yourself.

04:50.042 --> 04:52.009
Eh, she pointed her finger at me

04:52.010 --> 04:53.444
about the risotto.

04:53.445 --> 04:55.746
off.

04:55.747 --> 04:58.149
Oh, my God,
she just broke the ceiling.

04:58.150 --> 05:01.485
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:01.486 --> 05:04.021
After a combative
night in Hell's Kitchen,

05:04.022 --> 05:08.025
chef Ramsay has a plan to keep
the chefs in the line of fire.

05:19.705 --> 05:21.472
Get up!
Get up!

05:21.473 --> 05:22.473
<i>Let's go!</i>

05:22.474 --> 05:23.474
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

05:23.475 --> 05:25.910
<i>Get up now!
Get up, get up!</i>

05:25.911 --> 05:27.945
Bam. whole military
comes flying in.

05:27.946 --> 05:29.146
"Get up, get up, get up!"

05:29.147 --> 05:30.615
I feel like
I was back in boot camp.

05:31.950 --> 05:33.351
Move it!
Keep moving.

05:33.352 --> 05:36.387
They're screaming for me
to catch up with my team.

05:36.388 --> 05:38.322
<i>Get out there!
Hurry up!</i>

05:38.323 --> 05:39.824
What team?

05:39.825 --> 05:45.663
These little bitches haven't
treated me as a team member.

05:45.664 --> 05:47.899
So I'm finished with them.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.701
Team of one.

05:50.702 --> 05:53.404
Get in line.
Let's go.

05:53.405 --> 05:54.772
Good morning.

05:54.773 --> 05:56.641
Good morning, chef.

05:56.642 --> 05:58.376
Now, this morning...

05:58.377 --> 05:59.911
<i>Excuse me, chef.</i>

05:59.912 --> 06:01.178
<i>I have something to say.</i>

06:01.179 --> 06:02.880
Please, Gina.

06:02.881 --> 06:06.250
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna be
staying here for this challenge.

06:06.251 --> 06:10.321
I'm gonna be leaving.

06:10.322 --> 06:12.223
You're happy to throw
the towel in so quickly?

06:12.224 --> 06:14.926
I have some personal issues.

06:14.927 --> 06:16.994
Unfortunately, I have to.

06:16.995 --> 06:18.696
I'm not gonna stop you.

06:18.697 --> 06:20.765
Please, go back up to the dorm,

06:20.766 --> 06:22.800
<i>pack your stuff,
and leave Hell's Kitchen.</i>

06:22.801 --> 06:24.302
Thank you, chef.

06:24.303 --> 06:25.870
Bye, Gina.

06:25.871 --> 06:27.271
Man,
right on the team challenge,

06:27.272 --> 06:29.006
this stupid bitch backs out.

06:29.007 --> 06:31.375
Bitch, you gonna back out
of doing a competition?

06:31.376 --> 06:33.978
If you can't stand the heat,
get out the kitchen.

06:33.979 --> 06:38.482
That bitch folded
like a piece of wet paper towel.

06:38.483 --> 06:40.551
Ladies, one down.

06:40.552 --> 06:41.953
Incredible.

06:41.954 --> 06:43.421
<i>Stand strong.</i>

06:43.422 --> 06:44.822
Yes, chef.

06:44.823 --> 06:47.525
Last night,
I saw minimum teamwork

06:47.526 --> 06:49.026
in both kitchens.
Agreed?

06:49.027 --> 06:50.227
Yes, chef.

06:50.228 --> 06:51.395
<i>The service</i>

06:51.396 --> 06:53.664
could have been so much easier

06:53.665 --> 06:56.167
<i>if only
you relied on each other.</i>

06:56.168 --> 06:59.770
Let me show you
how a real team works.

06:59.771 --> 07:02.373
Soldiers, take it away, please.

07:02.374 --> 07:04.241
Come on, let's go!

07:04.242 --> 07:05.643
<i>Get up there!</i>

07:05.644 --> 07:07.912
These are army people, they
start jumping over the wall.

07:07.913 --> 07:09.580
Hoorah. Hoorah. Hoorah.

07:09.581 --> 07:10.948
Go! Hoorah. Hoorah.

07:10.949 --> 07:12.850
And we're all just
standing there like,

07:12.851 --> 07:15.820
okay, now what
the do we have to do?

07:20.559 --> 07:22.626
<i>Wow.
Good job.</i>

07:25.030 --> 07:27.365
That's what I call teamwork.

07:27.366 --> 07:28.366
Absolutely.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.700
Okay.

07:29.701 --> 07:31.268
<i>Chefs...</i>

07:31.269 --> 07:34.171
It's your turn
to go over the wall.

07:34.172 --> 07:35.439
<i>Uh...</i>

07:35.440 --> 07:38.075
Oh, my God.

07:38.076 --> 07:39.410
My big ass climb over the wall?

07:39.411 --> 07:40.411
No.

07:40.412 --> 07:42.113
That is... no.

07:42.114 --> 07:43.280
That is not going to happen.

07:43.281 --> 07:46.450
Soldiers, please.

07:46.451 --> 07:47.785
One, two, three.

07:47.786 --> 07:48.786
<i>Go, go!</i>

07:48.787 --> 07:50.521
Careful, careful, careful.

07:52.090 --> 07:53.090
Happier?

07:53.091 --> 07:54.091
Yes, chef.

07:54.092 --> 07:55.192
Thank God.

07:55.193 --> 07:57.061
Now, this morning,

07:57.062 --> 07:58.829
you're gonna conquer
the wall as a team.

07:58.830 --> 08:00.331
Yes, chef.

08:00.332 --> 08:01.399
I mean, I'm looking
at this wall, and it's like,

08:01.400 --> 08:02.933
it's still, like, 8 feet high,

08:02.934 --> 08:04.402
and we still gotta get over it.

08:04.403 --> 08:08.406
But there's one more thing.

08:10.175 --> 08:11.442
Oh, what the ?

08:11.443 --> 08:16.213
A live lobster cage.

08:16.214 --> 08:18.215
<i>Oh, my God.
That's mud.</i>

08:18.216 --> 08:19.784
Yeah!

08:19.785 --> 08:23.220
I'm so stoked.
This is a physical challenge.

08:23.221 --> 08:24.522
God, I'm ready to go all out.

08:24.523 --> 08:25.523
Listen carefully.

08:25.524 --> 08:26.757
Here's how it's gonna work.

08:26.758 --> 08:28.559
<i>I want each team</i>

08:28.560 --> 08:29.760
to get over that wall.

08:29.761 --> 08:31.929
You then go into that cage

08:31.930 --> 08:33.898
and pick up
one lobster at a time.

08:33.899 --> 08:36.366
You've got five minutes

08:36.368 --> 08:39.003
<i>to get as many lobsters
as you can.</i>

08:39.004 --> 08:40.538
Think it's about time
that you started showing

08:40.539 --> 08:42.039
some form of teamwork.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.908
Yes, chef.

08:43.909 --> 08:46.444
Your time starts now.

08:47.612 --> 08:49.947
For this team-building exercise,

08:49.948 --> 08:51.782
each team
will have to work together

08:51.783 --> 08:55.186
to get their chefs over the wall
as quickly as possible

08:55.187 --> 08:56.320
so that they can gather

08:56.321 --> 08:59.090
as many lobsters
as they can in five minutes.

08:59.091 --> 09:00.591
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

09:00.592 --> 09:02.393
<i>Get out!
Seven, eight.</i>

09:02.394 --> 09:04.428
Come on, guys.
One, two, three.

09:04.429 --> 09:06.063
I'm looking at this wall,
saying there's no way

09:06.064 --> 09:07.731
that I'm getting over this.

09:07.732 --> 09:08.766
Got you.

09:08.767 --> 09:10.634
But then we had big boy Jeremy

09:10.635 --> 09:11.769
boosting us over.

09:11.770 --> 09:13.838
Come on.

09:13.839 --> 09:15.206
He was just throwing us over
like we were all rag dolls.

09:15.207 --> 09:17.541
Come on, go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

09:17.542 --> 09:18.709
Three minutes to go.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.711
Got this, guys.
15, 16.

09:20.712 --> 09:22.046
It's really, really close.

09:22.047 --> 09:24.882
I realize that, if we can get
just a couple more,

09:24.883 --> 09:26.450
we could probably
beat these boys.

09:26.451 --> 09:28.486
We're just gonna dig deep
and get it done.

09:28.487 --> 09:30.621
16, 17.

09:30.622 --> 09:32.189
Watch out.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.859
Last minute!
Let's go!

09:34.860 --> 09:36.393
Let me go, let me go!

09:36.394 --> 09:37.895
Careful.

09:37.896 --> 09:39.096
<i>My ankle.</i>

09:39.097 --> 09:40.598
My ankle rolled as soon
as I got over that wall.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.068
Injury or not,
we gotta win this challenge.

09:44.069 --> 09:45.669
You got this,
man, you got this.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.805
Ooh!

09:47.806 --> 09:49.173
20 seconds to go!

09:49.174 --> 09:51.509
Ahh!
Oh, ! Oh!

09:51.510 --> 09:54.011
I got you, I got you!

09:54.012 --> 09:56.046
<i>Seven, six... Go, go!</i>

09:56.047 --> 09:57.681
Five,

09:57.682 --> 09:59.683
<i>four, three,</i>

09:59.684 --> 10:01.318
two, one!

10:01.319 --> 10:02.853
<i>Stop!</i>

10:02.854 --> 10:04.221
!

10:04.222 --> 10:06.323
<i>Everybody line up.
.</i>

10:06.324 --> 10:08.425
Oh, my God.
Good job.

10:08.426 --> 10:11.262
<i>That is what I call teamwork.</i>

10:11.263 --> 10:12.363
Well done!

10:13.932 --> 10:14.999
Hell of a job.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.535
Chef Andi, the red team's bin.

10:17.536 --> 10:19.637
How many lobsters are in there?
31.

10:19.638 --> 10:20.738
Wow.

10:20.739 --> 10:22.806
<i>Good job, girls.
Yeah, ladies!</i>

10:22.807 --> 10:25.142
James, in the blue team's bin,

10:25.143 --> 10:26.810
<i>how many lobsters are in there?</i>

10:26.811 --> 10:29.613
37.

10:29.614 --> 10:30.648
We needed this win.

10:30.649 --> 10:32.449
We finally beat the girls.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.752
Yeah!
Yes!

10:34.753 --> 10:36.820
Let's go.
Let's take a day off now.

10:36.821 --> 10:37.821
Congratulations.

10:37.822 --> 10:39.924
Thanks, chef.

10:39.925 --> 10:43.227
You won...

10:43.228 --> 10:44.228
Nothing.

10:45.931 --> 10:47.131
<i>That's right.</i>

10:47.132 --> 10:50.201
You honestly thought
that was your challenge?

10:50.202 --> 10:52.336
<i>That was step one.</i>

10:52.337 --> 10:55.072
Now change
into your chef jackets upstairs,

10:55.073 --> 10:57.908
and meet me in the kitchen.

10:57.909 --> 11:00.244
You didn't win .

11:00.245 --> 11:02.479
The guys may have won
the physical part,

11:02.480 --> 11:06.050
but I know, I know that
they can't cook for .

11:06.051 --> 11:08.352
There's no way we're gonna lose

11:08.353 --> 11:11.455
the second part
of this challenge.

11:13.491 --> 11:14.658
I rolled on my ankle

11:14.659 --> 11:16.493
with my full weight
coming off that wall.

11:16.494 --> 11:18.796
Careful.

11:18.797 --> 11:20.998
As soon as...
as soon as I hit the ground,

11:20.999 --> 11:24.702
my ankle just went
right over it.

11:24.703 --> 11:26.704
I-I can't put any weight
on this right now.

11:26.705 --> 11:28.439
Oh, me to nayhill.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.007
me.

11:30.008 --> 11:32.142
Where's the medic?

11:32.143 --> 11:33.911
Praying that I didn't
seriously injure myself.

11:33.912 --> 11:36.447
There's, you know,
not much else we can do.

11:36.448 --> 11:39.450
<i>You may have to go to the hospital
and get some x-rays. Yeah.</i>

11:39.451 --> 11:40.851
<i>See if anything's broken.</i>

11:40.852 --> 11:42.886
I can't... I can't
get taken out of this.

11:42.887 --> 11:44.455
I can't be down.

11:44.456 --> 11:45.589
Yeah, I'm pretty scared
right now.

11:51.076 --> 11:52.076
With their lobsters collected...

11:52.077 --> 11:54.278
<i>Watch out.
Whoo!</i>

11:54.279 --> 11:57.748
The chefs quickly dress
for the second part of the challenge.

11:57.749 --> 12:00.284
Well, all of the chefs but one.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.055
I can't get taken out of this.
I can't be down.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.256
Dude, I can't sit here, like...

12:05.257 --> 12:06.324
do me a favor.

12:06.325 --> 12:07.658
I need to get
into my whites, dude.

12:07.659 --> 12:09.193
We cannot go
three losses in a row.

12:09.194 --> 12:11.395
Ankle be damned.
I can still cook.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.164
This is nothing.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.466
I can cook one-legged.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.440
<i>You okay?
I'm feeling good, chef.</i>

12:22.441 --> 12:24.709
<i>You sure?
Sprained?</i>

12:24.710 --> 12:26.377
<i>It's something, chef.
It's pretty swollen right now.</i>

12:26.378 --> 12:29.413
I admire your dedication.

12:29.414 --> 12:30.681
Uh, red team.

12:30.682 --> 12:33.317
<i>Great job.
31 lobsters.</i>

12:33.318 --> 12:36.587
Blue team, 37 lobsters.

12:36.588 --> 12:39.724
Now let me tell you
what the real challenge is.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.594
The goal is to clean as many
stunning lobsters as you can.

12:43.595 --> 12:46.163
I have never cleaned a lobster.

12:46.164 --> 12:47.164
Let me show you.

12:47.165 --> 12:49.367
Take off your claws.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.702
Knife on.
Twist.

12:51.703 --> 12:53.037
Claw number one.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.373
And extract
all of the lobster meat.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.575
And just pull that tail out.

12:57.576 --> 12:58.909
Wow.

12:58.910 --> 12:59.977
Tail, head.

12:59.978 --> 13:01.312
I mean, even the legs.

13:01.313 --> 13:02.813
I didn't even know
there was meat in the legs.

13:02.814 --> 13:06.150
I mean, that was some
pretty substantial cleaning.

13:06.151 --> 13:07.551
So I'm a little bit nervous.

13:07.552 --> 13:10.187
One presented lobster,

13:10.188 --> 13:11.288
<i>out of its shell.</i>

13:11.289 --> 13:12.323
Wow.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.591
Once you've completed

13:13.592 --> 13:15.659
the lobster on the plate,

13:15.660 --> 13:17.094
you'll come up your side
of the pass, ring the bell.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.663
If it's good, gets a point.

13:19.664 --> 13:20.998
<i>Blue team, as you know,</i>

13:20.999 --> 13:22.867
you captured 37.

13:22.868 --> 13:23.901
Red team, 31.

13:23.902 --> 13:24.969
Yes, chef.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.970
So you have to be a little bit

13:25.971 --> 13:27.071
more careful, right?

13:27.072 --> 13:28.205
Yes, chef.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.107
Both teams,
you've got ten minutes

13:30.108 --> 13:31.642
<i>for this challenge.</i>

13:31.643 --> 13:34.412
I'm from Boston, and, I mean,
lobsters are just everything.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.080
I've been doing this
all my life.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.081
This is like a no-brainer.

13:37.082 --> 13:40.017
Your ten minutes starts now.

13:40.018 --> 13:41.218
<i>Go, girls.</i>

13:41.219 --> 13:42.820
I'm gonna grab the lobster.
Grab a plate.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.021
For the second part
of a team-building challenge...

13:44.022 --> 13:45.122
Do you wanna go there?

13:45.123 --> 13:46.190
The chefs will pair up...

13:46.191 --> 13:48.392
I'll do the tail and the claws?

13:48.393 --> 13:50.361
And have ten
minutes to extract the meat

13:50.362 --> 13:52.063
from as many lobsters
as they can.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.064
Behind, behind.

13:53.065 --> 13:54.398
Let's go, guys.

13:54.399 --> 13:55.866
Come on, guys.

13:55.867 --> 13:57.001
How we looking, ladies?

13:57.002 --> 13:58.135
Good.

13:58.136 --> 14:00.471
Jessica and I,
we jump on our first one.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.472
Yes, baby.

14:01.473 --> 14:02.473
Come on, girls!

14:02.474 --> 14:04.775
We bang it out just like that.

14:04.776 --> 14:07.244
Let's go.
Go, go.

14:08.713 --> 14:09.713
Wow.

14:09.714 --> 14:11.482
<i>Two claws, two knuckles,</i>

14:11.483 --> 14:13.317
six legs, one perfect tail.

14:13.318 --> 14:14.785
<i>Good job. Excellent.
Awesome.</i>

14:14.786 --> 14:17.021
Well done, great job.
Come on.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.156
Oh, jeez.
Two claws, two knuckles,

14:19.157 --> 14:20.224
<i>one stunning tail.
Great job. Yes!</i>

14:20.225 --> 14:21.225
We're getting our ass kicked.

14:21.226 --> 14:22.226
<i>Let's go, let's go.</i>

14:22.227 --> 14:23.694
Come on, ladies,
we're already up

14:23.695 --> 14:25.362
<i>two-nothing, actually.</i>

14:25.363 --> 14:26.831
Seriously?

14:26.832 --> 14:27.965
How the
are they doing that?

14:27.966 --> 14:30.034
We're...
we're halfway there.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.802
They're all the way done
with number two.

14:31.803 --> 14:33.704
Guys, come on.

14:33.705 --> 14:35.005
The ladies have got two up.

14:35.006 --> 14:36.240
Y'all, let's go!
Come on.

14:36.241 --> 14:37.374
All right, we got 'em going.
Let's go.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.809
Behind.
Behind.

14:38.810 --> 14:40.277
Come on, come on, come on.

14:40.278 --> 14:41.879
Ring that bell, let's go.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.980
One, two, three, four, five,
six legs, one perfect.

14:42.981 --> 14:43.981
All right, come on,
grab another one.

14:43.982 --> 14:45.216
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

14:45.217 --> 14:46.217
Two to one.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.585
<i>Good job.
Great job.</i>

14:47.586 --> 14:48.953
I'm hearing these dings, man.

14:48.954 --> 14:51.088
Five, six, perfect.
Good job.

14:51.089 --> 14:54.158
And me and Jeremy don't
even have one out yet.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.794
I'm struggling right now.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.729
It's stuck, it's stuck.
Redo, redo.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.464
Man, are you serious?

15:00.465 --> 15:03.467
I'm like, we gotta get something
in the window.

15:03.468 --> 15:05.002
Jeremy and Jon!

15:05.003 --> 15:06.003
Yes, chef?

15:06.004 --> 15:07.004
What are you doing?

15:07.005 --> 15:08.305
We're going fast, chef.

15:08.306 --> 15:09.473
<i>We're going as fast as we can.
Come on!</i>

15:09.474 --> 15:11.108
<i>Three, four, five, six.</i>

15:11.109 --> 15:12.343
One stunning tail.
Great job.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.879
We start hearing the bells ring
on the blue side.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.747
Well done.

15:16.748 --> 15:18.315
Perfect.
Good job.

15:18.316 --> 15:20.351
We like, oh, .
We better catch up.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.286
Good job.

15:22.287 --> 15:23.287
Two, two, two, two.

15:23.288 --> 15:24.889
We need one big push

15:24.890 --> 15:26.257
to send us home to paradise.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.459
<i>Perfect. Good job.</i>

15:28.460 --> 15:30.327
That's... let's have a look.
Show me.

15:30.328 --> 15:31.862
One, two. One, two.
Perfect. Let's go.

15:32.864 --> 15:34.098
Come on, guys.
Come on, guys.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.400
Perfect.

15:36.401 --> 15:37.635
<i>Five, four...</i>

15:37.636 --> 15:38.936
<i>Walk it, walk it, walk it!
Three...</i>

15:38.937 --> 15:39.937
Go, go, go!
Run, run, run, run!

15:39.938 --> 15:42.406
Two, one.
Stop!

15:43.775 --> 15:44.775
That's out.

15:44.776 --> 15:48.579
That's...
that's out.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.747
<i>Men, you've got</i>

15:49.748 --> 15:53.217
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

15:53.218 --> 15:56.520
Ladies, you've got
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

15:56.521 --> 15:58.422
7, 8, 9, 10, 11!

16:07.098 --> 16:08.999
Oh, yeah.
Ladies win.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.067
Whoo!

16:12.404 --> 16:14.171
Ladies.
Well done.

16:14.172 --> 16:15.706
Thank you, chef.

16:15.707 --> 16:17.708
<i>As your reward,
you are gonna have</i>

16:17.709 --> 16:22.012
the most amazing day
on a 85-foot luxury yacht.

16:24.849 --> 16:27.084
Oh, my God!
I'm ready.

16:27.085 --> 16:29.987
I have
a very special treat for you.

16:29.988 --> 16:31.488
Katsuya,
the incredible sushi master,

16:31.489 --> 16:32.790
<i>will be sending over</i>

16:32.791 --> 16:34.792
his finest creations for lunch.

16:34.793 --> 16:38.295
After that,
I've arranged for all of you

16:38.296 --> 16:40.197
to have
the most amazing massage.

16:44.369 --> 16:46.570
Getting body massages

16:46.571 --> 16:48.806
and sipping champagne
and on yachts.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.708
I want a massage.
I need a massage.

16:50.709 --> 16:53.077
My back hurt.

16:53.078 --> 16:54.078
Ladies, off you go.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.280
Well done.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.048
<i>Rock it out!</i>

16:58.049 --> 16:59.250
That's three in a row.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.784
Three in a row.
Good job, girls.

17:00.785 --> 17:02.419
<i>Jon and Jeremy.</i>

17:02.420 --> 17:03.721
One lobster, ten minutes.

17:03.722 --> 17:04.989
Way to go.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.758
Way to help the team out.
Good job.

17:07.759 --> 17:08.759
<i>Men, you are in</i>

17:08.760 --> 17:11.095
for a horrific day.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.830
Today is fish delivery day
in Hell's Kitchen.

17:13.832 --> 17:14.897
<i>You're gonna be preparing</i>

17:14.898 --> 17:16.767
hundreds of pounds

17:16.768 --> 17:18.602
<i>of fresh halibut and branzino.</i>

17:18.603 --> 17:20.271
Each fish needs
to be gutted, de-finned,

17:20.271 --> 17:22.106
<i>scaled, portioned.</i>

17:22.107 --> 17:23.107
Got it?

17:23.108 --> 17:24.275
Yes, chef.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.146
Double time, double time.

17:29.147 --> 17:31.582
We're gonna be getting intimate
with this fish.

17:31.583 --> 17:32.716
Gross.

17:32.717 --> 17:36.186
Scaling fish, gutting gish,
portioning fish.

17:36.187 --> 17:37.921
Oh, it
stinks like a !

17:37.922 --> 17:41.125
I smell like I just got in
a Greco-Roman wrestling match

17:41.126 --> 17:42.593
with shamu, and I didn't win.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.728
Man, I hate you, fish.

17:44.729 --> 17:46.530
While the men dig
into their punishment...

17:46.531 --> 17:48.299
Oh, it stinks.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.300
The women...

17:51.169 --> 17:53.704
Are digging their reward.

17:57.275 --> 18:01.412
It's going down
on the yacht today, baby.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.579
Oh, my gosh.

18:02.580 --> 18:05.983
The yacht is massive,
it's gorgeous.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.484
Total VIP.

18:07.485 --> 18:08.852
It's just beautiful.

18:08.853 --> 18:09.987
What was going
through your mind

18:09.988 --> 18:11.155
being woken up
that early this morning?

18:11.156 --> 18:12.623
I was nervous, chef.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.191
My hoo-has
was all over the place.

18:14.192 --> 18:15.659
I had no brassiere on.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.294
Who was all over the place?

18:17.295 --> 18:18.295
My hoo-has.

18:18.296 --> 18:19.897
Hoo-has?
What are they?

18:19.898 --> 18:20.964
Susie. Annie.

18:20.965 --> 18:22.700
You've named your breasts?

18:22.701 --> 18:24.501
Susie, Annie, meet chef.

18:27.972 --> 18:30.541
Sitting there having
conversations with chef Ramsay

18:30.542 --> 18:31.842
is absolutely incredible.

18:31.843 --> 18:34.011
Teamwork is all about
understanding each other.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.412
As the orders come on,

18:35.413 --> 18:37.214
<i>don't get confused
with what's being called out.</i>

18:37.215 --> 18:38.749
Two or three of you
run to the window.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.050
<i>Come up and find out.</i>

18:40.051 --> 18:42.353
He has such great advice
for us,

18:42.354 --> 18:43.354
and he's really funny.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.688
Will you promise me one thing?

18:44.689 --> 18:46.323
Yes, chef.
Under no circumstances

18:46.324 --> 18:48.359
let Jean-Philippe
get into his speedos.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.894
Please.

18:50.895 --> 18:52.262
Thank you, ladies.
Enjoy.

18:52.263 --> 18:53.497
Thanks, chef.
Cheers.

18:53.498 --> 18:55.065
Champagne
with chef Gordon Ramsay.

18:55.066 --> 18:56.633
How awesome is that?

18:56.634 --> 18:58.769
Bye, chef!

18:58.770 --> 19:00.671
As the red team
is going full steam ahead

19:00.672 --> 19:01.839
onto the high seas...

19:01.840 --> 19:03.974
back at Hell's Kitchen,
the blue team...

19:03.975 --> 19:05.843
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.478
Finally gets a break.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.713
Lunch is served.

19:09.714 --> 19:11.515
Oh, .
What is that?

19:11.516 --> 19:13.183
Fish head soup.

19:13.184 --> 19:15.819
Oh, my.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.221
It's gonna be terrible.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.222
<i>Salud!</i>

19:18.223 --> 19:20.124
Oh, my God.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.492
Ugh.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.760
That was not good by any means.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.461
<i>What the...?</i>

19:24.462 --> 19:26.764
What the hell
is fish head soup?

19:26.765 --> 19:28.198
Who eats that?

19:28.199 --> 19:29.833
Oh, every time it hits me
with the smell,

19:29.834 --> 19:31.468
I'm gonna just upchuck.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.405
Ugh.

19:36.374 --> 19:40.544
The worst part is if I threw up,
it would look just like this.

19:43.748 --> 19:45.682
<i>Do you like your sushi?
My favorite.</i>

19:45.683 --> 19:46.850
<i>It's so fresh.</i>

19:46.851 --> 19:48.786
<i>This is so... that is...
that is really good.</i>

19:48.787 --> 19:51.088
We're on the California coast,

19:51.089 --> 19:54.091
the most gorgeous day
we could ever ask for.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.093
Oh, my God, the air.

19:56.094 --> 20:00.564
Relaxing on a huge yacht
with a massage waiting for me.

20:00.565 --> 20:01.598
It's unbelievable.

20:01.599 --> 20:04.468
The red team
has complete momentum,

20:04.469 --> 20:06.370
and I don't think
we're gonna stop anytime soon.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.645
With the much
anticipated second dinner service

20:14.646 --> 20:17.214
only hours away,
sous chef Andi...

20:17.215 --> 20:18.615
It's a serious day.

20:18.616 --> 20:19.650
<i>Yes, chef.
Okay.</i>

20:19.651 --> 20:21.485
And sous chef James...

20:21.486 --> 20:22.986
You guys need
to get this stuff done today.

20:22.987 --> 20:25.422
Are pushing for
a productive day of prep.

20:25.423 --> 20:26.890
Let's do it.

20:26.891 --> 20:28.692
And with dinner
service fast approaching...

20:28.693 --> 20:30.427
Fifth gear, fifth gear,
fifth gear.

20:30.428 --> 20:31.528
How you feeling, girls?
Good?

20:31.529 --> 20:33.464
Good. Good?

20:33.465 --> 20:35.399
Things are moving
smoothly in the red kitchen.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.533
You all right over here?

20:36.534 --> 20:37.935
Or maybe not.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.571
What the
happened to these ones?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.573
This look like
t-Rex chewed on it.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.575
Danielle...

20:44.576 --> 20:46.176
You know how expensive lamb is?

20:46.177 --> 20:48.679
I don't even know what chef's
gonna say about this .

20:48.680 --> 20:51.281
This bitch done up
three racks of lamb.

20:51.282 --> 20:52.516
How the hell you do that?

20:52.517 --> 20:54.117
This meat is sexy.

20:54.118 --> 20:55.219
You gotta finesse the meat.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.187
You gotta make love
to the meat.

20:57.188 --> 20:58.789
<i>Right now
you butchering the meat.</i>

20:58.790 --> 20:59.790
Mm-mm.

20:59.791 --> 21:01.558
You up already.
Why?

21:01.559 --> 21:03.393
If it come down to it,

21:03.394 --> 21:05.162
I'ma probably throw
Danielle under the bus

21:05.163 --> 21:06.563
and drive her over
a couple times

21:06.564 --> 21:08.432
if she don't
get her together.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.601
If chef... if chef
see that ,

21:10.602 --> 21:13.136
he is gonna cuss our asses out.

21:13.137 --> 21:15.572
While Danielle's
lamb is a total loss,

21:15.573 --> 21:17.508
over in the blue kitchen,
one chef...

21:17.509 --> 21:19.142
Jeremy.

21:19.143 --> 21:21.545
Is just lost.

21:21.546 --> 21:24.548
You're walking around here
with your head up your .

21:24.549 --> 21:26.316
Jeremy, he's moving in first
and second gear all the time.

21:26.317 --> 21:27.317
And I really need him
to pick it up.

21:27.318 --> 21:28.485
Then get it clean, man.

21:28.486 --> 21:29.720
Let's get it...
let's get it moving.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.188
Unbelievable.

21:31.189 --> 21:32.189
Uh, blue team.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.457
<i>We're opening in 30 minutes.</i>

21:33.458 --> 21:34.691
Get a grip.

21:34.692 --> 21:37.895
So we need to hurry our ass,
tidy up our stations.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.930
It's time to move,
like, we gotta go.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.064
I'm just waiting
for the chef to come back,

21:41.065 --> 21:42.366
so I can do the mushrooms.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.134
So they're not done.
Do you see what I'm doing?

21:44.135 --> 21:46.169
That was, like... that was, like,
a half hour ago though.

21:46.170 --> 21:47.671
I don't want nobody
to this up tonight.

21:47.672 --> 21:50.140
I have somebody
come over in my ear saying,

21:50.141 --> 21:51.375
"Hey, weren't you
supposed to do this?"

21:51.376 --> 21:53.243
I'm like, "Shut up.
I'm doing it."

21:53.244 --> 21:55.245
It's been clean
for 25 minutes.

21:55.246 --> 21:56.847
I'm doing everything else.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.783
Shut the up.
Focus on your .

22:04.226 --> 22:06.226
Dinner service
may be 30 minutes away,

22:06.227 --> 22:09.095
but already tension is running
high on the blue team.

22:09.096 --> 22:10.230
I'm doing everything else

22:10.231 --> 22:11.331
that everybody else
is calling out.

22:11.332 --> 22:12.799
Focus on your .

22:12.800 --> 22:14.467
Uh, guys, we don't have time

22:14.468 --> 22:15.936
to be talking
about here.

22:15.937 --> 22:16.970
Let's just
get this done.

22:16.971 --> 22:18.071
<i>Finish what you were doing</i>

22:18.072 --> 22:19.739
before you start working
on something else.

22:19.740 --> 22:20.740
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah.

22:20.741 --> 22:22.943
We just gotta get it done.

22:22.944 --> 22:24.778
I'm gonna show my team
that I'm here to stay

22:24.779 --> 22:27.414
because I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna bust it, I'm a hustle.

22:27.415 --> 22:29.249
Zach, be advised, dude.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.817
<i>I'm gonna grab some water
and get it set for the polenta.</i>

22:30.818 --> 22:32.018
I'm with you, chef.

22:32.019 --> 22:34.421
And hopefully I'll do better.

22:34.422 --> 22:36.523
I'm right here, guys,
I'm right here.

22:36.524 --> 22:38.191
Ladies, come over, please.

22:38.192 --> 22:39.526
Yes, chef. Let's go.

22:39.527 --> 22:41.795
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

22:41.796 --> 22:43.863
Line up, please.
Let's go.

22:43.864 --> 22:46.299
Okay.
Tonight I am expecting

22:46.300 --> 22:48.168
a much better service
from the blue team,

22:48.169 --> 22:49.169
<i>let me tell you.</i>

22:49.170 --> 22:50.937
Yes, chef.

22:50.938 --> 22:53.006
Ladies, show me our opening
night in Hell's Kitchen,

22:53.007 --> 22:56.409
and your performance especially,
wasn't a fluke.

22:56.410 --> 22:58.011
Yes, chef.
Good.

22:58.012 --> 22:59.846
Bottom line for all of you,

22:59.847 --> 23:02.382
<i>I really should see
some great teamwork.</i>

23:02.383 --> 23:03.383
Yes, chef.

23:03.384 --> 23:05.785
Let's go.

23:05.786 --> 23:08.054
Jean-Philippe,
open Hell's Kitchen, please.

23:08.055 --> 23:10.056
<i>Let's go.</i>

23:18.532 --> 23:19.633
Swelling gone down?

23:19.634 --> 23:20.867
It's gonna be all right.

23:20.868 --> 23:22.202
It's hurting,
but we're gonna do it.

23:22.203 --> 23:24.070
Guests are arriving.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.039
All right,
are you feeling good?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.407
Yes.
We're gonna do good.

23:27.408 --> 23:29.409
Once again, Hell's Kitchen

23:29.410 --> 23:32.145
is the place to be
in Los Angeles.

23:32.146 --> 23:34.147
Tonight, in addition to
chef Ramsay's classic dishes...

23:34.148 --> 23:35.281
What can I get
for the young lady?

23:35.282 --> 23:36.916
I'll have the lobster risotto.

23:36.917 --> 23:39.085
We're gonna start off
with the pan-seared scallops.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.487
He will also be offering...

23:40.488 --> 23:42.622
The lobster special, please.
Lobster special.

23:42.623 --> 23:45.225
Served tableside
by Nedra in the red kitchen

23:45.226 --> 23:46.926
and Jeremy in the blue.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.561
How long we steaming
the lobsters for?

23:48.562 --> 23:50.497
Six minutes, chef.
Six minutes? Good.

23:50.498 --> 23:51.998
As the first orders
are hitting the kitchens...

23:51.999 --> 23:53.099
Let's go.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.401
The pressure is now

23:54.402 --> 23:56.169
on Mary and Danielle
on appetizers

23:56.170 --> 23:58.338
to get the red kitchen
off to a good start.

23:58.339 --> 23:59.439
Ladies, here we go.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.341
On order, four covers,
table 32.

24:01.342 --> 24:02.642
Three risotto, one scallops.

24:02.643 --> 24:04.544
One lobster special,
one bass, two halibut.

24:04.545 --> 24:06.012
Yes, chef.

24:06.013 --> 24:07.814
I need two-minute warning
on scallops.

24:07.815 --> 24:09.449
We need seven minutes
for the risotto

24:09.450 --> 24:10.450
because there's three of them.

24:10.451 --> 24:11.851
I'm a butcher,

24:11.852 --> 24:13.420
but I can cook circles
around anybody.

24:13.421 --> 24:15.655
And so I'm ready
to get in there

24:15.656 --> 24:19.025
and show chef Ramsay that
I definitely know my flavors.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.994
Walking to the pass
with the risotto.

24:20.995 --> 24:23.096
Scallops?
Coming right up, chef.

24:23.097 --> 24:24.297
Risotto's right here.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.298
Behind you.

24:25.299 --> 24:26.984
How is it?

24:28.436 --> 24:29.669
What is that?

24:29.670 --> 24:30.670
muppet.

24:30.671 --> 24:32.839
All of you!

24:32.840 --> 24:35.308
All of you!
All of you!

24:35.309 --> 24:36.309
<i>Yes, chef?
Taste that!</i>

24:36.310 --> 24:38.378
Hurry up! Jessica!
Yes, chef?

24:38.379 --> 24:40.013
I haven't got time
to piss around.

24:40.014 --> 24:41.715
Coming through,
coming through.

24:41.716 --> 24:42.716
I mean, what's the first thing
you taste?

24:42.717 --> 24:44.517
White wine, chef.

24:44.518 --> 24:47.087
Come on, Mary.
Get it together!

24:47.088 --> 24:48.455
That's basic .

24:48.456 --> 24:50.056
How much wine
did you put in there?

24:50.057 --> 24:51.958
No, I put in
just a few squirts, chef.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.993
So you have to reduce it down.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.361
Yes, chef, yes, chef.

24:56.630 --> 24:58.398
Get a pan on,
start the risotto.

24:58.399 --> 24:59.399
<i>Come on!
Yes, chef.</i>

24:59.400 --> 25:00.433
Just not hot enough yet.

25:00.434 --> 25:02.102
Just give me
about ten seconds here.

25:02.103 --> 25:05.905
In Hell's Kitchen, it's
about it being 100% spot-on,

25:05.906 --> 25:10.710
no mistakes, no -ups,
exactly how it's supposed to be.

25:10.711 --> 25:11.711
Let's get it going.
Let's go, let's go.

25:11.712 --> 25:13.379
Just give me about ten seconds.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.415
While Danielle takes
ownership of Mary's risotto,

25:15.416 --> 25:16.850
over in the blue kitchen...

25:16.851 --> 25:17.951
Scallops, are they ready?

25:17.952 --> 25:18.952
Christian...
Done.

25:18.953 --> 25:19.953
Bring them then!

25:19.954 --> 25:20.954
And Zach...

25:20.955 --> 25:22.021
Three risotto!
Where are they?

25:22.022 --> 25:23.256
Working now, chef, in the pan.

25:23.257 --> 25:24.424
Are ready to impress

25:24.425 --> 25:26.459
with their first set
of appetizers.

25:26.460 --> 25:27.961
All this, go, that's three.

25:27.962 --> 25:31.998
Taste that .
Don't just push it, all right?

25:31.999 --> 25:35.502
Scallops were never cooked.

25:35.503 --> 25:38.238
Rubber scallops!

25:38.239 --> 25:40.240
Rubber scallops!

25:40.241 --> 25:41.441
<i>You having a drink?
You all right?</i>

25:41.442 --> 25:43.076
Little bit of lemon in there?

25:43.077 --> 25:44.077
<i>Hey.
Hey, you , come here.</i>

25:44.078 --> 25:45.278
We're in the .

25:45.279 --> 25:47.881
No, not a good start.
This is embarrassing.

25:47.882 --> 25:49.015
Start again!

25:49.016 --> 25:51.017
Three risotto,
one scallops.

25:51.018 --> 25:52.018
Yes, chef!

25:52.019 --> 25:53.253
Both kitchens...

25:53.254 --> 25:54.754
All right, let's go, gentlemen.

25:54.755 --> 25:56.289
Are off to a shaky start.

25:56.290 --> 25:57.490
We're gonna
get through this, ladies.

25:57.491 --> 25:58.658
We're gonna get through it.
Don't worry.

25:58.659 --> 26:00.560
But with specials on order...

26:00.561 --> 26:02.729
Lobster out, let's go!

26:02.730 --> 26:05.398
Chef Ramsay sends Nedra
and Jeremy out to the dining room

26:05.399 --> 26:07.433
to retrieve
the necessary lobsters.

26:07.434 --> 26:08.768
For this table,

26:08.769 --> 26:10.103
<i>is, uh, Jalen Rose.</i>

26:10.104 --> 26:12.906
<i>He's a massive NBA player,
okay?</i>

26:12.907 --> 26:14.774
Yeah, and which one
is that one?

26:14.775 --> 26:16.409
<i>The guy in the suit?</i>

26:16.410 --> 26:19.112
So please schmooze, schmooze, schmooze.
Yes. Schmooze, schmooze.

26:19.113 --> 26:20.547
What type of lobster
would you like tonight?

26:20.548 --> 26:22.248
I want a big one.
You want a big one.

26:22.249 --> 26:25.819
Where's Jeremy?

26:25.820 --> 26:27.720
<i>It's okay, it's okay.</i>

26:27.721 --> 26:30.323
Are you serious?

26:30.324 --> 26:32.192
I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

26:32.193 --> 26:35.094
Oh, no, you don't.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.429
You're not going anywhere.

26:36.430 --> 26:40.233
What's he doing?

26:40.234 --> 26:44.304
While Jeremy tries to
figure out where to go next...

26:44.305 --> 26:46.706
Was it that table?
That table?

26:46.707 --> 26:48.608
In the blue kitchen...

26:48.609 --> 26:49.909
Three risotto, one scallops.

26:49.910 --> 26:50.910
How long?

26:50.911 --> 26:52.045
Four or five minutes long,
tops.

26:52.046 --> 26:53.680
Well, look, his scallops
are cooked!

26:53.681 --> 26:54.981
Christian...

26:54.982 --> 26:56.382
I didn't tell you
to fire the scallops.

26:56.383 --> 26:58.017
Has jumped the gun.

26:58.018 --> 26:59.485
Yes, guys.
Sorry, guys.

26:59.486 --> 27:01.621
We've been open for 57 minutes.

27:01.622 --> 27:03.323
<i>There's nothing coming out.</i>

27:03.324 --> 27:04.891
And I don't know
what the hell is going on.

27:04.892 --> 27:07.360
<i>I don't know where the
teamwork's disappearing.</i>

27:07.361 --> 27:09.234
Christian, one portion
of scallops urgently.

27:09.235 --> 27:10.222
Yes, chef.

27:10.223 --> 27:11.831
I'm always confident
in the kitchen.

27:11.832 --> 27:14.610
Knowing that I'm backing up the kitchen
is killing me in the inside.

27:14.611 --> 27:15.635
Coming to the pass.

27:15.636 --> 27:16.970
Chef... risotto
right behind you, chef.

27:16.971 --> 27:18.104
Scallops!

27:18.105 --> 27:19.772
Dude, you gotta sear
and flip 'em.

27:19.773 --> 27:20.773
Scallops!

27:20.774 --> 27:22.108
I am flipping 'em, guys.

27:22.109 --> 27:23.109
I told you
I'm having a hard time.

27:23.110 --> 27:24.177
I apologize.

27:24.178 --> 27:26.312
Stop apologizing
and just fix it.

27:26.313 --> 27:27.714
Do something!

27:27.715 --> 27:28.715
They're not done.

27:28.716 --> 27:30.049
I'd rather die, guys,

27:30.050 --> 27:32.252
instead of serving
raw scallops on you.

27:32.253 --> 27:34.354
I must have made scallops
a million times.

27:34.355 --> 27:36.189
Scallops, please!

27:36.190 --> 27:37.790
I can't believe
I'm doing this right now.

27:37.791 --> 27:38.892
They're not done.

27:38.893 --> 27:40.693
What?

27:40.694 --> 27:42.362
Oh, .
No, no, no.

27:42.363 --> 27:44.163
This is a joke.

27:44.164 --> 27:46.032
There's just nothing
coming out.

27:46.033 --> 27:47.467
We are struggling.

27:47.468 --> 27:48.668
<i>Christian!</i>

27:48.669 --> 27:50.136
Stop me around!

27:56.534 --> 27:58.936
It's one hour
into dinner service,

27:58.937 --> 28:00.738
and almost no food
has left the kitchen.

28:00.739 --> 28:02.039
It's taking a long time, huh?

28:02.040 --> 28:03.040
Yeah.

28:03.041 --> 28:04.541
Chef... risotto
right behind you, chef.

28:04.542 --> 28:06.443
But all the blue team needs

28:06.444 --> 28:08.612
to complete its first order
of appetizers is...

28:08.613 --> 28:10.080
Scallops, please!

28:10.081 --> 28:11.148
They're not done.

28:11.149 --> 28:12.349
What?

28:12.350 --> 28:14.084
This is a joke.

28:14.085 --> 28:15.986
There's just
nothing coming out.

28:15.987 --> 28:16.987
<i>We are struggling.</i>

28:16.988 --> 28:18.022
Come on!

28:18.023 --> 28:21.592
Where's your energy?

28:21.593 --> 28:22.793
Okay, let's go.

28:22.794 --> 28:23.994
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

28:23.995 --> 28:25.796
The men have finally sent out

28:25.797 --> 28:26.797
their first appetizers.

28:26.798 --> 28:28.966
Come on, guys, keep it up.

28:28.967 --> 28:30.200
And the guests...

28:30.201 --> 28:32.236
So good.
I'm enjoying it.

28:32.237 --> 28:33.771
Are impressed.

28:33.772 --> 28:35.372
Meanwhile in the red kitchen...

28:35.373 --> 28:36.473
How long?

28:36.474 --> 28:37.641
Danielle is finally ready

28:37.642 --> 28:38.676
with her risotto.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.177
Walking on three...
three risotto.

28:40.178 --> 28:41.578
And the red team is hoping

28:41.579 --> 28:44.348
their appetizers are up
to chef Ramsay's standards.

28:44.349 --> 28:45.349
Did you taste it?

28:45.350 --> 28:46.350
<i>Yes, we tasted it.
Yes.</i>

28:46.351 --> 28:47.618
Come on, Danielle.

28:47.619 --> 28:49.219
You gotta know your .
You gotta be on it.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.689
It's not my job to taste
everything that you're doing.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.123
I'm walking on scallops.

28:53.124 --> 28:54.692
<i>Let's go
with the risotto already!</i>

28:54.693 --> 28:55.993
Okay, right behind you.
Hot.

28:55.994 --> 28:59.330
I'm ready with the risotto.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.967
<i>Too much white wine
in there again.</i>

29:02.968 --> 29:04.535
All of you.

29:04.536 --> 29:05.536
Oh, my God.

29:05.537 --> 29:06.837
Taste that.
Hurry up.

29:06.838 --> 29:10.007
<i>Taste.</i>

29:10.008 --> 29:11.508
I think that tastes good.

29:11.509 --> 29:12.910
I think it needs salt.

29:12.911 --> 29:15.245
No one can't taste
the white wine in there again?

29:15.246 --> 29:16.547
Have you got
a drinking problem?

29:16.548 --> 29:18.749
No, chef.

29:18.750 --> 29:22.553
The first thing you can taste
in there is white wine.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.221
Yes, chef.

29:24.222 --> 29:28.692
So you want about a tablespoon?

29:28.693 --> 29:30.594
You have to burn off the alcohol.
Yes, chef.

29:30.595 --> 29:32.196
I'm great at what I do,

29:32.197 --> 29:33.998
but this is hard.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.632
I mean,
this is harder than hard.

29:35.633 --> 29:38.502
Someone,
teach these two idiots

29:38.503 --> 29:39.536
how to make a risotto!

29:39.537 --> 29:40.838
Yes, chef!

29:40.839 --> 29:42.473
Mary, are you
watching what I'm dong?

29:42.474 --> 29:44.675
While Ja'nel
schools Mary and Danielle

29:44.676 --> 29:46.710
in how to make
a proper risotto,

29:46.711 --> 29:47.745
back in the blue kitchen...

29:47.746 --> 29:49.446
Two capellini, two scallops.
How long?

29:49.447 --> 29:50.447
The men...

29:50.448 --> 29:51.682
Two minutes!
One order.

29:51.683 --> 29:53.584
One order?
One order right now.

29:53.585 --> 29:56.420
Are looking to Christian
to deliver on scallops once more.

29:56.421 --> 29:57.855
Let's go then!

29:57.856 --> 29:58.956
Christian, anything else
you guys need?

29:58.957 --> 29:59.957
Anything else I can help with?

29:59.958 --> 30:02.893
I'm fine.
Okay.

30:02.894 --> 30:04.728
My responsibility is to help out
Christian as much as I can.

30:04.729 --> 30:06.196
<i>Are you guys okay?
Yep.</i>

30:06.197 --> 30:07.297
Come on, buddy.

30:07.298 --> 30:08.766
I'm asking you
if you want my help

30:08.767 --> 30:10.167
and y-you deny me.

30:10.168 --> 30:12.302
All right, this is...
this is golden right here.

30:12.303 --> 30:13.303
Let's go then.

30:13.304 --> 30:14.438
Hot, chef.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.407
Where's the scallops?
Come on, guys!

30:16.408 --> 30:17.408
Go.
Capellini's up.

30:17.409 --> 30:18.709
Walking.

30:18.710 --> 30:22.613
Chef, here you go.
Scallops.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.582
Christian!

30:25.583 --> 30:26.583
Yes, chef?

30:26.584 --> 30:28.352
He brings up scallops.

30:28.353 --> 30:30.521
rubber.

30:30.522 --> 30:32.589
I mean, seriously?

30:32.590 --> 30:34.992
What the hell are you doing?
Come on, pick it up, please.

30:34.993 --> 30:35.993
Hey, you.
Come here, you.

30:39.197 --> 30:41.698
Touch them.

30:41.699 --> 30:44.034
Hey, you, big boy, come here, you.
Yes, chef.

30:44.035 --> 30:45.369
You're the one that's supposed
to be supporting them.

30:45.370 --> 30:46.603
Yes, chef.

30:46.604 --> 30:48.472
Well, how about supporting
your gut?

30:48.473 --> 30:50.240
Both of you sit down.

30:50.241 --> 30:51.942
Hey, enjoy your .

30:51.943 --> 30:53.844
I don't know how
I'm in this situation right now.

30:53.845 --> 30:55.446
A glass of wine, please,
for the two chefs.

30:55.447 --> 30:57.081
It was... it was his scallops.

30:57.082 --> 30:58.715
I didn't even have anything
to do with them.

30:58.716 --> 30:59.950
Enjoy.

30:59.951 --> 31:01.185
You.

31:01.186 --> 31:02.619
Hey, get a grip.

31:02.620 --> 31:03.887
Scallops urgently.

31:03.888 --> 31:05.022
Heard, chef.

31:05.023 --> 31:06.090
While Jeremy and Christian

31:06.091 --> 31:07.224
dine on appetizers,

31:07.225 --> 31:09.159
well ahead
of many of their customers,

31:09.160 --> 31:11.261
over in the red kitchen...

31:11.262 --> 31:12.796
We're ready to sell the risotto.
The two risotto.

31:12.797 --> 31:14.198
Thanks to Ja'nel,

31:14.199 --> 31:17.267
Mary and Danielle are ready
to present their appetizers.

31:17.268 --> 31:18.702
Come on, work it, ladies!

31:18.703 --> 31:19.970
Okay, walking.

31:19.971 --> 31:20.971
Behind!

31:20.972 --> 31:24.208
Here's the risotto.

31:24.209 --> 31:27.511
Mary, delicious risotto.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.613
Good job, ladies.

31:29.614 --> 31:31.782
Yay, ladies, we're back.
We're back in action.

31:31.783 --> 31:33.083
Good job, Mary.

31:33.084 --> 31:34.084
Don't leave me hanging.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:34.085 --> 31:35.619
Stay in the zone.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.653
It's an hour and
a half into dinner service.

31:36.654 --> 31:37.654
Service, please.

31:37.655 --> 31:38.755
And food is finally

31:38.756 --> 31:40.324
leaving the kitchens
at a steady pace.

31:40.325 --> 31:41.758
I got your
scallops right here.

31:41.759 --> 31:43.227
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

31:43.228 --> 31:44.795
<i>We do wish you a bon appetit.
Enjoy. Thank you.</i>

31:44.796 --> 31:46.830
Are you guys done eating?
Are we done?

31:46.831 --> 31:47.898
Yes.
Can we go back and help?

31:47.899 --> 31:49.833
Yep, yes, chef.

31:49.834 --> 31:51.168
Come on!

31:51.169 --> 31:52.703
We are so behind.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.238
Look at this, man, like...

31:54.239 --> 31:55.706
Gorgeous, isn't it?
Beautiful, man.

31:55.707 --> 31:57.774
Jon, Raymond, how long?

31:57.775 --> 31:58.775
Lamb, we got the two bass.
The lamb's walking, chef.

31:58.776 --> 32:00.377
<i>The bass is right there.</i>

32:00.378 --> 32:01.745
They're just lagging behind
all the time!

32:01.746 --> 32:02.913
Let's go.

32:02.914 --> 32:04.815
Right behind,
right behind, right behind.

32:04.816 --> 32:06.750
Bass behind you, chef.

32:06.751 --> 32:09.987
This is a joke.
Try this .

32:09.988 --> 32:12.723
<i>That's awful.</i>

32:12.724 --> 32:13.724
Stop!

32:13.725 --> 32:15.025
What?

32:15.026 --> 32:17.694
All of you.

32:17.695 --> 32:19.463
Who cooked that?

32:20.965 --> 32:22.933
Come here, you.
All of you.

32:22.934 --> 32:24.501
Come here.

32:24.502 --> 32:26.970
How much more
does one need to take?

32:26.971 --> 32:29.239
<i>A dining room full of guests</i>

32:29.240 --> 32:31.542
waiting for that.

32:31.543 --> 32:33.477
I'm so pissed at myself
right now.

32:33.478 --> 32:36.280
And I just... I wanna punch myself
in the .

32:36.281 --> 32:39.082
You're making me
look like a idiot.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.951
Get out!
Chef...

32:40.952 --> 32:42.452
Leave me alone!

32:42.453 --> 32:43.453
<i>Leave! Get out! Get out!
Get out!</i>

32:43.454 --> 32:44.521
There you go.

32:44.522 --> 32:45.522
There's your second course.

32:45.523 --> 32:46.823
off!

32:46.824 --> 32:48.492
Get out!
Wow.

32:48.493 --> 32:50.561
Get the out of here!

32:54.302 --> 32:56.136
It's 90 minutes
into dinner service

32:56.137 --> 32:59.640
and unbelievably, no entrees
have left the blue kitchen.

32:59.641 --> 33:01.475
Stop!

33:01.476 --> 33:04.878
How much more
does one need to take?

33:04.879 --> 33:07.881
And chef Ramsay has
a suggestion for the blue crew.

33:07.882 --> 33:09.216
Get out!

33:09.217 --> 33:10.817
Get out!

33:10.818 --> 33:12.686
Get the out of here!

33:12.687 --> 33:15.155
Wow.

33:15.156 --> 33:16.690
<i>They don't call it
Hell's Kitchen for no reason.</i>

33:16.691 --> 33:19.793
Wow, did I
get my reamed.

33:19.794 --> 33:21.795
I promise you,
you don't wanna be here.

33:21.796 --> 33:23.163
You don't wanna be here.

33:23.164 --> 33:24.297
<i>And you know what?</i>

33:24.298 --> 33:25.699
<i>Right now we need to figure out</i>

33:25.700 --> 33:28.468
what the went wrong
with this .

33:28.469 --> 33:30.303
While the men
ponder their predicament,

33:30.304 --> 33:31.905
back in the kitchen...

33:31.906 --> 33:33.974
Here we go, five covers,
table 30, two lobster special.

33:33.975 --> 33:36.043
Two bass,
two Wellington, one lamb!

33:36.044 --> 33:37.377
Yes, chef.

33:37.378 --> 33:38.879
It's up to Susan and Ja'nel

33:38.880 --> 33:39.913
on the meat station...

33:39.914 --> 33:41.415
Put two Wellingtons in.
Got it.

33:41.416 --> 33:43.316
To keep their
entrees moving to the pass.

33:43.317 --> 33:44.317
How long?

33:44.318 --> 33:46.153
Seven minutes.
Seven. Seven minutes.

33:46.154 --> 33:48.388
I can't wait to redeem myself

33:48.389 --> 33:50.657
for the royal screw-up that
I did with my signature dish

33:50.658 --> 33:51.992
and the raw lamb.

33:51.993 --> 33:54.194
I'm courageous.
I say, "Bring it on."

33:54.195 --> 33:56.163
I know I can cook the
out of this lamb.

33:56.164 --> 33:57.631
Ja'nel, I'm gonna
need your help. Okay.

33:57.632 --> 33:59.599
<i>I need to cut this meat.
You got it.</i>

33:59.600 --> 34:01.601
Nice and quick.
Come on, girlie. Faster.

34:01.602 --> 34:02.869
It's hot.

34:02.870 --> 34:05.038
Come on, Susan, trust your gut.

34:05.039 --> 34:06.406
You know
what it should look like.

34:06.407 --> 34:07.407
Lamb!

34:07.408 --> 34:09.309
<i>Coming, chef!
Yes, chef.</i>

34:09.310 --> 34:10.444
That's good. It's good, it's
good, it's good, it's good.

34:10.445 --> 34:11.812
I'm behind you with sauce.
Garnish!

34:11.813 --> 34:13.580
Chef, garnish for lamb.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.047
Walking with Wellington.
Coming up.

34:15.049 --> 34:16.616
Bass is ready.

34:16.617 --> 34:17.918
Two Wellington, one lamb.
Walking with the entrees.

34:17.918 --> 34:19.485
Behind you.

34:19.487 --> 34:21.420
That's raw.
That's raw.

34:21.422 --> 34:22.621
<i>Ah, me.</i>

34:22.623 --> 34:26.226
Nedra, come here!
Hurry up!

34:26.226 --> 34:27.260
Yes, chef?

34:27.261 --> 34:29.496
All of you!

34:29.496 --> 34:30.630
All of you!

34:30.630 --> 34:32.899
Yes, chef.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.167
Oh, my gosh.

34:34.168 --> 34:35.168
What the is that?

34:35.168 --> 34:36.603
It's raw, chef.

34:36.603 --> 34:38.705
Who sent me raw lamb on the
signature dish? Who was that?

34:38.706 --> 34:39.840
Me...Chef.

34:39.841 --> 34:40.873
It's a joke for you, isn't it?

34:40.875 --> 34:42.109
Not a joke at all, chef.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.909
So what's that then?

34:43.911 --> 34:46.780
It's raw lamb.

34:46.781 --> 34:48.849
All of you, get out.

34:49.917 --> 34:51.051
Get out!

34:51.052 --> 34:53.120
I'm done!
Get out!

34:53.121 --> 34:54.721
This sucks.

34:54.722 --> 34:55.722
Leave it.

34:55.723 --> 34:56.889
Like, we're all talented.

34:56.891 --> 34:57.924
We're all good at what we do.

34:57.925 --> 34:59.226
Leave it!

34:59.227 --> 35:00.460
It shouldn't be that hard.

35:00.461 --> 35:02.696
Get out!

35:11.072 --> 35:13.073
I was actually

35:13.074 --> 35:18.011
expecting tonight to be
a-a good service.

35:18.012 --> 35:19.045
<i>But both kitchens</i>

35:19.046 --> 35:23.950
were a disaster.

35:23.951 --> 35:26.319
Tonight there's no such thing
as a winning team.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.421
I had two pathetic,

35:28.422 --> 35:30.223
embarrassing brigades.

35:30.224 --> 35:32.893
<i>And so I want each team</i>

35:32.894 --> 35:36.463
to do something that they
haven't done all night.

35:36.464 --> 35:38.665
Communicate.

35:38.666 --> 35:41.468
And come up with two individuals
on the blue team

35:41.469 --> 35:43.103
and two individuals
on the red team that you think

35:43.104 --> 35:47.874
<i>should leave Hell's Kitchen.</i>

35:47.875 --> 35:49.009
Got it?

35:49.010 --> 35:50.010
Yes, chef.

35:50.011 --> 35:51.645
Piss off.

35:51.646 --> 35:52.879
<i>Pathetic.</i>

35:52.880 --> 35:54.181
I'm real pissed at my team.

35:54.182 --> 35:56.183
I can't put up
with too much of that .

35:56.184 --> 35:57.684
I blame everybody
for tonight's disaster.

35:57.685 --> 35:59.519
Biggest question on my mind is,

35:59.520 --> 36:02.656
who's the next
I'm getting out of here?

36:02.657 --> 36:04.024
<i>Let's get to business.</i>

36:04.025 --> 36:05.659
We gotta put up two people.
Just vote.

36:05.660 --> 36:06.660
Christian.

36:06.661 --> 36:07.828
All right, one for Christian.

36:07.829 --> 36:08.829
Christian.

36:08.830 --> 36:09.830
Barret?

36:09.831 --> 36:12.365
I would say Christian

36:12.366 --> 36:13.366
because he needed
the most help.

36:13.367 --> 36:15.802
I mean, he froze up.

36:15.803 --> 36:16.970
I won't lie
that I froze up, guys.

36:16.971 --> 36:18.471
<i>But listen,
I-I fight for myself.</i>

36:18.472 --> 36:20.674
I will get better
and do better.

36:20.675 --> 36:23.009
You have to accept
when you make mistakes.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.778
If I stay here
and get a second chance,

36:24.779 --> 36:26.746
I'll step up, and I'll show
chef Ramsay I'm here to win.

36:26.747 --> 36:29.082
I'm going with Jeremy.

36:29.083 --> 36:30.483
<i>Because when we were prepping,</i>

36:30.484 --> 36:32.719
he didn't have a second,
third, or fourth gear.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.387
I'm sorry to say it,

36:34.388 --> 36:36.923
<i>but you didn't take
any initiative.</i>

36:36.924 --> 36:38.592
I agree with Mike.

36:38.593 --> 36:40.327
Jeremy, who's the last person
to get downstairs?

36:40.328 --> 36:41.795
<i>Who's the last person
to get anything, dude?</i>

36:41.796 --> 36:43.129
You're always the last one.

36:43.130 --> 36:44.564
Anthony gets down before you.

36:44.565 --> 36:46.800
You've got a up foot.

36:46.801 --> 36:50.203
There's not enough hustle.

36:50.204 --> 36:52.205
What more
did you guys want me to do?

36:52.206 --> 36:54.407
I don't belong
in front of Ramsay.

36:54.408 --> 36:56.710
I asked every single station
if they needed my help.

36:56.711 --> 36:57.844
Did you even watch me
on my service?

36:57.845 --> 37:00.580
I lifted the whole team
off a wall.

37:00.581 --> 37:03.583
Come on.

37:03.584 --> 37:05.619
What us up
was appetizers.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.416
It was appetizers.

37:10.291 --> 37:12.759
The apps
were definitely the weakest.

37:12.760 --> 37:17.297
Mary and Danielle
clearly held us back.

37:17.298 --> 37:18.965
Once I got a handle
on what I was doing,

37:18.966 --> 37:20.267
<i>I freakin' fought back.</i>

37:20.268 --> 37:22.402
<i>And none of my other dishes
came back</i>

37:22.403 --> 37:24.804
once I got the handle on it.

37:24.805 --> 37:26.506
Mary, I appreciate you
owning it.

37:26.507 --> 37:31.177
<i>And, Danielle, I don't hear you
fighting for it.</i>

37:31.178 --> 37:32.245
If you wanna be here,

37:32.246 --> 37:34.948
<i>tell us what you think.</i>

37:34.949 --> 37:38.952
There were problems
in everybody's station.

37:38.953 --> 37:41.988
The lamb came back undercooked.

37:41.989 --> 37:42.989
Because of
the appetizer situation.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.691
<i>I would have had s...</i>

37:44.692 --> 37:45.692
like, extra time on the lamb

37:45.693 --> 37:46.893
to know that it was rare.

37:46.894 --> 37:49.963
I don't think
that's fair to say.

37:49.964 --> 37:51.831
Raw is raw.
If you know raw, you know raw.

37:51.832 --> 37:56.503
If you don't, you don't.

37:56.504 --> 37:58.038
I am so pissed.

37:58.039 --> 37:59.339
No, I don't wanna talk anymore.
I'm done.

37:59.340 --> 38:01.741
I'm not going home for lamb.

38:01.742 --> 38:03.643
W-what's our decision?
Let's go. I'm done.

38:03.644 --> 38:05.879
Honestly,
if that's what sends me home,

38:05.880 --> 38:07.314
then that's ridiculous.

38:07.315 --> 38:08.949
<i>Susan, why are you getting upset?
No, I'm done.</i>

38:08.950 --> 38:09.950
I don't wanna talk anymore.

38:09.951 --> 38:12.052
<i>Susan.
Susan!</i>

38:12.053 --> 38:13.584
<i>Susan!</i>

38:23.664 --> 38:24.664
Okay, Jon.

38:24.665 --> 38:25.899
Yes, chef.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.634
Blue team's first nominee
and why.

38:27.635 --> 38:30.403
Chef, our first nominee
tonight is Jeremy.

38:30.404 --> 38:32.639
He walks slow.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.574
He just doesn't seem
to have the fire.

38:34.575 --> 38:36.476
I helped my whole team get over
a wall by myself, chef.

38:36.477 --> 38:38.878
<i>I don't know how much more fire
they want from me.</i>

38:38.879 --> 38:40.046
Second nominee and why.

38:40.047 --> 38:43.416
Chef, our second nominee
is Christian.

38:43.417 --> 38:45.285
We feel like that was one

38:45.286 --> 38:46.786
of the biggest failing stations
tonight.

38:46.787 --> 38:49.856
<i>And there just seems to be
no sense of urgency.</i>

38:49.857 --> 38:52.492
Ja'nel, red team's
first nominee and why.

38:52.493 --> 38:54.495
Our first nominee...

38:55.830 --> 38:57.897
Is Danielle.

38:57.898 --> 38:59.666
Because even though
we were struggling and having

38:59.667 --> 39:02.068
a hard time,
there wasn't much fight there.

39:02.069 --> 39:03.636
Second nominee and why.

39:03.637 --> 39:05.939
We also nominated...

39:13.365 --> 39:15.099
After a dinner
service so disastrous

39:15.100 --> 39:17.501
that every chef
was kicked out of the kitchen,

39:17.502 --> 39:20.004
both teams
have been asked to nominate

39:20.005 --> 39:21.305
two chefs for elimination.

39:21.306 --> 39:22.873
The women's
first nominee was...

39:22.874 --> 39:24.675
Danielle.

39:24.676 --> 39:25.876
Second nominee and why.

39:25.877 --> 39:28.129
We also nominated...

39:30.215 --> 39:32.116
Mary.

39:32.117 --> 39:34.485
She was struggling as well.

39:34.486 --> 39:36.653
Okay.

39:36.654 --> 39:38.756
Danielle, Mary,

39:38.757 --> 39:41.658
<i>Jeremy, Christian,
step forward.</i>

39:45.730 --> 39:47.064
<i>Mary, why should you stay</i>

39:47.065 --> 39:48.399
<i>in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

39:48.400 --> 39:49.733
I made
a lot of mistakes tonight,

39:49.734 --> 39:52.870
and I realize that,
but I fought back, chef.

39:52.871 --> 39:55.439
I fought back.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.440
Danielle,

39:56.441 --> 39:59.109
<i>still lacking in confidence.</i>

39:59.110 --> 40:00.110
Is it complicated here?

40:00.111 --> 40:01.478
It's just a lot to grasp.

40:01.479 --> 40:03.947
A lot to grasp?

40:03.948 --> 40:06.984
You get stressed before we
even turn the gas on.

40:06.985 --> 40:08.018
<i>Jeremy.</i>

40:08.019 --> 40:09.019
I know my stations.

40:09.020 --> 40:10.087
<i>I understand them.</i>

40:10.088 --> 40:11.422
Chef, to be honest,

40:11.423 --> 40:12.823
I haven't even had a chance
to really cook yet.

40:12.824 --> 40:14.358
Can you get any better?

40:14.359 --> 40:16.460
Of course, chef.
I can always get better.

40:16.461 --> 40:17.928
Christian.

40:17.929 --> 40:20.064
I think I brought
the whole team down,

40:20.065 --> 40:21.498
<i>but I have a lot more in me.</i>

40:21.499 --> 40:22.599
I have the heart, chef.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.600
I'm willing to learn

40:23.601 --> 40:26.570
and try my ass off
for you, chef.

40:26.571 --> 40:29.406
Okay.

40:29.407 --> 40:30.407
My decision is...

40:33.711 --> 40:35.579
Danielle.

40:35.580 --> 40:37.781
Jeremy.

40:37.782 --> 40:39.850
Back in line, both of you.

40:39.851 --> 40:42.295
You're kidding.

40:44.556 --> 40:47.658
Mary.

40:47.659 --> 40:48.659
How much wine
did you put in there?

40:48.660 --> 40:51.128
I put in
just a few squirts, chef.

40:51.129 --> 40:53.330
So you have to reduce it down!

40:53.331 --> 40:55.032
Christian.

40:55.033 --> 40:56.433
Christian!

40:56.434 --> 40:57.434
Yes, chef.

40:57.435 --> 40:59.403
He brings up scallops.

40:59.404 --> 41:02.739
rubber.

41:02.740 --> 41:03.974
<i>The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:03.975 --> 41:05.575
♪

41:11.233 --> 41:13.083
Christian.
Give me your jacket, big boy.

41:13.084 --> 41:15.586
<i>Your time is done.</i>

41:22.293 --> 41:23.927
Hey, I'm a Boston guy.

41:23.928 --> 41:25.295
I had my bill Buckner moment.

41:25.296 --> 41:26.597
I froze at a big time,

41:26.598 --> 41:28.265
but I didn't get
my second chance to fight,

41:28.266 --> 41:29.566
which really pissed me off.

41:29.567 --> 41:31.034
Chef Ramsay made a big mistake

41:31.035 --> 41:34.705
by getting rid
of this Boston guy.

41:34.706 --> 41:35.772
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

41:35.773 --> 41:38.142
is all about fighting back.

41:38.143 --> 41:39.276
Got it?

41:39.277 --> 41:40.444
Yes, chef!

41:40.445 --> 41:42.045
Get out of here.

41:42.046 --> 41:44.014
Jeremy.

41:44.015 --> 41:48.952
Stay there.

41:48.953 --> 41:50.587
What the is going on?

41:50.588 --> 41:52.122
We're down two people.

41:52.123 --> 41:55.058
We can't lose anyone else.

41:55.059 --> 41:56.760
Chef Ramsay calls out Jeremy,

41:56.761 --> 41:58.228
and I'm like, who cares?

41:58.229 --> 42:00.635
I'm ready for him to go home.

42:01.866 --> 42:04.701
Come here, you.

42:10.375 --> 42:12.876
<i>Next time on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:12.877 --> 42:13.944
Wake up!

42:13.945 --> 42:16.613
Hurry up,
you dimwit, Mary!

42:16.614 --> 42:18.015
All hell breaks loose.

42:18.016 --> 42:19.716
It's not good enough!

42:19.717 --> 42:22.653
And one chef
heads for the hills.

42:22.654 --> 42:23.654
Where is Mary?

42:23.655 --> 42:24.721
<i>No one knows where she is</i>

42:24.722 --> 42:27.124
<i>or if she's coming back.</i>

42:27.125 --> 42:28.792
She is screwing us royally
right now.

42:28.793 --> 42:30.227
In the men's kitchen...

42:30.228 --> 42:31.261
Where is it?

42:31.262 --> 42:32.262
A simple question...

42:32.263 --> 42:33.997
You just looked
at the lamb.

42:33.998 --> 42:34.998
How... Move.

42:34.999 --> 42:35.999
Leads to a fight...

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
yelling at me.

42:37.001 --> 42:38.602
Of epic proportions.

42:38.603 --> 42:39.836
bump into me again.

42:39.837 --> 42:42.039
Don't bump me.
You ain't .

42:42.040 --> 42:43.507
You wanna fight?
Come get it!

42:43.508 --> 42:44.675
Get the out of here.

42:44.676 --> 42:45.842
<i>!</i>

42:45.843 --> 42:47.144
Next time on a law-breaking...

42:47.145 --> 42:48.845
I don't care if I
go to jail tonight.

42:48.846 --> 42:49.846
What the ?

42:49.847 --> 42:51.148
Door-slamming...

42:51.149 --> 42:52.149
What?

42:52.150 --> 42:53.317
Get the out
and go home!

42:53.318 --> 42:56.085
