00:13.214 --> 00:15.383
Case log A275.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.119
21st and Johnson,
corner grocery.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.222
Betty Hogenson.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.023
Turning down aisle nine.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.860
Approaching in five, four,

00:26.960 --> 00:29.563
three, two...

00:29.663 --> 00:31.132
Ooh, hi.
Sorry. Sorry.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.866
Uh, the, uh--

00:32.966 --> 00:34.802
Behind you, up there.
The Oat Mix Plus.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.171
Can you grab me
one of those, please?

00:37.271 --> 00:38.172
Sure.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.643
Thank you very much.
You've been assessed

00:42.743 --> 00:44.878
and photographed
for OreMark Cross insurance.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.014
My name is Todd Wright,
and I'm assigned your case. Wait.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.617
What's going on?
Are you a lawyer?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.585
Uh, no. Private detective.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.388
Well, I was.
Now I'm doing this.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.390
You are not wearing
your neck brace,

00:56.490 --> 00:57.758
you are clearly fine,

00:57.858 --> 00:59.026
but you are still
collecting disability

00:59.127 --> 01:00.794
from your employer,
the Portland Airport,

01:00.894 --> 01:03.631
where you were injured
while vacuuming?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.399
I really need that money.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.535
I'm sorry, it's just my job.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.669
I need money, too.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.504
Okay?
Mom?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.174
Can we get these
with the SNAP card?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.509
Please, Mommy?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.844
Please.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.614
All right. Delete photos.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.151
But you have to go back
to work at the airport.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.418
Soon. Okay?

01:24.518 --> 01:26.320
And wear your neck brace.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.956
Yes, I will.
Thank you.

01:29.056 --> 01:31.024
And don't get that cereal, okay?
It rots your teeth.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.461
And the prizes inside
are total junk.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.299
Look, if you don't pay
some sort of rent,

01:38.399 --> 01:40.701
I'm gonna get grief from Mom.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.603
This is how you
put away the hose?

01:42.703 --> 01:43.671
It's coiled.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.173
And why is a tiny little room

01:45.206 --> 01:46.774
in your garage her concern?

01:46.874 --> 01:49.377
She doesn't want you freeloading
off of Chuck and me.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.980
Yeah, that's why
I'm paying rent.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.750
Or why I will.
Next week, half.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.186
A third.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.356
Mom. Hello.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.557
Put your brother on the phone.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.958
No. Allison,
say I'm not here. I...

02:05.058 --> 02:06.394
You're here.
Hello. What? Hi.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.661
I'm not speaking to you.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.096
You are coming
to my new condo tonight,

02:09.197 --> 02:11.632
and you are picking up
all the boxes of crap

02:11.732 --> 02:13.201
that you left in your old room

02:13.301 --> 02:15.669
that I have now paid good money
to haul across the city.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.305
Yeah, tonight's not great, actually,

02:17.405 --> 02:18.772
and as you well know,
I don't have

02:18.872 --> 02:20.274
a lot of room over here.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.476
You can jam some stuff
in our basement.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.977
No, no, no, no, no, Todd,

02:24.077 --> 02:25.813
you are not turning
Allison's house into a dump,

02:25.913 --> 02:27.215
like you did mine.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.850
I turned your home into a dump
with three boxes?

02:29.950 --> 02:32.386
It is four boxes, and your
sister and her husband

02:32.486 --> 02:33.854
have done enough for you already.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.423
Good God, Todd!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.791
Careening through life,
making the rest of us

02:37.891 --> 02:39.092
pick up the pieces.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.862
You still owe me $9,000.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.631
Mom, you hit
the FaceTime button.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.932
I did not.
I can hear you perfectly.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.801
Yes, and I can see you.
You're on video.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.238
No, I am... Oh.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.739
Well, okay.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.708
I need for you
to put together a plan

02:54.808 --> 02:58.011
to live an adult,
financially solvent life.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.281
Great. And I think that plan
begins with not talking to you

03:00.381 --> 03:01.882
when things are
super crappy for me.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.484
God, I lost my job.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.253
Two years ago.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.588
And that is a mess
you walked right into.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.156
How is this helpful?

03:09.257 --> 03:11.359
A-And should you really
be FaceTiming while driving?

03:11.459 --> 03:13.794
I am in the parking lot
of Best Buy,

03:13.894 --> 03:15.729
picking up my new
television set.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.265
Oh, congrats.
Must be nice.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.899
Guess you don't really need
that $9,000 back, huh?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.534
Good God.
I have to get to work,

03:20.634 --> 03:23.804
but you will pick up
your boxes tonight.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.358
I didn't kill him.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.593
Let's prove that to the jury.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.964
And Kim's ankle monitor
will be updated

04:57.064 --> 04:58.632
so she can go to court Monday. Okay.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.634
Good God.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.202
Nadia should be
working from home.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.637
She's still looking
for witnesses

05:18.386 --> 05:22.122
Uh, I'm paying you back.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.925
I could give you $1,000
a month for nine months,

05:25.025 --> 05:27.194
but don't cash it until...

05:28.028 --> 05:29.497
Mom?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.401
Mom, are you okay?

05:33.501 --> 05:35.102
Harry has...

05:35.202 --> 05:39.072
I think Harry has...

05:40.874 --> 05:42.610
I came here after work,

05:42.710 --> 05:44.412
and he wasn't here.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.980
And I thought maybe he was
back at the old house

05:47.080 --> 05:47.981
with the movers.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.851
But he-he never came.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.319
It's 10:00.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.821
Okay, well, maybe he's
been in a car accident.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.490
We should call the police.
He disconnected his phone.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.792
And I got to looking around,
and, um,

05:58.892 --> 06:03.163
the only thing that he took
was a small suitcase

06:03.263 --> 06:05.966
and his laptop and--

06:06.066 --> 06:07.501
Oh, my God.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.637
That-- All-- He's taken
all of his pills.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.005
That box was full
of his medications.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.842
Wait. What medications?

06:15.643 --> 06:16.744
Did you know that Harry

06:16.844 --> 06:18.045
has Parkinson's disease?

06:18.145 --> 06:19.647
Yes, I knew.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.148
What do you mean "disappeared"?

06:21.248 --> 06:23.016
He's disconnected his phone.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.985
Wait, you knew?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.520
You knew, and I didn't?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.355
You have been fighting with Mom
for two years.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.691
How long has he been gone?
Uh...

06:30.791 --> 06:33.226
Five or six hours.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.562
Todd...

06:34.662 --> 06:36.163
Harry's father killed himself.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.199
Like, 20 years ago, he was
diagnosed with brain cancer,

06:39.299 --> 06:40.734
and he couldn't deal with it,
so he...

06:40.834 --> 06:42.803
he jumped off
the Fremont Bridge.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.572
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Wright to the ICU.
Dr. Wright to the ICU.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.474
Todd, I'm sorry,
I-I'm being paged.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.241
I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

06:52.079 --> 06:52.980
Okay, no.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.082
This isn't happening.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.317
This is crazy. This is bananas.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.219
He's not just gonna
disappear on you.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.922
Todd, Harry might've
gone off to...

07:02.022 --> 07:04.892
No, no, no, no. Wh-Wh-Why take
a-all of your medications

07:04.992 --> 07:06.627
if your plan is to off yourself?
And his laptop?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.161
No, no.
This isn't that.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.564
Okay? This is something else,
and we're not gonna

07:10.664 --> 07:12.132
let him get away with it.
I'm not.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.501
All right,
uh, okay.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.303
D-Does he have a credit card
that's just his?

07:16.403 --> 07:19.106
I-I need, I need a receipt
for something that he bought.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.508
The new TV.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.943
Maybe the receipt
is taped up there on the top.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.045
3752. Okay, that's an Amex card.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.015
Uh, call American Express
from my address book.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.750
Call Amex late payment department.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.051
No, no, no, no.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.553
Just call regular
Amex customer service.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.354
What?

07:34.522 --> 07:35.956
Okay, I need

07:36.056 --> 07:37.725
Harry's social
security number...

07:37.825 --> 07:39.860
...date and city of birth,
and mother's maiden name.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.061
Just write it down.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.596
Right here, right now. Go.
Okay. Okay.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.997
Good evening. American Express.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.734
Oh, yes, hi, hello,
good evening. This is

07:46.834 --> 07:48.301
Harry McDonald,
and I just need

07:48.401 --> 07:50.070
some information
about my recent purchases.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.072
Todd, this is illegal.
Just a moment, sir.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.173
This is identity theft.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.542
Want me to play by the rules,

07:54.575 --> 07:55.643
or you want me
to find your husband?

07:55.743 --> 07:57.010
Oh. Hello?

07:57.110 --> 08:01.014
Mom...
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't talk ri...

08:01.114 --> 08:02.415
What? Oh.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.652
My investigator Nadia,
her water broke.

08:04.752 --> 08:05.786
Mom, get off the phone.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.155
Oh, uh, uh, uh,
I-I-I-- No.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.291
Just, whatever info you have,
email it to my phone,

08:11.391 --> 08:13.193
and I...
You don't have to say,
"Email it to your phone."

08:13.293 --> 08:14.895
If you get email on your phone,
it just goes to your phone.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.463
Mr. McDonald,

08:16.564 --> 08:17.965
I'll need your birthdate

08:18.065 --> 08:19.967
and your mother's
maiden name to continue.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.903
Uh, yes, oh, yes, of course.
Uh, 8/21/59

08:23.003 --> 08:25.305
and, uh, Bottlethwaite.
And it looks like

08:25.405 --> 08:27.908
you've recently moved
and changed your

08:28.008 --> 08:30.678
home address to the one
in Gresham.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.747
Um... no, I did not
move to Gresham.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.283
That's... 45 minutes
from here.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.685
What address
do you have?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.086
I'm sorry, I can't give you

08:39.186 --> 08:40.120
that information.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.589
Unless...

08:41.689 --> 08:42.990
...you can verify that you are,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.257
in fact, Harry McDonald.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.093
Yes, damn it,
I am Harry McDonald.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.460

08:50.664 --> 08:52.966
And I just bought
a TV from Best Buy

08:53.066 --> 08:56.670
for... $1,347.
What the hell am I doing?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.906
Mr. McDonald, the address I have

08:59.006 --> 09:01.474
for you is 1683

09:01.609 --> 09:03.376
South East Carnola Way,

09:03.476 --> 09:06.346
Gresham, 97030.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.616
But now I'll need to bring on
a security adv...

09:08.682 --> 09:10.283
Todd.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.921
Don't hang up. Now they might
contact the police or something.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.322
Great. Let them.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.658
Harry is missing.
The police can help us find him.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.293
But then... what do we do now?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.396
Now, we drive to Gresham

09:23.496 --> 09:25.298
to find your husband.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.142
It's empty.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.111
Looked in all the windows.
No furniture, nothing.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.913
I could probably pick
the lock in back, but... No.

09:40.013 --> 09:43.784
Todd, no. That's criminal.
Six months minimum.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.220
While you were gone,

09:47.320 --> 09:48.656
I was picturing him
in there.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.091
What if he hung himself
in that garage?

09:51.191 --> 09:54.194
Like Bradley Coopman
in that Madonna movie,

09:54.294 --> 09:55.195
<i>Starborn.</i>

09:55.295 --> 09:58.031
Like Bradley Cooper

09:58.131 --> 10:00.934
in the Lady Gaga movie
<i>A Star Is Born?</i>

10:01.034 --> 10:02.903
And why would he
send his bills

10:03.003 --> 10:06.039
to a house where he's dead?
That doesn't make any sense.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.777
It's Allison.
Don't answer that.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.345
I don't want anyone in the
family to know what's going on.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.781
You know
I'm in the family, right?

10:13.881 --> 10:16.016
Hang up. Fine.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.085
So, what do we do now?

10:18.185 --> 10:19.920
Sit here? Waiting?

10:20.020 --> 10:23.290
We have no other leads,
he is linked to this house,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.993
and he has to sleep
somewhere tonight.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.103
This is insane.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.237
I mean, this seat

10:37.337 --> 10:39.072
is filthy.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.274
What is all this junk
down here at my feet?

10:41.374 --> 10:42.743
Is that a telescope?

10:42.843 --> 10:45.612
It's a lens for
a camera, a long lens.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.180
Todd, without your license,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.149
you are not allowed to work
as a private detective

10:49.249 --> 10:51.051
in the state of...
Yes, I know that.
Thank you very much, Mother.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.853
I am just finding people
and taking photos

10:52.953 --> 10:56.056
for health insurance companies,
okay? Pays the bills.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.325
Almost.
Well, I had hoped

10:58.425 --> 11:00.928
that you would get out
of this field altogether,

11:01.028 --> 11:03.731
considering the amount of
trouble you got yourself into.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.398
Mom, I am a private detective.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.734
You were.
It is all I've

11:06.800 --> 11:08.401
ever wanted to be.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.637
You gave me that copy of <i>Harriet
the Spy</i> when I was nine,

11:10.738 --> 11:12.172
and I am very, very good
at this job.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.807
Well...
And if it weren't for me,

11:13.907 --> 11:15.809
you would still be
in your empty condo alone

11:15.909 --> 11:17.510
with no idea where
your husband is.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.580
As opposed to
where we are,

11:20.748 --> 11:21.882
which is nowhere.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.896
Who was having a baby
on the phone?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.430
Oh, that's Nadia.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.400
She's the investigator
on my current case. Oh.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.236
You remember my
sorority sister Celia?
No.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.404
And her daughter Kim.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.273
No.
Todd, Kim.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.775
We tried to set you up
with her once,

11:47.875 --> 11:48.776
but she thought you were weird.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.811
She has now
been accused

11:50.911 --> 11:52.913
of murdering her boss.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.448
Oh. Oh, great.
That's nice.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.950
He sexually assaulted her

11:57.050 --> 11:59.186
at the office Christmas party.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.888
Oh.
Anyway,

12:00.988 --> 12:03.556
the boss leaves the party
a few hours later,

12:03.656 --> 12:05.558
goes to the rooftop

12:05.658 --> 12:07.227
of a nearby parking garage,

12:07.327 --> 12:11.064
and is shot to death
sitting in his car.

12:11.164 --> 12:11.932
Oh.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.001
But she didn't do it?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.636
No forensic evidence,
no gunpowder, nothing.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.306
Though she did own a gun once.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.674
Oh.
But she lost it
two years ago when

12:21.809 --> 12:23.043
she moved back in
with her parents.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.578
In any event, we're trying
to nail down witnesses

12:25.678 --> 12:26.914
who saw her on the bus

12:27.014 --> 12:28.916
before the trial resumes
on Monday.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.383
Resumes?
Yes.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.653
The state prosecutor fell
down the stairs in his home

12:33.821 --> 12:35.856
and gave himself
a serious concussion.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.225
So the judge granted them
a two-week continuance.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.827
He has a serious concussion

12:39.927 --> 12:40.961
and he's coming back to work

12:41.061 --> 12:42.295
in two weeks?
Yes.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.563
I've tracked down
a few concussed people,

12:43.663 --> 12:44.998
and if you've really got one,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.934
you're on strict bed rest
for a month, minimum.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.869
So the state prosecutor
is a liar.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.938
What's the name of
this concussion guy?

12:51.038 --> 12:52.840
Christopher Barrett.
Christopher Barrett.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.741
Wait, so you're gonna look him
up on your phone. Wonderful.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.877
Your generation is addicted
to your devices.
Mr. Barrett. Oh.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.645
His daughter...
Try to solve everything
through apps, and...

12:58.745 --> 12:59.947
Who has a TikTok,
of course.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.182
...then beepMo and podcasts.
Uh-huh.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.051
Oh. Oh, yes. There.
Oh, God,

13:04.151 --> 13:05.886
I cannot keep my eyes open.
Oh, hello,

13:05.986 --> 13:07.754
Mr. Serious Concussion Man.
How do you ignore
the odor in this car?

13:07.855 --> 13:09.022
Mom, take a look at this.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.758
What is this?
What is she doing?

13:11.859 --> 13:13.961
Is that Tok-Tok?

13:15.762 --> 13:16.864
Is that him?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.598
That's him exercising,
what's that,

13:18.698 --> 13:20.600
six, seven,
eight days ago?

13:20.700 --> 13:22.035
Looks fine to me.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.104
But then, this is a lie.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.606
If he is not injured,

13:26.706 --> 13:29.176
then they are stalling.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.979
They are waiting for
a piece of evidence

13:32.079 --> 13:34.181
that they don't have,
so that they--

13:34.281 --> 13:36.283
We have to get down
to the courthouse right now.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.186
Start the car. Oh, my God,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.620
Oh, God, but then
who's gonna stay here

13:40.720 --> 13:41.989
to watch the house
for Harry?

13:42.089 --> 13:43.223
Here, hold this.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.225
These burners could
be our eyes.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.461
Disposable phones, Mom.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.271
<i>This place is closed.</i>

13:58.371 --> 13:59.472
But by law,

13:59.572 --> 14:00.908
the records room
has to be attended

14:00.974 --> 14:02.375
24 hours a day,

14:02.475 --> 14:05.078
and, if you play
your cards right,

14:05.178 --> 14:07.948
you just might get in there.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.616
Damn it.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.751
Okay, you stay here,
I'll go around front.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.321
Can I help you?

14:14.421 --> 14:18.091
Uh, yes.
I am Inspector Clip

14:18.191 --> 14:19.659
with the Portland Gas Company,

14:19.759 --> 14:21.728
and someone has reported a leak
in the records room,

14:21.828 --> 14:24.631
so I just need access to that
so I can check on it.

14:24.731 --> 14:25.933
A gas leak?

14:26.033 --> 14:27.167
Mm-hmm.
Todd.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.769
What are you doing?

14:29.937 --> 14:32.205
How are you, Jenny dear?
Hi.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.274
The, uh, new guard let me in.
Uh-huh.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.575
Edgar.
Mm-hmm.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.377
Will you please let us
into the records room?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.946
I have a pressing matter.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.714
And this is my son Todd.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.351
Hi.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.056
I must have spent years
of my life down here

14:49.156 --> 14:50.523
filing and sorting briefs.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.326
Once I passed the bar,
I got my nails done

14:53.426 --> 14:56.096
and swore I'd never break
another one pulling files.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.764
Ah, found it.
Right here.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.299
Okay, bring it.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.068
All right,
so this is my case.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.536
Now, I want you to flip to
the evidence log in the back.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.405
How many pieces of evidence
have been logged and tagged?

15:05.505 --> 15:07.374
It's the back flap,
yes? Red box.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.976
Nine.
Nine, okay, same here.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.310
Maybe not new evidence.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.313
Try the front flap, gray box.
How many witnesses?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.315
Witnesses... 15.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.984
Fifteen or 50?
Fifteen.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.851
One, five. Fifteen. Okay.

15:18.986 --> 15:22.189
13, 14, 15.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.491
Sixteen.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.559
They're introducing
a new witness.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.495
Isn't that something
that happens?
Yes.

15:28.595 --> 15:33.000
But they're required to file
weeks in advance, and inform me.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.668
Witness OA1--

15:35.768 --> 15:39.606
They must have found someone
after the start of the trial,

15:39.706 --> 15:42.242
and they're filing in secret
because they don't want me

15:42.342 --> 15:44.311
to find out and block it.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.179
So, like, someone who
saw her kill him.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.580
She didn't kill him, Todd.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.649
Okay, someone who thinks
they saw her kill him.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.718
Witness OA16.

15:51.818 --> 15:55.555
"Witness in possession of
a Vex800-MP9." What is...

15:55.655 --> 15:58.291
MP9 is a kind of
digital video file.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.660
Like, from a security camera.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.696
So they have a new
witness who has a video

16:03.796 --> 16:05.698
of something bad for you.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.868
Something bad enough
to make them fake an injury

16:09.036 --> 16:09.902
and slow down the case.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.338
Are you sure
she didn't kill him?

16:12.905 --> 16:14.541
Todd-- Wait, Todd.
What did you touch?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.343
That's not me. I don't--
Oh, wait, no, that's my phone.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.511
It's the burners.
The cameras that we left.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.647
There's activity
at that house.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.583
Who was that?
Was that Harry?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.952
He's locking the door.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.289
What does he have
in his hands?

16:29.389 --> 16:30.590
What is that?
It's a baby.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.060
That's not Harry.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.395
Who the hell was that?

16:39.832 --> 16:43.370
Our in-house investigator, Lyle,
who is remarkably precise,

16:43.470 --> 16:44.871
is right down there.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.474
He can get you access
to the RMLS website,

16:47.574 --> 16:49.876
and maybe you can find out
more about...

16:49.976 --> 16:52.345
that house that Harry...

16:52.445 --> 16:53.513
In Gresham.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.248
Mom, it's okay.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.284
I'll find him,
I promise.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.220
No, no. I am fine.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.788
Kim will be here
any minute,

17:01.888 --> 17:04.991
and I do not let my personal
life interfere with my work.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.659
♪ The way I'm slippin' away ♪

17:06.759 --> 17:09.329

17:09.429 --> 17:10.963

17:13.466 --> 17:15.268
Ooh.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.970
♪ And you wasn't polite... ♪

17:18.105 --> 17:19.806
Hey, are you Lyle?

17:19.906 --> 17:22.975
I need access to the RMLS
property info database.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.911
And you are?

17:25.011 --> 17:27.914
Todd. Wright.

17:28.014 --> 17:31.518
My mother Margaret Wright
is a partner here, so

17:31.618 --> 17:34.454
she's basically your boss.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.223
Your mother is not my boss.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.790
I'm an employee
of the firm,

17:37.890 --> 17:39.859
answering only to the bylaws
of the corporation.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.561
None of us share
investigative database access

17:41.661 --> 17:42.862
with nonemployees.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.897
Okay.
Nor with former investigators

17:44.997 --> 17:47.434
stripped of their licenses
following criminal charges

17:47.534 --> 17:49.469
for illegal wiretapping
and forgery.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.704
I had nothing to do
with the forgery.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.606
Oh, I remember your defense.

17:53.706 --> 17:57.244
You were seduced and deceived
by your mentor.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.411
You thought you were
equal partners

17:58.511 --> 17:59.746
in your little
detective agency,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.814
and you had no idea
she was making you

18:01.914 --> 18:03.750
the fall guy
for her criminal activities.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.885
Yeah. That's right.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.155
Well, your mother could
keep you out of jail,

18:08.221 --> 18:10.190
but she can't force you
in my office.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.824
Good day. Look,

18:11.924 --> 18:13.526
I just need information
about a house.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.162
It's personal,
for my mom.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.763
Personal searches are
strictly forbidden.

18:16.863 --> 18:21.234
And so is eating in my office.
Crumbs. Get out!

18:32.179 --> 18:35.282
Oh, my God. Todd.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.517
Hi.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.520
Susan. Hi.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.723
You work for my mother?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.525
I work <i>with</i> your mother.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.494
Wow, I haven't seen you
since we...

18:47.594 --> 18:49.028
We? Since you.
I mean, I didn't...

18:49.196 --> 18:50.397
Okay, since I...
I would never.
You were the...

18:50.497 --> 18:51.398
Well, it ended.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.533
I didn't...

18:53.633 --> 18:54.634
You're married.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.204
Oh, engaged, just last month.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.838
Peter.
Peter. Cool.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.940
You know, I have to tell you
that your mom is

19:01.040 --> 19:02.309
such a wonderful woman.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.844
She's so encouraging
and supportive.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.247
Uh, okay.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.016
Hey, listen,

19:10.116 --> 19:12.252
maybe you'd be willing to do
my mother a little favor.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.888
You see, uh, there's
this house in Gresham...

19:15.988 --> 19:17.557
<i>Kim is my girlfriend.</i>

19:17.657 --> 19:19.125
Her house arrest
should be at my place.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.893
She says you just cry
and he's yelling all day.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.395
Who the hell do you
think you are?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.663
She's my daughter,
damn it.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.465
Can both
of you please

19:25.565 --> 19:26.499
stop fighting?

19:26.599 --> 19:27.800
Walter, Niki,

19:27.900 --> 19:28.968
go somewhere else, please.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.370
They're just upset.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.938
Just don't say anything.
Come with me.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.474
Just relax, Kim, relax.

19:35.842 --> 19:36.809
It's all gonna be fine,

19:36.909 --> 19:37.877
I promise you.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.247
Take a deep breath, all right?

19:51.624 --> 19:54.060
Just, uh...

19:55.528 --> 19:57.063
I only wanted to protect her.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.532
And that is our secret, okay?

19:59.632 --> 20:02.201
If anyone can get her off,
it's this bitch lawyer

20:02.302 --> 20:03.303
that Celia hired.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.203
Just keep it...

20:04.304 --> 20:05.538
Good morning.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.607
I want to thank you all
for coming back in

20:07.707 --> 20:09.676
on such short notice.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.879
I have discovered
that the prosecution

20:12.979 --> 20:14.281
has a new witness.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.048
:
And this witness may possess

20:16.148 --> 20:18.918
security camera footage
that incriminates Kim.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.288
Now, Kim, we've been
through this many times,

20:21.388 --> 20:23.990
but when you left the party,
did you go

20:24.090 --> 20:25.425
straight to the bus stop,

20:25.525 --> 20:28.628
or did you go into
or near any buildings?
No.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.963
She was home by 12:30, Mar.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.098
I heard her come in.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.901
Is there any chance
anyone saw you

20:35.001 --> 20:36.235
with a gun that night?

20:36.336 --> 20:38.871
I know you lost your gun...
Two years ago.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.641
:
My God, what is going on here?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.843
I am the victim, not him.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.177
Oh, here you are.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.213
Hi.
Hi. I got the info
that you wanted.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.982
That house is a rental owned by
Lodging and Rental Incorporated.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.084
Thank you.
That's their info.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.654
Is it really for your mom?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.423
Yeah.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.490
Mm.
Absolutely.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.891
No, no, I'm helping her...

20:58.991 --> 21:00.427
You just needed me to get
around Lyle, didn't you?

21:00.527 --> 21:03.530
Yeah, just kind of put me in
an awkward position with him.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.565
Well, I'm sorry, I...

21:05.665 --> 21:06.999
I lost my PI license,

21:07.099 --> 21:09.035
and I can't run my own
municipal searches.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.340
But you like to...

21:13.440 --> 21:15.342
Play by the rules. Yeah.
Right. And I'm...

21:15.442 --> 21:17.710
Oh, uh, no, no, no,
don't, don't.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.346
I'm not, uh, that's...

21:19.446 --> 21:20.947
That's not--
I'm not, um...

21:21.047 --> 21:22.682
Can I just...
I'm sorry.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.919
Thank you. No. No, thank you.
I'm just gonna
go back to... Bye.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.356
Susan, wait.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.033
Hey, Mom, I got the info
on that Gresham house.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.203
Oh.
The man we saw, "Tomas,"
is the landlord.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.706
He lives down the street.
He's married to Rosa,

21:46.806 --> 21:49.676
and I found her on Instagram
holding their newborn baby.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.243
So he was probably
out for a walk

21:51.378 --> 21:53.212
trying to get the baby
back to sleep. Yeah.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.981
And maybe dropping
off something

21:55.081 --> 21:56.416
for his new tenant, Harry.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.385
Anyway, I just left
a voice mail for Tomas.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.721
And by the way, I noticed
that you have photos

22:01.821 --> 22:04.657
of Allison and Lawrence
on your desk, but none of me.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.058
So thank you.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.760
Todd, those are your
siblings' wedding photos.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.396
Get married and I'll be
glad to include you.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.664
Allison has called me four times

22:11.764 --> 22:12.899
since I was in my meeting.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.000
I wonder what's going on.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.636
Oh, well, she knows.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.938
I told her about Harry
before you told me

22:19.038 --> 22:20.172
not to tell anybody.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.675
Anyway, she would like
both of us

22:22.775 --> 22:24.544
to come over for dinner tonight.

22:24.644 --> 22:28.014
She invited you
for family dinner?

22:28.981 --> 22:32.519
Oh, hi, Mom.
Chuck, they're here.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.954
Mom, I'm--
I don't even know what to say.
I know.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.889
Come on in,
please, please, please.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.726
Yeah.
Hey. So Harry just disappeared
in the night

22:39.826 --> 22:40.993
to go kill himself?

22:41.093 --> 22:43.863
:
Chuck. What are you doing?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.131
It was just
a question.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.332
Why would you say that?
Coat, please.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.934
No, I don't need a hug. Um...

22:48.034 --> 22:49.836
Why would you say that? Todd,
would you shut the door, please?

22:49.936 --> 22:51.771
Why are you giving this to me?
Oh. Wait. Actually, no, don't.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.440
Hi, Chet.
Perfect timing. Hey.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.642
I'm just gonna
murder everybody. Oh.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.610
Where's your invisible
husband Lawrence?

22:57.710 --> 22:58.945
Well, he can't make it.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.080
Your brother's
a busy guy.
To be expected.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.449
Your daddy's working?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.551
And this daddy needs a beer.

23:04.651 --> 23:05.852
Okay. I just...

23:05.952 --> 23:07.454
Todd, shut the door.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.789
I'm holding a human being.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.691
<i>You've been having
family dinner without me?</i>

23:11.791 --> 23:12.959
Without Uncle Todd?

23:13.059 --> 23:14.694
Every week?
You dinner? No me?

23:14.794 --> 23:16.663
Mom, again, Chuck and I
are so sorry

23:16.763 --> 23:19.265
to hear this crazy,
awful news.

23:19.365 --> 23:22.201
And we will do whatever we can
to support you.

23:22.301 --> 23:23.670
Allison, thank you.

23:23.770 --> 23:27.039
Um, it is nice to have
my whole family together

23:27.139 --> 23:28.475
at this time.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.711
Well, almost whole.
Uh, is your brother com--

23:31.811 --> 23:33.179
Chet, is Lawrence coming?

23:33.279 --> 23:35.482
No. Unfortunately, he's still
stuck in Hood River

23:35.515 --> 23:36.949
dealing with the flood.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.951
Oh, of course, of course.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.153
His job is very important.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.955
He is the chief

23:43.055 --> 23:44.891
of staff for
the governor of Oregon.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.528
Allison, is this the only
wine that we have?

23:48.628 --> 23:49.962
What about that nice
bottle of cabernet

23:50.062 --> 23:52.198
I bought you
for Chuck's birthday?
Oh, yeah.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.867
I think we still have that.
Oh, and, um,

23:54.967 --> 23:56.302
maybe some nicer napkins.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.871
These ones are so thin.
Sure. Of course.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.172
Chuck, would you get the wine?

24:00.272 --> 24:02.975
But it's my cabernet.
Chuck, please?

24:03.075 --> 24:05.177
Okay.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.679
Thank you.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.515
And how is Celia's case doing?

24:08.615 --> 24:10.783
I mean her daughter; the one
who thought Todd was weird.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.519
Oh, Kim.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.821
Well, the prosecution
is playing very dirty.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.256
They are trying to slide
a surprise witness

24:17.356 --> 24:19.526
into the entire...
Niki and the dad,

24:19.559 --> 24:21.060
they have solid alibis, right?

24:21.160 --> 24:22.394
Yes, Todd.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.531
And they are not suspects. Okay.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.266
And what were they?
Their alibis?

24:27.366 --> 24:28.735
What are you so suspicious of?

24:28.835 --> 24:31.938
I just don't trust
this Niki person.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.105
Or the dad.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.641
They were acting
really weird today,

24:34.741 --> 24:36.142
and frankly, I don't like
how they were talking about Mom.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.844
When were they talking
about me?

24:37.944 --> 24:39.211
Well, before the meeting,
they were huddled up

24:39.311 --> 24:41.280
and talking about
protecting Kim

24:41.380 --> 24:42.549
and their secret,

24:42.582 --> 24:44.083
and he called you a...

24:44.183 --> 24:46.052
And how do you know this?

24:46.152 --> 24:49.388
My phone ended up in the--

24:49.556 --> 24:50.923
I heard them, okay?

24:51.023 --> 24:52.291
It was just a little
digital eavesdropping, and...

24:52.391 --> 24:53.560
You were recording

24:53.660 --> 24:55.061
my clients'
private conversation?

24:55.161 --> 24:56.963
No, I wasn't recording them,
but I should have.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.364
Didn't your business partner...
But it's no big deal.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.732
...go to jail for this?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.634
I was collecting
information for <i>you.</i>

25:01.734 --> 25:03.603
Todd!
I think I'm gonna
take Clem upstairs.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.104
I think we should finish
this in the living room.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.238
How could you be so stupid?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.740
You were spying on--

25:07.840 --> 25:09.976
After everything
I've done for you.
Oh, come on.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.478
I lent you money,
I have defended you in court,

25:12.579 --> 25:14.647
and yet you are hellbent
on destroying yourself.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.783
No, I'm not. What is this,
a German opera?

25:16.883 --> 25:18.450
God, I have been
by your side

25:18.585 --> 25:20.720
for two whole days
while Allison's at work.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.189
And Lawrence isn't even here,
but I am.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.693
I am here for you
in your time of need.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.595
Even though you didn't quite
do the same for me

25:28.661 --> 25:30.462
when Dad died, did you?

25:31.397 --> 25:32.965
Excuse me?

25:33.065 --> 25:34.500
"I don't let my personal life
get in the way of my work."

25:34.601 --> 25:36.603
Yeah, very clear.
Very clear.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.105
Dad dies, suddenly poof, gone.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.107
They're off in college
and I'm at home, alone,

25:41.207 --> 25:43.409
while you're, what,
taking the bar exam,

25:43.509 --> 25:45.211
breaking nails in
the courthouse basement?

25:45.311 --> 25:46.746
And now you're all,
"What's wrong with you?

25:46.846 --> 25:48.915
Why is your life
always a mess?"

25:49.015 --> 25:50.983
I mean, seriously, honestly,
back then,

25:51.083 --> 25:53.519
it was like both
my parents had died.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.734
It just came out.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.774
:
Hi, my name is Tomas Garcia,

26:14.874 --> 26:16.676
and I'm returning a call

26:16.776 --> 26:19.145
to Todd Wingo of the FBI.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.513
I really don't want
any trouble.

26:21.648 --> 26:24.350
You asked about Harry McDonald,

26:24.450 --> 26:26.152
but I don't know who that is.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.756
We do have a rental in Gresham,
but our new tenant is not him.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.891
Our new tenant is
actually a magician,

26:31.991 --> 26:34.126
Morris the Magnificent.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.662
A magician?

26:39.331 --> 26:40.532
<i>So this magician has a shop?</i>

26:40.667 --> 26:41.734
<i>Apparently.</i>

26:41.834 --> 26:42.835
Thank you for driving me.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.937
My car just needs
a new engine.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.305
Why are you still
looking for Harry

26:46.405 --> 26:48.307
if you're so mad at Mom?
I'm not looking for her,

26:48.407 --> 26:49.676
I'm looking for me.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.977
I just want to know
where he is

26:51.077 --> 26:52.745
and what the hell
he thinks he's doing.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.146
You never liked him.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.247
Yeah, well, neither did you.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.683
I liked him for Mom.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.518
They were happy, I guess.
I don't know.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.287
Marriage is complicated.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.490
Are you and Chuck okay?

27:04.590 --> 27:05.792
Yeah. Why?

27:05.892 --> 27:07.559
You seemed kind of upset
with him at dinner,

27:07.694 --> 27:09.195
when Mom was
ordering you around.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.430
Chuck is... Chuck.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.166
And it's just easier to
let Mom have her way.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.835
You should have
learned that by now.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.137
Yeah, but once you let her
choose the wine and napkins,

27:18.237 --> 27:19.706
then she's choosing
your career,

27:19.739 --> 27:20.773
your clothes, your house.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.474
I mean, where do you end up?

27:22.574 --> 27:24.811
You end up an ER doctor,

27:24.911 --> 27:27.914
married... to Chuck.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.885
Yeah, well, I'm not
doing this for her.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.321
I'm doing it for me.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.091
Thanks for the ride.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.469
"Beloved local magician
Morris the Magnificent

27:50.569 --> 27:52.604
presumed lost at sea."

27:52.739 --> 27:53.639
What?

27:53.740 --> 27:55.641
"Disappeared off cruise ship

27:55.742 --> 27:58.044
after terminal cancer
diagnosis."

27:58.144 --> 28:00.880
So he's declared dead
two months ago,

28:00.980 --> 28:03.750
and now he's renting
a house in Gresham?

28:03.850 --> 28:06.218
That is magic.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.964
Someone's coming to get this.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.112
Text Mom.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.614
Multnomah Parking Garage.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.450
That's... that's where

28:38.550 --> 28:41.120
Kim's boss got shot, right?

28:49.661 --> 28:51.463
Okay.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.918
Gets out of the elevator.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.692
He parked here...

29:20.827 --> 29:23.195
under the broken cameras.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.832
Doesn't see who's hiding
over there.

29:25.932 --> 29:30.069
Gets into his car...
blammo!

29:36.275 --> 29:38.544
The convention center.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.612
Huh.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.983
She gets so depressed

29:44.083 --> 29:45.484
I thought she might hurt herself
or do something.

29:45.584 --> 29:49.488
Mom, I know who witness
OA16 is, or might be.

29:49.588 --> 29:52.491
I went by the convention center
and spoke to Bob, and,

29:52.591 --> 29:55.261
night of the murder,
huge expo for this company

29:55.361 --> 29:57.129
that makes those little cameras
that go on your dashboard.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.866
Anyway, bunch of people in
town from foreign factories.

29:59.966 --> 30:03.002
So maybe some German guy
came into town,

30:03.102 --> 30:05.204
puts the device
in his rental car.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.606
But convention center parking
was full that night,

30:07.706 --> 30:10.142
so he had to park
in the overflow lot--

30:10.242 --> 30:11.543
the murder lot.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.081
And his little dash cam,
which uses MP9 files,

30:15.181 --> 30:16.448
like it said on that form,

30:16.548 --> 30:18.617
happened to catch
footage of the murderer.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.653
Huge job to contact
all those drivers,

30:21.753 --> 30:23.755
so maybe they didn't
hear back from Germany

30:23.856 --> 30:27.226
until after the trial starts,
and then, oop, gotta stall

30:27.326 --> 30:31.430
because suddenly here's footage
of Niki blazing away

30:31.530 --> 30:32.798
with Kim's gun.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.400
Todd,

30:34.500 --> 30:37.403
if the prosecution had video
of Niki murdering someone,

30:37.503 --> 30:40.172
they wouldn't be proceeding
with a case against Kim.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.642
You're right.
My theory was only half-cocked.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.178
Everything about you
is half-cocked.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.214
But... (sighs) Niki and the dad
are guilty of something.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.481
I-I know it.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.483
What is that?
What is that sound?

30:51.583 --> 30:53.285
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
It's the tNAB, my tNAB.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.653
It's a little
tracking device.

30:54.753 --> 30:56.355
I put it inside that box,
and it's-it's moving.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.825
Oh, it's going up Vista.
It's turning on Fairmont.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.260
Look, Mom,

31:01.360 --> 31:04.163
it's the perishable box
of the dead magician.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.465
And we're following

31:06.565 --> 31:09.335
this magician where?
To wherever he's going, okay?

31:09.435 --> 31:11.770
And could you speed up for once?
This is technically a car chase.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.172
<i>I will not break
the speed limit.</i>

31:13.272 --> 31:14.306
<i>You're going under</i>

31:14.406 --> 31:15.942
the speed limit.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.776
Wait, uh...
Oh, stop.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.545
There it is.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.181
Hmm.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.849
It's moving day. Yeah.

31:23.950 --> 31:27.186
I'll go in there, and I'll say
we're buyers for this house,

31:27.286 --> 31:28.720
and then you come up
with, like,

31:28.820 --> 31:30.122
a limp, and...
No, Todd.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.690
No more lies.
It feels fraudulent.

31:31.790 --> 31:34.660
We will tell them who we are
and what we need.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.062
The truth.

31:38.797 --> 31:41.700
Excuse me? Hello?

31:41.800 --> 31:44.836
Are you "Morris
the Magnificent"?

31:44.971 --> 31:46.705
Yes?
You're Morris,

31:46.805 --> 31:48.340
but you're dead.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.978
Oh, no, you must mean
my father, the original Morris.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.113
He-he passed.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.682
So, there's two magicians. Oh.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.017
How can I help you?

31:58.117 --> 32:00.586
I believe you know my
husband, Harry McDonald.

32:00.686 --> 32:01.988
Harry who?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.855
He's having his bills
sent to your...

32:03.990 --> 32:06.592
new home in Gresham.
Eddie? Did you order

32:06.692 --> 32:08.360
fresh carrots for the rabbit?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.762
They went to the shop.
Oh. Who's this?

32:10.862 --> 32:13.765
They're looking
for a Harry McDonald.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.636
I'm sorry, I can't divulge
client information.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.371
Client?

32:19.471 --> 32:21.307
Client for what?
Who are you?

32:21.407 --> 32:23.442
I'm sorry,
attorney-client privilege.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.444
What kind of attorney?
End of life.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.912
Estate planning.
I really shouldn't say

32:27.013 --> 32:28.147
anything more.
Wait, so he's getting all

32:28.247 --> 32:29.615
of his bills sent to you?

32:29.715 --> 32:31.517
A-A-And where is he?
Is he already dead?

32:31.617 --> 32:33.919
We are so sorry to bother you.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.822
Thank you very much.
Let's go, Todd.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.791
I was just getting somewhere
with that woman.

32:39.891 --> 32:41.293
Just get in the car, just stop
talking. Get in the car, please.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.828
And smile. Just smile
like we're happy

32:42.928 --> 32:44.463
we were here.
You look insane
right now, Mom.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.599
Why are you
acting crazy?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.537
It's Harry's laptop.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.672
I found it in a box
marked "Goodwill,"

32:53.772 --> 32:57.409
along with a-a pair of his shoes
and a shirt that I recognized.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.045
They're giving away
all of his things,

32:59.078 --> 33:00.479
So, you don't
want me lying,

33:00.579 --> 33:02.381
but it's okay for you to steal
from the Goodwill?

33:02.481 --> 33:03.815
Just open it.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.152
Find out where he is.
Track him. Do your thing.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.387
Do it.
Mom, it's a laptop,
not a crystal ball.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.688
Do it!
And he probably

33:09.788 --> 33:10.956
already...

33:11.057 --> 33:12.658
See, he already deleted
all his files.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.127
But I'll bet he forgot to wipe
all his stored passwords.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.829
Yeah, here we go,
still has all his passwords,

33:17.929 --> 33:20.466
but... maybe his
junk mail folder...

33:20.566 --> 33:22.401
A-ha.
"Walk-in bathtub,

33:22.501 --> 33:24.136
increase libido,
goodbye belly fat..."

33:24.236 --> 33:25.471
"Frequent flyer."

33:26.838 --> 33:30.376
He booked a flight with miles.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.411
What?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.680
Where is he going?
It doesn't say.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.248
It's just some junk receipt
from his credit card

33:36.348 --> 33:37.883
for redeemed miles. That's it.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.885
Well, wait, wait, what are
all those little numbers there

33:39.985 --> 33:41.453
down at the bottom
by the barcode?

33:41.553 --> 33:43.089
I don't know,
that might be...

33:43.122 --> 33:44.556
Wait, that's the date

33:44.656 --> 33:47.259
of his flight.
9/26/22.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.295
That's tomorrow, Monday,

33:49.395 --> 33:51.663
and 10:10 a.m.
is his departure time,

33:51.763 --> 33:54.100
so he'll be at the airport
tomorrow morning at 10:10 a.m.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.102
Mom, we got him.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.804
I have to be in
court tomorrow morning.

33:58.904 --> 34:01.840
The trial resumes at 9:00 a.m.

34:03.942 --> 34:07.213
I might have a way for you
to be in both places at once.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.024
Okay.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.594
Concourse B now,
still no sign of him,

34:22.694 --> 34:25.131
and we only got
nine minutes left. Sorry.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.599
All right, the prosecution

34:27.699 --> 34:29.701
has a motion
to introduce...

34:29.801 --> 34:31.537
Uh, what is this, Barrett?

34:31.637 --> 34:33.172
Oh, and by the way,
how are you feeling?

34:33.272 --> 34:35.341
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
Yes, I'm feeling

34:35.441 --> 34:36.742
much better.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.577
MAN (over P.A.):
Flight 256 to Iceland,

34:38.677 --> 34:41.147
Gate 47, final boarding.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.415
Flight 256 to Iceland,

34:43.515 --> 34:45.151
Gate 47, final boarding.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.590
"Bucket list." Uh...

34:52.791 --> 34:54.793
We have filed
to insert a crucial

34:54.893 --> 34:56.562
new witness into the lineup.

34:56.662 --> 34:59.298
Your Honor,
I have to object.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.999
This last-minute witness

35:01.167 --> 35:03.302
is a blatant attempt
to circumvent

35:03.402 --> 35:04.703
the state's known duty

35:04.803 --> 35:06.772
to disclose all witnesses
prior to trial.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.007
I'm sorry,
I'm going to allow it.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.909
I'm not gonna be able
to get through security.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.612
I... I don't even have a ticket.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.582
Hey. You.

35:16.682 --> 35:17.683
Betty Hogenson.

35:17.783 --> 35:18.717
Oh, my God.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.352
I'm wearing the neck brace.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.554
No, no, no, this isn't about
that. Um, I-I need a favor,

35:22.654 --> 35:23.989
and, uh...

35:24.089 --> 35:25.824
you owe me.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.193
And, Mrs. Lin, would you please

35:27.259 --> 35:29.328
tell the members of the jury
why you were here,

35:29.428 --> 35:31.897
in Portland, on the evening
of December 10 last year?

35:34.233 --> 35:37.236
I was here for a work
conference. Uh... Sorry,

35:37.336 --> 35:38.970
a convention.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.706
Excuse me, sir?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.208
Can I help you?

35:42.308 --> 35:44.075
Yeah, I'm, uh,
Betty with maintenance,

35:44.210 --> 35:46.044
and I left a thing in the back
of the plane. Can I just...?

35:46.212 --> 35:48.547
Yeah.
I'm just gonna...

35:48.647 --> 35:49.948
And, Mrs. Lin,

35:50.048 --> 35:53.485
this is your portable
travel dashboard camera,

35:53.585 --> 35:55.687
which you had with you
on your trip?

35:55.787 --> 35:58.224
You're gonna have
to put that away, sir.

36:02.761 --> 36:03.995
Got him.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.764
The video that
you're about to see

36:05.864 --> 36:08.734
is taken from Mrs. Lin's
dashboard camera.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.804
Now, first, we're going
to show you raw footage

36:12.904 --> 36:14.273
of her car
in the parking lot.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.842
Is the, uh, TV ready?

36:16.942 --> 36:18.977
Sorry, this may
take a moment.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.679
Please fasten your seatbelts

36:20.779 --> 36:22.448
and prepare for departure.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.115
Hey, what do you know?

36:24.250 --> 36:26.718
Iceland's on my
bucket list, too.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.021
You're not dying.

36:30.121 --> 36:31.923
I never meant
to hurt her, Todd.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.293
She doesn't have to know
about any of this.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.329
You stupid coward,

36:37.429 --> 36:38.830
what are you doing?

36:38.930 --> 36:40.266
I'm leaving your mother.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.833
Yeah, way ahead of you.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.635
I'm leaving
the whole world behind.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.937
My doctors, they told me that...

36:46.037 --> 36:47.873
I only have seven to ten years
left to live.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.308
Seven to ten years?

36:49.408 --> 36:51.176
I don't want
to live them with her.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.279
She's too controlling,
too critical.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.281
She never let me be
who I really want to be.

36:55.381 --> 36:58.917
I'm gonna go to Iceland and
live in a hut and farm and fish

36:59.017 --> 37:00.619
and be naked under the stars.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.555
It's my life, and this is how
I want to spend it.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.524
You are a freak and an idiot.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.527
Did you actually want my mom
to think you were dead?

37:08.627 --> 37:10.762
And now, in an enhanced
section of the same footage,

37:10.862 --> 37:13.632
there she is.
Kim Marquette

37:13.732 --> 37:14.800
with a gun...

37:14.900 --> 37:16.835
...in her hand.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.070
I know this will be
hard on her, but...

37:19.170 --> 37:21.840
she has you, her kids.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.142
And, Todd, let's be honest,

37:24.310 --> 37:26.612
it's time for you to stop
this ridiculous fight with her.

37:26.712 --> 37:29.581
Are you joking? You're telling
me how to deal with my mom?

37:29.681 --> 37:32.918
After you literally...
Your mother loves you.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.185
Why do you think
she spent two years

37:34.320 --> 37:35.454
fighting the city
trying to reinstate

37:35.554 --> 37:36.655
your license?

37:36.755 --> 37:37.823
Wait, she what?

37:37.923 --> 37:39.325
Because she's
your mother,

37:39.358 --> 37:41.827
and she'd do anything for you.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.629
Anything.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.030
Ladies and gentleman

37:45.130 --> 37:46.532
of the jury,
as you can see,

37:46.632 --> 37:49.601
Ms. Marquette was clearly
at the scene of the crime

37:49.701 --> 37:52.003
the night
of the murder.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.574
Sir, you need to come
with us. Let's go.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.843
You better die in Iceland
in seven to ten years,

37:57.943 --> 37:59.978
and don't you ever, ever
come back here.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.347
Let's go.
I'm sorry, Mom.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.715
I'm so sorry.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.385
Margaret,
your witness.

38:07.353 --> 38:10.422
Don't say a word,
no matter what I do.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.358
Trust me.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.361
Your Honor,

38:15.427 --> 38:18.364
in light of this
overwhelming new evidence,

38:18.464 --> 38:22.401
my client would like
to change her plea to guilty.

38:23.535 --> 38:24.870
What?
And while we recognize

38:24.970 --> 38:26.538
that in the state of Oregon,

38:26.638 --> 38:29.375
first-degree murder carries
a mandatory life sentence...

38:29.475 --> 38:30.942
What are you doing?
...I would ask

38:31.042 --> 38:34.012
that you consider the nature
of my client's assault,

38:34.112 --> 38:36.548
and perhaps reduce
the prison sentence

38:36.648 --> 38:38.817
to 50 or 60 years.

38:38.917 --> 38:39.985
No.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.822
No. She didn't do it.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.257
That's not her, Mar.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.194
I only meant to scare him.

38:49.294 --> 38:52.498
And then he tried
to take the gun,

38:52.598 --> 38:53.565
and it just--

38:53.665 --> 38:57.135
I never thought
they'd blame her.

39:01.407 --> 39:05.944
I just hoped that
it would save her.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.814
You didn't mean to kill him.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.318
I can make a jury
understand that.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.320
And the charges against
Kim Marquette were dropped

39:15.421 --> 39:17.322
as her mother was
taken into custody...

39:17.423 --> 39:19.591
...following an emotional
outburst in the courtroom.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.326
And now, for traffic
and weather.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.562
Tomorrow looking much
like today,

39:23.662 --> 39:25.531
and as we head into the next...

39:30.902 --> 39:31.903
You're in jail.

39:32.003 --> 39:35.941
Worse. Airport jail.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.443
How'd you get in here?

39:37.509 --> 39:39.611
You have a good lawyer.

39:39.711 --> 39:44.182
So, Niki and the dad,
what was their secret?

39:44.282 --> 39:47.085
Uh, Kim didn't lose her gun
two years ago.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.320
They took it.
They hid it from her.

39:49.455 --> 39:52.223
They were worried
she would harm herself.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.626
She was struggling
with depression.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.261
But what they didn't
know was that...

39:56.361 --> 39:59.465
That the mom knew where
the gun was hidden. Aha.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.468
And what about witness OA16?
German?

40:02.568 --> 40:05.504
Italian? Romanian?

40:05.604 --> 40:07.439
Chinese.

40:08.239 --> 40:12.511
You are very good
at this job.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.615
Yeah, I-I know.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.383
Maybe I should
just let you be

40:18.484 --> 40:20.519
who you want to be.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.722
Yeah.

40:25.323 --> 40:27.358
But there is one thing
I could do for you

40:27.459 --> 40:29.194
to help you get back
on your feet.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.863
Uh, help us both, actually.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.799
If you'll let me.

40:38.637 --> 40:41.640
It is 1:00 p.m.,
and it's gonna be fine.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.510
You're a detective again,
an investigator.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.144
This is what you want.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.113
This is the way back.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.447
Okay? Right.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.083
Right? Okay.
Todd?

40:52.183 --> 40:54.085
Susan.
Congratulations.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.054
I heard you were
coming aboard.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.288
Thanks.
Thank you. Yeah.

40:57.388 --> 40:58.557
Well, it's not
a permanent thing.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.825
I'm just covering
for the investigator

40:59.925 --> 41:00.992
on maternity leave.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.260
Right. Nadia.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.695
She had twins.
Yeah, yeah.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.264
And I'll be around now,
so, you know,

41:06.364 --> 41:08.233
if maybe a lunch happens...

41:08.333 --> 41:10.435
I mean, we'll be
working together,

41:10.536 --> 41:12.738
and you'll need me.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.039
Professionally.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.441
Okay, yeah.
That sounds great.

41:16.542 --> 41:19.545
You know, actually, I have
to get to a Zoom, but...

41:19.578 --> 41:21.613
I'll see you around.

41:21.713 --> 41:24.149
Yeah.

You look like an accountant.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.649
Thank you. Thank you.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.952
Wait, are you guys going
out to lunch without me?

42:01.052 --> 42:03.321
You have far too many
cases to catch up on.

42:03.421 --> 42:05.156
Now, the ties, the socks,

42:05.256 --> 42:06.592
shirt and belt in that bag

42:06.692 --> 42:08.594
are more professional
than what you're wearing.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.596
We can take it out

42:10.696 --> 42:12.297
And this is your bus pass,

42:12.397 --> 42:15.601

that jalopy into this building.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.468
