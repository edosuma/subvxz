WEBVTT

00:04.375 --> 00:07.083
Hey, you know what I was thinking, honey?

00:07.458 --> 00:10.917
We should have a little romantic getaway
this weekend, just you and me.

00:11.166 --> 00:13.041
Guys, please, we're trying to eat here.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.959
I think that sounds fun.
Where should we go?

00:17.041 --> 00:18.333
Casper, Wyoming...

00:19.709 --> 00:21.458
the most romantic city...

00:22.625 --> 00:23.792
in Wyoming.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.458
Is the bug convention in Casper this year?

00:28.875 --> 00:29.959
The bug convention?

00:32.542 --> 00:35.375
Well, I'll just check the old calendar.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.166
Ha! Now that is a coincidence.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.667
Hey, Mom, I think you should go.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.375
Why? You planning to throw a party
while we're gone?

00:45.458 --> 00:48.208
Now that is a coincidence.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.208
Amy: Oh.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.542
Well, party's off. I'm not going.

00:51.625 --> 00:52.917
Why not, Mom?

00:53.542 --> 00:55.625
Bug convention sounds like a lot of--

00:56.625 --> 00:57.750
I can't even get through it.

00:59.458 --> 01:01.208
What do you even do at a bug convention?

01:01.333 --> 01:03.625
Nothing.
It's just a bunch of exterminators

01:03.709 --> 01:06.458
in a cramped conference room
talking about deadly gas.

01:08.166 --> 01:09.917
And then it gets boring.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.250
First of all, honey, we are not a bunch.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.000
We are a swarm.

01:16.083 --> 01:17.041
Bob: Huh?

01:17.375 --> 01:20.000
We got a lot of fun
bug-related lingo like that,

01:20.083 --> 01:23.417
like, uh, uh...
we don't get rooms, we nest.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.500
We don't dine, we feed.

01:28.375 --> 01:31.333
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but can someone drive me to school?

01:33.250 --> 01:34.583
All right, guys, you know what?

01:34.667 --> 01:36.875
Pest control is what I do for a living.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.667
Now I know it just may be rats
and roaches and maggots to you,

01:39.750 --> 01:41.041
but it's my bread and butter.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.709

- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.625
Remember when
I went off to college to KCU?

02:47.917 --> 02:49.750
- Kwikki Chikki University.
- Yeah.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.291
The weekend training seminar.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.542
I remember it well.

02:53.875 --> 02:56.667
Uh, well,
back in those crazy college days...

02:56.750 --> 02:59.333
Those two crazy college days.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.667
I met this guy named Gravy
and I told him if he was ever in town,

03:03.750 --> 03:04.667
he could stay with us.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.500
And I just found out
he's moving to Denver,

03:07.625 --> 03:09.166
and he's gonna be working
at Kwikki Chikki.

03:09.583 --> 03:12.709
Okay, I think I see where this is going.
When is this happening?

03:12.959 --> 03:15.500
Man: Party!

03:17.542 --> 03:18.583
Right about now.

03:19.083 --> 03:22.083
PJ, I can't believe you're springing
a houseguest on me at a time like this.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.667
- Gravy!
- PJ!

03:28.709 --> 03:30.125
That was the Kwikki Chikki handshake.

03:30.583 --> 03:31.500
I was hoping.

03:33.625 --> 03:37.250
Dude, you didn't tell me
your sister was so hot.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.208
Gravy, stay as long as you like.

03:43.458 --> 03:46.083
Oh! Sweet crib!

03:46.166 --> 03:47.667
Yeah, dude. Oh!

03:47.750 --> 03:49.542
I'm so psyched you're here, dude.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.458
- This is gonna be a blast.
- Oh, epic!

03:52.917 --> 03:54.583
Just think of all those wild times
at college.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.500
Yeah.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.750
Dude, remember the time
the girls from hamburger tech

03:57.834 --> 04:00.333
- came and partied with us?
- Yeah, yeah!

04:00.834 --> 04:02.417
Oh! Or what about the time...

04:03.959 --> 04:05.291
I think that's the only story we have.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.750
Hey, Mom, listen to this.

04:12.834 --> 04:15.125
It's from that advice column "Dear Tammy."

04:15.291 --> 04:17.125
It says, uh, "Dear Tammy,

04:17.250 --> 04:22.125
recently, a car I owned for 20 minutes
was sadly wrecked.

04:22.208 --> 04:24.375
How do I ask my parents for another one?"

04:24.792 --> 04:26.875
Wow. That's almost exactly
what happened to you.

04:26.959 --> 04:28.208
I know.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.917
So, so then "Dear Tammy" replied,

04:32.125 --> 04:35.166
"If your parents love you,
they will buy you a new car

04:35.250 --> 04:36.667
and be glad they did."

04:41.041 --> 04:43.000
- That is so strange.
- Teddy: Yeah.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.667
Because "Dear Tammy" passed away
three years ago.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.333
Well, that's a pretty good
answer for a dead lady, right?

04:51.417 --> 04:52.667
Hmm.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.750
Mom, please, owning that car
was the best 20 minutes of my life.

04:56.834 --> 04:57.917
Honey.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.583
If it were up to me,
I'd buy you a new car.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.667
The problem is your father.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.583
He's been on a tear lately
about saving money.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.417
What is wrong with him?

05:05.917 --> 05:07.834
He's always saving
and planning for the future.

05:07.917 --> 05:10.250
What did grandma and grandpa do to him?

05:13.917 --> 05:15.250
How badly do you want this car?

05:15.333 --> 05:16.375
Really badly.

05:17.834 --> 05:18.834
Sit down.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.333
Teddy...

05:28.041 --> 05:30.917
your father is a simple man.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.834
- Yes, yes, I'm with you so far.
- Amy: Okay.

05:35.959 --> 05:37.834
If you want something from him,

05:38.375 --> 05:41.208
then you need to do
something he wants to do.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.959
Then when he's in his happy place,
just strike like a cobra.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.208
Okay, what are you talking about?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.250
The bug convention, Teddy.

05:50.792 --> 05:52.917
The bug convention.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.959
You go there with your father
and he will be so happy...

05:58.041 --> 05:59.750
He will buy you a car.

05:59.834 --> 06:03.125
Perfect. I'll go to the bug convention.
How bad could it be?

06:03.250 --> 06:04.583
You have no idea.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.125
I went to one convention.

06:08.125 --> 06:09.959
I still have the dreams.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.458
Hey, Gabe, guess what I got.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.917
Last time we played this game,
it was lice.

06:22.875 --> 06:27.041
My mom gave me this cool new video camera
for getting cut from the baseball team.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.542
How does getting cut from the team
get you a camera?

06:29.667 --> 06:30.917
She felt bad for me,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.500
and my dad gave me
a skateboard for trying out.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.208
I love sports.

06:37.166 --> 06:38.458
This is pretty cool.

06:38.834 --> 06:41.125
- We should make a movie.
- Yeah.

06:42.125 --> 06:42.959
Ew!

06:43.667 --> 06:45.792
The camera does not love you.

06:47.333 --> 06:50.542
But it does love me.
So I should be the star.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.583
Dude, you're getting more
like your mom every day.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.875
So, uh, what kind of movie should we make?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.333
How about a romantic comedy?

06:58.375 --> 07:00.500
Everyone loves a good rom-com.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.041
Hey, I thought of something
while you were talking.

07:05.166 --> 07:07.250
Let's make a monster movie.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.667
Cool, but where are we
gonna find a scary monster?

07:10.750 --> 07:11.875
Boo!

07:13.542 --> 07:15.041
I think we found our monster.

07:25.875 --> 07:26.834
Done.

07:27.625 --> 07:28.667
Done.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.083
And...

07:30.834 --> 07:31.834
not done.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.542
How are you doing, A. Dunc?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.041
A. Dunc?

07:36.458 --> 07:38.166
Oh, yeah. That's my new name for you.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.625
Amy just wasn't kind of working for me.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.125
Aren't you loving him?

07:47.750 --> 07:49.959
Loving? No, no.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.166
Liking? No.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.166
Getting on my very last nerve?

07:55.250 --> 07:56.750
Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.542
Gravy honey,
did you forget something in the kitchen?

08:08.709 --> 08:09.625
No, I'm good.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.500
I meant your pants.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.792
Oh, yeah, I know. I just like
to take those off when I get home.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.917
It's kind of how I unwind.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.875
Okay, look, I get it
that you're trying to be comfortable.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.000
That is not how we roll
in the Duncan house.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.250
Dude, you're right.
This is so much more comfortable.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.500
Honey, you're not gonna believe this.

08:30.583 --> 08:33.458
Teddy wants to go
to the bug convention with me.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.250
Are we going pantsless now?

08:37.375 --> 08:39.917
This is the best day ever!

08:45.875 --> 08:47.291
"Attack of the 50-foot Baby, "

08:47.375 --> 08:48.917
scene 1, take 1.

08:50.375 --> 08:53.834
Okay, you're a mad scientist. On action!

08:55.000 --> 08:56.792
Now that I've finished
my super growth formula,

08:56.875 --> 08:59.375
it's time to test it out
on an ordinary grape.

09:03.458 --> 09:04.291
Cut.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.208
Action.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.125
It works on fruit,

09:15.208 --> 09:16.792
but what about on human beings?

09:17.417 --> 09:18.834
I'll test it out myself.

09:19.667 --> 09:22.125
But first, let me check on my baby.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.750
Baby. Oh, baby!

09:28.083 --> 09:30.250
Charlie, come here. Come here.

09:30.458 --> 09:32.208
- Can you go drink the stuff now?
- No.

09:32.792 --> 09:33.959
It's just juice.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.000
And cut.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.500
Dude, what's your sister's problem?

09:41.583 --> 09:43.000
She's gotta drink the stuff.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.375
She's two.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.000
When I was two, I drank everything.

09:48.667 --> 09:49.792
Just let me talk to her.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.959
Charlie, sweetheart.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.000
You're doing great.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.750
The picture's gonna look terrific.

09:58.458 --> 09:59.583
Here's the thing.

09:59.750 --> 10:03.875
When we say drink the stuff,
you gotta drink the stuff, okay?

10:03.959 --> 10:06.709
Okay, great. Here we go.

10:06.792 --> 10:07.834
Are you ready to...

10:08.667 --> 10:10.792
Jake, what are you doing?
We need that for the movie.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.083
I'm doing an experiment.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.333
I wanna see if it turns my pee blue.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.333
PJ!

10:22.959 --> 10:23.917
Hey, Mom, what's up?

10:24.000 --> 10:24.959
What's up?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.792
Look at what Gravy has done to this place.

10:28.542 --> 10:29.750
Hey, he tidied up.

10:32.041 --> 10:32.959
I've had it.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.583
He's disgusting. He's a slob.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.709
I can't take it anymore. I want him out.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.709
Is this about the onion ring
in the toilet?

10:39.792 --> 10:41.417
'Cause he needs a target.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.333
Either you tell him
by the end of the day tomorrow,

10:46.417 --> 10:47.583
or I do it.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.917
Oh, but he's my best friend from college.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.458
Chicken college,
a two-day chicken college!

10:54.166 --> 10:56.083
All right, okay.

10:56.166 --> 11:00.458
But this has to be done the right way
'cause Gravy's actually really sensitive.

11:01.083 --> 11:02.000
All right, bad news, guys.

11:02.083 --> 11:05.166
I just drank, like, a gallon of water
and we are out of onion rings.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.834
Casper, Wyoming,

11:15.917 --> 11:19.542
bug convention, guys in overalls.

11:19.667 --> 11:20.542
Eh...

11:21.917 --> 11:23.166
You talk now.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.208
Oh, hey, hors d'oeuvres.
Help yourself, honey.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.166
Okay.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.709
Bob: Mmm.

11:29.792 --> 11:30.625
Mmm.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.041
This is good. It's crunchy.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.542
Freeze-dried ants.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.583
All the food here is insect-based.
Isn't that fun?

11:42.333 --> 11:44.583
- Bob.
- Murray.

11:44.959 --> 11:47.208
Hey, I would like to introduce you
to my daughter Teddy.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.542
Um, hi.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.667
Hey, Dad, do I have any legs in my teeth?

11:52.834 --> 11:53.667
She's a charmer.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.208
So, Bob, you gonna pop by my speech?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.041
Keynote address, whatever.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.333
Yeah, I got a new way to kill termites...

12:04.125 --> 12:05.250
the Murray method.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.417
Well, actually, Murray,
I'm going on right after you.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.959
Yeah, I got my own new
method of killing termites...

12:11.041 --> 12:13.041
the Slam Dunc.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.083
I don't get it.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.291
Bob Duncan.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.083
Dunc. Slam Dunc.

12:20.291 --> 12:23.750
- Ooh, I see because... no.
- Ah.

12:25.792 --> 12:29.291
Well, I'm sure it will be very clear
after the presentation.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.959
I've seen your presentations, Duncan.

12:32.291 --> 12:35.959
They lack pizzazz. No visual aids.
That's your problem.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.333
Pass.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.667
Man, I hate that Murray.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.250
But do you know what?
Here's what he doesn't know.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.583
This year, I have a visual aid

12:45.667 --> 12:48.709
that is going to blow the roof
off this place,

12:48.792 --> 12:50.250
thanks to you, honey.

12:50.333 --> 12:53.291
Or, uh, should I say

12:53.583 --> 12:55.458
termite queen?

12:55.875 --> 12:57.750
- What?
- Yeah!

12:58.750 --> 13:00.709
You're gonna be onstage with me this year

13:00.834 --> 13:04.667
playing the disgustingly huge
supreme monarch of the termite colony.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.959
But... but... uh...

13:15.500 --> 13:16.375
Okay.

13:26.583 --> 13:27.834
Hey, Gravy. Uh...

13:29.125 --> 13:31.166
Can I talk to you for a sec?
It's kind of important.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.250
Of course. You can tell me anything.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.500
I mean, you were my best buddy
at Kwikki Chikki.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.125
I would do anything for you.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.834
I would even eat our chicken for you.

13:42.625 --> 13:44.583
I would never ask you to do that.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.834
Yeah. Um...

13:47.166 --> 13:50.458
But the thing is, uh...
it's been super great having you here.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.000
Yeah. Yeah.

13:52.208 --> 13:54.458
Uh, but... Yeah.

13:55.959 --> 13:56.959
Wow, this is hard.

13:57.041 --> 13:58.083
Uh, well...

13:58.417 --> 14:00.458
Actually, there was something
I wanted to tell you.

14:01.083 --> 14:05.083
Um, A. Dunc keeps rearranging my room.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.917
Not cool, all right?

14:08.542 --> 14:09.542
Talk to her for me?

14:11.125 --> 14:12.667
Dude, I've been home for like an hour.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.667
What am I still doing with my pants on?

14:22.875 --> 14:24.083
The Murray method,

14:24.166 --> 14:26.709
a safe non-toxic elixir
for killing termites,

14:26.792 --> 14:29.583
derived from the common orange.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.375
Try the Murray method and you'll say,

14:31.458 --> 14:33.959
"Orange you glad you're not a termite?"

14:40.917 --> 14:42.083
Try and top that, Duncan.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.875
Oh, go squeeze yourself.

14:46.834 --> 14:47.917
Hey, everybody,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.667
I am Bob Duncan of Bob's Bugs Be Gone.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.709
Now sure, yes.

14:53.083 --> 14:58.125
You can pay Murray to go and spray
orange juice all over your house or...

14:59.875 --> 15:03.250
you can attack the problem at its source.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.709
And what is that source?

15:06.041 --> 15:07.166
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:08.250 --> 15:09.291
I give you

15:10.500 --> 15:12.625
the termite queen!

15:17.750 --> 15:20.291
Oh, gonna get a car. Gonna get a car.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.375
The termite queen,

15:24.834 --> 15:27.542
the grand royal mama of the colony.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.041
Her only job,

15:29.125 --> 15:31.792
pumping out termite eggs around the clock.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.000
Behold!

15:37.041 --> 15:38.166
Termite eggs,

15:38.250 --> 15:41.667
30,000 every single day.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.625
Go, my babies, go.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.542
Eat wood and destroy siding.

15:49.041 --> 15:51.667
Relax, everybody, relax. Keep your seats.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.166
There is a solution.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.083
Here, your majesty,

15:55.583 --> 15:58.083
try the Slam Dunc.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.792
Ha!

16:01.166 --> 16:04.125
Oh! Curse you, Slam Dunc method.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.959
I'm rendered useless.
Do you hear me? Useless.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.875
Oh! Oh, what a world.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.000
What a world.

16:16.041 --> 16:16.959
Car.

16:22.083 --> 16:25.792
Okay, you're a 50-foot baby
about to destroy the entire city.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.417
On action.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.333
Cut!

16:32.542 --> 16:33.667
What do you want me to do?

16:33.750 --> 16:37.166
Dude, we're never gonna finish this movie
if she keeps running off.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.542
How do we solve that?
Glue her shoes to the floor?

16:46.959 --> 16:50.041
Okay, these puppies aren't going anywhere.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.208
Amy: Charlie.

16:51.709 --> 16:52.667
Dude, your mom.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.208
There you are.

16:55.959 --> 16:56.875
What are you boys doing?

16:56.959 --> 16:59.709
Not gluing shoes to the floor.
That's for sure.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.458
Gabriel Duncan!

17:06.625 --> 17:08.667
She... she wouldn't do what we wanted.

17:08.750 --> 17:09.667
Oh, I should have known.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.041
Every time you ask to watch Charlie,

17:11.125 --> 17:12.750
it's because you wanna glue her
to something.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.291
Mom.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.667
Sorry, boys, the kid's out of the picture.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.125
Mom, we're not done yet.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.333
Now, what are we gonna do?

17:22.500 --> 17:25.625
We got a monster movie with no monster.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.000
Unless...

17:30.709 --> 17:33.458
Now rain down some terror.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.500
Welcome to Kwikki Chikki.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.083
Would you like to try
our new batter balls?

17:44.166 --> 17:45.667
- No.
- Good call.

17:46.583 --> 17:49.542
I will have the Kwikki combo number three

17:49.625 --> 17:52.000
with coleslaw, curly fries,

17:52.083 --> 17:54.041
and you have to move out by tomorrow.

17:55.709 --> 17:56.917
PJ, is that you?

17:57.917 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, it's me.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.542
I couldn't do this face to face,

18:05.625 --> 18:07.375
so I thought I'd do it face to...

18:08.000 --> 18:08.959
beak.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.750
Look, Gravy, I love you like a brother,

18:13.834 --> 18:17.750
but you're kinda messy
and you're driving my mom nuts,

18:17.834 --> 18:19.542
and you gotta go.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.166
Oh, and I'll have a chocolate milkshake.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.500
Talk to me, man, come on. You there?

18:30.583 --> 18:32.250
Oh, hey, do you mind?

18:32.583 --> 18:33.792
I'm having a moment here.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.333
Gravy, come on. Dude, talk to me.

18:38.041 --> 18:40.125
PJ, I'll find another place to stay.

18:40.417 --> 18:41.542
It's no biggie.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.250
Oh, and that'll be $4.95
at the second window.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.000
I'm sorry, man.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.291
Ah! Don't worry about it.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.375
I mean, you're my buddy.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.083
The fact that it was so hard for you
to say this to me,

18:54.166 --> 18:55.917
I mean, it means a lot.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.000
So we good?

18:59.458 --> 19:00.458
You wanna flap it out?

19:01.542 --> 19:02.542
Yeah.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.125
Oh, uh, Dad, before we go in,

19:15.208 --> 19:16.875
there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

19:16.959 --> 19:19.750
- What's that, honey?
- First, are you happy?

19:20.125 --> 19:21.583
Are you kidding me?

19:22.500 --> 19:23.542
I'm over the moon.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.625
That was the best bug convention ever.

19:25.709 --> 19:26.875
Oh! Great, great.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.792
'Cause there's something
that I wanted to ask you.

19:28.875 --> 19:29.834
Actually, you know what?

19:29.917 --> 19:31.625
Before you do,
there's something I wanna say.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.166
You know, sometimes I just feel

19:35.250 --> 19:37.375
like you kids
are growing up so fast that...

19:39.417 --> 19:41.959
...oh, that you just don't have time
for your old man.

19:42.041 --> 19:43.041
You know?

19:43.125 --> 19:45.208
So when you asked
to come with me this weekend,

19:46.125 --> 19:47.125
honey,

19:47.583 --> 19:50.542
you made me feel so great.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.625
Thank you.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.750
And I love you very, very much.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.417
I'm sorry. What did you wanna ask me?

20:06.083 --> 20:09.125
Oh, uh, I just wanted to say...

20:10.917 --> 20:12.959
I... I love you too, Dad.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.166
Love you too.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.875
- Hey.
- Hey, there's my little bugaboos.

20:20.959 --> 20:23.083
- How was the convention?
- The best ever.

20:23.166 --> 20:24.250
Well...

20:24.333 --> 20:26.166
Bob: Hey, Teddy, tell her all about it.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.250
Okeydokey.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.250
He looks pretty happy.
What kind of car you getting?

20:31.083 --> 20:33.291
Oh, I couldn't do it.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.458
Amy: What?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.875
You got him all happied up for nothing?

20:39.875 --> 20:41.875
Looks like mama's getting
a new pair of shoes.

20:43.417 --> 20:44.834
Amy: Oh, Bob honey.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.542
Hey, Charlie.

20:53.625 --> 20:56.834
Well, I did the right thing,
went with Dad to the bug convention,

20:56.917 --> 20:58.041
made him real happy.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.500
Unfortunately, so happy

21:00.583 --> 21:02.750
he invited me to go again next year.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.041
I'm gonna be a mosquito.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.667
- What are you doing?
- Just measuring your wingspan.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.709
Oh.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.959
We're gonna be selling the Duncan zapper.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.750
Oh, zapper!

21:22.125 --> 21:23.166
Sounds painful.

21:24.875 --> 21:27.417
Now someday you're gonna be going
to these bug conventions.

21:27.709 --> 21:29.834
Yeah. Good luck, Charlie.

21:35.291 --> 21:36.834
Okay.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.667
"Attack of the 50-foot Baby,"
scene 1, take 1.

21:45.625 --> 21:48.917
"Attack of the 50-foot Baby,"
scene 1, take 1.

21:49.834 --> 21:53.375
Jake: Okay, you're a mad scientist.
On action.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.083
Now that I've finished
my super growth formula,

22:00.166 --> 22:02.792
it's time to test it out
on an ordinary grape.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.583
It works!

22:08.166 --> 22:10.458
Jake: No, it doesn't. It's a rubber ducky.

22:11.208 --> 22:12.959
Well, if somebody hadn't
eaten the watermelon,

22:13.041 --> 22:14.583
I wouldn't have to improvise.
