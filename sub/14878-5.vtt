WEBVTT

00:05.450 --> 00:07.151
Oh, annie, you shouldn't have.

00:07.219 --> 00:09.787
I graduated from lunch
duty to coffee runs.

00:09.855 --> 00:11.322
It's cold.

00:11.390 --> 00:13.157
Well, I had to deliver ten cups.

00:13.225 --> 00:14.492
Couldn't you deliver mine first?

00:14.560 --> 00:15.860
I thought we were friends.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.194
Which is why I can
give you cold coffee

00:17.262 --> 00:18.696
And not worry about getting fired.

00:18.764 --> 00:20.464
I have a present for you.

00:20.532 --> 00:21.899
Just came in.

00:21.967 --> 00:23.768
Video, text, camera, data storage,

00:23.835 --> 00:25.169
All freshly cia encrypted.

00:25.237 --> 00:26.337
- Ooh.
- Uh-uh.

00:26.405 --> 00:27.538
Trade you for your old one.

00:27.606 --> 00:33.477
No complaints from me.

00:33.545 --> 00:34.545
Whoa!

00:34.613 --> 00:38.749
Careful.

00:38.817 --> 00:40.151
What is it?

00:40.218 --> 00:41.586
I got a fast track here.

00:41.653 --> 00:43.921
Armed shipment bound for the u.S.

00:43.989 --> 00:45.456
Three surface-to-air missiles.

00:45.524 --> 00:46.991
Our johannesburg station
believes they went

00:47.059 --> 00:48.192
Out of richards bay last week

00:48.260 --> 00:50.361
Hidden onboard a container ship,

00:50.429 --> 00:52.597
So they're gonna be here
in the next 24 to 48 hours.

00:52.664 --> 00:53.631
What ship?

00:53.699 --> 00:54.799
We don't have it.

00:54.866 --> 00:56.267
Destination city?

00:56.335 --> 00:57.835
We don't have that.

00:57.903 --> 00:59.136
What do we have?

00:59.204 --> 01:02.073
The shipper was hasaan waleed.

01:07.179 --> 01:09.547
The bribes I had
to make were, um,

01:09.615 --> 01:11.449
More expensive than I
originally estimated.

01:11.516 --> 01:14.652
We agreed on $100,000.
Not $150,000.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.855
I need $50,000 more.

01:22.861 --> 01:24.228
How about you?

01:24.296 --> 01:27.665
Is $100,000 enough?

01:27.733 --> 01:29.400
Good.

01:29.468 --> 01:32.737
I expect to be in the
United States tomorrow.

01:32.804 --> 01:34.672
We have sams coming into the u.S.

01:34.706 --> 01:35.806
We don't know the city.

01:35.874 --> 01:37.575
The shipper is hasaan waleed,

01:37.643 --> 01:39.543
But we don't know where he is.

01:39.611 --> 01:41.112
- Any more from jo'burg?
- No.

01:41.179 --> 01:43.481
Security cameras at richards
bay were conveniently

01:43.548 --> 01:45.082
Shut down for four hours.

01:45.150 --> 01:47.184
Every boat in the port's
log is accounted for,

01:47.252 --> 01:48.486
So clearly this is off the book.

01:48.553 --> 01:49.920
And humint?

01:49.988 --> 01:52.423
Southern africa station's
pretty thin these days.

01:52.491 --> 01:54.959
This is a world-renowned
arms dealer we're talking about

01:55.027 --> 01:56.727
And we can't get any bodies on him?

01:56.795 --> 01:59.196
We could end-around with
the aivd in amsterdam.

01:59.264 --> 02:00.731
We might have an in.

02:00.799 --> 02:02.266
All right.

02:02.334 --> 02:06.537
I could use some support.

02:06.605 --> 02:09.340
Kelting, you're with jai.

02:09.407 --> 02:11.242
Anyone stateside?

02:11.309 --> 02:13.477
Rumors of some contacts with
the sudanese expat community

02:13.545 --> 02:15.613
In new york, but that
was five years ago.

02:15.681 --> 02:16.914
And who's early in camp?

02:16.982 --> 02:18.182
Kimmer, but he's new.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.650
Angle just transferred
back from khartoum.

02:19.718 --> 02:20.885
Who else have we got?

02:20.952 --> 02:23.054
Mcauley.

02:27.392 --> 02:28.592
Who else?

02:28.660 --> 02:33.030
Nobody else ever
had his connections.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.435
All right, annie...

02:37.502 --> 02:40.371
Track down mcauley,
see if he'll play ball.

02:40.439 --> 02:41.706
You're new.

02:41.773 --> 02:45.009
Maybe you'll have a shot.

02:50.148 --> 02:52.683
Why did jones say I might
have a shot because I'm new?

02:52.751 --> 02:54.985
Mcauley is christopher mcauley.

02:55.053 --> 02:56.921
He was a deep-cover
officer for 15 years.

02:56.988 --> 02:58.622
Knew everyone important
that had anything to do

02:58.690 --> 02:59.890
With east africa.

02:59.958 --> 03:01.459
One of his old contacts
might know something

03:01.526 --> 03:02.860
About hasaan's movements,

03:02.928 --> 03:04.995
But mcauley retired five years ago.

03:05.063 --> 03:06.964
Why do I feel like I'm
still missing something?

03:07.032 --> 03:08.432
Well, when I say he retired,
I mean he had

03:08.500 --> 03:10.000
A nervous breakdown, quit the cia,

03:10.068 --> 03:11.302
Moved to middle-of-nowhere,
virginia,

03:11.369 --> 03:12.937
And hasn't contaed us sivce.

03:13.004 --> 03:15.106
I can actually hear you frowning.

03:15.173 --> 03:17.141
On a scale of none to a lot,

03:17.209 --> 03:18.609
How many people have
tried to bring him in?

03:18.677 --> 03:20.778
Almost every senior
person in that room.

03:20.846 --> 03:22.146
So this is basically
a fool's errand?

03:22.214 --> 03:23.781
You could think of it
more of a hazing ritual

03:23.849 --> 03:26.817
If it makes you feel better.

03:26.885 --> 03:29.587
Sorry. Busy day.

03:29.654 --> 03:33.624
Thanks, fellas.

03:33.692 --> 03:35.259
Keeping the old man waiting, huh?

03:35.327 --> 03:37.361
Bit of a power play?

03:37.429 --> 03:39.797
You're still in
your raincoat, dad.

03:39.865 --> 03:41.465
You just walked through
the door yourself.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.701
You caught me.

03:43.769 --> 03:45.669
You know you actually
have to put that on?

03:45.737 --> 03:46.937
Protocol.

03:47.005 --> 03:48.572
There should be special badges

03:48.640 --> 03:51.509
For people who ran the
place for ten years.

03:51.576 --> 03:53.477
Dad, they are dedicating
the new ops center

03:53.545 --> 03:54.779
To you in two days.

03:54.846 --> 03:56.413
You expect new badges too?

03:56.481 --> 03:59.750
What makes you think
I expect anything, son?

03:59.818 --> 04:02.019
I'm just happy to be here.

04:06.725 --> 04:08.959
Henry wilcox, love the new beard.

04:09.027 --> 04:11.128
Arthur, good to see you.

04:11.196 --> 04:13.297
Been a long time since
you invited me over.

04:13.365 --> 04:14.698
Well, not since
your retirement party,

04:14.766 --> 04:16.166
I would think.

04:16.233 --> 04:20.838
Henry wilcox is here and
he's talking to arthur.

04:20.906 --> 04:21.939
Where?

04:22.007 --> 04:27.044
Your 8:00.

04:27.112 --> 04:28.579
What the heck was that?

04:28.647 --> 04:30.414
If anyone's going to be sucked in

04:30.482 --> 04:32.550
By his evil vortex,
I'd prefer it be you.

04:32.617 --> 04:34.351
Oh, thanks.

04:34.419 --> 04:35.753
I'm nothing, if t cautious.

04:35.821 --> 04:37.621
Got to love they're gonna dedicate

04:37.689 --> 04:39.256
Our shiny new center to someone

04:39.324 --> 04:40.658
With a lot of dirt on his hands.

04:40.725 --> 04:42.660
You sound like you're
channeling liza hearne.

04:42.727 --> 04:45.262
Well, when you're the former dcs

04:45.330 --> 04:47.665
And your most notable
stat is that you ran

04:47.732 --> 04:50.334
More dark ops than anyone
since the cold war,

04:50.402 --> 04:54.338
There's gonna be some commentary.

04:54.406 --> 04:57.007
Hey, you know the story about
henry and jai's mom, right?

04:57.075 --> 04:58.509
No.

04:58.577 --> 05:00.778
Well, she was his asset when
he was stationed in india.

05:00.846 --> 05:02.046
Her cover was blown.

05:02.113 --> 05:03.747
Henry married her.

05:03.815 --> 05:05.583
They became the romeo and
juliet of the agency.

05:05.650 --> 05:07.718
That's romantic.

05:07.786 --> 05:09.386
It was until he left
her for a younger woman

05:09.454 --> 05:10.788
And then it just became a cliche.

05:10.856 --> 05:12.656
Don't you think you're
being a little harsh?

05:12.724 --> 05:14.325
I'm being easy.

05:14.392 --> 05:16.227
Remember, we are
referring to the man

05:16.294 --> 05:17.728
Who is affectionately
known by half the press

05:17.796 --> 05:21.365
As "the prince of darkness."

05:21.433 --> 05:24.001
I'm assuming by the sudden silence

05:24.069 --> 05:25.803
And the stiletto in my shin,

05:25.871 --> 05:27.538
Jai has joined us.

05:27.606 --> 05:30.107
My favorite was always "
satan's little helper."

05:30.175 --> 05:31.876
Has such a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

05:31.943 --> 05:34.478
Well...

05:34.546 --> 05:39.950
I'm off to do anything else.

05:40.018 --> 05:41.619
What's your father doing here?

05:41.686 --> 05:44.154
Going over details
of the dedication.

05:44.222 --> 05:46.824
Aka, making arthur's life

05:46.892 --> 05:47.958
As much of a hell as possible.

05:48.026 --> 05:49.894
Mm.

05:49.961 --> 05:51.495
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

05:51.563 --> 05:53.797
Regale you with stories
of henry the terrible?

05:53.865 --> 05:55.966
I think I would need alcohol
to hear those stories.

05:56.034 --> 05:57.067
Perfect.

05:57.135 --> 05:58.168
Allen's tavern after work.

05:58.236 --> 06:01.672
Are you asking me on a date?

06:01.740 --> 06:02.973
Trust me.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.041
If I was asking you out on a date,

06:04.109 --> 06:05.609
You'd know it.

06:05.677 --> 06:07.745
And our first date will
not be at allen's tavern.

06:07.812 --> 06:10.981
What makes you think we're
gonna have a first date?

06:11.049 --> 06:12.683
You're the one who
brought up dating.

06:12.751 --> 06:15.152
I just brought up drinks.

06:15.220 --> 06:17.054
I have some work to do.

06:17.122 --> 06:21.525
Don't you have some work to do?

06:21.593 --> 06:24.328
Enjoy that ride out to mcauley's.

06:36.341 --> 06:38.609
Whoa.

06:57.395 --> 06:59.596
Holly, holden, down.

07:06.671 --> 07:08.005
You want to get off my property?

07:08.073 --> 07:10.641
Mr. Mcauley,
my name is annie walker.

07:10.709 --> 07:12.910
I'm from-- - langley.

07:12.978 --> 07:14.211
We need your help.

07:14.279 --> 07:15.713
Is there somewhere
we could go and talk?

07:15.780 --> 07:17.915
Get off my property.

07:17.983 --> 07:20.985
Well, I have a flat tire.

07:21.052 --> 07:24.455
Well, then I hope
you have a spare.

07:24.522 --> 07:28.492
Joan, dutch
intelligence came through.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.027
The guard who works
the entrance gate

07:30.095 --> 07:33.197
At richards bay turned out
to be hasaan's cousin-in-law.

07:33.264 --> 07:35.332
Well, now we know why
they chose jo'burg.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.134
They turned him.

07:37.202 --> 07:38.635
He's family and we got to him?

07:38.703 --> 07:40.004
Money's thicker than blood.

07:40.071 --> 07:42.206
According to our friendly snitch,

07:42.273 --> 07:45.109
Hasaan arrived with the weapons
before the shipyard opened.

07:45.176 --> 07:47.711
When the sudanese left,
they were short

07:47.779 --> 07:49.046
Four men and three crates.

07:49.114 --> 07:50.414
Hasaan was one of the missing men.

07:50.482 --> 07:52.516
He's coming in with the weapons?

07:52.584 --> 07:54.551
Unless we can figure
out which ship he's on,

07:54.619 --> 07:56.253
We are gonna lose
one of the world's

07:56.321 --> 07:59.456
Most notorious arms dealers
inside the United States.

08:25.433 --> 08:29.979
www.addic7ed.com

09:05.251 --> 09:07.185
Hey.

09:07.253 --> 09:08.786
You're ridgebacks.

09:08.854 --> 09:11.956
You're not dobermans.

09:16.762 --> 09:20.365
Least I can turn two dogs.

09:43.989 --> 09:47.191
Mr. Mcauley!

10:01.407 --> 10:03.975
Nice place.

10:04.043 --> 10:09.881
I like the whole
recluse-in-the-woods motif.

10:09.948 --> 10:11.883
And your dogs are sweet.

10:11.950 --> 10:13.785
I can't help you.

10:13.852 --> 10:15.320
Can't or won't?

10:15.387 --> 10:18.022
Both.

10:18.090 --> 10:19.524
How'd you know I
was from langley?

10:19.591 --> 10:22.493
With that suit on,
you got to either be

10:22.561 --> 10:25.029
From the cia or you're out here
trying to sell me insurance.

10:25.097 --> 10:29.300
I'm guessing you're new.

10:29.368 --> 10:31.969
They always send the
newbies out here to try.

10:32.037 --> 10:33.171
You're a little older, so...

10:33.238 --> 10:35.206
I'm assuming they brought you in

10:35.274 --> 10:38.009
For your language skills
instead of recruiting you

10:38.077 --> 10:42.513
Straight out of school.

10:42.581 --> 10:45.583
We have a weapons shipment.

10:45.651 --> 10:47.318
How nice for you.

10:47.386 --> 10:48.519
This is important.

10:48.587 --> 10:52.490
It's always important.

11:06.138 --> 11:10.475
Who taught you that?

11:10.542 --> 11:12.377
Whatever your personal
feelings about the cia,

11:12.444 --> 11:14.512
This is bigger.

11:14.580 --> 11:15.980
It's a greater good.

11:16.048 --> 11:17.548
You want me to tell
you how many crimes

11:17.616 --> 11:19.817
Have been perpetrated in the
name of the greater good?

11:19.885 --> 11:21.352
Who gets to decide what's greater?

11:21.420 --> 11:22.553
What's good?

11:22.621 --> 11:26.524
You? Langley?

11:26.592 --> 11:28.292
You feel that mud on
your feet right now?

11:28.360 --> 11:30.328
That's the only kind
of mud I like feeling.

11:30.396 --> 11:33.865
I'll take a pass on the other kind.

11:33.932 --> 11:38.102
What is the other kind?

11:38.170 --> 11:42.006
Ask henry wilcox.

12:04.229 --> 12:06.330
Take the end...

12:06.398 --> 12:09.066
Wrap it around the
main line three times.

12:09.134 --> 12:12.637
Where did you learn
about fly fishing?

12:12.704 --> 12:16.741
Summers in montana
with my cousins.

12:20.446 --> 12:22.947
I spent summers
on a military base.

12:23.015 --> 12:24.949
Military brat?

12:25.017 --> 12:28.286
When I finished school,
I wanted to just pick a place

12:28.353 --> 12:31.355
And go there 'cause I wanted to,

12:31.423 --> 12:33.391
Not 'cause my father
got stationed there.

12:33.459 --> 12:38.362
I wanted to make my
own choices for once.

12:38.430 --> 12:42.967
Be the master of my own destiny.

12:43.035 --> 12:44.302
That sounds pretty dumb.

12:48.740 --> 12:52.577
No.

12:52.644 --> 12:55.112
Why are you here?

12:55.180 --> 12:58.349
Kind of for the same reasons.

13:30.816 --> 13:34.151
Hello, my friend.

13:34.219 --> 13:37.021
I- I-I did not expect to
see you again so soon.

13:37.089 --> 13:42.560
Or ever... I would imagine.

13:42.628 --> 13:46.764
What are you doing in my house?

13:46.832 --> 13:50.101
Where is...

13:50.168 --> 13:55.239
Hasaan waleed?

14:24.870 --> 14:26.037
Last chance.

14:26.104 --> 14:30.641
Where is...Hasaan waleed?

14:43.889 --> 14:46.190
Stop staring at him.

14:46.258 --> 14:47.558
How do--

14:47.626 --> 14:49.226
How do you know I'm staring?

14:49.294 --> 14:51.262
Because you haven't
responded to any

14:51.330 --> 14:54.699
Of my clever remarks since
he walked in ten minutes ago.

14:54.766 --> 14:56.367
Now since when are
you so interested

14:56.435 --> 14:58.169
In henry wilcox?

14:58.236 --> 15:01.272
Or is it jai?

15:01.340 --> 15:03.341
I'm shooting you a
dirty look right now.

15:06.211 --> 15:08.045
So do you think it was
wise to come back from london

15:08.113 --> 15:10.781
At the personal request
of arthur campbell?

15:10.849 --> 15:12.350
Why do you always
feel the need to give me

15:12.417 --> 15:13.451
Career advice after the fact?

15:13.518 --> 15:14.485
It isn't advice.

15:14.553 --> 15:17.488
It's criticism.

15:17.556 --> 15:20.224
Mcauley said,
"talk to henry wilcox."

15:20.292 --> 15:21.659
Yes, but he meant it in a

15:21.727 --> 15:23.961
"go screw yourself" kind of way.

15:24.029 --> 15:25.563
I'm gonna do it.

15:25.631 --> 15:27.198
Ofourse you are and
I'm gonna sit here

15:27.265 --> 15:28.566
All alone by myself.

15:28.634 --> 15:29.900
Ah, please.

15:29.968 --> 15:32.637
There will be a girl here
before I cross the bar.

15:37.009 --> 15:38.309
Hi.

15:38.377 --> 15:40.244
Hi.

15:40.312 --> 15:42.046
Thought I'd take you up

15:42.114 --> 15:43.714
On your invitation from earlier.

15:43.782 --> 15:47.518
Annie, um, this is
my father henry wilcox.

15:47.586 --> 15:48.753
Dad, annie walker.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.121
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

15:50.188 --> 15:52.089
Miss walker.

15:57.062 --> 15:58.029
What's your pleasure?

15:58.096 --> 15:59.296
Scotch.

16:08.173 --> 16:11.742
You disapprove of me.

16:11.810 --> 16:13.878
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

16:13.945 --> 16:15.312
It's okay.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.715
Everyone disapproves of me,

16:17.783 --> 16:20.918
Present company included.

16:20.986 --> 16:22.420
You all think everything
is black and white,

16:22.487 --> 16:24.255
Good versus evil.

16:24.322 --> 16:26.023
That's why you joined up, right?

16:26.091 --> 16:27.892
Take down the bad guys.

16:27.959 --> 16:29.093
Better than letting
the bad guys win.

16:29.161 --> 16:31.762
Precisely.

16:31.830 --> 16:34.365
And sometimes,
to make that happen--

16:34.433 --> 16:37.101
You got to get in the mud.

16:37.169 --> 16:41.072
We're all in the mud,
miss walker...

16:41.139 --> 16:42.573
Even if we don't want to admit it.

16:42.641 --> 16:46.744
Sometimes we have to do things
we don't want people to see.

16:46.812 --> 16:49.080
If you can't live with that...

16:49.147 --> 16:53.384
Leave.

16:53.452 --> 16:55.720
You think that's
why people leave?

16:55.787 --> 16:57.154
Some.

16:57.222 --> 17:01.892
But not if they made it
past the first few years.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.528
Why do they leave after that?

17:04.596 --> 17:06.830
Money or love.

17:06.897 --> 17:09.133
Well, that's it?

17:09.201 --> 17:11.102
Oh, there are a million
different reasons,

17:11.169 --> 17:13.471
But, uh, almost all of them,

17:13.538 --> 17:15.306
When you really get
past the excuses

17:15.373 --> 17:19.242
And the anger...

17:19.310 --> 17:23.314
People leave for money...

17:23.381 --> 17:25.950
Or love.

18:25.210 --> 18:27.478
What are you doing here?

18:27.546 --> 18:31.248
Putting career advancement
over my personal life.

18:31.316 --> 18:32.716
Plus, she couldn't
remember the name

18:32.784 --> 18:38.122
Of the last book she read
and even I have standards.

18:38.190 --> 18:39.590
Want to talk about it?

18:39.658 --> 18:41.325
You may not know this about me,

18:41.393 --> 18:42.860
But I'm an excellent listener.

18:42.928 --> 18:43.961
Is that so?

18:44.029 --> 18:47.832
It's in my file.

18:47.899 --> 18:49.166
How do you feel about what we do?

18:49.234 --> 18:52.570
Hmm.

18:52.637 --> 18:54.772
I mean, I know that
manipulating people

18:54.840 --> 18:58.576
For information is pretty
much my job description,

18:58.643 --> 19:02.012
But it always makes me feel--

19:02.080 --> 19:05.683
Dirty?

19:05.750 --> 19:06.984
Tell me it's worth it.

19:07.052 --> 19:09.553
Tell me what "it"
is and I'll tell you

19:09.621 --> 19:12.489
If it's worth it.

19:12.557 --> 19:15.125
I read mcauley's
file and based on what

19:15.193 --> 19:16.927
He said today,
I might have something

19:16.995 --> 19:18.429
I can use.

19:18.496 --> 19:19.964
Worth it.

19:20.031 --> 19:21.532
It'd be a huge get for
you to bring somebody

19:21.600 --> 19:24.768
Like mcauley in.

19:24.836 --> 19:26.871
We don't always get to have
everything nice and shiny

19:26.938 --> 19:28.405
And clean, but we are talking about

19:28.473 --> 19:31.742
Keeping weapons out of the
hands of terrorists here.

19:31.810 --> 19:35.079
Henry wilcox said
we're in the mud,

19:35.146 --> 19:38.482
All of us, whether we
want to admit it or not.

19:38.550 --> 19:42.152
Does that bother you?

19:42.220 --> 19:43.988
I'd like tw know how
dirty I'm gonna get.

20:15.391 --> 20:16.725
You know, tenacity might
get you points at work,

20:16.793 --> 20:19.261
But not with me.

20:19.328 --> 20:22.097
I want to talk to you
about vanessa sinclair.

20:38.281 --> 20:41.683
Everything about you
screams "go away,"

20:41.751 --> 20:43.418
But I think it's all an act.

20:43.486 --> 20:46.221
You have those big
dogs to scare people,

20:46.289 --> 20:47.489
But really they're
just sweethearts.

20:47.557 --> 20:49.424
You didn't train 'em to be vicious.

20:49.492 --> 20:51.393
I bet this shotgun
isn't even loaded.

20:55.932 --> 21:01.069
Okay, it is.

21:01.137 --> 21:05.841
Vanessa sinclair worked for
henry wilcox's albion group.

21:05.908 --> 21:08.110
Most of their work
was compartmented,

21:08.177 --> 21:13.215
So I'm guessing it was dark ops.

21:13.282 --> 21:16.017
It doesn't say
anything in your files.

21:16.085 --> 21:18.620
Just that you and she
both met in khartoum

21:18.688 --> 21:21.389
When you were young.

21:21.457 --> 21:23.892
But every vacation
you took for 20 years

21:23.960 --> 21:26.695
Was within 10 miles of
where she was operating.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.170
And the walworth county
fair happens every summer

21:35.238 --> 21:36.705
In wisconsin.

21:36.773 --> 21:40.976
Vanessa was from lake geneva,
which is about...

21:41.043 --> 21:44.813
Five miles from the fairground.

21:44.881 --> 21:46.715
She buy you that hat?

21:50.486 --> 21:53.021
I know what it's like
to hang on to a memory.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.528
So that's how you knew how to tie

21:59.595 --> 22:04.533
The rapala knot yesterday.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.767
Did you love him?

22:05.835 --> 22:07.836
The person who taught
you how to do that?

22:07.904 --> 22:10.405
Very much.

22:10.473 --> 22:13.542
Hmm.

22:13.609 --> 22:16.778
Vanessa died in the
sudan five years ago.

22:16.846 --> 22:20.882
You left the agency
soon after that.

22:20.950 --> 22:24.352
Did you love her?

22:24.420 --> 22:25.787
Very much.

22:25.855 --> 22:28.423
You feel like the
agency took her away.

22:28.491 --> 22:31.459
But the agency didn't kill her.

22:31.527 --> 22:34.129
The inquiry into her
death resulted in a name:

22:34.197 --> 22:36.131
Hasaan waleed.

22:36.199 --> 22:38.767
I know.

22:38.835 --> 22:39.835
What does it matter?

22:39.902 --> 22:42.404
He's coming to the states.

22:42.471 --> 22:45.740
If you help us, if you
talk to your old contacts,

22:45.808 --> 22:47.642
We might be able to find him.

22:47.710 --> 22:50.445
If you don't want to do
it for the greater good,

22:50.513 --> 22:54.049
Then do it for yourself.

22:54.116 --> 22:58.186
For vanessa.

22:58.254 --> 22:59.821
You think that's
gonna bring me closure?

22:59.889 --> 23:03.425
I don't know about that.

23:03.492 --> 23:07.229
But...I know staying up
here in the woods all alone

23:07.296 --> 23:09.164
Is not gonna solve anything.

23:12.935 --> 23:16.404
You're good, annie walker.

23:16.472 --> 23:19.374
You're good.

23:19.442 --> 23:24.346
You're talented enough to go
very far in this business...

23:24.413 --> 23:27.148
And foolish enough to want to.

23:33.055 --> 23:35.924
She got him.

23:35.992 --> 23:39.160
She's good.

23:39.228 --> 23:41.129
She reminds me of someone.

23:41.197 --> 23:42.497
Oh, yeah? Yourself?

23:42.565 --> 23:46.101
You.

23:46.168 --> 23:48.403
Two requests from mcauley.

23:48.471 --> 23:49.671
He says he needs to
go to new york to talk

23:49.739 --> 23:50.972
To his contact.

23:51.040 --> 23:51.973
Who is it?

23:52.041 --> 23:53.241
Still won't tell us.

23:53.309 --> 23:54.776
Once a spy, always a spy.

23:54.844 --> 23:56.077
Who you gonna send with him?

23:56.145 --> 23:57.479
He says he won't
go without walker.

23:57.546 --> 23:59.080
I tried to convince him
that devon would be better,

23:59.148 --> 24:00.916
But he's insistent.

24:00.983 --> 24:05.153
So send her,
but send jai with her.

24:05.221 --> 24:08.123
Second request,
says he needs 250k.

24:08.190 --> 24:10.158
He hasn't talked to his
asset in over three years,

24:10.226 --> 24:12.093
But thinks if he has money to offer,
he can make it work.

24:12.161 --> 24:13.895
Well, tell him to
make $100,000 work.

24:13.963 --> 24:15.130
We're in a recession.

24:15.197 --> 24:17.732
And track the money.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.468
Oh, okay, you already
thought of that.

24:20.536 --> 24:22.704
How about dinner at 8:00?

24:22.772 --> 24:25.407
Did you already think of that too?

24:29.278 --> 24:30.979
Henry wilcox is here.

24:31.047 --> 24:32.981
- Where?
- At the front gate.

24:33.049 --> 24:34.382
He's not on your schedule,
but he said

24:34.450 --> 24:35.483
He needs to talk to you.

24:35.551 --> 24:36.952
Bet he wants to complain

24:37.019 --> 24:38.586
About where the podium's
gonna be for the dedication.

24:38.654 --> 24:40.555
Play nice.

24:40.623 --> 24:42.624
Dinner at 8:00.

24:42.692 --> 24:45.560
If you're lucky.

24:45.628 --> 24:47.362
Get him in here and
find out what he wants.

24:47.430 --> 24:48.430
I got a meeting.

24:48.497 --> 24:49.431
No, you don't.

24:49.498 --> 24:51.366
Yes, I do.

24:58.441 --> 25:02.744
Hello, arthur.

25:02.812 --> 25:06.381
Sorry you kept me waiting.

25:10.953 --> 25:13.321
I always liked this view.

25:13.389 --> 25:18.460
What are you doing here, henry?

25:18.527 --> 25:21.129
It has come to my attention

25:21.197 --> 25:23.031
That one of the cases
you're working on right now

25:23.099 --> 25:25.700
Involves hasaan waleed.

25:25.768 --> 25:27.068
Who told you that?

25:27.136 --> 25:28.336
If you give hasaan to the fbi

25:28.404 --> 25:30.271
Instead of turning him,

25:30.339 --> 25:32.340
He'll disappear into
a long legal battle.

25:32.408 --> 25:33.708
Did jai tell you?

25:33.776 --> 25:35.977
Jai won't tell me what
he had for breakfast.

25:36.045 --> 25:38.413
You're not paying
attention, arthur.

25:38.481 --> 25:41.082
We can use hasaan,

25:41.150 --> 25:43.018
But not if he's behind bars.

25:43.085 --> 25:44.652
What can I do, henry?

25:44.720 --> 25:46.821
Hasaan is coming here.
It's a federal takedown.

25:46.889 --> 25:48.723
It's the law.

25:48.791 --> 25:49.958
And cut the crap.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.526
You didn't drive all
the way out here

25:51.594 --> 25:53.094
And sit with my
secretary for an hour

25:53.162 --> 25:54.496
So you could lecture
me on the difference

25:54.563 --> 25:56.664
In our perspectives.

25:56.732 --> 26:00.835
There are some stories
it will do no one any good

26:00.903 --> 26:02.570
To have out in the open.

26:09.221 --> 26:10.955
Whoa! That's a lot of money.

26:11.023 --> 26:12.423
Exactly why we don't
want it to go any place

26:12.491 --> 26:13.591
We can't find it.

26:13.658 --> 26:14.658
Where's the tracker?

26:14.726 --> 26:16.594
Look at one of the bills.

26:16.661 --> 26:19.764
There's a polycarbonate strip
on every bill uncle sam issues.

26:19.831 --> 26:21.732
To the world, the strips
on these bills look

26:21.800 --> 26:23.167
Just like every other u.
S. Treasury note.

26:23.235 --> 26:24.535
But instead?

26:24.603 --> 26:25.669
These have an rfid strip in them.

26:25.737 --> 26:27.438
It's a radio signal.

26:27.506 --> 26:29.640
Because we have 1,
000 of them all close together,

26:29.708 --> 26:31.342
We get a strong signal,
but there's nothing to find

26:31.410 --> 26:32.710
If anybody goes
looking for a tracker.

26:32.778 --> 26:34.779
Basically it's a virtually
undetectable bug.

26:34.846 --> 26:36.881
When are you gonna
start tracing it?

26:36.948 --> 26:38.516
You're walking out of
the dpd with $100,000

26:38.583 --> 26:39.717
In taxpayer money.

26:39.785 --> 26:42.653
We're tracking it now.

26:51.596 --> 26:52.863
You see him?

26:52.931 --> 26:54.532
If I haven't told
you who it is yet,

26:54.599 --> 26:55.866
What makes you think
I'm gonna tell you now?

26:55.934 --> 26:57.668
It was worth a shot.

27:02.808 --> 27:06.444
Your father's an asshole.

27:06.511 --> 27:09.080
I'm a big believer in justice.

27:09.147 --> 27:11.482
In my opinion,
henry wilcox and hasaan

27:11.550 --> 27:12.917
Should both be in prison.

27:12.984 --> 27:15.553
They can rot there together.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.655
No argument?

27:17.722 --> 27:20.224
Not from me.

27:26.331 --> 27:27.431
No, no, no, no. You stay here.

27:27.499 --> 27:28.999
What?

27:29.067 --> 27:30.301
Yeah, I'm not gonna risk
you and secret agent man here

27:30.368 --> 27:31.502
Scaring away my contact.

27:31.570 --> 27:32.703
That wasn't the plan.

27:32.771 --> 27:36.373
Yeah, well, it is now.

27:36.441 --> 27:38.042
Take it or leave it.

27:47.319 --> 27:49.353
This is absurd.

27:49.421 --> 27:51.388
I'm not even sure who
his contact is yet.

27:51.456 --> 27:57.128
Well, we're about to find out.

27:57.195 --> 27:58.796
You were recording
everything that went on

27:58.864 --> 28:00.464
In that market and
christopher didn't notice?

28:00.532 --> 28:03.434
Whoever his contact
is is on this video.

28:03.502 --> 28:04.768
Talk to me, annie.

28:04.836 --> 28:06.871
I'm sending you an
encrypted video right now.

28:06.938 --> 28:09.173
I have three possibilities
for a sudanese national.

28:09.241 --> 28:10.808
You think you can scare
me up some I.D.S?

28:10.876 --> 28:12.610
Nicely done. We're on it.

28:19.417 --> 28:22.286
You really think your
father belongs in prison?

28:22.354 --> 28:24.088
Not really.

28:24.156 --> 28:25.156
But I wasn't gonna pick a fight

28:25.223 --> 28:27.191
With our operative just then.

28:27.259 --> 28:30.694
Your father's quite a guy.

28:30.762 --> 28:32.096
That's a tactful way to put it.

28:32.164 --> 28:34.231
Is that why you spent
five years overseas

28:34.299 --> 28:38.235
And never did a rotation stateside?

28:38.303 --> 28:40.804
Have you been reading my file?

28:40.872 --> 28:43.807
Checking up on me?

28:43.875 --> 28:46.177
A copy of it might
have gone around

28:46.244 --> 28:48.779
The female operatives
when you first showed up.

28:48.847 --> 28:53.384
And what else did you find out?

28:53.451 --> 28:56.353
Your mother is a
neurosurgeon from mumbai

28:56.421 --> 28:58.722
And you're a junior
national squash player.

28:58.790 --> 29:00.925
You like lattes.

29:00.992 --> 29:03.327
My coffee preference
was in my file?

29:03.395 --> 29:05.763
No.

29:05.830 --> 29:08.666
Baristas talk.

29:11.336 --> 29:14.205
He still has the case.

29:21.313 --> 29:23.080
Five years is too long.

29:23.148 --> 29:24.215
I didn't get anything.

29:24.282 --> 29:25.482
Well, what'd he say?

29:25.550 --> 29:27.518
That he didn't trust me.

29:27.586 --> 29:28.485
I'm sorry.

29:28.553 --> 29:30.287
Now excuse me.

29:30.355 --> 29:34.325
Too much coffee.

29:34.392 --> 29:36.060
Dead end here.

29:36.127 --> 29:37.294
We have the case.
We're heading back.

29:37.362 --> 29:39.196
Didn't christopher
seem really calm?

29:39.264 --> 29:40.898
Shouldn't he have been more upset

29:40.966 --> 29:43.200
After all he said about justice

29:43.268 --> 29:45.135
And how he felt about vanessa?

30:04.356 --> 30:06.824
He's gone.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.282
- Theories?
- He stole the money himself.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.667
Just got paid and ran.

30:11.735 --> 30:13.135
Or he bought the
information from his contact

30:13.203 --> 30:14.270
And cut us out of the loop.

30:14.337 --> 30:15.738
Either way, he played us.

30:15.806 --> 30:16.906
You let him go in alone?

30:16.973 --> 30:18.641
He's a trained orative, joan.

30:18.708 --> 30:20.075
He wouldn't go in any other way.

30:20.143 --> 30:22.111
If his contact's the
one who has the money,

30:22.179 --> 30:24.113
Maybe he sold christopher
information we could use.

30:24.181 --> 30:26.182
Maybe he'll sell it again.

30:26.249 --> 30:27.583
We're not gonna get another 100k.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.119
Maybe we don't have to.

30:30.187 --> 30:33.055
They've stopped.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.557
Got a visual.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.991
Recognize him from the market.

30:36.059 --> 30:37.726
His name is sadiq misa.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.428
He owns the restaurant.

30:39.496 --> 30:41.297
Our fbi detail,
he thinks it's a front.

30:41.364 --> 30:42.731
Money laundering.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.201
Gps coming to your phone.

30:45.268 --> 30:47.670
Northwest corner of the
building off the alley.

30:47.737 --> 30:48.904
Probably an office.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.272
Target seems unaware.

30:50.340 --> 30:51.774
Place is practically empty.

30:51.842 --> 30:54.310
Okay, you're a go for
recon and recovery,

30:54.377 --> 30:56.412
But please try to get in
and out without incident.

31:30.380 --> 31:33.215
Remind me to call you next
time I'm locked out of my house.

31:39.055 --> 31:41.790
Has some cracks
in the brick here.

31:54.004 --> 31:56.906
Sadiq's been multitasking.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.265
What?

32:23.333 --> 32:25.234
Hi.

32:30.273 --> 32:31.974
We'd like to know exactly
what you told the man

32:32.042 --> 32:33.876
In the market and you can keep

32:33.944 --> 32:38.080
This very handsome bag.

32:38.148 --> 32:39.315
Just give us the
information, sadiq.

32:39.382 --> 32:41.216
We'll walk right out of here.

32:41.284 --> 32:42.451
Maybe make a quick call.

32:42.519 --> 32:45.287
Tip off the dea.

32:57.167 --> 33:00.102
<i>So the nsc andromeda docks
at the brooklyn shipyard</i>

33:00.170 --> 33:01.370
An hour from now.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.539
I've got an fbi task
force standing by.

33:03.607 --> 33:07.142
All I need is your go ahead.

33:07.210 --> 33:10.212
What?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.881
We'll do this takedown,
but without the feds.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.717
Get a special ops team set up.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.085
Arthur, we can't do that.

33:16.152 --> 33:17.353
It's outside of our jurisdiction.

33:17.420 --> 33:18.554
The fbi are ready to go.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.722
They're just waiting
for a location.

33:19.789 --> 33:20.756
They don't get that from us.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.091
I cleared this with the director

33:22.158 --> 33:23.525
Of national intelligence.

33:23.593 --> 33:25.361
The only people who'll
be at this takedown

33:25.428 --> 33:26.629
Are our people.

33:26.696 --> 33:30.599
What's going on?

33:30.667 --> 33:33.168
Just set up the ops team.

33:36.673 --> 33:38.641
Understood.

33:38.708 --> 33:41.243
Our orders are to
head back to virginia.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.145
What about mcauley?

33:43.213 --> 33:47.316
If christopher finds hasaan,
he's gonna try and kill him.

33:48.418 --> 33:49.518
What are you doing?

33:49.586 --> 33:51.086
I'm going to the shipyard.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.054
Christopher wouldn't
be in this mess

33:52.122 --> 33:53.188
If it weren't for me.

33:53.256 --> 33:54.957
You're not responsible for him.

33:55.025 --> 33:56.558
You can go to
langley if you want.

33:56.626 --> 33:59.495
I'm going to brooklyn.

34:14.244 --> 34:15.511
Do we have eyes?

34:15.578 --> 34:16.712
Just ears.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.647
Shipyard's cctv is locked off.

34:18.715 --> 34:22.451
Can't give us the coverage we need.

34:37.766 --> 34:40.235
I got a report of unidentified
persons on the scene.

34:40.303 --> 34:43.105
Description sounds
like annie and jai.

34:43.172 --> 34:48.377
What are they doing there?

34:48.445 --> 34:53.482
Team leader says there's
a third and he's armed.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.784
That must be mcauley.

34:58.288 --> 35:03.759
I suggest you go away, annie.

35:03.827 --> 35:05.394
You played me.

35:08.698 --> 35:11.433
Like you played me.

35:11.501 --> 35:14.002
I mean, wasn't this your idea?

35:14.070 --> 35:15.170
Vengeance for vanessa.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.739
My idea was for justice.

35:16.806 --> 35:17.740
Oh, really?

35:17.807 --> 35:21.310
Justice for whom?

35:23.980 --> 35:25.614
This isn't your fight.

35:25.682 --> 35:27.449
The fbi is coming.

35:27.517 --> 35:28.817
They will take him down.

35:28.885 --> 35:30.886
Hasaan will be behind bars forever.

35:30.954 --> 35:34.123
That'll never happen, honey.

35:34.190 --> 35:36.091
Hasaan's not who you think he is.

35:36.159 --> 35:37.860
He's an arms dealer.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.194
Who got his start
with cia funding

35:39.262 --> 35:40.829
And cia weapons,

35:40.897 --> 35:44.733
Who killed one of our own
when she went to work for him.

35:44.801 --> 35:45.768
Vanessa.

35:45.835 --> 35:48.971
Yeah.

35:49.038 --> 35:53.342
She went to bring him
weapons and money.

35:53.409 --> 35:55.344
But he killed her.

35:55.411 --> 35:57.679
And we-- we kept working with him

35:57.747 --> 35:59.348
Until he turned on us.

35:59.415 --> 36:01.917
Annie, they don't
want to arrest him.

36:01.985 --> 36:05.420
They want to turn him back
and leave him out there.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.730
Activity on the ship.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.932
Okay, we've got a positive I.
D. Of hasaan.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.301
Tell them to move in quietly.
We need him alive.

36:19.369 --> 36:21.236
Team lead, move in.

36:21.304 --> 36:24.940
Keep it down. Keep him alive.

36:31.881 --> 36:32.815
I'm gonna move.

36:32.882 --> 36:37.019
We won't have your back.

36:37.086 --> 36:38.887
Don't do this.

36:47.230 --> 36:48.897
Thank you.

36:50.466 --> 36:52.835
Shot fired.

36:52.902 --> 36:54.770
Move in! Move in!

36:54.838 --> 36:55.804
Hasaan's down.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.479
The order was to take him alive.

37:04.547 --> 37:08.183
Who fired?

37:09.388 --> 37:10.954
Why don't I have an answer yet?

37:11.022 --> 37:12.422
Who fired that shot?

37:12.490 --> 37:14.992
Team lead, I need an answer now.

38:29.233 --> 38:31.835
U.S. Made.

38:32.203 --> 38:34.471
The same weapons we sold to him.

38:34.538 --> 38:39.776
How are you feeling about
standing in the mud now?

38:39.844 --> 38:40.910
We owe an incalculable
debt to those

38:40.978 --> 38:42.612
That have gone before us

38:42.680 --> 38:44.481
And we're proud to stand
on their shoulders

38:44.548 --> 38:46.149
And usher in a new era.

38:46.217 --> 38:49.219
One that is marked with a
new sense of transparency,

38:49.286 --> 38:51.554
Openness, honesty,

38:51.622 --> 38:53.690
And the successful
gathering of intelligence

38:53.758 --> 38:55.925
To help protect this great nation.

38:55.993 --> 38:58.561
I'm pleased to dedicate this
new ops center to my friend

38:58.629 --> 39:01.364
And predecessor henry wilcox.

39:01.432 --> 39:03.032
congratulations, henry.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.735
Thank you, sir.

39:05.803 --> 39:07.704
Hi.

39:07.772 --> 39:09.439
She sighs.

39:09.507 --> 39:10.607
What's wrong?

39:10.674 --> 39:12.008
Mission accomplished.

39:12.076 --> 39:14.911
Greater good wins out again.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.946
I'm proud to follow in
my father's footsteps.

39:17.014 --> 39:18.748
Keep that family
legacy of service here

39:18.816 --> 39:20.850
At the cia intact.

39:20.918 --> 39:22.152
What a blowhard.

39:22.219 --> 39:23.686
He's as bad as his father.

39:23.754 --> 39:26.923
No, he isn't.

39:26.991 --> 39:29.292
You're defending him?

39:29.360 --> 39:30.927
I think he's just trying
to figure this place out

39:30.995 --> 39:33.196
Like the rest of us.

39:38.169 --> 39:40.136
You knew the weapons were ours,
didn't you?

39:40.204 --> 39:42.005
That's why you had me cut
the fbi out of the loop.

39:42.072 --> 39:45.008
And don't tell me
it's need-to-know...

39:45.075 --> 39:49.179
Because if you want this
relationship to continue,

39:49.246 --> 39:51.214
Trust me...

39:51.282 --> 39:56.986
You need me to know.

39:57.054 --> 39:58.788
Hmm.

39:58.856 --> 40:01.791
Hasaan used to be an asset.

40:01.859 --> 40:03.460
He was feeding us
information in exchange

40:03.527 --> 40:05.195
For money and supplies.

40:05.262 --> 40:07.197
He and his bosses built
their entire operation

40:07.264 --> 40:11.167
With cia funding and support,
then he turned on us.

40:11.235 --> 40:13.636
We sent an operative,
vanessa sinclair,

40:13.704 --> 40:15.371
To deliver a shipment of arms.

40:15.439 --> 40:16.906
He killed her,
then used the weapons

40:16.974 --> 40:20.743
That we'd given him to
build a terror cell.

40:20.811 --> 40:22.912
And you knew this?

40:22.980 --> 40:25.949
Oh, not till henry wilcox
sat in my office and told me.

40:26.016 --> 40:27.450
If hasaan had been
arrested by the feds

40:27.518 --> 40:28.585
And all this came to light,

40:28.652 --> 40:29.919
Can't you just see the headlines?

40:29.987 --> 40:31.788
"cia arms terrorist cell."

40:31.856 --> 40:33.256
But that was henry, not you.

40:33.324 --> 40:35.525
Oh, I never would have
survived if this had gotten out.

40:35.593 --> 40:38.628
I was here when henry
started the op.

40:38.696 --> 40:42.165
So were you.
