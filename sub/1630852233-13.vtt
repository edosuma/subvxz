WEBVTT

00:04.045 --> 00:05.922
Let me see these
permission slips to the zoo.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.173
And they better be real,
'cause I can tell

00:07.257 --> 00:10.093
- if you faked a Herbie Hancock.
- Oh, it's John Hancock.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.970
Girl, I know.
I just say whatever I want.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.596
You ain't learned that yet?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.141
Chad, did you forge
your mom's signature?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.019
No?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.687
It says "Chad's Mom."

00:20.687 --> 00:22.731
That's her name?

00:22.731 --> 00:24.149
You're staying behind
with the rest of the kids

00:24.149 --> 00:25.525
who don't have permission slips.
Come on.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.236
I love field trips.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.363
I get to do
<i>Mr. Johnson's Day Off.</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:32.824
That's when I watch
<i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off,</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:35.160
which is a movie
about a depressed kid

00:35.160 --> 00:37.287
who murders
his father's Ferrari.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.875
Mr. Johnson, sorry to interrupt
whatever this is,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.544
but these kids
need to stay with you.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.379
Well, looks like
Ava switched this day

00:46.463 --> 00:49.924
from <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</i>
to <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:51.259
Life moves pretty fast,

00:51.343 --> 00:52.677
and if you don't stop
every once in a while

00:52.761 --> 00:54.304
to take a look,
you might --

00:54.304 --> 00:56.431
Missed one.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.601
Come on in.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.408
It's zoo time!

01:15.492 --> 01:17.744
I got some free chaperones
so that I could save money --

01:17.744 --> 01:19.245
we could save money!

01:19.329 --> 01:22.248
One of whom is my daughter, Taylor.

01:22.332 --> 01:26.169
And Taylor
lives in New York City!

01:26.169 --> 01:29.839
Boo!

01:29.923 --> 01:31.257
O-Oh, sorry.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.260
I heard people booing New York,
and my instinct just kicked in.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.596
You knew
they were gonna do that.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.098
Okay, class, this is --

01:38.098 --> 01:40.016
Oh, I guess
you've already met Zach.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.686
Yeah, Scrub and Bubbles
will take that mark right off.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.855
But you got to use the foam,
not the spray.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.316
Uh, Tariq, you cannot trade
a sandwich.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.526
You need to eat
your sandwich.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.695
I pay taxes.
I ain't gotta eat no sandwich.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.613
Janine,
there can't be any mishaps.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.156
I didn't exactly
"fill out" the paperwork

01:55.240 --> 01:56.282
for the school district.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.076
Wait.
Then why are we going?

01:58.076 --> 02:00.370
'Cause I wanna go to the zoo,
so keep your man in check.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.080
Tariq's been doing great.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.290
He's been doing shows
for F.A.D.E.,

02:04.374 --> 02:06.501
that drug prevention program,
all around Philly.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.005
And he has been waking up
at 11:50

02:10.005 --> 02:11.047
to get a jump on his day.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.799
So proud.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.843
I don't know why people act like
it's hard to watch kids, anyway.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.012
Watch this. Hey,
when I move, you move.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.054
Just like that!

02:18.138 --> 02:19.222
When I move, you move.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.306
Just like that!

02:20.390 --> 02:21.683
When I move, you move.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.143
Just like that!

02:25.812 --> 02:27.105
Hold up. I'm missing a kid.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.314
This one of yours?

02:28.398 --> 02:30.692
I found him
hiding inside a trash bag.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.235
I almost threw him out.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.904
Kenny, yeah. Come on, man.
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.907
Can I go to the water zoo
instead?

02:37.991 --> 02:38.992
You mean the aquarium?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.744
N-Next time, buddy.
Go ahead, sit down.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.204
- Is Kenny okay?
- Yeah, he's...

02:43.288 --> 02:45.248
just a little nervous
about going into second grade.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.876
Oh, I get it.
New experiences can be tough.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.419
Which I get.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.254
I remember the first time
I had clam chowder.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.173
'Cause it was yesterday,
and it was awful.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.133
Hey, you know,
I'm probably gonna be

02:55.133 --> 02:56.801
Kenny's 2nd grade teacher.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.471
Why don't you just let him get
a head start with me today?

02:59.471 --> 03:01.765
- That'd be great. Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.641
Hey, Kenny,

03:03.725 --> 03:05.852
would you like to be
in my group today?

03:05.852 --> 03:08.938
Uh, not really.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.274
That's the spirit.
I got 'em.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.444
Go ahead.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.197
All right, now, has everybody
used the bathroom?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.407
This is your last chance!

03:19.491 --> 03:21.493
Were we this crazy
when I was in your class?

03:21.493 --> 03:24.120
No. And I blame
<i>Real Housewives.</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:25.455
The kids watch
with their mothers,

03:25.455 --> 03:27.999
and every season,
a new beast is created.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.751
Wha--

03:29.751 --> 03:32.504
Don't bite me with
your fake Gucci jacket!

03:32.504 --> 03:34.381
All right, sit down!
And every--

03:34.381 --> 03:36.633
Just relax, okay?
Just relax!

03:36.633 --> 03:39.094
Mrs. Howard,
I've gotta use the bathroom.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.098
Party bus!
If you're excited, say, "Yass!"

03:45.100 --> 03:47.143
Okay. What big cat's
everybody gonna see first?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.895
Lions!
- Lion! That's right.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.021
Boom.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.731
Meow, y'all!

03:51.815 --> 03:54.984
What? Ava, you really
had to change into that?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.070
Of course I did. The zoo
is a Mecca for single dads.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.905
Better pickings than
a Sunday brunch up in there.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.240
Now, who ready
for the zoo?!

04:00.240 --> 04:01.282
Me!

04:05.662 --> 04:08.289
<i>The ♪</i>

04:08.373 --> 04:12.168
<i>♪ Wheels on the bus
go round and round</i> ♪

04:12.252 --> 04:13.878
<i>Round and round ♪</i>

04:13.962 --> 04:15.422
<i>Round and round ♪</i>

04:15.422 --> 04:17.298
Okay.
So, just remember,

04:17.382 --> 04:18.591
everyone needs to be
with their buddy,

04:18.675 --> 04:20.719
and if you see someone, like,
start to meander off --

04:20.719 --> 04:22.762
- Bruh!
- What?

04:22.846 --> 04:25.265
I just got an e-mail
from F.A.D.E. headquarters.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.516
Oh, no.
Did they have a problem

04:26.516 --> 04:27.851
with one of
your performances?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.102
- Yeah.
- Oh.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.771
Yeah, they got a problem with me
not doing more of them.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.648
- Wait. What?
- Oh, man.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.568
I didn't want to jinx it
by telling you, but...

04:36.568 --> 04:37.944
they want me to do
a whole tour,

04:38.028 --> 04:39.946
like, every elementary school
in New York

04:40.030 --> 04:42.699
and record a whole album
of, like, anti-meth songs

04:42.699 --> 04:44.200
called
"Meth-od To My Madness."

04:44.284 --> 04:45.452
- Oh!
- It just got confirmed.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.745
Oh, my goodness!

04:46.745 --> 04:47.996
Everybody catchin'
F.A.D.E. fades.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.914
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh, Tariq!

04:49.998 --> 04:52.125
- This is incredible!
- I know, it's wild.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.753
It's crazy to think that I,
Tariq Temple,

04:54.753 --> 04:57.547
could single-handedly stop
drug use in all of America.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.633
Well, I am really proud
of you, baby.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.218
This is everything
you've been working for.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.803
It's everything
we've been working for.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.013
- Yeah.
- This is crazy.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.098
So, does this mean
that you're going to be

05:07.182 --> 05:09.100
working full-time
in New York City?

05:09.184 --> 05:11.644
I mean, yeah, at least for,
like, the next year, right?

05:11.728 --> 05:14.356
You know.
Whoo!

05:14.356 --> 05:16.566
Jadakiss don't even know,
but we 'bout to have, like,

05:16.566 --> 05:18.443
the craziest rap beef
in rap beef history.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.278
'Cause you know,
he stole my laugh.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.155
A-ha! A-ha!

05:22.155 --> 05:24.240
She doesn't know
about that. Yeah.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.659
Well, this is just such
amazing news, Tariq. Wow.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.702
Yeah.
I gotta call 'em back.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.790
- We moving to New York, baby!
- Wait. What?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotta
talk to, uh, Mr. F.A.D.E.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.919
What do you mean
there's no Mr. F.A.D.E.?

05:40.632 --> 05:43.093
- Two, three...
- There you go. Right there.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.220
Yeah.
When I move, you move.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.805
Just like that!

05:46.805 --> 05:48.098
- Uh, yeah, that's all of them.
- Yeah.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.516
- I can hear it.
- Come on, let's go.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.976
- Come on, guys.
- Okay. So, what's your plan?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.104
I don't know.
I mean, New York is really far.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.230
Far for me, anyway.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.148
I've never lived anywhere
outside of Philly.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.942
And, I don't know,
there are a lot of schools there

05:58.942 --> 06:00.360
that could use
a teacher like me.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.613
But I just refilled
my transit pass, and...

06:03.697 --> 06:05.532
I don't know, maybe this is
just, like, that moment --

06:05.532 --> 06:08.034
Okay. I just meant what exhibit
did you plan on hitting first?

06:08.118 --> 06:10.912
Oh, um, the flamingos?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.664
Oh, hey, 'Neen!

06:12.664 --> 06:14.749
That's the best neck
I ever seen. Look.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.627
Come on.
Okay, kids, come on.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.296
Let's play a game called
"How many animals do you spot

06:20.380 --> 06:22.799
on the way to getting
Ms. Schemmenti a hot pretzel?"

06:22.799 --> 06:25.010
This one looks best on me.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.637
Now take a candid of me
walking in,

06:27.721 --> 06:28.847
and I'll tell you when.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.571
Oh!

06:44.571 --> 06:45.655
You like dancing?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.782
Well, this dance is called
"the vac it up."

06:49.034 --> 06:50.702
I heard it's going viral.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.954
You, plug it in.

06:53.038 --> 06:57.584
I want y'all to take turns
and have fun.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.713
All right, children, get ready
to see my favorite animal --

07:01.713 --> 07:03.089
the tuatara!

07:03.173 --> 07:05.550
It's a lizard that arrived here
at the zoo

07:05.550 --> 07:07.927
the same year
I started teaching.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.557
What? Where's...

07:12.557 --> 07:15.018
Oh, excuse me.
Where's Duster?

07:15.018 --> 07:16.186
Oh, he's in a reserve.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.521
When the stimulation here
gets to be too much,

07:18.605 --> 07:20.565
- we retire them.
- Retire them?

07:20.565 --> 07:23.401
But he's been here
as long as I've been coming.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.569
Cycle of life.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.071
Oh.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.618
Melissa, they have retired
my Duster.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.495
Retired
like my Uncle Anthony

07:33.495 --> 07:35.622
or retired
like my Uncle Tony?

07:37.332 --> 07:38.500
It's just a lizard, Barb.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.835
Duster is a tuatara.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.963
He is an institution that
I have been coming here to visit

07:44.047 --> 07:45.465
for 30 years.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.634
He's been working
as long as I have!

07:47.634 --> 07:49.010
Retirement?

07:49.094 --> 07:51.012
Okay, guys, let's give
Mrs. Howard a minute.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.056
Move out.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.600
And that is how birds
are related to dinosaurs.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.936
Ooh!

07:57.936 --> 08:00.730
Theropods, to be exact,
which means they're bipedal.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.273
Come on. Do your job, son.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.234
Macaws need a variety...

08:04.234 --> 08:06.277
Hey.
Kenny, how you doing?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.738
You, uh, enjoying learning
about that bird life?

08:08.822 --> 08:09.989
I guess.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.784
You know, Kenny,
I hear you're worried

08:12.784 --> 08:15.328
about going to
the second grade.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.205
But it really isn't
that big a change.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.165
It's, like,
two nickels' worth.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.792
Yeah, you'll have
all the same friends,

08:20.792 --> 08:22.585
and it'll be
in the same place.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.422
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.715
That's good, I guess.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.384
Yeah, it isn't like
you'd be moving to a new city

08:29.384 --> 08:32.470
where you maybe don't know
anyone except for one person.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.638
And maybe that person
isn't even thinking

08:33.722 --> 08:35.265
about how this
is gonna affect you.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.851
It's just crazy.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.149
All right. Let's regroup
after the bird show, all right?

08:44.149 --> 08:45.859
That's a parakeet.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.115
How's Kenny?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.742
Oh.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.494
He's okay. Um...

08:56.578 --> 08:59.456
Definitely scared,
but I get it.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.541
Change can be scary.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.334
But you know that
better than anyone --

09:03.418 --> 09:04.377
you know, as a sub.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.962
You're here one day

09:06.046 --> 09:07.714
and in a totally different
school tomorrow.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.550
Well, not anymore, actually.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.971
Just got this today.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.392
You're full-time?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.394
Yeah, Abbott
is a special place.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.646
And you helped me realize that,
so thank you.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.484
Yeah.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.111
Is there a skunk around here?
Because my eyes are watering.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.409
I got you
a clam chowder

09:36.493 --> 09:37.702
since you loved it
so much yesterday.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.287
Oh!

09:39.371 --> 09:41.790
They sell clam chowder
at the zoo?

09:41.790 --> 09:43.750
In -- In a bowl
you can eat.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.085
Yay!

09:45.085 --> 09:46.795
And it helps
with the search for food.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.089
And that's why you don't feed
a bird any meat, kids,

09:49.089 --> 09:51.299
because then they'll revert back
into a T. Rex.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.884
Now, who wants to go
on a real tour?!

09:52.884 --> 09:54.010
Come on!

09:54.094 --> 09:55.845
I'm about to show y'all
how I do.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.598
I should probably go with her

09:58.682 --> 10:00.767
so they don't wind up
on the news.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.437
- You -- Do you want some?
- No, I just had some.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.690
- You sure?
- It's all for you.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.651
I heard about Tariq's
new gig.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.361
The zoo is buzzing.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.239
Yeah. I'm really happy
for Tariq.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.409
Can't imagine Abbott
without you.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.831
I really can't imagine
not being at Abbott.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.291
I can't, um...

10:27.001 --> 10:31.339
I'm -- I'm gonna go, uh,
find some, uh, hippos.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.717
Um... Guys.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.721
Careful.
Slow down, now.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.305
Careful, careful.

10:42.684 --> 10:46.354
Are you at least having
a good day at the zoo, Barb?

10:46.438 --> 10:49.024
You know, one of the last things
I get to do with my students

10:49.024 --> 10:50.817
before they move on
to first grade

10:50.817 --> 10:53.987
is to come out here
and visit with Duster,

10:53.987 --> 10:56.489
and class after class,
they graduate,

10:56.573 --> 11:00.118
and it seems like ol' Barbara
is in the same place.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.746
And... I just don't know

11:02.746 --> 11:04.914
if I have the energy
for this anymore.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.001
Maybe I should
just move on.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.920
Wow. Been kind of thinking
the same thing lately.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.465
What, you're thinking about
quitting teaching?

11:13.465 --> 11:15.342
No. I'm thinking about --

11:15.342 --> 11:16.926
Wait, you're thinking about
quitting teaching?

11:17.010 --> 11:17.969
Yeah, you know,

11:18.053 --> 11:20.013
none of these dinosaurs
is actually real, you know,

11:20.013 --> 11:21.389
or else we'd all be a meal.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.016
Oh, wait! That's a bar.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.101
You know, dinosaurs,
they been extinct,

11:25.185 --> 11:27.354
went bye bye bye like NSYNC.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.356
T. Rex, he's the meanest,
got little arms,

11:29.356 --> 11:30.899
can't even touch his --
Tariq! Tariq.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.278
...head...because
all the dinosaurs is dead.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.030
Except me. Rawr!

11:37.030 --> 11:39.366
Raar! Raar!

11:40.909 --> 11:41.951
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.078
This is fun.

11:43.078 --> 11:45.038
I wanted to talk to you
about New York.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.081
Yes, yes, okay.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.791
So, I've been looking at
some apartments

11:47.791 --> 11:50.710
and seeing the pricing, and,
whoa, buddy, can't swing that.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.212
- Yeah.
- So I've been looking at

11:52.212 --> 11:54.964
some really roomy closets
in, like, Bushwick.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.716
- You know?
- This is, um...

11:56.800 --> 11:59.052
It's a really big conversation.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.553
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.597
And, look, I don't want to
force any decisions

12:02.681 --> 12:03.640
on your behalf.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.683
You know I'm a feminist.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.768
That's why I let you pay
for all my stuff, and --

12:06.768 --> 12:08.228
Yeah,
and I appreciate that.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.563
Um, it's just that...

12:10.647 --> 12:11.898
you know how much
I love my job,

12:11.898 --> 12:13.316
and you know how much
I love Philly.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.651
And, um...

12:15.652 --> 12:17.362
What are you thinking,
'Neen?

12:17.362 --> 12:18.530
Just...

12:18.530 --> 12:21.908
You know how when a butterfly
comes out of its cocoon?

12:21.908 --> 12:25.453
Are we talking, like,
monarch butterfly?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.247
No, I, um...

12:27.247 --> 12:29.749
I guess what I'm saying...

12:32.419 --> 12:33.920
You know what?
Never mind.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.964
Cool.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.924
Wait, I think
you're missing a kid.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.468
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:40.552 --> 12:41.678
When I move, you move!

12:41.678 --> 12:43.888
Just like that!

12:43.972 --> 12:45.974
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're down one backup singer.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.101
That's supposed to have
more bass in it.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.270
Kenny!

12:50.270 --> 12:51.646
Yes, yes, Kenny.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.940
That's my bass. Kenny.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.192
Oh, my God.
We lost Kenny.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.778
I lost Kenny. I lost a kid.
I'm negligent.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.905
Damn. You're supposed to be
the boring, dependable one.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.449
This is an unsanctioned
field trip.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.867
I'm not doing
jail time for you.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.910
Melissa, get zoo security
to make an announcement.

13:05.994 --> 13:06.995
- On it.
- Jacob, Zach,

13:06.995 --> 13:09.039
I need you to check the buses thoroughly,

13:09.039 --> 13:10.165
- then stand near the exit.
- Let's go.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.250
Gregory, Janine,
check the zoo balloon

13:12.250 --> 13:14.127
in case Kenny goes airborne.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.754
- Kids love balloons.
- Okay.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.838
Tariq, Ava, stay here

13:16.838 --> 13:18.131
- with the other children.
- Kenny!

13:18.131 --> 13:19.507
- Got it.
- Taylor, watch them.

13:19.591 --> 13:20.675
Kenny!
Y'all stay

13:20.759 --> 13:23.053
together now.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.804
Kenny!

13:24.888 --> 13:26.890
Kenny?
Oh, my God.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.309
I cannot believe
I lost him.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.477
- What I was thinking?
- It's all right.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.270
Kenny!

13:32.354 --> 13:33.313
I have been through this
many times before.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.024
The worst was 2005.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.027
A child by the name of August
got lost in The Hershey Factory,

13:39.027 --> 13:41.029
looking for a chocolate river.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.447
Mnh!

13:46.242 --> 13:48.495
Kondo, you so crazy.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.330
I am so bored.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.623
Oh, you're bored?

13:51.623 --> 13:54.751
Then write me a one-page essay
due by the end of the day.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.419
About what?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.171
Um, how about
superheroes?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.257
Can I just draw?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.093
Whatever it takes
to keep you out of my hair.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.261
Sir, you are bald.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.309
Kenny!

14:11.393 --> 14:13.103
Kenny.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.271
Gregory, I found him.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.148
- I got it, I got it.
- Uh, are you sure?

14:17.232 --> 14:19.192
Yeah. Hey, Kenny.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.444
We were so worried about you.
Are you all right?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.447
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.074
- Hey, uh, excuse me, sir.
- Hmm?

14:26.074 --> 14:27.826
- We -- We need to get off.
- Too late, little lady.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.327
As the saying goes,

14:29.411 --> 14:32.205
once the gate's closed,
it's away we goes!

14:41.589 --> 14:43.008
Well, this should be interesting.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.135
Janine was afraid of heights
going up a ladder,

14:45.135 --> 14:46.886
and now she's much higher.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.763
Over there is
the new Schuylkill Boardwalk.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.265
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.558
Hey, could you let go
of my hand, please?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.809
- Oh.
- Check that out if you can.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.561
Are you afraid,
Ms. Teagues?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.147
Yes. Ms. Teagues
is afraid of heights.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.189
You know,
I gotta tell you,

14:58.273 --> 15:00.483
watching you snap
into Super Barbara Mode,

15:00.567 --> 15:02.318
that really took me back

15:02.402 --> 15:03.903
to when we started working
at Abbott.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.573
That was back when I used to
dress like Janine.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.161
You're not
a turturro.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.413
- Tuatara.
- Whatever.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.874
My point is,
unlike the fancy lizard,

15:15.874 --> 15:18.918
no one's gonna take you
and put you in the back.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.337
I mean, it's up to you.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.673
My opinion --
you've gotten better with age.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.841
Like good wine

15:24.841 --> 15:26.426
and Stanley Tucci.

15:28.428 --> 15:33.266
Well, you know, maybe one day,
I will pack it in.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.728
But today
is not that day.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.979
Mnh-mnh.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.898
Is that a water ice?

15:39.898 --> 15:43.276
I was looking for the kid
while I was getting it.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.987
Kenny, it was very scary
when you ran away.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.489
Everyone was worried
about you.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.282
And we need to get off
this balloon.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.744
Look, second grade
is gonna be incredible.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.080
You're gonna love it
just as much as first grade --

15:55.080 --> 15:56.873
maybe even more.

15:56.873 --> 16:02.629
And sometimes, the best things
you can ever do are...

16:02.629 --> 16:04.047
the scary things.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.133
And they help you grow.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.927
You can see William Penn
really well from up here.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.971
And you're gonna have
a pretty cool teacher

16:12.055 --> 16:15.141
to help you
every step of the way.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.311
So we're gonna do this
together, you know?

16:18.395 --> 16:22.357
We're going to love it,
even if it scares us.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.734
So now do you love
being on this balloon?

16:24.818 --> 16:25.902
No, I'm still very scared.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.488
But I'm gonna try to be brave
and stand up.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.572
Okay.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.782
Let's look over the side!

16:30.782 --> 16:32.826
Oh, da da da!
Not that brave yet.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.578
- Ms. Teagues?
- Huh?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.372
You're squeezing me.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.125
- Ohh. There we go.
- Whoo!

16:40.125 --> 16:42.335
Oh, my God.
What a ride.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.838
Did you see me up there?

16:44.838 --> 16:47.007
I am so happy
that Kenny is fine

16:47.007 --> 16:48.675
and that we're gonna get him
to the second grade,

16:48.675 --> 16:50.176
but, like, I don't know.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.761
What a rush!

16:51.845 --> 16:53.096
I can make changes.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.890
And...change is good.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.143
Everyone's making changes.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.269
I am always out of breath.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.396
It's like...
What is that?

17:01.396 --> 17:04.232
Because I feel like I should
get that checked out.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.859
Ooh!
You did that, baby.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.694
That's crazy.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.237
I was --
You was up in the sky.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.864
I was -- I was scared, honestly.
I was very scared.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.699
I started rapping
when I was scared. I was like...

17:12.699 --> 17:14.034
<i>♪ That's my little
balloon baby</i> ♪

17:14.034 --> 17:15.535
<i>♪ Stay away
from them squirrels</i> ♪

17:15.535 --> 17:17.078
<i>♪ You might get
them new rabies</i> ♪

17:17.162 --> 17:20.582
Tariq,
I'm so proud of you.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.709
You've worked really hard,

17:22.709 --> 17:24.794
and now you're getting
your big break.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.880
Well, you know,
it's a little break,

17:26.880 --> 17:30.008
but I'm grateful for it,
like how I'm grateful for you.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.096
Tariq, I think our lives
are going down different paths.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.061
I think we should
take a break.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.813
A break from what,
'Neen?

17:46.483 --> 17:48.568
I don't want to move
to New York.

17:48.568 --> 17:52.447
So...you want to do
long distance?

17:52.447 --> 17:55.283
No. I want us
to take a break

17:55.367 --> 17:58.244
for the time
that you're in New York.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.374
I'm sorry.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.209
We've been together
since bag lunches.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.251
- Like...
- I know.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.087
I'm jelly,
you're peanut butter.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.047
I know, Tariq.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.675
I-I don't...

18:11.675 --> 18:13.927
What did that Kenny kid
say to you in the balloon?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.512
I knew he wasn't my dawg.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.682
I think we have
this opportunity

18:18.682 --> 18:21.309
to figure out who we are
without each other.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.977
I know I need that time.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.490
So, can I use that time
to smash other people or nah?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.203
Mm.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.417
- One last one for the road?
- Yeah.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.725
I'm so glad they found that kid.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.394
I thought I was gon'
lose my job again.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.479
Choo-choo!
All aboard the fun bus.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.522
Come on!

19:07.522 --> 19:09.858
Now that
was a good silly voice.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.901
- Well, thank you.
- Mm. We are amused.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.905
I'm excited for next year.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.949
This is what it looks like
when I'm excited.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.034
But at the end of the day,

19:19.034 --> 19:21.453
it wasn't a hard decision
to stay here.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.329
Abbott is a special place

19:23.413 --> 19:26.249
with a lot
of really special people.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.673
You've come a long way,
Miss Teagues.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.093
And I'm happy
you're staying at Abbott.

19:38.470 --> 19:39.596
It's where you belong.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.932
Thank you, Mrs. Howard.

19:44.851 --> 19:45.977
Excuse me.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.355
Sit down!

20:13.213 --> 20:16.216
Just now, I feel like
I'm part of it.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.802
