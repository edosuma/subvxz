- Are you going to give
a speech at our divorce party?

28:43.079 --> 28:44.413
- Oh, yeah.

28:44.413 --> 28:45.781
- I think we should get Deena
ahead of this

28:45.781 --> 28:47.917
and start planning
Angelina's divorce party.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.619
Yeah, divorce party.

28:49.619 --> 28:51.587
- After you try to [bleep] me,
we'll have the divorce party...

28:51.587 --> 28:52.755
- Holy [bleep].

28:52.755 --> 28:54.090
- So you're involved
in the situation.

28:54.090 --> 28:56.058
- And then she can plan
Vinny and Angelina's

28:56.058 --> 28:57.526
engagement party.

28:57.526 --> 28:59.962
- Pauly, and a wedding,
and a wedding all together.

28:59.962 --> 29:01.530
I sense pure love.

29:01.530 --> 29:02.798
- By the time
this vacation's over,

29:02.798 --> 29:04.900
them two are going to have--

29:04.900 --> 29:07.336
- When the [bleep] goes in,
it don't want to come back out.

29:07.336 --> 29:08.804
It's sucked in the
[bleep] cyc--whatever.

29:08.804 --> 29:10.906
- Huh?
- Vortex.

29:12.508 --> 29:13.776
They become my boyfriend.

29:13.776 --> 29:14.910
They don't ever
want to leave it.

29:14.910 --> 29:16.212
- Huh?
- I missed that.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.647
What was that?

29:17.647 --> 29:18.714
- A guy [bleep] like this

29:18.714 --> 29:19.682
the minute I sit
on top of them.

29:19.682 --> 29:20.850
- Huh?
- Vortex.

29:20.850 --> 29:22.952
- Huh?

29:22.952 --> 29:26.055
- Earmuffs, my love.
Earmuffs, earmuffs.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.136
<i>- The time

29:30.136 --> 29:31.738
them two are going to have--

29:31.738 --> 29:33.139
- When the [bleep] goes in,

29:33.139 --> 29:34.440
it don't want to come back out.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.275
It's sucked in--

29:36.275 --> 29:37.844
- Huh?
- Vortex.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.312
- Vortex?

29:39.312 --> 29:42.014
- Vinny and Angelina
just need to do sex already.

29:42.014 --> 29:45.818
Like, maybe if they do sex,
they'll be, like, normal.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.086
- This is just music
to my ears.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.388
This is romance to me.

29:48.388 --> 29:49.555
- You've got to be
a little bit more soft.

29:49.555 --> 29:50.523
- It gets sucked...
- Yeah, yeah.

29:50.523 --> 29:51.657
- In the vortex.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.025
- You've got
to be like a female,

29:53.025 --> 29:54.193
like, be a little soft.
- Yeah, she's like...

29:54.193 --> 29:55.361
[growling voice]
Once the [bleep] goes in,

29:55.361 --> 29:56.496
it gets sucked
right in there, boy!

29:56.496 --> 29:59.232
- [laughs]
- Now that's sexy to me.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.266
- See, it should.
Thank you.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.268
Finally.
- Oh, man.

30:02.268 --> 30:03.569
- Least I'm being honest.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.872
- Vinny pretends
that he's not into Angelina,

30:05.872 --> 30:08.908
<i>but he always does, like,
this flirty face to her.</i>

30:08.908 --> 30:11.010
Like, he'll say something,
and then look at her like--

30:11.010 --> 30:13.579
like, waiting for her reaction.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.281
- Just get it in one more time.
Why not?

30:15.281 --> 30:16.883
I'm still convinced
that Vinny and Angelina

30:16.883 --> 30:19.285
will still become Vingelina
by the end of this trip.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.020
- Toxic, crazy girls
are usually good in bed.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.089
You just might be
the exception to that rule.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.590
- Get over yourself.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.092
- What are the odds
that you sleep with Angelina

30:26.092 --> 30:27.493
before the trip's over?

30:27.493 --> 30:29.295
- No, it's getting further
and further away.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.297
Brenda, she's got
a mind of her own.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.032
She tells me what's up.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.268

30:35.268 --> 30:37.470

Diane?

30:37.470 --> 30:39.005
- Brenda.
- Debra?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.673

- Brenda.

30:40.673 --> 30:41.774
- Brenda.

30:43.743 --> 30:45.611
[laughter]

30:45.611 --> 30:50.016
- Brenda, a cyclone, a WAP.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.484
Ugh.

30:51.484 --> 30:53.753
Do you like that name, Brenda?

30:58.658 --> 30:59.692
- See?
See?

31:02.895 --> 31:04.964
- So your vagina
is a sexy model.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.666
- Are we out of here?
- Hell yeah.

31:06.666 --> 31:07.667
Let's go.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.035
<i>No matter where we are,</i>

31:09.035 --> 31:11.404

the best Italian food.

<i>And for us to break bread

31:13.339 --> 31:15.374

room for more.

31:17.844 --> 31:20.246
Oh, [bleep].
Thank you.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.814
Honey, grab one.

You go to Little Italy,

Hold on.
I think they--

31:31.390 --> 31:32.725
- We already had pizza.
No.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.427
- Mike, we just ate a big meal.

31:34.427 --> 31:36.863

- Mike, give me one
of them pies to go, man.

31:43.836 --> 31:47.039

is the dinner after the dinner,

31:47.039 --> 31:48.441

I hope you guys
saved room because

31:51.544 --> 31:53.679

- Dessert!

31:53.679 --> 31:55.581
- Like, are you
kidding me right now?

31:55.581 --> 31:59.118
But then I'm like, OK,
I'll get some dessert.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.319

you get me my own.

Just throw it in a box--

32:05.791 --> 32:08.528

And that thing, man.

32:08.528 --> 32:09.896

- Yep.

32:09.896 --> 32:11.130

Come on, man.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.434

I'm a good spooner.

What do you need?
- He spoons, I fork.

32:22.909 --> 32:25.077
- And Mike,
Mike was a promoter.

- Angelina?

32:48.734 --> 32:51.904

I would say Uncle Nino's

32:53.573 --> 32:54.941
going to sleep
in Angelina's suite.

32:54.941 --> 32:56.709

32:56.709 --> 32:58.244
- He just told me
he wanted to [bleep] me.

32:58.244 --> 33:01.681
- I think Uncle Nino pulled
a robbery on Vinny tonight.

33:01.681 --> 33:03.516
But I'm like, "ew."

33:03.516 --> 33:04.850

33:56.729 --> 33:57.697

can you jerk off--

33:57.697 --> 33:58.798
- Oh, my.

33:58.798 --> 33:59.866
- In front

- No, no.

34:00.967 --> 34:02.135
- 'Cause he's an asshole.

34:02.135 --> 34:03.236

know how to do it.

34:03.236 --> 34:04.237
- You're gross.

34:04.237 --> 34:07.173
- Angelina tells Uncle Nino

34:07.173 --> 34:09.242
that he should masturbate
in front of me

34:09.242 --> 34:10.543
so that I learn how to do it.

34:10.543 --> 34:12.044
This is getting
really weird now.

34:12.044 --> 34:13.780
Like, this is what I mean
about Angelina having

34:13.780 --> 34:15.515
a really weird,
bad personality.

34:15.515 --> 34:17.750
You're the opposite

34:17.750 --> 34:19.485
- Vinny, blow me.

34:19.485 --> 34:21.454
- Angelina, man,
you're so pretty,

34:21.454 --> 34:23.389
but then the moment you open
your mouth, it's like--

34:23.389 --> 34:24.424
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

34:24.424 --> 34:25.958
- A [bleep] dumpster.

34:25.958 --> 34:28.628
- A personality makes
the look, the person.

34:28.628 --> 34:30.296
- Not always.

34:30.296 --> 34:31.731
- If your looks are a ten, but
your personality is a two...

34:31.731 --> 34:34.901
- My personality's fire.
- Then you become an eight.

34:34.901 --> 34:38.204
- But my personality is fire.
I don't care what anyone says.

34:38.204 --> 34:40.506
- He said that he doesn't
find her attractive.

34:40.506 --> 34:41.874
- He said she was pretty
last night, though.

34:41.874 --> 34:43.042
- Yeah.

34:43.042 --> 34:44.210
- He said
she was sexy this morning.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.178
- Oh, he's trying
to push her buttons.

34:45.178 --> 34:46.312
- It's a different tone.

34:46.312 --> 34:47.713
- I think they both
like each other.

34:47.713 --> 34:48.948
They got a ton of history,

34:48.948 --> 34:50.950
so it's going to happen.

34:50.950 --> 34:52.452
- I asked her
what are the odds

34:52.452 --> 34:55.855
them hook up this trip.
She didn't say no.

34:55.855 --> 34:57.890
- 50/50.
- Yeah.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.225
She didn't say no.

34:59.225 --> 35:00.460
He said no right away,

35:00.460 --> 35:01.894
but I think he's just
playing a game.

35:01.894 --> 35:03.663
- I think something's
going to happen.

35:03.663 --> 35:05.965
- What a weird weave we web.

35:05.965 --> 35:07.366
I think--I think
that's what it is.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.335
What a weird web--
- What a tangled web we weave.

35:09.335 --> 35:10.670
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

35:10.670 --> 35:12.171
All right, guys--

35:12.171 --> 35:13.473
- It's about that time.

35:13.473 --> 35:14.707
- Good night.
- Let's go do that.

35:14.707 --> 35:16.008
- Good night, Irene.

35:16.008 --> 35:17.477
Good night, Irene.
- We're all going to bed.

35:17.477 --> 35:18.911
- Night.
We, too.

35:18.911 --> 35:20.713
- I guess Uncle Nino
and Angelina are staying here.

35:20.713 --> 35:22.048
- I love Uncle Nino.

35:22.048 --> 35:24.517
- Uncle Nino
and Angelina are definitely

35:24.517 --> 35:26.919
cut from the same cloth,
which is,

35:26.919 --> 35:28.688
like, the cloth

35:28.688 --> 35:31.858
from a Staten Island
trash bag somewhere.

35:31.858 --> 35:34.260
- So good seeing you.
- Oh, bless you.

35:34.260 --> 35:35.862
- So good.

35:35.862 --> 35:38.631
- It takes, like, a minute or
two for the shower to warm up.

35:38.631 --> 35:40.099
- I'm going to bed.
- Oh.

35:40.099 --> 35:41.367
- I'm going to bed.
- OK.

35:41.367 --> 35:42.568
- [laughs]

35:48.941 --> 35:50.676
- Hey, where's Uncle Nino
going right now?

35:50.676 --> 35:51.811
- Wait, what?

35:51.811 --> 35:53.613
- Where's Uncle Nino
going right now?

35:53.613 --> 35:54.847
- What do you mean?
He's--

35:54.847 --> 35:56.949
- Like, where's he staying?
- I dunno.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.951
That's Vinny's concern.
I don't know.

35:58.951 --> 36:01.254
- For real.
- Thanks for coming, my dude.

36:01.254 --> 36:02.722
It was a good surprise.

36:02.722 --> 36:04.257
I never thought it'd be
a nice surprise to see you.

36:04.257 --> 36:05.691
Today was actually really fun.

36:05.691 --> 36:07.860
I'm actually kind of happy
that we saw Uncle Nino.

36:09.095 --> 36:10.363
- I was.
I was shocked.

36:10.363 --> 36:11.931
It felt good.

36:11.931 --> 36:14.367
I haven't been home in a while,
so, you know, I felt good.

36:14.367 --> 36:17.370
So yeah, listen,
Angelina, she's into you.

36:17.370 --> 36:18.971
- No, come on.
It's your girl.

36:18.971 --> 36:20.306
What the [bleep]?

36:20.306 --> 36:22.041
- No, you--'cause you know,
I'm a nice guy.

36:22.041 --> 36:24.143
Angelina has been
single and horny,

36:24.143 --> 36:27.179
<i>so what's adding Uncle Nino
as another side piece?</i>

36:27.179 --> 36:29.181
Brenda does not discriminate.
See you later.

36:29.181 --> 36:32.752
- [speaks Italian]
What does that mean?

36:32.752 --> 36:34.420
- I have no clue.

36:34.420 --> 36:35.755
- On top of you,
under you, and inside of you.

36:35.755 --> 36:36.756
- Oh, my God.

36:36.756 --> 36:39.625
- [laughs]
What the [bleep]?

36:39.625 --> 36:43.696
- So I know that Uncle Nino
has been divorced a few times.

36:43.696 --> 36:46.065
You are a horndog,
but I love you.

36:46.065 --> 36:48.100
You've also been divorced.
And--

36:48.100 --> 36:49.268
- Well, a couple of times.

36:49.268 --> 36:50.469
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:50.469 --> 36:51.737
- Was it hard for you?

36:51.737 --> 36:52.972
Or, like, you were
just, like, done?

36:52.972 --> 36:54.240
- No, done, done, done--

36:54.240 --> 36:55.641
- You were happy
when you got divorced?

36:55.641 --> 36:57.310
- No, I was just--

36:57.310 --> 36:59.579
it was what it was, you know?
- Hmm.

36:59.579 --> 37:01.047
- It had to be
what it had to be.

37:01.047 --> 37:02.114
First time
was really depressing,

37:02.114 --> 37:04.116
the first time,
but second time,

37:04.116 --> 37:06.252
I was happy
to get out of it.

37:06.252 --> 37:07.587
- Why was the first time
depressing?

37:07.587 --> 37:09.121
Like...
- 'Cause there was...

37:09.121 --> 37:10.556
- If you don't mind me asking.
- Too much, too much love.

37:10.556 --> 37:13.259
It was too--
it was too deep, too--

37:13.259 --> 37:14.594
a little personal.

37:14.594 --> 37:17.997
It was, like, very touching,
very, very--

37:17.997 --> 37:19.632
<i>- This is definitely a side</i>

37:19.632 --> 37:21.567
of Uncle Nino
I've never seen before.

37:21.567 --> 37:23.769
But, like,
that first wife was so--

37:23.769 --> 37:25.738
it was like
you really loved her.

37:25.738 --> 37:26.739
- That was
my [bleep] heart, my...

37:26.739 --> 37:27.740
- Aw.

37:27.740 --> 37:30.042
- My heart and my soul.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.243
- He's, like, heartbroken.

37:31.243 --> 37:33.045
- It's--it's a sad story,

37:33.045 --> 37:36.082
but she couldn't have
any kids...

37:36.082 --> 37:39.885
- Oh, my God.
- After years together.

37:39.885 --> 37:43.589
But she--
you know, back in 1983,

37:43.589 --> 37:45.758
nobody knew about
[bleep] vitro,

37:45.758 --> 37:48.060
this and that, whatever.
- In vitro, yeah.

37:48.060 --> 37:50.129
- Right, right.
- It wasn't big back then.

37:50.129 --> 37:51.364
- No, right.

37:51.364 --> 37:52.531
- But then technology
wasn't as good.

37:52.531 --> 37:53.599
- Exactly, so anyway--

37:53.599 --> 37:55.101
so then--
- That's sad, but--

37:55.101 --> 37:56.802
- Yeah, and I mean, I've seen--

37:56.802 --> 37:58.471
I've seen her, like, once--

37:58.471 --> 37:59.639
I've seen her
about five years ago

37:59.639 --> 38:01.707
at one of my friend's wake.

38:01.707 --> 38:03.209
And...
- Mm.

38:03.209 --> 38:04.677
- She come up to me crying.

38:04.677 --> 38:06.912
And you know, you'll always
be the love of my life.

38:06.912 --> 38:08.080
- No!

38:08.080 --> 38:09.315
- And she has
two kids now with...

38:09.315 --> 38:10.516
- I was going to--

38:10.516 --> 38:11.450
I didn't want
to backstab, either--

38:11.450 --> 38:12.752
- With vitro.

38:12.752 --> 38:14.520
- Wow, so she did have kids.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:15.921 --> 38:18.457
And what--

38:18.457 --> 38:20.259
- Feel like everything
happens for a reason.

38:20.259 --> 38:22.628
I don't know
why that happened, but--

38:22.628 --> 38:24.864
Nino has been through a lot,

38:24.864 --> 38:28.768
and it's very clear this guy
still loves his first wife.

38:28.768 --> 38:30.136
- She was my whole life.
She was my...

38:30.136 --> 38:31.237
- Aw.
Yeah.

38:31.237 --> 38:32.705
- She was everything to me.

38:32.705 --> 38:34.907
- It's actually really crazy
for me to, like,

38:34.907 --> 38:36.676
witness this right now.

38:36.676 --> 38:38.010
- Let's get back to you.

38:38.010 --> 38:39.512
- But no, I'm asking you
because I want to know,

38:39.512 --> 38:40.846
like, what happened with you.

38:40.846 --> 38:42.114
Because for me,
with this whole Chris thing,

38:42.114 --> 38:43.749
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
I didn't think

38:43.749 --> 38:46.185
it was going to be this toxic
and this, like, bad," you know?

38:46.185 --> 38:48.120
We're probably going to be
divorced in, like, two weeks.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.790
I'm like a fish out of water.
I feel weird.

38:50.790 --> 38:52.358
- You're still
going through a process.

38:52.358 --> 38:53.893
- Like--like, where do I begin
again, you know what I mean?

38:53.893 --> 38:55.261
Like, did you ever
become friends

38:55.261 --> 38:56.662
with her down the road?

38:56.662 --> 38:57.897
- She wanted to be.
She wanted to be.

38:57.897 --> 38:59.165
- And why didn't you
be friends?

38:59.165 --> 39:01.667
- No, we couldn't.
I loved her too much.

39:01.667 --> 39:03.669
I loved her too much.
- So that's what it was?

39:03.669 --> 39:04.804
Me and Uncle Nino--

39:04.804 --> 39:06.138
<i>he's helping me right now,</i>

39:06.138 --> 39:08.107
and I think I can
start moving forward.

39:08.107 --> 39:10.176
Like, you know, Uncle Nino
has done it a few times.

39:10.176 --> 39:12.178
If Nino can do it, I can do it.

39:12.178 --> 39:13.245
- Chris is a sweetheart,

39:13.245 --> 39:15.181
but he's not--
he's not for you.

39:15.181 --> 39:17.016
- Sex one time in two years?

39:17.016 --> 39:18.484
Come on.
- No, you--

39:18.484 --> 39:20.920
- On our wedding night,
we didn't even have sex.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.254
- Pfft.
- I swear.

39:22.254 --> 39:23.322
There was something off.

39:23.322 --> 39:24.457
I feel like
it's an emotional

39:24.457 --> 39:25.558
roller coaster right now.

39:25.558 --> 39:26.525
- Snap out of it.
Snap out of it.

39:26.525 --> 39:27.660
- I know.

39:27.660 --> 39:28.828
There's so many fish
in the sea.

39:28.828 --> 39:30.429
- Yeah.

39:30.429 --> 39:32.164
- But everybody wants me to get
with your--with your nephew.

39:32.164 --> 39:34.467
- I do--I do see that in
the future, with you and Vinny.

39:34.467 --> 39:35.868
You see anything happening?

39:35.868 --> 39:37.203
You see anything--

39:37.203 --> 39:40.306
- If he matured, I would--
- Forget about it.

39:40.306 --> 39:41.373
That's not--
that's not going to happen.

39:41.373 --> 39:42.541
- All right.
- [bleep] that.

39:42.541 --> 39:44.343
Forget that.
Would you sleep with him?

39:44.343 --> 39:46.645
- If he was nicer to me,
probably.

39:46.645 --> 39:48.114
But he doesn't know
how to do that.

39:48.114 --> 39:50.015
- You know, he's--
he's a child.

39:50.015 --> 39:53.552
There's a part of him
that did not [bleep] mature.

39:53.552 --> 39:56.055
And if he didn't mature by now,
he's 34 years old.

39:56.055 --> 39:57.156
It was never going to happen.

39:57.156 --> 39:59.158
- Yeah.

39:59.158 --> 40:01.594
Like, this is exactly
what I'm trying to say.

40:01.594 --> 40:03.195
Like, this is exactly
what I was getting at

40:03.195 --> 40:04.530
and I've been getting
at with Vinny.

40:04.530 --> 40:06.332
Like, he hasn't grown up yet.

40:06.332 --> 40:09.268
Maybe he needs a kick in
his [bleep], and it'll happen,

40:09.268 --> 40:11.070
you know what I mean?
Probably not.

40:11.070 --> 40:12.471
- Or a boot up his ass,
whatever.

40:12.471 --> 40:13.572
- It's not going to happen.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:13.572 --> 40:14.707
What time is it?
- Got to go.

40:14.707 --> 40:16.008
- I love you.
- I love you.

40:16.008 --> 40:17.209
Thank you for the pep talk
and everything.

40:17.209 --> 40:18.511
You're the best of the best.

40:18.511 --> 40:19.845
You would be my uncle.

40:19.845 --> 40:21.180
And don't try and make out
with me right now.

40:21.180 --> 40:22.314
- No.
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

40:22.314 --> 40:23.449

40:23.449 --> 40:24.817

[laughs]

40:24.817 --> 40:26.385

I love your butt.

40:26.385 --> 40:27.520

your [bleep] butt.

40:28.754 --> 40:29.922
