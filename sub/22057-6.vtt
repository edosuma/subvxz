<i>- I don't believe this.
- Come on.</i>

00:14.651 --> 00:16.851
I hate you. Dude, trust me.

00:16.853 --> 00:19.487
If we slept in another hour,
we'd be fighting for waves

00:19.489 --> 00:22.290
with a bunch of tourists who
don't know squat about surfing.

00:22.292 --> 00:23.758
We are tourists,

00:23.760 --> 00:25.793
and we don't know squat
about surfing.

00:25.795 --> 00:27.261
Plus, the water's freezing,

00:27.263 --> 00:30.198
and sharks like to squeeze in
a last meal before sunup.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.833
That true?

00:31.835 --> 00:34.101
Hell yeah, it's true.

00:34.103 --> 00:36.370
You gotta be kidding me.

00:36.372 --> 00:37.505
I saw it on Shark Week.

00:37.507 --> 00:38.947
No, I mean we're
getting pulled over.

00:40.076 --> 00:41.909
What did you do? Nothing.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.044
It's the end of the month.

00:43.046 --> 00:44.478
They probably got
a quota to hit.

00:47.317 --> 00:49.350
I'm gonna get this guy on video.

00:49.352 --> 00:52.386
If it's BS,
we can fight it in court.

00:59.662 --> 01:01.462
Morning, Officer.

01:01.464 --> 01:02.864
There a problem?

01:02.866 --> 01:04.364
License and registration.

01:04.367 --> 01:07.101
Sure. You mind telling me
what I did first?

01:07.103 --> 01:09.070
License and registration.

01:09.072 --> 01:11.572
Right. Of course.

01:11.574 --> 01:14.141
But again... and with
all due respect...

01:14.143 --> 01:16.010
I'd like to know why
we were pulled over.

01:16.012 --> 01:17.945
You can't light us up
for no reason.

01:19.849 --> 01:21.182
License...

01:21.184 --> 01:23.184
and registration.

01:23.186 --> 01:25.052
All right. Whatever.

01:25.054 --> 01:27.288
Listen, I'm gonna put
my hand in my pocket...

01:27.290 --> 01:28.356
Wait, hold up.

01:28.358 --> 01:30.024
We got rights here. Forget it.

01:30.026 --> 01:32.526
No, look, Officer... Mathus?

01:32.528 --> 01:34.662
Yeah, my friend will be happy
to cooperate

01:34.664 --> 01:37.031
after you tell us
what we did wrong.

01:38.835 --> 01:40.001
No, no, no...! Hey, hey!

02:39.595 --> 02:40.995
Hi, buddy.

02:40.997 --> 02:43.230
Wow. Love the smell
of wet dog in the morning.

02:43.232 --> 02:44.432
Eddie, shake. All right.

02:44.434 --> 02:46.467
What'd you do,
you teach him to do that?

02:48.404 --> 02:50.805
Or, I don't know, maybe...

02:50.807 --> 02:53.031
maybe he just doesn't like you.
You ever consider that?

02:53.032 --> 02:54.834
He loves me very much.
Don't you, buddy?

02:59.649 --> 03:01.816
What are you doing here anyway?

03:01.818 --> 03:04.418
I just came to hang out
with my BFF a little bit.

03:04.420 --> 03:05.953
What's the big deal?

03:05.955 --> 03:07.922
Did you say BFF?
Is that what you said?

03:07.924 --> 03:10.157
Yeah, my BFF. Hold that.

03:10.159 --> 03:12.026
Yeah.

03:12.028 --> 03:13.461
Okay.

03:13.463 --> 03:15.596
I... You, what?

03:15.598 --> 03:18.332
I got... I got some...

03:18.334 --> 03:19.533
WhWhat... what are you doing?

03:19.535 --> 03:21.335
Where are you going?
I'm going for a run.

03:21.337 --> 03:22.336
No, no, no. Whoa.

03:22.338 --> 03:23.604
I brought coffee and...

03:23.606 --> 03:25.373
Liliha Bakery. We'll visit.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.074
What's the matter with you?
WhWhat's going on?

03:27.076 --> 03:28.576
What do you mean,
what's going...? Why's something

03:28.578 --> 03:30.478
gotta be going on?
I brought you a coco puff.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.879
You love coco...
You already swam 19 miles.

03:31.881 --> 03:33.347
What are you going
for a run for?

03:33.349 --> 03:35.916
Come on. You don't need to run.

03:42.658 --> 03:43.991
What...

03:43.993 --> 03:45.326
What's this?

03:45.328 --> 03:47.395
Just have a seat, man. Danny.

03:47.397 --> 03:50.131
What is this?

03:50.133 --> 03:53.000
Have a seat.

03:54.504 --> 03:56.303
You're a traitor.</font>

03:56.305 --> 03:57.238
You know that?

03:57.240 --> 03:59.640
Beat it. Go on.</font>

04:03.179 --> 04:05.179
Good morning.

04:05.181 --> 04:07.748
All right. Good.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.552
First of all,
I'ml'm glad you could be here.

04:11.554 --> 04:13.120
I live here.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.322
Yes. We are all

04:15.324 --> 04:16.857
very concerned
about your health.

04:16.858 --> 04:19.427
You were recently,
diagnosed with,

04:19.428 --> 04:21.995
radiation poison...

04:21.998 --> 04:23.864
which, which means

04:23.866 --> 04:26.434
that you're at a higher risk...
Of getting cancer.

04:26.436 --> 04:29.236
That's correct, but that's...
that's not gonna happen.

04:29.238 --> 04:31.172
We're not gonna...
we're not gonna let that happen.

04:31.174 --> 04:33.774
I did some research,
and I found out

04:33.776 --> 04:35.843
there are some things...
Some steps...

04:35.845 --> 04:38.279
You can take, to insure

04:38.281 --> 04:40.815
that you are tumorfree
for the rest of the flick.

04:40.817 --> 04:42.750
I just swam two miles.
I haven't eaten anything.

04:42.752 --> 04:44.785
Can I get an egg or something?

04:44.787 --> 04:46.687
Dodo you... do you want to know
what some of those things are

04:46.689 --> 04:47.655
that I found out, oror not?

04:47.657 --> 04:49.423
No. Stress.

04:49.425 --> 04:50.825
You don't need any stress.

04:50.827 --> 04:52.860
Stress is not
your friend right now.

04:52.862 --> 04:53.994
Stress?

04:53.996 --> 04:55.563
Studies have shown
that there is a link

04:55.565 --> 04:57.164
to cancer and stress.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.733
Particularly when the thyroid

04:59.735 --> 05:01.535
has been compromised, so...

05:01.537 --> 05:03.404
a person like you
needs to eliminate

05:03.406 --> 05:06.440
all psychological stress,
if possible.

05:06.442 --> 05:08.008
Yeah.

05:08.010 --> 05:10.578
And I...
I didn't know all of that,

05:10.580 --> 05:11.979
so I appreciate the information.

05:11.981 --> 05:13.114
It's a good health tip.

05:13.116 --> 05:14.748
Good looking out, man.
Thank you.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.650
What are all these people

05:16.652 --> 05:18.152
doing in my house?

05:18.154 --> 05:19.120
Intervention.

05:19.122 --> 05:21.722
- What?
I knew that, um,

05:21.724 --> 05:23.491
if I were to tell you,
“Steve, you need

05:23.493 --> 05:24.892
to work on lowering
your stress levels,”

05:24.894 --> 05:26.727
that you're gonna make fun
of me and bust my chops,

05:26.729 --> 05:28.028
so I decided to bring in backup,

05:28.030 --> 05:30.898
and, that's what this is.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.266
Okay. Can I say something,
please?

05:32.268 --> 05:34.335
You can say anything you
want when we're done.

05:34.337 --> 05:35.836
Okay? For now,
please just zip it. Be quiet.

05:35.838 --> 05:37.138
Listen to everybody.
We're gonna go around.

05:37.140 --> 05:38.305
Everybody's gonna share.

05:38.307 --> 05:40.007
We're gonna start with Jerry.
Is that okay?

05:42.945 --> 05:45.913
Commander, I've always thought
of you as Captain America.

05:45.915 --> 05:49.183
But unlike the other Steve...
Steve Rogers, that is...

05:49.185 --> 05:50.951
You're not indestructible.

05:50.953 --> 05:52.186
Remember,

05:52.188 --> 05:55.222
“an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure.”

05:55.224 --> 05:57.391
Good.

05:57.393 --> 05:58.792
Okay.

05:58.794 --> 06:01.195
Now, Steve...

06:01.197 --> 06:02.963
you know I love you
like a brother.

06:02.965 --> 06:03.998
You know that.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.666
And, you know, at first,

06:05.668 --> 06:07.735
when Danny came to me
with this, you know,

06:07.737 --> 06:11.005
sensitive New Age
quackscience mumbo jumbo...

06:11.007 --> 06:14.608
No offense. You know
I don't go for that stuff.

06:14.610 --> 06:17.144
But I did my own research,

06:17.146 --> 06:20.714
and there is some
anecdotal evidence that is...

06:20.716 --> 06:23.651
completely proves
what Danny's saying.

06:23.653 --> 06:26.153
Okay, so why don't you
listen to your boy.

06:26.155 --> 06:27.388
You know he loves you.

06:27.390 --> 06:29.657
You'd be doing yourself a favor.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.260
Good. Thank you.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.562
Tani, you want

06:34.564 --> 06:36.030
to add something? Sure.

06:36.032 --> 06:39.934
Hi. This is really awkward
because we...

06:39.936 --> 06:42.102
let's be honest, we haven't
known each other that long.

06:42.104 --> 06:44.338
Also, you're my boss,

06:44.340 --> 06:46.273
so that's even weirder.

06:46.275 --> 06:49.577
It all comes down to the fact
that it makes sense.

06:49.579 --> 06:51.111
Doesn't it?
It's kind of a nobrainer?

06:51.113 --> 06:53.280
You reduce stress,
and then you...

06:53.282 --> 06:55.583
stay healthy... easy call... so...

06:55.585 --> 06:57.418
that's what I feel.

06:57.420 --> 06:58.953
Thank you.

06:58.955 --> 07:00.020
Good.

07:00.022 --> 07:01.422
Dog?

07:02.658 --> 07:05.125
Just for the record,
I'd like to say

07:05.127 --> 07:06.694
I was against this.

07:06.696 --> 07:08.796
Ambush a guy in his own home?

07:08.798 --> 07:10.397
Gang up on him like this?

07:10.399 --> 07:13.467
Not so cool, Williams.

07:14.737 --> 07:16.904
Isn't that what you do
every day of your life?

07:16.906 --> 07:18.572
Like, as your job...
That's what you...

07:18.574 --> 07:19.974
literally what you do?

07:19.976 --> 07:21.809
Big difference.

07:21.811 --> 07:25.813
Look, Steve, I may disagree
with the tactics

07:25.815 --> 07:27.815
but not the advice.

07:27.817 --> 07:30.317
It's time to get your
Zen on, brother.

07:33.089 --> 07:34.922
Kamekona?

07:37.560 --> 07:39.727
Because the subject
of an intervention

07:39.729 --> 07:41.795
ought to be given consequences

07:41.797 --> 07:43.797
if he don't seek help,

07:43.799 --> 07:45.032
I've decided I'm

07:45.034 --> 07:47.167
going to charge you 20% more

07:47.169 --> 07:50.771
if you don't take this
stress business seriously.

07:53.175 --> 07:56.143
You're the only person I know
that could possibly

07:56.145 --> 07:57.578
find a way to monetize this.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.247
All right, look, everybody,
I'ml'm touched. Okay?

08:00.249 --> 08:02.249
This is very, very sweet.

08:02.251 --> 08:03.884
I mean it. I really am touched.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.487
But, guys,
we're in Crazy Town here.

08:06.489 --> 08:10.391
Clearly, Danny has... he's gone
down a WebMD rabbit hole,

08:10.393 --> 08:12.493
and he's taken you all with him.

08:13.629 --> 08:15.029
What? You don't have
to raise your hand.

08:15.031 --> 08:16.597
If you want to speak,
you can just speak.

08:16.599 --> 08:18.399
Understood, sir.

08:18.401 --> 08:22.569
I just want to point out that,

08:22.571 --> 08:24.772
I've been witness to
Commander McGarrett's actions

08:24.774 --> 08:26.340
over the last several weeks,
and...

08:26.342 --> 08:28.742
from what I've seen,
I'm pretty confident

08:28.744 --> 08:30.444
he can handle
whatever life throws at him.

08:30.446 --> 08:32.046
Okay, that's good. That's...

08:32.048 --> 08:33.212
sure, that's an opinion.

08:33.215 --> 08:35.282
I respect your opinion,
but II...

08:35.284 --> 08:37.818
you don't know him
as well as I do, so...

08:37.820 --> 08:40.120
And, respectfully, I disagree.

08:40.121 --> 08:42.056
Okay. You showed... you
showed up on the doorstep

08:42.058 --> 08:44.091
just six weeks ago, though, right?
Danny.

08:44.092 --> 08:46.527
Let him speak.

08:46.529 --> 08:48.228
He can speak all
he wants. Go ahead.

08:48.230 --> 08:49.763
Yeah, II'm sorry, but,

08:49.765 --> 08:51.632
Commander McGarrett
served in combat.

08:51.634 --> 08:54.535
He lived in the crosshairs
of his enemy for years.

08:54.537 --> 08:57.438
And I know for sure that he lost
some of his team buddies.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.306
And those are things
that you take with you

08:59.308 --> 09:01.542
that can drag you down,
and from what I've seen,

09:01.544 --> 09:03.877
he's been able to
handle civilian life

09:03.879 --> 09:05.679
with great success.

09:05.681 --> 09:08.415
- My man.
- Hooyah.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.718
Youyou live here
rentfree, right?

09:10.720 --> 09:12.486
Does that have anything to do
with what you're saying?

09:12.488 --> 09:14.988
Definitely not, sir.

09:14.990 --> 09:16.590
Well, there's that.

09:16.592 --> 09:17.991
Look, Danny,

09:17.993 --> 09:20.661
I appreciate all this,
but any stress in my life,

09:20.663 --> 09:22.429
II got a handle on it, okay?
I got it.

09:22.732 --> 09:24.966
I believe that you
think that you do.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.100
Okay? II believe that.

09:26.102 --> 09:28.335
But I also think that you
might not know, right?

09:28.337 --> 09:31.405
So that's why I think
that somebody that is an expert

09:31.407 --> 09:33.107
in the field would be better

09:33.109 --> 09:36.343
to make that kind
of decision, so...

09:36.345 --> 09:39.513
we have a, um,
stressmanagement consultant

09:39.515 --> 09:41.348
to evaluate you.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.150
That's not a...
that's not a real thing.

09:43.152 --> 09:44.518
That can't be somebody's job.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.955
Actually, it is.

09:47.957 --> 09:50.691
Pleasure to meet you,
Commander. Chloe Gordon.

09:50.693 --> 09:54.695
Your friends all pitched in
to have me shadow you today,

09:54.697 --> 09:57.831
to recommend better ways
to manage your stress.

09:57.833 --> 09:58.999
You're welcome.

10:04.073 --> 10:06.373
Very nice to meet you,
Miss Gordon.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.142
Nice to meet you, too.

10:08.144 --> 10:09.710
I didn't mean to mock your job.

10:09.712 --> 10:11.945
I didn't realize
you were hiding in my kitchen.

10:11.947 --> 10:14.348
Okay, so, but...

10:14.350 --> 10:16.950
you heard what I was saying.
There'sthere's no need

10:16.952 --> 10:20.254
for your services,
because II'm not stressed.

10:20.256 --> 10:24.158
I'll admit youyou do seem
pretty relaxed.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.459
Thank you.

10:25.461 --> 10:29.396
But I'm already paid
for the day, so tell you what...

10:29.398 --> 10:31.498
Why don't you just
let me hang around?

10:31.500 --> 10:34.535
That way,
you can have the satisfaction

10:34.537 --> 10:37.237
of watching a professional
tell all your friends

10:37.239 --> 10:40.374
just how wrong they were.

10:42.311 --> 10:44.077
Okay.

10:46.849 --> 10:49.183
No problem. Excuse me. Okay.

10:49.185 --> 10:50.984
McGarrett.

10:50.986 --> 10:53.053
Yeah.

10:53.055 --> 10:55.155
No, no, no, I'll be right there.

10:58.394 --> 11:00.561
Hey, Chloe, you ever been
to a crime scene before?

11:00.563 --> 11:01.276
No.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.897
Okay, well, just don't
touch anything, all right?

11:02.898 --> 11:04.198
Please.

11:06.101 --> 11:08.535
Don't touch anything, please.
Remember,

11:08.537 --> 11:11.138
simple gestures
like wellbred social behavior

11:11.140 --> 11:15.843
breeds positive results which,
in turn, reduces stressors.

11:17.413 --> 11:19.379
I'm gonna keep that in mind.

11:19.381 --> 11:20.547
Thank you. You're welcome.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.049
Thank you, Chloe. Yes.

11:22.051 --> 11:23.450
Duke, what do you got?

11:23.452 --> 11:25.819
Victims' names are Todd Barris
and James Lowe.

11:25.821 --> 11:27.354
They're Realtors from Nevada.

11:27.356 --> 11:28.622
Both shot close range
while sitting

11:28.624 --> 11:30.190
in their rental car
with the engine off.

11:30.192 --> 11:31.925
Time of death
was around 5:00 a.m.

11:35.598 --> 11:37.264
You okay?

11:37.266 --> 11:39.566
I think I'm gonna be sick.

11:40.503 --> 11:42.536
Good job, buddy.
You've traumatized

11:42.538 --> 11:44.771
the, the stress lady.

11:44.773 --> 11:46.773
Any witnesses?

11:46.775 --> 11:48.275
Not so far.

11:50.279 --> 11:53.046
Danny, look at this.

11:54.483 --> 11:58.018
Well, this thing's been
recording for almost four hours.

11:58.020 --> 11:59.953
T.O.D. was 5:00 a.m., right?

11:59.955 --> 12:03.190
These guys might have
recorded their own murder.

12:05.528 --> 12:07.194
Wait, hold on.
We got rights here.

12:07.196 --> 12:08.595
That's a cop.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.998
No, look, Officer... Mathus?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.332
Mathus?
Yeah, my friend will be happy

12:12.334 --> 12:14.067
to cooperate after you tell us
what we did wrong.

12:14.069 --> 12:15.669
That's impossible.

12:15.671 --> 12:17.237
Wait a minute.
You know this guy?

12:17.239 --> 12:19.039
I did, but the thing is...

12:19.041 --> 12:21.561
Pat Mathus died three years ago.</font>

12:30.729 --> 12:34.047
Patrick Mathus
is most certainly dead.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.987
He died in 2014
from heart disease.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.872
Why would somebody
want to impersonate him?

12:38.873 --> 12:40.807
I mean, it's not gonna
help him get away

12:40.809 --> 12:41.975
with killing these guys.

12:41.977 --> 12:43.876
Yeah, I'm not sure,
but as it happens,

12:43.878 --> 12:46.446
the real Mathus wasn't
much better than our shooter.

12:46.448 --> 12:48.448
He was fired from HPD
seven years ago

12:48.450 --> 12:50.583
for excessive use of force.

12:50.585 --> 12:53.453
He was charged with assault
and served 18 months.

12:53.455 --> 12:55.321
Okay. What about family?

12:55.323 --> 12:57.557
Yeah, he left behind his ex,

12:57.559 --> 13:00.393
Claudia Nelson;
His son, Oliver Mathus,

13:00.395 --> 13:01.894
who's now in his 30s.

13:01.896 --> 13:03.029
His ex lives in Kapolei.

13:03.031 --> 13:05.331
I can send you her address
right now.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.467
All right, Tani, good work.
Thank you.

13:07.469 --> 13:10.270
Well, if we have a few minutes,
I'd like to talk about

13:10.272 --> 13:11.738
what happened
at the crime scene.

13:11.740 --> 13:13.106
Don't worry, all right?

13:13.108 --> 13:16.042
I mean, you had a perfectly
normal, human reaction

13:16.044 --> 13:18.411
to what is a horrible thing...
A gruesome death... okay?

13:18.413 --> 13:19.545
So don't think about it.

13:19.547 --> 13:22.529
Yeah, II did,
but you barely blinked,

13:22.530 --> 13:25.164
andand I'm a little
concerned about that.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.399
I think it might be a good idea

13:27.401 --> 13:29.535
to start talking about
how what you see

13:29.537 --> 13:32.337
at a crime scene makes you feel.

13:33.641 --> 13:36.275
Sorry, just to be clear,
you want me to stop down

13:36.277 --> 13:37.543
and talk about my feelings

13:37.545 --> 13:39.144
every time I see a dead body?

13:39.146 --> 13:40.445
Is that what you mean?

13:40.447 --> 13:41.139
Um...

13:41.163 --> 13:42.523
First of all, I'll never
get any work done.

13:42.524 --> 13:45.285
We see dead bodies every day.
Second of all, it's just...

13:45.286 --> 13:47.052
it's part of the job.
I mean, it's not...

13:47.054 --> 13:48.921
it's not nice, but it
goes with the territory.

13:48.923 --> 13:50.189
Right, Danny? I mean...

13:50.191 --> 13:52.925
Thethe point
is that stress management

13:52.927 --> 13:55.527
isn't some New Age nonsense.

13:55.529 --> 13:57.863
It's mostly checking in
with yourself,

13:57.865 --> 14:00.365
making small tweaks
to your daily life

14:00.367 --> 14:02.668
andand having outlets from work.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.286
So, um, can I ask you
some questions?

14:04.287 --> 14:05.079
Yeah.

14:05.103 --> 14:07.203
What do you like doing
in your spare time?

14:08.909 --> 14:10.909
I don't know. What do I do?

14:10.911 --> 14:12.945
II mean, I... I like to swim.

14:12.947 --> 14:15.080
Swim a lot. I like
to cook. Do I not?

14:15.082 --> 14:16.648
He's a good cook. Thank you.

14:16.650 --> 14:19.184
I got my, dad's
old Mercury in the garage.

14:19.186 --> 14:21.753
I like to tinker with that
when I get some time.

14:21.755 --> 14:23.488
Bunch of stuff.

14:23.490 --> 14:26.091
Okay, well, um, I mean,
how about relationships?

14:26.093 --> 14:28.293
Are you seeing anyone or...?

14:28.295 --> 14:30.629
I am. I am. I'm seeing
a nice young woman.

14:30.631 --> 14:32.497
Her name's Lynn.
She's, We've been

14:32.499 --> 14:34.633
seeing each other on and
off for a while now.

14:34.635 --> 14:36.535
Well, good, good.

14:36.537 --> 14:38.503
And I'm assuming you guys are...

14:38.505 --> 14:40.305
intimate?

14:41.976 --> 14:43.976
Intimate? You mean...

14:43.978 --> 14:46.545
Well, sex... it can be
a terrific stress reliever.

14:46.547 --> 14:49.014
Yeah. Right. You know, so, um...

14:49.016 --> 14:51.750
are you having regular sex?

14:53.420 --> 14:55.387
Are you having regular sex? I...

14:55.389 --> 14:57.022
It's a little... I just...

14:57.024 --> 14:58.790
I'm sorry, but it's...
a little personal.

14:58.792 --> 14:59.992
Is that... is this... No.

14:59.994 --> 15:00.993
Don't be embarrassed.

15:00.995 --> 15:02.127
Everybody does it.
Not embarrassed.

15:02.129 --> 15:04.830
Yeah, we're having regular sex.

15:04.832 --> 15:06.665
Good. Yeah, it is good.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.101
Um... how often?

15:09.103 --> 15:10.302
I don't know.

15:10.304 --> 15:12.738
You know, just aa...
a little ballpark...

15:12.740 --> 15:14.506
Ballpark. Okay.

15:14.508 --> 15:16.708
Five times a week, I guess.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.577
All right,
with the “five times a week.”

15:18.579 --> 15:20.312
Excuse me?
Okay, that's an inaccurate number.

15:20.314 --> 15:22.981
How would you know how many
times I'm having sex a week?

15:22.983 --> 15:25.350
Because Lynn speaks to Melissa,
and then Melissa shares with me.

15:25.352 --> 15:26.952
“Five times.”

15:26.954 --> 15:29.521
Why are you and your girlfriend
discussing our sex life?

15:29.523 --> 15:32.391
He has sex twice a week,
and three at the most,

15:32.393 --> 15:34.192
and that's if it's
someone's birthday or something.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.761
Don't write that down.
It's not true.

15:35.763 --> 15:37.029
Answer my question.

15:37.031 --> 15:38.830
Why is it a big deal? Who cares?

15:38.832 --> 15:40.832
Do me a favor.
Excuse us for a minute.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.834
Do me a favor, all right? Okay.

15:42.836 --> 15:44.603
Don't discuss intimate details

15:44.605 --> 15:46.104
of my relationship
with my girlfriend

15:46.106 --> 15:47.572
with your girlfriend.

15:47.574 --> 15:48.707
Is that fair enough?

15:48.709 --> 15:50.309
Okay. Thank you.

15:51.078 --> 15:53.145
Moving on. Next question.

15:57.751 --> 15:59.318
Claudia Nelson, FiveO.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.385
Anybody home?

16:02.990 --> 16:04.990
Stay right behind me.

16:14.201 --> 16:15.867
Stay behind Danny,
all right? Danny?

16:38.525 --> 16:40.025
Hello?

16:47.067 --> 16:49.267
Yo.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.769
Claudia Nelson's dead.

16:50.771 --> 16:53.705
I, found a body
in the bed upstairs.

16:53.707 --> 16:54.940
Noelani's gonna do her thing,

16:54.942 --> 16:57.309
but it looks to me
like natural causes.

16:57.311 --> 16:58.877
I'ml'm fine, by the way.

16:58.879 --> 17:01.346
Good. Okay, um, I got

17:01.348 --> 17:02.647
a personal pharmacy here.

17:02.649 --> 17:06.984
Psych meds, antipsych meds,
mood stabilizers.

17:06.987 --> 17:08.619
All prescribed to Oliver Mathus,

17:08.622 --> 17:12.324
who I think lives here,
Claudia's son.

17:12.326 --> 17:13.825
And there is three days

17:13.827 --> 17:16.194
of his pillbox
that are still full of pills.

17:16.195 --> 17:17.695
Last three days.

17:17.698 --> 17:19.531
Maybe Oliver is the guy
we're looking for.

17:19.532 --> 17:22.134
He finds out
that his mom's dead,

17:22.136 --> 17:25.503
and he goes off his meds, um...

17:25.506 --> 17:27.906
goes a little crazy,
I don't know,

17:27.907 --> 17:31.076
finds one of his old man's
old uniforms,

17:31.078 --> 17:33.345
gets a gun,
goes and plays dressup.

17:33.347 --> 17:35.747
But why wouldn't he just
tell someone his mom died?

17:37.651 --> 17:39.117
I'm sorry. Am I allowed
to ask questions or...?

17:39.119 --> 17:40.485
Sure.

17:40.487 --> 17:42.487
It's a good question.

18:01.141 --> 18:04.242
Hey. Who are you?

18:04.244 --> 18:06.812
What are you doing in my house?

18:07.948 --> 18:10.282
Are you deaf?
Who the hell are you?

18:10.284 --> 18:12.551
Ollie.

18:14.855 --> 18:16.588
What are you, a cop?

18:16.590 --> 18:19.558
Okay, look, look, I don't know
what's up with you,

18:19.560 --> 18:21.960
but either you leave now
or I'm calling 911.

18:21.962 --> 18:26.932
But my mommy said
I could watch TV.

18:26.934 --> 18:29.201
All right, I'm done.</font>

18:30.404 --> 18:33.839
Yeah, I'm calling to,
report a home invasion.

18:33.841 --> 18:35.974
No, no, no, he's still here.

18:35.976 --> 18:38.643
He, he looks like a cop,

18:38.645 --> 18:40.045
only tripping on something.

18:40.047 --> 18:41.546
No.

18:41.548 --> 18:44.816
Look, you gotta
send somebody right now.

18:50.591 --> 18:52.157
You shouldn't have done that.

18:53.961 --> 18:56.695
You should've left
that kid alone.

19:06.056 --> 19:09.725
II don't remember much
after he attacked me.

19:09.727 --> 19:13.695
I mean, right before that,
there was this... this change.

19:13.697 --> 19:15.697
I mean, one second he said

19:15.699 --> 19:19.234
his name was Ollie,
and then it was like...

19:19.236 --> 19:21.103
it was like a
switch got flipped.

19:22.506 --> 19:24.740
He became a different person.

19:27.611 --> 19:29.278
A different person.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.079
Yeah.

19:32.950 --> 19:35.017
Well, based on what
you're telling me,

19:35.019 --> 19:38.020
it sounds like your
suspect is D.I.D.

19:38.022 --> 19:39.721
Dissociative identity disorder.

19:39.723 --> 19:40.989
D.I.D... isn't that

19:40.991 --> 19:43.525
the multiplepersonality
condition that Dr. Gray faked

19:43.527 --> 19:45.093
when she gave herself up?

19:45.095 --> 19:46.862
Yeah.

19:48.032 --> 19:50.766
Is D.I.D. something
Oliver was born with?

19:50.768 --> 19:55.904
Well, yeah, I mean, you can be
genetically predisposed, but...

19:55.906 --> 19:57.773
it's usually an extreme trauma

19:57.775 --> 20:00.075
that's caused the
mind to fracture.

20:00.077 --> 20:03.045
People with D.I.D., they have
their primary identity,

20:03.047 --> 20:06.315
which usually goes
by their given name, and...

20:06.317 --> 20:08.483
they're normally pretty passive.

20:08.485 --> 20:10.385
Then the other
identities... alters...

20:10.387 --> 20:12.387
Which have
different personalities,

20:12.389 --> 20:14.489
mannerisms, speech patterns.

20:14.491 --> 20:17.759
So I think
that Oliver is the primary.

20:17.761 --> 20:19.461
So there'sthere's Ollie,
the little boy...

20:19.463 --> 20:20.629
And then whichever

20:20.631 --> 20:23.799
other identity
attacked Mr. Mitchell.

20:23.801 --> 20:26.301
I think that alter
was the protector.

20:26.303 --> 20:27.502
Protector?

20:27.504 --> 20:29.504
Yeah, protectors
are usually violent.

20:29.506 --> 20:32.708
Shows up when another identity
is feeling threatened.

20:32.710 --> 20:37.079
How long will this
protector alter stay in control?

20:37.081 --> 20:39.047
It could be hours,

20:39.049 --> 20:42.050
days... I... I'd
have to know more.

20:43.854 --> 20:45.487
All right, come on.

20:45.489 --> 20:47.389
So the house that
Oliver broke into...

20:47.391 --> 20:50.058
Turns out the property records
are saying that he lived there

20:50.060 --> 20:52.060
with his family
before his parents split.

20:52.062 --> 20:54.696
All right, well,
that makes sense. What else?

20:54.698 --> 20:57.633
The car that Patrick Mathus
drove before he passed away,

20:57.635 --> 21:00.202
it was an unmarked HPD vehicle.

21:00.204 --> 21:01.637
The registration lapsed

21:01.639 --> 21:02.804
after he passed.

21:02.806 --> 21:05.507
The title was
transferred to Claudia.

21:05.509 --> 21:07.709
Okay, so maybe that was the car
that Oliver used

21:07.711 --> 21:09.678
to pull over
his first two victims.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.280
- Yeah, HPD's looking for it now.
Good.

21:12.282 --> 21:14.082
- That it?
Not quite.

21:14.084 --> 21:15.584
And this one's
kind of a curveball.

21:15.586 --> 21:16.885
Ballistics came back
on the bullets

21:16.887 --> 21:18.053
that killed our two vics,

21:18.055 --> 21:19.821
and the slugs were a match to

21:19.823 --> 21:23.225
an unsolved organized crime hit
from 30 years ago.

21:23.227 --> 21:25.193
Oliver wasn't even born yet,

21:25.195 --> 21:26.395
so we're thinking

21:26.397 --> 21:27.896
this must be dad.

21:27.898 --> 21:29.998
Okay, well, do we
know if Patrick

21:30.000 --> 21:32.734
was connected to any
of the vics in that case?

21:32.736 --> 21:34.703
- No, but we're working on it.
Okay.

21:34.705 --> 21:36.038
What's going on in there?

21:36.040 --> 21:38.040
Chloe asked Junior to stop by.

21:38.042 --> 21:39.341
Think she wanted
an insider's perspective

21:39.343 --> 21:40.509
on McGarrett's home life.

21:41.812 --> 21:43.245
You've been very helpful.

21:43.247 --> 21:45.547
Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.

21:47.017 --> 21:48.717
What's up, buddy?

21:48.719 --> 21:51.820
Nice kid.

21:51.822 --> 21:54.056
Very nice kid. Actually,

21:54.058 --> 21:55.624
I'm glad you're here.

21:55.626 --> 21:57.859
I was wondering...
Do you think Commander McGarrett

21:57.861 --> 22:00.662
would, um, consider maybe
a treadmill desk?

22:00.664 --> 22:02.264
Or aa snake plant?

22:02.266 --> 22:03.732
What's a snake plant?

22:03.734 --> 22:05.267
It's an evergreen perennial.

22:05.269 --> 22:07.836
Great for small spaces,
and plants can be

22:07.838 --> 22:09.404
an incredible mood booster.

22:09.406 --> 22:11.740
A few adjustments
to one's work space,

22:11.742 --> 22:14.076
it can do wonders
for stress relief.

22:14.078 --> 22:16.712
Okay, um... let me explain
something to you.

22:16.714 --> 22:19.681
Um, youyou shouldn't,
be in here.

22:19.683 --> 22:21.116
He should not know that you're

22:21.118 --> 22:23.018
snooping around
in his office at all.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.087
And as far as, him making

22:25.089 --> 22:27.589
any changes, to his work space,

22:27.591 --> 22:29.958
that'sthat's just...
it's just not gonna happen.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.460
Ever?

22:31.462 --> 22:33.028
Never ever. Yeah.

22:33.030 --> 22:34.196
That's out.

22:34.198 --> 22:35.330
All right, I told you

22:35.332 --> 22:36.798
he's very stubborn
and very pigheaded.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.400
He's like a child.

22:38.402 --> 22:40.969
So, getting him
to change anything

22:40.971 --> 22:43.538
is gonna be difficult,
let alone where he works, so...

22:43.540 --> 22:46.408
Okay, um...

22:46.410 --> 22:47.776
How about you?

22:47.778 --> 22:50.178
How about me what? I just...

22:50.180 --> 22:52.981
From what I've seen,
I can't help but notice

22:52.983 --> 22:56.885
that some of your behavior, um,
can be causing.

22:56.887 --> 23:00.122
Commander McGarrett
some undue stress.

23:00.124 --> 23:01.423
Why? Whatwhat am I doing?

23:01.425 --> 23:03.558
You two got in
a pretty heated argument

23:03.560 --> 23:05.360
in the car this morning.

23:05.362 --> 23:07.963
How often does that happen?

23:07.965 --> 23:10.065
Once or twice a month?

23:10.067 --> 23:11.833
Sure. Something like that.

23:11.835 --> 23:14.803
And I imagine that he gets

23:14.805 --> 23:16.671
pretty worked up?

23:16.673 --> 23:18.874
Yeah.

23:18.876 --> 23:20.942
Yeah, he gets
worked up sometimes.

23:20.944 --> 23:22.577
All the time. Okay.

23:22.579 --> 23:24.913
So, for... for the time being,

23:24.915 --> 23:27.582
if you could keep
your conversations

23:27.584 --> 23:29.518
centered with your partner
around work

23:29.520 --> 23:33.455
andand be civil
and as positive as you can.

23:33.457 --> 23:35.557
Well, thatthat's gonna
be very difficult,

23:35.559 --> 23:37.025
for a number of reasons.

23:37.027 --> 23:38.860
One being that we
have a restaurant.

23:38.862 --> 23:41.429
Whatwhat... what restaurant?

23:41.431 --> 23:44.599
Yeah, Steve and I are
opening a restaurant together.

23:46.670 --> 23:48.436
What is that?

23:48.438 --> 23:52.374
It's just, you know,
um, starting a business...

23:52.376 --> 23:55.577
Especially one with a 60% to 80%
failure rate... can...

23:55.579 --> 23:57.345
can be very stressful.

23:57.347 --> 23:58.580
Let me ask you something.

23:58.582 --> 23:59.848
Why do people feel the need

23:59.850 --> 24:01.817
to point out to me
that most restaurants fail?

24:01.819 --> 24:03.521
I don't need to know that.
I don't need that...

24:03.522 --> 24:05.956
I'm sorry, I just...
So I gotta change?

24:05.958 --> 24:08.425
Is that what you're getting at?

24:08.427 --> 24:12.062
If you could be
a little less negative,

24:12.064 --> 24:15.047
a little more agreeable
in your dealings with Steve,

24:15.048 --> 24:17.675
I think... I think
that would really help.

24:17.676 --> 24:20.677
Just for the record,
I'm always the one changing.

24:20.678 --> 24:22.745
It is always me
compromising for him.

24:22.747 --> 24:24.846
It's very typical.
It's never him doing anything.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.003
Yeah, I'm sure that's
very frustrating.

24:28.004 --> 24:30.638
It is... it is...
it is beyond frustrating.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.375
But you're gonna be happy
to try, right?

24:34.377 --> 24:35.576
Listen, I... it'll make me

24:35.578 --> 24:37.345
want to kill myself,
but I'll give it a shot.

24:37.347 --> 24:40.481
Give what a shot?</font>

24:41.884 --> 24:43.884
Tai Chi.

24:43.886 --> 24:48.055
Chloe, thinks that you
should get a...

24:48.057 --> 24:50.124
a StairMaster and a...

24:50.126 --> 24:51.425
a frog plant.

24:51.427 --> 24:52.927
No, a treadmill desk

24:52.929 --> 24:54.695
and a snake plant. Snake plant.

24:54.697 --> 24:55.730
Right.

24:55.732 --> 24:57.598
I like my office the way it is.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.066
This is Alicia Brown,
by the way.

24:59.068 --> 25:00.835
Alicia's consulting with us

25:00.837 --> 25:02.536
- on this case now.
Nice to meet you.

25:02.538 --> 25:03.504
Chloe Gordon.

25:03.506 --> 25:05.039
Consulting on Steve.</font>

25:05.041 --> 25:06.807
Yeah, I heard.
Good luck with that.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.843
We got information on Oliver.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.279
You should...

25:12.281 --> 25:14.348
I'll... yeah, just...

25:14.350 --> 25:16.350
So, how is everyone?

25:16.352 --> 25:18.085
You know.

25:18.087 --> 25:20.655
Well, same old drama.

25:20.657 --> 25:22.289
T.J.'s mad at Ollie

25:22.291 --> 25:23.624
'cause Ollie's been out a lot.

25:23.626 --> 25:26.027
I tell him, you know,
you gotta cut him some slack.

25:26.029 --> 25:27.461
He's just a little kid.

25:27.463 --> 25:29.063
But he won't listen.

25:29.065 --> 25:32.299
And Jennifer's in
a little catfight with Mom.

25:32.301 --> 25:35.369
And no one wants to ask me
how my day's going.

25:36.873 --> 25:38.472
Meet Oliver Mathus.

25:38.474 --> 25:39.974
According to his therapist,

25:39.976 --> 25:42.910
he has seven
distinct identities.

25:42.912 --> 25:45.079
Oliver, who is the primary,
which means he's the one

25:45.081 --> 25:47.815
that's most out... or in control.

25:47.817 --> 25:49.383
And the six other
identities are:

25:49.385 --> 25:51.952
Jennifer, a 50yearold
biology teacher;

25:51.954 --> 25:54.355
T.J., a teenager;

25:54.357 --> 25:57.825
Ollie, who is Oliver
when he was five year old;

25:57.827 --> 26:00.561
Corey, student; Lyla, artist;

26:00.563 --> 26:02.863
And the one who I think
is responsible

26:02.865 --> 26:05.566
for today's violence is Patrick,

26:05.568 --> 26:07.268
who, for all intents
and purposes,

26:07.270 --> 26:09.403
is Oliver's father.

26:09.405 --> 26:11.839
So, when he's Patrick,

26:11.841 --> 26:13.741
does he genuinely believe
that he's a cop?

26:13.743 --> 26:15.543
Correct.

26:15.545 --> 26:17.078
Got any tape on that one?

26:17.080 --> 26:19.714
No. According to
Dr. Caldwell's notes,

26:19.716 --> 26:21.415
Patrick's been
dormant for years,

26:21.417 --> 26:23.718
thanks to the medication and
close supervision of his mother.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.520
I think that the extreme trauma

26:26.522 --> 26:28.789
of his mother's death is what
brought Patrick back out.

26:28.791 --> 26:31.092
That was obviously
gonna happen eventually.

26:31.094 --> 26:32.426
The shrink knew
he was dangerous.

26:32.428 --> 26:34.061
Whywhy... why didn't he
have him committed?

26:34.063 --> 26:36.397
Because Oliver's not responsible
for what his alters do

26:36.399 --> 26:37.698
when they're in control.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.933
So, if you lock up Oliver

26:38.935 --> 26:42.069
to ensure that Patrick's
not a threat,

26:42.071 --> 26:43.604
you're locking up

26:43.606 --> 26:45.172
all his other identities, too.

26:45.174 --> 26:47.241
Yeah.</font>

26:50.279 --> 26:51.412
No, patch him through.

26:51.414 --> 26:53.214
- Patch him through.
What's up?

26:53.216 --> 26:55.182
Ollie just called HPD.

26:55.184 --> 26:56.450
Alicia, I need you
to talk to him.

26:56.452 --> 26:58.352
Jerry, run a trace.

26:58.354 --> 26:59.854
Got a lock?

26:59.856 --> 27:01.822
Are you ready? Yeah.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.160
Hello?

27:07.497 --> 27:09.997
Please, I...

27:09.999 --> 27:12.566
I need some help.

27:13.402 --> 27:15.603
Mommy.

27:15.605 --> 27:18.405
Ollie, my name's Alicia.

27:18.407 --> 27:21.108
I work with the police,
and I'm gonna help you, okay?

27:21.110 --> 27:23.310
I want my mommy.

27:23.312 --> 27:25.112
I want to go home.

27:25.114 --> 27:26.947
I understand.
Do you know where you are?

27:26.949 --> 27:31.118
I think my daddy
did something bad.

27:34.090 --> 27:35.289
I'm scared.

27:35.291 --> 27:37.291
Okay. It's okay.

27:37.293 --> 27:40.828
I'm gonna stay on the phone
with you until help gets there.

27:40.830 --> 27:42.930
Are you hurt?

27:45.401 --> 27:46.734
Ollie?

27:46.736 --> 27:50.337
He wants me to hang up now.

27:51.474 --> 27:53.574
He says...

27:53.576 --> 27:57.178
I'm not allowed
to talk to you anymore.

27:57.180 --> 27:58.946
Who?

28:01.184 --> 28:02.616
Ollie?

28:02.618 --> 28:05.519
Please, I need some help.

28:06.622 --> 28:08.923
Got him. He's at the corner
of Pohukaina and Cooke.

28:10.026 --> 28:12.626
Chloe, listen, youyou
didn't have to come along.

28:12.628 --> 28:15.129
You understand that, right?
No, no.

28:15.131 --> 28:16.263
Youyou people hired me

28:16.265 --> 28:18.299
to make an assessment,
and I'm going...

28:19.302 --> 28:20.734
DDo you have to drive this fast?

28:20.736 --> 28:22.002
We always do it like this,

28:22.004 --> 28:24.171
and you're gonna be
okay... I promise.

28:33.749 --> 28:35.349
What's wrong with you?

28:35.351 --> 28:37.084
Me? Yeah, you.

28:37.086 --> 28:38.619
I didn't...
I didn't say anything.

28:38.621 --> 28:40.421
I know you didn't. That's why
I'm asking what's wrong.

28:40.423 --> 28:42.790
Usually by now, you've said
something hilarious like:

28:42.792 --> 28:45.492
“Hey, Steve, it's not the
DeLorean time machine.

28:45.494 --> 28:47.928
You know, we don't have
to get it up to 88”...

28:47.930 --> 28:49.163
That's actually funny.

28:49.165 --> 28:51.532
"Or maybe, : “Hey, can
you turn up the radio”"

28:51.534 --> 28:53.801
I say, “Why?” You say,
“'Cause I'm pretty sure

28:53.803 --> 28:56.570
I just heard the GPS lady
say she wants to get out”.

28:58.174 --> 29:00.341
I think you're doing a fine job.

29:00.343 --> 29:02.309
In fact, maybe you want
to give Grace

29:02.311 --> 29:04.612
a driving lesson this weekend
or something like that.

29:04.614 --> 29:07.014
My God.

29:07.016 --> 29:09.049
You told him he's part of
the problem, didn't you?

29:09.051 --> 29:11.352
She did, didn't she?
She said to you

29:11.354 --> 29:15.723
that your constant
complaining and criticisms

29:15.725 --> 29:17.391
are contributing to my stress.

29:17.393 --> 29:19.493
She did. You know what, Chloe?

29:19.495 --> 29:20.728
I think you're right.
I think I do

29:20.730 --> 29:22.796
have a stress problem,
and you know where it is?

29:22.798 --> 29:24.632
Right here, riding shotgun
with me every day.

29:24.634 --> 29:26.500
Okay, keep your eyes
on the road, please.

29:26.502 --> 29:27.735
Thank you.</font>

29:27.737 --> 29:28.969
Jerry, what's up?

29:28.971 --> 29:30.404
HPD got to the
intersection ahead of you.

29:30.406 --> 29:31.906
There's a body at the
scene, but Oliver's

29:31.908 --> 29:34.141
- on the move again.
All right, where's he going?

29:34.143 --> 29:36.110
It looks like...

29:36.112 --> 29:37.745
he's at HPD headquarters.
Copy that.

29:37.747 --> 29:38.779
Do me a favor. Call Duke.

29:38.781 --> 29:40.648
Tell him
what we know about Oliver.

29:40.650 --> 29:42.182
Hang on.

29:42.184 --> 29:44.318
Whoa!</font>

30:04.106 --> 30:05.806
This is Officer Mathus.

30:05.808 --> 30:07.441
How can I help you?

30:22.237 --> 30:23.804
Hey.

30:23.806 --> 30:25.906
How are you?

30:25.908 --> 30:27.908
Good.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.977
What, are you new here?

30:30.979 --> 30:32.312
Duke Lukela.

30:32.314 --> 30:34.581
Um, you're Mathus, right?

30:34.583 --> 30:35.882
Yeah. Pat Mathus.

30:35.884 --> 30:38.752
How is it out there today?

30:41.590 --> 30:43.156
Slow.

30:43.158 --> 30:45.125
Nothing but traffic stops.

30:45.127 --> 30:46.860
Good. Listen, um,

30:46.862 --> 30:48.128
Captain Tanaka...

30:48.130 --> 30:50.764
said he wanted to see you
in his office.

30:56.305 --> 30:58.872
Of course he does.</font>

31:05.113 --> 31:07.647
Hey! Open the damn door!

31:12.855 --> 31:14.387
Chloe, this officer's gonna

31:14.389 --> 31:15.856
take you someplace
safe, all right?

31:15.858 --> 31:16.990
You're gonna stay with him.

31:16.992 --> 31:19.459
Duke, where is he? This way.

31:29.771 --> 31:31.371
Duke.

31:31.373 --> 31:32.372
Lock the building down.

31:32.374 --> 31:33.974
Get everybody out.

31:33.976 --> 31:35.642
What are the odds he
turned himself into

31:35.644 --> 31:37.844
the 50yearold biology teacher?

31:38.714 --> 31:39.846
But if you're asking me,

31:39.848 --> 31:42.482
the most interesting study
is that when animals

31:42.484 --> 31:44.017
are bred for cooperation,

31:44.019 --> 31:45.752
they become
more like their infants.

31:45.754 --> 31:47.187
It's true, there's a...

31:53.295 --> 31:54.995
Clear.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.431
She thinks I'm a...

31:58.433 --> 32:00.300
loser.

32:02.504 --> 32:06.072
Ollie, tell me about Mommy.

32:06.074 --> 32:08.508
I love Mommy.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.377
You do?

32:11.546 --> 32:13.313
As big as the sky.

32:13.315 --> 32:15.882
Can you tell me about her?

32:15.884 --> 32:19.686
She wears soft blue dresses.

32:31.333 --> 32:36.436
She makes me tuna sandwiches
with extra mayo and...

32:36.438 --> 32:39.172
bananas.

32:40.042 --> 32:43.510
She cuts the bananas
the long way.

32:51.820 --> 32:53.186
Hi. Noelani.

32:53.188 --> 32:54.621
It's Alicia Brown.

32:54.623 --> 32:56.990
Um...

32:56.992 --> 32:59.592
II need a favor.

33:08.103 --> 33:10.403
Patrick Mathus, FiveO! Drop it!

33:12.908 --> 33:14.874
We found him! West hallway!

33:14.876 --> 33:16.076
Heading north.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.511
He could be headed
to the police garage. Moving.

33:21.516 --> 33:22.983
Hey!

33:22.985 --> 33:26.486
Jerry! Jerry, I need
a trace on a cruiser.

33:26.488 --> 33:28.555
It's car 636.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.120
Patrick, freeze! Freeze!

34:00.122 --> 34:01.121
Right there. Don't move.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.490
Drop the weapon. Put it down.

34:03.492 --> 34:04.657
Put the weapon down.

34:06.428 --> 34:08.360
Back off!

34:11.466 --> 34:13.233
Back off.

34:16.204 --> 34:17.971
Or I'll kill 'em.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.873
Jennifer.

34:19.875 --> 34:21.940
Oliver.

34:21.943 --> 34:24.277
The little kid.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.181
Back off!

34:29.051 --> 34:31.217
Or I'll kill 'em all.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.554
Easy. Just easy, all right?

34:34.556 --> 34:36.922
I know you're upset.
I want to help you.

34:36.925 --> 34:39.525
But you gotta tell me
what you need, Patrick.

34:39.527 --> 34:43.129
No. No, don't do that.
Don't negotiate me.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.532
Okay.

34:45.534 --> 34:47.634
All right. Okay.

34:47.636 --> 34:49.302
But you know the drill,
Officer, right?

34:49.304 --> 34:51.103
I'm just... I just gotta...
I gotta do what I gotta do.

34:51.106 --> 34:54.440
And that's keep all these
people safe. You know that.

34:54.443 --> 34:57.377
And they're not gonna be safe
until you put that gun down.

34:57.379 --> 34:59.045
No, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

34:59.047 --> 35:01.915
I'm going in here,
and you're gonna leave me alone.

35:03.118 --> 35:05.718
Lou, establish a perimeter.
He doesn't leave that house.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.720
Sniper teams, go to set point.

35:22.661 --> 35:24.627
Where is she?

35:24.629 --> 35:26.763
Where is my wife?

35:34.406 --> 35:35.939
Where is she?!

35:35.941 --> 35:37.407
Where is my wife?

35:37.409 --> 35:39.442
You gonna tell him, or should I?

35:39.444 --> 35:42.111
Officer Mathus, we can talk
about Claudia in a minute,

35:42.113 --> 35:44.314
but first...
listen, I just need you

35:44.316 --> 35:47.050
to put the gun down and
come outside. You understand?

35:47.052 --> 35:49.852
At least he's in there alone.</font>

35:51.189 --> 35:52.655
What are you doing?

35:52.657 --> 35:54.524
I heard what was happening
on the way over.

35:54.526 --> 35:56.359
- What is that?
- It's our one shot

35:56.361 --> 35:59.128
at ending this,
but I gotta go in alone.

35:59.130 --> 36:00.563
Forget about it.

36:00.565 --> 36:02.553
I think I know how
to get through to him.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.100
I don't care.

36:03.101 --> 36:05.301
All right, I'm not putting you
at risk, Alicia. No.

36:05.303 --> 36:07.904
We both know that,
despite appearances,

36:07.906 --> 36:10.139
there's a child in there.

36:10.141 --> 36:11.574
Please.

36:11.576 --> 36:13.710
Come on, let me go in
and get him.

36:15.847 --> 36:17.580
I got snipers in position.

36:17.582 --> 36:19.515
All right, this thing
even starts to go south,

36:19.517 --> 36:20.850
they get the green light.

36:20.852 --> 36:22.318
Okay.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.400
Who are you?

36:37.402 --> 36:38.968
I'm Dr. Alicia Brown.

36:38.970 --> 36:40.837
I'm here to help you.

36:43.041 --> 36:45.074
Where's Claudia?
I want to see my wife.

36:45.076 --> 36:47.810
We're trying to find her.

36:51.449 --> 36:53.883
You've had a...

36:53.885 --> 36:55.685
a long day,

36:55.687 --> 37:00.023
and I was thinking that
you must be very hungry.

37:00.025 --> 37:02.425
I mean, what a...

37:02.427 --> 37:05.094
hard day you've had,
doing all those things

37:05.096 --> 37:08.564
that I know you didn't want to.

37:08.566 --> 37:12.769
But, you really...
you had no choice.

37:12.771 --> 37:16.306
You must just feel so...
so trapped.

37:16.308 --> 37:18.074
And scared.

37:18.076 --> 37:22.478
You must just want things to go
back to the way they were.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.614
Right? Milk?

37:24.616 --> 37:26.949
There we go.

37:27.819 --> 37:30.219
Some nice, cold milk.

37:30.221 --> 37:33.389
And a tuna sandwich.

37:33.391 --> 37:36.092
With extra mayo. Here we go.

37:36.094 --> 37:39.062
And the bananas,
I slice longways,

37:39.064 --> 37:40.963
which is just how you like it.

37:40.965 --> 37:42.799
Isn't that right?

37:44.669 --> 37:46.769
Listen, why don't you...

37:46.771 --> 37:50.373
just come and make yourself
comfortable and...

37:50.375 --> 37:51.908
That's her dress.

37:51.910 --> 37:53.343
That's my wife's dress.

37:53.345 --> 37:54.677
Steve?

37:54.679 --> 37:56.713
Snipers, you in position?

37:56.715 --> 37:58.014
Affirmative.

37:58.016 --> 37:59.082
Yes, sir.

37:59.084 --> 38:00.883
On my command.

38:01.953 --> 38:03.786
Ollie?

38:03.788 --> 38:05.988
Ollie...

38:05.990 --> 38:08.558
don't be scared.

38:09.694 --> 38:11.627
Mommy loves you.

38:11.629 --> 38:13.096
Always. Forever.

38:13.098 --> 38:14.964
As big as the sky.

38:14.966 --> 38:17.433
As big as the sky.

38:19.003 --> 38:21.237
As big as the sky.

38:25.009 --> 38:26.442
Mommy.

38:28.313 --> 38:29.645
Mommy.

38:29.647 --> 38:31.647
I'm sorry.

38:33.785 --> 38:35.885
It's okay.

38:38.123 --> 38:39.655
It's okay, Ollie.

38:39.657 --> 38:41.557
It's okay.

39:01.813 --> 39:04.714
Do all these people
have to be here for this?

39:04.716 --> 39:05.982
Hell yeah.

39:05.984 --> 39:08.618
See, a professional trying
to tell McGarrett what to do?

39:08.620 --> 39:11.287
Hell, that's dinner and a show.
I should've brought my wife.

39:13.458 --> 39:14.557
You know what?

39:14.559 --> 39:15.892
Everyone,
if you're gonna be here,

39:15.894 --> 39:17.226
you gotta zip it, please.

39:17.228 --> 39:19.295
Let's hear what,
Chloe has to say.

39:19.297 --> 39:21.063
Your evaluation, please.

39:21.065 --> 39:24.133
Well, Commander,
what I want to tell you to do

39:24.135 --> 39:26.436
is quit your job
and take up gardening.

39:26.438 --> 39:29.105
But I just spent
all day with you,

39:29.107 --> 39:31.941
and I don't see that happening.

39:31.943 --> 39:34.310
That being said, I think there
are a few ways you can,

39:34.312 --> 39:35.912
manage your stress better.

39:35.914 --> 39:38.281
Yeah, um, for starters,
II looked

39:38.283 --> 39:40.850
at the calendar
in your work computer.

39:40.852 --> 39:43.419
Maybe you want
to consider using it

39:43.421 --> 39:45.188
or create a todo list.

39:45.190 --> 39:48.691
Staying organized, it's...
it's crucial to avoiding stress.

39:48.693 --> 39:50.393
Thank you.

39:51.729 --> 39:52.762
Excuse me.

39:52.764 --> 39:54.931
What are you doing,
taking notes?

39:54.933 --> 39:56.732
Yes, sir.

39:56.734 --> 39:58.534
Thank you.

39:58.536 --> 40:00.002
What in the hell is that?

40:00.004 --> 40:02.872
I didn't know you had
anything green on that truck.

40:02.874 --> 40:04.807
What is it, a secret
menu item or something?

40:04.809 --> 40:07.310
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

40:07.312 --> 40:10.379
You need to learn how
to ask the right questions, OG.

40:11.816 --> 40:13.883
Can I have a chili dog?

40:13.885 --> 40:15.551
- No.
Anyway, there are,

40:15.553 --> 40:17.053
a few other things.

40:17.055 --> 40:19.322
You'll have my full
written report tomorrow.

40:19.324 --> 40:22.692
Um, I'm going to add
a personalized daily plan.

40:22.694 --> 40:25.361
It will include
stressreducing techniques,

40:25.363 --> 40:28.664
holistic modalities,
dietary guidelines.

40:28.666 --> 40:30.733
Um, case in point,
youyou might want

40:30.735 --> 40:32.969
to just cut back on the shrimp.

40:32.971 --> 40:35.371
I'm gonna have to
factcheck you there, sistah.

40:35.373 --> 40:38.474
Studies show
that a threeweek shrimp diet

40:38.476 --> 40:40.877
has an overall positive effect

40:40.879 --> 40:43.579
on cholesterol,
because it raises HDL...

40:43.581 --> 40:46.883
Or good cholesterol...
Levels by 13%.

40:49.888 --> 40:52.221
Okay, yeah, sure.

40:52.223 --> 40:53.890
But then you, sprinkle it

40:53.892 --> 40:57.293
with salt, douse it in butter
and deepfry it, so...

40:58.863 --> 41:01.163
Out. You're banned for life.

41:01.165 --> 41:03.332
- All right, chill there, big fella.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

41:03.334 --> 41:04.834
He's not gonna listen
to anything she says.

41:04.836 --> 41:06.235
Don't listen to him.

41:06.237 --> 41:08.671
Listen, I'm gonna get
a round of drinks for everybody.

41:08.673 --> 41:10.840
Danny, give me a hand, please.

41:12.410 --> 41:15.811
All right, please
tell me I'm not alone

41:15.813 --> 41:18.447
inin... in how I
feel about this.

41:18.449 --> 41:20.550
This whole thing
is just ridiculous.

41:20.552 --> 41:22.285
Are you kidding me? Diet plans?

41:22.287 --> 41:23.653
A treadmill desk?

41:23.655 --> 41:27.623
The selfregulating destress
modulator whatever she said.

41:27.625 --> 41:29.926
You having to selfcensor?
Please.

41:29.928 --> 41:31.994
So you're not gonna take
any of her advice?

41:31.996 --> 41:34.297
No, 'cause it's silly.

41:34.299 --> 41:35.798
That's good.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.734
It's a waste of my money,
waste of her time.

41:38.736 --> 41:40.603
Let me ask you a question.

41:40.605 --> 41:42.371
What's with micromanaging
my health all of a sudden?

41:42.373 --> 41:43.940
What's going on?

41:44.909 --> 41:46.676
Okay, because I'm scared

41:46.678 --> 41:48.811
that you're not
taking this seriously.

41:48.813 --> 41:49.602
Why would you say that?

41:49.626 --> 41:50.981
When you told me that you
had radiation poisoning,

41:50.982 --> 41:52.148
it was... you were very casual.

41:52.150 --> 41:53.583
It was like, you were telling me

41:53.585 --> 41:55.117
you had, eczema
or something like that.

41:55.119 --> 41:56.686
And it was the same thing
with the liver.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.354
I give you my liver,
you don't follow any

41:58.356 --> 41:59.555
of the postop instructions.

41:59.557 --> 42:01.123
You don't take nothing
seriously. That's why.

42:01.125 --> 42:02.391
You're exaggerating, all right?

42:02.393 --> 42:04.961
You're overexaggerating.
I'm not overexaggerating.

42:04.963 --> 42:06.362
I am genuinely scared
for your health.

42:06.364 --> 42:08.230
Okay? I lay up at night,
I'm sick about it.

42:08.232 --> 42:10.433
I can't sleep. I almost called
that therapist to try to get

42:10.435 --> 42:12.368
another session.
Why wouldn't you say something to me?

42:12.370 --> 42:13.836
What am I gonna say to you?

42:13.838 --> 42:15.237
Thatthat I'm stressed
about the fact

42:15.239 --> 42:16.939
that you are not taking
this thing seriously

42:16.941 --> 42:18.107
about your own health?

42:18.109 --> 42:20.209
I mean, II'm not
gonna put that on you.

42:20.211 --> 42:23.746
It's my own thing.
WhWhat am I gonna say to you?

42:25.483 --> 42:28.150
I'm scared, too, man.

42:28.152 --> 42:31.153
I know I don't... II don't
show it, but deep down,

42:31.155 --> 42:32.588
I'm scared.

42:32.590 --> 42:34.690
You think I don't want
to live a long life?

42:34.692 --> 42:36.826
You think I don't want to maybe
get married someday?

42:36.828 --> 42:38.094
Have my own kids?

42:38.096 --> 42:39.762
I love your kids.
All right, Charlie,

42:39.764 --> 42:41.530
Gracie, I want to
watch them grow up.

42:41.532 --> 42:43.332
I want to see Joanie grow up.

42:43.334 --> 42:44.800
I'll tell you what
I'm not gonna do.

42:44.802 --> 42:46.235
I'm not gonna obsess
over something

42:46.237 --> 42:48.337
that might happen, and I can't
let you do that, either.

42:48.339 --> 42:49.338
I'm serious about this.

42:49.340 --> 42:51.140
And there's one other thing.

42:51.142 --> 42:53.509
Please, whatever she said
to you, don'tdon't do that.

42:53.511 --> 42:56.379
Don't change. I love you, man,
the way you are.

42:56.381 --> 42:58.014
I need it to stay that way.

42:58.016 --> 43:00.082
All right? BFFs, remember?

43:00.084 --> 43:01.484
Yeah, forever. You know that.

43:01.486 --> 43:03.419
Okay. Well, it actually...
that's what it actually means

43:03.421 --> 43:04.854
is “best friends
forever,” but...

43:04.856 --> 43:06.288
You just did it then.

43:06.290 --> 43:07.723
I know. I did it on purpose.
Okay.

43:07.725 --> 43:09.358
Well, it's dismissive,
is all I'm trying to say.

43:09.360 --> 43:11.293
What's dismissive?
Well, when you roll your eyes, it feels...

43:11.295 --> 43:12.995
Sometimes you say things
that deserve an eye roll.

43:12.997 --> 43:14.063
<i>I don't know what to tell you.</i>

43:14.065 --> 43:15.331
<i>Yeah, maybe</i>
<i>I deserve an eye roll,</i>

43:15.333 --> 43:16.732
<i>but do I deserve
to be dismissed?</i>
