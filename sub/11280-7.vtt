EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #029
"Everybody Hates Promises"
CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:03.104 --> 00:04.605
CHRIS ROCK:
When I was elected president
of Corleone,

00:04.638 --> 00:06.574
my school was way ahead
of its time.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.608
The rest of the country

00:07.641 --> 00:10.378
didn't get a black president
until Clinton.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.047
Like all presidents,
I had made campaign promises

00:13.081 --> 00:14.648
that were going
to be hard to keep.

00:14.682 --> 00:18.052
I promise you no more
rope-climbing in gym

00:18.086 --> 00:21.355
unless your favorite sport
is climbing rope.

00:21.389 --> 00:25.726
I promise no more homework
on Saturday

00:25.759 --> 00:28.629
unless you got to be
in school on Sunday.

00:28.662 --> 00:32.566
I promise all our book reports
will be on books

00:32.600 --> 00:34.635
that were made into movies.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.271
I promise you rubber floors,

00:37.305 --> 00:38.772
so that when the bully
knocks you down,

00:38.806 --> 00:40.708
you'll bounce right back up.

00:40.741 --> 00:44.712
We've got spring break,
we've got summer break.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.847
What about a fall break
and a winter break?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.250
I don't want to come to school
when it's hot,

00:49.283 --> 00:52.553
so why would I want to come
to school when it's cold?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.588
CROWD:
Chris, Chris, Chris,
Chris, Chris, Chris!

00:54.622 --> 00:55.623
To win my office,

00:55.656 --> 00:57.658
I told them everything
they wanted to hear.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.726
There was only one problem.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.361
They listened.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.730
You promised
you'd take us to a Knicks game.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.865
You promised
I'd get a new locker.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.135
You promised I'd get a raise!

01:07.168 --> 01:08.869
You promised I'd get a shave.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.572
You promised we'd get
some real meat.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.741
Usted me prometí
de enseñarme ingles.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.576
What are you going
to do about it?

01:15.609 --> 01:17.778
I had no idea
what I was going to do.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.381
So I did what
all great leaders do.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.682
I'll get right on it.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.584
I promise.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.761
* Oh... make it funky now!

CHRIS:
My new promise
to keep my old promises

01:59.653 --> 02:01.922
was seen as very unpromising.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.357
Hey, Greg!

02:03.391 --> 02:05.893
"Hey, Greg"? Did you
see the school paper?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.928
We have a school paper?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.831
Bush wasn't the first president
who didn't read the paper.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.867
What did I lie about?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.636
Apparently you lied
about everything.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.770
The last true thing I said was,

02:16.804 --> 02:18.739
"My name is Chris and I'm
running for president."

02:18.772 --> 02:20.941
I didn't mean any
of that stuff.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.943
Caruso stole my speech.
He's no better than me.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.612
Yeah, but he didn't win.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.747
Now you're stuck with all
those campaign promises.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.416
All presidents lie
to get elected.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.617
What do they do?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.819
Distraction. They just force
the press to cover

02:31.852 --> 02:33.454
other, more benign issues,

02:33.487 --> 02:35.489
until the public loses
interest in the story.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.459
Maybe we should ignore the
problem till it goes away.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.329
I was thinking more like
setting the cafeteria on fire,

02:41.362 --> 02:42.896
but we'll try it
your way first.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.600
I'll get it.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.769
Oh, hi, Uncle Mike.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.571
Hi.
While I was looking for help,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.740
my Uncle Michael
was looking for a free meal.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.974
Big man!

02:54.007 --> 02:54.908
Hey, Uncle Mike.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.944
Hey, I didn't know y'all
was having dinner.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.979
Why would you?
It's only dinnertime.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.981
My Uncle Michael
didn't have a job,

03:01.014 --> 03:02.816
so he was always
free to stop by

03:02.850 --> 03:04.785
and free to eat some free food.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.854
I didn't know y'all
was having breakfast.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.524
I didn't know
y'all was having lunch.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.795
I didn't know y'all
was having pancakes.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.897
We're in a pancake house.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.832
My father and Michael
didn't get along

03:18.866 --> 03:19.867
because whatever
my father said,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.802
my uncle said the opposite.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.871
I like the Ford.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.906
I like the Chevy.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.941
I want to go
see Picasso.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.344
I want to go
see Matisse.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.445
Mmm.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.814
Tastes great.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.849
Less filling.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.752
ROCHELLE:
Uh... Chris,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.388
why don't you get
your uncle a plate?

03:40.421 --> 03:43.257
Mama, can you teach me how
to double Dutch?

03:43.291 --> 03:44.625
You don't know how
to double Dutch?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.294
It's easy.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.928
If it's so easy,
why don't you teach her?

03:47.961 --> 03:48.796
That's a girl game.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.265
How do you know to
double Dutch anyway?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.833
I don't know. Just do.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.635
So are you gonna teach me?

03:54.668 --> 03:55.569
No.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.570
Yeah.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.705
MICHAEL:
So, Chris,

03:57.738 --> 03:58.839
what's up with you?

03:58.872 --> 03:59.840
Well, I was voted

03:59.873 --> 04:01.842
eighth grade class president.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.545
Uh-oh! Just like
Jesse Jackson.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.813
Ronald Reagan is the president.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.815
Jesse Jackson's just a resident.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.018
You might like Reagan,
but he don't like you.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.453
I like my nephew.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.454
Black president.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.657
Way to go, yo.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.593
Uncle Michael had finished
dinner, but he wasn't finished.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.961
That was good, 'Chelle.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.963
Oh, thanks. How's Momma?

04:22.996 --> 04:23.997
She threw me out.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.333
Threw you out?!

04:25.366 --> 04:26.500
Well, what happened?

04:26.534 --> 04:29.303
You know how Momma always
give you half of something.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.839
Well, there was a piece of
cake in the refrigerator.

04:31.872 --> 04:32.840
So I ate the whole thing.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.009
Next thing I know,
she just started tripping.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.978
Talk about,
"You eat up everything.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.448
You need to get a job
and buy your own cake."

04:40.481 --> 04:41.515
You believe that?

04:41.549 --> 04:44.051
Yes.
Momma been tripping
since Daddy died.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.353
Well, where are you staying?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.755
I was wondering if
I could stay here

04:47.788 --> 04:48.889
with you a couple days.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.958
Oh, I don't know, Michael.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.660
I gotta ask Julius that.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.861
Thank you, sis.

04:53.894 --> 04:54.995
You know I love you.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.431
Translation:
"Where am I sleeping?"

04:57.465 --> 04:59.433
"Will President be Impeached"?

04:59.467 --> 05:01.301
Who's talking about
you getting impeached?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.840
Maybe it's about time
we start thinking

05:06.874 --> 05:08.476
about that cafeteria fire.

05:14.948 --> 05:18.719
My father was tired from work
and tired of Uncle Michael.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.853
Where's Uncle Michael?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.655
Oh, he's upstairs
asleep in my room.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.925
Sounds like a night
at the Neverland Ranch.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.594
You all right?

05:26.627 --> 05:29.997
Mmm, yeah. I'm just
having some problems at school.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.700
You're president. What kind
of problems could you have?

05:32.733 --> 05:35.536
I made some campaign promises
that I can't deliver.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.005
So now they want to impeach me.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.039
That's what you get.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.874
What?

05:40.908 --> 05:43.811
How would you like it if I said
I was gonna do something for you

05:43.844 --> 05:44.678
and didn't
do it?

05:44.712 --> 05:48.081
Oh. Okay, so then
what should I do?

05:48.115 --> 05:51.485
I don't know. I didn't promise
to tell you what to do,

05:51.519 --> 05:53.153
but you got yourself
in this mess.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.888
Whatever happens, happens,

05:54.922 --> 05:56.590
but it's your responsibility.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.826
My father didn't believe
in making promises,

05:58.859 --> 06:01.829
which was tough for him
because they were free.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.165
Back at school, it was
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Truth.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.067
Why did you write all
this stuff about me?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.602
And who said
I was getting impeached?

06:08.636 --> 06:10.037
It doesn't say
you're getting impeached.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.072
It's asking, "Will you
get impeached?"

06:12.105 --> 06:14.007
Well, who asked
will I get impeached?

06:14.041 --> 06:14.975
My sources.

06:15.008 --> 06:15.943
What sources?

06:15.976 --> 06:18.512
What would you think
if Chris got impeached?

06:18.546 --> 06:20.414
Is Chris going to be impeached?

06:20.448 --> 06:21.749
I think you're a fraud.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.050
I think you were
lying then, and

06:23.083 --> 06:24.418
I think you're lying now.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.919
This is totally unfair
because you've got

06:25.953 --> 06:27.087
a personal ax to grind.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.121
What ax?

06:28.155 --> 06:29.156
Your boyfriend Ping is running

06:29.189 --> 06:30.424
with Caruso
and he lost.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.559
You just want revenge.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.093
Ping is not my boyfriend.

06:33.126 --> 06:33.894
He's not?

06:33.927 --> 06:34.795
No.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.129
Say, what are you
doing after school?

06:36.163 --> 06:37.030
Greg.

06:37.064 --> 06:37.931
Sorry.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.033
I'm gonna continue
to pursue the truth

06:40.067 --> 06:42.069
wherever it leads me.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.671
Now get out of my office.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.672
Fine.
Fine

06:44.705 --> 06:47.107
That was fair and balanced.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.209
While Lisa was
in pursuit of the truth,

06:49.242 --> 06:51.612
Uncle Michael was in pursuit
of a snooze.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.691
I got my first lesson in ethics

07:03.724 --> 07:05.926
and Tonya was getting hers
in double Dutch.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.531
Drew, I'm ready for you to
teach me how to double Dutch.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.032
Double Dutch is hard.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.767
I mean, you can't just
jump right into it.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.569
How come?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.571
'Cause double Dutch
is a serious sport.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.172
What do you think this is,
single Dutch?

07:19.206 --> 07:21.141
No.
Okay, then.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.876
You can start by stretching.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.077
Can you touch
your toes?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.084
How many times?

07:31.118 --> 07:34.054
I'll let you know.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.489
Just keep stretching.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.258
And after this,
we'll do knee bends.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.229
Tonya got stretched, and so
did my father's patience.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.097
Why is your brother
sleeping on my couch?

07:44.131 --> 07:47.100
Him and Momma got
into a little fight.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.569
It'll just be for a few days.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.637
You couldn't ask me?

07:49.670 --> 07:50.871
I was going to.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.940
I don't want my kids
waking up in the morning

07:52.973 --> 07:55.108
getting used to seeing a grown
man sleeping on the couch.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.245
Don't worry, Julius,
he'll be gone soon.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.246
How soon?

07:59.279 --> 08:03.050
Julius, he's family, okay?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.117
Just be patient.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.152
Big man!

08:07.154 --> 08:09.557
That couch is kinda rough.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.192
'Chelle, did you make
anything to eat?

08:12.225 --> 08:13.861
I'm hungry.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.262
Better make that food to go.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.632
Michael, didn't you
eat last night?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.934
Yeah.
It's afternoon now.

08:20.968 --> 08:24.638
86... 87... 88...

08:24.672 --> 08:25.739
89...
What you doing?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.007
Jumping jacks.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.708
Why?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.109
Because Drew's gonna teach me

08:29.142 --> 08:30.243
how to double Dutch.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.079
By doing jumping jacks?

08:32.112 --> 08:34.314
He says it's gonna
build up my endurance.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.817
Drew!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.552
Come in the house,
it's time to eat.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.754
Come on.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.226
Hey, Tonya. Tomorrow,
we'll work on your footwork.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.195
I thought you said
we were gonna work

08:48.228 --> 08:49.129
on hand-eye coordination.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.798
That's the day after tomorrow.

08:50.831 --> 08:51.999
Come on.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.967
While Drew
gave Tonya the runaround,

08:54.001 --> 08:56.203
Uncle Michael just ate
and sat around.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.138
Mmm. This is good.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.207
So, how you doing,
Mr. President?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.208
Not so good.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.677
Why, baby

09:03.711 --> 09:04.812
Well, being class president

09:04.845 --> 09:07.080
is a little bit harder
than I thought.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.182
You gotta pay the cost
to be the boss.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.317
Ha-ha! I know that's right.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.952
Y'all listen to your uncle.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.587
She didn't say that
when he told us

09:13.621 --> 09:15.255
to invest our money
in parachute pants.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.256
TONYA:
Hey, Daddy.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.257
Hey.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.159
Big man! Sit down

09:19.192 --> 09:21.194
and have some
of this chicken.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.330
Mmm. It's good...

09:23.363 --> 09:26.133
That look means, "You're lucky
I don't have heat vision."

09:26.166 --> 09:28.969
Baby, why don't you
come over here and sit down?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.738
I-I'll get you
a dinner plate.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.646
So, uh, you been out
all day looking for work?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.113
No, I've been here all day.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.348
Why is that?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.716
It's cold out there,

09:42.750 --> 09:43.984
but it's warm in here.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.686
Um...

09:45.719 --> 09:48.188
Michael, why don't you
run out to the store

09:48.221 --> 09:49.623
and, uh, get us some Nestea?

09:49.657 --> 09:51.258
But The A Team
about to come on.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.626
That's my program.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.628
I love me
some Mr. T.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.096
"I pity the fool."

09:56.129 --> 09:57.698
That's my boy.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.666
Michael!

09:58.699 --> 10:00.233
Go get the Nestea.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.308
Here you go, baby.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.377
Okay?

10:10.410 --> 10:13.146
Now, is there anything else
I could get for you?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.849
No. I just want
to sit in my chair.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.351
That face means
there's nothing worse

10:18.385 --> 10:20.888
than sitting on a hot chair
warmed by a lazy ass.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.356
Mommy made you
really good spinach.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.259
Mmm! Yummy.
Mm! Mm!

10:28.696 --> 10:31.899
Michael, you talk
to Momma yet?

10:31.932 --> 10:35.035
Nah. I'm giving her a chance
to calm down.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.236
You got to leave.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.005
If Julius finds you
here tomorrow,

10:38.038 --> 10:40.107
I don't know
what he's going to do.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.210
If I go home, I don't know
what Momma gonna do.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.278
You got one more night.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.147
Okay, 'Chelle.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.249
Dang.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.021
And stay out of Julius' chair.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.893
Back at school,
I stopped making promises,

10:59.927 --> 11:01.729
and started making demands.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.097
I'd like all book reports
to be on books

11:04.131 --> 11:06.133
that were made into movies.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.836
Are you high?

11:10.070 --> 11:11.805
I'm asking, not judging.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.173
No.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.342
I'm just trying
to fulfill my campaign promises.

11:15.375 --> 11:19.212
Just for curiosity's sake,
what else did you promise?

11:19.246 --> 11:21.749
A TV in the library,
more field trips,

11:21.782 --> 11:24.117
instituting recess,
and no more detention.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.353
Chris, how are you going
to know how to act

11:26.386 --> 11:28.255
when you get stopped
by the police

11:28.288 --> 11:29.723
if we don't give you detention?

11:29.757 --> 11:32.325
Let me explain something
to you, Chris.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.228
The Office of Class President
is titular.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.296
What

11:36.329 --> 11:37.297
Titular, Chris.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.033
It means you don't have
any power, just a title.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.435
The first thing
I should have done as President

11:42.469 --> 11:44.337
was change the meaning
of "titular."

11:44.371 --> 11:47.140
Well, you're saying that,
even though I'm Class President,

11:47.174 --> 11:49.176
I can't change anything
around here?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.177
Exactly.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.112
Well, if I don't have any power,

11:52.145 --> 11:53.881
how can you let them impeach me?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.983
I mean, come on,
I can't do anything.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.351
Can I at least
get French fries at lunch?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.221
I always thought you'd be more
the sweet potato type.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.423
MRS. MILONE:
The point is, Chris,

12:03.456 --> 12:04.457
the students run the
student government,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.126
and they can do
what they want.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.761
And I can't do anything.

12:07.795 --> 12:08.796
That's not true.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.030
Maybe you can talk them into

12:10.063 --> 12:11.064
letting you stay in office.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.465
That's a good idea.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.301
Give another one
of those speeches.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.336
But if I can make
a suggestion,

12:16.369 --> 12:21.474
maybe this time
you should try rhyming.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.176
Maybe you should try Prozac.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.045
Did you know
I didn't have any power?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.947
What are you
talking about
you got no power?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.115
You're the president.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.951
I'm a figurehead,
like Mayor McCheese,

12:30.984 --> 12:34.788
like Colonel Sanders,
like Dr. Detroit.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.390
Dipaolo told a guy we were going
to put cherry Kool-Aid

12:37.424 --> 12:38.826
in the water fountains.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.093
Dipaolo?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.095
Well, that was
another bad idea.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.263
Tell me about it.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.433
I thought being president
would help make us more popular

12:46.466 --> 12:47.734
and help solve some problems.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.170
All it did was cause
more problems and make
more people hate you.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.172
Here he is!
Well, at least things
can't get worse... Hey!

12:53.406 --> 12:55.275
Gotcha!

12:55.308 --> 12:57.344
You think you can steal my stuff
and get away with it?

12:57.377 --> 12:58.511
I didn't take this.
These kids ran by

12:58.545 --> 12:59.847
and they dropped it
on my table!

12:59.880 --> 13:01.281
Good, tell it
to the police.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.349
Greg, where you going?!
Come on.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.952
While he's grabbing me,
three white kids grabbed

13:04.985 --> 13:06.586
everything in
his cash register.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.555
It wasn't me!
Shut up! Shut up!

13:13.226 --> 13:16.864
"Heist By Class President Foiled
as Impeachment Looms"?

13:16.897 --> 13:18.365
GREG:
This is outrageous!

13:18.398 --> 13:20.467
How are you going
to call me a liar?

13:20.500 --> 13:21.434
You're the liar.
I'm not guilty.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.536
They found the real guys
five minutes later.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.273
I had a deadline. School was out
in an hour and a half.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.274
You couldn't wait 30 minutes

13:27.307 --> 13:29.476
to find out whether your story
was true or not?

13:29.509 --> 13:32.545
You're the class president,
this is the news.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.513
We wouldn't have printed it

13:33.546 --> 13:36.383
if you hadn't exhibited
a pattern of behavior.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.918
What pattern?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.552
Maybe I was guilty.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.988
You're supposed
to be a journalist.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.056
You can't in
good conscience
let this stand

13:43.090 --> 13:44.357
without printing
a retraction.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.625
He's gonna lose
his office.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.461
I promise I'll print
a retraction.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.933
What are you gonna do?

13:52.966 --> 13:56.403
I don't know.
What can I do?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.906
While I was hoping
Lisa kept her promise,

13:58.939 --> 14:00.273
Tonya was showing some promise.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.075
How much longer, Drew?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.610
I'll tell you.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.013
And after this,
you'll do wind sprints.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.614
Dang!

14:07.647 --> 14:10.517
Tonya trained harder
than Rocky.

14:12.519 --> 14:17.024
My uncle hated to work so much,
he left a lazy stain.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.191
Big man!

14:18.225 --> 14:19.526
Is that my shirt?

14:19.559 --> 14:22.629
I didn't even see that.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.630
Popcorn?

14:25.498 --> 14:27.634
Julius, let me explain.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.003
I don't want to know,
I don't want to understand,

14:30.037 --> 14:31.438
I don't even want to hear it.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.539
I just want him gone.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.441
Well, he has no place to go.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.642
I don't care.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.444
Him and my mother had a fight.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.246
He about
to have a fight with me.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.548
What's he doing
with my shirt on?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.184
Well, he spilled chocolate sauce
on his.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.186
My chocolate sauce?
Well...

14:46.219 --> 14:47.955
Now he's spilling my food,
he's wearing my shirt,

14:47.988 --> 14:49.923
sitting on my couch,
eating my popcorn,

14:49.957 --> 14:52.259
watching my television,
burning my electricity.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.127
Julius, he's my brother.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.599
Okay. How much longer
do I have to deal with this?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.234
Not much longer.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.571
Baby, because you're so
understanding about this,

15:04.604 --> 15:09.642
I am going to make your favorite
cheese grits for breakfast.

15:09.676 --> 15:10.510
Cheese grits?

15:10.543 --> 15:11.578
Uh-huh.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.546
I love them cheese grits.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.614
I know you do.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.985
Baby, I promise you
he'll be gone by tomorrow, okay?

15:18.018 --> 15:21.054
My dad had heard that before;
I think it was yesterday.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.122
Extra cheese?

15:22.155 --> 15:24.124
Extra cheese,
sharp cheddar.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.292
Sharp cheddar.
Sharp cheddar.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.328
MRS. MILONE:
Inasmuch as our own student
government

15:28.361 --> 15:30.964
reflects the reality
of our actual government,

15:30.998 --> 15:33.633
malfeasance on the part
of our seated president

15:33.666 --> 15:36.003
has brought us to this
impeachment hearing.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.239
All right, Kingfish,
you got the floor.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.342
Okay, over the past few days,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.377
rumors have been circulated
about me.

15:44.411 --> 15:48.348
The press have put out stories

15:48.381 --> 15:50.583
saying that I'm guilty
of a lot of things.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.419
Are you done?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.054
No.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.655
I didn't do any of those things.

15:55.688 --> 15:56.556
I'm not a crook.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.226
Nevertheless...

15:59.259 --> 16:01.194
After talking to Greg,

16:01.228 --> 16:03.563
I imagined what my father
would say to me.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.731
So you're just gonna
quit, huh?

16:04.764 --> 16:08.135
All these people who made it
possible for you to become

16:08.168 --> 16:11.771
the first black class president,
and now you're just gonna quit?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.341
Yeah, and what if we quit?

16:14.374 --> 16:16.576
Black people would never have
become pilots.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.746
If I had quit, pancakes
would taste like crap!

16:19.779 --> 16:22.315
If I had quit, Cream of Wheat
would have been called

16:22.349 --> 16:23.750
Cream of White!

16:23.783 --> 16:28.155
If I had quit, it would take
hours to cook rice.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.491
Chris,
I know you don't think

16:31.524 --> 16:32.659
being eight-grade class
president

16:32.692 --> 16:37.264
is a big deal,
but one day it will be.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.102
If people tell you enough times
that you're wrong,

16:42.135 --> 16:44.137
sometimes you forget
that you're right.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.672
They could impeach me
if they wanted,

16:45.705 --> 16:47.774
but I wasn't going
to stand there

16:47.807 --> 16:50.377
and let them call me
a liar and a cheat.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.345
The reason I'm here now
is because the newspaper

16:52.379 --> 16:55.615
has put out stories saying
that I lied and I cheated.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.284
And I promised you

16:57.317 --> 16:59.519
that I would try to change
things around here.

16:59.552 --> 17:03.223
Well, I tried,
and it didn't work.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.126
Well, at least not yet.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.262
I still want to be
your class president,

17:09.296 --> 17:12.632
it's just that I need another
chance to make things right.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.135
Y'all believed in me before.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.437
You can keep believing
in me now.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.206
Fight the power, Chris.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.773
Fight the power.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.709
JOEY:
All right, all those
in favor

17:22.742 --> 17:25.078
of impeaching Chris,
raise their hand and say "Aye."

17:25.112 --> 17:27.447
ALL:
Aye!

17:27.480 --> 17:28.581
What?

17:28.615 --> 17:30.783
All right, the ayes have it.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.018
You're impeached.

17:32.051 --> 17:36.489
I didn't even get a chance
to touch a fat white woman.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.828
Hey, how come
you're not training?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.730
Because Drew lied to me.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.333
I did everything he asked.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.102
I ran through tires,
I did wind sprints

17:49.136 --> 17:50.803
and I still
can't double Dutch.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.439
Well, I'll help you.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.406
You will?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.073
Yeah.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.577
You already know how to do this.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.747
Just count it out
and when I say "go," go.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.316
Okay, ready... go.

18:03.350 --> 18:07.654
* Oh... cut footloose

18:07.687 --> 18:10.790
* Oh, cut footloose
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

18:10.823 --> 18:11.824
Thanks, Drew.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.794
What?

18:29.909 --> 18:31.844
Big man!

18:31.878 --> 18:34.214
I see why
these cheese grits

18:34.247 --> 18:36.883
are your favorite.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.186
Mm-mm.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.358
Julius, come on, man!

18:45.392 --> 18:47.794
I said I'm sorry, man!

18:47.827 --> 18:48.728
Julius!

18:48.761 --> 18:50.430
What?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.765
Can I at least get my clothes,
man?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.501
You want your clothes?

18:54.534 --> 18:57.870
I got your clothes.
I got your clothes.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.607
That's for eating
my cheese grits.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.776
Julius, this is
wrong, man.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.778
I'm gonna tell 'Chelle
about this!

19:05.812 --> 19:06.646
What you looking at?!

19:06.679 --> 19:09.249
You ain't never been throwed out
before?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.750
This is wrong, man!

19:10.783 --> 19:12.018
Over some grits?!

19:12.051 --> 19:14.887
My father eventually came
downstairs to return his sock,

19:14.921 --> 19:15.822
but he shoved it somewhere

19:15.855 --> 19:17.757
that Uncle Michael
couldn't reach it.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.959
I need a ride, man!

19:19.992 --> 19:22.229
Getting impeached taught me
a valuable lesson:

19:22.262 --> 19:23.730
only make promises
you can keep.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.732
From then on, I just promised
to eat pizza

19:25.765 --> 19:26.866
and watch the Knicks game.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.868
She promised
a retraction. Here it is.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.505
Do you see this?
This is tinier than

19:32.539 --> 19:34.374
the print in the Bazooka
Joe comic strip.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.477
Well, we had a good run
and we made history.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.711
Yeah, I know.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.913
I was the first class
president ever to
be impeached.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.583
I wonder who's
going to replace you.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.318
Probably Dipaolo.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.654
Great, we're gonna have
an idiot for president.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.890
Who knew Greg could see
into the future?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.659
See you later.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.364
Hey, check this out.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.967
There's cherry Kool-Aid coming
out of the water fountain.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.739
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:09.909 --> 20:13.880
