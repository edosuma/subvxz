00:26.611 --> 00:29.398
Babe?
Are you okay?

00:33.618 --> 00:35.028
ljust couldn't sleep.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.654
Another bad dream?

00:36.913 --> 00:40.451
Look, I know that I haven't
exactly been myself lately.

00:41.334 --> 00:42.369
It's okay.

00:42.627 --> 00:45.084
And you have
been so patient.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.291
I'm a husband.
That's my job.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.789
| just wanted to be
sure before I told you.

00:50.051 --> 00:52.383
Okay, now you're starting
to freak me out a little.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.804
For the last few days...

00:57.058 --> 00:58.923
| feel like I've
been going crazy.

00:59.185 --> 00:59.640
What's wrong?

00:59.894 --> 01:03.057
The things that l have
been thinking and seeing...

01:08.402 --> 01:10.939
I'm pregnant.

01:12.198 --> 01:15.315
[Laughing]

01:20.581 --> 01:23.163
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.912
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.665
My love carries
a death sentence.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.543
l was lost for years...

01:31.801 --> 01:33.757
Searching while hiding.

01:34.512 --> 01:37.879
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

01:38.516 --> 01:40.052
I won't hide anymore.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.766
I will live
the life I choose.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.400
Hi!

01:56.826 --> 01:57.781
I'm Bo.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.195
[Whack!]

02:02.999 --> 02:05.035
Mild weather
we're having?

02:11.090 --> 02:11.840
Hey.

02:12.091 --> 02:12.750
How you feeling?

02:13.009 --> 02:13.794
[Panting]

02:14.051 --> 02:15.666
Like Wile. E. Coyote...

02:15.928 --> 02:16.758
You?

02:17.013 --> 02:18.594
Yeah, he's fast--

02:19.056 --> 02:20.592
But Stella says
I need him.

02:21.017 --> 02:21.802
Well, his sweat.

02:22.059 --> 02:22.764
Right, right...
At least we're not

02:23.019 --> 02:25.260
risking a heart attack
for something gross.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.681
He secretes
pheromones I need

02:26.939 --> 02:28.600
to gain entrance
into the Temple.

02:28.858 --> 02:29.722
He's an Oo'Glug.

02:29.984 --> 02:30.894
Didn't Trick tell you?

02:31.152 --> 02:33.108
Me and Trick only talk
sweat on Tuesdays.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.148
We gangsta like that.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.361
Anyway, not that
I don't enjoy this rest--

02:39.618 --> 02:41.324
but doesn't the most
important ceremony

02:41.579 --> 02:43.319
of your life start
in like an hour?

02:43.581 --> 02:45.037
Yeah, you're right.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.531
Break's over.

02:47.418 --> 02:49.249
No, |--!
No, I take it back!

02:49.503 --> 02:51.414
We have plenty of time!

02:51.672 --> 02:54.004
Where's the ACME company
when you need 'em?!

02:54.550 --> 02:55.209
Wait!

02:59.055 --> 03:00.545
Where'd he go?

03:03.225 --> 03:05.762
Okay-- Enough
with the chasing.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.351
Phone me.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.310
[Panting]
Okay.

03:12.568 --> 03:16.060
Ha! Looks like our boy is
about to run out of runway.

03:16.322 --> 03:18.153
This leads straight
to a dead end street

03:18.407 --> 03:19.271
in the warehouse district.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.648
Our luck
might be changing.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.366
I'd just like
to point out that

03:22.620 --> 03:25.236
no escape for him
means no escape for us.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.913
Yeah.
Can I have that back?

03:28.167 --> 03:28.792
No.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.783
| just want to check
my messages.

03:31.045 --> 03:31.875
Relax.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.869
There could be any
number of reasons

03:34.131 --> 03:35.462
why Lauren hasn't
returned a single

03:35.716 --> 03:36.796
one of your
twenty-seven texts.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.962
Like, I blew her off
to play Spaghetti Western

03:39.220 --> 03:40.380
in Brazenwood
with Tamsin?

03:40.638 --> 03:42.094
Give her some
more cred, huh?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.805
And that was
kind of insensitive.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.258
You and Tamsin sitting
in Lauren's apartment,

03:47.520 --> 03:48.726
sharing a glass
of chardonnay.

03:48.979 --> 03:49.729
It was champagne.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.356
Oh, dude.

03:51.774 --> 03:52.638
Much worse.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.685
And a kiss.

03:53.943 --> 03:54.557
A what?!

03:54.819 --> 03:55.308
Hey!

03:55.569 --> 03:56.228
Come on,
short stack!

03:56.487 --> 03:57.772
You get back here,
younglady,

03:58.030 --> 04:00.021
and tell me
about this kiss!

04:01.117 --> 04:03.483
This kind of friendship
has rules, you know!

04:07.039 --> 04:07.744
Hi.

04:07.998 --> 04:08.987
Hello.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.867
Hale, uh, wanted me
to bring these by.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.040
You could've
sent a messenger.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.582
l was heading this way.

04:16.841 --> 04:18.047
Just been working
on an antidote

04:18.300 --> 04:20.586
for Bo's... situation.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.382
I'm not sensing
the thrill of victory.

04:23.639 --> 04:27.177
Yeah well, this upcoming Dawning
ceremony has me worried, Dyson.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.470
Yeah, me too.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.934
ljust wish that I could
find some way to slow down

04:31.188 --> 04:33.725
or even arrest,
Bo's decline...

04:33.983 --> 04:36.349
Do you know that
l have a hard time believing

04:36.610 --> 04:38.896
that I ever found
someone like Bo?

04:41.115 --> 04:43.197
That she even exists.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.527
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.038
It's gonna be fine.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.578
I got a good
feeling about it.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.167
[Laughing]

04:56.630 --> 04:57.289
Well.

04:57.548 --> 05:01.166
l have a hard time
measuring "good feelings."

05:01.427 --> 05:02.792
Scientifically speaking.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.760
Yeah, sometimes it's not
about what you can prove--

05:06.015 --> 05:07.380
It's about
what you believe.

05:09.185 --> 05:10.470
Lauren...

05:11.187 --> 05:14.725
I'm really glad that you and Bo
are in such a good place.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.824
Time to get
our Oo'Glug on.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.822
Please let me
live to regret this.

05:35.044 --> 05:41.756
[Dance music playing]

05:42.009 --> 05:43.374
Uh... whoa--

05:44.011 --> 05:46.127
Sweat boy knows
how to get down...

05:47.056 --> 05:48.091
Lacey...

05:50.684 --> 05:52.720
What the hell is this?

05:53.604 --> 05:55.310
They've been
waiting for you, Bo.

05:57.233 --> 06:00.566
Welcome to the first
phase of your Dawning.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.109
To do what with?

06:10.371 --> 06:11.952
To feast on, of course.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.743
To satiate yourself before
entering The Dawning.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.615
That is
Victoria's secret!

06:16.877 --> 06:19.994
Are you telling me this whole
quest for the Oo'Glog sweat--

06:20.256 --> 06:22.747
His name is Keith, he's one
of my regular players.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.090
It was all a setup
just to get me here.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.050
Re-volting!

06:30.349 --> 06:32.510
Is that brand name liquor?

06:40.192 --> 06:41.932
You're Bo...

06:42.194 --> 06:43.354
The agent from Rio.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.527
I didn't think you
were gonna be so...

06:50.327 --> 06:51.407
...stunning.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.492
We're gonna
have so much fun.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.786
Oh, bitch...

07:03.048 --> 07:04.379
...you are evil.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.879
Why?

07:08.137 --> 07:09.547
Because I seem
to be the only one

07:09.805 --> 07:11.887
not denying you're
a Succubus?

07:12.141 --> 07:14.097
I know you're tempted.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.891
Take her.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.476
Take them all.

07:18.564 --> 07:21.931
Fully fed is the safest
way to enter the Temple.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.181
No.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.149
Then take him.

07:24.403 --> 07:27.019
The Morrigan signed him
to an exclusive contract.

07:27.990 --> 07:28.319
I'm leaving.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.110
He'll be dead in
six months anyway--

07:30.367 --> 07:31.573
Not by my hand.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.527
Look how tired you
are from chasing Keith.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.324
Multiply that
ten times over

07:38.584 --> 07:40.916
the grueling trials
The Dawning will throw at you.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.912
Alright, I think we're
just about done here...

07:45.507 --> 07:47.919
Your empathy for the human
species is commendable.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.293
But it's not the
ancient way of the Fae.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.714
Maybe not.

07:52.765 --> 07:53.675
But it's my way.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.923
You keep saying
I don't know who I am?

07:56.185 --> 07:57.095
Well, I know this...

07:57.353 --> 08:01.187
I will not murder
for pleasure.

08:02.566 --> 08:06.980
Without a full feed,
she will fail The Dawning.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.145
She will devolve.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.070
She will die.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.738
She will surprise
the shit out of you.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.825
And you know, you'd think
I'd get tired of watching, but--

08:19.375 --> 08:20.581
I never do.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.783
And I never will.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.164
Stell.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.299
I can't believe her.

08:31.762 --> 08:34.720
I mean-- Who the hell
does she think she is?

08:35.766 --> 08:37.722
Careful baby.
Mama likes her wine.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.718
Just when I think I am on
board with all things Fae--

08:40.979 --> 08:43.061
--you kiss the girl that
tried to put you in jail.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.727
They turn around and pull
sneaky shit like this!

08:45.984 --> 08:47.724
And l was gonna
tell you about that.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.362
It's fine.
Bigger fish to fry.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.695
We'll talk Valkyrie-lips
when you return.

08:51.949 --> 08:52.779
'Cause you will.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.525
Stella is being so vague about
my time in the Temple.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.153
And who knows what will
happen if I come out!

09:01.291 --> 09:02.371
What are
you thinking?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.082
I'm thinking:

09:04.336 --> 09:06.497
what happens to cats
when their owners die?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.546
Who's gonna pay
the hydro bill...

09:09.800 --> 09:12.166
What even is hydro?

09:12.761 --> 09:13.090
Kenzi--

09:13.345 --> 09:14.380
No.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.878
No!
No,duden

09:16.140 --> 09:18.882
You have been
training non-stop.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.384
Dude.
You've got this.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.761
If anything
happens to me...

09:24.022 --> 09:26.764
you gotta know that
you are taken care of.

09:28.152 --> 09:29.107
Don't worry.

09:29.361 --> 09:29.941
No, no.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.901
This is not
my worried face.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.317
This is my game face.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.736
I know that you're
gonna get through this.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.155
And I'm gonna be on
the other side with mojitos.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.653
Because horns or not,

09:40.914 --> 09:42.996
we gettin' drunk
when this is done.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.712
What if I'm drooling
and have back hair?

09:50.966 --> 09:52.831
We will...
get you waxed!

09:54.178 --> 09:55.918
You'll always
be my girl, Bo.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.796
Even if you do come
outta there with a dong.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.139
Ow!

10:01.393 --> 10:02.018
No dong.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.304
No dong.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.518
There's never been a human
present at a Dawning before.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.146
Chill, Stell.
I promise not to tweet.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.527
It's simply
not appropriate.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.026
Bo is my BFF...

10:20.287 --> 10:23.745
which stands for
Best Fae Forever.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.955
So this is one chick
whose pretty Pradas

10:26.210 --> 10:27.541
are nailed
to the ground.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.004
Your scars are so deep.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.122
What?

10:48.649 --> 10:49.729
Hey, Lo...

10:49.983 --> 10:52.144
Look, I am not
trying to stalk you.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.311
ljust,
I'm wondering if, uh--

11:01.578 --> 11:03.955
l was afraid
you wouldn't come.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.037
I wouldn't miss this
for the world, Bo.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.328
So those twenty-seven texts
that you didn't answer...

11:09.586 --> 11:10.575
I've been working
like a demon

11:10.838 --> 11:12.749
trying to find a serum,
or an antibody,

11:13.006 --> 11:13.961
just something
that might--

11:14.216 --> 11:15.922
Hey.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.791
It's okay, babe.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.384
It's not.

11:19.763 --> 11:20.718
TRICK: Friends!

11:20.973 --> 11:22.588
Can I have
your attention please?

11:25.769 --> 11:28.101
A toast,
to my granddaughter.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.970
I'm so very proud of you.

11:30.232 --> 11:30.982
We all are.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.189
You've been through
so much the last few years,

11:33.443 --> 11:35.308
but you've always
stayed true to yourself.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.277
To your heart.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.023
May this Dawning be
your greatest triumph.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.612
Now come.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.830
It's time.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.138
Little Bolivian Marching powder
for the road, Scarface?

12:06.143 --> 12:10.307
The essence of white oleander
represents your purity.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.520
Oh, I'm afraid that
ship has sailed.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.898
Of intent
and deed.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.938
Of commitment
to the Dawning.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.025
I couldn't do it,
Trick.

12:21.283 --> 12:21.988
The full feed--

12:22.242 --> 12:24.107
I will never kill
innocents again.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.984
I would rather die.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.110
What are you
talking about?

12:27.372 --> 12:29.112
Stella's model buffet.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.244
Wait-- didn't you
know about that?

12:31.501 --> 12:33.162
No. I did not.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.750
I don't know if
I've ever thanked you.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.295
Properly.

12:42.137 --> 12:42.967
It's not necessary.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.677
No, but it is.

12:44.932 --> 12:48.299
I know that I haven't always
been the perfect granddaughter.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.472
And you have always
been there for me.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.521
Believing in me.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.356
Loving me.

12:58.362 --> 13:01.820
You have always exceeded
everyone's expectations.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.905
And this?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.150
This is not goodbye.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.327
Now...

13:13.377 --> 13:16.084
As a symbol
of your true self,

13:16.338 --> 13:19.421
while you are
in the temple.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.720
By embracing
the tradition,

13:34.982 --> 13:36.722
you acknowledge
your heritage.

13:40.821 --> 13:45.281
You are the only
"heritage" that l have left.

13:45.534 --> 13:49.573
Nothing is going to
take that away from me.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.912
"...and with full knowing
the initiate enters willingly

13:56.169 --> 13:59.252
"into the sacred ceremony."

13:59.506 --> 14:01.872
Do you accept
the invitation?

14:02.134 --> 14:02.793
I accept.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.292
The time has come for you
to choose an aide

14:05.554 --> 14:07.510
to take with you
into The Dawning.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.092
But you may not
choose a weapon

14:10.350 --> 14:12.341
until you choose a side.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.310
You already know my answer.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.930
Then you know
the consequences.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.056
Be it witnessed,
the initiate assents

14:20.318 --> 14:22.354
to enter
The Dawning unarmed.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.315
I offer myself as Hand.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.615
Like hell you do.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.244
Do you even know
what that means?

14:33.498 --> 14:35.284
I know when you're
up to no good.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.658
An initiate has the right
to select a "Hand",

14:37.919 --> 14:40.331
or... a companion
for the journey.

14:40.589 --> 14:43.046
It's not like we're
going camping, Dyson.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.085
Does he understand?

14:44.342 --> 14:46.298
The offer has been made.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.085
Do you accept?

14:48.346 --> 14:49.096
No way.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.507
Or-- maybe?

14:50.766 --> 14:51.505
Kenzi!

14:51.767 --> 14:53.632
Trick, would you please tell her
this is the right thing to do?

14:53.894 --> 14:54.849
LAUREN: It is.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.514
Any advantage.

15:01.068 --> 15:04.105
Dyson will
keep you safe.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.293
For luck.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.962
Believe me,
| feel lucky.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.877
I'll see you soon.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.632
Let's do it.

16:18.353 --> 16:32.154
[Music playing]

16:34.161 --> 16:35.867
Well, I hope you didn't
forget anything.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.910
"Temple", huh?

16:38.165 --> 16:40.281
I expected more marble.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.667
What, the Dawning couldn't have
sprung for a different bar?

16:45.797 --> 16:48.083
Well, at least the taps
are still working--

16:48.592 --> 16:50.457
Beer?

16:50.719 --> 16:52.880
What the hell did you
just do back there?

16:53.138 --> 16:55.595
The Dawning only happens
once in a Fae's life, Bo--

16:55.849 --> 16:57.259
And no matter how
this thing ends,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.132
yours is going
to be different.

16:59.728 --> 17:00.888
So...

17:02.939 --> 17:03.894
Might as well share
a drink with a friend

17:04.149 --> 17:05.059
while you still can, huh?

17:05.317 --> 17:07.103
Dyson, why are you here?

17:07.360 --> 17:08.896
Been wondering
that myself!

17:12.741 --> 17:15.073
No offence, Pal,
but friend or foe?

17:15.327 --> 17:18.911
Why don't you just
call me the Caretaker.

17:19.164 --> 17:22.031
I been here so long, I can't
rightly remember my given name.

17:22.292 --> 17:24.078
My mother
wouldn't approve but--

17:24.336 --> 17:27.453
I can't rightly remember
my mother's name either.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.040
Ha!

17:31.301 --> 17:33.166
Unaligned Succubus...

17:33.428 --> 17:34.463
Pretty sure
that's my name--

17:34.721 --> 17:36.257
Just when you think
you've seen it all.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.890
And believe me--
l have.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.256
Anyway, uh--

17:39.601 --> 17:43.059
Welcome to the Dawning,
etc, etc...

17:43.313 --> 17:45.429
See you brought
yourselfa hero, too.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.476
Tip my hat to you
if I were wearing one.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.270
You mind including me
in this little convo?

17:49.527 --> 17:50.903
It's kind
of my big night.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.610
DYSON: Yeah, please,
get to the point.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.320
This thing kinda
snuck up on Bo

17:54.574 --> 17:56.075
and we'd like
to get it done.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.361
It's pretty simple.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.735
Now that you're in the Temple,
ya need to get out.

17:59.996 --> 18:03.033
Care to tell me how
so maybe we can call it a day?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.451
[Laughing]

18:04.709 --> 18:06.040
You don't disappoint,
little lady.

18:06.294 --> 18:09.252
You've got a real spirit.
Very funny.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.667
Regardless you
still have to find--

18:11.925 --> 18:12.789
the Key.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.133
The Key you seek
unlocks the portal.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.503
Accept the Key,
in the form it is presented

18:17.764 --> 18:18.389
and you're free.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.426
Reject it, and well--

18:20.725 --> 18:23.307
Imagine slobbering
all over the place.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.643
Unable to remember
the people you love.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.603
UnderFae.
Got it.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.314
Until you find
the key is in hand--

18:31.152 --> 18:32.483
You won't go anywhere.

18:35.156 --> 18:35.861
Anywho!

18:36.116 --> 18:38.027
That's my time.
You've been great.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.697
[Music playing]

18:42.330 --> 18:44.286
Well, that was
quite the exit.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.418
So, what now?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.254
There's a half a
platter of nachos left?

19:00.515 --> 19:01.550
Not hungry.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.510
You wanna talk?

19:05.729 --> 19:07.469
Okay.

19:07.731 --> 19:10.643
Back when I got that
rash from the Kitsune

19:10.900 --> 19:13.983
and she Kenzi-napped me
and yadda yadda yadda...

19:15.155 --> 19:17.771
She told me that
I could be Fae.

19:18.742 --> 19:19.481
Did she now?

19:19.743 --> 19:22.485
Which--
lsn't really true.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.157
Is it?

19:25.415 --> 19:27.076
What did Stella
say to you?

19:27.334 --> 19:28.119
You looked upset.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.877
She told me what
happens to humans

19:30.128 --> 19:32.244
who are abandoned by
the Fae who claimed them.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.459
You're not Bo's pet.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.253
I'm not Fae either.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.670
Bo's very strong.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.466
l have every hope and faith
that she will emerge safely.

19:42.724 --> 19:43.554
And if she doesn't?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.184
Hale or Dyson
could use someone

19:45.435 --> 19:46.550
to do chores
around their house.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.427
Don't play me, homie.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.475
I suppose...

19:52.525 --> 19:54.902
|f Bo weren't
around anymore--

19:55.362 --> 19:56.477
I could claim you.

19:56.738 --> 19:57.693
Get out.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.687
Even though
I have no right to,

19:59.949 --> 20:02.201
I've come to think
of you as family, Kenzi.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.692
I hope you don't mind.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.445
Well, it's a little
presumptuous but--

20:07.707 --> 20:09.163
if you must.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.453
And for however
long you want it,

20:11.711 --> 20:14.202
you have a place
in my world.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.874
Our world.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.379
Thank you.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.892
Okay, so now what?
We--

20:30.146 --> 20:31.306
We sit and wait?

20:31.564 --> 20:32.679
Nope.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.017

20:51.501 --> 20:53.082
Okay... pretty
sure my front door

20:53.336 --> 20:54.667
never lead to the Dal.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.628
Although some
nights I wish it did.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.253
Does this seem
weird to you?

21:01.511 --> 21:03.467
My place, I mean.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.257
Everything's off.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.257
To be more honest than
a wolf probably should--

else besides your bedroom.

done the same for me.

24:44.317 --> 24:45.682
Don't you get it?

24:45.943 --> 24:47.069
We're moving on.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.940
Or at least, Bo is.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.572
Where is she?!

24:59.123 --> 25:01.159
Good mornin', partner.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.330
Bo?

25:08.675 --> 25:10.381
You're looking
kind of pale.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.045
Did you and
"Jason" break up?

25:12.303 --> 25:14.544
Oh, God,
can we not today?

25:14.806 --> 25:16.137
lam so tired.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.551
Bad dream again?

25:17.809 --> 25:18.423
Yeah.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.801
And no,
you weren't in it.

25:21.229 --> 25:22.093
The monster?

25:22.355 --> 25:23.390
Yeah...

25:24.857 --> 25:27.564
|t's chasing me,
or I'm chasing it.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.437
But anyway--

25:30.822 --> 25:32.483
You know, there was
a time, I would be

25:32.740 --> 25:34.355
in your dreams
to save you.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.865
lnever
needed saving.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.910
You know, you don't have to read
into everything I do or say.

25:43.626 --> 25:44.957
You don't want
me anymore.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.169
That's fine.
I'm just trying to help.

25:49.632 --> 25:52.044
Can't you just
be happy for me?

25:52.301 --> 25:54.758
lam.

25:55.012 --> 25:58.004
That C.|. that you groomed
to testify against the Family?

25:58.391 --> 25:59.301
She's getting
cold feet.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.765
What?

26:03.438 --> 26:04.553
Wrong file.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.601
Oh...

26:08.818 --> 26:10.934
We are so close on this.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.818
She is our only key.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.773
Key...

26:18.411 --> 26:20.276
I mean, lead.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.119
On the case.

26:22.373 --> 26:25.740
Without her, we have no way
to take down The Family.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.585
Just so you know...

26:30.840 --> 26:32.671
l was in it
for the long haul.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.756
It wasn't my fault.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.753
But you still gave
your love away.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.769
I know you want
to do the right thing.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.608
I want out of this life.

26:52.862 --> 26:53.772
My old life.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.861
If you talk to the jury
about what you saw,

26:56.115 --> 26:58.231
just like you talked
to me, you will help

26:58.493 --> 26:59.949
all those victims
The Family preyed on.

27:00.203 --> 27:01.659
You said that
I would be safe!

27:01.913 --> 27:04.029
I don't feel a whole lot
of safe anymore!

27:04.290 --> 27:06.952
Mackenzie,
you are safe.

27:07.210 --> 27:10.043
Ipromised that I wouldn't
let anyone hurt you.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.661
That I would
protect you.

27:11.923 --> 27:12.958
You're leaving me.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.964
I'm not leaving you.
This department--

27:16.219 --> 27:17.834
You made me
believe you.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.710
Because you can.

27:20.223 --> 27:22.305
My boss will take care
of you, Mackenzie.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.547
I swear.

27:27.897 --> 27:29.853
So, how's it going
so far, hero?

27:30.191 --> 27:31.897
Is it everything
you expected?

27:32.235 --> 27:34.066
This is what
I was meant to do.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.732
That's fascinating.
You were meant to do this?

27:36.989 --> 27:38.069
Or did you have to?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.530
Are you trying
to goad me?

27:39.784 --> 27:42.366
We both know how
this is going to end...

27:42.620 --> 27:43.905
...for you.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.363
In the Temple,
time is immaterial.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.742
Aren't you at all curious about
what life you could create here?

27:52.213 --> 27:54.750
Even if it's an illusion.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.555
Chief!
Where is she?

28:04.809 --> 28:06.265
You got her to
cooperate with us.

28:06.519 --> 28:07.975
Then we had
to let her go.

28:08.229 --> 28:10.766
There has to be something
else we can do, I promised!

28:11.023 --> 28:13.435
You'll find another.
They're a dime a dozen.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.647
When are you gonna learn
to play by the rules?

28:16.904 --> 28:18.019
By what rules?

28:18.281 --> 28:19.111
Whose rules?!

28:20.783 --> 28:21.613
She never will be.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.450
We've got a job to do--
if it comes down

28:24.704 --> 28:26.160
to spending money
protecting a street rat,

28:26.414 --> 28:27.529
or one of us...

28:27.790 --> 28:31.203
Then I'm not sure
I want to be "one of us".

28:49.812 --> 28:51.177
Hiya, neighbour!

28:51.439 --> 28:54.021
Great day for a wander.

29:14.837 --> 29:15.542
Hey hon.

29:15.796 --> 29:16.751
How was work?

29:17.757 --> 29:18.621
Don't ask.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.168
Been driving
around all afternoon,

29:20.426 --> 29:22.712
looking for MacKenzie,
my C.|.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.176
You?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.921
Uh, delivered twins, emergency
transfusion for the mom--

29:27.642 --> 29:28.757
Picked up
lndian for dinner.

29:29.018 --> 29:30.679
Ugh--
My hero.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.894
Isee Bitchy Crocker's
been at it again.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.514
Yeah, and don't eat those.
They've got cinnamon in them,

29:36.776 --> 29:38.812
which will react to
your anti-psychotics.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.230
Nerd alert.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.486
Really? Well, I thought
Tamsin was being

29:42.740 --> 29:43.855
awfully neighbourly
to bring them by.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.492
It's funny how
she always seems

29:45.743 --> 29:47.199
to stop by
when I'm at work.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.203
Are you jealous?

29:48.454 --> 29:49.159
Should I be?

29:49.413 --> 29:50.118
Never.

29:50.373 --> 29:51.738
You taking your meds?

29:52.625 --> 29:53.580
Yeah...

29:54.585 --> 29:56.325
But I think
I'm gonna stop.

29:57.630 --> 29:58.585
Bo.

29:58.839 --> 29:59.794
I'm a doctor.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.789
And as you so often say,
an amazing doctor.

30:02.051 --> 30:03.416
Also, sexy.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.585
But I wouldn't have
prescribed them

30:05.846 --> 30:06.710
if you didn't need them.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.635
They do weird
shit to my brain.

30:10.643 --> 30:13.510
Well, your brain did some
really weird shit before.

30:13.771 --> 30:14.851
Do you remember?

30:15.815 --> 30:16.975
Actually...

30:17.858 --> 30:19.189
I don't.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.354
It's my job
to protect you.

30:21.612 --> 30:22.943
You trust me, right?

30:23.197 --> 30:24.152
Yeah.

30:25.366 --> 30:27.482
Well, then you have
nothing to worry about.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.654
We have the perfect life.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.663
I don't ever want it to end.

30:41.424 --> 30:42.379
Whoa, whoa, hey--

30:42.633 --> 30:43.588

31:04.780 --> 31:06.361
Sleep, sweet girl.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.321
You have so much
ahead of you.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.908
I've waited so long
to have you in my arms.

31:35.436 --> 31:38.553
If Isabeau needs anything--
doesn't matter when,

31:38.814 --> 31:42.181
doesn't matter what--
you let me know.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.531
[Gasp!]

31:55.998 --> 31:58.535
He doesn't get
to keep you.

32:13.808 --> 32:16.174
[Laughing]

32:18.104 --> 32:18.763
This is amazing!

32:19.021 --> 32:20.557
I know.
I can't believe it!

32:20.815 --> 32:22.771
Are you sure this
is what you want?

32:23.025 --> 32:25.232
What you
really want, Bo?

32:26.195 --> 32:27.355
Ahh!

32:27.613 --> 32:28.193
Ugh!

32:28.447 --> 32:29.562
Okay, just breathe!
Just--

32:29.824 --> 32:31.360
[Bo panting]

32:31.617 --> 32:32.367
Ugh!

32:32.618 --> 32:34.574
No, I'm--

32:34.829 --> 32:35.944
--not a doctor, |--

32:36.205 --> 32:37.570
What--?

32:37.832 --> 32:38.742
I can't help you, |--

32:38.999 --> 32:40.159
What are you
talking about?

32:40.417 --> 32:41.702
We're too late,
you're devolving!

32:41.961 --> 32:42.950
You're becoming UnderFae!

32:43.212 --> 32:45.168
You said this
wouldn't hurt her!

32:45.756 --> 32:47.371

32:47.633 --> 32:47.962
No, no!

32:48.217 --> 32:49.002
No, I need those!

32:49.260 --> 32:50.420
No, you don't!

32:51.804 --> 32:53.044
You don't need any of this!
None of this is real!

32:53.305 --> 32:54.055
Ah--

32:54.306 --> 32:55.967
That's not--
our baby in your belly!

32:56.225 --> 32:57.590
That's what
you'll become

32:57.852 --> 32:59.808
if you don't get out
of here right now!

33:00.062 --> 33:01.518
[Snarling]

Oh, Dyson--

33:05.526 --> 33:08.484
Bo, Bo, remember--

33:08.988 --> 33:11.730
I'm just a wolf,
standing in front of a--

33:11.991 --> 33:13.151
--in front
of a Succubus.

33:13.409 --> 33:14.364
That's right.

33:14.827 --> 33:15.782
Come on.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.951
We gotta find your key.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.037
Wait, the Caretaker
said that--

33:21.834 --> 33:24.325
When the key
was in hand--

33:26.797 --> 33:28.583
In my Hand.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.673
Only one may leave.

33:32.428 --> 33:33.543
No--

33:33.804 --> 33:34.179
Say it.

33:34.430 --> 33:34.759
No.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.380
Bo.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.972
I am the Key.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.557
No!

33:40.811 --> 33:41.926
No!

33:43.439 --> 33:45.179
If you don't,
we'll both die in here.

33:45.441 --> 33:45.770
Shut up!

33:46.025 --> 33:47.390
Come here!

33:49.403 --> 33:50.609
It's the only way.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.149
There's never
only one way.

33:53.782 --> 33:54.862
Do it.

33:55.409 --> 33:56.524
Now.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.992
Before everyone
loses you forever.

34:00.789 --> 34:04.577
Bo. None of this is real.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.075
Trust me.

have to rip that baby

34:14.970 --> 34:16.130
out of your belly myself.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.295

34:42.206 --> 34:44.037
No, it's not real, right?

34:44.291 --> 34:45.531

It's not real...

No, this isn't
happening--

35:02.977 --> 35:11.942
[Crying]

35:12.194 --> 35:13.855
Didn't think you
had it in you.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.319
Bring him back.

35:15.781 --> 35:16.736
I can't.

35:17.574 --> 35:18.984
But none
of this is real.

35:19.243 --> 35:21.780
Except the part where he
gave up his corporeal life.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.154
When he offered
himself as your "Hand".

35:25.791 --> 35:26.906
Two people may
enter the Temple,

35:27.167 --> 35:29.328
but only one
can leave The Dawning.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.122
I should know.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.666
I came here myself
with someone eons ago,

35:33.924 --> 35:35.039
to help her through.

35:35.301 --> 35:39.260
To regret it now would only
be a judgement on myself.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.759
I also knew
what I was doing.

35:43.017 --> 35:44.132
He knew?

35:44.560 --> 35:45.891
And he's succeeded.

35:46.145 --> 35:48.727
Oh, Dyson--

35:48.981 --> 35:51.643
He is stuck
here forever.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.232
Know how that feels.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.695
Ah... the key.

36:07.207 --> 36:09.368
There you go,
Succubus...

36:09.793 --> 36:11.203

36:13.797 --> 36:15.333

him with you--

36:15.591 --> 36:17.752
--and the Temple will
claim you as its own.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.875
Forever.
Both of you.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.924
Not that I wouldn't
mind the company.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.319
Not without him.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.363
You know that's
against the rules.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.653
See that's the thing--

36:48.582 --> 36:51.415
I've never been
big on rules.

36:52.002 --> 36:54.163
That is who I am.

36:55.172 --> 36:59.006
That--
is my true self.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.151
There's always
another way.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.486
No!

37:22.282 --> 37:23.988
This place
can be vengeful.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.574
You don't know
what will happen--!

37:25.828 --> 37:27.113
Trust me.

37:27.371 --> 37:28.577
He's worth it.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.740
[Energy building]

37:37.589 --> 37:38.749
Trick!

37:39.007 --> 37:39.757
Bo!

37:40.008 --> 37:41.748
Oh God, I need help,
I need help!

37:42.010 --> 37:42.510
What happened?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.467
D-man!

37:45.389 --> 37:48.131
He sacrificed himself
for your victory.

37:49.143 --> 37:51.600
You knew--
Didn't you?

37:52.980 --> 37:53.890
It was his choice.

37:54.148 --> 37:55.934
Oh, no, Trick, no--

37:56.191 --> 37:56.896
No, not like this--

37:57.151 --> 37:57.890
Move, move.

37:58.152 --> 37:58.891
Not like this--

37:59.153 --> 38:01.269
[Crying]
No...

38:02.906 --> 38:04.191
BO: No, this
isn't happening...

38:04.450 --> 38:07.738
This isn't happening,
this isn't happening...

38:07.995 --> 38:14.116
[Crying]

38:14.376 --> 38:16.913
Maybe it's not real.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.929
[Succubus voice]
I will reign...as he did.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.890
For I am his daughter.

38:32.186 --> 38:34.017
Together, we will
bridle the masses,

38:34.271 --> 38:36.136
and ride unto victory.

38:37.024 --> 38:40.061
Even death...
will fear us.

38:41.570 --> 38:54.620
[Energy flowing]

38:54.875 --> 39:00.962
[Coughing]

39:01.215 --> 39:05.549
[Succubus voice]
Only I will choose who lives.

39:11.225 --> 39:13.887
[Energy flowing]

39:14.144 --> 39:15.054
[Gasp!]

39:15.312 --> 39:18.475
[Energy flowing]

39:19.149 --> 39:24.689
[Coughing]

39:29.243 --> 39:30.949
Hey, you...

39:31.203 --> 39:32.283
Hey...

39:33.205 --> 39:35.537
[Laughing]
Hey.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.179
Lauren'll take good
care of Dyson, right?

39:53.642 --> 39:55.428
She is a doctor.

39:55.686 --> 39:56.675
Right.

39:57.813 --> 39:58.928
So...

39:59.606 --> 40:01.187
That was plan B?

40:01.441 --> 40:02.146
Don't worry--

40:02.401 --> 40:04.562
As if I'd let Trick
put you down.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.607
I have seen Old Yeller.
I know what's up.

40:09.241 --> 40:10.777
And if I'd come
out different?

40:11.660 --> 40:12.615
You didn't.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.538
And I'm just--

40:16.456 --> 40:17.912
I'm just so glad
you're back.

40:20.669 --> 40:22.500
I don't know how
I expected to feel.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.006
I didn't expect
to feel so... gooey.

40:25.257 --> 40:26.542
But I've never been
Succubus-kissed before.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.041
Now I know what
the big dealio is.

40:29.303 --> 40:31.760
Well, I had to do it,
to save him.

40:32.014 --> 40:32.969
I know.

40:33.599 --> 40:34.964
And now...

40:35.892 --> 40:37.393
Now, I know
how to control it.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.180
You, my dear,
have evolved.

40:39.438 --> 40:40.644
I am so proud of you.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.103
Thank you.

40:47.237 --> 40:49.614
It's like I understand
something I didn't get before.

40:51.033 --> 40:51.567
I feel...

40:51.825 --> 40:53.781
Like, high?

40:54.036 --> 40:55.196
Yeah.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.534
Kinda.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.580
I think I need
to take a walk.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.369
Alone, if that's okay.

41:02.628 --> 41:05.711
But you still haven't
told me about the kiss.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.003
Mm...

41:08.008 --> 41:09.669
I just need
some time to think.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.541
Of course.

41:19.019 --> 41:21.635
No probs...

41:42.250 --> 41:44.627
That's an amazing
girl you've got there.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.419
I've never seen a
Succubus do what she did.

41:48.674 --> 41:49.629
Thank you.

41:50.217 --> 41:51.832
For everything, Stella.

41:52.636 --> 41:53.546
It's been--

41:53.804 --> 41:54.964
--wonderful.

41:58.725 --> 42:02.343
But there are others
like Bo who need me now.

42:02.604 --> 42:05.846
Unless... you feel
ready for a vacation?

42:07.025 --> 42:09.357
I'm heading to Scotland
for a few months

42:09.611 --> 42:12.523
and I could use a, um--
"Companion".

42:13.532 --> 42:14.942
Bo still needs me.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.567
I'm the only family
she's got left.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.781
I had to do it,
you know--

42:25.043 --> 42:26.579
Offer the human feast--

42:26.837 --> 42:29.203
To give Bo the best
chance I could.

42:29.464 --> 42:31.500
Did you have to be
needlessly cruel to Kenzi?

42:31.758 --> 42:34.215
Everything I said
to that mortal was true.

42:34.511 --> 42:35.671
If you really
cared about her,

42:35.929 --> 42:37.510
you would
tell her yourself.

42:37.764 --> 42:40.881
I understand
if you feel the need to...

42:41.560 --> 42:43.096
...punish me.

42:55.449 --> 42:56.734
I just wonder--

42:57.367 --> 42:59.699
How long you're going
to punish yourself.

43:00.454 --> 43:02.490
Blood King.

43:25.812 --> 43:28.098
Not him...
