01:08.966 --> 01:11.105
So, when are you gonna see the 
turtles again, April ? 

01:11.106 --> 01:13.847
Oh, Irma, give me a break, ok ?

01:13.848 --> 01:15.485
It's not like I can meet them

01:15.486 --> 01:17.124
at times square at high noon.

01:17.125 --> 01:19.230
It's a slow news day, April.

01:19.231 --> 01:22.675
Do you know what good reporters 
do at times like these ?

01:22.676 --> 01:25.149
They take the rest of the day off
and see a movie ?

01:25.150 --> 01:27.390
No. They go out and make news,

01:27.391 --> 01:29.764
which is what I suggest you do.

01:29.765 --> 01:33.409
You're going to see the turtles,
right, April ?

01:33.410 --> 01:36.953
Oh, can I come with you ? Please ?

01:36.954 --> 01:40.865
Irma, the turtles are not the
most exciting thing in my life.

01:40.866 --> 01:43.206
Maybe not in yours,

01:43.207 --> 01:45.881
But they certainly are in mine.

01:45.882 --> 01:48.991
Do you really have to go, master ?

01:48.992 --> 01:52.234
I do not have to. 
I choose to.

01:52.235 --> 01:54.575
Hi, guys ! Anything
exciting happening ?

01:54.576 --> 01:56.983
Like Shredder trying to
take over the world ?

01:56.984 --> 01:59.524
Actually, it's been
kind of quiet, April.

01:59.525 --> 02:01.765
I guess that's why Splinter's going
out of town.

02:01.766 --> 02:03.671
Great ! Is there a story in it ?

02:03.672 --> 02:05.576
I'm afraid not, April.

02:05.577 --> 02:08.151
It's merely an annual
pilgrimage I make.

02:08.152 --> 02:10.693
3 days of fasting and meditation.

02:10.693 --> 02:14.036
Oh, you're right.
That's not much of a story.

02:14.037 --> 02:16.611
Hey, don't sweat it, April.
This is the big city.

02:16.612 --> 02:18.617
Something's bound to happen.

02:18.618 --> 02:20.791
But, Krang, I tell you...

02:20.792 --> 02:26.209
Quiet ! You have let those turtles 
escape for the last time.

02:26.210 --> 02:29.051
The invasion can wait no longer.

02:29.052 --> 02:32.228
One more chance, Krang.
That's all I ask.

02:32.229 --> 02:33.732
Yeah, Krangy.

02:33.733 --> 02:37.979
Just one more chance.
Please ?

02:37.980 --> 02:40.687
Quiet, all of you !

02:40.688 --> 02:43.563
I can see if I want
something done right,

02:43.564 --> 02:45.837
I'll just have to do it myself.

02:45.838 --> 02:48.980
I'm bringing the technodrome
back to earth.

02:48.981 --> 02:52.926
Then I shall personally deal
with the turtles.

02:52.927 --> 02:54.866
All right !
Yeah !

02:54.867 --> 02:57.440
This is gonna be good !

02:57.441 --> 03:00.382
But you'll need power...
enormous power

03:00.383 --> 03:01.955
to open a portal that big.

03:01.956 --> 03:06.235
Precisely. That's why
you are going to take over

03:06.236 --> 03:10.214
the hydroelectric station
at Niagara Falls.

03:10.215 --> 03:14.996
Attach this polarity deflector to
the main control panel.

03:14.997 --> 03:17.103
It will direct the power I need

03:17.104 --> 03:20.045
through the portal to the Technodrome.

03:20.046 --> 03:23.590
Meanwhile, I will move the 
Technodrome

03:23.591 --> 03:26.666
to the proper space-time coordinates.

03:26.667 --> 03:29.040
Krang out.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.481
At last !
My army of foot soldiers

03:31.482 --> 03:34.758
will be mine to command again !

03:34.759 --> 03:37.199
Don't just stand there,
you mutant morons.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.673
We must hurry !

03:39.674 --> 03:42.817
All foot soldiers and rock soldiers...

03:42.818 --> 03:45.459
to your battle stations !

03:51.779 --> 03:54.186
What's going on ?

04:00.039 --> 04:02.913
Krang, i've commandeered
the power station

04:02.914 --> 04:05.790
and the polarity deflector is in place.

04:05.791 --> 04:09.668
For once, you've done
something right.

04:09.669 --> 04:12.577
I'll drain the power from this end.

04:14.417 --> 04:16.790
You brought a turtlecom,
didn't you, master ?

04:16.791 --> 04:20.368
Yes, but contact me
only in dire emergency.

04:20.369 --> 04:22.977
I will return in 3 days.

04:22.978 --> 04:25.183
Farewell, master Splinter.

04:25.184 --> 04:26.689
Yeah. Stay loose.

04:26.690 --> 04:28.928
Boy, good-byes are
really tough for me.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.169
Ok, let's get back to the city.

04:31.170 --> 04:34.079
You never know when
Shredder might strike next.

04:35.851 --> 04:38.960
Fellas, we've got
serious problems !

04:38.961 --> 04:40.866
You had to open your big mouth.

04:40.867 --> 04:42.304
What is it, April ?

04:42.305 --> 04:44.110
There's been a massive 
power failure

04:44.111 --> 04:45.682
throughout the entire city.

04:45.683 --> 04:49.059
Someone or something
is draining the power.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.567
It's the work of Krang and Shredder.

04:51.568 --> 04:53.472
I can sense it.

04:53.473 --> 04:58.355
Bud ! I thought only Splinter could
do that psychic bit.

04:58.356 --> 05:01.030
Well, with him away,
someone has to do it.

05:01.031 --> 05:02.368
We'll head back immediately.

05:02.369 --> 05:05.745
Yeah ! Let's show those creepozoids

05:05.746 --> 05:08.219
What turtle power is all about !

05:11.130 --> 05:15.643
Yes ! Yes !
It's working !

05:15.644 --> 05:18.719
The capacitators are charging.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.196
Shredder, the turtles will
certainly learn of this

05:22.197 --> 05:24.002
And try to stop you.

05:24.003 --> 05:26.477
That's why i'm sending you
a contingent

05:26.478 --> 05:29.085
of foot soldiers and rock soldiers.

05:29.086 --> 05:32.162
Oh, at last !
You won't regret this, Krang.

05:32.163 --> 05:34.268
I'd better not.

05:34.269 --> 05:36.910
Prepare to enter the portal.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.553
At last, i have my army !

05:50.554 --> 05:54.599
I'd like to see the turtles
try something now. 

05:54.600 --> 05:57.675
Now, to coordinate our attack.

05:57.676 --> 06:00.584
Shredder calling Krang.
Come in, Krang.

06:01.656 --> 06:04.096
What do you think
caused this blackout ?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.235
I'll bet my shell it's Shredder.

06:06.236 --> 06:08.877
Yeah ! My thoughts exactamundo.

06:08.878 --> 06:11.553
If I can just tune in the right 
frequency...

06:11.554 --> 06:14.629
Shredder calling Krang.
Come in, Krang.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.902
Krang here.
What is it ?

06:16.903 --> 06:20.982
The foot soldiers and rock soldiers
have arrived.

06:20.983 --> 06:22.153
Good.

06:22.154 --> 06:24.928
The technodrome is almost
fully charged.

06:24.929 --> 06:27.536
Estimate portal penetration

06:27.537 --> 06:30.346
in approximately half a...

06:30.347 --> 06:32.184
What's he saying ?

06:32.185 --> 06:33.455
I can't make it out.

06:33.456 --> 06:36.565
Something about Krang using
the Niagara power station

06:36.566 --> 06:39.374
to open a portal large enough
for the Technodrome.

06:39.375 --> 06:43.554
The Technodrome ?
Megadisaster !

06:43.555 --> 06:45.158
We've got to stop it.

06:45.159 --> 06:47.700
We're the only hope the world has.

06:47.701 --> 06:50.375
Turtle power !

06:50.376 --> 06:53.719
It's hard to say no to a guy like that.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.023
Wait for me, guys !

06:55.024 --> 06:57.664
This could be the story of the century.

07:00.207 --> 07:01.544
Do you think maybe

07:01.545 --> 07:03.884
we ought to tell Splinter about this ?

07:03.885 --> 07:06.493
It sure fits my description
of an emergency.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.566
We can't keep running
to Splinter for help.

07:08.567 --> 07:12.311
He trained us for this.
We must not fail him.

07:16.124 --> 07:19.299
I sense a great danger approaching

07:19.300 --> 07:21.407
somewhere to the south of here.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.744
I must hurry.

07:25.018 --> 07:27.860
It will all go splendidly.

07:27.861 --> 07:30.435
Prepare to enter the portal.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.648
It doesn't look good.

07:34.649 --> 07:37.390
Shredder's got a small army
patrolling the area.

07:37.391 --> 07:41.703
Well, well.
Look at who's here.

07:41.704 --> 07:44.312
Adios, shell bats.

07:46.620 --> 07:50.029
Cowabunga !

07:52.606 --> 07:55.580
Safe landing.
No need to panic.

07:55.581 --> 07:57.788
You want to bet ?

08:06.751 --> 08:10.862
And I always thought Niagara Falls
was a romantic place.

08:10.863 --> 08:12.836
If we're gonna go over the falls,

08:12.837 --> 08:14.440
we should at least do it in a barrel !

08:14.441 --> 08:17.249
Like, somebody do something,

08:17.250 --> 08:20.124
or we're gonna be turtles
on the half-shell !

08:20.125 --> 08:22.465
There's still one slight chance

08:22.466 --> 08:26.110
if the laser blast didn't damage 
the remote control functions.

08:26.111 --> 08:27.916
It's working.

08:27.917 --> 08:30.758
Oh, so tubuloso !

08:30.759 --> 08:34.135
I hate to be a bother,
but can't you hurry it up ?!

08:34.136 --> 08:36.644
Give me a break.
This is delicate work.

08:38.149 --> 08:39.318
Jump for it !

08:41.760 --> 08:43.933
Nice, Donatello.

08:43.934 --> 08:46.274
Next time you think you could 
shave it a little closer ?

08:46.275 --> 08:47.511
What do you mean ?

08:47.512 --> 08:49.818
We had two whole seconds to spare.

08:52.026 --> 08:54.935
Well, so far we've managed
to lose the glider

08:54.936 --> 08:56.874
and nearly get ourselves killed.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.546
Turtles !

08:58.547 --> 09:01.656
Master splinter !
What are you doing here ?

09:01.657 --> 09:03.997
That drew me here.

09:03.998 --> 09:07.909
Mondo misery
To the max !

09:07.910 --> 09:10.550
I hate to say this,
But we're in deep trouble.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.259
He's preparing to return
The technodrome to earth.

09:13.260 --> 09:16.001
We've got to cut off
The power to the portal.

09:16.002 --> 09:20.816
Outstanding plan, dude.
Any idea as to how ?

09:20.817 --> 09:22.890
Well, if we could
Somehow stop the river

09:22.891 --> 09:24.929
That would shut down
The power station.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.939
Swell. We'll just round up
50 million beavers

09:27.940 --> 09:30.145
And ask them
To please build us a dam.

09:30.146 --> 09:32.587
Not bad, but i've got
A better idea.

09:32.588 --> 09:34.626
Listen. If we can just...

09:36.801 --> 09:39.676
Preparing
Antigravity points.

09:43.957 --> 09:47.835
You're convinced
This is going to work,
Right, donatello ?

09:47.836 --> 09:49.975
It should. Most of
The river is diverted

09:49.976 --> 09:52.149
Through tunnels
To the power station.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.021
All we have to do
Is close them off.

09:54.022 --> 09:55.827
As simple
As that, huh ?

09:55.828 --> 09:57.866
I suppose you've got
A better suggestion ?

09:57.867 --> 09:59.572
I do.

10:03.987 --> 10:05.992
Hi, fellas.

10:12.347 --> 10:14.017
Surprise !

10:16.459 --> 10:19.970
So much for that idea.

10:21.610 --> 10:23.748
Chill out, donatello.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.032
Double trouble.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.503
Hey, you !

10:40.535 --> 10:42.641
Thanks for
The help, april.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.547
I wonder how
The others are doing.

10:44.548 --> 10:46.821
Well, there's
One way to find out.

10:46.822 --> 10:51.336
The other soldiers
Should have been
Back by now.

10:51.337 --> 10:53.609
What could have
Happened to 'em ?

10:53.610 --> 10:55.682
We happened,
Rocksteady.

10:59.428 --> 11:00.565
What ?

11:00.566 --> 11:02.872
Had enough ?

11:02.873 --> 11:07.955
Me ? You're about
To get plasmerized.

11:10.798 --> 11:14.977
Ooh, you guys are
Starting to get my goat !

11:16.984 --> 11:22.768
Hey !
What's...going...on ?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.811
Thanks for the help,
Master splinter.

11:25.812 --> 11:27.817
Yeah ! You really
Dusted him off.

11:27.818 --> 11:29.322
We must hurry.

11:29.323 --> 11:32.866
The sleep spice
Will not affect one
His size for long.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.638
You guys have
Any trouble ?

11:34.639 --> 11:36.211
No. Piece of cake.

11:36.212 --> 11:39.554
Ok, donatello,
Shut this thing
Down.

11:39.555 --> 11:40.724
I'll try.

11:45.173 --> 11:48.750
The power's gone !
But that's impossible !

11:50.523 --> 11:54.535
No ! This can't be
Happening !

11:54.536 --> 11:56.909
Krang, the power
Has been cut off !

11:56.910 --> 11:59.082
I can see that, fool.

11:59.083 --> 12:03.129
I'm diverting
Auxiliary power
To the portal.

12:05.571 --> 12:07.743
They must have
Shut off the pumps.

12:07.744 --> 12:11.354
Follow me with
As many soldiers
As you can find.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.661
Sure thing, boss.

12:13.662 --> 12:16.938
Hey, it worked !
Yipe !

12:16.939 --> 12:18.510
Don't look now,
Guys,

12:18.511 --> 12:20.450
But i think
They figured out
Our plan.

12:20.451 --> 12:23.560
Then we go out with
Turtle honor, fighting.

12:23.561 --> 12:26.636
Yeah ? I'd rather go out
For pizza, biting.

12:26.637 --> 12:28.441
Well, look at
The bright side.

12:28.442 --> 12:30.047
Things could be worse.

12:30.048 --> 12:33.056
I got news.
Things are worse !

12:33.057 --> 12:36.901
Flaming ravioli !
It's the technodrome !

12:41.015 --> 12:45.529
My enemies the turtles
About to be crushed

12:45.530 --> 12:48.706
Into amphibious particles !

12:48.707 --> 12:52.317
What a truly
Pleasant moment.

12:56.431 --> 12:58.236
What do we do now ?

12:58.237 --> 13:00.910
Well, we can always pray
For a meteor to strike.

13:00.911 --> 13:04.087
Troops, attack !

13:04.088 --> 13:08.000
No ! This is not how
I wish it to end.

13:08.001 --> 13:11.176
Stop ! Leave them to me !

13:11.177 --> 13:15.524
I want the pleasure of
Destroying them myself.

13:19.203 --> 13:21.442
Guys, it looks like
We're headed

13:21.443 --> 13:23.983
For that big pet shop
In the sky.

13:28.566 --> 13:30.872
Well, it's been nice
Knowing you guys.

13:30.873 --> 13:32.711
And you, too, april.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.788
Oh, right.
A real thrill.

13:35.789 --> 13:37.927
Do not despair, donatello.

13:37.928 --> 13:40.134
In life,
There is always hope.

13:42.041 --> 13:44.616
Well, my hope is
That you're right !

13:44.617 --> 13:49.297
I bid you farewell,
Mutants.

13:49.298 --> 13:51.871
What ?

13:54.146 --> 13:56.152
Something's gone wrong.

13:56.153 --> 13:58.559
I've used
Too much power

13:58.560 --> 14:00.565
In keeping
The portal open.

14:00.566 --> 14:03.141
The capacitators
Are drained.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.548
Turtle power !

14:08.325 --> 14:10.330
Stop them,
My foot soldiers !

14:10.331 --> 14:11.901
They must not escape !

14:15.447 --> 14:19.525
Exactly the way
You planned it,
Right, leonardo ?

14:19.526 --> 14:22.534
Well, i never
Look a gift branch
In the mouth.

14:22.535 --> 14:25.310
Hey, if we don't get away,
We're turtle toe jam.

14:25.311 --> 14:26.714
Like, how, man ?

14:26.715 --> 14:29.824
This place
Is crawling
With creepolas.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.697
Watch and learn.

14:36.246 --> 14:39.790
Keep shooting,
You rock-brained morons !

14:39.791 --> 14:41.729
They're getting away !

14:43.869 --> 14:46.243
They've escaped again !

14:46.244 --> 14:48.784
Oh, this is getting
Very monotonous.

14:48.785 --> 14:52.362
They won't get far.
Reactivate the falls

14:52.363 --> 14:55.338
While i recharge
The capacitators.

14:55.339 --> 14:58.415
As you said earlier,
This had better work.

14:58.416 --> 14:59.919
I hate to say it,

14:59.920 --> 15:02.728
But with the technodrome
In krang's power,

15:02.729 --> 15:05.237
We've got our shells
To the wall.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.647
Master, we must
Make plans to defeat
Krang and shredder.

15:08.648 --> 15:10.553
Unfortunately,
We can do little

15:10.554 --> 15:12.325
Until we learn
Their plan.

15:12.326 --> 15:16.171
And by then,
It might be
Too late.

15:16.172 --> 15:19.715
Splendid !
We're at full power again.

15:19.716 --> 15:23.494
Now, to implement
My ingenious plan.

15:23.495 --> 15:24.998
Which is ?

15:24.999 --> 15:29.613
To create a seismic
Vibration so intense

15:29.614 --> 15:31.687
As to cause
An earthquake

15:31.688 --> 15:34.228
Of cataclysmic
Proportions.

15:34.229 --> 15:37.906
Then take over
The evacuated city

15:37.907 --> 15:40.481
And make it
Our base of operations.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.888
From there,
We will use

15:42.889 --> 15:45.229
The capabilities
Of dimension x

15:45.230 --> 15:48.406
To conquer
The entire planet.

15:48.407 --> 15:51.650
I like it.
I like it.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.893
Do you really
Have any choice ?

16:02.217 --> 16:04.021
What's happening ?

16:04.022 --> 16:08.302
This is krang,
Ruler of dimension x.

16:08.303 --> 16:11.144
I...i command everyone

16:11.145 --> 16:14.288
To leave the city
Immediately.

16:14.289 --> 16:18.568
If it is not evacuated
In 24 hours,

16:18.569 --> 16:21.678
I shall cause
A much stronger quake

16:21.679 --> 16:24.653
And level every building.

16:24.654 --> 16:26.659
Can he do that ?

16:26.660 --> 16:29.168
I'm afraid
The answer is yes.

16:29.169 --> 16:31.842
We've got to find
The technodrome
And stop him !

16:31.843 --> 16:33.348
Sure, no sweat !

16:33.349 --> 16:36.424
And what'll we do
With the rest
Of the afternoon ?

16:36.425 --> 16:39.099
Enough talking.
It's time for action.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.273
Turtles, follow me.

16:41.274 --> 16:45.185
And so begins
The final battle.

16:45.186 --> 16:47.693
If we keep
Following this trail
The technodrome left,

16:47.694 --> 16:49.364
We're sure to find it.

16:49.365 --> 16:50.870
It's kind of
Hard to miss.

16:50.871 --> 16:53.311
It's only
5 times the size of
The houston astrodome.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.785
Look ! There's
Something up ahead.

16:55.786 --> 17:00.166
The technodrome.
We found it !

17:00.167 --> 17:03.710
I keep forgetting
How humongous it is.

17:03.711 --> 17:06.084
Ok, so how do we get inside ?

17:06.085 --> 17:08.090
It won't be easy.
The whole thing

17:08.092 --> 17:10.565
Is covered
With foot-thick
Titanium armor.

17:10.566 --> 17:12.939
Hey, don't sweat it.
I've got this gadget

17:12.940 --> 17:16.116
I've been saving for
Just such an occasion.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.290
Now what ?

17:18.290 --> 17:19.794
Right.
Everyone take cover.

17:19.795 --> 17:23.171
This explosive packs
An incredible punch.

17:26.082 --> 17:27.685
You call that a punch ?

17:27.686 --> 17:29.625
It's more like
A slap on the wrist.

17:29.626 --> 17:32.167
Well, sometimes they need
A little adjustment.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.881
And sometimes not.

17:36.882 --> 17:38.621
Let's go !

17:40.393 --> 17:44.706
Security has been breached
On level seven !

17:44.707 --> 17:47.247
It must be
Those blasted
Turtles again !

17:47.248 --> 17:49.053
Do we know
Where we're going ?

17:49.054 --> 17:50.524
Or are we just
Sightseeing ?

17:50.525 --> 17:52.798
If i can locate
The control circuits

17:52.799 --> 17:55.273
I can deactivate
The earthquake-
Causing mechanism.

17:55.274 --> 17:56.778
Stop !

17:56.779 --> 17:58.617
Is anything wrong,
Master splinter ?

17:58.618 --> 18:01.894
Shredder is drawing close.
I can sense him.

18:01.895 --> 18:05.104
I will lead him away
So that you may continue
Your search.

18:07.914 --> 18:10.253
You clumsy idiots !

18:10.254 --> 18:12.929
Well, why'd
You stop, boss ?

18:12.930 --> 18:18.112
I sense that
My ancient enemy,
Hamato yoshi, is nearby.

18:18.113 --> 18:20.251
I shall deal
With him personally.

18:20.252 --> 18:23.394
You two find the turtles
And finish them.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.435
With pleasure, boss.

18:25.436 --> 18:28.779
Yeah. Just
Leave it to us.

18:29.849 --> 18:32.490
What luck !
We located it.

18:32.491 --> 18:34.964
Now, if i can
Just rewire them...

18:34.965 --> 18:37.974
Hurry, donatello.
We're running out of time.

18:37.975 --> 18:40.817
Wrong,
Turtle breath.

18:40.818 --> 18:43.625
Your time
Just ran out.

18:52.721 --> 18:55.763
So, hamato yoshi...

18:55.764 --> 18:59.943
It appears it is time for
Our final confrontation.

18:59.944 --> 19:03.287
Hamato yoshi
Is no longer.

19:03.288 --> 19:05.026
There is only splinter.

19:05.027 --> 19:11.915
And soon he will be
Gone as well.

19:11.916 --> 19:14.690
Wait ! You can't fire
Your lasers in here.

19:14.691 --> 19:16.529
You'll damage the circuitry.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.371
Uh, he's right.
Huh ?

19:19.372 --> 19:22.548
I guess
We just got to do this
The old-fashioned way.

19:22.549 --> 19:25.022
Ain't that a shame.

19:26.093 --> 19:27.531
Got you !

19:34.620 --> 19:36.994
Watch out !
Ow !

19:36.995 --> 19:39.769
Did you have time
To shut down the circuits ?

19:39.770 --> 19:42.276
I sure hope so.
We'll find out

19:42.277 --> 19:44.417
When krang tries to cause
Another earthquake.

19:44.418 --> 19:48.195
One of these days

19:48.196 --> 19:52.075
Those turtles are
Really going to get it.

19:52.076 --> 19:56.488
So, those foolish citizens
Refuse to evacuate.

19:56.489 --> 19:59.498
Then it's time to
Really shake them up.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.337
Wha...

20:01.338 --> 20:04.915
Now something's wrong
With the drill mechanism.

20:22.271 --> 20:25.045
Curse you !

20:27.354 --> 20:30.061
Something tells me
This is the grand finale.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.301
I'm sure glad
We got good seats.

20:32.302 --> 20:35.511
Hey ! Like, we forgot
All about splinter !

20:35.512 --> 20:37.986
Oh ! He's still in
The technodrome.

20:44.006 --> 20:45.945
All right !
He made it !

20:45.946 --> 20:48.720
Let's haul shell.
That thing's about

20:48.721 --> 20:50.559
To drill straight down
To the earth's core.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.003
Someone has reversed
The seismic polarities !

20:54.004 --> 20:56.444
The technodrome
Is sinking,

20:56.445 --> 21:00.457
And i'm powerless
To stop it !

21:00.458 --> 21:05.573
Shredder !
This is all your fault !

21:05.574 --> 21:09.786
I'll get you for this !

21:09.787 --> 21:12.729
Well, we finally put an end

21:12.730 --> 21:16.040
to Krang and Shredder's
evil plans for world domination.

21:16.041 --> 21:20.520
Yeah, dudes.
Time to party hearty !

21:20.521 --> 21:23.663
What a story !
And the remarkable thing is,

21:23.664 --> 21:27.943
they were defeated by
4 half-teenagers and half-turtles.

21:27.944 --> 21:31.455
And let's not forget one half-man
and half-rat, huh ?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.628
I just realized something.

21:33.629 --> 21:37.474
I'm the only 100% human being
in this place.

21:37.475 --> 21:41.720
Well, don't feel bad, April.
Nobody's perfect.
