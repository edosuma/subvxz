WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:03.352
Previously on The Last Man On Earth...

00:03.378 --> 00:05.480
I came across some murdered corpses

00:05.505 --> 00:06.671
hidden in our walls.

00:06.767 --> 00:08.500
The chances of that blob being people

00:08.594 --> 00:10.304
are almost nonexistent.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.409
Let's go.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.213
Home, sweet...

00:16.315 --> 00:17.349
We're moving.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.319
Wh-What do you mean we're moving?

00:21.421 --> 00:22.587
The house is filled with dead bodies

00:22.689 --> 00:24.131
sealed up in the walls.

00:24.156 --> 00:26.911
It's like a gingerbread
house made of corpses, bud.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.743
And guns! All over the place.

00:28.846 --> 00:30.419
You'd swear we were still in America.

00:30.444 --> 00:33.782
Oh! Looks like you
guys missed a spot here.

00:35.597 --> 00:38.017
Well, how was your trip?
Did you find any people?

00:38.117 --> 00:39.272
Hate to say it, Care Bear,

00:39.297 --> 00:42.891
but we're all still fighting
a raging case of HPV...

00:42.993 --> 00:45.724
- Human People Vanished.
- And of course,

00:45.749 --> 00:47.963
Phil is still battling the more
traditional strain as well...

00:48.065 --> 00:51.860
- And-and winning! And-and winning. 
- Sure. Oh, hey!

00:51.885 --> 00:54.419
We did bring you guys back
some horny little souvenirs.

00:54.725 --> 00:56.127
You're gonna love this.

00:57.690 --> 01:00.491
Ta-da!

01:01.761 --> 01:03.661
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- Whoa, hey! Hey!

01:03.763 --> 01:06.564
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Stop! Get back here! Halt!

01:08.401 --> 01:09.434
Idiot.

01:09.509 --> 01:12.020
- We'll get them later.
- Kids, am I right?

01:13.285 --> 01:16.774
Well, guess it's time we
say our final good-byes.

01:21.091 --> 01:24.025
♪ Our house ♪

01:24.042 --> 01:25.625
♪ In the middle ♪

01:25.650 --> 01:26.798
♪ Of our ♪

01:26.823 --> 01:30.365
♪ Street... ♪

01:31.469 --> 01:35.616
Today we say adios to
a very special casa.

01:36.009 --> 01:38.282
It hasn't been this hard
to say good-bye to a house

01:38.307 --> 01:41.602
since Hugh Laurie died, but we must.

01:41.795 --> 01:43.210
So many memories.

01:43.312 --> 01:46.246
Where our babies saw
their first piano explode.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.416
Where Todd's yeoman-like
self-pleasuring

01:49.518 --> 01:53.287
put another baby in the Dundee pouch.

01:53.389 --> 01:56.223
Where Gail propositioned me to have sex

01:56.325 --> 01:59.226
and was furious when I called her on it.

01:59.328 --> 02:03.063
And where I taught an old
dog the greatest trick of all,

02:03.165 --> 02:05.365
how to roll over and play alive.

02:06.878 --> 02:10.237
And so we lay to rest the brave souls

02:10.339 --> 02:14.208
who insulated our walls
lo these many months.

02:14.612 --> 02:18.565
Melissa will now honor
them with a 21-gun salute.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.204
- That was about 21.
- That was beautiful.

02:28.383 --> 02:31.479
And as we move on to
our new home in Cancun...

02:31.520 --> 02:32.596
Hoo-dee!

02:32.621 --> 02:35.555
A controversial suggestion
from an unnamed source...

02:35.657 --> 02:38.055
- Proud of it.
- who pressured us relentlessly

02:38.075 --> 02:40.075
until we bent to his or her whims

02:40.177 --> 02:41.443
like the jellyfish we are...

02:41.545 --> 02:45.213
- Yeah, you did.
- We bid our final "hasta la vista, baby"

02:45.315 --> 02:47.282
to this place that meant so much

02:47.384 --> 02:51.053
until it turned into a
raging carnival of horrors.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.595
And now,

02:52.697 --> 02:55.698
we send it back to Hell,
from whence it came.

02:56.451 --> 02:58.051
Beelzebub,

02:58.076 --> 03:01.668
take this house and
shove it in your butt.

03:02.134 --> 03:03.828
Now stand back, everyone.

03:03.853 --> 03:05.953
I packed a lot of charge in there.

03:06.544 --> 03:09.245
It's a remote control
thing for explosives.

03:09.347 --> 03:10.513
Okay, now.

03:11.228 --> 03:12.808
Goggles?

03:14.111 --> 03:15.177
Un-soft hats?

03:17.654 --> 03:18.686
Here we go.

03:21.485 --> 03:25.869
Three... two... one...

03:25.894 --> 03:27.194
Hold on, Tandy, wait!

03:30.394 --> 03:32.261
Cancun, baby!

03:34.065 --> 03:35.164
So we're really doing this?

03:35.266 --> 03:37.266
I mean, we're just gonna
leave Jasper behind?

03:37.368 --> 03:40.035
I left him a self-driving car
with coordinates to Cancun.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.653
I mean, if he wants to come, he'll come.

03:41.678 --> 03:43.482
Yeah, you're doing the right thing.

03:44.302 --> 03:46.202
What's going on there?

03:46.227 --> 03:48.077
- What?
- With the...

03:48.527 --> 03:50.453
- Oh, this?
- Yeah.

03:50.478 --> 03:53.490
As you know, being pregnant
really takes its toll

03:53.764 --> 03:54.945
on the female body.

03:54.970 --> 03:57.325
In my case, my sleep apnea

03:57.350 --> 04:00.923
has now blossomed into
full-blown day apnea.

04:01.025 --> 04:02.057
And-and the sunglasses?

04:02.159 --> 04:03.763
Well, to be honest,

04:03.788 --> 04:06.261
I'm a little self-conscious
about the mask,

04:06.356 --> 04:10.501
so I thought the sunglasses
might up my cool factor.

04:11.128 --> 04:12.294
Is it working?

04:13.621 --> 04:15.971
- Totally.
- Very... yeah, very cool.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.656
You sure you don't
want to take your truck?

04:18.680 --> 04:21.343
No, I'm good.

04:22.541 --> 04:24.603
She already did her job, you know?

04:26.136 --> 04:27.843
She brought me back to my brother.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.286
Plus, the cab is literally
soaked in goat piss.

04:31.662 --> 04:34.990
Oh, uh, that reminds me, I
brought you a little lemonade.

04:35.092 --> 04:36.992
Why did goat... make
you think of lemonade?

04:39.430 --> 04:40.929
Why is it in a vase?

04:41.038 --> 04:42.972
Uh...

04:43.067 --> 04:44.366
And why's there so little of it, too?

04:44.468 --> 04:46.961
- It's just this small amount.
- It's really a simple question.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.826
- Do you want some lemonade or not?
- Nah, I'm good.

04:48.851 --> 04:50.004
So what's the plan?

04:50.244 --> 04:53.108
Drive out to Tapachula,
grab as many goats as we can,

04:53.210 --> 04:55.212
then bust ass for Cankizzy.

04:55.237 --> 04:56.311
How are we gonna get everyone there?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.498
Should we go pick up
an R.V. or something?

04:58.523 --> 05:01.316
I was thinking more along
the lines of an S.E....

05:02.109 --> 05:04.119
Something else.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.221
All aboard!

05:06.323 --> 05:08.891
Next stop, Tapachula!

05:12.196 --> 05:13.862
Cancun, baby!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.712
Well, Andy,

05:20.737 --> 05:23.771
it's still hard saying
good-bye to Zihuatanejo.

05:23.806 --> 05:25.101
Well, Red,

05:25.126 --> 05:26.255
get busy living...

05:26.368 --> 05:28.501
Or get busy dying.

05:29.153 --> 05:31.431
Well, I guess it's
time for me to move on

05:31.456 --> 05:35.358
to the next movie in
my filmography, Seven.

05:35.393 --> 05:36.793
Will you join me, Brad Pitt?

05:36.828 --> 05:40.496
What's in the box? What's in the box?!

05:40.532 --> 05:42.098
Ah...

05:42.667 --> 05:45.702
Hey, couldn't help notice
you guys Frenching over here,

05:45.737 --> 05:47.986
and I love it. You know,
glad you guys are enjoying

05:48.011 --> 05:49.143
each other's mouths.

05:49.168 --> 05:50.377
- What do you want, Tandy?
- Look.

05:50.402 --> 05:52.402
I feel like Mike is
still a little bit lonely,

05:52.744 --> 05:54.084
so I think it might be nice

05:54.145 --> 05:56.345
if we, you know, keep
the PDA to a minimum.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.280
I mean, for instance,
Carol and I have decided

05:58.315 --> 05:59.853
that every time we want to kiss,

05:59.878 --> 06:01.873
we're just gonna shake hands instead.

06:01.898 --> 06:03.218
It's actually been pretty erotic.

06:03.254 --> 06:06.121
After all, the, you know, the
palm is the vagina of the hand.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.123
- No, it's not.
- So, uh, what do you say?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.769
- Copy that, bud.
- Thanks, bud. Friendship kiss?

06:10.794 --> 06:13.372
- Of course.
- Great.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.464
That was a test. You failed it.

06:18.998 --> 06:21.270
Son of a gun.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.176
Well, the last time I was on a train,

06:27.211 --> 06:31.101
I was smuggling a duffel bag
full of endangered turtles,

06:32.049 --> 06:33.348
but this is pretty nice.

06:34.748 --> 06:37.219
Is this all the food we brought?

06:37.254 --> 06:40.489
Mango chutney and a pie shell?

06:40.524 --> 06:43.158
That's the only stuff in the
house that wasn't expired.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.226
Oh, don't worry.

06:44.261 --> 06:47.324
According to Tandy
and Mike, 13 more hours

06:47.349 --> 06:49.550
and we'll be swimming in goat meat.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.790
Looks like we've been "goats-ted."

06:54.830 --> 06:57.506
I don't get it. They were right here.

06:57.541 --> 07:00.122
Oh, my God. Are those avocado trees?

07:00.147 --> 07:02.077
Look at all these orange trees.

07:02.112 --> 07:03.979
Well, I'd say they're
mostly green and brown,

07:04.014 --> 07:06.122
but they do have the
fruit oranges on them.

07:06.147 --> 07:07.160
Idiot.

07:07.185 --> 07:09.284
Hey, uh, why don't you
guys stick around here,

07:09.320 --> 07:12.120
and, uh, Phil and I will go
look for the goats, all right?

07:12.156 --> 07:14.022
Hey, Todd, do you know
how to build a fire?

07:14.051 --> 07:17.126
Yeah, no problem. We, uh,
we have any oven mitts?

07:18.886 --> 07:20.128
I'll do it.

07:20.438 --> 07:21.997
Okay.

07:22.032 --> 07:25.100
- Well, be back soon.
- Oh.

of getting freaky,

07:56.852 --> 07:58.581
you and Carol can totally
kiss in front of me.

07:58.606 --> 08:00.168
- It doesn't bother me.
- Oh.

08:00.204 --> 08:02.841
You know, I just didn't want
to make you uncomfortable.

08:02.866 --> 08:04.817
I know you've been
feeling a little lonely.

08:05.937 --> 08:07.097
Phil...

08:08.904 --> 08:10.044
I'm fine.

08:11.015 --> 08:13.015
- Yeah?
- Okay. Okay.

08:13.344 --> 08:15.017
Mind if we pick up the pace
here a little bit, though?

08:15.052 --> 08:17.664
Oh, sorry. Clancy kind of marches

08:17.689 --> 08:19.187
to the beat of his own drum.

08:20.049 --> 08:22.024
So what's the story
with this thing, anyway?

08:22.229 --> 08:23.504
I don't know.

08:23.529 --> 08:25.193
I missed having a dog.

08:25.509 --> 08:27.062
And this is working for you?

08:27.087 --> 08:30.072
Oh, yeah, Clancy is
great, yeah. Watch this.

08:30.107 --> 08:32.361
Clancy, fetch!

08:33.037 --> 08:34.068
Okay, come on.

08:35.821 --> 08:37.405
There you go. Good approach.

08:37.744 --> 08:40.142
Head down. Come on. There you go.

08:40.203 --> 08:41.302
Okay, now pick it up.

08:43.091 --> 08:45.113
You should know from experience
this would work a lot better

08:45.149 --> 08:46.515
if you rubbed a little
peanut butter on it.

08:46.540 --> 08:49.284
Mike, that is so aggressively wack.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.119
- What?
- Okay, that was one time.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.358
Hey, hey. Check it out.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.611
What?

08:56.938 --> 08:59.094
Oh, my God.

09:07.716 --> 09:10.372
Kind of reminds me of Grandma's.

09:11.566 --> 09:13.299
All right, come on. Let's go.

09:13.405 --> 09:14.505
Okay.

09:25.089 --> 09:27.122
Incredible, Carol.

09:27.157 --> 09:30.058
I mean, I'd order this
in a sit-down restaurant.

09:30.094 --> 09:32.361
Ah, look at you gals
getting your feast on.

09:32.396 --> 09:35.063
Carol has really outdone herself.

09:35.099 --> 09:36.231
You see any goats out there?

09:36.266 --> 09:37.990
Uh, unfortunately, no.

09:38.015 --> 09:39.872
But we did see a pretty cool house.

09:39.897 --> 09:40.930
You know, it could come in handy

09:40.955 --> 09:43.238
if we need to stay here
longer than expected.

09:43.273 --> 09:44.692
Okay, hold up. Just how
long are we gonna wait

09:44.717 --> 09:45.340
for these goats, anyway?

09:45.376 --> 09:47.109
Yeah, we need to make a plan.

09:47.144 --> 09:49.698
The plan is we stay
for as long as it takes.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.346
I mean, this could be a food source

09:51.382 --> 09:53.541
that could last us
the rest of our lives.

09:53.823 --> 09:58.197
Goat milk, goat cheese,
goat yogurt, goat, uh, eggs.

09:58.801 --> 10:01.256
What's the harm in waiting
around a few more days?

10:01.291 --> 10:03.058
This is a pretty pleasant place.

10:03.657 --> 10:07.006
Fine, but I'm not waiting around
forever for billy goat cheese.

10:07.031 --> 10:08.130
Yeah, that's right.

10:08.165 --> 10:09.781
Yeah, what if they never come back?

10:09.806 --> 10:11.544
You got this long.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.239
Ticktock.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.453
Hey, can't sleep?

10:32.235 --> 10:34.409
Yeah, me, neither.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.293
Want to take a little walk?

11:26.833 --> 11:29.920
Oh. Hey, Clancy, fetch.

11:30.039 --> 11:31.486
Fetch.

12:11.659 --> 12:14.089
What the hell?

12:14.546 --> 12:16.491
Hey there, little turkey.

12:17.399 --> 12:20.050
Hey. Hey, don't be afraid.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.230
Hey. Hey, don't be afraid.

12:22.266 --> 12:24.099
Come here. Come here.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.334
No, no, no! Where are you going?

12:26.715 --> 12:28.303
Hey! Come back!

12:31.990 --> 12:33.141
Tandy!

12:33.177 --> 12:35.076
The goats! They came back!

12:35.511 --> 12:37.544
Cancun, baby.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.796
Looks like that just about does it.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.476
You ready to leave, Boogersleeve?

12:52.359 --> 12:54.597
Cancun, baby!

13:19.924 --> 13:23.859
Phil.

13:23.961 --> 13:25.728
Look.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.076
- Hey, why are we stopping?
- That was that little dog

13:32.178 --> 13:34.037
- you were talking about.
- Yeah.

13:34.062 --> 13:35.346
Hey, little guy!

13:36.899 --> 13:39.132
You want to go to Cancun with us?

13:40.142 --> 13:41.968
Hey, come here!

13:42.351 --> 13:43.752
Well, I guess he wants to stay here.

13:43.777 --> 13:44.838
- What's going on?
- Cancun, baby!

13:44.940 --> 13:45.839
Come on!

13:45.941 --> 13:47.974
Cancun! Cancun!

13:48.076 --> 13:50.333
- Cancun! Cancun!
- All right, Phil. Come on.

13:50.358 --> 13:51.845
- Let's do it.
- Cancun! Cancun!

13:51.947 --> 13:56.116
Cancun! Cancun! Cancun!

13:56.218 --> 13:58.051
Cancun! Cancun!

13:58.153 --> 14:01.087
- Cancun! Cancun!
- What's up, bud?

14:01.190 --> 14:04.090
Cancun! Cancun! Cancun!

14:04.193 --> 14:08.028
- Cancun! Cancun!
- Phil?

14:08.130 --> 14:10.374
Cancun! Cancun!

14:10.399 --> 14:12.332
What the hell?

14:17.918 --> 14:19.387
What the hell you doing, Phil?

14:19.412 --> 14:21.427
Oh, my God, are you digging a grave

14:21.452 --> 14:23.210
for your dead robot dog?

14:23.312 --> 14:25.946
No. The grave I'm digging...

14:26.457 --> 14:27.623
is for me.

14:27.648 --> 14:30.016
No, Tandy. Think of the children!

14:30.118 --> 14:32.735
No, look, it's not for right now.

14:32.942 --> 14:34.330
It's for years from now.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.823
I don't understand.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.961
Last night, I dug a
grave for that thing.

14:41.406 --> 14:43.073
That's not a dog.

14:43.401 --> 14:45.234
But I convinced myself it was

14:45.259 --> 14:47.894
'cause it was the closest I
could find to the real thing.

14:48.414 --> 14:51.881
But then I saw a
dog... like, a real dog.

14:52.281 --> 14:53.499
And it made me realize

14:53.601 --> 14:56.402
I've been chasing after
something that doesn't exist.

14:57.020 --> 14:58.437
We all have.

14:59.073 --> 15:00.372
What are you saying?

15:00.933 --> 15:02.408
He's saying he wants to live here.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.676
Are you high?

15:03.701 --> 15:05.321
Yeah, Gail, I am high.

15:05.346 --> 15:08.523
Okay, high on fresh
food and clean water.

15:08.548 --> 15:09.714
I mean, this place has

15:09.739 --> 15:12.017
everything we need to make a life.

15:12.119 --> 15:15.154
You know, fertile soil
and natural irrigation,

15:15.256 --> 15:17.256
fields for the goats, you name it.

15:17.358 --> 15:19.158
But it's in the middle of nowhere.

15:19.260 --> 15:21.460
Oh, so you think that
Cancun is gonna be better?

15:21.562 --> 15:25.030
'Cause I can tell you exactly
what we're gonna find there.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.066
Beaches littered with dead bodies,

15:27.168 --> 15:30.002
stores picked clean of all the supplies.

15:30.432 --> 15:33.472
We'll show up, find
a fancy place to live;

15:33.574 --> 15:36.175
then, after six months,
we'll just leave it

15:36.277 --> 15:38.344
for another place
that's exactly like it.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.592
Where does it end?

15:42.859 --> 15:45.633
Look, there's literally
an expiration date

15:45.735 --> 15:47.801
on the way we've been living,

15:47.904 --> 15:50.437
and that date has passed.

15:50.695 --> 15:53.121
So, look, if you guys
want to go to Cancun

15:53.146 --> 15:55.232
and raise our kids on expired pie shells

15:55.257 --> 15:58.939
and mango chutney, hey,
I'll go along with it.

15:59.615 --> 16:02.159
But I happen to think there's
something better out there.

16:02.852 --> 16:04.718
And it's right here.

16:07.757 --> 16:10.453
Well, Tandy, you know my answer.

16:11.894 --> 16:13.661
I'm with you.

16:14.644 --> 16:16.191
Us, too, bud.

16:16.216 --> 16:17.845
Maybe it's time we all grow up.

16:29.045 --> 16:31.396
Tapachula, baby!

16:35.244 --> 16:38.279
Carol, this is actually delicious.

16:38.314 --> 16:39.513
Thanks, Mom.

16:39.549 --> 16:41.349
You know, you wouldn't
think goat hair would make

16:41.384 --> 16:43.217
a good barbecue rub,

16:43.252 --> 16:45.257
but it always surprises.

16:47.244 --> 16:49.390
Hey, uh, Mike.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.325
can I talk to you for a sec?

16:57.344 --> 16:58.510
What's up?

16:58.990 --> 17:00.230
This.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.256
I already, uh, disconnected the train,

17:05.281 --> 17:08.540
so, uh, you can leave whenever you want.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.641
What?

17:10.066 --> 17:12.979
You're not gonna be happy here. Not yet.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.123
You have to go and see what's out there.

17:15.984 --> 17:18.026
Wh... are you sure?

17:29.961 --> 17:31.974
There you go, guys.

17:37.260 --> 17:38.668
So, this is it.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.989
For now.

17:41.024 --> 17:42.790
I have something for you.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.161
This is yours now.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.163
No.

17:54.518 --> 17:55.817
Turn around.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.769
Turn around. Yeah.

18:14.352 --> 18:17.453
Whenever you feel lonely,
give that thing a tug,

18:17.488 --> 18:19.914
and you'll know I'm with you.

18:21.292 --> 18:23.192
Now I feel bad, you know.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.293
I-I didn't get you anything.

18:24.328 --> 18:26.128
Oh, no, that's fine.

18:26.163 --> 18:28.163
Oh, you know what?

18:29.033 --> 18:30.566
Here.

18:31.726 --> 18:33.593
A few armpit hairs.

18:34.566 --> 18:36.866
I know it's not much, but...

18:37.308 --> 18:39.274
I love it.

18:41.518 --> 18:43.718
I hope you find what you're looking for.

18:44.482 --> 18:46.115
Yeah, I do, too.

19:08.758 --> 19:09.958
Is he gone?

19:11.206 --> 19:12.354
Yeah.

19:12.379 --> 19:13.275
Are you okay?

19:13.494 --> 19:14.560
Yeah.

19:14.585 --> 19:16.112
Come here.

19:17.886 --> 19:20.349
Your rattail.

19:20.384 --> 19:22.084
It's gone.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.502
But the rat remains.

19:24.654 --> 19:26.888
He'll cherish it.

19:46.469 --> 19:48.709
So, gals, ready to do this thing?

19:48.734 --> 19:50.345
- Yeah!
- Tandy!

19:50.381 --> 19:53.115
Then let's make like a tree
and put some roots down.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.350
Oh, I'm so jazzed.

19:55.386 --> 19:57.152
It just feels so right.

19:57.188 --> 19:59.092
- I mean, we did it. We really did it.
- Yeah.

19:59.117 --> 20:00.690
Uh, guys...

20:00.715 --> 20:01.990
I mean, sure, you know, we took

20:02.015 --> 20:03.816
a few detours along the way,

20:03.841 --> 20:05.990
but we learned from our
mistakes and, you know,

20:06.015 --> 20:07.329
we figured it all out.

20:07.364 --> 20:09.565
Uh, guys... you better come here.

20:09.593 --> 20:12.340
It's just so friggin' exciting.

20:12.694 --> 20:14.121
For the first time ever...

20:14.146 --> 20:16.605
and hell, even before the virus...

20:17.061 --> 20:19.971
it just finally feels like
things are gonna be okay.

20:19.996 --> 20:21.029
Tandy?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.344
I think you need to see this.

20:22.379 --> 20:23.479
Sure, Care Bear.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.247
It's just so exciting.

20:25.282 --> 20:27.416
I mean, there's just something peaceful

20:27.444 --> 20:30.884
about being in the place
where you know you're gonna...

20:32.211 --> 20:33.589
die.

21:00.402 --> 21:02.822
Oh, farts.
