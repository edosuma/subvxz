So I have private lessons
with Mr. Ken Todd.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.633
The best thing to do is to go
through the whole of L.A.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.333
and take the best cocktail
from every place,

16:58.367 --> 17:00.100
and then all choose
your favorite cocktail.

17:00.133 --> 17:01.633
And that gives us
a place to start.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.633
We get something that I haven't
seen before, you know?

17:03.667 --> 17:05.300
And then put your own
twist on it.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.467
You know how to do that.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.166
I get it.
Lisa is amazing at designing

17:10.200 --> 17:12.233
restaurants, bars, whatnot.

17:12.266 --> 17:13.500
And I got a little excited.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.433
Definitely like to do
something where

17:15.467 --> 17:18.266
we incorporate dry ice
in a cocktail.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.633
'Cause then it'll have the
smoke coming out of the drink.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.400
Loud and clear.

17:22.433 --> 17:25.333
I'm gonna work on the best
freaking cocktails

17:25.367 --> 17:27.367
the world has ever experienced.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.433
- Okay, I'm so hot right now.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.533
Is there anything imperative
that we've gotta talk about?

17:31.567 --> 17:33.300
Can I get out of here?

17:33.333 --> 17:35.266
- I know my role.
- Down on your knees with that.

in public or something?"

But when it comes to letting
people know, like,

41:32.433 --> 41:35.200
why that I would want
to stay with him,

41:35.233 --> 41:39.200
it is just because I'm, like,
madly in love with him still.
