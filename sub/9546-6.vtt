Oh, for Pete sakes.
Out of order - use Stairs

00:17.935 --> 00:19.660
It's out of order again.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.577
Looks like we're taking the stairs then.

00:21.577 --> 00:23.367
After you.

Why don't you go on ahead?
I'm gonna be a while.

00:41.883 --> 00:43.704
Are you Mrs. Rutherford?

00:43.704 --> 00:44.878
That's right.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.509
Katherine Rutherford, the nurse?

00:46.509 --> 00:49.384
Well, not anymore.
I'm retired.

00:49.384 --> 00:50.552
Have we met?

00:50.552 --> 00:53.756
I think you know my wife,
unfortunately.

00:53.756 --> 00:56.184
Why unfortunately?

02:35.527 --> 02:37.237
Morning?

02:38.274 --> 02:41.377
- What's going on?
- Oh, what you see is pretty much it.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.654
What do I see?

02:43.654 --> 02:45.062
It looks like an accident.

02:45.062 --> 02:49.505
Her name's Katherine Rutherford.
62, lives here on the third floor.

02:49.505 --> 02:52.209
Patrol officers called us in
just to make sure.

02:52.209 --> 02:53.931
- What are those?
- Beads.

02:53.931 --> 02:56.189
She was wearing a necklace,
which broke.

02:56.189 --> 02:59.809
She slips on the beads,
breaks her neck.

03:01.936 --> 03:06.244
- Lot of gravity in these stairwells.
- Yes, sir.

03:06.244 --> 03:09.187
I just used the elevator.
Why didn't she?

03:09.187 --> 03:11.332
- Um...
- Was it broken?

03:11.332 --> 03:12.976
Oh, uh...

03:12.976 --> 03:15.773
- If you don't know, just say so.
- I don't know.

03:15.773 --> 03:17.363
Hey are there any beads down there?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.818
No, sir.

03:21.009 --> 03:24.492
If she slipped on the beads,
why didn't any of them roll away?

03:24.492 --> 03:28.161
- Beads, beads, beads, beads.
- You don't know.

03:28.161 --> 03:33.057
Randy... something's wrong here.

03:36.127 --> 03:38.503
This is wrong.

03:40.836 --> 03:43.619
Lift up her head.

03:48.414 --> 03:52.362
It doesn't fit.
It's too small.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.428
Okay, we're changing gears.

03:55.428 --> 03:58.137
Lock down this stairwell from
the basement to the roof.

03:58.137 --> 04:01.249
Call the watch commander.
This is now a homicide investigation.

04:01.249 --> 04:02.849
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.

04:02.849 --> 04:05.411
I just found this under the body.

04:06.194 --> 04:08.805
What is that, a lapel pin?

04:08.805 --> 04:10.533
Yeah, I've seen that before.

04:10.533 --> 04:13.684
I know this pin.
Someone was wearing it.

04:13.684 --> 04:17.088
- Who?
- Hang on.

04:17.332 --> 04:20.334
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

04:20.334 --> 04:22.424
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

04:22.424 --> 04:24.783
Is it straight?
I can't get it straight.

04:24.783 --> 04:27.832
Why don't you just stand at
a slight angle?

04:27.832 --> 04:29.766
- Mr. Monk, maybe I should stay.
- No, no.

04:29.766 --> 04:32.350
- No, my parents can pick up Julie.
- I'm fine.

04:32.350 --> 04:36.662
Well, it's just that the last time you saw
these people, you were with Trudy.

04:36.662 --> 04:38.584
And I remember, after Mitch died,

04:38.584 --> 04:42.489
how difficult it was, you know,
going to parties and seeing our friends.

04:42.489 --> 04:44.661
- That's when I missed him the most.
- I'm way ahead of you.

04:44.661 --> 04:47.411
I did all my crying last night.
I'm good to go.

04:47.411 --> 04:49.120
- I'm gonna call my parents.
- No.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.187
Relax, will you?
This is Berkeley.

04:51.187 --> 04:52.870
It's like my second home.

04:52.870 --> 04:55.306
Wish you could have seen me
here... Trudy and me.

04:55.306 --> 04:58.303
We had a million friends.
We owned this place.

04:58.303 --> 05:01.532
I hope Dinky comes.
Crazy Dinky Feeber.

05:01.532 --> 05:04.140
He was always getting off
these great zingers.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.609
I hope Craig Hopper comes.

05:05.609 --> 05:08.402
He was always explaining
Dinky's zingers to me.

05:08.402 --> 05:10.136
They made a great team.

05:10.136 --> 05:12.726
Oh, have you filled out
your registration form?

05:12.726 --> 05:15.058
Yeah, yeah, I filled it out,
six months ago.

05:15.058 --> 05:16.737
Oh, my God.
It that...

05:16.737 --> 05:18.442
Is that Smitty?

05:18.442 --> 05:19.945
Smitty?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.365
Smito!

05:21.365 --> 05:23.482
Smit man!

05:25.617 --> 05:27.837
Uh, I thought that was Smitty.

05:27.837 --> 05:31.353
That guy looked just like Smitty.

05:31.353 --> 05:33.164
You... you still have my invitation.

05:33.164 --> 05:35.235
Oh, yes, I do.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.648
Here you go. / Yep.

05:37.648 --> 05:41.678
"Adrian 'Captain Cool' Monk"?
Who's Captain Cool?

05:41.678 --> 05:43.353
Me.

05:43.353 --> 05:47.630
- That was my nickname.
- You were Captain Cool? Why?

05:47.630 --> 05:50.520
- Why do you think?
- I don't know.

05:51.805 --> 05:55.043
- Why do you think?
- I don't know.

05:55.043 --> 05:57.560
Look, I didn't write the invitation, did I?

05:57.560 --> 06:00.837
Okay.
Okay, well, uh, good luck.

06:00.837 --> 06:04.415
And I will see you here at 7:00, okay?

06:04.415 --> 06:06.586
Captain.

06:23.109 --> 06:26.553
- Adrian?
- Diane. Diane Sooner.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.367
Not anymore.
It's Diane Brooks.

06:28.367 --> 06:32.240
Oh. / Oh, my gosh,
you look great. Oh, my...

06:32.240 --> 06:34.771
I can't be...
You haven't changed at all.

06:34.771 --> 06:38.601
Neither have you.
Except for, you know, your age.

06:39.836 --> 06:45.064
Well, you know.
I don't think I've seen you since,

06:45.064 --> 06:48.079
well, the since the memorial
service, I guess, right? / Yeah.

06:48.079 --> 06:50.547
How are you doing?
Are you...Are you dating?

06:50.547 --> 06:52.573
No, no... no.

06:52.573 --> 06:56.577
No, no, no, no.
No, no... no, no.

06:56.577 --> 06:58.761
Well... maybe you'll meet
someone here.

06:58.761 --> 07:02.957
No, I don't  think... nah... no.

07:02.957 --> 07:06.901
- Well, you never know.
- Yeah...  yeah, you do.

07:06.901 --> 07:08.701
Well,  um... hey,
where are you staying?

07:08.701 --> 07:11.533
At home. About a half-hour from here.
Just across the bay.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.973
Oh...Oh, you know what,
that reminds me,

07:13.973 --> 07:17.066
I... I forgot to fill out my form.
Remember me? Right?

07:17.066 --> 07:19.944
- Always the last minute.
- Always. / Yeah.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.781
You know what?
Do you mind? / Oh...

07:22.781 --> 07:24.586
Can I...

07:27.261 --> 07:30.582
You know, actually,
my.... my hus... sorry.

07:30.582 --> 07:33.706
My husband Kyle is
dying to meet you.

07:33.706 --> 07:35.627
- He... he is?
- Oh, yeah.

07:35.627 --> 07:39.032
He has been asking
about you every day. For months.

07:39.032 --> 07:43.070
"Do you think Adrian Monk is coming?"
You know, "is he really coming?"

07:43.070 --> 07:47.314
Huh. / Yeah.
He is gonna be so excited.

07:47.314 --> 07:48.571
Great.

07:49.003 --> 07:50.836
Thank you.

07:50.836 --> 07:52.947
Is this thing on?
Oh!

07:52.947 --> 07:57.647
Hello.
Welcome back, class of 1981.

08:00.276 --> 08:02.699
I'd like to thank everyone for coming.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.577
We have a lot of
great events planned,

08:04.577 --> 08:07.695
culminating in a big dinner
and slide show tomorrow night.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.149
Are there any questions?

08:09.149 --> 08:12.858
Yeah, how'd everybody else
get so old?

08:13.884 --> 08:16.879
Now, come on.
I think we all look fantastic.

08:16.879 --> 08:18.909
Does everyone here
have a lapel pin?

08:18.909 --> 08:22.259
Okay, you need these to get into
all the events and into the cafeteria.

08:22.259 --> 08:25.944
So if you lose one or you need another,
there's a box of them in the corner.

08:25.944 --> 08:27.415
Help yourself.

08:27.415 --> 08:32.856
I guess that's it. Have fun
and I'll see you around the campus.

08:56.921 --> 08:58.576
- Just some water.
- Ice?

08:58.576 --> 08:59.871
Ten.

08:59.871 --> 09:01.261
Ten what?

09:01.261 --> 09:03.285
Cubes.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.060
- Wild. It's so wild.
- Hi.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.434
Hi. Hello.

09:10.434 --> 09:13.358
Simon. Juliet.
Oh, my God.

09:13.358 --> 09:15.496
Dennis, I can't believe it.

09:15.496 --> 09:17.453
Hey.

09:17.453 --> 09:20.769
Honey, you remember Mr. Amonk.

09:20.769 --> 09:25.667
No, um..
No, it's A. Monk.

09:25.667 --> 09:29.342
Adrian Monk.
Adrian Monk.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.053
Right.

09:34.582 --> 09:36.798
I was dating Trudy Ellison.

09:36.798 --> 09:39.407
Oh, Trudy.
Yes, I loved her.

09:39.407 --> 09:44.000
- Wasn't she great?
- I think about her all the time.

09:53.181 --> 09:59.207
- Well... take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

10:04.848 --> 10:08.913
- Ten cubes.
- You're welcome.

10:16.691 --> 10:18.322
Oh, shoot.

10:18.322 --> 10:20.994
Hi, excuse me.
Are you going to the reunion?

10:20.994 --> 10:23.867
That's right. / Oh, great.
Could you give these keys to Adrian Monk?

10:23.867 --> 10:26.358
- Who?
- Adrian Monk?

10:26.358 --> 10:28.912
Um, Captain Cool?

10:28.912 --> 10:30.708
Captain Cool?
Is he here?

10:30.708 --> 10:32.710
- Yeah.
- Sure. I'd be glad to.

10:32.710 --> 10:35.276
Okay, great. Thank you.
Have fun.  / Okay.

10:35.276 --> 10:36.940
Who's Captain Cool?

10:36.940 --> 10:38.415
He was this weird guy.

10:38.415 --> 10:41.322
Real nervous.
Always worried about everything.

10:41.322 --> 10:44.350
He spent every weekend
defrosting his refrigerator.

10:44.350 --> 10:47.388
So we called him Captain Cool.

10:52.064 --> 10:56.318
The last time I saw you was
Mischief Night, 1981.

10:56.318 --> 11:00.597
You and your friends were
throwing toilet paper everywhere, right?

11:00.597 --> 11:03.411
- Mischief Night.
- That's right. / Right.

11:04.050 --> 11:05.519
I don't remember you.

11:05.519 --> 11:08.769
I wasn't with you.
I was following you.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.828
- I was cleaning up.
- Was that you?

11:10.828 --> 11:13.543
You had a girlfriend
with short red hair.

11:13.543 --> 11:15.772
- Belinda. / Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:15.772 --> 11:17.950
She and I, we got married.

11:17.950 --> 11:20.938
But, uh, she passed away.

11:20.938 --> 11:25.409
Oh, my wife died too.
Trudy Ellison.

11:25.409 --> 11:28.867
- Yeah.
- It's tough, huh?

11:28.867 --> 11:31.762
But you just have to move on.

11:31.762 --> 11:35.162
No, we can't move on.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.619
We can try,
but we'll never get past it.

11:38.619 --> 11:40.442
It's unrelenting.

11:40.442 --> 11:44.532
All we can do is
live out our days alone

11:44.532 --> 11:48.785
in hopeless,
quite desperation.

11:48.785 --> 11:50.503
Would you excuse me?

11:50.503 --> 11:53.498
I, um...
I'm remarried.

11:53.498 --> 11:56.331
My family's waiting for me.

12:10.627 --> 12:12.363
Thank you.

12:19.416 --> 12:22.142
Captain? The lapel pin.
I just remembered where I saw it.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.177
- Where?
- Just now at my desk.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.122
No, I mean where...
Tell me about the pin, Randy.

12:27.122 --> 12:31.483
Monk. He's been wearing the same pin
all week for his 25th college reunion.

12:31.483 --> 12:33.539
I think you're right.

12:33.931 --> 12:36.588
- Did the victim to go Berkeley?
- No, she worked there.

12:36.588 --> 12:39.339
She was a nurse in the university clinic
for, like, 20 years.

12:39.339 --> 12:42.468
But she didn't graduate,
so this isn't her pin.

12:42.468 --> 12:44.471
The killer.

12:45.413 --> 12:48.074
It fell off the killer.

12:48.758 --> 12:53.495
Which means the killer is at the
reunion... with Monk?

13:00.141 --> 13:02.804
This looks delicious.
So this is where you ate?

13:02.804 --> 13:05.403
- I mean, this was your hangout?
- I don't know.

13:05.403 --> 13:07.990
Natalie, I think I've seen enough.
Let's just go.

13:07.990 --> 13:09.611
No, I'm not gonna let you go.

13:09.611 --> 13:13.457
- You've been looking so forward to this.
- I don't know what I was thinking.

13:13.457 --> 13:16.247
These people weren't my friends.
Okay?

13:16.247 --> 13:18.735
They don't even remember me.

13:18.735 --> 13:20.532
The truth is, I was invisible.

13:20.532 --> 13:23.287
It was Trudy they loved.

13:23.287 --> 13:25.642
I was always just
the guy with Trudy.

13:25.642 --> 13:28.534
Just like you're the girl with me.

13:28.534 --> 13:31.809
Mr. Monk, why is your name
on the spit shield?

13:31.809 --> 13:35.802
Oh, when I was here, there was
nothing protecting the food.

13:35.802 --> 13:39.218
So you donated all of these?
That is so generous of you.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.842
Well, actually,
it was more of a lawsuit.

13:41.842 --> 13:43.609
Took up a lot of my spare time.

13:43.609 --> 13:47.186
Adrian. There you are.
We've been looking for you.

13:47.186 --> 13:49.702
- Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger.
- Hi.

13:49.702 --> 13:53.121
- Diane Brooks.
- I'm his assistant.

13:53.121 --> 13:56.980
Ah.
Oh, so you two aren't...

13:56.980 --> 13:58.072
No.

13:58.072 --> 14:02.078
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no. Not... no, no, no.

14:02.078 --> 14:03.210
Okay.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.440
- Where are you sitting?
- I'm not... we're not...

14:05.440 --> 14:07.724
Kyle and I are over here.
We saved you a seat.

14:07.724 --> 14:11.332
Fair warning,
we brought a lot of pictures.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.960
See, you have a friend.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.640
No, she was Trudy's roommate
freshman year.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.769
- Well, she saved us a seat.
- Out of pity.

14:18.769 --> 14:21.400
It's what we call pity seats.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.835
It's just pity.

14:25.022 --> 14:26.840
So, Kyle, you didn't go to Berkeley?

14:26.840 --> 14:28.512
Me? Hell, no.

14:28.512 --> 14:31.232
Community college.
CC all the way.

14:31.232 --> 14:33.069
Never had much of that book learning.

14:33.069 --> 14:34.568
Kyle works for my father now.

14:34.568 --> 14:36.922
He's one of our top salespeople.

14:36.922 --> 14:39.105
Yeah, it's like Monopoly money.

14:39.105 --> 14:42.004
Daddy pays me and I give it all to her.

14:42.004 --> 14:44.008
Kyle, not now.
You promised.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.164
So, Adrian, what do you do?

14:46.164 --> 14:49.458
I'm a private detective.
I do some consulting.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.424
Really?
Sorry.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.061
You don't look like a detective.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.661
We don't have any children, so we just
show pictures of our house instead.

14:57.661 --> 15:00.137
Oh.
Well, it's beautiful.

15:00.137 --> 15:01.859
We designed it ourselves.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.338
And that's Tangerine.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.694
Wait...

15:06.694 --> 15:10.302
Didn't you used to have a dog
named Tangerine?

15:10.302 --> 15:12.499
What a memory!

15:12.499 --> 15:16.137
That's amazing. Trudy was always
bragging about his amazing memory.

15:16.137 --> 15:17.305
That's right.

15:17.305 --> 15:21.290
I had a  poodle junior and senior year...
Tangerine. / That's right.

15:21.290 --> 15:24.441
And then Kyle brought home this
big ball of love a couple weeks ago.

15:24.441 --> 15:25.947
Yeah.
He was already named.

15:25.947 --> 15:28.708
That's what they were calling him
at the shelter; Tangerine.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.704
Isn't that funny?
What are the odds of that?

15:30.704 --> 15:32.653
That's...

15:32.653 --> 15:34.796
'One in a million, maybe.
One in a trillion.

15:34.796 --> 15:36.285
Mr. Monk, forget about the dog.

15:36.285 --> 15:40.135
How could the same person have
two dogs... 25 years apart...

15:40.135 --> 15:42.107
just happen to be named Tangerine?

15:42.107 --> 15:44.457
Tangerine?
And this Tangerine is black.

15:44.457 --> 15:46.234
Why would anybody lie
about a dog's name?

15:46.234 --> 15:47.735
I don't know.

15:47.735 --> 15:51.315
But there is something weird
about that guy.

15:51.315 --> 15:54.593
Diane said that he couldn't wait
to meet me.

15:54.593 --> 15:56.692
But he didn't even know
I was a detective.

15:56.692 --> 15:59.200
Mr. Monk, come on.
Let's have some fun.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.041
You said you were gonna show me
your dorm room.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.022
All right.
It's right here.

16:03.022 --> 16:05.528
This is it.
Old 303.

16:05.528 --> 16:08.406
Uh... oh.
Tie on the doorknob.

16:08.406 --> 16:11.116
My roommate and I did
the same thing. It's a code.

16:11.116 --> 16:13.862
Yeah, I think I might know
about that. / Yeah.

16:13.862 --> 16:19.051
It means don't come in, I'm
reorganizing my closet.

16:19.051 --> 16:20.249
Your closet?

16:20.249 --> 16:22.104
Yeah, my roommate freshman year,
Greg...

16:22.104 --> 16:26.181
he reorganized his closet
four or five times a week.

16:26.181 --> 16:29.483
Uh.. huh. And did his girlfriend
ever come over to help?

16:29.483 --> 16:30.983
Oh, yeah.
All the time.

16:30.983 --> 16:33.884
They were real neat freaks.
I used to tease him about it.

16:33.884 --> 16:36.025
"Neat freak."

16:38.364 --> 16:40.785
Oh, my God.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.186
Oh, my God.

16:44.186 --> 16:47.791
I can't believe it.

16:50.522 --> 16:53.153
He's still here.

16:53.527 --> 16:56.740
Hello, old friend.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.390
Remember me?

16:59.390 --> 17:04.619
Oh, I knew we'd meet again.
It is our destiny.

17:06.512 --> 17:11.821
Natalie, put your hand right there.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.771
Do you feel that?

17:13.771 --> 17:15.009
No.

17:15.925 --> 17:18.449
He's afraid.

17:18.775 --> 17:21.896
Step back.
Step back.

17:21.896 --> 17:24.729
I'm going in.

17:28.251 --> 17:31.230
Whoa.

17:32.991 --> 17:36.340
I'm gonna need a spatula...

17:36.962 --> 17:39.169
a pan...

17:39.797 --> 17:42.192
and a Bible.

17:53.591 --> 17:55.532
There you are.

17:55.818 --> 17:57.091
Captain, what are you doing here?

17:57.091 --> 18:00.060
Looking for you.
I was about to give up,

18:00.060 --> 18:02.519
then I heard some clowns downstairs
talking about a guy up here

18:02.519 --> 18:04.894
defrosting a refrigerator.

18:04.894 --> 18:06.726
Who's Captain Cool?

18:08.785 --> 18:10.230
Captain Cool lives.

18:10.230 --> 18:12.749
The return of Captain Cool.

18:13.053 --> 18:15.550
The Iceman coming back.

18:18.346 --> 18:20.698
Might be me.

18:23.918 --> 18:25.852
- Katherine Rutherford.
- Ring a bell?

18:25.852 --> 18:27.912
She was a nurse here at the
school clinic.

18:27.912 --> 18:29.758
Found one of these near her body.

18:29.758 --> 18:31.502
- A reunion pin?
- Yeah.

18:31.502 --> 18:33.509
Did you notice anybody missing a pin?

18:33.509 --> 18:35.660
- I haven't noticed.
- I guess not.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.949
Hey, Monk.
How's memory lane?

18:37.949 --> 18:39.899
Oh, pretty awful.
Thanks for asking.

18:39.899 --> 18:42.994
Listen, I was at the security office
going through some old files.

18:42.994 --> 18:46.814
Think we've got a name...
Henry Kalimarakis.

18:46.814 --> 18:49.993
Well, that's a name. / Oh, oh, oh,
he was on the swim team.

18:49.993 --> 18:52.251
Correct.
He was trying out for the Olympics.

18:52.251 --> 18:55.250
25 years ago, Nurse Rutherford
administered a drug test.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.964
Henry came back positive for steroids.

18:57.964 --> 19:00.906
She turned him in, he threatened her.
Said she ruined his life.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.057
Well, that's what the kids
call a motive.

19:03.057 --> 19:05.705
Then he waited 25 years to do
something about it?

19:05.705 --> 19:08.020
Who could hold a grudge for that long?

19:08.020 --> 19:10.688
I could... and have.

19:10.688 --> 19:12.472
Let's check him out.

19:12.472 --> 19:13.509
Wanna come with?

19:13.509 --> 19:15.894
Maybe later.
I want to show Natalie the library.

19:15.894 --> 19:17.507
I was just there.
It's nothing special.

19:17.507 --> 19:19.441
It's where he met Trudy.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.980
Have fun.

19:23.448 --> 19:25.941
Oops, I didn't know
he met Trudy there.

19:25.941 --> 19:29.530
I used to work here part time.

19:29.530 --> 19:32.038
It was here.

19:32.038 --> 19:35.332
I was standing right here.

19:35.332 --> 19:37.344
It was a Tuesday, 4:30.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.425
She was wearing a white blouse.
There was a button missing.

19:40.425 --> 19:43.870
There was little thread sticking up.

19:43.870 --> 19:47.165
You remember it like it was yesterday.

19:47.907 --> 19:50.555
It was yesterday.

20:03.873 --> 20:07.150
Excuse me.
Hello.

20:07.150 --> 20:08.765
I can't find a book.

20:08.765 --> 20:12.849
This is not the Dewey Decimal
System that I know and love.

20:12.849 --> 20:14.938
Do you work here?

20:15.227 --> 20:18.083
Yes, I...
Yes, I do.

20:18.083 --> 20:21.357
Uh, here's the thing.

20:22.409 --> 20:25.118
We're reorganizing.

20:25.118 --> 20:31.592
And uh... we're...we're moving
all the stacks upstairs.

20:31.592 --> 20:32.870
What are you looking for?

20:32.870 --> 20:34.401
This is a long shot.

20:34.401 --> 20:39.590
Trevor Rosenthal's biography
of Alexander Pope. Volume two.

20:41.012 --> 20:44.050
Uh, yeah, I...

20:56.662 --> 20:58.770
How did you do that?

20:58.770 --> 21:00.468
I saw it last week.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.453
And you remembered?

21:02.453 --> 21:05.536
If I see something once,
I never forget it.

21:05.536 --> 21:08.560
That sounds pretty awful.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.234
My bad memory is my salvation.

21:13.234 --> 21:19.058
"Thus let me live, unseen, unknown.
Thus unlamented, let me die..."

21:19.058 --> 21:22.585
"Steal from the world and not a
stone tell where I lie."

21:22.585 --> 21:24.408
You know Alexander Pope.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.389
- It's just...
- So you never forget anything?

21:27.389 --> 21:29.223
For example, you're never
gonna forget this?

21:29.223 --> 21:31.495
Me, us talking right now?

21:31.495 --> 21:35.306
Hey, Captain Cool,
you work here, right?

21:35.306 --> 21:38.909
- Where's the Xerox machine?
- Downstairs.

21:38.909 --> 21:41.490
Whoa, hey...
It's Trudy, right?

21:41.490 --> 21:44.297
Yeah, I met you at Poor Herbie's
two weeks ago.

21:44.297 --> 21:45.768
I've been thinking about you.

21:45.768 --> 21:47.877
You owe me a few hours
of sleep, young lady.

21:47.877 --> 21:51.565
Drew, right? / You got it.
I wanted to call you.

21:51.565 --> 21:54.076
I've been dying to call you,
but I lost your phone number.

21:54.076 --> 21:57.329
Oh, please. / It's true.
It's been driving me crazy.

21:57.329 --> 22:00.428
Have a little mercy here
and give me another chance?

22:00.428 --> 22:02.923
Well, it's a new number.
I don't even know it myself.

22:02.923 --> 22:05.266
Hey, Captain, do me a favor?

22:07.188 --> 22:10.188
What, uh...
What are you doing?

22:10.188 --> 22:12.930
You mean now?
Going back to the student center.

22:12.930 --> 22:15.623
Me too.
I'll walk you.

22:15.623 --> 22:17.857
- Are these yours?
- Yeah.

22:17.857 --> 22:20.666
See, chivalry isn't dead.

22:30.574 --> 22:31.992
And that's how I got her number.

22:31.992 --> 22:35.880
Wa... wait, you mean when he wrote it
on your back, you could feel it?

22:35.880 --> 22:38.486
- You could do that?
- I have very sensitive skin.

22:38.486 --> 22:40.121
That's like a superpower.

22:40.121 --> 22:44.835
Like a really weird, not very
useful superpower.

22:44.835 --> 22:48.299
It took me three weeks to call her.
It was the bravest thing I ever did.

22:48.299 --> 22:50.734
She was already dating that
other guy, Drew.

22:50.734 --> 22:55.324
Yeah, but she chose you.
Never forget that. She chose you.

22:55.324 --> 22:57.811
Yeah, but I don't know why.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.852
I mean, he was just written up
in Time magazine last year.

22:59.852 --> 23:03.117
He's a famous heart surgeon.
He's rich, he's happy.

23:03.117 --> 23:04.674
What was she thinking?

23:04.674 --> 23:09.123
Oh, Mr. Monk, she knew
exactly what she was doing.

23:09.123 --> 23:12.499
I can't believe this kiosk got
all cluttered again.

23:12.499 --> 23:15.956
Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to
just come back for your 50th.

23:16.287 --> 23:17.913
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

23:17.913 --> 23:20.752
Adrian. Oh, my God.
Did you hear about Nurse Rutherford?

23:20.752 --> 23:24.546
- Ah, yes we were just talking about it.
- Can you believe it? The police are here.

23:24.546 --> 23:27.066
They're talking to everybody.
They said she was killed.

23:27.066 --> 23:28.399
Were you close with her?

23:28.399 --> 23:31.259
Well, I haven't talked to her
for years. But...

23:31.259 --> 23:33.847
- But still.
- Horrible. It's horrible.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.410
Diane.

23:35.410 --> 23:37.691
Hey, honey, are you okay?

23:38.660 --> 23:43.229
The nurse who died...Rutherford.
Apparently, Diane used to know her.

23:43.229 --> 23:46.414
These things happen, right?
I mean, it's a big city.

23:46.414 --> 23:48.572
- Hello.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

23:48.572 --> 23:51.000
Have you all met?
This is Trudy. / Gertrude.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.947
But your nickname's Trudy, right?

23:52.947 --> 23:55.246
I had... I had an aunt that
called me Trudy.

23:55.246 --> 23:56.616
So it's Trudy.

23:56.616 --> 24:00.386
Trudy and I met over at the fountain,
and I've invited her to join us for lunch.

24:00.386 --> 24:01.959
Okay, all right, where are we eating?

24:01.959 --> 24:04.332
How about Rocco's?

24:04.332 --> 24:06.046
- Rocco's?
- Rocco's.

24:06.046 --> 24:08.446
Honey, you've been telling me
about Rocco's for years.

24:08.446 --> 24:09.950
You said it was your favorite hangout.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.223
Honey, I'm not even sure
it's still there.

24:11.223 --> 24:14.219
It is. I checked. / No, no, no, no.
Rocco's, you don't want...

24:14.219 --> 24:16.011
That... that place is terrible.

24:16.011 --> 24:19.746
They have this...
this rotisserie thing in the window,

24:19.746 --> 24:23.852
with this one sad, lonely hot dog
going around and around and around.

24:23.852 --> 24:25.708
That sounds great.
Huh? Come on.

24:25.708 --> 24:28.690
I'm not taking no for an answer.
It'll be my treat.

24:28.690 --> 24:30.587
Come on, let's go have lunch. Huh?

24:30.587 --> 24:32.551
Honey, are you okay?
What's going on?

24:32.551 --> 24:35.414
I just want you to have a great
reunion, huh? Who's hungry?

24:35.414 --> 24:36.826
Actually, I've already eaten.

24:36.826 --> 24:40.061
Oh, Trudy, have some coffee.
There's always room for coffee, huh?

24:40.061 --> 24:41.303
Here we go.

24:41.303 --> 24:43.222
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

24:43.222 --> 24:45.048
I can't believe I'm eating
at Rocco's again.

24:45.048 --> 24:49.349
I used to have nightmares
about that hotdog.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.741
Hey, it's me.

25:03.496 --> 25:06.022
Yeah, I just left her.
She's sleeping.

25:06.022 --> 25:08.411
The sleep of the innocent.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.984
Yeah, we all ate at Rocco's.

25:11.984 --> 25:14.758
Took some doing, but I finally got
everybody to go.

25:14.758 --> 25:17.863
Now all I have to do is get everybody
to play touch football tomorrow,

25:17.863 --> 25:19.870
and we're home free.

25:21.372 --> 25:25.297
Hang tight, baby.
Just one more night. She'll be dead.

25:25.297 --> 25:30.438
and it'll be just you, me, and
a big pile of money.

25:40.649 --> 25:42.348
Oh, look.

25:42.348 --> 25:45.920
There's a reception "for all current
and past chess club members."

25:45.920 --> 25:49.151
Weren't you in the chess club?
That sounds like fun.

25:49.735 --> 25:51.219
You never know.
Could be fun.

25:51.219 --> 25:54.495
Natalie, have you ever seen
a chess club?

25:54.495 --> 25:56.452
- What are you doing?
- Weeds.

25:56.452 --> 25:57.938
Mr. Monk, there are weeds everywhere.

25:57.938 --> 26:00.663
What are you gonna do clean
up the whole campus?

26:06.247 --> 26:07.638
Here it is.

26:07.638 --> 26:10.634
Katherine Rutherford's
employment file. / Yeah.

26:10.634 --> 26:13.743
So, if there were any complaints
or any grievances against her,

26:13.743 --> 26:15.116
they'd be in here, right?

26:15.116 --> 26:16.786
We'd have a copy of it, yeah.

26:16.786 --> 26:20.181
But I can't think of anyone who
had anything bad to say about her.

26:20.181 --> 26:22.629
Katie was an angel.
A great nurse.

26:22.629 --> 26:25.325
- It's just heartbreaking.
- Yeah.

26:25.325 --> 26:28.173
Did you...
did you go to school here?

26:28.173 --> 26:29.974
Me? No.

26:29.974 --> 26:31.664
You look familiar.

26:31.664 --> 26:34.725
- Maybe one of your kids?
- No.

26:34.725 --> 26:37.891
I was here one time, though,
for a no-nukes rally.

26:37.891 --> 26:39.092
That was a long time ago.

26:39.092 --> 26:41.693
- Yeah, that must be it.
- It must be.

26:41.693 --> 26:43.286
Captain?

26:44.628 --> 26:48.151
I tracked Kalimarakis.
I don't think he's our guy.

26:48.151 --> 26:52.095
Number one, it turns out he was allowed to
join the Olympic swim team as an alternate.

26:52.095 --> 26:55.285
- He got a waiver.
- So there's no motive. / Right.

26:55.285 --> 26:57.618
Number two, he's dead.
He died in 1995.

26:57.618 --> 26:59.953
And number three, he moved to
Europe in the late '80s.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.602
So there's no record of him
ever returning...

27:01.602 --> 27:03.632
Randy... Randy, excuse me.

27:03.632 --> 27:07.172
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but
could you read number two again?

27:07.172 --> 27:09.738
Okeydoke.
He's dead.

27:09.738 --> 27:11.489
Right.

27:11.489 --> 27:14.307
See, I probably would have
stopped reading after number two.

27:14.307 --> 27:17.574
In fact, I would have read
number two first.

27:17.574 --> 27:19.349
- You would have switched, them?
- Yeah.

27:19.349 --> 27:20.899
But that's just me.

27:20.899 --> 27:25.251
And probably every other adult
on the planet Earth.

27:25.251 --> 27:26.670
Anything in her file?

27:26.670 --> 27:29.904
No, not a single complaint.

27:31.658 --> 27:33.516
Excuse me.
Is this the right place?

27:33.516 --> 27:36.657
It says, "In loving memory of
Katherine Rutherford."

27:36.657 --> 27:39.144
Yeah, this is the place.

27:43.064 --> 27:44.808
Thank you.

27:45.488 --> 27:47.643
That was a lovely wreath.

27:47.643 --> 27:49.217
She must've meant a lot to you.

27:49.217 --> 27:52.118
Katherine Rutherford saved my life.

27:52.118 --> 27:54.780
My senior year was
really tough for me.

27:54.780 --> 27:57.761
I remember.
Your mother passed away.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.569
That's right.

28:00.432 --> 28:02.660
I was in a really bad place.

28:02.660 --> 28:07.588
So I wrote a note...
a suicide note.

28:07.588 --> 28:10.401
I don't even remember what is said.

28:10.401 --> 28:13.675
And then I took 53 little white pills.

28:13.675 --> 28:15.324
Katherine was worried about me.

28:15.324 --> 28:17.031
So she came by the apartment,

28:17.031 --> 28:20.033
she broke down the door,
and she called 911.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.764
I wouldn't be here today.

28:21.764 --> 28:24.545
A wreath, you know, a few
flowers, it's the least I could do.

28:24.545 --> 28:27.647
Hey, who's up for some
football, huh?

28:27.647 --> 28:29.964
Football? / Yeah, yeah,
come on. Four on four.

28:29.964 --> 28:32.202
These guys just challenged
us to a game.

28:32.202 --> 28:34.882
No, we didn't.
Your boy here challenged us.

28:34.882 --> 28:38.462
Whatever. Come on, we gotta show
these guys how it's done, huh?

28:38.462 --> 28:39.827
Old school.

28:39.827 --> 28:42.278
Come on, it'll cheer us up.
Let's play.

28:42.278 --> 28:44.858
Everybody's playing.
Natalie, Adrian, come on.

28:44.858 --> 28:46.334
A little bit of touch football?

28:46.334 --> 28:48.904
Here's...
Here's the thing.

28:48.904 --> 28:50.873
I'm not a big football person.

28:50.873 --> 28:53.610
And the touching, that doesn't
really help matters.

28:53.610 --> 28:55.653
Okay, Adrian, help me out, please.

28:55.653 --> 28:57.957
Diane has been
a little depressed lately.

28:57.957 --> 29:01.101
All I'm doing is trying
to cheer her up.

29:01.101 --> 29:04.477
- Oh, here, I'll hold them.
- Oh, thank you.

29:04.477 --> 29:06.747
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- All right. I'm in too.

29:06.747 --> 29:07.855
Let's go.
Let's do it.

29:07.855 --> 29:11.425
Uh, let's make the end zones that tree
to the walkway.

29:11.425 --> 29:13.505
We'll be shirts.

29:13.505 --> 29:17.324
Okay, Randy.  Randy...
you stay and play football if you want to.

29:17.324 --> 29:21.473
I'm gonna go work on this little
homicide investigation.

29:23.305 --> 29:25.310
I gotta go.

29:27.186 --> 29:30.075
Look at that. Look at that.
And you said you don't play,

29:30.075 --> 29:31.732
Come on, let's go, you guys.

29:31.732 --> 29:34.610
Watch it, fellas. Watch it.
That's all I'm gonna say.

29:34.610 --> 29:36.677
Let's see a little hustle.

29:37.030 --> 29:38.873
Randy.

29:40.397 --> 29:43.167
Okay, let's huddle up.
Come on, everybody in.

29:43.167 --> 29:47.249
All right, Adrian, I want you to go
out, and then cut over to the left.

29:47.249 --> 29:52.418
So that's one inch up,
and three inches to the left?

29:52.418 --> 29:55.670
No, Mr. Monk, it... it, it's
like a map. Like a scale map.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.840
- Okay, what's the scale?
- I don't know.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.303
Uh, one inch is 20 feet.

30:00.303 --> 30:02.082
So that's 60 feet.

30:02.082 --> 30:05.453
I... I, I'm gonna be in the shrubs.
You're sending me into the shrubs?

30:05.453 --> 30:07.355
Okay, you know what?
Let's keep it simple. All right?

30:07.355 --> 30:09.276
Everybody just go out.
Try and get open.

30:09.276 --> 30:11.927
And if you get the ball,
don't get touched.

30:11.927 --> 30:13.856
Okay, give the ball to Mr. Monk.
He hates being touched.

30:13.856 --> 30:16.258
All right, break.
Here we go. Here we go.

30:16.258 --> 30:17.921
Adrian, you hike it to me.

30:17.921 --> 30:21.249
And ready, hike.

30:23.957 --> 30:26.921
Adrian.
Hike.

30:30.415 --> 30:31.999
Come on.

30:37.504 --> 30:38.870
What's up.

31:17.788 --> 31:20.009
Go, go, go, go, go.

31:26.157 --> 31:30.396
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Monk!
Yeah!

31:32.367 --> 31:35.091
Okay, Diane, you're going to be
quarterback this time. / What? Me?

31:35.091 --> 31:38.300
I don't know what I'm doing. / Sure
you do. Listen. Just look for me, okay?

31:38.300 --> 31:40.367
I'm gonna get open.
And break.

31:40.367 --> 31:41.887
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:41.887 --> 31:43.625
All right, uh...
Say "hike."

31:43.625 --> 31:46.601
Okay, okay, hike.

31:50.004 --> 31:53.730
Diane, over here.
I'm open.

31:57.635 --> 32:00.910
Sorry, that was my bad.
It was the sun in my eyes.

32:00.910 --> 32:03.864
Oh, my God, that is so weird.

32:03.864 --> 32:05.536
I can't believe that happened again.

32:05.536 --> 32:06.913
What?

32:06.913 --> 32:11.810
I broke a... I broke a window
in the science building
right over there my senior year.

32:11.810 --> 32:15.910
I tried to force it open,
and it just shattered.

32:15.910 --> 32:19.498
Guess the jinx continues, huh?

32:36.990 --> 32:38.667
He missed that ball on purpose.

32:38.667 --> 32:40.147
He dropped his hands.

32:40.147 --> 32:41.972
I think he wanted her
to break that glass.

32:41.972 --> 32:43.138
But why, Mr. Monk?

32:43.138 --> 32:45.769
And the dog. What about the dog
with the same name?

32:45.769 --> 32:47.760
And how he insisted everybody
eat at Rocco's?

32:47.760 --> 32:50.656
What was that all about? / I don't know.
Maybe the guy is eccentric.

32:50.656 --> 32:52.557
No, I'm eccentric.

32:52.557 --> 32:54.600
He's up to something.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.559
Oh, yeah!

32:56.918 --> 33:01.876
That's Trudy Ellison and, um...
What was his name?

33:01.876 --> 33:03.296
Adrian Monk.

33:03.296 --> 33:05.651
No, that's not it.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.355
Um, Anthony something.

33:08.355 --> 33:09.342
Excuse me.

33:09.342 --> 33:11.814
- Adrian Monk.
- No, no, that's not it.

33:11.814 --> 33:13.775
It's um...

33:13.775 --> 33:16.282
What is his name?

33:35.724 --> 33:38.497
Folks!
Excuse me.

33:38.497 --> 33:40.352
Could you kill the music?

33:40.352 --> 33:42.109
Thank you.

33:43.291 --> 33:46.742
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.
This will just take a minute.

33:46.742 --> 33:50.559
My name is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.
I'm with the San Francisco
police department.

33:50.559 --> 33:54.895
And we're working on a homicide
investigation and we could use you help.

33:54.895 --> 33:58.103
As you may know, a woman was
killed on Friday night.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.038
Her name was Katherine Rutherford.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.866
She worked as a nurse at the
university clinic.

34:03.866 --> 34:07.811
Now, we have reason to believe
that someone in your class...

34:07.811 --> 34:11.282
possibly somebody in this room...
might be involved.

34:11.282 --> 34:12.804
We're looking for information.

34:12.804 --> 34:15.560
If anyone knows anyone who
might have had a grudge

34:15.560 --> 34:19.065
against Mrs. Rutherford
either now or in the past

34:19.065 --> 34:26.074
or someone who might be missing
their reunion lapel pin, the alumni reunion...

34:34.389 --> 34:35.719
All right.
Hey, hey, hey.

34:35.719 --> 34:37.760
Settle down.
Settle down, everybody.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.938
This... this is completely out
of context.

34:40.938 --> 34:45.129
You can't tell the whole story
from one photograph.

34:52.141 --> 34:53.905
You didn't have a permit.

34:53.905 --> 34:55.735
Yes, we did.

34:56.853 --> 34:59.583
It expired at noon.

35:01.673 --> 35:04.133
It was 12:06.

35:05.831 --> 35:09.145
Like I said, it expired at noon.

35:11.179 --> 35:13.407
Okay, come down.

35:13.961 --> 35:16.241
Are you all right?

35:17.705 --> 35:19.608
I'm gonna take her back
to the hotel.

35:19.608 --> 35:20.800
Is she all right?

35:20.800 --> 35:22.796
Yes, she's been feeling a little
depressed lately.

35:22.796 --> 35:25.987
I'm gonna have her lie down
and we'll be back for the last dance.

35:27.076 --> 35:33.484
Thank you for your, uh, help.

35:34.568 --> 35:36.071
Thank you.

35:38.798 --> 35:41.374
You forgot to give them
the toll free number.

35:41.849 --> 35:45.627
You know, I don't think we're gonna get
any hot leads from this group, Randy.

35:45.627 --> 35:46.909
Shoot.

35:46.909 --> 35:50.350
Diane's earrings.
I forgot to give them back.

35:53.137 --> 35:55.592
Hang on a second.

36:03.361 --> 36:06.175
What do you think?

36:06.175 --> 36:08.175
Well, it looks like they're from
the same set.

36:08.175 --> 36:11.183
I mean, they match perfectly.

36:11.183 --> 36:14.408
- Whose earrings are these?
- Diane Brooks.

36:14.408 --> 36:16.704
She and her husband left
about a half an hour ago.

36:16.704 --> 36:19.656
He said she was depressed.
He's been saying that all week.

36:19.656 --> 36:23.205
- Were they in town Friday night?
- Um... yeah, they got in the day before.

36:23.205 --> 36:25.416
Oh, my God.

36:25.416 --> 36:28.000
Captain, I think Diane is in danger.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.707
I think her husband...
is planning to kill her... tonight.

36:38.975 --> 36:40.892
- Mr. Monk, what's going on?
- Okay, I have a theory.

36:40.892 --> 36:44.265
It's completely crazy,
but it would explain everything.

36:44.265 --> 36:46.708
Kyle and Diane moved recently.

36:46.708 --> 36:50.751
At some point, Kyle must have
found some of her old papers...

36:50.751 --> 36:55.621
personal papers... including
the suicide note she wrote 25 years ago.

36:55.621 --> 36:56.921
Her suicide note?

36:56.921 --> 37:01.778
He realized that with that note,
he could kill his wife with impunity.

37:01.778 --> 37:05.115
It was in her handwriting.
Nobody would ever question it.

37:05.115 --> 37:06.478
"The depression is overwhelming.

37:06.478 --> 37:07.871
Give Tangerine a good home.
No relief.

37:07.871 --> 37:11.299
Even today I was eating at
Rocco's with Adrian and Trudy.

37:11.299 --> 37:14.573
Breaking that glass in the quad
today felt like the final straw."

37:14.573 --> 37:16.395
But he had one problem.

37:16.395 --> 37:19.084
Because the note was
25 years old,

37:19.084 --> 37:22.782
obviously, there were a couple of things
in it that were no longer true.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.987
- Like the name of her dog.
- Exactly, and breaking that glass.

37:25.987 --> 37:28.392
And eating at the restaurant
"with Adrian and Trudy."

37:28.392 --> 37:29.934
That's what he was
doing all weekend.

37:29.934 --> 37:33.846
He was recreating parts of her life
to match that suicide note.

37:33.846 --> 37:35.574
So when we found out,
we wouldn't be suspicious.

37:35.574 --> 37:37.589
- Why did he kill the nurse?
- He had no choice.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.151
Katherine Rutherford read that
note 25 years ago.

37:40.151 --> 37:42.131
It would have been made public.
She would have recognized it.

37:42.131 --> 37:44.163
Oh, my God, Mr. Monk,
he could be doing it right now.

37:44.163 --> 37:46.298
Registration sheets are all gone.

37:46.582 --> 37:48.555
Monk, do you have
a cell phone number? / No.

37:48.555 --> 37:50.967
- Do you know where they stayed?
- Some hotel.

37:50.967 --> 37:53.730
There are over 200 hotels
in this city, Monk.

37:53.730 --> 37:57.236
It'll take us over five hours to
check them all.

37:57.921 --> 37:59.792
Hold on.

37:59.792 --> 38:02.543
Hold on.

38:08.618 --> 38:10.052
What's he doing?

38:10.052 --> 38:12.530
I don't know.
What are you doing?

38:12.530 --> 38:17.395
The hotel where they're staying.
It was on the registration form.

38:17.395 --> 38:19.675
Yeah, so?

38:19.675 --> 38:21.623
When Diane signed in...

38:21.623 --> 38:24.536
We were standing in line.
She wrote...

38:25.989 --> 38:28.538
She wrote on my back.

38:30.766 --> 38:34.077
Can he do that? / That's how he
met Trudy. It's his superpower.

38:34.077 --> 38:35.593
Oh.

38:35.998 --> 38:39.426
There's her name.
Home address.

38:39.426 --> 38:41.990
Okay, Mr. Monk
it was near the bottom.

38:42.631 --> 38:47.149
She has terrible penmanship.
Why did it have to be cursive?

38:47.149 --> 38:50.285
Oh, oh.

38:50.285 --> 38:51.816
She ordered the prime rib,
medium rare.

38:51.816 --> 38:54.100
Keep going.
It's just below that.

38:58.111 --> 39:02.511
Yeah, there's an L.
Uh... L, E.

39:02.511 --> 39:05.426
- Lexus! Is there a Lexus Hotel?
- No, that was the car they drove, Monk.

39:05.426 --> 39:06.899
- Keep going.
- Oh, oh, oh.

39:08.784 --> 39:15.566
Uh, there's a P. P... no, P.
B, B, B!  / B?

39:15.566 --> 39:19.790
It's a B, it's a B, it's a B,
it's a B. B, B... L. L.

39:19.790 --> 39:23.500
Bl...  Bla... Bluh...

39:23.500 --> 39:26.024
- A. The Bla...
- The Blaza! Pl...Pl...Plaza.

39:26.024 --> 39:29.991
B... L... A... Y....
The Bla... the Bla...

39:29.991 --> 39:32.083
The Blakemore Hotel.

39:32.083 --> 39:34.084
That's right up the street.

39:36.521 --> 39:38.611
Don't fight it.

39:40.147 --> 39:42.325
No!

39:48.719 --> 39:50.322
Let go.

39:52.593 --> 39:54.617
Grab her. Grab her. Grab her!

39:55.617 --> 39:59.081
It's okay, it's okay.
It's all over.

40:16.792 --> 40:20.477
Here's the note.
I found it on the desk.

40:30.007 --> 40:32.299
What?

41:15.719 --> 41:18.688
Trudy, I just...

41:18.688 --> 41:22.273
There's something...

41:25.404 --> 41:28.066
I love you.

41:28.066 --> 41:31.239
Then we're in big trouble.

41:31.239 --> 41:34.371
I love you too.
