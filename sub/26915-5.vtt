00:14.556 --> 00:16.307
[croaking]

00:22.021 --> 00:23.523
Here, let me help you.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.693
Don't worry.
You don't have to do it by yourself!

00:26.860 --> 00:27.777
Thank you.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.698
I'm a little anxious
about getting everything done on time.

00:32.198 --> 00:36.161
It's a big day, but that's why
we have all Ponysitters' hands on deck!

00:36.703 --> 00:39.247
How did everything work with the flyers?

00:39.330 --> 00:41.875
Oh, all done!
I even made them double-sided

00:41.958 --> 00:45.170
so we cross-promote the Pet Adoption
and the Vaccination Drive.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.465
-Were you able to--?
-We did a final drop around town

00:48.548 --> 00:50.592
to ensure everyone's coming today.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.010
-Great!
-[phone ringing]

00:52.093 --> 00:55.972
Hey... the last truck of animals
for the Pet Adoption has arrived.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.266
-Awesome, right?
-Perfect.

00:58.349 --> 01:01.144
-I guess I'd better--
-Come on, Ponysitters!

01:01.227 --> 01:02.395
[Olivia laughs]

01:03.354 --> 01:05.523
Today's going smoother than I thought.

01:06.066 --> 01:10.403
I was nervous that two events in one day
might not have been the best idea.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.572
Honestly? Me, too.

01:12.947 --> 01:16.159
But a whole day dedicated
to finding animals new homes

01:16.242 --> 01:19.370
and staying healthy,
all the hard work is worth it.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.331
And it's gonna be a lot of fun!

01:22.373 --> 01:24.542
Um, where does the gecko go?

01:25.084 --> 01:28.254
Put it on that table by the window.
That's a warm spot.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.676
It looks like the Ponysitters
have everything under control.

01:34.469 --> 01:38.306
You bet we do. Uh, don't worry.
We'll finish the setup from here.

01:38.848 --> 01:42.811
All right. Better get going.
Mom and Dr. Singh will be expecting me.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.438
Great work, everyone.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.108
I can tell today is going to be a success.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.069
Never fear, Bianca is here.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.821
Bianca?

01:52.904 --> 01:55.824
Oh, right! Thank you for coming.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.325
Oh, no, no, no.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.787
Thank you for bringing in
a seasoned professional

02:00.870 --> 02:05.291
to ensure this Animal Auction
is a success.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.002
-It's a pet adoption.
-Right.

02:08.753 --> 02:13.716

[Ethan] Hey, Kyle.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.878
-We're not quite set up.
-[bleats]

02:50.128 --> 02:53.715
I know, but I couldn't wait any longer.
I was too excited.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.092
It's not every day you meet
your new best friend.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.010
[bleats]

02:57.093 --> 03:00.763
I even made-- I even made him a toy.
Do you think he'll like it?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.600
It might depend on who you adopt.
[chuckles]

03:05.018 --> 03:07.437
-[bleating]
-[Isabella] Gary likes it.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.771
[chuckles]

03:08.855 --> 03:12.108
If you aren't set up,
I'll catch you later. I'll be back.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.735
Bye, Kyle!

03:13.818 --> 03:14.903
-Bye!
-[Kyle] Bye.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.947
-Come on, Gary. Get in here.
-[bleats]

03:19.032 --> 03:20.325
[car honking]

03:21.492 --> 03:23.870
Anything else you need before we start?

03:23.953 --> 03:25.455
I think we're all set!

03:25.747 --> 03:29.208
We have our patient information
and sign-in sheets ready.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.336
The treats are ready to go out.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.423
And our donation jar for those
who can contribute to rescue efforts.

03:36.466 --> 03:40.428
These are so cute!
Pet-sized and human-sized.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.555
I know. I couldn't resist.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.808
Humans and pets deserve a treat
for keeping up their vaccinations.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.770
And as veterinarians
and volunteers, right?

03:49.812 --> 03:53.608
Dr Singh, I wanted to ask you
something about the vaccination shots.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.276
Shoot. [laughs]

03:55.360 --> 03:57.612
[laughter]

03:57.695 --> 03:58.613
Funny, right?

03:58.696 --> 04:00.740
I see what you did there.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.077
I wonder if I could watch you
give some of the shots.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.664
I mean, I know they're not all shots.
Some are nasal drops.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.624
Nasal drops are usually...?

04:09.832 --> 04:11.834
To prevent kennel cough in dogs?

04:12.126 --> 04:14.963
Nice. You've really been paying attention.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.674
You can watch
when we find a happy candidate.

04:18.174 --> 04:22.387
I hope it's okay, I put out flyers
for Rescue Ranch and the Pet Adoption.

04:22.470 --> 04:27.308
Great. I'm so glad we're working together
to spread the word and keep pets healthy.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.393
[chuckling]

04:28.476 --> 04:31.396
Okay, now I guess now we just wait.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.733
I have to admit, I was hoping
there would be more people here.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.027
Maybe we should unlock the door?

04:39.153 --> 04:42.198
Yes. That would help! [chuckles]

04:42.282 --> 04:44.742
[dog barking]

04:47.954 --> 04:50.164
Shelby, dear,

04:50.248 --> 04:52.625
can't you put on a more exciting video?

04:52.709 --> 04:55.044
You need to catch people's attention.

04:55.461 --> 04:59.382
-This one's... [sighs] terribly dull.
-[horse whinnies]

04:59.465 --> 05:01.759
This is a live video from the Ranch.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.637
People want to see
actual horses in action.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.556
See? There's Puzzle.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.683
In action?

05:08.766 --> 05:11.561
[chuckles]
It looks more like slow motion.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.815
Bianca, people are starting to arrive.
Why don't you go welcome them?

05:15.898 --> 05:18.401
-[gasps] Oh.
-[gloves snapping]

05:19.277 --> 05:21.070
[groans, grumbles]

05:23.072 --> 05:25.241
Oh, welcome. Welcome.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.784
Uh, this way!

05:27.327 --> 05:28.953
-Hey! I'm back.
-Oh!

05:29.037 --> 05:31.748
Do you want to help me find
my new furry friend?

05:32.081 --> 05:35.084
Sure. What four-legged friend
were you thinking of?

05:35.168 --> 05:39.756
Well, my parents did say I had to adopt
a pet that wasn't too much work.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.550
So I was thinking... rabbits.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.219
You've come to the fur-fect place!
[chuckles]

05:45.428 --> 05:47.638
-Right this way.
-Okay, sure.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.932
Oh. What's this guy's name?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.601
Ethan, Kyle, this is Ralph.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.728
Hi, Ralph.

05:57.940 --> 05:58.941
Hello.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.945
[sniffles] Aren't-- aren't you just...

06:03.905 --> 06:05.239
[sniffles, stammers]

06:05.323 --> 06:06.491
[sneezes]

06:06.574 --> 06:07.784
Are you okay?

06:07.992 --> 06:10.078
Yeah, I-I think so.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.538
Yep. [sneezes]

06:14.665 --> 06:17.085
Maybe you're allergic to rabbits.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.797
Uh, maybe just a-- [sneezes]

06:20.880 --> 06:22.423
M-maybe just a little.

06:23.007 --> 06:26.260
I think holding him
is one step too far for my allergies.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.638
[sneezes]

06:31.849 --> 06:34.852
Maybe you should hold this.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.980
-Thanks.
-[Trish] Don't worry.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.025
We've got other great pets
we can introduce you to.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.321
[panting]

06:49.909 --> 06:51.661
[panting]

06:53.788 --> 06:57.083
I'm sorry for the wait.
It should only be a few minutes.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.338
Wow, what a great turnout.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.382
I know. It's amazing, right?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.759
Keep moving. I can take the next patient.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.095
-Okay.
-[dog whimpering]

07:10.471 --> 07:11.556
Thank you.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.642
Jelly. I'm ready for you.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.271
-Wow, such a beauty.
-[dog whining]

07:21.816 --> 07:24.819
Mom, some of the patients
are getting restless.

07:25.027 --> 07:27.280
I know. Dr Singh's going as fast
as she can.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.741
Remember when I was little,
you used to make up games

07:30.825 --> 07:32.452
to play when I had to wait?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.620
Maybe there's something we can do.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.831
Like a grooming station.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.001
Oh, that's a great idea!
Hey, I have my camera too.

07:40.084 --> 07:44.172
I was gonna take photos for Rescue Ranch.
We could set up some kind of...

07:44.255 --> 07:45.548
A photo booth!

07:45.715 --> 07:47.216
[both] Yes!

08:09.197 --> 08:11.073
[crunching]

08:22.668 --> 08:23.669
[sighs]

08:23.753 --> 08:26.380
I-I'm sorry.
Just excuse us for one moment.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.423
Bianca!

08:27.673 --> 08:29.550
That couple was looking
at the guinea pigs.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.760
Oh.

08:31.260 --> 08:34.514
Well, can't we jazz them up?
You've seen the videos.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.391
No one can resist a dog wearing slippers,

08:37.475 --> 08:41.896
or-- or a cat riding around
on one of those robot vacuums!

08:41.979 --> 08:45.024
Oh, it's just hilarious! [laughs]

08:45.358 --> 08:48.778
-Can we get one to do that?
-No, no, no, no. Definitely not.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.196
Darn.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.823
-This will have to do.
-Oh, no, no, no.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.952
Bianca, it's important
that we don't interfere with--

08:56.035 --> 08:58.120
-Um, Mom?
-Oh!

08:58.579 --> 08:59.997
What is this?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.875
All the best events have cupcake towers.

09:02.959 --> 09:06.254
Aw, and look,
I had little paw prints put on them.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.090
Ah, the customers will love them.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.260
What we really want
is for people to love the animals.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.262
My arms are shaking!

09:14.345 --> 09:17.306
Oh, let me move this cage out of the way.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.017
The cupcakes will look stunning
next to the window.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.353
No, no. That's where the gecko is!

09:23.646 --> 09:25.439
Oh, perfect!

09:26.566 --> 09:29.277
Dr Singh is a wonderful vet.

09:29.443 --> 09:30.820
Thank you so much.

09:36.033 --> 09:39.996
Hey, Isabella.
So it turns out, I'm allergic to rabbits.

09:40.371 --> 09:44.292
-So I was thinking, could we try dogs?
-[dog barking]

09:44.542 --> 09:47.128
Dogs are really different than rabbits.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.005
-[dog barking]
-You're cute.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.840
-Yes, you are.
-[dog whining]

09:50.923 --> 09:52.883
-You're a good girl.
-[dog barks]

09:53.426 --> 09:55.678
Oh! My sniffles have disappeared!

09:56.012 --> 09:57.930
[barking]

09:58.014 --> 10:00.683
Whoa, she sure has a lot of energy.

10:01.017 --> 10:05.354
Yep. Unlike cats,
dogs need to go out three times a day.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.732
-[barking]
-Three times a day?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.151
Dogs need a lot of companionship.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.111
But I'm at school all day!

10:12.194 --> 10:15.865
I'm only home in the evenings,
and that's when I do my homework.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.201
Hmm, maybe we should start
thinking inside the box.

10:27.668 --> 10:32.006
This is so impressive. You guys make
waiting for the doctor so much fun.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.258
-Your next patient.
-Thank you.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.053
-And they're still coming.
-[Billy] Whew.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.262
Coby.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.514
-[dog barking]
-Come on in.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.897
Welcome to the clinic. I'm Billy.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.315
Uh, hi.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.943
-Who do you have here?
-This is Teddy.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.820
-[whimpers]
-[Billy] Hi, Teddy!

10:55.571 --> 10:59.241
Fill out some forms.
The doctor should be ready shortly.

10:59.659 --> 11:04.955
Oh, thanks, but I...
I left my wallet at home.

11:05.289 --> 11:09.293
[sighs] I just saw the balloons outside,
and I was curious.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.214
Not to worry. The drive is sponsored
by Rescue Ranch.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.174
There's no cost to you.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.301
When you're ready, come this way.

11:24.266 --> 11:29.021
That's Puzzle. He'll finish rehabilitation
in a month or two. Are you able to wait?

11:29.188 --> 11:32.358
No, I need to get a new horse settled in
before that.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.361
I don't want my mare alone
longer than necessary.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.823
Oh, well... Winston.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.660
Winston's been with us a month.
He has a sweet disposition.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.453
-He'd be an excellent--
-The best!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.956
He can do anything, anything you like.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.333
Yes, Winston is a wonderful horse,

11:49.417 --> 11:52.086
but you have to keep in mind
that he's blind.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.131
[laughs] Trish!

11:55.589 --> 11:58.843
Why would this man want a blind horse?

11:58.926 --> 12:02.930
Actually, I'm hoping to find
a companion horse for my mare.

12:04.140 --> 12:08.561
With Winston's even temperament,
it sounds like he could be a good fit.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.106
Great, when would you like
to come and meet Winston?

12:12.731 --> 12:14.525
-Tomorrow?
-Sure.

12:14.817 --> 12:19.613
And I'd like to bring the mare along too,
to make sure they're a good match.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.909
Perfect. We'll see you both
tomorrow morning, bright and early.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.089
-[Teddy barking]
-Teddy!

12:38.007 --> 12:39.633
-Oh, hi!
-Teddy!

12:39.717 --> 12:40.551
Sorry.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.804
No worries. I love furry welcomes.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.182
Hi, I'm Skye.

12:46.765 --> 12:47.892
Jenny.

12:48.559 --> 12:52.813
Well, uh, we have tons of ribbons
and brushes.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.192
Uh, it looks like Teddy
could use a good brush.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.068
How long have you had him?

12:58.861 --> 13:02.698
For as long as I can remember.
We've been through a lot together.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.494
-He's my best friend.
-He seems like a great dog.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.370
Do you have a dog?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.790
Um, no dogs right now,

13:11.874 --> 13:16.003
but I live at Rescue Ranch,
so we have all kinds of animals.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.713
I have a horse named Puzzle.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.924
You have a horse?

13:20.299 --> 13:22.343
Yes, and no.

13:22.426 --> 13:26.847
Um... my Mom says we have to adopt out
all of our rescues.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.308
But Puzzle is special to me.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.895
I just I hope he doesn't get
adopted anytime soon.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.021
I really love him.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.692
I'm trying to convince Mom
I'd be the perfect owner.

13:39.193 --> 13:43.405
Good luck.
Uh... moms can be tough sometimes.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.575
I know it. [chuckles]

13:48.786 --> 13:51.247
-You don't keep the animals?
-[Teddy moans]

13:51.330 --> 13:54.416
[chuckles] No, um...

13:54.500 --> 13:57.211
We keep them for a little while,

13:57.294 --> 14:00.047
but everyone deserves to find a real home.

14:01.257 --> 14:05.594
Sometimes people aren't able to care
for animals or give them what they need,

14:05.678 --> 14:08.889
so they come to us
and we give them to the new families.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.809
You and Teddy should come sometime.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.852
Yeah.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.400
[squeaking]

14:26.657 --> 14:27.616
Um...

14:28.701 --> 14:31.120
-[croaks]
-I don't know about a gecko.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.665
Maybe I should get a goldfish
and call it a day.

14:35.165 --> 14:40.337
Goldfish need continuous care,
regular cleaning, water purification--

14:40.421 --> 14:41.839
Oh, forget it.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.509
Maybe I'm just not cut out
to be a pet owner.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.890
Kyle, wait.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.225
[sighs]

14:55.102 --> 14:55.936
What?

14:56.937 --> 14:59.398
Where's Magic?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.197
Jenny and Teddy?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.326
Jenny and Teddy?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.996
They were here a minute ago.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.414
Oh, what happened?

15:17.291 --> 15:18.250
Okay.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.089
Where could he be?

15:26.550 --> 15:29.595
-[bleating]
-[Ethan] Magic. Magic?

15:29.678 --> 15:31.055
-[clatters]
-[bleating]

15:31.138 --> 15:32.181
Where could he be?

15:34.099 --> 15:35.809
Gary! Who let you out?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.438
Oh, not my cupcake tower!

15:40.230 --> 15:42.816
Oh, my cupcake tower! Oh!

15:43.567 --> 15:44.610
[Gary bleating]

15:44.693 --> 15:47.529
Here, Trish. You can take this.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.989
I'm never gonna use it.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.618
Maybe one other animal will like it.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.790
[dogs barking]

15:57.957 --> 15:59.208
Jenny, wait!

15:59.416 --> 16:03.295
Thanks for the dog treats and brush,
but we've got to get going.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.799
I took extra treats for Teddy.
I hope that's okay.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.843
But Teddy didn't get his vaccination yet.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.221
If you and Teddy need help--

16:12.304 --> 16:15.349
Look, we don't have a lot of money,

16:15.432 --> 16:19.645
but we don't need to be rescued.
I'll never give Teddy to another home.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.856
We would never want you
to give Teddy away.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.984
He has an owner who loves him.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.487
Rescue Ranch
isn't just about helping the animals.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.906
It's about helping each other, too.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.867
It takes a village to raise an animal.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.287
You don't have to do it on your own.
We can help.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.539
Really?

16:39.790 --> 16:42.751
I haven't been able to afford
to get Teddy vaccinated.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.421
Why don't we focus on this one?

16:45.504 --> 16:49.550
We can work together to make sure
Teddy stays healthy for the future.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.178
You should definitely
stop by the Ranch. For fun.

16:53.721 --> 16:58.600
We have big fields for Teddy to run in,
and a doggie pool for bubble baths.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.520
-Grandpa makes delicious grilled cheese.
-Mmm.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.356
You should definitely stop by.
Whenever you want.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.027
-Don't wanna meet Puzzle?
-[Teddy whimpers]

17:08.110 --> 17:10.821
I think Teddy and I would like that
very much.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.412
[indistinct chatter]

17:23.459 --> 17:26.045
-Come on, Gary. Ugh, go.
-[bleats]

17:26.128 --> 17:29.840
There is... no more cupcakes.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.384
Goats shouldn't eat cupcakes.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.762
It's ruined.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.973
All of my hard work, and...

17:38.307 --> 17:39.683
and it's ruined!

17:40.267 --> 17:41.518
Bianca...

17:41.935 --> 17:45.898
I think you're maybe a little too focused
on the wrong things here.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.151
Look around you.
Pet Adoption Day is a huge success.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.655
-It is?
-Yes, yes. Of course it is.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.575
Today is about matching animals
with loving homes.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.786
That's why people are here.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.037
For the animals.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.165
Not for cupcakes or fancy drapes.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.626
Okay, animals.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.505
Your guardian angel is here.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.801
[goat bleating]

18:14.676 --> 18:17.387
Ready, Teddy? See what I did there?

18:17.679 --> 18:20.599
[clicks tongue]
Ah, a veterinarian and a comedian!

18:20.682 --> 18:22.434
And I keep my promises.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.896
Would you give permission
to observe Teddy's treatment?

18:25.979 --> 18:28.941
-Sure. Everybody needs to learn.
-Thank you.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.651
Perfect. Follow me.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.782
-[squeaking]
-[Kyle] Do you like that toy?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.451
You can have it. I don't need it anymore.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.746
-You're a funny little guy.
-[squeaking]

18:48.544 --> 18:50.045
There you are, Magic!

18:50.254 --> 18:53.549
-[sighs] Back we go, mister.
-Hey, does he have to go now?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.717
We're getting to know each other.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.637
Have you ever considered a pet rat, Kyle?

18:58.929 --> 19:01.723
Truthfully, no.
I started off thinking rabbits.

19:02.057 --> 19:06.228
I wasn't a big fan of rats until recently.
I hear they make great pets.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.898
They're very intelligent and clean.
And they're nocturnal.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.277
They sleep when you're at school
and play when you get home.

19:14.194 --> 19:18.282
But keep an eye on Magic
because he's a bit of an escape artist.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.867
I love Magic!

19:20.617 --> 19:22.161
Really? Me, too!

19:22.327 --> 19:23.162
See?

19:23.537 --> 19:26.415
-Ta-da!
-Ah! That was funny!

I'm really going to miss Winston.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.345
Me, too, but I'll be happy
if he makes friends.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.144
Should've seen how happy Kyle was
when he found Magic.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.772
They were the perfect pair!

20:31.855 --> 20:35.651
We had some pretty magical moments
at the Vaccination Drive, too.

20:35.734 --> 20:39.488
But did Puzzle get adopted?
I-I just-- I can't lose him.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.909
Definitely not. We checked Shelby's list.
Nobody's coming to see him.

20:43.992 --> 20:48.705
Shelby said people picked other horses
instead of waiting for his rehab.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.209
Thank goodness. That means
I still have a chance to keep him.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.337
So, how did everything go?

20:55.629 --> 20:56.964
[groans] Well...

20:57.047 --> 20:59.258
It was a huge success!

20:59.341 --> 21:01.301
Most of the animals found homes.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.012
-Hmm.
-Yes, but not all of them.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.390
They still have a home at Rescue Ranch.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.307
[Bianca] Good.

21:07.391 --> 21:11.561
Oh, and I do have some great ideas
for next "Pet Search and Find"!

21:11.645 --> 21:12.604
[all chuckling]

21:12.688 --> 21:15.357
No cupcakes involved.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.276
-I promise.
-[laughs]

21:17.359 --> 21:19.486
-[Gary bleating]
-Oh, no, no, Gary!

21:19.569 --> 21:22.155
You know you can't eat
any of those cupcakes.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.115
[bleats]

21:23.198 --> 21:25.617
We are always happy to have helping hands!

21:25.701 --> 21:28.912
-Should we pack up the drapes?
-Yes, you should.

21:29.997 --> 21:30.831
[sighs]

21:31.832 --> 21:33.208
I'm sorry, girls.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.878
It would be very nice
if you could pack up the drapes.

21:37.421 --> 21:41.091
-I'll deal with the cupcake aftermath.
-It's our pleasure.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.884
-No problem.
-[Gary bleating]

21:43.885 --> 21:45.304
No, no. No, no, no, Gary!

21:45.387 --> 21:49.683
No, no, no, no. That's close enough! No!

21:49.766 --> 21:52.602
If you think you're going to eat
any cupcakes,

21:52.686 --> 21:54.896
then you are mistaken, mister!
