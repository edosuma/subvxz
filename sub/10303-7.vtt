01:16.040 --> 01:19.316
And now, stay tuned for the show
too good for television.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.755
- Wings?
- Wings!

01:22.000 --> 01:24.355
We now return to Wings.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.909
Our Wings marathon.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.914
Wings.

01:35.240 --> 01:39.518
I'd cancel my cable
if I wasn't stealing it from the D'Arcys.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.598
Hey, Dad.

01:44.640 --> 01:50.112
I've got a problem.
I did something really stupid.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.955
Well, son, you didn't marry, did you?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.593
God, no.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.308
No, I volunteered
for this program at college.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.193
They assign you community
service work for extra credit.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.073
Well, I was hoping to get
Save the Brazilian Rainforest.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.038
Why? What do you care?

02:07.640 --> 02:10.279
I wanted to see
naked women from Rio.

02:11.240 --> 02:15.028
Well, you can do that during
wet gaucho night at the nudie bar.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.838
Well, the Brazilian course
got filled by the football team...

02:19.080 --> 02:21.958
...so they assigned me to
the only charity they had left open.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.553
Which is?

02:24.960 --> 02:29.078
I can't even tell you.
It's too humiliating to talk about.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.392
I'm just thankful
the word hasn't hit the streets yet.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.672
Hey, Daddy, guess what.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.948
Bud has been assigned
to the Virgin Hotline.

02:43.280 --> 02:48.035
Well, we do know, however, that word
has hit the old mattress behind the Y.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.030
Virgin Hotline?
What the hell is a Virgin Hotline?

02:52.880 --> 02:54.472
Bud.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.796
Well, Dad,
you probably don't know this...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.355
...but today, there's a big movement
toward celibacy.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.068
Know it? Hell, I started it.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.190
No, Dad.
This is no sex before marriage.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.793
See, the hotline was set up...

03:09.000 --> 03:13.755
...so that when virgins felt in danger
of losing their innocence...

03:14.000 --> 03:15.672
...they could call someone to be...

03:15.920 --> 03:18.388
Nipped in the bud.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.393
Or counselled, for those of us
who breathe through our noses.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.392
Ask him what the phone number is,
Dad.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.269
Now, now, sweetheart, the least
we can be is a little sensitive here.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.273
What is the phone number, pumpkin?

03:33.840 --> 03:37.515
1-800-ZIPP-UP.

03:40.560 --> 03:46.590
Yeah, that's right, Gomer and Pyles.
Yuck it up.

03:46.840 --> 03:50.913
Now, if I can ask a favour,
can we please keep a lid on this one?

03:51.160 --> 03:53.833
My answering the phones
is gonna be completely anonymous...

03:54.080 --> 03:56.594
...and I'd just as soon
no one else knew it was me.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.153
Hey, Bud.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.075
I heard on the radio.
You're on the Virgin Hotline.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.391
They said Bud's name on the radio?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.835
Well, actually, it was a jingle.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.957
Let me see, how did it go?

04:10.200 --> 04:13.636
If you're a virgin
With hormones surging

04:13.880 --> 04:18.430
Keep on your undies
And call Bud Bundy's

04:23.520 --> 04:26.432
Virgin Hotline

04:26.680 --> 04:28.511
That's catchy.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.759
Thank you.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.672
And with self-esteem intact...

04:32.920 --> 04:35.115
...I'm gonna get ready
for my orientation now.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.759
Kelly.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.554
Would you be kind
as to insult me up the stairs, please?

04:39.760 --> 04:41.113
My pleasure.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.750
Now, when people call up,
do you merely talk them out of sex...

04:45.000 --> 04:47.070
...or do you send them
a picture of yourself...

04:47.280 --> 04:48.918
...and scare the pants back on them?

04:50.640 --> 04:52.517
Hey, Al, guess what.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.228
They're having a sale
at the video store.

04:55.480 --> 04:58.313
See? Right here.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.839
So, what do I care?
Then go to the video store.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.559
Well, I want you to come with me.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.433
Oh, no.
That's why we have cable, Peg.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.353
You can see the best
and never leave your house. Watch.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.875
Tonight, Tom Selleck in
Mr. Baseball.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.680
Then John Goodman is King Ralph.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.593
But first, Wings.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.996
I'll drive.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.478
Hey, you guys mind if I hang out?

05:28.720 --> 05:33.032
If I go home, Marcie will know I'm not
at my Unemployed Anonymous meeting.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.990
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.715
Welcome to The Naked
Jell-O-Wrestling Championship.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.996
Hey, that's a...

05:59.160 --> 06:04.314
Hi. I'm here for the Virgin Hotline.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.472
- I'm...
- Bud Bundy. I know.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.312
Your face has chastity
written all over it.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.795
Really? Damn Kelly.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.431
My name is Ms. Hardway.
I am the founder of Virgin Hotline.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.035
Not that I haven't had opportunities.

06:23.280 --> 06:26.397
It's just that I prefer to
save myself for marriage.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.038
Whose?

06:32.720 --> 06:35.439
People don't understand
virgins these days, Mr. Bundy.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.753
They don't realize that we can have
just as much fun as they do...

06:40.000 --> 06:43.117
...while remaining vertical,
with our toes uncurled...

06:43.360 --> 06:49.230
...and the saliva of our passions held
firmly in our proud, unsullied mouths.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.790
And there are so many more exciting
things to do besides having sex.

06:59.040 --> 07:03.352
Have you ever felt the soft down
of a newborn baby duck?

07:03.960 --> 07:07.270
Ever collect little ceramic unicorns?

07:07.520 --> 07:09.033
Ever play Yahtzee?

07:10.640 --> 07:12.198
No, you see, I'm not a virgin.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.111
Oh, come now, Mr. Bundy.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.669
Here is your Virgin Hotline
handbook.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.559
Memorize its pithy wisdom.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.913
"Reach out and touch yourself"?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.591
I love the '90s.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.435
Time to take calls. You man line one.
It's our busiest.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.398
And remember, Mr. Bundy...

07:38.640 --> 07:41.473
...you will be counselling these people
in their weakest moment.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.838
You must be their shelter in a storm,
their anchor in rough seas.

07:46.320 --> 07:50.916
Their cold shower during heavy
Jimmy Smits reruns of L.A. Law.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.913
You, Mr. Bundy,
are their last line of defence.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.388
Can you do it?

07:58.240 --> 08:01.357
You know,
with a little more mak eup...

08:01.600 --> 08:05.718
...and her hair done
and some soft music...

08:09.120 --> 08:11.236
Mr. Bundy?

08:13.240 --> 08:14.434
Can you do it?

08:14.680 --> 08:17.592
Well, if the room was real dark,
I might...

08:21.520 --> 08:25.069
Oh, you mean the phones.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.312
Yeah, I can do the phones.
No problem.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.752
Watch.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.758
Hello, you're on the Virgin Hotline.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.470
This is your counsellor, Eugene.

08:38.080 --> 08:43.029
Hi. My name is Isis J. Blowup Doll.

08:45.720 --> 08:50.077
And my boyfriend, Bud, hasn't been
able to k eep his hands off me...

08:50.320 --> 08:53.118
...ever since I came out of the box.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.717
Now, should I try to stay firm...

08:57.960 --> 09:02.033
...or just explode and go to pieces?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.840
Very funny, Kel,
but don't let me keep you.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.038
I'm sure the trucker paid
for the whole hour.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.677
Crank call.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.595
Yes, we occasionally get those too.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.469
Usually from mean people
who have had sex.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.996
But remember, Mr. Bundy,
they mock us because they envy us.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.556
Yeah, right.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.759
Virgin Hotline.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.633
Hi, this is Buck.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.796
I'm wearing nothing but my fur.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.395
I miss you, Bud.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.515
I miss our special times together.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.671
Kelly, Kelly, please!

10:07.000 --> 10:10.310
Oh, now, come now, Mr. Bundy.
Chin up.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.791
People used to call me
and say they were my showerhead.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.949
What's the matter, Kelly?
Is your bed closed for repairs?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.159
Is this the right number?

10:25.360 --> 10:29.035
My name is Esther and I thought
I was calling the Virgin Hotline.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.953
Really? This is a real call.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.310
Yeah, you're on the Virgin Hotline.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.437
I've been trying to wait
until marriage...

10:36.680 --> 10:39.717
...but everywhere you look
is sex, sex, sex.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.952
Well, where exactly are you?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.112
Home, watching TV.

10:47.360 --> 10:51.751
Oh, God, they're doing
a Bugle Boy jeans commercial.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.597
Oh, you're losing her, Mr. Bundy.
Quick, do a TV talk-down.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.159
TV talk-down?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.356
Okay, Esther, now, listen to me.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.795
We're gonna have to
take your mind off of sex.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.595
Now think of the guy
from the Zima commercials.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.673
I can't.
Now Melrose Place is coming on.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.954
Billy's taking his shirt off.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.078
Mr. Bundy, we have a code red.
We're going to have to act fast.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.271
I'll keep her talking.
You go to her house.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.397
- What?
- Don't argue. Take your handbook...

11:21.600 --> 11:24.910
...and your "Never Had It, Never Will"
Virgin Hotline cap.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.638
Hurry, or I'm gonna have to
call my boyfriend.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.917
Take my car.
I'll call with the address.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.830
And, Bud,
you have a really cute tush.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.954
It's Friday night
and what am I doing?

11:49.200 --> 11:51.919
Talking a girl out of sex.

11:53.080 --> 11:57.596
Oh, my God.
I am my father's Oldsmobile.

11:59.280 --> 12:03.193
Well, let's get this over with.

12:05.840 --> 12:10.356
Esther. With a name like that,
I should have brought a chew toy.

12:16.320 --> 12:20.199
Hi. I'm Esther. Save me.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.874
Now, all we have to do is find
one movie that we can both watch.

12:47.320 --> 12:53.316
Hey, here's one.
Die, Scum-sucking Pig, Die.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.512
Ray Walston and Sherman Hemsley
in a haunted house, Peg.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.350
Al, you have rented that
25 times already.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.114
Well, it's good.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.636
Oh, how about this?
Four Weddings and a Funeral.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.713
That's kind of like five
of the same thing, isn't it?

13:12.920 --> 13:16.230
Hey, how about
WrestleMania bloopers?

13:17.120 --> 13:19.953
You could have taped
our honeymoon for that.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.111
You know, Al, maybe you should
go your way and I'll go mine.

13:24.720 --> 13:29.669
Really? After all these years?
Thank you, Peg.

13:30.920 --> 13:34.435
No, I mean in the video store.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.435
Now go find a movie we can both enjoy,
and be serious, Al.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.990
Hey, Dorf on Skiing.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.352
So. Virgin, huh?

13:48.600 --> 13:52.479
I just can't tell you how tough it is
for a woman to maintain her chastity.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.996
Every single girl I know
is just preoccupied with sex.

13:56.240 --> 14:01.997
They'll have it with anyone,
anywhere, anytime.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.873
Really? Well, if you'd just give me
their names...

14:12.120 --> 14:16.193
...their photos
and their phone numbers...

14:17.040 --> 14:19.349
...I'll get to the bottom of them.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.553
I mean, of it. Bottom of it.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.394
No, Bud, please don't leave
before my mother gets home.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.076
If I take my eyes off you,
I know I'll get all horny again.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.548
I'm glad to be of service.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.236
Can I get you something to drink?

14:42.440 --> 14:47.798
Well, you got anything
fresh squeezed?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.079
I'll see.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.153
I'm really sorry to drag you out
on a Friday night like this...

14:53.400 --> 14:55.550
...but I can't tell you
how much I appreciate...

14:55.760 --> 14:57.671
...an organization like yours, Bud.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.229
I don't understand
what's wrong with the world.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.711
Everywhere you look, temptation.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.838
Zima guy, Zima guy.

15:14.080 --> 15:19.677
No, no, I mean, I mean,
I mean Roseanne, Roseanne.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.873
Peg.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.473
Diesel Head.

15:25.720 --> 15:30.157
"A man and a monster truck
exchange brains"?

15:32.320 --> 15:35.118
Like Emilio Estevez
would make a bad movie.

15:37.160 --> 15:41.278
Look, Al, you have said no
to every movie that I've chosen.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.432
Because every movie
you choose sucks.

15:44.680 --> 15:49.151
- Fried Green Tomatoes sucks?
- Yes.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.997
Now, look, obviously,
we are not gonna agree on anything.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.629
I mean, why should movies be
any different than sex?

15:57.880 --> 16:01.270
Well, can't eat popcorn
when you're having sex, Peg.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.873
Al, let's just find something
to please both of us...

16:05.120 --> 16:07.315
...and do not go
into the adult section.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.950
I don't even know
where the adult section is.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.550
Here are the classics.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.720
Schindler's Lust.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.435
Booty and the Beast.

16:27.520 --> 16:32.036
And my favourite, Forrest Hump.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.110
- Oh, excuse me.
- No problem.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.595
- Marcie!
- AI.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.119
It's not what you think.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.511
Well, that's good,
because I think I'm gonna heave.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.710
I've just been monitoring porn
for my women's group.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.832
We are sick of films that exploit
and degrade women...

16:59.080 --> 17:00.957
...and we are not going
to take it anymore.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.350
Here are the tapes you asked us
to hold for you.

17:03.560 --> 17:09.829
Silence of the Loins
and The Joy Slut Club.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.150
Shall I just charge those
to your house account?

17:14.440 --> 17:16.112
Fine.

17:16.800 --> 17:21.589
I'm taking these home to erase them.
That'll show you men.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.229
Do you have condoms?

17:25.440 --> 17:27.157
Oh, Al, look what I found.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.358
Lik e Water for Chocolate.
It's a love story.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.160
What a coincidence, Peg,
I found a love story too.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.914
Mrs. Assfire.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.713
- Water.
- Fire.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.148
- Water.
- Fire.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.839
All right, Al, that's it.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.877
You get what you want,
I'm going home.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.038
Oh, now, wait, Peg.
This could be good.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.273
Big 'Uns magazine guide
gives this two things up.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.158
Al, I am not checking out porn.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.429
Now, you would think that,
in a video store of 10,000 tapes...

18:02.640 --> 18:05.154
...we could find at least one movie
that we would like...

18:08.000 --> 18:10.309
Butch Cassidy.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.473
Oh, Al.
Now, here's a movie we can agree on.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.792
You remember when we were dating
and we saw this at the drive-in?

18:18.040 --> 18:21.032
I remember that we saw half of it.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.396
You know, I still have the imprint
of the Dodge logo on my back.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.076
I can't believe you still have that car.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.839
Well, I can't believe I still have you.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.796
- Where were we, Peg?
- Sharing a tender moment.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.268
Oh, yeah.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.318
You remember how they kicked us out
for making too much noise?

18:45.560 --> 18:47.790
Well, you were hurting me, Peg.

18:48.760 --> 18:54.232
Well, we certainly made up for it
that night, in my father's hall closet.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.435
- Oh, Al.
- Yeah?

18:57.680 --> 18:59.557
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

19:00.160 --> 19:02.390
Mrs. Assfire?

19:05.520 --> 19:08.080
- No.
- All right, Butch Cassidy it is.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.909
Oh, good.
I heard it has a happy ending.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.555
All right, spread them, thief.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.633
Look at that, Peg.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.950
You know, some people
just have no respect...

19:19.200 --> 19:21.430
...for the personal property of others.

19:21.640 --> 19:24.200
Nothing at all, I tell you.

19:27.640 --> 19:32.236
M-E-L-O-N-S. Melons.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.436
Your turn.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.393
So, what have you got?

19:44.640 --> 19:47.074
Nothing I can use.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.799
Hi, honey, I'm home.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.600
Hi, Mom. This is my new friend Bud.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.230
- He's from...
- I know. The Virgin Hotline.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.631
I saw your picture
on the side of a bus.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.508
Great. You wouldn't happen to know
where that bus is...

20:03.760 --> 20:05.637
...so I could throw myself
in front of it?

20:05.880 --> 20:07.916
Oh, they're everywhere, hon.

20:08.160 --> 20:12.233
And I'm so glad that you were here
to help Esther in her time of need.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.631
Now, young lady,
it's time for you to do your homework.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.075
Okay, Mom.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.515
And thank you, Bud.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.956
Keep in touch.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.314
Well, I didn't mean with me.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.516
I meant with herself.

20:31.240 --> 20:34.915
Well, not with herself,
with her schoolwork.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.990
- See you.
- Well, I'd like to thank you too, Bud.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.754
If there had been a Virgin Hotline
when I was her age...

20:42.000 --> 20:44.878
...I might have known
who her father was.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.350
Well, knowing who your father is
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.355
Is there any way I can repay you?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.556
No, ma'am, no.
No, according to the book...

20:55.760 --> 20:58.149
...we're not allowed
to take any kind of compensation.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.272
Even if it's these?

21:07.680 --> 21:10.114
Didn't say anything about tips.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.071
Mom, Dad, I'm going out!

21:26.720 --> 21:29.029
Mom? Dad?

21:31.840 --> 21:34.673
Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.559
Now, why would you rent a movie
and not watch it?

21:37.800 --> 21:41.429
It's like renting a hotel room
and not ripping off the honour bar.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.193
Old people do the dumbest things.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.512
Thank you.
