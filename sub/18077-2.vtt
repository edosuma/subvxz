<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:02.985 --> 00:04.571
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:04.696 --> 00:06.281
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:06.406 --> 00:07.533
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:07.658 --> 00:09.159
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:09.243 --> 00:10.744
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:10.828 --> 00:12.579
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:12.663 --> 00:14.540
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:14.623 --> 00:16.959
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:17.042 --> 00:18.335
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:18.418 --> 00:20.963
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:39.434 --> 02:42.312
Go too far down
this river, is me think.

02:42.938 --> 02:46.400
All this nonsense about El
Cajon, the river pirate.

02:46.483 --> 02:49.361
These people really believe
he's some kind of devil?

02:49.611 --> 02:53.073
A mystical creature who can walk
without one foot touching the ground.

02:53.365 --> 02:54.408
You gotta be kidding.

02:54.491 --> 02:57.703
El Cajon, he maketh no shadow.

02:57.786 --> 03:01.665
Death follow him
like silent friend.

03:01.790 --> 03:06.378
El Cajon has cobra and
moccasin around his neck.

03:06.628 --> 03:08.338
They fear to bite him.

03:08.505 --> 03:12.050
Look, our deal was you would take
me to the Jurua Tributary...

03:12.175 --> 03:15.971
and on past the settlement at Fonte Boa.
I paid you for that distance.

03:16.096 --> 03:20.267
That was before husband of me
sister had vision last night.

03:20.559 --> 03:24.896
Your brother-in-law chews cocoa leaves.
He's high. He's loaded.

03:25.022 --> 03:27.107
His pupils look like
train tunnels.

03:27.232 --> 03:30.110
He see tomorrow today.

03:30.527 --> 03:33.572
Ah, he's a little bit crazy,
me think.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.868
But he is listened by others.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.454
We're not turning back,
Little John.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.750
When we reach
bend in river, we see.

03:44.875 --> 03:46.835
That is me best think on it.

04:10.525 --> 04:14.279
You say to them that I know where
the lost city of Del Rio is.

04:16.406 --> 04:18.575
The religious artifacts,
they can have.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.036
The treasures of their
Peruvian Indians.

04:21.244 --> 04:23.622
Much magic. Okay?

04:24.664 --> 04:27.042
You and your family
be big medicine.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.294
Much magic.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.020
He want two thing.

04:47.145 --> 04:48.480
Okay. What?

04:48.605 --> 04:52.401
You will offer your hand
to El Cajon to save our lives.

04:53.402 --> 04:55.320
That's easy enough.
Sure. What else?

04:56.113 --> 04:59.032
He want good luck medal
from your neck.

04:59.324 --> 05:01.743
My girlfriend gave me
this St. Christopher.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.162
Kind of a pre-engagement gift.

05:04.287 --> 05:06.540
These things will take you
round bend in river.

05:06.665 --> 05:08.208
Nothing else.

05:33.150 --> 05:34.901
It will be safe now.

05:35.026 --> 05:36.778
I don't believe this.

05:56.465 --> 05:58.842
So, looks like El Cajon's...

05:58.967 --> 06:01.845
out scaring snakes on
another part of the river.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.894
El Cajon.

06:17.319 --> 06:19.237
Maintain your course.
We'll outrun him.

06:19.362 --> 06:20.739
No, you must stop.

06:21.031 --> 06:22.365
You will give him your hand.

06:22.491 --> 06:24.326
I don't think this guy
wants to shake hands.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.410
No shake hands.

06:25.535 --> 06:29.789
You will let him cut it off and you will
offer it as a gift to save our lives.

07:00.529 --> 07:02.322
Good morning, <i>señor</i>.

07:02.906 --> 07:05.784
You seem to be having
a bit of trouble.

07:06.368 --> 07:11.498
Perhaps for a small amount of
money I can give you a hand.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.209
I thought I was
supposed to give you mine.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.878
This is a very old
Indian custom.

07:17.212 --> 07:19.881
You give a hand
to protect your friends.

07:20.257 --> 07:24.427
Is very, very funny custom, no?

07:38.942 --> 07:42.279
Such is the legend of El Cajon.

07:42.362 --> 07:47.450
He will tell the others of the
man who walks on one leg.

07:51.288 --> 07:54.833
Perhaps a box of diamonds, eh?

07:55.125 --> 07:56.167
It's my journal.

07:56.251 --> 07:57.752
Your journal.

07:59.254 --> 08:01.298
Yes...

08:03.341 --> 08:06.011
very important, these words.

08:07.012 --> 08:08.847
Just my personal stuff.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.682
I see.

08:12.559 --> 08:16.980
It is about many women, eh?

08:17.105 --> 08:18.523
I think?

08:20.150 --> 08:23.403
I will read these words later.

08:52.140 --> 08:57.062
<i>Señor</i>, this is not the way for
friends to welcome each other...

08:57.187 --> 08:59.147
over the barrel of the pistola.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.358
You're not my friend, fatso.
Where's the rest of the money?

09:01.524 --> 09:04.653
Isn't it you who's
bringing the money to me?

09:04.903 --> 09:08.531
Does not your boss,
<i>Señor</i> Doylee, pay me...

09:08.657 --> 09:10.742
to keep people off the river?

09:10.825 --> 09:14.120
I'm through with you and I'm through
with Doyle. I want what you've got.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.541
My bad leg, she aches.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.127
May I sit down?

09:26.841 --> 09:31.763
The man who walks
with one foot get tired...

09:34.099 --> 09:35.472
somedays.

09:35.497 --> 09:38.520
You fat bucket of donkey sweat.
Where is it?

09:38.978 --> 09:42.399
You make a big mistake.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.528
It is a double barrel, <i>señor</i>.

09:46.695 --> 09:49.447
The man who walks on one leg...

09:49.948 --> 09:52.951
carries a shotgun in the other.

09:53.368 --> 09:55.704
Is good trick, no, eh?

09:58.957 --> 10:04.462
The fat bucket of donkey sweat
do it again, eh?

10:28.820 --> 10:32.866
And so the paper sent a stringer
down to Monte Alegre...

10:33.074 --> 10:36.286
which is a tiny town on the
Jurua tributary of the Amazon.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.914
There's a river Indian there, who
goes by the name of Little John.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.583
Little John.
I like that.

10:41.666 --> 10:45.587
He was in Brian's party,
and the only one to get away.

10:46.087 --> 10:48.423
Apparently their convoy
was attacked...

10:48.548 --> 10:51.050
by a river pirate
who goes by the name...

10:51.301 --> 10:52.635
of El Cajon.

10:52.719 --> 10:53.970
El Cajon?

10:54.137 --> 10:57.307
El Cajon? I think that's
a Spanish word, not a name.

10:57.932 --> 11:00.226
And you're engaged
to this Brian Lefcourt?

11:00.477 --> 11:01.978
Pre-engaged.

11:02.312 --> 11:04.314
We gave each other
these St. Christophers...

11:04.397 --> 11:07.859
and when he got back from trying to
find the lost treasure of Del Rio...

11:07.984 --> 11:09.319
we were going to be married.

11:09.444 --> 11:10.695
When did all this happen?

11:10.820 --> 11:11.988
Last month.

11:12.363 --> 11:15.450
When you guys were in South
Carolina helping that old sheriff.

11:15.533 --> 11:17.619
I don't want to be
judgmental but...

11:18.077 --> 11:21.915
well, marrying the rich owner of
the newspaper where you work...

11:22.999 --> 11:26.002
Rock Hudson and Doris Day
did that movie in 1950.

11:26.169 --> 11:28.880
I'm not marrying him
for his money.

11:30.215 --> 11:32.592
Let's get back
to this lost city stuff.

11:32.717 --> 11:36.846
There wouldn't happen to be some lost
treasure in this lost city, would there?

11:37.013 --> 11:39.474
Brian isn't after the treasure.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.893
He has a doctorate
in Archeology...

11:42.018 --> 11:44.521
and there happen to be
tremendous cultural finds...

11:44.604 --> 11:47.732
that date back to the
early Peruvian tribes.

11:51.736 --> 11:53.822
Oh, well, now,
this is encouraging.

11:53.905 --> 11:54.864
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:54.989 --> 11:58.868
"El Cajon. Spanish
translation: The coffin."

11:59.285 --> 12:01.871
What kind of a scungele
would call himself a coffin?

12:02.080 --> 12:05.458
Well, probably the same kind that
would call himself Hannibal.

12:07.252 --> 12:11.005
Come on, Face, Hannibal the Great
was a general, he was a thinker.

12:12.257 --> 12:15.927
A coffin is just a suitcase for
a dead body. It lacks style.

12:16.511 --> 12:18.930
It's klutzy, brutish.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.687
The guy is a terrorist slob.

12:26.563 --> 12:30.483
And I think I'd like to tell that to Mr.
Coffin in person.

12:33.069 --> 12:35.822
Face, you spring
Murdock, I'll get B.A.

12:42.245 --> 12:46.207
<i>Yes, yes, it was tragic.</i>

12:46.583 --> 12:49.419
That's why the family
has asked me...

12:49.502 --> 12:52.964
to handle the final part
of the interment.

12:53.089 --> 12:54.507
I don't quite understand.

12:54.591 --> 12:58.386
Are you with the Congregational
Church or Lyman Brothers Mortuary?

12:58.511 --> 12:59.637
Both.

12:59.929 --> 13:03.099
You see, it's all
pre-packaging these days.

13:03.224 --> 13:05.894
One-stop shopping, if you will.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.647
Yes. Now, I've given you
the paper work.

13:09.772 --> 13:13.109
I wonder if I might
have a few...

13:13.276 --> 13:15.904
final moments with the deceased?

13:16.905 --> 13:19.949
Now, that's
Lieutenant Colonel...

13:20.241 --> 13:21.993
Lawrence Bushman.

13:22.118 --> 13:24.537
Colonel Bushman was taken away
this morning, I thought.

13:24.704 --> 13:29.375
If he was, would I be here with
our Heaven Rider number six?

13:29.542 --> 13:31.628
Your what?
The coffin.

13:32.670 --> 13:33.755
Oh.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.508
Would you mind having a few of the
attendants outside unload the hearse?

13:38.301 --> 13:42.263
And which way might
the hospital wing be?

13:42.388 --> 13:45.516
To your left,
second floor, right.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.518
Thank you, child.

14:15.171 --> 14:18.675
Yes, yes, lovely.
Thank you.

14:18.800 --> 14:24.097
And, if one of you might remain
behind to help me with last rites?

14:24.389 --> 14:26.224
Yes. Let me see.

14:26.516 --> 14:29.060
Let me see. I think...

14:30.436 --> 14:34.482
Oh, you, in the whatever.

14:34.565 --> 14:36.192
Yes, he'll do nicely.

14:36.317 --> 14:40.613
And if the rest of you could just
wait outside, please. Thank you.

14:47.036 --> 14:49.414
All right, Murdock, hop in.
We're running a little late.

14:49.539 --> 14:52.792
It's always the same.
It's always the same.

14:52.917 --> 14:56.119
They never ever
give me what I ask for.

14:56.144 --> 14:57.880
Murdock, it's all
I could get, all right?

14:58.006 --> 15:01.050
Are you kidding me?

15:01.509 --> 15:03.720
Who would send me
these little pillows...

15:03.845 --> 15:07.432
and this pale beige lining?

15:07.557 --> 15:10.601
What has this got to do
with the rest of the set?

15:10.727 --> 15:14.605
Has any thought been given as
to who might play the lead...

15:14.731 --> 15:17.984
and would he indeed look good in oak?
Murdock--

15:18.067 --> 15:21.738
I want you to get on to
wardrobe and on to make-up...

15:21.863 --> 15:23.906
and clean this mess up.

15:23.990 --> 15:27.827
This entire production has
been shtank from day one.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.872
- What're you, making a movie?
- The movie.

15:30.997 --> 15:36.294
It's going to be fantastic. It's
called <i>Closed For Remodeling</i>.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.505
You could be a star.

15:39.589 --> 15:42.008
Those eyes,
those blue eyes are stunning!

15:42.133 --> 15:44.177
Why don't you
try the angle from inside.

15:44.260 --> 15:47.055
That's a great idea. You and I
are gonna work well together.

15:47.263 --> 15:50.516
Those eyes, that hair, that chin,
the way it frames the face.

15:50.641 --> 15:51.392
I know.

15:51.476 --> 15:53.519
Half the world's
population should see it.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.438
Where's Murdock?

15:55.563 --> 15:58.649
The service was brief
but very moving.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.903
He broke down and asked if he could
remain behind in the bathroom...

16:02.028 --> 16:03.488
to compose himself.

16:08.659 --> 16:09.994
That was me.

16:10.203 --> 16:14.707
I'm sorry, I sometimes
get carried away.

16:28.971 --> 16:30.640
We need all this stuff,
Hannibal?

16:30.807 --> 16:34.519
For a guy named "The Coffin", I want to
be able to stitch his bag with lead.

16:34.685 --> 16:36.562
How come we gonna
unload it from the van?

16:37.105 --> 16:39.190
Because I have to ship it
to where we're going.

16:41.984 --> 16:43.361
We're flying, ain't we?

16:45.029 --> 16:46.322
That's right, B.A.

16:46.447 --> 16:49.534
It's out of the country and
we're gonna have to fly there.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.203
Only I don't fly, Hannibal.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.955
And now that I know
you want me to fly...

16:54.122 --> 16:55.623
I ain't gonna
turn my back on you.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.834
You ain't gonna get me
with no knock-out drops, man.

16:57.959 --> 17:00.628
Ain't no way you're gonna get
me to eat or drink anything.

17:01.295 --> 17:02.713
I understand.

17:11.556 --> 17:13.849
Then, you won't want...

17:13.974 --> 17:17.103
this last swallow
of your milk, I guess?

17:25.486 --> 17:29.240
<i>The movie business
is in real trouble, Faceman.</i>

17:29.365 --> 17:32.785
<i>Gross receipts are down.</i>

17:32.910 --> 17:36.497
<i>I mean, the whole industry, it's, you
know, it's run by attorneys anyway.</i>

17:36.581 --> 17:40.209
<i>They cut a real filmmaker
to shreds.</i>

17:40.334 --> 17:42.795
<i>Have I got stories. Boy!</i>

17:42.920 --> 17:45.047
<i>Have I got stories to tell you.</i>

17:45.173 --> 17:50.136
<i>I mean, committees of men sitting
around in smoke-filled offices...</i>

17:50.261 --> 17:53.306
- What is this all about?
- Oh, this is gonna be fun.

17:53.389 --> 17:54.891
He's making a movie.

17:54.974 --> 17:58.186
A classic little film called
<i>Closed For Remodeling</i>.

17:58.269 --> 18:01.105
<i>...works of immense
struggle, and I will not...</i>

18:01.439 --> 18:05.067
That's already opened. I saw it
on a theater marquee last week.

18:05.193 --> 18:06.694
Don't you do that to me,
Hannibal.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.238
One lunatic
in this outfit is enough.

18:14.535 --> 18:17.872
Oh, my gosh!
Look at that face!

18:18.080 --> 18:20.416
Have you ever considered
a career in show business?

18:20.541 --> 18:22.335
We have to pick up Tawnia.

18:22.460 --> 18:26.214
We have a lot to do.
Get out of there, Murdock.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.925
You're making a big mistake.
I'm telling you, both of you.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.969
You, meet me
in my office Monday, 5:00.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.388
Hey, <i>Señor</i> Doylee.

19:16.681 --> 19:18.307
I'm looking for Kruger.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.269
He came over here two days ago
with your money.

19:21.602 --> 19:25.314
He never came back. I was about
to send a man to you, <i>señor</i>.

19:25.773 --> 19:29.735
He no show. I think maybe
you no like my work.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.364
I stop many boats,
catch many men for you.

19:33.823 --> 19:35.992
Well, maybe he took off
with the money.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.035
If he gets to Iquitos...

19:38.494 --> 19:41.080
gets drunk and starts telling
anybody what's going on here...

19:41.205 --> 19:43.708
- I am sure this will not happen.
- You killed him?

19:45.501 --> 19:48.045
I am a simple
river boat captain.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.340
The jungle, she is very mean...

19:51.590 --> 19:54.677
and it is a long
dangerous way to Iquitos.

19:55.219 --> 19:59.056
- How many have you got?
- Twenty men, six women.

19:59.849 --> 20:03.019
I will have them
gathered up for you, <i>señor</i>.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.354
Put them on your boat.

20:06.314 --> 20:08.399
I didn't know you could
read, muchacho?

20:08.733 --> 20:13.404
Like this river, <i>señor</i>,
I am a man with many turns.

20:13.779 --> 20:18.617
It is of beautiful women
who sing, dance...

20:18.743 --> 20:21.912
drink wine and love, no?

20:22.496 --> 20:25.708
Where did you get this? This
belongs to Brian Lefcourt.

20:27.668 --> 20:29.045
Is he known to you?

20:29.128 --> 20:31.297
He owns some of the biggest
newspapers in the world.

20:31.422 --> 20:32.840
Ah!

20:33.007 --> 20:37.553
An important man? He must
be worth <i>mucho dinero.</i>

20:38.095 --> 20:40.139
Where is he? I want him now.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.770
My bad leg, she is aching.

20:46.145 --> 20:51.525
It is time for poor crippled
El Cajon to sit, I think.

20:56.238 --> 21:00.618
Where is he, Cajon? Or I'll
blow your stinking heart out.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.912
And if you ever point
this gun at me again...

21:03.037 --> 21:04.789
I'll feed you your leg.

21:07.083 --> 21:11.379
I like you, <i>señor</i>.
You are a man to admire.

21:23.474 --> 21:25.684
Get them up.
Load them aboard.

21:27.645 --> 21:29.438
Come on, move it.

21:38.030 --> 21:41.283
Hold it. Put him
in the forward cabin.

21:46.205 --> 21:49.041
Until next time.
You are a joy, <i>patrón</i>.

21:53.629 --> 21:57.550
But you did a big mistake
with me, <i>muchacho</i>.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.813
I don't know! I do not know!

22:10.938 --> 22:13.315
How am I supposed
to make this classic...

22:13.440 --> 22:17.987
if my driver keeps hitting
every bump in the road?

22:20.781 --> 22:25.411
Help! Help!

22:33.127 --> 22:34.795
Don't tell me
I'm in this coffin, Hannibal!

22:34.962 --> 22:36.255
If you tell me
I'm in this coffin...

22:36.422 --> 22:37.882
I'm going to start
spilling you guys' teeth!

22:38.007 --> 22:41.594
No, no, no, no, no. That's not a coffin,
B.A., that's a Heaven Rider.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.554
Yeah, we at Lyman Brothers
like to think...

22:43.679 --> 22:46.724
that there are no angry
spirits in a Heaven Rider.

22:46.891 --> 22:50.477
You guys slipped me down in a coffin.
That's it. This is the last one.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.688
It's gone too far, Hannibal.
You hear me?

22:52.813 --> 22:55.941
Sergeant Baracus, who was our
Ordnance Officer in Vietnam?

22:56.066 --> 22:58.027
- I was. You know I was.
- Right.

22:58.235 --> 23:01.697
Now, don't think of it as being
shipped down here in a coffin...

23:02.072 --> 23:05.159
think of it as accompanying
our ordnance locker.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.286
And...

23:08.704 --> 23:10.247
a job well done, Sergeant.

23:10.372 --> 23:13.375
This is a coffin, Hannibal,
it's not an ordnance locker.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.587
Now, B.A., emote, emote,
emote!

23:16.879 --> 23:18.547
You guys brought me
down in a coffin.

23:18.631 --> 23:22.551
It will not be in the
final cut, I promise!

23:40.819 --> 23:42.112
Yes?

23:43.239 --> 23:46.158
The Reverend O'Herlihy
and I are transporting a coffin...

23:46.242 --> 23:49.203
up past the bend in the river
to the settlement at Fonte Boa.

23:49.620 --> 23:52.206
We're looking for a river
guide named Little John.

23:52.581 --> 23:54.208
Do you know
where I can find him?

24:19.942 --> 24:23.404
They don't want us to leave.
How hospitable.

24:25.155 --> 24:27.533
Ladies and gentlemen...

24:28.242 --> 24:32.454
my name is H. M. Murdock...

24:32.579 --> 24:35.374
better known in the theatrical
capitals of the world...

24:35.499 --> 24:37.751
as H. M. M.,

24:37.918 --> 24:39.837
or Mmm-hmm.

24:39.962 --> 24:44.258
And I am the greatest director
of the cinema...

24:44.383 --> 24:47.094
that has ever exposed
a frame of film...

24:47.177 --> 24:50.931
and I usually get what I want.

24:51.515 --> 24:55.352
So where are the 200
llama wool sweaters...

24:55.477 --> 24:57.896
that I need for the barbeque
scene on the beach?

24:58.897 --> 25:03.152
You want to be in this picture,
chickie, you better get what I want!

25:04.028 --> 25:05.612
Well, are you gonna
go get the sweaters...

25:05.696 --> 25:08.741
or are you gonna pull one of these
mealy-mouthed <i>el foldos</i> on me?

25:09.241 --> 25:12.369
This is a joke?
You're kidding, <i>señor</i>.

25:12.453 --> 25:14.747
A joke. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

25:14.872 --> 25:16.202
You're gonna joke all the way...

25:16.227 --> 25:18.751
on the plane
back to L.A., boy-o!

25:24.214 --> 25:27.176
I'm looking for a river
guide named Little John.

25:27.551 --> 25:29.053
He died.

25:29.678 --> 25:31.764
No kidding.
When did that happen?

25:31.889 --> 25:33.265
Tomorrow.

25:33.724 --> 25:36.185
And you're gonna
beat him into the ground...

25:36.352 --> 25:40.147
unless you pack your bags
and get out of here real fast.

25:41.023 --> 25:42.983
You're very sure
of yourself, aren't you?

25:43.067 --> 25:45.903
Well, it's a nice,
friendly place you have here.

25:49.406 --> 25:53.619
Now, why don't you
open the door...

25:53.744 --> 25:55.913
and not cause any trouble?

25:56.038 --> 25:59.041
That door stays locked
till you and your friends...

25:59.166 --> 26:01.210
tell us why you're really here.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.505
B.A.

26:20.437 --> 26:24.858
Now, you're the guy with the big mouth
so you can tell me where Little John is.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.485
I tell you nothing.

26:26.568 --> 26:28.529
You want to bet?

26:47.214 --> 26:49.216
Where is Little John?

26:52.428 --> 26:55.848
He's on Bobbi Cardina's
boat at the wharf.

27:04.314 --> 27:07.568
Oh, thank you so much
for your hospitality.

27:16.910 --> 27:18.954
B.A., guard the road.

27:20.664 --> 27:23.417
We're looking for
a man named Little John.

27:25.752 --> 27:28.672
Little John leave many days ago.

27:30.090 --> 27:33.969
Well, what about Bobby Cardina?
Where is he?

27:34.094 --> 27:38.515
Is best you go, <i>señor</i>. The
captain takes no passengers.

27:38.682 --> 27:39.892
No freight.

27:39.975 --> 27:43.020
What is this, caramel custard?

27:43.312 --> 27:47.608
It is material for the church which is
being built beyond the bend in the river.

27:47.691 --> 27:51.528
Yes, well, speaking of churches,
I'm the Reverend Galen Giles...

27:51.570 --> 27:54.907
and we're taking this casket to
the settlement at Fonte Boa.

27:55.032 --> 27:57.784
<i>Señores</i>, you must go.

28:20.557 --> 28:22.267
We got trouble coming, Hannibal!

28:22.351 --> 28:24.353
- Cut us loose, Face.
- Hannibal, we got trouble coming!

28:24.436 --> 28:26.563
All right, we're
gonna borrow your barge!

28:26.688 --> 28:28.774
Everybody off this sucker!

29:23.453 --> 29:25.080
He didn't make it.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.710
Nice drinking with you!

29:31.753 --> 29:34.089
Okay, <i>querido</i>,
who the hell are you?

29:36.425 --> 29:38.385
My name is Hannibal Smith.

29:39.970 --> 29:43.265
And if I could persuade you
to take that gun down...

29:43.557 --> 29:46.810
this could be the start of an
interesting friendship. Who are you?

29:51.815 --> 29:54.693
My name is Bobbi Cardina and I'm
the captain of this vessel.

29:54.818 --> 29:58.322
Miss Cardina, I hope
we haven't inconvenienced you.

29:58.447 --> 30:00.282
Look what you have done, <i>señor</i>.

30:00.657 --> 30:04.161
I've only half the load.
You have cost me much money.

30:04.286 --> 30:06.955
If I could persuade
you to put that gun down...

30:07.164 --> 30:08.749
perhaps I can make it up to you.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.001
Well, perhaps you could
persuade your friends...

30:11.084 --> 30:13.170
to put down their guns as well.

30:20.886 --> 30:23.680
Now, <i>señor</i>,
get ready for a swim.

30:23.847 --> 30:25.349
But you haven't heard my offer.

30:25.557 --> 30:30.145
I will pay you $100,000
in American money...

30:30.270 --> 30:31.897
to take us to the settlement.

30:32.147 --> 30:35.192
Now, I know you got a deal with
El Cajon, the river pirate.

30:35.692 --> 30:38.028
Some reason he lets you get by.

30:38.236 --> 30:39.905
Think about it, Miss Cardina...

30:40.322 --> 30:43.533
$100,000, American.

30:43.777 --> 30:46.328
- You have the money on you?
- It's in the coffin.

30:49.081 --> 30:53.627
What a wonderful idea, Colonel.
It's gonna look great in my film.

30:56.546 --> 30:58.799
There is no money, is there?

30:58.924 --> 31:02.344
Well, not yet, but who knows.

31:02.511 --> 31:04.638
Let's say that we're
at a standoff.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.062
There are no standoffs, <i>querido</i>.

31:12.854 --> 31:15.232
I like this girl, Hannibal.

31:20.862 --> 31:22.114
So do I.

31:24.533 --> 31:26.618
You are crazy men, no?

31:26.743 --> 31:29.871
I'm not crazy.
I'm a great filmmaker.

31:29.955 --> 31:33.041
I have visions that I turn
into cellular monuments...

31:33.125 --> 31:36.253
and I'm here to tell you
that with your aspect ratio...

31:36.378 --> 31:39.840
you could walk with
the cinematic gods.

31:41.800 --> 31:46.263
Actually, what we're looking
for, see, is a river guide.

31:46.555 --> 31:48.390
Yeah, a chap by the name
of Little John.

31:48.473 --> 31:51.309
He was the guide
for Brian Lefcourt's party.

31:51.393 --> 31:52.769
Yes, I heard that.

31:52.894 --> 31:54.104
<i>Señor</i> Lefcourt
has been captured.

31:54.187 --> 31:57.816
Many people are captured on this river.
None are ever seen again.

31:57.941 --> 31:59.651
You're saying he's been killed?

31:59.776 --> 32:01.945
I'm saying none
are ever seen again.

32:02.404 --> 32:04.114
El Cajon is a pirate.

32:05.031 --> 32:07.033
He lives by a pirate's code.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.661
Well, Mr. Coffin's in
for a big surprise...

32:09.870 --> 32:11.997
because we've got
a code of our own.

32:16.334 --> 32:20.255
<i>Señor</i>, I have heard from one of
Doyle's men in Monte Alegre...

32:20.380 --> 32:21.882
the big one named Churlisco,

32:22.007 --> 32:24.551
he was attacked
in a bar by four men.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.012
And they have taken
the Cardina river barge.

32:27.137 --> 32:29.347
It is about one mile
up river from here.

32:29.556 --> 32:31.516
Which men? Whose men?

32:31.641 --> 32:34.269
I don't know.
But they're armed.

32:34.978 --> 32:37.856
We will show these men
what happens...

32:37.981 --> 32:41.151
when one passes
bend in the river...

32:41.276 --> 32:44.154
without the permission
of El Cajon.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.160
We're coming
to the bend in the river.

32:50.285 --> 32:52.162
Keep it in the center
of the current.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.458
- Now--
- I don't know...

32:56.541 --> 32:58.418
props must be asleep
on this picture.

32:58.502 --> 33:02.130
I asked to have some small
canoes along that bank.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.424
You know,
symbolizing lost battles...

33:04.674 --> 33:06.978
That's not props, Murdock,
that's set dressing.

33:07.048 --> 33:09.012
Oh, it's not props. What?

33:09.280 --> 33:11.783
Take positions over here and
keep your rifles out of sight.

33:16.102 --> 33:20.232
All right, if that slime
ball jumps us, we'll sink him.

33:20.357 --> 33:22.984
Get inside, honey. Not
on your life, Hannibal.

33:23.109 --> 33:25.403
I got you guys into this.
I'm not going below decks.

33:25.487 --> 33:26.488
Right.

33:26.571 --> 33:28.323
Hannibal.

33:30.659 --> 33:32.702
You like this, don't you, <i>señor</i> ?

33:32.911 --> 33:34.579
It does get the blood started.

33:34.704 --> 33:37.582
Now, when the firing starts,
stay down.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.627
I will pilot this vessel.

33:41.837 --> 33:43.505
It's all I own.

33:50.011 --> 33:53.723
All right, stand by.
Here he comes.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.494
<i>Señor</i>, we have
some engine trouble.

34:14.703 --> 34:16.413
Would you help us, please?

34:16.538 --> 34:20.333
Get that bunch of lumber out of
my way or I'll run you down.

34:20.417 --> 34:23.837
This may be harder
than you think, <i>señor</i>.

34:24.212 --> 34:26.922
If you have guns
you will drop them.

34:27.007 --> 34:29.259
Forget it, pal,
we're going through.

34:29.384 --> 34:33.929
No way, <i>señor</i>. You are
four, we are ten.

34:49.446 --> 34:51.697
Pull back! Pull back!

35:11.593 --> 35:13.637
Hold it right there!

35:26.608 --> 35:28.068
You are well armed, <i>señor</i>.

35:28.193 --> 35:31.196
Are you the jackass that
calls himself "The Coffin"?

35:31.279 --> 35:32.948
Yes, <i>señor</i>. El Cajon.

35:33.198 --> 35:36.242
Mr. Coffin,
please do not sweat.

35:36.368 --> 35:39.162
There is to be
no sweating in my film.

35:39.287 --> 35:42.582
Here, wipe it off yourself.

35:43.333 --> 35:47.796
All right, now take us
to your camp. Move it.

35:48.922 --> 35:51.299
Boy, do I love this movie.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.093
Don't you?

36:16.616 --> 36:17.909
B.A.

36:20.578 --> 36:22.414
See if you can find some
place to lock these guys up.

36:22.539 --> 36:23.623
Right.

36:24.374 --> 36:27.085
<i>Ándele,
ándele! Pronto!</i>

36:31.006 --> 36:32.674
Not you, Coffin.

36:34.384 --> 36:36.594
The pirate business
hasn't been so good, huh?

36:37.095 --> 36:39.889
<i>Señor</i>, if you knew
the problems...

36:40.015 --> 36:42.809
a poor river boat
pirate must face.

36:42.976 --> 36:44.644
It is not an easy life.

36:44.811 --> 36:47.230
Yeah, and it isn't getting
any easier, is it?

36:47.897 --> 36:50.525
Okay, which one
of these <i>cabañas</i> is yours?

36:51.943 --> 36:53.903
The one with
the TV antenna, huh?

36:54.112 --> 36:55.989
The reception is <i>muy malo</i>.

36:56.239 --> 36:59.534
Get only Donald Duck
on Saturday without sound.

36:59.868 --> 37:02.328
What a shame.
Let's take a look.

37:04.998 --> 37:07.125
We're looking
for Brian Lefcourt.

37:09.252 --> 37:11.713
We know you attacked his boat.
Now, where is he?

37:11.963 --> 37:14.841
<i>Señor</i>, my leg is wood...

37:15.258 --> 37:17.260
and she aches very much.

37:17.594 --> 37:19.971
Perhaps El Cajon
might sit down...

37:20.138 --> 37:23.850
while we speak about
this <i>Señor</i> Lefcourt.

37:24.601 --> 37:27.979
Okay, but keep
your hands in sight.

37:39.240 --> 37:43.203
This <i>Señor</i> Lefcourt,
you have come...

37:43.453 --> 37:48.458
all this way with these
powerful weapons to find him?

37:48.541 --> 37:50.001
I'll ask the questions.

37:50.126 --> 37:53.713
Now open up, before I take you
outside and hang you upside down.

37:53.797 --> 37:57.050
Is this the way to speak
to the respected enemy?

37:57.133 --> 37:58.843
That's the way I am.

37:59.135 --> 38:00.762
Spill it, Coffin.

38:01.012 --> 38:04.933
In that case, <i>adiós</i>, <i>señor</i>.

38:09.437 --> 38:13.358
- So, you had a little surprise for me, huh?
- No, I don't.

38:20.448 --> 38:22.909
You ought to get some
plastic cartridges, pal.

38:22.992 --> 38:25.286
You can't go swimming
with those paper-wrapped.

38:25.411 --> 38:28.915
You catch me at disadvantage, <i>señor</i>.
Give me the chance.

38:28.998 --> 38:31.292
Same chance you gave me, huh?

38:31.709 --> 38:35.088
Yeah, but you had
nothing of value to trade.

38:35.797 --> 38:38.007
But I have something for you.

38:38.508 --> 38:42.178
The traveler you seek,
<i>Señor</i> Lefcourt.

38:42.387 --> 38:45.890
I can give him to you.
I can, <i>señor</i>.

38:51.646 --> 38:52.647
Doyle here.

38:52.730 --> 38:55.525
<i>Señor</i> Doylee, <i>hola</i>.

38:56.025 --> 38:59.529
I have for you some news.
Not so good.

39:00.113 --> 39:03.992
I have some peoples here,
and they look for the man...

39:04.200 --> 39:06.286
the one called Lefcourt.

39:06.369 --> 39:07.412
<i>Who are they?</i>

39:07.528 --> 39:08.696
<i>They say what they're after?</i>

39:08.746 --> 39:12.584
No, they just seek
for the one called Lefcourt.

39:12.834 --> 39:14.210
And you've captured them?

39:16.588 --> 39:18.173
They are here with me.

39:18.298 --> 39:20.675
Well, hang on to them.
I'll be there at first light.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.178
They shall be here
when you arrive.

39:23.553 --> 39:25.180
You have my word.

39:40.570 --> 39:42.780
Hey, <i>Señor</i> Doylee.

39:43.656 --> 39:46.618
What's going on? How come
your boat's half sunk?

39:46.743 --> 39:50.663
I always knew that you had
the good nose for trouble...

39:50.955 --> 39:53.291
and we have plenty.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.672
Beautiful, B.A.,
it was beautiful.

39:59.756 --> 40:01.883
You're gonna be
a sensation at Cannes.

40:02.008 --> 40:06.179
Okay, boy-chick,
this next shot...

40:06.262 --> 40:10.225
is gonna be multiple cameras.
It's the great massacre scene.

40:10.391 --> 40:13.937
It's where your body is riddled
with thousands of bullets.

40:14.020 --> 40:18.066
Unfortunately, I got to get it
the first time. No retakes.

40:18.191 --> 40:19.359
You get my drift?

40:19.484 --> 40:22.028
You wanted to talk to us
about Brian Lefcourt.

40:22.445 --> 40:24.530
You stupid, fat pig.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.242
I would not be
too harsh with the words...

40:27.367 --> 40:31.204
considering where
we both stand, my friend.

40:31.329 --> 40:35.875
We want to know about Brian.
Is he all right?

40:36.918 --> 40:39.254
The lady asked you
a question, pal.

40:40.380 --> 40:42.966
Is he? Tell me.

40:43.341 --> 40:45.969
I'm sure you will see him
soon enough, <i>chiquita</i>.

40:46.594 --> 40:48.554
Their weapons
are no good, Doyle.

40:55.061 --> 40:58.022
Shall we drop the weapons,
gentlemen?

40:58.147 --> 41:01.651
Might as well. She pulled
the firing pins, guys.

41:01.734 --> 41:03.403
I am sorry, <i>querido</i>.

41:03.486 --> 41:05.405
Not half as sorry as I am.

41:05.530 --> 41:08.408
Not as sorry as you will be.

41:08.825 --> 41:10.535
Get them aboard the barge!

41:23.715 --> 41:25.800
You will return them
to the encampment...

41:25.925 --> 41:27.593
and then continue on
with your supplies.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.554
I will have to make
one more trip.

41:29.887 --> 41:31.764
There was to be no more trips.

41:31.848 --> 41:34.934
Because of them I had to shove
off without being fully loaded.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.270
What is one more trip
among friends?

41:37.395 --> 41:41.065
Under the circumstances, I do not think
you have much to complain about.

41:52.577 --> 41:53.953
Are you <i>loco</i> ?

41:54.662 --> 41:57.165
If not for her,
we would be their prisoners.

41:57.290 --> 42:00.710
If not for her, they wouldn't
be here in the first place.

42:00.835 --> 42:04.116
Every trip she takes past the
bend in the river jeopardizes us.

42:05.006 --> 42:07.050
Now we are on the alert.

42:07.133 --> 42:08.718
We will watch them.

42:08.885 --> 42:12.263
But that was foolish,
<i>Señor</i> Doylee.

42:12.513 --> 42:14.307
She's a stubborn one.

42:15.141 --> 42:16.476
Never mind.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.604
After this delivery I'll
have no use for her anyway.

42:20.146 --> 42:21.981
You wish me to kill her?

42:22.065 --> 42:23.191
No.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.361
She is one I want for myself.

42:42.168 --> 42:44.295
<i>Yeah, Hannibal, I hope
you're working on another plan.</i>

42:44.420 --> 42:46.964
- We haven't finished with the old plan.
- What old one?

42:47.090 --> 42:49.634
The one that takes us
to find Brian Lefcourt.

42:49.717 --> 42:52.261
You call getting caught
like this a plan?

42:52.428 --> 42:53.971
Well, with
a few minor glitches...

42:54.097 --> 42:55.765
it takes us
directly to Lefcourt.

42:55.848 --> 42:58.267
- Sounds logical to me.
- It would.

42:59.060 --> 43:00.353
Cast off.
