01:23.170 --> 01:24.570
Hello? Who!?

01:24.940 --> 01:26.700
No. I'm sorry, I don't know anyone by that name

01:26.910 --> 01:28.970
No, listen, I get about a hundred customers a night

01:29.280 --> 01:30.540
I can't keep track of them all.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.510
Do you know... well tell me what he likes to eat

01:32.850 --> 01:33.840
Cause I remember people by what they order

01:34.180 --> 01:35.980
Not by their names

01:36.690 --> 01:37.880
"Meat Loaf? "

01:38.090 --> 01:40.820
Well, I know a Meat Loaf with Mashed Potatoes.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.390
I know Meat Loaf who likes

01:42.590 --> 01:46.250
Well, with Cheese Fries, Pouched Egg, Onion Rings

01:46.700 --> 01:48.720
What? He doesn't like potatoes?

01:48.930 --> 01:52.300
Why don't you, well, yeah give me your number

01:52.530 --> 01:54.160
And if I see him, I'll tell him to call you

01:54.670 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, I promise. I will. Ok bye

02:00.540 --> 02:02.410
He's 5'11 with dark brown hair

02:02.640 --> 02:05.200
Sorry, I can't think of any Meat Loafs with Cheese Fries

02:05.410 --> 02:07.110
or Onion Rings or Pouched Eggs

02:07.380 --> 02:09.610
Or Fried Fillet of Fish that match that description

02:10.050 --> 02:12.080
Last time we were here, I think he had the pork chops

02:12.490 --> 02:13.480
Oh why didn't you say so?

02:13.820 --> 02:16.290
That's because we supposedly have the best pork chops in the city

02:16.520 --> 02:17.080
You ever tried them?

02:17.330 --> 02:18.090
No, I haven't

02:18.290 --> 02:20.120
Why not? What, are you religious or something?

02:21.130 --> 02:22.990
Listen, have you seen him or not?

02:24.400 --> 02:28.060
5'11 ". Dark brown hair. Pork chops

02:28.800 --> 02:31.200
I have actually. He came in here for dinner last night

02:31.570 --> 02:32.370
He ordered two pork chops

02:32.640 --> 02:35.130
One with mashed potatoes and one with string beans.

02:36.180 --> 02:37.340
I guess he was hungry

02:37.610 --> 02:38.980
No, he didn't eat both of them.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.150
Our portions are too big for a person to eat two

02:41.450 --> 02:43.540
No, one was for him and one was for his girlfriend

02:44.520 --> 02:46.180
Look! Just get to the point...

02:46.520 --> 02:48.180
Don't... Don't change the subject!

02:49.860 --> 02:51.720
Are you seeing someone else?

02:53.030 --> 02:54.020
Who is she?

02:57.230 --> 02:58.700
I hope you both drop dead!

03:19.220 --> 03:21.020
If someone comes in here looking for me

03:21.220 --> 03:22.380
give him these keys

03:23.090 --> 03:23.850
What do I tell him?

03:24.090 --> 03:25.350
Tell him he's an asshole!

03:30.630 --> 03:31.720
Taxi!

03:55.490 --> 03:57.050
Hey, did he pick up the keys?

03:57.790 --> 03:59.050
No, not yet

04:10.170 --> 04:11.570
Do you have an extra cigarette?

04:11.740 --> 04:12.710
Sure

04:14.980 --> 04:16.170
Rolled it myself

04:16.410 --> 04:17.279
Thanks

04:27.390 --> 04:28.410
You okay?

04:29.090 --> 04:29.950
Yeah

04:31.560 --> 04:33.320
I haven't had one in a while

04:33.560 --> 04:35.220
I only smoke when I get stressed out

04:35.430 --> 04:36.290
Well, you shouldn't worry so much

04:36.700 --> 04:38.130
That way you'll avoid lung cancer

04:41.700 --> 04:42.970
Do you think she's pretty?

04:44.070 --> 04:44.730
Who?

04:44.940 --> 04:46.200
The girl he was in here with

04:47.710 --> 04:50.470
Oh, she was okay I guess... I mean

04:50.710 --> 04:53.040
Not the type I would prefer to have my pork chops with

04:53.350 --> 04:56.220
but "each man to his own", right?

04:57.120 --> 04:58.480
Yeah right

05:36.220 --> 05:37.090
Hello

05:37.330 --> 05:38.350
Hey

05:45.930 --> 05:47.530
I need someone to talk to

05:52.440 --> 05:54.030
Do you think he'll pick up the keys?

05:54.480 --> 05:55.640
I don't know

05:55.980 --> 05:58.280
I've had customers leaving keys here for years

05:58.510 --> 06:00.040
Sometimes they pick them up in a few days

06:00.320 --> 06:02.410
Sometimes it takes a few weeks

06:02.950 --> 06:04.380
Well, what about most of the time?

06:04.620 --> 06:07.250
Most of the time, the keys stay in the jar

06:13.730 --> 06:15.160
Well why do you keep them?

06:15.630 --> 06:16.650
You should just throw them out

06:16.860 --> 06:17.850
No

06:19.170 --> 06:20.690
No I couldn't do that

06:22.300 --> 06:23.360
Why not?

06:24.210 --> 06:25.930
If I threw these keys away

06:26.170 --> 06:28.940
then those doors will be closed forever

06:29.210 --> 06:30.730
And that shouldn't be up to me to decide

06:32.150 --> 06:33.240
Should it?

06:38.890 --> 06:40.790
Guess I'm just looking for a reason

06:43.090 --> 06:45.490
Well, from my observations

06:46.830 --> 06:49.560
sometimes it's better off not knowing

06:49.900 --> 06:54.030
and other times there's no reason to be found

06:54.240 --> 06:55.930
Everything has a reason

06:59.810 --> 07:01.370
It's like these pies and cakes

07:02.140 --> 07:03.610
At the end of every night

07:04.150 --> 07:07.670
the cheesecake and the apple pie are always completely gone

07:07.880 --> 07:09.210
The peach cobbler

07:09.520 --> 07:12.320
and the chocolate mousse cake are nearly finished

07:12.490 --> 07:17.360
But there's always a whole blueberry pie left untouched

07:19.260 --> 07:21.090
So what's wrong with the blueberry pie?

07:21.300 --> 07:22.990
There's nothing's wrong with the blueberry pie

07:23.260 --> 07:24.290
It's just people make other choices

07:24.570 --> 07:25.930
You can't blame the blueberry pie

07:26.200 --> 07:27.930
It's just no one wants it

07:30.070 --> 07:31.060
Wait!

07:32.940 --> 07:34.240
I want a piece

07:34.510 --> 07:35.530
With ice cream?

07:38.780 --> 07:39.750
Leave it to me

07:47.020 --> 07:48.010
Here we go

07:48.890 --> 07:50.080
I hope you enjoy it

07:50.290 --> 07:51.160
Thanks

08:09.040 --> 08:10.030
It's not bad

08:10.240 --> 08:11.180
Really?

08:14.020 --> 08:15.070
You should try some

08:15.280 --> 08:17.910
No, I'm alright. I have my own

09:12.840 --> 09:15.470
Will you tell me the stories behind those other keys?

09:17.750 --> 09:18.710
What for?

09:20.880 --> 09:23.540
I just wondered how they all ended up here

09:27.560 --> 09:28.520
Pick one

09:33.930 --> 09:37.660
Those belonged to a young couple a few years ago.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.030
They were naive enough to believe

09:39.300 --> 09:41.170
that they were gonna spend the rest of their lives together

09:42.640 --> 09:43.760
Well, what happened?

09:44.540 --> 09:45.840
Life happened

09:46.740 --> 09:48.500
Things happened. Yeah, time happened

09:50.140 --> 09:52.510
It's pretty much always the case more or less

09:54.850 --> 09:57.040
Or maybe one of them ran off with someone else

09:57.250 --> 09:59.120
Maybe the feelings just went away

10:05.730 --> 10:06.950
What about these?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.860
Those belonged to a little old lady

10:10.100 --> 10:12.220
Her best friend would pick them up and come to visit her

10:12.470 --> 10:14.090
She dropped them off and I never saw her again

10:14.340 --> 10:15.530
I presumed, I mean, she was pretty old

10:15.740 --> 10:18.260
I presumed she passed away or something

10:21.510 --> 10:22.910
What about these?

10:25.550 --> 10:28.170
These keys used to belong to a young lad

10:28.850 --> 10:30.340
from Manchester England

10:31.650 --> 10:33.620
who made plans and had dreams

10:33.820 --> 10:35.580
of running every marathon in this country

10:35.920 --> 10:37.150
starting in New York

10:38.790 --> 10:41.260
He was going to write a journal about his experiences

10:41.630 --> 10:44.460
and ended up running a cafe.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.000
Later they were given to a Russian girl

10:49.640 --> 10:51.470
who loved collecting keys

10:52.470 --> 10:53.870
and watching sunsets

10:54.980 --> 10:58.410
Unfortunately, she loved sunsets more than the keys

10:58.710 --> 11:00.270
and ended up disappearing into one

11:02.680 --> 11:04.780
Why didn't you go looking for her?

11:11.430 --> 11:12.450
When I was little

11:12.730 --> 11:14.960
me mum used to take me to the park on weekends

11:15.360 --> 11:17.160
She said if I ever got lost

11:17.770 --> 11:21.060
I had to stay in one place so that she'd find me

11:21.400 --> 11:22.300
Does that work?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.200
Not really

11:25.110 --> 11:27.130
She got lost once looking for me

11:27.840 --> 11:29.330
Eh, you want some more ice cream?

11:29.880 --> 11:30.610
No thanks

11:30.810 --> 11:31.610
You sure?

11:31.850 --> 11:33.040
Yeah I'm fine. Thanks

12:14.420 --> 12:15.390
You're late

12:17.990 --> 12:19.220
Same as usual?

12:31.410 --> 12:32.530
No thanks

12:39.150 --> 12:40.580
Can I have my keys back?

12:41.650 --> 12:43.080
Yeah, sure

12:47.390 --> 12:48.380
So...

12:49.660 --> 12:51.990
You two have patched things up then?

12:54.460 --> 12:55.390
Thanks

13:27.900 --> 13:29.260
Lousy bloody camera

13:34.070 --> 13:35.000
Hey!

13:35.240 --> 13:37.800
Alright. Come on. Break it... Alright!

13:38.010 --> 13:39.840
Take it outside. Take it out...

13:40.110 --> 13:40.630
None of your business cupcake!

13:40.940 --> 13:41.700
Don't start with me mate!

13:41.980 --> 13:43.310
Don't you start... Come here!

13:43.580 --> 13:44.480
Right you come here

13:44.880 --> 13:46.040
Get out of my place!

13:48.150 --> 13:49.780
Don't start with me!

13:50.020 --> 13:50.880
Get out!

13:51.620 --> 13:53.710
Hey you haven't paid yet!

14:15.940 --> 14:17.100
Can I have a tissue?

14:17.310 --> 14:18.180
What happened?

14:18.650 --> 14:19.510
Did he hit you?

14:19.710 --> 14:20.680
No!

14:20.980 --> 14:22.070
Well what?

14:23.420 --> 14:25.320
I got mugged on the subway

14:25.850 --> 14:27.820
I thought Pork Chop lived around here?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.480
He does

14:30.860 --> 14:32.690
What were you doing on the subway?

14:33.830 --> 14:34.890
Well...

14:35.800 --> 14:38.060
I just needed some time to prepare myself

14:40.170 --> 14:42.290
I was gonna get off in a few stops

14:43.770 --> 14:44.930
I don't know, I just

14:45.140 --> 14:46.970
The next thing I knew, I ended up in the Bronx

14:47.940 --> 14:50.270
That's a very interesting way to prepare yourself

14:56.520 --> 14:58.580
I've never been very good at confrontation

15:01.320 --> 15:03.020
Some people enjoy it

15:03.920 --> 15:05.020
Not me

15:09.660 --> 15:11.260
Hey, are you alright?

15:11.530 --> 15:12.830
Should we call the police or something?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.140
No

15:19.640 --> 15:21.800
No, he didn't get away with very much

15:23.140 --> 15:25.540
Especially after I kicked him in the balls

15:26.550 --> 15:27.540
You didn't

15:36.190 --> 15:37.920
Wait, what happened to you?

15:41.730 --> 15:43.860
I ate too much chocolate today

15:52.340 --> 15:53.700
What's wrong with your camera?

15:53.910 --> 15:55.000
Oh, I don't know

15:55.240 --> 15:58.300
It's been in a lousy mood these past few days

15:59.810 --> 16:02.720
It doesn't really keep people from stealing, does it?

16:03.020 --> 16:03.950
No

16:06.590 --> 16:07.710
Not really

16:08.460 --> 16:11.050
But I like having it around, 'cause

16:13.390 --> 16:15.060
for me it's like my diary

16:15.660 --> 16:16.490
You know?

16:23.570 --> 16:25.770
Some nights, I watch the tapes back and

16:27.240 --> 16:29.730
I'm amazed at how much I've missed

16:31.180 --> 16:33.740
That's going on right in front of me

16:35.920 --> 16:37.650
You must have a lot of tapes

16:39.850 --> 16:41.450
I don't keep them all

16:41.660 --> 16:42.950
I'm not that weird

16:44.790 --> 16:46.260
Only the highlights

16:58.410 --> 16:59.530
Can I take a look?

17:00.770 --> 17:01.710
Sure

17:03.040 --> 17:04.030
Come around

21:17.100 --> 21:20.230
She left behind her set of keys and disappeared that night

21:58.070 --> 22:01.440
How do you say goodbye to someone you can't imagine living without?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.530
I didn't say goodbye

22:08.720 --> 22:10.210
I didn't say anything

22:14.820 --> 22:16.190
I just walked away

22:18.830 --> 22:20.260
At the end of that night

22:20.490 --> 22:23.290
I decided to take the longest way to cross the street

22:32.540 --> 22:33.840
Dear Jeremy

22:34.810 --> 22:36.670
As you can see by this postcard

22:36.910 --> 22:38.400
I'm now in Memphis, Tennessee

22:38.650 --> 22:41.050
Hey Lizzy, hurry up with those damn pick-ups will ya!

22:41.220 --> 22:41.700
Coming!

22:41.950 --> 22:42.470
Come on hustle it!

22:42.780 --> 22:44.810
It took me a long time to get here

22:45.150 --> 22:47.210
And I'm not sure how long I'll be staying

22:48.320 --> 22:50.920
During the day, I work at a diner downtown

22:52.130 --> 22:53.820
I haven't been able to sleep at night

22:54.060 --> 22:57.030
so I've also taken a waitressing job at a bar

22:58.370 --> 23:02.360
It's kind of a dive, but the tips are pretty good

23:02.870 --> 23:05.000
Working two jobs is exhausting

23:05.440 --> 23:07.170
But at least it keeps me busy

23:07.670 --> 23:11.300
and most importantly, it keeps my mind away from him

23:43.180 --> 23:43.700
Hi girl

23:43.940 --> 23:44.840
Hey Sandy

23:45.610 --> 23:46.510
You going home?

23:47.350 --> 23:48.510
Let me put it this way

23:49.250 --> 23:50.650
I'm getting up out of here

23:52.790 --> 23:54.220
I wish I could go

23:54.590 --> 23:55.750
What's wrong?

23:55.960 --> 23:57.150
That guy at the bar

23:57.690 --> 23:59.320
I don't think he's ever gonna leave

24:00.690 --> 24:02.690
Oh you're talking about Arnie?

24:02.960 --> 24:03.860
Child, don't worry about him.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.930
He probably just lost track of time

24:06.170 --> 24:07.260
But now if you need to get going

24:07.530 --> 24:09.370
You just bring his check to him, have him sign it

24:09.740 --> 24:10.900
Travis runs a tab for him

24:11.370 --> 24:12.700
Well, does he always stay this late?

24:13.310 --> 24:14.600
Always

24:15.080 --> 24:16.800
You stick around here you see for yourself

24:17.540 --> 24:18.370
Have a good night darlin'

24:18.610 --> 24:20.140
You too. Good night

24:31.060 --> 24:32.360
Here's your check

24:50.010 --> 24:51.380
Just eight?

24:53.010 --> 24:55.850
I coulda sworn I had at least nine

24:56.820 --> 24:58.280
No, just eight

25:00.490 --> 25:01.850
Do you have a pen?

25:02.660 --> 25:03.680
Yeah

25:07.730 --> 25:09.360
I don't recognize you

25:10.000 --> 25:12.060
You new around here or something?

25:12.270 --> 25:13.660
I just started a few nights ago

25:14.000 --> 25:15.130
Oh

25:21.840 --> 25:23.310
Have you got a name?

25:24.640 --> 25:25.630
Lizzie

25:25.950 --> 25:27.140
Lizzie

25:29.680 --> 25:33.050
Well, it's been a pleasure getting to know you Lizzie

25:35.790 --> 25:37.020
What do you mean?

25:37.320 --> 25:40.660
You won't be seeing much more of me from now on

25:41.090 --> 25:42.150
Why's that?

25:44.800 --> 25:48.600
Well I don't have much reason to come back here anymore

25:51.440 --> 25:53.530
Tonight was my last night of drinking

25:53.970 --> 25:54.740
Oh

25:57.280 --> 25:58.400
Yeah

26:00.410 --> 26:03.470
So, you just give that to Travis

26:04.850 --> 26:07.720
Tell him I'll cut him a check

26:08.260 --> 26:09.220
Ok

26:15.630 --> 26:16.720
That's for you

26:17.730 --> 26:18.820
Thank you

26:23.640 --> 26:24.570
Bye

26:40.850 --> 26:42.080
Oh, hi

26:43.160 --> 26:44.490
Do you have a twin sister?

26:44.890 --> 26:45.820
No

26:46.830 --> 26:47.820
I wish I did

26:48.060 --> 26:50.620
Yeah? Well, I'm glad I don't have a twin

26:50.860 --> 26:52.200
One of me's plenty

26:55.740 --> 26:59.070
Well, let's see I'm just gonna have the chicken fried steak

26:59.410 --> 27:00.370
and a side of string beans

27:01.170 --> 27:02.160
Ok

27:02.780 --> 27:03.800
Coming right up

27:08.720 --> 27:10.980
Hey! Knock that crap off over there!

27:11.750 --> 27:13.550
This is a restaurant, not a damn dancehall!

27:22.260 --> 27:24.590
How come you're working so hard, Lizzie?

27:25.070 --> 27:26.660
I'm trying to save up for a car

27:28.470 --> 27:29.700
Where are you going?

27:31.140 --> 27:34.440
Well, I don't have any specific destination in mind, but

27:35.180 --> 27:37.580
I'm just gonna go until I run out of places to go

27:38.380 --> 27:39.570
I wish I could do that

27:39.780 --> 27:40.870
Here's your change

27:42.150 --> 27:43.640
You put that towards a Buick

27:44.350 --> 27:45.280
Thank you

27:51.120 --> 27:52.090
Hi

27:53.030 --> 27:54.360
Wait what are you doing here?

27:54.530 --> 27:55.050
What?

27:55.360 --> 27:56.450
What are you doing here?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.290
Oh, I'm celebrating

27:58.870 --> 27:59.920
What are you celebrating?

28:00.170 --> 28:01.830
My last night of drinking!

28:04.000 --> 28:06.170
He's not giving you a hard time, is he?

28:07.140 --> 28:08.800
I think he just wants to talk

28:09.140 --> 28:12.630
That's funny, 'cause he almost never wants to talk

28:13.710 --> 28:15.200
He's not hitting on you, is he?

28:15.450 --> 28:18.140
No. I don't think it's like that

28:19.020 --> 28:19.820
It's too bad

28:20.050 --> 28:22.210
Be nice to see him take an interest in a woman

28:22.520 --> 28:23.280
I thought he was married

28:23.520 --> 28:27.020
Yeah, that's precisely the problem. He still thinks he is

28:35.340 --> 28:36.560
Holy shit

28:49.480 --> 28:50.810
Travis, how's it hanging?

28:51.080 --> 28:52.980
Always a pleasure, Sue Lynne

28:53.550 --> 28:54.710
You always say that to me

28:55.020 --> 28:56.250
and I never know whether you mean it

28:56.890 --> 28:59.290
I'm just dropping in to use the ladies' room

28:59.960 --> 29:01.390
Do I have to buy a beer first?

29:01.600 --> 29:03.860
Your money's no good here, Sue Lynne

29:40.830 --> 29:42.170
Have you got a moment?

29:42.470 --> 29:43.990
I got nothing to say to you

30:09.500 --> 30:10.520
Arnie?

30:14.470 --> 30:15.660
Arnie?

30:18.100 --> 30:19.230
Yeah?

30:26.110 --> 30:28.080
I know its none of my business

30:30.950 --> 30:33.610
but have you ever thought about cutting back.

30:34.890 --> 30:36.750
Have I thought about it?

30:54.870 --> 30:56.100
What are these?

30:59.310 --> 31:02.610
A group I go to sometimes, Lizzie,

31:04.650 --> 31:06.240
has this system.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.350
After a meeting,

31:12.890 --> 31:16.790
they invite the new people to come down and

31:17.760 --> 31:19.390
pick up a white chip.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.600
You take it as a symbol of your intention

31:29.310 --> 31:30.710
to stay sober.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.720
And if you

31:38.550 --> 31:40.990
slip up and drink again

31:44.320 --> 31:47.420
you got to come back and pick up another chip.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.540
This one is for ninety days.

32:01.140 --> 32:02.730
I got that far.

32:03.780 --> 32:05.070
Once.

32:17.990 --> 32:20.720
See all those white chips, Lizzie?

32:24.060 --> 32:27.760
I am the king of the white chip.

33:04.140 --> 33:05.430
Dear Jeremy.

33:06.170 --> 33:09.660
I thought about what Arnie said about the sobriety chips,

33:10.510 --> 33:13.000
how to focus your attention on something else

33:13.250 --> 33:15.080
in order to cure your addiction.

33:17.520 --> 33:22.420
If I was an addict, I'd choose blueberry pie as my chip.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.320
Writing to your boyfriend?

33:30.730 --> 33:32.790
No, just someone I know.

33:33.830 --> 33:35.660
Why not pick up the phone?

33:37.800 --> 33:39.930
Some things are better on paper.

33:40.740 --> 33:42.070
Oh you think so?

33:58.630 --> 33:59.680
What are you doing?

34:01.630 --> 34:03.060
Well, you know

34:03.330 --> 34:05.560
I listened to what you said the other day.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.960
So I'm trying to write a letter to my wife.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.400
We don't talk to each other much anymore

34:13.639 --> 34:17.699
so I thought maybe I'd try your method.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.670
Randy!

34:49.739 --> 34:50.770
Oh my God!

35:02.220 --> 35:06.680
Arnie! Arnie! Stop! Arnie!

35:17.200 --> 35:19.170
Okay I got. Easy now, watch your back.

35:19.470 --> 35:20.200
You'll be alright, man!

35:36.220 --> 35:39.120
Hello, is that the Memphis Bar and Grill?

35:39.330 --> 35:40.160
It is! Great.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.560
Listen, I wonder if you could help me please.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.860
I'm looking for a young woman called Elizabeth.

35:46.170 --> 35:49.070
Yes. I realize that. I'm not calling to order your food.

35:49.400 --> 35:50.270
I'm sure it's delicious.

35:50.500 --> 35:54.300
I wonder, does a woman called Elizabeth work there?

35:54.540 --> 35:55.630
Elizabeth!

35:56.080 --> 35:56.800
Elizabeth.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.170
That's what I said, Elizabeth.

35:58.410 --> 36:00.110
E- L-I-Z-A-B-

36:01.450 --> 36:02.570
No, alright, thank you.

36:02.780 --> 36:03.510
Thank you.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.950
Good God, it's Jeremy!

36:07.150 --> 36:07.950
Yeah it's me!

36:08.250 --> 36:09.920
I never thought I'd hear your voice again.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.110
Well, you see I got your postcard and...

36:12.390 --> 36:13.620
This sounds ridiculous but...

36:13.860 --> 36:16.120
Well I traced every Memphis bar and grill.

36:16.530 --> 36:17.520
There must be at least ninety.

36:17.830 --> 36:19.230
I know its crazy and...

36:19.500 --> 36:22.160
I just wanted to say thanks for staying in touch.

36:22.370 --> 36:24.030
I miss you. I miss your company.

36:24.370 --> 36:26.400
I never thought I'd hear from you again!

36:28.210 --> 36:29.830
It's not really you is it?

36:30.280 --> 36:31.870
No I know you don't know me.

36:32.610 --> 36:34.200
But your name's Elizabeth.

36:35.150 --> 36:37.080
Well, I just... I just wanted

36:37.650 --> 36:39.910
I just wanted to say hello really, and...

36:40.220 --> 36:41.620
I wanted to speak to my friend.

36:42.820 --> 36:43.650
Yeah.

36:43.860 --> 36:46.450
No no, I don't want to order any fried chicken.

36:47.260 --> 36:48.390
Thanks.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.660
Thanks for listening.

36:51.860 --> 36:52.830
Bye.

36:56.370 --> 36:58.560
Goddamn son of a bitch...

36:59.740 --> 37:00.800
I need to talk to you!

37:01.040 --> 37:02.060
Not in here. Let's take this outside.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.870
No! I want to talk about it right here!

37:06.150 --> 37:08.710
So you feel more like a man now do you?

37:09.250 --> 37:11.440
You feel all big and strong.

37:12.450 --> 37:14.220
I mean you could have killed him!

37:14.450 --> 37:16.650
Yeah, no body ever said sleeping with someone else's wife

37:17.060 --> 37:17.950
was a safe vocation.

37:18.290 --> 37:20.090
Oh goddammit Arnie!

37:20.390 --> 37:22.190
We're, we're separated!

37:22.430 --> 37:23.690
I don't live with you anymore!

37:24.030 --> 37:24.930
I don't talk to you anymore!

37:25.260 --> 37:26.490
You are my goddamn wife!

37:26.770 --> 37:29.200
And I am still your goddamn husband!

37:29.400 --> 37:31.430
No, no you're not...

37:31.670 --> 37:32.760
Not anymore.

37:33.370 --> 37:34.770
Well then what am I?

37:36.210 --> 37:37.540
You're nothing.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.300
Nothing to me.

37:40.750 --> 37:43.440
Sue Lynne, please, please, please baby.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.650
Don't do this, don't do this to me.

37:45.850 --> 37:47.680
I love you, I love you so much.

37:48.020 --> 37:50.420
I just, I just need a little more time.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.350
Goddammit Arnie!

37:52.590 --> 37:55.060
No, no you gotta let me go.

37:55.330 --> 37:57.920
I can't do it anymore. You gotta let me go now.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.290
I'm gonna go, I'm restart my life

38:00.570 --> 38:02.400
and I'm gonna get me a job.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.040
You're gonna get a job, right?

38:04.300 --> 38:05.240
Yes I am.

38:05.510 --> 38:07.030
You don't need a job...

38:07.370 --> 38:09.240
What with all those boyfriends of yours.

38:09.740 --> 38:11.840
All you gotta do is just start charging.

38:12.210 --> 38:14.110
You bastard!

38:15.110 --> 38:17.840
YOU GODDAMN BASTARD!

38:18.120 --> 38:19.410
You bastard Arnie!

38:19.750 --> 38:21.850
I'm through with you!

38:22.260 --> 38:23.650
You hear me? I'm through!

38:24.360 --> 38:27.260
I'm through with you! It is over! It is over!

38:27.660 --> 38:28.990
You understand me?

38:42.910 --> 38:44.100
Sue Lynne,

38:44.980 --> 38:47.670
I swear to god, if you walk out of here,

38:48.150 --> 38:49.410
I'll kill you.

38:58.220 --> 38:59.420
Then what?

39:01.960 --> 39:04.430
Arnie, be calm now...

39:04.700 --> 39:06.390
you don't want to do this.

39:06.730 --> 39:08.170
It's over!

40:32.350 --> 40:33.650
It's too much.

40:33.890 --> 40:34.980
Nuh uh.

40:36.690 --> 40:39.020
No no no...

40:42.160 --> 40:45.860
You're saving up to buy a car, right?

40:48.670 --> 40:52.200
Well, I... I don't want you driving around in some

40:52.910 --> 40:54.030
junker.

40:56.180 --> 41:00.130
So some cop can pull you over for a failed inspection.

41:03.980 --> 41:05.040
Thank you.

41:43.720 --> 41:44.750
Wait.

41:47.360 --> 41:48.490
You forgot these.

42:01.870 --> 42:04.430
Yeah... you can just get rid of those.

42:29.070 --> 42:30.900
The police said it was an accident.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.200
He couldn't see where he was going

42:33.510 --> 42:34.940
and he skidded off the road.

43:33.670 --> 43:35.070
Can you give me a vodka?

43:54.350 --> 43:57.250
This is my first drink in six years.

43:58.360 --> 44:00.990
Haven't touched the stuff for six years.

44:13.940 --> 44:15.600
Hey everybody!

44:15.880 --> 44:18.870
Let's all drink to Arnie Copeland.

44:19.810 --> 44:22.280
He was guardian of our highways

44:22.520 --> 44:26.650
and defender of our freedom!

44:36.460 --> 44:39.160
Well, this stuff tastes pretty darn awful.

44:40.930 --> 44:43.560
But I guess nobody drinks it for the taste, right?

44:45.540 --> 44:46.770
Give me another one.

45:49.070 --> 45:50.760
Cheeseburgers?

45:55.140 --> 45:56.540
Whiskey?

45:58.910 --> 46:00.570
This isn't mine.

46:01.180 --> 46:02.610
It's Arnie's tab.

46:19.370 --> 46:21.830
What am I supposed to do with this?

46:23.640 --> 46:26.330
Put it in a frame and hang it on my wall?

46:31.510 --> 46:33.440
Travis wants you to settle it.

46:37.420 --> 46:38.820
Travis!

46:43.760 --> 46:46.450
What are you giving this to me for!?

46:47.960 --> 46:50.950
This is Arnie's tab, not mine!

46:51.660 --> 46:53.960
Why are you giving this to me!?

46:54.270 --> 46:55.430
He was your husband.

46:55.870 --> 46:57.500
Or does that matter at all?

46:57.800 --> 46:59.600
He's dead!

47:00.740 --> 47:04.200
So if you want your money, you better call his lawyer.

47:04.610 --> 47:06.010
Don't give this to me!

47:06.210 --> 47:08.510
Oh God, what a piece of work you are...

47:08.750 --> 47:11.380
God only knows what Arnie saw in you.

47:11.750 --> 47:14.510
I hate you Travis!

47:17.220 --> 47:18.810
I hate you...

47:23.800 --> 47:24.730
Lizzie!

47:24.960 --> 47:26.730
Make sure she gets home safe.

47:26.970 --> 47:28.060
Go on now.

47:28.600 --> 47:29.620
Go on!

47:44.780 --> 47:46.610
Hey Sue Lynne?

47:50.360 --> 47:51.550
Sue Lynne?

47:53.760 --> 47:55.020
It's late.

47:56.430 --> 47:58.290
Come on let me take you home.

48:14.810 --> 48:16.110
I was

48:17.320 --> 48:20.290
seventeen when he pulled me over.

48:23.690 --> 48:26.280
High as a kite.

48:28.890 --> 48:31.420
"You been drinking, Miss? "

48:33.870 --> 48:35.990
So I smiled.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.800
Bat my eyes.

48:43.310 --> 48:46.000
Who'd have thought we'd be married.

48:49.150 --> 48:51.410
In love with a cop,

48:52.950 --> 48:56.910
and stuck in this godforesaken town.

49:00.530 --> 49:03.620
He was so crazy about me.

49:06.730 --> 49:08.560
I couldn't breathe.

49:12.740 --> 49:14.570
So we tried

49:16.510 --> 49:19.410
drinking our way back into love.

49:22.480 --> 49:25.780
But it never made sense in the morning.

49:29.660 --> 49:31.280
So I ran.

49:34.690 --> 49:37.490
And every time I came back,

49:38.500 --> 49:40.430
he was here.

49:41.500 --> 49:45.490
And he was still crazy about me.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.210
You know,

49:54.550 --> 49:58.310
I used to daydream about him dying.

50:02.450 --> 50:04.950
I thought it was the

50:06.120 --> 50:08.960
only way I'd get clear of him.

50:15.830 --> 50:17.730
You must have hated him.

50:21.210 --> 50:23.040
I didn't hate him.

50:27.710 --> 50:30.050
I just wanted him to

50:32.420 --> 50:34.010
let go of me.

50:36.790 --> 50:38.120
And...

50:41.560 --> 50:43.620
now that he has,

50:49.270 --> 50:51.960
it hurts me more than

50:55.070 --> 50:58.070
anything else in the whole world.

51:10.820 --> 51:12.880
This is where we met.

51:22.100 --> 51:25.070
Right here.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.990
Well, I heard you had a day job

52:30.870 --> 52:32.170
I'm saving for a car

52:32.440 --> 52:36.000
Well, I'm leaving town for good so

52:36.440 --> 52:38.380
I wanted to take care of a few things

52:38.610 --> 52:41.940
Arnie's tab came out to eight hundred dollars

52:43.520 --> 52:45.980
I guess you can give it to Travis and

52:46.220 --> 52:47.620
he can mark the debt paid

52:49.190 --> 52:51.050
I'll give it to Travis tonight

52:52.220 --> 52:54.320
Shock might give him a heart attack

53:10.110 --> 53:12.170
I have a favor to ask you

53:15.750 --> 53:17.610
Could you keep his bill hanging?

53:21.020 --> 53:22.950
So they don't forget him too soon?

53:27.590 --> 53:28.460
OK

53:59.020 --> 54:02.620
I guess for Sue Lynne, leaving this town was like dying

54:06.500 --> 54:09.060
I wonder how people would remember Arnie

54:11.640 --> 54:14.330
When you're gone, all that's left behind are the memories

54:14.640 --> 54:16.440
you created in other people's lives

54:19.180 --> 54:21.480
or just a couple of items on a bill

54:29.960 --> 54:32.790
I began receiving postcards from her regularly

54:33.760 --> 54:37.990
Instead of calling strangers, I decided to change my strategy

54:39.260 --> 54:42.170
It was tiring writing the same words over and over again

54:42.900 --> 54:45.560
but all worth it if only one of them reached her

55:04.220 --> 55:07.250
I always had the feeling I could say anything to you.

55:09.030 --> 55:11.520
Enclosed is a bill I've created for you

55:11.730 --> 55:13.560
in memory of our time together

55:16.100 --> 55:18.330
I wonder how you remember me

55:21.240 --> 55:23.760
As the girl who liked blueberry pies

55:27.450 --> 55:29.380
or the girl with the broken heart?

56:53.730 --> 56:55.600
Still rolling your own cigarettes?

57:01.540 --> 57:02.510
You want one?

57:03.440 --> 57:04.410
Yeah

57:19.690 --> 57:21.090
Tastes different

57:22.290 --> 57:24.460
It's probably just been in my pocket too long

57:29.570 --> 57:32.370
It's a shame you can't smoke in cafes anymore

57:32.670 --> 57:34.370
You can't smoke anywhere anymore

57:36.210 --> 57:38.180
You should've changed the place

57:38.940 --> 57:40.840
It's not that much different

57:41.650 --> 57:43.110
I've been meaning to buy new chairs

57:43.350 --> 57:44.840
but I couldn't never find any that match

57:45.680 --> 57:47.310
the tables and the tiles

57:48.190 --> 57:49.410
Shouldn't be hard

57:50.160 --> 57:52.920
Maybe you're just looking in the wrong places or

57:53.220 --> 57:55.450
maybe you're just sentimental

58:00.030 --> 58:01.430
You look lovely

58:01.730 --> 58:03.670
I'm starting to look like my mom

58:03.870 --> 58:05.430
It's better than looking like your dad

58:05.670 --> 58:06.900
I've seen photos of him

58:16.780 --> 58:18.540
You still have the keys?

58:20.820 --> 58:23.650
Yeah... I always remember what you said

58:23.860 --> 58:25.950
about never throwing them away, about never

58:26.260 --> 58:29.160
closing those doors forever. I remember

58:30.500 --> 58:33.990
Sometimes, even if you have the keys

58:34.770 --> 58:36.560
those doors still

58:37.100 --> 58:39.260
can't be opened, can they?

58:42.470 --> 58:44.240
Even if the door is open

58:44.480 --> 58:46.970
the person you're looking for may not be there, Katya

58:54.520 --> 58:56.750
A few years ago, I had a dream

58:58.560 --> 59:00.180
It began in the summer

59:00.530 --> 59:02.790
and was over by the following spring

59:05.130 --> 59:07.690
In between, there was as many unhappy nights

59:08.000 --> 59:09.430
as there were happy days

59:10.570 --> 59:13.300
Most of them took place in this cafe

59:16.370 --> 59:17.740
And then one night

59:17.940 --> 59:20.070
a door slammed and the dream was over

59:37.660 --> 59:39.320
I should be going

59:40.170 --> 59:42.430
I have to catch a flight in the morning

59:43.440 --> 59:45.340
Thanks for the smoke.

59:53.710 --> 59:56.010
You know, I didn't even think you'd still be here

59:57.050 --> 59:58.140
Why'd you come?

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:06.750
I guess I just wanted to see if I could remember

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.920
what it felt like

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:22.660
Goodbye, Jeremy

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.540
Bye, Katya

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:50.000
Cocktails?

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:51.390
A screwdriver, please

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.330
Here you go

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.770
Dear Jeremy

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:57.670
I've always been fascinated by card players

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.910
They risk everything on their instincts and their luck

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.770
I wonder if I would be able to make the same moves

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.420
in their position

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.480
Or would I just fold?

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.530
Sweetheart, do you mind?

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.420
Uh-oh look at that

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.460
She gets another one this kid

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:23.760
You know Leslie you got that fancy Jag

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.500
you working on a Rolls Royce now?

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.300
Aloha, you forgot to tip the waitress

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.300
Actually I didn't forget dick

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.540
Because I never tip

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.300
What do you mean you never tip?

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.950
I mean Harlan can afford to pay his own people

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.010
I don't know why I have to

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.680
You can be cheap or you can be lucky

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.480
but you can't be both. Not in the long run

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.240
Here ya go, toots

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.050
That is from Mr. Aloha over there

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:49.760
He's gonna pay me back, he doesn't know it yet

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.630
Thanks

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.390
Your luck just went south

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.890
Who's blinds?

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.900
Working long hours in the casino makes you lose track of the time

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:05.270
And I'm never sure whether it's day or night

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.410
But at least I don't have to worry about my sleeping problem anymore

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.120
Somehow it's gone away

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:25.490
How much you got left, sweet cheeks?

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.760
Because that's what I bet

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.300
Eighteen-twenty

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.940
You on a big draw, Aloha?

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.740
Because otherwise you're just about dead

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.920
You are on a big draw

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:54.880
Twelve outs twice

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.520
You wanna do business?

01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:57.850
Make me an offer

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.160
How about you take six hundred and I take a thousand

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:01.730
and we gamble for the rest?

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.060
I say I need more than that

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:05.430
Doesn't seem fair to you?

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:06.640
I feel like gambling

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.030
So what do you want me to do?

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:09.700
You heard the man.

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:12.780
He wants to gamble. Deal

01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:19.810
Bet you wish you took that six hundred now,huh Aloha?

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:22.550
Don't get too cocky little girl

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:24.240
Five of hearts still in that deck

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.680
Oh come on

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.590
We can all dream, Aloha

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.260
I wish you luck

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.360
Why don't you deal the card?

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:34.330
Fine

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.800
Wait, wait, how did you do that?

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:42.870
Ok I swear I wasn't cheating

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.370
I had the deck in my hand

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.640
Pass it to the sugardaddy here

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:49.840
I'm telling my grandkids about that one

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.850
Maybe

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.220
A salad. That'd be healthy, right?

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.550
I don't think I could get it down though

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.350
All that chewing and swallowing

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.460
Maybe I'll get some eggs

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:11.530
Protein, right?

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.830
How would you like them?

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.270
Tied in a knot and nailed to the floor

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.870
Or maybe you can just crack 'em over my head

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.870
and let 'em trickle down my cheeks

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:24.610
Beth

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.380
Why don't I just go ask them right now?

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.490
So who is gonna lend me a grand so I can get back in?

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.860
Sam, come on, this is me we're talking about

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.030
Why can't you just advance me the cash

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:47.070
and I will wire you back the money within 24 hours

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:49.470
You won't even have a chance to miss it

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.000
Yeah?

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.140
Well fuck you very much!

01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.840
Rough night, huh?

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:01.350
You could say that

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.750
How did you wind up in this hellhole?

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.650
The bus just dropped me off here

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:09.720
Where'd you come from?

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:10.830
New York

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.720
You came all the way here from New York on a bus?

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:15.530
Sounds awful

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.100
Actually, I was on quite a few of them

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.000
You must love buses

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.440
I wanna get a car but

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:26.770
it's not easy saving money

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.840
How much you got?

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:31.780
About twenty-one, twenty-two hundred

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:38.110
Hey Beth

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.090
I've got a proposition for you

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.850
What kind of proposition?

01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:46.820
See, I need a stake

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.830
There's a man I could call in Vegas

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:52.030
but I don't want to do that

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.230
I'm gonna win that game

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.570
I'm a stronger player than any of them

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.540
If you give me a chance I'm gonna clean their clocks.

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:05.220
How much do you need?

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:08.340
Well your twenty two hundred would get me back in

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:11.550
And then, once I cash out

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.620
you'll get your money back plus a third of my winnings

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:17.630
But what if you lose?

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.630
If I lose, you get my car

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.130
It's a brand new Jag

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:27.670
This way

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.130
whatever happens

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.740
you've got your ass covered from here to Houston

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:37.980
You got to give me a minute here

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.950
It's been a long night

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.620
I got an empty stomach. Just give me a minute

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:49.190
You take your time

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:51.900
I wouldn't want you choking on your food

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:55.560
Shit it's cold!

01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:56.790
I know

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.130
I'll do it

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:35.230
Oh my, look who's back

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:39.010
I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas in that fancy ass Jag of yours

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.470
I figure why not let you pay for my gas

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.240
Gotta raise again

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.100
Five hundred

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.170
Oh one of these days one of us is going to have

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.840
something when you raise!

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.380
Listen, why don't you just wink at me when that happens

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.910
so I know, alright?

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:13.600
Raise

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:17.870
I'm all in

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:27.850
You want to give me a count on that?

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:32.620
Fifteen... Fifteen thirty-five

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:38.149
Too rich for me

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.300
I don't know what's worse

01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:54.470
That cute smile or that ugly shirt

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.240
I'll give you some action

01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:10.630
Hey

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:14.460
Hey, what happened?

01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:16.530
The car's yours

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:19.930
You've got to give me a ride though

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:33.570
So where we going?

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.750
Vegas

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.920
She said she knew some people in Vegas who could stake her

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.790
get her started again

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:49.120
But she didn't seem to be in a hurry to get there

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.830
Hey Leslie, are you asleep?

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.540
No

01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:04.010
I keep playing old poker hands in my head

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.610
You?

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.210
Same

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:10.420
Except for the poker

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.350
What are you replaying?

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.450
Just some stuff that happened back in New York

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.100
Hey, the man you told me about in Vegas

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:24.530
that could give you the money

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.130
Yeah?

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.300
Is he a boyfriend?

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:30.900
No

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.400
I haven't had very much luck with boyfriends

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.940
I've had a few but

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.700
none that I could ever ask for anything, let alone money

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:45.680
Now you want to know who the man in Vegas is

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.460
but you're too polite to ask

01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:48.680
No

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.490
It's not important

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.630
He's my father

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.430
Taught me how to play poker

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.030
He had me figuring odds around the same time

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.240
other kids were learning how to count

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:06.440
He used to tell people

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.240
that I thought the number that came after ten

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:10.670
was Jack

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:17.990
So I can ask him for money or anything, but

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.750
I won't

01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:38.840
Trust everyone but always cut the cards

01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:41.070
Best thing my father ever taught me

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.240
You know what that means?

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:46.110
It means never trust anybody

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.650
If you're so good at reading people

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:49.720
Then why did I lose?

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:50.850
Yeah

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:53.050
Because you can't always win

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:55.920
You can beat players but you can't beat luck

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:58.620
Sometimes your rhythm's off

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.620
you read the person right but still do the wrong thing

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:02.870
Because you trust them?

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:05.830
Because you can't even trust yourself

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.700
Shit

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.870
Nobody I want to hear from

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.770
Nobody?

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.100
Nobody!

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.080
How did you get this number?

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.160
You know this is the third time this month I've have change it?

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.130
Just leave me the hell alone! Stop calling!

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:41.330
Dammit!

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:43.400
Beth, answer it for me

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.010
What do you want me to say?

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:47.300
Tell them its the wrong number and not to call again

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:48.440
Okay

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.970
Hello?

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.510
Sorry, you have-

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.850
From where?

01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:58.680
Okay

01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:02.260
Okay... you sure?

01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:06.030
Okay, thank you... bye

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.300
It was someone from a hospital in Vegas

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.370
They said your dad's there

01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:16.960
And they said he's dying

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.200
Son of a bitch

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.270
That man... always dying

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:36.380
It's a trick, okay?

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.960
He's pulled this on me before

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.330
Says he has to see me, he's dying

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:42.430
And then

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.630
you know how many times I've fallen for that?

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.130
But it was someone from the hospital that called it wasn't him

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.530
So what Beth?

01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:50.470
You think he couldn't pay someone

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.300
to make the phone call for him?

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:56.710
I swear, is there anyone you don't trust?

01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:00.740
Well he must really want to see you to make up a story like that

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.210
Geez, you are just dying to ask me something

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.240
What?

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:31.340
I didn't say anything

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.350
You didn't have to. I can read you

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.980
I can even guess what you wanna ask

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:37.810
You wanna ask

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:41.920
"What if he is dying? " "What if the message is legit? "

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.230
Well what if he is?

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.830
The thing is Beth

01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:50.600
I don't care

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:52.560
He lives, he dies

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.730
whatever

01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:56.930
I don't fucking care

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.810
You're lying

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:31.040
I'm not going in there

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:31.970
What?

01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:34.800
I can't. What- what if I go in there

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.710
and he's just sitting up in his room

01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:40.240
with his dead beat friends playing gin rummy

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.750
or, I dunno, detoxing, getting a mole removed

01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:46.110
You know it's more serious than that

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.420
No, I don't know that and neither do you

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.460
Listen, you do me a favor. You go in there for me

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:56.630
Me?

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:58.630
Why me?

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.030
Because you are safe. There's no way he can hurt you

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.600
Go, c'mon

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.320
Fine

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.590
I am sorry

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.960
You know we tried to phone a couple days

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.630
but couldn't seem to reach you

01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:33.130
He was-

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.200
You should've come earlier

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.110
He put you up to this!?

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:48.750
How much he pay you huh!?

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:49.940
Jesus

01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:52.180
You're so good at reading people?

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.010
Can't you see it in my face!?

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.190
Leslie, he's gone!

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.400
You're lying

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:14.830
Beth

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:17.640
I can't give you the car

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:21.600
Why?

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:24.210
Because the car

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.650
the car belonged to my father

01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:36.090
Look, he won big one day in a Hold'em game at the Riviera, and

01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:40.360
went out and bought the next day

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.190
It was his pride and joy

01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:48.840
Til one day I stole his keys, and an hour later I stole his car

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:51.570
I don't know why I did it

01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:52.970
Maybe I just

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.670
wanted to see what he would do, you know?

01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:57.140
Was he gonna report it?

01:19:57.610 --> 01:19:59.580
Get his daughter arrested?

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.750
He did something better than that

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.950
He waited until he found out where I wound up

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:10.320
One morning

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.990
a FedEx guy comes with an envelope for me

01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:16.170
Inside the envelope's the title and registration of the car

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.970
Son of a bitch signed it over to me

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.000
So

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.610
I'm gonna drive this car until it falls apart

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.210
At least until I do

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:40.060
So what am I supposed to?

01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:43.780
Well, Beth

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.120
I told you I lost everything back at Harlan's, didn't I?

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:49.390
Yeah

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:52.730
Well, that's not exactly how it went down

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:57.030
See, I beat that game on its ass, Beth

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.410
I knocked them off their feet

01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:04.180
The cards turned just like I knew they would

01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:06.640
I read the other players just right

01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:11.710
I walked away with all their money

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.480
So you lied to me

01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:17.690
Maybe I didn't want to share

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:21.630
Maybe I just wanted to see how trusting and gullible you were

01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:26.830
Maybe I just wanted company. You know?

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.800
It's a long ride, Beth

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:32.440
I didn't want to go alone

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:13.780
Can't do it. Thirty-five hundred's the best I can give ya

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:16.180
Three thousand. That's my top

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:18.790
Can't. Gotta have thirty-five hundred. Sorry

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.580
Thirty-two hundred. Take it or leave it

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:21.480
You know what?

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:24.290
I'm sure we can find a better deal someplace else. Let's go

01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:26.690
I don't think you will, ladies. Suit yourselves

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.860
Thank you!

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:30.770
Don't look back

01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:32.000
Beth, where are you going?

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:33.070
I want that car

01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:34.200
Beth not at that price!

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.130
We can get it for three grand by the time we get to my car

01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:39.670
I don't think he's gonna come down

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.000
And I think that's the car I want

01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:46.080
Have you learned nothing from your time with me?

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:49.120
You have to stop taking people at their word!

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:51.450
Maybe you should start

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:55.620
You're hopeless

01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:57.990
You're hopeless too

01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:16.110
Dear Jeremy

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.340
In the last few days, I've been learning how to not trust people

01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:22.440
and I'm glad I failed

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:35.520
Sometimes we depend on other people as a mirror

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.500
To define us and tell us who we are

01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:43.500
And each reflection makes me like myself a little more

01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:46.380
Elizabeth

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.370
Hello, Cafe Klyuch

01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:55.940
Rent

01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:42.620
You still open?

01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:45.730
No reason for me to still be here if I wasn't

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.460
I heard this place has the best coffee and pie in town

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:51.630
Where'd you hear that?

01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:54.100
I get around

01:25:57.610 --> 01:25:58.800
You wanna come inside?

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:01.440
It's cold

01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:03.710
What are you doing out here? It's freezing

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.250
It's a beautiful night. I wanted to get some fresh air

01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:08.880
Have a seat

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.190
Isn't this reserved?

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.090
Reserved for you

01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.600
Want something to eat?

01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:29.060
Yeah, I'm starving

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:31.570
What's good tonight?

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.440
What about a steak?

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.670
That sounds good

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:39.180
Does it come with home fries?

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.410
Or mashed

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.880
They both sound good

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:43.750
Half an order of both?

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.820
I'll get the home fries with the steak, medium rare

01:26:48.090 --> 01:26:50.180
and a side of mashed potatoes

01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:51.720
Coming right up

01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:05.970
Learning something about me?

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.710
There's something different about you

01:27:10.150 --> 01:27:11.740
Or maybe it's me that's changed

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:16.020
Where are the keys?

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.550
You don't keep them anymore?

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:21.550
Been trying to give them back to their owners

01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:22.950
Do you want yours?

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:25.820
No. I don't need them anymore

01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:29.960
What about your keys?

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:33.730
I got rid of them

01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:38.100
Good night, Jeremy

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.500
I'll see you tomorrow

01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:56.520
You know I came here the night I left

01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:59.350
but I didn't make it past the front door

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:06.290
I almost walked in but I knew that if I did

01:28:06.570 --> 01:28:09.330
I would just be the same old Elizabeth

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.770
I didn't want to be that person anymore

01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:28.780
Hope you enjoy it

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.230
Are they still left untouched at the end of the night?

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.270
Yep, more or less

01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:47.330
Then why do you keep making them?

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.380
Well I always like having one around just in case

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:56.440
you pop in and fancy a slice

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.160
Do you remember that last night you were here?

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:08.560
When you practically ate an entire pie all by yourself?

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.860
Really?

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.530
I remember getting really drunk and

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.570
having a god awful hangover the next day

01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:20.700
Nothing else?

01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:25.810
No, nothing else

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.350
Or don't you have a tape I can watch?

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.090
I do... but...

01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:39.390
I've watched it so many times

01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:41.390
that the picture started fading to black and white

01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:44.060
And now it's completely unwatchable

01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:45.360
Must have been an interesting night

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.400
It was

01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:55.180
Never seen a girl eat so much in all my life

01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:59.470
Like this?

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.440
No, it was more like this

01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:14.130
It's good pie

01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:44.580
It took me nearly a year to get here

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.930
It wasn't so hard to cross that street afterall

01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:54.690
It all depends on who's waiting for you on the other side
