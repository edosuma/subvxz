01:52.840 --> 01:54.120
The conquest

01:54.121 --> 01:55.400
of a truscan fiesole

01:55.440 --> 01:56.660
occured throughout

01:56.661 --> 01:57.880
the first century B.C.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.180
First it was a conquest

01:59.181 --> 02:00.440
of Portio Catone

02:00.480 --> 02:01.840
followed by the defeat of

02:01.841 --> 02:03.200
the city after it's alliance

02:03.240 --> 02:05.080
with the Catalina.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.600
[Violetta] Even on a field trip,

02:06.601 --> 02:08.080
she brings that book.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.759
I read a book once.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.140
I don't see

02:11.141 --> 02:12.480
what the big deal is.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.660
[Violetta] It's like

02:13.661 --> 02:14.800
she never puts it down.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.060
She sleeps with it

02:16.061 --> 02:17.280
under her pillow.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.120
Sometimes on top of her pillow.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.000
How does that not hurt?

02:23.040 --> 02:24.240
That's right.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.960
You're her roommate.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.940
I sometimes forget,

02:27.941 --> 02:29.880
we have an insider.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.560
- It's time
- you made yourself useful.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.640
- You mean I haven't been useful
- up 'til now?

02:36.520 --> 02:38.040
Not really, no.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.280
Uh...

02:41.280 --> 02:42.540
[tour guide] Public baths were

02:42.541 --> 02:43.800
constructed in the same period

02:43.840 --> 02:45.520
and the covered areas and pools

02:45.521 --> 02:47.200
are still visible today.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.560
The Etruscan Temple,

02:48.600 --> 02:51.000
erected in the 4th century B.C.,

02:51.040 --> 02:52.960
was dedicated to Minerva.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.680
Let's talk.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.840
- Alright...
- there's no hard-wired connection

02:56.880 --> 02:57.900
Between the book

02:57.901 --> 02:58.920
and the bracelet.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.680
I don't know...

03:01.681 --> 03:02.720
the link just happened.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.320
[Paula] Hi!

03:06.400 --> 03:08.360
It's me. Paula.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.720
Your roommate.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.040
Yeah. I recognized you from...

03:13.080 --> 03:14.100
all the other times

03:14.101 --> 03:15.120
I've seen you.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.600
Excuse us.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.480
- This way
- to the Etruscan temple everyone.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.160
Feel free to explore.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.040
Anyway, I was thinking roommates

03:30.080 --> 03:32.600
should really be best friends.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.160
It's practically a rule.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.580
So we should

03:36.581 --> 03:37.960
really hang out and...

03:38.000 --> 03:39.520
do things.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.976
- You know,
- that's a really good idea,

03:41.000 --> 03:42.520
Let's do that sometime!

03:46.480 --> 03:48.800
Sometime other than now.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.600
[whip crack]

03:56.560 --> 03:58.360
I'm sure we have lots in common.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.000
We just need to talk more!

04:02.040 --> 04:05.040
You know, clothes, music...

04:05.080 --> 04:06.640
- books.
- Subtle.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.720
Thank you!

04:09.600 --> 04:10.640
[clears throat]

04:14.560 --> 04:15.960
What's that?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.320
[gasps] Nothing.

04:17.321 --> 04:18.640
I just got a text.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.480
Um, Vincent, we should...

04:25.000 --> 04:26.440
Where are we going?

04:28.440 --> 04:29.560
What's the rush?

04:29.600 --> 04:30.720
Wait up!

04:41.200 --> 04:43.000
Forgive me for this.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.520
OW! Hey!

04:45.560 --> 04:46.720
- I didn't get it!

04:46.721 --> 04:47.880
- Get what?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.120
I was gonna ask the same thing.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.580
Vincent, you told me you were

04:51.581 --> 04:53.000
gonna get them all off you

04:53.040 --> 04:54.680
before we came out here.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.480
- If you're gonna mess around
- with insects,

04:56.520 --> 04:58.216
- You gotta make sure
- you get them all back

04:58.240 --> 04:59.520
Into their tank.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.520
You could get Sweaty Fever.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.800
[gasps] Look, they're

05:02.801 --> 05:04.040
getting away!

05:04.080 --> 05:05.960
Ooh... oh...

05:07.400 --> 05:08.680
I...

05:08.681 --> 05:09.960
should be getting back to...

05:10.000 --> 05:11.600
the other direction.

05:14.920 --> 05:15.960
[laugh]

05:34.880 --> 05:36.600
I don't understand this.

05:36.601 --> 05:38.320
It's just one word.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.840
That can't be right, can it?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.000
- Vincent...
- What?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.840
- You already told me
- what happens.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.080
Don't send me out this time.

05:49.081 --> 05:50.280
I really wanna see!

05:50.320 --> 05:51.380
Fine. But keep an eye out

05:51.381 --> 05:52.440
while I'm gone, okay?

05:52.480 --> 05:55.160
Yes! Alright, I'm on it.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.240
Go!

05:57.440 --> 05:59.320
Go! I gotta see this!

05:59.360 --> 06:00.440
Engage!

06:04.520 --> 06:05.800
Mia?

06:05.840 --> 06:07.680
What is it?

06:09.760 --> 06:11.720
I don't like the sound of this.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.400
Hi Mia.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.000
Say your password.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.520
"Sacrifice."

06:31.880 --> 06:34.080
[screams]

06:38.360 --> 06:40.440
I'm going to fly this time...

06:40.480 --> 06:42.160
Huh? Whoa whoa whoa!

06:42.200 --> 06:46.080
Ahhhhhh!

06:46.120 --> 06:48.720
Ugh! Oh!

06:48.760 --> 06:50.080
Aah!

06:50.120 --> 06:51.800
Phew!

06:51.840 --> 06:54.000
[snorts and neighs]

06:54.040 --> 06:56.120
Oh Lyria, you're okay!

06:56.160 --> 06:57.260
The new oracle...

06:57.261 --> 06:58.360
I was so worried.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.560
Where's Onchao?

07:01.600 --> 07:02.840
[neighs]

07:15.480 --> 07:16.720
Woah!

07:26.640 --> 07:28.320
He's so amazing!

07:29.200 --> 07:30.400
[neighs]

07:31.800 --> 07:33.040
[neighs back]

07:37.880 --> 07:39.400
- [snorts]
- [gasps]

07:39.440 --> 07:41.960
Really? He made... all this?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.400
His own oasis.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.000
Wow!

07:45.040 --> 07:46.960
Hey, Onchao, can you show me?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.440
[neighs]

07:49.880 --> 07:50.920
[snorts]

07:53.920 --> 07:55.240
[laughs]

08:01.880 --> 08:03.120
[laughs]

08:08.480 --> 08:10.800
CROAK! CROAK!

08:12.320 --> 08:14.280
That looks like so much fun!

08:14.320 --> 08:16.440
Wanna play leap frog?

08:16.480 --> 08:17.800
Woah!

08:18.800 --> 08:19.840
[laughs]

08:21.840 --> 08:23.680
Woohooo!! Yoopi!

08:23.720 --> 08:25.560
[laughs]

08:25.600 --> 08:26.960
Wooohooo!

08:30.200 --> 08:32.840
[laughs]

08:32.880 --> 08:34.360
This is... great!

08:34.400 --> 08:36.400
Mo and Yuko have to see this.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.039
DING!

08:38.080 --> 08:40.400
Whoah woah woah!

08:40.440 --> 08:42.039
Thanks Onchao.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.120
You're the best friend ever.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.360
You know what that means?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.640
Tag! You're it!

08:46.680 --> 08:47.920
[laughs]

08:49.200 --> 08:51.880
That means you have to chase me!

08:51.920 --> 08:53.120
[neighs]

08:54.120 --> 08:55.560
[laughs]

08:56.280 --> 08:57.800
[neighs]

09:01.560 --> 09:03.120
[laughs]

09:07.880 --> 09:09.080
There you are!

09:09.120 --> 09:10.200
Hey Onchao!

09:11.920 --> 09:13.240
[snorts]

09:13.280 --> 09:14.600
What's he doing?

09:17.080 --> 09:18.200
[neighs]

09:18.240 --> 09:20.160
- Now, you're it!
- [laughs]

09:20.200 --> 09:22.280
Ahh tag!

09:25.640 --> 09:27.640
Whoa! Stop for a second.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.920
Okay. What?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.880
First, tag you're it.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.080
[laughs]

09:32.120 --> 09:33.560
But more importantly,

09:33.600 --> 09:36.120
where did all this come from?

09:36.160 --> 09:38.120
- This place
- was never here before.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.680
I know!

09:39.681 --> 09:41.200
Onchao made this whole oasis.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.680
Just like that.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.080
[Mo] How did he do that?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.320
Hey Mia, was there a new oracle?

09:47.360 --> 09:49.440
Uh yeah... there was.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.520
[neighing]

09:52.000 --> 09:53.760
Where's Onchao going now?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.200
Let's go see.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.040
[sniffs]

10:14.120 --> 10:15.680
[sniffs]

10:15.720 --> 10:16.880
I think

10:16.881 --> 10:18.040
he's making something grow.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.120
No, he's just digging.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.680
Is there something down there?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.040
Just a piece of junk.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.080
Maybe I'm crazy,

10:34.120 --> 10:35.896
- but it looks like
- a piece of the Trumptus.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.680
- What!
- Hey! Ugh!

10:37.720 --> 10:39.160
- I saw it first!
- Just let me look!

10:39.200 --> 10:40.360
Ha ha! No way!

10:40.400 --> 10:42.520
Yuko I have it. It's mine!

10:42.560 --> 10:44.160
Come on! Let me see!

10:44.200 --> 10:45.360
[grunts]

10:45.400 --> 10:47.800
Guys, stop! I'm positive.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.960
- I put all the pieces together
- with Phuddle.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.140
But it doesn't look anything

10:51.141 --> 10:52.280
like the Trumptus.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.280
[sniffs]

11:01.680 --> 11:02.960
Now it does!

11:03.000 --> 11:05.080
How did he do that?

11:05.120 --> 11:07.000
That was great, Onchao!

11:08.040 --> 11:09.720
[neighs]

11:09.760 --> 11:11.240
Y'know what this means?

11:11.280 --> 11:12.776
- Onchao can help us find
- the Trumptus,

11:12.800 --> 11:14.120
Piece by piece.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.640
[neighs]

11:19.680 --> 11:21.120
[Yuko laughs]

11:21.160 --> 11:22.420
Aaah...

11:22.421 --> 11:23.680
I was just thinking of Panthea.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.360
Remember how smug she looked

11:25.400 --> 11:27.680
- when she thought
- she'd destroyed the Trumptus?

11:27.720 --> 11:29.020
Or would have looked,

11:29.021 --> 11:30.320
if she had a face!

11:33.360 --> 11:34.920
[Yuko] (ECHOED) Look at this,

11:34.921 --> 11:36.480
Panthea!

11:47.600 --> 11:49.920
I have a strange feeling

11:49.921 --> 11:52.240
someone is taunting me.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.600
Was it you?

11:53.640 --> 11:55.920
Me? Never, my Queen!

11:55.960 --> 11:57.960
I live only to serve you!

11:58.000 --> 12:00.460
Your victory over this island

12:00.461 --> 12:02.920
leaves me in constant awe!

12:02.960 --> 12:04.720
Ah, good.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.840
Although I...

12:06.880 --> 12:08.320
I should mention that

12:08.321 --> 12:09.760
we've noticed new plants

12:09.800 --> 12:11.340
are springing up

12:11.341 --> 12:12.880
all over your conquered lands.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.140
What?! Undoing all the wonderful

12:15.141 --> 12:17.360
damage I've done?!

12:17.400 --> 12:18.680
Go find out

12:18.681 --> 12:19.960
who's doing that and stop them!

12:20.000 --> 12:23.520
And use unnecessary force!

12:23.560 --> 12:25.000
Ugh!

12:25.040 --> 12:26.200
If you find the ones

12:26.201 --> 12:27.360
taunting me,

12:27.400 --> 12:29.400
taunt them harder!

12:34.960 --> 12:36.520
- [Mo] If the Trumptus
- still exists,

12:36.560 --> 12:37.880
Even in pieces,

12:37.920 --> 12:39.400
it could save Centopia!

12:39.440 --> 12:41.200
This is amazing!

12:41.240 --> 12:42.380
Onchao, can you sense

12:42.381 --> 12:43.520
any more of those pieces?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.840
- [snorts]
- [Yuko] Well then

12:46.880 --> 12:48.816
- We've gotta take him
- over every inch of this island

12:48.840 --> 12:49.960
Until he finds them all!

12:50.000 --> 12:51.120
Come on, Onchao!

12:53.520 --> 12:55.020
Try to imagine

12:55.021 --> 12:56.520
how many inches that is.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.120
There has to be a better way.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.880
Wait! Look at Onchao!

13:01.560 --> 13:02.600
[sniffs]

13:02.640 --> 13:03.680
[neighs slightly]

13:04.400 --> 13:05.440
[sniffs]

13:06.320 --> 13:07.480
[neighs louder]

13:07.520 --> 13:08.720
Hey, where are you going?

13:08.760 --> 13:10.240
Maybe he senses another one!

13:10.280 --> 13:11.520
Come on!

13:16.360 --> 13:18.480
[neighs]

13:18.520 --> 13:19.720
Aw.

13:19.721 --> 13:20.921
It's just the woodland herd...

13:23.120 --> 13:24.280
[neighs]

13:39.000 --> 13:40.200
[neighs]

13:47.320 --> 13:48.560
[neighs]

13:48.600 --> 13:49.760
[neighs back]

13:56.520 --> 13:58.560
[all unicorns neigh]

14:02.840 --> 14:04.520
He's just like them.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.900
Except maybe

14:05.901 --> 14:07.240
for the golden horn and wings.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.840
[snorts hesitantly]

14:17.880 --> 14:19.040
[Mia] C'mon Onchao!

14:19.080 --> 14:20.480
You can do it!

14:30.440 --> 14:32.880
He flew! For the first time!

14:32.920 --> 14:34.040
Just like that!

14:34.080 --> 14:35.920
He's really good!

14:35.960 --> 14:37.280
Better than you already.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.360
[neighs]

14:46.440 --> 14:47.720
[snorts]

14:47.760 --> 14:49.400
Did you see that?

14:49.440 --> 14:50.760
Hopefully no one else did.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.240
- [dragons shrieking]
- Oh no!

14:52.280 --> 14:54.320
Look! Munc attack!

15:00.840 --> 15:02.680
- Let's get these unicorns
- to safety.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.120
Hyah! Go! Into the trees!

15:09.160 --> 15:11.240
Now! Munculus are coming!

15:11.280 --> 15:12.840
We better do what he says!

15:18.960 --> 15:20.240
[neighing]

15:24.720 --> 15:25.800
[neighing fearfully]

15:29.560 --> 15:31.120
There's unicorns

15:31.121 --> 15:32.680
around here somewhere...

15:32.720 --> 15:34.240
[sniffs]

15:34.280 --> 15:37.200
I can smell them!

15:37.240 --> 15:38.600
C'mon!

15:42.440 --> 15:44.280
They didn't see us. We're okay.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.500
For now...

15:45.501 --> 15:46.680
These guys better be careful.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.120
[neighs]

15:51.160 --> 15:52.240
[neighs back]

15:54.760 --> 15:55.940
[Mia] You'll play with them

15:55.941 --> 15:57.120
again, I promise, Onchao.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.416
- But right now we have to take
- this piece of the Trumptus

15:59.440 --> 16:00.560
To the castle.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.560
[neighs]

16:21.400 --> 16:22.660
Relax Onchao,

16:22.661 --> 16:23.920
we're almost at the castle.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.640
He just wants to play.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.240
[snorts and neighs loudly]

16:34.280 --> 16:36.080
- [Mia] The woodland herd
- is in danger!

16:39.080 --> 16:40.640
- Fly with us!
- Uh!

16:44.560 --> 16:47.240
Over there! Muncs circling.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.000
- [Yuko] We have to protect
- the herd!

16:49.040 --> 16:50.720
- [Mia] And we can't let them
- see Onchao!

16:53.320 --> 16:54.800
It's okay Onchao.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.640
- Mo and Yuko
- can protect the herd!

16:56.680 --> 16:58.000
I hope...

17:02.000 --> 17:03.320
[neighing nervously]

17:05.160 --> 17:08.520
[hissing and neighing]

17:08.560 --> 17:10.640
[Gargona] Ha ha! That's it.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.240
Exhaust them.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.680
Then they'll be ours

17:13.681 --> 17:15.079
for the picking!

17:15.119 --> 17:16.240
Pick this!

17:16.280 --> 17:17.319
FSHHH!

17:17.359 --> 17:19.520
[growls]

17:19.560 --> 17:21.720
- We've got to get these unicorns
- to safety.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.840
[dragon shrieks]

17:38.280 --> 17:39.500
You're just going

17:39.501 --> 17:40.720
to have to trust me.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.480
Hya! Go!

17:50.840 --> 17:52.360
- FSHHHH
- [dragon shrieks]

17:52.400 --> 17:54.440
That's it! Follow the leader!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.480
- Hi there!
- FSHHHH!

17:59.800 --> 18:01.120
[shrieks in surrender]

18:02.840 --> 18:03.880
[neighing]

18:06.120 --> 18:07.340
- I think they're safe now.

18:07.341 --> 18:08.560
- I guess Gargona wasn't

18:08.600 --> 18:10.200
in the mood to fight today.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.440
That's not like her.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.600
[dragon growls]

18:13.640 --> 18:14.640
[Yuko] I knew it!

18:14.641 --> 18:15.641
There she is!

18:15.680 --> 18:17.260
That's where Onchao

18:17.261 --> 18:18.840
and Lyria are! Come on!

18:27.760 --> 18:30.440
Where did those unicorns go?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.680
[neighs]

18:33.720 --> 18:35.280
I am holding Onchao.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.720
As tight as I can.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.520
[neighs]

18:38.560 --> 18:40.640
- Of course
- I'll always Look after Onchao.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.480
- But why...?
- [snorts]

18:48.840 --> 18:50.680
Ah ha!

18:55.640 --> 18:57.000
No Lyria!

18:57.040 --> 18:58.360
[neighs]

19:01.920 --> 19:03.440
Hya!

19:04.800 --> 19:07.040
Lyria, no! You'll be trapped!

19:09.200 --> 19:10.840
[laughs]

19:10.880 --> 19:12.200
- SLAP!
- [neighs]

19:12.240 --> 19:13.360
[gasps] No!

19:13.400 --> 19:14.600
[neighs in pain]

19:17.000 --> 19:18.200
[Gargona] Ha ha!

19:19.240 --> 19:20.320
Lyria!

19:20.360 --> 19:21.480
[neighs]

19:21.520 --> 19:23.000
[laughs maniacally]

19:25.320 --> 19:26.680
I'm going after her!

19:26.720 --> 19:27.840
I'm right behind you!

19:28.840 --> 19:30.800
[laughs]

19:32.720 --> 19:34.560
Get out of my way!

19:36.800 --> 19:38.360
Just blow through!

19:41.560 --> 19:42.600
SLAP!

19:42.640 --> 19:44.280
Ugh! Woah!

19:52.720 --> 19:54.760
I've got to save Lyria!

19:54.800 --> 19:55.820
- You can't.

19:55.821 --> 19:56.840
- Yes I can!

19:57.880 --> 19:59.040
[grunts with effort]

20:00.200 --> 20:01.800
It's too late, Mia.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.160
You can't go.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.960
Onchao needs you.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.440
Right now more than ever.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.680
[neighs]

20:09.800 --> 20:10.920
[sobs]

20:13.960 --> 20:15.520
[neighs]

20:15.560 --> 20:16.580
He wants to know

20:16.581 --> 20:17.600
where his mother is.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.400
I never told you the new oracle.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.480
But I just found out

20:23.481 --> 20:24.520
what it meant.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.200
"Sacrifice."

20:39.600 --> 20:40.980
That was the sacrifice

20:40.981 --> 20:42.360
the oracle warned of.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.780
Lyria sacrificed herself

20:43.781 --> 20:45.160
to protect Onchao.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.120
I just want you both to know

20:49.121 --> 20:50.520
that, no matter what,

20:50.560 --> 20:53.000
- we're not going to let anything
- happen to Onchao.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.400
Onchao, you're very special

20:54.401 --> 20:55.760
to all of us.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.040
I'm never going

20:57.041 --> 20:58.280
to stop looking after you.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.600
Is that okay with you?

20:59.640 --> 21:00.920
[neighs]

21:08.200 --> 21:09.540
You don't know

21:09.541 --> 21:10.880
how happy that makes me feel.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.960
- Eeh...
- Let me see if I understand.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.280
You say Onchao stumbled on...

21:23.320 --> 21:24.960
No, no, no, no Father!

21:25.000 --> 21:26.120
Onchao seemed to sense

21:26.121 --> 21:27.240
where it was.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.720
He'll be able to find

21:28.721 --> 21:30.160
all the pieces of the Trumptus.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.640
If I calculate right,

21:31.641 --> 21:33.080
there should be nineteen more!

21:33.120 --> 21:34.320
If he finds them all,

21:34.321 --> 21:35.520
I'll put it back together

21:35.560 --> 21:37.440
better than ever!

21:38.440 --> 21:39.840
[snorts slightly]

21:39.880 --> 21:41.640
- How about just the same
- as before?

21:41.680 --> 21:43.640
I see. I see.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.640
Well, not entirely.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.160
But I do see one thing.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.880
Despite our terrible loss,

21:48.920 --> 21:50.400
this truly is a day of hope

21:50.401 --> 21:51.880
for Centopia.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.120
This little unicorn

21:53.121 --> 21:54.320
might just save us all.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.280
Onchao, it would be an honour

21:57.320 --> 21:58.680
to have you live with us

21:58.681 --> 22:00.040
here in the castle.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.800
Really? You'd let him?

22:03.720 --> 22:04.800
Did you hear that?

22:04.840 --> 22:06.680
[neighs]

22:06.720 --> 22:08.240
Aww no,

22:09.080 --> 22:10.920
not now.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.240
Bye Onchao!

22:12.280 --> 22:14.480
I'll be back soon, I promise.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.320
Wow! That is cool!

22:24.360 --> 22:26.220
That is

22:26.221 --> 22:28.080
the most incredible thing

22:28.120 --> 22:29.680
I have ever seen...

22:31.960 --> 22:33.160
Mia?

22:33.200 --> 22:34.400
What's wrong?

22:44.480 --> 22:46.480
Sacrifice.
