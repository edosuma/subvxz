00:28.180 --> 00:29.939
Jen, have a listen to this?

00:29.940 --> 00:31.839
Moss, have you
seen the newsletter?

00:31.840 --> 00:33.819
Does this sound mysterious?

00:38.700 --> 00:41.219
Yeah, yeah, it's quite mysterious.

00:41.220 --> 00:43.859
I was hoping for ruddy mysterious.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.019
It's fairly mysterious.

00:46.020 --> 00:50.019
Compiling a playlist for a
role-playing game I'm hosting.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.979
Important to get the right atmos.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.979
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:53.980 --> 00:56.019
Kind of a Dungeons
and Dragons thing.

00:56.020 --> 00:57.979
Ew, is this something
to do with sex?

00:57.980 --> 00:59.499
Ha! Far from it, Jen.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.699
No, you see, in role-playing,
one person is a dungeon master,

01:02.700 --> 01:04.099
or game master, or keeper.

01:04.099 --> 01:05.539
He or she controls the world

01:05.540 --> 01:08.179
and tells the players
what they're experiencing,

01:08.180 --> 01:09.939
whether battling a coal monster,

01:09.940 --> 01:13.259
or kicking back in a smelly old
tavern with some roguish elves.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.419
Played over a few hours,

01:14.420 --> 01:17.459
it uses dice rolls to determine
the outcome of events.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.099
Unlike most board games
you might be familiar with,

01:20.100 --> 01:22.419
role-playing games often
use a 20-sided dice.

01:22.420 --> 01:23.299
- Moss?
- Yeah.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.339
I want to stop listening to this.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.859
I completely understand.

01:26.860 --> 01:30.659
So, in the world
we actually live in,

01:30.660 --> 01:34.579
a post has opened up
for Entertainments Manager.

01:34.580 --> 01:38.579
I could do that. That sounds great.
Better than whatever this job is.

01:38.740 --> 01:41.259
Entertainments Manager.

01:41.260 --> 01:43.859
It's not for you, Jen.

01:43.860 --> 01:45.939
What? Organising cultural events

01:45.940 --> 01:48.699
and visiting business partners,
that is so me.

01:48.700 --> 01:52.579
It's not though.
It'sreallynot for you.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.339
Oh, what am I talking to you for?
Where's Roy?

01:54.340 --> 01:55.459
Not in yet.

01:55.460 --> 01:57.979
Is he still moping about
after that girl?

01:57.980 --> 02:00.979
Worse than ever.
Thank God he can't play guitar.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.419
Have you seen the pictures?

02:02.420 --> 02:04.579
Pictures? There's more than one?

02:04.580 --> 02:05.939
Yeah, there's a buttload.

02:05.940 --> 02:08.899
And she's Photoshopped
out of all of them.

02:08.900 --> 02:12.899
Yeah, it's like someone
broke up with Stalin.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.939
It's such a shame.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.939
I've never seen him happier
than the last few months. And now...

02:25.380 --> 02:26.339
Oh, hi, Roy!

02:26.340 --> 02:27.899
Hi, Roy.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.019
It's okay, you're obviously
talking about me.

02:30.020 --> 02:30.859
No, no...

02:30.860 --> 02:32.539
It's fine.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.499
I realise I haven't been the
easiest person to be around

02:35.500 --> 02:36.579
the last few weeks.

02:36.580 --> 02:39.899
But I really feel like I've
turned the corner now. I really do.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.419
So if we can all just
carry on as normal...

02:42.420 --> 02:45.299
My God, oh, my God!

02:45.300 --> 02:47.659
I feel like I've come out
the other side of it now.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.819
So, everything's going to be OK
from here on in...

02:50.820 --> 02:52.739
My heart hurts!

02:52.740 --> 02:56.699
You do seem better than yesterday.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.639
But Roy, you've got
to snap out of this.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.479
I know, I know.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.859
Some things just don't work out.

03:02.860 --> 03:05.979
I know you're not used to being
in a long-term relationship.

03:05.980 --> 03:08.619
It's really rare for me.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.699
It'ssorare.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.219
But take it from me,
most of them just don't work out.

03:14.220 --> 03:16.259
She's right, Roy.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.019
And how would you know?

03:18.020 --> 03:19.979
I do all right.

03:19.980 --> 03:21.299
When?

03:21.300 --> 03:24.339
Well, if you must know,
I met a girl on holiday.

03:24.340 --> 03:26.859
They're always on holiday,
aren't they, Moss?

03:26.860 --> 03:30.579
Oh, shut up, Dumpo,
the elephant who got dumped!

03:30.580 --> 03:31.499
Hey, hey!

03:31.500 --> 03:32.299
Well...

03:32.300 --> 03:35.339
No, it's okay. I'm all right.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.819
I mean, I'm still a bit...

03:36.820 --> 03:39.099
She never said goodbye,
so I just kind of...

03:39.100 --> 03:43.099
It still just hurts just a little
bit whenever I think about her.

03:43.100 --> 03:47.099
So. I guess all I have to do is just
never think about her. Simples!

03:49.100 --> 03:53.099
Oh, she used to love that ad.

03:58.180 --> 04:00.779
It's not for you, Jen.

04:00.780 --> 04:02.619
What, why not?

04:02.620 --> 04:05.539
Entertainments Manager?
Do you know what that involves?

04:05.540 --> 04:08.219
From what I can gather
it's organising cultural events

04:08.220 --> 04:09.859
for out-of-town business partners.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.619
That's right. Yes, yes.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.459
It's not for you.

04:13.460 --> 04:16.899
It won't interfere with my duties
in the IT department.

04:16.899 --> 04:20.899
And I love culture. I've seen
We Will Rock You four times.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.739
Eurgh...

04:24.740 --> 04:26.379
Well, Jen, I'd love to help you,

04:26.380 --> 04:29.259
but traditionally the role
of Entertainments Manager

04:29.260 --> 04:30.779
has always been held by a man.

04:30.780 --> 04:33.659
Mr. Reynholm,
I don't need to remind you

04:33.660 --> 04:36.259
of the report
that denounced Reynholm Industries

04:36.260 --> 04:38.619
as an institutionally sexist
organisation.

04:38.620 --> 04:42.619
Now, you hold on a minute,
sugar tits!

04:43.740 --> 04:46.219
Everyone saw through that report.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.459
I even got that award
off those feminists.

04:48.460 --> 04:52.459
The one shaped like
the ice-cream fellow.

04:53.020 --> 04:57.019
That's a Shithead Of The Year award.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.579
It actually says it on the base,
"Shithead Of The Year."

05:02.580 --> 05:06.579
Did you not read the base?

05:25.820 --> 05:26.859
Oh, God!

05:26.860 --> 05:30.659
Women, eh?

05:30.660 --> 05:32.539
What are they? Who knows?

05:32.540 --> 05:33.699
Don't do this.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.699
Can't live with them,
can't find them...sometimes.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.299
What's going on
in their little heads?

05:41.300 --> 05:45.299
Don't ask me, I'm not a flippin'
women psychiatrist.

05:46.140 --> 05:50.639
But I have learned one or two things
from conversations with my mother.

05:50.940 --> 05:53.339
No, no, Moss, please,

05:53.340 --> 05:55.979
don't go any further,
just stop right there.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.739
You're no good at this kind of thing,
Moss, you'll just make it worse.

05:59.740 --> 06:02.299
Sorry, it's just
I've never seen you like this.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.939
I know. But I'll be fine.

06:03.940 --> 06:06.459
I will. It's just...
You can't help with this.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.619
You just can't.

06:07.620 --> 06:10.059
I've got it. I've got the job.

06:10.060 --> 06:10.779
What?

06:10.780 --> 06:14.339
Douglas gave me the job
so I'd stop talking.

06:14.340 --> 06:18.339
Jen's Entertainments Manager.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.179
It's not for you, Jen.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.899
Why does everyone keep saying that?

06:24.900 --> 06:25.819
What happened to Gerry?

06:25.820 --> 06:27.099
Massive heart attack.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.379
I'm not surprised.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.619
Why are you not surprised?
Why is it not for me?

06:30.620 --> 06:34.419
Gerry was the... He was the
company Fredo. You're the new Fredo.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.859
I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.739
Fredo, from the Godfather.

06:37.740 --> 06:39.419
Who's Fredo again? Who's he in it?

06:39.420 --> 06:43.259
He's the brother, whose job it is to
take out-of-town businessmen and...

06:43.260 --> 06:46.299
Show them a good time, yeah,
that's what I have to do.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.019
I was thinking West End show...

06:48.020 --> 06:50.299
No, no, Jen, I don't
think you understand.

06:50.300 --> 06:54.299
These men are going to expect
a lot more than a West End show.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.259
Fredo, Jen, he was,

06:58.260 --> 06:59.979
he was sort of a pimp.

06:59.980 --> 07:00.979
Oh, shut up.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.139
Wasn't he, Moss?

07:02.140 --> 07:03.299
What?

07:03.300 --> 07:05.699
Fredo, in the film,
he was essentially a pimp.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.699
No, he took the ring to Mordor.

07:14.740 --> 07:17.339
Fredowasa pimp.

07:17.340 --> 07:20.019
No, no, that film was the '70s.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.739
Things are different now.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.979
Businessmen are different.

07:27.660 --> 07:31.659
Anyway, enough about our balls.

07:32.260 --> 07:36.259
Gentleman, I'd like you to meet Jen.

07:41.340 --> 07:44.659
No, no, no, Jen's
our new Entertainments Manager.

07:44.660 --> 07:47.219
But she's a woman, isn't she?

07:47.220 --> 07:51.219
Jen, I'd like you to meet
an old friend of mine, Phil.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.139
What are you up to, Reynholm?

07:56.140 --> 07:57.419
Don't you worry, Phil.

07:57.420 --> 08:00.459
Jen may look like an old maid
holding pennies in her arse,

08:00.460 --> 08:02.819
but she knows the sleaziest routes

08:02.820 --> 08:05.539
round this old town
I like to call Londinius.

08:05.540 --> 08:09.539
And I'm sure she's planned something
suitably raucous for you reprobates.

08:10.220 --> 08:14.219
Oh, yes, yes, I have tickets for
a wonderful show in the West End.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.259
As long as it
doesn't have subtitles.

08:16.260 --> 08:17.179
Subtitles, no.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.099
Woah, what's got subtitles?!

08:19.100 --> 08:20.379
This thing she's bringing us to.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.539
Subtitles? Oh, God!

08:21.540 --> 08:24.499
I can't read while I'm also
trying to see things.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.419
No, no, it's a show, it's a show.
There's no subtitles.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.059
I hate subtitles.

08:30.060 --> 08:31.339
What happened to Gerry?

08:31.340 --> 08:32.739
His heart exploded.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.379
Brilliant!

08:35.380 --> 08:36.899
No, he's quite seriously ill.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.339
That's classic Gerry.

08:40.900 --> 08:44.459
Gerry wouldn't have brought us
to something with subtitles.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.579
There's no subtitles, it's a show.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.379
Come on, Jen, what type of show?

08:49.380 --> 08:53.019
Well, yes, well it's very raunchy.

08:53.020 --> 08:55.299
Yes, I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.179
Women in it?

08:56.180 --> 08:58.499
Women in it?
Yes, it's an all-woman show.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.899
It's very rude.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.379
An all-woman show?

09:01.380 --> 09:02.499
And it's rude.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.499
Eiffel Tower!

09:09.660 --> 09:12.259
I'm so sorry, I really
can't apologise enough.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.499
I've never been so
embarrassed in my life.

09:14.500 --> 09:18.499
That woman was in EastEnders,
how dare you humiliate her?!

09:20.100 --> 09:23.619
It's not our fault you took us
to The Vagina Monologues.

09:23.620 --> 09:26.179
You get there,
and it's justwomentalking.

09:26.180 --> 09:27.779
False advertising.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.819
Look, we're in town
for five more days,

09:29.820 --> 09:32.219
you better have
something proper for us to do.

09:32.220 --> 09:35.379
Next time you take us to something
about talking fannies,

09:35.380 --> 09:39.379
it better be about talking fannies.

09:44.180 --> 09:46.899
I know you had good reasons
for giving me this award.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.899
I should never have done
that interview.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.699
But that journalist had an agenda.

09:50.700 --> 09:53.339
There's more.
"Women are a kind of savage animal,

09:53.340 --> 09:56.819
"who men have civilised
with their insatiable sexuality."

09:56.820 --> 10:00.819
What don't you like about that?

10:01.220 --> 10:05.219
"Women are essentially no different
from radiators."

10:06.180 --> 10:09.539
"I like my women
like I like my toast, hot..."

10:09.540 --> 10:13.539
And consumable with butter.

10:13.540 --> 10:15.139
You don't have to remind me.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.779
I'm all too familiar
with my misguided words.

10:17.780 --> 10:21.779
Ladies, listen,
no-one can mistake me for Gok Wan.

10:22.980 --> 10:26.979
I've an old-fashioned mindset,
but damn it, at least I try.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.299
And Reynholm Industries is changing,
ladies, for the better.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.259
The glass ceiling
is now a glass floor.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.299
The women are floating above it,

10:35.300 --> 10:39.299
and the men are just looking up
at them.

10:39.980 --> 10:43.979
So, what do you want from us?

10:46.260 --> 10:50.139
Oh, please take that award back
and give it to somebody else.

10:50.140 --> 10:53.219
Mr. Reynholm, I really need
to talk to you about something.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.979
Ah, Jen, I'd like you to meet
some very special woman.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.699
Oh, no, no, no!

10:58.700 --> 11:00.019
What?

11:00.020 --> 11:02.579
Mr. Reynholm, I will not
work with prostitutes.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.059
No, no, no, these are feminists.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.779
Dress it up however youlike,

11:07.780 --> 11:09.699
they still sleep with men for money.

11:11.620 --> 11:15.099
but I don't charge
for these potatoes.

11:15.100 --> 11:19.019
And I don't like women who do.

11:19.020 --> 11:23.019
Don't listen to her!
The bitch is crazy.

11:27.740 --> 11:30.179
Douglas wants me
to see out the week.

11:30.180 --> 11:34.139
A whole week in the
company of those idiots.

11:34.140 --> 11:36.339
Culture's out, restaurants are out.

11:36.340 --> 11:40.339
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.699
Men, eh,

11:46.700 --> 11:50.699
what are they like? With their
bawdy talk and rough-housing,

11:50.940 --> 11:54.939
and their wandering hands,
and breath in the morning.

11:56.420 --> 11:58.379
I'd like to see them
have the babies.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.779
What are you getting at, Moss?

12:00.780 --> 12:02.819
Well, unless I'm very much mistaken,

12:02.820 --> 12:06.819
this seems to be a problem for
which you need the male perspective.

12:14.380 --> 12:17.299
Do you know any men?

12:17.300 --> 12:20.299
You want a good time, right?
One that walks on the wild side

12:20.300 --> 12:22.459
without compromising
your principles?

12:22.460 --> 12:24.419
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.779
Then you got it, baby!

12:26.780 --> 12:30.779
...which is why the game needs
a 20-sided dice.

12:43.740 --> 12:46.379
I've not understood a
word you've just said.

12:46.380 --> 12:49.019
What is it?
Some sort of computer game?

12:49.020 --> 12:53.019
In a sense, except it uses the
most powerful processor known to man.

12:53.100 --> 12:56.419
The human mind.

12:56.420 --> 12:57.739
But you're not playing.

12:57.740 --> 13:00.579
I'm not a player.
But I am playing.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.819
He sort of
tells us what's happening.

13:05.820 --> 13:07.539
I will be your guide.

13:07.540 --> 13:11.019
Through my words, you will
experience the land of Elfenheart.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.619
From the mighty mountains that
border the Goblin Wastelands.

13:14.620 --> 13:18.619
To the sewers that run like a spider
web through the city of Jandor.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.379
I, gentlemen, will be your eyes.

13:29.740 --> 13:33.739
I will be everyone you meet,
every creature you encounter,

13:34.260 --> 13:37.339
every trap you spring.

13:37.340 --> 13:41.339
What about him? What's this business
with the face like a slapped arse?

13:42.500 --> 13:46.419
I'm sorry, I just came out of
a long term relationship, so...

13:46.420 --> 13:49.339
It doesn't...
She was the greatest woman

13:49.340 --> 13:51.659
I've ever met and I'm never
going to see her again.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.459
But it's fine, I mean,
she never said goodbye.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.219
I'm not going
to bore you with it.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.379
See that you bloody don't!

13:58.380 --> 14:00.619
I still don't understand
what this game is!

14:00.620 --> 14:02.339
It seems gay.

14:02.340 --> 14:05.539
Are dragons gay, Phil?

14:05.540 --> 14:07.339
Mighty warrior priests wielding

14:07.340 --> 14:11.339
golden staffs.
I suppose they're gay too?

14:11.740 --> 14:13.419
Here are your character sheets.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.979
John One, you're a unicorn man.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.979
John Two, you're a wood fairy.

14:20.180 --> 14:24.179
And Phil, you're the Gypsy
assassin, Esmerelda.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.459
I'm a woman?

14:30.780 --> 14:32.299
I don't think I want to be a woman.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.459
Just go with it.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.419
It will end.

14:35.420 --> 14:39.299
So, gentlemen, are you prepared
to open the doors to your mind

14:39.300 --> 14:42.019
and travel to worlds
hitherto undreamed of?

14:49.300 --> 14:53.299
Look at those fun bags.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.379
Everybody doing okay, yeah?

14:55.380 --> 14:57.699
You good for drinks?

14:57.700 --> 15:00.299
Loosen up.
It's a role-playing party.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.899
Jen, can I have a word?

15:02.900 --> 15:06.179
I don't think I want
to hang with these guys.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.139
Oh, come on, Phil!

15:08.140 --> 15:10.659
These guys are the best.

15:10.660 --> 15:14.379
They're going to do things
tonight that'll blow your mind.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.139
Really?

15:15.140 --> 15:17.539
Really? Look at them.
They're young, they're keen.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.899
And all they want to do
is show you a good time.

15:19.900 --> 15:23.859
So get back there before
you hurt their feelings.

15:23.860 --> 15:27.859
Could I steal the lovely Roy
for a sec?

15:32.980 --> 15:36.179
It's just him in all of these.

15:36.180 --> 15:39.179
Oh, thanks, Jen, that was
all getting a little bit...

15:39.180 --> 15:41.299
What do you think you're doing?

15:41.300 --> 15:42.059
What?

15:42.060 --> 15:44.539
What? Bringing everyone
down with your private life.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.219
They don't want to know about
your miserable private life.

15:47.220 --> 15:49.699
They're here for a good time.
Look at that face.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.019
Who'd want to
role-play with that face?

15:53.020 --> 15:56.419
I'm sorry Jen... I just...
I'm not feeling it tonight.

15:56.420 --> 15:59.899
Then fake it, sweetheart, yeah?

15:59.900 --> 16:03.899
We're getting good money for this.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.659
Don't you want to get
the deposit for a flat,

16:07.660 --> 16:09.699
leave those bad memories behind?

16:09.700 --> 16:10.539
Yeah.

16:11.820 --> 16:13.699
I'll try harder, Jen.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.459
Okay.

16:15.460 --> 16:18.059
Good girl.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.059
Get back there and show
those Johns a good time.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.899
Well, that cleaned the pipes.

16:27.900 --> 16:31.499
I've got to thank you, Miranda,
for giving me a second chance.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.779
Oh, don't mention it. Although you
do know I don't have the authority

16:34.780 --> 16:36.659
to take back the award myself?

16:36.660 --> 16:39.579
Oh, what?

16:39.580 --> 16:43.579
No, we all make mistakes.
And you intrigue me.

16:43.860 --> 16:46.699
Something tells me there's
more to you than meets the eye.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.699
Do you mean the rumours
that I killed my wife?

16:53.700 --> 16:55.499
No. Are there rumours?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.539
No.

16:56.540 --> 17:00.539
There were rumours that there was a
rumour, but that was just bullshit.

17:01.700 --> 17:05.098
I didn't like the way the nominations
came from inside your company.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.979
Inside my company?

17:06.980 --> 17:09.459
Yeah, one of the women from the IT
department faxed a dossier

17:09.460 --> 17:11.378
of your behaviour over
the last 12 months.

17:11.380 --> 17:15.378
One of the women in
the IT department?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.299
Oh, sorry, Phil.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.858
Heal All is probably the worst spell
you could have used. The sound of

17:21.859 --> 17:24.659
your low-level magic attracts the
attention of the palace guards.

17:24.660 --> 17:26.819
Damn it!

17:26.819 --> 17:28.299
One comes through the door.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.459
Throwing knife.

17:29.460 --> 17:30.859
Are you sure? Quite a low damage.

17:30.860 --> 17:33.459
I have a plus 40%
chance of a critical.

17:33.460 --> 17:36.499
Remember the talking bunny that
gave me that magic bracelet?

17:36.500 --> 17:40.499
Yeah, that bunny thing
gave him that thing.

17:40.940 --> 17:44.739
You're absolutely right. Roll 'em.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.899
Yes!

17:47.900 --> 17:50.299
Direct hit.
The knife cleaves his head in twain

17:50.300 --> 17:53.739
and some of his brains runneth
down John Two's invisibility cloak.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.619
Eiffel Tower!

17:57.620 --> 17:59.979
Unfortunately, he wasn't alone.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.179
Dammit!

18:01.180 --> 18:04.899
'Tis the dreaded Imperial
Guard, the cruellest of all

18:04.900 --> 18:07.659
of Queen Elisa's troops.
At their head...

18:07.660 --> 18:11.659
someone you recognise.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.819
Well, well, well.

18:14.820 --> 18:18.339
If it isn't the adventurers who
have been causing me all this bother.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.139
Lucius Santana!

18:20.140 --> 18:22.539
The very same.

18:22.540 --> 18:25.779
Stand your men down, Lucius!
We have no quarrel with you!

18:25.780 --> 18:29.179
Quarrel? I just came to see how a
mismatched bunch of raggle taggle

18:29.180 --> 18:32.219
adventurers bested some of the
deadliest criminals in Crackenwood.

18:32.220 --> 18:34.219
That's us!

18:38.580 --> 18:40.939
You have my thanks.
And if you ever want to join

18:40.940 --> 18:43.499
the Palace Guard,
you know where I am.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.859
The Palace Guard?

18:46.860 --> 18:48.539
You have my sword.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.059
And my staff.

18:50.060 --> 18:52.379
And my bunny bracelet.

18:52.380 --> 18:56.379
And whatever it is that I have.

18:56.780 --> 18:58.299
The mist clears.

18:58.300 --> 19:02.299
You see a lone, female figure.

19:06.660 --> 19:10.659
That's ruddy mysterious.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.339
Hello, Darkharden.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.619
Hello.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.499
Who goes there?

19:20.500 --> 19:24.499
It is I, Queen Elisa Eldridge of
the Elves, who cruelly jilted you

19:24.940 --> 19:28.939
not three moons ago.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.499
Don't do this.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.499
Just go with it, Roy.

19:47.820 --> 19:51.419
Hello, my queen.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.299
How are you?

19:53.300 --> 19:56.259
I'm fine.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.299
You look well.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.699
So do you... Does she?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.139
Yes, she does, actually.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.699
Does she?

20:03.700 --> 20:06.619
So, what are you up to?

20:06.620 --> 20:08.659
Oh, you know just...

20:08.660 --> 20:11.579
Just keeping busy.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.819
Missing you a little bit.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.379
Yourself?

20:16.380 --> 20:19.019
Usual boring pageantry.

20:19.020 --> 20:23.019
You know how the people of
Pippsiehollow love a parade.

20:23.140 --> 20:26.019
What are you doing here?

20:27.540 --> 20:28.579
Sorry.

20:31.380 --> 20:35.379
Sorry. Bear with me.
Bear with me. Bear with me.

20:40.260 --> 20:44.259
I sense a sadness in you.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.619
It's just hard.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.979
You know?

20:55.980 --> 20:59.979
I miss you.

20:59.980 --> 21:03.979
I can still smell you on our pillow.

21:04.940 --> 21:07.619
When I close my eyes,

21:07.620 --> 21:11.619
it's still your face I see.

21:14.420 --> 21:16.939
It's just hard.

21:16.940 --> 21:20.939
You were here
and then you were gone.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.579
What do you want?

21:24.580 --> 21:28.579
It was not easy for me
to come here, Darkharden.

21:28.900 --> 21:32.899
But I had one thing
I felt I needed to say to you.

21:49.860 --> 21:51.359
Goodbye.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.699
Goodbye.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.659
Brilliant night! Brilliant!
I can't believe

22:13.660 --> 22:16.939
I've never tried role-playing
games before.

22:16.940 --> 22:20.939
I'm going to go home and tell
the whole rugby club about it.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.299
Roy and Moss did not disappoint?

22:23.300 --> 22:25.579
They did not.
I'd like to see them again.

22:25.580 --> 22:27.499
Thank you, Douglas.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.939
That's one special little
lady you've got there.

22:30.940 --> 22:34.939
I'm glad Jerry died.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.339
Eiffel Tower!

22:36.340 --> 22:39.099
Eiffel Tower! Eiffel Tower!

22:39.100 --> 22:41.819
Eiffel Tower!

22:41.820 --> 22:45.819
Before you go, Jen,
I know it was you.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.879
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!

22:54.580 --> 22:57.299
That's right.
That's right!

22:57.300 --> 22:58.379
Shut up!

22:58.380 --> 22:59.939
Oh, you've cheered up.

22:59.940 --> 23:02.899
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling a
lot better now, Jen, thanks.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.899
Thanks to a certain Elfin queen.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.819
What happened to Fredo, in the film?

23:11.820 --> 23:15.819
Ah, oh...
The Godfather has him killed.

23:18.220 --> 23:20.059
I'm going to go home.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.559
I'm not feeling too good.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.499
Problem solved!
