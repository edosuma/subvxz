03:34.499 --> 03:36.580
Yeah, no, it wasn't too bad.

03:36.664 --> 03:40.749
We didn't even hit any bad weather
until the Midwest.

03:41.332 --> 03:46.291
I'm excited, it was competitive,
but they got my design.

03:47.249 --> 03:50.748
We're incredibly lucky. We got a nice house.

04:07.498 --> 04:10.331
So, like it?

04:38.997 --> 04:41.415
I like our old house.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.830
Why is this furniture here?

04:51.666 --> 04:53.040
Previous owners left it behind.

04:53.665 --> 04:55.748
We're going to get rid of it
once our stuff arrives.

04:55.831 --> 04:58.205
It's only temporary.

04:58.956 --> 05:00.539
I always wanted to restore an old house.

05:02.374 --> 05:05.205
Come here, I want to show you something.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.706
These are the original plans.

05:15.247 --> 05:18.497
This thing was built in 1912.

05:19.039 --> 05:20.871
I thought that maybe
that would be your bedroom,

05:21.623 --> 05:25.371
second door on the right.

05:25.454 --> 05:27.496
Like, they added this wall here
to house the central air duct

05:27.789 --> 05:30.413
for a completely inefficient use of space.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.538
I thought we'd open it up and restore it
to its original layout, what do you think?

05:32.580 --> 05:36.039
You couldn't find a crappy
remodel closerto home?

05:37.622 --> 05:39.996
Come on.
A change of scenery is a good thing.

05:40.454 --> 05:42.748
Not always.

05:43.165 --> 05:44.497
Okay, don't judge the kitchen!

05:48.955 --> 05:50.747
I've got someone working
on the water damage.

05:55.246 --> 05:58.246
And then we're gonna gut this stuff.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.247
We're gonna get new countertops, cabinets,

06:00.329 --> 06:02.539
but I'm gonna wait for stuff
to settle down at work first.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.996
Which will be never.

06:05.371 --> 06:06.829
Speak of the devil.

06:11.622 --> 06:12.746
Yeah, hey, it's Jerry.

08:22.286 --> 08:25.203
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

08:25.413 --> 08:26.495
<i>I sure would.</i>

08:26.578 --> 08:28.201
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

08:28.243 --> 08:30.077
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

08:30.495 --> 08:32.827
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

08:32.910 --> 08:34.827
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

09:27.786 --> 09:28.786
Hey.

09:30.826 --> 09:33.036
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

09:36.119 --> 09:38.326
We just moved in across the street.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.285
I'm Rose.

09:42.661 --> 09:43.826
Leila.

09:43.910 --> 09:44.950
Hey, Leila.

09:47.743 --> 09:49.327
Are you all right?

09:50.617 --> 09:53.911
My dad is, like, unreal, I can't even tell you.

09:54.825 --> 09:58.826
Me and my dad, we argue all the time.

10:00.909 --> 10:03.825
I mean,
obviously I don't know your situation.

10:05.491 --> 10:07.451
But I'm sure it's gonna be okay.

10:07.493 --> 10:10.200
See, that's the thing, it's not gonna be okay.

10:12.241 --> 10:14.700
Yeah, he can't erase everything he did.

10:14.784 --> 10:15.909
She's gone

10:17.285 --> 10:18.993
and she's not coming back.

10:19.868 --> 10:20.909
Ever.

10:23.286 --> 10:24.742
What's your deal anyway?

10:24.825 --> 10:29.242
Nothing, like I said, we just moved here.

10:29.743 --> 10:32.617
Honestly, how can you live in that house?

10:45.533 --> 10:48.367
Honey, let's get in the house now, okay?

10:50.368 --> 10:51.450
Come on.

10:53.115 --> 10:54.283
Come on.

11:09.575 --> 11:12.533
She said she doesn't understand
how we could live here.

11:12.658 --> 11:14.533
- What do you mean?
- In this house.

11:14.616 --> 11:16.576
Why would she say that?

11:17.159 --> 11:18.740
Did something happen here?

11:19.783 --> 11:23.074
No, nothing happened here.

11:23.116 --> 11:27.658
This is a great house, give it time,
it'll be home before you know it.

11:33.574 --> 11:37.866
I had your prescription
transferred over to the local pharmacy,

11:37.908 --> 11:40.865
so let me know when it's time for a refill.

11:57.409 --> 11:59.615
I don't want to be on medication any more.

11:59.657 --> 12:02.240
Rose, we've been over this.

12:06.491 --> 12:08.740
So, I thought maybe this week
we could take a cruise,

12:08.782 --> 12:12.157
check out some local campuses,
University of Chicago, Northwestern...

12:12.241 --> 12:14.449
I'm going back to Stanford.

12:21.031 --> 12:24.864
Your mom loved this city,
she talked about it all the time.

12:25.656 --> 12:27.447
She loved the people, the music.

12:29.323 --> 12:30.697
She loved everything about the place.

12:30.781 --> 12:33.905
The lakefront, the
museums, she hated

12:34.030 --> 12:36.907
baseball but loved
Wrigley Field,

12:36.990 --> 12:39.574
Buckingham Fountain all lit up at night.

12:41.031 --> 12:42.406
It's beautiful.

12:42.489 --> 12:45.240
Yeah, I remember the pictures.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.949
Tomorrow why don't we check it out?

12:47.740 --> 12:48.823
Would you like that?

12:55.490 --> 12:58.822
Damn, looks like
I have to go into work tomorrow.

15:24.529 --> 15:25.820
Shocker.

16:24.030 --> 16:25.070
Don't come near me!

16:25.154 --> 16:27.403
Christ, whoa. Time out, Jesus.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.362
Who the hell are you
and what are you doing in my house?

16:29.445 --> 16:32.319
I'm Noah, Noah Henry,
I'm part of the construction crew.

16:32.361 --> 16:35.361
We were hired to work on your house,
that's why I have keys.

16:35.403 --> 16:37.570
We left a bunch of tools downstairs,
somebody must've moved them.

16:37.945 --> 16:40.736
There was a scraping sound.
What was that, was it you?

16:40.861 --> 16:42.778
That was the guys outside
pulling off the gutters.

16:43.153 --> 16:44.713
Sounded like the walls were caving in.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.402
Well they wrap around the entire house

16:46.485 --> 16:50.029
and they're filled with ice and snow,
dead leaves, all kinds of gnarly stuff.

16:50.112 --> 16:52.153
That's why you're getting
this water damage inside.

16:57.569 --> 16:59.070
Why is it so quiet now?

16:59.443 --> 17:01.609
Maybe they got the first side down already?

17:09.483 --> 17:12.734
God, I'm so sorry. Let me get you some ice.

17:16.029 --> 17:17.693
My dad didn't tell me you were coming today.

17:17.818 --> 17:22.486
Yeah. No, the contractors weren't ready
for us on anotherjob so we swung by here.

17:22.569 --> 17:24.778
We didn't think anybody was home.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.403
Here.

17:28.028 --> 17:29.361
Thanks.

17:31.070 --> 17:32.236
Does it hurt?

17:32.736 --> 17:34.319
Only when I breathe.

17:34.403 --> 17:38.611
I'm kidding. Kind of, sort of. Not really.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.069
So, are you going to be here all day?

17:45.986 --> 17:48.944
I wish.
Got a few more houses we need to hit up.

17:51.861 --> 17:54.235
- Well, I should probably...
- Absolutely.

17:54.693 --> 17:56.861
Only, I didn't catch your name?

17:57.403 --> 17:58.818
It's Rose.

18:00.110 --> 18:03.318
All right, well, don't forget to lock up
before you leave.

18:03.903 --> 18:05.694
All right, Rosy Rose.

18:06.610 --> 18:07.735
Just Rose.

18:10.861 --> 18:13.194
Sorry again for the intrusion.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.235
What the hell?

20:19.440 --> 20:20.817
- Hello?
- Hey.

20:21.525 --> 20:22.650
<i>How's it going?</i>

20:22.734 --> 20:26.233
<i>I just have a few things to finish up
and then I'll be heading home.</i>

20:26.316 --> 20:27.609
When?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.607
I'm just asking 'cause I'm making dinner.

20:29.691 --> 20:32.691
<i>That sounds good. I'm not sure.</i>

20:32.775 --> 20:35.108
<i>Not long, I'll call you from the car.</i>

20:36.941 --> 20:38.607
Okay, hurry home.

22:20.064 --> 22:22.899
Your mom burnt plenty of dinners
when she first started cooking.

22:22.982 --> 22:25.106
I turned it off, I told you.

22:25.231 --> 22:28.149
Maybe you turned it up by accident instead.

22:28.814 --> 22:31.607
Yeah, or maybe
if you didn't stay at work all night

22:31.690 --> 22:33.397
we could actually eat when dinner's ready.

22:33.979 --> 22:36.397
I'm sorry, I'll call next time. I promise.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.357
Do what you want,
I'm not even supposed to be here.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.689
I should be away at school.

22:40.731 --> 22:46.524
Rose, the administration suggested strongly
that you take a leave of absence.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.273
Hey.

23:28.273 --> 23:29.606
What are you doing here?

23:33.438 --> 23:35.064
Is Leila home?

23:38.814 --> 23:43.021
You two seem about the same age,
I hope that's where the similarities stop.

23:43.104 --> 23:45.438
You seem like a very smart girl.

23:46.189 --> 23:47.438
I should be going home.

23:50.855 --> 23:52.980
Stay out of trouble, you hear?

23:57.521 --> 23:59.312
Rose, have you seen
those blueprints for the house?

23:59.354 --> 24:00.855
The ones I showed you?

24:01.147 --> 24:02.479
- What?
-For the house?

24:02.937 --> 24:04.104
No, I haven't seen 'em.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.813
That is so weird,
things don't just go missing.

24:06.896 --> 24:09.353
Will you keep an eye out?
I have to submit 'em to the city.

24:10.270 --> 24:11.271
What's that?

24:12.937 --> 24:15.647
I found it in the neighbours' driveway
across the street.

24:17.522 --> 24:18.855
What were you doing in their driveway?

24:18.938 --> 24:20.897
I haven't seen his daughter
since he caught us talking.

24:22.354 --> 24:25.563
What if... I don't know,
what if something happened to her?

24:28.187 --> 24:29.438
Just forget it.

24:30.270 --> 24:31.395
Is the modem hooked up?

24:31.479 --> 24:34.186
No, it's not working, but I'll call tomorrow.

24:47.479 --> 24:48.771
Help me.

27:42.393 --> 27:45.644
Let me out!

27:52.768 --> 27:53.850
Please help me,

27:53.975 --> 27:55.434
let me out!

27:55.975 --> 27:57.851
Help me!

28:33.309 --> 28:37.393
...the building, it's elegant, it's simple,
it's really sound.

28:37.476 --> 28:42.099
Just a simple beam construction.
What you don't see are the caissons.

28:42.183 --> 28:44.642
Go down 180 feet into the ground so...

28:48.015 --> 28:50.016
Will you excuse me for a second?

28:50.099 --> 28:53.726
Would you mind waiting in my office
forjust a minute? Thank you.

28:55.433 --> 28:56.558
Hey.

28:58.142 --> 29:00.058
Rose, what are you doing here?

29:00.518 --> 29:02.933
- Something's happening in the house.
- What are you talking about?

29:02.975 --> 29:06.433
Something. I don't know,
strange things keep happening.

29:07.226 --> 29:08.682
How did you get all the way down here?

29:08.765 --> 29:10.558
I flagged a cab in the street.

29:11.392 --> 29:13.433
All the way here? How did you pay?

29:13.517 --> 29:17.016
I didn't, you took my credit card,
I don't have anything.

29:17.392 --> 29:18.891
He's waiting downstairs.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.808
Oh, my God, look at you.
You must be freezing.

29:20.850 --> 29:23.349
What are you thinking? This isn't California.
Where's yourjacket?

29:24.391 --> 29:27.142
All right look, when this meeting is done
I'll take the rest of the day off.

29:27.183 --> 29:30.806
Here, give this to the cab driver.

29:30.890 --> 29:34.558
Actually, on second thought,
just stay here, don't move,

29:34.641 --> 29:37.350
I'll be right back. I'll take care of it, okay?

29:57.681 --> 30:00.642
<i>The last person to see Rachel
was Howard Markby,</i>

30:00.724 --> 30:02.516
<i>a neighbour of Mrs Garrison.</i>

30:18.848 --> 30:20.390
<i>Howard Markby, formerly a prime suspect</i>

30:20.431 --> 30:23.056
<i>in the disappearance
of 20-year-old Rachel Winacott,</i>

30:23.141 --> 30:25.224
<i>has been vindicated by police.</i>

30:25.474 --> 30:27.432
Winacott was a
houseguest staying

30:27.516 --> 30:30.348
with Cheri Garrison
of 340 Laura...

30:38.222 --> 30:39.640
It was right here.

30:42.015 --> 30:43.617
I found a doll head in my room.

30:45.430 --> 30:47.805
Rachel wanted me to go up there.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.141
That's why she knocked over
Mom's recipe box.

30:50.224 --> 30:53.055
She wanted me to go upstairs
and see what Howard Markby was doing.

30:53.555 --> 30:55.680
And then today
I found my phone in the drawer

30:55.764 --> 30:57.141
'cause she wanted me to find the doll head.

31:03.973 --> 31:05.014
Look.

31:07.432 --> 31:10.849
I don't understand,
it was easier to read before.

31:11.848 --> 31:15.141
But, here's the R and the A.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.267
Here's the W.

31:18.348 --> 31:19.555
Do you see it?

31:19.681 --> 31:21.224
"Rachel was here."

31:21.931 --> 31:23.766
To be honest, I don't.

31:24.599 --> 31:28.140
But even if I could,
didn't a girl named Rachel live here?

31:28.265 --> 31:32.140
- Wouldn't it make sense if she...
- Something bad happened to her.

31:32.431 --> 31:35.597
What about the door slamming shut?
I couldn't get out.

31:36.515 --> 31:37.931
It's an old house.

31:41.390 --> 31:42.847
It has quirks.

31:44.140 --> 31:45.721
Why couldn't I get out then?

31:45.804 --> 31:49.140
It was like someone was
pushing on it from the other side.

31:51.389 --> 31:52.888
It's stuck a little.

31:55.222 --> 31:58.930
It happens with wood, expands, contracts.

32:02.472 --> 32:03.931
Don't look at me like that.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.889
The necklace.

32:07.972 --> 32:10.473
Howard Markby
was the main suspect for a reason.

32:10.598 --> 32:12.804
Yeah, the police ended the investigation,

32:12.888 --> 32:15.722
but why was he a suspect in the first place?

32:16.764 --> 32:18.204
Did you call about the Internet?

32:18.264 --> 32:20.639
Yes, they sent someone by earlier today.
It should be working.

32:48.139 --> 32:49.803
Is that what you were
looking for downstairs?

32:53.014 --> 32:54.139
There.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.639
There, now do you see?

32:57.348 --> 32:59.889
How did this get back up here?
Explain that to me!

33:00.014 --> 33:01.015
Rose.

33:01.096 --> 33:02.803
No, I can't stay in this house.

33:02.845 --> 33:04.014
I want to stay at a hotel.

33:04.180 --> 33:07.013
- That's not gonna happen.
- I feel like I'm a prisoner here!

33:07.054 --> 33:08.137
I don't know anyone,

33:08.220 --> 33:11.804
I'm 20 years old and I can't even access
my own bank account without your consent!

33:11.846 --> 33:14.513
- I'm just doing what's best for you!
- No, you're doing what's best for you.

33:14.595 --> 33:15.802
I'm doing what's best for us!

33:15.844 --> 33:17.721
This is not my imagination!

33:17.804 --> 33:21.637
I'm not some crazy person,
it's not my emotions running wild!

33:21.845 --> 33:24.720
- I'm not Mom!
- That is enough! That's enough!

33:40.554 --> 33:42.845
I want you to be honest with me.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.678
Are you taking your meds?

33:49.053 --> 33:50.220
Yes.

33:52.845 --> 33:54.638
I think we should call Dr Turner,

33:54.720 --> 33:56.718
get a referral for someone local,
someone good.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.553
I don't need a psychiatrist!

34:05.137 --> 34:07.762
I just... I'm tired.

34:07.846 --> 34:11.012
I haven't been sleeping well.
Plus the stress of moving.

34:12.511 --> 34:16.386
You were right, I overreacted to everything.

34:18.096 --> 34:19.762
But I'm fine now.

34:20.554 --> 34:21.677
Really.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.678
I swear.

34:45.262 --> 34:47.427
Hey, where are you off to?

34:47.511 --> 34:48.761
Coffee shop.

34:49.094 --> 34:52.717
On foot? It's like three miles to town.
You don't have a car?

34:54.469 --> 34:55.592
Or a winter coat?

34:57.094 --> 35:00.386
Yeah, I'm still getting used to
this whole winter thing.

35:00.469 --> 35:01.929
I should probably run back inside.

35:02.636 --> 35:06.136
You mind if I wash my hands?
We were using this nasty epoxy stuff.

35:06.219 --> 35:07.803
Yeah, come on.

35:08.803 --> 35:09.844
So, how's the eye?

35:09.927 --> 35:11.969
I'm hanging in there, thanks.

35:12.759 --> 35:14.136
Stanford, huh?

35:14.219 --> 35:15.887
Oh, yeah, I'm just...

35:15.970 --> 35:18.718
I'm taking a semester off to figure things out.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.718
How 'bout you?

35:20.886 --> 35:24.301
Me? I'm working my way through school,
taking art classes in the city.

35:24.593 --> 35:25.760
That's cool.

35:26.676 --> 35:28.968
So, how's your boyfriend
coping with your absence?

35:29.176 --> 35:30.426
No boyfriend.

35:31.844 --> 35:33.802
Do you know Leila across the street?

35:33.844 --> 35:35.719
Leila? Yeah, kind of.

35:35.803 --> 35:39.468
We went to high school together,
she's a few years younger.

35:40.845 --> 35:43.677
Her dad was accused of kidnapping
that girl who used to live here.

35:44.302 --> 35:46.551
Yeah, it was big news for a minute

35:46.634 --> 35:49.095
until the truth came out
about her moving away.

35:51.012 --> 35:53.136
How do they know
that's what actually happened?

35:53.261 --> 35:57.178
I guess there was an email saying she left,
not exactly sure.

35:57.594 --> 36:01.053
Here's something I do know, you and me,
we should hang out.

36:02.676 --> 36:03.970
Isn't that what we're doing?

36:04.012 --> 36:05.926
No, I mean, like when I'm off the clock.

36:06.010 --> 36:07.636
You should see me
out of these work clothes,

36:07.677 --> 36:09.095
I'm a completely different person.

36:09.511 --> 36:10.761
I bet.

36:12.176 --> 36:14.970
Do you know why she was living here?
Rachel Winacott?

36:15.385 --> 36:17.511
I guess Cheri Garrison
was trying to help her out,

36:17.552 --> 36:19.260
she's always taking people in

36:19.343 --> 36:21.801
and organising charity events,
that sort of thing.

36:21.926 --> 36:24.427
She's like the saintly figure in our town.

36:24.511 --> 36:25.511
She still lives here?

36:25.718 --> 36:27.718
No, I heard she moved away.

36:28.968 --> 36:30.385
Wonder why.

36:35.052 --> 36:36.968
I'm gonna go grab a warmerjacket.

36:37.051 --> 36:38.510
Great idea.

36:39.218 --> 36:42.343
Think about what I said,
you and me hanging out.

36:51.261 --> 36:52.508
Noah?

37:14.092 --> 37:15.592
Noah?

37:38.509 --> 37:40.133
Is that you?

37:52.591 --> 37:54.048
- Dad!
- Rose!

37:54.132 --> 37:55.675
- Dad!
- What's the matter?

37:55.759 --> 37:56.842
I saw someone in the basement.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.464
There's someone down there.

38:00.547 --> 38:01.966
They're in the closet, I swear!

38:05.466 --> 38:06.716
In the closet.

38:07.507 --> 38:10.008
<i>He's 'm the comer 'gust standing there.</i>

38:19.425 --> 38:20.633
I know what I saw.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.508
I'm not making it up.

38:28.383 --> 38:30.465
Look, I thought the change of environment
might be a good thing,

38:30.507 --> 38:32.423
but obviously the move
has triggered something.

38:32.507 --> 38:34.008
This isn't about Mom!

38:34.674 --> 38:36.591
Howard Markby is hiding something,

38:36.674 --> 38:39.383
he sent his daughter away the day after
he caught us talking. Why is that?

38:39.466 --> 38:41.132
Rose, he did not send her away.

38:41.215 --> 38:42.923
You're right, God only knows
what he did to her.

38:43.007 --> 38:45.299
I just saw them together outside!

38:47.841 --> 38:50.840
No. Where are you...
Rose, do not go out there!

39:00.091 --> 39:02.841
Leila! Leila, we need to talk!

39:05.633 --> 39:07.883
Rachel Winacott didn't move away.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.633
He did something to her, didn't he?

39:11.759 --> 39:13.339
Why was he a suspect?

39:13.715 --> 39:15.339
What did he do to her?

39:16.923 --> 39:19.841
He didn't do anything.

39:19.882 --> 39:23.672
Rachel spent some time at our house,
so my dad was brought in for questioning.

39:23.714 --> 39:27.132
A few days later Cheri got an email
from her son saying they ran off together.

39:27.382 --> 39:30.589
No. That day you were out here crying,

39:31.422 --> 39:34.882
you said that he caused a lot of pain,
that she was never coming back.

39:34.923 --> 39:37.047
I was talking about my mom.

39:37.339 --> 39:40.006
They separated and now she wants a divorce.

39:41.841 --> 39:44.381
That's it, case closed, mystery solved.

39:45.257 --> 39:48.091
- I'm so sorry, she's not well.
- No.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.090
Where did you get that?

39:52.465 --> 39:54.422
This necklace belonged to Rachel.

39:54.464 --> 39:57.797
Yeah, she gave it to me for my birthday.

39:57.881 --> 39:59.964
My dad and I got in a fight
because he thought it was from Kyle.

40:00.047 --> 40:02.508
I got mad and I threw the necklace at him.

40:03.506 --> 40:04.922
You saw it happen?

40:06.214 --> 40:09.215
What, were you spying on us
from your window?

40:10.089 --> 40:12.256
I saw you that night in the driveway,

40:12.339 --> 40:14.757
with the garbage bag and the shovel.

40:15.923 --> 40:17.881
Yeah. So?

40:20.088 --> 40:21.339
So?

40:23.421 --> 40:25.465
I had a bag of gravel in the basement,

40:25.881 --> 40:30.421
I brought it up and put it in my truck
with a shovel to gain some traction.

40:30.506 --> 40:32.965
So don't come over here acting like
you know something about it,

40:33.007 --> 40:34.716
'cause you don't.

40:35.298 --> 40:36.422
I'm sorry.

40:36.507 --> 40:39.339
- We're terribly sorry, we're sorry.
- Sorry.

40:39.422 --> 40:40.797
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

40:40.922 --> 40:44.840
See? lt'sjust in your mind.
It's like what the doctors say.

40:44.922 --> 40:48.798
You find these things and you run with it.
They seem real, but...

41:02.714 --> 41:06.921
Rose, the workers are here,
but they're in the basement,

41:07.005 --> 41:09.297
I told 'em to keep it down.

41:11.546 --> 41:14.797
I know this last year has been
really hard on you.

41:16.922 --> 41:19.338
You have to try to move forward.

41:23.172 --> 41:26.006
I won't be gone long.
Call if you need me, okay?

41:35.714 --> 41:36.797
<i>I sure would.</i>

41:36.881 --> 41:38.379
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

41:38.463 --> 41:40.380
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

41:40.464 --> 41:42.089
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

41:42.838 --> 41:44.546
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

41:46.505 --> 41:48.630
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

41:48.921 --> 41:50.171
<i>I sure would.</i>

41:50.213 --> 41:52.212
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

41:52.254 --> 41:54.045
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

41:54.128 --> 41:56.171
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

41:56.671 --> 41:58.920
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

42:38.921 --> 42:42.961
You saw everything,
I must've looked like a total crazy person.

42:43.420 --> 42:45.294
No, not at all.

42:46.255 --> 42:47.754
Maybe my dad was right,

42:47.837 --> 42:50.961
maybe the stress
from the move triggered something,

42:51.044 --> 42:54.337
caused me to imagine things
that weren't really happening.

42:54.420 --> 42:56.380
Are your folks split up?

42:57.754 --> 42:59.880
Mine divorced a few years ago.

42:59.919 --> 43:02.712
I'm staying with my dad for now
until I get my own place.

43:05.255 --> 43:08.002
My parents aren't divorced.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.504
My mom died nine months ago.

43:11.336 --> 43:14.086
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

43:17.252 --> 43:20.129
You know, after she died I kind of fell apart.

43:21.044 --> 43:22.794
Well, yeah, of course.

43:23.461 --> 43:27.418
It was bad. It was really bad.

43:30.794 --> 43:34.878
My mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia
around the time I was born.

43:34.961 --> 43:39.045
You know, when she was feeling good,
she was the best mom in the world.

43:39.129 --> 43:40.960
She was so smart and funny.

43:42.044 --> 43:43.794
She was an amazing cook.

43:43.836 --> 43:46.504
But the medication, it changed her.

43:47.627 --> 43:49.877
It just completely wiped her out.

43:52.420 --> 43:57.085
I used to sit with her after school,
and I'd read to her, and we'd talk.

43:59.085 --> 44:02.753
I did most of the talking,
but she always listened.

44:05.419 --> 44:07.002
I mean, I get it.

44:07.085 --> 44:09.209
I can see why she didn't like taking her pills,

44:09.293 --> 44:13.127
they just make you feel so numb
and disconnected from everything.

44:16.001 --> 44:17.960
But to do what she did.

44:18.668 --> 44:24.042
And not leave a note or anything.

44:25.711 --> 44:28.169
That's something I'll never understand.

44:29.834 --> 44:32.669
I was so mad at my dad
when he said we were moving.

44:32.711 --> 44:36.168
I mean, all the memories
that we had in that house.

44:36.710 --> 44:39.419
That's all we had left.

44:45.336 --> 44:47.211
I'm never like this.

44:48.127 --> 44:49.753
Why is it so easy to talk to you?

44:51.293 --> 44:53.128
I've been told I'm a good listener.

44:59.127 --> 45:01.418
We have orange juice, apple juice.

45:01.543 --> 45:03.001
Water's fine.

45:08.753 --> 45:10.169
Glad I went with water.

45:11.834 --> 45:14.168
I know it's gross,
but I'm the only one who drinks it.

45:14.211 --> 45:17.752
I was kidding, kind of, sort of.

45:17.918 --> 45:19.086
Not really?

45:19.503 --> 45:21.792
So, I asked my dad about Cheri Garrison.

45:21.959 --> 45:23.835
Yeah, what did he say?

45:29.544 --> 45:30.544
Hey.

45:31.792 --> 45:33.835
I just wanted to apologise
for freaking you out.

45:33.960 --> 45:36.543
No, I'm sorry, it was totally me.

45:37.833 --> 45:40.752
Anyway, I was gonna say
we should be friends, but...

45:41.210 --> 45:43.501
I see you already found someone.

45:44.168 --> 45:46.210
We were just talking about Cheri Garrison.

45:48.709 --> 45:50.210
What do you want to know?

45:50.584 --> 45:53.751
The other day you said you didn't know
how we could live here.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.418
What'd you mean by that exactly?

45:55.668 --> 45:59.252
Hello, this place is beyond creepy.

45:59.293 --> 46:01.584
Cheri left without saying a word to anyone.

46:01.626 --> 46:03.667
No one even knew she was gone
for the longest time.

46:03.751 --> 46:08.792
All her stuff was here,
and she had just disappeared... Like that.

46:09.876 --> 46:15.292
And also, a few days before you moved in,
I heard yelling from in here.

46:15.376 --> 46:16.877
I called 911, the cops came,

46:16.960 --> 46:20.083
searched the entire house,
but there was nothing.

46:20.584 --> 46:22.585
Well, how do you know
it was coming from in here?

46:22.710 --> 46:26.708
Kyle heard it too, we were both
right outside on the stairs.

46:27.292 --> 46:29.542
It definitely came from in here.

46:30.875 --> 46:34.000
You got to wonder about somebody
who just skips out like that.

46:34.083 --> 46:36.292
What was Cheri Garrison running from?

46:36.459 --> 46:38.166
Yeah, or trying to hide.

46:38.501 --> 46:41.751
Before you guys moved in,
your dad had us do some quick fixes.

46:41.792 --> 46:46.667
In one of the bedrooms, the windows
were completely boarded up from the inside.

46:47.041 --> 46:49.167
Here, I'll show you.

46:49.667 --> 46:52.415
It was so effed up,
I had to take a picture of it.

46:53.501 --> 46:55.500
The glass wasn't broken or anything.

46:56.501 --> 46:59.583
Why go through the trouble
of boarding it up?

46:59.833 --> 47:01.125
Which room was that?

47:02.166 --> 47:03.542
The second door on the right.

47:04.667 --> 47:08.749
And, on the outside of the door,
was a heavy-duty padlock.

47:09.666 --> 47:12.165
Whatever was inside that room
wasn't supposed to get out.

47:17.874 --> 47:19.541
That doesn't prove anything.

47:20.166 --> 47:22.540
I came over here to see Rachel,

47:23.666 --> 47:27.624
she was so pale and anorexic looking.

47:28.500 --> 47:30.167
Cheri said she was
going through withdrawal,

47:30.209 --> 47:33.749
that's why she locked her up probably,
for her own good.

47:34.125 --> 47:37.375
It's what they do with addicts sometimes,
till the symptoms pass.

47:38.583 --> 47:42.874
Rachel was basically homeless,
Cheri gave her food and a place to stay.

47:43.874 --> 47:46.126
Cheri Garrison is a good person.

47:46.208 --> 47:50.665
I don't really know about her son, Marcus,
he was kind of quiet, shy.

47:50.999 --> 47:53.165
I gotta grab something from the van.

47:53.290 --> 47:54.749
Be right back.

47:59.749 --> 48:02.789
So, are you two a thing?

48:03.415 --> 48:05.915
What? No, we're just friends.

48:06.249 --> 48:10.165
Come on, you two are beyond smitten.
It's so painfully obvious.

48:12.458 --> 48:14.249
So, how old is Cheri's son?

48:14.499 --> 48:16.291
A few years older than us, I guess.

48:16.374 --> 48:20.290
He was home schooled, didn't get out of
the house much except for church.

48:20.374 --> 48:23.331
Total choir boy. Like, literally.

48:23.789 --> 48:25.748
That's why I was so surprised
when they ran off together.

48:25.789 --> 48:26.915
Rachel and Marcus?

48:27.000 --> 48:30.457
Yeah, what can I say? The girl has issues.

48:31.248 --> 48:35.955
Anyway, I should probably get going,
I'm staying with my grandparents tonight.

48:40.581 --> 48:42.663
I want to ask you something.

48:44.081 --> 48:45.872
You know the blueprints
for the house are missing.

48:45.913 --> 48:47.955
You think I took them.

48:48.288 --> 48:49.788
I'm just asking.

48:50.830 --> 48:53.749
You don't believe anything I say any more.

48:56.705 --> 48:58.040
I have a question.

48:58.914 --> 49:00.332
When you bought this house

49:00.415 --> 49:02.289
did you know that the windows
in my room were boarded up

49:02.373 --> 49:05.039
and that the door had a padlock on it?

49:07.290 --> 49:11.664
What else do you know about this house
that you're not telling me?

50:50.372 --> 50:52.497
<i>"The bitch finally let me out.</i>

50:52.747 --> 50:55.496
<i>"It's so dark and cold down there,
no food, no water.</i>

50:55.955 --> 50:58.787
<i>"I have to find a way to leave
but she's always watching.</i>

50:58.872 --> 51:01.454
<i>"My whole body aches, I feel so weak."</i>

51:17.248 --> 51:19.121
<i>"Cheri, Marcus and Rachel."</i>

51:56.037 --> 51:59.078
<i>"Marcus stood up for me today,
he clearly has feelings for me</i>

51:59.120 --> 52:01.535
<i>"but it's only making things worse
for both of us.</i>

52:01.828 --> 52:04.997
<i>"I wonder how long
she'll keep him locked up."</i>

53:11.327 --> 53:12.328
Help me!

53:16.951 --> 53:17.995
Help me!

54:00.578 --> 54:03.451
You're gonna have a really hard time
convincing people, that's all.

54:03.576 --> 54:05.535
Nobody's gonna believe
she did the things you're saying.

54:05.619 --> 54:08.326
Well, once they realise it was all a lie.

54:08.409 --> 54:11.952
It's like her charity was a way to cover up
what was actually happening in this house.

54:12.035 --> 54:15.201
That's why she disappeared overnight,
she didn't want to get caught.

54:18.368 --> 54:21.161
So, my friend Charlie's
having a hotel party tonight.

54:21.244 --> 54:25.452
There's a great indoor pool,
guaranteed good times, you should come.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.745
In fact, I insist.

54:27.786 --> 54:30.869
You need to get out of the house,
meet some new people.

54:30.952 --> 54:32.285
I'll pick you up at 8:00?

54:34.494 --> 54:35.702
Great.

54:35.785 --> 54:39.909
Only thing is I'm not supposed to
use the work van after hours,

54:39.951 --> 54:42.076
I don't want your dad to see me driving it.

54:42.159 --> 54:44.785
So is it cool if I pick you up
around the corner?

55:36.531 --> 55:39.117
Yeah, I'll see you in 20 minutes.

55:39.492 --> 55:40.992
I'm gonna bring a friend.

55:41.075 --> 55:43.159
She's cool, she just moved here.

56:21.033 --> 56:22.366
Rose?

56:25.658 --> 56:27.656
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

56:27.824 --> 56:29.032
<i>I sure would.</i>

56:29.157 --> 56:30.866
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

56:30.906 --> 56:32.907
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

56:32.949 --> 56:34.492
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

56:35.282 --> 56:36.866
<i>We'd probably kill each other.</i>

56:41.784 --> 56:43.491
<i>Would my princess care to lick the spoon?</i>

56:43.574 --> 56:45.074
<i>Rose'?
-l sure would.</i>

56:45.157 --> 56:46.824
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

56:46.907 --> 56:49.074
<i>All right, enough, you two.</i>

56:49.157 --> 56:51.574
<i>What would you guys do without me?</i>

57:14.949 --> 57:17.781
Hey, sorry I'm late. Did you get my text?

57:18.780 --> 57:20.405
No, I couldn't find my phone.

57:20.615 --> 57:23.156
No way.
You've been out here this whole time?

57:23.240 --> 57:25.905
I'm so sorry,
I got stuck at home helping my mom.

57:25.989 --> 57:28.031
She wouldn't let me leave.

57:28.115 --> 57:29.823
Didn't you say you lived with your dad?

57:29.948 --> 57:32.906
Oh, yeah. No, no.
I stopped by my mom's for dinner.

57:35.948 --> 57:38.199
You look pretty, by the way.

57:38.282 --> 57:39.406
Thanks.

57:54.657 --> 57:55.823
Thanks.

57:56.155 --> 57:57.531
Here you go.

57:59.490 --> 58:00.946
I'm glad you came tonight.

58:02.322 --> 58:04.824
So, I was wondering.

58:04.907 --> 58:07.738
You said you kind of
fell apart after your mom.

58:07.821 --> 58:09.280
What happened exactly?

58:09.614 --> 58:12.072
If you're comfortable telling me.

58:12.155 --> 58:13.947
Let down your wall, girl.

58:17.364 --> 58:21.573
Remember when I said I'm taking
some time off to figure things out?

58:21.656 --> 58:24.949
Well, I didn't really have a say in the matter.

58:24.991 --> 58:28.616
Truth is, after my mom died,
I wound up in the hospital.

58:29.449 --> 58:31.449
My dad probably thinks I'm exactly like her.

58:31.491 --> 58:34.489
My doctor even said the episode I had
was brought on by stress.

58:34.530 --> 58:37.656
Not mental illness or anything like that.

58:41.239 --> 58:43.322
Why do you want to know all this stuff?

58:43.822 --> 58:45.198
'Cause I like you.

58:49.447 --> 58:52.490
People, this is a party.

58:52.531 --> 58:55.322
If you're not adding value, you're out, huh?

58:55.365 --> 58:56.905
Yeah!

58:59.114 --> 59:00.490
Can we do this?

59:00.904 --> 59:02.240
Yeah, let's do it.

01:01:18.235 --> 01:01:19.611
Sorry, I haven't.

01:01:19.736 --> 01:01:22.738
Rose! Have you seen Leila?

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.069
Not since the other day.

01:01:25.152 --> 01:01:27.152
She said she was going
to her grandparents' house.

01:01:30.028 --> 01:01:31.527
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

01:01:32.028 --> 01:01:33.653
Hello?

01:01:34.652 --> 01:01:35.944
Is everything all right?

01:01:36.152 --> 01:01:39.944
I haven't heard from her since last night,
and she's not answering her phone, so...

01:01:41.861 --> 01:01:44.651
If you hear from her
would you let me know, please?

01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:46.319
Yeah.

01:01:47.195 --> 01:01:48.527
Thanks.

01:01:48.737 --> 01:01:50.195
Okay.

01:01:54.901 --> 01:01:56.361
This is very helpful.

01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:58.486
Yeah. Thank you, Dr Turner.

01:01:58.861 --> 01:02:00.526
Okay, I will.

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.194
Okay.

01:02:05.067 --> 01:02:06.902
Why were you talking to her?

01:02:06.986 --> 01:02:09.237
She was giving me your referral.

01:02:11.693 --> 01:02:14.736
Something's happening in this house
whether you choose to believe it or not.

01:02:14.819 --> 01:02:16.527
Rose, I can't do this right now.

01:02:16.652 --> 01:02:19.569
Do you see this?
I have a huge presentation, I have to focus.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.068
You never have time for anything but work.

01:02:21.152 --> 01:02:23.445
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is!

01:02:23.902 --> 01:02:26.526
When Mom got really sick,
I was the one nearby her bedside every night

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.360
while you stayed at work late.

01:02:28.485 --> 01:02:31.068
That's how you handle anything
involving actual human emotion.

01:02:31.152 --> 01:02:35.652
I felt so alone after she killed herself,
I had nobody.

01:02:36.651 --> 01:02:38.360
Did you ever stop to think about that?

01:02:38.651 --> 01:02:40.735
Did you ever stop to think about this?

01:02:40.818 --> 01:02:43.735
You're not the only one who lost somebody.

01:02:45.985 --> 01:02:48.943
Yeah, just keep popping your pills
to numb the pain.

01:02:49.319 --> 01:02:50.776
I'll be fine on my own.

01:03:47.651 --> 01:03:49.276
Rose, is that you?

01:03:50.068 --> 01:03:52.276
I'm so sorry I said what I said to you.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:00.984
Oh, my God.

01:04:02.651 --> 01:04:04.941
I came in here and it was like this.

01:04:06.984 --> 01:04:07.984
I didn't do this.

01:04:08.024 --> 01:04:10.151
- Just get out, please. Just go.
- Dad, I swear.

01:04:10.234 --> 01:04:11.442
Go!

01:04:11.692 --> 01:04:12.901
Get out!

01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:19.025
<i>Maybe you were so upset
you don't remember doing it.</i>

01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:21.523
No, that's not what happened.

01:04:21.565 --> 01:04:24.150
Something in this house
is trying to communicate with me.

01:04:24.775 --> 01:04:26.526
It's absolutely happening.

01:04:27.193 --> 01:04:28.442
And now Leila is missing.

01:04:28.692 --> 01:04:30.691
She's probably off with Kyle somewhere.

01:04:30.858 --> 01:04:32.400
Kind of like Rachel and Marcus?

01:04:33.026 --> 01:04:37.318
Marcus was trying to protect Rachel,
and things went too far.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.858
Cheri did something awful to them,
that's why she left town.

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:44.068
Rose, you can't bring her back.

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:47.858
No, but I can at least try to figure out
what happened to her.

01:04:48.483 --> 01:04:50.775
That's not who I'm talking about.

01:04:53.984 --> 01:04:57.566
You suffered a major loss, it's your mom.

01:04:57.649 --> 01:04:59.233
There's nothing worse than that.

01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:04.898
Your pain, it's starting
to come out in other ways.

01:05:04.983 --> 01:05:06.484
Don't you see?

01:05:09.566 --> 01:05:11.067
You sound just like my dad.

01:05:11.565 --> 01:05:13.941
Why, 'cause I'm worried about you?

01:05:14.234 --> 01:05:15.400
Where are you going?

01:05:15.484 --> 01:05:18.483
Look, just 'cause we kissed
doesn't mean we're together, okay?

01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:20.442
You're not my boyfriend.

01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:24.566
So, is this your thing?
Someone gets too close, you shut 'em out?

01:05:24.899 --> 01:05:26.525
- Give me the keys.
- What?

01:05:27.193 --> 01:05:28.192
Now!

01:05:28.274 --> 01:05:31.649
I don't want you coming
in and out as you please!

01:05:34.774 --> 01:05:36.358
- Now get out!
- Rose, I have a job...

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.773
Out!

01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:42.399
Can we please talk about this?

01:05:42.483 --> 01:05:44.357
There's nothing to talk about.

01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:49.148
You're right, I'm not well.
Let's just leave it at that.

01:05:56.814 --> 01:05:59.984
Hi, the lady upstairs directed me to you.

01:06:00.816 --> 01:06:03.399
I'm looking for the original blueprints
to our house.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.984
We don't usually get
too many young people down here.

01:06:07.399 --> 01:06:10.606
Yeah, my dad misplaced his copy,
so I'm just trying to help him out.

01:06:11.148 --> 01:06:14.690
Well, blueprints are generally filed
with the corresponding building permit.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.774
Can you give me the name
of the previous owner?

01:06:16.942 --> 01:06:19.897
- Yeah, Garrison.
- Just a second.

01:06:21.897 --> 01:06:23.608
Garrison, Garrison.

01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:28.647
Watch your step.

01:06:29.482 --> 01:06:33.107
Cheri Garrison, 340 Laura.

01:06:41.814 --> 01:06:43.481
Got it.

01:07:03.523 --> 01:07:04.981
Dad?

01:07:37.982 --> 01:07:39.189
Hello?

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.857
My phone's about to die, can you hold on?

01:07:42.481 --> 01:07:45.107
I need to get my phone charger. Hello?

01:07:46.898 --> 01:07:48.022
Shit.

01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:29.270
Rose! Rose!

01:09:31.937 --> 01:09:34.313
Rose? Rose?

01:09:34.979 --> 01:09:36.104
Rose?

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:39.644
Breathing's back to normal,
heart rate is good.

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.644
Right now she just needs some rest.

01:09:42.104 --> 01:09:44.437
Are any prescription pain medications
kept in the house?

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.353
Like hydrocodone, oxycodone?

01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:50.060
Yeah. I'm on pain meds,
I had back surgery last year.

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:52.979
I'm asking you this
because your daughter's symptoms

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.686
are consistent with this type of misuse.

01:10:38.228 --> 01:10:39.518
Hey.

01:10:40.895 --> 01:10:42.312
How do you feel?

01:10:43.394 --> 01:10:45.018
What are you doing?

01:10:45.268 --> 01:10:46.936
I made you some soup.

01:10:54.729 --> 01:10:57.644
When was the last time
you took one of these?

01:10:58.269 --> 01:11:00.144
Why didn't you tell me that you ran out?

01:11:03.517 --> 01:11:05.061
I forgot.

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:13.685
Are you trying to hurt yourself?

01:11:15.269 --> 01:11:17.602
How many of my pills did you take?

01:11:18.852 --> 01:11:20.769
I never touched your pills.

01:11:22.685 --> 01:11:25.604
Rose, the paramedic said
your symptoms were consistent

01:11:25.645 --> 01:11:27.560
with an overdose of hydrocodone.

01:11:28.268 --> 01:11:29.728
That's impossible.

01:11:32.143 --> 01:11:33.560
And you believe them?

01:11:40.435 --> 01:11:42.768
I left some water for you right there.

01:11:42.852 --> 01:11:45.768
Do you want anything? Juice? Tea?

01:11:46.852 --> 01:11:50.894
Wait, yesterday when I came home
I had some juice.

01:11:50.936 --> 01:11:52.767
I remember it tasted funny.

01:11:53.016 --> 01:11:55.226
Right afterwards
that's when I started feeling dizzy.

01:11:55.476 --> 01:11:57.018
Are you saying you were drugged?

01:12:03.767 --> 01:12:05.602
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:14:29.099 --> 01:14:30.099
<i>Hey, it's Jerry.</i>

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.600
Just call me back
as soon as you get this, please.

01:16:26.388 --> 01:16:28.514
Stop, stop, I don't want to hurt you.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.096
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.

01:16:32.723 --> 01:16:34.347
So don't make me.

01:16:43.264 --> 01:16:45.013
What do you want from me?

01:16:51.931 --> 01:16:54.389
I want you to put on the dress.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.723
My dad's gonna be home any minute.

01:16:59.763 --> 01:17:02.014
We both know that isn't true.

01:17:02.889 --> 01:17:04.638
Don't lie.

01:17:09.847 --> 01:17:11.222
No!

01:17:15.806 --> 01:17:17.388
Stop crying!

01:17:18.137 --> 01:17:21.054
People get hurt when they cry.

01:17:34.387 --> 01:17:35.805
Why are you doing this?

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:38.097
'Cause it's so much fun!

01:17:41.137 --> 01:17:42.597
Just kidding.

01:17:46.722 --> 01:17:48.848
It's been you the whole time.

01:17:48.973 --> 01:17:50.555
I get to keep you.

01:17:51.804 --> 01:17:54.929
You should be glad, Rachel wasn't so lucky.

01:18:01.054 --> 01:18:04.597
My mother didn't agree with our relationship.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:07.428
She made me do it.

01:18:10.846 --> 01:18:13.346
She made me do all kinds of things.

01:18:14.346 --> 01:18:16.263
God's good intention.

01:18:16.846 --> 01:18:19.720
She said,

01:18:19.803 --> 01:18:23.804
the almighty hand of the Lord!
Put on the dress!

01:18:28.597 --> 01:18:32.555
I never hurt my mother
or fought with her before Rachel.

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:38.262
You and me, we're the same.

01:18:38.554 --> 01:18:42.347
We both lost our mothers,
and that's what brought us together.

01:18:52.096 --> 01:18:54.094
That was Rachel's dress.

01:18:56.136 --> 01:18:59.262
I'm so glad that you
wanted to know what happened to her.

01:18:59.346 --> 01:19:00.470
Rachel's the reason.

01:19:00.552 --> 01:19:03.846
The reason that I ended up
in this house all by myself.

01:19:13.053 --> 01:19:14.469
I don't want to hide any more.

01:19:34.095 --> 01:19:36.761
You're even more beautiful
than I ever imagined.

01:19:41.593 --> 01:19:42.719
It's okay.

01:19:43.428 --> 01:19:45.220
I'm nervous too.

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.344
No!

01:20:20.051 --> 01:20:21.051
No!

01:21:55.508 --> 01:21:57.177
I like this game.

01:21:58.134 --> 01:22:00.093
I like this game so much.

01:22:24.427 --> 01:22:25.633
He'll hear you.

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:28.051
- He'll hear you.
- Where are you, Rosy Rose?

01:22:28.217 --> 01:22:30.094
Where are you, my sweet?

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:36.509
Rosy Rose.

01:22:37.258 --> 01:22:39.133
Okay.

01:22:40.384 --> 01:22:41.757
Rosy Rose?

01:23:03.675 --> 01:23:06.467
Have I found my true one?

01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:09.633
Have I?

01:23:26.341 --> 01:23:29.423
You're being awfully quiet!

01:23:37.883 --> 01:23:39.839
I'll come back for you.

01:24:54.548 --> 01:24:55.671
Dad!

01:24:56.798 --> 01:24:58.172
Dad!

01:24:59.005 --> 01:25:00.173
Dad!

01:25:01.547 --> 01:25:02.547
No!

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.214
It's not supposed to be like this, Rose!

01:25:08.255 --> 01:25:10.881
Stop, you're not like the others.

01:25:12.172 --> 01:25:13.172
Stop it!

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.465
Rose, Rose!

01:25:20.547 --> 01:25:23.423
Are you okay? Rose. Rose, are you okay?

01:25:23.922 --> 01:25:25.297
Rose.

01:25:27.298 --> 01:25:28.464
No, stop!

01:25:30.297 --> 01:25:31.380
No!

01:25:31.547 --> 01:25:33.298
Marcus, stop!

01:25:43.965 --> 01:25:45.213
Like I said...

01:25:47.881 --> 01:25:50.255
You're prettier than I imagined.

01:26:06.297 --> 01:26:07.841
Dad!

01:26:10.463 --> 01:26:11.755
Help me.

01:27:20.045 --> 01:27:23.462
Well, it's not much,
but at least our stuff has arrived.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:26.544
Anything's better
than that hotel for another month.

01:27:26.627 --> 01:27:28.545
Well, maybe not anything.

01:27:29.462 --> 01:27:31.879
But, this is exactly what I wanted.

01:27:31.921 --> 01:27:34.837
No musty basement, no creepy attic.

01:27:36.212 --> 01:27:38.129
We're getting new appliances next week.

01:27:38.213 --> 01:27:40.379
It already feels like a home.

01:27:41.503 --> 01:27:43.046
Thanks again for helping out.

01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:45.295
Glad I could be of service.

01:27:45.545 --> 01:27:47.672
So, your first day of school tomorrow.

01:27:47.714 --> 01:27:50.713
It's not Stanford,
but Northwestern ain't too shabby either.

01:27:51.004 --> 01:27:52.004
You nervous?

01:27:52.045 --> 01:27:53.087
No.

01:27:53.378 --> 01:27:55.545
Maybe there will be
some cute guys in my classes.

01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:58.004
Be careful, your boyfriend might get jealous.

01:27:58.088 --> 01:28:00.837
- He's got nothing to worry about.
- Really?

01:28:02.087 --> 01:28:03.378
Come on.
