SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE HAD A

HE'S GONNA LIE IN PERSON OR ON

02:33.533 --> 02:34.667
LOOK AT THE MAYOR.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.667
HE SAID THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE

02:36.667 --> 02:37.733
AND THEN I FIND OUT THAT THERE'S

02:37.733 --> 02:38.633
ALL THESE OTHER WOMEN.

02:38.633 --> 02:39.967
I MEAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

02:39.967 --> 02:41.800
>> NO, I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THE

02:41.800 --> 02:43.333
MAN WHO WAS CHEATING ON HIS WIFE

02:43.333 --> 02:44.967
WOULD SINK SO LOW AS TO CHEAT ON

02:44.967 --> 02:45.933
HIS MISTRESS.

WOMAN ACTUALLY GETS OFFENDED

02:49.100 --> 02:50.533
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT THERE'S

02:50.533 --> 02:51.767
ANOTHER OTHER WOMAN.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.200
>> THIS CONVERSATION WAS A LOT

02:53.200 --> 02:54.300
MORE FUN WHEN WE WERE PICKING ON

02:59.200 --> 03:00.500
COMPATIBLE WITH THESE GUYS

03:00.500 --> 03:01.500
BEFORE I MEET THEM BECAUSE WE'VE

03:01.500 --> 03:02.767
CHECKED ALL THE SAME BOXES.

03:02.767 --> 03:03.967
IT'S BRILLIANT.

03:03.967 --> 03:05.067
WE CAN GET ALL THE BAD STUFF OUT

03:05.067 --> 03:06.167
OF THE WAY AND JUST FALL IN

03:06.167 --> 03:07.133
LOVE.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.600
>> BUT THAT IS THE BAD STUFF.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.767
IF YOU FALL IN LOVE, YOU'RE

03:10.767 --> 03:11.933
GONNA GET HURT.

03:22.067 --> 03:25.333
CYNICISM IN THIS ROOM.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.433
YOU KNOW, I'M THE ONE WHO JUST

03:27.433 --> 03:28.400
CAME OUT OF A FIVE-YEAR

03:28.400 --> 03:30.000
RELATIONSHIP AND LOOK AT ME NOW.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
BACK ON THE HORSE AND READY TO

03:31.000 --> 03:33.067
GO.

03:33.067 --> 03:34.600
>> VAL, I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR

03:34.600 --> 03:36.633
TRYING ONLINE DATING, BUT THAT'S

03:36.633 --> 03:37.900
JUST NOT MY CUP OF TEA.

03:37.900 --> 03:38.900
>> THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT

03:38.900 --> 03:39.833
"I'M A GOLD DIGGER" IN YOUR

03:39.833 --> 03:41.567
PROFILE.

03:41.567 --> 03:43.167

ME SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

03:46.133 --> 03:48.433
I WANT A GUY LIKE MY FATHER.

03:48.433 --> 03:49.733
HE KNEW HOW TO TREAT THE TWO

03:49.733 --> 03:51.233
MOST IMPORTANT WOMEN IN HIS

03:51.233 --> 03:51.933
LIFE.

03:51.933 --> 03:53.567
ME AND MY MOTHER WERE WELL TAKEN

03:53.567 --> 03:54.367
CARE OF.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.333
>> BUT WHY DOES A MAN HAVE TO DO

03:55.333 --> 03:56.267
ANYTHING FOR YOU?

03:56.267 --> 03:57.133
WHY CAN'T YOU EARN YOUR OWN

03:57.133 --> 03:57.967
MONEY?

03:57.967 --> 03:58.867
AND I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT YOUR

03:58.867 --> 03:59.967
LITTLE GAMBLING ADDICTION,

04:04.733 --> 04:06.900
REALITY IS, I MAKE POKER WORK

04:06.900 --> 04:08.233
FOR ME SO I WON'T HAVE TO WORK

04:08.233 --> 04:10.333
FOR ANYONE ELSE, AND I'VE MADE

04:10.333 --> 04:11.867
MORE IN ONE NIGHT THAN YOU'LL

04:11.867 --> 04:13.200
SEE ALL YEAR.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.300
>> SO YOU COULD MAKE ALL THAT

04:14.300 --> 04:15.433
MONEY ON YOUR OWN, THEN WHY DO

04:15.433 --> 04:16.533
YOU NEED A RICH MAN?

04:16.533 --> 04:18.367
>> BECAUSE MY MONEY IS MY MONEY

>> OF COURSE.

05:09.467 --> 05:10.800
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.000
>> YOU CAN START BY TELLING YOUR

05:12.000 --> 05:13.100
FRIEND TO STOP SCREWING MY

05:13.100 --> 05:14.233
HUSBAND.

HAPPENING, I WAS HOPING YOU

05:20.167 --> 05:21.667
COULD DESIGN SOMETHING.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.200
WALKED OVER TO YOUR TABLE THAT

06:58.200 --> 06:59.000
NIGHT.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.233
>> YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE

07:00.233 --> 07:01.667
THAT WAS THREE MONTHS AGO.

07:01.667 --> 07:02.767
>> HMM.

07:02.767 --> 07:04.600
COME ON, LET'S GO GET LOST.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.667
>> MM-MM.

07:05.667 --> 07:06.467
>> OH, SEE, I DON'T LIKE THIS

07:06.467 --> 07:07.300
PART OF THE GAME.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.500
>> [laughs] WHAT PART?

07:08.500 --> 07:09.167
>> WHAT PART?

07:09.167 --> 07:09.900
THE PART THAT KEEPS ME FROM

07:09.900 --> 07:10.867
KNOWING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE

07:10.867 --> 07:11.667

07:11.667 --> 07:12.533
THAT'S WHAT PART.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.400
>> MALCOLM, AS CHARMING AS YOU

07:15.400 --> 07:16.300
ARE...

07:16.300 --> 07:17.033
>> MM-HMM.

07:17.033 --> 07:18.000
>> OUR FIRST TIME WON'T BE A

07:18.000 --> 07:19.067
QUICKIE IN A MANSION YOU'RE

07:19.067 --> 07:20.767
BUYING FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.100
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.133
BUT THEN YOU GOTTA DO ME A

07:23.133 --> 07:23.933
FAVOR.

07:23.933 --> 07:24.967
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE

07:24.967 --> 07:25.667
SEEING ME...

07:25.667 --> 07:26.367
>> HMM?

07:26.367 --> 07:28.900
>> TRY NOT TO LOOK SO DAMN GOOD.

07:28.900 --> 07:34.333
>> HUH, OKAY.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.733
[sighs]

07:36.733 --> 07:40.100
SO, DO YOU TAKE ALL YOUR WOMEN

07:40.100 --> 07:41.100
TO HELP YOU PICK OUT ESTATES FOR

07:41.100 --> 07:42.067
YOUR FAMILY?

07:42.067 --> 07:44.100
>> [laughs]

07:44.100 --> 07:46.467
WHEN I LIKE THEM.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.800
>> OH.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
SO HOW MANY HOUSES ARE YOU

07:48.800 --> 07:49.667
LOOKING AT THESE DAYS?

07:49.667 --> 07:50.833
>> OH, JUST THIS ONE, KEISHA,

07:50.833 --> 07:52.300
JUST THIS ONE.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.933
I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.400
AND HOW ABOUT YOU, KEISHA?

07:55.400 --> 07:56.467
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU WENT

07:56.467 --> 07:57.400
HOUSE HUNTING?

07:57.400 --> 07:58.433
>> HUH.

07:58.433 --> 08:00.133
I'M ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT.

08:00.133 --> 08:02.033
BUT RARELY DO I FIND THEM WITH

08:02.033 --> 08:04.433
THE STYLE AND QUALITY OF THIS

08:04.433 --> 08:06.400
ONE.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.233
>> WELL, ISN'T THE HOUSE

08:09.233 --> 08:11.733
PERFECT?

08:11.733 --> 08:12.733
>> OH, I'M GONNA TELL YOU

08:12.733 --> 08:15.633
AFTER I SEE DOWNSTAIRS.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.833

08:30.833 --> 08:32.400
[laughs]

08:32.400 --> 08:33.067
OH, HEY!

08:33.067 --> 08:33.733
>> HEY.

08:33.733 --> 08:34.567
>> I THOUGHT YOU WENT OUT

08:34.567 --> 08:35.233
TONIGHT.

08:35.233 --> 08:36.067
>> I CAN'T BE AVAILABLE ALL

08:36.067 --> 08:36.767
THE TIME.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.933
MYSTIQUE IS PART OF THE GAME,

08:37.933 --> 08:38.900
BABY.

08:38.900 --> 08:39.733
>> RIGHT.

08:39.733 --> 08:40.667
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

08:40.667 --> 08:42.167
>> GOING THROUGH MY COUPLEUS.COM

08:42.167 --> 08:42.833
MAIL.

08:42.833 --> 08:43.967
IT'S SO MUCH FUN.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.000
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.167
CUTE.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.467
>> "I PICKED OUT MY WEDDING

08:49.967 --> 08:51.333

08:53.500 --> 08:54.333
>> HOW LONG YOU BEEN CHATTING

08:54.333 --> 08:55.000
WITH HIM?

08:55.000 --> 08:55.833
>> FIVE OR TEN MINUTES.

08:55.833 --> 08:56.767
I PUT "L-O-L."

08:56.767 --> 08:57.767
>> YOU CAN'T GIVE A GUY ALL THAT

08:57.767 --> 08:59.133
INFORMATION TOO SOON.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.800
YOU GOTTA KNOW WHEN TO HOLD

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
AND WHEN TO FOLD.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.233
JEEZ.

09:03.233 --> 09:04.233
>> KEISHA, THINK ABOUT IT.

09:04.233 --> 09:05.233
I'VE HAD TWO SERIOUS

09:05.233 --> 09:07.833
RELATIONSHIPS IN MY LIFE.

09:07.833 --> 09:08.567
I'VE NEVER HAD TO PLAY THESE

09:08.567 --> 09:09.233
STUPID GAMES.

09:09.233 --> 09:10.300
BESIDES, IF I WANT SOMETHING,

09:10.300 --> 09:11.800
WHY CAN'T I JUST SAY IT?

09:11.800 --> 09:13.733
AND I WANT LOVE, DAMN IT.

09:13.733 --> 09:16.100
>> YES, BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

09:16.100 --> 09:18.033
GO OUT AND GET YOU SOME.

09:18.033 --> 09:20.700
>> I CAN'T JUST HAVE RANDOM SEX.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.200
IT HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.367
>> SOMETIMES IT MEANS YOU'RE

09:23.367 --> 09:24.400
HORNY.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.833
SOMETIMES IT MEANS RENT.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.533
SOMETIMES IT MEANS A NEW PAIR

09:27.533 --> 09:28.867
OF SHOES AND A BAG.

09:28.867 --> 09:30.533
HOW MUCH MEANING DO YOU NEED?

09:30.533 --> 09:32.200
>> I WANT THE FAIRY TALE.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.600
I WANT MY PRINCE TO COME IN

09:33.600 --> 09:34.933
AND SWEEP ME OFF MY FEET.

09:34.933 --> 09:35.900
>> THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

09:35.900 --> 09:37.233
US.

09:37.233 --> 09:38.333
YOU WANT THE PRINCE.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.167
I WANT THE CASTLE.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.967
AND IF I HAPPEN TO FALL IN LOVE

09:40.967 --> 09:42.300
WITH THE OWNER OF THAT CASTLE,

09:42.300 --> 09:43.833
THEN I'M SURE I'LL APPRECIATE

09:43.833 --> 09:44.500
IT.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.333
>> SO HOW ARE YOU AND MALCOLM

09:45.333 --> 09:46.500
DOING ANYWAY?

09:46.500 --> 09:48.200
>> REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.533
PLUS, HE HASN'T MENTIONED

09:49.533 --> 09:50.700
THE WATCH AND I HAVEN'T HEARD

09:50.700 --> 09:51.533
FROM JASMINE.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.033
SO I THINK THAT CHAPTER OF MY

09:53.033 --> 09:54.733
LIFE IS CLOSED.

09:54.733 --> 09:55.567
>> LOOK AT YOU.

09:55.567 --> 09:56.300
[gasps]

09:56.300 --> 09:57.800
ALL SMILEY JUST TALKING ABOUT

09:57.800 --> 09:58.833
HIM.

09:58.833 --> 09:59.833
SO HAVEN'T YOU MADE HIM WAIT

09:59.833 --> 10:00.833
LONG ENOUGH?

10:00.833 --> 10:02.400
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA, YOU KNOW?

10:02.400 --> 10:03.633
>> I CAN'T GO THERE YET.

10:03.633 --> 10:05.900
I GOTTA PLAY THIS ONE RIGHT.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.733
>> ALWAYS A GAME.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.067
YOU LIKE MALCOLM.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.067
THAT'S THE REAL REASON WHY YOU

10:10.067 --> 10:11.000
WON'T SLEEP WITH HIM.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.233
I KNOW MY BEST FRIEND.

10:13.233 --> 10:14.867
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING A GUY,

10:14.867 --> 10:15.867
YOU DON'T GIVE IT UP.

10:15.867 --> 10:16.867
>> THAT'S BACKWARDS.

10:16.867 --> 10:17.700
WHY WOULDN'T I GIVE IT UP TO

10:17.700 --> 10:19.400
SOMEONE I REALLY LIKE?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.067
>> BABY, THAT IS FOR YOU AND

10:21.067 --> 10:22.567
YOUR THERAPIST TO FIGURE OUT.

10:22.567 --> 10:25.200
I'M GOING TO BED.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.600

10:33.167 --> 10:37.067
[heavy breathing]

10:51.033 --> 10:53.700
>> WHERE WERE YOU?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.867
>> BABY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

10:55.867 --> 10:56.867
EARLIER.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.533
I HAD LUNCH WITH VAL AND THEN

10:58.533 --> 10:59.200
I HAD TO WORK LATE.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.600
>> NO, NO.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.100
NO, WHERE WERE YOU JUST NOW?

11:03.100 --> 11:04.433
BECAUSE I WAS INSIDE YOU

11:04.433 --> 11:05.433
AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN

11:05.433 --> 11:06.867
FURTHER FROM ME.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.033

25:18.133 --> 25:19.100
COULDN'T GET THE DETAILS.

>> DETAILS, PLEASE.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.300
THIS IS MALCOLM.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.200
IT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING

25:40.200 --> 25:44.300
FOR.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.933
>> ACTUALLY, I WOULD'VE

25:45.933 --> 25:46.967
PREFERRED TO HAVE WAITED A

25:46.967 --> 25:48.133
LITTLE LONGER.

25:48.133 --> 25:49.400
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING OVER TO

25:49.400 --> 25:51.533
JUST CHILL, BUT WHEN I GOT THERE

25:51.533 --> 25:52.333
HE HAD A COPY OF JASMINE'S

25:52.333 --> 25:53.033
MANUSCRIPT.

25:55.000 --> 25:55.933
WENT INTO SURVIVAL MODE.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.100
DIVERSION?

25:58.100 --> 25:58.900
>> THAT'S HOW IT STARTED.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.900
BUT ONCE WE GOT INTO IT,

26:01.900 --> 26:03.867
IT TURNED INTO SOMETHING VERY

26:03.867 --> 26:04.600
DIFFERENT.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.467
I HATE TO SOUND CORNY LIKE YOU,

26:06.467 --> 26:08.167
BUT IT REALLY FELT SPECIAL.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.433
KIND OF MAGICAL IN A WAY.

26:10.433 --> 26:11.700
[giggles]

26:11.700 --> 26:13.933
IT FELT SO GOOD I ALMOST SPENT

26:13.933 --> 26:14.633
THE NIGHT.

26:14.633 --> 26:15.967
AND YOU KNOW I DON'T DO THAT.

26:15.967 --> 26:17.267
>> [sighs]

26:17.267 --> 26:18.233
WHY NOT?

26:18.233 --> 26:20.000
YOU LIKE HIM.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.867
>> I DO.

26:21.867 --> 26:23.133
BUT THAT'S JUST GIVING UP TOO

26:23.133 --> 26:24.367
MUCH POWER.

26:24.367 --> 26:25.300
AND BESIDES, I DIDN'T HAVE A

26:25.300 --> 26:26.800
CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND I WASN'T

26:26.800 --> 26:28.300
DOING THE WALK OF SHAME THIS

26:28.300 --> 26:30.567
MORNING.

26:30.567 --> 26:33.133
>> WHAT ARE YOU NOT TELLING ME?

26:33.133 --> 26:36.233
>> HE HASN'T CALLED ALL DAY.

26:36.233 --> 26:37.567
>> NO.

26:37.567 --> 26:38.300
WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.367
IT'S OKAY.

26:39.367 --> 26:40.333
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S

26:40.333 --> 26:42.533
ONLY--OOH.

26:42.533 --> 26:44.700
WOW, IT'S 4:00.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.400
MAYBE HE'S STILL ASLEEP.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.567
OR WORKING.

26:47.567 --> 26:49.267
DO YOU HAVE SERVICE?

26:49.267 --> 26:51.167
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IN THIS SPOT,

26:51.167 --> 26:52.433
I DON'T KNOW GET ANY RECEPTION.

26:52.433 --> 26:57.467
>> MM, I HAVE FOUR BARS, VAL.

26:57.467 --> 26:58.333
HE'LL CALL.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.167
>> YEAH.

26:59.167 --> 26:59.933
HE WILL.

26:59.933 --> 27:00.667
>> I'M NOT WORRIED.

27:00.667 --> 27:01.400
>> MM-MM.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.233
>> HE'S JUST PLAYING HIS LITTLE

27:02.233 --> 27:02.900
GAME.

>> [giggles]

27:11.233 --> 27:12.267
>> OH.

27:12.267 --> 27:15.367
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.567
>> VAL, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU IN

27:16.567 --> 27:18.400
PRIVATE?

27:18.400 --> 27:21.300
>> SURE.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.567
>> DID YOU KNOW?

27:32.567 --> 27:33.867
LET ME BE MORE SPECIFIC.

27:33.867 --> 27:35.400
WHEN I CAME INTO THE STORE THAT

27:35.400 --> 27:37.233
DAY LOOKING FOR APRIL, DID YOU

27:37.233 --> 27:38.367
KNOW SHE WAS WITH HIM?

27:38.367 --> 27:39.533
>> DARRYL, PLEASE DON'T PUT ME

27:39.533 --> 27:40.367
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.567
>> IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.

27:41.567 --> 27:43.400
DO I NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU

27:43.400 --> 27:45.100
AND I WERE FRIENDS FIRST?

27:45.100 --> 27:47.033
THAT YOU SLEPT ON MY COUCH IN

27:47.033 --> 27:48.367
COLLEGE WHEN YOU GOT EVICTED?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.700
THAT YOU INTRODUCED ME TO APRIL?

27:50.700 --> 27:52.433
WE'VE ALWAYS LOOKED OUT FOR EACH

27:52.433 --> 27:53.533
OTHER, VAL.

27:53.533 --> 27:55.233
>> THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS SO

27:55.233 --> 27:56.400
MESSED UP, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

27:56.400 --> 27:57.400
WHAT TO SAY.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.567
>> YOU COULD'VE GIVEN ME A HEADS

27:58.567 --> 28:00.200
UP, A WARNING!

28:00.200 --> 28:01.467
THAT'S WHAT A REAL FRIEND DOES.

28:01.467 --> 28:02.933
INSTEAD OF HELPING TO MAKE ME

28:02.933 --> 28:04.067
LOOK LIKE A DAMN FOOL.

28:04.067 --> 28:05.633
>> IT WAS HARD.

28:05.633 --> 28:08.367
I LOVE BOTH OF YOU.

28:08.367 --> 28:10.900
I WISH I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.833
DARRYL, I AM SO SORRY.

28:12.833 --> 28:13.667
>> YEAH.

28:13.667 --> 28:15.300
YOU DEFINITELY ARE THAT...

28:15.300 --> 28:18.000
SORRY.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.900
>> THAT'S UNFAIR.

28:28.567 --> 28:30.500
>> YEE-HAW!

28:30.500 --> 28:33.900
WHOO!

28:33.900 --> 28:35.200
>> THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY

28:35.200 --> 28:36.333
RESCUE AGAIN.

28:36.333 --> 28:38.900
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, I DIDN'T

28:38.900 --> 28:41.000
EXPECT FLOORS COVERED IN SAWDUST

28:41.000 --> 28:42.067
AND PEANUT SHELLS.

28:42.067 --> 28:42.800
>> YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO

28:42.800 --> 28:44.233
ESCAPE AND THIS IS ONE OF MY

28:44.233 --> 28:45.200
FAVORITE PLACES.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.333
>> IT'S SO GOOD THAT WE'RE BOTH

28:46.333 --> 28:47.367
OUR OWN BOSSES.

28:47.367 --> 28:48.333
WE CAN DO THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF

28:48.333 --> 28:49.667
THE DAY AND NOT GET FIRED.

28:49.667 --> 28:50.867
>> CHEERS TO THAT.

28:50.867 --> 28:51.567
>> CHEERS.

28:51.567 --> 28:55.300
>> [chuckles]

28:55.300 --> 28:56.400
>> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.467
>> OH, BOY.

28:57.467 --> 28:58.333
ANOTHER VAL QUESTION.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.633
>> [giggles]

28:59.633 --> 29:00.467
>> ALL RIGHT, WE COVERED THE

29:00.467 --> 29:01.733
RACE THING.

29:01.733 --> 29:03.167
I ALREADY TOLD YOU I LOST MY

29:03.167 --> 29:04.467
VIRGINITY TO MY BABYSITTER.

29:04.467 --> 29:06.900
AND, YES, I THINK ABOUT YOU ALL

29:06.900 --> 29:07.633
THE TIME.

29:07.633 --> 29:08.933
>> OH!

29:08.933 --> 29:09.767
THAT'S SO SWEET.

29:09.767 --> 29:11.600
BUT, NO, IT'S A HYPOTHETICAL

29:11.600 --> 29:12.500
SCENARIO.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.267
OKAY, SAY YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH

29:14.267 --> 29:15.367
A COUPLE, RIGHT?

37:23.800 --> 37:25.633
I BLAME TREVOR BECAUSE HE BROKE

37:25.633 --> 37:27.200
HIS COMMITMENT TO ME.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.133
BUT I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN

37:29.133 --> 37:31.133
LIKE YOU WHO RECKLESSLY TEAR

37:31.133 --> 37:33.500
THROUGH OTHER WOMEN'S LIVES.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.233
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT, HMM?

37:36.233 --> 37:37.600
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT YOUR

37:37.600 --> 37:39.900
LEGS CLOSED THEN LIKE YOU'RE

37:39.900 --> 37:42.367

37:48.933 --> 37:51.200
* BUT YOU NEVER GIVE

37:51.200 --> 37:52.200
* SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

37:52.200 --> 37:53.400
* YOU WAS TROUBLE

37:53.400 --> 37:55.033
* FROM THE FIRST KISS

37:55.033 --> 37:58.100
* HAD YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN

37:58.100 --> 37:59.867
* WHY WERE THEY OPEN?

37:59.867 --> 38:01.333
* GAVE YOU ALL I HAD

38:01.333 --> 38:02.600
* AND YOU TOSSED IT

38:02.600 --> 38:03.800
* IN THE TRASH

38:03.800 --> 38:05.967
* YOU TOSSED IT IN THE TRASH

38:05.967 --> 38:07.267
>> OH!

38:07.267 --> 38:09.333
THAT WAS SO SWEET.

38:09.333 --> 38:11.300
DID YOU SEE HOW HE RAN TO HER

38:11.300 --> 38:12.367
JUST TO GET THAT KISS AT

38:12.367 --> 38:13.533
MIDNIGHT?

38:13.533 --> 38:14.900
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.800
OR A MAN IN UNIFORM TO CARRY ME

38:16.800 --> 38:18.400
OFF THE FACTORY FLOOR TO THE

38:18.400 --> 38:19.433
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE OF MY

38:19.433 --> 38:21.300
CO-WORKERS.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.767
>> OKAY, I'M REVOKING YOUR

38:22.767 --> 38:23.900
NETFLIX CARD.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.200
>> WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.467
PLEASE.

38:26.467 --> 38:27.700
WHY DON'T THEY TELL YOU HOW IT

38:27.700 --> 38:28.867
REALLY GOES DOWN?

38:28.867 --> 38:30.267
LIKE WHEN MALCOLM MET KEISHA,

38:30.267 --> 38:31.800
THEN SLEPT WITH HER AND DIDN'T

38:31.800 --> 38:32.633
CALL FOR DAYS.

38:32.633 --> 38:33.567
THE END.

38:33.567 --> 38:34.700
>> HE'S GONNA CALL.

38:34.700 --> 38:35.600
>> I WASN'T SAYING THAT TO GET

38:35.600 --> 38:36.700
SYMPATHY.

38:36.700 --> 38:37.833
I'M LIKE JAY-Z.

38:37.833 --> 38:39.167
I'M ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.233
I DON'T LIVE IN A FANTASY WORLD

38:41.133 --> 38:41.967
>> [scoffs]

38:41.967 --> 38:44.167
OKAY, IT WAS NAIVE OF ME TO

38:44.167 --> 38:45.367
THINK I COULD FIND MY PERFECT

38:45.367 --> 38:47.567
MATCH ON A DATING WEBSITE.

38:47.567 --> 38:49.100
BECAUSE EVEN IF HE'S PERFECT ON

38:49.100 --> 38:50.700
PAPER, HE'S STILL GONNA HAVE

38:50.700 --> 38:52.367
FAULTS, BUT IN THE END, IT IS

38:52.367 --> 38:53.600
WORTH THE RISK.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.133
>> GUYS, SERIOUSLY.

39:05.767 --> 39:06.633
SOMETHING ELSE WORTH TALKING

39:06.633 --> 39:07.567
ABOUT, RIGHT?

39:07.567 --> 39:09.200
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.800
WHY DON'T WE DO SOMETHING

39:10.800 --> 39:15.833
DIFFERENT AND EXCITING?

39:15.833 --> 39:17.200
WE SHOULD GO SKYDIVING.

39:25.100 --> 39:26.533
HE WAS SO SEXY.

39:26.533 --> 39:27.633
I SHOULD EMAIL HIM.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.933
NO.

39:29.933 --> 39:30.800
THAT WOULD BE TOO DESPERATE,

39:30.800 --> 39:31.567
RIGHT?

39:31.567 --> 39:32.533
>> WOW, REALLY?

39:32.533 --> 39:33.867
THAT WAS MAYBE TEN SECONDS AND

39:33.867 --> 39:34.967
I'M BEING GENEROUS.
