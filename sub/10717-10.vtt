WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:03.328
(engine revs)
(tires screech)

00:07.070 --> 00:08.628
WOMAN (announcing):
Archer. All new.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.729
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.010 --> 00:15.332
FX presents The Americans.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.841
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:19.880 --> 00:22.041
Listen,
I have to thank you again

00:22.090 --> 00:23.512
for another
fantastic deal.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.381
Those rates were even better
than the ones for Kenya.

00:25.420 --> 00:26.978
Honestly,
we should be thanking you.

00:27.020 --> 00:29.329
You and the church
have been great for business.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.658
They asked me to come up
and see the Director.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.191
Well,
that could be anything.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.857
I'm pretty sure

00:34.900 --> 00:37.095
they're not calling me up
for a commendation, Stan.

00:37.130 --> 00:38.563
PHILIP: What happened
to your old boss?

00:38.600 --> 00:42.161
He retired. He's going
on a long trip to Thailand.

00:42.210 --> 00:46.601
The most virulent pathogens
are on Biocontainment Level 4.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.574
I don't have access
to Level 4.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.202
PHILIP: We're working on
getting you the access code.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.775
ELIZABETH:
I didn't find anything.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.776
-Hello.
-H|, Don.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.185
You should plan
dinner for the kids

00:56.220 --> 00:58.518
because
I'll be home late.

00:58.550 --> 01:00.188
We don't have to
go through with it.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.414
We've been over this.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.519
I'm not saying
because of me.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.050
I'm saying
because of you.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.125
You don't want
to do it to her.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.425
I'm sorry.
I'm -- I'm sorry.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.930
(sighs)

01:17.340 --> 01:19.934
YOUNG-HEE: (laughing) So, Don
is at the top of the hill,

01:19.980 --> 01:22.642
and I'm down at the bottom,
the kids are on the sled,

01:22.680 --> 01:26.377
and the snow was like
frozen, thick ice.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.217
And I think, "It's okay.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.309
Even if they come too fast,
I can stop them."

01:30.350 --> 01:32.113
Well, Don let them go,

01:32.160 --> 01:34.879
and they are starting to rush
down the hill.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.729
Whoosh! So fast.
(laughter)

01:36.760 --> 01:39.251
They are coming at me so fast.
They're like a bullet.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.450
And all of sudden, I realize,

01:41.500 --> 01:44.765
"If I jump on them,
I will kill them."

01:44.800 --> 01:46.062
(laughter)

01:46.100 --> 01:47.499
So, what did you do?

01:47.540 --> 01:49.030
So, I jump out of the way.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.735
And lucky there was
no cars coming.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.509
But Don, oh!

01:54.540 --> 01:57.407
He said
a funny, funny thing.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.439
You remember it?

01:58.480 --> 01:59.970
No.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.614
Oh, sure you do.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.743
1--

02:04.790 --> 02:06.678
I have to do some work.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.649
Well, he said,

02:15.700 --> 02:18.965
"Well, at least we know
you have the good reflexes."

02:19.000 --> 02:21.059
(laughter)

02:26.640 --> 02:27.538
PHILIP: Bouillon?

02:27.580 --> 02:28.604
That's right.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.369
Flavors the noodles.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.857
Was your mom a good cook?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.748
She made a soup I liked.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.369
You told me your dad died
when you were six.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.774
He's on his Walkman.

03:05.350 --> 03:08.547
What did he do?
For work?

03:15.290 --> 03:20.318
I come from a city
called Tobolsk in Siberia.

03:20.360 --> 03:24.364
It's surrounded by forest,
and he was a logger.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.534
Did you like it there?

03:33.710 --> 03:34.938
(chuckles)

03:34.980 --> 03:37.005
I don't know.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.608
We didn't think that way.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.914
There were things there
that I liked.

03:40.950 --> 03:43.510
But my dad worked
very hard.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.189
And when he came home,
he was...

03:46.220 --> 03:50.088
tired.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.621
My mom -- She was...

03:52.660 --> 03:54.298
She was very tough.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.924
That's what Mom says
about her mom.

03:58.970 --> 04:02.269
Well, that's the way
you had to be.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.700
After the war,
people didn't have much.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.605
It wasn't about
what you liked.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.871
It was about hard work
and protecting your family.

04:10.910 --> 04:13.470
I had a job after school

04:13.520 --> 04:16.318
at this thing we called
a cooperative.

04:16.350 --> 04:18.318
We made rakes.

04:21.090 --> 04:23.650
One week, the guy who ran
the place, he got greedy,

04:23.690 --> 04:27.251
and he tried to pay me
half of what he owed me.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.364
My mom went over there.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.333
And then
he paid me all of it.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.340
**

05:24.390 --> 05:26.278
37 points.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.810
(sighs)

05:27.860 --> 05:30.988
She's a librarian.
Mid-40$.

05:31.030 --> 05:34.193
You_wouldn't even notice her
If she sat on your lap.

05:34.230 --> 05:35.857
How'd you find her?

05:35.900 --> 05:38.494
I saw "The Militant"
hanging out of her bag

05:38.530 --> 05:40.134
when I was checking out
my book.

05:40.170 --> 05:43.298
She and the older man,
plus Hans,

05:46.210 --> 05:48.178
Tea?
-Yeah.

05:48.210 --> 05:49.700
-Elizabeth?
-No, thanks.

05:52.550 --> 05:54.677
And is William ready?

05:54.720 --> 05:57.814
He's been monitoring
the shift changes at the lab.

05:57.850 --> 06:00.978
He thinks he'll be ready
at best in a few days.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.351
At worst, a few weeks.

06:02.390 --> 06:04.620
How close are you
to getting the codes?

06:06.530 --> 06:08.020
Close.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.722
How close?

06:10.770 --> 06:12.067
Let's talk through this
for a second.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.068
Maybe she's not ready
to do this.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.237
It's okay.

06:15.270 --> 06:17.158
Um...

06:17.210 --> 06:18.859
Maybe days.

06:18.910 --> 06:23.006
Last time, we did nearly
start an epidemic.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.506
Oh, you think I forgot?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.439
It's supposed to be
10 times worse.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.938
The_ best deterrent
IS strength.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.754
Even their president
says that.

06:33.790 --> 06:36.588
(sighs)

06:42.670 --> 06:46.299
Okay, so 6:30, then.

06:46.330 --> 06:49.629
I'm glad it worked out.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.399
I'll see you then.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.328
Okay.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.278
WOLFE: Agent Aderholt.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.311
Check your margins,
please.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.787
(door closes)
Welcome to Munchkinland.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.993
IfI knew
it would be like this,

07:14.030 --> 07:15.725
I would have retired
with Gaad.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.318
(chuckles)

07:19.170 --> 07:20.762
Hey, you got plans
tomorrow night?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.062
Not really.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.408
You want to grab a drink?

07:23.440 --> 07:24.998
-Okay.
-Great.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.405
There will be three of us.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.907
You, me, and Martha's dad.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.101
Oh, come on, Stan.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.469
It's a favor.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.614
He's in town.
I said I'd grab a drink.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.110
Come on.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.915
There's_a word for what
you Just did, Stan.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.359
Entrapment.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.188
-Where are you going?
-I have a test.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.707
Without clearing your plate?

07:56.740 --> 07:58.469
I'm behind.

07:58.510 --> 08:00.933
That's what you get for
being better at school.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.800
When you're done with the
dishes, mop the floor, Paige.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.999
(doorbell rings)
Ha ha.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.199
Probably Stan.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.945
Uh, tell him
there's no leftovers.

08:06.980 --> 08:10.188
Henry, if that plate
is not clear by morning,

08:10.220 --> 08:12.017
you're eating off of it
for breakfast!

08:12.050 --> 08:14.280
HENRY:
Good! More flavor!

08:14.320 --> 08:16.823
Alice.
What a surprise.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.827
Yeah, of -- of course.

08:20.860 --> 08:23.988
Is everything okay?

08:31.510 --> 08:33.876
Tim is missing in Ethiopia.

08:33.910 --> 08:35.639
-What?!
-Oh, my God.

08:35.680 --> 08:40.470
He and Allen Woods decided to go
to another village on their own.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.873
And they never came back.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.241
Do they know
where the village is?

08:44.290 --> 08:46.383
Near the Eritrean border.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.658
If you have anything
to do with this...

08:51.690 --> 08:53.555
-What?
-Alice.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.897
I don't want to hear
your stories!

08:54.930 --> 08:56.727
Alice, what are you
talking about?

08:56.770 --> 08:59.193
Tim wants to believe the best
In everyone,

08:59.230 --> 09:00.868
but I know what you do,

09:00.900 --> 09:03.664
and I know that you have people
all over the world.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.008
Would you please
lower your voice?

09:06.040 --> 09:08.531
Henry is --
-No. I don't care!

09:08.580 --> 09:09.604
Alice, this is crazy.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.947
-Is it?
-Yes.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.845
Ethiopia's a --
a dangerous country.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.075
Everybody knows that.
Anything could have happened.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.509
Well,
I called the embassy for help,

09:17.550 --> 09:19.689
and they told me to
call the State Department,

09:19.720 --> 09:21.756
and they told me that Ethiopia

09:21.790 --> 09:23.724
is a client state
of the USSR.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.456
And there are Soviet troops
everywhere.

09:26.490 --> 09:28.799
-You cannot think that we --
-I don't want to hear it!

09:28.830 --> 09:32.220
I know how the world works.

09:32.270 --> 09:33.794
I made a tape.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.809
I gave it to a lavwer.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.035
It's addressed to
the Justice Department.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.628
It says exactly who you are.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.739
-Alice, please.
-I'm sorry, Paige.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.577
I know that you have
nothing to do with this,

09:47.820 --> 09:51.210
If Tim doesn't come home
or if anything happens to me,

09:51.250 --> 09:54.754
that tape goes to
the Justice Department.

09:54.790 --> 09:57.452
That's all I want to say.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.151
Alice. Alice!

10:16.540 --> 10:18.644
(Tatiana moaning)

10:35.800 --> 10:37.495
Shh.

10:37.530 --> 10:40.169
(laughs)

10:47.310 --> 10:50.746
(moaning resumes)

10:59.420 --> 11:00.751
(laughs)

11:24.780 --> 11:26.771
(both laugh)

13:54.330 --> 13:56.525
His door was closed.
He heard yelling,

13:56.560 --> 13:58.699
but he couldn't understand
what we were saying.

13:58.730 --> 14:04.407
_ I told_him that Pastor Tim
IS missmg and Alice IS upset.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.408
ELIZABETH:
Well, it's awful.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.907
I feel awful for her.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.874
Well, of course.
With the baby coming...

14:14.280 --> 14:17.386
What?

14:17.420 --> 14:19.888
Nothing.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.054
Nothing. I-I just...

14:29.530 --> 14:31.225
I mean...

14:31.270 --> 14:33.397
Is there any way...?

14:33.440 --> 14:36.193
-Paige.
-Let her finish.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.730
"Is there any way" what?

14:37.770 --> 14:40.534
I don't know.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.104
Say what you want to say.

14:42.140 --> 14:46.201
Alice is scared,
and it's understandable.

14:46.250 --> 14:50.186
But it doesn't make sense,
what she's saying.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.040
"Is there any way" what?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.449
I don't know, okay?
I just...

14:56.490 --> 14:59.027
I mean, I don't know
what kind of people

14:59.060 --> 15:00.789
the Russians have
In Africa.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.752
I-I just...

15:02.800 --> 15:05.394
I wonder, okay?
I don't know.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.762
(sighs)

15:12.570 --> 15:14.970
We don't want this.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.978
This is a disaster for us.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.546
For you?

15:18.580 --> 15:20.946
-No, I meant if you think --
-Look --

15:20.980 --> 15:24.381
This is pretty good for you,
actually. That's the thing.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.479
He goes to Africa all the time.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.488
But now, all of a sudden,

15:28.520 --> 15:30.750
when you're so worried
that he knows your secret,

15:30.790 --> 15:31.927
he disappears?

15:31.960 --> 15:34.428
Paige, that's crazy.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.325
What? Do you think
we kidnap people and what?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.897
That we kill them?
-I don't know. I-I mean,

15:38.930 --> 15:43.833
__ in a Russian-controlled
military country, he disappears?

15:43.870 --> 15:46.236
That doesn't sound
that crazy to me.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.806
Well, it's not true.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.728
But how am I
supposed to know?

15:49.780 --> 15:52.908
I mean, even if it were,
that's what you'd say, right?

15:52.950 --> 15:55.168
You'd have to.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.313
I mean,
she comes in here and...

15:57.350 --> 15:59.011
I don't know.
How would I know?

15:59.050 --> 16:01.359
Tell me._ How would I know?
-Paige, listen to us.

16:01.390 --> 16:03.085
We couldn't have made this
happen even if we wanted to.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.119
Paige!

16:04.160 --> 16:05.889
Paige. Wait!

16:11.530 --> 16:13.964
(sighs)

16:15.970 --> 16:18.302
Is there any way?

16:18.340 --> 16:19.204
No.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.379
Not without telling us.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.947
(sighs)
I just can't believe it.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.868
After we bent over backwards
not to do it...

16:25.910 --> 16:27.639
So she wouldn't hate us.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.874
(sighs)

16:28.920 --> 16:30.319
And does she really think

16:30.350 --> 16:32.318
we'd be so stupid
that we'd leave Alice?

16:32.350 --> 16:34.011
Unless they have
something planned.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.551
Stop.
You're worse than she is.

16:36.590 --> 16:38.524
(sighs)

16:38.560 --> 16:41.154
I'm sure we have a lot of people
in Ethiopia.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.464
We'll have Gabriel see
what they can do.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.229
If he's alive.

16:45.270 --> 16:50.503
At least it's something
to offer Alice.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.470
Now I'm thinking
we may have to run.

16:56.510 --> 16:59.741
(sighs)

17:02.080 --> 17:05.117
Ithought
I could live like this.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.859
(indistinct conversations)

17:34.920 --> 17:38.048
(indistinct conversations)

17:38.090 --> 17:40.081
Yes, I'll hold.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.778
Paige.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.253
They found the Jeep,
but no one was in it.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.519
(sighs)

17:50.570 --> 17:52.060
Is Alice here?

17:52.100 --> 17:55.399
She's in with Mrs. Woods
and Assistant Pastor Dale.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.408
I -- I'll just come back
after school.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.260
Okay.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.005
I promise I'll call
if we hear anything. Okay.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.327
Oh, God.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.792
(sighs)

18:32.510 --> 18:34.603
Ohh.

18:40.850 --> 18:42.078
Do you want to sit?

18:42.120 --> 18:45.112
Oh, it doesn't
make a difference.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.654
Alice,
I just want to say

18:50.690 --> 18:53.750
I love you and Pastor Tim
so much.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.360
I know, sweetheart.

19:06.570 --> 19:08.299
(sobs)

19:12.650 --> 19:15.972
You've done
so much for me.

19:20.690 --> 19:23.625
(voice breaking)
I'm just so scared.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.855
(sobs)

19:30.900 --> 19:32.993
(sobbing)

19:49.550 --> 19:53.850
You remember that flood
in Kansas in the early '505?

19:53.890 --> 19:55.152
I think so.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.988
Martha was
in the first grade.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.498
She raised $50
to send to the families.

20:00.530 --> 20:03.761
That's the kind of person
Martha is.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.722
I just... (sighs)

20:05.770 --> 20:07.237
I find it hard
to understand.

20:07.270 --> 20:08.737
You haven't
heard anything yet?

20:08.770 --> 20:12.661
Uh, typically we don't
in cases like this.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.598
But the KGB?

20:14.640 --> 20:16.073
_ _ Isn't that _
jumping to conclu5ions?

20:16.110 --> 20:18.408
I mean, he could be
any kind of con man.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.418
People disappear
for all sorts of reasons.

20:20.450 --> 20:23.385
She could be drugged or --
or kidnapped.

20:23.420 --> 20:26.389
Based on the evidence,
we're --

20:26.420 --> 20:28.388
You're acting like
she's the criminal.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.559
She's not.

20:30.590 --> 20:34.549
It's this Clark
or whatever his real name is.

20:34.600 --> 20:39.799
Martha is the most honest,
loyal, kind person in the world.

20:39.830 --> 20:43.095
Mr. Hanson,
that's just the thing.

20:43.140 --> 20:47.065
It's_often that
understanding, decent person

20:47.110 --> 20:50.102
who's susceptible to
these kinds of manipulations.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.573
Yeah, but not Martha.

20:51.610 --> 20:53.202
She's too smart for that.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.287
You guys have to do everything
in your power to get her back.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.652
You'll see I'm right.

21:01.690 --> 21:03.658
Just promise me this.

21:03.690 --> 21:06.523
Promise _me
you won't give up.

21:11.530 --> 21:13.225
It's an ongoing investigation.

21:13.270 --> 21:19.459
I assure you,
no one's giving up.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.942
(thumping)

21:40.500 --> 21:42.627
I checked the tape.
It's mostly nothing.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.161
He's in Ethiopia.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.963
Then Alice calls_ about
where he is,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.695
but there's nothing
to a lawyer.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.664
(thumping continues)

21:50.710 --> 21:52.769
Do you think that bothers
the neighbors?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.471
-Does it bother you?
-Yes.

21:54.510 --> 21:57.172
He could break
the garage door.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.973
It's just a tennis ball.

21:59.010 --> 22:00.102
(door opens)

22:00.150 --> 22:02.175
(thumping continues)

22:22.170 --> 22:24.138
Couldn't he break
the garage door?

22:24.170 --> 22:25.967
Yes.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.638
Did you see Alice today?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.545
(sighs)

22:34.250 --> 22:36.241
And?

22:40.020 --> 22:42.386
We prayed.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.524
Paige, we talked with some of
the people we work with.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.427
We have colleagues
in Ethiopia.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.721
And they're gonna
talk to them

22:51.770 --> 22:53.533
and see if they can
help find him.

22:53.570 --> 22:56.494
Who knows what happened,

22:56.540 --> 22:58.201
but if there's any chance,

22:58.240 --> 23:01.403
you should let her know that
we're doing everything we can.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.873
Yeah.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.904
What if she sends the tape?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.212
We might have to leave.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.222
You and Dad?

23:19.260 --> 23:21.228
All of us.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.866
Where?

23:24.900 --> 23:26.265
(thumping continues)

23:28.270 --> 23:30.738
Wait.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.101
Are you serious?

23:32.140 --> 23:34.631
We're not there yet.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.079
Are you serious?!

23:36.110 --> 23:37.771
-Paige.
-Paige.

23:37.810 --> 23:38.970
Henry, too?

23:39.010 --> 23:41.240
We couldn't
leave him behind.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.077
-If we can keep Alice calm --
-No, no, no, no. Stop.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.212
-No, it's true. If we can --
-St-Stop! Stop!

23:44.250 --> 23:46.218
Paige,
you need to calm down.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.979
No, I don't!
I don't need to do anything!

23:48.020 --> 23:49.612
Are you serious?
Do you hear yourselves?

23:49.660 --> 23:50.979
Listen. If you would just listen
to what we're saying.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.657
-I don't want to listen!
-If we can keep --

23:52.690 --> 23:54.920
Everything you say
is crazy!

23:54.960 --> 23:57.121
Go back to Russia?

23:57.160 --> 23:58.889
I've never been to Russia.

23:58.930 --> 24:01.933
What, are we gonna
speak Russian?

24:01.970 --> 24:03.164
What are you gonna
do there?

24:03.200 --> 24:05.339
You can't be Russian spies
in Russia!

24:05.370 --> 24:07.065
Then where are we gonna go?
What country?

24:07.110 --> 24:08.577
Who are you gonna lie to?

24:08.610 --> 24:10.077
Who are you gonna
make disappear?

24:10.110 --> 24:11.304
Paige!

24:14.720 --> 24:17.746
We have nothing
to do with this.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.280
(thumping continues)

24:35.200 --> 24:36.633
I'm going.

24:36.670 --> 24:37.932
Okay, sweetheart.

24:37.970 --> 24:40.871
It's on
the northwest corner.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.377
I know.

24:42.410 --> 24:44.446
If I'm not there,
I'll be in the shops next door.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.606
I'll see you
in half an hour.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.776
Okay.

24:46.810 --> 24:49.711
Don't buy me anything.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.987
Ah.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.166
(door opens)

25:12.210 --> 25:13.677
What's the matter?
You forget some--

25:13.710 --> 25:14.870
(Russian accent)
Frank Gaad.

25:16.610 --> 25:18.703
(door closes)

25:18.750 --> 25:21.310
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Gaad.

25:21.350 --> 25:25.081
We're not here to hurt you.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.486
We have a proposal for you.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.909
Get out of my room.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.020
Please.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.392
You should listen to us.

25:35.430 --> 25:38.524
And if I don't want to
listen to you?

25:43.540 --> 25:45.064
I think
you'll be making a mistake.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.571
(speaking Russian)

25:47.610 --> 25:48.736
Ohh!

25:51.710 --> 25:54.270
(breathing heavily)

26:16.600 --> 26:19.068
(breathing slows)

26:34.960 --> 26:37.258
(breathing stops)

27:02.350 --> 27:04.147
(door closes)

27:13.860 --> 27:17.318
**

27:18.830 --> 27:21.298
(owl hooting)

27:21.340 --> 27:24.332
**

28:13.020 --> 28:14.715
What'd I miss?

28:14.760 --> 28:16.409
An owl.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.428
You saw it?

28:18.460 --> 28:21.827
I'm not sure,
but it made an owl sound.

28:21.860 --> 28:25.227
H00! H00! H00!

28:25.270 --> 28:26.919
And then it flew off.

28:26.970 --> 28:29.188
(laughs)

28:29.240 --> 28:31.435
Okay.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.146
You've got the best pot,
James.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.573
You're like a...

28:45.550 --> 28:48.451
...I don't know.
Like a...

28:48.490 --> 28:49.787
Pot connoisseur?

28:49.820 --> 28:52.459
Yes! Yes.

28:59.730 --> 29:02.733
How are things with, um...

29:02.770 --> 29:03.930
What's his name?

29:03.970 --> 29:06.302
His name's Pete.

29:06.340 --> 29:07.637
Pete.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.069
Like you don't know.

29:09.110 --> 29:11.203
Mm.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.639
Things are okay.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.216
What's wrong?

29:15.250 --> 29:17.980
Nothing. It's okay.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.988
"Okay" means "not okay."

29:21.920 --> 29:25.378
He's...young.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.455
Mm.

29:27.490 --> 29:29.799
I mean, he's my age,
but he's...

29:29.830 --> 29:32.492
-Young.
-Yeah.

29:32.530 --> 29:35.237
Plenty more fish
in the sea.

29:35.270 --> 29:37.636
Like you would know.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.729
(chuckles)

29:39.770 --> 29:44.844
Mm. High school
is pretty much fished out.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.542
You want to know
something?

29:56.390 --> 29:58.324
Sure.

30:00.460 --> 30:02.018
It's a secret.

30:02.060 --> 30:03.027
(chuckles)

30:09.670 --> 30:13.367
Dad doesn't work
at the State Department.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.273
He took another job?

30:17.310 --> 30:18.447
No.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.698
He never worked there.

30:20.750 --> 30:23.071
He works for the CIA.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.852
Do you believe that?

30:27.890 --> 30:31.883
I don't -- I don't --

30:31.930 --> 30:33.625
I don't know.
How do you know?

30:33.660 --> 30:35.628
He told me.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.992
Wow.

30:38.030 --> 30:40.897
Yeah. It's like...

30:40.940 --> 30:45.161
Everything in my life
makes sense suddenly.

30:45.210 --> 30:49.670
His travel,
the way he is around the house.

30:49.710 --> 30:52.247
Like,
not here when he's here.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.410
(sighs)

30:59.850 --> 31:02.159
Have you told anyone?

31:02.190 --> 31:03.885
You.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.158
Tell Pete?

31:05.190 --> 31:07.420
(scoffs)
Are you kidding?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.392
What?

31:17.540 --> 31:19.804
I don't think
you should've told me.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.733
-Why?
-Because it's a secret,

31:23.780 --> 31:27.568
and telling it
breaks your father's trust.

31:27.610 --> 31:31.740
It could bring you and your dad
closer together,

31:31.790 --> 31:33.815
but only if you keep it.

31:49.840 --> 31:50.966
Hey.

31:51.010 --> 31:51.965
Hi.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.568
Is Henry here?

31:53.610 --> 31:54.929
Uh, no.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.971
Oh. Um...

31:57.010 --> 31:59.376
I guess he went to Doug's.

31:59.410 --> 32:00.445
All right, well, thanks.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.812
Wait. Um...

32:02.850 --> 32:04.078
Do you want to hang out?

32:04.120 --> 32:07.783
My dad's working
this weekend.

32:07.820 --> 32:11.586
I'm just here, so...

32:13.090 --> 32:16.218
Uh...sure.

32:16.260 --> 32:20.026
But just for a little.
I have to stop by my church.

32:30.110 --> 32:33.739
Uh, can I get you a soda
or something?

32:33.780 --> 32:36.442
Actually,
do you have coffee?

32:36.480 --> 32:39.040
Sure, big shot. Yeah.

32:46.660 --> 32:51.324
So, you guys aren't big
on interior decorating.

32:51.370 --> 32:55.238
What? Are you crazy?
That's all we talk about.

33:07.580 --> 33:11.038
Do you think it's cool
that he's an FBI agent?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.614
Or weird?

33:12.650 --> 33:16.711
Uh, for me, he, like,
never really talked about it,

33:16.760 --> 33:18.387
so it was weird.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.955
But, uh, now that
I'm around more,

33:20.990 --> 33:23.026
he's chatty about everything,
so...

33:23.060 --> 33:25.790
Well, that's good.

33:25.830 --> 33:27.718
Yeah, I think
he's trying to show me

33:27.770 --> 33:30.762
he's, uh, glad I'm here
or something.

33:32.670 --> 33:35.673
Yesterday he told me
he went out with this guy

33:35.710 --> 33:39.441
who was the dad of the secretary
in his office who was a spy.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.145
W-What do you mean?

33:44.190 --> 33:46.317
His secretary was --
was a spy?

33:46.350 --> 33:48.181
No, not his secretary.

33:48.220 --> 33:49.949
He's just investigating it.

33:52.390 --> 33:54.051
Wow.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.728
Yeah.
Uh, she just disappeared.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.591
And the father's
really broken up.

33:58.630 --> 34:00.598
You know, it's intense,
you know?

34:06.310 --> 34:08.403
So, uh,
tell me about church.

34:08.440 --> 34:12.149
Oh, it's, um,
it's the Reed Street Church.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.209
Do you go somewhere?

34:16.250 --> 34:19.185
No. Uh,
we're not really religious.

34:19.220 --> 34:22.678
My parents aren't,
either.

34:22.720 --> 34:26.224
I got involved
'cause of the youth group.

34:26.260 --> 34:29.593
It's really cool.

34:29.630 --> 34:34.567
But there's this --

34:34.600 --> 34:37.569
this horrible thing
happening now.

34:42.410 --> 34:44.970
Our pastor is missing.

34:45.010 --> 34:47.069
What?

34:47.110 --> 34:52.912
He's on a famine relief trip
to Ethiopia,

34:52.950 --> 34:58.229
and he just disappeared.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.057
Oh, my God.

35:00.090 --> 35:02.092
Yeah, it's really bad.

35:02.130 --> 35:04.724
I'm pretty close
with him and his wife,

35:04.770 --> 35:07.921
so I've been -- I've been
checking on her every day.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.009
Uh, do you want sugar
or anything?

35:17.040 --> 35:19.474
Oh, no, just the --
just the caffeine is great.

35:19.510 --> 35:21.649
I haven't really been
sleeping much.

35:23.780 --> 35:28.353
Actually,
I-I should get to the church.

35:28.390 --> 35:30.187
(sighs)

35:30.220 --> 35:32.188
Uh, what?

35:33.630 --> 35:36.019
I just --
I still have my permit,

35:36.060 --> 35:38.369
so I have to ask my parents
for a ride.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.924
No, H can drive you.

35:39.970 --> 35:41.494
Really?

35:41.540 --> 35:43.189
Yeah,
I have my mom's car.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.333
Are you sure?

35:45.370 --> 35:47.964
Yes. I'll just go get the keys.
I'll be right back.

35:51.810 --> 35:53.869
(indistinct conversations)

35:55.080 --> 35:57.378
There's Paige.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.047
-Be right back.
-Okay.

35:59.090 --> 36:02.287
Paige,
you won't believe it.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.810
They're okay.

36:03.860 --> 36:04.986
What?

36:05.030 --> 36:07.157
They ran out of gas.

36:07.190 --> 36:09.397
They tried to walk, and they got
lost. But they're fine.

36:09.430 --> 36:12.160
Oh, my God. Tha--

36:12.200 --> 36:14.498
That's great.
Th-That's really great.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.564
God is good.

36:21.210 --> 36:23.007
(sighs)

36:24.710 --> 36:26.302
Oh, um...

36:26.350 --> 36:28.671
This is my friend Matthew.
Matthew, this is Zach.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.574
-Hey, Matthew.
-Hey.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.688
Uh, Matthew actually
plays guitar, too.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.349
-Really?
-Yeah, well, a little bit.

36:38.390 --> 36:41.598
Um, I just -- I have to go
check on the pastor's wife.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.325
I'll be right back, okay?
-Yeah, of course.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.089
Maybe you can tell him about
youth choir.

36:45.130 --> 36:46.097
Sure.

36:53.570 --> 36:55.504
ALICE: Paige.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.098
Hi.

36:57.140 --> 36:59.108
Come on.
Come back.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.347
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

37:05.390 --> 37:06.880
Thank you.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.221
(sobs)

37:16.460 --> 37:17.950
You never
saw me cry before.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.695
Now it's all I do.

37:19.730 --> 37:21.937
It's okay.

37:21.970 --> 37:23.597
I'm so relieved.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.859
Me, too. Ifeel like
I can breathe again.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.730
(exhales deeply)

37:28.780 --> 37:30.634
(sniffles)

37:30.680 --> 37:32.375
When's he coming back?

37:32.410 --> 37:33.399
Tomorrow.

37:33.450 --> 37:34.747
Oh, thank God.

37:34.780 --> 37:37.977
I know.
I know. It's a miracle.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.718
This baby must be thinking,
"What is going on out there?"

37:42.760 --> 37:44.182
(both laugh)

37:51.200 --> 37:54.397
Paige, honey.

37:54.440 --> 37:57.568
I've never been
scared like that before.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.103
I mean... _ _
I'm married to a minister.

38:00.140 --> 38:02.005
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.647
Please tell your parents
I'm sorry.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.442
It's -- It's okay.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.287
They understand.

38:18.460 --> 38:19.859
Are you hungry?

38:19.890 --> 38:22.324
Everybody brought food.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.828
There's so much,
I don't know what to do with it.

38:27.070 --> 38:29.994
JOAN:
This is a message for Patty.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.009
YOUNG-HEE: Hi, Patty.
It's Young-Hee.

38:33.040 --> 38:37.534
What we talked about,
it's getting worse.

38:37.580 --> 38:40.299
His behavior --

38:40.350 --> 38:41.942
He's...

38:41.980 --> 38:43.470
(sighs)

38:43.520 --> 38:47.809
I don't know,
but something is wrong.

38:47.850 --> 38:51.627
(voice breaking)
Patty, I don't know what.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.787
(sniffles)

38:53.830 --> 38:55.525
I'm sorry.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.620
Please just call.

38:58.670 --> 39:03.130
I really want to talk.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.206
(click)

39:16.450 --> 39:18.418
He got lost.
They ran out of gas.

39:18.450 --> 39:20.589
Where? What happened?

39:20.620 --> 39:22.087
They were trying to find
their way back the whole time,

39:22.120 --> 39:24.156
and then
they just showed up.

39:24.190 --> 39:26.658
He and Allen Woods
were walking for days.

39:26.690 --> 39:27.987
-Thank God.
-Yeah.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.590
I know.

39:30.630 --> 39:34.168
Alice feels really bad
about what she said.

39:34.200 --> 39:38.091
And I feel really bad
about what I said, too.

39:44.140 --> 39:46.404
It was just --
It was so weird.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.684
Listen, Paige.

39:56.720 --> 40:00.429
The hardest thing we do
in our jobs

40:00.460 --> 40:02.951
is trust.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.763
We never know for sure

40:04.800 --> 40:07.667
if other people
are telling us the truth.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.905
But the one thing
Dad and I have

40:11.940 --> 40:13.828
is we tell each other
the truth.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.772
And now that we told you
about us,

40:19.810 --> 40:21.277
you're part of that.

40:24.180 --> 40:28.788
We can't always tell you
every detail about our job.

40:28.820 --> 40:32.449
But we will tell you
what we can.

40:32.490 --> 40:34.993
And we won't lie to you.

40:40.530 --> 40:43.738
I don't think we should ask
Alice for the tape right now.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.306
You don't?

40:45.340 --> 40:48.434
I was going to, but...

40:48.480 --> 40:49.629
She didn't bring it up,

40:49.680 --> 40:51.602
and it felt weird

40:51.650 --> 40:54.005
with us just finding out
about Pastor Tim.

40:54.050 --> 40:56.575
I didn't want her
to think that...

40:56.620 --> 40:58.781
Yeah.

40:58.820 --> 41:02.017
I just felt
it would be better to wait.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.449
I think
that sounds smart.

41:04.490 --> 41:07.618
Yeah. Great.

41:07.660 --> 41:10.595
(sighs)

41:10.630 --> 41:13.292
When are you gonna
tell Henry?

41:17.670 --> 41:21.401
I mean, you are gonna tell him
at some point, right?

41:24.980 --> 41:28.518
A lot of that
depends on Henry.

41:41.390 --> 41:42.391
(knock on door)

41:42.430 --> 41:43.419
(Russian) Yes?

41:47.270 --> 41:49.534
(Russian) Thank you.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.407
(door closes)

42:25.110 --> 42:27.260
(printer whirring,
telephone rings)

42:44.890 --> 42:48.189
Look, Stan,
I just heard some news.

42:48.230 --> 42:50.095
There's gonna be
an announcement,

42:50.130 --> 42:52.997
and I don't know any details,
but...

42:55.000 --> 42:56.228
Gaad is dead.

42:58.470 --> 42:59.869
The D.A.G. was down.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.299
I overheard him
telling Wolfe.

43:04.140 --> 43:06.108
Like, a-a heart attack?

43:06.150 --> 43:07.902
I don't know.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.513
On his trip?

43:14.420 --> 43:16.285
I-I just
don't know anything.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.481
(knock on door)

43:26.670 --> 43:27.967
All hands on deck.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.831
Wolfe's got
an announcement to make.

43:45.690 --> 43:48.079
GABRIEL: We did have people
looking for him.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.280
Mm.

43:57.660 --> 44:01.528
Sometimes the best move
in this business

44:01.570 --> 44:03.788
is having
a little bit of luck.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.205
(chuckles)

44:05.240 --> 44:07.606
This guy's wandering around,
no idea where he is.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.130
(chuckles)

44:09.180 --> 44:10.932
Trying to feed people, though,
I'll give him that.

44:10.980 --> 44:12.379
A good Christian.

44:12.410 --> 44:14.605
(chuckles)

44:14.650 --> 44:17.175
Are you ready to move
to get the codes?

44:17.220 --> 44:21.213
Yeah, I think so.

44:21.250 --> 44:23.150
You think so?

44:24.990 --> 44:27.185
Yes. I am.

44:28.700 --> 44:31.555
What's the problem?

44:35.870 --> 44:37.337
Nothing.

44:37.370 --> 44:38.906
There's no problem.

44:43.710 --> 44:49.239
You know, it's possible
for people like us

44:49.280 --> 44:53.819
who give everything
to our country and the world

44:53.850 --> 44:56.683
to forget ourselves.

44:56.720 --> 44:59.359
You sound like Philip
after an EST meeting.

45:02.130 --> 45:04.519
What are they like?
The family?

45:14.270 --> 45:16.704
They're close.

45:18.750 --> 45:20.741
And loud.

45:20.780 --> 45:22.748
Big.

45:22.780 --> 45:24.941
You'd like them.

45:24.990 --> 45:27.709
Well, you like them.

45:29.460 --> 45:31.087
I suppose I do.

45:34.090 --> 45:36.627
It's okay.

45:39.830 --> 45:43.391
What _if we couldn't
get in this way?

45:43.440 --> 45:45.806
You've already done
the hard part.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.705
(sighs) No.

45:47.740 --> 45:49.605
The next part
is the hard part.

45:49.640 --> 45:52.245
After that,
they'll never recover.

45:52.280 --> 45:55.579
Elizabeth.

45:55.620 --> 45:57.713
Your feelings matter.

45:57.750 --> 45:58.887
No, they don't.

45:58.920 --> 46:01.741
Or they shouldn't.

46:01.790 --> 46:04.350
They can sometimes.

46:06.990 --> 46:08.582
Let's ask.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.134
How about this?

46:17.170 --> 46:18.967
Before we take
the last step,

46:19.010 --> 46:21.638
I'll ask them to look for
another way in.

46:21.670 --> 46:23.331
There's no harm in asking.

46:23.380 --> 46:26.508
We don't know
everything they know.

46:28.480 --> 46:32.348
Do you want me to ask?

46:47.200 --> 46:49.168
Yes.

46:59.010 --> 47:01.808
**

47:43.290 --> 47:45.520
(silenced gunshots)
ANNOUNCER: The Americans.

-Thursdays.
-Why the hell are you naked?

47:51.530 --> 47:54.590
It's after Labor Day!

47:54.630 --> 47:58.930

48:31.140 --> 48:32.630
* Yeah
