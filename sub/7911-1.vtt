00:40.831 --> 00:42.166
On the count of three.

00:42.416 --> 00:46.170
One, two, three!

00:47.839 --> 00:50.758
Try the ring toss. Three for a quarter.
Look how easy it is.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.261
There you go, a winner!

00:53.302 --> 00:57.098
And now, for my shocking finale.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.684
Not for the squeamish.

00:59.809 --> 01:03.104
Not for the faint of heart.

01:03.855 --> 01:08.150
I call my trick "The Jaws of Death. "

01:10.111 --> 01:12.613
Now. Say it. Say it.

01:12.738 --> 01:16.367
Harold, use your awesome might
to save me from this hopeless plight.

01:16.617 --> 01:19.078
No harm will come to you.
Alakazam!

01:26.460 --> 01:28.296
Help me! Help me!

01:41.184 --> 01:42.894
I'm going to be an actress.

03:34.755 --> 03:36.757
Hard to believe it was last Christmas...

03:36.841 --> 03:38.843
...that me and Harmony
changed the world.

03:38.926 --> 03:42.763
And we didn't mean to.
And it didn't last long, you know.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.223
A thing like that can't.

03:44.432 --> 03:48.144
Now that I'm in L.A., I go to parties.
The kind where if a girl is named Jill...

03:48.436 --> 03:50.938
...she spells it J-Y-L-L-E, that bullshit.

03:51.522 --> 03:55.818
That's me there. My name's
Harry Lockhart, I'll be your narrator.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.361
Welcome to L.A.

03:57.486 --> 03:58.821
Welcome to the party.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.130
The guy smoking, that's Dabney Shaw,
my producer. He discovered me.

04:16.255 --> 04:20.384
The man with him is Perry Van Shrike,
a.k.a. Gay Perry.

04:20.635 --> 04:24.180
Honest-to-God private eye,
consults in film, TV. Just incorporated.

04:24.388 --> 04:26.807
He's bigtime. Also, he's gay.

04:26.974 --> 04:28.184
Don't start, Perry, huh?

04:28.434 --> 04:31.479
I seen you play ball. You're tough.
But you see a naked guy...

04:31.687 --> 04:33.231
...your brain says, "I want that. "

04:33.481 --> 04:36.776
I don't make that leap. It's like,
"Look, there's an elephant. Quick...

04:36.943 --> 04:39.820
...let's drain its blood
to paint my boathouse. "

04:39.987 --> 04:42.949
It's just that that's not the first thing
you think of.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.784
L.A.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.954
By now you may wonder
how I wound up here, or maybe not.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.165
Maybe you wonder how Silly Putty
picks shit up from comic books.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.418
Point is, I don't see another
goddamn narrator, so pipe down.

04:54.585 --> 04:57.380
How did I get here? See for yourself.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.014
Chloe, just run the name by me
one more time...

05:07.223 --> 05:09.100
...because I must be
missing something.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.019
I'm going nuts.
I've been through the store three times.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.939
Cyber Agent. C-Y-B-E-
Why don't you ask...

05:15.022 --> 05:17.775
- ... an employee or something?
- No, they're all busy.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.197
"Protocop, protector of man. "
Is that it? Protocop? He protects men.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.534
Uncle Harry, look around.
There are signs.

05:26.701 --> 05:31.539
That show was cancelled two years ago.
Just ask- Wait, are they even open?

05:31.706 --> 05:34.542
Yeah, it's holiday hours. Look-
Get away from the window.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.170
I gotta go, but I'll find this.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.717
- Great.
- Shit, Harry, that shit went wrong!

05:42.800 --> 05:44.802
- Give me the gun!
- No. Give me the bullets!

05:44.969 --> 05:46.971
Freeze!

05:47.471 --> 05:51.184
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- We'll stand here and wait for the police.

05:51.475 --> 05:54.979
Drop the gun. We didn't do anything.
We are not dangerous. Drop the gun.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.149
- Hey, lady, gun is not loaded-
- Richie, no!

05:59.150 --> 06:00.234
Richie!

06:00.735 --> 06:02.069
Shit!

06:07.200 --> 06:09.076
Oh, boy.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.672
Take it easy.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.093
Jesus. Oh, no, no.
We're not ready for you yet, sir.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.263
- Go wait with the others.
- Grace, do me a favor, let's take him.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.098
- He's ready. You're ready?
- Ready?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.642
Okay, come on.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.436
You know the setup?
Got any questions?

06:35.686 --> 06:38.022
He's got no questions.
Look at him. Let's go.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.524
Let's read.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.571
- Where is he? Where's Raphael?
- Where is he?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.031
Where's-?

06:52.453 --> 06:56.207
Beat up on me all night. You want me
to give up my partner, you can go spit.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.963
Quit acting like the good guy,
jerk-off.

07:02.129 --> 07:03.798
You got your partner killed.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.051
He was in over his head,
you knew it.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.303
You may as well
have pulled the trigger.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.138
You killed him!

07:14.350 --> 07:17.979
No, I didn't- I didn't kill him.
He wanted in.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.731
Why-?

07:21.232 --> 07:23.234
Why?!

07:23.401 --> 07:25.736
I didn't want him to come in on it.
He insisted.

07:25.862 --> 07:30.783
I said, "Stay at home. " But he doesn't
listen. He's such a stupid son of a bitch.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.785
I killed him, didn't I?

07:32.994 --> 07:36.998
Oh, fuck, this is my fault. I'm sorry.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.006
Sorry.

07:45.464 --> 07:48.384
Hey, good luck.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.597
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Old school. Method.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.099
- Studio.
- Brando. Put this in the pouch to L.A.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.601
Get Gay Perry on the phone.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.354
Now, get this, they're screen-testing me.
Is that wild?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.566
One minute, I'm boosting Xboxes
in the East Village...

08:03.774 --> 08:05.902
...the next,
I'm sipping champagne in L.A.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.987
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.614
So, what do you do?

08:09.780 --> 08:12.325
I'm retired.
I invented dice when I was a kid.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.913
- How about you?
- I do a little acting.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.335
I'm gonna see who else is here.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.712
Anyway, that's how I got to the party.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.883
Now, Harmony, different story.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.220
Some will tell you she got here
on account of the giant robot.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.888
I'll show you that in a minute.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.099
But for me, robot-schmobot,
she was destined to be here.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.101
Jeez, look at those stems, will you?

08:39.309 --> 08:42.355
Not that that's what constitutes
why she should be here.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.315
Yes, racist. I'm serious.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.069
The other reindeer laughed at him.
Then, out of the blue, they need him.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.154
He's as good as a fog light
or whatever.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.616
You know what, so you tell me,
how is it any different than:

08:53.783 --> 08:56.035
"Don't talk to Reggie, he's black.

08:56.118 --> 08:59.622
Oh, wait, he can play basketball.
Sign him up. "

08:59.872 --> 09:02.291
Rudolph, Reggie.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.963
Harmony Faith Lane was your typical
L.A. girl, she wasn't from there.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.257
She grew up in a burg
in southern Indiana.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.718
"When in doubt, cut up a pig. "
That was the town motto.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.973
Like most soon-to-be-fucked-up girls,
Harmony was wicked smart.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.975
Of course, credit where credit's due...

09:19.100 --> 09:21.769
...she had a terrific mentor.
No, not her.

09:21.978 --> 09:22.937
Him.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.274
"'Go to hell, Jonny Gossamer!'

09:26.357 --> 09:29.193
She poured herself
into a seamless dress.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.821
From the looks of it,
she spilled some. "

09:32.113 --> 09:34.490
Jonny spoke from the pages
of cheap paperbacks...

09:34.699 --> 09:37.785
...and told of a promised land
known as "the Coast"...

09:38.035 --> 09:42.081
...and a magical city
called Los Angeles.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.877
As the years progressed,
she wished he was real.

09:46.085 --> 09:50.631
Wished that he would come to Indiana
to save her little sister, Jenna.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.469
You see, Papa was at her
night after night.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.430
But Jonny never showed.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.766
And then the guy
writing the books died.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.643
Age 16, she split.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.771
Took the bus to L.A.,
the promised land.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.566
She'd get rich and famous
and then help little sis.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.151
Before he died...

10:10.359 --> 10:12.820
...the guy who wrote the books
said Jonny was a joke.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.072
He wrote it for money,
and it was bullshit.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.492
Harmony ignored this. She knew better.
I mean, who the hell was he?

10:19.243 --> 10:20.494
He was just a writer.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.164
And that's how she got
to the same party as me-

10:23.414 --> 10:25.082
Oh, shit. I skipped something.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.960
Damn it. This robot bit.
I made a big deal, then I forgot.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.796
Fuck, bad narrating.
Like my dad telling a joke.

10:31.005 --> 10:34.842
"Oh, wait, back up. I forgot to tell you
the cowboy rode a blue horse. " Fuck.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.721
I don't know if you want to see it now,
but here's the fucking robot stuff.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.181
Can I say "fuck" more?

10:40.389 --> 10:42.892
Now back to Protocop,
starring Jeff Neal.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.294
What the-?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.132
Oh, my God.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.761
Hey!

11:24.809 --> 11:28.354
Sources close to Neal, who has not
worked as an actor in two years...

11:28.563 --> 11:30.648
...say he seemed despondent
earlier tonight...

11:30.857 --> 11:32.817
...during a rerun of Protocop.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.945
The actor, who still retains a costume
he wore on the show...

11:36.153 --> 11:37.655
...allegedly dressed up...

11:37.738 --> 11:41.701
...stumbled down the bike path and
wandered into this Venice Beach house...

11:41.909 --> 11:46.497
...where aspiring actress Harmony Faith
Lane was shocked to discover him.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.917
I'd jog by, "Hi, hello, " you know,
that sort of thing.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.711
- Who's this?
- I feel for the guy.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.213
This city can't get enough
of messing with people.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.675
Like putting a whoopee cushion
on the seat of an electric chair.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.760
- Like that.
- They always do this.

11:59.927 --> 12:03.806
You can never see below the waist.
It's like a Playmate in 1964.

12:04.015 --> 12:07.226
It was always behind the bedpost
or there's a shadow. You never-

12:07.351 --> 12:10.021
What am I telling you for?
Invite her to something.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.065
And there it was. Bingo.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.194
Destiny.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.385
You know what,
you better be her doctor.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.929
Walk away. Don't think, just do it.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.891
What, are you her brother or something?
It's none of your business, man.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.354
- I will fuck you up.
- No, you'll try.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.274
And that little experiment
will end in tears, my friend.

13:36.524 --> 13:40.570
So again, for the cheap seats,
do not think, walk the fuck away.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.822
Or let's you and me
go outside right now.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.449
It's past my bedtime.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.660
Make a choice.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.469
Asshole.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.100
You all right?

14:11.976 --> 14:13.728
Yeah.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.479
Thanks, bro.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.940
One day,
I'll actually learn how to fight.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.484
- Perry Van Shrike.
- Hey. Harry Lockhart.

14:21.819 --> 14:25.781
I heard about you. You're
the whatchamacallit, the consultant.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.243
- You must be- Anyway...
- Gay Perry?

14:29.493 --> 14:32.497
Yeah. Right.
Dabney calls you that.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.082
- I guess you guys are old buddies.
- Five years.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.418
Wow, five years.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.086
- Still gay?
- Me? No.

14:39.170 --> 14:43.966
I'm knee-deep in pussy. I just like the
name so much, I can't get rid of it.

14:44.675 --> 14:49.096
You should know better than to fall
asleep at a party. There's freaks here.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.559
Dabney wants you
to take detective lessons.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.354
- Come again?
- For your acting.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.439
I've got surveillance tomorrow.
You game?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.358
What's the person like? Crime lord?

15:00.525 --> 15:03.694
Please. I'm guessing some sad,
lonely little man...

15:03.778 --> 15:07.031
...who single-handedly haunts his own
home in the Hollywood Hills.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.534
That was incredibly gay.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.870
- Good God. Ouch.
- Yeah, you should see the other guy.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.290
Harry, this is our generous host,
Harlan Dexter.

15:16.499 --> 15:20.962
Ah, yes, of course. You're Dabney's
golden boy from back East.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.880
I hope it isn't past your bedtime.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.424
No, sir. My mom used to say
I had the neon disease.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.635
When the neon lights came on,
I woke up.

15:27.885 --> 15:32.056
I'm afraid I'm similarly afflicted.
My daughter just lived 10 years in Paris.

15:32.139 --> 15:35.810
She says it is heaven
for the vampire set.

15:37.103 --> 15:42.024
If you'll excuse me, apparently I'm
meant to help cut this monstrosity.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.654
Mom's gone, so it's just him
and his born-again little bundle of joy.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.781
- Born-again? That's precious.
- Isn't it?

15:49.031 --> 15:51.659
Three months ago, she was suing him
over Mom's millions.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.911
He called her a- Well, a bad word.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.916
Cunt. Welcome to Hollywood.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.836
Okay, I apologize.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.464
That is a terrible scene.
It's like, "Why was that in the movie?

16:05.715 --> 16:08.092
Gee, you think maybe
it'll come back later, maybe?"

16:08.217 --> 16:11.220
I hate that. A TV's on,
talking about the new power plant.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.097
Wonder where the climax will happen.

16:13.306 --> 16:17.143
Or that shot of the cook in
Hunt for Red October. Sorry.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.770
Hi, thank you for coming.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.940
Hey, do you know that blond gal
who just left?

16:23.065 --> 16:26.694
Oh, the one with the guy
that beat the shit out of you? No.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.654
Bye, have a better night.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.032
She had something, that gal,
this quality.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.783
Like the girl from high school...

16:33.034 --> 16:36.370
...the one that got away. You know
what I mean? That haunts you still.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.456
- Yeah, I had that.
- You did?

16:38.623 --> 16:40.875
Bobby Mills.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.046
Well, maybe you should
try to get in touch.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.381
I got 5 bucks says
you could still get him.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.885
Really? That's funny.
I got a 10 says, "Pass the pepper. "

16:51.052 --> 16:53.804
I got two quarters harmonizing on
"Moonlight in Vermont. "

16:53.971 --> 16:56.057
- What?
- Talking money.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.392
- A talking monkey?
- Talking monkey, yeah.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.896
Came here from the future.
Ugly sucker. Only says, "Ficus. "

17:03.272 --> 17:05.023
Detective lessons tomorrow.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.608
- Don't forget.
- Okay.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.069
And Harry...

17:08.277 --> 17:10.070
Come here.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.573
That girl, I know her.
She's done some work for me.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.492
Try the Domino Room.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.244
Where's that?

17:34.303 --> 17:37.306
- Hey there. I'm Flicka.
- Hey.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.393
- How are you?
- Good. So, what do you do?

17:42.019 --> 17:45.523
- I'm a private detective. And you?
- I'm a stewardess.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.358
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.777
- Well, nice to meet you.
- That it?

17:49.944 --> 17:52.071
- Yeah.
- Yep.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.956
Could I have a Jack and soda? Thanks.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.126
Evening. Harry.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.421
God, I'm sore.

18:08.629 --> 18:12.925
I mean, physically, not like a guy
who's angry in a movie in the 1950s.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.266
- Didn't I see you at a party hours ago?
- Why?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.185
- Why what?
- Why me?

18:22.310 --> 18:27.190
Seriously, why not the girl over there?
Look, she's very pretty.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.649
Which one?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.152
On the left,
next to Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.446
Oh, that's a bit of a reach.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.199
I'm interrupting. I feel badly.
What are you drinking?

18:36.407 --> 18:38.993
- Bad.
- Bad? Sorry?

18:39.202 --> 18:40.703
- You feel bad.
- Bad?

18:40.995 --> 18:44.332
"Badly" is an adverb. To say you
feel badly says that the mechanism...

18:44.540 --> 18:49.212
- ...which allows you to feel is broken.
- Well, that one over there?

18:49.420 --> 18:51.172
Between- Oh, God, nix, nix. That's-

18:52.131 --> 18:54.842
- The blond. The blond's pathetic.
- Because?

18:55.051 --> 18:59.764
For starters, she's been fucked
more times than she's had hot meals.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.642
I heard. It was neck and neck,
and then she skipped lunch.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.519
- Worst thing, though...
- Do tell.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.688
Worst thing is she's 35 years old
and still trying to act.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.608
I see her at auditions all the time.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.903
- It's over, baby. You missed.
- That's charitable of you.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.696
May I ask how old you are?

19:16.739 --> 19:18.407
- Go for it.
- Okay, how old are you?

19:18.616 --> 19:19.992
- Thirty-four.
- Yeah?

19:20.076 --> 19:23.663
- I'm a baby.
- Where's your buddy? The guy you-

19:23.955 --> 19:27.291
- The guy you left the party with?
- He's a fucking asshole.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.460
I just needed a ride.
Sorry, I swear a lot.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.629
- I know. It's okay.
- Did you know the host?

19:31.838 --> 19:34.131
- No.
- He looked familiar, though.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.217
Probably an actor.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.554
Go away, Mr. Fly.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.058
- I was talking to your friend.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.769
Sunshine, she'll be back to you
in a minute. Relax.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.729
She doesn't have a minute.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.777
Tell you what, if you change your mind
about that drink...

19:54.861 --> 19:58.239
...I'll be over there
with Native American Joe Pesci.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.870
- You are so...
- That was good, right?

20:04.078 --> 20:05.872
Why are you humoring him? Stop it.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.875
You know what,
there's an empty table over there.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.128
I hear it's a recommended
cheeseball hangout.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.547
Your mouth is a recommended place
to put a sock.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.300
Princess. Scary friend.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.802
Goddamn it.

20:19.927 --> 20:24.098
Harry Lockhart, are you gonna
recognize me or what?

20:24.265 --> 20:26.517
God! Embrey, Indiana!

20:28.895 --> 20:31.272
Loves snakes, afraid of spiders.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.943
Come on, remember?
You were Amazing Harry-

20:36.194 --> 20:38.571
- No, no, no. Harold the Great.
- Harmony?

20:38.779 --> 20:40.156
You cut me in half, remember?

20:40.364 --> 20:44.327
Oh, shit. Oh, my God. How are you?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.621
Okay, I was a bad narrator again...

20:46.829 --> 20:49.957
...because the kid at the beginning,
the magician, that was me.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.834
I don't want to put this on you...

20:52.043 --> 20:54.962
...but if you've been paying attention,
I shouldn't have to-

20:55.171 --> 20:57.507
Great. No wonder. Ma and Pa Kettle.
I got an idea.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.260
Why not put these two lame-o extras
in front of the mammoth fucking lens?

21:01.511 --> 21:03.596
Boo. Scat. Fat lady, leave.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.140
See there? "Harold. "

21:06.182 --> 21:08.809
Remember how I said
this high school chick haunted me?

21:09.060 --> 21:11.103
How seeing Harmony made me
think of her?

21:11.187 --> 21:13.731
That's because it was her.
It all came flooding back.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.401
How I was the one she confided in.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.404
While she was doing every other guy.

21:21.739 --> 21:24.450
It was the first time I felt
that how pitying someone...

21:24.575 --> 21:27.662
...and wanting to fuck them
can get all tangled up in your head.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.331
Overwhelming sadness.
Meanwhile, you got a rodney.

21:30.498 --> 21:34.377
Is that sick? I think-
Yeah, I think that's sick.

21:35.419 --> 21:40.299
Leaving my sister back home,
leaving her there all alone...

21:42.385 --> 21:44.929
Hardest thing I ever did.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.686
Do you remember
when we were real little...

21:51.894 --> 21:54.939
...and a movie crew came to town?

21:55.064 --> 21:57.984
That mystery flick with the guy,
Jonny what's-his-name?

21:58.276 --> 22:00.111
- Gossamer.
- Jonny Gossamer. Right.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.447
Your mom went nuts,
and she bought all the books and stuff.

22:03.823 --> 22:08.035
- That was- God, that was forever ago.
- Yeah, that was back in the day.

22:09.412 --> 22:10.788
Harry...

22:12.039 --> 22:14.125
...I didn't get famous.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.879
Yet.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.842
I did...

22:23.050 --> 22:24.927
...get to do this one commercial.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.555
You're shitting me. Which one?

22:27.763 --> 22:30.141
Well, you know the one with the bear?

22:30.391 --> 22:33.728
And it goes- Well, this is funny.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.814
- "I prefer Genaros, but-"
- "But I'm a bear, what do I know?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.816
I suck heads off fish. " That was you?

22:38.983 --> 22:41.819
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was. Yeah.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.696
- That's awesome.
- Commercial.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.406
Come on, that's a big deal.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.658
- That's a national commercial.
- Harry, stop.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.537
It's nothing. There was actually this
kind of cool moment where I got...

22:51.704 --> 22:53.706
...to sort of do the wave.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.085
"I prefer Genaros. "

22:58.336 --> 23:00.546
- Whatever, it's nothing.
- It's pretty cool.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.466
- It's nothing special at all.
- Well, I think it's special.

23:04.425 --> 23:07.178
Punk-rock Steven Seagal
thinks it's special.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.889
Right there, at your 11 o'clock.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.557
That's dead-on, right?

23:11.766 --> 23:14.477
That's all right.
I had him pegged when I came in.

23:15.436 --> 23:19.357
Come back to the hotel for a little while,
just have one drink. Bring your friend.

23:19.607 --> 23:23.528
It'd just be a drink. You'll be home faster
than you can say "Jack Robinson. "

23:23.653 --> 23:25.821
I don't know about that. I can say...

23:27.281 --> 23:30.868
- ... "Jack Robinson" pretty fast.
- I'm timing you.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.372
Jack Robinson.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.778
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- I'm really sorry.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.573
God, you still look great.
You're just stunning. I like-

24:08.781 --> 24:10.575
- Why are you here?
- Good question.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.161
Sounds crazy, but I don't remember
what occurred...

24:13.411 --> 24:15.371
...between the hours of 2 and 5,
a blur.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.540
- Really? Where's Marleah?
- Marleah?

24:17.748 --> 24:20.459
- The girl you...
- Marleah fell asleep at my place...

24:20.626 --> 24:22.170
...and I didn't see you leave-

24:22.336 --> 24:24.672
I left when you had your tongue
down her throat.

24:24.839 --> 24:26.215
- I did?
- Yeah.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.718
God. No, wrong throat, wrong woman.
That's bad.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.095
Yeah, that's bad.
You got 10 seconds, Harry.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.264
Oh, boy, pressure, pressure.
I came here...

24:33.514 --> 24:36.017
...because I think
you're intelligent and attractive-

24:36.184 --> 24:39.687
That's plenty. Stop. Oh, my God!
I can't believe you'd come here...

24:39.770 --> 24:42.481
...to tell me you like me
after you fucked my friend!

24:42.690 --> 24:45.109
That's just it, I didn't.
I believe that I did not.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.903
What? You said you don't remember!

24:47.195 --> 24:50.615
If I don't remember because I was drunk,
how could I have gotten it up?

24:50.781 --> 24:52.742
I know this is outrageous
and not normal.

24:52.867 --> 24:56.746
I'm not pretending that I'm normal.
I just chickened out-

24:57.288 --> 25:01.042
Moron. Why? Why? Why?

25:30.655 --> 25:34.075
And the plots, they all have this thing,
this formula that was so cool.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.577
Seriously, I would go through one
in a day.

25:36.786 --> 25:40.331
- A whole book in one day. Wow.
- See, Gossamer would always take on...

25:40.456 --> 25:42.625
...two cases
that were seemingly unrelated.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.169
One's normal
and the other's some wild shit...

25:45.336 --> 25:47.505
...then you'd find out
that they're connected.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.757
That it's all one case.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.384
That's the essence of the-

25:51.509 --> 25:56.013
Yeah, I get that all the time. Would
you mind not rooting around in there?

25:56.848 --> 25:58.224
It's tiny. Is this real?

25:58.391 --> 26:01.602
Yeah, it's a derringer. It's loaded.

26:02.019 --> 26:05.273
- I call it my faggot gun.
- Because?

26:05.481 --> 26:09.527
It's only good for a couple shots, then
you gotta drop it for something better.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.780
You asked, chief.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.325
On with our lesson.

26:17.034 --> 26:21.330
- My client is one Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.
- Ames.

26:21.539 --> 26:24.625
Female. She hired me
to do some video surveillance.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.460
- Is she a looker?
- Oh, man.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.881
She opens the door,
she got nothing on but the radio.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.425
Invites me to sit down,
sits on my lap...

26:32.592 --> 26:34.969
- ...fires up a smoke.
- Really?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.597
No. Idiot.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.807
She hired me over the phone.

26:39.891 --> 26:42.894
- Paid for it with a credit card.
- Okay.

26:43.102 --> 26:48.649
Rule number one:
This business, real life, it's boring.

26:48.858 --> 26:51.235
- Do you have to smoke?
- You want me to put it out?

26:51.360 --> 26:55.531
Yeah, soon as you find a large, brown
clump of shrubs, just throw it in there.

26:55.740 --> 26:59.494
So you knew Harmony in high school.
You said she dissed you.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.079
No, not really.
She fucked every other guy but me.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.499
No, that's not true.
She made one concession.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.084
She agreed not to fuck my best friend,
Chook Chutney.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.545
He was my best friend,
so she gave me that.

27:09.837 --> 27:13.591
- Well, that was nice of her.
- Even if he asked, she said she wouldn't.

27:13.674 --> 27:16.594
Stay put. Be quiet.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.765
"Chook Chutney"? Yeah, he's gay.

27:35.988 --> 27:39.826
- What's wrong with his car?
- Do I look like a mechanic?

27:41.786 --> 27:44.455
- Are we gonna follow him?
- Where'd he go?

27:44.580 --> 27:48.209
He was right in front of us,
then he cut in- Where is he?

27:52.046 --> 27:55.341
What the hell. He's gotta be somewhere.
He turned right in front of us.

28:01.264 --> 28:03.808
- Jesus!
- Shit!

28:03.933 --> 28:05.476
Harry, come back.

28:05.601 --> 28:06.978
Harry.

28:07.103 --> 28:10.022
- There's no one in the car. Harry.
- What?

28:10.189 --> 28:12.400
Harry, stop.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.319
- I think it's going down.
- Wait, the sound.

28:15.486 --> 28:17.572
- Check the back seat.
- No, get the keys!

28:17.780 --> 28:19.991
The keys! Get the keys!

28:25.496 --> 28:26.706
Perry.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.585
Perry?

28:32.003 --> 28:33.504
Shit.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.968
Perry!

28:42.096 --> 28:44.515
Where'd she come from?

28:44.599 --> 28:48.019
She was in the trunk.
I had to shoot the lock to get it open.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.604
Oh, Jesus.

28:51.022 --> 28:53.107
God, what did they do to her face?

28:54.984 --> 28:58.821
- Is she dead?
- No. She's resting her eyes for a minute.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.282
Of course she's fucking dead.
Her neck's broken.

29:15.129 --> 29:17.507
- Hey, what the hell's going on?
- Shut up.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.968
- Hey, we got a dead girl here!
- Hey, shut up.

29:21.219 --> 29:23.596
Two guys in masks,
and there they go.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.681
What the fuck is going on?
This is bad.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.642
We gotta roll before the cops come.

29:27.892 --> 29:30.811
- Nix. We go right to the cops.
- Exactly, to the cops...

29:30.978 --> 29:34.649
...who'll believe that she broke her neck
before you shot her in the head.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.234
What?

29:36.400 --> 29:38.736
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh, God.

29:38.861 --> 29:41.322
- We gotta go. Go, go, go.
- Oh, God.

29:41.531 --> 29:43.324
Oh, God.

29:43.407 --> 29:46.327
- All right, we're out of here.
- We gotta go, go, go.

29:46.536 --> 29:47.912
Where's my gun?

29:47.995 --> 29:49.872
- No, I-
- Give me my gun.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.541
- I got rid of it.
- Say again.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.751
Threw it in the lake.
You wouldn't, I would.

29:53.918 --> 29:56.671
I got priors in New York,
so I can't be messing around-

29:56.754 --> 29:58.464
- You threw it away?
- It's evidence.

29:58.756 --> 30:01.008
- Watch it. Relax.
- Okay, okay. No, I'm sorry.

30:01.259 --> 30:04.220
- I got a little nonplussed there.
- This is crazy. I understand.

30:04.762 --> 30:07.139
- What is that? Is that a clue?
- What do you mean?

30:07.390 --> 30:08.850
- Do you see that?
- In the thing?

30:09.767 --> 30:11.018
What were you thinking?

30:11.269 --> 30:14.355
My $2000 ceramic Vektor
my mother got me as a special gift...

30:14.605 --> 30:17.900
...you threw next to the car.
What happens when they drag the lake?

30:17.984 --> 30:19.694
You think they'll find my pistol?

30:19.861 --> 30:23.447
Jesus. Look up "idiot" in the dictionary.
You know what you'll find?

30:23.656 --> 30:25.199
- A picture of me?
- No...

30:25.449 --> 30:28.870
...the definition of the word "idiot,"
which you fucking are.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.582
Bitch client.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.042
Hires me, has me witness a murder.

30:35.126 --> 30:37.420
- Can I use a dry towel? This towel's wet.
- No.

30:37.587 --> 30:39.797
- This towel is wet.
- The towel is for the seat.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.842
This was for your shoes.
You handed it to me for my face?

30:43.050 --> 30:45.469
- This is wet. Can I use a dry-?
- It's dirty. No.

30:45.553 --> 30:48.222
- Can I-?
- No. Stop dripping.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.601
Shit better be improving your acting.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.364
- Get out.
- Sorry about the gun.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.241
Whatever. Out.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.660
Go. Sleep badly.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.580
Any questions, hesitate to call.

31:12.622 --> 31:14.624
- Bad.
- Excuse me?

31:14.832 --> 31:16.083
Sleep bad.

31:16.334 --> 31:19.337
Otherwise, it seems like
the mechanism that allows sleep-

31:19.504 --> 31:23.007
What, fuckhead? "Badly" is an adverb.
Who taught you grammar? Out. Vanish.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.595
- I'll give you a buzz.
- Die.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.565
That's all right, don't apologize.

31:39.774 --> 31:42.985
- Blow me. You forgot this.
- Oh, thanks.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.113
- Hello?
- I'm trying to locate Harry Lockhart.

31:46.239 --> 31:48.032
- Speaking.
- I'm detective Sgt. Kale.

31:48.199 --> 31:50.284
Mind answering a question or two?

31:50.535 --> 31:52.620
Of course, no problem.
Fire away, officer.

31:52.662 --> 31:56.040
Are you familiar with a woman
by the name of Harmony Faith Lane?

31:56.249 --> 31:57.583
Yeah, what's this-?

31:57.667 --> 32:00.586
Are you aware of giving your number
to Miss Lane recently?

32:00.837 --> 32:02.922
- On a slip of paper, perhaps?
- No.

32:03.130 --> 32:06.050
- Are you sure?
- Well, maybe she had my number. Why?

32:06.259 --> 32:10.137
We're required by law to treat every
suicide as a potential homicide.

32:10.179 --> 32:12.390
Harmony Lane shot herself, sir.

32:12.515 --> 32:15.017
- Suicide?
- Yes-

32:15.184 --> 32:16.686
Hello?

32:16.894 --> 32:18.646
Hello?

32:21.566 --> 32:23.484
- I'll be goddamned.
- Jesus.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.575
Don't blame yourself. Listen...

32:30.700 --> 32:33.995
- ...sometimes these things just happen-
- For a reason.

32:34.203 --> 32:36.289
For a reason? Fuck that.

32:38.166 --> 32:41.169
Why? Because I fall off a building,
10 people in Baltimore...

32:41.294 --> 32:43.171
...survive a bus crash?

32:43.379 --> 32:47.675
Swell, they're enjoying Baltimore.
I'm lying here with my brains out.

32:49.093 --> 32:51.179
I've been to Baltimore, you win.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.849
Listen...

32:56.601 --> 33:00.021
- ...I'm really sorry. I gotta go.
- Yeah.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.358
I gotta go.

33:06.319 --> 33:07.945
I have to go.

33:22.460 --> 33:25.463
Genaros. Pure drinking pleasure.

33:25.713 --> 33:28.633
I prefer Genaros.
But what do I know? I'm a bear.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.636
I suck the heads off fish.

33:33.221 --> 33:34.972
Genaros.

33:37.475 --> 33:42.021
I was tired. I was pissed. I was wetter
than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club.

33:42.313 --> 33:45.733
I needed a hot bath, a warm bed.

33:47.610 --> 33:50.238
But the night had other plans for me.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.406
- Oh, you did?
- I got the Cyber Agent.

33:52.615 --> 33:55.409
- You got the Cyber Agent.
- It has all the cool weapons.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.078
You got Protocop coming too.

33:57.328 --> 34:01.082
It's gonna be worth more too
because I think he's, like, paralyzed now.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.085
Son of a bitch!

34:04.293 --> 34:08.589
See, I forgot, old Jonny,
he always had two cases. Remember?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.299
How are you?

34:10.550 --> 34:12.301
Hey.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.389
She's gone, Harry.

34:16.597 --> 34:19.308
- Yeah.
- She's gone.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.520
I know. Who?

34:23.020 --> 34:26.065
Fact is, she stole not only
your credit card, but your ID.

34:26.274 --> 34:28.775
We're very sorry about
the mix-up on our part.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.237
So are you willing to positively identify
this woman as your-

34:32.446 --> 34:34.322
- My sister! Yes!
- Your sister was here?

34:34.532 --> 34:36.617
Oh, God!
God, we haven't spoken in years.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.328
She's never forgiven me
for leaving her all alone.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.373
- I'm just gonna get you a blanket.
- I don't want a blanket!

34:42.540 --> 34:44.208
- But you're shivering.
- I don't care!

34:44.458 --> 34:46.502
You're freaking me out.
Will you relax, okay?

34:46.710 --> 34:48.713
- Oh, God.
- I'm so glad that you're okay...

34:48.920 --> 34:52.049
...but now, I don't know, you're
making me more nervous. Sit down.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.634
- Okay.
- Tell me what happened.

34:53.801 --> 34:57.346
Yesterday, Jenna,
she got into my house, Harry.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.473
She must have been broke,
I don't know.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.060
She swiped 200 bucks, a credit card,
California ID, God knows what else.

35:03.311 --> 35:05.146
- Right.
- Oh, God.

35:05.396 --> 35:06.939
- No more lies, Harry.
- No.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.649
No.

35:08.816 --> 35:10.735
Are you a detective?

35:13.529 --> 35:15.406
- Are you a detective?
- Who told you that?

35:15.615 --> 35:18.326
Flicka. Flicka.
You know, my friend? She told me.

35:18.534 --> 35:20.077
She told me you were a detective.

35:20.203 --> 35:22.580
- If you are, then I really need your help.
- Well-

35:22.830 --> 35:24.499
That's empty, honey.

35:24.624 --> 35:29.462
Okay, I know this sounds crazy,
Harry, but listen. Okay. Okay.

35:29.670 --> 35:33.341
- My sister's been living out here...
- Harmony's sister, dead. What the hell?

35:33.549 --> 35:36.886
What was she even doing here?
The lady in the lake, now the sister.

35:37.094 --> 35:40.431
This was two corpses in three hours.
Am I crazy? That's unusual, right?

35:40.640 --> 35:43.226
Yeah, looking back,
I maybe should've told her...

35:43.434 --> 35:45.353
...I wasn't really a nipple- Detective.

35:45.645 --> 35:49.023
Detective. Sorry. I should've said
something, but she wouldn't shut up.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.484
The card she stole from me
was maxed out.

35:51.692 --> 35:56.280
Right before she died, she charged over
$2000 on it. That's weird, isn't it?

35:56.489 --> 36:00.368
Sentron something.
Some bullshit company! Plus-

36:00.535 --> 36:03.913
Red flag, Harry. She took her
birth control pill for the day.

36:04.121 --> 36:06.207
Why would she even bother
with the pill, huh?

36:06.374 --> 36:09.418
She was murdered, Harry.
She was murdered. She was murdered.

36:09.585 --> 36:12.296
Honey, all right.
Relax, relax, relax. Okay, relax.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.090
Are you gonna help me, Harry?

36:14.340 --> 36:17.134
- I gotta check my schedule-
- If you're not gonna help me...

36:17.343 --> 36:20.137
...I need to get out of here,
find someone that'll help me.

36:20.304 --> 36:22.765
- I just gotta check my schedule.
- Can you help me?

36:22.974 --> 36:25.560
If you're not gonna help me,
I need to find somebody else!

36:25.685 --> 36:28.604
- My caseload is pretty-
- Oh, Harry, thank you.

36:57.884 --> 37:00.136
Yuck, come on.

37:12.190 --> 37:14.984
- It was nothing. I didn't do anything.
- What are you doing?

37:15.109 --> 37:17.570
- I didn't do anything.
- You were grabbing my tit.

37:17.737 --> 37:20.198
No, there was a spider.
There was a big spider.

37:20.448 --> 37:23.075
- Oh, please, whatever.
- I swear to God.

37:23.242 --> 37:28.122
Look, I'll find it. I'll find the thing.
Where are you? Fuzzy little bitch.

37:28.372 --> 37:31.751
- Whatever. It's okay, I believe you.
- Clearly, you don't.

37:32.043 --> 37:35.379
Look, Harry, you grabbed my tit.
It's life, all right? It's no biggie.

37:37.006 --> 37:41.093
No biggie? Guy grabs your tit,
"That's life, no biggie"?

37:41.385 --> 37:44.430
I mean, what kind of talk is that?

37:44.555 --> 37:47.975
No, you tell me. What kind of talk
is that? I can't believe you.

37:48.059 --> 37:51.062
I can't believe that
that's the reaction that-

37:55.942 --> 37:57.360
See there?

37:57.693 --> 37:59.278
Yeah.

37:59.403 --> 38:03.032
- I trust you.
- Right.

38:03.324 --> 38:06.994
What is your problem? I'm letting you
off the hook. You didn't do anything.

38:07.078 --> 38:08.579
No, but you thought I did.

38:08.955 --> 38:12.291
Do you get it? I'm on the hook. The hook
is my home. Do you understand?

38:12.667 --> 38:16.879
Listen to me. I grab your tit,
it's a fucking biggie!

38:17.088 --> 38:19.340
That came out wrong.
But what I'm saying is...

38:19.590 --> 38:23.553
...you act like, "Oops, it's an okay lapse.
You know, everybody does it. "

38:24.345 --> 38:26.681
What the fuck kind of guys
you hang out with here?

38:26.889 --> 38:29.559
I mean, are you the kind of girl
who like, you know...?

38:29.809 --> 38:31.769
Who what, Harry?

38:33.020 --> 38:34.730
Who what?

38:36.941 --> 38:38.651
Forget it.

38:39.402 --> 38:41.696
I'm sorry, just relax.
Just get some rest, okay?

38:41.863 --> 38:46.075
Okay, we'll start on your case
tomorrow. All right?

38:46.284 --> 38:48.077
- Afternoon good?
- Whatever, Harry.

38:48.244 --> 38:49.620
- I'm going.
- Okay.

38:49.787 --> 38:53.166
- I'm taking some sweats, all right?
- Yeah, anything you want to borrow.

38:53.374 --> 38:56.419
- I'll give them back.
- Yeah. Yeah, anything in the drawer.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.462
If it's in the drawer, it's clean.

38:59.839 --> 39:01.215
Night, Harry.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.595
Harry?

39:06.929 --> 39:08.681
This is...

39:08.806 --> 39:11.851
- This is really great.
- Isn't it?

39:12.018 --> 39:15.354
- I'm leaving.
- Yeah, some nice rest.

39:15.563 --> 39:16.856
Bye.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.525
Fuck off-!

39:20.026 --> 39:22.695
Say again? They gave her back?

39:22.820 --> 39:25.740
Yes. She's in my shower.
I'm looking at her, for chrissake.

39:25.865 --> 39:28.075
That's impossible.
They don't even know you.

39:28.201 --> 39:32.997
You're right. The body can't be here.
This is all a dream. There's Elmo the elf.

39:33.206 --> 39:35.291
- Shut up. How did they get in?
- I don't know.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.710
How am I supposed to know?
Fire escape, maybe.

39:37.877 --> 39:41.589
Okay, first things first. We gotta move
her somewhere. You got gloves?

39:41.756 --> 39:43.633
- Excuse me?
- Gloves. Do you have gloves?

39:43.841 --> 39:47.887
You have to move her. If it's a frame-up,
some asshole's calling the cops on you.

39:48.137 --> 39:50.932
Do this: Wrap up the body
in a blanket, a sheet, anything.

39:51.140 --> 39:54.393
- Okay, any particular kind of gloves?
- Yes, fawn.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.020
Will you fucking hurry?

39:56.103 --> 39:57.522
- Perry?
- Yeah?

39:57.730 --> 39:59.815
- I peed on it.
- What? You peed on what?

39:59.941 --> 40:02.735
I peed on the corpse.
Can they do, like, an ID from that?

40:02.819 --> 40:05.738
- I'm sorry, you peed on-?
- On the corpse. My question is-

40:05.905 --> 40:07.615
No, my question. I get to go first.

40:07.782 --> 40:10.117
Why in poo-perfect hell
would you pee on a corpse?

40:10.326 --> 40:12.119
It's not like I did it for kicks.

40:12.328 --> 40:14.997
You said this doesn't happen.
This is your fault!

40:15.248 --> 40:18.459
Shut up and listen.
First, we have to wrap the body.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.419
Second, you've got to find the gun.

40:20.628 --> 40:23.422
- Say this with me, "Find the gun. "
- Find the gun.

40:23.673 --> 40:25.299
Damn it, I threw it in the lake.

40:25.508 --> 40:28.803
Not my gun, idiot. They dropped
the body on you, it's a frame-up.

40:28.886 --> 40:31.597
Then they also have planted a gun,
trust me. Move it.

40:31.806 --> 40:34.100
I'll be there in four minutes.

40:52.451 --> 40:58.666
Caller specified room 714, some sort of
brawl or something. Violent.

40:58.916 --> 41:01.919
Yeah, 714. Lockhart.

41:02.170 --> 41:05.715
- Let me get you the key.
- Actually, it's not 714, it's 514.

41:05.882 --> 41:08.301
I was just up there,
and it's really noisy.

41:08.467 --> 41:11.554
- Let's get the key.
- Yep, pretty awful.

41:22.899 --> 41:25.401
- Don't answer that.
- Yeah, duh.

41:25.818 --> 41:27.820
- That it?
- No, that's the corpse...

41:27.862 --> 41:29.864
...from the last guy who stayed here.

41:29.947 --> 41:31.365
Fuck off. Was there a gun?

41:31.574 --> 41:34.494
Yeah, it's right here. Perry,
sons of bitches made us, made me.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.788
I'm in town for two days, they know
who I am and where to find me.

41:37.997 --> 41:41.876
- That's impossible.
- Yeah, it's totally nuts. Back stairway.

41:43.503 --> 41:47.006
I forgot to tell you, Harmony's alive.
She thinks her sister was murdered.

41:47.173 --> 41:49.091
- Come again?
- Never mind.

42:04.815 --> 42:07.860
See, these dudes tonight,
they see two assholes out of nowhere.

42:07.902 --> 42:10.363
- What do they think?
- They think we know something.

42:10.655 --> 42:13.741
They panic. They got a body,
they've gotta dispose of the evidence.

42:13.991 --> 42:15.827
In my shower?
Come on, you said real life.

42:16.077 --> 42:20.373
- They were setting you up, dummy.
- They're not setting me up. Shut up.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.875
You change your tune
every five minutes.

42:22.959 --> 42:25.253
- Kiss me.
- What? No, no, no.

42:28.798 --> 42:31.926
Check out Doris and Lucinda
over here.

42:39.642 --> 42:40.977
These lessons suck.

42:41.185 --> 42:44.438
I quit. This is not being a detective.
Corpses floating in lakes...

42:44.647 --> 42:48.609
...people kissing people. This is wrong.
This is every shade of wrong.

42:48.818 --> 42:50.945
Somebody wanna fill me in?

42:52.238 --> 42:54.532
She thinks I'm a detective,
so go along with it.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.117
- What?
- Don't fuck me up.

42:56.701 --> 42:58.786
Hey.

42:59.036 --> 43:01.831
Do you know the cops
are looking for you, Harry?

43:02.081 --> 43:03.416
- They are?
- Yeah.

43:03.583 --> 43:06.502
I sent them to the wrong room.
I didn't know what else to do.

43:06.752 --> 43:09.255
You did fine.
Perry and I, we're just-

43:09.422 --> 43:12.091
- Hiya, Perry.
- We're just running, you know, a game.

43:12.175 --> 43:13.926
Perry, what do you call it?

43:14.051 --> 43:18.431
The old Bring Them In and Push
Them Out. That's what we're doing.

43:18.639 --> 43:20.016
What's going on?

43:20.099 --> 43:23.019
Why are you and Perry nacking
on each other?

43:26.772 --> 43:30.443
I sent her home believing, A, we'd meet
tomorrow to go over her case...

43:30.610 --> 43:32.695
...and, B, I wasn't actually gay.

43:32.987 --> 43:35.198
Do not ask me how I did B.

43:35.740 --> 43:37.533
Why didn't we just leave it there?

43:37.700 --> 43:40.036
Think, dummy.
A 911 call from your hotel room...

43:40.203 --> 43:42.830
...all of a sudden,
there's a corpse outside? Bad idea.

43:43.039 --> 43:46.459
Speaking of bad ideas, what's this
about you taking on your own case?

43:46.626 --> 43:48.753
Of all the dipshit things to do.

43:49.003 --> 43:50.421
Killed herself, by the way.

43:50.755 --> 43:52.715
Killed herself.
I solved your case for you.

43:52.840 --> 43:55.885
- Harmony's convinced-
- I don't care about- Listen to me.

43:56.052 --> 43:59.263
- Little sis punched her own ticket.
- Okay. Gotcha.

43:59.514 --> 44:02.850
All right, this looks good up ahead.
Time to lose the luggage.

44:10.775 --> 44:12.443
Sorry, sweetheart.

44:12.652 --> 44:14.529
You deserved better.

44:25.498 --> 44:27.458
Before I left,
I got her into foster care.

44:27.625 --> 44:31.337
I've never told you just how awful he
treated her. My dad, I'm talking about.

44:31.462 --> 44:34.382
I'll tell you what,
I take notes, in general...

44:34.507 --> 44:39.136
...so if you're just real specific,
thorough and precise, that'll help.

44:39.303 --> 44:42.306
I remember only lying to her one time.

44:42.473 --> 44:43.933
I said to her:

44:44.100 --> 44:47.103
"Maybe the man who is living here
is not your father. "

44:47.395 --> 44:50.064
You told your sister
she was adopted, yeah?

44:50.982 --> 44:52.483
No, I did one better.

44:52.692 --> 44:54.694
I told her her real father
was an actor...

44:54.861 --> 44:57.363
...who was in the movie
that came through town.

44:57.572 --> 45:00.283
- Jonny Gossamer-
- Jonny Gossamer movie. That's right.

45:01.117 --> 45:03.452
I told Jenna one day she'd go
to Hollywood...

45:03.619 --> 45:06.455
...and she'd meet her famous,
real father.

45:19.343 --> 45:22.263
She believed me, Harry,
and she came out here looking for him.

45:22.513 --> 45:25.725
Okay, this is a bunch.
I can start my...

45:26.058 --> 45:28.352
- ...process, I guess.
- Thank you.

45:28.561 --> 45:31.480
I'm on the case. Here is my card.

45:33.107 --> 45:35.860
- It's a magic card, so...
- Wow, "the Amazing Harold. "

45:36.027 --> 45:39.071
- Just say "abracadabra. "
- What happened, somebody sue you?

45:39.739 --> 45:42.241
It used to be "alakazam"
when you cut me in half.

45:42.408 --> 45:45.036
And, not to be picky,
but it was "Harold the Great. "

45:45.244 --> 45:48.915
No, I used to be great,
now I'm amazing. Get with it.

45:50.249 --> 45:52.502
Hi, it's me. You hear anything?

45:52.752 --> 45:54.587
No, there's nothing
in the papers, so...

45:54.837 --> 45:57.507
I'm busy working on Harmony's case.

45:57.757 --> 45:59.091
What case? Leave her alone.

45:59.300 --> 46:02.386
News on Channel 5, just starting.
Call me after.

46:03.346 --> 46:06.140
- a kidnapping gone wrong.
It is unclear why his daughter...

46:06.432 --> 46:08.226
...was subsequently murdered
or where...

46:08.518 --> 46:12.271
...for she was almost certainly killed
and then moved, police sources say.

46:12.355 --> 46:15.191
Veronica Dexter was reported missing
yesterday afternoon...

46:15.358 --> 46:18.110
...when she failed to greet
her boyfriend at the airport.

46:18.277 --> 46:21.447
Miss Dexter recently made headlines
when she returned from Paris...

46:21.614 --> 46:24.909
...and withdrew her multimillion-dollar
lawsuit against her father...

46:25.201 --> 46:27.870
...actor-turned-entrepreneur
Harlan Dexter.

46:27.995 --> 46:30.206
Mr. Dexter owns
the prestigious Dexter Clinic.

46:30.373 --> 46:33.960
His wife died last spring,
prompting Veronica's return to the U.S...

46:34.126 --> 46:37.880
...and a father-daughter reconciliation
following years of estrangement.

46:38.130 --> 46:42.343
Veronica Dexter,
25 years old yesterday. Paul.

46:42.718 --> 46:44.887
We were just at that party.
Are you telling me...

46:45.096 --> 46:47.723
...that the girl in the lake,
that was Veronica Dexter?

46:47.890 --> 46:49.684
Positive ID, scars, dental records.

46:49.892 --> 46:52.478
- You talked to your police guy?
- Yeah, not much there.

46:52.603 --> 46:55.523
The lab report came back,
no sign of rape.

46:56.023 --> 46:57.400
Boils down to this:

46:57.608 --> 47:01.487
Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon
about 4:30, left her home.

47:01.654 --> 47:05.408
Went off to the airport, pick up
some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.

47:05.533 --> 47:09.162
- That was the last anybody saw of her?
- With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.

47:09.287 --> 47:10.830
Police ever find the car?

47:10.955 --> 47:13.166
No, genius, that was us. Remember?

47:13.332 --> 47:14.834
Oh, yeah, right.

47:15.251 --> 47:17.837
- The killers were at the party, Harry.
- They were?

47:18.045 --> 47:21.174
- The killers were at Dexter's?
- That's how they recognized you.

47:21.340 --> 47:24.594
It's getting too scary. You gotta bail.
Get a flight out, today.

47:24.719 --> 47:27.847
But I got my screen test Tuesday.
I'll go Wednesday.

47:28.055 --> 47:30.850
- You're not getting the part.
- Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.

47:31.142 --> 47:33.769
- I know it's a long shot.
- You're not gonna get the part.

47:34.020 --> 47:36.606
You're not listening to me.
You won't get the- Harry!

47:36.814 --> 47:41.527
You're not gonna get the part, okay?
Colin Farrell wants too much money.

47:41.694 --> 47:43.196
Do you get me now?

47:44.113 --> 47:47.658
Dabney, he unearths a discovery.
New kid, works for cheap.

47:47.825 --> 47:50.286
Flies him out here,
high profile, parties...

47:50.453 --> 47:53.498
...screen tests,
detective lessons, all of it.

47:53.664 --> 47:55.041
You were just being used.

47:55.166 --> 47:57.877
Shave a couple million
off of Colin Farrell's price tag.

47:59.754 --> 48:02.048
Sorry, chief. There it is.

48:02.798 --> 48:04.300
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

48:06.844 --> 48:09.972
I understand if you wanna
take a swing at me. You fuck!

48:10.139 --> 48:11.849
You sissy bitch!

48:12.058 --> 48:13.392
Stop.

48:13.643 --> 48:15.728
Don't bother asking Harmony out
on your date.

48:15.895 --> 48:20.733
She wasn't very happy to find out that
you're not a detective, that you lied.

48:20.900 --> 48:22.819
- You told her?
- Pick those up.

48:22.944 --> 48:24.570
Pick them up.

48:25.738 --> 48:28.115
Why did you tell her?
You didn't have to tell her.

48:28.324 --> 48:31.327
- I am an idiot. I thought we were friends.
- We're not friends.

48:31.452 --> 48:34.914
- I was in trouble, you were there for me.
- No, I was- Stop speaking.

48:35.081 --> 48:37.834
I was there protecting
my employer, Dabney. Hello.

48:38.125 --> 48:40.211
He pays me to insulate him
from corpses.

48:45.925 --> 48:48.386
I'm not a nice man, Harry.

48:48.678 --> 48:51.055
Go home before something bad
happens to you.

48:51.222 --> 48:53.683
- What, are you threatening me?
- No, moron.

48:53.766 --> 48:56.352
Go home before the bad guys
do something bad to you.

48:56.602 --> 48:58.437
Right, I get it. Fine.

48:59.522 --> 49:01.357
Merry Christmas.
Sorry I fucked you over.

49:01.607 --> 49:04.694
No problem. Don't quit your gay job.

49:17.039 --> 49:20.126
Arriving passengers
from flight number 758 from Denver...

49:20.376 --> 49:22.879
...may retrieve their baggage
at carousel two.

49:27.884 --> 49:30.970
Hey, Flicka. Hey, it's me, Harry.

49:31.095 --> 49:33.264
Remember me?
What's up, honey? How are you?

49:33.347 --> 49:35.975
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Oh, no, no. I know.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.603
Did you ever think maybe
I don't want to talk to her?

49:38.811 --> 49:41.063
I just saw your really distinctive ears.

49:41.314 --> 49:43.483
You look different,
but it's obviously Flicka.

49:43.608 --> 49:45.943
- Maybe it's you I'm interested in.
- Is that true?

49:46.110 --> 49:49.155
Not really. Look, she must have
a cell phone, right? She must.

49:49.238 --> 49:52.867
- Forget it. This is between you two.
- Look, I got a ticket. I am leaving.

49:52.992 --> 49:55.786
I'm going back to the East Coast,
and that's-

49:55.995 --> 49:58.706
No? Come on,
I just want to say something to her.

49:58.915 --> 50:02.627
Just anything before I split.
I'm begging you. Come on, help me out.

50:02.919 --> 50:04.879
- I'm gonna regret this.
- No, you're not...

50:05.087 --> 50:07.798
...and that is a very smart suit,
by the way.

50:09.884 --> 50:12.220
- It's not here, that's funny.
- What's funny?

50:12.595 --> 50:14.305
Nothing.
It's just under her stage name.

50:14.597 --> 50:18.017
Oh, God. Everyone's got a stage name.
What's her stage name?

50:18.184 --> 50:20.937
Ames. Allison Ames.

50:21.103 --> 50:23.356
Okay, well, I'll just write it down
and then-

50:23.523 --> 50:25.608
Hey! Say that name again.

50:25.858 --> 50:28.820
- Allison Ames.
- Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.

50:29.070 --> 50:30.988
- That's her stage name.
- I just said that.

50:31.280 --> 50:32.907
That's the name on her credit cards.

50:33.115 --> 50:36.661
- How am I supposed to know?
- Fuck! Thanks, honey. Gotta roll.

50:36.828 --> 50:38.538
Later.

50:39.080 --> 50:43.501
You have reached the offices
of Sentron, Inc. Leave a message.

50:44.085 --> 50:47.004
Newsflash, Perry. Your client, Ames,
it was the little sister.

50:47.213 --> 50:48.965
Repeat, the little sister.

50:49.090 --> 50:51.050
That's where Harmony's
2 grand went.

50:51.175 --> 50:53.344
It's in your bank,
you overpriced bastard.

50:53.553 --> 50:55.304
Her kid sister hired you.

50:55.555 --> 51:01.060
Do you get this? Your case and my case
are the same fucking case.

51:01.727 --> 51:03.813
- Come on!
- Get out of my life!

51:04.063 --> 51:07.733
I'm at the airport, right,
and I run into Flicka, and she says-

51:08.860 --> 51:11.404
- Did I just cut off your finger?
- Yeah.

51:11.612 --> 51:16.200
It's on the floor, to my periph- I don't
wanna see it. Pick it up, put it on ice.

51:16.492 --> 51:17.994
Thanks.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.918
You're a genius, Harry.
You're a genius.

51:26.002 --> 51:29.380
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I had to bail
on you, but I had to go to work.

51:29.505 --> 51:32.175
I am going nuts here.
I can't stop thinking about this.

51:32.300 --> 51:34.969
What's my sister's connection
to Veronica Dexter?

51:35.178 --> 51:38.931
She predicted that murder, Harry. She
sent you and Perry to that exact spot.

51:39.140 --> 51:43.144
That whole thing is wild. You know what
else is nuts? You cut off my finger!

51:43.519 --> 51:47.482
Oh, God, Harry,
I am so sorry about that. How is it?

51:47.690 --> 51:50.401
It's fine. It's all shut up.
They gave me painkillers.

51:50.610 --> 51:53.446
- Where's Perry? We gotta find him.
- Perry's coming by here.

51:53.613 --> 51:55.281
I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza.

51:55.531 --> 51:58.826
Remember you said the killer may have
been at Dexter's party?

51:59.035 --> 52:03.039
- Well, that whole bunch is here tonight.
- Honey, put me on the list, I'll drop by.

52:03.206 --> 52:07.460
I'll see if I can stir up the kettle, stick
out my hat, see if anyone shoots at it.

52:07.710 --> 52:09.712
Maybe you could put the hat
in the kettle...

52:09.879 --> 52:13.633
...and if they shoot at it, it'll ricochet.
Harry, you sound trashed.

52:13.883 --> 52:15.635
Give me the address. I'm coming.

52:18.054 --> 52:20.264
I showed up mildly whacked
on Demerol...

52:20.556 --> 52:23.309
...thinking Harmony's theory
wasn't so crazy.

52:23.559 --> 52:24.810
Hi.

52:25.019 --> 52:27.814
What if little sis had been murdered
by the same assholes...

52:28.022 --> 52:29.482
...who offed Veronica Dexter?

52:29.607 --> 52:31.692
Remember?
With the ski masks, those dudes.

52:31.859 --> 52:33.569
Then and there, I made a decision.

52:33.778 --> 52:36.948
If it fucking killed me,
I would not stop...

52:37.323 --> 52:39.784
...until I got, like, two more Demerol.

52:40.034 --> 52:44.914
No, seriously, I was on the case.
Harry Lockhart, L.A.P.I.

53:03.683 --> 53:05.226
- I got it.
- What do you got?

53:05.476 --> 53:08.521
Just now. My friend Tiff
does the video dubbing at Fox.

53:10.022 --> 53:13.192
- "Lord of the Cock Rings. "
- No, Harry, it's a fake label.

53:13.401 --> 53:16.904
Copyright infringement, she'd get fired.
It's a Jonny Gossamer movie.

53:17.155 --> 53:21.200
If Jenna was hunting her mystery dad,
this is where she would start, right?

53:21.450 --> 53:23.286
- Jesus, don't patronize me!
- I'm not.

53:23.536 --> 53:27.290
- You're patronizing me.
- No, I'm not. It's just a funny little buzz.

53:27.456 --> 53:29.959
I don't know if this guy's
your boyfriend or not...

53:30.084 --> 53:33.004
...but when you were in the bathroom,
he was checking me out.

53:33.212 --> 53:37.425
What? What is it out here
with these women?

53:37.717 --> 53:40.094
Please, they're no different
from anywhere else.

53:40.261 --> 53:44.056
They are. These are damaged goods,
every one of them, from way back.

53:44.223 --> 53:47.602
Take a guy who sleeps with 100 women
a year, go into his childhood...

53:47.810 --> 53:50.396
...dollars to doughnuts,
it's relatively unspectacular.

53:50.521 --> 53:53.941
Now, you take one of these gals
who sleeps with 100 guys a year...

53:54.108 --> 53:56.777
...and I bet you
if you look in their childhood...

53:56.944 --> 53:58.946
...there's something rotten in Denver.

53:59.155 --> 54:01.240
- Denmark.
- That too. But it's abandonment...

54:01.491 --> 54:04.410
...it's abuse. It's, "My uncle
put his ping-ping in my papa. "

54:04.577 --> 54:05.786
Then they all come out here.

54:06.078 --> 54:09.081
It's like someone took America
by the East Coast and shook it...

54:09.290 --> 54:11.501
...and all the normal girls
managed to hang on.

54:11.626 --> 54:15.505
Okay, everybody who hates Harry
here raise their hand.

54:16.672 --> 54:20.551
- See that? Obedient little bitches too.
- Fuck you!

54:20.760 --> 54:22.094
Hey.

54:22.303 --> 54:25.973
Okay, you've got 30 of my
fucking seconds, thrill me.

54:27.934 --> 54:29.310
All right, guys, cast list.

54:29.519 --> 54:32.063
Catch. That's the credit card
my sister used to hire you.

54:33.606 --> 54:35.566
So who's in this cinematic milestone?

54:35.775 --> 54:40.571
- We got a Michael Beck, whoever that is.
- He's the star of Xanadu, with...

54:40.780 --> 54:43.199
- ...Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly.
- Gay.

54:44.325 --> 54:45.660
- What?
- Nothing.

54:45.827 --> 54:49.205
Perry, listen up. I know this is
a long shot, but indulge me, please.

54:49.330 --> 54:51.666
We gotta lose the hat.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't-

54:51.958 --> 54:54.126
- God, I'm working!
- I know, but just forget it.

54:54.335 --> 54:58.089
Seriously, don't jump all over me.
Just pay attention. Watch it, please.

54:58.297 --> 54:59.632
- That's Harlan Dexter.
- What?

54:59.882 --> 55:02.134
- Who's Har-? What?
- Look, that's-

55:02.343 --> 55:04.971
He's 20 years younger,
but that's Harlan Dexter.

55:05.179 --> 55:07.348
Always sees the inside of a police van.

55:09.100 --> 55:10.393
No way.

55:12.395 --> 55:15.481
This kind of makes sense. He had
the Gossamer books at his house.

55:15.731 --> 55:16.941
Used to be an actor.

55:17.275 --> 55:20.611
I remember him now. 1980.
Oh, my God, I saw him like this.

55:20.820 --> 55:22.780
- Young.
- Where?

55:22.947 --> 55:25.491
In Indiana. He was there
with the movie crew.

55:25.616 --> 55:29.745
Remember, I told you he looked familiar.
Oh, God, this can't be true.

55:30.329 --> 55:34.500
And your sister has to have seen this,
so you know what it comes down to.

55:34.625 --> 55:37.461
You tell your sister a fairy tale
about her real father-

55:37.712 --> 55:41.257
And 20 years later, she comes out
to L.A. hunting Harlan Dexter.

55:44.594 --> 55:47.263
I've got a surveillance
in MacArthur Park.

55:47.513 --> 55:51.225
I gotta follow some chick around
till midnight. Do not play detective.

55:51.475 --> 55:53.436
This is not a book. This is not a movie.

55:53.686 --> 55:55.438
We got it. Do you think I'm stupid?

55:55.646 --> 55:57.732
You wouldn't know where
to feed yourself...

55:57.940 --> 56:02.820
...if you didn't flap your mouth so much.
Yes, I think you're stupid.

56:03.779 --> 56:07.533
Harry, don't listen to a word he says,
all right? We're getting somewhere.

56:07.700 --> 56:10.036
I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm going back to work.

56:10.244 --> 56:11.204
Good.

56:27.970 --> 56:30.681
- Excuse me.
- What's up, baby? How you feeling?

56:30.890 --> 56:33.601
- I'm just gonna-
- Come and take a walk. Walk with me.

56:33.809 --> 56:35.895
Great, this is fucking rich.

56:37.647 --> 56:40.274
Well, now, here we all are:

56:40.483 --> 56:44.320
- Ike, Mike and Mustard.
- What the hell does that mean?

56:44.570 --> 56:47.365
I'm with him on this one.
That's pretty fucking obscure.

56:47.573 --> 56:49.450
- I hear that all the time.
- You do?

56:49.659 --> 56:51.786
- Yeah, sure.
- Where? At the 1942 Club?

56:51.953 --> 56:55.998
- Just because you didn't get it-
- Motherfucker, I could- Slow your roll.

56:56.249 --> 56:59.460
This is bullshit. What will you do,
take me out here? There's sec-

56:59.627 --> 57:02.672
- Keep talking. Keep talking.
- You wanna know who we are?

57:02.922 --> 57:05.591
I'm the frying pan, see?
And my boy over here-

57:05.842 --> 57:08.386
He's Mustard.
I'm Mustard, baby.

57:08.636 --> 57:10.012
- Sure.
- He's the fire.

57:10.179 --> 57:13.182
- Fuck you, Mr. Mustard.
- Here we go.

57:13.432 --> 57:16.686
Now, me and my man, we're puzzled
lately by your behavior, such as-

57:16.853 --> 57:22.692
Such as why is a savvy, stand-up cat
like yourself consorting with gay men?

57:23.901 --> 57:26.362
Frolicking in the lake together.
What is that?

57:26.571 --> 57:28.739
You're the guys
who were wearing the masks.

57:28.906 --> 57:32.201
- You don't ask the questions.
- Don't ask questions.

57:32.410 --> 57:35.705
God, you just tore up my fucking
finger! I just got this fixed. Jesus!

57:35.955 --> 57:38.791
I bet there's a doctor in New York,
clear that shit right up.

57:38.958 --> 57:40.501
Clear it right up.

57:45.423 --> 57:48.134
L.A. don't want you no more,
tough guy.

57:48.676 --> 57:50.219
All right?

57:51.888 --> 57:54.515
- How much further to the hospital?
- Five minutes away.

57:54.724 --> 57:57.560
Talk to me. Our mascot,
back in high school, who was it?

57:57.977 --> 57:59.937
Come on, Harry, stay with me.

58:01.731 --> 58:03.399
Whitey, the white knight. Whitey.

58:03.566 --> 58:05.776
I guess it's better
than calling him "Knighty. "

58:05.943 --> 58:09.655
Then it'd be Knighty Knight. Soon
it'd be Toodles, and then Ta-Ta.

58:09.780 --> 58:13.409
- It's very emasculating.
- Harry, that's them. Twelve o'clock.

58:13.993 --> 58:16.204
You said it's a black guy
and a white guy?

58:16.412 --> 58:18.414
You're right.
Get the plate, call the cops.

58:18.539 --> 58:21.584
- Let me find a pen.
- No. Whatever. Watch the road.

58:21.834 --> 58:23.294
Are we slowing down?

58:23.461 --> 58:26.464
- No, I'm getting a pen.
- Are you following them? Better not be.

58:26.839 --> 58:30.343
- Tell me you're not following them.
- I'm taking you to the hospital.

58:30.593 --> 58:33.596
- Oh, shit. They're turning.
- What?

58:33.846 --> 58:35.097
Holy shit.

58:36.516 --> 58:40.686
Perry's stakeout. It's a setup. They're
going to MacArthur Park after Perry!

58:40.812 --> 58:43.856
Wait a second! My finger's hanging off.
We gotta move on this.

58:43.981 --> 58:46.776
We're gonna go save Perry,
really quickly.

58:46.901 --> 58:48.528
Then we'll go fix your finger.

58:48.736 --> 58:52.365
It'll be like, "Hey, Perry, look out. "
Boom, back in the car. All right?

58:52.615 --> 58:55.535
- Cool?
- Yeah. This is exhausting.

58:56.452 --> 58:59.163
Bingo. All right. All right, Harry.

58:59.372 --> 59:02.500
Twelve o'clock, that's them.
One of them is on foot.

59:06.504 --> 59:11.133
God, Harry. Shit, if I leave the keys,
can you take yourself to the hospital?

59:11.342 --> 59:12.927
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- All right, good.

59:13.135 --> 59:15.555
- I got the gun you gave me.
- You what?

01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:14.113
Perry!

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.366
Now, where you going?

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.206
No, no, no. Don't fight it.

01:00:24.373 --> 01:00:26.459
Let it happen, baby.

01:01:00.326 --> 01:01:02.078
Perry!

01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:11.546
Perry, watch out!
Goddamn it, turn around!

01:01:22.181 --> 01:01:24.100
Son of a bitch!

01:01:31.899 --> 01:01:35.278
How about that, you fucking animals!
Goddamn cocksuckers.

01:01:58.301 --> 01:02:00.261
- Perry.
- Where the hell did you come from?

01:02:00.428 --> 01:02:02.680
- He got away.
- It's okay. You did good.

01:02:02.889 --> 01:02:06.559
- I couldn't shoot him, Perry. Oh, God.
- You did fine. You did fine.

01:02:06.726 --> 01:02:08.394
We gotta go now.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:26.245
Hello?

01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:39.175
Anyone home?

01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:47.934
Hello?

01:02:49.393 --> 01:02:54.273
Anyone home?
I got an injury problem. Hello.

01:02:54.607 --> 01:02:57.860
All right, first things first.
You've gotta ditch that car.

01:02:58.444 --> 01:03:00.363
I know, I know. I've-

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:04.784
I know you said that there was
gonna be consequences, but fuck.

01:03:05.034 --> 01:03:07.036
I saw him shot to death.

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:12.041
- I was scared.
- Look, it's okay, yeah.

01:03:13.167 --> 01:03:16.796
We can absolutely
talk about it, all right?

01:03:17.046 --> 01:03:19.298
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:03:19.507 --> 01:03:22.218
It's nothing against your boss.
I'm grateful. I just-

01:03:22.301 --> 01:03:23.719
I spoke to him.

01:03:23.886 --> 01:03:26.722
You'll never have to go through anything
like that again.

01:03:26.931 --> 01:03:28.599
I swear.

01:03:29.016 --> 01:03:31.060
Promise?

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:32.770
Yep.

01:03:42.864 --> 01:03:44.157
Who are you?

01:03:45.283 --> 01:03:47.577
Who are you?

01:03:49.453 --> 01:03:50.913
Who-?

01:04:34.582 --> 01:04:36.042
Well, hey.

01:04:39.295 --> 01:04:42.381
So you still here, huh, tough guy?

01:04:43.966 --> 01:04:45.635
Oh, you got a gun, I see.

01:04:47.261 --> 01:04:48.971
Well, damn, you are tough.

01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:40.273
Sorry.

01:05:53.703 --> 01:05:55.538
Fuck.

01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:09.051
Hey. Hey!

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.261
Sit.

01:06:18.102 --> 01:06:20.104
- Yeah? What?
- Where the hell are you?

01:06:20.313 --> 01:06:23.941
I'm with one of the kidnappers. One of
them, anyhow. I shot him. He's dead.

01:06:24.192 --> 01:06:25.443
Come here, you fuck.

01:06:25.651 --> 01:06:27.737
Wipe the place clean
and get out of there.

01:06:27.904 --> 01:06:29.489
I want to, but I can't.

01:06:29.739 --> 01:06:33.075
- So do it.
- My fingerprint's here. The dog's got it.

01:06:33.242 --> 01:06:37.413
- No one's gonna dust the fucking dog.
- He's got the finger, asshole...

01:06:37.622 --> 01:06:40.625
- ...with the print part.
- Get the finger, kill the dog, get out.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:42.835
Hang on.

01:06:43.085 --> 01:06:46.547
Shit. Well, I think...

01:06:46.839 --> 01:06:48.925
I think we're safe.

01:06:49.383 --> 01:06:50.885
Harry?

01:06:51.719 --> 01:06:55.139
- Harry?
- Hey, Perry, I shot a guy.

01:06:55.681 --> 01:06:58.100
I never did that before.

01:06:59.435 --> 01:07:01.145
Harry, listen-

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:12.740
- link to the items found
in the Silver Lake home...

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.618
...to the kidnap-murder
of socialite Veronica Dexter.

01:07:15.868 --> 01:07:18.412
Police theorize a falling out
between the kidnappers...

01:07:18.579 --> 01:07:21.707
...resulting in at least two deaths,
and possibly a third tonight.

01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:25.086
So this evening,
was it Jonny Gossamer enough for you?

01:07:25.294 --> 01:07:28.840
To tell you the truth, Jonny Gossamer
always has a way bigger ending.

01:07:29.048 --> 01:07:31.551
There's always the part
where the guy gets tortured.

01:07:31.759 --> 01:07:35.638
Yeah, tortured, sure. Then he usually
breaks free and shoots, like, 16 guys.

01:07:35.805 --> 01:07:39.225
Yeah, 16 guys. It's always 16.
That's funny.

01:07:43.437 --> 01:07:47.733
So this thing, it's over, right? They say
the kidnappers are all dead, so...

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.403
Well, Harry, I'd be lying to you
if I didn't say...

01:07:50.653 --> 01:07:53.156
...that I still didn't have
a few questions.

01:07:53.322 --> 01:07:54.866
Harmony's sister.

01:07:55.116 --> 01:07:58.327
If she stumbles on a murder plot,
why hire me to film it?

01:07:58.452 --> 01:08:01.497
- Why not simply go to the police?
- Right. And I still think...

01:08:01.622 --> 01:08:04.667
...this Veronica Dexter
father-daughter business is wanky.

01:08:04.917 --> 01:08:07.920
So the whole reconcilement thing?

01:08:08.045 --> 01:08:09.839
"Reconciliation," idiot.

01:08:09.922 --> 01:08:14.177
She comes back to the States, drops
the lawsuit, moves in with her father.

01:08:14.385 --> 01:08:17.180
- Suddenly they're inseparable?
- So, what are you saying?

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.599
We're gonna, like, probe deeper?

01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:21.517
- Absolutely not.
- What?

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.895
What are you talking about?
My sister paid you.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.272
- What, you're gonna bail?
- Harmony...

01:08:26.397 --> 01:08:28.691
...do you want your sister's
money back? Done.

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:31.277
In the meantime, back off.

01:08:31.527 --> 01:08:33.362
Before you get me and Harry killed.

01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:49.212
Pardon me.

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.631
Hey, I lucked out.
They gave me the same room.

01:08:51.839 --> 01:08:54.216
- Lucky you.
- It's pretty good. You wanna come up?

01:08:54.425 --> 01:08:57.345
No, I don't wanna come up.
Why would I go up there?

01:08:57.553 --> 01:09:00.348
- They cleaned it.
- The car is coming. I'm going. Jesus.

01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:07.020
You know what, Harry? Stop.

01:09:08.397 --> 01:09:10.316
Why'd you lie to me?

01:09:12.693 --> 01:09:16.154
It was an excuse to stay around you.
So I think, in the realm of lies-

01:09:16.447 --> 01:09:17.990
You are such a dumb-ass.

01:09:19.742 --> 01:09:23.246
- I am so not who you think I am, Harry.
- And who would that be?

01:09:23.328 --> 01:09:26.040
You think I'm- You think I'm amazing.

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:28.751
You do. You think I'm so amazing...

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.920
...because that's who
I told you I'd be.

01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:32.712
Yeah, that was the game plan.

01:09:32.921 --> 01:09:35.633
- You know what? It worked.
- No one else thinks so.

01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:39.095
- My opinion doesn't count?
- No, it doesn't.

01:09:39.345 --> 01:09:40.763
Because you're new here.

01:09:40.846 --> 01:09:42.849
Look around,
there's younger and better.

01:09:43.015 --> 01:09:45.434
I don't want younger and better,
I want you.

01:09:45.643 --> 01:09:47.854
I'm such a moron. I'm sorry.
You know what-

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.939
- It doesn't matter, I'm going. Look, just-
- I'm such an idiot.

01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:57.196
I steal shit.

01:09:59.782 --> 01:10:02.034
- Come again?
- That's what I do for a living.

01:10:02.118 --> 01:10:03.828
I steal audio-visual components.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.456
I steal. I robbed a house.
I stole this watch.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.377
It's a cool watch. It's got this
little light thing. I stole this gum...

01:10:11.711 --> 01:10:15.131
...from the lobby,
because it was kind of a rush.

01:10:15.339 --> 01:10:20.678
I've never finished anything
that I've started my entire life.

01:10:22.138 --> 01:10:24.974
Not school, not marriage, nothing.

01:10:25.683 --> 01:10:29.103
And I have this thing where,
like halfway in the middle, I just...

01:10:29.187 --> 01:10:30.980
...and I cut and run.

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:34.233
Like the other night
when you were all over me...

01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:36.527
...and you gave up
and just went for it with-

01:10:36.736 --> 01:10:40.406
Prime example. I switched to the ugly
friend. Homely friend. She's not ugly.

01:10:40.573 --> 01:10:42.742
She's homely.

01:10:44.327 --> 01:10:47.580
Don't go. Please.

01:10:47.747 --> 01:10:49.457
Not yet.

01:10:49.624 --> 01:10:51.250
This isn't finished.

01:11:00.092 --> 01:11:01.385
- Turn around.
- Why?

01:11:01.552 --> 01:11:04.222
- Just turn around.
- What, my tag's out?

01:11:04.472 --> 01:11:07.934
- This dump have a bar?
- Yeah.

01:11:08.184 --> 01:11:11.103
- Call me "Slick" from here on out.
- That was such a good job.

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.231
You snagged a ton of gum.

01:11:13.439 --> 01:11:16.442
- I mean, petty theft-
- Oh, Harry.

01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:20.613
I really didn't need
that last shot of tequila.

01:11:20.738 --> 01:11:23.741
Oh, God.

01:11:37.213 --> 01:11:39.465
I just had a weird thought.

01:11:39.715 --> 01:11:43.344
Veronica Dexter. I saw the body
up close. Hell, I carried the damn thing.

01:11:43.553 --> 01:11:46.889
Both times, the dress was soaked
through, so it was transparent. So-

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.642
God, Harry,
where are you going with this?

01:11:49.934 --> 01:11:51.894
No, no, no. It's just-

01:11:52.562 --> 01:11:55.481
Perry said this chick was deep
into the born-again bit...

01:11:55.690 --> 01:12:00.862
...so it's probably nothing,
but just if she had on underwear...

01:12:01.612 --> 01:12:04.782
...I didn't see any.

01:12:07.034 --> 01:12:10.496
- I guess I'm taking the couch.
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:12:10.621 --> 01:12:15.168
Or you can sleep here.
But it would only be sleeping, Harry.

01:12:17.128 --> 01:12:19.964
If that's gonna frustrate you.

01:12:20.548 --> 01:12:22.425
Let's see.

01:12:29.765 --> 01:12:32.143
Oh, Harry.

01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:36.063
So long ago.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:42.612
Didn't really turn out
the way we hoped, did it?

01:12:43.529 --> 01:12:49.452
I guess if I racked my brain,
I could think of worse places to be.

01:12:51.871 --> 01:12:55.583
- Is that so, Whitey?
- Whitey?

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:58.044
- Calling me a knight?
- Maybe, yeah.

01:12:58.127 --> 01:13:01.130
Except for the boner.
That's not too knightly.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:04.467
The hell it isn't.
Actually, it's nightly and most mornings.

01:13:11.057 --> 01:13:12.934
Fuck it, I'm not a knight. I'm sorry.

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.645
I'm thinking-
I'm going nuts, so I think maybe...

01:13:15.853 --> 01:13:18.022
- ...the couch is good.
- What? Stop. Harry.

01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:20.316
Or I can keep drinking
until it goes away.

01:13:20.441 --> 01:13:22.902
Harry, seriously,
if you're at all uncomfortable...

01:13:23.152 --> 01:13:25.363
...I am more than happy
to do something.

01:13:25.655 --> 01:13:27.114
- For chrissake, no.
- Why not?

01:13:27.323 --> 01:13:30.326
I don't want you to offer it as-
Not, "It's a courtesy freebie. "

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.620
- You're so anal.
- I don't want the backup:

01:13:32.787 --> 01:13:35.790
"Let me just give you a hand here"...

01:13:35.873 --> 01:13:41.295
...as a kind of, like,
default backup thing.

01:14:01.858 --> 01:14:05.027
You're gonna stop calling me.

01:14:05.278 --> 01:14:07.071
No. You know, that's crazy.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.031
I swear to God, this is it.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.784
You are the dream girl.
You always have been.

01:14:11.951 --> 01:14:14.453
This is destiny.

01:14:14.954 --> 01:14:16.873
Okay.

01:14:22.044 --> 01:14:24.964
Before we do this...

01:14:25.089 --> 01:14:27.925
...I have a little confession to make.

01:14:28.843 --> 01:14:33.139
My best friend! You said you were going
to drop by his house, wave goodbye.

01:14:33.264 --> 01:14:35.808
I was leaving for L.A.
I was never gonna see him-

01:14:35.933 --> 01:14:37.602
- He looked sad.
- He looked sad?

01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:40.062
- Yes, he did.
- You slept with Chook COhutney.

01:14:40.313 --> 01:14:42.815
Fuck. For chrissake, Harry,
it was forever ago.

01:14:42.982 --> 01:14:45.193
Come on,
I was a different person back then.

01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:47.612
- You slept with Chook. Excuse me.
- Come on.

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.780
- Watch your hand.
- Harry!

01:15:30.154 --> 01:15:33.866
- Yeah.
- Harry, was she raped?

01:15:35.159 --> 01:15:37.119
The Dexter girl, was she raped?

01:15:38.204 --> 01:15:41.666
No, the ME's report showed no
indication of rape stuff.

01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:43.543
You slept with Chook COhutney.

01:16:01.435 --> 01:16:05.398
Wake up. Harry, wake up.

01:16:06.858 --> 01:16:09.152
- Get up.
- What's up?

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.737
Harmony's in trouble. Get dressed.

01:16:11.946 --> 01:16:13.656
Let's go.

01:16:15.783 --> 01:16:19.036
Perry, it's me. Listen,
this Veronica Dexter business stinks.

01:16:19.245 --> 01:16:21.455
I'm gonna go
check on something Harry said.

01:16:21.622 --> 01:16:23.624
Call me. If I'm right, you'll shit.

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.918
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

01:16:26.252 --> 01:16:29.255
- I don't get what's happening.
- She solved this thing.

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:33.843
That sly little minx of yours has solved
this case, and now I can't find her.

01:16:34.093 --> 01:16:36.053
- You're worried.
- You're not worried?

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.930
Of course. If you are, I should be.

01:16:38.139 --> 01:16:39.891
Now, what did you say? Think.

01:16:40.183 --> 01:16:43.019
- You said something about the case.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:43.352 --> 01:16:44.937
What?

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.279
I tell him about destiny.
He's shaking his head.

01:16:53.362 --> 01:16:57.325
About dream girls, he doesn't care.
I mention the underwear thing...

01:16:57.533 --> 01:16:59.118
...he has a fucking conniption.

01:16:59.285 --> 01:17:01.370
And you?
How about it, filmgoer?

01:17:03.289 --> 01:17:05.958
Have you solved the case
of the dead people in L.A.?

01:17:06.209 --> 01:17:08.711
Times Square audiences,
don't shout at the screen.

01:17:08.878 --> 01:17:11.631
And stop picking at that,
it'll just get worse.

01:17:14.217 --> 01:17:17.136
- This won't take a second.
- Right.

01:17:29.941 --> 01:17:32.652
Hi. How are you doing tonight?

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.737
They gave away my crickets.

01:17:38.866 --> 01:17:43.079
Excuse me, you wouldn't, by chance,
happen to have seen this woman?

01:17:43.204 --> 01:17:47.083
No. I don't like him.
Kurt Cobain, he took my cricket.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.668
Of course. That's sad.

01:17:48.835 --> 01:17:52.171
Ma'am, I hope you won't be offended
when I ask you...

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.842
...if you're wearing anything at all
underneath your hospital blues.

01:17:56.008 --> 01:17:59.679
Any undergarments. It's important.

01:18:12.608 --> 01:18:15.111
That's the clue.
Veronica Dexter was a patient here.

01:18:15.319 --> 01:18:18.739
Private mental clinic,
where even nice girls don't wear undies.

01:18:19.073 --> 01:18:22.076
How could she be here and meanwhile,
she's out having parties?

01:18:22.285 --> 01:18:26.455
Think. First she hates her dad, then loves
him. Has a lawsuit, withdraws it. Why?

01:18:26.664 --> 01:18:28.958
- I'll tell you why.
- Oh, my God.

01:18:32.837 --> 01:18:35.214
Oh, my God.
So it's two different girls, right?

01:18:35.423 --> 01:18:38.968
He stashed his daughter in here,
and then he put the ringer on the street.

01:18:39.218 --> 01:18:42.305
He needs someone who looks like her
to withdraw the complaint.

01:18:42.847 --> 01:18:44.640
- It's been 10 years.
- This is nuts.

01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:47.185
- It's right out of a Gossamer book.
- Of course...

01:18:47.435 --> 01:18:50.188
...because the guy who planned
the crimes has all the books.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.901
He's read them all. They're in his house.
Plus, he was in that piece of shit...

01:18:55.151 --> 01:18:56.903
...movie.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.739
You're telling me the girl imposter-

01:18:59.906 --> 01:19:02.158
A desperate man needs
a replacement daughter.

01:19:02.325 --> 01:19:04.327
Along comes a girl, Harmony's sister.

01:19:04.535 --> 01:19:08.289
- Fresh off the bus, looking for her dad.
- I'd say I found my imposter.

01:19:08.498 --> 01:19:10.541
Let's get out of here.

01:19:12.543 --> 01:19:15.463
- So where did she go from here?
- Shut up, I'm thinking.

01:19:15.796 --> 01:19:17.173
By the way, this thing:

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.300
Single gayest thing you've ever done.

01:19:19.509 --> 01:19:22.470
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Hi, we are so incredibly lost.

01:19:22.678 --> 01:19:24.305
Mr. Van Shrike, hello.

01:19:24.555 --> 01:19:26.849
You look chilly. Come back inside.

01:19:27.058 --> 01:19:29.560
I'm from back East.
I'm kind of digging the cold.

01:19:29.769 --> 01:19:33.606
- Fuck! He's the one who said it.
- Or I can kill you here.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.905
Harry, I was thinking some more
about this reality versus fiction.

01:19:40.988 --> 01:19:45.952
Like in the movies, when a guy sticks
a gun at some schmuck's back and says:

01:19:46.118 --> 01:19:49.288
- "Let's take a walk. " He's got a hostage.
- I've seen that movie.

01:19:49.455 --> 01:19:52.917
In reality, the pros like about
five feet of separation.

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:56.963
That's so the schmuck doesn't take
the gun back and make him eat it.

01:19:59.882 --> 01:20:02.343
Doesn't that suck?
I just hit you for no reason.

01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:04.804
Watch it.

01:20:10.017 --> 01:20:12.728
- Tell us where Harmony is.
- Fuck you, Mary.

01:20:12.937 --> 01:20:15.940
You don't get it, do you?
This isn't "good cop, bad cop. "

01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:19.819
This is fag and New Yorker.
You're in a lot of trouble.

01:20:19.986 --> 01:20:24.532
For chrissake, who are you protecting?
It's all over. Dexter is going down.

01:20:24.782 --> 01:20:26.993
- Down.
- I know about Veronica's lawsuit.

01:20:27.201 --> 01:20:30.454
I know Dexter was facing ruin.
I even know he switched daughters.

01:20:30.621 --> 01:20:34.000
Which, for God's sake, actually
did work for a while, till last week.

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:36.836
- Then he had to kill her, huh?
- Put a sock in it.

01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:39.338
- I'm asking a question.
- If you ask questions...

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.133
...then it seems like
we don't know anything. Okay?

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.178
And for the record, it was the boyfriend,
the guy from Paris.

01:20:45.428 --> 01:20:49.015
He would've spotted the fake and said,
"That's not Veronica. " Am I right?

01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:51.267
- Fuck you!
- Exactly.

01:20:51.517 --> 01:20:54.061
So Dexter had Veronica killed,
threw a dress on her...

01:20:54.312 --> 01:20:57.773
...dumped the body and walked away
clean, except for one little thing.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.194
- Underpants.
- One tiny little pair of undies.

01:21:01.444 --> 01:21:02.820
Yeah.

01:21:03.779 --> 01:21:07.033
You think that's funny, huh?
I'm gonna break your nose now.

01:21:07.575 --> 01:21:11.204
I want you to picture a bullet inside
your head. Can you do that for me?

01:21:11.454 --> 01:21:13.289
Fuck you.

01:21:13.414 --> 01:21:16.209
- Anyway, that's ambiguous.
- Ambiguous? I don't think so.

01:21:16.334 --> 01:21:18.961
He means when you say,
"Picture it inside your head"...

01:21:19.128 --> 01:21:21.380
...is that "a bullet
will be inside your head"...

01:21:21.631 --> 01:21:24.425
- ...or "picture it in your head"?
- Harry, will you shut up.

01:21:24.675 --> 01:21:27.804
I don't know anything about a girl,
seriously. I was bluffing.

01:21:28.012 --> 01:21:32.266
- I think that you are bluffing right now.
- Harry, what are you doing?

01:21:32.391 --> 01:21:34.685
What I'm doing for the guy
who likes to bluff...

01:21:34.894 --> 01:21:40.316
...is I'm playing a little game called
"Am I Bluffing?" Where is she?

01:21:40.525 --> 01:21:43.152
Where the fuck is Harmony?
You want to play hardball?

01:21:43.319 --> 01:21:46.072
Where is the girl?

01:21:46.572 --> 01:21:48.157
What did you just do?

01:21:48.449 --> 01:21:51.911
- I just put in one bullet, didn't I?
- You put a live round in that gun?

01:21:51.994 --> 01:21:54.747
Yeah, there was like
an 8 percent chance.

01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:58.543
- Eight? Who taught you math?
- Maybe it was more. I don't know-

01:21:59.168 --> 01:22:00.962
Shit!

01:22:01.546 --> 01:22:03.548
- Hello?
- Perry, is that you?

01:22:03.756 --> 01:22:05.758
- Hey, it's me.
- Hi, Harmony.

01:22:05.967 --> 01:22:07.760
- What's going on?
- Where are you?

01:22:07.844 --> 01:22:09.345
- At home.
- You're at home?

01:22:09.512 --> 01:22:12.515
I just got back. I was in the Hills
all day. Shitty reception.

01:22:12.765 --> 01:22:16.060
- You don't sound so good.
- Why aren't you following your lead?

01:22:16.227 --> 01:22:18.271
Oh, forget it. It's just crazy.

01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:20.356
No, it's not crazy. Listen-

01:22:20.565 --> 01:22:23.860
- It's right out of a Gossamer book.
- Don't talk. Listen.

01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:26.279
- Eight percent.
- And you, stop multiplying.

01:22:26.529 --> 01:22:29.198
No, not you. Listen, call downtown...

01:22:29.323 --> 01:22:32.118
...see if Veronica Dexter's body
has gone to the mortuary.

01:22:32.326 --> 01:22:34.620
If it has, see if there's
a cremation scheduled.

01:22:34.829 --> 01:22:37.999
- Wait, Perry.
- Call me back right away.

01:22:40.543 --> 01:22:43.379
Look, he was gonna kill you anyway.
He said so.

01:22:47.258 --> 01:22:49.010
Cover him up. I'll get the car.

01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:54.682
- All right, that's pretty much all done.
- Harry-

01:22:54.891 --> 01:22:59.979
I got an idea. I say we take
the son of a bitch Dexter down.

01:23:01.522 --> 01:23:05.485
To the racetrack and buy
the son of a gun a drink.

01:23:05.693 --> 01:23:10.323
What do you say, Perry?
Oh, fuck, no fair. No fucking fair.

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:13.701
Aurelio, give Mr. Van Shrike
a little pat down.

01:23:21.792 --> 01:23:24.253
Fucking maricón.

01:23:27.715 --> 01:23:30.218
Toss it here. Let's see who it is.

01:23:32.386 --> 01:23:34.096
We're in trouble. Dexter's got us.

01:23:38.768 --> 01:23:41.229
He just asked a carpet-cleaning service
to save him.

01:23:41.896 --> 01:23:44.273
Sorry, kid. Good hands, though.

01:23:44.524 --> 01:23:47.527
Thanks. Used to be a magician.

01:23:48.152 --> 01:23:52.615
And for 39.99 we'll carpet
up to three rooms in half the time.

01:23:52.824 --> 01:23:56.285
That's a $40 value. Act today.

01:23:59.413 --> 01:24:02.500
That chick in the casket,
she won't even match up with that...

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:05.795
...ringer you been toting around.
You ever think about that?

01:24:05.962 --> 01:24:08.548
He did, Harry.
That's why he's cremating the body.

01:24:10.133 --> 01:24:11.717
Yeah, you ready?

01:24:13.427 --> 01:24:16.347
Speak of the devil. Gotta go.

01:24:16.597 --> 01:24:20.143
Perry, nice to have known you.

01:24:20.893 --> 01:24:22.478
- Harry.
- Harry. Yes, of course.

01:24:22.645 --> 01:24:23.980
Harry from New York.

01:24:24.188 --> 01:24:28.401
I hope you don't judge Los Angeles
based solely on your experience tonight.

01:24:36.117 --> 01:24:38.786
I'm kind of scared here, Perry.

01:24:39.036 --> 01:24:41.330
Aurelio, why don't you give
the kid a break?

01:24:41.539 --> 01:24:44.041
Do unto others and all that.
It's Christmas.

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:46.419
- Who else knows?
- I don't know anything.

01:24:46.627 --> 01:24:48.838
I'm not even from here, you fuck-up.

01:25:01.559 --> 01:25:03.644
Mr. Dexter, the coffin's good to go.

01:25:03.853 --> 01:25:06.439
Okay, let's burn the bitch.

01:25:09.484 --> 01:25:11.444
You could zap his chest.
It'd be easier.

01:25:11.777 --> 01:25:13.779
But we know why you gotta do
it down there.

01:25:13.821 --> 01:25:16.032
You like looking at his johnson,
don't you?

01:25:16.282 --> 01:25:18.034
Admit it, dude, you got it in you.

01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:25.875
Enough! Look me in the eyes and
tell me you've never been with a man.

01:25:26.167 --> 01:25:29.295
- Fuck you, maricón! Fuck you!
- That's what you want, isn't it?

01:25:29.462 --> 01:25:32.632
- You want to fuck me.
- Stop helping. Stop helping.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.551
- If you are not gay, just say so.
- Fuck you, maricón!

01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:39.639
- Look at him. He can't even say it.
- Stop helping!

01:25:39.931 --> 01:25:42.433
- Can't wait to have you as a patient.
- Bet you can't.

01:25:42.642 --> 01:25:44.644
- This is what you want. Here.
- Shut up!

01:25:44.811 --> 01:25:47.772
Take a look. You want some of this
right here? Look at this.

01:25:48.022 --> 01:25:49.232
Just shut up!

01:25:53.027 --> 01:25:54.612
Yeah!

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.700
Homophobes never check there.

01:26:01.494 --> 01:26:04.831
Thank God you had a gun in there.
I thought it was a gay thing...

01:26:05.164 --> 01:26:07.875
...like somehow
you guys could do that. Sorry.

01:26:08.084 --> 01:26:11.087
- Are you okay?
- Not really, no.

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.006
Gentlemen, let's wrap it up
and get out of here.

01:26:16.384 --> 01:26:19.637
- Who's driving?
- I tell you what, I'll flip you for it.

01:26:19.762 --> 01:26:21.639
All right.

01:26:26.185 --> 01:26:28.062
- This way, come on.
- Shit!

01:26:34.235 --> 01:26:36.654
- Yeah.
- Hey, Harmony, it's me.

01:26:36.821 --> 01:26:38.823
Oh, God, how did you get away?

01:26:39.031 --> 01:26:41.742
I shot him with a small revolver
I keep near my balls.

01:26:41.993 --> 01:26:45.663
I can't get to my car. We're near Olive
and the freeway. Can you pick us up?

01:26:45.955 --> 01:26:48.708
I'm in a van with the body.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

01:26:48.958 --> 01:26:51.627
All right, be where I can see you.
Be ready to move.

01:26:53.004 --> 01:26:56.799
Shit, they're on my tail. I gotta go.

01:27:07.727 --> 01:27:11.272
Right there. She's right there! Shit.

01:27:18.779 --> 01:27:20.448
Harmony!

01:27:37.757 --> 01:27:39.842
Harmony!

01:27:55.483 --> 01:27:57.360
- Harmony!
- Harry, don't!

01:28:26.139 --> 01:28:29.976
Come on, we gotta go. They're coming
back around. Harmony's down there.

01:28:32.395 --> 01:28:35.815
Perry, what's wrong?

01:28:37.275 --> 01:28:39.277
Come on, breathe.

01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:56.043
Harry.

01:29:02.091 --> 01:29:03.801
Harold.

01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:30.036
Harold...

01:29:30.369 --> 01:29:33.664
...use your awesome might.

01:29:33.915 --> 01:29:37.376
Save me from this hopeless plight.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.506
Harold...

01:30:31.973 --> 01:30:33.474
Harmony!

01:30:46.028 --> 01:30:49.699
Captain Fucking Magic.

01:30:55.538 --> 01:30:56.914
Come on!

01:31:09.218 --> 01:31:10.553
No.

01:31:18.603 --> 01:31:21.522
There, all done.

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:24.734
Finished.

01:31:34.243 --> 01:31:35.786
Harry.

01:31:38.331 --> 01:31:41.751
- Did you call me?
- Harry, you're shot.

01:31:41.959 --> 01:31:44.337
No, no. Look, you want
to see something cool?

01:31:47.089 --> 01:31:50.718
Cool! This stopped the bullet, Harry.

01:31:58.017 --> 01:32:00.144
No, not really.

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.605
Oh, Harry.

01:32:02.814 --> 01:32:05.441
Oh, God, Harry.

01:32:08.361 --> 01:32:09.987
Harry.

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:24.085
- Hi. Welcome back.
- Yeah.

01:32:26.045 --> 01:32:29.632
- How many fingers?
- Put that cat down, because I'm allergic.

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.970
You feeling okay? How's your...?

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:36.472
- My what?
- Well, your...

01:32:36.722 --> 01:32:40.184
- Everything down there.
- I can't believe he told you that.

01:32:42.728 --> 01:32:44.814
It's Christmas,
where's my present, Slick?

01:32:45.022 --> 01:32:47.233
Your present is you're not in jail,
fag-hag.

01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:50.236
Yeah, boo, hiss, I know.
Look, I hate it too.

01:32:50.361 --> 01:32:53.781
In movies where the studio gets all
paranoid about a downer ending...

01:32:53.948 --> 01:32:57.827
...so the guy shows up, he's magically
alive on crutches, I hate that.

01:32:58.077 --> 01:33:01.080
I mean, shit,
why not bring them all back.

01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:06.085
But the point is, in this case,
this time, it really happened.

01:33:06.335 --> 01:33:08.838
Perry, like, lived.
Yeah, it's a dumb movie thing...

01:33:09.005 --> 01:33:11.632
...but what do you want me to do,
lie about it?

01:33:11.841 --> 01:33:13.593
So you found something out?

01:33:13.843 --> 01:33:16.929
Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.

01:33:18.514 --> 01:33:20.516
Dexter didn't murder your sister.

01:33:21.434 --> 01:33:25.396
That's crazy. He was using my sister
to impersonate his daughter, Perry.

01:33:25.605 --> 01:33:28.191
Never happened.
I talked to my police guy.

01:33:29.692 --> 01:33:35.781
The ringer was a girl named Mia Frye,
23-year-old from Glendale.

01:33:36.032 --> 01:33:38.451
When she wasn't impersonating
Veronica Dexter...

01:33:38.618 --> 01:33:40.786
...she wore a pink wig.

01:33:42.914 --> 01:33:47.293
But my sister sent you up
to Big Bear Lake, to his cabin.

01:33:48.878 --> 01:33:52.799
Your sister was convinced
that Dexter was her natural father...

01:33:53.049 --> 01:33:55.551
...so she started following him,
hanging around.

01:33:55.718 --> 01:33:58.221
Do you see where I'm going with this?

01:33:58.638 --> 01:34:01.557
One day your sister came calling,
and she saw Dexter...

01:34:01.808 --> 01:34:03.643
...in bed with the pink-haired girl.

01:34:03.893 --> 01:34:06.562
What she thought
was father and daughter.

01:34:06.687 --> 01:34:08.940
Remember,
that's how it would appear.

01:34:09.148 --> 01:34:10.566
It was too much for her.

01:34:10.733 --> 01:34:15.154
First the old father,
now the shiny new one.

01:34:15.321 --> 01:34:20.326
She couldn't handle it,
and she took her own life.

01:34:20.993 --> 01:34:24.914
What she hired me to film
wasn't murder, but incest.

01:34:27.416 --> 01:34:29.460
I'm sorry.

01:34:29.585 --> 01:34:31.546
So much for unreality.

01:34:31.838 --> 01:34:33.256
I said goodbye...

01:34:33.673 --> 01:34:37.260
...watched Jonny's world
go back on the fiction shelf.

01:34:37.385 --> 01:34:40.054
But while it lasted, brother...

01:34:40.888 --> 01:34:42.849
...it was one for the books.

01:34:44.183 --> 01:34:46.727
You should've told me
you were arrested five times.

01:34:47.436 --> 01:34:48.980
I should be pissed.

01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:52.859
You should have told me that when you
go home, you put on lady's underpants.

01:34:52.942 --> 01:34:55.027
- That's cross-dressing, imbecile.
- Whatever.

01:34:55.278 --> 01:34:58.906
Half those guys are straight.
Perfect fathers, love their kids.

01:34:59.115 --> 01:35:01.200
How about you?
Did your father love you?

01:35:01.325 --> 01:35:05.371
Sometimes. You know, when I dressed
up like a bottle. How about yours?

01:35:05.496 --> 01:35:08.499
Well, he used to beat me in Morse code,
so it's possible...

01:35:08.666 --> 01:35:11.127
...but he never
actually said the words.

01:35:11.335 --> 01:35:13.504
- Harry.
- What?

01:35:13.713 --> 01:35:16.048
Don't steal any more shit.

01:35:17.049 --> 01:35:19.051
You're not a punk.

01:35:22.805 --> 01:35:23.973
You bet I'll turn around.

01:35:24.348 --> 01:35:25.641
You like that, huh?

01:35:25.808 --> 01:35:29.103
I saw him in the commissary twice.
What is he, like 6'4"?

01:35:29.395 --> 01:35:32.482
He doesn't know he's gay.
Look how he walks.

01:35:32.732 --> 01:35:34.275
So that's pretty much that.

01:35:34.484 --> 01:35:37.403
We went back to Indiana,
the three of us, for Jenna's funeral.

01:35:39.071 --> 01:35:41.240
Don't worry,
I saw the last Lord of the Rings.

01:35:41.491 --> 01:35:43.242
I won't have the movie end 17 times.

01:35:43.451 --> 01:35:46.245
There is, though, one final scene
for your viewing pleasure.

01:35:55.963 --> 01:35:57.924
Do I know you?

01:36:02.094 --> 01:36:04.597
No. Just in town for the funeral.

01:36:05.139 --> 01:36:06.516
What do you want?

01:36:06.682 --> 01:36:10.770
The zoo was closed, so I thought
I'd come here and look at an animal.

01:36:10.978 --> 01:36:12.522
Son of a-

01:36:12.647 --> 01:36:15.441
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:36:15.691 --> 01:36:17.902
I buried my daughter today.

01:36:18.194 --> 01:36:20.279
No.

01:36:20.696 --> 01:36:23.616
You buried her 20 years ago.

01:36:23.741 --> 01:36:27.745
Harmony was right,
her sister was murdered.

01:36:27.954 --> 01:36:31.958
You pulled the trigger. It just took
this long for the bullet to hit.

01:36:32.875 --> 01:36:35.044
Who are you?

01:36:36.129 --> 01:36:37.964
I loved my girl.

01:36:38.923 --> 01:36:42.343
You fucker!
If I could get out of this bed-

01:36:42.552 --> 01:36:45.888
Yeah? Well, you can't.

01:36:46.848 --> 01:36:49.183
You bastard!

01:36:52.687 --> 01:36:55.148
An old man that can't defend himself.

01:36:55.398 --> 01:36:57.275
Big tough guy.

01:36:57.483 --> 01:36:58.734
Yeah, that's right.

01:37:00.403 --> 01:37:02.572
Big tough guy.

01:37:16.335 --> 01:37:21.549
I prefer Genaros, but what do I know?
I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.

01:37:29.932 --> 01:37:33.686
That's it. That's the true story
of what happened last Christmas.

01:37:33.895 --> 01:37:37.565
That was some pretty harsh shit
with the old guy back there, right?

01:37:37.732 --> 01:37:40.693
But whatever, he's creepy.
Fuck him. Don't worry about him.

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:42.987
Anyhow, so...

01:37:43.154 --> 01:37:44.906
Thanks for coming.

01:37:44.989 --> 01:37:48.618
Thanks for taking the trip to L.A.
with me.

01:37:49.702 --> 01:37:51.621
If I had to sum it up,
and I do-

01:37:51.787 --> 01:37:54.207
Because, you know,
it's, like, the end.

01:37:54.415 --> 01:37:58.920
- I would say that this movie is about-
It's about friendship.

01:37:59.003 --> 01:38:01.255
- Friendship is sacred.
- What are you doing?

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.090
I'm trying to wrap up the movie...

01:38:03.341 --> 01:38:05.551
...and leave the people
with a message.

01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:09.555
I've got a message for you.
Get your feet off my fucking desk.

01:38:09.722 --> 01:38:11.808
Sorry. I work for Perry now.

01:38:11.974 --> 01:38:13.726
- And stop narrating.
- Obviously.

01:38:13.810 --> 01:38:16.187
That's it.
Please stay for the end credits.

01:38:16.437 --> 01:38:19.774
If you're wondering who the best boy is,
it's someone's nephew.

01:38:19.941 --> 01:38:21.818
Don't forget to validate your parking.

01:38:21.943 --> 01:38:24.195
For all of you good people
in the Midwest...

01:38:24.362 --> 01:38:25.863
...sorry we said "fuck" so much.

01:38:26.113 --> 01:38:27.865
- Say good night.
- Thanks again.

01:38:28.115 --> 01:38:29.867
Now, go. Vanish.
