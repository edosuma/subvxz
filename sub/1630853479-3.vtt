TOM SWIFT #103
"...And the Nine Inches
of Danger"
Closed Captioned

00:01.459 --> 00:04.379
I'm Tom Swift--
inventor, billionaire,

00:04.421 --> 00:06.548
shoe collector extraordinaire,

00:06.589 --> 00:08.842
but none of that
was good enough for my dad.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.802
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

00:10.844 --> 00:13.763
I could earn his love, but
his mission ended tragically.

00:13.805 --> 00:18.143
Or so I thought.
Turns out, it was sabotage.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.561
My father survived the attack

00:19.602 --> 00:21.438
and sent me a message capsule

00:21.479 --> 00:23.314
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.401
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.944
Now I have to find the pieces

00:27.986 --> 00:30.989
of that capsule
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.158
A global conspiracy called
"The Road Back"

00:33.199 --> 00:35.702
is standing in my way,
so I can only trust my squad--

00:35.744 --> 00:37.996
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

00:38.038 --> 00:40.415
my adopted brother Lino

00:40.457 --> 00:42.208
and my AI, Barclay.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.960
Together, we're going
to find my father

00:44.002 --> 00:45.670
and bring him home.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.925
(warning alarm sounds)
(Tom gasps)

00:56.389 --> 00:58.099
Oh.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.394
Okay.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.480
(panting)

01:03.521 --> 01:06.232
(elevator doors open)

01:06.274 --> 01:09.861
You good?
No. Um,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.821
last night, after I severed all

01:11.863 --> 01:14.699
of Barclay's network connections
from Swift Enterprises,

01:14.741 --> 01:18.536
I discovered that the spyware
Rowan used is a hybrid Trojan.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.705
BARCLAY:
My security protocols
are being chipped away.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.957
I'm at 90%.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.126
You should've let me handle
Rowan last night.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.128
He's giving intel
to Congressman Eskol.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.507
But instead,
you texted "You up?"

01:30.548 --> 01:31.925
as if you two matched
on a dating app.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.343
Okay, for Barclay's sake,

01:33.384 --> 01:34.844
you better hope
that Rowan swipes right.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.514
Look, there is
a bigger problem right now.

01:37.555 --> 01:41.267
How do I stop this spyware
before it reaches 100%,

01:41.309 --> 01:43.311
and all of Barclay's data
becomes accessible

01:43.353 --> 01:45.105
to the people who tried
to kill my dad?

01:45.146 --> 01:46.981
Can't you just reinstall
Barclay's database?
No.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.025
It's not that simple.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.819
Look, Barclay is an AI,
but he's...

01:52.320 --> 01:53.905
He's my memory.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.866
If I wiped and rebooted him, he
would never come back the same.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.493
Thank you, Isaac.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.663
Your suggestion
to give me a lobotomy is noted.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.959
But if Barclay's defenses
go to zero percent,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.169
they'll be able
to track the capsule pieces.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.880
If he's breached, they'll know
my father is alive,

02:10.922 --> 02:12.382
and they will come back

02:12.423 --> 02:14.384
to finish the job
before we can save him.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.804
We have to stop that breach.

to see you spend more time

04:22.845 --> 04:24.806
helping the company thrive.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.684
You'll be co-hosting
the entire summit with Claire.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.519
Who? And co-hosting? I thought

04:29.560 --> 04:31.396
I was just going
to make an appearance.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.856
This is the first summit
without your father.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.776
Now, the time has come
for you to take the reins,

04:36.818 --> 04:40.280
and it will require every minute
of your attention.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.573
CLAIRE:
Tom,

04:42.615 --> 04:44.450
you know the destruction
of Barton's ship put us

04:44.492 --> 04:46.703
in financial crisis.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.706
The summit is our best chance
to replenish what we've lost,

04:49.747 --> 04:52.333
which is why Susannah Robb
will attend this year.

04:52.959 --> 04:57.297
She's the 22-year-old
billionaire estate heiress?

04:57.338 --> 04:59.340
She's basically you
with 18 inches of extensions.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.717
Oh, yeah.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.552
She's one of our
biggest investors.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.220
And she needs
to have the time of her life,

05:04.262 --> 05:06.389
which brings us to the fact
that, apparently,

05:06.431 --> 05:08.224
the Obamas bought all
of the Léo Beau champagne

05:08.266 --> 05:09.600
in North America.
LORRAINE:
Oh!

05:09.642 --> 05:11.102
I could try
something cheaper, but...

05:11.144 --> 05:13.146
No, no, no.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.731
Stick with the cheap stuff.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.774
Tom, I'm sending you something.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.860
(trilling)

05:18.901 --> 05:20.320
Ah.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.405
This penlight design was

05:22.447 --> 05:25.408
to be Barton's next
handcrafted invention,

05:25.450 --> 05:27.618
and Tom,
you're going to build it.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.080
Barton said it could manipulate
UV light and make

05:31.122 --> 05:33.333
cheap champagne taste
like a top-shelf.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.754
I'm happy to host solo
if Tom can't...

05:37.795 --> 05:39.589
No. You can be
my helper,

05:39.630 --> 05:43.551
but we're going to show
Wall Street and Susannah Robb

05:43.593 --> 05:46.804
that Swift Enterprises
is still the HBIC.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.931
(chuckles softly)

05:48.973 --> 05:51.434
Okay, I don't know
what "BIHC" means,

05:51.476 --> 05:53.144
but Lorraine,
we are late for our 11:00.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.772
All right.
(chuckles softly)

05:59.025 --> 06:01.486
Okay, I say
you tell your mom

06:01.527 --> 06:03.446
about Uncle Barton
and The Road Back.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.449
Look, if we get my mom involved,
she could end up dead.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.951
Instead, we're going to invite
Eskol and Rowan to the summit,

06:08.993 --> 06:10.787
and I'm going
to clone Rowan's phone...

06:10.828 --> 06:12.538
so I can stop Barclay's spyware.
Uh, oh, okay.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.207
So, you're going

06:14.248 --> 06:17.085
to build your father's
champagne-miracle penlight,

06:17.126 --> 06:19.379
crush the summit,
win over Susannah Robb

06:19.420 --> 06:23.383
and stop Barclay's spyware
before the breach hits 100%?

06:23.424 --> 06:26.511
That's a lot, even for you.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.930
If I don't,
the company's money dries up,

06:28.971 --> 06:31.641
I lose Barclay,
and my dad dies in space.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.768
Baby, I'm Tom Swift. Let's go.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.229
(quietly):
Such a drama queen.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.734
TOM: Here's how we get Rowan
to the summit

06:41.776 --> 06:44.070
so I can hack his cell phone.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.488
We'll send Eskol the jet

06:45.530 --> 06:46.906
so he can arrive in style.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.491
Yeah, he would never
turn down a chance

06:48.533 --> 06:50.868
to secure donors
with deep pockets.
Mm.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.286
Well, he'll be able to schmooze

06:52.328 --> 06:53.746
with an audience
whose pockets are so deep,

06:53.788 --> 06:55.289
Adele will be rolling in them.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.499
(Zenzi laughs softly)
And, most importantly,

06:56.541 --> 06:58.292
he'll bring Rowan to us,

06:58.334 --> 07:00.753
since Rowan-- he, um...

07:00.795 --> 07:02.130
Rejected you.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.881
The word is "rejected."

07:03.923 --> 07:05.925
(laughs softly)
This cloning device

07:05.967 --> 07:08.094
will mirror the data
on Rowan's phone.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.680
And with that data, we'll be
able to stop Barclay's spyware.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.432
I created this in college,

07:12.473 --> 07:14.350
just 'cause I wanted
to check on a few jump-offs.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.394
Spy on. You mean spy on?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.354
We used 'em for your boys, too.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.606
(gasps)
(trilling)

07:21.107 --> 07:24.068
The summit rolls out the
company's next big products.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.780
The Augmented Reality Monocle
is our crown jewel.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.450
Wow.
Everyone will get
one of these,

07:30.491 --> 07:32.869
including Rowan.
Dope!

07:32.910 --> 07:36.038
Now, I'll modify the programming
of the monocle to use

07:36.080 --> 07:38.749
facial replacement
software, and no one

07:38.791 --> 07:41.335
will see me while
the festivities are underway.

07:41.377 --> 07:44.547
Rowan tried to ghost me,
but now I'll be invisible.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.382
Poof.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.050
Mm.
LINO:
And that's when

07:48.092 --> 07:49.594
you'll clone Rowan's phone.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.637
Uh, but how close
do you have to be

07:51.679 --> 07:53.973
for the cloning device
to work?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.350
A perfect nine inches
for one minute.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.979
So basically right on top
of the man who's conning you.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.439
Solid plan.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.317
Solid as that lineup.

08:04.358 --> 08:08.446
Mm! Iconic. Timeless.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.406
Lil Nas X has the same pair,

08:10.448 --> 08:13.326
but his are
probably scuffed.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.328
All right, y'all, let's go get
pretty for this summit.

Super clear. Prepping it now.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.513
I'll be out as soon as I'm done.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.167
Hmm.
I'm glad you like it.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.211
Did I say that I liked it...

09:05.253 --> 09:07.755
or that I liked it on you?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.882
A key distinction.
Uh-huh.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.678
Look, I know every major player
in here, so if you want,

09:13.719 --> 09:17.932
I'll be your curly haired
business encyclopedia.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.226
Thank you. I accept.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.645
And, um, my phone's been off,

09:22.687 --> 09:25.147
so, sorry if you've been trying
to get ahold of me.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.358
I haven't.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.531
to the re-rejection...
rejection algorithm.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.826

BARCLAY:
Cloning successful.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.953
It's done.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.705
Meet me in five minutes.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.504
(mechanical chirping)

21:37.546 --> 21:40.173
BARCLAY:
S-Security protocols
are at 42%.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.301
Okay. Okay.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.136
I'm cracking
Rowan's password now.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.680
Uh, two, zero, seven, three.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.308
Once I locate the spyware's
host program, I can...

21:49.349 --> 21:50.892
(buzzing)

21:50.934 --> 21:54.438
Oh, no. What?!
What? You're not his wallpaper?

21:54.479 --> 21:58.317
Oh, no. It's got a secondary
security measure. (sighs)

21:58.358 --> 22:02.321
It needs Rowan's DNA
before we can unlock it.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.364
That's NSA-level security.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.907
For a congressman's bodyguard?

22:05.949 --> 22:07.617
I told you.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.995
Rowan's an enemy
we know nothing about.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.538
We need to regroup

22:11.580 --> 22:13.707
and think,

22:13.749 --> 22:16.168
or a small nick with a tactical
blade could procure some DNA.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.295
Um... no stabbing.
This is a party.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.088
TOM:
Okay? And I am thinking.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.342
We just, uh... We're just
having a minor setback, okay?

22:23.383 --> 22:25.677
We need to get a strand
of hair, some sweat.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.054
Maybe some other bodily fluids

22:27.095 --> 22:28.889
you wouldn't mind
getting from him.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.807
Really? Both of y'all coming
for me on this day? Uh...
Oh!

22:30.849 --> 22:32.017
Crap, crap. We're late to prep

22:32.059 --> 22:33.477
the champagne
for the closing toast.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.687
Okay. Oh, go.
Just. Okay, okay, okay.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.067
BARCLAY:
Security protocols
are at 33%.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.902
33? How much time is that?

22:41.943 --> 22:43.820
Okay, we have
an hour left, maybe two.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.739
Hang tight, Barclay.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.909
We just have to get through the
toast and the closing remarks.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.079
Oh, there you are. Did you
finish Barton's penlight design?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.039
Of course I did.
You know I did.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.835
Oh, the penlight!
You were so busy

22:58.877 --> 23:00.587
earlier, you didn't notice
that you dropped it.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.881
I picked it up
and kept it safe for you.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.050
Oh. Okay.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.471
Okay.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.598
(trilling, whooshing)

23:17.229 --> 23:19.147
(fizzing)

23:21.817 --> 23:24.986
Yeah. I altered Dad's design

23:25.028 --> 23:27.114
so that it could be multiplied
without diluting its power.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.909
To my mentor, Barton.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.619
And to my love.
Hmm.

23:33.620 --> 23:36.123
Mmm.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.582
Oh!
Oh!

23:37.624 --> 23:38.959
It's bad.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.752
Oh.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.505
You have to fix this now.
Oh, oh.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.634
What? What? What happened?

23:47.676 --> 23:51.138
Zenzi, one second.
(sighs)

23:51.179 --> 23:53.223
Someone sabotaged my code.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.225
The pH balance of the champagne
has been multiplied

23:55.267 --> 23:57.227
by a degree
of negative one!

23:57.269 --> 23:59.271
Susannah's asking for you,
and so is everyone else.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.231
Oh.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.691
Please don't tell me that we ran
out of champagne flutes,

24:02.732 --> 24:04.359
and we have
to use drinking glasses instead.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.820
No, it's not that bad.
Tom was only about to

24:06.862 --> 24:08.655
make our investors
vomit the champagne.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.490
JUSTIN:
Right. Um...

24:10.532 --> 24:13.368
ginger ale, baking soda.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.744
TOM:
No. No, no, no.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.664
An antacid wouldn't work, but...

24:17.706 --> 24:20.333
something acidic would.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.960
I can configure the penlight

24:22.002 --> 24:23.879
to use the citric acid
in an orange zest

24:23.920 --> 24:26.214
to fix the pH balance
of the champagne.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.507
Okay?

24:27.549 --> 24:29.176
Multiple it by
a degree of 1.68.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.344
(whooshing, trilling)

24:33.054 --> 24:34.806
(beeps)

24:40.729 --> 24:42.814
(fizzing)

24:52.574 --> 24:53.909
(sighs)

24:53.950 --> 24:55.952
Success.
ZENZI:
Okay.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.871
We make a good team,
Mr. Chase.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.289
Yeah, well.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.374
Let's celebrate later,

25:01.416 --> 25:03.502
just the two of us.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.009
Listen...
Uh-huh, so,

25:11.051 --> 25:12.719
scan all of this zest and then

25:12.761 --> 25:14.554
have the servers garnish
every glass out there

25:14.596 --> 25:16.765
before anyone drinks it.

25:16.806 --> 25:19.518
I'm going to go have a word
with the interloper.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.562
Zenzi, have those done
before I start my speech.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.064
Bye.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.858
Zenzi, you're the greatest.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.443
We also make a fantastic team.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.445
Stop, Tom.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.532
(sighs)

25:33.573 --> 25:35.116
(applause)
Good evening.

25:35.158 --> 25:36.910
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.912
To all of our partners
and investors

25:38.954 --> 25:41.248
and future investors.
(applause)

25:41.289 --> 25:43.208
As you all know,
this is our...

25:43.250 --> 25:46.002
(sighs)
Claire.

25:46.044 --> 25:51.007
I would say you still look sick,
but that's just your face.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.052
Sick with guilt because
you sabotaged my penlight.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.555
Are you insane?

25:56.596 --> 25:58.598
I know what that penlight
means to Lorraine.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.141
Mm, sure.

26:00.183 --> 26:02.852
You see these edges, honey?

26:03.895 --> 26:05.855
They're secured.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.108
So, you're going to have to pull
a lot harder to scalp me.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.610
(applause)

26:10.652 --> 26:12.529
TOM: You see
what the servers are doing?

26:12.571 --> 26:15.574
They're administering
my antidote.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.576
I'm just relieved it all
worked out for the best.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.703
For the sake
of the company.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.455
Oh, is that dandruff?

26:22.497 --> 26:24.958
BARCLAY:
F-Firewalls failing.
Spyware accelerated.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.960
Se-Security protocols
at five percent.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.713
For the sake of the company,

26:29.754 --> 26:32.132
you take it from here.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.009
Tom, what are you doing?

26:34.050 --> 26:36.011
The spyware is accelerating,
and I can't stop it.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.929
I won't lose Barclay.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.889
I know what I have to do,
and I have to do it alone.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.016
Tom, no!

26:41.057 --> 26:42.183
Don't be stupid.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.728
Send voice note.
Rowan, meet me

26:44.769 --> 26:46.980
at Swift Manor observatory,
or I'll confront Eskol

26:47.022 --> 26:49.024
about everything
you've done. Now.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.698
BARCLAY:
P-Protocol's 2.9%.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.366
Why are you surveilling me?

26:58.408 --> 27:00.160
You tell me I deserve to know
what happened to my dad,

27:00.201 --> 27:01.620
and then you ghost me?

27:01.661 --> 27:03.830
It doesn't make sense.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.415
You are one dumb genius.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.667
The Road Back is no joke.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.670
They take out anyone who's in
their way, including their own.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.297
You're going
to get me killed.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.965
How am I in their way? Huh?

27:14.007 --> 27:17.177
What are they after? Tell me.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.263
Do not put your hands on me.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.768
Tell me.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.688
You're a coward.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.732
Admit you feel something
between us.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.109
I'm telling you right now
to leave me alone.

Fine. I will leave you alone.

28:03.640 --> 28:08.812
But only if you tell me
right here, right now,

28:08.853 --> 28:10.814
can I trust you?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.108
No.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.736
Tom!

28:16.778 --> 28:18.530
Thought you said
I couldn't trust you.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.448
BARCLAY: Protocol's 2.4%.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.200
(gasps)

28:22.242 --> 28:23.618
This is your last warning.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.329
I saved your life again.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.708
Don't make me
take it next.

28:30.750 --> 28:33.878
(panting)

28:36.840 --> 28:38.842
What?

28:38.883 --> 28:42.887
You thought my biceps were just
for thirst traps?

28:44.889 --> 28:47.434
You're on the wrong side.

28:47.475 --> 28:52.355
The Road Back hates technology?
All right, bet.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.692
I'm gonna make it so they can't
even brush their teeth

28:55.734 --> 28:57.861
without seeing a Swift
Enterprises pop-up telling them

28:57.902 --> 28:59.487
that their breath stinks.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.531
If you think this is
about a better smartphone,

29:01.573 --> 29:03.074
you're mistaken.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.286
The Road Back wants
to turn back the clock to a time

29:06.327 --> 29:08.788
when people like themselves
were fully in charge.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.332
Pissing them off
with a new gadget

29:11.374 --> 29:13.376
might win a battle,

29:13.418 --> 29:16.504
but you need to focus
on winning the war.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.506
Otherwise,

29:18.548 --> 29:22.135
everyone you love
will end up dead.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.997
...bioadaptive cream

29:51.039 --> 29:53.750
that perfectly matches
your skin tone.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.132
BARCLAY: Tom, 0.5%.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.431
The breach is almost
through my firewall.

30:11.726 --> 30:15.980
Okay. I'm using his DNA
to unlock his phone.

30:16.022 --> 30:20.527
I'm in. Okay, I'm locating
the spyware host now.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.654
BARCLAY: 0.1%.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.951
Zero...

30:29.202 --> 30:31.663
Barclay?

30:31.704 --> 30:34.040
Barclay!

30:34.082 --> 30:35.917
How are you?

30:37.335 --> 30:39.838
BARCLAY:
I am exceptional.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.924
Oh.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.009
(laughs)

30:45.051 --> 30:47.053
Welcome home, buddy. (laughs)

30:47.095 --> 30:49.389
I missed you.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.851
So, we're in the clear?

30:52.892 --> 30:54.227
TOM:
Better than that.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.812
I removed the spyware,

30:55.854 --> 30:57.856
but left the surveillance
software monitoring us.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.524
I created a partition
that will allow us

30:59.566 --> 31:01.484
to feed the enemy
whatever info we want.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.237
So, no matter
who Eskol's working with,

31:04.279 --> 31:05.655
we'll control what they learn.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.823
Reclaiming
the tactical advantage.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.242
I appreciate that,

31:09.284 --> 31:11.703
but let's have a refresher chat
about risk mitigation

31:11.744 --> 31:13.872
moving forward.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.833
Understood.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.293
Good night,

31:18.334 --> 31:20.461
Isaac.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.435
What's wrong?

31:35.476 --> 31:40.064
Today, during fencing tryouts,

31:40.106 --> 31:41.733
I knew what my opponent

31:41.774 --> 31:45.278
was gonna do
before he did it.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.946
It's called good instincts.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.324
That's the stuff
we were practicing, right?
No.

31:49.365 --> 31:52.785
It... It's like
I was hallucinating.

31:52.827 --> 31:55.038
Almost like I could see

31:55.079 --> 31:57.874
electricity moving the nerves
in his muscles.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.878
When did this start happening?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.130
Couple weeks ago.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.799
It's off and on.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.802
I heard Aunt Lorraine
talk about it once.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.971
My mom went through

32:12.013 --> 32:14.933
something like this
when I was three.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.602
Right before
she left me.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.063
She went crazy.
What if that's happening to me?

32:20.104 --> 32:21.648
Listen to me.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.274
You are not her.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.943
Whatever's going on with you,

32:24.984 --> 32:27.362
we'll figure it out,
and we'll deal with it.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.572
I just want to talk to my mom.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.368
Maybe she'd have some answers.

32:40.166 --> 32:43.461
Susannah. Thank you for coming.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.172
Thank you for having me.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.218
Yo! Susannah. How did you like
the closing ceremony?

32:50.259 --> 32:52.136
Well, Claire really wowed
everyone with Swift Enterprises'

32:52.178 --> 32:54.138
plans for the future.
Okay.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.348
Investors were impressed.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.183
Nice. So what are we talking?

32:57.225 --> 32:59.185
Another 100 mil, easy?

32:59.227 --> 33:00.645
Mm.
Mm.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.480
150. (laughs)

33:02.522 --> 33:03.982
Tom... (clears throat)

33:04.023 --> 33:06.401
I want to say
it's not personal, but,

33:06.442 --> 33:08.611
actually, it kind of is.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.572
Swift Enterprises isn't getting
another dime out of me.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.199
You see,

33:13.241 --> 33:15.660
my family's faith
was with Barton.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.495
Mine's supposed to be with you.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.748
Not Claire Cormier. I...

33:20.790 --> 33:23.793
I don't follow her on Instagram.
I follow you.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.795
You are the genius inventor.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.047
You have the Swift last name,

33:28.089 --> 33:29.882
so when you literally
walk away

33:29.924 --> 33:31.759
from an opportunity
to connect to the company,

33:31.801 --> 33:35.263
you show me you can't do
what I did with mine.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.764
Wait a minute.
It's not like that.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.434
I just... I had
to go handle...
Well...

33:39.475 --> 33:42.687
fewer words, more actions, yeah?

33:45.314 --> 33:47.525
Love the shoes, though.
(clicks tongue)

34:01.789 --> 34:04.208
What on earth
were you thinking?

34:05.460 --> 34:06.878
The lack of Susannah's faith

34:06.919 --> 34:08.129
in the company will cause
a domino effect.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.505
I will find a way
to win her back.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.590
Your way was tonight.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.175
Just trust me. I...

34:12.216 --> 34:15.344
How am I supposed to trust you
after all of this?

34:15.386 --> 34:18.347
You know, half of these people
traveled around the world

34:18.389 --> 34:21.976
to have a personal audience
with you.

34:23.269 --> 34:24.937
What was so important

34:24.979 --> 34:27.940
that you could not complete
your obligations, Tom?

34:27.982 --> 34:30.276
All I needed was

34:30.318 --> 34:34.322
15 minutes more of you
acting like an adult.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.659
I thought there would be less
pressure on you now...

34:38.701 --> 34:41.162
Less... pressure?

34:44.248 --> 34:46.167
Without your father here.

34:46.209 --> 34:48.127
(scoffs)

34:48.169 --> 34:50.588
I know he was hard
on you, but...
Oh.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.673
That's a nice way
of putting it.

34:53.716 --> 34:55.760
What are you really
trying to say?

34:55.802 --> 34:58.221
You think I don't know
you're relieved that he's gone?

34:58.262 --> 35:00.056
Relieved?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.058
Relieved?

35:02.100 --> 35:05.061
I'm not relieved.
You don't understand.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.187
Then make...

35:06.229 --> 35:08.564
(indistinct chatter)

35:08.606 --> 35:10.733
Make me understand it.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.860
I'm not relieved,
because he's not...

35:15.113 --> 35:17.532
He's not what?

35:18.157 --> 35:24.163
Otherwise, everyone
you love will end up dead.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.374
Your father is not what?

35:28.751 --> 35:31.546
He's not the reason
I left early.

35:31.587 --> 35:34.882
It's just...

35:34.924 --> 35:37.301
ever since he died,

35:37.343 --> 35:40.555
I haven't felt like myself.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.101
I built his ship.

35:47.019 --> 35:50.064
And then, I watched it explode.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.947
It is the last thing I see
when I close my eyes.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.783
And it is the first thing
I see when I wake up.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.119
(crying, muttering)
Okay. Okay.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.787
Baby, it's okay. It's okay.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.789
I know. I know. I know. I know.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.916
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.382
(crickets chirping)

36:16.424 --> 36:18.551
(fire crackling)

36:32.106 --> 36:34.108
Excuse me. Mrs. Swift?

36:34.150 --> 36:35.902
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

36:35.943 --> 36:39.530
It's Lino.
Is he all right?

36:39.572 --> 36:42.950
He's upset, and he was asking
about his mother.

36:42.992 --> 36:46.120
No, we don't talk
about my sister.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.680
(line ringing)

37:04.722 --> 37:06.307
MAN:
Hello?

37:06.349 --> 37:09.143
Hi. I need you to find someone.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.652
(footsteps approaching)

37:18.653 --> 37:20.196
Time magazine
sent over highlights

37:20.238 --> 37:22.031
for their article
on the summit.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.533
They are calling it
the "Tech Event of the Year."

37:24.575 --> 37:27.119
You should be proud.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.416
Hey.

37:34.293 --> 37:36.379
(sighs)

37:36.420 --> 37:39.548
You know I'm your friend
before an employee.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.259
What's wrong?

37:41.926 --> 37:46.681
Tom just told me his grief
is clouding his judgment.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.600
I'm-I'm losing faith

37:49.642 --> 37:52.561
he can lead the company
in his current state.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.107
We'll find a way forward.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.568
After you get some rest.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.114
Did you like the sleep gel
from the other night?

38:03.155 --> 38:05.241
Oh, yes, I did.
(laughs)

38:05.283 --> 38:08.119
I slept like a baby.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.413
Here. I... I always
have it on me.

38:10.454 --> 38:13.207
It helps me with...
with headaches.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.430
(sighs)
Mmm.

38:27.930 --> 38:33.227
I'm glad you told me
about Tom's... mental distress.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.063
It's so important

38:36.105 --> 38:39.066
that he doesn't struggle alone.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.573
Hold out your finger.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.584
Since Tom is so
emotionally unstable,

38:56.625 --> 39:00.046
the best way we can help him
is by providing supervision.

39:00.921 --> 39:03.132
Sign these,

39:03.174 --> 39:05.801
and I'll have
discretionary approval

39:05.843 --> 39:09.096
over all of his
Swift Enterprises requests.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.891
I promise you,

39:11.932 --> 39:14.185
I'll look after Tom.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.938
I'll make sure
he's safe.
