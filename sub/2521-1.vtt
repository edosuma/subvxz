WEBVTT

00:24.691 --> 00:29.363
Whatever happened, it wasn't me.

00:33.784 --> 00:38.038
Whatever it's done, I'm...

00:41.458 --> 00:44.378
I'm not in control anymore.

01:20.247 --> 01:23.041
It won't let me do it.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.466
I'm hungry.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.094
- Hi, you're Pastor Bobby, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.096
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure to see you.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.307
What a beautiful day.
Beautiful day.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.474
I take credit for it.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.061
Give me the ideal
definition of true love.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.813
That, man.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.898
Yup.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.025
I'm happy for Tim.
Yeah. Who are you?

01:48.150 --> 01:49.359
- I'm his great uncle.
- His great uncle?

01:49.484 --> 01:51.195
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Why are you so great?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.864
Hi, Aunt Molly.
I'm glad you're getting married.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.324
Do you like Tim?

01:55.449 --> 01:57.826
He's okay. He's not the best.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.288
I feel like I did at my prom.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.081
So no hemorrhoid cream
this time?

02:03.207 --> 02:05.667
You swore you would take that
to the grave, you bastard.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.419
- You nervous?
- A little bit.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.170
- It'll be all right.
- You look fine, man.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.589
I just don't know what to do.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.842
You repeat after Bobby,
Pastor Bobby.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.011
You know my dad.
He did this, like, four times.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.721
I mean, how hard can it be?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.389
- Fuck off. We got to go!
- All righty.

02:19.515 --> 02:22.851
Don't you know that it is bad luck
to film the bride before the wedding?

02:22.976 --> 02:23.936
We got to go to the back.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.020
- What?
- That way.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.855
That's not what we did
in the rehearsal.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.148
- What?
- Are you sure?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.441
That's what I was told.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.528
Sweet baby Jesus, look at that.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.071
Okay, ladies, I was actually wrong.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.405
We're supposed to
go around the front.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.573
Supposed to go around the front.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.450
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

02:38.575 --> 02:40.953
Do you understand
how late we are?

02:55.843 --> 02:59.513
And in health will you honor him
and be faithful to him?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.682
I will.

03:08.063 --> 03:11.233
Mr. And Mrs.
Tim and Molly Reynolds.

03:18.657 --> 03:22.160
<i>And here's to my brother</i>
<i>Ben and to Tammy</i>

03:22.286 --> 03:25.747
<i>who I know are looking</i>
<i>down on us right now,</i>

03:25.873 --> 03:30.294
<i>and watching their little girl</i>
<i>start her new life</i>

03:30.419 --> 03:32.713
<i>with her new husband.</i>
<i>Congratulations, guys.</i>

03:32.838 --> 03:34.965
<i>And God love you. Cheers.</i>

03:35.090 --> 03:37.384
Cheers.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.971
<i>I also want to take this</i>
<i>opportunity to apologize to you</i>

03:41.096 --> 03:44.391
<i>for any time that</i>
<i>I may have let you down.</i>

03:44.641 --> 03:47.561
Go! Go! Go...

03:50.564 --> 03:52.733
Three!

04:38.111 --> 04:41.406
Fuck. Fuck.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.662
Where is it coming from?

04:49.331 --> 04:52.292
- Which sensor is it?
- I don't know.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.549
Downstairs in the kitchen.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.269
Hello?

05:10.394 --> 05:12.437
Oh, hi. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.357
It's back door,
downstairs in the kitchen.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.901
Yeah. Don't know.
We don't know.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.362
Yeah, yeah. Just hold on.
Should they call the cops?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.781
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.283
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just go ahead and call them.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.201
We'll be here.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.744
Stay close to me.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.163
- Okay. Yeah. No problem.
- Okay.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.541
Okay.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.878
I'm going to go check it out.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.839
It's probably just a bad sensor
or something. It's fine.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.675
- Well...
- No. I'm just going to go downstairs.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.885
I don't think it's anything.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.053
No. Maybe we should just stay
in the room until the cops come.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.306
Okay, you stay.
You stay, I'll go check it out.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.726
No! Fuck that. I'm going to
come with you if you're going.

05:51.185 --> 05:54.354
Okay. Stay quiet.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.939
Hello?

06:51.662 --> 06:53.956
Hello?

06:58.293 --> 07:00.629
Who's down there?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.592
Who the fuck is down there?

07:11.807 --> 07:14.142
Do not come up here unless you want
to get your fucking head blown off!

07:14.268 --> 07:16.478
I've got a shotgun!

07:18.397 --> 07:21.400
It's okay. It's okay.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.153
We'll just stay here
until the cops come.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.855
- Hi.
- You got an alarm go off?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.399
Yeah. About 15 minutes ago
in the back door.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.776
- Can I come inside?
- Yes, please.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.237
We... we think
we heard footsteps.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.991
- Where's the back door?
- Right through here.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.246
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.085
And you're sure this door was
locked when you went to bed?

08:22.211 --> 08:24.004
Absolutely. I locked it myself.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.215
Because there's no sign
of forced entry here.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.176
I swear to God I locked the door.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.011
Does anyone else
live in this house?

08:31.136 --> 08:33.554
No. - Any reason at all
for anyone you know

08:33.679 --> 08:35.557
to be coming into this house
at this time of night?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.726
No. Nobody.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.770
Okay, I'm going to do
a sweep of the house.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.482
I think it's probably best
if you two wait in one room.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.485
- Where were you when I got here?
- Upstairs, in the bedroom.

08:46.610 --> 08:50.989
Okay. Go on up, lock the door.
I'll come get you when I'm done.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.667
I'm done.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.461
Yeah, we get calls like this
all the time.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.797
A door or window
isn't locked completely,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.966
slowly opens, alarm goes off.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.551
I mean, I guess
that's what happened.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.261
I'm sorry I made you
come all the way out here.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.222
No problem. How long
have you guys been out here?

09:57.347 --> 09:58.891
About three months or so.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.517
It was her parents' place.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.896
Yeah, I was out here
when your father died.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.481
Yeah, we just had the alarm
put in about a month ago.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.318
I'm a truck driver,
so I'm gone a lot.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.820
That's smart.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.573
You two try to get some sleep.
Goodnight.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.866
Thanks, officer.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.993
Thanks for coming out.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.385
I know I locked that fucking door.

12:52.606 --> 12:56.652
Molly, I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm sorry.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.279
What do you want me to do?

13:00.572 --> 13:03.283
It's my birthday tomorrow, Tim.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.454
I just wanted
to spend it with you.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.166
Look, I'll make it up to you
when I get back. Okay?

13:11.291 --> 13:14.628
We'll do...
we'll do a whole thing.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.421
I'll take you out to dinner.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.216
We can have
Hannah and Pete over.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.718
You know?

13:38.944 --> 13:41.029
Hey.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.922
I'm leaving.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.925
Happy birthday.

14:41.715 --> 14:46.595
Hey, Timmy...
Listen, I'm sorry about this morning.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.597
I...

14:48.722 --> 14:52.893
I know you're working hard for us,
and I appreciate it.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.938
I really do. You know,
it's just that sometimes,

14:56.063 --> 14:59.316
I'm all alone in that house. And...

15:00.234 --> 15:01.527
Listen, I love you, baby.

15:01.652 --> 15:02.611
- And...
- Hey, Molly.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.446
Hensley wants to see you
in the break room now.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.698
Okay. Shit, I got to go.
Hensley's on my ass.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.076
I love you.
And I love the earrings.

15:09.201 --> 15:12.162
Please drive safe. Okay.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.256
Happy birthday!

15:24.633 --> 15:27.261
You thought I forgot, didn't you?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.555
Yeah.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.683
Come on, it's my birthday.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.399
It's been a while.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.735
- Well, I hope it has.
- Yeah.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.281
No, wait! Molly, don't.
Give it back.

15:47.406 --> 15:50.409
You shouldn't do it.
Give that back.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.997
I knew I shouldn't have
done this. I shouldn't...

15:55.622 --> 15:58.125
This is terrible.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.506
Fuck, I'm a mother.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.634
I'm not. So hand it back.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.971
You sure, Molls?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.476
Shit. I'm so bad for you.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.021
- No.
- Yeah.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.399
No. Actually you're great for me.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.111
You've always been there.

16:30.490 --> 16:34.786
Oh, babe, I can't believe
you moved back into this house.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.540
We should've sold it
when dad died.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.460
Too bad it ain't worth shit.

16:42.044 --> 16:47.007
And I can't believe we're
smoking weed in mom's kitchen.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.260
Right.

16:52.262 --> 16:56.850
Oh, man. What time is it? Shit.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.353
Oh, shit.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.688
I got to go, Molls.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.900
Fuck...

17:05.025 --> 17:08.069
Hey, Hannah.

17:08.362 --> 17:11.323
Do you remember the week
before she died,

17:11.448 --> 17:14.992
she kept having us bring her
flowers in from outside?

17:22.041 --> 17:25.796
She wanted to get out
of this place so badly.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.883
Happy birthday, babe.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.427
- I love you.
- I love you.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.722
- Kiss Pete for me.
- I will. I will.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.580
Molly...

21:39.049 --> 21:41.635
Look, it's probably just
some neighborhood kids.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.804
This house has been
vacant for so long.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.973
Kids used to hang here
all the time.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.725
They'll stop coming
around after a while.

21:49.518 --> 21:51.353
Right.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.272
I'm going to do a house
to house up here in the morning

21:53.397 --> 21:56.525
to give parents a heads up
on what's happening, okay?

21:56.650 --> 21:59.528
That usually takes care
of things like this.

21:59.653 --> 22:01.947
Okay.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.707
You gonna be all right,
Mrs. Reynolds?

22:16.712 --> 22:19.590
Did you know my father
before he died?

22:21.967 --> 22:23.343
Yeah.

22:23.468 --> 22:27.598
Not personally,
but we came out here a few times.

22:30.601 --> 22:33.103
I don't remember any of that.

22:34.021 --> 22:36.440
Probably a good thing.

22:36.607 --> 22:37.941
I just don't understand
why you wouldn't

22:38.066 --> 22:40.777
come and stay with me and Peter.
He would love it.

22:40.903 --> 22:43.780
Yeah. But you know I can't do that
every single Tim leaves, you know?

22:43.906 --> 22:47.242
You know I'd be over
at your house every single week.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.369
What do you mean every single week?
Just this one time.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.246
Yeah, I know. I just...

22:51.371 --> 22:53.081
I'm not sleeping, that's all.

22:53.207 --> 22:55.167
- Are you pregnant?
- No. I'm not pregnant.

22:55.292 --> 22:56.835
You better tell me if you are.

22:56.960 --> 23:01.965
Do you have anymore...
weed that you think you could spot me?

23:02.883 --> 23:04.927
- I don't have any.
- What?

23:05.052 --> 23:06.345
Frank is out of town.

23:06.470 --> 23:07.554
You don't have any more?

23:07.679 --> 23:08.764
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

23:08.889 --> 23:11.183
You really want to use that
as an excuse to me?

23:11.308 --> 23:13.268
Yeah. Especially to you.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.770
You know how I feel about this.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.605
That's such a bullshit...
That's bullshit excuse.

23:16.730 --> 23:17.981
That's a bullshit excuse.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.608
Molly, what the fuck
do you want me to do?

23:19.733 --> 23:21.193
I don't know.
I want you to forget it.

23:21.318 --> 23:24.196
I want you to just
forget it, you know.

24:29.178 --> 24:32.181
Come on, Molly.
Get your shit together.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.885
Maybe we shouldn't have
moved into this place.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.678
<i>How can you feel</i>
<i>that way, honey?</i>

25:11.803 --> 25:13.514
<i>You're the one</i>
<i>who wanted to move in here.</i>

25:13.639 --> 25:14.973
No, I know.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.892
<i>I mean, you grew up here.</i>
<i>You know?</i>

25:17.017 --> 25:20.062
I was never alone here as a kid.

25:20.187 --> 25:24.233
<i>- Is everything locked up?</i>
- No. Yeah, it's all locked up.

25:24.358 --> 25:28.028
<i>I'll be home tomorrow, sweetie.</i>
<i>All right? I'm sorry, but...</i>

25:28.153 --> 25:29.821
- Yeah.
<i>- You're fine. You're fine.</i>

25:29.947 --> 25:31.406
Okay.

25:31.532 --> 25:33.075
But I just want you
to come home.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.161
<i>- I know. I know.</i>
- I just want you here.

25:36.286 --> 25:39.122
<i>- I'll be there tomorrow, babe. Okay?</i>
- Yeah.

25:39.248 --> 25:41.708
<i>Just get some sleep.</i>
<i>You know I love you.</i>

25:41.834 --> 25:43.919
I love you, too.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.839
<i>Talk to you tomorrow, okay?</i>

29:26.266 --> 29:28.685
Molly, you home?

29:31.104 --> 29:33.482
Molly.

29:35.609 --> 29:38.111
Molly?

29:39.279 --> 29:41.532
Molly?

29:48.497 --> 29:51.291
Molly.

29:52.626 --> 29:55.212
Honey, what are you doing in here?

30:01.802 --> 30:04.555
Baby, what are you...

30:04.680 --> 30:07.140
What are you looking at? You're...

30:07.975 --> 30:10.310
Honey, you're freezing.

30:11.812 --> 30:14.231
Molly.

30:18.193 --> 30:20.863
He's alive.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.667
How you doing?

30:43.427 --> 30:45.846
You feeling all right?

30:47.222 --> 30:49.474
Want to see a doctor?

30:50.726 --> 30:53.187
We don't have health insurance.

30:53.395 --> 30:55.022
I mean, don't worry
about that, babe.

30:55.147 --> 30:58.942
We'll just put it on the card,
figure out how to pay for it later.

31:03.197 --> 31:06.283
What's going on, Molly?

31:09.119 --> 31:11.914
I don't know.

31:12.372 --> 31:14.917
I can't remember.

31:15.918 --> 31:18.253
Are you using again?

31:18.462 --> 31:20.923
- Did Hannah say that?
- I didn't talk to Hannah.

31:21.048 --> 31:23.550
Are you using again?

31:25.552 --> 31:29.223
I smoked a little pot
on my birthday.

31:29.765 --> 31:31.892
That's it.

31:38.232 --> 31:41.235
You know you shouldn't be
doing any of that stuff, babe.

31:41.902 --> 31:45.489
I know. It was just one joint.

31:47.574 --> 31:50.077
You're smarter than that.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.958
When are you leaving again?

31:56.083 --> 31:58.460
Monday.

31:59.044 --> 32:01.421
A short one,
just a couple of days.

32:01.839 --> 32:04.466
I'll be back Wednesday.

32:05.467 --> 32:08.136
I can cancel if you want.

32:08.262 --> 32:10.430
No.

32:11.723 --> 32:13.350
Just go.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.686
We need the money.

32:20.148 --> 32:22.734
Who's alive?

32:23.902 --> 32:26.113
What?

32:26.989 --> 32:30.492
Yesterday when I found you
in the spare room,

32:30.617 --> 32:33.579
you said, "He's alive."

32:34.580 --> 32:37.082
Who's he?

32:53.724 --> 32:57.227
I think this is going to be
good for us, babe.

32:59.271 --> 33:01.982
It's been too long
since we've gone.

33:02.357 --> 33:05.444
Yeah. It has.

33:36.892 --> 33:39.228
Well, suddenly Tim
comes back into town,

33:39.353 --> 33:41.230
and you don't return
my phone calls?

33:41.355 --> 33:43.398
Yeah, I know.
I've just been out of it, you know?

33:43.524 --> 33:44.942
You okay?
You feeling all right?

33:45.067 --> 33:46.568
I mean, Hensley said you
called in sick the other day.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.403
Yeah. I just, you know...

33:48.529 --> 33:51.073
I've got some stuff to figure out.

33:51.198 --> 33:53.909
Well, are you sure?

33:54.034 --> 33:55.202
Yeah.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.621
All right.
Well, look. I got to go.

33:57.746 --> 33:59.581
Yeah, I got to go.
Let's hang out though.

33:59.706 --> 34:01.583
I mean, Ryan's got to get Peter.

34:01.708 --> 34:05.671
And I love you.
And I miss you. And I just want...

34:07.881 --> 34:11.385
It's going to be all right,
Molls, all right?

34:12.177 --> 34:15.013
I know.

36:41.243 --> 36:44.079
Hey, babe, good morning.

36:44.204 --> 36:45.914
I didn't want to wake you. I...

36:46.039 --> 36:49.251
I made some eggs.
I made some bacon.

36:49.376 --> 36:51.420
Babe.

36:51.545 --> 36:53.714
Babe...

37:25.162 --> 37:27.414
Fuck!

37:32.586 --> 37:34.421
Fuck!

37:48.101 --> 37:50.103
Goddamn!

37:50.229 --> 37:52.439
Jesus.

38:00.781 --> 38:03.116
Molly?

38:09.665 --> 38:11.959
Molly!

38:18.298 --> 38:20.008
Molly?

38:20.133 --> 38:21.385
Ron?

38:21.510 --> 38:23.345
You okay?

38:23.470 --> 38:26.348
Yeah, I guess so.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.016
You don't look so good.

38:28.141 --> 38:30.143
Thank you, Ron.

38:30.269 --> 38:32.229
Maybe you should go home.
You might be contagious.

38:32.354 --> 38:33.730
I need the hours, Ron. Come on.

38:33.856 --> 38:36.191
I mean...
I promise I won't cough on anyone.

38:36.316 --> 38:38.569
Look, I'm not supposed to let you
work when you're sick, Molly.

38:38.694 --> 38:40.863
It's not good for the customers
to see you like this.

38:40.988 --> 38:42.197
Come on, Ron.

38:42.322 --> 38:44.116
I'll work back here
if you want me to.

38:44.241 --> 38:46.368
Seriously?

38:46.493 --> 38:48.871
Yeah. Sure.

38:48.996 --> 38:51.540
Just stay out of sight, okay?

39:58.398 --> 40:00.859
Who's there?

40:06.240 --> 40:08.534
Who is it?

40:16.917 --> 40:21.380
<i>Molly, Lovely Molly...</i>

41:01.587 --> 41:04.631
Something is wrong with me.

41:09.303 --> 41:12.181
I'm feeling something.

41:13.015 --> 41:15.309
Someone.

41:20.147 --> 41:24.067
Someone that couldn't
possibly be here anymore.

41:24.651 --> 41:27.905
I... I went through some things,

41:28.947 --> 41:32.242
after my dad died.

41:32.492 --> 41:35.829
And I saw some things...

41:36.371 --> 41:39.124
Some things
that didn't make sense.

41:40.667 --> 41:44.004
And no one...

41:48.675 --> 41:51.136
No one believed me.

41:53.764 --> 41:57.100
I'm going to
show people this time.

41:59.102 --> 42:01.605
Show them all of it.

42:10.280 --> 42:17.538
<i>You did lay in my arms</i>

42:18.247 --> 42:23.335
<i>Molly, lovely Molly</i>

42:23.460 --> 42:29.508
<i>I'll return in the spring</i>

42:30.551 --> 42:33.804
<i>When the angels</i>

42:33.929 --> 42:36.932
<i>And the turtle doves</i>

42:37.057 --> 42:43.438
<i>And the nightingale sing</i>

44:10.817 --> 44:12.694
No. No. No.

44:12.819 --> 44:17.157
Please.
Please. Please. No. No. No.

44:17.282 --> 44:21.870
Please, no.
Why? Why? No. No. No! No!

44:23.705 --> 44:26.875
Not again! No!

44:27.000 --> 44:29.837
Please, no! No!

45:01.076 --> 45:03.161
Molly, hold on a minute.

45:03.287 --> 45:05.038
Don't punch in.

45:05.163 --> 45:08.208
I need to see you in my office.

45:09.710 --> 45:11.962
Close the door.

46:01.553 --> 46:03.805
Please, Ron,
can you just stop it now?

46:03.931 --> 46:05.933
Please.

46:09.353 --> 46:12.606
I'm sorry I had
to show you that, Molly.

46:13.398 --> 46:16.485
I... I never thought
I'd see that kind of thing from you.

46:16.610 --> 46:19.780
I mean, what the hell
were you doing?

46:37.464 --> 46:39.842
Molly?

46:44.847 --> 46:48.642
Well, fuck, Mr. Hensley.
I don't know what to say.

46:49.142 --> 46:52.396
- What?
- I mean, who was that man

46:52.521 --> 46:54.356
that's fucking the shit
out of me in the hallway?

46:54.481 --> 46:56.024
Wait. Wait! What man?

46:56.149 --> 46:57.985
How the hell would I know that,
Mr. Hensley?

46:58.110 --> 46:59.570
Please keep your voice down.

46:59.695 --> 47:01.989
I mean, one minute
I'm lugging trash down the hallway,

47:02.114 --> 47:03.365
and the next minute?

47:03.490 --> 47:06.368
Yeah, pulling down my pants
so this man can nail me from behind.

47:06.493 --> 47:08.871
I mean, it's a goddamn mystery,
Mr. Hensley!

47:08.996 --> 47:10.205
You're completely out of control.

47:10.330 --> 47:11.874
- It's a goddamn mystery!
- You're going home.

47:11.999 --> 47:14.293
- I have no idea!
- Go home!

47:16.420 --> 47:20.424
Okay. I'm coming over.
We're going to talk

47:20.549 --> 47:22.050
and figure all this out.

47:22.176 --> 47:23.427
You don't have to do that.

47:23.552 --> 47:25.137
Oh, I most certainly do.

47:25.262 --> 47:26.555
Don't.

47:26.680 --> 47:29.349
Molly, I'm not asking.

47:30.809 --> 47:33.687
I don't want you to get hurt.

47:33.812 --> 47:36.523
Why would I get hurt?

47:39.193 --> 47:43.447
Molly, why would I get hurt?

47:44.448 --> 47:47.284
Pastor Bobby
is coming over tonight.

47:47.409 --> 47:49.036
Tim wants him to talk to me.

47:49.161 --> 47:53.457
So, I'm in good hands.

48:23.904 --> 48:25.531
You can stay out there
for a few more minutes.

48:25.656 --> 48:27.866
Then you have to come in
and help for dinner, okay?

48:27.991 --> 48:30.410
Okay!

49:51.909 --> 49:54.328
You are a funny man,
Pastor Bobby.

49:54.453 --> 49:55.787
Well, that's my gift.

49:55.913 --> 49:58.248
Actually, not much of a preacher.
I don't think.

49:58.373 --> 49:59.958
Always thought
my future lay in comedy.

50:00.083 --> 50:01.168
What do you think?

50:01.293 --> 50:05.380
I'd stick to preaching
if I were you.

50:05.506 --> 50:06.965
Yeah. I heard that.

50:07.090 --> 50:10.052
No, I didn't come here
to get drunk, Molly.

50:10.177 --> 50:13.263
When was the last time
you got drunk, Pastor Bobby?

50:13.388 --> 50:17.559
I mean, like shit-faced...
Sorry.

50:17.684 --> 50:19.728
I mean, like really drunk.

50:19.853 --> 50:23.190
Well, I don't think
that's appropriate.

50:23.398 --> 50:25.609
Come on, Pastor Bobby.

50:25.734 --> 50:27.903
Even Jesus drank a little wine.

50:28.028 --> 50:30.572
Well, I was fairly tipsy
at your wedding, you'll recall.

50:30.697 --> 50:32.115
Dancing with all the girls.

50:32.241 --> 50:34.618
I remember, Pastor Bobby.

50:34.743 --> 50:36.370
Yes.

50:36.495 --> 50:38.830
But I mean like, stumbling home,

50:38.956 --> 50:42.334
passed out on the lawn
kind of drunk.

50:42.459 --> 50:44.419
Well, it would have been
a very long time ago,

50:44.545 --> 50:47.047
before I was born-again.

50:48.215 --> 50:51.093
You miss it?

50:51.343 --> 50:53.720
Not really. No.

50:53.846 --> 50:56.849
But I thought I was here
to talk about you.

50:59.810 --> 51:02.563
Tim's worried about you, Molly.

51:03.272 --> 51:04.898
I know.

51:05.023 --> 51:07.609
He doesn't want you
to start using again.

51:08.902 --> 51:10.612
I'm not.

51:10.737 --> 51:12.447
And I'm not going to start.

51:12.573 --> 51:14.741
Okay.

51:15.534 --> 51:18.412
So what's up?

51:18.871 --> 51:21.498
- What's up?
- Yeah.

51:23.625 --> 51:27.129
I'm just trying to
deal with something.

51:28.213 --> 51:30.591
What?

51:31.300 --> 51:34.344
Something that I thought
I was done with in my life.

51:34.469 --> 51:36.388
The drugs?

51:36.513 --> 51:39.099
No.

51:41.268 --> 51:43.687
Is it the death
of your parents?

51:47.482 --> 51:50.777
Molly, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:50.903 --> 51:53.447
I know how painful
this is for you.

51:53.572 --> 51:55.490
Grief this strong
can recur at any time.

51:55.616 --> 51:57.034
And it must be
especially difficult

51:57.159 --> 51:59.703
living here in this house
where you grew up together.

51:59.828 --> 52:03.874
- I know how hard this is for you.
- He's not dead.

52:05.834 --> 52:08.086
What?

52:08.295 --> 52:10.464
What did you say?

52:24.144 --> 52:27.022
You like my panties?

52:27.397 --> 52:30.526
Tim got 'em for me for Christmas.

52:30.651 --> 52:31.818
Santa Claus red.

52:31.944 --> 52:35.864
- Molly, I'm so sorry...
- No need to apologize, Pastor Bobby.

52:35.989 --> 52:38.534
You're still a man, aren't you?

52:38.659 --> 52:40.536
I think that I had better be going.

52:40.661 --> 52:43.455
Do you miss fucking, Bobby?

52:46.041 --> 52:47.209
Molly...

52:47.334 --> 52:50.462
I mean, I always wondered
why you weren't married.

52:52.339 --> 52:55.259
You're not gay, are you, Bobby?

52:55.509 --> 52:57.803
No. I'm not.

52:58.428 --> 53:01.223
So do you miss fucking?

53:03.433 --> 53:08.897
Do you miss the feeling
of being inside this?

54:08.582 --> 54:11.168
Molly, what the fuck?

54:13.128 --> 54:17.883
Peter, go to your room! Go. Now.
Shut off the TV and go.

54:25.140 --> 54:27.309
What the hell are you on?

54:27.434 --> 54:28.810
He's here.
I don't know what to do.

54:28.936 --> 54:30.812
I don't know what to do.

54:30.938 --> 54:33.148
Okay. Just calm down.

54:33.273 --> 54:34.650
Okay. Calm down.

54:34.775 --> 54:36.777
Get the fuck off me!
Get off me.

54:36.902 --> 54:39.196
Okay, okay.

54:39.321 --> 54:40.364
He follows me.

54:40.489 --> 54:42.991
He follows me everywhere.

54:43.116 --> 54:45.035
Who, Molly?

54:45.160 --> 54:48.372
You know who. You know!

54:48.497 --> 54:50.874
Okay. Molly, I want to help you.

54:50.999 --> 54:52.376
I am here to help you.

54:52.501 --> 54:56.964
But you have to tell me
what is going on. Please.

54:57.339 --> 55:00.676
Is it the same as last time, Molly?

55:05.138 --> 55:07.808
Molly...

55:16.316 --> 55:18.610
Molly...

55:21.780 --> 55:24.366
I can't do this again, Hannah.

55:26.159 --> 55:28.662
I can't.

55:36.211 --> 55:39.548
Don't put me away again, Hannah.

55:40.132 --> 55:42.676
Please.

56:46.532 --> 56:48.742
Molly!

56:50.577 --> 56:53.121
Molly!

57:05.217 --> 57:07.427
Fuck...

57:07.553 --> 57:09.179
I checked all the vents,

57:09.304 --> 57:13.517
the cellar, the attic,
all the rooms.

57:14.101 --> 57:16.311
It's just horrible.

57:16.436 --> 57:19.106
It was like something died
in the house.

57:19.231 --> 57:22.150
I haven't smelled anything.

57:27.281 --> 57:29.950
How you been feeling?

57:31.285 --> 57:33.745
Okay.

57:37.499 --> 57:40.127
You sleeping much?

57:42.045 --> 57:45.591
No. Not at all.

57:50.137 --> 57:53.515
I really think you should see
Dr. Dean, Molly.

57:53.974 --> 57:57.603
Maybe he can give you
something to help you sleep.

58:01.982 --> 58:05.235
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow, okay?

58:07.863 --> 58:11.658
He says everyone
will abandon me again.

58:44.900 --> 58:46.568
Molly?

58:46.693 --> 58:49.821
I loved you so much.

58:55.202 --> 58:58.539
We both loved you so much.

59:01.625 --> 59:04.461
You're lying.
Hannah could never do that.

59:04.586 --> 59:07.005
Never.

59:11.885 --> 59:14.805
I don't believe you.

59:15.889 --> 59:19.977
You would never have done
those things if you cared for me.

59:22.145 --> 59:25.899
I know what you are, really.

59:27.484 --> 59:29.361
No.

59:29.486 --> 59:32.239
I'm not scared.

59:33.407 --> 59:35.951
Not anymore.

59:38.745 --> 59:40.873
What?

59:41.874 --> 59:44.418
Tim?

59:45.085 --> 59:47.337
Tim?

59:55.846 --> 59:58.599
Baby, what...

01:00:04.313 --> 01:00:06.857
Baby, the fucking smell...

01:00:06.982 --> 01:00:09.484
You two never met.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.154
This is Tim, my husband.

01:00:12.279 --> 01:00:16.617
Tim, this is my father, Ben.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.666
You don't see him?

01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:25.876
It's okay.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:27.169
You don't see him?

01:00:27.294 --> 01:00:31.381
It's okay. Come on.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:35.511
I knew you wouldn't
show yourself to him.

01:00:36.011 --> 01:00:38.847
You're nothing
but a fucking coward!

01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:41.016
Yeah, show yourself.

01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:42.559
Show yourself to him.

01:00:42.684 --> 01:00:44.686
Come to bed.

01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:47.481
Just fucking once!
Do something.

01:00:47.606 --> 01:00:48.815
You fucking animal.

01:00:48.941 --> 01:00:50.526
Show yourself to someone
other than me!

01:00:50.651 --> 01:00:51.610
Come on!

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.070
I'm not crazy, Tim.
I'm not crazy.

01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.238
You have to believe me.

01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:55.614
I know, baby. I know.

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.533
No one believed me before.
You have to believe me.

01:00:57.658 --> 01:00:59.034
I do. I do.

01:00:59.159 --> 01:01:01.537
He's fucking with me.
Leave me alone!

01:01:01.662 --> 01:01:04.331
Quit fucking with me!

01:01:07.835 --> 01:01:10.712
You need to stop, Tim.

01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:16.718
What?

01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:22.140
That's what he said.

01:01:22.933 --> 01:01:25.519
That you need to stop.

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:38.031
<i>She's fine, physically, Tim.</i>

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:41.785
<i>I mean, she's exhausted.</i>
<i>But otherwise she seems healthy.</i>

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:43.912
<i>We're taking some blood</i>
<i>to run the usual tests,</i>

01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:47.124
<i>but I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>they'll come back just fine.</i>

01:01:47.249 --> 01:01:50.752
<i>I'll write you a prescription,</i>
<i>something to help her sleep.</i>

01:01:50.878 --> 01:01:53.547
<i>Just make sure</i>
<i>she takes them tonight.</i>

01:01:54.506 --> 01:01:57.134
And what if the pills
don't work?

01:01:57.259 --> 01:02:00.095
These will put her down, Tim.
I can guarantee you that.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.472
No. But I mean,
what if she keeps going on

01:02:02.598 --> 01:02:05.267
with all this stuff about
her father and all that?

01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:09.229
Well, at that point, I'd recommend
a psychiatric consultation.

01:02:12.232 --> 01:02:15.402
What if she becomes dangerous?

01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:29.291
Molly?

01:02:31.752 --> 01:02:34.046
Molly?

01:02:37.174 --> 01:02:39.927
You want your pills now?

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:54.102
Molly! Fuck...

01:04:54.686 --> 01:04:56.605
He's here! He's here. He's here.

01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:58.273
Calm down. It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:00.192
- Baby.
- He's here.

01:05:00.317 --> 01:05:01.401
He's here.

01:05:01.527 --> 01:05:03.946
Molly, there's nobody here.
Just calm down okay?

01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:06.031
- Get off me.
- Baby, it's all right.

01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:09.451
He's coming up the steps.

01:05:09.576 --> 01:05:11.286
Baby, just calm down okay?

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:13.997
He's right outside.
Can't you hear him?

01:05:14.122 --> 01:05:15.499
Molly, I can't hear anything.

01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:18.627
Can't you hear him?
He's right outside!

01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:22.631
- There's nobody out here, baby.
- He's right there!

01:05:22.756 --> 01:05:25.551
He's right there
at the fucking door!

01:05:25.676 --> 01:05:28.428
Molly!

01:05:33.517 --> 01:05:35.394
Molly...

01:05:35.519 --> 01:05:38.313
Come on out, baby. It's okay.

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:43.110
Molly, come on out, babe.

01:05:45.946 --> 01:05:49.908
Molly, I'm coming in.
Don't fucking freak out, all right?

01:05:55.622 --> 01:05:57.916
Baby...

01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:01.253
What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:02.462 --> 01:06:05.007
Baby...

01:06:05.924 --> 01:06:09.011
Come on, put the camera away,
all right?

01:06:09.344 --> 01:06:11.638
Molly.

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:15.309
Molly!

01:06:15.809 --> 01:06:18.103
Molly.

01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:20.272
Molly!

01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:28.280
Baby...

01:06:31.283 --> 01:06:32.659
Baby...

01:06:32.784 --> 01:06:33.952
I'm sorry.

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:36.872
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:39.166
Come here.
Come here. I'm so sorry.

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.126
I'm so sorry.

01:06:41.293 --> 01:06:44.213
What's happening?

01:06:44.338 --> 01:06:46.465
- We're going to get through this.
- What's going on?

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.050
I love you so much.

01:06:48.175 --> 01:06:51.845
I'm sorry. All right?

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.058
It's okay.

01:07:55.576 --> 01:07:57.119
Tim?

01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:59.705
Yeah!

01:08:08.338 --> 01:08:10.674
She did this to you?

01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.593
Yeah.

01:08:12.718 --> 01:08:16.846
Let me see.
Tim, let me see your mouth.

01:08:18.432 --> 01:08:20.475
Jesus Christ,
you've got to go to the hospital.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.935
You're going to need stitches.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.395
I'm fine, Hannah!

01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:29.609
Where is she?

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:32.613
Ran off into the fucking woods.
I don't know where.

01:08:32.738 --> 01:08:36.033
Well, we need to
fucking find her, Tim!

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:42.038
You want to know what I found
just lying out on the fucking table?

01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:46.502
Just lying there, Hannah, like she
doesn't give a fuck about anything!

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:50.005
It's just her way of
asking for help, Tim.

01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:53.341
Yeah, no, I know
how to help her.

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:56.303
- I'm calling the fucking police.
- No.

01:08:57.845 --> 01:09:00.307
My uncle tried that before
and she just got worse.

01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:01.975
Please, just let me talk to her.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.603
She's dangerous, Hannah.

01:09:04.728 --> 01:09:08.273
You have no idea the kind of shit
she does around here.

01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:12.819
You don't know what they did to her
in that hospital before, Tim.

01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:14.529
You didn't have to
live through that before!

01:09:14.654 --> 01:09:17.241
She needs psychiatric help, Hannah!

01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:19.076
She needs psychiatric help!

01:09:19.201 --> 01:09:21.828
No!

01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:26.917
Tim, just let me talk to her.

01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:29.752
Please.

01:09:38.095 --> 01:09:40.096
Fuck.

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:45.185
This is crazy.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.272
Please, Tim, I'll take her.

01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:54.528
I'll take her if you're afraid.

01:09:56.446 --> 01:09:59.324
I love her, Hannah.

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:02.244
I just don't know
how to help her.

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:04.705
I know.

01:10:06.456 --> 01:10:08.750
I'll find her, just...

01:10:08.876 --> 01:10:12.546
You go to the hospital
and get that looked at, okay?

01:10:22.139 --> 01:10:24.808
Molly!

01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:27.144
Fuck.

01:10:27.269 --> 01:10:29.396
Molly, we're not going to hurt you.

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:31.690
Molly!

01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.904
Molly?

01:10:42.242 --> 01:10:44.494
Molly?

01:10:46.246 --> 01:10:47.789
Molly?

01:10:47.915 --> 01:10:49.791
Molls.

01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:53.504
Molly! Molls! God!

01:10:53.712 --> 01:10:57.216
Wait! Molly!

01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:12.481
Oh, God...

01:11:25.702 --> 01:11:27.955
Molly?

01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:34.503
Molly, you down there?

01:11:37.631 --> 01:11:39.925
Molly?

01:11:47.057 --> 01:11:49.476
Molly?

01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:17.004
Molly!

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:21.800
Oh, God.
Oh, Molly, what'd you do?

01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:24.344
He told me.

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:27.139
What?

01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:29.766
He told me.

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:33.770
He showed me what you did.

01:12:47.868 --> 01:12:49.745
You did it.

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:52.206
You did it.

01:12:52.664 --> 01:12:54.917
You did it!

01:13:02.466 --> 01:13:04.885
You killed him!

01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:12.434
You killed Daddy!

01:13:59.147 --> 01:14:03.277
I tried to protect you
after Mom died.

01:14:05.112 --> 01:14:08.532
But I couldn't be here
all the time.

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:19.126
He promised me he'd stop.
But he didn't.

01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:28.385
Why'd you have to move back
into this goddamn house, Molly?

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:35.601
You remember being here
with me in this room?

01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:39.605
Yeah.

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:43.609
You'd hide in the closet.

01:14:45.194 --> 01:14:48.822
We always felt safe
in this room, didn't we?

01:14:56.413 --> 01:15:01.418
Molly, I want you to come and
stay with us for a little while,

01:15:01.543 --> 01:15:03.420
with me and Peter.

01:15:03.545 --> 01:15:06.882
Okay? We got to get you
out of this house.

01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:10.219
I can't go, Hannah.

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:14.598
Molly, you have to.

01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:17.601
I can't leave you here alone.

01:15:17.726 --> 01:15:19.394
Please.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.938
We can get through this again.

01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:25.234
Just... You just have to
get out of this house.

01:15:25.359 --> 01:15:27.861
He'll hurt him.

01:15:29.071 --> 01:15:31.240
He'll hurt Peter.

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:34.201
What?

01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:40.374
Gut him from belly to throat,
like a fucking fish.

01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:05.417
Go. Go now. Please.

01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:14.635
Then tell me, just tell me!

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.596
Tell me!

01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:23.227
<i>The spring</i>

01:17:23.644 --> 01:17:26.688
<i>When the angels</i>

01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:29.900
<i>And the turtle doves</i>

01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:35.864
<i>And the nightingale sings</i>

01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:52.352
<i>Hannah, when you hear this,</i>

01:20:52.477 --> 01:20:55.272
<i>it'll all be over.</i>

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:58.609
<i>It'll all be done.</i>

01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:03.238
<i>They'll find things here.</i>

01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:04.781
<i>Horrible things.</i>

01:21:04.907 --> 01:21:08.243
<i>But I want to tell you,</i>

01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:11.872
<i>I don't remember doing any of it.</i>

01:21:12.372 --> 01:21:15.542
<i>It wasn't me, Hannah.</i>

01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:18.378
<i>It's never been me.</i>

01:21:19.546 --> 01:21:21.548
<i>It's him.</i>

01:21:22.549 --> 01:21:25.552
<i>It's all been him.</i>

01:21:28.972 --> 01:21:31.808
<i>I love you, Hannah.</i>

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:35.437
<i>I love you so much...</i>

01:21:36.396 --> 01:21:39.233
<i>My sister.</i>

01:21:44.988 --> 01:21:48.242
<i>You were right</i>
<i>to kill him, Hannah.</i>

01:23:04.193 --> 01:23:06.862
Hey, officer, I live just up
the road. What's going on?

01:23:06.987 --> 01:23:09.198
Person was reported missing today.
Please keep moving.

01:23:09.323 --> 01:23:10.532
Who?
Who was reported missing?

01:23:10.657 --> 01:23:13.994
I don't know.
Please keep moving, sir?

01:23:20.626 --> 01:23:22.961
Fuck.

01:24:13.762 --> 01:24:16.014
Molly?

01:24:26.191 --> 01:24:28.527
Molly, you home?

01:26:56.592 --> 01:26:59.052
I'm sorry, Molly.

01:27:01.513 --> 01:27:04.266
I'm sorry.

01:27:07.644 --> 01:27:10.606
I know you are, sweetie.

01:27:30.584 --> 01:27:32.419
No...

01:29:02.009 --> 01:29:05.804
No! No!

01:29:05.929 --> 01:29:10.392
No, baby! No! No!

01:29:10.517 --> 01:29:15.314
My baby! No! No!

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:20.944
Please, let me just hold my baby!

01:29:21.862 --> 01:29:24.531
Please! Just let me see her!

01:29:25.000 --> 01:34:00.001
