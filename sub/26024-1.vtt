01:23.415 --> 01:24.750
Fuck!

01:24.850 --> 01:27.484
<i>Jacob, I want to see
those lights off.</i>

01:27.486 --> 01:28.688
In a minute.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.072
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:48.240 --> 01:49.741
I'll turn it off
in a minute.

02:11.597 --> 02:12.831
Night, mom.

02:12.865 --> 02:14.767
<i>Close your door, Jacob.</i>

02:47.532 --> 02:48.800
Fuck.

03:03.215 --> 03:05.615
Jacob!

03:05.617 --> 03:09.386
Jacob, stop it! Stop it!
I have had enough.

03:09.388 --> 03:12.555
You go to sleep,
or I will kill you, you hear me?

03:12.557 --> 03:14.791
- I will kill you!
- That's enough! That's enough! Hey.

03:14.793 --> 03:16.595
He won't go to sleep.

03:16.695 --> 03:19.196
- I can't stand it. I can't stand... do you hear me?
- Shh! Enough. Enough.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.930
- Go back to your room.
- Not one more night of this!

03:20.932 --> 03:22.733
I'll take care of it.
Go back to your room.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.300
Not one more night!

03:24.302 --> 03:26.838
Oh, Jacob, it's all right.
Everything's fine.

03:27.239 --> 03:29.840
It's just... Oh, Jesus.

03:34.513 --> 03:35.946
Your mother's
a passionate woman.

03:35.948 --> 03:37.583
That's why I fell in love
with her.

03:38.251 --> 03:39.751
That's why I'm still in love
with her.

03:40.885 --> 03:43.855
But when you scream
and shout every night, it...

03:45.290 --> 03:46.691
it makes her tense.

03:48.828 --> 03:52.231
I know I'm not your real father,
and I could never replace him...

03:52.931 --> 03:54.699
but I want to be your friend.

03:56.468 --> 03:58.271
An apology would go
a long way.

04:09.314 --> 04:10.315
I'm sorry.

04:31.637 --> 04:34.639
It's all right,
sweetheart. It's gonna be fine.

04:40.545 --> 04:42.646
Your grandmother
passed last night.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.714
The world is better off.

04:44.716 --> 04:46.951
- Shh. Isabel.
- It's true.

04:47.019 --> 04:48.987
She was a horrible woman.

04:49.021 --> 04:52.725
You never met her, so you
can't begin to understand.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.861
That's why I never let her
see you...

04:56.963 --> 04:58.864
even when you were born.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.102
<i>We need to bury her.</i>

05:19.483 --> 05:21.187
- What did she look like?
- Shh.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.053
- Amen.
- Amen.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.235
Hey!

05:36.334 --> 05:39.004
You have her eyes. Feiga's eyes.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.971
And also her face here,
and the chin and the cheeks.

05:41.973 --> 05:45.343
- You're hurting my arm.
- What, a little old woman like me can hurt your arm.

05:45.377 --> 05:48.414
You're a softy. Not like Feiga.
Feiga wasn't soft.

05:48.447 --> 05:49.682
None of us were.

05:50.716 --> 05:53.417
Not if you wanted to live.

05:53.584 --> 05:56.221
You think that's bad?
You should see the rest of me.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.824
A boy gave them to me,
a soldier.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.123
He found out where
we were hiding, all of us,

06:01.125 --> 06:04.493
and he told me if I didn't do
what he wanted,

06:04.495 --> 06:06.464
he would tell them
how to find me.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.699
So I did what he wanted.

06:08.867 --> 06:10.668
And every time he finished,

06:10.670 --> 06:13.635
he gave me another mark
with his knife.

06:13.637 --> 06:15.074
I don't know why.

06:15.673 --> 06:17.707
My father, my brothers,

06:17.709 --> 06:20.078
they knew what was happening,
and they did nothing.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.882
Your grandmother was in a hiding
place with us, but she was alone.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.885
We didn't know her,
her family, nothing.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.688
She didn't like me.
She never said one word to me.

06:31.690 --> 06:35.091
And I don't blame her.
I was a vain little girl.

06:35.093 --> 06:38.364
Brought a makeup kit from home,
all kinds of little tchotchkes.

06:38.463 --> 06:41.932
One day, I noticed my nail file
was missing.

06:41.934 --> 06:45.404
Well, I didn't give it much
thought until one night,

06:45.870 --> 06:47.805
when everyone was asleep,

06:47.906 --> 06:49.973
I woke up and heard a sound.

06:51.776 --> 06:55.946
She was sitting in the corner
with her hands by her mouth.

06:56.014 --> 07:01.151
She was sharpening her teeth
with my nail file, like this.

07:03.956 --> 07:06.188
Jacob!

07:06.190 --> 07:09.726
Are you crazy? How dare you
frighten him like that?

07:09.728 --> 07:11.162
How dare you?

07:21.807 --> 07:23.542
What are we gonna do
with all her stuff?

07:25.144 --> 07:27.946
We are going to sell
the best pieces...

07:28.480 --> 07:29.881
and give the rest away.

07:32.517 --> 07:34.786
How come we don't have any
pictures of grandma anywhere?

07:39.225 --> 07:41.393
How come that old lady said
I have eyes like her?

07:42.026 --> 07:43.261
Oh, Jacob...

07:43.762 --> 07:45.161
she was crazy.

07:45.163 --> 07:47.465
- Isabel?
- Just like my mother.

07:48.033 --> 07:50.700
- Sweetheart, the matinee's starting soon.
- Oh.

07:50.702 --> 07:53.872
- We're going to be late.
- Oh, I want you to have your book finished

07:53.906 --> 07:55.805
by the time we come back
to pick you up.

07:55.807 --> 07:57.509
We are going
to a very important dinner

07:57.776 --> 07:59.977
at Davis's
senior partner's house. Hmm?

08:00.178 --> 08:04.349
And... no television.
Understand?

08:17.730 --> 08:20.032
<i>No! No!</i>

08:46.591 --> 08:48.626
I know. It's surprising.

09:01.940 --> 09:05.144
Shit.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.278
Hey, guys.
What's happening?

09:29.167 --> 09:31.068
We're so happy
to have you all here.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.570
- Thank you so much for making the trip.
- Isabel, you're even lovelier

09:33.572 --> 09:35.305
- than Davis described.
- Oh!

09:35.307 --> 09:37.175
No wonder you have
been hiding her.

09:37.208 --> 09:40.710
- Well, it's so nice to finally meet you.
- Ma'am, I can take your coat.

09:40.712 --> 09:43.213
Oh, I'm... I'm actually...

09:43.215 --> 09:45.248
We've been married less than
a year. Didn't Davis mention...

09:45.250 --> 09:49.252
- Of course Davis told me. I'm sorry.
- Oh, please don't be.

09:49.254 --> 09:50.887
It looks like we're
both new around here.

09:50.889 --> 09:53.323
Ah! And this must be Christine.
So pretty.

09:53.325 --> 09:56.195
It was more of a whirlwind
than you and Isabel.

09:57.062 --> 09:58.597
Two weeks after we met,

09:58.798 --> 10:01.064
- we were on our honeymoon in Paris.
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.066 --> 10:04.235
I have a new wife,
and the children have a mother.

10:04.269 --> 10:05.901
Well, stepmother.

10:05.903 --> 10:07.539
Like in fairy tales.

10:08.639 --> 10:10.475
Sometimes life's like
a fairy tale.

10:10.942 --> 10:13.511
In fairy tales, stepmothers
are wicked.

10:15.047 --> 10:18.183
Well, there are all kinds of
monsters in stories, aren't there?

10:18.716 --> 10:21.818
I love Paris. My father
was French, you know.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.400
How about you, Jake?
Do you speak French?

10:38.202 --> 10:40.170
Oh, that is really good.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.674
How did you learn
to speak so well?

10:42.706 --> 10:45.477
I was "tooted."

10:45.943 --> 10:47.146
"Tooted"?

10:47.745 --> 10:49.978
Yeah. I had a "toota."

10:55.953 --> 10:57.555
He grew up in Brooklyn.

10:58.823 --> 11:01.358
Why don't you kids
go play a little while

11:01.360 --> 11:04.194
and let us grown-ups talk about
boring grown-up things a little.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.131
I like grown-up things.

11:06.331 --> 11:09.468
Well, then by all means, Rupert,
you're welcome to stay.

11:16.408 --> 11:17.608
Shut up.

11:20.111 --> 11:21.346
What are you reading?

11:22.847 --> 11:24.182
<i>Captain America.</i>

11:25.984 --> 11:27.285
Do you like it?

11:28.687 --> 11:29.688
It's an old one.

11:31.056 --> 11:32.458
It was my brother's.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.728
Not Rupert.
My other brother, Timothy.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.697
He's dead.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.467
It was a tragedy.

11:43.735 --> 11:45.136
My grandmother just died.

11:45.770 --> 11:47.038
So what?

11:49.073 --> 11:51.075
Old people are supposed to die.

11:51.976 --> 11:53.478
Timothy was 12.

11:54.812 --> 11:56.582
My mother was 36.

11:57.282 --> 11:58.550
Your mother?

11:59.149 --> 12:00.419
My real one.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.853
Thirty-six isn't 12,
but according to my dad,

12:03.855 --> 12:05.790
it still qualifies as a tragedy.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.627
Plus she killed herself, so she
doesn't get to go to heaven.

12:11.863 --> 12:14.433
- My father died.
- How old was he?

12:16.134 --> 12:17.368
I don't know.

12:18.836 --> 12:21.272
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

12:22.307 --> 12:24.543
Well, almost 13.

12:24.942 --> 12:27.078
That's called 12.

12:29.179 --> 12:30.381
How old are you?

12:31.048 --> 12:32.483
Almost 13.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.391
You're pretty.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.797
- I... I'm a boy.
- Boys can be pretty.

12:45.764 --> 12:46.798
Boys are handsome.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.568
- Maybe you're not a boy.
- I'm a boy.

12:50.335 --> 12:52.737
- If you say so.
- I'm a boy!

12:53.337 --> 12:54.540
Prove it.

12:55.908 --> 12:59.711
Jacob, darling, you ready to hit the road?

13:00.445 --> 13:02.881
- Ooh!
- Are you gonna cry, you fuckin' pussy?

13:03.481 --> 13:06.350
Oh, is this what you want? Hey,
look what I found in her bag.

13:06.918 --> 13:08.753
Give it.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.093
What is wrong with you, Jacob?
Why do you waste your time

13:17.095 --> 13:20.598
watching television and reading
comics when it gives you nightmares?

13:21.265 --> 13:24.133
- Comics don't give me nightmares.
- Oh, well, television does.

13:24.135 --> 13:26.637
And then you don't sleep,
and then you fight in school.

13:27.272 --> 13:30.172
- I wasn't fighting.
- Well, whatever it is that you did,

13:30.174 --> 13:32.142
it got you suspended for a week.

13:32.943 --> 13:35.911
<i>You are gonna be
home alone every day this week</i>

13:35.913 --> 13:37.215
<i>while I'm at work.</i>

13:38.082 --> 13:39.817
<i>No comics.</i>

13:41.119 --> 13:42.788
<i>If you give me any more grief...</i>

13:44.023 --> 13:45.790
<i>I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.</i>

18:48.492 --> 18:49.727
Jacob.

18:59.403 --> 19:02.740
I didn't say anything about,
well, you know what,

19:02.906 --> 19:04.141
to your mother.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.578
That can stay between us.

19:13.217 --> 19:15.953
Jacob, this is Dr. Sherman.

19:18.222 --> 19:19.624
Have a seat, Jacob.

19:20.191 --> 19:21.193
Go.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.902
Brooklyn boy, huh?

19:33.337 --> 19:34.772
You've been making trouble.

19:36.807 --> 19:38.275
You can talk?

19:40.411 --> 19:42.280
Of course he can talk. Jacob...

19:43.247 --> 19:45.083
For now, listening will be fine.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.718
People who can listen
are much rarer

19:48.720 --> 19:51.021
than those who can talk.
Isn't that right, Jacob?

19:56.560 --> 19:58.996
I want to tell you a little
about our school, Jacob.

19:59.931 --> 20:02.133
I thought... I thought you were
a doctor.

20:02.366 --> 20:03.634
I am.

20:04.001 --> 20:06.936
I am also the principal of the
boarding school you'll be attending

20:06.938 --> 20:09.140
next semester
after the holidays.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.977
I know. It's a bit
of a surprise.

20:13.979 --> 20:17.214
But your parents
and I had to determine

20:17.315 --> 20:20.751
if you were the right fit
for us and vicey-versey.

20:21.819 --> 20:23.588
I think you'll fit just fine.

20:25.623 --> 20:28.790
I run an exclusive school
especially designed

20:28.792 --> 20:31.262
for unique young people
like yourself.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.930
We can only accommodate
a few students,

20:33.932 --> 20:36.899
so it's a far cry
from the sturm und drang

20:36.901 --> 20:38.870
you're used to in the big city.

20:43.674 --> 20:46.542
<i>At first
it may take a little adjustmen,</i>

20:46.544 --> 20:50.348
<i>but you will find that peace
and quiet refresh the mind</i>

20:50.381 --> 20:52.017
<i>as well as the spirit.</i>

20:53.518 --> 20:55.153
<i>Like it says
in the Good Book...</i>

20:55.753 --> 20:59.690
<i>"Only in the wilderness,
is man-made pure again."</i>

21:07.598 --> 21:08.831
Good morning, sir,
may I help you?

21:08.833 --> 21:11.001
- Yes. Uh, Davis Rathbone.
- Claude.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.701
- Jacob?
- Yeah, Jacob.

21:12.703 --> 21:14.371
Please proceed right up
the hill, sir.

21:15.038 --> 21:16.308
Thank you.

21:48.373 --> 21:49.406
Hi.

21:49.941 --> 21:52.309
- Hello. Mrs. Sherman.
- Mrs. Sherman.

21:52.344 --> 21:53.678
This is Jacob.

21:55.346 --> 21:56.647
Davis.

22:10.627 --> 22:13.098
You be good, hmm?

22:26.076 --> 22:28.279
- <i>Thank you, Mrs. Sherman.</i>
- <i>Of course.</i>

22:32.517 --> 22:33.882
Are you hungry, Jacob?

22:33.884 --> 22:35.854
We stopped at
a Howard Johnson's.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.191
Well, it's getting late.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.927
There's a closet here,
and a bureau.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.763
Organize your things
and get into bed.

22:47.365 --> 22:48.433
What one?

22:49.400 --> 22:50.702
You mean "which" one.

22:51.669 --> 22:53.071
Whichever one you prefer.

22:53.938 --> 22:55.306
How come there's two?

22:55.772 --> 22:58.208
You mean,
how come there "are" two?

23:00.144 --> 23:03.246
There'll be two of you in this room.
You'll have a roommate.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.316
His arrival has been delayed.

23:05.950 --> 23:07.251
Uh, Miss Sherman?

23:09.153 --> 23:10.387
Are you our teacher?

23:11.423 --> 23:15.059
- Dr. Sherman is your teacher.
- Thought he was the principal.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.962
He is. He's also your teacher.

23:18.730 --> 23:19.963
There's only one teacher?

23:20.498 --> 23:22.500
It's a small school.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.203
How many kids are there?

23:25.470 --> 23:28.239
You'll meet your fellow students
at breakfast in the morning.

23:30.008 --> 23:31.509
Any more questions?

23:33.111 --> 23:34.512
Can I sleep with the light on?

24:23.461 --> 24:24.561
Whoa, whoa.

24:29.666 --> 24:31.201
I see you've met our son.

24:35.573 --> 24:36.674
Uh, Phil?

24:37.273 --> 24:39.543
Your parents told me what happened
to you, about the fire and all.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.578
Sorry I screamed.

24:42.613 --> 24:44.446
It's okay. I should've knocked.

24:44.448 --> 24:46.951
- I didn't want to wake you up.
- No, it's okay.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.386
You want to put your stuff away
and everything?

24:49.921 --> 24:52.156
No, I'll do it in the morning.

24:54.692 --> 24:55.894
Okay.

25:07.771 --> 25:09.139
Good morning, Jacob.

25:11.741 --> 25:13.177
How did you sleep?

25:13.844 --> 25:15.046
Fine.

25:17.214 --> 25:19.583
Orange juice and milk
are on the table.

25:23.253 --> 25:24.454
Yes?

25:25.623 --> 25:26.925
Can I have some bacon?

25:28.859 --> 25:30.861
I thought your people
didn't eat bacon.

25:31.895 --> 25:33.097
I eat bacon.

25:33.263 --> 25:36.367
I mean, at home. I eat it when
my mom makes it.

25:38.035 --> 25:39.871
Tomorrow I'll prepare you some.

26:15.071 --> 26:16.440
Hey, what's up?

26:17.342 --> 26:19.344
Fuck you. Eat shit.

26:21.278 --> 26:23.414
Look, if I bothered you,
I can just leave.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.283
Piss and shit!
Piss and shit! Fuck!

26:27.285 --> 26:28.586
Turd burglar!

26:29.820 --> 26:32.022
Ah! Fuck you!
Fuck you!

26:33.625 --> 26:34.992
What's... what's up?

26:35.259 --> 26:36.461
What?

26:36.894 --> 26:39.664
Piss and shit! Turd burglar!
Shit on a shingle!

26:46.003 --> 26:47.237
Hey.

27:12.396 --> 27:14.197
Everybody quiet!

27:14.765 --> 27:16.234
Quiet down!

27:17.035 --> 27:19.069
Do you hear Mrs. Sherman?

27:20.171 --> 27:21.506
Be quiet!

27:22.772 --> 27:23.974
All of you.

27:24.907 --> 27:26.143
Right this minute.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.212
This is Phil...

27:28.878 --> 27:30.180
your classmate.

27:31.015 --> 27:32.684
Can I please go eat upstairs?

27:33.182 --> 27:34.585
Take a seat, Phil.

27:36.753 --> 27:37.955
Come on, now.

27:38.690 --> 27:41.693
You'll all sit together
and eat in...

27:42.794 --> 27:44.059
relative silence.

27:44.061 --> 27:45.429
What's for breakfast?

27:46.664 --> 27:48.165
You're late, young lady.

27:48.464 --> 27:50.033
I overslept.

27:50.367 --> 27:53.003
Where are my parents?

28:02.880 --> 28:04.549
Who are these freaks?

28:15.359 --> 28:17.092
Good to see you've found
your places

28:17.094 --> 28:18.695
without any assistance from me.

28:19.396 --> 28:21.531
You will meet me here
every morning,

28:21.833 --> 28:24.168
- Ten minutes after breakfast.
- Eat shit!

28:24.468 --> 28:25.702
Excuse me?

28:26.036 --> 28:28.539
Shit on a shingle! Shingle shit!

28:33.810 --> 28:35.746
Are you quite finished, Frederic?

28:42.019 --> 28:45.822
You will find three books
in the drawers in your desks.

28:46.123 --> 28:47.790
A math textbook,

28:48.125 --> 28:51.762
an English textbook,
and the Holy Bible.

28:52.730 --> 28:54.197
When you come in...

28:54.965 --> 28:59.934
you will see on this board
the name of the book and chapter

28:59.936 --> 29:01.671
we'll be starting with
that morning.

29:02.039 --> 29:04.139
You will open your book
to that chapter

29:04.141 --> 29:07.242
and read in silence
until I indicate

29:07.244 --> 29:10.946
it's time to discuss your reading
and give out assignments.

29:10.948 --> 29:12.517
That will take us to lunch.

29:13.217 --> 29:15.586
After lunch, you're free

29:15.853 --> 29:18.786
to play outside for an hour
under the supervision

29:18.788 --> 29:21.157
of either myself
or Mrs. Sherman.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.926
You are not to attempt
to leave these grounds

29:23.928 --> 29:27.095
for any reason, under any
circumstances whatsoever.

29:27.097 --> 29:29.833
You are to be washed
and ready for bed

29:29.901 --> 29:31.536
at 7:30 sharp.

29:32.869 --> 29:34.103
Any questions?

29:34.270 --> 29:37.174
My father told me this was
a bed and breakfast.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.743
That sounded suspiciously
like a statement,

29:40.010 --> 29:42.277
rather than a question,
Miss Holcomb.

29:42.279 --> 29:44.011
I want to see my father.

29:44.013 --> 29:46.117
And that sounded like a demand,

29:46.250 --> 29:48.549
one which you are in no position
to be making,

29:48.551 --> 29:51.286
as your parents clearly
do not share your sentiment,

29:51.288 --> 29:53.857
else you would not be here
this very moment.

29:56.827 --> 29:58.596
Why would my father lie to me?

29:58.796 --> 30:00.131
Finally, a question...

30:00.431 --> 30:04.234
unfortunately, one that
we both know the answer to,

30:04.268 --> 30:06.436
so there's no point
in discussing it here.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.203
I'm not going to school
in this place.

30:09.205 --> 30:11.475
Oh, yes, Miss Holcomb,
I'm afraid you are.

30:32.262 --> 30:35.631
I have left your bottom
unscathed, Miss Holcomb,

30:35.898 --> 30:40.504
simply because I want it comfortably
planted back in your seat.

30:41.238 --> 30:42.807
Have I made myself clear?

30:46.542 --> 30:49.613
Clarity... is what I strive for,

30:50.315 --> 30:54.484
and what we will all strive for
in the upcoming two weeks.

30:56.186 --> 30:59.389
Elwood... Come, Elwood.

31:00.057 --> 31:01.325
It's all right.

31:05.496 --> 31:07.298
Have I made myself clear?

31:07.565 --> 31:10.099
Fart-sicle!

31:10.101 --> 31:12.403
Fuck-sicle!

31:17.508 --> 31:18.709
Good.

31:20.176 --> 31:21.511
Open your bibles.

31:29.987 --> 31:32.256
Hey, take it easy, man.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.458
Just catch it.

31:37.394 --> 31:39.628
How do you get up there?
I won't even try it.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.328
Elwood,
what are you doing?

31:41.330 --> 31:42.899
He's gonna bust us out.

31:46.636 --> 31:47.905
Wow, you throw hard.

31:48.605 --> 31:51.876
I'll trade your glove
for my catcher's mitt.

31:52.442 --> 31:53.909
Man, my hand is killing me.

31:54.044 --> 31:57.014
Suck your hand. Suck it.
Suck it!

31:57.681 --> 31:59.717
Whoa, why do you have to curse
so much, Frederic?

32:01.152 --> 32:05.690
I... I don't...

32:09.160 --> 32:12.029
Because he's a freak,
that's why.

32:12.462 --> 32:15.832
Are you done having
a spaz attack, spaz?

32:15.932 --> 32:17.367
We're just playing catch.

32:18.999 --> 32:19.269
I can see that.

32:19.635 --> 32:23.705
Unlike the rest of you freaks,
I'm neither a spaz or a retard.

32:23.707 --> 32:26.542
- I'm not a retard or a spaz.
- Then why are you here?

32:26.544 --> 32:29.510
- Why are you here?
- 'Cause my parents fuckin' lied to me, that's why.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.881
Fuckin' lied!
Fuckin' fucker! Mother...

32:32.583 --> 32:34.282
Try not to curse around him
so much.

32:34.284 --> 32:35.786
Did your parents?

32:36.653 --> 32:40.424
- Did my parents what?
- Lie to you when they brought you here.

32:40.590 --> 32:42.659
They told me I was coming here
for the new semester.

32:43.961 --> 32:45.395
What about you, spaz?

32:45.429 --> 32:50.568
My mother said whatever's inside
of me needs to be driven out...

32:51.268 --> 32:52.603
so I can walk...

32:54.337 --> 32:58.408
righteousness with Jesus Christ,
our Lord and s...

33:01.045 --> 33:02.413
savior.

33:03.547 --> 33:04.781
Two weeks.

33:06.182 --> 33:08.952
Dr. Sherman said he was
going to strive for clarity

33:09.086 --> 33:10.620
in the next two weeks.

33:10.721 --> 33:11.922
So?

33:12.089 --> 33:15.425
Two weeks is a lot shorter
than a semester.

33:15.625 --> 33:16.827
Isn't it?

33:17.060 --> 33:18.396
All right, kids.

33:18.761 --> 33:20.397
Playtime's over.

33:21.531 --> 33:22.732
Come on.

33:25.001 --> 33:28.673
Guess you are here
'cause you're a retard.

33:32.608 --> 33:33.843
Frederic...

33:57.535 --> 33:58.969
Jesus Christ.

34:09.346 --> 34:10.746
Are those supposed to be stars?

34:11.414 --> 34:13.382
Yeah, stars and planets.

34:15.119 --> 34:16.853
They don't look like stars
and planets.

34:17.788 --> 34:19.022
Turn off the light.

34:35.405 --> 34:37.107
I have them on my wall at home.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.842
I look at them every night
before I go to bed.

34:40.476 --> 34:42.911
I pick a planet, and I picture
what it's like.

34:43.847 --> 34:45.280
What do you mean,
what it's like?

34:45.282 --> 34:48.851
Well, is it hot or cold,
gaseous or solid?

34:48.853 --> 34:51.853
Are there canyons
or rock formations?

34:51.855 --> 34:53.588
How many moons does it have?

34:53.590 --> 34:55.658
What are the primary chemicals
of its makeup?

34:56.860 --> 34:58.528
You know, stuff like that.

34:59.429 --> 35:00.730
What about aliens?

35:01.264 --> 35:03.599
Uh, it's almost impossible
to find a planet

35:03.601 --> 35:05.135
that can support any kind
of life.

35:05.568 --> 35:09.472
The culmination of factors that need to
exist simultaneously are astronomical.

35:11.474 --> 35:12.709
Did you ever find any?

35:12.842 --> 35:16.412
Yeah, once, but it was
just rudimentary life...

35:16.414 --> 35:19.347
you know, amoebas,
some silicone life-forms.

35:19.349 --> 35:20.818
Nothing you would recognize.

35:23.219 --> 35:24.220
You know what's weird?

35:24.621 --> 35:25.823
What?

35:26.657 --> 35:28.025
My dad died in a fire.

35:28.824 --> 35:30.093
He used to smoke.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.193
And one time when he was alone
in his office,

35:33.195 --> 35:35.064
he took a nap with a cigarette
in his hand,

35:35.498 --> 35:37.801
and it fell, and the whole place
burned up, and he died.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.205
What's weird about that?

35:43.340 --> 35:44.575
Just that...

35:44.909 --> 35:46.977
you know, it's kind of like...

35:47.411 --> 35:50.548
what happened, you know, to you.

35:51.581 --> 35:52.849
Well, I mean,

35:53.250 --> 35:55.851
there are finite ways for people
to die or get hurt.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.818
I mean, minus
insignificant variations,

35:57.820 --> 36:01.524
you can get shot,
or burned, or...

36:02.358 --> 36:06.696
get sick, or fall,
or get hit by a car, whatever.

36:07.630 --> 36:10.798
Let's say, give or take,
it's a few dozen ways.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.934
Or for argument's sake,
let's say it's a hundred

36:12.936 --> 36:15.039
or even a thousand,
which it isn't.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.240
How many people are there
on the planet?

36:17.840 --> 36:20.943
- I don't know. A billion?
- Six billion.

36:21.244 --> 36:23.644
You take six billion,
and you divide it by a thousand.

36:23.646 --> 36:25.479
If you went around,
and you asked everyone

36:25.481 --> 36:27.416
how they got hurt
or how someone they knew died,

36:27.418 --> 36:29.853
you'd find more commonality
than you would variation.

36:30.621 --> 36:34.524
So... I don't really see
what's weird about that.

36:44.701 --> 36:45.903
Phil?

36:46.670 --> 36:48.071
My dad's dead, but...

36:48.905 --> 36:50.574
he didn't burn up in a fire.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.078
So... why did you say
that he did?

36:56.746 --> 36:58.848
Just thought it might
make you feel better.

37:01.251 --> 37:02.852
Now, that's weird.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.057
Phil?

37:08.257 --> 37:10.760
If you're the one imagining what
your planets are like anyways...

37:11.594 --> 37:14.030
why don't you just imagine life
on them whenever you want to?

37:15.798 --> 37:17.568
No, that would be cheating.

37:19.536 --> 37:21.604
- Phil?
- Yeah?

37:23.239 --> 37:24.274
Good night.

38:05.349 --> 38:07.017
Phil!

39:48.050 --> 39:49.318
Jacob?

39:51.989 --> 39:53.688
Jacob.

39:53.690 --> 39:56.059
- It's just me. Don't be scared.
- Phil, I swear to God.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.928
Sorry, it's just...
it's time for breakfast.

39:59.161 --> 40:00.363
Sorry.

40:10.873 --> 40:13.276
"Let no one despise your youth.

40:14.510 --> 40:16.979
But be an example to believers

40:16.981 --> 40:22.386
in word, in deed, in spirit,
in faith,

40:22.751 --> 40:24.088
in purity."

40:24.822 --> 40:26.990
It was with these words,

40:27.157 --> 40:29.326
that Paul instructed Timothy,

40:29.726 --> 40:33.229
to strive for perfection
in all areas of life.

40:33.797 --> 40:36.867
I want you to copy those words
into your notebooks.

40:38.635 --> 40:39.870
Yes?

40:41.905 --> 40:44.140
How come he doesn't have to do
any work?

40:44.840 --> 40:48.443
I would think, Miss Holcomb, being
the bright young lady you are,

40:48.445 --> 40:50.981
the answer to your question
would be easily apparent.

40:51.514 --> 40:53.916
Then what's he doing
in the same class as me?

40:54.518 --> 40:56.919
What was it that
Paul instructed Timothy,

40:56.954 --> 40:58.188
Miss Holcomb?

40:59.056 --> 41:03.691
To be an example in word,
deed, faith and purity.

41:03.693 --> 41:05.028
And do you know...

41:05.596 --> 41:09.798
how those words
bind each one of you

41:09.932 --> 41:11.267
sitting here together?

41:13.503 --> 41:14.838
They are goals...

41:15.771 --> 41:18.841
each one of you,
in his own way...

41:19.242 --> 41:21.011
has failed to achieve.

41:21.911 --> 41:23.178
For is not,

41:23.612 --> 41:26.949
in his own way,
each one of you...

41:27.884 --> 41:29.153
despised?

41:30.887 --> 41:33.089
Despised by your peers,

41:34.490 --> 41:36.193
despised by your parents,

41:37.659 --> 41:39.162
despised by God?

41:40.164 --> 41:41.932
Our parents love us.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.569
Did you raise your hand, Lenny?

41:47.704 --> 41:49.906
We are not concerned
here with...

41:50.541 --> 41:53.844
how you appear to your friends
or even to your parents.

41:54.510 --> 41:56.379
We are concerned here,

41:56.646 --> 42:00.046
with becoming presentable
to the only eyes that matter,

42:00.048 --> 42:03.252
and the only way to do that
is to be baptized anew.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.921
There are many kinds
of baptism:

42:06.923 --> 42:08.926
baptism by water...

42:09.592 --> 42:11.328
baptism by fire...

42:11.927 --> 42:13.829
baptism by the Holy Spirit.

42:14.197 --> 42:16.133
The ways are not important.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.169
It's the final result
that counts.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.572
Any questions?

42:23.840 --> 42:26.076
Yes, Miss Holcomb?

42:26.210 --> 42:27.877
Can I go number one?

42:29.813 --> 42:31.548
If you are not back in...

42:32.650 --> 42:36.886
three and a half minutes,
Miss Holcomb...

42:37.653 --> 42:39.189
it will go ill for you.

43:11.653 --> 43:13.522
It turned into a number two.

43:30.706 --> 43:33.409
This school sucks.

43:34.710 --> 43:37.012
You should really lock the door.

43:38.248 --> 43:41.450
- What are you doing here?
- Shh! I didn't go to the bathroom.

43:41.784 --> 43:44.521
I went into Dr. Sherman's
office instead.

43:44.887 --> 43:47.189
I found Mrs. Sherman's
pocketbook in there.

43:48.157 --> 43:49.358
She had this.

43:50.760 --> 43:52.629
And this.

43:53.329 --> 43:54.964
I don't want them.

43:54.998 --> 43:57.466
Look at the names, retard.

43:58.869 --> 44:00.103
See?

44:00.369 --> 44:02.269
So her name's not really
Miss Sherman?

44:02.271 --> 44:03.539
Apparently not.

44:04.407 --> 44:06.042
So what does that mean?

44:06.809 --> 44:09.278
It means she's lying
about her name.

44:09.746 --> 44:11.714
- And what about Dr. Sherman? Is he...
- Sorry.

44:12.181 --> 44:15.651
This is all I managed to get
in three and a half minutes.

44:17.019 --> 44:18.220
Well...

44:18.922 --> 44:21.357
almost three and a half minutes.

44:25.061 --> 44:26.296
Does it hurt?

44:27.996 --> 44:29.231
Yeah.

44:30.132 --> 44:32.001
But I kind of like the way
it feels.

44:32.969 --> 44:34.136
Look.

44:34.369 --> 44:35.571
They match.

44:36.139 --> 44:37.406
Cool, right?

44:39.041 --> 44:40.343
Want to touch it?

44:42.311 --> 44:43.546
That's okay.

44:44.213 --> 44:45.749
You know, I guess
you were right.

44:47.050 --> 44:50.153
- About what?
- That boys can't be pretty.

44:52.054 --> 44:53.356
'Cause you're a girl.

44:54.291 --> 44:56.724
- I'm not a girl.
- You're pretty.

44:56.726 --> 44:58.325
I'm not a fucking girl!

44:58.327 --> 45:02.030
If you weren't, you wouldn't be
too scared to touch my face.

45:02.065 --> 45:03.998
I'm not scared.
I just don't want to.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.400
Because you're a girl, and
you only like to touch boys.

45:06.402 --> 45:08.338
- No, 'cause it'll hurt.
- So?

45:08.871 --> 45:10.740
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Why not?

45:13.175 --> 45:14.477
Because it's bad?

45:17.380 --> 45:19.383
Yeah. I guess.

45:20.717 --> 45:22.352
Even if I want you to...

45:26.489 --> 45:27.691
touch it?

45:38.434 --> 45:40.267
Here, take it.

45:40.269 --> 45:42.338
Get rid of it!
Get rid of it!

45:46.376 --> 45:48.545
What are the two of you
doing in here together?

45:49.146 --> 45:50.744
The water spigots were stuck,

45:50.746 --> 45:53.282
so I asked Jacob to help me
turn them on.

45:55.085 --> 45:56.319
They're working now.

45:58.788 --> 46:02.825
Dr. Sherman taught you a lesson
from Timothy today, did he not?

46:06.161 --> 46:07.563
I hope you were listening.

46:07.864 --> 46:10.999
My ball! Don't touch my ball!

46:11.001 --> 46:12.202
My ball!

46:13.335 --> 46:14.836
Fuck off! Fuck off!

46:15.237 --> 46:17.171
He just wants to play ball
with us, Frederic.

46:17.173 --> 46:19.106
My ball!
Get the fuck away!

46:19.108 --> 46:21.409
Get the fuck away!
My ball! Don't touch my ball!

46:21.411 --> 46:23.647
Don't touch my fucking ball!
Fuck you, fatty!

46:24.181 --> 46:27.417
Shit. Easy, Elwood.
Take it easy.

46:27.516 --> 46:29.785
Guys. Guys!

46:31.353 --> 46:34.256
Get off me! No!
Get away!

46:35.023 --> 46:36.425
Get away! Get...

46:36.893 --> 46:38.894
That's enough!

46:50.539 --> 46:51.807
Come on, Elwood.

46:53.576 --> 46:56.646
- Let's go back inside. Come on.
- Okay.

47:13.061 --> 47:15.264
That was weird,
in the yard today.

47:15.599 --> 47:17.934
Elwood's a retard.
That's just what they do.

47:18.001 --> 47:19.436
I'd hardly call it weird.

47:20.336 --> 47:22.772
No, not Elwood. You.

47:23.472 --> 47:26.609
- What was weird about me?
- The way you walked.

47:28.478 --> 47:31.881
- The way I walked?
- Yeah, when you were bringing Elwood inside.

47:32.815 --> 47:33.883
What was weird about it?

47:35.083 --> 47:36.385
You walked weird.

47:37.887 --> 47:38.889
Weird like how?

47:39.422 --> 47:40.622
Weird, like...

47:41.324 --> 47:43.859
- like a girl.
- I don't walk like a girl.

47:44.061 --> 47:47.196
Why is everybody saying I'm a girl?
I'm not a fucking girl!

47:53.603 --> 47:55.370
Are you going to bed?

47:56.072 --> 47:58.642
No, I'm going to fucking Pluto.
Where do you think I'm going?

47:59.509 --> 48:01.310
Well, you didn't shower.

48:01.376 --> 48:02.711
What's it to you?

48:03.413 --> 48:04.848
You kind of need one.

48:05.315 --> 48:07.548
So I smell bad. You look bad,
and I smell bad.

48:07.550 --> 48:09.218
So that makes us even, right?

48:30.940 --> 48:33.410
Wh... what do you think that was?

48:45.320 --> 48:47.790
Should... should we get
Mrs. Sherman?

48:48.958 --> 48:50.359
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:51.327 --> 48:52.629
Come on, let's look.

49:01.003 --> 49:02.439
You coming?

49:02.672 --> 49:05.908
- I'm scared.
- Phil, take it from me.

49:06.675 --> 49:09.945
Whatever it is, it can't be half
as scary as you are.

49:26.563 --> 49:27.763
Come on, Phil.

49:39.708 --> 49:42.611
Hey! Do you guys hear that?

49:42.711 --> 49:44.814
Yeah, we hear it.
We're not here for our health.

49:44.981 --> 49:47.650
- What's going on?
- I don't know, Lenny.

49:47.684 --> 49:49.719
I'm Calvin.

49:52.422 --> 49:54.591
It's coming from Frederic and Elwood's room.

49:59.094 --> 50:00.629
Frederic?

50:02.331 --> 50:03.532
Frederic?

50:05.467 --> 50:07.536
Maybe we should get
Mrs. Sherman.

50:24.686 --> 50:26.423
Elwood, what are you doing?

50:28.157 --> 50:29.358
Elwood.

50:32.628 --> 50:35.530
Jeez, it smells awful in here!
Oh, man!

50:35.532 --> 50:36.732
Elwood?

50:46.510 --> 50:48.744
- I made.
- Yeah, I can see that.

50:49.045 --> 50:51.915
- Why didn't you use the bathroom, Elwood?
- Oh, man, that's gross!

50:52.248 --> 50:53.450
Where's Frederic?

50:55.117 --> 50:56.086
He went away.

50:56.452 --> 50:58.586
Yeah, I would too. Jeez.

50:59.088 --> 51:00.890
Come on, Elwood.
Let's go take a shower.

51:01.757 --> 51:03.825
Guys, help me get him to the shower.

51:03.827 --> 51:05.726
- Hell, no!
- He's gross, man.

51:05.728 --> 51:09.162
- No way.
- No, my doctor said I can't afford to get an infection.

51:09.164 --> 51:11.600
Whatever, man. Just get a breath
of fresh air or something, okay?

51:13.168 --> 51:15.469
Elwood, if you don't
come with me,

51:15.471 --> 51:18.840
then I'm gonna have to call Dr. Sherman,
and he's gonna come up here with his rod.

51:18.842 --> 51:20.877
- Do you want that?
- Uh-uh.

51:21.110 --> 51:22.111
Good.

51:22.478 --> 51:24.613
Come on. Let's clean you up.

51:25.414 --> 51:27.917
Oh, that's disgusting!

51:32.320 --> 51:33.522
Stop.

51:50.673 --> 51:51.874
Come on, man.

51:53.175 --> 51:54.176
Let's go.

52:03.519 --> 52:05.220
Frederic went away.

52:05.387 --> 52:08.590
F... farty fuck-sicle!

52:08.858 --> 52:10.059
Far away!

52:18.166 --> 52:19.602
Thank you, Claude.

52:21.704 --> 52:22.906
Here you go.

52:27.777 --> 52:32.080
Claude and Mrs. Sherman are taking
Frederic to the hospital in town,

52:32.315 --> 52:34.817
where he will be picked up
by his parents.

52:35.318 --> 52:37.851
We'll discuss this further
in class tomorrow.

52:37.853 --> 52:41.123
But for now, I want you
to go back to your rooms,

52:41.157 --> 52:42.225
get ready for bed.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.559
Can we call our parents?

52:45.561 --> 52:48.897
Of course, Calvin. You can
call your mom tomorrow,

52:49.231 --> 52:51.600
during playtime,
from my office.

52:52.168 --> 52:55.636
You too, Jacob. You can all
call your parents tomorrow.

52:55.871 --> 52:57.839
- But for now...
- It's not that, Dr. Sherman.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.210
Just that Elwood, he's still...
you know.

53:06.514 --> 53:07.983
I'll take care of it.

53:08.717 --> 53:10.285
You've done enough for one day.

53:12.320 --> 53:14.089
Come along up to bed, children.

53:15.425 --> 53:16.693
It'll be all right.

53:17.693 --> 53:19.796
Everything's going to be
all right.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.274
Come on, Elwood. Let's go.

53:33.342 --> 53:36.646
It's safe now. You'll be fine.

53:53.262 --> 53:54.896
Christine, what are you doing
in here?

53:55.498 --> 53:57.563
Christine, if Dr. Sherman
catches you in here,

53:57.565 --> 53:59.133
we could get in serious trouble.

53:59.835 --> 54:02.769
Then we'd better not stay here.
This is our chance.

54:02.771 --> 54:05.505
That guard guy and whatever-her-name-is
are going to town.

54:05.507 --> 54:08.610
Dr. Sherman is cleaning up
Elwood in the bathroom.

54:09.278 --> 54:11.378
We've got to get out of here.
Now.

54:11.380 --> 54:13.280
Seriously, Christine,
where are we gonna go?

54:13.282 --> 54:15.818
- We don't even know where this frickin' school is.
- "School"?

54:15.851 --> 54:18.220
Jacob, we have three textbooks
in our desks,

54:18.288 --> 54:21.856
and the only one Dr. Sherman has
ever asked us to open is the Bible.

54:21.858 --> 54:24.560
Have you ever heard of a school
like that?

54:24.827 --> 54:27.062
Or one that only has
seven kids in it?

54:27.664 --> 54:28.865
Six.

54:29.965 --> 54:32.301
It... it was seven. Now it's six.

54:32.902 --> 54:34.136
Two weeks.

54:34.804 --> 54:37.604
Dr. Sherman said we were
going to strive for clarity

54:37.606 --> 54:39.208
in the next two weeks.

54:39.775 --> 54:41.644
That's eight days from now.

54:41.878 --> 54:43.846
What do you think's gonna
happen then?

54:46.349 --> 54:48.084
Don't look at me.
I'm not getting in trouble.

54:51.320 --> 54:54.223
- Seriously, guys, I'm not getting in trouble.
- What are you doing?

54:54.423 --> 54:56.923
We don't have time to pack.
We've got to go now, retard.

54:56.925 --> 54:58.160
Hold your horses.

54:59.362 --> 55:00.363
Let's go.

55:15.610 --> 55:17.211
We'll cut through here.

55:17.213 --> 55:19.816
Then we'll get to the front
entrance, same way we came in.

55:20.016 --> 55:22.048
Maybe it might be better
to climb over the fence.

55:22.050 --> 55:25.385
I've been checking it whenever
whatever-her-name-is isn't looking.

55:25.387 --> 55:27.554
There's electric wire
everywhere.

55:27.556 --> 55:30.091
- Electric wire?
- Yeah, like for cows.

55:30.826 --> 55:33.961
- Cows?
- Cows, city boy. You eat them.

55:34.030 --> 55:36.396
Anyway,
they're taking Frederic to town,

55:36.398 --> 55:38.100
so we can walk
right out of here.

55:45.675 --> 55:47.243
That's the car
they took him in.

55:48.376 --> 55:49.845
But there's nobody in it.

55:51.646 --> 55:55.117
- So what does that mean?
- It means they never left.

56:08.764 --> 56:10.232
Come on! Let's go,
let's go!

56:20.141 --> 56:21.810
We better go back to school.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.747
I guess.

56:25.815 --> 56:27.316
We're gonna get
in so much trouble.

56:28.050 --> 56:29.252
"We"?

56:31.686 --> 56:34.588
I was wondering when you two were
going to make your reappearance.

56:34.590 --> 56:37.657
I don't want to stay here.
Frederic died in here.

56:37.659 --> 56:39.928
I... I just want to go home!

56:40.862 --> 56:42.296
I'm sorry, Dr. Sherman.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.298
She got really scared
and tried to run away,

56:44.300 --> 56:46.766
so I went to bring her back so she
wouldn't get in more trouble.

56:46.768 --> 56:49.805
Yes, Jacob. I believe you did.

56:50.706 --> 56:52.175
Go back to your room.

56:54.677 --> 56:55.911
Just you, Jacob.

56:56.445 --> 56:59.015
- But, Dr. Sherman, she was just...
- Jacob, go back to your room...

56:59.914 --> 57:02.151
and do not come out again
until morning.

57:06.621 --> 57:07.856
Jacob...

57:09.992 --> 57:13.863
come see me tomorrow
in my office before class.

58:19.494 --> 58:20.495
Have a seat.

58:22.898 --> 58:24.567
You're a clever boy, Jacob.

58:25.733 --> 58:28.570
But then,
your people usually are.

58:29.938 --> 58:31.139
My people?

58:34.043 --> 58:37.013
You know... don't you?

58:38.713 --> 58:39.948
Know what?

58:39.981 --> 58:42.050
That Frederic
didn't kill himself.

58:48.625 --> 58:50.590
Didn't you break up
a fight yesterday

58:50.592 --> 58:53.092
between Frederic and Elwood
during recess

58:53.094 --> 58:56.028
and get a bloody nose
for your trouble?

58:56.030 --> 58:57.399
I didn't get a bloody nose.

58:59.534 --> 59:02.504
Elwood is certainly
strong enough to have done it.

59:03.005 --> 59:05.408
Elwood couldn't kill anyone.
Not like that.

59:05.740 --> 59:06.943
Of course not.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.118
Jacob...

59:17.186 --> 59:21.257
do you know why
Christine Holcomb is here?

59:24.159 --> 59:25.994
She killed her older brother.

59:28.764 --> 59:32.134
- How come?
- Because, Jacob, she is evil.

59:35.670 --> 59:37.173
She killed her own brother...

59:37.806 --> 59:39.675
and her mother too.

59:41.710 --> 59:44.379
- She said her mother killed herself.
- Indeed.

59:44.780 --> 59:47.616
In sorrow,
over the death of her son.

59:48.083 --> 59:50.818
I would imagine that
in young Miss Holcomb's mind,

59:50.820 --> 59:54.089
that would qualify as two birds
with one stone.

59:55.023 --> 59:56.492
How come she isn't in jail?

59:56.891 --> 01:00:00.396
That would be rather embarrassing for Mr.
Holcomb, don't you think?

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.172
I'm telling you this, Jacob...

01:00:10.838 --> 01:00:13.575
because Mrs. Sherman and I
are shorthanded here.

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:16.479
I need your help...

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.649
keeping an eye
on the other kids...

01:00:20.715 --> 01:00:22.617
making sure they stay
out of trouble.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.422
Can you do that for me?

01:00:29.324 --> 01:00:30.526
Come on, Elwood.

01:00:31.092 --> 01:00:33.295
We'll get done a lot faster if
you just eat the regular way.

01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.133
Bite down on it.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:42.604
No, Elwood, Elwood.
Back on the fork.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:46.676
Almost. Almost. There you go.

01:00:47.275 --> 01:00:48.644
See how much better that is?

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.019
Come on, Phil.
It's a foot off the ground.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:59.555
- I don't have all day.
- Okay. Here.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.122
Take this one...

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:04.626
and put it up to the left,
right there.

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:07.562
See, that's... that's Andromeda.
Put it to the left of Andromeda.

01:01:08.063 --> 01:01:10.930
Jacob... Jacob,
put it to the left.

01:01:10.932 --> 01:01:12.767
The big clump of stars
right there. No...

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:14.703
Not your left, my left.

01:01:15.103 --> 01:01:17.672
I'll give you <i>X</i> week one
for a Frank Miller cover.

01:01:17.806 --> 01:01:19.175
Is there a variant?

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:21.542
It's a Frank Miller cover.
Who cares what the variant is.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.612
Plus I'll give you
this <i>Machine</i> too.

01:01:24.246 --> 01:01:26.714
I'll give you Jimmy Key
and Wade Boggs.

01:01:26.981 --> 01:01:30.416
Thanks. You guys are cool.
How come you're here?

01:01:30.418 --> 01:01:32.153
Our parents brought us.

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:34.656
But why?

01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:37.526
Did you do something bad
at like, school or at home?

01:01:37.893 --> 01:01:39.194
We were always good.

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.396
Okay, but there
has to be a reason.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.337
Were you guys adopted?

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:50.539
No.

01:01:51.106 --> 01:01:52.607
These are both
your real parents?

01:01:58.246 --> 01:01:59.514
Where do you want this one?

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:02.350
- Over here.
- Right here?

01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:04.618
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:07.289
How about that?
Are you sleeping with that?

01:02:17.432 --> 01:02:18.633
Good night, Elwood.

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.603
If you have to go to the
bathroom, just knock, okay?

01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:25.641
- Jacob?
- Yeah?

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:28.611
Thank you.

01:02:30.177 --> 01:02:31.379
Sure thing.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.122
Hey.

01:02:44.092 --> 01:02:45.528
Can you come here a minute?

01:02:49.197 --> 01:02:52.767
- I've got to get to bed.
- I have something of yours.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.140
Remember?

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:06.848
- Where's my knapsack?
- Right over there.

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.852
I keep telling you
you're a girl.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.621
They're not mine,
they're my grandmother's.

01:03:14.021 --> 01:03:15.323
The one who died?

01:03:16.057 --> 01:03:17.693
Why do you have her clothes?

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.866
Why won't you talk to me?

01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:30.805
Did you kill Frederic?

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.707
Of course.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:36.778
You don't believe me.

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.448
- How did you get him up there?
- I didn't.

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.484
He got himself up there.

01:03:45.019 --> 01:03:47.256
Have you ever made yourself
feel good...

01:03:47.956 --> 01:03:50.158
by touching yourself?

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:53.261
You know, down there?

01:03:55.597 --> 01:03:57.165
I'll take that as a yes.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.535
In any case,
Frederic certainly did,

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:02.537
every chance he got,
even in class.

01:04:03.905 --> 01:04:05.707
But you, being a retard,

01:04:06.141 --> 01:04:07.742
apparently failed to notice.

01:04:08.175 --> 01:04:10.711
I, not being a retard,
certainly did.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.582
I told Frederic how much better
it feels to do that when...

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.483
well, when you can't breathe
while you're doing it.

01:04:17.485 --> 01:04:18.720
How do you know that?

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.586
When Frederic was going
to take a shower,

01:04:20.588 --> 01:04:22.621
I showed him how to tie
his belt around his neck

01:04:22.623 --> 01:04:25.193
and to put his feet up
on the sides of the tub.

01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:28.763
Told him I would
keep guard for him.

01:04:30.398 --> 01:04:32.900
Then, when I heard him
start to go at it,

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:36.939
I turned around, pushed his feet
off the tub and... ta-da.

01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:39.742
Well, you know the rest.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.243
But why?

01:04:43.144 --> 01:04:47.249
Because we needed a distraction
to get out of this place.

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:51.419
It was worth a try.

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:58.359
Why did you kill your brother...

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.429
and your mom?

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:02.830
Put them on.

01:05:03.965 --> 01:05:07.066
- What?
- Your grandma's clothes. Put them on.

01:05:07.068 --> 01:05:08.568
You've put them on before,
right?

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:10.472
I'm going to my room now,
Christine.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.340
- If you don't put them on, I'll kill Elwood.
- I'll stop you.

01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:17.578
You can try, but you can't watch
all the time.

01:05:17.612 --> 01:05:19.446
Why do you want me
to put them on?

01:05:20.148 --> 01:05:22.416
If I put them on, you promise
to leave Elwood alone?

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.349
- I promise.
- You fucking swear?

01:05:24.351 --> 01:05:26.554
I swear I won't harm Elwood.

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.434
Turn around.

01:05:42.103 --> 01:05:43.339
Close your eyes.

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:48.910
Okay.

01:05:56.418 --> 01:05:57.620
Wow.

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:00.856
Can I go now?

01:06:02.289 --> 01:06:03.925
Have you ever put on makeup?

01:06:04.092 --> 01:06:05.894
- Hell, no.
- Come here.

01:06:06.061 --> 01:06:07.930
- Hell, no!
- Jacob...

01:06:11.032 --> 01:06:14.266
You even walk like
a girl... sometimes.

01:06:14.268 --> 01:06:17.839
- I don't walk like a girl.
- Keep still, retard.

01:06:28.282 --> 01:06:30.952
You are, like, ten times
prettier than I am.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.253
Great.
Thanks for the compliment.

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.490
Can I go now?

01:06:35.123 --> 01:06:36.624
That's why they sent you here?

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.727
Somebody saw you
wearing her clothes.

01:06:39.994 --> 01:06:41.661
And dancing.
What a retard, right?

01:06:41.663 --> 01:06:42.865
You were dancing?

01:06:43.597 --> 01:06:44.932
Dancing, like how?

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:47.068
- I don't know.
- Show me.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:48.635
- No way!
- Show me, Jacob.

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.137
No fucking way, Christine.

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.670
You can kill everybody
in this fucking place,

01:06:51.672 --> 01:06:53.341
but I'm still not dancing
for you.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:57.078
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Turn around.

01:06:58.646 --> 01:06:59.881
Why?

01:07:00.481 --> 01:07:01.850
Turn around.

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.359
Now, close your eyes.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.801
Okay.

01:07:27.041 --> 01:07:28.376
Dance with me.

01:07:30.177 --> 01:07:31.412
I don't know how.

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:34.348
I do. It's called leading.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.151
I'll lead and you follow.

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:39.722
- We don't have music.
- What were you listening to...

01:07:40.822 --> 01:07:42.457
when they caught you dancing?

01:07:43.391 --> 01:07:44.760
I don't know.

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:46.694
Something old that my
grandmother used to listen to.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.030
How did it go?

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.732
- I don't remember.
- Yes, you do.

01:08:03.211 --> 01:08:04.847
That's tango music.

01:08:06.514 --> 01:08:08.383
You know tango music.

01:08:21.496 --> 01:08:23.631
Back, back,

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:26.100
back, side, side.

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:28.768
Back, back,

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.171
back, side, side.

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:33.542
Back, back.

01:08:36.176 --> 01:08:38.046
Back, back, back,

01:08:38.444 --> 01:08:40.647
back, side, step.

01:08:40.814 --> 01:08:42.684
Go like this when I tell you to.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:48.223
Now.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.562
Don't go.

01:09:27.862 --> 01:09:30.397
- What?
- Stay with me.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.497
So you can kill me
like you killed Frederic?

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.767
I didn't kill him.

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.734
- You said you did.
- I lied.

01:09:35.737 --> 01:09:38.640
Right. And you didn't just try to
stab me with the scissors either.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.809
I just wanted you to beat me up.

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:43.979
Why?

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.584
Because I love you.

01:09:49.783 --> 01:09:52.154
- You're crazy.
- Look in the mirror.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:54.089
You made me put this on.

01:09:54.655 --> 01:09:56.057
Want to know a secret?

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.790
What?

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:59.794
I loved you
the first time I saw you.

01:10:01.329 --> 01:10:02.529
Why?

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:05.733
Because you're the first person
I ever saw that I knew

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:09.303
no one could make do anything
he didn't want to, ever.

01:10:09.837 --> 01:10:12.806
You're crazy. All I ever do
is stuff I don't want to do.

01:10:12.873 --> 01:10:14.275
That's what you think.

01:10:15.976 --> 01:10:18.113
Want to stay with me
in my room tonight?

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:21.884
No.

01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:24.819
But you can stay in mine.

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:29.857
That's Andromeda.

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.262
That's the Milky Way.
That's where we live.

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:36.030
And that is Ursa Major.

01:10:36.698 --> 01:10:38.098
Or at least it would be,

01:10:38.265 --> 01:10:40.599
if Jacob had put the stars
where I told him to.

01:10:40.601 --> 01:10:42.535
I did put them there.
If you don't like it,

01:10:42.537 --> 01:10:45.607
next time don't be too chicken to sit
on the dresser and do it yourself.

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.244
Come down here with us, Phil.

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:51.980
Why?

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:54.816
'Cause it's more fun,
that's why.

01:10:56.684 --> 01:10:58.153
I'm okay up here.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.222
Don't make me ask again, Phil.

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:03.659
Bring your pillow.

01:11:17.337 --> 01:11:18.739
It's beautiful.

01:11:19.807 --> 01:11:21.840
Well, that's not the point.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:24.710
The point is for our work
to accurately represent

01:11:24.712 --> 01:11:26.612
an existing celestial system.
It's a...

01:11:26.614 --> 01:11:27.882
Shut up, Phil.

01:11:40.862 --> 01:11:43.065
I've never looked
at the stars at night.

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:48.302
If you kind of unfocus
your eyes,

01:11:48.569 --> 01:11:50.204
it almost looks like
the real thing.

01:14:00.735 --> 01:14:03.305
Elwood. Shit.

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:52.888
Elwood?

01:14:56.591 --> 01:14:57.826
Elwood?

01:15:04.265 --> 01:15:05.466
Elwood!

01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:08.003
Elwood!

01:15:54.015 --> 01:15:58.385
- <i>You did what?</i>
- <i>I did what needed to be done.</i>

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:05.092
<i>All right, then.
So, it ends tonight.</i>

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:35.120
<i>I won't be
spoken to like a child.</i>

01:16:35.122 --> 01:16:38.057
<i>There was no call
for what you did, Miss Adams.</i>

01:16:38.059 --> 01:16:39.959
<i>He said his
mother was coming any minute.</i>

01:16:39.961 --> 01:16:42.296
<i>She wanted to see him
and take him home.</i>

01:16:42.697 --> 01:16:44.466
<i>I told you
I would handle her.</i>

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:46.968
It's not her I'm worried about.

01:16:47.335 --> 01:16:48.535
Then what?

01:16:49.302 --> 01:16:51.506
It's clear to me
you're sentimental.

01:16:52.707 --> 01:16:53.942
Sentimental?

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.512
Because I'm concerned
with their souls?

01:16:58.012 --> 01:17:02.315
I have always been concerned
with the soul, Miss Adams,

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:05.686
and I have always delivered
on my contracts, always.

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:13.961
Get the boy stashed away,
Miss Adams, immediately,

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:17.298
while I prepare for the arrival
of his mother.

01:17:17.664 --> 01:17:19.734
I don't want any of the
other children to find him.

01:19:59.025 --> 01:20:00.360
Dr. Sherman.

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:12.565
Mrs. Ramsay,
nice to see you again.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:15.869
Let's discuss this in my office.
Right this way.

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:19.638
- Where's Elwood?
- Please, have a seat, Mrs. Ramsay.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.406
You told me I could see Elwood.

01:21:21.408 --> 01:21:24.376
Please, may I offer you a drink,
Mrs. Ramsay?

01:21:24.378 --> 01:21:28.882
- I just want to see Elwood.
- Mm. How quickly things change.

01:21:29.617 --> 01:21:31.983
Not long ago, you sat
in my office in Stamford

01:21:31.985 --> 01:21:34.085
and expressed sentiments
very much to the contrary

01:21:34.087 --> 01:21:35.722
and in no uncertain terms.

01:21:36.957 --> 01:21:40.026
In fact, you signed a contract,
one which I co-signed,

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.260
and as you well know,
Mrs. Ramsay,

01:21:42.262 --> 01:21:44.265
I never back out on a contract.

01:21:47.034 --> 01:21:49.937
You've been on the road
for a long time, Mrs. Ramsay.

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:01.982
I was experiencing
a moment of weakness.

01:22:02.448 --> 01:22:06.553
It's been so difficult
since Donald left.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:10.491
Being alone with Elwood
all the time...

01:22:11.158 --> 01:22:13.860
You could have sent him
to an institution...

01:22:14.627 --> 01:22:17.363
a special school,
as I suggested...

01:22:18.064 --> 01:22:20.333
where he would be cared for
with other children

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:22.601
like himself,
but you chose otherwise.

01:22:22.603 --> 01:22:26.440
- Please, Dr. Sherman...
- It's too late, in any case.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.909
I couldn't grant your wish
if I wanted to.

01:22:33.713 --> 01:22:35.749
But you said he was still...

01:22:44.692 --> 01:22:48.928
- How?
- Mrs. Ramsay, as you remember,

01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:52.330
we agreed the less you know,
the better.

01:22:52.332 --> 01:22:55.701
Can I see his body one last...

01:22:55.703 --> 01:22:56.970
I'm afraid not.

01:22:57.738 --> 01:22:59.339
The other children, are they...

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:00.708
The less you know...

01:23:01.475 --> 01:23:03.610
the better.

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:07.781
I... I imagine you made it appear
like some sort of accident...

01:23:08.615 --> 01:23:10.551
but somehow I thought
you would...

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:13.554
take care of them all at once.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.392
I'm not a stupid woman,
Dr. Sherman.

01:23:19.426 --> 01:23:20.692
No.

01:23:20.694 --> 01:23:23.029
However poorly Elwood
might reflect on me...

01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:26.100
I understand
how you can...

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:28.767
explain away one accident,

01:23:28.769 --> 01:23:31.503
but... but how are you going
to make believe seven...

01:23:31.505 --> 01:23:34.107
That's enough, Mrs. Ramsay.

01:23:35.074 --> 01:23:38.546
This is not my first contract.
Far from it.

01:23:38.779 --> 01:23:40.614
Nor will it be my last.

01:23:41.614 --> 01:23:44.051
Allow me to worry
about the details.

01:23:45.752 --> 01:23:48.421
The others are still alive,
aren't they?

01:23:48.588 --> 01:23:51.426
It's getting late, Mrs. Ramsay,
and...

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.395
you've a long drive back
to the city.

01:23:54.695 --> 01:23:57.497
I'm... I'm staying
in a hotel in Waterbury.

01:23:57.631 --> 01:24:00.134
By the river.
It's a beautiful view.

01:24:01.101 --> 01:24:03.003
It's just an hour's drive
from here.

01:24:09.176 --> 01:24:12.779
I confess I feel...
suddenly light.

01:24:14.148 --> 01:24:18.753
As if a great weight
has been lifted from my heart.

01:24:22.722 --> 01:24:24.057
Is that terrible?

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:28.863
It's not for me
to judge these things.

01:24:30.463 --> 01:24:31.899
I'm glad for you.

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.043
I'll see myself out.

01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:45.480
Very well, Mrs. Ramsay.

01:24:47.113 --> 01:24:49.916
Take care.
Have a safe drive back.

01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:06.033
That was
uncalled for, Ms. Adams.

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:09.971
For the second time tonight.

01:25:11.305 --> 01:25:14.208
- She was gonna tell someone.
- Of course she was.

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:16.811
That's why
I'd already killed her.

01:25:19.146 --> 01:25:22.650
Three drops of tricyclic
amitriptyline in her drink...

01:25:22.716 --> 01:25:26.151
in a posthumous medical examination,
completely indistinguishable

01:25:26.153 --> 01:25:30.124
from the painkillers Mrs. Ramsay
was addicted to.

01:25:32.592 --> 01:25:35.660
She wouldn't have called anyone till
tomorrow morning at the earliest,

01:25:35.662 --> 01:25:39.498
and within four to six hours,
she would've been dead.

01:25:39.533 --> 01:25:42.470
Accidental overdose,
apparent suicide...

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:44.906
not a missing person...

01:25:45.739 --> 01:25:47.740
or a scarred-up corpse.

01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:50.809
How do you know how long
she would've waited to call?

01:25:50.811 --> 01:25:54.248
Because, Ms. Adams,
unlike yourself...

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.551
I'm a professional.

01:26:41.628 --> 01:26:44.330
Claude,
there's a situation developing.

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:46.267
Could you come up
to the house immediately?

01:26:51.872 --> 01:26:55.743
The problem with Ms. Adams is that
she came to this work late in life.

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:01.883
Jacob?

01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:06.654
You can come out
of that closet now.

01:27:31.712 --> 01:27:35.479
She was new to my employ, despite
appearances to the contrary.

01:27:35.481 --> 01:27:37.717
In this line of work,
it's best to start young.

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:40.620
I was just a little older
than you are now, when I...

01:27:41.287 --> 01:27:42.856
took on my first job.

01:27:44.490 --> 01:27:45.726
Are you gonna kill me?

01:27:47.961 --> 01:27:49.230
Give me a hand.

01:27:53.333 --> 01:27:54.769
Grab her feet, will you?

01:28:04.811 --> 01:28:06.346
This basement's getting
pretty crowded.

01:28:07.046 --> 01:28:09.148
We're not going to the basement.

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:14.754
Your people are expert at employing
levity under adverse circumstances.

01:28:14.756 --> 01:28:17.024
Integral to your resilience,
I'm sure.

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:18.926
Now...

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.062
how should we pose her?

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.929
On the stairs,
trying to escape the smoke,

01:28:24.931 --> 01:28:28.401
or fallen at the foot
of the stairs,

01:28:28.702 --> 01:28:32.640
bravely trying to rescue our
young charges from the flames?

01:28:32.939 --> 01:28:34.140
Flames?

01:28:34.707 --> 01:28:37.741
The flames from the tragic fire

01:28:37.743 --> 01:28:41.381
that burned down Sherman's Boarding
School and everyone in it.

01:28:42.582 --> 01:28:45.285
- Including Dr. and Mrs. Sherman.
- That's right.

01:28:48.921 --> 01:28:50.156
Who are you?

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.305
That would be Claude.

01:29:04.971 --> 01:29:08.005
Let him in, would you, Jacob,
and show him to Ms. Adams' body?

01:29:08.007 --> 01:29:09.409
I'll be back in a moment.

01:29:30.796 --> 01:29:32.800
Dr. Sherman said there was a...

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:35.069
a problem?

01:29:35.935 --> 01:29:37.470
Yeah. This way.

01:29:49.449 --> 01:29:50.717
Lynn?

01:29:51.417 --> 01:29:53.319
What the hell...

01:29:53.753 --> 01:29:56.222
Excuse me, Jacob.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.035
He came as a package
with Ms. Adams.

01:30:10.003 --> 01:30:11.739
Grab his leg.

01:30:13.172 --> 01:30:14.507
Here we go.

01:30:16.609 --> 01:30:17.912
There we go.

01:30:21.113 --> 01:30:23.816
Uh, a little further,
Jacob, a little further.

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:27.455
Here we are.
That's good.

01:30:34.994 --> 01:30:38.531
What do you think? Panicked,
running from the fire,

01:30:38.832 --> 01:30:40.534
cabinet collapsed on top of him.

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.401
I guess.

01:30:42.802 --> 01:30:45.169
I was hoping to arrive at this
moment later in the week,

01:30:45.171 --> 01:30:48.975
but schedules do tend
to be theoretical.

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:53.180
Wondering why
I waited this long?

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:55.981
Would've looked kind of
suspicious if you got here,

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:58.083
and the place burned up
the very next day.

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.320
Very good.

01:30:59.819 --> 01:31:01.354
It would have indeed.

01:31:03.123 --> 01:31:05.126
Do you... do you do this a lot?

01:31:05.591 --> 01:31:07.160
Yes, Jacob.

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.530
It's my job.

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:15.002
Methods are always different,
but...

01:31:15.569 --> 01:31:18.372
the result, always the same.

01:31:20.173 --> 01:31:21.475
Speaking of which...

01:31:24.711 --> 01:31:27.580
what do we do with Ms. Adams?

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:30.150
- Why should I help you?
- Excuse me?

01:31:30.216 --> 01:31:32.452
Why should I help you if you're
gonna kill me anyways?

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:37.222
My agreement with
your stepfather stipulated

01:31:37.224 --> 01:31:40.157
that you are never again
to return home

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:42.962
to distress him or your mother.

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.365
Now, being a businessman,

01:31:45.865 --> 01:31:50.203
I always allow myself plenty of latitude
in the execution of my agreements.

01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:55.275
Did... did my mom think this was
a real boarding school?

01:31:56.944 --> 01:31:59.346
My agreement
was with your stepfather.

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:03.450
I can't speak as to what
he might or...

01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:05.551
might not...

01:32:05.886 --> 01:32:07.621
have told your mother.

01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:11.425
If I help you now,

01:32:12.591 --> 01:32:14.160
will you let me help you again?

01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:23.070
Facing the stairs.

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.351
Hello, Doctor.

01:32:57.003 --> 01:32:58.271
Here we are, Jacob.

01:32:58.939 --> 01:33:00.274
Yes.

01:33:00.707 --> 01:33:02.176
Step aside, Jacob.

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:14.655
I will pose Mrs. Ramsay
appropriately and, uh...

01:33:15.088 --> 01:33:16.457
get things started.

01:33:16.957 --> 01:33:19.226
You think you can handle
Frederic by yourself?

01:33:19.759 --> 01:33:20.994
What about Elwood?

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:22.463
Elwood?

01:33:23.329 --> 01:33:24.931
Do you want to carry Elwood?

01:33:57.698 --> 01:33:58.966
You know what this is?

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:03.303
- Alcohol?
- Sodium acetate.

01:34:06.405 --> 01:34:07.675
Once lit...

01:34:13.113 --> 01:34:16.015
it's completely
indistinguishable...

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.153
from the residue...

01:34:21.988 --> 01:34:23.757
left by a normal fire.

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.346
Now, you know what this is?

01:34:46.746 --> 01:34:47.780
A key?

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:49.650
For the rooms upstairs.

01:34:50.817 --> 01:34:53.019
I want you to lock all the doors

01:34:53.185 --> 01:34:55.288
before the others attempt
an escape.

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.223
And then when you're done,
you and me,

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:00.227
we'll leave this place together.

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:02.563
That's not what I would do
if I was you.

01:35:03.029 --> 01:35:04.298
No? What would you do?

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:07.601
I would give me the keys
so I'd go upstairs,

01:35:08.068 --> 01:35:09.468
set the stairs on fire...

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:13.674
walk out, lock the door, and
watch us all burn up in here.

01:35:15.975 --> 01:35:19.445
You're a very cunning
people, Jacob,

01:35:19.845 --> 01:35:21.180
as well as clever.

01:35:22.949 --> 01:35:27.453
But honor is clearly not your
strongest suit. I told you...

01:35:28.121 --> 01:35:30.089
I intend you no harm.

01:35:31.024 --> 01:35:33.260
Are you saying that
you don't believe me?

01:35:34.927 --> 01:35:36.195
I believe you.

01:35:39.899 --> 01:35:41.100
There you go.

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:51.345
Jacob...

01:35:54.881 --> 01:35:56.683
Jacob! Wait a minute, Jacob.

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.517
I can't see. I want to talk
to you a second.

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:00.120
Jacob, what are you doing?

01:36:03.422 --> 01:36:06.126
Jacob!

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.360
Don't you dare!

01:36:09.261 --> 01:36:14.499
- Sorry, Dr. Sherman.
- I'm not Dr. Sherman. I'm...

01:36:14.501 --> 01:36:16.602
I don't care who you are!

01:36:19.038 --> 01:36:20.472
You told me to look out
for the others.

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:21.809
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:36:23.243 --> 01:36:25.879
You're... dead.

01:36:44.497 --> 01:36:45.699
Jacob?

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:50.838
He was gonna kill all of you.

01:36:53.038 --> 01:36:55.876
No duh. We should
get out of here.

01:36:57.144 --> 01:36:59.713
I can't let Phil burn up
for a second time, Christine.

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:03.115
Dr. Sherman's gonna
get up again.

01:37:04.150 --> 01:37:07.386
No, he won't. Go wake the others.
I'll be there in a minute.

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:09.455
Go!

01:37:50.029 --> 01:37:51.495
Phil, why are you
standing there?

01:37:51.497 --> 01:37:53.498
- I am not going down there. I'm not.
- They won't go.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:56.168
- There's a fire down there.
- I know there's a fire.

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:57.771
- Why are you in a dress?
- Come here.

01:37:58.238 --> 01:38:00.071
Go downstairs and out through
the front door.

01:38:00.073 --> 01:38:01.238
I don't wanna
go down there.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.241
- Move it, morons!
- Where are we going?

01:38:03.243 --> 01:38:05.212
I need you to help me
get one last thing.

01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:08.815
Jacob,
what are you doing?

01:38:09.048 --> 01:38:12.619
<i>Let me out! Let me out of here!</i>

01:38:13.186 --> 01:38:15.486
<i>Let me out!</i>

01:38:15.488 --> 01:38:17.490
<i>Jacob, why are you
doing this to me?</i>

01:38:18.358 --> 01:38:19.760
'Cause you killed Frederic.

01:38:20.894 --> 01:38:23.363
<i>I told you I was lying to you.</i>

01:38:24.163 --> 01:38:25.364
No, you weren't.

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:30.403
<i>I was trying
to get out of here, Jacob.</i>

01:38:30.636 --> 01:38:33.239
<i>I was trying to get you out too.</i>

01:38:34.608 --> 01:38:35.842
I know.

01:38:37.277 --> 01:38:38.779
<i>I love you, Jacob.</i>

01:38:39.479 --> 01:38:40.681
Yeah.

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.716
That's why I showed you
Phil's galaxy.

01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:46.150
Bye, Christine.

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:20.047
I'm Phil's friend now.

01:40:21.247 --> 01:40:22.715
If anything happens to him...

01:40:23.248 --> 01:40:24.517
you'll be sorry.

01:41:23.275 --> 01:41:26.680
We spoke with your old school, and they
said they'd be happy to take you back.

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:32.017
We were thinking
you could use a break

01:41:32.318 --> 01:41:35.187
before going back to school right away.
Go on a vacation...

01:41:36.355 --> 01:41:38.423
for a few months with us,
just the three of us.

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:41.828
We were thinking
we could go to Paris,

01:41:42.194 --> 01:41:43.662
so you can speak French.

01:41:44.796 --> 01:41:46.065
Cool.

01:41:49.569 --> 01:41:51.438
Why don't you eat your mashies?

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:54.673
You helped me so nicely
in the kitchen.

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:57.843
I'm not hungry.

01:42:01.847 --> 01:42:04.450
Mom, I'm really tired.

01:42:06.752 --> 01:42:07.988
Oh, of course.

01:42:08.587 --> 01:42:10.055
Go to bed, sweetheart.

01:42:19.365 --> 01:42:21.199
You can leave the light on
if you like.

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.602
Mom, don't worry about it.

01:43:58.564 --> 01:43:59.765
Feiga.

01:44:49.314 --> 01:44:52.251
<i>Move, honey!
Why aren't you moving?</i>

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:56.156
<i>Davis! Davis,
you have to move!</i>

01:44:56.957 --> 01:44:58.324
<i>Please!</i>

01:44:58.791 --> 01:45:00.927
<i>Please, honey,
you have to move!</i>

01:45:51.846 --> 01:45:56.846
