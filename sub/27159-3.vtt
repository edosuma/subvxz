00:05.600 --> 00:08.300
What happened to your breasts
during the healing process?

00:08.333 --> 00:10.233
I got necrosis.
Wow.

00:10.266 --> 00:11.467
Have I ever lost a nipple?

00:11.500 --> 00:14.266
No. You wanna be my first?

00:14.300 --> 00:15.266
When I was in surgery,

00:15.300 --> 00:17.100
I woke up on the table

00:17.133 --> 00:20.467
because I heard the doctor
and the anesthesiologist,

00:20.500 --> 00:22.233
they were screaming
at each other.

00:22.266 --> 00:23.533
That's not the worst part.

00:23.567 --> 00:25.500
Oh...

00:25.533 --> 00:26.500

00:26.533 --> 00:28.266
and you might remember me

00:28.300 --> 00:29.500
from 16 And Pregnant.

00:29.533 --> 00:32.066
I met a plastic surgeon,

00:32.100 --> 00:36.033
and if I allowed my surgery
to be live streamed,

00:36.066 --> 00:38.066
then he would do it for free.
Wow.

00:53.567 --> 00:55.600
They look insane.
They look crazy.

00:55.633 --> 00:58.133
Mm-mm, they're bad.

00:58.166 --> 01:01.100
When I was younger,
I experienced bullying,

01:01.133 --> 01:04.266
being told that
I was fat or ugly.

01:04.300 --> 01:07.266
I think subconsciously
the bullying
got me to a point

01:07.300 --> 01:10.400
where I just keep trying
to make myself look better.

01:10.433 --> 01:13.200
I've always wanted
to get breast implants.

01:13.233 --> 01:15.166
I mean, I always was
really small.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.033
I've never filled a bra.

01:17.066 --> 01:20.433
I went at least six
or seven consultations.

01:20.467 --> 01:23.066
The doctor
that I ended up going to,

01:23.100 --> 01:25.266
I got a personal recommendation
for him.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.467
My friend's surgery turned out
really great,

01:27.500 --> 01:29.533
so I had no reason not
to believe in him.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.500
24 hours after the surgery,

01:31.533 --> 01:35.066
when I took the bandages
off of the nipple,

01:35.100 --> 01:38.100
it kind of felt like I ripped
a little bit of skin off.

01:38.133 --> 01:42.567
The next day, when I woke up,
the spots were completely black.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.266
It felt like it looked like
zombie boobs.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.433
So I sent a picture
to my surgeon.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.567
He told me that
it was necrosis.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.166
I didn't lose a lot of tissue
because we caught it so early.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.200
But we had to take
the implants out.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.667
Yeah.

01:58.700 --> 02:03.400
To fix it, my surgeon wanted
to do a fat transfer.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.533
When he told me that he had to
do liposuction on my stomach,

02:05.567 --> 02:08.700
I was like,
"Yes, a two for one."

02:08.734 --> 02:11.600
He took enough fat
to thicken up the areas

02:11.633 --> 02:13.467
that developed necrosis

02:13.500 --> 02:15.467
so that once the implant
was behind them again,

02:15.500 --> 02:16.633
it wouldn't get necrosis again.

02:16.667 --> 02:20.200
My last surgery
was about 10 months ago,

02:20.233 --> 02:23.133
and he put the implants back in.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.233
I had a post-op appointment
with my surgeon,

02:25.266 --> 02:26.467
and I opened up
the hospital gown,

02:26.500 --> 02:27.700
and he looked at them

02:27.734 --> 02:30.333
and said that they
were healing well,

02:30.367 --> 02:32.467
so that they were looking good.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.667
And that's when I was like,

02:34.700 --> 02:37.200
"Okay, if he thinks
this looks good,
then I'm in trouble."

02:37.233 --> 02:40.633
They're clearly,
clearly not good.

02:40.667 --> 02:44.500
The amount that I had to
emotionally push all of this
under the rug

02:44.533 --> 02:46.400
in order for it to be fine,

02:46.433 --> 02:48.333
made me a little too good

02:48.367 --> 02:50.100
at being able to push
things under the rug

02:50.133 --> 02:51.133
to be fine.

02:51.166 --> 02:54.233
It completely changed my life.

02:54.266 --> 02:57.567
Dating pretty much came
to a complete halt.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.667
And with that just came
the decision

02:59.700 --> 03:04.367
that I don't wanna be intimate
with somebody until I'm married.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.533
Feel like I don't know
of any other doctor

03:06.567 --> 03:08.567
that's as experienced
as Dr. Dubrow

03:08.600 --> 03:10.533
in terms of
reconstructing something

03:10.567 --> 03:15.133
that in my case
is incredibly difficult.

03:15.166 --> 03:18.400
With Dr. Dubrow,
it's all just gonna go away.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.700
I just want it to go away.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.500
My name's Michelle.

03:22.533 --> 03:25.433
I feel like Edward Scissorhands
operated on my face.

03:25.467 --> 03:29.333
I definitely have a more manly,
non-feminine jaw.

03:29.367 --> 03:33.367
It's very square, very choppy.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.133
I have always had
a double chin.

03:35.166 --> 03:39.567
I have been hiding my chin
since a young child.

03:39.600 --> 03:44.533
To hide my chin in photos, I've
used ice cream cones, lollypops,

03:44.567 --> 03:47.433
my dog, anything.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.667
I was always self conscious
of that.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.200
So when I was 37,
I went to a doctor,
see what he could do,

03:54.233 --> 03:56.400
I found my surgeon online.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.200
I felt very comfortable
with him.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.700
And he convinced me
to do an implant.

04:00.734 --> 04:05.467
He also convinced me
to have liposuction.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.000
I wanted to look better,

04:07.033 --> 04:08.767
so I went ahead
and had the procedure.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.467
When I was in surgery,
I woke up on the table

04:11.500 --> 04:15.200
because I heard the doctor
and the anesthesiologist,

04:15.233 --> 04:16.633
they were screaming
at each other.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.767
And I asked the doctor,
"Are we done?"

04:19.000 --> 04:21.533
And he, like, touched
my chin area

04:21.567 --> 04:23.567
and said, "Go back to sleep,"

04:23.600 --> 04:26.433
and I did.
I knocked out again.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.166
A week later, when he
un-bandaged me and revealed
my face,

04:30.200 --> 04:31.567
it was a nightmare.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.567
My chin was huge,

04:33.600 --> 04:37.300
and I had incisions over here,

04:37.333 --> 04:40.333
and then the one from the
implant, which is right here,

04:40.367 --> 04:43.333
and I had a scar going
all the way down here.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.000
I felt like I was a monster.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.700
He said, "Don't worry about it.
You're swollen.

04:47.734 --> 04:50.033
Give it time to heal.

04:50.066 --> 04:51.467
It never healed.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.300
And I just had to learn
to live with it.

04:54.333 --> 04:58.367
There's not like a return
policy on your chin.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.734
Being the owner
of a hair salon,

05:00.767 --> 05:05.300
people look at me
as the face of my hair salon.

05:05.333 --> 05:08.333
and this has affected
me tremendously

05:08.367 --> 05:12.266
because I can't really focus
on a lot of other things

05:12.300 --> 05:15.500
because I'm focusing on if
somebody's looking at my chin.

05:15.533 --> 05:17.200

what all has to be done,

06:26.300 --> 06:30.600
but excited to, like, finally
get a really good opinion.

06:30.633 --> 06:32.734
Take us back to the beginning.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.500
In the very beginning,
before I started anything,

06:35.533 --> 06:37.567
I went to multiple consultations

06:37.600 --> 06:40.533
and all of them determined
that it was a tuberous breast.
Okay.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.467
Tuberous breasts are
a genetic deformity

06:43.500 --> 06:45.667
where the back of the breast
is very narrow

06:45.700 --> 06:47.266
and the front
of the breast is very wide.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.633
What did they tell you?

06:48.667 --> 06:51.667
That they had to reduce
the area around the nipple.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.100
The doctor
that I ended up going to,

06:54.133 --> 06:55.100
he didn't bring that up.

06:55.133 --> 06:56.667
That's a red flag.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.400
When you have a group of
surgeons and a majority opinion,

06:59.433 --> 07:01.133
the majority's usually right.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.467
What happened to your breasts
during the healing process?

07:03.500 --> 07:04.567
I got necrosis.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.633
Wow. Devastating.

07:06.667 --> 07:09.667
What was the reason that the
skin died, did he tell you?

07:09.700 --> 07:11.033
He didn't tell me any.

07:11.066 --> 07:12.133
Then what happened?

07:12.166 --> 07:13.767
He just wanted to do
a fat transfer,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.367
so that when it was time for him
to go put the implant back in,

07:17.400 --> 07:19.066
it would have, like,
extra tissue there.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.600
Okay, I mean, that's an idea.

07:21.633 --> 07:26.433
Fat transfers have
a very limited utility,

07:26.467 --> 07:28.433
and I only like to put them

07:28.467 --> 07:29.567
in certain areas of the face

07:29.600 --> 07:31.300
like the nasolabial folds

07:31.333 --> 07:33.333
and sometimes the lips.

07:33.367 --> 07:36.367
So were you self conscious
before-- about your breasts

07:36.400 --> 07:37.533
before you had
any breast surgery?

07:37.567 --> 07:40.600
She's very-- a personal person.

07:40.633 --> 07:42.533
She likes to keep things
to herself.

07:42.567 --> 07:43.734
Doesn't show her emotions
that well.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.633
Yeah, but you can tell.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.033
I can see that, yeah.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.567
What are your goals?

07:48.600 --> 07:51.000
The nipple area that still
hasn't been taken car of.

07:51.033 --> 07:53.567
And I also want it to actually
look like I have breast
implants.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.533
So I wanna go
a little bit bigger

07:55.567 --> 07:59.367

07:59.400 --> 08:03.033
By the way, I was going,
"Don't say it. Don't do it.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.033
No, Shannon."

08:05.066 --> 08:08.000
I'm concerned that Shannon may
have unrealistic expectations.

08:08.033 --> 08:10.400
She just assumes
I'm gonna make it perfect.

08:10.433 --> 08:14.066
and she's just picking
a size like she's picking
a dress off the rack.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.433
This is a challenging case.
This is a very challenging case.

08:18.667 --> 08:21.133
Where the scar tissue was,
he cut it out.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.033
That's why I have a scar going
all the way up.

08:23.066 --> 08:25.433
He cut on the outside
of your neck?

08:25.467 --> 08:28.433
This was the wrong procedure,
the wrong approach,

[Dr. Dubrow]
So how does this work?

08:31.133 --> 08:32.500
Liquid nitrogen comes in,

08:32.533 --> 08:34.066
turns it into cold air.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.433
Maybe you'll go in
looking like this

08:36.467 --> 08:38.367
and come out looking like this.

All right, flex your pecs now.

08:53.233 --> 08:57.033
Look at that. That was probably
her original breast bud
was right there.

08:57.066 --> 09:00.266
So this is old.
This is dead fat.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.233
So all that fat transfer
did was die.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.667
For fat transfer
to the breast to work

09:05.700 --> 09:07.700
the fat has to be good,

09:07.734 --> 09:09.734
and the tissue you're
transferring it to

09:09.767 --> 09:11.266
has to have good blood supply

09:12.767 --> 09:15.100
that is absolutely
not going to work

The breast tissue loss
that you have

09:43.266 --> 09:45.233
from the original operation

09:45.266 --> 09:47.533
means the blood supply coming
into the nipple

09:47.567 --> 09:49.700
is not that robust.

09:49.734 --> 09:51.533
This is a risky procedure.

09:51.567 --> 09:54.200
I could lose your nipples
with this.

09:54.233 --> 09:55.600
Have I ever lost a nipple?

09:55.633 --> 09:59.033
No. You wanna be my first?

09:59.066 --> 10:02.166
It's terrifying.
I would like to breastfeed
my children.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.233
Stuff like that goes
through my mind.

10:04.266 --> 10:08.100
It's much larger than what's
just here right now.

10:08.133 --> 10:09.700
I know what your goal is.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.300
You want to be filled out

10:11.333 --> 10:12.600
so when you're in clothes,

10:12.633 --> 10:14.233
it looks like you've got
breasts.

10:14.266 --> 10:15.767
You want a breast implant look,

10:16.000 --> 10:20.033
meaning you want a breast
augmentation,

10:20.066 --> 10:21.700
but, in terms of size,

10:21.734 --> 10:25.033
if you want me to do
your surgery,

10:25.066 --> 10:26.767
I rarely say this to patients,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
it's up to me what size we use.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.633
That's my call.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.100
And if that's not acceptable,

10:32.133 --> 10:34.033
that's a deal breaker.
It's up to me.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.734
I need Shannon to temper
her expectations,

10:36.767 --> 10:38.667
and she really needs
to understand

10:38.700 --> 10:43.133
she probably won't get exactly
what her dream result is

10:43.166 --> 10:45.033
from this surgical procedure.

10:45.066 --> 10:47.033
It's just scary.

10:47.066 --> 10:50.300
It is scary.
This is big-time
high-risk surgery.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.734
But the good news is you're in
now in someone's hands

10:52.767 --> 10:54.567
that is very good at this.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.233
There's a greater chance of your
breasts looking a lot better

10:57.266 --> 11:00.266
than you having a problem
with your nipples.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.233
What do you think, Shannon?

11:08.400 --> 11:10.700
It affects
my entire personality.

11:10.734 --> 11:12.367
Right.
And I don't want that anymore.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.300
I just wanna feel like normal.
Normal.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.567
Normal.
You wanna do the surgery?

11:17.600 --> 11:18.767
Yeah.
You sure?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.033
Can I see a smile,
big, big smile?

11:21.066 --> 11:23.700
Look at that face?
Huh?

11:23.734 --> 11:26.667
Just package these
to go together.
You know what I mean?

11:26.700 --> 11:28.700
Let's fix this, get married,

11:28.734 --> 11:31.100
and bring on milkdom.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.700
My name's Lindsey,
I'm 22,

11:35.734 --> 11:37.300
and you might remember me

11:37.333 --> 11:38.700
from 16 And Pregnant.

11:38.734 --> 11:42.266
And my boobs got huge
on social media.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.667
At the age of 13,

11:43.700 --> 11:45.633
my mom and stepdad
got a divorce.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.266
I went from living
in a super structured household

11:48.300 --> 11:52.367
to overnight not having to ask
to do a single thing.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.266
I just had very little
supervision.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.266
I could go anywhere at any time,

11:56.300 --> 12:00.200
and I got involved with a guy

12:00.233 --> 12:02.734
that I definitely
shouldn't have.

12:02.767 --> 12:05.033
Yeah. Oh, my God.

12:05.066 --> 12:07.033
Three years
into the relationship

12:07.066 --> 12:10.133
I'm pregnant at 16 years old.

12:10.166 --> 12:13.300
Everyone kept saying,
"You better get an abortion."

12:13.333 --> 12:17.200
Ugh, I hate thinking about that.

12:17.233 --> 12:21.367
Just crazy that people could
tell someone to get an abortion.

12:21.400 --> 12:25.734
I said to myself,
"She's mine
and I'm keeping her."

12:25.767 --> 12:28.000
I was about
three months pregnant,

12:28.033 --> 12:30.266
and I saw 16 And Pregnant,

12:30.300 --> 12:31.367
so I just wrote in,

12:31.400 --> 12:32.767
and then the next thing I know,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.633
I have a film crew
following me around.

12:35.667 --> 12:38.100
So I gave birth
to my daughter Anaya.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.233
Anaya is a total Mini-Me.

12:40.266 --> 12:42.233
She's my whole world.
We do everything together.

12:42.266 --> 12:44.467
And my daughter's
biological dad,

12:44.500 --> 12:47.300
and is really no longer
part of our lives anymore.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.367
I now live in Texas

12:48.400 --> 12:50.200
with my amazing husband TJ.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.700
TJ actually watched
my episode on day.

12:52.734 --> 12:54.233
He found me attractive

12:54.266 --> 12:57.000
and so he went onto
my Facebook page

12:57.033 --> 12:58.700
and sent me a friend request.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.734
Ever since then we've never
stopped talking.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.400
When I was pregnant with Anaya,

13:03.433 --> 13:07.333
I loved how my breasts
became so big.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.200
I mean, I went from an A cup

13:09.233 --> 13:11.266
to, like, a double D, triple D.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.333
After I stopped breast feeding,

13:13.367 --> 13:14.734
whoop, deflated.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.667
Because I was on
16 And Pregnant,

13:16.700 --> 13:18.266
an opportunity came along,

13:18.300 --> 13:20.133
and there was a doctor

13:20.166 --> 13:24.133
who was willing to give me
a free breast augmentation

13:24.166 --> 13:27.300
if I allowed him
to live stream the surgery

13:27.333 --> 13:28.500
on social media.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.700
I started doing
lots of research.

13:30.734 --> 13:34.000
This was no backhouse
free plastic surgery.

13:34.033 --> 13:35.700
This in my eyes was gonna be

13:35.734 --> 13:38.266
from one of the top plastic
surgeons in America.

13:38.300 --> 13:42.400
And all I have to do is
let him live stream
my surgery on Snapchat

13:42.433 --> 13:45.266
like he does almost every other
girl that he does.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.133
It was kind of a no brainer.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.467
So I agreed to do the surgery.

13:49.500 --> 13:54.300
I had showed him a picture of
the breasts that I kind of
wanted mine to resemble,

13:54.333 --> 13:57.166
and he said that
was definitely 800 ccs,

13:57.200 --> 13:59.533
the biggest implants legal.

13:59.567 --> 14:02.333
So after I'm in the surgery,
I wake up,

14:02.367 --> 14:05.734
and it was the look
that I had been hoping for.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.200
I had big boobs.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.166
But shortly after, I realized

14:09.200 --> 14:11.467
I have this weird shooting pain
throughout them.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.066
They fall into my back.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.200
And it's impossible
to find bras that fit me.

14:16.233 --> 14:20.066
They're too big.
The struggle is real.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.500
There was a ball here,

14:21.533 --> 14:24.266
and he said
that this was scar tissue.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.500
Scar tissue immediately
after surgery?

14:26.533 --> 14:31.700
The surgical procedure
caused the tissue to die.

14:31.734 --> 14:34.367
Oh, look at that.
Ooh, whoa, hello.

Uh-oh, hold on. Hold on.

15:13.066 --> 15:15.200
About 35 minutes.

35 minutes to shave all this?
There's hair everywhere.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.233
Really?
I did it for you, my brother.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.300
Who did your back for you?

15:20.333 --> 15:21.600
The housekeeper.

You had the housekeeper shave
your back?

15:23.166 --> 15:24.700
Yeah. Well, yeah.

15:24.734 --> 15:28.600
I'm surprised Paul got his
housekeeper to shave his back.

Normally he gets the zookeeper.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.233
[Dr. Dubrow]
So how does this work?

15:34.266 --> 15:35.467
Liquid nitrogen comes in,

15:35.500 --> 15:37.333
turns it into cold air,

15:37.367 --> 15:39.600
it goes in a vortex
around you in there.

15:39.633 --> 15:41.367
So we're covering our feet,
our hands,

and shorts on.

You got some shorts on.

But is that good enough?
Or would we need something like
a little...

You want a sock

about doing this,

has been done

17:09.266 --> 17:10.734
who had some type
of chin surgery,

17:10.767 --> 17:13.166
and now apparently
she has some irregularities.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.133
Okay.
And that's about
as much as I know.

Can you please send in Michelle?

17:25.600 --> 17:26.700

Hi.

17:26.734 --> 17:28.400
Dr. Nassif.
Nice to meet you.

17:28.433 --> 17:29.767
Dr. Nassif is adorable.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.200
Up close, far away, all--
he's perfection.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.266
We'd love to hear your story
about your chin and your neck.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.000
Okay. So I went in
to the doctor.

17:40.033 --> 17:41.467
He looked at my chin area,

17:41.500 --> 17:42.567
and there was, like,
a double chin

17:42.600 --> 17:43.734
and some loose skin,

17:43.767 --> 17:46.300
so he said that I should put
an implant

17:46.333 --> 17:50.233
and I should get
some liposuction around
my face and stuff.

17:50.266 --> 17:51.433
What kind of doctor was he?

17:51.467 --> 17:53.633
He is a board-certified
plastic surgeon.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.300
Okay.

17:55.333 --> 17:58.700
Two days after,
he took the bandage off to see,

17:58.734 --> 18:03.233
and immediately there was
a little lump here,

18:03.266 --> 18:05.667
and then there was a ball here,

18:05.700 --> 18:08.700
and he said that
this was scar tissue

18:08.734 --> 18:11.033
and this, he wasn't sure
what this was.

18:11.066 --> 18:13.367
Scar tissue immediately
after surgery?

18:13.400 --> 18:17.333
Scar tissue does not form
that quickly after surgery.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.467
If Michelle had a wound problem,

18:19.500 --> 18:21.600
it was because
the surgical procedure

18:21.633 --> 18:25.367
reduced the blood supply
to the overlying soft tissue

18:25.400 --> 18:28.266
and caused the tissue to die.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.667
How's the feeling around here?

18:29.700 --> 18:31.500
This side is always
a little bit tender,

18:31.533 --> 18:33.367
and that's where he said
the scar tissue was.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.734
He cut it out,

18:34.767 --> 18:36.633
and that's why I have
a scar going all the way up.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.300
He cut on the outside
of your neck?

18:39.333 --> 18:42.433
This was the wrong procedure,
the wrong approach,

18:42.467 --> 18:45.300
the wrong everything
to do to Michelle.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.266
You don't put scars on
the outside of the face.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.633
That's not the worst part.

18:48.667 --> 18:49.633
Uh-oh.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.300
On my last post-op,

18:51.333 --> 18:53.000
my appointment was really early
in the morning,

18:53.033 --> 18:55.400
and I was waiting
in the parking lot in the back,

18:55.433 --> 18:59.500
and there's this minivan
that pulls up right next to me.

18:59.533 --> 19:02.367
This guy opens the door,
falls out,

19:02.400 --> 19:05.700
and crawls over and starts
pulling on my handle,

19:05.734 --> 19:08.700
and I noticed
that it's my doctor.

19:08.734 --> 19:11.500
Wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

19:11.533 --> 19:14.500
Your doctor's a drug addict.

19:14.533 --> 19:16.400
I rolled the window down

19:16.433 --> 19:18.667
and was like,
"Um, do you need something?"

19:18.700 --> 19:20.633
He's all, "Let me in."
And I was like--

19:20.667 --> 19:22.633
"Let me in"?
And I said, "Uh..."

19:22.667 --> 19:25.266
And then he's like,
"Just come inside.
Just come inside."

19:25.300 --> 19:28.633
He doesn't have shoes on,
his hair is a mess, and--

19:28.667 --> 19:31.100
Pulled an all-nighter.
We get in the facility,

19:31.133 --> 19:36.033
and he's like, "Help me," uh,
get one of his white jackets.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.467
There's no one in his office
to help him?

19:37.500 --> 19:39.000
There's the two of you alone?

19:39.033 --> 19:41.533
Just the two of us but then
a staff started coming in.

19:41.567 --> 19:43.266
He says,
"Never speak a word of this."

19:43.300 --> 19:44.400
And I said, "Okay."

19:44.433 --> 19:45.533
Oh, boy.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.100
The doctor-patient relationship

19:47.133 --> 19:49.400
is one of the
most sacred relationships

19:49.433 --> 19:51.367
in any profession.

19:51.400 --> 19:56.500
And when a doctor tells you,
"Don't tell this to anybody,"

19:56.533 --> 19:58.400
you understand, because of
the basic power structure

19:58.433 --> 20:00.300
between the doctor
and the patient,

20:00.333 --> 20:03.667
why Michelle didn't run out
the door screaming.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.567
And what do you do?
[Michelle] I own a hair salon.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.767
And I'm the face of Michelada.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.467
[Dr. Dubrow]
That's your salon?
Yeah.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.066
And do people make comments
about the marks on your face?

20:14.100 --> 20:16.433
Most people don't ask

20:16.467 --> 20:20.567
because I'm like a--

20:20.600 --> 20:23.700
I'm just, like, always happy,
bubbly person.

20:23.734 --> 20:26.100
I think we talked about it right
after it happened.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.734
And then I saw her reaction,

20:27.767 --> 20:30.533
and then it's just like,
I don't wanna hurt her feelings.

20:30.567 --> 20:34.433
And you thought that was it,
this is the way she's gonna live
the rest of her life.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.033
[Dr. Nassif]
I think our next step
is to go in the exam room.

20:37.066 --> 20:40.700
We'll be able to assess
what can we do to improve
that area.

20:40.734 --> 20:41.700
Okay.
Okay?

20:41.734 --> 20:43.066
So let's go.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.033
Today was the first day
that I realized

20:45.066 --> 20:48.100
that this doctor had
done something so wrong.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.033
He really took a lot from me.

20:50.066 --> 20:51.467
He took a lot.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
Let's feel this implant here.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.133
Yeah, I don't like that chin
implant.

20:58.166 --> 20:59.400
That's gotta go.

20:59.433 --> 21:00.500
Yes.

21:00.533 --> 21:01.633
So taking out the chin implant

21:01.667 --> 21:02.767
through one of these incisions

21:03.000 --> 21:04.066
is gonna help.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.400
However,
you have some loose skin.

21:06.433 --> 21:11.166
And I think, to give your face
a little softer contour

21:11.200 --> 21:13.100
that we're thinking
about doing a lift.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.433
By doing that,

21:14.467 --> 21:16.066
that will also help soften

21:16.100 --> 21:17.500
some of the areas

21:17.533 --> 21:20.133
that you've had
liposuction done.

21:20.166 --> 21:21.400
So would you like to do this?

21:21.433 --> 21:24.567
Yes. Yes.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

21:26.633 --> 21:29.734
I'm so overwhelmed
with excitement right now.

21:29.767 --> 21:31.166
He's gonna do a facelift,

21:31.200 --> 21:34.166
and it just means a lot to me

21:34.200 --> 21:36.066
to be able to have this done

21:36.100 --> 21:38.166
finally after so many years.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.567
Thank you guys.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.734
Thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, too.

21:43.433 --> 21:46.767
See what happens when we take
this implant out.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.667
No way.

21:48.700 --> 21:53.500
Because you have such large
implants put in a small chest
wall,

21:53.533 --> 21:55.066
some people call
this a uniboob.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.033
This is a very difficult
problem.

22:00.734 --> 22:03.266
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

22:03.300 --> 22:07.100
Next patient has
very large breast implants.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.066
Here's Lindsey with...

22:09.100 --> 22:11.100
Her daughter.
Very big breasts.

22:11.133 --> 22:13.200
Very big breasts,
very small body.

22:13.233 --> 22:17.200
You have very big implants
like this and a small girl,

22:17.233 --> 22:20.734
it's hard to reinforce
the pocket so that this
doesn't happen.

22:20.767 --> 22:22.533
Can you please send in Lindsey?

22:24.033 --> 22:25.633
Hello.
Lindsey.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.233
Nice to meet you.
Terry Dubrow.
How are you?

22:27.266 --> 22:28.300
Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.633
Lonita.
Lonita?

22:29.667 --> 22:30.633
Nice to meet you.
Mom?

22:30.667 --> 22:32.133
Lindsey's mother.

22:32.166 --> 22:33.567
We saw a picture of you
and a young girl.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.233
Is that your daughter?
Yes.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.567
Yes, Anaya.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.100
How old is she?
She will be six.

22:38.133 --> 22:40.100
How old are you?
But you look about 16.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.300
I had her at 16.

22:41.333 --> 22:42.734
You did?
Yes.

22:42.767 --> 22:45.133
I was actually
on 16 And Pregnant.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.233
What's that?
You know what show?

22:47.266 --> 22:48.500
16 And Pregnant?

22:48.533 --> 22:50.100
No.

22:50.133 --> 22:51.333
Paul doesn't know
about 16 And Pregnant

22:51.367 --> 22:54.133
because he's 60
and out of touch.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.133
We've seen your pictures.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.533
You obviously have had
a breast augmentation.

22:58.567 --> 23:01.266
So I met a plastic surgeon.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.533
He knew that I was
on 16 And Pregnant.

23:04.567 --> 23:08.633
And if I allowed my surgery
to be live streamed,

23:08.667 --> 23:10.533
then he would do it for free,

23:10.567 --> 23:12.767
so I said, "Wow,"
like I'm hitting
the lotto with this deal."

23:13.000 --> 23:15.166
I didn't think I was even
any sort of famous.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.667
But you were on a TV show.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.767
When you'd walk into a store
or the airport,

23:19.000 --> 23:20.133
would people know who you are?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.667
They did, yeah.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.367
That's the definition of fame.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.000
But I thought that was,
like, six years ago.

23:25.033 --> 23:26.000
I was like, "Oh, whatever."

23:26.033 --> 23:28.000
And it went literally worldwide.

23:28.033 --> 23:33.333
When I woke up and I saw
how worldwide my surgery
Snapchat story had gone,

23:33.367 --> 23:36.734
I was shocked
at how concerned people were

23:36.767 --> 23:38.633
with my life still.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.333
I admit I was a little naive.

23:40.367 --> 23:41.367
So what are your goals?

23:41.400 --> 23:43.300
I want them to be smaller,

23:43.333 --> 23:45.367
not too much smaller,
but smaller.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.233
Okay, and we noticed
that when you're lying down,

23:47.266 --> 23:49.133
they seem to be going off
into your armpits a little bit.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.233
Yeah, like, they don't stay.

23:51.266 --> 23:53.734
Breast implants are designed
to fit

23:53.767 --> 23:56.734
in certain size chest walls.

23:56.767 --> 24:01.033
Lindsey's size
and breast dimensions
are much more appropriate

24:01.066 --> 24:03.700
for an implant that's
about a third of the size.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.633
What does your husband think?

24:05.667 --> 24:08.734
Well, he loves them,

24:08.767 --> 24:10.400
but he just wants me happy,

24:10.433 --> 24:14.100
so if that's what we have to do,
then he's fine.

24:14.133 --> 24:15.667
What to do depends on

24:15.700 --> 24:18.300
exactly what your
skin elasticity's like.

24:18.333 --> 24:21.133
I think we can figure that out
more accurately

24:21.166 --> 24:24.100
by looking at you and examining
you. Is that okay?

24:24.133 --> 24:25.700
Okay. Very good.
Okay.

24:25.734 --> 24:27.333
Let's have a look
at what's going on.

24:27.367 --> 24:29.700
It's gonna be like, "Aah!"

24:29.734 --> 24:34.700
Okay, so because you're right
pocket is lower than your left,

24:34.734 --> 24:37.100
your right areola
has been displaced

24:37.133 --> 24:39.133
the proportional amount up.

24:39.166 --> 24:43.333
Okay, so the distance
between your notch is 22.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.400
And then your right is gonna be
less than that.

24:45.433 --> 24:46.667
It's 20.
20.

24:46.700 --> 24:47.734
Okay.
Wow.

24:47.767 --> 24:49.033
Oh, so it's two inches.

24:49.066 --> 24:50.033
So-- It's two centimeters.

24:50.066 --> 24:51.734
So it's less than an inch.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.600
[Lindsey]
Two centimeters--
that sounds like a lot,

24:54.633 --> 24:56.300
and it definitely shows.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.767
Because you have
such large implants

24:59.000 --> 25:01.100
put in a small chest wall,

25:01.133 --> 25:02.667
some people call this a uniboob.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.333
You ever hear this expression--
symmastia?
Yeah.

25:05.367 --> 25:07.400
The implants are way too large,

25:07.433 --> 25:10.433
so she needs complete
pocket rearrangement.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.233
This is a very difficult
problem.

25:13.266 --> 25:17.033
When it comes to breasts,
there's the pocket,
there's the implant.

25:17.066 --> 25:19.166
and then there's the
overlying soft tissue.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.066
So your pocket is way to big.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.433
The way we close that down
is we put stitches in,

25:23.467 --> 25:27.033
but it hast to be
a very stable pocket

25:27.066 --> 25:31.166
that doesn't allow an implant
to break it down,

25:31.200 --> 25:32.367
and that's what's happened
with you.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.433
The implant's so heavy,

25:34.467 --> 25:37.767
it's caused
a weighted dissection.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.266
You have to put a smaller
implant significant enough

25:41.300 --> 25:43.133
that you maximize the chance

25:43.166 --> 25:45.500
the repair will hold and work.
Hold. Exactly.

25:45.533 --> 25:48.333
I wanted to get large breasts.

25:48.367 --> 25:50.100
That's what I asked for,

25:50.133 --> 25:51.367
but I didn't realize

25:51.400 --> 25:53.233
that the size would cause

25:53.266 --> 25:54.734
this many complications.

25:54.767 --> 25:56.133
This is fixable.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.400
There are challenges to it.

25:57.433 --> 25:59.166
There are sometimes
touchups needed,

25:59.200 --> 26:01.166
but this is something
we've done many times.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.367
Is that something
that you wanna do?

26:03.400 --> 26:05.433
Yes, definitely.
All right.

26:05.467 --> 26:08.233
I'm so excited Dr. Dubrow
can do my surgery.

26:08.266 --> 26:11.266
I'm just thinking, "What day?
When can we get it done?"

26:11.300 --> 26:13.266
It's very nice meeting you.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.667
Pleasure meeting you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.233
Nice to meet you.

26:20.333 --> 26:24.400
Hi, I'm here for my appointment
with Dr. Dubrow. I'm Shannon.

26:24.433 --> 26:28.300
I'm so excited that this
is all coming to an end finally.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.300
Getting them fixed, dating life
is going to open up.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.767
I think that I'll have
much more peace of mind

26:34.000 --> 26:36.467
and have matching boobs

26:36.500 --> 26:38.767
for the first time in my life.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.200
I know you wanna be bigger.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.166
Every young, pretty girl wants
to be bigger,

26:42.200 --> 26:43.533
but you're gonna get
what you get

26:43.567 --> 26:45.467
dictated not by me

26:45.500 --> 26:47.400
but by your breast tissue. Okay?

26:47.433 --> 26:49.500
Oops. Oh!
Ooh, too soon.

26:49.533 --> 26:52.467
Never mind. Surgery's cancelled.
[groans]

26:52.500 --> 26:57.367
Shannon's breasts had so much
devascularization done,

26:57.400 --> 26:59.500
so there exists
a great possibility

26:59.533 --> 27:02.166
that any manipulation I do
in those areas

27:02.200 --> 27:04.333
can result
in further loss of tissue

27:04.367 --> 27:07.266
and could turn into actually
a complete disaster.

27:12.367 --> 27:14.533
My plan today is to start
by making incisions

27:14.567 --> 27:16.467
in the bottom of
Shannon's areolas.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.233
I will then remove
the scar tissue

27:18.266 --> 27:20.300
that's causing her
contour irregularities

27:20.333 --> 27:23.567
and make small cuts to release
the pectoralis major muscle.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.533
Next I will use the scar tissue

27:25.567 --> 27:28.367
to raise inframammary crease
on the left side

27:28.400 --> 27:30.467
and improve
the breast symmetry.

27:30.500 --> 27:33.233
I will then replace
her old implants with silicone

27:33.266 --> 27:35.567
and perform
a circumareolar mastopexy

27:35.600 --> 27:38.333
by removing breast tissue
around the areola

27:38.367 --> 27:40.066
in order to deproject

27:40.100 --> 27:42.000
the tubular appearance of
the nipples,

27:42.033 --> 27:44.500
giving Shannon
a normal breast shape.

27:44.533 --> 27:48.333
Nothing like a little high-risk
case in the afternoon. Right?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.533
Along with all
of her other issues,

27:50.567 --> 27:53.500
Shannon has scar tissue now
that's formed,

27:53.533 --> 27:55.100
so I'm removing the front part

27:55.133 --> 27:57.300
of the scar-tissue shell

27:57.333 --> 28:01.333
that's encasing the implant.

28:01.367 --> 28:04.467
This is the front part
of the capsule

28:04.500 --> 28:06.400
that was on top of the implant.

28:06.433 --> 28:10.767
What I'm doing is removing
the anterior or front portion

28:11.000 --> 28:13.367
of the scar tissue capsule.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.567
Hopefully this will give
a very smooth contour

28:16.600 --> 28:19.567
and a nice round appearance
externally.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.367
Okay, so I'm just gonna make
a little incision in this.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.533
Let's see if this scar goes
full--

28:25.567 --> 28:27.233
Oh, look at that.

28:27.266 --> 28:29.266
Whoa, hello. Eesh.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.100
That's dead f-- look at that.
That's dead fat.

28:31.133 --> 28:32.567
That's gross.
Oh, my goodness.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
Look at that. Look at that.
That's dead fat.

28:34.633 --> 28:39.166
The doctor-- look at that.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.467
[sucking]
Yech.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.400
So that's the dead fat.

28:42.433 --> 28:44.333
In Shannon's breast tissue,

28:44.367 --> 28:48.600
I found exactly where some of
the fat was injected that died,

28:48.633 --> 28:51.533
that has created cysts
within the breast tissue

28:51.567 --> 28:55.033
that are hard and you can suck
out and remove.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.367
I think we're good.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.400
Okay, let's see what she's got.

28:58.433 --> 29:01.166
Now that I've done the
dissection of the right breast,

29:01.200 --> 29:03.400
it actually looks
better than expected.

29:03.433 --> 29:05.400
But I've just made my task

29:05.433 --> 29:08.200
that much more difficult
to obtain

29:08.233 --> 29:10.433
because it's all about symmetry,

29:10.467 --> 29:12.233
and if you have a good breast
on the right,

29:12.266 --> 29:14.367
and a really bad one
on the left,

29:14.400 --> 29:17.100
I've made my problem
more complex.

29:17.133 --> 29:18.533
Put a couple implants in.

29:18.567 --> 29:20.433
This is gonna look like
[bleep]

29:20.467 --> 29:23.133
first time we set--
we put it in, I can tell.

29:23.166 --> 29:25.467
This is actually 60 ccs
bigger than what she had.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.433
See what that looks like.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.467
All right, let's sit her up.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.600
I'm afraid to look.

29:31.633 --> 29:35.300
No way.
Seriously?

29:35.333 --> 29:36.433
Seriously?

29:36.467 --> 29:38.400
This looks too good.

29:38.433 --> 29:43.166
It's very surprising that going
larger in Shannon's case

29:43.200 --> 29:46.467
actually fills out
her breast pocket more,

29:46.500 --> 29:50.333
allowing both a better
rounded contour

29:50.367 --> 29:54.500
and allowing her to achieve
the ultimate size goals
that she wants.

29:54.533 --> 29:57.133
Let's close
and detelescope the areolas.

29:57.166 --> 30:01.100
In order to detelescope
the nipples backwards,

30:01.133 --> 30:03.367
you do a donut mastopexy,

30:03.400 --> 30:06.266
where you make an incision
on the inside of the areola,

30:06.300 --> 30:09.600
and then an incision
on the outside of the areola,

30:09.633 --> 30:12.266
remove the intervening skin,

30:12.300 --> 30:15.100
and close the outer circle down
to the inner circle,

30:15.133 --> 30:18.633
reducing the projection
of the front of the breast.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.333
Okay, that's
what I'm talking about.

30:20.367 --> 30:21.700
Damn.

30:21.734 --> 30:23.500
That works.

30:23.533 --> 30:25.633

[Dr. Nassif]
We're entering the deep plane.

30:31.667 --> 30:34.633
There's a lot of fatty tissue
below the muscle.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.433
So I have to be very careful

30:36.467 --> 30:38.233
because the last thing
we wanna do

30:38.266 --> 30:40.533
is give a facial nerve injury
to Michelle.

30:40.567 --> 30:44.166

Oh, my goodness,
I am so nervous.

31:14.767 --> 31:18.333
I just can't imagine
what I'm gonna look like.

31:18.367 --> 31:19.734
Today is Michelle's surgery.

31:19.767 --> 31:21.734
Overall, her facial structure

31:21.767 --> 31:24.467
especially following
the facial liposuction,

31:24.500 --> 31:27.433
has caused her skin to pretty
much just fall

31:27.467 --> 31:30.567
and it's almost giving her
a square look to her face

31:30.600 --> 31:32.533
and not a heart-shaped look.

31:32.567 --> 31:33.734
Hopefully with what we do today,

31:33.767 --> 31:35.367
we're gonna get her down
that road.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.266
She has to be able to walk
in her salon

31:37.300 --> 31:39.033
and feel great about herself.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.467
I will start Michelle's surgery
by making an incision

31:46.500 --> 31:49.333
on the lower part of the chin
and remove her old implant.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.000
I will the inspect
the left side of her chin

31:51.033 --> 31:52.467
and debulk the fullness.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.033
On the right side of her chin,

31:54.066 --> 31:55.767
I may have to use fat grafting

31:56.000 --> 31:57.233
to smooth out the depression

31:57.266 --> 31:58.367
and soften her look.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.066
Finally I will do a facelift

32:00.100 --> 32:02.500
by making incisions
in front and behind the ears

32:02.533 --> 32:05.700
elevating the skin and
stitching up the muscles
in a vertical direction.

32:05.734 --> 32:07.633
This will help contour
her face,

32:07.667 --> 32:09.266
giving her the heart shaped
look

32:09.300 --> 32:10.734
she has desired for so long.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.767
Okay, let's start.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.633
We're gonna start,
go through the chin first.

32:19.667 --> 32:21.033
So here's the implant.

32:21.066 --> 32:23.300
So that was causing
some fullness.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.467
Chin implants are used
to basically give someone

32:25.500 --> 32:26.767
a stronger chin.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.700
That means give you
more volume from here.

32:28.734 --> 32:30.767
Also add a little fullness
from the front.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.066
But in Michelle's case,

32:33.100 --> 32:36.333
she's already full in what we
call the pre-jaw area right
here.

32:36.367 --> 32:38.367
That's the last thing she needs.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.667
Now we're gonna start
the facelift.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.767
Doing a facelift overall,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.367
you always have to make sure
you're in the right planes,

32:44.400 --> 32:47.066
that you're watching out
for all the nerves,

32:47.100 --> 32:49.667
because there's a lot of bad
things that could happen.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.300
So you have to have good
visualization

32:52.333 --> 32:53.500
and good techniques.

32:53.533 --> 32:56.333
Okay, we're gonna liposculpt

32:56.367 --> 32:58.767
the top of this mass.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.400
This is called open liposuction.

33:04.433 --> 33:06.767
Now that I've sculpted some of
the fat right below the skin,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.066
I can concentrate on lifting
and tightening

33:09.100 --> 33:11.000
Michelle's facial muscles.

33:11.033 --> 33:15.333
There's a lot of fatty tissue
below the muscles.

33:15.367 --> 33:17.667
So it's not like a nice, clear
plane.

33:17.700 --> 33:22.000
Normally this tissue comes
nicely right at you.

33:22.033 --> 33:23.433
It's not familiar.

33:23.467 --> 33:25.567
This is all
unfamiliar territory.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.567
So we have to be very, very
careful of what we're doing
right now.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.433
Michelle's anatomy is atypical.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.600
Normally I'm able to see
the nerves and the muscles,

33:33.633 --> 33:34.734
but in Michelle's case,

33:34.767 --> 33:36.000
there's a lot of fat here.

33:36.033 --> 33:37.600
So I have to be very careful

33:37.633 --> 33:39.300
when I'm stitching up
the muscles

33:39.333 --> 33:40.700
because the last thing
we wanna do

33:40.734 --> 33:43.500
is give a facial nerve injury
to Michelle.

33:43.533 --> 33:47.567
Okay, so we've lifted
under the deep plane

33:47.600 --> 33:50.367
in a more vertical fashion,

33:50.400 --> 33:53.300
and now we're stitching it
all together.

33:53.333 --> 33:57.767
And this is what's gonna give
Michelle that softer look.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.133
Michelle's been through
a journey of horror

34:00.166 --> 34:02.333
with what she has encountered
with her surgeries.

34:02.367 --> 34:06.066
Now we hope that she can put
all this behind her

34:06.100 --> 34:09.734
and, yes, move on
and just be happy.

34:09.767 --> 34:12.033
That is my goal.

34:12.066 --> 34:16.367
She looks so much better.

not 16 and pregnant.

you stop breastfeeding.

37:38.633 --> 37:40.734
how I got so damaged,

37:40.767 --> 37:43.433
and now I like to share
my experience

37:43.467 --> 37:45.433
and let people know.

37:45.467 --> 37:46.767
I feel like I look beautiful

37:47.000 --> 37:48.734
inside and out.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.767
I just can't wait for what
the future holds for me.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.700
[woman]
What do you think
she's gonna look like?

37:53.734 --> 37:55.333
[Guadalupe]
Beautiful.

37:55.367 --> 37:58.166
All the people that are here,
my aunts, my uncle,

37:58.200 --> 38:01.200
a lot of Michelle's clients,

38:01.233 --> 38:03.700
they're here to see
how her face turned out.

38:03.734 --> 38:06.367
[Michelle]
Hi, everybody.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.433
[cheering]

38:11.266 --> 38:13.333
I feel like this moment
should last forever.

38:13.367 --> 38:16.233
The amount of love
that I'm receiving right now

38:16.266 --> 38:19.266
feels so nice
and I just don't want it to end.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.333
A lot of you didn't know

38:21.367 --> 38:26.133
that I had a really bad surgery
done,

38:26.166 --> 38:29.700
and it was really hard,
being a hairstylist,

38:29.734 --> 38:33.033
working on all you
beautiful women,

38:33.066 --> 38:35.233
and I didn't feel
beautiful myself.

38:35.266 --> 38:39.000
so I decided to seek help

38:39.033 --> 38:42.667
and go to one of the best
doctors in the world,

38:42.700 --> 38:44.467
Dr. Nassif,

38:44.500 --> 38:47.066
who's also a cutie-pie.

38:50.033 --> 38:52.734
And he did an amazing job.

38:52.767 --> 38:56.133
I feel like Dr. Nassif
rode in on his white horse.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.433
He truly was my night
in shining armor.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.033
You look beautiful.

39:02.066 --> 39:04.233
A traumatic surgery
left me with a chin

39:04.266 --> 39:07.100
that looked masculine, lumpy,
and dented.

39:07.133 --> 39:08.467
I felt like a monster.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.467
Now, since my surgery,
I love my chin.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.500
It looks round, feminine,
beautiful,

39:14.533 --> 39:16.767
and I can finally be
the face of my salon.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.333
[Dr. Nassif]
How are you?

39:25.367 --> 39:27.000
[Dr. Dubrow]
How are you?
Nice. Good to see you.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.767
You are? Hi.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.667
Look at that smile
on her face.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.133
I feel really good.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.300
Really? After all that surgery?

39:34.333 --> 39:35.433
Yes.

39:35.467 --> 39:37.433
Huh.
It's crazy.

39:37.467 --> 39:40.200
In comparison to any of the
surgeries I've been through,

39:40.233 --> 39:41.700
it's basically painless.

39:41.734 --> 39:44.233
I went in there with my goal

39:44.266 --> 39:46.767
to sort of figure out

39:47.000 --> 39:49.433
what's going on
in the breast tissue,
how thick the breast tissue is,

39:49.467 --> 39:51.433
what the blood supply's like,
what the scar's like.

39:51.467 --> 39:53.333
I got them pretty symmetrical.

39:53.367 --> 39:55.500
And then the issue was,
what size?

39:55.533 --> 39:59.000
You had 260 cc implants.
Yes.

39:59.033 --> 40:00.500
320 looked better.

40:00.533 --> 40:01.767
I got what you wanted,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.200
I got what I wanted--

40:03.233 --> 40:05.300
nice shape, good symmetry,

40:05.333 --> 40:08.166
and a much bigger size.
All right?

40:08.200 --> 40:11.066
She's actually got some...
Well, she hasn't seen them yet,
though.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.467
I don't think I've seen
a boob victory dance before,

40:13.500 --> 40:15.467
but I hope she feels
the same way

40:15.500 --> 40:18.333
after we unwrap them
and see how they're doing.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.400
Remember, different amount of
work was done on each breast,

40:25.433 --> 40:29.133
so they're gonna have different
kinds of recoveries.

40:30.333 --> 40:33.400
Oh, stop it.

40:33.433 --> 40:36.166
Right?
That's so dope.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.200
[Dr. Nassif] That's so dope?
Listen to her.
[Dr. Dubrow] I know. It is dope.

40:38.233 --> 40:41.467
One personality
to the alternate personality.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.033
Unbelievable.
I'm so stoked

40:44.066 --> 40:46.100
about what I see in the mirror.

40:46.133 --> 40:48.467
This is like out of this world.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.467
The result's impeccable.

40:50.500 --> 40:53.333
But that transformation
is really remarkable.

40:53.367 --> 40:56.300
It's like psychiatry with
a scalpel almost, isn't it?

40:56.333 --> 40:57.500
Seriously.
Yeah.

40:57.533 --> 40:59.200
Shannon's personality's amazing,

40:59.233 --> 41:01.066
but we're only one day
out of surgery.

41:01.100 --> 41:04.066
There still could be
complications
that could result

41:04.100 --> 41:07.100
in a medical
and psychological disaster,

41:07.133 --> 41:09.500
and I don't want sad Shannon
back again.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.367
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.133
[Dr. Nassif] Nice seeing you.
[Colleen] Thank you so much.

41:20.266 --> 41:21.300
Since I was younger,

41:21.333 --> 41:22.500
I always was really small.

41:22.533 --> 41:24.300
Never really filled a bra.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.333
There's, like, nothing there,
basically.

41:26.367 --> 41:28.100
So being body conscious

41:28.133 --> 41:30.367
has been something
that I battled my entire life.

41:30.400 --> 41:34.066
Now having something
that I can look in the mirror
and be happy with,

41:34.100 --> 41:37.200
I just feel like
there's been so much stress
lifted off of me.

41:37.233 --> 41:41.133
I feel like they look like
what I would've wanted
from the very first surgery.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.500
They just look like
normal boobs.

41:42.533 --> 41:44.367
It's been over two years

41:44.400 --> 41:47.633
since I've been
in a bathing suit by a pool.

41:47.667 --> 41:50.033
This is definitely
the best I've felt

41:50.066 --> 41:52.166
about my appearance
in my entire life.

41:58.300 --> 42:00.433
She's gonna be coming in,
like, "Hey..."

42:00.467 --> 42:02.500
[mutters, laughing]

42:02.533 --> 42:03.600
I can guarantee that.

42:03.633 --> 42:05.600
Oh, there she is!

42:07.600 --> 42:10.367
It's cool to know
that my confidence level

42:10.400 --> 42:11.600
is now to a point

42:11.633 --> 42:14.567
where I'm excited
about people seeing me.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.300
It's just so awesome

42:16.333 --> 42:18.133
'cause the last two years

42:18.166 --> 42:19.533
have been gnarly.

42:19.567 --> 42:21.100
It's just such a happy ending.

42:21.133 --> 42:22.567
It's almost like a stamp
of like,

42:22.600 --> 42:24.567
"Okay, you're done.
Like you can move on now."

42:24.600 --> 42:27.066
Oh, I get the first hug.

42:27.100 --> 42:28.633
Oh, you look great.

42:28.667 --> 42:30.367
Shannon looks incredible.

42:30.400 --> 42:34.033
I see the twinkle in her eye
and the shimmy in her step.

42:34.066 --> 42:35.533
That's the Shannon
we've been missing.

42:35.567 --> 42:36.600
[woman]
They're featured.
They're out.

42:36.633 --> 42:38.266
The girls are out.
They look great.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.367
They're, like,
perfectly... perfect.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.400
[man]
They are.

42:42.433 --> 42:45.200
Before my surgery,
my breasts were cross-eyed.

42:45.233 --> 42:48.033
My breasts and nipples
were completely uneven.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.433
I was emotionally unavailable,

42:49.467 --> 42:51.433
and I even stopped dating.

42:51.467 --> 42:54.633
But now thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
my breast deformity is gone

42:54.667 --> 42:56.500
and my girls are symmetrical.

42:56.533 --> 43:00.433
I'm single and ready to mingle.

43:00.467 --> 43:03.133
It's good to see you smile,
see that twinkle.

43:05.300 --> 43:09.400
I was awake when the doctor
started cutting the dead skin.

43:09.433 --> 43:11.600
I kept asking him,
"I have MRSA."

43:11.633 --> 43:12.633
This is right up there

43:12.667 --> 43:14.567
as one of the craziest stories

43:14.600 --> 43:16.100
we've ever heard.

43:16.133 --> 43:17.500
I've had so much surgery

43:17.533 --> 43:20.133
that no Irish doctor will
actually work with me anymore.

43:20.166 --> 43:21.367
Hi.
How are you doing?

43:21.400 --> 43:23.133
Oh, I get a hug, huh?

43:23.166 --> 43:24.200
Almost knocked me over.
Hi, Ava.

43:24.233 --> 43:25.433
Is Dr. Nassif single?

43:25.467 --> 43:27.200
My nose was completely
shattered.

43:27.233 --> 43:30.567
That's the hardest problem
in plastic surgery.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.333
Oh, he's got some blood
going down.

43:32.367 --> 43:34.633
What's his blood pressure?
It's high.

43:34.667 --> 43:36.500
