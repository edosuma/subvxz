Episode 1: First Day

00:24.473 --> 00:25.623
<i>Hi. I'm Will,</i>

00:26.072 --> 00:28.556
<i>and here are some things
I hoped wouldn't happen in my life.</i>

00:28.676 --> 00:30.312
<i>My father would leave my mother.</i>

00:30.432 --> 00:31.432
I'm so sad.

00:32.034 --> 00:35.200
<i>I'd be taken out of private education
and forced to go to a normal school.</i>

00:35.360 --> 00:36.639
Well, this is nice...

00:36.800 --> 00:39.421
<i>Where the school nutter would then
take a bit of a dislike to me.</i>

00:39.601 --> 00:41.199
I'll rip your fucking throat out!

00:43.040 --> 00:44.043
<i>But they do say,</i>

00:44.163 --> 00:46.759
<i>"Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger", except polio.</i>

00:46.920 --> 00:48.805
<i>And it's not been all bad.</i>

00:49.160 --> 00:51.288
I'm gonna take you outside
and I want you to fuck me.

00:51.408 --> 00:54.789
<i>Really? This is the story of how
I make new friends like him.</i>

00:54.909 --> 00:57.320
Friend. Fucking friend!

00:57.480 --> 00:59.400
<i>And him... and him.</i>

01:01.522 --> 01:02.753
<i>Him not so much.</i>

01:02.873 --> 01:05.208
<i>and definitely her.
Just to confirm,</i>

01:05.328 --> 01:06.719
we are going to have sex?

01:07.632 --> 01:08.930
<i>But back to the present.</i>

01:09.050 --> 01:10.964
<i>To put you in the picture,
I have no friends,</i>

01:11.084 --> 01:13.319
<i>it's my first day
and I'm in the headmaster's office</i>

01:13.480 --> 01:15.514
<i>for a welcome chat
with the rest of the new kids,</i>

01:15.634 --> 01:18.322
<i>or, as the otherwise known
as "the freaks".</i>

01:19.600 --> 01:21.227
You could be friends with us.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.959
<i>Yep, everyone's going to think
I'm one of them,</i>

01:24.121 --> 01:26.186
<i>and in a well-meaning
but disastrous move,</i>

01:26.361 --> 01:28.919
<i>as a new kid I've got to wear
a massive green badge.</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:31.656
<i>I can discuss it with my Head of Sixth,
Mr Gilbert.</i>

01:31.776 --> 01:33.295
<i>He seemed like an intelligent man.</i>

01:33.415 --> 01:35.341
Mr Gilbert,
you seem an intelligent man...

01:35.461 --> 01:37.647
Oh, I seem intelligent.

01:37.767 --> 01:40.349
- How lovely of you to say
- No, I just meant...

01:40.469 --> 01:43.233
I've long since been insecure
about my capacity for learning,

01:43.353 --> 01:47.320
so it's nice to have it ratified by you,
a child.

01:47.546 --> 01:49.479
What I meant was,
do you think these badges

01:49.683 --> 01:52.217
that single us out as new kids,
are a good idea?

01:52.337 --> 01:54.566
Yes.
If you have any more views on it,

01:54.686 --> 01:57.072
I suggest you join
the school debating society.

01:57.192 --> 01:59.759
Obviously,
you'll have to start one first.

02:00.343 --> 02:02.454
<i>Oh, my mistake! He's a wanker.</i>

02:03.999 --> 02:07.249
<i>- Hello, John. I'm Susie.
- And so began my first day.</i>

02:11.105 --> 02:12.105
Is this 6B?

02:13.401 --> 02:14.519
Great. I'm Will.

02:17.718 --> 02:18.718
Cool.

02:19.369 --> 02:21.002
God, just had a meet with the head

02:21.122 --> 02:22.839
and his pet ape, Gilbert.

02:23.171 --> 02:24.861
- What's his problem?
- What?

02:24.981 --> 02:26.831
That Gilbert. What a tosser!

02:27.579 --> 02:30.404
I mean, "Ooh, I'm Mr Gilbert.

02:30.524 --> 02:33.713
I'm such a big, huge massive freak!

02:33.833 --> 02:37.383
"And I just love to suck
the headmaster's balls! And then..."

02:41.448 --> 02:42.698
Is he behind me?

02:45.481 --> 02:47.159
- Did you hear any of that?
- Oh, yes.

02:47.455 --> 02:48.905
Can we start again?

02:49.025 --> 02:50.894
As you can see
from his rather natty badge,

02:51.014 --> 02:52.991
this is your new classmate, Will.

02:53.111 --> 02:55.295
As you share
most of the same classes Cooper,

02:55.415 --> 02:57.560
- you'll be looking after him.
- Sir, that's not fair!

02:57.720 --> 03:00.132
Lesson number one of the Sixth Form,
"Life is not fair".

03:00.252 --> 03:03.040
Sir! Look at his blazer for starters!

03:03.640 --> 03:05.159
He's got an actual briefcase!

03:05.279 --> 03:08.200
His shoes are clumpy,
his hair's a bit gay...!

03:08.360 --> 03:09.621
And that badge?!

03:09.741 --> 03:11.011
I mean the badge alone.

03:11.131 --> 03:12.759
It's happening. Get used to it!

03:15.322 --> 03:16.359
One more thing.

03:16.521 --> 03:18.759
The first day of term drink
down The Black Horse

03:18.920 --> 03:22.280
this tradition is ridiculous
and illegal.

03:22.648 --> 03:24.879
Don't get excluded
before you've even started.

03:25.232 --> 03:27.087
- What's he talking about?
- Oh, nothing.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.287
Is everyone going for a drink?

03:30.084 --> 03:32.234
No. I have to go this way.

03:38.016 --> 03:40.648
- "Ooh, I'm Will"
- Yup, thanks very much.

03:40.768 --> 03:43.202
- Ooh, hello, Will
- Very nice, thank you.

03:43.322 --> 03:45.360
- Nice badge, dickhead.
- Lovely. Fantastic.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.390
- You must be what, Year Eight?
- I'm Will and I've got a spacker badge!

03:48.510 --> 03:50.691
"Spacker"?
Super. That's not even on the badge!

03:50.811 --> 03:53.319
- Briefcase wanker!
- Another baggage-themed insult.

03:53.439 --> 03:55.289
Thanks, Mum. Thanks a bunch.

03:58.701 --> 04:00.896
<i>Truth be told,
the first-day nerves had got to me,</i>

04:01.016 --> 04:02.566
<i>so I went for what turned out to be</i>

04:02.686 --> 04:05.137
<i>one of the more eventful shits
of my life.</i>

04:05.257 --> 04:07.439
I'm just good at shagging now...
That's all I'm saying.

04:07.655 --> 04:09.359
Bollocks! How do you do it best?

04:09.704 --> 04:10.704
Just deep.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.840
Try to get really deep,
right up to the balls.

04:13.016 --> 04:15.146
- And do you put the balls in?
- What?!

04:15.320 --> 04:18.701
I've heard you've got to put the balls
in to make it work.

04:18.821 --> 04:19.904
Yeah, can do.

04:20.024 --> 04:22.075
Some girls like it, some don't.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.199
- What?! Stop talking bullshit!
- Who are these girls you've fucked?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.557
While you've spent
the summer stalking Carli,

04:27.677 --> 04:29.561
I've been out porking loads of vag.

04:29.681 --> 04:32.062
One, I've not been stalking Carli,
she's just a friend.

04:32.182 --> 04:34.466
And two, you've never fucked anyone!

04:34.586 --> 04:37.321
- Nor have I, nor has Neil.
- Shut up, you dickhead!

04:37.441 --> 04:38.879
I've fucked loads of gir...

04:50.354 --> 04:51.846
What's the fuck are you doing?

04:51.966 --> 04:53.797
You trying to look at my cock?

04:53.917 --> 04:54.917
Good one.

04:55.163 --> 04:56.163
Fuck off!

04:58.924 --> 05:02.002
<i>I was beginning to wonder
what sort of place I'd come to,</i>

05:02.122 --> 05:03.660
<i>and then I found out.</i>

05:12.204 --> 05:13.438
Look at that.

05:13.558 --> 05:14.787
Beautiful!

05:15.841 --> 05:16.991
Come on, guys!

05:22.245 --> 05:24.595
Hello! I'm Will and I'm doing a shit.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.640
You're gonna die here, Will.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.554
That briefcase makes me wanna punch you.

05:31.674 --> 05:33.688
- Of course it does.
- What a spastic badge!

05:33.808 --> 05:36.171
- That's been pointed out already.
- Your shoes are well shit.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.089
- The shoes...
- Simon?

05:38.209 --> 05:39.840
- All right?
- How's it going?

05:39.960 --> 05:42.186
Since about five minutes ago? Fine.

05:42.306 --> 05:43.064
Great.

05:43.184 --> 05:45.811
I'm trying to find the common room.
Can you show me where it is?

05:45.931 --> 05:48.194
- Not really.
- Posh twat.

05:50.673 --> 05:53.846
Look. It's this way, but to me a favour
and just hang back a bit, yeah?

05:53.966 --> 05:54.989
Oh, sure!

06:03.432 --> 06:04.454
Wanker!

06:08.353 --> 06:10.419
<i>I still hadn't managed
to shake the freaks.</i>

06:10.539 --> 06:12.041
<i>It's not like I was aiming high,</i>

06:12.161 --> 06:15.519
<i>I just wanted to be friends with someone
who didn't have a badge on.</i>

06:15.930 --> 06:18.451
- Might not go to this thing tonight.
- I'm pretty knackered.

06:18.571 --> 06:20.205
We've just had ten weeks off!

06:20.401 --> 06:22.956
He's just spent the last ten weeks
wanking three times a day!

06:23.076 --> 06:24.519
That's why he's knackered.

06:24.849 --> 06:28.800
Yeah, that's it. I've had 210 wanks
and my cock's like a Peperami.

06:28.961 --> 06:31.304
- Whose cock's like what?
- Carli!

06:31.840 --> 06:34.040
It's just, um, nothing.

06:34.419 --> 06:36.734
Are you coming to the pub tonight then?
I'll be there.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.591
Great... That's great...

06:39.398 --> 06:40.948
Are you going, Simon?

06:41.200 --> 06:43.327
Not sure. I'm sort of more into clubs
than pubs.

06:43.447 --> 06:47.079
Gay clubs! He's just shitting himself
that he won't get served.

06:47.660 --> 06:50.039
- No, it's not that.
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

06:50.662 --> 06:52.147
Can you do me a favour though?

06:52.267 --> 06:53.319
Sure. Anything.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.999
You know what my mum's like.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.897
She'll freak if she hears
I've been near a pub, so

06:58.017 --> 06:59.719
don't mention it to your folks, yeah?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.670
- Sure.
- Thanks, hon!

07:03.274 --> 07:06.119
- Do you wear aftershave now?
- It's just Lynx.

07:09.682 --> 07:11.799
It's nice. You coming to Sociology?

07:13.359 --> 07:14.479
No. I'm good here.

07:14.641 --> 07:16.839
OK. I'll see you later then.

07:20.593 --> 07:22.756
Are you mental?! She's so fit!

07:22.876 --> 07:24.845
Why don't you just walk
to class with her?

07:24.965 --> 07:27.181
- I just don't feel like it.
- Oh, what's wrong?

07:27.301 --> 07:30.595
Did you get a hard on cos
the pretty girl spoke to you?

07:31.173 --> 07:33.880
Hang on, you haven't actually got
a stalk on, have you?

07:35.090 --> 07:37.240
- Oh, my God, he's got a boner!
- Jay, please...!

07:38.244 --> 07:39.748
Simon's got a boner!

07:40.025 --> 07:40.987
Boner!

07:42.070 --> 07:43.884
- Let's have a look!
- Don't be shy.

07:44.004 --> 07:45.959
Let's have a look.
Show us! Show us your boner!

07:46.079 --> 07:47.535
<i>So I was left with a choice:</i>

07:47.655 --> 07:51.199
<i>stick with the freaks or make friends
with the boy now called "Boner".</i>

07:51.360 --> 07:54.759
- Are you coming to Sociology, Simon?
- Boner! Boner! Boner!

07:55.039 --> 07:57.172
- Oh. I'll save you a seat.
- Thanks.

07:57.361 --> 08:00.642
<i>Well, there you go.
I suppose beggars can't be choosers.</i>

08:09.604 --> 08:12.039
<i>And so my quest to make friends went,
not worse,</i>

08:12.159 --> 08:13.691
<i>but certainly not better.</i>

08:13.811 --> 08:15.996
<i>It was as if I had some kind
of contagious disease</i>

08:16.116 --> 08:18.849
<i>and to be seen with me
was a form of social death,</i>

08:18.969 --> 08:21.809
<i>which it is, but I was amazed
they worked it out so quickly.</i>

08:21.929 --> 08:24.206
<i>It wouldn't stop me.
Anyone can be your friend.</i>

08:24.326 --> 08:27.176
<i>You just need to hang around them
long enough.</i>

08:29.131 --> 08:31.867
Don't look left, Simon. There's a girl
with a knee-length skirt on.

08:31.987 --> 08:34.567
- You might spunk in your pants.
- Yeah, very good.

08:34.687 --> 08:37.070
- Hi, Simon.
- All right? This is Will.

08:37.190 --> 08:39.048
- Nice to meet you.
- Ooh, briefcase.

08:39.168 --> 08:41.277
- Yeah, briefcase!
- Yes, it's a briefcase.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.159
Ooh, briefcase!

08:43.320 --> 08:45.760
- Right. These are your friends?!
- Where we meeting tonight?

08:45.920 --> 08:48.065
The Black Bull.
It's just out on the London Road.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.296
- Oh, is this the drink thing?
- Great. What time?

08:50.416 --> 08:52.642
Whatever time you like.
You're going on your own.

08:52.762 --> 08:55.119
- I just thought we could...
- No, you thought wrong.

08:55.281 --> 08:57.933
Shit! What if we don't get served?
Carli will think I'm a loser.

08:58.053 --> 08:59.923
- She'd be right.
- She might not get served.

09:00.043 --> 09:02.761
Girls always get served. As soon as
they get tits, they get served.

09:02.881 --> 09:05.256
And fit girls like her
definitely always get served.

09:05.376 --> 09:07.366
- I'm gonna get served.
- How do you know?

09:07.486 --> 09:10.713
I've got a fake ID, innit. A driving
licence that says I'm 18 years old.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.183
But you're not 18.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.370
That's right, Neil. It's fake ID.

09:14.490 --> 09:17.122
- Oh, no...
- Is that your mum?!

09:17.242 --> 09:18.799
I told her not to pick me up.

09:19.745 --> 09:21.995
- She's fit!
- Yeah, I'd fuck her!

09:22.799 --> 09:25.159
- Thanks very much
- No, I would though. Wouldn't you?

09:25.320 --> 09:28.689
- Well, if she's my mum... No?
- But if she wasn't?

09:28.809 --> 09:30.569
- She is though{, so}...
- What he's saying is,

09:30.689 --> 09:32.480
if she wasn't your mum,
would you fuck her?

09:32.600 --> 09:34.843
- Are we still doing this?
- So you would fuck her?

09:34.963 --> 09:37.668
I wanna know, if you'd get down
between her legs, spread them...

09:37.788 --> 09:39.879
Can we stop talking
about my mother's vagina!

09:41.641 --> 09:43.808
- Maybe see you tonight?
- You're not invited.

09:43.928 --> 09:45.678
Unless you bring your mum.

09:49.481 --> 09:51.064
Did you have to pick me up?

09:51.184 --> 09:54.426
I just wanted to hear about
your first day. I like your badge!

09:54.546 --> 09:56.560
Why did you say I got bullied
at my last school?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.231
- I thought you were.
- No{, I wasn't}.

09:58.351 --> 10:00.560
I got wedgied a couple of times,
but that was just a fad.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.000
They wanted a reason
and that's what sprang to mind.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.960
Instead of,
"I can't afford the school fees."

10:06.120 --> 10:08.240
- I'm going to the pub tonight...
- With who?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.889
- Just some friends...
- Friends! Already?

10:11.009 --> 10:12.659
Yes, "friends already".

10:12.931 --> 10:15.560
Make sure these so-called friends
aren't just making fun of you.

10:15.721 --> 10:18.239
- Why would they be doing that?
- I don't want you bullied again.

10:18.401 --> 10:19.765
I was not bullied!

10:22.480 --> 10:24.103
Can I borrow 20 quid?

10:25.400 --> 10:27.970
<i>For all the new Sixth Formers,
this would be a massive night.</i>

10:28.090 --> 10:31.126
<i>It wasn't the drink, it was
an opportunity to reinvent yourself.</i>

10:31.246 --> 10:32.639
<i>A chance for a new start.</i>

10:34.347 --> 10:36.090
And I've told you money's tight.

10:36.210 --> 10:38.959
D'you want me to be called
"pikey" by my mates? Do ya?

10:39.955 --> 10:43.242
- Jay, I've got your dinner.
- Don't come in! Don't come in!

10:43.362 --> 10:45.212
All right, I won't come in.

10:46.115 --> 10:47.599
Mum, can I borrow 20 quid?

10:47.760 --> 10:51.039
Here's £10. Just promise me you won't
spend it on the fruit machines.

10:51.227 --> 10:53.199
I can't do that, I'm afraid. Bye!

10:56.369 --> 10:58.608
<i>It turned out we couldn't reinvent
ourselves</i>

10:58.728 --> 11:00.262
<i>without our parents noticing.</i>

11:00.382 --> 11:02.719
- That's a lot of gel in your hair.
- What?

11:02.880 --> 11:04.519
Smells quite strongly, too.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.200
Why are you telling this to me now?

11:06.362 --> 11:09.325
I'm just mentioning it. I can see
you've got a lot in, that's all.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.079
I don't... I can't wash it now, can I?
I've not got time!

11:12.955 --> 11:15.905
God, I don't know
why you're like this sometimes!

11:22.560 --> 11:24.994
<i>- Can I borrow 20 quid?
- And by "borrow",</i>

11:25.114 --> 11:28.920
<i>we meant "spend and never give back".
Next stop, the pub.</i>

11:36.315 --> 11:37.982
<i>My plan to make friends was working.</i>

11:38.102 --> 11:40.103
<i>Little by little,
I was wearing them down.</i>

11:40.223 --> 11:41.474
- Hi, guys.
- Not him!

11:41.635 --> 11:43.501
- Oh, he's all right.
- Sorry, I'm late.

11:43.621 --> 11:46.155
- Fingering your mum?
- Let me think... Er, no.

11:46.435 --> 11:49.324
- No, I wasn't. So what's the plan?
- We don't need a plan. We go in there,

11:49.444 --> 11:51.994
buy some drinks and then
wait for the gash to form a queue.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.240
- Sorry, did he actually say "gash"?
- It'll be fine. Relax.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.194
There is nothing relaxing about this.

11:57.495 --> 11:58.714
If we don't get served,

11:58.894 --> 12:01.280
I'll be humiliated
in front of the girl I've lusted

12:01.400 --> 12:03.670
- after since she was eight.
- You fancy eight-year-olds?!

12:03.790 --> 12:04.804
No, Neil...

12:05.249 --> 12:07.394
Our families are friends,
we were both eight.

12:07.700 --> 12:11.114
- You still fancied an eight-year-old.
- Come on. I've got ID. We'll be fine.

12:11.457 --> 12:13.540
You coming in, new boy?
I do have a name.

12:13.660 --> 12:17.034
- Sorry. You coming, briefcase mong?
- Brilliant. After you.

12:30.587 --> 12:32.815
- Well, this is nice.
- Maybe we should come back later?

12:32.935 --> 12:35.385
Don't shit yourself. We're the hardcore.

12:35.744 --> 12:37.943
- What are you having?
- Pint of lager.

12:38.063 --> 12:39.926
- Pint.
- Doesn't a pint seem like a lot

12:40.046 --> 12:42.247
- when you think about it?
- You wouldn't drink pint after

12:42.367 --> 12:44.565
- pint of orange squash, would you?
- What d'you want?!

12:44.685 --> 12:46.836
Pint... of...

12:47.760 --> 12:49.510
- Guinness.
- Guinness?!

12:49.858 --> 12:51.508
Oh, brilliant! A fruity!

12:54.916 --> 12:55.916
Oi, bruv.

12:56.667 --> 12:57.714
Yes, "bruv"?

12:57.875 --> 13:00.794
- Three lagers and a Guinness.
- Got any ID?

13:04.279 --> 13:05.529
"Brett Clement".

13:06.735 --> 13:09.715
You know this is
an Australian driving licence?

13:09.876 --> 13:12.194
- So, you're Australian?
- That's right, mate.

13:12.438 --> 13:13.921
So when's your birthday?

13:14.041 --> 13:15.991
The 15th of bloody May, 1989.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.979
Is he speaking in an Australian accent?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.234
- Sounds like it.
- Right. What you want again?

13:21.395 --> 13:24.355
- Three jars of lager and a Guinness.
- Are the other drinks for your mates?

13:24.694 --> 13:26.760
You betcha... cobber.

13:27.276 --> 13:30.154
I'm not serving them
unless they've got ID as well.

13:32.481 --> 13:34.105
Where are our drinks?

13:34.586 --> 13:37.804
Did you want drinks, too? You'd better
go and fucking get them then.

13:37.924 --> 13:40.316
This is tragic.
One pint between four of us?!

13:40.436 --> 13:43.300
As Jay has clearly failed,
I will deal with this.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.215
<i>I've never been served in a pub before,</i>

13:45.335 --> 13:46.925
<i>but how hard could it be?</i>

13:47.045 --> 13:49.895
Good evening.
Could I have three pints, please?

13:50.696 --> 13:53.594
- Do you have any proof of age?
- You have my word.

13:53.797 --> 13:55.147
- Any ID?
- Look,

13:55.267 --> 13:57.382
my father's left my mother
and I've been forced

13:57.502 --> 14:00.594
to go to a comprehensive school.
I've attached myself to a...

14:01.005 --> 14:04.045
a fairly average group and I'm trying
to make a few new friends

14:04.165 --> 14:06.749
to make life bearable.
You're human, you'll understand that.

14:06.869 --> 14:09.216
Perhaps you can pull me
three non-alcoholic lagers

14:09.336 --> 14:10.966
and we won't tell anyone about it.

14:11.086 --> 14:12.992
I can't serve you at all
if you're underage.

14:13.112 --> 14:14.994
You've driven me to this.

14:15.451 --> 14:19.615
The law states 16-year-olds can legally
drink cider, perry or mead,

14:19.735 --> 14:21.474
in a pub, if they're eating a meal.

14:21.635 --> 14:24.794
So I'll have three pints of cider
and three carvery dinners, please.

14:24.956 --> 14:26.870
It states if they are bought by an adult

14:26.990 --> 14:30.034
and accompanied by an adult.
No adult, no alcohol, I'm afraid.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.495
This isn't over.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.514
Hello, sir. My name's William.

14:33.801 --> 14:36.978
I'll pay for your drinks all night
if you'll order three pints of cider

14:37.098 --> 14:39.849
and three carvery dinners and then
come and sit with my friends and me.

14:39.969 --> 14:43.915
You don't have to talk to us,
you merely need to stay sitting with us.

14:46.416 --> 14:47.666
Yeah, all right.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.951
Terry, I'll have three ciders,
three carveries

14:50.071 --> 14:52.407
and four double rum and cokes,
please, mate.

14:52.527 --> 14:53.754
As many as four?

15:00.538 --> 15:02.188
- Sorted.
- Who's that?

15:02.587 --> 15:04.269
- This is, what's your name?

15:04.389 --> 15:06.815
- Steve. He'll be joining us.
- Why?

15:07.115 --> 15:09.139
- All right, Steve?
- Where are our drinks?

15:09.259 --> 15:11.474
It's a long story that involves
Steve as well.

15:11.594 --> 15:13.582
- Before we get our cider...
- Cider?!

15:13.756 --> 15:16.395
Yes, cider.
We've got to go to the carvery.

15:16.702 --> 15:19.383
Have you gone mental?!
What's Carli gonna think?

15:19.503 --> 15:22.984
"Simon's pretty cool. He goes out
and has meat and gravy with his booze!"

15:23.104 --> 15:25.595
We're not going to get served
unless we each get a carvery.

15:25.755 --> 15:26.994
Nice work, briefcase.

15:28.064 --> 15:29.414
For Christ's sake!

15:30.421 --> 15:32.514
- You coming then, Neil?
- Get mine for me.

15:38.007 --> 15:39.029
All right?

15:44.034 --> 15:46.184
I just lost ten quid on a fruity.

15:47.388 --> 15:48.938
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

16:02.313 --> 16:03.847
Oh, shit, it's from Carli.

16:03.967 --> 16:07.117
Brilliant. She asking
if your fit mate Jay's coming?

16:07.365 --> 16:10.514
No, she's saying it's so packed
she can't see where we are.

16:12.626 --> 16:15.216
- Is she a retard?
- She's in the Black Horse.

16:15.336 --> 16:16.911
- Where are we?
- Black Bull.

16:17.031 --> 16:19.195
Right, so we're in the wrong pub.
Let's go.

16:19.355 --> 16:21.747
Let's not be hasty.
We've got three carveries on the way.

16:21.867 --> 16:24.288
How could you confuse
the Black Bull with the Black Horse?

16:24.408 --> 16:25.834
Come on, I was half right!

16:34.802 --> 16:36.537
- Boner!
- Boner!

16:36.657 --> 16:38.293
- Good start
- Boner!

16:38.669 --> 16:39.395
Boner!

16:39.797 --> 16:41.541
- I'm going to find Carli.
- Boner!

16:41.661 --> 16:43.075
- Whose round?
- New boy's.

16:43.195 --> 16:44.579
- Again?!
- Yep.

16:47.671 --> 16:48.548
Simon!

16:48.668 --> 16:49.668
Simon!

16:50.170 --> 16:52.620
Where have you been? Come and sit down.

16:55.783 --> 16:57.308
Don't be shy, squeeze up.

16:57.428 --> 16:58.428
Oh, really?

16:59.083 --> 17:01.370
Tom's just coming back with the drinks.

17:01.490 --> 17:02.490
Cool.

17:05.038 --> 17:06.387
- Boner!
- Boner!

17:10.095 --> 17:12.181
Tom, this is Simon
I was telling you about.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.532
You all right, mate?

17:13.653 --> 17:16.394
Bit pissed. Been to the Black Bull first
just to sharpen up.

17:16.759 --> 17:18.209
This is a new Simon.

17:18.556 --> 17:21.432
You cried when your dad poured whisky
over the Christmas pudding.

17:21.551 --> 17:24.483
At least I didn't make myself sick
in my plate when it had peas on it!

17:24.604 --> 17:26.034
Thanks for bringing that up.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.019
- Lee Sharp.
- Lee Sharp.

17:32.139 --> 17:33.974
- It's definitely Lee Sharp!
- Lee Sharp!

17:34.094 --> 17:35.110
Lee Sharp!

17:35.982 --> 17:37.546
Oh, Roy Keane...

17:39.185 --> 17:41.435
- Four pints, please.
- ID, please?

17:41.839 --> 17:44.674
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Can't serve you without ID.

17:45.138 --> 17:47.488
- Do you do food?
- Kitchen's closed.

17:47.746 --> 17:50.583
- I'll just take the four pints then.
- I'll just see your ID then.

17:50.703 --> 17:54.181
Look, I've spent all night
trying to buy one drink

17:54.301 --> 17:56.880
so I can take part
in this poxy school tradition,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.995
so I'd like four pints of lager, please!

18:01.779 --> 18:03.275
ID, please!

18:09.135 --> 18:10.994
- We should get going, Carl.
- Oh, yeah.

18:11.155 --> 18:13.475
- You're going already?
- We've been here for two hours.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.510
Sure.

18:14.795 --> 18:16.795
Do you want a lift back, Simon?
Tom's got a car.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.875
Of course, he has. Nah.

18:19.035 --> 18:21.118
Come on, Carls. See you, mate.

18:21.238 --> 18:23.888
- See you later, Simon. Bye.
- Bye. See ya.

18:24.843 --> 18:26.877
- Lee Sharp! Lee Sharp!
- Lee Sharp!

18:26.997 --> 18:29.774
- It's definitely Lee Sharp!
- Lee Sharp. Lee Sharp.

18:29.894 --> 18:31.044
Oh, Giggsy...

18:31.693 --> 18:35.515
- Four... pints... of lager!
- ID!

18:35.675 --> 18:36.580
Look!

18:37.354 --> 18:38.904
Just look around you.

18:39.304 --> 18:41.434
Everyone in this bloody pub is underage!

18:43.264 --> 18:44.753
He's underage!

18:45.067 --> 18:46.317
She's underage!

18:47.171 --> 18:49.001
He looks a bit older cos he's uglier,

18:49.121 --> 18:51.194
but he's in the year below even me!

18:51.922 --> 18:54.115
Look at that bumfluff! 16!

18:55.435 --> 18:57.675
That bra's got padding in it! 16.

18:58.955 --> 19:02.115
His mum still buys his trousers! 16!

19:02.705 --> 19:03.878
16!

19:03.998 --> 19:05.525
At a push, 17!

19:05.645 --> 19:06.721
16!

19:06.841 --> 19:08.691
And this one, Mark Donovan!

19:09.094 --> 19:11.465
He looks old and he's meant to be hard,

19:11.585 --> 19:13.875
but he's still only 16!

19:14.056 --> 19:15.679
All these people you've served,

19:15.799 --> 19:19.395
whatever bloody ID they've used,
are underage!

19:22.059 --> 19:24.209
Right, we're closed! Everyone out!

19:25.315 --> 19:26.965
You lot are all barred!

19:27.668 --> 19:28.668
Out!

19:37.030 --> 19:38.955
Nice to see you again, MacKenzie.

19:39.116 --> 19:41.234
And congratulations
on doing my job for me.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.069
I'll make sure you get
another badge for this!

19:44.189 --> 19:45.839
- Sir...
- Now get out.

19:46.035 --> 19:47.194
I want to have a pint.

19:48.547 --> 19:50.397
Pint of lager, please, Ian.

19:51.153 --> 19:54.034
I don't care how fit your mum is,
I wouldn't be seen dead with you!

19:54.305 --> 19:56.534
- You coming, Si?
- Nah.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.514
I said I'd look after supergrass here.

19:58.634 --> 20:00.619
I'd better not leave him on his own,
just in case.

20:00.739 --> 20:02.415
Why you staying with that bell end?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.701
- I am here!
- Yeah, I wish you weren't.

20:04.821 --> 20:06.271
See you later then.

20:08.669 --> 20:10.409
What a first day. I'm such a twat...

20:10.529 --> 20:12.959
Yes, you are.
That was pretty specialist back there.

20:13.079 --> 20:16.161
"His mum still buys his trousers"
was a personal highlight.

20:16.356 --> 20:18.331
Thanks. I made that up.

20:18.797 --> 20:20.256
Who was that guy with Carli?

20:20.376 --> 20:22.983
A friend, who didn't need ID.
And had a car.

20:23.541 --> 20:25.469
- I'm sorry, mate.
- Nah, it's OK.

20:25.589 --> 20:27.039
Please don't hit me.

20:27.891 --> 20:30.574
I'm not going to hit you here,
but I will get you.

20:30.694 --> 20:32.885
You won't know when it's coming,
but it is coming.

20:33.005 --> 20:35.055
At some point in the next year,

20:35.353 --> 20:36.603
I will get you.

20:39.809 --> 20:42.235
Is that your mum?! She is fit!

20:42.566 --> 20:44.874
- Thanks...
- Lovely to meet you, Mrs MacKenzie.

20:45.354 --> 20:47.595
I will see you later, Will, yeah?

20:47.770 --> 20:50.458
Nice to meet you. He seems nice.

20:50.675 --> 20:53.155
He's the school psycho
who just threatened to kill me.

20:53.315 --> 20:56.061
- I'm glad you're making friends.
- Do mums ever listen?

20:56.181 --> 20:57.967
<i>I'd had an eventful first day.</i>

20:58.156 --> 21:01.265
<i>My quest for friends had led to me
alienating the entire school,</i>

21:01.385 --> 21:03.194
<i>and the psychotic head of Sixth Form.</i>

21:04.218 --> 21:05.577
<i>The really good news is</i>

21:05.697 --> 21:07.914
<i>I'm now on the school nutter's
"To Stab" list,</i>

21:08.298 --> 21:10.348
<i>if he doesn't shag my mum first.</i>
