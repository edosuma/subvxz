yet still gets to Little League games
and to ballet recitals.

16:47.973 --> 16:51.204
What's that?
A day in the life of Peter DeCaro.

16:51.276 --> 16:55.235
It's his agenda.
Why don't you have a look,Jack?

16:55.314 --> 16:58.340
There may be something in here
that'll tell me what happened.

16:58.417 --> 17:02.751
<i>What happened with what?</i>
With DeCaro yesterday-
something that set him off, you know?

17:02.821 --> 17:06.257
Where did he go? Who did he see?
What did he eat for lunch?
Or who.

17:06.325 --> 17:11.023
What?
The coroner said that when they
put Mrs. DeCaro back together...

17:11.096 --> 17:13.087
they were missing her heart.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.196
<i>I'm sorry, that was tactless of me.</i>
<i>The woman's dead.</i>

17:17.269 --> 17:20.897
I guess I'm trying to cover up
being totally freaked out by it.

17:21.906 --> 17:26.241
<i>Uh, Ziggy says this heart business</i>
<i>never came up at Peter's trial.</i>
<i>[ Ziggy Beeping ]</i>

17:26.310 --> 17:29.508
And, uh, if the coroner made a report,

17:29.581 --> 17:31.845
it's not in the files, so-

17:34.653 --> 17:36.644
Here we go.
What?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.919
Yesterday morning he had
several financial meetings,

17:39.992 --> 17:42.153
lunch with some bigwig from Japan.

17:43.328 --> 17:47.788
He had a doctor's appointment after lunch,
and then he canceled the rest of the day.
Who's the doctor?

17:47.866 --> 17:51.302
Mason Crane.
Maybe he had
an incurable disease,

17:51.370 --> 17:53.565
<i>and he couldn't handle it.</i>
That's the shrink.

17:53.639 --> 17:57.370
DeCaro asked for Crane
even before he asked for his lawyer.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.902
I want to talk to him.
I already did.

18:00.979 --> 18:05.939
We questioned Crane, and he said that
DeCaro had been under some kind of stress-
some type of marital problem.

18:07.052 --> 18:10.419
Well, maybe then Crane knew DeCaro
wanted to kill his wife.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.253
- Oh.
- That would make it premeditated.

18:13.325 --> 18:16.692
Mason Crane is one of the most
respected psychiatrists in this city.
That doesn't make a difference!

18:16.762 --> 18:19.788
Sometimes these guys-They get too close.
They get involved and they lose track.

18:19.865 --> 18:23.494
Look, if he knew that a crime
was gonna be committed,
he was obligated-

18:23.569 --> 18:25.594
[ Sighs ]
I should have gotten there sooner.

18:25.671 --> 18:29.266
You got there damn near
before the call went out.
I got there late.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.832
No.

18:33.245 --> 18:37.113
But the kids didn't.
That's a good point, Sam.

18:37.182 --> 18:40.447
I spoke to the little girl.
She didn't see anything.

18:40.519 --> 18:43.647
Her brother blocked her view,
and then he pushed her
into the bathroom to hide.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.919
What about the boy?
His name is P.J.
I think he's still at the hospital.

18:46.992 --> 18:50.155
Um, I think they took him
to Malibu General.
I want to talk to him.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.459
I'll ask the doctors if
they'll let you speak to him.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.692
Right, and get any background
you can on Crane.
Okay.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.792
Does this mean that
dinner tonight is on or off?

18:57.870 --> 19:01.328
Dinner?
Dinner tonight- my place, 9:00.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.340
- Say yes.
- Why?

19:03.408 --> 19:07.139
<i>That way I won't have to go looking for you</i>
<i>when you're sneakin'around</i>
<i>the DeCaro house again tonight.</i>

19:07.212 --> 19:10.943
"Why?''
Not.

19:11.016 --> 19:14.110
Why not?
I'll take that as a positive response.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.552
Yeah.
I think.

<i>[ Sam ] Look, P.J., I know this is hard for you.</i>

19:45.517 --> 19:49.749
Now I know that
you're hurting too.

19:49.821 --> 19:52.915
But... I need you to come back.

19:54.993 --> 20:00.124
Not for a long time,
just for a couple seconds
so I can talk to you a little bit, okay?

20:02.668 --> 20:07.128
I know you're very frightened, and-
and you're very confused right now,

20:07.206 --> 20:11.643
but I need your help.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.271
Okay? So we can just talk,
just for a second, and-

20:20.953 --> 20:24.252
Okay. Okay.

20:24.323 --> 20:28.521

I'm gonna come back a little later.
Maybe we can try again. All right?

What can I do for you, Mr. Stone?
Uh, Peter DeCaro
suggested that I come see you.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.364
I'm sorry.
I'm not accepting any new patients.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.926

could make an exception.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.970
What is it you want, Mr. Stone?

21:23.048 --> 21:26.381
I want to sleep... again.

21:29.254 --> 21:32.121
I-I've been having these dreams.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.922
They're very frightening to me, and...

21:37.929 --> 21:39.920
I want 'em to stop.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.367
They have to stop, Dr. Crane.

21:45.437 --> 21:48.634
They have to.
Part of what you're saying
to me is a lie, Mr. Stone,

21:48.707 --> 21:50.698
and part of it is painfully true.

Be here tomorrow at 4:00.

21:53.278 --> 21:56.247
And please, Mr. Stone,

There's a Rolodex.
Why didn't we look in the Rolodex there?

23:05.717 --> 23:09.778
I mean, the guy's gotta be connected

Everything. Biggies!

23:15.427 --> 23:19.386
Wait a second.
What? What?

23:19.464 --> 23:21.830
Crane is seeing the husband,

23:21.900 --> 23:23.925
and Crane is seeing the wife.

23:24.002 --> 23:27.836
The wife too?
Plus half of L.A.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.069
What have we got
on this guy Crane?
Well, we don't have much.

23:31.143 --> 23:34.772
He practiced here in L.A. till '83,
then went to Chicago.

23:34.846 --> 23:37.838
He must have retired then,
because we don't have
anything else on him.

23:37.916 --> 23:42.546
What about Stone?
Well, he's adding up
to be a pretty regular joe.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.612

His mother died
when he was 1 0 years old.

23:49.394 --> 23:53.694
He dropped out of UCLA.
He was a pretty good athlete- the guy.

23:53.765 --> 23:58.464
Uh, then he joined the police force
and retired in 1 980.

23:58.537 --> 24:02.303
That pretty much brings him up
to where you leaped in.

he suspected marital problems?

Yeah, especially since
he's treating the two of'em.

If he's treating them both,
then he would know all their problems, right?
Maybe.

So why wouldn't he tellJanice
that her husband was homicidal?
Maybe he didn't know.
