WEBVTT

00:00.376 --> 00:01.491
So here's what you missed
on <i>Glee...</i>

00:01.502 --> 00:03.052
I needed you around,
and you weren't there.

00:03.070 --> 00:04.387
<i>Blaine cheated on Kurt</i>
<i>and they broke up,</i>

00:04.405 --> 00:06.239
<i>and Rachel and Finn</i>
<i>broke up, too, and Finn</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:08.491
<i>has no idea what he wants to
do with his life.</i> We're done.

00:08.525 --> 00:09.993
<i>Jake has his eye on Marley,</i>

00:10.027 --> 00:11.894
<i>which Kitty's</i>
<i>really not happy about,</i>

00:11.912 --> 00:13.162
<i>and Emma's not sure she wants</i>
<i>to leave McKinley</i>

00:13.197 --> 00:14.998
<i>to go to Washington with Will.</i>

00:15.032 --> 00:17.083
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee.

00:23.707 --> 00:25.741
Why do I always feel
so at home in a tire shop?

00:25.759 --> 00:28.011
That was a joke.
What do you want, Artie?

00:28.045 --> 00:29.245
I got a lot of work to do.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.413
I just wanted
to check in on you.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.547
You've had
a rough couple of months,

00:31.581 --> 00:32.747
and I thought maybe
you could use a friend.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.850
It's not that bad.

00:33.884 --> 00:35.418
I just embarrassed myself
out of the army,

00:35.436 --> 00:37.086
lost Rachel completely,

00:37.104 --> 00:39.588
and now I'm back in my hometown
working in a tire shop.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.257
Figure maybe my luck
will change soon

00:41.275 --> 00:42.358
and one of the lifts will break,

00:42.393 --> 00:43.592
and I'll get crushed by a car.

00:44.795 --> 00:47.530
I'm sorry, Artie.

00:47.564 --> 00:49.065
I appreciate what you're
doing; You're a great friend.

00:49.099 --> 00:50.400
I'm just kind of sitting
back and looking

00:50.434 --> 00:52.101
at the next 60
years of my life.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.602
It just sort of makes me
want to puke.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.288
But it is what it is.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.439
Do you remember what I said

00:56.457 --> 00:58.041
when I dedicated that song
to you last year?

00:58.075 --> 01:00.410
That you were
my friend, my hero.

01:00.444 --> 01:02.245
I'm not gonna let you bury
yourself in self-pity, Finn.

01:02.279 --> 01:03.630
You're better than that.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.548
You know, I've heard that
a lot all my life, Artie.

01:05.582 --> 01:07.550
That I'm better
than I think I am.

01:07.584 --> 01:09.452
Well, look around.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.920
Maybe I'm not.
You just lost

01:10.954 --> 01:12.788
your confidence
because you forgot your place.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.956
You're a creative person.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.892
You need to find
an artistic outlet.

01:15.926 --> 01:17.293
Come codirect the musical
with me.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.761
<i>Grease</i> was your idea.
I don't know

01:18.795 --> 01:20.263
how to direct a musical, Artie.

01:20.297 --> 01:21.814
Directing is
about having an idea

01:21.849 --> 01:23.466
and convincing everyone
around you to make it happen.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.567
I don't think so.

01:24.601 --> 01:25.985
Fine.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.970
Then I'm not doing it, either,

01:27.988 --> 01:29.489
which means there is no musical.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.774
You can't do that, man,
hold the musical hostage.

01:31.808 --> 01:33.142
That's like terrorism.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.678
Basically, Olivia Newton-John
is strapped to my chest,

01:35.713 --> 01:37.413
and unless you
codirect with me,

01:37.448 --> 01:38.498
I'm gonna blow her up.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.816
I'm serious, Finn.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.952
Trust me, as your friend,
you need to do this.

01:42.986 --> 01:44.337
Just so you can look
at the first month

01:44.371 --> 01:45.621
of the next 60 years
of your life

01:45.655 --> 01:46.622
and not want to puke.

01:46.656 --> 01:48.174
Auditions are tomorrow.

01:57.590 --> 01:59.419
(School bell ringing)

02:00.187 --> 02:03.839
Sam: As president and vice
president, we can pretty much decree

02:03.857 --> 02:05.708
which ever parts
we want, right?

02:05.743 --> 02:08.110
I'm not sure I'm gonna do
the musical this year.

02:08.145 --> 02:11.447
I'm not in the right headspace
to do a project like <i>Grease.</i>

02:11.482 --> 02:14.517
Since Kurt and I broke up,
I haven't slept,

02:14.535 --> 02:16.018
I lost my appetite.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.537
I don't even gel on week.

02:17.571 --> 02:18.621
This is pretty serious, then.

02:18.655 --> 02:22.291
Sam, Kurt was my soul mate.

02:22.326 --> 02:25.694
We talked about spending
the rest of our lives together.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.880
About retiring in Provincetown

02:27.915 --> 02:29.882
and buying a lighthouse
and starting an artists' colony.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.334
And now he won't even
return my calls.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.336
He won't text me.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.554
And that <i>gilmore girls</i> box set

02:34.588 --> 02:36.539
I sent him was returned
to me, unopened.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.808
He's gone.

02:38.842 --> 02:41.210
Maybe forever.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.229
Dude, I get it, except
for the lighthouse part.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.380
But look, everybody's
been there.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.681
You'll get through it.

02:47.951 --> 02:51.571

to you" begins)

Like what?

05:52.736 --> 05:53.536
I think I speak

05:53.570 --> 05:54.837
for both of us when I say

05:54.871 --> 05:57.173
that though you auditioned
with a Sandy song,

05:57.207 --> 05:59.875
you are the Danny
Zuko of our dreams.

05:59.909 --> 06:01.744
Right?
Yeah, yeah, totally.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.596
You were awesome.
Amazing.

06:03.630 --> 06:04.847
I can't.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.165
I'm sorry, I just can't, Finn.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.916
I didn't want to let you down,

06:07.935 --> 06:10.252
but <i>Grease</i> is a romance,

06:10.270 --> 06:15.191
and how can I play any of the
scenes if I have ruined mine?

06:15.225 --> 06:17.226
The truth of Danny Zuko.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.528
Thank you for letting me
audition, but I-I just can't.

06:19.563 --> 06:21.030
But wait.

06:21.064 --> 06:22.365
Is there any part you think

06:22.399 --> 06:23.532
you could play?

06:23.567 --> 06:25.117
I don't think so. Maybe...

06:25.152 --> 06:26.569
Maybe teen angel.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.571
It's only one scene,

06:28.605 --> 06:30.939
but probably not.

06:32.942 --> 06:36.128
Wow, I've never seen
Blaine so...

06:36.163 --> 06:38.381
<i>Masterpiece theater.</i>

06:38.415 --> 06:39.782
Look, sorry, man. I know
you're just trying to help,

06:39.800 --> 06:42.218
but this is a bad idea.

06:42.252 --> 06:44.053
(School bell ringing)

06:44.087 --> 06:45.921
Finn, hold up.

06:45.955 --> 06:47.390
What was a bad idea?

06:47.424 --> 06:48.891
Me directing.

06:48.925 --> 06:50.776
I'm not qualified
for any of this, Artie.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.428
You have to trust
your instincts.

06:52.462 --> 06:54.096
But also, part of
being a good director

06:54.130 --> 06:55.931
is surrounding yourself
with the right people.

06:55.965 --> 06:59.435
The right choreographer and
the right vocal Coach, right?

06:59.469 --> 07:01.237
It is. Just trust me.

07:01.271 --> 07:02.938
So I called in some favors,

07:02.972 --> 07:06.525
and the cavalry
has just arrived.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.991
(School bell ringing)

07:23.010 --> 07:25.478
School arts programs are
going the way of the dinosaur.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.930
Even the basics like choir
and band are disappearing.

07:27.964 --> 07:29.131
No one is disputing that.

07:29.165 --> 07:30.299
All I'm saying is

07:30.333 --> 07:31.600
if I go with Will
to Washington...

07:31.635 --> 07:33.602
Our relationship
will only grow.

07:33.637 --> 07:35.471
This is not just a
once-in-a-lifetime experience

07:35.505 --> 07:36.989
for me, but for both of us.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.674
And I feel that Emma
is dismissing it.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.026
And I feel
like Will just assumes

07:40.060 --> 07:41.210
I'm gonna happily
drop everything,

07:41.244 --> 07:42.695
play the part of the dutiful,

07:42.729 --> 07:44.146
1950s housewife,

07:44.180 --> 07:45.865
even though we're not even
married yet.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.149
She's made this analogy
several times.

07:47.183 --> 07:49.017
And that my job and my life

07:49.036 --> 07:50.519
and my dreams

07:50.537 --> 07:52.321
are somehow secondary
to that. I'm sorry,

07:52.355 --> 07:53.956
but am I wrong
for feeling that way?

07:53.990 --> 07:56.709
Pumpkins, bear Bryant once said,

07:56.743 --> 07:58.327
"feelings aren't right
or wrong.

07:58.361 --> 07:59.628
They just are."

07:59.663 --> 08:01.230
My relationship with Cooter,
it was more sour

08:01.264 --> 08:04.050
than Brian Urlacher's
compression shorts.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.735
That doesn't mean true blue

08:05.769 --> 08:07.169
sweeties like yourselves

08:07.203 --> 08:08.854
aren't gonna have
a flag on the play.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.639
Take a timeout. Call an audible.

08:10.674 --> 08:11.974
It's all about knowing

08:12.008 --> 08:13.809
when to pass and when to punt.

08:13.844 --> 08:16.529
That's very insightful, but...

08:16.563 --> 08:18.864
Shannon's right.
Time-out, time-out.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.150
Emma, I made a mistake when I
first talked to you about this.

08:21.184 --> 08:22.385
So let me just rewind

08:22.419 --> 08:24.320
and start from scratch.

08:24.354 --> 08:26.054
Oh, don't look like that, Emma.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.074
Emma, Emma, I love you

08:28.108 --> 08:29.992
with every fiber of my being.

08:30.026 --> 08:32.660
And no matter where we go
or what we do,

08:32.696 --> 08:35.264
I want us to always be together.

08:35.298 --> 08:36.999
This time, it's Washington.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.235
Next time, it can be
anywhere you want to go.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.486
So, I'm asking

08:40.520 --> 08:45.207
my partner, my equal partner...

08:45.241 --> 08:46.675
To join me.

08:46.710 --> 08:49.378
Would you consider it?

08:51.281 --> 08:54.416
I'll go.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.051
You-you sure?

08:56.085 --> 08:59.305
(Sighs)

09:00.974 --> 09:02.792
(School bell ringing)

09:02.826 --> 09:05.027
We have plenty of girls
auditioning for Sandy,

09:05.061 --> 09:06.896
but we're gonna have
a serious Danny Zuko problem

09:06.930 --> 09:08.263
if Blaine can't do it.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.932
What are the other options?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.266
How about Sam?

09:11.284 --> 09:12.768
He's got his heart set
on Kenickie.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.037
Uh, "Greased Lightning"
is my cell phone ringtone,

09:15.071 --> 09:17.239
and I've been knocked out
by a car door before,

09:17.273 --> 09:19.041
so I was really looking forward
to re-creating

09:19.075 --> 09:21.276
the reality
of that moment onstage.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.945
Joe hart?
Won't cut his dreads.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.279
I look like Erykah Badu.

09:26.249 --> 09:28.617
Wait, what about puck's brother?
Can't he sing?

09:28.635 --> 09:29.969
Not interested.
Why is it that we can't find

09:30.003 --> 09:32.454
one dude to play the lead
in the school play?

09:32.472 --> 09:34.039
Mercedes: Well, there aren't
a lot of dudes like you.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.307
Even Mr. Shue had that problem

09:35.342 --> 09:36.759
when he first started Glee Club.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.293
That's why he went looking
for you.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.496
(School bell ringing)

09:47.804 --> 09:50.573
(Whistle blows)

09:50.607 --> 09:52.274
Get them up!

09:52.308 --> 09:53.993
Get your knees up. Let's go.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.611
Hey, Coach.

09:55.645 --> 09:59.081
Finn. There's no prize
for running the slowest!

09:59.115 --> 10:00.616
Come on!

10:00.650 --> 10:02.585
Good-looking bunch of
recruits this year.

10:02.619 --> 10:04.086
Idiots on patrol.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.671
But I'll knock them into shape.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.122
Heck, I Coached you

10:07.156 --> 10:08.958
to a state championship.

10:08.992 --> 10:10.259
I'm kidding.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.660
You're one of a kind.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.629
I just wish
you still believed that.

10:13.663 --> 10:15.497
Thanks, Coach.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.801
It's just kind of hard to feel
that way about myself right now.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.269
Give it time.

10:20.303 --> 10:22.188
You're going through
the biggest change in your life.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.390
Guys like you
always find their way.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.111
You think you got any guys
like that out here today?

10:29.145 --> 10:31.113
Searching for some
recruits of my own.

10:31.147 --> 10:32.531
We need a male lead
for the musical.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.521
What's his story?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.356
Beiste:
Ryder Lynn, sophomore.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.542
I think he flunked out
of his old school,

10:43.577 --> 10:44.960
so they transferred him here.

10:44.995 --> 10:47.213
Sweet enough kid,

10:47.247 --> 10:49.632
but he's a loner and can't learn
to play for his life,

10:49.666 --> 10:52.051
and if you ask me,
I say he's got a lazy streak.

10:53.036 --> 10:54.703
Moves good, though.

10:54.721 --> 10:57.339
You want to know the thing about
you that makes you special?

10:57.373 --> 10:58.807
It's not the singing
or the dancing

10:58.842 --> 11:00.309
or the way you threw the ball.

11:00.343 --> 11:01.927
It's that you could move people.

11:04.014 --> 11:06.348
Figure that Ryder kid's got
anything like that in him?

11:06.382 --> 11:08.150
Bieste:
Maybe.

11:08.184 --> 11:11.237
If he had the right guy
showing him the way.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.405
Are you kidding me?
Huddle up!

11:13.440 --> 11:15.107
Get over there!

11:19.235 --> 11:20.719
(School bell ringing)

11:20.753 --> 11:22.086
Hey, this is
the girls' bathroom.

11:22.105 --> 11:24.106
I sit when I pee.

11:24.140 --> 11:26.108
How psyched are you
for <i>Grease</i> auditions?

11:26.142 --> 11:28.193
I want Sandy... so bad.

11:28.227 --> 11:29.528
I'm not auditioning.
What?!

11:29.562 --> 11:31.863
Why not?
You know you'd get a part.

11:31.898 --> 11:35.099
I don't want <i>a</i> part;
I want <i>the</i> part: Rizzo.

11:35.118 --> 11:36.601
No offense, Sandra Dee,

11:36.619 --> 11:38.269
but Rizzo's the money
role of that show.

11:38.287 --> 11:39.871
A hot bitch who thinks
she's pregnant,

11:39.906 --> 11:41.206
and turns out to have
a heart of gold.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.407
It's basically my life story.

11:42.441 --> 11:44.609
But they won't
give me the role.

11:44.627 --> 11:46.277
Everyone sees me
in drag as a joke or stunt

11:46.295 --> 11:47.946
when we're performing.

11:47.964 --> 11:49.714
But it would feel as weird
for me to play Danny Zuko

11:49.749 --> 11:50.916
as it would for you.

11:50.950 --> 11:52.634
Artie and those guys know that.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.386
Just tell them you want
to audition for Rizzo,

11:54.420 --> 11:56.221
and I'm sure they'll
give you a chance.

11:56.255 --> 11:57.806
(Toilet flushing) You know,
the casual eavesdropper,

11:57.840 --> 12:00.258
hearing the feminine
lilt of your voices,

12:00.292 --> 12:02.427
would just assume you're
a couple of regular gals

12:02.461 --> 12:04.296
yappin' away in the crapper.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.765
But then the unmistakable
scent of talcum powder

12:06.799 --> 12:09.901
and day-old panty hose
tells a different story.

12:09.936 --> 12:12.571
Well, well, well, if it isn't
McKinley High's very own

12:12.605 --> 12:16.074
Tina stomach-Turner,
and her trusty sidekick...

12:16.108 --> 12:18.142
I'm trying to think of
a mean nickname for you

12:18.161 --> 12:19.578
and I'm blanking.

12:19.612 --> 12:21.646
But you, urethra Franklin,

12:21.664 --> 12:24.166
you are a boy and you
are fooling no one.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.852
You are smuggling more
kielbasa under those gowns

12:26.886 --> 12:29.287
than a homesick Polish lady
trying to sneak through customs.

12:29.321 --> 12:31.089
You can't say things like that.

12:31.123 --> 12:32.824
Oh, I think you'll find
I can say anything I want,

12:32.842 --> 12:36.160
absolutely stunning,
kind-faced, blue-eyed girl.

12:37.964 --> 12:40.799
Now, I know full well
that gender confusion

12:40.833 --> 12:43.835
is the liberal media's
new darling,

12:43.853 --> 12:46.104
bored with drowning
the nation's airwaves

12:46.138 --> 12:48.339
with tinny sitcoms so gay
that you have to stretch

12:48.357 --> 12:50.308
a dental dam
over your television set

12:50.342 --> 12:51.776
in order to watch them safely.

12:51.811 --> 12:54.362
The Hollywood communists
are busy force-feeding us

12:54.397 --> 12:56.347
drag queen reality shows

12:56.365 --> 12:58.033
and soft profiles
of gender-confused

12:58.067 --> 13:00.619
hormone-gobbling pre-teens,

13:00.653 --> 13:02.204
who faint at the sight

13:02.238 --> 13:04.823
of their own genitals.

13:04.857 --> 13:08.210
There's no way in hell
you're gonna play Rizzo.

13:08.244 --> 13:10.061
I will not allow you

13:10.096 --> 13:11.630
to unleash a teenage maelstrom

13:11.664 --> 13:14.399
of gender-bent sexual confusion
at this school,

13:14.433 --> 13:16.134
so you can turn it around
and make it a launch party

13:16.168 --> 13:18.303
for your very own line
of male girdles

13:18.337 --> 13:20.555
and brand-new fragrance
call "nut whiff."

13:20.590 --> 13:23.374
We don't care what you say.

13:23.392 --> 13:24.976
We're both auditioning
for that musical.

Yeah! Bravo!

15:44.516 --> 15:45.867
That had more energy

15:45.901 --> 15:48.019
than the last three
auditions combined.

15:48.037 --> 15:50.538
Ladies, do you have any preference
for the parts you want to play?

15:50.573 --> 15:52.157
Sandy.
Definitely Sandy.

15:52.191 --> 15:53.708
What about you, Wade?

15:54.827 --> 15:57.078
I would like to play
the role of Rizzo.

15:59.715 --> 16:02.033
(School bell ringing)

16:11.927 --> 16:13.395
Finn:
Hey, Mr. Clippenger.

16:13.429 --> 16:16.481
Uh, you got a phone call
in the teachers' lounge.

16:16.515 --> 16:18.583
Why didn't they call my cell?

16:26.225 --> 16:27.492
Hey, what are you doing?

16:27.526 --> 16:29.060
Uh, studying.

16:29.078 --> 16:30.829
In the study hall?
I think you're the first.

16:30.863 --> 16:32.363
(Laughs) Uh...

16:32.398 --> 16:33.531
I've got to work twice
as hard as everyone else

16:33.565 --> 16:35.050
to do half as well.

16:35.084 --> 16:37.368
I'm pulling a c-minus average
since I got here,

16:37.402 --> 16:39.421
and if I don't get it
up to a B,

16:39.455 --> 16:41.739
my parents are going to make me
quit football, so...

16:41.757 --> 16:43.942
Whatever it takes, you know?

16:43.976 --> 16:45.577
I'm-I'm sorry...
who are you again?

16:45.611 --> 16:46.711
Uh, Finn is my name.

16:46.745 --> 16:47.912
I graduated last year.

16:47.930 --> 16:49.431
Played football, too.
Quarterback.

16:49.465 --> 16:52.083
Oh. Awesome.
I also had a c-minus average

16:52.101 --> 16:53.435
in my sophomore year,

16:53.469 --> 16:55.270
but I graduated with
a b-plus.

16:55.304 --> 16:56.420
Are you serious?

16:56.439 --> 16:58.389
How did you do that?
Glee Club.

16:58.423 --> 17:00.692
Learning the music and
the choreography,

17:00.726 --> 17:02.427
it just... opened up
my brain somehow.

17:02.461 --> 17:04.095
I'm not joining the Glee Club.

17:04.130 --> 17:06.196
I mean, I hear it's fun, but...

17:06.232 --> 17:08.366
I've got too much
on my plate already.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.035
Start slow, then.
Come try out for the musical.

17:11.069 --> 17:13.204
Who knows? Maybe it could be
like one of those gateway drugs.

17:13.239 --> 17:15.406
I don't sing.
Prove it.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.441
Auditions are at 4:00
in the auditorium.

17:17.460 --> 17:18.827
See you then.

17:20.663 --> 17:22.180
(School bell rings)

17:28.453 --> 17:29.921
(Sighs) Another one?

17:29.955 --> 17:32.456
I don't understand.
All I do is study.

17:32.475 --> 17:35.143
I haven't even seen <i>dark knight rises</i> yet.
Oh, it was good.

17:35.177 --> 17:37.512
Bane was a little hard
to understand, but so evil.

17:39.765 --> 17:41.099
(School bell rings)

17:41.133 --> 17:42.984
A director's job
is to make choices.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.569
You have to pick one.

17:44.603 --> 17:46.988
I-I don't know anything
about jukeboxes, Artie.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.174
Well, that one is
a zodiac jukebox,

17:49.208 --> 17:50.408
this is a wurlitzer bubbler...

17:50.442 --> 17:51.776
a knockoff, I'd imagine,

17:51.810 --> 17:53.328
because an original goes
for around 40 grand...

17:53.362 --> 17:55.446
and that one is a seeburg...
you may recognize it

17:55.480 --> 17:56.981
from the opening credits
of <i>happy days.</i>

17:56.999 --> 17:59.334
Oh! <i>Happy days</i> is a show
from the '50s,

17:59.368 --> 18:01.336
and so is <i>Grease,</i> so we should
use this one, right?

18:01.370 --> 18:03.154
No, that's the exact
one we shouldn't use.

18:03.189 --> 18:04.422
It's cliché.

18:04.456 --> 18:05.924
I say we go with the zodiac.

18:05.958 --> 18:07.959
But we're gonna have to change
the records in it.

18:07.993 --> 18:09.844
It's filled with classic rock
from the '80s.

18:15.701 --> 18:16.834
Ryder:
Hey.

18:16.852 --> 18:18.186
Hey!

18:18.220 --> 18:20.305
Auditions aren't
till 4:00, but...

18:20.339 --> 18:22.173
I just want to make sure
I'm doing everything I can

18:22.191 --> 18:23.608
to make my grades,

18:23.642 --> 18:25.176
and if I'm dumb, then so be it,

18:25.194 --> 18:26.794
but I want to be sure
I didn't miss anything.

18:26.829 --> 18:28.346
Great.
So you want to audition, then.

18:28.364 --> 18:30.798
As long as I don't have to sing.
(Laughs)

18:33.068 --> 18:35.453
You know, I, uh...
I used to be just like you.

18:35.487 --> 18:37.521
I didn't think that I
could do it, either...

18:37.540 --> 18:38.990
But then...

18:39.024 --> 18:41.326
I just did it.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.660
No thinking.

18:42.694 --> 18:44.862
I... I just started
singing and...

18:44.880 --> 18:47.131
(Jukebox crackling, whirring) It
just started coming out of me and...

18:47.166 --> 18:48.883
It felt awesome.

18:48.918 --> 18:51.169
Like a really good poop.

18:52.555 --> 18:54.956
Bet you're
a classic rock guy, right?

21:22.905 --> 21:24.355
So what do you think?

21:24.373 --> 21:26.124
Should I audition?

21:26.158 --> 21:28.159
Dude, you just did.

(Laughs)

21:41.947 --> 21:43.347

21:43.365 --> 21:45.816
Hi. I'm Ryder Lynn.

21:45.850 --> 21:47.318
I know.

21:47.352 --> 21:49.486
I saw you in the football
game on Saturday.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.039
You're end zone dances
are awesome.

21:52.073 --> 21:54.691
Ah...
I'm Marley.

21:54.709 --> 21:58.028
I know. I know.
Uh, your mom rules.

21:58.046 --> 22:00.381
She always sneaks me extra
meatballs on spaghetti day.

22:00.415 --> 22:01.415
Really?
Uh-huh.

22:01.466 --> 22:02.550
(Both laugh)

22:02.584 --> 22:03.918
Wow, she must really like you.

22:03.969 --> 22:05.836
Uh, Finn Hudson told me
that you were probably

22:05.870 --> 22:07.338
gonna play Sandy
in the school play.

22:07.372 --> 22:10.841
I thought if we were gonna be
working together, I should say hi.

22:10.875 --> 22:12.259
I think they want me
to play Danny.

22:12.310 --> 22:14.878
What's that cologne you're
wearing, "jealousy by you"?

22:14.896 --> 22:16.513
Uh, what am I jealous of?

22:16.547 --> 22:18.766
Oh, just your girlfriend talking
to the hottest guy at McKinley

22:18.817 --> 22:20.901
who also happens to be
a star football player

22:20.936 --> 22:23.687
with yummy old-school
Justin Bieber hair.

22:23.721 --> 22:24.855
She's not my girlfriend.

22:24.889 --> 22:27.057
And who wants
Justin Bieber hair?

22:27.075 --> 22:29.276
Half-black guys
who can't grow it.

22:29.327 --> 22:32.079
Sorry, but you had that coming
since you broke up with me.

22:32.113 --> 22:33.614
And nobody breaks up with me.

22:33.665 --> 22:36.083
Which is why I've been
telling people I dumped you

22:36.117 --> 22:37.701
because you have
a gross third nipple.

22:37.735 --> 22:39.286
Now, if you'll excuse me...

22:43.508 --> 22:44.708
Hey, Ryder.
Hey, Mona.

22:44.742 --> 22:45.960
It's Marley.

22:46.011 --> 22:48.128
Oh, right, "Marley,"
like the dead dog movie?

22:49.414 --> 22:51.932
I heard you killed
your <i>Grease</i> audition.

22:51.967 --> 22:54.602
And I know you're excited about
the prospect of playing Sandy

22:54.636 --> 22:56.437
because everyone knows
poor people don't have

22:56.471 --> 22:57.921
many opportunities to
actually enjoy anything.

22:57.939 --> 22:59.223
Which is why it's gonna be

22:59.257 --> 23:01.108
such a bummer when I
take the part from you.

23:01.142 --> 23:02.926
You're auditioning?
I am.

23:02.944 --> 23:05.562
By the way, Ryder, you should
know about this one's gene pool.

23:05.596 --> 23:07.147
She's only got a month or two
before she starts ballooning

23:07.198 --> 23:09.066
to her natural weight
of 5,000 pounds

23:09.100 --> 23:11.969
and starts writing her memoir,
<i>fifty shades of gravy.</i>

23:12.003 --> 23:12.820
Wow, you're kind of a bitch.

23:12.871 --> 23:13.937
What'd she ever do to you?

23:13.955 --> 23:15.272
Besides trying to steal away

23:15.290 --> 23:17.291
my three-nippled
ex-boyfriend?

23:17.325 --> 23:19.576
You cast yourself
as the poor little

23:19.610 --> 23:20.594
simply adork-able
nice girl.

23:20.629 --> 23:21.945
But I know, and you know,

23:21.963 --> 23:23.780
and sweet baby Jesus
in the manger knows

23:23.798 --> 23:28.002
what you really are: A
scheming little kiss-ass.

23:28.053 --> 23:30.638
I'm single, by the way.

23:31.723 --> 23:33.891
(School bell ringing)

23:35.727 --> 23:38.012
Sign me up, too.

23:38.063 --> 23:40.630
I thought you were too cool
for the school play.

23:40.649 --> 23:42.850
Someone's got to keep you
from killing Marley.

23:42.901 --> 23:44.968
And keep Marley from
fornicating Ryder.

23:44.986 --> 23:47.321
I'm not as dumb as
you look, Puckerman.

23:47.355 --> 23:50.941

That was great, guys.

25:58.953 --> 26:02.272
Okay, we need to do that thing
where we call people back.

26:02.290 --> 26:03.490
What's that called?

26:03.541 --> 26:05.125
Both:
Callbacks.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.911
I don't know. I feel like Kitty
has the inside track on Sandy.

26:07.945 --> 26:08.996
Sandy can't be brunette.

26:09.047 --> 26:10.447
Oh, like Maria
couldn't be black?

26:10.465 --> 26:12.749
That was a year ago,
Mercedes. Let it go.

26:12.783 --> 26:16.420

26:20.308 --> 26:21.642
It's too bad she won't audition

26:21.676 --> 26:24.144
because she refuses to be
in the same room with Mike.

26:24.179 --> 26:25.979
Okay, what about Rizzo?

26:26.014 --> 26:28.348
Now, I know it's way outside
of the box,

26:28.399 --> 26:30.017
but I like Unique for it.

26:30.068 --> 26:31.134
He wants it so badly.

26:31.152 --> 26:32.769
He's the best singer, too.

26:32.803 --> 26:35.639
So, we cast a brunette
as Sandy and a guy as Rizzo.

26:35.657 --> 26:37.658
Who's directing this, Julie Taymor?
Think about how cool

26:37.692 --> 26:39.476
it would be to do something
really different.

26:39.494 --> 26:41.328
Though I don't agree
with your choices,

26:41.362 --> 26:43.447
I appreciate your passion.

26:43.481 --> 26:45.999
It's nice to have
the old Finn back.

26:46.034 --> 26:47.618
Sue:
Finn Hudson?

26:47.652 --> 26:50.537
In Principal Figgins'
office now.

26:51.923 --> 26:54.291
Now, fatty!
(Bell ringing)

26:54.325 --> 26:56.126
The twin idiots seated
before you are poised

26:56.160 --> 26:59.329
to cast the she-male-fabulous
Unique Adams

26:59.347 --> 27:00.848
as Rizzo in <i>Grease;</i>

27:00.882 --> 27:02.649
The already overly sexualized
minstrel show

27:02.684 --> 27:06.687
featuring teen pregnancy
and the ridiculously unnecessary

27:06.721 --> 27:08.305
lubrication of lightning.

27:08.339 --> 27:10.807
If they succeed,
they will set a legal precedent

27:10.841 --> 27:13.477
that will clear the way
for Unique to become a Cheerio!

27:13.511 --> 27:16.480
In the very year that I am set
to notch my 1,000th

27:16.514 --> 27:19.316
tournament victory
and become the winningest coach

27:19.350 --> 27:21.034
in cheerleading history.

27:21.069 --> 27:23.320
Wait. When did Unique say
he wanted to be a Cheerio!?

27:23.354 --> 27:24.488
Sue, I don't understand.

27:24.522 --> 27:26.490
Unique Adams is nothing more

27:26.524 --> 27:28.525
than an attractive,
buxom young woman

27:28.543 --> 27:31.528
who's got it going on
in all the right places.

27:31.546 --> 27:32.746
She's a brick house, Sue!

27:32.797 --> 27:35.165
Uh, Principal Figgins,
Sue's right about that.

27:35.199 --> 27:37.584
Unique is definitely a guy.

27:37.635 --> 27:39.586
What? I don't see
what the big deal is.

27:39.637 --> 27:41.889
If Unique identifies as a girl
and dresses

27:41.923 --> 27:44.341
as a girl, she should be allowed
to play one onstage.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.876
Cross-gendered casting
is as old as theater itself.

27:46.895 --> 27:49.713
In Shakespeare's time, all the
female roles were played by men.

27:49.731 --> 27:50.681
There's no way that's true.

27:50.715 --> 27:52.015
In the last few years,

27:52.050 --> 27:53.233
McKinley's become
the kind of place

27:53.268 --> 27:55.152
where all kinds of outcasts
can feel free

27:55.186 --> 27:58.021
to follow their dreams.
I don't think that should change

27:58.055 --> 27:59.907
just because
Coach Sylvester's a bigot.

27:59.941 --> 28:02.826
You know, I'd think twice
about calling someone a bigot

28:02.860 --> 28:05.329
who's had gay Cheerios!, both
male and female on her squad,

28:05.363 --> 28:07.664
and who resigned her post
as principal in protest

28:07.699 --> 28:09.333
because this school
wasn't doing enough

28:09.367 --> 28:11.335
to protect a gay student
from being bullied!

28:11.369 --> 28:13.236
But you do have a point there,
mashed potato pants.

28:13.254 --> 28:14.705
We've become somewhat of a

28:14.739 --> 28:17.240
progressive bubble here at
McKinley High, and I think

28:17.258 --> 28:19.676
that's due to the fact
that the Glee Club is being run

28:19.711 --> 28:21.745
by a strange, weepy man-child
who has lotion

28:21.763 --> 28:23.547
in his hair,
but no adult friends.

28:23.581 --> 28:24.765
We live in Ohio.

28:24.799 --> 28:27.434
And if you choose to cast Rizzo
with a naive,

28:27.468 --> 28:28.769
gender-confused boy

28:28.803 --> 28:32.773
in a dress,
I guarantee you someone...

28:32.807 --> 28:35.275
Is going to raise
a very public stink about it,

28:35.310 --> 28:37.444
and I don't think that's fair.

28:37.478 --> 28:40.063
Don't put this kid in danger
because you want to make

28:40.097 --> 28:43.400
some grand gesture
about how open-minded you are.

28:43.434 --> 28:45.953
William, I spent the last year

28:45.987 --> 28:48.104
stifling my natural hatred
for you and helping you win

28:48.122 --> 28:50.607
a Glee Club
national championship.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.376
Now is your moment
to pay me back by putting

28:52.410 --> 28:54.277
a stop to this
so I don't have to.

28:54.295 --> 28:55.579
It's not my call, Sue.

28:55.613 --> 28:57.297
Finn and Artie are running
the musical this year,

28:57.332 --> 28:58.615
and I trust them implicitly.

28:58.633 --> 29:00.884
Enough! With all due respect,

29:00.918 --> 29:02.469
this is none of your business.

29:02.503 --> 29:04.972
I'm the director.
It's my decision.

29:05.006 --> 29:07.457
William, maybe you need to
remind chubby-wan-Kenobi

29:07.475 --> 29:10.260
of the daily nightmare that is
borne of being my enemy.

29:10.294 --> 29:11.645
You can't threaten me, Sue.

29:11.679 --> 29:14.964
I've already lost my girlfriend,
my future, my pride.

29:14.983 --> 29:16.466
I've nothing more to lose.

29:16.484 --> 29:18.935
I'm casting Unique,
and that's all there is to it.

29:18.969 --> 29:22.105
And you know, I thought
that you would have known more

29:22.139 --> 29:24.241
about being an underdog after
you helped us win nationals

29:24.275 --> 29:25.942
and had a retarded baby,
but you...

29:28.696 --> 29:31.248
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.

29:31.282 --> 29:34.951
That... that was the wrong word
to use. I apologize.

29:44.379 --> 29:46.496
(School bell ringing)

29:49.537 --> 29:52.872
You look more crooked
than Joe Theismann's leg.

29:52.906 --> 29:54.791
It's just these places that the
realtor in Washington sent us.

29:54.842 --> 29:55.792
They all have carpeting.

29:55.843 --> 29:56.909
You know how many germs

29:56.927 --> 29:58.044
and bugs and fluids
live in carpeting?

29:58.078 --> 29:59.179
Call Stanley Steemer.

29:59.213 --> 30:00.913
Cleaned carpets
that don't dry properly

30:00.931 --> 30:03.216
can create kawasaki syndrome.

30:03.250 --> 30:07.520
You know what the worst thing
you can do in a relationship is?

30:07.555 --> 30:09.856
Besides hitting, of course?
Lie.

30:09.890 --> 30:12.108
You don't want to go
with Will to Washington.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.110
I saw it in your face
when you told him you would.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.863
I have reservations; That is
much different from lying.

30:16.897 --> 30:18.281
You know what they say
about reservations?

30:18.315 --> 30:20.700
They won't seat you
till the whole party's there.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.769
Dishonesty eats away
at a marriage.

30:22.787 --> 30:24.070
You have to tell him
you don't want to go.

30:24.104 --> 30:26.289
I can't. I can't get in the way
of his dreams.

30:26.323 --> 30:27.540
That's what Terri did.

30:27.575 --> 30:31.294
Pumpkin, Will loves you

30:31.328 --> 30:34.080
like a farmer loves
his blue ribbon pig.

30:34.114 --> 30:37.584
He'll understand.

30:37.618 --> 30:41.588
I'm going. It's decided.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.757
Then you'd better find
something to get excited about

30:43.791 --> 30:45.091
doing down there besides him.

30:45.125 --> 30:47.477
You know I love Will,
but I think you've spent

30:47.511 --> 30:50.063
so much time working on being
his girl that you forgot

30:50.097 --> 30:52.982
that the reason he's so into you
is because of all the things

30:53.017 --> 30:54.934
you are <i>besides</i> that.

30:59.824 --> 31:03.076
(School bell ringing) I've been
trying to see you since I got here,

31:03.110 --> 31:05.812
but every time I get
near you, you disappear.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.497
I was fine with our breakup.

31:07.531 --> 31:09.616
Out of sight, out of mind.
But maybe you

31:09.650 --> 31:11.751
could have called and asked
if I could handle you

31:11.786 --> 31:13.169
choreographing
the school musical!

31:13.204 --> 31:15.171
I'm sorry. Artie called me.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.824
It seemed like a fun idea.
I didn't think you'd be upset.

31:17.842 --> 31:19.626
Neither did I!

31:19.660 --> 31:21.594
I know this is weird.
It's weird for me, too,

31:21.629 --> 31:22.846
but if that's
what's stopping you

31:22.880 --> 31:24.163
from auditioning for <i>Grease,</i>

31:24.181 --> 31:26.015
then we have to
make this not weird.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.834
There are still some
good parts left.

31:27.852 --> 31:29.602
I'm sorry, I can't.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.355
We could use you.
You're so talented.

31:32.389 --> 31:35.391
I'm sorry. You're gonna have
to survive without my talent.

31:36.510 --> 31:37.811
(Sighs)

31:37.845 --> 31:39.779
(School bell ringing)

31:39.814 --> 31:42.348
All right! You guys
killed your auditions,

31:42.366 --> 31:46.853
but there can only be one Sandy
and there can only be one Danny.

31:46.871 --> 31:48.855
The heart of <i>Grease</i>
is the Danny-Sandy romance.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.023
This callback is all
about the chemistry.

31:51.041 --> 31:54.377
We want to see how well you play
off each other. Is there heat?

31:54.411 --> 31:56.996
Finn: We also want to see how
you sing and dance '50s-stye.

31:57.030 --> 31:59.215
That's why we gave you the
audition song ahead of time.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.000
I don't really read
music, so...

32:01.035 --> 32:02.802
Mike:
It's okay.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.221
Mercedes and I will get you started.
Kitty: Start away.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.807
Everyone knows Kitty cat's
gonna finish it.

32:07.842 --> 32:09.976
Oh, you have a lot
of attitude, little girl.

32:10.010 --> 32:13.880
Let's see if you have the stuff
to back it up. Hit it.

32:13.898 --> 32:16.215

(Whooping, laughing)

34:34.212 --> 34:36.614
(School bell ringing)

34:40.402 --> 34:43.286
Hey. I came to talk
to you about the play.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.389
I get it.

34:45.399 --> 34:47.317
I heard about
Coach Sylvester's meltdown.

34:48.619 --> 34:50.436
I want to offer you the part.

34:52.739 --> 34:54.858
but what about Coach Sue?

34:54.891 --> 34:56.458
Well, Coach Sue isn't
directing the play.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.078
I am.

34:58.112 --> 35:01.197
So now all you got to worry
about is getting a curly way

35:01.227 --> 35:03.497
***

35:03.617 --> 35:05.118
and I'll take care of Coach Sue

35:05.152 --> 35:08.238
or anybody else who
might try and st us.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.874
Unique knows the song
and has the wig.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.342
Good.

35:14.762 --> 35:17.063
You okay?

35:17.098 --> 35:19.833
I feel right
the men's locker room.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.634
But I can't go into the girls'.

35:21.669 --> 35:24.988
And I don't feel right
in men's clothing,

35:25.022 --> 35:27.907
but I can't wear
dresses every day.

35:32.630 --> 35:36.082
It's just nice, for once,

35:39.837 --> 35:42.005
yeah, it is.

35:44.658 --> 35:46.343
Well, uh...

35:46.377 --> 35:48.661
(Sniffs)

35:48.679 --> 35:50.296
Before I post the cast list,

35:50.330 --> 35:51.915
I just need to Kat you're ready.

35:51.949 --> 35:53.433
'Cause there's gonna be
a lot of heat on you,

35:53.467 --> 35:55.802
and like I said, I can shield
you from some of it, but...

35:55.836 --> 35:57.303
At the end of the day,
you're gonna be the one

35:57.337 --> 35:58.738
out on that stage.

36:02.460 --> 36:03.877
(School bell ringing)

36:32.539 --> 36:34.891
All right, all right.

37:05.739 --> 37:08.108
(Laughing)

37:15.950 --> 37:17.784
Patty Simcox?

37:18.803 --> 37:20.770
Patty Simcox?

37:20.805 --> 37:22.555
Who the hell is Patty Simcox?

37:24.708 --> 37:25.925
I don't understand.

37:25.943 --> 37:28.061
I pray really hard about this.

37:28.095 --> 37:29.512
Maybe God didn't hear you
because he was busy

37:29.547 --> 37:32.782
helping people with cancer.
Shut it, Avatar.

37:32.817 --> 37:35.084
This is all your fault.
You screwed up "hand -jive."

37:35.086 --> 37:37.287
No, I didn't.
We were both great.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.405
It just didn't work out.

37:39.439 --> 37:40.924
I've been hearing that
a lot lately from you.

37:43.494 --> 37:45.812
Oh. One little thing,
honey boo boo.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.630
I know a good, hot meal
is hard to resist,

37:47.632 --> 37:50.083
especially when you're on
the free lunch program

37:50.117 --> 37:53.286
but remember, the stage always
*** at least ten pounds.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.638
In your case, it's close to 90.

37:55.673 --> 37:56.848
So, when you and your mom,
strawberry hugryake,

37:56.866 --> 37:58.819
are dumpster diving for your costume,

37:58.828 --> 38:01.227
keep on picking till you
find something slimming.

38:01.262 --> 38:03.963
Like a back hefty bag.

38:03.981 --> 38:06.432
Kitty, my baby needs to be fed.

38:37.313 --> 38:39.865
Emma, wow.

38:42.001 --> 38:43.835
Did I forget it's one of
our anniversaries?

38:43.870 --> 38:46.321
What? No.
(Sighs)

38:46.339 --> 38:48.290
Your parents aren't
here, are they?

38:48.324 --> 38:50.125
No no no. No, no.
I just thought I would, um,

38:50.159 --> 38:51.960
challenge myself with
a few new recipes, that's all.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.962
Okay. How many new recipes?

38:53.996 --> 38:56.598
Uh, two or three.
Or seven. Sorry.

38:56.632 --> 38:58.016
If you want, in just a couple
minutes, they'll be ready.

38:58.051 --> 38:59.685
Just let them cool for a second.

38:59.719 --> 39:02.104
Um...,
I just got home early

39:02.138 --> 39:04.272
and I, uh, came across
these cookbooks

39:04.307 --> 39:06.508
my mom got me when I got married
to Carl, and I thought you'd like it.

39:06.526 --> 39:08.510
You know what? I've never
tried these. And I feel like

39:08.528 --> 39:10.812
I do that sometimes, and it's
really not fair. Emma... ma.

39:10.814 --> 39:12.114
Sometimes I need to try...
Emma.

39:12.148 --> 39:14.116
Emma, stop.

39:14.150 --> 39:16.535
Just... whatever it is,

39:16.569 --> 39:18.987
just say it.

39:20.573 --> 39:22.991
I don't want to go to
Washington with you.

39:28.331 --> 39:30.716
Could you just sit down?

39:31.834 --> 39:34.202
Just hear me out.

39:39.041 --> 39:41.209
(Clears throat)
For the past three years,

39:41.227 --> 39:44.012
all I've wanted
was to be your wife.

39:44.046 --> 39:45.731
But then when I rely
stop to think about that,

39:45.765 --> 39:47.232
I have no idea what
that means to me,

39:47.266 --> 39:48.650
to be a wife.

39:48.684 --> 39:50.152
You know? I, um...

39:50.186 --> 39:52.821
I know what it meant to my mom.
It meant, you know,

39:52.855 --> 39:54.523
having supper on the table
when my dad got home.

39:54.557 --> 39:56.858
It meant lots of
"whatever you say, dear"s.

39:56.892 --> 39:58.894
It was heroic doses of
clonopin and chardonnay, and...

39:58.928 --> 40:01.079
That's not the life I want.
I know.

40:01.114 --> 40:03.081
I love you.

40:03.116 --> 40:05.233
I love you, but I love my job.

40:05.268 --> 40:06.585
I love my kids.

40:06.619 --> 40:08.203
I love helping my kids.

40:08.237 --> 40:09.588
I love that you love your job,

40:09.622 --> 40:11.089
and I... I am so
incredibly excited

40:11.124 --> 40:13.508
for this job opportunity
for you, I really am.

40:13.543 --> 40:16.044
But I am terrified

40:16.078 --> 40:17.745
that if I go with you,
I'm gonna resent you.

40:17.764 --> 40:19.247
And then I'm gonna pull away.

40:19.265 --> 40:20.882
I would rather be here,

40:20.916 --> 40:22.750
far from you
but feeling really close,

40:22.769 --> 40:26.087
rather than close to you
but feeling really far away.

40:29.258 --> 40:30.859
You upset?

40:30.893 --> 40:32.093
No.

40:32.111 --> 40:34.196
I me...

40:34.230 --> 40:35.930
Do I like the idea of
not waking up next to you

40:35.948 --> 40:37.199
every day for a few months?

40:37.233 --> 40:38.600
Of course not.

40:38.618 --> 40:40.786
But you're right.

40:40.820 --> 40:42.404
I've spent so much
time talking about

40:42.438 --> 40:45.073
getting married,
and no time talking about

40:45.107 --> 40:47.909
what being a husband and
wife really means to us.

40:51.447 --> 40:53.965
What does it mean to you?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.051
Trust.

40:56.085 --> 41:00.138
Having a partner I know I will
always be honest with me.

41:00.173 --> 41:02.974
Who I know I will
always be honest with.

41:03.009 --> 41:04.593
What about you?

41:04.627 --> 41:06.928
Someone to accept me.

41:06.962 --> 41:08.430
All of me.

41:08.464 --> 41:11.483
Someone who I accept and adore.

41:11.517 --> 41:14.269
Neither of us said someone
who is with me every minute,

41:14.303 --> 41:16.771
or compromises their dreamsine.

41:16.773 --> 41:18.306
No.

41:18.324 --> 41:21.142
So... Then I guess
we're okay.

41:22.811 --> 41:26.281
Um... we will
switch off weekends.

41:26.315 --> 41:27.415
I'll come up or
you'll come down.

41:27.450 --> 41:28.583
And then I will come home,

41:28.618 --> 41:31.219
and then we will
finally get married.

41:33.539 --> 41:35.624
(School bell ringing)

41:35.658 --> 41:37.008
How you doing, buddy?

41:37.043 --> 41:38.760
Yeah. Good. But...

41:38.794 --> 41:40.828
How am I supposed to make
a car fly onstage

41:40.847 --> 41:43.682
in the auditorium?
(Laughs)

41:43.716 --> 41:45.333
You're really throwing yourself
into the musical, huh?

41:45.351 --> 41:46.852
I guess they're wrong

41:46.854 --> 41:50.639
when they say you
can't go home again.

41:50.673 --> 41:53.191
Well, it's not about being
back in high school again.

41:53.226 --> 41:54.476
I'm not interested in that.

41:54.510 --> 41:56.478
I guess it's just...

41:56.512 --> 41:59.197
Nice helping other people's
dreams come true.

41:59.232 --> 42:01.566
It's called being a teacher.

42:02.851 --> 42:04.202
I'm really gonna miss it.

42:05.488 --> 42:07.188
Wait, what do you mean?

42:07.206 --> 42:09.341
I'm leaving.

42:09.375 --> 42:10.825
Not-not for good,

42:10.859 --> 42:12.043
but for a few months.

42:12.078 --> 42:13.662
I'm going to Washington

42:13.696 --> 42:15.480
to fight to keep the as
alive in our schools.

42:15.515 --> 42:17.132
I figure if I don't
take a stand now,

42:17.166 --> 42:19.217
there won't be auditoriums
left to fly cars in.

42:19.252 --> 42:22.504
But, Mr. Shue, you can't just
leave the Glee Club like that,

42:22.538 --> 42:24.005
with no one in charge.
They need you.

42:24.039 --> 42:25.340
(Sigh)

42:25.374 --> 42:27.041
No, they need a leader.

42:29.729 --> 42:31.045
Someone who understands
how to win,

42:31.063 --> 42:32.647
but also understands that winning

42:32.682 --> 42:35.383
is not more important than
doing the right thing,

42:35.401 --> 42:37.235
or taking care of each other.

42:37.270 --> 42:39.521
Someone who's really good at
making kids' dreams come true.

42:39.555 --> 42:41.239
I spoke to Principal
Figgins about it,

42:41.274 --> 42:43.558
and since Glee Club
is not an actual class,

42:43.576 --> 42:46.161
we don't need a certified
teacher to run it.

42:46.195 --> 42:47.696
We just need an adult.

42:47.730 --> 42:50.665
Mr. Shue, I'm not an adult.
First of all,

42:50.700 --> 42:53.201
I think maybe it's time
you start calling me Will.

42:53.235 --> 42:55.403
And second how
you stood up to Sue.

42:55.421 --> 42:57.071
How you went out and found Ryder.

42:57.089 --> 42:58.873
You're ready.

42:58.907 --> 43:01.426
And if you're willing, then
I can promise you that

43:01.460 --> 43:03.011
there's no greater
joy in the world

43:03.045 --> 43:05.545
than helping a young boy
like you turn into a man.

43:08.006 --> 43:09.385
It's three months.

43:09.915 --> 43:10.887
So what are you doing?

43:12.027 --> 43:13.671
Will you take over the Glee Club?
