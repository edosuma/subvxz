00:01.084 --> 00:05.879
[MUSIC]

00:07.882 --> 00:09.800
OH, MY GOD.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.468
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

00:11.636 --> 00:13.429
IT SOUNDS
LIKE A BLOODY HOOK

00:13.596 --> 00:17.266
SCRAPING AGAINST
THE BACK DOOR.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.601
WHAT'S...
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:19.769 --> 00:21.895
YOU'RE LIKE A MILLION
MILES AWAY.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.397
I DON'T... I DON'T...

00:23.565 --> 00:24.690
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT
MY PARENTS ARE FIGHTING

00:24.858 --> 00:26.442
LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.193
IT JUST MAKES ME SO MAD.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.238
LIKE I WANT TO KICK
THEIR ASSES, BUT I CAN'T.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.866
BUT I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.995
OKAY.

00:39.998 --> 00:43.000
TAKE ME, DONNA.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.627
WHAT?

00:45.795 --> 00:46.962
GO AHEAD. TAKE ME.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.464
PUNISH YOUR PARENTS
BY USING ME FOR SEX.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.090
DO YOUR BUSINESS AND BE
DONE WITH IT. GO AHEAD.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.592
DON'T BE SHY.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.303
I CAN TAKE IT.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.971
BUT... GOD,

00:56.139 --> 00:59.516
DO BE GENTLE.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.686
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK
THAT WAS GONNA WORK, DID YOU?

01:02.854 --> 01:06.273
NO, BUT I'M A VIRGIN, AND
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.608
BUT THAT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT...

01:07.776 --> 01:10.944
NO, WAIT. YES, IT IS.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.530
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

01:13.698 --> 01:14.865
DO WHAT?

01:15.033 --> 01:16.617
YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.828
UH...
WELL, THANK YOU.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.461
I LOVE YOU, ERIC.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.096

HELLO, WISCONSIN!

02:17.554 --> 02:18.971
MORNING, BOB.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.432
MORNING, RED.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.814
PROBABLY WONDERING WHY
I'M IN YOUR CAR, HUH?

02:29.566 --> 02:30.732
NO.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.735
JUST GET OUT
AND HAVE A NICE DAY.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.446
MIDGIE AND I
GOT INTO A FIGHT, RED,

02:36.614 --> 02:38.407
AND I WALKED OUT.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.451
GUESS THAT'LL
TEACH HER, RIGHT?

02:41.619 --> 02:44.746
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
SLEEPING IN THE CAR, BOB.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.915
RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE
WHEN I STORMED OUT,

02:47.083 --> 02:48.584
I SORT OF FORGOT
SOME STUFF.

02:48.751 --> 02:54.131
YOU KNOW, KEYS,
WALLET, BLOW DRYER.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.592
ALL I NEED NOW
IS A PLACE TO STAY.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.595
MAYBE WITH SOME FRIENDS.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.264
WELL, UH...

03:02.432 --> 03:07.519
WE DON'T, UH, HAVE
A BLOW DRYER, BOB.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.980
OH. LAURIE'S
GOT A BLOW DRYER.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.609
I KNOW 'CAUSE SHE'S GOT
THAT FARRAH FAWCETT HAIRDO.

03:13.776 --> 03:17.404
THAT'S NOT NATURAL.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.407
YOU... YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
EVEN NEED MY OWN ROOM.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.202
JUST A LITTLE CORNER
TO SLEEP IN.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.454
BOB, I REAL...

03:25.622 --> 03:27.831
I MEAN, WE JUS...

03:27.999 --> 03:31.376
AW, CRIPES.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.337
OKAY.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.880
OH, THANKS, RED.

03:35.048 --> 03:39.259
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.304
NO, I'M NOT.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.019
DO YOU THINK WHEN
GIRLS HAVE SLEEPOVERS,

03:49.187 --> 03:52.147
SOMETIMES THEY... THEY
PLAY GAMES AND GIGGLE,

03:52.315 --> 03:54.066
AND THEN, EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE,

03:54.234 --> 03:55.734
THEY START TO MAKE
OUT ALL TOGETHER

03:55.902 --> 04:01.990
IN A BIG NAKED HEAP?

04:02.158 --> 04:03.492
I SURE HOPE SO.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.369
ME, TOO.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.162
A-HE-HE-HE-HEM!

04:07.330 --> 04:08.747
MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.958
I WOULD LIKE
TO INTRODUCE TO YOU ALL

04:11.125 --> 04:14.795
THE NEW MICHAEL KELSO!

04:15.380 --> 04:17.631
YEAH.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.008
SO, HUH,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:20.176 --> 04:22.552
YEAH. JACKIE SAYS IT MAKES
ME LOOK LIKE MARLON BRANDO

04:22.720 --> 04:24.805
IN THE WILD ONES.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.684
YEAH. I'M SO BRANDO.

04:28.851 --> 04:33.355
YEAH, IF BRANDO
HAD A BUDDY NAMED POTSIE.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.024
WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN SAYING?

04:36.192 --> 04:37.401
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

04:37.568 --> 04:40.779
AAAAAAY!

04:40.947 --> 04:43.615
JACKIE, DID YOU DRESS
ME UP LIKE THE FONZ?

04:44.534 --> 04:47.244
NO, MICHAEL, I DID NOT
DRESS YOU UP LIKE THE FONZ.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.662
ALTHOUGH, I MEAN,
I LIKE THE FONZ.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.163
I THINK, HE'S YOU KNOW,
KIND OF... FEZ!

04:50.331 --> 04:51.832
FONZ?
YES OR NO?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.166
WELL, YOU KNOW ME,
KELSO.

04:53.334 --> 04:56.920
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.422
THANK YOU, FEZ.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.215
NOW, IF I COULD JUST HAVE
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.591
Kelso: SURE.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.428
GOOD, YES.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.930
OKAY, A GANG OF TOUGHS HAS
TAKEN OVER ARNOLD'S.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.225
HELP US, FONZIE.
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE!

05:15.148 --> 05:16.565
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.525
HERE I AM
AS BRANDO AS CAN BE,

05:18.693 --> 05:21.778
AND YOU GUYS CAN'T
EVEN SEE THAT.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.322
WELL, YOU CAN BOTH
JUST...

05:23.489 --> 05:26.241
SIT ON IT?

05:26.909 --> 05:30.287
AAAAY!

05:30.455 --> 05:32.664
MICHAEL!

05:33.499 --> 05:36.626
WHY IS BOB
IN MY BATHTUB?

05:37.628 --> 05:38.920
YOU TOLD ME
YOU SENT HIM HOME.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.298
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID:
"HE WENT HOME."

05:41.466 --> 05:43.216
HE DID GO HOME...

05:43.384 --> 05:46.178
AND THEN MIDGE KICKED HIM OUT.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.763
BUT HE WENT HOME.

05:47.930 --> 05:51.183
WELL, NOW HE'S BACK.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.561
RED, HE'S IN MY BATHTUB.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.230
I CAN'T HAVE HIM
IN MY BATHTUB.

05:57.398 --> 06:00.442
HIS AFRO GEL
IS GONNA LEAVE A RING.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.989
THIS ISN'T EASY ON ME,
EITHER, KITTY.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.910
HE TRIED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT HIS FEELINGS.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.579
HE ALMOST STARTED TO CRY.

06:12.747 --> 06:16.249
I REALLY WANTED
TO PUNCH HIM!

06:16.417 --> 06:17.876
BOB CAN'T STAY HERE,
RED.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.503
I KNOW THAT MAKES ME
A BAD PERSON.

06:19.670 --> 06:23.465
I DON'T CARE. I'M BAD, SO LET'S
JUST GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

06:25.343 --> 06:28.678
WELL, THEN GO TALK TO MIDGE
AND FIX IT UP.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.807
AH HA HA HA.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.934
NO. YOU LET
THE STRAY IN.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.104
YOU FIND HIM A HOME.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.273
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE,
KITTY.

06:40.441 --> 06:44.027
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO TO
MY UNHAPPY PLACE, RED?

06:49.283 --> 06:52.369
I'LL TALK TO MIDGE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.538
THANK YOU, RED. YOU'RE
A WONDERFUL HUSBAND.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.581
NOW, WHEN YOU'RE
DONE WITH THE PAPER,

06:56.749 --> 06:59.751
YOU GET UPSTAIRS
AND SCRUB MY TUB.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.005
OKAY. YOU'RE DONE!

07:05.925 --> 07:08.135
I WON'T DO IT.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.721
WELL, I WON'T, EITHER.

07:13.474 --> 07:17.227
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL WE'RE GONNA DO.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.481
KELSO, IT WAS BRAVE OF YOU
TO COME BACK.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.234
WE GAVE YOU QUITE A RIBBING.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.111
YEAH...

07:26.279 --> 07:27.988
'CEPT FOR THIS TIME,

07:28.156 --> 07:29.990
I BROUGHT
A HOT, FRESH PIZZA.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.910
BUT IT'S ONLY FOR MY FRIENDS
WHO DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.872
MMM! PIZZA!

07:37.039 --> 07:39.708
KELSO, MAN,
I GOT A THOUSAND INSULTS,

07:39.876 --> 07:41.877
AND NO PIZZA'S GONNA MAKE...

07:42.044 --> 07:44.880
IS THAT SAUSAGE?

07:45.047 --> 07:48.842
YOU BRILLIANT BASTARD!

07:49.010 --> 07:50.510
GUYS, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.471
DONNA TOLD ME SHE LOVES ME,

07:52.638 --> 07:56.391
AND THEN I TOLD HER
I LOVE CAKE.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.186
THAT'S NOT BAD, IS IT?

07:59.353 --> 08:02.939
I'M STILL COOL, RIGHT?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.530
OKAY. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.073
I JUST PANICKED,
AND IT POPPED OUT.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.910
I MEAN, I DON'T REMEMBER
WANTING TO EVER

08:15.077 --> 08:17.120
TALK ABOUT CAKE.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.331
I WASN'T REALLY THAT HUNGRY.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.957
CAKE IS GOOD,

08:21.125 --> 08:24.711
BUT YOU CANNOT HAVE SEX
WITH CAKE.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.464
OF COURSE, YOU CANNOT HAVE
SEX WITH DONNA, EITHER, SO...

08:27.632 --> 08:28.840
YEAH, MAN.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.551
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST LIED AND
TOLD HER THAT YOU LOVED HER.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.012
"I LOVE YOU, BABY."

08:34.180 --> 08:36.640
SEE? AND I DON'T LOVE YOU.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

08:36.807 --> 08:39.476
HE DOES LOVE HER, YOU DOPE.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.144
RIGHT?

08:41.312 --> 08:45.065
OKAY. WELL, IF I ADMIT IT, ARE
YOU GUYS GONNA MAKE FUN OF ME?

08:45.233 --> 08:47.651
OH, EDDIE.
LOVE IS NOT A JOKE.

08:47.818 --> 08:50.612
THIS IS A JOKE:
KNOCK, KNOCK.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.739
WHO'S THERE?

08:52.907 --> 08:54.574
YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY DO
LOVE HER,

08:54.742 --> 08:57.577
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
TO DO, MAN.

08:57.745 --> 09:01.289
YOU GOTTA DUMP HER
AND LIVE FREE! HA HA HA!

09:02.959 --> 09:05.252
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, MAN.
HE'S STUPID.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.795
HERE'S WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.797
SHE SAID IT,
SO NOW YOU GOTTA SAY IT.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.424
THEN SHE'LL SAY IT BACK,
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.093
OH, AND GET HER PIZZA

09:13.261 --> 09:17.430
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW
I KINDA LOVE KELSO.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.140
YEAH. YEAH, I CAN DO THAT.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.685
I'LL JUST SAY IT, AND
I'LL BE BACK ON TOP AGAIN.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.312
ALL RIGHT.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.064
SO NOW, UH...

09:26.232 --> 09:29.150
WHERE WAS I WHEN FONZIE HERE
MOVED TO TOWN?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.652
AAY!

09:30.820 --> 09:33.905
GIVE THAT BACKAMUNDO!

09:40.705 --> 09:42.038
ERIC...

09:42.206 --> 09:44.249
ERIC, ARE YOU OKAY?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.667
WH-WHAT?

09:45.835 --> 09:46.876
YEAH.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.170
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE
A STOMACH ACHE OR SOMETHING.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.630
NO.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.341
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY STOMACH.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.219
IT'S JUST THAT...

09:56.387 --> 09:59.347
I... LOVE YOU.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.908
MAN. HA HA!

10:29.629 --> 10:33.089
AND THEN HE PUNCHED ME IN
THE ARM AND SAID, "MAN!"

10:34.050 --> 10:35.508
OH, MY GOD.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.053
WHAT A HORRIBLE DISASTER.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.639
WELL, GO ON!

10:40.806 --> 10:43.350
I GUESS I, LIKE, TOTALLY
SCREWED THINGS UP.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.851
'CAUSE EVER SINCE
I SAID "I LOVE YOU,"

10:45.019 --> 10:47.312
HE'S BEEN ACTING SO WEIRD.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.023
OKAY, WAIT A SECOND.
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.777
WHY DID YOU SAY
"I LOVE YOU"?

10:53.944 --> 10:57.656
BECAUSE I... LOVE HIM?

10:57.823 --> 11:02.869
OHH! DONNA, THAT'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!

11:03.037 --> 11:05.705
YOU ARE WAY TOO YOUNG
TO BE SAYING "I LOVE YOU."

11:05.873 --> 11:08.124
SHUT UP, JACKIE. YOU SAY
IT TO KELSO ALL THE TIME,

11:08.292 --> 11:09.793
AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
YOUNGER THAN ME.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.213
NOT IN LOVE YEARS.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.757
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, ERIC DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE

11:15.925 --> 11:17.175
THAT KIND OF THING.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.135
YOU PROBABLY JUST
SCARED HIM OFF.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.888
ALL YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS
PLAY IT COOL FOR A WHILE,

11:22.056 --> 11:23.890
TURN DOWN THE EMOTIONAL HEAT,

11:24.058 --> 11:26.184
AND, DONNA, GOD
WILLING, HE'LL FORGET

11:26.352 --> 11:30.230
YOU THREW YOURSELF AT HIM.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.065
I KNOW IT SOUNDS
IMPOSSIBLE,

11:32.233 --> 11:35.235
BUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID
ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.736
LOOK, THE SOONER YOU REALIZE
I'M A GENIUS,

11:36.904 --> 11:40.156
THE BETTER OFF
WE'LL BOTH BE.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.205
OH. HI, RED.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.540
SORRY I CAN'T OPEN
THE DOOR,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.667
BUT I DON'T WANT BOB SNEAKING
BACK IN THE HOUSE AGAIN.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.585
OH. THAT'S OKAY.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.963
I JUST CAME BY TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.965
OH, I'M WORKING THROUGH
SOME THINGS.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.259
GOTTEN PAST DENIAL AND I'M
WELL ON MY WAY TO ACCEPTANCE...

11:59.427 --> 12:03.012
YEAH, YEAH. COULDN'T AGREE WITH
YOU MORE. ANYWAY...

12:03.180 --> 12:04.806
TAKE BOB BACK.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.516
RED, I CAN'T DO THAT
RIGHT NOW.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.978
MIDGE, I'VE TALKED TO BOB,
AND HE'S REALLY SORRY.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.438
NOW, BE A SPORT
AND TAKE HIM BACK.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.647
I CAN'T.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.773
TAKE HIM BACK, MIDGE!
NO!

12:13.941 --> 12:16.860
TAKE HIM!

12:19.029 --> 12:22.699
THIS ISN'T OVER, PINCIOTTI!

12:24.702 --> 12:27.120

HEY, KELSO!

12:29.123 --> 12:32.459

12:34.128 --> 12:35.628
WHERE'D IT GO?

12:35.796 --> 12:38.506
PERHAPS IT WENT
UNDER THE COUCH.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.759
JACKIE, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
THIS IS KINDA LAME.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.260
YEAH, SURE.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.928
Er¡c: WAIT! DONNA...

12:44.096 --> 12:46.598
SO WILL I SEE YOU LATER?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.477
NO. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
SEE ME AGAIN.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.314
HA.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.276
SHE'S A LITTLE PISTOL,
HUH?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.862
WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.405
NOTHING!
I DID WHAT YOU SAID.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.240
I TOLD HER I LOVED HER.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.284
YOU'RE LYING.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.535
NO, IT'S TRUE,

13:07.703 --> 13:11.623
EXCEPT...

13:11.791 --> 13:14.459
AND I MIGHT'VE,
YOU KNOW...

13:14.627 --> 13:18.922
POPPED HER ONE ON THE SHOULDER
AND CALLED HER "MAN."

13:19.089 --> 13:20.965
YOU IDIOT.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.509
HEY, THIS ISN'T MY FAULT.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.551
IT'S YOUR FAULT!

13:23.719 --> 13:24.928
YOU SAID IF I TOLD HER
I LOVED HER,

13:25.095 --> 13:26.429
SHE'D SAY IT BACK,
BUT SHE DIDN'T, MAN.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.097
SHE JUST STARED AT ME.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.642
WELL, DID YOU GIVE HER
A CHANCE TO ANSWER?

13:30.810 --> 13:34.646
HOW LONG DID YOU WAIT BEFORE
YOU COMPLETELY MUFFED OUT?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.022
FOREVER, MAN.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.526
LIKE... 5 MINUTES.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.945
YOU'RE LYING!

13:42.112 --> 13:45.240
NO. IT'S TRUE.
IT WAS LIKE...

13:45.407 --> 13:47.116
WELL, MAYBE JUST A
COUPLE SECONDS, BUT I...

13:47.284 --> 13:48.785
TIME CEASED
TO EXIST, OKAY?

13:48.953 --> 13:51.329
I WAS JUST JUST HANGIN' OUT
THERE, REALLY FAR OUT THERE,

13:51.497 --> 13:53.081
JUST...

13:53.249 --> 13:55.625
HANGIN'.

13:55.793 --> 14:02.298
ERIC CONTRIBUTES IN CLASS,
BUT DOES NOT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.679
WHERE THE HECK
IS THAT FUDGSICLE!

14:09.473 --> 14:10.890
HEY...

14:11.058 --> 14:12.475
IS THAT MY FUDGSICLE?

14:12.643 --> 14:16.020
NO. THIS ONE'S MINE.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.944
WHERE'S MY FUDGSICLE?

14:24.905 --> 14:27.490
JUST TELL ME. HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO FIX THIS?

14:27.658 --> 14:29.951
WELL, FIRST OF ALL...

14:30.119 --> 14:31.911
YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO
HANDLE LITTLE WOMAN TROUBLES

14:32.079 --> 14:33.913
WITHOUT GETTING
ALL FREAKED OUT.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.416
IT'S PRETTY UNMANLY,
MAN.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.838
LAURIE.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.841
HA HA HA!

14:47.845 --> 14:50.763
AAAAY!

14:56.520 --> 14:57.896
THAT'S IT!

14:58.063 --> 15:00.648
I HATE THIS STUPID THING!

15:01.275 --> 15:02.817
LAURIE LAUGHING
AT ME.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.485
BUT, KELSO, I THOUGHT WE
WERE SUPPOSED TO HANDLE

15:04.653 --> 15:06.863
OUR WOMAN TROUBLES LIKE A MAN.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.531
YOU SHUT UP.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.950
YOU JUST SHUT UP!

15:11.118 --> 15:12.911
AND IF ANYBODY ELSE HERE
LAUGHS AT ME,

15:13.078 --> 15:17.123
I SWEAR I'M GONNA
KICK SO MUCH ASS!

15:19.168 --> 15:22.545
AND THAT'S MY FUDGSICLE.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.470
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, THAT
JACKET'S THE BEST THING

15:30.638 --> 15:33.473
EVER HAPPENED TO US.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.938
I CAN'T DO IT NOW,
KITTY. HE'S SLEEPING.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.608
BOB!

15:44.610 --> 15:49.155
OH, BOB, YOU'RE AWAKE.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.408
HI.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.410
LET'S SEE.
IT WAS, UH...

15:54.578 --> 15:56.496
IT WAS NO-GO
WITH MIDGE.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.706
SHE DOESN'T
WANNA SEE YOU.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.416
BOY, THAT'S A SHAME, RED.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.168
GUESS IT'S YOU AND ME,
BUDDY.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.128
WELL, THAT'S A PROBLEM.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.922
I LIKE YOU, BOB.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.465
YOU DON'T BORROW
MY THINGS,

16:07.633 --> 16:09.425
YOU KEEP
YOUR LAWN MOWED.

16:09.593 --> 16:13.513
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT...

16:13.681 --> 16:16.599
YOU'RE KIND OF A...

16:16.767 --> 16:19.852
YOU'RE AN ASS.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.692
YEAH?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.443
WELL, IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.112
WE GOTTA STOP
PUSSYFOOTIN' AROUND HERE

16:29.279 --> 16:31.406
AND SOMEHOW GET YOU
BACK IN THAT HOUSE.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.658
HOW?

16:36.954 --> 16:39.956
OH. IT'S YOU.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.207
I'M NOT TAKING HIM
BACK, RED.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.500
NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.170
I'M JUST GONNA TRIM A FEW
OF THESE BRANCHES FOR YOU.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.091
UH, OKAY.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.367
HELP!

17:16.535 --> 17:20.329
MIDGE, I'M TRAPPED UNDER
THIS VERY HEAVY BRANCH!

17:20.998 --> 17:22.540
HELP!

17:22.708 --> 17:24.083
OH, MY GOD! RED!

17:24.251 --> 17:25.668
ARE YOU HURT?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.713
GO, BOB, GO!

17:29.423 --> 17:32.133
OHH!

17:36.388 --> 17:40.016
RED... THAT WAS NOT NICE.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.603
I'M NOT SORRY, MIDGE.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.035
GREAT SHOT.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.038
AND I LOVE YOU.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.083
WELL, THE BASKET DOESN'T REALLY
COUNT BECAUSE I TRAVELED.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.043
YOU COULD NEVER TRAVEL...

18:07.211 --> 18:10.880
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.883
ERIC, YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A HUGE DORK.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.177
A HUGE DORK
WHO LOVES YOU.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.553
GOD!

18:17.721 --> 18:18.971
GOD! STOP IT!

18:19.139 --> 18:22.517
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON I SAID
IT IS BECAUSE I FELT IT

18:22.684 --> 18:25.019
AND NOT JUST SO
YOU'D SAY IT BACK.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.771
AND IF I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA
GET IN SUCH A TWIST ABOUT IT,

18:26.939 --> 18:28.481
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT
AT ALL.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.150
I'M NOT IN A TWIST.
IT'S JUST...

18:31.902 --> 18:33.528
"CAKE." OKAY,
THAT WAS PRETTY STUPID.

18:33.695 --> 18:34.862
YES!

18:35.030 --> 18:36.030
THANK YOU.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.907
SO, I MEAN,
WHY'D YOU SAY IT?

18:38.075 --> 18:41.119
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

18:41.995 --> 18:43.287
NOW...

18:43.455 --> 18:45.706
ONCE IT... lS OUT THERE,

18:45.874 --> 18:48.835
IF WE BROKE UP,
I MEAN...

18:49.002 --> 18:51.504
WHAT WOULD I
TELL MYSELF THEN?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.632
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF
YOU STILL HAVE CAKE.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.427
WE BOTH KNOW HOW MUCH
IT MEANS TO YOU.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.935
THAT'S NICE.
THERE'S A SWEET GIRL.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.814
OKAY, LOOK,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.608
WHY DON'T WE JUST PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED?

19:13.694 --> 19:14.360
I LIKE THAT.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.528
NOW.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.363
OKAY.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.614
NEVER HAPPENED.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.366
OKAY.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.742
AND...

19:21.910 --> 19:24.453
YOU DID TRAVEL,
SO MY BALL.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.915
YES!

19:31.920 --> 19:33.087
HI, YOU TWO.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.422
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANNA KNOW.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.299
MIDGE AND I
WORKED THINGS OUT.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.718
WELL, THAT'S
JUST GREAT, BOB.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.469
YEAH. WE'RE SEPARATING.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.681
YOU CAN'T STAY WITH US.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.267
NO. I'LL BE STAYING AT HOME.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.560
WE'RE GONNA LIVE TOGETHER.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.021
WE'RE JUST GONNA
SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.940
OKAY, BOB, I WANT YOU
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.400
YOU'RE LIVING
IN THE SAME HOUSE,

19:54.568 --> 19:57.111
BUT YOU'RE DATING
OTHER PEOPLE.

19:57.279 --> 20:01.449
I'M NOT SAYING FOR SURE
THERE'LL BE PROBLEMS,

20:01.617 --> 20:04.577
BUT I WANT YOU
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

20:04.745 --> 20:10.333
THINK HARD, BOB.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.960
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE SEXY.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.300
OH, HI.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.719
WHAT A FABULOUS LOOK
FOR YOU.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.348
SERIOUSLY. YOU LOOK LIKE
MARLON BRANDO OR SOMETHING.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.434
OH, MY GOD.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.103
HYDE, WHEN DID YOU GET
SO HOT?

20:31.271 --> 20:32.688
WHAT?

20:32.856 --> 20:34.065
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN HOT.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.567
JACKET JUST
BRINGS IT OUT.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.860
NO!

20:38.028 --> 20:40.488
NO! GIVE IT TO ME!
GIMME BACK MY JACKET!

20:41.406 --> 20:42.615
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.576
GET OFF ME, YOU LOAD!

20:47.829 --> 20:50.081
SO, THEY'RE REALLY
GONNA SEPARATE?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.708
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE STILL
GONNA LIVE TOGETHER.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.293
OH.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.962
WOW.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.630

21:00.676 --> 21:01.926
I'VE EVER HEARD.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.886
I MEAN, HOW'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO WORK?

21:04.054 --> 21:05.721
WELL, I IMAGINE IT'LL
BE LIKE WHEN GILLIGAN

21:05.889 --> 21:07.139
AND THE SKIPPER HAD A FIGHT

21:07.307 --> 21:08.557
AND THEY DREW A CHALK LINE
DOWN THE CENTER OF THEIR HUT.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.393
THAT WORKED OUT GREAT.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.477
YEAH. THAT SOLVED
ALL THEIR PROBLEMS.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.980
YEAH.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.067
I LOVE YOU.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.861
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

21:26.576 --> 21:30.955
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
CARSEY-WERNER PRODUCTIONS

YES, I AM.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.814
NO. IT'S JUST
TOO HORRIBLE.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.108
I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT, KITTY.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.860
THANK YOU, HONEY.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.529
