00:01.335 --> 00:03.602
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
She knows.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.637
LEEZA:
<i> Charles isn't at a monastery</i>
<i> in Reims, is he?</i>

00:05.639 --> 00:08.307
The king of France
has gone missing.

00:08.309 --> 00:11.477
What did you say
your name was?
Nicole.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.312
If you could convince Charles to
return with us as king, then,

00:13.314 --> 00:15.047
we'd happily
bring you along.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.515
How dare you threaten my country

00:16.517 --> 00:19.485
or my reign. You have
no power over me.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.386
I am a Protestant.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.021
He's a heretic?!

00:22.023 --> 00:24.189
I know this isn't what
you wanted, but for now,

00:24.191 --> 00:26.091
<i>this marriage will protect you.</i>

00:26.093 --> 00:27.326
I can't stay here.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.362
I feel a poison
in my heart.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.697
If you're looking
for Lord Bothwell,

00:31.699 --> 00:33.499
you'll find him
in that tavern.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.801
I need you to give my brother
James access to your port.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.336
I don't<i> give</i> anyone anything.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.505
I'm a businessman.
The Crown

00:39.507 --> 00:42.541
is willing to pay five percent
of the trade profits.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.376
Make it 25%.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.545
That's more than fair.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.514
Fine.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.215
Do we have a deal?

00:50.217 --> 00:52.351
Now that I think about it, no.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.820
Keira, you love me
for who I really am.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.222
Another warning
from the Loyal Watchman.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.557
Every time he writes,
he speaks the truth.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.526
Don't bother trying to deny
you're having an affair.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.829
If I do marry you, it'll be
for the good of Scotland

01:03.831 --> 01:07.166
and the promise of England
and nothing more.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.439
You're late.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.441
You're lucky they
aren't here yet.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.842
I apologize.
Wouldn't want to miss

01:16.844 --> 01:18.510
greeting your Medici guests.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.145
They are<i> our</i> Medici guests,

01:20.147 --> 01:23.816
and we must present a strong
and united front for them.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.517
I'm here now.
It's not just about now.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.187
Over the coming week,
guests will be arriving

01:28.189 --> 01:31.290
from across the continent to
witness our Catholic wedding,

01:31.292 --> 01:33.625
and few are as important
as Lucrezia de Medici.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.295
She lends legitimacy
and strength

01:36.297 --> 01:38.197
both to my Scottish rule

01:38.199 --> 01:40.532
and our joint claims
to the English throne.

01:40.534 --> 01:44.169
And there it is-- the one reason
you're still keeping me around.
Yes.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.305
Don't make me regret
my decision.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.473
In fact, if you have any other

01:47.475 --> 01:50.142
affairs or secrets
to spring on me,

01:50.144 --> 01:51.510
you'd best get them
out of the way now.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.479
I know I made a mistake
with Keira.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.849
She's in the past. You are
all that matters to me now.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.484
MAN:
There's my favorite
hell-raiser!

01:58.486 --> 02:00.552
Darnley, you handsome bastard.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.155
Hey.
Malcolm!
Um, excuse me.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.290
He's an old friend.
You've arrived.

02:05.292 --> 02:09.461
You made it!
Should have known it would
take a crown to nail you down.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.563
Your Grace.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.333
The Duchess of Florence
and her family have arrived.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.470
Lady Lucrezia,
thank you so much

02:18.472 --> 02:19.605
for traveling such
a great distance.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.240
No distance is too great

02:21.242 --> 02:23.475
to honor the widow
of our dear cousin,

02:23.477 --> 02:25.477
Francis de Valois.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.147
MALCOLM: The queen was in a
childless marriage before.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.816
Are you certain the
goods aren't damaged?

02:30.818 --> 02:33.619
A barren wife is about as
much use as soggy firewood.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.889
Careful. That's my future wife
you speak of.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.158
(laughs)
But to your point,
it is said

02:39.160 --> 02:42.327
that Francis was a frail dwarf
with undescended testicles.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.563
(chuckling)
LUCREZIA:
How dare you!

02:46.767 --> 02:48.734
Duchess, I didn't, um...
LUCREZIA:
Francis was a wonderful

02:48.736 --> 02:51.603
king we Medicis are
proud to be related to.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.540
If this is the behavior
we're to be subjected to

02:54.542 --> 02:59.211
at this wedding, we will be
taking our leave... immediately.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.580

03:02.683 --> 03:05.250
MARY:
You have

03:05.252 --> 03:07.519
no idea what you've done.

03:07.521 --> 03:12.624

NARCISSE: She's good.
What we failed to do

03:28.943 --> 03:31.910
in months, Nicole has achieved
practically overnight.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.546
CATHERINE: She has Charles
regaining favor

03:34.548 --> 03:36.582
with the Catholic nobles.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.783
Precisely as we directed her.

these three men for their valor

03:41.488 --> 03:43.622
and loyalty
to their crown and country.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.657
Lord Dechamps,
you've been deemed worthy

03:45.659 --> 03:46.858
of the accolade of knighthood.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.327
(metallic scrape of sword)

03:51.899 --> 03:53.732
CATHERINE:
Did you sleep with her?

03:53.734 --> 03:57.436
I didn't have to. I paid
for her influence over Charles.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.937
And it wasn't cheap.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.809
Have you any news from
your impetuous daughter,

04:03.811 --> 04:05.410
the queen of Spain?

04:05.412 --> 04:07.479
Well, she's back
in Spain, thank God.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.680
But she's not happy.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.649
I informed her
Prince Henry's

04:10.651 --> 04:11.850
return to France
has been delayed.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.485
'Cause he is fighting Turks

04:13.487 --> 04:14.653
on behalf of the Catholic faith.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.321
I thought
that should please her.

04:16.323 --> 04:17.723
Well, yes,
she likes

04:17.725 --> 04:19.391
the slaughter of infidels,

04:19.393 --> 04:21.660
but she wants Henry
on the throne,

04:21.662 --> 04:23.262
not his older brother.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.863
Leeza will allow Charles

04:24.865 --> 04:27.699
to remain king
while Henry's delayed.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.568
And in the meantime,
she's requesting

04:29.570 --> 04:31.670
that I attend Mary's wedding.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.605
She insists that
I represent

04:33.607 --> 04:36.642
both France and Spain's support
of a Catholic union.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.510
Meanwhile,
back at home,

04:38.512 --> 04:40.979
every moment
Charles remains Protestant,

04:40.981 --> 04:43.715
we run the risk
of his conversion getting out.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.851
CATHERINE: Inciting civil war,
which is why

04:45.853 --> 04:49.855
Charles must give up
this flight of fancy.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.457
Especially with Henry
on his way.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.026
Oh, Nicole's
power of persuasion

04:54.028 --> 04:55.861
better be all she promised.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.697
Charles must reembrace

04:58.699 --> 05:00.799
Catholicism and soon.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.801
DARNLEY:
<i> I was defending you</i>

05:02.803 --> 05:04.770
against rumors of barrenness.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.305
Is it not better that the blame

05:06.307 --> 05:09.007
be placed on Francis
rather than you?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.709
Defending me
does us no good

05:10.711 --> 05:12.844
if it loses us
our Medici support.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.514
And attacks Francis,
a man I loved

05:15.516 --> 05:19.017
The Medici family has toiled
for generations to rise

05:19.019 --> 05:21.353
from the merchant classes.
They take great pride

05:21.355 --> 05:22.754
in their connection to
the French royal family,

05:22.756 --> 05:23.989
and your insult

05:23.991 --> 05:25.957
undermined their very status.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.660
I will apologize
to the duchess and...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.729
Do you think an apology
is going to fix this?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.831
The duchess has already booked
passage back to Florence.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.533
Her ship leaves
the day after next.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.534
Then let her go.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.103
Good riddance.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.739
If the duchess goes,
she takes her support

05:40.741 --> 05:43.041
and the promise
of funding with her.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.943
All right, then we will find out
what it takes

05:44.945 --> 05:46.678
to convince her to stay.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.580
I've already taken care of that,
she wants lands

05:48.582 --> 05:49.681

Lord Theodore Davies.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.483
Oh, that's it?

05:51.485 --> 05:52.984
And for what purpose?
Not only are the lands

05:52.986 --> 05:55.020
quite valuable,
but they come with a title.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.655
The Earldom of Menteith.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.758
And only with this exchange is
she willing to continue

05:59.760 --> 06:01.059
supporting my rule.

no more time to waste on this.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.123
Or you.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.194
GUARD:
<i> We found him, Your Majesty.</i>

09:24.731 --> 09:27.165
ELIZABETH:
John Hawkins, the man Spain

09:27.167 --> 09:29.167
is determined I imprison.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.903
Your Majesty, I'm just
a well-meaning privateer.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.905
I've done nothing
against you or England.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.041
Perhaps not,
but you've been accused

09:36.043 --> 09:39.144
of stealing Spanish treasure
valued at

09:39.146 --> 09:42.347
10,000 pounds while at sea
in the new world.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.983
That makes you a thief.
And a pirate.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.052
I prefer the term "explorer."

09:47.054 --> 09:48.153
But officially my title

09:48.155 --> 09:49.187
is Captain Hawkins.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.855
Give me one reason,

09:50.857 --> 09:52.924
Captain Hawkins,
why I shouldn't comply

09:52.926 --> 09:55.193
with Spain's request
and throw you in the Tower?

09:57.230 --> 10:00.365
My voyage to New Spain
was not about theft,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.100
but about discovery.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.135
If you'll allow me...

10:08.208 --> 10:11.343
A fruit from the New World.

10:11.345 --> 10:14.245
It's called a tomato.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.914
This is a fruit?

10:15.916 --> 10:18.083
Some say vegetable...
standing argument.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.218
Let me make my case
to you that I am more

10:20.220 --> 10:21.853
than just a thief.
Send the guards back

10:21.855 --> 10:24.723
to retrieve my other
treasures from the New World,

10:24.725 --> 10:27.292
and I will show you all the
wonders they have to offer.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.630
You've just earned yourself
a dinner with the queen.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.366
We'll see then
if your discoveries

10:34.368 --> 10:37.002
are worth defying Spain.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.306
Claude.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.044
It's been weeks
since our wedding.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.213
I'm glad you're
keeping count.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.415
People are starting to notice

10:50.417 --> 10:52.917
that we are still living
in separate quarters.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.220
I understand that
you needed some time,

10:55.222 --> 10:58.056
but you can't keep
avoiding me forever.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.725
We're talking now,
aren't we?

11:00.727 --> 11:02.861
(horses neigh in distance)

11:03.997 --> 11:06.164
Claude...

11:06.166 --> 11:08.833
I am sorry for what
happened, truly.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.737
But now that
Leith is gone...

11:12.739 --> 11:15.040
where does that leave us?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.975
We are wed...
And the deal was

11:16.977 --> 11:19.711
I would give you heirs if
you would let me have Leith.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.146
But I cannot have him anymore.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.848
Yet he still has your heart.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.850
Claude, I am not
pressing for heirs.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.352
I'm simply here
to remind you

11:27.354 --> 11:29.354
that I promised you a
lifetime of happiness.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.322
That is a promise
I intend to honor.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.391
It feels like everything's
crumbling around me.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.193
I'm worried about Charles,
my mother

11:35.195 --> 11:37.162
has sent for Henry,
which can only mean one thing.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.031
With Charles's instability

11:40.033 --> 11:41.866
and his new religion,

11:41.868 --> 11:44.335
she believes he won't last
on the throne.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.171
Well, she sent for the next
in line to replace him.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.906
That's a good thing, isn't it?

11:47.908 --> 11:50.475
Charles will finally be free
of the pressures of being king.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.010
You don't understand.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.411
Even if Charles willingly

11:53.413 --> 11:55.213
abdicates,
people will still say

11:55.215 --> 11:56.347
that he's the rightful king.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.183
And the faction
that supports Henry

11:58.185 --> 12:00.351
will never allow Charles
to live,

12:00.353 --> 12:01.853
to be a threat.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.355
Luc, this could not only

12:04.357 --> 12:06.257
be my brother's downfall,

12:06.259 --> 12:08.193
but his death.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.002
A castle you can eat.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.804
Painted food.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.040
Isn't it extraordinary?
(giggling)

12:22.042 --> 12:23.808
I see life at court suits you.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.244
And not just the cake
you had commissioned.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.313
My family greatly benefited

12:28.315 --> 12:31.116
from your generosity
after our last arrangement.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.851
I was hoping
I could make

12:32.853 --> 12:36.154
their lives more...
permanently comfortable.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.157
I had a similar thought.
Hmm.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.392
There's a lovely manor house,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.795
just outside of Meaux.

12:43.797 --> 12:47.232
It would make a perfect home.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.368
And how would I earn that?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.303
Undo whatever it is you
and your family did

12:52.305 --> 12:53.872
to turn Charles Protestant.

12:53.874 --> 12:57.442
Convince him to come back
to his Catholic faith.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.311
Charles came to that decision
on his own.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.381
I don't know why or how.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.284
There was no talk of faith
or conversion?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.920
My relationship with Charles

13:08.922 --> 13:11.289
earned me his ear.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.258
But his conversion was
something else.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.160
He found a comfort

13:15.162 --> 13:17.529
and a peace in the simplicity
of our lives.

13:17.531 --> 13:18.963
Interesting.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.799
Well, be that as it may,

13:20.801 --> 13:22.834
if you want to stay here,

13:22.836 --> 13:24.269
you will use every

13:24.271 --> 13:27.071
resource you have
to convert him back.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.273
Because if you don't,

13:28.275 --> 13:30.542
Charles will lose
more than just

13:30.544 --> 13:33.011
his religious freedom.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.014
He will lose everything!

13:36.016 --> 13:39.017
And where would that leave you?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.321
(thunder rumbling)

13:43.323 --> 13:44.856
BOTHWELL:
<i> It's beautiful, isn't it?</i>

13:44.858 --> 13:46.457
<i> Best time of year</i>
<i> to visit the region.</i>

13:46.459 --> 13:48.259
<i> Although, the weather...</i>

13:48.261 --> 13:50.328
can be a little unpredictable.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.363
(chuckles softly)

13:54.000 --> 13:56.267
Where exactly are
you taking me?

13:56.269 --> 13:57.468
There's a good vantage point
about a mile from here.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.137
Don't worry,

13:59.139 --> 14:01.339
I'll have you back
before the storm arrives.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.907
I don't have time to play
your games, Lord Bothwell.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.209
Oh, this isn't a game.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.077
Not while you and your rule
are at stake.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.846
<i> Just wanted a moment</i>
<i> of your time,</i>

14:07.848 --> 14:09.480
<i> away from the eyes and ears</i>
<i> of court.</i>

14:09.482 --> 14:11.282
Well, you give me
little choice.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.084
What is it you wanted to say?

14:13.086 --> 14:16.187
Darnley will be your undoing.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.225
<i> Lord</i> Darnley will be my
husband and your king.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.259
Yeah, but should he be?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.261
A man who deceives you

14:23.263 --> 14:24.529
in order to give himself
an advantage,

14:24.531 --> 14:27.432
whose arrogance causes him
to act without thinking,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.968
who speaks out of turn
to you and those who you love.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.903
How do you know all this?

14:31.905 --> 14:34.305
Whispers travel
like wildfire around here.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.041
Especially those pertaining
to you and your Lord Darnley.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.377
There will be whispers
no matter who I marry.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.612
Darnley is not the asset

14:40.614 --> 14:42.146
you imagine him to be.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.348
(thunder rumbling)
If you marry him,

14:43.350 --> 14:44.949
you'll spend the rest
of your life

14:44.951 --> 14:47.085
trying to rectify the damage
that he causes.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.420
What you actually need
is a partner,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.522
by your side.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.259
This marriage will
not be one of love.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.593
But it will get me England

14:55.595 --> 14:58.396
and that alone makes Darnley
worth the sacrifices,

14:58.398 --> 14:59.898
not the least of which

14:59.900 --> 15:02.300
is spending the afternoon
trapped in a boat

15:02.302 --> 15:03.434
with a tavern gambler.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.303
(chuckling)

15:09.409 --> 15:10.508
Flash flood.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.609
Quick, get to the bank!

15:11.611 --> 15:13.544
(grunts)

15:13.546 --> 15:14.479
Come on!

15:14.481 --> 15:16.281
(both grunting)

15:21.421 --> 15:23.554
(grunts)

15:23.556 --> 15:24.555
The boat is gone.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.325
Brilliant.
Now we're stranded.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.433
(giggling)

15:35.435 --> 15:40.104
(chuckling)

15:40.106 --> 15:41.306
Being Catholic,
I grew up thinking

15:41.308 --> 15:42.473
sex wasn't for pleasure.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.175
But you...

15:44.177 --> 15:45.310
have taught me otherwise.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.245
(giggles)

15:48.248 --> 15:49.614
Charles?

15:49.616 --> 15:50.982
Hmm?

15:50.983 --> 15:52.349
Is that why you
became Protestant?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.419
What?
To get away from

15:54.421 --> 15:56.321
all the guilt of sex?
All the rules?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.122
I don't want to talk about this.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.090
It's just...

16:00.593 --> 16:02.627
now that I've
seen your life,

16:02.629 --> 16:04.595
here at court,
I can't help but wonder,

16:04.597 --> 16:06.230
wouldn't it be easier,

16:06.232 --> 16:08.199
better even,

16:08.201 --> 16:09.701
if you were Catholic?

16:09.703 --> 16:12.270
All these pleasures would
still be at your disposal.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.671
There's no use
wondering about that.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.506
I'm Protestant now.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.509
But your most loyal
and powerful subjects are not.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.079
France is at peace now,
but not that long ago,

16:21.081 --> 16:24.615
Protestants-- regular, kind
people like my family and I--

16:24.617 --> 16:26.217
were being persecuted.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.685
If they heard their king

16:27.687 --> 16:29.287
now shared their faith,

16:29.289 --> 16:31.689
war would break out
and all their blood

16:31.691 --> 16:33.358
would be on your hands.

16:36.997 --> 16:37.662
These aren't your words.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.328
Has my mother been
speaking to you,

16:38.331 --> 16:39.330
or has Narcisse?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.399
Charles...

16:42.335 --> 16:43.234
they have a good point.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.003
And they want to help.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.771
If you would simply

16:46.773 --> 16:49.173
say you're Catholic,
even if you're not at heart,

16:50.243 --> 16:53.344
you could prevent
all of that.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.579
No.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.347
I know you think
you're helping me.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.350
But I'm Protestant now.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.019
Turning my back
on that would mean

17:01.021 --> 17:03.254
relinquishing myself
to the darkness

17:03.256 --> 17:05.056
that nearly destroyed me.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.290
(sighs softly)

17:06.292 --> 17:09.460
You of all people
should understand that.

17:09.462 --> 17:13.031
BOTHWELL: You know, that'll dry
much faster if you remove it.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.333
You are wearing a petticoat,
aren't you?

17:15.335 --> 17:18.503
I can't take it off;
it took two servants

17:18.505 --> 17:20.471
to put it on.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.341
Let me guess.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.410
You'd rather soak there
in misery than ask for my help.

to the estates

18:14.761 --> 18:16.294
to her by nightfall.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.196
Once we dry off a bit,

18:18.198 --> 18:19.464
I'll need your help getting back

18:19.466 --> 18:20.598
the fastest way possible.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.100
There's no use to go back.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.303
They can't get the deed tonight.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.671
It's being kept by a merchant,

18:26.673 --> 18:29.373
at least a day's ride from here.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.343
When I arrived this morning,

18:32.345 --> 18:35.313
you didn't show me
around your lavish new home.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.381
In fact,

18:37.383 --> 18:40.685
you seemed quite anxious
to get me away from the estate

18:40.687 --> 18:42.153
and onto that boat.

18:42.155 --> 18:45.189
Now I am asking
you for your help

18:45.191 --> 18:46.457
in this urgent matter,
and suddenly

18:46.459 --> 18:47.725
the deed is elsewhere?

18:49.195 --> 18:50.394
These aren't really your lands,

18:50.396 --> 18:52.413
are they, Bothwell?

18:52.414 --> 18:54.431
I needed some time
alone with you

18:54.434 --> 18:56.901
to convince you to call off
this disastrous marriage.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.402
(sighs deeply)

18:58.404 --> 19:00.571
I should have known.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.707
You are a liar and a scoundrel!

19:02.709 --> 19:03.708
Mary, wait.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.444
You knew what Darnley had done.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.778
You knew I was coming
to see Lord Davies and

19:07.780 --> 19:09.964
you were waiting for me!

19:09.965 --> 19:12.149
You deceived me into
wasting an entire day

19:12.152 --> 19:14.318
while my country suffers.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.255
Is the future of Scotland
a joke to you, Bothwell?

19:17.257 --> 19:18.422
The future of Scotland

19:18.424 --> 19:20.725
is everything to me.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.493
I was trying to
protect you, Mary.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.462
I am not yours to protect!

19:24.464 --> 19:26.164
Yes, you are.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.165
(sighs)

19:27.167 --> 19:28.166
I promised your mother

19:28.168 --> 19:29.600
that I'd watch over you.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.335
That when you return
to Scotland,

19:31.337 --> 19:32.570
I would defend you
and your throne

19:32.572 --> 19:34.639
from any threat,
and I've kept that promise.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.207
I've kept you safe

19:36.209 --> 19:37.475
and aware of
Darnley's true nature

19:37.477 --> 19:38.609
at every turn.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.478
You've been watching over me?

19:40.480 --> 19:41.913
And warning me about...

19:41.915 --> 19:44.515
Darnley?
You've known?

19:46.920 --> 19:49.520
You're my Loyal Watchman.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.389
Yes.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.590
I am.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.227
There are monstrous fish,

19:56.229 --> 19:57.495
scaled like a serpent,

19:57.497 --> 19:59.530
but with short legs,
they can crawl onto dry land.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.965
I've seen them with my own eyes.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.633
And birds of every color.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.669
Imagine parrots
the size of ravens.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.537
(chuckling):
How marvelous.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.206
I brought something back
called a turkey.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.540
Ugly bird, to be sure,
but quite delicious.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.942
Ah, yes.

20:10.944 --> 20:14.445
My guards warned me
of the large, angry chicken.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.547
They've deemed it unsafe.
(laughs)

20:16.549 --> 20:18.382
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:18.384 --> 20:20.351
welcome to the Great Court
of Elizabeth I,

20:20.353 --> 20:22.486
where fruit and land fowl
strike fear into the hearts

20:22.488 --> 20:24.589
of men and queens.
Captain Hawkins,

20:24.591 --> 20:28.559
you are here by my grace only.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.661
I will not have you
question the rules.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.597
You will abide by them.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.631
(quietly):
That's bloody boring.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.001
Do you have something to add?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.569
Yes.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.004
That sounds bloody boring.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.406
Leave us.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.643
I can see how you
incurred Spain's

20:45.645 --> 20:47.578
displeasure, Hawkins.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.881
You could use a lesson
in manners.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.516
But I admit

20:52.518 --> 20:54.986
you do make for good company.

20:54.988 --> 20:55.987
What's that?

20:55.989 --> 20:57.688
Distilled wormwood.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.992
Not so boring after all.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.663
ELIZABETH:
<i> Did you just shush me?</i>

21:05.665 --> 21:07.365
HAWKINS:
<i> I don't know.</i>

21:07.367 --> 21:08.766
Did I?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.301
ELIZABETH:
Damn! That was supposed

21:10.303 --> 21:11.802
to go in.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.604
Ah! Once again,

21:13.606 --> 21:15.640
the great Hawkins defeats
the enemy gourd.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.341
We're out.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.744
I win.
Oh, go and fetch
your precious metals,

21:19.746 --> 21:21.445
and I'll change that.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.847
They belong to the Crown now.
They belong

21:22.849 --> 21:25.616
to Spain.
(chuckles)

21:25.618 --> 21:27.652
And they will be returned.
Why?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.787
Spain simply took that gold
from a land they'd happened

21:29.789 --> 21:32.690
to sail to first-- it could
just as easily have been yours.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.725
That and so much more,
Your Majesty.
Enough.

21:36.029 --> 21:38.596
What really happened
in New Spain

21:38.598 --> 21:40.998
between you and the Spanish?

21:43.503 --> 21:45.469
(sighs)

21:45.471 --> 21:47.805
We were forced to seek port
in San Juan

21:47.807 --> 21:49.807
after a storm
had battered our ships.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.676
The Spaniards there
agreed to allow us

21:51.678 --> 21:53.611
to make repairs in peace,
but we soon learned

21:53.613 --> 21:55.713
that a Spaniard's word
is worth dirt.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.847
They attacked us.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.683
I barely escaped
with my life.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.551
The others were not so lucky.

22:00.553 --> 22:01.552
That's awful.

22:01.554 --> 22:02.987
The gold they stole
from Spain

22:02.989 --> 22:05.589
is nothing compared
to what they did to us.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.692
As you said,
Spain has claimed the New World,

22:07.694 --> 22:09.894
and they won't let anyone else
profit from it.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.663
But why only them?
Their power derives

22:12.665 --> 22:14.432
from the riches
of those lands.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.467
There's no reason
that we can't do the same.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.903
No reason England cannot
rival Spain.

22:18.905 --> 22:23.507
That's a grand idea,
but it's not possible.

22:23.509 --> 22:27.411
Spain is the most
powerful nation in Europe,

22:27.413 --> 22:30.915
and England is small,
surrounded by Catholic enemies.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.584
I have enough
to deal with here

22:33.586 --> 22:36.420
on this continent.

22:36.422 --> 22:39.056
I can't afford to challenge
Spain on another.

22:39.058 --> 22:42.960
No, they will get
their treasure back.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.695
And what happens to me?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.430
I'll make up some excuse

22:46.432 --> 22:48.699
about your release this time.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.368
But if it happens again,

22:50.370 --> 22:52.670
I'll have no choice
but to imprison you.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.673
Just as I was starting to think
you shared my vision

22:55.675 --> 22:58.709
of an England whose greatness
reaches beyond this continent.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.813
The world is bigger
than Europe, Your Majesty.

23:14.894 --> 23:18.062
I wondered if you might
have a moment, Your Majesty?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.964
Does it require
my signature?

23:19.966 --> 23:21.632
(chuckles):
It does not.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.534
I only wish
to discuss a matter

23:23.536 --> 23:24.802
of great importance to me.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.003
Uh, perhaps
we can go outside

23:26.005 --> 23:27.438
for a bit of archery.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.607
It appears you can use
some fresh air.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.610
So they've gotten
to you as well.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.712
Who?

23:34.714 --> 23:37.014
Lord Narcisse,
your father,

23:37.016 --> 23:38.983
and my mother.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.985
They've sent you to
offer counsel on my health,

23:40.987 --> 23:43.154
my religious beliefs.

23:43.156 --> 23:46.624
Actually, I came to ask
for<i> your</i> counsel.

23:49.962 --> 23:55.499
Your sister Claude,
though we are wed,

23:55.501 --> 23:57.968
the truth is I don't
know her at all.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.105
I'd like to, but she
doesn't make that easy.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.973
I'm hardly one
to give marriage advice.
No, perhaps not.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.208
But you do know Claude.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.710
I-I want to learn
what she enjoys.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.145
Something we might
share together.

24:11.017 --> 24:14.151
(chuckles):
She loves the stars.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.823
When we were children, she used
to gaze at them for hours,

24:18.825 --> 24:20.090
deep into the night.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.126
She told me once that
no matter what happened,

24:22.128 --> 24:23.961
no matter where
we found ourselves,

24:23.963 --> 24:27.198
the stars would
remain constant.

24:27.200 --> 24:31.035
Always there to give us
direction and comfort.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.237
Does that help?

24:33.239 --> 24:35.840
Very much. Thank you.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.577
Well, I'll let you get
back to work.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.647
Wait. Actually,

24:43.649 --> 24:45.916
I do think I might like
some fresh air.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.819
Magnificent shot.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.955
Francis was
an excellent teacher.

24:50.957 --> 24:53.090
Who taught you?
Was it your father?

24:53.092 --> 24:55.125
(chuckles):
No.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.127
He wasn't around much
when I was learning archery

24:57.129 --> 24:59.997
or anything else.

24:59.999 --> 25:04.068
Too busy giving advice
here at court?

25:04.070 --> 25:06.904
You mentioned that
he and your mother

25:06.906 --> 25:08.005
had been pressuring you?

25:09.976 --> 25:12.109
They think I've made
a horrible mistake

25:12.111 --> 25:14.111
by becoming Protestant.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.913
What is it about
the Protestant teachings

25:15.915 --> 25:18.048
that appeals to you?

25:18.050 --> 25:19.583
It isn't so much
the teachings.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.752
It's that, as a Protestant,
I'm free to make choices

25:21.754 --> 25:23.954
without the Pope telling me
what is right and wrong.

25:23.956 --> 25:26.123
I'm free to rule
on my own terms

25:26.125 --> 25:29.727
without all that...
pressure and oversight.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.229
And you don't believe
that Protestant leaders

25:32.231 --> 25:33.964
will exert the same pressure

25:33.966 --> 25:35.533
once they learn
you share their faith?

25:35.535 --> 25:37.902
Protestant or Catholic,
these are people.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.271
People with self-serving
interests,

25:40.273 --> 25:41.906
agendas, and demands.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.574
I'm afraid you've
simply exchanged

25:43.576 --> 25:45.109
one source of pressure
for another.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.782
How do I escape it?

25:51.784 --> 25:54.618
Well, as king you will
always feel pressure.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.920
But you are not alone.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.221
Lean on those
who care for you

25:57.223 --> 25:59.790
and know your heart
best-- your family.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.159
I promise, you will find
strength and wisdom there.

26:07.133 --> 26:10.167
Are you sure this is the way
to Lord Davies' home?

26:10.169 --> 26:12.136
You still don't
trust me?

26:12.138 --> 26:13.671
Nothing engenders
trust more

26:13.673 --> 26:16.206
than a man who uses
lies and misdirection

26:16.208 --> 26:17.675
to further his agenda.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.810
My agenda is
to keep you safe.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.146
Despite my objections
to your marriage,

26:22.148 --> 26:25.316
I may need the duchess' support
in order to protect your throne,

26:25.318 --> 26:27.217
so if you've promised
her these lands,

26:27.219 --> 26:28.852
I shall help you
deliver them.

26:28.854 --> 26:31.221
You have my word.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.057
Why the Loyal Watchman?

26:33.059 --> 26:35.192
Why not just sign your
true name to your messages?

26:35.194 --> 26:37.995
I made a lot of enemies
working for Marie de Guise.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.897
She was a Catholic,
after all.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.600
And when your mother died
and James assumed the regency,

26:42.602 --> 26:44.134
well, he made sure
to erase any trace

26:44.136 --> 26:45.736
of her Catholic regime.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.771
I've been unwelcome at court
ever since.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.106
My brother was in
a very difficult pos...

26:49.108 --> 26:50.207
He's a political animal

26:50.209 --> 26:51.709
with very little regard
for me.

26:51.711 --> 26:52.943
And if I'd signed my name,
he would have advised you

26:52.945 --> 26:54.144
to ignore my warnings
completely.

26:54.146 --> 26:57.615
I had to reach you another way.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.118
(sighs)

27:01.120 --> 27:03.120
Is something the matter,
Bothwell?

27:03.122 --> 27:06.824
Strange. Your mother spoke
of you so often...

27:06.826 --> 27:09.994
your courage, your beauty,
and your wit.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.329
I felt like I knew you
before you'd even arrived.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.632
(branch snaps)

27:14.634 --> 27:16.800
Hold, sir!
State your business.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.168
Mary.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.336
Do you know him?

27:19.338 --> 27:21.972
I've never
seen him before.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.841
I have a message for you
before you wed.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.009
Before I wed?

27:25.011 --> 27:26.810
Not a step closer, sir.

27:26.812 --> 27:30.114
No, let him finish.
Tell me.

27:30.116 --> 27:34.218
You will have love
or an heir, but not both.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.687
If you choose a child,
it will be a son,

27:36.689 --> 27:38.322
and he will rule
both nations.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.190
England and Scotland,

27:40.192 --> 27:42.159
united at last,
and in peace.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.894
This is your fate.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.963
It is a choice,
once made,

27:45.965 --> 27:48.732
that is immutable.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.074
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I never dreamed

27:57.076 --> 27:58.242
that the queen of Scots
would be bringing<i> me</i> water.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.044
I've instructed
Lord Bothwell

28:00.046 --> 28:01.779
to get my guards to help
get you back to court

28:01.781 --> 28:02.913
to see the physician.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.882
How did you get here,
Mr. Rizzio?

28:04.884 --> 28:05.983
Please, call me David.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.451
I'm a merchant
from Turin.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.286
Came with the prospect
of business.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.954
I had an accident
on the road,

28:10.956 --> 28:13.223
and I was thrown
by my horse.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.192
I hit my head,
and when I woke,

28:15.194 --> 28:17.728
I was in the company
of Druids.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.331
The Druid who
rescued me told me

28:21.333 --> 28:23.200
that he had an urgent
message for Mary.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.869
Not "the queen"
or "Her Majesty,"

28:25.871 --> 28:29.139
but... Mary.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.009
Like a friend
would speak of you.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.377
Did this man
give you his name?

28:33.379 --> 28:38.015
No, but I remember
his face.

28:38.017 --> 28:41.218
Dark hair,
bright eyes,

28:41.220 --> 28:43.187
like sea glass.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.322
He told me that he'd
promised you something.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.257
A promise?
Yes.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.426
That he would come to you
when you needed him the most.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.329
Sebastian.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.732
Did my friend
tell you why

28:54.734 --> 28:56.300
he couldn't deliver
this message himself?

28:56.302 --> 28:59.069
He did.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.471
Or at least
his spirit did.

29:00.473 --> 29:03.073
When I parted ways
with the Druid,

29:03.075 --> 29:04.508
his spirit continued
to guide me to ensure

29:04.510 --> 29:06.410
that I delivered
those words to you.

29:06.412 --> 29:10.080
I must confess, the journey is
very muddled in my mind.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.448
Why do you say
"his spirit"?

29:11.450 --> 29:14.485
Is he in peril? Did he foresee
some danger in his future?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.154
I don't know.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.027
Your Grace, the Spanish
ambassador, Lord Renaude,

29:24.029 --> 29:26.363
is demanding an
audience with you.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.298
Why has John Hawkins
not yet been arrested?

29:28.300 --> 29:31.135
We received word
he was brought to you,

29:31.137 --> 29:33.303
only to be released again.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.939
King Philip will not allow
the theft of Spanish treasure

29:35.941 --> 29:37.374
to go unpunished.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.376
Of course not.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.812
Hawkins has been
reprimanded,

29:41.814 --> 29:43.447
and your gold recovered.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.183
Spain will be repaid
in full for her losses.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.519
Reprimanded? Spain
could hold England

29:48.521 --> 29:50.154
wholly responsible

29:50.156 --> 29:52.189
and consider this
an act of aggression.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.993
I understand.

29:55.995 --> 30:00.063
He will be arrested
and imprisoned at once.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.399
Do not let this
happen again.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.369
Your navy is no match
for our Spanish fleet.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.971
And to the north,
your Scottish cousin,

30:07.973 --> 30:09.473
already allied
with France,

30:09.475 --> 30:11.542
marries with full
Vatican support,

30:11.544 --> 30:14.845
with Catholic might
surrounding you by land and sea,

30:14.847 --> 30:17.881
leaving England
a diminished power.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.316
A fact you would
do well to remember,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.285
Your Majesty.

30:23.489 --> 30:28.492
My apologies to King Philip
for this egregious mistake.

30:28.494 --> 30:33.430
I'm afraid I haven't been
seeing things clearly.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.601
But I will rectify the matter.

30:42.575 --> 30:46.176
Please tell me why you would
give serious consideration

30:46.178 --> 30:49.546
to a prophecy spoken by
a vagrant in the woods?

30:49.548 --> 30:51.181
Rizzio is not a vagrant.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.852
He is a merchant, and he is
recovering in the infirmary.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.954
And he wasn't speaking
as himself.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.389
I think he was giving me
a message from Bash.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.959
He joined the Druids to
learn the gift of foresight.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.527
And you've known others
with this "gift"?

31:03.529 --> 31:05.562
You believe in it?

31:05.564 --> 31:07.331
I have seen what can happen
if their words

31:07.333 --> 31:09.299
are ignored.
You mean what happened
to Francis.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.969
How do you know
it's not a trick?

31:11.971 --> 31:14.872
Staged by your Loyal Watchmen?

31:14.874 --> 31:16.506
I know you don't have
a high opinion of Lord Bothwell,

31:16.508 --> 31:18.475
but he made
his intentions clear.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.544
To warn me against Darnley.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.646
He would have me believe that
there is another future for me,

31:22.648 --> 31:25.182
one that doesn't
include Darnley.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.517
But if this prophecy is right,
then my choice is clear.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.553
Darnley can provide an heir

31:29.555 --> 31:33.390
who represents the future
of both England and Scotland.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.458
And that is more important
than having love.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.226
And what does this prophecy

31:36.228 --> 31:39.229
say about Darnley's inability
to tell the truth?

31:39.231 --> 31:41.565
It's one thing
not to have love, but...

31:42.601 --> 31:45.502
Mary, I learned something
while you were away.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.170
Darnley's lover,

31:47.172 --> 31:48.572
Lady Keira, never left town.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.407
She simply moved
to a different inn.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.342
And Darnley was seen
leaving court earlier

31:52.344 --> 31:53.610
without an escort
of royal guard.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.179
No one knows where to, but...

31:56.181 --> 31:57.981
He continues to see her.

31:59.351 --> 32:03.353
(sighs)

32:03.355 --> 32:04.588
I will marry Darnley,

32:04.590 --> 32:06.556
but I refuse to allow him

32:06.558 --> 32:09.393
to humiliate me in this way.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.161
If this gets out,
I will be the woman

32:11.163 --> 32:15.132
who couldn't keep her husband
close on the eve of her wedding.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.301
I want Keira gone.
I'll send some men.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.336
No, I want you
to remove her yourself.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.472
Throw her out into the street
if you must.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.341
But this ends now!

32:29.081 --> 32:31.148
(whispering):
Stephan.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.485
Charles, he's asked to speak

32:35.487 --> 32:36.620
with a Catholic...

32:36.622 --> 32:38.088
priest.
Oh...

32:38.090 --> 32:40.490
He's finally
come back to his true faith.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.193
You know, I had my doubts
the girl could do it.
No.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.628
It wasn't Nicole.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.331
As I hear it, it was all Luc,
your son.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.299
Luc? You certain?

32:49.301 --> 32:52.669
But since Nicole has
her hands on Charles,

32:52.671 --> 32:55.639
we best control her.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.107
You can do that.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.142
Make her fall for you.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.678
I'm not sure bedding the lover
of the king is a wise idea.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.014
Charles is infatuated
with Nicole.

33:04.016 --> 33:07.117
He'll rely on her and she will
seek to take advantage.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.585
Isn't it better that you guide

33:08.587 --> 33:12.022
her ambition than it runs wild?

33:12.024 --> 33:14.358
I will consider it.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.692
Good.
Mm.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.260
Then I'm ready to leave

33:17.262 --> 33:19.596
for Mary's wedding.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.534
I'm here by order
of the queen, Lady Keira.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.736
I have a carriage waiting.
Please,

33:25.738 --> 33:27.471
I was told she's not
to leave her room.

33:27.473 --> 33:28.538
She could...
What?

33:28.540 --> 33:30.273
Be seen?

33:30.275 --> 33:32.275
Is that what Darnley paid you
to prevent?

33:32.277 --> 33:34.578
INNKEEPER:
<i>No, I don't know any Darnley. </i>
(horse neighs)

33:34.580 --> 33:36.646
(people yelling)

33:36.648 --> 33:38.215
(Keira grunts)

33:38.217 --> 33:39.716
(gasping)
God, no!

33:39.718 --> 33:41.785
MAN:
She's hurt!
(horse neighs in distance)

33:56.435 --> 33:58.101
I would've appreciated
some warning

33:58.103 --> 34:00.404
before spending my night
in a cell.

34:00.406 --> 34:04.141
I had a meeting with the
Spanish ambassador yesterday.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.575
He insisted I arrest you.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.044
So once again,

34:07.046 --> 34:09.046
you are bending
to the will of Spain.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.249
As far as I'm concerned,

34:12.251 --> 34:13.650
their request
has been satisfied.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.519
You're right, there is no reason

34:15.521 --> 34:18.255
I can't rise
to challenge Spain's power.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.657
Except my own cowardice.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.492
(door closes)
Catholic France

34:22.494 --> 34:25.262
across the Channel,
Spanish power to the south,

34:25.264 --> 34:27.297
the looming threat
of the Vatican,

34:27.299 --> 34:29.099
Mary Stuart's Scotland.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.201
My whole life
I have been afraid

34:31.203 --> 34:33.270
of all of it.

34:33.272 --> 34:37.340
I have been so focused
on my own fear, but...

34:37.342 --> 34:40.844
I've been looking
in the wrong place.

34:42.181 --> 34:46.283
Why not compare
England to Spain?

34:46.285 --> 34:49.319
Why not stretch
our horizons beyond Europe?

34:49.321 --> 34:50.387
Once one does,

34:50.389 --> 34:53.590
Europe looks... very small.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.793
A royal charter.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.361
For exploration and trade.

34:58.363 --> 35:01.198
I designate you, John Hawkins,

35:01.200 --> 35:03.133
to navigate the New World.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.235
To plant the English flag

35:05.237 --> 35:06.736
with the full support
of the Crown.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.171
Go.

35:08.173 --> 35:10.607
Discover new lands
and new riches

35:10.609 --> 35:14.244
and claim them for your country.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.313
I want to be the queen

35:16.315 --> 35:19.216
who makes England
the greatest power

35:19.218 --> 35:22.319
the world has ever known.

35:22.321 --> 35:25.889
CLAUDE:
It's just like being under
the stars at night.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.524
Yes, well, I'm afraid
it was a little too cloudy

35:27.526 --> 35:29.526
for a real starlight picnic.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.162
Aren't you clever.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.231
I love it.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.569
No matter what is happening,

35:39.571 --> 35:42.239
even if it feels like
your world is crumbling,

35:42.241 --> 35:44.875
you can always count on
the stars to be there.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.279
Charles told me.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.281
And...

35:51.283 --> 35:54.718
I hope very much that
one day you'll think of me

35:54.720 --> 35:56.253
in the same way.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.587
I am your husband

35:57.589 --> 35:59.723
and I want to be there
when you need me, Claude.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.392
Thank you...

36:02.394 --> 36:04.828
for the stars.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.298
And... for helping Charles.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.734
Of course.
We're family.

36:12.237 --> 36:14.271
Now...

36:14.273 --> 36:16.306
I can't believe
I forgot the wine.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.175
I'll be right back.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.279
(door opens and closes)

36:22.281 --> 36:24.347
(sighs)

36:26.685 --> 36:29.319
Charles.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.289
Is everything all right?

36:32.291 --> 36:34.324
CHARLES:
Nothing will ever be all right.

36:34.326 --> 36:35.592
I want to run.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.928
Far away.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.363
But I can't go outside.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.299
The woods are dangerous.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.334
I'll start again
to ease the fear.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.605
Soil and blood...

36:48.607 --> 36:50.307
Charles.

36:51.944 --> 36:54.611
I was well.

36:54.613 --> 36:58.415
I want to stay well.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.419
GUARD:
Duchess Lucrezia di Medici.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.354
Duchess, I apologize

37:04.356 --> 37:07.357
for the delay in
acquiring the Davies estate.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.526
I hope my patience has paid off.
It will.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.294
I've encountered a few
obstacles, but if you can wait

37:11.296 --> 37:12.429
just a little bit longer...

37:12.431 --> 37:14.364
(exhales)
BOTHWELL:
No need.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.233
The estate now belongs to you,

37:16.235 --> 37:18.401
Lady Lucrezia.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.303
Queen Mary

37:20.305 --> 37:21.938
went to great lengths for it.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.540
She's a queen who will sacrifice

37:23.542 --> 37:25.242
much for her allies.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.315
(rolls paper up)

37:32.317 --> 37:33.583
Thank you, Your Grace.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.319
I am pleased to be
able to continue

37:36.321 --> 37:38.388
the alliance between
Florence and Scotland.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.832
How did you manage it?

37:48.834 --> 37:51.334
Lord Davies responded well
to your offer.

37:51.336 --> 37:54.271
I simply sweetened the deal
by giving him his choice

37:54.273 --> 37:55.905
of five of my favorite horses.

37:55.907 --> 37:59.476
Might I say...

37:59.478 --> 38:01.478
we make good partners.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.046
(footsteps approach)

38:04.283 --> 38:06.383
Thank you, Lord Bothwell.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.851
Of course, Your Majesty.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.424
Always a pleasure
doing business with you.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.596
You've welcomed him
back into court.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.431
He offered me help
when I needed it.

38:21.433 --> 38:25.468
Mary, I have bad news.

38:32.044 --> 38:34.411
Keira was sick
and weak with fever.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.946
I didn't know.
I didn't know either.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.449
I didn't even know
she'd stayed in town,

38:39.451 --> 38:41.451
but the physician
told her to stay

38:41.452 --> 38:43.452
until she was
fully recovered, which...

38:43.455 --> 38:45.388
He said death
will come this night,

38:45.390 --> 38:46.923
and it will be a mercy.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.458
I am so sorry.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.560
It was an accident, a horrible,

38:50.562 --> 38:52.462
tragic accident.
Call it an accident

38:52.464 --> 38:53.763
if it eases your conscience,

38:53.765 --> 38:55.598
but Keira is paying
with her life

38:55.600 --> 38:57.567
for your mistake.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.469
Your rage.

38:59.471 --> 39:02.405
All because you don't trust me.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.708
How can I trust you
when you keep secrets from me?

39:04.710 --> 39:06.976
Where were you going
if not to see her?

39:12.617 --> 39:14.484
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.820
I went to a jeweler in Sterling.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.855
Rubies arranged in a Tudor rose.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.424
I thought you could
wear them to our wedding

39:21.426 --> 39:23.526
as a symbol of
my commitment to you.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.362
Show the world
what our union means.

39:25.364 --> 39:26.596
All to earn

39:26.598 --> 39:28.898
your forgiveness,
as your partner.

39:30.435 --> 39:32.535
I had let go of Keira.

39:32.537 --> 39:36.539
And I was reconciled, but...

39:36.541 --> 39:38.875
but not like this.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.410
I will miss her

39:40.412 --> 39:41.878
until my dying day.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.546
But what's worse is,

39:43.548 --> 39:44.848
every time I look
at you, I will see

39:44.850 --> 39:46.583
the person who killed...

39:46.585 --> 39:48.551
The woman you truly loved.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.989
Tell me...

39:52.991 --> 39:56.526
Mary...

39:56.528 --> 39:58.595
how do I not hate you?

40:02.467 --> 40:04.467
(sighs deeply)

40:08.039 --> 40:10.106
♪ ♪

40:14.746 --> 40:16.813
(sobbing)

40:19.418 --> 40:21.050
CATHERINE:
Mary.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.886
My dear child, what is it?

40:22.888 --> 40:26.589
(crying):
Catherine...

40:26.591 --> 40:28.958
I don't want to to this.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.896
Help me get out
of this marriage.
