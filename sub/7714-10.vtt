WEBVTT

00:05.922 --> 00:07.673
Not again.

00:07.757 --> 00:10.384
Bow down
before Recyclops.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.177
Five years ago
corporate said
we had to start

00:12.262 --> 00:13.762
a recycling program
for Earth Day,

00:13.847 --> 00:15.305
so Dwight took
the lead on that,

00:15.390 --> 00:19.393
and introduced us
to a very close friend
of his named Recyclops.

00:19.894 --> 00:22.521
Happy Earth Day, everyone.
l'm Recyclops.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.023
Did you know that
an old milk carton

00:24.107 --> 00:26.358
can be sawed in half
and used as a planter?

00:26.443 --> 00:29.570
JlM: The next year,
he reaIIy stepped
things up.

00:30.238 --> 00:34.658
Who has put
a number seven plastic
in a number four bin?

00:34.743 --> 00:38.287
A year after that,
RecycIops reaIIy
began to take shape.

00:39.956 --> 00:44.793
Recyclops will drown you
in your over-watered lawns!

00:45.545 --> 00:48.547
Then tragedy struck Recyclops
when his fictional planet

00:48.631 --> 00:51.842
was attacked by some
other fictitious thing,
l can't remember.

00:51.926 --> 00:55.471
Recyclops will have
his revenge!

00:55.805 --> 00:57.931
l think this was
also the year that
he renounced Earth Day

00:58.016 --> 01:01.143
and vowed to
destroy the planet
he once loved.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.562
Oh, my God,
you guys, look!
lt's Recyclops!

01:03.646 --> 01:06.398
Recyclops destroy!

01:06.483 --> 01:08.317
(BELLOWlNG)

01:10.904 --> 01:13.030
Oh, is today
Recyclops Day?
Yes.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.074
l thought you were killed
by Polluticon or something.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.909
Polluticon wishes.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.662
That's aerosol spray.
lt's terrible for
the environment.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.706
DWlGHT:
Humans are terrible
for the environment.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.500
(BELLOWlNG)

01:25.960 --> 01:27.753
The thing l like most
about Recyclops

01:27.837 --> 01:30.547
is that he's creating
a different world
for our child.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.632
Hmm.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.760
A world where
you truIy can be
anything you want.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.178
JIM: God bless you,
RecycIops,

01:36.262 --> 01:38.013
and your coId
robot heart.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.633
Okay. Okay.
How about this?

02:15.844 --> 02:16.844
That's great.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.637
l want it to be better
than great, Pam.

02:18.721 --> 02:22.182
How about l remain seated
and l just do a little bit
of a nod,

02:22.267 --> 02:24.268
sort of a humble thing?
Sure.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.603
No. Then my face is down.
They can't see my face.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.938
And it looks like
you're taking a dump.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.817
Alan Brand who's
the CEO of the company,

02:31.901 --> 02:33.652
if title is important
to you,

02:33.736 --> 02:38.073
has personally invited
moi to go to New York

02:38.158 --> 02:39.741
to the shareholders'
meeting

02:39.826 --> 02:42.286
and sit up on the stage
with the board of directors.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.955
And at some point,
they're going to
introduce me

02:45.039 --> 02:49.751
as the most successful
branch manager
that they have.

02:49.836 --> 02:53.922
And then Michael Scott turns
and waves to the crowd.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.425
And the crowd goes wild.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.970
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Scranton, Pennsylvania,

03:00.054 --> 03:04.600
please welcome
Michael "The Machine" Scott!

03:07.395 --> 03:08.395
Oh.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.063
Don't do the twirl.
Lose the twirl.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.065
DWlGHT: Twirl sucks.
Michael, l hated the twirl.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.317
Hate the twirl.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.611
Okay, obviously
l'm not going
to do the twirl.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.487
l only did it because
l nailed the wave.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.031
Yeah, good.
Don't do it.

03:19.115 --> 03:23.368
(ENUNClATlNG) l'm not going
to do the twirl, all right?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.245
lt's not even a twirl.
lt's a spin.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.124
l might do the spin.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.920
The long-term problem
is bad investments
that they need to dump.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.671
And the short-term problem
is the company

03:34.756 --> 03:36.381
has no cash and
there's nowhere
to get it.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.384
Okay, Oscar. l don't need
the whole enchilada,
just bullet points.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.552
Those are
the bullet points.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.095
Well, could you
condense it, please?

03:42.180 --> 03:43.639
That's as simple
as l can make it.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.973
Michael, the limo's
here for you.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.642
lt's not a limo,
it's a town car.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.060
Town cars are
actually better, though,

03:48.144 --> 03:49.853
better torque,
better handling.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.230
He said limousine, so. . .

03:51.314 --> 03:54.316
Check it out, guys,
there's a limo down here.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.449
Michael, look.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.912
Oh, man !
lt's a limo.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.038
They sent a limo.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.457
Town cars suck.
A town car

04:10.541 --> 04:12.584
is something that
a company sends when
they're in trouble.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.963
A limousine is something
that a company sends

04:16.047 --> 04:19.091
when they have cause
for celebration.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.678
And in this case,
l think we are
celebrating me.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.393
KEVlN: Move it! Quick!

04:29.477 --> 04:31.687
MlCHAEL: (LAUGHS)
Wow! Wow!

04:31.771 --> 04:33.730
ANDY: Oh, no way!
Yeah !

04:36.442 --> 04:38.277
What kind of mileage
does this baby get?

04:38.361 --> 04:41.238
lt's like what
high school kids take
to prom on TV shows.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.949
So typical of management
to spend money on this.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.951
(EXCLAlMlNG)
Bunch of boobs!

04:46.035 --> 04:48.495
Hate to break it to you,
Oscar, but some of us
like boobs.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.372
Calves.
Calves all the way.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.748
l'm so jealous
right now.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.584
Hey, you know who you
should be jealous of?

04:54.669 --> 04:56.003
Yourself.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.964
Because you're invited,
and you're invited,

04:59.048 --> 05:01.008
and you're invited,
and you, and you,

05:01.134 --> 05:02.634
and you and you
and you and you. . .
Car seats eight.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.969
What?
The car seats eight.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.345
The limo seats eight.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.181
Okay, then Jim and Pam
and Ryan plus a guest.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.266
No.
No, thanks.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.976
l'll use it
when you're done.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.061
MlCHAEL: Mmm.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.231
Whoa.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.443
The Dunder Mifflin
stock symbol is DMl.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.028
Do you know what
that stands for?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.904
Dummies,
Morons and ldiots,

05:22.989 --> 05:25.615
because that's what
you'd have to be to own it.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.536
And as one of those idiots,
l believe the board owes me
answers.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.330
MlCHAEL: l wish
the windows
weren't tinted

05:31.414 --> 05:33.415
so people could
see us in here.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.335
Hey, guys, do you think
anyone might have had
sex in here?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.211
Definitely.
Definitely.
Smells like it.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.838
Look, they got pillows.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.090
That, that's bigger
than my bed.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.426
Word.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.928
MlCHAEL: Who's playing
with the button?

05:48.848 --> 05:50.599
Hey, Ryan,
could you start
consolidating

05:50.683 --> 05:52.351
all our Rolodex
information
into Outlook?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.186
Doesn't seem like
there's much of a point

05:54.270 --> 05:55.395
if the company's
going under.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.605
But if the company
doesn't go under,

05:56.689 --> 05:58.315
then we'll finally
have all our contacts
in one program.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.359
Company's probably
going under, though.
lt could go either way.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.568
Seems like it's
leaning one way.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.986
Maybe we should just
wait and find out.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.071
Definitely.
Okay.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.990
So should we wait to
find out before we start
doing all this stuff?

06:07.075 --> 06:09.284
Nah. Might as well
do it now.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.874
Michael,
what if somebody asks you
a question at this meeting?

06:15.958 --> 06:17.042
Are you just
going to wave or what?

06:17.126 --> 06:18.502
l will have to answer.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.586
l'll ask you
a question.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.796
Make it a softball.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.382
Something he can, like,
crank out of the park.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.551
Michael Scott, you run
the most profitable branch
of Dunder Mifflin.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.803
Yeah.
How do you do it?

06:27.887 --> 06:31.598
No, no, that's too hard.
Say, your name is Zamboni,

06:31.974 --> 06:34.768
and then l will say,
"Well, we're sort of
on thin ice."

06:34.852 --> 06:35.894
(LAUGHS)
Uh-oh !

06:35.978 --> 06:37.437
l won't say that.
l'll say something
like that.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.065
ANDY: This is
your big day.
Come on.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.567
Whoo.
Oh, my God.
This is it.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.736
LAURlE: Mr. Scott?
Yes.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.071
l'm Laurie.
Oh, hi.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.572
Thank you
for joining us.
Come with me.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.825
Well, thank you.
And please call. . .

06:49.909 --> 06:51.868
Continue to call me
Mr. Scott.

06:51.953 --> 06:52.953
(CHUCKLlNG) Okay.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.871
lf you just want to
follow me l'll take you
up to the lounge.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.749
Well, l guess this is
as far as l can take
you guys, so. . .

06:57.875 --> 06:59.626
DWlGHT: Good luck,
Michael.
See you later.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.005
Officers. Thank you.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.090
After you, Mr. Scott.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.508
Thank you.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.218
Michael.
Hello.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.469
So glad you
could make it.
Thank you.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.595
How was the ride?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.640
Oh. lt was awesome.
Very, very sublime.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.725
l'm glad. l want
to introduce you
to everyone.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.769
Okay.
First we'll start
with Alan Brand.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.271
Alan, CEO.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.523
Michael Scott,
Branch Manager, Scranton.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.567
lt's nice to
meet you, Michael.
Nice to meet you, too.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.944
lt's an honor
and a privilege.

07:26.028 --> 07:29.114
Seated, we have
the former congressman,
Chris O'Keefe.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.282
Your eminence.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.952
For those of you
with questions,
please line up

07:34.036 --> 07:35.287
behind one of
the four microphones

07:35.371 --> 07:36.580
that have been placed
in the aisles.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.248
Coming through !
(SHOOlNG)

07:53.306 --> 07:56.600
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.144
(GRUNTS) Damn it!

08:01.230 --> 08:03.148
What. . . Okay.
(GRUNTlNG)

08:05.026 --> 08:07.986
l was hoping to lob Michael
a softball question early.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.030
l wanted to swing by
the Garment District,

08:10.114 --> 08:12.407
pick up a few crates
of my shirts.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.034
l got a shirt guy.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.912
OSCAR: Would you
believe this?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.706
The money they spent
on this convention hall !

08:19.790 --> 08:21.041
Excuse me, miss.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.960
Just want to take this
stupid board of directors
by their necks.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.670
This is so simple.

08:25.755 --> 08:26.880
Yeah.
ldiots!

08:26.964 --> 08:28.840
Well, you should do that.
Get in line.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.135
Oh, what a great idea,
and lose my job.
No, thank you.

08:34.055 --> 08:37.349
Look, do you
want to be able to
tell your grandkids

08:37.433 --> 08:38.683
you stood up
for yourself

08:38.768 --> 08:41.728
during America's
biggest financial crisis?

08:42.855 --> 08:45.273
How is he going
to have grandkids?

08:46.734 --> 08:48.318
You guys ever
protect the President?

08:48.402 --> 08:49.569
No.

08:49.946 --> 08:54.199
What about Madonna
or Obama twins?
Anybody famous?

08:54.283 --> 08:56.076
Not supposed to
talk about it.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.285
Nelly Furtado.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.578
ALAN: All right, guys.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.997
Are you ready?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.499
Rock and roll.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.005
(AUDlENCE BOOlNG)

09:22.853 --> 09:25.730
Dunder Mifflin is
stiII a strong company,

09:25.815 --> 09:28.066
and we are poised
to come through this

09:28.150 --> 09:31.444
more streamlined and
profitabIe than ever.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.446
(JEERlNG)

09:33.739 --> 09:35.907
This is not as much fun
as l thought it would be.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.243
lt was fun when we weren't
on the brink of bankruptcy.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.744
(OVER MlC) We're going
bankrupt, you think?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.580
(AUDlENCE CLAMORlNG)

09:42.498 --> 09:44.541
They are really angry.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.877
The shareholders
need to empower
our Ieadership...

09:47.962 --> 09:49.212
l'm just going to
run to the bathroom.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.589
Will you save my place?
Sure.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.257
No. He will not.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.425
Excuse me?

09:53.509 --> 09:56.595
Oh, l'm sorry. Were you
raised in a household
with no consequences?

09:56.679 --> 09:57.721
lt'll just be a second.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.805
Oh.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.433
lf onlys and justs
were candies and nuts

10:01.517 --> 10:04.019
then every day
would be Erntedankfest.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.731
...and we're confident
there are many things

10:07.815 --> 10:10.609
to be optimistic about
in Dunder Mifflin's future.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.445
And one of them is
here with us today.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.741

Like an express Iine

of 1 0 words or less.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.065
That could move
much more efficientIy.

21:17.651 --> 21:21.320

aIong the Iines that
you can hoId on to?
