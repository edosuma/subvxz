It fits you, but remember,
I'm back now.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.941
We need you to make
a public statement

about abortion.

We don't need the--

I was pretty clear.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.880
I'm a Bossy lady now.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.383
You signed her
behind my back.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.351
Philly Street used to be hot
back in the day.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.619
He's a nobody.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.820
LUCIOUS:
Philly Street.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.955
I heard you've been talking
about me.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.591
Therapy's for white people,

it would end like this.

Lucious,
what are you doing in here?

02:14.235 --> 02:17.338
This is the master bedroom,
and I'm the master.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.240
Fine.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.743
I thought you was comfortable
over there in the guest wing.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.379
You've been hiding out
over there for days.

02:25.413 --> 02:29.082
Okay, now, why is my stuff
in these cheap-ass boxes?

02:29.183 --> 02:31.719
'Cause I'm moving back
into my bedroom,

02:31.819 --> 02:34.688
and I want you out of here
by the end of the night.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.358
You can move into any room that
makes you feel comfortable.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.692
You can be the guest.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.795
You must be out
of your damn mind.

02:41.829 --> 02:46.099
No, I'm tired of living
in my house like I'm a guest.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.336
Why are you coming at me
like this, Lucious?

02:48.436 --> 02:50.904
You know why I'm coming at you!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.706
You betrayed me.

02:52.806 --> 02:56.744
When I was good to you,
you lied to me.

02:56.777 --> 03:00.113
Negro, I have forgiven you
a million times

03:00.214 --> 03:02.583
for your dirty,
little filthy lies,

03:02.683 --> 03:05.353

for once?

'Cause you don't deserve it.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.223
(dramatic music)

03:09.323 --> 03:13.527
You humiliated me by confiding
in that son of a bitch Damon.

03:13.627 --> 03:17.531
Damon held me hostage,
and shot me because of you.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.367
No, because of you.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.203
Juanita!

03:23.237 --> 03:25.739
I got research for my show,

03:25.839 --> 03:28.141

to host.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.443
-I don't have time for this BS.
-LUCIOUS: Do me a favor.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.379
Have the movers
move these boxes

03:31.479 --> 03:32.446

Cookie wants.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.349
Juanita, ignore him.
He's on his period.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.618
Why don't y'all just call me
when you've made up your mind

03:37.718 --> 03:38.886
about what you
really want to do?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.254

03:49.129 --> 03:51.465
Hmm.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.935
You talked a great deal
about Lucious.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.272
So, if Lucious is,
in your words,

03:58.372 --> 04:02.776
the problem,
why are you fighting so hard

04:02.810 --> 04:05.346
to stay in the house with him?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.848
Well, because Empire
built that house.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.350
Damn right.

04:09.450 --> 04:13.354
And I built Empire,
so that makes it my damn house.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.890
And Andre is there
with my new grandbaby,

04:16.924 --> 04:18.659
and I'm not going nowhere
this time.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.994
That's the family house,
and I shouldn't have to leave.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.130
Nope, not this time.
Mm-mm.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.599
So, it's not Lucious
that's keeping you there?

04:25.699 --> 04:26.967
No.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.502
I didn't miss his ass
when he was gone.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.641
You know, when we were young,
my sister Carol brought home

04:33.674 --> 04:36.644
this little mangy lost dog,

04:36.744 --> 04:39.112
and that little thing just,
"Yap, yap, yap, yap."

04:39.212 --> 04:41.649
I just--and he had nasty fur

04:41.749 --> 04:43.384
that he got
all over everything.

04:43.484 --> 04:47.688
And when his owner
finally came and got him,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.557
I kind of missed him.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.224
You know, like that.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.661
DR. WICK: Okay, so you're
comparing your husband,

04:53.761 --> 04:55.463
the man you married twice,
the father of your children

04:55.563 --> 04:57.498
with whom you built Empire

04:57.598 --> 05:00.934
to a mangy dog?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.536
And I'm being nice.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.339
But see, you would understand
if you met him.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.540
Okay.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
Let's discuss setting up

05:08.742 --> 05:11.211
some clear
and healthy boundaries

05:11.311 --> 05:13.280
while you and
your mangy dog...

05:13.313 --> 05:14.214
Mm-hmm.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.483
Are under the same roof.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.874
How you doing, brother?

05:40.908 --> 05:43.110
PHILLY STREET: Huh.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.446
You kicked me
out of your movie.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.015
Now you come all the way
down here to rub it in my face?

05:48.181 --> 05:51.284
No, you just popped up
out of the middle of nowhere.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.020
What was that about?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.255
Everybody knows there
wouldn't be no Lucious Lyon

05:55.288 --> 05:56.457
if it wasn't for Philly Street.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.291
Oh, you think so, huh?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.394
Oh, I know so.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.731
(tense music)

06:03.831 --> 06:06.299
Now I'm spitting with you.
(chuckles)

06:06.400 --> 06:09.837
Lucious, I was locked up
for a dub.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.706
I been let that go.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.875
But this movie,
that's your job, man.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.611
Do whatever the hell
you choose.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.779
But I am honored
that you took the time

06:18.879 --> 06:20.714
to come down and see me.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.716
(chuckles)

06:22.750 --> 06:25.285
Ain't you full of surprises,
man?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.754
I thought I was gonna
come down here;

06:26.854 --> 06:27.755
you'd be all--

06:27.855 --> 06:29.256
Bent out of shape,

06:29.356 --> 06:30.991
'cause you blew up
when I was locked up?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.726
Hell no.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.095
I meant no disrespect, man.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.365
It's just this is
the Lucious Lyon legacy.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.801
Philly Street deserves
his own damn movie, man.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.503
Nah.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.439
Lucious, there's not one day
that I don't regret

06:45.539 --> 06:48.075
laying that boy Khalil down
for robbing me.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.110
He got me for a mil.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.747
But, man, if I wouldn't have
picked up that gun

06:53.847 --> 06:55.649
and pulled that trigger,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.350
I could have got that back!

06:57.451 --> 07:00.253
Lucious, I could have
got that back 100 times.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.124
That's on me.

07:04.224 --> 07:07.127
Look here, man.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.497
I want you to come
by the studio.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.131
And you and me,
we gonna chop it up

07:11.231 --> 07:12.500
in front of them boards
the way we should have done

07:12.600 --> 07:13.834
a long time ago.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.436
-For real?
-Real talk.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.271
(exhales deeply)

07:18.305 --> 07:19.439
Thank you, man.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.608
You're welcome.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.010
(emotional music)

07:23.110 --> 07:24.712
*

07:26.346 --> 07:28.281
ANDRE: Tiana's departure hurts,

07:28.381 --> 07:30.484
but it also affords us
new opportunities.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.252
We need to fast track
Treasure's album.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.987
She's poised to be an
even bigger star than Tiana.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.856
Wait, Treasure ain't no way
near ready.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.390
We still have a few tracks
to record.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.659
Let's get her in the studio
today and knock it out.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.360
LUCIOUS: Wait, hold on.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.696
Forgive me for interrupting,
son,

07:42.796 --> 07:47.034
but why have we moved up
Treasure's release date?

07:48.569 --> 07:51.404
Jamal's in London,
and Hakeem is filming.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.140
But to the audience,

07:53.240 --> 07:54.708
that's gonna look like
we replaced

07:54.808 --> 07:56.644
our most beloved female artist

07:56.744 --> 07:58.512
with just
another female artist.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.880
Looking at the marketplace

07:59.980 --> 08:01.882
and our competitor's
release schedule, Pop,

08:01.915 --> 08:03.651
well, this is the best move.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.852
No, no, no, no.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.854
We never go chasing
after competitors.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.022
We lead the pack.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.992
What we need to do is
go with Devon, something new.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.928
Um, everybody take ten, please.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.606
Empire is breaking records
worldwide

08:25.706 --> 08:26.940
and on my watch, okay?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.576
So, you can trust me.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.278
No, no, I know,
and I'm so proud

08:31.378 --> 08:33.781
of how you've led this company
while I was gone.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.448
I appreciate that Pop, okay?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.851
But Treasure has
a massive following.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.252
There's no controversy
surrounding her.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.721
Her metrics mirror Tiana's.

08:40.821 --> 08:41.955
Metrics, metrics.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.924
My God,
you sound like Kingsley.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.793
I mean, I taught you
better than that.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.762
Look, why don't we have
a little contest?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.097
Now, we'll have
Treasure and Devon

08:50.197 --> 08:52.265
both record the same single,

08:52.365 --> 08:55.135
and we'll put it out
and see what the fans like.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.570
So whoever gets
the most streams,

08:56.604 --> 08:58.138
gets Tiana's release date?

08:58.238 --> 09:02.109
That is if you're up for
a little father-son challenge.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.977
Always.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.947
(dramatic music)

09:12.152 --> 09:13.220
("Threat" plays)

09:13.320 --> 09:15.088
GISELLE: Bossy is bold.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.625
It's bracing.
It's badass.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.992
It's a brave new venture.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.328
It's truly a first
for women in music.

09:21.428 --> 09:25.398
Bossy is bank,
which is why I'm proud to say

09:25.432 --> 09:27.601
Bossy Media is
my brand-new home.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.469
* Trying to settle the score

09:29.569 --> 09:32.740
GISELLE:
Tiana is a phenomenal talent.

09:32.773 --> 09:36.276
We are proud to have
this iconic female artist

09:36.376 --> 09:38.712
as our premiere act.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.080
Lala is her name,

09:40.180 --> 09:42.315
Our debut artist
who's unlike anything

09:42.415 --> 09:43.450
you've ever heard.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.485
She's fresh talent
who allows Bossy

09:45.585 --> 09:47.354
to curate our own stage.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.956
So watch out, world.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.392
* Apologize if you think
my beauty is a threat *

09:52.425 --> 09:53.761
"Bad or Bossy"?

09:53.861 --> 09:55.128
-What the hell is this?
-Just...

09:55.228 --> 09:56.697
turn it off, please.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.432
How did an exclusive
turn into a bashing?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.434
Well, actually,
I really blame them,

10:01.534 --> 10:03.871
the way you out here
trotting around Empire's ex

10:03.971 --> 10:05.338
as if we're breaking
brand-new ground.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.307
Becky, we talked about this.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.210
Tiana was the get we needed
to kick our girl-boss goals

10:10.310 --> 10:11.812
into high gear.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.381
It is not a good look
when the two women in charge

10:14.481 --> 10:15.615
aren't on the same page.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.817
Oh, okay,
then won't you tell me

10:16.917 --> 10:18.819
what is a good look, then, sis?

10:18.919 --> 10:21.955
Because it certainly is not
the cover art that you chose

10:21.989 --> 10:23.523
for Lala's album.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.558
Well, it definitely isn't
those three interns you hired

10:25.659 --> 10:27.728
who work about as hard
as Lala sings.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.030
All right, I'm gonna take
an early lunch.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.965
Come on.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.400
What are you doing,
running away?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.669
-We have to talk this out.
-BECKY: Uh-uh.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.338
I need to go before I say
something disrespectful

10:38.438 --> 10:39.572
to my elders.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.176
Elders?
Really, sis?

10:43.276 --> 10:45.578
(stomping)

10:47.347 --> 10:50.283
(soft R&B music)

10:50.317 --> 10:54.154
* Lately, you've been
up to your neck in stress *

10:54.254 --> 10:56.189
So, what do you think?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.759
Yours to record,
a bona fide Empire hit.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.428
Yeah, written for Tiana, right?

11:01.528 --> 11:03.530
* World up on your shoulders

11:03.563 --> 11:04.832
* Breaking you down

11:04.932 --> 11:06.867
(music stops)

11:06.967 --> 11:09.002
I'd like you to record this
as your first single.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.238
I don't wanna clout chase
off of her leftovers.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.272
I'm my own artist.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.041
And an incredible one.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.844
Which is Empire is prepared
to put all resources

11:16.877 --> 11:18.045
behind your debut.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.580
A hit single,
appearances, promotions...

11:20.680 --> 11:22.249
It's because you can do
with this song

11:22.349 --> 11:23.516
what Tiana couldn't.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.218
You can elevate it.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.621
I just wanna elevate music
that tells my story

11:28.722 --> 11:31.258
and my sound, you know?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.293
I want that for you too,
which is also why

11:33.393 --> 11:35.295
I've already set up
your session.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.596
The sooner you record,

11:36.696 --> 11:39.032
the sooner
your album's released.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.935
(solemn music)

11:42.035 --> 11:43.370
*

11:43.403 --> 11:45.305
Porsha's waiting for you
in studio three.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.740
Oh, I'm not done here.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.908
Yeah, but he is.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.243
(scoffs)

11:52.479 --> 11:54.214
Hey, Juanita.
Ooh, that look good.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.548
Hi, Ms. Cookie.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.786
Uh, Juanita...

11:58.886 --> 11:59.953
Yes?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.654
What the hell is this?

12:01.755 --> 12:03.991
Mr. Lucious said
anything with his name on it

12:04.091 --> 12:05.658
was off limits,

12:05.759 --> 12:07.394
and he left
very strict instructions.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.763
The horseradish?

12:09.863 --> 12:10.964
(Cookie scoffs)

12:11.064 --> 12:13.000
He's so petty.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.669
You can tell Mr. Lucious

12:16.770 --> 12:20.107
that he can kiss my black ass.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.775
Is everything all right,
Cookie?

12:21.875 --> 12:22.776
Ooh!

12:22.876 --> 12:24.144
Everything is perfect

12:24.244 --> 12:25.913
now that
my little angel is here.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.480
(Cookie sniffs)

12:27.580 --> 12:29.582
Walker is getting ready
for his first wellness checkup.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.683
Oh.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.285
Have you seen Andre?

12:32.385 --> 12:33.954
He was supposed to meet us here
and he's late.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.122
Oh, you know that boy.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.289
He's probably already
at the doctor's office

12:36.389 --> 12:37.991
waiting for y'all.

12:38.091 --> 12:38.959
If you hear from him,
tell him that we had to go.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.227
COOKIE: Okay.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.363
Uh, really, Juanita,
right in my face?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.966
Well, Mr. Lucious said

12:46.066 --> 12:47.367
that Teri and Walker were
on his list.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.470
Oh, you finna end up
on my list.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.604
You his hitman now?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.142
I'm sorry, Cookie.
That's...

12:55.242 --> 12:56.509
(sighs)

12:56.609 --> 12:58.946
Let's just hope Andre
didn't get petty

12:59.046 --> 13:00.347
from his father.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.850
He already got cra--never mind.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.551
Have a good day.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.485
-Thank you, Cookie.
-COOKIE: Mm-hmm.

13:08.355 --> 13:12.159
(soft R&B music)

13:12.259 --> 13:14.895
* I know your world is
moving fast, but *

13:14.995 --> 13:18.498
* Let me put you in cruise

13:18.598 --> 13:20.467
* Enjoy the ride

13:20.567 --> 13:23.203
* Let me kick back with you

13:23.236 --> 13:24.237
BACKUP SINGERS:
* Let me kick back with you

13:24.337 --> 13:25.405
Okay, that's hot.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.473
Turn it up
just a little bit more.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.141
I got you, mommy.
I got you.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.878
* Cruise

13:30.978 --> 13:32.312
* Let me get you right

13:32.412 --> 13:34.347
* You deserve to feel cool

13:34.447 --> 13:35.648
BACKUP SINGERS: * Baby

13:35.682 --> 13:37.350
Cut, cut.
I'm sorry.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.686
I'm not feeling
this whack-ass track.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.588
Here we go.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.858
Can you give us a sec?

13:44.958 --> 13:46.193
Not a problem.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.463
(sighs)

13:50.497 --> 13:52.165
(door opens)

13:52.265 --> 13:54.201
-You know what I'm not feeling?
-(door closes)

13:54.301 --> 13:55.502
Your whack-ass attitude.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.904
But guess what.
I'm here anyway.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.371
You wanna know why?

13:58.471 --> 14:00.340
Because I got a lot to prove
as a new A&R.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.209
Okay, and I have a lot to prove
as a new artist.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.710
Keep playing with Andre,
and he gonna cancel

14:03.743 --> 14:04.677
the both of our asses.

14:04.777 --> 14:05.879
Porsha, listen.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.514
All I'm trying to say is that

14:07.614 --> 14:09.349
when the fans hear this song,

14:09.449 --> 14:11.218
they're gonna know that Empire
just threw me

14:11.318 --> 14:13.053
one of Tiana's tracks,
because she flew the coop.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.521
And that's not okay.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.755
It's creative suicide.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.357
Then breathe some life
into this joint.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.792
I can play with the track,
throw some bass on it,

14:19.893 --> 14:20.961
and you can make it your own.

14:21.061 --> 14:21.962
Okay.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.196
-Okay?
-Yeah.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.197
DEVON: * Let me put you

14:24.297 --> 14:27.267
* In cruise

14:27.367 --> 14:33.340
* Enjoy the ride,
let me kick back with you *

14:33.373 --> 14:37.945
* Late night feelings
on cruise *

14:38.045 --> 14:39.779
* Let me get you right

14:39.879 --> 14:43.616
* You deserve to feel cool

14:43.716 --> 14:45.285
* All these good vibes

14:45.318 --> 14:49.822
* We can put that on cruise

14:49.923 --> 14:51.158
BACKUP SINGERS:
* Cruise

14:51.258 --> 14:54.094
Glad you could make it.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.729
(sighs)
What else did I have to do?

14:56.829 --> 14:58.598
DEVON:
* To catch all your fears

14:58.698 --> 15:01.534
* And for every day goes by

15:01.568 --> 15:03.436
PHILLY STREET:
Oh, that boy phenomenal.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.572
Where'd you find him?

15:05.672 --> 15:08.341
Actually, in a junkyard.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.809
DEVON: * Wearing wings

15:09.909 --> 15:11.844
Have a seat, man.

15:11.945 --> 15:16.716
DEVON:
* I can put you in cruise

15:16.749 --> 15:18.251
* Enjoy the ride

15:18.351 --> 15:20.453
* And let me kick back
with you *

15:20.553 --> 15:23.256
Man, it's been a while

15:23.356 --> 15:25.758
since I've been in a lab.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.462
I can't lie.
I miss it.

15:29.562 --> 15:33.166
DEVON:
* You deserve to feel cool

15:33.266 --> 15:34.634
* All these good vibes

15:34.734 --> 15:37.370
* I can put it on cruise

15:37.470 --> 15:40.640
Yo, why don't you throw
some harmonies on that junk?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.709
Why don't you do it?

15:42.809 --> 15:44.978
Seriously?

15:45.112 --> 15:48.115
Absolutely.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.983
Youngblood could use
a little old school,

15:50.083 --> 15:51.318
don't you think?

15:51.418 --> 15:52.652
Yeah.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.655
And if it works out,

15:55.688 --> 15:58.191
I always could use
another hit-maker on the squad.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.694
DEVON: * Late night feelings
on cruise *

16:01.794 --> 16:02.729
BACKUP SINGERS:
* I'll get you right

16:02.829 --> 16:04.131
* Every time, baby

16:04.231 --> 16:05.132
DEVON:
* Let me get you right

16:05.232 --> 16:07.167
* You deserve to feel cool

16:07.267 --> 16:08.068
BACKUP SINGERS:
* Girl, you deserve it

16:08.168 --> 16:09.536
* You deserve it

16:09.569 --> 16:10.503
DEVON:
* All these good vibes

16:10.603 --> 16:12.405
* I can put it on cruise

16:12.505 --> 16:15.142
*

16:15.242 --> 16:17.244
* Cruise

16:17.344 --> 16:18.878
* Yeah, yeah

16:18.978 --> 16:20.180
-* I just wanna cruise
-(music stops)

16:20.280 --> 16:23.050
Now, I'm sure you guys can
all agree

16:23.083 --> 16:24.751
we've just witnessed
another Empire classic

16:24.851 --> 16:25.918
in the making.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.220
So let's get this--

16:27.320 --> 16:28.555
Just dump it right there
on the table, fellas,

16:28.655 --> 16:29.889
right in the middle.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.592
-Hello, everybody!
-Wait, what are you doing?

16:32.692 --> 16:34.061
COOKIE:
Christmas has come early.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.396
You get a Gucci.
You got Prada, girl!

16:36.496 --> 16:38.231
Take your pick.
There's Gucci.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.200
Oh, baby, that'll look good
on you, honey.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.535
-Go ahead, make yourself...
-Everybody, out, out.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.037
-Everybody, out right now.
-COOKIE: Okay, everybody, out.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.105
LUCIOUS: Out!

16:45.205 --> 16:46.673
"Everybody out."

16:46.773 --> 16:48.007
Why didn't you take them
Gucci shoes?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.609
They match your jacket.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.744
Have you lost your damn mind?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.880
I might have.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.748
You don't want my stuff
in the house, Lucious,

16:55.848 --> 16:58.551
so I figured your stuff
is better off here

16:58.651 --> 17:00.053
in your Empire.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.554
Let me tell you something,
Lucious.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.856
You don't wanna feel like
a stranger in our house.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.326
That's fine,
but I will be damned

17:06.359 --> 17:09.229
if I'm made to feel like
I don't belong there.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.298
(dramatic music)

17:11.398 --> 17:13.466
Now, pick up your peg leg
and match your suit,

17:13.566 --> 17:15.402
you damn pirate.

17:15.502 --> 17:21.541
*

17:28.081 --> 17:29.216
(girls laugh)

17:29.316 --> 17:30.983
(sultry music)

17:31.084 --> 17:32.719
*

17:32.752 --> 17:35.455
(laughter)

17:35.555 --> 17:37.424
*

17:37.524 --> 17:39.426
What gives?

17:39.526 --> 17:40.793
Apparently, you do.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.463
A lot,
according to Hey Girl Hey.

17:43.563 --> 17:47.367
*

17:47.400 --> 17:49.669
"Devon 'swangs'
that 'thang'"?

17:49.769 --> 17:51.338
(scoffs)

17:51.438 --> 17:52.772
I don't even get down
like that.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.774
You rocking and knocking
somebody boots up in here.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.310
And it's not your girl Tiana,
so...

17:57.410 --> 18:00.313
Wait, hold up.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.749
That's not--that's not even me.

18:02.849 --> 18:03.750
Okay.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.852
I'm not mad if it is.
Are you, sis?

18:05.952 --> 18:07.086
No, not at all.

18:07.187 --> 18:10.657
I mean, Tiana might be,
but I'm good.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.462
I don't get how a video of me
goes viral,

18:15.495 --> 18:17.364
and it's not even me.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.132
LUCIOUS: Listen,
you just gotta understand

18:19.232 --> 18:22.502
that nobody in this room
is above a little controversy.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.137
I swear on my life.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.938
I don't need to pimp my junk
to sell records.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.507
My music speaks for itself.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.808
One would hope.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.277
LUCIOUS:
I've got the head of tech

18:30.377 --> 18:33.313
working overtime
trying to figure out

18:33.413 --> 18:35.315
who's behind this whole thing,
and I bet you

18:35.415 --> 18:37.950
it's some little kid
up in Russia

18:38.050 --> 18:39.952
doing the whole damn thing.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.322
But Publicity has put out
a statement.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.491
All you need to do is just keep
working on your music,

18:44.591 --> 18:46.159
and this whole thing
is gonna blow over.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.161
-I promise you.
-Of course.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.163
-Just fix it.
-I will.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.566
You'll be all right, man.
I been through worse.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.937
(curious music)

18:57.970 --> 19:00.173
So, the Russians are
not only trying

19:00.273 --> 19:03.142
to undermine our democracy;
they're trying to derail Devon?

19:03.243 --> 19:07.547
Well, if the goal was
to derail Devon,

19:07.647 --> 19:09.249
they have failed miserably,

19:09.349 --> 19:12.285
because he's about to become
a household name

19:12.319 --> 19:14.754
and his single...

19:14.854 --> 19:18.391
it's already breaking
the Top 10 as we speak.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.527
How's your Treasure doing?

19:20.627 --> 19:22.762
*

19:22.862 --> 19:25.031
(peaceful music)

19:25.064 --> 19:26.666
CANDACE: Hmm.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.769
"Visuge" steaming, Cookie,
really?

19:29.869 --> 19:30.703
All right, sis,
we really could have

19:30.803 --> 19:32.439
rescheduled
the fundraiser meeting.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.207
Okay, look, both of y'all.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.509
I said that I have research
for hot topics, okay,

19:36.609 --> 19:38.345
while we finalize
the fundraising details,

19:38.378 --> 19:39.279
all right?

19:39.379 --> 19:40.680
Don't burn out on me now.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.914
No, it's kind of hard
to do that

19:42.014 --> 19:43.716
when you feel like you got
fire up your coo--

19:43.816 --> 19:45.051
ALL: Ooh.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.953
-(Candace laughs)
-Ooh.

19:47.053 --> 19:50.122
I mean, sis, she getting
real ready down there.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.424
You sure you're not prepping

19:51.524 --> 19:52.725
for a little Tea Talk
with Lucious?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.861
-CANDACE: Ooh.
-Child, please.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.029
Me and that man haven't
two-stepped to the same beat

19:57.129 --> 19:58.931
in...in a minute

19:59.031 --> 20:01.100
Anyway, he won't forgive me,
so...

20:01.200 --> 20:02.869
Shouldn't he be seeking
forgiveness

20:02.969 --> 20:04.471
for what he put you through?

20:04.571 --> 20:05.638
Hmm?

20:05.738 --> 20:08.040
Yeah, well,
my therapist said...

20:08.074 --> 20:08.975
Excuse you.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.710
Therapist?

20:10.810 --> 20:13.313
Yes, I'm seeing a therapist,
bitches.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.982
But, sis, you dumped Lucious'
clothes all over Empire.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.950
I'm not too sure
the therapy is working.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.087
It is called setting
healthy boundaries, okay?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.390
I'm not so sure that's what
your therapist meant.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.791
You need to take time
for yourself.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.459
Stop working so hard,

20:26.559 --> 20:28.728
and get out of that vicious
cycle with Lucious.

20:28.828 --> 20:29.829
CAROL: Hmm.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.231
Sis,
the cycle is called marriage,

20:32.332 --> 20:34.734
and it wouldn't be so vicious
if she would just admit

20:34.767 --> 20:36.436
she wants Lucious back.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.305
You know the man loves
her dirty drawers

20:38.405 --> 20:39.972
no matter how much he acts out.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.341
But it's not healthy.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.443
All of this back-and-forth,

20:43.543 --> 20:45.845
it's like their twisted version
of foreplay.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.780
Why are y'all two
sitting up here,

20:47.814 --> 20:50.016
talking about me
like I'm not in the room?

20:50.116 --> 20:51.418
Well.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.753
All I got to say, sis,
is you need to kick back

20:53.853 --> 20:55.288
and enjoy the steam,

20:55.388 --> 20:57.790
because that girl is about to
go on a bumpy-ass ride.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.492
Mm.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.528
-You still a slut.
-(laughs)

21:01.628 --> 21:02.995
(refrigerator door opens)

21:03.029 --> 21:04.497
LUCIOUS: Ain't this a bitch.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.932
There ain't nothing sweet
in this damn house.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.601
(clatters)

21:10.202 --> 21:12.772
Walker's breast milk is
probably not the answer

21:12.872 --> 21:14.507
you're looking for.

21:17.176 --> 21:20.680
Um...you might try being

21:20.780 --> 21:22.649
a little sweeter to Cookie.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.150
I promise you, darling,

21:24.250 --> 21:28.555
this is not a fight
that you wanna pick sides with.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.559
Please, that's the last thing
I wanna do.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.065
Now, she'd never admit this
to you,

21:39.165 --> 21:41.233
but she missed you,
everybody did,

21:41.334 --> 21:42.835
especially Andre.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.206
And then you came back
like a tornado.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.043
I...I wasn't expecting that.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.312
Welcome to the Lyon pride.

21:54.847 --> 21:59.519
You know, Quincy's father was
a lot like you.

22:00.587 --> 22:04.491
He was headstrong,
yet sensitive.

22:04.591 --> 22:08.027
When he was hurt,
instead of talking to me,

22:08.127 --> 22:09.729
he lashed out.

22:09.829 --> 22:14.434
And he didn't mean to,
but he drove me away.

22:16.703 --> 22:20.607
Teri...

22:20.707 --> 22:23.876
I firmly believe
that Andre lucked out with you.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.045
Oh.

22:26.078 --> 22:29.682
But unlike Quincy's father,

22:29.782 --> 22:32.018
I'm one of a kind.

22:32.118 --> 22:35.021
(dramatic music)

22:35.121 --> 22:39.592
*

22:39.626 --> 22:42.194
(upbeat music)

22:42.294 --> 22:45.197
(cheers and applause)

22:45.297 --> 22:47.033
*

22:47.133 --> 22:49.969
Cookie,
thoughts on the Yoni craze?

22:50.069 --> 22:52.472
Well, this hot girl
likes to keep it cool

22:52.572 --> 22:54.240
down under in the summer,
honey.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.809
So all you girls out there
trying to sell

22:56.909 --> 23:00.747
this Yoni steam dream,
it was a nightmare, honey.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.048
(laughter)

23:02.148 --> 23:02.982
Can we please say a prayer

23:03.082 --> 23:04.417
for the real hot girl

23:04.517 --> 23:05.952
who's not having
such a hot time right now:

23:06.052 --> 23:07.620
My new fav, Tiana?

23:07.654 --> 23:09.422
I mean, between the Left
terrorizing her

23:09.522 --> 23:11.658
and this R&B star
who is cheating on her

23:11.758 --> 23:13.626
in a video that I cannot
take my eyes off of...

23:13.726 --> 23:15.261
Oh.

23:15.361 --> 23:17.797
So, let me
get this straight.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.499
So, you can do without
black people,

23:19.599 --> 23:22.869
but it's okay for you
to fantasize

23:22.902 --> 23:24.971
over the big, black--

23:25.071 --> 23:28.407
I hear that we have
a very special guest

23:28.508 --> 23:32.344
that's here to clear up
the Devon sex tape controversy.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.747
Oh, very special.

23:34.847 --> 23:38.250
Please welcome to Tea Talk
the founder of Empire,

23:38.284 --> 23:40.920
the legend himself,
Lucious Lyon!

23:41.020 --> 23:42.789
(exciting music)

23:42.889 --> 23:44.356
(cheers and applause)

23:44.457 --> 23:45.692
Morning, ladies.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.293
*

23:47.393 --> 23:49.295
SPECTATOR:
I love you, Lucious!

23:49.328 --> 23:50.429
How y'all doing?

23:50.530 --> 23:53.933
(cheers and applause)

23:54.033 --> 23:56.268
(tense music)

24:01.708 --> 24:02.975
Okay, let's get onto
our next hot chocolate--um,

24:03.075 --> 24:07.146
topic of the day,
and that is this sex tape.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.548
Is it a win for Devon?

24:08.648 --> 24:11.784
Um, what's a win for Devon
is this new single.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.620
It's an absolute win
for his fans.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.723
Well, I think it's a shame
that that boy's talent is being

24:16.823 --> 24:18.825
overshadowed by his pistol.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.326
(laughter)

24:20.426 --> 24:22.795
And it does cast
quite a shadow.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.565
(laughter)

24:25.665 --> 24:28.367
When he say it's not him,
I believe it's not him.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.703
Okay, well, then,
that makes me wonder

24:30.803 --> 24:32.471
who faked the video.

24:32.505 --> 24:35.975
Devon, baby,
if you're out there watching,

24:36.075 --> 24:40.312
you may wanna reconsider
the record company you keep.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.149
Speaking of company, Lucious,

24:43.249 --> 24:45.952
how is losing Tiana
affecting Empire?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.487
Artists do come and go
from labels.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.857
Oh, oh, no, no,
not superstars.

24:50.957 --> 24:54.426
See, Empire's loss is
definitely Bossy Media's gain.

24:54.527 --> 24:55.662
Oh!

24:55.762 --> 24:57.429
They are also a sponsor

24:57.530 --> 24:59.165
for the Cookie Lyon
Community Center Fundraiser

24:59.198 --> 25:00.166
I'm having this weekend.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.768
Yes!

25:01.868 --> 25:04.003
And I'm gonna stream live
nationwide.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.172
And I still haven't received
my invitation yet.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.507
Yes, and I'm waiting
for your donation.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.342
But I bought the damn place,
and without me,

25:10.442 --> 25:12.111
you wouldn't even have
the fundraiser.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.747
What you're not gonna do,
Lucious, is come up here

25:14.781 --> 25:17.449
and lay claim on my success,
right, ladies?

25:17.550 --> 25:18.785
ALL: Yes!

25:18.885 --> 25:20.019
COOKIE: You know how men
like to do that?

25:20.119 --> 25:21.387
Lift up their leg
like a little dog

25:21.487 --> 25:22.555
on a fire hydrant.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.290
That's the last thing
I'm trying to do.

25:24.390 --> 25:28.194
What I really wanna say
is that at that fundraiser,

25:28.227 --> 25:31.631
we're gonna have Devon perform
his single

25:31.731 --> 25:35.101
and 100% of the proceeds
will go directly

25:35.201 --> 25:37.303
to the Cookie Lyon
Community Center.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.772
(cheers and applause)

25:41.908 --> 25:44.276
That's a man.
That's a good man.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.545
Generous.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.485
It's just that Giselle
barely ever listens to me,

25:53.586 --> 25:55.521
and we disagree on everything.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.289
And who thinks that Tiana needs
to be

25:57.389 --> 25:58.591
the face of anything
right now?

25:58.691 --> 26:00.326
-For real.
-Okay, okay, all right, Becky.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.494
Did you not just see
what Lucious did to me

26:02.595 --> 26:04.296
on national television?

26:04.396 --> 26:05.898
Hmm?

26:05.998 --> 26:08.467
-Oh, my God, Cookie, I'm...
-COOKIE: Jeez.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.070
I'm so sorry.

26:11.103 --> 26:14.273
I came all this way.
Please focus on me.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.474
God.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.677
(exhales deeply)

26:17.777 --> 26:19.679
-Okay.
-Sometimes...

26:19.779 --> 26:21.147
All right, all right.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.315
So, you're freaking out,
'cause you're all in

26:23.349 --> 26:25.484
and this is all you got.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.788
Bossy is your dream, Becky.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.522
You can't give up
without a fight.

26:30.623 --> 26:31.691
I'm just saying, like,
am I wrong?

26:31.791 --> 26:33.592
Because we're
a brand-new label, okay?

26:33.693 --> 26:37.096
We need to be launching
fresh, new talent.

26:37.129 --> 26:40.032
Maybe I'm just not
cut out for this.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.501
If it's that easy
for you to walk away

26:42.601 --> 26:46.673
from your investment,
your sacrifices...

26:46.773 --> 26:48.607
then maybe the dream was
never yours

26:48.708 --> 26:50.142
in the first place, Becky.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.780
I really hate when you do this.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.181
What, tell the truth?

26:55.281 --> 26:57.850
-(laughs)
-Yes, exactly.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.121
I have the best idea.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.858
Let me help Tiana
on her road to recovery.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.828
Have her come and perform
at my fundraiser.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.664
Okay, but that sounds like
you think that I was wrong

27:11.764 --> 27:12.899
and that Giselle was right.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.068
Becky, do you wanna be right,

27:16.168 --> 27:19.005
or do you wanna be
a boss bitch?

27:21.173 --> 27:24.176
What exactly is stopping me
from being a right boss bitch?

27:25.377 --> 27:26.578
Okay, I'ma leave that with you.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.981
I'm wrong?

27:33.552 --> 27:34.854
Well, well, well.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.889
Hello, Lucious.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.858
Your little reunion
that you set up

27:38.958 --> 27:39.992
between me and Philly Street...

27:40.092 --> 27:41.227
Hmm?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.394
It really paid off.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.063
The brother's pen game
is tight,

27:44.163 --> 27:47.199
and so he's a producer
here now at Empire.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.035
Really?

27:49.135 --> 27:51.904
What's wrong, Trace?
You look stunned.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.339
Mm.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.374
You didn't cut Philly Street
from the script

27:55.474 --> 27:56.743
because of his pen game.

27:56.843 --> 27:57.744
(sighs)

27:57.844 --> 28:00.112
Something in this piss
ain't pure.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.949
You would know.
Yours never was, was it?

28:04.283 --> 28:06.185
And by the way,
if you're wondering,

28:06.285 --> 28:08.254
you're still not in the film.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.723
-(chuckles)
-(clicks tongue)

28:10.823 --> 28:13.692
I'm the mother of
your first-born child, Lucious.

28:13.793 --> 28:17.563
You can rewrite a script,
but you can't rewrite history.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.866
Well, we all know that.

28:19.966 --> 28:23.870
The winner always writes
history,

28:23.970 --> 28:26.538
and we agree that's me.

28:29.876 --> 28:33.245
(Lizzo's "Juice")

28:33.345 --> 28:38.885
*

28:38.985 --> 28:39.952
(laughs)

28:40.052 --> 28:42.254
Becky.
Okay.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.655
LIZZO: * Ain't my fault

28:43.756 --> 28:45.291
* That I'm out here
getting loose *

28:45.391 --> 28:47.393
* Gotta blame it
on the Goose *

28:47.493 --> 28:48.460
* Gotta blame it

28:48.560 --> 28:50.162
That video is BS.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.164
I would never play you
like that.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.066
I know you wouldn't.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.968
LIZZO: * I'm the pudding
in the proof *

28:56.068 --> 28:57.236
* Gotta blame it on my juice

28:57.269 --> 28:59.571
* Ya-ya-ee

28:59.671 --> 29:01.273
* Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee

29:01.373 --> 29:03.810
* Ya-ya-ee,
blame it on my juice *

29:03.910 --> 29:05.244
* Blame it, blame it
on my juice *

29:05.344 --> 29:07.579
* Ya-ya-ee

29:07.679 --> 29:09.615
* Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee

29:09.715 --> 29:11.784
* Ya-ya-ee,
blame it on my juice *

29:11.818 --> 29:13.152
* Blame it, blame it
on my juice *

29:13.252 --> 29:14.753
Right there.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.255
Oh, wow.
Tracy's here.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.656
Uh, uh, uh.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.291
-Keep it classy.
-Right.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.660
Tonight's about second chances.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.496
I thought NA meetings were
on Wednesdays.

29:24.530 --> 29:27.166
Really, Cookie?
You owe me.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.601
Take some singles, ladies.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.938
Let me talk to my friend Tracy
here.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.973
(both fake laugh)

29:34.073 --> 29:35.942
How long you gonna
hold that over me, huh?

29:36.042 --> 29:37.609
Besides,
that debt's been paid,

29:37.709 --> 29:39.578
or aren't you enjoying
running around Empire

29:39.611 --> 29:40.779
like you belong?

29:40.880 --> 29:43.515
Oh, honey,
can't we just get along?

29:43.615 --> 29:44.716
I mean,
we have so much in common.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.618
Just look at our past.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.821
Oh, no,
see, my past holds a husband

29:48.921 --> 29:50.556
and multimillion-dollar
music company.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.825
Your past holds a crack pipe--

29:52.859 --> 29:55.161
Uh, Tracy, it's so good
to see you again, honey.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.496
-You look gorgeous, gorgeous.
-Thank you.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.398
You know she just dropped
25,000 on a table, right?

29:59.498 --> 30:03.535
Oh, well, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.471
-She's at table three, correct?
-Mm-hmm.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.339
Carol will show you
to your table.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.141
-My apologies.
-Mm-hmm.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.911
Oh, and Snow White,

30:12.011 --> 30:13.545
don't get it twisted.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.414
You're not a major player here,
okay?

30:15.514 --> 30:17.416
You're just an addict
with money to blow.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.518
But we appreciate
your generosity.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.020
You look fabulous.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.089
One of our donors.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.190
This way, girl.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.658
*

30:26.758 --> 30:28.494
LIZZO: * It ain't my fault
that I'm out here *

30:28.594 --> 30:29.761
* Getting loose

30:29.862 --> 30:31.763
* Gotta blame it
on the Goose *

30:31.864 --> 30:33.900
* Gotta blame it on my juice,
baby *

30:33.933 --> 30:35.434
*

30:35.534 --> 30:37.436
Look at you.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.105
On point as always.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.339
Hmm.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.274
The more charm you throw,

30:42.374 --> 30:43.842
the more snake
I know you are.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.278
-What are you up to, Lucious?
-What's wrong?

30:46.378 --> 30:49.415
Can't I show some appreciation
to my beautiful wife

30:49.448 --> 30:51.017
and all the wonderful things
you've accomplished?

30:51.117 --> 30:53.085
I'm so proud of you.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.020
MAN:
Lucious, get an interview?

30:54.120 --> 30:55.554
No, thank you.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.791
Don't ruin tonight
with your petty games.

30:59.892 --> 31:02.394
Please, Lucious.
This is very important to me.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.464
I promise you,
tonight is all about you.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.267
Hmm.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.802
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lucious.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.908
(dramatic hip-hop music)

31:15.942 --> 31:18.710
*

31:24.483 --> 31:25.952
-You're walking too fast.
-Girl, I'm...

31:26.052 --> 31:27.954
Becky, what...

31:28.054 --> 31:30.856
Listen, I wanna apologize

31:30.889 --> 31:35.327
for letting my beliefs
get in between our business.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.396
I really don't wanna
fight with you no more.

31:37.496 --> 31:38.830
Well,

31:38.931 --> 31:39.765
me neither.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.233
Are we good?

31:41.333 --> 31:43.102
-Okay.
-Good.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.403
-COOKIE: Hey.
-Yeah, we're good.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.973
Ooh, Cookie, listen.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.241
Thank you for the lifeline
for the Tiana performance.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.609
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to pull her.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.144
What?

31:52.178 --> 31:54.981
Yeah, the people over there
in these T-shirts

31:55.081 --> 31:58.150
will act a fool and protest
if Tiana gets on that stage.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.819
Now, I can't have them
ruining my fundraiser.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.354
It's too important.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.355
Yeah, but we can't afford

32:03.455 --> 32:04.790
to have Tiana cancelled again.

32:04.890 --> 32:06.292
I am doing you a favor.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.459
We are live-streaming
this event.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.827
If that girl gets up
on that stage,

32:08.927 --> 32:10.862
the internet is gonna
crush her,

32:10.963 --> 32:11.830
and my center will suffer.

32:11.863 --> 32:14.433
I'm sorry.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.635
This has damn Lucious
written all over it.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.771
(dramatic music)

32:19.871 --> 32:26.712

32:32.451 --> 32:34.820

Welcome, everybody!

32:34.920 --> 32:38.057

-PARTYGOER: Cookie!

32:39.291 --> 32:40.626
Whoo!

32:40.659 --> 32:42.528
Do we have an incredible
performance for you tonight.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.964
Uh, no, ladies, it's not Devon.

32:46.065 --> 32:50.336
Please allow me to introduce
Empire's own Treasure.

32:50.436 --> 32:54.040

* Oh

33:01.680 --> 33:02.981
*

33:03.082 --> 33:04.516
* A story never change

33:04.616 --> 33:05.851
* When you keep it true

33:05.951 --> 33:07.553
* And people never take time

33:07.586 --> 33:09.388
* To read it through

33:09.488 --> 33:12.158
* And that's why I do
what I wanna do *

33:12.258 --> 33:14.093
* Do, yeah

33:14.193 --> 33:16.928
* Wish I knew then

33:17.029 --> 33:19.998
* What I know now

33:20.099 --> 33:23.001
* But then again

33:23.035 --> 33:26.505
* I'ma do what I want, yeah,
do what I want, yeah *

33:26.605 --> 33:30.209
* Whatever I choose, baby

33:30.309 --> 33:31.510
*

33:31.610 --> 33:35.714
* It's not up to you, baby

33:35.747 --> 33:37.083
* No, it's not up to you

33:37.183 --> 33:38.217
MAYA:
She's killing it.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.285
* I ain't thinking of you

33:39.385 --> 33:40.719
And the beat knocks
thanks to me.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.721
Babe, you won.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.891
(both laugh)

33:45.991 --> 33:50.496
* You, you, you

33:50.529 --> 33:52.631
* Talk less, don't say much

33:52.731 --> 33:55.967
* Live your life, your life

33:56.068 --> 33:57.103
* I'm good

33:57.203 --> 33:58.804
* You see me

33:58.904 --> 34:02.474
* Live your life, your life

34:02.574 --> 34:05.043
BACKUP SINGERS:
* I'm good, you see me

34:05.077 --> 34:07.579
* Live your life, your life

34:07.679 --> 34:10.882
* Ooh, whoa

34:10.982 --> 34:14.120
* 'Cause I ain't worried
'bout you *

34:14.220 --> 34:16.988
(cheers and applause)

34:21.560 --> 34:23.162
COOKIE: Yes!

34:24.563 --> 34:26.132
Let's give it up for Treasure.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.234
(cheers and applause)

34:28.334 --> 34:29.735
Whoo.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.238
Because of your belief
in second chances,

34:32.271 --> 34:34.473
this center will be able
to give women

34:34.573 --> 34:37.276
and girls at risk
a second opportunity

34:37.376 --> 34:41.347
in a world
that so often dismisses them.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.948
(applause)

34:43.048 --> 34:43.982
Mm-hmm.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.620
Truth is, I benefitted
from a second chance.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.623
(solemn music)

34:51.723 --> 34:53.459
So I know how valuable
they are.

34:53.559 --> 34:57.763
*

34:57.863 --> 34:58.930
Where's your father?

34:59.030 --> 35:00.466
He's not coming to see you
today.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.634
Bam.
(laughs)

35:02.734 --> 35:04.503
You are not a part
of my company.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.804
You're not wanted here.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.206
You're a ghetto rat.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.441
-You'll always be a ghetto rat.
-A ghetto rat?

35:09.541 --> 35:10.376
Don't you touch me.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.777
Empire was mine!

35:11.877 --> 35:14.480
You built this company
on my back.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.014
-(glass shatters)
-Oh, you a--

35:16.114 --> 35:17.316
(smacks thudding, gunshot)

35:17.416 --> 35:18.384
I can't take it anymore.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.051
(sobs)

35:20.152 --> 35:24.190
*

35:24.290 --> 35:26.925
I sold drugs for a man I loved.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.862
(crowd murmurs)

35:30.962 --> 35:34.400
And it was my $400,000
in drug money

35:34.566 --> 35:36.568
that started Empire...

35:36.668 --> 35:39.004
(crowd murmuring
indistinctly)

35:39.104 --> 35:40.972
Tell it, girl.

35:41.006 --> 35:43.542
And landed me
17 years in prison.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.877
-Ooh!
-Oop.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.215
The truth hurts.

35:49.315 --> 35:53.051
Ladies, please,
don't ever follow a man

35:53.151 --> 35:55.120
into a life of bad choices

35:55.153 --> 35:58.324
and sacrifices.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.692
*

36:00.792 --> 36:01.927
Thank you.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.562

That's right, Cookie!

(heels clicking)

36:28.987 --> 36:30.422
(Cookie sighs)

36:37.195 --> 36:40.065
I really hope you enjoyed

36:40.165 --> 36:41.900
making a mockery of me tonight.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.239
You signed an NDA, remember?

36:47.339 --> 36:50.742
So, sue me.

36:52.444 --> 36:55.314
Did you even consider

36:55.414 --> 36:58.083
what your little "truth"
would do to my legacy?

36:58.183 --> 37:00.619
Our  legacy is something

37:00.719 --> 37:03.289
I won't let you deny anymore.

37:03.389 --> 37:06.091
This is our  house, Lucious,

37:06.124 --> 37:10.262
our  Empire, our  legacy!

37:10.362 --> 37:11.897
You want truth?

37:11.997 --> 37:13.932
Well, I got some truth
for your ass.

37:14.032 --> 37:17.669
You violated a $4 million NDA,

37:17.769 --> 37:20.406
and I'm gonna sue you
for every damn penny you got.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.274
Come see me, Lucious.

37:22.374 --> 37:25.611
I sweat that much
on my day off, bitch.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.281
(grunts)

37:39.525 --> 37:42.661
You knew how important

37:42.761 --> 37:45.531
this fundraiser was for me,

37:45.631 --> 37:49.435
and you still couldn't put
Petty D away

37:49.468 --> 37:52.704
for the night.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.580
You resent me...

38:01.613 --> 38:02.948
(chuckles)

38:03.048 --> 38:06.284
Because I did this
all my myself,

38:06.385 --> 38:07.353
and you didn't.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.122
There it is:

38:11.222 --> 38:14.626
That little myth
you take so much pride in.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.228
What myth?

38:17.329 --> 38:21.166
That 17-year myth,
that $400,000 myth

38:21.266 --> 38:23.535
that you throw in my face
every time you get

38:23.635 --> 38:25.236
on your little high horse.

38:25.337 --> 38:28.507
That 400,000 was gone
within months

38:28.540 --> 38:30.241
after they locked your ass up.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.711
You're lying.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.212
I had to pay producers.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.382
I had to buy studio time.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.249
I didn't know what I was doing,
so I got raked

38:38.350 --> 38:42.788
by every damn vendor
that printed or packaged my CD.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.923
You weren't there to help.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.659
So within a matter of months,
I was broke.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.162
That is until Bunkie told me

38:51.262 --> 38:55.567
about how Philly Street...

38:55.667 --> 38:58.670
robbed banks in order to
fund his career.

38:58.704 --> 39:03.208
It was a genius idea;
shouldn't have told me that.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.377

"Shimmy Shimmy Ya")

39:05.477 --> 39:07.713
ODB: * Shimmy, shimmy, ya,
shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay *

39:07.813 --> 39:10.015
* Gimme the mic
so I can take it away *

39:10.115 --> 39:12.584
* Off on a natural charge,
bon voyage *

39:12.618 --> 39:15.020
* Yeah, from the home
of the Dodger Brooklyn squad *

39:15.120 --> 39:17.556
* Wu-Tang killer bees
on a swarm *

39:17.656 --> 39:19.558
* Rain on your college
disco dorm *

39:19.658 --> 39:20.792
(gunshot cracks)

39:20.892 --> 39:22.594
GUNMAN:
Everybody on the ground, now!

39:22.694 --> 39:23.729
-(shouts indistinctly)
-(grunts)

39:23.829 --> 39:24.730
What?
What?

39:24.763 --> 39:25.731
Shush up.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.198
Where the money at?

39:27.298 --> 39:28.967
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.602
(grunts)

39:30.702 --> 39:31.903
GUNMAN: Now you know
what I'm talking about?

39:32.003 --> 39:33.204
PHILLY STREET:
It's in the closet.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.372
GUNMAN:
Get your ass up and show me.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.042
(panting)

39:41.079 --> 39:42.714
I'm just--I'm going
for the money.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.819
(woman screams)

39:47.919 --> 39:50.822
(tense music)

39:50.922 --> 39:52.390
Soon as I find out
who under that mask,

39:52.424 --> 39:53.324
you getting rocked.

39:53.425 --> 39:54.493
You sure about that?

39:54.593 --> 39:55.927
(panting)

39:56.027 --> 39:58.764
(grunts)

39:59.931 --> 40:03.969
*

40:04.069 --> 40:05.403
Stay down!
Stay!

40:05.504 --> 40:06.772
Huh?
Huh?

40:06.805 --> 40:08.640
No!

40:08.740 --> 40:15.313
*

40:17.315 --> 40:20.251
(tires screeching)

40:20.285 --> 40:27.158
*

40:30.929 --> 40:35.000
Philly Street did 20 years

40:35.100 --> 40:39.705
for murdering the man
that he thought robbed him.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.675
Khalil.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.945
Yep.

40:47.045 --> 40:51.349
So it was the $1 million
that I stole from Philly Street

40:51.382 --> 40:55.053
that funded my first album.

40:55.153 --> 40:58.223
I built this, not you.

40:58.323 --> 41:01.993
So your 17 years
is nothing but a fantasy.

41:02.027 --> 41:06.364
And the 400,000
you put in...

41:06.464 --> 41:08.900
that meant less to Empire

41:09.000 --> 41:12.638
than you do to me now.

41:19.978 --> 41:24.349
So, you expect me

41:24.449 --> 41:28.687
to sit here and believe
Petty-ass D

41:28.787 --> 41:31.322
held on to this
all these years?

41:34.092 --> 41:36.194
(spoon clangs)

41:36.294 --> 41:38.263
(sniffles)

41:38.363 --> 41:40.699
You're lying.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.702
(bluesy piano music)

41:43.802 --> 41:45.303
(sniffles)

41:45.336 --> 41:51.943
*

41:52.043 --> 41:54.212
I don't believe you.

41:54.312 --> 41:58.183
The truth hurts,
don't it?

41:58.216 --> 42:00.451
*

42:00.552 --> 42:02.554
What you think
you about to do, huh?

42:02.654 --> 42:05.557
(keys jingle)

42:05.657 --> 42:09.628
*

42:09.728 --> 42:12.998
It really challenges
your manhood

42:13.031 --> 42:16.534
that I'm 100% that bitch
behind your legacy.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.469
(chuckles)

42:18.570 --> 42:22.040
Instead, you'd rather
fool yourself

42:22.140 --> 42:26.511
with that BS story...

42:26.544 --> 42:30.115
than face that...

42:30.215 --> 42:32.083
the truth.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.454
(objects clatter)

42:36.554 --> 42:40.592
*

42:40.626 --> 42:42.661
(sniffles)

42:42.761 --> 42:44.763
*

42:44.863 --> 42:47.065
(exhales)

42:47.165 --> 42:48.634
Klimt.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.969
*

42:51.069 --> 42:54.272
It's still ugly.

42:54.305 --> 43:00.511
*

43:00.612 --> 43:03.114
(crickets chirping)
