00:20.020 --> 00:22.022
[Michaela] <i>Previously on</i> Manifest...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.231
828 wasn't an accident.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.775
We're supposed to save
the passengers together.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.903
I should've never proposed so soon
after the accident. She's not ready.

00:28.903 --> 00:32.032
The driftwood really is
a surviving piece of Noah's Ark.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.992
All the data seem
to point us in that direction.

[Saanvi] <i>Today's earthquake was
in the center of all of these miracles.</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:40.290

00:40.290 --> 00:41.875
How could you do what you did?

00:41.875 --> 00:45.420
I didn't tell you to kidnap a child.
I didn't tell you to kill someone!

00:45.420 --> 00:47.213
- Am I the father?
- [Drea] Biologically.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.300
But whether or not
you wanna be an actual parent...

00:50.300 --> 00:51.760
[Jared] It's all I've ever wanted.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.970
Like it or not, Cal,
I'm here because of you.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.555
You're the biggest threat to the Lifeboat.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.891
[Olive] The peacock, goddess, Juno.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.436
June, Gemini, twins,
represents the number two.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.647
The year of the wood dragon
in the Chinese zodiac.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.608
[Ben] June 2nd, 2024.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.526
It's all connected.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.120
[Ben] Michaela!
You just missed another one.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.664
You're not paying attention
to what's in front of you!

01:21.664 --> 01:24.209
You're so obsessed
with what's right in front of you

01:24.209 --> 01:25.877
that you're not seeing what's over there!

01:25.877 --> 01:29.005
We're supposed to be collecting firewood,
not entire trees.

01:29.005 --> 01:32.008
What if there's magic there,
like <i>Tuck Everlasting</i>?

01:32.008 --> 01:34.385
Well, the only magic I'm interested in
is the s'mores we get

01:34.385 --> 01:36.221
if we collect more firewood
than Mom and Dad.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.224
Oh, you did not say anything
about s'mores!

01:39.224 --> 01:42.769
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
Uh, you head left, and I'll head right.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.563
Uh, exsqueeze me. Who made you captain?

01:45.563 --> 01:47.982
Logic made me captain, okay?

01:47.982 --> 01:49.442
I'm older. I'm better at planning,

01:49.442 --> 01:52.237
and I've been mapping out the areas
the entire time.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.740
Look, I've already found
more firewood than you.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.200
[woman laughs]

01:57.200 --> 01:59.702
I think you should both be captains.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.079
Mom!

02:01.079 --> 02:04.999
You both have different gifts,
and you're gonna be stronger together.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.586
And judging by the fact
that I have 35 pictures of birds

02:08.586 --> 02:10.171
and no firewood,

02:10.171 --> 02:13.258
I think you two have a pretty good shot
at winning those s'mores.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.510
- [chuckles]
- [mom] Here.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.595
Let me get a picture of my little birdies.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.640
- [camera clicks]
- [chuckles]

02:21.432 --> 02:24.352
If we're both captain,
I think we should make this official.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.771
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.606
- Give me your knife.
- [camera clicking]

02:33.653 --> 02:35.155

Happy Eve of Destruction.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.549
Oh, come on. Let's not even joke about it.

02:54.549 --> 02:58.219
Listen, there's been some panic
now that the Callings are gone,

02:58.219 --> 03:01.347
and it's been all I can do
to keep everyone that's still here calm.

03:01.347 --> 03:05.018
- What have you been telling them?
- [sighs] What I'm telling myself.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.521
It ain't over till it's over.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.027
[sniffing]

03:15.111 --> 03:15.945
What?

03:15.945 --> 03:18.656
Is that perfume, Benjamin Stone?

03:18.656 --> 03:20.825
Seriously? We're staring down
the end of the world,

03:20.825 --> 03:23.995
and you got nothing better to do
than to bust my chops?

03:23.995 --> 03:26.664
Oh no, I have a lot better to do,
but this is just more fun.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.210
- Stop!
- It's nice. It's good.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.753
[laughs]

03:31.753 --> 03:33.087
I can't believe it.

- [gasps] It worked!
- I know.

came back, and they were all awake.

Hi. Are you okay? Do you recall anything?

03:52.523 --> 03:54.692
- He only speaks Bulgarian.
- No, I knew that.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.986
Thanks for stepping in. We got it, TJ.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.071
Yeah, for sure.

Are you all right?

04:00.615 --> 04:03.201
Do you remember anything?
Anything at all from the glow?

04:03.993 --> 04:06.496
We were in a lab, military.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.499
Someone was doing experiments.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.167
And then we woke up here.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.505
None of them have any memories
between their time with the major and now.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.675
They were in a constant Calling
for five and a half years.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.551
Maybe they came back with something.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.887
Something that could help us survive
the next 24 hours.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.723
Even if they did know something,
it's gone now.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.530
[chuckles] No. Rage Against the Machine.

04:41.072 --> 04:44.033
I set the camera up yesterday
to record the experiments.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.160
I forgot to turn it off.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.954
Oh, let's see what we missed.

[mysterious music plays]

05:02.760 --> 05:03.678
Hey.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.055
Where'd you get that?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.349
Henry Kim.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.893
It's, like, the most powerful dragon.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.146
Like king of storms or something.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.817
I don't wanna drag you into my mess.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.362
I feel bad enough
that you're still in here, living with us.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.031
Come on, Cal.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.327
We are the original Gemini twins.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.748
We were together in the beginning,
and we'll be together in the end.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.417
I wish I could've grown up with you.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.296
When the plane disappeared,

05:39.047 --> 05:43.885
it felt like... like it took
both of our childhoods with it.

05:46.637 --> 05:51.642
I missed you so much, but I... I knew.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.227
I just felt it.

05:54.562 --> 05:58.191
That you were... That you were still alive.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.445
We may have lost time,

06:03.029 --> 06:05.406
but we never lost each other.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.327
So...

06:11.287 --> 06:13.414
now do you wanna tell your twin
what's going on?

06:13.414 --> 06:14.499
[chuckles]

06:16.834 --> 06:17.710
It's...

06:19.295 --> 06:20.713
it's a Calling I had.

06:21.756 --> 06:26.511
Two sapphires come together,
creating a star glowing so bright.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.681
I think it's how I'm supposed
to help save the world.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.267
What did Dad say?

06:34.769 --> 06:35.895
I haven't told him,

06:36.771 --> 06:39.440
because I haven't exactly
figured it out yet.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.942
Look.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.322
We are all in this together.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.618
And that... that's how
we're gonna figure this out.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.620
Together.

07:04.715 --> 07:08.261
- Okay, you're sure that's what that means?
- Two sapphires have to connect.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.889
- Cal, that means you and Angelina.
- There must be another way.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.516
The fate of the world
hangs in a balance.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.351
She's the only other person
with a sapphire.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.269
[Cal] But why her?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.938
Why would the divine
put me through some twisted test

07:18.938 --> 07:21.107
to reach out to the person
who hurt my family the most?

07:21.107 --> 07:24.402
No matter what Angelina's done,
we're still standing in spite of it.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.279
Now the Calling wants you to go to her.

07:27.780 --> 07:28.990
So go.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.783
Dad, I'm not sure.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.076
Cal.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.620
I know I told you before

07:34.620 --> 07:37.498
that I didn't think you were strong enough
to keep Angelina out, but...

07:37.999 --> 07:39.333
but I was wrong.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.921
The reason I think
you're connected to her is because

07:44.422 --> 07:48.050
I think you're the only one strong enough
to convince her to do something right.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.886
[emotional music plays]

07:49.886 --> 07:51.888
Cal, if this is a test,
you have to face it.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.723
If you're scared, just use that.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.977
So, now what?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.440
I guess I gotta see a girl
about a sapphire.

08:08.237 --> 08:11.657
Morning, Adrian.
You said you wanted to talk? I'm ready.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.286
But I am curious.
How'd you know where to find us?

08:16.871 --> 08:18.915
I ran into him
while I was out getting supplies.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.250
Guess I forgot to tell you.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.169
Guess you did.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.297
So, why are you here?

08:26.297 --> 08:28.216
I'm here to make amends.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.052
I spent months tracking down
everyone I can

08:31.052 --> 08:32.970
to apologize for the harm I caused.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.972
Families of victims
from the nightclub fire,

08:34.972 --> 08:36.182
people from the compounds.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.601
Weren't you afraid you'd get caught
running around like this?

08:39.185 --> 08:41.729
If we don't redeem ourselves,
the world will end.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.732
I'll risk my freedom
for the lives of all mankind.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.192
And now I'm here for you.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.195
I told you to find your angel.
You misunderstood my words.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.113
I don't need your apology.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.033
I'm an archangel sent by God.

[laughs]

08:57.370 --> 08:58.371
You're serious?

09:00.122 --> 09:02.708
God infused me with sapphire.

09:03.417 --> 09:07.004
I now have the power
of destruction and salvation.

- You were blaspheming. False prophet.

Poetic justice.
They kicked me out of their family,

09:19.809 --> 09:22.103
so I came back with my own family,

The con man and the false prophet.

You think the Death Date
isn't coming for you?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.159
No, I told you I'm special.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.619
Then prove it.

Can you make things levitate?

Can you read my mind?

- What actual power do you have?

About what?

10:01.642 --> 10:03.644
About us needing to work together.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.396
I had a Calling.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.897
Of you and me?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.482
[Cal] I should've known.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.695
This journey has always kept us connected
to one another.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.114
Even before we met,

10:16.073 --> 10:17.783
I didn't know what you'd look like,

10:17.783 --> 10:19.493
I didn't know how you'd sound,

10:19.493 --> 10:24.957
but I knew you had this enormous potential
for good, for kindness.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.584
I... I could feel it.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.961

for all the bad things you've done.

It's a chance to do good.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.203
What about the pain I've endured?

11:03.579 --> 11:06.540
Angelina, it's okay. This is a chance
for you to redeem yourself.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.543
I am the redeemer. God chose me!

11:09.543 --> 11:12.672
We're both chosen, but neither of us
are strong enough on our own.

Well, I'm not on my own anymore.

11:14.465 --> 11:18.219
I have a partner,
someone who loves me unconditionally.

11:18.219 --> 11:22.890
But only you and I have the sapphires.
We have a choice. We can save everyone.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.267
I don't wanna save everyone.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.144
The Death Date is a cleansing.

to stop it is to work with you,

24:30.177 --> 24:33.138
You tell Angelina about
that piece of Noah's Ark,

24:33.680 --> 24:35.223
you might save your ass.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.393
But you could doom everyone else.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.978
Thing is, Adrian...

24:42.898 --> 24:44.399
I really like my ass.

25:00.957 --> 25:04.044
All this time, I thought
throwing the ark away was a huge mistake.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.131
Maybe it was the exact right thing.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.842

25:15.055 --> 25:16.681
[voice breaking] You never gave up on me.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.601
All of you.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.355
You're my family.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.609

to get through this without you.

25:52.509 --> 25:55.136
What do you think
the fissure looking like my scar means?

25:55.136 --> 25:57.806
Well, if the Callings have taught me
anything by now,

25:57.806 --> 26:02.227
it's that we have to trust
that they'll reveal what we need to know

26:03.019 --> 26:04.271
when we need to know it.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.941
Yeah, I just hope when it does,
that I do what's needed.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.652
That it's enough. I'm enough.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.239
You're not a dragon.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.784
Or a savior or some Holy Grail.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.203
You're Cal Stone.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.581
[emotional music plays]

26:22.581 --> 26:26.001
You don't need a totem
to tell you that you're enough.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.629
You already are.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.095
I'm scared, Dad.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.097
I know, buddy.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.267
Me too.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.352
But we got each other.

26:53.653 --> 26:54.487
Hey.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.906
Hi. Can I ask you something?

27:01.077 --> 27:03.747
- What are you still doing here?
- Saving the world. What are you doing?

27:03.747 --> 27:06.833
- Don't think it's time to take a day off?
- What the hell are you talking about?

27:06.833 --> 27:07.917
Go to Florida.

27:08.710 --> 27:12.005
To Estelle, the boys.
Hug them, jump in the pool with them.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.048
Just go be with them.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.343
You've done enough to help me,
my family, the passengers,

27:16.343 --> 27:17.636
the whole world!

27:19.638 --> 27:21.181
You owe it to yourself. To them.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.228
Go.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.530
Guess this is goodbye, then.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.243
I prefer, "until next time."

28:02.347 --> 28:04.140
[Eagan] I need to tell you something.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.017
I'm leaving.

28:07.060 --> 28:07.894
What?

28:07.894 --> 28:10.355
[Eagan] Sorry.
I'd say, "It's not you. It's me."

28:10.355 --> 28:12.232
But it's totally you.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.900
[tense music plays]

28:13.900 --> 28:16.403
No! Eagan! Eagan, you're my husband.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.530
You promised to be by my side. I...

28:19.656 --> 28:20.740
I can save you.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.373
Turns out I'm willing to take a risk
that maybe I can save myself

28:28.373 --> 28:30.750
and a few others along the way.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.836
Consider this an annulment.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.629
You can't leave me!

28:35.964 --> 28:38.550
I am chosen, and I chose you!

28:40.009 --> 28:42.595
For once in my life,
I'm not taking the easy route.

28:43.638 --> 28:44.472
Sorry, Red.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.600
You've written your own death sentence!

28:48.184 --> 28:51.229
Tomorrow, you will die
slowly and horribly!

28:59.237 --> 29:00.947
You two are both in. And so help me,

29:00.947 --> 29:04.033
God will show me the ark
and punish those who betray me.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.247
Wanna make a wager
on who can collect the most firewood?

29:09.247 --> 29:11.541
You're the most competitive person
I know. Go!

- Chicken!

Ben.

29:26.431 --> 29:29.017
[chuckles] Oh my God.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.770
We carved that when we were kids.

29:31.770 --> 29:36.775
We were bird-watching with Mom and Dad,
and she wanted us to be cocaptains.

29:38.651 --> 29:39.694
It's like she knew.

29:41.070 --> 29:45.742
Like she was preparing us
for this journey, this moment.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.870
She was preparing us to lead...

29:51.289 --> 29:52.415
together.

29:54.542 --> 29:55.543
All good things.

29:56.544 --> 29:57.545
All good things.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.057
Damn, Drea. Look at this spread.

30:09.724 --> 30:13.645
Look, my mom's biggest nightmare
is running out of food at any function.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.646
Guess it rubbed off.

30:14.646 --> 30:18.191
Can't imagine a bigger nightmare
than your Death Date being tomorrow.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.108
[clears throat]

30:19.859 --> 30:23.112
[chuckles] Wow, TJ.
Way to bring the room down.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.825
Um, okay, Saanvi.
What are you gonna do on Monday?

30:26.825 --> 30:30.829
Monday, like, day after tomorrow Monday?
June 3rd, 2024 Monday?

30:30.829 --> 30:32.747
That's... That's the one.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.292
Oh, gosh. I hadn't thought about it,
but now that I'm being put on the spot,

30:36.292 --> 30:40.505
I guess I really wanna finish
my dissertation on pediatric cancer.

30:42.131 --> 30:45.176
Wow. And I thought finishing reading
<i>The Shining</i> was a lofty goal.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.386
[chuckles]

30:47.136 --> 30:50.014
I'm finally gonna beat Mick
at Bananagrams.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.267
- [Michaela] Dream on!
- [Jared] Yeah! Dream on is right!

30:52.851 --> 30:55.937
- I was thinking maybe I'd have a baby.
- Aw.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.313
Have you thought of a name yet?

30:57.313 --> 31:00.066
Yeah. Hope. It kind of just happened.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.902
And if genetics is any indication,

31:02.902 --> 31:05.572
this baby is going to be stubborn as hell.

31:06.531 --> 31:10.535
Well, as long as she has your ability
to build furniture, I'm good.

31:10.535 --> 31:14.205
And you're not too shabby of a listener.
So that'd be a bonus.

31:15.290 --> 31:19.919
Not to mention your strength,
resilience, loyalty.

31:22.922 --> 31:27.468
Well, with you two as parents,
that's gonna be one very lucky kid.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.512
[quietly] Thanks.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.307
All right, I think I'm gonna go lay down.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.310
I could use a little rest.
Tomorrow's a big day.

31:44.777 --> 31:48.948
Just used Drea's phone to check in on Dad.
He's doing quite well at Chez Vasquez.

[Olive laughs]

31:53.244 --> 31:55.455
You ever regret taking a later flight?

31:56.331 --> 31:57.248
I don't know.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.709
Life would've been a lot easier.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.962
But it also wouldn't have been
as eye-opening.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.425
I wouldn't have met a lot of people.
I wouldn't have met--

32:07.425 --> 32:08.468

32:10.678 --> 32:11.554

[emotional music plays]

32:13.222 --> 32:14.390
What about you?

32:14.390 --> 32:16.059
I would've gone with Grace.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.479
Then you wouldn't have had Eden.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.690
Somehow or another,
Eden would find a way to us.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.112
What's meant to be will be.

32:30.531 --> 32:31.407
Yeah.

- [Ben] Hey.

32:54.055 --> 32:58.351
We never really got much of a chance
to talk about...

32:58.935 --> 33:00.728
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:04.565 --> 33:05.483
You know...

33:08.277 --> 33:13.825
I never thought I'd be as close
to anyone in my life as I am to my family.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.330
But then you came into my life.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.042
And as great as last night was...

33:25.628 --> 33:27.964
I don't think I'll ever get over Grace.

33:32.802 --> 33:34.262
It's not fair to you.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.639
My heart's still with Alex.

33:38.433 --> 33:43.604
Even if we were to survive the Death Date
and nothing would change with her, but...

33:46.733 --> 33:48.943
I just still can't help but love her.

So you may not be my end game,
Ben Stone, but...

34:00.204 --> 34:02.248

All right, well,
here's to saving the world.

34:29.984 --> 34:33.321
You know, even if we do save the world
tomorrow, will anyone even know?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.449
Or will things just go back
to being how they were

34:36.449 --> 34:38.326
with us being locked up and hated?

34:38.326 --> 34:41.621
After all that we've done
in the past five and a half years...

34:43.581 --> 34:44.957
you think that's gonna be enough?

34:46.334 --> 34:47.168
I don't know.

34:47.752 --> 34:51.923
I don't know what goes on the scales
or what the divine wants from us.

34:52.715 --> 34:55.927
I just hope the good is enough
to outweigh the bad.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.682
But why us?

35:02.725 --> 35:04.560
Why Flight 828?

35:05.186 --> 35:07.522
Why did 827, 829 get a pass?

35:08.856 --> 35:13.194
My guess is
there isn't anything special about us.

35:13.194 --> 35:17.949
We're just a bunch of random people.
Some good, some bad.

A statistical sample

35:22.161 --> 35:23.913

35:24.455 --> 35:27.667
We always say it's all connected,
but the truth is

35:29.293 --> 35:32.964
we are all connected to each other.

Everyone in the world.

35:37.885 --> 35:38.845

35:39.470 --> 35:41.973
Might've been easier to walk off the plane
with a note that said,

35:41.973 --> 35:43.891
"Be good to each other, or else."

35:43.891 --> 35:44.934
[chuckles]

35:44.934 --> 35:46.269
Hmm.

35:46.269 --> 35:50.064
I don't think the Callings
forced us to do good.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.900
I think they gave us a chance
to choose it.

35:53.985 --> 35:58.072
And they tried to explain it
in the best way we would understand.

35:58.865 --> 36:02.451
Bottom line, we're all just
supposed to do our part.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.759
I think deep down,
I knew that you proposed

37:41.759 --> 37:44.720
because you really wanted
to help me through the Evie drama.

I saw the way you and Drea
looked at each other.

And I just... I knew.

that if you're being honest with yourself,

your heart wants and needs
to be with her too.

You know, your Aunt Mick and I
have been here before?

40:15.538 --> 40:17.498
Yeah. When we were kids.

40:18.290 --> 40:20.459
With Grandma Karen and Grandpa Steve.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.589
And why are you telling me this now?

40:25.589 --> 40:29.176
I totally forgot until Mick and I
went to look for firewood.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.432
Mom would always take us to campsites

40:34.432 --> 40:37.893
on one of her wacky bird-watching trips.

40:38.394 --> 40:42.398
There's gotta be hundreds of slides
tucked away in Beverly's attic somewhere.

40:42.398 --> 40:43.482
If only we--

40:43.482 --> 40:44.483
It's not if.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.404
It's when.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.198
When we survive this thing,

40:51.198 --> 40:54.201
we're gonna go through
every single one of those slides.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.287
Together.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.664
We're gonna make it, Dad.

41:00.374 --> 41:01.625
I just know it.

41:02.918 --> 41:04.753
My eternal optimist.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.592
You always find

41:10.801 --> 41:12.636
possibility and hope,

41:12.636 --> 41:16.140
even when everyone else
is ready to give up.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.853
I don't know how to thank you.

41:21.645 --> 41:27.276
You can thank me by taking me
to fly glider planes at Bethesda Fountain.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.117
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.094
It's all connected.

42:38.472 --> 42:39.640
Cal, what are you doing?

42:41.809 --> 42:42.977
I have to go, Dad.

42:43.602 --> 42:45.479
No, I'm not losing you again.

42:46.772 --> 42:47.940
[sobs] No.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.317
It's all right.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.362
You said it yourself.

42:54.196 --> 42:57.408
We all have to do our part,
and this is mine.

43:00.119 --> 43:04.206
My part to save the passengers,
to... to help tip the scales.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.585
There's gotta be another way.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.713
It's okay, Dad.

43:12.214 --> 43:14.008
I know what we need to do now.

43:15.175 --> 43:18.512
Please have faith in me... in all of this.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.474
I love you.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.146
Thank you for being my dad.

43:32.776 --> 43:33.861
[Ben] I love you.

43:36.405 --> 43:38.073
My beautiful boy.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.659
Love you always.

Dear Lord, I pray for your guidance.

Please, please tell me what to do next.
