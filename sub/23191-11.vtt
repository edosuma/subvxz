00:47.730 --> 00:49.864
It certainly has a unique frame, sir.

00:49.899 --> 00:51.866
I got it from home.

00:51.901 --> 00:53.868
It was a present from the mother-in-law.

00:53.903 --> 00:56.404
All I needed to do was remove
the atrocity that was in it.

00:56.438 --> 00:58.506
What is that, sir? Mahogany?

00:58.540 --> 01:00.441
Well, it's certainly one
of the more exotic woods.

01:00.475 --> 01:03.144
- Yes, it's too dark for teak.
- Why are the two of you

01:03.179 --> 01:05.313
talking about the frame
when it's the painting

01:05.346 --> 01:08.216
that merits attention? I think your use

01:08.250 --> 01:11.586
- of colour is extraordinary.
- You needn't flatter me, Doctor,

01:11.620 --> 01:13.588
but why exactly do you say so?

01:13.622 --> 01:15.556
With this painting,

01:15.591 --> 01:18.226
I see a creative vision taking hold.

01:18.316 --> 01:20.950
You seem to be capturing the
essence of the North woods

01:20.985 --> 01:22.952
and not just the actual of it.

01:22.987 --> 01:25.822
Well, it's not half bad for a copper.

01:25.856 --> 01:29.959
I'm curious, sir, why
did you use blue and...

01:29.994 --> 01:32.095
pink for the trees?

01:32.129 --> 01:35.431
Creative vision, Murdoch,
like Dr. Ogden just said.

01:35.465 --> 01:38.467
Oh, and I ran out of the green.

01:47.444 --> 01:49.445
George, look at this one.

01:49.479 --> 01:52.281
- He's put a few away already.
- Oh. He's coming right for us.

01:52.316 --> 01:54.950
Most drunks head the
other way when they see us.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.286
He's too pickled to know
if he's coming or going.

01:57.321 --> 02:00.388
Well, I'm off duty.

02:00.423 --> 02:02.424
Getting an early start today, sir?

02:02.458 --> 02:04.459
- Eagle...
- What's that?

02:04.493 --> 02:06.695
- Eagle?
- Eagle...

02:06.729 --> 02:09.231
- What?
- Eagle... flight.

02:09.264 --> 02:11.099
Sir, are you all right?

02:11.134 --> 02:14.636
Eagle...

02:14.670 --> 02:16.705
I can't make out what he's trying to say!

02:16.739 --> 02:19.641
I've... been... murdered.

02:19.675 --> 02:21.643
Sir?

02:21.677 --> 02:23.712
- Sir?!
- He's out cold, George.

02:25.914 --> 02:28.550
He's gone cold, Henry.

02:28.584 --> 02:31.219
He's dead.

02:39.904 --> 02:42.186
We thought he was just three
sheets to the wind, sir,

02:42.206 --> 02:43.307
then we realized he was
trying to tell us something.

02:45.043 --> 02:47.178
I've been murdered.

02:47.212 --> 02:50.881
- And then he died.
- Right at our feet, sir.

02:50.915 --> 02:53.650
Thank you, Henry. Doctor?

02:53.685 --> 02:55.686
Well, if we can consider the constables'

02:55.720 --> 02:58.922
account accurate, he may
well have died from a seizure.

03:00.858 --> 03:05.095
"Edward Graham. Surveyor
for the Timiskaming

03:05.129 --> 03:07.430
and Northern Ontario Railway."

03:07.465 --> 03:10.366
Sir, and his appointment
book has a meeting for today

03:10.401 --> 03:13.436
at 5 o'clock with C.A.M.

03:13.471 --> 03:17.140
at M.D. and A. I have no
idea what that could mean.

03:17.174 --> 03:18.975
Alright. Gentlemen,

03:19.009 --> 03:20.843
let's notify his next of kin.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.422
I can't imagine it, Detective.
He only just arrived home

03:33.456 --> 03:36.025
this morning, unexpected at that.

03:36.059 --> 03:39.962
He was so excited, so happy.

03:39.997 --> 03:42.998
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Graham.

03:43.032 --> 03:45.834
I understand your son was a surveyor.

03:45.868 --> 03:49.338
Yes. He was under contract
to the Ontario Government

03:49.372 --> 03:51.340
for the new northern railway.

03:51.374 --> 03:53.808
You say his visit was unexpected.

03:53.843 --> 03:56.178
Do you have any idea why
he returned to Toronto?

03:56.212 --> 03:58.246
I don't. All he told me

03:58.280 --> 04:00.381
was that our fortunes were about to change.

04:00.415 --> 04:02.884
- How so?
- He didn't say.

04:02.918 --> 04:05.687
He hurried right out to
take care of some business.

04:05.721 --> 04:09.557
He returned with a small parcel
and put it in his suitcase.

04:09.591 --> 04:12.127
- And then what happened?
- He was so happy.

04:12.161 --> 04:14.928
He took a drink to
celebrate, which surprised me,

04:14.963 --> 04:18.766
him knowing I don't approve.
I scolded him for that.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.767
Oh, dear Lord,

04:20.802 --> 04:22.803
my last words to him were in anger.

04:22.837 --> 04:25.306
Mrs. Graham, what time
would this have been?

04:25.340 --> 04:28.543
Around midday, I believe.

04:28.577 --> 04:31.244
Hmm...

04:31.279 --> 04:34.948
Um, I wonder if any of these abbreviations

04:34.983 --> 04:36.950
mean something to you.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.252
"M.D. and A."

04:39.287 --> 04:41.722
That could very well be
Murphy's Dining and Ale house

04:41.756 --> 04:45.258
just down the road. Edward
liked to socialize there.

04:45.293 --> 04:47.260
And C.A.M.?

04:47.295 --> 04:49.596
I couldn't say.

04:49.630 --> 04:51.831
Thank you.

04:51.865 --> 04:54.967
Just one final question, Mrs. Graham.

04:55.002 --> 04:58.438
What does "eagle flight" mean to you?

04:58.472 --> 05:00.907
Nothing at all.

05:00.941 --> 05:04.376
Detective!

05:04.411 --> 05:07.213
- Doctor.
- The only physical evidence

05:07.247 --> 05:10.083
I've found is a venous
congestion of the brain.

05:10.117 --> 05:13.485
I am inclined to believe
he may have been poisoned.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.788
Doctor, have you the
flask that Mr. Graham had

05:15.823 --> 05:17.824
- in his possession?
- I do.

05:19.826 --> 05:22.361
According to his mother,

05:22.395 --> 05:24.363
Mr. Graham took a drink,

05:24.397 --> 05:26.832
presumably from this flask.

05:26.866 --> 05:29.401
Whiskey. Approximately one hour

05:29.436 --> 05:32.304
prior to collapsing dead
on the Station House steps.

05:32.339 --> 05:34.406
There are a number of poisons

05:34.441 --> 05:37.142
that could manifest the
same way as in Mr. Graham.

05:37.176 --> 05:39.477
I'll endeavour to determine which one was

05:39.511 --> 05:42.547
- put into his whiskey.
- Thank you.

05:49.922 --> 05:52.490
So Graham came here because he
knew that he'd been poisoned?

05:52.524 --> 05:54.492
Why didn't he go to the hospital?

05:54.526 --> 05:56.661
Well, sir, if he believed
he'd been poisoned,

05:56.695 --> 05:58.663
perhaps he wanted to alert the authorities?

05:58.697 --> 06:01.399
What's this "eagle flight"?

06:01.433 --> 06:03.801
The last words that Graham
uttered before his death.

06:03.835 --> 06:05.836
You know, Murdoch, that
makes perfect sense.

06:05.871 --> 06:08.139
There's a brand of whiskey
called Eagle's Flight.

06:08.173 --> 06:11.475
Horrible stuff! He was
obviously trying to tell

06:11.509 --> 06:16.613
- Crabtree how he'd been poisoned.
- Sir, I believe you may be right. Hmm!

06:16.648 --> 06:21.318
- Oh, well.
- Sirs, Mr. Graham's suitcase.

06:21.352 --> 06:23.287
Thank you, George.

06:23.321 --> 06:25.289
It's locked. Do you have a key?

06:25.323 --> 06:27.791
No, sir. Mrs. Graham didn't have the key.

06:27.825 --> 06:30.761
However, if you'll allow me...

06:30.795 --> 06:34.598
Let the dog see the rabbit.

06:34.632 --> 06:37.501
Thinking of a change of profession?

06:37.635 --> 06:40.870
No, sir. Just trying to hone my skills.

06:40.905 --> 06:43.173
- Oh.
- I've almost got it there now.

06:43.207 --> 06:45.374
- Crabtree, move it.
- Sir, I've almost got it.

06:45.409 --> 06:47.610
Move!

06:49.880 --> 06:54.417
- There you go.
- I softened it up for you.

06:54.451 --> 06:57.453
Hmm... Well, there doesn't seem to be

06:57.487 --> 06:59.422
anything of any importance.

06:59.456 --> 07:01.924
Graham's mother did say that
he stowed something in here.

07:03.927 --> 07:06.595
Just a moment, sir.

07:06.630 --> 07:10.466
The outer dimensions of the
case appear to be much larger

07:10.500 --> 07:13.202
than the inner ones.

07:13.236 --> 07:15.737
Sir, a secret compartment, perhaps?

07:15.771 --> 07:18.106
I love a secret compartment.

07:20.643 --> 07:23.912
Not so secret anymore.

07:25.514 --> 07:28.650
A hand-drawn map. Likely of the area

07:28.684 --> 07:31.419
Graham had been surveying for
the Northern Ontario railway.

07:31.454 --> 07:33.822
Look what we have here.

07:33.856 --> 07:35.857
Sirs, this is what Mr. Graham
must have been talking about

07:35.891 --> 07:38.660
when he said their "fortunes
were going to change."

07:38.694 --> 07:40.928
Or perhaps it was money
he was planning to use

07:40.963 --> 07:44.899
in his upcoming meeting with C.A.M.

07:55.427 --> 07:57.395
Edward Graham?

07:57.429 --> 07:59.797
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

07:59.831 --> 08:02.300
Constabulary? What's this about?

08:02.334 --> 08:05.035
Sir, Mr. Graham is dead.

08:05.069 --> 08:06.937
What?

08:06.971 --> 08:09.873
But I was to have met him here today.

08:09.908 --> 08:12.709
- Yes. And you are?
- My name is Charles Arthur McCool

08:12.744 --> 08:15.746
- MP for the Nipissing Region.
- C.A.M.

08:15.780 --> 08:18.248
- You're a member of Parliament?
- Indeed, sir.

08:18.282 --> 08:20.350
Hurry up, children! This way!

08:20.384 --> 08:22.352
What was Mr. Graham's business with you?

08:22.386 --> 08:25.322
Oh, I do not know. I've never met the man.

08:25.356 --> 08:27.757
But you agreed to a meeting with him?

08:27.791 --> 08:30.626
Well, I knew him by name!
He wrote a report that led

08:30.661 --> 08:33.996
to a change in the route
of the Timiskaming railway.

08:34.030 --> 08:36.131
- What was this change?
- Well, he proposed that a run

08:36.167 --> 08:38.534
due north of North Bay to Dymond

08:38.568 --> 08:41.169
instead of along Lake
Timiskaming to Haileybury.

08:41.203 --> 08:43.573
- And you supported that?
- I took his advice!

08:43.607 --> 08:47.109
Were you expecting recompense?

08:47.143 --> 08:49.178
Exactly what are you insinuating?

08:49.212 --> 08:51.614
Sir, Mr. Graham was found

08:51.648 --> 08:54.383
with a great deal of
money in his possession.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.285
Bribery?! How dare you accuse me

08:56.319 --> 08:58.454
- of such chicanery?!
- I'm simply trying

08:58.488 --> 09:02.657
- to ascertain the facts.
- I will have you know that I have never...

09:02.692 --> 09:05.260
I have never accepted
so much as one red cent

09:05.295 --> 09:06.648
of dirty money.

09:06.749 --> 09:10.244
Again, what was Mr. Graham's
business with you, then?

09:10.252 --> 09:13.835
I am as curious as you, Detective.

09:18.841 --> 09:22.176
I believe the poison was
put into the victim's flask.

09:22.211 --> 09:25.714
But any odour and taste is masked
by the cheapness of the whiskey.

09:25.748 --> 09:27.781
So you can imagine the
difficulty I'm having.

09:27.816 --> 09:29.783
I'd be happy to help.
Poisons have always been

09:29.818 --> 09:31.819
- a particular interest of mine.
- Excellent! I ordered

09:31.853 --> 09:33.821
a new nest of rats to
help with the testing.

09:33.855 --> 09:36.424
- When do we start?
- Well, they arrive tomorrow.

09:39.628 --> 09:42.796
Do you have a hidden talent I'm unaware of?

09:42.831 --> 09:47.067
I don't, but I know someone who does.

09:47.101 --> 09:49.436
Provincial records show
that one Harold Richmond

09:49.470 --> 09:51.972
bought great tracts of land
in and around Haileybury.

09:52.007 --> 09:54.107
The original proposed
terminus for the railway line.

09:54.142 --> 09:56.143
Where might we find this Mr. Richmond?

09:56.177 --> 09:58.178
His residence is listed in Haileybury.

09:58.212 --> 10:01.281
Haileybury is where Mr. Graham
had been staying while surveying.

10:01.315 --> 10:04.151
- Perhaps they knew one another?
- Richmond would have lost

10:04.185 --> 10:06.619
a lot of money after Graham
changed the proposed routes

10:06.654 --> 10:08.522
of the railway. Right then.

10:08.556 --> 10:11.691
Pack your bags. You two
are off to Haileybury.

10:17.464 --> 10:20.499
Watch the trunk!

10:20.534 --> 10:23.102
- What have you there, George?
- My pillow, sir.

10:23.136 --> 10:25.104
There will be pillows in Haileybury.

10:25.138 --> 10:27.139
Yes, but this is my pillow,
sir. I can't sleep a wink

10:27.174 --> 10:30.043
without it. I discovered that
on our trip to Newfoundland.

10:30.077 --> 10:32.946
You realize we'll be trekking
through the woods, George?

10:32.980 --> 10:35.948
Yes, exactly, sir. All the
more reason to bring it.

10:35.982 --> 10:37.983
- Ah.
- All aboard

10:38.017 --> 10:40.252
to North Bay and points beyond!

10:57.285 --> 10:59.021
Sir, the only time I've been up this way

10:59.056 --> 11:01.223
before was to visit my Aunt Nettle.

11:01.258 --> 11:02.525
Not nearly as exciting as this trip.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.829
George, you do not have
an aunt in Haileybury?

11:06.863 --> 11:10.098
Well, not anymore, sir. She
moved back to Newfoundland.

11:10.132 --> 11:12.100
- Why?
- She couldn't stand

11:12.134 --> 11:14.102
the mainland, sir. Terrified of moose.

11:14.136 --> 11:16.304
Excuse me. Pardon me.

11:16.339 --> 11:19.374
Pardon the disruption, gentlemen.

11:19.408 --> 11:21.910
- Jagger Brown's the name.
- Uh, Crabtree,

11:21.944 --> 11:23.911
George Crabtree. This is
Detective William Murdoch.

11:23.945 --> 11:26.914
A detective. Well, I'll have
to mind myself then, mustn't I?

11:26.948 --> 11:28.850
I'm a prospector.

11:28.884 --> 11:31.118
It's not an easy life, but
if you know your way around

11:31.152 --> 11:33.120
a claim, you can make one heck of a living.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.923
- What are you searching for?
- Oh, Detective,

11:35.957 --> 11:38.192
the true prospector is not out in search

11:38.226 --> 11:40.160
of one single substance.

11:40.195 --> 11:43.597
Nay, the prospector roams
like the hunter of the plains,

11:43.631 --> 11:46.901
waiting until his prey
is discovered to strike.

11:46.935 --> 11:49.236
You're no prospector,
you're a damn greenhorn.

11:49.271 --> 11:51.571
Excuse me?

11:51.606 --> 11:54.441
- What's a greenhorn?
- A gink

11:54.475 --> 11:56.476
who thinks he knows
something about prospecting.

11:56.511 --> 11:59.078
They shouldn't let the
likes of you out of the city.

11:59.113 --> 12:03.216
Excuse me, but regardless
of experience, I believe

12:03.250 --> 12:06.286
everyone has an equal right to
prospect as he wishes, Ma'am.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.755
Don't call me that. The name's Mack.

12:08.790 --> 12:11.991
Oh! My apologies, Mack.

12:12.026 --> 12:15.295
I wonder, when we reach the
end of the line, could you

12:15.329 --> 12:18.798
- direct us to Haileybury?
- Yeah, you can tag along.

12:18.832 --> 12:22.001
You haven't said much.

12:22.036 --> 12:24.938
Strong, silent type.

12:24.972 --> 12:27.173
- Oh!
- I like that in a man.

12:27.207 --> 12:28.207
Well...

12:39.753 --> 12:41.821
Inspector, I took the liberty of entering

12:41.855 --> 12:43.756
your painting into an amateur competition

12:43.790 --> 12:45.758
at the Littlewood Gallery.
I'm sure it will be

12:45.792 --> 12:47.792
well received. Julia.

12:56.336 --> 12:59.071
- Stand down, Doctor.
- I see you found my note.

12:59.105 --> 13:01.473
- I did, and I forbid it.
- I really feel

13:01.507 --> 13:03.508
you're overreacting. Your
painting is quite lovely.

13:03.542 --> 13:06.077
Any fool can see that my
painting doesn't belong

13:06.111 --> 13:08.746
on a wall with the likes of
these. I mean, look at them!

13:08.781 --> 13:10.815
- Even the leaves are perfect!
- What does that matter?

13:10.850 --> 13:13.284
You have just as much
right to share your efforts

13:13.318 --> 13:14.853
with the public. I
don't see the harm in it.

13:14.887 --> 13:17.822
The harm, Doctor, is
that I will be humiliated.

13:17.857 --> 13:19.623
- I wish I could convince you.
- Well, you can't.

13:19.657 --> 13:21.625
I couldn't help but overhear.

13:21.659 --> 13:24.061
I must say, I agree with the lady.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.297
Who are you? Are you a painter?

13:26.331 --> 13:29.400
Why, yes. I... I painted
this sign right here.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.203
But I'm also a student of art.

13:32.237 --> 13:34.505
Your painting is the best I've seen so far.

13:37.174 --> 13:39.342
- Are you having me on?
- Not at all.

13:39.377 --> 13:41.344
Yours is the only original

13:41.379 --> 13:43.480
- of the bunch.
- That's very nice of you, young man.

13:43.515 --> 13:46.349
Unfortunately, the inspector
seems to have made up his mind...

13:46.384 --> 13:48.418
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses, Doctor.

13:50.161 --> 13:53.130
Perhaps I should share my
efforts with the public.

13:53.164 --> 13:55.999
So you will accept his
critique but not mine.

13:56.033 --> 13:59.770
I've always been a big
believer in consensus, Doctor.

14:06.177 --> 14:08.145
Yeah, that's fine there.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.585
Sir.

14:15.619 --> 14:17.853
Sir, you've no tie or collar.

14:17.888 --> 14:20.608
- No need, George.
- This here's our guide.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.239
There aren't enough horses for all of us,

14:22.246 --> 14:25.795
but a couple of donkeys
should do the trick.

14:52.755 --> 14:55.824
There we are. Leave it to the
Newfoundlander to catch a fish.

14:55.858 --> 14:58.159
Excellent work, George!

14:58.194 --> 15:00.161
Perhaps you could gut it,
sir, as were I caught it.

15:00.195 --> 15:01.286
These ought to sweeten it right up.

15:01.287 --> 15:03.791
Who would have thought you'd
find wild parsnips in these parts?

15:03.795 --> 15:07.235
- You don't want to be doing that.
- What? They're just parsnips.

15:07.269 --> 15:09.570
Those are not parsnips; that's kaagaaiminj.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.672
Kaga... Excuse me?

15:11.707 --> 15:14.742
Kaagaaiminj. That's
Algonquin for water hemlock.

15:14.776 --> 15:18.145
Highly poisonous. It can
be identified by the vein

15:18.179 --> 15:20.314
travelling inward to the notch of the leaf.

15:20.349 --> 15:22.750
You know Algonquin?

15:22.784 --> 15:25.486
Oh, a bit. Enough to trade.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.555
I was a lumberjack a long time ago.

15:30.091 --> 15:33.493
Say, did you happen to guide
a man named Edward Graham

15:33.527 --> 15:36.763
last Tuesday, travelling
from Haileybury to the train?

15:36.797 --> 15:39.366
I guide many people. I don't ask names.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.801
Over here, Georgie.

15:41.836 --> 15:44.137
Let's gut that fish together.

15:52.680 --> 15:56.816
Sir!

15:56.851 --> 15:59.051
Sir, do you hear that?

15:59.086 --> 16:02.489
Wolves, George. Miles away.

16:02.523 --> 16:05.258
Miles away?

16:07.261 --> 16:10.029
Very good.

16:12.332 --> 16:14.767
Sir, that wasn't miles
away, did you hear that?

16:14.801 --> 16:18.404
It's probably raccoons, George.

16:18.438 --> 16:21.373
Raccoons, oh.

16:21.408 --> 16:23.375
Sharp teeth though, sir.

16:23.410 --> 16:25.511
And ornery, raccoons.

16:29.215 --> 16:32.951
Oh, what was that?!

16:32.985 --> 16:35.120
It's nature, George,

16:35.154 --> 16:37.122
nothing more than that. Just nature.

16:37.156 --> 16:39.124
Nature.

16:39.158 --> 16:41.960
Well, I'm not sure I care for it.

16:44.463 --> 16:47.799
Make sure you get that ready.

17:20.298 --> 17:22.465
Thank you.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.501
I wonder if you happen

17:24.535 --> 17:26.803
to know a Mr. Harold Richmond?

17:26.838 --> 17:29.372
Everybody around here knows Richmond.

17:29.406 --> 17:31.775
- Keeps me in business.
- He frequents the inn?

17:31.809 --> 17:34.139
Regularly. He'll likely be in later,

17:34.140 --> 17:35.340
strutting about the place like a peacock.

17:35.713 --> 17:39.349
And another man. Edward Graham,

17:39.383 --> 17:42.085
- do you know him?
- Sure. He keeps a room here.

17:42.119 --> 17:44.854
Oh! I'll be needing his key as well.

17:44.888 --> 17:48.291
- No.
- Sir, Mr. Graham is dead.

17:48.325 --> 17:52.195
I am a police detective
investigating his murder.

17:52.229 --> 17:54.230
I demand you relinquish that key at once.

17:54.264 --> 17:57.200
You pay his bill, you get his key.

17:57.234 --> 17:59.302
How much does he owe?

17:59.336 --> 18:01.370
26 dollars and 37 cents.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.742
Sir, what if we get caught?

18:07.777 --> 18:09.912
We don't have 26$.

18:09.946 --> 18:12.181
Well, nor do we have the
authority to break and enter.

18:13.883 --> 18:16.418
Excellent work.

18:22.758 --> 18:24.726
Sir, is this surveying equipment?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.028
Yes, George.

18:29.231 --> 18:31.633
The drawer is locked, sir.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.035
That shouldn't be a
problem for you, George.

18:36.705 --> 18:39.073
This is all prospecting equipment.

18:39.107 --> 18:41.175
Not uncommon to find in these parts.

18:46.748 --> 18:48.916
Got it, sir.

18:51.553 --> 18:54.888
That's odd, it's empty.

19:02.930 --> 19:04.931
I wonder...

19:13.474 --> 19:16.576
What does it mean?

19:16.610 --> 19:19.079
- I have no idea.
- A code of some sort?

19:19.113 --> 19:21.248
It's possible.

19:21.282 --> 19:23.383
But without knowing the orientation

19:23.417 --> 19:25.385
or knowing what these symbols mean,

19:25.419 --> 19:27.787
it's impossible to know what
Mr. Graham was recording.

19:27.821 --> 19:30.256
Well, sir, that symbol looks like the moon.

19:30.290 --> 19:33.626
And that's the symbol for man.
Do you suppose he could have...

19:33.660 --> 19:35.795
No, George. I don't suppose that Mr. Graham

19:35.829 --> 19:37.830
had encountered moon men.

19:39.832 --> 19:42.834
Um, I was thinking more along
the lines of astronomy or...

19:42.869 --> 19:44.870
- Oh.
- Either way, sir,

19:44.905 --> 19:47.139
it must be important. Otherwise
why would he have hid that map

19:47.173 --> 19:49.574
in his suitcase and these
symbols locked away in a drawer?

19:49.609 --> 19:52.444
Indeed, George. Right.

19:52.478 --> 19:55.414
Lock these away in your
room and meet me downstairs.

19:55.448 --> 19:57.416
We need to speak with Harold Richmond.

19:57.450 --> 19:59.418
Sir.

20:06.626 --> 20:10.028
Yes, I knew Graham.

20:10.062 --> 20:12.030
I couldn't stand that bastard

20:12.064 --> 20:14.532
and I'm not sorry he's dead.

20:14.566 --> 20:17.335
Why is that?

20:17.369 --> 20:19.837
I staked my fortune

20:19.871 --> 20:22.506
on the land all around Haileybury.

20:22.541 --> 20:24.508
The railroad was supposed to end right here

20:24.543 --> 20:27.745
so I bought up everything that
wasn't on the Indian reservation,

20:27.779 --> 20:31.649
then that lunatic Graham
had the line rerouted.

20:31.683 --> 20:33.818
Why does that make him a lunatic?

20:33.852 --> 20:36.186
Because it makes no sense.

20:36.220 --> 20:37.254
Look, either Graham

20:37.288 --> 20:40.458
was an incompetent
surveyor or a lying thief

20:40.492 --> 20:42.927
who falsified his reports
for his own purposes.

20:42.961 --> 20:44.995
- What purposes would those be?
- I don't know,

20:45.029 --> 20:47.297
but I've hired my own
surveyors to find out.

20:47.332 --> 20:50.167
Mr. Richmond, is there anybody
who can confirm your whereabouts

20:50.201 --> 20:53.736
- for Thursday evening past?
- No. I was at home.

20:53.771 --> 20:56.139
I haven't been in Toronto in
months if you're asking that.

20:56.174 --> 20:58.508
And when did you last see Edward Graham?

20:58.542 --> 21:01.178
I'm not sure, some weeks
ago. Are you accusing me

21:01.212 --> 21:03.613
- of killing him?
- Did you?

21:03.647 --> 21:06.783
Ha! Of course not.

21:06.817 --> 21:08.852
I didn't get rich by being stupid.

21:08.886 --> 21:11.354
Alright, do you know of
anyone else who may have been

21:11.388 --> 21:13.690
upset with Mr. Graham?

21:13.724 --> 21:16.693
He would know.

21:18.428 --> 21:22.164
It's Frank Gowdy. He
was Graham's assistant.

21:24.667 --> 21:27.169
Dead?

21:27.204 --> 21:29.338
Dear Lord! How?

21:29.373 --> 21:31.974
This's what we're trying to ascertain.

21:32.009 --> 21:34.643
Do you have any idea why Mr.
Graham traveled to Toronto

21:34.677 --> 21:37.245
- earlier this week?
- He didn't say.

21:37.279 --> 21:39.214
He left quite suddenly. I assumed

21:39.248 --> 21:43.018
it was a personal matter.
He had family in the city.

21:43.052 --> 21:46.722
- Did he have any enemies you know of?
- Haha! More than a few.

21:46.756 --> 21:49.424
A lot of people were counting
on that railway coming through.

21:49.458 --> 21:52.260
Any of them that may have wished him dead?

21:52.294 --> 21:54.262
Harold Richmond, I'm sure.

21:54.296 --> 21:58.099
And there was a woman
that he used to, uh... see.

21:58.134 --> 22:01.269
Terribly jealous. Mad as
a wildcat when he left her.

22:01.303 --> 22:03.104
She even followed him down to Toronto.

22:03.139 --> 22:05.640
- But she lives here?
- She's drinking

22:05.674 --> 22:07.608
right there at the end of the bar.

22:17.485 --> 22:19.420
There he is.

22:19.454 --> 22:21.556
My big, strong copper.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.591
Miss... Mack.

22:23.625 --> 22:27.827
- I wasn't talking about you.
- I understand that you were

22:27.862 --> 22:30.931
in an intimate relationship
with Mr. Graham.

22:30.965 --> 22:33.400
- So?
- Well, I regret to inform you

22:33.435 --> 22:37.271
that Mr. Graham was recently
found dead. Murdered.

22:37.305 --> 22:39.039
Well, uh...

22:39.074 --> 22:41.074
I didn't do it.

22:41.108 --> 22:43.076
So, George, what about a drink?

22:43.110 --> 22:45.779
- You were in Toronto.
- No flies on you, eh?

22:45.813 --> 22:48.048
- We were on the train together.
- I also understand that

22:48.082 --> 22:50.584
Mr. Graham had recently
parted ways with you.

22:50.618 --> 22:52.852
I don't know what you heard,

22:52.887 --> 22:56.590
but I parted ways with
him. And none too soon.

22:56.624 --> 22:58.524
George, a drink?

22:58.559 --> 23:02.661
Perhaps another time... Mack.

23:02.696 --> 23:06.031
Sir, her manners could use some refinement

23:06.066 --> 23:08.734
to be sure, but do you think
she actually killed the man?

23:08.768 --> 23:11.003
She did not seem at all
seem surprised at the news

23:11.037 --> 23:13.038
of Mr. Graham's murder.

23:13.073 --> 23:15.140
And George,

23:15.174 --> 23:19.044
poison is traditionally a woman's weapon.

23:19.079 --> 23:23.381
Excuse me, would I be
able to borrow this board?

23:23.416 --> 23:26.551
- You will be bring it back?
- Yes.

23:42.767 --> 23:45.603
Even a small drop of the
liquid from Graham's flask

23:45.637 --> 23:47.605
was enough to kill this rat.

23:47.639 --> 23:50.273
There's no burning of the mucous membranes,

23:50.307 --> 23:52.342
so we can rule out arsenic, cyanide,

23:52.376 --> 23:54.711
- strychnine.
- I activated carbon

23:54.746 --> 23:57.313
I made from ground nutshells
and gave it to this rat.

23:57.348 --> 24:00.951
- He's still alive.
- So the poison is not a strong acid.

24:00.985 --> 24:05.188
We should also rule out alkali, iron...

24:05.222 --> 24:07.390
lithium, ethanol and the like...

24:07.424 --> 24:10.326
leaving us with a multitude of
plant-based poisons to consider.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.629
The rat is still in metabolic acidosis.

24:12.663 --> 24:15.298
Have you considered
treating it with an antidote

24:15.332 --> 24:18.134
- of sodium bicarbonate?
- Of course.

24:18.169 --> 24:20.570
If the rat responds, it would
narrow down the type of plant.

24:20.604 --> 24:22.905
Thank you.

24:24.507 --> 24:28.243
Come here, little fella. Let's
see if we can make you better.

24:28.278 --> 24:32.214
Harold Richmond admits to
wanting Edward Graham dead.

24:32.248 --> 24:34.850
He would have lost a potential fortune

24:34.885 --> 24:36.585
with the rerouting of the railway.

24:36.619 --> 24:39.555
- Mr. Gowdy?
- No apparent motive, although

24:39.589 --> 24:42.558
he did have had the most
access to Mr. Graham's flask.

24:42.592 --> 24:45.460
And the woman, Mack,
sir, she was in Toronto.

24:45.495 --> 24:47.563
And jealousy is a powerful motive.

24:47.597 --> 24:50.899
Indeed, George. Let's hope Dr. Grace

24:50.933 --> 24:53.034
is having some luck identifying the poison.

24:53.069 --> 24:55.870
Once we discover what killed Mr. Graham,

24:55.905 --> 25:00.508
we'll be in a better position
to discover who killed him.

25:00.542 --> 25:04.278
Sir, I wonder if we could
continue this tomorrow.

25:04.313 --> 25:07.648
Oh, yes. Yes, of course, George.

25:07.683 --> 25:09.684
It'll be good to sleep
with a roof over one's head.

25:09.719 --> 25:11.586
I didn't catch a wink last night.

25:11.620 --> 25:13.554
The pillow didn't help?

25:34.609 --> 25:37.545
Hello there, Constable.

25:37.579 --> 25:41.181
You said, "perhaps another time."

25:41.215 --> 25:44.919
Well, that time has come.

25:44.953 --> 25:47.321
Oh my.

26:06.817 --> 26:09.018
George?

26:09.052 --> 26:10.987
one moment.

26:16.059 --> 26:18.060
Sir,

26:18.095 --> 26:20.496
thank God it's just you.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.465
Who were you expecting?

26:22.499 --> 26:25.134
Sir, that woman Mack has
been trying to seduce me.

26:25.168 --> 26:27.436
I found her there in my bed when I got back

26:27.471 --> 26:30.339
- to my room last night.
- Oh.

26:30.374 --> 26:33.842
Sir, I escorted her out
directly, make no doubt about it.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.045
She broke in here, George?

26:37.079 --> 26:39.515
Sir, it was quite unexpected.
I realize that women find me

26:39.549 --> 26:42.083
quite the catch, but that
is no way to win a man.

26:42.118 --> 26:44.219
George, is it possible that
she was after something else?

26:44.253 --> 26:46.154
Sir, I'm not making it
up. I found her right there

26:46.188 --> 26:48.156
in my bed. I've spent
the whole night in a chair

26:48.190 --> 26:50.158
against the door! I didn't catch a wink!

26:50.192 --> 26:52.828
George, she went to the
trouble of breaking the door.

26:52.862 --> 26:55.863
Is it possible that her
motives may have extended

26:55.898 --> 26:58.933
beyond the charms of one George Crabtree?

27:01.404 --> 27:04.406
Oh no! Oh no!

27:04.440 --> 27:06.408
Oh, sir...

27:06.442 --> 27:09.010
Graham's papers are gone.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.211
No.

27:12.915 --> 27:16.417
It appears our little friend's
breathing has improved.

27:16.451 --> 27:19.219
Well, that narrows our search.

27:19.254 --> 27:21.422
It would likely be among
one of the poisonous plants

27:21.456 --> 27:24.592
- that grow here in Ontario.
- What about wolfsbane?

27:24.626 --> 27:27.094
No. That would have caused asphyxia.

27:27.128 --> 27:29.896
White baneberry?

27:29.931 --> 27:31.898
The symptoms fit,

27:31.933 --> 27:33.900
but it's the fruit that's poisonous,

27:33.935 --> 27:36.303
and it's out of season.

27:36.337 --> 27:38.838
"Conium Heculatum."

27:40.475 --> 27:44.510
No. No, it's not hemlock.

27:44.545 --> 27:46.479
But Cicuta Maculata!

27:46.513 --> 27:48.982
Water hemlock.

27:49.016 --> 27:50.984
"Difficulty breathing. Convulsions."

27:51.018 --> 27:54.988
- That matches the symptoms.
- Emily, I daresay we've found our poison.

27:55.022 --> 27:57.090
- Thank you, Julia.
- My pleasure.

27:57.124 --> 28:00.025
I will telegraph the detective immediately.

28:00.060 --> 28:02.462
Ah, Doctor! There you are.

28:02.496 --> 28:05.264
- Is something the matter?
- Oh, on the contrary.

28:05.299 --> 28:07.733
My painting is about to
be judged later today.

28:07.767 --> 28:09.768
I was wondering if you would come with me.

28:09.803 --> 28:13.005
- I should be honoured.
- Ha.

28:15.909 --> 28:19.011
Where is the map?

28:19.045 --> 28:21.146
- What map?
- The map you stole

28:21.180 --> 28:22.681
from Constable Crabtree's room!

28:22.896 --> 28:25.397
What?!

28:25.431 --> 28:27.532
You were in Toronto when Graham died.

28:27.566 --> 28:29.968
You were alone in
Constable Crabtree's room.

28:30.003 --> 28:31.970
You are, at the moment, our prime suspect.

28:32.005 --> 28:35.307
George's door was open.

28:35.341 --> 28:38.610
I thought it was an invitation.

28:38.644 --> 28:40.945
Sir, I assure you, it was firmly locked.

28:40.979 --> 28:43.181
It was open, I swear.

28:43.215 --> 28:45.183
Whatever you may think,

28:45.217 --> 28:49.553
I don't normally have to
force myself into a man's bed.

28:49.587 --> 28:51.689
If you didn't open the room, then who did?

28:54.927 --> 28:57.862
I passed the greenhorn in the hallway

28:57.896 --> 28:59.530
on the way up to George's room.

28:59.564 --> 29:02.666
Jagger Brown?

29:02.701 --> 29:06.203
Mr. Brown, the Detective would
like to have a word with you.

29:06.237 --> 29:08.339
Certainly. Um...

29:12.577 --> 29:14.511
No! My money! Money! Money!

29:14.546 --> 29:17.581
- Come on!
- Gimme that!

29:17.615 --> 29:19.550
Gimme my money! Gimme my money!

29:19.584 --> 29:21.918
Ruffians! Get off, my friends! Gimme!

29:21.953 --> 29:23.486
Mine! I got it!

29:23.520 --> 29:26.323
- That money belongs to me!
- George.

29:26.357 --> 29:29.392
- Let go!
- Hey!

29:29.426 --> 29:31.427
That's my money!

29:35.967 --> 29:37.934
All right, all right, all right! All right!

29:37.969 --> 29:39.836
Where are the maps you stole?

29:39.870 --> 29:42.037
What maps?

29:42.072 --> 29:44.039
Empty your pockets, Mr. Brown.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.941
What?

29:49.946 --> 29:52.749
They're gone. Where could they have gone?

29:54.385 --> 29:57.386
No, wait, wait. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

30:05.262 --> 30:08.397
Roses in a vase. Seen that before.

30:08.431 --> 30:11.600
Yes. But there's no denying it
was painted by a capable hand.

30:11.634 --> 30:14.002
These are quite good, I suppose.

30:14.036 --> 30:16.004
I rather like this one.

30:16.038 --> 30:18.873
This one?! It's all just lines!

30:18.907 --> 30:22.443
Not even a tree in sight.

30:25.079 --> 30:28.949
- Where's my painting?
- Perhaps it's been moved.

30:28.983 --> 30:31.786
You there, what's happened to my work?

30:31.820 --> 30:34.788
Did no one from the gallery
inform you? It's been stolen,

30:34.822 --> 30:37.057
- I'm sorry to say.
- Stolen?!

30:37.091 --> 30:39.893
How the bloody hell did that happen?
How many other paintings were taken?

30:39.928 --> 30:42.729
- Only yours.
- I suppose it could be taken

30:42.763 --> 30:45.598
- as a compliment.
- I always said it was the best in the show.

30:46.133 --> 30:49.536
A thief with good taste
is a thief nonetheless.

30:49.570 --> 30:52.972
I'll get Worsley onto it.

30:53.006 --> 30:55.517
Do you suppose I'm still
eligible for the $10 prize?

30:55.883 --> 30:59.286
You have yet to provide
a satisfactory explanation

30:59.320 --> 31:01.688
for all of the money in
your briefcase, Mr. Gowdy.

31:01.722 --> 31:04.491
My affairs are none of your business.

31:04.525 --> 31:06.493
Perhaps as the new lead
surveyor, you required a healthy

31:06.527 --> 31:09.461
bribe from Mr. Richmond
to return the railway here.

31:09.496 --> 31:11.597
I did not require a bribe
to return the railway

31:11.631 --> 31:13.599
to its correct path.

31:13.633 --> 31:15.802
Mr. Richmond's contribution
was an added bonus.

31:15.836 --> 31:18.637
You were going to redirect
the railway here regardless?

31:18.672 --> 31:21.440
Of course. I don't know
why Graham was so intent

31:21.474 --> 31:23.475
on moving it. His plans made no sense.

31:23.510 --> 31:25.477
He even falsified our surveys to support

31:25.512 --> 31:28.180
- his proposed route.
- Did you confront him about this?

31:28.214 --> 31:30.382
I've only just discovered it
since going through his files.

31:30.417 --> 31:32.384
- I have no idea why he did it.
- Sir.

31:32.419 --> 31:34.820
Thank you, Mr. Gowdy.

31:34.854 --> 31:36.822
I would like to speak with
you further about this.

31:36.856 --> 31:40.025
At your service.

31:40.059 --> 31:43.228
Sir, Mr. Brown here
claims the maps are gone.

31:43.262 --> 31:45.597
He says they must have been
stolen in the kerfuffle just now.

31:45.631 --> 31:47.299
In any case, they're not on him.

31:47.333 --> 31:49.434
Not that I could make heads
nor tails of them anyway.

31:49.468 --> 31:51.502
- Good luck to whoever's got them.
- Thank you.

31:55.908 --> 31:58.476
Mr. Brown, you were acquainted

31:58.510 --> 32:01.212
- with Mr. Graham, were you not?
- Never met the man.

32:01.246 --> 32:02.742
- I beg to differ.
- Beg all you want.

32:02.743 --> 32:04.643
I didn't know him and you can't prove it.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.751
This telegram proves otherwise.

32:06.785 --> 32:09.019
You were seen with Mr. Graham in Toronto.

32:09.054 --> 32:11.389
- Seen?! Who saw me?
- You were seen!

32:11.423 --> 32:15.159
And Mr. Brown, you know
nothing about prospecting.

32:15.193 --> 32:17.161
What are you doing here?

32:17.195 --> 32:20.430
How did you know Mr.
Graham's maps were important?

32:22.834 --> 32:25.102
I was in the assayer's
office working the books

32:25.136 --> 32:27.338
- when he came in.
- Graham?

32:27.372 --> 32:29.906
Yes. He had a nugget. It must
have been the size of his fist.

32:29.940 --> 32:32.509
I only stole the map.
I didn't murder anyone.

32:32.643 --> 32:34.711
A nugget? Nugget of what?

32:34.746 --> 32:37.381
- Silver, Detective.
- Silver?

32:37.415 --> 32:39.349
He told the assayer there was
plenty more where that came from.

32:39.384 --> 32:41.385
I knew it had to be around here somewhere.

32:43.354 --> 32:46.055
Right, Mr. Brown, thank
you. You're free to go.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.827
Sir? I have to admit some confusion.

32:51.862 --> 32:54.063
Dr. Grace's telegram ascertains

32:54.098 --> 32:57.533
that Mr. Graham was indeed
poisoned by water hemlock.

32:57.567 --> 33:00.536
Sir, how does that prove that Jagger
Brown was seen with Graham in Toronto?

33:00.570 --> 33:03.873
It doesn't, George. The
telegram makes no mention

33:03.907 --> 33:05.875
- of Mr. Brown.
- But you just...

33:05.909 --> 33:07.877
Sir, you were bluffing!

33:07.911 --> 33:10.613
I was prospecting, George.

33:10.647 --> 33:13.716
At any rate, Dr. Grace's
findings prove that Mr. Brown

33:13.750 --> 33:15.718
- could not be the murderer.
- How so?

33:15.822 --> 33:19.624
- You don't want to be doing that.
- What? They're just parsnips.

33:19.658 --> 33:22.394
He was going to feed us all water hemlock.

33:22.428 --> 33:25.163
He didn't know it was poisonous.

33:25.198 --> 33:28.666
No. But everyone else here does.

33:36.349 --> 33:39.649
So, Mr. Graham rerouted the
railway to protect his silver find.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.318
Then why meet with a politician in Toronto?

33:42.352 --> 33:45.054
Surely, if he had falsified
surveys, that would be enough

33:45.088 --> 33:47.323
for the government to comply
with his recommendation.

33:47.357 --> 33:49.325
I think it has something to do

33:49.359 --> 33:51.528
with the Native reservation, George.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.595
A bribe, sir?

33:53.630 --> 33:56.198
Perhaps he bribed a member of
Parliament to seize Indian land?

33:56.233 --> 33:58.801
So he could lay claim to it himself?

33:58.835 --> 34:00.937
Which would mean that there is silver

34:00.971 --> 34:02.939
somewhere on the current reservation.

34:03.029 --> 34:06.131
Which means whoever has the maps knows
about the silver and where to find it.

34:06.165 --> 34:08.233
And they're one step ahead of us.

34:10.302 --> 34:14.438
Excuse me, may I see this?

34:14.473 --> 34:17.574
But... you haven't given
me my chalkboard back yet.

34:17.610 --> 34:20.678
Sir, I... we are police officers.

34:20.713 --> 34:22.746
We will bring back your chalkboard.

34:25.317 --> 34:28.784
The symbols, George. The crescent moon.

34:28.820 --> 34:31.121
Silver.

35:00.684 --> 35:02.318
There.

35:02.353 --> 35:05.121
The northernmost point of Long Lake.

35:06.790 --> 35:08.491
Thank you.

35:14.198 --> 35:17.099
Ah, Doctor.

35:17.133 --> 35:19.101
I was just thinking which
of my other paintings

35:19.135 --> 35:21.136
are good enough to be stolen. Ha! Ha!

35:21.171 --> 35:23.338
The gallery found this.

35:23.373 --> 35:25.340
My painting.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.543
It seems the thieves
discarded it in the alley.

35:27.578 --> 35:29.946
Oh, they stole it for the fancy frame.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.274
It appears so, but the
painting can be salvaged.

35:32.308 --> 35:34.276
I know someone who cleans canvases.

35:34.310 --> 35:36.278
- he might be able to help.
- Forget it.

35:36.312 --> 35:38.280
Bloody thieves were right.

35:38.314 --> 35:40.849
What's the point in salvaging
something that has no worth?

35:40.883 --> 35:42.784
- Inspector, I...
- Thank you, Doctor.

35:42.818 --> 35:46.388
Now, if you don't mind, I have quite
a bit of work to be getting on with.

35:54.296 --> 35:56.898
Sir, how do you know

35:56.932 --> 35:59.000
which way we should be headed?

35:59.035 --> 36:01.703
Well, George, the bottom
tip of the crescent moon

36:01.737 --> 36:05.140
was just north of the
top edge of Long Lake.

36:05.174 --> 36:07.908
Yes but, sir, how do we
know the silver is not

36:07.942 --> 36:11.179
right in the middle of
it? Or at the top of it?

36:11.213 --> 36:14.415
That's a good point, George. We'll
have to explore the entire area.

36:30.899 --> 36:33.333
Sir!

36:33.367 --> 36:36.403
Look at that.

36:36.437 --> 36:39.839
- Could that be silver?
- I believe it is, George.

36:44.144 --> 36:46.179
Look at this.

36:46.214 --> 36:49.816
It's a carved inscription.

36:49.850 --> 36:53.152
"Edward Graham, The 5th of August, 1902."

36:53.187 --> 36:55.922
Graham staked a claim here.

36:55.956 --> 36:58.390
There should be 4 more of these

36:58.425 --> 37:01.861
outlining the claim in its
entirety. But they would be

37:01.895 --> 37:04.663
on stumps still in the ground.

37:04.698 --> 37:07.700
Sir, stumps like this one, sir.

37:13.707 --> 37:15.674
But it's not his name.

37:15.709 --> 37:17.942
"M. McCarthy." Mack.

37:17.976 --> 37:20.177
"September 7, 1902."

37:24.149 --> 37:26.117
Edward Graham staked this claim,

37:26.151 --> 37:28.986
and then, Mack...

37:29.020 --> 37:31.055
put her name ahead of his.

37:31.089 --> 37:33.057
She was trying to jump his claim.

37:33.091 --> 37:36.861
Yes, George, I believe
Mack killed Edward Graham.

37:36.895 --> 37:39.029
Sir....

37:39.064 --> 37:41.232
I believe you're right.

37:41.266 --> 37:43.234
I'm sorry, gentlemen,

37:43.268 --> 37:45.169
but I have to protect my claim.

37:45.203 --> 37:48.505
Edward Graham's claim has no legitimacy,

37:48.539 --> 37:51.908
neither will yours. This is Indian land.

37:51.942 --> 37:53.910
Once the Government sees
that there's silver here,

37:53.944 --> 37:56.146
they'll see to it that
this land becomes fair game,

37:56.180 --> 37:58.482
and I will become a very rich woman.

37:58.516 --> 38:02.419
So of course, you understand
why I have to do this.

38:02.453 --> 38:04.755
- No!
- Sir!

38:06.557 --> 38:08.691
I don't suppose you
want to share my wealth?

38:08.725 --> 38:11.861
Oh, well. I'm so sorry

38:11.896 --> 38:13.696
but I have to shoot you too.

38:25.475 --> 38:27.677
- Sir, are you all right?
- George?

38:27.711 --> 38:29.779
Sir, are you alright?

38:29.813 --> 38:32.782
The medicine woman here took
the bullet out of your shoulder.

38:32.816 --> 38:34.917
You've been in delirium, in and out,

38:34.951 --> 38:37.520
but you're past the worst of it.

38:37.554 --> 38:41.123
They've been very good to us here sir.

38:41.157 --> 38:43.558
This man saved your life.

38:43.592 --> 38:46.195
Thank you.

38:46.229 --> 38:48.730
Thank you.

38:48.764 --> 38:52.301
_

38:53.202 --> 38:55.807
_

38:55.808 --> 38:59.961
_

38:59.962 --> 39:06.170
_

39:07.249 --> 39:09.283
Migizi Pimise.

39:11.286 --> 39:14.621
It's your name? In English,

39:14.656 --> 39:16.623
it means Eagle Flight,

39:16.658 --> 39:19.894
doesn't it?

39:19.928 --> 39:23.397
You know the properties of water hemlock.

39:23.631 --> 39:25.900
You poisoned

39:25.934 --> 39:29.603
Mr. Graham's flask when
you guided him to the train.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.041
Am I speaking the truth?

39:38.980 --> 39:40.947
Why?

39:40.982 --> 39:44.651
Silver. If people found
out, then we would...

39:44.686 --> 39:46.853
You would lose your home.

39:49.023 --> 39:52.092
Can you deny that you won't take it away?

39:52.126 --> 39:54.961
Can you deny we won't
be removed from our land?

39:54.996 --> 39:57.998
I... I... I can't. But that's not

39:58.032 --> 39:59.832
- what's at issue here.
- Go home.

39:59.867 --> 40:01.434
- No!
- Sir.

40:01.468 --> 40:03.669
Gentlemen, please don't, don't.

40:03.704 --> 40:06.305
Then, you will die here,

40:06.339 --> 40:08.340
your bodies never found, both of you.

40:08.375 --> 40:11.210
- Others will come for us.
- We will run.

40:11.244 --> 40:13.880
And they will chase you!

40:13.914 --> 40:15.882
Migizi Pimise, you...

40:15.916 --> 40:17.884
you are under arrest

40:17.918 --> 40:19.785
for the murder of Edward Graham.

40:19.819 --> 40:23.222
- Sir, they saved our lives!
- You have no authority here.

40:23.256 --> 40:25.224
This is not your world.

40:25.258 --> 40:27.226
We do not follow your laws.

40:27.260 --> 40:31.196
Yes, you do. Yes you do,
and you are coming with me.

40:31.231 --> 40:34.533
Will you add our 2
lives to your conscience?

40:36.502 --> 40:40.238
- I am protecting my birthright.
- And I am doing my duty.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.774
As I had to try and do mine.

40:45.110 --> 40:48.547
Go while you still have your lives.

41:01.693 --> 41:04.528
George...

41:04.563 --> 41:06.397
- I don't...
- Sir.

41:06.432 --> 41:10.000
- I don't...
- Sir!

41:18.601 --> 41:19.901
Inspector Brackenreid?

41:19.902 --> 41:21.062
Oh, hello.

41:21.605 --> 41:24.340
- What can I do for you?
- I'm sorry to disturb you,

41:24.375 --> 41:28.010
but I was hoping you might sell me
your painting from the exhibition.

41:28.044 --> 41:31.013
- Sell it to you?
- If you would.

41:31.047 --> 41:33.315
I'd like to try my hand at the canvas.

41:33.350 --> 41:37.286
Not to paint pale imitations
of the natural world,

41:37.320 --> 41:40.122
but rather to paint its essences as you do.

41:40.156 --> 41:43.258
I'd be prepared to pay.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.861
Oh... Oh well, I'm flattered,

41:45.895 --> 41:48.029
but it's not for sale.

41:48.063 --> 41:50.632
I'm thinking of reentering
it in the next exhibition.

41:50.666 --> 41:52.634
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:52.668 --> 41:55.169
Hold your horses, hold your horses.

41:55.204 --> 41:58.639
The prize money was $10. It's yours for 15.

41:58.673 --> 42:01.042
- 15?
- Take it or leave it.

42:03.012 --> 42:05.113
Alright.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.815
15. Wise choice. Mr...?

42:07.849 --> 42:10.484
- Thomson. Tom Thomson.
- Ah, well,

42:10.519 --> 42:13.388
Mr. Thomson, I hope I can
provide some inspiration.

42:13.422 --> 42:15.956
- Good day.
- Good day to you too.

42:18.593 --> 42:22.129
- Bloody fool!
- Inspector.

42:22.163 --> 42:24.197
Mrs. Brackenreid is on the telephone.

42:24.232 --> 42:27.167
Something about a missing picture frame.

42:27.201 --> 42:29.837
Oh... Oh, bloody hell.

42:29.871 --> 42:32.072
Thank you.

42:34.675 --> 42:37.911
Migizi Pimise turned himself in yesterday.

42:37.946 --> 42:41.315
I suppose he knew someone
would come looking for him.

42:41.349 --> 42:44.985
- And the people he was with?
- They moved further north.

42:45.019 --> 42:47.154
It won't go well for them, will it?

42:47.188 --> 42:49.188
The silver will draw prospectors

42:49.222 --> 42:51.658
like moths to a flame.

42:51.692 --> 42:53.660
Migizi Pimise started a fight

42:53.694 --> 42:56.028
he couldn't possibly hope to win.

42:56.063 --> 42:59.966
But surely, they have a
treaty that will protect them.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.168
Let's get you to bed.

43:02.202 --> 43:04.403
Our government is made

43:04.438 --> 43:06.939
of men of good conscience.

43:06.974 --> 43:10.276
Let's hope they honour it.
