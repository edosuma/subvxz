00:01.262 --> 00:03.090
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:04.178 --> 00:06.310
I imagine you have questions.

00:06.354 --> 00:07.485
I have answers.

00:07.529 --> 00:08.704
What is this place?

00:08.747 --> 00:10.488
A piece of your world,

00:10.532 --> 00:12.969
the dead planet Krypton.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.320
I love you so much.

00:16.364 --> 00:17.365
I saw her face.

00:17.408 --> 00:18.453
Mom?

00:18.496 --> 00:20.107
That was her.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.935
I will do everything
within my power
to keep you safe.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.328
The Rock
of Yuda Kal.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.243
Made of Kryptonian stone.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.506
Well, if the Rock of Yuda Kal
can be used
to make a Worldkiller,

00:28.550 --> 00:30.943
we could just reverse
the process
and use it to unmake one.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.945
We could turn Reign
back into Sam permanently.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.251
We can cure her.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.731
Now, it is very rare,

00:35.774 --> 00:37.776
but the exact same rock
is hurdling through space

00:37.820 --> 00:39.778
on a meteorite
about five light-years away.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.606
Then we better
get a move on.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.697
I always forget
how beautiful it is
this far out in space.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.177
It's perfect.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.526
Out here, with just you,

00:48.570 --> 00:52.226
I don't have to pretend.
I can just be me.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.100
We're coming up
on it.

00:58.580 --> 00:59.885
What is that?

01:08.938 --> 01:11.375
-It's a tractor beam.

01:11.419 --> 01:12.681
Everything's
locked up.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.074
Thrusters, roll...

01:14.117 --> 01:15.901
Yaw and pitch.
Nothing's responding.

01:18.121 --> 01:20.906
This ship can turn
into other things.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.865
Brainy's gonna be so sad
he missed this.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.840
Agent Schott,

01:42.580 --> 01:43.886
any word from Supergirl?

01:43.929 --> 01:45.322
No, but we expected that.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.976
They're on the dark side,

01:47.019 --> 01:48.456
which means they're
probably scraping off

01:48.499 --> 01:49.979
a nice chunk of space rock

01:50.022 --> 01:52.460
off a much larger piece
of space rock any minute.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.201
I need to know the second
they're on their way back.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.768
Well, I got the radio
dialed up to 11.

01:56.812 --> 01:59.771
Like, I re-tasked
six military satellites

01:59.815 --> 02:01.338
to scan all airspace
around the meteorite,

02:01.382 --> 02:03.819
and then I've just been
obsessively checking that scan

02:03.862 --> 02:05.777
for, like, the faintest blip.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.997
-I will not miss them.
-Hmm.

02:08.040 --> 02:12.828
And yet you seem, uh,
more stoic and grave
than usual,

02:12.871 --> 02:15.570
which, if we're being
honest, is making me,
like, a little bit queasy.

02:15.613 --> 02:18.181
What happened?
You tell me.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.835
Reign is becoming immune

02:19.878 --> 02:22.272
to Ms. Luthor's synthetic
Kryptonite faster than we
expected.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.274
Oh.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.494
To be on the safe side,
I've evacuated L-Corp,

02:26.537 --> 02:28.322
and I have a strike team
standing by

02:28.365 --> 02:31.020
with sound guns, body boots,
and red sun grenades.

02:31.063 --> 02:34.328
Because that's worked
approximately zero times
before.

02:34.371 --> 02:37.722
Do I seem appropriately
stoic and grave to you now,
Mr. Schott?

02:39.550 --> 02:41.291
Better crank that
baby up to 12.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.513
The cosmos.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.515
A tree of infinite branches

02:47.558 --> 02:49.038
flowering with stars.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.606
Now, Supergirl is up there
right now

02:51.649 --> 02:55.044
on a mission to find
a substance that's gonna
fix your mom.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.524
One of these stars
belongs to us.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.352
There's so much nothing.

02:58.395 --> 03:02.094
What if she doesn't
make it back in time?

03:02.138 --> 03:04.662
She's called "Supergirl"
for a reason.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.013
She will, I promise.

03:08.057 --> 03:10.146
We circle this star,
our sun...

03:10.190 --> 03:12.714
-...for life force.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.716
Why don't we
get out of here?

03:14.759 --> 03:18.241
I just happen to know
where there is a wicked
ice cream truck.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.939
And, I mean,
all the toppings.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.419
That's all I need right now.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.029
Let's do it. Me, too.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.990
I could definitely
be an astronaut.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.384
Mmm. I could see that.

03:30.427 --> 03:33.691
You know, once you get past
your motion-sickness thing,

03:33.735 --> 03:35.606
I think you'd be golden.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.565
That's funny.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.697
'Cause I never got motion
sickness until you started
driving me around.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.786
Ugh. Boo.

03:41.830 --> 03:44.006
All right, look,
let me see.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.095
Oh, yes,
that is amazing.

03:46.138 --> 03:49.751
I am getting you that hat.
You look adorable.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.492
That's really cute.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.363
Wait, let me see. All right.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.975
Excuse me.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.851
Okay, I'll tell you what.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.287
Why don't I pay
for all these things?

04:04.331 --> 04:07.029
Give me that. And then
you go get us some sodas.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.553
All right.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.947
Don't think I'm not gonna
count all that change.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.562
-Gun!

04:28.659 --> 04:30.182
Everybody, get back!

04:37.973 --> 04:39.931
Could you please
not blow up my lab?

04:43.457 --> 04:45.894
So, it's explosives
they're carrying.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.855
Your wall doesn't work
anymore.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.075
Neither does your Kryptonite.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.772
I'm getting stronger.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.123
Good morning, sunshine.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.473
You're very chatty today.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.649
How much longer do you think
you can hold me?

05:01.692 --> 05:02.911
Long enough.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.391
Long enough...

05:05.435 --> 05:07.045
For Supergirl to return.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.047
That's right.

05:10.919 --> 05:16.446
I see you,
Lena Kieran Luthor.

05:18.535 --> 05:23.279
I see your anger, your fear,
your distrust.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.327
Supergirl is your Hail Mary.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.547
You need her right now
and she needs you,

05:30.591 --> 05:32.157
but when this is all done,

05:33.768 --> 05:35.291
will you still
need each other?

05:37.946 --> 05:39.904
Supergirl and I
may not see eye-to-eye,

05:39.948 --> 05:42.559
but there's one thing
we can agree on.

05:42.603 --> 05:45.083
And that's that
you need to be stopped.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.957
So enjoy your moment
in the sun, Reign.

05:50.437 --> 05:54.136
'Cause we are gonna save Sam,
and end you.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.314
The only way to end me
is to kill me.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.578
And Sam.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.886
And I don't think
you have the stomach for that.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.727
There's an entire city here.
How did we miss this?

06:19.770 --> 06:20.945
We're on our own.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.513
And powerless.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.341
Well, we expected that.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.039
-That's the only thing
we've been right about.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.437
Looks like the Black Rock
is about a mile into the city.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.396
We better get moving
before they find us--

06:36.439 --> 06:37.527
Watch out!

06:45.448 --> 06:47.015
I think we lost them,

06:47.842 --> 06:49.060
whoever they are.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.237
We have other problems.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.674
They seem human.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.155
-At least we fit in.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.635
I'm not so sure about that.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.464
We need to change.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.639
Here.

07:08.036 --> 07:10.038
Okay.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.435
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.399
You okay?

07:23.443 --> 07:26.489
Yeah, just thinking
how ironic this is.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.057
Donning disguises
across the solar system

07:29.100 --> 07:30.841
seems to be my karma.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.843
It's necessary for survival.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.498
So is Kara Danvers.

07:35.542 --> 07:39.502
I just wish my day-to-day
life didn't have to have
a disguise.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.634
It's exhausting.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.244
In the future,
I just live in the open.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.680
All Legionnaires do.

07:43.724 --> 07:46.204
There's no secret identities,
no disguises.

07:46.248 --> 07:50.295
24/7, I'm just me,
Mon-El, from the Legion
of Super-Heroes.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.384
And it's still exhausting.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.213
What we do,
the responsibilities
we have...

07:55.257 --> 07:57.302
-There's always a trade-off,
isn't there?

07:57.346 --> 07:58.565
Hmm.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.742
We're getting close.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.091
It's this way.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.097
This place is intense.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.360
Yes. Definitely don't touch
anything.

08:11.403 --> 08:14.232
Agent Danvers,
Ruby, how are you?

08:14.276 --> 08:15.799
Oh, my gosh. It was crazy.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.627
There was this guy
at the park, and he was
shooting,

08:17.671 --> 08:19.411
and everyone was running,
and then Alex caught
a grenade.

08:19.455 --> 08:22.240
Uh, it was really just not
that big of a deal.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.504
I mean, we're fine,
so everything is chill.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.723
It's just super chill.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.551
Are you chill

08:28.595 --> 08:30.858
Listen, you know what, I have
some work that I have to do,

08:30.901 --> 08:34.905
so, um, how about you
just start reading that
Ada Lovelace book I got you?

08:34.949 --> 08:36.298
-Sure.
All right.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.605
Um, why don't you go
into the conference room?

08:39.301 --> 08:40.650
Get your read on.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.871
Someone's trying to kill me.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.614
Oh, things were not chill.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.180
You sure
you were the target?

08:49.224 --> 08:51.313
A hundred percent.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.967
Guys, this is really
bad. Okay?

08:53.010 --> 08:55.796
I can't have some psycho
who's trying to murder me

08:55.839 --> 08:58.407
out there on the loose
while I'm taking care of Ruby.

08:58.450 --> 09:02.629
I mean,
she's been through so much.
She's seen so much.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.761
And God forbid,
what if she got hurt?

09:04.805 --> 09:07.590
And it's on my watch.
I... I can't live with that.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.810
-All right, all right,
let's just...

09:09.853 --> 09:11.463
Who would want you dead?

09:11.507 --> 09:14.205
Where do we start?

09:14.249 --> 09:18.035
Okay, well, there's Griggs,
uh, the Hellgrammite,
Hannibal. I mean...

09:18.079 --> 09:21.125
Look, the Hellgrammite
and Griggs have been
in containment.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.649
So that's a no.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.476
Hannibal, we deported
after the Daxamite invasion.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.087
-Right.
-Okay, so let's just

09:26.130 --> 09:27.523
keep narrowing it down.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.786
Who else has tried to kill me
before and failed?

09:29.830 --> 09:33.094
What about
good ol' Ricky, huh?
He definitely hates you.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.356
Oh, hated.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.401
-Oh.

09:36.445 --> 09:39.143
But we shouldn't discount
people from your past,

09:39.187 --> 09:40.928
if this really is personal.

09:40.971 --> 09:44.018
It may be someone from before
your time at the DEO.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.890
Somebody who may have
threatened you before.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.196
Pull up Ron Collins.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.590
"Ronald Collins."
Let's see.

09:51.373 --> 09:52.983
Age 56.

09:53.027 --> 09:56.465
Recently made parole
after six failed attempts.
Wow.

09:56.508 --> 09:57.901
Uh, let's see.
He was in for...

09:57.945 --> 09:59.990
First-degree murder.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.427
I should know.
He was my first arrest.

10:02.471 --> 10:07.432
I'm sorry, that would have...
That would made you 17
when you arrested him.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.870
Yeah, that... That tracks.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.046
He lived his whole life
in Midvale,

10:12.089 --> 10:14.483
and then he moves to
National City after he was
released from prison?

10:14.526 --> 10:16.137
Eh, it's a big city.

10:16.180 --> 10:20.402
And yet, he moved to within
six blocks of your apartment.

10:20.445 --> 10:23.448
Okay, I ruined his life.
He's trying to ruin mine.

10:23.492 --> 10:24.798
That's him.

10:24.841 --> 10:25.973
Um...

10:27.322 --> 10:29.629
-Winn, about Ruby.
Hmm?

10:30.542 --> 10:32.632
No! No, I can't.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.460
No, I do not babysit anymore.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.594
She's 12, okay?
She's not a baby.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.205
So, it's just...
You know, your words.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.251
Chill, it'll be fine.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.905
It takes a village,
Agent Schott.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.474
The Black Rock
is definitely in there.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.478
Let's go.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.750
Kara.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.013
"And on Earth,
the soul is lost

11:06.056 --> 11:07.667
"in destruction.

11:08.842 --> 11:12.106
"May their flames forever burn
in Rao's light."

11:12.149 --> 11:13.847
It's a Kryptonian memorial.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.024
-This is Krypton.
-No.

11:18.808 --> 11:19.853
Argo.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.337
Don't move.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.557
Identify yourself.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.081
Stay where you are.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.300
Do not move.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.910
Stand down,
caretakers.

11:40.830 --> 11:41.962
Mom.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.093
Kara?

11:45.095 --> 11:46.401
Is that you?

11:59.196 --> 12:00.545
Wow.

12:00.589 --> 12:01.851
How are you alive?

12:01.895 --> 12:03.940
Your father created a shield
to protect Argo

12:03.984 --> 12:05.986
when Krypton exploded.

12:06.029 --> 12:09.206
We would never have
sent you away if we had
known it'd work.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.731
I thought you were dead.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.256
I don't understand.
I saw your pod

12:15.299 --> 12:16.561
get knocked into
the Phantom Zone.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.999
I... I was stuck
there for years,

12:19.042 --> 12:22.350
but somehow,
my pod got loose,

12:22.393 --> 12:24.091
and I fell to Earth
with Kal-El.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.832
Kal made it.
He's... He's alive.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.007
He got there first.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.486
If I had known...

12:28.530 --> 12:31.576
If I knew Argo was here,
if I knew you were alive,

12:31.620 --> 12:33.753
I never would have stopped
searching for you.

12:39.628 --> 12:40.760
I recognize you.

12:42.457 --> 12:43.675
The Prince of Daxam.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.417
There is no more Daxam.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.246
I'm just Mon-El now, ma'am.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.945
There's no more Krypton,
either. Only Argo.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.424
And you are welcome here.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.644
Thank you.

12:58.865 --> 13:02.129
If you didn't know I was
alive, and you weren't
searching for me,

13:02.956 --> 13:04.261
what brought you here?

13:04.305 --> 13:07.656
Earth. Earth is in trouble.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.702
When Krypton exploded,
the followers of Yuda Kal

13:10.746 --> 13:14.010
sent three pods after me,
each with a Worldkiller.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.272
A Worldkiller?

13:15.316 --> 13:17.884
I stopped two of them,
but one remains.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.059
Reign.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.626
And she's terrorizing Earth.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.760
She's hurting people I love,
murdering indiscriminately.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.762
And we think we found
something that could stop her,

13:26.806 --> 13:30.287
and we followed
its radiation signature here.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.725
Harun-El.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.467
The Black Rock of Yuda Kal.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.773
You know what it is?

13:39.601 --> 13:42.647
After the fallout,
ashes and destruction
poisoned the air.

13:42.691 --> 13:45.825
We had nothing to protect us
as we hurtled through space.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.828
The young and the old
were the first to become
sick.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.613
They struggled
in our new atmosphere,

13:51.656 --> 13:53.528
their lungs more vulnerable,
more weak.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.399
But after the fallout passed,

13:55.443 --> 13:58.446
the shield kept our atmosphere
more hospitable.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.406
It is what your father
gave his life for.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.060
There was no more time.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.889
Argo was in constant darkness.
We were running out of air.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.326
We were dying.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.807
Your father repurposed
his unfinished research

14:11.851 --> 14:13.983
to create a livable
environment.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.681
He believed that the Harun-El
could act as a shield for
the city,

14:16.725 --> 14:18.466
and he was right.

14:18.509 --> 14:22.905
His legacy keeps our air
breathable, and shields us
from invaders.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.254
It keeps us hidden--

14:24.298 --> 14:26.996
That's why we didn't
detect you in our scans.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.824
Why there were
no signs of life.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.870
And why we can't
get in touch with Earth.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.872
-No signal can get out.
-Exactly.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.135
We mined all
the Harun-El left.
All of it is here.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.877
And every ounce of it
means one more moment of life.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.403
Because of that,
we have none to spare.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.275
There's gotta be a way.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.060
We only need a little bit.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.539
It is not mine to give.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.804
But I will call a meeting
with the High Council.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.024
Thank you.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.766
It'll take a few hours
to gather the members.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.421
In the meantime,

15:01.857 --> 15:06.427
I was hoping to
get to know my daughter.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.826
Have you heard anything
from Supergirl yet?

15:16.263 --> 15:18.787
No. That's why
I'm still sitting here.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.921
Can you show me
how this all works?

15:21.964 --> 15:25.576
You know what,
no offense, kid,
I really... I don't need help.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.580
Then I can just
keep you company.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.452
You know, I'm really busy.
Um...

15:33.280 --> 15:36.805
-Yeah, you seem
stressed out.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.938
Do I Oh, well,
you know, I have been staring

15:38.981 --> 15:40.940
at a stupid computer monitor
for about 36 hours.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.377
I haven't slept.
Haven't eaten anything.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.813
Haven't even
had time to go get

15:44.856 --> 15:46.771
my damn pizza bagel
out of the microwave.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.296
All I've done is monitor
about 10 million miles
of outer space

15:49.339 --> 15:51.254
waiting for confirmation
that Supergirl...

15:51.298 --> 15:54.301
Supergirl is on her way back
to Earth with the Black Rock
of Yuda Kal,

15:54.344 --> 15:56.738
-so we can finally stop and
defeat--
-My mom.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.526
Well, um...

16:04.485 --> 16:07.401
Reign is technically
not your mom.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.750
You're right.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.492
Reign is a monster,

16:11.535 --> 16:13.668
and my mom has disappeared.

16:15.322 --> 16:19.282
I might never get her back
again, or even see her.

16:19.326 --> 16:22.372
Especially if Supergirl
doesn't come back soon.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.635
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

16:24.679 --> 16:27.377
-Um...
-I don't sleep
anymore, either.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.901
I'm exhausted, too.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.926
-Where are you going,
Sheriff?
-Far away from you.

16:54.970 --> 16:58.582
That's right. That's because
you prefer to shoot from
a distance.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.716
Or behind the back,
like a coward.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.587
Kenny Lee was a long time ago.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.415
I'm not talking about
Kenny Lee.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.766
Two of whatever he's having.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.119
I'm not surprised.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.816
You sent me to jail
when you were...

17:14.859 --> 17:17.079
-Seventeen.
-Seventeen.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.602
You're trying to kill me.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.085
Are you kidding?

17:23.129 --> 17:25.740
You tried to shoot me
this morning at the park.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.221
At the park?

17:28.264 --> 17:30.310
Heh, man.

17:30.353 --> 17:31.702
Are you still 17?

17:31.746 --> 17:33.748
You don't even care
about the countless kids

17:33.791 --> 17:35.924
that you could've hurt
trying to get to me.

17:35.967 --> 17:39.536
Then again, what's one more
dead kid to you, right?

17:39.580 --> 17:41.408
I owed a debt for what I did.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.844
I paid my debt.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.933
What you did was murder
a teenage boy.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.109
And I have to live
with that! Forever.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.329
Oh, you want me to feel
sorry for you?

17:49.372 --> 17:50.634
Why would you?

17:51.679 --> 17:53.115
I don't even feel
sorry for me.

17:54.899 --> 17:58.120
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that young boy's face.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.993
The future that I stole
from him.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.778
I see the blood
bursting out of his body.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.128
I can feel the weight
of the gun in my hands.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.090
I wasn't a good person.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.656
I was corrupt.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.224
Then I never thought of myself
as a killer.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.098
Kid killer.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.058
But it turns out,
I was a monster.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.148
And I deserved
everything I got.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.761
But I'm not trying
to kill you, Danvers.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.067
What the hell difference
would that make?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.156
It's not gonna bring
Kenny back.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.158
It's not gonna save me.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.681
I'm already damned.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.648
J'onn, it's not Collins.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.962
Seriously?

19:17.243 --> 19:18.896
I was so sure it was
the Sheriff.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.333
We'll figure this out.

19:20.376 --> 19:21.725
The list of people
that want me dead is endless.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.292
All the more reason
to cull it.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.512
No, J'onn, look,
you don't understand.

19:25.555 --> 19:28.123
If Sam is gone,
I am all that Ruby has left.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.690
And if I'm gone...

19:30.299 --> 19:31.735
Screw the list.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.955
If this guy wants me,
he can come and get me.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.130
It's our turn to hunt.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.479
You wanna set a trap.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.786
Like I said,
I'm already a target, right?

19:38.829 --> 19:40.918
So let's draw this guy out
and take him down.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.417
I remember this flower.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.854
This is a Dar-Essa.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.771
You kept one in my room
when I was little.

20:07.815 --> 20:11.122
It was a gift from Grandmother
for your first birthday.

20:11.166 --> 20:15.779
Yeah, you used to measure it
to see how tall it was.

20:15.823 --> 20:18.042
It was, um...
Wasn't it supposed to...

20:18.086 --> 20:19.305
Grow as you grew?

20:20.480 --> 20:22.264
Yes, I got it for you
when you were so little,

20:22.308 --> 20:24.571
but you outsped the Dar-Essa.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.790
You grew so tall so fast.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.836
I can't believe
it survived the fall.

20:29.924 --> 20:32.231
It's strong, like you.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.017
I feel as though
I've let you down.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.453
-Mom--
-No, please.

20:37.497 --> 20:41.457
I... I shouldn't have
accepted that you died.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.416
I had always
taught you to hope.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.461
But I gave up.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.681
I could say the same.

20:47.724 --> 20:51.119
I gave up hope. I thought you
had died with Krypton.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.991
But here I am,
and here you are.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.993
So tell me about your life.
I've missed so much.

20:56.907 --> 20:57.908
Uh...

20:59.345 --> 21:00.781
Okay. Uh...

21:01.999 --> 21:04.480
I was taken in
by this amazing family.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.830
Jeremiah, Eliza,

21:06.874 --> 21:08.136
um, a sister, Alex.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.311
A sister?

21:09.355 --> 21:10.747
And she's so much
more than that.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.881
She's a friend. She's...
She's amazing.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.187
Um...

21:16.231 --> 21:17.754
Fort Rozz crashed on Earth.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.540
Fort Rozz was
my deepest shame.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.021
The prisoners,
they all survived?

21:24.587 --> 21:25.980
Astra survived.

21:26.850 --> 21:27.895
Non, too.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.202
I've thought of her so much.

21:31.246 --> 21:34.162
I should've listened to her,
but the way she did things
was so...

21:34.205 --> 21:35.206
Wrong.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.904
Yeah.

21:36.947 --> 21:40.211
Her and Non tried to bring
terror to Earth for a while,

21:40.255 --> 21:42.910
but she changed.

21:44.259 --> 21:45.347
Well,

21:45.391 --> 21:46.827
she was changing.

21:47.828 --> 21:48.959
Before she died.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.050
We gave her Kryptonian
burial rites.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.925
On Argo, we learn
from Krypton's mistakes.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.623
We look to our past
for edification.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.887
My mistakes were
the biggest of all.

22:05.193 --> 22:06.934
I sent so many

22:06.977 --> 22:10.241
to suffer at that prison
without a second thought.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.506
You just... You did
what you thought was right.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.985
So did Astra.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.640
But I was wrong.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.296
It took losing you,

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
losing everything,
to learn that.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.129
Can you forgive me?

22:28.172 --> 22:30.523
Of course I do.
Of course.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.155
Excuse me.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.983
My friend and I
were in trouble earlier,

22:56.026 --> 22:59.595
and we needed to borrow these
so we could, uh, fit in.

22:59.639 --> 23:02.337
You mean you needed
a disguise.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.470
The daughter of the great
House of El back from
the dead.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.168
That's all anyone
could talk about today.

23:07.211 --> 23:10.171
I'm afraid I don't have
any money to pay you
for these.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.129
Oh, keep them. It's a gift.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.567
It's my honor.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.787
Well, perhaps I can
give you a gift in return.

23:17.831 --> 23:20.311
Uh, your son,
he has Thalonite lung?

23:20.355 --> 23:21.574
Yes.

23:22.357 --> 23:23.532
Val?

23:25.404 --> 23:28.363
Krypton eradicated the disease
when I was still a child,

23:28.407 --> 23:29.930
but much was lost.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.453
This is Val.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.456
Hey, Val. I'm Mon-El.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.546
You may not believe this,
but I'm actually...
I'm from the future.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.636
So is this.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.769
This is called a...

23:44.205 --> 23:46.033
You know what,
it doesn't matter
what it's called.

23:46.076 --> 23:49.166
What matters is that a really,
really smart friend of mine,

23:49.210 --> 23:50.603
he made it.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.518
His name is Brainy,
so it's gotta work, right?

23:52.561 --> 23:54.128
Can I see your arm
for a second?

23:54.171 --> 23:55.564
Yeah.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.482
-It's a built-in size.
It's a vaccine and booster.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.920
It'll automatically detect
hostile cells and deploy
antibodies.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.270
He should wear it for a week.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.578
And then,

24:09.622 --> 24:12.973
maybe you can find someone
else who needs it, and give it
to them.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.588
It's a miracle.

24:29.772 --> 24:30.991
Slept here again, huh?

24:31.034 --> 24:32.558
I don't really
have much choice.

24:32.601 --> 24:33.950
Mmm.

24:37.737 --> 24:40.217
Reign's becoming immune
to my Kryptonite.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.481
If Supergirl
doesn't get back soon,

24:42.524 --> 24:44.918
she'll become stronger
and break out, and then
God knows what will happen.

24:46.659 --> 24:50.750
But I can still flood her
system with the Kryptonite.
It would work.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.142
She would OD, but...

24:54.144 --> 24:55.450
She would die.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.191
So you lose Sam.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.584
It's Sam or the world.

25:02.370 --> 25:05.242
I mean, well, there's still
a chance that Supergirl
can come back in time.

25:05.286 --> 25:06.330
And if she doesn't?

25:11.814 --> 25:13.337
James, I don't know
what to do.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.865
What would Sam
want you to do?

25:18.908 --> 25:20.214
Sam wanted me to heal her.

25:20.257 --> 25:23.870
No. Not what Sam
wanted you to do.

25:23.913 --> 25:26.220
What would Sam
want you to do now

25:26.263 --> 25:28.352
with the choice
that you're presented with?

25:32.226 --> 25:33.357
She'd choose Ruby

25:34.663 --> 25:35.882
over anything.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.362
Even her own life.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.497
She'd want me
to protect her daughter.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.759
It's a difficult choice,

25:45.369 --> 25:47.241
but it sounds like
you have the answer.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.297
I'm a... I'm a jerk.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.213
Yeah.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.873
I know what
you're going through.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.094
I actually... I actually do.

26:14.137 --> 26:18.707
I had a very complicated
relationship with my dad.

26:22.276 --> 26:26.933
He actually tried to,
um, kill me, too,
believe it or not.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.327
And, you know,
for the longest time,

26:31.677 --> 26:34.114
dude, I was terrified

26:34.157 --> 26:37.639
that whatever made him
what he was,

26:37.683 --> 26:39.423
like, that that was
inside of me, too.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.776
You know, that evil.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.039
I know what you mean.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.477
But you're not evil.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.350
No. No, I'm not.

26:53.394 --> 26:54.743
Just a jerk.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.093
Hey, Supergirl's
coming back.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.879
And I... I kinda
need some help.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.446
Maybe you could

27:04.492 --> 27:07.147
aid me in tracking Supergirl?

27:09.323 --> 27:12.587
Oh, come on.
I'll teach you
how to be a jerk.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.328
Is everyone in position?

27:20.508 --> 27:22.989
I repeat. Is everyone
in position?

27:23.990 --> 27:25.382
We're good to go, J'onn.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.123
Copy that.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.864
Keep your eyes open,
everybody.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.351
Where have you been?

27:38.526 --> 27:39.527
Sightseeing.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.183
You didn't need that
disguise after all.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.708
You get to just be you here.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.841
-Supergirl.
-Not Supergirl.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.104
Kara Zor-El.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.150
Are you ready?

27:54.629 --> 27:55.891
Yes.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.559
Allow me to introduce
my daughter.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.561
Kara.

28:14.562 --> 28:15.911
Welcome home.

28:19.001 --> 28:23.745
Esteemed members of
the High Council of Argo City.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.313
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.010
Alura is a pillar
of our community,

28:28.054 --> 28:30.839
and a long-standing member
of this council.

28:30.883 --> 28:34.016
We would be remiss in refusing
her daughter an audience.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.715
As you may know,

28:36.758 --> 28:39.108
Zor-El and I came up
with a plan to save Kara

28:39.152 --> 28:42.764
during the dark days
before Krypton's destruction.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.419
We didn't know
that Argo could survive,

28:45.462 --> 28:48.509
and so we put Kara,
our only child,

28:48.552 --> 28:50.903
into a pod and we sent her
to Earth.

28:50.946 --> 28:53.644
Its people took her in.
They saved her.

28:55.081 --> 28:56.430
And in exchange,

28:56.473 --> 28:59.041
she serves the people
of her adopted home.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.914
She's a hero

29:01.957 --> 29:05.352
that embodies
our greatest ideals.

29:05.395 --> 29:06.788
But unfortunately,
Kara was not

29:06.832 --> 29:09.660
the only Kryptonian
to travel to Earth.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.707
A Worldkiller followed.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.623
You must forgive
our skepticism.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.017
You've been away a long time.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.540
Here on Argo,

29:19.583 --> 29:21.629
Worldkillers are the stuff
of children's stories.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.413
I, too, was hesitant

29:23.457 --> 29:25.285
to believe that such a thing
could be real,

29:25.328 --> 29:27.722
but I faced it.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.680
She is real.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.118
And she calls herself Reign.

29:33.684 --> 29:36.731
I traveled here
from across the stars

29:36.775 --> 29:38.864
because I could not
defeat her myself.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.649
And Earth is in grave danger.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.520
An unfortunate situation
if true,

29:43.564 --> 29:46.349
but how can Argo be of help?

29:46.393 --> 29:47.655
Indeed.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.613
We are a recovering city.

29:49.657 --> 29:53.269
Still limping wounded
from the trauma
of destruction.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.968
We can't communicate
outside our protective dome,

29:56.011 --> 29:58.579
let alone send troops or aid
beyond its border.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.320
It isn't troops we need.

30:00.363 --> 30:01.800
Then what is it you seek?

30:04.237 --> 30:05.499
A gift...

30:06.543 --> 30:07.849
Of Harun-El.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.856
Any sign of the suspect?

30:14.900 --> 30:16.423
All's quiet down here.

30:16.466 --> 30:20.340
But I'm completely exposed,
so if he's gonna strike,

30:20.383 --> 30:21.732
the time is now.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.345
Come on. Where are you?

30:25.388 --> 30:29.566
You would have us give away
our most precious resource,

30:29.610 --> 30:32.874
our only lifeline,
to an alien species?

30:32.918 --> 30:35.224
The people of Earth
share our ideals.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.314
They're more like us
than you realize.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.839
Or perhaps you've become
more like them than
you realize.

30:40.882 --> 30:43.015
With all due respect,
Councilman,

30:43.058 --> 30:46.888
the danger currently facing
Earth is of Kryptonian making.

30:46.932 --> 30:50.631
And I need not remind you,
Alura, that Krypton is dead.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.241
Argo City is all that remains.

30:52.285 --> 30:56.942
And yet the sins of Krypton
live on in this Worldkiller.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.031
Can you abide this
as our legacy?

30:59.074 --> 31:02.512
This council does not
concern itself with legacy,
only survival.

31:02.556 --> 31:06.081
And what is the point
of survival if there's
no soul to save?

31:06.125 --> 31:07.953
I agree with Jul-Us.

31:07.996 --> 31:10.129
His position is wise
and thoughtful.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.919
Status check.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.747
No sign of your suspect.

31:22.228 --> 31:23.577
Wait a minute.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.405
I think I got something.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.929
Northwest. Baseball hat.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.804
J'onn, we're made.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.763
I think he knows
that you're not me.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.591
How did he know which one
of us is which?

31:37.634 --> 31:40.942
I don't know,
but he's on the move.
I'm going after him.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.815
Wait for backup,
Agent Danvers.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.647
Damn it, Alex.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.348
Your point is well-made

31:55.391 --> 31:57.219
that Krypton is dead.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.135
But its legacy lives on.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.703
For good and ill.

32:04.139 --> 32:07.099
My own mother sentenced
prisoners to Fort Rozz.

32:07.142 --> 32:10.493
Prisoners who broke free
and took their anger out
on Earth,

32:10.537 --> 32:12.974
many of whom
we're still trying
to apprehend.

32:15.324 --> 32:20.155
There are people
on Earth who work every day

32:20.199 --> 32:22.984
to solve the mistakes
of Krypton's past.

32:23.028 --> 32:26.422
People who are trying
to make Earth fairer.

32:26.466 --> 32:29.817
Or just better.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.906
These people dedicate
their lives to this work,

32:31.950 --> 32:34.822
and some have even
given their lives to it.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.824
This planet, these...

32:36.867 --> 32:41.568
These people, they took me in.

32:41.611 --> 32:45.006
An alien immigrant
from a world they
knew nothing about.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.488
A world whose legacy
threatened their way of life,

32:48.531 --> 32:51.621
and their safety, again
and again, and again.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.582
And now,
they deserve it in kind

32:55.625 --> 32:57.758
because their very existence

32:57.801 --> 33:02.806
is threatened by this
Worldkiller of Kryptonian
making.

33:02.850 --> 33:07.028
My mother tells me
Argo City has changed,

33:07.072 --> 33:11.163
that it has learned
from the mistakes
of Krypton's past.

33:12.599 --> 33:13.992
So, I beg you.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.386
Give us the gift of Harun-El.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.432
We don't need very much.

33:19.475 --> 33:21.303
And this bit of charity,

33:23.305 --> 33:24.437
it will save Earth.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.354
Well said, Kara Zor-El.

33:28.397 --> 33:31.966
But my concern is for
those of us you left behind.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.231
I'm afraid we cannot spare
the Harun-El.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.933
Hello, Agent Danvers.

33:42.977 --> 33:45.414
That was a neat trick
with your Martian pet.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.116
-I recognize you.
-Not me.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.595
My twin brother.

33:52.639 --> 33:55.468
And you should.
After all, you arrested him.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.644
He was on Fort Rozz.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.994
-He killed 12 people.
-Lies!

34:14.704 --> 34:16.010
Who votes with me?

34:21.842 --> 34:24.453
And those who believe
we should help the people
of Earth

34:24.497 --> 34:25.846
in their time of need?

34:31.765 --> 34:33.506
And how do you vote, Selena?

34:35.073 --> 34:37.901
If this Reign is as strong
as you say she is,

34:37.945 --> 34:40.121
are you sure this plan
will work?

34:40.165 --> 34:41.296
I am.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.170
We will give you
what you seek.

34:48.651 --> 34:49.870
Thank you.

34:56.137 --> 34:59.749
Argo was spared the fate
of the rest of Krypton.

34:59.793 --> 35:04.232
But what value is our
civilization if we don't use
our stolen time

35:04.276 --> 35:07.453
to right the sins
of the past?

35:07.496 --> 35:10.760
We must set an example
for future generations.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.764
Or else our survival
means nothing.

35:18.203 --> 35:19.943
Thank you.

35:19.987 --> 35:22.163
May Rao's light
shine upon you.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.173
It was a pleasure meeting you.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.262
I'm very fond
of your daughter.

35:34.306 --> 35:37.222
As are many others on Earth,
and across time.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.528
You should be very proud
of what she's become.

35:39.572 --> 35:40.921
I am.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.841
It's amazing that something
so small and unremarkable

35:47.884 --> 35:49.973
could hold the key
to so much survival.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.368
For you.

35:56.589 --> 35:59.983
The last time I left you,
I thought I'd never
see you again.

36:01.594 --> 36:02.943
I know better now.

36:06.425 --> 36:08.427
Now go save your friend.

36:09.776 --> 36:11.430
Earth is waiting for its hero.

36:52.427 --> 36:56.126
Hey, we just finished
interrogating your attacker.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.998
He's from Naja Falk 7.

36:58.041 --> 37:01.393
He was able to tell us apart
with his heightened sense of
smell.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.525
A whole list of suspects
from my past,

37:03.569 --> 37:05.223
and he wasn't even on it.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.050
Yeah.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.488
You know, when you first
approached me about working
at the DEO,

37:09.531 --> 37:11.359
I was failing med school,

37:11.403 --> 37:15.276
I was drunk,
and I was completely lost.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.063
But you, J'onn,
you gave me purpose.

37:20.107 --> 37:25.068
You know, something
to stand up for, something
to devote my life to.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.028
But today,

37:28.071 --> 37:30.683
I risked my life for it.

37:30.726 --> 37:33.512
You know, I jumped straight
across without hesitating,

37:33.555 --> 37:35.470
without even thinking.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.516
And to be honest,

37:37.559 --> 37:39.213
I mean, that wasn't even
the tallest building

37:39.257 --> 37:40.736
that I have jumped off of

37:40.780 --> 37:42.390
in the line of duty.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.610
You are someone
who makes the hard choices,
Alex.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.656
You go the extra mile.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.050
Yeah, exactly.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.226
And that's who I am.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.055
It's just baked into me.

37:55.098 --> 37:58.014
You know, jumping buildings,
making enemies.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.060
That's all part of the job.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.714
Mmm-hmm.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.107
But the irony here is...

38:04.151 --> 38:09.199
Is that the thing that I had
to do to save myself

38:09.243 --> 38:13.552
is the very same thing
that could have killed me.

38:13.595 --> 38:17.382
I mean, one more inch,
and I would have died.

38:19.471 --> 38:20.602
And then...

38:22.300 --> 38:23.605
Where would she be?

38:32.397 --> 38:36.705
I broke up with Maggie
because I wanted to be
a mother.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.142
And one day, I will be.

38:39.186 --> 38:43.712
You know, whether I'm with
somebody or if I'm doing it
by myself.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.412
I know that's what I want.

38:47.455 --> 38:50.763
And I know that that
is who I am.

38:50.806 --> 38:54.723
Just like I know that I'm
the person that's gonna
jump the building

38:54.767 --> 38:56.072
to stop the bad guy.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.425
And I...
I keep wondering.

39:00.468 --> 39:05.125
I mean, can those
two people coexist?

39:06.953 --> 39:08.563
And is that fair?

39:10.260 --> 39:13.176
Is it fair to the person
that I'm coming home to?

39:13.220 --> 39:14.787
Hey, come on.

39:16.005 --> 39:17.355
Look, you may be the person

39:17.398 --> 39:19.444
who jumps the building
to stop the bad guy,

39:19.487 --> 39:21.707
but you're also one
of the most intelligent,

39:21.750 --> 39:24.362
and intuitive women I know.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.452
You're an incredible agent.

39:27.495 --> 39:31.107
And I know you're going to be
an incredible mother.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.981
So when the time is right,

39:35.024 --> 39:37.549
I know you'll make the choice
that's right for you.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.465
Thank you.

39:48.255 --> 39:51.780
In the darkness
of Rao's absence,

39:51.824 --> 39:56.219
I call upon you,
the bringer of justice,

39:56.263 --> 39:59.179
the harbinger of death.

39:59.222 --> 40:03.401
I call upon you, Worldkiller.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.884
There's no one to pray to.

40:08.928 --> 40:12.366
There is no god,
there is no Rao.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.631
There is nothing
except you and me,

40:16.675 --> 40:20.418
and that kill switch you think
I haven't noticed.

40:20.461 --> 40:23.682
The one that will end me
before I end you.

40:26.293 --> 40:29.775
You're strong, ruthless.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.606
You are so much darker
than you realize.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.566
You're just like me.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.700
You wish.

40:43.092 --> 40:44.572
I don't have to wish.

40:44.616 --> 40:47.227
I'm standing right here.
I can see it with my own eyes.

40:48.968 --> 40:53.494
The same eyes that
will set fire to you
and your world

40:53.538 --> 40:56.149
if you don't press that button
and end me.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.260
Lena, we're here.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.479
Did you get the rock?

41:23.393 --> 41:24.656
Just in time.
