A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.846 --> 00:16.975
[Ollanta on TV]  The neighbors, we've been
denouncing the sweatshop for a long time.

00:17.058 --> 00:21.646
For months, and no one did anything.
There were no inspections, nothing.

00:21.730 --> 00:25.483
How much more of this can we take?
Tolerating deaths, eh?

00:25.900 --> 00:28.028
This fucker is Ollanta,
he plays the neighbor

00:28.111 --> 00:32.032
and runs a sweatshop network close by.
He should've been in jail years ago

00:32.115 --> 00:36.077
for human trafficking, but no,
three cars, vacations at Punta Cana...

00:36.161 --> 00:39.456
...how does he pay for it?
Prostituting people, exploiting them.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.582
Sit down.

00:40.665 --> 00:45.086
There's a network of complicity here.
The city government has to step up,

00:45.170 --> 00:48.298
because they authorize the sweatshops,
then they raid them

00:48.381 --> 00:52.218
and they imprison these people
who are working like slaves, you see?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.512
My brother worked in the sweatshop.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.724
-Have you shown these to anyone else?
-No.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.935
Don't fuck with the fashion world.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.062
Hmm?

01:02.145 --> 01:06.316
Don't even think about showing these
to the cops. They're all paid off. Look.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.486
I have a collection of these.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.698
To be taken as evidence,
they have to be found in the sweatshop,

01:13.782 --> 01:17.035
but Forensics have already been in,
and they found nothing.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.413
They take care
not to add the labels there.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.333
Your brother knew very well
who he was sewing for.

01:23.666 --> 01:24.918
What if they did another?

01:26.503 --> 01:27.545
Another inspection?

01:28.671 --> 01:31.090
I just told you.
They'd have to find them there.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.010
I don't think they'll do another.
We have to wait.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.806
-Wait for what?
-For the case to advance, Teo.

01:37.889 --> 01:38.932
No fucking way!

01:39.432 --> 01:42.310
That fucker said my brother
caught fire for being drunk.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.438
He didn't survive because he was wasted.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.649
They do whatever they want.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.401
They decide who lives, who dies,
and who's to blame.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.154
A mafia that has to be taken apart...

01:54.030 --> 01:56.032
...and we have to get in there to do it.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.749
I'll get in.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.345
[he exhales deeply]

02:19.013 --> 02:23.101
A sweatshop, I can't believe it!
I know everyone we work with.

02:23.184 --> 02:27.355
You hire a service,
that's the risk of outsourcing production.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.649
He seemed like the enterprising type.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.569
-He screwed me over.
-How does that work, legally?

02:32.735 --> 02:36.739
The workshop foreman is responsible.
But we have to cover our backs, you know?

02:36.823 --> 02:38.032
I don't, spell it out.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.246
The papers for that contract
are a little iffy.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.624
What matters is that
we aren't connected to the factory.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.085
If that happens,
it'll get nasty for us both.

02:49.168 --> 02:52.922
I can't believe how pragmatic you are,
how devious!

02:53.006 --> 02:55.717
How can you sleep with those people's
deaths on your consciousness?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.594
You're a real mystery.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.221
A mystery?
This is not the time for mysteries.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.557
This can be handled,
but it could go to hell.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.810
For my granddaughter's sake,
you should talk to Jáuregui.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.188
-Why should I talk to Jáuregui?
-He can delay the case.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.774
And you're as much
an owner of this business as me.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.693
You're legally responsible too.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.904
I didn't hire anyone
or set up an illegal sweatshop.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.697
Partnership is like this!

03:17.780 --> 03:20.450
You can't just abandon ship
when a little leak appears.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.161
I'm not speaking to Jáuregui,
ask me something else!

03:23.328 --> 03:26.706
There is no something else.
He's dying to get close to his daughter.

03:26.789 --> 03:30.168
-Give him conditions, negotiate.
-Elena is not a bargaining chip.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.296
He's the father, it's his right.
You won't be able to avoid it.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.673
I won't speak to Jáuregui.
I'll set up the factory here.

03:35.757 --> 03:39.385
-What? No, no. You'll talk to him.
-That way I'll control everything.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.804
Edha! You can't pull this off.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.946
[doll talks happily]

03:59.030 --> 04:01.282
You've got it looking good. Very tidy.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.869
I've had it like this for two years,
since dad let me in.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.537
He was still waiting for you.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.499
-Not the same, but I do a good job.
-Good.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.504
I need a favor.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.424
I need your 15 best seamstresses.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.509
Talk to Dad.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.095
-Joseph won't see me.
-Forgiveness sets you free.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.430
If your repentance is sincere,
Dad will forgive you.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.015
Why should I be repentant?

04:27.016 --> 04:30.645
I won't ask forgiveness for choosing.
Do you know what that's like?

04:31.354 --> 04:34.482
[doll cries]

04:39.279 --> 04:42.031
[man speaks Hebrew in background]

04:49.163 --> 04:50.665
What do you need, son?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.793
[Antonio] I need your help.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.419
[salesperson] Hello.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.880
Can I help you?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.217
Is that for men?

05:56.272 --> 05:57.690
Are you taking it?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.193
No.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.496
You're not paying attention.
How does this look on me?

06:12.288 --> 06:14.457
-Are those pajamas?
-Shut up.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.209
It's from my mom's new collection.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.960
[Delfina] It's great! Give me one.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.130
Yeah. Shall I wear this?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.257
Elen, it's your dad, not some guy.

06:24.008 --> 06:26.844
-I don't know if I'm going yet.
-But didn't he ask you?

06:27.220 --> 06:30.473
Yeah, he's called me a thousand times,
but I didn't pick up.

06:30.973 --> 06:34.310
-I haven't told him I'm going.
-You want to see him?

06:34.811 --> 06:37.021
Yes, I'm intrigued. I don't know him.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.398
Do you want to see him?
You have to decide.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.400
[knocking on door]

06:42.735 --> 06:45.696
-What is it, Dad?
-Are you staying much longer?

06:45.780 --> 06:49.158
-I was just leaving, Julián!
-I'm... I'm speaking with my daughter.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.952
He's leaving, Daddy.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.707
Because of me.
He doesn't say anything about her.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.417
He gets jealous, love.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.506
[footsteps move closer]

07:06.050 --> 07:08.594
-Ele... one moment.
-Yes?

07:09.178 --> 07:12.390
-What's up with this kid, Sebastián?
-What's up?

07:12.473 --> 07:15.560
-Yeah, I mean, is he a good kid?
-Good how?

07:15.643 --> 07:17.186
Does he smoke? What does he do?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.314
Why are you asking me?

07:20.398 --> 07:24.026
It's difficult for me to talk
to your friend, you know how she is.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.655
It'd help if you could talk to her.
You know smoking isn't cool.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.158
[cellphone rings]

07:31.242 --> 07:34.162
Excuse me, it's my dad. Hello?

07:34.245 --> 07:36.622
So? Have you thought
where you want us to go?

07:36.706 --> 07:38.332
[Elena]  No, I haven't thought about it.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.128
I know a place you'd love.
Japanese food, do you like it?

07:42.211 --> 07:44.172
Yeah, but I don't know, I have to study.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.507
Think about it and I'll call you back.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.301
Hmm? Kisses.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.014
[Julián] So, Ele?

07:55.933 --> 07:57.101
Bye, see you.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.652
Old-man Barcutti has finally resigned
from the court, I'm a clear candidate.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.821
We have half the votes.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.031
[chuckles]

08:10.114 --> 08:11.157
I'm happy for you.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.367
[sighs]

08:13.451 --> 08:14.869
And Elena? Any news from her?

08:15.953 --> 08:17.997
No, she'll agree to it soon.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.137
Oh ho!

08:33.846 --> 08:35.181
Look.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.766
Look who's there.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.518
The foreman's little brother.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.521
Another son of a bitch.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.317
[laughter]

08:47.485 --> 08:50.363
Take care of yourself,
or you'll end badly.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.749
This is Edha.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.378
[inhales deeply]

09:05.461 --> 09:07.213
I know this is important to you.

09:07.922 --> 09:11.050
You're forgetting Medina.
Either he looks for you or for me.

09:11.133 --> 09:15.221
[man talking on street below]

09:15.304 --> 09:18.766
[Latin music plays over stereo]

09:24.188 --> 09:27.191
[Latin music continues]

09:27.275 --> 09:28.276
Go on.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.487
Stick your butt out, baby! A little more!

09:31.862 --> 09:33.072
Come on, get back.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.450
Show yourself! Head up. Come here.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.287
Little shit. Go on, with feeling.
Swing your hips.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.164
Straight. Swing your hips more.
Come here, baby.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.254
Go on.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.382
[Yastin] What did I say about the heels?

09:51.465 --> 09:53.634
Take them home
and learn to walk in them!

10:08.190 --> 10:09.483
Ow!

10:14.614 --> 10:16.365
[inhales deeply]

10:50.483 --> 10:53.694
[Edha]  Odette's death, my mother's death,
this drawing...

10:54.195 --> 10:56.947
...it's all part of the same weave,
the same pattern.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.367
A circle I can't escape from.

11:04.705 --> 11:08.334
-I want Dad to come.
-He'll come soon, Edha.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.128
INÉS MUSCCINI R.I.P.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.261
[Edha]  Odette held me, comforted me.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.973
She told me what she had to,
and hid from me what she had to.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.811
But I knew everything.
My mother had killed herself...

11:26.894 --> 11:29.105
...she had gone, she had left me alone.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.485
My father wasn't in the city,
he came back as soon as he could.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.570
[Lorenzo] Edha!

11:37.571 --> 11:42.243
[Edha]  My life, my mind, everything I do
is trapped inside that moment

11:42.326 --> 11:43.411
and in that hug.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.331
I came as soon as I could.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.584
[voice fades] I promise
I'll never leave you alone again.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.765
I've got it. I have the case.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.143
Well...

12:08.561 --> 12:09.687
What's the strategy?

12:10.479 --> 12:13.983
The usual. All guns on the foreman.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.111
Let him take the hit
for the sweatshop fire.

12:18.904 --> 12:23.117
-Who's the judge?
-An examining magistrate, Ocampo.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.327
Expensive.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.624
You can't have it all.
Cover yourself, all the same.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.126
Give Jáuregui a call.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.796
-I think you understand me.
-Yeah.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.091
I understand. I'll have to do it myself.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.637
Look, horse 5, Mimosa, paid up well.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.764
Besides, it's from a friend's stud.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.186
-Have you played?
-No, horses are too boring for me.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.731
Until one changes your life.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.491
Yes, it caught fire but...

13:03.949 --> 13:06.327
...I don't think a case should be opened.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.704
That's the symptom of the disease.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.915
How many fires have there been this year?

13:11.749 --> 13:14.919
-Five?
-Six, and four on the same block.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.797
With you, the case would go
to a federal judge.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.175
Yes, it would take on a bigger dimension.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.846
There are plenty of reasons
to put together a slavery case.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.598
Why should I help you?

13:28.641 --> 13:31.143
The impact on the media could be big.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.188
So much light can be blinding.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.149
-How is your baby?
-A baby.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.570
As District Attorney,

13:41.654 --> 13:44.448
I'll make your support public,
if you'll give it to me.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.992
-I think you stand to gain a lot.
-Hmm.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.120
-A lot of enemies, basically.
-No, prestige.

13:50.204 --> 13:54.041
This would help your candidacy
for Minister of the Supreme Court.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.877
-Hmm, smoke if you want.
-Eh? No, I'm quitting.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.922
And who's responsible for this fire?

14:04.843 --> 14:05.678
Lorenzo Abadi.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.266
[exhales deeply]

14:11.725 --> 14:13.143
That's why you came?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.689
Your baby must cry less than mine,
he lets you think.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.316
-It's a she, Lucía.
-That's cute.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.027
-She's the reason I'm quitting smoking.
-Good call.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.200
This isn't a time
to draw attention to myself.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.703
I prefer to keep a low profile.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.830
It's worked so far.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.668
Think about it.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.268
Hey!

14:55.728 --> 14:57.354
What is it with your boyfriend?

14:58.355 --> 15:01.066
-Did he forget he owes me?
-No, he didn't.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.069
Stuff happened,
but he's taking care of it.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.280
-Ah, he's taking care of it?
-Yes.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.743
What are you doing here, Medina?
Scram. This isn't your turf.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.705
One week.
It's what we need to get the money.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.124
You have 48 hours.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.208
Hmm?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.794
And you, don't play tough with me.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.595
-Do something or Teo's a goner.
-I don't know what to do.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.473
-I can help you.
-No, thank you.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.434
Favors from people like you
are too expensive.

[indistinct chatter]

16:00.167 --> 16:01.669
[quietly] Hello.

16:05.089 --> 16:05.965
Where's Edha?

16:06.465 --> 16:07.341
I don't know.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.344
This idea. All these friends of yours.
I told her no.

16:11.011 --> 16:14.181
This is preposterous, insane.
You're not helping her like this.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.595
[door creaks open]

16:55.180 --> 16:56.765

17:08.027 --> 17:09.862

[heavy breathing]

17:22.916 --> 17:25.669
[heavy breathing]

17:50.486 --> 17:53.739
-Enough, Edha, I'll get asthma.
-[Edha] Just a bit more.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.366
I get what it is you want.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.660
-What?
-[Antonio] Oppressive.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.663
-No.
-Suffocating.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.751
No. Feel it. Don't you feel it?

18:05.834 --> 18:09.088
Tight? I can't think of the word.
Clingy. Like a wetsuit.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.589
[Edha] A refuge.

18:11.548 --> 18:15.719
I want the garment to be a refuge
for the body.

18:15.803 --> 18:19.139
-[Antonio] That's what I said.
-No, you didn't.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.266
-I made you say it.
-[Edha] Not the same!

18:21.350 --> 18:24.770
That's how we work. Let's go!
Really, I'm not feeling well.

18:28.690 --> 18:29.775
I have it.

18:32.986 --> 18:36.323
[Edha] We're going to start
a new collection inspired by this design.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.910
[rapping]  When I improvise
You know you're vaporized

18:39.993 --> 18:41.870
You see that kid cross his eyes

18:41.954 --> 18:43.956
Each time I do it, he's hypnotized

18:44.039 --> 18:45.457
I keep doing it, permanent

18:45.541 --> 18:47.709
I'll kill you, and it won't be symbolic

18:47.793 --> 18:51.004
I hear you rap and it sounds ironic

18:51.088 --> 18:52.798
You say you're bad, a diabolic rogue

18:52.881 --> 18:56.135
Oh! I don't want to be an extra
I want the main role!

18:56.635 --> 19:00.764
She didn't say you shouldn't come anymore.
She said you should come less.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.599
I don't go that often.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.145
I know. She says we lack
"family intimacy." It's bullshit.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.021
-What's up?
-Her mom hates me.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.231
[Delfina] She doesn't hate you.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.567
-Your mom?
-Yes.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.152
They're probably not fucking.

19:13.986 --> 19:14.903
Right.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.948
What? People over 30 don't fuck anymore.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.158
[shouting in background]

19:19.241 --> 19:22.536
-Speaking of fucking, what's up with Mati?
-No, I didn't like it.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.581
He's not very good.
You can tell he isn't experienced.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.332
Neither do you.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.501
[Elena] Exactly. It's done, over.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.548
It's a shame we can't go.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.051
-You will come to my place.
-Do what I do.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.555
When my mom breaks my balls,
I go to my dad's.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.182
I don't have another house.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.310
Didn't your dad come back?

19:47.436 --> 19:49.021
That's it, dude. Seize the moment.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.398
Now I'm grownup,
he wants to get to know me?

19:52.024 --> 19:56.028
-I want to meet him, but my mom doesn't.
-How do you know he didn't before?

19:57.154 --> 19:59.740
Maybe your mom got pissed at him
and fed you bullshit.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.992
Isn't 16 years too long for bullshit?

20:02.326 --> 20:04.328
No. For real, no.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.956
A dad who doesn't want you is awful...

20:08.874 --> 20:10.667
...but one who doesn't even know you...

20:11.418 --> 20:13.295
-Come on, dude. We're up.
-Let's go.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.713
Let's go. You got my stuff?

20:16.757 --> 20:19.134
We're on it. You got something for me?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
Sure thing.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.848
-Trading is the future. That's on the tab.
-Right.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.726
Is he so bad in bed?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.062
Like a titi monkey?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.980
[panting, laughter]

20:34.024 --> 20:36.026
[sewing machines whir]

20:53.210 --> 20:55.420
-Don't step on the basting.
-Yes, yes, I know.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.714
Hey, Edha, Esther knows.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.926
Use the overlock
so the fabric doesn't fall to pieces.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.428
Be careful with the other one,
it's elasticized.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.893
[sewing machine whirs]

21:10.644 --> 21:13.689
-She still likes you.
-Shut up, that was in 1820.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.816
-She's not losing any hope.
-You think?

21:16.316 --> 21:17.818
How long? They seem slow.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.820
-They just started.
-I don't care when...

21:19.903 --> 21:21.947
...I care about when they finish.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.283
You took a big risk
promising this to the investors.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.701
I knew it'd be a rush.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.921
On the edge, unscrupulously...

21:38.672 --> 21:41.341
...that's how she lived
and how she died, poor Odette.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.439
It's complicated, Lorenzo.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.107
Nothing you can't fix.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.401
You overestimate me.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.322
What happened was serious.
Several casualties. Tough.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.532
Yes, a tragedy.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.243
And it could've been prevented,
of course, but...

22:08.744 --> 22:11.997
...people get drunk at work,
take drugs that knock out an elephant,

22:12.080 --> 22:17.044
they don't take care of the facilities.
Clumsy, rustic people. I'm not judging.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.838
The kid seemed trustworthy
and I helped him.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.009
I wouldn't be where I am today
if people hadn't given me a hand too.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.221
It was almost an act of charity,
what you did. It's touching.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.392
No intention of cutting costs
or increasing productivity,

22:32.476 --> 22:34.686
or dodging taxes
or workers' compensations.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.773
We're talking about
works of charity, basically.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.400
What world are you living in, Luciano?

22:41.651 --> 22:45.363
Don't overplay your progressive origins,
you live in the same world as me.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.326
What is it now? You suddenly found love?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.537
My granddaughter is 16 years old.

22:54.206 --> 22:58.543
You showing up has nothing to do
with your candidacy and the vote.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.090
As an employer,
you need to know who you're hiring.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.134
Directly or indirectly.
I'm not about to explain that to you.

23:06.676 --> 23:09.513
You have to know
what conditions your staff is working in.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.431
Because that's what they are.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.602
What a tricky subject, responsibility.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.565
Sometimes one realizes
a little late, right?

23:21.983 --> 23:24.069
I'm glad, all the same.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.948
Elena having a "Dad" again.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.412
Are you blackmailing me?

23:35.288 --> 23:41.294
No. Life gives us the chance
to help each other.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.463
I'm not going to go against that.

23:47.425 --> 23:48.969
[Lorenzo] Pour him a whiskey, Marita.

24:06.736 --> 24:11.575
-Excuse me, the bathroom?
-It's not here. This is my room. Mom?

24:11.658 --> 24:14.411
-I was told there's one here I can use.
-Who told you that?

24:14.995 --> 24:19.541
No, no, it's my bathroom,
it isn't available, sorry. Mom?

24:19.958 --> 24:20.959
What is it?

24:21.042 --> 24:23.503
The lady needs the bathroom.
Let her use yours.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.800
The other one must be free now,
you can go there.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.552
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.723
-This is supposed to be my home too.
-It isn't "supposed to be," it is.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.892
No, now the whole house
is your new factory.

24:37.517 --> 24:41.271
Why don't you sleep over at Delfi's, love,
and we'll sort all this out tomorrow?

24:41.354 --> 24:42.480
Yeah, I'll do that.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.566
I really need to do this.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.402
It's my last chance with the investors.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.321
Why does my dad show up now?

24:50.447 --> 24:53.241
I don't answer his texts
and he keeps pushing to meet.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.619
I don't know.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.583
I know you don't want me to,
but I'll have to see him.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.212
-I'll have to do it sooner or later.
-Do what you feel is right.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.679
[indistinct chatter]

25:24.397 --> 25:28.068
[Yastin] Let's see. Look at me. That's it.
Open your mouth a little, more sexy.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.111
There, let's see your profile.

25:32.489 --> 25:38.828
Take your hair away from your neck.
Show me your neck, there! I love it!

25:42.749 --> 25:43.959
Now your back.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.254
Lift your ass up. Look at me. There!

25:49.464 --> 25:54.261
My birthday wish has come true.
Tie me up tightly. Let me see.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.888
-Don't fuck me around, Yastin.
-What do you want?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.266
-Lift your chin up.
-Edha, where does she live?

25:59.683 --> 26:02.185
-I can't help you.
-Don't treat me like a moron.

26:04.312 --> 26:05.772
With a lover's expression.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.858
That's not a lover's expression.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.902
I help because I want to.

26:12.612 --> 26:15.031
Look at me, darling. One more.

26:15.907 --> 26:16.908
Write this down.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.374
Until Elena leaves,
we don't move from here.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.584
It's late now anyway.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.796
OK, I'm off.

26:31.131 --> 26:34.551
-Call me if anything happens, OK?
-What could happen? It's my dad.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.929
-Whatever it is, call me. I know him.
-Mom, I want to see him.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.891
-See you later.
-Take care.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.935
-Take care.
-Bye.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.607
If I didn't have to go,
I'd follow her.

26:49.941 --> 26:50.984
Lucky you can't.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.663
[Edha]  Did you confirm everything,
before we leave?

27:18.261 --> 27:20.221
[doorbell buzzes]

27:23.058 --> 27:25.310
[doorbell buzzes]

27:37.364 --> 27:39.783
Teo left. I don't know where he is.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.036
You said you could help me with Medina?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.083
You wear nail polish?

27:51.836 --> 27:53.755
I groom myself, when I have time.

27:56.716 --> 27:57.675
What?

27:58.551 --> 28:01.721
-Nothing, it's funny.
-Why? It's super funky.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.808
My grandfather says "super funky."

28:06.434 --> 28:09.521
It's the "latest fashion."
You prefer it if I say that?

28:11.856 --> 28:14.275
You said, "It's funny,"
but you're not laughing.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.612
It's nice when you laugh.

28:18.571 --> 28:19.948
[Jáuregui] You know?

28:22.117 --> 28:23.159
I'm not an old man.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.620
Neither is grandpa,
but he says "super funky."

28:25.703 --> 28:27.747
But your grandpa really is an older man.

28:28.498 --> 28:31.626
This is nothing.
Did you know there's makeup for men now?

28:31.709 --> 28:33.294
Not here, abroad.

28:33.378 --> 28:37.006
There's under eye concealer,
foundation, lipstick, too...

28:37.799 --> 28:41.970
Sergio, oh! Fantastic! Thanks, Sergio.
This is my daughter.

-Hi.
-Thank you.

[inhales and exhales deeply]

28:49.227 --> 28:52.439
-It's time you also know the truth.
-And what's the truth?

28:54.274 --> 28:57.819
-It sure isn't what you were told.
-You're saying my mom lied to me?

28:58.987 --> 28:59.988
No.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.992
I know I made a mistake...

29:04.951 --> 29:07.454
...but I didn't get the chance
to make things right.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.667
This isn't the first time
I've tried to see you.

And Salvador, your brother.

[Bárbara] Hello, Elena.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.443
-[Delfina] What's up, Ele?
-Hi. Thanks for coming.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.487
It's all right, how could I not come?

29:41.696 --> 29:44.324
-Are you all right?
-No, I feel really sick. I threw up.

29:44.824 --> 29:45.950
Gross.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.620
Did you tell your mom to come?

29:49.037 --> 29:52.665
No. I told my dad she was coming so
he'd leave, I couldn't stand it anymore.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.584
-So she isn't coming?
-No.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.046
OK, let's go to my place. Can you walk?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.131
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's go.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.175
-Grab the backpack.
-Yeah, obviously.

30:03.384 --> 30:06.471
-I never did this before.
-You want to help him or not?

30:07.096 --> 30:09.432
From two boyfriends to none is not good.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.019
You'll do fine. If you like it,
keep doing it. If not...

30:13.853 --> 30:15.063
What do you want?

30:15.855 --> 30:19.067
You were supposed to quit all this
and go straight with the agency.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.737
The agency isn't turning a profit. Look.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.032
I have to do something,
and this is what I know.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.035
Teo can't find out.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.580
[Yastin] He won't.
Pay me back the favor some time.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.582
Get going.

-[in English] Bye.

Aren't you going to say hello?

31:19.002 --> 31:20.003
[Celia] Hello.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.132
[laughter]

31:25.133 --> 31:26.342
It wasn't necessary.

31:28.386 --> 31:29.596
-Does it hurt?
-No.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.222
-Does it hurt?
-No.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.016
Let's see, open your mouth wide.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.227
[Julián] It's nothing.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.771
[Julián] Delfina did the right thing
bringing you.

31:38.855 --> 31:42.150
-I already know what it was.
-Now that I've seen you, you know.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.986
Then it was just a hypothesis.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.322
Something you ate didn't agree with you.

31:47.405 --> 31:51.075
Tomorrow, a healthy diet.
Lots of liquids, no alcohol, please.

31:51.826 --> 31:55.371
If you throw up tomorrow, let me know,
or your friend does. OK? Relax.

32:01.085 --> 32:04.088
You should've seen them.
The perfect family. So depressing.

32:04.172 --> 32:07.342
Whenever there's a baby it seems perfect.
Did you tell your mom?

32:07.425 --> 32:08.718
What?

32:08.801 --> 32:11.346
-That you threw up, dummy.
-No, are you crazy?

32:12.263 --> 32:14.265
She'll say seeing him isn't good for me.

32:15.558 --> 32:17.936
Maybe my dad's right
and the food messed you up.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.771
It wasn't the food, Del.

32:20.605 --> 32:24.442
-It was the perfect family and that baby.
-OK, we don't say anything to your mom.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.527
The one time I'm being responsible...

32:27.487 --> 32:28.821
You're not pregnant?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.199
Shut up, asshole. With who?

32:32.575 --> 32:34.827
-How?
-I don't know.

32:35.453 --> 32:39.290
-[Antonio] This where Inés kept her work?
-[Edha] Yes.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.251
[Edha] Incredible! It's a huge production.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.505
Considering all the stuff
in museums and private collections...

32:45.797 --> 32:47.799
-Can you sell Inés's collections?
-No.

32:48.174 --> 32:51.761
Odette left a will with a lot of clauses,
we have to wait for the succession.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.389
If it was tough before,
it's even harder now.

32:54.472 --> 32:57.141
Pity. There are things
that are great for the workshop.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.352
So young...

33:01.187 --> 33:02.689
So much work...

33:04.065 --> 33:05.400
Very prolific.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.652
She was your age when she died.
If you had a stroke--

33:07.735 --> 33:10.154
If it comes to that,
I'd prefer a heart attack.

33:11.572 --> 33:14.200
It wouldn't be bad.
I die at the same age mom did.

33:14.283 --> 33:17.787
And where would I put all your production
if you die of a heart attack?

33:18.121 --> 33:19.247
I'd better go.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.916
I don't want to witness your death,
least of all here.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.378
-That would be the final straw.
-Go home to see your girls.

33:25.753 --> 33:26.671
To the workshop.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.133
-Where do we stand on that?
-Tight, but we'll make it.

34:07.086 --> 34:09.047
[Edha]  My mother would hate me
for being here...

34:09.464 --> 34:13.217
...for going through her stuff, for not
moving forward without her memory.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.721
But Odette's death
opened a door to the past.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.307
A past I cannot leave behind.

34:21.768 --> 34:25.146
She meant everything to my mother,
like a part of her body.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.441
Their lives are as connected
as their deaths.

34:33.988 --> 34:36.032
Her suicide wasn't for the audience.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.326
Odette gave me a sign...

34:39.077 --> 34:43.081
It's a message for me.
A message only I can figure out.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.257
[Edha] Have her wait. I'm picking her up.

35:00.723 --> 35:03.851
[motorcycle revs engine]

35:06.604 --> 35:08.773
[On TV]  This debate is about fanaticism.

35:09.315 --> 35:14.153
Fanaticism is essentially denying
the possibility of discussing the topic.

35:14.570 --> 35:18.533
The fanatic believes, or doesn't believe,
without caring about the arguments.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.495
In some cases, this belief--

35:26.457 --> 35:27.834
They're coming to pick me up.

35:31.838 --> 35:32.755
Thank you.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.592
Don't miss getting to know your dad.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.153
-Sorry I'm late, I had an awful day.
-Please.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.989
-And I'm the one who's always late.
-Don't worry about it.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.950
-I could've gone in a cab.
-It's late.

36:01.033 --> 36:02.869
-And you're feeling sick.
-I'm not.

36:04.912 --> 36:07.123
-Thanks, Monina.
-Take care.

36:17.925 --> 36:21.220
-[Edha] Tell me how it went with Jáuregui.
-Normal.

36:21.304 --> 36:24.223
Ah, normal isn't possible with your dad.
No, not that.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.559
-What is it?
-Inés's stuff.

36:27.685 --> 36:31.314
-[Edha] Tell me how it went.
-I don't know, Mom. Fine, normal.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.900
"Fine, normal"? Let's see now.

36:35.693 --> 36:38.738
He took you for Japanese or Thai,
definitely Asian.

36:39.739 --> 36:43.576
He sat close enough to make you feel
uncomfortable at first and special later.

36:45.411 --> 36:47.747
He showed trust,
though he doesn't know you.

36:48.122 --> 36:50.583
He asked what you wanted to order,

36:50.666 --> 36:53.502
but when the waiter came
he ordered something else for you.

36:54.921 --> 36:55.963
Yeah.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.216
You thought he'd made a mistake,
he hadn't.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.968
If there's one thing he can teach you,
it's to eat well.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.722
You both laughed, he was all charming,
in the end he made you puke.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.098
How do you know?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.809
Monina told me you threw up.

37:08.893 --> 37:12.230
-Yeah, but the rest?
-I was your age when I met your father.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.357
He charms and wraps you up
until you choke.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.734
Then he disappears.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.404
Don't worry, I'm here.
That isn't going to happen to you.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.282
Maybe that happened to you.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.701
Might not happen to me.

37:34.543 --> 37:35.711
[Elena] Watch out!

37:45.054 --> 37:49.016
[breathes heavily]

37:55.356 --> 37:58.234
[gasps]

37:59.944 --> 38:01.028
Are you OK?

38:08.035 --> 38:09.954
