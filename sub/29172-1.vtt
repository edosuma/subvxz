00:54.179 --> 00:56.341
- Hi.
- Well, hey, there, Zak.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.089
How are you doing?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.636
I'm good, thank you.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.100
Hmm.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.389
I meant your pudding.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.854
Oh, silly me.
Here's your pudding.

01:04.855 --> 01:06.643
Thank you,
and have a nice day.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.357
Well, you do the same, hon.

01:34.386 --> 01:35.752
What a great style.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.717
I thought you had...
Well, you have that.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.472
Oh, my God,

01:40.517 --> 01:42.554
if you could get me
a little bit of a refill,

01:42.603 --> 01:44.595
that would make it 110%...

01:44.646 --> 01:46.808
You want a little
spice in there?

01:46.857 --> 01:48.314
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.477
Hey, Zak,
that is so sweet of you

01:52.529 --> 01:54.145
to give Rosemary your pudding.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.530
That's why I'm being
a very nice guy.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.950
Now.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.504
Give me a hand.
I got you.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.842
Zak!

03:32.754 --> 03:34.666
I don't know.
I'd love to have a nickel

03:34.715 --> 03:37.879
for every goddamn time
we've had to watch this tape.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.133
I'd be a rich 'un.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.613
<i>Salt Water, some people claim</i>

03:40.637 --> 03:42.048
<i>the Atomic Throw
is impossible.</i>

03:42.305 --> 03:43.967
<i>Those people are wimps!</i>

03:44.015 --> 03:45.301
<i>If you believe in yourself,</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:48.384
<i>like the Salt Water Redneck
believes in himself,</i>

03:48.437 --> 03:52.477
<i>you too can learn the moves,
the skills,</i>

03:52.524 --> 03:54.231
<i>the Atomic Throw.</i>

03:55.527 --> 03:57.894
<i>Some of these moves
are outlawed</i>

03:57.946 --> 03:59.278
<i>in international countries.</i>

04:00.615 --> 04:03.323
We have watched that throw
10 times today already.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.031
I love Salt Water Redneck,

04:06.079 --> 04:07.490
and he is my hero,

04:07.539 --> 04:11.078
and he is totally...
He is totally a badass.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.039
And he is the greatest
person ever.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.373
That's it.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.005
And you will be
the next badass.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.800
Zak, both you and Rosemary

04:24.848 --> 04:26.384
have lost your privileges
for the week.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.470
Oh, I really don't care.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.725
Oh.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.181
I got the solution
for that.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.846
Move Rosemary in here
with him and I.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.640
I can keep an eye
on both of them.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.058
Huh!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.271
That'd be great.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.902
Okay. I'll set that right up.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.278
Yeah, sure.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.064
Zak, this is not a joke.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.779
That's twice now, two times
that you've tried to run.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.784
And now I have to
label you a flight risk.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.737
That sucks.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.590
Is this what you gave
to Rosemary to convince her

04:57.631 --> 04:58.997
to pretend to be choking?

04:59.049 --> 05:00.540
Yes, it is.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.379
It's really creative.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.130
Thank you.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.546
Not just creative.
It's genius.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.390
You know why?
That's an advertisement

05:09.434 --> 05:12.097
for what he wants to do
with the rest of his life!

05:12.145 --> 05:14.728
- Carl.
- I don't know her.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.765
I am young,

05:16.817 --> 05:18.729
and I am not old.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.734
Carl is old.

05:20.779 --> 05:24.113
And we are different.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.399
And I don't know why
I am here.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.864
I wish I had a better option
for you, Zak.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.244
But I don't.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.247
You don't have a family
that can provide

05:33.291 --> 05:34.702
adequate supervision for you.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.661
I know. So the state
has to put you somewhere,

05:38.713 --> 05:41.376
and this just happens
to be that place.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.541
You been here two years?

05:44.010 --> 05:46.502
Two and a half years.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.591
We got to fix that.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.591
Just try to be good, okay?

05:51.643 --> 05:52.759
Look at me.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.518
Tell me you'll try.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.561
Fine.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.064
Tyler.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.191
Hey, Tyler.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.572
Yo.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.530
Duncan and Ratboy
are looking for you.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.226
And they're going
to beat your ass.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.686
They're going to kill you
if you keep shitting

06:16.710 --> 06:18.246
- with their crab pot.
- All right.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.189
Turn that damn box off

06:20.213 --> 06:21.954
and listen to what
I'm telling you, boy.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.878
You been stealing
their damn crab pots.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.134
You know what that's going
to cost me?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.135
It's going to cost me
my damn license

06:29.180 --> 06:30.421
for this building here.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.260
What seems to be your problem?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.328
Best thing for you to do
is just quit

06:34.352 --> 06:35.684
with them damn fish and leave.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.437
Go home. Go, just go.
You done pissed me off now.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.542
- Let me finish the fish...
- Go. Get.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.647
Yeah, I know what I said.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.103
Go. Just go.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.462
Let me fix that hoist motor
and I'll leave.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.273
The hoist motor's been fixed.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.946
I need a job, Winkie.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.275
You just go.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.593
Hey, man.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.846
You can't be bringing me
illegal stuff no more.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.849
Duncan's fishing
on Mark's license.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.312
What am I supposed to do?

07:24.361 --> 07:26.728
- I would have bought it if...
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.564
Mark wouldn't want you
to do this.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.984
He's your brother and
he's looking down from above,

07:33.036 --> 07:34.277
thinking about you.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.116
Thinking about the wrong
you're doing.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.580
Get your life together.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.537
Get it in order.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.786
Mark would be proud of you
if you did that.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.540
He'd be very proud of you
if you did.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.325
Come on.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.954
Bedtime, retard.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.092
You put this all over
your body. It's soap.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.510
It'll make you slippery.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.972
I was an engineer before.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.164
I don't know
if I ever told you that.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.772
But that's as good
as I could get.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.353
Just slip through there,

08:47.402 --> 08:50.019
and off you go on your way.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.691
Okay, bud?

08:51.740 --> 08:55.780
Carl, you are my best friend.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.537
And... And you are my family.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.788
Well, that's it.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.830
Friends are the family
you choose.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.036
And, Carl?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.956
You are invited
to my birthday party.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.251
Oh, God. Thank you.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.135
I'm there.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.300
Go kick some ass.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.194
You pulled my pots?

10:59.242 --> 11:00.699
Huh?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.200
You stealing crab now?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.574
I'm been laying pots here
for years.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.662
Come on, Dunc!

11:05.707 --> 11:07.824
Powell's Point was Mark's,
but Mark is gone.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.208
Can't lay traps here no more.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.289
Well, I guess, uh, taking shit
that don't belong to you

11:11.296 --> 11:12.832
runs in the family, you know.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.622
You bitch.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.424
You got no license now.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.843
You know how things
are done around here, Tyler.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.096
There's 10 crabbing licenses
to go around Deer County.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.597
Put them hands on him, Dunc!

11:23.641 --> 11:24.677
Get him!

11:24.726 --> 11:26.137
This one used to
belong to Mark,

11:26.186 --> 11:27.768
but now it says Duncan...

11:29.772 --> 11:32.105
Kick him again, Dunc!

11:36.529 --> 11:38.145
You owe me 20 pots.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.565
Touch my gear again,

11:41.075 --> 11:43.818
I shit you not, I'll bash your
skull in with a tire iron.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.488
You hear that? You can't fish,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.031
and you sure as shit
can't fight.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.117
You're still doing accounting.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.812
Zak?

12:26.704 --> 12:27.945
Shit.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.160
Carl.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.332
What?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.043
Explain. What happened?

12:41.344 --> 12:42.801
Don't look at me.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.504
You were with the boy
every day.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.672
He's incredibly strong.

12:50.812 --> 12:51.270
E.
- What?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.139
Lee wants to see your ass
in his office right now.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.939
We are so screwed.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.153
I'm not done with you.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.318
I had nothing to do with it.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.810
You're a dead man, Tyler!

16:32.533 --> 16:33.774
Shh!

16:48.841 --> 16:50.082
Who are you?

16:50.885 --> 16:51.921
Uh...

17:31.759 --> 17:33.000
Fucking...

17:35.304 --> 17:36.920
Go, go, go, go, go.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.908
Yeah.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.194
Oh, hell, yeah.
Continental breakfast.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.248
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I...
I got to go.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.250
All right. Bye.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.124
- A flight risk?
- Yes, I...

18:14.176 --> 18:15.963
Looks like all that
family money of yours

18:16.012 --> 18:19.096
bought you a degree but didn't
get you no common sense.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.678
- I don't think that...
- Oh, don't speak.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.094
You let a half-naked boy
with Down syndrome

18:25.146 --> 18:27.854
who has no money, no family,

18:27.898 --> 18:30.060
and no idea how to get along
in this world

18:30.109 --> 18:33.022
just slip out from under
your nose into thin air.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.813
And you have no idea
where he is?

18:35.865 --> 18:37.322
Where he's at?
Who he might be with?

18:37.366 --> 18:38.823
- Actually, I...
- The nurses tell me

18:38.868 --> 18:40.109
you two are close.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.241
We are.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.282
Well, then you'll figure out
where he's at

18:46.334 --> 18:48.496
and you'll bring him back
before I have to report this

18:48.544 --> 18:49.751
to the state.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.582
No, Glen,
you have to report this.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.667
He's missing.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.207
Find him.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.871
You know that's just
trespassing, don't you?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.761
We have about 30 minutes

19:45.810 --> 19:47.267
before this whole
shit's underwater.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.041
Uh, excuse me!

20:12.586 --> 20:14.623
Will you please help me?

20:16.465 --> 20:18.627
I'm scared. I can't swim.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.931
Are you following me?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.152
You ain't got a lick
of water on you, do you?

20:43.826 --> 20:45.362
When I can leave you, I will.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.081
I feel great to go to

20:59.133 --> 21:03.173
Salt Water Redneck
Wrestling School.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.713
And everybody's going to say,
"Zak is awesome."

21:06.724 --> 21:08.636
I'm going to throw the people
out the ring.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.392
It'll be the Atomic Throw.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.679
And I can fight
all my friends.

21:13.731 --> 21:16.815
We'll have a party.
Having a good time.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.395
And I feel great.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.855
<i>Come to my wrestling school</i>

21:23.908 --> 21:25.695
<i>in Ayden, North Carolina.</i>

21:25.743 --> 21:29.202
<i>And become a disciple
of Salt Water Redneck.</i>

21:29.455 --> 21:32.038
<i>You can become
not only a badass,</i>

21:32.082 --> 21:33.789
<i>the badass.</i>

21:33.834 --> 21:35.871
<i>You will learn.</i>

21:38.881 --> 21:40.247
The end of the road.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.040
- You know my name?
- No.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.503
Good.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.918
This never happened, okay?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.427
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.255
Hey.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.432
Can I come with you?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.386
Why would I need you
to come with me?

21:54.438 --> 21:56.976
Maybe we could be friends,

21:57.775 --> 22:00.392
and buddies, bro dawgs,

22:00.444 --> 22:02.436
and hang and chill.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.024
Have a good time.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.151
Be good.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.159
Hey!

22:14.208 --> 22:16.666
Do you want to come
to my birthday party?

22:35.104 --> 22:36.595
Is she a good dog?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.555
Good enough.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.307
She don't run away,

22:40.359 --> 22:42.817
so I guess
that makes her mine.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.359
My wife's long gone.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.069
My kids are grown.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.154
We look out for each other.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.949
That's all right.

22:54.665 --> 22:55.997
Crazy, ain't it?

22:56.667 --> 22:59.034
- What's that?
- That fire down at the docks.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.245
There was a fire at the docks?

23:01.297 --> 23:02.378
Yeah.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.461
No shit. I didn't hear
nothing about that.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.584
Yeah. It started out small,

23:07.636 --> 23:10.128
but got out of hand
pretty fast.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.216
Did it?

23:11.265 --> 23:12.756
Some of them boys
are out right now

23:12.808 --> 23:14.720
trying to catch the guy
that lit it.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.433
They set up a roadblock
down 158.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.517
- 158, huh?
- Yeah.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.942
Shit, you know what?
I left something back there.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.155
I got to go back.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.140
You sure you don't want a ride
all the way into town?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.496
No, I forgot something
back there.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.701
I'm going right there.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.412
Oh, I appreciate it, thanks.

23:47.635 --> 23:48.967
Jump, retard, jump.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.377
No, I'm not gonna do it.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.157
I thought you were
a retard, not a pussy.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.013
- No, I'm not.
- Hey!

23:54.058 --> 23:56.721
- Come on, jump.
- No.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.476
- Do it!
- Hey, he can't swim.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.806
Like I care, dipshit.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.642
Come on, let's go.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.022
- What?
- You heard me.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.435
- No. No.
- Hey!

24:06.487 --> 24:08.524
- Come on, do it. Jump.
- I am not going to do it.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.925
- Come on, man.
- I said he can't swim.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.190
- Too bad. Do it.
- Hey!

24:11.241 --> 24:12.857
Jump, retard.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.054
Didn't I just say...

24:30.678 --> 24:32.635
You said there're wrestling
schools in Ayden?

24:33.180 --> 24:34.261
Yes.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.636
We're in Manteo.
That's right here.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.345
One long road leads
all the way down to Florida.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.639
That's where I'm going.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.808
Where you're going is Ayden.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.629
That's where
the wrestling school is

24:47.653 --> 24:48.689
you're talking about.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.104
You see that? It's on the way.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.051
You bullshitting me
about this wrestling school?

24:53.075 --> 24:54.111
You swear to God?

24:54.535 --> 24:56.743
Yes, I swear to God

24:56.787 --> 24:58.574
I have proof on the videotape.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.582
All right.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.333
I'll drop you there, then.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.620
I ain't doing no charity shit.
It's just on my way.

25:06.672 --> 25:07.913
Get up.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.507
So what is your name?

25:17.641 --> 25:18.802
Tyler.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.760
That is a very cool name.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.724
Excuse me.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.733
Have you seen
this young man anywhere?

25:29.778 --> 25:32.065
Have you seen him anywhere?
His name's Zak.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.530
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

25:34.616 --> 25:37.700
I'm just wondering if you have
seen this young man anywhere.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.279
My name's Eleanor.
I wrote it down right there.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.210
You see a dude
come through here?

25:51.258 --> 25:53.341
About this tall? Beard?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.001
A real piece of shit.
You seen him?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.966
Huh? What happened
to your face?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.074
What happened to your face?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.714
You seen him? Huh?

26:00.142 --> 26:01.223
Where'd he go?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.135
Tell me.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.941
What'd they know?

26:09.985 --> 26:11.772
They ain't seen shit.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.447
Hey, Tyler.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.533
My feet hurt.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.994
Do you have a car?

26:27.002 --> 26:28.243
Tyler?

26:29.671 --> 26:32.459
Can we walk on the road?

26:35.010 --> 26:36.967
Uh, excuse me?

26:38.388 --> 26:40.254
Will you please answer me?

26:40.891 --> 26:42.928
Let me tell you something.
I'mma tell you a story.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.262
I'm gonna tell you a story.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.428
When I was younger,
my brother and I were camping

26:46.480 --> 26:47.937
at this place
called Caffey's Inlet,

26:47.981 --> 26:49.084
and there was
a big-ass hornet's nest

26:49.108 --> 26:50.189
down by the water.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.461
So I walked over to them
all excited.

26:51.485 --> 26:52.976
I'm young, I'm into baseball.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.006
And I hit that son of a bitch
like a fucking home run.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.716
And it exploded on me,
and I got stung up real bad.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.481
My face swelled up,
my eyes got real tight,

26:58.534 --> 26:59.534
and I couldn't see shit.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.471
Walked back into camp and
my brother Mark said to me,

27:01.495 --> 27:02.555
"You keep stirring up shit,

27:02.579 --> 27:04.139
"you're gonna
get yourself killed, boy."

27:05.082 --> 27:06.448
You understand
what I'm saying?

27:06.500 --> 27:07.786
You ever kick a hornet's nest?

27:08.252 --> 27:09.493
Last night.

27:12.798 --> 27:13.798
You hit a hornet's nest
last night?

27:13.799 --> 27:14.915
Last night.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.126
So you understand why we can't
go up on that road then?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.425
Stop with this "Tyler" shit.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.135
We're gonna be quiet
the rest of the way.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.553
- Tyler.
- Oh, my...

27:29.148 --> 27:30.480
Finish what you got to say.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.669
Finish what you have to say,
and then we'll walk on silent.

27:32.693 --> 27:33.878
We're not gonna
do this no more.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.610
"Tyler, Tyler, Tyler,
Tyler," what?

27:37.322 --> 27:40.906
I want you to know about me.

27:41.326 --> 27:45.787
I am a Down syndrome person.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.377
I don't really give a shit.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.257
Do you got supplies on you?

27:58.302 --> 27:59.502
That's what we need, don't we?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.098
You got supplies?

28:06.143 --> 28:07.554
- No.
- No, you don't.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.222
No, you don't.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.016
No more, "Tyler, Tyler."
No more.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.230
You got any money?

28:21.241 --> 28:25.406
No. No, I have no money,
and I got no pockets.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.117
I'm gonna give you pockets.

28:33.587 --> 28:34.828
There's pockets.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.627
I'm going to go in there
and get essentials.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.166
- Can I come?
- No.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.481
- That'll be, uh...
- Let me get a sandwich.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.563
All right, then.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.570
That'll be...

29:00.614 --> 29:03.903
$13.83.

29:03.951 --> 29:04.987
What?

29:06.411 --> 29:07.993
Well, son,

29:08.038 --> 29:09.995
that sandwich alone
is four dollars.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.656
Well, forget the sandwich.
How much now?

29:11.708 --> 29:14.496
And your Ding Dongs,
they're two dollar apiece.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.580
And that's another $1.35.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.370
All right,
how about, uh...

29:17.923 --> 29:19.459
That, just that?

29:20.384 --> 29:22.501
Three dollars.
And call it even.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.464
Peanut butter.

29:24.513 --> 29:25.845
Yeah, all right. That'll work.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.075
Just the peanut butter
and fishhooks.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.215
Yes, sir.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.226
Uh, pardon me
if I seem alarmed but,

29:31.270 --> 29:33.557
I don't normally negotiate
with fellas if they got

29:33.605 --> 29:35.312
- shotguns all over their back.
- Oh, shit.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.773
I understand.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.394
- Ooh, thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.631
Hey, you got any of the, uh...

29:41.655 --> 29:44.693
You got any of them two-dollar
airplane whiskeys back there?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.198
No, but, uh...

29:49.788 --> 29:51.279
I got this.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.873
- Oh, I can't afford that.
- It's on me, son.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.910
It looks like you might
need it more than I do.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.330
I'm just going to get a little
swig to calm my nerves.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.126
Sure. Yeah.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.214
You made it?

30:06.263 --> 30:07.504
I did, sir.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.638
Ooh!

30:12.686 --> 30:13.722
Yeah, you did.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.974
Ma'am.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.309
Gentlemen.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.901
Sorry.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.825
Ma'am, you'll have to
forgive me for staring at you,

30:32.873 --> 30:34.489
but you're one of
the prettiest women

30:34.541 --> 30:36.077
I've seen in ages.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.747
Where did you
blow in here from?

30:39.796 --> 30:42.163
- Richmond. Mmm-hmm.
- Richmond? That's nice.

30:42.215 --> 30:45.583
So you, uh,
you graduated JMU, or GW?

30:45.969 --> 30:47.085
GW.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.094
Yeah. Yeah, you got
that look about you.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.533
Oh, yeah?
What kind of look is that?

30:50.557 --> 30:53.300
You know, just, uh, "excited
to be alive" kind of look.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.593
What you doing up here?

30:55.729 --> 30:56.936
You're nosy, aren't you?

30:56.980 --> 30:58.333
Yeah, nosy.
That's the word for it.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.314
Nosy. Or interested.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.316
- Interested?
- Yeah. Interested.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.727
Are you interested?

31:03.779 --> 31:05.190
No, I'm working.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.480
Working.
What, you working crab boats?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.740
No.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.012
I know, that's funny,
because you...

31:11.036 --> 31:12.347
I know why you think
that's funny.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.487
Oh, you're trouble. I see.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.279
Okay, you don't like jokes.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.698
I'm looking for
a missing person.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.286
Have either
of you gentlemen...

31:18.335 --> 31:21.544
I'm assuming I can use
the word "gentlemen."

31:21.588 --> 31:22.795
- Have you seen him?
- No.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.171
I ain't... I ain't seen him.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.041
Have you seen him?

31:27.677 --> 31:28.884
Why? What'd he do?

31:28.970 --> 31:30.882
He ran away from
the nursing home I work at.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.047
Why? Have you seen him?

31:32.099 --> 31:33.965
So you got some kind
of reward?

31:34.684 --> 31:35.891
No.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.809
What are you?
Are you a bounty hunter?

31:37.854 --> 31:40.813
Would I be a bounty hunter if
I just said there's no bounty?

31:40.857 --> 31:43.065
No. What are you, his sister?
Minder or something?

31:43.110 --> 31:44.601
Not that it's any
of your business,

31:44.653 --> 31:47.396
but I care about him,
and he's alone,

31:47.447 --> 31:49.063
- and I want to find him.
- Maybe.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.199
- Maybe? Maybe what?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.804
Well, maybe he's alone.
Maybe he ain't alone.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.055
You know, you don't know.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.241
What if he's living
the American dream and,

31:56.289 --> 31:58.576
you know, he just, uh, ran
into a bunch of hitchhikers?

31:58.625 --> 32:00.545
You know, like the Mark Twain
story or something.

32:00.585 --> 32:01.701
Mmm-hmm.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.994
You like Mark Twain?

32:04.172 --> 32:05.663
- Thank you.
- You like Louis L'Amour?

32:05.715 --> 32:07.502
You got a phone number?

32:07.551 --> 32:08.712
Yeah, I got a phone number.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.092
Yeah? You gonna give it to me?

32:10.137 --> 32:12.457
So I find him, what you want
me to do? Just holler for you?

32:12.681 --> 32:15.048
- Yeah, just do that.
- Yeah? You got a name?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.724
- Yeah, I got a name.
- What is it?

32:18.520 --> 32:19.556
Eleanor.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.596
Eleanor.

32:26.570 --> 32:27.686
All right, partner.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.437
Come back.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.957
You're a goddamn criminal.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.796
You're a goddamn criminal,
ain't you?

32:50.844 --> 32:52.961
Fugitive,
little man on the lam.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.304
Met your girlfriend
back there, Eleanor.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.340
Cute one from
the old folks' home.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.682
She likes you quite a bit.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.889
Got a picture of you and
everything, showing everybody.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.516
That's not a bad thing.

33:02.564 --> 33:03.833
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a good thing.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.223
See, we're going
70 miles upriver.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.516
We need a tie that binds.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.355
And this right here,
you being a wanted man,

33:08.403 --> 33:10.110
this is it, just the kind
of tie we needed.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.896
Hell, yeah.
Two bandits on the run.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.782
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah, partner. Come on.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.054
Hell, yeah!

33:21.249 --> 33:25.710
Listen, we got new rules now,
all right?

33:27.464 --> 33:29.000
We can't keep
doing it this way.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.381
New rule is,
you can't slow me down.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.712
You understand? Put those on.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.428
So, what I says go. I say,
"Jump," you say, "How high?"

33:36.473 --> 33:38.385
- How high?
- There it is.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.016
Rule number one,
don't slow me down

33:41.061 --> 33:42.927
Rule number two,
I'm in charge,

33:42.938 --> 33:44.578
and you're going to carry
your own weight.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.476
You are in charge.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.561
That's right.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.851
Uh, maybe we should...

33:49.903 --> 33:53.487
Maybe we should have our own
secret handshake.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.612
What kind of secret handshake?
For what?

33:56.993 --> 33:59.280
Buds, dudes, friends.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.029
Buds, dudes,
friends handshake?

34:01.081 --> 34:02.197
All right, come here.

34:02.249 --> 34:03.456
Let's go, hurry up.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.377
All right, three of those.
Four of those.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.540
Four of those. Now what?

34:14.302 --> 34:15.964
- Like that.
- Yeah.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.675
Only when special shit
happens, though, all right?

34:19.181 --> 34:20.547
Yeah. Special things.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.599
Special things.
You don't curse.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.760
- No.
- Why don't you curse?

34:23.812 --> 34:25.223
- Because I don't.
- Okay, come on.

34:26.898 --> 34:27.978
You are in charge.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.231
Exactly.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.391
Come on.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.065
Hey, what's rule number one?

34:40.620 --> 34:42.031
What's rule number one?

34:43.248 --> 34:44.864
- Party?
- No, not party.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.489
No, it's not party.
Don't slow me down.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.458
That's rule number one.
Let's go, come on.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.748
Come on, pick it up.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.504
There you go.
You got boots on now.

34:52.507 --> 34:53.918
Rule number one
is not "party."

34:53.925 --> 34:55.632
What is rule number one?

34:55.635 --> 34:57.797
"Don't slow me down."

34:57.846 --> 34:58.962
Rule number one?

34:58.972 --> 35:00.338
You are in charge.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.340
All right,
we'll figure it out.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.207
It is too...

35:36.259 --> 35:38.046
Too far from the other side.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.507
Yeah, well, we ain't got
many options.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.992
I'm not walking through
two days of brier bushes,

35:43.016 --> 35:44.848
and we can't go back
the way we came.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.385
So we're going swimming.
You got a better idea?

35:47.437 --> 35:50.350
We... We could get a plane.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.311
Take your pants off.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.855
- I can't swim.
- Yeah, I know you can't swim.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.236
But you can float.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.319
Zak, I need you
to listen to me.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.320
That bag and them pants
can hold air.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.288
They're going to float you.
Do not let go.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.824
You hold on with
everything you got,

36:09.876 --> 36:11.687
because I sure as shit don't
want to have to go swimming

36:11.711 --> 36:13.418
over there,
thinking about you sinking us.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.954
I don't want to dredge
the bottom for your body.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.080
You understand?

36:16.591 --> 36:17.752
Tyler...

36:18.051 --> 36:20.964
Am I going to die?

36:21.012 --> 36:23.049
Yeah, you're going to die.
It's a matter of time.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.116
That ain't the question.
The question is,

36:24.140 --> 36:25.785
whether they're going to have
a good story to tell about you

36:25.809 --> 36:27.769
when you're gone. Now,
don't be a bitch. Let's go.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.601
Don't cry, Zak.

36:41.658 --> 36:43.115
Hold on, Zak!

36:48.832 --> 36:50.073
Kick, Zak!

36:53.002 --> 36:54.413
Kick, Zak!

36:58.466 --> 36:59.923
Kick, Zak!

37:03.638 --> 37:05.504
Let's get out of here!

37:38.548 --> 37:41.916
That is the greatest story
to tell.

37:46.389 --> 37:47.630
Uh, come on.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.316
I ain't the slightest bit
scared of you.

39:23.069 --> 39:27.985
I... I want to be
professional wrestler.

39:27.991 --> 39:30.529
And I am a bad guy.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.903
Why do you wanna be
the bad guy?

39:34.789 --> 39:36.121
Because

39:37.292 --> 39:40.285
my family left me.

39:44.257 --> 39:46.044
That don't make you a bad guy.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.505
Good guys get left too, Zak.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.756
Ain't about no silly laugh,

39:53.766 --> 39:58.352
or wearing black,
and eye shadow and shit.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.765
Ain't nothing to do with that.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.889
It has to do with
what's in here, in your heart.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.482
You got a good-guy heart.

40:03.985 --> 40:05.754
You can't do shit about it.
That's just who you are.

40:05.778 --> 40:06.859
You're a hero.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.440
I can't be a hero, because...

40:12.702 --> 40:16.241
I am a Down syndrome.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.202
What's that got to do
with your heart?

40:19.792 --> 40:21.078
Who told you that?

40:22.086 --> 40:23.622
Coach. Teachers.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.129
Your coach?
What'd your coach say?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.883
I am retarded.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.885
Your coach said that?

40:33.932 --> 40:35.139
What a shitty coach.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.723
Your team ever win anything?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.343
No?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.147
Some shit you ain't
never gonna do.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.316
That's all right.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.352
You can't be everything.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.150
You ain't gonna be no

40:50.156 --> 40:52.318
professional
basketball player.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.150
You ain't gonna dunk
no basketball,

40:55.203 --> 40:56.569
or be an Olympic swimmer.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.446
You sink like a stone

40:59.457 --> 41:00.948
because you're all muscle.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.576
Muscle sinks.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.294
Today, you pulled me up
out that water,

41:06.297 --> 41:07.900
you almost pulled my whole arm
out the socket.

41:07.924 --> 41:08.924
Most grown folk I know

41:08.925 --> 41:10.336
ain't got
that kind of strength.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.460
You're strong, Zak.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.384
Fuck your coach.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.055
- Tyler...
- Yeah?

41:23.982 --> 41:27.441
Who those people
on the boat?

41:27.443 --> 41:28.729
On the boat?

41:28.736 --> 41:30.648
That's Duncan and Ratboy.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.779
They are a good guy
or a bad guy?

41:35.785 --> 41:37.071
Bad guy.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.579
- Tyler,
- Hmm?

41:41.082 --> 41:44.996
Are you the good guy
or a bad guy?

41:46.337 --> 41:47.748
I don't know.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.750
What you think?

41:51.884 --> 41:53.716
You are a good guy.

42:43.603 --> 42:45.469
What?

42:47.815 --> 42:49.602
Will you please train me?

42:50.818 --> 42:53.356
Yeah, I don't know shit
about wrestling.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.484
I want to learn.

42:57.742 --> 43:01.611
I want to be a hero.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.043
You know how
to do push-ups?

43:15.551 --> 43:16.792
Yeah?

43:18.846 --> 43:19.882
Let's go.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.176
Oh,
what do you want to do?

43:22.850 --> 43:24.466
We're gonna go train.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.635
Yeah.

43:27.396 --> 43:28.853
It's balance.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.229
This kicks back,
you understand?

43:35.154 --> 43:38.647
Always keep your hand
like that so you can steady.

43:39.283 --> 43:40.945
Hey, so, what's the deal
with Eleanor?

43:40.993 --> 43:42.985
- She's your friend?
- Yes.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.244
She's a nice woman?

43:44.288 --> 43:45.495
Mmm-hmm.

43:45.915 --> 43:46.996
What's she like?

43:47.041 --> 43:48.577
She, uh...

43:48.626 --> 43:50.333
She is my friend.

43:50.378 --> 43:54.122
And she has been
looking out for me.

43:54.173 --> 43:56.165
- She's your friend?
- Yeah.

43:56.217 --> 43:57.333
Cheers.

43:59.178 --> 44:00.464
Push, push, push. There it is.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.254
There it is!
There it is! Push!

44:02.306 --> 44:04.218
All right, point and fire.
Come on.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.098
You all right?

44:09.147 --> 44:10.729
Hey, you all right, boy?

44:16.279 --> 44:19.113
Get it! Get it! Get it!

44:27.456 --> 44:29.664
Come on. Push. Push.
Push. Push. Push.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.126
Grab my head.

44:36.757 --> 44:39.044
That bead and that bead
need to be lined up.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.129
Yeah, I got it.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.378
Little wider with your stance.

44:42.388 --> 44:45.631
All right, all right.
Three, two, one.

44:47.727 --> 44:49.639
- And I got them all.
- That's a buck shot.

44:50.980 --> 44:52.642
Good, good.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.435
Bam.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.498
We got to find a way
to move faster, all right?

45:30.061 --> 45:31.097
Yeah.

45:31.729 --> 45:32.845
Hey, this can work.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.687
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

45:34.732 --> 45:35.848
Mmm-hmm.

45:37.568 --> 45:38.684
You all right?

45:42.740 --> 45:43.981
Freeze, you son of bitches!

45:48.037 --> 45:50.324
You son of a bitches
think you can come over here

45:50.373 --> 45:52.365
and rob Jasper
just 'cause he's blind?

45:53.292 --> 45:55.750
Well, you better
think again, goddamn it.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.713
Y'all boys black or white?

46:03.928 --> 46:05.044
Okay.

46:05.096 --> 46:06.803
White!

46:07.765 --> 46:09.051
White!

46:09.100 --> 46:10.341
I knowed you was white.

46:10.393 --> 46:12.430
I could smell you a mile off.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.764
Is you God-fearing?

46:14.355 --> 46:15.391
Yup.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.395
Well, good.

46:27.952 --> 46:30.535
There's sheep in this world,

46:30.579 --> 46:32.946
and there are wolves
in this world.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.740
I may not have my eyes,

46:34.792 --> 46:37.250
but I know the difference.

46:37.837 --> 46:40.500
And I know that you
two boys are just two

46:41.132 --> 46:45.251
fleece-wearing weary travelers
who lost your way.

46:45.761 --> 46:47.923
Neither one of you are wolves.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.091
You're just sheep

46:49.557 --> 46:51.719
that strayed from his flock.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.892
I'm donating the supplies

46:54.937 --> 46:57.099
from my junkyard
for your pilgrimage.

46:58.899 --> 47:01.266
Anything but that tin boat,

47:01.319 --> 47:04.062
y'all can have it
because I figure it's my duty

47:04.113 --> 47:05.775
to get you back
to your shepherd.

47:08.367 --> 47:11.280
Now, I can't have you boys
running off of here

47:11.329 --> 47:13.446
with your hands all dirty
and everything,

47:13.497 --> 47:16.035
because a wolf
might hunt you down

47:16.083 --> 47:17.995
just by the smell
of your past sins.

47:19.962 --> 47:22.204
<i>And I wouldn't want no wolf
to get ahold of you,</i>

47:22.256 --> 47:24.543
<i>because that'd be
a frightful, bloody mess.</i>

47:25.092 --> 47:27.379
So, we gonna
clean you up right

47:29.055 --> 47:30.546
with a baptism.

47:31.349 --> 47:32.715
What's baptism?

47:32.767 --> 47:34.850
It's like swimming.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.726
Y'all boys come on down here

47:36.771 --> 47:39.684
and bathe in the warm waters
of forgiveness.

47:40.274 --> 47:43.017
I'm more of
"baptism by fire" type.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.485
Well, unfortunately,
I don't perform

47:45.529 --> 47:47.521
those kind of baptisms.

48:17.603 --> 48:20.437
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

48:21.315 --> 48:25.400
Nothing can touch you now,
under the grace of the Lord.

48:25.403 --> 48:26.519
Bye, Jasper.

48:27.196 --> 48:28.778
Stay cool.

48:28.823 --> 48:29.939
Take care.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.982
<i>Accept his blessing.</i>

48:33.452 --> 48:36.786
<i>Let all the wolves
of your past be</i>

48:36.831 --> 48:38.697
<i>laid to rest.</i>

48:46.215 --> 48:47.456
Tyler...

48:47.925 --> 48:51.043
I am going to give you

48:51.095 --> 48:53.212
all of my wishes

48:53.264 --> 48:54.926
for my birthday.

49:24.420 --> 49:25.661
Thank you.

49:28.340 --> 49:29.626
You're welcome.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.373
Hi, sir. Sorry to bother you.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.378
I'm wondering if
you've seen this young man.

50:10.090 --> 50:12.332
I ain't seen shit, girl.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.257
I... I apologize.

50:16.305 --> 50:19.514
Um... Maybe have you...
Have you heard him?

50:19.558 --> 50:21.595
- Have you heard his voice?
- God-fearing?

50:24.813 --> 50:26.645
- Sometimes.
- Well, good.

50:27.191 --> 50:30.059
You come on in here
and let's talk about Jesus.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.461
When you get off,
go towards the shore.

50:59.098 --> 51:00.805
There's drag marks.

51:00.808 --> 51:03.516
- What happened?
- My ankle hurts.

51:03.519 --> 51:05.476
- Your ankle hurts?
- Yeah.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.012
All right,
we'll fix you right now.

51:07.481 --> 51:08.597
Drink that.

51:08.649 --> 51:09.765
Make you feel better.

51:17.241 --> 51:18.652
All right,
rule number one is what?

51:19.618 --> 51:20.734
- Party.
- Party!

51:20.786 --> 51:22.493
All right! Ha!

51:22.538 --> 51:24.905
Yeah! Yeah!

51:26.792 --> 51:29.705
14, 15, 16,

51:29.753 --> 51:32.587
17, 18, 19...

51:34.091 --> 51:36.424
I cannot feel my...

51:36.468 --> 51:37.504
My hands.

51:37.761 --> 51:41.380
I cannot feel my hands,

51:41.432 --> 51:45.301
- and I cannot feel my ankle.
- You can't feel shit.

51:45.352 --> 51:46.763
You can't feel shit.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.644
Don't step on me now.
Don't step on me.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.555
Oh, excuse me, Tyler...

51:50.608 --> 51:51.849
You can't feel shit.

51:52.735 --> 51:54.818
- What?
- I got to get my log.

52:02.828 --> 52:03.944
Hey.

52:05.456 --> 52:06.697
I'm not strong enough.

52:06.749 --> 52:08.206
Who's strong enough?

52:09.168 --> 52:10.409
Who's strong enough?

52:16.133 --> 52:18.069
Hey, you know what you need?
You need to change your...

52:18.093 --> 52:19.154
You need to change your name.

52:19.178 --> 52:21.966
You need to get a...
An alternate ego.

52:22.389 --> 52:23.630
You know what I'm saying?

52:23.682 --> 52:25.639
Like in
the Wrestling Federation.

52:26.060 --> 52:28.427
Wrestlers got alter egos.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.345
What's your favorite
wrestler's name?

52:30.856 --> 52:31.972
The Salt Water Redneck.

52:32.274 --> 52:34.641
The Salt Water Redneck
ain't born with that name.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.439
You need a name.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.274
What's your name?

52:42.076 --> 52:43.192
Falcon.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.825
Falcon. Falcon.

52:48.457 --> 52:50.119
Ooh, Falcon.

52:50.584 --> 52:52.075
Falcon. That's a good name.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.163
Hold on.

52:53.212 --> 52:54.953
Ooh, I got an idea.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.167
Hold on right there.
Wait right there.

52:57.216 --> 52:58.957
You got to make a uniform.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.716
Falcon uniform!

53:00.761 --> 53:01.877
Hell, yeah!

53:01.929 --> 53:03.295
Falcon.

53:04.306 --> 53:05.342
Hey!

53:05.391 --> 53:07.035
Did I tell you you could have
some of that peanut butter?

53:07.059 --> 53:09.301
It ain't snack time,
it's jack time.

53:09.353 --> 53:10.389
Here we go.

53:12.523 --> 53:13.809
Whoo-hoo!

53:14.942 --> 53:16.308
We need war paint.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.817
Yeah.

53:17.861 --> 53:19.147
I need peanut butter.

53:20.989 --> 53:22.446
You want to be slick.

53:22.491 --> 53:24.153
The Peanut Butter Falcon!

53:24.201 --> 53:25.658
Get it up!

53:25.703 --> 53:27.319
Pick that sucker up!

53:30.541 --> 53:32.123
Push it! Push it! Push!

53:36.922 --> 53:38.458
You got it! You got it!

53:39.299 --> 53:42.633
Peanut Butter Falcon!

53:42.678 --> 53:44.715
You got it!

54:14.168 --> 54:17.036
I'm the Peanut Butter Falcon!

54:42.237 --> 54:43.478
Zak.

54:45.824 --> 54:47.065
Zak!

54:48.285 --> 54:49.492
Zak.

54:49.578 --> 54:50.785
Oh, my God.

54:50.996 --> 54:52.908
Zak, are you okay?

54:53.499 --> 54:55.286
- Oh, my God.
- Hello!

54:57.377 --> 54:58.618
Hey!

55:01.215 --> 55:02.251
Come on, sit up.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.985
You found us.
That's them pheromones.

55:04.009 --> 55:05.591
- Like a bear.
- What is this?

55:05.636 --> 55:07.377
- What's on your face?
- Yeah!

55:07.429 --> 55:09.240
I thought you said
you hadn't seen him.

55:09.264 --> 55:11.802
He's right there. There he is.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.722
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

55:14.770 --> 55:16.039
- Come on. Thank you.
- No, you're good.

55:16.063 --> 55:17.123
You're good right there.
Sit right there.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.183
He's all right.

55:18.232 --> 55:20.315
Okay, I don't know
what's going on, but, uh...

55:20.359 --> 55:22.100
Put that on, Zak.
Here, brother.

55:22.152 --> 55:23.609
I've got it. Thank you.

55:23.654 --> 55:25.316
He could do it.

55:25.364 --> 55:26.841
He could put his own shirt on.
He's 22 years old.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.026
Thank you. I've got it.

55:28.867 --> 55:29.903
We're good now.

55:29.952 --> 55:30.988
Huh.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.368
Here you go, bud.

55:32.412 --> 55:34.074
You ready?
You good to go? You okay?

55:34.122 --> 55:36.034
- Ah, my ankle.
- What? What...

55:36.083 --> 55:37.435
- He's fine.
- What happened to his ankle?

55:37.459 --> 55:39.416
- What's wrong with his ankle?
- Nothing's wrong.

55:39.461 --> 55:40.980
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

55:41.004 --> 55:43.166
- Who are you, even?
- Who are you, even?

55:44.967 --> 55:46.629
You have a young boy
with Down syndrome

55:46.677 --> 55:48.464
in the middle of nowhere.

55:48.512 --> 55:49.781
I'm the one who's been taking
care of him,

55:49.805 --> 55:51.885
because you can't do it
unless you put him in a cage.

55:52.224 --> 55:53.681
Okay, um...

55:54.393 --> 55:56.931
Look, he needs to be
properly taken care of,

55:56.979 --> 55:58.436
and that's my job.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.722
I'm sorry to break up
your little primitive gang,

56:00.774 --> 56:01.835
or whatever's going on...

56:01.859 --> 56:03.475
...but this is not
<i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

56:03.527 --> 56:05.610
You can't... There's rules,
there's regulations.

56:05.654 --> 56:07.987
- He has medication, paperwork.
- Okay. Yeah. All right.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.384
Well, while you've been
doing paperwork,

56:09.408 --> 56:10.510
we've been doing something
called living,

56:10.534 --> 56:12.150
- ain't that right, brother?
- Yeah.

56:13.453 --> 56:14.569
Okay.

56:15.372 --> 56:16.408
Cool.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.495
But we're gonna go,
so, thank you.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.331
No, we're not.
He's fine where he is.

56:22.838 --> 56:24.955
May I please
speak to you in private?

56:25.007 --> 56:27.215
Oh. Oh, like a private party?
Yeah, all right.

56:27.259 --> 56:29.797
- One second, Zak.
- I got water. You want water?

56:29.845 --> 56:31.177
Right now.

56:31.221 --> 56:32.837
"Primitive gang."
Hell, yeah.

56:33.390 --> 56:34.993
I like when you put
your hair up like that.

56:35.017 --> 56:36.258
It's nice.

56:36.310 --> 56:37.426
Water?

56:39.521 --> 56:42.059
Look, I could have you
arrested for kidnapping, okay?

56:42.107 --> 56:43.167
Oh, you're going to
have me arrested?

56:43.191 --> 56:44.227
How... How do you figure?

56:44.276 --> 56:45.336
You can't have me arrested.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.713
He's a runaway.
Can't kidnap a runaway.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.899
Come on, genius.
You said GW, didn't you?

56:48.947 --> 56:50.984
I'm sure I could find
some reason to arrest you.

56:51.033 --> 56:52.833
Hey, let me ask you,
what do you want for him?

56:53.911 --> 56:55.698
I'm not going
to sell him to you.

56:55.746 --> 56:57.487
No, no, what do you
want for his life?

56:57.539 --> 56:58.950
His future?

57:01.543 --> 57:02.645
Why are you... You don't know
anything about him.

57:02.669 --> 57:03.730
You know
about the wrestling?

57:03.754 --> 57:05.231
Yes, of course I know about
the wrestling.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.215
All right, so I know
something about him, don't I?

57:08.425 --> 57:10.132
So, uh, you're a little
late to the party.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.294
This is what's going on.
I made a promise to him

57:12.346 --> 57:13.823
to get him to that
wrestling school in Ayden.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.491
- Oh.
- You understand? I gave him

57:15.515 --> 57:17.285
my word, and I ain't gonna
back down on my word.

57:17.309 --> 57:18.536
Now, you seem like
a nice person.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.163
You care for him and all.
You came all the way out here.

57:20.187 --> 57:21.456
Maybe it's because
you like me. I don't know.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.314
Yeah? And, uh,
I'mma offer you a favor.

57:24.358 --> 57:25.418
You can get on that raft
with us

57:25.442 --> 57:27.002
and you can ride down there
if you want.

57:27.778 --> 57:30.987
No... No, we're not going
to hop on your little raft

57:31.031 --> 57:32.759
- and cruise around the river.
- It's hot. You're confused.

57:32.783 --> 57:35.776
- I'm not asking you.
- Hey, Eleanor!

57:37.621 --> 57:39.362
Oh! Ooh! Oh.

57:40.248 --> 57:41.455
Oh!

57:41.500 --> 57:44.243
I want to see...

57:45.420 --> 57:48.037
Salt Water Redneck.

57:48.090 --> 57:50.707
And I don't want to go home.

58:13.281 --> 58:17.366
So how far is it on, um...
On the raft?

58:19.037 --> 58:20.278
About that far on a map.

58:23.458 --> 58:24.915
Are your fingers to scale?

58:24.960 --> 58:25.996
Yeah.

58:26.044 --> 58:28.582
So how much time is that much?

58:28.630 --> 58:30.667
That's different
than what I put up.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.676
- All right.
- What I did is about a day.

58:33.343 --> 58:34.584
Maybe two days.

58:36.430 --> 58:37.762
- Days? Like...
- Yeah.

58:39.725 --> 58:40.841
Okay.

58:45.897 --> 58:47.013
Are you kidding?

58:48.483 --> 58:50.645
What in the Christ...

58:51.028 --> 58:53.611
Hey, Zak,
why don't you sit down, bud.

58:53.655 --> 58:54.841
You're kind of close
to the edge.

58:54.865 --> 58:56.527
I don't want you to fall in.

58:58.285 --> 59:00.322
Hey, are you hungry?
Have you eaten anything?

59:00.370 --> 59:02.453
I am not really hungry.

59:02.497 --> 59:04.350
Well, maybe you should just
have a bite of something

59:04.374 --> 59:05.410
for your blood sugar.

59:05.459 --> 59:06.602
He don't want
nothing to eat.

59:06.626 --> 59:08.913
You know how you get, buddy.
I have an apple.

59:08.962 --> 59:11.170
- Hey.
- I have some M&M's.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.001
- What?
- Don't do that.

59:13.050 --> 59:14.291
Don't do what?

59:21.183 --> 59:22.910
Hey, I got an idea, why don't
we keep our training going.

59:22.934 --> 59:23.995
Just because we're on a raft

59:24.019 --> 59:25.699
don't mean we gonna
stop training, does it?

59:25.729 --> 59:27.498
All right, so we're gonna do
breathing control exercises.

59:27.522 --> 59:28.666
She's worried about
your blood sugar.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.397
We're gonna breathe.
Take a deep breath in.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.026
Out.

59:34.071 --> 59:35.214
All right, cool,
now come over here

59:35.238 --> 59:36.340
and put your head underwater.

59:36.364 --> 59:37.480
I'm gonna time you.

59:37.824 --> 59:39.343
What? No, no, no.
He can't do that. Zak...

59:39.367 --> 59:41.012
No, he can do that.
He can do that. He can...

59:44.039 --> 59:46.372
There you go. You'd better
stop calling him a retard.

59:46.958 --> 59:49.701
I have never called
anyone a... That word.

59:49.753 --> 59:50.789
Okay. Hold on, listen,

59:50.837 --> 59:52.231
when people are saying
he's a retard, really what

59:52.255 --> 59:53.900
they're saying is he can't
do some shit they can do.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.943
See, you might not be saying
the word "retard", all right,

59:55.967 --> 59:57.111
I'll give you that,
but you damn sure

59:57.135 --> 59:58.342
is making him feel retarded.

59:58.386 --> 59:59.718
That ain't gonna
help his life.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.675
- Hey, there we go.
- Time.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:03.055
- How long is that?
- Long.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.095
Not long enough, Zak.
Do it again.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.600
Okay.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.978
You have got some real nerve
talking to me like that.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.896
Do you even know what I do?

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.528
I've spent the last two years
of my life

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:21.191
volunteering to hold people's
hands as they pass away.

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:23.610
I talk to them, I feed them,
I wipe their asses,

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.745
I change their clothes,
I put them to bed.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.285
And I'm the last person
they see.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.909
Don't act like you know
jack shit about me.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:31.997
All right.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.898
Yeah, maybe he should not
be in a retirement home,

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.504
but I didn't choose that
for him.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:36.585
But that's what happened,

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.169
and now I am doing
the best I can.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.802
Oh! Oh!

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:43.884
- Hey! Oh, shit!
- Oh!

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.798
God! Zak! Okay.

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:47.387
Yeah! Lunch!

01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:49.722
Zak, did you just
catch that with your hands?

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.854
How'd you do that?

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.264
You're a wild man.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.933
Oh, my God.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.285
<i>We got three options
for lunch today.</i>

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:28.925
We can boil water
from the sound,

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:30.468
make a little chowder.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.886
- Huh?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:33.725
- Plain fish?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.356
- Fish with peanut butter?
- Fish with peanut butter.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:37.437
Hey!

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.921
You got to give him
what he wants then.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.186
Here, go ahead. Load up.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:42.772
Oh,
just right on there.

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.464
- There you go.
- That's... Yeah.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.575
You want a big piece
or small piece?

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.986
That's good. That's great.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.599
If you fold it,
you can make a little taco.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:52.331
- Okay, that's nice.
- Yeah.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.741
That's a good bite.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.208
That's good, huh?

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:00.999
Five stars.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:02.876
You hear that?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.255
Bang.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:08.718
Boom!

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.053
What is that?

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:15.479
That is our special handshake.

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:16.604
- Yeah.
- That...

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:19.267
- That is our special thing.
- Yeah.

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.355
Yeah.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.756
I want to have
a special handshake.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.066
It's only for special shit.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:25.401
Like what kind of
special shit?

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:27.612
I don't know. Go ahead.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.368
No, you tell her.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.449
- You brought it up.
- Um...

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:33.740
Talk about the boat.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:34.953
Oh, uh...

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.618
We did... Hit by the boat.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.663
- Almost.
- You... You got hit by a boat?

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.376
- Almost.
- What happened?

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.165
We almost got run over
by a shrimp boat.

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:45.130
- What?
- Yeah.

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:48.880
- And we did the...
- Shotgun.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:51.265
Shotgun. Buckshot.
He fired a shotgun.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.595
And we got shot at, remember?

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:54.135
Oh, yeah, I did remember.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.165
Eleanor, this is so easy.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.499
- Easy.
- Uh...

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.130
Hold on

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:25.086
- and let go.
- Let go. That's it.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.584
- Let go.
- Let go.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:27.922
Ready? Three...

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.054
- No, no, no, don't rush me.
- ...two, one.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.384
Get it! Get it! Get it!

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.646
Come here!

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:41.690
Zak.

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:03.295
I love my family,

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:07.004
and I hope that we will
share it forever,

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:09.465
for the rest of our life.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.338
Yes!

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.812
If you were the prince
in a royal family,

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.317
what would your name be?

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.316
Uh, Zak Prince.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.607
That's really good.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:46.519
Hold up, Tyler.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.150
Hey, hey!

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:49.588
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Get on your knees.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.979
Get on your knees.
Over there. Right here.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.147
Okay.

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:02.785
That's $12,000 worth of gear
you burnt up.

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.075
That's my season.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.480
What's to stop other people
from messing with us

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:07.540
now that you have?

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:09.330
I won't ever mention,
no harm done.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:10.942
Even so,
I got to make it right.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.549
Not just for me,
but for all of us.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:13.630
For our livelihood.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:14.780
You ain't
gonna shoot me, Duncan.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.032
I'm gonna get you your money,
I promise you. I promise you.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.172
Shut the hell up, man.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.056
Shut up. Right hand
or left hand, Tyler?

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.704
I'm gonna make it right,
I'm gonna get you your money.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.164
No, Tyler. Right hand or left
hand? I'm giving you a choice.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:25.225
- You better hurry up.
- Screw this. Right hand.

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:26.793
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:28.182
Whoa!

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:30.563
Zak.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.065
Stay there.

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:39.322
You could pull the trigger.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.699
Can you aim that thing?

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:44.247
It's a buckshot.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.092
Get back in your boat,
and you're gonna leave.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:47.688
We ain't never gonna
see each other again.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:48.828
Or he's gonna shoot you.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:53.253
You're not the only one
that's hard up around here.

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:56.093
We need that money.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:08.390
Tyler, what was that?

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.600
Trouble.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:12.143
Problems.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:22.869
You upset with me?

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:39.636
It ain't gonna happen no more.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:51.807
What's that "T" on your wrist?

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.065
It's a "J".

01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:57.650
What's the "J" on your wrist?

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:00.983
Um...

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.821
It was for my husband.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.161
You're married?

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.042
No, I'm not married anymore.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.203
You divorced?

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.291
No.

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:16.423
I'm a widow.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.473
I'm sorry.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:25.758
It's okay.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:32.354
Don't be sorry.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.402
We're really similar.

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:44.029
And not at all too.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.529
I'm having
some breakfast.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.198
Peanut butter.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.661
You're having
some breakfast?

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:51.951
Yeah.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.620
Hi, Glen.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.336
Yeah. Yes, I have him. I...

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.760
He is sitting
right next to me.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.841
No, he's... He's fine.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.846
Uh, he was alone.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:07.008
Yeah.

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:09.760
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.434
No, there's no need
to send anybody.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:14.939
I've got it.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.863
What? No. Glen,
that's not... I'm...

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:26.785
No. Cherry Hill is a place
where they send drug addicts

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.321
and prostitutes, not Zak.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.703
Yes, I know, I did label him
a flight risk,

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.870
but I just think that he might
be better suited in an...

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.707
I... I understand
what you're...

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:42.801
Okay.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.881
Boo-yeah!
- Okay, yeah, no, I get it.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:49.388
Okay, schedule his processing
for tomorrow afternoon then.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:54.892
Oh, you mighty thirsty.
Here you go.

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:59.442
Can I get you
anything else, hon?

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:02.946
No, I'm...

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:07.743
Actually, do you know
who the Salt Water Redneck is?

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.988
Oh, everybody around here
knows Salt Water.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.872
He used to be a celebrity.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.539
Do you know where he lives?

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.209
- Maybe it's...
- Let me see.

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:24.405
Maybe it's not
the right place.

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:26.386
This is the right place,
5-3-0.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:30.016
Yeah, this is it.

01:10:44.532 --> 01:10:45.943
Shit!

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:47.817
Jesus Christ.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:51.863
Who are you?

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.207
You're Salt Water Redneck?

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.084
What is this?

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.840
I'm sorry,
is this the wrestling school?

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:05.876
Who's asking?

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:07.587
My name's Tyler.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.426
I ain't selling nothing
to you.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:11.932
You see that boy back there?

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:16.971
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so, we done, uh...

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:19.724
We done some hard trailing
to get to you.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:21.854
It's a big deal
seeing you here.

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:23.144
You mind waving to him?

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:27.687
He's got a lot riding on you.
You mind just waving to him?

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:30.279
How you doing?

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:31.903
Hey.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.874
You don't teach no
wrestling school here no more?

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.157
I closed that
about 10 years ago.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:42.914
Did you?

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.548
So I promised him
he would do this one thing.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.466
You know,
this wrestling thing.

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.886
And he told me about
this school here in Ayden.

01:11:56.938 --> 01:12:00.602
And we... We'd had
a big journey to get here.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:01.891
And, uh...

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.018
Now I got to break
his heart, you know?

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:06.937
And I don't really know
what to say to him.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:13.326
But that ain't your shit,
you know?

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.051
I don't mean to bring shit
to your doorstep

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.322
or nothing like that.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:20.168
What's your name?

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.831
- It's Clint.
- Clint.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.082
It's nice to meet you.

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:28.709
So...

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.461
He used to be a fan?

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:33.130
Oh, man, shit,
you're his hero.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.160
He believes in you.
That's a hard thing to do,

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.641
believe in something,
you know?

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.305
- Hey, Zak.
- Yeah.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.438
This is Clint.

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:44.753
- Hey, Clinton.
- Hey, come up here.

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:46.177
You mind if he comes
and says, "Hi"?

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:48.312
That'd be all right.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.050
Hey, pal, Salt Water
don't live here no more.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:53.192
But, uh, Clint's just
a regular guy like me or you.

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:54.701
He wanted to shake your hand.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:56.529
Hey.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.450
- How are you doing?
- Good.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:02.913
Nice to meet you.

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.587
Thanks.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.668
All right, thanks, partner.
Come on, bub.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.675
Nice to meet you, Clint.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.397
Hey, Tyler.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.142
What?

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.235
I bet

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:32.113
we could find him by...
By the raft.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:38.241
Maybe he is hiding
by the swamp.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.156
He's not real, bud.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.449
Salt Water don't exist.

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:46.377
I saw the videotape,

01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:50.340
and he is real.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:51.875
He's not real, Zak.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.511
I just saw, like,
a thousand movies of him.

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:57.673
Zak, I don't think
we're gonna find him.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.808
I think it's time
for us to go back now.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.765
I don't wanna go back.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:05.601
Tyler told me this,

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:08.313
and he lied to me,
and he promised me.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:10.731
And I don't wanna go back.

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.655
I wanna stay here.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.110
We can't, Zak.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.151
We have lives to go back to.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:20.947
Eleanor, I am strong enough.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.864
And I could catch
a fish for you.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.579
And I'm gonna be a hero.

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:27.915
And I could take care of you.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.163
We could be a family.

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:02.704
Holy shit.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.410
Salt Water Redneck.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.994
- It's you.
- Hey.

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:07.375
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.501
I'm doing good.

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:09.787
I am so happy to see you.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.000
I'm happy to see you.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:12.418
For me...

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:16.210
I saw
so many videos about you.

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:18.549
Yeah? You want to learn
some wrestling?

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.304
Oh, hell, yeah.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.806
And I feel great.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.513
Um, can I, uh...

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:26.015
Uh, can I join you
for the ride?

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:28.055
- Of course. Get in.
- And... And...

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:30.224
- And can I bring my family?
- Sure.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.607
I told you. I told you.
I told you.

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:35.691
He's real.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:37.898
Come on. Join us.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.282
Have some fun.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.488
Damn.

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:49.247
The first thing you do is,

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:50.355
you're gonna
kind ofjust, like,

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.042
you're gonna feel out,
you know, how big the ring is.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:55.628
You just go, you know,
kind of check out, you know,

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.000
what your space is,

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.411
where you're gonna be
moving around.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.429
All right, now,
one of the fundamentals

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:03.557
is when you go to
hit a guy with an elbow.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:04.911
You got to hit a guy
with an elbow,

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:06.927
but also do a foot stomp.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.373
Yeah, but kind of
pop your head too.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.184
Just gives it more energy.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.939
Yeah. Okay, that's good.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:15.102
Um, was there anything
special in the video

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:16.520
that you want me to teach you?

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:20.191
Uh, will you please
show me the Atomic Throw?

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:21.358
Ah.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.697
Yeah, the Atomic Throw.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.612
Honestly, Zak,
we just made that up.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:27.246
You know,
it was smoke and mirrors.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:28.827
It was just
a camera on my face.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:29.936
And then it looked like I was

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.417
holding the guy up
over my head,

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.752
and then we'd cut to a guy

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:34.208
getting thrown
out of the ring.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.122
It's not possible to do.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:38.041
But I can show you
a lot of other cool stuff.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.756
What do you think, Sam?

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:41.511
Might try a collar
and elbow lockup.

01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:42.591
There you go, a lockup.

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:44.889
All right, now, what you do,

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.596
you come in and boom,
right there, boom.

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:49.102
You know, boom, boom.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.762
But when you come in to do it,

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:53.649
you got to really, really,
really slam...

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:54.933
Yeah.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:57.227
Yeah. Growl all you want. See?

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.315
Then we kind of...

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:00.175
Now we can move around
a little bit, like this.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:01.676
You don't know
what I'm going to do...

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.032
What are you gonna do?

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.073
What do you mean?

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.363
I mean, what are you
going to do

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:11.537
after all this is over?

01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:15.621
Well, I'm gonna settle
my debts with Duncan.

01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:19.591
I'mma go up to
Jupiter, Florida.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:23.323
Town called Jupiter up there

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:24.883
is a small little
fishing town.

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.074
It's on the Indian River,
and it opens up

01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:29.058
to this big estuary.

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.475
It's the biggest estuary
in America.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.059
I'm gonna get a boat
and I'm gonna

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.308
just live a good life.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.148
Run charters and take people
sport fishing.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:41.647
Hmm.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.149
You ever been to Florida?

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:45.908
- Mmm-mmm.
- No?

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:48.779
You want to go?

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:52.161
- To Florida?
- Yeah.

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:02.362
You know,
certain things,

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:03.502
it takes years to learn.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:06.012
Like how to fall
without hurting yourself.

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:07.617
But then that stuff
just comes with time.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:08.757
As long as you don't do...

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.016
It takes so much time.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.096
Yeah, it takes time,

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.745
but as long as you don't
do the same move

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:14.808
in the same bout,
you're good to go.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:15.893
You look real.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.399
Oh, yeah, and I'm totally
ready to do this.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:20.519
You want to fight for real?

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.939
- Yeah. For-real match.
- For real?

01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:26.449
- Yeah.
- You want to do a match?

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:28.985
Oh. Oh, yeah,
seriously. Yeah.

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:30.745
- I love it.
- Good.

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:33.156
- That's great.
- I don't think he's ready.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.325
Oh, lookit,

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.368
he can't just be out here
practicing all the time.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.878
He did great today.
We can set that up.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:42.883
I mean, there's a card
in Jacob's backyard tomorrow.

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:44.509
I mean, you're fighting
on that card.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:45.760
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:47.841
- Y'all two can fight.
- Hey!

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.176
That's outstanding.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.466
A real match.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:51.849
You want
to fight Samson?

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.601
- Hell, yeah.
- Good.

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:55.387
Yes, I do. Tomorrow.

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:56.975
Oh, man!

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.936
Yeah, take on Sam.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:02.853
Yo, um, please, don't mess
with the Peanut Butter Falcon.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.567
Peanut Butter Falcon
in the house.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:07.073
I see a problem here.
Seems a bit soon.

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:08.608
- He's great.
- Really?

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:10.448
- Yeah!
- I'm going to be there.

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:12.515
He's going to take care
of him. It'll be like dancing.

01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:15.031
- Oh, yeah.
- Sam?

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.791
Really? Yeah.

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:18.827
Oh, come on, man.
He's in, he's in.

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:20.495
He's grumpy. He's in.

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:22.539
Just let him lead, huh?

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.798
All right, yeah.

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:17.769
I need you to put

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.021
somebody else on the card
to fight Samson.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.681
Yeah, look over there.

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:23.775
Looks kind of lean, wiry,
like a swimmer's physique.

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:26.360
No, no, not him.
The little guy.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:49.863
Had to grease your wheels
a little bit,

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:51.656
but, Zak, you're good, buddy.
You're fighting.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.592
You want to fight?
They'll take girls.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.799
Okay. All right.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:56.887
Yeah.

01:20:57.895 --> 01:20:59.761
Yeah, Tyler's here.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.688
At this wrestling thing
in Ayden.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.573
Zak! One thing you got
to remember, buddy.

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:17.953
Huge part of the game
is smack talk.

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:19.990
As soon as you set foot
in that ring,

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:23.206
I want you to say
the meanest, evilest thing

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:25.119
that comes into your head,
Zak, okay?

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:28.169
You got to go in aggressive.
He is gonna hit you.

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.083
He's gonna hit you,
but you come back harder!

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:32.001
Harder, Zak, all right?

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.717
Oh, one last thing, okay?

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:36.222
It may not even happen.

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:38.849
If you start bleeding, though,
take it to your advantage.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.455
All right? Rub it
on your face a little bit.

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:42.892
Get it on your hands.
He hates that.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.431
He believes
in vampires and shit.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:45.940
All right, I think that's it.

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.810
It's a Zak attack time.
How are you feeling?

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:51.149
You ready? Rah!

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:53.190
Oh, you're up. Yeah!

01:21:53.659 --> 01:21:55.446
Oh, I wish I was
in there with you.

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.451
- Tyler.
- What?

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:03.700
I'm scared.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.709
No, don't do that right now.
Hey, hey!

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:06.998
Don't do that right now.

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:09.585
I know you got this, Zak.
You got this.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.273
I know you can do this.
Say, "I got this."

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:12.667
You've been out here.
You got this.

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:13.926
Say, "I got this."

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.462
- I got this.
- No, not...

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:16.721
like you're asking a question.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.222
Like you mean it.
Mean it. Mean it.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.678
I mean, in your heart.
You know it.

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:20.762
Say, "I got this."

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:22.097
- I got this.
- I got this.

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.682
- I got this.
- Mean it.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:25.141
Make me believe it.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:26.723
I got this.

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:30.859
I got this!

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:32.361
- Do it again.
- I got this!

01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:34.568
- Say it!
- I got this!

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.278
It's you. There he is.

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:37.658
Peanut Butter Falcon. Really?

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:39.695
You're gonna win.
You just got to show up.

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:42.534
Take your shirt off.
We got to find some cardboard.

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:43.994
Wait, wait.
Come here, come here.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.408
Get this box. Get this box.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:46.622
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:48.335
can you feel it?

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.621
Yeah!

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.539
I said, can you feel it?

01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:52.833
Yeah!

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.501
Can you feel the heat?

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:55.589
Yeah!

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.253
I understand why you
took me out here,

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.575
but there ain't no reason
to be scared.

01:22:58.599 --> 01:22:59.701
We're talking about
two different matches.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.119
You're talking about
a hard-core match

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.495
which was what
you just sat through,

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:05.011
and then what Zak's gonna be
doing, which ain't gonna

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:06.429
- be the same match.
- No.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.959
He's gonna do a couple moves,
he's going to lay down,

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.169
it's going to be simple,
and that's gonna be that.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:10.378
Zak's gonna win
and we go home.

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:11.734
Tyler, they don't care
about him.

01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:14.361
- I care about him.
- I know. We care about him.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:15.522
They don't.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.921
Well, that was
going to be the case,

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:19.487
but then,
at the very last moment,

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:21.573
an old friend stopped by.

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:23.158
- Who?
- Who was it?

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:26.325
The Salt Water Redneck

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:29.202
The Salt Water Redneck
stopped by.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:32.713
He brought with him tonight
a protégé.

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:38.629
Okay.

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:40.422
Okay?

01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:41.510
Yeah.

01:23:57.908 --> 01:23:59.344
- You want popcorn?
- Tyler... Oh, my God.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.701
- Tyler, what the...
- I'll get you popcorn.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:02.781
Are you kidding me?

01:24:02.829 --> 01:24:03.890
- You're good.
- Oh, my God.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.325
Nobody's going to die today.

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:06.660
I'll be right back.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.200
May I present to you...

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:19.837
The Peanut Butter Falcon!

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.429
Let's go, let's go!

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:31.306
Hey! Whoo!

01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:34.226
He's wearing a freaking
cardboard box.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.738
Falcon time!

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:48.202
Here we go, here we go.
Fly around, baby!

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.037
Fly around, baby!

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.951
Whoo!

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:56.247
The Falcon!

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.791
Falcon!

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.879
- Whoo!
- All right, Zak.

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:18.065
Peanut Butter Falcon!

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.354
Peanut Butter Falcon!

01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:42.634
Who's ready
for some wrestling?

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:48.053
Peanut Butter Falcon!

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:53.346
Whoo!

01:25:57.402 --> 01:25:58.859
Come on, Zak!

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.981
Zak, say something.

01:26:03.033 --> 01:26:05.320
What do you
think about that, huh?

01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:09.579
I've been doing this
for 38 years, and guess what?

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:11.910
This isn't
Make-A-Wish Foundation

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:14.120
Kick out, Zak.
Kick out that leg!

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:17.962
Legs! Kick out!

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:21.128
There you go, there you go.
Get up, get up! Recover.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.797
Oh, son, you messed up.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:25.629
You want to play some more?

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:29.553
Get up, Zak. Get up.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.259
Samson.

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:33.390
The Peanut Butter Falcon?

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.270
Are you ser...
How about Tweety Bird?

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:36.897
That's more like it.
Tweety Bird.

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:38.524
Get up.

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:40.230
- Get up, bud. Fight.
- Come on, Zak.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:42.065
You want to
play some more?

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:43.400
You know,
I've had enough of you.

01:26:46.576 --> 01:26:48.659
Samson! We had an agreement!

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:51.037
Don't come to me
and expect favors.

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:53.414
- Bullshit.
- Get up. Get up, Zak.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.826
What else do you want?
You stupid little punk.

01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:58.745
You're going down.

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:02.840
Retard, get up, man.

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:06.298
Get your stinking ass
out of the ring, man.

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:25.988
Oh, my God.

01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:29.950
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:32.078
Look at me.
Hey, hey, look at me.

01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:33.909
Let me know,
you want to do this anymore?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.161
Then get up now.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:38.326
Lighten up, Sam.
You're a piece of shit.

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:41.624
Say something, Zak.

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:42.900
Come on, Zak! Come on, Zak!

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:45.007
Come on, Zak!

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:50.884
- Excuse me, Samson.
- What?

01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:54.426
You are not invited
to my birthday party!

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.310
Go, Zak. Go, Zak. Run, run!

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.311
- Yeah...
- Go underneath! Up! Up!

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:49.457
- Let's just start from there.
- Yeah.

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:52.718
Boom. Boom. Boom.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:57.844
You wanna hug?

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:00.969
A little tap of a hug
or just a straight hug?

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:02.887
- Straight hug.
- Straight hug.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.299
Zak. Zak.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:35.545
