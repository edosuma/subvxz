00:00.881 --> 00:02.348
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.383 --> 00:04.224
I got called to a crime scene
outside the city.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.567
<i>I saw Etta</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

00:05.602 --> 00:07.670
<i>She recruited me</i>
<i>in the resistance,</i>

00:07.705 --> 00:09.785
taught me how to block them
from reading my thoughts.

00:09.883 --> 00:11.217
Who is the Dove?

00:11.251 --> 00:13.820
<i>I don't know!</i>
<i>Nobody does!</i>

00:14.349 --> 00:15.884
How far have you come
with the tapes?

00:15.919 --> 00:17.720
We have the rocks
from the mine in Pennsylvania,

00:17.754 --> 00:21.022
the magnet, beacons,
and scrolls of physics.

00:21.057 --> 00:23.624
They are part of a device
that we must build.

00:23.658 --> 00:25.226
If we can send the boy
into the future,

00:25.261 --> 00:26.491
when they study him,

00:26.526 --> 00:27.884
they will realize
all that he is,

00:27.918 --> 00:29.452
and they will never go
down that path.

00:29.486 --> 00:31.354
And the Observers
will never invade.

00:31.388 --> 00:33.824
The plan
is gonna reset time.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.994
It's how we're gonna see
Etta again.

00:36.028 --> 00:38.095
There is one thing
I haven't told the others.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.999
He showed me
that for the plan to work,

00:41.033 --> 00:43.602
I would have
to sacrifice myself.

00:43.637 --> 00:45.571
Michael, Michael!

00:45.605 --> 00:48.274
- Where's Michael?
-  He just walked off the train.

00:48.308 --> 00:50.042
Hello.

00:53.180 --> 00:54.848
Okay, call me back
when you have something.

00:54.882 --> 00:56.216
No answer.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.084
Anil put the word out
to his contacts,

00:58.118 --> 00:59.586
but so far, nobody's
seen or heard anything

00:59.620 --> 01:00.587
about a child Observer.

01:00.621 --> 01:02.389
I do not understand.

01:02.423 --> 01:04.456
I can track the convoy
that's transporting the boy

01:04.492 --> 01:05.525
to "J" Street,
and then they

01:05.559 --> 01:07.060
just fall right off
the grid.

01:07.094 --> 01:09.129
I mean, I can't even
track them on satellites.

01:09.163 --> 01:10.130
Keep trying.

01:10.164 --> 01:11.431
Where the devil is Donald?

01:11.465 --> 01:13.200
Why did we agree
to let him contact us?

01:13.234 --> 01:14.601
'Cause we didn't know
we were gonna lose Michael.

01:14.635 --> 01:16.236
Well, what if he knows
how to communicate

01:16.270 --> 01:18.004
with the boy or has
a way of finding him?

01:18.038 --> 01:20.106
Well, when he gets back
with the tech, we'll find out.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.641
Well, we need to find him
before Windmark

01:21.675 --> 01:23.743
figures out that he's
the key to the plan.

01:23.778 --> 01:25.879
Call him again.

01:33.822 --> 01:35.223
Lieutenant.

01:35.257 --> 01:36.591
I'm sorry, I'm running late
for a meeting.

01:36.625 --> 01:38.359
So am I.

01:38.393 --> 01:41.163
A high-value detainee was taken
into custody last night.

01:41.197 --> 01:42.431
I need to know
where he's being held.

01:42.465 --> 01:43.565
I'm under strict orders

01:43.600 --> 01:45.067
not to disclose
that information.

01:45.101 --> 01:46.168
<i>I understand.</i>

01:46.202 --> 01:47.436
Word came down
that my division

01:47.471 --> 01:49.605
is to supply
reinforced security.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.741
I wasn't informed of that.

01:51.775 --> 01:54.211
Well, I'm informing you now.

01:54.245 --> 01:56.280
There's supposed to be
a measure of cooperation

01:56.314 --> 01:57.981
between our departments,
Lieutenant,

01:58.016 --> 01:59.817
or have you forgotten that?

01:59.851 --> 02:01.252
Agent, there's a change
in protocol

02:01.286 --> 02:03.921
after the security breaches
from within.

02:06.392 --> 02:08.193
Lieutenant...

02:08.227 --> 02:11.530
are you suggesting
that I might be the Dove?

02:15.836 --> 02:18.971
I'm more of a raven,
don't you think?

02:20.407 --> 02:23.242
Yeah. Right.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.045
<i>Detention Camp 17,</i>

02:26.080 --> 02:28.481

02:28.516 --> 02:32.185

02:32.219 --> 02:35.155
Who is the detainee,
anyway?

02:35.190 --> 02:37.457
Hell if I know.

Anomaly XB-6783746.

03:27.844 --> 03:32.014
It is in your interest
to communicate with me.

03:41.258 --> 03:44.326
The people
you were with,

03:44.361 --> 03:47.897
what did they want
with you?

03:53.369 --> 03:56.805
You are of significance
to them.

03:59.008 --> 04:02.610
What is your purpose?

04:13.555 --> 04:16.490
Tell me about September...

04:16.524 --> 04:19.959
the one who hid you.

04:19.995 --> 04:25.400
Why did he hide you?

04:25.434 --> 04:28.474
To what end?

04:59.807 --> 05:03.276
The fugitives have a plan.

05:03.311 --> 05:07.281
Tell me about the plan.

05:09.184 --> 05:13.354
<i>How does it involve you?</i>

Did you find him?

06:31.663 --> 06:33.364
Yes, but the news
isn't good.

06:33.398 --> 06:34.732
They're holding him

06:34.766 --> 06:36.098
at a detention facility
on Liberty Island.

06:36.099 --> 06:37.733
I'm uploading
the schematic to you now.

06:37.767 --> 06:40.771
Let me see.

06:43.545 --> 06:44.878
Okay, I got it.

06:44.913 --> 06:46.113
It looks like a fortress.

06:46.147 --> 06:47.948
<i>It is.</i>

06:47.982 --> 06:49.516
<i>The towers are manned</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

06:49.551 --> 06:51.352
And inside the complex,
you're dealing with

06:51.386 --> 06:53.788
at least five layers
of security.

06:53.822 --> 06:54.889
Can you get us in?

06:54.923 --> 06:57.892
<i>I don't have the clearance.</i>

06:57.927 --> 06:59.561
Where exactly
are they keeping him?

06:59.595 --> 07:02.597
The east wing...

07:02.632 --> 07:04.533
in what they call their
neurological research unit.

07:04.567 --> 07:07.103
They're going to experiment
on him.

07:07.137 --> 07:09.407
<i>Most likely, yes.</i>

07:09.441 --> 07:11.945
<i>Or worse.</i>

07:11.980 --> 07:14.316
No building is impenetrable.
How do we get in?

07:14.350 --> 07:17.586
I could get you a boat.

07:19.657 --> 07:21.625
But there are sensors
located around the perimeter

07:21.660 --> 07:23.060
monitoring all movement.

07:23.095 --> 07:24.962
Well, what if I could hack
into the system

07:24.997 --> 07:26.431
and disable them remotely?

07:26.465 --> 07:28.466
They have multiple
redundant alarm systems.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.034
<i>If one is tampered with,</i>

07:30.069 --> 07:33.571
<i>the others automatically</i>
<i>lock the place down.</i>

07:33.606 --> 07:35.106
We need an end run.

07:35.141 --> 07:37.576
We need to bypass
security altogether.

07:37.610 --> 07:40.045
How?

07:41.248 --> 07:43.016
The other side?

07:43.050 --> 07:45.384
The other side of what?

07:46.987 --> 07:50.356
You mean
the alternate universe?

07:50.390 --> 07:53.225
What if the island
is accessible from over there?

07:53.259 --> 07:55.027
<i>If I can find</i>
<i>the right location,</i>

07:55.061 --> 07:56.229
then I can cross over,

07:56.263 --> 07:57.663
grab Michael
from underneath them,

07:57.698 --> 08:01.667
and then bring him back
with me.

08:01.701 --> 08:03.469
But Walter said
that the Cortexiphan

08:03.503 --> 08:04.670
burned out of your system.

08:04.705 --> 08:06.071
<i>Without that,</i>
<i>you no longer</i>

08:06.106 --> 08:08.507
<i>have the ability</i>
<i>to cross over.</i>

08:11.211 --> 08:15.015
Maybe there's a way
I can get it back.

08:20.889 --> 08:23.190
Perhaps she can.

08:28.830 --> 08:31.865
How do we even know if
the Cortexiphan is still good?

08:31.899 --> 08:34.768
It has a shelf life
of 127 years.

08:34.802 --> 08:36.169
<i>Belly made sure of it.</i>

08:36.203 --> 08:37.703
<i>But, Walter, how do we know</i>

08:37.738 --> 08:39.037
<i>that this is gonna work?</i>

08:39.071 --> 08:40.738
<i>When you ran the trials,</i>
<i>you gave Olivia</i>

08:40.772 --> 08:43.501
controlled doses
over an extended period.

08:43.535 --> 08:45.262
That's true,
but Olivia's treatment

08:45.297 --> 08:46.795
created a unique network

08:46.830 --> 08:48.863
of neural pathways
in the brain.

08:48.898 --> 08:51.799
<i>They may have atrophied</i>
<i>through disuse,</i>

08:51.834 --> 08:54.335
but a sudden jolt
of Cortexiphan

08:54.369 --> 08:56.670
could reactivate them,
temporarily at least.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.373
"Temporarily"?
How long would I have?

08:59.408 --> 09:00.408
I-I don't know.

09:00.442 --> 09:01.909
I'll have to calibrate that

09:01.943 --> 09:03.663
once I've determined
just how massive a dose

09:03.678 --> 09:05.179
I can safely give you.

09:05.213 --> 09:07.582
How can a massive dose
possibly be safe, Walter?

09:07.616 --> 09:08.817
The side effects
of Cortexiphan

09:08.851 --> 09:10.118
have always
been unpredictable.

09:10.152 --> 09:11.285
Can you honestly tell me
that you know

09:11.320 --> 09:12.486
exactly how
she'd react?

09:12.520 --> 09:13.819
I don't know.
I think.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.453
<i>Could it give her seizures?</i>

09:15.487 --> 09:16.988
<i>Possibly.</i>
Could it stop her heart?

09:17.022 --> 09:18.356
<i>There's a chance</i>
<i>of that, yes.</i>

09:18.390 --> 09:19.910
Could it cause her
to phase in and out,

09:19.925 --> 09:21.559
disappear entirely,
burst into flames?

09:21.593 --> 09:22.994
Those are the risks, yes.

09:23.028 --> 09:24.562
I'll do all I can
to mitigate it,

09:24.596 --> 09:26.731
<i>but I cannot eliminate them</i>
<i>altogether.</i>

09:26.765 --> 09:27.865
No, it's too dangerous.

09:27.899 --> 09:30.868
Peter.

09:30.902 --> 09:33.770
What other choice
do we have?

09:33.804 --> 09:37.540
We can't let anything
happen to him.

09:37.574 --> 09:40.743
Etta died so that
we could finish the plan.

09:40.778 --> 09:44.547
"Both feet in."
That's what we said.

09:45.515 --> 09:49.251
And what if I lose you too?

09:52.254 --> 09:54.322
What then?

09:58.894 --> 10:01.863
I can do this.

10:01.897 --> 10:05.166
Without him...

10:05.200 --> 10:07.635
We lose everything.

10:17.913 --> 10:19.847
All right, let's say
that you could cross over.

10:19.882 --> 10:21.783
What then?

10:21.817 --> 10:23.918
We have no idea
what you'd find over there.

10:23.953 --> 10:25.219
We know their
Department of Defense

10:25.254 --> 10:26.187
was on Liberty Island.

10:26.221 --> 10:27.889
It <i>was</i> on Liberty Island.

10:27.923 --> 10:29.356
We closed that bridge
24 years ago.

10:29.391 --> 10:30.925
For all we know,

10:30.959 --> 10:32.893
the Observers could have
invaded over there as well.

10:32.927 --> 10:36.363
We have no way of knowing
what happened.

10:37.732 --> 10:40.701
Not necessarily.

10:40.735 --> 10:43.703
The Universe Window.

10:45.907 --> 10:47.974
<i>Why don't we</i>
<i>just have a look?</i>

10:48.008 --> 10:50.176
Of course.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.945
That's brilliant, Asgard.

10:52.979 --> 10:54.247
Ha!

10:54.281 --> 10:56.382
Peter, help us
with the window.

11:03.323 --> 11:05.683
The paralytic will render him
motionless from the neck down,

11:05.693 --> 11:07.694
assuring there will be
no interference

11:07.728 --> 11:10.864
with our diagnostics.

11:47.301 --> 11:51.003
Alert me
when you have the results.

12:18.065 --> 12:19.365
Whoa, whoa.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.634
<i>We got a Loyalist.</i>

12:33.681 --> 12:36.449
All right, she's gone.

12:39.289 --> 12:42.262
You ready for the window?
Yes.

12:54.153 --> 12:56.821
Hey, Walter?
Make sure that you--

12:56.856 --> 12:58.289
Aah!

12:58.324 --> 13:00.458
<i>Fudge sticks.</i>
Plug the other one in first.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.002
There.

13:11.036 --> 13:14.375
Peter. Olivia.

13:14.409 --> 13:16.110
The moment of truth.

13:34.428 --> 13:37.697
<i>It's working.</i>

13:39.166 --> 13:42.067
Call Anil--
we're gonna need a safe house

13:42.101 --> 13:43.568
and medical equipment.

13:43.603 --> 13:45.571
Isn't she beautiful?

14:30.143 --> 14:32.878
Hello?

14:34.313 --> 14:36.849
Walter?

16:25.895 --> 16:28.649
It's this way.

16:32.267 --> 16:33.863
This is Tobin.
He's our field surgeon.

16:33.897 --> 16:35.588
<i>He'll assist you</i>
<i>in whatever way he can.</i>

16:35.623 --> 16:36.718
Dr. Bishop.

16:36.752 --> 16:39.073
I got the items
you requested.

16:39.107 --> 16:41.232
I asked for a defibrillator.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.157
I wasn't able
to secure one in time.

16:43.192 --> 16:45.783
<i>In case of cardiac arrest,</i>
<i>I do have this--</i>

16:45.818 --> 16:47.474
adrenaline.

16:47.509 --> 16:48.503
<i>It's riskier.</i>

16:48.537 --> 16:50.729
But it will have to suffice.

16:50.763 --> 16:54.146
We must get started.

17:18.186 --> 17:20.941
For the Cortexiphan
to take effect quickly,

17:20.974 --> 17:24.596
<i>it has to be injected</i>
<i>directly into the brain stem</i>

17:24.630 --> 17:27.746
in the back of your neck.

17:30.936 --> 17:32.031
I'm okay.

17:32.065 --> 17:34.985
Ready for the first dose?

17:35.020 --> 17:36.778
Okay.

17:36.812 --> 17:40.133
Okay.
One, two...

17:46.718 --> 17:48.609
Her heart rate
is elevated, Walter--

17:48.644 --> 17:51.498
160 bpm and rising.

17:52.824 --> 17:54.486
Liv?

17:54.520 --> 17:57.474
I'm okay.
Let's keep going.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.717
Take a deep breath.

18:02.751 --> 18:05.043
And exhale.

18:10.686 --> 18:12.978
Heart rate is 180 bpm,
Walter.

18:13.012 --> 18:15.004
Olivia?

18:15.038 --> 18:17.363
Hey.
Liv, honey, look at me.

18:17.397 --> 18:21.547
Olivia? Honey, look at me.

18:22.673 --> 18:24.630
Peter.

18:24.665 --> 18:27.390
Olivia.

18:27.424 --> 18:30.511
Walter, she can't see me.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.869
She's at 200 bpm.
You have to stop this.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.466
I have to elevate
her heart rate.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.724
You don't know
what you're talking about.

18:34.758 --> 18:35.920
I may not know
what you're doing,

18:35.954 --> 18:37.116
but I know enough
about the human body

18:37.151 --> 18:38.146
to see that you
might kill this woman!

18:38.180 --> 18:39.242
Hold her down, son.

18:39.277 --> 18:40.272
I've got you.

18:42.031 --> 18:44.685
<i>I created Cortexiphan.</i>

18:44.719 --> 18:47.211
There is no better authority.

18:56.607 --> 18:58.532
Okay, that's enough.
Enough!

18:58.566 --> 19:01.125
One more.

19:01.159 --> 19:02.583
Come on.

19:02.617 --> 19:03.812
She needs all four.

19:03.847 --> 19:05.082
Walter,
I said that's enough.

19:05.116 --> 19:07.658
She has to cross over
four times.

19:07.692 --> 19:10.728
Do you want to leave her
stranded on the other side?

19:20.706 --> 19:24.008
Trust me.

19:42.753 --> 19:44.420
<i>There is an uncharacteristic</i>
<i>development</i>

19:44.520 --> 19:46.932
in the brain's
emotional centers.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.701
This is not normal.

19:48.735 --> 19:50.869
The limbic system
is vestigial,

19:50.903 --> 19:53.538
<i>and yet his</i>
<i>is substantially enlarged.</i>

19:53.572 --> 19:56.674
It has sent tendrils into
the brain's cognitive center,

19:56.708 --> 19:59.309
<i>integrating emotional</i>
<i>and intellectual activity</i>

19:59.343 --> 20:00.510
to an extent

20:00.544 --> 20:04.547
that we previously deemed
impossible.

20:11.121 --> 20:14.390
I will make the report.

20:42.955 --> 20:46.491
Sacrifice is hard, son,

20:46.525 --> 20:48.926
but you're
no stranger to it.

20:51.730 --> 20:55.333
Neither are you, Dad.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.070
You've sacrificed a lot.

21:00.138 --> 21:03.241
Peter...

21:03.275 --> 21:05.777
What is it?

21:16.589 --> 21:19.291
You're very strong, son.

21:24.430 --> 21:25.564
Come.

21:25.598 --> 21:29.034
Let's wake her up.

21:36.676 --> 21:38.110
Olivia?

21:45.818 --> 21:48.520
Olivia?

21:48.555 --> 21:51.189
Peter, I think we're gonna
get our daughter back.

21:51.224 --> 21:53.191
The plan
is gonna reset time.

21:53.226 --> 21:54.506
Olivia?

21:56.563 --> 21:59.765
How you feeling?

22:02.902 --> 22:04.735
Can I get you some water?

22:04.770 --> 22:08.507
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

22:11.611 --> 22:13.211
Have you figured out
how long I've got

22:13.246 --> 22:14.579
before it wears off?

22:14.614 --> 22:18.450
To be safe,
approximately 3 1/2 hours

22:18.485 --> 22:20.419
from the time
of your last injection.

22:20.453 --> 22:22.855
Any longer than that,
and, uh...

22:22.889 --> 22:25.424
You may become stranded.

22:25.459 --> 22:27.760
I've set this watch
accordingly.

22:29.663 --> 22:31.564
<i>And something else--</i>

22:31.598 --> 22:33.265
<i>with every jump,</i>

22:33.300 --> 22:34.967
a significant
amount of the drug

22:35.001 --> 22:37.370
will be burned up
in your system.

22:37.404 --> 22:40.239
<i>If it burns up too fast,</i>
<i>you may experience</i>

22:40.273 --> 22:41.974
<i>symptoms of withdrawal--</i>

22:42.009 --> 22:44.978
disorientation, hallucinations,
lapses in time.

22:45.012 --> 22:49.582
If this occurs,
you must cross back immediately.

22:49.617 --> 22:54.194
It is of paramount importance
that you do this.

22:55.964 --> 22:58.364
I understand.

23:12.980 --> 23:16.850
<i>Are you experiencing</i>
<i>any dizziness, headache?</i>

23:16.884 --> 23:18.418
From the Cortexiphan,

23:18.453 --> 23:22.990
or from the light that you
keep shining in my eyes?

23:28.964 --> 23:31.199
Be careful, dear.

23:31.233 --> 23:33.868
I will, Walter.

23:33.903 --> 23:35.571
We'll be waiting for you
at Battery Park

23:35.605 --> 23:38.943
when you cross back over.

23:50.991 --> 23:52.692
So, assuming Fringe Division

23:52.726 --> 23:54.861
is still in the same location
when you cross over,

23:55.513 --> 23:57.480
<i>you should be</i>
<i>right in front of it.</i>

23:57.515 --> 23:59.917
Are you sure
you can find her?

23:59.951 --> 24:03.253
I think she'll
probably find me.

24:04.956 --> 24:07.057
You're coming back.

24:07.091 --> 24:10.327
You're coming back
with the boy...

24:10.361 --> 24:13.563
for Etta.

24:16.567 --> 24:18.435
I love you.

24:18.469 --> 24:21.938
I love you too.

25:24.335 --> 25:28.605
We've got a breach.

25:56.765 --> 25:59.466
Dunham.

26:22.439 --> 26:24.840
Olivia?

26:29.312 --> 26:31.347
It's me.

26:31.381 --> 26:36.018
I was in amber
for--for 21 years.

26:57.041 --> 26:58.809
What are you doing here?

26:58.843 --> 27:01.044
I need your help.

27:02.487 --> 27:05.623
So, once you were ambered,
how did you get out?

27:05.657 --> 27:09.360
Our daughter freed us.

27:09.394 --> 27:11.895
<i>So you found her?</i>

27:14.032 --> 27:18.569
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>what you went through.</i>

27:26.778 --> 27:29.546
Liv?

27:29.581 --> 27:33.282
I'm sorry.
What was I saying?

27:33.317 --> 27:35.117
That you were hoping you
were going to see Etta again.

27:35.151 --> 27:37.785
<i>If the plan is successful.</i>

27:37.819 --> 27:39.453
Are you okay?

27:39.487 --> 27:42.222
Yeah.

27:43.157 --> 27:45.992
I don't have much time.

27:46.026 --> 27:47.226
So the boy is being held

27:47.261 --> 27:49.455
at a detention camp
on Liberty Island?

27:49.489 --> 27:50.854
On our side, yes.

27:50.888 --> 27:53.623
So my goal is
to cross over, grab him,

27:53.657 --> 27:55.257
and then bring him back
over here.

27:55.292 --> 27:57.359
Then we'll cross back home
through Battery Park.

27:57.394 --> 28:00.595
I'll arrange the transport
to Liberty Island.

28:02.431 --> 28:06.734
A lot's changed
since you've been here.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.769
Yeah, I can see that.

28:08.803 --> 28:11.304
Are you sure you're okay?

28:11.338 --> 28:13.172
Yeah.

29:29.275 --> 29:31.876
The deformity
of the anomaly's brain

29:31.911 --> 29:36.348
has resulted in profound
neurological changes.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.016
In what respect?

29:38.051 --> 29:42.521
It has developed an intellect
more advanced than our own

29:42.556 --> 29:45.991
and a capacity
for emotional responsiveness

29:46.026 --> 29:48.427
far greater
than the native humans.

29:51.732 --> 29:55.100
Curious.

29:55.135 --> 29:56.902
How is this possible?

29:56.937 --> 30:00.606
Unknown.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.507
It possesses capabilities

30:02.542 --> 30:05.744
our diagnostic instruments
cannot measure

30:05.778 --> 30:10.549
and that we are...

30:10.583 --> 30:14.052
unable to comprehend.

30:14.087 --> 30:19.426
That is very troubling.

30:19.460 --> 30:22.863
I believe the fugitives
intend to use the anomaly

30:22.897 --> 30:25.232
as a means
to our destruction.

30:30.138 --> 30:33.707
It would be to our
evolutionary advantage

30:33.742 --> 30:37.378
to continue
to study it further.

30:41.148 --> 30:45.152
A more prudent path
is to destroy it.

30:45.186 --> 30:49.323
There is no greater danger
than that which is unknown.

30:52.527 --> 30:55.763
It is irrelevant whether
the anomaly lives or dies.

30:55.797 --> 31:00.868
<i>What is valuable</i>
<i>is understanding what it was.</i>

31:00.902 --> 31:04.838
Disassemble it.

31:04.872 --> 31:08.308
Preserve the pieces.

31:13.615 --> 31:15.816
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go</i>
<i>check the schematics</i>

31:15.850 --> 31:17.117
at the facilities office.

31:17.151 --> 31:19.119
I'll be right back.

31:24.192 --> 31:25.760
It's so good to see you.

31:25.794 --> 31:28.463
You too.
What about Walternate?

31:28.497 --> 31:31.199
He retired from the D.O.D.
about 20 years ago,

31:31.233 --> 31:33.202
moved back to Boston.

31:33.236 --> 31:35.705
He's 90 years old.
He still lectures at Harvard.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.210
Can you believe that?

31:41.212 --> 31:45.682
It's crazy
how life works out.

31:49.930 --> 31:51.998
It's okay.

31:52.032 --> 31:56.335
I made my choices.
You made yours.

31:56.370 --> 31:58.238
I don't regret
any of them

31:58.272 --> 32:01.575
and neither should you.

32:03.545 --> 32:07.581
You deserve all the happiness
that you got.

32:11.119 --> 32:13.587
Okay, it's this way.

32:16.859 --> 32:19.495
You can stop checking out
my young ass.

32:27.370 --> 32:28.871
This is it?

32:28.905 --> 32:31.240
If your coordinates
are right, yeah,

32:31.274 --> 32:32.742
this is the same location
as the room

32:32.776 --> 32:35.344
that they're holding the boy
on your side.

32:35.379 --> 32:37.540
<i>We'll be here when you get
<i>back with him.</i></i>

32:38.148 --> 32:40.249
Hey...

32:40.283 --> 32:42.851
this will work.

32:42.886 --> 32:45.187
I got to go.

36:56.683 --> 36:59.985
There has been a breach
in security.

37:00.100 --> 37:04.236
Remain here
until it is resolved.

37:16.848 --> 37:19.450
Don't move.

37:19.484 --> 37:20.451
Michael.

37:20.485 --> 37:23.354
You okay?

37:23.388 --> 37:26.624
Okay, we're gonna get you
out of here.

38:08.303 --> 38:09.437
Behind you!

38:14.809 --> 38:16.644
You okay?

38:18.914 --> 38:21.882
You better get going.

38:21.917 --> 38:25.019
I'll be here in case
any more come across.

38:28.024 --> 38:29.191
Be careful.

38:29.225 --> 38:30.959
You too.

38:59.017 --> 39:01.383
Thank you.

39:01.418 --> 39:04.052
You have
a beautiful family.

39:04.087 --> 39:06.388
Thank you.

39:06.423 --> 39:08.557
Go save yours.

39:08.591 --> 39:12.427
Get your daughter back.

39:17.868 --> 39:21.504
Ready?
Okay.

39:28.044 --> 39:29.912
Liv.

39:29.947 --> 39:30.980
Hey.
Hey.

39:31.015 --> 39:33.049
You okay?
I think so.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.151
It's okay, Michael.
You're safe now.

39:35.186 --> 39:37.020
They know
that I crossed over.

39:37.055 --> 39:39.456
I don't think
that we have much time.

39:46.097 --> 39:49.266
You stay with her.
I'll drive.

40:16.191 --> 40:19.426
You asked to see me, sir?

40:22.029 --> 40:25.497
Is there a problem?

40:27.727 --> 40:29.590
You were one
of three officers

40:29.624 --> 40:32.392
who knew the high-value
detainee's location.

40:35.996 --> 40:40.429
If you imparted this
information to anyone else,

40:40.463 --> 40:42.831
I need to know.

40:50.206 --> 40:53.472
He told me that you
authorized it, sir.

40:54.807 --> 40:56.441
Who?

40:58.845 --> 41:01.347
Agent Broyles.

41:40.421 --> 41:43.990
I never thought
I'd see you again.

41:46.927 --> 41:50.063
Walter Bishop is back.

41:50.097 --> 41:52.398
We have the boy.

41:52.433 --> 41:56.336
There's something
I need you to do.

42:06.046 --> 42:07.913
You owe me.
