WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:05.443
Ok, so...

00:06.213 --> 00:08.173
Tell me about the job hunt.

00:08.290 --> 00:11.751
Did my little worker bee
find a happy hive?

00:12.738 --> 00:15.168
No. All the jobs
had the same problem...

00:15.215 --> 00:16.941
a dumbass boss.

00:18.138 --> 00:20.897
You know, one guy actually
thought that duct tape

00:20.932 --> 00:23.609
was called "duck" tape.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.118
A security guard
had to pull us apart.

00:27.611 --> 00:32.719
Oh, honey, you'll find something. You
worked at that auto parts plant for so long...

00:32.836 --> 00:35.957
did you try looking
at auto parts stores?

00:36.145 --> 00:38.528
Well, I'll be, kitty.

00:38.728 --> 00:42.856
And here I spent all morning
applying to be an astronaut.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

00:55.912 --> 00:58.216
what the hell is wrong
with your muffler?

00:58.774 --> 01:00.961
I hadn't noticed anything.

01:01.944 --> 01:05.524
Maybe I was too busy enjoying
my morning ice cream. That's right.

01:05.554 --> 01:10.221
My morning ice cream. Part of my new
"year off" philosophy, I want a treat,

01:10.271 --> 01:11.773
I get a treat.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.829
We haven't even had lunch yet.

01:14.864 --> 01:20.770
Eric never eats dessert before a meal. He used to say,
"when I finish my peas, I can eat what I please."

01:21.697 --> 01:23.692
I taught him that.

01:24.056 --> 01:29.129
I also taught him, "eat your asparagus,
or people will stare at us."

01:30.514 --> 01:32.910
It's not true, but he was little.

01:33.872 --> 01:37.390
Good lord. Is that
bubble gum ice cream?

01:37.437 --> 01:42.533
Well, it's not simply bubble gum ice cream.
It's frosty double bubble blast off.

01:43.707 --> 01:45.508
Why are you with him?

01:45.731 --> 01:47.750
I find him whimsical.

01:47.797 --> 01:49.324
So do I.

01:49.993 --> 01:52.741
Isn't that nice? They
find me whimsical.

01:54.371 --> 01:56.355
Who's got a bad muffler?

01:56.402 --> 01:59.702
See? Even bob knows
when a car sounds off.

01:59.737 --> 02:02.860
I never know what
you mean by "even bob"...

02:03.668 --> 02:06.578
but I like to assume
it's a compliment.

02:07.179 --> 02:09.304
Have you checked
your muffler lately?

02:09.351 --> 02:11.911
Uh, I'm gonna be honest
with you, I haven'T.

02:11.946 --> 02:15.208
But that green liquid stuff under
the hood seems to be at a

02:15.243 --> 02:17.192
really healthy level.

02:18.319 --> 02:19.259
Coolant.

02:19.987 --> 02:22.462
Donna, I think I can
handle this, okay?

02:22.826 --> 02:24.951
You cool it.

02:26.783 --> 02:28.225
All right, that's it.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.845
We're goin' to
the muffler shop.

02:30.021 --> 02:34.037
This whole family is gonna learn
a little lesson in muffler care today.

02:34.448 --> 02:38.533
Well, it's not a trip to europe,
but at least I get out of the house.

02:38.873 --> 02:44.262
Wait a second. You're not just tricking me into the car then
really taking me to the pediatrician for a booster shot, are you?

02:44.556 --> 02:45.449
No.

02:45.507 --> 02:46.567
Good.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.403
'Cause that only works twice.

02:54.581 --> 02:58.315
so, steven, did you have a good time
when you went out with your new dad?

02:58.456 --> 02:59.536
Yeah, it was all right.

02:59.572 --> 03:01.262
Well, have you called him yet?

03:01.309 --> 03:02.237
No.

03:03.082 --> 03:06.708
Well, I know if i went out with a boy
and he didn't call me after three days,

03:06.860 --> 03:09.080
I'd know he wasn't interested.

03:09.608 --> 03:12.144
Well, jackie, my dad and I aren't dating.

03:12.238 --> 03:15.277
We're a father and an illegitimate son.

03:17.743 --> 03:21.949
- Great news. I had a baby, and it's a girl.
- Hi, man..

03:22.014 --> 03:24.105
- Fantastic.
- Congratulations, man.

03:24.445 --> 03:29.940
See, michael, I'm trying to be happy for you,
but your hair is making it really hard.

03:30.586 --> 03:31.976
What happened?

03:32.035 --> 03:37.307
Well, I was waiting for brooke to have the baby,
right? And I was chewing gum, and then--

03:37.507 --> 03:41.709
and then I decided that I wanted
to blow a bubble as big as my head.

03:42.978 --> 03:44.798
And then I did.

03:45.749 --> 03:48.261
And then you probably figured
out the rest of the story.

03:48.297 --> 03:49.964
Oh, what's her name?

03:49.985 --> 03:53.097
- Betsy.
- fat girl's name.

03:54.048 --> 03:55.950
I don't know. I kinda like it.

03:56.138 --> 03:58.742
But, of course, I also like the larger ladies.

03:59.905 --> 04:05.646
Well, I had no say. If it was up to me, it
would've been something classy, like bambi.

04:07.446 --> 04:11.450
Man, do you even know what classy means? 'Cause
you're always sayin' things are classy when they aren't,

04:11.497 --> 04:13.834
like your "classy" carpeted van.

04:14.785 --> 04:16.721
The shaggin' wagon?

04:18.863 --> 04:22.652
- That had a buttload of class.
- Check it out.

04:23.948 --> 04:25.697
Wait, michael,

04:25.873 --> 04:28.456
these are all pictures of you.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.666
Yeah, I was the only thing
not covered in slime.

04:33.934 --> 04:36.306
Oh, here's one of brooke's boobs.

04:42.436 --> 04:44.961
Where did that one of brooke's boobs go?

04:46.663 --> 04:47.931
Oh, here we go.

04:48.189 --> 04:49.716
Here's a picture of the kid.

04:50.422 --> 04:52.900
Nice, kelso. She's got brooke's eyes

04:52.923 --> 04:55.518
and your fondness
for mooning the camera.

04:56.528 --> 04:59.416
Oh, michael, she is adorable.

04:59.475 --> 05:02.703
Hey, I brought cigars to celebrate.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.136
- Ooh, sweet.
- Fun.

05:04.191 --> 05:05.721
I love cigars.

05:06.274 --> 05:08.062
I hate cigars.

05:10.417 --> 05:12.833
This is way worse than what
we usually do in the circle.

05:12.868 --> 05:15.357
It tastes disgusting. It smells rank.

05:15.404 --> 05:17.412
It doesn't even make stuff funny.

05:17.835 --> 05:19.972
This should be illegal.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.034
I hate this.

05:23.863 --> 05:27.421
It's like smoking a dirty sock, only easier.

05:30.450 --> 05:31.888
I love cigars.

05:31.923 --> 05:33.614
I'm good at everything!

05:35.000 --> 05:37.800
I just threw up a little.

05:41.265 --> 05:44.482
That 70's show - Saison 7 Episode 3
(I can't get no) Satisfaction

05:44.515 --> 05:47.836
Synchro par Kiff
Correction par Guzo

05:47.899 --> 05:51.023
www.forom.com

05:51.086 --> 05:54.294
Merci a Raceman

06:20.016 --> 06:22.065
"Out of business"?

06:22.298 --> 06:26.081
I can't believe it. I loved this
place. How could this happen?

06:26.132 --> 06:29.365
Red, it's not your
ancestral home.

06:29.439 --> 06:33.725
Well, what kind of a town is this anymore
if we don't even have a muffler shop?

06:34.036 --> 06:35.999
A loud one.

06:36.751 --> 06:39.833
oh, cheer up. Maybe
this is good news.

06:40.127 --> 06:45.722
Ooh, what if something fun opens
up here next, like a button shop?

06:47.740 --> 06:53.635
we could come here as a family and just
dig and dig through big drawers of buttons.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.304
I think it sounds fun.

06:59.157 --> 07:03.872
Okay, you guys, I made a list of all the things
I want to do on my year off. Check out number five.

07:04.092 --> 07:06.921
"Jump into my car through the
window" like the duke boys."

07:06.957 --> 07:08.535
No, no, no, no.

07:08.664 --> 07:11.526
No, I already did that.
That should be crossed off.

07:11.838 --> 07:13.342
Number six.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.544
"Vandalize a local business."

07:15.580 --> 07:19.488
Yes, and today I happened to see
an out-of-business muffler shop.

07:19.525 --> 07:21.873
Imagine the muffler shop signs

07:21.910 --> 07:23.506
with the "l-e-r"

07:23.548 --> 07:25.933
scratched off the word "muffler."

07:27.456 --> 07:28.648
Eric...

07:28.978 --> 07:31.272
no, that's gross.

07:31.804 --> 07:34.721
What's gross? I don't get it.
I want to know what's gross.

07:35.271 --> 07:37.711
"Replace your old muffler"

07:38.152 --> 07:40.133
without the "ler"?

07:40.861 --> 07:43.081
"Replace your old mu--"

07:44.016 --> 07:45.502
oh, I get it.

07:47.227 --> 07:48.548
I get it.

07:49.043 --> 07:52.401
Okay. You know I'm digging
the new whimsical eric, but

07:52.437 --> 07:55.721
don't you think you could find a prank
that isn't highly offensive to women?

07:55.776 --> 07:58.400
Donna, you're asking me to play
tennis without a racket here.

07:58.451 --> 08:00.396
Okay, what if..

08:00.781 --> 08:07.386
what if you took "m-u-f" off the front of "muffler"
so the sign says stuff about "flers"? Right?

08:08.006 --> 08:12.959
That's french for "flowers," and people will be really
mad if they thought it was a french flower shop.

08:13.069 --> 08:14.280
Huh?

08:14.574 --> 08:17.289
Yeah, that sucks. Yours is funny. Go.

08:19.325 --> 08:24.839
I never thought this would happen, but
I have officially become more attractive.

08:25.426 --> 08:32.287
Tonight, I have a date with a chick who called my
single fatherhood the cutest thing she'd ever heard of.

08:32.342 --> 08:36.562
You know, I don't know why more guys don't
impregnate women and then not marry them.

08:37.498 --> 08:40.822
Maybe because it's irresponsible
and shortsighted.

08:40.876 --> 08:45.555
Okay, I might be irresponsible,
but my vision is perfect.

08:51.243 --> 08:53.536
"trade in your used muffler."

08:56.637 --> 08:57.954
It's brilliant.

08:59.110 --> 09:02.596
He's right. I am delighted and
disgusted at the same time.

09:02.633 --> 09:06.137
It's just nice to finally feel that
way when I'm not alone.

09:06.522 --> 09:09.769
- Hey, uh, let me ask you guys a question about my dad.
- Shoot.

09:09.861 --> 09:14.544
How often are you supposed to talk to the man who impregnated
your mom before she married the man you thought was your father?

09:14.581 --> 09:19.021
Um, I could check with some folks
in kentucky and get back to you.

09:19.223 --> 09:22.672
I could give you the number of some
first cousins who got married.

09:22.727 --> 09:25.222
Thanks, man. I don't really
want to talk to your parents.

09:25.626 --> 09:27.717
Oh! Good burn.

09:27.937 --> 09:34.832
Okay, ice cream's finished. Bubble gum,
I will save you for later. Guys, let's do this.

09:37.107 --> 09:39.400
"Winterize your muffler."

09:41.675 --> 09:46.327
You know, I almost hope we get arrested.
I really want this on my record.

09:54.986 --> 09:59.591
well, it's clear these baby pictures
are having the desired effect.

10:01.064 --> 10:05.338
Oh, here's another one after we
hosed her off and warmed her up.

10:05.393 --> 10:09.081
Oh, she's so cute.
Almost as cute as you.

10:09.118 --> 10:11.484
Yeah, she wishes.

10:12.016 --> 10:15.572
Oh, my gosh! I had that same
blankie when I was a baby.

10:15.608 --> 10:18.415
My daddy used to wrap me in it after my bath.

10:18.470 --> 10:20.543
Your daddy?

10:22.250 --> 10:23.919
Oh, my god.

10:24.396 --> 10:26.910
You're--you're somebody's daughter?

10:28.231 --> 10:29.687
So?

10:29.742 --> 10:35.393
So I'm thinking about how I would feel
if my baby girl was out with a guy like me.

10:35.943 --> 10:39.557
And it is not good! I'm all hands!

10:39.814 --> 10:43.043
That's okay, because I want you to...

10:44.694 --> 10:47.652
dude, that is not what that is for!

10:50.073 --> 10:51.266
Look at you,

10:51.633 --> 10:54.308
with your bright eyes and your rosy cheeks.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.246
I think vandalism really agrees with you.

10:57.875 --> 11:01.104
Well, donna, I think I've really turned
a corner here. I'm tough,

11:01.134 --> 11:02.572
I'm gritty...

11:03.497 --> 11:05.742
okay, I've got paint under my fingernails.

11:06.357 --> 11:09.968
I may need to borrow
my mother's manicure set.

11:10.027 --> 11:13.476
No, leave it. It makes you
look dangerous. Like...

11:13.583 --> 11:16.248
like you don't even know
what a manicure set is.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.969
Donna, you got a little something
on your face. I got it.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.754
Kitty, come on in here.

11:26.326 --> 11:28.630
Boy, have I got big news.

11:28.733 --> 11:31.166
- What's going on?
- We just came from the bank.

11:31.210 --> 11:34.381
You know that muffler shop
that went out of business?

11:34.469 --> 11:35.731
I bought it.

11:35.775 --> 11:37.228
Oh, no!

11:41.617 --> 11:44.843
Do the oh, no
oh, no!

11:44.931 --> 11:47.426
Do the oh, no
oh, no!

11:47.470 --> 11:48.615
Come on!

11:48.645 --> 11:50.156
Everybody.

11:50.611 --> 11:53.415
Do the oh, no
say what?

11:53.444 --> 11:56.332
Do the oh, no
right now

12:01.572 --> 12:03.965
what the hell?

12:10.292 --> 12:13.257
- Yeah,
- "what the hell?" Is right.

12:13.521 --> 12:16.383
Who would do such an irresponsible and

12:16.442 --> 12:18.438
ironic thing?

12:19.560 --> 12:22.760
Certainly not anyone I would
want to make out with.

12:24.052 --> 12:25.666
I mean the opposite of that.

12:26.796 --> 12:30.656
Okay, you gotta admit it.
This one's pretty funny.

12:32.846 --> 12:35.429
I'm sorry. I love wordplay.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.999
I don't get it.

12:37.484 --> 12:39.847
What's so funny about a muff?

12:41.065 --> 12:44.074
- Kitty...
- I mean, muffs aren't funny.

12:44.396 --> 12:49.212
I have a beautiful gray one
that I have been using for years.

12:49.785 --> 12:52.383
For the love of god,

12:52.852 --> 12:54.041
please.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.901
- Just tell me what's so funny about my
- nothing.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.268
Nothing is funny.

13:00.326 --> 13:02.073
Exactly.

13:02.748 --> 13:05.038
Would you look at this?

13:06.359 --> 13:09.338
Bubble gum ice cream?

13:12.009 --> 13:13.417
Okay,

13:13.578 --> 13:15.178
good start.

13:16.015 --> 13:19.728
Now let's fan out and
search for more clues.

13:26.292 --> 13:30.402
So then I realized that kimberly
is some guy's daughter.

13:31.825 --> 13:35.113
Yeah, he probably loves her
as much as I love my daughter,

13:35.157 --> 13:41.161
and then I had to go and take a boiling hot
shower and scrub until a little skin came off.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.094
So the joy of having a daughter
has come with some tragedy.

13:45.138 --> 13:48.573
You can no longer treat women
like meaningless whores.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.730
Sucker!

13:52.520 --> 13:55.500
Steven, see, fathers love their children,

13:55.544 --> 13:58.655
just like your new daddy
loves you, so call him.

13:59.844 --> 14:00.593
No.

14:02.002 --> 14:04.145
Steven, you never do anything I say.

14:04.203 --> 14:08.610
If you were a dog or someone who worked for me,
I'd smack you in the nose with a newspaper.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.252
All right,

14:11.476 --> 14:16.551
you guys, this is serious! I may
never be able to have sex again,

14:16.976 --> 14:21.571
now that I realize that women
are more than just sex objects.

14:21.909 --> 14:27.706
Hey, is this like the time you realized you wanted to be
a cop or like the time you realized that you were a robot?

14:29.424 --> 14:33.223
My eyes were red in all of my pictures.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.829
You know, I just don't believe
that you've changed this much.

14:38.873 --> 14:40.092
For example,

14:40.547 --> 14:46.209
what would you do if I were
to lean way over like this?

14:50.392 --> 14:52.711
What are you doing?
Grab it, man!

14:55.571 --> 15:00.047
I can't! I respect women now!
Listen, what am I gonna do?

15:00.091 --> 15:02.792
It's no big deal, man.
You can, um, just...

15:02.836 --> 15:07.031
- ...never have sex again.
- With this body?

15:07.677 --> 15:11.096
All right, the people would
riot in the streets.

15:12.124 --> 15:15.280
You know, you could engage
in a meaningful relationship.

15:15.324 --> 15:19.697
Donna, this is no time for
your feminist mumbo-jumbo.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.132
Okay, wait, you guys,
he doesn't wanna change.

15:23.176 --> 15:27.682
He wants to feel like he's respecting women
while still acting like a shallow creep.

15:28.298 --> 15:31.126
You know, you've always gotten me, jackie.

15:32.270 --> 15:38.376
That's it. I need a loophole so I can keep doing
what I'm doing without being a bad father.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.958
The father!

15:40.017 --> 15:42.233
The father is the key.

15:42.292 --> 15:44.596
Oh, so we kill the father.

15:47.810 --> 15:50.911
Yeah, that's.. that's not what I meant.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.509
Oh, me either.

15:58.088 --> 16:00.730
Well, of course steven should call his dad.

16:00.771 --> 16:03.516
I know, but he won't do it,
and I've tried everything--

16:03.560 --> 16:06.510
nagging him, poking him, smacking him.

16:07.552 --> 16:09.915
You know, my bag of tricks is empty.

16:10.473 --> 16:12.297
Well, he needs a father.

16:12.327 --> 16:17.698
The day is fast approaching when someone's gonna
have to talk to him about the birds and the bees.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.061
Well, actually, mrs. Forman...

16:20.120 --> 16:22.850
yes, it's fast, fast approaching.

16:24.024 --> 16:29.258
- Oh! Here he comes. Okay, please do something.
- Okay. I'm good at this.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.716
Oh, this is steven's father, you say?

16:36.401 --> 16:41.618
You really wanna talk to him but
he has to call you first, you say?

16:42.407 --> 16:44.003
Mrs. Forman?

16:44.095 --> 16:47.104
I know you're not really
on the phone with my dad.

16:47.929 --> 16:49.381
Oh, you do?

16:50.026 --> 16:51.733
Oh, you do?

16:53.164 --> 16:55.241
Well, you're right.

16:55.431 --> 17:01.172
- I thought you said you were good at this.
- He is a lot savvier than eric.

17:03.144 --> 17:06.464
Why can't you guys just let me
do things my own way?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.125
Because I know meeting
your dad meant a lot to you.

17:09.159 --> 17:14.828
And every time something means a lot to you,
you push it away before it can push you away.

17:14.864 --> 17:21.579
And every time something means a lot to me,
I smother it, which is why we're such a good couple.

17:22.550 --> 17:23.665
Fine.

17:23.740 --> 17:27.923
I'll call, if you both promise to stop bothering
me about it and let me do it by myself.

17:27.978 --> 17:30.418
- Absolutely.
- Anything you want.

17:34.986 --> 17:37.188
I wish I had a camera.

17:39.385 --> 17:42.265
Can I just get a picture
of you holding the phone?

17:42.394 --> 17:45.311
- I'm hanging up.
- We're going. Going.

17:50.613 --> 17:52.759
Yeah, hi. William barnett, please.

17:52.943 --> 17:54.957
Hey, man, it's steven.

17:55.031 --> 17:57.801
Tell him you love him!
Daddy, daddy, he loves you!

18:03.140 --> 18:05.580
hello, sir. I'm here to pick up kimberly.

18:05.617 --> 18:08.717
And I figure if I'm up-front
with you about my intentions,

18:08.765 --> 18:11.059
we can all feel good
about our date.

18:11.114 --> 18:12.141
Now

18:12.196 --> 18:15.847
I'm about to do things of a sexual
nature with your daughter.

18:15.900 --> 18:19.584
And even though she does
those things... with everyone,

18:20.545 --> 18:24.699
I have a new respect for the father/daughter
relationship now that I have a daughter...

18:24.743 --> 18:28.485
out of wedlock. I'm no longer
with the mother. Don't worry.

18:28.720 --> 18:34.163
So I figure with your permission, I can
proceed to pleasure her time and time again.

18:34.187 --> 18:35.791
What do you say?

18:44.985 --> 18:48.251
I can't believe red
bought the muffler shop.

18:48.489 --> 18:52.177
All right, that's it. New
eric's out, old eric's back.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.378
I should probably just
go upstairs and

18:54.433 --> 18:56.466
think about what I've done.

18:56.943 --> 18:58.135
Come on.

18:58.319 --> 19:00.374
You can't turn back now.

19:00.429 --> 19:03.713
You're like an explorer,
discovering a new you.

19:03.951 --> 19:07.657
When columbus discovered america instead
of the west indies, did he go to his room?

19:07.709 --> 19:12.681
No, he waded into mexico
and stole all of their gold.

19:13.469 --> 19:16.515
Okay, I'm not following.

19:16.919 --> 19:20.845
I think it's hot when you do naughty
stuff, and I want you to keep doing it.

19:21.395 --> 19:24.521
You know what? It is hot.

19:24.602 --> 19:28.436
And I'm not gonna let red bully me out of it.
I mean, how often was I hot before?

19:28.473 --> 19:31.170
Almost never, right!

19:31.445 --> 19:34.105
But now I am hot, and hot..

19:34.179 --> 19:35.848
I will stay.

19:36.490 --> 19:38.805
Let's celebrate.

19:39.741 --> 19:41.998
one of red's beers?

19:42.603 --> 19:45.832
There's a new sheriff
in town, little lady.

19:47.226 --> 19:50.455
Well, if it isn't my son the vandal.

19:50.547 --> 19:54.286
You know, I oughta vandalize
your ass with my foot.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.891
Look, I said I was sorry
and I'd fix up the shop.

19:58.983 --> 20:01.001
Come on, dad. Aren't we..

20:01.533 --> 20:05.184
aren't we getting a little old
for this whole dance?

20:05.771 --> 20:09.194
I mean, here we are, shaking
our booties, and I mean...

20:09.505 --> 20:11.597
disco's dead.

20:12.184 --> 20:15.083
You're not taking dance
classes again, are you? 

20:15.468 --> 20:16.385
No.

20:16.899 --> 20:18.936
I'm saying here's
what's gonna happen.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.779
You're gonna accept my
apology, man to man,

20:21.834 --> 20:24.413
and then sit down with
me and my girl here

20:24.505 --> 20:26.596
and enjoy this beer.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.633
No.

20:28.890 --> 20:30.981
Here's what's gonna happen.

20:32.210 --> 20:37.035
You are gonna put down that
beer and go to your room.

20:38.063 --> 20:39.861
Or...

20:40.896 --> 20:43.355
here's what's gonna happen.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.281
I am gonna go to my room,

20:45.336 --> 20:46.969
but first...

20:48.804 --> 20:51.409
I'm gonna chug this beer.

20:52.069 --> 20:54.436
Chug it, eric.

20:58.247 --> 21:00.577
Okay, that's really fizzy.

21:02.393 --> 21:04.595
But I think I made my point.

21:06.209 --> 21:09.310
Now you put some saran warp on that.

21:12.450 --> 21:14.748
And i will finish it later.

21:20.663 --> 21:27.194
I will have you know that my friend linda
just filled me in on some slang words

21:27.534 --> 21:31.386
that some people in
my family find funny,

21:31.790 --> 21:37.092
and now I can never feel
comfortable with my muff again.

21:37.569 --> 21:40.046
- Mom, you..
- don't laugh, mister.

21:40.083 --> 21:44.450
When you were a baby, I used to put
you in it when you got out of the tub.

21:45.727 --> 21:48.105
Okay, this isn't funny anymore.

21:48.413 --> 21:49.881
Stop!
