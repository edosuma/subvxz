Whoever heard of a heatwave
in the Arctic?

01:08.530 --> 01:10.320
Welcome to the new normal.

01:10.730 --> 01:14.510
We're standing on a gigantic ice cap,
and it's 32 Fahrenheit.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.600
Welcome to the Arctic summer.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.130
Fahrenheit?

01:18.140 --> 01:21.500
Wait, did you just use
that antiquated Imperial measurement?

01:21.840 --> 01:24.100
Yeah, I did, Sweden.

This is some mean ice.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.500
That's why they call it
the Old Cold!

01:55.510 --> 01:57.670
Yeah, well, I reckon just
increase the bit speed.

02:03.220 --> 02:06.120
I'm getting a seismic spike
in the ice.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.490

just an isostatic rebound.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.430
There are no big life forms
that live in solid ice.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.960
Maybe the backscatter effect
brought up a rock formation.

02:28.970 --> 02:30.670
Yeah, and maybe
it's the Easter Bunny!

02:30.680 --> 02:34.370

as shit isn't the Easter Bunny.

you've done with the place.

without the sarcasm, son.

09:47.210 --> 09:49.470
and my style's way too
improvisational for you, okay?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.110
Lord, you're giving me
a headache.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.310

go stock some shelves.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.720

Take a message.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.060
I tried,

12:25.170 --> 12:27.400
but there's a lady
holding on the line,

12:27.410 --> 12:30.400
who's got a very sexy
phone voice, by the way.

12:30.410 --> 12:33.640
She told me to tell you
that they've got, uh...

12:33.650 --> 12:35.440
I can't read my writing.

12:35.450 --> 12:39.210
What does that word...
What does that say? That she's got, uh...

12:40.590 --> 12:42.480
- Graboids? Where?
- Mr. Gummer?

12:42.490 --> 12:43.910
Affirmative. Who's this?

12:43.920 --> 12:46.650
Dr. Rita Sims. I'm calling
from Nunavut Province, Canada.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.280
We're 67 degrees north.

12:48.290 --> 12:51.190
- That's the Canadian Arctic.
- Yes, it is.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.960
I'm the station leader of
an international research team.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.190
<i>We' re based at Boîte Canyon.</i>

12:56.200 --> 12:57.990
How'd you get this number?
You from the government?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.190
Is she hot?

12:59.200 --> 13:01.730
Well, I have an associate
familiar with your work.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.470
I think your associate
must be half a bubble off plumb.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.770
That was my first reaction,
but she's actually very bright.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.840
She knows a lot
about Graboid mythology.

13:10.850 --> 13:14.310
Graboids are no myth,
but they're a desert phenomenon.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.580
I think this is
a colossal time suck, Miss, uh...

13:17.590 --> 13:19.380
Dr. Sims.

13:19.390 --> 13:22.680
Graboids do not and cannot
exist in the Arctic, Dr. Sims!

13:22.690 --> 13:24.850
- Impossible.
- Ask her if she's hot.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.620
Improbable but not impossible.

13:27.630 --> 13:29.220
- Who's this?
- This is Valerie.

13:29.230 --> 13:31.830
First, let me say that,
as a major Graboid enthusiast,

13:31.840 --> 13:35.600
I have admired your work
for years. Here's what I know.

13:35.610 --> 13:38.300
Graboids are subterranean
worm-like predator

13:38.310 --> 13:42.400
unlike any other life form cataloged
in Earth's genetic or fossil record.

13:42.410 --> 13:44.940
<i>When fully grown,
a Graboid can reach up</i>

13:44.950 --> 13:47.310
to 10 meters in length
and weigh up to 20 tons.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.680
Their semi-rigid internal structure
is covered by a leathery carapace.

13:50.690 --> 13:53.660
<i>They're daytime hunters
and have no eyes,</i>

13:53.690 --> 13:56.690
but what's most fascinating
to me about their predatory acuity

13:56.700 --> 13:58.920
is that it's based on vibration.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.890
Go on. I'm listening.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.990
They have a massive black armored beak
and two hooked mandibles,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.460
one on either side of their jaw.

14:05.470 --> 14:09.600
<i>The species is Precambrian and have long
and powerful snake-like tentacles,</i>

14:09.610 --> 14:12.070
<i>which can reach three meters
to ensnare their prey.</i>

14:12.080 --> 14:13.640
If you'd like,
I can give you the 411

14:13.650 --> 14:15.040
On the morphological
subspecies

14:15.050 --> 14:17.840
known as the Ass Blaster
a.k.a. <i>Mexicana Combustus.</i>

14:17.850 --> 14:20.880
You're a treasure-trove of
Graboidology, Miss, but I...

14:20.890 --> 14:24.510
You've hunted and killed them
on two different continents, Mr. Gummer.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.380
That's why I insisted
that we call.

14:26.390 --> 14:29.420
But why are you so sure
this is a Graboid attack?

14:30.230 --> 14:32.820
The kill site
has all the telltale signs.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.420
Except for location.

14:35.470 --> 14:38.460
I don't know.
Call it a gut feeling, intuition.

14:38.470 --> 14:41.370
We need your help, Mr. Gummer,
and we need it ASAP!

14:41.410 --> 14:44.200
<i>Think of the adventure,
Graboids in the Arctic.</i>

14:44.210 --> 14:46.610
This could be
a whole new ballgame.

14:47.910 --> 14:49.000
Batter up!

14:49.010 --> 14:51.140
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.210
You never asked
if she was hot!

15:17.140 --> 15:19.900
- Where are you going?
- Round two! I'm coming with.

15:19.910 --> 15:21.640
Request denied.

15:21.950 --> 15:25.210
What? Come on, here,
stop being Burt for a minute,

15:25.220 --> 15:26.880
and logic this thing out
with me.

15:26.890 --> 15:30.380
This is our chance to revive
Burt Gummer's Bull's-Eye Brand,

15:30.390 --> 15:32.510
get you free
of the taxman, dude!

15:32.520 --> 15:34.420
Let's be honest. You've got
a lot of red in your ledger.

15:34.430 --> 15:37.620
My financial status
is none of your damn beeswax.

15:37.630 --> 15:39.150
And you'll just be in the way.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.520
Oh, like I was
in South Africa? Huh?

15:42.530 --> 15:45.230
That was a one-off!
Nothing more.

15:45.340 --> 15:49.230
You're looking at this through the wrong
end of the telescope here, friend.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.730
What about your legacy, huh?

15:50.740 --> 15:51.930
What about it?

15:51.940 --> 15:54.470
Do you know of any other
Graboid hunters out there?

15:54.480 --> 15:56.500
Uh, I don't.

15:56.820 --> 15:59.570
I know, you know,
Bigfoot hunters... No!

15:59.580 --> 16:02.640
You're Burt Gummer.
You're a one-off!

16:02.650 --> 16:05.750
Come on, man, teach me!
Pay it forward.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.480
Oh, I'm not dead yet.

16:07.490 --> 16:11.020
I know, and I'm not interested in
talking about your mortality, either,

16:11.030 --> 16:13.450
but think about it.
Who's gonna fill your shoes

16:13.460 --> 16:16.560
when you can no longer outrun
or outgun these beasts, huh?

16:16.570 --> 16:18.190
I've got to
tell you something.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.500
Burt Gummer's got
some big-ass shoes to fill.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.030
Size 12s.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.030
I've seen you
in the locker room.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
And you're my heir apparent.
Is that it?

16:27.050 --> 16:28.770
You already led me through
one Graboid gauntlet.

16:28.780 --> 16:33.370
- There's a lot you still don't know.
- Exactly my point.

16:33.380 --> 16:36.820
Learning can be fun!
Rosetta Stone me, dawg.

16:37.220 --> 16:40.280
It was a decent enough
combat primer.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.220
Hell, yeah, it was!
I was your wingman.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.190
Wingman?
More like wingnut!

16:44.200 --> 16:46.320
Come on, that's...

16:46.800 --> 16:48.590
That's a little harsh,
I think.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.690
(SIGHS)

16:50.700 --> 16:52.190
Damn it!

16:54.710 --> 16:56.870
Are you willing to follow orders?

16:57.410 --> 16:58.700
I mean, sometimes, I don't...

16:58.710 --> 17:02.540
Look, the most important
six inches on the battlefield

17:02.550 --> 17:05.020
are between your ears.
You got that?

17:05.849 --> 17:08.609
I'd like to think I have more.
I think I'm 6.5.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.410
Don't crack wise with me.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.780
Sir, yes, sir!

17:11.790 --> 17:12.980
And have you filled out

17:12.990 --> 17:18.690
the requisite non-resident
special exemption RCMP-5590 form?

17:18.700 --> 17:19.990
Sir...

17:20.000 --> 17:24.990
- What?
- The RCMP-5590 form!

17:25.069 --> 17:28.560
For that firearm you're
planning on bringing into Canada.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.270
No.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.580
Well, then you better download
one and fill it out pronto.

17:34.850 --> 17:36.940
Grab your arctic gear.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.710
Man!

17:40.550 --> 17:43.610
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

18:01.440 --> 18:04.430
Welcome to
the Great White North, eh!

18:04.440 --> 18:07.100
Otherwise known
as Nowheresville.

18:07.110 --> 18:10.170
You're about 1,000 miles
north of there.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.310
You're somewhere
between, uh,

18:12.320 --> 18:15.810
Ain't-Never-Been
and Don't-Wanna-Go.

18:15.950 --> 18:17.680
TRAVIS: Where are
all the glaciers?

18:17.690 --> 18:22.920
Melting. Sled dog unemployment's
at an all-time high.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.490
How much longer
till we're there?

18:25.500 --> 18:29.160
Not far.
Just around the bend.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.330
Where's your GPS?

18:31.340 --> 18:33.830
You're in the Arctic Circle.

18:33.870 --> 18:37.870
Satellites up here
are more miss than hit.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.340
But don't worry.
It's all up here.

18:41.350 --> 18:43.340
That's reassuring.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.440
How is it back there,
Mr. Gummer?

18:45.450 --> 18:48.410
My seismic vibration monitor
is completely useless.

18:48.420 --> 18:52.680
Yeah, well, you can log in to the
inter-Web when we get you on station.

18:52.690 --> 18:57.350
- Peachy.
- Hey, I'm a big fan of your series.

18:57.360 --> 19:02.620
I loved that episode on dried meats
and insects as proteins.

19:02.630 --> 19:07.260
I see you're smuggling home-brew
grain alcohol into dry territory.

19:07.270 --> 19:11.370
Well, the local tribal authority
are a bit blue-nosed,

19:11.380 --> 19:14.540
so I'm forced to bring it
in under the radar.

19:14.550 --> 19:16.940
Don't ask, don't tell, right?

19:16.950 --> 19:18.280
BURT: Yeah.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.490
I see it.

19:29.990 --> 19:31.390
- It can't be.
- It is.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.260
- It is what?
- We got a hostile aerial incursion.

19:34.270 --> 19:35.920
What's your altitude?

19:35.930 --> 19:37.090
1,400 feet.

19:37.100 --> 19:41.660
I suggest you take evasive
action and put this plane on the ground.

- Yeah, they're heat seekers.
- Who's they?

is a draw!

into a First Nations territory?

21:47.970 --> 21:49.660
That is a big time no-no!

You don't mind if we help
ourselves now, do you?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.700
Well, there's a matter
of payment, eh?

21:55.710 --> 21:57.700
Put it on my tab.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.640

you be?

22:07.450 --> 22:08.810
I'm your next-door neighbor

22:08.820 --> 22:10.710
while you're up here
on your little worm hunt.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.660
But there's no welcome mat
on my doorstep, so tread lightly.

22:15.730 --> 22:18.690
A piece of advice, Mr. Gummer.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.160
You stay out of my way
and pay your taxes.

22:22.530 --> 22:25.300
Consider yourself
properly warned.

22:26.370 --> 22:27.860
Do I know you?

22:27.870 --> 22:30.670
I don't know. Do you?

22:31.880 --> 22:35.500
Since we're neighbors,
here's some neighborly advice.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.870
Beat a retreat until I get
this area cleared out.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.110
Retreat? Hell, no. We're just
getting started up here.

22:43.350 --> 22:45.610
Then find a safe place
to hunker down.

22:45.620 --> 22:48.020
Consider yourself
properly warned.

22:53.630 --> 22:55.290
You know that skid mark?

about him?

he's up here working

for evil.

Hey, Mac. I saw you came in
a bit hectic there, huh?

Yeah, just a little bit.

from Burning Man, or...

23:48.050 --> 23:50.680
Wow! They even know you
in Canada!

23:50.690 --> 23:53.450
You failed to tell me
about the AB infestation.

- We have Ass Blasters?
- Yeah.

gonna believe it.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.760
I'm Val and Rhonda's daughter.

No! Val and Rhonda from
the OG Graboid apocalypse?

I am.

24:11.780 --> 24:15.800
Uh... I kind of lost track
of your parents over the years.

24:15.810 --> 24:19.610
It's okay. They're easy
to lose track of, especially Val.

Everybody's waiting.

Yeah, BSA .303. Nice.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.180
It'll kill most varmints.

25:30.190 --> 25:32.510
Yeah, well, for the varmints
we're hunting,

25:32.520 --> 25:35.820
that's like shooting
a slingshot at a Sherman tank.

25:35.830 --> 25:38.790
I thought it'd be colder than a
reindeer's ball bag up here.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.050
We're in the middle
of an Arctic heat wave,

25:40.060 --> 25:42.220

the snow melt.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.100
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.440
This is Dr. Ferezze.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.810
- Charles Ferezze.
- Doc.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.010
How was your flight in?

26:02.020 --> 26:05.750
Well, let's just say, uh,
we hit some chop.

26:06.860 --> 26:08.880
We blew the engine.

26:08.890 --> 26:10.990
Actually, we came
under Ass Blaster attack,

26:11.000 --> 26:15.420
and during the ensuing
aerial dogfight, the engine was blown.

26:15.430 --> 26:17.760
- An Ass Blaster?
- Yeah.

26:17.770 --> 26:19.460
Blew the engine?

26:19.470 --> 26:22.130
But you have to fly me
back to Montreal so I can report

26:22.140 --> 26:24.770
to the powers that be about
the recent turn of events.

26:24.780 --> 26:29.270
Well, they'll just have to wait till
I get this puppy airborne again.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.510
I can't stay here
one more minute!

26:32.320 --> 26:35.650
Excuse me. I've got
an engine to fix.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.880
DR. FEREZZE: Excuse me.
(LAUGHS)

26:37.890 --> 26:41.280
Dr. Ferezze, he startles
at the drop of a feather.

I'm sorry.
We haven't met yet.

26:48.870 --> 26:50.530
Thank you for coming.

26:50.900 --> 26:54.430

get the lay of the land.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.470
Well, it's the Land of
the Midnight Sun, Mr. Welker.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.510
Are you saying that the sun
is never going down on me?

27:05.520 --> 27:08.180
Well, it's never gonna go
below the horizon,

27:08.690 --> 27:10.710
if that's what you're asking.

27:10.820 --> 27:13.510
RITA: We sent a three-man
drill team to the glacial field

about a half a day
up mountain from here.

Well, from the kill site.

a partially eaten pelvis,
and a half-eaten testicle.

27:41.550 --> 27:43.980
How do you recover
a half-eaten testicle?

27:43.990 --> 27:47.150
Now, where's all
the snow, Dr. Sims?

27:47.160 --> 27:50.680
This year in particular has been one
of the warmest on record up here.

27:50.690 --> 27:52.490
Meet Hart Hansen, Mr. Gummer.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.720
He's a PhD in Geomorphology
from the University of Cambridge.

27:55.730 --> 27:57.960
Ah, yeah, airplane boy.

27:57.970 --> 28:01.230
It's an RC. Kind of a hobby.

28:01.810 --> 28:04.070
It's actually a habit, um...

28:04.940 --> 28:07.200
Okay, it's an addiction. Anyway,

28:07.210 --> 28:08.670
it's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Gummer.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.170
I'm sure you'll find
that Boîte Canyon

28:10.180 --> 28:12.510
is a very unique
geological phenomenon.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.880
VALERIE: This perennially
frozen tundra is interrupted

28:14.890 --> 28:17.510
for approximately
10 square kilometers by thawed soil.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.010
Thawed?
It's bone dry out there.

28:20.020 --> 28:22.050
The Meltwater Hot Springs
are a pleasant symptom

28:22.060 --> 28:24.590
of geothermal heat, which warms
the Earth from deep beneath the land

28:24.600 --> 28:25.820
that we're standing on.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.190
That explains the ABs.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.420
Ass Blasters!

28:28.430 --> 28:30.370
(ALL LAUGHING)

28:30.730 --> 28:33.530
- Ass Blasters...
- You think this is funny?

28:35.670 --> 28:39.940
These creatures are no joke.
They are all-go, no-quit killing machines.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.140
Now, I'm sorry for the loss
of your friends,

28:42.150 --> 28:44.570
but if you don't do exactly
as I say,

28:44.580 --> 28:46.740
they won't be the last
to die around here.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.410
Not funny, Mr. Gummer.
We get it.

28:49.450 --> 28:52.080
The permafrost at a higher
elevation is melting,

28:52.090 --> 28:56.860
so the tundra is more easily breached.
Ergo, Graboids.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.060
You're telling me melting ice caps
and warmer temperatures

29:01.070 --> 29:05.390
are causing this, uh,
Graboid Arctic stampede?

29:05.400 --> 29:06.890
Kind of, but there's more.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.630
(SCOFFS) Enlighten me.
Why here?

29:09.640 --> 29:11.700
Evolution, Mr. Gummer.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.100
There's one thing
Nature has taught us,

29:13.110 --> 29:15.940
and that's life can expand
into new territories.

29:15.950 --> 29:17.810
Maybe these are
the first Graboids.

29:17.820 --> 29:21.440
- Yeah, like pre-Precambrian.
- VALERIE: Exactly.

29:21.450 --> 29:25.080
And maybe they migrated south millions,
maybe even billions of years ago

29:25.090 --> 29:26.810
and evolved into a desert creature.

29:26.820 --> 29:29.880
And now, after countless
giga-annum lying dormant in ice...

29:29.890 --> 29:31.290
They've awakened.

29:31.300 --> 29:35.390

like a bunch of sassafras!

29:35.470 --> 29:37.870

30:08.570 --> 30:10.260

30:16.970 --> 30:18.460

30:31.290 --> 30:33.710
Yes, them.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.980
What's your association
with them?

30:35.990 --> 30:37.890
They're our

30:37.900 --> 30:41.160
Why are we whispering?
They can't hear us.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.790
When did they arrive?

30:43.800 --> 30:46.430
They arrived a couple
of months ago.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.860
They're working on some
US-Canadian project.

30:48.870 --> 30:50.060
It's very hush-hush.

30:50.070 --> 30:52.700

30:59.980 --> 31:01.710

31:01.720 --> 31:04.480
You think that
our research neighbors

31:04.490 --> 31:07.680
are breeding these creatures
as bio-weapons?

31:07.690 --> 31:10.220

43:30.070 --> 43:31.760
Well, how do we get them?

43:32.340 --> 43:33.820
From a Graboid.

43:34.470 --> 43:37.170
Maybe we can get one
to stop by the blood bank.

We get it done.

44:02.070 --> 44:03.220
I got this, Burt.

44:03.230 --> 44:07.640
The antibodies need to be extracted
from a live Graboid to be viable.

before they come blasting through
the floor and eat our lunch.

51:55.940 --> 51:58.660
I've got an idea.
The generator's in the hangar, right?

51:58.670 --> 52:01.970
Yeah. Triple-phase power,
63-amp cables.

52:01.980 --> 52:03.570
According to
these blueprints,

52:03.580 --> 52:05.600
this hangar's got
a deep-pile foundation.

52:05.610 --> 52:08.240
Yeah, steel caissons going
directly into the bedrock.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.310
Drilled it myself.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.910
You think you can re-route
the power so it goes to the steel caissons?

52:12.920 --> 52:14.580
Are you saying
what I'm thinking?

52:14.590 --> 52:15.980
What are you thinking
I'm saying?

52:15.990 --> 52:18.350
I'm thinking that you're saying that
we shoot a dose of milliamps

52:18.360 --> 52:20.290
straight into the groundwater
and create some kind of...

52:20.300 --> 52:23.360
- Underground electrical fence.
- Exactly.

52:23.370 --> 52:26.360
That's exactly what I'm saying
you're thinking. Can you do it?

52:26.370 --> 52:27.660
I've done more with less.

52:27.670 --> 52:30.100
Yeah, but if
it doesn't work, we die.

Have you ever nailed Jell-O to a wall?

52:34.010 --> 52:35.330
I'm not sure
how that's relevant.

52:35.340 --> 52:37.800
It's relevant
because I did it.

52:37.810 --> 52:40.010
And guess what? It stuck.

52:40.020 --> 52:42.310
You know why?
Because everyone said I couldn't.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.650
All right, I got it.
I got it!

52:45.090 --> 52:48.280

52:58.100 --> 53:00.090
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't just hear you leave me out

because I'm coming
on this worm hunt.

53:03.010 --> 53:06.570

Think you can bang on this short arm?

53:06.580 --> 53:10.200
Piece of cake. You zero that scope
for distance or dangerous game?

53:10.350 --> 53:12.510
- What do you think?
- Stupid question.

53:12.520 --> 53:15.480
Mind if I tweak it for
my preferred point of impact?

53:17.390 --> 53:21.050
Dad and I always zeroed our scopes
at 2.5 inches high at 100 yards.

53:21.320 --> 53:23.020
Well, whatever floats your boat.

53:23.030 --> 53:25.550
You're on overwatch.
Take Vargas and go on the roof.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.720
Roger that.

53:26.730 --> 53:29.490
And hold on tight, huh?
She'll kick some!

53:29.500 --> 53:30.990
Got you.

53:31.700 --> 53:33.790
The gun or Vargas?

53:37.870 --> 53:39.400
You feel up for this, old man?

53:39.410 --> 53:41.030
I'm fine.

53:41.040 --> 53:42.570
You make ready.

53:42.750 --> 53:44.870
Okay, you ready, Dr. Sims?

53:45.010 --> 53:48.880
Oh, shit.
Look what the cat dragged in.

53:49.090 --> 53:51.440
- Oh, good. You're here.
- Mr. Cutts.

53:51.450 --> 53:54.610
I just lost my top scientist
at the Meltwater Hot Springs.

53:54.620 --> 53:57.780
You just got in over your head
and had to punt, huh?

53:57.790 --> 54:00.190
Your experiment's run amok.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.450
My experiment?

54:01.460 --> 54:04.720
What, you think I'm actually
controlling these...

54:04.730 --> 54:08.560
Yeah, but of course you would.
Your psych eval suggested as much.

54:08.570 --> 54:10.000
You had me profiled?

54:10.010 --> 54:13.900
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this is not the Island of Dr. Moreau.

54:13.910 --> 54:17.040
I'm not some kind of walking
ethical dumpster fire.

54:17.050 --> 54:19.270
My mission here
is more elevated than that.

54:19.280 --> 54:23.810
Oh, yes. No DARPA skunk
works in the hopper, huh?

54:23.820 --> 54:29.180
No bio-engineering perhaps?
A little Graboid gene-splicing?

54:29.190 --> 54:32.630
You know, that's a good idea,
but bio-weapons are not my thing.

54:32.900 --> 54:34.590
I'm here with an engineering team

54:34.600 --> 54:36.620
to assess the purity
of the groundwater

54:36.630 --> 54:40.290
and to design an aquifer to move it out
of the Arctic and into civilization.

54:40.300 --> 54:41.930
This is about water?

54:41.940 --> 54:44.000
Water is the new oil,
and, as you may have noticed,

54:44.010 --> 54:46.370
the Arctic has it
in abundance now.

54:46.380 --> 54:48.230
It took just
one of those creatures

54:48.240 --> 54:50.740
