WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:06.210
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.400 --> 00:08.050
Mrs. Stern, I have
good reason to believe

00:08.200 --> 00:11.010
that Simon's been skimming
from the clubs, hiding assets.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.200
If there's proof,
I can destroy him in this divorce.

00:13.356 --> 00:15.040
- You said you had documentation?
- I will.

00:15.196 --> 00:18.322
I'm gonna leave town with the kids.
I want you to come with us.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.802
Lobos's dispute with the Jimenez
Cartel in Mexico has turned deadly.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.570
New York is not safe anymore.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.485
I can put Nomar's killer in jail
if you help me.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.449
So you arrested Tommy?

00:28.600 --> 00:30.560
He was standing
in a hotel room with Felipe Lobos.

00:30.585 --> 00:31.965
You got Lobos, too?

00:32.119 --> 00:34.009
It is your belief
that the completed sketch

00:34.160 --> 00:36.003
was withheld in order
to deceive the court?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.969
We request you dismiss
with prejudice.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.566
I agree.
Mr. Egan, you're free to go.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.688
You stole that sketch
from my apartment.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.569
We've both been
playing dirty, Angie.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.802
He played me just like you said.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.042
Tell me everything you've got
on James St. Patrick.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.804
We're gonna take him down.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.645
Ghost being dead
is something we all want.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.680
With all y'all behind me, we'll put
Ghost and Tommy out the game forever.

00:56.705 --> 00:58.489
What Kanan's
asking you to do, Shawn,

00:58.640 --> 01:01.530
no real father should ever ask
of their son.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.640
I knew you couldn't kill Ghost
'cause you're weak.

01:03.665 --> 01:05.667
- Dad!
- You don't deserve to be my son.

Mike, wait.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.568
I don't have time
for the apology, Angela.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.371
You'll have a formal hearing
about the Egan sketch in a few days.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.760
Maybe you should think
about the private sector.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.042
It's about the Egan case.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.207
There is something
I should have said weeks ago.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.283
I think I'd better tell you now.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.007
Cashier's check?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.686
It's a nice touch,

05:35.840 --> 05:38.764
but I think you should
put me on retainer.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.686
Tommy's out free and clear,
till they catch him reoffending.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.207
But the Feds,
they still want to nail Lobos,

05:45.400 --> 05:47.240
which means you're still
vulnerable to charges.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.569
And your girlfriend,
the prosecutor...

05:50.720 --> 05:52.484
Angela.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.926
We blew her up in court.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.920
I doubt she's gonna have that job
much longer.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.567
And if I were her, I'd want to nail you
on my way out the door.

05:59.720 --> 06:03.327
Name you as a witness at least,
but probably as a defendant.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.563
Angela wouldn't do that.
I've considered all the angles.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.364
I'm going legit.
Trust me, I'm good.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.682
You're right. You are good.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.760
But you don't have eyes
in the back of your head.

06:12.785 --> 06:14.926
You want out?
You want to walk away? Clean?

06:15.080 --> 06:17.845
You gotta cut ties with everybody
who knows who you are.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.082
Including you?

06:20.240 --> 06:22.083
If I need you, I'll call you.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.481
But don't wait up.
I've got everything under control.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.851
What? Tommy! Damn!

06:45.000 --> 06:48.049
I'm gonna have to get the kids
out here before there's nothing left.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.009
Look, I had enough
of the government's

06:50.160 --> 06:52.527
fuckin' "nutrition loaf"
to last me a lifetime.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.291
I thought I was never
gonna get one of these again.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.170
You know,
Ghost said he had a plan,

07:02.320 --> 07:04.607
but for a minute I wasn't so sure.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.330
Yeah, me either.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.245
I mean, I get arrested
and he don't?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.482
It's hard not to think
that that's fucked up.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.690
But you should have seen
the look on Angela's face

07:15.840 --> 07:18.320
when my lawyer
pulled out that sketch.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.245
Oh, yeah, Ghost played her
like checkers.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.880
She never saw it coming.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.646
Ghost put our family first, T.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.842
He and Angela are over.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.162
Maybe things can go back
to the way they were, you know?

07:34.320 --> 07:37.210
Before all this shit.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.006
Tommy, can you go
get the kids up?

07:43.160 --> 07:45.128
Tell them we're gonna be late.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.003
- Sure.
- All right, thank you.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.969
But I'm gonna need
some more bacon.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.361
You know what? Get outta here.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.845
Riq, Raina. Where you at?

07:59.040 --> 08:00.201
Riq?

08:06.680 --> 08:09.809
Shawn, where are you?
It's almost 8:00.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.567
The kids have to be in the car
for school in a few minutes.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.481
If you're not gonna make it,
let me know.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.723
Hey, girl.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.848
Hey, Shawn
didn't come home last night.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.287
He's not answering his phone,
so I thought I'd call you.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.602
- I told you to look out for him.
- I heard from him last night.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.649
Said he had some business
driving Ghost.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.690
Look, you talk to Shawn again,
you tell him to call me, okay?

08:41.840 --> 08:46.323
I got you. I'll tell Shawn to call
his mom soon as he hits me up.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.482
That's some cold shit, K.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.600
What you think she gonna do when she
find out you the one that clipped him?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.125
She ain't gonna
find out shit, right?

08:54.280 --> 08:56.248
If you did your job right,
right?

08:56.400 --> 08:58.641
I did what you wanted me to do.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.848
Nobody's gonna find him, man.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.963
Good.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.726
You heard from anybody?

09:11.040 --> 09:14.249
Ruiz called and I didn't answer.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.528
Ghost ain't dead,
so what's there to talk about?

09:16.655 --> 09:19.135
Good, don't take none of their calls
till we got our next move.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.730
Now that Shawn done
fucked this shit up,

09:20.880 --> 09:22.325
Ghost know we'll be
coming for him.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.324
And he'll be ready,
so we need to be ready.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.528
Get the crew in here, strapped.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.727
Did I stutter, motherfucker?

09:41.960 --> 09:44.645
You missed Daddy
while I was gone, didn't you?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.960
You know what? If I'm Lobos,
I might be suspicious of you

09:49.000 --> 09:51.651
sitting here making out with your dog
while I'm on the inside.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.360
Got to keep our head
on a swivel, Tommy.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.160
No, what we gotta do
is make it crystal clear

09:55.310 --> 09:56.721
that I ain't said shit against him.

09:56.870 --> 09:58.603
Me getting out was a Fed fuck-up.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.162
All right. I'll call him,
let him know right away.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.482
Make sure he's still down
with us moving his weight.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.855
Then I need to call the primeras,
let them know we're back in business.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.962
So I'll hit Ruiz,
you get Serb and Drifty.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.088
Thanks. Cheers.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.004
Cheers.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.089
But we got
a bigger problem, Tommy.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.925
Shawn put a gun to my head
and tried to kill me last night.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.321
- Kanan's orders.
- Oh, bullshit.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.520
He's the one that hired the hitter,
got Cruz killed,

10:27.545 --> 10:28.970
- and shot Holly.
- That was Rolla.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.600
The hitter told me
with her dying breath it wasn't.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.410
I suspected Kanan.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.564
Wasn't until last night I was sure.
He thinks I'm the reason he went inside.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.001
Needed his time to be someone's fault,
so he made it mine.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.805
If that was true, why didn't he
just cap us when he got out?

10:41.960 --> 10:44.122
'Cause he wanted
the business back.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.362
He needed to learn
how it worked.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.251
What you taught him.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.051
All he needed was
an introduction to Lobos.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.884
Oh, shit!

10:54.040 --> 10:56.088
He asked to come
to the Lobos meet.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.891
- He wanted me to take him.
- Of course he did.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.520
With Lobos on the inside,
Kanan's got to find another connect

11:01.720 --> 11:04.371
and take us out.
It's his only play.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.042
Unless he still trusts you.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.885
Knox, come on in.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.884
Sorry I'm late, sir.
I was looking for Angela.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.368
We were supposed to meet with you
together to discuss James St. Patrick.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.522
Actually, Greg,
I already spoke to Angela.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.600
She came in early. I wonder if you
can back her up on some of the details.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.166
Come on, have a seat.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.369
When did Angela first have contact
with St. Patrick about the Egan case?

11:46.040 --> 11:48.008
Hey, Jerry.
What are you doing here?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.242
AUSA Sandoval asked me to join.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.528
Please, continue, Agent Knox.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.002
The night we interrogated
Holly Weaver,

11:56.160 --> 11:58.003
I saw them talking
at Angela's apartment.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.640
Why were you at her apartment?

12:00.800 --> 12:04.407
She seemed upset after
the Weaver thing went south, sir,

12:04.560 --> 12:06.767
and I went there to...

12:06.920 --> 12:09.127
see if she was okay.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.280
He may have seen the sketch
at her place that night

12:11.305 --> 12:12.604
and stolen it then.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.001
After Egan was released,
she was very upset.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.527
She went to St. Patrick's club
right from the office...

12:17.680 --> 12:19.880
How do you know Angela
went to Truth straight from here?

12:19.960 --> 12:22.281
Did you follow her?

12:23.760 --> 12:25.720
Mike, I know what it...
I know what it looks like,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.131
but I was trying to protect her.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.960
If you thought she was in danger,
you could've assigned her a detail

12:30.000 --> 12:31.286
through proper channels.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.761
You had a sexual relationship.
She broke things off,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.526
you couldn't take no
for an answer.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.721
If that's what she told you,
then there's only one reason

12:49.880 --> 12:52.360
that she would lie.
She must be working with St. Patrick.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.171
She's discrediting me
to cover for him

12:55.320 --> 12:57.601
because I told her that we need
to pursue him as a suspect

12:57.626 --> 13:01.371
because I think that James St. Patrick
is the real Ghost.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.046
If Valdes is working
with Egan and St. Patrick,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.120
then why the hell would she
have led us to Lobos?

13:06.200 --> 13:08.885
I had the wrong address.
She had the right one.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.202
- She got us a collar.
- Yes.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.575
Is there hard evidence against
St. Patrick, or just your suspicions?

13:13.600 --> 13:15.284
There's no...
No, there's no evidence yet,

13:15.480 --> 13:17.800
- but we're making some headway.
- He was in her apartment.

13:17.825 --> 13:20.568
No wonder you want
to put the cuffs on him.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.041
St. Patrick took advantage
of Angela.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.330
She made mistakes,
but she wasn't aiding and abetting.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.766
I don't know
what you were doing.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.083
She's filed a formal
harassment complaint, Greg.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.481
You're suspended,
effective immediately.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.449
I'm gonna need your gun
and your badge.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.887
Fuck. Looks like they knew
where the cameras were.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.520
- No fuckin' faces.
- Faces wouldn't help.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.603
Cops never catch
these kinds of people anyway.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.484
And they got
all the cash on hand.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.091
We were doing such good business

13:51.240 --> 13:52.960
that we didn't have time
to make a bank run.

13:52.985 --> 13:56.003
'Course, and insurance
doesn't cover cash.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.243
- Anything else missing?
- Ledgers, paperwork.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.966
But the numbers will be
in the system, right, Kantos?

14:02.120 --> 14:04.691
Actually, I didn't get a chance to upload

14:04.840 --> 14:06.880
the latest figures
from the ledgers into the system.

14:06.905 --> 14:08.683
What a shame.
Without those ledgers,

14:08.840 --> 14:10.524
how will I know if you reach

14:10.680 --> 14:13.524
the 20% necessary
for you to buy back Truth?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.569
We both know I hit the mark.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.963
Without that paperwork,
we don't know anything.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.647
Let's look on the bright side, James.
We get to keep working together.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.161
Isn't that a treat?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.724
Yo!

14:57.880 --> 15:00.087
I'm freezin' my balls off
out here! Let's go!

15:05.720 --> 15:09.008
Yo, yo, yo.
What the fuck's up, Dre?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.922
What's up, K? I miss somethin'?

15:18.080 --> 15:20.208
Can't trust any nigga
who gets sprung that fast.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.045
- I ain't no snitch, motherfucker.
- Why you here?

15:23.200 --> 15:25.931
I'm here because
fuckin' Ghost set me up.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.362
I'm in a hotel room with fuckin' Lobos
and a bag full of dough.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.364
Next minute, I'm doin' a fuckin'
perp walk, no Ghost in sight.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.880
I'm at my pretrial shit,
my lawyer's like, "Blah blah blah",

15:37.000 --> 15:38.161
evidence is wrong."

15:38.320 --> 15:40.520
Judge says they gotta let me go,
so I come straight here

15:40.640 --> 15:42.961
because I know it's fuckin' Ghost
that dimed me out.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.928
Ghost did that same shit to me.
Set me up.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.400
Put me in 10 years so he could
run the hustle his way.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.600
Yeah, but Ghost wasn't there
the night you got popped.

15:56.625 --> 15:59.728
Ghost took the bulb out the taillight
so I get pulled over with the weight.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.804
The anonymous tip
came from a woman... Tasha.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.442
Tasha? Really?

16:06.600 --> 16:08.204
Why didn't you tell me, man?

16:08.400 --> 16:12.450
I thought you might've been in on it.
I know you ain't now.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.127
Lobos is still in lockup, but that
ain't gonna stop him from movin' weight.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.240
Now, I can't run
with that motherfucker by myself.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.130
- I need you, K.
- No doubt.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.487
And now that I know
how Ghost treats his friends,

16:23.640 --> 16:25.688
I'm thinkin' it might be better
to be his enemy

16:25.840 --> 16:29.128
while he's still walkin' around.
You know what I mean?

16:30.160 --> 16:33.323
Yeah, motherfucker fallen off, man.
I shoulda known.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.320
Couldn't even take care
of that bitch in Miami.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.205
- I mean, a bitch.
- He didn't kill that girl in Miami?

16:38.360 --> 16:41.603
Seems like this motherfucker
been lyin' to you for a long time.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.969
I wonder what else you don't know.
Come on, let's head to the back,

16:45.120 --> 16:46.929
talk about how
we gonna step to Lobos.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.243
- Hey, Ghost still think you trust him.
- Yep.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.007
I think I just figured out how
we gonna lay this motherfucker down.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.521
Tommy came over
for breakfast this morning.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.128
You got him out...

17:11.280 --> 17:13.407
just like you said you would.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.324
That's the Ghost I used to know.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.608
Now you know
why I needed Angela alive.

17:24.520 --> 17:29.082
You were right, T, to tell me
to stay with her until I had a plan.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.646
Tommy told me what you
did to her to get him out.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.121
Said she could lose her job.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.002
So is it over...

17:43.560 --> 17:45.642
between you two?

17:50.080 --> 17:52.447
Is it over between you
and Shawn?

17:53.520 --> 17:55.887
Yeah, I knew.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.850
He told me himself
when he came last night...

17:59.000 --> 18:00.968
- To kill me.
- What?

18:01.120 --> 18:03.440
Kanan put the gun in his hand,
but you know the real reason

18:03.465 --> 18:05.889
he wanted me out of the way, right?

18:06.040 --> 18:09.328
I used Angela
to protect our family.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.251
You fuckin' that kid
could've destroyed it.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.762
What would you and the kids do
if Shawn had pulled that trigger?

18:15.920 --> 18:19.049
What did you do to him, Ghost?

18:19.240 --> 18:21.242
I told him to leave New York
and never come back.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.200
So you just let him walk away,
just like that?

18:23.225 --> 18:25.227
I don't blame him!

18:26.840 --> 18:29.161
I blame you. You and Kanan.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.161
And, T...?

18:41.320 --> 18:44.483
I'm sure you'll hear from Shawn
soon as he's set up.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.880
But you know then you got
an important decision to make.

18:46.905 --> 18:49.011
I mean, you can stay here
with the kids

18:49.160 --> 18:53.051
or you can go live off the salary
of a high school basketball coach.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.090
Fuck you, Ghost.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.169
You need to look around.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.488
There's no winners here.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.405
Just me and you, baby.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.722
Both of us.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.167
Alone.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.762
The DOJ would love
to spare the taxpayers

20:12.920 --> 20:14.968
the expense of a trial.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.202
If you're willing to take a deal,

20:17.400 --> 20:20.324
we can make certain...
considerations.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.531
Protective custody, for example.

20:26.720 --> 20:30.202
Your client doesn't speak English now?

20:30.360 --> 20:32.283
He went to Wharton
Business School.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.489
Qué?

20:47.960 --> 20:49.644
Wendrif Menkins...

20:52.360 --> 20:55.045
Vladimir Jankovic...

22:06.320 --> 22:09.608
Can I go back to my cell now?

22:11.680 --> 22:13.648
Told Kanan
I was down to kill you.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.802
He definitely thinks
you set him up.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.566
- He said Tasha was in on it, too.
- He's out of his goddamn mind.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.042
You know,
prison does that to you.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.647
- Friends turn into enemies.
- No doubt.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.608
Funny thing is,

22:29.760 --> 22:32.161
he said you didn't kill
that bitch down in Miami.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.286
Someone else did.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.329
It's true.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.244
I got to her a second
after she was stabbed.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.641
I talked to her, but, no,
I didn't get the kill.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.481
- So you lied to my face.
- Tommy, I wanted to tell you,

22:48.640 --> 22:50.529
but you were so deep
under Kanan's sway.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.088
I ain't never given you a reason
not to trust me, Ghost.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.322
Except that one time.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.280
You know, the one
where you forgot to mention

22:58.305 --> 23:00.956
that Holly talked to the Feds?

23:02.440 --> 23:04.320
You had your reasons,
Tommy, for not telling me.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.290
Don't make it
any less true, right?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.442
Right?

23:10.800 --> 23:13.280
Well, now you know everything.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.602
Do I?

23:16.760 --> 23:18.922
Is there anything else
that I need to know?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.723
Tommy, I burned Angela
to get you out of jail.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.605
What else I gotta do
to prove my loyalty to you?

23:25.760 --> 23:29.287
You know what she meant to me.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.569
It's you and me, Tommy,
just like it's always been.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.125
I'll get Kanan to the spot.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.690
After our last conversation,
my client generously agreed

23:50.840 --> 23:52.808
to raise our settlement offer
half a percent.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.960
- You're joking.
- I recommended a quarter percent,

23:55.040 --> 23:58.522
- but Mr. Stern insisted.
- Baby, I just want you to be happy.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.728
Happy? Without
the Park Avenue apartment

24:00.880 --> 24:03.247
or the house in Long Island
or the house in Florida?

24:03.400 --> 24:05.323
Have you thought about Hoboken?

24:05.480 --> 24:07.369
I've thought
about a lot of things,

24:07.520 --> 24:09.320
mainly how you would look
in a prison uniform.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.920
- Prison?
- Embezzlement.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.606
It's only Club Fed, but they still
make you wear the jumpsuit.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.200
I'm sure you know that my husband
has hidden assets offshore.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.571
I'm sure you helped him do it.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.802
But you know where
those assets came from?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.201
Embezzling money
from his own clubs.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.001
Two sets of books, two sets
of cost reports, two sets of everything.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.003
We found Ravenna Holdings,
Mr. Stern.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.969
Simon, don't admit to anything...

24:31.120 --> 24:34.283
If she wanted me in jail,
she'd have gone to the Feds already.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.488
What do you want, Madeline?

24:39.240 --> 24:42.289
Bravo, James.
The robbery was a ruse

24:42.440 --> 24:44.283
just so you could get
your hands on the books.

24:44.440 --> 24:48.047
- Kantos told you, I take it?
- He didn't have to. I can add.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.000
I brought the club to 20% profit, Simon.
But the numbers didn't show it

24:52.160 --> 24:55.004
because you were hiding something.
All I had to do was find proof.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.481
And give it to Madeline
so she could ruin me.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.126
You won't enjoy
working for her, James.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.363
- She's a tremendous bitch.
- So are you, darling.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.528
You have the papers
for me to sign, James?

25:05.680 --> 25:09.446
Let me guess.
You bought Truth back from her.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.969
And Verbatim and Syrup.
See, I think it's time for me to expand.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.282
- Take care of yourself, James.
- You, too.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.011
It was a pleasure
doing business with you both.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.528
- This isn't over, James.
- Yes, Simon, it is.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.650
But you were right about one thing.
Because of you,

25:27.800 --> 25:31.407
I'm now exactly the man
I always wanted to be.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.727
Angie!

25:43.720 --> 25:46.326
Angela. Angie.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.329
Go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.409
Look, look. Stop, stop, Angie.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.291
I made a deal with Madeline Stern
to beat Simon,

25:53.440 --> 25:55.681
get Truth back
plus two more clubs.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.649
- Fully legit.
- So you're totally clean?

25:57.800 --> 26:01.122
- I will be.
- God.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.641
What I'm saying is
everything that I said

26:05.800 --> 26:08.690
would happen is gonna come true.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.922
Everything you ever
told me was a lie.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.923
The problem is
it was a really good lie.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.128
I could've burned you yesterday.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.886
But I thought about you
losing your kids.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.647
I thought about you,
so I didn't do it.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.610
I hurt someone else instead.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.889
He deserved better from me,
I deserve better from you.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.567
You still love me, Angie.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.883
My career is over
because of you!

26:38.040 --> 26:40.202
Just like you worked
to get those clubs,

26:40.360 --> 26:43.045
I worked to get where I am...
Where I was.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.687
I know this never occurred to you,
but it's not just me.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.650
It's my father in the home.
It's my nephew in college.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.565
It's my sister.
My family depends on me.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.008
And when Isabel Ruiz gives her
statement at my bar hearing tomorrow,

26:56.160 --> 26:59.004
everything I worked for
goes down the drain.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.003
But congratulations
to you, Jamie.

27:01.160 --> 27:04.050
Looks like you got
everything you wanted.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.851
Now go away and leave me alone.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.163
Can you do that one thing for me?
Can you leave me the fuck alone?

27:10.320 --> 27:11.970
Thank you.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.007
Goodbye, Ghost.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.124
Okay, we all good.

27:25.280 --> 27:28.124
I talked to Lobos
and he wants to deal.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.523
Nah, Ghost don't suspect
a fuckin' thing.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.762
Hey, I'll talk to you later.
I gotta go.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.530
Bell!

27:35.680 --> 27:37.409
Hi.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.407
- Tommy.
- I'll give you a head start.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.086
'Cause when I catch you,
it ain't gonna be good.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.686
Ghost sent me away.
I didn't want to leave you.

27:49.840 --> 27:53.526
- He made me go.
- You better step your lying,

27:53.680 --> 27:56.445
gold digging, snitching ass off

27:56.600 --> 27:58.921
or I will choke you out
in front of God and everybody.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.889
Look in the bag.

28:01.040 --> 28:04.806
I can prove I'm telling
the truth about Ghost.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.167
Ask him about "Monica Moore."

28:10.640 --> 28:12.768
I love you, Tommy.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.801
Bell, let's go.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.402
Wait here.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.087
Welcome to Truth.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.811
Your boy already wanded me, man.
I ain't packin'.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.322
Are you just gonna
shoot me right here, man?

29:52.120 --> 29:55.408
I'm not here to kill you, man.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.489
That was you in Miami,
wasn't it?

29:57.640 --> 30:00.962
In the alleyway.
Got to the girl before I did.

30:01.120 --> 30:04.010
I killed her
because Kanan told me to.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.128
But I'm not taking orders
from him no more, man.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.800
- He's fucked up in the head.
- Tell me something I don't know.

30:08.825 --> 30:11.843
Shawn came to see you
the other night.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.050
And after you sent him away,
he came to the shack.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.846
Kanan shot him.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.049
He told me to dump the body
so nobody could find it.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.129
- Fuck...!
- That was it for me, man.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.203
Ghost, you know
I'm a father, man.

30:31.360 --> 30:34.160
If he could do that to his own son,
what you think he's gonna do to me?

30:34.185 --> 30:36.865
It's exactly the same thing
I should do to you for workin' with him.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.886
You wanna work with me?

30:55.120 --> 30:57.600
What more I gotta prove, man?

31:12.280 --> 31:14.681
He bought it.
Ghost thinks I'm on his side now.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.649
What about Tommy?

31:16.800 --> 31:18.882
Motherfucker don't
suspect a thing, man.

31:19.040 --> 31:23.170
Ghost think he got that white boy
in pocket like he always does.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.368
Good. Tommy'll bring him
to the spot.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.966
We'll take him out just like they did
Breeze back in the day.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.522
You'll get rid of the body.
We'll have the whole crew meet,

31:31.680 --> 31:33.603
tell 'em how everything
gonna roll with Lobos.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.444
So I ain't comin' to the meeting?

31:35.600 --> 31:37.360
Sure, we'll still be there
when you get back.

31:40.040 --> 31:43.647
I need you to reach out
to the Serb, Ruiz, and Drifty,

31:43.800 --> 31:47.009
and explain to 'em
Tommy on our side now.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.686
Ghost did him
just like he did me.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.960
Greedy motherfucker
don't know how to treat a friend.

31:59.240 --> 32:03.723
This shit is good.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.130
Vibora.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.489
Ghost?

32:41.600 --> 32:43.762
- You heard Tommy got knocked?
- I heard he got out.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.843
But Lobos is still inside.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.083
Since Tommy didn't spill, the Feds
will need a witness against him.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.810
So, I've done the math.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.851
Lobos' best play is to eliminate
anyone who can talk.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.843
Ruiz, the others
have only heard his name,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.129
but you and I,
we've seen his face.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.005
You want me to leave New York?

33:05.160 --> 33:07.288
Not just us, our families, too.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.681
Lobos goes scorched earth.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.043
I'm telling you, I need you
to go into hiding so that nobody,

33:13.200 --> 33:16.090
especially Lobos,
will ever find you.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.685
Food's here.

33:52.640 --> 33:56.440
The defendant, Angela Valdes,
is charged with the violation

33:56.600 --> 33:58.967
of New York State
Unified Court System's

33:59.120 --> 34:03.091
rule of professional
conduct 4.4A...

34:03.240 --> 34:06.722
obtaining evidence that violates
the rights of a third party,

34:06.880 --> 34:11.168
in this case,
a minor, Isabel Ruiz.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.328
The New York State Bar
is also seeking

34:13.480 --> 34:15.562
grounds for disbarment.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.690
At minimum,
a censure against Ms. Valdes

34:18.840 --> 34:20.569
on her permanent record.

34:20.719 --> 34:26.204
I have reviewed all the exhibits
submitted into evidence

34:26.360 --> 34:29.443
and I'm inclined to hear
the testimony of the witness,

34:29.600 --> 34:33.924
Miss Isabel Ruiz, before hearing
any other arguments from counsel.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.367
There has been a...

34:43.520 --> 34:46.170
A change in the availability

34:46.320 --> 34:48.607
of the witnesses, Your Honor.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.967
Miss Ruiz did not appear
this morning

34:51.120 --> 34:54.886
and calls to her home
have not been returned.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.530
- You've reached...
- Isabel.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.288
I'm sorry, the inbox
you are trying to reach is full.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.768
Isabel Ruiz
didn't show up, did she?

35:11.960 --> 35:13.086
How do you know that?

35:13.240 --> 35:16.050
You got off scot-free.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.531
What's going on?

35:17.680 --> 35:20.206
Right, you were suspended...

35:20.360 --> 35:22.408
so temporarily.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.608
Lobos was stabbed
in his cell this morning.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.809
Most of his network's been
eliminated in the past 36 hours.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.611
Ruiz and his whole family
boarded a plane to California.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.560
We lost track of them after they landed.
They could be anywhere by now.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.170
Any other bodies? Egan?

35:40.360 --> 35:43.284
No, just Drifty,
Vladimir, and Lobos,

35:43.440 --> 35:45.647
each with a spider
Loteria card left nearby.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.122
The Jimenez. Looks like
they finally caught up to Lobos.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.282
Looks like it.
He's in surgery right now.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.522
Is he gonna make it?

35:53.680 --> 35:55.887
It's anybody's guess.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.443
Pick up. Come on, pick up.

36:16.600 --> 36:20.889
You've reached 347-555-0156.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.451
Please leave a message.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.762
Jamie, call me back.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.642
Yo, Tommy.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.562
Tommy?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.526
Can't get out that way, Kanan.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.406
I said it myself...
Tight like a pair of balls.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.567
Where Tommy? He got a gun, too?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.563
He ain't here.

37:03.720 --> 37:06.610
That wasn't part of the plan, was it?
Why he ain't show?

37:10.600 --> 37:13.490
This how it's gonna go?
You just gonna shoot me unarmed,

37:13.640 --> 37:15.290
like a little bitch?

37:24.240 --> 37:26.527
"Unarmed"?
What the fuck is this?

37:26.720 --> 37:28.400
This the gun you used
to kill your own son?

37:28.425 --> 37:32.225
He wasn't my son no more.
He was your son.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.121
Put the fuckin' wrench down.

38:55.240 --> 38:59.040
I'll do you just like you did Rolla.
Only you deserve it.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.363
10 years locked up, I thought about
killing you a hundred different ways.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.603
Put a gun in your mouth and watch
your brains hit the walls in your club.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.330
I made you watch me fuck Tasha.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.609
I pushed you off the roof
of your bougie-ass crib.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.649
I seen you dead so many times,

39:23.800 --> 39:26.849
I was worried I wouldn't enjoy it
when I finally got my chance.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.331
Boy, was I wrong.

39:28.480 --> 39:31.723
This is even better
than I thought.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.526
You always talked
too fuckin' much.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.483
Kanan's dead?
Yeah, I figured it'd shake out that way.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.560
- I gave you the drop.
- Where the fuck were you?

41:10.585 --> 41:12.553
I could've been killed.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.282
I was hangin' out with her.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.890
- You can't trust her.
- No, I can't trust you.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.288
You paid her to leave.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.010
She's trouble, man.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.925
Just like Kanan was "trouble"
back in the day?

41:30.080 --> 41:33.163
Like I was "trouble"
when I wouldn't help you kill Lobos?

41:33.320 --> 41:35.163
You think I'm fuckin' stupid,
don't you?

41:35.320 --> 41:38.449
- Just like Kanan did.
- I don't think you're fuckin' stupid.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.449
You know what?
Maybe I am fuckin' stupid.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.371
Because I thought this was
some sort of midlife crisis shit...

41:43.560 --> 41:46.245
Fuck your bitch from high school,
play "what if," and move on.

41:46.440 --> 41:49.410
And I thought when you got me
out of jail and burned Angela

41:49.560 --> 41:52.928
that you were still the same old Ghost
underneath all the bullshit...

41:53.080 --> 41:55.367
My brother.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.961
But my brother's gone.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.209
So I'm gonna do your lyin' ass
a favor and take over.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.328
I'ma distribute for Lobos
from now on

42:06.480 --> 42:08.289
with Ruiz, the Serb, and Drift,

42:08.440 --> 42:11.240
and leave you to your precious
party planning, all right, motherfucker?

42:11.354 --> 42:13.114
- Tommy, come...
- No, I'm gonna buy you out.

42:13.139 --> 42:16.844
Just do me one favor and stay
the fuck outta my business.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.207
There is no more business.

42:20.760 --> 42:24.446
The fuck does that mean?

42:27.160 --> 42:28.969
They all knew our names, Tommy.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.444
They knew our faces.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.523
Keeping them alive
was too risky.

42:39.480 --> 42:43.121
The only way out
was to cut all ties.

42:45.720 --> 42:47.768
Ain't nobody left.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.486
So when I was hittin' them up
and they was writin' back,

42:52.640 --> 42:55.928
that was you... trickin' me?

42:56.080 --> 42:58.401
So you could kill them
without telling me first?

43:02.920 --> 43:04.809
They were disloyal to us, Tommy.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.725
All of 'em.
They all deserved to die.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.325
They was trouble?

43:12.520 --> 43:14.488
So, what, Ghost? Am I next?

43:14.640 --> 43:17.041
- Tommy, don't do this.
- You got everything you wanted.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.407
- What about what I want?
- We got a business.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.289
We got a legitimate
fuckin' business.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.681
One more time
with that fucking shit.

43:23.840 --> 43:27.208
That's your business.
This is my business.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.880
It's the only thing
I was ever good at.

43:28.905 --> 43:30.907
Fuck that. You're great at it.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.526
- But I got more to offer.
- You motherfucker.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.081
No matter how much
your suits cost

43:38.240 --> 43:39.844
or how many clubs you ever own,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.128
you just a ghetto-ass corner boy
from around the way

43:42.280 --> 43:43.964
with a drunk for a daddy
and no mama.

43:44.120 --> 43:47.090
- Motherfucker.
- You ain't changed at all.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.922
So do it, motherfucker.

43:53.080 --> 43:56.721
Go on, do it.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.928
Prove to me that you
ain't nothin' but a thug.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.890
Go on, do it!

44:03.040 --> 44:05.486
Put the gun down.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.930
You already
got yourself a new bitch?

44:09.120 --> 44:11.361
Now.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.162
You think you traded up, kid?

44:15.320 --> 44:19.291
Word of advice...
Watch your back.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.331
Have a nice life, motherfucker.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.167
What the hell happened to you?

45:08.160 --> 45:10.401
It was a long night, Angela.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.728
How was your hearing?

45:12.880 --> 45:14.769
Isabel Ruiz didn't show up.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.685
But I think you know that.

45:19.480 --> 45:22.404
I came to tell you Lobos'
whole New York syndicate

45:22.560 --> 45:24.927
is dead or missing, but...

45:25.080 --> 45:27.048
I think you might
know that, too.

45:28.520 --> 45:32.764
- I heard.
- How did you survive this, Jamie?

45:32.920 --> 45:35.082
Why are you the only one left?

45:42.640 --> 45:45.530
If I accept what you are
and I love you anyway,

45:45.720 --> 45:47.404
what does that make me?

45:49.800 --> 45:53.521
If I care about all of the things
you've done to get here,

45:53.680 --> 45:56.604
I should walk out of here
right now and never come back.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.240
You know what you should do?

45:59.440 --> 46:02.444
You should call the Bar Committee
and accept the censure, too.

46:02.600 --> 46:06.650
I should call my boss, make
a full confession, put you in cuffs.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.804
But when I thought
you were dead, I...

46:09.960 --> 46:13.601
I didn't... I couldn't care
about any of that.

46:13.760 --> 46:16.331
I can't get over you,

46:16.480 --> 46:20.166
but I can't be with you, either.
I can't be with Ghost.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.322
Angela, there is no more Ghost.

46:24.280 --> 46:27.523
- Ghost is dead.
- Forever?

46:27.720 --> 46:30.803
After tonight,
Ghost is gone for good.

46:30.960 --> 46:34.601
But James St. Patrick is real,
standing right in front of you.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.969
And very much in love with you.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.724
I'm right here.

46:46.800 --> 46:49.849
I have my kids,
I have the clubs,

46:50.000 --> 46:53.641
and everything we ever wanted
can happen now.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.482
And if I walk away now,
I'm just gonna be standing back here

47:05.640 --> 47:08.405
a week from now,
a month, a year.

47:13.960 --> 47:18.124
If, from this point forward,

47:18.280 --> 47:21.602
you can be everything
you said you would be...

47:24.440 --> 47:27.046
I can't promise
I can forget everything, Jamie,

47:27.200 --> 47:30.283
but I can try.

47:42.320 --> 47:45.244
Girl, I still can't believe
that Shawn didn't say goodbye.

47:45.400 --> 47:47.050
It's just not like him.

47:47.200 --> 47:50.090
I mean, if he was in trouble,
he could've just come to me.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.368
That's what we always
promised each other.

47:52.520 --> 47:55.888
Maybe he decided he wasn't ready
to be a daddy to three kids.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.361
I kinda understand
why he wouldn't say goodbye.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.961
You don't know that's the reason.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.043
This could be him now.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.645
