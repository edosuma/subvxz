WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:10.929
[crowd cheering]

00:11.136 --> 00:14.348
Thank you, Billy Crystal,
for that impression of a black person.

00:14.557 --> 00:17.727
-I'm Scott Wolf.
-And I'm Matthew Fox.

00:17.936 --> 00:19.854
We may be a group of five on TV,

00:19.938 --> 00:22.607
but any of these next nominees
would be welcome

00:22.690 --> 00:24.734
to join our party any day.

00:24.943 --> 00:26.444
-[microphone feedback]
-[man coughs]

00:26.527 --> 00:31.282
The nominees for Male Animal in
a Comedy, Drama or Variety Show are:

00:31.532 --> 00:34.201
BoJack Horseman,
Horsin' Around.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.455
Now that's what I call
horsin' around.

00:37.663 --> 00:38.706
[audience laughs and applauds]

00:38.790 --> 00:39.916
Uh... Yeah.

00:40.082 --> 00:43.377
Mr. Peanutbutter,
Mr. Peanutbutter's House.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.714
Now that's what I call
doggin' around.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.132
[audience laughs and applauds]

00:48.215 --> 00:49.467
[laughs]

00:49.675 --> 00:51.803
And finally, my personal favorite,

00:51.886 --> 00:55.389
Hank Hippopopalous,
Hank After Dark!

00:55.932 --> 00:58.726
Oh, boy, get it off, get it off.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.019
-[baby shrieks]
-[audience laughs and applauds]

01:00.645 --> 01:02.229
Hiya!

01:02.605 --> 01:04.607
And the animals' choice is...

01:04.774 --> 01:07.026
Hank Hippopopalous,
Hank After Dark!

01:07.109 --> 01:07.944
[Wolf howls]

01:08.027 --> 01:08.861
Oh, yeah.

01:09.028 --> 01:10.822
[camera shutters clicking]

01:11.030 --> 01:13.324
No, no, no, no.
It's because we're on a show

01:13.407 --> 01:16.118
called Party of Five. Get it?

01:16.368 --> 01:18.203
Hey, buddy,
pass me that bottle of vodka?

01:18.412 --> 01:21.373
-That's not really how this works.
-It's open bar, don't be a dick.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.751
-BoJack Horseman?
-Do I know you?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.795
This is my better half,
Katrina Peanutbutter.

01:26.004 --> 01:28.714
-Katrina, BoJack.
-I don't watch TV.

01:28.923 --> 01:32.010
Can I get another drink now or
will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?

01:32.092 --> 01:36.764
-Uh, uh, no, I would never be--
-Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

01:36.973 --> 01:38.683
My friends told me to get
a prenup,

01:38.891 --> 01:42.144
but I was like,
"Hey, marriage lasts forever."

01:42.353 --> 01:43.980
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.106
Can you believe two guys like us

01:46.315 --> 01:49.819
were even in the same category
as Hank Hippopopalous?

01:50.028 --> 01:51.236
[chuckles] That's Uncle Hanky.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.198
Listen, Peanutbottle,
there is no "guys like us."

01:54.406 --> 01:55.908
I'm BoJack Horseman.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.536
You're just some other guy
I'll probably never talk to again.

01:58.703 --> 02:02.206
Hey, boys.
What is this, a crossover episode?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.165
[all laugh]

02:03.374 --> 02:06.085
That is the funniest thing
I have ever heard.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.295
Uncle Hanky.
Sir, I am your biggest fan.

02:09.505 --> 02:12.299
I used to watch Hank Hippopopalous's
Dance-Pop Cosmopolis

02:12.508 --> 02:13.801
every day after school.

02:14.010 --> 02:16.888
-Hey, can I get a picture with you?
-Of course, kid.

02:17.096 --> 02:21.559
Here, let me advance this. [grunts]
And we probably got it.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.310
And we'll find out
in four to six weeks.

02:23.519 --> 02:24.645
Yeah, I can't wait.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.939
Okay, I gotta go.
My wife's hand just disappeared

02:27.147 --> 02:28.357
into that busboy's pants.

02:28.566 --> 02:31.694
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

02:31.903 --> 02:33.029
Hey, kid, listen.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.697
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

02:34.906 --> 02:37.658
I've seen your show. You're really funny.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.369
-Yeah?
-Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.121
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.207
That's just the way it is.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.959
Oh.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.461
This suit needs more flasks.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.884
[♪♪]

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:51.941 --> 03:53.109
-Diane!
-[passenger] Aah!

03:53.192 --> 03:57.404
Will you bring me one of those
big Toblerone bars? [chuckles]

03:57.613 --> 04:00.866
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't
be out there for another month.

04:01.075 --> 04:04.578
Yes, I know, but I always forget to
write these things down.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.538
Tell me, how's your little movie?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.834
Actually one of the stars just died.
It's really sad.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.377
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.047
Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.
Meanwhile, Diane,

04:15.255 --> 04:18.509
here in Cordovia, I'm stitching
children's arms back on.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.385
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

04:20.594 --> 04:24.015
Are you giving me a thumb's up
or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.100
Well, now the production's
on hiatus

04:26.308 --> 04:28.019
so BoJack and I
are going on a book tour

04:28.227 --> 04:30.980
to promote the new paperback edition
of One Trick Pony.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.523
Please get here soon, Diane.

04:32.731 --> 04:38.320
The people of Cordovia need you
and I need that Toblerone.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.072
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.700
You need to be on
your best behavior for this tour.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.327
Don't do that BoJack thing
where you go off-script

04:45.577 --> 04:47.163
and get a lot of people
mad at you.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.040
What? I don't do that.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.208
You're a movie star now.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.711
Any bad press you get
can hurt Secretariat.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.839
Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.799
Please. We're going to Alaska.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.760
How am I gonna offend a bunch
of inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.263
You're right. What was I thinking?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.515
The Republic of Cordovia's
Prince Gustav

05:06.598 --> 05:08.226
visiting Los Angeles this week

05:08.433 --> 05:11.395
while his country
rests on the brink of civil war.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.397
Prince Gustav
is a ruthless despot,

05:13.605 --> 05:16.441
but I'd still rather share a bed
with him than my ex-wife.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.777
Shannon, I didn't mean that.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.033
[dance music playing over speakers]

05:24.116 --> 05:26.451
Listen. With Hey, I Think You
Can Dance as a lead-in,

05:26.660 --> 05:29.163
we are expecting big things
for Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:

05:29.329 --> 05:31.707
What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?
Let's Find Out,

05:31.790 --> 05:36.670
or H.S.A.C.W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O.
for short.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.422
-Mm.
-[Wanda] Why don't we get Hank in here?

05:38.630 --> 05:40.299
You guys can get
some pictures together.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.926
Hank is coming here?

05:42.134 --> 05:44.303
That old guy from
Hey, I Think You Can Dance?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.847
-What's the big deal?
-You don't understand.

05:47.056 --> 05:50.017
When I was a kid,
this guy was the guy.

05:50.226 --> 05:53.771
I even bought his novelty rap album,
The Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.981
You shouldn't meet your hero
on an empty stomach.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.983
-Want me to go get you some chili?
-Good call.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.651
Chili is nature's chillaxative.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.321
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

06:02.529 --> 06:05.407
-Hank Hippopopalous.
-Oh, we've met.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.953
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.662
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

06:10.913 --> 06:12.331
you guys could stand back to back.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.333
And then on the billboard it'll say:

06:14.541 --> 06:19.546
"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are back
to back. Thursdays on MBN." [laughs]

06:19.755 --> 06:22.258
So, what should I do with my arms?
Like akimbo?

06:22.341 --> 06:23.508
-You're fine.
-Reverse akimbo?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.803
-No, that--
-King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.846
Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.681
-Can't stop windmilling now.
-Hey, hey.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.392
Why don't we just do
what feels natural?

06:32.601 --> 06:34.394
Guys like us? We're pros.

06:34.603 --> 06:35.729
"Guys like us"?

06:35.938 --> 06:37.522
You think I'm a guy like us?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.942
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my life.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.777
Excuse me,
would you get a picture of us?

06:41.986 --> 06:44.238
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.867
Now we open the floor to questions
from the audience.

06:49.076 --> 06:53.622
BoJack, your book talked a lot about
how much you love apple fritters.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.333
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.625
So, my question is:

06:56.708 --> 06:59.086
Do you think Israel
has a right to defend herself?

06:59.295 --> 07:00.921
-Uh...
-And what part should the U.S. play

07:01.005 --> 07:01.839
as an ally?

07:02.381 --> 07:03.382
[groans]

07:03.465 --> 07:05.509
Well, the thing about that...

07:05.717 --> 07:07.469
[both growl]

07:07.678 --> 07:11.098
Uh... It's a shame that Arafat
walked away from the table in 2000.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.809
I mean, obviously there's no panacea,
but a two-state solution

07:14.018 --> 07:16.854
with an emphasis on human rights
feels like a place to begin.

07:16.979 --> 07:17.813
[audience murmuring]

07:17.896 --> 07:20.524
-[Moose] Brilliant insight.
-[woman] Very good.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.818
-My question is for Diane Nyu-- Nyu--
-Oh.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.903
- Nyu--
-You won't get it. Ask the question.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.655
Your book went to some revealing places.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.449
Were you worried at all that it
would hurt BoJack or his career?

07:29.658 --> 07:30.826
That's a great question.

07:31.035 --> 07:33.204
I'd also like to know
the answer to that, Diane.

07:33.412 --> 07:37.124
Well, I think the truth
is worth pursuing, no matter what.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.501
BoJack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities

07:39.710 --> 07:42.921
who have done much worse things
and it hasn't hurt their careers.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.465
-Like who?
-I don't know, like Mike Tyson

07:45.674 --> 07:50.554
or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,
or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,

07:50.762 --> 07:53.391
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...

07:53.598 --> 07:55.934
Wait, wait, what about
Hank Hippopopalous?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.146
Well, all of his former assistants
have made the same allegations.

07:59.230 --> 08:01.565
-I feel like we're getting off track.
-Do you not know that?

08:01.732 --> 08:04.193
Any questions about me,
the handsome, famous horse with a book?

08:04.360 --> 08:05.944
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.072
I'm not saying anything
not on the public record.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.574
You can just Google
"Hank Hippopopalous allegations" and I--

08:10.782 --> 08:12.410
Oh, you don't have to
Google it right now.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.327
[all gasp]

08:13.411 --> 08:14.245
Dear God.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.457
Stanky Hanky?
Allegations vile and ranky.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.419
But first, the visiting
Cordovian Prince Gustav

08:21.626 --> 08:23.295
went missing briefly
this afternoon,

08:23.503 --> 08:26.798
but he was quickly found
buying chili in Beverly Hills.

08:27.007 --> 08:31.303
His official statement was,
"Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.472
Hooray, being a prince."

08:33.679 --> 08:36.640
Our main story,
ominous and anomalous accusations

08:36.850 --> 08:38.394
against Hank Hippopopalous.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.395
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

08:40.604 --> 08:42.940
and what does she have against
our beloved hippopotamus?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.983
Joining me now is
Hippopopalous apologist

08:45.192 --> 08:47.569
and armchair sociologist,
Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

08:47.778 --> 08:49.029
what are these allegations?

08:49.238 --> 08:52.074
These allegations are so crazy,
I can't even say them on TV

08:52.283 --> 08:53.951
or I'll sound like a crazy person.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.578
What I want to know
is why we're letting a national treasure

08:56.787 --> 08:59.831
face the same kind of smear tactics
used by the Viet Cong.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.833
Are you calling attention to the fact

09:01.917 --> 09:04.462
that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?

09:04.669 --> 09:07.005
I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.093
[Peanutbutter] You gotta see
this set they're building!

09:11.302 --> 09:12.803
There's a giant replica of my head,

09:13.011 --> 09:15.597
and every episode, the eyes
light up with dollar signs,

09:15.806 --> 09:18.850
confetti shoots out of the ears,
then I somersault out the mouth.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.103
We're bringing class
back to primetime.

09:21.312 --> 09:23.647
-Sounds amazing.
-And I'm really getting along

09:23.855 --> 09:25.023
with J.D. Salinger.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.319
-Did you know we both hate phonies?
-I did know that.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.613
So... listen.
Some website called "Tit Puncher"

09:31.822 --> 09:35.117
is saying you said some stuff
about Hank Hippopopalous.

09:35.326 --> 09:37.786
Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter,
I didn't mean for that to happen.

09:37.953 --> 09:40.872
Hey, do me a favor.
Please don't make a big thing out of this.

09:41.123 --> 09:44.001
It's really not a good time, you know,
with my show about to launch.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.296
-Hey, we are on the same page.
-Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?

09:47.505 --> 09:49.214
Because you should not read
the comments.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.049
Believe me,
nothing would make me happier

09:51.133 --> 09:52.968
than for this to just go away.

09:53.177 --> 09:56.096
-Great. I love you, too.
-[with heavy accent] Hello.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.140
-Oh, my God!
-Is chili you ask for.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.975
I am peasant boy Todd
from village.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.687
Friend of Peanut Man, and lover
of federated American states.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.857
No reason for suspicions.
[laughs] Come on!

10:07.065 --> 10:10.235
Wait a second, something's different.
[sniffs]

10:10.444 --> 10:13.030
I am... digging this new cologne!

10:13.238 --> 10:14.906
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.327
Is so great to be
in meager trash city Los Angeles

10:18.536 --> 10:21.079
with no pressures of royal life.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.416
What? Royal life?
Why I'm saying? I am no royal.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.043
[chuckles] Look at me. Normals.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.421
There's that classic
self-deprecating Todd wit.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.006
I'd know it anywhere.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.679
-We will now begin our Q and A.
-Fire when ready.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.932
What you got against Uncle Hanky,
you uppity cooze?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.560
Diane,
I believe this question is for you.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.644
If anyone here has any questions
about the book,

10:44.853 --> 10:46.104
I'd be happy to answer those.

10:46.355 --> 10:47.439
As would I, BoJack Horseman,

10:47.523 --> 10:49.858
Golden-Globe winning
star of the book.

10:50.067 --> 10:53.571
If Hank did anything wrong,
they wouldn't let him on TV, right?

10:53.778 --> 10:55.614
I'm really not here
to talk about that.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.533
You women are all the same.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.284
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, you make these

10:59.493 --> 11:01.370
broad accusations
to get attention for yourself,

11:01.579 --> 11:04.748
and when you don't have proof
to back it up, you just slink away.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.291
I'm not slinking away.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.252
I just wanted to say one thing
about me.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.505
I text and drive like all the time.
What?

11:11.713 --> 11:14.966
Isn't that what happened with all
those assistants? They took his money,

11:15.050 --> 11:17.677
and they don't even care
they could be ruining a man's life.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.305
What? They ruined his life?

11:20.514 --> 11:23.308
-You should probably just drop this.
-Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.436
They don't even know
how much I'm gonna drop it.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.979
The way you said that
made it sound like you won't drop it.

11:29.273 --> 11:30.982
How dare you spread
a narrative that--

11:31.066 --> 11:32.276
Don't tell me what to spread.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.446
I'll spread whatever I want.
It's called one of the amendments.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.656
Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.533
-This is completely--
-Yeah, hi.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.118
I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.121
I came with her. I gotta say
I'm opposed to child labor,

11:44.329 --> 11:46.706
like as a rule, but there
are some kinds of labor

11:46.915 --> 11:48.292
that children are just better at.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.043
You ever try to fit
into a mine shaft?

11:50.127 --> 11:52.963
That is a tight squeeze. What?

11:53.171 --> 11:55.382
Oh, man, probably gonna get
some letters about that, huh?

11:55.591 --> 11:57.050
I'm so incorrigible.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.553
Everyone's paying attention
to me now!

11:59.761 --> 12:01.346
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.641
Anyone else want a snack?

12:03.848 --> 12:07.227
No? That's a no?
On the snacks? Okay.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.187
What do you have against
Hank Hippopopalous?

12:09.354 --> 12:11.523
Everyone says
he's a really nice guy.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.483
Good point.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.652
That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice,

12:14.859 --> 12:17.028
people don't wanna think
he's capable of awful things

12:17.112 --> 12:18.405
so they let him off the hook.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.533
We don't know what happened.
It's a classic "he said, she said."

12:21.741 --> 12:25.162
"He said, they said."
It's eight different women.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.582
-Are they all lying?
-I mean, probably. We do that.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.750
At this point,
we just don't know enough to judge.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.378
Who are these women?
Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?

12:33.587 --> 12:34.630
Do they wear short shorts?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.007
Do they drink alcohol?
All these things are possible.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.676
We don't know the facts.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.302
See, this is part of the problem.

12:40.511 --> 12:41.886
You're supposed to be a journalist.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.264
You won't even tell your audience
what he's accused of.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.016
You're an expert.
Why don't you tell us?

12:46.183 --> 12:47.309
I'm not afraid to say it.

12:47.518 --> 12:50.103
Eight different women,
all former assistants,

12:50.312 --> 12:52.939
claim that Uncle Hanky
took them to a--

12:53.148 --> 12:54.358
What is Diane doing?

12:54.566 --> 12:57.444
I know. It's supposed to be my book tour
and she's upstaging me.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.154
Like how it was supposed
to be my book.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.031
Actually, this might be
a thing she does.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.074
She knows that Hippopopalous
is the only thing

13:03.158 --> 13:04.868
keeping my network afloat, right?

13:05.076 --> 13:07.120
The same network
that employs her husband.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.664
Why would she do this?

13:08.872 --> 13:10.666
Sometimes she just whips
herself into a frenzy

13:10.749 --> 13:13.544
and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?!

13:13.793 --> 13:16.588
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think
every time it gets invited to a party,

13:16.714 --> 13:18.465
it can bring along
its dumb friend honeydew?

13:18.674 --> 13:20.509
You don't get a plus-one,
cantaloupe!

13:20.718 --> 13:21.885
You need to talk to her.

13:22.761 --> 13:23.845
Huh.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.516
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit
on Contemporary Family.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.684
It's a disaster!

13:28.892 --> 13:30.561
-What?
-The kids have gone through puberty.

13:30.728 --> 13:32.896
They are rubbing themselves
on everything.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.691
If it isn't one thing, it's ano--
Just get a hose!

13:40.028 --> 13:45.283
Aha! I went to house to pick up mail
for you like real American Johnny.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.285
-Hey, man.
-Whoa!

13:47.494 --> 13:50.163
You know it's a federal crime to go
through someone else's mail?

13:50.372 --> 13:55.877
I do not know your customs,
for I am dirt-poor servant child.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.714
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.

13:58.922 --> 14:02.300
Death threat for wife, death threat
for wife, once more death threat,

14:02.509 --> 14:05.887
and here many monies off
for Bed Bath Beyond.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.182
Seems like great U.S.A. dream castle!

14:09.391 --> 14:11.059
Good Lord, that's graphic.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.977
How would she even fit
one of those in there?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.814
Some sort of funnel. Oh, I see,
there's actually an illustration.

14:16.064 --> 14:21.278
Excuse, Dog Dog Peanut Man?
This wife, she poke bear, yes?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.447
Yeah, I guess she kind of did.

14:23.655 --> 14:27.117
They have a saying where I am from,
which is here.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.119
Bear not like to be poke.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.622
-Bear get angry...
-Right.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.625
and destroy peasant rebel army

14:34.833 --> 14:39.504
with fist of fire of which make
many, many nightmares

14:39.755 --> 14:41.632
to children and men!

14:41.840 --> 14:45.385
Todd, I can always count on you
to give me the straight dope.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.345
Please don't ever change.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.639
[inaudible dialogue]

14:48.722 --> 14:49.598
[women gasp]

14:49.681 --> 14:52.892
Okay, just kill the whole feature.
Replace it with-- Oh, I don't know.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.519
What's Gwyneth doing for Purim?

14:54.728 --> 14:56.563
Diane? I want you
to meet Amanda Hannity,

14:56.772 --> 14:58.565
editor-in-chief
here at Manatee Fair.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.776
The pleasure's yours.
Walk with me, squawk with me.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.112
That woman can knock a drink back like
a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

15:04.195 --> 15:06.657
but damn if she doesn't
get shit done.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.908
No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.

15:09.117 --> 15:12.370
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you
an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.372
I would love
to take down Hippopopalous

15:14.581 --> 15:17.501
and finally topple the acropolis
of monstrous hypocrisy

15:17.584 --> 15:18.543
that ensconces us.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.546
Hey, wouldn't your readers
prefer something more relevant?

15:21.797 --> 15:24.924
Like, uh, what to do with all those
extra buttons that come with your shirts.

15:25.133 --> 15:29.387
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing
your weight behind this.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.348
-Oh, I didn't mean--
-That dress is hideous.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.057
Go home, burn it and come back.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.310
When we know what we know
about a monster like that

15:35.519 --> 15:36.978
and we still put him on TV
every week,

15:37.145 --> 15:39.147
we're teaching a generation
of young boys and girls

15:39.272 --> 15:41.024
that a man's reputation
is more important

15:41.232 --> 15:43.026
than the lives of the women
he's ruined.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.820
Yes, exactly!
I feel like I've been alone

15:45.028 --> 15:47.823
in a crazy alternate universe
these last few days.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.533
Well, you know I got your back,
right?

15:49.741 --> 15:52.536
We women have got to stick to--
Hey, fruit plate.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.539
No, people don't want articles
about that. People want life-hacks.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.624
Diane, you need to be strong.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.211
Everyone is gunning for you. You're
a woman talking out of turn about a man.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.840
We're not supposed to have opinions.
We're supposed to smile and look pretty.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.967
No, this model doesn't look as pretty
as the other one. Can we kill it?

16:08.176 --> 16:10.679
Scarves, not just for necks anymo--

16:10.888 --> 16:13.891
We need to sit you down with someone
who's willing to go on the record.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.935
I already reached out to all eight
of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.354
-What about his current assistant?
-You think she'd talk?

16:19.604 --> 16:21.606
I don't know. What do you think,
answering machine?

16:21.690 --> 16:22.524
[beeps]

16:22.733 --> 16:27.111
Hi, my name's Nicole.
I work for Mr. Hippopopalous and, um...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.239
I really need to talk to someone.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.490
[gasps]

16:30.699 --> 16:34.536
Are you kidding me?
With this honeydew right now? Ugh!

16:45.213 --> 16:46.548
-Nicole?
-Mm-hm.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.467
[car door opens]

16:49.551 --> 16:51.094
[Hank] Hello, Diane.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.347
Thank you, Nicole.

16:59.770 --> 17:03.106
Prince Gustav today startled
the international community

17:03.314 --> 17:06.025
when he gave his royal fortune
to charity.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.819
What? Oh, no!

17:08.027 --> 17:10.864
And fired his chief advisor,
who can be seen in this file photo

17:10.948 --> 17:12.574
looking vaguely suspicious.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.825
Oh, you idiot! No!

17:14.032 --> 17:16.035
Big reforms which could
lead to sweeping change

17:16.243 --> 17:20.080
in the embattled region,
or a precipitous economic collapse.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.666
[shouting in Cordovian]

17:22.876 --> 17:26.797
But back to our main story,
what is Diane's problem?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.509
I'll say it once, for your article.

17:31.718 --> 17:36.974
I didn't do any of those things
that you're accusing me of.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.142
I wanna be very clear.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.728
I'm not meeting you here
because I'm scared of you.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.354
This is me doing you a favor.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.065
-I think you are scared of me.
-I'm not a bad guy, Diane,

17:46.274 --> 17:47.734
and I truly do believe that.

17:47.943 --> 17:49.444
Twenty-four hours from now,

17:49.527 --> 17:52.447
the news cycle
will move on to something else.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.240
I'll go back to hosting my dance show,

17:54.449 --> 17:57.619
which employs hundreds
of nice, good, hardworking people.

17:57.828 --> 18:01.122
You, on the other hand,
are pretty much done.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.125
People love me and they're
not gonna forgive you for this.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.419
-This isn't about me.
-If you keep pushing this,

18:06.628 --> 18:09.213
you're gonna drag down
the people close to you.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.008
Look, you had your fun.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.302
So, why don't you call it a day
and go home to your husband?

18:14.511 --> 18:15.553
I know who you are.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.348
Sweetheart, everyone knows who I am.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.976
I'm Hank Hippopopalous.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.352
Who the hell are you?

18:30.902 --> 18:32.779
-So, you got nothing.
-I'm not giving up.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.405
There's gotta be someone
who will talk.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.450
Oh, listen. I had a conversation
with my bosses

18:37.617 --> 18:40.537
at AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-

18:40.620 --> 18:43.373
Toyota-Trader Joe's,
and we agreed

18:43.456 --> 18:46.292
these kind of stories,
they don't sell magazines.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.671
-Are you seriously killing this?
-It's just not a good time.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.715
So, this has nothing to do
with the fact

18:51.840 --> 18:53.132
that AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-

18:53.216 --> 18:57.054
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-
Trader Joe's also owns MBN,

18:57.220 --> 19:00.891
and is currently profiting off of
Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation?

19:01.058 --> 19:02.475
I know you're upset.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.685
Would you like a Joe-Joe?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.979
It's just like an Oreo,
but Trader Joe's style.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.898
No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

19:08.065 --> 19:09.524
Because you're mad at me, right?

19:09.691 --> 19:13.152
Not because Joe-Joes
taste like garbage?

19:18.116 --> 19:19.826
So, help me to understand...

19:19.910 --> 19:23.621
Dog friend's program
is to find what celebrities know?

19:23.788 --> 19:26.207
-Yep.
-So, is torture?

19:26.290 --> 19:28.960
We don't torture people
in America, Todd.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.129
That's called
one of the amendments.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.881
No, of course.

19:32.964 --> 19:36.009
In America,
you do not know to suffer.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.930
You eat your cheesy pizza,
you drink your ade of gator.

19:40.013 --> 19:44.101
This life is nice for visit
but no way for live.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.937
I go now. Back to palace!

19:47.020 --> 19:48.939
[shouting in Cordovian]

19:49.064 --> 19:51.190
Sounds great, Todd.
See you tomorrow.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.488
So, they hated the skorts idea, huh?

19:57.572 --> 19:59.532
No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.

19:59.616 --> 20:00.533
[man 1] Hey, Diane!

20:00.617 --> 20:02.827
Why don't you shut
your stupid ugly face?!

20:02.911 --> 20:04.162
Don't you talk to her like that!

20:04.245 --> 20:06.081
[man 2]
Yeah, don't listen to that guy, Diane.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.459
I say you should
shut your stupid pretty face.

20:09.626 --> 20:13.379
-This is not over. When people hear what--
-Give it a rest. It's over. You lost.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.799
-How could you say that?
-What are you doing here?

20:15.924 --> 20:18.009
I mean, what is your endgame
in all of this?

20:18.176 --> 20:22.388
You don't actually believe
Hank's innocent, do you?

20:22.472 --> 20:24.515
Of course not,
but that doesn't matter.

20:24.599 --> 20:25.934
You're not gonna beat this guy.

20:26.101 --> 20:26.935
I--

20:27.018 --> 20:27.852
[grunting]

20:28.019 --> 20:29.520
-What?
-Todd?

20:29.604 --> 20:31.648
BoJack!
Thank God you found me.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.399
I thought I would never see
you again.

20:33.524 --> 20:37.487
-We're in the middle of something.
-I got mixed up in some bad stuff

20:37.570 --> 20:41.532
and a genocide may or may not
have been perpetrated in my name.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.160
Maybe you heard about it
on the news?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.955
No, most of the news has been about
Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.499
What? Why? This is really serious.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.126
Oh, of course your thing is serious

20:51.209 --> 20:53.544
and my thing is just a dumb feminist
trying to get attention

20:53.628 --> 20:55.713
by attacking a famous man, is that it?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.256
Uh, what? No.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.467
-Eat shit, Diane!
-You eat shit!

20:59.592 --> 21:01.970
Diane, obviously Todd doesn't know
what you're talking about.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.764
He spent the last few days
at Burning Man or whatever getting high.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.683
No! That's not what happened at all.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.060
A stranger just told me to eat shit.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.521
I don't understand why you
can't be on my side about this.

21:11.646 --> 21:12.647
I am on your side.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.192
And I'm telling you
you're not gonna win this thing.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.778
Also, P.S., when have you ever
been on my side?

21:18.862 --> 21:20.905
-I am always on your side.
-Really?

21:20.989 --> 21:23.783
Like when you wrote that book?
Was that you being on my side?

21:23.867 --> 21:25.618
You're not still mad about the book.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.038
You manipulated me
and completely took advantage of--

21:28.205 --> 21:30.498
Guys? There is a very fragile alliance

21:30.581 --> 21:32.834
between the Cords and the Ovians.

21:32.917 --> 21:33.960
If we don't do something--

21:34.044 --> 21:35.712
-Todd, nobody cares.
-Nobody cares, Todd.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.464
Everything I did
was to help you tell the story

21:38.548 --> 21:40.884
I knew you wanted to tell.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.136
You got everything you wanted
because of that book.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.056
You were a joke,
now people take you seriously.

21:46.139 --> 21:49.017
You were out of work,
now you got your dream role.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.518
Okay, yes. All of that is true.

21:50.601 --> 21:54.564
But also, you were my friend
and you hurt my feelings.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.692
And it's weird that
you never apologized for that...

21:57.775 --> 21:58.776
and that you still won't.

21:58.943 --> 22:03.114
Well... [quietly]
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

22:04.032 --> 22:08.036
-Are you?
-Yes, actually. I am.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.328
I didn't want to do that

22:09.412 --> 22:11.998
and I probably could have
handled things better.

22:12.082 --> 22:16.086
I definitely should have.
I'm sorry.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.171
Okay.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.881
But this is bigger than you and me.

22:19.964 --> 22:23.676
And I need you in my corner now
because I don't have anybody else.

22:24.219 --> 22:25.720
[sighs]

22:25.803 --> 22:27.471
Well, okay.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.016
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.143
I'm in your corner.

22:32.227 --> 22:37.232
Guys, earlier, some general
asked me if it was "a go"

22:37.315 --> 22:39.025
...on "that thing we talked about"?

22:39.192 --> 22:43.280
And I said, "Yes." And he said,
"God help us all" and left the room.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.157
Now I'm not sure
that was the right answer.

22:48.118 --> 22:49.327
So, then I called Wayne to see

22:49.410 --> 22:51.746
if I could write a story for Buzzfeed.
Here's the good news:

22:51.829 --> 22:53.039
They'll publish anything.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.041
Hey, um...

22:55.125 --> 22:56.251
Can I talk to you?

22:56.417 --> 22:57.794
Yeah, of course. What's up?

22:57.877 --> 23:03.382
I asked you, really nicely,
not to make a big thing out of this.

23:03.549 --> 23:07.762
-Yeah, I know, but someone--
-Had to say something, right?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.431
And that someone had to be you?

23:10.514 --> 23:12.600
Because... why?

23:12.683 --> 23:14.435
I really don't get it.

23:14.518 --> 23:18.189
What is accomplished by you
being the one to take a stand on this?

23:18.273 --> 23:19.732
-Uh...
-[sighs]

23:19.816 --> 23:20.817
Mr. Peanutbutter--

23:20.984 --> 23:23.945
This game show
is a really big deal for me.

23:24.028 --> 23:27.406
And I know that sounds
stupid to you, and small.

23:27.490 --> 23:31.244
But I need this to go well,
and I can't... [sighs]

23:31.410 --> 23:32.703
Those are death threats.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.789
People want to murder my wife

23:34.872 --> 23:36.582
because of what she's
saying on the news

23:36.666 --> 23:39.669
about something that
she has nothing to do with.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.421
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

23:42.588 --> 23:44.674
-Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."
-Oh.

23:44.757 --> 23:49.470
God, you know, you'd almost
be safer in Cordovia.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.597
Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.391
I'm obviously not making
a difference here.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.810
Actually, maybe you should.

23:55.893 --> 23:59.063
Go feel good about yourself
and do your important work.

24:00.064 --> 24:04.235
And maybe some space
might be good for us.

24:04.694 --> 24:08.156
You don't really want me to go,
do you?

24:09.032 --> 24:11.575
Why does it suddenly matter
what I want?

24:18.082 --> 24:21.711
[man over PA] Flight 57,
Cordovian Airlines, now boarding.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.839
Hank, I have to ask, did you do it?

24:24.922 --> 24:26.007
No, I did not.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.718
Well, that's good enough for me.

24:28.801 --> 24:33.472
Coming up, Kanye West claims to hate
Thin Mints. Our panel is outraged.

24:33.681 --> 24:36.267
Hating Thin Mints?
Is he legally insane?

24:36.434 --> 24:38.853
You can bet we'll get into this
further in the next hour.

24:39.020 --> 24:42.023
This is the only thing
I care about now.

24:43.733 --> 24:44.567
[man] Hey.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.320
