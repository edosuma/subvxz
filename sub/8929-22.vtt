He could not have gone far.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.362
Yeah? Well, uh, you better hope so.

For your sake.

06:22.729 --> 06:26.263
Huh? Excuse me?

06:26.363 --> 06:29.330
Are you implying that the current situation

06:29.431 --> 06:31.831
is somehow my responsibility?

06:31.931 --> 06:35.598
Well, you did start it, gear-head.

Hey, Optimus, are you sure it was a good idea

06:48.734 --> 06:50.434
sending those two out together?

06:50.534 --> 06:52.500
To be honest, no.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.134
But their squabbling has caused problems before.

06:55.234 --> 06:56.735
They'll either learn to work together

or they'll destroy each other.

11:00.476 --> 11:04.009
Excellent. Yes.

11:04.109 --> 11:06.109
Prepare more of the virus immediately.

11:06.210 --> 11:09.276
We must infect the rest of the Maximals.

11:09.376 --> 11:11.877
Uh, there is a problem, Megatron.

11:11.977 --> 11:14.578
Uh, Tarantulas has not yet returned.

11:14.678 --> 11:17.511
And, as always, he's encoded his data tracks.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.812
I can't access them.

11:19.911 --> 11:21.579
Then find him.

11:21.679 --> 11:24.546
Start with his lab. Search everywhere.

Aah, this is absurd! Ugh!

Hey, we need spider boy there to get the countervirus,

11:57.351 --> 11:58.551
hot-head.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.985
And you know these caverns gotta lead to his lab.

12:02.085 --> 12:04.986
I know nothing of the sort!

12:05.086 --> 12:06.652
For, unlike you,

12:06.752 --> 12:10.587
I do not spend my time scurrying through sewers!

12:10.687 --> 12:12.020
Yeah?

12:12.121 --> 12:15.387
Well, a sewer smells better than your breath, bronto-brain!

You'll get used to it when I bite your useless head off.

12:21.655 --> 12:24.256
Die, Maximals!

BOTH: Shut up!

12:55.728 --> 12:57.461
Hm.

12:57.561 --> 12:58.761
( console beeping )

12:58.862 --> 12:59.862
Wha--?

13:05.696 --> 13:07.963
BLACKARACHNIA: Hm.

13:08.063 --> 13:11.064
So, uh, you got a better plan?

13:11.164 --> 13:13.464
Grr. No.

13:13.564 --> 13:17.531
But I still dislike the idea of expiring underground.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.898
It lacks a...

13:19.965 --> 13:22.799
A warrior's nobility.

13:22.899 --> 13:25.566
Oh, hey, no sweat, heh-heh.

13:25.666 --> 13:28.132
'Cause I ain't lettin' nobody waste you down here.

13:28.233 --> 13:31.400
That's a pleasure I'm reserving for myself.

13:31.501 --> 13:34.968
( sarcastically ): Ooh, I appreciate your concern.

13:35.068 --> 13:36.468
But let me assure you,

13:36.567 --> 13:39.635
being shot in the back by a malodorous mouse

13:39.735 --> 13:44.102
would not exactly earn me a seat in silicon Valhalla.

13:44.202 --> 13:48.669
RATTRAP: Aw. Poor baby.

13:48.769 --> 13:50.970
Blackarachnia to Megatron,

13:51.070 --> 13:53.238
I would suggest all Predacons

13:53.337 --> 13:55.638
report to Tarantulas' lab immediately.

13:55.737 --> 13:58.571
We're about to have company.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.740
( Rhinox sneezing )

14:10.840 --> 14:14.574
Wow! Now that's a wicked cold.

14:19.475 --> 14:21.008
We can't wait any longer.

14:21.108 --> 14:24.176
For Rhinox's sake, we'll have to launch a frontal attack.

14:24.276 --> 14:25.209

Wait. I'm coming too.

Hey, hang on, brood buddy.

14:32.144 --> 14:34.011
You're a little under the weather, aren't you?

14:34.110 --> 14:38.044
Hey, if I'm going to wreck the wallpaper,

14:38.144 --> 14:41.512
I might as well do it on Pred turf. Ugh.

14:41.612 --> 14:42.979
( grunts )

14:43.079 --> 14:45.846
Your power cells are dangerously low, Rhinox.

14:45.946 --> 14:48.347
Better convert to beast mode and eat something.

14:48.447 --> 14:50.247
It'll keep your energy up.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.847
Good idea.

14:56.748 --> 14:58.648
Airazor and I will take the point.

14:58.748 --> 15:02.549
The rest of you converge on the Pred base as fast as you can.

15:08.983 --> 15:11.084
( dramatic rock theme playing )

15:15.684 --> 15:18.318
( sniffs )

15:21.285 --> 15:23.418
Mm.

15:24.219 --> 15:26.586
( smacking lips )

15:37.088 --> 15:39.688
( liquid bubbling )

15:39.788 --> 15:41.788
( typing )

15:41.889 --> 15:43.722
( console beeps )

15:47.322 --> 15:49.557
BLACKARACHNIA: Ah! Here it is.

15:49.656 --> 15:51.323
The virus?

15:53.490 --> 15:57.558
No. The countervirus.

15:57.658 --> 16:00.658
Oh, it's probably what they're after.

16:00.758 --> 16:01.925
I'll destroy it.

16:02.025 --> 16:04.125
No!

16:04.225 --> 16:08.226
A bargaining chip should remain in play until the game is over.

16:08.326 --> 16:10.226
Yes.

16:10.326 --> 16:12.994
Why do you always talk to yourself?

16:13.094 --> 16:17.995
Oh, I simply have a penchant for intelligent conversation.

16:18.095 --> 16:21.095
( alarm beeping )

16:21.195 --> 16:22.562
Here they come.

16:27.596 --> 16:31.097
Hold your fire, you fools. Wait for the target.

16:34.097 --> 16:35.531
( grunts )

16:35.631 --> 16:36.631
( growling )

16:36.731 --> 16:39.632
Cover me, vermin.

16:47.332 --> 16:50.799
Hm.

16:50.900 --> 16:53.267
Do not fire, Megatron.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.268
I have a hostage.

16:55.368 --> 16:58.601
Why, so you do.

17:02.868 --> 17:07.936
Now, are there any other stupid Maximal ploys you wish to try?

17:10.637 --> 17:11.570
( Rattrap grunts )

17:11.670 --> 17:14.471
Well, how's this, scale-belly?

17:15.738 --> 17:17.237
WASPINATOR: No!

17:17.337 --> 17:18.404
( growling )

17:18.504 --> 17:20.105
( chuckling )

17:20.205 --> 17:21.772
Gotcha. Heh-heh-heh. Huh?

17:21.872 --> 17:23.006
( Rhinox groaning )

17:23.106 --> 17:25.172
Huh? Wha--?

17:25.273 --> 17:26.473
( Rhinox sneezing )

17:26.573 --> 17:28.706
( Scorponok screams )

17:28.806 --> 17:31.606
( dramatic theme playing )

17:31.706 --> 17:32.940
No one move.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.307
( sniffling )

17:34.407 --> 17:36.340
( growling )

17:36.440 --> 17:38.475
Hey, scrape-ape.

17:38.575 --> 17:40.341
Nice of you to show,

17:40.441 --> 17:44.042
but, uh, we already been here and done that.

17:44.142 --> 17:47.209
Situation under control.

17:47.309 --> 17:49.876
I think not. No.

17:49.976 --> 17:53.243
For I still have the countervirus.

17:53.343 --> 17:54.844
( gasps )

17:54.944 --> 17:56.911
MEGATRON: And unless you immediately convert to beast mode

17:57.011 --> 17:58.845
and surrender, your green comrade

17:58.945 --> 18:01.611
will soon go offline.

18:01.711 --> 18:03.279
Permanently.

18:04.846 --> 18:06.312
( groans )

18:06.412 --> 18:08.079
Don't.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.313
( Optimus sighs )

18:09.413 --> 18:10.680
No choice.

18:10.780 --> 18:13.647
Right now, our first priority is your survival.

18:13.747 --> 18:15.481
Beast mode.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.550
There are times

18:26.650 --> 18:29.316
when I would prefer to be a Predacon.

18:29.416 --> 18:31.716
( growls )

18:31.816 --> 18:35.884
You see? A bargaining chip is always useful.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.751
But now the game is over.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.318
( groaning )

18:43.852 --> 18:45.386
What's wrong?

18:45.486 --> 18:48.220
Wild bean vines.

18:48.319 --> 18:51.986
Hard to digest. Ugh.

18:53.487 --> 18:57.087
Do not turn your back on me, Maximal scum.

18:57.188 --> 18:59.121
( Rhinox groaning )

19:03.022 --> 19:08.390
Huh? Oh, no! Not that!

19:08.490 --> 19:10.423
( screams )

19:10.523 --> 19:12.523
( Rhinox farts )

19:19.791 --> 19:23.026
Ugh, that did it. Let's go!

19:23.125 --> 19:27.026
Not without the countervirus.

19:27.126 --> 19:28.626
( grunting )

19:30.193 --> 19:31.260
Gotcha!

19:34.594 --> 19:36.761
( dramatic theme playing )

19:39.328 --> 19:42.528
( slurping liquid )

19:42.628 --> 19:45.929
Eh, a little welding, a little paint, and hey.

19:46.029 --> 19:48.229
And the joint'll look like home again.

19:48.329 --> 19:52.263
Well, that's because you're used to rat holes.

19:52.363 --> 19:53.564
( Cheetor sighs )

19:53.664 --> 19:55.630
Never ends, does it?

19:55.730 --> 19:56.664
RHINOX: Ugh. Huh?

19:56.764 --> 19:58.531
( gasping )

19:58.631 --> 20:00.298
( gasps )

20:00.398 --> 20:02.299
( sneezing )

20:06.732 --> 20:08.699
Sorry.

20:08.799 --> 20:12.867
It could've been worse, right?

20:12.967 --> 20:16.501
( all laugh )

20:18.901 --> 20:21.935
Hm. This is certainly

20:22.035 --> 20:26.635
the most humiliating defeat of my entire career.

20:26.735 --> 20:29.069
Yes.

20:29.169 --> 20:31.736
( groaning )

20:36.038 --> 20:37.138
Oh!

20:46.806 --> 20:49.273
( dramatic rock theme playing )
