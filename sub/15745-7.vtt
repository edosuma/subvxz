WEBVTT

00:09.030 --> 00:13.300
ARE YOU LISTLESS?
BORED

00:13.330 --> 00:14.760
DO YOU DESPISE YOUR JOB?

00:14.800 --> 00:16.770
DO YOU SOMETIMES BANG YOUR HEAD

00:16.800 --> 00:18.840
AGAINST THE WALL FOR NO REASON?

00:18.870 --> 00:21.610
IF YOU ANSWERED YES
TO ANY OF THE ABOVE,

00:21.640 --> 00:25.740
WHAT YOU NEED
IS A VACATION!

00:25.780 --> 00:28.310
WHERE ONCE THERE WERE
ROCKY BEACHES,

00:28.350 --> 00:32.180
UNTAMED WILDERNESS
AND WILD TROPICS,

00:32.220 --> 00:36.450
UTOPIA ACRES IMPROVED
THIS VIRGIN ISLAND PROPERTY,

00:36.490 --> 00:40.260
BY PAVING IT OVER
INTO BRAND-NEW MEGA RESORTS!

00:40.290 --> 00:43.260
IT'S NATURE BEAUTIFICATION
AT ITS BEST.

00:43.290 --> 00:47.660
CALL UTOPIA ACRES NOW
AT TRIPLE-5 DOUBLE-0-2-6.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.730
BOOK YOUR DREAM VACATION TODAY.

00:49.770 --> 00:52.700
HA HA HA!
I KNOW I WILL!

00:54.470 --> 00:57.810
OH, BOY, AM I GREAT.
WHAT A SALESMAN!

00:57.840 --> 01:00.640
OH, AND SINCE
I'M THE OFFICIAL PITCHMAN,

01:00.680 --> 01:04.380
I CAN "R" AND "R" THERE
FREE ANYTIME.

01:04.410 --> 01:06.120
PRETTY SWEET, HUH?
WANNA WATCH IT AGAIN?

01:06.150 --> 01:08.320
WELL, IT'S PRETTY
SOMETHING.

01:08.350 --> 01:12.690
LEVELING TROPICAL ISLANDS
JUST TO PUT UP CONCRETE BOXES?

01:12.720 --> 01:15.460
CONCRETE RESORTS.

01:15.490 --> 01:18.400
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S WORSE.
YOU, OR ACE.

01:18.430 --> 01:19.560
HEY!

01:19.600 --> 01:22.270
VAPORIZING WEAPON PERMITS,

01:22.300 --> 01:23.830
DAMAGE CLAIMS.

01:23.870 --> 01:25.270
WITNESS STATEMENTS.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.840
THIS IS THE LAST TIME

01:26.870 --> 01:29.470
I'M DOING YOUR PAPERWORK.

01:29.510 --> 01:32.810
LOOK, I'M LESS
OF A DETAILS GUY

01:32.840 --> 01:35.780
AND MORE OF A FLYING-BY-THE-
SEAT-OF-MY-PANTS GUY.

01:35.810 --> 01:37.850
YEAH, THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO DO

01:41.520 --> 01:45.220
PICK YOUR POISON
AND I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

01:45.260 --> 01:49.260
WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD
ANY TIME OFF IN A WHILE.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.590
SURE, WHY NOT?

01:50.630 --> 01:53.260
GREAT IDEA, DUCK.
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?

01:53.300 --> 01:56.600
"WE"? I THOUGHT I'D--

01:56.630 --> 01:58.270
WELL, DON'T THINK.
IT'S ALREADY AGREED.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.900
LET'S GO.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.810
NOW, YOU SURE YOU'RE OK
STAYING BEHIND?

02:07.840 --> 02:10.810
YEAH, I CAN WORK ON
SOME OF MY SIDE PROJECTS.

02:10.850 --> 02:16.720
AND IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME
I'LL BE TOTALLY IN CHARGE.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.360
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
YOU BEING TOTALLY IN CHARGE,

02:18.390 --> 02:20.460
WHEN I'M THINKING,

02:20.490 --> 02:22.830
THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME
I'D BE TOTALLY IN CHARGE,

02:22.860 --> 02:24.430
AND YOU CAN BE SECOND-IN-CHARGE,
WHICH HAS NO REAL PURPOSE,

02:24.460 --> 02:25.830
EXCEPT TO ATTEND MALL OPENINGS,

02:25.860 --> 02:28.300
CHECK THE LOCKS
AT CLOSING TIME--AAH!

02:28.330 --> 02:29.630
YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.

02:29.670 --> 02:31.640
YOUR FIRST JOB
IS TO FIGURE OUT

02:31.670 --> 02:33.240
WHO'S IN CHARGE.

02:33.270 --> 02:35.510
THE ISLAND WE'RE HEADING TO

02:35.540 --> 02:36.740
IS APOCALYPSO.

02:36.770 --> 02:38.810
THE LAST UNDEVELOPED ONE.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.910
THE CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE
RIPPING IT UP AS WE SPEAK.

02:41.950 --> 02:44.480
UH, WE'RE GOING TO
THE ONE ISLAND

02:44.510 --> 02:46.920
WITHOUT WORKING BATHROOMS?

02:46.950 --> 02:49.590
NO BATHROOM?
HEE HEE HEE!

02:49.620 --> 02:52.720
OH, YEAH.
IT'LL BE A REAL ADVENTURE!

03:04.630 --> 03:05.800
YIKES!

03:05.840 --> 03:10.270
- UHH!

03:10.310 --> 03:14.610
I CAN'T HOLD IT.
WE'RE GOING DOWN!

03:14.640 --> 03:17.350
- WE'RE DOOMED! DOOMED!

I'LL FIRE THE FRONT THRUSTERS,

05:02.790 --> 05:05.420
AND TRANSFER ENERGY
TO THE REAR STABILIZERS.

05:05.460 --> 05:08.490
QUIT BLATHERING
AND JUST DO IT!

05:24.010 --> 05:25.740
ALL CLEAR!

05:28.040 --> 05:29.780
UHH. NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO

05:29.810 --> 05:32.650
IS FOLLOW THE SWEET SOUND
OF HEAVY MACHINERY

05:32.680 --> 05:37.090
TURNING GREEN
INTO CHA-CHING!

05:37.120 --> 05:39.760
FUNNY.
IT'S AWFULLY QUIET

05:39.790 --> 05:42.730
FOR A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.560
WOW. CHECK OUT
THE VOLCANO.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.130
THAT'S STILL HERE?

05:47.160 --> 05:49.000
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
BULLDOZED LAST WEEK

05:49.030 --> 05:51.900
FOR A TANNING CENTER.
OR A PARKING LOT.

05:51.940 --> 05:55.440
TECH, YOU THERE?
COME IN, TECH!

05:55.470 --> 05:56.940
HOW ABOUT YOU, REV?

05:56.970 --> 05:59.080
I DON'T THINK THIS PLACE

05:59.110 --> 06:01.450
IS AS DESERTED AS IT LOOKS.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.810
I HEAR SOMETHING.

06:02.850 --> 06:04.610
YEAH,
BUT WITH YOUR HEARING,

06:04.650 --> 06:06.850
IT COULD BE A DOG
SCRATCHING IT'S BUTT

06:06.880 --> 06:08.150
ABOUT A THOUSAND MILES AWAY.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.060
YOW!

06:13.090 --> 06:15.490
UHN...

06:15.530 --> 06:17.560
WHAT DID I SAY?

06:22.170 --> 06:23.570
HEE HEE HEE.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.940
WHOA.
WHOA.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.200
HUBBA-HUBBA HOOWEE.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.470
WE HAVE INTRUDERS,
MY QUEEN.

06:32.710 --> 06:36.450
TAKE ME TO YOUR LADDER.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.080
YOU PROBABLY RECOGNIZE ME
FROM TV.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.550
I'M DANGER DUCK,
ACTION HERO

06:43.590 --> 06:45.560
AND PITCH-MAN FOR
THIS LITTLE RESORT.

06:45.590 --> 06:48.630
AND I'D LIKE...TO...

06:48.660 --> 06:52.100
DO NOT ADDRESS THE QUEEN,
YOU FOWL.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.570
WHAT'S UP, DOC?
I'M ACE.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.500
OUR SHIP'S FEELING
A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER--

07:02.210 --> 07:04.170
HI!

07:09.080 --> 07:12.080
WHOA-HO!
YOU'RE FOUL, TOO.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.720
YOUR FIRST BATH
MUST HAVE BEEN YOUR LAST.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.050
THERE SHE IS, MY QUEEN.

07:17.090 --> 07:19.120
YOU MUST BE
THE LEADER.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.590
ME?
WELL, I GUESS I CAN SEE

07:21.630 --> 07:23.830
HOW YOU'D ASSUME THAT.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.700
HA HA.
I LIKE HOW YOU HANDLED

07:25.730 --> 07:28.500
THE OBNOXIOUS ONE
WITH THE BIG BEAK.

07:28.530 --> 07:30.230
WHA

07:30.270 --> 07:32.200
MY BEAK HAPPENS TO BE

07:32.240 --> 07:34.540
THE RIGHT SIZE
FOR MY HEAD.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.910
OH, YOU MEAN
WITH THE BRAIN BLAST?

07:36.940 --> 07:40.080
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
SUPER POWER OF MINE.

07:40.110 --> 07:41.850
SUPER POWER.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.780
IT MUST HELP YOU
KEEP YOUR MEN IN LINE.

07:44.810 --> 07:48.020
YEAH. BUT SOMETIMES
I THINK IT'D BE BETTER OFF

07:48.050 --> 07:49.750
IF I JUST GOT A DOG.

07:49.790 --> 07:51.020
HA HA HA HA HA!

07:55.090 --> 07:57.060
Lexi:

07:57.090 --> 07:59.300
WELCOME TO OUR ISLAND.

07:59.330 --> 08:03.530
I AM ATHENA,
QUEEN OF THE APOCAZANS.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.070
HA HA. I'M LEXI,

08:05.100 --> 08:08.270
QUEEN OF THE LOONATICS.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.240
HEY, SO WHAT GIVES, QUEENIE?

08:11.270 --> 08:14.040
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE PART
OF THE CONSTRUCTION CREW.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.050
AND YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU
HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.250
HUH-UH!

08:19.280 --> 08:20.880
I DON'T GET IT.

08:26.260 --> 08:27.760
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

08:27.790 --> 08:29.130
BUT I'M STARTING
TO GET THE FEELING

08:29.160 --> 08:31.730
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY WELCOME.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.030
MAYBE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS

08:35.060 --> 08:38.840
CAN ASK STRETCH IF WE
CAN GET ANY OF THEIR MEN

08:38.870 --> 08:40.640
TO HELP US WITH OUR SHIP.

08:40.670 --> 08:42.110
THERE ARE NO MEN.

08:42.140 --> 08:46.580
WE'RE A CIVILIZATION
OF ONLY WOMEN.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.610
I SEE.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.750
SO THAT'S HOW IT IS.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.820
BUT WE DO
HAVE SOME TOOLS

08:54.850 --> 08:56.720
BACK AT THE TEMPLE
YOU CAN USE.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.660
THAT IS,
IF YOU KNOW HOW.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.700
WELCOME TO
THE ROYAL PALACE

09:11.740 --> 09:14.240
OF THE APOCAZANS.

09:16.870 --> 09:19.640
SORRY, BIG BEAK,

09:19.680 --> 09:23.080
BUT ONLY WOMEN
ARE ALLOWED INSIDE.

09:23.110 --> 09:23.710
MY ATTENDANTS WILL
TAKE CARE OF YOU

09:38.290 --> 09:40.900
MMM.
WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD?

09:40.930 --> 09:44.270
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL
NECTAR OF OURS.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.970
TRY SOME.

09:48.140 --> 09:50.410
AH, DELICIOUS!

09:50.440 --> 09:51.680
HEY!

09:51.710 --> 09:52.880
IT'S THE SOURCE

09:52.910 --> 09:54.640
OF OUR SPIRITUAL ENERGY

09:54.680 --> 09:58.050
THAT BONDS US
AND MAKES US ONE WITH ALL.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.780
THE NECTAR CAN HELP YOU
TAP INTO POWERS

10:00.820 --> 10:02.690
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW YOU HAVE.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.900
WHOA!

10:17.070 --> 10:19.170
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

10:19.200 --> 10:20.940
GO AHEAD. TRY.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.080
HUH?

10:29.110 --> 10:30.710
WHOA!

10:34.450 --> 10:36.020
I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM

10:36.050 --> 10:39.360
RESPOND TO SOMEONE
SO--SO FAST.

10:39.390 --> 10:42.730
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS
HAD A GREEN THUMB.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.360
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW ACE.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.700
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ACE.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.400
WE'RE TAKING
CARE OF THE MEN.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.000
FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT,

10:51.030 --> 10:53.340
THE FEAST OF THE APOCAZANS.

10:53.370 --> 10:56.070
HO HO HO, YEAH!

10:56.110 --> 10:59.140
EATS. NOW THAT'S
MORE LIKE IT.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.180
MMM.

11:07.150 --> 11:09.750
IS IT THE

11:09.790 --> 11:11.320
NIGHTY NIGHT.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.090
HA HA.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.330
YES!

11:20.430 --> 11:22.830
- UH, THANKS, LADIES.
- HEY!

11:22.870 --> 11:24.300
-WELL, WE HAD A BIG BREAKFAST.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.340
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:26.370 --> 11:27.870
I'M STARVIN'.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.340
LOOK, SOUTHERN BONES.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.980
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SLAM

11:32.010 --> 11:35.140
PASS UP A MEAL FOR A SNOOZE?

11:39.450 --> 11:42.220
HA HA. NOW
IF YOU LADIES WILL EXCUSE ME,

11:42.250 --> 11:47.160
I THINK I NEED TO USE
THE LITTLE RABBIT'S ROOM.

11:47.190 --> 11:51.060
DUCK.

11:51.090 --> 11:52.530
AHEM.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.500
I HATE TO GO ALONE.

11:55.530 --> 11:58.000
THERE'S SOMETHING
WEIRD GOIN' ON.

11:58.030 --> 12:00.140
I THINK WE OUGHT
TO LOOK AROUND.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.140
WE'LL COME BACK
FOR SLAM LATER.

12:02.170 --> 12:05.140
MAKE SURE
THEY DON'T GET AWAY.

12:10.410 --> 12:13.050
WELL, I THINK WE LOST 'EM.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.520
THEY'LL NEVER CATCH US--

12:14.550 --> 12:17.820
UHH!
NOW.

12:17.850 --> 12:19.460
WHAT'S THAT?

12:19.490 --> 12:22.290
IF IT'S ROUND
AND ROLLING AROUND,

12:22.330 --> 12:24.060
IT'S PROBABLY MY HEAD.

12:24.090 --> 12:27.830
WHAT DO YOU KNOW.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.470
FROM UTOPIA ACRES.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.940
SO THAT'S WHY
THE WORK STOPPED.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.240
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE CREW.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.540
THAT'S FUNNY.

12:41.580 --> 12:44.110
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO EAT YOUR VEGETABLES.

12:44.150 --> 12:46.080
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!

13:05.470 --> 13:08.240
SOMETHIN' TELLS ME
THAT MULCH-FACE HERE

13:08.270 --> 13:10.540
ISN'T TOO KEEN
ON SEEING US.

13:10.570 --> 13:14.380
YEAH. PLANTLIFE SEEMS
A LITTLE MORE CLINGY

13:14.410 --> 13:16.380
THAN WHAT I'M USED TO.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.010
- AAH!

13:32.930 --> 13:34.130
HEY! DOWN HERE.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.530
WHOA.

13:58.990 --> 14:00.020
HYAH!

14:03.530 --> 14:06.430
HEY, WE REALLY
SHOWED THEM, ACE.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.100
THOSE VEGGIES
WILL THINK TWICE

14:08.130 --> 14:10.230
BEFORE MESSIN'
WITH THIS DUO.

14:10.270 --> 14:13.200
THEY SURE THINK
TWICE FAST!

14:13.240 --> 14:14.240
RUN!

14:17.340 --> 14:19.110
I NEVER KNEW PLANTS

14:19.140 --> 14:20.910
WERE SO LIGHT
ON THEIR FEET.

14:20.940 --> 14:24.480
HA HA. ESPECIALLY SINCE
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY!

14:24.510 --> 14:25.920
YAH!

14:25.950 --> 14:27.150
UHH!

14:29.020 --> 14:30.920
LOOK, THERE'S OUR SHIP.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.560
AAH!

14:32.590 --> 14:34.220
- UNH.
- UNH.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.710
WHEW! THAT WAS
A CLOSE CALL.

14:50.740 --> 14:53.140
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.950
OH, DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.250
GET THE TWEEZERS.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.620
OUCH!

14:59.650 --> 15:00.620
DOYE!

15:04.020 --> 15:06.960
THANKS FOR THE MAKEOVER,
ATHENA.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.260
EVERYONE LOOKS SO BUSY.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.660
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:14.700 --> 15:18.330
WE'RE PREPARING
FOR ZERO HOUR.

15:18.370 --> 15:20.500
WHAT'S ZERO HOUR?

15:20.540 --> 15:22.010
LET'S JUST SAY

15:22.040 --> 15:24.010
AFTER TODAY WE'LL FINALLY

15:24.040 --> 15:25.570
BE RID OF A CERTAIN PLANET

15:25.610 --> 15:28.310
AND THEIR
ANNOYING MALE CREATURES.

15:28.340 --> 15:31.650
I HAD A FEELING YOU
WEREN'T FROM AROUND HERE.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.320
HEE HEE. LOOK,
THANKS FOR THE TOUR,

15:34.350 --> 15:36.590
BUT I SHOULD
GET BACK TO THE GUYS.

15:36.620 --> 15:38.750
THEY GET KINDA ANTSY
WHEN LEFT ALONE.

15:38.790 --> 15:41.690
UH, YOU SAID YOU'D SHOW ME
WHERE YOU KEEP THE TOOLS.

15:41.720 --> 15:46.760
THERE'S SOMETHING I THINK
YOU'LL FIND MORE INTERESTING.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.200
COME.

15:52.640 --> 15:56.670
WOW. WHAT IS ALL THIS?

15:56.710 --> 16:00.610
THIS IS WHERE
WE MAKE OUR NECTAR.

16:00.640 --> 16:04.410
HMM. YOU GUYS
REALLY LIKE YOUR BEVERAGES.

16:04.450 --> 16:06.420
IT'S MORE THAN A BEVERAGE.

16:06.450 --> 16:08.150
IT'S OUR ENERGY SOURCE

16:08.180 --> 16:11.020
THAT MAKES
THE ZERO HOUR POSSIBLE.

16:11.050 --> 16:13.290
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.390
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME ALL THIS?

16:15.420 --> 16:18.530
BECAUSE WE WOULD
LIKE YOU TO JOIN US.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.700
WE COULD USE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU,

16:20.730 --> 16:23.430
WITH YOUR SPECIAL TALENTS.

16:23.470 --> 16:26.700
YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE MY FRIENDS?

16:26.740 --> 16:28.170
FRIENDS?

16:28.200 --> 16:30.470
WE SAW HOW THEY
TREATED YOU.

16:30.510 --> 16:33.280
IT WAS THE SAME
WITH OUR MEN.

16:33.310 --> 16:36.580
UNTIL WE
TOOK CARE OF THINGS.

16:36.610 --> 16:37.610
UH...

16:37.650 --> 16:39.520
TOOK CARE OF THINGS?

16:39.550 --> 16:43.490
EXACTLY WHAT THINGS
DID YOU TAKE CARE OF?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.820
QUEEN ATHENA,
WE HAVE TROUBLE.

16:45.850 --> 16:49.190
LEXI,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:49.230 --> 16:49.760
PLEASE THINK IT OVER.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.130
WE GOT TO
GET INSIDE THE TEMPLE,

16:55.160 --> 16:55.800
FIND LEXI,

16:55.830 --> 16:57.300
THEN PICK UP SLAM,

16:57.330 --> 16:59.100
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

16:59.140 --> 17:01.070
IN 5 CHICK CENTRAL?

17:01.100 --> 17:02.570
HOW ARE WE
GONNA GET PAST

17:02.610 --> 17:05.170
MEAN AND GREEN
AT THE DOOR?

17:05.210 --> 17:06.080
HMM.

17:06.110 --> 17:08.440
I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.080
Danger: SO, HOW DO I LOOK?

17:16.590 --> 17:19.120
SEEMS LIKE THE PLANTLIFE
AROUND HERE

17:19.160 --> 17:21.260
ARE SUCKERS
FOR A-LIST DISGUISES.

17:24.190 --> 17:27.100
OH, YEAH.
LUCKY FOR US GIRLS.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.470
LET'S FIND LEXI.

17:36.770 --> 17:39.440
WHAT'S THAT?

17:39.480 --> 17:42.710
TIME FOR A SMALL DIVERSION.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.310
HERE'S A LITTLE BRAIN BLAST.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.820
HEY.

18:05.730 --> 18:10.710
PLANTS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.140
ECCH. NOT WHAT
YOU'D NORMALLY FIND

18:13.180 --> 18:15.580
AT YOUR LOCAL FLORIST.

18:21.450 --> 18:24.150
THE UTOPIA ACRES LOGO.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.190
WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.560
HUH?

18:38.830 --> 18:40.800
NO!

18:40.840 --> 18:44.540
- HELLO! SLAM!

18:44.570 --> 18:46.840
ANYBODY HOME?

18:51.950 --> 18:54.350
THE MISSING WORKMEN.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.820
COME ON GUYS.
YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE.

18:57.850 --> 18:59.320

18:59.360 --> 19:02.830

19:09.670 --> 19:11.770
OUCH. EECH!

19:11.800 --> 19:14.640
ECH.

19:14.670 --> 19:17.240
WE'D BETTER

19:17.270 --> 19:19.640
THESE PUMPS
ARE KILLING ME.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.610
2 WORDS--
KEEP WALKIN'.

19:22.650 --> 19:23.910
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

19:23.950 --> 19:25.780
YOU DON'T HAVE
WEBBED FEET.

19:25.810 --> 19:27.920
AND OH, THE BLISTERS.

19:30.950 --> 19:32.990
HELLO, GIRLS.

19:37.030 --> 19:40.600
SOMEONE DOES NOT KNOW
HOW TO DRESS.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.830
DOES SHE KNOW
SHE'S IN PUBLIC?

19:42.870 --> 19:43.930
ATHENA,

19:43.970 --> 19:45.300
WE CAN'T FIND

19:45.330 --> 19:47.640
THOSE LOONATICS ANYWHERE.

19:47.670 --> 19:49.510
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?!

19:49.540 --> 19:51.370
This is not good!

19:51.410 --> 19:53.440
AHEM.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.780
OH, EXCUSE ME,

19:57.810 --> 20:00.280
BUT WE SEEM TO BE
A LITTLE LOST.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.680
WE'RE FROM OUT OF TOWN,

20:01.720 --> 20:05.250
VISITING RELATIVES.

20:05.290 --> 20:06.660
UM, UM, OH, DEAR!

20:06.690 --> 20:09.020
I THINK I SEE THEM
RIGHT OVER THERE.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.990
HA HA! TOODLES.

20:16.830 --> 20:18.830
- WHOA!
- WHOA!

20:18.870 --> 20:23.870
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE, BOYS.

20:23.910 --> 20:26.540
UHH.
HELP--

20:27.910 --> 20:30.780
Both: UHH...

20:50.600 --> 20:51.730
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,

20:51.770 --> 20:53.400
TRYING TO DRESS LIKE GIRLS?

20:53.440 --> 20:54.600
AND HOW DO I GET THEM OUT?

20:56.440 --> 20:59.070
ZERO HOUR--

20:59.110 --> 21:02.040
ANNOYING MALE CREATURES.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.410
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.580
OK, LEXI. THINK.

21:10.450 --> 21:12.050
I KNOW.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.470
I'M GONE A FEW HOURS,

21:29.510 --> 21:33.810
AND YOU GUYS ARE
ALREADY INTO MY CLOTHES.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.080
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

21:35.110 --> 21:36.950
WHO ARE
THE SLEEPING BEAUTIES?

21:36.980 --> 21:38.810
THE MISSING WORKERS.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.820
THIS ISLAND'S INFESTED
WITH MAN-EATING PLANTS

21:40.850 --> 21:43.420
THAT ARE ALSO PRETTY FOND
OF RABBIT AND DUCK.

21:43.450 --> 21:45.090
NOW, WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE!

21:45.120 --> 21:47.960
ATHENA SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A ZERO HOUR.

21:47.990 --> 21:49.760
AND HOW TODAY THEY'D
HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY

21:49.790 --> 21:53.400
TO FINALLY BE RID
OF A CERTAIN PLANET.

21:53.430 --> 21:55.830
YEP, THAT SURE
SOUNDS LIKE ALIEN CODE

21:55.860 --> 21:59.000
FOR DESTROYING THE WORLD.

21:59.030 --> 22:02.140
BUT WHY BLOW UP
THE PLANET THEY'RE ON?

22:02.170 --> 22:04.110
WHO KNOWS
HOW CHICKS THINK.

22:04.140 --> 22:06.940
YOU'D ALMOST
HAVE TO BE ONE.

22:06.980 --> 22:08.380
HMPH.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.610
WHAT?

22:10.650 --> 22:12.750
LOOK, THE SECRET
TO THEIR POWER

22:12.780 --> 22:14.150
LIES IN THEIR NECTAR.

22:14.180 --> 22:15.680
IF WE CAN
BLOW UP THEIR VATS,

22:15.720 --> 22:17.990
WE CAN STOP THEM
IN THEIR TRACKS!

22:18.020 --> 22:23.860
LET'S MOVE BEFORE ATHENA
SUSPECTS ANYTHING.

22:23.890 --> 22:25.830
STOP! SLAM!
GRAB THE TOOLS

22:25.860 --> 22:28.030
AND GET THE CREW
BACK TO THE SHIP.

22:28.060 --> 22:29.730
YOU GOT IT, ACE.

22:29.770 --> 22:31.100
THIS WAY, GUYS.

22:36.670 --> 22:39.640
TECH. TECH!
YOU READ ME, TECH?

22:39.680 --> 22:41.640
REV. ANYBODY!

22:49.050 --> 22:50.550
YO, COMEDY DUO.

22:50.590 --> 22:52.790
WE GOT
REAL PROBLEMS HERE.

22:52.820 --> 22:55.420
WE NEED YOUR HELP!

22:57.860 --> 23:01.930
Athena: LEXI, I OFFERED
YOU A PLACE WITH US,

23:01.960 --> 23:03.530
BUT INSTEAD, YOU--

23:03.570 --> 23:05.670
YOU CHOSE TO BETRAY US.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.670
UNH!

23:09.710 --> 23:10.940
DESTROY THEM!

23:10.970 --> 23:13.180
NO. STOP.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.780
I THOUGHT WE
UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.190
WHOA!

23:34.800 --> 23:36.700
BACK OFF!

23:45.240 --> 23:47.940
ACE! THE NECTAR!

23:47.980 --> 23:50.010
GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD--
ATTACK!

23:52.180 --> 23:53.880
UNH.

23:58.090 --> 24:00.760
ZERO HOUR'S OVER, QUEENIE.

24:00.790 --> 24:05.160
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

24:05.190 --> 24:07.030
UHH YAA!

24:09.100 --> 24:10.830
OH!

24:10.870 --> 24:13.170
- UNH.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.600
UNH!

24:14.640 --> 24:18.140
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!

24:18.170 --> 24:20.740
YEAH.
BY STOPPING YOU ALIENS

24:20.780 --> 24:23.480
FROM DESTROYING
OUR PLANET!

24:26.750 --> 24:28.120
IT'S YOU
AND YOUR DEVELOPERS

24:28.150 --> 24:30.690
WHO TRIED
TO DESTROY THIS ISLAND.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.590
JUST AS OUR MEN
DID TO OUR PLANET.

24:33.620 --> 24:36.490
YOUR MEN,
WHO NO LONGER EXIST.

24:38.290 --> 24:40.900
NO. THEY EXIST...

24:40.930 --> 24:43.130
ALL AROUND YOU.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.300
YOU TURNED THEM
INTO VEGETABLES?

24:48.340 --> 24:50.540
THEY EVOLVED.

24:50.570 --> 24:52.810
NOW WE
COEXIST PEACEFULLY.

24:52.840 --> 24:56.750
THEY'VE NEVER
BEEN HAPPIER.

24:56.780 --> 24:59.110
WHAT ABOUT
THE CONSTRUCTION CREW?

24:59.150 --> 25:00.920
WE WERE GONNA
RELEASE THEM

25:00.950 --> 25:04.550
ONCE WE WERE
ON OUR WAY TO A LESS...

25:04.590 --> 25:07.060
HOSTILE PLANET.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.220
YOU WERE
PLANNING TO LEAVE?

25:13.600 --> 25:14.260
GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD!

25:21.340 --> 25:23.970
HEY, LEX. YOU SURE
THIS IS GONNA WORK?

25:24.010 --> 25:26.680
NO, BUT WE HAVE
NO OTHER CHOICE.

25:26.710 --> 25:30.310
IF DUCK CAN USE HIS WATER POWERS
TO SUCK IN ENOUGH SEAWATER,

25:30.350 --> 25:32.750
I THINK I CAN DO THE REST.

25:32.780 --> 25:35.650
NO PROBLEM.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.290
THERE'S NO ONE WHO
SUCKS LIKE ME.

25:41.660 --> 25:43.260
AQUA DENSE!
