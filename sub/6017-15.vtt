00:02.068 --> 00:04.628
Aren't mannequins kind of an insult
to your imagination?

00:06.072 --> 00:07.630
You couldn't visualize a sweater...

00:07.841 --> 00:10.503
...so we'll show you on this
life-size, snotty puppet.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.009
When they're finished
they become crash-test dummies.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.908
The end of the line
for a mannequin.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.747
"Whatever happened to Bob?"

00:16.916 --> 00:19.077
"Have you seen that
new Volvo commercial?

00:19.586 --> 00:22.350
He's got a bull's-eye
right in his face."

00:22.689 --> 00:25.988
Mannequins are only used
for car accidents and fashion...

00:26.192 --> 00:29.628
...two situations that it's impossible
for us to imagine ourselves:

00:29.796 --> 00:31.627
Well-dressed or getting killed.

00:32.131 --> 00:34.066
I'm sure some
pro-mannequin organization...

00:34.234 --> 00:35.963
...doesn't like
the term "mannequin."

00:36.136 --> 00:39.799
"Hey, they're not mannequins.
They're the life-deprived."

00:44.210 --> 00:47.202
-That was really good.
-Yeah. Are you full?

00:47.380 --> 00:49.439
Oh, no. I've had just enough.

00:49.616 --> 00:52.244
Ah, here we go. Apple pie.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.411
Best apple pie in the city.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.493
Delicious.

01:01.694 --> 01:03.491
I'm not waiting for you.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.164
Take some.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.727
-No, thanks.
-You're not gonna have any?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.097
-No.
-Do you not like apple pie?

01:12.172 --> 01:14.766
-No. It's not that.
-Well, at least taste it.

01:14.941 --> 01:16.169
No.

01:17.944 --> 01:20.811
-You won't even taste it?
-No.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.915
Come on, try it.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.775
A little taste.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.888
Come on.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.916
She wouldn't so much as taste it.

01:35.962 --> 01:37.554
-Did she say why?
-No.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.925
She just kept shaking
her head like this:

01:41.901 --> 01:43.232
-Maybe she's diabetic.
-No.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.633
She carries Entenmanns doughnuts
in her purse.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.603
Maybe you said something
that offended her.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.437
I told her we should have moving
walkways all over city.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.847
-Like at the airport?
-Yeah.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.449
-That's a great idea.
-Tell me about it.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.587
-We could be zipping everywhere.
-They could at least try it.

02:01.754 --> 02:03.551
-They never try.
-What's the harm?

02:03.723 --> 02:05.122
No harm!

02:05.792 --> 02:08.658
I'm sorry. There's no reason
for her not to taste that pie.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.489
-Who wouldn't taste the pie?
-Audrey.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.255
Dump her.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.864
I never broke up with anyone
for not tasting pie.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.530
I once broke up with someone
for not offering me pie.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.940
-You did?
-He could be eating a hero...

02:22.108 --> 02:24.702
...he wouldn't offer me anything.
It's a sickness.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.436
Well, I can't walk anywhere now.

02:27.614 --> 02:30.276
I'm just gonna be wishing
there were walkways.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.518
-What are you doing?
-I got a pebble.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.551
I never heard of that
happening to a woman.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.386
What the hell does that mean?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.285
Hey. Oh, hey, Elaine.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.052
-What?
-Go like this:

02:42.228 --> 02:44.890
-What? Why?
-Do it, do it.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.190
-Like this:
-Like...

02:48.067 --> 02:50.331
...like this?
-Oh, yeah!

02:50.503 --> 02:51.936
It's you!

02:52.505 --> 02:54.666
-What's me?
-There's a clothing store downtown.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.708
They got a mannequin in there
that looks exactly like Elaine.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.742
-Get out!
-It's uncanny!

02:59.913 --> 03:03.178
It's like they chopped off your arms
and legs, dipped you in plastic...

03:03.349 --> 03:06.318
...screwed you all back together,
and stuck you on a pedestal.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.714
It's really quite exquisite.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.684
-What's the name of the store?
-Rinitze.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.384
Oh, yeah.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.524
May I help you?

03:19.766 --> 03:22.234
It's this itch. I was watching TV
without my shirt on...

03:22.402 --> 03:25.064
...and my couch cushion
didn't have any fabric on it.

03:25.471 --> 03:28.838
Wait a minute. Rinitze. Don't they
have some really cool suits in there?

03:29.008 --> 03:30.566
Real boss.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.711
-I'm going down there.
-I'll go with you.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.007
I gotta get a new suit. I got a second
interview with MacKenzie.

03:36.182 --> 03:39.549
I think I'm really close.
They're taking me to lunch on Friday.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.946
-Aren't you gonna need this?
-Keep it.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.255
It looks exactly like me.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.190
It's like some pod landed from
another planet and took your body.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.633
Don't fall asleep, Elaine.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.634
What's going on?
How do you think this happened?

04:03.343 --> 04:05.777
Whoa, look at this.

04:06.279 --> 04:08.839
This is a beautiful suit, huh?

04:09.482 --> 04:12.713
You think that could be a coincidence,
George? Is that possible?

04:12.986 --> 04:15.284
You are perfect for that suit.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.118
You think so?

04:18.625 --> 04:20.786
Excuse me.
Where did this come from?

04:20.959 --> 04:22.427
I don't know.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.426
You really think this looks
okay on me?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.464
Fabulous. Perfect fit.
And it's the last one we have.

04:28.034 --> 04:32.095
I'm sorry. You can't tell me
where the mannequin came from?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.763
I told you. I don't know.

04:36.843 --> 04:41.473
Well, is there somebody around here
I could talk to who would know?

04:41.981 --> 04:43.346
Why?

04:43.516 --> 04:46.485
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin
looks exactly like me.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.947
Did you just roll your eyes at him?

04:51.357 --> 04:54.019
If anybody should be
rolling their eyes...

04:54.193 --> 04:56.684
...it is me at him about you.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.529
I think maybe
you're flattering yourself.

05:01.701 --> 05:04.670
That mannequin is wearing
a $1200 Gaultier dress.

05:05.605 --> 05:09.507
What are you saying, that I'm not
good enough for this hideous dress?

05:09.776 --> 05:11.801
Listen, Natasha...

05:13.079 --> 05:15.013
I wouldn't be caught dead...

05:15.181 --> 05:18.116
...wearing your crummy
little Eurotrash rags.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.912
I'll meet you outside.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.587
-What is her problem?
-What can you do?

05:27.694 --> 05:29.093
Is this the price tag?

05:29.262 --> 05:32.493
-Yes.
-Yes, hello. Party's over.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.930
I'll tell you a little secret.
We're having an unadvertised sale...

05:36.102 --> 05:38.764
...starting Friday.
That suit will be half-price.

05:38.938 --> 05:41.429
You think you could put it
aside and hold it for me?

05:41.607 --> 05:43.268
I'm afraid I couldn't do that.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.968
It wouldn't be fair
to the other customers.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.306
Oh, yes, of course.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.073
And we have to be fair.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:59.926 --> 06:01.120
So...

06:01.327 --> 06:04.125
...I found out who supplies
the mannequins and I called him up.

06:04.297 --> 06:08.028
-How did they get your face?
-I don't know, they wouldn't tell me.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.501
Jerry?

06:11.104 --> 06:12.594
Hello?

06:15.641 --> 06:17.370
Excuse me.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.103
I noticed you offered her
a piece of your pie.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.803
That's right.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.210
-And you waved it away.
-Right.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.615
-Did you give her a reason?
-Yes.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.617
-I was full.
-You were full.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.314
So you gave a reason.
You didn't just shake your head.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.052
-No. I'm not a psycho.
-Exactly.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.824
You're not a psycho.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.063
You've been very helpful. Thank you
very much. Allow me to leave the tip.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.402
Well, I think we've proven
who the psycho is.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.908
We certainly have.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.142
Hey, Elaine, scratch my back.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.977
-No way.
-One lap around.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.017
-No.
-It'll be a funky adventure.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.450
-Kramer, forget it.
-Jerry, how about you?

07:03.623 --> 07:05.523
I think you know my policy.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.125
I'm going home to spatula.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.423
I thought George
was meeting us here.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.624
No. He's going downtown
to guard the suit.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.002
He's guarding a suit?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.373
Do you need some
help with that itch?

07:21.541 --> 07:23.941
Madam, I pray
you're not toying with me.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.643
-Turn around.
-Oh, all right.

07:49.368 --> 07:52.132
-It fits you perfectly.
-You think so?

07:52.872 --> 07:55.636
What is this? Can't I leave
this place for a second?

08:07.086 --> 08:08.815
Can I help you?

08:10.223 --> 08:11.986
I'm buying this suit.

08:12.458 --> 08:16.326
-No. This suit is not for sale.
-Excuse me, do you work here?

08:18.130 --> 08:19.495
No.

08:20.366 --> 08:22.732
Then what the hell
business is it of yours?

08:22.902 --> 08:24.426
I'm doing you a favor.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.366
They're having
an unadvertised sale.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.666
This suit will be
half-price starting Monday.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.368
-Really? This Monday?
-Yes. Take off those pants.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.241
Actually, the unadvertised sale
starts on Friday.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.649
Friday? Thanks.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.178
You know, for an unadvertised sale,
you're doing a lot of yapping about it.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.263
I can't believe
your father owns this place.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.939
So how are the desserts here?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.542
Everything is delicious.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.409
-You've tasted them?
-I think almost all of them.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.079
Oh, I see they have apple pie.

09:17.857 --> 09:21.054
-You've had the apple pie?
-Many times.

09:22.962 --> 09:26.090
Audrey, I gotta be honest with you.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.666
I'm a very curious guy.
It's my nature. I need to know things.

09:29.835 --> 09:33.430
Not tasting the apple pie
the other day, I can't get past it.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.403
You obviously like pies.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.874
You carry doughnuts in your bag.
You're not averse to pastry.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.740
Surely you could see how such
a thing would prey on my mind.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.075
-Can we drop this?
-Why can't I know?

09:44.884 --> 09:47.512
-Oh, Poppie.
-Sweetheart, hello.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.145
Poppie, this is Jerry.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.284
-Welcome.
-Hello, Poppie.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.090
Don't fill up on the bread.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.127
I'm making you
a very special dinner.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.196
Very special.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.734
The pies.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.633
I'm going to the bathroom.
You know.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.012
Ah, Jerry!

10:19.418 --> 10:22.387
Tonight you're in for a real treat.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.182
I'm personally gonna
prepare the dinner...

10:25.358 --> 10:27.417
...for you and my Audrey.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.444
Jerry, are you okay?

10:49.148 --> 10:50.513
Is anything wrong?

10:52.818 --> 10:54.376
No. Nothing.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.346
You look like you've seen a ghost.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.164
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.632
Hey.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.374
-These are for you, Olive.
-Thank you.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.218
Here it is.

11:29.488 --> 11:32.389
Oh, wait till you taste this.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.158
Poppie, this is perfect.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.332
Well?

11:44.904 --> 11:46.371
Jerry, have some.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.472
You're not gonna taste it?

11:54.980 --> 11:56.675
Jerry.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.294
So she thought I did it
to get back at her.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.760
Why didn't you just tell her?

12:11.931 --> 12:14.832
It's not the kind of thing
you wanna hear about your father.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.962
When he came out of that bathroom,
and he was kneading that dough...

12:19.438 --> 12:21.463
...it was a wild scene.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.403
How could he not have washed?

12:24.610 --> 12:26.601
Even if you're not gonna soap up...

12:27.012 --> 12:30.778
...at least pretend, for my benefit.
Turn the water on. Do something.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.517
Yeah, just like I do.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.919
You know, a chef who doesn't wash
is like a cop who steals.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.526
It's a cry for help.
He wants to get caught.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.458
I think Poppie's got some problems.

12:44.630 --> 12:47.190
There's a whole other thing
going on with Poppie.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.958
-So how did you leave it?
-We haven't spoken.

12:51.637 --> 12:55.505
Hey. Hey, George.
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.368
I got Olive.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.803
-Olive?
-My lady friend down at Monk's.

13:01.981 --> 13:05.542
You guys ought to see the way
she works her nails across my back.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.146
She's a maestro... The crisscross...

13:10.322 --> 13:13.485
...the figure eight,
strumming the old banjo...

13:13.659 --> 13:16.651
...and this wild, savage free-for-all...

13:16.829 --> 13:18.660
...where anything can happen.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.356
I gotta get downtown
and buy that suit.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.970
-Store opens in 20 minutes.
-Is that Elaine mannequin still there?

13:25.137 --> 13:28.004
Yeah. The last time I saw her...

13:28.541 --> 13:30.509
...she was naked.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.207
Yeah. And Poppie's got problems.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.020
Where is it? Where is it?

13:47.593 --> 13:49.720
Well, look at this.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.523
This doesn't belong here.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.696
Someone has made
a terrible mistake.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.131
You bastard!

13:59.438 --> 14:02.236
-You hid the suit.
-Hid?

14:02.441 --> 14:05.433
I have no idea
how this suit got misplaced.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.405
Nevertheless, I do believe
I shall purchase it.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.879
I hope you rot in that suit.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.281
I'll get you for this. I don't know how,
but I'm gonna get you.

14:14.453 --> 14:17.547
-You are gonna pay.
-Oh, I'll pay.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.849
Half-price.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.620
<i>Arrivederci,</i> my fellow 40-short.

14:25.764 --> 14:29.598
I made a list of people who might
have made the mannequin.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.861
You know, possible suspects.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.369
-Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
-Okay.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.704
All right, well, there's this blind guy
at a party I was at...

14:38.878 --> 14:41.870
...and he felt my face
for a really long time...

14:42.047 --> 14:43.844
...to see what I looked like.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.484
He almost put
his finger up my nose.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.950
-What else you got?
-Okay.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.850
I won't tell you the rest of the list.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.888
Because I didn't think
the blind guy did it?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.787
Because you have an attitude.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.196
Oh, Georgie.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.665
-Nice duds.
-You're telling me.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.976
So, what do you think?

15:13.646 --> 15:15.944
-Did you hear something?
-Yeah, like a swoosh.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.446
Yeah.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.250
It must be the fabric.

15:21.453 --> 15:24.820
It's rubbing between your thighs
when you walk.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.720
That's what's making
that swooshy sound.

15:35.401 --> 15:38.859
I didn't hear it on the way over
because of the street noise.

15:42.708 --> 15:43.936
This is no good!

15:44.109 --> 15:46.543
I gotta meet these guys
from MacKenzie for lunch!

15:46.979 --> 15:48.606
So what? What would they care?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.942
This MacKenzie guy,
he's a bit of a nut.

15:51.116 --> 15:55.382
He fired the last guy because
his nose whistled when he breathed.

15:55.554 --> 15:58.318
So you're not gonna get the job
because your pants make noise?

15:58.490 --> 16:00.651
Let's say it's between me
and one other guy.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.624
He's got a quiet suit,
and I'm whooshing all over the place!

16:03.796 --> 16:05.627
Who do you think he's gonna hire?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.062
All these interviews
are making you nuts.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.565
Jerry, I saw your girlfriend
was in here before.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.466
-Audrey?
-Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.507
-Was it apple?
-What else?

16:17.676 --> 16:20.008
This woman is bending
my mind into a pretzel.

16:22.214 --> 16:23.909
Do I know you?

16:24.883 --> 16:26.145
No, you don't.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.149
Yeah.

16:28.387 --> 16:32.483
You were wearing a G-string
and one of those bras with points.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.389
The mannequin!

16:36.962 --> 16:39.260
Oh, I gotta see this thing.

16:46.271 --> 16:49.206
Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.

16:51.610 --> 16:54.044
You think you can pose me
however you want?

16:54.213 --> 16:56.647
That's my ass in your window.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.218
It's our mannequin.
We can do whatever we want.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.412
No. You take that mannequin
down right now...

17:03.655 --> 17:06.988
...or I am pressing charges.
Yes. This is my attorney.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.252
Yeah? What law am I breaking?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.730
I believe there is some
legal precedent...

17:11.930 --> 17:16.195
<i>... Winchell v. Mahoney.</i>
The Charlie McCarthy hearings.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.598
-Are you taking this down?
-I'm getting the manager.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.969
-Jerry, get the car.
-What are you doing?

17:22.174 --> 17:24.300
-Just get the car.
-As your legal counsel...

17:24.476 --> 17:26.671
...I must advise against this.

17:33.485 --> 17:37.421
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
a hankering for some Doublemint gum.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.220
I'm dropping you off at work, right?

17:40.426 --> 17:41.950
Where are you going?

17:42.728 --> 17:44.457
Poppie's.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.199
Thanks for meeting me
down here, George.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.734
My office is out of control. Phones
ringing, people running in and out.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.069
Did you hear something?

17:57.276 --> 17:59.176
No, I didn't hear anything.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.910
That's strange.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.909
It's quieter down here.

18:05.117 --> 18:08.018
We can concentrate without
people whooshing around.

18:11.123 --> 18:12.488
That sound again.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.184
Sure you didn't hear anything?

18:16.395 --> 18:18.363
No, can't say as I did.

18:19.998 --> 18:21.625
Kind of like a...

18:21.800 --> 18:23.427
...rustling.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.433
Could be the leaves.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.739
That's right. Poppie's on 77th.

18:32.911 --> 18:35.505
Okay. We'll see you at 8.
Bye-bye.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.909
Hello.

18:37.216 --> 18:40.515
-What are you doing here?
-So how was the pie?

18:40.686 --> 18:42.847
-What pie?
-The apple pie...

18:43.021 --> 18:44.488
...you had today at Monk's.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.691
-I'm very busy here.
-Pretty good, wasn't it?

18:47.860 --> 18:49.885
I told you you should've tasted it.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.729
You better not let
Poppie see you.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.990
All right, I'm looking for Poppie.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.031
-Who are you?
-Board of Health.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.669
-We've had complaints.
-Oh, about the, uh...

19:00.005 --> 19:02.337
-You Poppie?
-I'm Poppie.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.176
Think you better come with me.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.504
What's the problem?

19:08.347 --> 19:10.508
What do they want from Poppie?

19:10.682 --> 19:12.946
Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.624
You thought I'd care
about your pants whooshing?

19:23.462 --> 19:26.989
I heard the last guy got fired
because his nose whistled.

19:27.299 --> 19:31.258
No. He got fired because
he wasn't a team player.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.665
That's something we don't joke
about at MacKenzie.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.002
We're a team here.
We don't tolerate dissent.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.767
You wanna go your own way,
you're in the wrong place.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.212
No problem there.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.747
Conformity's an obsession with me.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.717
Chocolate cream pie,
compliments of the house.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.045
Hope you saved room for dessert.

19:51.223 --> 19:54.351
The chef said that
he made it special for you.

19:59.164 --> 20:00.563
Best pie I've ever tasted.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.394
Take a bite, George.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.131
Take a bite.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.433
It's delicious.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.133
I insist.

20:12.311 --> 20:15.109
If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.283
-So you didn't get the job?
-No.

20:23.655 --> 20:27.216
But I was the only one at the table
that didn't get violently ill.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.355
Kramer, you can't keep
avoiding her like this.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.325
-You have to say something.
-What?

20:32.497 --> 20:34.931
-Tell her you lost your itch.
-What happened to it?

20:35.100 --> 20:37.000
I lost it two days ago.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.899
I've been faking it
so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.801
You should tell her.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.537
I'll let her down easy.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.643
All right.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.847
Well. Hi, Olive.

20:51.049 --> 20:53.813
No, no. No more of that.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.012
-There's something I have to tell you.
-What?

20:57.589 --> 20:59.147
Well, there's someone else.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.985
-Someone else?
-Yeah.

21:01.159 --> 21:02.683
Who is she?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.658
Her.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.032
-Her?
-Yeah. There she is.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.326
-That's my gal.
-You're a liar.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.800
I've seen her before.
She's not your girlfriend.

21:12.971 --> 21:14.598
Now, Olive, look, I'm sorry.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.071
Why is she wearing her underwear?

21:17.242 --> 21:19.107
Well, it's a style.

21:19.511 --> 21:21.376
Jerry, give me the keys.

21:22.414 --> 21:26.714
Well, I guess we're gonna go
for a drive now. She really loves that.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.477
You ever solve the riddle of the pie?

21:59.851 --> 22:02.046
No, that's one for the ages.

22:02.688 --> 22:06.681
But I think they're gonna put
Poppie away for a long, long time.

22:12.631 --> 22:13.996
You're not gonna believe this.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.657
I just got a letter
from a friend of mine in Chicago...

22:16.835 --> 22:20.965
...who was shopping, and she saw
a mannequin that looked just like me.

22:21.239 --> 22:25.073
What if there are more?
Where are they coming from?

22:27.679 --> 22:30.147
Ricky, we've been getting
a tremendous response...

22:30.315 --> 22:31.942
...to your TR-6 mannequin.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.584
TR-6?

22:35.854 --> 22:38.516
I prefer to think of her as...

22:39.057 --> 22:40.888
...Elaine.
