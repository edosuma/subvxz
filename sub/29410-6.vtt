10:38.507 --> 10:39.856
I promise.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.689
JESSICA:
We've missed you of late,
Ainsley.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.821
Where have you been?

10:47.864 --> 10:50.737
Working.
Researching a new subject.

10:50.780 --> 10:51.955
Lot of late nights.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.870
Oh, I hope
you're getting enough sleep.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.524
Ah. In other words, don't
turn out like your brother.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.658
What are you working on?

11:00.834 --> 11:03.488
I've decided to interview Dad.

11:03.532 --> 11:06.535
"The Surgeon: 20 Years Later."

11:07.536 --> 11:09.364
You must be joking.

11:09.407 --> 11:12.628
-Do I look like I'm joking?
-This is a bad idea, Ains.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.543
You're putting yourself
in his crosshairs.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.892
Why do you both do that?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.938
You treat me like
some delicate flower.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.940
And based
on billing hours alone,

11:19.983 --> 11:21.898
you guys are the basket cases.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.204
-I'm fine.
-JESSICA: Yes,

11:23.247 --> 11:25.946
because you are
the only one not seeing him.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.643
I have seen him.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.992
I went last week.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.516
What? Are you okay?

11:31.560 --> 11:34.781
-I just told you, I'm fine.
-None of this is fine.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.521
This is insane.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.654
[chuckles]:
An interview.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.788
I forbid it.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.094
You will not see
your father again.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.879
[laughs]:
What is that?

11:45.922 --> 11:48.751
A royal decree,
Mother hath spoken?

11:48.795 --> 11:51.972
I hoped we could have
a calm conversation about this,

11:52.015 --> 11:53.930
but obviously not.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.976
I'll see myself out.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.542
Ainsley, wait, we need...

11:57.586 --> 11:58.761
Let her go.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.594
That interview
will never happen.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.378
I will make sure of it.

12:08.379 --> 12:11.121
All right.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.819
Okay.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.342
Finally, we, uh...

12:14.385 --> 12:16.387
We agree?

12:16.431 --> 12:18.607
Well, I never.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.700
Still worrying
about your sister?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.224
Don't. I'm friends with
the chairman of her network.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.965
It'll only take a phone call.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.488
It's not that.

12:30.532 --> 12:31.838
What, then?

12:31.881 --> 12:33.970
Still lost in your past?

12:34.014 --> 12:36.016
[sighs]:
Oh, you know what they say:

12:36.059 --> 12:38.453
Those who can't remember
the past are condemned.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.456
That's not quite
the expression, dear.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.284
Close enough.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.939
Does this photo
mean anything to you?

12:47.854 --> 12:50.247
What is that hideous car?

12:50.291 --> 12:51.945
And where are you both?

12:51.988 --> 12:54.425
This was taken the week
before Dad was arrested.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.689
If I recall...

12:57.733 --> 12:59.474
[exhales]

12:59.517 --> 13:01.824
...I had gone with Ainsley
to the Hamptons,

13:01.868 --> 13:04.000
you were still in school, and...

13:04.044 --> 13:06.655
Martin was busy at work,
so he said.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.659
Makes sense, though.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.489
He lovedto camp.

13:14.532 --> 13:18.362
All the special clothes
and equipment.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.279
Made him giddy as a schoolboy.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.108
[sighs]

13:30.461 --> 13:32.724
Let me call Adolpho
to take you home.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.823
MARTIN:
Come on, what's with
the long face?

13:47.261 --> 13:48.697
Dad?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.046
[breath trembling]

13:50.090 --> 13:51.787
Wh-What is this?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.310
Don't be so worried.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.878
We're gonna have
a guy's weekend.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.011
I got us a car.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.621
The perfect camp.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.885
And Mother doesn't have to know.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.495
It'll be our little secret.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.889
[panting]

14:06.933 --> 14:07.890
[whispers]:
This isn't real.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.805
This isn't real.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.200
[distorted, echoing]:
Sound fun? Sound fun? Sound fun?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.898
[grunting]

14:17.944 --> 14:20.076
JESSICA:
Malcolm, oh, my God,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.905
-are you all right?
-I'm good. It's, uh...

14:22.949 --> 14:25.952
You don't have to worry.
I'm... I'm good.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.520
[panting]

14:29.564 --> 14:30.739
I'm good.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.571
I saw my little girl last week.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.488
She's asked to interview me.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.838
[chuckles]:
She really wants a...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.014
you know, relationship.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.583
With her dad.

14:48.626 --> 14:51.107
It felt wonderful.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.848
That's excellent, Martin,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.503
but I'd like to remind you
that today's group

14:55.546 --> 14:58.288
is about noticing each other's
signs of aggression.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.203
Oh, but I'm getting to that,
Stanley.

15:00.247 --> 15:04.077
Because I find that
I'm more prone to aggression

15:04.120 --> 15:08.951
when I'm grappling with
some kind of internal dilemma.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.171
-Such as now.
-I see.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.781
So on the one hand, uh,

15:12.824 --> 15:14.739
this interview
gives me the chance

15:14.783 --> 15:18.308
to finally spend some
quality time with my daughter...

15:18.352 --> 15:20.963
[takes deep breath]:
while on the other hand...

15:21.007 --> 15:25.402
there is a reason
why I've never discussed my...

15:27.187 --> 15:29.232
...exploits on camera.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.147
-And that is?
-Well, it's the same reason

15:31.191 --> 15:34.020
Vincent van Gogh went
to his grave a pauper.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.326
The general public...

15:36.370 --> 15:39.764
seldom understands greatness
in its time.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.418
Might there be another,
deeper reason

15:41.462 --> 15:42.985
you're reluctant to do this?

15:44.682 --> 15:47.033
The camera does add ten pounds.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.209
You crave control, Martin.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.993
Perhaps you're afraid

15:51.037 --> 15:53.561
to relinquish that
to your daughter?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.519
TEVIN [quietly]:
He should do it.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.349
Tevin, if you want
to participate,

15:59.393 --> 16:01.743
-you need to speak up.
-I said, he should do it.

16:02.831 --> 16:05.007
I wish I could've told my story.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.139
On TV.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.010
Set the record straight.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.012
-Why you killed your parents?
-Yeah.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.884
They were wicked.
Deviants both.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.365
They deserved what they got.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.628
People need to hear that.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.153
On TV.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.372
-Tell the camera everything!
-Hey, take it easy.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.809
-Easy. Let's go, Tevin.
-You have to do it!

16:24.853 --> 16:26.637
-Tell your story!
-Come on. [grunting]

16:26.681 --> 16:28.248
-Tell your story!
-Tevin, let's go.

16:28.291 --> 16:31.077
-Tevin, come on.
-Tell your story!

16:31.120 --> 16:32.643
-[latch clicks]
-Hey, maybe I'm wrong,

16:32.687 --> 16:35.429
but I think that was
Tevin's sign of aggression.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.435
♪

16:45.700 --> 16:47.223
Gil's on his way.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.095
[sighs]:
Thanks.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.401
Uh, hey, I need a favor.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.447
Can you run the license plates
in this photo?

16:53.490 --> 16:54.970
It's a partial.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.841
DANI:
And old.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.321
It'll take time.

16:58.365 --> 17:01.542
Should I ask what this is about,
or is knowing worse?

17:01.585 --> 17:03.239
The former.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.067
No. I mean, the latter.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.069
I always get those two mixed up.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.897
What's the profile, Bright?

17:08.940 --> 17:12.118
-Tell me about our sadist.
-Uh, okay.

17:12.161 --> 17:16.470
Your garden-variety sadist takes
pleasure from inflicting pain.

17:16.513 --> 17:20.126
On average, it takes three stabs
at a four-inch depth

17:20.169 --> 17:21.431
to kill someone.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.129
Where do you get a stat
like that?

17:23.172 --> 17:24.695
Our killer accelerated
his attack

17:24.739 --> 17:27.872
in order to deliver more strikes
before Gavin expired.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.657
What are the chances
this was a random murder?

17:29.700 --> 17:32.225
Unlikely. This began
as a murder of opportunity.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.227
Gavin's wife Crystal
certainly had motive.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.185
You know, they were
in the middle of a divorce.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.361
Computer checks show multiple
domestic incident reports.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.669
When unis showed up,
usually Gavin had the black eye.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.279
-She's a hitter.
-BRIGHT: But...

17:43.323 --> 17:45.281
she's very devoted to her son.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.283
She called him her "everything."

17:47.327 --> 17:48.589
That's what moms say.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.721
It's more than that.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.681
I think Crystal has
a Jocasta complex.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.118
It's the maternal version
of an Oedipal complex.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.467
Please tell me
they're not sleeping together.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.295
Not necessarily.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.558
A Jocasta mother emotionally
depends on their child

18:01.602 --> 18:03.256
like an adult partner,

18:03.299 --> 18:05.519
but they're not usually sadists.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.173
Enter Jake,

18:07.216 --> 18:09.305
Crystal's trainer and boyfriend.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.481
He has a history
of prior assaults.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.267
He even tried to kill a guy
in Bed-Stuy using Krav Maga.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.834
Israeli martial arts
will mess you up real good.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.054
Tell me...

18:19.098 --> 18:21.143
how will we know
if this guy's a sadist?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.753
[takes deep breath]

18:22.797 --> 18:25.321
I have an idea.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.715
Welcome to the world
of Krav Maga, Mr. Bright.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.412
How'd you hear about us?

18:29.456 --> 18:31.197
Saw a flier.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.376
I like your motto:
"We defend to the end."

18:36.419 --> 18:38.726
It's not a motto.

18:38.769 --> 18:41.207
It's a philosophy for survival.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.773
Cool.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.340
Got it.

18:44.384 --> 18:47.343
I've done, uh, kung fu,
jiu-jitsu.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.346
How do the belts work
in Grav Macau?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.218
Krav Maga...

18:52.261 --> 18:53.654
isn't a sport.

18:53.697 --> 18:56.265
The concept is to inflict
so much pain and damage

18:56.309 --> 18:58.833
that your opponent
can't hurt you ever again.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.269
Isn't that a little extreme?

19:01.227 --> 19:02.793
Life is extreme.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.882
Guys out there want
what you have--

19:04.926 --> 19:06.884
your money, your house.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.538
They'll take them, unless...

19:08.582 --> 19:10.627
-you're willing...
-To hurt them?

19:11.672 --> 19:13.108
[chuckles]

19:13.152 --> 19:15.371
Let me demonstrate.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.112
Show me some of that jiu-jitsu.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.244
Knock me down.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.203
[sniffs, clears throat]

19:27.253 --> 19:29.864
See that? Got your arm
in a submission hold.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.867
-Got it.
-See, Krav Maga...

19:32.910 --> 19:34.564
relies on one thing--

19:34.608 --> 19:37.176
maximum aggression.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.439
[grunts]

19:39.482 --> 19:42.006
Maybe this isn't your thing,
Mr. Bright.

19:42.050 --> 19:45.271
We do have a nice kung fu class
on Tuesdays.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.578
Ah, that's cool.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.927
Fine.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.148
What else you got?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.802
All right, then.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.673
I'm gonna come at you this time.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.591
What the hell?!

20:01.635 --> 20:05.378
Sorry. I-I thought we were going
for maximum aggression.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.379
[grunting]

20:06.422 --> 20:08.250
You want to see real aggression?

20:09.425 --> 20:11.427
-Do you submit?
-[strains]

20:13.908 --> 20:15.126
Do you?!

20:15.170 --> 20:16.563
[panting]

20:19.870 --> 20:21.220
[chuckles]

20:22.308 --> 20:24.875
What the hell?
You some kind of freak?

20:24.919 --> 20:26.486
[Bright groans]

20:26.529 --> 20:30.272
Well, Jung would have called me
a masochist.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.318
I'm not a fan.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.669
He would have loved you...

20:35.712 --> 20:37.671
an old-fashioned sadist.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.499
Who are you?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.979
Malcolm Bright.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.286
A profiler.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.245
And he's a cop.

20:47.507 --> 20:48.682
Hi, Jake.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.859
Let's talk.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.299
Didn't realize
I'd be running a marathon today.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.085
We're a quarter of a mile
from the crime scene.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.478
You'd think
she'd want to avoid it.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.132
JT:
Instead she's running

21:04.175 --> 21:06.308
-right into it.
-I'll follow.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.528
I'll try to head her off.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.094
I didn't kill Gavin.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.313
We pulled your records.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.533
Aggravated assault seems
to be your thing.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.448
Those are bar fights.
Punks popping off.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.928
I'm no killer. Or sadist.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.582
You definitely are.

21:19.626 --> 21:22.106
You got a massive endorphin rush
from nearly breaking my arm.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.544
Dilated pupils.
Flushed skin tone.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.373
For you,
hurting people feels good.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.331
You were also sleeping
with Gavin's ex.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.464
Do you offer that service
for all your clients?

21:31.507 --> 21:33.988
Yeah, I didn't see it
on the flier.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.515
This was east
of the crime scene.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.038
I think she's looking
for something.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.910
JT: Could be the knife
she stabbed Gavin with.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.738
-Maybe she ditched it
in the woods.
-Yeah.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.740
Better get CSU back down here.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.698
Have them expand
their search radius.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.397
Wait. She's digging.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.615
-Where are you?
-I'm a minute away.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.356
Okay, don't spook her.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.532
If she's tampering
with evidence, she might just...

21:58.055 --> 22:00.057
[exhales]:
I lost her.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.059
Crystal and I
are a casual thing.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.496
She got too much baggage,
anyway.

22:03.539 --> 22:04.584
What kind of baggage?

22:04.627 --> 22:07.587
[sighs]
Four months ago,

22:07.630 --> 22:10.590
Gavin demanded full custody
of Isaac.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.156
Drove Crystal nuts.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.984
[grunting]

22:15.464 --> 22:17.727
Every night,
she'd come in here, furious.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.034
I taught her
how to use that anger.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.340
What kind of thing
did you teach her?

22:22.602 --> 22:24.168
I taught her everything.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.474

22:44.580 --> 22:46.582
I'm good. I'm good.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.542
Found the buried treasure.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.587
One bloody sweatshirt.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.415
Perfect for a fall night

22:53.459 --> 22:56.200
and stabbing your husband
to death.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.072
Hands.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.770
Crystal Parker,
you're under arrest

23:00.814 --> 23:03.512
-on suspicion of murder.
-[coughs]

23:08.865 --> 23:10.824
It doesn't make sense, Gil.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.609
JT's checking with the lab

23:13.653 --> 23:15.045
about the blood
we pulled off the sweatshirt.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.438
Nice collar.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.791
She killed him, Bright.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.011
The profile doesn't fit.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.796
Crystal is a Jocasta mother,
not a sadist.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.581
Which means that she cares
about her son.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.800
If she thought
Gavin was taking him away,

23:30.844 --> 23:32.454
taking away her everything,

23:32.498 --> 23:33.586
she would kill to stop him.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.022
They found her
at the crime scene

23:35.065 --> 23:36.458
trying to destroy evidence.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.592
A Jocasta mother is too
emotionally consumed by her son

23:39.635 --> 23:42.595
to stab someone over
a hundred times for pleasure.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.466
Maybe it wasn't for pleasure.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.337
Maybe your profile is wrong.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.690
There is a kid involved.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.561
Almost the age you were when...

23:54.737 --> 23:57.914
I could see how
that could get into your head.

23:57.958 --> 24:00.134
Don't beat yourself up.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.441
Crystal didn't do it.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.489
Let's find out.

24:11.188 --> 24:14.757
GIL:
That's Gavin's blood
on the sweatshirt, isn't it?

24:16.193 --> 24:18.065
DNA doesn't lie, Crystal.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.719
That's your sweatshirt.

24:19.762 --> 24:22.461
You hid it up there in the woods
after it happened.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.466
You killed Gavin, didn't you?

24:30.599 --> 24:32.122
Yes.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.168
I did.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.522
Did what, exactly?

24:40.566 --> 24:42.568
I killed Gavin.

24:43.786 --> 24:46.485
I didn't plan to, but...

24:48.399 --> 24:50.358
...he was taking my son.

24:50.401 --> 24:52.621
I had to stop him.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.145
Take her back to holding.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.712
I'll call the D.A.
and Family Services.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.717
Let's go.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.726

I'm sorry, Bright.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.603
[sighs]

25:17.646 --> 25:19.518
I screwed up.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.695
You're a profiler,
not a psychic.

25:22.738 --> 25:24.697
You can't always know
who the killer is.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.787
No, not that.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.572
He's losing both of his parents,
and I told Isaac

25:30.616 --> 25:31.965
he was gonna be okay.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.706
I promised him.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.363
It's what you say to a kid.

25:39.407 --> 25:40.756
No.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.541
No, I lied to him.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.587
None of this is okay.

Ah, so this is how
we're gonna spend our day off.

More work.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.659

-Tiny.

What? I...

26:19.839 --> 26:21.667
I took your key.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.799
Well, it wasn't my only one.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.453
You must be freezing.

26:25.496 --> 26:26.497
I...

26:26.541 --> 26:28.499
Or maybe not.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.415

26:31.459 --> 26:33.113
Can I have the room, dear?

26:33.156 --> 26:34.418
[Jin exhales]

26:34.462 --> 26:36.638
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Whitly.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.642
[door closes]

26:40.686 --> 26:41.817
What's the emergency?

26:41.861 --> 26:43.863
And don't say
my interview with Dad,

26:43.906 --> 26:45.865
because I've already contacted
the prison

26:45.908 --> 26:46.866
and written all the questions.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.476
It's not happening.

26:48.519 --> 26:49.912
What?

26:49.956 --> 26:52.001
I called an old high school
flame, Thomas James,

26:52.045 --> 26:55.526
your boss's boss's boss,
and asked him to put the kibosh

26:55.570 --> 26:56.658
on the interview.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.007
You've got to be kidding me.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.226
It's for your own good.

26:59.269 --> 27:01.707
No. It's for yourown good.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.360
I don't know anything about him.

27:03.404 --> 27:06.059
Everything I know has been
colored by your resentment.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.844
Well, that
and all the people he killed.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.803
Well, yeah, but still.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.632
You made him out to be
just a monster.

Deep down,

27:21.117 --> 27:22.728
there's another question

27:22.771 --> 27:26.035
that you desperately need
answered.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.864
And I'm wondering...

27:28.908 --> 27:31.650
are you brave enough to ask it?

27:34.870 --> 27:36.698
Was it real?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.569
There's my girl.

27:38.613 --> 27:41.529
Did you love us, or was it
just some psychopathic act?

27:41.572 --> 27:44.880
I've thought about you

27:44.924 --> 27:48.536
every single day
since my arrest.

27:49.972 --> 27:53.062
I'd imagine myself there
on birthdays.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.848
Piano recitals.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.720
Dancing with you
at the debutante ball.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.548
I was never a debutante.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.551
That's a shame.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.554
The one I dreamed of you was...

28:06.597 --> 28:08.556
quite the party.

28:08.599 --> 28:11.167
You demanded
the band play "Single Ladies."

I get to be a father.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.587
how often I visit it.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.764
I will never forgive myself

28:42.808 --> 28:44.940
for not really being there.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.597
And neither should you.

so much better than me.

the monster.

to understand.

I want to see the best in him.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.275
That's a subconscious urge.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.974
I suppose. It's only natural.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.498
Yeah, sure.

I have an unconscious bias.
