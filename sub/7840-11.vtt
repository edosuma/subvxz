00:25.997 --> 00:30.418
Nothing beats taking a family drive
with our new satellite radio.

00:30.419 --> 00:33.886
Which of the 25
easy-listening stations
should we listen to?

00:33.887 --> 00:35.483
I say "Cool Waves."

00:35.821 --> 00:37.139
"Neon Breeze!"

00:37.140 --> 00:39.002
"Chill Thunder!"
"Chill Thunder!"

00:39.548 --> 00:41.317
You're all idiots.

00:41.318 --> 00:44.064
I'm putting it
on "Chill Thunder Lite."

00:45.156 --> 00:48.242
Oh, now that's smooth.

00:49.167 --> 00:52.490
Out of my way,
you seat belt-wearin' cowards!

00:52.493 --> 00:54.909
Hey! Nobody cuts me off!

00:57.229 --> 00:58.464
Homer, no!

00:58.464 --> 01:00.901
Revenge never solves anything.

01:00.919 --> 01:02.842
Then what's America
doing in Iraq?

01:02.848 --> 01:04.391
Well, let me tell you a story

01:04.397 --> 01:06.042
about a time revenge brought

01:06.048 --> 01:08.102
only unhappiness and misery.

01:08.117 --> 01:10.553
It happened
many years ago in Paris.

01:10.556 --> 01:11.483
Texas?

01:11.487 --> 01:13.251
No, France.

01:13.896 --> 01:16.542
There was a happy young family.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.410
Papa, may we
have chocolat?

01:20.415 --> 01:22.351
Papa, may we have
petit fours?

01:22.358 --> 01:24.043
May we? May we?

01:24.135 --> 01:25.743
Mais oui!

01:30.298 --> 01:32.222
Oh, mon cher,

01:32.227 --> 01:34.373
I am the luckiest wife
in the entire

01:34.377 --> 01:36.790
16th arrondissement!

01:36.798 --> 01:38.962
Let us kiss
with the tongues.

01:42.418 --> 01:43.861
I hate that Homer jerk

01:43.867 --> 01:45.090
with his beautiful wife

01:45.098 --> 01:46.341
and loving family,

01:46.347 --> 01:48.330
when all I got is this doorway.

01:48.867 --> 01:50.553
Well, enjoy your sensual

01:50.558 --> 01:52.110
tongue-play while you can

01:52.118 --> 01:54.470
'cause I've got a plan
to take everything you got!

02:05.025 --> 02:06.420
Monsieur Simpson.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.949
You're under arrest
for treason.

02:08.967 --> 02:10.963
Treason? But I love France.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.240
The way all our words
are either a girl or a guy.

02:13.248 --> 02:14.321
Oh, that's the best.

02:14.327 --> 02:16.611
Tell it to le baton!

02:19.845 --> 02:20.933
I don't want the kids

02:20.935 --> 02:22.240
to see me this way.

02:22.248 --> 02:23.352
Don't worry!

02:23.358 --> 02:25.642
They're still drunk from school.

02:27.045 --> 02:31.190
Uh... deux... trois.

02:35.967 --> 02:37.370
Listen to this
letter he wrote.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.060
"Dear England,

02:39.067 --> 02:40.110
"how I love your

02:40.115 --> 02:41.400
moors and heaths.

02:41.417 --> 02:42.363
"For you, I'd do

02:42.365 --> 02:43.660
whatever it takes,

02:43.846 --> 02:46.250
especially treason."

02:46.255 --> 02:47.672
I didn't write that!

02:47.678 --> 02:49.503
Even if I did love England,

02:49.506 --> 02:51.422
I'd play it cool.

02:51.536 --> 02:53.610
Wait for it to come to me.

02:53.617 --> 02:55.403
I sentence you to life.

02:55.408 --> 02:57.893
You moron! I'm already alive.

02:57.896 --> 02:58.721
In prison.

03:11.326 --> 03:12.473
I'm gonna stop now.

03:17.718 --> 03:19.061
I shouldn't be here.

03:19.065 --> 03:20.331
I was framed.

03:20.336 --> 03:21.800
You think you
got problems?

03:21.818 --> 03:23.420
The man in the
iron mask over there

03:23.425 --> 03:24.763
is the rightful
King of France.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.320
Hey, wait,
did you guys hear that?

03:26.328 --> 03:28.113
He just admitted it. Guys?

03:28.298 --> 03:30.513
Oh, man, this place
is so unfair.

03:30.717 --> 03:32.591
Are you going to torture me?

03:32.595 --> 03:33.742
We can't tell you.

03:33.745 --> 03:34.680
Not knowing is

03:34.685 --> 03:36.342
the worst torture of all.

03:36.346 --> 03:37.861
Well, that and
the rat helmet.

03:41.348 --> 03:42.740
Now get some sleep.

03:42.745 --> 03:44.761
You've got a 9:00 a.m.
rat helmet.

03:45.075 --> 03:47.020
Oh, 9:00 a.m.

03:52.237 --> 03:54.500
I swear revenge on Meaux!

03:54.505 --> 03:55.812
Even if it takes me

03:55.818 --> 03:57.513
the rest of my life!

03:57.517 --> 03:58.390
Can you loosen my arms

03:58.396 --> 03:59.562
so I can shake my fists?

03:59.567 --> 04:00.523
You're the traitor.

04:01.095 --> 04:03.133
Revenge!

04:03.296 --> 04:03.810
Okay.

04:04.255 --> 04:04.901
Thank you.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.492
Oh, little mouse.

04:09.496 --> 04:10.883
You are the only thing

04:10.885 --> 04:12.740
that keeps me sane.

04:15.076 --> 04:17.113
Now I have nothing.

04:17.118 --> 04:18.149
Perhaps

04:18.156 --> 04:19.380
I may be of help.

04:19.387 --> 04:21.403
Where did you come from?

04:21.408 --> 04:22.790
I'm your cell mate.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.542
You never noticed me
because frankly,

04:24.545 --> 04:26.360
you're extremely self-centered.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.110
Oh, sorry, I wasn't listening.

04:28.115 --> 04:29.663
I was checking out my reflection

04:29.666 --> 04:30.942
in this yellow water.

04:30.948 --> 04:33.570
Ho-ho-ho-ho, looking good.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.420
Young man, I have the answer

04:35.427 --> 04:36.701
to your problems.

04:40.975 --> 04:43.442
I spent 30 years
digging this tunnel,

04:43.448 --> 04:45.312
but now I can't use it.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.431
I'm simply too old.

04:47.436 --> 04:48.583
And decrepit.

04:49.508 --> 04:50.983
But you can escape

04:50.998 --> 04:52.373
and use this map
to retrieve

04:52.388 --> 04:53.830
my buried treasure.

04:53.838 --> 04:56.350
With it you can
have your revenge.

04:56.356 --> 04:58.110
Ooh, the-the!

04:58.118 --> 05:00.651
But why are you helping me?

05:00.656 --> 05:02.350
Well, because before

05:02.355 --> 05:03.311
my wretched life

05:03.316 --> 05:04.540
comes to a close,

05:04.547 --> 05:05.813
I want to know that

05:05.816 --> 05:07.811
I had one friend.

05:07.816 --> 05:09.450
Also, because while you slept,

05:09.455 --> 05:11.292
I violated you repeatedly.

05:11.297 --> 05:13.310
So this map leads
to a treasure, huh?

05:15.896 --> 05:17.520
I wonder how long
this tunnel

05:17.525 --> 05:19.082
...iiiiiiiis!

05:28.017 --> 05:29.253
D'oh!

05:40.517 --> 05:42.240
Damn it!

05:47.307 --> 05:49.240
How's it going?

05:49.795 --> 05:50.721
D'oh!

05:52.495 --> 05:54.182
Uh-huh. Hmm.

05:56.047 --> 05:56.952
Mon Dieu!

06:01.266 --> 06:03.541
Whoo-hoo-hee!

06:05.496 --> 06:07.070
Ew! Silver.

06:07.795 --> 06:08.762
Ooh, a penny.

06:08.766 --> 06:10.723
This is my lucky day!

06:18.258 --> 06:21.910
Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

06:21.918 --> 06:25.333
Dormez-vous, dormez-vous

06:25.336 --> 06:26.950
Oh, I love today's music.

06:26.957 --> 06:29.111
Frère this, and Jacques that.

06:29.117 --> 06:29.791
Out of sight.

06:32.907 --> 06:34.551
"The Count of Monte Cristo

06:34.567 --> 06:36.700
invites you to a formal gala."

06:36.718 --> 06:39.472
Ooh, the Count of Monte Cristo!

06:41.106 --> 06:41.881
Can we go?

06:41.886 --> 06:42.550
We haven't been

06:42.553 --> 06:43.399
to any parties

06:43.399 --> 06:44.414
since that soirie

06:44.414 --> 06:45.691
at the Bastille.

06:45.879 --> 06:46.443
Ah...

06:46.448 --> 06:47.642
summer nights.

06:51.135 --> 06:52.912
When will we meet
the count?

06:52.918 --> 06:53.990
Do you think
he'll like us?

06:53.995 --> 06:55.551
I've heard rumors
he's mysterious.

07:07.785 --> 07:09.883
Madame, you have the shapely,

07:09.886 --> 07:11.750
hairless knuckles of a queen.

07:12.158 --> 07:13.473
Oh. Well.

07:13.478 --> 07:14.802
Monsieur Meaux,

07:14.805 --> 07:15.520
I would be honored

07:15.525 --> 07:16.950
if you would be the first

07:16.958 --> 07:19.773
to enjoy the evening's
entertainment.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.561
Here it is:

07:21.995 --> 07:23.323
the harmless chair

07:23.335 --> 07:24.630
of relaxation.

07:25.406 --> 07:26.871
I heard about these things.

07:26.878 --> 07:28.463
They're good for
doing the wife, right?

07:28.518 --> 07:29.283
Oh!

07:29.457 --> 07:30.460
Little do you know

07:30.468 --> 07:31.632
that the Count of Monte Cristo

07:31.646 --> 07:32.412
is in fact

07:32.417 --> 07:34.761
an old acquaintance of yours.

07:35.227 --> 07:35.760
Ma?

07:36.277 --> 07:38.741
I have returned!

07:38.748 --> 07:40.320
I don't get it.

07:40.677 --> 07:41.561
Oh, hold on.

07:42.615 --> 07:43.371
It's him!

07:43.377 --> 07:44.400
Monsieur Simpson!

07:44.406 --> 07:46.150
Homer, you're back!

07:46.158 --> 07:48.073
Oui, oui! And I have spent

07:48.075 --> 07:49.931
the last five years
plotting the most

07:49.936 --> 07:51.750
exquisite revenge!

08:03.516 --> 08:05.021
Okay, lesson learned.

08:05.035 --> 08:06.030
Friends again?

08:09.856 --> 08:10.562
Crjpes?

08:12.836 --> 08:13.613
Suzette!

08:20.147 --> 08:21.080
Homer?

08:21.335 --> 08:22.703
Yes, my love?

08:22.717 --> 08:24.981
You killed
my husband.

08:26.128 --> 08:27.161
No!

08:27.168 --> 08:28.223
Papa Meaux!

08:28.238 --> 08:29.040
Papa Meaux!

08:29.046 --> 08:30.682
You guys liked him?

08:30.976 --> 08:33.610
We were together
for five years.

08:33.618 --> 08:36.041
Now who's going
to take care of the triplets?

08:40.558 --> 08:41.640
But Marge,

08:41.645 --> 08:43.412
I did it all for you.

08:43.417 --> 08:44.423
For me, huh?

08:44.437 --> 08:46.040
What took you so long?

08:46.046 --> 08:47.062
It takes time

08:47.066 --> 08:48.560
to make a revenge machine

08:48.568 --> 08:49.553
this awesome.

08:49.557 --> 08:50.491
Plus, in the middle,

08:50.496 --> 08:51.560
I had to take revenge

08:51.566 --> 08:52.941
on some of my contractors.

08:52.957 --> 08:54.722
You spent so much time

08:54.725 --> 08:56.262
plotting your revenge,

08:56.268 --> 08:57.383
you lost everything

08:57.386 --> 08:58.672
that really mattered.

08:58.676 --> 08:59.961
Come on, kids.

09:03.678 --> 09:05.263
So you see, Homer,

09:05.265 --> 09:07.943
revenge only leads to misery.

09:11.857 --> 09:13.200
Weren't you listening?

09:13.207 --> 09:14.733
I just told you a whole story

09:14.736 --> 09:16.172
about revenge.

09:16.178 --> 09:17.340
Oh right.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.643
Revenge!

09:22.686 --> 09:25.451
I'm gonna get my revenge,
and if I get caught,

09:25.527 --> 09:28.041
I'm pinning it on the baby
like the time I shot Mr. Burns.

09:28.087 --> 09:28.880
Dad, wait.

09:28.937 --> 09:31.202
I've got a story
about why revenge is wrong.

09:31.507 --> 09:34.623
Is it The Count of Monte Cristo?
'Cause I love that story.

09:34.666 --> 09:35.520
No.

09:36.237 --> 09:38.693
I call it
Revenge of the Geeks.

09:46.007 --> 09:48.131
I'm so sick of those bullies.

09:48.206 --> 09:50.661
We got to figure out
some way to stop 'em.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.433
Perhaps we could tell
the principal.

09:52.457 --> 09:53.453
Tell me what?

09:58.405 --> 10:01.152
Behold the Get-back-inator.

10:02.528 --> 10:04.961
We're gonna beat those bullies
with a glove?

10:05.167 --> 10:07.842
This is far more than a mere glove.

10:07.847 --> 10:12.111
This is the turning point in the
eternal battle of brain v. brawn.

10:12.115 --> 10:15.952
All it requires is
a small amount of coordination.

10:18.508 --> 10:22.842
I can handle the glove.
I took juggling at camp.

10:27.707 --> 10:29.291
Good morning, dinguses.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.981
What are you doing,
touching each other's butts?

10:32.087 --> 10:35.150
Oh, you are so dead
you're alive.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.350
What is this place?

10:46.208 --> 10:49.243
Ah, what a pleasant surprise.

10:49.307 --> 10:52.721
It seems that now
the shoe is on the other...

10:52.727 --> 10:53.720
Revenge!

11:02.708 --> 11:04.030
My fun bags!

11:05.007 --> 11:06.762
Please, have mercy!

11:06.846 --> 11:08.902
I always thought
you were the coolest dork.

11:19.606 --> 11:20.802
Stop hitting yourself.

11:21.508 --> 11:22.922
Stop hitting yourself.

11:23.025 --> 11:24.501
Stop hitting yourself.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.173
Why are you hitting yourself?

11:30.308 --> 11:33.681
Milhouse, thanks to you,
the nerds can breathe easy.

11:33.807 --> 11:36.450
Except the ones with asthma,
which is all of them.

11:36.455 --> 11:38.000
But still, it's great.

11:38.306 --> 11:42.621
Yup, having a weapon at school
has really made things awesome.

11:45.358 --> 11:46.022
Pardon my birdie.

11:46.225 --> 11:48.253
I misjudged the prevailing winds.

11:48.305 --> 11:50.630
You embarrassed me
in front of Lisa!

11:59.656 --> 12:01.630
Milhouse, what's gotten into you?

12:01.686 --> 12:04.403
Over the years,
a lot of people have hurt me.

12:04.458 --> 12:07.003
Good thing I kept this list.

12:09.825 --> 12:11.930
Oh, no, you've already
got your revenge!

12:12.106 --> 12:15.190
You wouldn't give me
Chinese cuts in the lunch line.

12:15.297 --> 12:19.332
You laughed when I threw up
on the glass-blowing tour.

12:19.835 --> 12:21.442
Girls like you better.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.973
Your parents are married!

12:25.877 --> 12:27.403
Ay caramba!

12:28.546 --> 12:31.402
That's the only line I get
in your stupid story?!

12:31.456 --> 12:34.183
There are no small parts,
just small actors.

12:37.666 --> 12:39.603
This is my first day
at this school.

12:39.757 --> 12:41.322
I haven't done anything to you!

12:41.326 --> 12:44.152
You will.
This is prevenge.

12:50.355 --> 12:52.071
Why, look, it's Milhouse.

12:52.176 --> 12:53.742
What's the power glove for?

12:53.806 --> 12:57.002
Opening the cup on
your weirdo pills?

13:01.095 --> 13:02.471
Willie, clean up this mess.

13:02.576 --> 13:03.670
All right.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.222
Milhouse, don't you see?

13:10.287 --> 13:11.842
You're addicted to revenge.

13:11.985 --> 13:14.502
You'll learn to love it
when you're my queen.

13:15.186 --> 13:16.042
I see.

13:17.346 --> 13:19.760
While it would be an honor
to be your queen...

13:20.167 --> 13:21.761
Go on.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.943
...I feel it would be best
if we just stay friends.

13:25.145 --> 13:27.743
Nobody spares my feelings!

13:31.905 --> 13:33.363
I can't do it.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.580
I can't hurt you, Lisa.

13:41.636 --> 13:44.181
You forgot about me
'cause I had the mumps.

13:53.808 --> 13:56.720
That had what I really
like in a story:

13:56.928 --> 13:58.323
an ending.

13:58.428 --> 14:01.180
The point, Dad,
is that when you take revenge,

14:01.325 --> 14:04.121
you become just as bad
as the person you harm.

14:04.326 --> 14:08.833
No, sweetie, the lesson is: 
never put down your weapon.

14:09.235 --> 14:12.002
Revenge!

14:14.387 --> 14:15.823
Look at that view.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.843
It reminds me of how insignificant
we are in the world.

14:20.047 --> 14:21.242
Yeehaw!

14:22.636 --> 14:24.051
This is it.

14:24.255 --> 14:25.931
It's taken all day.

14:26.037 --> 14:31.002
We've missed our flight to Hawaii,
but finally I'll get my revenge.

14:31.707 --> 14:32.603
Dad, wait!

14:32.708 --> 14:34.752
- You haven't heard my story.
- You?

14:35.005 --> 14:36.601
You're too dumb to tell a story.

14:38.406 --> 14:42.583
No, seriously, you're great.
Let's hear it. Oh, geez.

14:42.686 --> 14:46.702
My story takes place
in a time I call the past.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.803
That stunk worse
than boiled cabbage.

15:07.905 --> 15:09.002
You should feel lucky.

15:09.207 --> 15:11.401
Not many boys have
parents who can afford

15:11.507 --> 15:13.400
to take them to the
opera every night.

15:13.506 --> 15:16.540
Parents who are still alive,
I might add.

15:19.006 --> 15:21.160
Hmm, well, this alley
looks dangerous.

15:21.366 --> 15:22.773
I better turn my ring around.

15:24.706 --> 15:25.602
Oh, boy.

15:28.358 --> 15:29.660
Hand over your wallet.

15:30.308 --> 15:31.220
You don't frighten me!

15:32.455 --> 15:33.250
Or my wife!

15:34.675 --> 15:36.552
- Or my...
- Shut up.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.503
Avenge me.

15:44.607 --> 15:48.151
In flamboyant,
impractical fashion.

16:02.208 --> 16:04.731
I want to avenge you,
but I don't know how.

16:04.935 --> 16:07.242
- With my help.
- Grandpa?

16:07.287 --> 16:10.830
In my younger days,
I was an ace crime fighter.

16:10.935 --> 16:12.951
The "Crimson Cockatoo."

16:15.606 --> 16:18.732
Now let's get you in shape
in an old-timey way.

16:35.306 --> 16:36.833
Holy Hannah!

16:36.936 --> 16:39.070
I've got more muscles
than a New England clam bank.

16:39.178 --> 16:41.201
Now all I need
is a superhero name.

16:41.407 --> 16:43.902
You can be the
Crimson Cockaboy.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.801
- Hmm?
- I'll keep thinking.

16:51.508 --> 16:52.652
Help! Somebody help!

16:52.656 --> 16:56.041
That thief stole all my Heralds,
Tribunes, and Herald-Tribunes.

16:57.807 --> 17:01.643
-A k-k-k-kid!
- I'm Bart-Man.

17:06.707 --> 17:08.082
Thank you, masked vigilante.

17:08.285 --> 17:10.881
Your overzealous homicide
has saved me 80 cents.

17:10.984 --> 17:13.733
Now, if you're not going to buy
anything, please move along.

17:19.407 --> 17:20.400
Tonight, the Springfield...

17:20.405 --> 17:22.053
I mean Gotham underworld
is trembling

17:22.107 --> 17:24.252
while solid citizens sleep
snug as a bug.

17:24.257 --> 17:26.849
Why? Because Bart-Man
is knocking down bad guys

17:26.906 --> 17:28.770
like Howard Hughes 
knocks up young starlets!

17:28.846 --> 17:30.231
Bad guys like
The Toker...

17:32.655 --> 17:33.450
The Diddler...

17:35.688 --> 17:36.480
Mr. Mole...

17:37.465 --> 17:38.471
Sugar and Spice.

17:41.008 --> 17:42.103
And Poison Lenny.

17:46.877 --> 17:48.063
No snake tattoo.

17:49.745 --> 17:52.153
When will I find the man
who murdered my parents?

17:52.355 --> 17:53.353
W hen?

17:53.455 --> 17:54.653
Attention, Bart-Man.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.741
This is The Serpent,
saying "fangs a lot"

17:57.855 --> 17:59.751
for getting rid
of the competish.

17:59.858 --> 18:01.800
More stuff for me to steal!

18:03.308 --> 18:05.153
No villain is safe from me,
Serpent!

18:05.278 --> 18:08.401
But I'm not a villain.
I'm a transvestite.

18:08.607 --> 18:10.030
Explain that to your maker.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.200
I'll take it from here,
Bart-Man.

18:28.306 --> 18:29.653
No sign of
the Serpent, Chief.

18:29.805 --> 18:31.450
Everything's work
with you. Lighten up.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.902
That music--
it's so hypnotic.

18:39.407 --> 18:41.840
My bone has a mind of its own.

18:45.506 --> 18:48.872
I'll be snaking those jewels
and venom gonna go.

18:48.978 --> 18:51.321
Sorry I didn't asp
your permission.

18:51.387 --> 18:53.432
Hope that's cobracetic.

18:53.636 --> 18:55.730
Hey, jerk,
puns are lazy writing.

18:55.836 --> 18:56.632
D'oh!

19:01.457 --> 19:03.603
Party's over, Serpent!

19:03.607 --> 19:05.453
No kidding because
you're standing in the dip.

19:20.806 --> 19:21.632
You!

19:21.738 --> 19:23.350
You're the man
who killed my parents!

19:29.645 --> 19:30.641
I did it.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.200
I finally got my revenge.

19:32.257 --> 19:33.783
But it didn't bring
your parents back.

19:33.888 --> 19:35.651
Tell me, big boy,
was it really worth it?

19:35.657 --> 19:38.180
Well, I do feel a little better.

19:38.186 --> 19:41.340
Plus, I got zillions of dollars
and no parents to tell me what to do.

19:42.505 --> 19:44.842
Bart-Man, don't you want to join us?

19:44.845 --> 19:46.720
Don't talk to me
when I'm vibrating.

19:49.308 --> 19:52.402
So you see, revenge is great,
and there's three ways

19:52.507 --> 19:53.500
to talk about it.

19:53.508 --> 19:56.350
Although two of the ways
were kind of the same way,

19:56.558 --> 19:59.823
and even the third one might have
worked better as a Halloween story.

20:00.807 --> 20:01.831
That's okay, boy.

20:01.936 --> 20:03.672
The two of us got to talking.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.571
Yeah, turns out we have
a lot in common.

20:06.778 --> 20:08.303
We're both from Connecticut.

20:10.007 --> 20:11.531
Look at all them stars.

20:11.738 --> 20:14.040
How many do you think there are?

20:14.446 --> 20:15.980
- Two.
- What the...

20:16.286 --> 20:18.800
Two? You think
there are two...

20:19.007 --> 20:21.372
Well, I never.
How could you...?

20:22.848 --> 20:24.750
Why do you think
it is that mankind

20:24.956 --> 20:27.553
is so inclined towards
hating one another?

20:27.958 --> 20:28.931
I don't know.

20:29.638 --> 20:32.400
Let's just lay here
till we figure it out.
