WEBVTT

00:02.653 --> 00:04.329
Sheldon, your food's
getting cold.

00:04.331 --> 00:05.747
I'll eat later.

00:05.749 --> 00:06.949
Right now, I'm suckling

00:06.951 --> 00:09.284
at the informative bosom
of mother physics.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.154
It's hot when
Sheldon talks dirty.

00:14.991 --> 00:18.427
So, I found this Web site
where you send them pictures,

00:18.429 --> 00:19.594
they sculpt your head

00:19.596 --> 00:21.596
and make an action figure
out of you.

00:21.598 --> 00:22.597
How awesome is that?

00:22.599 --> 00:23.715
Oh, let me see.

00:23.717 --> 00:24.800
Yeah, you can pick
your wardrobe.

00:24.802 --> 00:26.468
You can even choose
your accessories.

00:26.470 --> 00:27.636
(chuckles)

00:27.638 --> 00:31.473
Leonard, you can get
a little asthma inhaler.

00:32.442 --> 00:33.775
Oh, this is neat.

00:33.777 --> 00:35.310
Think about all
the action figures

00:35.312 --> 00:36.511
we've bought over the years.

00:36.513 --> 00:39.281
It would be kind of cool
to have ones that look like us.

00:39.283 --> 00:40.515
Don't you think?

00:43.369 --> 00:45.237
Yeah, if that's your idea
of what's cool,

00:45.239 --> 00:47.188
you should get one.

00:47.190 --> 00:49.541
Yeah, so, I'm out.

00:50.860 --> 00:52.244
What do you think,
Sheldon?

00:52.246 --> 00:54.162
Want an action figure
that looks just like you?

00:54.164 --> 00:56.064
Would it come with kung-fu grip?

00:56.066 --> 00:57.432
No.

00:57.434 --> 00:59.584
Don't waste my time.

01:00.803 --> 01:03.672
You get that these are
personalize action figures.

01:03.674 --> 01:06.008
Honey, if you want one,
just get one.

01:06.010 --> 01:07.309
You're still
out, right?

01:07.311 --> 01:09.394
Yep.

01:38.997 --> 01:41.282
A hush falls over the crowd

01:41.284 --> 01:44.902
as Cooper studies the board.

01:44.904 --> 01:47.071
He makes his move.

01:47.073 --> 01:48.506
He's dividing both sides by "I."

01:48.508 --> 01:50.424
He's adding back
the coefficient.

01:50.426 --> 01:51.759
He has a value for "P."

01:51.761 --> 01:53.077
He's plugging that back in.

01:53.079 --> 01:54.045
He takes the derivative,

01:54.047 --> 01:55.179
and he solves the equation.

01:55.181 --> 01:56.297
The crowd goes wild.

01:56.299 --> 01:57.398
Nobel! Nobel!

01:57.400 --> 01:59.934
Cooper?

01:59.936 --> 02:01.018
Nobel.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.186
Kripke.

02:03.488 --> 02:05.806
Don't look at my board.

02:07.109 --> 02:09.026
What's that?

02:09.027 --> 02:11.479
That's a drawing
of a really cool train.

02:11.481 --> 02:12.847
Don't look at that, either.

02:12.849 --> 02:14.098
What do you want?

02:14.100 --> 02:15.733
I have some
bad news.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.118
You're working
on a grant proposal

02:17.120 --> 02:18.569
for a new
fusion reactor.

02:18.571 --> 02:21.539
I'm working on a grant proposal
for a new fusion reactor.

02:21.541 --> 02:25.126
The university is only allowed
to submit one proposal.

02:25.128 --> 02:27.895
So they asked you to pack up
your things and ship out.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.297
That's hard cheese, Barry.

02:29.299 --> 02:30.898
You're one of the good ones.

02:31.783 --> 02:35.836
No, they're making us
work together.

02:35.838 --> 02:38.389
That's ridiculous.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.675
I am one of the great minds
of our generation.

02:40.677 --> 02:42.843
I work on a level so rarified

02:42.845 --> 02:44.312
you couldn't
even imagine it.

02:44.314 --> 02:47.565
I said stop looking
at my cool train!

02:49.735 --> 02:50.735
Hmm.

02:50.737 --> 02:51.802
Kind of a strange place

02:51.804 --> 02:53.487
to put a picture of you
and Bernadette.

02:53.489 --> 02:58.526
Well, I wanted everybody
to know I love my wife.

02:58.528 --> 03:01.812
And nobody to know I forgot
to turn off the laser.

03:06.134 --> 03:07.234
They're here.

03:07.236 --> 03:08.953
Our action figures
have arrived.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.488
This is the best $500
I've ever spent.

03:11.490 --> 03:13.374
$1,000 on action figures?

03:13.376 --> 03:15.209
How can you afford that?

03:15.211 --> 03:16.660
Easy-- his family's loaded,

03:16.662 --> 03:18.662
and Bernadette has a great job.

03:18.664 --> 03:21.498
My wife came with both
fun bags and money bags.

03:22.718 --> 03:27.138
Say hello to an exact
scale model of me.

03:32.311 --> 03:35.730
Oh, I'm not dark chocolate.

03:35.732 --> 03:38.616
I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.

03:39.484 --> 03:42.403
Oh, man.

03:45.874 --> 03:48.859
Look at my nose.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.661
Maybe it's a shipping problem.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.296
What?
Yeah.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.748
Maybe Wesley Snipes
and Toucan Sam

03:53.750 --> 03:56.033
just got action figures
that look like you guys.

03:58.470 --> 03:59.703
This sucks.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.389
I can't believe
I wasted all that money.

04:01.391 --> 04:04.558
Aw, and my girlfriend
wouldn't let me get one.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.843
(Leonard chuckles)

04:05.845 --> 04:07.862
Look at my face.

04:07.864 --> 04:10.214
Do I look smug?
I feel smug.

04:13.001 --> 04:15.987
I hate it when you make me
sit through all the credits.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.105
Well, sometimes there's
a secret ending,

04:18.107 --> 04:19.824
like in <i>The Avengers.</i>

04:19.826 --> 04:21.742
Yeah, but I don't think
that's going to happen

04:21.744 --> 04:24.412
in a documentary
about the Holocaust.

04:25.664 --> 04:27.615
They could
show bloopers.

04:27.617 --> 04:30.451
(Darth Vader's theme music
from <i>Star Wars</i> playing)

04:30.453 --> 04:31.568
Oh, no.

04:31.570 --> 04:32.670
What is that?

04:32.672 --> 04:34.171
That is Sheldon's

04:34.173 --> 04:38.125
"I'm unhappy and about
to destroy the planet" music.

04:38.127 --> 04:40.261
Come on, let's just go
to your place.

04:40.263 --> 04:42.413
Well, wait, if he's unhappy,
shouldn't we talk to him?

04:42.415 --> 04:43.464
"Shouldn't we talk to him?"

04:43.466 --> 04:46.017
Have you learned nothing
in six years?

04:52.324 --> 04:54.191
You doing okay, sweetie?

04:57.179 --> 04:59.113
There is ominous music playing,

04:59.115 --> 05:01.315
and there is an afghan
over my head.

05:01.317 --> 05:02.717
I don't know where you're from,

05:02.719 --> 05:04.952
but where I'm from,
that means I'm not doing okay.

05:05.821 --> 05:07.955
Want me to make
you some tea?

05:07.957 --> 05:10.224
Tea is for when I'm upset.
I'm not upset.

05:10.226 --> 05:13.110
The university's forcing me
to work with Kripke.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.611
I'm outraged.

05:14.613 --> 05:17.214
So, cocoa?

05:17.216 --> 05:18.782
Yes, cocoa.

05:20.752 --> 05:23.454
Do you have any idea what
it's like to be paired

05:23.456 --> 05:25.756
with someone who's so
incredibly annoying?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.008
Oh, teacher! Me! Me!

05:30.829 --> 05:32.296
See, I did all this great work,

05:32.298 --> 05:34.565
and now he's just going to
come along and ruin it.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.734
I am angrier than ever
and filled with despair.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.153
What beverage
do you make for that?

05:39.155 --> 05:41.939
Oh... no, no, no, I know this.

05:41.941 --> 05:43.124
Uh...

05:43.126 --> 05:44.575
hot apple cider
with cinnamon sticks?

05:44.577 --> 05:46.994
Yes, hot apple cider
with cinnamon sticks!

05:51.883 --> 05:53.984
What the frig, Cooper?

05:53.986 --> 05:54.952
We were
supposed to meet

05:54.954 --> 05:57.321
in my office
a half an hour ago.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.673
And yet,
now you're in my office.

05:59.675 --> 06:02.159
Point: Cooper.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.512
Welcome to the Thunderdome,
Kripke.

06:04.514 --> 06:07.681
We agreed to exchange
copies of our work.

06:07.683 --> 06:08.766
Let me see yours.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.936
Why don't you show me
yours first.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.972
You think I just fell
off the turnip truck?

06:16.191 --> 06:17.858
We exchange at the same time.

06:17.860 --> 06:20.628
How do I know you're not
going to take my ideas

06:20.630 --> 06:22.163
and publish them
as your own?

06:22.165 --> 06:24.064
How do I know you're not
going to do that with mine?

06:24.066 --> 06:25.182
Yeah, because I'm not interested

06:25.184 --> 06:26.867
in getting published
in <i>Mad</i> magazine.

06:29.070 --> 06:31.956
Zingers fly fast
in the Thunderdome, Barry.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.792
Are we going
to do this or not?

06:34.794 --> 06:36.327
Thank you.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.212
So, we read each other's work,
meet again tomorrow?

06:38.214 --> 06:40.364
Fine.

06:43.585 --> 06:46.220
Nice try.
This is blank paper.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.222
And I am sure it's
still more valuable

06:48.224 --> 06:49.706
than whatever's in here.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.593
Cough it up, Cooper.

06:52.595 --> 06:54.145
Very well.

06:59.184 --> 07:02.987
If this one's blank, too,
I'm going to be furious.

07:04.789 --> 07:06.323
Fine.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:15.367 --> 07:16.734
You!

07:16.736 --> 07:19.003
Always bet on black.

07:19.005 --> 07:22.173
Get that waste of money
out of my face.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.924
It's only a
waste of money

07:23.926 --> 07:26.210
if we don't
play with them.

07:26.212 --> 07:27.744
He's right, dawg.

07:29.598 --> 07:31.048
Please, I'm working.

07:31.050 --> 07:34.385
You know, there is a way
we can get action figures

07:34.387 --> 07:35.936
to look exactly
like us.

07:35.938 --> 07:37.104
Oh, yeah?
How's that?

07:37.106 --> 07:38.189
Two words:

07:38.191 --> 07:40.357
3-D printer.

07:40.359 --> 07:41.942
Wait, maybe it's three words.

07:41.944 --> 07:43.394
No, hang on.

07:43.396 --> 07:46.697
Okay, one word, a letter
and a number and...

07:46.699 --> 07:48.232
maybe a hyphen.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.401
3-D printer.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.737
I have always wanted
a 3-D printer.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.122
Of course you have.

07:55.124 --> 07:56.240
They're an
engineer's dream.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.374
Anything you can design,

07:57.376 --> 07:59.610
a 3-D printer can make
out of plastic.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.912
Yeah, but they're so expensive.

08:01.914 --> 08:02.963
Oh, come on.

08:02.965 --> 08:04.048
You deserve one.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.499
You've worked hard
to find a woman

08:05.501 --> 08:07.051
who makes a lot of money.

08:09.087 --> 08:11.455
Well, the prices
have been coming down.

08:11.457 --> 08:12.623
Oh, true.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.758
They're practically
giving them away.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.745
You know, in exchange for money.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.797
And we can make stuff
we need for work with it.

08:20.799 --> 08:23.434
Prototypes
of my CAD/CAM designs,

08:23.436 --> 08:24.518
specialized tools...

08:24.520 --> 08:26.320
Not to mention
Malibu Koothrappali

08:26.322 --> 08:29.607
and his totally bitchin'
dream house.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.808
We don't need Malibu
Koothrappali's dream house.

08:32.811 --> 08:34.193
Really, smart guy?

08:34.196 --> 08:36.746
Where's he supposed to park
his sweet little Corvette?

08:39.034 --> 08:43.486
The monkey in my tobacco study
has taken to smoking a pipe.

08:43.489 --> 08:46.823
I'm supposed to remove
his brain to examine,

08:46.825 --> 08:49.677
but it's hard because now he
reminds me of my uncle.

08:52.297 --> 08:54.014
You've been
awfully quiet tonight.

08:54.016 --> 08:55.332
Is everything okay?

08:55.334 --> 08:57.601
I'm fine.

08:57.603 --> 09:00.387
All right, well,
how was work today?

09:00.389 --> 09:02.640
Did you exchange your research
with Kripke?

09:04.476 --> 09:06.360
Yes.

09:06.362 --> 09:08.845
Sheldon, what's going on?

09:10.231 --> 09:14.184
I read his research, and...

09:14.186 --> 09:17.521
it's leaps and bounds
ahead of mine.

09:17.523 --> 09:20.541
Which means the mommy
of the smartest physicist

09:20.543 --> 09:25.629
at the university is not
my mommy as I had thought.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.548
It's his mommy.

09:28.967 --> 09:31.135
Sheldon, I wish there was
something I could do

09:31.137 --> 09:32.636
to make you feel better.

09:34.255 --> 09:36.006
May I offer you a consoling hug?

09:37.208 --> 09:38.726
What do we have to lose?

09:45.433 --> 09:48.268
How's that?

09:48.270 --> 09:51.221
I feel like I'm being strangled
by a boa constrictor.

09:54.192 --> 09:57.027
Why'd you stop?

10:05.461 --> 10:08.796
Come on, Sheldon!
We're going to be late!

10:08.798 --> 10:11.682
I can't go in today.
I'm sick.

10:11.684 --> 10:12.784
You're not sick.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.001
You just don't want
to face Kripke.

10:14.003 --> 10:16.487
No, look.

10:18.190 --> 10:22.026
128.

10:23.695 --> 10:25.513
See?

10:25.515 --> 10:27.815
What did you do,
put this in your tea?

10:27.817 --> 10:29.700
Oh, dear.

10:29.702 --> 10:32.787
Now I'm not even smarter
than you.

10:32.789 --> 10:35.289
Sheldon, Kripke's not
smarter than you.

10:35.291 --> 10:37.041
You just got stuck
on a wrong path.

10:37.043 --> 10:38.276
Happened to Einstein.

10:38.278 --> 10:40.912
He got stuck on the unified
field theory for decades.

10:40.914 --> 10:42.863
Oh, don't play
the Einstein card.

10:42.865 --> 10:45.133
His great breakthroughs happened
when no one knew anything.

10:45.135 --> 10:47.635
So everything
was a great breakthrough.

10:47.637 --> 10:48.920
Sheldon Lee Cooper,

10:48.922 --> 10:50.638
I do not have time
for this nonsense.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.757
Now, go put your clothes on,
get in the car,

10:52.759 --> 10:54.342
and lets go to work.

10:55.210 --> 10:58.096
All right, geez.

10:58.098 --> 10:59.647
What a grouch.

11:02.551 --> 11:03.935
How did I do that?

11:03.937 --> 11:06.687
I got to remember
how I did that.

11:07.773 --> 11:10.158
Do you realize, by
owning a 3-D printer,

11:10.160 --> 11:13.077
we are reclaiming
the manufacturing process

11:13.079 --> 11:16.998
and taking jobs back
from sweatshops in China?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.401
I think this thing
was made in China.

11:21.236 --> 11:23.254
Eh, what can you do?

11:23.256 --> 11:25.923
Ooh, I-I think it's done.

11:27.176 --> 11:28.576
(gasps)

11:28.578 --> 11:29.760
It worked!

11:29.762 --> 11:32.763
We printed a whistle.

11:33.632 --> 11:35.216
Amazing.

11:35.218 --> 11:37.251
You realize these things
go for 25 cents a pop

11:37.253 --> 11:38.419
at a party store.

11:38.421 --> 11:40.721
And we made it
in only three hours.

11:40.723 --> 11:42.056
(whistles)

11:42.058 --> 11:43.141
(inhales)

11:43.143 --> 11:45.393
Sounds just like
store-bought.

11:46.395 --> 11:50.264
Okay, give me
a superhero pose,

11:50.266 --> 11:51.532
and I will scan you

11:51.534 --> 11:53.234
into the computer
for your action figure.

11:53.236 --> 11:54.318
(inhales)

11:54.320 --> 11:56.070
Oh, I wish I was
in better shape.

11:56.072 --> 11:57.038
(laughs)

11:58.540 --> 11:59.824
Stop holding
your stomach in.

11:59.826 --> 12:02.776
I'll give you a six-pack
with the computer.

12:02.778 --> 12:04.162
Oh, okay, great.

12:04.164 --> 12:06.497
Now I can look
like Val Kilmer as Batman

12:06.499 --> 12:09.283
instead of Val Kilmer
as he looks today.

12:09.285 --> 12:11.919
(exhales)

12:11.921 --> 12:14.472
All right, you can
suck it in a little bit.

12:17.809 --> 12:19.727
Cooper, we have a problem.

12:19.729 --> 12:21.479
Your work is really not

12:21.481 --> 12:23.514
at a level
I expected it to be.

12:23.516 --> 12:25.349
I know.

12:25.351 --> 12:26.934
Go ahead, mock me.

12:26.936 --> 12:29.904
Just use small words
so I understand.

12:30.772 --> 12:32.156
Don't play dumb
with me.

12:32.158 --> 12:34.075
We both know
what your problem is.

12:34.077 --> 12:35.676
We do?

12:35.678 --> 12:37.328
You have a girlfriend.

12:37.330 --> 12:38.979
So?

12:38.981 --> 12:40.915
So my work would suffer, too,

12:40.917 --> 12:44.252
if I was getting laid
all the time.

12:48.524 --> 12:50.258
Yes.

12:51.743 --> 12:53.945
That is the reason.

12:55.180 --> 12:58.516
My work is suffering
because of...

12:58.518 --> 13:00.935
all the laid I'm getting.

13:02.938 --> 13:05.022
You lucky bastard.

13:05.024 --> 13:07.558
What can I say, you know?

13:07.560 --> 13:10.177
She enjoys my genitals.

13:11.980 --> 13:14.699
I am giving them to her
on a nightly basis.

13:15.651 --> 13:18.069
Okay, stop bragging.

13:18.071 --> 13:20.238
You had some brilliant
insights in here,

13:20.240 --> 13:21.455
but if we're gonna
make this work,

13:21.457 --> 13:23.324
you need to buckle down
and focus.

13:23.326 --> 13:24.875
I'll do what I can.

13:24.877 --> 13:28.246
But it's not going to be easy,
because when I'm with Amy

13:28.248 --> 13:32.149
and our bathing suit areas
mush together...

13:32.151 --> 13:34.635
boy howdy, is it magic

13:41.827 --> 13:44.895
Oh, good,
you're home.

13:44.897 --> 13:47.131
Got a little
surprise for you.

13:47.133 --> 13:48.316
What?

13:48.318 --> 13:49.400
Say hello

13:49.402 --> 13:51.569
to my little friend.

13:54.072 --> 13:57.391
Oh, my God.

13:57.393 --> 13:58.743
That's so cute.

13:58.745 --> 14:01.562
I didn't think there could be
a smaller version of you.

14:01.564 --> 14:03.197
(laughs)

14:04.065 --> 14:05.750
I know, right?

14:05.752 --> 14:07.568
And, thanks
to photographs

14:07.570 --> 14:09.170
and a little
3-D modeling,

14:09.172 --> 14:11.872
here comes the bride.

14:12.674 --> 14:14.959
Oh, Howie,
I love these.

14:14.961 --> 14:15.960
I thought you might.

14:15.962 --> 14:17.678
Were they expensive?

14:17.680 --> 14:19.213
Didn't cost a thing.
I made them myself.

14:19.215 --> 14:20.765
How?
Koothrappali and I

14:20.767 --> 14:24.385
bought a used 3-D printer
for $5,000.

14:24.387 --> 14:25.469
(chuckles)

14:25.471 --> 14:27.921
$5,000 for a
couple of dolls?

14:27.923 --> 14:30.090
Are you out
of your mind?

14:30.925 --> 14:33.594
Not just
a couple of dolls.

14:33.596 --> 14:36.230
For as many dolls
as we want.

14:37.733 --> 14:40.234
And whistles.

14:40.236 --> 14:43.237
At any point, did it dawn
on you to talk to me

14:43.239 --> 14:45.039
about spending this
kind of money?

14:45.941 --> 14:48.109
It's kind of
dawning on me now.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.128
I don't believe you!

14:51.130 --> 14:54.131
Howie, we can't afford to waste
money on junk like this.

14:54.133 --> 14:56.083
What are you talking about?

14:56.085 --> 14:57.752
We make plenty
of money.

14:57.754 --> 14:59.053
<i>I</i> make plenty of money!

14:59.055 --> 15:00.954
You make peanuts!

15:00.956 --> 15:04.342
Yes, but we're married now.

15:04.344 --> 15:05.926
That means, when you

15:05.928 --> 15:08.679
get sick,
I take care of you.

15:08.681 --> 15:11.515
And when you make
a bunch of money,

15:11.517 --> 15:13.801
I get to buy stuff.

15:14.653 --> 15:17.154
Sorry if you
don't like it,

15:17.156 --> 15:19.824
but that's how
love works.

15:19.826 --> 15:22.476
No, here's how
love works.

15:22.478 --> 15:24.028
You're gonna return
the machine,

15:24.030 --> 15:26.364
or you can print out a
working set of lady parts

15:26.366 --> 15:27.815
and sleep with those.

15:29.868 --> 15:32.420
Oh, my God! Are you
actually thinking about it?

15:36.007 --> 15:37.324
All right, I don't understand.

15:37.326 --> 15:39.176
Why didn't you just
tell Kripke the truth?

15:39.178 --> 15:41.879
Because the truth
made me look bad,

15:41.881 --> 15:44.832
whereas a ridiculous bald-faced
lie makes me look good.

15:45.717 --> 15:46.717
Anyway,

15:46.719 --> 15:48.001
if Kripke asks,

15:48.003 --> 15:50.388
tell him my coitus with Amy
is frequent,

15:50.390 --> 15:53.407
intense and whimsically
inventive.

15:59.698 --> 16:02.283
Is my coitus
whimsically inventive?

16:03.235 --> 16:05.369
That is what I write
on the bathroom walls.

16:05.371 --> 16:07.121
"For a whimsically
inventive time,

16:07.123 --> 16:08.322
call Leonard Hofstadter."

16:08.324 --> 16:10.157
(laughs)

16:11.526 --> 16:13.461
I know you're joking,
but I'd be okay with that.

16:13.486 --> 16:14.877
Yeah.

16:15.630 --> 16:17.214
Sheldon, can I ask you
a question?

16:17.216 --> 16:19.333
Of course.
You ever going to sleep with Amy?

16:22.671 --> 16:24.271
That's awfully personal.

16:24.273 --> 16:25.840
We don't ask Sheldon
things like that.

16:25.842 --> 16:27.040
Maybe you don't; I do.

16:27.042 --> 16:28.208
What's the deal?

16:29.411 --> 16:31.879
Well, word around the university

16:31.881 --> 16:35.116
is I'm giving her sex organs
a proper jostling.

16:35.118 --> 16:36.767
All right, come on,
be serious.

16:36.769 --> 16:39.019
Look, you guys have been
going out a long time.

16:39.021 --> 16:40.488
She would clearly like

16:40.490 --> 16:42.239
to have a physical
relationship with you,

16:42.241 --> 16:43.858
so what are you doing?

16:43.860 --> 16:45.392
All right, we're down
the rabbit hole.

16:45.394 --> 16:47.027
What <i>are</i> you doing?

16:47.029 --> 16:50.698
Well, first of all,
I'm quite fond of Amy.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.199
Then what's
the problem?

16:52.201 --> 16:54.351
Penny...

16:54.353 --> 16:57.705
all my life,
I have been uncomfortable

16:57.707 --> 16:59.423
with the sort
of physical contact

16:59.425 --> 17:01.509
that comes easily
to others--

17:01.511 --> 17:04.145
hand-shaking, hugging,

17:04.146 --> 17:06.046
prostate exams.

17:09.851 --> 17:12.269
But I'm working on it,
you know?

17:12.271 --> 17:16.440
Just recently, I had to put
VapoRub on Amy's chest.

17:16.442 --> 17:19.143
A year ago, that would
have been unthinkable.

17:19.145 --> 17:22.730
Now you know how I feel
when I have to put it on you.

17:23.949 --> 17:25.950
Okay. Hang on.

17:25.952 --> 17:28.903
Are you saying someday
you and Amy might...

17:28.905 --> 17:32.289
actually get physical?

17:35.026 --> 17:36.610
It's a possibility.

17:39.464 --> 17:41.448
(quietly):
Oh, my God!

17:48.122 --> 17:49.673
Sheldon, I know this
wasn't easy for you,

17:49.675 --> 17:51.559
and I'm really glad we could
have this conversation.

17:51.561 --> 17:52.810
Oh, yeah.

17:53.795 --> 17:54.962
Ow!

18:04.228 --> 18:06.180
Are you sure you
want to do this?

18:06.182 --> 18:08.182
Give up your half
of the 3-D printer?

18:08.184 --> 18:09.517
Yes.

18:09.519 --> 18:11.803
And can you please make
that out to Bernadette?

18:11.805 --> 18:13.638
I was taken off
the joint account

18:13.640 --> 18:17.025
until I learn
the value of money.

18:18.561 --> 18:19.944
Wow, that's harsh.

18:19.946 --> 18:22.046
Tell me about it.

18:22.048 --> 18:24.115
(sighs)
Aren't you gonna eat lunch?

18:24.117 --> 18:28.102
Nah, I blew my food allowance
on Pokémon cards.

18:30.439 --> 18:34.092
Well, the equation
balances,

18:34.094 --> 18:35.827
but it's certainly
not elegant.

18:35.829 --> 18:37.945
Whatever.
You get any last night?

18:40.549 --> 18:42.133
Yes.

18:42.135 --> 18:44.552
Gave it to her good, huh?

18:45.387 --> 18:48.139
No, I gave it to her well.

18:50.626 --> 18:52.627
Now, over here,
I was thinking

18:52.629 --> 18:54.596
the turbulence could be
reduced if we just put...

18:54.598 --> 18:55.663
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:55.665 --> 18:58.650
Was she naked,
or was she wearing lingerie?

19:01.754 --> 19:03.438
I didn't notice.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.807
How could you
not notice?

19:06.809 --> 19:08.409
I was too busy

19:08.411 --> 19:11.479
squishing all the desirable
parts of her body.

19:11.481 --> 19:13.698
Ah, you're killing me, Cooper!

19:15.117 --> 19:17.001
Can we get back to work?

19:17.003 --> 19:19.754
Sure, sure, sure.

19:20.589 --> 19:22.457
You guys ever use any toys?

19:24.627 --> 19:26.160
Toys?

19:27.463 --> 19:30.765
I do have a model rocket
next to my bed.

19:30.767 --> 19:33.772
A rocket?
You're a freak! I love it!
