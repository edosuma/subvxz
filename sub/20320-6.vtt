WEBVTT

00:02.965 --> 00:05.566
And The Turkish Tornado!
Make it a hat trick. Shooting!

00:05.633 --> 00:07.134
Oh, nice save!

00:07.202 --> 00:09.222
Turkish Tornado.
That's... I like that.

00:09.342 --> 00:13.474
- Hold on a second.
- What's going on? You all right?

00:13.541 --> 00:14.731
No, I thought it was Sandy.

00:14.851 --> 00:19.012
It's this gymnast that broke her leg that
we brought in. She keeps emailing me.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.480
They like a man in uniform.

00:20.547 --> 00:22.181
OK, this is her.

00:22.249 --> 00:24.357
She sent that
to you on purpose?

00:24.477 --> 00:27.012
Yeah. You know what this is?
It's 'eau de commitment", OK.

00:27.125 --> 00:28.825
I have the stink of
un-attainability on me and these

00:28.893 --> 00:30.460
women are just
coming out of the woodwork.

00:30.528 --> 00:33.463
You're a free man. I thought
Sandy left things kinda open?

00:33.531 --> 00:36.498
Well, actually, I told Sandy that I
would be here when she gets back.

00:36.566 --> 00:38.934
So I would like to be the kind
of guy that sticks to his word.

00:39.002 --> 00:41.203
Yeah, we all would, man.
I mean, but are you?

00:41.271 --> 00:44.473
Yeah, I guess I'm taking advice now
from the king of self-imposed solitude?

00:44.541 --> 00:46.341
All right. Fair enough.

00:46.409 --> 00:49.145
- You can, uh...
- Hey, guys!

00:49.212 --> 00:51.546
- Elyse.
- Hey.

00:51.613 --> 00:53.982
Toby, this is Elyse.
I trained her last year.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.151
- Really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:56.218 --> 00:57.518
I didn't know you guys
have a team. Do you mind?

00:57.586 --> 00:59.554
- You wanna play, yeah sure?
- Yeah, thanks.

00:59.621 --> 01:03.191
- What are you doing here?
- Rider said I should come in and set up my locker.

01:03.258 --> 01:06.260
- Thank you for leaving OZ without a partner.
- Yeah, you got my old job.

01:06.328 --> 01:09.229
- Good for you.
- I did. I'm totally stoked.

01:09.297 --> 01:10.597
Wow.

01:10.665 --> 01:12.532
- Congratulations.
- How are you? Huh?

01:12.600 --> 01:13.834
How's, uh... how's Sandy?

01:13.902 --> 01:15.869
Sandy.

01:15.937 --> 01:18.505
Sandy is in Africa.

01:18.573 --> 01:20.340
- Yes.
- She's in Africa?

01:20.408 --> 01:22.209
- Yeah.
- No way! That's amazing.

01:22.276 --> 01:25.344
Yes. Mrs. Africa.

01:25.412 --> 01:28.047
So, uh...
you wanna play?

01:28.115 --> 01:29.415
Uh.

01:29.482 --> 01:31.350
Go ahead. Could be fun.

01:31.418 --> 01:32.952
You know, actually,
we should get back to work.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.154
Yeah. That's enough kidding
around for one day, guys. OK.

01:35.222 --> 01:38.124
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, you know it's a... it's a...

01:38.192 --> 01:41.626
Careful about that. It's just
been a lot of goofing around.

01:41.694 --> 01:43.895
- Does he want to play?
- Nah, he's gotta come with me.

01:43.963 --> 01:47.733
So we gotta get back to work, guys.
C'mon! Time. People to save.

(Telephone ringing)

02:13.724 --> 02:15.291
Hello.

02:15.359 --> 02:16.626
<i>Mom?</i>

02:16.693 --> 02:18.561
Blaire?

02:18.629 --> 02:20.263
Mom. Hi.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.966
- Hi. I'm sorry. Did I wake you?
<i>- No. No.</i>

02:23.033 --> 02:27.202
It, uh... I'm just...
I'm just surprised, that's all.

02:27.270 --> 02:29.204
<i>How are you?</i>
<i>Is everything OK?</i>

02:29.272 --> 02:32.141
Well, actually, I was
wondering if I could come home.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.708
Like tonight.

02:33.777 --> 02:39.648
Yes. Of course you
can come home, honey.

02:39.715 --> 02:41.449
<i>Where are you?</i>

02:41.517 --> 02:43.117
I'm... I'm at a bus stop.

02:43.185 --> 02:45.219
I don't know when
the next bus is coming.

02:45.287 --> 02:48.222
I want you to stay
where you are, OK?

02:48.290 --> 02:50.258
<i>I want to come</i>
<i>and pick you up, OK?</i>

02:50.325 --> 02:52.526
<i>So just... I want you</i>
<i>to tell me where.</i>

02:52.594 --> 02:54.495
<i>Blaire?</i>

02:54.562 --> 02:55.863
Blaire?

02:55.931 --> 02:57.865
<i>Hi. Sorry.</i>
<i>Sorry. No, I'm here.</i>

02:57.933 --> 03:01.201
I'm at the community centre
at Steeles and Mississauga.

03:01.269 --> 03:04.037
<i>OK. Listen. I'm gonna</i>
<i>be there in 20 minutes.</i>

03:04.105 --> 03:07.073
I want you to stay put.
I want you to go inside.

03:07.141 --> 03:08.508
<i>OK, honey? I'm on my way.</i>

03:08.575 --> 03:10.210
Really?

03:10.278 --> 03:12.179
Thanks, Mom.

03:12.246 --> 03:16.748
Hey, Mom. I love you.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.653
<i>Blaire?</i>

03:21.721 --> 03:24.456

03:35.732 --> 03:37.600
<i>And I told her</i>
<i>I would come and get her.</i>

03:37.668 --> 03:40.170
<i>I told her to stay put.</i>
<i>I get there and she's gone.</i>

03:40.237 --> 03:43.273
<i>She's just vanished. And I
know exactly where she is.</i>

03:43.341 --> 03:46.109
The police know exactly where--

03:46.177 --> 03:48.944
- So, uh, got your
message. What's going on?

03:49.012 --> 03:51.947
Hope you got some sleep.
That would make one of us.

03:52.015 --> 03:53.815
The Crown Attorney wants

03:53.883 --> 03:55.784
our unit to take over
a Metro investigation.

03:55.852 --> 03:58.854
Very high profile.
Top priority. Starting now.

03:58.921 --> 04:01.090
Welcome to Special Assignments.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.657
Three girls have gone missing

04:02.725 --> 04:04.625
from the same bus stop
in the last three weeks.

04:04.693 --> 04:06.995
They were last heard
from between 8 and 10pm.

04:07.062 --> 04:10.098
From a phone booth. No other
evidence. No known witnesses.

04:10.165 --> 04:13.401
Same age.
Same time. Same place.

04:13.469 --> 04:15.703
This is normally a case
for the Sex Crimes Unit,

04:15.770 --> 04:18.473
- but they messed up.
- Metro was overzealous

04:18.540 --> 04:20.440
in their hunt for the
first two missing women.

04:20.507 --> 04:24.077
They target a local organization
called The Heart of Artemis.

04:24.145 --> 04:26.779
Oh, Artemis. Yeah,
the cult. I know them.

04:26.847 --> 04:30.183
- Please, don't use the "C" word.
- New religious organizations.

04:30.251 --> 04:32.986
Like a church, or a mosque,
or the local scapegoat.

04:33.054 --> 04:35.922
Local police were convinced
that the first two victims,

04:35.990 --> 04:38.924
who are not members of Artemis,
were being held inside.

04:38.992 --> 04:41.494
Uh, yeah. Artemis sued
for police harassment.

04:41.561 --> 04:45.431
The latest victim, Blaire
Donleavy, now, she is a member.

04:45.499 --> 04:47.332
So if the predator is
from Artemis,

04:47.400 --> 04:49.767
why would he abduct somebody
from where he lives?

04:49.835 --> 04:51.802
Well, we have to assume
that these women were

04:51.870 --> 04:53.738
at the wrong place
at the right time.

04:53.805 --> 04:55.240
But, as it stands right now,

04:55.307 --> 04:57.342
our predator has
a six-hour head-start on us.

04:57.410 --> 04:59.444
I need you two to talk
to Blaire's mother and then

04:59.512 --> 05:01.146
focus on viable suspects.

05:01.213 --> 05:05.049
Dev's already at the scene
talking to potential witnesses.

05:05.116 --> 05:07.017
Something was wrong.

05:07.085 --> 05:08.752
I could feel it.

05:08.819 --> 05:12.989
A mother can sense these things.
It's like a sixth sense.

05:13.058 --> 05:15.825
And you're sure
Blaire was by herself?

05:15.893 --> 05:18.661
She didn't mention
anyone or any problems?

05:18.728 --> 05:20.763
No! She wanted to come home.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.933
Don't you understand?
She wanted out of that cult.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.669
For two years she wouldn't even
<i>speak to me.</i>

05:26.736 --> 05:29.105
Were the two of you close
when she joined Artemis?

05:29.173 --> 05:30.806
Are you asking me how
I could have let her

05:30.874 --> 05:32.375
get mixed up with those people?

05:32.443 --> 05:35.977
My daughter and I had our
problems. Of course we did.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.580
But loving each other
was never one of them.

05:38.647 --> 05:41.749
- We're not judging anyone, Mary.
- Well, maybe you should.

05:41.817 --> 05:45.454
And maybe you should start
with that guru, Mitch Deerfoot.

05:45.521 --> 05:46.988
He's got a past.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.524
And I'm convinced he's got
all of those girls in there.

05:49.592 --> 05:51.992
- Have you met him before?
- Are you kidding me?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.395
The families are
completely banned.

05:54.463 --> 05:57.998
He convinces these kids that
everything outside is toxic.

05:58.066 --> 06:02.035
Including their mothers.
I am begging you. Please...

06:02.104 --> 06:04.405
You have got to get
my daughter out of there.

06:09.210 --> 06:13.679
Mitch Deerfoot. Ex-philosophy professor
and founder of The Heart of Artemis.

06:13.747 --> 06:17.016
He was charged 10 years ago for allegedly
slipping a college girl a roofie.

06:17.084 --> 06:20.253
It was dismissed for lack of evidence.
The local community's been

06:20.321 --> 06:23.555
trying to get them outta there ever since.
He set it up about five years back.

06:23.623 --> 06:27.392
- Is there anyone else in the local sex offender registry?
- Yeah. I definitely got a fit.

06:27.460 --> 06:30.895
This guy. P.J. Martin.
Convicted serial rapist.

06:30.963 --> 06:33.798
He used to stalk women
and rape them at knifepoint.

06:33.866 --> 06:36.935
He lives near Artemis
and he also works from home.

06:37.003 --> 06:39.870
OK, well, Toby and I will
go talk to Deerfoot and Martin.

06:39.938 --> 06:42.006
OK, canvasses are up.
Public warnings are out.

06:42.073 --> 06:44.575
I'll recheck with the bus drivers and
all the women's known associates.

06:44.643 --> 06:48.312
You might wanna leave your cell phone
in the car when you get to Artemis.

06:48.380 --> 06:52.183
They believe that all
modern technology is unclean.

06:52.251 --> 06:54.417
[Crowd]: Go home!
Cult go home!

06:54.485 --> 06:56.019
Hey, don't forget your phone.

06:58.456 --> 07:00.957
- [Crowd]: Cult go home!
- Excuse me.

07:01.025 --> 07:03.293
- Excuse me, please. Excuse me.
- Let her through.

07:03.361 --> 07:06.163
IIB. We're here
to see Mr. Deerfoot.

07:53.608 --> 07:56.310
- You've got an aura.
- Excuse me?

07:56.377 --> 07:57.811
It's nice.

07:57.878 --> 08:01.414
Artemis is a sanctuary.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.617
We're about returning
to a more natural,

08:04.685 --> 08:06.652
humane way of life.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.756
We value purity
of heart, mind, of spirit...

08:10.824 --> 08:12.858
which we believe to be eternal.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.960
So we take care of ourselves

08:16.028 --> 08:19.598
by living modestly,
cleansing constantly.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.934
We take vows of chastity
and of abstinence.

08:23.001 --> 08:27.038
We don't want anything
to do with a toxic modern world.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.307
And so visitors,
the outside world, are what?

08:29.375 --> 08:31.308
- They're contaminants?
- Distractions.

08:31.409 --> 08:34.645
We do work on neighbouring
farms for food.

08:34.712 --> 08:38.014
May I offer you
anything? Tea?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.982
- No.
- No thanks.

08:40.051 --> 08:41.784
You're afraid what's in it?

08:41.852 --> 08:44.521
(Chuckles)
You're sure you wouldn't like

08:44.589 --> 08:46.489
your legal team
present, Mr. Deerfoot?

08:46.557 --> 08:48.891
I've never broken the law.

08:48.959 --> 08:53.396
I did break a very vindictive
woman's heart 10 years ago.

08:53.497 --> 08:55.531
It seems
I'm still paying for it.

08:55.599 --> 08:57.933
So sexual assault
isn't serious to you?

08:58.001 --> 09:01.404
This conversation is about
finding our beloved Blaire.

09:01.472 --> 09:04.306
You know she planned on leaving
Artemis last night to go home?

09:04.374 --> 09:06.441
I wished her well.

09:06.509 --> 09:08.477
Then I went to bed.

09:22.857 --> 09:24.792
You had no problem
with Blaire leaving?

09:24.859 --> 09:26.994
No. We're all free to go.

09:27.061 --> 09:29.229
We don't kidnap new members.

09:29.298 --> 09:31.799
We aren't holding
the missing outsiders.

09:31.866 --> 09:33.867
Your neighbours
feel differently.

09:33.935 --> 09:36.969
We gathered that when they
tried to burn the place down.

09:37.037 --> 09:38.305
Twice.

09:38.372 --> 09:42.676
Nina? Nina and Ben.
They worked with Blaire.

09:42.743 --> 09:45.712
- They'll tell you about the outsiders.
- We've all been harassed.

09:45.780 --> 09:47.414
Sworn at.

09:47.481 --> 09:50.416
But lately there's a man in
a car. He takes pictures of us.

09:50.483 --> 09:52.083
Especially the women.

09:52.151 --> 09:53.652
He watches them.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.422
[Nina]: <i>He follows us</i>
<i>everywhere we go.</i>

09:59.659 --> 10:03.195
- Have you reported this to the police?
- Uh, yeah. Nothing happened.

10:03.262 --> 10:08.032
We just assumed he was one of yours. You
know, sent to spy, satisfy the prejudiced.

10:08.099 --> 10:11.369
Who, if they would just take the time to know
us, they would understand that we're pacifists.

10:11.437 --> 10:13.237
We loathe violence. In any form.

10:13.305 --> 10:16.040
Well, that guy
gives me the creeps.

10:16.107 --> 10:18.376
He's sincere.
Ben, Nina, all the others.

10:18.444 --> 10:20.144
No one contradicts
anything he said.

10:20.212 --> 10:22.412
Devoted followers
make great alibis.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.415
I mean this stalker they were talking
about seems pretty convenient.

10:25.483 --> 10:28.785
- No, he's real. They've all seen him.
- I'll get Dev to check into it.

10:28.853 --> 10:30.920
Remind me about this next
guy, the... the rapist.

10:30.988 --> 10:32.789
Right. P.J. Martin.

10:32.857 --> 10:35.091
He's convicted of three
sexual assaults at knifepoint.

10:35.159 --> 10:38.394
He got out of jail a few
months ago. Lives alone, nearby.

10:38.462 --> 10:40.730
Well, sexual assault
often goes unreported.

10:40.797 --> 10:44.032
- These three girls could just be the beginning.
- Oh, boy.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.935
- Imagine how many phone calls you missed?
- [Crowd]: Cult go home!

10:47.003 --> 10:49.137
Can you let us out?

10:53.643 --> 10:56.244
(Twigs snapping)

11:09.892 --> 11:11.825
Help me! Help me!
Please help me!

11:11.893 --> 11:15.729
(Gasping)
Please help me! Please help me!

11:19.805 --> 11:22.061
(Ambulance siren)

11:22.402 --> 11:24.817
So, apparently she tried
to refuse treatment.

11:24.923 --> 11:26.891
She told the cops she wanted
to be taken back to Artemis.

11:26.959 --> 11:28.959
- Did someone call her mother?
- Yeah, she refused that too.

11:29.026 --> 11:31.595
Right now we need to talk
to Blaire. She's our only chance

11:31.662 --> 11:34.831
- of getting these girls back.
- One problem: that's not Blaire.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.595
Let me find out
who this girl is.

11:39.770 --> 11:42.906
Um, it was just after nine.

11:42.974 --> 11:44.773
Last night?

11:44.841 --> 11:46.896
No. This morning.

11:47.364 --> 11:50.346
Near McKay farm.
I walk their horses.

11:50.414 --> 11:52.315
It's my daily offering to Artemis.

11:52.382 --> 11:54.584
- You were there alone?
- Yeah.

11:54.651 --> 11:59.693
Um... I was late for morning
reflections. So I was running.

11:59.933 --> 12:01.856
He must have hit me in the head.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.392
Knocked me out and...

12:04.865 --> 12:08.668
Ugh. I woke up in this gross
sack in the back of some truck.

12:08.736 --> 12:11.604
You know... I had
no idea where I was.

12:11.672 --> 12:15.341
Did you get a look at him,
or did he say anything to you?

12:15.409 --> 12:17.509
Fawn, we think that he did this

12:17.577 --> 12:20.913
to someone else from Artemis:
Blaire Donleavy.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.882
No. Blaire went
home to her mom's.

12:28.254 --> 12:29.888
She went to her mom's, right?

12:29.956 --> 12:32.990
Blaire went missing waiting
for her mom to come pick her up.

12:33.058 --> 12:35.192
What?

12:35.260 --> 12:38.195
OK, what's the last thing
that you can remember?

12:38.263 --> 12:41.699
Um... Uh...

12:41.767 --> 12:43.868
Some man's shadow.

12:43.936 --> 12:45.803
I don't know.

12:45.871 --> 12:49.005
No! How many times? How many
times do I have to tell you?

12:49.073 --> 12:52.676
You're sure
he didn't say anything?

12:52.743 --> 12:54.678
What about the truck?

12:54.745 --> 12:58.314
It was a brown pickup.

12:58.382 --> 13:01.718
And it... it stank.
Like vinegar.

13:01.786 --> 13:03.652
And...

13:03.720 --> 13:06.488
Look, I don't know
where I was. I just ran.

13:06.556 --> 13:07.756
OK.

13:07.824 --> 13:10.192
Tell me you saw more
about this truck.

13:10.259 --> 13:13.161
No. I saw a man
beating her up.

13:13.229 --> 13:15.798
But the injuries
don't match what I saw.

13:15.865 --> 13:19.001
Daytime abduction nowhere near the
bus stop doesn't fit our M.O.

13:19.069 --> 13:21.803
(Beep)
Dev has a lead on the truck.

13:21.870 --> 13:26.074
- Guess who owns one? P.J. Martin.
- Our serial rapist.

13:32.781 --> 13:35.216
No engine.

13:35.283 --> 13:37.918
My nephew's
never-ending project.

13:37.986 --> 13:40.253
Thinks this piece
of junk is a classic.

13:40.321 --> 13:44.825
I use the grey car in the driveway.
You can check that out too.

13:44.892 --> 13:47.761
Where were you
at 9am this morning?

13:47.829 --> 13:50.563
I'm counsellor
at a halfway house in Parkdale.

13:50.632 --> 13:52.632
Fellow sex offenders.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.800
I signed in at 6am.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.937
- And last night between eight and midnight?
- My son's birthday.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.471
It was at his mother's.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.573
Do you recognize
either of these women?

14:01.642 --> 14:03.308
Yeah, they look
like cult girls.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.979
Used to run a roadside fruit stand
till the locals shut them down.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.049
Great apples.

14:11.117 --> 14:15.319
So two more. So fast.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.689
He's escalating.

14:17.757 --> 14:20.358
I see you've been
following the cases closely.

14:20.425 --> 14:25.129
I have no choice. Cops come by every
time a teenager misses her curfew.

14:25.196 --> 14:27.631
Look, I know
my criminal profile

14:27.699 --> 14:32.670
is close to your predator's M.O.
But... I spent 13 years

14:32.737 --> 14:36.273
in maximum security.
Rehab. Therapy.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.842
I kinda resent having
my life defined by it.

14:38.910 --> 14:41.243
So do the women you raped.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.245
We'll check out your alibis.

14:43.313 --> 14:45.514
Let you know if we have
any further questions.

14:47.517 --> 14:49.752
He's absolutely
counting on that.

14:49.820 --> 14:54.190
He's good. He's smart.
I'll bet he's never been caught.

15:00.263 --> 15:03.131
I sent Toby back to Fawn.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.602
He's OK on his own.
He's very disarming.

15:06.670 --> 15:10.606
So, Toby said that
he saw the rapist

15:10.674 --> 15:13.274
watching Blaire and Fawn,
but nothing else.

15:13.342 --> 15:16.077
Could he be the Artemis stalker?
The guy with the camera.

15:16.144 --> 15:18.813
All of his alibis check out.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.848
So that leaves us with...

15:20.916 --> 15:23.218
Deerfoot...

15:26.188 --> 15:29.823
Or persons unknown.

15:29.890 --> 15:32.158
So maybe there was
one sexual predator

15:32.227 --> 15:34.027
after the first two girls

15:34.095 --> 15:36.363
and someone else
after the Artemis girls.

15:36.431 --> 15:38.965
Two predators
working the same area.

15:39.033 --> 15:41.401
A copycat.

15:41.469 --> 15:44.637
Hey. So, forensics
is back on Fawn's stuff.

15:44.705 --> 15:48.407
There's no DNA.
But trace soil on the rope

15:48.475 --> 15:53.479
used to tie her hands is unique. It's some
kind of clay that's found in ponds up there.

15:53.547 --> 15:56.849
All right. Send a K-9 unit
and a ground search crew.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.984
Let's check every pond
within a 15km radius

15:59.052 --> 16:01.886
of that bus stop.
I'll handle the media.

16:01.954 --> 16:03.355
OK.

16:03.422 --> 16:07.325
"Mothering Earth
abides our missteps.

16:07.393 --> 16:10.128
"We're still human, after all.

16:10.195 --> 16:12.063
"The opposite
of pure isn't poison;

16:12.131 --> 16:14.633
it's giving up on ever
feeling clean again."

16:14.700 --> 16:17.434
- Hey, did you find Blaire?
- No. Not yet.

16:17.502 --> 16:19.903
Just, uh, just coming
to see how you're doing.

16:19.971 --> 16:21.705
You're a bad liar, man.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.775
- It's Toby, right?
- Yeah.

16:24.842 --> 16:26.744
- This is my friend Ben.
- Hey, Ben.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.480
- You jealous much?
- As if.

16:29.547 --> 16:31.282
Get lost.

16:35.519 --> 16:38.087
No concussion.
That's really good.

16:38.155 --> 16:40.222
How'd you get away with that?

16:40.291 --> 16:43.359
- They made some allowances for me.
- That's pretty rare.

16:45.529 --> 16:46.696
You're a faker.

16:46.764 --> 16:49.431
- I know what you're thinking.
- You do?

16:49.499 --> 16:52.701
Yeah. You're thinking what's a nice girl
like me doing in a cult like Artemis.

16:52.769 --> 16:56.104
Sure. That's crossed my mind.

16:56.172 --> 16:58.940
You don't know
what it's like, do you?

16:59.008 --> 17:01.543
To feel safe.
Like you belong.

17:01.611 --> 17:04.045
To be loved.

17:04.113 --> 17:07.181
No one would ever
hurt me in Artemis.

17:07.248 --> 17:09.148
You say that like
you know who would.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.789
- No. I didn't mean it that way.
- Are you sure?

17:14.856 --> 17:18.392
'Cause I get the feeling that this isn't the
first time someone's tried to hurt you.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.627
I'm sorry.

17:20.694 --> 17:22.494
I'm really, really tired.

17:27.468 --> 17:30.637
Hey. Hey, Ben.

17:35.876 --> 17:39.778
You're telling me you wouldn't wear a bullet
proof vest if it had realistic pecks and abs?

17:39.846 --> 17:43.582
- No. - You'd look like He-Man!
- You are so weird. Hey, Toby.

17:43.650 --> 17:46.017
Hey, what's going on?
You all right?

17:46.085 --> 17:49.421
Elyse, would you grab us a few
slices of pizza? One each.

17:49.489 --> 17:53.190
- I don't need a slice.
- Well, I'll eat two. - I'll get take-out.

17:53.258 --> 17:56.293
What's going on, man? You look a little
rough around the edges. You working a case?

17:56.362 --> 17:58.929
Sexual predators.
Missing girls.

17:58.997 --> 18:01.432
Cults. - Oh, wait. Is this that
place that's been on the news?

18:01.500 --> 18:04.569
- Artemis.
- Artemis. You deal with that?

18:04.636 --> 18:08.005
Yeah, I'm a... you know,
working the Artemis case.

18:08.073 --> 18:10.707
You know, everyone in Artemis

18:10.775 --> 18:13.510
they have this beautiful
way of looking at you.

18:13.578 --> 18:16.045
This light and warmth and

18:16.113 --> 18:19.549
everything. It's...
it's kinda cool.

18:19.617 --> 18:21.651
And this one girl,
Fawn, she's a victim.

18:21.719 --> 18:24.754
And I'm trying
to get through to her.

18:24.821 --> 18:27.189
I know there's something
else there. I can feel it.

18:27.257 --> 18:29.725
I'm trying to read her,
get things from her...

18:29.793 --> 18:32.762
I don't know, I can't.
I'm just...

18:32.829 --> 18:36.965
- Where did these come from?
- The corner store. They also sell sandwiches and salads.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.134
Whoa! Ciabatta bun. Toby!

18:39.202 --> 18:42.103
No.

18:42.170 --> 18:45.640
I'll be up front.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.709
- That's a sweet girl.
- Yeah, she is.

18:47.777 --> 18:50.445
Did you, uh... Does Sandy know
about this sweet girl?

18:50.513 --> 18:52.647
Sandy's busy saving the world.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.316
She doesn't have time for
long conversations like that.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.151
Or even to return
phone calls really.

18:58.219 --> 19:00.186
(Phone ringing)

19:00.254 --> 19:03.223
- Always helpful. Thank you.
- Michelle, what's going on?

19:03.291 --> 19:07.160
We just found Janet and Lindsay.
Yeah. We need you back at IIB.

19:07.228 --> 19:10.964
Our serial predator is
now a serial killer.

19:17.482 --> 19:19.617
<i>Obviously my heart, uh...</i>

19:19.684 --> 19:23.620
<i>Goes out to the members</i>
<i>of the families of those girls.</i>

19:23.687 --> 19:28.290
<i>But... it's absolutely tragic...</i>
<i>but there's been no arrest made.</i>

19:28.358 --> 19:32.929
<i>And IIB has not given</i>
<i>us any word. There are now two--</i>

19:33.494 --> 19:36.729
I don't mean to be the downer
here, but the chances of finding

19:36.796 --> 19:40.265
- Blaire alive are now less than 10%.
- The first two were killed

19:40.333 --> 19:43.635
within 72 hours
of their abductions. Thanks.

19:43.702 --> 19:46.438
- Ritual killings?
- After feeding them some type

19:46.506 --> 19:50.108
of fluid that accelerates clinical dehydration.
Some form of vinegar

19:50.176 --> 19:53.945
that Fawn smelled in the pickup. Toxicology's
working on exactly what that is.

19:54.013 --> 19:56.747
Medieval Europeans took
vinegar medicinally

19:56.814 --> 19:59.450
to flush the system.
Could it be ritual purgation?

19:59.518 --> 20:01.452
So maybe it's not sexual.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.320
Maybe it is.

20:03.388 --> 20:06.357
What if he's blaming these girls
for exciting him?

20:06.425 --> 20:09.493
- Well, that would dial us back to Artemis, wouldn't it?
- Yeah, who've just

20:09.561 --> 20:12.062
formally refused to give us
their membership list.

20:12.129 --> 20:15.131
What if it's a family member,
an ex-member, or, you know,

20:15.199 --> 20:16.832
someone with a bone to pick?

20:16.900 --> 20:19.035
Or that stalker
they were talking about.

20:19.103 --> 20:22.372
I think Fawn knows who he is.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.974
Talk to her.

20:25.042 --> 20:28.044
OK, listen.
It's going to be OK. All right?

20:28.111 --> 20:32.147
OK? Our thoughts are
with Blaire.

20:32.215 --> 20:34.216
Oh, no. Oh, no.

20:34.284 --> 20:36.485
She's... Blaire says she's dead.

20:36.553 --> 20:38.787
Fawn.

20:38.854 --> 20:41.590
Can I talk to her a minute, please?
Do you mind if I just...

20:41.657 --> 20:44.158
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

20:44.226 --> 20:45.859
Fawn?

20:45.927 --> 20:48.362
Hey, Fawn.

20:48.430 --> 20:51.432
Fawn, we think
she might still be alive.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.968
We don't know
for how long. Look,

20:54.035 --> 20:56.937
I know what it's like
to know things.

20:57.005 --> 21:00.974
Terrible things. Things that
you think you can't tell anyone.

21:01.041 --> 21:02.509
Not like this.

21:02.577 --> 21:04.911
Yeah. You know
what he's capable of.

21:04.979 --> 21:07.514
The people he doesn't
fool, he hurts.

21:07.582 --> 21:11.284
They're scared just like you.
Look, I promise.

21:11.352 --> 21:15.655
You help us find him, he will
never hurt anyone again.

21:15.723 --> 21:17.789
Ugh!

21:17.857 --> 21:21.059
Ask my father.

21:21.128 --> 21:23.596
He'll know.

21:23.663 --> 21:25.364
Thank you.

21:25.432 --> 21:29.168
<i>Why the hell didn't</i>
<i>you bring her home?</i>

21:29.236 --> 21:31.670
We're Fawn's parents,
for Pete's sake.

21:31.738 --> 21:35.039
- Is she all right? Where is she now?
- She's fine.

21:35.107 --> 21:37.242
She went back to Artemis
after she was released.

21:37.309 --> 21:38.743
Released?

21:38.810 --> 21:41.446
She's a prisoner of a cult.
What are you thinking?

21:41.514 --> 21:44.215
She says
she feels safe at Artemis.

21:44.283 --> 21:46.651
I take it you
two feel otherwise?

21:46.718 --> 21:48.752
[Mother]: <i>This is it.</i>
<i>You've done it now.</i>

21:48.819 --> 21:52.489
Don't you know what
goes on in that place?

21:52.557 --> 21:55.925
The kind of perverts and cons?
The sort of crap they believe?

21:55.993 --> 21:57.894
Well, you must be desperate
to get her out of there.

21:57.962 --> 22:01.198
I imagine you've tried
everything. Anything.

22:03.968 --> 22:07.670
Son, all we can do now is pray.

22:11.741 --> 22:13.709
OK. We never got
a clear shot of this guy

22:13.777 --> 22:16.179
on the surveillance tape,
but we did get a license plate.

22:16.246 --> 22:18.914
He drives a rental car,
and it's registered to...

22:18.982 --> 22:20.348
this guy.

22:20.416 --> 22:22.884
Whoa! Hey, yup.
That's our guy.

22:22.951 --> 22:25.253
This guy gave a photo to Jim.
He's our stalker.

22:25.321 --> 22:28.223
Ok. He goes by the
name of Donald Ramsay.

22:28.291 --> 22:30.325
He's a cult deprogrammer.

22:30.393 --> 22:33.428
He specializes in involuntary
extraction and forcible confinement.

22:33.496 --> 22:35.730
"Mental cleansing
for the post-cult mind."

22:35.798 --> 22:38.098
- Sounds like a good cover.
- Yeah. Let's go deeper.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.767
OK. According to his credit
cards he's been

22:40.835 --> 22:43.804
at a motel on the Lakeshore since just
before our first girl was abducted.

22:43.871 --> 22:47.474
Well, this is our first
hot lead for Blaire. Let's go.

22:47.542 --> 22:52.245
IIB. May we come in?

22:52.313 --> 22:54.447
(Sniffing)

22:54.515 --> 22:56.249
What's that smell?

22:56.317 --> 22:57.950
Clean. I need things clean.

22:58.018 --> 23:00.820
- I have allergies.
- Mr. Ramsay, do you

23:00.887 --> 23:03.489
extract people from new
religious organizations?

23:03.557 --> 23:07.193
- Try to deprogram them somehow?
- You mean cults?

23:07.261 --> 23:10.629
Bet if your sister or daughter
or husband was in one,

23:10.697 --> 23:13.498
- you'd call 'em what they are.
- Nice-looking girl.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.667
It's my daughter.
She's dead.

23:15.736 --> 23:19.371
- Cult.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.941
Are you?
Don't touch that, please.

23:22.008 --> 23:27.378
What is it that you do
exactly, Mr. Ramsay?

23:27.446 --> 23:30.849
I spare families
from suffering as I have.

23:30.916 --> 23:33.051
Oh, and we're supposed
to believe that that stops short

23:33.119 --> 23:35.220
at kidnapping?

23:35.287 --> 23:38.489
(Camera shutter)

23:38.557 --> 23:41.158
(Gasping)

23:41.226 --> 23:45.528
- OK. We're gonna need to know your 
whereabouts-- - That's enough. Get out. Now.

23:45.596 --> 23:47.798
Don't come back unless
you have a warrant.

23:47.866 --> 23:49.566
You got it.

23:56.453 --> 23:59.480
The suspect threw my guys out.
I can't get more without a search--

23:59.600 --> 24:02.358
Oh, for crying...

24:02.426 --> 24:06.728
No warrant. There's no law against taking
pictures, evidently, and no hard evidence

24:06.796 --> 24:10.265
connecting Ramsay to the murders or
Fawn's abduction. It's all circumstantial.

24:10.333 --> 24:13.402
So we're protecting the rights
of professional kidnapper

24:13.469 --> 24:18.273
whose clients believe the right to worship are
subject to their personal opinion. That's great.

24:18.341 --> 24:22.443
Well, let's get him on that. Let's get him
for conspiring to abduct Fawn Georges.

24:22.510 --> 24:24.778
And then once he's in here
we'll drill him for Blaire.

24:24.846 --> 24:27.415
Well, Fawn never saw her
attacker, and her father isn't

24:27.482 --> 24:30.952
gonna admit that he paid someone to abduct
his own daughter. - Let's try the mother.

24:31.019 --> 24:32.553
OK.

24:36.891 --> 24:39.725
Jim says a wife can't testify
against her husband.

24:39.793 --> 24:42.028
In some cases.

24:42.096 --> 24:44.530
You'd be making a statement
in your own defence.

24:44.598 --> 24:49.669
Mrs. Georges,
this is Ms. Donleavy.

24:49.736 --> 24:52.272
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi.

24:52.340 --> 24:55.341
I'm Mary. I'm very happy
to hear that Fawn is OK.

24:55.408 --> 24:56.575
Thank you.

24:59.379 --> 25:03.615
I understand that she and
Blaire are very good friends.

25:03.683 --> 25:06.452
Yes, they are.

25:10.889 --> 25:13.458
I need your help.

25:16.227 --> 25:19.829
Carol Georges' sworn statement
that Don Ramsay was paid

25:19.897 --> 25:22.832
to abduct Fawn.
Let's get those warrants.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.868
Yes.

25:30.875 --> 25:34.843
Present for you.

25:34.911 --> 25:40.816
Oh, nice of you to pack all this up for
us, Mr. Ramsay. It's all evidence.

25:54.730 --> 25:57.265
[Michelle]: Blaire's
about the same age

25:57.333 --> 26:00.168
<i>as your daughter was</i>
<i>when she died, right?</i>

26:00.236 --> 26:03.238
<i>Does she remind you</i>
<i>of her, Don?</i>

26:03.305 --> 26:07.307
[Don]: <i>I take pictures of all the girls
to show their parents where they are.</i>

26:07.375 --> 26:10.277
[Michelle]: <i>So you're not</i>
<i>stalking these girls?</i>

26:10.345 --> 26:14.314
Targeting them to prove to them
how lucky they are to be alive?

26:14.382 --> 26:17.551
Like Blaire.
<i>And Fawn.</i>

26:17.618 --> 26:20.087
<i>I never touched Fawn.</i>
<i>Never had the chance.</i>

26:20.155 --> 26:23.590
- [Michelle]: <i>Let's start back at the beginning, then.
- Thank you.</i>

26:23.658 --> 26:25.058
Toby, anything?

26:25.125 --> 26:27.627
No. I'm not getting him
with any of our girls.

26:27.695 --> 26:29.629
This guy likes
zip ties, not rope.

26:29.697 --> 26:31.631
He's our stalker,
not our killer.

26:31.699 --> 26:33.199
What about Fawn?

26:33.267 --> 26:37.202
I'm getting he never
had a chance to get to her.

26:37.270 --> 26:39.838
(Knocking)

26:48.214 --> 26:51.316
Toxicology came back on the
dead woman's stomach contents.

26:51.384 --> 26:54.652
Cider vinegar. Don here uses
household vinegar.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.155
- He cleans everything with it.
- Allergies.

26:58.223 --> 27:01.659
- Hey, ask him about the truck.
- I did. Earlier.

27:01.727 --> 27:04.128
You asked where it was.
If he never drove it,

27:04.196 --> 27:05.997
he wouldn't know where it is.

27:06.065 --> 27:08.032
The stalker and the
killer work the same turf.

27:08.100 --> 27:11.401
- Maybe they crossed paths.
- OK.

27:11.469 --> 27:15.305
It was a beater. It was covered in crap,
so I figured it was a farm vehicle.

27:15.372 --> 27:19.009
It was cruising the bus stop, I
don't know, maybe cruising girls.

27:19.077 --> 27:22.178
<i>I don't know. I never saw the
driver because it was always dark.</i>

27:22.246 --> 27:24.780
<i>It didn't have any plates, and</i>
<i>that's it. That's all I know.</i>

27:27.584 --> 27:31.220
- Cult go home!
- Give us our children back!

27:31.287 --> 27:33.422
You're not wanted here!

27:33.490 --> 27:35.290
Brown pickup?

27:35.358 --> 27:38.360
No. Not that I can think of.
Of course, we don't drive.

27:38.428 --> 27:42.196
- We need to question everyone.
- They're all suspects? Again.

27:42.264 --> 27:44.633
This truck is linked
to all of the abductions.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.835
Now, look.

27:46.902 --> 27:48.737
Your people.
They work the farms.

27:48.804 --> 27:51.673
Someone might have seen where
this guy is hiding the truck.

27:51.741 --> 27:55.110
We need a list of every member.
Background checks will clear all of them.

27:55.177 --> 27:57.011
We've been through all this.

27:57.078 --> 27:59.113
This is an invasion
of their right to privacy.

27:59.180 --> 28:03.283
No. This is about more than privacy, Mr. Deerfoot.
This is about Blaire's life.

28:03.351 --> 28:06.586
Don't forget that.

28:06.655 --> 28:09.156
We need the public's help
to find a brown pickup truck.

28:09.223 --> 28:11.558
It's in the media release.
That's my statement.

28:11.626 --> 28:15.161
I added our coroner's results to a similar M.O. 
search and got a match to a series of killings

28:15.228 --> 28:17.229
- in Vancouver.
- Four sex trade workers

28:17.297 --> 28:21.233
abducted, force-fed vinegar,
strangled to death, dumped,

28:21.301 --> 28:23.235
- no arrests.
- Yeah.

28:23.303 --> 28:26.205
With over 20 forensic elements
that match with our guy.

28:26.273 --> 28:29.307
The last body was found
six months ago.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.547
Get me RCMP Regional
Command of Vancouver.

28:37.516 --> 28:41.419
All right. I feel your fear.
And I do. I know your concerns.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.855
But you saw how these
officers cared for Fawn.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.223
They need every one of us now.
For Blaire.

28:46.291 --> 28:49.593
OK? So what I want you
to do is just open your hearts

28:49.661 --> 28:52.496
and share what light you can.
Because she would do it for you.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.464
Believe me.

28:54.532 --> 28:55.933
OK.

28:56.001 --> 28:59.937
So, we're looking for an old,
beat-up pickup truck.

29:00.005 --> 29:05.542
Brown. You might have seen it
on one of the farms around here?

29:05.610 --> 29:07.143
No more bodies found

29:07.212 --> 29:09.346
in Vancouver for the last
six months. That's confirmed.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.880
No suspects.

29:10.948 --> 29:13.283
Check that Artemis
list for newcomers.

29:13.351 --> 29:15.485
I just got a hit from the DMV.

29:15.553 --> 29:19.422
A traffic camera in Mississauga caught a
plateless brown pickup running a red light.

29:19.489 --> 29:22.057
- The driver's nice and clear.
- I love you.

29:22.125 --> 29:24.227
Um... Artemis.

29:24.294 --> 29:27.430
There's three new members
in the past six months.

29:27.497 --> 29:30.233
Two of them have checked
out OK, but this last guy,

29:30.300 --> 29:33.135
- it's like he doesn't exist at all.
- Klein. Hold a minute, please.

29:33.203 --> 29:35.803
- Where's Michelle?
- She's already at Artemis.

29:35.871 --> 29:38.340
Nice. Circulate the picture.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.344
No.

29:42.411 --> 29:43.978
Bring in the next group.

29:48.751 --> 29:50.817
It's OK. Thank you.

29:55.156 --> 29:57.491
This is the next group.

29:59.628 --> 30:02.062
- You OK?
- Yeah.

30:06.367 --> 30:09.736
- Those beautiful children!
- Excuse me. Outta my way!

30:09.804 --> 30:13.373
- We don't want you!
- Go away! Leave us!

30:15.542 --> 30:18.245
Cops said to give it
to Sergeant McCluskey.

30:18.312 --> 30:21.214
It's for you.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.417
It's from Klein.

30:25.485 --> 30:29.621
- Yeah.
- It's still so beautiful.

30:29.689 --> 30:33.159
- We need to see Ben right now.
- Ben?

30:33.226 --> 30:36.128
Ben left. He said that Fawn was
already overexposed to outsiders.

30:36.196 --> 30:40.832
Oh, I love it here.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.868
Ben? But, no!
Ben! Ben!

30:47.951 --> 30:50.719
I don't know. We, uh, we can't
find either one of them.

30:52.503 --> 30:55.091
There's this place I heard Ben

30:55.159 --> 30:56.876
and Fawn talking about
in the hospital.

30:56.996 --> 31:01.898
Yeah? - It's dusty. It's made of wood.
Maybe a building?

31:01.965 --> 31:04.599
- What? Is it a shed? A barn?
- A barn! It's a barn.

31:04.667 --> 31:07.769
It's got machinery in it. Gears.
Where is this? Do you know?

31:07.837 --> 31:10.705
- Yeah. The Robson's barn.
- That's where they are.

31:10.773 --> 31:13.041
It was a converted
mill or something.

31:13.109 --> 31:15.677
Dev, we need a unit to every
barn within a 10K radius.

31:15.744 --> 31:17.813
We're heading
to the Robson barn.

31:40.901 --> 31:42.968
This is the place.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.684
(Crash!)

32:02.654 --> 32:04.355
Michelle?

32:32.048 --> 32:34.250
He's gotta be close.

32:34.317 --> 32:36.818
Shed.

32:49.832 --> 32:51.833
(Board creaking)

33:03.678 --> 33:06.046
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

33:08.182 --> 33:10.217
Here it is.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.854
Dev, we found a tunnel.

33:13.922 --> 33:16.690
Send backup ASAP.
We're going in. Track us.

33:29.403 --> 33:31.538
All right. Call me back.
What do we got?

33:31.605 --> 33:35.407
Well, the coordinates line up with tunnels
used by the underground railroad.

33:35.475 --> 33:37.709
They were used to smuggle slaves
from the States

33:37.777 --> 33:40.712
and later used by bootleggers
during prohibition.

33:40.780 --> 33:44.616
The problem is that they were never
mapped properly, so I'm getting confused

33:44.684 --> 33:47.385
between the tunnels themselves
and the city storm drains.

33:47.454 --> 33:49.988
OK. But he had a way to get
those bodies to that pond.

33:50.056 --> 33:52.790
So let's track the stream. Maybe
there's a drain that intersects.

34:10.608 --> 34:12.641
(Computer beeping)

34:12.710 --> 34:14.377
Yeah.

34:14.445 --> 34:17.514
OK, look. There's an exit point
at a creek just upstream.

34:17.581 --> 34:20.784
That's it. Let's get everything
we have over there. Lock it down.

34:29.391 --> 34:32.327
- Toby!
- Blaire?

34:32.395 --> 34:33.596
Blaire. Hey.

34:33.663 --> 34:35.931
Blaire. Blaire. Hey.

34:35.998 --> 34:37.399
Hey. Blaire.

34:37.467 --> 34:40.400
She's got a pulse.

34:40.469 --> 34:43.571
She's breathing barely.
She's alive, but...

34:43.639 --> 34:45.507
we gotta get her outta her.

34:53.248 --> 34:55.983
Got her?

35:01.523 --> 35:04.992
All right. The tunnels are clear.
The heat sensor showed up nothing.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.561
Continue the ground search. He's
gotta be out there somewhere.

35:11.031 --> 35:13.699
(Siren)

35:39.825 --> 35:42.860
(Clanking metal)

36:13.423 --> 36:18.227
You were the one.
You saw our desire.

36:22.031 --> 36:25.601
(Fawn sighs)

36:34.210 --> 36:36.144
I need to make her pure.

36:36.212 --> 36:38.546
To set her free.

36:38.614 --> 36:42.650
She had all this...
flesh.

36:42.718 --> 36:45.820
The others were sent
to test me.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.992
Fawn tests me more.

36:52.059 --> 36:54.761
It's not a test, Ben.

36:54.829 --> 36:58.732
What you feel, what you see when
you look at her, that's love.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.968
And that's beautiful.
That's pure.

37:02.036 --> 37:04.837
You have the light.
I see it.

37:04.904 --> 37:07.940
She has it too.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.343
All I ever wanted was
to protect her.

37:10.410 --> 37:13.346
- Keep her safe.
- You have.

37:13.413 --> 37:17.016
No, I failed.

37:19.119 --> 37:21.419
I know what it's like

37:21.487 --> 37:24.623
to be consumed by your thoughts.

37:27.059 --> 37:31.196
It's the only thing
you have on your mind.

37:31.264 --> 37:34.466
It's lonely. I know.

37:34.534 --> 37:37.401
You gotta let me help you.

37:39.471 --> 37:42.506
I need to make her pure.

37:47.612 --> 37:49.913
Hey. Hey. Hey.
No. No. No. No. No.

37:49.981 --> 37:54.284
Ben! I know you see
the light in me.

37:54.351 --> 37:57.387
I'm with you.
I can help you.

37:57.454 --> 37:59.855
I can help her be free.

37:59.923 --> 38:02.892
You gotta trust me.

38:02.959 --> 38:04.860
Trust me.

38:04.928 --> 38:06.796
Let me do what's right.

38:06.863 --> 38:09.198
I can help you end this.

38:13.603 --> 38:19.074
(Crying)

38:26.248 --> 38:29.183
(Kissing)

38:29.251 --> 38:32.119
(Fawn trembling)

38:38.960 --> 38:41.261
Thank you.

38:41.329 --> 38:44.030
Thank you.

38:49.837 --> 38:52.339
It's going be OK, Fawn.
Fawn?

38:59.512 --> 39:02.281
(Austere choral music)

39:44.888 --> 39:49.358
(Singing)

40:06.542 --> 40:10.144
(He clears his throat)

40:10.212 --> 40:12.113
- You came. I'm glad.
- How are you?

40:12.181 --> 40:15.482
- Good. I'm well.
- Good. How's Blaire doing?

40:15.550 --> 40:18.552
- Well, she's recovering.
- Good.

40:18.620 --> 40:21.988
I can see that you relaxed
the policy on family members.

40:22.056 --> 40:25.359
Yeah. Yeah, before all this,
you know, we welcomed everyone,

40:25.427 --> 40:28.529
anyone, to Artemis. Then we...
we locked ourselves away.

40:28.596 --> 40:30.764
Made us blind to certain

40:30.832 --> 40:34.434
realities we needed to address.
So... change is growth, huh?

40:34.501 --> 40:36.936
- Good luck.
- OK. Be well, Toby.

40:37.003 --> 40:39.706
- Thank you.
- OK. I'll talk to him.

40:39.773 --> 40:44.076
I want to talk to you about something.
Thank you for looking after my daughter.

40:44.144 --> 40:47.112
- How's your mother?
- Pretty great, considering.

40:47.180 --> 40:49.648
She filed for divorce
and she's not giving me grief

40:49.716 --> 40:51.350
about being with them.

40:51.417 --> 40:55.520
She's got her own transcendence
to work on now. Thanks to you.

40:55.588 --> 40:57.222
That's good.

40:57.289 --> 41:00.225
Don't worry.
You can take it with you.

41:00.292 --> 41:03.594
It's harder to find
outside, but it's there.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.896
You just have to look
for it in others...

41:05.964 --> 41:08.065
to see it in yourself.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.800
(Magical shimmering)

41:13.171 --> 41:17.975
(Dramatic music)

41:37.827 --> 41:40.328
- For food I got skills.
- Oh, hi.

41:40.397 --> 41:43.931
- Hey.
- Hey, man. I totally knocked.

41:43.999 --> 41:46.967
- Um, I made him use his key.
- You don't got food at your house?

41:47.035 --> 41:49.904
No, we're just having a little cooking lesson here.
She's teaching me how to make

41:49.971 --> 41:52.573
a real meal. Takes like
10 minutes and it's fantastic.

41:52.641 --> 41:54.542
- She's got a real touch.
- That's nice.

41:54.610 --> 41:56.811
It's not just condiments
and delivery numbers.

41:56.879 --> 41:59.045
- That's nice.
- Would you like to join us?

41:59.113 --> 42:02.549
- No, I'm... I'm beat.
- Please! It'll be fun.

42:02.617 --> 42:04.718
You and I can build
a dining room table out

42:04.786 --> 42:07.521
- of all of his take out boxes. - OK. All right. 
I'm recycling those in the morning.

42:07.588 --> 42:09.289
Next time.

42:09.356 --> 42:12.158
- Next time. - Thank you.
- Don't dawdle.

42:12.226 --> 42:14.360
- OK.
- Like a duck.

42:16.496 --> 42:18.431
It's just a friendly dinner.

42:18.498 --> 42:20.433
I'm trying to, you know, expand
my horizons, so she's making me

42:20.500 --> 42:22.535
- a meal.
- You like her.

42:22.602 --> 42:24.737
I just... It'd be fun to...
What's going on with the, uh...

42:24.805 --> 42:25.938
The girl in the cult?

42:26.005 --> 42:28.441
- She's good.
- Are you good?

42:28.508 --> 42:31.576
- I'm good.
- You don't need to talk about anything? I can go?

42:31.644 --> 42:35.647
- No. I'm good. - Cool. I should get back.
- Leftovers, eh? Bring 'em back.

42:35.714 --> 42:39.317
Yeah, I will bring them back
tomorrow morning.

42:39.384 --> 42:43.455
- Be safe.
- You're a pal, huh?

42:43.522 --> 42:46.424
Don't worry.
I got the door.

42:50.195 --> 42:52.663
