WEBVTT

00:06.747 --> 00:08.348
It's from
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

00:08.662 --> 00:09.894
What do you think?

00:09.896 --> 00:11.797
I don't know.

00:11.799 --> 00:14.533
If we're going to start
a fantasy sword collection--

00:14.535 --> 00:17.536
and I've long thought
we should--

00:17.538 --> 00:19.737
is this really
the sword to start with?

00:19.739 --> 00:21.456
What did you
have in mind?

00:21.458 --> 00:25.794
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd have to go with Excalibur.

00:25.796 --> 00:28.580
It gives you the right
to rule England.

00:28.582 --> 00:31.383
It would be a replica
of a movie prop.

00:31.385 --> 00:33.552
Fair enough.

00:33.554 --> 00:36.972
It'd give you the right to rule
a replica of England.

00:36.974 --> 00:39.274
Well, they don't have
an Excalibur here,

00:39.276 --> 00:40.976
so what do you want to do?

00:40.978 --> 00:43.662
Mm. Tough decision.

00:43.664 --> 00:46.281
There's no weaponry from
<i>Lord of the Rings</i>

00:46.283 --> 00:49.767
forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

00:49.769 --> 00:52.871
Just Bilbo Baggins' sword
over there.

00:52.873 --> 00:57.459
Two grown men with a hobbit's
dagger; wouldn't we look silly?

00:59.328 --> 01:00.612
Okay, let's go for it.

01:00.614 --> 01:02.631
Oh, I see
you guys have

01:02.633 --> 01:03.732
found my little treasure.

01:03.734 --> 01:05.500
Yeah.

01:05.501 --> 01:06.835
It's okay, I guess.

01:06.837 --> 01:08.453
Okay? It's magnificent.

01:08.455 --> 01:10.222
Buh-buh-buh-buh!

01:12.058 --> 01:13.625
What do you want for it?

01:13.627 --> 01:15.894
Oh, it's hard to put
a price on something

01:15.896 --> 01:18.547
that's a copy of something
that was on pay cable.

01:19.515 --> 01:21.933
But for my friends,
let's say 250?

01:21.935 --> 01:24.186
Oh, that's pretty steep.

01:24.188 --> 01:25.253
Well, it's a limited edition.

01:25.255 --> 01:28.490
They only made 8,000
of these bad boys.

01:28.492 --> 01:29.941
Only 8,000?

01:29.943 --> 01:32.077
We're wasting precious time.
Buy it.

01:32.079 --> 01:33.912
Hang on.

01:33.914 --> 01:35.980
Can you do any better?

01:35.982 --> 01:37.282
Are you kidding?

01:37.284 --> 01:39.034
I'm already giving you
the friends and family discount.

01:39.036 --> 01:40.168
Oh, did you hear that?

01:40.170 --> 01:41.670
We're getting the friends
and family discount.

01:41.672 --> 01:44.105
We are honored
and we will take it.

01:44.107 --> 01:45.323
Slow down.

01:45.325 --> 01:46.625
Two hundred.

01:46.627 --> 01:47.626
What are you doing?

01:47.628 --> 01:49.377
250 is already the
discounted price.

01:49.379 --> 01:51.296
Will you shut up?

01:51.298 --> 01:52.464
Tell you what, I'll go 235.

01:52.466 --> 01:53.882
Nope. Maybe another time.

01:53.884 --> 01:55.784
Okay, 225-- my final offer.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.470
Take it, take it.

01:58.472 --> 02:00.305
Two hundred.

02:00.307 --> 02:02.057
Man, you're killing me!

02:02.059 --> 02:04.442
Killing you?
I can't breathe.

02:05.111 --> 02:07.545
210, and I'm losing money.

02:07.547 --> 02:10.398
Oh, now, we can't let him lose
money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.568
210 and you throw in
the Iron Man helmet.

02:13.570 --> 02:14.736
Are you crazy?

02:14.738 --> 02:16.371
That helmet's signed
by Robert Downey Jr.

02:16.373 --> 02:17.572
So?

02:17.574 --> 02:19.357
Okay, if you're
going to question

02:19.359 --> 02:21.927
the importance of an actor's
signature on a plastic helmet

02:21.929 --> 02:23.828
from a movie
based on a comic book,

02:23.830 --> 02:27.565
then all of our lives
have no meaning!

02:30.586 --> 02:32.137
Okay, fine.

02:32.139 --> 02:33.471
Just the sword, 210.

02:33.473 --> 02:35.040
Thank you.

02:35.042 --> 02:36.508
I can eat meat this week.

02:38.427 --> 02:39.427
See that?

02:39.429 --> 02:40.729
I just saved us 40 bucks.

02:40.731 --> 02:43.064
I've long said, what you
lack in academic knowledge

02:43.066 --> 02:45.767
you make up for
in street smarts.

02:45.769 --> 02:46.884
You want me to wrap it?

02:46.886 --> 02:47.885
No, it's okay.

02:47.887 --> 02:49.738
I'm gonna stab my friend
in the chest.

02:50.856 --> 02:52.774
Hey, Stuart.

02:52.776 --> 02:53.842
Ah, hey, Wil.

02:53.844 --> 02:57.162
Hello, Wil Wheaton.

02:57.164 --> 02:59.080
Hi, Sheldon.

02:59.082 --> 03:00.115
Nice sword.

03:00.117 --> 03:02.117
It's part of
my sword collection.

03:02.119 --> 03:04.536
- Do you have a sword collection?
- No.

03:04.538 --> 03:07.455
I'm not surprised.

03:07.457 --> 03:09.924
Here's the
Batman 612

03:09.926 --> 03:12.427
with the Jim Lee alternate
cover that you wanted.

03:12.429 --> 03:14.296
Awesome. What do I owe you?

03:14.298 --> 03:15.096
40 bucks.

03:15.098 --> 03:16.131
Good deal.

03:16.133 --> 03:17.432
Sucker.

03:17.434 --> 03:19.968
Didn't even ask for the
friends and family discount.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.770
Hey, I'm having a party
at my house on Friday,

03:21.772 --> 03:23.254
and I was hoping
you would stop by.

03:23.256 --> 03:24.522
Will there be
girls there?

03:24.524 --> 03:25.473
Yeah, of course.

03:25.475 --> 03:28.810
'Cause there
wasn't last time.

03:28.812 --> 03:31.780
There will be girls.

03:31.782 --> 03:34.482
You guys are invited
if you want to come by.

03:34.484 --> 03:36.100
Thank you.

03:36.102 --> 03:37.101
All right, great.

03:37.103 --> 03:38.620
Later.

03:40.489 --> 03:42.273
I see what you're doing.

03:42.275 --> 03:43.958
You accept
an invitation

03:43.960 --> 03:46.177
to a party at the home
of my sworn enemy,

03:46.179 --> 03:47.912
he tells everyone we're
going to be there,

03:47.914 --> 03:49.781
and when we don't show,
he looks the fool.

03:49.783 --> 03:51.166
Fiendishly clever.

03:52.668 --> 03:54.336
I was actually
thinking about going.

03:54.338 --> 03:57.555
And then declaring
the party a fiasco

03:57.557 --> 03:59.391
and storming out,
leaving him humiliated

03:59.393 --> 04:00.809
in front of his guests.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.777
Love it.

04:02.779 --> 04:06.715
No, I was gonna grab Raj and
Howard and have a good time.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.601
Oh, great, more guys.

04:09.603 --> 04:13.071
It's gonna be another
Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.

04:39.006 --> 04:41.318
Sheldon, can you
grab me a water?

04:41.319 --> 04:42.901
Possibly.

04:42.903 --> 04:44.512
Can you or can't you?

04:44.513 --> 04:46.146
It's not that simple, Leonard.

04:46.148 --> 04:48.732
It never is, is it?

04:48.734 --> 04:49.900
At this moment,

04:49.902 --> 04:52.019
our relationship exists

04:52.021 --> 04:54.188
in two mutually
contradictory states.

04:54.190 --> 04:58.609
Until you either do not go
or go to Wil Wheaton's party,

04:58.611 --> 05:02.029
you are simultaneously my friend
and not my friend.

05:03.498 --> 05:05.115
I'm characterizing
this phenomenon

05:05.117 --> 05:08.252
as Schrodinger's Friendship.

05:08.254 --> 05:11.088
Got it. Can I have my water?

05:11.090 --> 05:12.373
Of course.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.658
Now get it yourself,
you traitor.

05:16.494 --> 05:19.713
Wait, what is going on?

05:19.715 --> 05:21.098
In case you have forgotten,

05:21.100 --> 05:22.666
Schrodinger's cat is
a thought experiment...

05:22.668 --> 05:24.167
No, no, I didn't forget.

05:24.169 --> 05:27.104
Um, there's this cat in a box
and until you open it,

05:27.106 --> 05:28.939
it's either
dead or alive or both.

05:29.858 --> 05:31.525
Although, back in Nebraska,
our cat got stuck

05:31.527 --> 05:34.194
in my brother's camp trunk,
and we did not need to open it

05:34.196 --> 05:36.814
to know there was all kinds
of dead cat in there.

05:37.983 --> 05:39.850
Homespun stories,
knowledge of physics

05:39.852 --> 05:41.201
and a bosom that defies it.

05:41.203 --> 05:43.153
You're the whole package,
aren't you?

05:45.123 --> 05:46.991
Sorry I'm late.

05:46.993 --> 05:48.792
Uh, I got great news.

05:48.794 --> 05:50.911
NASA picked my team's design

05:50.913 --> 05:53.530
for the deep field
space telescope that's going on

05:53.532 --> 05:55.249
the International Space Station
this spring.

05:57.086 --> 05:58.686
Howie, that's wonderful!

05:58.688 --> 05:59.687
Congratulations!

05:59.689 --> 06:00.888
It gets better.

06:00.890 --> 06:03.057
Someone has to go up
with the telescope

06:03.059 --> 06:07.811
as a payload specialist,
and guess who that someone is.

06:07.813 --> 06:10.414
Muhammad Li.

06:11.215 --> 06:13.550
Who's Muhammad Li?

06:13.552 --> 06:16.353
Muhammad is the most common
first name in the world,

06:16.355 --> 06:17.988
Li, the most common surname.

06:17.990 --> 06:19.490
As I didn't know the answer,

06:19.492 --> 06:21.825
I thought that gave me
a mathematical edge.

06:21.827 --> 06:24.061
It's me, Sheldon.

06:24.063 --> 06:24.962
It's me.

06:24.964 --> 06:26.396
I'm going up in space!

06:26.398 --> 06:28.565
Technically, I'm an astronaut.

06:28.567 --> 06:30.451
That's amazing!

06:30.453 --> 06:32.069
Hang on a second.

06:32.071 --> 06:33.954
NASA doesn't have
a shuttle anymore.

06:33.956 --> 06:35.906
How are you going
to get up there?

06:35.908 --> 06:37.041
Oh, well, it's really cool.

06:37.043 --> 06:39.093
You fly to Moscow,
they take you out to Kazakhstan,

06:39.095 --> 06:41.929
and then you get into a Russian
Soyuz rocket which shoots you

06:41.931 --> 06:43.263
into a low earth orbit.

06:43.265 --> 06:45.883
Or just sits there on the launch
pad because the Kazakhi mafia

06:45.885 --> 06:47.968
sold the rocket fuel
on the black market.

06:50.055 --> 06:52.222
Are those Russian rockets safe?

06:52.224 --> 06:54.641
Well, I mean, safe as it
can be when it was built

06:54.643 --> 06:56.810
by the good folks who
brought you Chernobyl.

06:58.697 --> 07:01.098
I'd like to propose a toast.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.767
The dream to go up into space
is one we all share,

07:03.769 --> 07:06.036
and Howard's making that
a reality.

07:06.038 --> 07:07.488
We're all very proud of you.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.956
Cheers.

07:10.441 --> 07:11.658
That was a lovely toast.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.960
Kudos.
Thank you.

07:12.962 --> 07:14.912
Simultaneously, a festival
of cloying clichés.

07:14.914 --> 07:16.964
You sicken me.

07:24.672 --> 07:26.140
You're really quiet.

07:26.142 --> 07:27.791
Is everything okay?

07:27.793 --> 07:29.843
Fine.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.565
Just a little tired.

07:34.567 --> 07:36.800
I hope not too tired,
because I'm feeling

07:36.802 --> 07:39.136
particularly masculine
right now.

07:40.355 --> 07:43.306
All systems go,
if you catch my drift.

07:43.308 --> 07:46.910
I always catch your drift.

07:46.912 --> 07:49.747
All right, well, something's
obviously bugging you.

07:49.749 --> 07:50.948
What is it?

07:50.950 --> 07:53.000
I just can't believe
you signed up

07:53.002 --> 07:55.252
for the space program
without even talking to me.

07:55.254 --> 07:58.288
Oh, I get it.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.591
You're worried about me.

08:00.593 --> 08:02.376
That is so sweet.

08:02.378 --> 08:07.931
You know, there's a saying
we have at NASA.

08:10.101 --> 08:13.170
What makes
the right stuff so right

08:13.172 --> 08:16.223
is that it always comes home.

08:17.725 --> 08:20.027
Just stop talking, Howard.

08:21.863 --> 08:23.447
This isn't the reaction
I expected

08:23.449 --> 08:25.849
when I told you
I was gonna be an astronaut.

08:25.851 --> 08:28.235
What did you think
was going to happen?

08:28.237 --> 08:30.404
Honestly? Sex.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.857
Howard.

08:33.859 --> 08:35.876
Do you realize
what a big deal this is?

08:35.878 --> 08:39.630
What an honor it is to be
chosen to go into space?

08:39.631 --> 08:41.030
Yeah, I get it.

08:41.033 --> 08:43.332
I just wish you included me
in the decision.

08:43.335 --> 08:45.368
We're supposed
to be partners.

08:45.370 --> 08:47.304
We're supposed
to be a team.

08:49.174 --> 08:51.091
I'm sorry. You're right.

08:51.093 --> 08:54.645
Okay, let's try this again.

08:54.647 --> 08:58.315
Bernadette, an opportunity
has come up

08:58.317 --> 09:03.270
that impacts both of us,
and I'd like to discuss it.

09:04.772 --> 09:06.556
Okay.

09:06.558 --> 09:09.059
I've been offered
a chance to go up

09:09.061 --> 09:13.063
to the International
Space Station for three weeks.

09:13.065 --> 09:14.915
What are your thoughts on that?

09:14.917 --> 09:18.001
Well, first of all, thank you

09:18.003 --> 09:20.871
for including me
in the decision-making process.

09:20.873 --> 09:23.257
Hey, we're a team.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.792
So, what do you think?

09:25.794 --> 09:27.594
No.

09:28.429 --> 09:29.680
No?

09:29.682 --> 09:31.465
No.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.685
Why not?

09:36.437 --> 09:39.606
Howard, my father
was a police officer.

09:39.608 --> 09:41.758
We never knew
from one night to the next

09:41.760 --> 09:43.694
if he was going
to come home alive.

09:43.696 --> 09:45.112
It was horrible.

09:45.114 --> 09:48.198
And I don't want to live
that way with you.

09:50.818 --> 09:57.124
Hey, my father abandoned me
and my mother when I was 11.

09:57.126 --> 09:59.376
We never saw him again.

09:59.378 --> 10:01.778
Oh, boo-hoo,
you're not going to space!

10:06.617 --> 10:09.586
Pretty cool about
Howard, huh?

10:09.588 --> 10:11.722
Don't talk to me as if
nothing's happened between us.

10:11.724 --> 10:13.140
And yes, it sure is, buddy.

10:16.094 --> 10:18.679
For God's sake, will you stop
with the Schroer stuff.

10:18.681 --> 10:20.898
Would you prefer
a simpler application

10:20.900 --> 10:22.349
of Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle,

10:22.351 --> 10:23.400
in which I could either

10:23.402 --> 10:25.652
know where you are
or whether I like you,

10:25.654 --> 10:27.304
but not both?

10:27.306 --> 10:30.507
You never stop
talking, do you?

10:31.976 --> 10:33.660
I don't understand.

10:33.662 --> 10:34.778
What differences
does it make

10:34.780 --> 10:36.313
if Leonard goes to
Wil Wheaton's party?

10:36.315 --> 10:38.699
Wil Wheaton is
Sheldon's mortal enemy.

10:38.701 --> 10:39.866
Mortal enemy?

10:39.868 --> 10:41.668
Mm-hmm.
Sheldon, I know you're a bit

10:41.670 --> 10:43.203
of a left-handed
monkey wrench, but...

10:43.205 --> 10:46.990
you really have a mortal enemy?

10:46.992 --> 10:49.343
In fact, I have 61 of them.

10:50.178 --> 10:52.129
Would you like to see the list?

10:52.131 --> 10:54.097
Oh, say no, say no,
say no, say no.

10:54.099 --> 10:55.866
You just got off the list.

10:55.868 --> 10:57.768
Would you like back on it?

10:58.603 --> 11:01.004
This'll just take a moment.

11:01.006 --> 11:04.274
It's on a five and a
quarter inch floppy.

11:10.315 --> 11:11.531
A floppy disk?

11:11.533 --> 11:15.118
Well, I started the
list when I was nine.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.354
How did Wil Wheaton
get on the list?

11:17.356 --> 11:18.872
- Oh! Oh, God!
- Oh! Come on!

11:18.874 --> 11:22.209
As a child,
I loved Wesley Crusher,

11:22.211 --> 11:24.294
Wil Wheaton's character
on <i>Star Trek.</i>

11:24.296 --> 11:28.031
So, I drove for hours
by bus to a <i>Star Trek</i> convention

11:28.033 --> 11:30.133
at which Wil Wheaton
was scheduled to appear,

11:30.135 --> 11:33.036
so that I could get my Wesley
Crusher action figure signed.

11:33.038 --> 11:34.972
But he never
showed, because

11:34.974 --> 11:37.090
apparently,
it was cooler for him

11:37.092 --> 11:40.193
to be the lower-left corner
on <i>Hollywood Squares.</i>

11:42.480 --> 11:43.563
Oh, damn!

11:43.565 --> 11:45.082
The floppy failed.

11:45.084 --> 11:46.183
Well,

11:46.185 --> 11:48.218
whoever was in charge
of quality control

11:48.220 --> 11:50.604
at the Verbatim Corporation
in 1989,

11:50.606 --> 11:53.824
congratulations,
you just made the list.

11:57.245 --> 11:59.262
Howard?

11:59.264 --> 12:01.448
Change your
mind about sex?

12:01.450 --> 12:05.235
I'm still mad,
but I'll do it.

12:05.237 --> 12:07.738
No, I've just
been thinking.

12:09.007 --> 12:11.408
It doesn't matter
if I'm afraid for your safety.

12:11.410 --> 12:13.243
I don't want
to be the person

12:13.245 --> 12:15.262
who stands between you
and your dreams.

12:15.264 --> 12:16.713
Really?

12:16.715 --> 12:18.131
Really.

12:18.133 --> 12:20.267
If going into space means
that much to you,

12:20.269 --> 12:22.135
I will never say
another word about it.

12:22.137 --> 12:23.720
Thank you.

12:23.722 --> 12:25.272
I love you.

12:25.274 --> 12:27.257
I love you, too.

12:30.528 --> 12:32.479
So, sex now?

12:32.481 --> 12:34.114
Okay.

12:34.116 --> 12:35.982
I just forgot
to brush my teeth.

12:35.984 --> 12:38.151
I'll be right back.

12:44.442 --> 12:47.610
♪ Oh, baby ♪

12:53.885 --> 12:56.420
♪ I'm ♪

12:56.422 --> 12:58.889
♪ I'm not in love with you... ♪

12:58.891 --> 13:03.143
Over my dead body
my son goes into outer space!

13:06.514 --> 13:09.015
I'm ready.

13:12.466 --> 13:13.785
Wait, let me see
if I got this right.

13:13.786 --> 13:14.986
You actually asked Bernadette

13:14.988 --> 13:16.671
to leave your house
in the middle of the night?

13:16.673 --> 13:18.072
What choice did I have?

13:18.074 --> 13:19.456
She went behind my back

13:19.458 --> 13:21.476
and turned my own mother
against me.

13:21.478 --> 13:24.145
Wow. You're not only
our first astronaut.

13:24.147 --> 13:27.398
You're also the first one
of us to kick a girl out of bed.

13:29.151 --> 13:31.819
You're like a rock star.

13:31.821 --> 13:34.138
Little bit.

13:34.140 --> 13:37.241
I hate to say it,
but she did kind of betray you.

13:37.243 --> 13:38.910
Interesting.

13:38.912 --> 13:42.947
You see betrayal in others,
but not yourself.

13:42.949 --> 13:47.285
Going to Wheaton's party
is not betraying you.

13:47.287 --> 13:49.620
Oh, of course you would have
to believe that.

13:49.622 --> 13:51.706
Evil always thinks
it's doing right.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.158
"Excuse me, Stormtrooper.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.460
These are the droids
you're looking for."

13:57.379 --> 13:59.931
I'm going to a party.

13:59.933 --> 14:04.569
I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO
over to the empire!

14:06.188 --> 14:08.356
Not yet.

14:09.575 --> 14:10.708
So, what's gonna happen next?

14:10.710 --> 14:12.676
Are you and Bernadette going
to break up?

14:12.678 --> 14:13.778
I don't know.

14:13.780 --> 14:15.479
If we're going
to get back together,

14:15.481 --> 14:17.398
she's going to have
to apologize and accept

14:17.400 --> 14:20.785
that I'm a grown man
who can make his own decisions.

14:20.787 --> 14:22.370
Then she's going to have
to convince your mother

14:22.372 --> 14:23.538
to let you go into space.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.189
Obviously.

14:27.609 --> 14:29.577
I had no choice.

14:29.579 --> 14:31.412
I had to tell
his mother.

14:31.414 --> 14:33.664
He can't go to space.

14:33.666 --> 14:38.052
He's like a baby bird.

14:38.054 --> 14:40.755
Do you know
he once got an asthma attack

14:40.757 --> 14:44.058
from reading an old library
book?

14:44.060 --> 14:45.810
You're kidding.

14:45.812 --> 14:47.812
No, I was there that day.

14:47.814 --> 14:50.982
Sheldon threw his back out
handing him that book.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.485
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

14:54.487 --> 14:56.437
I don't want
to break up over this.

14:56.439 --> 14:58.606
Okay, why don't you just
tell him you made a mistake?

14:58.608 --> 15:01.325
Do you guys think
it was a mistake?

15:01.327 --> 15:03.361
Am I the bad guy in this?

15:03.363 --> 15:05.529
It's not for
us to judge.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.865
We're just here to provide
comfort and support

15:07.867 --> 15:09.033
while you come to grips

15:09.035 --> 15:11.085
with what a despicable thing
you've done.

15:12.504 --> 15:15.089
Oh, God, you're right.

15:15.091 --> 15:20.127
I took our love and threw it
under his bus-sized mother.

15:22.381 --> 15:24.265
I need to apologize.

15:24.267 --> 15:26.434
Well, that-that's good.
I'm glad you came to that.

15:26.436 --> 15:29.687
But before you do, let me just
ask you a big picture question.

15:29.689 --> 15:30.471
What?

15:30.473 --> 15:32.640
Are you

15:32.642 --> 15:37.228
100% positive you love and want
to marry Howard Wolowitz?

15:37.230 --> 15:39.697
I do, with all my heart.

15:39.699 --> 15:40.931
Got it.

15:40.933 --> 15:43.367
Just had to check.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.371
He's great.

15:50.626 --> 15:52.543
All right, Sheldon.

15:52.545 --> 15:53.794
We're going to Wil's.

15:53.796 --> 15:55.413
This is your
last chance.

15:55.415 --> 15:58.449
No, Leonard,
this is <i>your</i> last chance.

15:58.451 --> 15:59.884
One day,

15:59.886 --> 16:02.420
a historian is going
to come to you and say,

16:02.422 --> 16:05.389
"Is it true you were friends
with Dr. Sheldon Cooper?"

16:05.391 --> 16:08.259
And you're going to have
to choke back a hot sob

16:08.261 --> 16:09.560
of regret and humiliation

16:09.562 --> 16:11.812
as you mumble,
"I was, but

16:11.814 --> 16:14.682
"I chose to go to a party thrown
by the one kid

16:14.684 --> 16:17.018
from <i>Stand By Me</i>
that no one remembers."

16:19.771 --> 16:21.689
You want to drive?

16:21.691 --> 16:23.891
Sure.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.496
Hey, Sheldon?

16:28.498 --> 16:31.165
Oh, good. You picked me,
you picked me.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.751
No, I just got a
text from Stuart.

16:33.753 --> 16:35.619
Brent Spiner is
at the party.

16:35.621 --> 16:36.954
Brent Spiner?

16:36.956 --> 16:38.756
Yes.

16:38.758 --> 16:41.125
I don't care.

16:41.127 --> 16:43.077
Really?

16:43.079 --> 16:44.295
Brent Spiner,

16:44.297 --> 16:46.297
Mr. Data himself.
You love him.

16:46.299 --> 16:50.167
I did, but I think I've kind of
outgrown <i>Star Trek.</i>

16:52.971 --> 16:55.672
You know, stock characters,

16:55.674 --> 16:57.942
ludicrous plots, "beam me up."

16:57.944 --> 16:59.977
What a load of hooey.

16:59.979 --> 17:01.395
I'm going.

17:01.397 --> 17:03.364
Live long and
prosper, Sheldon.

17:03.366 --> 17:05.199
Yeah, even that.
You look like a dork.

17:08.619 --> 17:12.073
Howard, Bernadette's here!

17:12.075 --> 17:14.075
Tell her I'm not home!

17:14.077 --> 17:16.077
What kind of a schmuck play
is that?!

17:16.079 --> 17:17.494
She can hear you shouting!

17:19.247 --> 17:22.031
Can we talk?

17:22.034 --> 17:24.667
You can. I have nothing to say.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.921
All right.

17:26.923 --> 17:29.006
I just wanted to tell you

17:29.008 --> 17:31.142
I'm sorry I said something
to your mother.

17:31.144 --> 17:33.594
I was gonna tell her eventually,

17:33.596 --> 17:35.763
but you went behind my back.

17:35.765 --> 17:37.598
I know. I'm sorry.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.100
I got scared.

17:39.102 --> 17:40.484
If you're gonna love me,

17:40.486 --> 17:42.737
you're gonna have to
love the whole package:

17:42.739 --> 17:46.524
the tenderhearted poet
and the crazy daredevil.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.744
I know.

17:49.746 --> 17:52.196
Well, don't say it if
you're not gonna mean it,

17:52.198 --> 17:54.665
'cause I'm not just gonna
stop with the space station.

17:54.667 --> 17:58.085
Yeah, I want to go to the
Moon, I want to go to Mars.

17:58.087 --> 18:01.872
I want to take a one-man sub to
the lowest depths of the ocean.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.124
Really?

18:03.126 --> 18:05.676
You got seasick
on Pirates of the Caribbean.

18:06.845 --> 18:11.132
Well, those big kids
were rocking it.

18:12.267 --> 18:15.803
I just did what I did
because I love you so much,

18:15.805 --> 18:19.089
and the thought of losing you
is more than I can handle.

18:19.091 --> 18:20.591
Really?

18:20.593 --> 18:22.476
You're my soul mate.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.697
This is where you kiss me.

18:26.699 --> 18:28.899
Right, right.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.437
Make up all you want!

18:33.439 --> 18:36.824
Your tuchis is not
leaving this planet!

18:43.184 --> 18:45.521
Hey, you know
that beautiful actress who plays

18:45.522 --> 18:47.439
the Borg Queen in <i>First Contact?</i>

18:47.441 --> 18:51.026
- Yeah.
- Well, I just met her gynecologist!

18:54.063 --> 18:55.497
What are you doing here?

18:55.499 --> 18:57.449
Fighting for our friendship.

18:57.451 --> 18:59.584
As peculiar and annoying
as you can be,

18:59.586 --> 19:01.286
you're still my little buddy.

19:01.288 --> 19:03.872
I'm not going
to let that end here tonight.

19:03.874 --> 19:08.293
Now put down that drink, let's
meet Brent Spiner and go home.

19:08.295 --> 19:10.061
Hey, Sheldon,
I'm so glad you made it.

19:10.063 --> 19:11.846
I found something
I think you might like.

19:11.848 --> 19:15.416
What I'd like is for him
to have a more depressing home.

19:15.418 --> 19:18.019
This is quite lovely.

19:18.021 --> 19:19.804
This is for you.

19:19.806 --> 19:23.692
An original mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

19:23.694 --> 19:25.527
I remembered your story
about the time you went

19:25.529 --> 19:27.145
to a convention
when you were a kid

19:27.147 --> 19:28.730
to get one signed,
and I didn't show up.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.264
Look at what I wrote.

19:30.266 --> 19:34.869
"To Sheldon, sorry
this took so long.

19:34.871 --> 19:36.237
Your friend, Wil Wheaton""

19:36.239 --> 19:38.657
It's my last one.

19:38.659 --> 19:40.325
I want you to have it.

19:42.294 --> 19:45.997
Look, everyone.
Wil Wheaton is my friend!

19:48.050 --> 19:50.218
Oh, wow.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.754
I haven't seen one
of these in years.

19:54.507 --> 19:56.675
Remember how we used
to make these things look

19:56.677 --> 19:58.677
like they were masturbating?

19:58.679 --> 20:01.229
Brent Spiner, what
have you done?!

20:01.231 --> 20:03.348
That was an original
mint-in-package

20:03.350 --> 20:04.683
Wesley Crusher
action figure

20:04.685 --> 20:06.901
signed by my close personal
friend, Wil Wheaton.

20:06.903 --> 20:08.186
Sorry, Slim.

20:08.188 --> 20:10.522
I've got some Mr. Data dolls
in the trunk of my car.

20:10.524 --> 20:12.140
You want me
to sign one for you?

20:12.142 --> 20:14.492
You've already signed
something, Brent Spiner.

20:14.494 --> 20:16.695
Your name on my list.

20:19.448 --> 20:21.533
From this moment on,
you are my mortal enemy.

20:21.535 --> 20:25.286
Don't worry. It doesn't take
up a whole lot of your time.

20:25.288 --> 20:27.338
Come on, buddy.

20:27.340 --> 20:29.624
Let's not waste another
second on this loser.

20:29.626 --> 20:33.344
Love your house.

20:33.346 --> 20:35.213
Can <i>we</i> get autographed dolls?

20:35.215 --> 20:36.548
Sure.

20:37.283 --> 20:39.384
20 bucks.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.438
Ten.

20:44.907 --> 20:47.058
$18.

20:47.060 --> 20:47.942
$12.

20:47.944 --> 20:48.727
$16.

20:48.729 --> 20:50.145
Two for $30.

20:50.147 --> 20:52.346
And you come
to my birthday party.

20:53.616 --> 20:55.516
Done.

20:55.518 --> 20:59.518
