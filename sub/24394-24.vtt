17:02.101 --> 17:03.976
-Yes.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.226
Lauryn:
These are herbs that have been
around for thousands of years.

17:09.308 --> 17:11.517
This one is going to give you

17:11.600 --> 17:12.976
mental power,
sexual energy,

17:13.059 --> 17:14.142
and muscle tone.

17:14.226 --> 17:16.184
That's how simple
wellness could be.

17:16.267 --> 17:19.350
Duboc: Lauryn is part
of a new wave of wellness
influencers,

17:19.433 --> 17:21.725
who are often not licensed
medical professionals,

17:21.809 --> 17:23.892
but can make huge sums
of money endorsing,

17:23.976 --> 17:26.433
so-called, natural products
and supplements.

17:27.392 --> 17:28.976
Today,
the US supplements market

17:29.059 --> 17:32.517
generates between
$35-40 billion annually.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.184
But with this explosion in
the popularity of supplements,

17:35.267 --> 17:37.350
many Americans are looking
to them as alternatives

17:37.433 --> 17:39.892
to more conventional
healthcare treatments.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.600
We're in Boonville, Indiana,

17:42.684 --> 17:44.267
to meet a woman
with a chronic illness

17:44.350 --> 17:46.892
who's been experimenting
with dietary supplements

17:46.976 --> 17:49.642
to try to alleviate
some of her symptoms.

17:49.976 --> 17:53.226
I mean, like, I wanted
to be back to myself.

17:53.308 --> 17:55.892
Duboc:
Ten years ago,
schoolteacher Andi Waters

17:55.976 --> 17:57.725
developed
hemiplegic migraines,

17:57.809 --> 18:01.059
leaving her largely housebound
and unable to work.

18:01.142 --> 18:03.059
If I have a migraine,
basically what happens

18:03.142 --> 18:05.558
is my body behaves as
if it's had a stroke.

18:05.642 --> 18:07.350
You know,
my face will lose feeling.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.558
My speech gets real
thick and slurred.

18:09.642 --> 18:11.892
My right leg'll go out.

18:11.976 --> 18:13.558
I can wake up
and be feeling fine,

18:13.642 --> 18:16.517
and in the span of 10 minutes,
be laying on the couch,

18:16.600 --> 18:18.392
fully incapacitated.

18:18.475 --> 18:21.433
Duboc:
Even with a daily cocktail
of prescription drugs,

18:21.517 --> 18:22.767
her medical doctors
have told her

18:22.850 --> 18:24.976
that her symptoms
may never go away.

18:25.059 --> 18:28.184
At that point,
you get so desperate.

18:29.475 --> 18:34.308
So, I ended up going
to a naturopath here
in town, and...

18:34.392 --> 18:36.767
they gave me
vitamins that were

18:36.850 --> 18:40.558
literally, like, $60 a week.

18:40.642 --> 18:42.267
And once you get there
and you're paying for it,

18:42.350 --> 18:44.059
and you're paying for it,
and you're paying for it,

18:44.142 --> 18:46.725
and they're telling you,
the whole time
you're paying for it,

18:46.809 --> 18:48.142
"This is gonna--
In three months,

18:48.226 --> 18:49.976
you're gonna feel so much bet--
in three months."

18:50.059 --> 18:52.101
Then, inevitably,
it doesn't work, and...

18:52.184 --> 18:55.267
you watch your bank account
just kind of dwindle,

18:55.350 --> 18:57.308
as, you know, you've paid
for your stupidity,

18:57.392 --> 19:00.059
and, uh,
you pick yourself up
and you move on,

19:00.142 --> 19:02.600
-and for some people,
it's to the next cure-all.
-Mm-hmm.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.017
And for me, it was just
bitterness and anger.

19:05.101 --> 19:07.642
Duboc:
And it's not just
the chronically ill pinning

19:07.725 --> 19:09.976
their hopes and money
on supplements.

19:10.059 --> 19:11.850
We met with Dr. Nina Shapiro,

19:11.934 --> 19:13.767
a surgeon
and author of the book,

19:13.850 --> 19:15.976
"Hype, A Doctor's Guide
to Medical Myths,

19:16.059 --> 19:18.308
Exaggerated Claims,
and Bad Advice,"

19:18.392 --> 19:21.767
to discuss what makes
alternative medicines
so appealing.

19:21.850 --> 19:23.642
People who need to take
a vitamin or a supplement

19:23.725 --> 19:26.267
are people who are deficient in
those vitamins or supplements,

19:26.350 --> 19:28.142
which is an extremely small

19:28.226 --> 19:31.517
percent of
the human population.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.976
It's very tricky,
and it's very enticing,
and the labeling is great.

19:36.059 --> 19:37.684
The marketing is phenomenal.

19:37.767 --> 19:41.308
These are next to regulated
medications often,

19:41.392 --> 19:44.142
whether it's in a pharmacy
or in a grocery store,

19:44.226 --> 19:47.558
and it is really deceptive
for the consumer.

19:47.642 --> 19:50.684
And if many of these
products or therapies

19:50.767 --> 19:52.017
haven't been proven to work,

19:52.101 --> 19:53.850
why are they
allowed to be sold

19:53.934 --> 19:56.850
with claims which suggest
that they do work?

19:56.934 --> 19:59.392
Claims are tricky because,

19:59.475 --> 20:01.475
you know, again,
that's marketing any product.

20:01.558 --> 20:03.184
You can say that
any product works.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.017
It certainly can,

20:05.101 --> 20:08.308
and a lot of why these
products can get away with it

20:08.392 --> 20:11.725
and why people
continue to buy them
is the placebo effect.

20:11.809 --> 20:14.976
And the placebo effect is real
and it's very powerful,

20:15.059 --> 20:17.184
and that keeps people shopping.

20:17.267 --> 20:20.350
Duboc:
Dr. Tor Wager is one of
the leading researchers

20:20.433 --> 20:23.725
studying the powerful effects
placebos have on the body.

20:23.809 --> 20:27.350
Getting a placebo treatment
can have surprisingly
large effects

20:27.433 --> 20:29.558
on depression, and anxiety,

20:29.642 --> 20:32.308
and even some
neurological disorders,
like Parkinson's disease.

20:33.142 --> 20:35.101
We are studying
placebo effects

20:35.184 --> 20:37.892
to understand
the brain mechanisms

20:37.976 --> 20:39.892
that allow that kind
of response to work.

20:39.976 --> 20:43.934
Duboc:
The test he's doing
on me today is based
on pain sensitivity,

20:44.017 --> 20:46.226
via a device that will
safely burn my skin.

20:46.308 --> 20:48.892
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Stop, stop, stop!

20:48.976 --> 20:52.267
Three separate spots on my
arm were covered in cream.

20:52.350 --> 20:55.226
I was told the center one
was painkilling lidocaine,

20:55.308 --> 20:57.767
while the outer two
were merely moisturizer.

20:58.350 --> 20:59.934
All three spots were
then burned,

21:00.017 --> 21:03.226
and I was asked to rate
the pain level of each.

21:03.308 --> 21:05.059
-The first one was
the most painful.
-Mm-hmm.

21:05.142 --> 21:06.600
The last one was
the second most painful,

21:06.684 --> 21:08.059
and the middle one,

21:08.142 --> 21:10.642
with the lidocaine,
was the least painful.

21:10.725 --> 21:13.600
The thing is because you knew
this was a placebo study,

21:13.684 --> 21:15.267
-we double-crossed you.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.976
-So, these were both
moisturizer cream.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.976
So, in this case,
you had a little bit less pain

21:20.059 --> 21:22.809
with the placebo than
with the actual lidocaine.

21:22.892 --> 21:26.101
And that's in part because
you expected it to be lower.

21:26.184 --> 21:28.600
So, why did that happen?

21:28.684 --> 21:31.600
Placebo treatments
can activate

21:31.684 --> 21:33.892
the brain systems in
the prefrontal cortex,

21:33.976 --> 21:36.558
that are really important
for assignment of meaning.

21:36.642 --> 21:37.892
In addition, we're seeing

21:37.976 --> 21:39.433
activation of
pathways that connect

21:39.517 --> 21:41.101
the frontal cortex
to the brainstem.

21:41.184 --> 21:43.267
And so, what we're finding
is that a placebo treatment

21:43.350 --> 21:46.600
can tap into that system,
and can activate

21:46.684 --> 21:49.059
natural pain-relieving
chemicals in your brain.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.684
Can you give some
examples of ways that

21:51.767 --> 21:54.642
placebo works in
alternative medicine?

21:54.725 --> 21:56.433
A big part,
I think, of

21:56.517 --> 21:59.184
how people progress
over time with illness

21:59.267 --> 22:02.142
is their narrative for
what that illness is.

22:02.226 --> 22:04.184
What caused it?
What's gonna help me?

22:04.267 --> 22:06.017
Is there help?
Is there hope?

22:06.101 --> 22:07.475
I think,
to the degree

22:07.558 --> 22:09.184
that alternative
medicine treatments

22:09.267 --> 22:12.142
work that don't have any real
physiological mechanisms,

22:12.226 --> 22:15.350
they work by helping people
to change that narrative.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.767
And if people
feel better

22:17.850 --> 22:19.809
after taking
some substance,

22:19.892 --> 22:22.308
that could be caused
by the placebo effect,

22:22.392 --> 22:24.642
in which case,
it's not

22:24.725 --> 22:27.017
the thing that you're
taking that's helping you.

22:27.101 --> 22:28.767
It's you helping you.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.850
Duboc:
And, as it turns out,

helping people help themselves

Many attendees
find inspiration

24:06.517 --> 24:08.976
in Goop's message that
more conventional medicine

24:09.059 --> 24:10.600
isn't your only option.

24:10.684 --> 24:14.059
For me, personally,
Western medicine failed me.

24:14.142 --> 24:15.892
In one appointment,
he was like,

24:15.976 --> 24:18.308
"Oh, you have this.
Here's this prescription."

24:18.392 --> 24:20.934
And tried to send me
on my way. I was like, no!

24:21.017 --> 24:22.976
I know there's something
deeper going on,

24:23.059 --> 24:25.059
and I know it's not
just this one thing

24:25.142 --> 24:27.267
that you labeled me under,
which is so common,

24:27.350 --> 24:29.433
which is IBS. I'm like,

24:29.517 --> 24:32.600
I'm sorry, but that's BS
because no.

24:32.684 --> 24:36.433
And it ended up being
leaky gut, and Hashimoto's,
and I lost my period.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.350
So, that's why I've turned
to functional medicine

24:38.433 --> 24:40.433
because it's helped
me so much more.

24:40.517 --> 24:43.976
Duboc:
But for all the faith Goop
devotees have in the brand,

24:44.059 --> 24:46.101
it is has been a target
of harsh criticism

24:46.184 --> 24:48.475
for the promotion
of certain products.

24:48.558 --> 24:50.809
The non-profit organization,
Truth in Advertising,

24:50.892 --> 24:53.767
filed a complaint with several
California district attorneys,

24:53.850 --> 24:56.475
alleging Goop made 51
deceptive health claims

24:56.558 --> 24:58.226
about the products it promote.

24:58.892 --> 25:00.809
We wanted to ask
Goop about the ethics

25:00.892 --> 25:03.350
of playing health guru

the Goop Summit,

25:16.350 --> 25:18.934

25:20.558 --> 25:24.059
What do you think it has to
say about society in America?

25:24.142 --> 25:25.684
Well, I think that

25:25.767 --> 25:27.142
the idea of wellness
really starts

25:27.226 --> 25:28.850
to resonate
with people when

25:28.934 --> 25:31.809
either they, or someone
that they love very much,

25:31.892 --> 25:34.142
is in some kind of
a health crisis,

25:34.226 --> 25:38.017
and the answers
are not effective.

25:38.101 --> 25:41.017
-Mm-hmm.
-It's not about throwing
out Western medicine,

25:41.101 --> 25:42.350
but it really is

25:42.433 --> 25:44.350
about understanding
that the consumer,

25:44.433 --> 25:47.226
especially women in America
who aren't feeling well,

25:47.308 --> 25:48.892
and who are feeling unheard,

25:48.976 --> 25:50.725
people really want now

25:50.809 --> 25:53.142
to have autonomy in
their wellness journey,

25:53.226 --> 25:54.892
and so the consumer
is starting

25:54.976 --> 25:57.184
to shape the way all
of this is happening.

25:57.267 --> 25:58.892
Yeah, we've been
hearing that all day.

25:58.976 --> 26:02.350
Women are finding
themselves feeling dismissed

26:02.433 --> 26:05.433
by conventional routes.
They want more options.

26:05.517 --> 26:08.059
But, I mean,
here you do offer

26:08.142 --> 26:10.892
products and practices
that are

26:10.976 --> 26:13.350
accepted by
the medical consensus

26:13.433 --> 26:16.101
-that have peer-reviewed
scientific studies.
-Right.

26:16.184 --> 26:18.059
But then, you offer
things that haven't,

26:18.142 --> 26:19.850
-but they're all
under the same roof.
-Right.

26:19.934 --> 26:21.934
Well, I think,
the idea is that

26:22.017 --> 26:23.226
science is always changing,

26:23.308 --> 26:25.226
and theories are
always changing, and,

26:25.308 --> 26:27.892
of course,
evidence is key.

26:27.976 --> 26:30.517
But, sometimes, evidence
is anecdotal for people.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.184
So, these debates
spark where, you know,

26:33.267 --> 26:35.892
as something is emerging
and as ideas are shifting,

26:35.976 --> 26:38.184
-there's always
a lot of resistance...
-Yeah.

26:38.267 --> 26:40.558
...by the status quo,
and that's okay.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.433
And we're
always saying,

26:42.517 --> 26:43.976
take everything
with a grain of salt.

26:44.059 --> 26:45.934
Take everything your
conventional doctor says

26:46.017 --> 26:47.392
with a grain of salt,
and take everything

26:47.475 --> 26:48.809
your healer's saying
with a grain of salt.

26:48.892 --> 26:50.934
But what's resonant for you?

26:52.558 --> 26:53.558
Okay, fine.

26:53.642 --> 26:55.101
So, lastly,

26:55.184 --> 26:58.059
we're in this kind of terrifying
age of misinformation,

26:58.142 --> 27:01.142
and science itself is,
sort of, under attack.

27:02.184 --> 27:04.433
Why not be
the vanguard and,

27:04.517 --> 27:06.267
you know,
help women

27:06.350 --> 27:08.600
know what is really,
peer-reviewed

27:08.684 --> 27:11.101
and evidence-based science,
and what isn't?

27:11.184 --> 27:12.433
We do!

27:12.517 --> 27:15.767
We tag our contents if
something is evidence-based,

27:15.850 --> 27:18.308
peer-reviewed science,
then it's tagged as such.

27:18.392 --> 27:21.976
And if it's an emerging
modality, we tag it as such.

27:22.059 --> 27:24.059
So, we're very clear
about what is what.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.101
But not in the way that
conventional medicine says,

27:26.184 --> 27:27.725
"this works,
and this doesn't."

27:28.934 --> 27:30.642
-So, so for example,

27:30.725 --> 27:33.184
if something
doesn't work,

27:33.267 --> 27:34.684
you're not saying that.

27:34.767 --> 27:36.600
-Yeah. For example,

27:36.684 --> 27:38.767
meditation,
science says it works,

27:38.850 --> 27:40.809
whereas some of the other
things you offer,

27:40.892 --> 27:42.600
like vitamin pills,

27:42.684 --> 27:46.142
are proven not to work in
the way that Goop says they do.

27:46.226 --> 27:48.392
Well, I think that,
you know,

27:49.226 --> 27:50.767
for example, with vitamins,

27:50.850 --> 27:52.850
if you are deficient
in a vitamin,

27:52.934 --> 27:54.475
then a supplement
really does work,

27:54.558 --> 27:57.184
and there's a lot
of data behind that.

27:57.267 --> 27:59.142
But, apparently,
we're not deficient--

28:01.433 --> 28:04.517
Okay. All right. Fine.
Thank you so much.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.976
-We've had an amazing time.
Thank you.
-Good!

28:07.059 --> 28:08.350
Duboc:
While we didn't get
a chance

28:08.433 --> 28:10.892
to discuss the Truth
in Advertising claims,

28:10.976 --> 28:13.308
the district attorneys
took action.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.725
And recently, the company
settled a lawsuit

28:15.809 --> 28:18.809
with California's Food, Drug,
and Medical Device Task Force,

28:18.892 --> 28:21.142
for, "misrepresentations about

28:21.226 --> 28:23.392
the effects, efficacy,
or attributes"

28:23.475 --> 28:24.892
of some of their products,

28:24.976 --> 28:28.059
including their
infamous vagina eggs.

28:28.142 --> 28:29.684
Goop released
a statement calling it,

28:29.767 --> 28:31.350
an "honest disagreement,"

28:31.433 --> 28:33.809
thanking the task force
for its, "guidance,"

28:33.892 --> 28:36.475
as the brand moves from
a "pioneer in this space

28:36.558 --> 28:39.017
to an established
wellness authority."

28:39.101 --> 28:42.475
Goop denies liability,
and is still selling
the eggs.

28:42.558 --> 28:43.892
All it did was reword

28:43.976 --> 28:46.517
the product description
on the website.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.392
With limited
government oversight,

28:48.475 --> 28:50.433
Goop's and other
companies' products

28:50.517 --> 28:54.392
are left to be regulated
by consumer complaints
and the marketplace.

28:54.475 --> 28:57.059
And celebrities
and social media influencers

28:57.142 --> 28:58.892
continue to be
the driving force

28:58.976 --> 29:00.684
behind the wellness industry,

29:00.767 --> 29:02.433
even when the products
and health claims

29:02.517 --> 29:04.517
they make are called
into question.

We want something that

29:07.267 --> 29:10.226

finding that connection

we will rise up to...
