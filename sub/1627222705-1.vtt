WEBVTT

00:52.962 --> 00:54.797
I know you're in there.

01:08.878 --> 01:11.581
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I just wanna talk.

02:27.790 --> 02:30.026
That looks nice.

02:30.059 --> 02:32.494
What?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.429
The beach, looks nice.

02:36.799 --> 02:38.701
Oh.

02:38.735 --> 02:41.436
Yeah.

02:41.470 --> 02:44.306
Too bad I'll never get away.

02:44.339 --> 02:46.743
I thought maybe
it was a gift from Pete.

02:46.776 --> 02:49.511
Isn't today your anniversary?

02:49.544 --> 02:50.813
I suppose.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.517
Look at you guys.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.354
The war hero
and the homecoming queen.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.890
Could you two be more perfect?

03:02.792 --> 03:05.595
I'm not feeling very perfect.

03:05.628 --> 03:07.295
How do you mean?

03:08.731 --> 03:10.032
Things are different now.

03:12.467 --> 03:15.638
He's changed, I've changed.

03:15.671 --> 03:17.607
Give it time.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.709
You'll find happiness
with that man.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.778
Why do you always need a man
to find happiness?

03:23.646 --> 03:26.048
Don't you ever want more?

03:26.082 --> 03:28.718
I did.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.386
Now I have it.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.288
Maybe you two need
someone to love.

03:35.390 --> 03:37.069
That'll be pretty difficult,
seeing as we haven't

03:37.093 --> 03:38.928
been together
since he's been back.

03:41.496 --> 03:44.566
You think Pete's
having an affair?

03:44.600 --> 03:45.968
What makes you say that?

03:47.637 --> 03:49.504
Sometimes when
a man's cheating, he...

03:53.142 --> 03:54.777
Pete's not cheatin'.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.049
Sorry.

04:00.082 --> 04:02.051
I guess I'm more anxious
about today's appointment

04:02.084 --> 04:03.886
than I thought.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.023
I still can't believe you
and Buddy are having a baby.

04:07.056 --> 04:08.591
You wanna feel?

04:12.962 --> 04:14.563
A miracle, right?

04:14.597 --> 04:17.633
After all the years of trying.

04:17.667 --> 04:21.037
Beth, break's over,
we got customers.

04:21.070 --> 04:23.471
I'd cover for you, hon,
but I'm already late

04:23.505 --> 04:25.675
for my OB appointment.

04:25.708 --> 04:27.643
Walt's sittin' on the counter
if the guys

04:27.677 --> 04:29.444
give you a hard time.

04:31.581 --> 04:33.783
Hey.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.886
Why don't you do
something special tonight?

04:36.919 --> 04:38.855
Maybe fix Pete
his favorite meal.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.993
Will you tell me
what you find out?

04:44.026 --> 04:46.028
You'll be the first.

04:58.107 --> 05:01.476
Food's getting cold.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.112
You got customers, table two.

05:09.952 --> 05:11.888
What can I get you two?

05:11.921 --> 05:13.923
Mm.

05:13.956 --> 05:16.424
Elizabeth.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.861
That's a nice name.

05:18.895 --> 05:20.196
Ain't that pretty, JB?

05:20.229 --> 05:23.132
Mm-hm.

05:25.668 --> 05:27.970
Now, JB,

05:28.004 --> 05:30.538
that's no way to treat a lady.

05:33.776 --> 05:35.678
- Let me go.
- Mm.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.016
One night with me, darlin',

05:40.049 --> 05:42.118
will change your life forever.

05:43.753 --> 05:45.755
We got a problem here?

05:51.627 --> 05:53.863
Well,

05:53.896 --> 05:56.065
we're just two hungry fellas

05:56.098 --> 05:58.100
looking for something to eat.

05:58.134 --> 06:00.803
Yeah, some poontang pie.

06:05.775 --> 06:08.811
Go over to the counter, Beth.

06:08.844 --> 06:10.512
Listen to me good.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.184
You've got 60 seconds

06:15.217 --> 06:17.620
to get your low-life ass
out of here

06:17.653 --> 06:19.221
before I pull
a background check on you

06:19.255 --> 06:22.858
and that sorry excuse
you have for a vehicle.

06:26.996 --> 06:29.031
Take your lap dog with you.

06:37.073 --> 06:39.709
Next time,

06:39.742 --> 06:41.077
I won't hold him back.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.244
Please don't tell Pete
about what happened.

07:18.914 --> 07:20.916
I don't like secrets.

07:20.950 --> 07:23.919
You know I'm right.

07:23.953 --> 07:25.988
If he finds out,
he'll make me quit.

07:28.290 --> 07:31.127
He's been on edge
since he's come back.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.095
I do my best
to keep things calm,

07:33.129 --> 07:35.563
but I don't want anything
to set him off.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.068
If you need anything.

07:41.937 --> 07:43.672
I'll be fine.

07:46.609 --> 07:48.911
Well,

07:48.944 --> 07:50.579
I best be going.

07:56.886 --> 07:59.688
Why not make
a fresh start of it?

07:59.722 --> 08:02.224
Give Pete a chance to show you
what he's made of.

08:36.025 --> 08:37.226
Hey, Pete.

08:37.259 --> 08:39.328
What's your 20?

08:39.361 --> 08:41.097
Hey, Walt, I'm on Route 12.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.032
- You?
- I was just at the diner

08:43.065 --> 08:45.668
getting a cup of Joe.

08:45.701 --> 08:48.137
Saw Beth.

08:48.170 --> 08:49.738
Any trouble?

08:49.772 --> 08:51.707
Nothing to worry about.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.677
I heard it's your anniversary.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.278
Uh-huh.

08:56.312 --> 08:59.181
Doing anything special?

08:59.215 --> 09:01.684
Not much.

09:01.717 --> 09:05.121
Lord knows I shouldn't
be giving marriage advice.

09:05.154 --> 09:08.257
You sure you wanna be having
this conversation on the radio?

09:08.290 --> 09:12.728
But take it from one
who's old and wise.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.130
Well, you're half right.

09:16.232 --> 09:18.701
I know the look, Pete.

09:18.734 --> 09:20.703
Your woman's in love.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.175
You're a good man.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.777
Don't be afraid
to show Beth who you are.

09:30.713 --> 09:33.082
I'll keep that in mind.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.684
Tonight should be
a walk in the park.

09:35.718 --> 09:37.353
Walk in the park.

09:37.386 --> 09:38.721
Got it.

09:38.754 --> 09:39.922
Over and out.

14:51.801 --> 14:54.203
Hi.

14:54.236 --> 14:55.504
Hey.

14:57.372 --> 14:58.741
You look great.

15:06.649 --> 15:08.484
I made dinner.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.790
It's getting cold.

15:13.823 --> 15:15.390
Right.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.461
Aren't you forgetting something?

16:07.409 --> 16:09.177
You really do look beautiful.

16:24.293 --> 16:27.229
Let me get cleaned up.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.431
You'll have to use the jug.

16:29.464 --> 16:31.133
We don't have water.

16:31.166 --> 16:33.535
I meant to tell you,
I'm working on the well pump.

16:33.569 --> 16:37.573
The cap's off,
so don't go out back, okay?

16:37.607 --> 16:39.676
I'll be right down.

16:49.786 --> 16:51.888
Ooh.

16:51.921 --> 16:53.590
That's a relief.

16:55.457 --> 16:57.727
Ready to roll.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.762
Relax.

16:59.796 --> 17:01.598
Still early.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.304
Beautiful night.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.844
You see that?

17:14.877 --> 17:16.478
Shooting star.

17:16.511 --> 17:18.615
Falling star's more like it.

17:20.917 --> 17:22.351
It's good luck.

17:22.384 --> 17:25.320
For you, maybe.

17:25.354 --> 17:28.457
My horoscope says I was
born under an unlucky star.

17:30.492 --> 17:32.427
Unexpected trouble.

17:32.461 --> 17:33.896
Stars aren't unlucky, JB.

17:36.699 --> 17:38.835
For the longest time,
we couldn't even see them.

17:41.638 --> 17:43.472
What about what
Madame Rosie told me?

17:43.505 --> 17:45.642
Forget about that gypsy.

17:45.675 --> 17:47.209
Our fortune's up this road.

17:48.945 --> 17:50.923
Besides, since when were you
afraid of a little B and E?

17:50.947 --> 17:53.181
It's more than that.

17:53.215 --> 17:54.516
In and out.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.754
That's it.

17:59.822 --> 18:01.490
Feels like a shit job to me.

18:08.798 --> 18:11.199
Damn.

18:11.233 --> 18:12.802
Fucking told you,
I fucking told you.

18:12.835 --> 18:14.937
Just be cool, man, be cool.

18:24.814 --> 18:27.750
Well, would you look here.

18:27.784 --> 18:28.927
What do you think
the chances are

18:28.951 --> 18:30.987
we run into each other twice?

18:33.022 --> 18:35.257
See, JB?

18:35.290 --> 18:37.794
It is our lucky night.

18:37.827 --> 18:41.430
What are you fellas doing here
on the side of the road?

18:41.463 --> 18:42.765
Nature was calling.

18:46.268 --> 18:47.846
You know, I find it peculiar
that you're here

18:47.870 --> 18:49.538
on the side of the road,
being that

18:49.571 --> 18:52.008
there's only
one house at the end,

18:52.041 --> 18:54.577
which happens to belong
to a good friend of mine.

18:59.615 --> 19:01.259
You fellas wouldn't happen
to have open container

19:01.283 --> 19:03.786
or marijuana, would you?

19:03.820 --> 19:06.354
No, sir, officer.

19:10.559 --> 19:11.894
Step outta the car.

19:11.928 --> 19:13.562
You know the drill.

19:22.939 --> 19:26.042
I won't insult your intelligence
by instructing you what to do.

19:28.044 --> 19:29.779
You two don't disappoint.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.989
Oh, what do we have here?

19:40.022 --> 19:42.825
I have a license for that.

19:42.859 --> 19:44.660
I bet you do.

19:47.429 --> 19:49.498
Give me a reason.

20:07.717 --> 20:10.418
You boys going hunting?

20:10.452 --> 20:12.655
We like to be prepared.

20:12.688 --> 20:14.624
Regular boy scouts, I take it.

20:19.128 --> 20:21.898
Why the long faces?

20:21.931 --> 20:23.633
Gee, I wonder.

20:25.735 --> 20:28.537
Look, just to show you
what kind folk

20:28.570 --> 20:30.673
we are around here,

20:30.706 --> 20:33.475
I'm not gonna even
call it in on my radio.

20:33.508 --> 20:36.779
See, I think the best thing
to do is let you go

20:36.813 --> 20:38.748
with a simple warning.

20:48.124 --> 20:50.960
You two hoodlums,

20:50.993 --> 20:52.862
you get in that wreck,

20:52.895 --> 20:55.097
turn your asses around,
and go back

20:55.131 --> 20:57.432
to whatever little hole
you came from.

20:59.068 --> 21:00.937
Am I understood?

21:07.877 --> 21:09.745
You boys have a good night.

21:29.732 --> 21:33.435
That goddamn cop took our guns.

21:33.468 --> 21:35.838
What the hell are we gonna do
without our guns?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.709
We'll think of something.

22:22.251 --> 22:23.786
That smells great.

22:23.819 --> 22:25.888
I hope it tastes great.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.937
11 in progress, shots fired.

22:48.010 --> 22:50.980
Could we eat
without the scanner tonight?

22:51.013 --> 22:52.682
Is it bothering you?

22:52.715 --> 22:55.851
- Well, it's just...
- No, of course.

23:03.059 --> 23:05.261
Tonight I'm off duty.

23:08.931 --> 23:10.565
Yeah, how you gonna get 'em out?

23:10.599 --> 23:13.135
Ah, I'm resourceful.

23:13.169 --> 23:16.471
I'll think of something.

23:30.152 --> 23:31.754
Thank you.

23:47.837 --> 23:49.872
Would you like me
to put on some music?

24:03.185 --> 24:04.186
You remember this?

24:06.155 --> 24:07.690
Of course.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.294
Come on.

24:22.838 --> 24:25.307
You can hold me tight,
I'm not gonna break.

24:34.283 --> 24:36.352
Why are you smiling?

24:36.385 --> 24:38.187
It's just nice to see you happy.

24:49.799 --> 24:52.968
Look.

24:53.002 --> 24:54.236
I know I haven't been...

24:54.270 --> 24:56.238
- Oh, uh...
- Please.

24:56.272 --> 25:00.776
Just let me finish.

25:00.810 --> 25:03.145
I know things
have been tough for you.

25:05.381 --> 25:06.949
But I'm trying.

25:09.819 --> 25:11.253
Just takes time.

25:13.255 --> 25:14.990
I... I know.

25:17.793 --> 25:19.829
I want us back
to the way we were.

25:23.699 --> 25:25.768
That'd be nice.

25:29.338 --> 25:31.774
I just don't know
where to begin.

26:44.446 --> 26:46.215
Beth?

27:12.841 --> 27:14.410
Beth?

28:21.611 --> 28:23.812
Can't sleep?

28:27.617 --> 28:29.818
It's too early.

28:38.527 --> 28:40.496
So quiet.

28:40.529 --> 28:43.365
Isn't quiet good?

28:43.399 --> 28:46.435
It's different than...

28:46.468 --> 28:47.936
Here is so...

28:47.970 --> 28:50.439
Safe?

28:50.472 --> 28:52.207
Yeah.

28:57.513 --> 28:59.114
Everything okay?

28:59.148 --> 29:01.216
Were you expecting anyone?

29:01.250 --> 29:03.952
Not really, maybe Ally.

29:05.354 --> 29:07.956
I don't think so.

29:07.990 --> 29:09.592
Well, I'm sure
they're just lost.

29:09.626 --> 29:11.026
Maybe they're turning around.

29:11.060 --> 29:14.363
You stay here,
I'm gonna check it out.

29:14.396 --> 29:15.608
All right, you point 'em
in the right direction,

29:15.632 --> 29:17.266
then you come back.

29:17.299 --> 29:20.002
Only be a minute.

30:13.522 --> 30:16.458
- Keep the door locked.
- What's wrong?

30:16.492 --> 30:18.527
- Who are those guys?
- There's been an accident

30:18.560 --> 30:20.028
down the road.

30:20.062 --> 30:22.030
Sounds like Walt.

30:22.064 --> 30:24.233
Oh, my God.

30:24.266 --> 30:26.402
We tried to call for help,
but we couldn't

30:26.435 --> 30:27.936
get enough cell service.

30:29.606 --> 30:31.540
Listen, this sounds bad.

30:31.573 --> 30:34.009
I need you to call 911
and get someone out here.

30:34.042 --> 30:37.246
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna ride with them.

30:37.279 --> 30:39.190
Hey, that's fine by me,
but we only got room for one

30:39.214 --> 30:41.049
in the cab.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.952
That's all right, I...
I'll just sit this one out.

30:43.986 --> 30:45.387
- Fine.
- Pete.

30:45.421 --> 30:47.489
I'll be okay.

30:47.523 --> 30:49.491
My keys to the cruiser and gun
are in the statue.

30:49.525 --> 30:52.194
Try to get them while I'm gone.

30:52.227 --> 30:54.363
Whatever you do,
don't open the door.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.669
Thank you, appreciate it.

31:16.351 --> 31:19.121
Hello.

31:19.154 --> 31:20.723
Yes.

31:20.757 --> 31:22.558
There's been an accident.

31:38.574 --> 31:41.578
Hope I wasn't interrupting
your evening with your wife.

31:44.647 --> 31:46.014
How much further?

31:48.350 --> 31:50.018
Not too much longer.

31:54.490 --> 31:56.091
You two been married long?

32:01.631 --> 32:03.198
I guess.

32:07.837 --> 32:10.572
Love of a good woman.

32:10.607 --> 32:12.374
It's a funny thing.

32:15.444 --> 32:16.746
How do you mean?

32:19.782 --> 32:23.185
My woman looks at me,

32:23.218 --> 32:25.420
there isn't anything
I wouldn't do for her.

32:27.724 --> 32:29.424
Know what I mean?

32:35.430 --> 32:37.199
There he is.

32:53.415 --> 32:56.151
Did you see any other vehicles?

32:56.184 --> 32:58.353
No.

33:01.891 --> 33:03.425
He's breathing.

33:05.895 --> 33:08.363
I gotta radio this in.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.100
Radio's out.

33:14.804 --> 33:16.314
We're gonna have to
take him back to the house.

33:16.338 --> 33:17.674
Give me a hand.

33:20.810 --> 33:22.579
Yeah.

33:56.779 --> 33:59.448
Yoo-hoo!

33:59.481 --> 34:02.317
I know you're in there.

34:02.351 --> 34:05.622
We got off on the wrong foot
back there at the diner.

34:07.890 --> 34:09.759
I feel real sorry about that.

34:11.761 --> 34:13.528
Hope I didn't scare you too bad.

34:18.200 --> 34:21.336
You wouldn't happen to have
something to drink, would you?

34:24.206 --> 34:26.274
Come on, I just want
something to drink.

34:28.243 --> 34:30.847
And I'll sit out here.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.750
You can wait inside
all by your pretty little self,

34:33.783 --> 34:35.450
I promise.

34:47.597 --> 34:49.632
We just got soda.

34:49.666 --> 34:51.934
That'll be fine.

35:05.882 --> 35:08.283
Ooh-wee.

35:08.316 --> 35:10.887
It's quite the fortress
you got here.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.823
He does like to keep you
locked away, doesn't he?

35:15.725 --> 35:17.459
Can't say I blame him.

35:32.008 --> 35:33.743
Goddamn.

35:33.776 --> 35:36.344
Not much of an outdoorsman,
are you?

35:36.378 --> 35:39.448
Well, I've spent most of my days
confined indoors.

35:41.017 --> 35:43.753
How long do you think
it'll take?

35:43.786 --> 35:47.623
Not much longer, I imagine.

35:49.324 --> 35:50.660
Mm!

35:52.862 --> 35:55.031
Why don't you come inside?

35:55.064 --> 35:58.533
I can't have you
bleeding to death out there.

36:16.318 --> 36:18.353
This place has
a lot of history, huh?

36:20.757 --> 36:22.959
It's not mine.

36:22.992 --> 36:24.627
Well, it's nice.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.029
Roomy.

36:27.063 --> 36:30.565
I keep telling Doug
I wanna get me a big place.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.835
I'm tired of small spaces.

36:36.505 --> 36:39.609
How long have you guys
known each other?

36:39.642 --> 36:41.644
We've spent some time together.

36:47.583 --> 36:49.652
But don't worry.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.386
Your man's gonna be okay.

36:52.922 --> 36:54.090
What are these?

36:56.058 --> 36:57.994
Pete's commendations.

37:00.462 --> 37:02.064
He's a real hero, huh?

37:05.067 --> 37:07.435
I always wanted to be a hero.

37:11.741 --> 37:14.811
There's lover boy now.

37:14.844 --> 37:16.545
Safe and sound.

37:22.785 --> 37:24.486
What happened?

37:24.519 --> 37:26.756
It's Walt, he's in bad shape.

37:26.789 --> 37:28.624
Go open the guest room.

38:02.524 --> 38:05.393
Help will be here soon.

38:05.427 --> 38:07.395
It'll be okay, just...

38:07.429 --> 38:08.698
just hang on.

38:08.731 --> 38:10.733
I don't know.

38:10.766 --> 38:13.970
Looks like he's not long
for this world.

38:14.003 --> 38:16.438
You guys mind
giving us a minute?

38:26.481 --> 38:29.484
- Is he gonna live?
- I don't know.

38:29.517 --> 38:33.189
Well, the police and EMT
should be here soon, so.

38:33.222 --> 38:37.093
I think those two men hit Walt.

38:37.126 --> 38:38.961
Why would they do that?

38:38.995 --> 38:41.697
Maybe he pulled them over,
busted them for possession.

38:41.731 --> 38:44.499
I don't know, the point is
they could do that to us.

38:46.202 --> 38:48.436
I need to get to my gun.

38:48.470 --> 38:50.940
Backup could take 30 minutes
to get up here.

38:50.973 --> 38:53.042
- Did you get my keys?
- No, I tried, but I...

38:53.075 --> 38:54.977
It's okay.

38:55.011 --> 38:56.188
I'm gonna need you
to distract them

38:56.212 --> 38:58.881
until I can get it.

38:58.915 --> 39:00.883
- How?
- Fix them leftovers.

39:00.917 --> 39:02.127
Make them something to drink,
I don't know, something

39:02.151 --> 39:04.954
until I can get my weapon.

39:04.987 --> 39:06.589
Hey,

39:06.622 --> 39:08.858
it's gonna be okay.

39:08.891 --> 39:10.458
Trust me.

39:18.768 --> 39:20.736
Why didn't you
take him out on the road?

39:20.770 --> 39:22.939
I was about to,
then that cop started breathing.

39:22.972 --> 39:24.472
Nah, you pussied out.

39:24.506 --> 39:26.541
- Shut up, JB.
- All because you know...

39:26.574 --> 39:28.678
I said, "Shut up!"

39:42.925 --> 39:45.127
What are we gonna do now?

39:45.161 --> 39:48.631
What do you think?

39:48.664 --> 39:52.001
- But...
- What?

39:52.034 --> 39:54.603
- The gun is gone.
- What do you mean it's gone?

39:54.637 --> 39:58.040
It must've fallen out
when we were moving the body.

39:58.074 --> 40:01.110
- I told you this, I said...
- Say it, see what happens.

40:10.653 --> 40:13.189
Is he gonna make it?

40:13.222 --> 40:16.225
EMTs and state
should be here any minute.

40:16.258 --> 40:19.128
Oh, that's good.

40:19.161 --> 40:20.796
Real good.

40:20.830 --> 40:22.631
So, you two can be on your way.

40:24.633 --> 40:28.570
If it's all the same,
we'd like to stay.

40:28.604 --> 40:30.606
We feel kind of responsible
being as we're the ones

40:30.639 --> 40:32.241
- who found him.
- We'll be real upset

40:32.274 --> 40:35.244
not knowing how it turned out.

40:35.277 --> 40:36.946
We don't wanna impose
on your hospitality,

40:36.979 --> 40:40.850
but you said
it'd just be a few minutes.

40:42.718 --> 40:44.887
We have leftovers,

40:44.920 --> 40:46.255
if you come this way.

40:49.091 --> 40:51.327
That sounds real good.

40:55.931 --> 40:57.266
Mind if I wash up?

40:59.068 --> 41:01.536
Don't wanna eat
with blood on my hands.

41:03.639 --> 41:06.042
Bathroom's that way.

42:35.965 --> 42:38.667
Doug?

42:38.701 --> 42:39.935
Yeah?

42:39.969 --> 42:41.370
You need to get back.

43:04.393 --> 43:06.962
You know I tried
to wash my hands, but...

43:06.996 --> 43:09.165
Our well is out.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.301
Hm.

43:14.904 --> 43:16.372
Maybe we can help you out
with that

43:16.405 --> 43:18.908
after the cavalry turns up.

43:20.075 --> 43:23.012
When is that again?

43:23.045 --> 43:24.213
Any minute now.

43:33.055 --> 43:34.924
Oh, hey, let me give you
a hand with that.

43:34.957 --> 43:36.192
I'm fine.

43:36.225 --> 43:38.127
Okay.

43:41.864 --> 43:45.935
JB, let the pretty lady
do her thing.

43:47.469 --> 43:49.405
All right.

44:02.885 --> 44:05.054
Allow me.

44:16.865 --> 44:20.069
Really lucky you two
being on the road when you were.

44:21.403 --> 44:23.072
Right place at the right time.

44:26.542 --> 44:29.345
This roast is delicious.

44:33.583 --> 44:35.784
You never said what you two
were doing in these parts.

44:35.818 --> 44:37.419
Work.

44:40.389 --> 44:43.259
What kind of work
would that be exactly?

44:43.292 --> 44:45.961
You ask a lot of questions.

44:45.995 --> 44:48.897
Pete's in law enforcement.

44:50.132 --> 44:51.500
Is that right?

44:53.202 --> 44:57.840
Looks like we're in
a complementary field.

45:03.212 --> 45:04.880
What's so funny?

45:09.485 --> 45:11.320
Should we let them in
on the joke?

45:14.490 --> 45:15.958
We're here to kill you.

46:00.102 --> 46:01.870
Is he dead?

46:03.939 --> 46:06.542
Oh, he's dead.

46:32.635 --> 46:34.604
What do you got there, darling?

48:25.113 --> 48:28.116
Well, come on, coppy.

48:28.150 --> 48:31.621
We both know you've reached
the end of the road.

48:31.654 --> 48:35.290
Bet you can see
that white light even.

48:35.324 --> 48:38.260
Next stop, adios, partner.

48:45.501 --> 48:47.637
Don't feel bad.

48:47.670 --> 48:50.607
We all end up there
sooner or later.

48:53.610 --> 48:56.679
Just trying to hang on.

48:56.713 --> 49:00.516
The cosmos is working
against you.

49:03.552 --> 49:05.722
That's a good boy.

49:10.225 --> 49:12.060
You hear that?

49:13.663 --> 49:16.833
That's the sound
of two lovers reunited.

49:16.866 --> 49:21.236
The most powerful force
in the universe.

49:21.270 --> 49:24.306
Date with destiny
you might call it.

49:24.339 --> 49:27.576
You and me,
we're just collateral damage.

49:28.878 --> 49:31.113
Two guys looking out
for our buddies.

49:31.146 --> 49:36.084
Sometimes that means
making a little sacrifice.

49:40.489 --> 49:45.260
Now, you might not think it,
but I done me some reading.

49:45.294 --> 49:48.430
I told Doug what Socrates said.

49:48.463 --> 49:50.265
You know Socrates?

49:50.299 --> 49:52.200
Mm?

49:52.234 --> 49:56.438
He's a big thinker
from the olden days.

49:58.608 --> 50:02.745
Socrates said the hottest love

50:02.779 --> 50:05.113
has the coldest end.

50:05.147 --> 50:08.685
I tried to warn Doug

50:08.718 --> 50:13.188
about how dangerous affairs
of the heart can be.

50:13.221 --> 50:17.359
But the heart wants
what that heart wants.

50:21.664 --> 50:24.667
Look at me running off
at my mouth.

50:26.836 --> 50:28.838
I'm sorry about that.

50:37.814 --> 50:40.148
Any last words

50:40.182 --> 50:43.653
before you're off
to the bone garden?

50:43.686 --> 50:45.354
It's...

50:47.322 --> 50:51.894
It's Socrates...

50:51.928 --> 50:53.696
moron.

51:57.392 --> 52:01.263
Do you know how hard it was
being away from you?

52:01.296 --> 52:04.533
Locked up,
knowing you and him were...

52:04.566 --> 52:06.301
Shh.

52:21.784 --> 52:23.418
What's this?

52:23.452 --> 52:24.452
It's mine.

52:27.790 --> 52:29.491
What do you need that for?

52:29.524 --> 52:32.360
Just call it a backup plan.

52:33.730 --> 52:35.430
Baby, your husband's
life insurance

52:35.464 --> 52:37.499
is close to a million.

52:37.532 --> 52:40.036
With pension and benefits,
who knows?

52:41.503 --> 52:43.472
All the same.

52:43.505 --> 52:45.975
I'm gonna keep it.

52:46.008 --> 52:49.544
After all, a girl
has to look out for herself.

52:49.579 --> 52:52.514
- That's what I'm here for.
- In case you didn't notice,

52:52.547 --> 52:54.951
I don't need a man
to look after me.

52:56.886 --> 52:58.821
Well, that's true.

53:02.491 --> 53:04.060
Hey.

53:05.427 --> 53:07.462
Got a gift for you.

53:09.665 --> 53:10.665
Hm?

53:14.637 --> 53:16.505
Why would you do that?

53:18.775 --> 53:21.644
I... I thought you'd like it.

53:21.677 --> 53:23.478
What if you get caught?

53:24.847 --> 53:26.481
How's it gonna look
when the suspect

53:26.515 --> 53:27.850
has the name
of the victim's widow

53:27.884 --> 53:29.986
tattooed on his back?

53:31.621 --> 53:34.056
Baby, that's not gonna happen.

53:34.090 --> 53:36.558
And what about JB?

53:36.592 --> 53:38.360
What if he blabs?

53:38.393 --> 53:39.872
He's not all there,
in case you didn't notice.

53:39.896 --> 53:42.564
Well, I needed help.

53:42.598 --> 53:45.534
Oh, and... and all that shit
at the restaurant.

53:45.567 --> 53:47.670
You had to do it
in front of Walt?

53:47.703 --> 53:49.047
Okay, you said
to make it look good,

53:49.071 --> 53:50.082
like you were being stalked.

53:50.106 --> 53:53.042
Now he is bleeding to death
in my guest room.

53:53.075 --> 53:54.543
How is that part of the plan?

53:54.576 --> 53:57.379
Relax, baby.

53:57.412 --> 53:59.481
I'll fix this.

53:59.514 --> 54:01.684
Oh, you'll fix this.

54:01.717 --> 54:02.685
You'll fix this?

54:02.718 --> 54:04.921
You sound like Pete.

54:24.674 --> 54:27.576
He's always trying
to fix things.

54:29.111 --> 54:30.847
The house,

54:30.880 --> 54:33.716
the well,

54:33.749 --> 54:35.785
our lives.

54:37.720 --> 54:42.158
But you can't fix things
if you never see clearly

54:42.191 --> 54:44.526
the way that life is.

54:45.895 --> 54:48.898
Or should be.

54:52.201 --> 54:56.706
One night I was driving home
from work,

54:56.739 --> 55:00.176
and I saw this coyote
on the side of the road.

55:00.209 --> 55:02.510
And it had something
in its mouth.

55:03.746 --> 55:06.082
And I stopped,

55:06.115 --> 55:10.418
and I watched this scrappy,

55:10.452 --> 55:12.554
wild-eyed coyote

55:12.588 --> 55:16.926
rip a sweet rabbit to pieces.

55:19.629 --> 55:22.464
And I didn't blame the coyote.

55:23.799 --> 55:26.068
It was just its nature.

55:27.904 --> 55:31.207
And that's when everything
came into focus for me.

55:33.508 --> 55:36.612
People always see me
as the rabbit.

55:37.980 --> 55:41.183
And I have played
that part perfectly.

55:43.219 --> 55:46.022
But I am not a rabbit, Doug.

55:48.024 --> 55:49.892
I am a coyote.

55:51.227 --> 55:55.197
And I will never be
a rabbit again.

56:07.610 --> 56:09.011
The well.

56:10.980 --> 56:14.016
We'll put Walt's body
in the well

56:14.050 --> 56:16.752
and we'll put the cap back on.

56:16.786 --> 56:19.889
The cops will have no reason
to look there.

56:19.922 --> 56:24.260
And in a little while,
JB and I will be gone.

56:24.293 --> 56:27.964
You'll be the surviving widow
of a home invasion.

56:31.100 --> 56:33.703
You have to make it look
convincing.

56:45.014 --> 56:47.750
Hey, we discussed this.

56:49.085 --> 56:53.255
If you don't,
nobody will believe me.

57:34.730 --> 57:36.732
Yeah?

57:36.766 --> 57:38.968
I'm sorry, I thought...

57:39.001 --> 57:42.004
- Is Beth here?
- Yeah, come on in.

57:45.808 --> 57:47.243
I'm JB.

57:47.276 --> 57:49.145
Pete's cousin.

57:49.178 --> 57:52.114
- What's your name?
- Ally.

57:53.783 --> 57:55.785
Ally.

57:55.818 --> 57:57.820
That's a pretty name.

57:57.853 --> 57:59.588
Thanks.

58:01.891 --> 58:03.292
Ally, I was about
to have me a beer.

58:03.325 --> 58:05.161
Care to join?

58:05.194 --> 58:06.295
You said Beth's home?

58:06.328 --> 58:08.664
Yeah, she's upstairs.

58:08.697 --> 58:11.801
I wouldn't disturb
two lovers, though.

58:11.834 --> 58:13.702
What brings you out here
so late?

58:13.736 --> 58:15.304
I have good news
I wanted to tell Beth.

58:15.337 --> 58:16.872
Oh, yeah? I like good news.

58:16.906 --> 58:20.042
Why don't you tell me?

58:20.076 --> 58:22.778
I can come back in the morning.

58:22.812 --> 58:24.280
Why don't you
just leave that here?

58:24.313 --> 58:26.649
I'll make sure she gets it.

58:29.718 --> 58:31.220
Oh, no, don't give it to me.

58:31.253 --> 58:34.156
I can't be trusted.

58:34.190 --> 58:35.200
Why don't you
just set it in there

58:35.224 --> 58:37.693
on the dining room table?

58:37.726 --> 58:39.995
Then I can leave.

58:40.029 --> 58:41.997
Cross my heart.

58:44.100 --> 58:46.969
Oh, and don't be disturbed
by the mess in there.

58:47.002 --> 58:49.271
We had ourselves
a little bit of a party.

59:01.117 --> 59:02.360
I left the envelope
on the table.

59:02.384 --> 59:04.753
- Tell Beth I stopped by.
- Oh, not so fast.

59:04.787 --> 59:07.656
Please, you said I could go.

59:13.696 --> 59:15.397
Fuck!

59:20.469 --> 59:21.904
Ally.

59:26.909 --> 59:29.278
Are you okay?

59:29.311 --> 59:31.147
What are you doing here?

59:33.182 --> 59:34.717
I wanted to show you.

59:34.750 --> 59:37.186
Wanted to bring this by for you.

59:46.228 --> 59:48.164
A boy.

59:48.197 --> 59:50.299
How wonderful.

59:50.332 --> 59:51.834
Where's Pete?

59:51.867 --> 59:54.236
Oh, he was just about
to take a shower.

59:55.738 --> 59:58.274
I... I see you met JB,

59:58.307 --> 1:00:00.776
one of Pete's army buddies.

1:00:00.809 --> 1:00:02.144
Quite a hero.

1:00:02.178 --> 1:00:04.713
Really?

1:00:04.747 --> 1:00:06.448
Tell her, JB.

1:00:08.217 --> 1:00:10.853
Yeah, well...

1:00:10.886 --> 1:00:12.955
Yeah, well, I don't know.

1:00:12.988 --> 1:00:16.425
I did a couple tours
in Afghanistan,

1:00:16.458 --> 1:00:19.395
saw my fair share of combat.

1:00:19.428 --> 1:00:22.331
Even got me a few commendations.

1:00:23.365 --> 1:00:26.268
I was just doing my duty.

1:00:26.302 --> 1:00:28.737
Hey, I'm gonna be in town
a little while,

1:00:28.771 --> 1:00:31.941
maybe the three of us and Pete

1:00:31.974 --> 1:00:34.276
all go out sometime.

1:00:34.310 --> 1:00:36.212
I'm not sure that Ally
should be going out

1:00:36.245 --> 1:00:38.080
given her condition.

1:00:38.113 --> 1:00:40.849
She got herself
all the way up here.

1:00:42.218 --> 1:00:45.421
Which is why
we should let her go.

1:00:51.527 --> 1:00:53.996
It was nice meeting you.

1:01:00.269 --> 1:01:03.005
Well, congratulations
to you and Buddy.

1:01:03.038 --> 1:01:03.839
Are you sure you're all right?

1:01:03.872 --> 1:01:06.442
I can call the police.

1:01:06.475 --> 1:01:10.346
I know JB is strange,
but he is harmless.

1:01:10.379 --> 1:01:12.248
Really.

1:01:12.281 --> 1:01:13.949
I'm fine.

1:01:25.094 --> 1:01:26.061
Hey!

1:01:26.095 --> 1:01:27.863
Come.

1:01:29.198 --> 1:01:31.066
We got a big problem, man.

1:01:34.303 --> 1:01:35.347
I thought you said he was dead.

1:01:35.371 --> 1:01:36.839
Do I look like a doctor to you?

1:01:38.307 --> 1:01:39.275
He couldn't have gone far.

1:01:39.308 --> 1:01:40.843
I knew this plan was cursed.

1:01:40.876 --> 1:01:42.344
It's time to cut our losses,
Dougie.

1:01:42.378 --> 1:01:43.345
What are you saying?

1:01:43.379 --> 1:01:45.014
Come on, man.

1:01:45.047 --> 1:01:47.416
The cop, that woman,
her husband out there.

1:01:47.449 --> 1:01:49.518
Your pretty little miss
is at the center of this.

1:01:49.551 --> 1:01:51.320
That piece of ass
is gonna be the end of us.

1:01:51.353 --> 1:01:53.322
Mm-mm, we stick to the plan.

1:01:53.355 --> 1:01:56.593
Plan? There ain't no plan
anymore.

1:01:58.193 --> 1:02:02.064
I understand
affairs of the heart and all,

1:02:02.097 --> 1:02:05.200
so if it's easier for you,
you handle the husband.

1:02:05.234 --> 1:02:07.903
I'll take care of Miss Beth.

1:02:09.571 --> 1:02:10.839
Hm?

1:02:10.873 --> 1:02:12.875
What's it gonna be, man?

1:02:16.245 --> 1:02:17.246
Shit.

1:02:17.279 --> 1:02:18.514
He's outside.

1:02:18.547 --> 1:02:21.183
That son of a bitch is outside.

1:02:31.327 --> 1:02:32.494
Bastard.

1:02:32.528 --> 1:02:35.064
What the hell is wrong with you?

1:02:35.097 --> 1:02:38.167
- She's about to have a baby.
- Don't hit me.

1:02:39.201 --> 1:02:41.270
Let me go.

1:02:41.303 --> 1:02:43.172
You're hurting me.

1:02:43.205 --> 1:02:44.282
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:02:44.306 --> 1:02:46.308
We don't have time for this.

1:02:46.342 --> 1:02:47.376
Pete's outside.

1:02:47.409 --> 1:02:48.645
What?

1:02:48.678 --> 1:02:50.045
How is that possible?
I saw him...

1:02:50.079 --> 1:02:51.914
Fuck what you saw, he's alive.

1:02:51.947 --> 1:02:53.315
But he's hurt.

1:02:53.349 --> 1:02:54.651
You said this would be clean.

1:02:54.684 --> 1:02:56.586
- This is not clean, Doug.
- Relax, baby.

1:02:56.619 --> 1:02:58.153
We'll get him,
I just need you to...

1:03:00.089 --> 1:03:02.057
What the hell?

1:03:02.091 --> 1:03:04.059
The fucker's hit
the panic button.

1:03:04.093 --> 1:03:05.561
Shit.

1:03:05.595 --> 1:03:06.595
You need to shut it off.

1:03:12.034 --> 1:03:13.435
Shit.

1:03:13.469 --> 1:03:14.946
If you don't shut it off
in the next 30 seconds,

1:03:14.970 --> 1:03:15.938
the cops will be called.

1:03:15.971 --> 1:03:17.306
Do you understand?

1:03:20.109 --> 1:03:22.044
Shit!

1:03:23.278 --> 1:03:25.481
Come on, concentrate, baby.

1:03:25.514 --> 1:03:27.249
Okay?

1:03:33.522 --> 1:03:35.424
Yes!

1:03:37.326 --> 1:03:40.062
Ooh, that's what
I'm talking about.

1:03:40.095 --> 1:03:41.230
Wait, put me down.

1:03:41.263 --> 1:03:42.998
- Put me down.
- Huh?

1:03:46.703 --> 1:03:49.471
Dammit, Doug, he's got his gun.

1:03:52.107 --> 1:03:53.409
We'll get him.

1:03:53.442 --> 1:03:55.645
No, he could be using
his police radio.

1:03:57.413 --> 1:03:59.448
This is Car 83.

1:03:59.481 --> 1:04:01.584
Request...

1:04:01.618 --> 1:04:03.285
Officer in distress.

1:04:03.318 --> 1:04:05.020
He's in his car.

1:04:17.199 --> 1:04:18.701
Pete.

1:04:21.570 --> 1:04:23.405
I know you're out here.

1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:27.976
Things got a little out of hand.

1:04:33.783 --> 1:04:36.985
Look, we both want
the same thing.

1:04:37.019 --> 1:04:39.188
You want us out.

1:04:39.221 --> 1:04:41.190
We want to get out.

1:04:44.526 --> 1:04:47.196
I've got your wife.

1:04:49.431 --> 1:04:52.100
She sure is pretty, ain't she?

1:04:54.102 --> 1:04:57.272
Be a shame if something
were to happen to her.

1:05:02.344 --> 1:05:06.215
You trust me and I'll trust you.

1:05:11.688 --> 1:05:14.389
So much for trust.

1:05:14.423 --> 1:05:16.191
JB?

1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:20.496
JB?

1:05:20.529 --> 1:05:22.064
Fuck.

1:05:27.436 --> 1:05:29.104
My ear, man.

1:05:29.137 --> 1:05:32.809
He shot my fucking ear off!

1:05:34.844 --> 1:05:36.746
I'll be right back.

1:05:36.779 --> 1:05:39.582
I'm bleeding real bad here, man.

1:05:40.850 --> 1:05:43.720
No one dies from a missing ear.

1:05:43.753 --> 1:05:47.089
You can't just
fucking leave me here.

1:05:48.725 --> 1:05:51.126
Doug!

1:05:51.159 --> 1:05:52.729
I'll be right back, okay?

1:05:52.762 --> 1:05:54.664
Shit!

1:05:54.697 --> 1:05:56.833
Okay?

1:05:59.468 --> 1:06:01.069
Thanks, man.

1:06:09.812 --> 1:06:11.313
Doug.

1:06:12.615 --> 1:06:14.116
I heard shots.

1:06:14.149 --> 1:06:16.385
- He came out and just shot JB.
- Is JB...

1:06:16.418 --> 1:06:17.529
I don't know.
He's still out there.

1:06:17.553 --> 1:06:19.656
You left him out there?

1:06:19.689 --> 1:06:21.724
- I need a gun.
- You just left JB out there.

1:06:21.758 --> 1:06:24.794
Your husband's a cop, he has
to have more than one gun.

1:06:26.295 --> 1:06:27.764
Well, that's Pete's.

1:06:27.797 --> 1:06:30.667
I've tried to get in,
but you... you can't.

1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:33.335
You got a tool box?

1:07:00.162 --> 1:07:01.406
- What the hell are these?
- Nothing.

1:07:01.430 --> 1:07:05.233
They're letters that I wrote
to Pete when he was on tour.

1:07:05.267 --> 1:07:08.170
This is what he's been
keeping from you?

1:07:19.281 --> 1:07:21.149
He knows.

1:07:23.218 --> 1:07:25.888
He's known this whole time.

1:07:27.857 --> 1:07:29.692
What are you talking about?

1:07:31.226 --> 1:07:32.829
This is us at the lake.

1:07:34.463 --> 1:07:35.898
How the hell did he get this?

1:07:35.932 --> 1:07:37.767
I thought...

1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:40.335
I don't know,
I thought I burned it.

1:07:40.369 --> 1:07:42.672
What do you mean
you thought you did?

1:07:42.705 --> 1:07:44.439
After all the planning? How...

1:07:44.473 --> 1:07:46.508
How could you be so careless?

1:07:46.541 --> 1:07:48.611
I don't know, Doug.

1:07:48.645 --> 1:07:50.713
It doesn't matter now.

1:07:50.747 --> 1:07:53.215
He found it.

1:07:53.248 --> 1:07:55.350
The plan's fucked.

1:07:59.488 --> 1:08:01.490
Where are you going?

1:08:01.523 --> 1:08:03.225
We gotta get out of here.

1:08:14.269 --> 1:08:15.772
What's going on?

1:08:15.805 --> 1:08:18.273
The pension, the insurance,
it's all gone.

1:08:18.306 --> 1:08:19.274
We gotta get out of here.

1:08:19.307 --> 1:08:21.309
Why are you panicking?

1:08:21.343 --> 1:08:23.946
That picture is from months ago.

1:08:23.980 --> 1:08:25.480
He's made a fool out of me.

1:08:25.514 --> 1:08:26.949
He's made a fool
out of both of us.

1:08:26.983 --> 1:08:28.393
He doesn't know
it's me in that photo.

1:08:28.417 --> 1:08:29.561
If he did, he would have
recognized me

1:08:29.585 --> 1:08:30.552
when I first showed up.

1:08:30.586 --> 1:08:32.487
Who knows who he's told.

1:08:32.521 --> 1:08:34.456
He hasn't told anyone.

1:08:34.489 --> 1:08:36.491
How do you know that?

1:08:37.827 --> 1:08:39.662
He loves you.

1:08:41.496 --> 1:08:42.574
Kind of guy
who keeps these around

1:08:42.598 --> 1:08:43.532
doesn't want
anyone else to know.

1:08:43.565 --> 1:08:45.567
He doesn't blame you,
he blames himself.

1:08:45.601 --> 1:08:47.804
Yeah, well, I blame him, too.

1:08:47.837 --> 1:08:50.606
What the hell did he think
was gonna happen?

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:52.274
Making me a prisoner
in my own home

1:08:52.307 --> 1:08:53.484
while he's halfway
around the world

1:08:53.508 --> 1:08:55.510
like some caged animal.

1:08:55.544 --> 1:08:58.815
You know what a caged animal
wants more than anything?

1:08:58.848 --> 1:09:00.583
Do you, baby?

1:09:00.616 --> 1:09:02.451
To escape.

1:09:04.887 --> 1:09:06.823
It ends tonight.

1:09:08.490 --> 1:09:10.425
Listen.

1:09:10.459 --> 1:09:11.594
You're not thinking clearly.

1:09:11.627 --> 1:09:14.396
No, I can finish him.

1:09:14.429 --> 1:09:16.264
No. You were right.

1:09:16.298 --> 1:09:17.910
Let's just forget all this,
let's get out of here.

1:09:17.934 --> 1:09:20.737
And leave with nothing?

1:09:20.770 --> 1:09:22.038
So what are you saying?

1:09:22.071 --> 1:09:25.440
I'm saying I can get him
to trust me.

1:09:25.474 --> 1:09:27.710
He'll believe anything
I tell him.

1:09:27.744 --> 1:09:29.645
How do you know?

1:09:31.714 --> 1:09:33.381
You said it yourself.

1:09:33.415 --> 1:09:35.051
He loves me.

1:10:41.083 --> 1:10:42.484
Who is it?

1:10:42.517 --> 1:10:44.754
Pete or JB?

1:10:44.787 --> 1:10:46.454
Can't tell.

1:10:47.957 --> 1:10:50.726
We gotta keep a level head.

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:52.862
Okay?

1:11:09.111 --> 1:11:10.880
Pete.

1:11:19.622 --> 1:11:21.057
Pete.

1:11:23.726 --> 1:11:25.962
Are you okay?

1:11:33.002 --> 1:11:35.037
It's me, don't scream.

1:11:39.075 --> 1:11:41.409
I thought you were dead.

1:11:42.979 --> 1:11:45.014
What did they do to you?

1:11:46.716 --> 1:11:49.085
He tried to rape me.

1:11:49.118 --> 1:11:51.419
I stabbed him.

1:11:51.453 --> 1:11:53.421
You killed him?

1:11:55.157 --> 1:11:57.159
I'll show you.

1:11:59.228 --> 1:12:01.130
He's up here.

1:12:06.636 --> 1:12:07.670
Where are they?

1:12:10.572 --> 1:12:12.909
Everybody's dead.

1:12:12.942 --> 1:12:14.176
Not them.

1:12:14.210 --> 1:12:16.846
The police, the ambulance.

1:12:16.879 --> 1:12:19.181
Where are they?

1:12:19.215 --> 1:12:20.448
I don't know.

1:12:23.586 --> 1:12:25.855
You called for help.

1:12:25.888 --> 1:12:26.923
Right?

1:12:26.956 --> 1:12:28.858
Of course.

1:12:38.034 --> 1:12:39.534
Pete.

1:12:39.567 --> 1:12:40.970
What is it?

1:12:42.672 --> 1:12:45.808
Tell me again what happened
between you and him.

1:12:45.841 --> 1:12:48.210
I told you.

1:12:48.244 --> 1:12:50.680
I killed him.

1:12:50.713 --> 1:12:52.581
How'd you do it?

1:12:53.849 --> 1:12:55.885
Do what?

1:12:55.918 --> 1:12:58.955
Get him to trust you.

1:12:58.988 --> 1:13:01.791
Pete.

1:13:01.824 --> 1:13:03.826
You put down your gun.

1:13:07.897 --> 1:13:09.531
It's scaring me.

1:13:09.564 --> 1:13:11.634
Why?

1:13:11.667 --> 1:13:13.501
You've seen me
with a gun before.

1:13:14.971 --> 1:13:18.007
You're not seeing things
clearly.

1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:27.583
I think for the first time

1:13:27.616 --> 1:13:30.653
I'm seeing things
exactly as they are.

1:13:47.069 --> 1:13:49.071
Who is he, Beth?

1:14:09.125 --> 1:14:10.826
Beth.

1:14:18.034 --> 1:14:20.002
Beth.

1:15:36.112 --> 1:15:37.713
Beth.

1:15:43.953 --> 1:15:46.088
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:16:02.071 --> 1:16:03.672
Beth!

1:17:00.763 --> 1:17:03.165
You're hurt.

1:17:03.199 --> 1:17:05.334
How long have you known?

1:17:09.505 --> 1:17:12.174
It doesn't matter.

1:17:12.208 --> 1:17:15.844
What kind of man
knows his wife is cheating

1:17:15.878 --> 1:17:19.248
and doesn't say anything,

1:17:19.281 --> 1:17:22.017
doesn't ask why?

1:17:23.919 --> 1:17:26.989
You know why I married you?

1:17:27.022 --> 1:17:29.391
I needed a new life.

1:17:29.425 --> 1:17:32.194
One where I could see the world.

1:17:32.228 --> 1:17:35.030
And then you left.

1:17:35.064 --> 1:17:39.001
And I was stuck
in this dead-end town

1:17:39.034 --> 1:17:42.071
right back where I started.

1:17:42.104 --> 1:17:43.772
And then when Doug came around,

1:17:43.806 --> 1:17:46.809
I prayed you would
never come back.

1:17:46.842 --> 1:17:49.278
And when you did,
you locked me up

1:17:49.311 --> 1:17:52.047
and you penned me
like an animal!

1:17:52.081 --> 1:17:53.482
I wanted to protect you.

1:17:53.515 --> 1:17:55.384
Bullshit.

1:17:55.417 --> 1:17:59.421
You stuck your head in the sand
afraid I'd leave you.

1:17:59.455 --> 1:18:01.190
Beth.

1:18:01.223 --> 1:18:03.292
Listen.

1:18:03.325 --> 1:18:06.262
I can fix this.

1:18:06.295 --> 1:18:08.831
You can't fix this.

1:18:10.466 --> 1:18:13.435
I want more.

1:18:14.937 --> 1:18:16.972
More what?

1:18:18.507 --> 1:18:20.909
More...

1:18:24.146 --> 1:18:26.448
than you!

1:19:19.301 --> 1:19:21.036
And now, breaking news.

1:19:21.070 --> 1:19:23.205
We're getting reports
of a gruesome home invasion

1:19:23.238 --> 1:19:26.609
in rural Virginia with perhaps
as many as four people dead.

1:19:26.643 --> 1:19:28.410
Local police
are describing the crime

1:19:28.444 --> 1:19:31.146
as one of a brutal
and savage nature.

1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:33.015
Our reporters are on their way
to the scene

1:19:33.048 --> 1:19:35.017
to bring you live coverage.

1:19:35.050 --> 1:19:36.385
Stay tuned after the break

1:19:36.418 --> 1:19:38.387
for today's winning
lottery numbers.
