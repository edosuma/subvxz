00:13.138 --> 00:15.098
- (Hammond) Come in.
- General.

00:15.182 --> 00:19.561
I'd like to talk to you about this mission
upon which we're about to embark.

00:19.645 --> 00:23.690
It seems... a bit ridiculous, doesn't it?

00:23.774 --> 00:26.944
Have you met General Ryan?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.321
Hello, Colonel.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.907
The General Ryan? Chief of Staff?

00:31.990 --> 00:34.451
That's right.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.830
Shouldn't there have been
a memo or something?

00:38.914 --> 00:40.958
You were off world.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.085
Yeah.

00:43.210 --> 00:48.090
So, what brings you
to our little secret base, sir?

00:48.173 --> 00:52.803
That would be the ridiculous
mission you just mentioned.

00:54.471 --> 00:58.475
- Of course.
- I'm proposing that M4C-862 become...

00:58.559 --> 01:01.979
..a permanent research station.
I'd like you to make an assessment.

01:02.104 --> 01:05.774
- The General Ryan?
- I've read a lot about you, Colonel.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.318
In General Hammond's reports.

01:09.945 --> 01:13.782
- Yes, sir?
- Thus far we like your work.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.286
Thank you, sir. I like yours.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.705
Your air force. The air force.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.124
I love the air force.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.668
Anything else, Colonel?

01:24.793 --> 01:30.632
No, sir. Well, actually, I'd like to know
how Daniel and Carter got out of this...

01:30.757 --> 01:33.051
..very important mission.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.138
Dr Jackson is off world with SG-1 1 .

01:36.221 --> 01:41.185
Major Carter's giving a lecture at
the academy in theoretical astrophysics.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.604
If you'd care to take her place...

01:43.687 --> 01:45.981
No.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.026
- Then you're dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.570
Sirs. Both of you.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.413
Got your hands full with that one,
eh, George?

02:02.206 --> 02:04.833
So, as a result of
these modular functions,...

02:04.917 --> 02:10.130
..the unwanted variables are always
expressed as multiples of N minus ten.

02:10.255 --> 02:14.176
Therefore, if we assume the existence
of ten dimensions in space-time,...

02:14.301 --> 02:18.138
..the variables are cancelled out
and the calculations begin to make sense.

02:18.263 --> 02:22.476
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did you say ten dimensions?

02:23.101 --> 02:26.104
Yes, I did.

02:26.188 --> 02:29.441
Look, I realise these concepts
are a little bizarre,...

02:29.525 --> 02:32.319
..and that many of you would
rather be somewhere else:

02:32.402 --> 02:35.989
..jump school, flight training...
Believe me, I know.

02:36.073 --> 02:40.619
I used to sit in those chairs
and listen to the same boring lectures.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.956
No offence, Professor.

02:45.249 --> 02:50.212
But the aerodynamics that are one day
going to allow you to fly an F-22...

02:50.295 --> 02:53.382
..started out as squiggles
on a board just like this one.

02:53.465 --> 02:57.302
These calculations are the key
to opening up the entire universe.

02:57.386 --> 03:01.139
Wormholes and hyperspace
may seem like science fiction,...

03:01.223 --> 03:05.769
..but take my word for it: the future
is a lot closer than you might think.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.542
Guess that wasn't so bad.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.045
No, no. You actually made
the topological configuration...

03:32.171 --> 03:35.507
..of multiple dimension seem interesting.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.635
This is wrong.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.556
What's that, Cadet?

03:43.473 --> 03:47.853
I'm sorry, sir,
but the calculations are incorrect.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.440
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but wait until you graduate...

03:51.523 --> 03:55.527
..before you criticise the work
of a leader in the field of astrophysics.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.654
Yes, sir, of course.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.240
My apologies, ma'am.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.459
Who was that?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.669
Jennifer Hailey.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.507
Very intelligent, but... difficult personality.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.220
Well, she's right.

04:22.346 --> 04:26.099
- Really?
- These variables should be reversed.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.687
- I didn't even notice.
- Neither did l.

05:43.719 --> 05:47.139
- Colonel.
- (O'Neill) Major. Report?

05:47.222 --> 05:49.433
We've had a pretty thrilling week!

05:49.558 --> 05:52.728
Two days ago
Dr Thompson lost his glasses,...

05:52.853 --> 05:56.899
..and just this morning
the electron microscope broke down.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.109
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.278
Nonstop excitement.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.532
Well, we'll take it from here.
You're relieved.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.076
- Yes, sir.
- Major Griff?

06:09.328 --> 06:11.371
Dr Hamilton.

06:12.247 --> 06:17.294
Do you realise we still haven't received
those parts for the backup generator?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.005
I put the requisition in three days ago.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.008
Well, that's just not good enough.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.595
We obviously need to have a serious talk
about our supply procedure.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.349
Well, unfortunately, Doctor,
I've just been relieved, but...

06:30.474 --> 06:34.853
..l'm sure Colonel O'Neill
would love to discuss it with you.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.857
Love is the word.

06:38.982 --> 06:43.111
Colonel O'Neill, is it? I don't know
if this is a military thing generally...

06:43.195 --> 06:46.865
..or Major Griff's incompetence,
but I can't get anything I ask for.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.458
- (knocking)
- Come.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.006
Samantha. Sam. Good to see you again.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.884
Come in. Sit down, sit down.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.720
It's good to see you too, sir. Thank you.

07:09.972 --> 07:15.018
Well, well, well. So, how was the lecture?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.521
Well, no one fell asleep.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.065
- Very impressive.
- Thank you, sir.

07:20.190 --> 07:24.653
I did have an interesting encounter
with one of your cadets. Jennifer Hailey.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.739
Caught your eye, did she?
I thought she might.

07:28.365 --> 07:32.661
She pointed out a mistake in an equation
that changed the result completely.

07:32.744 --> 07:36.498
- I couldn't believe it.
- Here. Give this a read.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.920
Once you brush the chip
off her shoulder,...

07:42.004 --> 07:45.757
..she reminds me of another bright cadet
who came here a few years back.

07:45.841 --> 07:49.011
I've no idea who you're talking about, sir.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.763
Cadet Hailey is a very
smart young woman.

07:51.847 --> 07:55.100
Her SATs were through the roof -
even higher than yours.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.729
Unfortunately, she's sometimes
too smart for her own damn good.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.648
Professor Monroe said
she has discipline problems.

08:01.732 --> 08:06.778
The kid's bored. Came here for
a challenge, but it's not enough for her.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.823
Not enough?
This is just the beginning of her career.

08:09.907 --> 08:14.620
- How could she know what's ahead?
- I know, but she doesn't see it, Sam.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.414
Don't get me wrong. I see her potential.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.375
Her physical skills are terrific,
despite her size.

08:20.459 --> 08:23.128
She's an expert marksman,
a superb glider pilot.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.756
But that's not all there is
to becoming an officer.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.300
If she keeps insisting on
doing things her way...

08:28.383 --> 08:30.928
I'd like to talk to her, sir, if that's OK.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.601
I was hoping you'd say that.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.940
- Who said that?
- He did.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.067
Oh, for...

08:47.069 --> 08:49.112
Colonel O'Neill?

08:50.906 --> 08:56.495
Dr Lee tells me you've denied our request
to conduct a survey of the cave network.

08:56.578 --> 09:00.499
No. I just asked him to wait until
I could have a chance to check it out.

09:00.624 --> 09:05.003
- With no regard for our timetable.
- None whatsoever.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.965
Colonel, what exactly
do you expect to find in there?

09:08.048 --> 09:11.385
Look, Doctor, this is another planet.

09:11.510 --> 09:15.973
Actually, it's a moon.
We're orbiting that gas giant.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.686
Oh, well, if it's a moon,...

09:20.769 --> 09:24.273
..go ahead, do whatever you want(!)
What could happen?

09:24.398 --> 09:27.734
Colonel, this outpost has been
up and running for six weeks...

09:27.818 --> 09:32.197
..without the slightest hint
of anything remotely dangerous.

09:32.322 --> 09:37.119
You can explore the caves
once they've been checked out.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.997
Any more pressing matters?

09:41.456 --> 09:44.126
None whatsoever.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.175
Oh, yeah?

10:14.990 --> 10:17.659
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Major Carter.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.786
At ease, Cadet.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.711
Getting in a little extra lab time?

10:27.794 --> 10:30.088
Yes, ma'am.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.592
I wanted to talk to you about the paper
you did for Professor Monroe.

10:33.717 --> 10:37.304
"Towards a New Cosmology
of Multiple Realities."

10:37.387 --> 10:41.141
- It's an interesting topic.
- Professor Monroe gave me a D.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.269
Because it wasn't the assignment.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.855
Permission to speak freely, ma'am?

10:48.232 --> 10:50.901
The assignment was lame.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.529
Maybe it was, but it was the assignment.

10:54.780 --> 10:58.367
- Did you read it anyway?
- Matter of fact, I did.

10:58.492 --> 11:03.121
- It's intriguing.
- The same word Professor Monroe used.

11:03.205 --> 11:07.835
Maybe because that's what it is:
an intriguing idea.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.256
But it's based on too many unfounded
assumptions to make a valid theory.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.467
For example, you assume
that matter can travel both ways...

11:15.592 --> 11:17.469
..through an open wormhole.

11:17.553 --> 11:20.222
- So?
- So how do you know?

11:21.056 --> 11:24.059
Until somebody shows me
a wormhole that can only go one way...

11:24.184 --> 11:27.688
That's not the point.
You made an assumption.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.525
What about your assumption, Major?

11:32.818 --> 11:35.112
That you're right and I'm wrong?

11:35.195 --> 11:40.158
That paper is way, way beyond anything
you're likely to be taught at the academy.

11:40.284 --> 11:43.704
And if you want points for it,
hey, we're all impressed.

11:43.787 --> 11:47.040
It doesn't mean
you don't do the assignment.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.043
I'm late for a class, ma'am.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.504
Am I dismissed?

11:52.588 --> 11:54.214
Yes.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.109
Hamilton.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.405
Colonel O'Neill. How are the caves?

12:19.573 --> 12:24.369
- Dark.
- No subterranean monsters, I assume?

12:24.453 --> 12:26.663
Not this time.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.957
Go ahead and do your survey.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.126
Thank you.

12:32.461 --> 12:38.967
- You are disappointed we found nothing.
- No, it's just... I wanted him to be wrong.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.512
Just so he'd... be wrong.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.307
And if he was wrong,
we'd have something to do.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.851
- I see.
- (tonal buzzing)

12:52.648 --> 12:55.108
Did you hear somethin'?

12:56.735 --> 12:59.196
Indeed.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.953
(tonal buzzing continues)

13:39.194 --> 13:42.364
I have never before
encountered anything like it.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.742
Cool.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.836
I didn't realise you were still here.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.630
I wanted to talk to you
about Cadet Hailey's paper.

13:58.714 --> 14:01.341
- Sam...
- Look, at first I agreed with you.

14:01.425 --> 14:04.928
It just didn't add up. But something
about it kept nagging at me.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.556
I finally figured out what it was.

14:07.639 --> 14:12.019
The equations don't work unless you
allow for variations in the speed of light.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.521
Which is a universal constant.

14:14.646 --> 14:18.150
Not if the frame of reference
includes multiple universes.

14:18.275 --> 14:22.279
That's where this paper comes in.
I think, without even realising it,...

14:22.362 --> 14:26.992
..Cadet Hailey intuitively arrived at a
whole new way of looking at cosmology.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.786
Under certain special circumstances,...

14:29.870 --> 14:34.917
..what we would see as
an effect preceding a cause...

14:38.128 --> 14:44.801
..would in fact be an effect following
a cause... in a parallel reality.

14:44.885 --> 14:48.722
That's assuming that parallel
realities occasionally overlap.

14:48.805 --> 14:53.685
- I'm fairly confident that that's the case.
- Really? Why?

14:53.810 --> 14:59.149
I know she's got to you, but I think you're
trying to see something that isn't there.

14:59.233 --> 15:03.403
All right. Even if this theory
ultimately proves to be incorrect,...

15:03.487 --> 15:06.490
..you have to admit
that it's a brilliant insight.

15:06.615 --> 15:10.202
Jennifer Hailey is no longer our problem.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.833
- What do you mean?
- She got into a fight with another cadet.

15:17.209 --> 15:21.046
As fond as General Kerrigan is of her,
he'll have to expel her.

15:25.300 --> 15:29.221
- Are you sure this is such a good idea?
- I didn't come across the galaxy...

15:29.304 --> 15:32.391
- ..to wait for permission to do my job.
- Colonel O'Neill...

15:32.474 --> 15:35.310
He doesn't have a clue
what we're trying to accomplish.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.480
He's too busy polishing his M-16.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.066
Actually, it's a P-90.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.117
You boys goin' somewhere?

15:50.200 --> 15:55.080
Yes, we... we're gonna go see if we can
find that creature you encountered.

15:55.164 --> 15:57.916
Apparently you didn't hear me
the first time I told you -

15:58.000 --> 16:02.462
..clearly and in no uncertain terms -
not the heck yet.

16:02.546 --> 16:06.925
You know, if your description is correct,
we're talkin' about something...

16:07.009 --> 16:09.219
..that can pass through solid matter.

16:09.303 --> 16:13.599
Yes. And therefore, logically,
we'd have no defence against it.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.601
Typical military thinking.

16:15.684 --> 16:20.647
You encounter something you don't
understand, you assume it's a threat.

16:20.772 --> 16:25.319
Well...
until we determine there is no threat,...

16:25.402 --> 16:28.322
..l will assume there is one.

16:30.866 --> 16:36.622
- Do we have a problem here?
- Colonel, with all due respect, really,...

16:36.747 --> 16:41.043
..when I agreed to this assignment, I was
under the impression that I was in charge.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.545
You are in charge.

16:43.629 --> 16:46.798
Of the other scientists.

16:46.882 --> 16:50.636
That you even think you're qualified
to decide what we can and can't do...

16:50.761 --> 16:54.932
Colonel O'Neill is indeed qualified,
Dr Hamilton,...

16:55.015 --> 17:00.354
..having encountered many alien species
since long before you were born.

17:00.437 --> 17:04.107
I strongly suggest you do
what Colonel O'Neill says.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.986
Thank you, Rocco.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.782
Boys, we'll be in touch.

17:24.752 --> 17:30.759
Cadet Hailey was helping to train
an underclassman named Chloe Brown,...

17:30.884 --> 17:34.221
..who's been having problems
with her physical fitness tests.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.724
One of the cadre made a derogatory
comment about the young lady.

17:37.850 --> 17:42.396
- Cadet Hailey told him to knock it off.
- And when he didn't?

17:42.521 --> 17:44.898
- She broke his nose.
- She what?

17:46.650 --> 17:49.736
I can't let that go.
I don't give a damn how smart she is.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.948
- She was defending a fellow classmate.
- I know.

17:53.824 --> 17:56.910
I'm not asking for her
to go unpunished, sir,...

17:56.994 --> 18:01.290
..but if she's even half as brilliant as
I think she is, we don't wanna lose her.

18:01.373 --> 18:05.294
We're not here to advance theoretical
physics, but to defend this country.

18:05.377 --> 18:10.591
I understand that, sir,
but they're not mutually exclusive goals.

18:10.716 --> 18:16.388
Can I assume you're referring to your
research project at Cheyenne Mountain?

18:16.513 --> 18:20.017
- You can.
- Deep-space radar analysis, is it?

18:20.976 --> 18:23.645
Something like that, sir, yes.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.689
Mm.

18:25.772 --> 18:30.068
Well, I don't know what it really is
you're working on inside that mountain,...

18:30.152 --> 18:34.948
..but I do know if you've got something
to do with it, then it's high priority.

18:35.073 --> 18:38.494
Well, thank you, sir. It is.
And believe me when I tell you...

18:38.577 --> 18:42.748
..that Cadet Hailey is exactly
the kind of person we need.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.544
- She'll have to be punished.
- As she should be, sir.

18:47.628 --> 18:52.841
But I don't think she's about to go
on a rampage, beating up upperclassmen.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.468
(presses intercom)

18:54.593 --> 18:56.637
Send her in.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.565
Sir. Cadet Hailey reports as ordered.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.778
At ease. Major Carter?

19:13.946 --> 19:17.616
Cadet, I'd like to ask you
a few questions. Answer honestly.

19:17.699 --> 19:22.079
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.080
Ma'am?

19:23.163 --> 19:26.667
You think you're better than we are,
too good for the air force?

19:26.792 --> 19:29.503
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, come on.

19:29.586 --> 19:33.423
All those rules and regulations,
they don't really apply to you, right?

19:33.549 --> 19:37.803
What's the point of a chain of command
if your superiors aren't as smart as you?

19:37.886 --> 19:40.848
- I don't feel that way, ma'am.
- Oh, I think you do.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.809
And I think deep down you wanna leave.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.396
Let me do you a favour. The door's open.

19:47.521 --> 19:51.441
- Why don't you just quit and go home?
- No, ma'am. I won't quit.

19:51.525 --> 19:55.654
I'm giving you the chance to walk out
before General Kerrigan throws you out.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.781
I won't quit.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.910
Good.

20:05.622 --> 20:09.209
Cadet Hailey, as far as I'm concerned,...

20:09.334 --> 20:12.838
..you've demonstrated an inability
to be a functioning member...

20:12.921 --> 20:15.841
..of the United States Air Force.

20:15.924 --> 20:22.181
But Major Carter has a future in mind for
you, and I respect Major Carter's opinion.

20:22.264 --> 20:27.311
Although the rest of your punishment
stands, I'm not recommending dismissal.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.646
- Thank you, sir.
- You may go.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.329
Good luck.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.831
Hm.

20:53.879 --> 20:57.466
What were you thinking,
breaking the nose of an upperclassman?

20:57.549 --> 20:59.676
- Swing high.
- That's not funny.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.678
No, ma'am, you wouldn't think so.

21:01.762 --> 21:04.848
- What's this got to do with me?
- Everything.

21:04.973 --> 21:09.353
The great Samantha Carter. You think
a day goes by I don't hear your name?

21:09.436 --> 21:13.649
You've gotten the highest mark in every
class I've ever been in, won every award.

21:13.732 --> 21:16.026
They've compared me to you
since day one,...

21:16.151 --> 21:19.571
..and I never quite seem to measure up.

21:19.655 --> 21:24.284
That's it? What, so for the first time
in your life you come to a place...

21:24.368 --> 21:29.331
..where you are not automatically the
smartest and best at everything you do?

21:29.414 --> 21:32.042
Get over it.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.169
There are important things at stake.

21:34.253 --> 21:37.422
You've got my future planned out
for me as long as I stay here?

21:37.506 --> 21:40.384
- If you're good enough.
- Like what?

21:40.467 --> 21:43.637
Flying a transport plane
if I'm one of the lucky ones?

21:43.762 --> 21:47.349
I don't see this exciting future
you're talking about, Major.

21:47.432 --> 21:51.645
Something more incredible
than anything even you could imagine.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.524
Yes, ma'am.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.694
Cadet.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.448
Believe me.

22:21.008 --> 22:25.095
Science is about questioning
the status quo, questioning authority.

22:25.179 --> 22:29.308
How can we do that when the greatest
scientific discovery in human history...

22:29.391 --> 22:33.312
- ..is in the hands of the US Air Force?
- Oh, my God.

22:41.653 --> 22:43.614
The camera. Get the camera.

23:03.050 --> 23:05.093
Come on!

23:05.886 --> 23:08.263
- Colonel O'Neill.
- Go ahead.

23:08.347 --> 23:12.476
Wejust encountered one ofthe creatures.
We're following it into the forest.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.603
Let's go.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.321
Incredible.

23:41.088 --> 23:43.549
Hamilton, what are you doin'?

23:44.842 --> 23:47.928
You see, Colonel? They're harmless.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.651
(laughs)

24:14.204 --> 24:18.125
- Major, this is a high-security area.
- I know that, sir.

24:18.250 --> 24:22.087
But she's already checked out security
and signed the non-disclosure form.

24:22.171 --> 24:24.965
What did you tell her
she was going to see?

24:25.048 --> 24:27.593
Deep-space radar telemetry.

24:27.718 --> 24:32.598
- Are you absolutely sure about this?
- She is a perfect candidate for the SGC.

24:32.723 --> 24:35.017
Her file says otherwise.

24:35.142 --> 24:38.020
I've met her, sir. She is brilliant.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.442
Not everyone is cut out to be
an air-force officer, Major.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.445
Sir, if she can just get one glimpse...

24:46.528 --> 24:50.032
..of her possible future, she will
graduate at the top of her class...

24:50.157 --> 24:54.786
..and become an officer worthy
of serving under your command.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.750
I am absolutely sure about this, sir.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.968
We're underground.
Where could we possibly be going?

25:10.052 --> 25:14.932
You'll see. What you're about to see is
probably the best kept secret in the world.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.392
- You're making me nervous.
- Good.

25:17.518 --> 25:20.938
Because everything you thought
you knew about the universe...

25:21.021 --> 25:24.358
..is about to be turned upside down.
You ready?

25:43.919 --> 25:47.506
- What is it?
- It's your future.

25:47.589 --> 25:51.718
- It's called a Stargate.
- (technician) Chevron seven locked.

26:04.022 --> 26:07.109
You're looking at a wormhole
connecting this Stargate...

26:07.234 --> 26:11.947
..to another identical one on another
world 42,000 light years from Earth.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.741
- That's where we're going?
- That's right.

26:14.825 --> 26:17.703
- How?
- That's the easy part.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.830
Come on.

26:33.093 --> 26:35.137
What was that? What just happened?

26:35.220 --> 26:38.473
Your body was particlised
and then reintegrated.

26:38.599 --> 26:41.852
- So this is another planet?
- It's a moon, actually.

26:41.935 --> 26:44.229
Doesn't look that different from home.

26:44.313 --> 26:48.150
Well, where there's oxygen,
there's usually plant life, trees, water.

26:48.233 --> 26:51.028
There are a couple of differences.

26:57.493 --> 26:59.453
Hey, Carter.

27:00.496 --> 27:03.749
Thought I'd come and be
your welcoming committee.

27:03.832 --> 27:08.003
- Thank you, sir. How are you?
- The back's acting up a little, actually.

27:08.086 --> 27:12.633
- The knees, you know, always...
- Sir, I'd like you to meet Cadet Hailey.

27:13.967 --> 27:16.011
Cadet. Welcome to 862.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.848
How was your trip?

27:19.973 --> 27:23.894
It was a... a trip, sir.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.774
It always is.

27:28.857 --> 27:31.318
I got something you should see.

27:48.168 --> 27:51.004
- What is it?
- We're not sure,...

27:51.088 --> 27:55.008
..but we think it's some kind
of energy-based life form.

27:55.133 --> 27:58.720
- That's impossible.
- But one led us directly to the others,...

27:58.846 --> 28:02.182
..which suggests organisation,
some kind of intelligence.

28:02.266 --> 28:05.435
They also appear to be able
to phase through solid matter.

28:05.561 --> 28:08.564
Teal'c and I saw one
zip right on through a tree.

28:08.689 --> 28:11.650
- Didn't even slow it down.
- That's so cool.

28:11.733 --> 28:14.695
That's exactly what I said. I said that.

28:15.153 --> 28:18.157
If that's the case,
what's keeping it inside this cylinder?

28:18.240 --> 28:21.577
That was Dr Lee's idea.
The top and bottom plates are electrified.

28:21.702 --> 28:24.079
The field seems to be holding it in.

28:25.372 --> 28:27.833
You're not hurting it, are you?

28:27.958 --> 28:32.671
The creature has no physical body.
I don't think it's capable of feeling pain.

28:32.754 --> 28:36.758
But if it's intelligent, it might not
appreciate being held in a cage.

28:36.842 --> 28:38.969
Might be time to let this one go, Doc.

28:39.094 --> 28:41.638
Colonel, no, please. We need to study it.

28:41.722 --> 28:44.183
Find another way.

28:59.740 --> 29:03.494
Bill, come in. Any sign ofthe swarm?

29:03.577 --> 29:05.954
Nothin'. Looks like they just disappeared.

29:14.505 --> 29:20.511
They gotta be around here somewhere.
Try checking for high-frequency spikes.

29:20.594 --> 29:22.638
You got it.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.609
Hey there.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.903
Where are your friends?

29:37.986 --> 29:39.947
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:40.072 --> 29:43.492
Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you.

29:45.285 --> 29:49.206
Bill, you gettin' anything
on the high frequency? Bill?

30:01.927 --> 30:03.971
- Bill, come in.
- (screaming)

30:14.106 --> 30:17.109
- Oh, God! Colonel...
- (zapping)

30:47.764 --> 30:49.975
Teal'c?

30:50.100 --> 30:52.561
Do you mind if I call you Teal'c?

30:53.812 --> 30:56.481
I have no other name.

30:56.565 --> 31:00.068
So I'm guessing you're not...

31:00.152 --> 31:02.446
Human.

31:02.571 --> 31:07.701
- Then your guess is correct.
- Then is this your planet? I mean moon.

31:07.784 --> 31:11.205
It is not. My home world is called Chulak.

31:11.330 --> 31:15.375
Your world? Wait a second.
How many places does the Stargate go?

31:15.459 --> 31:19.379
The Stargate network is
composed of a great many worlds.

31:19.505 --> 31:23.425
- Are you serious?
- Colonel O'Neill! Colonel O'Neill!

31:23.550 --> 31:26.470
Colonel O'Neill! Help, Colonel O'Neill!

31:28.222 --> 31:30.974
- What?
- It's Dr Thompson.

31:31.058 --> 31:34.061
- Those things, they're attacking him.
- Where?

31:34.186 --> 31:36.647
In the clearing where
we first encountered them.

31:36.772 --> 31:39.858
Carter, get him inside. Teal'c, with me.

31:41.652 --> 31:42.819
Go, go, go.

32:19.565 --> 32:23.318
Hey! Just what about my radio
transmission did you not understand?

32:23.402 --> 32:25.445
- Let's go!
- Just finishing up, sir.

32:25.571 --> 32:29.491
- What happened to Dr Thompson?
- He's dead. Let's move.

32:31.910 --> 32:35.956
Colonel, we don't know what happened.
This might be an isolated incident.

32:36.039 --> 32:40.085
- The creatures may have been provoked.
- Maybe. Let me ask you this.

32:40.169 --> 32:42.212
- Why take a chance?
- O'Neill.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.381
(high-pitched buzzing)

32:50.095 --> 32:52.556
All right, back inside.

33:05.569 --> 33:09.156
- These walls will not protect us, O'Neill.
- We got about 15 seconds.

33:09.239 --> 33:12.743
- I don't know, sir. Zats, maybe.
- Maybe?

33:12.826 --> 33:15.787
I just got here.
Zats deliver an electrical charge.

33:15.871 --> 33:19.458
They're the only weapon I can think of
that might have an effect.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.044
All right, everybody get down.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.981
We've wired up the aluminum walls.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.400
When we switch on the current
it might keep them out,...

34:27.525 --> 34:32.322
..the same way that Dr Lee's
containment vessel kept them in.

34:37.953 --> 34:40.581
- They are returning.
- Light it up.

34:43.125 --> 34:45.502
Stand clear of the walls.

34:48.005 --> 34:50.382
(small crashing sounds)

34:57.014 --> 35:00.434
- It's working.
- As long as we've got power, we're safe.

35:00.559 --> 35:03.103
How long do you think
the generator'll keep running?

35:03.228 --> 35:05.355
I'm not... I'm not sure.

35:08.442 --> 35:10.736
You're not sure?

35:10.819 --> 35:13.697
- Who refuelled it last?
- Dr Thompson.

35:14.865 --> 35:19.411
- I'm sure he filled it this morning.
- We don't know that.

35:19.495 --> 35:22.247
That would give us
another eight or so hours.

35:22.331 --> 35:25.000
- But you cannot be certain.
- No.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.294
All right, where is it?

35:27.377 --> 35:30.130
On the other side of the compound,
down by the creek.

35:30.214 --> 35:33.300
Basically, it could run out at any time.

35:40.766 --> 35:45.062
- Carter?
- I think I may have a way out of here, sir.

35:45.187 --> 35:49.650
The creatures are being held back by
the electrical field around the building.

35:49.733 --> 35:54.613
We need to create a field big enough
to repel them from the entire area.

35:54.696 --> 35:57.241
- Yeah?
- The Stargate, sir.

35:57.324 --> 36:01.787
It's a giant superconductor. The field
it generates would be more than enough.

36:01.870 --> 36:03.997
So somebody's gotta go and dial out.

36:04.081 --> 36:06.875
Anyone attempting to reach it
will be killed.

36:06.959 --> 36:11.338
(Carter) Not necessarily. The human body
has an electrical field of its own.

36:11.463 --> 36:16.009
Do you remember what happened when
Dr Hamilton was hit by Teal'c's zat fire?

36:16.134 --> 36:21.807
The creatures must have left his body,
because his electrical field was altered.

36:21.890 --> 36:24.768
- How long will it last?
- I don't know, sir.

36:25.394 --> 36:29.565
- Shoot him again.
- A second shot from a zat'n'ktel kills.

36:34.111 --> 36:39.867
It's just a guess. I'm not sure you'd make
it to the gate before you were vulnerable.

36:39.950 --> 36:42.786
Hey, why'd they attack in the first place?

36:42.870 --> 36:46.290
It's possible they were reacting
to the capture of one of their own.

36:46.373 --> 36:49.543
- That's not it.
- What?

36:49.668 --> 36:52.754
I've gone over Dr Thompson's
astronomical observations.

36:52.880 --> 36:57.176
Did you know this moon wasn't formed
from the accretion disc of the planet?

36:57.259 --> 36:59.303
No. But I suspected.

37:01.889 --> 37:06.768
Dr Thompson thinks it was a rogue that
got pulled into an eccentric polar orbit.

37:06.894 --> 37:11.190
A planet's magnetic field emanates from
the poles. It's where it's the most intense.

37:11.273 --> 37:15.569
We entered into the polar phase
of the orbit a couple of days ago,...

37:15.652 --> 37:18.113
..at the time the creatures
were encountered.

37:18.197 --> 37:22.659
They became violent right at the moment
we were directly over the pole.

37:22.784 --> 37:25.245
It's possible, sir.

37:25.329 --> 37:29.541
- Go on.
- We're beyond the point of peak intensity.

37:29.625 --> 37:32.878
If we wait, the creatures will go back
to the way they were before.

37:33.003 --> 37:36.757
- How long would that take?
- A couple of hours. No more than that.

37:36.882 --> 37:39.676
The generator will most likely
not last that long.

37:39.760 --> 37:43.096
We'll hold them off
with those phaser things.

37:45.224 --> 37:48.644
- What do you think?
- Well, sir, if I'm right...

37:48.769 --> 37:53.899
..and their behaviour is retaliatory,
waiting will just make things worse.

37:53.982 --> 37:57.986
- You're not right. I am.
- You don't know that, Cadet.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.447
The creatures are affected
by electric fields.

38:00.572 --> 38:04.159
You think it's a coincidence that
they go berserk as we pass over the pole?

38:04.284 --> 38:09.498
Is it a coincidence that they attacked us
after one of their own was captured?

38:13.752 --> 38:18.298
Sir, we can't both be right.
The theories are mutually exclusive.

38:18.382 --> 38:22.052
There's evidence to support both,
but not enough to reach a conclusion.

38:22.261 --> 38:25.180
Don't dismiss my idea
because you expect her to be right.

38:25.264 --> 38:27.808
It doesn't matter who's right, Cadet.

38:29.101 --> 38:32.855
Colonel,
you're risking your life for nothing.

38:34.022 --> 38:36.316
Decision's made.

38:37.234 --> 38:39.945
How could it not matter who's right?

38:40.988 --> 38:44.408
If he makes a run for the gate,
he's risking his own life.

38:44.491 --> 38:47.202
If he waits, he risks everyone's life.

38:47.286 --> 38:49.329
He can't do that.

38:57.421 --> 39:00.257
As soon as I get the gate open,
head straight for it.

39:00.340 --> 39:04.094
- Don't bring anything with you.
- We can't just leave weeks of research.

39:04.219 --> 39:08.515
Carter, if he so much as brings
a file folder, shoot him.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.684
Yes, sir.

39:12.853 --> 39:15.856
- Are you ready, O'Neill?
- No.

39:15.981 --> 39:18.692
Give me a warning.

39:18.775 --> 39:21.778
I'm going to shoot you.

39:21.862 --> 39:25.365
I was thinking more
along the lines of "On three..."

39:26.283 --> 39:28.327
One...

39:32.623 --> 39:34.833
Two!

39:34.958 --> 39:37.169
God! I said "On three"!

39:39.588 --> 39:41.632
God!

39:43.091 --> 39:46.053
- Good luck, O'Neill.
- Wish me luck.

39:46.136 --> 39:48.180
Good luck, sir.

39:49.139 --> 39:51.183
Thank you.

39:52.601 --> 39:55.270
Go!

40:58.333 --> 41:01.003
I'm at the gate. I'm gonna start dialling.

41:31.825 --> 41:34.286
(Carter) Colonel? Colonel!

41:39.958 --> 41:42.002
Quickly, O'Neill.

42:01.230 --> 42:04.983
I'll never complain
about mosquitoes again.

42:21.875 --> 42:24.545
We owe you our thanks, Colonel.

42:24.628 --> 42:26.672
I suppose.

42:27.881 --> 42:31.218
And I owe you... an apology.

42:33.011 --> 42:35.472
I suppose you do.

42:39.309 --> 42:43.313
- Is it always like this?
- No. Sometimes it gets really exciting.

42:43.397 --> 42:46.024
Will I ever find out
which one of us was right?

42:46.108 --> 42:50.404
If you stick around long enough, maybe.
Besides, there'll always be other planets.

42:50.529 --> 42:54.283
- It's a moon.
- OK. You're right about that.
