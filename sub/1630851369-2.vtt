Those are gang colors.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.398
- What are you, a cop?

00:07.442 --> 00:09.705
- I used to be.
But now I'm a doc.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.141
<i>- Doctor Hammer.</i>

00:11.185 --> 00:12.316
- What brought you back
to Chicago?

00:12.360 --> 00:13.404
- Home, sweet home.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.450
- What made you stay?
- Same.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.017
- And what's up
with you and her?

00:18.627 --> 00:20.846
- Let's go.
- All right, let's get her CT.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.065
- Dr. Cooper?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.284
What happened
with your patient?

00:23.327 --> 00:26.156
Is this due to
the cardiac output monitor?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.636
- I want to come back to Med.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.639
- Dr. Cooper is our biggest
booster of the Vas-COM,

00:30.682 --> 00:34.208
and I suspect it's because
he's getting kickbacks.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.861
- You're saying you want me
to be your spy?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.689
- Are you in...

00:37.733 --> 00:39.039
or out?

00:41.389 --> 00:44.566
- Dr. Halstead.
Thank you.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.698
Glad to catch you
on your way in.

00:46.742 --> 00:49.788
I did some digging
on the Open Payments website.

00:49.832 --> 00:54.402
Turns out, Dr. Cooper
has gotten some very fat perks

00:54.445 --> 00:57.231
since he started boosting
the Vas-COM.

00:57.274 --> 01:00.060
He has also received
more than a few

01:00.103 --> 01:02.845
"consulting fees"
from Vasik Labs

01:02.888 --> 01:04.368
and other companies.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.283
- And you think
they're hidden bribes

01:06.327 --> 01:08.068
for promoting the device.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.765
- Yeah, illegal kickbacks.

01:09.808 --> 01:13.073
We have to establish
that they are bribes

01:13.116 --> 01:14.857
tied to the sale of the device.

01:14.900 --> 01:19.296
Look, I can't report
Dr. Cooper, ruin his career,

01:19.340 --> 01:22.212
unless I know for sure.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.127
- I could stop
by the ICU today,

01:24.171 --> 01:26.390
see what the Critical Care docs
are saying about the Vas-COM

01:26.434 --> 01:29.219
and why they're using it
so frequently.

01:29.263 --> 01:33.049
- See if it's Cooper's doing.
I like that.

01:33.093 --> 01:37.445
Uh, Dr. Halstead.
Be careful.

- Morning, Dr. Taylor.

01:49.587 --> 01:50.893
- I, um--

01:50.936 --> 01:53.156
I found this in my locker.
Was it you?

01:53.200 --> 01:57.117
- Yeah, I didn't mean to--
- No...thank you.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.295
- Happy birthday.
And don't worry.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.600
No one else knows.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.559
- Good, 'cause I don't like
to make a fuss.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.038
- And of all the days
to come in early.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.388
What are you doing here,
anyway?

02:07.431 --> 02:09.520
You shift doesn't start
for another two hours!

02:09.564 --> 02:11.174
- Decided to start
rounding early.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.872
I want to stay two steps
ahead of my competition.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.439
No, actually,
I want to crush them...

02:15.483 --> 02:16.658
- [chuckles]
- And win some brownie points

02:16.701 --> 02:18.964
with Dr. Archer.
- Atta girl.

02:19.008 --> 02:22.359
Oh, and I know that you
probably have other plans,

02:22.403 --> 02:25.362
but if you don't,
can I take you out for a drink?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.104
- Okay, I might be down
for a drink.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.497
[laughs softly]
I'll let you know.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.499
- Okay.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.284
- And that's when I realized
that standing out

02:34.328 --> 02:36.330
was way better
than trying to fit in.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.201
So next time
them little girls

- Don't hate me
'cause you ain't me.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.646

[chuckles]

02:48.690 --> 02:50.779

- Hey, it's my pleasure.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.650

please.

Oh, my God, are you a doctor?
Please help me, please help me.

I don't want to die, please.
- It's okay, it's all right.

What happened?
- Said she took some pills.

03:00.615 --> 03:03.313
Sleeping pills, I think.
Her name is Krista Valdez.

- All right, calm down.

- It's all right.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.230
Just slow your breathing.
- Okay.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.536
- Okay?

03:08.579 --> 03:09.885
So you say you took
some sleeping pills.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.495
You gotta tell me how many
and how long ago.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.236
- Uh, I don't know.
12, maybe 14,

03:13.280 --> 03:14.498
about ten minutes ago.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.586
- Grab the activated charcoal.

- All right. Okay, Krista,

03:29.818 --> 03:31.820
I need you to drink that down
slow and steady, all right?

it down your nose,

03:53.929 --> 03:55.757

give you the charcoal that way.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.498

Am I gonna die?

Okay? I swear.

- Hey, Trish.
Orders for L3.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.040
I was wondering,
is it me,

04:18.083 --> 04:20.085
or does it seem like we've
been seeing the Vas-COM

04:20.129 --> 04:21.957
used a lot more frequently
as of late?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.132
- Oh, yeah.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.481
Dr. Cooper can't stop
talking about it.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.875
- Really?
What's he, uh, saying?

04:26.918 --> 04:27.963
[curtain rattles]
- Heard my name.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.747
You looking for me?
- Matt, hey.

04:29.791 --> 04:33.838
Yeah, actually.
Was, uh,

04:33.882 --> 04:36.363
curious to learn more
of the benefits

04:36.406 --> 04:37.625
with the Vas-COM device.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.191
- It's a pretty remarkable
product, really.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.063
In fact, since we've
started using it,

04:41.106 --> 04:43.631
we've seen an 8% reduction
in mortality.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.197
- Phew.
8%?

04:45.241 --> 04:48.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's impressive.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.942
But, uh, how exactly
do you draw

04:50.986 --> 04:52.727
a correlation to the device?

04:52.770 --> 04:54.163
- Oh, it's pretty simple math,
really.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.165
So when you're monitoring flow,
your patient is,

04:56.208 --> 04:58.123
more often than not,
in the correct fluid balance,

04:58.167 --> 05:00.256
and so that alone
has dramatically reduced

05:00.300 --> 05:02.171
ICU acute kidney injury rates,

05:02.214 --> 05:05.261
which we know is directly
correlated to prognosis.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.871
It's not a perfect science.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.743
But the Vas-COM's the
only new variable

05:08.786 --> 05:10.310
we've introduced, so...

05:10.353 --> 05:12.834
- Pretty straight line.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.662
And the other devices
on the market

05:14.705 --> 05:17.317
can't even hold a candle.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.796
Vas-COM is a bit more pricey.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.102
- Oh, yeah?
- Sure, of course.

05:20.145 --> 05:23.018
But, I mean, cost/benefit,
am I right?

05:23.061 --> 05:25.194
Oh, listen.
Sorry, I gotta run.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.109

- Hey, Nancy,

05:32.854 --> 05:35.291

- Okay.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.684
Oh! Dr. Marcel.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.207

05:38.250 --> 05:40.078

to touch base with you

05:40.122 --> 05:42.559
about a new program
the hospital is setting up.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.909
- Uh-huh.
- Totally voluntary,

05:44.953 --> 05:48.217
but attendings can sign up
as advisors to residents.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.610
- Advisors?

05:49.653 --> 05:52.003
- You know, meet regularly,
offer counsel

05:52.047 --> 05:53.875
if they have any questions
or concerns.

05:53.918 --> 05:57.052
Just, you know, see them
through their residency.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.576

05:59.620 --> 06:01.622
That sounds like
a great program.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.014
I just, uh--you know,

06:03.058 --> 06:04.973
I wouldn't want to leave
anyone hanging, you know?

06:05.016 --> 06:09.499
- Leave anyone hanging how?
You planning on leaving Med?

06:09.543 --> 06:12.197
- No, no.
Nothing like that.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.809
Just, uh, like to keep
my dance card open, is all.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.377

- But, hey,

06:17.420 --> 06:19.030
let me think about it.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.472
Thank you.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.738
- Um, uh, just
a little light-headed.

- Come on, let's sit down.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.180

this gadget, let's--

06:39.964 --> 06:42.097
- Oh, blood sugar's a bit high.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.229
- Yeah, it's been like that
all week.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.842
Maybe I'll stop
by Endocrinology,

06:47.885 --> 06:50.322
see if Dr. Yang
can squeeze me in.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.194
- Okay, just as a precaution.
You know?

06:52.237 --> 06:54.065
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, you gonna be okay?

Hey.
- I didn't get far.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.988
Cooper caught me off-guard.
Gave me his hard sales pitch.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.555
I gotta say, this guy's good.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.339
- So if he's ever confronted,

07:07.383 --> 07:11.213
he can defend everything
he's doing as legit.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.650
Do you think
he suspected anything?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.392
- No, but if he is
who you say he is,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.089
confession's gonna be tough.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.091

07:27.403 --> 07:29.710
- More the merrier, I guess.
- After you.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.146
- What do we got?

07:31.189 --> 07:33.409
- 17 year-old male,
passed out at a skate park.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.369
BP 100/20, heart rate 70.
Blood sugar was 200.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.850
Gave a liter of normal saline
in the ambo.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.809
- What's your name?
- Brandon.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.637
- Brandon, I'm Dr. Hammer.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.421
- I'm Dr. Halstead.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.988
You got a history of diabetes?

07:47.031 --> 07:48.729
- No, uh, no, I don't.

07:48.772 --> 07:49.991
Did someone call my mom?

07:50.034 --> 07:51.688
- Oh, cops called her.
She's en route.

07:51.732 --> 07:52.820
- Brandon, you feel
stable enough

07:52.863 --> 07:54.212
to switch beds yourself?

07:54.256 --> 07:55.736
- Uh yeah, yeah I'm fine.
- Brandon?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.520
Oh, my God.
Are you okay, honey?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.000
- I'm fine, Mom, really.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.741
- What were you doing
at the skate park?

08:00.784 --> 08:02.525
You were supposed
to be studying.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.787
- I know.
- It is not good

08:03.831 --> 08:06.921
to exert yourself like that.
The stress.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.663
He has Addison's disease.
Was this another crisis?

08:09.706 --> 08:11.012
- No, it's his blood sugar.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.318
But is he on steroids
as a part of his regimen?

08:13.362 --> 08:14.450
- Yes, Prednisone.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.973
- Prednisone can cause
high blood sugar

08:16.017 --> 08:17.279
if he's getting too much.
- He's not.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.499
I manage
all of Brandon's medications.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.109
I take care of everything.

08:21.152 --> 08:24.112
What he eats, steps per day.
We're very careful.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.635
Are you sure you're all right?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.550
- Yes, Mom, I'm fine.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.379
- Well, if we're sure
medication isn't the cause,

08:30.422 --> 08:32.337
let's get an A1c test.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.948
That'll give us an idea
of his blood sugar levels

08:33.991 --> 08:35.863
over a period of time.
- It'll help us determine

08:35.906 --> 08:37.995
whether his body's
making insulin.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.041
There's a chance that he
could have developed diabetes.

08:40.084 --> 08:43.174
- Oh, God.
No.

08:43.218 --> 08:46.308
Brandon's supposed to be part
of an Addison clinical trial

08:46.351 --> 08:47.831
for a subcutaneous
medication device.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.224
- Mom, please.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.182
Diabetes is
an exclusionary factor.

08:51.226 --> 08:54.751
- It's okay, Mom.
There's gonna be other trials.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.231
- Let's not jump the gun
just yet.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.407
There may be
another explanation.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.627
- We'll circle back around
as soon as we have something.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.193
We're gonna figure this out.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.546
- So, Krista,
Dr. Scott's telling me

09:06.589 --> 09:09.113
that this is the first time
that you find yourself

09:09.157 --> 09:10.898
in a situation like this.
Is that right?

09:10.941 --> 09:12.595
- Oh, my God.
Yes.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.511
It was such a stupid mistake.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.600
I had been drinking,
so I wasn't in my right mind,

09:17.644 --> 09:20.081
and as soon as I took
the pills, I regretted it.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.736
- When you say that you
weren't in your right mind,

09:22.779 --> 09:24.868
what do you mean by that,
exactly?

09:24.912 --> 09:26.914
- Um...

09:26.957 --> 09:29.090
I got into an argument
with my mom,

09:29.133 --> 09:33.094
and I just sort of... lost it.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.399
I don't even know why I
called her in the first place.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.097
We don't even have
a relationship, so...

09:36.140 --> 09:38.534
- I'm sorry to hear that.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.147
- Yeah, I totally overreacted.
[laughs]

09:43.191 --> 09:45.149
So how much longer
do I need to be here?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.847
I just--I have a work trip
next week.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.109
I'm headed to the Congo,

09:48.152 --> 09:50.024
and I just have so much
to take care of.

09:50.067 --> 09:54.071
- The Congo, wow.
What kind of work do you do?

09:54.115 --> 09:57.074
- I work for UNICEF.
I'm a human rights attorney.

09:57.118 --> 10:00.512
I act as a negotiator,
helping to free child soldiers.

10:00.556 --> 10:03.733
- Wow. That's impressive.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.257
- You know what?
That is truly admirable.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.345
Really.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.478
I imagine, pretty stressful,
too.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.872
- No, I have it--
I have it really easy.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.876
These kids, the things
that they're forced to see,

10:15.919 --> 10:17.617
forced to do--

10:17.660 --> 10:19.662
Some of them are as young
as five years old.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.098
Trust me, we all live

10:21.142 --> 10:23.187
really charmed lives
in comparison.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.801
Just--listen, I would
really like to be discharged

10:27.844 --> 10:30.325
as soon as possible, so...

10:30.368 --> 10:32.066
do you have any more tests
to run or--

10:32.109 --> 10:33.371
how much longer do I
need to be here?

10:33.415 --> 10:35.852
- I want to give you
another liter of fluid,

10:35.896 --> 10:37.506
you know,
make sure you're hydrated.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.942
We'll talk after that.

10:38.986 --> 10:43.773
- You should rest a bit,
and uh, we'll be back.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.079
Nice to meet you, Krista.

10:45.122 --> 10:48.082

10:50.911 --> 10:53.870
- Oof.
Child soldiers?

10:53.914 --> 10:55.132
She's seen
some horrible things.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.699
- Oh, yeah.
No doubt.

10:56.743 --> 11:00.181
I mean, I think we're looking
at a mix of PTSD,

11:00.224 --> 11:02.923
chronic depression,
just general burnout, you know?

11:02.966 --> 11:05.708
- Yeah, she seems
genuinely regretful, though.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.188
You think this is
the wakeup call she needed?

11:07.231 --> 11:08.406
Ending up in the hospital
like this?

11:08.450 --> 11:09.712
- I think she wants
to believe that.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.018
I'm not remotely sold.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.237
Without--without an outlet,

11:13.281 --> 11:16.284
she's very likely
to self-harm again.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.373
- We can't just let her
walk out of here then.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.070
- You know, hopefully
Krista will admit herself

11:20.114 --> 11:21.245
to in-patient psych,

11:21.289 --> 11:23.378
but we gotta get her there.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.554
- A bag of saline
will buy us an hour.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.382
- [sighs]

11:30.864 --> 11:32.474
- Stevie.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.302
- Brandon's A1c results?
- Yep.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.652
Blood sugar's been normal.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.828
- So no diabetes.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.265
I guess he could be
hyperthyroid?

11:41.309 --> 11:42.527
- Yeah, I thought about that,

11:42.571 --> 11:44.051
but all of his thyroid labs
are normal.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.532
- What about pancreatitis?
- He's got no pain.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.404
His amylase and lipase
are normal too.

11:49.447 --> 11:52.233
I think the obvious answer
is right in front of us.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.843
- You mean his medicine.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.627
- Yeah.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.587
- You think this is
Munchausen's by proxy.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.110
- Maybe she's giving him
a little extra

12:00.154 --> 12:01.633
to keep him sick.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.114
- I don't know.
Feels like a reach.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.203
- Is it?
You said so yourself.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.335
She's incredibly involved.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.250
A bit too involved,
don't you think?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.034
I mean, 17's a little old

12:11.078 --> 12:13.297
for Mom to be doling out
your pills, no?

12:13.341 --> 12:14.908
- Teens aren't exactly
the most reliable

12:14.951 --> 12:16.083
when it comes
to taking their meds.

12:16.126 --> 12:19.086
- Yeah, but Marie
does fit the profile.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.740
Hovering, overly concerned--

12:20.783 --> 12:23.090
- She cares about her kid!

12:23.133 --> 12:25.309
- Look, if you have
another explanation...

12:26.920 --> 12:28.399
We owe it to Brandon
to get to the bottom of this.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.184
Without a competing theory,

12:30.227 --> 12:32.142
we at least have to explore
the possibility.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.974
[PA alert]

12:38.018 --> 12:39.846
- Dr. Archer, Dr. Marcel.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.456
MVC with a motorcycle incoming.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.937
- We're out of beds.
- Hybrid OR.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.026
- [sighs]
Taylor, with me.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.157
- Second victim's
right behind us.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.464
- I got this.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.771
- Sean Ritner,
a 26 year-old male,

12:51.814 --> 12:54.077
motorcycle creamed
by a car at the intersection.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.557
Intubated in the field.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.690
- GCS 3
- T, BP 190/60,
heart rate 130.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.954
Significant blood loss
in the field.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.565
Placed a tourniquet and put him
in a cardboard splint,

13:03.608 --> 13:05.306
but his limb's pretty mangled,
and he's shocky.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.351
- Trigger MTP.
On my count.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.005
- We're going to Hybrid OR.
What have we got?

13:09.049 --> 13:10.572
- Oh, my God.
- 38 year-old female.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.008
Unrestrained driver.
Struck a motorcycle

13:12.052 --> 13:12.966
while crossing
the intersection.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.532
Couple scrapes and bruises,

13:14.576 --> 13:16.099
but no focal complaints other
than some minor back pain.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.884
- I didn't see him!
I tried to swerve,

13:17.927 --> 13:19.059
but he came out of nowhere.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.147
- Okay, don't worry.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.148
We're gonna take
good care of you.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.585

in here.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.065
Nice and easy.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.154
Here we go.
Line it up right here.

13:27.197 --> 13:30.635
There it is.

- Okay.
- Deep breaths.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.600
There you go.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.822
Okay, clear breath sounds
bilaterally.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.346
- Is he gonna be all right?
He's not moving.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.956
- Dr. Archer's gonna take
good care of him.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.479
Let's just focus on you, okay?

13:48.523 --> 13:51.265
- I suffer from anxiety.
I--I need my medication.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.309
- Okay, we're gonna get you
a little something

13:52.353 --> 13:53.528
to help you relax.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.356
Half a milligram of Ativan,
please.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.097
You feeling any pain
anywhere?

13:57.140 --> 13:59.360
Okay.
Chest x-ray, stat.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.884
Look at me.
What's your name?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.538
- Mya.
- Mya, okay.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.105
My name is Dr. Marcel.
I'm gonna take care of you,

14:05.148 --> 14:06.584
okay?
- Okay.

14:09.674 --> 14:12.590
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

14:21.034 --> 14:22.513
- All right, pelvis looks good.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.993
I gotta check his arm.

14:25.952 --> 14:30.521
No active bleeding,
and I don't feel a pulse.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.654
I'll need a CT angiogram
to confirm,

14:32.697 --> 14:34.961
but I'm guessing he needs
a completion amputation.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.572
- Amputation?

14:37.615 --> 14:38.747
- Yeah, that's what I said.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.054
Unless you have
a better idea.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.578
- If the brachial artery
is out, which I suspect it is,

14:43.621 --> 14:45.797
can't we try
to revascularize the arm

14:45.841 --> 14:47.538
with a reverse
saphenous vein graft?

14:47.582 --> 14:50.324
- All right, we do that
and the repair goes down,

14:50.367 --> 14:51.629
then what happens?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.327
The arm dies,
now he's septic,

14:53.370 --> 14:54.676
now he might die.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.112
- Right. Forget it.
Dumb idea.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.462
- No, not a dumb idea.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.029
Good decisions come
from experience,

15:00.073 --> 15:02.597
and experience comes
from bad decisions.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.688
Actually, you might want
to scrub in for this,

15:06.731 --> 15:07.950
if you've got
the stomach for it.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.779
- That'd be incredible.
Thank you, Dr. Archer.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.520
- All right.
I'll come grab you

15:12.563 --> 15:13.738
once the patient's prepped.

15:20.876 --> 15:23.183
- Thank God.
So it isn't diabetes.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.359
Then he can do the trial!

15:25.402 --> 15:27.709
But then...
what's going on?

15:27.752 --> 15:29.711
- Well, we haven't quite
figured that out yet.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.583
But the most obvious answer
is usually the right one,

15:32.627 --> 15:35.021
which brings us back
to Brandon's medication.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.979
- I already told you, though,
I manage his medication,

15:37.023 --> 15:38.894
so I know he's getting
the right dosage.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.635
- Are you giving him
any other supplements?

15:40.678 --> 15:43.638
- No, nothing.
Just his prescriptions.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.466
- All right, well,
we're gonna send over

15:45.509 --> 15:47.424
a social worker
to speak with you.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.643

picture of Brandon's regimen.

- Do you not believe me?
- No, it's not that.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.175
- It's just that we've ruled
out any other causes.

15:59.219 --> 16:02.135
- I cannot believe this!
You think I'm lying,

16:02.178 --> 16:04.572
that I'm one of those people

16:04.615 --> 16:07.053
that would deliberately
make their kid sick?

16:07.096 --> 16:11.144
I would never hurt my son!
- Mom?

16:11.187 --> 16:13.015
What's going on?

16:13.059 --> 16:15.931
They think I'm messing
with your medication,

16:15.975 --> 16:19.456
giving you too much.
- What? Okay, no.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.762
She's not.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.024
She would never do
something like that.

- Look, we're sorry
that we upset you.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.594
We should go.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.465
- We're only trying to help,
Brandon.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.553
Figure out what
caused the episode.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.642
- But you can't, can you?

16:31.686 --> 16:33.035
That's why you're blaming me,

helping other people is,

a real emotional cost there.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.543
- I've called every hospital
with a decent psych ward

27:12.587 --> 27:13.632
in a 50-mile radius.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.894
They're all full
to capacity.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.373
System's messed up.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.375
Medical interventions
are given precedence

27:18.419 --> 27:20.639
over psychiatric ones.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.292
- What about relatives?

27:22.336 --> 27:23.729
Is there a world
where we could release her

27:23.772 --> 27:25.208
under family care
for the night,

27:25.252 --> 27:26.601
bring her back in
for an appointment tomorrow?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.342
- Thought about that too,
but her dad's deceased,

27:28.385 --> 27:30.736
and she's estranged
from her mom, you know?

27:30.779 --> 27:33.652
She's pretty damn isolated.
It's just her and her work.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.610
- All right, fellas.

27:35.654 --> 27:39.092
You find another hospital
to transfer Ms. Valdez to?

27:39.135 --> 27:41.050
I need this room free now.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.748
- We're working on it,
we're not there yet, all right?

27:42.791 --> 27:44.793
Every psych ward
in the area is full.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.360
- All right,
well, you know what to do.

27:46.403 --> 27:48.928
All right, arrange for a
transfer to Bachmann Medical.

27:48.971 --> 27:51.757
- The state hospital?
- Whoa, Dean, Dean, Dean--

27:51.800 --> 27:54.237
Patient is extremely fragile.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.413
Bachmann is the wrong
environment, trust me.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.111
- The way they transfer
patients there,

27:58.154 --> 28:00.026
with police, in cuffs--like,

28:00.069 --> 28:02.506
the whole thing is humiliating,
traumatizing.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.291
They treat people like perps
for seeking help.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.075
- I get it, I get it.
I do, but--

28:06.119 --> 28:09.078
- Do you get it?
Do you?

28:09.122 --> 28:10.427
Because you've been
running this joint

28:10.471 --> 28:13.169
like a drive-through car wash
since I got here.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.998
We're supposed
to be helping people.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.826
What the hell are
we doing here any--

28:17.870 --> 28:25.007
<i>♪</i>

28:32.536 --> 28:34.408
Sorry.

28:34.451 --> 28:35.931
I should have kept my cool
back there.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.803
- Don't gotta apologize
to me.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.718
A crappy situation.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.329
- Just when you think you're
making in-roads, you know?

28:42.372 --> 28:45.114
Helping somebody.

28:45.158 --> 28:48.988
Run into red tape
or lack of resources.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.293
It's so damn frustrating.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.776
- You had a fair amount
of experience with bureaucracy

28:54.820 --> 28:56.517
at your old job.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.172
- Grew up in the same
community I was policing.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.914
South Side, hundreds.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.916
Too many times, I felt
like I had to betray

29:03.959 --> 29:05.613
the people I was
supposed to be protecting.

29:05.656 --> 29:09.704
- Hmm. Why you left?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.837
- Part of the reason.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.926
You're not trying
to shrink me?

29:13.969 --> 29:16.537
- No, not trying
to shrink you, man.

29:19.453 --> 29:21.803
- Some years ago,
my partner and I--

29:21.847 --> 29:23.370
we responded to a call.

29:25.198 --> 29:28.201
Stray bullet from a drive-by
hit a 14 year-old boy.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.118
Kid was bleeding out,
shot through the thigh.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.513
By some miracle,
I was able to hold pressure

29:36.557 --> 29:39.690
long enough on the wound
for the paramedics to respond.

29:39.734 --> 29:40.822
- He make it?

29:40.866 --> 29:43.085
- Yeah, he survived.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.309
It's from the slug
that hit him.

29:51.050 --> 29:55.010
Man, it was the most alive,
the most useful

29:55.054 --> 29:56.969
I felt on the force,
you know?

29:57.012 --> 29:59.885
It's what drew me to medicine.

29:59.928 --> 30:03.062
But days like today...

30:03.105 --> 30:04.498
- Don't I know it.

30:04.541 --> 30:07.980
I know it feels like
we failed her.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.199
But the reality is,
it's not safe

30:10.243 --> 30:11.897
for Krista to be alone
right now.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.075
Given where we are, I think

30:16.118 --> 30:18.077
I don't really have a choice.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.209
I gotta call the admitting room
at State.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.561
Now look, some good doctors
there.

30:24.605 --> 30:25.824
I know a couple of them.

30:25.867 --> 30:29.044
I'll call them up,
get her on their radar.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.741
You still got a couple
of buddies on the force?

30:30.785 --> 30:34.049
Maybe we can get them
to handle the transfer?

30:34.093 --> 30:37.574
- Yeah, yeah, I could do that.
- All right.

30:37.618 --> 30:41.143
What do you say we go, uh--
we go make her safe?

30:41.187 --> 30:43.754
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:43.798 --> 30:46.192
- [exhales heavily]

30:51.110 --> 30:52.502
- Crockett, can I talk
to you for a sec?

30:52.546 --> 30:53.764
- Sure.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.115
We gotta make it quick,
though, sorry.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.204
I'm due in the OR in a sec.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.815
- Yeah, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.862
You advised Dr. Taylor to push
back against Archer today

31:03.905 --> 31:06.386
after a treatment plan
had already been put in place.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.996
- Uh, no, not exactly.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.303
Dr. Taylor asked me
for my advice,

31:10.346 --> 31:12.000
and I told her--
- You told her

31:12.044 --> 31:13.654
to stick her neck out

31:13.697 --> 31:15.395
and make an enemy
of the chief of the ED.

31:15.438 --> 31:16.396
You think that
was sound advice?

31:16.439 --> 31:18.180
- Oh, hold on, Maggie.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.922
Dr. Taylor went to Archer
of her own accord.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.969
And I gotta say, I admire her
for advocating for her patient.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.667
Where's this coming from?

31:26.710 --> 31:29.365
- As a person in a position
of influence,

31:29.409 --> 31:30.323
I think you should be
more mindful

31:30.366 --> 31:31.541
of the things that you say.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.632
Your two cents--
it has consequences.

31:35.676 --> 31:36.851
Remember that.

31:45.686 --> 31:48.167
- Mrs. Davis?
Can I join you?

31:56.088 --> 31:59.047
- I swear I only want
what's best for Brandon.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.832
- I know it probably feels

32:01.876 --> 32:04.270
like everyone's judging you
right now, but...

32:04.313 --> 32:06.402
not me.

32:06.446 --> 32:07.969
I see how deeply
you love Brandon,

32:08.013 --> 32:10.058
and I admire that
more than you know.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.845
- Brandon suffered
his first crisis

32:14.889 --> 32:17.761
right after his father died.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.763
My husband was killed
in a head-on collision

32:19.807 --> 32:22.114
by a drunk driver.
- I'm so sorry.

32:25.030 --> 32:28.207
- A few weeks
after the funeral,

32:28.250 --> 32:31.514
Brandon started vomiting
out of nowhere.

32:33.299 --> 32:36.998
He could barely move.
He wasn't making any sense.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.521
We don't have
any family nearby,

32:38.565 --> 32:41.350
I didn't know who to call,
I had just lost my husband,

32:41.394 --> 32:43.004
and I was so scared that--

32:43.048 --> 32:44.788
- You were gonna lose
Brandon, too.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.706
I can see why you're
so determined to protect him.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.709
- It's just--

32:52.753 --> 32:56.496
the thought of him
being so far away.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.498
If anything were
to happen to him,

32:58.541 --> 32:59.542
and I wasn't there--

32:59.586 --> 33:01.501
- Mrs. Davis.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.503
I know that the prospect
of letting him go

33:03.546 --> 33:05.461
must be terrifying.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.899
But you've taken such good care
of Brandon all these years,

33:08.943 --> 33:10.553
I think that you can trust
that you've shown him

33:10.597 --> 33:12.033
how to take care of himself.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.820
- He really is a good kid.

33:20.389 --> 33:24.785
You must have kids of your own.
- No, no kids.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.658
But I was always
the little girl

33:28.702 --> 33:30.573
that wished that she had
a mom like you.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.191
[machines beeping]

33:39.234 --> 33:42.063
- Okay, repair's done.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.413
Removing the vascular clamp
from the artery.

33:44.457 --> 33:45.762
Hand me the Doppler.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.904
- Not hearing a signal.
Just static.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.951
There's no flow
to the wrist.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.215
All right, we're not sunk yet.

34:03.258 --> 34:04.912
If I can pull out the clot,
there's a chance

34:04.955 --> 34:07.610
we can still restore
blood flow.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.177
Let's open up the repair,

34:09.221 --> 34:11.832
stick down a balloon,
and thrombectomize.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.094
- Putting another quarter
in the machine.

34:16.271 --> 34:19.318
- Wait, what do you mean
you don't have a bed for me?

34:19.361 --> 34:21.537
- I am so sorry that
we can't accommodate you here.

34:21.581 --> 34:22.886
Really, I am.

34:22.930 --> 34:25.063
But we have found a bed
for you at Bachmann.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.501
- Bachmann?
No.

34:28.544 --> 34:29.850
No, no, no.
There's no way.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.982
That is for people
with really serious issues.

34:32.026 --> 34:33.288
That's...

34:33.332 --> 34:34.637
Oh, my God.
That's like lockdown.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.291
No, if I cannot stay here,

34:36.335 --> 34:38.424
then I would like
to go home now, please.

34:38.467 --> 34:41.122
- Krista, I'm really
very worried about you.

34:41.166 --> 34:44.125
So I'm afraid that discharge
is just not an option.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.692
You know, it's my opinion
that you are still

34:45.735 --> 34:48.129
a danger to yourself,
and I really think

34:48.173 --> 34:51.785
you need to be somewhere safe.
- I don't--I don't--

34:51.828 --> 34:53.308
You know what?
You made it seem

34:53.352 --> 34:54.788
like this was my choice.
- And you made the right choice

34:54.831 --> 34:57.443
- No, what you both did
was lie to me.

34:57.486 --> 34:58.966
You were always going
to commit me, weren't you?

34:59.009 --> 35:00.010
- Krista--
- You told me

35:00.054 --> 35:01.403
that I can stay here,

35:01.447 --> 35:02.709
and that we were gonna figure
this out together.

35:02.752 --> 35:03.797
You know what?
Screw you guys.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.972
I'm out of here.

35:05.015 --> 35:05.929
Get this out of me.
- Whoa, Krista--

35:05.973 --> 35:07.279
- No, do not touch me!

35:07.322 --> 35:08.628
- Hold still Krista,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

35:08.671 --> 35:09.629
- Let me go, please!
- Restraints!

35:09.672 --> 35:10.804
- No!
- Whoa, Krista--

35:10.847 --> 35:12.066
- Restraints, please?
- No, please!

35:12.110 --> 35:15.287
[sobbing] No, please!
No I don't want to!

35:15.330 --> 35:16.636
No!
- Calm down.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.159
No, please leave me alone.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.814
- Just let her help you!
- Leave me alone!

35:20.857 --> 35:23.295
Please leave me alone!
- Please, calm down.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.774
- Please.
[sobs]

35:27.821 --> 35:29.039
Liars!

35:33.043 --> 35:36.917
[laughing]

35:36.960 --> 35:38.745
- Going to London!

35:38.788 --> 35:40.660
- Good luck at school.
- Thank you!

35:41.965 --> 35:42.879
- Aw, man.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.711
Marie agreed to let
Brandon skip the trial.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.409
She said you spoke to her.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.804
Come on.
What, you're not gonna tell me?

35:57.503 --> 35:58.852
What'd you say?

35:58.895 --> 36:00.941
- There you go,
sticking your nose in again.

36:03.291 --> 36:07.687
Seriously, though, I'm sorry
that I was hard on you today.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.516
You know I can hit
below the belt sometimes.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.432
But it's always followed
by a healthy dose of guilt,

36:13.475 --> 36:15.303
if that's any consolation.
- Oh, it is.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.827
- [laughs]

36:17.871 --> 36:20.308
- Dr. Hammer? Your paycheck.
- Thank you.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.962
- Don't spend it all
at one place.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.659
- Yeah, right.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.053
Least I'll be able
to make rent this month.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.750
- Always was your thing.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.622
Always loved to cry broke.

36:29.665 --> 36:32.277
- Well, some of us didn't
get a full ride to med school.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.453
- Well, maybe if you spent
a little less time on your hair

36:34.496 --> 36:36.237
and a little more time
in the books...

36:36.281 --> 36:37.804
[giggles]

36:45.725 --> 36:47.379
- Hey!
How'd it go?

36:47.422 --> 36:49.250
- Hey!
We were able to get a pulse.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.512
- [exhales]

36:50.556 --> 36:51.513
- Looks like Sean's
gonna keep his arm.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.211
- Really?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.038
[laughing]

36:55.082 --> 36:56.083
- This is amazing.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.432
- Well, let's go share

36:57.476 --> 36:58.694
the good news
with the family, yeah?

37:00.392 --> 37:03.090
Um, listen.
I also need to apologize.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.787
You know, when I weighed in
this morning,

37:04.831 --> 37:08.008
I didn't mean to, you know,
throw you into the lion's den.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.706
Maggie said I--
- Wait, Maggie?

37:10.750 --> 37:12.969
- Yeah, she pointed out
that I may have

37:13.013 --> 37:15.058
put you in a bad spot
with Archer.

37:15.102 --> 37:16.582
Maybe I did, but I--
- No, please,

37:16.625 --> 37:17.713
if you hadn't said something,

37:17.757 --> 37:19.411
it would have
haunted me forever.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.589
I am so, so thankful
for your advice.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.939
- Okay.
- As a matter of fact,

37:25.982 --> 37:28.115
they're doing this program
with the residents.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.899
- Yeah, I heard of it.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.424
- Well, they haven't
paired me up with anyone yet.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.687
Any chance you'd want
to be my advisor?

37:35.731 --> 37:38.299
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

37:38.343 --> 37:39.866
- Great!

37:39.909 --> 37:41.215
- Come on.
- Okay.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.871
- I really appreciate
your making time

37:44.914 --> 37:46.394
to check me out,
Dr. Yang.

37:46.438 --> 37:47.743
- It's no problem.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.485
I'm actually glad
you checked in when you did.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.400
- I don't like
the sound of that.

37:52.444 --> 37:53.880
What's up?

37:53.923 --> 37:56.926
- Your labs show
your blood sugar

37:56.970 --> 37:59.842
has been climbing
over the last month or so.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.453
- Well, I haven't
changed anything.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.716
I'm still eating healthy,
exercising,

38:03.759 --> 38:06.153
adhering to my insulin regimen.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.937
- Well, as you know,
sometimes the disease

38:07.981 --> 38:10.462
can progress despite
a healthy lifestyle.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.813
But no need to worry.
We'll adjust your meds,

38:13.856 --> 38:16.816
add an oral that will reduce
your resistance to insulin.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.167
Also, stress
can definitely play a part.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.778
Are you dealing with anything
particularly taxing right now?

38:22.822 --> 38:25.564
[knock at door]
- Uh, come in?

38:25.607 --> 38:27.827
Just the usual work stuff.

38:29.045 --> 38:31.004
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, no.

38:31.047 --> 38:33.485
- I was just leaving.
I'll call in a prescription.

38:33.528 --> 38:34.834
- Thank you.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.753
- Everything okay?

38:40.796 --> 38:42.189
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.410
- Ms. Goodwin,
I think we've taken

38:45.453 --> 38:47.629
the wrong approach
with Matt Cooper,

38:47.673 --> 38:49.805
coming at him headlong,
hoping eventually

38:49.849 --> 38:51.329
he'll slip up, say something.

38:51.372 --> 38:52.852
- Okay?

38:52.895 --> 38:54.636
- If he's really on the take,

38:54.680 --> 38:56.377
the more devices
the hospital buys,

38:56.421 --> 38:58.727
the bigger his kickbacks,
right?

38:58.771 --> 39:01.034
So he's gonna want as many
departments as he can get

39:01.077 --> 39:03.819
to start using the thing.
- Right.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.995
And he needs docs
not to just use the device,

39:06.039 --> 39:09.564
but to shill for it.
Corruptible docs.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.307
So I make myself
the perfect target.

39:14.221 --> 39:15.483
- And how do you do that?

39:15.527 --> 39:17.746
- Cry broke.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.879
Make him think
I'd do anything for money.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.881
- Let Cooper hook you in.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.755
I knew you were
the right man for this job.

39:32.631 --> 39:35.285
- Okay, gotta go.

39:35.329 --> 39:36.896
- Dr. Taylor.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.247
Hey!

39:43.816 --> 39:48.690
Vanessa.
Vanessa.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.737
Are you leaving now?
What about the drink?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.260
- When I confided
in you earlier,

39:53.303 --> 39:54.348
I was silly enough to think

39:54.392 --> 39:55.915
that it was gonna stay
between us.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.657
But you continue to prove
you can't stay in your lane.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.485
- Vanessa, look.
I'm sorry--

40:00.528 --> 40:01.921
- No.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.792
I just want you to treat me
like everyone else.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.359
That's all I want.

40:09.885 --> 40:13.672
- Hey, Willie,
no cuffs, all right?

40:13.715 --> 40:16.152
I know it's protocol,
but do me a solid.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.806
- You got it.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.383
- [sighs]

40:30.471 --> 40:32.212
- How long you been doing this?

40:34.823 --> 40:37.391
- 35 years, I don't know.
Something like that.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.219
- How?

40:39.262 --> 40:42.091
- You gotta hang on to those--
those good days.

40:42.135 --> 40:44.267
You know, hang on to the wins.

40:44.311 --> 40:46.792
That's why you got that bullet
around your neck, right?

40:48.358 --> 40:49.795
There you go.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.667
Really important, buddy.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.756
I mean for me, anyway.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.674
Gotta hang on to those wins.
