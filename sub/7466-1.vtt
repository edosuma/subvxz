Not going to work.

53:01.900 --> 53:03.800
Sorry, Greg. I didn't see you there.

53:03.968 --> 53:05.026
[ALL LAUGH]

53:06.871 --> 53:10.432
GREG: Kevin, did you find your
present under there? It's a big box.

53:16.114 --> 53:18.310
- You're a lucky man, Wally.
- I am?

53:18.483 --> 53:21.316
Yeah. With your job at Tyler Toys,
I'm sure you get free samples.

53:21.486 --> 53:23.250
That's got to come in handy
at Christmastime.

53:23.421 --> 53:26.914
Oh, yeah. Heh. Yeah,
that's just the way I look at it too.

53:27.092 --> 53:31.928
I'm lucky. Lucky me.
What kind of luck?

53:32.097 --> 53:35.499
Well, I've gotta hand it to you, Bobby.
You sure seem confident.

53:35.667 --> 53:37.897
Me? Why? About what?

53:38.069 --> 53:41.972
It's almost time for final exams and
you didn't bring home one single book.

53:42.140 --> 53:45.474
- Oh, that. Well...
- Excuse me, Bobby,

53:45.643 --> 53:47.975
- but I've been waiting to see you.
- Oh, great.

53:48.146 --> 53:49.739
I mean, I'm ready to be seen.

53:49.914 --> 53:51.279
Anytime. What do you need?

53:51.449 --> 53:54.419
Well, when you get your degree
in business administration,

53:54.586 --> 53:57.078
can you help me out
with some financial advice?

53:57.255 --> 54:00.953
- Uh, I'd love to, Alice, but...
- But what?

54:02.327 --> 54:06.696
Any firm I go to work for would
probably want me to charge too much.

54:06.865 --> 54:09.630
I remember when Sam gave me
that first job at the butcher shop.

54:09.801 --> 54:11.792
[CRIES]

54:14.372 --> 54:18.570
What did you have to go
and say Sam for?

54:18.743 --> 54:20.233
[SOBBING]

54:22.247 --> 54:23.578
I blew it, Mom.

54:29.888 --> 54:31.686
Kids are so cute when they're asleep.

54:31.856 --> 54:33.187
[LAUGHS]

54:33.725 --> 54:37.025
Speaking of kids,
have you two any ideas?

54:39.197 --> 54:40.995
What did I say?

54:41.933 --> 54:44.402
Just talking about marital bliss.

54:49.374 --> 54:52.207
You know, I can't believe
I'm finally getting to meet all of you.

54:52.377 --> 54:55.870
Let's see if I make any mistakes.
Greg and Bobby.

54:56.047 --> 54:58.812
Marcia and Jan.

54:58.983 --> 55:01.111
- Dopey. Happy-
- And Bashful.

55:01.286 --> 55:03.653
[LAUGH]

55:03.822 --> 55:05.381
It's sure great being home, Mom.

55:05.557 --> 55:07.821
But I miss Nora. I wish she were here.

55:07.992 --> 55:09.892
CAROL:
Oh, yeah. So do I, Greg.

55:10.061 --> 55:12.029
- To Nora.
- Yes. Thank you.

55:12.197 --> 55:15.497
Okay, everybody. The tree's all ready.

55:15.667 --> 55:18.898
- Who wants to put on the star?
- Me, Grandpa! Me, me!

55:19.070 --> 55:21.937
Okay, it's you, you, you. Come on.
Greg, put him up on me shoulders.

55:22.106 --> 55:25.838
Okay. Come on, Mickey!
There you go! Up on Grandpa!

55:26.010 --> 55:27.944
- There's your star.
- Be careful.

55:28.112 --> 55:31.980
PETER: Give you a hand here.
- Be careful.

55:33.685 --> 55:35.414
[ALL CHEER]

55:35.587 --> 55:36.850
Okay. Hit the lights, Phil.

55:37.021 --> 55:39.718
- Phillip.
- Phillip.

55:39.891 --> 55:42.588
WALLY: Good job, good job.
BOBBY: Okay. Here we go.

55:42.760 --> 55:44.751
Here come the lights!

55:48.333 --> 55:52.463
ALL: <i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

55:52.637 --> 55:57.438
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey</i>

56:01.779 --> 56:03.338
[SIGHS]

56:06.618 --> 56:10.680
- Mom. Why is it so quiet?
- Mickey's not here.

56:10.855 --> 56:12.914
It's nice, isn't it?

56:13.091 --> 56:17.551
It's too quiet. It gives me time
to think about losing my job.

56:18.263 --> 56:21.028
When I think about losing my job,
I worry.

56:21.199 --> 56:23.258
When I worry, I get nervous.

56:23.434 --> 56:26.301
When I get nervous,
I start grinding my teeth.

56:26.471 --> 56:29.463
When I start grinding my teeth,
I think about going to the dentist.

56:29.641 --> 56:31.507
And you know he always finds
something wrong.

56:31.676 --> 56:34.873
And everything that he finds wrong
always costs a lot of money.

56:35.046 --> 56:37.014
And so then I start thinking about
the bill he's going to send me,

56:37.181 --> 56:39.115
and how I'm going to pay
for all that dental work.

56:39.284 --> 56:42.151
And it's dental work I wouldn't need,
if I didn't start grinding my teeth

56:42.320 --> 56:46.018
because I was worried about my job
that I lost in the first place! Ugh!

56:47.525 --> 56:50.756
It would be easier to have Mickey here.

57:02.907 --> 57:06.172
- I'm not pleased about this.
- You think I am?

57:06.344 --> 57:10.281
My parents think a double bed
is appropriate.

57:11.649 --> 57:15.882
- I don't like this any more than you do.
- In that case...

57:45.216 --> 57:47.844
Seems like old times,
doesn't it, Bobby?

57:48.019 --> 57:49.418
Just about. Heh.

57:49.587 --> 57:51.282
Hey, listen,
now that we're all grown up,

57:51.456 --> 57:52.753
do you mind being called Bobby?

57:52.924 --> 57:55.985
No. There have been a lot
of great men named Bobby.

57:56.160 --> 57:59.653
Well, yeah, like, um, Bobby Kennedy.

57:59.831 --> 58:03.233
And Bobby Unser, Bobby Allison,
Bobby Rahal...

58:03.401 --> 58:07.133
Hey, those guys are racecar drivers.
They're hardly great men.

58:07.305 --> 58:11.105
What? Bobby Unser won the Indy 500
three times.

58:11.275 --> 58:14.870
And when Bobby Rahal won it in '86,
he averaged over 170 miles an hour.

58:15.046 --> 58:18.209
- And Bobby Allison was the number--
- All right, Bobby. All right.

58:18.383 --> 58:21.011
How come you know so much
about racecar drivers?

58:23.087 --> 58:24.350
It's a hobby.

58:26.124 --> 58:27.717
You spend that much time
with your hobby,

58:27.892 --> 58:29.621
I'm surprised you have enough time
for your studies.

58:32.997 --> 58:35.694
- Peter, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

58:37.235 --> 58:39.067
I mean, really talk.

58:40.171 --> 58:42.230
Yeah.

58:51.249 --> 58:52.648
What's up?

58:53.584 --> 58:55.746
I'm not in school anymore.

58:55.920 --> 58:57.581
What?

58:57.755 --> 59:00.622
Mom and Dad are always telling me
how well you're doing in school.

59:00.792 --> 59:01.918
They don't know.

59:03.394 --> 59:08.525
- Well... when did you drop out?
- A year ago.

59:09.500 --> 59:11.332
Are you racing cars?

59:12.370 --> 59:14.134
- Yup.
- Heh.

59:14.305 --> 59:16.603
I know Mom and Dad would think
it was too dangerous.

59:16.774 --> 59:20.142
They want me in business school
adding assets and debits.

59:20.845 --> 59:22.108
When are you going to tell them?

59:23.815 --> 59:27.115
That's a big decision.
I kind of wanted your advice.

59:27.585 --> 59:28.677
Oh.

59:28.853 --> 59:31.550
Bobby, I can't even make

59:31.722 --> 59:34.623
big decisions for myself.

59:35.827 --> 59:39.195
- Your career's going great, isn't it?
- Yeah.

59:39.464 --> 59:42.593
I can't make up my mind about Valerie.

59:42.767 --> 59:44.064
Well, that's easy.

59:44.235 --> 59:46.727
I'll make up your mind for you.
She's great.

59:46.904 --> 59:49.396
I know she's great, Bobby.

59:51.242 --> 59:53.540
No one knows that better than I do.

59:53.711 --> 59:55.839
Well, do you want to marry her?

59:56.614 --> 59:57.740
Yeah.

59:57.915 --> 01:00:02.352
But she's my boss.
She makes more money than I do.

01:00:02.954 --> 01:00:04.388
$0?

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:07.058
It bothers me.

01:00:07.992 --> 01:00:10.791
Look, if you add your salaries
together and divide by two,

01:00:10.962 --> 01:00:12.760
you both make exactly the same.

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.193
[CHUCKLES]

01:00:15.433 --> 01:00:16.525
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:19.398
And who's to say
you're always going to be making less?

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.301
And even if you do make less,
does it really matter?

01:00:24.242 --> 01:00:27.303
Hey, now, wait a minute, I thought
you were asking me for advice.

01:00:27.979 --> 01:00:30.607
Well, Pete, a person has to face
a problem head-on.

01:00:32.817 --> 01:00:34.512
You got a point, Bobby.

01:00:36.654 --> 01:00:38.383
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:00:40.258 --> 01:00:42.226
Thanks for the advice.

01:00:43.194 --> 01:00:45.424
I always wished I had a big brother
or a big sister

01:00:45.596 --> 01:00:47.496
to help me work things out.

01:00:47.665 --> 01:00:51.363
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you something.
I have always been a little sister.

01:00:51.536 --> 01:00:54.403
And I've always been expected
to do what everybody else wants.

01:00:54.572 --> 01:00:59.100
- But you've got such a great family.
- I know, I know. And I like being here.

01:00:59.911 --> 01:01:01.936
But I was told to come home.

01:01:02.113 --> 01:01:04.548
Nobody asked me. They told me.

01:01:06.017 --> 01:01:08.952
Peter wasn't sure whether
he wanted me to come at all. Heh, heh.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.554
Why?

01:01:10.721 --> 01:01:13.213
He can't seem to make up his mind about me.

01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:14.483
[SCOFFS]

01:01:14.659 --> 01:01:17.492
You know, he's my brother,
and I love him, but he's an idiot.

01:01:17.662 --> 01:01:20.222
Hold on a second. You're calling
the man I love an idiot.

01:01:20.398 --> 01:01:22.696
Yes.
Look, does the idiot love you too?

01:01:23.501 --> 01:01:24.730
Yeah.

01:01:24.902 --> 01:01:27.803
So, what's the problem?
Does he want to marry you?

01:01:27.972 --> 01:01:30.634
Heh. Yeah.

01:01:30.808 --> 01:01:32.503
So, what's the problem?

01:01:32.677 --> 01:01:35.669
The problem is...

01:01:35.846 --> 01:01:38.645
I have a higher position
at the company than he does.

01:01:38.816 --> 01:01:41.786
So... the idiot won't ask me.

01:01:43.354 --> 01:01:46.688
- So ask him.
- What?

01:01:46.857 --> 01:01:49.952
Valerie, you're an independent woman.
You have your rights.

01:01:50.127 --> 01:01:52.824
If the idiot won't ask you,
ask the idiot.

01:01:52.997 --> 01:01:56.558
- Heh, heh. I can't do that.
- Why not?

01:01:59.704 --> 01:02:02.173
Heh. Yeah.

01:02:03.307 --> 01:02:05.207
Why not?

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:08.370
- You know something, Cindy?
- Mm?

01:02:08.546 --> 01:02:11.379
People really should listen to you.

01:02:11.882 --> 01:02:14.351
Would you mind spreading the word
to the rest of the family?

01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:17.954
- Ha, ha. Sure.
- Thanks.

01:02:55.092 --> 01:02:56.253
Thanks.

01:02:57.161 --> 01:02:59.789
That's okay. I'm used to it.

01:03:00.765 --> 01:03:02.164
What do you mean "used to it?"

01:03:04.969 --> 01:03:07.404
You always fell asleep
in the strangest places

01:03:07.571 --> 01:03:11.735
while you were doing research
or grading papers.

01:03:12.176 --> 01:03:13.302
And you'd cover me?

01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:15.969
Did you think
there was a blanket fairy?

01:03:17.782 --> 01:03:19.511
I never really thought about it.

01:03:21.152 --> 01:03:22.813
I know.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.453
Kevin. Wake up.

01:03:33.464 --> 01:03:36.593
- What?
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:03:36.767 --> 01:03:39.168
Well, go ahead.

01:03:42.039 --> 01:03:44.133
I'm not going alone.

01:03:44.308 --> 01:03:46.367
Ugh.

01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:07.557
- Hey. Where are you two guys going?
- The bathroom.

01:04:07.732 --> 01:04:12.169
- Have a good time.
- Kevin wanted me to take him.

01:04:23.013 --> 01:04:27.246
MICKEY: Look at the presents.
- I know.

01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:30.276
BOBBY:
Who's that?

01:04:30.454 --> 01:04:32.354
- Me, Uncle Bobby.
- Me too.

01:04:32.523 --> 01:04:35.015
We're going to the bathroom.

01:04:36.794 --> 01:04:39.525
One thing, Uncle Peter.
Where is the bathroom?

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:43.594
Uh, It's up there.
First door on your right.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.269
CINDY:
Hey, you two. Out of here!

01:04:51.442 --> 01:04:53.570
We thought you girls
were the bathroom.

01:04:53.744 --> 01:04:55.439
It's the second door.

01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:03.010
- It's the second door.
- Yeah!

01:05:06.957 --> 01:05:10.052
- You sent them in there on purpose.
- Uh-huh.

01:05:11.028 --> 01:05:14.464
Valerie wanted to know
what it was like to have a big family.

01:05:14.632 --> 01:05:17.033
[BOTH LAUGH]

01:05:26.143 --> 01:05:27.577
Hi.

01:05:28.012 --> 01:05:30.879
- Thought I heard someone out here.
- Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

01:05:31.048 --> 01:05:34.211
- Why not? I got Mickey with me.
- Ha, ha.

01:05:34.385 --> 01:05:36.717
You want a piece of pie?

01:05:36.887 --> 01:05:38.184
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:40.517
- Looks like one of Alice's specials.
- It is.

01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:42.853
Here, let the doctor make the incision.

01:05:43.027 --> 01:05:44.756
Professional.

01:05:45.563 --> 01:05:47.554
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.
- Yeah.

01:05:47.731 --> 01:05:49.859
I'm not used to being without Nora.

01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:53.828
Thought we heard
one of Alice's pies being sliced.

01:05:54.004 --> 01:05:56.336
- What are you guys doing up?
- Couldn't sleep.

01:05:56.507 --> 01:06:00.137
- Yeah. I got things on my mind.
- Well, here.

01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:02.939
Nothing like a piece of pie
to cure insomnia.

01:06:03.113 --> 01:06:04.740
Thanks, doc.

01:06:13.023 --> 01:06:14.013
Honey?

01:06:15.493 --> 01:06:17.257
What time is it?

01:06:17.928 --> 01:06:19.487
- Mike?
- Huh?

01:06:20.164 --> 01:06:23.099
Now. I don't like that "Mike."

01:06:23.267 --> 01:06:25.702
You say "Mike" like that
and something's bothering you.

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:26.928
What is it?

01:06:27.104 --> 01:06:29.971
Well, do you think that

01:29:28.784 --> 01:29:33.881
<i>Oh, come let us adore him</i>

01:29:34.056 --> 01:29:40.462
<i>Oh, come let us adore him</i>

01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:45.932
<i>Christ the Lord</i>

01:29:46.102 --> 01:29:51.666
<i>Oh, come all ye faithful</i>

01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:56.403
<i>Joyful and triumphant</i>

01:29:56.579 --> 01:29:59.640
<i>Oh, come ye</i>

01:29:59.815 --> 01:30:06.312
<i>Oh, come ye to Bethlehem</i>

01:30:06.489 --> 01:30:11.427
<i>Come and behold him</i>

01:30:11.594 --> 01:30:16.031
<i>Born the king of angels</i>

01:30:34.383 --> 01:30:37.148
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

01:30:45.795 --> 01:30:48.765
Folks, this is a Christmas story
with a really happy ending.

01:30:48.931 --> 01:30:52.526
And I just noticed
the street sign on the corner.

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:57.736
It looks like another miracle
on 34th Street.

01:31:08.884 --> 01:31:09.874
MICKEY: This is great.

01:31:10.052 --> 01:31:12.612
Alice, this is the best Christmas dinner

01:31:12.788 --> 01:31:15.280
in the history of reheated
Christmas dinners.

01:31:15.458 --> 01:31:16.948
Hear, hear, hear.

01:31:17.126 --> 01:31:20.152
Well, it would have been better
if it had had my pies.

01:31:20.329 --> 01:31:21.387
[ALL GROAN]

01:31:21.564 --> 01:31:23.464
Alice, we confess.

01:31:23.632 --> 01:31:26.533
The whole bunch of us
finished off those pies last night.

01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:29.103
- That's terrible.
- What bunch? I didn't get any.

01:31:29.271 --> 01:31:30.261
[DOORBELL RINGS]

01:31:30.439 --> 01:31:33.431
- Yep-- Sit still. I'll get the door.
- When do I get to finish my speech?

01:31:33.609 --> 01:31:36.101
Oh, honey, give that up,
why don't you.

01:31:36.278 --> 01:31:38.872
Coming, coming, coming, coming.

01:31:40.349 --> 01:31:41.680
Santa!

01:31:41.851 --> 01:31:46.015
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

01:31:46.188 --> 01:31:48.179
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

01:31:48.357 --> 01:31:51.088
- Santa!
- Santa Claus! Oh, Santa!

01:31:53.529 --> 01:31:55.361
- Santa!
- Merry Christmas, Santa!

01:31:55.531 --> 01:31:58.728
If you're really Santa Claus,
where's your bag of presents?

01:31:58.901 --> 01:32:02.701
Oh, sorry, kids.
I just have one present. For Alice.

01:32:02.872 --> 01:32:04.306
Phoo.

01:32:04.473 --> 01:32:07.101
Oh, I didn't mean to break up
your Christmas dinner.

01:32:07.276 --> 01:32:10.109
- I'm sorry, folks.
- Well, that's all right, Santa.

01:32:10.279 --> 01:32:11.303
Whoever you are.

01:32:12.114 --> 01:32:14.412
Did you say
you had a present for me?

01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:20.113
- Yeah. I brought you me.
- Sam?

01:32:21.323 --> 01:32:22.654
It's Sam.

01:32:22.825 --> 01:32:28.195
I've been a fool, Alice. It's Christmas.
Please have the spirit.

01:32:28.364 --> 01:32:31.197
Do you have it in your heart
to take me back?

01:32:31.367 --> 01:32:34.997
Sam, don't you ever do anything
like that again.

01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:38.766
Oh, I won't. I promise.

01:32:38.941 --> 01:32:40.375
You're top sirloin.

01:32:40.543 --> 01:32:44.480
Next to you, everybody else
is just chopped liver.

01:32:44.647 --> 01:32:46.638
Looks like we all got
our Christmas wishes.

01:32:46.816 --> 01:32:48.250
We wish you a Merry Christmas.

01:32:48.417 --> 01:32:52.979
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

01:32:53.155 --> 01:32:59.652
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy new year</i>

01:32:59.829 --> 01:33:02.264
ALL: Merry Christmas!
