Oh.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.111
Perjury is when
you lie --

19:05.144 --> 19:06.846
Oh, like that dope-ass movie
where everything's legal

19:06.879 --> 19:08.781
for like a day?
That's "The Purge."

19:08.815 --> 19:12.018
Perjury is when
you lie under oath.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.620
Have you
committed perjury?

19:13.653 --> 19:16.055
No, I have not
committed perjury.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.324
And yet you testified

19:17.357 --> 19:20.293
that Principal Quinn
is your best friend.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.229
Yes. Sure. Whatever.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.696
People's Exhibit C.

19:23.730 --> 19:27.133
This is the visitor's log
from the Denver County Jail.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.736
Would you care to guess
whose name is not on it?

19:29.769 --> 19:33.139
Hey, objection.
Uh, Loren is a very busy guy.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.341
Overruled.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.343
Your name isn't on it,
Mr. Payton,

19:36.376 --> 19:39.078
because you never visited
the defendant in jail.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.314
But surely
you would have called

19:41.348 --> 19:43.316
your best friend
in prison, right?

19:43.350 --> 19:44.651
You know,
I don't remember.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.885
I do.

19:45.918 --> 19:49.021
Not only did you not call
the defendant in prison,

19:49.055 --> 19:50.823
but according
to these phone records,

19:50.857 --> 19:52.859
you've never
called him at all.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.327
Objection. [ Laughs ]

19:54.361 --> 19:57.997

never call their best friends.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.333
Mr. Payton,
if you called

20:00.367 --> 20:03.270
a particular number
81 times,

20:03.303 --> 20:06.539
surely that person would be
your best friend, right?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.375
Yeah, right.
It's probably just

20:08.408 --> 20:11.210
some sweet side piece
I was working at the time.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.679
Please, please
be a video.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.381
Okay, I-I'm just
gonna call the number.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.349
No, you don't -- You don't have
to actually call him. That's --

20:16.383 --> 20:17.850
Yeah, give me a second.
I'm just gonna call him.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.185
No, it's good.
It's good.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.221
Cody: Yo, this is Cody.
You know what to do.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.457
And if this is Loren,
stop calling, dude.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.025
It's weird.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.232
You sure you don't want
to leave a message?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.536
Hey, Codes,

20:36.569 --> 20:38.438
Dude! Ha ha!
Hilarious message!

How's stuff at college?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.320
Oh, why not?

20:53.353 --> 20:56.255
Loren, I apologize

20:56.289 --> 20:58.291
that I am not
the kind of friend

20:58.325 --> 21:01.260
that you would ever want
to come and visit.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.895
And I don't know
who Cody is,

21:02.929 --> 21:06.032
but he sounds like
a pretty lucky guy to me.

No further feelings,
Your Honor.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.903
Can I -- Can I
be done with this?

21:10.937 --> 21:14.106
Please. Please. Go.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.211
I'm sorry, Quinn.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.284
Bravo.

21:31.958 --> 21:32.592
I'm ready
to give my verdict.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.663
Geoffrey Quinn, please rise.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.967
All right.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.635
I have witnessed here today

21:42.669 --> 21:46.973
a litany of perjury,
poor character,

21:47.006 --> 21:49.442
and terrible fashion choices.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.144
But thanks to the prosecution,

21:52.178 --> 21:54.647
I was able to view the tape.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.884
Clearly there was no intent

21:57.917 --> 22:00.987
to expose yourself to students.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.023
Now, I knew this,
but I wanted to see

22:04.056 --> 22:06.192
if you could get there
on your own.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.194
Plus, I get paid hourly.

22:08.227 --> 22:13.165
I find you not guilty.
You're free to go.

Oh! I almost forgot!

22:23.209 --> 22:25.678
Mr. Shoemaker,
you'll be contacted

for nothing, Principal Goodman.

Oh, go on.
Quinn: Tam! Tam!

Well, I got to say,

22:56.443 --> 22:59.345
this place didn't look this good
when I was principal.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.549
Maybe Smoot is better off
without me.

Well, there you have it
from the horse's mouth.

to write down
