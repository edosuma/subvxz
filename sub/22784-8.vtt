-Hey, come on, man, listen.

28:29.332 --> 28:32.585
I appreciate what you did for me, fam,
but let's keep it real, all right?

28:32.669 --> 28:36.589
You sat for a something you put me on
to do because you said I was a juvy.

28:36.673 --> 28:41.344
But we both know that was a long time ago
in a bleak galaxy far, far away.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.973

My silent partner.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.476

with your business, bro.

Yo, Jamie, B, that fuckin' Shemekka shit,
that's the least of your fuckin' worries.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.906
And you know what the fuck
I'm talkin' about, little cuz.

29:01.990 --> 29:06.536
-You got more to lose than me.
-You sure about that? Huh?

29:06.619 --> 29:10.081

from back in the day,

29:10.165 --> 29:12.917

For certain situations,
there's no statute of limitations.

You ain't the real soda.
Matter of fact, when you was little,

29:33.855 --> 29:36.441
you was talkin' like
a fuckin' little white boy.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.568
I schooled you to the game, Jamie.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.528
You ain't got no fuckin' flavor.
