WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:01.110
<i>Previously on Suits</i>

00:01.484 --> 00:03.645
Gordon doesn't want a takeover.
He wants a deal

00:03.645 --> 00:06.315
where his guys come back,
they vote to merge with Zane,

00:06.315 --> 00:08.405
- and we cease to exist.
- I found out

00:08.405 --> 00:10.775
my two partners,
Eric Kaldor and Ellen Rand,

00:10.775 --> 00:12.865
are willing to stab me in the back.

00:12.865 --> 00:15.155
We don't need
the sex phone anymore,

00:15.155 --> 00:16.615
because you hit the bull's eye.

00:16.615 --> 00:18.785
Oh, my God.
My boys can swim?

00:18.785 --> 00:20.915
I've got a legal situation.
It's personal.

00:20.915 --> 00:22.795
You need me to send one
of ours your way.

00:22.795 --> 00:25.715
- I was thinking Alex Williams.
- I guess firm harmony

00:25.715 --> 00:27.545
is why you want Alex
and not Samantha.

00:27.545 --> 00:29.755
That and a little of
the nature of the case.

00:29.755 --> 00:31.465
I got my period.
I'm not pregnant.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.675
But the test said...
It was a false positive.

00:33.675 --> 00:34.805
I'm so sorry.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.305
Samantha Wheeler.

00:42.305 --> 00:44.685
Normally I'm happy to see
a former colleague.

00:44.685 --> 00:47.695
Just not one that walked out
the door with half our business.

00:47.695 --> 00:49.985
Then you're really
gonna hate it when I attack

00:49.985 --> 00:52.115
what little business
you have left.

00:55.825 --> 00:58.115
You're suing Grayscale.
I'm not.

00:58.115 --> 00:59.865
The federal government is.
Bullshit.

00:59.865 --> 01:01.745
You don't represent
the government.

01:01.745 --> 01:04.955
If a company defrauds
the United States,

01:04.955 --> 01:07.255
any attorney can sue
to reclaim those damages.

01:07.255 --> 01:09.085
You can spout any Act you want.

01:09.085 --> 01:11.795
There's no way you give a shit
about the government.

01:11.795 --> 01:13.385
I don't.
But what I do care about

01:13.385 --> 01:15.885
is Grayscale coming over to us
like they wanted.

01:15.885 --> 01:17.515
They never wanted
to go with you.

01:17.515 --> 01:19.635
Why are you holding them
to their agreement?

01:19.635 --> 01:21.555
And before you answer,
we both know

01:21.555 --> 01:24.475
it's because if you
let them go, they'd leave.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.185
Well, they might have.
But now that you're suing them,

01:27.185 --> 01:29.235
you just tipped
the gray scales my way.

01:29.235 --> 01:31.485
I forgot you and your puns.

01:31.485 --> 01:35.155
Well, I don't have to pretend
they're charming anymore.

01:35.155 --> 01:37.655
So this is how it's gonna go.

01:37.655 --> 01:39.455
I'm gonna get you in a bear hug.

01:39.455 --> 01:42.245
Your only way out is
to let them come to us.

01:42.245 --> 01:44.915
So you can do it now
or you can do it later,

01:44.915 --> 01:47.295
but trust me, it's gonna happen.

01:47.295 --> 01:50.375
Thank you for stopping by,
Samantha.

01:50.375 --> 01:53.135
I'd forgotten how much nicer
it is since you've been gone.

01:57.715 --> 02:00.225
Louis, what are
you still doing here?

02:00.225 --> 02:03.855
I took the day off.
And I called your office.

02:03.855 --> 02:05.395
You're taking the day off too.

02:05.395 --> 02:06.815
But... No buts.

02:06.815 --> 02:09.354
I am taking you to
the happiest place on Earth.

02:09.354 --> 02:13.775
Louis, as much as I love
Colonial Williamsburg,

02:13.775 --> 02:15.065
I can't today.

02:15.065 --> 02:16.825
Our costumes are already
in the car.

02:16.825 --> 02:18.235
I appreciate that, Louis.

02:18.235 --> 02:20.825
And it's sweet
you wanna distract me

02:20.825 --> 02:23.075
from what happened.

02:23.075 --> 02:26.585
But I was already planning on
taking today off, anyway.

02:26.585 --> 02:28.665
You were?
Yeah.

02:28.665 --> 02:31.715
Louis, we had a false positive.

02:31.715 --> 02:33.215
If we want a real positive,

02:33.215 --> 02:35.795
we have to stop
leaving things to chance.

02:35.795 --> 02:38.305
So I made an appointment

02:38.305 --> 02:41.225
with the top fertility
specialist in the country.

02:41.225 --> 02:43.095
You really think
we need a specialist?

02:43.095 --> 02:44.975
I think these things
can take time.

02:44.975 --> 02:46.895
So the sooner we get some help,

02:46.895 --> 02:49.225
the sooner we can hold
that baby in our arms.

02:49.225 --> 02:50.565
What are we waiting for?

02:50.565 --> 02:53.445
You don't have to come.
Listen to me.

02:53.445 --> 02:55.775
This is as important to me
as it is to you.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.615
And there is nothing
on this earth

02:57.615 --> 02:59.735
that's gonna stop me
from being by your side.

03:04.995 --> 03:07.165
Samantha, can I talk to you
for a second?

03:07.165 --> 03:08.665
I'm a little busy right now.

03:08.665 --> 03:10.545
What you mean is,
you're a little busy

03:10.545 --> 03:13.505
leveraging Eric Kaldor into
giving us one of his clients.

03:13.505 --> 03:16.005
Yeah, that's what I said.
You think this is funny?

03:16.005 --> 03:18.345
I think Robert has been
going through something.

03:18.345 --> 03:21.055
I wanna get him a little
present for when he gets back.

03:21.055 --> 03:23.425
In other words, you heard
Robert and Alex bonded

03:23.425 --> 03:25.345
over whatever he's been
going through,

03:25.345 --> 03:27.645
you feel your chair
at the table's moving down,

03:27.645 --> 03:29.265
and you're trying to move it up.

03:29.265 --> 03:30.725
So what if I am?

03:30.725 --> 03:33.025
The present you get him
better be that client.

03:33.025 --> 03:35.485
Eric Kaldor is no lightweight.

03:35.485 --> 03:38.445
And last I checked, the cases
I take aren't your concern.

03:38.445 --> 03:39.985
They are
if there's a possibility

03:39.985 --> 03:41.945
they could affect
this firm's record.

03:41.945 --> 03:44.285
So if you take this guy on,
you better win.

03:44.285 --> 03:46.785
That won't be a problem.
I know how Kaldor thinks.

03:46.785 --> 03:48.125
I'm sure you do.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.085
But in this instance,
you picked a fight

03:50.085 --> 03:52.915
with the one person
who wants to beat you more.

03:52.915 --> 03:55.005
I picked this fight.
I'm not backing down.

03:55.005 --> 03:57.835
Unless you wanna give me a
direct order I wouldn't follow,

03:57.835 --> 03:59.425
I suggest you get out of my way,

03:59.425 --> 04:00.885
'cause I got a case to win.

04:43.135 --> 04:45.135
Gretchen,
where the hell is Louis?

04:45.135 --> 04:47.515
You wanna try that again
with some civility?

04:47.515 --> 04:49.935
What? How about, "Good
morning, Gretchen.

04:49.935 --> 04:52.895
You look lovely today.
I brought you this fine latte."

04:52.895 --> 04:55.225
You're right. I'm coming up
against a deadline,

04:55.225 --> 04:56.815
but that's no excuse to be rude.

04:56.815 --> 04:59.445
Good morning, Gretchen.
Don't you look lovely.

04:59.445 --> 05:02.325
Now didn't that feel better?
Actually, it did.

05:02.325 --> 05:04.995
It will feel better
when you tell me where Louis is.

05:04.995 --> 05:06.615
I'm not so sure I will.

05:06.615 --> 05:08.865
Louis is gone for the day.
Shit.

05:08.865 --> 05:10.575
What's the problem?
White Mountain Water's

05:10.575 --> 05:12.835
putting together
a national distribution deal.

05:12.835 --> 05:15.625
We have to agree not to rep
any competition for a year.

05:15.625 --> 05:18.125
You need Louis' approval
for a commitment like that.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.425
He already agreed,
I just need his signature.

05:20.425 --> 05:22.425
I need it by the end of the day.

05:22.425 --> 05:25.845
Now it's my turn to say "shit".
Gretchen, I need that signature.

05:25.845 --> 05:27.675
And you will get it.
I'm saying "shit"

05:27.675 --> 05:29.385
'cause I know
where I have to go.

05:29.385 --> 05:31.805
Gretchen.
Alex, just give me the document.

05:31.805 --> 05:33.645
Tell me where you need me
to send it.

05:33.645 --> 05:36.815
I give you my word,
it will get there.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.605
Hey.

05:39.605 --> 05:42.195
Cucumber or eucalyptus?

05:42.195 --> 05:44.025
They have both?
They have everything.

05:44.025 --> 05:46.865
See the waiting room? Leather
seats, soothing lighting...

05:46.865 --> 05:48.615
I haven't met him,
but I love him.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.785
- Ms. Sazs. Mr. Litt.
- Dr. McManus.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.165
Thank you for seeing us
on such short notice.

05:54.165 --> 05:56.205
No "doctor" necessary.
I'm Charles,

05:56.205 --> 05:58.415
but everybody calls me... Chaz.

05:58.415 --> 05:59.965
Chaz McManus.

05:59.965 --> 06:02.335
That's right. Usually,
people guess Chuck. Heh.

06:02.335 --> 06:04.545
I have your files,
but I prefer to establish

06:04.545 --> 06:06.595
baseline health myself.
Is that okay?

06:06.595 --> 06:08.515
Of course.
Uh, what do you need me to do?

06:08.515 --> 06:10.185
We'll start with blood samples.

06:10.185 --> 06:12.805
So just head down that hall.
The nurse will show you.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.225
We can discuss
everything the two of you

06:15.225 --> 06:17.645
would like to accomplish.
Okay.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.775
I'll see you in a bit.

06:19.775 --> 06:21.065
I'm sorry.

06:21.065 --> 06:24.315
Do you not, uh...
remember me?

06:24.315 --> 06:27.275
I, uh...
Louis Litt.

06:27.275 --> 06:29.865
Scarsdale High.
Class of '88?

06:29.865 --> 06:31.745
I'm sorry,
I don't remember you, Louis.

06:31.745 --> 06:34.165
I never felt like I fit in
during high school.

06:34.165 --> 06:35.835
I don't think about those days.

06:35.835 --> 06:38.545
But I also know I wasn't
the nicest kid back then.

06:38.545 --> 06:40.585
If there's any bad blood
between us,

06:40.585 --> 06:42.715
I hope there's no hard feelings.

06:47.055 --> 06:49.805
So there she was,
feet in the stirrups,

06:49.805 --> 06:52.385
Louis looking, both of them
in hospital gowns...

06:52.385 --> 06:54.265
Wait, why was Louis in a gown?

06:54.265 --> 06:57.395
He didn't want her to feel self-conscious.
That's sweet.

06:57.395 --> 06:59.725
You get to say that
because you weren't there.

06:59.725 --> 07:01.185
I shouldn't have to remind you,

07:01.185 --> 07:03.855
those gowns don't close
in the behind.

07:03.855 --> 07:06.115
So between Louis and Sheila,

07:06.115 --> 07:08.405
I had to walk that document in
like this:

07:08.405 --> 07:10.785
Come on. Was she really
in the stirrups?

07:10.785 --> 07:13.405
I caught 'em
before they went in.

07:13.405 --> 07:15.825
That was the movie
that was playing in my head.

07:15.825 --> 07:18.205
So as far as I'm concerned,
it's just as bad.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.745
Well, the important thing is,

07:19.745 --> 07:22.715
Alex got his signature,
and the score remains

07:22.715 --> 07:26.795
Gretchen: 1,000,973.
World: Zero.

07:26.795 --> 07:28.305
Damn right.

07:28.305 --> 07:30.305
Good luck with your stack, Red.

07:30.305 --> 07:31.595
You too, Gretchen.

07:31.595 --> 07:34.385
Oh. And whatever you do,

07:34.385 --> 07:37.225
try not to buy another ticket
to that movie.

07:39.355 --> 07:43.395
She just had to say that.

07:43.395 --> 07:47.485
Mr. Kaldor, this trial is not
scheduled for another two weeks.

07:47.485 --> 07:49.775
You'd better have a good reason
for calling us.

07:49.775 --> 07:51.235
I do. I would like you

07:51.235 --> 07:53.325
to remove Ms. Wheeler
from this case.

07:53.325 --> 07:55.495
On what grounds?
On the grounds that you were

07:55.495 --> 07:57.535
an attorney of record
for my client.

07:57.535 --> 07:59.035
Is that true?
Absolutely not.

07:59.035 --> 08:00.875
I never worked on their case.

08:00.875 --> 08:05.005
Well, according to this billing
sheet, uh, you absolutely did.

08:06.335 --> 08:08.795
This was seven years ago
for two hours.

08:08.795 --> 08:10.505
Your Honor, I was an associate.

08:10.505 --> 08:13.055
Someone must've told me
to run copies and bill it.

08:13.055 --> 08:15.095
A minute ago,
you never worked for them.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.435
Now it's running copies?

08:16.435 --> 08:18.395
Your Honor.
This is your billing sheet?

08:18.395 --> 08:22.185
I mean, this is your
signature, isn't it? Yes.

08:22.185 --> 08:24.565
But even if I technically
worked for Grayscale,

08:24.565 --> 08:26.815
I never had access
to privileged information.

08:26.815 --> 08:28.775
Unless you're lying about
your billables,

08:28.775 --> 08:31.365
a disbarrable offense.
Then, technically or not,

08:31.365 --> 08:32.905
you're bound by privilege.

08:32.905 --> 08:35.325
Your Honor, she's prohibited
from bringing suit

08:35.325 --> 08:37.575
against an old client.

08:37.575 --> 08:39.875
I'm afraid he's right,
Ms. Wheeler.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.955
Unless there's someone else
from your firm

08:41.955 --> 08:44.795
not bound by privilege,
this case is dismissed.

08:48.755 --> 08:50.965
Louis. You
little piece of shit.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.845
You ratted me out
for cheating in bio.

08:52.845 --> 08:55.135
You're right, I did.
Because it isn't fair,

08:55.135 --> 08:56.805
Mr. O'Connor
grades on the curve.

08:56.805 --> 08:58.435
That sounded like talk-back.
Aah!

08:58.435 --> 09:00.805
Now, because of you,
O'Connor gave me an F,

09:00.805 --> 09:03.515
and my old man is gonna kill me.
Know what that means?

09:03.515 --> 09:05.935
You're gonna do my homework
the rest of the year.

09:05.935 --> 09:07.945
You're not gonna say
a word about it.

09:07.945 --> 09:09.985
No, I'm not.
And you can't make me.

09:09.985 --> 09:12.575
Maybe you weren't listening.
I don't know bio.

09:12.575 --> 09:14.865
Which means I don't know
where the kidneys are.

09:14.865 --> 09:16.115
Now, are they here?
Aah!

09:16.115 --> 09:17.075
Here?

09:17.075 --> 09:18.495
Or here?

09:18.495 --> 09:20.825
Still have
philosophical reservations?

09:20.825 --> 09:24.045
Okay, I'll do it.
Just please, let me go.

09:24.045 --> 09:25.255
That's my boy.

09:25.255 --> 09:27.215
Every day, before first bell,

09:27.215 --> 09:28.965
that day's homework
is in my hands.

09:28.965 --> 09:31.005
You're ever late,
we're gonna take a trip

09:31.005 --> 09:33.675
to the equipment locker
in front of the whole school,

09:33.675 --> 09:36.135
and I'm gonna lock you in.

09:43.685 --> 09:46.605
I spent the rest of the year
racing to school,

09:46.605 --> 09:48.985
just terrified I'd be late.

09:48.985 --> 09:52.275
The first time I was,
Chaz was true to his word.

09:52.275 --> 09:53.525
He dragged me to the gym,

09:53.525 --> 09:56.195
shoved me into
an equipment locker,

09:56.195 --> 09:57.995
and said that if I
ever told anyone,

09:57.995 --> 09:59.205
next time would be worse.

09:59.205 --> 10:01.415
You've told me
what a hard time you had

10:01.415 --> 10:03.665
in your youth, but this...

10:03.665 --> 10:06.585
That's not even the part
that I've been thinking about.

10:06.585 --> 10:09.295
You see, by the end,

10:09.295 --> 10:11.505
I just stopped fighting.

10:11.505 --> 10:14.255
So if I was late, Chaz would
walk me down the hall,

10:14.255 --> 10:15.545
we'd get to the gym,

10:15.545 --> 10:18.385
he'd open up
the equipment locker door,

10:18.385 --> 10:20.555
I'd hand him his homework,

10:20.555 --> 10:23.145
and I would walk myself
right in.

10:23.145 --> 10:25.895
I can only imagine
what you must have felt

10:25.895 --> 10:28.105
when you saw him again
after all this time.

10:28.105 --> 10:31.645
All he had to say about it was,
"No hard feelings."

10:31.645 --> 10:33.235
Well, there are hard feelings.

10:33.235 --> 10:35.905
Feelings you have been carrying
with you ever since.

10:35.905 --> 10:38.235
That's why
I wanna show you this.

10:38.235 --> 10:41.745
It's something that I haven't
looked at in 30 years.

10:48.625 --> 10:51.255
Louis, what did Sheila say
when you showed her this?

10:51.255 --> 10:52.925
Show her?
No, I couldn't do that.

10:52.925 --> 10:54.425
Why not?

10:54.425 --> 10:56.675
I've been doing research
since we left,

10:56.675 --> 10:58.135
hoping that it wasn't true.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.175
But there's nobody
better than this guy.

11:00.175 --> 11:03.055
If we want our best chances
to have this baby,

11:03.055 --> 11:06.555
I just have to deal with
these feelings.

11:06.555 --> 11:10.935
Then at least let Sheila in on
what you are going through.

11:10.935 --> 11:12.815
Because if you don't
let off some steam,

11:12.815 --> 11:16.195
there is likely to be
an explosion.

11:23.325 --> 11:26.285
Harvey? I'm sorry to bother you,
but do you have a minute?

11:26.285 --> 11:27.995
Ha!
I don't believe this.

11:27.995 --> 11:30.625
Shit went sideways with
your case, and you want help.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.465
I didn't say that.
You didn't need to.

11:32.465 --> 11:35.545
You're here with your
pass-the-butter voice,

11:35.545 --> 11:37.345
and I warned you
this would happen.

11:37.345 --> 11:38.965
Maybe you did, but...
Not "maybe".

11:38.965 --> 11:41.555
I said you were picking
a fight with the wrong guy,

11:41.555 --> 11:43.885
and you said
you knew what you were doing.

11:43.885 --> 11:45.225
Okay, Harvey.

11:45.225 --> 11:46.895
You were right.

11:46.895 --> 11:49.775
Wanna say, "I told you so",
or wanna help me beat this guy?

11:49.775 --> 11:51.275
You don't know what I wanna do.

11:51.275 --> 11:54.025
I can't do that,
I guess I have to help you.

11:54.025 --> 11:56.905
If what you're wanting to do
is take a swing at me,

11:56.905 --> 11:59.155
we can take this into the ring
once we're done.

11:59.155 --> 12:01.365
I meant, I wanna tape
your mouth shut.

12:01.365 --> 12:04.325
But I heard you talk a big game
with your boxing.

12:04.325 --> 12:07.125
And trust me, you don't want
a piece of this.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.125
I don't just box, Harvey,
I kickbox.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.295
And my leg is 50 times stronger
than your arm.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.415
Picking fights
outside your weight class

12:13.415 --> 12:15.795
is how you got into this mess
in the first place.

12:15.795 --> 12:18.715
You wanna figure out how
to get out of it, or you wanna

12:18.715 --> 12:21.175
make up fairy tales
about how you'd kick my ass?

12:21.175 --> 12:23.265
I wanna figure out
how to get out of this.

12:23.265 --> 12:24.885
We're gonna go upstairs
and order

12:24.885 --> 12:26.685
an extra-large pepperoni
and cheese.

12:26.685 --> 12:28.855
Because I might not
have picked this fight,

12:28.855 --> 12:33.185
but there is no way I am letting
Eric "I Need a Haircut" Kaldor

12:33.185 --> 12:35.775
get the better
of one of my people.

12:39.735 --> 12:40.905
Hey.

12:42.445 --> 12:44.655
Oh, what is this for?

12:46.745 --> 12:49.335
For being by my side today.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.495
Of course.
I told you that I would be.

12:51.495 --> 12:53.045
Well, it really set me at ease.

12:53.045 --> 12:57.125
And I have to say,
Chaz is so knowledgeable,

12:57.125 --> 12:59.755
and his bedside manner
is a dream.

12:59.755 --> 13:02.215
Right. He's the best.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.135
We're gonna be swimming
in babies by the time

13:05.135 --> 13:06.385
he's through with us.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.265
Louis, what's wrong?

13:09.855 --> 13:11.855
Chaz was my bully
in high school.

13:11.855 --> 13:15.145
He tortured me
my entire junior year.

13:15.145 --> 13:18.155
That's awful. Why didn't you
say something to me?

13:18.155 --> 13:19.565
It was 30 years ago.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.735
I'm not gonna let
something from high school

13:21.735 --> 13:23.735
keep us from seeing
the best specialist.

13:23.735 --> 13:25.535
We can find
whoever's second best.

13:25.535 --> 13:27.455
No, we can't.
If it didn't work out,

13:27.455 --> 13:29.205
I would never forgive myself.

13:29.205 --> 13:31.125
I can handle it.

13:31.125 --> 13:35.125
Are you sure?
Trust me, I'll be okay.

13:36.835 --> 13:40.215
Carla, I got your message.
I came as soon as I could.

13:40.215 --> 13:43.055
You need to use that retainer
we pay to buy a faster car.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.555
I found out we no longer have
a distribution deal.

13:45.555 --> 13:47.595
What are you talking about?
Our distributor

13:47.595 --> 13:48.975
you said we had a deal with

13:48.975 --> 13:50.895
called to say
they got a better offer.

13:50.895 --> 13:53.565
If they have a competing offer
that fast, they've been

13:53.565 --> 13:56.065
negotiating in bad faith.
I don't give a shit.

13:56.065 --> 13:58.275
I wanna know
what you're gonna do about it.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.105
The only way
they can break our deal

14:00.105 --> 14:01.945
is if that signature
didn't get there.

14:01.945 --> 14:04.115
If they try to back out...
Don't you get it?

14:04.115 --> 14:05.655
There is no other reason.

14:05.655 --> 14:08.825
They're saying that signature
never got there.

14:08.825 --> 14:11.325
Carla, I'm telling you,
that signature got there,

14:11.325 --> 14:13.285
and they're not backing out
of anything.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.995
You'd better be right.

14:14.995 --> 14:17.835
Because our future
is based on this expansion.

14:17.835 --> 14:21.885
And like I said,
you told me it was a done deal.

14:27.265 --> 14:30.515
Tell me you sent
Louis' signature over today.

14:30.515 --> 14:31.895
I did. Why?

14:31.895 --> 14:33.645
They're saying
they never got it.

14:33.645 --> 14:35.065
That's some grade A bullshit.

14:35.065 --> 14:37.185
The courier came and took it
this afternoon.

14:37.185 --> 14:38.935
The courier failed to deliver...

14:38.935 --> 14:40.945
Or these guys
are straight up lying.

14:40.945 --> 14:43.155
I need you to get me a receipt.

14:43.155 --> 14:45.735
Then you'll have it by tomorrow.
Don't worry.

14:45.735 --> 14:46.785
We'll fix this.

14:46.785 --> 14:47.985
Thanks, Gretchen.

14:47.985 --> 14:50.285
I appreciate you
being all over this.

14:52.995 --> 14:54.745
Hold on.

14:54.745 --> 14:58.205
If we can prove you never had
any contact with Grayscale,

14:58.205 --> 15:01.165
we can argue no privilege
relationship existed.

15:01.165 --> 15:02.545
It's an idea.

15:02.545 --> 15:04.755
Even if we subpoena
everybody from back then,

15:04.755 --> 15:06.845
it's not in their interest
to clear me.

15:06.845 --> 15:09.595
Plus, Kaldor could
still say it doesn't matter

15:09.595 --> 15:11.725
because you saw
confidential information.

15:11.725 --> 15:13.555
Goddamn that man.

15:13.555 --> 15:16.315
All I wanted was to get Robert
another client.

15:16.315 --> 15:20.145
No, you're a saint and all you
were doing was God's work.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.105
All right,
you don't have to rub it in.

15:22.105 --> 15:24.855
I do if we're gonna have
any fun tonight.

15:24.855 --> 15:26.275
Speaking of fun...

15:26.275 --> 15:28.485
It's late,
we just shared a pizza,

15:28.485 --> 15:30.785
I have to ask:
What is it with you and Robert?

15:30.785 --> 15:33.115
I'm not talking about
me and Robert with you.

15:33.115 --> 15:35.455
You can tell Donna,
but you can't tell me?

15:35.455 --> 15:37.375
You know we went out?
Of course I do.

15:37.375 --> 15:38.995
I know everything.

15:38.995 --> 15:41.005
Even the time
that you tried to...

15:41.005 --> 15:42.375
No. You don't know anything.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.505
You're trying to get me
to spill the beans

15:44.505 --> 15:46.885
because Donna wouldn't.
So what if I am?

15:46.885 --> 15:48.885
Hmm. That's exactly
what I said to you

15:48.885 --> 15:51.635
when you called me out
on doing this because of Alex.

15:51.635 --> 15:53.385
So what if I am?

15:53.385 --> 15:55.935
Maybe we're more alike
than you thought, after all.

15:55.935 --> 15:58.685
That's what you tried telling me
when you first got here

15:58.685 --> 16:00.645
when you flipped me the bird.

16:00.645 --> 16:02.565
As I recall,
you flipped it right back.

16:02.565 --> 16:04.735
Yeah, well,
maybe we really are...

16:04.735 --> 16:07.405
Wait a second.
More alike than we thought.

16:07.405 --> 16:09.025
What if it's
not just you and me?

16:09.025 --> 16:10.785
What have you got?
Kaldor.

16:10.785 --> 16:12.745
He said the only way I could
get around the billing sheet

16:12.745 --> 16:14.535
was to say I'd lied about it.

16:14.535 --> 16:17.415
What if he's the one who lied,
and that sheet never existed?

16:17.415 --> 16:20.165
Looks like someone needs to pay
a visit to Eric Kaldor.

16:20.165 --> 16:22.415
You think you can handle it?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.295
Why would I handle it?
Because...

16:25.295 --> 16:28.465
You helped me
when you didn't have to,

16:28.465 --> 16:30.755
and you just said
you wanted to have some fun.

16:30.755 --> 16:32.305
What better way to have some fun

16:32.305 --> 16:34.345
than sticking it to Eric Kaldor?
I get it.

16:34.345 --> 16:36.765
You don't just wanna get
Robert a present.

16:36.765 --> 16:40.645
You wanna get me personally
invested in your success.

16:40.645 --> 16:42.315
So what if I do?

16:42.315 --> 16:44.485
Okay, Samantha,
I'll take care of Eric.

16:44.485 --> 16:46.315
But before we call it a night,

16:46.315 --> 16:49.655
this idea came from you
suggesting you're like him.

16:49.655 --> 16:52.745
And then, you started talking
about fabricating evidence.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.575
The answer is no, Harvey.

16:54.575 --> 16:57.825
I've never fabricated evidence
in my life.

16:59.835 --> 17:01.955
Hi. I need a receipt
for a package

17:01.955 --> 17:03.205
I sent with your service.

17:03.205 --> 17:04.954
Of course.
What's your order number?

17:04.954 --> 17:07.375
One-two-six-five-seven.

17:08.925 --> 17:11.464
Our records show
that package was never sent.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.714
Your records are wrong.
I sent it.

17:13.714 --> 17:15.885
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

17:15.885 --> 17:18.265
Don't say anything.
Put me through to the courier.

17:18.265 --> 17:21.355
If there's no record, talking
to him isn't gonna help.

17:21.355 --> 17:24.224
Our couriers are extremely busy,
and I don't have time to...

17:24.224 --> 17:27.194
Listen here, young lady.
You don't think I'm busy? I am.

17:27.194 --> 17:29.315
But not too busy
to find out where you live,

17:29.315 --> 17:31.985
your mother's maiden name,
and anything else it takes

17:31.985 --> 17:34.985
to make your life a living hell
if you don't put me through

17:34.985 --> 17:36.455
to that goddamn courier.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.165
I'll see if I can connect him.

17:43.035 --> 17:44.585
- Hello?
- Leroy.

17:44.585 --> 17:47.005
Thank God, it's you.
Yep. It's me, all right.

17:47.005 --> 17:49.125
I understand there is a problem.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.175
There sure is.

17:50.175 --> 17:51.465
I left a package for you

17:51.465 --> 17:52.845
this afternoon on my desk.

17:52.845 --> 17:54.965
I know you picked it up
because it's gone.

17:54.965 --> 17:57.055
Sorry, Gretchen.
It wasn't there.

17:57.055 --> 17:59.015
I waited around, like,
for 10 minutes.

17:59.015 --> 18:01.855
I asked the receptionist.
She didn't have it, so I left.

18:01.855 --> 18:06.185
Oh. Thank you, then, Leroy.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.525
Thank... Thanks for your time.

18:07.525 --> 18:10.025
Sorry to put you out.
No problem.

18:37.135 --> 18:38.725
Shit.

18:41.055 --> 18:43.725
Hello.
You must be Missy.

18:43.725 --> 18:46.025
That's right.
And you are?

18:46.025 --> 18:47.685
A friend of Sandy McClusky's.

18:47.685 --> 18:49.565
The woman who used to
cover this desk?

18:49.565 --> 18:51.655
I remember Sandy.
She trained me.

18:51.655 --> 18:53.405
Well, tried to, anyway.

18:53.405 --> 18:57.195
Sandy and I came up together
in the pool at Johnson Powell,

18:57.195 --> 18:59.155
along with Rebecca Hart
and Pat Nichols.

18:59.155 --> 19:00.615
We went through a lot together.

19:00.615 --> 19:02.705
How does that have
anything to do with me?

19:02.705 --> 19:04.785
Sandy owed me a favor
before she retired,

19:04.785 --> 19:06.205
and I need to call it in.

19:06.205 --> 19:08.625
So call her.
Well, she's in Coral Gables.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.545
You're the one on this desk now,
so the favor falls to you.

19:11.545 --> 19:14.965
I need you to log that you
received this yesterday.

19:18.015 --> 19:21.555
The problem with that is
I didn't receive it yesterday.

19:21.555 --> 19:24.395
It was an honest mistake.
Honest or not, it's yours.

19:24.395 --> 19:25.765
Why should I cover for you?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.145
Because Sandy owed me.

19:27.145 --> 19:29.065
That's how we
take care of each other.

19:29.065 --> 19:31.275
It's been going on
since before you were born.

19:31.275 --> 19:34.445
And your chance to cash in that
favor walked out when she did.

19:34.445 --> 19:36.865
Listen to me, young lady.
No, you listen to me.

19:36.865 --> 19:38.905
You're asking me
to lie to my boss,

19:38.905 --> 19:41.955
and I'm not gonna do it.
So instead of coming in here

19:41.955 --> 19:43.995
trying to get me
to put my ass on the line

19:43.995 --> 19:46.245
to honor
some 80-year-old tradition,

19:46.245 --> 19:49.125
why don't you not screw up
in the first place?

19:49.125 --> 19:52.425
You think you're hot shit,
and you don't need anyone.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.345
Well, one day, you're gonna be
in the position that I'm in,

19:55.345 --> 19:57.755
and you're gonna wish
like hell you had a network

19:57.755 --> 20:00.225
of people to call on for help.
Maybe I will.

20:00.225 --> 20:04.685
But something tells me by then,
you'll be long gone.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.945
Harvey Specter.

20:18.945 --> 20:20.655
Don't tell me.

20:20.655 --> 20:23.455
You're picking up the case
I had Samantha booted off of,

20:23.455 --> 20:25.875
and now I'm supposed to be
shaking with fear.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.625
You think I'd let you off
that easy, Eric? Not a chance.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.665
What?
There's an old saying.

20:30.665 --> 20:33.165
Accuse the other side
of that which you are guilty.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.045
Another old saying:
Get to the point.

20:35.045 --> 20:37.465
You said Samantha lied
about that billing sheet.

20:37.465 --> 20:40.005
Which got us thinking,
you lied about that sheet.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.805
Samantha never worked
for Grayscale.

20:41.805 --> 20:45.055
You say that again, and I will
have you sued for slander.

20:45.055 --> 20:46.765
I won't say it.
I'll just prove it.

20:46.765 --> 20:49.145
You gonna get me to admit
something I never did?

20:49.145 --> 20:52.065
No, Eric. I'll subpoena
every bill ever sent

20:52.065 --> 20:54.945
and every billing sheet
ever submitted by Samantha.

20:54.945 --> 20:58.025
When they don't add up, we won't
need this case to move forward

20:58.025 --> 21:01.445
because you'll be disbarred
for fabricated evidence.

21:01.445 --> 21:03.195
There's no way
I have to hand over

21:03.195 --> 21:05.415
proprietary records
to a competing firm.

21:05.415 --> 21:09.035
You really wanna take
that chance over one client?

21:09.035 --> 21:12.455
Let this go, Eric.
It's over.

21:12.455 --> 21:15.675
So it's not enough you had
to take my partner

21:15.675 --> 21:18.545
and half my business?
You have to come after the rest?

21:18.545 --> 21:20.305
I didn't come after anything.

21:20.305 --> 21:22.925
But as long as we're talking,

21:22.925 --> 21:25.885
I didn't take your partner.
You went behind his back

21:25.885 --> 21:27.845
to try to steal both our firms.

21:27.845 --> 21:30.515
If you think this little
sob story's gonna move me,

21:30.515 --> 21:33.065
you might as well pick up
a tissue, dab your eyes,

21:33.065 --> 21:34.565
and tell it somewhere else.

21:34.565 --> 21:36.985
And when you're finished,
you can call Grayscale

21:36.985 --> 21:39.695
and let them know
they're now represented by me.

21:48.535 --> 21:49.955
Gretchen.

21:49.955 --> 21:51.495
What brings you to my office?

21:51.495 --> 21:53.625
I need help.
Let me guess.

21:53.625 --> 21:56.165
You're coming to me because
you heard I fix things.

21:56.165 --> 21:58.755
I'm coming because
when Louis lost his mind on you,

21:58.755 --> 22:00.385
you didn't run to Robert.

22:00.385 --> 22:03.095
You went to Harvey because
you knew he needed a friend.

22:03.095 --> 22:05.425
And right now,
you need a friend.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.595
I screwed up big-time.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.475
Didn't send a document
that needed to be sent,

22:11.475 --> 22:14.185
and now Alex Williams
is gonna be in deep shit.

22:14.185 --> 22:15.985
Gretchen, I may be good,
but I can't

22:15.985 --> 22:18.735
travel back in time for you.
I know that.

22:18.735 --> 22:21.945
I asked that goddamn secretary
to cover for me,

22:21.945 --> 22:23.775
but she wouldn't honor the code.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.495
So you want me
to make it look like

22:25.495 --> 22:27.205
it's her fault and not yours.

22:27.205 --> 22:29.035
That's right.

22:30.205 --> 22:32.995
I'm sorry.
I... I can't do it.

22:32.995 --> 22:35.205
Is this because I told you
it could hurt Alex?

22:35.205 --> 22:36.955
This has nothing to do
with Alex.

22:36.955 --> 22:39.585
I'm telling you this
because what it would take

22:39.585 --> 22:42.845
to fix this thing could make it
a thousand times worse.

22:42.845 --> 22:46.055
And being your friend means
telling you it is not worth it.

22:46.055 --> 22:47.515
But Samantha...
No buts.

22:47.515 --> 22:49.765
You need to go to Alex
and tell him the truth.

22:49.765 --> 22:52.355
Because this is his client,
and he deserves to know.

22:58.275 --> 23:01.195
Louis, what are you doing?
You're missing dinner.

23:01.195 --> 23:03.655
It's sloppy joe night.
I'm not missing anything.

23:03.655 --> 23:05.285
I'm writing a contract.

23:05.285 --> 23:07.745
What? Is that your Civics
homework or something?

23:07.745 --> 23:09.995
No, Esther. It's
a legally binding document,

23:09.995 --> 23:12.535
stipulating that I'm required
to get even with Chaz

23:12.535 --> 23:14.495
by the end of the school year.

23:14.495 --> 23:16.625
Because he's putting you
in the locker.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.205
Yes, Esther, that's what I mean.

23:18.205 --> 23:20.675
Trust me, Louis.

23:20.675 --> 23:22.465
Whatever you're
thinking of doing,

23:22.465 --> 23:24.885
Chaz is just gonna
make your life worse.

23:24.885 --> 23:26.965
Like you know about
dealing with a bully.

23:26.965 --> 23:28.425
Believe me, I do.

23:28.425 --> 23:31.015
Remember when I dropped out
of band last year?

23:31.015 --> 23:32.895
When you told Mom
you couldn't stand

23:32.895 --> 23:34.145
being associated with me?

23:34.145 --> 23:35.975
What I couldn't stand

23:35.975 --> 23:38.485
was Carolyn Price
picking on me every day.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.025
I didn't know that.

23:40.025 --> 23:41.775
Well, now you do.

23:41.775 --> 23:43.695
So do you want my advice or not?

23:44.775 --> 23:46.325
I want it.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.575
Lay low, do what he wants,

23:48.575 --> 23:50.655
and hope he forgets
you ever existed.

23:50.655 --> 23:52.705
He's not going to forget,
and neither am I.

23:52.705 --> 23:54.375
Louis, don't you get it?

23:54.375 --> 23:57.335
Guys like Chaz always
get their way in high school.

23:57.335 --> 23:59.545
But high school ends.
And before you know it,

23:59.545 --> 24:02.255
you'll be successful,
and he'll be pumping your gas.

24:02.255 --> 24:04.755
Oh, my God, you're right.

24:04.755 --> 24:06.965
I'm not powerful enough
to face him now.

24:06.965 --> 24:08.305
But some day, I'll show him.

24:08.305 --> 24:10.015
No, Louis,
that's not what I meant.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.685
Now, excuse me. I need
to read over my contract.

24:19.775 --> 24:21.735
Carla, let me
call you right back.

24:21.735 --> 24:24.735
I think what we needed
just walked into my office.

24:24.735 --> 24:26.365
She still pissed?

24:26.365 --> 24:28.535
She won't be, once you
hand over that receipt.

24:28.535 --> 24:31.325
That's just it, Alex.
There isn't one.

24:31.325 --> 24:34.165
Come again? I never sent
the documents over.

24:34.165 --> 24:36.835
Are you shitting me? You're
coming to me with this now?

24:36.835 --> 24:38.875
I just realized last night
what happened.

24:38.875 --> 24:40.625
Why didn't you come
to me last night?

24:40.625 --> 24:41.955
I thought I could fix it.

24:41.955 --> 24:43.415
No, no.
Let's just review.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.755
After you gave me
bullshit about "Good morning.

24:45.755 --> 24:47.545
You look lovely,"
you lied to my face.

24:47.545 --> 24:50.515
It wasn't a lie. When I
found out, I tried to fix it.

24:50.515 --> 24:54.055
Well, you didn't. When Carla
finds out this was on me...

24:54.055 --> 24:57.185
It's my fault.
I'll take the bullet.

24:57.185 --> 24:58.895
Take the bullet?

24:58.895 --> 25:01.355
They're not gonna give a shit
whose fault this is.

25:01.355 --> 25:03.065
It's my client.
It's on my head.

25:03.065 --> 25:04.645
Is there anything I can do?

25:04.645 --> 25:07.155
Yeah. From now on, do what
you say you're gonna do.

25:07.155 --> 25:08.945
And if for some reason
you don't,

25:08.945 --> 25:11.695
at least have the courage to
tell me before it's too late.

25:17.205 --> 25:18.745
I know we demanded the client,

25:18.745 --> 25:20.995
but I never imagined
you'd hand-deliver them.

25:20.995 --> 25:23.795
The only thing I'm delivering,
Samantha, is an ultimatum.

25:23.795 --> 25:26.505
The thing about giving
ultimatums, Eric,

25:26.505 --> 25:28.385
is that you need to have
the upper hand.

25:28.385 --> 25:29.925
You don't.
I thought that too.

25:29.925 --> 25:31.845
Then I thought about
what Harvey said.

25:31.845 --> 25:34.675
Accuse the other side
of that which you are guilty.

25:34.675 --> 25:37.725
And I think
that's what you did to me.

25:37.725 --> 25:39.395
Sorry to disappoint you,

25:39.395 --> 25:41.855
but I have never fabricated
any evidence.

25:41.855 --> 25:44.485
No, but you buried some.
Corman Ventures.

25:44.485 --> 25:46.065
That was just a personal case

25:46.065 --> 25:47.775
I took care of
as a favor to Robert.

25:47.775 --> 25:49.565
I think you broke the law
to do it.

25:49.565 --> 25:51.575
You don't know what
you're talking about.

25:51.575 --> 25:53.325
Maybe not.
But Betty Palmer does.

25:54.325 --> 25:55.705
See, it always bothered me,

25:55.705 --> 25:57.535
the circumstances
around her leaving.

25:57.535 --> 25:59.665
So I decided to give her a call.
Bullshit.

25:59.665 --> 26:01.415
There's no way
she talked to you.

26:01.415 --> 26:04.045
Why don't you stroll down
to Coral Gables to find out?

26:04.045 --> 26:06.165
When you're finished,
if you don't want her

26:06.165 --> 26:08.045
telling the world
what she told me,

26:08.045 --> 26:10.045
you'll hand over
your oldest client.

26:10.045 --> 26:13.425
I'm not gonna just hand over
my oldest client to you.

26:13.425 --> 26:14.925
Well, I think you will.

26:14.925 --> 26:16.935
Because you put me
in front of a judge...

26:16.935 --> 26:19.475
"Your Honor, I didn't
fabricate anything.

26:19.475 --> 26:21.475
Someone must have made
a clerical error."

26:21.475 --> 26:23.395
She has got you dead to rights.

26:23.395 --> 26:26.355
No. It's her word
against mine.

26:26.355 --> 26:29.445
Well... Like Harvey said,
you know, you really wanna

26:29.445 --> 26:32.115
take that chance over
one piece of business?

26:32.115 --> 26:35.825
I'll expect my new client's
information by tomorrow.

26:44.095 --> 26:46.685
How are you doing, Louis?

26:46.685 --> 26:48.645
A little nervous.
You?

26:49.765 --> 26:52.025
A little nervous.

26:52.025 --> 26:53.985
Sheila. Louis.
Thank you for coming in.

26:53.985 --> 26:56.525
We're surprised you asked us
to come back so soon.

26:56.525 --> 26:58.445
Well, I didn't wanna
concern you, but...

26:58.445 --> 27:01.235
Oh, God. Is there something
wrong with my test results?

27:01.235 --> 27:02.695
It's nothing we can't handle.

27:02.695 --> 27:03.955
You have cervical fibroids

27:03.955 --> 27:05.825
that, unfortunately,
your OB missed.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.665
And I'd like to remove them.

27:07.665 --> 27:09.745
You... You mean like surgery?

27:09.745 --> 27:12.505
It's just a simple outpatient
laparoscopic procedure.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.965
I've done it hundreds of times.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.295
Okay, then,
I think we should do it.

27:16.295 --> 27:18.585
I'll set something up
in the next two weeks...

27:18.585 --> 27:19.845
Hold on a minute.

27:19.845 --> 27:21.715
Maybe we should get
a second opinion.

27:21.715 --> 27:23.635
You're welcome to get
a second opinion.

27:23.635 --> 27:25.885
But I think we should
schedule the surgery now.

27:25.885 --> 27:27.685
That way, we have it
on the books.

27:27.685 --> 27:30.395
For the record, this is my area
of expertise. I think that...

27:30.395 --> 27:32.185
If you know
what's good for you,

27:32.185 --> 27:34.185
you'll get in that locker.

27:34.185 --> 27:36.565
Litt, I could punch you
before you get in

27:36.565 --> 27:38.565
or you could just get in.

27:39.815 --> 27:41.325
Aren't you forgetting something?

27:55.505 --> 27:57.965
Well, Louis, what do you think
of that plan?

27:57.965 --> 28:00.595
I don't give a shit
what your area of expertise is.

28:00.595 --> 28:02.465
We're not gonna schedule
a goddamn thing

28:02.465 --> 28:05.595
with you now or ever.
And if you lay one hand

28:05.595 --> 28:07.435
on the woman I love,
I swear to God,

28:07.435 --> 28:09.095
I'll beat the shit out of you.

28:11.895 --> 28:14.395
Well, Louis...

28:14.395 --> 28:17.395
what do you think of that plan?

28:17.395 --> 28:20.485
I see no reason why
we need a second opinion.

28:20.485 --> 28:21.775
We'll do whatever you say.

28:21.775 --> 28:23.905
Great, then,
it's all settled.

28:29.665 --> 28:30.995
Hey, Samantha.

28:30.995 --> 28:33.165
Donna, whatever it is,
I'm kind of busy.

28:33.165 --> 28:35.335
I can see that.
Does it have to do

28:35.335 --> 28:38.335
with why you pushed three client
meetings at the last minute?

28:38.335 --> 28:40.585
I didn't realize you kept
tabs on my calendar.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.215
I don't.

28:42.215 --> 28:44.675
When those clients get
brushed off by their lawyer,

28:44.675 --> 28:46.425
I'm the one they call.
I told them

28:46.425 --> 28:47.845
those meetings will be back

28:47.845 --> 28:49.595
as soon as I'm back
from my trip.

28:49.595 --> 28:52.395
What trip? You haven't
submitted a travel request.

28:52.395 --> 28:55.225
And I won't be,
because this is personal.

28:55.225 --> 28:58.565
Okay, does this have to do with
Eric Kaldor coming here today?

28:58.565 --> 29:01.105
It has to do with me
needing to get down to Florida

29:01.105 --> 29:03.195
and you not telling anyone.
Samantha.

29:03.195 --> 29:05.075
Donna, just let me do what I do.

29:05.075 --> 29:06.735
Let me get this straight.

29:06.735 --> 29:09.035
You want me to keep something
from Harvey and Robert

29:09.035 --> 29:10.665
that might blow up
in their faces

29:10.665 --> 29:12.165
without telling me what it is?

29:12.165 --> 29:13.575
Yes. I do.

29:13.575 --> 29:14.995
I'm not sure I can do that.

29:14.995 --> 29:16.295
You know what, Donna?

29:16.295 --> 29:18.125
You wanna tell someone,
go ahead.

29:18.125 --> 29:20.505
Doesn't matter, 'cause
I'm getting on that plane.

29:20.505 --> 29:22.925
Okay, go ahead
and catch your plane.

29:22.925 --> 29:25.755
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

29:31.805 --> 29:34.765
Whatever you're up
to, it's not gonna happen.

29:34.765 --> 29:36.725
'Cause you're not getting
on that plane.

29:36.725 --> 29:38.985
Donna told you.
Damn right, Donna told me.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.355
I don't believe it.
She led me to think that I...

29:41.355 --> 29:43.945
When I asked you
if you fabricated evidence,

29:43.945 --> 29:45.905
you said you hadn't,
and I believed you.

29:45.905 --> 29:47.865
But now I think you have.
Harvey.

29:47.865 --> 29:49.535
I think you fabricated evidence,

29:49.535 --> 29:51.245
Kaldor is using it
to blackmail you,

29:51.245 --> 29:52.615
and you're about to head to

29:52.615 --> 29:54.245
wherever you're going
to stop it.

29:54.245 --> 29:56.585
Are you finished?
Am I right?

29:56.585 --> 29:57.995
I didn't lie to you.

29:57.995 --> 29:59.795
And I never fabricated evidence.

29:59.795 --> 30:01.915
What the hell's going on here?

30:03.755 --> 30:07.805
Five years ago,
we had a case. Criminal.

30:07.805 --> 30:09.555
One of our CEO's adult children

30:09.555 --> 30:11.515
was charged
with attempted murder.

30:11.515 --> 30:13.935
The pharmaceutical guy's daughter.
That's the one.

30:13.935 --> 30:17.435
And I did what it took
to get her out of it.

30:17.435 --> 30:19.065
And what exactly did it take?

30:19.065 --> 30:21.275
I buried evidence.

30:21.275 --> 30:22.945
I can't believe...
Before you say...

30:22.945 --> 30:24.405
You let a guilty woman off.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.405
She wasn't guilty,
and I know it.

30:26.405 --> 30:29.235
That's exactly what
my old mentor sounded like

30:29.235 --> 30:31.655
when it ended up
that he put away a man

30:31.655 --> 30:34.115
for a murder he didn't commit.
Well, I'm not him.

30:34.115 --> 30:36.705
I'm not gonna apologize
for doing what I had to.

30:36.705 --> 30:38.585
I don't give a shit
if you apologize.

30:38.585 --> 30:40.545
We're gonna fix this.
Damn right, we are.

30:40.545 --> 30:43.005
We're gonna fix it
by putting Betty Palmer on ice.

30:43.005 --> 30:44.375
Who the hell is Betty Palmer?

30:44.375 --> 30:46.465
The woman I got rid of
from Rand Kaldor

30:46.465 --> 30:49.095
who tried to stop me
from doing what I did.

30:49.095 --> 30:50.595
Eric found her.

30:50.595 --> 30:53.555
You know what?
I don't care who she is.

30:53.555 --> 30:56.095
We're gonna fix this
by you giving them your client.

30:56.095 --> 30:58.265
There is no way I am
giving one of my clients

30:58.265 --> 31:00.685
to the man who stabbed
Robert in the back.

31:00.685 --> 31:02.855
There's no way I'm letting you
do God knows what

31:02.855 --> 31:05.105
to a woman who tried to stop you
from breaking the law.

31:05.105 --> 31:06.735
Goddamn it. You...
That's enough!

31:06.735 --> 31:09.115
Give him your client now,
or I swear to God,

31:09.115 --> 31:11.445
I'll hand you in
for burying evidence myself.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.585
I wanted to say something,
to tell him I don't trust him,

31:20.585 --> 31:23.215
to tell him I hate him.
Anything.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.585
But I didn't.

31:25.585 --> 31:30.215
I just...
sat there... took it.

31:31.135 --> 31:32.765
Louis.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.225
I'd like to try
an exercise with you.

31:36.225 --> 31:38.225
What kind of exercise?

31:38.225 --> 31:40.105
Close your eyes.

31:41.395 --> 31:42.935
Now,

31:42.935 --> 31:46.275
imagine you are walking
down that hallway with Chaz

31:46.275 --> 31:47.815
to the locker.

31:47.815 --> 31:51.075
I don't want to.
Trust me.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.035
Just try it.

31:53.035 --> 31:57.745
And Louis, I'd like you
to envision yourself

31:57.745 --> 32:02.205
not as a young person,
but as you are now.

32:02.205 --> 32:05.085
So.

32:05.085 --> 32:07.215
Tell me what you see.

32:16.595 --> 32:18.595
It's horrible.

32:20.145 --> 32:22.775
I wanna stop walking,
but I can't.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.605
My legs just keep going.

32:24.605 --> 32:26.445
I see people looking.

32:28.315 --> 32:30.195
Some are laughing.

32:30.195 --> 32:31.825
Some don't give a shit.

32:33.575 --> 32:36.115
The worst are the ones
who pity me.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.545
We get to the gym.

32:43.545 --> 32:44.915
It's empty.

32:47.045 --> 32:49.755
We walk up
to the equipment locker.

32:51.045 --> 32:53.095
He opens the door.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.935
I can't stop my hand.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.145
I give him his homework.

33:02.145 --> 33:03.815
I don't wanna go in there,

33:03.815 --> 33:06.065
but I just don't have it in me
to fight anymore.

33:06.065 --> 33:08.605
Louis, I need you
to go into that locker.

33:08.605 --> 33:11.615
- I don't wanna.
- I know.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.945
Okay.

33:17.615 --> 33:20.365
Louis, one more thing.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.675
Okay, he's in
here with me now.

33:34.675 --> 33:37.635
Good. Now, what
would you like to say to him?

33:37.635 --> 33:39.515
- I don't know.
- Louis.

33:39.515 --> 33:41.435
I am telling you, I don't know.

33:41.435 --> 33:44.815
I do. You signed a contract with
me and you didn't live up to it.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.475
I wanted to. But I couldn't.
Why not?

33:47.475 --> 33:49.855
Because it's not just
about my feelings anymore.

33:49.855 --> 33:52.355
It's about Sheila,
our future, having a baby.

33:52.355 --> 33:54.985
What good is having a baby
if you can't protect it?

33:54.985 --> 33:57.235
That's not fair.
If I lashed out at Chaz,

33:57.235 --> 33:59.655
I'd ruin our chance
at having a child to protect.

33:59.655 --> 34:01.495
Bullshit.
That's just an excuse.

34:01.495 --> 34:04.205
You didn't say anything to Chaz
because you were afraid.

34:04.205 --> 34:06.245
That's not true.
You gave me your word.

34:06.245 --> 34:09.045
The word of a stupid teenager
that didn't understand.

34:09.045 --> 34:11.045
I grew up!
You didn't do anything

34:11.045 --> 34:13.255
except let him
humiliate us again.

34:13.255 --> 34:15.385
Like you swore
you would never do.

34:17.215 --> 34:18.844
You're right.

34:20.135 --> 34:21.804
I did.

34:24.225 --> 34:25.815
I was afraid.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.895
I'm still afraid.

34:29.895 --> 34:32.235
I'll always be afraid.
No, Louis, you won't.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.655
You don't have to be
afraid of Chaz anymore.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.405
Why not?

34:36.405 --> 34:38.824
Because I just remembered
another promise

34:38.824 --> 34:41.784
we made to ourselves when
we were all alone in here.

34:41.784 --> 34:43.364
You mean, if no one was looking,

34:43.364 --> 34:45.074
we should just start...
Not that one.

34:45.074 --> 34:46.784
Don't judge.
We were in here a long time.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.585
I mean, we were
in here in the dark,

34:48.585 --> 34:50.085
wondering if we'd ever get out.

34:50.085 --> 34:51.755
We started to cry.

34:51.755 --> 34:55.885
And we made a promise
to ourself that one day,

34:55.885 --> 34:59.175
if we ever have children,
we'd teach our son

34:59.175 --> 35:01.425
to treat people with respect

35:01.425 --> 35:04.645
and to never, ever be like Chaz.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.645
I'd forgotten that.
So did I.

35:07.645 --> 35:10.185
Until you just admitted
you were afraid too.

35:10.185 --> 35:14.445
If you don't mind, I'd like
to break that contract

35:14.445 --> 35:16.235
so I can keep that promise.

35:16.235 --> 35:18.695
I don't mind.
So it's a deal?

35:18.695 --> 35:20.155
Deal.

35:23.825 --> 35:25.745
Jesus, so this is
where it comes from.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.585
Hey, look at that.

35:31.375 --> 35:33.215
The door's open.

35:34.755 --> 35:37.045
Come on. What do you say
we get out of here?

35:47.895 --> 35:49.685
I don't know what to say, Stan.

35:51.265 --> 35:53.935
I never would have remembered
that promise without you.

35:53.935 --> 35:55.905
I just helped you see
that a part of you

35:55.905 --> 35:58.615
has always still been
in that locker.

35:58.615 --> 36:01.865
And what you needed was someone
to be in there with you.

36:01.865 --> 36:03.405
You mean you.
No, Louis.

36:03.405 --> 36:05.405
I mean you.

36:12.835 --> 36:14.215
Stop right there.

36:14.215 --> 36:16.375
I wanna take this in.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.585
Samantha Wheeler coming in
to kiss my ring.

36:18.585 --> 36:20.595
I'm not kissing shit.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.215
I'm coming to give you this.

36:23.215 --> 36:25.515
My ring or my ass,

36:25.515 --> 36:27.725
I don't care.
I win either way.

36:27.725 --> 36:29.605
No. Betty Palmer wins.

36:29.605 --> 36:32.105
She's the one who's gonna
represent this client.

36:32.105 --> 36:33.525
You wanna try that again?

36:33.525 --> 36:36.945
I said, Betty is the one
getting this client.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.315
And the only reason
I'm bringing their file here

36:39.315 --> 36:41.025
instead of to her office
is because

36:41.025 --> 36:43.905
I don't think the one
you gave her is big enough

36:43.905 --> 36:46.285
for someone who's about
to make Senior Partner.

36:46.285 --> 36:48.535
I don't think you quite
get how losing works.

36:48.535 --> 36:50.825
You see, you don't get
to dictate the terms...

36:50.825 --> 36:51.835
I didn't lose, Eric.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.245
I chose not to fight anymore.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.335
But I could change my mind.
Bullshit.

36:55.335 --> 36:58.875
You're trying to ease your guilt
about screwing over a woman

36:58.875 --> 37:00.715
who was trying
to do the right thing.

37:00.715 --> 37:02.255
You're right, I am.

37:02.255 --> 37:03.675
And you have no idea

37:03.675 --> 37:06.595
how much losing this client
is gonna cost me.

37:06.595 --> 37:08.685
But Betty does.

37:08.685 --> 37:12.055
Which means she'd be more than
happy to dig through your files

37:12.055 --> 37:14.435
and find my original
billing sheet.

37:14.435 --> 37:17.525
You know, the one that can get
you kicked out of the bar?

37:19.195 --> 37:21.905
Eric, you said
if I brought the client over,

37:21.905 --> 37:23.825
this would be over.
It's not my fault

37:23.825 --> 37:25.285
you're a shitty negotiator.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.495
So make Betty
a Senior Partner and move on,

37:27.495 --> 37:30.535
or this firm is gonna lose
another name off its wall.

37:30.535 --> 37:34.035
And this time, it'll be yours.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.635
Gretchen, can I
talk to you for a second?

37:41.635 --> 37:43.755
- Don't tell me.
- You were right.

37:43.755 --> 37:46.965
They did demand
that Alex fire you.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.055
He refused.

37:48.055 --> 37:49.595
No. Mm-mm.

37:50.765 --> 37:53.435
I can't let that happen.
What?

37:53.435 --> 37:56.935
I'm going to tell Robert
it was my fault. I'll retire.

37:56.935 --> 37:59.565
Maybe that'll save Alex his client.
What happened

37:59.565 --> 38:02.485
was as much my fault as yours.
Alex was right.

38:02.485 --> 38:04.405
I-I should've
followed up with Leroy.

38:04.405 --> 38:05.655
It was a simple mistake.

38:05.655 --> 38:08.245
And I should have
been able to fix it!

38:11.575 --> 38:14.335
I tried to call in
every favor I could.

38:15.585 --> 38:18.125
That woman laughed me
out of the office.

38:18.915 --> 38:20.465
And I always told myself

38:20.465 --> 38:23.545
when I ran out of juice,
I'd hang it up.

38:25.595 --> 38:29.345
Well, turns out
I'm squeezed dry.

38:31.385 --> 38:34.095
Gretchen, I can't tell you
when it's time.

38:35.645 --> 38:38.225
But I can tell you that
it took Mike going to prison

38:38.225 --> 38:40.935
for Harvey to learn that
some mistakes can't be fixed.

38:40.935 --> 38:42.695
And I'll tell you
something else.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.195
The night that Mike went away,

38:44.195 --> 38:46.075
Harvey thought about
hanging it up too.

38:46.075 --> 38:48.905
But if he tapped out, he
couldn't fight to get Mike out,

38:48.905 --> 38:50.365
and deep down, he knew

38:50.365 --> 38:52.745
that he still had
a lot of fight left in him.

38:53.955 --> 38:55.625
What if I don't?

38:55.625 --> 38:57.875
You wouldn't be telling me
this if you didn't.

38:57.875 --> 39:01.005
Because offering to retire
is just another way

39:01.005 --> 39:02.625
of fighting to fix it.

39:05.295 --> 39:08.255
How am I supposed to look
Alex in the eye tomorrow?

39:08.255 --> 39:10.265
You just do it.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.095
And it will be okay.

39:12.095 --> 39:14.725
Because someone who would
offer to pack it in for him

39:14.725 --> 39:16.435
doesn't come around very often.

39:16.435 --> 39:17.805
In fact, when he finds out,

39:17.805 --> 39:19.815
I bet he is in my office
bright and early,

39:19.815 --> 39:21.475
saying you should get a raise.

39:21.475 --> 39:23.695
You saying you're willing
to give me a raise?

39:23.695 --> 39:25.815
No. You just lost this firm
a huge client.

39:27.735 --> 39:29.195
Thanks, Red.

39:30.865 --> 39:33.655
I hope that when you're
thinking about packing it in,

39:33.655 --> 39:37.575
you have someone like you
to talk you out of it too.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.705
Gretchen.

39:41.665 --> 39:43.545
Get yourself on over here.

39:48.175 --> 39:49.545
Hey.

39:49.545 --> 39:51.305
Is it done?

39:51.305 --> 39:52.805
It's done.

39:54.385 --> 39:57.595
For what it's worth,
we threw some good punches.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.645
It just doesn't feel that way.

39:59.645 --> 40:02.105
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

40:02.105 --> 40:03.485
How's that?

40:03.485 --> 40:05.525
Because the next time
Kaldor comes around,

40:05.525 --> 40:07.565
you're gonna remember
how this felt.

40:09.405 --> 40:12.485
What do you say we hit the gym
and go a few rounds?

40:12.485 --> 40:14.955
Not tonight.
Why not?

40:14.955 --> 40:19.245
Because I'd feel bad that I lost
a client, and I'd let you win.

40:19.245 --> 40:21.795
And I don't wanna let you win.
You really think

40:21.795 --> 40:24.005
you can beat me, don't you?
I know I can.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.295
Isn't that what you thought
about Eric Kaldor?

40:26.295 --> 40:28.175
That's different,
and you know it.

40:29.585 --> 40:32.005
Let me tell you
something, Samantha.

40:32.005 --> 40:35.305
I never thought I could lose
until Mike Ross went to prison.

40:35.305 --> 40:38.145
I still don't ever think
I'm gonna lose.

40:38.145 --> 40:42.765
But I know in the back of
my mind that, one time, I did.

40:42.765 --> 40:45.145
It's just a thought.

40:46.025 --> 40:48.695
I'll keep that in mind.

40:48.695 --> 40:52.325
Goodnight, Harvey.
Goodnight, Samantha.

40:53.655 --> 40:55.745
Harvey.

40:55.745 --> 40:58.115
Just so you know,
if I had another chance

40:58.115 --> 41:00.915
to keep an innocent woman out
of prison, I'd do it again.

41:00.915 --> 41:04.165
That's between you
and your maker.

41:04.165 --> 41:06.255
But if there is a next time,

41:06.255 --> 41:09.625
how about you make sure
there aren't any Betty Palmers?

41:10.305 --> 41:16.506
