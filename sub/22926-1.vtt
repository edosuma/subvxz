00:00.876 --> 00:02.795
Go on about the wigmakers.

00:03.045 --> 00:03.921
I would. . . .

00:05.005 --> 00:07.341
I've gotta go have
my pacemaker checked.

00:07.549 --> 00:10.010
It's been so exciting talking to you.

00:10.636 --> 00:14.181
A: You don't have a pacemaker.
And B: I'll be back tomorrow.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.185
Tomorrow is promised to no one.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.773
Goodbye.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.863
Pacemaker, my ass.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:30.841 --> 01:32.676
Oh, Katie.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.388
You gotta start eating
better than this, darling.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.853
I'm having this
press conference here. . .

01:43.979 --> 01:47.024
. . .because it is here,
at this courthouse. . .

01:47.942 --> 01:51.403
. . .that Christine Sullivan's killer
will be tried.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.949
As you know, I came from
an impoverished family. . .

01:56.033 --> 01:58.327
...in an impoverished town.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.205
We lived with our doors...

02:01.580 --> 02:03.082
...unlocked.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.627
We all lock our doors now.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.588
-That's not what concerns me.
-A ginger ale.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.091
We are also locking our hearts.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.759
Could you turn that off?

02:13.968 --> 02:15.970
-That is the sadness.
-In a second.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.388
That. . .

02:17.638 --> 02:18.973
. . .is the loss.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.559
We are locking our hearts
to the weary.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.229
We are locking our hearts...

02:25.479 --> 02:27.898
... to the poor and their pain.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.234
Sisters and brothers...

02:30.484 --> 02:33.153
... we are locking our hearts
to ourselves.

02:37.741 --> 02:38.909
Turn it back on.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.494
-But you said--
-I know. . .

02:40.703 --> 02:41.704
. . .but turn it on.

02:46.667 --> 02:51.171
We feel that savagery and violence
must be allo wed a place at table.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.340
That is wrong.
That is not America.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.926
I shall fight that battle.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.720
Dear friend. . .

02:58.220 --> 02:59.805
. . .old friend. . .

03:02.933 --> 03:05.019
. . .we shall fight that battle.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.109
Who can explain chance?

03:13.444 --> 03:15.029
If we had not met. . .

03:15.279 --> 03:17.531
. . .I would not be President today.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.993
If Christine had not taken ill. . .

03:21.327 --> 03:24.204
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.541
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.

03:30.419 --> 03:34.214
I would give the world
to lessen your pain.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.941
Thank you.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.779
You heartless whore.

03:59.615 --> 04:02.159
I'm not about to run from you.

04:05.496 --> 04:09.375
Thomas Jefferson used
the Green Room as a dining room.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.794
The walls are covered
with green silk. . .

04:12.044 --> 04:14.922
. . .just as they were
when James Monroe was President.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.466
Many valuable objects
and paintings in this room.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.594
We'll move on to the Blue Room.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.015
James Hoban built
the Blue Room as an oval. . .

04:25.266 --> 04:27.601
. . .to please President Washington.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.771
During the holiday season. . .

04:31.021 --> 04:34.483
. . .the White House Christmas tree
stands in the middle.

04:34.733 --> 04:38.153
The view from the window
includes the Jefferson Memorial.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.739
We'll be moving on to the Red Room.

04:44.326 --> 04:48.372
The walls of the Red Room
are covered with red silk.

04:52.585 --> 04:56.088
He was in the building.
He took a guided tour.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.722
I've never dealt
with blackmail before.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.684
-He doesn't want money.
-You're a mind reader too now.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.395
No, I just looked on the back.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.314
See?

05:13.564 --> 05:15.357
"l don't want money. "

05:15.608 --> 05:18.319
He has the guts of a burglar.
Wish we had him.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.362
Finished your recruiting speech?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.700
Because I'd like to know
how I handle this.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.244
Like you handled the letter opener?

05:34.418 --> 05:36.003
Gee, Bill. . .

05:38.297 --> 05:41.884
. . .that could be construed
as criticism.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.846
You want me for an enemy?

05:46.305 --> 05:49.558
I should've called the police
that night but I was weak.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.561
You convinced me to stay silent.
I regret that.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.605
Know this:

05:55.230 --> 05:58.609
Every time I see your face,
I wanna rip your throat out.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.284
Fine.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.872
You win the pissing contest.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.469
What do I do?

06:25.678 --> 06:26.929
Nothing.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.641
He's making a mistake.
He thinks he has time. He doesn't.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.644
Seth Frank's too good.
He'll bring him in.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.562
Then what?

06:37.189 --> 06:38.315
Then I kill him.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.366
Miss Whitney?

06:47.616 --> 06:48.993
Thanks.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.129
Miss Whitney?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.716
I'm Seth Frank. Excuse me.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.141
Thanks.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.648
For a tough prosecutor, you sure
don't resemble your reputation.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.276
Is that good or bad?

07:26.572 --> 07:27.573
I don't know.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.786
Look, lieutenant,
I told you on the phone.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.458
I'm not involved with my father.
So this is a waste of time.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.920
Do you expect me to walk out of here?

07:43.380 --> 07:44.465
All right.

07:46.759 --> 07:48.010
All right.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.721
Your father disappeared.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.976
-I need your help.
-Look.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.479
Lieutenant, I don't know the man.

07:58.729 --> 08:02.858
He was in jail. When he got out,
my mom and I lived by ourselves.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.361
He doesn't care about me.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.613
I've seen him once this past year.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.281
Yeah, when?

08:10.616 --> 08:11.533
A few days ago.

08:13.327 --> 08:17.039
He said he might leave town.
I helped you. Can I work now?

08:18.207 --> 08:20.876
-Any idea where he went?
-Quit wasting my time.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.254
He doesn't want you to find him,
you won't.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.756
You're saying
he skipped the country?

08:25.965 --> 08:28.384
I'm saying you won't recognize him.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.303
He could be right around the corner.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.140
-He always had a safe house.
-Where?

08:35.349 --> 08:36.183
He never said.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.059
How do you know he had one?

08:39.812 --> 08:41.647
My mother loved him, all right?

08:41.855 --> 08:46.235
Even after she left him, when she was
dying, he was all she talked about.

08:47.278 --> 08:49.530
"lf only he hadn't done this.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.449
-If only he hadn't done that. "
-What else?

08:57.371 --> 08:59.665
-How long has he lived here?
-Years.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.208
Never been.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.757
This is a strange place
for a thief to leave a key.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.010
He always did that.

10:27.503 --> 10:31.924
He left in a hurry. I wonder what
scares a professional thief like that.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.896
He wasn't at these places.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.276
My college graduation. . .

10:51.777 --> 10:55.447
. . .my law school graduation,
the night my mother and l. . .

10:55.656 --> 10:59.868
. . .we went out to celebrate
because I'd gotten my first job.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.247
Me alone on the steps.
I'd won my first case.

11:07.126 --> 11:09.128
I used to think sometimes. . . .

11:13.507 --> 11:17.803
Sometimes I'd come home and could sense
that he'd been in the apartment.

11:18.178 --> 11:23.309
That he'd checked the fridge, shook
his head because I never ate right.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.439
I mean, I know it sounds crazy,
but I've always. . . .

11:29.023 --> 11:31.358
I've always felt
that he was around.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.403
You can do a good thing.
Help me bring him in.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.780
Leave a message
you're worried about him.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.282
No.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.410
It's true. You're worried.
This is no normal case.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.747
His life is in danger.
You call, you could save him.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.624
He won't come.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.293
Of course he'll come.
You're all he has.

11:49.752 --> 11:53.130
He's on the run and he's scared
because he'll get caught.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.091
-You don't know the heat.
-He's not a murderer.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.636
Maybe he is innocent.

11:59.178 --> 12:02.014
If that's true, I'll have him
home in a few hours.

12:03.974 --> 12:07.603
What if a hotshot trying to
make a reputation tracks him down?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.566
I can guarantee his safety.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.319
You make the call,
I'll make a promise.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.363
You'll have him back.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.300
-Seth Frank.
-Hi.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.428
I left a message on his machine.

12:41.679 --> 12:45.849
He called me back within the hour
and I'm meeting him tomorrow.

12:46.517 --> 12:47.643
Where?

12:49.228 --> 12:51.814
Open-air place near my office,
Cafe Alonzo.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.565
What time?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.818
Four o 'clock.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.737
It'll be deserted then.

13:00.281 --> 13:02.074
Sounds good. Thanks a lot.

13:02.283 --> 13:04.159
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.210
Dad, hi.

13:55.419 --> 13:57.546
It's Kate calling.

13:57.755 --> 14:01.759
I was wondering
if you could call me, please.

14:02.968 --> 14:06.931
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...

14:07.139 --> 14:10.601
...and maybe even get together,
if that's possible.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.144
Okay?

14:12.728 --> 14:15.898
Thanks and talk to you soon. Bye.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.528
Dad, hi.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.864
It's Kate calling.

14:24.114 --> 14:28.410
I was wondering
if you could call me, please.

14:29.328 --> 14:33.207
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...

14:33.457 --> 14:34.833
...and maybe even get together.

14:59.775 --> 15:03.279
So you all know where and when
you're supposed to be there.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.364
He's slippery. He's an eel.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.741
He gets a whiff of a cop,
he disappears.

15:07.992 --> 15:09.952
Nobody moves until I order you.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.037
Then we move in on him.

15:12.288 --> 15:16.750
Expect Whitney to show up at 4.
His daughter will be waiting for him.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.628
It's important to stay
in your positions. . .

15:19.878 --> 15:22.673
. . .until you hear the order
to move in on him.

15:55.331 --> 15:56.206
Here you go.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.125
Could I have some cream?

16:15.351 --> 16:17.478
Gather around, gentlemen.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.065
Nobody moves till
the suspect's in place.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.775
Any questions?

16:23.317 --> 16:25.194
See you at the Alonzo.

16:25.819 --> 16:26.862
Boss is grateful.

16:27.071 --> 16:29.615
He'd appreciate
an eyewitness at the capture.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.867
This is our guy.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.287
If he isn't, he sure disappeared fast.
See you there.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.749
Tums?

18:02.833 --> 18:04.251
I got my own.

18:25.773 --> 18:27.399
Come on, Kate.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.319
-She gonna show?
-Yeah, she'll be here.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.675
Miss?

20:17.676 --> 20:19.386
What you want, please?

20:20.429 --> 20:22.014
Nothing. Thank you.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.641
Got to.

20:24.683 --> 20:25.517
Pardon?

20:26.143 --> 20:28.062
You sit, you eat, please.

20:28.771 --> 20:32.107
Jeez, this guy wasn't part
of my master plan.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.234
Unbelievable.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.737
I'm waiting for someone.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.490
Oh, he must eat too, please.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.159
He will. We will.
We're gonna. . . .

20:42.409 --> 20:44.828
We'll order half the menu.
Just not now.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.876
Maybe that's him disguised
as a Chinaman.

21:47.558 --> 21:49.226
Check out this guy in the hat.

21:51.854 --> 21:54.064
I believe that's our man.

21:54.857 --> 21:57.234
All units, suspect's approaching.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.570
Stay in place.
Wait for my signal.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.547
I did not kill her.
I want you to believe that.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.970
Just hold on.
Let him get settled.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.683
You've gotta believe that.

22:32.937 --> 22:34.688
I think we're ready.

22:48.786 --> 22:49.620
Damn it!

23:20.401 --> 23:21.235
Almost.

23:28.617 --> 23:29.702
You okay?

23:30.035 --> 23:31.495
What was that?

23:32.997 --> 23:34.832
Anyone see where those came from?

23:35.082 --> 23:37.626
-Did you do that?
-No, we didn't do it!

23:37.876 --> 23:39.795
Anyone see where
those shots came from?

23:43.382 --> 23:44.592
Where's Whitney?

23:44.800 --> 23:47.511
Quit standing around here!
Go find him!

23:55.060 --> 23:55.894
Take it easy.

23:56.145 --> 23:57.438
Take it easy.

23:57.688 --> 24:00.274
Take it easy, now.
Stay calm. Stay calm.

24:00.524 --> 24:02.526
There's no reason to panic.

24:02.818 --> 24:05.863
If everyone will just
kindly take it easy.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.012
Messy.

24:30.471 --> 24:32.139
I like that in a woman.

24:35.351 --> 24:36.518
Here.

24:40.773 --> 24:42.775
I got a few numbers here.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.069
The top one's. . .

24:45.778 --> 24:48.864
. . .local police. That's
my office, my home, beeper.

24:49.740 --> 24:52.493
I live alone too.
You can call anytime.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.331
Want me to get
someone to stay here?

24:58.666 --> 25:01.168
No, I wanna get some sleep.

25:01.418 --> 25:03.671
Surveillance is outside
until it's over.

25:03.921 --> 25:06.298
I've got a feeling he'll contact you.

25:07.466 --> 25:09.385
You're on a hot streak, I guess.

25:10.803 --> 25:12.596
Listen, I'm sorry.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.811
Anything unusual at all. . .

25:19.270 --> 25:20.938
. . .call right away.

25:21.188 --> 25:22.690
It's not a bother.

25:24.775 --> 25:26.068
I live alone.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.697
You said.

25:31.115 --> 25:32.616
Feeble.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.330
You want something for the road?

25:40.291 --> 25:42.001
I got water and water.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.212
Deal.

26:00.853 --> 26:02.855
A Pellegrino would be great.

26:04.982 --> 26:07.234
What's so funny?
I say it wrong?

26:08.777 --> 26:10.571
I'm tired.

26:11.447 --> 26:13.073
I'm just tired.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.377
Listen. . .

26:25.586 --> 26:27.254
. . .there's one thing. . .

26:28.130 --> 26:29.965
. . .I forgot to tell you.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.719
I live alone.

26:38.974 --> 26:40.434
Lock up behind me.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.691
-How's that?
-Real good.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.777
Now get some sleep.

26:50.486 --> 26:52.071
Thank you.

26:59.745 --> 27:02.706
I betrayed you twice, Luther.
You should know that.

27:02.998 --> 27:04.792
You're not the first.

27:12.049 --> 27:13.342
Why'd you come?

27:14.218 --> 27:16.845
I can't have my daughter
thinking I was a murderer.

27:19.807 --> 27:23.143
No, I mean this afternoon.
Why'd you come?

27:23.394 --> 27:26.188
You suspected something
or you wouldn't have prepared.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.565
My daughter wanted to see me.

27:34.571 --> 27:37.741
The robbery was going fine
until they came in.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.451
They were drunk.

27:39.702 --> 27:41.912
I was hidden in the vault.

27:42.121 --> 27:44.456
And the sex had started
getting rough. . .

27:44.665 --> 27:46.709
. . .and he started beating her. . .

27:47.001 --> 27:49.878
. . .started strangling her.
I thought he'd kill her.

27:50.129 --> 27:54.008
Then she somehow got the upper hand.

27:54.466 --> 27:58.470
She was gonna stab him with
a letter opener and two guys shot her.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.974
The same two guys
who tried for you today.

28:03.601 --> 28:04.852
Possibly.

28:05.102 --> 28:07.438
Unless Walter Sullivan
was taking a shot.

28:09.773 --> 28:11.775
It's a pretty powerful enemy.

28:12.026 --> 28:13.819
That's very good going.

28:15.529 --> 28:18.490
Not as powerful as
the President of the United States.

28:20.659 --> 28:21.785
That's right.

28:22.036 --> 28:24.371
Alan Richmond, he was the drunk.

28:25.247 --> 28:27.166
The two guys were Secret Service.

28:27.416 --> 28:30.127
Chief of Staff Russell
handled the cover-up.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.631
Well, then you go to the police.

28:33.923 --> 28:36.967
That's what innocent people do.
They go to the police.

28:37.176 --> 28:38.636
Sure.

28:38.844 --> 28:40.554
That young man who was here. . .

28:40.804 --> 28:43.432
. . .he'd believe me
over the President, right?

28:44.850 --> 28:46.435
Why should I believe you?

28:48.228 --> 28:50.314
Because I swear to you, Kate.

28:50.773 --> 28:52.733
I swear to you on Mattie's grave.

28:54.068 --> 28:55.110
That's right.

28:55.569 --> 28:59.490
Your mother's grave. I'd kill myself
before I'd lie about that.

29:01.325 --> 29:03.035
Oh, Jesus, Luther.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.329
-Yeah. I know.
-They'll kill you.

29:07.831 --> 29:10.542
-I know.
-Can you run?

29:12.294 --> 29:15.965
I was all set to.
I was at the airport ready to go.

29:16.799 --> 29:18.884
Then there was that press conference.

29:19.885 --> 29:23.472
And there was Richmond
using old man Sullivan.

29:25.516 --> 29:28.060
You know, I might not
have been able to. . .

29:28.310 --> 29:30.771
. . .save Christy Sullivan. . .

29:31.689 --> 29:33.357
. . .but I didn't even try.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.610
What are you gonna do?

29:40.030 --> 29:42.074
I'll think of something.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.961
I watched you argue a case last year.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.212
You won it.

29:56.505 --> 29:59.008
Thank God you got
your mother's brains.

30:00.426 --> 30:01.635
Dangerous outside.

30:04.179 --> 30:05.973
It always is.

30:27.953 --> 30:29.580
Excuse me.

30:29.997 --> 30:32.166
Could you give this
to Gloria Russell?

30:32.416 --> 30:36.253
-Anything for me to sign?
-No, you have an honest face.

31:15.501 --> 31:17.336
Oh, my God.

31:39.525 --> 31:41.151
You're a vision tonight.

31:41.610 --> 31:44.655
Thank you, Mr. President.

31:45.155 --> 31:47.658
And thank you, Mr. President.

31:47.866 --> 31:50.286
For. . .?
Come again.

31:56.041 --> 31:56.875
You know.

32:01.213 --> 32:04.049
You sent it to me this afternoon.

32:05.384 --> 32:06.760
Of course.

32:09.138 --> 32:11.807
Would you excuse me, all?

32:12.057 --> 32:15.728
I'm overcome with a desire
to dance with my chief of staff.

32:16.395 --> 32:18.647
Look after this for me, would you?

32:40.920 --> 32:42.838
What is this nonsense?

32:43.130 --> 32:45.132
I'm hoping there's an explanation.

32:45.799 --> 32:48.385
Your gift, Alan. I was. . .

32:48.636 --> 32:50.137
. . .overwhelmed.

32:50.387 --> 32:53.891
And, you know, your note
was so gratifying.

32:59.188 --> 33:00.439
I sent a note?

33:01.273 --> 33:03.108
Yes, yes.

33:03.359 --> 33:05.653
You think I don't know your writing?

33:05.903 --> 33:08.739
I assumed you wanted me
to wear it tonight.

33:09.156 --> 33:11.825
-Gloria, it's lovely.
-Yes.

33:12.034 --> 33:13.702
And you know what else?

33:14.954 --> 33:16.205
What, Alan?

33:18.582 --> 33:21.126
Christy wore it the night
she was killed.

33:28.968 --> 33:30.219
Know what this means?

33:30.427 --> 33:31.679
No.

33:31.929 --> 33:33.722
Whitney's been heard from.

33:41.313 --> 33:43.899
It's not precisely the first time.

33:47.736 --> 33:49.822
You been keeping things from me?

33:51.824 --> 33:55.661
Well, it's just that you have
so much on your plate.

33:55.911 --> 33:57.955
We wanted to spare you.

34:02.334 --> 34:04.920
He sent me a Polaroid. . .

34:05.170 --> 34:07.506
. . .of the letter opener yesterday.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.649
I have to give this some thought.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.906
Come to my office in the morning.

34:33.032 --> 34:36.076
This'll make an interesting
chapter in my memoirs.

34:50.257 --> 34:52.467
Do we know who the forger is?

34:52.717 --> 34:56.931
I talked to Seth Frank. Apparently,
Whitney learned how in prison.

35:00.559 --> 35:02.144
A gifted man.

35:03.896 --> 35:05.397
How close are we to him?

35:06.148 --> 35:08.150
We're working around the clock.

35:10.069 --> 35:11.946
Well, that's good to know.

35:13.113 --> 35:14.448
He'll make a mistake.

35:15.241 --> 35:17.159
Well, that's good to know too.

35:25.042 --> 35:26.293
There is. . .

35:26.502 --> 35:28.420
. . .one other thing. . .

35:29.213 --> 35:31.131
. . .that we need to take care of.

35:33.717 --> 35:35.719
He has a daughter, doesn't he?

35:37.638 --> 35:39.223
You sure you wanna do that?

35:41.934 --> 35:43.185
Sir?

35:48.065 --> 35:52.069
She's a young prosecutor.
Prosecutors ask questions.

35:54.363 --> 35:56.532
Maybe she knows what he knows.

36:01.662 --> 36:03.247
Let's get cracking, boys.

36:07.293 --> 36:09.420
Show that you love your country.

36:34.236 --> 36:35.696
How's Kate doing?

36:36.113 --> 36:37.197
Where are you?

36:37.406 --> 36:40.117
I won't hang around for you
to trace the call.

36:40.326 --> 36:41.744
Just answer the question.

36:42.119 --> 36:44.246
She couldn't be in better hands.

36:44.455 --> 36:47.791
Secret Service is
taking over surveillance.

36:51.337 --> 36:52.588
Hello?

36:56.216 --> 36:57.593
Hello?

40:08.242 --> 40:10.077
It's entered in the chart.

40:10.995 --> 40:14.248
We upped her from
250 to 500 milligrams.

40:55.706 --> 40:58.042
Nurse, I need you right away, please.

40:58.626 --> 41:00.127
He's having a seizure.

42:05.234 --> 42:07.903
Dr. Kevorkian, I presume.

42:09.029 --> 42:12.908
My guess is that this is right
in your carotid artery about now.

42:13.826 --> 42:16.078
You're gonna get a little woozy.

42:16.537 --> 42:18.372
But if I give you the rest. . .

42:18.622 --> 42:21.875
. . .it'll fry your brain down
to the size of a peanut.

42:22.293 --> 42:23.544
Drop that.

42:38.642 --> 42:40.019
Luther. . .

42:41.061 --> 42:42.396
. . .he was my President.

42:43.314 --> 42:45.024
Right or wrong.

42:46.150 --> 42:47.985
Well, he made a mistake.

42:48.193 --> 42:49.570
You made a mistake.

42:52.323 --> 42:55.868
When you went after my girl,
that was entirely unacceptable.

42:58.579 --> 42:59.663
Mercy.

43:02.833 --> 43:04.251
I'm fresh out.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.804
Daddy?

43:19.642 --> 43:21.185
Go to sleep, darling.

43:53.175 --> 43:54.885
Oh, Jesus!

43:57.054 --> 43:58.555
Just one question.

43:58.806 --> 44:02.768
Did Walter Sullivan say
why Christy didn't go to Barbados?

44:03.811 --> 44:05.938
Just that she changed her mind.

44:06.855 --> 44:08.816
You know who did it, don't you?

44:10.693 --> 44:13.654
So will you.
Check your phones.

44:19.702 --> 44:21.370
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.

44:42.391 --> 44:44.476
You're taking a shortcut, Tommy?

44:47.855 --> 44:50.566
I'm your substitute driver tonight.

44:52.109 --> 44:54.278
Don't worry about Tommy.
He's fine.

44:54.987 --> 44:56.822
Very unusual.

44:57.615 --> 44:59.325
What do I call you?

45:00.242 --> 45:01.827
Luther, sir.

45:03.329 --> 45:06.957
And are you familiar with
how to get to my townhouse, Luther?

45:07.207 --> 45:08.918
Oh, yes, sir.

45:09.126 --> 45:11.170
I know where all your houses are.

45:11.378 --> 45:13.505
I'm the man who robbed you.

45:16.926 --> 45:19.261
You're the man who tried to kill me.

45:21.221 --> 45:23.515
I'm sorry I missed.

45:24.934 --> 45:27.686
I believe in the Old Testament, sir.

45:28.187 --> 45:30.648
There's nothing wrong with
an eye for an eye. . .

45:30.898 --> 45:32.608
. . .when a terrible deed is done.

45:33.442 --> 45:35.611
A deed such as yours.

45:36.487 --> 45:38.322
You'd like to believe that.

45:38.530 --> 45:41.033
That'd be simple for you
to believe that.

45:41.242 --> 45:43.535
What do I have to gain by being here?

45:44.370 --> 45:45.871
I have no idea.

45:46.121 --> 45:47.748
You going to rob me again?

45:48.123 --> 45:50.459
I don't need your money, Mr. Sullivan.

45:50.709 --> 45:53.128
Did you check your vault lately?

45:53.796 --> 45:55.839
I put everything back.

45:57.383 --> 46:00.844
I'm afraid we're a little late
for an attempt at leniency.

46:05.099 --> 46:07.518
A lot of crap's coming
down tonight, sir.

46:07.726 --> 46:09.436
You wanna be a player or not?

46:09.687 --> 46:12.231
You wanna know what happened
or don't you?

46:12.439 --> 46:14.191
Because I was there.

46:14.817 --> 46:16.235
I want to know.

46:16.860 --> 46:19.238
You think you can stand
hearing about it?

46:19.488 --> 46:21.824
How he beat her,
tried to strangle her?

46:22.074 --> 46:23.784
You really wanna know?

46:25.035 --> 46:27.580
I could walk through fire.

46:29.164 --> 46:31.292
I was in the vault when they came in.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.168
They were drunk.

46:33.377 --> 46:34.795
He knocked her around.

46:35.004 --> 46:36.922
She fought back.

46:37.631 --> 46:39.008
He got really rough.

46:39.258 --> 46:41.302
She tried to defend herself.

46:41.510 --> 46:43.387
Well, he started screaming. . .

46:43.596 --> 46:46.265
. . .sniveling simp he is.

46:46.473 --> 46:48.100
Who else was in my house?

46:48.309 --> 46:51.020
Secret Service.
They're the ones who shot her.

46:51.812 --> 46:52.855
Nonsense.

46:53.647 --> 46:55.816
Gloria Russell handled the cover-up.

46:56.025 --> 46:57.109
Stop this!

46:57.568 --> 46:59.194
You wanna know who it was?

46:59.403 --> 47:00.571
It was you.

47:01.071 --> 47:04.825
Come on, Mr. Sullivan.
We're too old to bullshit each other.

47:05.451 --> 47:06.660
Who was it, then?

47:06.869 --> 47:08.370
You know.

47:11.123 --> 47:12.541
Don't shake your head.

47:16.420 --> 47:19.715
When you're alone and rage takes over
and you want revenge. . .

47:19.965 --> 47:22.384
. . .what face do you put
with your enemy?

47:36.315 --> 47:37.691
Stop the car!

47:37.900 --> 47:39.568
We're going straight ahead.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.364
This is too terrible.

47:43.614 --> 47:45.324
Yes, it is.

47:47.076 --> 47:51.789
I know about Alan's reputation
as a philanderer. . .

47:52.456 --> 47:54.833
. . .but he'd never dream
of betraying me.

47:57.586 --> 48:00.130
I gave him the Presidency.

48:00.923 --> 48:02.549
Remember that press conference?

48:02.800 --> 48:05.177
Where he put his arm
around you and said. . .

48:05.427 --> 48:09.306
. . .if Christy hadn't been sick,
she'd have been in Barbados with you?

48:09.515 --> 48:11.850
How the hell did he know
she was sick?

48:12.685 --> 48:14.353
You didn't tell anyone.

48:14.603 --> 48:16.814
It's because she told him that night.

48:17.064 --> 48:19.149
I was right there watching.

48:20.442 --> 48:22.444
That's not real proof.

48:24.738 --> 48:26.365
Well, maybe this is, then.

48:32.496 --> 48:34.081
You could've stolen this.

48:35.541 --> 48:36.875
I did steal it.

48:37.126 --> 48:40.588
But that's not my blood on there
and that's not my prints.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.992
Mr. Sullivan.

49:25.799 --> 49:28.385
I did love her, you know.

49:49.198 --> 49:51.075
Jeez, Burton.

50:37.663 --> 50:41.542
Is he working late? I don't have
an appointment but I want to see him.

50:41.792 --> 50:44.044
You don't need an appointment.

50:57.057 --> 50:58.392
Let's go, Miss Russell.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.436
Walter.

51:42.728 --> 51:43.562
Come in.

51:47.900 --> 51:50.402
We interrupt with a breaking story...

51:50.653 --> 51:52.905
... that's shocking
the nation and the world.

51:53.155 --> 51:57.660
Information just came from the White
House about a tragedy within the hour.

51:57.868 --> 51:59.787
We go now to our correspondent.

52:00.037 --> 52:01.872
Diane, what can you tell us?

52:03.874 --> 52:08.921
Sources tell us Walter Sullivan
had seen President Richmond tonight.

52:09.129 --> 52:12.258
That was for an unscheduled
private meeting.

52:22.726 --> 52:24.561
You're still here.

52:27.565 --> 52:28.899
I'm still here.

52:39.159 --> 52:41.245
--I would not be President.

52:42.788 --> 52:45.833
If Christine had not taken ill. ..

52:46.500 --> 52:49.169
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

52:52.881 --> 52:55.676
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.

52:55.926 --> 52:58.512
This is the President's
most recent news conference...

52:58.721 --> 53:00.556
... where he clearly outlined...

53:00.764 --> 53:03.559
...his loyalty to philanthropist
and friend, Sullivan.

53:03.767 --> 53:06.895
The President vowed to find
Sullivan 's wife 's killer.

53:07.146 --> 53:11.275
Sullivan had a meeting with the
President. Unknown what they discussed.

53:11.525 --> 53:13.903
Now to the White House
for a live interview.

53:14.361 --> 53:18.490
Have you no idea why the President
would take his own life?

53:19.450 --> 53:24.204
I know he's been feeling the pressure
of office, more than ever, lately.

53:24.705 --> 53:26.749
He talked about it a great deal.

53:26.999 --> 53:29.043
But why would he stab himself?

53:32.671 --> 53:35.466
That's a question that will
haunt me forever.

53:38.469 --> 53:41.555
Of course I tried to stop him.

53:43.349 --> 53:44.475
Alan...

53:44.725 --> 53:46.518
... was like a son to me.

54:31.021 --> 54:32.815
Was that Seth?

54:35.985 --> 54:39.446
I think he'd like to come over
for supper when you get well.

54:46.370 --> 54:48.247
You don't have to fuss.

54:48.455 --> 54:49.707
I know.

54:56.005 --> 54:57.673
Am I gonna be all right?

54:59.258 --> 55:00.551
Yeah.

55:01.677 --> 55:03.804
We're gonna be just fine.
