00:57.640 --> 00:59.433
All right, give me room. Here we go.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.991
- What's this game called?
- This is Lightcycle.

01:32.842 --> 01:33.842
Damn!

01:50.735 --> 01:54.905
You're getting brutal, Sark.
Brutal and needlessly sadistic.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.241
Thank you, Master Control.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.410
We've kidnapped
some military programs.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.956
I can arrange more lethal matches.
Interested?

02:04.040 --> 02:07.668
Sure. I'd love to go up against
one of those guys.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.753
Make a nice break from those
accounting cream puffs

02:10.839 --> 02:12.589
you keep sending me.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.510
- What branch of the service?
- Strategic Air Command.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.679
Nice.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.641
Hey, look. This is all a mistake.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.227
I'm just a compound interest program.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.981
I work at a savings and loan.
I can't play these video games.

02:29.065 --> 02:32.484
Sure, you can, pal. You look like
a natural athlete if I ever saw one.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.278
Who me? Are you kidding? No.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.364
I run out to check on T-bill rates,
I get out of breath.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.617
Hey, look, you guys are gonna make
my user, Mr Henderson, very angry.

02:40.702 --> 02:44.496
- He's a full branch manager.
- Great. Another religious nut.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.087
I'd say, "Welcome, friend,"
but not here, not like this.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.298
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.971
- Do you believe in the users?
- Yeah, sure.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.599
If I don't have a user,
then who wrote me?

03:03.683 --> 03:05.142
That's what you're doing here.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.060
Master Control Program's
been snapping up

03:07.145 --> 03:09.313
all us programs who believe.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.480
If he thinks you're useful,

03:10.565 --> 03:12.608
he takes over all your functions
so he gets bigger,

03:12.734 --> 03:14.943
and if he can't use you, he sends you
down here to the game grid

03:15.028 --> 03:16.695
to get the bits blasted out of you.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.573
- What's your name?
- Crom.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.575
I'm Ram.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.286
They'll train you for the games, but...

03:26.581 --> 03:28.248
I hope you make it.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.919
Hey, what's been going on
in the other sectors?

03:32.003 --> 03:34.880
You know, I've been stuck here
for 200 microcycles.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.344
It's murder out there. You can't even
travel around your own microcircuits

03:40.428 --> 03:43.764
without permission
from Master Control Program.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.017
I mean, sending me down here
to play games.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.977
Who does he calculate he is?

03:55.318 --> 03:58.779
Okay, Clu, tonight we check
everything in the right-hand column.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.867
Come on. Come on.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.244
Where are you?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.870
- There you are. Clu.
- Yes, sir?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.538
Clu, we don't have much time left
to find that file.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.540
- This is top priority.
- Yes, sir. I know, sir.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.917
This isn't just correcting
my bank statement

04:12.001 --> 04:13.752
or phone bill problem again.
This is a must.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.879
- I understand, sir. Yes, sir.
- Now, I wrote you.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.547
I taught you everything
I know about the system.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.589
Thank you, sir.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.425
- But I'm not sure...
- No "buts," Clu. That's for users.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.552
Now you're the best program
that's ever been written.

04:22.637 --> 04:23.887
You're dogged and relentless,
remember?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.597
- Let me at 'em.
- That's the spirit.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.182
Now keep that tank rolling.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.977
I'll try to cover you from this end. Go.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.998
Do you think we can merge
with this memory, Bit?

04:52.333 --> 04:53.333
Yes.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.510
Now Flynn is saying
to look over in here,

05:03.720 --> 05:05.512
but I don't see what we're looking for.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.856
Come on, you scuzzy data. Be in there.
Come on.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.616
We've got company.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.373
I don't believe this.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.210
- A Recogniser.
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

05:48.890 --> 05:50.223
There's too many of them!

06:12.413 --> 06:13.872
What is this?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.099
Damn it!

06:37.230 --> 06:40.273
- Get out of here!
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

06:53.955 --> 06:55.372
Busted again.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.750
God. And that was my best program.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.681
Got a pirate program here.
Says his name's Clu.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.225
What did he pull?

07:15.309 --> 07:18.186
Came into the system
with a stolen password

07:18.354 --> 07:21.398
and we caught him trying to raid
a high-clearance memory.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.985
No. I must've gotten in there
by mistake. I was...

07:25.069 --> 07:27.654
- Who programmed you?
- I was...

07:36.247 --> 07:39.332
You're in trouble, program.
Make it easy on yourself.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.959
Who's your user?

07:41.043 --> 07:44.254
Forget it,
mister high-and-mighty Master Control!

07:46.799 --> 07:48.800
You aren't making me talk.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.596
Suit yourself.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.444
Get me Dillinger.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.125
- Good evening, Mr Dillinger.
- Thank you, Peter. You can go now.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.460
Yes, sir.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.610
Hello, Mr Dillinger.
Thanks for coming back early.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.113
No problem, Master C.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.783
If you've seen one consumer electronic
show, you've seen them all. What's up?

09:37.076 --> 09:40.537
It's your friend, the boy detective.
He's nosing around again.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.664
- Flynn?
- Yes.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.042
- It felt like Flynn.
- He's still looking for that old file.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.795
- Can't you just appropriate it?
- I have.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.048
I put it in my memory,
which he hasn't located.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.843
- But he might find it.
- I'm afraid so.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.887
I spotted him this time
and kept him out.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.557
But he's getting trickier all the time.

10:01.309 --> 10:06.062
I think we should shut down all access
until we find that Flynn, just to be safe.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.649
There's a 68.71% chance you're right.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.193
- Cute.
- End of line.

10:40.306 --> 10:44.184
"Your access suspended"?
"Report to Dillinger"? Come on.

10:45.227 --> 10:48.772
Hey, Alan? You think I could
have some of your popcorn?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.398
Yeah, sure.

10:52.526 --> 10:55.070
I don't know what he'd want
to see me for. What did I do?

11:21.472 --> 11:23.723
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

11:29.063 --> 11:33.274
We've had to shut down all Group 7
personnel, just briefly. Security.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.610
Someone with that access
has been tampering.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.237
Well, I hope you don't think it's me.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.989
I don't even balance my chequebook
on downtime.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.741
I have an abacus at home for that.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.869
Yes, I'm sure. You understand.
It should only be a couple of days.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.913
What's the project you're working on?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.915
Well, it's called Tron.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.334
It's a security program itself, actually.

11:51.419 --> 11:55.171
It monitors all contacts
between our system and other systems.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.258
Finds anything going on that's
not scheduled, it shuts it down.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.929
- I sent you a memo on it.
- Part of the Master Control Program?

12:03.139 --> 12:06.474
No. No, it'll... It'll run independently

12:06.559 --> 12:08.476
and watchdog the MCP as well.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.770
Sounds good.

12:11.856 --> 12:16.025
Well, we should have you running
again in a couple of days, I hope.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.778
Okay.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.823
Thanks.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.297
Oh, boy.

12:37.381 --> 12:40.717
Mr Dillinger,
I'm so very disappointed in you.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.720
- I'm sorry.
- I can't afford

12:43.804 --> 12:46.890
to have an independent programmer
monitoring me.

12:46.974 --> 12:50.226
Do you realise how many
outside systems I've gone into?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.896
How many programs
I've appropriated?

12:53.355 --> 12:54.856
Come on.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.359
Couple of days!

13:50.579 --> 13:54.290
- Well, here goes nothing.
- Yeah. Interesting. Interesting.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.377
Did you hear what you just said?
"Here goes nothing."

13:57.461 --> 13:59.379
- Well, what I meant was...
- Actually, what we propose to do

13:59.463 --> 14:02.632
is to change something
into nothing and back again.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.301
Then you might just as well
have said, "Here goes something.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.971
- "Here comes nothing."
- Right.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.056
Let's clear the area.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.062
Yeah. This is the big moment.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.898
I know this'll nail down your theory
that the scanned UV beam

14:18.983 --> 14:21.776
is superior to that
single-pulse exposure.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.571
Laser activity will exist in 30 seconds.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.365
Put on your goggles.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.910
- Leave the bank in your own...
- Let's see if we got the green light.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.912
Is the target area sufficiently shielded?

14:32.997 --> 14:36.207
- Yeah, they verified the safety...
- Twenty seconds.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.960
- Looks good.
- Let her rip.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.337
- Fifteen seconds.
- This is what we've been waiting for.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.425
Ten seconds.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.096
Five seconds.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.573
Perfect.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.951
- Congratulations.
- Beautiful.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.537
- Hi, Alan.
- You two having fun

15:14.622 --> 15:17.206
- disintegrating things down here?
- Not disintegrating, Alan.

15:17.291 --> 15:22.545
Digitising. A laser dismantles
the molecular structure of the object,

15:22.630 --> 15:25.882
and molecules remain
suspended in the laser beam.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.343
Then, when the computer
plays out the model,

15:28.427 --> 15:31.721
the molecules fall back
into place and voilà!

15:31.805 --> 15:34.349
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?

15:34.433 --> 15:38.227
Yeah, but you gotta purchase
your program 30 days in advance.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.189
How's it going upstairs?

15:41.398 --> 15:42.815
Frustrating.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.361
I had Tron almost ready
when Dillinger cut everyone

15:46.445 --> 15:48.488
with Group 7 access out of the system.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.617
I tell you, ever since he got
that Master Control Program,

15:52.701 --> 15:55.328
system's got more bugs
than a bait store.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.248
Gotta expect some static.
After all, computers are just machines.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.583
They can't think.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.169
Some programs'll be thinking soon.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.755
Won't that be grand?
Computers and the programs

16:05.839 --> 16:08.383
will start thinking
and the people will stop.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.385
Well, I'm gonna stay around,
put some data through.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.345
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.683
- Come on.
- Did you say Group 7 access?

16:17.351 --> 16:19.727
Yeah. What a hassle.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.064
- I was all set.
- Did he say why?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.900
It was something about tampering.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.778
Tampering. You know,
Flynn has been thinking about

16:28.862 --> 16:32.031
breaking into the system
ever since Dillinger canned him,

16:32.116 --> 16:34.158
and he had Group 7 access.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.703
Flynn had access to you, too.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.418
- I wanna go to Flynn's place.
- What for?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.087
- To warn him.
- Of what?

16:46.922 --> 16:48.756
That Dillinger's on to him.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.218
I don't see why
I have to do that guy any favours.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.887
I don't know what you
ever saw in that guy anyway.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.431
I loved him for his brains.

16:58.767 --> 17:03.187
Don't put any change in the metre.
We're gonna need it for the games.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.528
Boy, haven't been here in a long time.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.621
Hey, Barbie, up here!

17:31.925 --> 17:33.926
- Let's go.
- Don't pull me.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.439
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Somewhere in here,

17:46.523 --> 17:48.566
lost in one of his games.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.943
Use the buzz bomb, ya idiot.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.073
Excuse me, champ.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.576
- Do you know where Flynn is?
- Yeah, he's over there on his machine.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.287
Hey, look. Somebody's got 300,000.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.669
He's really on a roll tonight.
One more Reco to go, and he ties it,

18:08.754 --> 18:12.465
but then another Reco,
and he gets the world's record.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.056
You better watch out
for this machine, man.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.350
- Yes!
- All right!

18:24.603 --> 18:26.813
The all-time record coming up!

18:30.734 --> 18:33.486
- This is it.
- It's all over.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.698
All right!

18:41.745 --> 18:43.830
Way to go!

18:44.206 --> 18:47.834
- Hey, Flynn, how'd you do it?
- It is all in the wrist.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.838
Nine hundred and ninety-nine
thousand points!

18:54.508 --> 18:57.176
Hey, good to see you guys.
Nothing classes up the joint

18:57.261 --> 18:58.970
like a clean-cut young couple.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.555
We gotta talk.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.809
Well, you can't even hear
yourself think in here. Come on.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.436
- Hey, come on, Flynn.
- All right, I'll be with you...

19:07.521 --> 19:08.521
I'll be down in a minute.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.234
So, how's the world of
serious science, huh? Go on up.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.528
Go up. Make yourselves at home.
Be right up.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.327
Geez. The best programmer
ENCOM ever saw,

19:23.412 --> 19:27.123
and he winds up playing
space cowboy in some back room.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.667
Okay, let me handle this.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.252
Go right ahead.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.298
Have you been sneaking
into the ENCOM system?

19:36.633 --> 19:39.760
God. You never were much
for small talk, were ya?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.347
She still leave her clothes
all over the floor?

19:43.432 --> 19:44.473
Flynn.

19:44.558 --> 19:48.060
- No. Well, I mean, not that often.
- Alan!

19:48.145 --> 19:51.147
Now you can see why all
of his friends are 14 years old.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.065
Touché. Touché.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.619
I have been doing a little hacking
in here, as a matter of fact.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.205
- You did break in.
- Tried to.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.042
Can't seem to quite get the connection
with that sucker, though.

20:11.501 --> 20:15.254
- Now if I had a direct terminal...
- Flynn, are you embezzling?

20:17.257 --> 20:20.509
Embezzling is such
an ugly word, Mr Bradley.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.930
No, actually, I'm trying to get
some solid evidence together.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.598
I don't get it.

20:27.059 --> 20:32.188
Okay. Sherman, set the way-back
machine for three years ago.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.565
Kevin Flynn,

20:35.525 --> 20:39.111
one of ENCOM's brightest
young software engineers.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.448
He's so bright, as a matter of fact,
that he starts going in at night,

20:42.532 --> 20:45.993
sets up his own private memory file,
and begins writing a program

20:46.078 --> 20:50.790
for a video game he's invented
called Space Paranoids.

20:50.958 --> 20:55.628
- You invented Space Paranoids?
- Paranoids. Matrix Blaster.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.129
Vice Squad. A whole slew of them.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.590
I was this close to starting
my own little enterprise, man.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.261
But enter another software engineer.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.639
Not so young, not so bright,
but very, very sneaky.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.140
Ed Dillinger.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.559
So one night our boy Flynn,

21:10.644 --> 21:12.770
he's goes to his terminal,
tries to read up his file.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.773
I get nothing on there.
There's a big blank.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.192
All right, now we take you
three months later.

21:18.277 --> 21:23.864
Dillinger presents ENCOM with
five video games that he's invented.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.242
The slime didn't even
change the names, man.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.202
He gets a big, fat promotion.

21:28.495 --> 21:32.498
And thus begins his meteoric rise to...
What is he now? Executive V.P.?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.333
Senior Exec.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.627
Senior Exec?

21:39.673 --> 21:41.007
Meanwhile, the kids are putting

21:41.091 --> 21:44.468
eight million quarters a week
into Paranoid machines.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.680
I don't see a dime,
except what I squeeze outta here.

21:48.265 --> 21:51.767
I still don't understand
why you wanna break into the system.

21:52.102 --> 21:56.897
Because, man, somewhere in
one of these memories is the evidence.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.859
If I got in far enough,
I could reconstruct it.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.778
My password, Dillinger's
instructions to divert the data.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.280
- The whole shot, man.
- It's too late for that.

22:04.364 --> 22:07.033
Dillinger's cut off everybody
with Group 7 access.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.451
Wait a... Wait, wait, wait.
What are you...

22:08.535 --> 22:09.577
What are you saying now?

22:10.370 --> 22:12.705
The guy knows what you're up to.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.416
Oh, great. You're kidding me.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.380
Well, now there is nothing to stop him.

22:22.591 --> 22:26.886
Now it's just Dillinger and the MCP
running things from on high in there.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.388
Not if my Tron program is running.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.890
That'd shut the system down.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.855
- You know, if your file was in there...
- Hey, wait a minute.

22:37.939 --> 22:41.609
If we can get in there,
I can forge us a Group 6 access.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.614
Well, shall we dance?

22:56.291 --> 22:58.751
I shut down Group 7
for a very good reason.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.711
Ed, all I'm saying
is that if our own people

23:00.796 --> 23:02.963
can't get access to their programs...

23:03.048 --> 23:04.507
Well, you know how frustrating it is

23:04.591 --> 23:06.175
when you're working
on a piece of research.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.259
Walter, I sympathise,

23:07.344 --> 23:09.720
but I have data coming from
the Master Control Program

23:09.805 --> 23:12.014
telling me there's something
screwy going on around here.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.809
That MCP.
That's half our problem right there.

23:15.018 --> 23:18.104
The MCP is the most efficient way
of handling what we do.

23:18.355 --> 23:21.357
I can't sit here and worry about
every little user request that comes in.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.609
User requests are what
computers are for.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.320
Doing our business
is what computers are for.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.633
ENCOM isn't the business
you started in your garage any more.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.052
We're billing accounts
in 30 different countries.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.303
New defence systems.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.306
We have one of the most sophisticated
pieces of equipment in existence.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.183
I know all that.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.813
Sometimes I wish
I were back in that garage.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.691
That can be arranged, Walter.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.278
That was uncalled for.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.406
You know, you can remove men
like Alan and me from the system,

24:10.490 --> 24:11.699
but we helped create it,

24:11.783 --> 24:15.744
and our spirit remains in every program
we designed for this computer.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.205
Walter, it's getting late.
I've got better things to do

24:18.290 --> 24:20.332
than to have
religious discussions with you.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.294
Don't worry about ENCOM any more.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.504
It's out of your hands now.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.431
I don't think I'm cleared for this.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.640
Well, I'm certainly not.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.018
You wanna move aside?
Give the kid a little room?

24:39.102 --> 24:40.603
Will you shush?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.566
This guy's a little like Santa Claus.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.195
Make these myself. You want one?

25:00.999 --> 25:03.459
They never should have
gotten rid of me.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.548
- Now, that is a big door.
- Shut up.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.644
It's my fault.
I programmed you to want too much.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.146
I was planning to hit
the Pentagon next week.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.357
The Pentagon?

25:26.691 --> 25:29.401
It shouldn't be any harder
than any other big company.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.363
But now this is what I get
for using humans.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.615
Now wait a minute. I wrote you.

25:34.699 --> 25:39.620
I've gotten 2,415 times
smarter since then.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.622
What do you want with the Pentagon?

25:41.706 --> 25:43.624
The same thing I want
with the Kremlin.

25:43.708 --> 25:48.170
I'm bored with corporations.
With the information I can access,

25:48.255 --> 25:52.383
I can run things 900 to 1200 times
better than any human.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.010
If you think you're superior to us...

25:55.095 --> 25:57.012
You wouldn't want me to dig up
Flynn's file

25:57.097 --> 26:00.933
and read it up on a VDT at The Times,
would you?

26:01.142 --> 26:02.601
You wouldn't dare.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.320
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.823
- Working late?
- Yeah.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.499
Okay, come here.
I'm gonna put him at my terminal.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.002
I'm gonna meet you
in your office upstairs.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.712
Don't fall asleep.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.755
If and when I activate
your Tron program,

26:31.840 --> 26:32.881
you're only gonna have
a few minutes to use it

26:32.966 --> 26:35.301
before Dillinger catches
the break in security, all right?

26:36.469 --> 26:38.137
As long as we stay off the top floor,

26:38.221 --> 26:40.681
Dillinger will never know
we've been in here.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.516
Good luck, hot shot.

27:05.832 --> 27:06.999
Flynn!

27:07.584 --> 27:08.876
After you.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.610
Keep those programmers
out of the system,

27:34.694 --> 27:37.863
and get me that Chinese
language file I asked for.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.198
End of line.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.176
You are gonna stay with me,
aren't you?

27:59.260 --> 28:02.137
What for? You're the one
who never needed help, remember?

28:02.222 --> 28:04.348
Hey, come on. I'm scared of the dark.

28:04.432 --> 28:07.434
All this technology scares me.
Come on, babe.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.841
This way.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.559
- When did they put this in?
- This is where I work now.

28:48.643 --> 28:51.061
I've got a direct terminal
in the laser target area.

28:51.146 --> 28:54.022
You can stay there all night
if you have to.

29:00.488 --> 29:03.449
Like the man says,
there's no problems, only solutions.

29:03.616 --> 29:06.535
Okay, remember,
this laser is my life's work.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.413
Don't spill anything, huh?

29:10.165 --> 29:12.040
Have fun, sweetheart.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.809
- You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.
- Hey, hey, hey.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.812
It's the big Master Control Program
everybody's been talking about.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.607
Sit right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

29:36.691 --> 29:39.693
Remember the time we used
to spend playing chess together?

29:43.698 --> 29:46.658
That isn't going to do you
any good, Flynn. I'm afraid...

29:47.327 --> 29:49.328
Stop. Please.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.789
You realise I can't allow this.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.081
Now how are you gonna
run the universe

29:53.166 --> 29:55.876
if you can't even answer
a few unsolvable problems, huh?

29:56.294 --> 29:58.212
Come on, big fella.
Let's see what you got.

29:58.671 --> 30:01.173
I'd like to go against you
and see what you're made of.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.634
You know, you don't look
a thing like your pictures.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.177
I'm warning you.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.804
You're entering a big error, Flynn.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.348
I'm gonna have to put you
on the game grid.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.058
Games? You want games?

30:11.142 --> 30:12.309
I'll give you games.

31:49.032 --> 31:52.826
Oh, man, this isn't happening.
It only thinks it's happening.

31:54.287 --> 31:57.164
Vacate entry port, program.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.629
I said move!

32:06.174 --> 32:07.299
Hey!

32:08.927 --> 32:12.596
Look, if this is about those parking
tickets, I can explain everything, okay?

32:18.353 --> 32:20.562
Zero programs with war games.

32:23.399 --> 32:26.902
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark.
A new recruit.

32:26.986 --> 32:30.113
He's a tough case, but I want him
treated in the usual manner.

32:30.198 --> 32:34.993
Train him for the games, let him hope
for a while and blow him away.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.662
You got it.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.582
I've been hoping you'd send me
somebody with a little bit of guts.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.501
What kind of program is he?

32:42.669 --> 32:46.171
He's not any kind of program, Sark.
He's a user.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.382
- A user?
- That's right.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.968
He pushed me in the real world.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.428
Somebody pushes me, I push back.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.013
So, I brought him down here.

32:56.349 --> 32:59.226
What's the matter, Sark?
You look nervous.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.019
Well, I...

33:01.854 --> 33:03.313
It's just...

33:04.857 --> 33:07.192
I don't know. A user. I mean...

33:07.986 --> 33:10.028
Users wrote us.

33:11.531 --> 33:15.033
- A user even wrote you!
- No one user wrote me.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.536
I'm worth millions of their man-years.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.037
What if I can't...

33:19.122 --> 33:21.790
You rather take your chances with me?

33:22.208 --> 33:24.668
Want me to slow down
your power cycles for you?

33:24.752 --> 33:26.712
Wait! I need that!

33:27.046 --> 33:30.799
Then pull yourself together.
Get this clown trained.

33:30.883 --> 33:35.095
I want him in the games
until he dies playing. Acknowledge.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.764
Acknowledged, Master Control.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.600
End of line.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.442
- Video game unit 18.
- In here, program.

33:49.068 --> 33:51.695
Hey, who you
calling program, program?

33:56.075 --> 33:57.200
New guy.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.328
Another free program offline.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.165
You really think
the users are still there?

34:03.541 --> 34:05.125
They'd better be.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.753
I don't wanna bust out of here
and find nothing

34:07.837 --> 34:09.629
but a lot of cold circuits waiting for me.

34:09.714 --> 34:10.755
Hey.

34:13.592 --> 34:16.011
- Who are you guys?
- Hold it.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.263
Wanna watch those force fields.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.516
You'll be having plenty of chances
to get hurt. Don't worry about that.

34:22.935 --> 34:28.940
Look, just so I can tell my friends
what this dream is about, okay?

34:29.025 --> 34:31.777
- Where am I?
- You're a

34:36.699 --> 34:40.534
guest of the Master Control Program.

34:40.786 --> 34:44.414
- Oh, great.
- Gonna make you play video games.

34:44.791 --> 34:48.793
Okay. No sweat.
I play video games better than anybody.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.384
Move out! This way!

35:00.932 --> 35:02.849
You. You come this way.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.103
Hey, there's been a mistake.
I gotta see the guy in charge.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.479
You will.

35:29.335 --> 35:33.630
Look, operative. Command program
Sark's carrier is approaching.

35:34.006 --> 35:36.842
He will explain the training procedures.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.391
Greetings.

35:46.018 --> 35:50.105
The Master Control Program
has chosen you

35:50.731 --> 35:53.900
to serve your system on the game grid.

35:54.235 --> 35:58.029
Those of you who continue
to profess a belief in the users

35:58.489 --> 36:02.075
will receive the standard
substandard training,

36:02.577 --> 36:06.037
which will result
in your eventual elimination.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.624
Those of you who renounce

36:10.293 --> 36:13.920
this superstitious and hysterical belief

36:15.298 --> 36:18.466
will be eligible to join the warrior elite

36:19.594 --> 36:21.386
of the MCP.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.931
You will each receive an identity disc.

36:25.516 --> 36:31.104
Everything you do or learn
will be imprinted on this disc.

36:31.689 --> 36:35.692
If you lose your disc
or fail to follow commands,

36:36.235 --> 36:40.155
you will be subject
to immediate de-resolution.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.657
That will be all.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.038
Move out.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.095
Hey. Who's that guy?

37:04.305 --> 37:07.891
- That's Tron. He fights for the users.
- Tron.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.097
- That's pretty good.
- Watch this.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.974
You gotta be good
if you wanna survive.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.600
What's your name?

37:51.018 --> 37:52.978
My name's Ram.

37:56.732 --> 38:00.318
Hey, Ram.
What were you, you know, before?

38:01.195 --> 38:03.363
I was an actuarial program.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.865
Worked for a big insurance company.

38:07.410 --> 38:11.997
Really gives you a great feeling helping
folks plan for their future needs.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.916
And, of course, if you think of the
payments as an annuity over the years,

38:15.001 --> 38:16.751
the cost is really quite minimal.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.753
Yeah. That's great.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.755
Actuarial program. Nice.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.050
How about yourself?

38:24.927 --> 38:28.430
I don't remember too much.
Name's Flynn.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.434
Sure. A little disorientation.
That's normal in transport.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.810
It'll come back to you.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.190
This is it. Good luck, Flynn.

38:41.527 --> 38:45.322
Sir, conscript being moved
from pit cell to ring game.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.198
You know... Hey!

38:48.367 --> 38:49.909
You guys sure are friendly, aren't you?

38:49.994 --> 38:51.161
Wait.

38:54.707 --> 38:57.250
Let him fight one of his own kind.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.207
You think you're gonna
wipe me right out, don't you?

39:37.416 --> 39:38.958
No, I...

39:42.463 --> 39:43.588
Hey, I... I... I...

39:50.638 --> 39:52.847
New guy was asking about you.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.184
It's too bad he's in a match now.

39:56.268 --> 39:59.145
- I'll probably never meet him.
- You might.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.315
There's something different about him.

40:15.454 --> 40:16.955
Okay.

40:40.729 --> 40:42.397
That was a very fancy shot.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.485
Okay, here's an easy one.

41:04.420 --> 41:07.130
- Finish the game!
- No!

41:07.381 --> 41:08.381
Kill him.

41:10.509 --> 41:11.551
No!

41:13.637 --> 41:15.472
You'll regret this.

41:34.158 --> 41:37.327
I want him in the games
until he dies playing.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.427
This is the holding area
for the Lightcycles.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.304
Hey, Flynn. You made it!

41:56.388 --> 41:58.973
- Wait here.
- You won!

42:00.768 --> 42:03.353
- Alan!
- Where did you hear that name?

42:03.437 --> 42:06.731
- Well, that's your name, isn't it?
- The name of my user.

42:10.152 --> 42:11.861
How did you know?

42:12.279 --> 42:14.197
I'm a program from a user
that knows Alan.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.950
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.244
Yeah, but I'm remembering
all kinds of stuff.

42:19.328 --> 42:22.080
Like my user wants me
to go after the MCP.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.625
- My user wants that, too.
- I know.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.891
Prepare to transport to Lightcycle grid.

42:44.979 --> 42:48.481
- We have transport.
- Wow.

42:59.618 --> 43:03.454
This is blue leader to blue bikes.
Run these guys into your jet walls.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.039
- Copy, blue leader.
- Copy, blue leader.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.750
This is gold one to gold two
and three. Split up.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.294
Take them one on one.

43:40.868 --> 43:41.868
Watch it! Watch it!

44:01.347 --> 44:03.765
I'm taking him into the maze.

44:15.444 --> 44:17.445
This is it. Come on.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.082
Gold three to gold two and one.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.167
I'm getting out of here right now,
and you guys are invited.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.835
Got it.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.048
- Ready?
- Ready.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.050
So long, sucker.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.778
Greetings, programs.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.990
Video game warriors
escaping game grid.

45:03.075 --> 45:06.285
This is an illegal exit.
You must return immediately.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.830
Repeat, this is an illegal exit.

45:08.914 --> 45:11.040
- You must return to the grid.
- Gold two to gold three.

45:11.166 --> 45:13.459
Those demons are coming down.

45:24.763 --> 45:26.222
Get them.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.600
Send out every game tank in the grid.

45:30.602 --> 45:32.437
Get them!

45:33.939 --> 45:37.316
I should never have written
all those tank programs.

45:50.122 --> 45:52.248
Targets leaving protective field.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.128
Missed!

46:04.470 --> 46:06.179
All units exiting game arena!

46:24.448 --> 46:27.241
Target units accelerating!

46:41.381 --> 46:44.050
Pursuit force minus one tank.
Close ranks.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.534
Oh, man.

47:13.497 --> 47:17.333
On the other side of the screen,
it all looked so easy.

47:23.006 --> 47:25.550
They must've gone right past us.

47:27.511 --> 47:32.098
We made it...this far.

47:36.937 --> 47:40.022
Pursuit force reporting. We lost
visual contact with escaped units.

47:40.107 --> 47:41.190
Awaiting further orders.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.401
Get the pursuit forces
back into the canyons.

47:43.485 --> 47:45.194
Those programs never
made it out of there.

47:45.279 --> 47:48.281
We'll have them back in no time, sir,
long before the interrupt interface.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.533
We'd better, Null Unit.

47:51.410 --> 47:54.871
I'll be lucky if the MCP doesn't
blast me into a dead zone.

47:55.247 --> 47:56.914
I want those conscripts!

48:06.174 --> 48:08.426
What is it? What do you see?

48:08.760 --> 48:10.678
Watch it. Watch it.

48:15.642 --> 48:17.476
Come on, you little bugger. Come on.

48:18.145 --> 48:19.896
Look at that.

48:20.939 --> 48:24.191
When do we pay our visit
to the old Master Control, huh?

48:24.401 --> 48:25.943
What?

48:27.821 --> 48:30.114
There's just three of us.

48:31.116 --> 48:33.534
Well, you know anybody who's
got an army for rent, that's fine.

48:33.619 --> 48:37.246
But my user told me
to go take that sucker out,

48:37.331 --> 48:39.248
or I'm never getting outta here.

48:39.333 --> 48:43.044
We can't get to the MCP
without the help of my user.

48:45.547 --> 48:47.715
I have to get to that input/output tower

48:48.300 --> 48:49.842
and communicate with him.

48:52.846 --> 48:55.640
Well, good. Check in with Alan.
Maybe he knows what's...

48:55.974 --> 48:57.725
What's that?

48:57.809 --> 49:03.064
That is just what I need right now.

49:20.165 --> 49:21.499
It's nice.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.051
Incredible.

49:41.019 --> 49:43.312
Boy, you forget
how good the power feels

49:44.064 --> 49:46.023
until you get to a pure source.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.238
My friends, my fellow conscripts,
we have scored.

49:52.322 --> 49:55.032
I feel so much better.

49:59.204 --> 50:01.789
Pursuit force reporting.
No sign of escaped units.

50:01.873 --> 50:03.374
Moving into next sector.

50:09.756 --> 50:11.215
- Thank you.
- I can feel it.

50:13.176 --> 50:15.219
Feel what? You okay?

50:18.056 --> 50:19.557
Alan One.

50:21.643 --> 50:23.060
Let's move out!

50:34.072 --> 50:38.034
- Come on, Flynn. Put a cork in it.
- One second.

51:09.566 --> 51:14.612
Range: nine. Mark: 45, 48 degrees.

51:21.286 --> 51:24.455
Hold it. Hold it. Fire!

51:37.010 --> 51:38.636
Ram! Flynn! Do you read me?

51:38.762 --> 51:41.347
Pursuit force reporting.
Two escaped units de-rezzed.

51:41.932 --> 51:43.307
No!

51:55.529 --> 51:57.321
Tron unit heading into next sector.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.747
Ram. Ram!

52:10.460 --> 52:12.837
Come on! We gotta get outta here.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.384
No sign of life. Looks like we got them.

52:27.602 --> 52:30.062
Continue pursuit
of remaining conscript.

52:30.147 --> 52:33.315
Acknowledged.
Proceeding toward sector frontier.

52:37.863 --> 52:40.865
We're gonna make it, Ram.
I just gotta find you a place to rest.

52:57.299 --> 52:59.258
Hang in there, Ram.

52:59.551 --> 53:01.218
This looks like a good spot.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.563
Those tanks won't find us here.

53:14.065 --> 53:15.524
Okay.

53:18.361 --> 53:21.030
I thought this was supposed to be easy.

53:54.564 --> 53:57.107
What's going on?

54:03.782 --> 54:04.949
You see this?

54:06.117 --> 54:07.701
You shouldn't be able to do that.

54:17.629 --> 54:19.797
Now for some real user power.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.497
Hey, this looks promising.

54:58.837 --> 55:01.755
This is just like the old arcade grips.

55:05.010 --> 55:08.012
All right, let's get this show on the road.

55:16.855 --> 55:19.231
Now we're smoking.

55:19.316 --> 55:21.275
How can you steal a Recogniser?

55:21.359 --> 55:23.444
Hey, you okay? You don't look so good.

55:24.112 --> 55:25.821
We'll get you fixed up. Hang on.

55:25.905 --> 55:27.239
Come here.

55:50.847 --> 55:55.559
My user. Users are users. They...

56:01.024 --> 56:02.232
Are you a user?

56:04.027 --> 56:05.402
Yeah.

56:16.748 --> 56:18.374
Flynn?

56:20.251 --> 56:21.418
Help Tron.

56:33.139 --> 56:34.431
Ram.

56:43.149 --> 56:44.525
Ram!

57:29.487 --> 57:31.405
Damn Recogniser.

57:33.658 --> 57:35.868
Why won't the thing just go straight?

57:37.036 --> 57:39.496
I gotta get to that I/O tower.

57:39.998 --> 57:44.168
Program ALOU. Request
additional information for Sector 2.

57:44.669 --> 57:47.296
Prepare hangar for
game simulation transport.

57:47.714 --> 57:51.175
Attention, all units.
Lock onto matrix code.

57:51.676 --> 57:53.760
Prepare for digital beam transport.

57:54.179 --> 57:55.679
Activate hangar doors.

57:59.017 --> 58:00.851
What's the progress on the simulation?

58:01.060 --> 58:04.605
Thirty, 56. Ninety-nine are correct.

58:05.190 --> 58:08.567
Limited four and eight are missing.

58:12.989 --> 58:14.698
Don't scream.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.742
Yori.

58:16.826 --> 58:19.620
Thirty, 56. Ninety-nine are correct.

58:20.038 --> 58:23.040
- Limited four and eight are missing.
- No, I...

58:26.461 --> 58:27.544
Tron.

58:32.050 --> 58:33.175
Yori.

58:35.386 --> 58:37.221
I knew you'd escape.

58:38.014 --> 58:40.057
They haven't built a circuit
that could hold you.

58:40.767 --> 58:43.393
Listen, Yori. We have to make plans.

58:44.062 --> 58:45.979
Where can we go?

58:51.152 --> 58:53.737
This way. Quickly.

59:01.829 --> 59:02.913
Hey!

59:05.750 --> 59:07.084
Hold it right there!

59:08.169 --> 59:10.420
- Yes.
- What do you mean "yes"?

59:11.589 --> 59:13.924
- Yes.
- Is that all you can say?

59:17.387 --> 59:19.805
- No.
- Anything else?

59:20.181 --> 59:21.265
Yes.

59:23.434 --> 59:25.602
Positive and negative, huh?
You're a bit.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.187
Yes.

59:28.940 --> 59:31.108
Well, where's your program?
Isn't he gonna miss ya?

59:31.651 --> 59:34.736
- No.
- I'm your program?

59:35.446 --> 59:38.448
- Yes.
- Another mouth to feed.

59:39.242 --> 59:41.159
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

59:50.628 --> 59:52.796
Watch out for nested macros.

59:55.341 --> 59:58.260
- Who are all these weirdos?
- Inoperative data pushers.

59:58.553 --> 59:59.553
Control programs. Come on.

59:59.637 --> 01:00:01.013
These tendencies
must be discouraged.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:04.975
Pretty good driving, huh?

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.648
- No.
- Who asked you?

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:30.667
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.936
This baby doesn't handle
so good in town.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:51.480
No.

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:57.986
- What's this do? How about this one?
- No. No, no.

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:02.032
Here comes a headache.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.537
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.626
- We gotta stop this thing!
- Yes.

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:15.837
I'm glad you agree!

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:41.321
- I'm fine. No problem.
- I hope they hurry.

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.241
My next assignment is in Quadrant 4.

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:47.077
This town is full of live ones.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:51.915
Hey.

01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:02.259
This is where Tron said he was going.

01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.180
Losing Flynn.

01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:39.588
I don't believe this.

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:52.934
Halt!

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:02.360
More guards.

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:01.336
They don't see us. I'll go first.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.611
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Let's do that some more.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.656
Yeah. I think the guard saw me.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:31.658
Come on.

01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:42.502
- Halt.
- Dumont.

01:04:42.587 --> 01:04:45.088
I can't stand all this commotion.
What do you want?

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:47.382
I've come to communicate with my user.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:51.428
Difficult proposition.
Difficult proposition at best.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:55.265
Why, I could be de-rezzed
just for letting you in here.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.018
They hate this tower.

01:04:58.102 --> 01:05:00.854
They'd close it down if they dared.

01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:03.148
They keep me around
just in case one of them

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.859
wants to deal with
the other world once in a while.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:07.235
Dumont!

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:12.908
My user has information that could,

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.160
well, could make this
a free system again.

01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:16.953
No, really.

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:20.582
Why, you'd have programs lined up
just to use this place.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:23.627
And no MCP looking
over your shoulder.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.046
When you've been in the system
as long as I have,

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:30.842
you hear many promises,
many reassurances, many brave plans.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:34.262
Please, Dumont.
The guards are coming.

01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:38.058
There they are, with the guardian.

01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:40.644
All right, Yori. All right.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.607
Who is your user, program?

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:51.404
Alan One. He calls me. May I pass?

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:56.826
All that is visible
must grow beyond itself

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:59.996
and extend into the realm
of the invisible.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.041
You may pass, my friend.

01:06:12.593 --> 01:06:15.011
The tower guardian is helping him.

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:17.180
He thinks.

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:19.557
Bring in the logic probe!

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:40.370
More power!

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.766
It's begun.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:47.187
Tron, location query. Confirm.

01:07:47.271 --> 01:07:48.855
Confirmed, Alan One.

01:07:48.939 --> 01:07:51.316
I am creating the information
on your disc

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.527
that will erase the MCP
and change the system.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:58.448
Dedicate yourself to getting
the disc into the heart of the MCP.

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:01.618
This interface is located at its base.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.995
We will not be able
to communicate again

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.538
unless you succeed.

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:07.290
Go.

01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:21.136
This is the key to a new order.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:24.182
This code disc means freedom.

01:08:26.977 --> 01:08:28.478
I think they're breaking in.

01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:40.323
- Thank you, Dumont.
- Hurry. The users are waiting.

01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:57.506
Dumont!

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:02.761
Where's the program?

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.849
What program?

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.227
Take him!

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:21.488
Stay close.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:34.711
If I can just get us on
the scanning transport beam,

01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:36.337
this Solar Sailer simulation

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:38.881
will take us across the game sea,
out of this domain,

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.591
back into the central computer.

01:09:49.059 --> 01:09:50.977
Look out!

01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:14.686
Commander, you've enjoyed
all the power you've been given,

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:15.812
haven't you?

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:18.731
I wonder how you'd take to
working in a pocket calculator.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.318
We did take care of
that user you sent us.

01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:23.736
You incompetent zero.

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.488
Now you've got
two renegade programs

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:28.157
flying all over the system
in a stolen simulation.

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:31.869
We'll get them.
It's only a matter of time.

01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:33.955
You've almost reached
your decision gate,

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:35.832
and I can't spare you any more time.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.250
End of line.

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:47.635
Hey, it's me! Flynn!

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.513
- Flynn!
- Yeah. Greetings, program.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:51.973
Flynn, you're alive.

01:11:53.183 --> 01:11:54.350
Barely.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:56.811
Yeah, I...

01:12:12.786 --> 01:12:13.953
Where's Ram?

01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:16.247
He didn't make it.

01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:26.883
Well, come on.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.272
Lora.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.110
This is Flynn,
the one who busted me out.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:50.073
- Lora?
- Well, then, I owe him some thanks.

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.411
No, it's no big deal.

01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:57.372
I ought to know my way
around a Lightcycle routine.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:12:58.539
I wrote the program for it.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.751
- You wrote the program?
- It's time I level with you.

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.753
I'm what you guys call a user.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.049
- You're a user?
- I took a wrong turn somewhere.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:10.968
If you are a user,

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.096
then everything you've done
has been according to a plan, right?

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:15.390
You wish.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:19.268
Well, you guys know what it's like.
You just keep doing what it looks like

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.813
you're supposed to be doing,
no matter how crazy it seems.

01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:24.649
Well, that's the way it is
for programs, yes.

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.567
I hate to disappoint you, pal,
but most of the time,

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:28.611
that's the way it is for users, too.

01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:31.197
Stranger and stranger.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:34.700
So, nice-looking ship you got here.

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:57.348
Sir, what do you want done
with the tower guardian, Dumont?

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.559
Put him with the others?

01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:02.437
No, bit brain.
Prepare him for inquisition.

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:06.232
I need a little bit of relaxation.
But first, rez up the carrier for pursuit.

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:09.152
One other thing, don't think any more.

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.904
I do the thinking around here.

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:21.873
This isn't gonna be easy.
If those grid bugs get us, we've had it.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:49.859
- Had enough?
- What do you want? I'm busy.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:53.362
Busy dying, you worn-out excuse
for an old program?

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.865
Yes, I'm old.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.744
Old enough to remember the MCP
when it was just a chess program.

01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:02.455
He started small, and he'll end small.

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:03.789
Very funny, Dumont.

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:06.542
Maybe I should keep you around
just to make me laugh.

01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:19.847
- What's happening?
- Power surge from the MCP.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.891
- We have to get off this beam.
- I can't.

01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:24.560
There isn't another junction
for seven or eight nanoseconds.

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:28.022
- There's another beam!
- It's too far.

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:48.918
He's creating a junction.

01:16:11.775 --> 01:16:13.693
Did we make it?

01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:16.946
- Yeah.
- Hooray for our side.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.516
- Is he de-rezzing?
- No.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.727
But I couldn't tell you why not.

01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:53.566
I'm all in one piece.

01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:55.735
I guess I'm still with ya.

01:16:58.822 --> 01:17:01.365
Tell the guy with the jackhammer
to lay off, will ya?

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.992
How did you do that?

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:06.621
Elementary physics: a beam of energy
can always be diverted.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:08.581
Are we there yet, Mommy?

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.220
Sark!

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:21.278
- Dumont!
- Yori!

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.533
Tron?

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:29.370
Tron's dead.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.959
- Who's that?
- That is a user, Dumont.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.587
He came here to help us.

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.924
Tron believed in him.

01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:46.053
If the users can no longer help us,
we're lost.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:49.223
So, we have erased that program...

01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:52.935
No. You were de-rezzed. I saw you.

01:18:53.019 --> 01:18:55.938
- Not me, Sark.
- There's nothing special about you.

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:58.649
- You're just an ordinary program.
- So are you.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:01.610
- One that should've been erased.
- You're nothing!

01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:06.240
Take that program to the holding pit!

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:15.666
Please, don't take him...

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:19.503
We're taking our friend here

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.548
and some other religious fanatics
to Master Control.

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:26.051
When I disembark,

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:29.430
this ship and everything
that remains on board

01:19:29.514 --> 01:19:31.807
will automatically de-rez.

01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:35.895
This means you.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.195
Move out!

01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:17.269
- Intermediate vectors detached.
- Route us to the MCP.

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:18.938
I want to get rid of this dead weight

01:20:19.022 --> 01:20:21.398
and catch a transport beam
to the game domain.

01:20:31.284 --> 01:20:35.704
These walls. Yori.
Something's happening.

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.601
Hey.

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:41.770
Yori?

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:45.649
I still have power.
Sark doesn't know that.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:50.529
- Leave me alone. We've failed.
- We're only gonna fail if we give up!

01:21:50.614 --> 01:21:52.781
Now come on! Look! The wall!

01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:55.784
Yori.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.422
You brought me back. How?

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:11.175
Why did you bring me back?

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:13.177
I need your help. Come on.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.542
Do something with these controls!

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.711
- I'm on it.
- It's the MCP.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:49.713
It's the heart of the whole system.

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:17.408
I feel a presence.
Another warrior is on the mesa.

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:22.329
Sark!

01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:27.042
We're getting closer.

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:35.134
I don't know how you survived, slave.

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:38.178
It doesn't matter. Prepare to terminate.

01:23:51.943 --> 01:23:55.070
All programs have a desire
to be useful.

01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:58.949
But in moments, you will no longer
seek communication with each other

01:23:59.075 --> 01:24:01.368
or your superfluous users.

01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:05.831
You will each be part of me,
and together, we will be complete.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:15.716
You should've joined me.
We'd have made a great team.

01:24:19.929 --> 01:24:23.432
- You're very persistent, Tron.
- I'm also better than you.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.698
Sark!

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:42.659
All my functions are now yours.

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:43.952
Take them.

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:53.128
Sark.

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:00.636
Look at that.

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:20.364
Your user can't help you now,
my little program.

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:34.002
I got it. Steer us over by the beam.

01:25:35.004 --> 01:25:37.840
- Right next to it.
- What good'll that do?

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.717
I'm gonna jump.

01:25:43.179 --> 01:25:46.098
- It's the only way to help Tron.
- Don't. You'll be de-rezzed.

01:26:05.368 --> 01:26:07.161
Don't worry.

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:17.606
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:02.192
We did it!

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:14.663
- That's nice.
- We thought you were dead.

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:17.582
Where's Flynn?

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:20.085
It was incredible.
He threw himself into the beam

01:28:20.169 --> 01:28:24.298
and distracted the MCP just
long enough for you to get the disc in.

01:28:24.924 --> 01:28:27.301
He saved us. He really did it.

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:30.345
Video warriors, look at the I/O towers.

01:28:33.057 --> 01:28:35.267
Every tower is lighting up.

01:29:29.489 --> 01:29:31.406
Priority one!

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:40.248
Hey!

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:31.633
Try to look official.
Here comes the boss.

01:30:48.192 --> 01:30:50.610
Pick me up in an hour. Thanks.

01:30:51.737 --> 01:30:53.488
Greetings, programs.

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:55.295
In the jungle, I run tonight

01:33:55.379 --> 01:33:57.964
Find no peace to logical life

01:33:59.091 --> 01:34:01.468
No confusion, just wrong or right

01:34:01.552 --> 01:34:03.136
Oh, yeah

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:09.225
Faces, numbers I recognise

01:34:09.685 --> 01:34:12.896
You don't fool me with cynical lies

01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:15.440
No problems, no compromise

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.150
Oh, yeah

01:34:18.778 --> 01:34:21.363
Only solutions

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:25.909
Don't pull me down
I just wanna hear

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:28.370
Only solutions

01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:32.874
It won't be long
It won't take too long

01:34:40.132 --> 01:34:43.426
Modern times drive me insane

01:34:43.761 --> 01:34:46.930
Explanations I can't explain

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:49.516
Leave me standing in the rain

01:34:49.809 --> 01:34:51.059
Oh, yeah

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.691
Solving mysteries with nothing to lose

01:34:58.067 --> 01:35:01.319
Magic leaves you without any clues

01:35:01.612 --> 01:35:04.155
There's only so much one man can do

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.699
Oh, yeah

01:35:07.159 --> 01:35:09.869
Only solutions

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:14.332
Don't pull me down
I just wanna hear

01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:17.001
Only solutions

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:21.131
