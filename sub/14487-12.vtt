WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:04.405
ANNOUNCER:
Prepare for
the stereophonic experience.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.274
( beatboxing theme song )

00:12.179 --> 00:14.381
BENDER:
Ah, New New York City!

00:18.852 --> 00:20.754
BENDER:
Don't worry about it.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.957
Do the robot, baby!

00:40.240 --> 00:44.811
Oh, Lord, hiking is always
such a strain on the buttocks.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.816
Shh. What was
that sound?

00:48.915 --> 00:50.651
It wasn't a bird's nest falling.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.984
That sounds like this.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.054
( chirping )

00:55.155 --> 00:57.158
Aw, they're so cute
when they're scared.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.093
I meant the sound
Bigfoot just made.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.262
He's been sighted a lot
in this area recently.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.731
Just last week,
a blind hiker
felt him.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.634
Don't tell me you
actually believe in Bigfoot

01:06.733 --> 01:08.301
you blathering ninnyhammer.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.469
Of course I do.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.903
Bigfoot's my hero.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.740
Growing up, he was the celebrity
I most identified with.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.608
Why?

01:14.707 --> 01:15.643
'Cause he was a loner

01:15.742 --> 01:17.177
who hated the popular monsters

01:17.277 --> 01:18.245
yet longed to be one.

01:18.346 --> 01:21.814
I can so relate to that.

01:21.914 --> 01:23.317
( crying )

01:23.417 --> 01:25.686
Ugh, enough emotions.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.489
This isn't a fat camp,
for God's sake.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.823
Although you wouldn't
know it from looking.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.665
( loud clanging )

01:38.765 --> 01:41.168
( sighs )

01:41.269 --> 01:43.971
Bender, if you want to sleep
in a tent tonight

01:44.070 --> 01:46.140
you're welcome
to join me and Hermes

01:46.240 --> 01:48.376
for a little
"just friends" spooning.

01:48.475 --> 01:51.278
Nah, I'm comfy out
here under the stars.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.213
Whoa! Whoa!

01:53.313 --> 01:54.948
Real comfy.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.520
Hi. I'm Ranger Park
the park ranger.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.453
I get it.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.388
Now, since this area's

02:01.489 --> 02:02.722
a national Bigfoot preserve

02:02.822 --> 02:04.692
we'll start with a short film
about Bigfoot

02:04.792 --> 02:06.326
while I make a few phone calls.

02:08.961 --> 02:13.066
ANNOUNCER:
Bigfoot... Endangered Mystery.

02:13.167 --> 02:17.003
In the dense forests
of the Pacific Northwest

02:17.103 --> 02:19.072
dwells the strange
and beautiful creature

02:19.173 --> 02:20.408
known as Bigfoot, perhaps.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.542
That proves it.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.843
Sadly, logging
and human settlement

02:23.943 --> 02:27.046
today threaten what might
possibly be his habitat

02:27.146 --> 02:29.682
although if it's not,
they don't.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.819
Bigfoot populations require
vast amounts of land

02:32.920 --> 02:34.322
to remain elusive in.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.689
They typically dwell
just behind rocks

02:36.789 --> 02:38.658
but are also sometimes playful

02:38.759 --> 02:40.527
bounding into thick fogs

02:40.627 --> 02:42.195
and out-of-focus areas.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.533
It should say "top quality
exercycle for sale."

02:45.633 --> 02:48.368
And could you put
"top quality" in bold?

02:48.468 --> 02:49.870
You can't? Okay, whatever.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.171
Remember, it's up to us.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.742
Bigfoot is a crucial part
of the ecosystem, if he exists.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.878
So, let's all help
keep Bigfoot possibly alive

02:58.978 --> 03:02.915
for future generations to
enjoy, unless he doesn't exist.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.055
All right,
I got to call you back.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.223
All right, questions?

03:09.323 --> 03:12.192
Yeah. Have yous
ever seens Bigfeet?

03:12.293 --> 03:13.426
Technically, no.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.962
But I do see him each night
in my dreams

03:16.062 --> 03:19.533
and each day in the smiling
faces of hairy children.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.967
Bunk! Bunk, I say.

03:21.068 --> 03:25.038
Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's
droppings or shut up!

03:25.138 --> 03:26.939
I have the droppings
of someone who saw Bigfoot.

03:27.039 --> 03:27.941
Shut up!

03:28.040 --> 03:29.810
Oh, my God. Look, it's Bigfoot!

03:29.909 --> 03:30.644
Where?

03:30.743 --> 03:31.978
Ah, he's gone.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.247
He said you should keep
wasting your life though.

03:34.348 --> 03:38.085
Oh, I saw Bigfoot crushing cars
at the county fair.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.788
What you saw was Bigfoot
the monster truck.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.389
But thanks for a great question.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.890
( mumbling ):
Oh...

03:43.990 --> 03:45.425
Sir, if I may?

03:45.526 --> 03:47.995
Why don't you just set up,
like, a billion video cameras

03:48.094 --> 03:50.062
in the woods
and see if he walks by one.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.265
Ah, that would be very expensive

03:52.365 --> 03:55.668
and most people who believe
in Bigfoot are broke.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.805
Hey, look, Bigfoot, he's back!

03:57.905 --> 03:58.472
Where?!

03:58.572 --> 04:00.473
Up your face.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.808
( laughing )

04:01.908 --> 04:03.443
Everybody do the Bender.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.948
( crickets chirping )

04:08.048 --> 04:10.318
The sky out here is amazing.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.185
Look at all
the satellites.

04:19.492 --> 04:22.295
Good night, employees.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.630
Good night.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.766
Good night, Hubert.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.870
You doing all right out there,
buddy?

04:29.970 --> 04:32.004
Better than these gnats.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.007
( electronic zapping )

04:34.106 --> 04:35.509
( laughs )

04:35.608 --> 04:37.978
That guy won't be going
home to his kids.

04:42.215 --> 04:45.117
( shivering )

04:45.218 --> 04:46.653
( owl hooting )

04:46.754 --> 04:48.021
What's that? A wolf?

04:48.120 --> 04:49.656
Or some kind of boogen?

04:49.757 --> 04:52.225
Oh, God, I wish I was safe
inside a tent.

04:53.526 --> 04:56.062
( fake voice ):
Fry! Fry, wake up.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.465
It's me, Bigface.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.867
Come out and groom
my mangy fur.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.168
( gasps )

05:01.267 --> 05:03.235
Bigfoot? You taught
yourself English?

05:04.672 --> 05:05.838
Bigfoot?

05:05.939 --> 05:08.341
Bigfoot?!

05:08.442 --> 05:10.377
( chuckles )

05:15.682 --> 05:18.485
( snoring )

05:18.586 --> 05:20.420
( mumbling in sleep )

05:20.521 --> 05:22.889
FRY:
Bigfoot, is that you?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.658
I'm not like the others,
Bigfoot.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.360
I see through
your monster coating

05:26.459 --> 05:27.827
to the gentle loner inside.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.829
I bet you have
a wounded raccoon friend

05:29.930 --> 05:32.665
that you tenderly nurse back
to health while you go...

05:32.766 --> 05:34.266
( cooing )

05:34.367 --> 05:37.504
But in the end they shoot you,
but you teach us about things.

05:42.009 --> 05:42.942
( chirping )

05:43.043 --> 05:45.879
( loud roaring )

05:45.978 --> 05:48.081
( wind whistling )

05:53.353 --> 05:54.922
( gasps )

05:56.355 --> 05:58.257
Oh, just a flying saucer.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.192
Excuse me. You can't park here.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.095
The parking area is over there.

06:02.194 --> 06:05.798
( beeping and whirring )

06:05.899 --> 06:07.968
Wow, nice tube.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.805
Well... hey, hey,
what's the big idea?

06:11.904 --> 06:13.040
Stop abducting me!

06:13.139 --> 06:15.709
Why does your vanity plate
say "Probe 1"?

06:15.809 --> 06:20.146
Heeeellllp!

06:25.485 --> 06:26.586
( birds chirping )

06:26.687 --> 06:27.588
( sighs )

06:27.687 --> 06:31.158
( all yawning )

06:31.257 --> 06:33.494
There's nothing so refreshing

06:33.593 --> 06:37.831
as the clean, crisp taste
of this bold, Canadian beer.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.800
Well, see you in an hour.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.334
I got to go do some business
behind that tree.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.778
( zipper rasping,
Bender grunting )

06:51.879 --> 06:52.913
Come on, you!

06:53.012 --> 06:54.014
( yells )

06:54.113 --> 06:55.816
Bender, wasn't that
Fry's tent?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.317
( mockingly ):
Wasn't that Fry's tent?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.088
Bender raises
a good point.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.322
Where is Fry?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.591
( panting )

07:08.696 --> 07:10.463
( chattering )

07:12.331 --> 07:14.701
Amy, you won't believe
what happened!

07:14.802 --> 07:16.435
It was so scary
that you wouldn't...

07:16.536 --> 07:18.004
( screams )

07:18.105 --> 07:20.641
I know, but listen,
it gets even scarier.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.543
Fry, what in Sega Genesis
happened to you?

07:23.644 --> 07:26.278
That's what I'm trying
to tell you. See...

07:26.379 --> 07:28.682
Why are you all staring
at me like that?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.850
Is there something on my face?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.151
Uh, no.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.122
Someone should tell him.

07:35.221 --> 07:36.990
Tell me what?
Nothing.

07:37.090 --> 07:41.394
Well, I have a lot of experience
telling patients bad news

07:41.495 --> 07:43.797
so let me break it
to him gently.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.500
Fry, you have no nose!

07:46.600 --> 07:48.134
Your nose is gone!

07:48.235 --> 07:49.970
You have no nose
on your face!

07:50.069 --> 07:51.471
Where it is,
I can't say

07:51.572 --> 07:53.874
but on your face it's not.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.975
What?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.177
( shrieks )

07:57.276 --> 07:58.545
Aw, I think it's sweet.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.079
You chopped off your nose

08:00.180 --> 08:02.882
so you could look more like
your hero-- me, Bender.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.552
My God, they must have
taken it last night.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.586
Which last night?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.387
In the woods.
I was walking.

08:08.487 --> 08:09.923
For Big Foot, looking.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.858
And then aliens beamed me up.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.827
Were they little gray dudes
with the big oval heads?

08:16.396 --> 08:18.665
I don't get that gesture.
Am I wrong?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.167
Cheer up, friend.

08:20.266 --> 08:23.670
When we get home,
a high-quality prosthesis

08:23.771 --> 08:26.406
will have you looking
good as new.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.507
I'm a pathetic freak.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.177
My life is ruined.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.511
( laughs )

08:31.612 --> 08:34.715
Man, you are such a jokester.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.717
I'll never have another moment
of happiness.

08:37.817 --> 08:42.590
( all laughing )

08:42.690 --> 08:45.192
I know you're trying
to mask your pain
with humor

08:45.292 --> 08:46.594
but don't worry.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.928
I'm sure the Professor
can clone you a new nose.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.230
It wouldn't be the same;
I want my nose.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.466
I don't want to have
to teach a new one

08:53.567 --> 08:55.368
how to shoot milk when I laugh.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.904
Well, there's
no sense fretting.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.807
Good lord, you're ugly.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.307
The fact is
your nose is gone

09:01.408 --> 09:03.543
and we'll never find out
who did it or why.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.544
( hatch opens )

09:05.645 --> 09:08.315
Guys, guys, there's something
on television!

09:08.414 --> 09:12.653
Alien abductions--
until now a harmless nuisance

09:12.753 --> 09:15.989
but recently they've taken on
a sinister dimension

09:16.088 --> 09:19.292
as unsuspecting victims
are returned without noses.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.460
Like me.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.995
The culprits:
shameless poachers

09:23.096 --> 09:24.965
hunting humans
without a permit.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.600
The valuable nose--
or "human horn"--

09:27.701 --> 09:31.403
fetches a high price
on alien worlds as an
aphrodisiac.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.505
My nose is an aphrodisiac?

09:33.606 --> 09:34.607
( groans )

09:34.707 --> 09:36.143
I'm gonna drop a barf!

09:36.243 --> 09:38.345
Demand for human horn is great

09:38.445 --> 09:40.681
due in part
to titillating scenes

09:40.780 --> 09:45.284
from depraved alien TV programs
too filthy for Earth broadcast.

09:45.384 --> 09:46.119
Let's watch.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.155
( gasps )

09:49.255 --> 09:50.157
Human horn?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.192
But it is forbidden.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.028
So is our love.

10:01.668 --> 10:05.272
( moaning )

10:05.371 --> 10:06.807
Blech!

10:06.907 --> 10:09.542
We have to track down my nose
before some aliens snarfs it

10:09.643 --> 10:11.144
and does The Worm. Who's in?

10:11.244 --> 10:14.114
Me and Bender
and maybe Zoidberg
if he feels like it.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.514
Nah, I'm good.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.825
( crowd speaking
alien languages )

10:27.995 --> 10:31.030
Let's see.
I'll take a pancreas,
two sphincters

10:31.130 --> 10:32.231
and a large coke.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.167
One number three combo.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.568
( spit squeaking )

10:38.838 --> 10:40.006
It's no use.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.241
We've been to every
scuzzy bazaar
in the galaxy

10:42.341 --> 10:43.711
including Pottery Barn.

10:43.811 --> 10:44.912
Wait. What's that?

10:50.482 --> 10:52.351
Welcome, friends.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.520
How may I pervert you?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.155
Uh, I'm looking for human horn.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.725
Shh. You're
not cops, right?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.159
Of course not.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.394
In fact, he's a crook.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.996
Yep. Stolen Pez, anyone?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.668
Right this way.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.206
Human horn, so fresh

11:13.306 --> 11:17.210
you can still see
the eyeglass marks.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.446
Nope. Uh-uh.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.413
Ooh!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.082
Now, look, this is
the nose we want.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.517
Did you sell it to somebody?

11:24.616 --> 11:25.684
I'm sorry, sir

11:25.786 --> 11:29.188
but due to the perverted
nature of our business

11:29.288 --> 11:32.524
customer records are
strictly confidential.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.760
( groans )

11:33.860 --> 11:36.028
Right this way.

11:36.129 --> 11:39.365
I videotape everyone
who comes in here

11:39.466 --> 11:42.134
so I can blackmail
them later.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.602
( all exclaiming )

11:43.702 --> 11:45.705
Hey, I'm a porno-dealing
monster.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.774
What do I care what you think?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.243
Here's the weirdo
who bought your horn.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.046
( Leela gasps )

11:53.145 --> 11:56.249
That's Lrrr, ruler of the planet
Omicron Persei 8.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.118
You got any...
you know...?

11:58.217 --> 12:02.322
Speak up.
You're muttering.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.292
I said...
human horn?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.094
You're not a cop, right?

12:07.193 --> 12:09.461
Oh, no, no.
I'm just some guy...

12:09.562 --> 12:12.298
ruler of the planet
Omicron Persei 8!

12:24.576 --> 12:26.145
So let me get this straight.

12:26.245 --> 12:30.182
If I buy eight Caramello bars,
you all get to go to some camp?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.451
Yep. That's exactly
the lie we used

12:32.552 --> 12:33.986
to get past
your guards.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.288
Oh, great space king

12:35.388 --> 12:37.924
I humbly beg you
to return my human horn.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.927
What... human horn?

12:40.027 --> 12:41.461
How ridiculous.

12:41.561 --> 12:45.032
Why would a virile male
like Lrrr need human horn?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.834
I don't even know
what it's for.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.601
What is it?
Something you put
in salad dressing?

12:49.701 --> 12:51.337
Like you've ever
seen a salad.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.673
My weight is appropriate
and attractive.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.475
Whoa, you guys
have issues.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.510
She has issues. I'm fine.

12:58.610 --> 13:01.380
But there's no human horn
around here

13:01.480 --> 13:03.316
so make friends with the door.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.985
All right, I give up.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.554
I guess I'll just go home
and marry a skunk.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.289
( sobbing )

13:10.389 --> 13:11.859
Oh, let's just give it to him.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.893
Here.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.662
My nose! Light of my face!

13:15.761 --> 13:17.129
Uh, what is that?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.399
How do you have
that, Ndnd?

13:19.499 --> 13:20.967
I've never seen it before.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.469
My friend left it here.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.304
Hold still, Fry.

13:25.404 --> 13:28.008
I can reattach it
with my emergency face laser.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.043
( tone )

13:30.143 --> 13:32.578
Hey, you burned my cheek!

13:32.678 --> 13:34.847
Yeah, sorry.
I wasn't really concentrating.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.517
No, I mean the singed flesh--
I can smell it.

13:37.616 --> 13:38.485
( sniffs )

13:38.585 --> 13:40.552
And those lilacs
on the table.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.188
At least someone noticed.

13:42.288 --> 13:44.857
For the last time,
I don't like lilacs!

13:44.957 --> 13:47.494
Your first wife was the one
who liked lilacs.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.096
She also liked to shut up.

13:49.196 --> 13:49.996
Well, great seeing you.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.163
I guess we'll be on our...

13:51.264 --> 13:52.231
Yo, Highness!

13:52.331 --> 13:53.866
Just out of robo curiosity

13:53.966 --> 13:57.070
why would you use a guy's nose
for an aphrodisiac

13:57.169 --> 13:59.907
instead of his, you know,
wing-dang doodle?

14:00.039 --> 14:03.676
But I thought the horn
was the human wing-dang doodle.

14:03.775 --> 14:05.111
No, sir, Chief.

14:05.211 --> 14:08.181
The main event-- so to speak--
is downstairs, near the wallet.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.217
You ever see soccer players
line up to block a free kick?

14:11.317 --> 14:14.287
They ain't covering
their noses, I'll
tell you that much.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.355
Well, see you.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.556
Interesting.

14:16.655 --> 14:20.293
The trousers conceal a tiny,
secondary horn.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.360
Hey, what've you heard?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.763
Guards, seize him!

14:23.863 --> 14:27.067
Prepare to harvest
the lower horn.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.072
Okay, you can have my nose.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.479
( whimpering )

14:39.578 --> 14:40.379
Guards!

14:40.480 --> 14:41.413
Yeah?

14:41.514 --> 14:43.149
Remove the human's
lower horn

14:43.250 --> 14:45.485
and prepare it to
be eaten by me.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.254
In other words, slop a lot
of ketchup and salt on it.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.256
Then bring it to our
royal bed chamber

14:50.356 --> 14:52.993
and put it in a sock
drawer with all the
other things

14:53.092 --> 14:55.761
that have failed to arouse
my passion for this woman.

14:55.861 --> 14:59.265
( whirring )

14:59.365 --> 15:01.000
Remove pants.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.601
Wait... listen.

15:02.701 --> 15:05.304
I'm usually the first guy to
toot my own lower horn, but...

15:05.404 --> 15:06.773
I'll say. Whoo!

15:06.873 --> 15:08.475
But in this case,
I just don't think

15:08.575 --> 15:09.676
it's going to do any good.

15:09.775 --> 15:13.312
That's what she said. Whoo!

15:13.413 --> 15:16.283
Let's face it, you two have
deep relationship problems

15:16.383 --> 15:18.418
that can't be solved
by an aphrodisiac.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.918
However huge it might be.

15:20.019 --> 15:23.322
So what do you suggest,
painfully single human?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.823
Well, why don't you think back

15:24.923 --> 15:27.259
to what brought you together
in the first place.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.162
Oh, I don't know.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.198
Lrrr used to be so tender.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.534
Oh, I only wrote that
poem to test my printer.

15:35.634 --> 15:37.169
We'd go walking in the woods

15:37.269 --> 15:39.838
and Lrrr would find
injured little tinklebunnies

15:39.938 --> 15:41.640
and nurse them back to health.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.842
Yes, but I'm the one
who injured them.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.445
Oh, shush.

15:45.544 --> 15:48.780
You stepped on them by accident
and then you cried all night.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.484
That's the kind of sensitive man
you used to be.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.952
And you used to wear
a size three cape

15:54.053 --> 15:55.355
but not anymore.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.557
Now bring me that lower horn
while I'm still in the mood.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.126
( whirring )

16:00.226 --> 16:01.293
B-but w-w-what if we

16:01.394 --> 16:02.828
helped you get your passion back

16:02.928 --> 16:04.530
without the hassle
of mutilating me?

16:04.630 --> 16:06.966
Yeah. We know a great place
in the mountains.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.168
We could take
you there

16:08.268 --> 16:10.169
for a romantic dinner
under the stars.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.639
Hmm. Sounds interesting.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.006
But he would never do it.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.375
Oh, like hell I wouldn't.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.677
I'm not going to be
blamed for not going.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.711
Then it's a deal.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.846
We get one night.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.514
I keep my horn
as long as you two

16:21.614 --> 16:23.682
end up doing
the horizontal Monster Mash.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.652
( laughing )

16:25.751 --> 16:28.721
Oh... I don't get it.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.663
Bonjour. May I offer you
a box of wine

16:36.763 --> 16:38.664
for the edge of the table?

16:38.764 --> 16:39.665
No, thanks.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.334
Just water, please.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.335
Tap water.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.003
Oh... big spender.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.238
That's it!

16:45.337 --> 16:47.240
This date is over!

16:47.340 --> 16:48.674
Waiter!

16:48.774 --> 16:51.077
So, what can I get
you this evening?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.511
Your lower horn!

16:52.611 --> 16:53.846
( yelps )

16:53.946 --> 16:56.115
Uh, I'll just start you off
with some bread--

16:56.216 --> 16:57.549
some sexy, arousing bread.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.452
Fine, but none of that
whole-grain goat food.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.621
And bring plenty
of melted butter!

17:02.721 --> 17:06.858
Ugh. Why don't you just inject
some fat straight into your ass

17:06.959 --> 17:08.627
and cut out the middleman?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.530
One of these days,
Ndnd... Bang! Zoom!

17:11.631 --> 17:15.134
Straight to the third moon
of Omicron Persei 8!

17:17.569 --> 17:21.441
( loud eating )

17:21.540 --> 17:24.111
Mmm. This jerked chicken
is good.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.579
I think I'll have Fry's
lower horn jerked.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.083
BENDER:
It's used to it! Whoo!

17:30.182 --> 17:31.483
( wheels squeaking )

17:31.584 --> 17:34.221
So, uh, how are you two
snoogie-pookums doing?

17:34.320 --> 17:35.221
Poorly!

17:35.322 --> 17:37.156
My wife is right, for once.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.826
There's very little magic
in the air.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.827
Ready the lower horn
transport vessel.

17:44.963 --> 17:45.897
( screams )

17:45.998 --> 17:47.500
Boy, who knew a cooler

17:47.599 --> 17:50.001
could also make
a handy wang coffin.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.172
Mind if I stick these in here?

17:52.271 --> 17:53.005
Go for it.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.741
Don't worry, Fry.

17:55.842 --> 17:56.776
Things look bad

17:56.875 --> 17:58.911
but I still have
a trump card...

17:59.010 --> 18:01.780
the most beautiful love
song ever written.

18:01.881 --> 18:10.423
* And I...
will always love you, ooh... *

18:10.522 --> 18:14.693
( groans and screams )

18:14.794 --> 18:16.328
The humans are attacking!

18:16.429 --> 18:19.298
Pluck the lower horn
and let's get out of here!

18:19.398 --> 18:22.000
Quick, Fry, run for it.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.170
( grunts )

18:24.203 --> 18:25.438
( wheels squeaking )

18:25.538 --> 18:26.838
( grunts )

18:26.939 --> 18:29.842
Come on, freedom cage,
roll me to safety.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.486
Yes! I never thought
I'd escape with my doodle

18:39.586 --> 18:40.952
but I pulled it out.

18:41.052 --> 18:43.855
BENDER:
Just like
at the movie theater. Whoo!

18:43.955 --> 18:45.224
Give me that.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.393
( screams )

19:00.507 --> 19:03.643
( loud growl
and thundering footsteps )

19:06.512 --> 19:07.846
Bigfoot!

19:07.946 --> 19:09.316
He's real. I knew it!

19:09.415 --> 19:11.518
The Loch Ness Monster's book
was right.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.856
( grunting )

19:17.957 --> 19:21.928
Well, hello there,
my furry friend.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.830
Look at his adorable
little feet.

19:26.031 --> 19:28.701
( growls ferociously )

19:32.171 --> 19:34.173
( chuckles lovingly )

19:34.273 --> 19:36.776
Yes, you are a cutie pie.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.611
Holy macaroni!

19:40.346 --> 19:42.781
I can't believe
I'm seeing Bigfoot.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.182
And he's in focus.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.853
Oh, I've waited my entire life
for this moment.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.855
ALL:
Huh? What?

19:49.955 --> 19:51.391
Hey, what are you
doing with that?

19:51.490 --> 19:54.727
You're going to kill
this innocent giganto?

19:54.826 --> 19:55.961
Of course not.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.797
I'm just going
to tranquilize him

19:57.896 --> 20:00.299
so I can chop off his feet
as proof he exists

20:00.400 --> 20:02.101
then dump him back in the wild.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.303
He'll do fine.

20:03.403 --> 20:07.205
You'll have to get
through me first.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.308
Okay. Nightie-night.

20:11.943 --> 20:13.313
Hey.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.982
Now leave this gentle Sasquatch,
or wood ape, in peace

20:17.083 --> 20:19.419
so I can finally
and at long last

20:19.519 --> 20:23.055
harvest this pathetic human's
lower horn.

20:23.154 --> 20:24.457
Yeah! ( gasps )

20:24.557 --> 20:26.157
Wait, what am I saying?

20:26.259 --> 20:28.560
If I poach
this beast's lower horn

20:28.661 --> 20:32.999
am I any better than that ranger
with his demented foot lust?

20:33.098 --> 20:35.734
Yes, but not by enough.

20:37.636 --> 20:38.938
Score.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.339
( growls softly )

20:40.440 --> 20:44.310
This human's lower horn
is one of God's creatures--

20:44.411 --> 20:45.612
a living thing.

20:45.711 --> 20:49.080
And all living things,
large and small...

20:49.181 --> 20:51.951
BENDER:
In this case, small. Whoo!

20:52.050 --> 20:56.489
Have dignity
and a spark of the divine.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.990
( crying )

20:59.090 --> 21:02.429
That's the gentle,
sensitive poet warlord

21:02.528 --> 21:04.195
I fell in love with.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.008
( passionate moaning )

21:20.112 --> 21:22.280
( clears throat )

21:22.382 --> 21:26.618
LRRR:
Uh, you'll want to retreat
to a safe 500-meter radius!

21:28.788 --> 21:32.659
Well, Fry, it looks
like you get to hold
on to your lower horn.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.861
As usual. Whoo!

21:34.961 --> 21:36.695
Run away!

21:36.796 --> 21:38.830
( moaning continues )

21:38.931 --> 21:41.567
LRRR:
Oh, yeah...

21:57.083 --> 21:58.518
ANNOUNCER:
You are on a scenic route

21:58.617 --> 22:01.921
through a state recreation area
known as the human mind.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.356
You ask a passerby
for directions

22:04.457 --> 22:06.858
only to find he has no face,
or something.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.327
Suddenly, up ahead,
a door in the road.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.832
You swerve, narrowly avoiding
The Scary Door.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.069
I have combined the DNA
of the world's most evil animals

22:18.170 --> 22:20.740
to make the most evil creature
of them all.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.011
It turns out it's man.
