WEBVTT

00:02.166 --> 00:04.166
OK, I think
we lost Alex

00:04.166 --> 00:05.708
by the Shakespeare
in the Park performance.

00:05.708 --> 00:07.875
Yeah, she's probably
still yelling at Hamlet:

00:07.875 --> 00:09.458
"Yo, Ham-ster!

00:09.458 --> 00:11.750
Methinks there's a wedgie
in thy tights!"

00:13.708 --> 00:16.333
Harper, I really wanted this
to be a special day

00:16.333 --> 00:19.625
for just us and, once again,
Alex tagged along.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.125
I'm sorry, Zeke.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.416
Ever since she broke up with
Mason, she's been so clingy,

00:23.416 --> 00:25.833
like one of those dryer sheets
that falls out of your pant leg

00:25.833 --> 00:27.500
at the most
embarrassing moments.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.750
That's a great
comparison. What made
you think of that?

00:30.750 --> 00:33.833
There's one peeking out
of your pant leg right now.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.708
Oh, so embarrassing!

00:37.375 --> 00:39.583
- Good thing we're alone.
- Yeah.

00:39.583 --> 00:44.250
- Hey... we're alone.
- That's right.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.375
There you guys are.

00:47.375 --> 00:51.458
Ooh, you were about
to smooch it up, weren't you?

00:51.458 --> 00:53.875
All right, I'll leave you alone
for a little bit.

00:56.875 --> 00:58.708
Are you done now?

01:02.625 --> 01:03.750
Now?

01:05.250 --> 01:07.291
- Are you guys done now?
- We're done!

01:07.291 --> 01:10.833
Good.

01:10.833 --> 01:12.458
All right.
So what are we gonna do

01:12.458 --> 01:13.875
to keep this party rolling?

01:13.875 --> 01:16.125
You know, we were just saying
it's been a long day.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.625
We are... We are beat.

01:17.625 --> 01:21.375
Harper's right. Yawn.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.875
Oh, no, no, come on.
We're having way too much fun

01:23.875 --> 01:25.375
to stop now and be by ourselves.

01:25.375 --> 01:28.291
Sorry, Alex. Why don't you
just go on without us?

01:28.291 --> 01:30.416
We're too tired
to walk anywhere, anyway.

01:30.416 --> 01:33.375
Well, who says
we have to walk?

01:34.708 --> 01:36.708
- All right...
- Let's roll!

01:40.708 --> 01:46.625
♪ Everything is not
what it seems ♪

01:46.625 --> 01:48.833
♪ Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze ♪

01:48.833 --> 01:50.583

02:31.375 --> 02:33.000
No!

02:37.166 --> 02:40.000
Whoa, Dad's beating up
the calculator again.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.416
Multiply your
numbers now, punk!

02:45.708 --> 02:47.750
It's our worst month ever.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.458
You say that
every month, Dad.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.958
I know. It just keeps
getting worse.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.375
I think it's time
for desperate measures.

02:59.375 --> 03:02.583
You mean...
the Budget Binder?

03:02.583 --> 03:04.625
Yes.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.708
My moment has
finally arrived.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.750
This notebook contains a
lifetime of my groundbreaking,

03:15.750 --> 03:18.083
cost-cutting
business ideas.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.291
Let's open it up.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.125
"Throw away nothing."

03:26.125 --> 03:28.250
You throw away nothing.

03:30.458 --> 03:33.000
Like this used
ketchup packet.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.416
It's still half full.

03:34.416 --> 03:36.708
You fold it in half,
get a handy stapler,

03:36.708 --> 03:39.166
put it in here...
Brand new!

03:40.375 --> 03:42.833
That is a great idea, Justin!

03:42.833 --> 03:45.500
It's not me, Dad.
It's the binder.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.333
Well, I made the binder,
so it's kind of me.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.125
Hey, Dad, let me help.
I've got some ideas, too.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.208
Um... Not now, Max.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.458
Justin's kind of the
idea person in the family.

03:58.833 --> 04:01.000
So... So then what am I?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.708
You're a person
in the family.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.500
So you don't even
want to hear my ideas?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
Um... Maybe later, Max.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.875
All right, I'll go
tell myself my good ideas.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.500
Justin, I think
your binder

04:17.500 --> 04:20.375
is gonna save us
a lot of dough.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.958
"Dough" takes me
right to "bread."

04:24.375 --> 04:27.500
"Sell week-old rolls as
promotional hockey pucks."

04:31.833 --> 04:35.375
- Oh, he shoots, he scores!
- He scores!

04:43.208 --> 04:45.375
OK, I don't know where Alex is,

04:45.375 --> 04:47.250
- so let's make
a break for it.
- OK.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.750
There she is!
There she is!

04:56.458 --> 05:00.458
All right, two words:
game night, DVDs,

05:00.458 --> 05:03.958
and bags of crunchy things,
coated in cheese dust.

05:03.958 --> 05:06.333
And then afterwards, we can
wipe our fingers on the couch.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.958
It's great having
an orange couch.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.625
Two words? That's like,
a whole bunch of words.

05:11.625 --> 05:15.125
That add up to one word:
a fun, fun night.

05:17.458 --> 05:20.458
Alex,
we need to talk.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.291
OK, this isn't
easy to say.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.250
These things
never are.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.166
It's just, lately,
Harper and I

05:29.166 --> 05:32.458
have kinda been feeling
like we need our space.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.458
Space? Oh, I'm sorry.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.750
Am I sitting too close
to you guys or something?

05:37.750 --> 05:39.166
No, Alex, that's not it.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.708
- It's not even you, it's us.
- It's us.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.958
Yeah, we should
take a break.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.458
Whoa.

05:47.458 --> 05:51.083
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No, we just think, maybe,

05:51.083 --> 05:53.875
it would be a good idea
if we just started seeing
other couples.

05:56.208 --> 05:58.416
- I see.
- And I mean, come on,

05:58.416 --> 06:00.583
it's not like we
won't be there for you.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.750
I know the break-up
with Mason has been really hard.

06:02.750 --> 06:06.458
Mason?
I am so over Mason.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.875
- Who's Mason?
- British guy, werewolf,

06:08.875 --> 06:10.708
- gets really hairy
when he's angry...
- I know who he is.

06:12.250 --> 06:15.083
Look, I'm fine.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.333
Why don't you guys go out
and spend some time alone?

06:18.333 --> 06:20.833
- You're sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:20.833 --> 06:22.708
I could use some "me" time.

06:22.708 --> 06:26.000
- Now, get out of here,
you crazy couple!
- Come on!

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Have fun!

06:45.875 --> 06:47.458
Justin, what are you doing?

06:47.458 --> 06:49.625
It's just another one
of my ideas to save money.

06:49.625 --> 06:53.875
So instead of buying
paper napkins, we have
one community napkin.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.291
Excuse me. Sir, would you...

06:58.291 --> 06:59.958
...like to wipe your mouth
before you leave?

06:59.958 --> 07:01.333
Thank you.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.000
Just one wipe, sir.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.833
Have a good day, sir.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.750
- That is a great idea, son.
- Aah!

07:17.750 --> 07:19.625
I see you're taking
advantage of our special

07:19.625 --> 07:22.166
"no-cup" discount
and community straw.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.958
That's enough, sir.
Have a good day.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.875
I just ran the receipts
for today,

07:38.875 --> 07:43.958
and your ideas have saved us
19 dollars and 32 cents!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.708
Bam! And that is
the power of the binder!

07:49.291 --> 07:51.833
Hey, Justin, I've got
something for your binder.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.625
This money is real.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.458
Where'd he get all this?

08:10.625 --> 08:14.583
Hello, hello, hello! Welcome to
the Wizardly Place Sub Station.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.625
Please speak clearly
into the dragon snout.

08:18.333 --> 08:22.583
All right, I have
eye of the newt club
and the lizard leg tenders.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.125
Would you care to
supernatural-size that?

08:25.958 --> 08:29.333
No problem, sir, pull
your magic carpet up to
the first window, please.

08:30.458 --> 08:32.708
Max, what is
going on here?

08:32.708 --> 08:36.125
Nothing. Just bringing in
new customers to help make
a little money.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.875
You opened up the Sub Station
to the wizard world?

08:46.875 --> 08:51.375
- Uh-huh.
- That's a great idea.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.500
No, it's not.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.500
I mean, it's
a good idea...

08:55.500 --> 08:58.083
...but I know how
to make it a great idea.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.375
Why limit yourself
to just drive-throughs?

09:01.375 --> 09:04.625
We could have
sit-down dining, too.

09:04.625 --> 09:08.000
I like it. We could
put a bunch of tables
and chairs in here

09:08.000 --> 09:09.833
and turn it into a dining room.

09:09.833 --> 09:12.500
But, Dad, I'm barely able
o handle the drive-through
as it is.

09:12.500 --> 09:16.000
- I mean, if we do that,
we're gonna need more help.
- No we don't.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.500
As I say
in the Budget Binder,

09:17.500 --> 09:20.583
"Never hire someone
to do something that
you can do yourself."

09:20.583 --> 09:23.875
You and I will wait the tables.
Dad, you can cook the food.

09:23.875 --> 09:27.125
- I can handle that.
- But, Dad.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.000
That's a lot more work
than we're used to.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.458
Max. Shh! This is
idea people talking.

09:34.458 --> 09:39.458
All right. I've got
a customer to handle, anyways.

09:42.166 --> 09:45.208
♪ Together forever ♪

09:45.208 --> 09:48.083
♪ Yeah, you broke up with me
over text message ♪

09:48.083 --> 09:50.708
♪ But you still want me back ♪

09:50.708 --> 09:54.250
Oh, give me a break.

09:54.250 --> 09:57.083
My drummer, Harper,
is with her boyfriend.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.458
I'm so bored
without you here, Harper.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.125
Maybe you can be here.

10:10.833 --> 10:13.416
Why be alone when you can
whip up a Harper clone?

10:17.166 --> 10:18.875
Hey, Harper,
wanna hang out?

10:18.875 --> 10:22.291
- Sure, Alex.
- Can you sit in on drums?

10:22.291 --> 10:24.000
Oh, I'd love to.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh, and I'll make popcorn
to throw at the TV when we lose.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.750
Oh, we're not gonna lose.
We're gonna own it.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.958
Hey, Alex, have you
seen my jacket?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.458
Who is your
fashion-forward friend?

10:43.583 --> 10:44.583
It's me!

10:48.958 --> 10:51.875
Harper, meet Harper.

11:04.583 --> 11:08.291
- Alex, you made a copy of me?
- It's gonna be fine, Harper.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.625
Fine?

11:09.625 --> 11:12.458
No, Clonie,
I was talking to Harper.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.708
You gotta watch
for the eye contact.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.583
Alex, You can't just
go around cloning people

11:18.583 --> 11:21.000
- without their permission.
- Well, uh...

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Well... you borrowed
my boots without asking.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.875
OK, those were footwear.
You borrowed a whole person!

11:29.958 --> 11:31.750
Oh, she doesn't like me.

11:32.708 --> 11:34.958
No, no, no,
I do like you.

11:34.958 --> 11:36.583
You're me!

11:36.583 --> 11:39.500
Look what you've made me do,
Alex. I've hurt my own feelings.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.708
I'm sorry I didn't ask
for your permission,

11:41.708 --> 11:44.250
but a clone is a perfect
solution to everything.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.583
Oh, and how do you figure that?

11:46.583 --> 11:49.000
This should be good.

11:50.833 --> 11:53.708
Well, you and Zeke have
more time to be a couple,

11:53.708 --> 11:57.875
and I get to still hang out
with you, my best friend.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.458
Hmm...

12:01.875 --> 12:04.708
Well, I guess I am flattered.

12:04.708 --> 12:07.250
My Harper-ness
is so in demand,

12:07.250 --> 12:10.166
it takes two Harpers
just to keep up.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.083
Plus, you could look
at yourself without a mirror.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.500
Spin it around, Clonie.

12:15.875 --> 12:20.166
- I am gorgeous!
- Oh, we really are.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.000
Hey, Alex.
Harper. Harper.

12:31.875 --> 12:35.833
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my gosh! OK!

12:35.833 --> 12:38.083
I'm freaking out right now, OK?

12:38.083 --> 12:41.083
Oh! There's two Harpers!
There's two...

12:47.083 --> 12:50.291
- And... boyfriend down.
- Yep.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.833
- Got my orders, Dad?
- Yes.

12:55.833 --> 12:58.875
Spicy cold-cut combo
for the human. Done.

12:58.875 --> 13:02.166
Dad, I need another order
of Munchkin Toe Chips.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.583
Oh, and here's
the community napkin.

13:05.416 --> 13:10.000
Two restaurants, one napkin...
How can we not make money?

13:17.583 --> 13:20.083
I know that breaking up with
Mason was the right thing,

13:20.083 --> 13:22.125
it's just that breakups
are hard, you know what I mean?

13:22.875 --> 13:24.458
Not really.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.708
You probably don't.
You're only a couple days old.

13:26.708 --> 13:27.708
But thanks for listening.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.208
- Hey, Harper.
- Hi, Harper.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.000
Hi, Alex. Hi... me.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.416
We have been having
the best day ever.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.708
You know that hot, new
discount shoe store downtown?

13:39.708 --> 13:41.500
Oh, Heels and Deals?
We've been talking about

13:41.500 --> 13:43.166
checking that place out
for months.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.958
Yeah, well now you
don't have to,
'cause I did it for you!

13:45.958 --> 13:48.708
It was awesome.
They had this really
funny salesman there.

13:48.708 --> 13:52.708
- Right, Clonie?
- Oh, Pierre. Best accent ever!

13:52.708 --> 13:54.958
"How are zee shoes, ladies?"

13:54.958 --> 13:58.958
We tried on,
like, 20 pairs without
buying anything.

13:58.958 --> 14:00.458
And then Pierre
kicked us out

14:00.458 --> 14:01.875
and swore at us
in French.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.375
- Oh, it was awesome.
- Yeah.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.625
Wow, it sounds like
I had fun.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.458
So how was
your day, Harper?

14:11.458 --> 14:14.000
Must've been nice to have
all the alone time with Zeke.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.083
Oh, yeah, we went shopping,
too. For dental floss.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.458
And he couldn't decide
between plain and minty.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.875
So we decided to do
more online research.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.750
Fun!

14:29.750 --> 14:32.125
OK, how brilliant
was this cloning idea?

14:32.125 --> 14:35.458
I don't mean to brag
or anything, but I'm,
like, the cloning queen.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.750
I think
that was bragging.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.458
OK, you don't have to
totally be like Harper.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.833
Well, I'm gonna see
if my dad wants anything

14:41.833 --> 14:43.625
from that place
that sells bacon cupcakes.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.583
Wait, you're going
to Oinkie's without me?

14:46.583 --> 14:48.708
But you said we were
going to do that together.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.208
More couple time for you
and Zeke. You're welcome.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.958
All right, you go have your
fun at Oinkie's, Clone Girl,

14:59.958 --> 15:02.416
but remember one thing:
I'm the original Harper.

15:02.416 --> 15:06.000
- You are just a cheap,
little knockoff.
- OK...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.750
And don't you even think about
being more fun than me,

15:08.750 --> 15:12.708
- 'cause I will take you down!
- You're scaring me.

15:12.708 --> 15:17.083
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I know all your little fears.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.583
All right, she's coming.
Now start laughing like
I said something funny.

15:31.166 --> 15:33.000
All right, so my dad
wants us to bring him back

15:33.000 --> 15:35.250
a bacon cupcake
wrapped in bacon.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.208
- Bye, Harper.
- All right.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.250
Have fun, Alex and me.

15:43.708 --> 15:46.625
Oh, joke's on her.

15:46.625 --> 15:49.416
That dress does not
look good from the back.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.708
My dress doesn't
look good from the back!

16:02.833 --> 16:04.583
- Dad, I need that tuna melt.
- All right.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.583
And where's my order, Dad?
I got a flying carpet mechanic
who's getting angry.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.416
- All right.
- My customers are
getting impatient!

16:10.416 --> 16:12.833
All right, all right,
I'm moving as fast as I can!

16:12.833 --> 16:16.250
All right? They're gonna
get everything I... Oh!

16:17.458 --> 16:20.291
What do they think, they
can just snap their fingers

16:20.291 --> 16:22.958
- and their food'll be ready?
- Pretty much. They're wizards.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.875
OK, sir, here's your order.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.583
One dragon melt,
extra-scaly!

16:33.583 --> 16:36.208
About time, kid. What, did you
have to slay the dragon first?

16:38.125 --> 16:41.125
Hey, this isn't a dragon melt!

16:41.125 --> 16:44.500
Smells like fish.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.208
Some of my best friends are
mermaids. I can't eat this.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.125
Here you go, ma'am.
Sorry for the wait.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.500
Finally.

16:54.500 --> 16:59.291
There's a lizard
in my tuna melt! Ugh!

17:01.333 --> 17:03.458
Can't you just eat around it?

17:08.708 --> 17:13.416
Dad! That tuna melt you
gave me was a dragon melt!

17:13.416 --> 17:15.458
- Did the lady notice?
- Of course!

17:15.458 --> 17:17.458
There was a little
dragon in her sandwich!

17:19.166 --> 17:20.875
Can't she just
eat around it?

17:22.833 --> 17:25.000
I tried that. She didn't
listen to reason.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.458
Now she's gone. Apparently
people don't like

17:29.458 --> 17:30.833
little dragons
in their sandwiches.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.000
Dad, you messed up
all my orders.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.208
All the wizard world customers
flashed out without tipping.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.583
- Everybody's gone?
- Yes!

17:40.583 --> 17:44.291
Wow. We ruined both restaurants.

17:45.958 --> 17:47.291
I'm sorry, Dad.

17:47.291 --> 17:48.750
I guess my wizard world
restaurant idea

17:48.750 --> 17:50.750
was too much for us to handle.

17:55.208 --> 17:59.166
No, Max.
Your idea was good.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.083
And it was working
until we came along,

18:01.083 --> 18:02.875
got greedy,
and ruined it.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.583
Dad, stop. He's gonna think we
want to hear things from him.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.208
Max, you have
things to say,

18:09.208 --> 18:12.958
and from now on,
we're gonna listen to you.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.125
All right.

18:15.125 --> 18:18.083
Well, I think one community
napkin is a health hazard,

18:18.083 --> 18:19.583
and can get us in trouble.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.500
That's totally ridiculous.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.125
The community napkin is a
revolutionary money-saver!

18:30.375 --> 18:32.750
Oh, Oinkie's
was so good, Clonie!

18:32.750 --> 18:35.000
I love how they weigh you
before and after you eat,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.708
so that they can
charge you by the pound.

18:36.708 --> 18:39.000
Oh, I love how
when you leave a tip,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.416
the counter guy
has to go...

18:40.416 --> 18:42.000
"Oinkety oink, oink!"

18:43.708 --> 18:45.166
All right,
I'm gonna give my dad

18:45.166 --> 18:47.708
his bacon-wrapped
bacon cupcake.

18:47.708 --> 18:50.458
If you hear crying,
those are tears of joy.

18:50.458 --> 18:53.458
Or a heart attack.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.583
Hey, Harper. I just flossed.
I'm all "minty."

19:02.875 --> 19:06.000
Well, you know how I feel
about proper gum care.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.625
Zeke, what are you doing?
She's the clone!

19:10.625 --> 19:15.500
- Can't you tell?
- Yeah, sure, yeah. Of course.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.708
Kinda. No!

19:19.125 --> 19:21.291
Hey, could you guys
leave Clonie alone?

19:21.291 --> 19:22.833
We're about to do
some prank texting.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.958
Oh, shoot, I ruined it.
They were going to you.

19:24.958 --> 19:27.083
All right...
It was bad enough

19:27.083 --> 19:29.000
this clone you made
took away my best friend,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.458
but now she's trying
to steal my boyfriend!

19:31.458 --> 19:33.625
Harper, I don't know what
you're getting so upset about.

19:33.625 --> 19:35.625
She's probably just mad
'cause she knows I'm cuter.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.166
- Oh, whoa, no...
- Hey.

19:39.291 --> 19:42.125
All right, this is a very
unattractive side of myself.

19:42.125 --> 19:46.708
Harper, can't you share your
boyfriend with yourself?

19:48.458 --> 19:49.875
Plus, even if
I did kiss her,

19:49.875 --> 19:51.416
it's not like I'd be
kissing another girl.

19:51.416 --> 19:53.291
I'd still be
kissing you.

19:53.291 --> 19:56.500
Yeah, that is sort of how
this whole clone thing works.
I'll demonstrate...

19:56.500 --> 19:59.000
Oh, whoa, no.
You back off, Clonezilla!

19:59.000 --> 20:01.583
Alex, we gotta
get rid of her!

20:02.416 --> 20:04.208
OK, OK.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.083
Alex, what's wrong?
Just do it!

20:14.166 --> 20:16.958
- I can't.
- And why not?

20:18.583 --> 20:21.583
Because... I broke up
with my boyfriend,

20:21.583 --> 20:23.208
and I needed
my best friend.

20:24.708 --> 20:28.000
- This clone is all I have.
- Well, I'm your best friend.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.458
Oh, my gosh.

20:32.958 --> 20:35.291
I'm your best friend,
and I wasn't there for you.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.083
I just wanted
to hang out with Zeke.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.000
- I'm so sorry, Alex.
- It's OK.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.708
It's not right for me
to come in-between
you and your boyfriend

20:44.708 --> 20:46.583
just 'cause
I don't have one.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.958
I'm sorry, too.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.458
So am I supposed to go
with the clone now? Or...

20:56.458 --> 20:59.708
No! We are
getting rid of her.

20:59.708 --> 21:02.416
Well, why me?
Why not her?

21:02.416 --> 21:04.250
I was the nicest one here.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.583
- Alex!
- I'm on it.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.208
Hit the road, clone,
we want to be alone!

21:11.875 --> 21:15.458
I guess you guys are gonna
want some best friend time,
so I'll just...

21:16.583 --> 21:18.458
- No, wait, Zeke.
- I can stay?

21:20.125 --> 21:22.750
No, you have a dryer sheet
sticking out of your pant leg.

21:22.750 --> 21:26.083
Oh, my gosh!
So embarrassing!

21:37.708 --> 21:41.708
OK, Clonie, do not tell Harper
that I brought you back,

21:41.708 --> 21:45.750
but I need you to help me
do something very,
very important.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.291
Well, anything, Alex.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.875
I need you to help me
beat my high score. Go!

21:53.500 --> 21:56.083
♪ Together forever ♪

21:56.083 --> 21:59.458
♪ You broke up with me
over text message ♪

22:02.583 --> 22:03.583
Hey, Alex.

22:06.166 --> 22:07.500
What is she doing here?

22:10.291 --> 22:11.291
See you in PE!

22:12.500 --> 22:14.583
Oh, I know where you hide.
Come here!
