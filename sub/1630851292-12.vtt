Oh, it's a letter from
my fancy private high school.

00:40.432 --> 00:41.582
(barking)

00:43.360 --> 00:45.285
(growling)

00:46.363 --> 00:48.772
I'll take this envelope
to the refuse, madam.

00:48.865 --> 00:51.175
Oh, thank you, letter butler.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.202
-What's that all about?
-Oh, it's an invitation

00:54.296 --> 00:55.779
to my high school reunion.

00:55.872 --> 00:58.873
I went to the Fancington's
Academy for Insufferable Girls.

00:58.967 --> 01:02.210
Our mascot was a well-dressed
woman who yells at valets.

01:02.304 --> 01:05.213
Nice. I'm sure you and Peter
will have a great time.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.139
Uh...

01:06.292 --> 01:08.275
(sharp inhale) Peter.

01:10.738 --> 01:14.073
Nobody look.
This is a private, gross matter.

01:19.305 --> 01:20.320
Right.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.472
Do people bring husbands
to these things?

01:22.566 --> 01:24.641
You're not thinking of going
without him, are you?

01:24.734 --> 01:27.419
Honestly, Brian,
these girls come from old money,

01:27.496 --> 01:30.647
so they can be pretty stuffy
and judgmental.

01:30.666 --> 01:32.816
Well...

01:32.818 --> 01:35.969
I'm still available.

01:41.251 --> 01:44.845
"But the real outliers were the
friends we made along the way."

01:44.997 --> 01:47.255
-The end.
-(door opens)

01:47.274 --> 01:49.274
-Oh, hey, Lois.
-Wow, look at you.

01:49.501 --> 01:51.276
-Reading a book, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

01:51.503 --> 01:53.170
I read everything
people leave on planes.

01:53.263 --> 01:54.780
I read<i> The Da Vinci Code</i>
four times.

01:55.007 --> 01:57.932
And I'm not sure the last time
I've seen you in your uniform.

01:58.026 --> 02:00.410
You really clean up nice.

02:02.698 --> 02:05.682
Hey, Glenn, I have this
class reunion coming up soon,

02:05.701 --> 02:09.444
and I thought maybe it'd be fun
if, I don't know,

02:09.521 --> 02:12.280
you know, maybe the two of us
went together.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.617
-What about Peter?
-Oh, he hates those things.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.252
And football.

02:18.455 --> 02:20.955
-Climate change?
-Well, that is a real problem.

02:21.049 --> 02:23.049
Hey, here's a fun thought:
what if you go

02:23.202 --> 02:25.051
and pretend to be my husband?

02:25.204 --> 02:27.462
Well, I'm not used to wearing
rings above the waist,

02:27.665 --> 02:30.440
but what the hell--
I'll try anything once.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.047
Where you going, Mom?

02:37.065 --> 02:39.383
Oh, I'm just heading out
for the weekend

02:39.551 --> 02:41.051
to visit the...

02:41.069 --> 02:43.811
Museum of Dusty Vases.

02:43.873 --> 02:46.406
Why don't you just look
at all the ones in this house?

02:46.558 --> 02:48.983
So what do we do for dinner?
Like, pizza?

02:49.077 --> 02:51.653
-No pizza.
-Okay, right. So, like, pizza?

02:51.747 --> 02:53.488
No, Peter, not pizza.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.581
Okay, right. Not pizza.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.199
So just... pizza?

02:56.201 --> 02:58.844
Okay, everyone, I stocked
the fridge with healthy food.

02:59.071 --> 03:00.921
Your weight
is a reflection on me,

03:01.015 --> 03:02.664
so no pizza.

03:02.758 --> 03:04.516
Oh, pizza. Now, that's an idea.

03:04.743 --> 03:06.685
Peter, if you disobey me
about the pizza,

03:06.836 --> 03:08.261
there will be consequences.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.414
Mom's-out-of-town consequences,

03:10.507 --> 03:12.691
which, according to the movies,
are the worst kind.

03:12.842 --> 03:15.602
Fine, but I'm gonna tweet
mean stuff at celebrities

03:15.696 --> 03:18.071
that look vaguely like you.

03:30.193 --> 03:31.785
You're going to that reunion,
aren't you?

03:31.937 --> 03:33.453
Shh. Keep your voice down.

03:33.605 --> 03:36.698
Yes, I'm going,
but with Quagmire, not Peter.

03:36.792 --> 03:39.626
Glenn's gonna pretend to be
my husband to impress them.

03:39.778 --> 03:41.611
Are you sure that's a good idea?

03:41.705 --> 03:44.281
I mean, it's Quagmire--
you know how he feels about you.

03:44.299 --> 03:46.783
Yeah, I know he's gonna
try and sleep with me,

03:46.876 --> 03:48.285
but I'm a big girl,

03:48.378 --> 03:50.971
and I can handle Quagmire.
I'll be fine.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.789
-But...
-But nothing. Fetch!

03:52.882 --> 03:55.359
Oh, not cool, Lois.
Very not cool!

03:58.814 --> 03:59.980
All right, she's gone.

04:00.132 --> 04:02.699
Now, who wants pizza?

04:12.327 --> 04:15.420
Oh, no. No wife of mine
carries her own bags.

04:15.572 --> 04:16.588
(straining)

04:16.740 --> 04:17.739
Oh, my God, that's heavy.

04:17.833 --> 04:18.999
What's in these things?

04:19.093 --> 04:20.425
Well, we're here for two nights,

04:20.594 --> 04:23.244
so my hair dryer,
my iron, my free weights--

04:23.264 --> 04:25.413
and I thought maybe,
if I had a minute,

04:25.432 --> 04:26.448
I'd Rollerblade--

04:26.583 --> 04:28.583
my CPAP machine
and bedside table...

04:28.752 --> 04:29.935
There's a whole table in here?

04:30.162 --> 04:32.938
...travel Peloton,
every robe I've ever owned,

04:33.089 --> 04:34.940
and my desktop computer.

04:35.091 --> 04:36.850
It's got my email on there.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.944
Lois, I have
an umbilical hernia.

04:39.095 --> 04:41.196
-They're on rollers.
-Oh.

04:42.265 --> 04:43.931
Okay, so I booked us a suite

04:43.951 --> 04:46.026
so that we can keep up
the appearance of being married

04:46.120 --> 04:48.178
but still sleep
in separate rooms.

04:48.196 --> 04:50.289
Like John Krasinski
and Emily Blunt?

04:50.440 --> 04:51.665
Exactly.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.373
-(knocking)
-Oh, pizza man's here.

05:00.526 --> 05:02.092
Do I look okay?

05:03.170 --> 05:05.545
I know, that one
has a mind of its own.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.974
Here's your pie.
May I use your bathroom?

05:09.125 --> 05:11.143
Absolutely.
We'll be out here eating pizza

this is terrible.

is gonna find out we had pizza.

What the...

06:26.870 --> 06:29.036
This is not the room I reserved.

06:29.114 --> 06:30.614
This is the honeymoon suite.

06:30.707 --> 06:33.058
Was that, "This is
the honeymoon," comma, "sweet"?

06:33.227 --> 06:34.634
Or, like, "room"?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.323
Whoa, whoa,
I had nothing to do with this.

06:57.476 --> 06:59.309
-Then how did this happen?
-Well, I'm a platinum member

06:59.327 --> 07:00.810
at all the hotel chains,

07:00.829 --> 07:03.088
so they probably just
saw my name and upgraded us.

07:03.165 --> 07:05.148
Well, I don't know
if I'm comfortable with this.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.333
Oh, no problem.
Let me call the front desk

07:07.428 --> 07:09.911
and see if they can switch us
to a room with two beds.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.265
Ah, yes, we were wondering if we
might be able to switch rooms?

07:13.492 --> 07:14.749
Uh-huh. I see.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.327
So just a windowless single
with no water pressure?

07:17.420 --> 07:19.587
No, you know what, it's fine.
We're already here.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.831
My wife says, no, it's fine,
we're already here.

07:21.850 --> 07:24.776
(chuckles): Oh, you heard that.
Okay, thanks, anyway.

07:24.928 --> 07:26.336
But don't get any ideas,

07:26.354 --> 07:29.172
because nothing
is gonna happen between us.

07:29.265 --> 07:30.449
You have nothing to worry about.

07:30.676 --> 07:32.767
I'll be more of a gentleman
than John Wayne Bobbitt

07:32.861 --> 07:34.360

07:34.455 --> 07:36.680
Hey, honey,
would you take out the trash?

07:36.773 --> 07:38.665
Yes, yeah, absolutely.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.854
(panting)
Love it, love it. What else?

07:44.856 --> 07:47.632
Well, I have been dying to see
that new Rebel Wilson movie.

07:47.784 --> 07:49.801
I hear she raps, like, a lot.

07:50.028 --> 07:52.137
(sighs)

07:52.288 --> 07:54.598
Let's just do this.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.480
Okay, we have to get rid
of this body

08:01.631 --> 08:03.206
so your mom can't
connect us with the pizza.

08:03.299 --> 08:04.874
Anybody got any ideas?

08:04.893 --> 08:06.651
We could put a yarmulke on him

08:06.878 --> 08:08.135
a-and dump him
in the town square.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.821
Pretend it's a hate crime.

08:10.048 --> 08:11.990
Chris, come on.
Where we gonna get a yarmulke?

08:12.217 --> 08:14.159
We should float him
with balloons, like in<i> Up.</i>

08:14.310 --> 08:17.070
-Then he's the sky's problem.
-(electronic ding)

08:17.222 --> 08:19.814
-Oh, my God, he got a text.
-Brian, get it.

08:19.908 --> 08:23.710
I'm not fishing it out of his
pants, 'cause I'm into chicks.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.583
Oh, no. This means there
are still undelivered pizzas

08:30.736 --> 08:32.677
-in his car.
-The restaurant's gonna know

08:32.829 --> 08:35.572
ours was the last one he dropped
off before he disappeared.

08:35.665 --> 08:38.833
Oh, my God, that means
Mom will find out.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.094
Which means we got to deliver
the rest of his pizzas.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.580
And we'll leave him and his car
at the last stop.

08:43.673 --> 08:46.599
Well, if we're going in the car,
that means I can take the iPad.

08:46.752 --> 08:47.842
