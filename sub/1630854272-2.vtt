[Sig Hansen] <i>My father</i>
<i>never went by the rules.</i>

00:26.066 --> 00:27.266
<i>He followed his gut.</i>

00:29.767 --> 00:30.800
[birds squawking]

00:33.367 --> 00:34.767
[Sig] <i>In 1957...</i>

00:35.900 --> 00:38.042
<i>he was tired of being
a small-town fisherman.</i>

00:38.066 --> 00:39.100
<i>He wanted more.</i>

00:40.100 --> 00:41.467
<i>He wanted to be a highliner.</i>

00:42.767 --> 00:46.166
<i>Norway's herring fishery
was collapsing,</i>

00:46.266 --> 00:48.242
<i>but in America,
he saw opportunity.</i>

00:48.266 --> 00:49.600
<i>And he took it.</i>

00:51.967 --> 00:54.467
<i>I always admired his courage
to leave everything behind.</i>

00:56.567 --> 00:59.000
<i>He was ambitious,
and the timing was right...</i>

01:00.367 --> 01:02.167
<i>and if tonight goes
the way I want it to...</i>

01:03.800 --> 01:05.667
<i>it's my turn to make history.</i>

01:33.100 --> 01:34.867
[crew member]
<i>What have we got?</i>

01:34.967 --> 01:36.743
- [Clarke Pederson] Troll crab!
- [Lauritz Lekven] Troll crab!

01:36.767 --> 01:38.200
[Jarle Lund] <i>Troll crab!</i>

01:38.266 --> 01:40.100
[Sig] <i>Troll crab again.</i>

01:40.166 --> 01:41.966
[Mandy Hansen on phone]
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

01:42.367 --> 01:43.567
[Sig] <i>I dunno, Mandy,</i>

01:43.600 --> 01:45.567
<i>for 80 miles I've seen
this crab straight away,</i>

01:45.667 --> 01:48.300
<i>and I can't understand
why they're not fishing it,</i>

01:48.367 --> 01:50.567
<i>I don't understand why
there's not a market.</i>

01:53.767 --> 01:56.042
[Mandy] <i>Looks like they</i>
<i>tried to do something</i>
<i>about it in the 90s.</i>

01:56.066 --> 01:58.166
<i>Maybe there just wasn't
enough of 'em at the time.</i>

01:59.300 --> 02:00.343
[Sig] <i>Yeah, I dunno.</i>

02:00.367 --> 02:01.367
[Jake Anderson] <i>Pot's up!</i>

02:02.400 --> 02:04.266
One king, three trolls!

02:08.767 --> 02:11.166
Not seeing a lot of red crab!

02:11.266 --> 02:13.867
<i>Seeing a lot of troll crab.</i>

02:13.967 --> 02:16.087
[Sig] <i>You know, it's just,</i>
<i>I have a feeling in my gut.</i>

02:16.467 --> 02:17.500
[Mandy] <i>Follow your gut.</i>

02:22.367 --> 02:24.600
Okay, guys, come on in real
quick, would ya?

02:26.100 --> 02:27.266
[Jarle] Uh, come again?

02:28.367 --> 02:30.367
[Sig over radio]

02:32.400 --> 02:33.467
[Jake shouting] Now?

02:34.266 --> 02:35.567
[Sig shouting]
Yeah, right now!

02:37.767 --> 02:41.543
In 1958, when my
father started fishing
crab on Alaska,

02:41.567 --> 02:43.100
there was no formal fishery.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.500
<i>But there was crab.</i>

02:45.567 --> 02:48.543
<i>There was so much</i>
<i>crab they were crawling</i>
<i>on the beaches.</i>

02:48.567 --> 02:51.000
<i>He and a few other men</i>

02:51.066 --> 02:53.142
managed to turn that resource

02:53.166 --> 02:54.700
into a billion-dollar industry.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.367
<i>There's a resource here, too.</i>

02:59.700 --> 03:01.000
All right, so, here's the deal.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.700
Like it or not,
we're gonna head back in.

03:08.567 --> 03:11.700
If there's another species
out there that we can build
a market on,

03:11.767 --> 03:13.367
why wouldn't we?

03:13.467 --> 03:14.787
[Jake]
What are you trying to say?

03:16.100 --> 03:17.242
[Sig] I wanna get to the beach.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.443
I wanna do my own due diligence.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.667
I wanna go find out
what's going on.

03:23.467 --> 03:25.166
You just going by yourself?

03:25.266 --> 03:26.367
[Sig] You can handle this.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.943
You can fish king crab.

03:28.967 --> 03:31.207
The boat... you're gonna keep
the wheels spinning, right?

03:32.166 --> 03:33.367
- [Jake] Yeah.
- That's okay.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.767
I mean, right now,
we're participating
in a fishery,

03:35.867 --> 03:37.427
but, I mean,
if there's something there,

03:37.467 --> 03:39.543
we could be building a fishery.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.443
If it doesn't pan out,

03:41.467 --> 03:43.867
I can jump on the next trip,
that's not a problem.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.467
You gotta be
in this 100%, right?

03:51.467 --> 03:52.767
I'm glad you see it my way.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.066
[Jake] Or is it our way?

03:56.100 --> 03:57.142
[Sig] No, it's always my way.

03:57.166 --> 03:58.343
No, it's always our way.

03:58.367 --> 03:59.367
Now, it's our way.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.367
<i>I like that he's dreaming.</i>

04:04.000 --> 04:05.200
I do like that...

04:07.166 --> 04:08.646
but I don't like
that he's leaving.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.967
<i>I agree with it 100%...</i>

04:12.000 --> 04:13.767
<i>on a business level,
but, personally...</i>

04:15.166 --> 04:17.100
<i>I just feel more
comfortable having him here.</i>

04:27.000 --> 04:28.266
You ready to roll?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.567
Love you, [bleep]!

04:37.367 --> 04:38.400
Love you, too, brother!

04:39.367 --> 04:40.367
Be careful!

04:41.166 --> 04:43.500
Man, now I gotta
act like an adult.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.100
I've looked up to Sig
as a mentor,

04:47.166 --> 04:49.443
a captain, a father

04:49.467 --> 04:51.500
<i>since I was 25,</i>

04:51.567 --> 04:53.467
<i>but that's not the only
reason why I'm here.</i>

04:54.500 --> 04:57.000
<i>Mandy offered my 10%
stake in the business,</i>

04:57.066 --> 04:59.467
and I'll take whatever
troll I can get,

04:59.567 --> 05:01.647
but I'm telling you right now,
I'm here to hunt reds.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.300
All good, Jake.

05:08.567 --> 05:10.543
All right, guys,
let's get outta here.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.700
Feels like the first time
running a boat again.

05:13.767 --> 05:17.867
Just piloting a 193-foot
boat in Norway. No problem.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.600
Holy [bleep] <i>, here we go.</i>

05:27.467 --> 05:29.000
[Sig] <i>Whenever</i>
<i>there's a new fishery,</i>

05:29.066 --> 05:30.367
<i>there's always a learning curve.</i>

05:30.467 --> 05:31.547
With any mainstream market,

05:31.867 --> 05:34.367
before the, you know,
the masses knew about it,

05:34.467 --> 05:36.900
<i>the fishermen have already
had their hands on it, right?</i>

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
They're gonna be the people
that tell me the truth.

05:40.266 --> 05:42.667
<i>They will be the people
that tell me firsthand</i>

05:42.767 --> 05:44.767
what they see
and when they see it.

05:45.567 --> 05:46.600
<i>So, here's what I know,</i>

05:46.667 --> 05:49.567
in Norway, the fisherman
that catch these crab

05:49.667 --> 05:51.100
throw 'em back to the ocean.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.900
<i>There is no market
for these crab.</i>

05:53.567 --> 05:55.643
<i>There's gotta be a reason why.</i>

05:55.667 --> 05:57.800
<i>So, I mean, I figured
I'd just go to the source.</i>

05:57.867 --> 06:00.400
This is where they
process crab and fish.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.166
Halibut.

06:05.867 --> 06:06.834
Cod.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.066
<i>Well, I think
we're getting close.</i>

06:11.266 --> 06:14.100
Hey... it's Mandy,
Sig's daughter.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.667
I was just calling to see
if you knew anything about
troll crab?

06:18.667 --> 06:21.767
It's Mandy, I'll go get...
to give you a call.

06:21.867 --> 06:23.200
Our family has deep roots here.

06:23.266 --> 06:26.142
<i>Cousins, uncles,
Dad's old fishing buddies.</i>

06:26.166 --> 06:27.926
<i>A lot of the guys that
worked with my grandpa</i>

06:27.967 --> 06:30.367
<i>back in the 70s and 80s,
they retired here.</i>

06:30.467 --> 06:31.747
We're hoping
to fish it up north,

06:32.967 --> 06:35.100
is that possible? Do you
know anything about that?

06:35.166 --> 06:37.266
I appreciate your time.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.300
[Sig] <i>I'm off the Stalbas,</i>

06:40.367 --> 06:42.400
<i>and we're trying
to target troll crab.</i>

06:42.467 --> 06:44.266
Do they deliver much here?

06:44.367 --> 06:46.000
[female worker]

06:46.066 --> 06:48.100
[Sig] <i>So, you guys</i>
<i>don't process trolls?</i>

06:48.166 --> 06:49.200
[female worker]

06:53.767 --> 06:54.943
Uh-huh.

06:54.967 --> 06:56.567
Yeah, they are a little smaller.

07:00.467 --> 07:01.467
[Mandy] Hey! Glenn Tony!

07:02.667 --> 07:04.176
[Glenn Pedersen on phone]
<i>Hello, Mandy!</i>

07:04.200 --> 07:07.667
<i>I hear you're looking</i>
<i>for some information</i>
<i>about troll crab?</i>

07:07.767 --> 07:09.033
<i>I think we should meet.</i>

07:19.500 --> 07:22.767
[Sig] <i>Well, I'm on my way</i>
<i>to meet Glenn Tony Pedersen,</i>

07:22.867 --> 07:24.443
<i>he is my third cousin.</i>

07:24.467 --> 07:26.800
<i>His father, Dennis...</i>

07:26.867 --> 07:29.643
<i>was one of my father's,
Sverre's, best friends.</i>

07:29.667 --> 07:31.227
He's been around Norway
for a long time,

07:31.667 --> 07:32.967
<i>and he knows a lot of people.</i>

07:33.967 --> 07:37.100
Glenn Tony, we've known
each other all our lives.

07:37.166 --> 07:40.343
<i>Uh, raised a lot
of hell together as kids.</i>

07:40.367 --> 07:43.867
<i>We've fished in Alaska
together, uh, for a while,</i>

07:43.967 --> 07:47.343
and then he moved back
to Norway and we lost touch.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.700
<i>But he's been in the industry
here ever since.</i>

07:49.767 --> 07:51.800
- [Pedersen] <i>It's been a while.</i>
- [Sig] <i>I know!</i>

07:51.867 --> 07:53.867
Well, you picked a nice
spot, that's all I know.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.667
Yeah, it's a good place.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.800
[Sig] <i>Life's been turning</i>
<i>around a little bit?</i>

07:57.867 --> 08:01.000
Oh, yes, it has,
I had to, I had to.

08:01.066 --> 08:03.042
I was killing myself
with alcohol,

08:03.066 --> 08:05.100
and I had to find
a new lifestyle.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.100
You were always
a bad influence for me,

08:07.166 --> 08:08.266
you know that, right?

08:08.367 --> 08:11.600
Well, I don't know
who was the influencer.

08:11.667 --> 08:15.042
If it was you or me
or both of us, I don't know.

08:15.066 --> 08:16.700
[Sig] We were
the first guys in line

08:16.767 --> 08:18.743
when they opened
up the liquor store,
the first one here.

08:18.767 --> 08:19.667
Yeah, that's true.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.500
We couldn't have been
more than 17.

08:21.567 --> 08:22.544
Something like that.

08:22.568 --> 08:25.343
I remember because
my grandfather, he said,

08:25.367 --> 08:26.767
"have you seen the newspaper?"

08:26.867 --> 08:28.100
And I go, "what do you mean?"

08:28.133 --> 08:31.000
<i>And he puts it on the table,
and it's me and you</i>

08:31.667 --> 08:33.643
<i>- right in the front</i>
<i>of the line...</i>
- [Pederson laughing]

08:33.667 --> 08:35.543
at the opening
of the liquor store.

08:35.567 --> 08:36.867
Yeah, "where's our booze?"

08:36.967 --> 08:39.700
[laughing]

08:39.767 --> 08:42.943
He goes, "don't worry, I'm not
gonna tell your mother..."

08:42.967 --> 08:46.443
- [Pedersen laughing]
- and he just laughed
and laughed and laughed.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.042
[Pedersen] Well, my mother
didn't laugh.

08:48.066 --> 08:49.843
[laughing]

08:49.867 --> 08:52.042
Well, I've got a lot
on my mind lately,

08:52.066 --> 08:54.343
so, I'm glad you
could take the time.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.867
Well, I've heard some stories

08:55.967 --> 08:58.000
about you trying to get
something together here.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.266
Yeah, it's all about troll crab.

09:00.367 --> 09:02.967
Like, what do you know
about it because I'm just
learning as we go.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.500
I mean, uh, most people
haven't even seen one

09:06.567 --> 09:08.000
and they don't know what it is.

09:08.066 --> 09:10.467
[Sig] Maybe I'm barking
up the wrong tree,

09:10.567 --> 09:13.500
but I do know I like what I saw,

09:13.567 --> 09:15.500
I like the way they taste,

09:15.567 --> 09:17.567
and I just feel like
there's something there.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.467
[Pedersen] You gotta find
the right people that's
got a heart for this

09:20.567 --> 09:22.767
and really wants to market this.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.843
Can you produce a lot of crab?

09:26.867 --> 09:30.400
I always think we can do it
because I'm seeing 'em.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.147
[Pedersen] Well, I can
contact a few people

09:32.767 --> 09:35.100
that'll point me in the right
direction anyway.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.200
See what they think,
see if it's worth your time.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.644
[Sig] <i>It's not gonna be easy.</i>

09:41.668 --> 09:42.988
[Pedersen] <i>It's not</i>
<i>gonna be easy.</i>

09:49.200 --> 09:52.066
[Jake] <i>Honestly,</i>
I'm [bleep] <i>scared, dude.</i>

09:52.667 --> 09:53.800
<i>This boat is big.</i>

09:53.867 --> 09:56.800
The only thing
about this wheelhouse

09:56.867 --> 10:00.166
that is the same as the Saga
is the computer equipment.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.242
Jake's taking over running
the boat right now,

10:03.266 --> 10:05.367
<i>so, it's new for us,
new for him.</i>

10:10.300 --> 10:12.400
[Jake] In Norway,
the king crab are
hiding in fjords,

10:12.467 --> 10:14.900
but I can't get
in there legally.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.843
<i>So, I'm going down these
mountain sides,</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:20.667
and I'm trying to get
into the canyons

10:20.767 --> 10:22.600
and the gullies
and the trenches.

10:22.667 --> 10:23.843
I'm touching everything,

10:23.867 --> 10:27.100
I want my fingers to spread.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.407
[Jarle over radio] <i>Jake,</i>
<i>how deep are we going?</i>

10:31.367 --> 10:33.100
[Jake] Yeah, I'm looking
at it right now.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.600
Can you give me 120?

10:38.500 --> 10:39.667
Okay.

10:41.066 --> 10:42.643
[Jake] <i>The hard part</i>
<i>is it's a really big boat,</i>

10:42.667 --> 10:46.600
<i>and I'm trying to set
in these certain depths,</i>

10:46.667 --> 10:48.800
but the problem is we're
fishing in the mountains,

10:48.867 --> 10:50.900
so, it can change

10:51.000 --> 10:54.500
40 fathoms to 160
fathoms real quick.

10:54.567 --> 10:58.000
<i>So, I have to notify the crew
to add or take away</i>

10:58.567 --> 10:59.667
<i>600 feet of line.</i>

10:59.767 --> 11:01.000
So, I have to be very careful

11:02.066 --> 11:04.166
<i>that I keep control
of the vessel.</i>

11:07.100 --> 11:08.066
<i>I don't like it.</i>

11:08.100 --> 11:10.467
I might have put too
much line on this one.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.580
<i>I don't think I'm gonna make it.</i>

11:15.166 --> 11:19.000
Look, Jarle, let's go,
uh, 80 fathoms.

11:19.066 --> 11:22.000
[Jarle]

11:25.800 --> 11:28.242
We have to add a shot
or take off a shot.

11:28.266 --> 11:30.467
That's okay, as long
as we find crab.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.467
<i>You've got 80 fathoms
of line on the pot now.</i>

11:36.400 --> 11:37.467
Roger, thanks, Jarle.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.000
Throwing away!

11:47.467 --> 11:49.147
[Jake] <i>That makes me</i>
<i>feel pretty damn good.</i>

11:49.867 --> 11:51.667
That I'm setting pot in...

11:52.900 --> 11:53.900
Norway.

11:58.867 --> 12:01.000
<i>This is more than
just money to me.</i>

12:05.667 --> 12:07.467
<i>This is something
that I get to do</i>

12:07.567 --> 12:10.900
that my dad never would
ever [bleep] thought
I would ever do.

12:11.567 --> 12:12.567
Ever.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.943
So, I take this very
[bleep] seriously,

12:14.967 --> 12:17.543
<i>and the fact that I get to go</i>

12:17.567 --> 12:20.200
<i>to my family's home country,</i>

12:20.266 --> 12:22.300
and set [bleep]
king crab gear...

12:24.600 --> 12:27.100
it's [bleep] awesome, dude.

12:27.166 --> 12:30.100
<i>My father came from a long
line of herring seiners</i>

12:30.166 --> 12:31.166
<i>and halibut fisherman.</i>

12:32.367 --> 12:34.266
<i>He was always
proud of his heritage,</i>

12:34.367 --> 12:37.800
and always wanted me to come
and see where I came from.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.400
<i>He never got
the chance to fish here.</i>

12:40.200 --> 12:41.367
<i>But I do.</i>

12:42.367 --> 12:44.000
The biggest tragedy
is that he...

12:45.100 --> 12:46.500
he won't be here
to see me do it.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.266
[over radio] <i>Let's go</i>
<i>80 on this one, Jarle,</i>

12:52.367 --> 12:53.867
<i>80 fathoms.</i>

12:53.967 --> 12:56.567
Are you sure it's gonna
be 80 fathoms now?

12:56.667 --> 12:58.600
[Jake over radio]
<i>I'm pretty sure.</i>

12:58.667 --> 13:00.707
[Jarle] Well, then, we've got
80 fathoms on the pot.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.643
Roger, thanks, Jarle.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.100
[Jarle] I don't know
what the [bleep] he's
doing up there.

13:08.867 --> 13:10.543
[Jake] <i>All right, guys,</i>
<i>the sun's going down,</i>

13:10.567 --> 13:11.727
<i>but we're gonna keep pushing.</i>

13:19.767 --> 13:21.800
[Jarle]

13:23.567 --> 13:25.667
[Jake]

13:25.767 --> 13:28.266
I don't know what the [bleep]
going on with this pot, Jake.

13:28.367 --> 13:31.000
Just set the [bleep]
gear, Jarle, please.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.400
Roger that.

13:37.967 --> 13:39.266
It's back and forth, you know?

13:41.100 --> 13:43.166
[deck hand]

13:50.066 --> 13:51.100
It's a pain.

13:51.767 --> 13:54.967
Did you say go to 160 now?

13:55.567 --> 13:56.700
Are you listening?

13:57.400 --> 13:59.066
[over radio] <i>160 on that one.</i>

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Okay, guys!

14:02.767 --> 14:04.100
It's gonna be 60.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.100
- [Clarke] Roger!
- [Jarle] Yep.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.367
We gotta take one
shot off then, you know.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.100
This is the deepest
I've ever fished red crab,

14:14.166 --> 14:15.543
160 fathoms.

14:15.567 --> 14:16.767
[Jarle] Throwing away!

14:27.266 --> 14:28.266
Holy [bleep].

14:28.767 --> 14:30.042
[ship horn blasting]

14:30.066 --> 14:31.626
[Jake bleep] Don't set it,
don't set it!

14:34.266 --> 14:35.767
[bleep] <i>Can you get it?</i>

14:40.066 --> 14:41.467
[Jarle shouting]
<i>Throwing away!</i>

14:41.567 --> 14:42.567
[bleep]

14:43.000 --> 14:44.142
[ship horn blasting]

14:44.166 --> 14:45.567
[Jake bleep] Don't set it!

14:45.667 --> 14:46.567
<i>Don't set it!</i>

14:46.667 --> 14:48.467
[bleep]

14:48.567 --> 14:49.700
Can you get it?

14:49.767 --> 14:50.900
[bleep]

14:52.066 --> 14:53.400
[Clark] 60 fathoms?

14:53.467 --> 14:55.100
[Jake shouting] 160!

14:55.967 --> 14:57.166
One sixty!

14:59.066 --> 15:01.743
Jarle, it was 160.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.743
Not 60. We just lost that.

15:03.767 --> 15:05.100
[Jarle] What the [bleep], man!

15:06.467 --> 15:09.000
I can't turn around fast
enough to get it.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.166
You told us 60.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.867
Yeah, one six zero.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
[bleep]

15:17.166 --> 15:18.233
[bleep]

15:28.166 --> 15:29.943
<i>The only thing I can</i>
[bleep] <i>do right now</i>

15:29.967 --> 15:31.467
<i>is to keep this thing going</i>

15:31.567 --> 15:33.500
and try to make it a dollar.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.767
<i>I just hope my luck turns.</i>

15:52.000 --> 15:53.443
- [Mandy] <i>Lasse?</i>
- [Lasse Wangberg] <i>Yes!</i>

15:53.467 --> 15:54.400
[Mandy] <i>Yes! Mandy.</i>

15:54.467 --> 15:56.367
- Hey, Mandy.
- Nice to meet you in person.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.767
[Sig] <i>Nobody is marketing</i>
<i>troll crab to consumers,</i>

15:59.867 --> 16:02.100
so, if I'm gonna
try and fish it,

16:02.166 --> 16:04.343
I need to know
that I can sell it.

16:04.367 --> 16:06.767
[Wangberg] <i>What do</i>
<i>you want from us?</i>

16:06.867 --> 16:08.543
I was out here
fishing king crab,

16:08.567 --> 16:09.927
and, uh, you know,
but what I found

16:11.100 --> 16:12.543
was also troll crab,

16:12.567 --> 16:15.142
and I believe that we
can market that crab.

16:15.166 --> 16:18.443
I would like to see what
the customers think about it.

16:18.467 --> 16:19.467
Yeah.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.266
What do you think, Arne?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.943
Right, but you're going
off of rumors, okay?

16:38.967 --> 16:39.967
That's what you heard.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.776
You don't know until you try it,

16:41.800 --> 16:44.343
Just like I didn't know until
I went out fishing, you know
what I mean?

16:44.367 --> 16:47.343
It's comparable to a large
opilio, for example,

16:47.367 --> 16:51.042
and those sell all
over Asian market and US

16:51.066 --> 16:52.634
and all over the world,

16:52.667 --> 16:57.266
so, for me, I don't see
why you wouldn't be able
to sell the troll crab.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.200
In 1980, when king crab
crashed for the first time,

17:00.266 --> 17:03.042
it gave snow crab a shot.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.200
<i>Basically, the opilio
were trash.</i>

17:05.266 --> 17:06.600
<i>When you ran into them,</i>

17:06.667 --> 17:08.700
<i>it was a garbage pile
because you couldn't sell it.</i>

17:08.767 --> 17:11.048
It was unheard of, it wasn't
even in the supermarkets yet.

17:12.266 --> 17:16.700
One year, it went from zero
to 37 million pounds caught,

17:16.767 --> 17:19.743
<i>and that could happen here
if we play our cards right.</i>

17:19.767 --> 17:22.000
Yeah, what we're hoping
for if there's a possibility,

17:22.100 --> 17:24.166
that maybe we could do,
like, a one-night special,

17:24.266 --> 17:25.500
we'll supply the crab,

17:25.567 --> 17:29.367
you can put it on your menu
and see if it actually sells.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.743
Look, I've already
cooked this myself.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.667
It's got a very sweet taste,
very unique.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.743
I know crab,
this is my business.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.000
There's something there.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.767
Then you say, "I agree."

17:42.967 --> 17:44.000
Say it!

17:44.967 --> 17:46.176
- Yeah.
- [Wangberg] We have
to try it out.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.343
-[Arne Martinsen]
We have to try it out...
-[laughing]

17:48.367 --> 17:49.943
[Martinsen]
and see how it is.

17:49.967 --> 17:53.000
[Sig] You're supposed
to say, "Captain Sig,
[bleep] damn you're right."

17:53.100 --> 17:56.843
You never know what new
idea is around the corner
until you try.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.266
[Martinsen] Mmm.

17:58.367 --> 18:00.767
[Sig] And that's what
I wanna do with you
guys if you're open.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.400
All right. For one night.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.100
And see how it goes.

18:15.066 --> 18:16.943
No problem, if you
trust me to catch it,

18:16.967 --> 18:19.100
I trust you to cook it.
Fair enough?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.367
- [Wangberg] Of course.
- Okay.

18:31.867 --> 18:33.242
Hey, Sig.

18:33.266 --> 18:35.643
[Sig over phone]
<i>So, where are you now?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

18:35.667 --> 18:38.166
[Jake] I'm right at the head
of the fjord here.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.306
<i>We're hauling the first pot,
I'm a little bit leery.</i>

18:41.767 --> 18:44.900
All right, how about the crew,
are those guys doing okay

18:45.000 --> 18:48.943
or do I need to speak
a little loud Norwegian
to 'em?

18:48.967 --> 18:50.643
[Jake] <i>Everybody's doing good.</i>

18:50.667 --> 18:51.600
[chuckling] Okay.

18:51.667 --> 18:52.843
How's it going there?

18:52.867 --> 18:54.800
[Sig] We just got
an order for troll crab,

18:54.867 --> 18:56.200
so, I mean, it's big news.

18:56.266 --> 18:58.166
<i>I've talked to some owners,</i>

18:58.266 --> 19:00.867
<i>and they could probably sell
those for a pretty penny.</i>

19:00.967 --> 19:03.042
<i>I think we might be
on to something, you follow?</i>

19:03.066 --> 19:05.743
[Jake] <i>Yeah, my job is</i>
<i>just strictly to catch crab,</i>

19:05.767 --> 19:09.000
<i>but then it's your job
to figure out the rest.</i>

19:09.567 --> 19:11.667
The problem is
you're out fishing

19:11.767 --> 19:13.367
and the guys want the crab,

19:13.467 --> 19:15.133
<i>so, we're gonna have
to get another boat.</i>

19:16.467 --> 19:19.200
<i>I'll talk to you soon,</i>
<i>just keep doing what</i>
<i>you're doing, you know?</i>

19:19.266 --> 19:20.200
Yeah.

19:20.266 --> 19:21.667
- [Sig] <i>I'm out.</i>
- Roger!

19:32.767 --> 19:34.743
All right, guys,
these are for you.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.367
- One for you.
- I'm important.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.344
[Jake] One for you.

19:37.368 --> 19:39.000
Then we don't have to rely on...

19:40.066 --> 19:41.567
Jarle's 70-year-old ears.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.800
Yeah, that's right.

19:42.867 --> 19:44.142
[laughing]

19:44.166 --> 19:46.300
Yeah, and I don't
see any more either.

19:46.367 --> 19:48.100
[laughing]

19:53.600 --> 19:54.900
[sighing] Here we go.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.543
We're just gonna haul
our first string here
with Jake.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.500
Hopefully, it goes way
smoother than what
we started with Jake.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.000
<i>I think it's gonna be fine.</i>

20:05.066 --> 20:07.800
<i>We're out here,
we're gonna catch this crab.</i>

20:07.867 --> 20:09.707
This the first time I've
ran gear on this boat,

20:10.667 --> 20:12.567
and she doesn't
maneuver like mine.

20:16.967 --> 20:20.500
The current coming
out of the fjords is
running real hard.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.800
Clarke, I'm gonna run
a little wide on this.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.740
<i>Come on, come around,
come around, come around.</i>

20:29.767 --> 20:31.667
I'm going way too fast.

20:31.767 --> 20:32.900
<i>Going way too fast.</i>

20:35.900 --> 20:36.900
[bleep]

20:43.200 --> 20:44.543
[deckhand] It's far away.

20:44.567 --> 20:46.407
[Jake on radio] <i>All right,</i>
<i>let's back up on it.</i>

20:48.600 --> 20:49.967
[bleep], man.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.443
[Clark] <i>Hey, Jake,</i>
<i>it's floating back there.</i>

20:52.467 --> 20:54.743
I think we might be
floating over it.

20:54.767 --> 20:56.600
[bleep]

20:56.667 --> 20:58.743
[Jake] Hey, Clark, will you
run back on the port side?

20:58.767 --> 21:00.500
It's on, it's on
the port side, Clark.

21:05.266 --> 21:06.367
[shouts] You see it?

21:06.467 --> 21:08.000
It's just off your stern
right here.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.226
You're about to back over it.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.640
Take it out of gear, Jake.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.042
Get out of gear.
It's going to the wheel!

21:14.066 --> 21:15.667
Take it out of gear! [bleep]

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
[bleep]

21:27.000 --> 21:28.767
I'm gonna throw
the hook at it. Hold on.

21:39.467 --> 21:41.667
It's [bleep] wrapping
around the prop now.

21:43.367 --> 21:44.400
[bleep]

21:44.467 --> 21:46.567
[Clark] Get this slack
out by my foot.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.500
It's in the [bleep] wheel, man.

21:48.567 --> 21:51.100
<i>The Stalbas is not the Saga.</i>

21:51.166 --> 21:52.606
The Stalbas has
one engine, one prop.

21:54.367 --> 21:56.300
<i>If the line gets tangled
in the propeller,</i>

21:56.367 --> 21:57.400
<i>that's it.</i>

21:57.467 --> 21:58.767
<i>Getting towed back in.</i>

22:03.300 --> 22:06.142
- You got it?
- [Clark] Yeah, we're pulling.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.500
Should I try to put it in gear
and cut it?

22:08.567 --> 22:09.667
Throw it in reverse.

22:09.767 --> 22:10.767
Okay.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.100
I gotta try to chop
this pot off.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.100
<i>They've got tension
on the buoy bag.</i>

22:19.166 --> 22:21.000
I'm gonna jack it into reverse,

22:21.066 --> 22:22.346
<i>and hopefully, the prop cuts it.</i>

22:23.667 --> 22:24.767
Okay, Clark, you ready?

22:24.867 --> 22:26.400
I'm gonna jack it into gear now.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.043
[Clark] Yeah, roger.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.900
You're all secure.
Go ahead. Put it in gear.

22:33.867 --> 22:35.142
We okay?

22:35.166 --> 22:36.166
Keep going.

22:37.166 --> 22:38.000
[bleep]

22:38.100 --> 22:39.643
[Lauritz] Come on, baby!

22:39.667 --> 22:41.700
You're doing good. Keep going!

22:43.266 --> 22:44.467
Is it loose, Clark?

22:47.266 --> 22:48.266
I think that's it.

22:54.567 --> 22:56.000
We just pulled them up, Jake.

22:56.066 --> 22:57.643
They came up. The line's back.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.700
I think we're all good.

22:58.767 --> 22:59.767
[bleep]

23:01.867 --> 23:03.467
Oh, [bleep] me, dude.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.767
- So we got lucky.
- [Clark] Yeah.

23:10.967 --> 23:12.400
[Jake] Two [bleep] pots down.

23:13.867 --> 23:16.367
- Let's start heading
to the next one.
- [Clark] All right.

23:25.767 --> 23:26.767
Okay, here we go.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.166
[deckhand] Coming up!

23:38.000 --> 23:39.643
[Lauritz] No crab.

23:39.667 --> 23:41.867
[Jake on radio] <i>At least</i>
<i>we're getting into mud.</i>

23:44.767 --> 23:46.000
There's no crab,

23:46.066 --> 23:47.367
but there is a positive sign,

23:47.467 --> 23:49.166
that I'm seeing mud on the pot.

23:49.900 --> 23:52.000
<i>That means I'm in the area</i>

23:52.266 --> 23:54.500
<i>where I believe
that there's red king crab.</i>

23:55.667 --> 23:57.300
<i>When the currents run hard,</i>

23:57.367 --> 24:00.800
<i>this type of mud,
or glacial goo, as we call it,</i>

24:00.867 --> 24:03.743
<i>it's easy for the crab
to dig into and hold onto</i>

24:03.767 --> 24:04.900
<i>in strong tides.</i>

24:05.000 --> 24:06.567
<i>So now that the bottom's good,</i>

24:06.667 --> 24:08.943
<i>I'm pretty confident
in setting this gear.</i>

24:08.967 --> 24:12.367
Right now, I'm going
down these mountainsides

24:12.467 --> 24:14.743
and I'm gonna set down here,
where I think there's mud.

24:14.767 --> 24:17.367
<i>Yeah, Sig's got big ambitions.</i>

24:17.467 --> 24:18.667
<i>I don't fault him for that.</i>

24:19.467 --> 24:20.543
But if he can really do

24:20.567 --> 24:22.000
what he says
he's trying to do...

24:24.500 --> 24:26.367
that'll make us all
a lot of money.

24:26.467 --> 24:29.000
<i>But I gotta worry
about catching crab right now.</i>

24:29.867 --> 24:32.000
Set it when you're ready, Jarle.

24:32.066 --> 24:33.400
Okay, I'm coming over.

24:33.467 --> 24:34.467
Going over!

24:39.300 --> 24:40.400
[Jake] <i>Getting closer.</i>

24:55.100 --> 24:56.343
[Sig] <i>You know, if there's</i>
<i>money to be made,</i>

24:56.367 --> 24:58.000
<i>you gotta chase it,
you gotta go get it.</i>

24:58.100 --> 24:59.443
<i>It doesn't come to you.</i>

24:59.467 --> 25:00.667
<i>So, we'll see what we find.</i>

25:02.266 --> 25:04.146
- All right, Asgeir, you ready?
- [Asgeir] Yeah.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.166
200 kilograms is
not a big order,

25:08.266 --> 25:09.467
uh, definitely not enough

25:09.567 --> 25:12.667
<i>to pull the Stalbas
from hunting red king crab.</i>

25:12.767 --> 25:14.767
So I'm gonna have
to spend money to make money.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.443
- This one's RPM?
- [Asgeir] Yeah.

25:16.467 --> 25:18.867
- You have, you have the RPM.
- And this one is...

25:18.967 --> 25:21.500
- You see this...
- Yeah, where is the gauge?

25:21.567 --> 25:23.367
[Sig] <i>Asgeir Hoddevik, uh,</i>
<i>owns the Birgerson,</i>

25:24.567 --> 25:26.166
<i>and I met him last fall.</i>

25:26.266 --> 25:28.643
<i>His boat and crew are just
coming off of cod season,</i>

25:28.667 --> 25:31.142
and, uh, the advantage
I have with him

25:31.166 --> 25:33.667
<i>is that he can fish
inside the fjords legally,</i>

25:33.767 --> 25:35.166
<i>where the Stalbas can't.</i>

25:35.867 --> 25:36.867
Okay.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.000
That was the easy part.

25:40.066 --> 25:41.043
Here comes the hard part,

25:41.067 --> 25:42.200
find some crab.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.200
<i>We gotta set now...</i>

26:00.467 --> 26:02.242
<i>and kinda nerve-racking,
you know?</i>

26:02.266 --> 26:04.367
<i>It's a different boat,
different ballgame,</i>

26:04.467 --> 26:06.166
<i>different area,
different fishery.</i>

26:09.000 --> 26:11.042
So, just kinda head
towards the shore.

26:11.066 --> 26:12.567
How deep are we? This is...

26:13.166 --> 26:14.100
[Asgeir speaking]

26:14.166 --> 26:15.200
It's 25.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.100
Wow.

26:17.166 --> 26:18.867
I'm not used to that, man.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.000
I am not used to that.

26:26.767 --> 26:28.543
<i>And these are</i>
<i>the conical pots,</i>
<i>right, Asgeir?</i>

26:28.567 --> 26:30.100
[Asgeir] This is
the conical pot.

26:30.667 --> 26:31.867
Okay.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.266
<i>I've got conical pots on board.</i>

26:36.367 --> 26:37.700
I've never fished with them.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.042
They're smaller pots.

26:39.066 --> 26:41.166
<i>They're round, very lightweight.</i>

26:42.000 --> 26:43.700
We gotta give it a shot here.

26:49.266 --> 26:50.667
<i>Let's see here.</i>

26:50.767 --> 26:52.000
You guys ready?

26:52.166 --> 26:54.643
[Asgeir] Guys are ready,
waiting up.

26:54.667 --> 26:56.948
[Sig] We should be able to set
like this, don't you think?

27:01.200 --> 27:02.943
Ah, what? What?

27:02.967 --> 27:04.166
[shouts] What?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.142
[Asgeir] <i>Listen up!</i>

27:07.166 --> 27:10.200
I need you to check
the electricity. We're off!

27:10.867 --> 27:11.867
[deckhand] I'll go.

27:13.867 --> 27:15.467
[Sig] We've got a power outage.

27:16.867 --> 27:19.600
We got no power,
and the [bleep] damn beach
is right there!

27:20.467 --> 27:21.800
[beeping]

27:21.867 --> 27:23.187
[shouts] You know
what's going on?

27:24.467 --> 27:25.567
It's this one.

27:26.367 --> 27:27.567
It's not that one!

27:28.300 --> 27:29.500
[bleep]

27:32.467 --> 27:33.000
[beeping]

27:33.467 --> 27:34.947
[Sig shouts] You know
what's going on?

27:35.667 --> 27:36.967
It's this one!

27:37.000 --> 27:39.667
We got no power,
and the [bleep] damn beach
is right there!

27:41.100 --> 27:42.200
[bleep]

27:44.667 --> 27:46.467
Oh, we got light!

27:46.567 --> 27:48.367
[beeping]

27:53.367 --> 27:54.767
- [man] Asgeir.
- [Asgeir] Yeah.

27:54.867 --> 27:56.300
[man] What happened?

27:56.367 --> 28:00.200
[sighs] The generator breaker
went down.

28:00.967 --> 28:03.000
We have a rookie mechanic.

28:03.066 --> 28:05.266
<i>He was pushing
off the wrong breaker,</i>

28:05.367 --> 28:07.643
so they couldn't get
the power on, and it was...

28:07.667 --> 28:08.867
I don't know.

28:08.967 --> 28:12.266
It pisses me off
that he did that.

28:12.367 --> 28:14.166
<i>It could be very dangerous.</i>

28:14.266 --> 28:16.100
<i>Thank God we made it fix.</i>

28:19.266 --> 28:20.867
Everything should be working.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.000
Hydraulics...

28:22.667 --> 28:24.100
You got steering back.

28:24.166 --> 28:27.343
So what was it, anyway?
Generator? Hydros?

28:27.367 --> 28:30.667
It was just the breaker
on the generator
that fall down.

28:30.767 --> 28:31.843
- That's it.
- That's it.

28:31.867 --> 28:33.000
Well, what do you think?

28:33.367 --> 28:35.200
Can we just keep going
and get this finished?

28:35.266 --> 28:37.343
[Asgeir shouts] You guys
ready to continue?

28:37.367 --> 28:38.467
[deckhand] Yeah, roger!

28:39.166 --> 28:40.367
Okay. All right.

28:43.367 --> 28:44.900
<i>This is as good a place as any.</i>

28:46.266 --> 28:47.567
Okay, these guys are ready.

28:49.900 --> 28:50.967
Getting ready?

28:57.300 --> 28:58.243
We're right here.

28:58.267 --> 29:00.266
[Asgeir speaking]

29:00.367 --> 29:01.400
Yeah, it's gonna come up,

29:01.467 --> 29:03.000
so if I'm gonna set
right on this guy,

29:03.266 --> 29:05.367
that should be
30, 29 fathoms, I think.

29:05.467 --> 29:06.467
Okay?

29:07.166 --> 29:08.266
Does that work?

29:14.900 --> 29:17.100
We're gonna try
in this channel here now,

29:17.166 --> 29:19.443
<i>and work our way north
from there</i>

29:19.467 --> 29:21.800
and just see what we can do
with these things, you know?

29:27.800 --> 29:28.800
Ooh.

29:29.266 --> 29:31.200
Got one. First one's off.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.200
The reality is, we gotta
show that we can get
this crab quickly,

29:42.266 --> 29:44.166
because we've got
people waiting here.

29:51.767 --> 29:53.367
<i>Let's see what happens.</i>

30:02.266 --> 30:04.746
[Lauritz] <i>Well, the good thing</i>
<i>about not catching crab</i>
<i>right now</i>

30:04.967 --> 30:06.667
is we don't have
to pay a lot of taxes.

30:07.467 --> 30:09.000
I don't like paying taxes.

30:10.367 --> 30:12.567
Been a little bit more
comfortable driving the boat.

30:14.166 --> 30:16.967
Just gotta know
how she handles
and the timing.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.600
[Lauritz] <i>Coming up,</i>
<i>the first pot here.</i>

30:20.667 --> 30:23.500
I think we're gonna catch
some crab today.

30:23.567 --> 30:27.500
[Jake] <i>All right,</i>
<i>we're at the beginning</i>
<i>of this string that I set.</i>

30:27.567 --> 30:29.300
We're see how this pans out.

30:31.467 --> 30:33.000
[cell phone ringing]

30:34.300 --> 30:35.367
Lenny's calling.

30:36.767 --> 30:37.567
Hey, Lenny.

30:37.667 --> 30:39.166
[Lenny on phone] <i>Hey, Jake.</i>

30:39.266 --> 30:41.500
<i>Have you, have you seen
any crab yet?</i>

30:41.567 --> 30:43.200
It's too early to tell.

30:44.367 --> 30:46.500
[Lenny] <i>Market's really short</i>
<i>of crab right now,</i>

30:46.567 --> 30:48.142
<i>with, you know,
king crab season.</i>

30:48.166 --> 30:51.142
<i>I can try to help sell
some of this crab for you.</i>

30:51.166 --> 30:53.667
<i>Maybe I can even
get you a better price</i>

30:53.767 --> 30:56.100
<i>than you can get overseas there.</i>

30:58.367 --> 31:01.300
[Jake] <i>Do you think</i>
<i>I could get over, like,</i>
<i>10 bucks a pound?</i>

31:01.367 --> 31:03.087
[Lenny on phone] <i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>quite a bit more.</i>

31:03.567 --> 31:06.000
<i>Somewhere in the $20
to $30 range,</i>

31:06.100 --> 31:08.500
<i>- if the crab are right.</i>
- [mouths]

31:08.567 --> 31:11.943
Yeah, I don't wanna
get in touch with Sig
until I've found some life.

31:11.967 --> 31:13.943
<i>It would be stupid to argue it.</i>

31:13.967 --> 31:15.800
[Lenny] <i>Okay, Jake.</i>

31:15.867 --> 31:17.567
<i>Just keep me posted. Thanks.</i>

31:22.200 --> 31:23.467
Here it comes.

31:31.166 --> 31:32.166
Is it king crab?

31:32.567 --> 31:33.567
King crab!

31:33.767 --> 31:35.900
King crab, baby. [claps]

31:36.700 --> 31:38.300
Looks like five!

31:38.367 --> 31:39.367
[Jake shouts] Five?

31:40.300 --> 31:41.367
Right on!

31:43.300 --> 31:44.767
I never got a sight of them.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.567
King crab!

31:46.667 --> 31:48.743
<i>Oh, have I missed you.</i>

31:48.767 --> 31:53.000
I just caught my first
Norwegian red king crab.

31:53.066 --> 31:55.543
Finally, we got some crab here.

31:55.567 --> 31:57.000
[Jake] <i>I got a long way to go.</i>

31:58.266 --> 32:01.166
<i>Good news, I didn't lose
any more gear.</i>

32:08.467 --> 32:10.867
[Sig] <i>We're coming up</i>
<i>on our gear here,</i>

32:10.967 --> 32:13.800
and hopefully, uh, we can
see some crab in this pot.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.042
<i>200 kilograms, 450 pounds,</i>

32:17.066 --> 32:18.667
<i>well, it doesn't sound
like a lot,</i>

32:18.767 --> 32:21.042
<i>but if you're not hitting
the crab, sometimes it is.</i>

32:21.066 --> 32:24.643
I've pulled at least
200-plus pots, uh, empty

32:24.667 --> 32:25.734
before we found crab.

32:25.767 --> 32:28.343
It's not uncommon to see
half your gear not hit.

32:28.367 --> 32:29.467
[Sig on radio]

32:46.767 --> 32:48.266
<i>Well, they're pulling
on a capstan,</i>

32:48.367 --> 32:50.367
which is what they did
back in the day.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.667
<i>It is very old school.</i>

32:53.967 --> 32:56.100
<i>My goal of hitting
the $1 million mark</i>

32:56.166 --> 32:58.000
<i>is the same
as it always has been.</i>

32:58.066 --> 33:01.166
Just now, we have to include
a different fishery.

33:03.166 --> 33:04.600
<i>The risk is bigger,</i>

33:04.667 --> 33:07.166
but so could be
the potential upside.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.900
Everything hinges
on this string right now.

33:20.367 --> 33:21.407
<i>All right, here she comes.</i>

33:21.467 --> 33:22.667
<i>Coming up, coming up.</i>

33:23.600 --> 33:25.800
<i>Let's go. Let's see
some life, baby!</i>

33:27.800 --> 33:29.467
<i>Come on, now. Come on.</i>

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
[bell ringing]

33:44.467 --> 33:47.266
I consider myself
a traditional guy...

33:47.367 --> 33:49.567
- What are you guys doing?
- This is for you.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.743
So what are we doing here?

33:51.767 --> 33:53.800
- You're opening it.
- And eating it.

33:53.867 --> 33:56.867
And I've had my share
of biting the head
off a herring.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.242
[all chuckling]

34:00.266 --> 34:01.143
How... [sniffs]

34:01.167 --> 34:02.943
Oh, [bleep], that smells.

34:02.967 --> 34:06.400
But, uh, sometimes,
even tradition has its limits.

34:06.467 --> 34:08.567
- [laughing]
- What is this, piss?

34:08.667 --> 34:11.100
[Asgeir speaking]

34:11.166 --> 34:12.166
[deckhand speaking]

34:15.266 --> 34:16.100
[coughs]

34:16.166 --> 34:17.400
[retches]

34:17.467 --> 34:19.400
- Oh, that's awful.
- [deckhand laughs]

34:30.266 --> 34:31.100
[gags]

34:31.166 --> 34:32.266
Just shove it in.

34:32.367 --> 34:35.843
- [gags]
- [all laughing]

34:35.867 --> 34:38.747
- [Sig] <i>Honestly, the taste</i>
<i>was better than the smell.</i>
- [deckhand laughs]

34:45.500 --> 34:47.767
Everything hinges
on this string right now.

34:50.567 --> 34:53.042
<i>Let's go. Let's see
some life, baby!</i>

34:53.066 --> 34:54.967
Come on, now. Come on.

35:10.367 --> 35:11.367
[Sig] <i>Blank.</i>

35:13.066 --> 35:14.066
Zero?

35:16.567 --> 35:17.700
[bleep]

35:20.400 --> 35:21.467
<i>That's not gonna cut it.</i>

35:23.600 --> 35:24.667
<i>First one was blank.</i>

35:24.767 --> 35:25.667
<i>I need to do something here.</i>

35:25.767 --> 35:26.900
<i>I'm already out of time.</i>

35:29.200 --> 35:30.600
Come on, man.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.467
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

35:39.467 --> 35:40.467
[Sig] <i>Zero.</i>

35:41.166 --> 35:42.700
This is not working.

35:49.266 --> 35:50.266
Nothing in it.

35:51.166 --> 35:53.166
<i>There's zero
in that pot, too, so...</i>

35:54.266 --> 35:55.500
I don't know what to say.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.266
[deckhand speaking]

36:05.000 --> 36:06.467
We have crab!

36:07.100 --> 36:08.180
[Sig on radio] <i>We got crab?</i>

36:08.400 --> 36:09.767
Got crab!

36:09.867 --> 36:11.000
[all cheering]

36:11.867 --> 36:13.100
[Sig] There's one.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.567
There's a sign of life.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Two?

36:25.467 --> 36:26.467
That's a little better.

36:27.467 --> 36:28.500
We're gonna need more.

36:34.166 --> 36:35.446
[Sig] <i>There are four</i>
<i>in that one.</i>

36:36.000 --> 36:36.900
<i>And that's pretty good,</i>

36:37.000 --> 36:39.100
you know, for these little pots.

36:39.166 --> 36:41.000
[on radio] <i>Come on!</i>
<i>Big stuff, big money!</i>

36:44.567 --> 36:45.900
[deckhand] Whoo-hoo-hoo!

36:50.066 --> 36:51.800
That's pretty good.

36:51.867 --> 36:54.100
- [on radio] <i>I'm liking it.</i>
- Big number!

36:55.166 --> 36:56.643
[Sig] <i>We need</i>
<i>those 200 kilograms.</i>

36:56.667 --> 36:57.567
It's adding up.

36:57.667 --> 36:59.100
At least there's life
in the pots.

37:06.867 --> 37:08.600
1-5.15.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.943
<i>Awesome. Getting closer.</i>

37:10.967 --> 37:11.967
[deckhand] Whoo-hoo!

37:12.100 --> 37:14.100
[howls]

37:14.166 --> 37:15.800
We need to keep this momentum.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.100
That's how you fill an order.

37:17.867 --> 37:19.266
More crab!

37:20.100 --> 37:22.100
- Whoo-hoo!
- Let's drop down!

37:22.166 --> 37:23.567
[howls]

37:35.467 --> 37:36.667
Coming up!

37:37.667 --> 37:38.667
[Jake] <i>And here it comes.</i>

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
[deckhand] Oi!

37:41.767 --> 37:43.500
We got king crab!

37:43.567 --> 37:45.100
Yeah!

37:46.166 --> 37:48.100
[Lauritz] You knew it, Jake!

37:48.166 --> 37:49.867
- [Jake] Yeah!
- You knew it!

37:49.967 --> 37:53.100
- Oh, my God!
- [Lauritz laughs]

37:53.166 --> 37:55.543
[Jake] <i>I forgot</i>
what this [bleep] <i>felt like.</i>

37:55.567 --> 37:57.142
This is nice to see.

37:57.166 --> 37:58.500
[bleep], yeah!

38:00.367 --> 38:01.400
[laughs]

38:04.100 --> 38:05.867
[Jake on radio] [bleep]
<i>That's a nice pot.</i>

38:05.967 --> 38:08.242
I think we're gonna start
to make some money now.

38:08.266 --> 38:09.467
[Jake on radio] <i>Yeah!</i>

38:11.266 --> 38:13.567
Those are good crab.
I gotta call Lenny.

38:17.867 --> 38:19.400
[phone dialing]

38:19.467 --> 38:20.400
[Lenny on phone]

38:20.467 --> 38:22.667
I finally caught
some red king crab,

38:22.767 --> 38:23.744
and they're big.

38:23.768 --> 38:26.843
[Lenny on phone]

38:26.867 --> 38:28.500
[Jake] <i>5,000 pounds...</i>

38:28.567 --> 38:29.643
I think I can do it.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.400
I just have to talk to Sig.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.800
[Lenny on phone]

38:35.266 --> 38:37.500
[Jake] <i>Sounds like</i>
<i>Lenny's buyers are interested.</i>

38:38.867 --> 38:40.700
<i>So I gotta stay on this crab.</i>

38:40.767 --> 38:41.767
We got something!

38:42.066 --> 38:43.767
Reds, are they reds?

38:43.867 --> 38:45.100
[deckhand] Yeah, red king!

38:45.867 --> 38:46.900
[Jake] <i>Red king, baby.</i>

38:52.500 --> 38:55.300
<i>If my father was here right now,</i>

38:55.367 --> 38:58.266
<i>he'd be in tears to see his son</i>

38:58.367 --> 39:00.900
running a [bleep]
big-ass [bleep] boat...

39:01.867 --> 39:03.166
in [bleep] Norway.

39:04.867 --> 39:06.200
I'm not [bleep] you.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.000
<i>I feel pretty special.</i>

39:18.967 --> 39:20.567
[Sig] Nice and easy.

39:22.166 --> 39:24.142
<i>Okay, I gotta get
to this dinner.</i>

39:24.166 --> 39:25.367
Here we go.

39:26.300 --> 39:27.867
Well, Matty got
the truck for us.

39:27.967 --> 39:29.887
- That's awesome.
- [Asgeir] Then let's get them.

39:29.967 --> 39:32.443
- This should be
the last of it.
- [Asgeir] Yep.

39:32.467 --> 39:33.943
[Sig] With this,
we probably got just enough

39:33.967 --> 39:35.367
to fill the order, Asgeir.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.800
- You got it?
- [Asgeir] Got it.

39:37.867 --> 39:39.943
I don't even know if people
are gonna like this crab,

39:39.967 --> 39:41.000
but we'll see.

39:41.066 --> 39:42.746
- Good luck.
- All right, buddy. Thank you.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.700
Is this the troll crab?

39:51.767 --> 39:53.266
The rest is
in the storage, okay?

39:53.367 --> 39:54.867
- Okay.
- All right, thank you.

40:00.066 --> 40:02.100
[Jake] <i>Out of the entire</i>
<i>American fleet,</i>

40:02.166 --> 40:06.400
I'm the only one
that's catching red king crab.

40:06.467 --> 40:08.767
[Lauritz] Now it's
big king crab.

40:08.867 --> 40:11.000
[Jake] <i>I'm happy I got</i>
<i>all those big king crab.</i>

40:11.166 --> 40:13.042
<i>I'm looking forward
to getting them to Lenny.</i>

40:13.066 --> 40:14.543
<i>I haven't talked to Sig.</i>

40:14.567 --> 40:17.443
It'd be crazy for him
not to accept this deal.

40:17.467 --> 40:19.066
But, knowing Sig...

40:21.000 --> 40:22.700
I never know
what his answer's gonna be.

40:26.166 --> 40:28.300
[Sig] <i>I learned everything</i>
<i>I know from my father,</i>

40:28.367 --> 40:30.800
<i>and he built something
bigger than himself...</i>

40:31.867 --> 40:33.142
<i>and I would like to do the same,</i>

40:33.166 --> 40:34.567
<i>something bigger than me.</i>

40:36.266 --> 40:38.767
<i>Tonight, it's a big night,</i>

40:38.867 --> 40:41.000
<i>and, uh, I don't know
how this dinner's gonna go,</i>

40:42.567 --> 40:44.100
<i>but we're gonna find out.</i>

40:47.367 --> 40:48.767
<i>I'm looking to build</i>

40:49.500 --> 40:51.266
<i>a sustainable future.</i>

40:52.266 --> 40:53.900
<i>Something for
the next generation.</i>

40:55.166 --> 40:56.200
That's my goal.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.767
Wish us luck.

40:59.867 --> 41:01.266
Hey! [kisses]

41:01.367 --> 41:03.042
I'll see you
later tonight, okay?

41:03.066 --> 41:04.946
-[Mandy] All right.
Good luck, Papa.
-[Sig] Okay.

41:06.367 --> 41:07.767
<i>This troll crab dinner...</i>

41:09.500 --> 41:11.300
<i>...could be the start
of a whole new industry,</i>

41:11.567 --> 41:13.867
<i>and if the people like it,</i>

41:13.967 --> 41:15.767
<i>it's gonna change
everything for us.</i>

41:18.767 --> 41:21.700
<i>Tonight is the night for us
and our future.</i>
