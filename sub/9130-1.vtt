00:58.950 --> 01:00.327
Nice shot, Hamb.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.829
I drilled a little
to the left.

01:02.829 --> 01:05.123
It's 15 feet
from the goddamn hole.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.502
I miscalculated the wind
by a couple knots.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.629
Give me a break.

01:09.629 --> 01:11.840
Well, you know,
it's all a matter
of degrees.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.135
The difference between
the big money and not making
the cut is razor-thin.

01:17.721 --> 01:20.933
Well, I wasn't thinking about
qualifying for the Masters.

01:20.933 --> 01:23.895
Kind of had my sights
set on the NBA.

01:23.895 --> 01:27.899
HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD

01:35.199 --> 01:37.076
Well, your hook shot's
working, Scotty.

01:53.595 --> 01:55.139
Nice shot.

02:00.561 --> 02:03.648
What do you think
I'm doing wrong here?

02:05.567 --> 02:08.612
I think you're standing
too close to the ball.

02:08.612 --> 02:10.114
Yeah.
Pretty bad, huh?

02:10.114 --> 02:11.574
After you hit it.

02:11.574 --> 02:12.658
..Yeah?

02:12.658 --> 02:15.620
They want you at ops
right away, sir.

04:37.572 --> 04:43.329
<font color="#ffffff">- MAN:

04:43.329 --> 04:46.040
Seventh Air Force intelligence
has been indicating

04:46.040 --> 04:48.835
the possibility of
a North Vietnamese/VC offensive.

04:48.835 --> 04:50.879
Now, these photos
confirm it.

04:52.339 --> 04:56.051
NVA troops moving down
the Ho Chi Minh Trail,

04:56.051 --> 05:00.682
south of the DMZ,
near Quang Tri.

05:00.682 --> 05:02.517
Now, they'll combine
with Charlie

05:02.517 --> 05:05.521
and try to hit us hard,

05:05.521 --> 05:07.940
probably in several
places at once.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.027
Glad you could
make it, Colonel.

05:11.027 --> 05:12.904
Sorry, sir.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.326
Strategic Air
Command's putting
everything it's got

05:17.326 --> 05:20.454
in the air two days from now
and will just clobber
the hell out of them.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.873
If we don't stop
their movement,

05:22.873 --> 05:26.002
or at least slow it down
to a trickle,

05:26.002 --> 05:28.505
our ground troops
are going to take
heavy casualties.

05:28.505 --> 05:31.258
Now, our job
remains the same,

05:31.258 --> 05:34.220
fly alongside
the bombers,

05:34.220 --> 05:36.472
throw down
your electronic
smoke screens,

05:36.472 --> 05:38.641
jam the missile radars.

05:38.641 --> 05:41.478
Sir, why don't we put
our surveillance aircraft
up there first, sir?

05:41.478 --> 05:44.857
Have them fly the same route
the big boys are going to fly
on their scheduled run.

05:44.857 --> 05:46.483
Missile reaction
can be recorded,

05:46.483 --> 05:49.570
launch sites
plotted.

05:49.570 --> 05:52.657
Send the fighter jocks
in there to just knock
the hell out of them.

06:09.051 --> 06:12.680
I really appreciate
you volunteering us
for this flight, Hamb.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.516
Didn't think you had
your sights set on
being a full bird.

06:15.516 --> 06:18.019
I've got my sights
set on a condo

06:18.019 --> 06:21.023
on the seventh fairway
at Tucson National.

06:21.023 --> 06:24.026
Six months from now,
that's where the old lady
and me will be.

06:24.026 --> 06:26.529
That sounds
awfully exciting(!)

06:26.529 --> 06:29.657
You think
that's exciting?

06:29.657 --> 06:31.326
You should see
the deck furniture.

06:31.326 --> 06:33.578
Ha!

06:42.213 --> 06:44.799
Mark. Start your music.

06:47.052 --> 06:49.054
I've got
a solid growl.

06:49.054 --> 06:51.432
SAM on scope.
I confirm a launch.

06:51.432 --> 06:53.768
I got him.

06:57.814 --> 07:00.526
Goddamn it.
I didn't think they had
SAMs this far south.

07:00.526 --> 07:02.528
That's why we're here.

07:02.528 --> 07:05.156
Have to go back and
give them the bad news.

07:05.156 --> 07:07.241
I've got another one.

07:07.241 --> 07:09.160
SAM on scope.
2, salvo 3.

07:09.160 --> 07:13.123
They're changing frequencies.
I've got one.

07:13.123 --> 07:16.168
Hold it steady.
Got two.

Don't you, uh...
don't you think

14:35.457 --> 14:37.042
you're pushing it
a little, Captain?

14:37.042 --> 14:40.587

will that take?

15:21.550 --> 15:25.513
A 53-year-old
Lieutenant Colonel?

15:25.513 --> 15:28.642
That's right.
Navigator
on that EB.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.563
They just gave me
crew codes

15:32.563 --> 15:34.607
and no names
and ranks.

15:34.607 --> 15:37.652

15:41.073 --> 15:43.951
I am told
that the Communists

15:43.951 --> 15:46.370

on him that thick.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.956
So, in the morning,
when we get
our birds back,

15:48.956 --> 15:50.333
we're going to go in
and get him.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.085

15:54.046 --> 15:56.090
We'll get him
tomorrow then, sir.

15:56.090 --> 15:57.591
In the meantime,
I want you

15:57.591 --> 15:59.051
to go back
out there tonight.

15:59.051 --> 16:00.720
But he's not going
anywhere, Colonel.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.057
I know, because I'm going
to make damn certain
he's secure.

16:04.057 --> 16:05.517
Then why don't you
send Anderson?

16:05.517 --> 16:08.061
Didn't he just get
his pilot's licence?

16:08.061 --> 16:10.564
You'd better
watch it, Captain.

16:10.564 --> 16:13.568
Look, sir, I'm tired,
I'm two weeks short,

16:13.568 --> 16:16.070
and that area
is pretty hot,

16:16.070 --> 16:18.031
and I don't want
to get shot down

16:18.031 --> 16:21.118
on some public-relations
mission, OK?

16:25.081 --> 16:28.042
All right, then,
I'll make it easy
for you, Captain.

16:28.042 --> 16:30.962
It's an order,
and you damn well
will carry it out.

16:30.962 --> 16:33.090
Is that clear?

16:35.926 --> 16:37.637

20:45.250 --> 20:47.252

the hours.

20:47.252 --> 20:48.754
Yeah. Tell Walker.

20:48.754 --> 20:51.716
I got to start carrying
my sleeping bag with me.

20:51.716 --> 20:53.718
OK... I got two pair.

20:53.718 --> 20:56.346
Three sixes.

20:56.346 --> 20:59.224

two pairs of sevens
and your other six.

21:00.601 --> 21:03.813
Damn! I thought
you newspaper boys

21:03.813 --> 21:06.482
would be a bit sharper than
that. What rag do you
write for again?

21:06.482 --> 21:08.192
New York Times.

21:08.192 --> 21:10.195
Oh, yeah, I picked
one up once.

21:10.195 --> 21:13.240
You read, Ross?
Probably stole it from
some derelict in the park,

21:13.240 --> 21:14.742
who was using it
as a blanket.

21:14.742 --> 21:16.243
I gave him a nickel!

21:16.243 --> 21:19.122
I couldn't
find the comics,
so I returned it.

21:19.122 --> 21:20.748
Did you get
your money back?

21:20.748 --> 21:23.418
Yeah. I ended up finishing
a pint of radiator fluid
with the guy.

21:23.418 --> 21:25.587
It was about then
I figured it was
time to enlist,

21:25.587 --> 21:28.716
and here I am,
the best goddamn
evac pilot in 'Nam!

21:28.716 --> 21:30.217
Tell it, Ross.

21:30.217 --> 21:33.721
Flying those choppers every
day scrambles up your brains.
You get facts confused.

21:33.721 --> 21:35.724
Ross here thinks that
it takes some skill

21:35.724 --> 21:37.726
to keep one of those
eggbeaters up in the air.

21:37.726 --> 21:39.144
Typical FAC pilot.

21:39.144 --> 21:40.813
He labours under
the misapprehension

21:40.813 --> 21:43.232
that he is the most
Sierra-Hotel cowboy
in the Air Force.

21:43.232 --> 21:44.776
The real truth is,
he flies

21:44.776 --> 21:46.736
a fucking VW
Microbus with wings.

21:46.736 --> 21:49.197
Well, this VW pilot

21:49.197 --> 21:51.241
flies ten feet
off the deck,

21:51.241 --> 21:53.953
draws fire from SAMs
down to eight-year-olds

21:53.953 --> 21:55.454
with slingshots
and pebbles.

21:55.454 --> 21:58.666
Ha-ha-ha!
A confirmation
on that.

21:58.666 --> 22:00.001
A lot of times,
I've seen Clark

22:00.001 --> 22:01.628
return here...
You want one?

22:01.628 --> 22:02.838
..with leaves
in his teeth.

22:02.838 --> 22:03.922
Because...

22:03.922 --> 22:05.007
Two.

22:05.007 --> 22:07.384
..us black folks
ain't got no
depth perception.

22:07.384 --> 22:09.512
So we gots to fly
what we gets.

22:09.512 --> 22:11.222
MEN LAUGH

22:11.222 --> 22:13.975
They won't let us fly
fast aeroplanes!

22:13.975 --> 22:17.688
You got to be particular
in this man's
Air Force.

22:17.688 --> 22:22.318
Now, right here, you are
looking at a perfect
flyboy profile.

22:22.318 --> 22:25.989
The kind of guy you can
trust when the shit
hits the fan.

22:25.989 --> 22:28.992
Boom. It's hit
the fan, man!

22:33.581 --> 22:35.124
See you later,
Clarky.

22:35.124 --> 22:37.252
Later, Clarky.

22:37.252 --> 22:40.672
Don't wait up
for me, OK?

22:40.672 --> 22:42.799
Take care.

22:48.598 --> 22:51.768
PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD

22:55.731 --> 22:59.235
Birddog, Bat 21.
Is that you?

22:59.235 --> 23:02.614
Roger, Bat 21.
It's me.

23:02.614 --> 23:06.702
I need a visual reference,
so I can stay in range.

23:06.702 --> 23:08.787
You'll need one.

23:31.521 --> 23:33.023
Got you, Bat 21.

23:33.023 --> 23:35.693
Positive contact.

23:42.033 --> 23:45.746
I appreciate
you dropping by,
Birddog.

23:45.746 --> 23:48.248
That's what
I'm here for.

23:48.248 --> 23:53.880
Charlie walked by my hole
about an hour ago.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.757
How many?

23:55.757 --> 24:00.763
10 or 12. It seems
to be quiet now.

24:00.763 --> 24:03.057
Just stay calm.

24:03.057 --> 24:05.810
You'll be out of there
in the morning.

24:07.270 --> 24:10.774
Birddog, could you do me
a personal favour?

24:10.774 --> 24:12.776
Shoot.

24:12.776 --> 24:14.778
Get in touch
with my wife.

24:14.778 --> 24:16.781
I was supposed to
call her tonight.

24:16.781 --> 24:18.992
She'll be
scared to death.

24:18.992 --> 24:20.744
Her name is Gwen.

24:20.744 --> 24:22.746
I know. I pulled
your personal file.

24:22.746 --> 24:24.748
I got her address
and number,

24:24.748 --> 24:27.251
but I think you should
let it ride for a day.

24:27.251 --> 24:29.086
She may not be
too excited

24:29.086 --> 24:31.255
about where you decided
to spend the night.

24:33.258 --> 24:35.761
Yeah, we'll do it
your way.

24:35.761 --> 24:38.806
I'm glad somebody's
thinking clearly.

24:38.806 --> 24:41.767
How long you been flying
Oscar-Deuces?

24:41.767 --> 24:45.021
Too long.
Due to rotate soon.

24:45.021 --> 24:48.275
You know, I'm probably
the oldest captain
in the Air Force.

24:48.275 --> 24:50.277
How old are you?

24:50.277 --> 24:52.822
Would you believe,
35 in June?

24:52.822 --> 24:56.743
Ha-ha-ha!
That's not very old.

24:56.743 --> 24:59.829
Shit.
Sometimes, it is.

25:01.748 --> 25:03.917
Are you married,
Birddog?

25:03.917 --> 25:06.754
Yeah.

25:06.754 --> 25:09.674
Got a wife and kid
back home.

25:18.768 --> 25:21.270
I've been thinking about
my old lady a lot

25:21.270 --> 25:23.314
since I've been
down here.

25:25.275 --> 25:27.736
Funny how that works.

25:27.736 --> 25:30.739
She keeps bugging me
that my mind

25:30.739 --> 25:34.243
is someplace else
when I'm with her.

25:34.243 --> 25:38.498
Yeah, yeah,
I know what you mean.

25:38.498 --> 25:41.752
Any news on the other
crew members?

25:41.752 --> 25:44.255
No. No other chutes
were spotted.

25:44.255 --> 25:46.299
We're still searching
for the wreckage.

25:46.299 --> 25:47.759
The jungle is hot.

25:47.759 --> 25:50.261
Has anyone contacted
Scott's wife?

25:50.261 --> 25:53.807
Yeah. That's been
taken care of.

25:53.807 --> 25:55.809
THEY SPEAK VIETNAMESE

25:58.271 --> 26:00.773
I feel like
a real jerk.

26:00.773 --> 26:03.777
I'm the big expert
on this deal,

26:03.777 --> 26:05.737
and I get us
shot down.

26:05.737 --> 26:10.117
Don't beat
yourself up, Bat 21.
It happens.

26:11.536 --> 26:15.248
You OK for the night,
Bat 21?

26:17.292 --> 26:20.754
Yeah. No problem.
Thanks for checking in.

26:20.754 --> 26:23.257
Then I'm RTB.

26:23.257 --> 26:25.301
Tuck yourself in.

26:25.301 --> 26:28.430
Carpool will pick you up
at first light.

26:28.430 --> 26:32.726
This is Birddog
signing off, Bat 21.

27:01.801 --> 27:03.845
ENGINES IN DISTANCE

28:47.796 --> 28:50.424
Birddog, Birddog,
this is Bat 21.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.384
Are you
in the vicinity?

28:52.384 --> 28:55.262
Roger, Bat 21.

28:55.262 --> 28:58.349
Just about to give you
a wake-up call.

28:58.349 --> 29:00.769
Birddog, take a look
at the intersection

29:00.769 --> 29:02.771
of hollywood and vine.
Rush-hour traffic.

29:02.771 --> 29:05.274
Could be a problem
for our Jolly Greens.

29:05.274 --> 29:08.277
Roger, Bat 21.
Stand by.

29:08.277 --> 29:10.279
Let's put some hits
on these guys.

29:10.279 --> 29:13.491
I got a good visual.
I'll call them.

29:13.491 --> 29:17.079
You sure? You're pretty
close to the action.
You might get nicked.

29:17.079 --> 29:18.747
I can see the crossroads
from here.

29:18.747 --> 29:21.250
About half a click south
of the rice paddy.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.710
Mark it.

29:22.710 --> 29:26.089
You pulling rank
on me, Bat 21?

29:26.089 --> 29:27.549
I'll take my chances.

29:27.549 --> 29:29.176
You got it.

29:29.176 --> 29:32.263
Here you go.
Enjoy the show!

29:40.981 --> 29:43.233
MEN SHOUTING/MACHINE GUNS FIRING

29:47.989 --> 29:53.370
Birddog to Crabtree,
I marked my targets.
What are you hauling?

29:53.370 --> 29:55.706
Roger, Birddog.
This is Crabtree,

29:55.706 --> 29:57.750
coming in
from the south

29:57.750 --> 29:59.961
with a full load
of snake and nape.

29:59.961 --> 30:02.755
Roger, Crabtree.
You see my smoke?

30:02.755 --> 30:04.758
Uh...affirmative,
Birddog.

30:04.758 --> 30:06.718
Waste the area,
but remember,

30:06.718 --> 30:08.720
we have a friendly
in the vicinity.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.099
Try not to ruin his day
with a stray frag.

30:12.099 --> 30:13.476
Don't worry, Birddog.

30:13.476 --> 30:16.187
We can thread a needle
if we have to.

30:16.187 --> 30:19.775
Thread a needle,
my ass. Shit. Ha-ha!

31:10.332 --> 31:12.334
Birddog,
on your next pass,

31:12.334 --> 31:14.795
move just east
of the intersection.

31:14.795 --> 31:17.256
You got
camouflaged tanks.

31:19.801 --> 31:21.803
Roger, Bat 21.

31:21.803 --> 31:24.806
Crabtree, tanks
just east of intersection,

31:24.806 --> 31:26.809
Missed on first pass.

31:26.809 --> 31:29.812
Roger, Birddog.

31:29.812 --> 31:31.773
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

31:58.803 --> 32:03.976
We're Winchester,
Birddog. Please assess damage.

32:03.976 --> 32:06.395
Additional targets
still appear active.

32:06.395 --> 32:09.732
Copy, Crabtree.
Return to base.
Will advise.

32:13.737 --> 32:15.447
MAN SHOUTS

32:24.916 --> 32:26.460
GUNSHOT

32:43.270 --> 32:47.316
Uh, Bat 21
from Birddog.

32:47.316 --> 32:50.403
Uh, Bat 21?

32:50.403 --> 32:53.949
Bat 21 from Birddog.

32:53.949 --> 32:56.493
Do you copy, Bat 21?

32:58.412 --> 33:00.415
Go, Birddog.

33:00.415 --> 33:01.916
You intact?

33:04.377 --> 33:06.463
Affirmative.

33:06.463 --> 33:07.923
Nice quarterbacking.

33:07.923 --> 33:10.885
Maybe we ought to
leave you in for
the second half.

33:10.885 --> 33:12.929
Negative.
I've seen enough.

33:12.929 --> 33:16.099
I guess it's different
on the ground.

33:18.769 --> 33:20.896
It's too damn close.

33:20.896 --> 33:23.941
Bat 21, your pick-up
may be delayed.

33:23.941 --> 33:26.903
The area
is still too hot.

33:26.903 --> 33:29.948
Negative! Negative! It's
got to be today, goddamn it!

33:29.948 --> 33:33.369
I repeat,
area's still too hot.

33:33.369 --> 33:35.871
It's a war zone, goddamn it!
What do you expect?!

33:35.871 --> 33:39.417
Relax, Bat 21.
We'll get you out
at first light.

33:39.417 --> 33:40.877
Jesus Christ!

33:40.877 --> 33:45.466
Just stay calm.
Birddog will deliver.

33:45.466 --> 33:48.719
Negative, Birddog.
Bat 21 has a plan.

33:48.719 --> 33:50.096
I worked it out
last night.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.432
Birddog would like
to RTB, refuel,

33:52.432 --> 33:54.768
and confirm
before you move.

33:54.768 --> 33:57.521
Negative, Birddog.
Not enough time.

34:05.613 --> 34:08.408
Bat 21! Bat 21!

34:08.408 --> 34:11.954
Birddog would like to
confirm before you move.

34:13.414 --> 34:15.917
Negative.
Bat's on the move.

34:15.917 --> 34:17.918
Heading
for the swanee.

34:17.918 --> 34:19.420
Swanee?

34:19.420 --> 34:21.757
Repeat, heading
for the swanee,

34:21.757 --> 34:23.926
Like in the song.
"Swanee, swanee.

34:23.926 --> 34:25.928
"How I love you.
How I love you."

34:25.928 --> 34:27.596
Yeah, yeah,
I know the song.

34:27.596 --> 34:30.183
"Swanee,
How I Love You."

34:32.143 --> 34:35.772
Uh-huh. I think
I broke the code, Bat 21.

34:35.772 --> 34:37.440
But still
do not advise.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.568
Route takes you through
too many unfriendlies.

34:39.568 --> 34:41.445
Birddog has no way
to track you.

34:41.445 --> 34:44.407
I worked out
a front nine
to avoid the hazards.

34:44.407 --> 34:48.286
Copy this.
Add zero to yardage.

34:48.286 --> 34:51.290
Holes three, six and eight
at Shaw.

34:51.290 --> 34:55.420
South one and 17
at Macdill.

34:55.420 --> 34:59.925
Coming in on two,
12, 14, and 18
at Hickum.

34:59.925 --> 35:01.426
How do you copy?

35:01.426 --> 35:04.138
Copy, but I still don't
know what the hell
you're talking about.

35:07.433 --> 35:11.938
Contact Colonel Douglass
at Kerat Air Base
for instructions.

35:11.938 --> 35:15.943
I'm not sure this is
a good idea, Bat 21.

35:15.943 --> 35:21.282
Bat 21 is teeing off
from the blue markers
now. Out.

35:23.910 --> 35:27.456
Uh, Bat 21,
from Birddog.

35:27.456 --> 35:31.419
Uh, Bat 21, Bat 21,
from Birddog.

35:31.419 --> 35:33.546
Bat... Oh, shit!

35:51.942 --> 35:55.404
You want to
tell me about it?

35:55.404 --> 35:57.448
Hambleton's
moving on me.

35:57.448 --> 35:59.409
Where's
he going?

35:59.409 --> 36:02.704
I don't know.
He gave me some kind
of goddamned code,

36:02.704 --> 36:05.415
after I decided
it was too hot
to pick him up.

36:05.415 --> 36:08.627
<font color="#ffffff">- Yeah, I heard you
brought in the flyboys.
- Mm-mmm...</font>

36:08.627 --> 36:11.339
That was his idea.

36:11.339 --> 36:13.091
That's some kind of
tough bastard.

36:13.091 --> 36:14.426
Shit!

36:14.426 --> 36:16.470
I mean,
he must realise

36:16.470 --> 36:18.430
they aren't always
that accurate.

36:18.430 --> 36:21.934
I've seen frags drop 30 feet
in front of my windscreen.

36:21.934 --> 36:23.436
Mm-hmm.

36:23.436 --> 36:25.855
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

36:25.855 --> 36:28.733
Sit down and finish
your beer. Sit down.

36:28.733 --> 36:31.862
I got to go up again.
I got to find him.

36:31.862 --> 36:34.615
You're spending
more time in the air
than on Mother Earth.

36:34.615 --> 36:36.200
You look like hell.

36:39.412 --> 36:41.456
Well, I need
the overtime.

36:41.456 --> 36:44.418
You are going for
a DFFC, aren't you?

36:44.418 --> 36:47.463
A Distinguished
Fucking Flying Cross.

36:47.463 --> 36:50.466
Man, I must have
vapour-locked,
or something.

36:50.466 --> 36:53.970
"FAC pilot
saves Colonel!"

36:53.970 --> 36:56.473
You're gearing up
for the ceremony.
A full dress parade,

36:56.473 --> 36:58.976
a nice shiny medal
to show the folks
back home,

36:58.976 --> 37:01.938
and a newfound respect
in the military community.

37:01.938 --> 37:04.649
Shit! Clarky,
stick around. Come on.

37:04.649 --> 37:06.276
We'll take
a chopper up.

37:06.276 --> 37:08.779
We'll shoot a few cows
and have a barbecue.
What do you say?

37:08.779 --> 37:11.949
Ross, not tonight, yeah?

37:11.949 --> 37:13.993
Don't you think
you've got

37:13.993 --> 37:16.746
a little obsessive
behaviour going here?

37:16.746 --> 37:20.125
Obsessive behaviour?
Me, obsessive behaviour?

37:20.125 --> 37:22.461
Man, I recall some of
the crazy, lunatic shit

37:22.461 --> 37:23.963
that you've done
in your machine.

37:23.963 --> 37:27.300
Maybe I like hauling
those sorry dudes
out of the bush.

37:27.300 --> 37:30.679
Maybe I like to see their big,
sloppy smiles when I drag them
into the chopper,

37:30.679 --> 37:34.766
because you just know they thought
they were going to spend the rest
of the war dodging punji sticks,

37:34.766 --> 37:37.937
snakes, and gooks, and I hand them
a camel and a candy bar,

37:37.937 --> 37:41.441
and they smile like
when they got laid
for the first time.

37:41.441 --> 37:43.944
I'm not into this
death-and-destruction
bullshit either,

37:43.944 --> 37:45.612
or flying
fucking medals.

37:45.612 --> 37:50.367
You know, all I want to do
is bring the old man back.

37:51.953 --> 37:55.457
OK... Go on. Get him
through the night.

37:55.457 --> 37:59.002
I'll haul his ass out
in the morning.

37:59.002 --> 38:01.005
OK, Birddog?

39:09.999 --> 39:11.251
CLUCKING

40:10.025 --> 40:11.986
MAN SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE

40:14.822 --> 40:17.117
HE REPLIES IN VIETNAMESE

40:17.117 --> 40:19.745

40:25.501 --> 40:29.464
No, no, no, no.
Look... Friend.

40:29.464 --> 40:32.009
HE REPEATS THE SAME WORD
IN VIETNAMESE

40:34.011 --> 40:37.682
< Friend. Friend.
MAN SHOUTS ANGRILY

41:04.545 --> 41:05.672
GUNSHOT

41:38.500 --> 41:40.836
Pa?

41:43.464 --> 41:46.009
I'm sorry.

42:08.993 --> 42:11.997
WOMAN SOBS SOFTLY

43:28.458 --> 43:30.544
HE GROANS

43:50.024 --> 43:51.776
HE SOBS

43:57.366 --> 43:59.994
No, no, no.
Number 14 at Hickum.

43:59.994 --> 44:02.997
Right, Hickum.

44:02.997 --> 44:05.917
Yeah, the par four
across the water.

44:05.917 --> 44:08.462
That's the one.
Hold the phone
a minute.

44:08.462 --> 44:10.339
Uh, Captain,

44:10.339 --> 44:13.467
Uh...number 14
at Hickum,
390 yards.

44:13.467 --> 44:15.011
Draw it in.

44:15.011 --> 44:17.013
Don't forget
to add the zero.

44:17.013 --> 44:18.473
Come here, Clark.

44:18.473 --> 44:20.517
Colonel, that puts
our puzzle together.

44:20.517 --> 44:24.522
Now let's hope
the damn thing
works. ..Right.

44:24.522 --> 44:27.525
Yeah, I will
keep you abreast
of everything.

44:27.525 --> 44:29.027
Right, I will.

44:29.027 --> 44:32.072
And thank you.
Mm-hmm.

44:33.490 --> 44:35.993
What have
we got, sir?

44:35.993 --> 44:39.997
I got a lot
to tell you
about your boy.

44:39.997 --> 44:42.000
Seems like
Hambleton was flying

44:42.000 --> 44:45.504
a pave-penny mission
for a major bombing
strike, Captain.

44:45.504 --> 44:47.506
He came up with
the idea himself,

44:47.506 --> 44:49.508
and then he
volunteers to go.

44:49.508 --> 44:51.510
Right man
for the job
and all that.

44:51.510 --> 44:54.514
Sounds like to me he must have
written the damn manuals.

44:54.514 --> 44:56.516
Wouldn't Charlie
like to get

44:56.516 --> 44:59.019
their hands on him,
open him up? Shit.

44:59.019 --> 45:01.522
It doesn't get
any better.

45:01.522 --> 45:04.525
The strike was scheduled
for 07:00 hours tomorrow.

45:04.525 --> 45:06.527
Their objective,
carpet-bomb

45:06.527 --> 45:08.488
this crossroads
where Hambleton is

45:08.488 --> 45:12.117
and everything around it
for 8 kilometres.

45:12.117 --> 45:15.037
HE SIGHS

45:16.497 --> 45:19.500
That's what he was
talking about.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.711
Exactly.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.467
He won't make it.

45:26.467 --> 45:30.346
They're going
to blast the whole
goddamn area, huh?

45:30.346 --> 45:32.348
I'm fucking
blowing my brains out

45:32.348 --> 45:34.017
trying to get
this motherfucker home,

45:34.017 --> 45:36.019
and they're talking
about carpet-bombing!

45:36.019 --> 45:37.521
Goddamn it,
Captain...

45:37.521 --> 45:39.022
Now, wait
a minute...

45:39.022 --> 45:40.733
Shut up,
goddamn it!

45:42.985 --> 45:45.947
I bought us 24 hours.

45:45.947 --> 45:48.491
That's the best
I could do.

45:48.491 --> 45:51.995
Had to put
my ass on the line
to get that.

45:51.995 --> 45:55.041
I told Seventh Air
we'd get him out of there.

45:55.041 --> 45:57.794
That's exactly what
we're going to do.

46:04.009 --> 46:06.178
Nice work, Colonel.

46:06.178 --> 46:08.180
Let's don't
start jumping
up and down,

46:08.180 --> 46:11.017
throwing babies
in the air yet,
Captain.

46:11.017 --> 46:13.019
We'd better
wait and see

46:13.019 --> 46:15.063
if Hambleton's
code works.

46:15.063 --> 46:17.733
Hmm. You got
any ideas?

46:17.733 --> 46:19.235
Douglass knew
what Hambleton

46:19.235 --> 46:22.071
was talking about
right away.

46:22.071 --> 46:24.032
I mean, they're both
golf fanatics.

46:24.032 --> 46:27.077
They play three times a week.
Hambleton's got a four handicap.

46:27.077 --> 46:29.621
With all that in mind, come here.
I want to show you something.

46:29.621 --> 46:31.040
..Thank you, Howard.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.503
Now...stay
with me, Captain.

46:35.503 --> 46:37.547
This gets
pretty wild.

46:37.547 --> 46:42.135
Hambleton wants to get
here to the river,
to the swanee, right?

46:42.135 --> 46:43.470
Well, how's he
going to do that?

46:43.470 --> 46:46.641
I mean, he's not about
to just tear ass
out through there

46:46.641 --> 46:48.017
and lose contact
with you.

46:48.017 --> 46:49.102
Hell, he's dead meat.

46:49.102 --> 46:51.563
On the other hand,
he can't get on the radio

46:51.563 --> 46:53.774
and tell you where he's
going. Charlie's got VHF too.

46:53.774 --> 46:56.986
So he gives you
an imaginary
nine holes of golf.

46:56.986 --> 46:59.488
When you lay those nine holes
over our map, Captain...

46:59.488 --> 47:03.118
there's what
they look like.

47:03.118 --> 47:05.579
Now we
can track him,

47:05.579 --> 47:07.539
now that we know
where he is.

47:07.539 --> 47:09.500
We know exactly where
he comes out at the end

47:09.500 --> 47:11.836
because he didn't pick
those holes at random.

47:11.836 --> 47:13.963
They come off three
Air Force golf courses

47:13.963 --> 47:15.715
he's played
a hundred times,

47:15.715 --> 47:17.467
knows them like
the back of his hand.

47:17.467 --> 47:19.052
Now, let's take
these three

47:19.052 --> 47:21.013
that come off
Shaw Air Force base.

47:21.013 --> 47:24.058
First hole, 410-yard
par-four dogleg.

47:24.058 --> 47:26.561
We add that zero
Hambleton's talking about,

47:26.561 --> 47:28.021
it reads 4,100 yards,

47:28.021 --> 47:30.524
and the first green
puts him right there.

47:30.524 --> 47:32.526
Next green,
here and here.

47:32.526 --> 47:36.197
These two holes
come off the front
and back of Macdill.

47:36.197 --> 47:38.032
These four finishing
holes here,

47:38.032 --> 47:39.659
according
to Douglass,

47:39.659 --> 47:41.202
are the holes
Hambleton birdied

47:41.202 --> 47:43.038
the last time
he played Hickum

47:43.038 --> 47:45.040
to shoot
a one-under-par 71.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.042
Pretty good score, huh?
Ha-ha-ha!

47:47.042 --> 47:49.795
Clever son of a bitch.

47:49.795 --> 47:51.297
You play golf,
Captain?

47:51.297 --> 47:54.050
No, sir.
Golf wasn't big
in my neighbourhood.

47:54.050 --> 47:57.054
All right.
Well, all these holes
are on these cards,

47:57.054 --> 48:00.057
and this is a glossary
of golf terminology.

48:00.057 --> 48:03.019
Now, you're going
to communicate
with Hambleton

48:03.019 --> 48:05.146
using these terms,
because Charlie won't know

48:05.146 --> 48:07.023
what in the hell
you're talking about

48:07.023 --> 48:08.567
until it's
too late, anyway.

48:08.567 --> 48:11.028
So get busy.
Learn this.

48:11.028 --> 48:14.073
That's the key
to Hambleton's code.

48:17.535 --> 48:19.537
Dogleg.

48:19.537 --> 48:22.082
Dogleg.

48:23.542 --> 48:24.626
Hmm.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.999
Does Anderson know
you borrowed his prop?

49:35.999 --> 49:37.083
No, sir.

49:37.083 --> 49:39.044
I'd love to be there
when he tries to take off.

49:39.044 --> 49:41.964
He's going to need
a hell of a long
runway, Captain.

49:41.964 --> 49:43.132
Yeah.

49:43.132 --> 49:45.885
Look, at
the risk of being
out of line, sir,

49:45.885 --> 49:47.554
I think you look
a bit overextended.

49:47.554 --> 49:50.932
Now, in the best interest
of the mission and
your personal safety,

49:50.932 --> 49:52.392
I put together
this tape.

49:52.392 --> 49:54.103
Some serious
sounds, Captain.

49:54.103 --> 49:56.772
They're guaranteed
to keep you alert.

49:56.772 --> 50:00.109
You're quite a man,
Rumbaugh.

50:00.109 --> 50:03.822
You just have
a good flight,
all right, sir?

50:03.822 --> 50:05.365
All right.

50:08.744 --> 50:10.788
ENGINE REVS

51:07.894 --> 51:09.813

51:31.254 --> 51:34.299
God. Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

51:35.759 --> 51:37.344
Fuck.

MUSIC CONTINUES

52:11.091 --> 52:13.260
Birddog on radio.
Bat 21, this is Birddog.

52:13.260 --> 52:16.305
Come in, come in.
Where the hell are you?

52:18.766 --> 52:20.518
Birddog,
this is Bat 21.

52:20.518 --> 52:22.270
I read you
loud and clear.

52:22.270 --> 52:23.772
MUSIC STOPS

52:23.772 --> 52:27.192
Copy, Bat 21. It's good
to hear from you.
I thought I'd lost you.

52:27.192 --> 52:31.739
It's good to hear
your voice, Birddog.

52:31.739 --> 52:33.700
I'm at
the third fairway,

52:33.700 --> 52:35.785
trying to get a fix
on your position.

52:35.785 --> 52:37.287
You broke the code.

52:37.287 --> 52:40.291
I'm working on it.
It's not an easy
game to play.

52:40.291 --> 52:42.084
Uh, what is your...

52:44.879 --> 52:45.964
..lie?

52:45.964 --> 52:50.761
Birddog, I'm
150 yards northwest
of the third green.

52:50.761 --> 52:54.807
I'll give you
a signal, white one.

53:03.650 --> 53:05.361
Got you marked.

53:12.035 --> 53:13.286
Any problems?

53:13.286 --> 53:16.248
I ran into
an unfriendly
a while back.

53:16.248 --> 53:18.751
I had to do
some backtracking.

53:18.751 --> 53:20.753
You all right?

53:20.753 --> 53:22.922
My landing gear's
a little damaged,

53:22.922 --> 53:24.716
but it's
still serviceable.

53:24.716 --> 53:28.095
I'm sorry to hear
about that.

53:31.265 --> 53:33.267
Listen, Birddog...

53:33.267 --> 53:36.270
you got to get me
out of here.

53:36.270 --> 53:38.148
Affirmative.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.317
I'm here to tell you
the good news.

53:40.317 --> 53:43.237
We bought 24 hours.
Copy that?

53:43.237 --> 53:45.990
You bet I copy.

53:45.990 --> 53:47.950
You must have friends
in high places

53:47.950 --> 53:49.786
who want to see
your face again.

53:49.786 --> 53:52.247
That's nice to know.

53:52.247 --> 53:55.083
Uh, Bat 21...

53:55.083 --> 53:56.961
stay put
and don't transmit.

53:56.961 --> 53:59.171
I have business
to take care of.

54:03.760 --> 54:05.804
Uh, this is Birddog.
This is Birddog.

54:05.804 --> 54:09.224

This is Birddog.

54:33.752 --> 54:35.838
Birddog...

54:37.798 --> 54:40.885
..I killed
a man today.

54:42.804 --> 54:45.432
Uh... Roger that.

54:47.810 --> 54:50.021
He wasn't even
a soldier.

54:51.647 --> 54:53.983
He just kept coming.

54:53.983 --> 54:56.027
I couldn't stop him.

54:58.530 --> 55:01.826
Uh...I understand.

55:03.286 --> 55:07.540
I didn't want
to do it.

55:07.540 --> 55:10.335
I never had to do
anything like that
before in my life.

55:11.795 --> 55:13.797
I've always
been sitting
in an airplane

55:13.797 --> 55:17.677
at 30,000 feet
with a cup of coffee
in front of me.

55:19.888 --> 55:22.182
Look here, Bat 21,
I never met you,

55:22.182 --> 55:23.809
but you don't sound
like a killer.

55:23.809 --> 55:26.312
I'm sure you couldn't
stop it from happening.

55:26.312 --> 55:29.690
Now, the important thing
is to put it behind you.

55:32.652 --> 55:33.987
EXPLOSION

55:35.781 --> 55:37.783
What the hell's
going on, Birddog?

55:37.783 --> 55:41.287
There's too many
unfriendly foursomes
in your vicinity.

Bat 21?

55:56.304 --> 55:58.807
Yeah, Birddog,
I'm here.

55:58.807 --> 56:00.517
All right.

56:00.517 --> 56:02.811
I want you
to listen real hard.

56:02.811 --> 56:05.314
I know you're hurting,
but we have to deal with

56:05.314 --> 56:07.316
getting you back
to the clubhouse.

56:07.316 --> 56:10.403

56:21.290 --> 56:24.294
That's a long

56:24.294 --> 56:26.296
Yeah. There's
a few hazards,

56:26.296 --> 56:28.340
but the green

I should be able
to play through.

56:38.310 --> 56:41.021
Looking forward to
buying you a drink.

56:41.021 --> 56:44.358

Birddog. Come in.

58:56.841 --> 58:59.344
Birddog, Bat 21.
Go ahead.

58:59.344 --> 59:01.847
Are you still
on course?

59:04.308 --> 59:07.312
Birddog, yeah,
I'm an easy chip shot

59:07.312 --> 59:08.813

59:08.813 --> 59:12.401
except that there's
a village right here
in front of me.

59:12.401 --> 59:14.820
Reconned yesterday.
Area's safe.

59:14.820 --> 59:16.864
We'll take
another look.

59:16.864 --> 59:19.867
OK, Birddog.

59:31.547 --> 59:33.341
Shine up
your medal, Clarky,

59:33.341 --> 59:35.010
I'm bringing back
your boy.

59:35.010 --> 59:38.931
I'll personally
alert Bat 21.

59:38.931 --> 59:43.477
Bat 21, this is Birddog
again. Come in.

59:43.477 --> 59:45.730
Yeah, Birddog,
I'm still here.

59:45.730 --> 59:48.233
Not for long.
I'm sending in
my best man.

59:48.233 --> 59:50.277
Get your flares ready,
and don't pop the smoke

59:50.277 --> 59:54.240
until you hear
from Jolly Greens.
Understand?

59:54.240 --> 59:56.284
Roger, Birddog.

01:00:06.754 --> 01:00:11.259
<font color="#ffffff">- WALKER:
- Bat 21,
Cobra Leader.
Do you copy?</font>

01:00:12.761 --> 01:00:14.471
Go ahead.

01:00:14.471 --> 01:00:17.224
We'll come over
your position
from the north.

01:00:17.224 --> 01:00:19.810
Be ready to pop
those flares.

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:22.355
I've been ready
for two days.

01:00:42.628 --> 01:00:44.838
Hold what you got,
Big Sky.

01:00:44.838 --> 01:00:47.758
I'm going to send Birddog in
to take a look.

01:00:47.758 --> 01:00:49.928
Roger.

01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:06.488
Talk to me,
Birddog.

01:01:06.488 --> 01:01:08.949
Looks quiet.

01:01:08.949 --> 01:01:12.787
I'm going in
for a closer look.

01:01:12.787 --> 01:01:16.249
Here we go.
Be right back.

01:01:36.105 --> 01:01:39.275
It don't look
like anybody's home.

01:01:52.874 --> 01:01:56.336
All right, Big Sky,
go get him.

01:01:56.336 --> 01:01:58.714
I'll cover your tail.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.353
Jolly Green
from Birddog.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:13.898
You're looking good,
looking good.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:16.776
Coming in on your LZ.

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:26.620
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

01:02:34.504 --> 01:02:36.256
Shit! We're taking hits.

01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:41.053
The village is hot!
The village is hot!

01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:44.349
Birddog, there's
at least two machine guns
in the village!

01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:48.145
I thought you said
that goddamn LZ
was secure!

01:02:48.145 --> 01:02:51.273
Get back in the trees, Bat 21.
Back in the trees!

01:03:01.451 --> 01:03:03.746
Stevie, open up.

01:03:23.059 --> 01:03:24.811
Get those mines ready.

01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:27.230
We're going to drop them
right here in this paddy.

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:29.024
Keep them away
from Bat 21.

01:03:45.918 --> 01:03:48.171
Drop those mines!

01:03:57.223 --> 01:03:59.183
Son of a bitch!

01:04:03.313 --> 01:04:06.358
Big Sky,
get the hell out of there.

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:08.944
I'm coming back.
Open up, Steven.

01:04:10.821 --> 01:04:13.867
Get on those guns
and give them hell.

01:04:25.088 --> 01:04:26.172
Agh!

01:04:26.172 --> 01:04:28.341
Son of a bitch!
He's hit!

01:04:28.341 --> 01:04:31.053
Take care of him.
Hendricks,
get on the gun!

01:04:31.053 --> 01:04:32.846
We're going to
fix you up.

01:04:32.846 --> 01:04:35.307
Big Sky,
abort mission.

01:04:35.307 --> 01:04:38.394
Repeat, abort! Abort!

01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:42.858
Boys, they're not
going to stick a fork
in me till I'm done.

01:04:42.858 --> 01:04:44.318
We're going to get
that boy.

01:04:44.318 --> 01:04:46.987
Abort mission, Big Sky!
Get the hell out of there, Ross!

01:04:46.987 --> 01:04:49.323
Sorry. Transmission
is breaking up.

01:04:49.323 --> 01:04:51.492
Repeat, abort!

01:04:51.492 --> 01:04:54.162
Sorry. Transmission
is breaking up.

01:04:54.162 --> 01:04:56.873
That's bullshit!
You heard me!

01:04:56.873 --> 01:04:59.001
I said abort!

01:05:05.925 --> 01:05:09.429
Fuck it.
Let's go in.

01:05:13.517 --> 01:05:16.062
Come on, you...

01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:26.323
Ross,
get out of there!

01:05:31.037 --> 01:05:32.747
Son of a bitch!

01:05:32.747 --> 01:05:37.044
He's hit!
Birddog, he's hit!

01:05:37.044 --> 01:05:38.879
Shit!

01:05:41.257 --> 01:05:44.386
Shit! I'm losing it!

01:05:56.316 --> 01:05:59.319
Up, Big Sky!
Big Rocks! Pull out!

01:05:59.319 --> 01:06:00.863
Shit.
We're going down.

01:06:00.863 --> 01:06:03.616
We're going down.
Mayday! Mayday!

01:06:10.582 --> 01:06:13.961
I can't see
a goddamn thing,
goddamn it!

01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:16.422
We're going down.
Mayday.

01:06:42.159 --> 01:06:43.869
HE COUGHS

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:45.413
Start, motherfucker!

01:06:45.413 --> 01:06:47.373
MEN SHOUT

01:06:47.373 --> 01:06:48.458
Start!

01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:50.293
Let's get
out of here, Ross!

01:06:50.293 --> 01:06:53.213
Fuck!
They're coming!

01:06:53.213 --> 01:06:55.925
The gun jammed!
Let's go, Ross! Come on!

01:06:55.925 --> 01:06:59.596
Goddamn it!
Let's fucking go!

01:06:59.596 --> 01:07:02.390
Start! Shit.

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:04.893
Start!

01:07:04.893 --> 01:07:06.604
Shit.

01:07:06.604 --> 01:07:09.732
Come on, Pearson.
We got to get
out of here.

01:07:09.732 --> 01:07:11.275
Come on, Ross!
Jesus! The gun!

01:07:11.275 --> 01:07:13.862
Come on! We got to get
out of here!

01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:15.655
Goddamn it, come on!

01:07:15.655 --> 01:07:17.533
GUNFIRE

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.410
Agh!

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.746
Get up, man!
We got to go!

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:23.915
Aah!

01:07:29.338 --> 01:07:33.801
Finley, goddamn it!
Give me the gun!

01:07:33.801 --> 01:07:36.387
Shit! Come on,
give me the gun, Finley!

01:07:36.387 --> 01:07:39.432
Give me the goddamn gun,
goddamn it!

01:07:39.432 --> 01:07:42.769
Jesus Christ!
Don't shoot!

01:07:42.769 --> 01:07:45.606
Don't shoot!

01:07:45.606 --> 01:07:47.984
Don't shoot!
Holy shit!

01:07:47.984 --> 01:07:51.362
I'm fuckin' hit, man!

01:07:51.362 --> 01:07:53.406
Jesus Christ!

01:07:53.406 --> 01:07:55.409
Oh, God!

01:07:55.409 --> 01:08:00.498
Steve, stay alive!
Someone will be back.

01:08:00.498 --> 01:08:02.792
Don't fuckin'
leave us, Ross!

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:06.463
Just stay alive,
goddamn it!

01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:09.133
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:15.348
Don't leave
us, Ross!

01:08:15.348 --> 01:08:17.809
Don't worry.
I'll be back.

01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:20.645
All right!

01:08:20.645 --> 01:08:22.856
SHOUTING CONTINUES

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:27.819
Ross! Ross!

01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:30.365
GUNFIRE

01:08:30.365 --> 01:08:32.826
Goddamn you!

01:09:24.843 --> 01:09:27.263
Birddog, they've got
two of our men.

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:30.308
I think the rest
of the crew is dead.

01:09:30.308 --> 01:09:32.310
Uh, copy, Bat 21.
Stand by.

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:34.437
Cobra Leader, Charlie
has two of our airmen.

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:36.314
Can you identify?

01:09:36.314 --> 01:09:39.818
Negative, Birddog.
Can't make out from here.

01:09:39.818 --> 01:09:42.321
We're holding
our fire.

01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:46.158
They shot
my damn hydraulics out.

01:09:46.158 --> 01:09:49.871
I'm not going to be able
to put this thing down here.

01:09:49.871 --> 01:09:51.832
I'm going down
for a closer look.

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:53.334
Not advisable, Birddog.

01:09:53.334 --> 01:09:55.503
It will be
a quick pass.

01:10:01.093 --> 01:10:04.138
GUNFIRE

01:10:07.016 --> 01:10:08.684
Confirmed, two airmen.

01:10:08.684 --> 01:10:10.937
One is pilot.

01:10:21.407 --> 01:10:23.451
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

01:10:25.787 --> 01:10:28.415
You know what, Charlie?
I don't follow
your fucking drift.

01:10:28.415 --> 01:10:30.918
I took Spanish
in school.
No comprendo.

01:10:30.918 --> 01:10:33.170
HE SHOUTS IN VIETNAMESE

01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:37.425
Get your fucking slimy
fucking hands off me!

01:10:39.886 --> 01:10:43.766
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

01:10:43.766 --> 01:10:46.394
I don't
understand you.

01:10:46.394 --> 01:10:50.774
Birddog, they're
trying to get him
to tell where I am.

01:10:50.774 --> 01:10:53.443
Copy, Bat 21.
Just stay low.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.584
GUNSHOT

01:11:07.584 --> 01:11:09.962
Bastard! Motherfucker!

01:11:23.894 --> 01:11:26.481
They just killed
one of our men.

01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:29.276
Was it the pilot,
Bat 21?

01:11:29.276 --> 01:11:31.945
I don't think so.
It's me they want.

01:11:31.945 --> 01:11:34.198
I'm going to give
myself up.

01:11:34.198 --> 01:11:37.076
Keep your ass down, Bat 21!
Charlie doesn't bargain.

01:11:37.076 --> 01:11:38.911
Nothing you can
do about it.

01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:41.998
Now, retreat double-time
back into the trees.

01:12:06.818 --> 01:12:08.153
Come on, fella.
Come closer.

01:12:08.153 --> 01:12:10.447
Come on. Come on,
you motherfucker.

01:12:10.447 --> 01:12:12.449
Come on.

01:12:12.449 --> 01:12:14.452
Oh!

01:12:14.452 --> 01:12:15.995
HE IMITATES AN EXPLOSION

01:12:17.455 --> 01:12:18.998
Come on.

01:12:18.998 --> 01:12:21.918
They're walking him
out into the minefield.

01:12:21.918 --> 01:12:23.962
Ah, Jesus!

01:12:27.425 --> 01:12:29.469
Come on!

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:11.933
Hey, come on!

01:13:11.933 --> 01:13:13.018
Agh!

01:13:14.436 --> 01:13:16.897
ROSS SCREAMS

01:13:16.897 --> 01:13:20.568
Aah! Aah!

01:13:22.654 --> 01:13:23.905
Goddamn it!

01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:36.753
Aah!

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:52.938
Motherfucker!

01:13:55.024 --> 01:13:58.194
You lowlife...

01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:18.926
I've got
enough dead heroes
for one day, Clark!

01:14:18.926 --> 01:14:21.429
Get your ass
out of there!

01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:23.723
Oh, fuck.

01:14:29.646 --> 01:14:32.441
You'll get Bat 21
back on the course!

01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:37.113
Then rendezvous with me
at Hilo-1-8-5.

01:14:37.113 --> 01:14:40.200
I'm going to waste
this whole goddamned area!

01:14:50.628 --> 01:14:55.634
Four-square leader,
hustle your ass over here.

01:14:55.634 --> 01:14:59.472
One click north
of Hilo-1-niner-6.

01:14:59.472 --> 01:15:01.974
Gun emplacement
in village.

01:15:01.974 --> 01:15:06.438
Jolly Green down.
Crew is dead.

01:15:06.438 --> 01:15:09.566
Look for the smoke.

01:15:13.905 --> 01:15:15.949
People are still
in the village.

01:15:15.949 --> 01:15:17.951
Charlie is using them
for cover.

01:15:17.951 --> 01:15:20.454
Stay off
frequency, Bat 21.

01:15:20.454 --> 01:15:22.915
Await instructions
from Birddog.

01:15:29.464 --> 01:15:33.468
Birddog. Birddog,
people are in the village.

01:15:33.468 --> 01:15:37.306
Repeat, civilians,
women and children,
in the village.

01:15:37.306 --> 01:15:40.017
That's a confirmation.
Will advise.

01:15:41.978 --> 01:15:44.731
Cobra Leader,
this is Birddog.

01:15:44.731 --> 01:15:46.316
Village is still
not clear.

01:15:46.316 --> 01:15:47.901
Civilians
still in area.

01:15:47.901 --> 01:15:50.654
Stay off frequency.

01:15:50.654 --> 01:15:52.949
Delay the strike.
Repeat, delay strike.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:56.369
Bat 21,
get back on course.

01:15:56.369 --> 01:15:58.163
Will connect
with you at swanee.

01:15:58.163 --> 01:16:01.208
Fuck the goddamn swanee.
Delay the strike!

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:02.960
That was my friend
laying in the mud

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.795
with his fucking head
blown off!

01:16:04.795 --> 01:16:06.255
Now, get back
on course!

01:16:06.255 --> 01:16:09.009
Now, do as I say!
Back on course!

01:17:11.454 --> 01:17:14.499
People keep dying
all around me.

01:17:19.463 --> 01:17:22.008
I'm through killing.

01:17:23.468 --> 01:17:26.012
I'm through,
goddamn it.

01:18:13.483 --> 01:18:15.026
HE SIGHS

01:18:17.988 --> 01:18:20.157
You called
for me, sir?

01:18:23.953 --> 01:18:25.496
Ahem...

01:18:25.496 --> 01:18:27.999
Lost six people
today, Clark.

01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:30.627
Kids, all of them,
just kids.

01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:34.882
And I couldn't
guarantee

01:18:34.882 --> 01:18:36.425
we'd get him
out of there

01:18:36.425 --> 01:18:38.261
if we had another week.
Damn it, it's too hot.

01:18:38.261 --> 01:18:41.431
HE SIGHS

01:18:41.431 --> 01:18:44.935
So, the strike
is a go...

01:18:44.935 --> 01:18:47.438
07:00 hours
tomorrow.

01:18:47.438 --> 01:18:50.441
They're
going to level
the whole area.

01:18:50.441 --> 01:18:52.944
All we can do is
hope and pray to God

01:18:52.944 --> 01:18:55.947
Hambleton makes it
to the river.

01:18:55.947 --> 01:18:57.908
I, uh...

01:18:57.908 --> 01:19:00.911
Did I ever
call the Navy,

01:19:00.911 --> 01:19:03.456
and, uh, they're
going to send

01:19:03.456 --> 01:19:05.542
a patrol boat
up there.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.504
Where are you
headed?

01:19:10.964 --> 01:19:13.759
I'm going to help him
make it to the river, sir.

01:19:15.303 --> 01:19:17.430
Planes are
grounded, Clark.

01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:20.267
We are not to go
back in there

01:19:20.267 --> 01:19:22.144
until the strike
is over.

01:19:23.604 --> 01:19:26.440
Our hands
are tied.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.484
Yes, sir.

01:19:41.457 --> 01:19:43.001
HE SIGHS

01:20:29.428 --> 01:20:32.473
Birddog, Bat 21. Over.

01:20:34.434 --> 01:20:37.938
Birddog, Bat 21.
How do you read? Over.

01:20:37.938 --> 01:20:41.442
'Birddog, this is Bat 21.
Come in.

01:20:41.442 --> 01:20:44.445
'I'm on the sixth hole, Birddog.
Do you copy?

01:20:44.445 --> 01:20:46.990
'Birddog,
this is Bat 21.

01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:50.535
'Come in, Birddog.'

01:21:56.443 --> 01:21:57.945
Thank you.

01:22:14.464 --> 01:22:16.174
For me?

01:22:18.927 --> 01:22:21.013
BOY SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE

01:24:40.504 --> 01:24:43.966
Definitely not
a good idea, sir.
It's a bad idea.

01:24:43.966 --> 01:24:45.968
I trained in one
of these things
15 years ago.

01:24:45.968 --> 01:24:48.012
So, just refresh
my memory.

01:24:48.012 --> 01:24:49.556
You got
three minutes.

01:24:53.018 --> 01:24:54.978
Let's go,
Rumbaugh.

01:24:54.978 --> 01:24:56.397
All right.

01:24:56.397 --> 01:24:57.565
OK.

01:24:57.565 --> 01:24:59.984
This is your rotor speed.
Keep it in the green.

01:24:59.984 --> 01:25:01.486
This is
your engine speed.

01:25:01.486 --> 01:25:03.029
Keep it also
in the green.

01:25:03.029 --> 01:25:04.948
Red-line and you
crash and burn.

01:25:04.948 --> 01:25:07.451
All right, pedals.
Pedals work the same
as your ship.

01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:09.495
The stick does not.
It's cyclic.

01:25:09.495 --> 01:25:11.664
It controls the angles
of your blades, all right?

01:25:11.664 --> 01:25:14.500
I can't believe
you're taking
the old man's ship.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.295
All right, power.
Power's controlled
by your collective.

01:25:17.295 --> 01:25:18.839
One thing you may
have forgotten is,

01:25:18.839 --> 01:25:21.467
when you increase power,
you increase left pedal

01:25:21.467 --> 01:25:24.971
to compensate for
increased torque.
Got it?

01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:28.975
Yeah, um...yeah,
it's coming back to me.

01:25:28.975 --> 01:25:31.687
And what about
autorotation?

01:25:31.687 --> 01:25:33.605
Why? You planning
on not coming back, sir?

01:25:33.605 --> 01:25:36.484
Tell me anyway.

01:25:36.484 --> 01:25:40.154
All right.
Your engine quits.

01:25:40.154 --> 01:25:41.448
You're falling out
of the sky.

01:25:41.448 --> 01:25:45.577
Now, all you've got left
is the energy stored
in your blades, OK?

01:25:45.577 --> 01:25:47.246
Push the left...

01:25:47.246 --> 01:25:50.583
No, push the right,
the right pedal
to the floor,

01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:52.377
collective down,

01:25:52.377 --> 01:25:54.587
keep your rotor speed
in the green.

01:25:54.587 --> 01:25:58.634
Keep it at about 80 knots
and about 100 feet
off the deck.

01:25:58.634 --> 01:26:01.554
Begin to flare and then
cushion it on down
with the collective.

01:26:01.554 --> 01:26:04.056
Now, you may
start to spin,

01:26:04.056 --> 01:26:06.392
but that's cool.
Don't panic.

01:26:06.392 --> 01:26:08.603
Key point being,
he who hesitates...

01:26:08.603 --> 01:26:10.606
You don't want to
hesitate, all right?

01:26:10.606 --> 01:26:12.107
All right.

01:26:12.107 --> 01:26:15.069
Here's your checklist,
your maps,
all your golf shit.

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:16.571
All right.

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:18.072
Now, you got
everything, right?

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:19.699
You understand
all this?

01:26:19.699 --> 01:26:20.784
Yeah.

01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:22.077
All right.

01:26:22.077 --> 01:26:23.579
Thanks
for the lesson.

01:26:23.579 --> 01:26:24.788
Just come back,
all right?

01:26:41.265 --> 01:26:43.726
Pedals! Pedals!

01:26:46.187 --> 01:26:48.106
Collective!

01:26:48.106 --> 01:26:50.067
Shit!

01:26:50.067 --> 01:26:52.486
Up! Up! Up!

01:26:54.322 --> 01:26:59.035
OK, all right.
Torque, torque, torque.

01:27:01.622 --> 01:27:03.457
Get it up!

01:27:03.457 --> 01:27:07.128
You got it!
You got it! Up!

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:23.104
Who's that crazy
son of a bitch?!
Is that Clark?!

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:25.440
I believe
it is, sir.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.527
All right, Captain!

01:27:28.527 --> 01:27:31.238
We're looking at
a court-martial now!

01:27:31.238 --> 01:27:33.241
Rotor speed up.

01:27:33.241 --> 01:27:35.410
Throttle friction.

01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:41.250
Jesus Christ!

01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:43.753
When he gets
back here, Sergeant,

01:27:43.753 --> 01:27:45.755
I'm throwing his ass
in the stockade!

01:27:45.755 --> 01:27:47.590
We don't have
a stockade, sir.

01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:49.593
I'll build one!

01:27:49.593 --> 01:27:52.137
Son of a bitch!

01:28:00.855 --> 01:28:02.357
Good luck, Captain.

01:28:17.499 --> 01:28:21.754
All right, all right,
all right, here I come.

01:29:02.592 --> 01:29:05.095
Chopper Pilot,
this is Bat 21.

01:29:05.095 --> 01:29:06.596
This is
Chopper Pilot,

01:29:06.596 --> 01:29:09.057
above your signal
on the ninth hole.

01:29:09.057 --> 01:29:10.601
Is that you,
Birddog?

01:29:10.601 --> 01:29:12.186
Yeah, it's me.

01:29:12.186 --> 01:29:14.063
Now, let's get you
out of here.

01:29:14.063 --> 01:29:16.566
50 metres east
of you, there's
a small field.

01:29:16.566 --> 01:29:19.152
If I can get
into it, I can
make it happen.

01:29:19.152 --> 01:29:21.113
Copy that, Bat 21?

01:29:21.113 --> 01:29:23.657
I'm on my way,
Birddog.

01:30:12.671 --> 01:30:17.009
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

01:30:44.582 --> 01:30:46.501
Down!

01:31:03.812 --> 01:31:05.189
- Let's go!
<font color="#ffff00">- OK!</font>

01:31:16.493 --> 01:31:17.578
Hey!

01:31:17.578 --> 01:31:19.246
Hang on!

01:31:32.595 --> 01:31:34.180
Hurry up.

01:31:42.147 --> 01:31:44.400
All right!

01:31:49.489 --> 01:31:52.200
I'm glad to see you,
Birddog.

01:31:55.037 --> 01:31:57.998
Have a seat, Bat 21.

01:32:03.630 --> 01:32:06.466
You'd better
check the charts.

01:32:06.466 --> 01:32:09.178
I had
a hell of a time
navigating here.

01:32:12.098 --> 01:32:14.726
GUNFIRE

01:32:14.726 --> 01:32:16.186
Jesus!

01:32:20.107 --> 01:32:21.942
Shit!

01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:30.035
You're losing
oil pressure.

01:32:30.035 --> 01:32:31.953
Jesus.

01:32:36.125 --> 01:32:38.336
There's the river.

01:32:38.336 --> 01:32:39.963
We got to make it
from here.

01:32:39.963 --> 01:32:42.924
I'm going
to have to put
this baby down, OK?

01:32:45.636 --> 01:32:48.305
There's a clearing
at 9 o'clock.

01:33:24.138 --> 01:33:26.891
Cut into the woods!

01:33:28.768 --> 01:33:30.853
GUNFIRE

01:33:38.529 --> 01:33:40.197
Let's go!

01:33:59.135 --> 01:34:01.638
It's
the air strike.

01:34:01.638 --> 01:34:05.059
It's right
on time.

01:34:05.059 --> 01:34:06.143
Jesus!

01:34:07.854 --> 01:34:09.689
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

01:34:16.155 --> 01:34:19.033
Go! Move!

01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:32.741
Oh, shit!
Goddamn!

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.703
COUGHING

01:38:23.184 --> 01:38:27.189
You know, I've been
in the service...

01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:29.733
most of my adult life.

01:38:32.653 --> 01:38:35.198
It's the first time
I ever saw any war.

01:38:36.658 --> 01:38:40.704
Guess I was
a little closer
to the action.

01:38:40.704 --> 01:38:42.206
Aah...

01:38:42.206 --> 01:38:47.211
I've wanted to be
a fighter pilot
since I was a kid.

01:38:47.211 --> 01:38:50.340
But they
wouldn't let me
out of the O-2.

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:53.260
Lucky for me.

01:38:59.141 --> 01:39:02.228
You could have
quit anytime.

01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:05.690
Why'd you keep
coming back?

01:39:07.192 --> 01:39:10.154
Guess it's
the stubborn
side of me.

01:39:10.154 --> 01:39:13.199
I started out
just doing my job,

01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:15.201
no different
from you.

01:39:16.661 --> 01:39:19.373
I hate being told
I can't do something.

01:39:19.373 --> 01:39:23.252
I guess that's why
I'm still a captain.

01:39:25.212 --> 01:39:27.215
Besides...

01:39:27.215 --> 01:39:30.760
I started feeling
what you were
going through.

01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:35.099
I heard it
in your voice.

01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:43.733
DISTANT RUMBLING

01:39:58.208 --> 01:40:00.961

crap, OK, Birddog?

01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:13.684
It's
Iceal Hambleton.

01:40:13.684 --> 01:40:15.186
Iceal?

01:40:15.186 --> 01:40:16.687
Ha-ha-ha!

01:40:16.687 --> 01:40:18.189
Ha-ha-ha!

01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:20.191
It's Hamb.

01:40:20.191 --> 01:40:24.196
Yeah. Hey...
Clark Bartholomew.

01:40:24.196 --> 01:40:25.698
Bartholomew?

01:40:25.698 --> 01:40:27.199
Clarky.

01:40:27.199 --> 01:40:29.494
