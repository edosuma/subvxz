WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.350
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.393 --> 00:03.351
CAN I SHOW
YOU SOMETHING?

00:03.394 --> 00:05.570
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE AFRAID.

00:05.614 --> 00:07.572
BLOOD OF THE FIRST
COMMANDER IS YOUR BLOOD.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.792
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR
YOU TO SHARE THE VALLEY?

00:09.835 --> 00:11.576
DIYOZA, ON RADIO: SHORT OF
AN UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,

00:11.620 --> 00:12.447
NOTHING.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.883
ARKADIA WILL
NEVER SURRENDER.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.059
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GONNA TAKE HER OUT.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.543
OMON GON OSON.

00:21.586 --> 00:22.718
BELLAMY...

00:24.328 --> 00:26.330
WE'LL BE IN THE VALLEY.
WE'LL HAVE PEACE.

00:26.374 --> 00:30.030
75% OF YOUR PEOPLE ARE DYING.
YOU'RE ALREADY HAVING SYMPTOMS?

00:30.073 --> 00:31.292
SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.076
MURPHY: WE OFFERED
TO TRADE YOU FOR RAVEN,

00:33.120 --> 00:34.295
YET HERE YOU STILL ARE.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.471
DIYOZA SAID NO.
I CAN HELP YOU.

00:36.514 --> 00:37.776
I'M LISTENING.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.300
ABBY: ONE OF THE ABSCESSES
BROKE APART.

00:39.343 --> 00:42.694
IT WAS THE SOUND WAVES.
I CAN DISSOLVE THEM.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.305
I JUST NEED MORE POWER.

00:44.348 --> 00:47.090
VINSON: SONIC DRILL. IT USES
SOUND WAVES TO PULVERIZE ROCK.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.875
DIYOZA: WELL DONE, ABBY.
HOW SOON CAN YOU DO THE OTHERS?

00:49.919 --> 00:51.790
MAN ON RADIO:
COLONEL, IT'S MCCREARY.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.314
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOT PRISONERS.

00:53.357 --> 00:57.057
DIYOZA: YOU KEEP IT
TO YOURSELF FOR NOW.

01:09.286 --> 01:12.376
YOU COULD'VE BEEN
A MINER, DOC.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.248
MINERS DON'T CARE
ABOUT DESTROYING

01:14.291 --> 01:16.902
THE GROUND
THEY'RE DIGGING IN.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.817
I DID THAT, MY
PATIENT WOULD DIE,

01:18.861 --> 01:20.776
SO DON'T ASK ME TO
DO IT INTENTIONALLY

01:20.819 --> 01:22.038
BECAUSE I WON'T.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.954
VINSON:
COLONEL, INCOMING.

01:24.997 --> 01:28.305
DIYOZA: YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
HIDE THE MACHINE.

01:36.183 --> 01:39.055
DIYOZA: VINSON,
STAY OUT OF SIGHT.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.635
STILL ALIVE, I SEE.

01:53.678 --> 01:58.118
NO THANKS
TO YOU OR YOU.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.294
YOU SEEM UPSET,
MCCREARY,

02:00.337 --> 02:03.645
BUT YOU'D NEED FEELINGS
FOR THAT, SO--

02:09.129 --> 02:12.175
YOUR ERRAND BOY
LOOKS BETTER.

02:13.263 --> 02:16.484
SHOULD I BE
HOPEFUL?

02:16.527 --> 02:18.050
I'M NOT.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.662
ROBERT'S LUNGS FILLED
WITH FLUID THIS MORNING.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.490
HE ALMOST DROWNED.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.710
SAME THING IS GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOU SOON.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.886
DIYOZA: I CAME TO CHECK
ON HER PROGRESS, TOO.

02:27.930 --> 02:33.414
MAYBE WE SHOULD
LET HER DO HER JOB.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.330
MY PEOPLE KNOW
YOU DIDN'T TRADE FOR ME.

02:36.373 --> 02:39.289
SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN
CALLING FOR YOUR HEAD.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.899
WELL, THEN IT'S A
GOOD THING MY PEOPLE

02:40.943 --> 02:42.945
HAVE ALL THE GUNS.

02:42.988 --> 02:48.690
I HAD THEM LOCKED UP
WHEN YOU CAME HOME.

02:48.733 --> 02:53.390
ONE STEP AHEAD,
AS ALWAYS.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.176
VINSON: CROWDED.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.317
AM I EARLY?

03:07.361 --> 03:12.061
ABBY: NO, VINSON.
YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME.

03:12.888 --> 03:16.283
WE SHOULD
FINISH THIS LATER.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.076
HOW LONG DOES
HE HAVE LEFT?

03:27.119 --> 03:31.298
ABBY: UNTREATED,
A WEEK, MAYBE TWO,

03:31.341 --> 03:34.083
UNTIL THEN, WE ONLY TREAT
THE PEOPLE I TRUST.

03:34.126 --> 03:38.696
AFTER THAT, WE CURE
EVERYONE ELSE. DEAL?

03:40.698 --> 03:43.397
VINSON: TRUST ME, ABBY,
KILLING SOMEONE

03:43.440 --> 03:47.705
AND LETTING THEM DIE,
THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THING.

03:47.749 --> 03:51.709
DIYOZA: VINSON, PLEASE
GO GET THE MACHINE.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.192
THANK YOU.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.412
DIYOZA: CAREFUL, DOC.

03:58.455 --> 04:01.893
HE TOOK A THORN
OUT OF A LION'S FOOT,

04:01.937 --> 04:05.288
BUT HE'S STILL A LION.

04:05.332 --> 04:08.335
I'LL SEND IN
THE NEXT VICTIM.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.519
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HELPED CURE THEM.

04:18.562 --> 04:21.478
MURPHY: TAKE IT EASY.
THAT GUY LOOK CURED TO YOU?

04:21.522 --> 04:24.438
-MAYBE IT DIDN'T WORK.
-IT WORKED. SHE BUILT IT.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.440
EXACTLY. A WAR'S COMING,
AND YET SHE PASSES UP

04:26.483 --> 04:28.790
EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE
GET TO WEAKEN THE ENEMY.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.662
-QUIET.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.577
SHH.

04:33.621 --> 04:37.320
WE'RE STILL
ON THE SAME TEAM, RIGHT?

04:40.497 --> 04:42.456
RIGHT?

04:42.499 --> 04:47.374
GOOD. THEN WE'RE AGREED.
WE KILL THE PILOT.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.811
THEN WE POP OFF THESE COLLARS
AND RUN LIKE HELL.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.943
-NO.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.336
RAVEN: IF WE CAN
SLIP THE COLLARS,

04:53.380 --> 04:55.469
WE DON'T HAVE
TO KILL HIM.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.558
BESIDES, HE'S MORE
VALUABLE ALIVE.

04:57.601 --> 05:00.256
AS A SPY, YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.259
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT
A DEAD MAN CAN'T FLY A SHIP

05:03.303 --> 05:05.827
OR FIRE MISSILES
AT THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

05:05.870 --> 05:09.352
-INTEL.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.833
WE NEED A DISTRACTION
TO ESCAPE, RIGHT?

05:11.876 --> 05:13.269
ACCORDING TO SHAW,
THIS PLACE

05:13.313 --> 05:15.489
IS A CIVIL WAR
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.274
MCCREARY'S PEOPLE
HATE FOLLOWING DIYOZA.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.668
THEY ONLY DID IT
IN SPACE TO SURVIVE,

05:20.711 --> 05:22.017
BUT UP UNTIL THEN,

05:22.060 --> 05:25.020
MCCREARY WAS
THE ALPHA DOG.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.239
SHAW TOLD YOU ALL THIS?

05:27.283 --> 05:30.373
YOU WANT TO WEAKEN
THE ENEMY,

05:30.417 --> 05:34.072
WHAT'S WEAKER THAN AN
ENEMY AT WAR WITH ITSELF?

05:34.116 --> 05:36.858
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.730
WAR HAS A WAY OF HEALING
INTERNAL DIVISIONS.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.602
RAVEN: IF THEY WERE
SOLDIERS, I'D AGREE,

05:41.645 --> 05:42.994
BUT LOOK AT THEM.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.562
WHAT'S HE DOING?

05:45.606 --> 05:48.478
EMORI: HE'S BEING
JOHN MURPHY.

05:48.522 --> 05:52.439
THE TATTOO.
HE'S WITH MCCREARY.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.616
EVERYONE ELSE IN HERE
IS WITH DIYOZA.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.750
MAN: YOU SON
OF A BITCH.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.839
-HEY...
-UH!

06:02.927 --> 06:03.972
-YEAH!
-HELP!

06:04.015 --> 06:06.191
I AGREE WITH RAVEN.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.803
SHOULD BE FUN.

06:51.976 --> 06:55.589
-CLARKE.
-MADI.

06:55.632 --> 06:58.418
BELLAMY: SHE WAS READY
TO BURN THIS PLACE DOWN

06:58.461 --> 06:59.810
IF SHE COULDN'T
SEE YOU.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.552
THANK YOU FOR LETTING
ME SAY GOOD-BYE.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.860
BELLAMY: CLARKE,
THIS ISN'T GOOD-BYE.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.558
OCTAVIA'S SICK.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.473
THEY SAY SHE
MIGHT NOT WAKE UP.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.822
INDRA: OK, MADI.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.520
WE CAN'T RISK THE CHILD
BEING SEEN HERE.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.566
SHE'LL BE SAFE NOW,
AND SO WILL YOU.

07:20.788 --> 07:23.834
BE QUICK.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.714
WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:33.757 --> 07:36.281
MONTY'S ALGAE.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.718
OH, MY GOD.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.894
AS HEAD OF THE ARMY,
INDRA CAN ACCEPT

07:39.937 --> 07:41.983
DIYOZA'S TERMS
FOR PEACE.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.812
BY THE TIME OCTAVIA
WAKES UP,

07:44.855 --> 07:47.989
IF SHE WAKES UP--

07:48.032 --> 07:49.991
SHE WILL.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.384
YOU SAID THAT
MURPHY WAS FINE.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.474
HE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE A DOCTOR.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.998
I POISONED MY LITTLE
SISTER, CLARKE.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.175
HEY, I KNOW
THIS IS HARD,

08:00.218 --> 08:02.351
BUT SHE WAS WILLING
TO DESTROY

08:02.394 --> 08:04.005
THE LAST SURVIVABLE
LAND ON EARTH

08:04.048 --> 08:06.529
JUST TO WIN A WAR,

08:06.573 --> 08:09.576
NOT TO MENTION KILL
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.230
WELL, WE'RE
ALMOST THERE.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.537
INDRA'S ABOUT TO TAKE
OVER FOR OCTAVIA.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.713
ONCE WONKRU
SURRENDERS,

08:16.757 --> 08:18.715
I'LL COME AND
GET YOU OUT.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.152
WE'LL HEAD BACK
TO SHALLOW VALLEY

08:21.196 --> 08:24.068
TOGETHER.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.549
TOGETHER.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.598
-SHE'S GETTING WORSE.
-I KNOW.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.730
JACKSON: IF YOU'RE RIGHT
AND THERE'S SOMETHING

08:33.774 --> 08:36.037
IN HER BLOOD, DIALYSIS
SHOULD FILTER IT OUT.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.570
INDRA: HOW IS SHE?

08:47.614 --> 08:50.051
JACKSON: HER SYSTEMS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.792
NIYLAH: YOU WERE THERE.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.620
TELL US EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.578
DID SHE TAKE ANYTHING,
DRINK ANYTHING?

08:55.622 --> 08:56.927
BELLAMY: IT'S LIKE
I TOLD MILLER.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.321
SHE WAS EATING ONE
OF YOUR RATIONS. WHY?

08:59.364 --> 09:00.801
BECAUSE SHE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN POISONED.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.325
-THAT'S WHY.
-NIYLAH, THAT'S ENOUGH.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.674
SHE'S HIS SISTER.

09:04.718 --> 09:07.590
BELLAMY: WE WERE SHARING IT
THE WONKRU WAY.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.766
I ATE IT, TOO,
AND I'M FINE.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.638
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THAT THE WORM TOXIN

09:11.681 --> 09:13.770
MIGHT STILL BE
IN HER BLOOD?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.729
IT'S POSSIBLE,
MAKING THIS

09:15.772 --> 09:17.339
A SECONDARY REACTION
TO THE SUBSTANCE

09:17.382 --> 09:19.471
SHE WAS EXPOSED TO,
BUT A WEEK AGO--

09:19.515 --> 09:21.778
MILLER:
ENGLISH, JACKSON.

09:21.822 --> 09:25.869
DIALYSIS WON'T WORK.
NOTHING WILL.

09:27.392 --> 09:30.831
WE NEED TO PREPARE
FOR SUCCESSION.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.964
INDRA: I'LL INFORM WONKRU.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.618
IF THERE'S ANY CHANGE
IN HER CONDITION,

09:35.662 --> 09:37.968
I WANT TO BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.754
GATHER THE FIRST BATTALION
AND THE DELEGATES.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.191
NIYLAH: I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.343
THE WHISPERS ARE TRUE.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.869
OUR BELOVED BLODREINA
HAS FALLEN ILL.

10:08.912 --> 10:15.136
THESE MAY BE HER FINAL HOURS.
LISTEN TO ME.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.399
I TRAINED OCTAVIA AS MY SECOND,

10:17.442 --> 10:20.750
AND I LOVE HER
AS I LOVE MY OWN CHILD.

10:20.794 --> 10:25.886
I ADVISED HER,
AND LED HER ARMY WITH PRIDE.

10:25.929 --> 10:29.150
IT WAS HER DESIRE
THAT IF SHE SHOULD EVER FALL,

10:29.193 --> 10:33.415
I STEP FORWARD TO LEAD YOU.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.374
BLODREINA WANTED
WHAT WE ALL WANT--

10:36.418 --> 10:39.856
TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE
IN SHALLOW VALLEY,

10:39.900 --> 10:44.556
AND WE WILL,
BUT NOT THROUGH WAR,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.776
NOT WHEN THERE'S A BETTER WAY.

10:46.820 --> 10:50.780
FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS, WE HAVE
LOST HUNDREDS OF OUR PEOPLE.

10:50.824 --> 10:53.914
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE ANY MORE.

10:53.957 --> 10:58.745
I WILL NEGOTIATE FOR WONKRU
TO ENTER THE VALLEY PEACEFULLY

10:58.788 --> 11:01.748
SO THAT NO MORE SHALL SUFFER.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.664
MILLER: YOU'RE NOT
IN COMMAND HERE...

11:10.321 --> 11:12.759
NOT EVEN OVER
THE FIRST BATTALION.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.370
BLODREINA GAVE
THAT HONOR TO ME.

11:15.413 --> 11:19.156
BRELL: SO YOU EXPECT US
TO FOLLOW YOU? HE'S SKAIKRU.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.768
MILLER: THERE IS NO SKAIKRU.
YOU KNOW THAT.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.421
BRELL: IN THE ABSENCE
OF A COMMANDER,

11:23.465 --> 11:25.206
THE CLAN DELEGATES
SHOULD REASSEMBLE

11:25.249 --> 11:26.903
AND CHOOSE THE NEXT LEADER.

11:26.947 --> 11:29.645
MAN: BLASPHEMY.
MILLER'S RIGHT.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.214
THERE ARE NO MORE
CLANS, ONLY WONKRU

11:33.257 --> 11:35.477
AND ENEMIES
OF WONKRU.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.957
THAT'S FUNNY COMING
FROM SOMEONE

11:37.000 --> 11:39.873
WHO ONLY ESCAPED DEATH
IN THIS ARENA BECAUSE

11:39.916 --> 11:43.224
OUR REAL ENEMIES
FELL FROM THE SKY.

11:53.930 --> 11:57.455
NOW, I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO FOLLOW ME.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.893
I'M ASKING YOU TO FOLLOW
OCTAVIA.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.764
YESTERDAY SHE ORDERED US
TO MARCH ON THE VALLEY,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.636
SO WE MARCH FOR BLODREINA!

12:04.680 --> 12:07.639
CROWD: GON BLODREINA!
GON BLODREINA

12:07.683 --> 12:10.251
GON BLODREINA! GON BLODREINA!

12:10.294 --> 12:12.819
GON BLODREINA!
GON BLODREINA!

12:12.862 --> 12:14.298
INDRA...

12:14.342 --> 12:17.388
I CAN'T STOP
THIS WAR, BELLAMY,

12:17.432 --> 12:18.825
BUT THERE'S
SOMEONE WHO CAN.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.828
CROWD: GON BLODREINA!
GON BLODREINA!

12:21.871 --> 12:23.830
INDRA: WE NEED
A REAL COMMANDER.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.832
CROWD: GON BLODREINA!
GON BLODREINA!

12:25.875 --> 12:27.137
CLARKE:
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.400
CLARKE, YOU KNOW WHAT
A COMMANDER MEANS

12:29.444 --> 12:30.967
TO THE GROUNDERS.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.883
6 YEARS AGO, YOU TRIED TO
FORCE THE FLAME ON LUNA.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.493
YOU WERE WILLING TO PUT
IT IN YOUR OWN HEAD

12:35.537 --> 12:37.278
TO PREVENT A WAR
OVER THIS BUNKER.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.932
HOW IS THIS
ANY DIFFERENT?

12:38.975 --> 12:41.848
MADI'S A CHILD.
THAT'S HOW.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.284
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY
OF THESE PEOPLE

12:43.327 --> 12:44.894
STILL BELIEVE
IN THE FLAME.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.417
THEY BELIEVE IN
BLODREINA MORE.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.680
MADI WILL BE PROTECTED.
GAIA AND I--

12:48.724 --> 12:49.986
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
OCTAVIA WAKES UP?

12:50.030 --> 12:53.033
IF SHE WAKES UP, WE
WILL BE IN THE VALLEY,

12:53.076 --> 12:54.948
AND SHE WILL SEE
WHAT PEACE IS LIKE

12:54.991 --> 12:57.037
WITH HER OWN EYES, AND
SHE WILL UNDERSTAND.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.301
-I KNOW IT.
-THE ANSWER'S NO.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.825
NOW UNCHAIN ME SO WE CAN
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE

13:02.869 --> 13:06.829
BEFORE WE ALL GET
EXECUTED FOR TREASON.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.658
CLARKE...

13:09.701 --> 13:14.315
ECHO, RAVEN,
MURPHY, AND EMORI

13:14.358 --> 13:16.970
ARE MY FAMILY.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.363
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS HAPPENING.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.712
DON'T DO THIS,
BELLAMY.

13:20.756 --> 13:21.888
-BELLAMY,
-GUARD.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.672
YOU SAID THAT
YOU'D PROTECT HER.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.805
YOU SAID YOU'D
KEEP HER SAFE.

13:25.848 --> 13:30.200
BELLAMY!
AGH! YAAGH!

13:30.244 --> 13:33.421
NO! BELLAMY! WAIT!

13:33.464 --> 13:35.945
BELLAMY! NO! NO!

13:38.948 --> 13:40.515
MAN: YOU TWO CHECK
THE WESTERN PERIMETER.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.822
YOU 4 WITH ME AND KANE.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.844
OH, YOU LOOK HORRIBLE.

14:04.887 --> 14:10.675
BETTER GET
ON THAT TREATMENT.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.200
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.898
OH, OF COURSE NOT.
WHY WOULD SHE?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.509
SHE WANTS YOU DEAD.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.947
UH!

14:20.990 --> 14:25.081
-EXPLAIN.
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.083
LOOK. ALL I KNOW IS,
ABBY FOUND A CURE,

14:27.127 --> 14:28.215
RIGGED UP SOME KIND
OF MACHINE

14:28.258 --> 14:29.912
TO MELT THE CRAP
IN YOUR LUNGS.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.175
MY GUESS--DIYOZA'S CHOOSING
WHO LIVES AND DIES.

14:32.219 --> 14:36.440
YOU SEEM TO BE
ON THE WRONG LIST.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.969
IF WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS TRUE,

14:43.012 --> 14:45.188
YOU SHOULD GET
YOUR FRIENDS AND GO

14:45.232 --> 14:49.540
AS AGREED BEFORE
THE BLOODSHED STARTS.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.805
IF YOU'RE LYING...

14:55.329 --> 14:57.853
IT'LL BE YOUR BLOOD
THAT'S SHED.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.917
EMORI: GOD, YOUR
POKER FACE SUCKS.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.135
MURPHY: LISTEN TO ME.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.137
DIYOZA DIDN'T TELL MCCREARY
ABOUT THE CURE.

15:21.181 --> 15:24.924
I JUST DID. BAD THINGS
ARE ABOUT TO HAPPEN HERE.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.403
ECHO: NICE WORK,
MURPHY.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.928
I'LL TELL DIYOZA SO
HER SIDE IS READY.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.016
AS SOON AS THE
FIGHTING STARTS,

15:30.059 --> 15:34.063
GO TO WORK
ON THE COLLARS.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.286
THE PILOT'S, TOO.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.429
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

15:52.473 --> 15:54.170
JUST ONCE, I WISH
WE COULD HAVE

15:54.214 --> 15:58.000
A CASUAL
CONVERSATION.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.003
THIS ISN'T IT.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.006
WE'RE ESCAPING,
AND I WANT YOU

16:04.050 --> 16:05.529
TO COME WITH US.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.314
MY FRIEND EMORI KNOWS
HOW TO TAKE OFF THE COLLARS,

16:07.357 --> 16:09.359
-AND AS SOON AS SHE CAN--
-NO.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.100
SHAW, YOU'RE GONNA SAY
THAT YOU'RE STILL LOYAL

16:11.144 --> 16:12.493
TO DIYOZA AFTER
WHAT SHE DID TO YOU?

16:12.536 --> 16:15.235
IT'S NOT THAT, RAVEN.
I'M THEIR ONLY PILOT.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.019
THEY'LL NEVER STOP
LOOKING FOR ME.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.413
THAT MEANS YOU'LL
NEVER BE SAFE.

16:19.456 --> 16:22.329
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I CARE ABOUT THAT.

16:22.372 --> 16:26.811
MAYBE IT'S YOUR
EASYGOING CHARM.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.858
UH, LET ME PUT IT
TO YOU LIKE THIS, SHAW.

16:29.901 --> 16:34.210
EITHER YOU COME WITH US
OR WE'LL KILL YOU.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.299
HOW'S THAT
FOR EASYGOING?

16:36.343 --> 16:38.519
WE'LL HAVE
TO WORK ON IT...

16:38.562 --> 16:41.565
HA HA!

16:45.830 --> 16:47.963
BUT OK.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.358
I'M IN.

17:21.257 --> 17:24.391
INDRA: I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

17:31.963 --> 17:34.096
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
INTERRUPT YOUR PRAYERS.

17:34.140 --> 17:37.056
AS IT TURNS OUT,
I'M HERE TO ANSWER THEM.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.274
WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO, MOTHER,

17:38.318 --> 17:40.102
THAT SPEECH
IN THE ARENA?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.061
SUDDENLY, YOU'RE
A PEACEMAKER?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.150
REAL WARRIORS
HATE WAR, GAIA.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.368
AND YET ALL YOU
WANTED ME TO DO

17:45.412 --> 17:47.153
WAS FOLLOW
IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS.

17:47.196 --> 17:50.591
GET TO THE POINT.
WONKRU IS SET TO MARCH.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.115
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO GET YOUR WISH.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.596
SO ARE YOU.

17:55.639 --> 18:00.862
THE CHILD WITH CLARKE
IS A REAL NATBLIDA.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.126
YOU KNEW.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.476
I SAID,
GET TO THE POINT.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.827
GIVE MADI THE FLAME.
MAKE HER COMMANDER.

18:09.871 --> 18:16.660
SHE ALONE CAN UNIFY WONKRU
AND STOP THIS WAR.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.315
YOU DON'T COME TO ME
WITH FAITH.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.230
-THIS IS DESPERATION...
-GAIA...

18:21.274 --> 18:23.014
NOT TO MENTION TREASON,

18:23.058 --> 18:25.278
FOR WHICH WE BOTH BE
THROWN INTO THE PIT.

18:25.321 --> 18:30.152
NOT IF IT WORKS.
YOU QUESTION MY MOTIVES.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.893
IT'S TRUE.

18:31.936 --> 18:35.766
MY FAITH IS NOT
AS PURE AS YOURS,

18:35.810 --> 18:39.857
BUT YOU ARE AS RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT OCTAVIA BECAME

18:39.901 --> 18:41.381
AS I AM.

18:41.424 --> 18:45.124
BLODREINA WAS A LEADER
WE NEEDED THEN.

18:45.167 --> 18:48.170
WE NEED A TRUE
COMMANDER NOW.

18:48.214 --> 18:52.000
WILL YOU DO IT
OR NOT?

18:57.614 --> 18:59.877
THE DECISION
ISN'T MINE TO MAKE.

18:59.921 --> 19:04.447
THE CHILD MUST CHOOSE
FOR HERSELF.

19:22.857 --> 19:26.121
INDRA: I'LL CHECK
ON OCTAVIA.

19:36.958 --> 19:41.745
MADI, DO YOU KNOW WHY
THEY BROUGHT YOU HERE?

19:44.313 --> 19:48.448
BELLAMY:
HEY, MADI, IT'S OK.

19:48.491 --> 19:51.364
IT'S OK.
NO ONE'S GONNA HURT YOU.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.843
GAIA: I TOLD YOU,

19:52.887 --> 19:56.934
I WOULD NEVER FORCE THIS
ON YOU, AND I WON'T,

19:56.978 --> 19:58.501
BUT THERE ARE THINGS
HAPPENING NOW

19:58.545 --> 19:59.981
THAT THEY BELIEVE
ONLY THE WISDOM

20:00.024 --> 20:01.461
OF THE COMMANDERS
CAN SAVE US FROM,

20:01.504 --> 20:04.203
AND AS MUCH AS I WISH
IT WASN'T SO,

20:04.246 --> 20:05.508
I BELIEVE IT, TOO.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.554
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE WAR.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.860
BUT YOU'VE BEEN
TEACHING US TO FIGHT.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.515
BELLAMY: SOME FIGHTS
AREN'T WORTH FIGHTING, MADI,

20:12.559 --> 20:14.735
NOT WHEN THERE'S
ANOTHER WAY.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.259
CLARKE MADE A DEAL
WITH DIYOZA FOR PEACE,

20:17.303 --> 20:21.350
AND OCTAVIA'S TOO SICK
TO ACCEPT IT NOW,

20:21.394 --> 20:23.700
BUT WONKRU WON'T FOLLOW
ANYONE ELSE.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.486
MADI: WAIT. CLARKE
KNOWS ABOUT THIS?

20:26.529 --> 20:30.141
YEAH.
SHE DOESN'T APPROVE.

20:30.185 --> 20:33.232
NO. SHE WOULDN'T.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.538
BELLAMY,
IF I DO THIS,

20:35.582 --> 20:37.236
SHE'LL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.499
-MADI--
-JUST WAIT.

20:39.542 --> 20:44.112
WHAT HAPPENS TO CLARKE
IF I DON'T DO THIS?

20:47.507 --> 20:50.466
BELLAMY: MADI, I HATE
TO PUT THIS ONE YOU.

20:50.510 --> 20:54.427
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE
I COULD DO, I WOULD,

20:54.470 --> 20:56.559
BUT THIS IS HOW
WE STOP THE WAR.

20:56.603 --> 20:59.258
THIS IS HOW WE SAVE
THAT VALLEY,

20:59.301 --> 21:02.478
YOUR HOME,
AND MY FRIENDS.

21:02.522 --> 21:06.221
THIS IS HOW
WE SAVE CLARKE.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.541
YOU'RE RIGHT
ON TIME.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.194
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO CALL FOR YOU.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.022
WHAT'S WRONG?
-NOTHING, THE OPPOSITE.

21:25.066 --> 21:29.200
DIALYSIS IS WORKING.
HER PULSE IS STABILIZING.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.898
SHE'S WAKING UP.

21:30.941 --> 21:35.294
HEY, OCTAVIA,
CAN YOU HEAR ME? OCTAVIA.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.382
MM...

21:36.425 --> 21:42.431
HEY, OCTAVIA, HEY,
INDRA IS HERE, TOO.

21:42.475 --> 21:43.737
HMM?

21:43.780 --> 21:46.348
YOU HAD US ALL
SO WORRIED.

21:46.392 --> 21:50.526
-I'M RIGHT HERE.

21:53.529 --> 21:57.751
INDRA, MY BROTHER
POISONED ME.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.450
I'LL TAKE
CARE OF HER.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.322
YOU NEED TO
ARREST BELLAMY.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.802
I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO THAT.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.328
-UH!
-UGH!

22:09.371 --> 22:10.459
UGH...

22:10.503 --> 22:13.332
-UH!
-HUH! UH!

22:13.375 --> 22:15.334
OHH....

22:15.377 --> 22:16.422
UHH...

22:20.426 --> 22:24.168
NO ONE IS LEAVING
THIS ROOM.

22:34.788 --> 22:37.181
DIYOZA: WHAT'S WRONG?

22:37.225 --> 22:40.271
ECHO: MCCREARY KNOWS
ABOUT THE CURE.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.844
CODE BLUE, BOYS AND GIRLS.
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

22:47.888 --> 22:51.413
LOCK IT UP.
EVERYBODY, WEAPONS HOT.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.895
MAN: MOVE IT.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.464
EMORI:
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

22:58.507 --> 23:04.121
FIRST, THE PANEL,
GENTLY LIKE THIS.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.080
RAVEN: SORRY
IN ADVANCE IF I--

23:07.690 --> 23:10.127
NNGH!

23:10.171 --> 23:11.259
CODE BLUE?

23:11.302 --> 23:12.434
MCCREARY WILL GO
FOR THE DOCTOR,

23:12.478 --> 23:13.870
SO WE'LL
GET THERE FIRST.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.872
GEOTAG ALL THE DEFECTORS
TO THE CHURCH FOR NOW.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.657
YOU GOT 5 MINUTES
TO GET THERE.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.530
IF THIS GOES SIDEWAYS, WE'LL
BRING YOU ALL TO THE SHIP.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.881
ECHO: WHAT ABOUT THE
DEFECTORS WHO WENT

23:24.925 --> 23:26.622
WITH KANE TO MAP
THE SETTLEMENT?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.058
KANE KNOWS WHAT
CODE BLUE MEANS.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.409
AFTER WE ROLL UP ABBY,
WE GO FOR SHAW.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.454
COPY THAT.

23:52.953 --> 23:56.609
THAT'S A LOT OF FIREPOWER
FOR A DOCTOR'S VISIT.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.611
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

23:58.654 --> 24:00.961
COME ON, MCCREARY.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.616
WE DIDN'T COME ALL
THE WAY BACK TO EARTH

24:03.659 --> 24:06.445
JUST TO KILL
EACH OTHER.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.578
WE CAME TO LIVE...

24:10.579 --> 24:12.276
AND NOW WE CAN...

24:13.452 --> 24:15.497
DIYOZA: BECAUSE OUR NEW DOCTOR
HAS SUCCEEDED

24:15.541 --> 24:17.412
IN FINDING US A CURE.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.761
WE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU
UNTIL WE WERE...

24:18.805 --> 24:20.154
WHAT'S
DIYOZA SAYING?

24:20.197 --> 24:21.721
SHE'S TELLING THEM
ABOUT THE CURE,

24:21.764 --> 24:23.679
DEFUSING THE BOMB
WITH THE TRUTH.

24:23.723 --> 24:27.117
GOT TO SAY,
SHE'S GOOD.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.772
YEAH? WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

24:35.691 --> 24:36.953
MCCREARY: SHE'S LYING.

24:36.997 --> 24:39.478
SHE WAS NEVER GONNA TREAT
ANY OF US,

24:39.521 --> 24:42.481
ONLY HER PEOPLE.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.613
GO ON. TELL THEM.

24:44.657 --> 24:47.529
TELL THEM THAT YOU
WERE PLANNING

24:47.573 --> 24:50.619
TO LET US DIE
SO THAT YOU

24:50.663 --> 24:52.926
COULD MAKE MORE ROOM
FOR YOUR SAVAGES.

24:52.969 --> 24:56.538
NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING PARANOID.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.280
AM I?

24:59.323 --> 25:01.500
WHAT IS YOUR FRIEND
KANE WORKING ON

25:01.543 --> 25:04.677
IN THE SOUTH WOODS?

25:04.720 --> 25:08.768
A SETTLEMENT
FOR ALL OF US,

25:08.811 --> 25:11.510
A PLACE WHERE
WE CAN REBUILD,

25:11.553 --> 25:13.990
START OVER.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.689
ONCE ALL OF YOU ARE CURED,
YOU'LL EACH GET

25:16.732 --> 25:19.605
A PLOT OF LAND
TO CALL YOUR OWN.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.521
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

25:24.610 --> 25:29.484
MUST I ALWAYS DO
EVERYTHING MYSELF?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.181
OH!

25:37.274 --> 25:38.624
NO!

25:41.409 --> 25:43.585
NO! NO! KNOCK IT OFF!

25:49.635 --> 25:52.028
AAGH!

25:54.509 --> 25:57.817
THIS IS MY MASTERPIECE.

26:05.607 --> 26:09.219
LET'S GO, PEOPLE.
I DID MY PART.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.700
JUST ONE MORE WIRE.
GOT IT.

26:11.744 --> 26:15.138
ALL RIGHT. YOU ALL KNOW
WHERE THE MEETING POINT IS.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.618
IF ANYONE GETS SPLIT UP,
GO THERE.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.968
WE'LL COME FIND YOU
AND BRING YOU TO THE CAVE.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.015
KANE: GOOD.
YOU'RE ALL HERE.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.712
WE NEED TO GET
ABBY AND DIYOZA

26:23.756 --> 26:25.322
AND GET TO THE
TRANSPORT SHIP.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.324
THE OTHER DEFECTORS
ARE THERE ALREADY.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.065
ECHO: ABBY WILL BE FINE.
THEY WON'T HURT THEIR DOCTOR.

26:29.109 --> 26:33.635
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DIYOZA
IS NOT OUR CONCERN.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.899
-THERE'S NO TIME. MOVE OUT.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.510
IS PEACE
YOUR CONCERN?

26:39.554 --> 26:42.296
BELLAMY AND CLARKE
NEGOTIATED A SURRENDER.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.732
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON A SETTLEMENT

26:43.776 --> 26:45.125
FOR EVERYONE
IN THE SOUTH WOODS.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.910
WITHOUT DIYOZA,
THAT ALL GOES AWAY.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.347
WHOOPS.

26:50.391 --> 26:53.176
-I'LL GO WITH YOU.
-NO WAY.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.743
OCTAVIA WOULD
NEVER SURRENDER.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.658
WE LEAVE AS PLANNED.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.965
RAVEN, TAKE HIM
AND GO RIGHT NOW,

26:59.008 --> 27:00.531
OR I SLIT
HIS THROAT.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.969
STOP TALKING
AND DO IT ALREADY.

27:03.012 --> 27:07.451
RAVEN: SHAW, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.893
I'M GOING WITH KANE.

27:13.936 --> 27:16.678
EMORI:
JOHN, NOT AGAIN.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.768
IT'S ABBY.
I HAVE TO.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.346
UH! UH!

27:36.698 --> 27:38.352
UH!

27:44.184 --> 27:46.360
YOU TWO, WITH ME.

27:46.403 --> 27:48.449
MAN: LET'S GO.
COME ON.

27:52.322 --> 27:55.674
-ABBY.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.676
-IT'S ALREADY STOWED.

27:57.719 --> 28:00.069
GOOD. WE NEED TO GET
YOU TO THE SHIP.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.941
I'M GONNA TAKE
HER OUT BACK.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.725
UH!

28:04.900 --> 28:05.988
DAMN IT.

28:06.032 --> 28:10.166
IT'S OK. IF I DIE,
THE CURE DIES WITH ME.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.733
MCCREARY: YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:11.777 --> 28:16.695
WE'RE NOT GONNA KILL YOU,
BUT YOU'LL WISH WE DID.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.914
TAKE HER.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.786
RUN, ABBY.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.791
-AAGH!
-RRGH!

28:30.926 --> 28:31.840
OH!

28:37.890 --> 28:40.849
YAAH! HUH! UHH!

28:40.893 --> 28:42.808
HUH! UH!

28:47.900 --> 28:49.858
AAGH...

28:49.902 --> 28:51.686
MCCREARY: UHH!

28:53.906 --> 28:55.777
AAGH!

28:55.821 --> 28:57.823
HRRAGH!

28:59.085 --> 29:00.869
UGH!

29:00.913 --> 29:03.785
YAH! AGH...

29:03.829 --> 29:05.047
NNGH...

29:07.920 --> 29:10.400
YOU KILL ME,

29:10.444 --> 29:13.969
YOU WILL KILL
YOUR UNBORN CHILD.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.885
AAGH!

29:21.803 --> 29:22.804
OH...

29:22.848 --> 29:25.546
IT'S A GIRL,
BY THE WAY.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.983
UHH!

29:33.946 --> 29:35.077
MCCREARY: UGH...

29:36.731 --> 29:37.819
UGH!

29:37.863 --> 29:39.386
MURPHY: MCCREARY'S PEOPLE
ARE IN CONTROL.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.866
-WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.999
THEY TOOK HER,
BUT SHE'LL BE OK.

29:44.043 --> 29:48.438
THERE'S MORE COMING.

29:53.879 --> 29:54.923
NNGH!

29:59.580 --> 30:02.061
BRING BACK THE DOCTOR...

30:02.104 --> 30:05.325
NOW.

30:11.635 --> 30:15.030
TELL ME WHY.

30:15.074 --> 30:18.642
DIYOZA AGREED
TO SHARE THE VALLEY

30:18.686 --> 30:19.905
IF WE SURRENDER.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.820
SURRENDER.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.865
SO YOU'RE NOT
JUST A TRAITOR.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.867
YOU'RE A COWARD.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.696
I'M ASHAMED OF YOU.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.873
AND I'M AFRAID
OF YOU,

30:31.917 --> 30:33.875
OF WHAT
YOU'VE BECOME.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.095
I BLAME MYSELF
FOR THAT.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.184
I LET YOU GO
TOO FAR.

30:38.227 --> 30:40.186
THE DARK YEAR
BROKE US ALL.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.842
DO NOT TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE DARK YEAR.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.935
WE SURVIVED THAT.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.937
WE CAN SURVIVE
THIS, TOO.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.201
WE SURVIVED THAT
BECAUSE OF ME.

30:55.244 --> 30:58.160
YOU STOOD THERE
AND WATCHED.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.120
YES. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET YOU

31:01.163 --> 31:03.383
SHOULDER THAT
BURDEN ALONE.

31:03.426 --> 31:07.126
I WON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE NOW.

31:16.178 --> 31:19.007
THE ASCENSION CALL.

31:19.051 --> 31:21.140
WONKRU WOULDN'T
FOLLOW YOU,

31:21.183 --> 31:23.011
SO YOU'RE
USING MADI?

31:23.055 --> 31:24.970
-YES.
-SHE'S A CHILD.

31:25.013 --> 31:28.451
SHE'S THE SAME AGE LEXA
WAS WHEN SHE ASCENDED.

31:28.495 --> 31:31.628
SOON, WONKRU WILL ACCEPT
THEIR NEW LEADER

31:31.672 --> 31:32.934
AND SURRENDER.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.023
OUR PEOPLE WILL
REACH THAT VALLEY

31:35.067 --> 31:39.071
WITHOUT SACRIFICING
ANY MORE LIVES...

31:43.031 --> 31:46.426
AND YOU WILL SEE
THE WISDOM IN IT.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.179
NIYLAH:
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

32:00.222 --> 32:02.181
YOU SWORE TO ME
MADI WOULD NEVER ASCEND.

32:02.224 --> 32:07.142
THANK GOD. WE HAVE
TO STOP IT. PLEASE.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.492
YOU'RE NOT
BEHIND THIS.

32:09.536 --> 32:12.017
NO. IT'S INDRA
AND BELLAMY.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.932
THEY POISONED
OCTAVIA,

32:13.975 --> 32:16.847
AND NOW THEY WANT
TO REPLACE HER.

32:16.891 --> 32:19.763
NIYLAH, WAIT.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.069
GUARD,
I'M DONE HERE.

32:21.113 --> 32:22.505
NIYLAH, PLEASE.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.290
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
LOYAL TO OCTAVIA,

32:24.333 --> 32:26.857
BUT WE BOTH WANT
THE SAME THING--

32:26.901 --> 32:29.425
TO STOP
THE ASCENSION.

32:32.907 --> 32:35.649
-UH!
-AGH! OOH!

32:35.692 --> 32:37.607
-UH!
-OHH!

32:42.047 --> 32:43.874
HE'S ONE OF INDRA'S.

32:43.918 --> 32:46.442
OH. THANK YOU.

32:49.489 --> 32:51.186
AH!

32:53.841 --> 32:57.453
DON'T MAKE ME
REGRET THIS.

32:58.933 --> 33:01.457
WHERE ARE THEY?

33:11.119 --> 33:12.773
NIYLAH: SHE'S IN THERE,

33:12.816 --> 33:15.645
BUT THE FAITHFUL
ARE ALREADY GATHERING.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.996
WE HAVE TO GET TO THEM
BEFORE THE PUT THE FLAME

33:18.039 --> 33:19.954
IN HER HEAD.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.738
NO. THERE'S
TOO MANY OF THEM.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.914
EVERYONE HERE
WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.177
TELL ME
THE TRUTH, NIYLAH.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.702
WILL WONKRU FOLLOW
A REAL COMMANDER?

33:28.745 --> 33:30.225
THEY MIGHT.

33:30.269 --> 33:33.185
AS LONG AS OCTAVIA
HOLDS POWER,

33:33.228 --> 33:36.753
MADI WON'T BE SAFE,
AND I'M AFRAID

33:36.797 --> 33:40.583
OUR TRUE BELIEVERS
HAVE ALL THE GUNS.

33:43.586 --> 33:44.979
CLARKE.

34:00.908 --> 34:04.564
GAIA:
DON'T BE AFRAID.

34:16.271 --> 34:20.884
CLARKE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE? GET OUT.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.670
SHE'S HERE TO KILL ME.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.238
I CAN'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO MADI.

34:40.861 --> 34:43.211
ASCENDE SUPERIUS.

34:44.299 --> 34:47.650
OCTAVIA: I AM SURPRISED.

34:47.694 --> 34:50.349
CLARKE I KNEW
WOULD'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.264
YOU KILL ME,
MY PEOPLE KILL YOU.

34:52.307 --> 34:56.920
MADI STILL ASCENDS.
THEY COME AFTER HER.

34:56.964 --> 34:59.314
IT'S LOSE-LOSE...

35:07.017 --> 35:09.107
AAH! AAH!

35:09.150 --> 35:10.195
OR WE BOTH CAN WIN.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.327
INDRA: WHAT IS
THIS NONSENSE?

35:12.371 --> 35:13.763
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

35:13.807 --> 35:16.026
THE ONLY PERSON WHO WANTS
MADI TO BE COMMANDER

35:16.070 --> 35:21.206
LESS THAN ME IS YOU.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.166
BELLAMY: CLARKE
WOKE UP RIGHT AWAY.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.603
WHY--WHY ISN'T
SHE WAKING UP?

35:27.647 --> 35:28.865
PATIENCE.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.259
THE FLAME AFFECTS EVERY
COMMANDER DIFFERENTLY.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.522
-HELP ME.
-YES.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.399
YOU SAID YOU'D
NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.314
I HAVEN'T,
BUT I'VE BEEN

35:42.357 --> 35:44.359
PREPARING FOR IT
MY WHOLE LIFE.

35:44.403 --> 35:47.754
THIS COLLAR WILL
PROTECT THE FLAME.

35:49.451 --> 35:53.238
MILLER: BACK AWAY
FROM THE CHILD RIGHT NOW.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.861
UH!

36:10.211 --> 36:12.822
I NEED TO GET IT OUT.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.433
CLARKE, NO.

36:14.476 --> 36:15.738
THE FLAME IS BONDING
WITH HER MIND.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.218
IF YOU TAKE IT OUT NOW
BEFORE IT'S COMPLETE

36:17.262 --> 36:19.351
SHE MAY NEVER
WAKE UP.

36:19.394 --> 36:22.832
OCTAVIA: QUIET, TRAITOR.
DO IT, CLARKE.

36:22.876 --> 36:27.315
GAIA: IF YOU KILL THIS CHILD,
YOU MAKE HER A MARTYR.

36:27.359 --> 36:30.449
YOU WEAKEN YOURSELF
EVEN MORE.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.800
I CAN'T.

36:36.237 --> 36:39.893
TAKE THEM TO THE ROVER.
GO.

36:40.981 --> 36:43.505
-NO.
-O--

36:55.343 --> 36:59.347
OCTAVIA:
ARREST THE TRAITORS.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.546
MCCREARY: HEAR ME.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.899
WE'RE NOT FINISHED HERE.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.467
WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE.

37:33.512 --> 37:36.079
THERE ARE TRAITORS
IN THESE WOODS,

37:36.123 --> 37:38.517
OUR PILOT AMONGST THEM.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.041
WE STILL HAVE THE DOCTOR.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.391
THAT MEANS WE HAVE THE CURE.

37:43.435 --> 37:46.351
ONCE HEALED, WE WILL FIND SHAW,

37:46.394 --> 37:49.354
AND WE WILL KILL THE REST,

37:49.397 --> 37:52.182
AND THEN WE'LL DO
WHAT DIYOZA SHOULD HAVE DONE

37:52.226 --> 37:53.749
FROM DAY ONE--

37:53.793 --> 37:58.493
EXTERMINATE THE SAVAGES
THAT WOULD TAKE OUR LAND.

37:58.537 --> 38:02.889
OUR LAND! OUR LAND!

38:02.932 --> 38:04.107
YEAH!

38:06.501 --> 38:11.506
ROBERT, WHY
AREN'T YOU SMILING?

38:11.550 --> 38:14.030
WORRIED ABOUT THAT
THING IN YOUR CHEST?

38:14.074 --> 38:17.033
NOPE. ALREADY CURED.

38:17.077 --> 38:20.994
OH, NOT THAT THING.

38:21.037 --> 38:24.040
AAGH!

38:33.354 --> 38:35.313
THE DOCTOR'S IN.

38:35.356 --> 38:38.490
CROWD: YEAH!

38:50.240 --> 38:52.591
THERE IT IS.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.432
CLARKE.

39:07.475 --> 39:12.611
HI. YOU'RE OK.
I'M HERE.

39:16.528 --> 39:20.445
CLARKE: NO. NO. PLEASE.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.143
WE HAD A DEAL.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.798
THESE ARE
MY ORDERS.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.539
GON BLODREINA.

39:27.582 --> 39:30.585

DOWN, JOROUM.

39:45.165 --> 39:48.560
YOU BELIEVED IN HER.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.650
NOW BELIEVE IN ME.

39:59.092 --> 40:01.094
HEDA.

40:03.270 --> 40:06.142
WHY DID YOU
DO THAT?

40:06.186 --> 40:07.666
YOU KNOW WHY.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.886
CLARKE, IF WE RUN,
OCTAVIA WINS.

40:10.930 --> 40:14.150
GAIA, INDRA, AND
BELLAMY WILL DIE.

40:14.194 --> 40:16.631
THEY MADE
THEIR CHOICE.

40:47.706 --> 40:51.666
THE NIGHTBLOOD CHILD
DID NOT RECITE THE LINEAGE

40:51.710 --> 40:54.190
AND IS, THEREFORE,
NOT THE TRUE COMMANDER.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.714
INSTEAD, SHE RAN,

40:55.757 --> 41:02.198
ABANDONING ALL OF US
LIKE A COWARD.

41:02.242 --> 41:03.939
SHE IS NOT WONKRU.

41:03.983 --> 41:09.641
SHE IS AN ENEMY OF WONKRU,
AND LIKE ALL OF OUR ENEMIES...

41:12.252 --> 41:14.602
SHE WILL BE DEALT WITH...

41:22.044 --> 41:24.438
