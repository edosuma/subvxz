WEBVTT

01:00.375 --> 01:02.791
I got you, Sensei. Stay with me.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.500
You're a life saver, Casey Jones.

01:06.125 --> 01:09.208
I learned from the best.
Come on, we're almost there.

01:20.791 --> 01:22.083
Bad doggies!

01:24.083 --> 01:27.125
Impeccable timing, little brother.
Very dramatic.

01:40.458 --> 01:43.541
Help him, Michelangelo. He's hurt bad.

01:55.208 --> 01:58.666
That's it. The resistance failed.
The Krang won.

01:59.458 --> 02:00.833
But… but it isn't over.

02:00.916 --> 02:03.416
We've still got a ninja's greatest weapon…

02:03.500 --> 02:04.500
hope.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.541
That and a badass mystic warrior.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.833
Mikey, we need a time gateway.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.833
It'll take everything I have.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.625
I know, but this is our last chance.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.125
It's our only chance.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.500
Hm.

02:22.833 --> 02:26.208
-Wait, what's going on? Where is he going?
-Casey, listen.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.416
The Krang first came to our planet
through a mystic doorway.

02:42.041 --> 02:44.875
The key that opened the doorway
looked like this.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.333
Why are you telling me this?

02:48.416 --> 02:50.541
Because Mikey's
about to send you back in time

02:50.625 --> 02:52.750
to the day that the key was stolen.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.375
Wait, he's gonna what?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.375
The people who stole that key
opened the doorway for the Krang.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.333
You have to find it before that happens.

03:13.416 --> 03:15.625
Find the key, stop the Krang.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.833
-But, Sensei--
-Say it!

03:18.916 --> 03:21.333
"Find the key, stop the Krang."

03:23.875 --> 03:25.708
I don't want to lose you.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.625
Casey, it's not about me.

03:32.875 --> 03:33.833
They found us!

03:37.458 --> 03:38.541
Mikey!

03:51.166 --> 03:53.250
Master Michelangelo, no! You're gonna--

04:16.833 --> 04:17.833
Casey…

04:19.333 --> 04:22.166
when you're done saving the world,
do me a favor.

04:23.666 --> 04:25.375
Grab a slice!

04:42.541 --> 04:43.541
Huh?

04:44.625 --> 04:46.541
-Where…

04:46.625 --> 04:47.666
I made it?

04:50.916 --> 04:54.458
All right, Casey, here we go.
Find the key, stop the Krang.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.583
Easy does it, Leo.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.083
You've got this.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.291
Concentrate.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.000
The whole world is counting on you…

05:18.625 --> 05:22.333
to break the pizza box stack record!

05:23.208 --> 05:25.416
One-hundred, twenty-five boxes!

05:25.500 --> 05:29.375
They say it couldn't be done,
but look who's doing it, moi.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.000
That's Spanish for Leo.

05:31.083 --> 05:35.791
Go ahead, my non-lingual friend,
count your unhatched fowl.

05:35.875 --> 05:38.458
My record stands until you reach the top,

05:38.541 --> 05:41.458
which, according to
my calculations of wind speed,

05:41.541 --> 05:45.083
barometric pressure, and dew point,
is highly unlikely. What?

05:45.166 --> 05:48.208
According to my calculations,

05:48.291 --> 05:51.875
as long as you believe in yourself,
you can do anything!

05:52.458 --> 05:56.541
Thanks, little brother.
No one believes in himself more than me.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.041
Leo!

05:58.125 --> 06:03.125
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!

06:03.208 --> 06:07.750
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!

06:10.458 --> 06:13.208
-Yeah! I am Leo!
-Yeah, baby!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.250
There you are.

06:15.916 --> 06:17.958
I've been looking all over for you guys.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.041
Raph, guess who just broke the record?

06:20.125 --> 06:22.958
What? You did? How many did you--

06:23.041 --> 06:26.333
Stop distracting Raph!
We were supposed to be training--

06:26.416 --> 06:28.375
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Hold that thought.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.375
Donnie?

06:30.458 --> 06:31.833
Donnie?

06:33.541 --> 06:36.375
You, sir, have bested me. Mazel.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.666
-Ahem?
-Ahem?

06:40.291 --> 06:42.916
Leo. Leo.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.875
Leo! Leo!

06:44.958 --> 06:46.125
Stop it!

06:46.791 --> 06:50.125
Leo, we have work to do,
and you dragged him out here for this?

06:50.708 --> 06:54.500
Training, record-breaking.
The choice was clear.

06:54.583 --> 06:58.541
Dang it, Leo.
Everything's not about you.

06:58.625 --> 07:01.250
When are you gonna grow up
and start acting like a hero?

07:01.333 --> 07:04.500
And there it is. Gentlemen…

07:04.583 --> 07:08.500
-What was that? What are you guys doing?
-A little game I invented.

07:08.583 --> 07:11.791
Every time you say "heroes,"
we take a bite of pizza.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.625
I don't say "heroes" that often!

07:15.208 --> 07:16.041
Leo!

07:16.125 --> 07:19.083
So what if I say he-- that word a lot.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.958
It's a good word. We need to be that word.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.625
Relax, Raph.
We've got this hero thing wired.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.916
I mean, our ninjocity is off the charts.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.791
We've got some kickin' mystic weapons.

07:30.583 --> 07:35.041
And do I need to remind you who has
four shells and defeated the Shredder?

07:36.416 --> 07:37.791
-Hey.
-Leo!

07:39.291 --> 07:41.041
You just don't get it.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.083
-Huh? What is all that-- That's me.

07:43.958 --> 07:47.041
Looks like we have a 317-39.4 in progress!

07:47.125 --> 07:49.750
Uh-huh?

07:49.833 --> 07:50.666
Oh, come on!

07:50.750 --> 07:54.166
Has nobody read Donnie's Big Book
of Bad Guy Codes? Nobody?

07:54.250 --> 07:55.791
-Nope.
-Never gonna happen.

07:59.166 --> 08:02.291
We did it!
We got the whatcha-ma-hoosie-doodle!

08:02.375 --> 08:03.458
Of course we did.

08:03.541 --> 08:06.625
Nothing can stop Supervillain Warren Stone

08:06.708 --> 08:09.375
and his conjuring compatriot,
Hypno-Potamus!

08:12.958 --> 08:15.291
There they are! Okay, here's the plan--

08:15.375 --> 08:19.875
Raph, relax. Who needs a plan
when we got crazy cool mystic powers?

08:19.958 --> 08:20.791
Leo!

08:22.333 --> 08:25.000
Come on, swords, it's portal time!

08:25.083 --> 08:28.208
I'll see you guys later
after I save the day! Buh-buh-bye!

08:28.291 --> 08:30.583
Stop! We need to work together!

08:37.000 --> 08:40.541
Wellington Sunday!
It's those pesky Turtles.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.666
License and registration.

08:42.750 --> 08:46.291
Oh, I'm sorry, mate.
I must have left it in my other jacket.

08:50.916 --> 08:51.916
Leo! Ah!

08:53.250 --> 08:54.791
Leo, we're coming.

08:54.875 --> 08:58.416
Don't worry.
I got 'em right where I want 'em.

08:58.500 --> 09:02.916
Doesn't look that way to me.
Donnie, Mikey, Maneuver 12.

09:03.541 --> 09:04.875
-On it!
-Ha!

09:05.500 --> 09:07.250
Whip-o-rama!

09:17.791 --> 09:20.583
Prepare to be Donnie'd by my mystic tech!

09:34.416 --> 09:35.875
Oh boy.

09:39.041 --> 09:42.250
Okay, creeps, hand over the stolen thingy!

09:42.791 --> 09:43.708
Oh no.

09:46.208 --> 09:48.125
That's gotta be what they stole!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I got it!

09:50.083 --> 09:53.666
With those clumsy hands?
No, I got this one.

10:06.708 --> 10:09.541
Oh, you portal-chopped him!

10:09.625 --> 10:13.333
"Portal-chopped," I like it.
Maybe my new catchphrase?

10:13.416 --> 10:16.791
Okay, let's see how it fits.
"You've been portal chopped!"

10:22.916 --> 10:26.166
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
I'll be taking this.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.208
The Foot Clan?

10:31.291 --> 10:35.875
Finally, after all these centuries,
this is ours.

10:35.958 --> 10:39.500
Yes, well, of course, thanks to us,
delivered safe and sound.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.250
No problemo, partner.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.250
Hey, just quietly, are we partners?
We are partners, yeah?

10:49.583 --> 10:54.041
Oh man, that thing must be dangerous
if the Foot Clan wants it.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.166
Ya think?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.125
Huh? What?

11:00.833 --> 11:05.833
I clearly said, "I got it."
Everybody heard me say, "I got it."

11:05.916 --> 11:08.958
Yeah, but I got it with style.

11:09.041 --> 11:11.000
But you didn't get it!

11:11.083 --> 11:16.000
You lost it, and now
we've got a Foot Clan situation, Leo.

11:21.625 --> 11:22.458
Huh?

11:22.541 --> 11:25.041
What's it gonna take
for you to be serious, Leo?

11:25.125 --> 11:28.083
And end up with a worry line
between my eyes like you?

11:28.166 --> 11:30.666
No, no, no, I do not want a Raph chasm.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.875
"Chasm"?

11:31.958 --> 11:35.083
You know, valley, gorge, crevasse.

11:35.625 --> 11:40.750
The only reason I have a chasm
is I have to worry about you bozos 24/7.

11:41.458 --> 11:44.000
You just don't get it, Leo.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.666
I'm the oldest here.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.916
I'm responsible for keeping us safe

11:48.000 --> 11:50.958
and making sure we can
handle anything that comes our way.

11:51.541 --> 11:56.083
'Cause if I don't,
you could all end up dead.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.458
Sorry, I missed that.

11:58.541 --> 12:02.208
Can you repeat everything from…
well, everything?

12:07.250 --> 12:10.625
No wonder you always want to train.
You really need the practice.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.500
Let him go, Mikey.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.958
Wait! No!

12:14.041 --> 12:17.041
Boys! Stop this arguing!

12:17.125 --> 12:18.791
But, Dad, Leo keeps--

12:18.875 --> 12:20.166
Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.416
No more.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.708
You are a team. You are brothers.

12:24.791 --> 12:28.875
And most importantly, you are too loud!

12:28.958 --> 12:30.750
I cannot hear my TV show!

12:30.833 --> 12:34.458
Tristan finally proposed to Annabelle,
but did she say yes?

12:34.541 --> 12:37.041
I don't know because of you!

12:37.625 --> 12:39.958
Be the ninjas I taught you to be,

12:40.041 --> 12:42.833
respectful and quiet!

12:47.791 --> 12:49.958
Sorry. Excuse me.

12:50.041 --> 12:52.375
Hey, how am I supposed to find this thing?

13:02.416 --> 13:03.375
Whoa.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.333
So many people.

13:09.958 --> 13:12.166
How am I gonna save them all, Sensei?

13:14.291 --> 13:15.958
I really wish you were here.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.333
Wait, you are!

13:19.375 --> 13:20.791
I just need to find you.

13:24.125 --> 13:24.958
April.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.166
She'll know.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.791
-Huh?

13:34.875 --> 13:37.125
Hi, professor. Do you have a sec?

13:37.208 --> 13:38.125
Hmm.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.416
Are you even in this class?

13:40.500 --> 13:42.625
I'm April O'Neil, journalism major.

13:42.708 --> 13:45.750
I write for the
Eastlaird University Daily News.

13:45.833 --> 13:49.125
Maybe I could get some shots of you
at the whiteboard for a story?

13:49.208 --> 13:51.083
Oh! Of course.

13:51.166 --> 13:54.458
-So, uh, what… what should I do?

13:54.541 --> 13:57.250
You know, just write something sciencey.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.291
I actually have the perfect equation
for your article.

14:00.375 --> 14:03.333
Now a few where you're
staring thoughtfully at your work.

14:03.416 --> 14:07.291
Oh, I always stare intently
at my equations.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.125
Especially this one.

14:09.958 --> 14:13.291
You know,
I think I should put on my lab coat.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.333
-Look at it!
-Oh! Okay.

14:17.916 --> 14:21.625
You know, I could probably
stare at this equation all day.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.166
This is April O'Neil, investigative
reporter, Eastlaird University Daily News.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.250
For years, this college shot down
rumors that a foreign government

14:30.333 --> 14:31.500
is paying them millions

14:31.583 --> 14:34.166
to develop a super-toxic
herbicidal deforestation bomb.

14:34.250 --> 14:38.625
Those rumors end today because
I'm about to blow the lid off Big Chem.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.916
April O'Neil.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.916
-Ooh. This stuff looks nasty.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.750
-Hey! Who's there?

14:53.833 --> 14:54.666
Hm?

15:00.458 --> 15:01.916
Evidence, baby.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.416
Oh boy.

15:10.916 --> 15:15.083
Well, it's a good thing video
ain't the only thing I took.

15:20.666 --> 15:22.375
April! Yes!

15:27.458 --> 15:29.708
-Commander O'Neil--
-Catlike reflex!

15:29.791 --> 15:32.666
What's the matter with you,
creeping up on a person in the dark?

15:37.458 --> 15:38.458
What the…

15:44.166 --> 15:46.625
And then I saw that picture
and I brought him here.

15:48.666 --> 15:49.625
Sensei?

15:51.458 --> 15:52.291
Hm?

15:53.083 --> 15:53.916
It's you!

15:54.000 --> 15:56.208
It's all of you! Together!

15:56.291 --> 16:00.833
I never thought I'd see you again!
I'm so happy I could hug you! 

16:06.625 --> 16:09.666
Who are you,
and why do you have a picture of us?

16:09.750 --> 16:12.166
Yeah, who took this? 'Cause I look great.

16:12.250 --> 16:16.541
What's your favorite pizza?
'Cause I'm ordering right now.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.083
And why are you
wearing genius-built apparel?

16:19.666 --> 16:21.791
That's trademarked!

16:24.041 --> 16:25.041
Grappling hook!

16:25.541 --> 16:26.541
What's going on?

16:30.833 --> 16:33.208
-He's trying to escape!

16:33.291 --> 16:35.708
-Want me to knock him out again?
-Let me.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.000
Donnie? Donnie!

16:37.625 --> 16:39.125
Oh, okay.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.333
Wa… Wait, stop!
I'm a friend. Let me explain.

16:44.708 --> 16:45.791
Let's start over.

16:46.625 --> 16:50.208
My name is Casey Jones,
and the reason I have this photo

16:50.291 --> 16:53.625
and your tech
is because you gave it to me,

16:53.708 --> 16:56.916
but not yet, because I'm from…

16:57.000 --> 16:58.958
the future!

17:03.500 --> 17:04.583
This isn't a joke.

17:04.666 --> 17:08.416
Please, if time travel is possible,
future Donnie would have come back

17:08.500 --> 17:12.041
and already given me
all the lottery numbers like we planned.

17:12.125 --> 17:16.250
It's true. I need you to believe me.
Humanity depends on it.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.958
In the future,
an alien race decimated the planet.

17:20.041 --> 17:24.416
We were hunted. We lived in caves.
We ate leaves and rats.

17:24.958 --> 17:25.791
No offense.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.416
None taken. We are delicious.

17:29.291 --> 17:33.666
I know how this sounds,
but Master Leonardo gave me a mission.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.125
I do like how he calls me "Master."

17:38.291 --> 17:39.458
Of course I do.

17:39.541 --> 17:42.791
You are the greatest ninja
the world has ever seen.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.916
You told me to find the key
and stop the Krang.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.833
"Aliens." Pfft.

17:47.916 --> 17:51.000
Sure.
This story just keeps getting better.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Splints?

17:53.625 --> 17:55.416
"The Krang"?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.333
I have heard that name.

17:57.833 --> 18:02.250
Powerful, barbaric creatures
worshiped by the Foot Clan.

18:02.333 --> 18:05.208
Legend says they came from the stars.

18:05.291 --> 18:08.625
Ruthless, unmerciful, with one desire,

18:08.708 --> 18:12.500
to enslave our world
like so many before us.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.291
All seemed lost,

18:15.375 --> 18:18.791
until great mystic warriors
forged a mighty weapon,

18:18.875 --> 18:24.250
a key that was used to lock them
in a prison dimension beyond this realm.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.250
Over the centuries,
the mystic key remained hidden

18:27.333 --> 18:32.041
to protect humankind
and prevent the return of the Krang.

18:32.625 --> 18:33.625
So…

18:33.708 --> 18:36.583
Future boy is really from the future?

18:37.083 --> 18:39.083
Mind…

18:39.583 --> 18:42.333
Someone finds the key! Today!

18:42.416 --> 18:46.125
They steal it and use it
to open a doorway and free the Krang!

18:46.208 --> 18:48.791
That's why I came back, to find it first.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.708
Master Leonardo drew a picture
on the back of that photo.

18:51.791 --> 18:53.375
So to stop the Krang,

18:53.458 --> 18:56.541
all we have to do
is find the key before it's stolen.

18:57.416 --> 18:58.541
-Mm.
-Hm-mm.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.000
-Huh.

19:02.708 --> 19:03.541
What?

19:05.541 --> 19:08.750
Yeah, did future handsome,
amazing me tell you what to do

19:08.833 --> 19:10.666
in case that already happened?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.958
'Cause that already happened.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.125
Mm!

19:14.875 --> 19:17.833
Oh no, we're too late!

19:23.375 --> 19:24.208
No, we're not.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.958
'Cause we know who has the key,
the Foot Clan.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.208
Okay, we gotta find them
before they use it,

19:29.291 --> 19:32.708
and this time, we do it together!

19:39.250 --> 19:41.500
Uh, can someone untie me now?

19:53.291 --> 19:58.208
Villain to villain,
your hideout is a bit… lacking.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.333
Might I suggest some velvet, a fireplace,

20:01.416 --> 20:04.041
maybe a fuzzy white cat
with a diamond necklace?

20:10.791 --> 20:15.541
Tonight, we liberate our masters
from their dimensional prison.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.958
With this key,

20:17.041 --> 20:21.916
we shall free them to lay waste
to this world and enslave its people.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.375
Ah, I thought we were just gonna rob
a bank and be, you know, crime buddies.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.583
We shall follow the Krang
as they lead the Foot Clan to glory!

20:32.666 --> 20:34.666
-Bored.

20:35.791 --> 20:36.625
You!

20:36.708 --> 20:38.250
-Leo!
-What?

20:38.333 --> 20:43.000
I was waiting for a good spot to jump in,
but they just kept blabbity-blab-ing.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.375
There it is! That's the key.

20:46.541 --> 20:51.166
Get them! Don't let them
interfere with the ceremony!

20:58.083 --> 20:58.916
No!

21:00.583 --> 21:02.166
-It started!

21:02.250 --> 21:06.125
He's unlocking the doorway!
We need to get up there right now!

21:06.208 --> 21:08.166
Casey, go. We've got you covered.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.833
Oh no.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.250
Oh.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.333
Oh no! They're here!

21:51.416 --> 21:54.375
Then let's make sure
their visit's short and sweet.

22:00.083 --> 22:03.125
I'm finally free!

22:04.041 --> 22:10.000
The people of this planet
will pay for what they've done to me.

22:10.083 --> 22:13.541
Welcome to Earth.
I hope you don't enjoy your stay!

22:31.625 --> 22:33.291
-Oh!

22:38.291 --> 22:40.041
Enough tricks!

22:50.166 --> 22:52.791
Mikey! Donnie! No!

23:06.333 --> 23:07.333
No…

23:15.625 --> 23:18.041
Raph, what happened to our powers?

23:18.750 --> 23:20.000
They… They're gone.

23:20.583 --> 23:22.416
What did they do to us?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.875
Brother, sister, join me.

23:26.958 --> 23:32.333
Time for us to finish remaking
this universe in the image of Krang.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.916
How I've waited for this day.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.458
Indeed.

23:42.041 --> 23:47.000
Brother, widen the portal
and retrieve our ship, the Technodrome.

23:47.083 --> 23:51.750
Once it is here,
this world will kneel before us.

23:52.833 --> 23:57.000
Oh, if you two don't mind,
I haven't killed anything in ages.

24:13.041 --> 24:13.916
No!

24:28.875 --> 24:29.791
Huh?

24:30.416 --> 24:31.250
No!

24:43.708 --> 24:44.791
Retreat!

24:44.875 --> 24:46.500
Retreat? We don't retreat!

24:46.583 --> 24:50.875
Leo, for once, listen to me.
They're too powerful and Dad's hurt.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.541
You don't understand.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.375
If we don't close that doorway,
it's only gonna get worse.

24:55.458 --> 24:56.458
Raph?

24:56.541 --> 25:00.041
I'm not gonna argue with you, Leo!
Donnie, escape pods, now!

25:01.458 --> 25:03.458
You don't have to tell me twice!

25:25.791 --> 25:27.791
Sensei, we need to get that key!

25:41.333 --> 25:42.416
-Leo!

26:11.458 --> 26:12.625
Huh?

26:31.166 --> 26:32.166
Raph?

26:40.958 --> 26:41.875
Raph, wait, no.

26:41.958 --> 26:45.583
Wait, Raph! Raph! No, Raph!
Raph! No, Raph!

26:51.625 --> 26:53.750
Escape pods incoming.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.916
Congratulations
on surviving, fam.

27:01.666 --> 27:03.916
-Huh?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.541
Oh, I hate that.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.958
Everyone okay? Anybody hurt?

27:08.041 --> 27:09.583
How did we get here?

27:09.666 --> 27:12.750
Donnie pods.
We've never had to use those before.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.208
So, how would everyone
rate their escape experience?

27:17.291 --> 27:20.250
"Very satisfied," "Very, very satisfied,"
"Extremely satisfied"?

27:20.333 --> 27:22.833
-Donnie!
-Sorry. Sorry.

27:22.916 --> 27:24.541
Data collection calms me down.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.083
Splints.

27:28.166 --> 27:30.666
This is terrible! Why did we leave?

27:30.750 --> 27:34.125
In case you didn't notice,
we were getting our butts kicked!

27:34.208 --> 27:36.708
-But my mission was to stop them!

27:36.791 --> 27:38.541
Now, the Krang are using that key

27:38.625 --> 27:41.708
to bring in something
that will destroy the world.

27:42.208 --> 27:43.041
We lost.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.875
Oof.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.750
-Where's my other pod?
-Where's Raph?

28:00.750 --> 28:03.666
Ah, did you know this would happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

28:03.750 --> 28:05.500
-What are you talking about?
-Easy!

28:05.583 --> 28:09.375
-Leo, what's going on? Where's Raph?
-Leo, what happened to Raph?

28:09.458 --> 28:10.583
Leonardo?

28:12.333 --> 28:13.166
They…

28:13.250 --> 28:14.583
They got him.

28:14.666 --> 28:15.916
You left Raph?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.166
He left himself.

28:17.250 --> 28:21.500
He used his pod to save me, all because
I went after this stupid thing.

28:21.583 --> 28:23.250
You got it! Nice.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.958
"Nice"? They captured Raph!

28:27.041 --> 28:29.291
He's from the future!
He knew this would happen!

28:29.375 --> 28:32.000
No, I didn't.
This didn't happen in my time.

28:32.625 --> 28:36.000
We changed the past, and you got the key.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.166
That means there's
still a chance to stop them.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.416
-No, we have to save Raph. Come on.
-Leo, wait.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.500
If you won't come, I'll go myself.

28:44.666 --> 28:48.416
-We've lost our mystic powers.
-We don't have a plan!

28:48.500 --> 28:49.833
We don't need a plan.

28:49.916 --> 28:52.916
"I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen," his words.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.291
Shouldn't we talk about this

28:54.375 --> 28:57.125
before we run off all half-cocked,
willy-nilly, pell-mell?

28:57.208 --> 29:00.250
I keep being told
I'm doing this hero thing wrong.

29:00.333 --> 29:02.166
But I got the key, didn't I?

29:02.250 --> 29:05.541
I get results,
so now we're doing it my way.

29:05.625 --> 29:08.958
My son, listen to your team.

29:09.041 --> 29:10.625
This is not about you.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.458
They made it about me
when they took my brother.

29:15.916 --> 29:17.625
Trust me, I got this.

29:19.333 --> 29:20.708
Donnie, you're driving.

29:25.875 --> 29:27.291
What do we do with this?

29:27.375 --> 29:31.291
We can't just bring it with us,
but we can't just leave it behind.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.625
Then we should destroy it.

29:33.708 --> 29:36.166
Splints and I will stay here
and take care of business.

29:38.958 --> 29:39.875
Mm-hmm.

29:43.708 --> 29:45.291
Thanks, Commander O'Neil.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.125
"Commander"? I like the sound of that.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.708
Oh, look at it.

30:07.041 --> 30:09.000
-Disgusting.

30:09.083 --> 30:11.291
-Try looking in a mirror.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.208
Ugh, it's talking at me.

30:14.166 --> 30:16.083
I'm going to rip out its tongue.

30:16.708 --> 30:18.041
Forgive my sister.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.791
She's got a bit of a temper.

30:23.750 --> 30:27.708
And being in prison for a thousand years
hasn't done her any favors.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.875
You're not human.

30:31.750 --> 30:33.125
What are you?

30:33.208 --> 30:34.541
Let me go, and I'll show you.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.500
-Hmm.

30:37.083 --> 30:40.166
You're more powerful
than the people of this planet,

30:40.250 --> 30:42.291
yet you defend them.

30:42.916 --> 30:45.541
-Why?
-It's my duty.

30:47.583 --> 30:50.500
A word used by the weak.

30:50.583 --> 30:54.041
Many planets before yours
have spoken of duty.

30:54.125 --> 30:57.416
They too have been consumed by the Krang.

30:57.500 --> 31:02.250
And now our glorious crusade continues

31:02.333 --> 31:06.041
to restore the natural order of things.

31:06.541 --> 31:11.250
The strong will devour the weak.

31:11.333 --> 31:12.333
Last I checked,

31:12.416 --> 31:15.750
we weren't the ones locked in a
prison dimension for a thousand years.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.458
That's called "trash talk."

31:17.541 --> 31:19.125
A rare misstep.

31:19.208 --> 31:22.166
Once I retrieve the key
from your comrades,

31:22.250 --> 31:24.916
I will bring forth the mighty Technodrome,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.875
and you will witness
the true power of the Krang.

31:28.958 --> 31:34.541
Now, where have they taken my key?

31:35.250 --> 31:37.458
It won't tell you anything.

31:37.541 --> 31:39.500
Let me kill it.

31:39.583 --> 31:43.041
Lady brain face here is right.
I'm not telling you jack.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.125
You don't have to tell me.

31:47.666 --> 31:49.500
I'll look myself.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.000
There it is.

32:03.708 --> 32:05.541
They always do it the hard way.

32:08.750 --> 32:13.583
Our brother and I will secure
a location for the dimensional doorway.

32:13.666 --> 32:16.833
Take these soldiers
and retrieve me my key.

32:16.916 --> 32:18.541
We live to serve.

32:19.041 --> 32:23.250
You will serve me whether you live or not.

32:54.416 --> 32:56.083
What is this thing?

32:56.166 --> 32:59.083
Hold on
to your gluteus maximi!

33:00.125 --> 33:03.750
The Turtle Tank, baby!
It's how we roll in the past.

33:03.833 --> 33:06.208
I mean, the present. I mean…

33:06.291 --> 33:09.791
-Ugh! Time travel's confusing.
-They're on the move.

33:09.875 --> 33:12.583
According to the subcutaneous tracker
I put on Raph--

33:12.666 --> 33:15.291
Wait, does that mean
you put trackers on all of us?

33:16.416 --> 33:17.833
"No"?

33:18.333 --> 33:23.000
No, of course I did… n't.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.000
Based on their trajectory, they're headed…

33:25.083 --> 33:27.208
…to the tallest building in the city.

33:27.291 --> 33:29.583
That's right, Metro Tower.

33:29.666 --> 33:32.958
I heard the story so many times as a kid,
but I never thought…

33:33.458 --> 33:34.500
"And behold,

33:34.583 --> 33:38.958
from their perch atop New York City,
the Krang ripped open the sky itself."

33:39.666 --> 33:41.208
"What came out was terror,

33:41.291 --> 33:44.750
and what rained down upon us
was worse than death."

33:47.750 --> 33:49.458
They told that to kids?

33:49.958 --> 33:51.625
Man, the future is harsh.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.125
I'm not gonna let that happen.

33:54.208 --> 33:56.708
We need to get into Metro Tower
without being spotted.

33:56.791 --> 33:58.208
We'll take the subway tunnels.

33:58.291 --> 34:01.791
Subway tunnels don't offer much
in the way of an escape if we need it.

34:01.875 --> 34:04.875
-Are you sure about this?
-Yeah, maybe we should--

34:04.958 --> 34:07.541
Guys, we're doing it my way. Remember?

34:15.666 --> 34:16.583
Hm?

34:26.500 --> 34:31.291
Prepare the site so we may
bring forth the Technodrome.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.000
Yes, brother.

34:50.791 --> 34:53.750
See? Smooth sailing.
We'll have Raph in no time.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.083
I hope he's okay.

34:55.583 --> 34:58.125
How are we gonna find him
once we get there?

34:58.208 --> 35:01.083
I have a lot of questions
regarding "once we get there."

35:01.166 --> 35:05.750
Relax. We'll do what we always do.
Ninja in, ninja their faces, ninja out.

35:05.833 --> 35:09.166
That's exactly how you freed all those
families from the Krang labor camp.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.666
Yeah, that sounds like me.

35:10.750 --> 35:13.791
In the future,
you guys are beyond amazing.

35:13.875 --> 35:17.291
The mystic powers you're able
to harness are on a whole other level.

35:17.375 --> 35:19.291
Of course! What about my future?

35:19.375 --> 35:21.583
I'm expecting big things for me.

35:21.666 --> 35:24.750
How many Nobel prizes do I have?
Don't tell me. I wanna be surprised.

35:24.833 --> 35:29.833
Donnie, you were the most brilliant,
innovative mind of all time.

35:29.916 --> 35:33.500
I'm shocked, I am.
Go on, continue to meet my expectations.

35:33.583 --> 35:35.000
What do I do in the future?

35:35.083 --> 35:39.333
You are the most powerful mystic warrior
the world has ever known.

35:39.916 --> 35:43.000
With those two hands,
you sent me back in time.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.666
Wow!

35:55.500 --> 35:58.958
Actually,
there is something I should tell you.

36:02.416 --> 36:04.458
Auto brake engaged.

36:04.541 --> 36:05.500
Huh.

36:06.000 --> 36:06.833
Wow.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.750
Think we're in the right place?

36:09.250 --> 36:13.250
Looks like the Metro Tower station
is on the other side of those vines.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.791
Great. Let's hoof it.

36:15.375 --> 36:18.416
Through the disgusting,
drippy slime jungle?

36:21.708 --> 36:24.125
I know. I know. Leo knows best,

36:24.208 --> 36:26.166
but I'm not sharing my hand sanitizer.

36:34.750 --> 36:38.166
Feeling a lack of rush
in this rush hour, right?

36:38.833 --> 36:42.375
I don't know, Leo.
Something feels…

36:43.875 --> 36:44.791
off.

36:45.541 --> 36:49.833
Don't worry. I won't let us die.
I'm a mystic warrior.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.916
"I feel better already,"
he said without a hint of sarcasm.

36:55.208 --> 36:56.750
Look, the stairs.

36:56.833 --> 37:01.791
Sneaking in from below was the right move.
Those slimeballs will never see us coming.

37:09.375 --> 37:13.125
We tried to jackhammer it,
flamethrower it, pour acid on it…

37:14.041 --> 37:17.500
I thought lasers cut everything!
How did that not work?

37:18.333 --> 37:19.916
There's not even a scratch!

37:20.000 --> 37:23.125
Maybe it was your aim.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.875
Maybe your big rat head got in the way!

37:28.458 --> 37:30.458
Mmm, I'll show you, fat rat head.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.583
Okay, deep breaths.

37:32.666 --> 37:34.750
You said some things, I said some things.

37:34.833 --> 37:37.250
Maybe we should just
get back to saving the world.

37:38.541 --> 37:39.541
What's next?

37:39.625 --> 37:41.541
-Huh?

37:42.958 --> 37:44.875
This cannot be good.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.500
April O'Neil!

37:55.541 --> 37:57.041
Come back here!

37:57.125 --> 37:58.875
-Faster.

38:00.208 --> 38:01.583
Faster!

38:02.083 --> 38:04.000
I knew this was a bad idea.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.750
Leo, there's too many. We should go back.

38:06.833 --> 38:09.125
No, we're gonna get to those stairs.

38:09.208 --> 38:12.166
Leo, we're not gonna make it!
We have to turn back.

38:12.250 --> 38:16.291
We push forward, get Raph, that's final.

38:25.125 --> 38:28.208
Mystic hands!

38:36.166 --> 38:37.708
Donnie! Mikey!

38:38.916 --> 38:42.875
Oh no, Donnie, your soft shell!
You're exposed!

38:44.416 --> 38:45.875
We gotta find shelter!

38:49.375 --> 38:51.416
Oh, oh, keep it down, Vomitello!

38:51.500 --> 38:53.958
Oh. Keep it down, daddy!

39:00.666 --> 39:04.125
Run, insects, but you can't escape!

39:08.166 --> 39:09.166
Don't!

39:10.333 --> 39:13.250
The key, human! Give it to me!

39:13.333 --> 39:14.500
Ah!

39:31.583 --> 39:36.333
What did you do to me?
What did you do to my face?

39:36.416 --> 39:37.958
-Ha!

39:38.041 --> 39:40.708
I knew that stuff was nasty! I told y'all!

39:40.791 --> 39:43.166
Yes, yes, you're a genius. Let's go.

40:11.416 --> 40:12.250
Ah!

40:16.916 --> 40:18.166
Donnie, come in.

40:18.250 --> 40:21.291
They found us. Where should we go? Donnie?

40:21.375 --> 40:22.750
We're trapped.

40:22.833 --> 40:25.250
We are trapped
in the subway under Metro Tower.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.083
The tank is running on emergency power

40:27.166 --> 40:30.250
and is covered
in some kind of Krang bio-growth.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.416
-I repeat--
-April, come quick!

40:32.500 --> 40:34.458
We're getting squished!

40:34.541 --> 40:35.958
We're on our way!

40:36.041 --> 40:38.666
But, April, how will we get them out?

40:39.166 --> 40:40.708
I've got an idea.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.500
Yeesh.
Remind me to never get on your bad side.

40:53.791 --> 40:55.500
Casey!

40:56.375 --> 40:57.458
Casey, you okay?

41:02.250 --> 41:04.625
Donnie, Mikey, anybody?

41:04.708 --> 41:06.875
Ah!

41:10.833 --> 41:12.416
What the heck was that?

41:13.166 --> 41:16.250
Some kind of drippy, crazy Krang monster.

41:16.333 --> 41:19.000
No, I mean you!
Why weren't you listening to anybody?

41:19.083 --> 41:22.333
Because I was trying to get us
into the building!

41:22.416 --> 41:23.958
That sure worked out well.

41:24.041 --> 41:27.041
I was doing everything right.
How could it go wrong?

41:27.125 --> 41:29.083
Because you weren't
listening to your team!

41:29.166 --> 41:31.833
You don't have
all the answers all the time!

41:31.916 --> 41:35.125
I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen. You said that.

41:35.208 --> 41:37.125
I was wrong.

41:37.708 --> 41:38.541
What?

41:38.625 --> 41:40.833
You're impulsive, you're arrogant,

41:40.916 --> 41:45.416
and you don't see that every decision
you make could cost someone their life.

41:45.916 --> 41:48.958
You want to know what really happens
to your brothers in the future?

41:50.125 --> 41:53.166
They die.
Everybody dies fighting the Krang.

41:54.041 --> 41:56.583
The world needs Master Leonardo.

41:57.166 --> 41:59.250
And all we got is this guy.

42:11.625 --> 42:15.500
We have an update
on the strange situation at Metro Tower.

42:15.583 --> 42:18.833
All contact has been lost
with those inside the building,

42:18.916 --> 42:20.541
and conflicting reports suggest

42:20.625 --> 42:24.125
something is barricading entrance
for emergency personnel.

42:36.208 --> 42:37.416
Fools.

42:37.500 --> 42:41.250
These creatures should
welcome the power of the Krang.

42:41.333 --> 42:45.041
You on the rooftop!
Stop and surrender immediately!

42:45.125 --> 42:48.541
We've got eyes on the roof top
where the police are confronting--

42:48.625 --> 42:49.708
What is that?

42:49.791 --> 42:52.541
You may begin.

43:07.791 --> 43:08.708
Look out!

43:25.708 --> 43:27.625
Mmm.

43:42.375 --> 43:43.958
-Look,

43:44.583 --> 43:47.875
I know I'm not the Leo you knew
in the future, and maybe I never will be.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.625
This whole time
I was sure my family needed me,

43:50.708 --> 43:52.916
but the truth is I need them.

43:53.416 --> 43:56.625
If we're gonna survive this,
we have to do it together.

44:09.166 --> 44:14.833
Hull integrity, 4%.
Breach imminent. Good luck.

44:15.416 --> 44:18.416
Whew, good.
We have an imminent amount of time.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.833
"Imminent" means "soon," Mikey.

44:23.708 --> 44:27.208
Don't worry.
I'll save us with my mystic hands.

44:34.166 --> 44:35.000
Ah?

44:36.125 --> 44:38.291
Casey must have been wrong about me.

44:41.208 --> 44:42.750
This is it, Donnie.

44:42.833 --> 44:44.708
We're gonna get crushed!

44:45.750 --> 44:47.416
-Knock-knock!
-April?

44:48.541 --> 44:50.791
Anyone order a rescue?

44:58.666 --> 45:00.666
Boom goes the herbicide!

45:09.166 --> 45:10.291
April!

45:11.125 --> 45:12.291
You saved us!

45:12.375 --> 45:14.416
Uncomfortable with emotion!

45:14.500 --> 45:17.250
Where is Leo? And, uh, Future Boy?

45:17.333 --> 45:19.333
Somewhere in there.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.750
Faster! They're this way.

45:22.833 --> 45:25.250
I can smell them.

45:25.333 --> 45:28.333
-She found us! We gotta move now.

45:30.791 --> 45:33.708
Oh man,
is this what the future looks like?

45:33.791 --> 45:36.958
Nope, the future is worse. Much worse.

45:37.541 --> 45:39.333
Donnie, Mikey, do you read me?

45:39.416 --> 45:40.916
Come in, Leo.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.416
Donnie, where are you?

45:42.500 --> 45:45.416
We've extracted from the subway
and are ascending a staircase.

45:45.500 --> 45:48.166
I'm getting a lot of interference,
but if you hold still,

45:48.250 --> 45:51.500
I can triangulate your position
using a complex geo-location algorithm.

45:51.583 --> 45:54.916
-Uh, Donnie?
-Odd numbers, primes, no… almost.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.958
-Almost!

45:57.833 --> 46:00.666
Ugh. I never get to use my algorithm.

46:00.750 --> 46:03.958
Man, I am so glad you guys aren't dead.

46:04.041 --> 46:04.875
Ditto.

46:06.208 --> 46:09.541
Okay, before this gets too mushy,
we need to locate Raph.

46:09.625 --> 46:11.583
Can you tell me if he's in the building?

46:11.666 --> 46:14.208
Bet your momma's
subatomic particles I can.

46:14.708 --> 46:17.000
Got him! He's close.

46:17.083 --> 46:18.750
He's almost on top of us.

46:18.833 --> 46:20.791
Wait, he is on top of us.

46:24.166 --> 46:25.166
Raph!

46:25.250 --> 46:27.750
Quick, cut him down, get him out of there.

46:34.750 --> 46:35.583
Huh?

46:38.833 --> 46:41.166
Hang on. We got you. Almost there.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.333
Raph?

46:48.000 --> 46:48.833
Ah.

47:23.958 --> 47:25.416
Surprise.

47:26.125 --> 47:27.958
What did you do to my brother?

47:28.041 --> 47:29.458
Improved him.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.833
Thank you for this.
We will be putting it to good use.

47:53.916 --> 47:57.625
Come, the world awaits destruction.

47:59.708 --> 48:01.166
Tear them apart!

48:11.791 --> 48:13.041
We gotta move.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.458
-Leo, move!
-No!

48:30.958 --> 48:34.416
A shame our brethren
didn't survive the prison dimension.

48:34.500 --> 48:40.500
Then again, their weakness
has no place in my new Krang empire.

48:46.416 --> 48:50.250
Open and bring unto this world

48:50.333 --> 48:53.500
the mighty power of Krang!

49:37.291 --> 49:38.958
Warning! This is a warning!

49:39.041 --> 49:41.375
…appears to be something
falling from the sky--

49:42.458 --> 49:43.333
What?

49:44.166 --> 49:45.041
Oh!

50:21.958 --> 50:22.833
Begin!

51:09.500 --> 51:10.833
What do we do now?

51:10.916 --> 51:15.750
I fear we are lost.
The Krang are too powerful.

51:18.500 --> 51:21.250
Maybe we could
change the future some other way.

51:21.333 --> 51:25.791
Guys, it's time to face facts.
We can't change the future.

51:26.375 --> 51:27.333
Says who?

51:27.833 --> 51:31.083
Says the grandfather paradox,
says physical determinism,

51:31.166 --> 51:33.458
says the space-time continuum.

51:34.041 --> 51:36.375
Look, I didn't want it to be true, but…

51:37.125 --> 51:39.083
…science.

51:39.166 --> 51:42.125
That's it! Donnie's wrong.

51:42.208 --> 51:45.250
The world is ending,
yet the barbs continue.

51:45.333 --> 51:48.625
Don't you remember?
We already did change the future.

51:48.708 --> 51:51.958
Raph never got kidnapped and
turned into a Krang zombie in your time.

51:52.041 --> 51:54.375
-Right, Casey?
-No, he didn't.

51:55.166 --> 51:59.333
That means we did change the future!
We're just in a different…

51:59.416 --> 52:01.375
Bifurcated time branch?

52:01.458 --> 52:03.458
Yes, yes, yes, that nerd thing.

52:03.541 --> 52:06.833
You know what that means, right?
We still have hope!

52:06.916 --> 52:09.375
A ninja's greatest weapon.

52:09.958 --> 52:11.250
Hey, I like that!

52:11.750 --> 52:15.125
Look, I'm done
thinking I have all the answers.

52:15.208 --> 52:16.833
I don't know how to beat the Krang,

52:16.916 --> 52:22.166
but I do know our future
isn't written until we write it as a team.

52:22.250 --> 52:23.333
So what do we got?

52:25.458 --> 52:26.291
Maybe…

52:27.000 --> 52:29.291
Maybe we don't have to beat them.

52:29.375 --> 52:31.791
Can't we just send them
back to the prison dimension?

52:31.875 --> 52:35.875
There's an idea! Donnie, what do those
big, beautiful eyebrows have to say?

52:35.958 --> 52:40.458
If we got control of their ship,
we could send it back through the portal.

52:40.541 --> 52:43.125
Yes! Yes! Now we're cooking. Who else?

52:43.708 --> 52:45.791
If someone on the ground
can get to that key…

52:45.875 --> 52:47.750
We can close the doorway.

52:47.833 --> 52:51.333
And then bye-bye Krang forever, baby!

52:52.166 --> 52:56.833
Exactly. What do you say, Donnie?
You ready to fly a space ship?

52:57.416 --> 53:00.541
Literally the greatest question
I have ever been asked.

53:00.625 --> 53:04.166
All right, team, we have a plan.
Let's go save the world.

53:05.083 --> 53:07.583
Wait, but what about Raph?

53:12.791 --> 53:15.833
That big jerk may be
covered in goo and half alien,

53:15.916 --> 53:19.250
but he's still our brother,
and I'm not giving up on him.

53:19.333 --> 53:20.958
I'm not leaving him behind.

53:52.375 --> 53:54.083
There's the key. Let's go.

54:04.875 --> 54:06.791
Like Casey said, let's go!

54:12.375 --> 54:14.250
I wish my tech was working!

54:14.333 --> 54:16.708
Usually, my cardio is jetpack-assisted.

54:16.791 --> 54:19.166
I'm not getting credit
for any of these steps!

54:28.958 --> 54:30.291
Eugh.

54:30.375 --> 54:33.375
Hey, question,
is it too late to join April's team?

54:33.458 --> 54:34.291
Sh.

54:35.958 --> 54:38.625
You two figure out
how to hijack this ship.

54:38.708 --> 54:40.166
I'm gonna find Raph.

54:44.500 --> 54:46.208
So how do we hack this thing?

54:48.666 --> 54:50.333
Best guess, main console?

54:51.375 --> 54:53.375
Unfortunately, it's ocupado.

55:06.458 --> 55:08.166
Uh, new plan.

55:08.250 --> 55:09.458
Run!

55:29.125 --> 55:31.750
Surprise. I've come for my brother.

55:34.208 --> 55:35.916
Let me guess.

55:36.708 --> 55:37.708
Duty.

55:37.791 --> 55:40.291
He said doodie.

55:52.791 --> 55:54.583
I see you got yourself an upgrade.

55:55.916 --> 55:58.291
You'll pay for what you have done to me!

56:01.750 --> 56:05.958
This psycho routine is a little thin.
Where's the character development?

56:11.625 --> 56:14.125
Leo's counting on us
to get to that key.

56:14.208 --> 56:15.666
I think I have an idea.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.083
Cover me!

56:25.000 --> 56:27.916
Raph, you're coming with me,
whether you like it or not.

56:30.083 --> 56:33.041
I don't want to fight you,
but I will if I have to.

56:35.333 --> 56:38.000
Oh, you will have to.

57:02.208 --> 57:03.708
Bravo, Mikey!

57:04.458 --> 57:07.250
There's no buttons,
or computers, or anything.

57:07.333 --> 57:10.333
Just a lot of drippy,
ooey-gooey disgustingness.

57:10.416 --> 57:12.083
I don't know how to hack in…

57:13.625 --> 57:15.625
Oh God, I know what I have to do.

57:15.708 --> 57:16.541
What?

57:18.791 --> 57:20.708
No, I don't think I can do this.

57:20.791 --> 57:22.916
-What are you talking about?

57:23.000 --> 57:23.833
Oh no!

57:23.916 --> 57:26.833
That's… …so gross!

57:26.916 --> 57:28.625
-I can't do it.
-I believe in you!

57:28.708 --> 57:31.166
-No, it's my worst nightmare.
-I know.

57:31.250 --> 57:34.000
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

57:40.708 --> 57:44.666
Raph, I know you're in there somewhere.
You've gotta snap out of this!

57:45.750 --> 57:48.708
Do you feel what
the power of the Krang can do?

57:48.791 --> 57:53.000
I am saving this weak planet!

57:53.083 --> 57:55.666
I am a gift!

58:13.833 --> 58:16.833
It's not working.
I need more of a connection.

58:17.416 --> 58:19.333
Mikey, take off my battle shell.

58:19.416 --> 58:22.333
No, you're too vulnerable
with just your soft shell.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.250
There's no time, hurry.

58:44.375 --> 58:46.125
Donnie?

58:56.791 --> 59:00.416
Mikey, I am…

59:01.208 --> 59:03.000
a spaceship!

59:03.583 --> 59:05.208
Oh! Ah!

59:09.208 --> 59:11.208
I'm trying to save you, you idiot!

59:11.291 --> 59:13.625
Why do you have to make things so hard?

59:21.708 --> 59:22.583
Ah.

59:24.833 --> 59:28.500
You want to keep coming at me?
Go ahead. I'm done fighting you.

59:33.583 --> 59:34.583
What?

59:40.666 --> 59:41.541
No!

59:50.791 --> 59:54.208
Finally, man and machine

59:54.291 --> 59:58.833
entwixed in perfect bionic synergy!

1:00:04.208 --> 1:00:08.500
How dare you desecrate Krang's ship!

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:29.916
Donnie, Mikey!

1:00:38.125 --> 1:00:39.916
I don't want to fight anymore.

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.666
I was fighting you
because I didn't understand you,

1:00:44.750 --> 1:00:45.750
but now I get it.

1:00:50.791 --> 1:00:54.166
I always figured you were mad because
you didn't like the way I did things.

1:01:02.416 --> 1:01:04.833
But when I see what's happening to you,

1:01:04.916 --> 1:01:06.625
and what's happening to them…

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:09.583
I realized it wasn't about me.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:13.916
You didn't yell because you were mad,
you yelled because you were scared.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.250
It's scary to be responsible
for the lives you protect.

1:01:17.333 --> 1:01:20.916
Your team… your family,

1:01:21.666 --> 1:01:25.375
but we do it anyway
because that's what it means to be a hero.

1:01:27.625 --> 1:01:31.041
If this is it,
I want you to know I finally understand.

1:01:32.625 --> 1:01:33.958
And I'm sorry.

1:01:51.125 --> 1:01:54.791
Raph, Raph, there you are! Come back!
Your family needs you.

1:01:57.250 --> 1:01:58.500
-Leo?
-Yes!

1:02:14.375 --> 1:02:16.875
Mikey, Donnie, we can fight this.

1:02:16.958 --> 1:02:19.875
Raph's doing it for us,
so we do it for him.

1:02:20.791 --> 1:02:22.916
That alien jerkface thinks we're weak

1:02:24.458 --> 1:02:26.583
because he hasn't seen what we can do…

1:02:28.041 --> 1:02:30.583
when we fight together!

1:02:35.625 --> 1:02:37.750
It's pointless to resist Krang.

1:02:38.333 --> 1:02:39.333
Give up!

1:02:39.416 --> 1:02:43.833
You will be consumed like
everyone else on this pathetic planet!

1:02:43.916 --> 1:02:45.833
-Fat chance.

1:02:45.916 --> 1:02:48.458
We're not like
everyone else on this planet.

1:02:49.041 --> 1:02:49.958
We are…

1:02:50.041 --> 1:02:51.708
…the Teenage…

1:02:51.791 --> 1:02:53.625
-…Mutant…
-…Ninja…

1:02:54.625 --> 1:02:55.625
…Turtles!

1:03:32.291 --> 1:03:35.333
If this isn't the poster shot,
someone's getting fired.

1:03:35.416 --> 1:03:38.166
-Oh, we are not done yet.

1:03:41.291 --> 1:03:45.291
April O'Neil!

1:03:46.541 --> 1:03:48.166
That's payback.

1:03:48.250 --> 1:03:51.250
Keep her under that building
until I bring it down.

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:06.875
Yeah!

1:04:14.208 --> 1:04:16.333
Casey, get out of there!

1:04:38.125 --> 1:04:39.541
Commander O'Neil!

1:04:39.625 --> 1:04:40.833
Nice shot.

1:04:43.708 --> 1:04:47.500
Donnie's almost got the ship to
the other side. I have to get to the key.

1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:50.541
See ya.

1:04:53.041 --> 1:04:55.916
Come in, Sensei, it's Casey.
Can you hear me?

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.208
Come in, Sensei! Can you hear me?

1:05:07.708 --> 1:05:08.541
Ya!

1:05:13.250 --> 1:05:14.125
Ah!

1:05:30.875 --> 1:05:32.166
Okay! Donnie!

1:05:33.458 --> 1:05:34.791
Cowabunga!

1:05:37.375 --> 1:05:39.041
Flip-o-rama!

1:05:40.458 --> 1:05:41.708
Let's roll.

1:05:51.125 --> 1:05:53.500
Ka-zoom!

1:06:14.083 --> 1:06:15.166
Raph, go.

1:06:15.833 --> 1:06:16.750
On it!

1:06:26.250 --> 1:06:28.583
Gotcha! Don't worry, Donnie!

1:06:28.666 --> 1:06:32.000
This is not a hug. It's a rescue!

1:06:38.333 --> 1:06:40.625
Where are we? Staten Island?

1:06:40.708 --> 1:06:42.666
Oh, gross.

1:06:42.750 --> 1:06:46.458
So how would everyone rate
that rescue experience? Unsatisfied?

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:49.875
Very unsatisfied?
Wish Donnie would have done it? Um-hum?

1:06:49.958 --> 1:06:51.666
-Donnie.

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.250
Leo's still up there.

1:07:16.458 --> 1:07:18.125
Casey. Casey, come in.

1:07:20.958 --> 1:07:24.750
Sensei, I'm here.
And I've got eyes on the key.

1:07:27.041 --> 1:07:29.625
Tell me when you're home free,
and I'll pull the plug.

1:07:37.791 --> 1:07:39.041
Casey, listen to me.

1:07:39.125 --> 1:07:41.458
When I get to the other side,
you close that door.

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:44.625
What? Sensei, no!

1:07:46.125 --> 1:07:49.041
Casey, it's the only way.
He's too strong.

1:07:49.625 --> 1:07:52.708
He's not gonna stay on the other side
unless I keep him there.

1:07:53.291 --> 1:07:55.250
There has to be another way!

1:07:55.333 --> 1:07:58.250
We tried everything, Case.
This is the only way.

1:07:59.625 --> 1:08:02.125
Leo, please don't do this! Leo!

1:08:04.250 --> 1:08:08.041
You're one to talk, big bro.
Hero moves are totally your style.

1:08:11.666 --> 1:08:15.958
Outmatched and alone, yet you persist.

1:08:16.041 --> 1:08:16.916
For what?

1:08:17.500 --> 1:08:19.875
Honor, redemption?

1:08:20.458 --> 1:08:24.500
Sacrifice? All meaningless.

1:08:25.375 --> 1:08:27.083
We'll see about that.

1:08:47.083 --> 1:08:50.250
Leo, please!
I can't lose you again.

1:08:50.833 --> 1:08:55.041
Hey, future me would be real
proud of you. I'm proud of you.

1:08:55.125 --> 1:08:58.166
Weak words, weak actions.

1:08:58.250 --> 1:09:02.833
I have forever known
what you fail to understand,

1:09:02.916 --> 1:09:06.500
strength always prevails!

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:11.250
What you fail to understand
is I missed on purpose.

1:09:15.333 --> 1:09:18.750
No, enough of your little tricks.

1:09:21.083 --> 1:09:23.000
Casey, close the portal now.

1:09:23.083 --> 1:09:24.375
What?

1:09:34.416 --> 1:09:37.000
No! Let go of me!

1:09:37.083 --> 1:09:38.833
Casey, please.

1:10:15.208 --> 1:10:17.208
You've been portal chopped.

1:10:36.375 --> 1:10:37.375
You…

1:10:42.875 --> 1:10:45.500
You've ruined everything!

1:10:45.583 --> 1:10:51.666
And now… …my wrath
will be reserved for you alone.

1:10:51.750 --> 1:10:57.791
You think you've won,
you wretched little pest?

1:11:16.708 --> 1:11:19.458
Wipe that grin off your face!

1:12:30.666 --> 1:12:33.083
Mikey, it's over.

1:12:33.791 --> 1:12:36.250
Leo never gave up on us.

1:12:36.333 --> 1:12:39.250
I'm not giving up on him.

1:12:44.833 --> 1:12:49.791
Whoa. Mikey,
whatever you're doing, don't stop!

1:12:57.958 --> 1:13:00.666
We're here, Mikey. Together.

1:13:21.041 --> 1:13:23.291
Took you guys long enough.

1:13:32.458 --> 1:13:33.291
Leo!

1:14:06.458 --> 1:14:08.333
Huh?

1:14:08.416 --> 1:14:10.208
-Leo?
-Hey.

1:14:11.291 --> 1:14:15.083
Eww! Are we in Staten Island?

1:14:15.166 --> 1:14:17.000
-Come here!
-Aww!

1:14:28.083 --> 1:14:30.083
No pictures.

1:14:46.541 --> 1:14:49.666
So this is "grabbing a slice"?

1:14:49.750 --> 1:14:50.791
I don't get it.

1:14:50.875 --> 1:14:52.458
Wait for it.

1:14:54.666 --> 1:14:56.000
Mmm.

1:14:56.500 --> 1:14:58.333
So much better than rats!

1:14:58.416 --> 1:14:59.416
-Mm-hmm.
-Hey.

1:14:59.958 --> 1:15:03.791
Hey, the rest of the world we saved
is pretty great too.

1:15:03.875 --> 1:15:06.291
All right, everybody, look up here.

1:15:13.875 --> 1:15:17.250
April, you just got a message
from someone named "Cassandra."

1:15:19.125 --> 1:15:20.333
Whoa!

1:15:21.250 --> 1:15:24.166
Looks like our friend Cassandra
has been busy.

1:15:24.750 --> 1:15:25.916
That's my mom!

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.166
There goes the space-time continuum.

1:15:28.250 --> 1:15:30.750
-You did it, little brother.

1:15:31.416 --> 1:15:32.708
You really did it.

1:15:33.416 --> 1:15:34.416
I'm proud of you.

1:15:35.708 --> 1:15:37.166
This wasn't about me.

1:15:37.250 --> 1:15:40.791
It was about all of us
doing what needed to be done

1:15:40.875 --> 1:15:42.125
because we're heroes.

1:15:42.208 --> 1:15:45.500
You said "heroes."

1:15:51.541 --> 1:15:54.416
There it is, gentlemen, our home.

1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:55.916
What a town.

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.041
Beautiful.

1:15:57.666 --> 1:16:01.750
And if it needs defending,
we'll always rise to the challenge.

1:16:02.375 --> 1:16:06.166
Speaking of which,
you know what challenge I'm gonna rise to?

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:08.458
-Beating that record!
-Yay!

1:16:08.541 --> 1:16:11.000
No way! No, okay, fine.

1:16:12.166 --> 1:16:14.625
All right, Big Raphie, let's do it!

1:16:14.708 --> 1:16:20.208
Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph!
Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph!
