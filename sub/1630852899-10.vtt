WEBVTT

00:11.489 --> 00:12.708
Is anybody out there?

00:12.838 --> 00:14.753
- All I got was some static.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.494
But it worked.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.366
I think if we get it up
over the tree line

00:18.496 --> 00:21.760
and we get it enough power, I
think we could get a signal out.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.676
- You went through a farway tree!
- Huh?

00:24.807 --> 00:26.939
Victor said you can go
all sorts of places,

00:27.070 --> 00:28.724
so maybe he went
somewhere else.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.334
We have to find him!

00:30.465 --> 00:31.727
One step at a time.
Hey, Julie.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.468
What's happening?

00:33.598 --> 00:35.078
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

00:35.209 --> 00:38.429
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.865
Has anyone seen Victor?

00:39.996 --> 00:41.824
We have a legitimate chance here
to go home.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.869
You know what? Just go.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.742
I'll stay here,
and I'll figure this out myself.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.874
I know you've had
a hard time lately

00:49.005 --> 00:52.008
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody,

00:52.139 --> 00:53.879
but I just need you
to promise me, okay?

00:54.010 --> 00:57.448
If it falls apart,
if you fall apart,

00:57.579 --> 01:00.712
you'll talk to me,
you'll let me help.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.325
It's okay.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.283
This radio
might actually work.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.329
What's it gonna be like for us?

01:11.201 --> 01:14.074
This is the only place
we've ever known together.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.340
There's no power source.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.559
You need electric?

01:22.995 --> 01:23.648
Yeah.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.699
The problem is you can't
plug anything in.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.744
God knows, whatever's coming up
through those wires is still...

01:35.007 --> 01:37.227
Holy shit.
I know how to do it.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.535
What is it?

01:43.146 --> 01:44.756
I think I hit the bottom.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.584
- I can hear them! I can--

01:46.715 --> 01:47.803
- No, no.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.544
Talk to me.
Talk-- talk to me.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.894
It was different this time.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.766
It was a woman.
She said...

01:54.897 --> 01:56.377
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

01:56.507 --> 01:59.119
"that I was wrong.

01:59.249 --> 02:03.471
There are things out here that
are worse than the monsters."

02:03.601 --> 02:05.516
We shouldn't have come here.

02:05.647 --> 02:09.607
Shh!
We're okay. We're okay.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.609
I don't think we are.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.760
"Let's go to the tower."

02:31.890 --> 02:34.545
"Behold, the tower."

02:38.767 --> 02:41.422
Hey, I know those guys.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.077
You want me to tell you a story?

02:45.208 --> 02:48.037
It's okay.
I can tell my own stories now.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.909
Well, look at you.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.824
You're all grown up now, huh?

02:54.130 --> 02:56.001
What's your story about?

02:56.132 --> 02:59.701
They're trying to find
their way back home.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.616
- Hello?

03:01.746 --> 03:03.400
I'm coming!
Calm down!

03:03.531 --> 03:05.402
- Hello?

03:05.533 --> 03:06.838
- What the hell?!
- Ha! I got it!

03:06.969 --> 03:08.100
You got what?

03:08.231 --> 03:10.015
Power problem.
I figured it out.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.408
What?

03:11.539 --> 03:12.975
- Where is...
- It's okay.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.803
...your least favorite lamp?
This one. This is ugly.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.761
- My what?
- Let's use this. Good morning!

03:16.892 --> 03:17.980
I didn't wake you, did I?

03:18.110 --> 03:19.764
What's going on?

03:19.895 --> 03:21.157
No, no, no. Wait.
What are--

03:21.288 --> 03:23.028
what are you doing?
This is not--

03:23.159 --> 03:25.640
What is the biggest problem we
have with powering the signal?

03:25.770 --> 03:28.469
Huh?
Can't plug anything in, right?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.210
The outlets are fucked!
The-- Sorry.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.778
These wires aren't even wires,
so by all rights,

03:33.909 --> 03:35.476
this lamp shouldn't
even turn on.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.696
But it does, right?

03:38.827 --> 03:40.611
Which means that,

03:40.742 --> 03:42.700
no matter what's going on
with the outlets or the wires,

03:42.831 --> 03:44.833
what comes out here

03:44.963 --> 03:47.401
is the electricity
that lights the bulb.

03:47.531 --> 03:48.663
You follow me so far?

03:48.793 --> 03:50.534
- Yes.
- Okay. All right.

03:53.145 --> 03:56.671
Now, this, this came here
in the back of someone's car,

03:56.801 --> 03:58.803
which means that,
by all accounts,

03:58.934 --> 04:01.023
this item is completely useless

04:01.153 --> 04:02.416
here in our
lovely little hamlet.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.200
Go ahead.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.463
But if we take
the ends of the wire,

04:06.594 --> 04:08.987
all right,
and affix it to the socket -

04:09.118 --> 04:13.078
the very place to which actual,

04:13.209 --> 04:18.127
bona fide electricity is
somehow being delivered -

04:18.258 --> 04:20.825
and we screw our little light
bulb here back in,

04:20.956 --> 04:22.740
and then...

04:28.180 --> 04:29.051
Madam.

04:33.882 --> 04:34.883
Whoa!

04:35.013 --> 04:36.711
Huh? You see?

04:36.841 --> 04:39.583
With enough lamps
and enough wire...

04:39.714 --> 04:40.889
We could turn Colony House
into a giant battery.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.673
Yes!

04:42.804 --> 04:46.590
Gold star for Tea Cup!

04:46.721 --> 04:48.679
I'm sure you would have
figured it out eventually.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.291
Hoo!

04:51.421 --> 04:54.990
Do you guys have any snacks?
I'm feeling peckish.

05:04.434 --> 05:07.481
Do you think they
know where they are?

05:07.611 --> 05:08.699
What?

05:08.830 --> 05:09.961
The bugs,

05:10.092 --> 05:15.967
the cows, birds.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.274
Do you think they know

05:18.405 --> 05:20.232
the horrible things
they're surrounded by?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.452
That they aren't where
they should be or...

05:25.194 --> 05:27.936
Does Mr. Worm just think...

05:28.066 --> 05:32.027
..."Here's some dirt,"
just like any other dirt?

05:32.157 --> 05:34.899
You know,
if you cut a worm in half,

05:35.030 --> 05:37.337
it grows back into two worms?

05:38.816 --> 05:41.602
What's your point?

05:41.732 --> 05:44.735
My point is worms
are fucking creepy.

05:44.866 --> 05:48.522
I'm sure it feels
right at home here.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.698
What do you think
dragged the tent?

05:50.828 --> 05:52.656
I don't know.

05:56.181 --> 05:59.054
Where do you think we are?

05:59.184 --> 06:01.665
I think it's time we find out.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.600

08:36.603 --> 08:38.256
- Now, listen.

08:38.387 --> 08:41.172
The trick to making this all
work is conducting wire. Right?

08:41.303 --> 08:43.131
Just like the wire we're
gonna run from the radio

08:43.261 --> 08:45.176
up to the roof of Colony House,

08:45.307 --> 08:48.092
we need enough wire to run from
the lamps inside Colony House

08:48.223 --> 08:49.964
out to the radio itself.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.488
Tea Cup,
tell them where we get it.

08:52.619 --> 08:56.144
Well, basically
anything with a cord

08:56.274 --> 08:58.102
that came into town
in the back of someone's car -

08:58.233 --> 09:01.541
appliances, electronics,

09:01.671 --> 09:04.848
even the wiring harnesses
in the cars themselves.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.111
Um, you know, that ambulance
outside the clinic?

09:07.242 --> 09:08.983
Probably a gold mine.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.028
Well, there's plenty
of stuff in storage here,

09:11.159 --> 09:12.856
so my kids and I,
we're gonna start in there,

09:12.987 --> 09:15.946
and anyone who wants
to join us is welcome to.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.079
And the rest of you,
scour whatever you can.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.560
If we can get enough wire
stripped and spliced,

09:20.690 --> 09:22.387
we can be sending out a
transmission before nightfall.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.347
All right,
you heard the man.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.088
Spread the word
and let's get to work.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.307
Let's go, people. Chop, chop.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.700
Yep.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.400
All right, nice job, man.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.272
Sorry. Gotta go.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.017
Hey! Hey!

09:43.147 --> 09:44.627
His name is Jim!

09:44.758 --> 09:46.063
What?

09:46.194 --> 09:48.283
My father's name is Jim.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.460
Uh, yeah. No,
I actually, uh-- I knew that.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.244
You're such an asshole.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.985
I'm sorry. Am I...?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.987
What am I supposed to do here?

09:57.118 --> 09:58.467
Julie?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.904
It's fine.
I'll be right there.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.732
Oh, okay, all right.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.778
This is like a...

10:04.908 --> 10:07.171
It's like
a father-daughter thing.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.133
This is, uh--
this is a really nice moment.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.351
You're standing up for your dad.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.310
Good for you.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.311
Just cut out the 'Tea Cup' shit.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.313
Fine.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.097
But I'm calling you
'Spark Plug' from now on.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.839
I like you. Good talk.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.928
- I'll see you up there.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.381
You missed Jade's big speech.

10:43.512 --> 10:46.515
Yeah, probably for the best.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.560
I thought you'd be
up at the house by now.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.911
No, I'm gonna
help Kristi gather

10:51.041 --> 10:54.436
whatever wire she can
from the ambulance.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.787
All those different places,

10:57.918 --> 10:59.528
different roads,

10:59.659 --> 11:02.139
yet everybody ended up here.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.666
You really think sending out

11:06.796 --> 11:08.319
some radio signal's
gonna make a difference?

11:09.538 --> 11:11.322
I hope so.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.498
Radio waves travel
in ways that we can't,

11:13.629 --> 11:15.849
so who knows, right?

11:17.154 --> 11:19.504
Yeah.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.942
Well, best get at it, I guess.

11:24.553 --> 11:25.946
Thank you.

11:54.452 --> 11:57.717
So, how does Troy feel
about giving up the goods?

11:57.847 --> 12:00.371
Well, I mean, he wasn't
thrilled about it,

12:00.502 --> 12:01.721
but we had a little chat.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.117
What's with the lamp?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.424
Uh, I had this
in the trunk of my car

12:09.554 --> 12:11.731
when we drove in.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.429
It, uh-- it was my desk lamp
back in college.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.388
Cute.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.740
It, uh, doesn't work here, and I
can't even plug it in, but, uh,

12:20.870 --> 12:22.872
it was nice to have
something from home

12:23.003 --> 12:24.613
that was close by, you know?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.224
The globe actually opens up.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.661
My roommate in college
was a bit of a klepto,

12:29.792 --> 12:32.360
so it was kinda like
my secret hiding spot.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.361
Really?

12:33.491 --> 12:34.536
Yeah.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.407
What do you keep in there now?

12:36.538 --> 12:38.279
Funny you should ask.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.414
Back, uh-- back in school,

12:43.545 --> 12:46.591
I used to sit
at my desk sometimes,

12:46.722 --> 12:49.638
staring at all
the different countries,

12:49.769 --> 12:52.249
thinking about all the places
I'd travel to someday.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.251
When I got here,

12:54.382 --> 12:57.167
I actually started writing
some of those places down.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.604
Everywhere I'd go,

12:59.735 --> 13:00.997
everything I'd see...

13:04.696 --> 13:06.437
...if we ever got to go home.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.094
Let's see it.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.010
Hand it over.

13:16.578 --> 13:19.973
Oh, man. I remember these.

13:20.103 --> 13:23.628
The infamous drug store receipt.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.152
This is quite a list.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.806
I had a lot of time.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.592
Costa Rica, Hawaii...

13:30.722 --> 13:33.421
Iceland - nice.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.250
Well, have you-- have you been?

13:36.380 --> 13:38.513
I hardly got past
Grand Rapids.

13:38.643 --> 13:41.821
Always wanted to, though.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.476
Well, maybe--

13:45.607 --> 13:49.306
if this radio
thing works, maybe...

13:49.437 --> 13:51.265
maybe we could go...

13:51.395 --> 13:53.180
together.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.660
Uh...

13:55.791 --> 13:58.533
It doesn't have to be Iceland.
I mean, there's--

13:58.663 --> 14:00.404
there's a lot of choices
on that list, you know?

14:00.535 --> 14:01.362
Yeah.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.845
Look, Kenny...

14:08.630 --> 14:10.066
I like you...

14:12.764 --> 14:14.462
a lot.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.510
But...

14:22.774 --> 14:24.646
I'm engaged.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.392
You know that.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.524
No. Right. I-I do.

14:33.655 --> 14:36.745
Uh, no, I get it.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.878
I shouldn't-- I'm so sorry.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.662
I shouldn't have, uh...

14:40.792 --> 14:42.751
I-I'm gonna...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.710
I'm gonna take this first batch
of wires up to the house

14:45.841 --> 14:48.713
because they're probably
itching to get started.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.498
Um, I'll see you up there.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.326
I'm sorry.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.458
Okay.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.330
Okay.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.736
Ah, bit of a wreck,

15:11.867 --> 15:13.564
but you should be able
to find something in there

15:13.695 --> 15:14.565
that'll do the trick.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.524
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.265
Gimme a holler
if you need anything.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.615
Okay.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.487
Hey, how come you're not up
there at the Colony House

15:23.618 --> 15:24.749
with everyone else?

15:24.880 --> 15:27.622
You mean why aren't I
working on the magic tower

15:27.752 --> 15:28.710
that's gonna bring
everybody home?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.147
Yeah.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.714
You don't think
it's gonna work?

15:32.844 --> 15:34.803
Ah.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.892
Let's just say I've seen a lot
of people with clever ideas

15:37.023 --> 15:39.199
about how they're
gonna get out of here.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.679
You wanna know what
they all had in common?

15:41.810 --> 15:44.421
They always end up at the bar.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.642
- Happy hunting.
- Yeah.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.582
She said she had some
stuff in the basement...

16:18.455 --> 16:19.369
Hi.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.415
Hey.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.590
Can I talk to you
for a second?

16:22.720 --> 16:25.810
Yeah, of course.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.378
Uh, not here.
I need you to come with me.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.817
We have a lot to do here.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.689
Yeah. I know. I know,
but it's-- it's important.

16:34.819 --> 16:38.693
Um, yeah.
Let me just, um...

16:38.823 --> 16:40.825
Yeah, just put that right here.
We'll be right back, okay?

16:40.956 --> 16:42.610
- Come on.

16:49.660 --> 16:52.315
- Ellis, where are we going?
- Just a little further.

16:56.798 --> 16:57.712
All right, and we're here.

16:59.496 --> 17:02.586
We're where?

17:02.717 --> 17:03.805
Well, this is
where I was standing

17:03.935 --> 17:07.026
the very first moment
that I saw you.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.637
You were driving around
in your little Volkswagen Bug,

17:09.767 --> 17:12.857
going around and around
for hours.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.990
You hadn't even had
your tires blown out yet,

17:15.121 --> 17:17.645
but you pulled over
right over there.

17:17.775 --> 17:20.648
You stepped outta your car
and looked around.

17:20.778 --> 17:23.564
I remember.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.609
I asked Corey for directions.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.698
Yeah.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.659
What are we doing?

17:31.789 --> 17:33.791
Well...

17:33.922 --> 17:38.579
I've been thinking a lot...

17:38.709 --> 17:39.884
about what you said,

17:40.015 --> 17:42.887
about going home,

17:43.018 --> 17:45.847
about who we'd be,

17:45.977 --> 17:48.980
and, you know,
I realized something -

17:49.111 --> 17:51.722
I don't even remember
anymore who I was

17:51.853 --> 17:53.637
before you stepped
out of that car.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.730
And I don't want to
find out who I am without you.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.603
Ellis.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.092
You are the love of my life.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.662
And we could be anywhere.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.055
I mean, we could be here,
we could be there,

18:20.186 --> 18:22.101
we could be anywhere
in the world,

18:22.231 --> 18:24.755
but it would not matter
because you are my home.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.759
And I would really
like to be yours.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.120
I love you.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.127
Okay, wait.
Is there a "but" coming?

18:49.911 --> 18:51.695
There's no "but."

18:51.826 --> 18:53.567
Okay, um...

18:56.352 --> 18:58.876
Here.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.967
So, unfortunately, all of
the jewelry shops were closed,

19:03.098 --> 19:05.927
but I got you this really
stylish piece of wire.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.757
Is that from my pile?

19:09.887 --> 19:10.932
Yes.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.160
Hey. What--
what's wrong?

19:24.032 --> 19:27.166
Your dad's gonna
be really happy.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.743
Where are we going?

19:39.874 --> 19:41.963
Well, the light
came from this direction.

19:42.093 --> 19:45.662
So, we're just
marching towards it?

19:45.793 --> 19:48.970
Yeah, that's it.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.841
Do you think
that's a good idea?

19:50.972 --> 19:52.974
You got a better one?

19:53.104 --> 19:54.715
Did you even hear
what I said last night?

19:54.845 --> 19:55.803
Yeah, I heard you.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.544
Will you just stop, please?

19:57.674 --> 19:59.198
Look.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.635
Look, we got dragged out
into the middle of nowhere

20:01.765 --> 20:04.551
by God knows what.

20:04.681 --> 20:07.118
I-I don't even know which
direction is back to town.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.816
All I do know is that
someone shined a light

20:08.946 --> 20:10.731
from that direction.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.123
And that wasn't a flashlight.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.909
That was a floodlight,
maybe a searchlight,

20:15.039 --> 20:17.041
which means that maybe
there's someone or something

20:17.172 --> 20:18.869
out this way that can help us.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.741
So we're going that way.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.266
And what if whoever it is
doesn't want to help?

20:24.397 --> 20:26.225
Then we got a different kind
of problem on our hands.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.708
The voice I heard last night,
it was different.

20:31.839 --> 20:32.883
It wasn't like the others.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.930
Yeah, you said.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.018
Who is Mr. Fish and Loaves?

20:40.151 --> 20:42.066
It's me.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.025
Mr. Fish and Loaves -

20:44.155 --> 20:47.202
it's a nickname I had
back in the service.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.683
Only two people who would've
known that name is Ellis--

20:49.813 --> 20:50.814
And your wife.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.644
Yeah.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.386
Do you think she...?

20:57.517 --> 20:58.822
What?

20:58.953 --> 21:01.782
What are you asking me?

21:01.912 --> 21:04.959
Did my dead wife
send you a message?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.917
Is that what
you wanna know?

21:07.048 --> 21:08.832
You brought me out here because
you thought I could help.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.965
Okay?
Look where we are!

21:11.095 --> 21:13.968
Whoever or whatever that voice
was, it told us to go back.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.100
It told us what would happen
if we stayed out here.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.015
Well, unless it told you
which direction to--

21:18.146 --> 21:19.408
Help!

21:19.539 --> 21:22.106
Boyd, what's wrong?

21:22.237 --> 21:24.021
Someone please, help me!

21:25.980 --> 21:27.764
Boyd?

21:27.895 --> 21:28.765
Hello?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.856
Where are you?
Keep talking!

21:32.987 --> 21:35.119
Boyd, who are
you talking to?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.904
I'm over here. Help!

21:37.034 --> 21:37.905
Where? I can't...

21:43.345 --> 21:45.434
Boyd, stop!
What are you doing?

21:45.565 --> 21:46.783
Shh!

21:53.921 --> 21:54.835
Abby?

21:59.927 --> 22:00.971
Abby? Babe?

22:03.060 --> 22:04.758
No, no! No!

22:04.888 --> 22:06.760
No! No!

22:09.850 --> 22:12.461
Ahh! Ayy!

22:18.902 --> 22:20.991
Ahh!

22:21.122 --> 22:23.951
Ugh! God!

22:25.909 --> 22:26.954
Wait! Oh!

22:30.131 --> 22:31.959
What the...? Ow!

22:32.089 --> 22:33.526
Ahh! Get it--

22:33.656 --> 22:34.962
I got it! I got it!

22:35.092 --> 22:36.833
Ahh...

22:46.060 --> 22:47.148
What did you see?

22:50.020 --> 22:52.936
Nothing. Nothing.

23:07.081 --> 23:07.995
Hey, guys.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.087
How are you gonna
get it up there?

23:13.217 --> 23:14.131
Well, we're gonna hoist it.

23:18.571 --> 23:21.225
Yeah, see, once we get
the antennae up on the roof,

23:21.356 --> 23:23.053
they'll be tall enough

23:23.184 --> 23:25.186
to broadcast a signal
out over the treetops.

23:25.316 --> 23:26.187
Cool.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.634
You okay?

23:38.765 --> 23:40.854
Yeah, I'm good.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.031
I'm gonna go inside
and see if anybody needs help.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.819
I'm here if you need me.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.996
Okay.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.172
I wish Victor was here.

23:55.303 --> 23:58.219
I bet he'd really
like this.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.569
Well, I'm sure,
wherever he is, he's okay.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.615
Oh, I know.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.226
He's got to do
his part right now.

24:05.356 --> 24:08.838
- His part?
- Of the quest.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.928
He's probably doing something
pretty important right now.

24:12.059 --> 24:14.017
That's his part.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.455
Doing this is our part.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.675
That's right.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.372
Boyd, slow down.

24:21.503 --> 24:24.114
I'm fine.
Just keep moving.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.899
We should look
at those spider bites.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.422
I said I'm fine.

24:27.553 --> 24:30.120
No, you're not.
What happened back there?

24:30.251 --> 24:31.470
Don't worry about it.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.386
You heard something,
didn't you?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.867
I need you to
talk to me, please!

24:38.999 --> 24:41.131
What?

24:41.262 --> 24:42.829
What do you
wanna talk about?

24:42.959 --> 24:46.833
You wanna talk about providence?

24:46.963 --> 24:49.966
'Cause there's no way out.
Is there?

24:53.274 --> 24:55.668
This fucking place!

24:55.798 --> 24:58.366
This place...

24:58.497 --> 25:01.021
fucking makes you think that
you're doing the right thing.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.545
It gives you hope, then it...

25:03.676 --> 25:07.244
then it takes it away,
like it's feeding on your pain.

25:07.375 --> 25:10.204
You want to feed on my pain?
You want my pain?

25:10.334 --> 25:12.989
You want fuckin' pain?!
You want my fuckin' pain?!

25:13.120 --> 25:14.730
Come on! Get it!

25:14.861 --> 25:16.993
I...
I'm waiting!

25:17.124 --> 25:18.995
Guys!

25:19.126 --> 25:19.996
Boyd...

25:21.476 --> 25:24.131
Ah!

25:24.261 --> 25:26.176
Shit.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.004
What's wrong?

25:28.135 --> 25:30.311
Ah! I don't know!

25:30.441 --> 25:32.443
My head's...

25:32.574 --> 25:34.663
I mean,
I don't feel right, not...

25:34.794 --> 25:36.926
Goddamn spider bites!

25:37.057 --> 25:39.059
Fucking...

25:41.365 --> 25:42.976
Hey, we have to keep moving.

25:43.106 --> 25:46.283
Jeez, where? Huh?

25:46.414 --> 25:49.156
- I don't know.
- Where? Tell me.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.462
Towards the light.
Remember?

25:51.593 --> 25:53.203
We have to get
towards the light.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.118
Hey, fuck the lights!

25:55.249 --> 25:57.120
There's no way outta here.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.122
The voice you heard
in your head is right -

25:59.253 --> 26:00.602
we're gonna die out here.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.692
Then, you're never
gonna see your son again.

26:05.346 --> 26:06.956
Is that what you want?

26:11.047 --> 26:11.961
Okay.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.052
Okay.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.880
Come on. What?

26:23.190 --> 26:24.974
Let me help you.

26:33.504 --> 26:34.941
Yeah.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.246
Come on.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.120
Hold up.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.037
A storm is coming.

26:45.299 --> 26:48.345
Then we better move quick.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.391
All right, we're good.
Bring it up.

27:04.100 --> 27:11.804
♪

27:11.934 --> 27:13.022
Where are you headed?

27:14.502 --> 27:17.026
- What?
- Where are you going?

27:17.157 --> 27:20.900
Uh, I'm just gonna help bring up
the rest of the wire.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.076
No, they already brought
the last batch up.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.080
Right.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.995

27:29.125 --> 27:30.300
I'm going to get
my rolling papers.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.215
Sorry, rolling paper!

27:32.346 --> 27:34.478
I've got one left and
I've been saving it. Okay, Dad?

27:34.609 --> 27:37.264
Is that all right with you?

27:37.394 --> 27:41.224
I know how offensive
you find my proclivities!

27:42.312 --> 27:44.140
Whatever.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.639
Oh, I didn't realize
you'd be here.

28:04.770 --> 28:08.251
I, uh...
I left something in my bedroom.

28:20.524 --> 28:24.267
So, uh...

28:24.398 --> 28:27.314
we might be going home.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.055
Home?

28:31.187 --> 28:33.450
That's pretty exciting, right?

28:36.802 --> 28:38.238
It's just
you don't seem very excited.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.462
You know,

28:45.593 --> 28:48.422
I grew up in France
with my grandma.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.037
She died when I was 12.

28:55.168 --> 28:58.432
I had to come back to
the States, live with my uncle.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.265
I had to, uh-- I had to ride
on the plane by myself

29:05.395 --> 29:07.136
because there was, um...

29:07.267 --> 29:10.879
there was no one to... you know.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.275
And I didn't want to go.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.407
I mean, I didn't
want to leave France

29:17.538 --> 29:19.148
because...

29:21.150 --> 29:23.022
she...

29:25.372 --> 29:28.070
She didn't have any other
family who lived there.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.250
I didn't want to
leave her alone.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.909
I mean, she was dead, but...

29:46.872 --> 29:48.787
I was crying
at the airport, and...

29:51.659 --> 29:53.182
this nice lady
bought me a soda.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.054
I told her what was wrong.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.058

30:01.103 --> 30:03.497
She said to me...

She said to me,

30:09.677 --> 30:14.116
they come with you when you go.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.218
So I guess--

30:29.349 --> 30:31.090
I guess what I'm just
trying to say is...

30:35.137 --> 30:37.096
don't be sad...

30:40.316 --> 30:42.492
and don't feel guilty.

Okay.

So, take the screwdriver,
and we touch it to the coil,

31:35.458 --> 31:37.808
and that's what
determines the frequency.

31:37.939 --> 31:41.508
Now, if I move it
along the coil,

31:41.638 --> 31:44.467
that's kinda like
changing the channel.

connect to this?

43:49.931 --> 43:51.411
We just need
to find shelter.

43:51.541 --> 43:53.761
- Sara--
- I'm not leaving you here!

43:53.892 --> 43:55.633
Sara, look up.

43:58.026 --> 44:00.942
Nathan was right
about this place.

44:01.073 --> 44:03.423
It's angry now.
You have to get inside.

44:03.553 --> 44:05.425
Over there.

44:05.555 --> 44:06.774
You'll be safe in there.

44:09.081 --> 44:10.822
The tree. The tree!
We'll be safe there.

44:10.952 --> 44:12.475
What are you--

44:12.606 --> 44:13.433
Just--
just trust me! Please!

44:13.563 --> 44:14.956
Oh, fuck!

44:15.087 --> 44:16.262
Good! There.

44:16.392 --> 44:17.742
Good, good, good!

44:17.872 --> 44:18.830
There.

44:22.137 --> 44:24.096
- Get in.
- What?

44:24.226 --> 44:26.228
We have to get inside.
We'll be safe in there.

44:26.359 --> 44:28.361
How do you--

44:28.491 --> 44:29.884
I'll be right behind you.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.326
I'll follow behind--

44:42.592 --> 44:44.769
Sara, what...

44:55.910 --> 44:57.912
Hey, hello?

44:59.958 --> 45:02.047
