that you put the medical waste bin

09:17.041 --> 09:19.750
too far away from
the hand sanitizer dispenser.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.417
So if I'm examining a patient,

09:21.500 --> 09:23.417
that means that I have to cross the room

09:23.500 --> 09:26.667
to dispose of the medical
supplies, recross the room,

09:26.750 --> 09:28.417
sanitize my hands,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.375
which means you have
doubled my exposure time

09:30.458 --> 09:32.291
and wasted my time.

09:32.375 --> 09:35.000
So fix this station and
fix the other three stations.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.041
Actually, you know what?
Find someone else to do it,

09:37.125 --> 09:38.333
because you've just proven

09:38.417 --> 09:40.667
why we haven't let residents
actually do anything.

09:40.750 --> 09:41.875
-Richard] Dr. Altman.

09:42.542 --> 09:43.709
Can I help you?

09:43.792 --> 09:44.834
Can I send Dr. Helm upstairs

09:44.917 --> 09:47.041
to help out on the COVID floor?

09:47.125 --> 09:48.667
Bailey's asking for reinforcements.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.792
I don't care.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.750
[flatline]

09:57.834 --> 09:59.250
[Maggie] Charge to 200.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.083
[paddles whine]

10:02.166 --> 10:03.458
Clear.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.083
[defibrillator thumps]

10:05.166 --> 10:06.500
Charge to 300.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.500
Clear.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.417
[defibrillator thumps]

10:10.500 --> 10:12.667
[flatline]

10:16.041 --> 10:17.792
Time of death, 2:13.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.709
[click, flatline stops]

10:23.542 --> 10:24.917
I didn't even know his whole name.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.542
Do you want to?

10:29.625 --> 10:31.583
His wife would call him every day.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.583
She'd talk his ear off
on the speaker phone.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.750
I don't speak Spanish,
but I could hear kids playing.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.583
Maybe grandkids.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.291
I could hear his wife crying.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.834
And then she would force a laugh.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.000
And sometimes his eyes were open.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.917
And... he would force a smile,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.542
you know, when she would force a laugh

10:45.625 --> 10:47.875
'cause he was trying to take
care of her through the phone.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.542
His first name is Hector.

10:49.834 --> 10:52.166
And yes, I'd like to know his last name

10:52.250 --> 10:53.709
for my prayers, please.

10:55.458 --> 10:56.583
Martinez.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.083
Hector Martinez.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.458
-Is Grey still awake?
-Yes.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.250
Yeah, she's still awake.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.750
All right.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.917
[cellphone chiming]

11:12.417 --> 11:15.041
[sighs]

11:18.959 --> 11:21.750
[door opens, closes]

11:26.709 --> 11:28.709
[sirens wailing in distance]

11:28.792 --> 11:29.875
All right, we got the girls upstairs,

11:29.959 --> 11:33.041
so the coast is clear down here
for... Satan's arrival.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.792
Do they know what this guy was doing?

11:34.875 --> 11:37.125
Is he, like, a serial killer?
In a pandemic?

11:37.208 --> 11:39.583
Sex trafficking is more likely.
The house they burned down

11:39.667 --> 11:42.375
could have been a way station
or the destination.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.625
I don't want to be anywhere near this guy.

11:52.041 --> 11:55.291
[Bob coughing]

11:55.375 --> 11:57.500
[Travis] 45-year-old male
involved in a house fire.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.333
Smoke inhalation, burns to the left arm.

11:59.417 --> 12:00.458
Vitals are stable.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.125
[Owen] The victims are safe, Montgomery.

12:02.208 --> 12:03.625
You mean the girls who broke into my house

12:03.709 --> 12:04.959
and set fire to it?

12:05.041 --> 12:06.542
[Travis] They could have
burned alive in there.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.709
He's human garbage.
Get these cuffs off me!

12:08.792 --> 12:10.333
I want my lawyer. Now.

12:10.417 --> 12:11.917
He's also gonna say that a lot. Good luck.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.208
-[coughs]
-We've already informed security.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.458
Let's get him to trauma one.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.667
-Ma'am?
-What happened to the guy

12:18.750 --> 12:20.417
who just came out
of the ambulance? Is he okay?

12:20.500 --> 12:23.041
Ma'am, you can't be out here
without a a mask.

12:23.125 --> 12:24.834
Okay, yeah. Thank you very much.

12:24.917 --> 12:27.834
I just, um... I'm a little...out of it.

12:27.917 --> 12:29.750
I just was mugged, and, um,

12:29.834 --> 12:31.625
the guy, he-- he shoved me
and took my purse,

12:31.709 --> 12:33.291
and I hit my head, I think.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.333
You'd think people would
behave better in a pandemic.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.250
Come on. Follow me.
I'll get you checked out.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.125
[Jackson] So, I made a few calls,

12:51.208 --> 12:53.000
and my attorney's looking into
your mother's arrest.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.834
We should know more pretty soon.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.375
-[Woman on PA] <i>Code Blue, Room 5260.</i>
-Man: Room 5260 coding. Let's go.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.750
It's okay.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.291
I know it may not sound like it,

12:59.375 --> 13:01.291
but you're safe here, Jada. You are, okay?

13:01.792 --> 13:03.291
We are gonna get your mother out of there.

13:03.417 --> 13:04.750
[Jada] She didn't--

13:04.834 --> 13:06.542
She didn't do anything wrong.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.083
She was just scared...

13:10.166 --> 13:12.959
trying to protect us. [sighs]

13:13.041 --> 13:14.417
We never should have
met up with a stranger.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.834
It was so dumb.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.166
He's the bad guy here, not you.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.375
You're 13 years old, Jada.

13:19.458 --> 13:22.750
You should be allowed to make
a few mistakes and survive them.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.667
That's kind of what
growing up is all about.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.333
When I was 15 years old,
took my mother's car.

13:27.417 --> 13:28.959
Didn't have a driver's license yet.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.208
Picked up my buddies, driving
around, trying to show off,

13:31.291 --> 13:33.417
spin the tires, you know, burn rubber.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.959
Caught a patch of ice. Crashed sideways.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.667
Could have killed everyone
'cause I did something stupid.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.291
Still ended up being a doctor.

13:42.542 --> 13:43.792
You made a mistake.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.834
You learned from it, right?

13:47.166 --> 13:48.792
What that guy did, that was no mistake.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.166
He did that on purpose.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.458
So he's the one that we're mad at.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.500
You want to be mad at somebody,

13:53.583 --> 13:54.917
be mad at him, not yourself.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.875
[inhales deeply] Okay.

14:00.083 --> 14:01.834
[Bob coughs, grunts]

14:04.125 --> 14:05.875
Can you at least loosen these damn things?

14:05.959 --> 14:07.208
If you would calm down and stop moving,

14:07.291 --> 14:08.542
it might not bother you so much,

14:08.625 --> 14:10.750
and it would help me to work on your arm.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.375
Oh, they burned down my house,
and I got arrested.

14:12.458 --> 14:13.667
Would <i>you </i>be calm?

14:16.208 --> 14:18.125
Oh, don't tell me you believe them.

14:18.208 --> 14:21.458
Sir, not only do I believe
them, but I'm amazed by them.

14:21.542 --> 14:24.417
They are resourceful, powerful, brilliant.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.166
You know, my own sister

14:26.250 --> 14:28.792
was taken hostage by scumbags like you.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.417
She was held for 10 years.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.166
And these girls, they got
themselves out in one night,

14:32.250 --> 14:33.959
and they risked their lives to do it.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.750
Now, it is my job to repair
your lungs and your skin,

14:36.834 --> 14:40.500
and I need your cooperation to
do that, but your life, Bob...

14:40.583 --> 14:43.083
your life will be spent behind bars.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.792
And your soul? [chuckles]

14:44.875 --> 14:47.041
There is nothing
anyone can do to save that.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.417
You're the devil's barbecue, Bob,

14:48.500 --> 14:50.959
so get used to the smell of burning flesh.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.291
[grunts] Get me another doctor.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.917
I want another doctor!

14:55.000 --> 14:56.834
I've been through enough...

14:56.917 --> 14:59.125
without... hav--

15:02.875 --> 15:04.500
[Owen] Okay, dramatic move, Bob.

15:06.208 --> 15:09.166
Let's call a stroke alert
and have CT on standby.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.792
[Woman on PA] <i>Code stroke, emergency room.</i>
<i>Code stroke, emergency room.</i>

15:10.917 --> 15:12.041
Doesn't look like you sustained
any serious injuries

15:12.125 --> 15:13.208
from your fall.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.834
<i>Code stroke, emergency room.</i>

15:14.917 --> 15:16.333
[Opal] Um, what's--
what's going on in there?

15:16.417 --> 15:17.750
[Owen] Let's get ready to move him.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.375
Ugh. You don't want to know.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.083
Anything else hurting you?

15:23.166 --> 15:25.458
Any soreness or...

15:25.542 --> 15:27.917
Have someone from neuro meet me in CT.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.208
He has slurred speech and focal deficits.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.083
Possible stroke. Let's go.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.041
Ma'am?

15:35.125 --> 15:37.000
Oh. [exhales sharply] Sorry.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.500
Been alone for months.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.041
I'm not used to all this activity.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.875
Um, can I...

15:41.959 --> 15:43.333
Where is your restroom?

15:43.417 --> 15:44.875
Oh, yeah, it's just around the corner.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.375
Thanks.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.000
[door opens]

15:50.083 --> 15:51.208

15:51.959 --> 15:53.917
Ksracick: Uh, you can go.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.375
-[clears throat]
-[door closes]

15:55.458 --> 15:56.750
[Meredith] It got you, too, huh?

15:56.834 --> 15:59.875
[Koracick] Like an 18-wheeler
on a sheet of ice.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.834
But I, uh...

16:01.917 --> 16:03.750
I just wanted to see for myself

16:03.834 --> 16:05.375
that it's possible to beat this thing.

16:05.458 --> 16:06.709
<i>Almost </i>beat it.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.291
You know how many rules
you're breaking right now?

16:09.375 --> 16:12.709
I really just wanted to be in
a room where no one was dying.

16:15.166 --> 16:16.750
'Cause everyone's dying.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.625
I won't tell if you don't.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.917
[sighs]

16:36.041 --> 16:37.458
[Amelia] Whatcha got?

16:37.542 --> 16:38.709
[Owen] I didn't mean for them to page <i>you.</i>

16:38.792 --> 16:40.208
If you need to be with Meredith...

16:40.291 --> 16:42.417
I want to be wherever
I can help and save lives,

16:42.500 --> 16:44.458
so it is your guy's lucky day.

16:44.542 --> 16:46.917
Well, slurred speech,
slight droop in the face,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.667
left-sided weakness in the arms and legs.

16:48.750 --> 16:52.000
He was also just arrested for
kidnapping two teenage girls,

16:52.083 --> 16:53.875
possibly trafficking.

16:53.959 --> 16:56.083
I'm not sure that this is
a life you're looking to save.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.458
I've already said a few things to this guy

16:57.542 --> 16:59.166
that could get me fired.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.917
Well, then...

17:02.000 --> 17:03.458
I guess I am his best chance

17:03.542 --> 17:06.333
at living long enough
that he will rot in prison.

17:06.417 --> 17:08.333
-[chuckle]
-Silver lining?

17:08.417 --> 17:09.792
[computer beeps]

17:09.875 --> 17:11.375
Okay, looks like an ischemic stroke.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.750
Let's start Alteplase and get a CTA.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.250
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.917
[DeLuca] Ah, Bailey. Good.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.917
Uh, Abrams and Richardson are settled,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.208
and I want to wait
on Lottman's ABG results.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.875
Make sure she's stable.

17:33.709 --> 17:36.333
Um, DeLuca, can you
get Mr. Franklin settled?

17:37.625 --> 17:38.834
Dr. Bailey?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.917
Uh, my mom died in that room last night.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.917
I just need a minute.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.166
-Dr. Bailey...
-Hmm.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.125
...you're superhuman.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.417
You know that, right?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.083
You got an ability to cut through crap

17:55.166 --> 17:57.250
unlike anyone I have ever seen.

17:57.583 --> 18:00.375
You're a world-class surgeon
and an even better boss.

18:01.417 --> 18:03.208
So please don't mistake this as disrespect

18:03.291 --> 18:04.917
when I say...

18:05.125 --> 18:06.875
go away.

18:07.291 --> 18:08.542
Go home.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.041
At the very least, go to your office

18:11.125 --> 18:13.041
and scream, break
something-- I don't know.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.333
Just take more than a minute.

18:16.458 --> 18:20.458
Because, yes, even superhumans
need more than a minute

18:20.583 --> 18:23.291
to grieve the loss of the person
that made them who they are.

18:24.542 --> 18:25.667
We got this.

18:27.917 --> 18:29.041
Go away.

18:34.458 --> 18:35.709
[door opens]

18:36.250 --> 18:38.291
[DeLuca] Okay. How we doing here?

18:47.625 --> 18:48.792
[Amelia] Fluoro.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.583
[ventilator hissing, monitor beeping]

18:52.667 --> 18:56.417
He's got a clot
in his middle cerebral artery.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.500
Are the girls he hurt okay?

19:01.458 --> 19:03.959
I mean... okay as they can be?

19:04.041 --> 19:06.041
I hope so, but I cannot imagine.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.625
Was the world always this messed up

19:07.709 --> 19:10.625
and we just didn't pay attention
'cause we didn't have kids yet?

19:10.709 --> 19:12.208
Yeah, I notice more now.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.542
I just want to hug Scout and never let go.

19:15.583 --> 19:18.208
You know, after drenching
myself in sanitizer.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.291
[chuckles]

19:20.375 --> 19:22.500
I can't even go home
to hug Allison and Leo.

19:23.792 --> 19:26.500
They're staying at my mom's,
and I see them on video chat.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.625
It is a special kind of torture.

19:29.709 --> 19:32.583
[scoffs] Sensory deprivation.
I just--

19:33.583 --> 19:36.625
Ugh. I just want to smell them
and hold them.

19:37.792 --> 19:40.166
Well, at least I have a pandemic
to keep me occupied.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.667
[chuckles] That's dark.

19:41.750 --> 19:42.959
You know, when all this started,

19:43.041 --> 19:45.208
I treated it like it was a war,
like we were all this together,

19:45.291 --> 19:46.750
but we're not in this
together-- not even close.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.667
I mean, some of us are risking our lives,

19:49.750 --> 19:52.583
missing our families,
sacrificing everything, and why?

19:52.667 --> 19:54.875
So other people can just keep
finding ways to hurt each other?

19:54.959 --> 19:57.125
I mean, kidnapping teenagers
during a pandemic?

19:57.917 --> 19:59.083
Don't even get me started

19:59.166 --> 20:00.875
on all those people who
are partying without masks.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.125
I think you said those things
in the wrong order.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.041
I'm not so sure. [scoffs]

20:07.208 --> 20:08.667
[both laugh]

20:08.750 --> 20:10.083
-[Meredith] Just the facts, huh?
-Yeah!

20:10.166 --> 20:11.583
[Koracick] Neurosurgeons
are the best lovers

20:11.667 --> 20:13.000
of all the surgeons.

20:13.083 --> 20:16.041
It's the attention
to the smallest of details.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.417
We know about, uh, pleasure centers.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.959
Okay. It's been very nice
having you stop by.

20:21.041 --> 20:23.083
[laughing] You're welcome
to prove me wrong.

20:23.166 --> 20:24.625
Ortho?

20:24.709 --> 20:25.875
Forget about it. No finesse.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.625
Anesthesiology?

20:27.709 --> 20:30.458
-Snooze. Literally.
-[both laughing]

20:30.542 --> 20:31.667
[coughs]

20:32.166 --> 20:35.166
If this thing ever ends,
I am creating a dating app

20:35.375 --> 20:37.542
for women who want to date a neurosurgeon,

20:37.625 --> 20:39.041
and that would be me.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.542

You know, you don't realize how
addicted you are to saving lives

20:48.875 --> 20:50.500
until you can't.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.709
I realized it.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.375
How hilarious is it

20:56.458 --> 21:01.125
that the best and second-best
surgeons in this joint

21:01.208 --> 21:02.542
caught the plague?

21:02.625 --> 21:04.667
You're not the second-best surgeon here.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.208
[laughing] You might be top five.

21:07.291 --> 21:09.333
[chuckling] Wait. Wait, you--

21:09.417 --> 21:11.625
you thought I put you at number one?

21:11.709 --> 21:14.542
Oh, that is-- [laughing]
that is so sad.

21:21.583 --> 21:22.709
Good one.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.250
[Woman] I can't believe
we lost another one.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.834
[Man] We did our best.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.000
[Teddy] Six more beds,
nine more vital monitors,

21:40.083 --> 21:42.750
and we will meet protocol standards.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.250
Nice work, Altman.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.083
It'll fill up before we know it,
but I guess it's something.

21:47.166 --> 21:49.542
Well, when I said not everyone
would be needed here,

21:49.625 --> 21:50.750
I meant it.

21:50.834 --> 21:53.166
-If you need to take personal time.
-That's a joke, right?

21:53.250 --> 21:54.875
You've been burning
the candle at both ends

21:54.959 --> 21:56.375
trying to save Meredith.

21:56.458 --> 21:57.667
You've earned a break.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.417
Meredith doesn't matter, Richard.

22:00.792 --> 22:04.500
I'm saying it's great that she's awake.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.333
But I thought if I-- if I could--

22:07.417 --> 22:10.917
if I could just keep her alive,
that meant something.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.208
And now she's awake,
and nothing has changed.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.458
And we are in a frickin' cafeteria.

22:16.625 --> 22:18.625
People used to take breaks in here,

22:18.709 --> 22:20.583
and they would eat
ice cream and French fries,

22:20.667 --> 22:22.583
and we-- now we just converted it

22:22.667 --> 22:24.250
so that they would die here instead.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.750
So, taking a break won't save anyone.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.583
And I don't have anywhere to go anyway.

22:30.875 --> 22:32.208
And that's on you.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.375
And you know it's on you.

22:37.417 --> 22:39.667
Feeling sorry for yourself

22:39.750 --> 22:41.667
doesn't save lives.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.208
You aren't gonna get better
until you take the time

22:45.291 --> 22:47.709
to find out why you did what you did.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.250
You blew up your life

22:49.333 --> 22:51.250
and profoundly hurt and humiliated

22:51.333 --> 22:52.500
the man that you love.

22:52.583 --> 22:53.792
You need to take inventory.

22:54.792 --> 22:55.917
Name your demons.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.750
Clean up your messes.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.166
You may not be able to get
things back the way they were,

23:00.250 --> 23:03.125
but if you honestly look at yourself,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.417
maybe you won't repeat
the same pattern again.

23:29.125 --> 23:31.083
I will be. I just need a minute.

23:31.917 --> 23:34.625
I'm sorry, but you have to
keep your mask on.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.083
Do you want to sit down?

23:43.667 --> 23:45.709
My daughter, she was taken,

23:45.792 --> 23:47.875
and I almost lost her forever.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.667
Oh, my God. I heard about that.

23:50.959 --> 23:54.333
I can only imagine what
you must be feeling right now.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.000
You know, I spend my whole day

23:56.083 --> 23:58.208
just trying to get to the end of it
still standing.

23:58.291 --> 24:00.333
And there's always something,

24:00.417 --> 24:02.083
but I find ways to deal
with the somethings.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.458
I try to get ahead of them.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.917
But you can't get ahead of everything.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.333
It's too much stress.
It's too much. I'm so sorry.

24:07.417 --> 24:09.542
And you know what's crazy?
I have to get up

24:09.625 --> 24:12.208
and go to work in the morning
and act like nothing happened.

24:12.291 --> 24:15.875
Because we have to eat and
have a roof over our head.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.667
Even in a pandemic.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.542
There's no stopping. There's no relief.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.792
I need to get back to my girl.

24:39.834 --> 24:41.834

24:41.917 --> 24:43.917
No, he's not. I know.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.458
I know. I just have to figure out

24:45.542 --> 24:46.875
how to get close enough to him

24:46.959 --> 24:48.291
to find out what they already know.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.166
No, because he may have had a stroke.

27:49.208 --> 27:51.834
Saving a sex trafficker's life.

27:51.917 --> 27:54.750
So... I needed some air.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.667
How did you manage to not...

27:58.333 --> 28:00.709
stab him in the skull with a scalpel?

28:01.166 --> 28:02.625
Skin of my teeth.

28:04.375 --> 28:08.000
I easily could have let the catheter
slip by a millimeter,

28:08.083 --> 28:09.125
lacerate his artery,

28:09.208 --> 28:12.709
or I could have accidentally
let him have a bigger stroke,

28:12.792 --> 28:14.333
landing him in a vegetative state,

28:14.417 --> 28:17.041
sitting in his own filth
for decades, but I didn't.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.000
Because I took an oath.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.166
I saved his life so amazingly well

28:21.250 --> 28:24.041
that he will live
far longer than he should,

28:24.125 --> 28:27.709
until he dies alone in prison.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.875
[sighs] I'm so sick of it.

28:35.083 --> 28:37.875
I'm so sick of it.
I know. It's infuriating.

28:37.959 --> 28:39.208
How anyone could kidnap children--

28:39.291 --> 28:41.083
No. That's not it, Amelia.

28:42.041 --> 28:43.125
That's not it.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.041
You're outraged.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.792
Everyone is outraged

28:48.875 --> 28:51.583
that this monster kidnapped these girls.

28:51.667 --> 28:53.041
And that is awful.

28:53.125 --> 28:54.291
It's awful.

28:54.917 --> 28:57.458
But what about the monsters
that got us here?

28:58.333 --> 29:00.291
The many reasons that
Black girls are more vulnerable

29:00.375 --> 29:02.125
to being taken in the first place?

29:02.208 --> 29:05.041
I want outrage for that.
I want outrage for the fact

29:05.125 --> 29:09.250
that we are seen as disposable,
and rarely seen as victims.

29:09.333 --> 29:10.750
That Black girls are less likely

29:10.834 --> 29:13.125
to be as seen as innocent
than white girls,

29:13.208 --> 29:15.667
which makes people think that
we don't need protecting,

29:15.750 --> 29:17.834
and it's okay to hypersexualize us
in the media.

29:17.917 --> 29:21.208
Meanwhile, we are being
physically and sexually abused

29:21.291 --> 29:24.792
at horrific rates, and not
just by sex traffickers.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.917
There are so many things
just waiting to rob Black women and girls

29:28.000 --> 29:31.959
of our freedom and future and our joy.

29:33.083 --> 29:37.291
And because none of it has
an evil or obvious face,

29:37.375 --> 29:39.041
it just gets ignored.

29:41.667 --> 29:42.917
And now...

29:43.792 --> 29:47.375
there's a plague that is
killing Black people

29:47.458 --> 29:51.625
at a rate that should
