WEBVTT

00:10.678 --> 00:11.929
Hey, what's up Henry?

00:11.971 --> 00:13.221
Same old thing.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.222
(locker beeps)

00:15.223 --> 00:16.684
(locker honks)

00:16.725 --> 00:18.644
Oh, come on.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.603
(locker honks)

00:19.645 --> 00:21.146
Stupid thing.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.191
(locker beeps)

00:25.150 --> 00:26.276
Show off.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.281
Ugh.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.701
Hey char, can I borrow

00:31.907 --> 00:33.701
your chemistry notes?

00:33.742 --> 00:34.910
(locker honks)

00:34.952 --> 00:36.787
Ugh! Why?

00:37.621 --> 00:40.165
Okay. I'll borrow Jasper's.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.918
My lock is broken again.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.213
Ugh. Dang public schools.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.217
Hey, will you...

00:53.637 --> 00:54.596
What?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.974
Use your Whiz-Watch

00:55.138 --> 00:56.974
to open the lock.

00:57.016 --> 01:00.644
No. What if someone sees?

00:57.016 --> 01:00.644
I'll create a distraction.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.521
You know

01:00.686 --> 01:02.521
I'm not supposed to--

01:04.690 --> 01:06.859
(screams)

01:07.860 --> 01:08.736
What? What's wrong?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.238
(chatter)

01:14.909 --> 01:17.118
Okay, I'm fine now.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.915
Thank you.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.915
Yep.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.209
(Piper)

01:22.875 --> 01:24.209
Henry!

01:24.960 --> 01:27.963
Henry, I am gonna

01:24.960 --> 01:27.963
kill you!

01:28.380 --> 01:30.465
Hey, you're not supposed to be

01:28.380 --> 01:30.465
in the middle school hallway.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.885
Where's my phone?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.885
Wh--

01:32.927 --> 01:34.845
I don't know

01:32.927 --> 01:34.845
where your phone is.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.890
Hey Henry, quick question.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.890
Get out of here!

01:38.432 --> 01:40.059
(whimpers)

01:40.893 --> 01:41.936
Look, Piper,

01:41.977 --> 01:43.395
I don't

01:41.977 --> 01:43.395
have your phone, okay?

01:43.437 --> 01:44.897
So you just need to--

01:45.856 --> 01:48.901
Oh. I must've

01:45.856 --> 01:48.901
picked it up by mistake.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.866
Dang it.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.866
What?

01:55.908 --> 01:59.327
You butt dialed

01:55.908 --> 01:59.327
Jana Tetrazzini.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.707
So?

02:00.537 --> 02:03.707
I hate Jana Tetrazzini.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.835
Then why do you keep

02:04.165 --> 02:06.835
her number in your phone?

02:08.503 --> 02:11.298
Because if she calls me,

02:11.339 --> 02:15.218
I need to know it's her

02:11.339 --> 02:15.218
so I can ignore it.

02:16.095 --> 02:18.555
Love you.

02:16.095 --> 02:18.555
Who cares?

02:20.975 --> 02:23.143
And this is

02:20.975 --> 02:23.143
my favorite hallway.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.020
It's very nice.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.606
And those are my friends.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.606
Henry. Charlotte.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.984
Hey, man.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.526
This is Ortho.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.526
He's new here.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.028
Ah. Hey.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.028
What's up?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.238
Doesn't Ortho have

02:33.528 --> 02:35.238
thick hair?

02:37.365 --> 02:38.867
Thick.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.867
Sure.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.995
I've asked you

02:38.909 --> 02:40.995
to stop doing that.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.331
So, how do you

02:42.121 --> 02:44.331
like our school so far?

02:44.372 --> 02:46.041
It's nice.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.251
Hey, can you tell me about

02:46.083 --> 02:48.251
the school's main water supply?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.880
Our water supply?

02:51.922 --> 02:53.256
Yes. You know, the water

02:53.298 --> 02:55.383
that all the teachers

02:53.298 --> 02:55.383
and students here drink.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.928
Why do you want

02:56.259 --> 02:57.928
to know about that?

02:57.970 --> 02:59.930
I have reasons.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.933
Sorry, Ortho.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.393
They don't really tell us

03:02.975 --> 03:05.393
about our water supply.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.395
I see.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.397
Hey, does this school

03:07.437 --> 03:09.397
have security cameras?

03:10.357 --> 03:13.485
Security cameras?

03:10.357 --> 03:13.485
Yes. Where are your cameras?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.405
There might be

03:15.570 --> 03:17.405
some outside.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.824
I don't think

03:17.447 --> 03:18.824
we have security cameras

03:18.866 --> 03:20.034
here in the hallways.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.994
That's good news.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.121
Hey, Ortho,

03:22.161 --> 03:24.121
you want to see my locker?

03:24.163 --> 03:25.664
Yes, immediately.

03:27.875 --> 03:28.667
(locker beeps)

03:30.502 --> 03:32.796
This is where

03:30.502 --> 03:32.796
I keep my books, my lunch.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.091
And this is Captain Man.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.091
He came to my birthday party.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.553
Oh, I know

03:37.634 --> 03:39.553
all about Captain Man.

03:40.137 --> 03:44.975
And one day, hopefully,

03:40.137 --> 03:44.975
my father will take care of him.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.270
What do you mean

03:47.352 --> 03:49.270
by that?

03:49.312 --> 03:51.732
Take care

03:49.312 --> 03:51.732
of Captain Man how?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.819
I shouldn't say. We're still

03:52.733 --> 03:55.819
in the planning phase.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.659
Isn't he neat?

04:04.870 --> 04:05.954
It all just kind of

04:04.870 --> 04:05.954
happened.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.331
My dad was

04:05.996 --> 04:08.331
an irresponsible scientist.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.458
I wanted an afterschool job.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.336
And by accident,

04:10.500 --> 04:13.336
he made me indestructible.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.588
(screams)

04:14.629 --> 04:16.339
(Henry)

04:14.629 --> 04:16.339
I went into this crazy store

04:16.924 --> 04:18.633
and met

04:16.924 --> 04:18.633
a pretty interesting guy.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.385
I'm going to blow your mind.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.764
Now I protect the good citizens

04:20.427 --> 04:23.764
of swellview who call me...

04:23.805 --> 04:25.099
And he turned out to be...

04:25.140 --> 04:26.266
You know the name.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.143
Captain Man.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.143
That's right, Henry.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.645
In time, I realized

04:28.185 --> 04:30.645
that being a superhero

04:30.687 --> 04:32.606
is a lot to handle alone.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.815
He wanted some help.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.025
(Ray)

04:33.857 --> 04:35.025
I needed a sidekick.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.651
>> I, Henry hart...

04:36.693 --> 04:38.112
(Ray)

04:36.693 --> 04:38.112
Pledge to never ever, ever

04:36.693 --> 04:38.112
tell anyone...

04:38.153 --> 04:39.905
That I'm Captain Man's

04:38.153 --> 04:39.905
secret sidekick.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.906
It is done.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.282
(Henry)

04:40.948 --> 04:42.282
Now we blow bubbles.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.491
(CRay)

04:42.323 --> 04:43.491
And fight crime.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.910
(Henry)

04:43.533 --> 04:44.910
Feels good.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.050
Call it.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.635
Up the tube!

05:02.427 --> 05:03.344
Oh, my boots.

05:03.971 --> 05:04.638
(Ray screams)

05:08.976 --> 05:12.980
Oh, yes.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.980
Oh, you're a nice thing.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.356
Gooch! What happened?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.776
Why did you send me

05:15.398 --> 05:17.776
an emergency signal?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.779
Look.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.779
That's a garbage juicer.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.116
A garbage juicer?

05:24.158 --> 05:25.826
It juices garbage.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.621
Gooch, I was busy downstairs

05:26.326 --> 05:29.621
researching criminals.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.789
(Gooch)

05:29.663 --> 05:30.789
Watch.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.044
I just dump the garbage

05:32.249 --> 05:36.044
into the thingy.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.468
Gooch...

05:40.799 --> 05:43.468
Now, observe.

05:52.811 --> 05:59.234
You see? The garbage is gone.

05:52.811 --> 05:59.234
It's all in the juice.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.988
Can I go back downstairs now?

06:06.908 --> 06:08.118
Ray, we got to talk to you.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.828
(Charlotte)

06:08.160 --> 06:09.828
This is important.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.164
There's a creepy new kid

06:10.495 --> 06:12.164
at our school.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.957
Ugh, can we talk

06:12.206 --> 06:13.957
about it downstairs?

06:13.999 --> 06:16.501
Gooch's juice smells.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.501
Okay.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.336
I'm coming too.

06:23.175 --> 06:26.928
Good God,

06:23.175 --> 06:26.928
that's a band-dude.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.810
Why do you think this

06:31.641 --> 06:33.810
Ortho kid is up to something?

06:33.852 --> 06:36.479
Well, he was asking about

06:33.852 --> 06:36.479
the school's water supply.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.191
And he wanted to know

06:36.521 --> 06:39.191
about the security cameras and--

06:39.233 --> 06:40.399
(elevator buzzes)

06:40.441 --> 06:42.903
(screaming)

06:42.944 --> 06:45.613
I wonder why he was asking

06:42.944 --> 06:45.613
about those things?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.326
Guys?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.326
Oh, stop screaming.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.962
Can't that elevator

06:59.211 --> 07:00.962
be adjusted?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.590
Why do you say

07:01.796 --> 07:03.590
this Ortho kid is creepy?

07:03.631 --> 07:05.384
Because he says

07:03.631 --> 07:05.384
weird stuff.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.221
And he's got this crazy,

07:05.800 --> 07:09.221
psycho look in his eye.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.430
You got a pic?

07:10.471 --> 07:11.681
(both)

07:10.471 --> 07:11.681
Uh...

07:11.723 --> 07:13.725
Jasper's Twitflash.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.725
Oh, yeah.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.436
Jasper posted a pic of him

07:13.767 --> 07:16.436
and Ortho on his Twitflash.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.147
Then I say we look

07:16.477 --> 07:19.147
at Jasper's Twitflash.

07:24.152 --> 07:28.115
Bucket. Bucket.

07:24.152 --> 07:28.115
Selfie with bucket.

07:29.741 --> 07:33.620
Bucket. Bucket.

07:29.741 --> 07:33.620
Ah. That's Ortho right there.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.834
Hmm. He's a boy, all right.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.754
A boy that's up to

07:40.543 --> 07:42.754
no good.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.256
Oh, give him a break.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.465
(both)

07:44.298 --> 07:45.465
What?

07:45.506 --> 07:46.800
The kid's new to your

07:45.506 --> 07:46.800
school,

07:46.841 --> 07:48.218
he's probably just

07:46.841 --> 07:48.218
a little awkward.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.137
Let's not make mumps

07:48.260 --> 07:50.137
out of marshmallows.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.306
He also threatened you.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.306
Me?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.890
What'd that little

07:52.347 --> 07:53.890
marsh mump say?

07:53.932 --> 07:56.810
That his father was going

07:53.932 --> 07:56.810
to "take care" of you.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.687
Oh, did he?

07:56.851 --> 07:59.687
Well, we'll just see about...

08:00.855 --> 08:04.318
Wait. He said his father

08:00.855 --> 08:04.318
was going to take care of me?

08:04.359 --> 08:05.860
Yep.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.860
Sure did.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.489
Put that kid's pic back up

08:06.320 --> 08:09.489
on the monitor and zoom in.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.912
That hair. You guys

08:11.992 --> 08:15.912
ever heard of Drill Finger?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.164
Those little pickles?

08:17.205 --> 08:18.623
I think those

08:17.205 --> 08:18.623
are dill fingers.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.500
I love dill fingers.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.500
This is not about pickles.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.378
I'm talking about a dentist.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.921
Named Drill Finger?

08:23.420 --> 08:24.921
Yeah.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.633
He used to be a dentist before

08:25.422 --> 08:28.633
he turned to a life of crime.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.261
Three years ago he kidnapped

08:29.050 --> 08:31.261
the mayor of Swellview

08:31.303 --> 08:34.139
and removed all his teeth,

08:31.303 --> 08:34.139
which left him toothless.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.725
That's why he only eats soup.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.725
Exactly.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.603
And what happened

08:38.768 --> 08:40.603
to Drill Finger?

08:40.645 --> 08:42.647
I captured him

08:40.645 --> 08:42.647
and took him to jail.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.816
But he was released

08:42.689 --> 08:44.816
three weeks ago.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.154
That's Drill Finger.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.573
Does he always wear a mask?

08:49.612 --> 08:52.573
Yeah, but look at his hair.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.536
Just like Ortho's.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.288
Gooch.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.580
Hey, I can't talk now.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.500
I'm on the phone

08:59.622 --> 09:01.500
with my nephew, Benji.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.751
He has the chicken pox.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.753
Do you remember

09:03.793 --> 09:05.753
when I put Drill Finger in jail?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.506
Of course.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
What were his exact words

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
as they took him away?

09:09.590 --> 09:12.593
He said, "As soon

09:09.590 --> 09:12.593
as I get out of here,

09:12.635 --> 09:14.637
I'm going to take care

09:12.635 --> 09:14.637
of Captain Man."

09:15.222 --> 09:17.598
That's what I thought.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.598
Great. I got to go.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.188
So, Ortho is the son

09:20.560 --> 09:23.188
of Drill Finger.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.523
I knew it. I knew it.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.774
I knew that boy was evil.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.774
I knew it.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.943
Yeah, but did you know it?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.943
I did.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.654
But what are they up to?

09:32.364 --> 09:33.740
(sighs)

09:34.741 --> 09:36.326
Well, I guess I'm not

09:34.741 --> 09:36.326
going to figure it out

09:36.368 --> 09:38.912
just by wearing a loud shirt

09:36.368 --> 09:38.912
and stroking my chin.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.623
What do we do?

09:42.665 --> 09:43.791
I'm going to do

09:42.665 --> 09:43.791
a little spying

09:43.833 --> 09:46.336
on your new classmate, Ortho.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.338
I'm going to have to figure out

09:46.378 --> 09:48.338
a way into your school,

09:48.796 --> 09:50.631
maybe as a substitute teacher.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.966
Well, you can't just wait

09:52.008 --> 09:53.676
until one of our teachers

09:52.008 --> 09:53.676
gets sick.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.514
Hmm. Good point.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.514
I'll have to think of a plan.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.104
Try stroking your chin.

10:16.908 --> 10:20.412
There. That's one of Henry's

10:16.908 --> 10:20.412
teachers, Miss Shapen.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.538
Let's do this.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.623
My chicken pox itch.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.626
Benji, just remember,

10:23.664 --> 10:26.626
never tell anyone about this.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.545
Okay, Uncle Gooch.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.131
Now!

10:31.172 --> 10:32.507
Tronya!

10:32.549 --> 10:36.470
What? Hey! Stop! Ah! Oh!

10:32.549 --> 10:36.470
What is going on?

10:36.511 --> 10:38.638
(screaming)

10:45.353 --> 10:47.147
(chatter)

10:47.730 --> 10:48.982
Hey, guys!

10:50.317 --> 10:51.443
Hey, guys!

10:51.485 --> 10:52.611
Hold on a second.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.611
Hey, guys.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
(silence)

10:56.197 --> 10:58.450
Principal says Miss Shapen

10:56.197 --> 10:58.450
has chicken pox.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.452
All right, free day.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.162
(cheering)

11:02.203 --> 11:04.247
No, no, no. No.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.291
He said we're getting

11:04.289 --> 11:06.291
a substitute.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.627
(groaning)

11:10.211 --> 11:12.005
You don't think Ray...

11:12.547 --> 11:13.840
Nah, he wouldn't.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.009
(Ray, speaking with accent)

11:13.881 --> 11:16.009
Hello, children.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.387
Everyone,

11:17.594 --> 11:19.387
please take your seats.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.642
It seems your regular teacher

11:20.221 --> 11:23.642
has caught the pox of a chicken.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.478
Nasty red bumpies all over.

11:27.437 --> 11:34.277
But not to worry, I am

11:27.437 --> 11:34.277
your substitute, Mr. Gelding.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.032
Ray, are you kidding me?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.032
Shh, I know what I'm doing.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.741
This is not going to work.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.741
It might work if you...

11:40.783 --> 11:42.035
you look ridiculous.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.035
...just sit down

11:42.076 --> 11:43.161
Can you talk to me

11:42.076 --> 11:43.161
about this?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.412
No, I can't talk to you

11:43.203 --> 11:44.412
about this.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.746
Sit down and trust me.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.540
(Henry protests)

11:45.788 --> 11:46.540
Sit down, boy!

11:46.581 --> 11:48.333
Yes, Mr. Gelding.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.130
Now, then,

11:51.252 --> 11:54.130
let's have a roll call.

11:54.673 --> 11:58.593
We'll start with first names

11:54.673 --> 11:58.593
that begin with the letter "O."

11:59.135 --> 12:01.388
My name is Oliver.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.388
Shut up, Oliver.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.600
Where's, uh, where's Ortho?

12:09.437 --> 12:12.065
Hello, Ortho.

12:17.070 --> 12:21.908
(Ray)

12:17.070 --> 12:21.908
Now then, class, who can tell

12:17.070 --> 12:21.908
me about the isosceles triangle?

12:22.325 --> 12:25.953
Sir? This is a history class.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.082
Who can tell me about

12:26.663 --> 12:29.082
the history

12:29.123 --> 12:30.917
of the isosceles triangle?

12:32.210 --> 12:35.796
Ortho, what do you know?

12:35.838 --> 12:39.342
I... I'm new.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.887
Excuse me, Mr. Gelding.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.515
Can I please talk

12:43.762 --> 12:45.515
to you out in the hall?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.892
I'm in the middle

12:45.557 --> 12:47.892
of a lesson.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.186
I have a question

12:47.934 --> 12:50.186
about my personal hygiene.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.397
To the hall we go.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.858
Hey, I have lots of questions

12:52.439 --> 12:55.858
about my hygiene.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.904
What are you doing?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.904
Why are you in my school?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.197
I'm spying on Ortho.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.365
Will you stop

13:01.239 --> 13:02.365
with the accent?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.284
(speaking normally)

13:02.407 --> 13:04.284
I'm spying on ortho.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.703
Well, what'd you do

13:04.325 --> 13:06.703
with our regular teacher?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.248
I gave her a disease.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.248
Oh my god.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.292
Just chicken pox.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.294
That's the worst kind of pox.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.294
What about tuna pox?

13:14.335 --> 13:16.337
There's no such thing

13:14.335 --> 13:16.337
as tuna pox.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.964
Look, you and Charlotte

13:16.379 --> 13:17.964
were the ones that said

13:18.005 --> 13:18.715
Ortho's up to no good.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.216
I know--

13:20.258 --> 13:21.635
We already know his dad

13:20.258 --> 13:21.635
is Drill Finger.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.137
Now we just need to figure out

13:21.676 --> 13:24.137
what they're planning.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.974
You guys, Jasper keeps

13:25.513 --> 13:27.974
asking me questions

13:28.015 --> 13:30.101
about his personal hygiene.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.894
So?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.396
So you better

13:31.936 --> 13:33.396
get back to class

13:33.438 --> 13:35.189
before I tell him things

13:33.438 --> 13:35.189
he does not want to know.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.859
Okay. You clear on the plan?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.859
No.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.111
Let's go.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.740
I just want to know

13:41.446 --> 13:43.740
if I should use different soaps

13:43.782 --> 13:45.199
for different parts of me.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.201
Shh.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.332
(speaking with accent)

13:49.287 --> 13:52.332
Now, history is filled with

13:49.287 --> 13:52.332
stories of evil nasty people.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.001
Who can name some?

13:52.373 --> 13:55.001
Ooh. Genghis Khan.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.586
Yes.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.586
Voldemort.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.879
Good one.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.879
Big bird.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.048
Absolutely. Now...

14:01.549 --> 14:05.804
Who can name

14:01.549 --> 14:05.804
some other evil people? Ortho?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.641
Um...

14:07.054 --> 14:09.641
Oh, think, Ortho.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.687
Surely you must know someone

14:10.308 --> 14:13.687
with evil intentions.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.897
Like maybe someone planning

14:13.728 --> 14:16.897
to sabotage this school?

14:17.691 --> 14:18.775
Yeah, Ortho.

14:19.484 --> 14:23.363
I-I don't understand.

14:19.484 --> 14:23.363
What are your plans?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.701
After class I plan to eat

14:25.365 --> 14:27.701
a Turkey wrap.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.661
Ah ha.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.831
You, student,

14:30.328 --> 14:32.831
examine Ortho's Turkey wrap.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.500
What is going on?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.380
Wrap's clean.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.262
Now, students,

14:44.384 --> 14:48.262
to really know history,

14:48.304 --> 14:50.056
we must first

14:48.304 --> 14:50.056
learn your history.

14:51.057 --> 14:55.311
Therefore, tomorrow shall be

14:51.057 --> 14:55.311
Bring Your Father to Class day.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.439
All our fathers?

14:58.481 --> 15:00.692
No, let's just start

14:58.481 --> 15:00.692
with one father.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.361
My father lives

15:01.317 --> 15:03.361
in our basement.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.946
Put your hands

15:04.237 --> 15:05.946
over your face.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.535
Ortho. You bring your father

15:07.657 --> 15:10.535
to class tomorrow.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.329
Okay.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.957
Look, I put

15:14.414 --> 15:16.957
your wrap back together.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.213
(Oliver)

15:20.044 --> 15:22.213
I can't breathe.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.509
Hey, ortho.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.509
Hi.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.969
Sorry our teacher was being

15:26.551 --> 15:28.969
so weird to you.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.638
Ah, it's okay.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.307
I just wish that your friend

15:30.680 --> 15:33.307
hadn't mutilated my Turkey wrap.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.186
Yeah... Oh!

15:37.228 --> 15:38.563
I got you a present.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.441
It's a mini bucket.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.778
Thanks.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.946
You can keep anything

15:44.819 --> 15:46.946
in there, paper clips,

15:46.987 --> 15:48.239
buttons, corn.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.577
Cool. I've always wanted to

15:49.783 --> 15:52.577
eat corn out of a small bucket.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.704
Who hasn't?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.123
(phone ringing)

15:57.791 --> 16:01.878
Hello, father.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.878
Did you get the message?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.672
Right. You need to be

16:01.920 --> 16:04.672
at school tomorrow.

16:05.005 --> 16:08.509
Yes. Afterwards, we can discuss

16:05.005 --> 16:08.509
the planning phase.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.640
Look.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.640
(screams)

16:14.265 --> 16:15.516
Don't do that.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.399
(Chatter)

16:23.983 --> 16:26.193
(bell rings)

16:26.235 --> 16:28.446
(speaking with accent)

16:26.235 --> 16:28.446
All right, lads and loonies.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.446
Rumps in chairs.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.787
Hello. Is this...

16:32.366 --> 16:35.787
Oh, hi, Ortho.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.038
Hello, father.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.917
(speaking normally)

16:38.080 --> 16:40.917
Well, if it isn't

16:38.080 --> 16:40.917
Ortho's daddy.

16:40.959 --> 16:44.128
Accent.

16:40.959 --> 16:44.128
(with accent)

16:40.959 --> 16:44.128
If it isn't Ortho's daddy.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.339
Yeah.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.339
Sorry I'm a little late.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.841
I had some things to do.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.427
What kind of things?

16:47.882 --> 16:51.427
Yeah, what things?

16:52.720 --> 16:54.430
Just some work stuff.

16:54.472 --> 16:57.475
So I was told it's Bring

16:54.472 --> 16:57.475
Your Father to Class day.

16:57.976 --> 17:02.062
That's right.

16:57.976 --> 17:02.062
Okay...

17:03.690 --> 17:05.900
So, now what?

17:08.152 --> 17:10.154
Maybe you could tell

17:08.152 --> 17:10.154
the children

17:10.196 --> 17:11.948
about the type

17:10.196 --> 17:11.948
of work you do and--

17:14.868 --> 17:17.537
Father!

17:14.868 --> 17:17.537
Oh, bad luck.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.373
It appears that ortho's father

17:17.578 --> 17:20.373
is having a medical episode.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.042
No, I think

17:20.414 --> 17:23.042
you did something to him.

17:24.335 --> 17:28.297
I'm calling my mom

17:24.335 --> 17:28.297
and then you'll be in big--

17:28.965 --> 17:30.967
Uh-oh, there goes Ortho.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.512
Good heavens... the

17:31.551 --> 17:34.512
medical problem must be genetic.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.556
We should take them

17:35.346 --> 17:36.556
to the school nurse.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.808
Good idea.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.808
Let's hurry up, shall we?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.476
Help me get Ortho.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.735
(Ray)

17:47.734 --> 17:48.735
Excuse me.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.070
Terribly sorry.

18:00.538 --> 18:04.042
Where are we?

18:00.538 --> 18:04.042
I don't know, son.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.128
Well...

18:08.170 --> 18:11.007
Well.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.884
We only do three Wells.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.884
Sorry.

18:13.801 --> 18:18.222
So, mister. Are you ready to

18:13.801 --> 18:18.222
admit that you're Drill Finger?

18:18.556 --> 18:21.308
What?

18:18.556 --> 18:21.308
Who's drill finger?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.436
You know you're Drill Finger.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.272
You're a psychotic,

18:24.270 --> 18:26.272
evil dentist.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.734
And now it's your turn

18:26.313 --> 18:29.734
to get drilled.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.071
What does that mean?

18:30.443 --> 18:33.071
I don't know, man.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.407
I'm not a dentist.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.493
I don't even floss.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.493
(loud beeping)

18:39.535 --> 18:40.661
Just a second.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.539
What, Gooch?

18:41.412 --> 18:43.539
I'm busy with Drill Finger.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.041
No you're not.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.084
Huh?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.711
Drill Finger was just spotted

18:47.293 --> 18:48.711
in Nebraska.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.089
Nebraska?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.089
Affirmative.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.842
He put four megatons of sugar

18:51.130 --> 18:54.842
into the water supply.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.428
Situation?

18:54.884 --> 18:57.428
Water very sweet.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.305
Teeth in danger.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.015
Understood.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.101
What do we do?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.145
Nothing.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.145
We only protect Swellview.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.772
Nebraska, not our problem.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.023
Right.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.234
But you guys...

19:12.276 --> 19:15.655
if the real Drill Finger

19:12.276 --> 19:15.655
is in Nebraska, who's that guy?

19:16.030 --> 19:18.074
He's my dad,

19:16.030 --> 19:18.074
you dip twits.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.618
But...

19:20.660 --> 19:22.495
But why'd you want to know where

19:20.660 --> 19:22.495
our school's water supply was?

19:22.536 --> 19:24.956
Because my uncle sells

19:22.536 --> 19:24.956
water filters

19:24.998 --> 19:27.541
for schools

19:24.998 --> 19:27.541
and small businesses.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.710
(all)

19:27.583 --> 19:29.710
Oh.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.171
Okay, but why did you ask

19:32.212 --> 19:34.007
about our school's

19:32.212 --> 19:34.007
security cameras?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.633
Because at Ortho's

19:34.048 --> 19:35.633
last school

19:35.675 --> 19:39.261
the security cameras caught him

19:35.675 --> 19:39.261
picking his nose.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.347
(all)

19:39.303 --> 19:41.347
Oh.

19:42.098 --> 19:45.351
After that, some of the other

19:42.098 --> 19:45.351
kids called me "booger boy."

19:45.392 --> 19:48.021
(laughing)

19:48.896 --> 19:50.523
Kids can be cruel.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.484
Okay, wait.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.277
Then why did you say

19:55.319 --> 19:56.946
your dad was going to

19:55.319 --> 19:56.946
"take care" of Captain Man?

19:56.988 --> 19:58.572
Yeah.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.574
Because my father owns

19:58.614 --> 20:00.574
a chain of retirement homes

20:00.616 --> 20:02.326
for old people.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.244
And I'm building a new

20:02.368 --> 20:04.244
one here in Swellview.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.372
It's still in

20:04.286 --> 20:06.372
the planning phase.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.126
And when Captain Man

20:08.166 --> 20:10.126
gets old,

20:10.168 --> 20:12.211
I hoped I could

20:10.168 --> 20:12.211
take care of him...

20:12.795 --> 20:17.050
To thank him for being

20:12.795 --> 20:17.050
such a wonderful superhero.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.259
(chuckles)

20:19.301 --> 20:21.470
Will you excuse

20:19.301 --> 20:21.470
us for just one second?

20:22.388 --> 20:23.681
We'll be right back.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.394
Okay, we screwed up bad.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.356
I better not get in trouble.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.356
Let's just calm down.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.526
Hey. Just know I am not going

20:32.398 --> 20:35.526
to jail for the two of you.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.236
Shh.

20:41.074 --> 20:45.703
Hey. So, good news.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.038
What?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.040
We've clearly made

20:47.080 --> 20:49.040
a mistake here.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.834
So we're going

20:49.790 --> 20:51.834
to let you both go.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.546
As long as you promise not

20:51.876 --> 20:55.546
to mention all this to anyone.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.090
Are you nuts?

20:57.131 --> 20:58.298
As soon as we

20:57.131 --> 20:58.298
get out of here,

20:58.340 --> 21:00.384
we're going

20:58.340 --> 21:00.384
right to the police.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.637
Well, in that case...

21:06.224 --> 21:07.433
What'd you do that for?

21:07.474 --> 21:10.436
Just help me get them down.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.436
Aw, man.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.115
Will you guys hurry up?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.202
What about

21:24.617 --> 21:26.202
when they wake up?

21:26.244 --> 21:27.661
They're going to

21:26.244 --> 21:27.661
get us in trouble.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.831
Not if they don't remember

21:28.037 --> 21:30.831
anything that happened.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.416
(whooshing)

21:35.044 --> 21:36.712
(whooshing)

21:38.589 --> 21:39.799
There.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.175
Now they won't

21:39.840 --> 21:41.175
remember anything?

21:41.217 --> 21:44.220
Not even where they live.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.220
Awesome.

21:45.930 --> 21:49.142
They're waking up.

21:45.930 --> 21:49.142
Run!

21:51.310 --> 21:53.229
(car engine starts)

21:53.271 --> 21:56.149
(car tires squeeling)

21:58.609 --> 22:01.904
Who are you?

21:58.609 --> 22:01.904
I think I'm...

22:03.114 --> 22:04.782
Booger boy.

22:33.644 --> 22:34.603
(oven bell rings)

22:34.645 --> 22:36.022
(man)

22:34.645 --> 22:36.022
Mmm...
