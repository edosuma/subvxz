00:13.883 --> 00:15.537
[curtain closes]

00:19.802 --> 00:21.717
In the name of the Father,
the Son,

00:21.760 --> 00:24.024
and the Holy Spirit.

00:24.067 --> 00:27.027
VICTOR: Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.596
We need to talk.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.251
Are there any sacraments
you do respect, Mr. LeConte?

00:35.513 --> 00:37.733
All of them.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.561
That's why I do what I do.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.998
That's why you do what you do.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.436
So holy men and women
can keep their hands clean.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.309
I won't help you with Kristen
and her daughter.

00:48.352 --> 00:49.701
VICTOR:
That's not what this is about.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.268
What "what" is about?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.705
The Monsignor
will be approaching you

00:53.749 --> 00:57.492
in the next few days
with an emergency assessment.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.581
You will do what is asked.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.191
Which is?

01:01.235 --> 01:03.498
I don't know.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.500
But someone
during the assessment

01:05.543 --> 01:08.024
will say the word "honky-tonk."

01:10.853 --> 01:12.855
When you hear this word,
you will count

01:12.898 --> 01:15.118
to the 12th word
spoken after it,

01:15.162 --> 01:17.381
and that is the word
you will bring back to me.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.168
Are you nuts?

01:21.211 --> 01:24.345
I couldn't be more
deathly serious.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.261
Once again, you will hear
the word "honky-tonk,"

01:27.304 --> 01:30.568
then you will count to the
12th word spoken after that.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.831
That is the word I need to hear.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.356
-And why am I doing this?
-That is confidential.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.924
All I can tell you is, it has
nothing to do with Kristen.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.926
When you have the 12th word,

01:40.970 --> 01:42.580
you will call this number.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.367
I'm leaving it here on the seat.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.933
You will call the number
and say,

01:47.977 --> 01:49.587
"My Shiba Inu is limping,

01:49.631 --> 01:52.112
and I need to speak
to Dr. Michael."

01:54.853 --> 01:57.160
This is all a game to you,
isn't it?

01:57.204 --> 01:58.901
A very serious game,

01:58.944 --> 02:01.382
and one we have to play
to protect the holy.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.214
Amen.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.259
Thank you, Father.

[clock ticking]

02:53.477 --> 02:56.306
Hi there.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.309
Long time no see.

02:59.353 --> 03:03.661
[softly]:
No, this is not...

03:03.705 --> 03:05.446
happening again.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.752
You were gone.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.580
Wake up, sleepyhead.

03:09.624 --> 03:12.235
Look who I have with me.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.671
Hi, Mom.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.239
No.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.372
Wake up.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.418
Wake up.

03:22.898 --> 03:26.597
Were you a good girl today
or a bad one?

03:26.641 --> 03:29.296
-I was good.
-Yay.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.385
Look at my new video.

03:31.428 --> 03:34.518
I'm getting a lot of upvotes.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.870
KRISTEN:
Close your...

03:38.914 --> 03:40.655
eyes.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.874
Close your eyes.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.615
Tighter.

[gasps]

[sighs]

04:01.328 --> 04:03.373
[phone buzzing]

04:09.161 --> 04:10.293
-Kristen?
-David, I need

04:10.337 --> 04:12.077
to talk to you right now.

04:12.121 --> 04:15.080
On my way.

-[knock on door]
-Come in.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.969
We need to talk.

04:35.536 --> 04:36.928
Good.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.934
I need some questions answered.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.073
Victor LeConte told me

04:51.116 --> 04:53.597
that I was being pursued
by Leland Townsend,

04:53.641 --> 04:55.251
from the very beginning,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.993
that he had designs
on one of my daughters,

04:58.036 --> 05:00.430
and that he was grooming her

05:00.474 --> 05:02.389
through me.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.868
Is this correct?

05:05.087 --> 05:07.350
-That's what he said.
-You don't believe him?

05:07.394 --> 05:09.918
I believe a spy sees everything
as a conspiracy.

05:09.961 --> 05:13.356
Okay, we'll get back to that.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.141
Everything that's happened
in the last two years,

05:16.185 --> 05:17.752
from the moment
that Leland approached me

05:17.795 --> 05:19.536
to now,

05:19.580 --> 05:21.712
has been by design?

05:22.931 --> 05:24.324
That's what Victor thinks.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.716
What about your designs?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.110
What do you mean?

05:28.153 --> 05:29.677
Your pursuit of me,

05:29.720 --> 05:31.505
from the moment
you invited me to do this job

05:31.548 --> 05:33.768
to our relationship now,

05:33.811 --> 05:35.422
has everything been by design?

05:35.465 --> 05:37.380
What?

05:37.424 --> 05:38.773
No.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.775
If Leland was pursuing me
from the beginning,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.690
are you saying that
it's just coincidental

05:42.733 --> 05:46.389
that you invited me to do
this job at that exact time?

05:46.433 --> 05:49.044
Look, I can't speak
to what Leland thinks.

05:49.087 --> 05:52.352
I can only say that I invited
you to be an assessor

05:52.395 --> 05:56.051
based on your talent,
not because of some design.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.357
And why should I trust you?

05:59.141 --> 06:00.621
Because I tell you the truth.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.101
No, you don't. No, you haven't.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.103
How long have you been working
for the Entity?

06:06.888 --> 06:09.804
All those mysterious phone calls
in the last couple weeks,

06:09.847 --> 06:12.154
they've all been
from this LeConte guy?

06:12.197 --> 06:14.199
And every time,
you lied about it?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.899
You can't even talk to me now

06:17.942 --> 06:19.944
because everything you say
will be a lie.

06:19.988 --> 06:23.774
I agreed to work
with Victor LeConte.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.646
He was doing good work,

06:25.689 --> 06:28.518
and I thought
it was a way to help God.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.302
And he asked you to lie to me.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.304
I couldn't tell anyone
about the work I did with them.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.654
I couldn't even tell
the Monsignor.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.438
KRISTEN:
David, I don't believe

06:35.482 --> 06:37.658
in God and the Church,
but I always liked that you did

06:37.701 --> 06:39.616
because it gave me
something to aspire to,

06:39.660 --> 06:41.575
something to admire.

06:43.315 --> 06:46.231
But you're
just like everyone else.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.026
[sighs]

06:58.069 --> 06:59.680
You're right.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.857
Forgive me.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.124
-So, now what?
-Now

07:09.167 --> 07:12.823
I tell you everything I know
about their pursuit of RSM.

07:12.867 --> 07:13.911
And Lexis?

07:13.955 --> 07:16.436
Yes.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.876
-Wait, wh-what are you doing?
-I have to go check something.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.921
And our work?

07:23.965 --> 07:26.446
I need the money,

07:26.489 --> 07:28.056
but I feel pretty fucked over,

07:28.099 --> 07:30.624
and it's gonna take me a while
to adjust to that.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.335
[phone whooshes]

08:01.089 --> 08:03.526
-[knock on door]
-[door opens]

08:03.570 --> 08:04.658
[sighs]

08:04.701 --> 08:07.399
-You okay?
-[groans]

08:07.443 --> 08:09.532
-Thank you.
-No problem.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.274
-What have you got?
-Okay.

08:13.623 --> 08:14.972
No,

08:15.016 --> 08:16.365
I want an adult drink.
I'm an adult.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.714
-I want to drink like one.
-[laughs]

08:17.758 --> 08:19.281
Okay.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.501
-Oh, my God.
-What?

08:21.544 --> 08:23.285
Even your adult drinks
look like kids' drinks.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.069
-I got it, I got it.
-Oh, no, I got it.

08:27.637 --> 08:28.943
So...

08:28.986 --> 08:31.032
-you want a progress report?
-I do.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.817
I'm sorry to be so anxious.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.343
Okay, this one is last year.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.389
Our first motion
for production of records.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.870
-Right.
-This one was six months ago.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.654
Our first lawsuit
for production of same.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.569
-Yeah.
-This is their first rejection.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.310
Okay, yeah, it's all
coming back to me.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.312
This one is two months ago.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.879
Our threatened lawsuit
of $43 million.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.489
[sighs] Right.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.492
This is RSM's alarmed response
one week later.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.582
And this... Whew, girl.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.367
This is the judge's
summary judgment against RSM

09:02.411 --> 09:04.935
to produce your missing egg
or be held liable.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.937
-And this-- smell this.
-[sniffs]

09:06.981 --> 09:08.852
[sniffs] You can almost
smell their sweat.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.768
That's what threatening a $43
million suit does to grown men.

09:11.812 --> 09:15.163
-[chuckles]
-Thank you, Yasmine.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.599
Mm.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.340
That's always the most fun part.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.516
They admitted
there was a 12th egg

09:20.560 --> 09:22.431
and that their filing system
made the error.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.867
So, I do have another egg
out there?

09:23.911 --> 09:26.174
And they have a lead on it.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.307
Okay, a lead.
Wh-What does that mean exactly?

09:29.351 --> 09:30.613
You may want another sip.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.223
-Uh-oh.
-I sued for their records,

09:32.267 --> 09:33.877
and they indicate
that your missing egg

09:33.921 --> 09:36.445
was mistakenly donated
to medical research.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.969
-Okay, so it's been destroyed?
-Probably.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.929
There is a chance your egg
was donated to a couple.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.931
Wait, what?

09:43.974 --> 09:46.107
Donated... donated where?

09:46.150 --> 09:48.022
This medical research facility
has donated eggs

09:48.065 --> 09:50.067
to recipient couples
in the past.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.939
I'll stay on it if you want.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.595
-Yeah, that would be great.
-Okay.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.081
Is Kristen on the team anymore?

10:04.125 --> 10:05.909
-Yes.
-Uh...

10:05.953 --> 10:07.563
I called her.
She said she's coming.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.391
KORECKI:
Okay, well, let's start.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.045
This is an emergency assessment.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.743
A friend of the parish
has a toy store,

10:13.787 --> 10:15.397
and this came from it.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.312
BEN: Okay. What are
we looking at, haunted toys?

10:17.355 --> 10:19.488
KORECKI:
Use the wand.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.316
WAND:
See you in hell.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.710
[chuckles] Okay.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.363
That's creepy, but, uh,

10:25.407 --> 10:27.322
probably just a prank
in the manufacturing.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.758
It's not just that toy.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.586
A lot of the toys
are causing problems.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.935
Kristen.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.633
KRISTEN:
Monsignor, Ben.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.373
David.

10:37.462 --> 10:40.161
-We getting costumes with that?
-Yeah, you're the princess.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.772
-A haunted toy store.
-Seriously?

10:42.816 --> 10:45.296
-WAND: See you in hell.
-KORECKI: The store manager

10:45.340 --> 10:46.776
has complained that his patrons

10:46.820 --> 10:48.778
have been returning
some of the items,

10:48.822 --> 10:51.563
and some have complained
of demonic infestation

10:51.607 --> 10:52.869
coming from the toys.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.392
-Sounds like busywork.
-Possibly,

10:54.436 --> 10:56.351
but just look into it.

10:56.394 --> 10:59.093
You're quiet today, David.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.790
Uh, long night.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.448
CHUCK:
These are the returns

11:06.491 --> 11:08.232
just from last week.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.018
-Everybody's terrified of them.
-BEN: Why?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.976
Just something creepy
about them.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.326
I showed the parish
the Little Princess Magic Wand.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.154
Here's four more, same thing.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.678
And the stuffed animals, too.
Look at them.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.117
-So, why did people buy 'em?
-CHUCK: They weren't like that

11:23.160 --> 11:24.858
when they bought them.
They were like this.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.469
These all look like knockoffs.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.949
You think there's a chance

11:28.992 --> 11:30.298
there was a problem
in the manufacturing?

11:30.341 --> 11:32.213
CHUCK: I guess, but what
is the problem?

11:32.256 --> 11:33.736
And why?

28:12.299 --> 28:15.084
We've located my, uh,

28:15.128 --> 28:18.653
-my missing egg, and, um...
-Mm-hmm.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.872
...it's been implanted,

28:19.915 --> 28:22.483
and the father thinks

28:22.526 --> 28:24.093
something may be wrong.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.486
-Like-like what?
-I don't know.

28:25.529 --> 28:29.098
Nothing. I-I mean,
he's just, um...

28:29.142 --> 28:32.014
I like the mother.
She-she, uh...

28:32.058 --> 28:34.103
I just don't want
anything bad to happen.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.497
[phone buzzing]

28:38.629 --> 28:39.587
Hey, David.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.329
Yup, he's here.

28:42.372 --> 28:45.462
Okay-doke, yup, we'll come.
Okay. Bye.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.160
-Another case?
-No, same one.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.945
-Another possessed toy.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.079
Did I give you what you wanted?

28:53.122 --> 28:55.472
I don't know.
It's just that the...

28:55.516 --> 28:58.214
the father's worried
about genetics,

28:58.258 --> 29:00.826
and I just don't know
what to tell him.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.002
Nature vs. nurture.

29:03.045 --> 29:05.308
That's what you say.

29:05.352 --> 29:08.398
I would bet on nurture
every time.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.272
Is that a friend speaking,
or a scientist?

29:12.315 --> 29:14.622
Both.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.888
LI:
Thank you for coming.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.804
The store manager told me
you were looking into these...

29:22.848 --> 29:24.066
strange cases.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.546
Can you tell us what happened?

29:25.589 --> 29:27.113
Uh, this.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.897
[game chimes]

29:28.941 --> 29:32.031
It spells out "Satan-One."

29:36.687 --> 29:38.080
Not today.

29:38.124 --> 29:41.605
It did several times last night.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.390
Really freaked out
the kids and my wife.

29:43.433 --> 29:44.478
They slept in the living room.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.393
[Charlotte screaming]

29:47.742 --> 29:50.266
-Honey, honey, w-w-what's wrong?
-It burns!

29:50.310 --> 29:51.354
It burns!

29:51.398 --> 29:52.268
-[stammers]
-What-what burns?

29:52.312 --> 29:54.488
My head.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.142
Has this happened before?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.970
She complained of her head
hurting last night.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.015
We went out
to a country western bar,

30:00.059 --> 30:02.235
a lot of really loud
honky-tonk music.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.324
-Honky-tonk?
-KRISTEN: Did you call a doctor?

30:04.367 --> 30:05.542
LI: I thought she was
having a headache.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.762
Told her to ignore it.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.243
I shouldn't have done that.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.114
KRISTEN: I think you need
to call a doctor.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.595

-My Shiba Inu

30:30.524 --> 30:31.873
is limping,

30:31.917 --> 30:35.355

30:44.190 --> 30:47.497

30:47.541 --> 30:51.023
I call on thee to enter.

ONLOOKERS:
Ave Santana.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.375
Who is he?

30:55.418 --> 30:57.638
One of my patients, Seth.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.248
KURT:
Who are all these people?

30:59.292 --> 31:02.295
Possession chasers.
They're here for a show.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.863

31:06.386 --> 31:09.128
SETH:
He's here now. He's in me.

31:09.171 --> 31:12.653
I can feel him.
I can feel his power.

31:12.696 --> 31:15.786
You've heard of rebirthing
therapy as a treatment for

31:15.830 --> 31:17.963
-reactive attachment disorder?
-Sure.

31:18.006 --> 31:21.270
Well, I do the same thing,
except with demonic therapy.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.490
The subject invites
the demonic in,

31:23.533 --> 31:25.318
and then expels it.

31:25.361 --> 31:28.495
It's often the only way
to reach the grossly reactive.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.714
[screaming]

31:32.716 --> 31:35.632
-Jesus.
-ONLOOKERS: Ave Santana.

Ave Santana. Ave Santana.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.857
I am with you.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.599
This is something else.
[chuckles] Extraordinary.

31:45.642 --> 31:48.732
No, I'll tell you what's
extraordinary: experiencing it.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.953
Being on the inside.
Not observing, being.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.085
KURT:
What do you mean?

31:53.128 --> 31:55.217
Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson,

31:55.261 --> 31:56.958
gonzo journalism.

31:57.002 --> 32:00.527
This is what your book needs.
You becoming possessed,

32:00.570 --> 32:04.009
then having the demon expelled,
then you write about it.

32:04.052 --> 32:07.012
-ONLOOKERS: Ave Santana.
-How do I do that?

32:07.055 --> 32:08.883
Ave Santana.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.238
You called?

32:21.548 --> 32:24.507
The assessment we're on, the
one with the word I gave you?

32:24.551 --> 32:26.205
-"Matters"?
-Yes.

32:26.248 --> 32:29.208
We were called to the house
of a man named Li Zhang.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.601
-Is that name familiar?
-No.

32:31.645 --> 32:34.561
His wife, Charlotte, was
supposedly possessed by a toy,

32:34.604 --> 32:36.998
but I could tell it was an act.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.000
-Okay.
-While we were observing her,

32:39.044 --> 32:42.351
assessing her,
her husband said the word

32:42.395 --> 32:43.831
"honky-tonk."

32:47.574 --> 32:49.228
It came out of nowhere.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.230
I counted 12 words after it,

32:51.273 --> 32:53.623
and the word was "ignore."

32:53.667 --> 32:55.756
He said,
"We were listening to a lot

32:55.799 --> 32:58.280
"of really loud
honky-tonk music.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.500
"I thought she was
having a headache.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.850
Told her to ignore it."

33:02.893 --> 33:05.418
I have no idea what message
you're waiting for,

33:05.461 --> 33:08.029
but I think there was a mistake
in the transmission,

33:08.073 --> 33:10.945
and this is the real message.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.555
"Ignore."

33:12.599 --> 33:15.123
Either "ignore"
what you received before,

33:15.167 --> 33:17.952
or count six letters,

33:17.996 --> 33:20.650
not seven.

33:23.566 --> 33:27.266
The message was delivered.
Your service here is complete.

33:27.309 --> 33:28.571
Sir, wait.

33:28.615 --> 33:31.879
Nobody just says "honky-tonk."

33:31.922 --> 33:34.490
Maybe this is the message.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.579
David,

33:36.623 --> 33:39.452
you have proven yourself to be
an effective intermediary,

33:39.495 --> 33:42.237
but remember,
that is all you are.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.370
You serve others,

33:44.413 --> 33:46.198
and they are satisfied.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.679
[footsteps retreating]

33:57.165 --> 33:58.949
-KRISTEN: And here we are.
-VALERIE: Wow.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.864
[Valerie laughs softly]

34:00.908 --> 34:02.997
Here. Some more onesies.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.999
You can really
never have too many.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.827
-Aw. Thank you.
-They will poop all over them.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.569
-[both laugh]
-Thank you, Kristen.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.701
You know, it's really nice
to talk to someone

34:11.745 --> 34:13.051
who's been through this before.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.400
I don't have any sisters.

34:14.443 --> 34:16.663
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine.

34:16.706 --> 34:19.753
Yeah. Though I've been
having these wild dreams.

34:19.796 --> 34:22.321
-Really?
-Yeah.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.715
Everything is engulfed
in flames, and I can't get out.

34:25.759 --> 34:28.892
I can hear my baby crying,
but I can't reach her.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.069
-Mm.
-Should I be worried?

34:31.112 --> 34:33.332
No, I had the exact same thing.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.334
With one of my pregnancies.

34:35.377 --> 34:37.162
It's a heightened level
of progesterone.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.947
Hormones. Yep, that makes sense.

34:39.990 --> 34:42.123
Actually, who I'm worried
about is Logan.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.038
He's having a hard time.

34:44.082 --> 34:47.041
[grunting]

34:47.085 --> 34:48.782
Are you tearing out
all your plants?

34:48.825 --> 34:50.871
[chuckles]

34:50.914 --> 34:53.482
Did you know hellebore
are basically lethal?

34:53.526 --> 34:55.354
So are azalea and lilies.

34:55.397 --> 34:58.531
I mean, we were growing a whole
death trap garden out here.

34:58.574 --> 35:01.403
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't
allow your baby out

35:01.447 --> 35:04.798
to graze on the plants,
but yeah, that's...

35:04.841 --> 35:07.017
It's always good to be safe.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.455
Yeah, it's the least I can do.
[chuckles]

35:09.498 --> 35:14.199
By the way, um, I can refer you
to someone if you'd like,

35:14.242 --> 35:18.246
uh, about that thing that
we spoke about, the anxiety?

35:18.290 --> 35:21.467
Oh, uh, nah, that's all right.
[sighs]

35:21.510 --> 35:25.166
I just, I-I see how much

35:25.210 --> 35:27.777
Valerie is suffering and...

35:27.821 --> 35:30.954
-how little I can do, you know?
-Yeah.

35:30.998 --> 35:34.610
Did you hear any more
of the growling

35:34.654 --> 35:36.699
-from-from Valerie?
-[chuckles] No.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.180
Uh, that's gone.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.182
-Well, that's great.
-Yeah. [laughs]

35:50.191 --> 35:52.498
Yeah, I thought you might
want to meet my boss.

But not Lynn, Laura and Lila?

35:55.327 --> 35:58.025
Well, um... Here.

35:58.068 --> 36:02.856
See, uh, you're special, Lexis.

36:02.899 --> 36:06.468
And I thought I'd take one
granddaughter at a time to work.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.601
-Do you always bring
your boss cookies?

36:08.644 --> 36:09.819
Biscuits.
Yeah, yeah, he loves them.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.039
Listen, um...
[sighs]

36:12.082 --> 36:14.041
...I want to warn you.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.043
He might not look
like you expect.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.784
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

36:17.827 --> 36:19.960
some people think
he looks a little mean

36:20.003 --> 36:23.703
and sometimes he, like,
smells a little weird.

36:23.746 --> 36:27.141
But you just have to be
friendly and smile, okay?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.926
And then we can talk
about it later.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.277
-Now you're scaring me.
-No, no, no, no.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.410
I just want you to be ready.

All right, I got five minutes.

[Sheryl clears throat]

36:48.510 --> 36:50.773
Sir, I brought
my granddaughter Lexis

36:50.817 --> 36:54.299
and, uh, we have
a present for you.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.126

Is it what I think it is?

36:56.170 --> 36:58.216
Yes. We brought you biscuits.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.654
Hello.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.917
-Lexis, was it?
-Yes, sir.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.138
Please. Help yourself.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.053
I hear so much
about you from Sheryl.

37:10.097 --> 37:13.753
She thinks you have
a great future in store for you.

37:13.796 --> 37:16.234
So, what grade are you in?

37:16.277 --> 37:18.323
-Fifth grade.
-MANAGER: Wow.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.542
Well, maybe someday
you can work here.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.544
We need bright young people.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.198
Does that sound good?

37:24.242 --> 37:27.070
It does, but I really
want to be a doctor.

37:27.114 --> 37:30.726
Well, we need more doctors
in our genetics division.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.643
Well, I should get back to work.

How many eyes does
the Manager have?

37:56.143 --> 37:59.799
-How many eyes?
-Yeah.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.714
Two. Why?

[laughs]

38:07.459 --> 38:09.417
Oof. Now what?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.724
Now you recite the prayer.

38:11.767 --> 38:14.640
"Satan, force of power,

38:14.683 --> 38:17.251
-force of enlightenment."

-Oh, shit.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.264
Okay, I think you're wrong
about Lexis.

-You tested her?
-Yeah, she didn't see him.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.051
-Not as he was.
-I'm not wrong.

38:35.095 --> 38:36.662
She just needs more
of the right influence.

It's not over yet.

I'm finished!
Do you want me to say it again?

Yes, please!
