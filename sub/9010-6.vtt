I'M THE EXPERT ON PRANKS.

00:15.584 --> 00:17.959
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:15.584 --> 00:17.959
SNAKES IN A CAN?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.083
FAKE VOMIT?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.083
FAKE VOMIT IN A CAN?

00:20.125 --> 00:21.292

00:20.125 --> 00:21.292

THAT'S AMATEUR STUFF.

00:21.334 --> 00:23.792

00:25.083 --> 00:27.250
( screaming )

00:27.292 --> 00:29.042
( laughing )

00:29.083 --> 00:31.959
CHINESE VENGEANCE GHOST.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.959
( chuckles )

00:32.000 --> 00:34.959
( growling )

00:32.000 --> 00:34.959
DID ANYONE LOSE THIS

00:32.000 --> 00:34.959
NIGHTMARE LADY--

00:35.000 --> 00:36.834
BECAUSE I THINK I FOUND IT.

00:37.542 --> 00:39.334
SKYLAR, THAT'S A PRANK.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.876
OH.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.876

00:40.918 --> 00:42.459
THIS PRANK--

00:42.500 --> 00:44.000
BECAUSE I THINK I FOUND IT.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.125
SKYLAR-- ( stammering )

00:48.167 --> 00:50.876
A PRANK IS WHEN YOU

00:48.167 --> 00:50.876
TRICK SOMEONE IN A FUNNY WAY,

00:50.918 --> 00:53.375
LIKE--LIKE PUTTING A WHOOPEE

00:50.918 --> 00:53.375
CUSHION UNDER THEIR CHAIR.

00:53.417 --> 00:54.542
( chuckling )

00:54.584 --> 00:56.500
IT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE IT

00:54.584 --> 00:56.500
SOUNDS LIKE A FART.

00:56.542 --> 00:57.542

00:57.584 --> 00:59.042
( sighs )

00:57.584 --> 00:59.042
ON MY PLANET,

00:59.083 --> 01:01.042
WE DON'T HAVE TIME

00:59.083 --> 01:01.042
FOR NONSENSE LIKE THAT.

01:01.083 --> 01:04.042
OUR GOAL IS TO HELP PEOPLE,

01:01.083 --> 01:04.042
NOT MAKE THEM LOOK STUPID.

01:04.083 --> 01:05.500

PRETTY POPULAR.

01:08.083 --> 01:11.042

01:08.083 --> 01:11.042
THE FIRST THING

01:08.083 --> 01:11.042

01:11.083 --> 01:13.042
STARTING WITH--

01:11.083 --> 01:13.042
PEEK-A-BOO!

01:13.083 --> 01:14.000

01:19.167 --> 01:20.584
NOTHING?!

01:20.626 --> 01:23.042
SORRY.

01:20.626 --> 01:23.042
ON MY PLANET,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.042
THAT IS A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

01:25.083 --> 01:27.459
THEN WHY'D YOU

01:25.083 --> 01:27.459
TRY TO KICK MY HEAD OFF?

01:27.500 --> 01:29.626
THAT'S HOW WE SAY "NO."

04:21.750 --> 04:23.042
DIDN'T I TELL  YOU?</font>

04:23.083 --> 04:25.709
I'M AN OUT-OF-SHAPE-SHIFTER.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.709

04:30.667 --> 04:34.042
OKAY, AS THE WORLD'S

04:30.667 --> 04:34.042
FOREMOST EXPERT

04:35.209 --> 04:37.667
I GIVE YOU A CRASH COURSE

04:37.709 --> 04:39.709
IN THE "ABCs" OF PRANKING.

04:39.751 --> 04:41.751
YOU SPELLED "ABCs" WRONG.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.876
A CRASH COURSE IN THE "ACBs"

04:45.918 --> 04:47.292
OF PRANKING.

04:49.334 --> 04:50.626
LET  ME </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> DO THIS.</font>

04:50.667 --> 04:53.125
I'VE BEEN PRANKING

04:50.667 --> 04:53.125
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.375
OLIVER, YOU'RE THREE DAYS

04:53.167 --> 04:55.375
OLDER THAN ME.

04:55.417 --> 04:57.334
I KNOW.

04:55.417 --> 04:57.334
I CAME OUT SIDEWAYS

04:57.375 --> 04:58.500
JUST TO MESS WITH MY MOM.

04:59.876 --> 05:02.792
NOW, KEY FACTORS IN MAKING

04:59.876 --> 05:02.792
A GOOD PRANK...

05:02.834 --> 05:04.792
ARE: HOW IT'S DONE--

05:04.834 --> 05:06.459
WHO IT'S PULLED ON--

05:06.500 --> 05:07.792
AND MOST IMPORTANT,

05:07.834 --> 05:10.042
HOW SILLY THE PERSON

05:07.834 --> 05:10.042
ENDS UP LOOKING.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.292
GOT IT!

05:11.334 --> 05:13.500
SO THE GUY

05:11.334 --> 05:13.500
WHO CUTS YOUR HAIR--

05:13.542 --> 05:15.000
HE WAS PLAYING A PRANK ON YOU?

05:16.834 --> 05:18.667
IT LOOKS BETTER

05:16.834 --> 05:18.667
AFTER A DAY OR TWO.

05:18.709 --> 05:19.709
( door opens )

05:20.834 --> 05:22.542
IT'S HORACE.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.542
PERFECT TIMING

05:22.584 --> 05:24.584
FOR AN IN-CLASS DEMONSTRATION.

05:24.626 --> 05:26.584
THE CLASSIC...

05:26.626 --> 05:28.751
WHOOPEE CUSHION GAG.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.751
( chuckles )

05:32.500 --> 05:34.042
ARE YOU PLANNING PRANKS?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.209
THIS IS A HOSPITAL,

05:34.083 --> 05:36.209
NOT A PRANK-PLANNING PLACE

05:36.250 --> 05:37.209
WHERE PRANKS ARE PULLED

05:36.250 --> 05:37.209
OR PLANNED.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.751
PLEASE!

05:39.667 --> 05:42.375
HEY, MAYBE YOU

05:39.667 --> 05:42.375
SHOULD SIT DOWN

05:42.417 --> 05:44.375
AND TELL US

05:42.417 --> 05:44.375
WHY WE SHOULDN'T PULL PRANKS.

05:47.876 --> 05:50.375
WAIT!

05:47.876 --> 05:50.375
I CAME HERE FOR A REASON.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.083
TO SIT DOWN.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.834
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.834
I'M A VERY BUSY MAN.

05:58.834 --> 06:02.542
ANYWAY, REMEMBER WHAT I SAID

05:58.834 --> 06:02.542
ABOUT NO PRANKS.

06:02.584 --> 06:05.751
TRYING TO IMPRESS A VERY

06:02.584 --> 06:05.751
IMPORTANT SUPERHERO.

06:05.792 --> 06:08.584
WHICH REMINDS ME--

06:05.792 --> 06:08.584
I NEED TO MAKE A NOTE.

06:09.876 --> 06:10.959
( breaking wind )

06:13.751 --> 06:15.709
"SEE DR. ISAAKSON

06:15.751 --> 06:18.459
ABOUT FLATULENCE PROBLEM."

06:25.459 --> 06:27.667
OKAY, SKYLAR,

06:25.459 --> 06:27.667
KAZ IS CLEARLY

06:27.709 --> 06:29.792
A ROOKIE AT PRANKING.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.459
SO LET THE "MAESTRO

06:29.834 --> 06:32.459
OF MISCHIEF"

06:32.500 --> 06:33.834
SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

06:34.834 --> 06:35.792
HEY, SOLAR FLARE,

06:35.834 --> 06:37.209
CHECK THIS OUT...

06:37.250 --> 06:39.417
I'M GONNA PRETEND TO CRACK

06:37.250 --> 06:39.417
AN EGG ON SKYLAR'S HEAD.

06:43.918 --> 06:47.292
WHY DID YOU CRACK AN EGG

06:43.918 --> 06:47.292
ON MY HEAD?!

06:48.292 --> 06:50.042
OH... ( chuckles )

06:50.083 --> 06:51.667
YOU JUST FAKED IT.

06:51.709 --> 06:53.667
YOU SHOULD SEE

06:51.709 --> 06:53.667
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.000
( laughing )

06:59.125 --> 07:01.000
( flames igniting )

07:01.042 --> 07:03.751
( Skylar and Oliver

07:01.042 --> 07:03.751
laughing )

07:03.792 --> 07:05.918
RIGHT.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.918
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.209
NOT BAD.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.209
LET THE GENIUS

07:08.250 --> 07:09.250
WITH A CAPITAL "J"

07:09.292 --> 07:10.709
SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

07:10.751 --> 07:12.542
CAPITAL "J"? REALLY?

07:13.542 --> 07:15.042
OH, I'M SORRY--

07:15.083 --> 07:17.792
GENIUS WITH A LOWERCASE "J."

07:21.542 --> 07:22.584
( chuckling )

07:26.209 --> 07:28.042
IT'S THE GREAT DEFENDER!

07:28.083 --> 07:29.751
( gasps )

07:28.083 --> 07:29.751
BIG FAN.

07:29.792 --> 07:32.000
( stammering )

07:29.792 --> 07:32.000
I LOVE YOUR POWER

07:29.792 --> 07:32.000
TO CREATE A DEFENSIVE SHIELD

07:32.042 --> 07:33.876
AND MAKE POWERS REBOUND

07:32.042 --> 07:33.876
OFF YOU.

07:33.918 --> 07:36.167
I'M REALLY GOOD AT REBOUNDING.

07:37.626 --> 07:40.417
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING OFF

07:37.626 --> 07:40.417
ON MY "FREEZE THROWS."

07:46.209 --> 07:48.751
I CAN ONLY MAKE,

07:46.209 --> 07:48.751
LIKE, FIVE OUT OF TEN.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.918
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

07:53.209 --> 07:54.667
OOH!

07:54.709 --> 07:56.751
IT'S MY LUCKY DAY!

07:58.584 --> 08:00.667
( grunting )

08:01.667 --> 08:03.000
( groans )

08:03.042 --> 08:05.000
( Skylar and Kaz laughing )

08:06.667 --> 08:08.042
HEY, DOES ANYBODY KNOW

08:08.083 --> 08:10.459
WHERE THE "CAUTION:

08:08.083 --> 08:10.459
NO FLOOR" SIGN IS?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.834
( Kaz laughing )

IS THAT YOU?

08:36.918 --> 08:38.792
IS THAT YOU?!

08:40.082 --> 08:41.792
FINE. THAT'S

08:40.082 --> 08:41.792
HOW YOU WANT IT?

08:48.584 --> 08:51.792
DARE I ASK HOW YOUR

08:48.584 --> 08:51.792
BABYSITTING'S GOING?

08:53.792 --> 08:55.542
WHERE'S THE GREAT

08:53.792 --> 08:55.542
DEFENDER'S KID?

08:55.584 --> 08:57.667
UH, WE'RE PLAYING

08:55.584 --> 08:57.667
HIDE-AND-SEEK.

08:57.709 --> 08:59.542
I'M BEING TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE,

08:59.584 --> 09:01.876
LIKE THE WORTHY,

08:59.584 --> 09:01.876
FUTURE-HOLOGRAM-WATCH-WEARING

09:01.918 --> 09:03.000
NEPHEW I AM.

09:01.918 --> 09:03.000
( chuckles )

09:04.083 --> 09:05.918
THIS GREAT DEFENDER

09:04.083 --> 09:05.918
IS  THIS </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> CLOSE</font>

09:05.959 --> 09:07.834
TO DONATING ENOUGH MONEY

09:05.959 --> 09:07.834
FOR A NEW WING.

09:07.876 --> 09:09.459
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.542
( Jamie laughing )

09:14.834 --> 09:17.042
Jamie: THIS IS HILARIOUS.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.667
( laughing )

09:19.709 --> 09:22.292
OH, SO YOU'RE THE PLASTIC CUP.

09:22.334 --> 09:23.334
YOU LITTLE BRAT.

09:25.334 --> 09:27.334
WELL, THIS IS WHERE

09:25.334 --> 09:27.334
THE TRASH BELONGS.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.000
Jamie: EW, GROSS!

09:31.042 --> 09:32.042
IT'S WET IN HERE.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.042
I CAN'T USE MY POWERS

09:32.083 --> 09:34.042
WHEN I'M WET.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.876
WELL THEN TURNING YOURSELF

09:34.083 --> 09:36.876
INTO A CUP

09:36.918 --> 09:39.000
WAS NOT THE BEST CHOICE,

09:36.918 --> 09:39.000
WAS IT?

09:39.042 --> 09:42.292
THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

09:39.042 --> 09:42.292
TO HOLD LIQUID.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.918
FINE. I'LL GET YOU A TOWEL.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.709
Jamie: NO!!!

09:54.751 --> 09:57.042
OH, NO!

09:54.751 --> 09:57.042
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

09:57.083 --> 10:00.751
PLASTIC CUPS ARE SUPPOSED

09:57.083 --> 10:00.751
TO GO IN RECYCLING, NOT GARBAGE!

10:00.792 --> 10:04.000
ALSO, I'M IN HUGE TROUBLE.

10:10.918 --> 10:12.459
GREAT PRANK, KAZ.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.751
NOW WE HAVE TO WASH

10:12.500 --> 10:14.751
THE GREAT DEFENDER'S SUIT.

10:14.792 --> 10:17.500
WAIT--DO YOU WASH

10:14.792 --> 10:17.500
INDESTRUCTIBLES IN COLD OR WARM?

10:18.459 --> 10:19.792
I'LL LOOK AT THE TAG.

10:19.834 --> 10:24.042
WHOA--HE'S

10:19.834 --> 10:24.042
AN X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X...

10:24.083 --> 10:25.709
SMALL?

10:27.083 --> 10:29.042
HE'S THE SHORTEST PERSON

10:27.083 --> 10:29.042
ON HIS PLANET.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.417
HE GETS TEASED

10:29.083 --> 10:31.417
ALL THE TIME.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.876
HEY, THIS MACHINE

10:37.500 --> 10:39.876
HAS A "SUPER-SPIN" DIAL.

10:39.918 --> 10:41.000
WE SHOULD BE DONE IN NO TIME.

10:51.876 --> 10:53.042
( groaning )

10:53.083 --> 10:54.042
( whimpering )

10:54.083 --> 10:56.042
WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS DONE?!

10:56.083 --> 10:58.709
THE POWER

10:56.083 --> 10:58.709
OF THE SUPER-SPIN CYCLE

10:58.751 --> 11:00.667
IS CONNECTED

10:58.751 --> 11:00.667
TO THE EARTH'S CORE.

11:00.709 --> 11:03.042
EVERYONE </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> KNOWS THAT.</font>

11:03.083 --> 11:04.876
WELL WHY AREN'T YOU

11:03.083 --> 11:04.876
AFFECTED?

11:04.918 --> 11:06.542
I GOT A LOT OF TRACTION.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.375
HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE

11:06.584 --> 11:08.375
OF MY FEET?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.042
OKAY, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

11:11.083 --> 11:12.709
WE'RE ALL DOOMED!

11:12.751 --> 11:14.876
( all screaming )

11:14.918 --> 11:16.042
HA!

11:16.083 --> 11:18.459
I PRANKED YA BACK, KAZ!

11:18.500 --> 11:19.542
( laughing )

11:19.584 --> 11:21.918
THE SUPER-SPIN CYCLE

11:19.584 --> 11:21.918
DIDN'T DO THIS.

11:21.959 --> 11:23.083
I DID.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.542
W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:25.584 --> 11:26.751
I SPUN THE EARTH ON MY FINGER.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.375
LIKE THIS...

11:29.876 --> 11:32.042
BUT BIGGER...

11:29.876 --> 11:32.042
'CAUSE IT'S THE EARTH.

11:33.542 --> 11:35.167
THAT IS  AWESOME.</font>

11:35.209 --> 11:38.709
BUT...THE HYPER-ROTATION

11:35.209 --> 11:38.709
WILL RIP THE EARTH APART!

11:38.751 --> 11:40.751
NOT AS AWESOME!

11:41.834 --> 11:43.834
DON'T WORRY.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.834
I'LL JUST SPIN THE EARTH

11:43.876 --> 11:44.709
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

11:47.751 --> 11:50.042
OH, NO--MY POWERS.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.834
THE--THEY'RE NOT WORKING.

11:51.876 --> 11:53.834
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

11:51.876 --> 11:53.834
IN THE HOSPITAL.

11:53.876 --> 11:55.918
IF YOU CAN'T FIX IT,

11:53.876 --> 11:55.918
WHAT'LL HAPPEN?

11:55.959 --> 11:58.709
THE PLANET WILL SPIN

11:55.959 --> 11:58.709
INTO THE SUN,

11:58.751 --> 12:01.959
DESTROYING THE EARTH

11:58.751 --> 12:01.959
AND EVERYTHING ON IT.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.042
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

12:02.000 --> 12:04.042
FOR PRANKING ME, KAZ.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.834
THIS IS ALL...YOUR...FAULT.

12:09.709 --> 12:13.167
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE

12:09.709 --> 12:13.167
WON'T BE ANY SCHOOL TOMORROW.

12:13.209 --> 12:14.751
OR EVER.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.042
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.042
THE WORLD'S GONNA END.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.000
AND I JUST GOT THESE

12:24.083 --> 12:26.000
NEW JEANS.

12:27.584 --> 12:30.000
TALK ABOUT BAD TIMING, HUH?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.500
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:33.542 --> 12:35.167
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM, KAZ?

12:35.209 --> 12:36.834
THE TRUTH IS...

12:38.083 --> 12:39.626
HE DID IT. AAH!

12:42.000 --> 12:43.834
THE GREAT DEFENDER

12:42.000 --> 12:43.834
MADE THE EARTH SPIN FASTER.

12:43.876 --> 12:45.042
NOW WE CAN'T GET IT TO STOP.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.209
THEY </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> PRANKED ME FIRST!</font>

12:47.250 --> 12:49.042
THEY GOT MY SUIT ALL DIRTY.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.167
THE ONLY OTHER UNIFORM

12:49.083 --> 12:51.167
THEY HAVE FOR ME TO WEAR

12:51.209 --> 12:52.542
IS THIS...

12:57.083 --> 13:00.167
I WARNED YOU KIDS

12:57.083 --> 13:00.167
ABOUT PULLING PRANKS!

13:00.209 --> 13:02.834
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO PRANK

13:00.209 --> 13:02.834
THE GREAT DEFENDER, KAZ?

13:02.876 --> 13:04.042
( sighs )

13:02.876 --> 13:04.042
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST ADMIT

13:04.083 --> 13:05.042
THAT I'M BETTER AT PRANKS

13:04.083 --> 13:05.042
THAN YOU--

13:05.083 --> 13:07.626
THAT I'M THE "GOVERNOR

13:05.083 --> 13:07.626
OF GIGGLES"?

13:08.792 --> 13:10.876
"GOVERNOR OF GIGGLES"?

13:10.918 --> 13:13.000
SHOULD I HAVE GONE

13:10.918 --> 13:13.000
WITH "SULTAN OF SILLINESS"?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.292
THE "CITY COUNCILMAN

13:13.042 --> 13:14.292
OF COMEDY"?

13:14.334 --> 13:15.667
ARE YOU FINISHED?!

13:15.709 --> 13:16.709
NO.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.042
THE "WARLORD OF WACKINESS"?

13:18.083 --> 13:19.542
NOW I'M FINISHED.

13:22.334 --> 13:23.834
( panting )

13:23.876 --> 13:26.918
WHY IS THE GRAVITY

13:23.876 --> 13:26.918
PULLING SO...

13:26.959 --> 13:28.083
HARD?!

13:31.709 --> 13:32.876
( panting )

13:32.918 --> 13:34.584
EW.

13:35.959 --> 13:37.667
JAMIE, ARE YOU IN HERE?

13:37.709 --> 13:39.250
Jamie: UH-HUH.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.250
I'M SCARED.

13:39.292 --> 13:40.918
HOLD UP YOUR HANDS.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.584
I DON'T HAVE HANDS!

13:42.626 --> 13:43.751
I'M A CUP!

13:43.792 --> 13:46.000
DON'T WORRY.

13:43.792 --> 13:46.000
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.918
OH, NO.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.918
WHAT?

13:51.918 --> 13:55.000
I GAVE THIS TO MY UNCLE HORACE

13:51.918 --> 13:55.000
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.792
HE SAID HE LOVED IT.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.042
COULD THIS DAY

13:56.834 --> 13:59.042
GET ANY WORSE?

13:59.083 --> 14:01.000
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

13:59.083 --> 14:01.000
WE'LL FIND OUT

14:01.042 --> 14:03.334
THIS GARBAGE IS ABOUT

14:01.042 --> 14:03.334
TO BE DESTROYED

14:01.042 --> 14:03.334
BY A DISINTEGRATION RAY.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.042
( alarm buzzing )

14:05.083 --> 14:06.834
Male Computerized Voice:

14:05.083 --> 14:06.834
WARNING--DISINTEGRATION RAY</font>

14:06.876 --> 14:08.000
COMMENCING IN FIVE MINUTES.</font>

14:11.751 --> 14:14.125
HORACE, THERE'S GOTTA

14:11.751 --> 14:14.125
BE  SOMETHING </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> THAT WE CAN DO.</font>

14:14.167 --> 14:17.709
WELL-- ( grunts )

14:14.167 --> 14:17.709
I CAN ACTIVATE THE HOSPITAL'S

14:14.167 --> 14:17.709
MOTION STABILIZER.

14:17.751 --> 14:18.751
( grunts )

14:22.792 --> 14:25.751
BUT EARTH IS STILL

14:22.792 --> 14:25.751
HURTLING TOWARD THE SUN--

14:25.792 --> 14:28.042
WHICH MEANS WE'LL

14:25.792 --> 14:28.042
BE EXPERIENCING UNBEARABLE HEAT

14:28.083 --> 14:29.751
AND GEYSERS OF STEAM.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.918
I'M SO TORN--

14:32.959 --> 14:35.792
I LOVE BEING RIGHT,

14:32.959 --> 14:35.792
BUT I HATE BEING HOT.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.918
KAZ, WE NEED TO THINK.

14:38.959 --> 14:40.959
( sighs )

14:38.959 --> 14:40.959
IF ONLY SKYLAR

14:38.959 --> 14:40.959
STILL HAD HER POWER

14:41.000 --> 14:42.083
TO REVERSE TIME.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.000
OR HER POWER TO CONTROL

14:42.125 --> 14:44.000
CELESTIAL BODIES.

14:44.042 --> 14:45.167
OR HER POWER

14:44.042 --> 14:45.167
TO ALTER GRAVITY--

14:45.209 --> 14:48.000
I GET IT!

14:45.209 --> 14:48.000
I USED TO BE REALLY COOL!

14:49.375 --> 14:52.042
WAIT--THERE IS ONE WAY

14:52.083 --> 14:53.209
TO SAVE US.

14:53.250 --> 14:56.042
MIGHTY MED HAS A SMALL,

14:53.250 --> 14:56.042
TWO-PERSON ROCKET.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.792
YOU BOYS COULD PILOT

14:56.083 --> 14:58.792
THAT ROCKET INTO SPACE

14:58.834 --> 15:00.918
AND USE ITS DEFLECTOR SHIELD

15:00.959 --> 15:02.876
TO NUDGE THE EARTH

15:00.959 --> 15:02.876
BACK INTO ORBIT.

15:02.918 --> 15:05.500
WHY US? AREN'T THERE

15:02.918 --> 15:05.500
ANY SUPERHEROES WHO COULD DO IT?

15:05.542 --> 15:07.209
NO! THE ROCKET'S CONTROLS

15:07.250 --> 15:09.083
REQUIRE THE MINDLESS,

15:07.250 --> 15:09.083
REPETITIVE MOTION

15:09.125 --> 15:11.042
THAT YOU TWO HAVE MASTERED

15:09.125 --> 15:11.042
WASTING YOUR LIVES

15:11.083 --> 15:12.250
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES!

15:13.209 --> 15:15.042
WELL, I AM THE "VICEROY

15:13.209 --> 15:15.042
OF VIDEO GAMES."

15:15.083 --> 15:18.959
PLEASE STOP.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.959
I AM BEGGING YOU.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.834
OKAY. HORACE,

15:21.250 --> 15:23.834
COUNT US IN.

15:23.876 --> 15:26.083
GOOD. BUT BEFORE WE

15:23.876 --> 15:26.083
LAUNCH YOU INTO SPACE,

15:26.125 --> 15:28.250
THERE'S ONE VERY IMPORTANT

15:26.125 --> 15:28.250
THING I NEED TO TELL YOU.

15:28.292 --> 15:29.375
WHAT IS IT?

15:29.417 --> 15:32.000
THOSE JEANS ARE NOT

15:29.417 --> 15:32.000
DOING YOU ANY FAVORS.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.834
Jamie: HURRY!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.834
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME!

15:36.876 --> 15:38.459
OH, REALLY?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.918
BECAUSE  I </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> THOUGHT WE HAD</font>

15:38.500 --> 15:40.918
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

15:40.959 --> 15:43.209
IN FACT, I WAS JUST ABOUT

15:40.959 --> 15:43.209
TO ASK THE COMPUTER

15:43.250 --> 15:44.459
TO CUT THE COUNTDOWN TIME

15:43.250 --> 15:44.459
IN HALF.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.918
( alarm buzzing )

15:45.959 --> 15:46.918
Computerized Voice:

15:45.959 --> 15:46.918
COMMAND ACCEPTED.</font>

15:46.959 --> 15:48.334
COUNTDOWN TIME</font>

15:46.959 --> 15:48.334
CUT IN HALF.</font>

15:48.375 --> 15:50.042
DISINTEGRATION IN ONE MINUTE.</font>

15:50.083 --> 15:52.042
NO! I WAS JUST

15:50.083 --> 15:52.042
BEING SARCASTIC!

15:52.083 --> 15:54.042
AND HOW'S THAT</font>

15:52.083 --> 15:54.042
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?</font>

15:54.083 --> 15:56.000
( beeping )

15:57.042 --> 15:58.417
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

15:58.459 --> 16:01.125
I'M SORRY I THREW YOU

15:58.459 --> 16:01.125
IN THE TRASH!

16:01.167 --> 16:02.876
Jamie: AND I'M SORRY

16:01.167 --> 16:02.876
I PLAYED A TRICK ON YOU!

16:02.918 --> 16:04.459
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.042
NO ONE'S LEAVING YOU--

16:06.083 --> 16:07.834
NOT ON MY WATCH.

16:07.876 --> 16:10.042
LITERALLY--I'VE GOT A VISITECH

16:07.876 --> 16:10.042
HOLOGRAM WATCH

16:10.083 --> 16:11.292
RIDING ON THIS.

16:11.334 --> 16:12.375
( inhales deeply )

16:16.959 --> 16:20.250
Jamie: YES!

16:16.959 --> 16:20.250
YOU SAVED ME!

16:20.292 --> 16:23.125
( sighs )

16:20.292 --> 16:23.125
WELL, COULD YOU PULL YOUR

16:20.292 --> 16:23.125
FINGERS OUT OF MY NOSE?

16:23.167 --> 16:25.000
OH, SORRY.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.959
LET ME DRY YOU OFF.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.250
YOU'RE MY HERO!

16:38.292 --> 16:40.459
UH--I-I AM?

16:41.584 --> 16:43.167
WOW.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.167
( chuckles )

16:43.209 --> 16:46.125
NO ONE'S EVER CALLED ME

16:43.209 --> 16:46.125
A HERO BEFORE.

16:46.167 --> 16:49.125
YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER

16:46.167 --> 16:49.125
WANT TO COME BACK TO MIGHTY MED,

16:49.167 --> 16:51.167
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY

16:49.167 --> 16:51.167
TO BABYSIT YOU.

16:51.209 --> 16:52.918
THAT'S SWEET AND ALL,

16:52.959 --> 16:55.876
BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO BE

16:52.959 --> 16:55.876
DISINTEGRATED. SO...

16:55.918 --> 16:57.042
COULD YOU MAYBE

16:55.918 --> 16:57.042
GET US OUT OF HERE?

16:57.083 --> 16:58.000
OH, RIGHT!

17:05.083 --> 17:07.083
THE LAUNCH PAD

17:05.083 --> 17:07.083
IS BENEATH THE TRAINING DECK.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.291
WE'LL LOWER YOU

17:07.125 --> 17:09.291
INTO THE CAPSULE.

17:09.334 --> 17:11.125
OH--ONE SMALL DETAIL--

17:11.166 --> 17:13.041
THE IMPACT

17:11.166 --> 17:13.041
FROM THE DEFLECTOR SHIELDS

17:13.083 --> 17:14.416
WILL DESTROY THE ROCKET,

17:13.083 --> 17:14.416
SO YOU'LL NEED

17:14.459 --> 17:16.166
TO EJECT YOURSELVES

17:14.459 --> 17:16.166
INTO SPACE.

17:16.209 --> 17:20.041
HOW MANY DAYS CAN NORMOS

17:16.209 --> 17:20.041
SURVIVE WITHOUT OXYGEN?

17:20.083 --> 17:21.041
ZERO!

17:21.083 --> 17:22.917
ZERO DAYS!

17:24.083 --> 17:26.041
FORGET IT.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.041
THERE'S NO WAY

17:24.083 --> 17:26.041
WE'RE DOING THAT.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.041
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.334
NO PROBLEM.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.918
THE WORLD AND EVERYONE ON IT

17:29.375 --> 17:31.918
CAN GET DESTROYED,

17:31.959 --> 17:35.000
BUT WE ALL REALLY ENJOYED

17:31.959 --> 17:35.000
YOUR LITTLE PRANK DAY.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.375
KAZ...

17:37.417 --> 17:38.918
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.042
I--

17:41.083 --> 17:43.959
WE'RE THE ONLY HOPE

17:41.083 --> 17:43.959
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

17:44.042 --> 17:46.042
WAIT! DON'T SEND THEM!

17:46.083 --> 17:48.042
IT REALLY SHOULD

17:46.083 --> 17:48.042
BE ME GOING UP THERE.

17:48.083 --> 17:51.042
WOW, THAT IS SO LIKE YOU--

17:51.083 --> 17:53.542
SACRIFICING YOURSELF

17:51.083 --> 17:53.542
TO SAVE US.

17:53.584 --> 17:56.876
THE TRUTH IS, I REALLY DON'T

17:53.584 --> 17:56.876
TRUST YOU GUYS TO DO IT RIGHT.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.959
YOU CAN'T GO.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.959
THEY'RE ALREADY SUITED UP,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.959
AND WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.959
MOVE OUT, BOYS!

18:02.667 --> 18:04.042
HEY, O-OLIVER.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.125
OLIVER, BEFORE WE GO,

18:05.167 --> 18:06.959
I HAVE A CONFESSION.

18:08.042 --> 18:10.459
Y-YOU ARE BETTER AT PRANKS

18:08.042 --> 18:10.459
THAN I AM.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.042
YOU ARE THE--

18:12.083 --> 18:14.459
THE "GOVERNOR OF GIGGLES."

18:12.083 --> 18:14.459
( chuckles )

18:14.500 --> 18:17.209
BUT YOU'RE ALSO

18:14.500 --> 18:17.209
THE "NINCOMPOOP OF NICKNAMES."

18:18.334 --> 18:19.417
THANKS,

18:20.417 --> 18:21.959
"TUNA KAZ-EROLE."

18:23.000 --> 18:25.500
WOW, I  AM </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> REALLY BAD</font>

18:23.000 --> 18:25.500
AT NICKNAMES.

18:26.626 --> 18:27.959
AND LISTEN--

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
THESE ARE OUR LAST

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
FEW MOMENTS ALIVE...

18:31.083 --> 18:32.667
I'M GLAD I'M SPENDING 'EM

18:31.083 --> 18:32.667
WITH YOU.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.167
ME, TOO, MAN.

18:35.292 --> 18:38.167
Y-YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND

18:35.292 --> 18:38.167
I COULD EVER HAVE.

18:38.209 --> 18:40.083
( sighs )

18:38.209 --> 18:40.083
I LOVE YOU.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.000
LOVE YOU, TOO, BUDDY.

18:45.584 --> 18:47.000
AND I LOVE YOU BOTH...

18:47.042 --> 18:48.334
FOR LETTING ME WITNESS

18:48.375 --> 18:51.667
SUCH A HILARIOUSLY

18:48.375 --> 18:51.667
SAPPY MOMENT.

18:51.709 --> 18:52.959
( laughing )

18:55.042 --> 18:56.167
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:56.209 --> 18:59.042
PSYCH! THE EARTH'S

18:56.209 --> 18:59.042
NOT SPEEDING TOWARD THE SUN!

18:59.083 --> 19:00.709
IT WAS ALL FAKE!

19:00.751 --> 19:02.042
T-THERE'S NO ROCKET.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.042
THERE'S NO POSITRONIC REACTOR.

19:04.083 --> 19:06.709
THERE'S NO LAUNCH PAD

19:04.083 --> 19:06.709
UNDER HERE.

19:06.751 --> 19:07.667
THERE'S A GRAVEYARD.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.000
TH-THIS WAS ALL A PRANK?

19:11.042 --> 19:12.459
( scoffs )

19:11.042 --> 19:12.459
YEP.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.042
NOW  THAT'S </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> HOW YOU</font>

19:12.500 --> 19:15.042
PULL A PRACTICAL JOKE.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.167
YOU WERE IN ON THIS?

19:16.209 --> 19:17.500
NO!

19:17.542 --> 19:19.209
IT WAS ALL MY IDEA!

19:19.250 --> 19:20.709
( laughing )

19:20.751 --> 19:23.584
AND THE STUDENT

19:20.751 --> 19:23.584
HAS BECOME...THE MASTER.

19:23.626 --> 19:25.167
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:25.209 --> 19:27.042
W-WHAT ABOUT ALL THE--

19:25.209 --> 19:27.042
THE HEAT,

19:27.083 --> 19:28.125
AND THE--AND THE QUAKING,

19:28.167 --> 19:29.459
AND THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE?

19:29.500 --> 19:31.667
THE GREAT DEFENDER

19:29.500 --> 19:31.667
WAS IN ON THE WHOLE THING.

19:31.709 --> 19:33.542
HE WASN'T SPINNING THE EARTH

19:31.709 --> 19:33.542
ON HIS FINGER.

19:33.584 --> 19:35.250
THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.

19:35.292 --> 19:38.500
HE WAS ONLY SPINNING

19:35.292 --> 19:38.500
THE HOSPITAL ON HIS FINGER.

19:38.542 --> 19:39.584
LIKE THIS...

19:41.167 --> 19:44.083
BUT ONLY BIGGER

19:41.167 --> 19:44.083
'CAUSE IT'S A HOSPITAL.

19:45.626 --> 19:48.292
AND SOLAR FLARE

19:45.626 --> 19:48.292
CREATED THE HEAT SURGE.

19:51.584 --> 19:53.167
I FEEL SO STUPID.

19:53.209 --> 19:55.292
DON'T. THE DANGER WAS FAKE,

19:55.334 --> 19:58.000
BUT YOUR BRAVERY

19:55.334 --> 19:58.000
WAS REAL.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.125
I COMMEND YOU BOTH.

20:00.167 --> 20:01.167
I DON'T.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.459
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR FACES.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.375
OOH--"OH, I LOVE YOU, MAN."

20:06.417 --> 20:08.417
( imitating crying )

20:09.834 --> 20:11.584
WE DON'T HAVE TO STAND HERE

20:09.834 --> 20:11.584
AND TAKE THIS.

20:11.626 --> 20:13.000
NO, WE DON'T.

20:16.083 --> 20:17.209

20:38.709 --> 20:42.667
THE GREAT DEFENDER'S KID.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.500
I...JUST DID.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.042

THEN WHO HAVE I BEEN

20:51.083 --> 20:53.542

WHY WERE YOU WATCHING HER?

20:58.459 --> 20:59.667
WHAT?!

20:59.709 --> 21:03.334
SO I SAVED THIS KID'S LIVE

20:59.709 --> 21:03.334
FOR NOTHING?!

GET ANYTHING IN RETURN?
