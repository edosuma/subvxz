WEBVTT

00:48.448 --> 00:51.008
- Okay, left knee?
- Left knee.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.259
All right, you can relax.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.902
The purpose of exit physicals
is not to talk about your right knee.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.730
The purpose of exit physicals

01:10.937 --> 01:12.769
is to see if there's anything
we need to do over the summer.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.100
- Overall health.
- Overall health.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.332
Shoulders, elbows...

01:16.543 --> 01:18.910
Uh, earlier this year I saw you wearing
something on your elbow. Is that all right?

01:19.112 --> 01:22.105
Actually, I do have a little
tendinitis in my left elbow.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.442
So, let me ask you
a different way.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.710
Is there any part of you that's okay?

01:26.820 --> 01:28.220
Because we're talking
about the shoulder,

01:28.421 --> 01:29.684
the elbow, the ankles, the knees.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.448
Is there any part that's okay?

01:32.792 --> 01:33.792
Your back's good?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.622
- My back was really good this year.
- All right, good.

01:35.829 --> 01:36.956
Look, I think that
that's part of the deal.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.029
I mean, you've been playing
basketball for what? 20 years?

01:40.233 --> 01:42.293
What am I now? 35 almost!

02:58.478 --> 03:01.209
Five... six...

03:03.683 --> 03:05.015
One more.

03:06.553 --> 03:07.851
Six...

03:12.392 --> 03:13.860
Seven...

03:15.028 --> 03:18.055
eight... nine, one more.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.994
Two...

03:25.038 --> 03:26.336
Yes!

04:12.385 --> 04:13.683
Hu! Hu!

04:22.662 --> 04:25.632
Mavs time, game time. Let's go!

04:36.909 --> 04:40.141
Are... you... ready?!

05:31.631 --> 05:32.792
Last one, baby. Defense.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.865
- One, two, three!
- Defense!

05:56.322 --> 05:57.517
When he gets in that zone

05:57.724 --> 06:00.023
he thinks every shot's
going to go in, and,

06:00.259 --> 06:01.989
he has that talent,

06:02.195 --> 06:05.222
along with the dedication
to be one of the best players.

06:05.431 --> 06:09.732
It's tough to defend
and it's a great thing to watch.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.468
Of course, he has
a very high basketball IQ.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.339
He knows where to find a shot,
when he should sprint,

06:19.579 --> 06:22.048
when he should slow down
and where to find teammates.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.649
He really gets
his team together well.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.183
A good leader.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.484
His ball handling,
his passing...

06:34.560 --> 06:38.930
I think the biggest thing
that he added to the game,

06:40.066 --> 06:41.534
was his post up play.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.366
His ability to post up
and, you know, and operate

06:44.570 --> 06:46.198
from those positions
on the floor

06:46.406 --> 06:50.434
is what I think, you know, really
separated him from everybody else.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.348
And it's amazing. Knowing
him, you're like, "Man, how did he...

06:57.550 --> 06:58.745
How is he able to do that?"

06:58.985 --> 07:01.352
Because sometimes he walks in
rather stiff before the game

07:01.554 --> 07:03.785
and you're like, "There's no way he's
going to be able to play tonight."

07:03.990 --> 07:05.788
And he goes out there...
He'll drop 30, 40 points,

07:05.992 --> 07:07.290
and it looks easy.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.027
Ten-time All-Star,
League MVP, Finals MVP.

07:15.234 --> 07:19.035
There's only a handful of guys
that have done it: Bird, Jordan,

07:19.238 --> 07:22.208
Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson,
you know.

07:22.408 --> 07:25.640
And there's six or seven others,
and Dirk, and that's it.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.284
When he arrived in the States

07:31.484 --> 07:33.953
and I had a chance
to see him practice

07:34.153 --> 07:36.315
it was clear that somebody
had been working with him.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.253
This is not some really athletic kid

07:39.459 --> 07:41.655
that didn't have any development.

07:41.861 --> 07:45.127
Uh, and pretty short
into it I realized

07:45.331 --> 07:48.733
that he was not just developed by
just an average coach out there,

07:48.935 --> 07:51.734
that this was a coach
with an extremely high IQ,

07:51.938 --> 07:55.466
with a very specific style
of development.

08:44.490 --> 08:48.154
This is the
Institute for Applied Nonsense.

08:49.328 --> 08:53.527
The name came about when
we started training with Dirk,

08:53.733 --> 08:56.202
because all the methods we used

08:56.402 --> 08:59.497
were called plain nonsense.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.140
We didn't feel
like contradicting,

09:02.341 --> 09:05.072
so we made it an institute
for applied nonsense.

09:05.778 --> 09:09.408
That's where the name comes from.

09:10.216 --> 09:14.017
I studied Math and Physics,
so I've always been accused of

09:14.220 --> 09:18.555
considering myself
the Einstein of basketball.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.494
That's why we put his picture on it.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.554
And since the Americans
thought it was so funny,

09:26.599 --> 09:27.760
there's an English version.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.333
"For Applied Nonsense."

10:24.090 --> 10:26.582
Their
relationship is a very unique one.

10:26.792 --> 10:32.732
It's like the mad scientist
and Frankenstein, I guess.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.604
I could remember
watching some of their workouts

10:42.808 --> 10:44.276
early in Dirk's career,

10:44.844 --> 10:47.143
and I just didn't understand
what they were doing.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.474
Uh, why they were doing it.

10:49.682 --> 10:53.084
But once you get to talk
to Holger and Dirk

10:53.285 --> 10:57.416
and understand the importance
of each move they do,

10:57.623 --> 11:00.923
each breathing technique
they do, you understood it.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.773
I get it.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.672
Yeah, but in one step,
so your weight is already here.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.281
They sort of have this relationship

11:23.482 --> 11:26.975
where they understand each other
without even talking to each other.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.620
There's many times when
I've asked Dirk

11:28.821 --> 11:31.985
What is... You know, for example
"When is Holger arriving?"

11:32.191 --> 11:34.820
Or, "When is Holger leaving?"
And he has no idea.

11:35.561 --> 11:39.498
And, uh... Just, kind of,
you know, simple questions

11:39.699 --> 11:42.965
that he just
doesn't have any idea of.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.000
But they sort of know each other.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.797
I don't know.
It's just this kind of...

11:47.239 --> 11:49.367
We call it in Swedish "telepati."

11:49.575 --> 11:52.409
I don't know,
maybe they have their own language.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.410
I don't know.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.686
Oh my God!

12:07.927 --> 12:12.194
I think anyone who wants to play
at the top and with the best

12:12.465 --> 12:14.525
has definitely put the work in.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.235
There's no other way.

12:16.635 --> 12:19.161
They say about Kobe Bryant,
for example,

12:19.872 --> 12:22.706
that he's the biggest work horse.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.376
Some people
who have played with him say

12:29.048 --> 12:30.846
that if he has a bad game,

12:31.250 --> 12:35.415
and they fly to the next city,
he's picked up by car

12:35.921 --> 12:38.356
and they have to find him
a gym that night.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.024
And he goes there
at 2 or 3 a.m., shoots hoops

12:42.661 --> 12:45.426
to regain his rhythm,
and then he goes to bed.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.528
Yeah, it's very important.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.726
You have to have the work ethic.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.072
You have to be willing
to push yourself.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.471
And, you know, not be satisfied
with where you are.

12:57.743 --> 13:02.647
You know, a lot of times
people get caught up in,

13:02.848 --> 13:05.044
"Well, I'll do it tomorrow."

13:05.651 --> 13:08.314
"I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll do it tomorrow."

13:08.621 --> 13:11.591
You got to do it now.
You got to work now.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.417
So that tomorrow is much better.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.119
And Dirk has that work ethic,
he has that quality.

13:17.363 --> 13:18.456
I do as well.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.681
He was discovered by Geschwindner.

13:38.184 --> 13:42.645
He played with his team in
Schweinfurt, like Geschwindner.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.016
That's where he noticed Dirk.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.251
I think he was fourteen,
fourteen-and-a-half.

13:48.527 --> 13:52.089
We were watching
the kids from the sidelines,

13:52.298 --> 13:54.961
and there was this really tall kid.

13:55.167 --> 13:59.935
What surprised me was that he did
everything a good player should do,

14:00.472 --> 14:04.876
without having
any advanced technical skills.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.846
He was always in the right spot,

14:08.047 --> 14:10.107
not just chasing the ball
like other kids.

14:10.316 --> 14:13.548
Just for fun I asked,
"Who's training you?"

14:13.752 --> 14:16.051
"No one," he said.
Well then.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.223
I hadn't trained
with anyone before,

14:24.830 --> 14:27.163
it was just about the chemistry,

14:27.366 --> 14:31.633
and that quickly worked out.
We agreed on most things.

14:31.871 --> 14:37.310
He showed me his room
in his parents' basement.

14:38.177 --> 14:42.239
Posters of Scottie Pippen
and so on... This kid was serious.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.384
All right, then,
let's give it a shot!

14:55.728 --> 14:59.824
It would be easy to
say it's a father-son relationship.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.396
Actually that's probably
not what it is.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.728
It's more of an...

15:06.138 --> 15:08.869
...apprentice-master craftsman
relationship.

15:15.314 --> 15:18.443
It's one of those great
sets of circumstances:

15:18.751 --> 15:21.414
There's this direct relationship,

15:22.421 --> 15:23.855
an absolutely direct one,

15:24.056 --> 15:26.719
a straight line between two points

15:27.092 --> 15:31.689
running from the invention
of basketball to Dirk Nowitzki.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.317
There was
a teacher named Naismith,

15:54.520 --> 15:56.284
and he invented basketball

15:56.488 --> 16:00.482
by nailing peach baskets
to the wall.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.928
The game spread
quickly in America

16:04.129 --> 16:06.462
and soon became
an Olympic discipline.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.328
That was in 1936, in Berlin.

16:09.535 --> 16:13.063
So the organizer
of the Olympic Games in Berlin

16:13.272 --> 16:18.006
sent an envoy
to Naismith in America.

16:18.344 --> 16:23.180
That envoy, a man named Clausen,
came back to Berlin

16:23.382 --> 16:27.149
infected with the basketball bug.
He was fascinated.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.951
Later Clausen became

16:35.160 --> 16:39.655
a teacher at Holger
Geschwindner's high school,

16:39.965 --> 16:43.800
and trained Holger Geschwindner
as a player.

16:47.706 --> 16:51.802
Holger Geschwindner,
injured himself in that last move.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.976
Butler, a teacher
at Giessen's American school.

16:58.017 --> 17:03.456
Butler became the first
American player in Germany.

17:03.655 --> 17:07.683
And Holger Geschwindner,
having been trained by Clausen,

17:07.992 --> 17:12.192
came to a game in Giessen,
a junior team game.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.526
And the guy scores 100 points.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.827
You know. And you say, "What?"

17:20.539 --> 17:22.838
At that time I'd only heard
of one other person

17:23.041 --> 17:25.136
ever scoring 100 points in a game.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.571
And that was Wilt Chamberlain.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.973
You know. And you're saying, "What?

17:28.213 --> 17:31.706
We're going to question
bringing this guy to the team!

17:31.917 --> 17:33.647
I mean, come on!

17:34.186 --> 17:35.984
Middle of the first half,

17:36.188 --> 17:38.157
Giessen led by nine points,

17:38.357 --> 17:42.692
but MTV Giessen came back
at the end of the first half,

17:42.895 --> 17:45.091
particularly thanks
to the performance

17:45.297 --> 17:47.994
of national player
Holger Geschwindner.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.035
The next year
we were German Champions.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.761
That's how it started.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.600
Everything
I would do he would do it better.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.869
He picked up everything so fast.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.107
So our relationship
got tighter and tighter

18:01.313 --> 18:03.782
and I would drive him home a lot.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.676
Ernest noticed
this talented young player

18:05.918 --> 18:07.386
and took an interest in him:

18:07.786 --> 18:12.281
Holger's success is in no
small part thanks to Ernest,

18:12.558 --> 18:13.958
who supported him.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.388
So Holger considered it
his obvious duty

18:17.596 --> 18:20.896
to do the very same thing,
should the opportunity arise.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.394
After practice
we'd always go and have a beer.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.595
So I'd be in a talkative mood.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.907
I'd philosophize and he'd be
picking that stuff up.

18:31.110 --> 18:35.639
And I said a couple times, "Now you
know, Holger, basketball is jazz.

18:35.848 --> 18:39.114
Basketball is jazz,
it's the same thing."

18:39.318 --> 18:41.583
I think that
just really sunk in to him.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.154
So it's been going on
for 50 years now.

18:44.356 --> 18:48.418
Fifty years we've been talking about
how we can clarify that more.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.733
That's the basic idea.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.027
It just rang in my head
that there's something about

19:23.795 --> 19:28.631
not just doing it, but doing it
with a little extra flair.

19:28.867 --> 19:33.703
With a little something special.
A little spice on it.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.341
And now that's common.

19:37.309 --> 19:41.542
I mean Dirk does things,
back in those days you'd say, "Whoa!"

19:41.747 --> 19:45.275
That one-foot thing he does
where he's falling backwards...

19:53.992 --> 19:58.327
And I think a lot of that comes
from Holger's imagination.

19:58.530 --> 20:02.797
He thinks outside the box.
That's the way he played.

20:03.001 --> 20:06.130
And that's the connection I see
between that and jazz.

20:06.338 --> 20:10.673
If you are thinking in the box
it can still be jazz

20:10.876 --> 20:13.812
but it doesn't have
that creative little ting to it

20:14.012 --> 20:17.471
that you get when you find guys
that are trying new things

20:17.683 --> 20:21.711
and always putting spice on it,
if that makes any sense.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.251
My wife watches every game.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.895
But she can't handle
the tension at night.

21:04.129 --> 21:07.896
And if anything happens
to her boy, she gets extra mad.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.061
So it's better she enjoys all the
games in the afternoon reruns.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.208
Just seeing him!
We miss him.

21:16.908 --> 21:20.242
Of course.
Just seeing him up there,

21:20.846 --> 21:22.906
playing at that level,

21:23.515 --> 21:24.881
it makes you proud.

21:36.261 --> 21:39.720
There certainly are
parents of athletes

21:39.931 --> 21:44.460
who appropriate their children's
fame and are omnipresent,

21:44.670 --> 21:49.472
assuming responsibilities or
completely overhauling their lives.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.768
That's not true of the Nowitzki
family. Quite the contrary.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.814
They didn't buy a new house.
And other than perhaps a new car,

21:58.150 --> 22:03.782
their lives are still stuck
in the mid-80s, so to speak.

22:04.022 --> 22:08.426
And I think it's fantastic that the
MVP trophy that's here in Würzburg

22:08.994 --> 22:13.796
stands behind the
handball trophy of Dirk's dad.

22:14.299 --> 22:17.963
I believe he was Bavarian
Handball Player of the Year,

22:18.170 --> 22:20.196
and that trophy
is in front of the MVP trophy.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.146
But when it came
to the Nowitzkis,

22:30.349 --> 22:34.286
Ms. Nowitzki was the pride
of the family, not her husband.

22:39.558 --> 22:42.619
In gym class
we always played basketball.

22:43.061 --> 22:49.194
It wasn't until I was 16 that
I really started playing for a team.

22:49.701 --> 22:54.730
1966 was the first year my wife
played for the national team.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.205
We kind of grew up in the gym.

22:57.409 --> 23:00.811
Every weekend we'd be at
one of our parents' games.

23:01.012 --> 23:03.880
Dirk would be in a baby carrier,

23:04.216 --> 23:06.981
on the substitutes bench,

23:07.185 --> 23:09.677
while our daughter
was learning how to dribble.

23:10.021 --> 23:12.991
Growing up in one house,
we did everything together.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.663
Our two sisters are
one year apart, and so are we.

23:18.296 --> 23:20.561
There'd be games,
Dirk would be too little,

23:20.766 --> 23:22.667
and the other three would say:

23:22.968 --> 23:25.836
"Dirk, you're too small,
you can't play with us."

23:26.371 --> 23:29.603
Of course the youngest
is kept out of things, sure.

23:29.941 --> 23:32.035
Oftentimes he'd
come around at night,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.873
at 10 or 11 p.m.,
after his first round of sleep,

23:35.480 --> 23:37.278
he'd come to me and ask:

23:37.716 --> 23:39.878
"Mom, how do you do this?
How do you do this and that?

23:40.152 --> 23:42.246
They never let me play with them."

23:43.155 --> 23:47.115
So we taught him. That's where
he developed his ambition.

23:47.392 --> 23:50.294
Looks like the old men's league!

23:51.229 --> 23:52.527
Boy, are they good!

23:53.799 --> 23:56.928
Oh, Andi! Nice one, bro!

24:04.943 --> 24:07.139
Tennis was my first game.

24:07.345 --> 24:09.712
I started playing at four or five.

24:09.915 --> 24:13.249
I was ranked No. 6 or 7
for my age group in Bavaria.

24:14.986 --> 24:18.150
I was Lower Franconian Champion.

24:18.356 --> 24:22.452
I wasn't bad. I played
with Mardy Fish and Tommy Haas.

24:22.661 --> 24:23.720
For fun, you know.

24:24.329 --> 24:27.265
They said, "Your serve isn't
bad, but the rest of it..."

24:28.200 --> 24:29.828
And my legwork!
Oh, God!

24:30.268 --> 24:34.296
But my serve
was nothing to be ashamed of.

24:34.506 --> 24:35.769
You know our second date

24:35.974 --> 24:37.567
was actually a tennis match.

24:38.176 --> 24:41.635
You know what, I shouldn't say
that's his only advantage

24:41.847 --> 24:43.975
but he's got
a pretty powerful serve.

24:44.382 --> 24:47.147
And you kind of have to just
put your racket there

24:47.352 --> 24:49.412
and hope the ball
is going to bounce back.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.347
He's got good coverage.
He's all over the court.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.994
But once I get a stop ball in,
then he can't get it.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.490
He's not as fast on his feet.

25:00.065 --> 25:01.863
Shit! I'm an idiot.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.108
Nice one!

25:13.178 --> 25:14.202
That's it!

25:14.646 --> 25:18.708
He could move so skillfully,
at such a young age!

25:18.917 --> 25:23.855
I've never seen anything like
it, shooting and everything.

25:24.422 --> 25:26.857
So we needed to find
a team for him.

25:27.058 --> 25:31.189
Which was tricky, since Dirk
was a good tennis player, too.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.125
His dad wanted him to play handball,

25:34.399 --> 25:36.459
just like he did.

25:39.504 --> 25:40.995
Oh, oh, oh.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.702
It looks just like back then.
Crazy!

25:45.911 --> 25:48.403
This is where I would get changed,

25:48.914 --> 25:50.906
then it was off to the gym.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.393
I was completely enthusiastic.

26:11.603 --> 26:16.166
For a while I did all three
sports at the same time.

26:17.375 --> 26:22.370
And that reflected
on my performance at school.

26:23.448 --> 26:27.852
It was pretty bad, so my parents said
I should drop one of the three.

26:29.321 --> 26:33.190
And so I decided
to drop handball first.

26:33.391 --> 26:36.725
My dad was very disappointed, but...

26:36.928 --> 26:39.762
My father played handball,
and then he was my coach.

26:40.465 --> 26:44.129
And as my coach,
he didn't really like it.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.968
But he accepted it
and soon stopped coaching.

26:50.609 --> 26:54.944
Let's see if I can do a three
pointer in my old school gym.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.115
It's probably not high enough.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.750
Ah!

27:03.288 --> 27:04.984
Oh! I can do better.

27:12.764 --> 27:13.823
Ah!

27:18.269 --> 27:21.296
Ah! I have to sink at least one.

27:24.442 --> 27:25.637
Ah!

27:27.212 --> 27:28.737
Ah!

27:30.815 --> 27:32.113
Ah!

27:33.051 --> 27:34.417
Just like the old days.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.286
Not a single basket.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.161
Ha!

27:47.365 --> 27:50.358
A colleague of mine said,
"Have a talk with him."

27:50.702 --> 27:54.002
It was the English teacher.
"He should sit down,

27:54.205 --> 27:56.936
study and graduate.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.609
He'll never make a living
in basketball."

28:00.679 --> 28:03.513
I'm sure his English is better
than his teacher's now.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.777
And he earns more, too.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.378
Keep it up!
Go to the ball!

28:21.499 --> 28:23.798
Of course in Dirk's case,

28:24.002 --> 28:27.370
if he was considering
playing in the NBA,

28:27.772 --> 28:30.241
he had to offer something
the NBA wanted.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.139
And of course back in our day,

28:33.344 --> 28:37.475
there was virtually no one
who was 6 foot 9 or taller

28:37.849 --> 28:40.546
and could shoot well
from outside.

28:40.752 --> 28:44.052
They put the tall guys under
the hoop to get the rebounds

28:44.255 --> 28:47.089
so the short guys
could shoot again.

28:47.292 --> 28:50.057
Someone who attacks
from the outside,

28:50.428 --> 28:52.420
not someone who's
only under the hoop.

28:52.630 --> 28:56.692
Pit saw it when I was 12 or 13:

28:56.901 --> 28:58.529
That I can dribble, too.

28:58.803 --> 29:01.864
So he gave me the freedom

29:02.307 --> 29:05.573
to play my game and not stand
with my back to the basket,

29:05.877 --> 29:07.903
the way tall guys
are taught in the US.

29:08.113 --> 29:12.881
I let Dirk play outside, even when
he was older, because he was good.

29:13.084 --> 29:17.681
At times it was impossible
to plan anything,

29:17.922 --> 29:22.292
because if I wanted to do anything
requiring a lot of planning,

29:22.494 --> 29:27.091
Holger would say, "Nonsense."
Then he'd grab Dirk and off he'd go.

29:27.565 --> 29:31.900
It's like soccer, when Götze's
dad shows up at Bayern and says,

29:32.103 --> 29:34.265
"I'll do my own training,
during regular practice."

29:34.472 --> 29:39.274
Coach Guardiola would probably say,
"You're banned from the grounds!"

29:40.178 --> 29:44.309
In Dallas, Holger Geschwindner,
who you might call difficult,

29:44.649 --> 29:47.118
was asked by the coach
during practice

29:47.318 --> 29:49.287
to do shooting drills
with five others players.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.479
Quite an unusual situation.

29:51.689 --> 29:53.885
He attends NBA finals
without accreditation.

29:54.425 --> 29:56.758
Security would send anyone else away,

29:57.195 --> 29:59.096
but with him it's,
"Holger! Holger!"

29:59.330 --> 30:02.095
We would not allow Holger in

30:02.300 --> 30:03.996
if he didn't know
what he was talking about.

30:04.502 --> 30:07.404
I just decided it's best
to let those guys go.

30:07.672 --> 30:09.664
Now there was a couple things
I wanted to work on with Dirk

30:09.941 --> 30:11.273
and Holger was great with that.

30:11.843 --> 30:15.610
But I did not want
to change their routine.

30:22.687 --> 30:25.748
Dribble,
plant your foot and duck later.

30:26.191 --> 30:29.127
- I realize that, but...
- Then do it.

30:29.527 --> 30:31.758
The guru of the perfect shot.

30:32.497 --> 30:37.629
And understanding that his work
ethic and precise understanding

30:37.869 --> 30:39.701
of what it meant
to shoot a perfect shot,

30:39.971 --> 30:42.600
and also
to create a perfect player.

30:43.675 --> 30:47.112
He's this mad scientist,
a guy that's always working.

30:47.312 --> 30:49.804
And you can see
what his work has turned into

30:50.014 --> 30:53.007
with the help of
a talented guy like Dirk.

31:00.091 --> 31:03.220
There were more and more requests

31:03.428 --> 31:07.195
about the method,
so finally we decided

31:07.398 --> 31:11.335
to bring it up to date.
We put it in a computer program.

31:11.870 --> 31:16.467
We crammed everything we
knew about basketball into it.

31:16.674 --> 31:21.237
Any planet will do, to a
physicist it doesn't matter.

31:21.446 --> 31:25.144
We can do the sport on the sun,
which would get a bit hot.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.716
Or on Mars.

31:28.620 --> 31:33.684
For the physical calculations
we need to know the gravity,

31:34.525 --> 31:37.393
the g-force of the Earth,
or in this case of Mars.

31:41.432 --> 31:45.028
It all works on the moon,
too, of course.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.705
Houston, the computer's yours.

31:47.939 --> 31:50.875
Thank you, you did a nice
job down there. That was beautiful.

31:51.109 --> 31:54.011
It doesn't matter,
so let's take an NBA court.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.044
We wanted to
sit down with Holger and understand

31:57.315 --> 31:58.908
you know, his techniques

31:59.117 --> 32:03.521
and the way he saw things, because
they were completely innovative.

32:03.721 --> 32:05.053
Here we have Dirk.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.624
Here are his feet.
We can lengthen them,

32:08.826 --> 32:11.955
the upper arm, forearm...
the hand length...

32:12.163 --> 32:14.894
Whatever affects the shot.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.065
Even shoe size plays a role
in the jump.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.737
Then we can have him hop.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.634
The whole thing was conceived

32:25.843 --> 32:28.039
as a purely mathematical
and physical model.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.942
Just to find out
what's really going on.

32:31.316 --> 32:33.046
There's a lot
of guys who are private coaches

32:33.284 --> 32:35.810
and they use it as
a branding or marketing ploy.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.391
Holger could care less about that.
Holger's about the science.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.821
He's looking for
his breakthrough moment.

32:42.026 --> 32:46.430
He wants to break through and
solve this quadratic equation

32:46.864 --> 32:52.064
that provides the best solution to
shooting or moving a basketball.

32:58.209 --> 33:02.772
Here we can go in
and simulate all the possible angles,

33:02.981 --> 33:04.950
the flight curve,
the trajectory.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.946
You can show every
theoretically successful shot.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.482
The research he does
with others and alone

33:11.689 --> 33:17.595
with kinematic motion and the
calculation of throwing motion...

33:17.895 --> 33:20.126
Everyone just says, he's nuts!

33:35.747 --> 33:39.206
The curvature of the ellipsis
is the same as that of the ball,

33:39.550 --> 33:42.645
and that works
at a 47-degree angle,

33:42.854 --> 33:48.725
given the current NBA ball size
and the 18-inch diameter hoops.

33:48.926 --> 33:52.727
You can train anyone to sink
50 percent of their free throws.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.900
Sadly not every pro can manage it.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.025
I made 500 free throws in a row,

34:54.225 --> 34:55.386
without a miss,

34:57.395 --> 35:00.559
431 times. Officially counted!

35:00.765 --> 35:02.893
Not something out in the backyard

35:03.101 --> 35:05.764
with the next-door
neighbor kid counting.

35:06.237 --> 35:07.466
That was officially.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.599
Finally, at the gym
lots of people would say,

35:11.809 --> 35:16.076
"I watch you shooting
every day and you don't miss.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.908
Why don't you go for the
Guinness Book of World Records?"

35:18.116 --> 35:19.482
And I said, "What's that?"

35:20.251 --> 35:24.279
And then I made 2,750,
without a miss.

35:28.626 --> 35:33.087
You can't have an extraneous
thought in your mind...

35:34.265 --> 35:35.265
...at the free throw line.

35:35.466 --> 35:39.301
You could bet the house on it that
I could put it in the basket.

35:39.871 --> 35:44.070
They had a model,
they brought her to the gym

35:44.275 --> 35:46.335
to distract me.

35:46.544 --> 35:49.412
And she had on
a T-shirt up to here...

35:50.615 --> 35:51.810
...you know and shorts.

35:52.016 --> 35:54.315
And whenever she
raised her arms...

35:58.055 --> 35:59.990
And I made them all.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.027
Girls, women, going out.

36:04.462 --> 36:06.294
Drinking too much now and then.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.831
If you can shut that out,
you might become a great one.

36:10.034 --> 36:13.368
And he could shut it out
better than anyone.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.871
The coaches sent their players

36:17.074 --> 36:20.704
to do strength training in the gym.
In the summer...

36:21.345 --> 36:25.680
Outside in the beer gardens,
the ladies show what they have.

36:25.883 --> 36:29.479
You can't send a kid of 16 or 17

36:29.687 --> 36:33.488
into the weight room...
I didn't have the heart for it.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.991
We wondered what to do.
So we built boats

36:37.195 --> 36:40.859
and had a training camp
on Lake Starnberg.

36:44.602 --> 36:47.572
And the old thing: Can I go out?
Tomorrow is practice.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.970
"Sure. Do what you want,

36:51.175 --> 36:52.643
practice is at 7 a.m.

36:52.843 --> 36:55.574
Go ahead, I don't care.
I'll even drive you."

36:55.780 --> 37:00.480
Next morning it was nothing but
alcohol-evaporation training!

37:01.052 --> 37:05.148
The weeding-out of candidates
happened pretty quickly,

37:05.723 --> 37:10.161
because what he was doing
was pretty unusual.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.394
Keep going, that's good!

37:23.741 --> 37:26.404
At national
training courses, we were the ones

37:26.611 --> 37:29.740
who'd been brainwashed
by Geschwindner.

37:29.947 --> 37:31.939
Fellow players
accused us of this.

37:32.149 --> 37:34.448
Half joking, half serious.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.383
We ran into trouble with coaches,

37:37.588 --> 37:40.558
being novices,
whose status was in question.

37:40.758 --> 37:45.219
Many said, "It's not right, it's all
wrong, nothing but nonsense."

37:45.663 --> 37:47.757
And Hodge is nuts, somehow.

37:54.472 --> 37:57.374
Strangely, it really
hit the mark with me at once.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.611
It was clear that I'd improved,

38:00.845 --> 38:03.815
and what the old guy said
actually made sense.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.712
And also,
we got along really well.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.580
So it made sense to do more and more.

38:11.689 --> 38:15.319
Or I can really go and give it
100 percent.

38:16.694 --> 38:17.694
Done!

38:20.164 --> 38:21.257
One, two.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.595
Seventeen... 20...

38:29.106 --> 38:31.337
Others wonder,
"What's the point?"

38:31.542 --> 38:35.502
But such speculation
just gets in the way:

38:35.713 --> 38:38.740
"What is the point of me
doing another 20 minutes

38:38.949 --> 38:41.748
on this damn basketball court?"

38:42.386 --> 38:44.116
Once you ask that, it's over.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.188
Dirk really combines...

38:47.391 --> 38:50.190
...intelligence
with just doing a thing

38:50.394 --> 38:52.989
because it's necessary,
without asking why.

38:53.464 --> 38:56.457
I do a few yoga
exercises every day.

38:56.667 --> 39:01.037
one for
the groin, one for the behind.

39:01.238 --> 39:05.198
Yogis call this one "the frog."

39:06.844 --> 39:10.372
And this yoga exercise...

39:11.248 --> 39:13.808
...is called "the half-pigeon,"
I believe.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.314
You maintain this pose,

39:16.887 --> 39:19.652
and it's a mean stretch
that gets to the groin.

39:20.257 --> 39:23.887
I hold it for two minutes,
you can really feel it.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.823
This is the "downward dog."

39:31.369 --> 39:34.032
Everyone who watches
me play says:

39:34.438 --> 39:36.202
"You look so stiff at the hip."

39:36.874 --> 39:38.365
Which is actually true.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.810
But it has improved.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.323
Every year there is
a game of international all-stars

39:53.524 --> 39:56.926
against the best high
school players in the US:

39:57.128 --> 40:01.725
The Hoop Summit.
You compete with world-class players.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.394
At the same time in Germany,
we had

40:04.602 --> 40:09.336
the play-off games to
move up into the first league.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.710
Dirk was one of the most
important players,

40:13.144 --> 40:17.206
but the dates clashed.
So how to solve this dilemma?

40:17.548 --> 40:19.676
There was quite a bit of controversy

40:19.984 --> 40:24.718
surrounding getting Dirk
to play in the Hoop Summit,

40:24.922 --> 40:26.948
which was played in San Antonio.

40:27.158 --> 40:31.220
Dirk knew nothing
about it. Then "he" turns up at 6 a.m.,

40:31.896 --> 40:33.194
picks up Dirk...

40:33.397 --> 40:37.061
It knocked our socks off.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.204
He hadn't even told the team
he was leaving.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.769
That's Geschwindner for you!

40:53.017 --> 40:56.545
Dirk Nowitzki had left

40:56.754 --> 40:59.417
for an NBA scouting
tournament in America.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.218
I was in the gym, Dirk was missing,

41:02.426 --> 41:04.486
and we were in the play-offs.

41:05.996 --> 41:10.161
I knew nothing,
then we heard what was up.

41:10.701 --> 41:12.829
Everyone was like, how could he?

41:13.037 --> 41:14.596
And I think this was

41:14.839 --> 41:17.775
a very difficult decision
for him to make.

41:17.975 --> 41:22.913
One, to abandon his club
and his friends and his people,

41:23.881 --> 41:25.577
and his teammates.

41:25.783 --> 41:28.651
And, frankly, there were
some people who didn't believe

41:28.853 --> 41:32.017
that Dirk was ready
to play on a global stage

41:32.223 --> 41:36.661
against the very best players
in his age group in the world.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.361
...inside
the Alamo Stadium Arena,

41:39.563 --> 41:41.532
for the fourth annual
Nike Hoop Summit.

41:41.732 --> 41:43.667
Team USA against the world.

41:43.868 --> 41:46.463
Take a look there, that's
Jason Capel and Nowitzki.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.036
Those are the two players...

41:48.239 --> 41:49.935
There are a lot of stars here.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.140
And there's a chance to see them

41:51.342 --> 41:53.208
before they move on
to the next level.

41:54.478 --> 41:57.539
Normally what happens as
scouts, you hear about players

41:57.748 --> 42:00.149
over in Europe and how great
they are, how tall they are.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.719
And by the time they land
on U.S. shores

42:03.988 --> 42:06.856
they're not quite as good and
they're about six inches shorter

42:07.091 --> 42:08.992
than they're reported to be.

42:09.193 --> 42:14.632
So when Dirk walked in that night
with his coach Holger Geschwindner,

42:15.065 --> 42:18.126
I was happy to see he actually
was close to seven feet.

42:19.003 --> 42:21.700
Here's Nowitzki,
from Germany. Strong to the bucket!

42:21.906 --> 42:25.206
He meant business on that trip,
and draws the foul.

42:25.776 --> 42:29.645
Here's Nowitzki, in traffic again.
He gets called for traveling.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.876
Already five of five.

42:32.750 --> 42:34.241
Responsible for
most of the World points.

42:34.451 --> 42:36.181
Make it six of six.

42:36.420 --> 42:39.913
The World team
leading Team USA 52 to 49.

42:40.124 --> 42:44.585
Thanks in large part to German
Dirk Nowitzki, 14 points.

42:44.795 --> 42:48.061
From the first time
I saw him play, you could see

42:48.299 --> 42:54.205
this guy shoots the ball like no
big man we've ever, ever seen.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.670
I saw that he
had the ability to play

42:56.874 --> 42:58.206
like a smaller player.

42:58.943 --> 43:00.844
He could play multiple positions.

43:01.545 --> 43:03.673
So my mind was going very fast

43:03.881 --> 43:06.441
about what a great player
I could make

43:06.650 --> 43:09.347
of this young,
19-year-old German.

43:11.789 --> 43:14.088
Nowitzki
very strong from the line.

43:16.660 --> 43:20.688
The crucial thing was,
take the ball and get it in there.

43:20.965 --> 43:25.801
And if they hack you,
you have to keep going.

43:34.645 --> 43:36.443
The World team won the game.

43:36.647 --> 43:38.912
Up until about two or three years ago

43:39.149 --> 43:43.712
Dirk held the single-game scoring
record in the Hoop Summit.

43:43.921 --> 43:46.220
No question, Dan, this guy is
a guy we could see in the NBA.

43:46.423 --> 43:48.756
31 points, 13 boards
for Dirk Nowitzki.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.120
Are we going to see you
back here in the NBA?

43:50.327 --> 43:51.625
Maybe another Detlef Schrempf?

43:51.829 --> 43:53.821
Oh I hope so, you know.
I don't know yet.

43:54.031 --> 43:55.397
- Thanks, congratulations.
- Thank you.

43:55.599 --> 43:58.296
There were 15 or maybe 20 colleges

43:59.003 --> 44:02.963
who called during the period
when Dirk was 19,

44:03.340 --> 44:05.138
because they really wanted him.

44:05.342 --> 44:07.937
When will we see you in the NBA?

44:08.879 --> 44:11.178
- Maybe never.
- Are you trying to get there

44:11.382 --> 44:13.681
without joining a college team?

44:13.884 --> 44:16.649
- I don't think so.
- It's unlikely.

44:16.854 --> 44:19.153
I'm not good enough,
I still have a lot to learn.

44:19.523 --> 44:22.254
The idea was
to get him into the NBA draft

44:22.626 --> 44:24.754
where he'd be ranked.

44:24.962 --> 44:28.592
Then the number
to the right of his name

44:28.799 --> 44:32.099
would indicate
his actual market value.

44:32.302 --> 44:35.932
The draft is not an
obligation for players.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.200
It's an awarding of rights,

44:38.409 --> 44:41.504
in which weaker teams
are given an advantage

44:41.912 --> 44:44.143
in acquiring rights

44:44.348 --> 44:48.376
through negotiations
with talented amateurs.

44:48.719 --> 44:50.278
The sixth pick...

44:53.157 --> 44:55.058
goes to the Dallas Mavericks.

44:55.259 --> 44:57.057
Every team is slotted in.

44:57.261 --> 45:01.494
And the worst team in the NBA

45:01.732 --> 45:03.564
has the first pick in the draft.

45:03.767 --> 45:06.669
And the team with the best record
has the last pick in the draft.

45:06.904 --> 45:09.339
And that's how
the NBA makes itself healthy.

45:09.540 --> 45:13.307
It was really Donnie Nelson
whose team found Dirk.

45:13.510 --> 45:15.172
He was the one
who pushed his dad.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.711
"Listen,
we're going to get killed,

45:16.914 --> 45:19.145
I know it,
but we've got to draft this guy.

45:19.349 --> 45:20.874
He's a revolutionary player.

45:21.085 --> 45:23.577
We've never seen a big man
like him, trust me."

45:23.787 --> 45:26.586
We spent the night
sitting here after practicing

45:26.790 --> 45:28.759
in Rattelsdorf. He stayed here,

45:28.959 --> 45:33.021
because of the time difference.
So we sat around the phone.

45:33.597 --> 45:37.034
Dirk Nowitzki,
from Würzburg, Germany.

45:37.534 --> 45:40.402
You know, Americans know there are
good players in those leagues.

45:40.604 --> 45:42.903
They don't know anything
about the Bundesliga.

45:43.107 --> 45:45.440
They've never heard
about the Würzburg X-Rays.

45:45.642 --> 45:47.201
They don't know
anything about this guy.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.380
He can also
stay and play in Germany

45:49.580 --> 45:51.572
because the division Il team
that he played on

45:51.782 --> 45:53.512
qualified to play division I.

45:53.717 --> 45:57.677
And he's getting home-country
pressure to stay in Germany

45:57.888 --> 46:00.585
and play for the home team now that
they're going to be a division I team.

46:00.791 --> 46:02.623
If a general manager

46:02.826 --> 46:05.455
drafts someone in the first round,

46:07.097 --> 46:08.565
and he doesn't come,

46:08.932 --> 46:13.131
then the scouting and
preparations were badly done.

46:13.403 --> 46:15.963
It seems it has never
happened in America.

46:16.306 --> 46:17.899
And we had to convince Dirk

46:18.142 --> 46:20.373
that he was ready for the NBA.

46:20.611 --> 46:22.546
He wasn't sure that he was.

46:22.746 --> 46:26.911
He thought maybe he would play one
or two more years for his local team

46:27.117 --> 46:30.212
and develop,
and then come to the NBA.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.556
Of course we
needed him right away.

46:32.756 --> 46:34.384
We were one of the
worst teams in the league.

46:49.706 --> 46:51.971
I got a call from an editor:

46:52.176 --> 46:55.010
"Drive up there,
it's about Dirk Nowitzki."

46:56.947 --> 46:58.939
The Wittelsbacher Höh Hotel.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.592
The atmosphere will have
impressed the Americans.

47:08.792 --> 47:10.317
It's very German, at least.

47:11.028 --> 47:13.088
Down winding corridors,

47:15.299 --> 47:17.029
and here's the nice lounge:

47:17.501 --> 47:19.697
The Balthasar Neumann room.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.336
...Presumably negotiate...

47:22.539 --> 47:24.030
Moving on...

47:25.242 --> 47:27.143
I would like to
welcome you here to Würzburg.

47:27.377 --> 47:28.640
It's a great pleasure.

47:29.313 --> 47:31.942
And Nelson was pretty surprised

47:32.749 --> 47:35.378
that only local TV was there,

47:35.586 --> 47:37.885
and two reporters, that's it.

47:38.088 --> 47:40.956
Over there
they're used to having

47:41.158 --> 47:43.821
a bunch of TV
crews and reporters.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.791
There were only
two people there.

47:45.996 --> 47:48.830
They looked in,
asked who was still expected.

47:49.032 --> 47:52.730
Then they came out with
what would be unthinkable now:

47:52.936 --> 47:57.135
They offered a three-year contract
at $1.3 million per year.

47:57.341 --> 47:58.866
That was on the table,

47:59.076 --> 48:02.569
and they were hinting that
they'd consider more if need be.

48:10.187 --> 48:12.088
They let us know that no matter how,

48:12.289 --> 48:14.053
we had to go to Dallas with them.

49:13.317 --> 49:17.584
They had the whole
Mavericks office at the airport,

49:17.988 --> 49:19.286
they had welcome signs,

49:19.489 --> 49:23.051
and really gave it
everything they had.

49:23.260 --> 49:26.230
So we were thinking,
the two of us,

49:26.430 --> 49:28.160
things are heating up:

49:28.365 --> 49:31.460
The NBA after three years,
should we or shouldn't we?

49:31.668 --> 49:33.830
So then of course they tried

49:34.438 --> 49:37.567
to make the city
as appealing to him as possible,

49:38.008 --> 49:40.603
and to show him
all the sites and so on.

49:40.811 --> 49:42.643
You can get a shot.

49:42.879 --> 49:44.404
This is what I'm showing you.

49:44.614 --> 49:47.482
See this is where the arena's
going to sit. Right over here.

49:47.684 --> 49:51.485
Around the arena we're going
to have like restaurants...

49:51.989 --> 49:56.017
We're going to have German food.
Over there. "Dirk's Place."

50:05.669 --> 50:07.331
I don't know how to button it.

50:07.637 --> 50:09.401
The NBA
made a dress code. Thank God!

50:09.539 --> 50:11.599
Because somebody like Dirk
needed it the most.

50:12.876 --> 50:16.369
Otherwise he would wear
Nike sweats every day forever.

50:16.580 --> 50:19.880
So you had to wear
a collared shirt and slacks.

50:20.083 --> 50:22.951
Or jeans and a collared shirt,
or a blazer.

50:23.153 --> 50:26.487
So Dirk had to get clothes made
for him for the first time.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.556
Ladies and gentlemen,
Steve Nash.

50:31.995 --> 50:34.362
- Dirk, this is Steve.
- How you doing?

50:34.564 --> 50:37.898
You know,
it seemed a world away for him,

50:38.535 --> 50:40.231
from Würzburg.

50:40.437 --> 50:45.171
Probably he was a little timid
and not sure

50:45.842 --> 50:47.367
how he was going
to handle all this.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.173
- I guess I'll sit here.
- All right.

50:52.783 --> 50:54.547
I don't feel any pressure,
you know. Just...

50:54.751 --> 50:58.688
I'll call my parents tonight,
and speak with Holger over it and

50:58.889 --> 51:01.882
I want to sleep over it,
and tomorrow I'll make a decision.

51:03.393 --> 51:07.057
Let me introduce Holger, who is
over here. Also with a new suit.

51:09.132 --> 51:11.067
That was just as difficult.

51:13.437 --> 51:16.532
The wrong commitment
and I'm getting the suit back.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.336
It also fits me.

51:22.712 --> 51:25.876
And I must say,
that really hit my wife.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.779
It was the worst.

51:28.318 --> 51:31.083
For her it was the worst
that Dirk was over there,

51:31.288 --> 51:33.120
because her baby was gone.

51:33.323 --> 51:35.758
I think it was also because
it was so far from our world.

51:35.959 --> 51:40.863
If it were somewhere in Europe,
you can still imagine it,

51:41.231 --> 51:43.223
but NBA and America
and Dallas, Texas!

51:43.433 --> 51:45.595
We knew nothing
about it back then.

51:45.802 --> 51:49.796
"The Yanks should take their own
kids and leave mine with me."

51:51.007 --> 51:52.475
It was everything for him,

51:52.676 --> 51:54.144
the NBA...

51:55.145 --> 51:57.080
We didn't want to stand in his way.

51:57.781 --> 52:02.242
They only won 20 games last year,
and want to win 20, 25 this year.

52:02.452 --> 52:04.580
So it's low expectations
and low pressure.

52:04.788 --> 52:07.087
Of course there's
pressure on a rookie,

52:07.290 --> 52:10.317
but I think
you can play a season in peace,

52:10.527 --> 52:12.052
and see if you can develop there.

52:12.262 --> 52:13.753
Nellie right away said,

52:13.964 --> 52:15.262
"Dirk will be
the rookie of the year."

52:15.465 --> 52:17.593
So that only added the pressure

52:17.801 --> 52:20.635
on a kid, who...
He really was a kid.

52:35.318 --> 52:38.652
When I first got here
he didn't ever say anything.

52:38.855 --> 52:40.118
He never talked to anybody.

52:40.323 --> 52:43.293
He was just kind of absorbing
what was going on around him.

52:43.493 --> 52:44.493
...free throw.

52:44.694 --> 52:46.185
- The best ever!
- Yes, sir.

52:47.030 --> 52:49.124
And... Come on now.

52:49.332 --> 52:52.860
Mashburn between the legs,
goes baseline, slips and falls.

52:53.403 --> 52:57.306
But they were the worst team
for the majority of the 90s.

53:02.512 --> 53:04.310
When Steve Nash had the ball,

53:04.514 --> 53:09.543
and there were never more
than 8000 spectators there,

53:09.753 --> 53:11.688
they'd just boo him.

53:11.888 --> 53:14.221
At times Dirk wasn't
allowed to play.

53:25.068 --> 53:26.536
He loses the ball as

53:26.770 --> 53:28.170
Anderson makes the steal.

53:29.372 --> 53:33.036
Nowitzki in a crowd, muscles it out,
gets the board and draws the foul.

53:33.243 --> 53:36.680
Nowitzki called for the foul in a
wrestling match with Tyrone Hill.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.542
Nowitzki is out.

53:39.349 --> 53:41.909
So the media and the fans picked
up on that and it was like,

53:42.219 --> 53:44.518
"Come on Nellie, you said
this was the Rookie of the Year

53:44.754 --> 53:46.484
and he can't even
get off your bench?"

53:47.424 --> 53:49.859
That was a lot of pressure
that he put on themselves.

53:50.594 --> 53:53.496
The speed of the game, the
physicality of that position,

53:53.697 --> 53:55.825
because he had to play
power forward.

53:56.032 --> 53:59.992
Just living day-to-day life
was a huge adjustment for him.

54:04.074 --> 54:07.704
The NBA is a place that's
full of press pressure.

54:08.245 --> 54:11.738
Media pressure,
expectations from the public.

54:12.249 --> 54:16.619
And they will ask you lots and lots
of questions on and off the court.

54:17.487 --> 54:20.047
For an international player,
like Dirk, like me,

54:20.257 --> 54:24.285
that goes overseas to the States,
to fit in to a new community

54:24.494 --> 54:28.022
that would spend lots and lots
of our energy, our focus.

54:32.068 --> 54:33.559
In the 80s and the 90s

54:33.803 --> 54:35.635
when European players
first started coming over here

54:35.839 --> 54:38.536
all of them were branded:
"You're soft."

54:38.742 --> 54:41.610
And Dirk's talked about this a lot.
So when Dirk was coming up,

54:41.811 --> 54:44.110
he was soft too:
"You're just a soft European."

54:44.314 --> 54:47.478
"Europeans don't play defense.
Europeans aren't good enough.

54:47.684 --> 54:49.277
Europeans
aren't mentally tough enough."

54:50.120 --> 54:52.089
So he came to me and he said,

54:52.922 --> 54:55.585
"Oh, I think
I want to go home."

54:56.293 --> 55:00.628
And that was the most dramatic
thing that happened that year.

55:01.331 --> 55:05.098
We had a lady named Lisa Tyner

55:05.302 --> 55:09.967
who worked in the office
and kind of adopted Dirk.

55:23.687 --> 55:25.986
Thanks man, that's awesome.
I'll steal it all.

55:36.700 --> 55:37.963
The one and only!

55:40.136 --> 55:42.162
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yes.

55:42.372 --> 55:44.136
The one and only. Lisa.

55:46.309 --> 55:50.269
When he first came
he needed a little help

55:50.513 --> 55:52.038
just getting acclimated.

55:52.248 --> 55:55.116
I mean, he's a young man
that was in a foreign country

55:55.318 --> 55:57.947
and he was trying to set up
a house for himself.

55:58.154 --> 56:00.714
He needed questions answered
and he needed to know

56:00.924 --> 56:03.325
that there was somebody here
he could reach out to

56:03.526 --> 56:06.189
and ask those questions
and get answers.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.197
- How long is the drive?
- About five hours.

56:10.400 --> 56:12.665
You better get going
so you beat the traffic too.

56:16.072 --> 56:17.973
Are you trying to get rid of me?

56:19.442 --> 56:20.876
Never.

56:38.795 --> 56:42.493
In the beginning
he received a lot of fan mail.

56:42.699 --> 56:45.828
And he would take it home
every day

56:46.202 --> 56:47.534
and put it in the corner
of his apartment,

56:47.737 --> 56:49.729
and he never
got around to opening it.

56:49.939 --> 56:54.604
And a lot of his endorsement checks
ended up in that pile of fan mail

56:54.811 --> 56:56.575
and didn't get deposited.

56:56.780 --> 57:00.217
So when
his mom came over to visit

57:00.417 --> 57:04.184
she got busy with the fan mail
and realized

57:04.387 --> 57:06.083
that that system
wasn't going to work.

57:06.556 --> 57:08.548
He couldn't even...

57:09.292 --> 57:11.056
...boil water in a kettle.

57:11.461 --> 57:13.191
He couldn't withdraw money.

57:13.396 --> 57:15.524
He couldn't cook or anything.

57:15.732 --> 57:17.257
Mom did it all.

57:17.734 --> 57:22.069
He still has his mother
give him money when he's here.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.275
He says,
"Ma, I need gas money."

57:26.910 --> 57:28.879
My wife goes and withdraws money

57:29.245 --> 57:30.873
and puts it in his piggy bank.

57:31.648 --> 57:34.914
It's... still crazy,
but that's how it is.

57:35.118 --> 57:37.781
It's my overprotective nature.

57:40.824 --> 57:43.293
I'm the same to this day.

57:49.933 --> 57:52.300
It's a very
important decision in the NBA,

57:52.502 --> 57:54.994
who your agent is,
who your financial manager is.

57:55.205 --> 57:57.902
So we had dinner in Dallas
and then I said,

57:58.107 --> 58:00.167
"Hopefully you're going to be
making a lot of money one day.

58:00.376 --> 58:02.470
who will serve
as your financial manager?"

58:02.679 --> 58:04.272
And they thought about it
and Dirk said:

58:04.514 --> 58:05.982
"My mom.
She has a degree in accounting."

58:06.216 --> 58:07.741
So I realized, in Dirk's life,

58:07.951 --> 58:10.614
it was going to stay within those
key people that were in his life.

58:10.820 --> 58:12.618
And still to this day
are the key people

58:12.856 --> 58:15.087
that help make him who he is.

58:16.359 --> 58:17.588
For Nowitzki.

58:18.328 --> 58:20.263
Nice work by Robert Pack.

58:25.134 --> 58:26.932
To Nowitzki for the dunk.

58:27.537 --> 58:30.530
He tried to work on his
quickness, worked on his strength

58:31.541 --> 58:33.942
to be able to take
the pounding of the NBA.

58:34.544 --> 58:35.978
He always worked on his game.

58:36.179 --> 58:38.671
He was what we call
in the States a "gym rat."

58:38.882 --> 58:43.877
And gym rats with great talent
usually work out for the best.

58:52.262 --> 58:57.462
We got the call from Ross Perot, who
was our first owner, as you know.

58:57.934 --> 59:02.030
And Ross said,
"I sold the team."

59:03.072 --> 59:05.564
He said, "I think you guys
are going to be okay."

59:05.775 --> 59:07.471
Which usually means
the kiss of death

59:07.677 --> 59:09.737
for a head coach
and assistant coach.

59:10.246 --> 59:13.375
And the next thing I heard
was "Cuban."

59:13.850 --> 59:15.978
You know, you're kind of numb
when you get that call.

59:16.786 --> 59:18.846
And my first response was:

59:19.122 --> 59:21.353
"Am I going to have to
learn to speak Spanish?"

59:21.925 --> 59:23.723
Because I thought
he was from Cuba.

59:23.927 --> 59:26.089
I didn't think... I didn't know
it was his name.

59:32.602 --> 59:34.696
He was lucky with his company,

59:34.904 --> 59:37.271
which he sold to Broadcast.

59:37.974 --> 59:41.001
Or vice versa, he sold Broadcast

59:41.277 --> 59:45.009
to that big company
that's just gone bankrupt.

59:45.615 --> 59:47.277
Yahoo, yes.

59:47.717 --> 59:50.619
He had Broadcast,
and sold it to Yahoo.

59:51.721 --> 59:54.190
He was more and more into sport.

59:54.390 --> 59:56.518
I mean,
it wasn't really a lot of negotiation.

59:56.726 --> 59:57.750
I wanted the team.

59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.294
And this was during
the internet go-go bubble.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:03.193
And so the funny
behind-the-scenes fact

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:07.063
is that there would be days when
the stock price of our company

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.432
would go up 20, 30 dollars.

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.369
And that would pay for the
whole price of the Mavericks.

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:13.770
That's how crazy
the stock market was.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.070
And so I really didn't negotiate.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.746
I said,
"How much do you want for it?"

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:20.772
He gave me a price, 285 million.
I said yes, and it was over.

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.782
Then it was just a matter
of doing the paperwork.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.455
He loved the Mavericks.
He was a fan of the team.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:28.284
He came to all the games
as a season ticket holder.

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:32.155
He wasn't doing this for the money.
He wanted to be involved in sports.

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.891
And he brought
a positivity and an energy

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:39.069
that was completely missing
from the previous regime.

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:43.137
Mark Cuban wakes up
in the morning thinking about

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.932
how his team can win.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:48.600
And goes to sleep at night thinking
about how his team can win.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:51.337
And spends all day thinking
about how his team can win.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:55.484
Mark put a lot of detail
in owning the team.

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:59.348
So the locker room was nicer,
the towels, robes.

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:01.786
We got a new plane,
we stayed at nicer hotels.

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.851
The best is yet to come.

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:41.554
And Dirk
gets his tooth knocked out.

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:44.063
And runs right off the court,

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:47.203
jumps over the scorer's table and
runs straight to the locker room.

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.304
At first nobody knew
what happened.

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:54.043
Dirk literally took the shot to
the mouth and ran back there.

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:56.144
At first nobody knew
what happened.

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.712
Then they worked on him,
stopped the bleeding,

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.242
stuck something in his mouth
where his tooth was.

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.047
And he came back
and he played the game.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:08.550
And the Mavs ended up winning
that series in five games.

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:13.696
That was another one of those moments
that really established Dirk as,

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:17.333
"Okay, this is not your average
European guy who's come to the NBA."

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.900
Nowitzki's picked Bryant.

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:23.938
A footrace here. Kobe
has to foul. And it counts!

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:29.576
Juwan Howard. Pass caught by Dirk
Nowitzki. For three... Got it!

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:58.903
I was in
the play-offs 12 years in a row.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:03.978
That's a lot of games.
I mean, 82 games,

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.449
there are eight preseason games,

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:09.710
and normally the
play-offs on top. I think

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:13.723
the year that we
won the championship

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.119
we played almost 110 games.

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:18.656
That's a bunch.

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:21.092
So of course
you're a bit worn out

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:24.063
and you relax a little
after the season.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:28.264
In the beginning of my career
I'd only take a month off,

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.838
then I'd start training
with Holger again.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.112
Aw, shit! Not now!

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:41.113
Not now!
No, I got to concentrate.

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:43.653
Done! I need a 20.

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:47.824
Are you in? Do you feel
like it? I'll put us both up.

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:50.357
But, definitely,
doesn't like to lose.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.088
Especially if he's bowling with his
wife, Jessica, she usually beats him.

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:56.459
So I don't think
he takes that very well.

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:59.662
Yeah, you can definitely see the
competitive side of him come out.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:01.865
Come on!

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.039
Why left?

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:14.979
Nice!

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.715
I'm the worst bowler ever.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:24.686
I mean, I'm so unlucky.
It's crazy.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:29.221
I don't know, maybe it's just he kind
of has to bend his knees a bit more.

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:31.560
I don't know.
Maybe that's what it is.

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.360
That's how we going to be?

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:34.736
"Call Holger!"

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:36.030
"Call Holger!"

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.234
Bowling is jazz!

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:46.082
Bowling is jazz.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.047
Nice!

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:00.726
I think one of
yesterday's bottles of red wine was bad.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:05.864
My stomach is fluttering.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.704
I used to hate red wine.

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.340
I'd mostly drink beer.

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:17.342
I think last time
was around the All-Star Game,

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.412
when I had a few days off,

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.612
and I drank a glass of wine.

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:25.083
But otherwise during the season,
it's none at all.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:28.524
Sometimes you miss it
a bit with a meal.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:30.191
But...

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:33.055
But in the summer
I do drink some.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.860
Though not as excessively
as yesterday.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.136
He's always
sort of been a warrior,

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:43.567
and he's always...

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:48.040
You know, he's very good with his diet
during the season. He sticks with it.

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:50.611
I can order burgers or pizzas
if we go out,

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.644
and he would not even take a bite.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:56.252
I think talent and a bit of luck

01:05:56.852 --> 01:06:00.289
make up 10 or 20 percent,
the other 80 is willpower

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.321
and hard work...

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:06.923
You don't get it
handed to you at birth.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:08.757
Every summer

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.935
I'd do thousands of jump shots
in Rattelsdorf.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:15.104
I played on the national team
for ten or eleven years.

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:18.797
I'd play the summer league, then
go back to the national team.

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.183
The national team,
in its successful days,

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.917
all its players
were born the same year,

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.119
and had been on youth teams.

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.127
At first it was his
Würzburg gang

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:44.425
that he'd dragged along
to the national team.

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:47.125
They were successful,
he was proud.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.670
All NBA owners, they don't want

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.276
their guys playing
for the national teams.

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.276
because they pay all the salary.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.348
In the NBA international
basketball, even the Olympics,

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:02.848
is seen as secondary
to winning an NBA championship.

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:06.489
When we judge great players,
if you've got a gold medal

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.214
but you don't have
an NBA championship,

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.357
sorry the gold medal's not enough.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:18.229
Last year
a company that works for the NBA

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:21.734
created a marketing-related list.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:24.202
I was No. 1,

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:27.536
the most-marketable player.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:31.336
So everyone was saying,
"you've got to capitalize on this."

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.982
But it's really not my thing.

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.414
Imagine I had 20 contracts!

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.884
They'd be pulling me
by the nose all summer,

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:42.217
whenever I'd have
time for myself,

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.651
from one photo shoot to the next.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.989
Which is why I
only have two sponsors.

01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:00.208
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.742
and welcome to you,
Helmut Schmidt.

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:05.510
The setting is perfect.

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.683
They all felt like bankers,

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:11.115
understood everything
about business,

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.879
until it all went wrong.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.125
Lots of milk. Half and half?

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.796
Sugar, too, please.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:34.270
- How old are you now?
- I'll be 35 next week.

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:37.777
How much longer will you play?
Ten years? Less?

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:40.415
Less. Three or four, I guess.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:43.313
It gets hard to play at forty.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:46.785
It gets... it gets really tough.

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.654
You ought to start,

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.760
if you haven't already,

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.991
to study a bit on the side.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.826
Yes, I study a bit.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:02.505
- Some business studies.
- Yes. That's it!

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.334
Yeah.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.435
Then he said,

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.407
"If you quit at 35,
you'll need another job.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.584
You'll have to study."

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:16.952
So I said,

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:20.149
"I'm studying business."
I lied.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:21.654
Really?

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:24.156
Studying? In this life?

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.863
In the US it's more basic.

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:40.508
They say,
"This is how you dribble,

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.678
this is how you score."

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:45.973
But the detail
Holger pays attention to,

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.946
that's what makes him unique.

01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:51.381
I've worked
with lots of coaches over there,

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.783
but in terms of
shooting technique,

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.350
and all the things
requiring attention,

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:59.393
the details...
That's what makes him

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.655
the best in the world, in my opinion.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.726
What they do is they go back every year.

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:09.371
Holger's got what he calls
"Dirk's toolbox."

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.540
And they add something to
that toolbox every single year.

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:17.406
In the early days it was
rebounding, it was a post game.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:39.362
They wanted to
go to training, and these cars drive up,

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:43.865
and Holger leaves, saying,
"See you at the gym."

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.546
We'd arranged to meet and practice

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.176
over in Rattelsdorf,

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:54.782
then Dirk suddenly called.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.885
"The taxmen are here.

01:10:57.486 --> 01:10:59.011
They won't let me out."

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:03.420
"There are all these people at
my mother's, more at my sister's..."

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:06.891
And here, there were something like

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.292
four or five men,

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:11.899
who searched the whole place.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.469
They investigated Nike, DiBa,

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:24.442
thinking I'd taken
all these commissions

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:26.411
and so on...
Of course I hadn't.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:30.108
In the end
I had to go with them,

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:32.550
and I was imprisoned
for four-and-a-half weeks.

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:44.463
Geschwindner said
he hadn't filed a tax form.

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:49.230
You just can't do that
for two or three years.

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:52.799
It was a bad time for Holger,

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:57.641
but he made the best of it,
organizing the prison library,

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.779
making sure his fellow inmates

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:03.081
got good things to read.

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:04.981
So he made himself useful.

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:15.426
It was obvious that Dirk...

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:18.493
would stick up for Holger.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.441
Dirk and I weren't in touch,

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:30.511
but when they set that
astronomical bail,

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.649
Dirk scraped it together.

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:39.848
I said, "Anyone who pays that kind
of bail is with me all the way."

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:43.321
Then they said to me,
"Sign this,

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:46.893
and you're basically free to go."

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:03.507
Nobody believes someone would
take no money and do it all,

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:06.705
simply because he wants to.
But that's it.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:10.986
And the story is so exotic
it seems unbelievable.

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:15.817
And Holger's chaotic lifestyle,
which he lives out of principle,

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:18.556
that didn't help back then.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.701
He's not a regular guy.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.734
He doesn't...

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:38.042
Wealth and possessions
are not what motivates him.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:44.110
I was around during that time
and know, from my experience,

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.254
because I know
where Dirk's money is,

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:49.220
that Holger was not being paid.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.293
Not from any money in the U.S.
I know that as a fact.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.606
Game One goes to Dallas.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:14.416
A well-deserved win by the Mavs.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.781
The Dallas Mavericks with
a convincing victory once again

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:21.252
here in the
American Airlines Center.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.916
They lead the NBA Finals 2-0.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.796
They were leading 2-0,

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:30.394
I hadn't seen the game in Dallas,

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:33.132
I only flew in for Florida.

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.905
When we got to Miami,

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.265
it was a state of emergency:

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.773
The huge pressure was obvious,

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.773
we hardly spoke to Dirk,

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.477
he was so focused.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:47.647
Big shot. Miami with a two-point lead.

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.944
Mark Cuban and his Mavericks,
though, with plenty of time.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.980
Misses the free throw!

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:56.948
Wade. And a foul!

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.650
With 1.4 remaining!

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:02.298
And then things
really went downhill.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.525
It was crazy! We arrived
and they lost all their games.

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:09.136
And Harris puts it up for the win!

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.001
No good!

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:14.472
And Miami wins again
to take a 3:2 lead.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.511
It was heartbreaking,

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.806
seeing the team and Dirk,

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:24.783
the effort they made,
but they couldn't prevent it.

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:27.513
Terry puts it up... Won't go!

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:28.952
Rebound Wade!

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.517
The Miami Heat, they've done it!

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:34.788
They win their first championship
in franchise history.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.832
I didn't leave my house
for three weeks.

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:46.740
I couldn't face anybody,
didn't want to see anybody.

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:49.309
Didn't want to talk basketball,
didn't want to think basketball.

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.140
I just didn't want
to see anybody.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.814
I felt like
I let everybody down.

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.349
So it was painful.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.889
From a business,
career perspective,

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:02.353
one of the most painful things
I've ever lived through.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.858
Never want to have to do it again.

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:06.652
But it hurt.
Yeah, it definitely hurt.

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:10.397
That's basketball.
That's the beauty of our game.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:14.593
It is based upon so very little

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:18.230
in terms of the ability
to win or lose.

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:37.415
Dirk was branded a loser. He's
never going to get over the hump.

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:40.093
He's never going to be able to
lead a team to a championship.

01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:43.959
And in the NBA that's probably
the worst thing you can say

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.566
about a star player.

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:49.795
You can't keep up
with the emotions, with the media:

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:51.766
One day you're the greatest,

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:55.210
and the next day
you're the fool, or...

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.641
You have to try

01:16:58.013 --> 01:17:00.778
to keep it all
in some equilibrium,

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:04.112
and not to rise or fall
with every emotion.

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:08.480
That's how I dealt with it,
though you can't ignore it all.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.158
You're aware of it.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:14.763
I remember he said, I've
achieved nothing in my life.

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:18.960
Had I sunk that free throw in Miami,

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.795
everything would have been different.

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:23.598
This is a guy
with a 90%- plus average.

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:26.001
That's better than anyone else.

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:27.801
There I am opposite him,

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:31.469
I'm happy if I become local
champion in Fürstenfeldbruck,

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.844
and he thinks
he's achieved nothing.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:37.417
That demonstrated his mindset.

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:39.087
And to see how...

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:43.253
Well, getting there again
won't be easy, for sure.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.791
Whether or not you'd ever have

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:48.486
such a chance in your career
was also quite questionable.

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.957
After a big disappointment,

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.701
usually there's only two ways
it can go.

01:17:55.904 --> 01:18:01.639
Either you work even harder
than before, or you give up.

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:04.608
I've seen Dirk
choose the first path.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:15.789
Dirk Nowitzki!

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:28.961
In 2006/07 it looked
like the Mavs bounced back

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:32.073
from what happened in 2006
amazingly well.

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:34.140
They won 67 games.

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:37.176
They started 0-4
and still won 67 games.

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.905
Dirk was the MVP,
amazing season.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.386
It got to the point where
people around the league thought,

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:56.524
"They're never going to win
with this guy."

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:59.861
And Dirk took all that burden
on himself.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:03.527
He didn't have anyone really
to share it with at that point.

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.937
It was pretty bad,
yes. To see him...

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:13.544
...all hunched over when
he went out, that hurts, yes.

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:19.211
But an athlete
always has to get back up again.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.469
People just naturally gravitate to him.

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.398
He's like your brother,
or your cousin,

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:38.072
or your neighbor,
or the guy next door.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.969
He's just approachable.

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:42.406
Everybody feels like
they know him.

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.102
Like he's accessible.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.575
Even the kids that come in here.

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.252
When he's in here,
they go right up to him.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.422
They're not intimidated
by his size or anything else.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:56.319
We tease him, we say, "Well,
that's your peer group."

01:19:56.525 --> 01:20:00.292
How are you, sweetie? You all
right? Long time, no see.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.555
Yeah. You actually did shave.

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:04.790
I did shave. Come here.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.628
- How are you?
- Good.

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.963
- How's school treating you?
- Good.

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.606
- Yes? You learning?
- Yup.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.106
- Can we get a picture with you?
- Done!

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.770
Come on.
You want to sit on my leg?

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.979
Oh! You might be
a little heavy now for me.

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:27.788
Ready, Mia?
One, two, three... Yay!

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.150
Insurance shot.

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:33.857
You ready? Let me finish
a couple things, then we'll go.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:35.462
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Dirk.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.030
We'll see you soon.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.769
I heard you're
a Chicago Bulls fan.

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:44.701
- Can we change that?
- It's going to be hard.

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:47.102
Can you like the Mavericks
a little bit, just a little?

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:50.643
I do like them a little bit. I
liked it when you beat the Heat.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.371
I hate the Heat.

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:59.117
He's been spokesperson for the
Children's Cancer Fund out of L.A.

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:04.726
His foundation is for the benefit
and wellness of children.

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.986
- No!
- Oh! You blocked it.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.960
At Christmas his family
is usually here,

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:13.465
and we decide how those funds
are going to be dispersed.

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:15.660
Try to guard that, my friend.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.033
This is for the Chicago Bulls.

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:22.841
I'm not so much
proud of Dirk as a basketball player,

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:27.382
I'm more proud of him as a son.

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:31.041
To me, that means he's
got both feet on the ground,

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:33.688
he shows respect,

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:38.723
he's not conceited
because of his money.

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:41.829
I really like what a
social person he is.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.269
Of course
there are a lot of offers,

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.778
young ladies with signs,
"Dirk, marry me!"

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:02.246
and lots of other variations.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.716
The temptations are great.

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:07.921
And everyone has to
decide for themselves

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:10.215
how to deal with that.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:11.683
But it's difficult.

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.196
According to reports,

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:25.238
Nowitzki had lived here
for a year with Cristal Taylor.

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:30.207
They were allegedly engaged,
he'd introduced her to his parents...

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:34.946
The special thing here
was that people around him

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:37.779
asked him, "Are you sure
this is what you want?"

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:40.915
And Dirk, who in the past

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:43.284
often accepted advice
before making decisions,

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:46.655
particularly from
his family and Holger,

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.390
in this case he said,

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:54.001
"I take responsibility for the
decision, and I'm making it alone."

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:57.172
They wanted to marry,
the date was set,

01:22:57.372 --> 01:23:01.434
preparations had to be made.
And I started googling,

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:04.738
checking out the name
and the rest of it...

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:10.078
At some point we discovered she'd
been a wanted person for some time.

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.481
New information about
the story CBS 11 broke earlier today.

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:16.180
This involves a woman arrested
at the home of Dirk Nowitzki.

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.417
Cristal Taylor
is in the Dallas county jail

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:20.151
after federal and local authorities

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:23.332
converged on Nowitzki's house in
an upscale Dallas neighborhood.

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:27.366
Sources say a private investigator
working for Nowitzki was involved.

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:28.764
Authorities have uncovered

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:31.371
at least eight different aliases
used by Taylor.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.210
It's tragic when
your trust is disappointed like that.

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.775
And when that comes out,

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.384
and she tries everything,
says she's pregnant...

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:45.516
Very complicated.

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:55.457
It's indescribable,
to be living with someone...

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:59.960
You thought you knew the person,
but in the end,

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:02.797
it turns out it's not the person

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:06.031
you know and have come to love.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.007
How do you deal with that?

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:12.806
Do you join a monastery,
become celibate? Of course not.

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:15.176
But another relationship?

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:18.842
Is it about me as a player,
or as a rich guy in Dallas?

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:22.718
That's why it's so important
to have friends and family.

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:26.224
And Dirk has Holger,
who he can count on,

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.397
and who'll break his fall.

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:33.497
So we thought, where can you go
where you're not easily reached?

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:38.571
Let's do Australia, New Zealand,
the South Pacific. We got a Jeep,

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:42.733
drove to Alice Springs,
got some supplies,

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:46.278
made campfires in the evening
and so on. It was great.

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:50.780
And in New Zealand, since Dirk
is a huge fan of "The Hobbit."

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:54.854
We bought a map
of all the film locations,

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:59.126
dug out pools on the beach
above hot springs...

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:01.123
We kept to ourselves.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.927
For me the main thing was,

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:09.195
if you've been so disappointed,
you might close the door

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:13.097
and never trust anyone again...
That was the main danger.

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:16.807
They go on vacation together
and do stuff where I think:

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:21.981
You've got better things to do
than traveling through Asia

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.584
with an old guy
who never changes his clothes.

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.647
Nope.
It worked well.

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:49.077
Me and my buddy go to Dallas,

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:53.245
and he says, "Let's play
tennis this afternoon."

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:57.476
"Who is our fourth man?"
"My tennis partner," he says.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:01.323
An attractive woman
in tennis gear turns up.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:05.184
Dirk doesn't say,
"This is my new girlfriend."

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:08.761
He says, "my tennis partner."
I had to laugh.

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:11.193
J.W. was sitting having a beer

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:13.468
and I was heading back
towards the bedroom,

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.363
I think I was about to change,

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.095
and he said,
"Are you about to leave?"

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:20.274
I said, "No, I'm just going
to go get ready for bed."

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:23.035
And I said, "Hey, Jessica,

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.509
that's your car to the right there."

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:32.778
So that was
my first meeting with J.W.

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:35.547
and, you know,
the joker that he is.

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:38.488
So it was obvious
she was his girlfriend,

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:42.721
but he was too cowardly to introduce her
as his girlfriend, and says to me:

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:45.231
"My tennis partner is coming!"

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:52.974
I thought it'd take him longer
to get over it,

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.369
but...

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:57.710
...she's a fantastic woman,

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.678
what a terrific catch!

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:08.489
He's a humble, down-to-earth,

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.919
kind, but very funny guy.

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:14.095
He's funny

01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:19.097
in his sense of humor,
and he takes life very easily.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:24.068
And, you know, we sort of
connect on that level.

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:49.420
It was clear that he
could give it his all with that team,

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:52.233
but success was unlikely.

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:56.363
And according to NBA regulations,

01:27:56.571 --> 01:28:01.202
he could have had 96 million,
what the Americans call max-out.

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:04.044
I said, 80 million is
still a pile of dough.

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:07.576
That a player comes and says,
I'll forego the money

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.877
so we can get better players
and win the title...

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:15.588
This was before anyone knew they
were playing for the championship.

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.156
That's extremely unusual.

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:19.589
He didn't take that
much less. Let's not put it that far.

01:28:19.827 --> 01:28:23.229
He's still getting paid
19, 20, 21, 22 million a year.

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:25.161
So let's not plead poverty
for Dirk.

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:27.767
Not to take anything away
from Dirk. He's a team guy.

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:30.564
We bring in much different guys.

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:31.967
Then it gets toward
the end of the season,

01:28:32.173 --> 01:28:34.165
we go on a West Coast road trip

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.276
and we lose like six in a row.

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:40.403
And everybody's like, "These guys
are toast. There's no chance".

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.277
But we literally
going into the playoffs

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.315
were not playing our best basketball.

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.249
We get to Portland...

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:48.686
Nowitzki, fading.

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:54.526
Not a good possession.

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.125
Nowitzki at the other end.

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:01.992
Then we go to play
the defending champs, the Lakers.

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.103
And literally everybody's like,

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.001
"They got no chance.
They're the defending champs."

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:09.806
Nowitzki drives on Gasol, stops.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.980
Left-handed! Puts it up and in.

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.374
What a shot for Nowitzki!

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:17.374
This is Dirk Nowitzki
at his best this year.

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:23.514
Twenty five point lead
for the Mavericks.

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:31.298
I remember Dirk in the locker
room saying to everybody,

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:35.732
"I've been up,
the Miami series, and lost it.

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:39.374
So let's not get too excited or too
giddy, we've got to stay focused."

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.740
And we came back to Dallas
and just whooped them.

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.502
For the fourth
time in franchise history

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:46.977
the Dallas Mavericks are going to
the Western Conference Finals.

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:50.049
There will be
a new champion in the NBA.

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.711
They beat us handily
in the postseason.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.713
After our series I knew they had

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:57.585
an amazing shot at
winning the championship

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:00.158
because they had the talent,

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:04.862
they had the chemistry and
the camaraderie to get it done.

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:08.764
I think the Dallas Mavericks'
2011 team was a family.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:12.435
When you talk about guys
being able to hang out,

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:16.843
you talk about our superstar
as a low-maintenance guy,

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:20.037
never wanting attention,
just wanting to win,

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.944
and to be able to

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:25.448
finally reach the mountaintop
by winning a championship.

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:29.249
Brought everybody closer together in
a bond that will always be together.

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.960
Nowitzki. Wow, big three!

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.192
Falling away...
Oh, he puts it in!

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:42.199
Dirk Nowitzki knocks it down.

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.929
And he dunked it!
How many times?

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:48.303
And the Dallas Mavericks are
going back to the NBA Finals.

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:50.236
If you think about it,

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.312
when somebody steals
your girlfriend or your bicycle

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.915
in high school,
it's usually gone forever.

01:30:56.851 --> 01:31:00.310
So for us to go back
and to be in that place,

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:07.952
where it was so difficult
for us a few years earlier,

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:10.791
was a very, very unique
and special opportunity.

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:20.307
Wade...
alley-oop to James!

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:23.568
There's the exclamation point.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:28.446
...as the Miami Heat take
Game One of the NBA Finals.

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.476
And the Mavericks fighting back.

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.914
Nowitzki puts it up...
Knocks it in!

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.352
Here goes Marion
back to Nowitzki.

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:38.958
Lefty layup, banks it in
and the game is tied!

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.152
Dallas has tied the Finals,

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:44.992
with one of the most incredible
comebacks in NBA Finals history.

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:47.764
Wade, 30-foot three... No good!

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.631
It's over, it's over.

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:52.466
And the Mavericks
have stolen Game Two!

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:55.370
Nowitzki, back-door, tie game!

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.845
Nowitzki spins,
head fake, falling away...

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:03.140
Shot won't go, and Miami
holds on and takes Game Three.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:04.375
He's going too early!

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:06.712
Drives underneath.
Layup, he puts it in!

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:08.787
Nowitzki makes it
a three-point game.

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:11.186
Wade lost the ball,
throws to the backcourt,

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:13.657
gets it to Miller,
Miller puts it up...

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:16.524
Air ball! And that's it!

01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:18.996
Nowitzki quick move,
and the finish!

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:26.841
What a performance from
the veteran Dallas Mavericks.

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:29.875
Win, lose or draw,
the next two games in Miami.

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:32.740
This team has flat out deserved

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:36.008
the recognition
and the applause of everyone.

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:38.914
If you spend any time
around him and you know

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.882
how much he suffered after 2006.

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:44.854
I think a lot of people in
the NBA, not just in Dallas,

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:47.392
I think a lot of people
all over the league,

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:50.861
were really rooting for Dirk
to get that championship.

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.533
He was so geared up,

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:54.361
couldn't give more.

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:57.937
"I don't want people to fly in

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:01.001
and up the ante and so on."

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:05.402
So of course it was difficult
for us to accept that.

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:09.914
"You came last time,
it went bad, we ended up losing.

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:14.587
I'd like to stick to my routine
from the first two months."

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:19.719
That was when only Holger was there
throughout the play-offs.

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:55.125
...that's the way to shoot for it.

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:56.922
Nowitzki puts it up...

01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:00.124
Puts it in! Nowitzki makes it
a ten-point lead.

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.170
Here's Kidd. Five to shoot.

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:09.139
To the cutting Dirk, down the lane...
Yes, there it is!

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:12.973
There it is! The Mavericks are
going to win the championship!

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.615
They lead by 11,
the arms up in the air!

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:26.123
And it's 103-92.

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:28.694
And that should do it
for the Dallas Mavericks.

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:31.525
The Mavericks celebrating
on the bench.

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:40.674
For the first time ever the Dallas
Mavericks are the NBA champions.

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:44.644
They are basketball's best
in 2011.

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:11.365
I saw Dirk through the corner
of my eye leave the gym.

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:15.809
It reminded me of Michael Jordan the
first time he won the championship.

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:20.012
I mean, he broke down.
He was extremely emotional.

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:22.376
I looked up in the crowd
and I saw Holger.

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:24.576
And I saw a tear in his eye.

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:29.385
And I know, I've never talked
to Holger about this,

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:34.858
but I know that was the final
chapter of the journey.

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:41.426
And so my feelings were this...
Grateful.

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:48.770
He didn't want
to share his emotion publicly.

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:52.435
And he's a private guy
when it comes to his emotions

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:56.242
and things he does off the court,
he likes to keep things private.

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:58.078
That's just who he is.

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:01.744
But I think it was just
overwhelming for him to understand

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:04.448
that he finally won
a championship.

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.438
When they did it,

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:21.200
it was 5 a.m., and I got in
my car, went to my daughter's,

01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:23.871
and we celebrated.

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:35.756
I was very
happy for him, to see him do that.

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.152
I know he had worked
extremely hard.

01:36:38.359 --> 01:36:41.887
I know he had some struggles the
first time he was in an NBA Finals.

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:45.464
And he wanted to get back to
that place to redeem himself.

01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:47.794
I was very happy for him
when he did.

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:51.063
It was really
the first time in NBA history

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:55.101
that the best player,
that was foreign-born,

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:59.237
that had never had any development
in high school or college,

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:01.141
won a championship.

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:03.476
So Dirk was clearly
the best player on our team.

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:08.316
He was the focal point, and he
led us to a championship.

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:10.451
Legendary, for sure.

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:14.992
His name will be remembered by
people even 50 years from now.

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:20.132
People probably don't know,
in 2006,

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:23.634
when they lost Game Six here, at
the American Airlines Center,

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:27.171
Dirk and some of the people

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:30.003
that are in his circle
within the organization,

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:31.975
they sat in the back

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:35.615
till the wee hours of the morning,
five, six in the morning.

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:37.045
They couldn't leave.

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:41.518
They were so devastated to lose
that finals, they couldn't leave.

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:44.658
And I think Dirk carried that
hurt with him for five years.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:48.728
And to finally win and get
that off your shoulder...

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.288
To get that off your shoulders

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:55.868
is a feeling that normal people
like you and me can't understand.

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.835
Whether
I can reach that level again?

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:01.406
Very hard... it was...

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.841
I have to say,
I played well then.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:25.264
One, two, three!

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:29.401
♪ We are the champions ♪

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:33.601
♪ We are the champions ♪

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:37.505
♪ No time for losers ♪

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:42.206
♪ 'Cause we are the champions ♪

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:45.916
It was a time I'll never forget.

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.918
The city was a madhouse.

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:51.388
The parade, with 250,000
people on the streets.

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.960
I stood on the balcony
of the American Airline Center

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:57.222
and sang "We are the Champions,"

01:38:57.932 --> 01:39:00.231
It still gives me goose bumps.

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.426
Dirk joined
the Mavericks 13 years ago

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:05.037
as a skinny kid from Germany,

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:08.107
with what he describes
as a "goofy" haircut.

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:12.778
I think it's fair to say
that we have very rarely seen

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:17.979
a better playoff run than
Dirk Nowitzki had last year.

01:39:18.185 --> 01:39:19.915
It was remarkable.

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:25.257
So clearly Dirk is a tough guy,

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.895
although the most painful thing

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:30.792
may have been his rendition
of "We are the Champions"

01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:33.265
during the victory celebration.

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:35.561
- That was um...
- I worked on it.

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:39.504
You said you worked on that?
Seriously?

01:39:39.707 --> 01:39:40.731
Okay.

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:44.135
To me, appearing in public

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:46.644
is difficult. I'm really

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:50.579
a guy who doesn't like
a big hullabaloo.

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:54.945
And speaking in public, too.
I was so bad at first.

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:58.326
I could manage one sentence,
more or less.

01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:01.254
Then I'd try to sit down
as quickly as possible.

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:04.159
Being the center of attention...

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:08.692
Other people like it,
but I never did.

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:13.133
For me,
ceremonies and being honored

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.502
are almost a bit embarrassing.

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:17.268
Ten-time All-Star...

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:24.781
2007 league MVP,

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.851
2011 Finals MVP...

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:38.397
One day soon we'll have a statue in
front of the AAC, without question.

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:40.992
The greatest player
in Mavericks history.

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.635
Dirk Nowitzki.

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:10.186
Champ, Champ, Champ...
What day is it, Champ?

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:11.865
Dirk Nowitzki!

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:15.331
Thank you very much.

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:28.009
It's crazy,
if you think about it:

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.717
I'm pretty good

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:34.750
at throwing a ball
into a basket,

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:36.548
because I'm nine feet tall.

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:38.225
What is my NBA nickname?"

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:41.589
Your NBA nickname is
"The Dunking Deutschman."

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:47.567
But there are a thousand other people

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:51.136
who are as good at
what they do as I am

01:41:51.905 --> 01:41:53.373
who nobody knows.

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.566
I would've
also accepted these ones.

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:56.971
"Dirk Diggler."

01:41:58.846 --> 01:42:00.474
"The German Wunderkind."

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:02.816
"The Germinator."

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:08.889
It's a bit unreal,
people wanting my autograph,

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:13.488
or my photograph because
I'm good at shooting hoops.

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:28.502
"The 7-foot Schnitzel."

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.604
Hey!

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.449
That sweater stinks!

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:38.008
He's had it on for a few months.

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:39.953
"The Berlin Tall."

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.655
"Super Strudel."

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:45.155
"Kaiser von Dunkin' Slammin'."

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:49.024
During Halloween one year
I sort of threw it out there to him

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:50.925
because they were going
for a Halloween party

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:54.192
and he sort of asked, "What should I
be?" And I just said, How about...

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:58.195
Martina Navratilova?

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:01.102
He said,
"Done! Just go get me a skirt."

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:11.045
"Der Dunkin' Schnitzel."

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.351
"Der Dribblemeister."

01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:17.655
- And "Der Dunkin' Meister."
- Very nice.

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:40.976
Oh, he's so nice.

01:43:41.415 --> 01:43:44.476
So nice.
Two students came by,

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:49.849
looking for a bakery
here in Rattelsdorf.

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:54.893
"The Three Old Ladies." That was in
the newspaper they showed us.

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:59.824
I said to Dirk,
"What's this about old ladies?"

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:03.826
He said,
"I meant it in a good way."

01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:07.670
Yeah, great.

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:16.172
It was nice.
