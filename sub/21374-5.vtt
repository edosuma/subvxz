WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:12.011
[Maleke] Valedictorian...

00:12.095 --> 00:14.056
[Tim] I wonder how Coach Stephens was
in high school.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.598
[Maleke] A mean fucker.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.517
[all laugh]

00:17.600 --> 00:20.270
[Maleke] Son, I bet Coach Stephens,
they outside playing kickball,

00:20.353 --> 00:22.230
they bounce the ball over his head and--

00:22.314 --> 00:23.940
[Tim imitates Buddy]
Motherfucker, do it again!

00:24.023 --> 00:25.317
[all laugh]

00:26.151 --> 00:28.236
[imitating Buddy]
I'm gonna kick you in your dick!

00:28.320 --> 00:29.946
[Tim] That motherfucker hit me first!

00:30.030 --> 00:32.365
[in normal voice]
Bro, Stephens threw down them headsets

00:32.449 --> 00:34.451
about 20 times over the game, bro.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.329
-[mumbles]
-He was swinging them bitches, bro.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.247
Soon as we score,
he'll run and pick them up,

00:39.331 --> 00:41.083
put them back on the head, bro.
Get so happy.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.501
Soon as the defense get on the field,
he mad, boy.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.502
Yeah, he be like...

00:44.586 --> 00:46.963
[breathes heavily and grunts]

00:47.046 --> 00:49.841
[imitates Buddy] I oughta beat
your damn ass right about now.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.134
[all chuckle]

00:51.218 --> 00:54.596
[in normal voice] Hey, Coach Stephens
is like that dude on  Sling Blade.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.474
[imitates Buddy]
I get so damn mad, I can't turn back!

00:57.557 --> 00:58.891
[all laugh]

01:01.144 --> 01:04.647
[Buddy] I just get so tired, you know.
Yeah, I get so tired with football.

01:04.731 --> 01:09.194
You get tired of just beating
the same thing all over and over,

01:09.277 --> 01:13.073
and you get tired of, um...
I get tired of being nice.

01:14.031 --> 01:16.826
I get tired of being mean.
I get tired of being happy.

01:16.909 --> 01:18.786
I get tired of being sad.
I just get tired.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.206
You know, you get tired of the cameras.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.708
You get tired of the microphones.

01:23.791 --> 01:26.378
You know,
because I start losing my mind,

01:26.461 --> 01:29.506
and every guy with a camera
starts finding me.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.759
And hanging out... [mutters]
I can hear you now in that little speaker.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.093
[imitating cameraman] Get on Buddy.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.846
I think he's fixing to lose it.
It's into the boiling point.

01:36.929 --> 01:39.182
Here, he's fixing to blow.
He's fixing to blow!

01:39.266 --> 01:40.558
He's fixing to blow!

01:41.143 --> 01:43.145
[marching band playing]

02:08.795 --> 02:10.755
[engine whirring]

02:14.217 --> 02:16.678
[Ed Holly] Let's go! Big week!
Saturday, two o'clock. Big game!

02:16.761 --> 02:17.762
-[Williams] Go!
-[Ed Holly] Work!

02:17.845 --> 02:19.306
God gave us a great day to work.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.142
We know you gonna play hard.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.477
But can you make the play?
That's the question.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.728
Can you do your job?

02:25.812 --> 02:28.398
Go to the line, Snoop!
Just go to the line!

02:28.481 --> 02:31.401
Hey, we know what we're doing,
it's always to our sideline!

02:31.484 --> 02:33.110
You don't have to ask!

02:33.194 --> 02:36.364
Hurry up, start walking!
Let's go, hurry up! Hurry up, Kam!

02:36.948 --> 02:38.366
Let's go, son, you up!

02:38.450 --> 02:40.993
That was a frustrating
game to coach in.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.413
All of us defensively, man, just wondering

02:43.496 --> 02:48.501
what can we do to be able to stop people
when we need to stop people.

02:48.585 --> 02:52.505
Y'all need to be hustling to the ball,
hustling back to the ball. You understand?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.048
We ain't stopping running today.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.386
If you take care of me, guys,
I will take care of you. You understand?

02:58.470 --> 03:01.681
You know, we as a defensive staff,
you know, we take pride in what we do.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.808
We never wanna give up 49 points
to anybody.

03:03.891 --> 03:06.143
Wait, wait. You quit making
their ass look silly as shit

03:06.227 --> 03:08.271
and find something that fucking works.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.398
-It's punt safe!
-[Williams] Get down, go!

03:10.482 --> 03:13.401
[Buddy] Get down and go,
get down and go! Go, go, go!

03:13.485 --> 03:15.903
-[indistinct chattering]
-[Williams] Cover, cover, cover!

03:15.987 --> 03:17.447
[Ed Holly] Watch the back side!

03:18.072 --> 03:19.574
-That's all we play!
-[whistle blows]

03:19.657 --> 03:21.033
Give 'em a fucking touchdown!

03:21.117 --> 03:22.244
-[player] He said, "fuck."
-[Chauncey] What?

03:22.327 --> 03:23.160
[Snoop] He said the f-word.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.704
[Rodney] That's the first time
I heard him swear.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.706
-[Snoop] I didn't know he could.
-I don't hear him cussing.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.291
[Tim] I never heard Coach Holly
use the f-word.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.209
[player] I ain't never heard
his ass cuss.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.837
[Tim] Let's go sack these bitches.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.050
[Williams] Work your move, Tim.
Work your move, Tim.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.719
-Get good at it.
-[coach] Go, go, go!

03:42.805 --> 03:44.266
[player grunts]

03:44.349 --> 03:47.977
[Williams] Hey, Tim! Tim!
Where your move at, son?

03:49.562 --> 03:50.772
Where your move at?

03:53.358 --> 03:57.570
[Wagner]  I have not seen our defense
play like that since 2009.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.864
So I'm not sure what's going on.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.118
This group is just different
for some reason.

04:04.201 --> 04:07.789
There's just a lot of...
A lot more problems,

04:07.872 --> 04:12.085
I feel like...
on this team, and not academic problems.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.922
Just, like, mental problems.
I mean, emotional, mental issues.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.382
It's a Monday, that's what it is.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.760
[Rodney] No, it's your attitude, bro.
You gotta shake back, ya heard me.

04:21.218 --> 04:23.388
-You gotta shake back.
-[groans]

04:23.471 --> 04:26.558
[Rodney] It's all in the mind.
That's that Penn State state of mind.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.852
[Kam] Give me a reason,
and I'll fight the fuck out you.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.440
[Rodney] You gotta go out your way
to get beat up by me. Ya heard me?

04:33.523 --> 04:38.403
Yeah, you gotta go out your way.
Yo, ain't no running around here.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.487
No running around here.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.030
Really, you pussy.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.615
Pussy.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.535
But everybody's a gangster
in pads, though.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.078
That what I be saying.

04:47.662 --> 04:52.083
[Wagner]  Every year, up until this point,
there is like a brotherhood almost.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.252
And I'm not really getting that
with this team,

04:54.336 --> 04:55.545
especially the D-line.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.841
I feel like there's a lot of stuff
going on within the D-line.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.510
And maybe that's where
the breakdown is on the field.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.679
I don't know, but not good.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.098
And if we don't play
better this week on defense,

05:07.181 --> 05:08.891
we will not beat Northwest.

05:12.019 --> 05:13.270
[Stringer] In measure three...

05:14.856 --> 05:19.110
[in sing-song] One, two, three,
ta, dotted half note.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.654
Quarter, dotted half note.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.824
Quarter, whole, two, three and off.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.659
Very simple.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.079
Can I hear it, please?
One, two, ready, and...

05:30.163 --> 05:31.914
[band playing Awolnation's "Sail"]

05:48.515 --> 05:49.641
[inaudible]

05:50.850 --> 05:54.937
[radio host]  A game of enormous
implications Saturday afternoon,

05:55.021 --> 05:58.733
as number one travels to number four
in Scooba to face East Mississippi.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.694
What a great beacon for the league

06:01.778 --> 06:04.030
to have number one
and number four this late in the year

06:04.113 --> 06:07.033
going at it for a national championship,
wouldn't you agree?

06:07.116 --> 06:09.619
The biggest game
we'll play all year. [chuckles]

06:09.702 --> 06:11.996
Just gonna do a lot of determining.
Just like...

06:12.079 --> 06:14.666
"Hey, buddy,
we're still number one." [chuckles]

06:14.749 --> 06:16.125
[band continues playing]

06:16.918 --> 06:18.377
[Stringer]  We've gotta beat Northwest.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.130
If we don't do that, forget it.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.426
I think we'll beat this number one team.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.677
We should be number one after that.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.390
If you can beat number one,
and you're number four,

06:30.473 --> 06:33.601
then you're gonna get to play
for a national championship.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.853
[Rodney] Y'all saying we got a shot
to make the championship?

06:35.937 --> 06:37.021
Yeah, we do.

06:37.104 --> 06:38.815
Not the state,
I'm talking about the national.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.650
We gotta win the fuck out, son.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.151
[band continues playing]

06:48.032 --> 06:50.159
I don't know.
I mean, I think they're pretty good.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.871
It's a good team.
I wish our defense was a bit stronger.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.957
But it's a good team.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.667
[Williams] This ain't no ordinary week.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.044
This is a big-time game.

07:00.127 --> 07:03.130
And the weakness that they have
is their offensive line.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.175
-Do you understand?
-[player] Mm-hmm.

07:06.258 --> 07:09.303
With the talent
that we got in this room, okay...

07:10.262 --> 07:12.348
I'm raising the expectation bar high.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.852
You gotta step up. You gonna step up.

07:16.143 --> 07:19.105
It's gonna be up to you
to step up to the challenge.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.607
I can sit up here
and drill you all day, guys.

07:21.899 --> 07:25.069
But sacks,
it's nothing but an effort play.

07:25.152 --> 07:28.030
It ain't what you doing,
it ain't what move you working,

07:28.114 --> 07:29.574
it's an effort play.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.493
Very first play of the game.

07:32.159 --> 07:33.244
Just get off.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.872
Hey, Tim Bonner, you mean to tell me
that guy quicker than you?

07:36.456 --> 07:40.960
Son, I am challenging you.
I am challenging you, Tim.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.796
You got the quickest get off in here
out of everybody in this room.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.465
-Of course.
-[player chuckles]

07:45.548 --> 07:48.092
[Williams] You mean to tell me
you can't do this?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.888
I believe you can,
over and over and over and over.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.431
But it ain't about me believing it, son.
It's about you.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.435
It's about you believing
that you can do it.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.272
[Johnson]  Your nickname should be
"Can't Get It Right."

08:02.398 --> 08:04.025
[Tim] That's what they used to call me
at Louisville

08:04.108 --> 08:06.819
when I had to play linebacker
during the damn linebacker drill.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.070
[Johnson] "Can't Get It Right"?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.615
Yeah, Jay bird, he had named me
"Can't Get It Right."

08:10.698 --> 08:13.910
-'Cause you can't do it right.
-Can't do nothing in the drill right.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.663
[Tim]  I need to get way more better
than I'm doing now

08:16.746 --> 08:18.873
'cause I ain't got no sacks.
I need to get some sacks.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.543
'Cause I'm labeled as a speed rusher
to the D-I coaches.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.754
Like, they won't...
They like to see me sack the quarterbacks.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.965
So that what they recruited me for,
to rush the quarterback.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.553
[Johnson] Kam, 5:30. [claps] You ready?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.262
Kam ain't on... Oh, that is Kam.

08:33.345 --> 08:35.014
Damn, I didn't know you was on here.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.142
[Johnson] Yeah, me and Kam
got us a date with class.

08:38.475 --> 08:40.687
I might even come in there
and sit beside you, Kam.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.021
[Tim]  I graduate in May.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.982
Since football gonna be over with,
I wanna be mostly focused on my grades.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.276
Since I'm having free time,
I'mma do a lot of studying.

08:47.359 --> 08:49.737
If I wasn't playing football,
I don't know what I'd be doing.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.447
I don't know where I'd be at right now.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.450
But playing football got me in school.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.118
And so that's how that happened.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.498
[Willie]  You know, Tim always said...
He never talk about working anywhere.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.834
Tim only talked about
playing pro football.

09:04.126 --> 09:07.213
You know, that was what he did,
that's what he talked about.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.137
[man] That's his dream,
to make it to the NFL.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.556
[Willie] That's all he talk about.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.308
You know what Tim told me
when he get to the NFL?

09:19.391 --> 09:22.979
He gonna buy a double-wide trailer
and an old-school Cutlass.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.523
-[both laugh]
-[Willie] I said, "You can do better."

09:25.607 --> 09:27.567
[laughing]

09:28.526 --> 09:29.652
[man] Hey--

09:30.361 --> 09:32.572
[Willie laughs] An old-school car
with no rims on it.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.156
[man] Oh, yeah. An old car.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.701
[Jesse]  It would mean a lot.
He'll be the first

09:36.784 --> 09:39.495
to even have any of this
to happen, you know, so...

09:39.579 --> 09:42.206
He did enough already, if you ask me.

09:42.289 --> 09:45.459
Man, I tell you, Tim been an inspiration
to a lot of people, man.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.419
-[Jesse] He is.
-[man] Everybody loves him.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.463
[Willie] He's an inspiration
to a lot of people.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.258
I sure hope
he pulls this thing off 'cause...

09:52.884 --> 09:55.302
he deserve it, man.
He done put a lot in it, man.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.721
[Willie] Yes, sir. A lot of years.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.599
[Jesse] Playin' football
for a long time, man.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.892
[Tim Causey]  God put Tim
on this planet to play football.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.730
And when he's not doing that,
he's bored stiff.  [chuckles]

10:06.314 --> 10:08.482
Just a teenage boy
with a lot of energy, man.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.652
What a great game to be a part of
if you got energy and you that size.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.738
-[both chuckle]
-And love contact.

10:13.821 --> 10:17.033
[Pitts]  He was aggressive,
he was violent and he made you pay.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.951
[Causey]  I felt sorry for the quarterback

10:19.035 --> 10:20.244
'cause he couldn't get away.

10:20.327 --> 10:22.538
[Pitts]  You could really let him
cut his motor loose.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.041
-And we were gonna get a sack.
-He had a ton that year, too.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.458
Five, six times a game.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.794
-He had a ton of sacks that year.
-Yeah.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.087
[man]  I got a chance
to coach against him at Wilcox.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.132
Everything I was gearin'
was trying to get away from him.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.385
Run away from him. Run away from him.
And it still didn't work.

10:36.468 --> 10:37.929
[Jesse] Yeah,
'cause he don't use his hand.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.097
-It's raw talent!
-[Jesse] He don't use his hands.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.933
I'm telling you,
when he comes off the line,

10:42.016 --> 10:45.812
he has nothing but speed and power,
'cause he ain't got no moves right now.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.064
-[Jesse] He ain't use his hands.
-He ain't got no moves.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.524
He's just coming off the line,
wanting the ball.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.069
[Willie]  I know Tim wanna be a baller,

10:53.152 --> 10:56.030
but he gotta get his technique down first,
you know.

10:56.113 --> 10:59.075
You just can't go after the quarterback,
it's a technique you gotta have.

10:59.158 --> 11:03.245
And he said it was just hard
for him to get to that mode.

11:03.704 --> 11:08.209
But only somebody can really stop Tim
from what he doing now is Tim.

11:16.092 --> 11:20.137
[Williams]  Tim, you know, he got into
a situation really early at Louisville

11:20.221 --> 11:22.514
so he had very minimum time on the field.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.976
So the things
that he would be going through

11:25.059 --> 11:26.894
as a redshirt freshman
at four-year school,

11:26.978 --> 11:28.229
he's going through now.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.108
You know, you fail, you fail, you fail.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.610
You know, you get down a little bit,
you know.

11:34.693 --> 11:38.114
He never gotten over that hump
of failing and being conquered.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.743
And I think the lack of confidence
has kind of hindered him

11:41.826 --> 11:45.412
from listening and trying.

11:47.164 --> 11:51.127
If we have his skill set on Saturday,
and he's playing at 100%,

11:51.210 --> 11:53.712
we won't have any problems
stopping the pass.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.132
That's how much I believe
in this young man.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.727
[Williams] Uh, see this?
This is the reason why we're rolling.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.979
'Cause I'm sick of it.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.898
Now you see it. We go through
walk throughs and we get it

12:12.982 --> 12:15.985
and we get out of here,
it's just like we lose our freaking mind.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.237
This happen in the game,
you know what I mean,

12:18.320 --> 12:19.864
somebody gonna be in trouble.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.533
It's probably gonna be me.

12:22.867 --> 12:23.909
And me.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.704
[chuckles] Oh, come on, that's funny.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.706
[chuckles] I mean, I don't think...
Nah, it ain't funny, man.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.334
When you rep something with these guys
and they don't get it.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.296
[Ed Holly] Yeah, I got you.
All right, you see Tim come down?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.713
They're gonna pick up that blitz.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.550
[stammers] It's the looper right here,
and that's Snoop...

12:39.633 --> 12:41.343
-Ah, come on, Snoop.
-You know, he's just...

12:41.427 --> 12:44.346
Everything with him
is five minutes behind.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.098
[Ed Holly] He's just a baby.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.724
[coach] Get your eyes up, Snoop.

12:47.809 --> 12:52.021
Play the guard. Press, Snoop.
Get in there, Snoop! Rip in there, Snoop!

12:52.104 --> 12:54.648
-Snoop, you gotta get out your stance!
-[whistle blowing]

12:54.731 --> 12:57.568
-Snoop, get out your stance!
-[Rodney] Sink back, Snoop.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.487
You act like you don't know the play.
Tell 'em. Go on, tell the world.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.864
-Tell 'em.
-I forgot the play.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.991
Yeah. And we just went over 'em.

13:04.075 --> 13:07.119
We just went over the plays and I forgot.
My bad.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.913
[Williams]  Snoop is still
behind the eight ball,

13:08.996 --> 13:10.706
especially now that we are in the season,

13:10.789 --> 13:15.086
we have to focus on those guys
who are ahead of 'em.

13:15.169 --> 13:18.130
We've been in the sideline watching
Snoop the whole time, bro.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.966
They be tearin' his ass up, bro.
[chuckles]

13:20.049 --> 13:23.010
[Maleke] If you don't straighten up,
your ass ain't going nowhere next year

13:23.094 --> 13:25.972
or the year after that,
but back to Canton.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.474
[player] Nah, your ass got till the spring
to straighten up.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.060
Hell yeah,
that what I told you the other day.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.686
But it ain't enough for you to sit there

13:32.769 --> 13:35.314
'cause they can get a motherfucker
out of high school for that.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.233
This is like legit college, bro.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.568
You gotta go out and play
or get your ass killed.

13:39.651 --> 13:40.819
[Chauncey] It's not that
you undisciplined,

13:40.903 --> 13:42.696
you just don't know what the fuck to do.

13:42.779 --> 13:44.866
Hey, I didn't know
what the fuck to do at high school.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.993
That when they told me,
"Go out there, make plays."

13:47.076 --> 13:48.244
All right, that's what done.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.287
That's what I'm saying.
You sit, watch film,

13:50.371 --> 13:52.831
and they teach you.
Why the fuck you still don't do the shit?

13:53.415 --> 13:54.917
You scared you gonna hurt somebody?

13:56.878 --> 13:58.212
[Maleke] Probably what it is, huh?

13:58.295 --> 14:01.924
We just need to, before every game,
punch the fuck out of Snoop.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.218
Now, at my high school,
we had a nigga just like you.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.802
Soft as fuck, but you was strong, bro.

14:05.887 --> 14:09.306
Every practice, my coaches be like,
"Try to hit this nigga in the mouth."

14:09.390 --> 14:11.683
Snoop be out there fumblin'-bumblin'.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.810
-[Maleke] And strong as fuck.
-[Chauncey] Strong as a motherfucker.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.729
-[Tim chuckles] Strong as fuck.
-[Chauncey] Soft as shit.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.691
[Maleke] He big country strong too, bro.

14:19.191 --> 14:23.404
I told you, Snoop just...
His body grew too big for his mind.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.531
-[all laughing]
-Snoop be like...

14:27.241 --> 14:29.826
-"The fuck going on?"
-[all laughing]

14:31.537 --> 14:33.664
[Glenda] Maleke was talking
about you earlier.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.416
-What he say?
-Said all you do is smile and laugh.

14:35.499 --> 14:38.252
Somebody can talk about you, joke,
and you're not gonna do a thing but laugh.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.213
That laugh right there, then smile,
that's all you gonna do.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.549
Me and my dad just got
into a fight, like, two months ago.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.010
That was one moment
you really didn't want to talk to me.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.262
To this day, like...
If I see my dad, now, I'll...

14:48.345 --> 14:51.307
I'll put him in his place, for real.
It wouldn't be the first time I did.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.935
Ain't gotta put a grown man in his place.
He already in his place.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.019
No, not really.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.396
No, I'mma put him in his place, um,

14:57.479 --> 14:59.857
how he should show
more respect to his son.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.402
So he didn't come see you
in any of your games or anything?

15:03.485 --> 15:05.821
Oh, no. Even my... This man...

15:05.905 --> 15:08.824
-He missed your graduation and everything?
-He missed everything.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.994
He came to my brother graduation,
but he ain't come to mine.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.121
He came to my...
He came to my sister graduation,

15:14.205 --> 15:16.958
they graduated the year before me.
Didn't come to mine.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.544
He went to all their graduations.
Didn't come to mine.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.172
[woman speaking indistinctly]

15:23.255 --> 15:24.798
[Kam chuckles] Hey, Tim.

15:24.881 --> 15:27.009
-Remember you was scared of me, bro?
-[Tim] Hmm?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.677
[Kam] This man used to be scared of me.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.305
All right. Hold on.
No, no, no, I wasn't scared, no.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.474
When this big,
dumb motherfucker first came here,

15:34.058 --> 15:35.851
I saw that nigga, I said,
"There's a big mofo,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.062
I ain't gonna fuck with him
for real like that."

15:38.145 --> 15:40.982
When I heard him talk,
"Oh, that bitch retarded."

15:41.065 --> 15:43.775
-I started fighting his ass...
-[all laugh]

15:43.859 --> 15:46.778
[chuckles] When I heard
that motherfucker talk, it was over with.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.905
[student] What made
you come down here?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.324
'Cause I got in trouble.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.620
[Tim] If anybody from a university
got in trouble...

15:55.787 --> 15:57.456
I'm trying to go close to my mom.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.126
My mom never seen me play football.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.046
-[Tim] Where your mama stay at? Georgia?
-Mm-hmm.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.090
Not one day, bro.
Never seen me play.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.341
[Tim] For real?

16:08.384 --> 16:11.595
Only if you knew Kam's real background...

16:12.179 --> 16:13.889
[Kam] Hey, chill the fuck out, dude.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.682
I ain't finna say nothing.
That's why I said,

16:15.766 --> 16:17.726
"Only if you knew."
I ain't finna say nothing.

16:17.809 --> 16:19.311
[Kam] Chill the fuck out, nigga.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.566
-What's wrong with him?
-[student] I don't know.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.777
[Kam] I'm going UGA, nigga.
So I can go home, nigga.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.612
I'm talking close to home.

16:28.695 --> 16:30.697
[student talking indistinctly]

16:36.328 --> 16:38.539
[student] Pull your pants up, Kam!

16:43.127 --> 16:46.922
[Latoya]  We were young teenagers,
14 and 15.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.550
I was petrified.

16:49.633 --> 16:55.097
I did not know about pregnancy
and stuff like that, you know.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.516
And I was hiding it, of course.

16:57.599 --> 17:01.853
I didn't want my mom to find out
or my uncles or my family members.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.980
So, for a long time I hid it.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.775
Until it was just no more hiding.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.486
[chuckles]  It's like,
this is what's going on.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.031
I ended up having a cesarean section,
thank God.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.366
Because he was...
He was almost 12 pounds.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.245
He was 11 pounds, eight ounces and long.
He was huge.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.916
When he came along, I fell in love.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.919
I didn't know what love was
until I seen him.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.636
-[Kam] Damn!
-[man] That's not your ball.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.597
[Kam] I hit the...
No, I meant to hit this one.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.557
[man chuckles]

17:40.101 --> 17:42.728
Come on, man. Why the fuck
it ain't hit the ball how I wanted it to?

17:42.811 --> 17:43.854
[man] I won. You lost.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.022
-That's a fact. Thank you, thank you.
-[Kam] Bro. Hey!

17:46.107 --> 17:47.608
I was punishing him, Dad.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.861
Hey, he probably had, like,
five balls on the table. I had two.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.989
[man] That shot yesterday was looking off,
so no, no, no.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.032
Bro, I was tired yesterday.

17:56.117 --> 18:00.496
Your excuses are tools of the incompetent.
They build monuments of nothing.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.289
Those who specialize in their use

18:02.373 --> 18:04.250
are seldom capable
of accomplishing anything...

18:04.333 --> 18:05.459
-[woman] Here we go.
-...sir.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.877
-[laughs]
-All right?

18:06.960 --> 18:10.297
Make your excuses, and you know
you should know they're excuses,

18:10.381 --> 18:12.758
and you should know
the definition of an excuse.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.551
Or is it a reason? What is it?

18:15.051 --> 18:18.097
-It's a reason.
-It's your reason, but it's an excuse.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.890
-[Kam chuckles]
-[woman] All right.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.975
-You can make your own plate.
-[oven beeping]

18:22.058 --> 18:23.227
[Kam] Can you make me one, Ma?

18:23.310 --> 18:25.812
Hey, bro.
Don't take all the eggs, bro. Damn!

18:25.896 --> 18:28.064
[man] That right there, buddy, damn, bro!

18:28.148 --> 18:29.525
-[Kam] You didn't put cheese.
-[woman] There's not much.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.527
-[woman] I did.
-[Kam] Barely.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.488
[Latoya]  My uncle,
he stepped up and he asked me,

18:34.571 --> 18:36.072
you know, "Why don't I help you?"

18:36.157 --> 18:38.367
And to help in this young man's life

18:38.450 --> 18:41.328
because my uncle,
he was into the school board

18:41.411 --> 18:44.414
and he was into sports,
and he was into so much

18:44.498 --> 18:46.792
and he didn't have children of his own.

18:46.875 --> 18:51.797
So I made the decision to, you know,
for him to go with my uncle,

18:51.880 --> 18:54.591
but it was the hardest decision ever.

18:57.594 --> 19:01.932
[Aaron]  We just had to make the decision,
pray on it, feel good about it and...

19:03.225 --> 19:05.894
First, I think it's a blessing
to have that relationship

19:06.228 --> 19:08.814
with a father-son, you know.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.192
And me being in position to coach him,

19:11.275 --> 19:13.652
being a motivator, being a father figure,

19:14.153 --> 19:16.029
I think that had a lot to do with it.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.200
I feel like I know him well,
sometimes better than he knows himself.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.492
But, you know...

19:20.576 --> 19:23.537
I know he's a type of young man that...

19:23.620 --> 19:26.165
that really responds well
to positive energy.

19:26.248 --> 19:30.252
He has someone to give him a foundation,
which I did not have.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.754
[Kam]  He was the number one player,

19:32.838 --> 19:35.507
in the state or something like that.
Like, he... I didn't even know.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.176
[Aaron] You got tired of hearing it.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.553
"Your dad this, your dad..."
It doesn't matter.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.348
It's not my turn.
I had my day, you know,

19:42.431 --> 19:43.807
and I want your day to go further.

19:43.890 --> 19:46.435
What parent doesn't, you know?
They want the best for their child.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.687
I want you to eat better than I eat,
you know.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.439
I didn't grow up in this house,

19:50.522 --> 19:52.358
-you know, you did.
-[Kam] Mm-hmm.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.610
Now, have your family grow up
in a better house.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.696
That's what it's all about. That's just
the American dream, I guess, you know?

19:57.779 --> 19:58.780
[Kam] Yeah...

19:58.864 --> 20:00.782
So we just do what we do.
Keep pushing forward.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.539
[Latoya]  When he would go back
from the weekends with me,

20:07.623 --> 20:09.833
it would be so hard
to get him back on track

20:09.916 --> 20:13.879
because he wanted to be back with me,
you know, and his siblings.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.799
My uncle was like, "You know, well,
maybe we should put a little distance

20:17.883 --> 20:19.885
so that he'll just stay focused."

20:19.968 --> 20:21.470
So I moved to Georgia,

20:21.553 --> 20:25.766
and he was so young,
he didn't really understand, you know.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.933
It was for the best.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.811
Or none of us, really... [voice breaking]

20:31.772 --> 20:32.898
Excuse me.

20:35.150 --> 20:38.737
[stammering] I didn't know,
you know, what to do.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.783
I just wanted to help him, you know,
and I didn't know how to start.

20:44.075 --> 20:46.036
I didn't know how to start to...

20:46.119 --> 20:50.123
The process in helping my son
because I didn't understand.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.293
I was very... I was a child.

20:53.335 --> 20:57.047
It was the hardest decision
I've ever made,

20:57.339 --> 20:59.550
to leave my baby up there.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.594
But I knew he was in good hands
and he was around my family

21:02.678 --> 21:05.472
and I just knew
that my uncle had the means

21:05.556 --> 21:09.976
to help out financially and mentally

21:10.060 --> 21:14.398
because I didn't know, you know.
I didn't know what was going on at all.

21:15.607 --> 21:20.112
You know, when you go off to college,
some people are like, "Yay, I'm free!"

21:20.195 --> 21:22.238
He was more like...

21:22.323 --> 21:25.576
"I'm alone. I've been dropped off again."

21:25.659 --> 21:28.579
Going through depression,
and his mind's wondering,

21:28.662 --> 21:30.080
he's already been through so much.

21:30.163 --> 21:34.042
He tried to self-medicate, smoking weed,
and I think that he felt as if,

21:34.125 --> 21:35.794
"Well, I'm not gonna take these pills,"

21:35.877 --> 21:38.213
because he doesn't like
the sedated feeling.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.716
You know,
to walk around feeling like a zombie,

21:40.799 --> 21:42.175
trapped inside of yourself.

21:42.258 --> 21:44.720
[chuckles softly]
That's not good sometimes.

21:47.222 --> 21:50.601
When everything happened,
he got kicked out of school.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.103
He waited till the last minute
to let me know.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.939
'Cause for so long,
I've been out of the loop.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.902
But the one thing that he could say is,
"Mom, guess what? I'm coming to the South.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.529
I'm gonna be closer to you."

22:03.029 --> 22:06.783
So, he's always had to drive
to get to his mom.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.284
[sniffles] Always.

22:09.202 --> 22:12.331
Our greatest sacrifice was separation,
you know.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.916
And it's like, "Son, make it worth it.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.213
Continue to work hard so that we could say
we did this thing together.

22:20.714 --> 22:24.718
We're gonna make this...
We're gonna make this time apart matter.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.052
At all costs.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.347
This is not gonna be for nothing."

22:32.601 --> 22:34.395
[indistinct chatter]

22:34.478 --> 22:37.439
[Buddy] Sit inside. Hand set. Move, move!
Move, move!

22:37.522 --> 22:40.275
-Move! That's terrible. Terrible.
-Hey! Hey!

22:40.776 --> 22:44.405
Kam. You hopping and coming
off the damn ball. Go full speed!

22:45.406 --> 22:47.533
[Buddy] Kam. Kam. One time.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.661
You're as big as anybody out here.
You're bigger than anybody out here.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.120
You're probably the biggest.

22:52.203 --> 22:54.540
One time, I'd like for you...
Just to see you

22:54.623 --> 22:58.084
take a guy and reset his ass back here.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.377
You know, just one time.

22:59.461 --> 23:03.256
I mean, not bull rush,
but just reset his ass back here

23:03.339 --> 23:05.592
and come off full speed. Let's go!

23:06.385 --> 23:10.472
You're too dadgum big and good
to be wasting your talent.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.598
Get down!

23:12.140 --> 23:14.976
Kam is a puzzle.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.562
But the one thing about him is,

23:16.645 --> 23:19.898
if Kam thinks you care about him
and knows you care about him,

23:20.231 --> 23:22.150
he'll bend over backwards for you.

23:22.233 --> 23:24.360
But you have to stay on him, you know.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.697
He's been going in
so many different directions.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.408
You know, he's been sent
in so many different directions.

23:31.201 --> 23:35.038
Kam is, uh... Kam's a good kid.

23:37.248 --> 23:39.710
That's CJ's project child.

23:39.793 --> 23:45.006
Kam, get off the rock.
Be relentless. Be relentless.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.132
[player] Set, hit!

23:46.216 --> 23:49.470
-[Johnson] Run! Yes, run! Run!
-[whistle blows]

23:49.553 --> 23:51.805
-Yes! Yes!
-[Williams] That's how you penetrate, Kam.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.306
That's how you penetrate!

23:53.389 --> 23:55.225
Now, finish!
Run through the line and finish!

23:55.308 --> 23:56.852
Do that every damn play!

23:56.935 --> 23:58.979
-[Kam] That jumping shit worked.
-[Johnson] I told you.

23:59.062 --> 24:00.689
What'd you think,
I'm gonna come out here

24:00.772 --> 24:02.440
-and talk for no reason?
-[Kam chuckles]

24:02.524 --> 24:04.818
I don't just talk for no reason, man.

24:04.901 --> 24:08.530
Hey, jog off like champions, man.
Jog off like champions.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.825
[Chauncey]  I always worry about Kam.
Kam makes bad decisions.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.579
Sometimes when Kam gets mad,
sometimes he wants to go back home.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.498
Sometimes he don't wanna be here no more.

24:17.581 --> 24:20.667
And I'll be like,
"Kam, this your one opportunity.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.462
You gotta... Either you gonna
make something out of it,

24:24.546 --> 24:25.589
or it's gonna break you.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.009
It's not the fact
that the coaches are getting on you

24:29.092 --> 24:32.471
'cause you do some of the stuff you do,
but it's the fact that they care.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.015
They want you
to make something out of our life.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.182
You gonna be good.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.852
If I can do it and some of the other
out-of-states can do it,

24:38.935 --> 24:39.936
then you can do it.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.606
Like, we all here
trying to do the same thing

24:42.689 --> 24:46.818
and we're all here for the same reason.
Like, bro, just believe in the system.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.320
The system works. Just believe in it."

24:51.657 --> 24:53.950
That's like D-I,
when NCAA come drug test you.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.035
They'll drug test for weed.

24:55.118 --> 24:58.454
And now your university
is supposed to test up to three...

24:58.539 --> 25:00.791
Up to once every three months.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.668
Supposed to have a team test
every three months.

25:02.751 --> 25:06.296
They could have random whenever.
But you've been there, you know.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.175
You can't play with them folks,
they control your life.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.679
No, it's not that they control your life,

25:13.762 --> 25:16.389
it's just like anything else. You can't...

25:16.472 --> 25:18.934
There's certain things
you just can't do with the job

25:19.017 --> 25:20.936
or the career
that you're trying to pursue.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.020
Because you're different.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.355
You feel like you got to do drugs

25:24.439 --> 25:26.650
and you don't want to be drug tested,
then guess what?

25:26.733 --> 25:28.318
-Don't play football.
-Yeah.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.736
It's just that simple.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.322
-[player] Real simple, ain't it?
-Oh, yeah.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.490
-When you think about it.
-People make it hard, but it ain't.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.952
-It's real simple. It's real simple.
-Real simple.

25:37.035 --> 25:41.164
[man in video]  Defensive lineman
Chauncey Rivers arrested for marijuana.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.376
Typically that's not a huge deal.

25:44.459 --> 25:48.421
I mean, a large percentage
of college students, uh, you know,

25:48.504 --> 25:50.799
smoke a little bit of the sticky icky.

25:50.882 --> 25:55.095
Uh, you know,
so is the guy a serial killer? No!

25:55.345 --> 26:00.726
[stammers] But three times
in seven months this guy's been busted

26:00.809 --> 26:02.310
for weed!

26:02.393 --> 26:07.315
Uh, hello, Chauncey!
[yelling] What are you doing?

26:07.398 --> 26:09.109
[Wagner] You knew
you could lose every...

26:09.192 --> 26:10.360
-[Chauncey] I know.
-[Wagner] You knew, like,

26:10.443 --> 26:11.945
"If I fail one more drug test, I'm done."

26:12.028 --> 26:13.655
-I know.
-[Wagner] And you did it anyway.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.158
So, like, I would say,
"Okay, that means you have a problem."

26:17.242 --> 26:18.243
That's what my mama said.

26:18.326 --> 26:21.204
But you went through the treatment and
you still don't think you have a problem.

26:21.287 --> 26:24.582
I don't picture myself a drug addict,
'cause I can sit there and not smoke weed.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.919
But it's like,
"Man, let me just hit this one blunt."

26:28.629 --> 26:30.338
Then one turned into two.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.924
Bad decision after bad decision.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.552
-[Wagner] And were you doing it every day?
-[Chauncey] Yeah.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.346
[Wagner] Didn't you get caught
in your car or something?

26:38.429 --> 26:39.347
Yeah.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.057
[Wagner] What happened?

26:42.308 --> 26:44.394
It was just... [chuckles]

26:44.477 --> 26:46.229
-[Wagner] You passed out in your car?
-No.

26:46.312 --> 26:49.274
You know, I just happened to, like,
doze off for a quick...

26:50.942 --> 26:54.321
[chuckles] I don't know how.
Well, I was just...

26:54.404 --> 26:55.739
-You know?
-You just took a nap.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.117
-And then they arrest you?
-Yeah.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.451
How long were you in jail?

27:00.535 --> 27:02.704
My first two times,
it was a misdemeanor.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.706
So, I'm like,
"I'm getting out that night."

27:04.790 --> 27:07.083
I'd been in the waiting cell
for, like, five hours.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.418
They called my name and they're like,

27:08.501 --> 27:10.461
"Chauncey, you need to sign
your paperwork."

27:10.545 --> 27:12.798
So I'm like,
"Hold on, I'm staying the night?"

27:12.881 --> 27:14.966
She's like, "Oh, yeah.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.343
You actually finna, uh...
We finna book you in."

27:17.427 --> 27:19.345
I was like, "I can't go up there, bro."

27:19.429 --> 27:21.682
I ain't gonna lie to you, like,
I was scared.

27:21.765 --> 27:24.434
I've been in the holding cell before,
but I ain't been booked in,

27:24.517 --> 27:26.227
like, changed clothes and everything.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.980
I would've been so depressed,
I ain't gonna lie.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.023
[Chauncey] So I call my mama...

27:31.149 --> 27:32.442
[chuckles]

27:32.525 --> 27:36.071
So I was like, "Mama,
they say they're finna book me in."

27:37.280 --> 27:40.491
She's like...
She's like, "You gotta be strong."

27:41.367 --> 27:43.745
Man, I swear to God,
I broke down crying on that phone.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.748
I said, "They putting you on the floor
with real criminals."

27:46.832 --> 27:48.166
Like, murderers and stuff.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.460
I said I had a misdemeanor
for some marijuana,

27:50.543 --> 27:52.796
but I can't be in a jail
with a dude who killed somebody.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.548
I mean, that night was just like...
I couldn't sleep.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.134
So I finally get out, I said to my mom...

27:59.260 --> 28:01.262
"Mama, that's it."
I started crying so bad, bro.

28:02.138 --> 28:05.600
Man, you know,
folks say you can lose it all

28:05.683 --> 28:07.811
and you could lose it all so fast.

28:07.894 --> 28:11.564
I literally seen my future walk away
in six months.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.401
I can't be one of them boys, like,
you know,

28:14.484 --> 28:15.986
who threw everything away.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.570
[Wagner] How do you handle the stress?

28:17.654 --> 28:21.116
Ma Dukes, she call me.
And we just sit on the phone and talk.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.202
She understands what I'm going through.
We see eye to eye.

28:24.285 --> 28:25.829
[Ezekiel] It's a mama thing.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.123
Ma Dukes be like...
She's like the best friend.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.250
She keep it real with me.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.253
[Devaunya Rivers]
Chauncey's a suburb kid.

28:33.336 --> 28:37.048
And everything came to Chauncey easy.
Got his own car for Christmas.

28:37.132 --> 28:43.513
I was PTA, uh... booster club,
selling stuff, making stuff for the team.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.182
The all-American family.
Never had any stress.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.771
I never realized the pressures
that he was under,

28:50.854 --> 28:54.440
of him feeling that he had to be great.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.360
Somewhere along the way,
football became his job, his out,

28:57.443 --> 28:59.154
because he felt he had to make it for us.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.448
It put him in a position
to make a bad decision.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.201
[woman]  What your mama was saying?

29:06.119 --> 29:07.871
She piped up.
You know how she be in the stands.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.164
She be piped up.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.207
You can hear her?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.501
I can always hear my mama.

29:13.584 --> 29:16.129
My mama ain't never missed
a game my whole career.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.798
I'm finna call you right back.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.841
This for Ma Dukes, man.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.427
â™ª Yo!
Fuck it â™ª

29:22.510 --> 29:25.221
â™ª I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª

29:25.471 --> 29:29.142
â™ª Yo
What's a life without 'em commas? â™ª

29:29.225 --> 29:32.687
â™ª Yeah
I like bitches with no drama â™ª

29:32.771 --> 29:34.397
â™ª Yeah!
My... â™ª

29:34.480 --> 29:37.108
[chuckles] I forgot how we did it.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.819
-Say you tripping.
-Oh... What did I say?

29:38.902 --> 29:40.361
My cuz... My B.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.448
You gotta make it for Ma Dukes, though...

29:43.531 --> 29:47.535
[stammers] It ain't even, like,
not making it for your dad. It's like...

29:48.286 --> 29:50.371
Ma Dukes put a lot of work in.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.500
I'm the last child.
I'm the child she put everything into.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.877
So my mom was like,
"If you don't believe in yourself,

29:55.961 --> 29:58.754
I'mma believe in you ten times
more than you believe in yourself."

29:58.839 --> 30:02.675
Know what I'm saying? I just went to jail
three times in one year.

30:02.759 --> 30:06.054
Like, who wants a kid who went to jail
three times in one year?

30:06.554 --> 30:08.056
And she's like, "Chauncey...

30:11.226 --> 30:12.560
you can do this."

30:12.643 --> 30:14.104
â™ª For my momma â™ª

30:15.730 --> 30:18.441
â™ª For my momma
Yeah â™ª

30:18.524 --> 30:20.693
â™ª I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª

30:22.653 --> 30:23.822
Well, it's about time...

30:23.905 --> 30:25.031
-Let me hear it.
-All right.

30:25.115 --> 30:28.952
[Chauncey]  One thing
people don't know is that my mom,

30:29.035 --> 30:30.871
she went to prison for a year.

30:30.954 --> 30:34.624
And it finally comes out
that my mom did not do it.

30:34.707 --> 30:37.377
They dropped the charges,
and she just now gets outta jail for it.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.962
After a year of her life.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.422
A year of her life
that I did not see my mom.

30:41.506 --> 30:46.302
So it's, like, when me and my mom talk,
it's like heart-to-heart.

30:46.386 --> 30:50.723
[stammers] I know what it is
'cause I have a mug shot, too.

30:51.224 --> 30:55.896
I went down for conspiracy with intent
because of who I associated myself with.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.440
Those were conversations
we never had with our kids,

30:59.524 --> 31:00.650
until after the fact.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.486
Those are conversations we should've had
from our kids from the beginning.

31:03.569 --> 31:04.905
My pride was in the way

31:04.988 --> 31:08.449
'cause I never sat down
with one of my kids to know that side.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.952
So I never taught him that.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.914
And I had to stand outside, later in life,
picking him up from a jail,

31:13.997 --> 31:17.417
and say, ''Dude, this is me,
this is my mug shot.

31:17.500 --> 31:22.213
Never do I want your life or yours
to chase you where mine chased me."

31:23.839 --> 31:27.969
[over speakers]  â™ª Fuck it
I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª

31:28.053 --> 31:31.514
â™ª Yeah
What's a life without 'em commas? â™ª

31:31.598 --> 31:34.851
â™ªYeah
I like bitches with no drama â™ª

31:35.351 --> 31:38.104
â™ª Yeah
I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª

31:38.187 --> 31:41.649
â™ª I just want to make it for my grandma
You can have all the cars and shoes â™ª

31:41.732 --> 31:45.320
â™ª She works so hard in the a.m.
With no rest in the afternoon â™ª

31:45.403 --> 31:47.572
â™ª She raised three kids
All of them now in their 40s â™ª

31:47.655 --> 31:49.157
â™ª But two of them still in the house â™ª

31:49.240 --> 31:50.909
â™ª Bless her heart
She loves them to death â™ª

31:50.992 --> 31:52.868
â™ª But she ain't got the heart
To kick 'em out â™ª

31:52.953 --> 31:54.829
â™ª I got so many problems â™ª

31:54.913 --> 31:56.872
â™ª I know I sound like a broken record â™ª

31:56.957 --> 31:58.583
â™ª I told her help was coming soon â™ª

31:58.666 --> 32:00.293
â™ª But now I gotta reschedule it â™ª

32:01.211 --> 32:02.212
â™ª Yeah â™ª

32:02.295 --> 32:04.839
â™ª My momma abandoned me
Daddy were absent â™ª

32:04.923 --> 32:06.049
[yelling]

32:06.132 --> 32:08.634
â™ª Don't you ever question
Why my granny's so special â™ª

32:09.928 --> 32:11.304
â™ª I pray to God
Go to war with the devil â™ª

32:11.387 --> 32:13.431
â™ª I'm down for whatever
I'm stuck in my childhood â™ª

32:13.514 --> 32:15.766
â™ª I'll make sure we'll be rich forever
Case sold â™ª

32:15.850 --> 32:17.060
-Oh!
-â™ª Fuck it â™ª

32:17.143 --> 32:19.562
â™ª I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª

32:19.645 --> 32:22.732
â™ª Yeah
What's a life without 'em commas? â™ª

32:24.192 --> 32:26.527
â™ª I like bitches with no drama â™ª

32:27.320 --> 32:30.281
Everybody in Chauncey's
and Kam's room!

32:30.365 --> 32:32.783
[laughing]

32:34.619 --> 32:36.412
[Kam] Why everybody in my room?

32:36.496 --> 32:38.331
Shut up, Kam, you don't run nothing here.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.083
[player 1] Man, this Chauncey's room!

32:40.166 --> 32:42.085
-[chuckles]
-Come on, run it!

32:42.168 --> 32:44.045
-[player 2] Think I wanna be in your room?
-[player 3] Stop!

32:44.129 --> 32:46.631
I'll whoop the shit out of Kam's ass.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.424
Look at that motherfucker tired.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.011
-[player 4] Your reign is over, son.
-[Rodney] I need Hayes!

32:51.094 --> 32:52.887
-[yelling]
-Son of a bitch.

32:54.555 --> 32:57.600
[Rodney] Make it go.
Touchdown. Touchdown. Oh!

32:57.683 --> 33:02.105
Touchdown. Touchdown! Touchdown!
[chuckles]

33:09.153 --> 33:12.573
[Wagner] Do we have things that
we could be doing instead of sleeping?

33:14.534 --> 33:17.245
-I got an offer from Louisville.
-Okay, well, then you know what?

33:17.328 --> 33:20.123
We need to be doing what we gotta do
in order to get there.

33:20.206 --> 33:23.668
-Sleeping ain't helping.
-[sighs and mumbles]

33:23.751 --> 33:26.712
-Huh?
-I'd rather sleep now than in class.

33:26.796 --> 33:31.259
[Wagner] I would rather you sleep at night
and when you come in here, get stuff done.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.760
What do we have to do?

33:33.053 --> 33:35.638
And it's midterm,
and I have midterm grades.

33:35.721 --> 33:38.849
So I'm a little, um...
The first half of the semester,

33:38.933 --> 33:41.436
I'm a little lax
in letting you handle your shit,

33:41.519 --> 33:45.398
but the second half of the semester,
not so much. Let's go.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.025
I always handle my shit.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.109
[Wagner] Apparently not.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.862
I have your grades in my office
if you would like to see them.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.199
I'm getting up.

33:55.491 --> 34:00.038
I don't understand why
it has to be such a dramatic event.

34:01.664 --> 34:05.668
'Cause I don't be bothering nobody,
and then people start to bother me.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.796
You know I get my work done.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.674
I don't got no missing assignments.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.724
[Wagner] You have to put
your whole address in.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.773
[Kam sighs]

34:43.789 --> 34:47.252
You have to put your e-mail address in,
in order for it to log you on.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.421
No, you don't. I do it every day.
I do this every day.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.673
Well, really? It keeps not putting you in.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.265
[sighs]

35:01.641 --> 35:04.185
I can't. I can't do it.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.162
[Wood]  Really no motivation needed
for this week.

35:22.245 --> 35:26.999
This is the team last year that you came
in and handed it to 'em good at our place.

35:27.082 --> 35:29.169
We had the deal at Delta
the following week,

35:29.252 --> 35:32.505
and then we go from being third,
to dropping down to ninth.

35:32.588 --> 35:35.466
They going from being fifth,
moving up to one.

35:35.550 --> 35:39.679
They ended up getting to play the team
out of, I think, Minnesota for the title.

35:39.762 --> 35:41.972
This is the defending national champion
that you get to play.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.017
[De'Andre]  They're the number one team
as of right now.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.478
So now it's, like, gonna take what's ours.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.689
Get out our throne
and let us sit back down.

35:49.772 --> 35:53.901
[stammering] You know,
so it's gonna be a grudge match.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.987
[Buddy] You get to play the guys
that had the asterisk.

35:57.071 --> 35:58.739
They won your ring last year.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.616
You know that. They know that.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.411
This is a big week as far as, uh,
you moving up

36:03.494 --> 36:06.456
and putting yourself
into a national championship picture.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.291
Bottom line.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.752
[Ed Holly] When the pressure gets him,
make the play!

36:11.836 --> 36:14.422
-[coach] Hey. Right there. Hold it.
-[whistle blows]

36:14.505 --> 36:16.841
-[indistinct yelling]
-[Ed Holly] Stand up to the pressure.

36:16.924 --> 36:21.887
[Isaiah] Hey, don't get scared.
Don't get scared. Don't get scared.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.392
[players grunting]

36:27.518 --> 36:29.896
-[Chauncey] That's a sack!
-[Isaiah] That's not a damn sack.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.856
[Chauncey] Y'all gonna bullshit?
That's a sack.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.941
-[Isaiah] That ain't no sack.
-[Chauncey] Can't guard me.

36:34.024 --> 36:35.901
-[Isaiah] That ain't no sack.
-[Chauncey] They can't guard me.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.570
-[Isaiah] That ain't no sack.
-[Chauncey] That's a sack.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.780
-They can't guard me.
-[coach] All right, Chauncey.

36:40.865 --> 36:44.202
-[Chauncey] Can't guard me. It's a sack.
-Fuck is that a sack if you blocked?

36:44.827 --> 36:46.996
-Can't fucking guard me.
-Chauncey, you sorry, dog.

36:47.079 --> 36:50.082
-I don't give a fuck. You can't guard me.
-Bitch, you can't tackle me.

36:53.168 --> 36:55.129
If he was tackling,
we'd have been scoring.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.423
-[coach] That's the way to stop.
-You don't think so?

36:57.506 --> 36:59.842
-[Johnson] I said, "I don't disagree."
-I was about to say.

36:59.925 --> 37:03.095
[Johnson] Good Lord, man. Jeez.
You got too much hatred in you, man.

37:03.178 --> 37:05.515
They hungry, bro.
Leave them alone. They hungry, bro.

37:05.598 --> 37:08.643
Hey, look. Hey, calm down, lap dog.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.935
[player 1] He called you a lap dog.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.230
No, I ain't listening to that.
That why I'm talking, son.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.232
[Isaiah] How you sacked
and I got you pushed to the outside?

37:14.315 --> 37:18.611
-[Johnson] Brooks, come yank his leash.
-[player 2] Better listen to that man.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.655
You need to be telling Zeke
to stay on the outside.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.741
Your dog's getting a little too feisty
while you got him on the chain.

37:23.824 --> 37:26.077
[Mario] That's the point.
We ain't never been on no chain.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.371
We been running this shit since.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.081
[player 1] I run this shit Saturday.

37:31.874 --> 37:34.419
[Mario] He gonna get his ass beat,
he keep playing. [chuckles]

37:34.502 --> 37:36.629
[Buddy]  Good day today.
Let's go. Break it down. Hurry.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.005
[player] Lions on three, champs on six.

37:38.088 --> 37:39.131
-One, two, three.
-[all] Lions!

37:39.214 --> 37:40.425
-[player] Four, five, six.
-[all] Champs!

37:40.508 --> 37:42.468
[Buddy] Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:42.551 --> 37:45.429
What the hell's wrong with y'all?
Seriously?

37:45.930 --> 37:48.974
[stammering] Y'all got everything
in front of you.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.184
You got everything in front of you

37:50.268 --> 37:52.395
and there's not a lot of excitement
going on right now.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.689
Hey, you better understand
what you got in front of you

37:54.772 --> 37:56.816
and take advantage of it.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.859
You guys that were
on this team last year,

37:58.943 --> 38:00.695
you were in this position,
it was taken from you.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.115
Now, by God, go out
and take this from them. You understand?

38:04.198 --> 38:07.952
Hey, don't be pissing around with it.
If you don't wanna be out here, don't be,

38:08.035 --> 38:11.706
but the guys that wanna play,
be on that field on Saturday.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.417
Now come on, dadgummit,
break this shit down and let's go.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.251
Let's go, break it down. Loud.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.837
[player] Lions on three, champs on six.

38:17.920 --> 38:18.963
-One, two, three.
-[all] Lions!

38:19.046 --> 38:20.130
-[player] Four, five, six.
-[all] Champs!

38:20.214 --> 38:24.469
-[Buddy] There you go!
-[Williams] Kam! Kam!

38:24.552 --> 38:25.928
[Maleke] He called 'em bitches.

38:26.011 --> 38:29.264
-[Williams] Kam! Come here, come here.
-[Maleke] I don't know why he did.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.975
I had to straighten him out for that.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.394
He was like,
"Man, them bitches trippin', man."

38:33.478 --> 38:37.565
Yeah, you gotta roll him, homey.
They don't talk to these women like that.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.442
Ain't that right?

38:40.109 --> 38:41.486
[Williams] 'Cause you called
them girls bitches.

38:42.194 --> 38:45.865
-I mean, I didn't say it to their face.
-[Williams chuckles]

38:45.948 --> 38:48.993
Just 'cause your back was turned,
don't mean that they didn't hear you.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.995
[Kam] It wasn't intended for them to hear.

38:51.161 --> 38:52.747
[Williams] You shouldn't have said it.

38:52.830 --> 38:56.417
Man, I stick to what I said.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.336
-You stick to what?
-What I said.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.295
-What that mean?
-I don't know. I don't know.

39:00.380 --> 39:01.881
[Williams] Stop. What that mean?

39:01.964 --> 39:05.217
[Kam] What I said about them.
They're snitches now, too.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.761
[Williams] Oh, hell, we got...

39:06.844 --> 39:10.556
What's 120 plus two?
Plus times two times two.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.724
[Kam] Hey, chill.

39:12.307 --> 39:13.351
-[Williams] Huh?
-Chill.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.936
-[Williams] You stick to what you said?
-Yes.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.147
[Williams] Okay, well,
we gonna head down and back then.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.190
-[Kam] Why?
-You stick to what you said.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.734
-[Kam] Why?
-'Cause...

39:22.151 --> 39:23.861
-[Kam] Coach.
-Let's go!

39:23.944 --> 39:25.363
-[Kam] That's not fair.
-That is fair.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.824
[Williams] It ain't fair for you
to be calling young girls the b-word

39:28.908 --> 39:30.618
-when they doing their damn job.
-[grunts]

39:31.786 --> 39:35.039
[Williams] Come on, son. Pick it up, man.
Stop fighting this shit and just do it.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.331
Let's go, son. I gotta go eat.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.084
[Kam] Man, this is getting fucked.

39:40.002 --> 39:41.962
[Williams] Keep going, let's go, man.
Come on.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.964
[Kam grunts]

39:44.048 --> 39:46.175
I hope my daughter never snitch.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.553
[Williams] Bet you be lucky you rolling,

39:48.636 --> 39:52.348
'cause if you was anybody else,
you'd have been beat up, shot or killed.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.144
-Ready?
-Huh?

39:57.228 --> 39:58.604
-You ready?
-For what?

39:58.979 --> 40:00.189
Go back to the 50.

40:01.106 --> 40:02.775
You said 120, Coach.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.778
I said depending on how you did that one,
depending on if you got another one.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.321
I did that zone good.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.198
No, that's a negative.
You stopped four times.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.159
Man, 'cause I called some girls
some bitches.

40:12.242 --> 40:15.455
Yeah. That's why.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.416
Would you want somebody
calling your mama that?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.626
Or calling your grandma that?

40:20.710 --> 40:23.128
-Come on. Let's go.
-Coach.

40:23.212 --> 40:26.131
[grunting] Fucking bitches.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.051
[Williams] Straighten up!
Don't stop! Don't stop.

40:31.345 --> 40:34.724
-Turn this way!
-[Kam] What way? I don't see you!

40:34.807 --> 40:36.934
[Williams] Let's go!
I'm right here. Let's go, son.

40:38.143 --> 40:39.729
[Williams laughing]

40:41.772 --> 40:43.774
Hey, he had enough?
Has he had enough?

40:44.650 --> 40:45.776
Y'all call it.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.944
[woman] Yes.

40:47.027 --> 40:50.364
-[Kam] Damn, son.
-[Williams] Hey, let's go, man. Get up!

40:50.448 --> 40:52.533
[Kam grunts] Fuck.

40:56.161 --> 40:58.122
I ain't doing that apologizing shit.

40:58.205 --> 41:01.291
Those girls just saved you.
You're not gonna go apologize to 'em?

41:01.375 --> 41:03.043
-No, I don't fuck with them.
-Huh?

41:03.127 --> 41:04.462
I don't fuck with them.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.673
-Is that how you're gonna act?
-Yeah.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.842
-Why?
-'Cause...

41:09.925 --> 41:13.220
You disrespected them,
they turned around and was nice to you,

41:13.303 --> 41:14.597
told me to leave you alone.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.681
And you don't have the...

41:15.765 --> 41:18.559
You don't think you need to
apologize to 'em? Huh?

41:18.642 --> 41:21.604
-No.
-You gonna have a long life, son.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.564
A long, hard life 'cause of that.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.026
Long, hard life.

41:39.454 --> 41:40.706
[Tim] You gonna be here tomorrow?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.333
[Tim's brother]  What time?
Tomorrow at 2:00?

41:43.417 --> 41:44.752
Yeah, two o'clock.

41:45.127 --> 41:46.336
I need me some sacks, bro.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.964
I'm the only one on D-line
ain't got no sacks, bro.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.465
Shit flew by too quick, bro.

41:50.550 --> 41:56.346
[stammers]  Hey, you seen that new...
that new video--

41:56.430 --> 41:59.433
Man, I don't give a damn
about no video game either, boy.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.768
Called  Battlefield.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.729
Oh, boy, I'm about to hang up
the phone on you, bro.

42:03.813 --> 42:04.897
Dog, come on.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.525
I ain't even doing nothing for real,
I'm just talking to you.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.693
Man, I just wanna talk to you.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.445
I don't wanna hear about
no train, no truck.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.240
Boy, I'm hurting right now, nigga,
I ain't got no sacks, boy.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.534
[both laughing]

42:18.077 --> 42:21.246
[Williams] You know, sometimes, man,
I struggle with believing.

42:21.330 --> 42:24.458
I struggle in believing
in some things, you know.

42:25.042 --> 42:28.379
I struggle in believing that,
you know...

42:29.213 --> 42:31.298
I'm coaching football for a living.

42:31.381 --> 42:34.301
Can't believe it,
but I'm doing it, you know.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.763
I even struggle sometimes in believing
that my girlfriend love me.

42:38.263 --> 42:39.599
You know, it's tough.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.266
-[scattered laughter]
-But she do.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.894
I wanna let you guys know,

42:43.978 --> 42:48.524
despite all the frustration
we've been through since training camp,

42:49.024 --> 42:52.361
me getting on you,
you walking off the field,

42:52.444 --> 42:57.992
y'all snapping back, me getting loud,
me running and going overboard...

42:58.075 --> 43:00.578
Despite of all that, guys,
I believe in y'all.

43:00.661 --> 43:01.829
[Kam] You rolling us...

43:01.912 --> 43:05.082
-Me rolling y'all. I believe in y'all.
-[players laughing]

43:06.083 --> 43:07.877
I believe in y'all, guys.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.046
If we go out and stop the run,
I believe we gonna win.

43:12.798 --> 43:16.802
Okay? I believe once we stop the run,
we're gonna have to pass rush.

43:16.886 --> 43:18.596
I believe we gonna get
some sacks tomorrow.

43:19.179 --> 43:22.182
I believe that
'cause I believe in y'all.

43:23.308 --> 43:25.560
Okay? Now me believing in you guys

43:25.645 --> 43:28.355
don't mean a hill of beans
if you don't believe in yourself.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.401
We all have to believe in ourselves.

43:33.068 --> 43:35.613
'Cause I do believe in you.

43:39.241 --> 43:40.409
[indistinct chatter]

43:40.492 --> 43:43.078
[Williams] Hey, man.
Hey, come here, man. Come here.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.290
Are you a person
that believes in what people--

43:46.373 --> 43:49.960
-Yo, I got confidence in myself.
-No! Just wait. Let me finish.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.630
Are you a person that believes in
what people say or what people do?

43:54.173 --> 43:56.967
-I believe in what you say.
-Well, you need to believe in what I do.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.637
-Mm-hmm.
-I have never benched you, right?

43:59.720 --> 44:03.891
Okay, so the fact that you keep going in
ball games, what'd that let you know?

44:05.225 --> 44:06.518
You trust me.

44:06.601 --> 44:09.438
That I believe in you.
Believe is the key word.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.231
You understand?

44:11.315 --> 44:13.358
Okay? When I was sitting there
and gave that speech,

44:13.442 --> 44:15.152
-I gave that speech to you.
-Yes, sir.

44:15.235 --> 44:17.446
-I need you to ball tomorrow now.
-I got you.

44:17.529 --> 44:18.989
Okay. Don't have me, have you.

44:19.073 --> 44:22.284
Yeah, I got me.
But at the same time, I got you.

44:22.367 --> 44:23.618
'Cause you my coach,
you gotta coach me.

44:23.703 --> 44:25.871
-All right, all right. I hear you.
-Hey.

44:26.914 --> 44:30.668
Look here. I got you.
I mean, I got me too, but I got you, too.

44:30.751 --> 44:31.836
-All right.
-But look here.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.295
Put Bino in, see what happens.

44:33.378 --> 44:36.674
-Who is Bino?
-Me. Put me in and see what happens.

44:36.757 --> 44:39.927
Coach, I promise you.
After I get some good sleep tonight,

44:40.010 --> 44:42.596
I'm gonna put
that Boosie Baby, DB loop on.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.556
-I'm gonna go out, boy.
-[Williams laughing]

44:44.639 --> 44:47.267
Boosie, well, well, well.
I hope that get you going.

44:47.351 --> 44:50.062
-[Lil   Boosie's "Zoom" playing]
-â™ª Boosie   Badass â™ª

44:50.145 --> 44:51.897
â™ª Yung   Joc, we gotta hit
Let's go, baby â™ª

44:51.980 --> 44:53.982
â™ª Everybody like, zoom â™ª

44:54.066 --> 44:57.027
â™ª Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom â™ª

44:57.111 --> 44:59.238
-â™ª Zoom, zoom â™ª

44:59.321 --> 45:02.908
â™ª Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom â™ª

45:14.211 --> 45:17.089
â™ª Ask my dogg   Webbie
This is how it goes down â™ª

45:17.172 --> 45:18.673
[Buddy]  Control your environment.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.384
Control the environment you in.

45:20.467 --> 45:22.887
Stay on them. We keep hammerin'.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.388
Don't let them breathe.

45:24.471 --> 45:26.766
Take care of your brother out there.

45:26.849 --> 45:30.144
[Crowder]  Good afternoon, fans,
and welcome inside Sullivan-Windham Field,

45:30.227 --> 45:32.312
where it's a top five battle,

45:32.396 --> 45:35.816
where the number one team
is not the home team.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.943
That's a big rarity
here in Scooba, Mississippi.

45:38.027 --> 45:41.822
The number one team, Northwest,
are the reigning national champions.

45:41.906 --> 45:46.786
Put an asterisk by it because EMCC beat
this team by three touchdowns a year ago.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.663
[Wood]  Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go! Offense!

45:49.746 --> 45:51.248
[Crowder]  If EMCC can win today,

45:51.331 --> 45:53.918
they might put themselves
in that position.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.045
Johnson has pressure,
but on the near side now.

45:56.128 --> 45:59.339
Steps up, has a wide-open field.
First down.

45:59.423 --> 46:00.674
[Wood] Good job, attababy!

46:00.757 --> 46:04.344
[Winfield]  De'Andre Johnson
might be the best example

46:04.428 --> 46:06.847
of a dual-threat quarterback
I have ever seen.

46:07.389 --> 46:10.601
Hey! Tomahawk right! Tomahawk right!
Tomahawk right!

46:10.684 --> 46:12.186
[player] East, east, east!

46:12.269 --> 46:14.229
[Crowder]  Snap to Johnson,
back to pass, pocket collapses.

46:14.313 --> 46:15.605
-Fires it over the middle.
-[player] There it is!

46:15.689 --> 46:19.401
Caught! Ten-yard line, five-yard line...
Touchdown, EMCC!

46:19.484 --> 46:22.696
And they lead it, 6-nothing.
They strike first blood.

46:22.779 --> 46:24.573
-[Wood]  Attaboy.
-[Buddy]  Good job! Attababy!

46:24.656 --> 46:26.325
Good job, good job.

46:26.408 --> 46:27.451
Good shit, good shit.

46:27.534 --> 46:30.830
[Crowder]  Thirteenth touchdown pass
thrown by De'Andre Johnson.

46:30.913 --> 46:31.997
EMCC leads it, 7-nothing.

46:32.081 --> 46:33.207
[Buddy] Keep coming off the ball!

46:33.290 --> 46:35.918
You understand? Come off the ball
and punch 'em in the mouth.

46:36.001 --> 46:37.127
Let's go, D.

46:37.211 --> 46:40.130
[Crowder]  It was the defense
that really took a hit this past week

46:40.214 --> 46:41.423
by their play at Holmes.

46:41.506 --> 46:43.592
[Winfield]
They got back to the basics on defense.

46:43.675 --> 46:45.719
Gotta lock up a little bit
and tackle now and then.

46:45.802 --> 46:48.472
[Crowder]  The snap to hold Holgorsen,
back to pass, has pressure, he's hit.

46:48.555 --> 46:49.639
He's dropped and sacked at the 32...

46:49.723 --> 46:52.476
-[Williams] Good job!
-Get him! Let's go!

46:52.559 --> 46:54.728
[Williams]  That's it!
That's what I'm talkin' about, 29!

46:54.811 --> 46:59.066
Good job! That's it, boy! That's it!

46:59.149 --> 47:01.110
That's how you get after
the damn quarterback.

47:01.193 --> 47:04.196
You understand? That's how you get
after the quarterback. All day.

47:04.279 --> 47:05.572
Whoo!

47:06.323 --> 47:08.993
Boy. That shit feels so good, boy.

47:09.076 --> 47:12.162
[Crowder]  Big-time sack and hit
by EMCC. Is that Ezekiel Rose?

47:12.246 --> 47:14.581
[Winfield]  It is Ezekiel Rose.

47:14.665 --> 47:18.418
How you didn't kill his ass, Zeke?
You shoulda killed his ass.

47:18.502 --> 47:21.255
He didn't even see you comin', bro,
you had a full... Talkin' about--

47:21.338 --> 47:23.131
I didn't wanna go low.
They were gonna throw a flag.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.383
Go low!

47:24.466 --> 47:26.927
I was finna knock his ass out.

47:27.011 --> 47:28.845
We were finna hit his ass
just like that, bro.

47:28.929 --> 47:31.890
I'm gonna have that motherfuckin' sack.
I'm gonna get that bitch today, boy.

47:31.974 --> 47:34.434
[Crowder]  So with 6:14 to go,
EMCC gets the ball back.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.353
Here's the snap.
They leave it with Wright.

47:36.436 --> 47:39.106
Big hole behind left guard.
First down and more.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.315
He's bowlin' through people

47:40.399 --> 47:42.276
and being held on
by the back of his jersey.

47:42.359 --> 47:43.735
Boy, what an explosive play.

47:43.819 --> 47:47.489
[Winfield]  One of the things you wanted
to see out of this team was fire.

47:47.572 --> 47:50.617
You wanted to see if they would come out
and play with an edge today.

47:50.700 --> 47:53.828
Look at Isaiah Wright
just dragging tackles on the block.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.622
Get out! Get out!

47:55.705 --> 47:57.041
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

47:57.124 --> 47:58.833
[Crowder]  So empty backfield for Johnson

47:58.918 --> 48:01.545
and third down in 15
from the 40 of Northwest.

48:01.628 --> 48:02.963
Back to pass, has all day.

48:03.047 --> 48:06.967
Fires it deep towards the end zone
and it is caught!

48:07.051 --> 48:08.969
Touchdown, EMCC!

48:09.053 --> 48:10.220
[Earl shouts and laughs]  Yeah!

48:10.304 --> 48:13.515
[Crowder]
Oh, my goodness, what a reception!

48:13.598 --> 48:16.601
Attababy! Touchdown! Attababy!

48:16.685 --> 48:17.769
Come on, we need that shit.

48:17.852 --> 48:20.397
[Winfield]
He had no end zone to spare

48:20.480 --> 48:23.150
when he caught that football
before he was out of the end zone.

48:23.233 --> 48:26.403
[Crowder]  And EMCC leads it
17-nothing here in the second quarter.

48:26.486 --> 48:27.862
Hey, let's go! Let's go, D!

48:27.947 --> 48:30.199
[Crowder]  EMCC on top
but number one, Northwest,

48:30.282 --> 48:32.993
is threatening with a first and goal,
down to the EMCC five.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.579
The snap to Holgorsen,
and he's gonna throw it.

48:35.662 --> 48:39.959
Slant, caught, touchdown, Northwest,
from five yards out, near side.

48:40.042 --> 48:41.961
[Ed Holly] Man coverage on the slant.
We gotta win.

48:42.044 --> 48:44.588
Come on.
That's our best corner, he's gotta win.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.090
Hey! That's your best D?

48:46.173 --> 48:48.717
-Here we go, here we go.
-[Williams] We gotta do a better job now.

48:48.800 --> 48:51.553
[Crowder]  And it's 17-7,
so it's a ten-point game here in Scooba.

48:51.636 --> 48:53.263
Hold on, it's not a blow out yet.

48:53.347 --> 48:55.890
It's gonna be interesting
to see how they respond emotionally.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.642
-[De'Andre] East!
-[Crowder]  Here's the snap.

48:57.726 --> 48:59.353
Johnson, looking towards Wright.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.981
Back side pressure's gonna bring him
down at the 41-yard line.

49:02.064 --> 49:03.983
-[Buddy] Isaiah!
-[Isaiah groans]

49:04.066 --> 49:05.692
Don't do that, Isaiah!

49:05.775 --> 49:07.152
-[Isaiah] Fuck!
-[Buddy] Let's go!

49:07.236 --> 49:09.613
[Crowder]  Snap from the 31,
they leave it on the ground.

49:09.696 --> 49:12.241
Wright. Trying to get around right hand.
Gonna split defenders.

49:12.324 --> 49:14.159
And his knee's gonna go down
around the 26.

49:14.243 --> 49:18.330
[Buddy]  Get him up. Get him up,
get him up. Get up, get up. Get up!

49:18.413 --> 49:20.415
[Isaiah] They're tryin' to fuck me up.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.792
[Crowder]  It looks like Isaiah Wright
was injured.

49:22.876 --> 49:24.836
[Isaiah] Oh! Fell on the back of my ankle!

49:24.919 --> 49:27.172
[Buddy] Zay! I don't want you...
Come here. Look at me.

49:27.256 --> 49:29.508
Don't limp. Don't show 'em no weakness,
you understand?

49:29.591 --> 49:32.344
-[Isaiah] That face mask--
-I know. I know, I know. You okay?

49:32.427 --> 49:34.054
[Isaiah] No, he fell
on the back of my ankle.

49:34.137 --> 49:36.390
[Crowder]  His injury looked bad.
He's got a high ankle sprain.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.600
[Isaiah] Oh, fuck!

49:38.683 --> 49:39.768
[groans]

49:39.851 --> 49:41.228
It's okay, just breathe.

49:41.311 --> 49:42.896
I can't even put my weight on it.

49:42.979 --> 49:45.065
[Crowder]  High ankle sprain
is the worst you can get,

49:45.149 --> 49:47.276
and it's the longest to recover from.

49:47.359 --> 49:50.654
Jacquez Horsley replaces him.
He's in motion and now sets up

49:50.737 --> 49:52.280
to the left of Johnson in the backfield.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.990
They'll leave it with Horsley,
he bowls up the middle,

49:54.074 --> 49:55.742
working his legs, dive to the goal line.

49:55.825 --> 49:56.868
Touchdown, EMCC!

49:56.951 --> 49:58.037
[crowd cheering]

49:58.120 --> 49:59.621
[Winfield]
What will they say about Horsley?

49:59.704 --> 50:02.999
He's a guy who does not go down
on first contact.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.126
He took a hit at the two...

50:04.209 --> 50:05.960
[Buddy] Just roll 'em.
We'll be okay with Isaiah out.

50:06.045 --> 50:07.587
We're okay with Isaiah out.

50:09.298 --> 50:11.300
[Crowder]
And EMCC's up two touchdowns again.

50:11.383 --> 50:12.676
All the marbles are out there.

50:12.759 --> 50:15.720
If EMCC wins, they're guaranteed
to host first round to the playoffs.

50:15.804 --> 50:17.431
[Williams] Go get 'em! Go get 'em!

50:17.514 --> 50:18.640
[Crowder]  Holgorsen fires it near side.

50:18.723 --> 50:21.435
Receiver slipped down. He was nowhere
near it and it falls incomplete.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.812
[Winfield]
Oh, but we're going to have a flag.

50:23.895 --> 50:26.731
-[Williams] Hey, who was that?
-[Winfield]  And it's not a good one, Glen.

50:26.815 --> 50:28.108
[Buddy]  Chauncey!

50:28.192 --> 50:29.943
[Williams]  Come on, Chauncey,
be careful now!

50:30.026 --> 50:31.695
[Ed Holly]  Let's just play.

50:31.778 --> 50:32.987
Had 'em fucking stopped.

50:33.072 --> 50:34.823
[Beard]  That's gonna be Chauncey Rivers.

50:34.906 --> 50:36.408
He's guilty of the face mask right there.

50:36.491 --> 50:37.742
Let's go. Let's go.

50:37.826 --> 50:39.161
[Crowder]  First down, ten to go.

50:39.244 --> 50:41.996
After that face mask,
EMCC's gonna jump offside

50:42.081 --> 50:44.416
for the right side free play,
and it's a fade paddle,

50:44.499 --> 50:47.043
and it's gonna be intercepted by
EMCC at the 39.

50:47.127 --> 50:48.295
But this one's gonna be coming back.

50:48.378 --> 50:50.672
[Buddy]  No. Hey! We're offside.

50:50.755 --> 50:53.425
[Trickett]  Oh, dumbass, Chauncey.
Fucking Chauncey.

50:53.508 --> 50:55.844
[Buddy] Chauncey! Get over here!

50:55.927 --> 50:57.137
[Williams] Come on, Chauncey!

50:57.221 --> 50:59.931
[Beard]  Yeah, Chauncey just jumped
the gun a little bit right there.

51:00.014 --> 51:01.100
Too early.

51:01.183 --> 51:02.726
[indistinct chattering]

51:03.477 --> 51:04.894
[Buddy] Chauncey, shut the fuck up

51:04.978 --> 51:07.522
or either go back over there and sit down
and take off...

51:07.606 --> 51:10.734
Hey. Hey, Chauncey, Chauncey.
Chauncey. Chauncey.

51:10.817 --> 51:13.237
Chauncey. Chauncey, come here, man.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.572
Come here, Chauncey.
Hey, Chauncey, come here.

51:15.655 --> 51:19.118
Hey. I'm about that close to tellin' you
to take your shit and go. You understand?

51:19.201 --> 51:20.535
-[Chauncey] Yeah.
-You understand me?

51:20.619 --> 51:22.621
No, ain't no "yeah." It's "yes, sir."
Understand?

51:22.704 --> 51:23.955
-[Chauncey] I got you.
-Ain't no "got you."

51:24.038 --> 51:27.584
Watch the dadgum ball
and play like you're supposed to play.

51:27.667 --> 51:30.420
Get off the field! Get off the field!

51:30.504 --> 51:32.172
[marching band playing]

51:34.841 --> 51:37.219
Hey. Get away from me right now.

51:39.929 --> 51:42.932
[Winfield]  Now you need the defense
to step up for East Mississippi.

51:43.016 --> 51:45.185
You had a 17-nothing lead

51:45.269 --> 51:47.312
and you do not want to turn this
into a one-score game.

51:47.396 --> 51:51.275
But Rangers have a chance to do that
if they can put together a drive.

51:51.358 --> 51:53.360
[Crowder]  EMCC showing pressure.
Here they come.

51:53.443 --> 51:55.945
Back to pass,
firing it deep down the near sideline

51:56.029 --> 51:57.697
and it's caught inside the 30.

51:57.781 --> 51:58.823
[Winfield]  All of a sudden,

51:58.907 --> 52:02.494
this Northwest team that just looked
incompetent in the first quarter,

52:02.577 --> 52:04.371
looking proficient here in the second.

52:04.454 --> 52:06.331
We got it. We're there.
We just gotta make it.

52:06.415 --> 52:08.542
We got it. Orange, orange,
orange, orange, orange.

52:08.625 --> 52:10.252
[Crowder]  Here's the snap.
Back to pass,

52:10.335 --> 52:13.547
fires it near side towards the end zone,
and it is caught...

52:13.630 --> 52:15.549
-Touchdown!
-[crowd cheering]

52:15.632 --> 52:16.758
Boy, and I'll tell you what.

52:16.841 --> 52:18.385
Northwest made this game interesting.

52:18.468 --> 52:20.053
It was 17-nothing.

52:20.136 --> 52:21.971
All of a sudden, bam!

52:22.847 --> 52:25.642
I'm trying, I'm trying.
I swear to goodness, I'm trying.

52:25.725 --> 52:27.977
"I'm two seconds away
from telling you to take your shit off"?

52:28.061 --> 52:29.062
Man, get the...

52:29.145 --> 52:31.981
Hey, hey, Chauncey.
Keep ballin'. You understand?

52:32.065 --> 52:34.401
The game is bigger
than what you talkin' about right now.

52:34.484 --> 52:35.902
[Crowder]  That's your score
at the half.

52:35.985 --> 52:37.987
24-17 in this top five battle.

52:38.071 --> 52:40.490
Boy, hold on, Charlie.
This second half is gonna be a fun one.

52:40.574 --> 52:41.741
We'll be back with Charlie...

52:41.825 --> 52:43.618
[Buddy]  Defense, you gotta get us a stop.

52:43.702 --> 52:46.037
I can't be at another track meet,
I promise you.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.332
You bring the shit now and play hard.

52:48.415 --> 52:51.460
No stupid penalties.
We don't have stupid penalties

52:51.543 --> 52:53.462
and we don't have
stupid blown assignments.

52:53.545 --> 52:56.923
It ain't even close! It ain't even close!

52:57.006 --> 53:00.176
It's there for you to take.
It's there for you to take.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.761
Are you going to take it?

53:01.845 --> 53:02.846
[door thuds]

53:03.763 --> 53:05.014
[Williams] Hey, listen.

53:05.098 --> 53:09.269
This team that we're playing right now,
okay, is not a better team than you are.

53:09.353 --> 53:13.357
We have to come out this second half
and we have to take control of the ball.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.441
Okay?

53:14.524 --> 53:17.611
Let's kill it. Let's kill it.

53:17.694 --> 53:19.195
Come out here with this energy,

53:19.279 --> 53:21.448
them three sacks
that we didn't get the first half?

53:21.531 --> 53:23.283
Let's give them three sacks this half.

53:23.367 --> 53:24.993
We can do this.

53:25.952 --> 53:28.997
We can do this. Okay?
This group can do this.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.540
Y'all good?

53:30.624 --> 53:33.460
Come on now.
Make a difference now, okay? Let's go.

53:33.543 --> 53:36.087
Get up. Get up.
Let's go. Break it down.

53:38.047 --> 53:39.758
[Winfield]  One thing
Buddy Stephens talked about

53:39.841 --> 53:41.760
was wanting some of that swagger.

53:41.843 --> 53:44.137
I tend to think that swagger
is earned a little bit.

53:44.220 --> 53:45.847
You have to earn the right
to have an edge.

53:45.930 --> 53:46.931
[Crowder]  I agree.

53:47.015 --> 53:48.642
[Winfield]  If you wanna be
the best team in the country,

53:48.725 --> 53:49.809
it's not going to come easy.

53:49.893 --> 53:52.312
Now and then, you're gonna have to
rely on your defense

53:52.396 --> 53:54.898
to get back out on the field
and make some plays.

53:54.981 --> 53:56.400
This is one of those times.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.860
Really a gut check here
for the Lion defense.

54:05.367 --> 54:06.826
[players grunting]

54:08.745 --> 54:09.913
[Williams] There you go!

54:09.996 --> 54:11.039
[Crowder]  Back to pass... Pressure!

54:11.122 --> 54:13.500
He's sacked inside the 20,
back at the 18-yard line.

54:13.583 --> 54:16.127
Attaboy, Tim. Attaboy, Tim.

54:16.210 --> 54:18.963
[laughs] There you go, boy! Good job!

54:19.047 --> 54:20.674
[Crowder]
Coming up with a sack, Bonner!

54:20.757 --> 54:22.342
[Williams]  Yeah! That's it, boy!

54:22.426 --> 54:24.303
-Way to go, D-line.
-[Crowder]  Huge hit.

54:24.386 --> 54:25.219
Good job, boy!

54:25.304 --> 54:27.972
[Crowder]  Just absolutely creams him
at the nine-yard line.

54:28.056 --> 54:29.891
-[Ezekiel] There you go!
-[Williams] Good job.

54:29.974 --> 54:31.643
I talked about getting that, didn't I?

54:31.726 --> 54:33.061
That's how you affect the game.

54:33.144 --> 54:34.979
[indistinct chattering and rapping]

54:39.108 --> 54:41.361
Great job, man! Good job, man!

54:41.444 --> 54:44.114
[Winfield]  He has shown an ability
to make some big hits, and now...

54:44.197 --> 54:45.365
Let's go, let's go. Hurry up!

54:45.449 --> 54:47.701
...it gives them a chance to have
a good setup for offense.

54:47.784 --> 54:49.661
[Crowder]  Johnson takes the snap,
fires it left side...

54:49.744 --> 54:51.955
-Touchdown, EMCC!
-Well done.

54:52.038 --> 54:54.583
[Winfield]
Oh, my goodness, what a fast ball!

54:54.666 --> 54:56.876
[Crowder]  And EMCC
stretches the lead to two scores.

54:56.960 --> 55:00.213
[De'Andre] Hey, did y'all hear that shit?
Boom! I took his chest out.

55:00.296 --> 55:04.634
[Beard]  De'Andre throws the slant
harder than anybody I have ever seen.

55:04.718 --> 55:05.802
[Crowder]  This is fantastic.

55:05.885 --> 55:10.098
Here's the kick. Taken inside the five.
Right across the 20 and...

55:10.181 --> 55:12.767
Looks like it's gonna be flipped up
around the 27-yard line.

55:12.851 --> 55:14.853
-Oh, goodness gracious.
-[all cheering]

55:14.936 --> 55:16.187
[Winfield]  You've got 'em
where you want 'em,

55:16.270 --> 55:17.522
now we're gonna rough 'em up.

55:17.605 --> 55:20.442
-[Rock City's "I'm That" playing]
-â™ª We coming, we coming â™ª

55:21.151 --> 55:22.610
â™ª We coming â™ª

55:23.111 --> 55:24.612
â™ª Sim   simma â™ª

55:24.696 --> 55:26.573
Don't stop! Full speed attack!

55:28.157 --> 55:31.536
[Winfield]  Looked like he had been
shot out of a cannon that time.

55:31.620 --> 55:33.372
The defensive line
starting to be a factor.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.707
-[Williams] Right away, D! Good job!
-[Ed Holly] Love it!

55:35.790 --> 55:37.834
That was pretty damn good, man.

55:37.917 --> 55:41.254
â™ª All you ever been
Was a shoulda, coulda, woulda â™ª

55:41.337 --> 55:43.006
-[Crowder]  Here's the snap.
-Get him!

55:43.965 --> 55:46.050
[Crowder]  Back side pressure.
Hit, drop, sacked!

55:46.134 --> 55:47.802
-[Devaunya]  Get him!
-[Crowder]  Chauncey Rivers!

55:47.886 --> 55:50.263
[Williams] Good job, baby! Whoo!

55:50.346 --> 55:51.681
Hey, Chauncey, you got him!

55:51.765 --> 55:53.558
[Crowder]  If you're chased
by Chauncey Rivers

55:53.642 --> 55:55.101
all day, that'll give you nightmares.

55:55.184 --> 55:56.811
[Winfield]  I don't wanna do it.

55:56.895 --> 55:59.898
[Crowder]  Pressure, he's hit.
He's going down at the 20-yard line...

55:59.981 --> 56:01.483
-[Ed Holly] Yes!
-[Winfield]  Kam Carter.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.109
[Crowder]  Look at this defensive line.

56:03.192 --> 56:06.029
They're dancing to the music.
They're having a good time.

56:06.112 --> 56:07.196
And the offense,

56:07.280 --> 56:08.865
they have a little bit
to dance about, too.

56:08.948 --> 56:10.659
Fires it deep towards the end zone...

56:10.742 --> 56:12.619
It's caught! Touchdown, EMCC!

56:12.702 --> 56:15.747
EMCC has busted this game open, 43-25.

56:15.830 --> 56:17.624
Back to pass,
has pressure, can't avoid it.

56:17.707 --> 56:20.334
-And it's gonna be Bonner.
-[Williams squeals]  There ya go, Tim!

56:20.419 --> 56:22.003
There ya go, boy! There ya go!

56:22.086 --> 56:24.756
[Crowder]  Tim Bonner is gonna
come up with a huge, huge sack.

56:26.591 --> 56:28.301
[Williams]  Take him down!
Take him down!

56:28.384 --> 56:30.094
[Crowder]
Diamante Pounds knocks the ball out!

56:30.178 --> 56:32.889
EMCC's gonna pick it up
at the 31-yard line!

56:32.972 --> 56:34.766
[Winfield]
Tim Bonner to pick up the fumble.

56:34.849 --> 56:37.101
[Ed Holly] That's our ball,
that's our ball! Whoo!

56:37.185 --> 56:38.728
[Tim] Got that boy fumblin'-bumblin'.

56:38.812 --> 56:39.729
â™ª Sim   simma â™ª

56:41.064 --> 56:43.858
[Crowder]  Boy, that defensive front
really has stepped up.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.276
[player] That's what I'm talking about!

56:45.359 --> 56:46.861
-I got too excited.
-[Williams] Good game!

56:46.945 --> 56:48.154
I got a little bit too excited.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.949
[Crowder]  Bingo! This one is in the books.

56:53.660 --> 56:56.412
Buddy Stephens
and his football team came out

56:56.496 --> 56:59.373
and showed tenacity for four quarters,

56:59.458 --> 57:01.125
and defensively, blew up a bit.

57:01.209 --> 57:02.251
[Williams grunts]

57:03.044 --> 57:05.880
[Crowder]  And EMCC wins it, 51-32

57:05.964 --> 57:09.133
in a top five battle here
at homecoming in Scooba.

57:09.217 --> 57:10.677
-Boy, y'all stupid, man.
-[laughs]

57:10.760 --> 57:12.721
-You deserve it! Yo!
-Y'all stupid. [laughs]

57:12.804 --> 57:14.681
You deserve it, Coach! Bang on!

57:14.764 --> 57:16.307
Man, y'all was ballin', man.

57:16.390 --> 57:19.227
Good game, boy.
I'm proud of you, man. Proud of you.

57:19.310 --> 57:21.855
[Winfield]  EMCC has served notice

57:21.938 --> 57:25.609
that it is the best team
in junior college football.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.360
-All right!
-[Tim] Come on, boy.

57:33.157 --> 57:35.577
-[speaking indistinctly]
-I got you.

57:35.660 --> 57:37.078
[man] Keep your head up.

57:39.330 --> 57:41.249
Hey, bud. Hey!

57:41.624 --> 57:43.585
-Hey, babe.
-Oh, you look good.

57:46.880 --> 57:47.922
It is.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.966
-[Ezekiel] You doin' all right?
-You doin' all right?

57:50.049 --> 57:51.551
-Good game, man.
-[Ezekiel] I'm alive.

57:51.635 --> 57:53.887
[Devaunya] I'm proud of y'all today.
Y'all had some struggles.

57:53.970 --> 57:56.723
-[man] Yeah, you all overcame.
-[Devaunya] I was under straight duress.

57:56.806 --> 57:58.057
[chuckling]

57:58.141 --> 58:00.059
[man] Chauncey,
nobody can hold you back, man.

58:00.143 --> 58:02.145
[Devaunya]
Ain't nobody holding you back but you.

58:02.228 --> 58:04.606
Ain't nobody holding you back
right now but you.

58:04.689 --> 58:06.691
This is supposed to be
a pit stop in your life.

58:06.774 --> 58:11.488
Have fun, play ball,
but keep your eye on the prize.

58:12.363 --> 58:15.366
[Devaunya] Getting up out of Scooba
in the best situation possible.

58:15.449 --> 58:17.994
You need to look around,
you need to stand out here and see.

58:18.077 --> 58:21.665
Half these people you play with,
two-thirds of these people you play with,

58:21.748 --> 58:23.583
90% of these people you play with

58:23.667 --> 58:26.127
are never gonna go where you, 14 went,

58:26.210 --> 58:29.422
where John went, where Isaiah gonna go.

58:29.506 --> 58:30.799
They're not y'all.

58:30.882 --> 58:33.092
But you can end up like everybody else.

58:33.676 --> 58:35.970
You could be one injury away
from not playing.

58:36.054 --> 58:39.807
You could be one bad decision away
from your career being a past history.

58:39.891 --> 58:41.350
Be another nigga caught up in the system.

58:41.434 --> 58:42.936
Another nigga who got arrested
for some shit.

58:43.019 --> 58:44.604
Another nigga who didn't graduate
from college.

58:44.688 --> 58:47.023
Another black man with talent wasted.

58:47.106 --> 58:49.150
-[man] You can't... You gotta...
-Wasted.

58:49.233 --> 58:50.318
You gotta be committed and say,

58:50.401 --> 58:53.655
"Okay, this is what I'm gonna do
for the rest of my life."

58:53.738 --> 58:56.700
[Devaunya] Rest of my life.
God sent you down for a reason.

58:56.783 --> 59:01.996
This is supposed to be the one time
you get at another redo, son.

59:02.080 --> 59:06.585
I don't have no more tears to be
sitting there looking at another mug shot.

59:06.668 --> 59:09.337
Eye on the prize. Eye on the prize.

59:16.094 --> 59:18.930
-â™ª I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª
-â™ª For my momma â™ª

59:19.013 --> 59:22.517
â™ª Yo
What's a life without 'em commas? â™ª

59:22.600 --> 59:26.229
â™ª Yeah
I like bitches with no drama â™ª

59:26.312 --> 59:29.941
â™ª Yeah
Why cuz getting with that llama? â™ª

59:30.024 --> 59:33.653
â™ª Yeah
That shit gave my life all these traumas â™ª

59:33.736 --> 59:36.447
â™ª Yeah
I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª

59:36.531 --> 59:38.074
â™ª For my momma â™ª

59:38.157 --> 59:43.788
â™ª I'm trying to make it for my momma
I'm trying to make it for my momma â™ª

59:43.871 --> 59:47.292
â™ª I just want to make it for my grandma
You can have all the cars and shoes â™ª

59:47.375 --> 59:51.004
â™ª She works so hard in the a.m.
With no rest in the afternoon â™ª

59:51.087 --> 59:53.339
â™ª She raised three kids
All of them now in their 40s â™ª

59:53.423 --> 59:54.716
â™ª But two of them still in the house â™ª

59:54.799 --> 59:56.634
â™ª Bless her heart
She loves them to death â™ª

59:56.718 --> 59:58.386
â™ª But she ain't got the heart
To kick 'em out â™ª

59:58.469 --> 1:00:02.056
â™ª I got so many problems
I know I sound like a broken record â™ª

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:05.810
â™ª I told her help was coming soon
But now I gotta reschedule it â™ª

1:00:05.893 --> 1:00:07.812
â™ª I found a scholarship
Made it to college â™ª

1:00:07.895 --> 1:00:09.439
â™ª I told her that I was coming back
To get her â™ª

1:00:09.522 --> 1:00:11.357
â™ª She call every day
Telling me I'm her baby â™ª

1:00:11.441 --> 1:00:13.943
â™ª And most of all
That she gonna love me forever â™ª
