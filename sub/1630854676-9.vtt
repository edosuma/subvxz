WEBVTT

01:33.583 --> 01:37.333
According to Cid's coordinates,
this is the mine she purchased.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.875
And we're supposed to do what?

01:39.875 --> 01:44.208
Excavate the site for ipsium.
It is tremendously valuable when refined.

01:44.208 --> 01:49.041
However, in its raw state,
the mineral is highly combustible,

01:49.041 --> 01:50.916
like a primed thermal detonator.

01:52.375 --> 01:53.875
Sounds dangerous.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.916
I like it.

02:18.583 --> 02:19.583
Problem?

02:20.833 --> 02:23.666
The storm's moving away from us.
We should be fine.

02:24.708 --> 02:26.625
Tech, we'll mine the ipsium.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.250
Wrecker, Omega, you're on lookout.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.708
Both of us?

02:30.708 --> 02:32.416
Without Echo, we are a man down.

02:32.416 --> 02:36.583
We need Wrecker to assist
with operations inside the mine.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.541
You three go. I'll be the lookout.

02:39.541 --> 02:43.541
Not alone. Cid warned us
about poachers in the area.

02:43.541 --> 02:46.250
Keep your eyes peeled
and comm us if you see anyone.

03:08.166 --> 03:11.833
My scans are not indicating
a sizable presence of ipsium.

03:12.708 --> 03:16.958
Looks like Cid was deceived into
purchasing an already depleted mine.

03:16.958 --> 03:19.916
Keep scanning.
We'll extract whatever we can.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.291
Wait. I am getting a faint reading.

03:38.375 --> 03:39.375
There.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.291
The ipsium is going
to be difficult to reach.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.375
We'll need to carve out a bigger opening
in the rock to get to it.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.250
The mineral is far too unstable.

03:53.250 --> 03:57.333
Even the slightest friction around it
can cause a destructive chain reaction.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.541
Then what do you suggest?

04:11.916 --> 04:13.791
Hey. What's with you?

04:15.166 --> 04:16.833
I was thinking about Echo.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.708
It's weird without him around.

04:20.583 --> 04:24.500
Yeah. But you'll get used to it.

04:25.708 --> 04:28.583
<i>Omega, we require your assistance.</i>

04:28.583 --> 04:29.666
On my way.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.083
Now what?

04:44.083 --> 04:47.916
Drill into the fossilized quartz
until you reach the active ipsium inside.

04:48.583 --> 04:49.875
But you must be precise.

04:49.875 --> 04:52.916
If the mineral becomes compromised
during the retrieval...

04:52.916 --> 04:55.833
Chain reaction, explosion. Got it.

05:02.208 --> 05:05.250
Be very careful.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.625
I know.

05:35.791 --> 05:37.791
Good. Again.

06:07.666 --> 06:09.875
That storm's changing course.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.666
The weather patterns on this planet
are most irregular.

06:12.666 --> 06:16.125
We have what we came for.
Let's get back to Ord Mantell.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.750
What is it, Hunter?

06:25.041 --> 06:26.791
That sounds like our ship.

06:31.875 --> 06:32.958
Stop!

06:35.875 --> 06:37.916
You were supposed to be on lookout.

06:37.916 --> 06:39.500
There was no one there!

06:39.500 --> 06:41.166
Clearly that was not the case.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.958
There has to be a way
to get it back, right?

06:50.875 --> 06:52.166
Tell me, Wrecker,

06:52.166 --> 06:55.416
how exactly did you miss
our ship being compromised?

06:55.416 --> 06:59.916
Maybe if you hadn't docked it out of view,
I would have seen someone approaching.

06:59.916 --> 07:02.500
Well, there was no other
suitable landing zone, Wrecker.

07:03.166 --> 07:06.625
We can't stay here.
Where's the nearest town?

07:07.666 --> 07:12.250
During our approach, I scanned a spaceport
approximately 40 klicks south of here.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.583
Perhaps we can acquire transport there.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.625
You know how long
that would take?

07:16.625 --> 07:21.458
Since we do not have access to long-range
communications without our ship,

07:21.458 --> 07:23.250
it is our only option.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.333
Let's move.

07:51.625 --> 07:52.875
Whoo.

07:52.875 --> 07:54.416
How much further?

07:55.291 --> 07:56.916
You will not like the answer.

07:56.916 --> 08:00.416
Havoc-4, this is Havoc-5. Do you copy?

08:01.166 --> 08:02.875
Echo? Are you there?

08:02.875 --> 08:06.291
He's too long-range.
Echo won't pick up our signal.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.541
Especially since he disabled
his communication device.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.583
What? Why?

08:11.583 --> 08:13.958
I assume he's on a sensitive mission.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.500
What's that?

08:24.708 --> 08:25.708
Run!

08:43.791 --> 08:45.041
There.

08:54.958 --> 08:56.666
Wrecker!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.875
You must protect the ipsium case.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.250
Well, what about protecting me?

09:07.250 --> 09:09.833
If it explodes, we'll all be dead.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.333
My back!

09:40.333 --> 09:42.833
I would advise not dropping it next time.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.333
Why don't you carry it?

09:44.333 --> 09:45.416
Fine.

09:52.875 --> 09:56.583
Well, that would certainly
explain the stampede.

10:02.750 --> 10:03.916
Ow!

10:03.916 --> 10:06.083
Hey!

10:12.000 --> 10:13.625
We need to find shelter!

10:16.458 --> 10:19.125
There is another mine.
Thirty meters ahead.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.208
I see it!

10:32.083 --> 10:33.083
The case!

10:33.083 --> 10:34.458
Forget it!

10:42.875 --> 10:44.458
Where's the ipsium?

10:48.041 --> 10:49.333
Get down!

11:11.916 --> 11:14.166
So, now we are trapped.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.916
And we have lost all of our ipsium.

11:16.916 --> 11:20.375
Well, I-- I suppose that's my fault too?

11:20.375 --> 11:21.875
Well, technically, yes.

11:21.875 --> 11:24.208
If you had not let our ship get stolen,

11:24.208 --> 11:26.791
we would be aboard it right now
with the mineral.

11:27.291 --> 11:30.000
None of this is helping.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.041
Let's start digging our way outta here.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.208
Fine.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.416
Something's not right.

11:58.416 --> 12:01.625
The <i>Marauder's</i> transponder
isn't relaying a signal.

12:01.625 --> 12:06.916
It was probably disabled
by the thief who commandeered it.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.125
Well, then how are we gonna track it?

12:11.125 --> 12:14.750
The ship's not important right now.
We need to get outta here first.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.083
Quite correct.

12:16.083 --> 12:19.875
Besides, it is most unlikely
that the <i>Marauder</i> will be recovered.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.958
What? Don't say that.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.208
We have to get it back!

12:23.208 --> 12:25.541
We can always acquire another ship.

12:25.541 --> 12:27.791
It is merely a mode of transportation.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.250
The <i>Marauder's</i> our home.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.791
We already lost Echo.

12:31.791 --> 12:33.166
We can't lose that too.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.541
Omega, we didn't lose Echo.

12:38.541 --> 12:41.000
He's just on a different mission.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.875
But he's not here.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.208
He's-- He's not with us.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.000
We're supposed to be a squad.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.416
This squad existed before Echo was
a part of it, and it will exist after.

12:53.208 --> 12:54.458
What is your issue?

13:02.833 --> 13:04.875
- Omega--
- I want to be alone.

13:08.791 --> 13:10.291
I merely stated the truth.

13:10.291 --> 13:12.833
She already knows the truth.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.208
That's why she's upset.

15:05.041 --> 15:08.291
It'll take days
to clear a path at this rate.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.583
Complaining won't make it go faster.

15:10.583 --> 15:15.125
This operation could use
a well-placed detonation.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.458
A small amount of ipsium
would be more than enough.

15:19.458 --> 15:23.333
Well, we had a small amount,
but somebody dropped it.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.041
Fine.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.416
Since losing the mineral was my mistake,

15:28.416 --> 15:31.500
I'll search for any potential extractions
within this mine.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.958
That's not the only mistake
you need to fix.

15:34.958 --> 15:38.458
Yeah, go check on the kid.

15:38.458 --> 15:41.625
But she said she wanted to be alone.

15:41.625 --> 15:45.708
Look, she's clearly having a hard time
adjusting to Echo leaving.

15:46.541 --> 15:47.625
Talk to her.

15:49.458 --> 15:50.458
Very well.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.291
Omega?

16:44.625 --> 16:45.708
Omega?

16:47.375 --> 16:48.375
I'm busy.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.625
I can see that.

16:49.625 --> 16:53.541
Are you aware that you are surrounded
by enough ipsium that,

16:53.541 --> 16:57.458
if not handled correctly,
could take down this entire cavern?

16:58.375 --> 17:01.000
Then you better not distract me.

17:08.541 --> 17:11.416
Thought we could use this to
blow our way through the cave-in.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.791
I came to a similar conclusion myself.

17:14.791 --> 17:16.166
Little help?

17:16.166 --> 17:20.208
This vein appears to be much more pure
than what we found in Cid's mine.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.625
Perhaps you should extract
as much ipsium as you can.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.375
You trust me to do that?

17:27.041 --> 17:29.958
I am fully aware you are capable
of the task.

17:32.833 --> 17:34.875
Grab the empty vials from my satchel.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.625
How many are left?

17:46.625 --> 17:47.833
This is the last one.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.833
- Tech!
- Hang on!

18:21.166 --> 18:22.458
Omega!

19:03.083 --> 19:04.208
What is it, Hunter?

19:07.916 --> 19:08.916
Tech, come in.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.791
Omega, do you copy?

19:12.916 --> 19:14.083
Something's wrong.

20:14.541 --> 20:17.166
<i>Tech, Omega, do you copy?</i>

20:18.000 --> 20:20.541
Affirmative.

20:20.541 --> 20:23.958
We took an unforeseen detour,
but we are alive.

20:24.833 --> 20:25.833
<i>Where are you?</i>

20:27.375 --> 20:32.041
That is a good question. Stand by.

20:54.958 --> 20:56.458
Tech. Look.

20:59.625 --> 21:03.333
There is a passageway
just beyond this wall.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.375
We can use the ipsium you mined
to access it.

21:07.833 --> 21:11.916
Hunter, we found an alternate way out,
but you will need to retrieve our gear.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.041
Found it.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.166
All right, Tech.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.541
- We've got the gear and the ipsium.
- <i>Good.</i>

21:26.541 --> 21:29.625
<i>Next you'll need to carefully
scale down the narrow crevasse</i>

21:29.625 --> 21:31.666
<i>and descend into the aqueduct below.</i>

21:31.666 --> 21:35.125
You will come upon us once
the rapids eject you over the waterfall.

21:35.125 --> 21:39.250
<i>But you must not compromise
the mineral vials or you will perish.</i>

21:39.250 --> 21:40.875
You got to be kidding me!

21:40.875 --> 21:42.541
Hang tight. We're on our way.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.833
I hate this planet!

21:46.833 --> 21:49.083
We will be out of this cavern
in short order

21:49.083 --> 21:50.791
once they arrive with the mineral.

21:51.458 --> 21:55.666
Except we still don't have the <i>Marauder</i>
or a way off this planet,

21:55.666 --> 21:58.250
and we can't contact Echo for help.

21:58.791 --> 22:00.625
We do not need help.

22:00.625 --> 22:03.875
We will figure out a solution,
as we always do.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.333
Everything is changing,
and you don't even care.

22:10.083 --> 22:15.750
I am not sure how I should care
about change.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.708
It is a fundamental part of life.

22:18.708 --> 22:22.416
Echo left. Why doesn't that bother you?

22:27.125 --> 22:33.208
I am aware that you miss him,
but we have to adapt and move on.

22:33.833 --> 22:35.666
That is what soldiers do.

22:36.875 --> 22:38.458
We're more than that.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.875
We're a family.

22:40.875 --> 22:41.875
Aren't we?

22:42.625 --> 22:46.083
Well, uh, yes.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.666
Yes, of course we are.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.208
Then why don't you act like it?

23:01.958 --> 23:06.958
Echo chose a different path,
as did Crosshair.

23:08.333 --> 23:10.333
I have to respect their decision.

23:11.250 --> 23:15.666
Even though it can be difficult
to understand, we must carry on.

23:16.958 --> 23:21.833
I may process moments
and thoughts differently,

23:21.833 --> 23:24.916
but it does not mean
that I feel any less than you.

23:48.916 --> 23:50.666
See? That wasn't so bad.

24:05.541 --> 24:08.458
How come he gets to blow it up?

24:08.458 --> 24:12.291
If the shot is not precise,
it will cause another cave-in.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.291
That is the spaceport,

24:42.291 --> 24:45.000
but there does not appear
to be much activity.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.083
Well, there better be some chow there,
because I'm sick of rations.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.500
Let's check it out.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.125
Where is everyone?

25:18.125 --> 25:19.875
It's abandoned.

25:20.708 --> 25:22.708
For a while, by the look of it.

25:22.708 --> 25:25.125
We came all this way for nothing!

25:25.125 --> 25:26.333
Not nothing.

25:26.333 --> 25:30.166
I can send out a long-range transmission
with that array.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.625
<i>No can do, fellas.
I'm tied up at the moment.</i>

25:41.625 --> 25:43.833
<i>You'll have to figure it out yourselves.</i>

25:43.833 --> 25:47.166
Cid, you sent us on this mission.

25:47.166 --> 25:51.125
<i>Well, I didn't tell you
to get your ship stolen, did I?</i>

25:51.125 --> 25:53.416
Cid, we need your help.

25:53.958 --> 25:58.625
Just like we helped you regain control
of your parlor from Roland Durand,

25:58.625 --> 26:01.208
and when we cleared
your sizable debt with Millegi--

26:01.208 --> 26:03.583
<i>I didn't ask for a recap, Goggles.</i>

26:07.625 --> 26:12.041
<i>All right. Give me a few days,
and I'll see what I can do.</i>

26:12.041 --> 26:14.375
We don't have enough rations
to last a few--

26:16.625 --> 26:17.875
What do we do now?

26:20.041 --> 26:22.541
We'll figure it out, like we always do.
