02:13.280 --> 02:16.950
<i>The one born of great darkness.</i>

02:17.575 --> 02:22.163
<i>It is the black fire
that will reduce all to ashes.</i>

02:23.206 --> 02:27.544
<i>The dark power that dances in madness
inside the storm of chaos.</i>

02:29.212 --> 02:30.212
<i>However...</i>

02:30.714 --> 02:35.093
<i>After the fire dies,
the rich soil will be resurrected.</i>

02:36.011 --> 02:41.099
<i>The earth shall once again overflow
with abundance and joy.</i>

02:57.324 --> 02:59.534
If this is just as Yggdrasil planned,

02:59.909 --> 03:03.955
our world will be swallowed
by the Digital World.

03:54.464 --> 03:55.965
<i>Taichi...</i>

04:16.486 --> 04:18.404
<i>We were always together.</i>

04:22.867 --> 04:24.744
<i>On that stormy day.</i>

04:25.412 --> 04:27.205
<i>On that clear day.</i>

04:28.164 --> 04:29.457
<i>On rainy days.</i>

04:30.166 --> 04:31.543
<i>On days you struggled.</i>

04:32.210 --> 04:33.795
<i>On days you were angry.</i>

04:35.422 --> 04:37.549
<i>I was always watching.</i>

05:15.712 --> 05:17.046
<i>Taichi!</i>

05:18.715 --> 05:20.300
<i>Taichi.</i>

05:21.676 --> 05:24.512
<i>Time to get up.</i>

05:24.679 --> 05:26.723
<i>Come on.</i>

05:34.105 --> 05:35.440
Hikari-chan!

05:44.657 --> 05:45.992
Are you okay?

05:46.159 --> 05:47.285
Yeah.

06:09.557 --> 06:10.558
Look at that.

06:17.148 --> 06:18.399
Is that Odaiba?

06:18.566 --> 06:19.650
Looks like it.

06:19.651 --> 06:21.402
There's distortions everywhere.

06:25.156 --> 06:29.202
The boundary between the Real
and Digital World is disappearing.

06:30.370 --> 06:34.499
If that happens,
we can go to the Real World all we want.

06:34.666 --> 06:36.417
I can see Joe anytime too!

06:36.584 --> 06:41.965
I'm afraid the problem is whether the
Real World will still be left by then.

06:42.131 --> 06:46.844
If everything's swallowed by the Digital
World, it'll be just what Yggdrasil wants.

06:49.556 --> 06:51.558
I won't let that happen.

06:52.141 --> 06:55.937
What I'm concerned about
is Homeostasis' next move.

06:56.229 --> 06:59.440
Meicoomon absorbed
the dark evolved Ophanimon...

07:00.441 --> 07:02.569
...and has grown even stronger.

07:04.654 --> 07:09.116
Homeostasis, the one who desires stability
and harmony, won't let this go.

07:09.117 --> 07:11.035
That is true.

07:11.202 --> 07:12.704
We need to find Mei-chan.

07:19.294 --> 07:22.880
That distortion seems to be
connected to the Real World.

07:23.089 --> 07:24.674
We can use it to return.

07:35.184 --> 07:36.184
Let's go.

08:14.515 --> 08:15.557
It's okay.

08:15.558 --> 08:16.558
What?

08:17.560 --> 08:18.978
Go save Taichi.

08:21.064 --> 08:24.400
We'll manage by ourselves from here on.

08:24.692 --> 08:26.527
Don't you wanna look for Taichi?

08:26.694 --> 08:28.529
No, it's alright.

08:29.155 --> 08:33.241
Right now, there's something more
important we got to do to save the world.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.835
It just hasn't hit me yet...

08:45.463 --> 08:47.507
About Mr. Nishijima.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.468
About Meicoomon and Gatomon...

08:52.637 --> 08:54.138
...and about Taichi.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.770
Me neither.

09:03.940 --> 09:05.525
Say, Yamato.

09:07.568 --> 09:10.904
Can I just get something off my chest?

09:10.905 --> 09:11.905
Sure.

09:19.163 --> 09:21.332
Taichi's okay, right?

09:23.334 --> 09:26.462
Taichi wouldn't die, would he?

09:48.151 --> 09:49.151
Sorry.

09:51.696 --> 09:52.696
You okay?

09:52.989 --> 09:54.157
Thanks.

09:54.407 --> 09:56.033
Sora!

09:57.702 --> 09:58.911
Sora!

10:00.246 --> 10:01.289
You made her cry?!

10:01.456 --> 10:02.749
No, no!

10:02.915 --> 10:07.420
What's wrong, Sora? Did Yamato bully you?
Did he sing you a cheesy love song?!

10:07.587 --> 10:08.379
I wouldn't sing!

10:08.546 --> 10:09.797
You would!

10:17.889 --> 10:19.557
Taichi...

10:21.851 --> 10:23.269
The damages are enormous.

10:23.436 --> 10:28.858
Blackouts and chaos on digital devices
are occurring simultaneously worldwide.

10:29.275 --> 10:32.028
Furthermore, all over the world,

10:32.195 --> 10:37.033
extremely aggressive Digimons continue
their destructive behavior as we speak.

10:37.450 --> 10:43.372
We can assume this is part of an invasion
on the Real World by the Digital World.

10:44.749 --> 10:46.959
We need a countermeasure at once.

10:47.543 --> 10:50.379
We should cooperate with
each nation's military.

10:59.055 --> 10:59.847
"OUTBOX"

11:00.014 --> 11:02.391
"To: Meiko
Contact me when you return safely."

11:02.558 --> 11:04.352
"MESSAGE SENT"

11:06.354 --> 11:10.399
Unfortunately, this is a situation
that cannot be controlled by humans.

11:12.860 --> 11:14.153
What has happened?!

11:14.320 --> 11:18.157
Homeostasis has failed in
the removal of Libra.

11:39.178 --> 11:43.891
Ordinemon was born
and world harmony was lost.

11:44.350 --> 11:45.852
What about Meiko?

11:46.018 --> 11:47.687
Are the children okay?

11:47.854 --> 11:51.858
Homeostasis does not wish for
any more damage.

11:53.734 --> 11:57.029
In order to force an end
to all this chaos,

11:57.196 --> 12:01.742
there's no other way but to
put our final plan in motion.

12:03.619 --> 12:07.790
If we do not stop Ordinemon,
this world does not have a future.

12:10.251 --> 12:14.338
This is the only option
mankind has been left with.

12:14.505 --> 12:18.342
If this is not executed,
the world will definitely crumble.

12:18.843 --> 12:21.304
There is no time for
pointless resistance.

12:38.696 --> 12:40.114
What is this?

12:40.281 --> 12:41.824
What's going on?

12:42.575 --> 12:48.122
A state of emergency has just been
issued for all of Tokyo Waterfront City.

12:48.539 --> 12:52.668
All residents, please refrain
from going outdoors.

12:54.921 --> 12:58.633
There's no detailed information out
on Meicoomon yet.

12:59.050 --> 13:00.718
She's not over here?

13:00.885 --> 13:02.511
I hope not.

13:02.762 --> 13:03.971
But...

13:04.305 --> 13:06.974
Meicoomon disappeared into
the distortion for sure.

13:07.141 --> 13:09.517
Where is she right now?

13:09.518 --> 13:10.728
I don't know.

13:10.895 --> 13:13.773
But she's a Digimon that powerful.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.859
We need to stop her
before she shows up over here.

13:17.026 --> 13:18.527
It's...

13:19.445 --> 13:20.821
...my fault.

13:24.158 --> 13:25.618
It's my...

13:26.994 --> 13:28.037
Hikari-san!

13:31.082 --> 13:33.459
Taichi, where are you?

13:34.627 --> 13:36.295
Come back...

13:45.554 --> 13:47.640
Why are you crying, Mimi?

13:47.807 --> 13:49.809
Because... Because...

13:50.226 --> 13:53.479
Taichi...

13:54.021 --> 13:55.481
What's wrong?!

13:55.648 --> 13:56.648
Hikari-chan!

13:56.941 --> 13:58.734
She has a terrible fever.

13:59.735 --> 14:01.236
Is she alright?

14:01.237 --> 14:03.489
She must've been pushing herself.

14:06.325 --> 14:10.496
I don't know how to apologize
to Hikari-san...

14:13.124 --> 14:18.254
Since all this is because me and Mei-chan
got everyone involved in the first place.

14:18.421 --> 14:20.089
Let's stop that.

14:20.256 --> 14:22.008
None of that!

14:22.717 --> 14:25.594
Let's not think of the bad or the good.

14:25.761 --> 14:28.764
Let's just look forward for now.

14:31.934 --> 14:34.437
I'll take Hikari-chan to lie down.

14:46.073 --> 14:47.783
We'll make up for Taichi.

14:52.246 --> 14:53.414
Joe...

14:54.582 --> 14:55.958
What's up, Gomamon?

14:56.125 --> 14:58.169
Look at Koromon.

15:00.963 --> 15:03.007
Whoa, oh no!

15:03.174 --> 15:05.926
Are you okay? There, there.

15:06.093 --> 15:08.721
Maybe he's starving
because he fought a lot?

15:08.888 --> 15:12.308
They say you can't whatchamacallit
on an empty stomach.

15:12.850 --> 15:17.313
Do you want to eat
or do you want to take a bath first?

15:17.480 --> 15:19.774
My, you sound like a young housewife.

15:19.940 --> 15:22.318
Food! Food!

15:22.735 --> 15:23.986
- Yay, food!
- Food!

15:24.153 --> 15:25.279
Food!

15:25.488 --> 15:27.114
Food!!

15:59.396 --> 16:00.648
Taichi...

16:05.194 --> 16:07.863
Don't disappear at a time like this!

16:09.240 --> 16:10.533
I'm here!

16:11.408 --> 16:12.408
Gabumon?

16:13.119 --> 16:15.412
I grew after I ate a lot.

16:20.376 --> 16:24.713
Yamato, don't you know that phrase
in Digimon Karuta?

16:24.880 --> 16:26.382
Huh? Karuta?

16:26.924 --> 16:30.386
"If you're in trouble,
ask your partner Digimon for advice."

16:30.553 --> 16:33.639
No, this is my first time hearing it.

16:33.806 --> 16:38.352
Well of course,
I only made it up just now.

16:42.606 --> 16:43.941
Yamato!

16:45.276 --> 16:48.237
I'm here for you. Tell me everything.

16:48.445 --> 16:50.656
If you're lonely or in pain.

16:53.659 --> 16:58.497
I'll always be by your side.
Even if you refuse, I'll stay with you.

17:00.624 --> 17:05.838
If you get married and have a baby,
I'll take care of it.

17:06.005 --> 17:06.839
Huh?!

17:07.006 --> 17:10.885
When you become a middle-aged man,
I'll go to the sauna with you.

17:11.050 --> 17:14.597
When you become a grandpa,
I'll take a walk with you.

17:14.888 --> 17:16.473
What's with that?

17:16.640 --> 17:23.314
Yamato, if you'll continue to need me
even when you grow up...

17:23.480 --> 17:25.733
I'll always...

17:28.569 --> 17:31.155
I'll be able to do anything.

17:34.325 --> 17:36.160
I'll even save the world.

17:38.329 --> 17:39.330
That's enough.

17:41.123 --> 17:42.499
I got it.

17:45.211 --> 17:48.297
I think I can understand now.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.303
What Taichi said before...

17:55.221 --> 18:00.601
Still hung up? It's not like you.
Not like you used to be.

18:00.935 --> 18:02.436
I can't help it.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.439
I'm not what I was.

18:10.903 --> 18:15.199
Now I see more
and understand less.

18:17.034 --> 18:20.537
I'm not sure if what
we're doing is right.

18:21.413 --> 18:22.623
Or maybe...

18:23.958 --> 18:25.626
We're doing wrong.

18:35.552 --> 18:38.389
I know only we can do it.

18:38.889 --> 18:41.642
But it's not that simple.

18:45.271 --> 18:47.481
That's just running away.

18:52.861 --> 18:55.072
The fear of losing something important.

18:56.573 --> 18:58.242
After Taichi disappeared...

19:00.577 --> 19:01.577
I...

19:03.122 --> 19:04.456
Yamato.

19:06.583 --> 19:09.628
You're the only one that
could replace Taichi.

19:10.004 --> 19:13.090
I'm sure Taichi would want that too.

19:15.884 --> 19:17.970
Yamato, you understand.

19:28.439 --> 19:30.149
Don't cry.

19:31.025 --> 19:32.484
Don't make me cry.

19:52.671 --> 19:54.506
You little...

20:00.679 --> 20:03.057
Jeez, those guys...

20:03.223 --> 20:04.223
Huh?

20:09.188 --> 20:10.189
A distortion?!

20:15.194 --> 20:16.278
Yamato!

20:18.864 --> 20:19.864
Yeah.

20:50.479 --> 20:51.814
Is that...?!

21:15.170 --> 21:16.755
Meicoomon has appeared!

21:19.925 --> 21:24.972
This is a highly dangerous situation!
Everyone in the area evacuate immediately!

22:04.011 --> 22:07.806
Why would you create such
a troublesome creature?

22:08.265 --> 22:10.976
Well, it's just as I planned.

22:11.477 --> 22:14.062
That's it, go! Do more!

22:14.688 --> 22:16.607
Destroy everything!

22:16.773 --> 22:19.067
It's a rotten trashy world anyway.

22:19.610 --> 22:22.571
It's even too much for
all you humans to handle!

22:23.197 --> 22:26.658
I'll end it all for you
by crushing everything!

22:27.951 --> 22:31.580
It's the birth of a new world
controlled by Yggdrasil!

22:31.747 --> 22:35.083
Congratulations,
all you savage beasts of the world!

22:38.253 --> 22:42.925
Anyone in the vicinity, please stay calm
and look to your own safety first.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.307
Anything from Taichi or Hikari?

22:50.474 --> 22:52.059
No, not yet.

22:52.226 --> 22:54.561
I can't get through either.

23:09.493 --> 23:13.622
Don't worry, those kids have
gotten through every time.

23:15.290 --> 23:17.125
All we can do is believe.

23:17.292 --> 23:18.293
Yes.

23:21.880 --> 23:23.340
Dance!

23:25.342 --> 23:27.261
Dance more!

23:30.764 --> 23:32.391
Dance!!

23:51.577 --> 23:54.913
Stay calm!
Please stay calm as you evacuate!

24:06.508 --> 24:07.676
Isn't that...

24:07.843 --> 24:09.428
Meicoomon?!

24:09.970 --> 24:14.099
She absorbed Ophanimon
and now, what a sight...

24:14.558 --> 24:16.935
Mei-chan...

24:26.987 --> 24:28.196
Let's go, Gabumon!

24:28.363 --> 24:29.363
Okay!

24:41.960 --> 24:44.296
Evolution!

25:03.273 --> 25:07.986
Garurumon! Togemon! Birdramon!
Kabuterimon! Ikkakumon!

25:18.955 --> 25:23.168
Super evolution!

25:32.302 --> 25:37.182
WereGarurumon! MegaKabuterimon!
Lilymon! Garudamon! Zudomon!

25:37.599 --> 25:39.851
Go!!

25:54.950 --> 25:57.452
You're still using that form?

25:57.619 --> 26:00.455
Looks like the fusion of the worlds
isn't moving.

26:01.748 --> 26:03.959
Homeostasis' dog...

26:04.668 --> 26:06.211
What're you here for?

26:06.628 --> 26:09.131
Did you come to watch the brutal show?

26:09.589 --> 26:13.301
The last dance of useless resistance
by those who are dying out.

26:13.468 --> 26:17.556
We desire the harmony
and stability of the world.

26:19.391 --> 26:23.395
Hey, hey, so what is this
world harmony and stability?

26:23.562 --> 26:26.940
You end up ruining everything,
so aren't you just the same as us?

26:27.107 --> 26:29.359
We have different beliefs than you.

26:29.526 --> 26:32.946
Homeostasis is world order itself.

26:35.741 --> 26:40.912
Beautiful! So you say these noble things,
but end up majorly betraying everyone?

26:41.079 --> 26:43.206
I love those type of games.

26:43.874 --> 26:46.460
Home-chan, I dig how you're so cruel!

26:49.629 --> 26:53.633
It seems like Ordinemon
still barely has its conscience.

26:53.925 --> 26:56.470
It's giving response to its partners.

26:56.845 --> 27:00.974
Who gives! Everyone's gonna
disappear anyway.

27:01.141 --> 27:04.728
It's useless for Homeostasis to do
anything at this point.

27:11.902 --> 27:15.947
Anything unfavorable is destroyed.
Who cares about beliefs!

27:16.114 --> 27:17.741
Cheers to Yggdrasil!

27:48.605 --> 27:50.023
So strong!

27:53.193 --> 27:54.193
Let's go!

27:55.195 --> 27:59.866
Ultimate evolution!

28:12.629 --> 28:17.133
MetalGarurumon! HerculesKabuterimon!
Phoenixmon! Rosemon! Vikemon!

28:18.343 --> 28:21.179
Arctic Blizzard!

28:24.516 --> 28:26.518
Garuru Tomahawk!

28:27.978 --> 28:31.022
Star-Light Explosion!

28:31.815 --> 28:34.359
Forbidden Temptation!

28:35.569 --> 28:37.571
Mega Electro Shocker!

28:42.158 --> 28:43.158
What?!

28:44.160 --> 28:45.453
It's not working?

28:45.704 --> 28:47.289
No way...

29:26.494 --> 29:27.578
So strong!

29:27.579 --> 29:29.331
DigiDestined.

29:32.500 --> 29:37.839
I am Homeostasis' messenger,
as well as your friend.

29:41.843 --> 29:42.928
Hackmon.

29:43.094 --> 29:44.596
And his ultimate form is...

29:46.765 --> 29:48.099
Jesmon?!

30:00.403 --> 30:02.072
You were that little...!

30:04.032 --> 30:07.702
What do you want?! It's your fault
Taichi-san and Mr. Nishijima...

30:07.869 --> 30:08.954
Mimi-kun!

30:09.663 --> 30:13.750
Yggdrasil called Libra
the key to destroying the world.

30:14.459 --> 30:18.380
If that were true,
the newly born Ordinemon...

30:18.546 --> 30:23.426
...would be the key to destroying both
the Digital and Real World.

30:26.554 --> 30:28.098
Ordinemon?

30:29.182 --> 30:32.227
It is not an opponent all of you
can stand up against.

30:32.394 --> 30:35.605
It cannot even control its own
overwhelming powers.

30:35.772 --> 30:39.526
With nowhere to go,
it is a pitiful wandering threat.

30:40.193 --> 30:44.406
Homeostasis has already
started the final project.

30:44.864 --> 30:48.284
We don't intend on letting Yggdrasil
continue any further.

30:48.451 --> 30:50.286
The final project?

30:51.037 --> 30:53.540
A reboot of the Real World.

30:56.710 --> 30:58.128
Reboot...

30:59.713 --> 31:04.217
The Real and Digital World's
core grammars are different.

31:04.509 --> 31:10.598
That became the difference between
the originally parallel worlds.

31:11.808 --> 31:15.602
However, the Real World's digital data
is already taken over...

31:15.603 --> 31:17.856
...by the grammar of the Digital World.

31:18.023 --> 31:20.567
And that system is about
to be overwritten.

31:20.984 --> 31:24.821
To our calculation, everything will be
overwritten in 94,524 seconds...

31:25.238 --> 31:28.825
...and the Real World will become
modified back into the quantum sea.

31:29.242 --> 31:30.452
What?!

31:31.953 --> 31:36.332
In order to stop this, there's no choice
but to reboot the Real World.

31:36.916 --> 31:38.960
But didn't the reboot end already?

31:39.127 --> 31:42.839
Does that mean Digimons' memories
will be wiped out again?!

31:43.006 --> 31:49.721
No, that should be okay, because of the
backup field I created before.

31:50.263 --> 31:54.684
More importantly, if all digital devices
returned to their original state,

31:54.851 --> 31:57.103
that damage would be immeasurable.

31:57.270 --> 31:58.521
If it succeeds,

31:58.688 --> 32:01.941
the "key to destroying the world"
will also return to its original state.

32:02.108 --> 32:06.362
The reboot of the Real World
is mankind's last hope.

32:09.407 --> 32:11.951
So we have no choice but to accept it?

32:12.410 --> 32:14.496
To save the Real World?

32:35.517 --> 32:39.104
I wonder what Taichi would say.

32:42.232 --> 32:46.611
If it were him, he'd choose the path
with the least damage.

32:55.787 --> 32:57.122
I'm against this!

32:57.539 --> 33:01.292
Electricity, gas, water, finance,
aviation, railways, health care...

33:01.459 --> 33:04.838
...as well as space, nuclear related,
and government agencies...

33:05.004 --> 33:08.133
Everywhere in the entire world
is digitized already!

33:08.299 --> 33:10.635
A reboot has too much risk!

33:11.427 --> 33:12.637
I won't give up.

33:13.138 --> 33:15.932
I'll look for a different route
until the end!

33:17.058 --> 33:18.351
Koushiro!

33:21.062 --> 33:24.649
The reboot will begin
by Homeostasis' will.

33:25.650 --> 33:30.738
In the meantime, we cannot let
Ordinemon go rampant here.

33:30.905 --> 33:33.158
Can you lure it to the ocean?

33:33.741 --> 33:35.660
M-Me?

33:42.292 --> 33:44.419
It's true the damage is worse here.

33:46.129 --> 33:50.675
If we lead her to an open space,
there'd be less damage to nearby areas.

33:52.177 --> 33:53.178
Okay.

33:56.347 --> 33:57.599
I'll try.

34:03.605 --> 34:05.315
Is everyone alright?

34:05.481 --> 34:07.442
Here, here, I got some food.

34:07.609 --> 34:10.445
Eat lots and feel better!

34:10.987 --> 34:13.947
Phew, I feel alive now!

34:14.364 --> 34:16.367
Thank you, Joe.

34:22.623 --> 34:24.667
Agumon's eating the most.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.212
I got to eat lots and get energized...

34:27.670 --> 34:30.465
...for when Taichi comes back.

34:33.551 --> 34:34.551
Agumon...

34:36.929 --> 34:39.933
Aww! You make me cry!

34:40.099 --> 34:42.060
That's right! Let's have faith.

34:42.226 --> 34:46.022
I'm sure Gatomon and Meicoomon,
and everyone will come back!

34:46.188 --> 34:49.734
Yeah, we'll all meet again. For sure!

34:59.994 --> 35:00.995
It's no use.

35:01.162 --> 35:03.998
Something... Anything...
I got to find it!

35:04.165 --> 35:07.001
A way to avoid the reboot. Something!

35:08.336 --> 35:09.545
Some way!

35:28.439 --> 35:31.109
This happened before.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.945
When the Digital World was rebooted.

35:34.696 --> 35:37.198
Oh, is that so?

35:37.365 --> 35:40.285
Sorry, I don't remember it.

35:40.451 --> 35:43.496
Oh yeah, that's right.

36:26.664 --> 36:27.957
You alright?

36:28.416 --> 36:29.542
Yagami.

36:32.503 --> 36:33.546
Mr. Nishijima!

36:37.508 --> 36:38.760
Mr. Nishijima!

36:47.268 --> 36:48.728
I'm glad...

36:49.854 --> 36:51.522
...you're okay.

36:52.690 --> 36:55.109
M-Mr. Nishijima...

37:01.616 --> 37:02.992
Don't push yourself.

37:03.534 --> 37:04.619
Where are we?

37:04.786 --> 37:06.120
Who knows.

37:06.454 --> 37:09.123
I think it's somewhere
in the Digital World though...

37:32.939 --> 37:35.233
Daisuke! Everyone!

37:37.985 --> 37:39.153
Are they okay?

37:39.320 --> 37:40.446
Yeah.

37:41.197 --> 37:42.657
They're just asleep.

37:44.033 --> 37:45.034
To be honest...

37:46.202 --> 37:49.664
There's a big secret we've been
keeping from you guys.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.793
Daisuke Motomiya.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.294
Ken Ichijouji.

37:55.461 --> 37:56.796
Miyako Inoue.

37:56.963 --> 37:58.339
Iori Hida.

37:58.506 --> 38:01.467
These four have all been missing.

38:03.302 --> 38:08.641
I was ordered to hide that fact and
forced to control all the information.

38:10.309 --> 38:11.811
How did it happen?

38:12.728 --> 38:16.315
They were removed
after they found out Yggdrasil's plan.

38:17.233 --> 38:20.361
Officer Himekawa was the one
who gave me the order.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.697
She joined hands with Yggdrasil.

38:24.031 --> 38:28.327
Hime-chan's Digimon was sacrificed
in a past battle.

38:28.494 --> 38:31.998
She wanted to revive
her partner Digimon with the reboot.

38:32.165 --> 38:34.375
That was her goal.

38:35.418 --> 38:37.253
She did whatever it took.

38:37.420 --> 38:41.007
She bet on the reboot
to regain the bond she had lost.

38:42.175 --> 38:43.676
Was she able to?

38:44.886 --> 38:46.888
Well, I don't know.

38:48.931 --> 38:51.225
I don't even know if she's alive.

38:51.976 --> 38:58.024
Partner Digimons could at times save
people, but could also drive them mad.

38:58.316 --> 39:03.362
If I had stopped Hime-chan much earlier,
this would've never...

39:07.158 --> 39:11.370
No matter how difficult it is,
you have to make a decision sometimes.

39:13.498 --> 39:16.334
Even if you're up against a friend.

39:18.002 --> 39:21.214
Please kill Mei-chan.

39:24.842 --> 39:26.969
He who fights monsters...

39:27.136 --> 39:30.556
...should be careful that he does not
become a monster himself.

39:33.184 --> 39:39.899
If you gaze long into an abyss,
the abyss also gazes into you.

39:50.451 --> 39:52.828
The life support system halted?!

39:52.995 --> 39:57.124
If you want to save them,
just send them to the Real World.

39:57.291 --> 39:58.291
But,

39:58.417 --> 40:03.005
as soon as you do that,
this place goes boom!

40:05.550 --> 40:11.180
Your seats have been prepared, thanks to
the merciful Yggdrasil-sama.

40:11.347 --> 40:13.349
Oh, wait...

40:13.683 --> 40:19.272
There was only one seat! Agh, I'm sorry!

40:28.155 --> 40:31.242
Learn how helpless you humans are!

40:31.409 --> 40:36.080
Face it, none of you can do anything
without Digimons!

40:36.247 --> 40:40.293
You're just clowns who've been
basking in reflected glory! Clowns!

40:40.459 --> 40:44.505
Now show me your
pathetic last struggling cries!

40:44.672 --> 40:46.549
You DigiDestined brats!

40:53.681 --> 40:56.767
Take that, humans!

41:02.273 --> 41:03.024
Yagami...

41:03.190 --> 41:05.818
There's got to be something. Has to be!

41:05.985 --> 41:08.237
A way to save everyone!

41:28.591 --> 41:30.760
Check the transfer device.

41:31.594 --> 41:36.098
If we can transport to the Real World,
we might able to communicate through it.

41:36.265 --> 41:37.266
Okay.

41:47.401 --> 41:49.527
Preparing to transfer.

41:49.528 --> 41:50.528
What?

42:00.956 --> 42:03.292
I'm counting on you, Yagami.

42:12.259 --> 42:13.259
Mr. Nishijima!

42:13.386 --> 42:14.386
Go.

42:16.972 --> 42:17.848
Open up!

42:17.849 --> 42:18.974
You must go.

42:21.435 --> 42:22.603
I haven't given up.

42:22.770 --> 42:24.562
Open this, Mr. Nishijima!

42:24.563 --> 42:30.027
You guys taught me that there's
always something I can do until the end.

42:31.320 --> 42:34.573
The future will continue
and become connected.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.742
I'll pass it on to you.

42:37.076 --> 42:38.953
Our...

42:40.913 --> 42:42.331
Our grown up...

42:44.083 --> 42:45.292
...hope.

42:49.004 --> 42:50.840
Mr. Nishijima!

42:51.424 --> 42:52.967
Listen, Yagami.

42:53.509 --> 42:58.013
No matter how hard reality is up ahead,
don't ever give up.

42:58.431 --> 43:00.641
You guys go build the future.

43:04.186 --> 43:05.521
Dream...

43:06.439 --> 43:07.857
...big!

44:01.076 --> 44:03.913
Meimei, are you really okay?

44:04.371 --> 44:05.915
We'll be with you.

44:06.081 --> 44:08.918
Yes, thank you.

44:09.376 --> 44:10.795
We're here too!

44:10.961 --> 44:12.004
Leave it to us!

44:12.171 --> 44:13.923
But you know...

44:14.423 --> 44:18.427
That's Gatomon and Meicoomon too.

44:24.016 --> 44:28.437
How can we save them?
Meicoomon and Gatomon.

44:28.604 --> 44:30.689
Hmm...

44:40.115 --> 44:41.951
Everything's acting weird.

44:42.785 --> 44:44.662
It's Ordinemon's influence.

44:50.626 --> 44:52.962
What do I need to do here?

44:53.629 --> 44:55.714
You do not need to do anything.

44:56.048 --> 45:02.972
If our theory is correct, Ordinemon will
automatically move according to you.

45:03.138 --> 45:05.099
Are you sure about that?

45:06.141 --> 45:08.978
The Mei-chan now...

45:09.603 --> 45:13.858
I don't know if she even
remembers me in that form.

45:14.024 --> 45:18.737
The partnership between Digimons
and humans has infinite possibility.

45:18.904 --> 45:21.699
We would not be surprised
by anything that happens.

45:23.075 --> 45:26.412
Is Homeostasis our ally?

45:26.579 --> 45:27.746
Or our enemy?

45:27.913 --> 45:31.250
Homeostasis is the one who desires
stability and harmony.

45:33.419 --> 45:37.006
Do you want to protect Mei-chan
or remove her?

45:37.923 --> 45:39.757
I don't understand at all.

45:39.758 --> 45:43.262
I don't know how far you're thinking
about this world either.

45:45.639 --> 45:50.185
I'm sorry, I don't have the fight
to be saying this.

45:50.644 --> 45:53.188
After putting the world
into such chaos...

45:56.942 --> 45:58.777
There is no need to apologize.

45:58.944 --> 46:02.781
We have got all of you involved
because of our own reasons.

46:03.657 --> 46:06.493
The reboot is not my
true intention either.

46:16.670 --> 46:17.922
Mei-chan...

46:31.685 --> 46:32.978
She's started to move.

46:36.690 --> 46:37.691
Is this okay...?

46:37.858 --> 46:38.567
Why?

46:38.734 --> 46:42.237
The reboot is going
to start at this rate.

46:42.571 --> 46:46.158
If the Real World is rebooted,
it's gonna be complete chaos.

46:46.325 --> 46:48.494
Yeah, no mistake.

46:48.661 --> 46:52.039
The world's probably going to face
a catastrophic crisis.

46:52.206 --> 46:53.332
But...

46:53.499 --> 46:56.502
Yggdrasil or Homeostasis,

46:56.669 --> 47:00.589
the world won't be saved
by either of their ways.

47:03.759 --> 47:09.598
I wonder what'll happen to Meicoomon and
Gatomon who was taken into Ordinemon.

47:10.099 --> 47:11.392
We don't know either.

47:11.558 --> 47:12.851
Very sorry.

47:16.480 --> 47:17.648
Koushiro?

47:17.815 --> 47:18.857
What's up?

47:19.024 --> 47:23.612
Daisuke-kun and the others imprisoned in
the Digital World were all found earlier.

47:23.779 --> 47:24.779
What?!

47:24.905 --> 47:29.034
I don't know the details. They seem to
have been carried to the hospital.

47:29.201 --> 47:35.666
But what's important is that someone
inside the Digital World saved them.

47:50.556 --> 47:51.807
Hikari.

47:51.974 --> 47:52.974
Are you okay?

48:01.066 --> 48:02.151
Thank you.

48:02.317 --> 48:03.902
You were having a nightmare.

48:06.530 --> 48:08.907
I want to disappear too...

48:09.074 --> 48:10.409
Hikari-chan!

48:12.327 --> 48:14.747
Why do you put it all on your shoulders?

48:14.913 --> 48:16.415
Don't close yourself off!

48:19.585 --> 48:22.171
I'm worried about you.

48:28.343 --> 48:32.431
Don't worry, Takeru, I'm not looking.
I'm not looking at all!

48:35.934 --> 48:37.644
What was that just now?!

48:47.613 --> 48:48.822
Gatomon...

48:49.198 --> 48:50.949
I got to go too.

48:54.119 --> 48:55.454
Mei-chan!

49:39.665 --> 49:42.501
Now, show them what you got!

49:42.668 --> 49:44.670
Destroy everything and be reborn!

49:44.837 --> 49:50.759
Listen to this grand symphony of
destruction, perfect for mankind's end!

49:54.680 --> 49:57.015
All hail Yggdrasil!

50:09.444 --> 50:10.654
Mei-chan...

50:10.988 --> 50:12.072
Gatomon...

50:12.489 --> 50:13.782
Are you guys there?

50:15.701 --> 50:18.787
Are there still memories left in you?

50:18.954 --> 50:19.954
Gatomon!

50:20.080 --> 50:21.080
Meicoomon!

50:25.002 --> 50:28.797
We don't want to hurt
Meicoomon or Gatomon, but...

50:29.840 --> 50:32.009
We got to stop them if they do wrong!

50:33.552 --> 50:34.553
Gabumon.

50:34.970 --> 50:35.804
Yeah.

50:35.971 --> 50:39.057
I can't evolve right now, so...

50:39.516 --> 50:42.561
I know. If the time comes, I'm prepared.

50:43.312 --> 50:46.689
There are some things
that only us, friends, can do.

50:46.690 --> 50:47.691
Yeah.

50:50.068 --> 50:51.195
Yeah.

50:53.822 --> 50:55.824
I know Yamato's thinking hard.

50:56.658 --> 50:58.827
I believe in him.

51:04.041 --> 51:08.128
Let's work together for
Gatomon and Meicoomon.

51:15.844 --> 51:17.596
It's no use. It won't work.

52:16.780 --> 52:17.864
Stop it!

52:18.031 --> 52:19.408
They're attacking her...

52:19.574 --> 52:21.410
They're gonna get involved at this rate!

53:02.367 --> 53:03.994
Gabumon, I'm counting on you!

53:04.161 --> 53:04.953
Leave it to me!

53:05.120 --> 53:06.162
Gomamon!

53:06.163 --> 53:06.705
Got it!

53:06.872 --> 53:07.873
Palmon!

53:08.040 --> 53:08.790
I'll do my best!

53:08.957 --> 53:10.417
Biyomon, please!

53:10.584 --> 53:11.584
Okay!

53:24.222 --> 53:26.892
Evolution!

53:46.036 --> 53:50.999
Garurumon! Birdramon!
Togemon! Ikkakumon!

54:01.510 --> 54:04.429
Garurumon super evolution!

54:14.523 --> 54:16.608
WereGarurumon!

55:13.915 --> 55:14.915
Watch out!

55:15.333 --> 55:16.751
Patamon, let's go!

55:16.918 --> 55:17.918
Okay!

55:30.265 --> 55:32.392
Patamon evolution!

55:52.370 --> 55:53.705
Angemon!

56:05.634 --> 56:08.512
Angemon super evolution!

56:19.397 --> 56:21.358
MagnaAngemon!

56:31.993 --> 56:33.745
Digimons are everywhere...

56:33.912 --> 56:37.457
Yggdrasil sent them over
to destroy the Real World.

56:51.721 --> 56:52.847
You're...

56:55.225 --> 56:59.604
Well, well, I'm surprised
you haven't lost all hope.

56:59.771 --> 57:02.607
The ill-omened goddess,
summoner of destruction.

57:04.776 --> 57:07.445
It's an honor to meet you again.

57:07.612 --> 57:11.783
The one who refused Homeostasis' prophecy
and cornered their own brother...

57:12.701 --> 57:16.037
You're the one who gave us the chance
to destroy this world.

57:16.204 --> 57:17.288
Stop!

57:17.289 --> 57:21.543
Humans are a fragile existence
just like this world.

57:21.710 --> 57:26.131
Incomplete beings that can't even control
their own emotions just get in the way.

57:26.590 --> 57:27.632
Delete.

57:29.301 --> 57:30.635
Delete.

57:32.304 --> 57:34.681
Delete!!

57:50.614 --> 57:51.906
MagnaAngemon!

57:52.073 --> 57:55.035
Aww, how boring.

57:55.201 --> 57:58.413
Isn't there anyone worth fighting?

57:58.830 --> 58:00.415
Stop it!

58:59.391 --> 59:00.642
Meiko-san...

59:08.817 --> 59:09.817
Senpai...

59:09.943 --> 59:11.069
Don't worry.

59:20.203 --> 59:21.246
I'm sorry.

59:28.461 --> 59:29.504
Hikari.

59:36.886 --> 59:38.138
Gatomon!

59:39.055 --> 59:40.515
I'm alright.

59:40.765 --> 59:42.142
Don't go!

59:42.600 --> 59:45.520
Meicoomon is the one suffering the most.

59:46.146 --> 59:47.772
Because she's very kind.

59:47.939 --> 59:50.525
She wants for us, her friends...

59:51.317 --> 59:52.777
...to save her.

59:53.486 --> 59:55.739
She wants this scary incident to end.

59:56.322 --> 59:58.533
Please, Hikari.

59:59.367 --> 01:00:02.871
All light is within Meicoomon...

01:00:19.387 --> 01:00:23.224
"All light is within Meicoomon."

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.726
What do you mean?

01:00:24.893 --> 01:00:28.104
Gatomon just told me that.

01:00:28.396 --> 01:00:30.482
She was in a place I didn't know.

01:00:31.316 --> 01:00:33.526
A place where there's lots of data.

01:00:37.363 --> 01:00:38.490
That's true.

01:00:38.656 --> 01:00:41.743
Hikari-san does have a mysterious power.

01:00:42.285 --> 01:00:44.496
This sounds like another prophecy...

01:00:45.038 --> 01:00:47.040
All light...

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:50.084
Could it be?

01:00:53.963 --> 01:00:56.508
The reboot of the Real
World has started!

01:00:58.676 --> 01:00:59.928
We got to hurry!

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:17.278
Go!!

01:01:43.721 --> 01:01:45.056
Ikkakumon!

01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:30.411
Oh no, at this rate...

01:03:30.578 --> 01:03:32.914
They can't even evolve to ultimate form.

01:04:49.157 --> 01:04:51.492
Stop!!

01:04:51.659 --> 01:04:54.537
Please don't involve the Digimons!

01:04:57.123 --> 01:04:59.000
This is just too much...

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:00.835
Why?

01:05:01.169 --> 01:05:04.213
Why do they have to go through this?

01:05:07.967 --> 01:05:09.510
All this...

01:05:10.136 --> 01:05:11.971
...is unacceptable.

01:05:13.056 --> 01:05:15.933
Homeostasis has started the reboot.

01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:20.730
All your sufferings shall end in
just a few more momen...

01:05:20.897 --> 01:05:22.023
Shut up!

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.776
Don't be saying crap all on your terms!

01:05:25.568 --> 01:05:27.779
Who cares about
Homeostasis or Yggdrasil!

01:05:28.237 --> 01:05:29.489
We'll...

01:05:30.239 --> 01:05:32.784
We'll save the world in our own way!

01:05:37.705 --> 01:05:40.041
"Koushiro"

01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:56.224
Meiko-san, may I borrow your Digivice?

01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:57.558
Oh, yes.

01:05:58.559 --> 01:06:00.561
It's just as I thought.

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:03.564
"All light is within Meicoomon."

01:06:07.318 --> 01:06:08.986
What does that mean?

01:06:10.363 --> 01:06:12.323
After the Digital World's reboot,

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:15.576
I was wondering why only
Meicoomon had her memory.

01:06:16.202 --> 01:06:20.039
I thought maybe the backup data
was saved somewhere.

01:06:21.124 --> 01:06:23.084
Right before the last reboot,

01:06:23.626 --> 01:06:26.963
I was trying to take backup data of
Tentomon and everyone.

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:30.299
I don't know if the confusion
during battle caused this,

01:06:30.466 --> 01:06:33.010
but a part of Meicoomon's data
was mixed in.

01:06:33.177 --> 01:06:37.890
After analyzing it, I found that
the other Digimons' data was saved too.

01:06:41.686 --> 01:06:45.106
By utilizing all the networks
we have available right now,

01:06:45.273 --> 01:06:49.110
I've reconfirmed Meicoomon's data
through Meiko-san's Digivice.

01:06:51.654 --> 01:06:52.905
Please look.

01:06:53.072 --> 01:06:58.244
All Digimons' massive memory data
is saved inside of Meicoomon!

01:06:58.786 --> 01:06:59.870
What?

01:06:59.871 --> 01:07:01.831
When you say all...

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:05.376
You mean Patamon and everybody's
memory is still left?!

01:07:06.294 --> 01:07:07.879
The data before the reboot too?

01:07:08.296 --> 01:07:09.296
Yes.

01:07:10.715 --> 01:07:14.385
I like Mei-chan a lot!

01:07:15.928 --> 01:07:17.054
Agumon...

01:07:18.181 --> 01:07:22.226
Because all of the Digimon's data
was encased within Meicoomon,

01:07:22.393 --> 01:07:24.854
that was why she had
such tremendous powers.

01:07:25.021 --> 01:07:26.021
My goodness!

01:07:26.439 --> 01:07:30.234
Also, I've noticed something
looking at this data.

01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:32.904
There's special data locked away here.

01:07:33.487 --> 01:07:35.239
This is only a theory,

01:07:35.406 --> 01:07:38.910
but fear was what triggered
Meicoomon to go out of control.

01:07:39.452 --> 01:07:41.621
Normally, Meicoomon should have...

01:07:41.787 --> 01:07:45.291
..."kindness, honesty,
and memories with Meiko-san."

01:07:45.458 --> 01:07:48.211
By sealing away these warm memories,

01:07:48.377 --> 01:07:50.922
she may have increased
the dark side of her.

01:07:51.505 --> 01:07:55.509
Which means if we could open
this locked memory data,

01:07:55.676 --> 01:08:00.681
we may be able to return
Meicoomon back to her stable state.

01:08:01.098 --> 01:08:04.936
If she stabilizes,
Ordinemon might stop rampaging too!

01:08:05.102 --> 01:08:09.941
It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.
There's no other choice anyway.

01:08:10.107 --> 01:08:12.068
But what should we do?

01:08:12.235 --> 01:08:14.946
You said there's a lock
on the memory data...

01:08:15.988 --> 01:08:17.948
We need a password.

01:08:18.532 --> 01:08:20.326
Can you think of anything?

01:08:20.701 --> 01:08:22.703
A word Meicoomon would choose.

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:24.537
Mei-chan would choose?

01:08:45.935 --> 01:08:49.729
It's some type of keyword.
A special one that she'd remember.

01:08:49.897 --> 01:08:50.982
Umm...

01:08:51.148 --> 01:08:52.984
What about her name, Meiko?

01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:55.236
"Please enter password to access file."

01:08:55.403 --> 01:08:56.486
"Incorrect."

01:08:56.487 --> 01:08:57.988
"Meiko Mochizuki."

01:08:58.281 --> 01:08:59.282
"Mei-chan."

01:08:59.782 --> 01:09:00.782
"Mei."

01:09:01.367 --> 01:09:04.370
I've tried everything,
but they're all wrong.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.500
Is there anything else?!

01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:14.130
Meiko-chan, please think back.

01:09:14.296 --> 01:09:19.010
Try to remember a word you said a lot
or your first words together.

01:09:47.287 --> 01:09:48.287
"Access granted."

01:10:06.182 --> 01:10:07.308
What did you put?

01:10:07.475 --> 01:10:11.145
The first words
I taught Mei-chan the meaning of.

01:10:11.312 --> 01:10:15.816
For being together
and becoming my partner...

01:10:15.983 --> 01:10:19.320
"Password: TA MUCH"

01:10:19.862 --> 01:10:23.366
Mei-chan, these kind people
all helped to save you.

01:10:23.657 --> 01:10:25.242
How good you are safe.

01:10:26.994 --> 01:10:27.994
Ta much.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.330
Ta much.

01:10:30.456 --> 01:10:31.456
What?

01:10:33.626 --> 01:10:36.545
It's dialect for thank you.

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:47.556
All memory data is starting
to be restored!

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:43.654
I remember now, Taichi.

01:11:44.613 --> 01:11:47.950
We met each other once again.

01:11:48.576 --> 01:11:49.827
That's right.

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:52.663
But...

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:56.167
I had to say goodbye to Yamato.

01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:59.545
It was really tough...

01:12:00.337 --> 01:12:06.177
I was really happy
just to be by Joe's side.

01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:11.682
Even when I was infected,

01:12:12.308 --> 01:12:15.394
Takeru, you were kind as always.

01:12:16.437 --> 01:12:19.982
You were worried about
me the whole time.

01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:21.942
I see.

01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:24.695
I had forgotten about Sora.

01:12:25.654 --> 01:12:27.448
I'm sorry, Sora.

01:12:27.948 --> 01:12:29.950
You must have felt so lonely.

01:12:32.578 --> 01:12:35.206
That's right,
me and Koushiro-san are here now...

01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:41.212
...because we overcame those
really tough times together.

01:12:42.213 --> 01:12:44.215
I remember now, Mimi.

01:12:44.757 --> 01:12:47.593
All of these precious memories.

01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:52.014
And the fact that we were
the perfect partners.

01:13:17.373 --> 01:13:18.541
Hikari!

01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:21.502
Wait for me, I'll be there too!

01:13:22.378 --> 01:13:24.547
I'll get out right awa...

01:13:28.259 --> 01:13:29.510
Hikari!

01:13:30.302 --> 01:13:31.470
Gatomon?!

01:13:38.936 --> 01:13:40.020
What on earth...

01:13:40.604 --> 01:13:41.855
...is happening?

01:14:25.107 --> 01:14:30.654
Did the memory of their bonds
with humans awaken a new power?

01:14:41.206 --> 01:14:42.499
What's going on?

01:14:42.666 --> 01:14:44.877
The memories are returning...?

01:14:45.044 --> 01:14:48.922
Are the memories before the reboot
returning to the Digimons?

01:14:51.967 --> 01:14:55.262
There's clearly a difference in
Ordinemon as well.

01:14:59.391 --> 01:15:03.354
All the sealed away memories
are being restored one by one.

01:15:04.355 --> 01:15:05.689
To Ordinemon...

01:15:06.690 --> 01:15:09.610
No, to Meicoomon and Gatomon too.

01:15:12.279 --> 01:15:15.616
So this is the power
of the DigiDestined.

01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:17.993
It is truly a miracle.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.120
Please stop the reboot.

01:15:20.746 --> 01:15:24.875
If we can have a little more time
until all memory data is restored,

01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:27.586
we won't need a reboot!

01:15:52.986 --> 01:15:54.029
Hikari!

01:15:54.279 --> 01:15:55.406
Gatomon?!

01:15:58.575 --> 01:15:59.785
Could it be?!

01:15:59.952 --> 01:16:04.164
Ordinemon is trying to take back
stability and harmony!

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.226
Please...

01:16:44.079 --> 01:16:45.079
No!

01:16:45.622 --> 01:16:46.874
Don't go!

01:17:27.414 --> 01:17:28.749
Gatomon!

01:17:33.754 --> 01:17:35.005
Gatomon.

01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:36.465
Gatomon!

01:17:50.437 --> 01:17:51.814
I'm so glad...

01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:53.565
Hikari...

01:17:54.107 --> 01:17:55.567
Thank you...

01:18:02.699 --> 01:18:04.827
We were able to avoid the reboot.

01:18:04.993 --> 01:18:05.994
That's amazing!

01:18:06.161 --> 01:18:07.830
I'm so glad, truly.

01:18:07.996 --> 01:18:09.748
It's all thanks to Hackmon.

01:18:09.915 --> 01:18:10.915
No.

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:12.960
It's not over yet...

01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:16.547
No...

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:20.133
That's not the Mei-chan I know yet.

01:18:20.717 --> 01:18:22.886
Why is she still in that form?!

01:18:24.429 --> 01:18:26.139
It's not an evolution.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:35.691
What is this?

01:18:44.992 --> 01:18:46.243
Is she absorbing them?

01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:49.079
The emptied space in the data
is being used...

01:18:49.496 --> 01:18:50.914
...by Yggdrasil!

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.588
It's about to be complete.
Yggdrasil's paradise!

01:19:10.767 --> 01:19:13.103
What did Mei-chan do to you?!

01:19:16.523 --> 01:19:18.358
Don't make her suffer anymore!

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.918
Stop!!

01:19:37.169 --> 01:19:38.170
You idiot!

01:20:23.048 --> 01:20:24.549
Taichi!

01:20:25.175 --> 01:20:27.678
Welcome back, Taichi!

01:20:29.304 --> 01:20:30.013
Taichi...

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.180
Taichi-san!

01:20:56.748 --> 01:20:57.833
You're late!

01:21:01.670 --> 01:21:02.838
Let's end this...

01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:04.589
...with our own hands!

01:21:10.512 --> 01:21:11.596
Let's go!

01:21:26.361 --> 01:21:29.948
Agumon evolution!

01:21:47.674 --> 01:21:49.009
Greymon!

01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:04.357
Greymon super evolution!

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:17.621
MetalGreymon!

01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:23.168
MetalGreymon ultimate evolution!

01:22:36.056 --> 01:22:39.226
WarGreymon!

01:23:05.752 --> 01:23:07.504
Stop, Taichi!

01:23:07.879 --> 01:23:09.005
Please!

01:23:09.172 --> 01:23:10.757
Hikari-chan...

01:23:11.341 --> 01:23:12.801
Don't kill her!

01:23:13.677 --> 01:23:16.263
Anyone's heart has a light
and dark side to it.

01:23:20.267 --> 01:23:21.268
But,

01:23:21.434 --> 01:23:23.770
I want to believe in the light side!

01:23:24.271 --> 01:23:28.275
Find a way to save Meicoomon, please!

01:23:34.531 --> 01:23:36.241
You stay that way.

01:23:36.408 --> 01:23:37.408
What?

01:23:38.994 --> 01:23:40.537
You can hate me if you want.

01:23:52.465 --> 01:23:56.052
We're not the "chosen children" anymore.
We need to choose.

01:23:56.970 --> 01:23:58.555
No matter how tough it is.

01:23:59.139 --> 01:24:00.849
We must choose our future.

01:24:04.352 --> 01:24:05.478
I...

01:24:06.479 --> 01:24:10.275
...will probably
never forgive you, Taichi.

01:24:13.778 --> 01:24:15.572
But that's why...

01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:18.074
...I'll fight with you!

01:24:20.368 --> 01:24:22.829
Hikari, we shall together.

01:24:32.839 --> 01:24:35.550
Gatomon super evolution!

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.231
Angewomon!

01:24:51.441 --> 01:24:54.152
Angewomon ultimate evolution!

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:12.128
Magnadramon!

01:25:40.198 --> 01:25:41.783
Fire Tornado!

01:28:38.918 --> 01:28:39.918
Mei.

01:28:45.216 --> 01:28:46.509
Mei.

01:28:47.051 --> 01:28:48.344
Mei-chan.

01:28:56.102 --> 01:28:57.479
Ta much.

01:30:02.627 --> 01:30:04.170
Ta much...

01:30:26.568 --> 01:30:29.529
There's a child hiding
inside of everyone.

01:30:29.696 --> 01:30:32.448
This child is one who wants to play.

01:30:38.871 --> 01:30:40.957
So next's Daemon.

01:30:41.416 --> 01:30:43.251
Or maybe Diaboromon.

01:31:03.605 --> 01:31:05.690
I'm hungry"-

01:31:20.872 --> 01:31:25.752
Meiko-san, it's already been three months
since you've moved back to Tottori.

01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:31.799
The town that was destroyed that day
has slowly begun its reconstruction.

01:31:33.176 --> 01:31:35.928
Daisuke-kun's group who'd been
hospitalized got better too.

01:31:36.095 --> 01:31:40.975
In the Digital World, Homeostasis
forced a shutdown on Yggdrasil.

01:31:42.393 --> 01:31:45.021
All the Digimons returned
to the Digital World.

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:50.026
Society's outlook on Digimons
is still very critical right now.

01:31:50.193 --> 01:31:53.029
But with Koushiro-san's
research of the distortion,

01:31:53.196 --> 01:31:58.368
he's started to invent a gate to easily
access the two worlds without the D-3.

01:32:01.454 --> 01:32:03.331
"Someday together,

01:32:03.498 --> 01:32:07.293
I hope we can visit the
Digital World again.

01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:10.797
Please be well until then."

01:32:12.465 --> 01:32:15.051
"Message has been sent."

01:32:15.593 --> 01:32:17.053
Taichi's doing prep school?

01:32:17.428 --> 01:32:18.428
Yep.

01:32:18.846 --> 01:32:22.058
Hikari-chan told me.
He changed his career path.

01:32:22.225 --> 01:32:23.225
Really.

01:32:23.351 --> 01:32:27.188
Seems like he can't forget
what Mr. Nishijima said.

01:32:28.106 --> 01:32:30.942
He said, "You guys go build the future."

01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:33.069
What a huge homework assignment.

01:32:36.989 --> 01:32:39.742
Build the future, huh?

01:32:42.578 --> 01:32:46.082
Then maybe I'll aim for space...

01:32:46.499 --> 01:32:48.710
Sora-san, did you cut your hair?

01:32:48.876 --> 01:32:50.294
What? Oh, yeah.

01:32:50.461 --> 01:32:52.088
Oh, you did?

01:32:52.255 --> 01:32:54.590
That's why you're no good...

01:32:55.508 --> 01:32:57.093
Hey!

01:33:12.442 --> 01:33:13.609
Hello?

01:33:13.776 --> 01:33:14.776
Uh...

01:33:15.361 --> 01:33:16.612
Yagami-kun?

01:33:17.113 --> 01:33:18.113
Yeah.

01:33:22.243 --> 01:33:23.619
Long time no talk.

01:33:23.786 --> 01:33:24.786
Yeah.

01:33:25.246 --> 01:33:26.789
How are you?

01:33:27.582 --> 01:33:30.126
Did you get the package?

01:33:30.793 --> 01:33:32.128
Oh, yes.

01:33:32.295 --> 01:33:34.088
It came today.

01:33:34.505 --> 01:33:38.134
I was really happy to receive
everyone's Christmas presents.

01:33:39.177 --> 01:33:40.386
Ta much.

01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:42.764
Um, hey...

01:33:56.527 --> 01:33:58.821
I know a lot happened...

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.910
But no matter what...

01:34:10.792 --> 01:34:11.793
Um...

01:34:12.919 --> 01:34:15.963
We'll all be friends forever!

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:23.179
<i>Living in the world of nothing

01:34:23.346 --> 01:34:28.309

01:34:28.476 --> 01:34:32.104
<i>My wings are holding back</i>

01:34:32.271 --> 01:34:36.692
<i>They are still weak
but I'm sure I can fly</i>

01:34:36.859 --> 01:34:39.237

01:35:12.645 --> 01:35:16.774
<i>And I will go to see you
right away</i>

01:35:18.568 --> 01:35:23.656
<i>Better you forget
about unnecessary things</i>

01:35:23.823 --> 01:35:27.827
<i>There's no time
to joke anymore</i>

01:35:29.328 --> 01:35:34.917
<i>I wonder
what will reach the sky</i>

01:35:35.084 --> 01:35:42.925

what will resonate in this town</i>

01:36:39.273 --> 01:36:47.198
