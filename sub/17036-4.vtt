WEBVTT

00:05.300 --> 00:08.200
I can't believe
you've thrown it away.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.133
What about the
precious memories, Mom.

00:10.233 --> 00:11.700
Meg, I'm packing.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.100
I haven't really
got time for this.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.133
What do you even want your
old school uniform for?

00:16.233 --> 00:17.400
School reunion.

00:17.500 --> 00:21.100
I was going to wear it
as a gag, obviously.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.667
An ice breaker.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.167
Gags are what I was known for.

00:24.267 --> 00:26.100
That and pissing myself.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.167
Then I did you a favor, love.

00:28.267 --> 00:31.033
Nothing more attractive
than a fully grown woman

00:31.133 --> 00:32.167
in a school uniform.

00:32.267 --> 00:34.900
Think Google
would beg to differ.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.233
So when are you
coming back exactly?

00:37.333 --> 00:38.033
Well--

00:38.133 --> 00:39.733
FRANK Where's the lube, Jen?

00:42.800 --> 00:44.600
Meg is here, Frank.

00:48.467 --> 00:49.667
Hi, Meg.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.567
The lube, you probably
heard me shout.

00:55.667 --> 01:00.333
That's lubricant for the
bikes for the weekend.

01:00.433 --> 01:01.400
What bikes?

01:01.500 --> 01:04.067
Mountain bikes.

01:04.167 --> 01:07.233
You don't have mountain bikes.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.333
No.

01:08.433 --> 01:11.500
No, we don't, but we're
going to hire some.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.567
BMX style we thought
would be best for us,

01:14.667 --> 01:16.833
and we thought we're
going to need a really

01:16.933 --> 01:19.167
reliable source of lubrication.

01:19.267 --> 01:20.633
So better safe than sorry.

01:20.733 --> 01:27.067
You never really can be too
careful, lubrication wise.

01:27.167 --> 01:29.067
Sorry I appear
to have wandered

01:29.167 --> 01:30.033
into a Freudian nightmare.

01:30.133 --> 01:33.000
[theme music]

01:48.200 --> 01:49.433
You all right?

01:49.533 --> 01:51.433
I am more than
all right, fella.

01:51.533 --> 01:54.600
Old Meggington here has
pulled an absolute blinder

01:54.700 --> 01:57.567
and made us all some
cold, hard cashish money.

01:57.667 --> 01:58.767
Oh.

01:58.867 --> 02:00.767
You finally give that guy
in the Kinko's a handy.

02:00.867 --> 02:02.033
Nope.

02:02.133 --> 02:04.900
I have subleted our
flat for the weekend.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.267
You're welcome.
- Nice one, Meg.

02:07.367 --> 02:08.000
Cool.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.900
Wait, is that cool?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.100
Where are we going to live?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.967
Mom and Dad are away.

02:13.067 --> 02:13.900
Free house.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.267
Boom.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.700
We are looking at a
weekend of peep-free baths,

02:17.800 --> 02:21.433
Baby Bell in the fridge,
and "Clueless" on VHS.

02:21.533 --> 02:24.033
We're going to turn up the
school reunion brunch looking

02:24.133 --> 02:25.900
so bloody rested,
they're going to think

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
we're actually school girls.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.567
Yes.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.933
Look, nobody bloody cares much
about the stupid school reunion

02:31.033 --> 02:31.867
brunch.

02:31.967 --> 02:33.200
It's going to be shit.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.733
Everyone knows that
brunch is the worst meal.

02:34.833 --> 02:36.600
It's got booze, but
you're not allowed to get

02:36.700 --> 02:39.133
mega lush because it's morning.

02:39.233 --> 02:40.767
I like brunch.

02:40.867 --> 02:41.667
Of course, you do.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.000
You're posh.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.533
Laura, this is our
Romeo and Michelle moment.

02:44.633 --> 02:47.367
Time to show all these
bastards we've made it.

02:47.467 --> 02:50.600
Show them we're the top of the
tree, the cream of the crop.

02:50.700 --> 02:51.500
How?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.633
By lying, mate.

02:53.733 --> 02:54.967
And looking shit hot.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.200
Foolproof.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.367
I don't care about
any of those pricks.

02:57.467 --> 02:58.933
They don't even
live here anymore.

02:59.033 --> 03:00.200
They've all moved to London.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.233
Traders.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.533
What's so special
about London anyway?

03:03.633 --> 03:04.900
London is for mocks.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.767
It's expensive and shit.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.667
Will Johnson doesn't
live in London.

03:08.767 --> 03:09.833
He lives in Buenos Aires.

03:09.933 --> 03:11.033
Oh, here we go.

03:11.133 --> 03:12.433
He's a photographer now.

03:12.533 --> 03:15.133
He's got like so
many wish bracelets.

03:15.233 --> 03:17.167
I'm going to get him to
take my new head shots

03:17.267 --> 03:18.200
and fall in love with me.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.867
How are you going to do that?

03:20.967 --> 03:21.833
Yep, that will do it.

03:21.933 --> 03:23.933
We've got unfinished business.

03:24.033 --> 03:26.833
He was the first
boy to, you know,

03:26.933 --> 03:27.867
stick his fingers in the till.

03:27.967 --> 03:28.767
OK.

03:28.867 --> 03:29.700
Packing time.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.400
There's a bit of a
whiff from the fridge,

03:36.500 --> 03:38.233
but it's nothing to worry about.

03:38.333 --> 03:42.833
And that's a kettle for
your tea and what have you.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.400
Them's your curtains.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
That is a thong.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.500
I'll move that.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.567
I don't like it, Mommy.

03:47.667 --> 03:48.833
It smells.

03:48.933 --> 03:51.300
We have to be here, pumpkin,
because your sister is

03:51.400 --> 03:54.100
graduating, and someone
forgot to book the Novotel

03:54.200 --> 03:56.167
in January when I told him to.

03:56.267 --> 03:58.067
So this is the only place left.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.267
I mean, it just look like
a completely different

04:00.367 --> 04:01.500
flat from the photographs.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.033
Does it?

04:03.133 --> 04:05.067
That's weird.

04:05.167 --> 04:07.000
Well, enjoy.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.633
Oh, the toilet is a
little bit temperamental,

04:09.733 --> 04:14.033
so there's a coat hanger
in there for solids.

04:14.133 --> 04:16.467
Me casa su casa.

04:16.567 --> 04:17.867
Laters.

04:17.967 --> 04:18.767
Suckers.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.467
Dah, come on.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.000
It's weird.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.033
They key won't go in.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.133
I'll call Dad.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.133
All right, Meg.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.933
MEG: Hi, Dad.

04:40.033 --> 04:42.600
Hope you're having
a nice holiday.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.600
All it is--

04:43.700 --> 04:44.833
Yeah, your key doesn't work.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.067
Maybe.

04:46.167 --> 04:47.867
Yeah, we changed the locks.

04:47.967 --> 04:48.967
What?
Why?

04:49.067 --> 04:50.333
Well, to be
honest, mate, you do

04:50.433 --> 04:52.433
have a tendency to take
advantage when we're away,

04:52.533 --> 04:53.367
don't you?

04:53.467 --> 04:54.467
Go, Frank.

04:54.567 --> 04:57.067
I do not.

04:57.167 --> 05:00.633
Maybe this time, but I can't
believe you've done this.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.467
I'm going to have to sleep
on the street all day.

05:02.567 --> 05:03.600
I could get attacked.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.000
FRANK You're not going
to get attacked, Meg.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.167
You can't just turn
our house into a B&B.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.733
What's that matter
with your old flat?

05:09.833 --> 05:14.333
I've turned it
into a B&B. God.

05:14.433 --> 05:16.000
Am I too old to call Childline?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.500
It's actually really abusive.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.433
Come on.

05:18.533 --> 05:19.433
Step aside.

05:19.533 --> 05:22.433
Laura to the rescue.

05:22.533 --> 05:24.967
Give me a bank card.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.067
I'll show you.

05:28.833 --> 05:30.900
Shit.
OK.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.200
That didn't have any
money on it, did it?

05:32.300 --> 05:35.233
Yes, all of our
money from the Airbnb,

05:35.333 --> 05:36.967
and thus, all of our money.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.367
Shit-a-roma.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.067
Believe me, we would be
delighted to leave if there

05:45.167 --> 05:46.667
was anywhere else to go.

05:46.767 --> 05:47.767
You've already taken our money.

05:47.867 --> 05:48.967
No.
No.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.100
No.
No.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.033
Look, we're not
asking you to leave.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.567
And we thought we'd all
just stay here together.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.900
What are you going to do, curl
up at the bottom of the bed?

05:56.000 --> 05:56.800
If you'd like.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.933
Look, we'll just
stay on the sofa.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.500
You won't even know we're here.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.767
You are already teetering on
the brink of a one-star rating,

06:05.867 --> 06:06.967
young lady.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.400
Why don't you stop
bothering us and go

06:08.500 --> 06:09.767
find some friend to stay with.

06:12.533 --> 06:14.000
How do you turn
on the television?

06:14.100 --> 06:16.733
Green button and AV-1.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.167
OK.

06:19.267 --> 06:22.000
So who are our other friends?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.833
Scott, fancy seeing you here.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.800
At my own front door.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.167
You joker.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.967
I'll cut to the chase, man.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.267
I know you're busy.

06:34.367 --> 06:37.500
I wondered, will you
keep me company tonight?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.967
I'm so young.

06:39.067 --> 06:39.900
Bunny.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
She's gone rogue, Scott.

06:41.100 --> 06:41.933
Sorry.

06:42.033 --> 06:42.900
You can't do sexy baby.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.100
You're supposed to be a teen.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.900
You see, I've got a
client here who's just made

06:47.000 --> 06:48.400
a very important breakthrough.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.600
What do you want?

06:49.700 --> 06:52.733
So we were just trying
to make some cashish money

06:52.833 --> 06:54.467
by subletting the old flat.

06:54.567 --> 06:57.600
And let me guess, you
got nowhere to stay.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.300
Just a bit.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.633
A teensy touch on the
homeless side, yes.

07:02.733 --> 07:06.533
We were just taking advantage
trying to make a quick buck.

07:06.633 --> 07:09.400
You know how it is, Scott.
You're a psychologist.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.600
Right.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.467
Firstly, I'm a psychotherapist.

07:12.567 --> 07:13.567
Potato.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.667
Potato.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.100
Secondly, I only have
one bedroom, as you

07:17.200 --> 07:18.100
and Bunny well know.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.533
From the sex.

07:19.633 --> 07:23.200
And thirdly, every time
I spend any time with you,

07:23.300 --> 07:25.333
I end up having to
spend even more time

07:25.433 --> 07:27.367
with my own psychotherapist,
Dr. Francis.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.433
Maybe he's got
somewhere we can sleep.

07:33.067 --> 07:33.967
Right.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.267
Oh.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.033
Looks like it's an alley
raping for us tonight.

07:37.133 --> 07:39.367
Suppose outside, shall I?

07:48.933 --> 07:50.667
What are you doing,
Gary, share cocking?

07:50.767 --> 07:52.667
Put some pants on, mate.

07:52.767 --> 07:53.667
You've got company.

07:53.767 --> 07:57.667
Now is not a good time.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.100
You got someone in there?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.833
Have you got some slag in there?

08:00.933 --> 08:02.067
Get out the way.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.267
Let me fucking see her.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.400
I'm not having this, Gary.

08:07.833 --> 08:11.233
What the hell?

08:11.333 --> 08:12.833
This is how we die.

08:12.933 --> 08:15.267
Holt. It is the
evil temptress,

08:15.367 --> 08:17.467
the whore of Theron, Laura.

08:17.567 --> 08:20.433
How does this crushed velvet
slag know my name, Gary?

08:20.533 --> 08:21.367
What's going on?

08:21.467 --> 08:22.533
It's my guild.

08:22.633 --> 08:23.800
We've decided to [inaudible]
at IRL for a bit.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.600
- What?
- Me guild.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.833
They've been helping me
through a tough time.

08:27.933 --> 08:29.300
What kind of tough time?

08:29.400 --> 08:30.467
Did your mom finally die?

08:30.567 --> 08:31.800
Did you get that
Princess Diana plate?

08:31.900 --> 08:33.000
Can I have it?
- No, Laura.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.767
A difficult breakup.

08:34.867 --> 08:38.033
Well, You're not going
get over it mincing around

08:38.133 --> 08:39.633
with these goblins, are you?

08:39.733 --> 08:40.900
Tell them to bugger off.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.100
We need somewhere to sleep.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.267
No.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.000
What?

08:47.100 --> 08:49.433
No, Laura.

08:49.533 --> 08:54.667
You can stay, but if you
do, you have to participate.

08:54.767 --> 08:55.900
All of you.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.067
Jesus Christ.

08:57.167 --> 09:01.433
Let's just get this
over with then.

09:01.533 --> 09:05.067
You may proceed
to cross the bridge.

09:05.167 --> 09:06.300
What do you mean the bridge.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.500
I though we were in the castle?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.533
God, keep up, Meg.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.900
The bridge troll has
just granted us our wish.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.933
Which one's the bridge troll?

09:13.033 --> 09:14.567
You called, my lady?

09:14.667 --> 09:17.733
Well, I wish to go to
the Magic Kingdom, a.k.a.

09:17.833 --> 09:18.667
bed.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.967
Nice try.

09:20.067 --> 09:22.067
But playing standard Gert rules.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.000
Not that you get that.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.867
Lightning ball, past 10.

09:25.967 --> 09:28.733
Amulet fears belt,
lightning bolt reversed.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.567
You've killed her.

09:40.033 --> 09:41.067
Oh.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.400
Well, I didn't mean
to kill her, did I?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.567
How did you know
how to do that?

09:53.833 --> 09:55.533
Are you a secret LARPer?

09:55.633 --> 09:56.433
No.

09:56.533 --> 09:57.733
Oh, my god.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.867
I just-- oh, fuck off, Meg.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.467
Tell it the
bridge troll, mate.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.833
No.

10:02.933 --> 10:04.133
Oh, come on, Laura.

10:04.233 --> 10:05.600
It's only a joke.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.133
Get out.

10:12.433 --> 10:13.733
OK, guys.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.533
You know I'm all for a jag, but
it's actually quite cold now,

10:15.633 --> 10:17.167
and I want to look good
for the union tomorrow.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.700
Yeah, well, what
do you suggest?

10:18.800 --> 10:20.100
We walked out of the flat.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.500
We've run out of friends
plus we've got 14 pounds

10:23.600 --> 10:24.900
35 between us.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.800
30, 35.

10:25.900 --> 10:26.733
[inaudible]

10:26.833 --> 10:27.900
When?

10:28.000 --> 10:32.233
Girls, let Mommy
take care of this.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.767
We're going to put on
tomorrow's glad rags,

10:33.867 --> 10:37.167
taunt ourselves up, go to
the hottest bar in town,

10:37.267 --> 10:39.700
find some totty, and then
we'll go home with them.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.400
So prostitute ourselves?

10:41.500 --> 10:42.933
No.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.833
We're not going to have
sex with them, silly.

10:44.933 --> 10:47.233
We'll pretend that we might just
till we get to someone's flat,

10:47.333 --> 10:48.300
and we'll crash there.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.667
Good plan.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.433
Sounds a bit risky.

10:51.533 --> 10:53.233
Exactly.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.600
If you got it, flaunt it.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.100
Not woman.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.400
No offense, Meg, but what
have your morals ever got you?

11:13.900 --> 11:15.600
Whoa.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.900
You two are fine.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
But this ain't happening.

11:20.100 --> 11:24.833
Well, I can take
my blazer off.

11:24.933 --> 11:25.800
Pub?

11:35.367 --> 11:36.633
Jesus.

11:36.733 --> 11:39.500
I mean, a lot of these people
do look like serial killers.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.700
And we're not leaving till
one of them takes us home.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.867
I think my outfit is going to
invite the wrong kind of man.

11:44.967 --> 11:48.367
Meg, your outfit is
inviting no kind of man.

11:48.467 --> 11:50.467
Let's face it, Laura,
this one's on us.

11:50.567 --> 11:51.333
Right.

11:51.433 --> 11:52.767
Let's get this party started.

12:24.900 --> 12:28.433
(SINGING) I don't
need anybody--

12:28.533 --> 12:31.333
Night time.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.133
Oh, bogs.

12:33.233 --> 12:34.867
Time to go, girls.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.667
[sighing]

12:55.533 --> 12:57.400
Good night, mate.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.633
What the hell is going on?

13:07.733 --> 13:08.633
I can see you.

13:13.067 --> 13:14.833
Which input is the DVD on?

13:14.933 --> 13:18.733
AB-2 select DVD from the menu.

13:18.833 --> 13:22.767
I mean, Doper Road is nice.

13:22.867 --> 13:25.233
It is nice, but do
you think there's

13:25.333 --> 13:27.367
like a park we could sleep in?

13:27.467 --> 13:28.900
God, you don't want
to sleep in a park, Meg.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.800
That's a number one rule, not
unless you want a pillow that's

13:31.900 --> 13:33.500
made of Johnny's and dog shit.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.367
We just need to
find somewhere posh,

13:35.467 --> 13:38.567
like a round-about flower bed.

13:38.667 --> 13:39.467
Or--

13:48.167 --> 13:50.467
This will do.

13:50.567 --> 13:54.967
This is six hours beauty
sleep before brunch.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.233
[inaudible] a beefer.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.033
Oy!

14:04.133 --> 14:06.033
Oh, my god!

14:06.133 --> 14:07.033
What are you doing?

14:07.133 --> 14:09.600
[screaming]

14:12.700 --> 14:13.600
Ay!

14:13.700 --> 14:16.567
[screaming]

14:23.067 --> 14:24.567
Has he gone?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.033
Oh, it's too soft.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.467
This is like a beach.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.667
Let's just wait here a
minute until the coast clears.

14:49.733 --> 14:50.533
Ow!

15:00.533 --> 15:02.833
Excuse me!

15:02.933 --> 15:04.400
Cease fire!

15:04.500 --> 15:05.400
Cease fire!

15:09.467 --> 15:11.267
Good god.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.267
Is it bad?

15:19.100 --> 15:21.333
What the hell
is going on here?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.433
LAURA: Where are you taking us?

15:27.533 --> 15:29.433
GOLF PLAYER: I'm escorting
you off the premises.

15:29.533 --> 15:30.200
LAURA: Water.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.367
GOLF PLAYER: Hey!

15:31.467 --> 15:32.100
Hey!

15:32.200 --> 15:33.300
LAURA: I need water.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.267
GOLF PLAYER: Hey,
what are you doing?

15:35.367 --> 15:36.633
Get yourself back here.

15:36.733 --> 15:38.100
LAURA: No, I need a drink.
GOLF PLAYER: Come here.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.133
LAURA: I'm allowed it.
GOLF PLAYER: Come here.

15:39.233 --> 15:40.400
LAURA: You can't stop me.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.567
GOLF PLAYER: This is
why women should never

15:41.667 --> 15:42.700
be allowed on golf courses.

15:45.467 --> 15:47.633
MEG: I really don't think
this is a good idea.

15:47.733 --> 15:48.767
Oh, come.

15:48.867 --> 15:50.200
I am not missing
out on Will Johnson.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.733
I don't look brunch
appropriate, Bunny.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.033
BUNNY: You promised.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.333
What about showing
people the we've made it?

15:55.433 --> 15:56.967
Will won't be
doing that though.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.967
Someone might be able
to have us to stay.

15:59.067 --> 16:01.033
They might have a hotel room.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.367
Oh, come on.
Please.

16:02.467 --> 16:03.733
Please.
Please.

16:03.833 --> 16:04.967
I can seduce Will Johnson.

16:05.067 --> 16:07.300
He's got to have a
bed for us, hasn't he?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.200
I mean, we do need to find
somewhere to sleep tonight.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.800
These guys don't really care
what we look like, will they?

16:12.900 --> 16:13.733
Nah.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.067
They're all school mates.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.600
We go way back.

16:16.700 --> 16:20.300
They've seen us when we
looked worse than this.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.900
As I will be saying to
Will Johnson later tonight,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.967
it's what's inside that counts.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.167
Inside my vagina.

16:34.733 --> 16:37.000
Oh, god.

16:37.100 --> 16:41.867
You did want to make
an entrance, didn't you?

16:41.967 --> 16:44.767
OK, look, we just
need to find a bed,

16:44.867 --> 16:48.333
even if it means going home
with Mr. Pillsgate, caretaker.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.400
I think we're about
old for him now.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.467
There he is.

16:57.567 --> 16:58.633
How do I look?

16:58.733 --> 16:59.900
5 out of 10.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.267
My 5 is you're nice.

17:01.367 --> 17:02.233
That's OK.

17:02.333 --> 17:04.333
You don't smell
great though, mate.

17:04.433 --> 17:06.900
Have you got any
perfume on you?

17:07.000 --> 17:07.833
No.

17:07.933 --> 17:08.833
Right.

17:08.933 --> 17:10.400
Well, is anyone looking for it?

17:15.167 --> 17:17.633
My knickers are full of sand.

17:17.733 --> 17:21.467
What are you doing?

17:21.567 --> 17:23.900
It's my family perfume.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.333
It's pheromones.

17:25.433 --> 17:26.667
Drives men wild.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.767
It's science, Meg.

17:28.867 --> 17:30.500
Is it?

17:30.600 --> 17:33.367
Professor Stephen Hawking would
call that science, would he?

17:33.467 --> 17:34.267
No, a fact.

17:34.367 --> 17:35.333
I read it on the internet.

17:35.433 --> 17:36.567
Right.

17:36.667 --> 17:37.667
Wish me luck.

17:44.633 --> 17:47.500
I got a hefty bonus, which
Marvin could have been it.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.400
Oh, my god.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.300
Laura.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.467
Wow.

17:54.567 --> 17:55.400
You look--
- Yeah.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.133
I know.

17:56.233 --> 17:57.367
Time has been good to me.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.567
So any of you has
got a spare bedroom?

17:59.667 --> 18:00.467
What?

18:00.567 --> 18:02.067
Staff interest.

18:02.167 --> 18:05.433
Well, I mean, we all have
guest rooms, of course.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.300
Right.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.800
I need somewhere
to stay tonight.

18:07.900 --> 18:12.967
Oh, well, I suppose you
could stay with me in Camden.

18:13.067 --> 18:13.900
What?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.967
Camden in London.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.067
London.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.867
What a shithole.
How about you, then?

18:19.967 --> 18:21.467
- I live in London.
- You?

18:21.567 --> 18:22.233
Me too.

18:22.333 --> 18:23.767
Absolute time wasters.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.667
[laughter]

18:34.733 --> 18:35.700
Hi, guys.

18:38.267 --> 18:39.667
Jeremy, how are you?

18:39.767 --> 18:41.733
Fine.

18:41.833 --> 18:42.800
Sorry, who are you?

18:42.900 --> 18:44.533
Classic, Jeremy.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.433
Class clown.

18:46.533 --> 18:49.667
You know me.

18:49.767 --> 18:50.633
What?

18:50.733 --> 18:52.400
Seriously.
No one?

18:52.500 --> 18:53.400
It's me.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.967
Meg.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.533
We were in school
together for seven years.

18:58.633 --> 19:03.200
I went on holiday
with your family, Amy.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.333
Right.

19:04.433 --> 19:08.533
Well, that was a blow
for the old self esteem.

19:08.633 --> 19:11.267
No mind.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.767
What are you guys all up too?

19:12.867 --> 19:14.800
Well, I'm a human
rights lawyer.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.433
It was between that or modeling.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.067
And I'm a dentist.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.200
Alex here was just
telling us how

19:19.300 --> 19:20.333
he's built an orphanage in--

19:20.433 --> 19:21.133
Yes.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.333
Sorry, did you say dentist?

19:23.433 --> 19:25.900
Would you mind having
a look at my tooth?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.733
It just came loose.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.533
I got hit by a
golf ball earlier.

19:30.633 --> 19:33.533
So where are you
staying tonight, Jeremy?

19:33.633 --> 19:36.700
And I swear that lion
just knew me, you know?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.300
He just like got
me in a way that I

19:39.400 --> 19:41.333
guess a woman never could.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.567
What's that smell?

19:45.667 --> 19:46.933
Guilty.

19:47.033 --> 19:47.933
Ah.

19:48.033 --> 19:50.467
I knew you'd remember.

19:50.567 --> 19:51.833
Yeah.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.367
Right.

19:53.467 --> 19:57.000
Anyway, the thing you need to
remember about wild beasts--

19:57.100 --> 19:58.633
I feel sleepy.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.800
Yeah?

20:02.900 --> 20:04.633
Oh, sexy baby.

20:04.733 --> 20:08.267
There's no competing with that.

20:08.367 --> 20:13.167
So maybe we should go
somewhere a little bit quieter,

20:13.267 --> 20:15.733
like your hotel room, say?

20:15.833 --> 20:17.533
I don't have a hotel room.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.733
I'm getting a plane back
to Buenos Aires tonight.

20:20.833 --> 20:26.300
But I think I know somewhere
we can go to catch up.

20:31.867 --> 20:34.233
I'm so tired, Laura.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.200
I think I'm hallucinating.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.000
I just need sleep.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.933
There's only one thing for it.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.167
You're going home
with Mr. Pillsgate.

20:41.267 --> 20:42.933
I'm getting out
the begging bowl.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.367
Don't do it, Meg.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.433
Hey.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.167
Hey.

20:59.533 --> 21:01.600
Thank you.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.633
So you all remember me.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.567
I'm Meg.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.300
I'm Meg.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.600
I pissed my pants on the
school trip to Cheddar Gorge.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.000
(ALL) Oh.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.000
Right.
Yeah.

21:16.100 --> 21:19.700
All is it's a funny
story, really.

21:22.467 --> 21:26.300
I'm in a little bit of a pickle.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.067
And I need somewhere
