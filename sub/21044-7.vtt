-It's what my father would have wanted.
-No, it's not!

14:07.930 --> 14:09.181
It's not.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.271
Do you promise not to hate me?

14:16.481 --> 14:17.691
What is it?

14:20.025 --> 14:22.487
It was just supposed
to be small and in the pan,

14:22.570 --> 14:25.072
like last time when I used
the fire extinguisher.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.907
And you were supposed to come in

14:26.991 --> 14:28.951
and save the day, and save Seo-yeon,

14:29.034 --> 14:31.120
and you would have,
but you saved me instead!

14:31.203 --> 14:32.831
I mean, you saved my life!

14:33.247 --> 14:34.416
And you really shouldn't have!

14:34.499 --> 14:37.293
Like everyone would be better off
if I was dead.

14:39.044 --> 14:39.962
No.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.338
No, it's true.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.758
-No.
-Shhh!

14:43.842 --> 14:45.134
Shut up.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.429
It's true.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.181
You should do something.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.646
If you don't make it right for me,

14:58.022 --> 14:59.858
I'll tell everyone the truth.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.067
The truth?

15:02.861 --> 15:04.987
What, that I murdered Mr. Park?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.072
Who would believe you?

15:07.156 --> 15:09.033
And you had Joon shot with an arrow.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.620
Well, again, unintended consequences.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.790
The white girl was the target there.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.042
But it all turned out well enough.

15:18.501 --> 15:22.046
I get Park Joon, you get Seo-yeon.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.507
That was the deal!

15:25.215 --> 15:27.677
So make it right!

15:29.136 --> 15:30.555
What did you mean,

15:30.638 --> 15:32.557
it was supposed to be small

15:32.640 --> 15:33.850
like last time?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.603
Did you...

15:39.522 --> 15:41.398
You didn't start the fire?

15:43.860 --> 15:45.235
You...

15:45.319 --> 15:48.490
are the reason I lost my restaurant?

15:51.493 --> 15:53.035
The Libertine...

15:54.411 --> 15:56.330
It was everything.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.165
It was my heart!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.794
And you...

16:00.877 --> 16:02.545
I don't understand, Claire.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.964
Why would you do that to me?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.467
It was the only way, I mean,
you had to choose--

16:07.550 --> 16:09.176
But I chose you!

16:09.259 --> 16:11.303
I chose you!

16:11.763 --> 16:15.057
I took you in, I gave you a job,

16:15.224 --> 16:18.435
I got shot with an arrow for you!

16:18.686 --> 16:21.438
Damn it, I almost fell in love with you!

16:36.538 --> 16:38.372
I never want to see you again.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.458
You have to understand that I--

16:46.255 --> 16:48.048
He didn't catch me.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.260
[Ga-in] Do whatever it takes!

16:53.345 --> 16:56.558
And stick to the plan.
I'm tired of surprises.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.518
Are you?

17:00.227 --> 17:01.353
Yes.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.608
Then you're really gonna hate this!

17:05.692 --> 17:07.443
[shouts]

17:08.778 --> 17:10.237
Don't!

17:10.487 --> 17:13.282
You said this story needed me!

17:13.365 --> 17:15.075
-It's for the best.
-No.

17:15.827 --> 17:16.911
No.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.538
No!

17:20.748 --> 17:22.876
See you in the next series.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.504
[terrifying music]

17:36.931 --> 17:39.017
["Don't Wake Me Up" playing]
