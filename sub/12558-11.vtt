TO THE PRESIDENT

13:43.573 --> 13:47.658

STICKING ME IN A RUBBER ROOM.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.364

WHERE WAS HE
FOR SIX SOLID HOURS

13:52.123 --> 13:54.080
VVHEN NOBODY IN THE
VVORLD COULD FIND HIM?

13:54.167 --> 13:58.877
HOVV DID HE MAKE A REENTRY
VVITHOUT BURNING UP INTO A FLAKE?

13:58.963 --> 14:02.627

HAVE TO ASK HIM.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.551

15:12.870 --> 15:15.783
THAT FENCE WASN'T THERE

19:16.947 --> 19:20.281
I, UM...

19:20.368 --> 19:22.826
I DON'T KNOW WHAT

19:33.464 --> 19:35.375
SOMETHING MUST
HAVE HAPPENED, BOB.

19:35.466 --> 19:40.051
SOME DELUSIONS.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.253
SOME DISTORTIONS.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.840
LIKE THAT FENCE
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.596
I DON'T REMEMBER IT.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.348
AND YET YOU SAID
IT HAD BEEN THERE

19:49.438 --> 19:51.349
WHEN WE BOUGHT
THE HOUSE.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.523
AND THAT BUSINESS
WITH BILL CONNACHER.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.773
HE TOLD ME HE CALLED
YOU BEFORE THE FLIGHT.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.400
HE MADE IT
A POINT TO TELL ME.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.482
AND THEN, AFTERWARD...

20:02.576 --> 20:07.070
AFTERVVARD, HE SAID THERE'D BEEN
NO SUCH PHONE CONVERSATION.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.781
IT'S UNIMPORTANT.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.539
IT'S INSIGNIFICANT, REALLY.

20:13.629 --> 20:17.714
AND YET...

20:17.800 --> 20:20.462
AND YET IT ALL
SEEMS TO BE PART

20:20.553 --> 20:24.467
OF SOME SORT
OF CRAZY PATTERN.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.548
SOMETHING IS
VERY WRONG,

20:26.642 --> 20:29.259
BECAUSE HE DID
TELL ME HE CALLED.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.015
THAT FENCE VVASN'T THERE, AND
THOSE EAGLES HA\/E NEVER BEEN

20:32.106 --> 20:39.103

I LEFT HERE, I VVAS A MAJOR.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.689
YOU, UM--
YOU TOLD ME ONCE

20:42.783 --> 20:45.992
THAT THERE ARE WHOLE
AREAS OF SPACE MEDICINE

20:46.078 --> 20:48.866
THAT VVE KNOVV PRACTICALLY
NOTHING ABOUT.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.493
PHENOMENA AND
REACTION PATTERNS

20:51.584 --> 20:54.042
THAT CAN ONLY
BE GUESSED AT.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.586
I'M SURE THIS
IS ONE OF THEM.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.874
I'M SURE THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU BUT A...

21:00.968 --> 21:02.584
A COUPLE
OF FIXATIONS

21:02.636 --> 21:05.094
THAT ARE GONNA
GO AWAY WITH TIME.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.645
<i>NOW, LET'S GO DOWNSTNRS
AND HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE.</i>

21:13.731 --> 21:16.223

A WHITE FENCE

21:16.317 --> 21:18.558
AND A PROMOTION END
THE WORLD FOR YOU.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.644
IF THAT'S AS FAR AS IT
GOES, I'LL TRY NOT TO.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.321
BUT WHAT IF...

21:23.407 --> 21:25.114
WHAT IF
OTHER THINGS--?

22:48.576 --> 22:50.613

25:36.243 --> 25:40.237
I CAN'T...

25:40.330 --> 25:42.583
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
IT TO YOU. I--

25:42.666 --> 25:46.830
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.628
I HAVE CHANGED,
HAVEN'T I?

25:49.715 --> 25:52.833
THERE IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT ME.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.542
THE CHILD SENSED IT.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.719
YOU HAVE, TOO.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.765
YOU HAVE,
HAVEN'T YOU?

26:01.852 --> 26:03.013
YES, I HAVE.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.903
I JUST DON'T
KNOW. IT'S--

26:17.993 --> 26:21.657
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE...
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME SOMEHOW.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.828
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
CALL BILL CONNACHER.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.290
THAT WASN'T NECESSARY.

26:33.383 --> 26:39.049
TOMORROW I'LL TURN MYSELF
IN FOR PSYCHIATRIC HELP.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.631
I DON'T KNOVV VVHAT
IT IS THAT HAPPENED.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.261
SOMETHING DID.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.844
SOMETHING IS TEARING
US ALL APART.

26:45.938 --> 26:49.681
SOMETHING SO REMOTE, VVE CAN'T
E\/EN PUT IT INTO VVORDS.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.688
<i>SOMETHING... SOMETHING, UNTIL
WE FIND OUT WHAT IT IS,</i>

26:52.778 --> 26:54.485
<i>IT'S GONNA
WRECK US, HELEN.</i>

27:00.119 --> 27:02.201
IVAN, THERE WAS NOTHING
HE COULD TELL YOU

27:02.287 --> 27:04.278
THAT OCCURRED IN SPACE

27:04.373 --> 27:07.616
THAT COULD GIVE US SOME KEY
OR SOMETHING TO ALL THIS?

27:07.668 --> 27:11.662
NOTHING THAT HE
COULD RELATE TO ME.

27:11.755 --> 27:15.293
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT
HE REMAIN HERE, HOVVEVER.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.297
FOR THE TIME BEING, I'D LIKE
TO TREAT HIM AS AN OUTPATIENT.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.173
HAVE HIM COME IN
AT INTERVALS,

27:20.264 --> 27:22.255
BUT IN NO VVAY SUGGEST
TO HIM THAT HE'S

27:22.349 --> 27:25.637
IN AN ABERRANT CONDITION REQUIRING
PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.309
THIS IS ONE
OF THOSE INSTANCES

27:27.354 --> 27:29.311
WHERE THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF THE SITUATION

27:29.398 --> 27:31.184
REQUIRES VERY
CAREFUL HANDLING.

27:31.275 --> 27:34.734
WE'RE RIGHT BACK
WHERE WE STARTED, THEN.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.653
UH... MRS. GAINES, I DON'T
MEAN TO SOUND CALLOUS.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.731
HE'S AN EXCEPTIONAL GENTLEMAN,
THAT HUSBAND OF YOURS.

27:40.826 --> 27:43.033
I THINK HE'LL BE OUT OF
THE VVOODS IN NO TIME.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.033
MY CONCERN HAPPENS TC
BE, VERY SPECIFICALLY,

27:46.123 --> 27:48.034
A SPACE PROJECT,
NOT A MAN.

ABOUT THAT FENCE?

27:54.673 --> 27:57.665

WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.426

SURPRISED THAT IT VVAS THERE?

28:00.512 --> 28:04.847
THE MOMENT THAT HE CAME
HOME YESTERDAY MORNING.

28:04.933 --> 28:11.020
REALLY A VERY STRANGE
COLLECTION OF DELUSIONS.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.726
A WHITE PICKET FENCE...

28:13.817 --> 28:15.603

28:15.694 --> 28:17.685

28:17.779 --> 28:20.612

WAS HE DOUBTED VERY MUCH

28:20.699 --> 28:23.566

PIN ANY MEDALS ON HIM.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.492

29:51.164 --> 29:53.997
SUGGESTING NOTHING.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.997
SOMETHING OR EVERYTHING.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.124
WHAT CAN IT SUGGEST?

29:59.214 --> 30:04.709
SIMPLY THAT THERE'S
A MAN IN MY HOUSE WHO--

30:04.803 --> 30:06.714

30:06.805 --> 30:12.551
THE QUESTION IS, A MAN IN

30:12.644 --> 30:17.855

30:17.941 --> 30:20.148

30:22.946 --> 30:25.688

30:58.648 --> 31:00.389

31:00.484 --> 31:02.600

31:02.694 --> 31:05.436

31:10.911 --> 31:13.699
I'VE BEEN GOING OVER A SET
OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS UP THERE,

31:13.789 --> 31:15.530
AND JOTTING
DOWN SOME NOTES.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.207
I'VE UNCOVERED SOME
VERY REVEALING ITEMS.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.910
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY
BASIC HISTORICAL FACTS

31:21.004 --> 31:22.415
THAT SIMPLY DON'T JIBE.

31:22.506 --> 31:23.962
FOR EXAMPLE,

31:24.049 --> 31:25.881
IT TALKS ABOUT A MAN
NAMED ANDERSON,

31:25.967 --> 31:27.799
SENT BY THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT

31:27.886 --> 31:30.218
TO SUPERVISE THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE PANAMA CANAL.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.171
SO?

31:32.265 --> 31:34.051
<i>SO, I NEVER HEARD OF
ANYONE NAMED ANDERSON.</i>

31:34.142 --> 31:36.395
<i>IT HAPPENED TO BE A
MAN NAMED GOETHALS.</i>

31:36.478 --> 31:38.560
IT ALSO TALKS
ABOUT AN AMERICAN ACE

31:38.605 --> 31:40.141
NAMED
EDDIE RICKENBACKER

31:40.232 --> 31:42.314
FROM WORLD WAR I
WHO WAS LOST ON A RAFT

31:42.401 --> 31:44.733
IN THE NEXT WAR
AND NEVER FOUND.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.481
THAT'S RIGHT.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.063
HE, UH, CRASHED, AND
THAT VVAS THE END OF IT.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.198
BUT THAT WASN'T
THE END OF IT.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.740
THE RAFT WAS FOUND.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.572
RICKENBACKER WAS SAVED.

31:54.663 --> 31:58.497
HE BECAME THE PRESIDENT
OF AN AIRLINES COMPANY.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.961
I'VE GOT DOZENS
OF ITEMS LIKE THAT.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.126
<i>MEN TALKED ABOUT
WHO NEVER EXISTED.</i>

32:03.213 --> 32:05.705
<i>MEN WHO EXISTED
AND NOT EVEN MENTIONED.</i>

32:05.799 --> 32:08.917
HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT / KNOI/I/
HAPPENED A CERTAIN VVAY

32:09.010 --> 32:11.342
SOMEHOW, ACCORDING TO
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA,

32:11.430 --> 32:13.671
DIDN'T HAPPEN,
OR HAPPENED ANOTHER WAY.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.177
<i>THE THINGS I REMEMBER
ARE NOT DELUSIONS.</i>

32:16.268 --> 32:18.851
<i>THEY'RE THE LEGITIMATE
RECOLLECTIONS OF THINGS</i>

32:18.937 --> 32:20.098
<i>AS I REMEMBER THEM.</i>

32:20.188 --> 32:22.441
BUT SOMEHOW,
SOME WAY,

32:22.482 --> 32:25.315
THIS WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN FOR ME.

32:25.402 --> 32:28.269
WELL, NOT IN EVERY
WAY, YOU UNDERSTAND.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.279

32:40.375 --> 32:46.462

SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES

32:51.303 --> 32:54.671

ALONG THE LINE OF EVOLUTION.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.176
BOB, FOR THE
LOVE OF HEAVEN--

33:03.565 --> 33:06.182
DO YOU WANT TO FOLLOW
THAT LINE OF REASONING?

33:06.276 --> 33:08.313
BECAUSE, IF YOU DO,
THERE ARE A COUPLE

33:08.403 --> 33:11.395
OF BUILT-IN CONDITIONS
THAT GO ALONG WITH IT.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.401

33:20.373 --> 33:22.501

THAT THERE
ARE TWO EARTHS,

33:24.044 --> 33:27.662

33:30.550 --> 33:33.508
CROSSED OVER TO

35:02.267 --> 35:04.599
OH, THAT
WASN'T FAIR.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.762
YOU'VE TAKEN A LITTLE

35:07.856 --> 35:11.224
YOU'VE SUPERIMPOSED ON
HER YOUR OVVN DOUBTS.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.934
I'VE DONE NOTHING

35:12.986 --> 35:15.193

35:15.280 --> 35:19.023

35:19.117 --> 35:22.200
AND, HEAVEN HELP ME,

35:27.834 --> 35:31.202
WHAT YOU'VE JUST
TOLD ME IS FANTASTIC.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.788

35:33.840 --> 35:35.456
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.541
INCREDIBLE.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.220
I HELPED BUILD
THAT SPACECRAFT.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.799
I KNOW IT VERY WELL.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.258

35:46.353 --> 35:49.812

35:51.441 --> 35:52.977
DOWN TO THE VERY

35:53.068 --> 35:56.231
BUT IT'S SIMPLY NOT

35:56.321 --> 35:58.403
IT'S A DIFFERENT VEHICLE.

35:58.490 --> 36:02.404

OUT OF THE SAME MOLD,

YOU ADD THEM ALL UP

36:14.464 --> 36:17.331

VERY IRREVOCABLE FACT:

36:17.384 --> 36:21.673
COLONEL GAINES WENT UP
IN ONE SPACECRAFT,

36:21.763 --> 36:24.721
BUT HE'S OBVIOUSLY
COME BACK IN ANOTHER.

36:24.808 --> 36:28.176

WITH TWO ALTERNATIVES.

36:28.228 --> 36:31.186

ACTUALLY BLACKED OUT

36:31.231 --> 36:34.064
AND HAS NO KNOWLEDGE
OF WHAT OCCURRED.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.892
OR TWO:

36:36.986 --> 36:39.114
COLONEL GAINES IS NOT
WHO WE THINK HE IS.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.919

<i>[loud rumbling]</i>

39:53.600 --> 39:56.513
RETROS ARE FIRING.

39:56.603 --> 40:01.018
I'M STARTING MY
REENTRY NOW.

40:01.107 --> 40:04.441
I'M GOING TO
FLY BY WIRE.

40:04.527 --> 40:10.239
I'M DOWN TO
15% ON MANUAL.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.238
<i>CAPCOM, THIS
IS PHEBUS TEN.</i>

40:13.328 --> 40:15.786
IT'S A REAL
FIREBALL OUT THERE.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.203
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

40:17.290 --> 40:18.655
WHAT'S YOUR
GENERAL CONDITION?

40:18.750 --> 40:20.115
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

40:20.209 --> 40:22.917
I'M FEELING...
I'M FEELING FINE.

40:23.004 --> 40:24.870
CONDITION IS GOOD.

40:24.964 --> 40:28.582
<i>THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT
OF FIRE OUT THERE.</i>

40:28.676 --> 40:32.044
CAPCOM...

40:32.138 --> 40:34.300
ONE LAST QUESTION:

40:34.390 --> 40:36.301
GO AHEAD, BOB.
GO AHEAD.

40:36.392 --> 40:43.640
WHO'S THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES?

40:43.733 --> 40:45.440
SAY AGAIN,
WOULD YOU, BOB?

40:45.526 --> 40:48.018
WE DON'T THINK WE
GOT THAT. SAY AGAIN.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.275
WHO IS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES?

40:51.366 --> 40:54.825
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING
VVHO THE PRESIDENT IS.

40:54.911 --> 40:57.278
THAT'S PRECISELY
THE QUESTION.

40:57.372 --> 41:04.460
<i>[hissing and static]</i>

41:04.545 --> 41:08.630
I HOPE YOU
SAID KENNEDY.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.673
I HOPE YOU
SAID KENNEDY.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.102
(male doctor) GO OPEN
THE BLINDS, NURSE.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.903
(female nurse)
YES, DOCTOR.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.246
OUR WANDERING
BOY IS AWAKE.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.074
BILL.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.909
<i>RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.</i>

41:46.004 --> 41:49.542
HOW YOU
FEELING, GAINES?

41:49.632 --> 41:51.873
THAT DEPENDS.

41:51.968 --> 41:54.926
DID YOU HEAR THAT LAST
QUESTION I ASKED UP THERE?

41:55.013 --> 41:56.469
JUST BEFORE REENTRY?

41:56.556 --> 41:58.513
YOU ASKED WHO
THE PRESIDENT IS.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.556
WAS THAT SOME
SORT OF A GAG?

42:00.643 --> 42:01.974
I DIDN'T HEAR
THE ANSWER.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.176
AND IT WAS NO GAG.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.103
PRESIDENT KENNEDY.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.931
<i>YOU WERE ONLY GONE TWO DAYS,
MAJOR, NOT TWO YEARS.</i>

42:13.823 --> 42:17.817
VVHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SECOND MORNING,
GAINES, ABOUT YOUR 15th ORBIT?

42:17.910 --> 42:21.699
VVE LOST ALL CONTACT VVITH YOU FOR
A PERIOD OF ALMOST SIX HOURS.

42:21.789 --> 42:25.248
NO RADAR, NO
CONTACT AT ALL.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.622
WE COULDN'T FIND OUT
WHAT WAS WRONG HERE.

42:28.713 --> 42:31.546
AND VVE ASKED YOU THAT
QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES

42:31.632 --> 42:34.715
<i>AFTER WE PICKED YOU UP
AGAIN, BUT YOU IGNORED IT.</i>

42:34.802 --> 42:36.759
SIX HOURS?

42:36.846 --> 42:38.382
THAT'S HOW
LONG IT TOOK.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.134
THEN YOU CAME BACK
IN LOUD AND CLEAR.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.181
I THINK LATER, SIR.

42:42.268 --> 42:46.728
RIGHT NOW, I THINK
HE SHOULD REST.

42:46.773 --> 42:48.480
BILL...

42:48.566 --> 42:50.227
<i>SOMETHING- - - SOME
THING HAPPENED.</i>

42:50.318 --> 42:52.525
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

42:52.612 --> 42:57.027
I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
THAT I BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.323
THERE'S ANOTHER DIMENSION.

42:59.410 --> 43:03.153
I DON'T KNOVV HOVV IT
EXISTS OR VVHERE IT EXISTS.

43:03.247 --> 43:07.662
<i>BUT THERE'S ANOTHER
WORLD, PARALLEL TO CURS-</i>

43:07.752 --> 43:10.619
THE SAME PEOPLE,
THE SAME PLACES,

43:10.713 --> 43:13.546
<i>MOST OF THE SAME
CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS.</i>

43:13.633 --> 43:15.499
<i>EXCEPT, NOW AND THEN,</i>

43:15.593 --> 43:17.175
<i>THERE'S' SOMETHING A
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:18.592
HOVV DO YOU KNOVV ALL THIS?

43:18.638 --> 43:20.470
BECAUSE I WAS
THERE, GENERAL.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.422
I WAS THERE FOR
ALMOST A WEEK.

43:22.475 --> 43:24.011
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.888
VVE ONLY LOST YOU FOR
ABOUT SIX HOURS.

43:25.978 --> 43:28.766
VVE HAD CONTACT VVITH YOU
ALL THE REST OF THE TIME.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.397
I CAN'T HELP THAT, SIR.

43:30.483 --> 43:33.771
DURING THAT SIX HOURS,
I LIVED OUT A WEEK.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.693
DOING WHAT?

43:35.780 --> 43:38.863
LOOKING AT OUR OOUNTERPARTS.
LOOKING AT US.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.691
US?

43:40.785 --> 43:43.277
US, AS WE EXIST
IN A PARALLEL WORLD.

43:43.371 --> 43:46.784
ONE THAT EXISTS ALONGSIDE,
BUT WHICH WE CAN'T SEE.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.660
IT'S THE WORLD
I STUMBLED INTO.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.492
<i>I DON'T KNOW HOW.</i>

43:50.586 --> 43:52.873
<i>SOME KIND OF
SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM,</i>

43:52.964 --> 43:55.126
<i>SOME WARPAGE.</i>

43:55.216 --> 43:58.083
BUT THERE'S A DOORVVAY UP
THERE SOMEWHERE INTO IT.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.793
IT EXISTS.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.424
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

44:02.515 --> 44:05.678
FOR SOMEBODY TO FALL
THROUGH IT, AND I DID.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.805
HOW DID YOU
GET BACK, BOB?

44:07.895 --> 44:09.727
<i>I DON'T EVEN
KNOW THAT.</i>

44:09.814 --> 44:14.229
ALL I CAN REMEMBER IS RUNNING
TOVVARD THE SPACECRAFT.

44:14.318 --> 44:18.562
AND THEN... I WAS
UP THERE AGAIN...

44:18.656 --> 44:19.942
AND THEN I WAS
BACK HERE.

44:23.828 --> 44:26.445
WELL...

44:26.539 --> 44:28.701
BOB,I
THINK, UH...

44:28.791 --> 44:31.624
<i>SLEEP ON THIS FOR A
LITTLE WHILE, WILL YOU?</i>

44:31.711 --> 44:32.746
WHY?

44:32.837 --> 44:34.453
WELL, BECAUSE...

44:34.547 --> 44:38.131
I THINK, UH... THIS MAY
JUST BE A DELUSION.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.719
<i>DELUSION?</i>

44:39.802 --> 44:42.760
BILL, I CAN RECOUNT
TO YOU EVERY MINUTE

44:42.847 --> 44:44.838
AND EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED.

44:44.932 --> 44:49.551
EVERY LINE OF DIALOG,
EVERY PERSON THAT I MET.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.761
I COULD RECALL TO YOU
THE STREETS,

44:51.856 --> 44:53.563
THE PLACES, EVERYTHING.

44:53.649 --> 44:57.187
THIS WAS NO DELUSION.
IT WAS NO DREAM.

44:57.278 --> 45:00.737
OH, I HAVE NO PROOF.
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.359
MM-HMM.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.691
WELL, UM,
OKAY, MAJOR...

45:04.785 --> 45:09.074
WE'LL, UM, TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

45:09.165 --> 45:12.078
DID ANYBODY
PHONE HELEN?

45:12.168 --> 45:16.787
<i>SHE, UH... ASKED WHAT
YOU WANTED FOR SUPPER.</i>

45:16.881 --> 45:19.873
WILL I BE
ABLE TO LEAVE?

45:19.967 --> 45:22.004
AT LEAST FOR AN OVERNIGHT.
MM-HMM.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.007
I VVANT YOU BACK FIRST THING IN
THE MORNING FOR SOME CRITIQUE.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.805

45:32.438 --> 45:34.896
MEANWHILE, GET
SOME REST, MAJOR.

45:43.616 --> 45:45.357
ONE LAST QUESTION.

45:45.451 --> 45:47.158
BE MY GUEST.

45:47.245 --> 45:50.158
IF WE EACH HAVE
A COUNTERPART,

45:52.959 --> 45:54.449
WHERE WAS
YOURS, BOB?

45:54.543 --> 45:57.581
I DON'T KNOVV, BUT
HE VVAS A COLONEL.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.003
A FULL COLONEL.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.922
I HOPE HE GOT BACK,

46:01.008 --> 46:03.466
'CAUSE HE HAS
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WIFE

46:03.552 --> 46:08.171
AND A VERY LOVELY
LITTLE DAUGHTER.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.802
I HOPE HE GOT BACK.

46:26.158 --> 46:27.774
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

46:27.868 --> 46:29.609
UH-UH.

46:29.704 --> 46:31.115
I DON'T THINK.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.663

THIS ONE, SIR.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.490

OF TRAUMA...?

46:35.584 --> 46:38.497
SOMETHING TO SET HIM
TILT LIKE THAT? I...

46:38.587 --> 46:39.998
CAN WE CALL
IT "TILT," SIR?

46:40.089 --> 46:42.046
OH, WHAT ELSE?
ANOTHER DIMENSION?

46:42.133 --> 46:46.969
ANOTHER VVORLD PARALLEL TO OURS?
YOU CALL THAT RATIONAL?

46:47.013 --> 46:48.924
UP THERE, WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S RATIONAL

46:49.015 --> 46:50.926
AND WHAT ISN'T?

46:51.017 --> 46:52.553
VVE DON'T E\/EN KNOVV THE RULES,

MADE IT TO THE DESERT.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.150
NOW WE SAY WE'VE
CONQUERED THE SAHARA

47:03.195 --> 47:05.527
AND WE HAVEN'T
CONQUERED ANYTHING.

47:05.614 --> 47:08.447
VVE'RE ONLY STARTING TO FIND
THE MYSTERIES, GENERAL.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.071
WE HAVEN'T EVEN
BEGUN TO SOLVE THEM.

47:11.162 --> 47:13.369
WE'RE GOING TO DO
A LOT OF GROPING

47:13.456 --> 47:14.992
THROUGH A LOT
OF DARK NIGHTS,

47:15.041 --> 47:16.748
THROUGH A LOT
OF DARK SPACE

47:16.834 --> 47:20.702
BEFORE WE FIND THE CLUES,
LET ALONE THE ANSWERS.

47:20.796 --> 47:25.757

WAY TO GO, SIR.

<i>(officer)

47:37.396 --> 47:38.898
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
AS WE GOT IT.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.767
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
MUCH SENSE.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.099
LET ME BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.
VVHAT'S THE MESSAGE?

47:43.194 --> 47:44.776
CAPCOM REPORTS TELEMETRY

47:44.862 --> 47:48.776

SPACE VEHICLE.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.368

47:50.451 --> 47:51.782
YES, SIR. THEY HAD
VOICE COMMUNICATION

47:51.869 --> 47:53.655
FOR ABOUT A
MINUTE AND A HALF.

47:53.746 --> 47:55.862
THE SPACECRAFT IDENTIFIED
ITSELF AS ASTRO <i>SEVEN,</i>

47:55.956 --> 47:57.287
<i>AND THE PERSON
IN IT SAID--</i>

47:57.375 --> 47:59.207
WHAT'D HE SAY?
WHAT'D HE SAY?

47:59.251 --> 48:01.538
HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS
A COLONEL ROBERT GAINES.

48:01.587 --> 48:04.921
<i>HE ASKED FOR
REENTRY DATA.</i>

48:05.007 --> 48:07.294
<i>COLONEL ROBERT GAINES?</i>

48:13.974 --> 48:16.762
VVE LOST THE VISUAL SIGHTING.
VVE LOST ALL VOICE.

48:51.470 --> 48:54.258
ONE THING. I'D LIKE TO
