I was so [bleep] depressed.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.558
I was like...I even told him
one day, I was like,

19:19.625 --> 19:21.293
"If I have to keep going on
like this,

19:21.360 --> 19:23.228
I'm gonna [bleep] kill myself."

19:23.295 --> 19:25.330
And I felt so down on myself

19:25.397 --> 19:27.332
that I had to call off
picking up Leah

19:27.399 --> 19:28.367
a couple Wednesdays
because of it.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.502
{\an1}- A couple times.
She couldn't get out of bed.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.738
- I didn't want Leah
to see me that way,

19:32.804 --> 19:36.174
{\an3}but what was going on
with Leah hurt me so bad.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.310
{\an3}I felt like she hated me
that I hated myself.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.780
- I think that was
the toughest test,

19:41.847 --> 19:43.815
{\an1}and the good thing is it wasn't
really that much of a test,

19:43.882 --> 19:46.485
{\an1}but the test of sobriety
that we've had.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.287
It was a tough time.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.556
- Well, and I just feel like
it's just gonna get better

19:50.622 --> 19:52.357
and better
now that you're over here,

19:52.424 --> 19:54.393
and you can see her
so much more.

19:54.459 --> 19:55.661
- It will.
- It's gonna feel more secure

19:55.727 --> 19:58.397
'cause you're
in the same place.

19:58.463 --> 20:00.732
- Yeah, I just want Boo Boo
to be happy.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.477
{\an8}- I'm tired.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.546
- It was fun, though.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.916
I probably should have texted
Ryan to invite him,

20:17.983 --> 20:20.752
but, oh, well.

20:20.819 --> 20:25.591
I honestly am surprised
that this child hasn't come yet.

20:25.657 --> 20:30.262
I live my everyday life
like I'm not two weeks from...

20:30.329 --> 20:32.230
- His due date.
- My due date.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.333
- I tried to get you
to rest that one day.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.702
- There's too much to do.

20:36.768 --> 20:40.839
I mean, you all need dinner
and clean clothes to wear,

20:40.906 --> 20:42.741
and Bentley has ball practice,

20:42.808 --> 20:45.611
and we have a company to run.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.814
If you want me to just
literally lay in bed all day,

20:48.880 --> 20:50.849
then I will gladly do that,

20:50.916 --> 20:52.718
but I think,
by the time I got up,

20:52.784 --> 20:55.687
the rest of the house
would probably be burnt down.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.789
- No.
- Okay.

20:59.958 --> 21:03.895
{\an8}<i>[mellow instrumentals]</i>

21:03.962 --> 21:06.398
{\an8}<i>- What are we talking</i>
<i>about today,</i>

21:06.465 --> 21:08.634
{\an9}how I didn't get invited
to the birthday?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.636
{\an8}Maybe they didn't
want me to come.

21:10.702 --> 21:12.604
{\an9}Maybe they just
wanted y'all to come.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.573
{\an8}- I mean, you didn't really want
to go, did you?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.475
{\an9}- If she would have said,
"Hey, Jayde's party is tonight,

21:16.541 --> 21:19.044
{\an9}would you like to come?"
Yes, I would have said yes.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.447
{\an3}But since I did not get a text
message, no, I did not go.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.449
- Okay.
- Ryan, you should talk to Maci

21:24.516 --> 21:26.051
{\an1}about getting more time
with Bentley,

21:26.118 --> 21:27.719
especially Wednesday nights

21:27.786 --> 21:29.488
{\an1}because there's nothing
going on Wednesdays.

21:29.554 --> 21:30.722
{\an3}- That's what I've been
saying.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.324
{\an3}That would help me out
because if I don't--

21:32.391 --> 21:33.825
{\an3}If I have him every
single weekend--

21:33.892 --> 21:35.861
- There's always games.
- But I would say...

21:35.927 --> 21:37.829
{\an1}- Not that you attend
every game.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.898
{\an3}- I mean, I go to
all these tournament games

21:39.965 --> 21:41.400
'cause they're so close.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.770
{\an1}- Yeah.

21:44.836 --> 21:46.738
{\an1}You might want to talk to her
before she gives birth,

21:46.805 --> 21:49.808
{\an1}because after that she's gonna
be very insane busy.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.078
- I understand that.
- Okay, that sounds good.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.747
{\an1}Are you gonna go see
the new one at the hospital?

21:55.814 --> 21:56.948
- Yeah, yeah.
- I am.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.517
- I am too.
- I'm gonna go.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.151
- We'll be there.
- I want to be there

21:59.217 --> 22:00.752
for Bentley and everybody.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.021
{\an3}- As long as, you know,
I get a call and say,

22:03.088 --> 22:05.590
"Hey, would you like to come?"
- Well, I'll let you know.

22:19.738 --> 22:20.972
- We can rip this one open.
I'm gonna start

22:21.039 --> 22:22.741
ripping up the night stands,
busting those out,

22:22.808 --> 22:25.510
then we'll just go
from there, I guess.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.012
{\an8}- I mean, I think Farrah
got a lot done today, no?

22:27.079 --> 22:29.047
{\an8}- Yeah, I guess so.

22:29.114 --> 22:30.782
- Do you have any idea
of what tomorrow's schedule is

22:30.849 --> 22:32.551
or anything that's happening?
- I have no idea.

22:32.617 --> 22:33.919
{\an1}I mean, nothing's, like,
done in order.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.654
It should have been flooring
should have got done first,

22:35.721 --> 22:37.989
{\an1}then the paint,
and then everything else.

22:38.056 --> 22:40.358
It goes in a cycle, but--

22:40.425 --> 22:41.526
- But did you guys sit down

22:41.593 --> 22:42.861
and try
to plan [bleep] out or no?

22:42.928 --> 22:45.063
{\an1}- No, she just likes
to do things on her own.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.099
{\an1}She drives me crazy.
She's nuts.

22:47.165 --> 22:49.634
- If you guys just organized it
and had a schedule, like,

22:49.701 --> 22:51.470
we're going off her schedule.
- Exactly.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.004
What you just said, 100%.

22:53.071 --> 22:54.773
If it was organized exactly
how you said it, it would--

22:54.840 --> 22:56.875
{\an3}- Well, why don't you guys
do that?

22:56.942 --> 22:58.610
{\an3}Why don't you communicate
and like, "Here's your schedule,

22:58.677 --> 23:00.579
let's divide this time for..."

23:00.645 --> 23:02.380
- That's something
you got to ask her

23:02.447 --> 23:04.483
because she obviously thinks
I don't know what I'm doing,

23:04.549 --> 23:07.018
{\an1}but, you know, that's her thing.
So I'm not gonna interrupt.

23:07.085 --> 23:11.123
{\an1}I'm just gonna stay quiet,
get [bleep] done, and that's it.

23:11.189 --> 23:13.525
{\an3}- I think you guys are just not
on the same page, Simon.

23:13.592 --> 23:14.926
- Yeah, I don't even know

23:14.993 --> 23:18.063
{\an1}what the hell's going on,
to be honest with you.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.799
- I feel like I didn't
get enough done today.

23:20.866 --> 23:22.601
I still need to go
to the [bleep] store

23:22.667 --> 23:24.503
and go get [bleep]
I wanted to do.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.038
- And Home Depot
has 30% off right now.

23:27.105 --> 23:29.574
- Well, Mom, I was trying
to find Home Depot,

23:29.641 --> 23:31.943
but because everyone else,
such as Simon,

23:32.010 --> 23:33.979
was acting like
a [bleep] baby today,

23:34.045 --> 23:36.148
I wasted my time with furniture.
- Here, I'll find it.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.983
{\an3}- Mom, I already know
where it is.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.519
{\an3}I've been trying to get there
for [bleep] five hours.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.187
- Farrah, I'm not a mind reader.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.923
{\an1}You said you couldn't find it
or you needed help.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.691
- No, I just have to yell
at you five [bleep] times.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.460
{\an1}- No, you don't.
I'm highly intelligent.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.028
I'm highly functioning.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.597
- Nope, nope, clearly not.

23:52.664 --> 23:56.201
Simon didn't even get all his
furniture he was supposed to.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.803
He complained about everything.

23:57.869 --> 24:01.173
Like, it was just
all over the place crazy.

24:01.239 --> 24:04.910
Like, he thinks
it's [bleep] funny to say to me,

24:04.976 --> 24:07.012
"Oh, I'm buying you
this furniture

24:07.078 --> 24:10.448
because I feel like
being nice today," or whatever.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.684
He owes me [bleep] money.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.587
No, he's a [bleep] liar,
a scam artist,

24:15.654 --> 24:17.889

had a tournament last weekend.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.220
Probably total
played eight games.

33:09.287 --> 33:12.090
Ryan showed up to one of them

33:12.156 --> 33:14.258
when there was ten minutes
left in the game.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.161
I'm like, "You spent more time
in the car driving there

33:17.228 --> 33:20.398

spent at the ball field."

33:20.465 --> 33:24.402

to the point to where it's like,

33:24.469 --> 33:28.005
"Okay, if Ryan doesn't show up,

33:28.072 --> 33:31.542
you're not going to
Jen and Larry's."

33:31.609 --> 33:34.479
I am literally
eight months pregnant,

33:34.545 --> 33:38.549

single game on time.

33:38.616 --> 33:40.518
He doesn't have
any other children.

33:40.585 --> 33:42.320

anything else to do.

He has no excuses.
There are no excuses.

33:48.159 --> 33:51.262
It's that he doesn't care.

33:51.329 --> 33:54.732
If he cared,
he would be there.

33:54.799 --> 34:00.204
{\an1}- I genuinely think
he does...not...get it.

34:00.271 --> 34:03.274
- He doesn't get it
because he never had to grow up.

34:03.341 --> 34:05.476
- Right.
- He's 28 years old.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.445

and does his laundry

34:07.512 --> 34:09.547

34:16.286 --> 34:19.257

He's never had to do anything.

34:19.322 --> 34:21.659
Ever.

34:25.228 --> 34:30.268

my mom and, like, Simon.

35:08.706 --> 35:12.176

to know the down low.

35:12.243 --> 35:13.878

tearing me down all the time.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.149

dropping--I don't know
if he's dropping off a truck--

35:19.684 --> 35:21.552
- San Diego?
- No, he's here.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.621
- Okay. Maybe that's why
he thinks he feels owed

35:23.688 --> 35:25.256
{\an3}because he helps you
with things,

35:25.323 --> 35:26.824
{\an3}but that's supposed
to be a man.

35:26.891 --> 35:28.759
- Like, if you love someone
and you're a real man,

35:28.826 --> 35:31.662
you can do, like, 500 things
at one time and help me

35:31.729 --> 35:33.898

because it's, like, what you do.

seem like he's for you.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.170
{\an3}You don't have people on
your side and they're your team.

35:39.237 --> 35:41.539
- Yeah, and I feel like
he's trying to, like,

35:41.606 --> 35:43.841
just help to, like, control me.

35:43.908 --> 35:46.210

35:46.277 --> 35:48.179
I don't get it.

35:48.246 --> 35:49.413
{\an3}- Yeah.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.849
{\an1}- He says really
horrible things to me.

35:51.916 --> 35:55.286
{\an3}- I just think you can do
so much better.

35:55.353 --> 35:56.754

text messages...

35:56.821 --> 35:58.856
Like I told him
I was coming here with you

35:58.923 --> 36:01.792

some horrible things that just--

36:01.859 --> 36:05.329
like, if I was actually
a insecure woman,

36:05.396 --> 36:06.931
I'd be crying

36:06.998 --> 36:09.300
- But still, the closest people
to me are supposed to love me,

36:09.367 --> 36:12.203
not hurt me.
- Yeah.

36:12.270 --> 36:17.675

a breakup at this point for you.

{\an1}No PTSD.
You know, nothing like that.

38:13.357 --> 38:16.694
{\an3}- Wow, because you were, like,
for sure that you had, you know,

38:16.761 --> 38:18.529
{\an3}"There's something wrong
with me.

38:18.596 --> 38:21.832
{\an3}I'm gonna have this anxiety
for the rest of my life."

38:21.899 --> 38:23.768
{\an3}So, then,
what's the reason for it?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.336
- What, the reason
for my anxiety is?

38:25.403 --> 38:27.438
{\an3}- Yeah, so the reason of why
you were having--

38:27.505 --> 38:29.940
- My childhood for sure.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.909
{\an1}All the things
that I went through.

38:31.976 --> 38:37.348
{\an1}Like my two triggers are,
like, chaos and abandonment.

38:37.415 --> 38:40.351
{\an1}Like, growing up in an alcoholic
home and then also, like,

38:40.418 --> 38:41.752
with my dad leaving and stuff,

38:41.819 --> 38:43.087
for sure.
- Yeah.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.356
{\an1}- I just really want to focus
on, like,

38:45.423 --> 38:47.658
taking care of myself fully

38:47.725 --> 38:49.927
{\an1}and before taking care
of anybody else

38:49.994 --> 38:51.896
{\an1}because I'm just such, like,
a nurturer,

38:51.962 --> 38:54.065
{\an1}people pleasing person
because I've always had to be.

38:54.131 --> 38:58.569
- Right, and how do you do that?
- Doing things that I enjoy.

38:58.636 --> 38:59.637
- Right.
- Sticking to therapy

38:59.704 --> 39:01.439
and my psychiatrist
appointments.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.641
- How do you take care of
yourself and your relationships?

39:03.708 --> 39:05.776
- You set boundaries.
- Yes.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.511
{\an3}Set, like, boundaries
with the people

39:07.578 --> 39:09.847
that are closest to you mainly,

39:09.914 --> 39:12.450
{\an3}but everybody that's in
a close relationship

39:12.516 --> 39:13.851
with you, you will.

39:16.454 --> 39:19.957
{\an3}There's a confidence in you
that I didn't see before.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.894
- Thanks. You know,
I have to go out,

39:23.961 --> 39:26.964
and I have to continue
working on myself.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.900
- Okay.
- Because I'm not done yet.

40:51.148 --> 40:52.950
{\an1}- Co-parenting
has been challenging.

40:55.986 --> 40:57.521

- I don't want him around

He's a negative person,
and I cannot stand it.
