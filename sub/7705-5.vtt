WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.770
Well, what it boils down to is

00:04.772 --> 00:07.106
we've gotta take a closer look
at our bills.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.675
[grunts]

00:09.677 --> 00:12.311
Hey! What's going on in here?

00:12.313 --> 00:13.946
We're having a family meeting.

00:13.948 --> 00:17.549
Oh, I get it.
Freeze out the alien.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.818
I guess I'm not part
of the family.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.488
Uh, ALF, we thought you were
watching "The Three Stooges."

00:22.490 --> 00:24.490
I turned it off.

00:24.492 --> 00:28.460
Somehow I just can't buy
Shemp as a surgeon.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.829
- Curly was a senator once.
- True.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.732
And Moe was speaker
of the house.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.635
Could we, uh, put an end to the
stooge talk here for a minute?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.003
[imitating Curly]
Certainly.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.039
[gibberish]

00:42.343 --> 00:43.976
We'd like to get back
to our meeting.

00:43.978 --> 00:47.479
Oh, yeah.
The meeting I wasn't invited to.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.481
It's, uh, it's about
our family budget.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.983
What'd you think
I was going to do?

00:50.985 --> 00:53.352
Dominate the conversation?
Be a nuisance?

00:53.354 --> 00:54.686
No, ALF, nobody ever suggest--

00:54.688 --> 00:56.989
Throw up a lot of
pointless suggestions?

00:56.991 --> 00:58.757
- Interrupt everybody?
- Ah, we never said--

00:58.759 --> 01:00.426
Never let anyone get a word
in edgewise--

01:00.428 --> 01:04.530
ALF!
You can come to the meeting.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.131
No, thanks.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.835

[no audio]

02:10.764 --> 02:12.064
Let's just take a look at
our electric bill for example

02:12.066 --> 02:13.932
it's three times
what it used to be.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.735
Maybe it's the porch light you
leave on every time I go out.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.904
Porch light stays.

02:18.906 --> 02:23.609
[chuckles]
And we've been keeping
the thermostat down to 70.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.578
And I turn off the dryer
as soon as I wake up.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.648
Well, we're just going..
The, the dryer?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.650
What do you mean
turn off the dryer?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.652
Why, why would you
even turn it on?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.921
To keep me company at night.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.824
Why? Is eight hours too long?

02:38.826 --> 02:39.925
Yes.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.628
What if I just leave it
on delicates?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.363
Leave it off.

02:44.365 --> 02:47.699
Now, let's get back to
the rest of our money problems.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.435
No chance of your getting
a better job I suppose.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.639
I like my job.
The money's fine.

02:53.641 --> 02:57.476
Who made this call to Munich?
Munich, Germany?

02:57.478 --> 03:00.145
Munich?
That has to be a mistake.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.181
No, it's not.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.650
You called Munich. Why?

03:04.652 --> 03:05.984
Remember the vacuum cleaner
I broke?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.386
Yeah.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.455
Well, the repair place said they
couldn't get the chicken salad

03:10.457 --> 03:12.224
out of the impeller blade

03:12.226 --> 03:14.793
and they had to send it
to Germany for an overhaul.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.364
That doesn't explain
why you'd call Germany.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.067
Hey, I believe in following
things through.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.038
Let's move on to
another problem.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.107
- Food.
- I'm gonna go get some cookies.

03:31.045 --> 03:35.214
I don't think that all of us
are aware how much food costs.

03:35.216 --> 03:39.117
We're all out of macaroons.
All we got are chocolate chips.

03:41.488 --> 03:46.291
Let alone how much food is being
consumed for that matter.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.094
Is something wrong?

03:50.531 --> 03:51.997
You're eating all our food.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.266
All the food?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.904
Except the stuff
that lands on the floor.

04:01.175 --> 04:05.377
Okay, I'm beginning to realize
what this is all about.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.546
You all think I'm a parasite.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.249
No one thinks you're a parasite.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.384
Alright. A freeloader?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.286
Freeloader is closer.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.954
What about a sponger?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.422
Where did you ever
hear that word?

04:17.424 --> 04:20.425
That's what<i> you</i> called him
last week.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.927
Oh, I see.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.230
Let's just settle on parasite
and move on.

04:25.232 --> 04:29.568
Fine. If you want me,
I'll be in my room.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.271
Not wasting money.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.141
[piano music]

04:44.918 --> 04:49.121
¶ I just checked into
the Parasite Hotel ¶

04:51.225 --> 04:54.860
¶ They ain't got a porter
or a bell ¶

04:56.263 --> 05:00.299
¶ I checked in
to that Parasite Hotel ¶¶

05:00.301 --> 05:02.668
- ALF!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.336
Was I playing too loud?

05:04.338 --> 05:06.838
I didn't know
you could play the piano.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.340
Well, I was winging it.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.876
It's tough to play
without the red keys.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.945
You seem kinda down.

05:13.947 --> 05:18.350
Maybe I'm being overly sensitive
about being called a freeloader

05:18.352 --> 05:21.119
sponger and parasite.

05:21.121 --> 05:25.257
Oh, ALF, we didn't mean to call
you any of those things.

05:25.259 --> 05:28.660
You, you just happened
to catch us in a moment of..

05:28.662 --> 05:30.462
Honesty.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.265
It's just a matter of making
a few adjustments. You know we--

05:33.267 --> 05:37.636
No need to lay it out, Kateski.
I hear you loud and clear.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.805
I've gotta get a job.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.840
- A job?
- That's right.

05:41.842 --> 05:46.445
It's nose to the grindstone time
for this parasite.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.880
But, um, what could you even do?

05:48.882 --> 05:52.317
Well, on Melmac,
I owned and operated

05:52.319 --> 05:54.353
my own phlegm dealership.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.888
Phlegm dealership?

05:56.890 --> 06:00.892
Ever tried one?
The phlegm turbo was a classic.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.895
Must be some other options.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.230
Well, there was a sunroof

06:05.232 --> 06:08.834
but, uh, it was best
to keep it closed.

06:08.836 --> 06:12.137
Now, you don't need
to get a job.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.506
Listen, if you really wanna
contribute

06:14.508 --> 06:16.541
we'll give you a few chores
to do around the house.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.176
How would that be?

06:18.178 --> 06:21.079
You mean fluffing up pillows?
Stuff like that?

06:21.081 --> 06:24.182
Well, no, but you could, uh,
help fold laundry

06:24.184 --> 06:26.985
load the dishwasher.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.288
No. No, not that.
We'll think of something.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.494
Don't worry about it.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.831
Chores, fine for the beaver

06:39.833 --> 06:43.101
but not exactly
tycoon territory.

06:43.103 --> 06:47.038
Ah, I've gotta find a way
to earn money now.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.407
But how?

06:51.345 --> 06:55.414
"Looking for a way
to earn money now?

06:55.416 --> 06:58.517
Call this toll-free number."

06:58.519 --> 07:01.286
Opportunity knocks.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.866
Well, hello!
Yeah, uh, when do I start?

07:14.868 --> 07:17.769
Huh? Oh, oh, ALF.
My name is ALF.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.139
Yeah.
Have I earned any money yet?

07:21.141 --> 07:24.109
What do you mean
I have to sell something first?

07:24.111 --> 07:27.579
Alright, fine. Send it here
and I'll sell it.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.981
Uh, 167 Hemdale.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.717
It's a beige house.
You can't miss it.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.719
Yeah, great.
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.489
Before I forget.
One more question.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.991
What am I gonna be selling?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.726
ALF, this package is for you.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.462
Oh, it's here. Yeah.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.763
What's here? What is it?

07:44.765 --> 07:45.897
Can I open it?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.666
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.335
Let's not get impatient,
shall we?

07:53.073 --> 07:56.174
Tastefully packaged?
Well, I guess so.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.111
ALF, these are cosmetics.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.848
That's right, cosmetics.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.083
This must be
the earlobe freshener.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.253
ALF, what are you doing
with cosmetics?

08:08.255 --> 08:11.523
Huh? Oh, didn't I tell you?
I got a job.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.825
I'm a Terry Faith girl.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.026
I thought you were an alien.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.596
Why can't I have
the best of both worlds?

08:17.598 --> 08:20.031
But, ALF, how can you sell
Terry Faith cosmetics?

08:20.033 --> 08:23.268
Lynn, honey, I know exactly
what you're gonna say.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.337
I can't do
the public number, right?

08:25.339 --> 08:28.039
Ha! Well, just send
that worry packing.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.275
I make it all happen
over the phone.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.010
But don't you have to know
something about makeup

08:32.012 --> 08:33.445
before you can sell it?

08:33.447 --> 08:36.014
That's the great thing
about this company.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.384
They welcome ignorance.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.488
Have you ever had
a Terry Faith facial?

08:43.490 --> 08:44.990
Can't say that I have.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.958
You don't know anything
about this stuff.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.494
Honey, honey,
that's why we have this book.

08:49.496 --> 08:53.164
"The Wonderful World Of
Terry Faith Cosmetics."

08:53.166 --> 08:56.301
Let's check it out here.
Here we go.

08:56.303 --> 09:00.071
"Terry Faith was born
outside of Dayton, Ohio

09:00.073 --> 09:03.341
at a bend in the road
near the turn of the century."

09:03.343 --> 09:05.076
What does it says about
how to give a facial?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.912
Don't you wanna hear about
the early years?

09:06.914 --> 09:08.346
- I do.
- I don't.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.849
- Let's skip to the facial part.
- Alright, okay.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.083
Here we go.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.320
"Chapter I, the facial part."

09:15.322 --> 09:17.722
Here, hold this.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.990
Let's see here.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.826
This must be the stuff.

09:21.828 --> 09:25.564
Come on, Lynn, get down here.
Let's give it a shot.

09:25.566 --> 09:28.466
It says apply liberally
to customer's face and neck.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.070
What do you think?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.605
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.609
[humming]

09:37.611 --> 09:39.277
Yeah.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.847
Yeah, here it's going on
real smooth.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.216
- Just, just a little bit.
- It says apply liberally.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.218
Okay. Okay, apply liberally.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.219
Alright, that's what I'm doing.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.254
- Alright.
- Alright.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.855
Here we go. I'm applying it.

09:50.857 --> 09:51.957
- Okay
- Good. Okay. Good.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.893
Now, uh, now for cheek color

09:54.895 --> 09:58.396
I think Terry suggests
something like, uh

09:58.398 --> 09:59.731
Evening Lobster.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.566
- Can I see a mirror?
- Not yet, not yet.

10:01.568 --> 10:05.003
Now, I want you to suck in those
cheeks real tight. Like this.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.940
Superb. Let's do this.

10:08.942 --> 10:13.044
Here we go.
Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.246
Here, uh, missed a spot
right there.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.283
- Great. Oh.
- Okay. Now can I see a mirror?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.085
I don't think you want to.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.920
My work speaks for itself.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.722
Come on. Let me have it.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.393
I'm gonna go wash my face.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.794
You didn't let it harden.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.363
Before it hardens.

10:32.766 --> 10:37.602
Brian, I'm in business.
My freeloader days are numbered.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.772
- What about your parasite days?
- Hey, come on now.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.775
Just help me pack this stuff up
and carry it to my room.

Hello, Ging. Darling!

11:01.762 --> 11:03.695
Oh, I just got the package.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.697
It's divine.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.499
Yeah, the lipsticks?

11:07.501 --> 11:10.669
I didn't know there were
so many luscious colors.

11:10.671 --> 11:15.940
Yeah. Oh, that tangerine tango
is exquisite.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.710
What? Couple of extra cases?

11:18.712 --> 11:21.312
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Mm-hmm, yeah.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.314
Yeah, send 'em over.
I'll move 'em.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.817
Yeah, just put it on my account.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.120
Yeah, okay. Thank you.<i> Ciao.</i>

11:29.122 --> 11:32.490

- For the house.

He could be resting.

He could be reading.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.381
He could be carrying our towels
through the den.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.882
- Excuse me, ALF.
- Yo.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.351
Why are you carrying our towels
through the den?

12:00.353 --> 12:03.154
Aren't we
a curious George tonight?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.824
[telephone ringing]

12:05.826 --> 12:07.092
Hello.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.727
We'd like an answer
to that question.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.197
It's for you.
Someone named Ginger.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.865
Oh, ho..
Here, hold this, hold this.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.233
Yeah.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.702
Hello.

12:17.704 --> 12:21.906
Hiya, Ging.
Yeah, what's cookin'?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.342
Uh-huh.
Yeah, uh-huh, oh..

12:24.344 --> 12:26.311
How's Oscar's hernia?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.847
Oh, good, that's good news.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.618
Oh, Ging, I couldn't agree more.

12:33.620 --> 12:39.591
Yeah, those hunting sashes
are going to be very hot.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.093
Yeah, yeah,
send me a ton of those.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.895
A hunting sashes?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.698
Newcomer of the month?<i> Moi?</i>

12:46.700 --> 12:49.367
Ha! Well, I don't know
what to say.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.036
I'm floored. I'm agog.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.539
I'm absolutely silly.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.474
(ALF)
'Yeah, okay, look,
gotta run, hun.'

12:56.476 --> 12:58.710
Love to Bridget and Peg.
Bye-bye.

12:58.712 --> 12:59.944
[kissing]

12:59.946 --> 13:02.580
- Yeah.
- Alright, alright.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.048
Let's just start
at the beginning.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.717
Who's Ginger?

13:05.719 --> 13:09.087
And why are you talking to her
about hunting sashes

13:09.089 --> 13:10.989
and if you'll pardon
my ignorance

13:10.991 --> 13:13.658
what are hunting sashes?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.294
Alright.
I was gonna tell you anyway.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.164
I have a job.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.999
- A what?
- A job.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.834
I'm in the rouge-slinging game.

13:23.603 --> 13:24.636
What?

13:24.638 --> 13:27.605
That's a trade lingo
for beauty rep.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.441
- What?
- I'm selling cosmetics.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.678
ALF, I thought we decided
against your getting a job.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.280
This isn't a job.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.516
It's a glittering,
fast pace career.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.252
If I play my cards right,
I can bring home twice

13:41.254 --> 13:44.022
what the civil servant
here does.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.791
The civil servant doesn't
need you to sell cosmetics.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.761
The civil servant is doing
just fine. Thank you very much.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.198
Mom, where are all the tow..

13:53.200 --> 13:55.800
Oh, the towels are in here.

13:55.802 --> 13:59.304
ALF, ALF was just about
to tell us why.

13:59.306 --> 14:03.174
Well, maybe he needed
some storage space.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.376
Oh, you can drop the cover,
Lynn.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.812
I've blown the lid off
of the Operation Makeup.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.648
Lynn, you mean you knew about
this and didn't tell us?

14:10.650 --> 14:13.051
Well, ALF asked me
not to say anything

14:13.053 --> 14:16.621
until he made enough money to
bail out the civil servant.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.891
Yeah, I mean, I finally
feel like a productive

14:19.893 --> 14:21.292
member of society.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.494
I'm pulling my weight, Willie.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.397
By selling cosmetics?

14:26.399 --> 14:29.234
Yeah, dad. He's really
excited about working.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.635
Let's give him a chance.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.837
Yeah, yeah. Wait till you
check out these goods.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.239
I'll be right back.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.975
You know, Willie.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.978
Honey, it's kind of nice
that he wants to help us out.

14:39.980 --> 14:44.916
Well, I guess we should be
supportive...for a while.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.918
And then, if he does manage
to show a profit

14:46.920 --> 14:47.986
not that we need it.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.821
Alright, here we go.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.222
Sit down, Katydid.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.392
Let's try to reverse
the ravages of time.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.227
What?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.528
Hey, come on,
don't fight it, Kate.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.497
It happens to everyone, alright?

14:59.499 --> 15:02.367
Willie, do I look old?

15:02.369 --> 15:06.104
Why are you
even listening to him?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.505
He is a beauty consultant.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.275
- Kate, honey.
- 'Mm-hmm.'

15:10.277 --> 15:11.843
- Listen to me, alright?
- 'Yeah.'

15:11.845 --> 15:13.044
And I mean this.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.847
It's not that you look old

15:15.849 --> 15:19.951
it's, it's just that a woman
of such radiant beauty

15:19.953 --> 15:25.189
should let her, her
lasting loveliness bloom

15:25.191 --> 15:26.791
with the passage of time.

15:27.861 --> 15:30.595
- Oh, brother.
- No, let him talk.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.730
We're all gonna be supportive,
remember?

15:32.732 --> 15:35.233
Alright, uh, ALF, maybe,
maybe I'll buy something.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.101
Um, what do you recommend?

15:37.103 --> 15:39.904
Well, uh, I say that, uh..

15:39.906 --> 15:42.807
...our sub-reflective
chin buffing paste is a must.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.644
- Really? How much is that?
- Fifty dollars.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.446
Or twenty.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.814
How much you got?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.917
- Five.
- Sold.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.487
You got a real flair for the
business end of the thing too.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.424
Hey, I didn't get voted Newcomer
Of The Month for nothing.

15:59.426 --> 16:03.328
[scoffs]
How could you be voted
Newcomer Of The Month

16:03.330 --> 16:05.430
when you haven't sold
anything yet?

16:05.432 --> 16:09.934
Ha! It's not how much you sell,
it's how much you buy.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.270
[doorbell rings]

16:12.272 --> 16:15.606
Well...exactly how much
did you buy?

16:15.608 --> 16:17.008
I'll have to check
my day planner.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.678
[doorbell rings]

16:25.452 --> 16:27.085
- William Tanner?
- Yes.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.620
I've got a delivery here for you
from the Terry Faith company.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.790
Hold it! Wait. Just a minute.
I'm not signing anything.

16:32.792 --> 16:37.028
No signature's necessary. This
was all paid for over the phone.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.597
I'll be back with the rest
when I get a bigger truck.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.599
Keep the faith.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.470
Four thousand dollars.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.673
Yup, that matches my total.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.477
ALF, how were you able to
purchase $4000 worth of makeup?

16:52.479 --> 16:55.346
Plastic. I put it on your visa.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.382
Oh, incidentally,
you're over your limit.

16:58.852 --> 17:03.521
You used my credit card
to buy $4000 worth of makeup?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.523
Hey, what choice did I have?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.526
Banks don't give a line of
credit to people with one name.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.495
Except Madonna.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.063
I don't believe this.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.865
Come on, you'll get it all back.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.634
The markup on this stuff
is outrageous.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.970
Here, look, you're already
five bucks ahead.

17:18.972 --> 17:24.342
ALF! ALF, ALF, what do you do
when the stuff turns green?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.643
Well, let's see here.

17:26.913 --> 17:31.049
Dayton, Dayton..
Her first marriage, puffy eyes.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.351
"Return to Dayton."
Oh, here we go.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.086
"When things turn green."

17:36.523 --> 17:38.856
What, you're gonna leave
the kid looking like that?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.259
Lynn, go help your brother
take his makeup off.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.627
Okay. Come on.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.796
[sighs]

17:46.699 --> 17:51.069
You have abused the trust
of this family far too long.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.038
You're grounded!

17:54.040 --> 17:57.075
Oh! No phone, no television,
no nothing!

17:57.077 --> 17:59.243
Not until we get this
makeup mess straightened out.

17:59.245 --> 18:03.247
My career really threatens you,
doesn't it, Willie?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.083
Yes, financially.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.517
Life's funny.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.387
You try and help someone out
and boom

18:09.389 --> 18:11.689
they turn on you
like a wild animal!

18:12.258 --> 18:14.058
[doorbell rings]

18:14.060 --> 18:15.593
If that's a load
of your deliveryman--

18:15.595 --> 18:17.728
No, that's probably the girls.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.132
- The girls?
- I'm sorry. The women.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.234
- What women?
- The customers.

18:23.236 --> 18:26.237
The ones coming
to the Terry Faith party.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.939
That's what the towels were for.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.141
It is, it's women.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.311
You are not to entertain
customers in this house.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.280
Of course, I'm not.
You are.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.815
What do you mean we are?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.951
I was trying to explain it
to you.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.787
See, your role in
a Terry Faith's sales family

18:42.789 --> 18:46.257
is to play host and hostess
to my customers.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.093
I-i-if that means selling
your makeup, forget it!

18:49.095 --> 18:51.796
Willie, Willie,
these products sell themselves.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.798
[doorbell rings]
You don't have to do a thing.

18:54.767 --> 18:58.102
Except entertain
a houseful of strangers.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.138
Relax.
They'll be wearing name tags.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.572
[doorbell rings]

19:01.574 --> 19:05.176
Oh, and by the way,
don't take any personal checks.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.845
[knock on door]
Willie!

19:07.847 --> 19:09.614
Don't worry, don't worry.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.683
I'm gonna put an end to this
right now.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.318
- Ladies--
- Oh, hi.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.688
- Oh, what a beautiful house.
- Hi, hi. No, I'm not ALF.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.824
Oh, then you must be
his assistant, Willie.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.860
- Where's ALF?
- ALF is at a, uh--

19:22.862 --> 19:24.428
- The director's meeting.
- Ooh.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.465
Yes, right. Uh, ladies, if I may
have your attention, please.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.799
About these products--

19:28.801 --> 19:30.334
Willie, hun,
you don't have to sell us

19:30.336 --> 19:31.869
the products sell themselves.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.672
- I'll have an espresso.
- Oh, gee, that sounds good.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.107
Could you sprinkle a little
cinnamon on mine

19:36.109 --> 19:38.476
and don't bother
to heat the strudel.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.112
Espresso and strudel.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.880
Uh, listen, ladies,
I don't know what ALF told you

19:42.882 --> 19:44.315
about these cosmetics--

19:44.317 --> 19:45.983
Oh, never mind, here they are.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.819
Is it okay if we open these..
Stop.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.823
No, no.
That's not a good idea. No, no.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.059
- Oh, is that espresso coming?
- And strudel?

19:55.061 --> 19:56.460
Uh, I'll see.

19:56.462 --> 19:59.764
Oh, Willie, did the muffin-free
eye solvent finally come in?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.834
Kate.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.737
Tell the girls to hang on.
The food is on its way.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.374
Cinnamon.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.978
What am I doing? We don't even
have an espresso machine.

20:13.980 --> 20:17.148
Too bad. It's kinda standard
at these parties.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.250
Look, let them start on these.
I'll make some instant.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.887
You're not making anything.
The party is over.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.756
[doorbell rings]
Willie is not doing
his card tricks again, is he?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.558
Yeah, that's..

20:27.560 --> 20:29.527
- Hi.
- Oh, come in.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.530
Look, what...wait till you see.
They've got all the shades.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.898
- 'Wait..'
- Oh, that's wonderful.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.900
Oh, Willie,
I don't wanna ruin my manicure.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.869
Would you rub this in for me?

20:38.871 --> 20:43.107
- Oh...where?
- Wherever I need it.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.783
- Willie..
- Oh, hi, Kate.

20:52.785 --> 20:57.722
- Uh, can we change a $100 bill?
- A $100?

20:57.724 --> 20:59.090
Oh, Willie,
never mind the change.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.559
I'll take this
and the guacamole skin toner

21:01.561 --> 21:03.094
and we'll call it even.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.297
Guacamole skin toner.
I've gotta have some of that.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.266
Oh, did someone say guacamole?

21:08.268 --> 21:09.900
- Willie, what's going on?
- I don't know.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.902
But, uh,
I think we sold something.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.105
Willie, will you take
personal checks?

21:14.107 --> 21:16.307
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, should we?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.242
(ALF)
'Get some ID.'

21:18.244 --> 21:20.044
Get some ID.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.747
Willie, I think I bought enough
to qualify for the luggage.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.981
What luggage?

21:23.983 --> 21:25.216
Well, ALF told me
I get my choice

21:25.218 --> 21:27.318
of either soft sided
or mock Naugahyde

21:27.320 --> 21:29.720
and I'd like to see them
before I make my choice.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.656
I don't know
what you're talking about, lady.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.924
ALF said you'll try
to talk me out of it.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.227
Myrna, uh, forget the luggage.

21:36.229 --> 21:39.597
Just buy another $200 worth
and take the trip to Dayton.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.799
You'll love the museum.
It's marvelous.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.301
Great idea.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.103
Willie, honey, do you think
we're doing the right thing?

21:46.105 --> 21:47.905
I don't know.
We've got no choice.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.840
We're in this up to our necks.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.410
Necks?
Oh, that reminds me.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.446
Willie dear, where is that
neck tightener I ordered?

21:55.448 --> 21:57.281
Coming, bunny.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.849
I'll be right back, dear.

22:00.286 --> 22:01.852
Cheez Whiz?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.990
Hey, Tanner,
the rest of your stuff is here.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.359
Should I back the truck up to
the door or what?

22:09.295 --> 22:12.163
[instrumental music]

22:14.500 --> 22:16.200
[instrumental music]

22:19.138 --> 22:21.138
Well, all the figures are in.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.175
- How much did we make?
- Not so fast.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.710
I need a drumroll.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.977
Just tell us.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.246
I'm not telling you
until I get a drumroll.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.216
Give me that.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.451
Well..

22:33.453 --> 22:34.952
Now, we did pretty well.

22:34.954 --> 22:38.489
Pretty well? We made it all back
plus a small profit.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.292
Oh, boy, can we get
an air-hockey table?

22:41.294 --> 22:43.994
No, I think
we'll just use this money

22:43.996 --> 22:46.297
to pay for that phone call
to Munich.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.532
You know, if we have few more
of these parties--

22:48.534 --> 22:51.335
No, no more parties.
No more makeup.

22:51.337 --> 22:52.937
No more Terry Faith.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.474
Well, I want you all to know

22:56.476 --> 22:59.477
how much I appreciate
your giving me the chance.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.346
You came through for me,
and it all worked out

23:02.348 --> 23:06.016
and now,
I've got something for you.

23:06.018 --> 23:09.053
Lynn, tell them
what they've won.

23:09.055 --> 23:14.759
You have just won a beautiful
set of mock Naugahyde luggage.

23:16.162 --> 23:20.564
ALF, that is really,
really sweet.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.367
It looks just like
real Naugahyde.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.603
And that's only
the beginning, folks.

23:25.605 --> 23:29.340
Because next week,
we'll be packing those bags

23:29.342 --> 23:32.543
and leaving
for beautiful Dayton

23:32.545 --> 23:34.845
'where we'll be spending
three days and two nights'

23:34.847 --> 23:37.782
at the beautiful
Terryland Hotel.

23:37.784 --> 23:42.720
You'll be dancing and dining in
the beautiful eye shadow lounge

23:42.722 --> 23:45.956
and visiting
the Terry Faith museum

23:45.958 --> 23:49.193
where Terry herself
is on display

23:49.195 --> 23:52.463
gorgeously preserved in the
revolving crystal casket.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.133
"To preserve the dignity
of this monument

23:56.135 --> 23:58.302
there will be no
flash photography."

23:58.971 --> 24:02.139
[instrumental music]

24:03.876 --> 24:06.310
[theme music]

24:30.470 --> 24:32.303
