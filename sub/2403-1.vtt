00:50.133 --> 00:53.844
Sorry. You're right. We
barely know each other.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.347
Maybe we should have
a drink and talk.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.874
Actually...

00:58.016 --> 00:59.642
my zipper just got
caught on my necklace.

00:59.643 --> 01:02.754
But if you want to
talk, we can. Sure.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.090
Okay, great.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.258
Or we can talk after.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.761
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- Come on!
- No!

03:08.105 --> 03:10.648
Let me tag along for a drink.
You said I'd like it.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.316
It's too soon.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.944
Once you meet my dad
and I meet your friends,

03:14.945 --> 03:16.821
they become a part of this...

03:16.822 --> 03:19.156
and I just want to stay in
our bubble a little longer.

(GROANS)

03:44.141 --> 03:46.976
Why do I schedule
breakfast meetings?

03:46.977 --> 03:48.644
For the bacon, I think.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.314
But you need to lay off that until your
cholesterol's down. Why not turkey?

03:52.315 --> 03:55.025
Screw turkey. I like pig.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.695
Well, I heard a story
on the news...

03:57.696 --> 04:01.157
about a guy who ate an
undercooked pork chop and...

04:01.158 --> 04:04.910
got a worm that made his
brain swell up super fast.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.995
Uh-huh.

04:05.996 --> 04:10.207
And to relieve the pressure, they had
to cut out a chunk of his skull.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.375
Oh, wow.

04:11.376 --> 04:15.838
Like a triangle of his skull, they
cut it right out of his head...

04:15.839 --> 04:18.591
and they implanted
it in his groin...

04:18.591 --> 04:20.509
so it wouldn't die.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.762
Otherwise, his brain would have...

04:22.763 --> 04:25.014
his head would have exploded.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.140
Mmm-hmm.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.017
The skull was holding his brain...

04:28.018 --> 04:32.755
which was swelling, and his
head would have just exploded.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.567
Just think of that next
time you eat pig bacon.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.136
I will.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.614
Here you go.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.349

I'm taking him to

04:50.791 --> 04:53.626
Oh! And we need a check
for the painter, too.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.962
That reminds me, I need
you to sign these, honey.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.547
What are they?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.450
Oh, just some stuff
for the accountant.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.720
I don't even understand this.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.222
I can't even read these anymore.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.892
I already read it for us.
You just have to sign.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.977
No, I really don't understand this.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.271
I feel like I need
to go to brain camp.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.106
Like, a brain camp.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.109
Where they give you
exercises for your brain?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.111
When people have lazy eyes...

05:21.112 --> 05:22.905
they get their eyes worked out

05:22.906 --> 05:24.698
so they don't have to wear glasses.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.783
Mmm-hmm.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.326
They should have
that for your brain.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.744
Like a brain camp.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.956
You could go lay on
a beach and get tan

05:31.957 --> 05:33.749
and drink gingko balboa all day.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.860
You come back and
you're super smart.

of been in the zone here.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.109
You weren't going to mention these?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.887
Why? They're the first
things you see.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.824
Micromacks? I thought Dave Cohen
was handling this merger.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.951
No. The client said
he was too emotional.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.287
They wanted a ruthless
law robot, so...

06:11.288 --> 06:13.289
I got Micromacks.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.457
Get Dave on the phone. I need
all pertinent materials...

06:15.458 --> 06:18.627
and a set of dates for deposition.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.530
Why do you work so hard?

06:20.672 --> 06:23.799
The point of being pretty
is that you don't have to.

You don't see me worrying
about my job, do you?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.636
Unfortunately, no.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.957
That's because I have
a Stan, okay? He works.

I come here because it's
like a hobby that pays well.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.687

06:36.688 --> 06:40.550
to confirm that you and he were
still on for drinks with "Mark."

- Who's Mark?
- The guy I'm seeing.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.697
- Obviously, but which one?
- The only one.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.532

- The Hot Rabbi?

- And the Hot Rabbi's Cousin?
- Cut them loose.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.171
- You cleared the roster.
- I cleared the bench.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.674
Wow. You haven't dated just
one guy in a long time.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.453
It's not a big deal. It's very new.

07:08.553 --> 07:12.890
No jinxies. I get it. It's good
that Mark doesn't have a nickname.

07:12.891 --> 07:16.185
It means he's still viable.
You haven't rejected him.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.797
- He's not a donor kidney.
- It's not the organ I was thinking of.

- Wine.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.975
- Forget what?
- Dinner with Phil.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.243
You told me that was next week.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.013
No. I said it was next week last
week, which means it's this week.

not good. I gotta work.

meet you after your meeting?

I'll drive in to meet you in

No, you don't want to do that.

We'll go to that hot chocolate
place in the morning.

see you when I get back.

- Not too great.

I have to go handle it.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.922
Oh, no! You're going
to Connecticut now?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.591
I got to. There's two feet
of water in my basement.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.635
I can go with you. That'd be fun.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.263
No, you go see your dad.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.306
I'll see if he can
meet tomorrow night.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.543
I won't be back tomorrow night.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.671

08:43.273 --> 08:46.442

to take a rain check.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.651
Yeah, that's okay.

- Don't be mad.
- I'm not being anything.

- Go to Connecticut.

- Yeah, really.

09:17.348 --> 09:21.351
Uh, I couldn't read the menu because
I left my glasses at Nina's.

- Want to know who Nina is?
- Not really.

09:24.355 --> 09:27.816
Indian girl. Beautiful. Very soft
skin. We met at Trader Joe's.

- She told me about this naan bread.
- When did you start eating naan?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.990
She's 24, a dance major. I eat
anything she tells me to.

Where's your guy?

09:40.163 --> 09:43.582
- I think we just broke up.
- No! How come?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.502
A pipe burst in his house and
he went back to Connecticut.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.088
And where in the story
does he act like a jerk?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.240
- It's how he handled it.
- You're just being paranoid.

09:51.241 --> 09:53.258
No, I'm telling you something feels off.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.861

I'm usually always right.

and go surprise him.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.775

It must be big. You were crazy
about him two days ago.

13:16.212 --> 13:20.215
It can't be the sex... you were a lot
nicer and your hair was more shiny.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.785
He has a wife, okay? He's married.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.720
You don't think you can take her?

13:24.721 --> 13:27.306
That's not the point.
I don't do married guys.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.599
I don't need to wreck
someone's home for a date.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.810
It's not always a wreck. Stan
and I were married when we met.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.812
We weren't happy. Now we are.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.647
You wrecked two marriages!

13:35.648 --> 13:38.900
First, one was mine, so that
doesn't count. Second of all.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.320
Stan's wife was fat,
with no sexual charisma.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.239
That marriage was doomed,
so it wasn't cheating.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.074
I don't think that's how it works.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.328
But I think a married guy
is a perfect fit for you.

a whole other life

13:51.748 --> 13:53.665

13:53.666 --> 13:56.001
You need a guy with
something to keep him busy.

to see you... Kate King.

14:37.168 --> 14:40.337
Hi. I'm Kate. I met you on Friday.

14:40.338 --> 14:45.409
Yeah, I remember. Sorry about
your urn. What are you doing here?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.637
Um, I found your number
in my husband's phone.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.013
So, um...

14:50.014 --> 14:52.349
Well, actually, the phone bill,

14:52.350 --> 14:54.810
because I couldn't crack
the code on his password.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.688
Which is fitting, as obviously I don't
know anything going on in his life.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.525
But, anyhow, I'm here.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.860
I thought maybe we could talk?

15:03.861 --> 15:06.154
No, we can't. If you
have any questions

15:06.155 --> 15:08.766
about your husband,
you should ask him.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.035
Oh, well, I would,
but I'm pretty sure...

15:12.036 --> 15:15.773

with you. (CHUCKLES)

you would tell me I was crazy.

would be right at all.

Did you just start
sleeping together?

We were going to hold off for prom,
but we just got carried away.

We're adults. We had sex.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.615
The details don't matter.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.159
The details do matter, because...

17:16.160 --> 17:18.494
there's a difference
between having sex

17:18.496 --> 17:21.065
one time and having sex ten times.

Oh, my God! Did you do
it more than ten times?

him, while the bottom part of me...

he just put it in halfway...

we're going to find her.

51:25.233 --> 51:27.234
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

51:29.253 --> 51:33.073
And what do you plan on doing
if you find this girl?

51:33.090 --> 51:37.274
Don't come at me with all your...
weird little man logic, OK?

51:37.300 --> 51:42.607
This is a... one-day-at-a-time
operation. Today is light recon day.

51:42.683 --> 51:45.419
A grappling hook? Really?

51:46.770 --> 51:48.338
Damn.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.537
Look, I don't know if
you're here out of...

52:04.538 --> 52:06.247
morbid curiosity, or you and Kate

52:06.248 --> 52:08.191
are the weirdest friends ever...

52:08.208 --> 52:10.277
We are. The weirdest friends ever.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.128
But she's a good person.

52:12.129 --> 52:15.298
And though Mark's an asshole,
they had something real.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.216
And when she's done
running around with you,

52:17.217 --> 52:19.093
she'll realize that's gone.

52:19.094 --> 52:20.704
And it's going to suck.

52:20.971 --> 52:22.456
So...

52:22.640 --> 52:25.125
try not to make that
part any worse for her.

52:25.809 --> 52:27.461
Okay.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.548
KATE: Okay.

52:31.815 --> 52:33.300
They are on the move.

52:33.901 --> 52:35.469
KATE: Okay.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.304
Nothing.

52:39.573 --> 52:41.308
Okay.

52:42.576 --> 52:44.869
- He's up!
- CARLY: Really? What's he doing?

52:44.870 --> 52:46.313
- Kissing.
- Uh-huh.

52:48.082 --> 52:49.499
KATE: Probably tongue.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.901
CARLY: Mmm-hmm.

52:51.085 --> 52:53.044
KATE: Probably enjoying.

52:53.045 --> 52:54.253
CARLY: Great.

52:54.254 --> 52:58.091
KATE: Okay, target is moving!
Target is on the move.

52:58.092 --> 52:59.258
All right.

52:59.259 --> 53:03.471
Oh, he's wearing those cute shorts I got
him for Christmas. Those look good on him.

53:03.472 --> 53:04.722
Okay.

53:04.723 --> 53:06.599
I can't believe you're
not interested.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.309
Just promise when you meet her...

53:08.310 --> 53:11.938
you won't lose your shit like you
did with me. Don't say you didn't.

53:11.939 --> 53:16.275
I did, because I was a mistress-virgin
and you were the first.

53:16.276 --> 53:18.945
Now I'm all worn in
like an old glove.

53:18.946 --> 53:21.139
She's getting up!

53:21.532 --> 53:22.933
(GASPS)

53:23.784 --> 53:25.352
Oh, my God.

53:25.786 --> 53:27.687
- Holy shit!
- What?

53:28.080 --> 53:30.482
Oh, come on!

53:30.582 --> 53:32.083
What is that?

53:32.084 --> 53:34.335
Let me see. Let me see!

53:34.336 --> 53:36.587
Okay, but you're not
going to like it.

53:36.588 --> 53:37.989
Ah!

53:46.306 --> 53:48.766
She makes me look like
I'm wearing a diaper!

53:48.767 --> 53:50.643
You think she had that made?

53:50.644 --> 53:55.173
No. When you have a body like that,
everything fits you perfectly.

54:01.989 --> 54:06.768
This is just so unoriginal,
Mark! So cliché!

54:12.666 --> 54:15.042
She's the perfect ten lemon tart...

54:15.043 --> 54:16.169
Maybe an eleven.

54:16.170 --> 54:18.504
- double-D, natural double-D.
- A triple-D.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.381
CARLY: It's like a
midlife crisis mistress!

54:20.382 --> 54:23.634
She's like a cliché of every
wife's waking nightmare!

54:23.635 --> 54:26.512
You have to admit, that's
pretty good. Seriously.

54:26.513 --> 54:28.806
Okay, fine. She's beautiful.

54:28.807 --> 54:31.684
At some point you say...
I play tennis, right?

54:31.685 --> 54:35.188
But if I play against John
McEnroe, I expect to lose.

54:35.189 --> 54:36.814
- You know what?
- Right?

54:36.815 --> 54:38.592
I am McEnroe!

54:38.692 --> 54:41.027
What are you doing?!

54:41.028 --> 54:44.097
Where are you going?! Wait!

54:44.198 --> 54:45.932
No!

54:46.700 --> 54:49.436
Stop!

54:52.873 --> 54:55.609
What happened to being calm?!

55:05.052 --> 55:06.719
Carly!

55:06.720 --> 55:08.246
Carly!

55:08.722 --> 55:11.124
Stop!

55:23.403 --> 55:26.072
CARLY: I can't believe
he was cheating on me!

55:26.073 --> 55:28.533
KATE:
Oh, boo-hoo! He cheated on me, too!

55:28.534 --> 55:31.077
CARLY: You're the wife! He's
supposed to cheat on you!

55:31.078 --> 55:32.245
Oh, my God!

55:32.246 --> 55:34.413
Stop, you crazy housewife!

55:34.414 --> 55:38.652
Stop the grappling! I'm
strong when I'm mad!

55:40.254 --> 55:42.322
(BOTH SCREAMING)

55:43.715 --> 55:46.117
What's going on?

55:48.804 --> 55:50.664
(BOTH PANTING)

55:52.432 --> 55:54.000
BOTH: Hi.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.771
I just can't believe
he'd lie to me.

55:58.772 --> 56:01.341
I really thought we were soul mates.

56:01.608 --> 56:04.944
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I can't believe I said that.

56:04.945 --> 56:07.446
You're his soul mate. I'm a whore.

56:07.447 --> 56:11.617
You must hate me so much. If it's
any consolation, I hate me more.

56:11.618 --> 56:14.120
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you at all.

56:14.121 --> 56:16.747
I got all that out of my
system with that one.

56:16.748 --> 56:20.585
You're so amazing, to be friends
with your husband's mistress.

56:20.586 --> 56:23.296
Yeah, it's like a dream come true.

56:23.297 --> 56:27.091
Ignore her. She's working
through some stuff right now.

56:27.092 --> 56:31.470
She's kind of troubled. But you
smell amazing. What is that?

56:31.471 --> 56:33.331
I think it's just sweat.

56:33.974 --> 56:36.601
The worst part about this
is, you seem so nice...

56:36.602 --> 56:39.270
and he had me believing
you were the devil.

56:39.271 --> 56:40.479
Wait, what?

56:40.480 --> 56:43.425
He said you cheated on him,
then asked for a divorce.

56:43.650 --> 56:46.819
He said that... I was the cheater?

56:46.820 --> 56:49.614
That's what he said?
That I cheated?

56:49.615 --> 56:50.823
I'm so sorry.

56:50.824 --> 56:54.619
That is so... Okay. That's...
What an asshole!

56:54.620 --> 56:56.329
He's a liar, Kate.
Who cares what he says?

56:56.330 --> 56:58.331
Because it's not fair.

56:58.332 --> 57:00.833
He made me the bad guy.
And he's divorcing me?

57:00.834 --> 57:02.960
You know it's not actually
happening, right?

57:02.961 --> 57:05.463
He could pick any scenario,
and he picks that?

57:05.464 --> 57:06.964
And makes me the villain?

57:06.965 --> 57:09.634
And then divorces me
for fake-cheating?

57:09.635 --> 57:11.844
I shouldn't have told you.
I'm so sorry.

57:11.845 --> 57:14.472
It's not your fault I
married a monster.

57:14.473 --> 57:18.309
You are innocent in all this.
Let's go back to Phil's.

57:18.310 --> 57:19.518
Okay, let's go.

57:19.519 --> 57:21.854
Wait! What am I supposed to do?
You can't just leave me.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.315
Mark will be back any minute!

57:24.316 --> 57:25.983
- We'll get your number.
- Can we keep her?

57:25.984 --> 57:28.694
No, we can't keep her!
We have a dog at home!

57:28.695 --> 57:31.197
You pulled my hair,
which is totally...

57:31.198 --> 57:33.658
PHIL: Hey, hey, hey!

57:33.659 --> 57:35.368
Watch what I taught Thunder.

57:35.369 --> 57:36.895
Thunder, get me a beer.

57:38.664 --> 57:40.539
- KATE: Unbelievable.
- CARLY: Wow!

57:40.540 --> 57:42.166
- KATE: That's crazy.
- CARLY: It's a miracle.

57:42.167 --> 57:44.648
- KATE: That dog is trying to break me.
- CARLY: He really is.

57:45.545 --> 57:47.046
Good boy.

57:47.047 --> 57:49.282
So, how was the stalking?

57:49.341 --> 57:51.217
Thunder! Traitor.

57:51.218 --> 57:53.078
How'd it go, weirdo?

57:53.345 --> 57:57.348
It was good! We ran on the beach,
met Mark's new mistress...

57:57.349 --> 57:58.557
CARLY: Amber.

57:58.558 --> 57:59.850
Twenty-two, super hot.

57:59.851 --> 58:01.060
Are you jealous?

58:01.061 --> 58:03.896
No, I'm not jealous. I just don't
have an insane girl crush.

58:03.897 --> 58:05.648
I think it's good she's super hot.

58:05.649 --> 58:07.525
It brings up our group average.

58:07.526 --> 58:09.568
This isn't frickin' Sister Wives.

58:09.569 --> 58:11.237
You sure you're not angry?

58:11.238 --> 58:14.281
Letting it out is better than having to tell
the cops you didn't mean to hug her to death.

58:14.282 --> 58:15.366
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

58:15.367 --> 58:18.411
You're so funny! You'll
see when you meet her.

58:18.412 --> 58:20.980
- What? When I meet her?
- (LAUGHS)

58:22.582 --> 58:24.000
KATE: Up high.

58:24.001 --> 58:25.402
(LAUGHS)

58:26.044 --> 58:27.545
You look so pretty!

58:27.546 --> 58:28.963
AMBER: You look so pretty.

58:28.964 --> 58:30.381
CARLY: It's really annoying.

58:30.382 --> 58:31.991
PHIL: It's just bad.

58:33.093 --> 58:35.261
What's that up there?

58:35.262 --> 58:37.513
That's the best part of the house.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.999
You'll like it. Come on.
I'll show you.

58:40.892 --> 58:42.393
KATE: You're such a good girl.

58:42.394 --> 58:43.644
AMBER: Mark's an asshole!

58:43.645 --> 58:45.171
KATE: He is.

58:51.611 --> 58:53.346
Wow.

59:03.623 --> 59:06.359
I know exactly what
I would do with it.

59:08.462 --> 59:11.964
I would put a coffee
table right here...

59:11.965 --> 59:14.868
so I could have my morning coffee.

59:14.968 --> 59:18.637
You can't. There's too much
morning sun. It would blast you.

59:18.638 --> 59:22.876
No, this is where I would
want to exist, right here...

59:23.477 --> 59:25.211
looking at that.

59:25.312 --> 59:26.713
You sure?

59:27.314 --> 59:28.715
Yeah.

59:29.649 --> 59:31.442
I'll think about it.

59:31.443 --> 59:33.178
You better.

59:33.820 --> 59:35.388
Okay.

59:36.615 --> 59:39.142
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

59:49.461 --> 59:51.796
Kate might actually
have a point about

59:51.797 --> 59:54.365
her bringing up the group average.

59:55.801 --> 59:58.010
Do you care if I smoke?

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.346
No! I kind of want one, too.

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.680
Since when do you smoke?

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.641
Since whenever I want to.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.518
PHIL: This should be good.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.186
If we find any more mistresses,

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.088
I'll have to send her to rehab.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:32.946
(GROANS)

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.621
(SIGHS)

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.057
PHIL:
Don't worry, we didn't hook up.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.685
We didn't? Oh, thank God.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:50.296
You took off your clothes
to go skinny dipping.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.106
Really?

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.732
You girls started in
on the tequila...

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.802
and it all went
downhill from there.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:59.071
You wouldn't get dressed, so
I buttoned you in backwards.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:00.765
Shut up.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:04.451
So let me get this straight.
I came into your bed naked...

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:05.661
and tried to molest you,

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:09.915
so you made a straitjacket and a pillow
fort to protect yourself from me.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.442
Yeah.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.086
(SIGHS)
Oh, my God, I've hit rock bottom.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.655
Nah. Don't worry about it.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:18.007
We were pretty out of our heads,

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.326
and I like to think
I'm a good guy, so...

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.163
So you needed the
pillows to resist me.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:27.166
Let's say I was
hedging my willpower.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:31.671
I'm going to take a shower.

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:43.349
Good morning!

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:45.852
What are you guys doing?

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.788
Phil went for a run and
Amber's making frittatas.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:53.125
Have you packed? I want to get on
the road before traffic starts.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:56.362
No, 'cause then I have to
go home and deal with Mark.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.631
I was thinking, what sucks...

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:02.927
is that he should be the one freaking
out, not me. I didn't do anything.

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:06.931
Instead, he's totally fine and I'm
sitting here with the two of you...

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.974
pretending not to know you...

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:12.436
and on top of it, I have
to get my ducks in a row.

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:13.979
What do you want to do?

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.650
This may sound wrong, but I
kind of want him to hurt.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.610
I want to be the one...

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.612
who makes him start a new life

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:23.656
because I took it away from him.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:27.159
I want him to feel what
I feel, but worse.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.729
So you're talking about
maximum pain, right?

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:31.731
We should kick him in the balls!

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:35.084
That's like a really
good thought, and

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.461
I like the way your
brain works, but...

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:40.631
we're thinking about something
a little bigger than that.

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:42.633
It doesn't matter anyway.

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:45.886
He's always going to wind up on top
because he's a killer and I'm not.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.013
That's not true. You're not alone.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.682
- You have us.
- Exactly.

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.059
Put the Lawyer, the Wife
and the Boobs together...

I have a friend who could do it.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:55.680
No, no, no. We are not hiring a
hooker to sleep with my husband.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:57.682
She's not a hooker.
She's just a slut.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:14:00.644
Okay, we're done here.
I'm going to do it.

there... we could make it work.

01:17:58.299 --> 01:17:59.866

people in order to move forward.

forgiveness, did he?

01:39:26.878 --> 01:39:30.213
We thought you might say that.
Then Carly explained...

01:39:30.214 --> 01:39:32.424
a concept called restitution.

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:35.327
Think of it as payback. That's
how we framed it with Nick.

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:37.429
(INTERCOM BEEPING)
You framed it with Nick, now?

01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:40.765
You included Nick? Bullshit!
Now I know you're...

01:39:40.766 --> 01:39:44.837
Hey, Nick! Hey, man! I... What?

01:39:46.606 --> 01:39:48.940
I don't know what they told you.

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:51.568
They're having some kind
of group breakdown.

01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:54.179
They didn't tell me anything.
They showed me.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.283
It's over. I'm getting my ideas
direct from the factory now.

01:39:58.284 --> 01:40:03.079
What? From her?! Is this some
kind of joke? You're firing me?

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.083
Firing you is the least of it. The only
reason you're not going to prison...

01:40:07.084 --> 01:40:09.461
is because your wife
paid all the money back.

01:40:09.462 --> 01:40:12.631
Oh, no, no, no. You're all lying.

01:40:12.632 --> 01:40:17.260
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!
Global bullshit! I call bullshit!

01:40:17.261 --> 01:40:18.803
Bullshit!

01:40:18.804 --> 01:40:20.931
My wife's not some
criminal mastermind.

01:40:20.932 --> 01:40:25.169
She needs freakin' brain camp!
That's my money!

01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:26.587
(GRUNTS)

01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:28.396
(CHOKING)

01:40:28.397 --> 01:40:30.299
(GROANING)

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:36.655
Mark, you're not a
very nice person.

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:38.390
Shut up!

01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:41.435
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:44.063
- Get away. Get away, get away!
- (SCREAMS)

01:40:45.289 --> 01:40:46.540
That can't be right. It's a trick!

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:48.108
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:49.693
No!

01:40:51.003 --> 01:40:54.673
No, no, no, no!

01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:56.700
That's my money!

01:40:59.136 --> 01:41:03.207
You won't get away with this.
You won't get away with this!

01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:09.463
(GROANS)

01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:19.306
(GROWLING)

01:41:22.618 --> 01:41:24.019
(EXHALES)

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:30.375
Excuse me.

01:41:30.376 --> 01:41:32.319
(GLASS CRUNCHING)

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:46.349
Oh, oh, oh! Hey! Hey!
Hey, buddy! I'm here! Stop!

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:49.352
- It's already hooked.
- Come on. It's barely in the red!

01:41:49.353 --> 01:41:51.088
It's already in the air, guy.

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:55.092
- That's a $300,000 car, asshole!
- I guess you can afford it, then.

01:41:55.901 --> 01:41:57.360
Welcome to New York.

01:41:57.361 --> 01:41:59.596
You get back here!

01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:03.908
See?! This! This!

01:42:03.909 --> 01:42:06.478
- You mother...
- (HORN HONKING)

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.774
(SCREAMING)

01:42:12.043 --> 01:42:15.988
Huh, could this day get
any worse? Really?!

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:17.948
What?

01:42:21.886 --> 01:42:24.288
Next time, call a plumber.

01:42:29.727 --> 01:42:31.962
There she is!

01:42:38.235 --> 01:42:40.612
- What a cute dress!
- Thank you!

01:42:40.613 --> 01:42:42.014
(SIGHS)

01:42:42.073 --> 01:42:43.448
Hi.

01:42:43.449 --> 01:42:45.350
CARLY: Can I make a toast?

01:42:46.285 --> 01:42:48.687
Here's to having friends...

01:42:49.288 --> 01:42:52.457
friends that love
every part of you.

01:42:52.458 --> 01:42:55.627
And though it brought us together, let's
never sleep with the same guy again.

01:42:55.628 --> 01:42:57.654
- CARLY: Good idea. Never.
- Ever.

01:42:57.922 --> 01:42:59.656
- Cheers.
- Love you guys.
