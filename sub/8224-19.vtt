...as the MythBusters'
top 12 most precious places...

Here comes chaos.

00:22.003 --> 00:24.136
Narrator:
Why are we banned from a quarry?

00:25.473 --> 00:27.474
And that's why we can
never go to Esparto again.

What really happened at the White House?

00:30.179 --> 00:32.351

actually got a little choked up.

00:32.353 --> 00:36.223
Narrator: And what keeps all
five MythBusters awake at night?

00:36.225 --> 00:38.257
After dark, it's pretty scary.

So, pack your shades, your thermals...

is going to be quite a journey.

01:53.298 --> 01:55.032
the dozen best "mythbuster" locations.

Whoa!

02:06.047 --> 02:07.981

Narrator: Because over the years...

02:09.518 --> 02:10.817
Ohh!

02:10.818 --> 02:13.486
...these little shops
have seen a lot of horrors.

02:14.856 --> 02:17.890
But as to why they make
this location countdown...

02:18.792 --> 02:20.092
here's the landlord.

02:20.094 --> 02:21.727
He's a trouper, man, I'll tell you.

02:21.729 --> 02:24.697
Nowadays, M5 is pretty well
dominated by "MythBusters."

about 15 years or so ago...

02:31.472 --> 02:33.638
This is M5, my special-effects shop.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.440
...it was where a director could go,

02:35.442 --> 02:37.808
and pretty much
anything he could dream up,

we could make it.

Jamie's built entire special-effects sets

02:41.414 --> 02:42.747
out of lard.

02:42.749 --> 02:44.516
Why is it called M5?

02:44.518 --> 02:46.618
Jamie had a contest among his employees

02:46.620 --> 02:48.554
over what the name
of that studio should be.

02:48.556 --> 02:51.090
I said, "you should call it M5,"
because I was thinking

02:51.092 --> 02:53.359
that was the name
of the British secret service,

02:53.361 --> 02:55.661
which I didn't realize was MI6.

02:55.663 --> 02:58.298
It's Hyneman, James Hyneman.

[ Gunshot ]

He's never formally credited me
with coming up with the name,

even though it's the wrong name,

03:04.941 --> 03:07.675

to boldly go where
no scientist has gone before.

03:22.293 --> 03:23.592
Are they getting bigger?

My breasts are expanding.

03:26.063 --> 03:28.029

Narrator: But as time went by,

03:29.833 --> 03:32.900
with more myths came more mess...

Don't tell Jamie, okay?
This is a secret between us.

03:36.673 --> 03:39.173

03:39.175 --> 03:41.575
Oh, this is bad.

03:41.577 --> 03:44.412
The thing is, M5 is my shop. I own it.

03:44.414 --> 03:46.280
But "MythBusters"?

03:46.282 --> 03:49.784
Well, let's just say they're not
really very good tenants.

I swear I think I can smell it
through the concrete. [ Insects buzzing ]

And so halfway through season two,

through the wall.

was one of our all-time biggest explosions.

And they got it back to the edit suite,

06:34.819 --> 06:37.353

looked at it, and they thought,

"eh, it's missing something.
It's missing a big finale."

So, we had to find a location big enough

to completely decimate this truck,

and then that's when one of our
producers found the rock quarry

separating us from the explosion

19:37.402 --> 19:39.201
...the experiment worked like a charm.

19:41.938 --> 19:46.441
And the myth, like Buster, was busted.

19:46.443 --> 19:47.743
This is more damage

19:47.745 --> 19:49.211
than we've ever done to Buster
in one myth before.

19:49.213 --> 19:50.445
The "elevator of death" story

19:50.447 --> 19:52.314
is one of the earliest abandoned locations

- Whoo!

19:57.822 --> 19:59.556
Man, that was intense.

19:59.558 --> 20:01.758
We got the ability to take that elevator

20:03.529 --> 20:06.396
in a building slated
to be completely destroyed.

20:06.398 --> 20:09.032
I think Buster feels good
about a job well done,

20:09.034 --> 20:11.701
and he just hopes that we don't
put his head on backwards.

20:11.703 --> 20:13.936
It gave us a tremendous amount of freedom

20:13.938 --> 20:15.637
to test this myth

at a scale I don't think anyone
else has ever tested it at.

20:23.647 --> 20:25.813
Now, one of the great things
about "MythBusters"

is we get access
to some incredible university

- Cool.

38:14.835 --> 38:16.936
is that there's a very, very good reason

38:16.938 --> 38:19.304
that we use the Alameda County
Sheriff's bomb range,

38:19.306 --> 38:22.775
and that is that a lot of
the stuff that we need to do

38:22.777 --> 38:26.812
would normally be just flat-out illegal.

38:26.814 --> 38:29.248
So, we figured it'd be a good idea

38:29.250 --> 38:32.251
to just do it there
with all the cops watching.

38:34.621 --> 38:36.021
Then it's okay.

38:36.023 --> 38:37.956
Narrator:
And it's two cops in particular,

38:37.958 --> 38:40.291
Frank Doyle and J.D. Nelson...

38:40.293 --> 38:43.828
that really put the "bomb" in bomb range.

38:45.265 --> 38:46.598
Adam: The chief bomb tech

38:46.600 --> 38:48.267
at the Alameda County
Sheriff's Bomb Disposal Range

38:48.269 --> 38:50.769
is sergeant J.D. Nelson.

38:50.771 --> 38:52.104
I'll tell you what...

38:52.106 --> 38:54.107
if I have a problem,
I'd take it to J.D. Nelson.

38:54.109 --> 38:55.709
I know he'll make it disappear.

38:55.711 --> 38:57.678
Kari: In 3, 2, 1...

38:57.680 --> 38:58.679
go, J.D.!

39:00.248 --> 39:04.118
Jamie: He's very professional,
but he's just totally relaxed,

39:04.120 --> 39:06.754
and when you're working with explosives,

39:06.756 --> 39:08.289
relaxed is a good thing.

39:08.291 --> 39:09.657
On the record, I'm just gonna say

39:09.659 --> 39:13.294
I'm totally against this burning
of wine and champagne.

39:15.897 --> 39:18.032
Adam: Who is Frank Doyle?

39:18.034 --> 39:21.336
I can tell you he's
a retired FBI special agent.

39:21.338 --> 39:24.038
I can tell you that he led the task force

39:24.040 --> 39:25.907
that stormed the unabomber's shack.

39:25.909 --> 39:27.708
But, really,

39:27.710 --> 39:30.777
I feel like at some point in my
life when I'm in real trouble,

39:30.779 --> 39:33.813
having his phone number
is gonna help me out.

39:33.815 --> 39:36.983
In the vicinity of five minutes,
his pants should be in New York.

39:39.486 --> 39:41.353
Narrator:
But despite our bomb techs' specs,

39:41.355 --> 39:44.789
there is a behind-the-scenes situation

39:44.791 --> 39:46.257
that they can't help with.

39:46.259 --> 39:50.795
Adam: There is one complicated
limitation to the bomb range,

39:50.797 --> 39:53.832
which is that the land of the bomb range

39:53.834 --> 39:57.769
has been blown up and carved up
and dug up for so many years,

39:57.771 --> 40:01.305
there is nothing approaching
topsoil in the whole area.

40:01.307 --> 40:03.841
It is all clay.

40:03.843 --> 40:05.676
It's the Swedish mud dance.

40:05.678 --> 40:07.512
[ Imitates traditional Swedish song ]

40:07.514 --> 40:09.981
So, when it rains at the bomb range,

40:09.983 --> 40:11.849
you're gonna ruin your shoes.

40:11.851 --> 40:12.984
It's horrific.

40:12.986 --> 40:14.285
- Are you all right?
- Oh, no!

40:14.287 --> 40:16.287
Adam: It makes working there

40:16.289 --> 40:18.356
really, really, really difficult.

40:18.358 --> 40:20.525
And then it makes it all worth it

40:20.527 --> 40:22.894
when you get to watch the
high-speed of things blowing up.

40:22.896 --> 40:24.997
Narrator: And speaking of explosions

40:24.999 --> 40:27.332
on high-def high speed,

40:27.334 --> 40:29.568
the fan-favorite moment at the bomb range

40:29.570 --> 40:33.271
was the supersized sawdust cannon,

40:33.273 --> 40:37.208
where things didn't quite go to plan.

40:37.210 --> 40:39.677
So, we said, "okay, this is MythBusters."

40:39.679 --> 40:40.811
"Let's ramp it up."

40:40.813 --> 40:43.414
"What's more flammable than sawdust?"

40:43.416 --> 40:44.515
"Coffee creamer."

40:44.517 --> 40:48.986
Non-dairy creamer cannon in 3, 2, 1...

40:48.988 --> 40:51.855
I don't think we quite expected
the results we got,

40:51.857 --> 40:54.858
because we were standing awfully close

40:54.860 --> 41:00.531
to what turned into
a giant, growling ball of fire

41:00.533 --> 41:03.701
that started to come towards us,

41:03.703 --> 41:07.271
dripping napalm of burning sugar.

41:07.273 --> 41:11.442
Tory: It was like armageddon,
and everybody took off running.

41:13.011 --> 41:15.613
Oh, my God!

41:15.615 --> 41:17.114
That was frightening!

41:17.116 --> 41:20.450
It was one of those moments
where it was like, "oh, crap."

41:21.953 --> 41:24.888
Narrator:
But it's exactly that type of chaos,

41:24.890 --> 41:28.492
coupled with the diversity
of myth mayhem...

41:28.494 --> 41:29.527
Whoa!

41:29.529 --> 41:31.195
Narrator: ...that makes the bomb range

41:31.197 --> 41:33.631
the MythBusters' most-loved location.

41:33.633 --> 41:35.900
Man: Are you gonna paint
your house with explosives?

41:35.902 --> 41:38.303
So, while the credits roll,

41:38.305 --> 41:42.206
here's our tribute to
the team's home away from home.

41:45.235 --> 41:55.235

42:05.061 --> 42:06.595
That was perfect.
