WEBVTT

00:10.962 --> 00:13.332
Something happened to these people.

00:13.334 --> 00:15.646
Something quick, something fast.

00:15.648 --> 00:18.107
Somebody grabbed my ankles

00:18.109 --> 00:19.579
and dragged me out the bottom of the bed.

00:19.581 --> 00:21.225
Somebody's physical here.

00:21.227 --> 00:23.593
You just can't rest in this house.

00:23.595 --> 00:28.134
Most of the problem is upstairs.

00:28.136 --> 00:30.287
We're gonna try to fix this, okay?

00:30.289 --> 00:33.476
This place is bad. Bad.

00:33.478 --> 00:37.253
Yeah,
there's a lot of crazy [bleep] going on.

00:37.255 --> 00:39.940
Something bad's going to happen.

00:39.942 --> 00:42.463
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.465 --> 00:43.698
There's panic.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.539
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:45.541 --> 00:46.743
I see dead people.

00:46.745 --> 00:48.885
They all died horribly.

00:48.887 --> 00:50.633
I speak to dead people.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.006
Get out of here.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.649
And they speak to me.

00:53.651 --> 00:55.758
Vicious.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.847
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.849 --> 01:00.329
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

01:00.429 --> 01:01.630
I rely on my partner.

01:01.632 --> 01:03.169
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.171 --> 01:05.543
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.545 --> 01:07.715
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:07.717 --> 01:10.922
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.924 --> 01:12.428
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:12.430 --> 01:13.596
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.598 --> 01:15.096
This is not good.

01:15.098 --> 01:17.609
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.611 --> 01:19.649
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.651 --> 01:21.016
Until the very end...

01:21.018 --> 01:22.822
I want my life back.

01:22.824 --> 01:25.095
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:25.097 --> 01:26.903
Is he trying to kill her?

01:26.905 --> 01:28.176
Or time to get out.

01:28.178 --> 01:29.345
Oh, my God.

01:29.347 --> 01:31.249
This is going to kill us.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:45.390 --> 01:48.527
I'm out here in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

01:48.529 --> 01:51.436
Amy and I got called in
by a woman named Lisa.

01:51.438 --> 01:55.041
Now, this is a hardworking,
salt-of-the-earth, sweet woman.

01:55.043 --> 01:57.509
She's also scared out of her mind.

01:59.379 --> 02:01.413
Told me the activity in her house

02:01.415 --> 02:03.417
is so violent and out of control,

02:03.419 --> 02:05.153
she's barely getting any sleep.

02:05.155 --> 02:09.092
And now whatever's in the house
is attacking her grandchildren,

02:09.094 --> 02:11.569
and that's where she draws the line.

02:11.571 --> 02:14.942
She says we're her last hope and
she's praying that we can help.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.990
Before Amy arrives,

02:19.992 --> 02:22.594
I clear the house of
any leading information.

02:24.063 --> 02:27.736
Family photos and personal items
can influence her findings,

02:27.738 --> 02:29.437
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

02:31.908 --> 02:35.080
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:47.831 --> 02:51.704
There's a lot of people...
dead people...

02:51.706 --> 02:55.940
and they're cognizant, conscious entities.

02:55.942 --> 03:00.713
They seem agitated when
I try to talk to them.

03:03.718 --> 03:05.953
This one guy wears, like, a bowler hat.

03:05.955 --> 03:07.390
He kind of is a troublemaker.

03:07.392 --> 03:09.762
He's an instigator for
the dead and the living.

03:15.835 --> 03:17.771
Lisa, I'm glad to be here.

03:17.773 --> 03:19.910
You sounded really upset on the phone.

03:19.912 --> 03:22.445
Now that I'm here,
tell me what the hell's going on.

03:22.447 --> 03:24.715
I'm being attacked,

03:24.717 --> 03:26.821
my granddaughter's being attacked,

03:26.823 --> 03:29.392
and my daughter is being attacked, as well.

03:29.394 --> 03:31.294
I know something's here,

03:31.296 --> 03:33.532
and we need your help,
and that's why I called.

03:33.534 --> 03:35.535
What kind of things are we talking about?

03:35.537 --> 03:38.005
We're hearing walking,

03:38.007 --> 03:42.113
doors slamming upstairs,
opening and closing constantly,

03:42.115 --> 03:44.048
and I'm being touched.

03:44.050 --> 03:47.888
Our household is being turned upside down,

03:47.890 --> 03:51.925
and, you know,
my kids don't even want to come in here.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.762
When they do visit,
they don't want to stay long.

03:53.764 --> 03:55.196
Okay, so, let me ask you a question.

03:55.198 --> 03:56.830
When you moved here,
was there somebody else living here?

03:56.832 --> 03:59.701
When we first moved here,
it was an empty lot,

03:59.703 --> 04:02.006
and they just built the homes in 2006.

04:02.008 --> 04:05.041
That changes my investigation a lot.

04:05.043 --> 04:06.807
Who exactly is living here with you?

04:06.809 --> 04:10.945
My daughter Tamiera and
my granddaughter Kayla

04:10.947 --> 04:13.046
and my ex-husband.

04:14.547 --> 04:15.714
- Your ex-husband?
- Yes.

04:15.716 --> 04:17.149
Are you guys in the same bed?

04:17.152 --> 04:19.983
No. He sleeps in the spare room,

04:19.986 --> 04:23.690
and lately,
he started sleeping on the couch.

04:23.692 --> 04:27.461
We've spoken to him about it to
ask him if he's seen anything,

04:27.463 --> 04:31.097
and he just says, you know,
"I don't want to talk about it."

04:31.099 --> 04:33.365
All we do is argue.

04:33.367 --> 04:37.004
I truly believe it's the house
that's causing all of this.

04:37.006 --> 04:38.972
Now, Lisa, a lot of couples break up.

04:38.974 --> 04:40.637
What makes you think it's paranormal?

04:40.639 --> 04:43.641
Well, we've been together for 36 years,

04:43.643 --> 04:45.978
and his attitude that he has now,

04:45.980 --> 04:49.578
since we moved in this house,
has changed dramatically.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.376
What are you hoping we could do for you?

04:53.378 --> 04:56.211
Help me find out what's
going on in this house

04:56.213 --> 04:58.410
so we can have some peace of mind

04:58.412 --> 05:01.344
and be able to sleep in here.

05:01.346 --> 05:03.679
I just want my family back.

05:08.883 --> 05:13.187
Mm. There's panic... stress, panic, panic.

05:13.189 --> 05:15.588
Bad. Bad.

05:16.956 --> 05:21.425
These people who live here are very open,

05:21.427 --> 05:26.860
and they are being extremely
influenced by the dead,

05:26.862 --> 05:30.131
which instigator guy loves

05:30.133 --> 05:34.032
because he can do whatever
the [bleep] he wants.

05:37.001 --> 05:44.342
There's, uh... a woman,
maybe more, screaming upstairs.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.912
They're freaking out.

05:45.914 --> 05:50.015
And the other person in the
house is in [bleep] denial.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.553
This instigator guy

05:54.555 --> 05:58.494
is very focused on this
person who is in denial.

05:58.496 --> 06:01.565
He [bleep] them all the [bleep] time,

06:01.567 --> 06:05.003
and the person who is in denial knows this.

06:05.005 --> 06:06.438
But it's real nasty.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.308
Okay, so, what's going on in here?

06:13.310 --> 06:17.943
We hear the refrigerator
opening and closing constantly,

06:17.945 --> 06:19.777
and no one's in here.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.446
Okay, so...

06:21.448 --> 06:22.981
Like that?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.317
Just like that.

06:24.319 --> 06:26.417
Now, I've seen a dog actually
open and close a refrigerator.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.487
- You got animals?
- We don't have any animals.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.922
- Okay, so, you got no animals in the house.
- None.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.924
What about your ex-husband? Did he hear it?

06:32.926 --> 06:36.229
Yes, he's heard it,
and I'll say, "Did you hear it?"

06:36.231 --> 06:39.536
"Yeah. It could be the wind,
or it could be," you know...

06:39.538 --> 06:41.237
Okay, so he's just being a stubborn man.

06:41.239 --> 06:42.770
Yes, exactly. Yes.

06:42.772 --> 06:44.338
Would he talk to me?

06:44.340 --> 06:45.340
He says no.

06:45.342 --> 06:47.342
He's adamant about that.

06:47.344 --> 06:49.044
He just will refuse.

06:49.046 --> 06:50.445
Okay.

06:54.919 --> 06:58.925
There's, like,
a lot of stuff going on up here.

07:00.559 --> 07:02.160
Instigator guy can do a lot.

07:02.162 --> 07:04.830
He can open and close doors,

07:04.832 --> 07:07.565
and I think living people,
if they're kind of sensitive,

07:07.567 --> 07:09.398
would kind of feel this,

07:09.400 --> 07:12.470
and they're like, "Aah! That's freaky."

07:14.908 --> 07:16.442
He thinks it's funny.

07:16.444 --> 07:18.912
But it's something really evil.

07:24.354 --> 07:26.787
So, why'd you bring me into this room?

07:26.789 --> 07:30.726
I've seen an old lady in the closet,

07:30.728 --> 07:32.026
in my closet right there.

07:32.028 --> 07:34.830
She looked to be in her 80s.

07:34.832 --> 07:36.098
She had gray in her hair,

07:36.100 --> 07:38.599
and her hair looked like it was curly.

07:38.601 --> 07:40.068
She had almost like a witch nose.

07:40.070 --> 07:42.104
- Long?
- It was long. Yeah.

07:42.106 --> 07:43.672
And she kind of looked sinister.

07:43.674 --> 07:45.206
How the hell do you go to sleep

07:45.208 --> 07:46.312
knowing there's a head in your closet?

07:46.412 --> 07:48.146
I take sleeping pills to
help me sleep at night.

07:48.148 --> 07:50.213
Are you sure that the stuff you're taking

07:50.215 --> 07:51.313
is not giving you...?

07:51.315 --> 07:53.416
I know without a doubt it's not those.

07:53.418 --> 07:55.086
I don't know how you're
even dealing with that,

07:55.088 --> 07:56.387
but what else is going on in here?

07:56.389 --> 08:00.153
I, um,
was on my back in the middle of the bed,

08:00.155 --> 08:03.359
and I was being touched.

08:03.361 --> 08:04.760
Um...

08:04.762 --> 08:07.398
My breasts were being touched,

08:07.400 --> 08:12.137
and I saw this shadow figure get off of me.

08:12.139 --> 08:13.638
I looked to my left,

08:13.640 --> 08:16.978
and I saw this gentleman
standing to the left,

08:16.980 --> 08:20.147
facing the window, and he was well-dressed,

08:20.149 --> 08:23.485
and he smiled at me,
and I just lost it, Steve.

08:23.487 --> 08:26.054
I just started cursing him.

08:26.056 --> 08:28.523
Then he just disappeared after that.

08:28.525 --> 08:30.494
I know it's hard to talk about. It is.

08:30.496 --> 08:32.864
It's really hard to sleep
in this room at night.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.798
It's really hard to be in this house.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.298
- You weren't just touched.
- Yeah.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.068
You were physically assaulted sexually.

08:38.070 --> 08:41.106
Just can't rest...
We can't rest in this house.

08:41.107 --> 08:42.405
You've got to be going out of your mind

08:42.408 --> 08:43.573
thinking about your granddaughter

08:43.575 --> 08:45.476
and your daughter being here, as well.

08:45.478 --> 08:47.146
Yes. And that's my biggest worry.

08:47.148 --> 08:49.483
Are you afraid that maybe
something's happening with them?

08:49.485 --> 08:51.955
Something already has.

08:58.426 --> 09:01.363
This person's not [bleep] sleeping.

09:01.365 --> 09:04.468
The living person's afraid of this dead guy,

09:04.470 --> 09:07.737
and the instigator,
he really comes on full force.

09:07.739 --> 09:09.807
He does creepy stuff sometimes, you know.

09:09.809 --> 09:11.642
Explain that more. What do you mean?

09:11.644 --> 09:16.480
One thing I see is, like,
a shadow going up the wall,

09:16.482 --> 09:19.651
going up the ceiling.

09:22.922 --> 09:26.291
He's done things like go onto the bed.

09:26.293 --> 09:28.024
I see grabbing.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.757
Not a good area.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.820
So, Tamiera, I was talking to Mom

09:55.822 --> 09:57.391
about the activity in the house.

09:57.393 --> 09:58.053
Mm-hmm.

09:58.153 --> 10:01.121
Now, you live here with your
8- year-old daughter, Makayla.

10:01.123 --> 10:02.455
- Makayla, yes.
- Okay.

10:02.457 --> 10:04.555
- And she's autistic?
- She's autistic.

10:04.557 --> 10:06.189
Okay.

10:06.191 --> 10:08.360
Here's a picture of her.

10:08.362 --> 10:09.495
- This is her?
- This is her.

10:09.497 --> 10:11.829
- Oh, she's cute.
- Thank you.

10:11.831 --> 10:14.265
She won't sleep nowhere else.

10:14.267 --> 10:16.237
Okay, so, she stays in bed with you?

10:16.239 --> 10:18.273
- All the time, yeah.
- What about you?

10:18.275 --> 10:20.372
Any experiences that you can share with me?

10:20.374 --> 10:23.242
Yeah. I seen an old lady.

10:23.244 --> 10:25.212
Okay, your mom mentioned an old lady.

10:25.214 --> 10:26.479
Which one are you seeing?

10:26.481 --> 10:29.116
She's hunched over.
She got salt-and-pepper hair.

10:29.118 --> 10:30.718
Okay.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.457
She's very, like, in her 80s-looking.

10:33.459 --> 10:35.891
- She got wrinkles.
- Okay.

10:35.893 --> 10:38.391
So, when you see her,
does she recog... Does she see you?

10:38.393 --> 10:39.525
Yeah. And what does she do?

10:39.527 --> 10:42.061
I feel like somebody's stroking my hair.

10:42.063 --> 10:44.262
Okay, is it, like, a gentle touch, though?

10:44.264 --> 10:47.064
Yeah, like a motherly love touch.

10:47.066 --> 10:49.735
But then, when I roll over
to see if it's my daughter,

10:49.737 --> 10:54.942
she will have her back towards me,
facing this way.

10:54.944 --> 10:57.045
- So it's not her.
- So it's not her.

10:59.815 --> 11:04.087
There are a couple of dead people

11:04.089 --> 11:07.089
that are hanging around

11:07.091 --> 11:11.195
because these people are
so easy to be influenced.

11:11.197 --> 11:13.097
I think it's a female.

11:13.099 --> 11:18.198
The only thing I can see in her
aging is her hair turns white.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.566
Kind of a witchy look,

11:20.568 --> 11:23.371
like her nose and chin
kind of witchy-looking.

11:23.373 --> 11:26.976
Do you know if the living would
have any interactions with her?

11:26.978 --> 11:30.480
Yes, I do believe they would.

11:31.648 --> 11:33.315
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.152
Ow!

11:35.154 --> 11:37.189
Mm!

11:37.191 --> 11:38.457
What happened?

11:38.459 --> 11:40.058
I got pinched.

11:40.060 --> 11:44.063
The older woman is being
physical to a living male here.

11:44.065 --> 11:47.868
She won't leave him alone, really.

11:47.870 --> 11:52.476
She's always, like,
pinching, prodding, poking.

11:52.478 --> 11:57.014
She doesn't like him at all.
Like, he feels stalked.

11:57.016 --> 12:03.688
She feels like she's
protecting a living female

12:03.690 --> 12:05.490
from this living male.

12:05.492 --> 12:09.958
I think dead lady feels like
this dude shouldn't be here

12:09.960 --> 12:12.927
'cause he's no good for this living lady.

12:12.929 --> 12:16.898
Yeah, she hates him a lot.

12:19.707 --> 12:22.510
Let me ask you another question.
I was talking to Mom.

12:22.512 --> 12:24.911
She's had some physical
things happen to her.

12:24.913 --> 12:26.412
Yeah.

12:26.414 --> 12:27.780
What about you?

12:27.782 --> 12:29.949
I was in bed asleep.

12:29.951 --> 12:32.118
My daughter wasn't home at the time.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.289
She was with her dad, and, um...

12:35.291 --> 12:37.761
I felt like somebody grabbed my ankles

12:37.763 --> 12:39.728
and dragged me out the bottom of the bed,

12:39.730 --> 12:41.396
and I hit this right here.

12:41.398 --> 12:42.563
Okay.

12:42.565 --> 12:43.798
Look.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.500
You okay?

12:45.502 --> 12:47.970
Oh, honey. All right.

12:47.972 --> 12:50.904
Okay. You all right?

12:55.980 --> 12:58.382
I
hate talking about that.

12:59.952 --> 13:01.888
You okay?

13:05.090 --> 13:07.191
I'm right here with you.

13:07.193 --> 13:08.859
Nothing's gonna happen while I'm here, okay?

13:08.861 --> 13:10.226
Okay.

13:10.228 --> 13:12.529
My heart's beating fast.

13:12.531 --> 13:14.264
I feel like... I don't know.

13:14.266 --> 13:16.500
I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes

13:16.502 --> 13:18.839
dealing with this, you know?

13:18.841 --> 13:21.275
Like, why is it happening to me?

13:21.277 --> 13:22.874
That's how you feel. Like...

13:22.876 --> 13:24.208
Right.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.476
How often is this physical
stuff happening to you?

13:32.618 --> 13:34.517
I'm seeing another dead person,

13:34.519 --> 13:36.883
and he's very distinguished-looking.

13:36.885 --> 13:41.552
He comes in here because, um, he wants help,

13:41.554 --> 13:43.921
and he wants to leave.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.291
He does feel trapped here.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.625
Why does he come here?

13:47.627 --> 13:50.999
'Cause I think one of
the person has abilities.

13:51.001 --> 13:53.870
He's inducing [bleep] panic attacks

13:53.872 --> 13:56.838
because he's super-forceful at night

13:56.840 --> 14:00.174
'cause that's when he
can get to this person.

14:00.176 --> 14:04.912
I think that they do see him,
um, and I think they hear him,

14:04.914 --> 14:08.715
and, you know,
I do see him getting physical.

14:10.921 --> 14:13.954
And I think this person, like, sees him,

14:13.956 --> 14:17.156
like, you know, shaking the bed.

14:17.158 --> 14:20.630
Instigator guy wants to be friends
with this distinguished guy,

14:20.632 --> 14:22.299
you know, and the other guy's like,
"Would you just leave

14:22.301 --> 14:24.132
because I want to [bleep] leave," you know.

14:24.134 --> 14:28.336
Even though, at times,
I think they've seen both,

14:28.338 --> 14:29.705
like, at once.

14:29.707 --> 14:34.475
So, yeah,
there's a lot of crazy [bleep] going on.

14:37.149 --> 14:39.917
How are you dealing with this?

14:39.919 --> 14:42.287
I'm trying to deal with it,

14:42.289 --> 14:45.226
and I think the reason why
I haven't given up and left

14:45.228 --> 14:46.694
is because of my mom.

14:46.696 --> 14:48.562
I don't want to leave her here by herself.

14:48.564 --> 14:49.962
Okay.

14:49.964 --> 14:55.499
You know, and at the same time,
I'm worried about my little girl

14:55.501 --> 14:57.567
'cause, you know, she see things, too.

14:57.569 --> 14:59.768
She screams out, "Monster."

15:01.404 --> 15:03.172
I don't know what else to do.

15:03.174 --> 15:07.076
Like, I'm so afraid of being
in this house at nighttime

15:07.078 --> 15:09.077
or even in the daytime.

15:09.079 --> 15:10.612
You mean alone?

15:10.614 --> 15:11.881
Yeah.

15:11.883 --> 15:16.487
Like, I'll sit in the car when people leave
'cause I...

15:19.294 --> 15:21.029
Aww, honey. Come here.

15:21.031 --> 15:23.397
It's okay.

15:26.704 --> 15:28.137
You know what? We're gonna try to fix this

15:28.139 --> 15:29.839
so you don't have to sit
in your car no more, okay?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.408
Okay.

15:31.410 --> 15:33.845
It's frustrating, too,

15:33.847 --> 15:36.812
because I don't want it
to mess with my daughter.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.038
The second I get to a new location,

15:56.040 --> 15:57.307
I start making a bunch of calls.

15:57.309 --> 15:59.275
I reach out to cops and historians

15:59.277 --> 16:00.777
to help me out with my case.

16:00.779 --> 16:03.380
So, I just got a call
back from a genealogist

16:03.382 --> 16:06.252
who says one of the first
owners of Lisa's property

16:06.254 --> 16:09.115
has a story I'm definitely
gonna want to know about.

16:16.284 --> 16:18.218
Elissa, you mentioned this guy Edward Cappe

16:18.220 --> 16:19.320
had a tough go of things

16:19.322 --> 16:20.952
when he lived on my client's property

16:20.954 --> 16:22.552
in a house that's no longer there.

16:22.554 --> 16:25.322
Edward was born in 1843 in Ohio

16:25.324 --> 16:27.292
and came with his family to Pittsburgh.

16:27.294 --> 16:29.895
And then he joined his father
in the printing business.

16:29.897 --> 16:34.303
Then he met Sadie,
the love of his life, and marries her.

16:34.305 --> 16:36.606
And they move on to the
property you're investigating

16:36.608 --> 16:38.776
in about 1872.

16:38.778 --> 16:40.912
You mentioned on the phone
there was a lot of tragedy

16:40.914 --> 16:42.547
involving Edward Cappe and his family.

16:42.549 --> 16:44.216
What did you mean?

16:44.218 --> 16:46.816
He had lost four out of his
seven children and his wife.

16:46.818 --> 16:53.061
His second-born daughter, Ida,
died in 1875 of scarlet fever.

16:53.063 --> 16:56.330
This is Ida's death record.

16:56.332 --> 17:00.603
Then we have Harry,
who dies at age 9 months.

17:00.605 --> 17:06.007
And he dies of summer complaint,
which is a colloquial term

17:06.009 --> 17:09.575
for salmonella contamination
through breast milk.

17:09.577 --> 17:11.108
And then, nine years later,

17:11.111 --> 17:15.011
Dalton is born but dies at 5 weeks old.

17:15.012 --> 17:17.147
And he dies of malnutrition.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.519
How did Sadie take all this?

17:19.521 --> 17:21.553
I don't think she took it very well.

17:21.555 --> 17:25.021
She was only 41 when she
passed of uterine cancer.

17:25.023 --> 17:30.227
This is Sadie's death certificate from 1893.

17:30.229 --> 17:32.794
- She also died on the property?
- Yes.

17:32.796 --> 17:35.864
So, then, his namesake, Edward Jr.,

17:35.866 --> 17:40.569
dies in 1920 as a young man
due to a blood disorder.

17:40.571 --> 17:42.203
Oh, geez.

17:42.205 --> 17:44.170
So, Elissa, at this point,
this guy's been through a lot.

17:44.172 --> 17:45.205
What happens to him?

17:45.207 --> 17:49.110
He dies in 1922 of stomach cancer.

17:49.112 --> 17:51.213
I found his will,

17:51.215 --> 17:52.783
and there's something very interesting.

17:52.785 --> 17:55.616
The estate owed $707,

17:55.618 --> 17:59.689
so he dies broke, dependent on his children.

17:59.691 --> 18:02.025
You weren't kidding about a tragedy.

18:02.027 --> 18:06.428
I mean, he loses four of his kids,
his wife, then dies broke.

18:14.837 --> 18:17.675
The distinguished dude...

18:17.677 --> 18:20.146
Something with the newspapers
and stuff with him.

18:20.148 --> 18:22.815
I think it was the business
he was involved with.

18:23.984 --> 18:28.057
He was always traveling or
living in different places.

18:28.059 --> 18:31.057
He would have money,
and then he wouldn't have money.

18:31.059 --> 18:32.891
Like, he feels like people are after him.

18:34.593 --> 18:36.824
I think he's here because he wants help.

18:36.826 --> 18:39.493
So, he wants to get moved on.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.830
He doesn't think he's doing anything bad.

18:43.567 --> 18:44.966
So far,

18:44.968 --> 18:47.434
I know one of the original
owners of my client's property

18:47.436 --> 18:50.909
suffered one crushing
tragedy after another...

18:50.911 --> 18:54.844
losing his wife, four children,
and all of his money.

18:54.846 --> 18:57.914
But I need to see if there's something else.

18:57.916 --> 19:01.016
Searching through old records,
I find the death

19:01.018 --> 19:04.118
of a 14-year-old right
on my client's property.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.654
I'm on my way to meet with an archivist

19:06.656 --> 19:08.255
who did some digging

19:08.257 --> 19:11.023
on this 14-year-old kid's
death on Lisa's property.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.159
Turns out that's only half the story.

19:14.428 --> 19:16.028
She says after the kid died,

19:16.030 --> 19:18.130
his dad went on a downward spiral

19:18.132 --> 19:20.767
and got hooked up with an infamous con man.

19:25.473 --> 19:27.940
Well, Joseph Sulzner moved onto the property

19:27.942 --> 19:29.675
with his wife, Elonora,
and their four children.

19:29.677 --> 19:32.578
He owned a butcher shop, and then, in 1890,

19:32.580 --> 19:34.547
the same year he moved onto the property,

19:34.549 --> 19:36.215
he was appointed a meat inspector

19:36.217 --> 19:37.549
by the U.S. government.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.651
The kid... What happens to him?

19:39.653 --> 19:42.321
Well, in 1893, his eldest son, Christian,

19:42.323 --> 19:45.523
contracted typhoid fever,
and here's his death record.

19:48.690 --> 19:51.622
Now, you mentioned on the phone
that after this guy's kid died

19:51.624 --> 19:53.490
he got hooked up with some con man?

19:53.492 --> 19:55.759
What did you mean by that?
What was going on?

19:55.761 --> 19:58.228
Well, he got involved with James Larson,
a medical quack.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.062
A quack? Why do you call him a quack?

20:01.064 --> 20:03.563
Well, he wasn't an actual doctor.

20:03.565 --> 20:05.465
Before he even met Sulzner,

20:05.467 --> 20:08.635
he was arrested in St. Louis and fined $250

20:08.637 --> 20:11.305
for practicing medicine without a license.

20:11.307 --> 20:13.342
So, now,
why did Sulzner even hook up with this guy?

20:13.344 --> 20:14.510
What was the story?

20:14.512 --> 20:17.381
He had a fall at work and
ended up hurting himself

20:17.383 --> 20:19.918
and developing rheumatism from that injury.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.522
By 1919, it all catches up to him.

20:22.524 --> 20:24.790
He's paralyzed and bedridden,

20:24.792 --> 20:27.059
and he spends the next three
years of his life like that.

20:27.061 --> 20:30.797
And in 1922, he dies of cerebral hemorrhage.

20:30.799 --> 20:32.565
What about his wife?

20:32.567 --> 20:34.701
Well, she ends up spending
the next six years of her life

20:34.703 --> 20:35.768
alone,

20:35.770 --> 20:39.839
and she dies in 1928 of a stroke.

20:39.841 --> 20:42.941
Okay, so, if I got this right,

20:42.943 --> 20:44.977
this poor woman loses her son, who was 14,

20:44.979 --> 20:46.312
and her husband loses it

20:46.314 --> 20:48.948
and winds up hanging around
with this quack doctor,

20:48.950 --> 20:50.516
then she has to take care of him

20:50.518 --> 20:52.350
because he's bedridden for three years.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.184
He dies, and then she's alone for six

20:54.186 --> 20:56.120
and then winds up dying from a stroke.

20:56.122 --> 20:59.088
It sounds like she's the biggest
victim in this whole mess.

21:02.859 --> 21:06.361
The old lady,
she's very upset, very angry.

21:06.363 --> 21:08.896
I think she lost her family?

21:08.898 --> 21:12.167
The old woman who tortures
the living man in denial

21:12.169 --> 21:14.301
likes to hang out down here.

21:14.303 --> 21:16.336
She's angry that I'm here,

21:16.338 --> 21:19.242
but I'm starting to see
what she was like in life.

21:19.244 --> 21:22.180
She's talking about the meat.

21:22.182 --> 21:24.447
Yeah, she's showing me just how...
I guess how it was,

21:24.449 --> 21:28.486
and she's showing me putting
slabs of meat down here.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.119
This is weird.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.298
All I know is that she literally

21:36.300 --> 21:38.367
is, like, in love with this house.

21:38.369 --> 21:40.970
She <i> loves</i> this house.

21:40.972 --> 21:43.542
I think she was very lonely.

21:43.544 --> 21:44.876
I feel bad.

21:44.878 --> 21:47.879
I, like, see her, like,
talking to walls and stuff.

21:47.881 --> 21:52.852
I don't know if she was
mentally ill or she went crazy.

22:14.689 --> 22:17.659
Lisa's house sits right across
the street from train tracks.

22:17.661 --> 22:19.094
Believe me, you can hear it.

22:19.096 --> 22:21.195
Now, to cover all my bases,

22:21.197 --> 22:23.564
I reached out to a train
expert to look into it for me.

22:23.566 --> 22:25.200
I wasn't expecting much,

22:25.202 --> 22:27.770
but he just called me back, and he said

22:27.772 --> 22:29.973
he found three deadly
accidents on those tracks.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.820
So, professor, you mentioned on the phone

22:39.822 --> 22:41.490
that you found a lot of accidents

22:41.492 --> 22:44.193
regarding train tracks right
across from my client's house.

22:44.195 --> 22:47.730
From the opening in 1883,
there was constant death,

22:47.732 --> 22:50.035
constant injuries at this place.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.871
The rail roads were always
considered to be very hazardous.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.708
So, what about the first one you found?

22:54.710 --> 22:56.311
James Gattie, 1891.

22:57.782 --> 23:00.420
He's on the train tracks taking a shortcut,

23:00.422 --> 23:02.855
gets off the tracks when a train's coming,

23:02.857 --> 23:05.324
and then is surprised by another train,

23:05.326 --> 23:06.859
which will take his life.

23:06.861 --> 23:07.893
Geez.

23:07.895 --> 23:10.095
What are the other ones you found?

23:10.097 --> 23:13.468
Well, there's one in 1905,
which is a catastrophe.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.636
It involves over 100 men.

23:15.638 --> 23:18.505
They're waiting for the train
that usually takes them to work.

23:18.507 --> 23:19.672
Okay.

23:19.674 --> 23:21.573
But they're on the tracks waiting for it.

23:21.575 --> 23:23.642
All right, so, what happened?

23:23.644 --> 23:26.413
So, it's early in the morning, very foggy,

23:26.415 --> 23:28.348
and another train is coming behind them.

23:28.350 --> 23:31.917
In a matter of seconds,
they start pushing out on each other.

23:31.919 --> 23:33.854
Of course,
some people don't get off the tracks.

23:33.856 --> 23:35.923
It strikes them.

23:35.925 --> 23:38.824
There is three killed and two wounded.

23:49.973 --> 23:52.442
All right, so, let's go out here.

23:56.214 --> 23:59.984
So many people are hanging
out on the [bleep] lawn.

23:59.986 --> 24:01.987
And there's a lot.

24:03.291 --> 24:04.924
Do you know who these people are?

24:04.926 --> 24:07.326
No, I don't know yet. Um...

24:07.328 --> 24:11.067
I would probably put them at, like, um...

24:11.069 --> 24:14.607
between 1900 up to like 1920.

24:14.609 --> 24:16.377
Okay.

24:16.379 --> 24:18.481
A lot of them work together.

24:18.483 --> 24:21.320
They know each other's families.

24:21.322 --> 24:23.659
I'm trying to understand, like,

24:23.661 --> 24:25.562
why are they all together, you know.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.498
Usually when they're all together like that,

24:27.500 --> 24:29.500
they all died together, but...

24:32.336 --> 24:33.836
Okay, so,
that's two pretty bad accidents so far.

24:33.838 --> 24:34.904
What else did you find?

24:34.906 --> 24:38.173
It's a very sad story, very tragic story.

24:38.175 --> 24:41.712
It's going to happen in
1913 around Christmastime.

24:41.714 --> 24:44.246
There's a young couple, John and Dorothy,

24:44.248 --> 24:46.581
and they're coming back from church,

24:46.583 --> 24:49.185
and they decide to cut across the tracks.

24:49.187 --> 24:50.586
And suddenly,

24:50.588 --> 24:53.154
he saw the train barreling
down on him and Dorothy.

24:53.156 --> 24:56.654
He decides to sacrifice himself.

24:56.656 --> 25:00.057
He pushes her out of the way,
and he's struck.

25:00.059 --> 25:01.191
Ah.

25:01.193 --> 25:04.224
His arms are broken and skull is fractured.

25:04.226 --> 25:05.625
Wow.

25:05.627 --> 25:07.995
So, we got five deaths and a lot of injuries

25:07.997 --> 25:10.030
associated with my client's property

25:10.032 --> 25:11.328
with these train tracks.

25:11.330 --> 25:12.561
I mean, that's a lot.

25:12.563 --> 25:13.629
Yes.

25:13.631 --> 25:16.033
But that's just what's in headline news.

25:16.035 --> 25:18.868
I could show you where
a brakeman was killed,

25:18.870 --> 25:20.903
a flagman was killed.

25:20.905 --> 25:22.874
There's plenty of deaths that go unreported.

25:22.876 --> 25:25.543
It was pretty much a death trap.

25:29.681 --> 25:33.551
I'm trying to figure out their deal.

25:33.553 --> 25:36.421
Um... something about church with them.

25:36.423 --> 25:39.191
Going to church,

25:39.193 --> 25:41.694
but something happened to these people.

25:41.696 --> 25:43.797
Something quick, something fast.

25:51.040 --> 25:56.110
There's some kind of walkway here.

25:58.815 --> 26:03.084
Some kind of walkway that they're following.

26:05.956 --> 26:09.422
But I feel like everything should move back.

26:09.424 --> 26:13.996
Like,
I feel like everybody take a step back,

26:13.998 --> 26:16.200
and I don't know why.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.044
During my walk, I saw dozens of dead people,

26:29.046 --> 26:31.344
but what has me the most concerned

26:31.346 --> 26:34.916
is the living person being
tortured in the master bedroom.

26:34.918 --> 26:37.451
At the end of the bed is a dead guy.

26:37.453 --> 26:41.190
He's agitated.

26:41.192 --> 26:44.760
And then there's another
dead guy who's under the bed,

26:44.762 --> 26:47.863
shoving his knees up into the mattress.

26:47.865 --> 26:49.263
Okay.

26:54.901 --> 26:56.300
Is this what you saw?

27:00.069 --> 27:02.940
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:24.885 --> 27:27.787
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:27.789 --> 27:30.155
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

27:30.157 --> 27:32.756
and our clients for the first time.

27:32.758 --> 27:34.759
Amy, I'd like to meet you Lisa.

27:34.761 --> 27:37.029
This is her daughter Tamiera.

27:37.031 --> 27:39.266
Now, obviously, we're not in their house.

27:39.268 --> 27:42.903
The reason for that is Lisa's ex-husband,
who lives with them,

27:42.905 --> 27:45.871
didn't want us around all of a sudden,

27:45.873 --> 27:47.772
and he's not happy about the investigation.

27:47.774 --> 27:53.009
But these guys know they got a problem...
a serious problem.

27:53.011 --> 27:54.442
The activity's bad in their house,

27:54.444 --> 27:56.276
and it gets worse by the day.

27:56.278 --> 27:57.744
They called us in 'cause they want to know

27:57.746 --> 27:59.679
if it's gonna be safe
for them to live there.

27:59.681 --> 28:02.881
Right now, I'm gonna have Amy tell
us a little bit about her walk

28:02.883 --> 28:04.584
and see what she uncovered.

28:08.053 --> 28:11.191
I went into the house.

28:11.193 --> 28:18.367
I felt a lot of stress and panic,
a lot of anxiety.

28:18.369 --> 28:21.569
I did get that there are people in the house

28:21.571 --> 28:24.104
who are very open to the dead there.

28:24.106 --> 28:32.375
I heard,
um... a word right after I walked in,

28:32.377 --> 28:35.174
and the word was "denial."

28:35.176 --> 28:37.544
And, um...

28:37.546 --> 28:41.880
This is associated with a
particular person in the house.

28:41.882 --> 28:43.781
They've had experiences,

28:43.783 --> 28:46.948
but they are just, like,
completely denying it

28:46.950 --> 28:49.921
to themselves and to everybody else,

28:49.923 --> 28:53.557
and this is causing a lot
of the yelling and fighting.

28:53.559 --> 28:55.461
It's obvious who she's talking about, Lisa.

28:55.463 --> 28:57.933
Yeah. My ex-husband.

28:57.935 --> 29:00.366
Yeah, when we talk to him

29:00.368 --> 29:03.466
about what we've experienced in the house,

29:03.468 --> 29:10.137
he sometimes just ignore us,
and it's really gotten worse.

29:10.139 --> 29:15.342
The arguing and the anger, that's constant.

29:15.344 --> 29:18.312
You said people in the house are open?

29:18.314 --> 29:21.516
Tamiera's got an 8-year-old
daughter named Makayla.

29:21.518 --> 29:25.619
I have a picture of her.
She's a beautiful little kid.

29:25.621 --> 29:29.121
This is Makayla. Now, Kayla's also autistic.

29:30.423 --> 29:33.424
Would that make her more open to the dead?

29:33.426 --> 29:39.465
She refuses to be in the house by herself,

29:39.467 --> 29:42.102
and when we are in the room,

29:42.104 --> 29:44.205
she will point to certain corners,
saying, "Monster."

29:48.780 --> 29:51.812
It tears me up because
I don't know what to do.

29:55.016 --> 29:58.017
Okay, baby. It's okay.

29:58.019 --> 29:59.951
I don't know what to do.

29:59.953 --> 30:04.388
She's my baby. I love her to death.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.759
It's frustrating.

30:08.761 --> 30:10.863
It really is.

30:18.701 --> 30:22.135
There's three main conscious entities

30:22.137 --> 30:24.537
that hang out in the house.

30:24.539 --> 30:27.571
One of them is a female.

30:27.573 --> 30:29.772
She kind of has, like,
a witchy kind of look,

30:29.774 --> 30:31.539
so, like, a bigger nose and chin.

30:31.541 --> 30:33.107
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yes.

30:33.109 --> 30:35.410
And as soon as I hit the top of the stairs,

30:35.412 --> 30:38.411
to the left, there's a room.

30:38.413 --> 30:40.782
That's her ex-husband's room.
I went in there.

30:40.784 --> 30:45.448
And she was telling me how
much she hated this male.

30:46.885 --> 30:51.353
I think dead lady feels like
this dude shouldn't be here

30:51.355 --> 30:54.021
'cause he's no good for this living lady.

30:55.058 --> 30:57.324
She hates him a lot.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.659
Well, obviously,
the woman she's talking about...

31:01.661 --> 31:02.859
Is the old lady.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.927
Is the old lady you've
seen and you have seen.

31:04.929 --> 31:05.928
Yeah.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.163
Describe her.

31:07.165 --> 31:11.268
In my closet, I saw this old lady,

31:11.270 --> 31:14.876
just her face, looking at me.

31:14.878 --> 31:18.544
It was, like, smiling at me,
but it was real wide.

31:18.546 --> 31:20.714
You could actually see her teeth.

31:21.482 --> 31:24.281
Now,
who do you think this woman might've been

31:24.283 --> 31:26.315
when she was alive?

31:26.317 --> 31:30.789
She was talking about how
attached she is to the property,

31:30.791 --> 31:34.794
and then,
when I went down into the basement,

31:34.796 --> 31:37.595
she was going on and on and on

31:37.597 --> 31:42.568
about how she used to
store her meat down there.

31:42.570 --> 31:46.935
She was indicating that
her entire family died.

31:46.937 --> 31:49.840
I think she died alone.

31:49.842 --> 31:53.610
Now, you mentioned something
in the beginning about meat

31:53.612 --> 31:55.780
and how this lady was
attached to the property.

31:55.782 --> 31:57.915
What you said kind of makes sense

31:57.917 --> 31:59.616
because, in 1890,
a woman moved onto the property

31:59.618 --> 32:01.649
and lived in a different house
with her husband and her son.

32:01.651 --> 32:04.284
Her name was Elonora Sulzner.

32:04.286 --> 32:06.286
Her husband, Joseph, owned a butcher shop

32:06.288 --> 32:08.090
- right around the corner.
- Oh, okay.

32:08.092 --> 32:10.958
And later on became the meat
inspector for the state.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.358
Interesting.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.426
Now, you mentioned she lost her family.

32:14.428 --> 32:18.832
Now, she did lose her son at the age of 14.

32:18.834 --> 32:21.333
He died from typhoid.

32:23.738 --> 32:29.115
His name was Christian, and he died in 1893.

32:29.117 --> 32:31.584
Now, right after that happened, the husband,

32:31.586 --> 32:33.921
he had gotten hurt in an accident at work,

32:33.923 --> 32:35.456
and he developed rheumatism.

32:35.458 --> 32:38.325
And this guy wound up being bedridden

32:38.327 --> 32:41.230
for the last three years of his life.

32:41.232 --> 32:45.101
Now, in 1922, he dies.
Here's his death certificate.

32:45.103 --> 32:48.941
Now, Elonora lived alone for six years

32:48.943 --> 32:51.178
until she finally died
from a stroke in 1928.

32:54.784 --> 32:59.121
So, does that sound like
the woman you ran into?

32:59.123 --> 33:00.824
Yeah.

33:03.962 --> 33:09.435
So, the next person that I met was a guy

33:09.437 --> 33:14.672
who I kind of called the
distinguished gentleman.

33:14.674 --> 33:21.115
His whole thing is that he wants
help and he wants to leave.

33:21.117 --> 33:26.353
You guys are so open in this house,
he's keyed in on that.

33:26.355 --> 33:28.858
So, one of the things that I saw him doing

33:28.860 --> 33:32.560
was trying to get, you know,
the living's attention.

33:33.997 --> 33:35.799
Not only is he trying to reach you guys,

33:35.801 --> 33:37.667
but other people are trying to interfere

33:37.669 --> 33:39.568
with that... dead people...

33:39.570 --> 33:41.604
and so this pisses him off even more,

33:41.606 --> 33:43.474
and then he gets really agitated,

33:43.476 --> 33:45.575
and he starts acting out a little bit,

33:45.577 --> 33:47.844
and so what he'll do is scream and yell.

33:47.846 --> 33:52.779
He will sometimes cause
or create panic attacks.

33:55.449 --> 33:58.019
You had that look on your face
when she said panic attack.

33:58.021 --> 34:00.453
Because I feel like that a lot.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.057
As soon as I walk in, I'm like...

34:03.059 --> 34:05.860
"Ma,
I can't feel my heart speeding up."

34:05.862 --> 34:07.362
And then it kind of, like...

34:07.364 --> 34:10.196
You know how you feel your
heart kind of skip a beat?

34:10.197 --> 34:12.067
- Yeah.
- That's how it feels.

34:12.069 --> 34:16.242
And he wants them to move him on?

34:16.244 --> 34:20.112
Well, you know who he really
would like to have him move on

34:20.114 --> 34:22.213
is your ex.

34:22.215 --> 34:23.914
My dad?

34:23.916 --> 34:25.518
Mm-hmm.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.722
Wants her father to move him on?

34:29.724 --> 34:31.023
Wait. Huh?

34:31.025 --> 34:33.860
So now you're telling me that
he's probably got abilities.

34:36.732 --> 34:38.464
- Oh, wow.
- I knew it.

34:39.565 --> 34:41.969
Okay, so, now, the guy that you saw

34:41.971 --> 34:43.270
you said was distinguished, well-mannered...

34:43.272 --> 34:44.371
Yes, yes.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.672
Who was he in life? Any idea at all?

34:46.675 --> 34:48.675
He was traveling a lot, like for work,

34:48.677 --> 34:51.076
and then he was showing me how,
like, sometimes

34:51.078 --> 34:54.040
he would be really wealthy and
sometimes he'd be really poor,

34:54.042 --> 34:56.745
like it was always fluctuating for him.

34:56.746 --> 35:00.249
I think that his work was something around

35:00.251 --> 35:02.585
or to do with newspapers.

35:02.587 --> 35:04.484
You said this guy was a traveler,

35:04.486 --> 35:06.653
had something to do with newspapers

35:06.655 --> 35:08.689
and that, at points of his life,

35:08.691 --> 35:11.326
he had money,
then didn't have money, had money.

35:11.328 --> 35:13.725
The only guy that comes to mind
on the research on the property

35:13.727 --> 35:15.194
is this guy Edward Cappe.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.698
He came here from Ohio in the 1840s.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.701
He wound up operating a printing press

35:21.703 --> 35:25.306
for a local publishing company.

35:25.308 --> 35:29.276
Now, right after he moved
onto your property in 1872,

35:29.278 --> 35:31.912
things took a turn for him.

35:31.914 --> 35:34.281
Everybody started dying.

35:34.283 --> 35:38.420
I got death records here for
his wife and four kids that died

35:38.422 --> 35:39.922
during the time he was on your property.

35:39.924 --> 35:44.129
Now, in 1922, he died of stomach cancer.

35:44.131 --> 35:46.599
Now, you said this guy had
money but that he lost it.

35:46.601 --> 35:48.600
I was able to track down this guy's will.

35:48.602 --> 35:51.605
When you look at it,
he actually died owing $700.

35:51.607 --> 35:52.673
He died broke.

35:52.675 --> 35:54.740
Is it possible this could be the guy?

35:54.742 --> 35:56.441
It's possible.

35:56.443 --> 35:59.311
I mean, the newspaper thing is interesting.

35:59.313 --> 36:01.617
Now, that's two people.
You said there were three.

36:01.619 --> 36:03.053
So who's the third one?

36:03.055 --> 36:06.189
Yeah, the third guy is...

36:06.191 --> 36:08.425
I called him the instigator.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.762
He does have a bowler hat on.

36:10.764 --> 36:14.067
I saw him inside actually
messing with the living

36:14.069 --> 36:18.970
and, like,
really just trying to start [bleep]

36:18.972 --> 36:22.603
And his thing, too, is, like,
he really likes the drama,

36:22.605 --> 36:25.603
so, you know, he wants to see the fighting

36:25.605 --> 36:28.304
and the yelling and all this.

36:30.374 --> 36:33.979
Some of the things that the
instigator guy likes to do

36:33.981 --> 36:37.950
is he does like to make a lot of noise.

36:39.452 --> 36:42.824
Um, he will go under the bed and grab.

36:45.326 --> 36:48.091
I can't stand him.

36:49.259 --> 36:50.627
Now, you pretty much nailed everything

36:50.629 --> 36:53.028
these guys are experiencing.

36:53.030 --> 36:55.094
Tell her what happened.

36:55.096 --> 36:58.932
I was sleeping,
and I had my daughter with me,

36:58.934 --> 37:02.301
and I felt like somebody grabbed my ankles

37:02.303 --> 37:06.207
and just pulled me to the
bottom of the headboard.

37:06.209 --> 37:08.875
And the other thing is she was touched

37:08.877 --> 37:10.744
in an inappropriate manner.

37:10.746 --> 37:14.583
I was asleep, and I just... Something...

37:14.585 --> 37:16.786
It felt like something woke me up,

37:16.788 --> 37:21.188
and I just felt myself being touched.

37:22.490 --> 37:26.254
To my right,
this dark figure got off the bed,

37:26.256 --> 37:29.323
and then it disappeared.

37:31.492 --> 37:32.591
Does that make sense?

37:32.593 --> 37:34.091
Yeah.

37:36.459 --> 37:38.595
So, I had a sketch done

37:38.597 --> 37:42.562
of a scene that I witnessed in the bedroom,

37:42.564 --> 37:47.200
and both of the dead guys were in there,

37:47.202 --> 37:51.305
the distinguished guy and the instigator.

37:56.147 --> 37:58.449
Oh, geez. Take a look at this.

38:03.089 --> 38:06.388
I can't leave you.

38:06.390 --> 38:08.925
This is there. I can't leave you.

38:21.298 --> 38:23.431
So, I had a sketch done

38:23.433 --> 38:28.098
of a scene that I witnessed in the bedroom,

38:28.100 --> 38:32.797
and both of the dead guys were in there,

38:32.799 --> 38:36.894
the distinguished guy and the instigator.

38:43.030 --> 38:45.331
Oh, geez. Take a look at this.

38:54.496 --> 38:56.297
Oh, gosh.

38:56.299 --> 38:58.698
I can't leave you.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.831
This is there. I can't leave you.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.632
It's okay, baby.

39:07.072 --> 39:10.639
That's why Amy and Steve
is here to help us.

39:17.813 --> 39:19.280
So, Lisa, when we first met,

39:19.282 --> 39:21.181
you said you wanted your old life back.

39:21.183 --> 39:22.849
Yes. But now you know what took it away.

39:22.851 --> 39:26.885
The big question here is what
can you do to fight back?

39:26.887 --> 39:29.586
This way you, your daughter,
and your granddaughter

39:29.588 --> 39:31.057
can live there safely.

39:31.059 --> 39:33.791
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:37.263 --> 39:40.600
What you're going to do is
you're going to find a medium.

39:40.602 --> 39:44.605
The first thing that they
need to do when they come over

39:44.607 --> 39:48.142
is move the old lady on.

39:48.144 --> 39:50.981
The medium's objective is going to be

39:50.983 --> 39:57.023
reuniting this woman with
her dead 14-year-old son.

39:57.025 --> 39:58.659
So you think it's Elonora Sulzner?

39:58.661 --> 40:00.429
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

40:00.431 --> 40:04.165
Once that's done,
the medium's gonna be working

40:04.167 --> 40:09.311
on moving the distinguished gentleman on,

40:09.313 --> 40:11.044
and when she does that,
it'll go very quickly.

40:11.046 --> 40:13.512
- Because he's looking to go.
- Yes.

40:13.514 --> 40:14.747
Okay.

40:14.749 --> 40:19.451
Then you have the instigator guy.

40:19.453 --> 40:22.053
He's going to put up a fight,

40:22.055 --> 40:25.124
but the medium will be able to
force him out of your house.

40:25.126 --> 40:27.657
After everyone's been moved on,

40:27.659 --> 40:29.361
I want you to take this tar-water

40:29.363 --> 40:33.632
and put this at every entrance,
including the windows and doors.

40:33.634 --> 40:38.138
This will keep all of the dead out forever,
okay?

40:38.140 --> 40:40.341
Yes.

40:41.878 --> 40:44.213
I got a question for you.

40:44.215 --> 40:45.814
Your ex-husband, how's he gonna react

40:45.816 --> 40:48.152
to you having to bring in a medium?

40:48.154 --> 40:50.490
Um, I'm gonna find out.

40:50.492 --> 40:53.726
He's stubborn. He's not going to do it.

40:53.728 --> 40:55.362
Then he'll have to deal with it.

40:55.364 --> 40:57.400
- Yeah.
- I'll probably move

40:57.402 --> 40:59.903
because I don't want to
deal with it anymore.

40:59.905 --> 41:02.937
So, let's say her ex-husband
stays there and they leave.

41:02.939 --> 41:04.174
Have fun.

41:04.176 --> 41:06.643
If he stays there,

41:06.645 --> 41:11.546
I would not ever go to that
house and visit him, ever,

41:11.548 --> 41:14.517
because you'd be walking
into a [bleep] storm.

41:14.519 --> 41:16.652
Literally, all the focus

41:16.654 --> 41:20.956
would just be completely
and utterly on him.

41:20.958 --> 41:23.356
Last night, I straight-up called him...

41:23.358 --> 41:25.257
I was like, "You're selfish."

41:25.259 --> 41:26.993
He is selfish.

41:26.995 --> 41:29.229
"Because, you know,
this is happening to your granddaughter

41:29.231 --> 41:30.329
and you don't even care."

41:30.331 --> 41:31.797
You know, Lisa, normally I would ask you

41:31.799 --> 41:33.565
are you gonna take Amy's advice,

41:33.567 --> 41:36.436
but in this particular case with you,

41:36.438 --> 41:37.671
it's not that simple.

41:37.673 --> 41:39.205
No.

41:39.207 --> 41:42.041
But are you at least gonna, you know, try

41:42.043 --> 41:43.475
to talk to your ex-husband about this?

41:43.477 --> 41:46.513
Yes, definitely, I will. I will.

41:46.515 --> 41:47.915
Are you gonna help her, Tamiera?

41:47.917 --> 41:49.016
Yeah.

41:51.519 --> 41:54.454
Removing the dead is extremely important

41:54.456 --> 41:57.990
if Lisa and her family ever
want to find any peace.

41:57.992 --> 42:00.359
I can only hope her husband realizes this

42:00.361 --> 42:01.995
and allows a medium to come in

42:01.997 --> 42:05.500
and deal with the evil that's
terrorizing this family.
