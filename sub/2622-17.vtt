WEBVTT

00:06.881 --> 00:09.591
Oh, man.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.554
- What is that?
- Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

00:14.973 --> 00:18.225
What in the name of hell?

00:19.769 --> 00:21.937
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.608
- Hey.
- Whoa.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.444
Is this porn?

00:29.487 --> 00:32.031
What did I do? I must have
hit something on the remote.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.615
Do we pay for this?

00:34.909 --> 00:37.244
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.747
Maybe this is how they punish us.

00:40.331 --> 00:43.667
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

00:43.835 --> 00:47.129
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.718
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

00:53.595 --> 00:57.347
Yeah, Joey just pressed something
on the remote and it just came on.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.977
It happened to me once. I was flipping
through the channels and, bam.

01:02.145 --> 01:06.148
- It was like finding money.
- Finding money with naked people on it.

01:06.816 --> 01:09.485
Then I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.987
I never got it back again.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.280
And I'm sad.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.913
Why would he turn off the TV?

02:13.258 --> 02:16.552
All right, you know what? Do we really
have to watch this while we eat?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.512
No, no, no.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.307
We don't know
what could make this go away.

02:23.351 --> 02:27.229
Yeah, so no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the TV.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.566
And no one touches the air
around the TV.

02:32.193 --> 02:36.572
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.534
- I'm at least going to mute it.
- No, no, no.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.748
- We still have porn.
- Yeah.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.210
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.503
Honey, what are you doing?

02:51.671 --> 02:54.089
- That's too heavy. Give it here.
- Yeah.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.259
Oh, God.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.303
Okay.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.637
Ugh.

03:00.805 --> 03:05.309
I'm getting too pregnant for this...
Lugging around a stupid massage table.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.811
I have to find a job
where I carry a smaller table.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.938
Or a job where you don't
have to carry a table.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.024
You mean, like a doctor?

03:13.401 --> 03:15.694
Pheebs, you're blocking the porn.
Look out.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.196
Oh!

03:17.739 --> 03:18.947
Oh, my.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.618
Oh, that reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.958
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.669
So, uh, Emily just went to the airport.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.546
Aw. Why didn't you take her?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.465
Ehh, her uncle had planned on doing it.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.302
And you know, we said
our goodbyes this morning, so...

03:40.470 --> 03:44.431
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.560
No.

03:49.103 --> 03:51.730
Hey, cheer up.
You're gonna see her again, right?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.608
Well, that's the thing. I don't know.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.027
I mean, whenever I brought it up with her,
she said:

03:57.195 --> 04:00.614
"This is so fantastic.
Why do we have to talk about the future?

04:00.782 --> 04:03.158
- Let's enjoy..."
- Don't do the accent.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.870
You've got to see her again.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.664
Why do you care?

04:08.831 --> 04:10.165
Because.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.542
You could get to live out my fantasy.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.170
You've had fantasies about Emily?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.675
No. You know, the fantasy.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.510
Meet someone from a strange land...

04:21.678 --> 04:24.304
...fall madly in love
and spend the rest of your lives together.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.390
Is that why, in junior high...

04:26.557 --> 04:29.601
...you were the only one who hung out
with that Ukrainian kid?

04:30.853 --> 04:35.440
Yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.068
Do you love her?

04:39.362 --> 04:42.364
We said it was only gonna be
two weeks, you know?

04:43.658 --> 04:45.200
You love her.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.370
What is love, really?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.831
I knew you loved her.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.333
You need to go to the airport
and tell her.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.378
You're probably gonna catch her
just as she's about to go to the gate.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.548
You're gonna call out her name
and yell, "I love you."

04:59.716 --> 05:01.967
She's gonna say, "I love you too."

05:02.135 --> 05:05.262
Then you guys are gonna have
the most amazing kiss.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.764
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.851
I am a good kisser.

05:12.186 --> 05:16.064
Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.401
Things will start to heat up.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.237
And then a stewardess comes in...

05:23.990 --> 05:25.907
I've been watching too much porn.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.831
- Is that the heartbeat?
- That's it.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.167
Oh, my God.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.210
Oh, wow. This is so cool.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.548
Have we talked about the possibility
of multiple births?

05:42.675 --> 05:44.384
Why don't we just take care of this one?

05:44.552 --> 05:47.429
And should I get pregnant again,
I'll hold onto your card, okay?

05:48.389 --> 05:52.517
No, I'm getting three
separate heartbeats.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.229
Three? You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.150
- Doctors are wrong all the time.
- Well...

06:01.819 --> 06:04.154
Well, so are you sure
that there are three?

06:04.322 --> 06:06.907
- Definitely.
- Oh, my God.

06:07.492 --> 06:11.495
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Ha, ha.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.789
So in a few months...

06:13.956 --> 06:17.209
...I'm gonna have three full-grown babies
just walking around inside me?

06:18.836 --> 06:21.421
Oh, oh. And it's gonna be like
one of those log rides...

06:21.589 --> 06:24.132
...when they just come shooting out.

06:25.176 --> 06:28.595
Giving birth to three babies is not
that different than giving birth to one.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.347
What do you know?

06:36.312 --> 06:39.314
- Phoebe.
- Oh! Hi.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.235
So how'd it go at the doctor's?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.903
Oh, well, okay. Hey.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.989
You know how, when you're,
um, walking down the street...

06:48.157 --> 06:50.951
...and you see three people in a row.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.162
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

06:56.207 --> 06:58.500
- Yes.
- Okay.

06:58.835 --> 07:03.004
Yeah, well, good news.
You're gonna have three babies. Aah!

07:04.298 --> 07:06.383
- Three babies?
Uh-huh.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.593
Oh, oh!

07:08.803 --> 07:11.263
I've finally got my band.

07:12.181 --> 07:16.351
We're gonna have a big family!
I always wanted a big family!

07:16.853 --> 07:21.940
Oh, God. I'm so glad you guys are happy.
I was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.693
- Oh.
- Why would we be freaked?

07:24.861 --> 07:29.072
No, because maybe it's harder to raise them
and the added expense. Ugh!

07:30.908 --> 07:34.035
- Oh.
- Right.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.914
No, back to happy. Back to happy!

07:39.333 --> 07:41.918
No, no, no. It's gonna be fine...

07:42.086 --> 07:43.545
...because, um...

07:43.713 --> 07:45.547
Because I teach Home Ec.

07:45.715 --> 07:50.427
And I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

07:50.595 --> 07:55.182
You know, it'll be like
my very own little sweatshop.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.894
You know, I've been thinking...

07:59.061 --> 08:01.229
...ever since you said
that we're gonna have triplets.

08:03.983 --> 08:08.069
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.947
- Frank.
- No, you can't quit college. No.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.449
You're in college? Really?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.494
- Yeah, refrigerator college.
- Yeah.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.915
Yeah, you know, when we found out
we were gonna have a baby...

08:20.082 --> 08:24.961
...I figured, you know,
I should have, like, a career, you know?

08:25.129 --> 08:26.963
- And I love refrigerators.
- Yeah.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.592
You can't give up on your dream. Ugh.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.721
No, it's okay.
We're gonna have three kids.

08:34.889 --> 08:38.099
And that's a different kind of dream.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.018
Three kids and no money.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.778
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.780
Emily.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.615
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

08:54.951 --> 08:57.786
I just... I had to see you one more time
before you took off.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.956
You are so sweet.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.752
That's a big candy bar.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.882
I had the most amazing time with you.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.802
Me too.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.639
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 009.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.976
Well, that's me.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.318
Here, have this.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.487
I'm only allowed one piece
of carry-on anyway.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.159
Wait, uh...

09:38.536 --> 09:41.955
Listen, I have to tell you something.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.040
I've been thinking.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.836
I'm just going to come out and say it, okay?
Uh...

09:48.671 --> 09:50.255
I think...

09:51.048 --> 09:52.674
...I love you.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.012
Oh.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.352
Thank you.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.779
It's no problem.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.206
What is that song
that has been in my head all day?

10:25.374 --> 10:28.043
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.882
You know who doesn't even like
dirty movies?

10:34.050 --> 10:37.385
- My new boyfriend Joshua.
- Yeah, right.

10:38.929 --> 10:42.932
No, he told me he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.770
Oh, oh, yeah. Did he also say that he
thought some of the dialogue was corny?

10:46.937 --> 10:49.314
And that he actually found it funny,
not sexy?

10:49.482 --> 10:50.732
Yes.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.402
Yeah, he likes porn.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.490
Where you going?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.951
I'm gonna find out if he really thinks
supermodels are too skinny.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.120
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hi.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.748
- Hi. Hey.
- How'd it go with Frank and Alice?

11:06.916 --> 11:08.416
Frank has to quit college...

11:08.584 --> 11:12.212
...because his super-fertile sister
is having three babies. Ugh.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.631
I need to make a lot of money really fast.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.092
And I had an idea
that I wanted to talk to you about...

11:17.259 --> 11:19.260
...because you work for a big company.
Okay.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.595
Insider trading.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.808
What information is there
that you can give me?

11:24.975 --> 11:27.602
Well, actually, they don't really talk to us
about that stuff.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.771
I can get you some free White-Out,
though.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.360
Huh! Did you do what I said?
Did you tell her?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.404
- I did.
- And what did she say?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.072
"Thank you."

11:40.658 --> 11:43.660
You're totally welcome. What'd she say?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.622
She said, "Thank you."

11:47.790 --> 11:50.250
I said, "I love you."

11:50.418 --> 11:53.461
And she said, "Thank you."

11:54.797 --> 11:57.757
Oh, wait. Did you say you love her?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.802
Yeah, what were you trying
to get her to do?

12:02.680 --> 12:03.805
What do I do now?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.224
You play hard-to-get.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.644
She already lives in London.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.189
So you go to Tokyo.

12:14.650 --> 12:15.984
All right, look, forget it.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.028
Okay, forget it.
You told her you love her. It's over.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.282
It is not over. You're over.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.993
What?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.663
You know.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.459
Okay.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.336
Good one.

12:36.547 --> 12:40.175
It's not over because she's gonna call you
and tell you she loves you.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.803
The reason why she couldn't is because her
feelings were so strong that it scared her.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.055
Now, you go home
and you wait for her call.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.683
She could be calling you from the plane.
Come on, go.

12:48.851 --> 12:53.104
Okay, okay. But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over.

12:53.439 --> 12:57.984
No, wait, wait. Unless, eventually, I call her,
you know, to see what's going on...

12:58.152 --> 13:02.530
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.617
Then it's over.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.744
Way to be strong, man.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.088
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.341
Listen, can we watch cartoons
on your television?

13:21.509 --> 13:24.010
We need a porn break.

13:24.178 --> 13:28.139
We spent the last two hours watching
In and Out and In Again.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.976
Well, so why don't you just turn it off?

13:32.144 --> 13:35.021
Because then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.733
Oh, good, you're here.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.943
Hey.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.402
What you got there?

13:41.570 --> 13:44.572
Oh, this? Well, I'm glad you asked.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.203
Now, don't you hate it
when you have to cut a tin can...

13:50.371 --> 13:52.705
...with an ordinary steak knife?

13:54.583 --> 13:56.042
Ha.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.961
Now, I know what you're thinking.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.004
Pregnant woman slays four?

14:02.341 --> 14:04.384
They didn't make you pay
for those knives, did they?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.094
- No.
- Are you sure?

14:06.637 --> 14:08.012
No.

14:09.056 --> 14:12.100
You're not gonna make enough money
to help Frank and Alice by selling knives.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.351
No, no. I know that.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.479
But I just need to make enough money
for the second part of my plan.

14:16.647 --> 14:20.066
- What's the second part of your plan?
- My Saturn dealership.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.451
Hello?

14:31.203 --> 14:32.328
Ross?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.330
Emily. Hi.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.543
Uh, how was your flight?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.003
It was dreadful.

14:40.170 --> 14:44.632
Uh, I felt terrible about how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.553
No, no, that's all right. Um...

14:49.138 --> 14:51.139
I'm just glad you called.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.809
Ross, um, there's something
that I've got to tell you.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.063
There's someone else.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.655
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

15:09.992 --> 15:12.243
She doesn't know
which one of us she wants.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.329
Me or this "Colin" guy.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.999
This isn't how it was supposed to go.
I mean, there can't be another guy.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.667
Well...

15:20.836 --> 15:22.712
Of course there's another guy.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.923
Heh. This is even more perfect.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.343
Now you have to prove your love.

15:28.510 --> 15:32.680
I'm not proving anything, okay?
I'm done listening to you.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.892
If I hadn't let you talk me
into going to the airport in the first place...

15:36.060 --> 15:37.936
...I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.687
You put your fist through the wall?

15:39.855 --> 15:42.231
No, I missed and hit the door.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.526
But it opened really hard.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.530
- You have to go to London.
- What?

15:49.698 --> 15:51.366
Yep. You have to go fight for her.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.368
Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.579
Because you already told her you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.123
Then she called you and told you
there was another guy.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.209
So yeah. Go to London.
That will scare her.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.464
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.591
I made fun of his accent.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.470
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight at all. Am I right?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.931
You want the same thing
to happen with Emily?

16:15.099 --> 16:16.224
- No.
- All right, then.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.060
Go fight for her. Go to London.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.729
I mean, that could be you and Emily.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.985
That, but nicer.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.569
Just go to London.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.280
- Really?
- Come on.

16:31.448 --> 16:35.326
Surprise her. Show up at her doorstep.
Don't let her go without a fight.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.580
- All right. All right. I'm going to do it.
- All right.

16:39.748 --> 16:43.042
I'm gonna go to London,
and I am gonna fight for her.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.961
Okay. Good luck.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.339
Ross, Ross. If you're going to the airport...

16:48.507 --> 16:51.509
...can you pick me up another one
of those Toblerone bars?

16:58.434 --> 17:02.770
Oh, oh, I did it. I did it.
I figured out a way to make money.

17:02.938 --> 17:06.065
I'm gonna open up my own massage place
and Frank's gonna help me.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.402
And we can work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.029
La-la-la.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.365
That sounds great.
But how can you afford it?

17:14.532 --> 17:16.034
We were walking down the street...

17:16.201 --> 17:18.036
...and we saw that van
you used for catering.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.621
- And we realized...
- I'm telling it. I'm telling it.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.500
Okay, you know how people
need transportation...

17:24.667 --> 17:26.919
...but they also need massages to relax?

17:27.087 --> 17:31.716
So I just figured we could combine the two.
Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.720
I can fix up the van, bolt the table
in the back and you know what I've got?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.848
A place that no one
will ever get out of alive?

17:40.184 --> 17:45.313
No, think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.523
It's a Relaxi-Taxi.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.611
The name was my favorite part.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.281
- Well, I came up with it.
- You did not!

17:55.532 --> 17:57.075
Oh!

17:57.701 --> 18:02.455
No. You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.543
- Hello?
- Hey.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.214
Oh, my God. Ross, are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.424
No, because she hasn't come home yet.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.635
And she hasn't been home all night.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.387
She's obviously staying
with that other guy.

18:18.555 --> 18:22.141
And I'm the stupid moron who spent
the whole night outside her apartment.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.352
All right, when is the next flight out?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.812
About four hours.

18:25.979 --> 18:29.690
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours.
If she doesn't show up, come home.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.901
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

18:32.069 --> 18:35.404
And ask him if he thinks that is better
than Relaxi-Cab.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.701
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.246
Ooh, that is better.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.880
Are we in London?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.008
Why are you doing here?
You can't be here.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.261
I've come to talk to Ross.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.182
What?

19:06.311 --> 19:07.728
Nothing. No, nothing.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.730
I was gonna call him...

19:09.898 --> 19:12.900
Oh, you came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

19:13.068 --> 19:15.403
I was right! I'm right, right?

19:16.613 --> 19:17.989
I'd really rather talk to him.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.618
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.620
And I need to talk to him.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.331
So do you have any idea where he is?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.177
Ross, are you there?

19:42.055 --> 19:46.475
Ross, I don't know if you can hear this,
but I'm gonna talk anyway.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.854
I'm in the States
with your sister and your friends.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.315
And it's all over with Colin.

19:53.984 --> 19:57.195
I came here to tell you that
and to tell you...

19:57.779 --> 20:00.531
Yes, Joey, you can have
all the chocolate you want. Just take it.

20:03.452 --> 20:08.372
I came here to tell you that I love you.

20:09.499 --> 20:10.666
I love you too.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.420
I'm gonna call you right now
from the phone booth.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.714
You can't hear me.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.635
I wish I could know
if you'd heard any of that.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.222
I suppose I've either told you that I love you
or given my neighbors a good laugh.

20:24.389 --> 20:28.726
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. This is none of your business.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.438
Suppose there's not much chance
you did hear that.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.815
And there's the call waiting...

20:34.983 --> 20:38.194
...so I should go.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.696
Oh, well.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.367
Hello?

20:44.868 --> 20:46.327
Hi.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.957
Ross, I love you.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.750
Oh.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.295
Thank you.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.430
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:07.182 --> 21:10.184
I was just at the bank and there
was this really hot teller.

21:10.686 --> 21:14.438
And she didn't ask me
to go do it with her in the vault.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.066
Same kind of thing happened to me.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.110
Woman pizza delivery guy comes over...

21:19.278 --> 21:21.821
...gives me the pizza,
takes the money and leaves.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.324
What, no "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

21:26.034 --> 21:27.451
No, nothing.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.455
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.958
I think you're right.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.169
All right, ready?

21:37.337 --> 21:38.671
- One.
- Two.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.256
- Three.
- Three.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.845
That's kind of nice.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.307
- Yeah, that's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.065
- You want to see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.486
Free porn! We have free porn!
