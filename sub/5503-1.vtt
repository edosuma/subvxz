01:29.480 --> 01:34.443
Call down to the yard.
Tell them to notify me.

01:35.152 --> 01:37.363
Call them on the radio!

03:05.788 --> 03:09.500
Cosita linda, linda. Despierta, perra.

03:16.341 --> 03:22.847
¿Y tú, qué, cómo anda?
¿Tocando el piano? ¡Qué rica, mami!

03:27.060 --> 03:30.772
Dame la maleta. Voy al aeropuerto.

04:31.627 --> 04:33.462
Read this, puta.

04:55.818 --> 04:57.445
Thanks.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.022
Want a date, honey?

06:12.105 --> 06:15.484
Money, money, money.
Check this out.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.163
You wanna stop?

06:29.039 --> 06:31.251
No.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.638
§ Cheeba cheeba, y'all

06:43.763 --> 06:45.891
§ Said cheeba cheeba, y'all...

06:45.974 --> 06:48.018
§ Cheeba cheeba, y'all

07:00.530 --> 07:03.284
§ Let me tell you a little tale
about Peter the Pimp

07:03.367 --> 07:05.661
§ Sucka MC'ed, tryin' to cop a limp

07:05.744 --> 07:08.247
§ Rode around town in a couple of cars

07:08.330 --> 07:11.041
§ Got gagged by the man
tryin' to stick up a bar

07:11.166 --> 07:13.043
§ The judge said,
"Boy, what was on your mind?"

07:13.127 --> 07:16.464
§ He said, "I had some cheeba cheeba,
cocaine and some wine"

08:33.251 --> 08:37.422
"Le encantaban las matemáticas
pero, a su manera."

08:39.842 --> 08:45.014
"En vez de una división general,
es un general de división..."

08:45.097 --> 08:47.266
Yo, Tubes, my boy, what's up?

08:47.391 --> 08:50.645
- What?
- What's taking so long, man?!

08:50.728 --> 08:52.772
This'll take a few minutes.

08:52.855 --> 08:56.358
We ain't got a few minutes, man!
We got to get busy!

08:56.443 --> 08:58.486
Do me a favour, all right? Here.

08:58.611 --> 09:00.447
Calm down, all right? Relax.

09:00.530 --> 09:02.574
Yo, let me show you how to test this.

09:04.158 --> 09:07.287
Hecho in Paraguay.
Ciento por ciento puro.

09:07.412 --> 09:11.458
Right. It's dope! It's dope, Tito!

09:17.422 --> 09:21.551
Yo, man, you ever get the feeling
you was being watched? Damn!

09:23.387 --> 09:27.724
You got any soda, man?
Like some root beer or something?

09:27.807 --> 09:31.979
I hurt my leg playing ball and I got
these aspirins to take, you know?

09:32.688 --> 09:34.732
Man, what the fuck is he...?

09:34.857 --> 09:38.903
Turn this shit off. What kinda help
you got? Watching cartoons?!

09:39.028 --> 09:43.950
Tell him to turn the TV off and get me
a soda. Una Coca-Cola, por favor.

09:44.033 --> 09:47.620
Baja y búscale una Coca-Cola.

09:47.703 --> 09:50.456
Yeah, and make sure it's cold.

09:50.581 --> 09:53.751
I like my shit cold when I'm playing ball.
You play ball?

09:55.753 --> 09:59.007
You don't look like you do,
but yo, nice gloves.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.426
- Hey, Jump.
- What's up?

10:01.551 --> 10:04.179
- It's copacetic.
- Now maybe you satisfied.

10:04.262 --> 10:08.017
Maybe now I wanna check out
another one. I'm no Joe Neckbone.

10:08.142 --> 10:12.521
- Trust ain't one of my stronger qualities.
- I guarantee this shit!

10:12.604 --> 10:16.776
To hell with testing.
Let's get to the large plus 10 per cent.

10:20.237 --> 10:22.281
Did he say 10 per cent?

10:22.406 --> 10:26.452
Tito, man, we had a deal! What's up?!
What 10 per cent you talking about?

10:26.577 --> 10:30.039
Transportation costs, amigo.
I got expenses.

10:30.289 --> 10:34.335
Well, take the train!
Why you wanna be greedy, Tito!

10:34.419 --> 10:39.757
That's our price. No-one else even talks to
you goddamn coños! Take it or leave it.

10:40.842 --> 10:44.720
Why you wanna talk to me like that, man?
Take it or leave it...?

10:45.263 --> 10:47.473
Take it or leave it?

10:48.350 --> 10:50.394
I'll take it.

10:51.812 --> 10:54.814
Cos I like you, I'm gonna take it.

10:54.898 --> 10:57.067
Pack this shit up.

10:57.317 --> 10:59.653
El verde, negrito.

11:01.030 --> 11:03.907
You in power, Tito. You in power.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.911
You the king, Tito.

11:24.804 --> 11:26.847
Where's my soda?

11:33.646 --> 11:38.234
Apresúrate con la Coca!

11:41.113 --> 11:43.031
What the fuck is this?!

11:43.115 --> 11:45.617
They're for the bullet holes, puta!

11:52.958 --> 11:55.127
Room service, motherfuckers!

14:22.571 --> 14:25.449
There's somebody here to see you.

14:54.187 --> 14:56.231
What's in the cup?

15:00.068 --> 15:02.112
Root beer.

15:08.911 --> 15:10.954
You want some?

15:15.418 --> 15:17.586
There's some things I don't do.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.635
Bop bop bop!

15:24.719 --> 15:27.472
Wo-o-o-oh!

15:27.555 --> 15:29.056
Pah!

15:32.102 --> 15:35.439
What's happenin'? Hey, look at you!

15:46.241 --> 15:48.701
Welcome back home, Frank!

15:51.580 --> 15:54.291
- All right!
- Yo, congratulations, Frank!

15:54.375 --> 15:57.878
Congratulations, man.
The Colombian motherfuckers...

15:57.961 --> 16:01.131
took permanent vacation in hell,
if you know what I mean.

16:02.549 --> 16:05.510
Well, I must have been away
too long because...

16:05.595 --> 16:07.638
my feelings are dead.

16:07.722 --> 16:09.849
I... I feel no remorse.

16:09.974 --> 16:11.892
It's a terrible thing.

16:13.352 --> 16:16.397
I heard jail makes
you feel like that, man.

16:16.481 --> 16:19.984
I got a present for you.
They were King Tito's.

16:20.067 --> 16:23.404
But he don't need them where he is now.

16:25.115 --> 16:30.495
I thought maybe you would donate 'em
to a clothing drive or somethin'.

16:31.537 --> 16:33.623
That's great, man.

16:33.874 --> 16:36.126
Having a good time Jump?

16:36.209 --> 16:39.088
Hey, man, I've been waiting years for this.

16:39.171 --> 16:43.258
Emilio Zapa... sends his regards!

16:47.221 --> 16:49.765
You know how I love money.

16:49.849 --> 16:51.851
Well, help yourself.

16:55.521 --> 16:58.065
Is the meeting set with Dalesio?

16:58.149 --> 16:59.358
Downtown.

16:59.442 --> 17:02.570
You need to let me bust a cap
in that motherfucker's ass.

17:02.653 --> 17:03.654
Word!

17:03.737 --> 17:09.327
He's a fuckin' glitter boy, looking to get
sprayed, laid, played and slayed!

17:09.410 --> 17:11.537
I heard that!

17:14.749 --> 17:16.166
So...

17:16.291 --> 17:18.837
are you gonna come down, say hello?

17:18.920 --> 17:21.673
You can hobnob with them homos
if you want to.

17:21.756 --> 17:25.676
I'm going downtown, find me a girl,
get my knob polished.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.804
Time for a real party!

17:30.932 --> 17:32.976
Jim...

17:37.398 --> 17:40.234
how come you never came to see me?

17:42.945 --> 17:45.573
Who wanted to see you in a cage, man?

17:48.743 --> 17:50.787
Of course.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.461
- Later!
- Later!

17:58.544 --> 18:01.214
Champagne. Let's break out.

18:09.097 --> 18:12.016
Yes. Yes.

18:13.727 --> 18:15.562
It's King Tito's.

18:15.646 --> 18:18.107
King Tito's glove!

18:21.943 --> 18:27.407
It's a good thing he's dead,
cos I'd wrap that glove right round...

18:53.602 --> 18:55.436
Sex.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.480
And it's how much?

18:57.563 --> 18:59.650
Well, wait for the paperback.

18:59.733 --> 19:01.902
It's too fuckin' much for me!

19:02.486 --> 19:04.195
- You should read it.
- Why?

19:04.280 --> 19:09.576
- Because you might learn something.
- What? How to be good?

19:09.702 --> 19:14.039
Joey, just don't say a word, OK?
I don't want you to say anything.

19:14.122 --> 19:18.002
- We're going home, right?
- I know. I'm tired. Where is he?

19:29.597 --> 19:31.682
Welcome home, Frank.

19:50.869 --> 19:53.538
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

19:53.622 --> 19:55.833
Nice to see you.

20:01.838 --> 20:03.799
Thanks for everything.

20:03.883 --> 20:06.052
To freedom.

20:06.135 --> 20:08.179
Come on.

20:13.642 --> 20:15.686
Earl, nice to see you.

20:15.769 --> 20:19.274
- Earl, Charlie, you know Frank.
- How are you?

20:19.357 --> 20:22.902
Judge, how are you?
I want to introduce you to...

20:22.985 --> 20:27.239
- I wanna say hello to your junior partner.
- OK. Fine.

20:38.585 --> 20:42.172
Be more careful of the affairs
you attend, Counsellor.

20:42.256 --> 20:44.717
One is known by the company one keeps.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.176
Right, Joey?

20:46.260 --> 20:49.346
- Pete, how are you?
- Hey, Frank. Welcome home.

20:49.430 --> 20:51.098
Hello, Frank.

20:55.519 --> 21:00.023
Welcome back.
You know everybody here, I think.

21:02.193 --> 21:05.946
Pete, how's the family? Brian? Dennis?

21:06.030 --> 21:10.368
Better than when you left town.
They're all working. And you?

21:10.451 --> 21:12.495
Back from the dead.

21:12.578 --> 21:16.208
Frank White, I've heard a lot about you.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.709
And it's all bad.

21:18.793 --> 21:22.297
Don't believe everything
Pete writes in the columns...

21:22.422 --> 21:24.507
because, well...

21:25.508 --> 21:28.387
Anyway, I've been reformed.

21:28.470 --> 21:32.474
A lot of people will be happy
to hear that. Huh, Pete?

21:32.557 --> 21:36.270
What can we expect from
the reformed Frank White?

21:37.271 --> 21:40.107
I wanna be Mayor.

21:47.823 --> 21:49.867
Thinks I'm kidding.

21:51.452 --> 21:53.329
First...

21:53.412 --> 21:55.456
I wanna talk to Arty Clay.

21:55.539 --> 21:59.293
Relax, we're supposed
to be having a good time here.

21:59.377 --> 22:01.713
I wanna talk things over with him.

22:01.796 --> 22:04.716
He's a fuckin' animal.
He won't meet with you.

22:04.799 --> 22:07.719
Maybe I can get one of his lieutenants.

22:07.803 --> 22:13.057
Tell him... Frank White wants
to talk business with him.

22:13.141 --> 22:17.729
Just tell him that... all I wanna know
is where and when.

22:18.855 --> 22:22.609
Counsellor, they did a wonderful job
with this gentleman.

22:22.693 --> 22:24.903
He's better than ever.

22:24.986 --> 22:27.030
If you'll excuse me.

22:27.113 --> 22:32.077
I'll see you people in a little while,
if I'm still around.

22:38.209 --> 22:40.419
Look at you!

22:44.298 --> 22:46.342
Look at you.

22:46.425 --> 22:49.429
What's the matter?
Are you not glad to see me?

22:49.512 --> 22:55.184
You belonged where they put you.
Maybe this time you'll stay out of trouble.

22:55.268 --> 22:57.938
That depends on
how good my lawyers are.

22:58.021 --> 23:01.525
I thought people like you didn't
believe in the legal process.

23:04.111 --> 23:08.240
I thought people like me
were the legal process.

23:15.414 --> 23:17.666
You know what?

23:20.252 --> 23:23.213
You know what I'd like to do... to you?

23:24.965 --> 23:27.009
I would like...

23:27.092 --> 23:29.429
to take you on the subway.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.990
What can I do for you?

23:49.074 --> 23:51.785
Tell Arty I need to speak to him.

23:52.577 --> 23:55.038
- Wait here.
- Sure.

24:07.051 --> 24:11.597
There's some yarm out there
that wants to talk to you.

24:19.438 --> 24:21.482
Ace is still the better.

24:21.565 --> 24:25.278
- Arty, you're...
- What's happening here?

24:28.739 --> 24:29.824
200.

24:29.908 --> 24:31.492
I'll put 200.

24:31.575 --> 24:33.619
I gotta see you, too.

24:33.787 --> 24:36.540
All right, one shot. Last ticket.

24:36.623 --> 24:39.251
Johnny, give me something good.

24:39.334 --> 24:41.669
Arty. Gentlemen.

24:43.171 --> 24:46.216
- Chi è chisto?
- Nun sacc'io.

24:50.762 --> 24:52.806
- Who goes?
- Arty.

24:53.432 --> 24:56.519
All right. I bet 200. Go ahead.

24:56.602 --> 25:02.232
I got a message from Frank White.
He wants to sit down, he wants to talk.

25:03.192 --> 25:06.361
Tell him I don't talk to nigger lovers.

25:06.445 --> 25:08.739
All right, what's down?

25:08.823 --> 25:14.245
He says he's got things to discuss with
you. He wants to know where and when.

25:14.328 --> 25:17.332
Tell him in fuckin' hell, that's where!

25:17.457 --> 25:21.669
He's gonna wish his lawyer left him
fuckin' the sambos in the joint!

25:21.752 --> 25:24.547
I was making a lot of money
off them Colombians.

25:24.631 --> 25:26.049
That's right.

25:27.301 --> 25:30.679
If that's what you want me
to tell him, I'll tell him.

25:30.762 --> 25:32.848
Why, it ain't clear enough?

25:34.641 --> 25:37.644
Tell that son of a bitch
he made a big mistake with me.

25:37.727 --> 25:39.646
And tell him something else.

25:39.729 --> 25:42.024
This is what Arty Clay has to say!

25:43.233 --> 25:45.068
Shit, man!

25:45.152 --> 25:47.613
You tell him personally, from me.

25:48.030 --> 25:50.449
Stay outta here!

25:55.037 --> 25:57.748
Come on, sit down. Let's go.

26:26.821 --> 26:28.655
I missed you.

27:12.659 --> 27:15.620
Your watch and your wallet, blood.

27:18.832 --> 27:20.876
How about that?

27:38.352 --> 27:41.856
Come by the Plaza Hotel.
I got work for you.

27:41.940 --> 27:43.983
Ask for Frank White.

28:00.792 --> 28:04.713
It's up to me, right?
You guys are in trouble. I bet 200.

28:07.591 --> 28:11.553
OK. Hurry up, will ya?
I'm down a lot of money here.

28:11.637 --> 28:13.680
Let's play cards.

28:21.105 --> 28:23.148
I got your message, Arty.

28:25.526 --> 28:27.945
You stupid son of a bitch.

28:28.029 --> 28:31.157
You running games here? I wanna play.

28:31.282 --> 28:34.077
Sure, Frank, play. Bring your friends.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.204
Nah. I wanna play with Arty.

28:36.287 --> 28:38.331
Let's go, will ya?

28:38.414 --> 28:40.416
Jump deals.

28:41.292 --> 28:43.336
Blackjack, house out.

28:44.045 --> 28:45.672
Hey!

28:47.173 --> 28:50.135
You got some balls, coming here.

28:58.352 --> 29:00.396
Pick up the card.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.523
Pick up the card.

29:02.606 --> 29:04.066
Pick it up.

29:13.576 --> 29:15.327
OK.

29:15.411 --> 29:19.540
From here on,
nothing goes down unless I'm involved.

29:19.624 --> 29:23.127
No blackjack, no dope deals, no nothing.

29:23.211 --> 29:26.589
A nickel bag gets sold
in the park, I want in.

29:29.384 --> 29:33.429
You guys got fat while
everybody starved on the street.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.598
It's my turn.

29:37.600 --> 29:43.732
You think you're gonna live long enough
to spend that money, you fuckin' hump?

29:55.786 --> 29:57.579
If any of you...

29:57.663 --> 30:01.167
are tired of getting
ripped off by guys like that...

30:06.964 --> 30:09.801
you come with me.
I'm at the Plaza Hotel.

30:09.884 --> 30:12.595
You're welcome. You're all welcome!

30:12.679 --> 30:14.722
Enjoy!

31:51.155 --> 31:53.825
Man or ghost, I'll kill you again!

32:20.686 --> 32:22.521
Ed.

32:22.605 --> 32:24.482
Ed!

32:24.565 --> 32:27.359
Aisha, how you been?

32:28.444 --> 32:31.613
I'm very upset about
what happened today.

32:31.698 --> 32:35.659
Frank, I did the best that I could,
and you know that.

32:35.744 --> 32:39.539
- Edward... how are you?
- Hello, counsellor! How are you?

32:39.622 --> 32:41.958
- Alicia, how are you?
- Aisha.

32:42.041 --> 32:44.711
The city councilman
was explaining to me...

32:44.794 --> 32:49.549
why that hospital in the South Bronx
didn't survive the fiscal cut today.

32:49.632 --> 32:52.511
I'm telling him how disappointed I am.

32:52.594 --> 32:56.473
I was explaining that there simply
wasn't money in the budget.

32:56.557 --> 32:59.894
In a city of 12 million,
I find that hard to believe.

32:59.977 --> 33:02.021
I'd hoped we could do better.

33:02.104 --> 33:05.983
I'd hoped so, too, Frank,
but there simply was no money.

33:06.066 --> 33:09.111
If you think it's so easy,
try funding it yourself.

33:10.362 --> 33:12.406
- Maybe I will.
- OK.

33:12.489 --> 33:15.784
How about 16 million
by the end of the quarter?

33:18.705 --> 33:22.000
Tell your friends they'll have the money.

33:22.083 --> 33:25.545
Counsellor,
you're this man's legal advisor.

33:25.628 --> 33:30.216
Explain to him the hard financial facts
of running a municipality.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.343
I know what this city needs.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.431
Privileged districts shouldn't be
the only ones with hospitals!

33:36.514 --> 33:40.477
- Forget it, Frank.
- I want that place kept open.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.563
The city can't afford it. Neither can you.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.524
The city doesn't know
where to get the money.

33:46.608 --> 33:51.905
Let me give you some expensive advice:
Go where you can stay out of trouble.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.032
That's what I pay you for.

34:09.466 --> 34:13.219
- Hello, Frank. I wanna talk to you.
- I don't think so.

34:13.344 --> 34:16.096
Come on!
O'Neill can wait for two old friends.

34:16.181 --> 34:19.601
- I'm not your friend.
- Come on, Frank. We missed you.

34:19.684 --> 34:22.938
- I thought about you, too.
- I heard a rumour about you.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.188
What's that?

34:24.272 --> 34:27.525
You got AIDS getting
dicked up your ass in prison.

34:27.650 --> 34:30.987
I thought about you
every time I jerked off, dickhead.

34:31.196 --> 34:34.783
- Why don't we take this outside?
- Next time, wear a tie.

34:34.866 --> 34:37.409
- Get Abe.
- Here we go.

34:42.123 --> 34:46.795
Excuse us, folks. Excuse us. Easy. Easy.
Excuse us. Excuse us. Easy. Easy.

34:46.878 --> 34:48.965
Here we go.

34:52.009 --> 34:55.554
- What the hell is this?
- Taking him in for questioning.

34:55.638 --> 34:57.765
On what grounds? This is harassment.

34:57.849 --> 35:01.978
You're welcome to come along.
Even your client's got a right to counsel.

35:42.978 --> 35:45.022
Come on, get out!

35:46.608 --> 35:49.903
- Look inside.
- Yeah, take a good look.

35:50.444 --> 35:52.989
Let's go.

35:55.408 --> 35:58.203
- What's that?
- You tell me.

35:58.286 --> 36:01.456
- I don't know.
- This is your only chance.

36:01.539 --> 36:04.084
- Are you arresting me?
- Fuck, here we go.

36:04.167 --> 36:07.170
If not, I got people waiting for me.

36:07.253 --> 36:09.298
Shut the fuck up, motherfucker!

36:13.134 --> 36:18.515
Frank, I wanna tell you something. Come
here, Frank. Here, Frank. Meet somebody.

36:18.598 --> 36:22.978
- What is this shit?
- All right, that's it! That's it!

36:23.687 --> 36:25.856
I'm gonna cap the mother!

36:25.939 --> 36:29.068
Get in the fuckin' car! Get in the car!

36:30.862 --> 36:32.905
This how you do things?

36:32.989 --> 36:35.741
I know what you're up to, White.
Forget it.

36:35.825 --> 36:39.161
I'll make you and your friends
disappear long before that.

36:42.498 --> 36:44.584
Welcome home, fuckface!

36:44.667 --> 36:46.711
Gilley! Get in the fuckin' car!

36:46.795 --> 36:51.299
Last fuckin' time, you fuck!
We're onto your fuckin' ass!

36:51.382 --> 36:53.760
Give your friends that message.

37:37.097 --> 37:40.975
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

37:41.059 --> 37:44.145
The best man has something to say.

37:44.228 --> 37:49.902
I'd like to thank Tommy Flanigan for being
the only black male at an Irish wedding.

37:49.985 --> 37:53.530
- Are you comfortable, Tom?
- Yeah, real comfortable.

37:53.613 --> 37:57.910
- All my buddies are here. All my brothers.
- He's sweating! OK...

37:57.993 --> 38:03.916
Joe... Joe Mulligan, father of the bride.
Joe provided these lovely decorations.

38:03.999 --> 38:07.128
Where'd you get these, Joe?
An AA meeting?

38:07.211 --> 38:10.840
And he paid for the whole thing!
The whole $200!

38:11.883 --> 38:16.929
Joe, by the way, put your shotgun away.
The tests came back negative!

38:17.012 --> 38:18.640
All right, all right.

38:18.723 --> 38:25.397
Roy Bishop, do I detect a little Afro sheen
on that unusually wavy hair of yours?

38:25.480 --> 38:31.361
Tip... Kathy... the finest couple I ever had
the pleasure to know. Join me, folks.

38:31.444 --> 38:35.365
They're the only couple still together
in this neighbourhood!

38:35.449 --> 38:37.492
I wish you health, wealth...

38:37.576 --> 38:40.829
happiness, a lot of babies, no cops.

38:40.954 --> 38:45.125
We don't need no more degenerate
donkeys runnin' around with guns.

38:45.208 --> 38:49.713
All bullshit aside, I think I speak for
everybody. We love you. God bless.

38:49.796 --> 38:52.549
- Hear, hear!
- Here's to youse.

38:52.633 --> 38:55.260
- How did I do?
- I'm proud of ya.

38:55.344 --> 38:58.681
Hey, Father, thank you for coming.

38:58.765 --> 39:01.392
Let's get Father laid. Come here!

39:03.644 --> 39:06.355
Give me a real drink.

39:06.439 --> 39:08.900
Would you get us a drink over here?

39:08.983 --> 39:11.569
- Get the house a drink!
- Yeah!

39:11.653 --> 39:15.490
The bar's not open now! You pay!

39:28.670 --> 39:30.714
That's my wife!

39:32.382 --> 39:35.468
It was a fuckin' joke! Will you relax?!

39:35.553 --> 39:38.597
Virginia, come here. Come here.

39:38.680 --> 39:42.310
Tip! Take a tip. Gilley's after your wife.

39:42.393 --> 39:46.230
- Obvious, isn't it?
- It's more than obvious...

39:46.314 --> 39:48.942
by the vampire marks on her neck!

39:49.066 --> 39:51.443
Get him outta here!

39:54.739 --> 39:59.160
- What's what, my friend? How you doing?
- What's what? Terrific.

39:59.243 --> 40:04.291
- How come you're not dancing?
- I'll leave that to the father of the bride.

40:04.374 --> 40:06.793
Are you gonna make it through the night?

40:06.876 --> 40:09.838
Are you kidding?
I'm the one that needs the honeymoon.

40:09.921 --> 40:14.300
- All they do is stay in bed all fuckin' night!
- Do me a favour.

40:14.384 --> 40:18.054
Give this to the kids.
I got a million things to do.

40:18.138 --> 40:22.601
- You sure you won't come in?
- Nah, I'll see you during the week.

40:22.684 --> 40:26.522
All right.
You take it easy? Take care, Pops.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.132
You can tell your boyfriend...

41:33.215 --> 41:37.219
to forget about it.
He ain't got enough money.

41:37.303 --> 41:41.683
- Maybe he'll surprise you.
- I don't like his fuckin' surprises.

41:41.766 --> 41:45.061
He's got a lot of nerve
even sending you here.

41:52.652 --> 41:57.282
You could step all over that shit
and still get 120 a gram.

41:57.365 --> 41:59.826
And I got 220 pounds of it.

42:01.203 --> 42:04.415
Comes to 15 mill, street value.

42:04.498 --> 42:08.252
And I want guarantees
nobody in this town can give.

42:10.546 --> 42:12.465
Especially him.

42:12.548 --> 42:16.260
Look, Larry,
why don't you set the terms?

42:16.344 --> 42:18.847
I'll go back and I'll tell Frank.

42:18.930 --> 42:21.558
If you two see eye to eye,
we make a deal.

42:21.641 --> 42:25.061
If not, everybody goes
their own way, still friends.

42:25.144 --> 42:29.858
- What do you say?
- That cocksucker ain't got no friends.

42:29.941 --> 42:34.654
And before I sit across a table with him,
he gotta know one thing.

42:34.737 --> 42:37.866
I ain't no fuckin' greaseball
named Arty Clay.

42:40.410 --> 42:42.454
You got it.

42:43.622 --> 42:46.292
And he pays for your cut.

42:48.335 --> 42:49.378
Yeah.

42:49.461 --> 42:51.505
Why don't you stick around?

42:51.588 --> 42:54.508
I got Frankenstein coming on next.

42:58.846 --> 43:03.851
Stop fuckin' with my lady...
I told him, stop fuckin' with my bitch.

43:03.935 --> 43:08.731
And when he started crying like a bitch,
he got fucked like a bitch!

43:08.814 --> 43:11.525
You hear what I'm saying?

43:11.609 --> 43:14.487
We're gonna shoot the bitch!
Shoot the bitch!

43:14.571 --> 43:18.866
Hey, what you want, man?
You want white meat, right?

43:18.950 --> 43:21.369
No, dark meat!

43:21.453 --> 43:23.496
Don't shoot me!

43:32.631 --> 43:34.716
Can I help you?

43:34.800 --> 43:38.846
You can give me 15 pieces
of chicken, motherfucker.

43:38.929 --> 43:41.307
I want barbecue and I want crispy.

43:41.390 --> 43:44.101
- You getting this all down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:44.184 --> 43:47.396
I want six pieces of corn,
and I want...

43:47.521 --> 43:51.734
Yeah, give me eight spare ribs.
And... 12 pieces of shrimp.

43:53.569 --> 43:56.239
Some onion rings...

43:57.072 --> 44:00.827
- You want tartar sauce or ketchup?
- Tartar sauce.

44:00.910 --> 44:04.330
- You got potato salad?
- We ain't got no potato salad.

44:04.413 --> 44:08.251
Look, get away from the games!
You ain't got no money! Just get away!

44:08.334 --> 44:12.047
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- Yo, is that it?

44:12.130 --> 44:15.174
Yeah, that's it.
Make sure you get my food. Get it now.

44:15.258 --> 44:19.262
And don't be drooling on it, man.
And I better not get none of that cat.

44:19.346 --> 44:21.390
I want chicken.

44:24.059 --> 44:27.480
Here. Y'all go play the games.

44:27.563 --> 44:30.107
No offence, ma'am.

44:30.191 --> 44:33.486
But you make sure
they get what they want?

44:33.569 --> 44:35.613
Go ahead, go ahead.

44:35.696 --> 44:37.823
Y'all go play them games.

44:37.906 --> 44:41.452
Play them games. Here, baby.
Here, go play the games. Go ahead.

44:41.536 --> 44:45.623
Yo, what's happenin' with the food, man?
I ain't got all day.

44:45.706 --> 44:49.002
- That'll be $56.70 total.
- Did I say I was finished?

44:49.085 --> 44:51.671
Maybe I want birch beer.
You got birch beer?

44:51.754 --> 44:53.756
We don't have no birch beer.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.468
- You got root beer?
- We ain't got no root beer.

44:56.551 --> 44:58.595
- How much is this?
- $56.90.

44:58.678 --> 45:01.139
$56.90? Fuck you very much.

45:01.222 --> 45:05.351
Hey, scumbag! Guess what?
You're under arrest.

45:07.437 --> 45:09.481
Police!

45:11.567 --> 45:13.652
It's all over, Jimmy.

45:13.777 --> 45:18.239
You're under arrest for the murder
of Mata, Tito, and Santo Domingo.

45:18.324 --> 45:21.410
You have the right to remain silent,
so shut the fuck up.

45:21.493 --> 45:25.998
- Did you use this on Mata?
- Yeah. Same one I'm gonna use on you!

45:26.081 --> 45:29.460
For the rest of your life,
you gonna be somebody's bitch!

45:29.543 --> 45:31.838
Some motherfucker named Bubba!

45:31.921 --> 45:36.509
- I'll slap the black off of your face!
- Take the cuffs off!

45:36.592 --> 45:41.097
This is the happiest day of my life,
cos we got a real, live witness.

45:41.181 --> 45:45.102
- I don't leave no witnesses!
- Oh, yeah? You must be gettin' old!

45:45.185 --> 45:49.605
I'm gonna get you fuckin' guys!
I'm gonna fuck you up!

46:02.953 --> 46:05.414
This is our nursery.

46:11.212 --> 46:16.425
Without private assistance,
everything we've seen will close down.

46:16.509 --> 46:20.137
I can't stress enough
how much your help could mean...

46:20.221 --> 46:23.599
to the families that depend on us
for medical care.

46:23.682 --> 46:25.935
Please, just look around.

46:35.152 --> 46:37.196
Look, Larry.

46:38.489 --> 46:43.495
The most anybody is gonna give you
for your stuff is 30 grand a key.

46:43.578 --> 46:46.248
That's about $3 million on a bulk sale.

46:46.331 --> 46:52.421
So whoever buys it is gonna cut it, bag it,
sell it on the street, for 150 a gram.

46:52.504 --> 46:56.466
That's $150,000 a key,
five times what they paid you.

46:56.550 --> 47:00.512
So now your quintal's worth $15 million...

47:00.595 --> 47:05.100
a mark-up of 11 million something
that you get no part of.

47:05.184 --> 47:10.523
I know you don't have the manpower
to peddle the uptown streets, but I do.

47:10.606 --> 47:14.026
You put up the stuff,
I put up the guys to sell it.

47:14.110 --> 47:17.864
I take the heat and the risk...
if there is any.

47:17.947 --> 47:22.618
We divide the difference, setting aside
something for places like this.

47:22.702 --> 47:24.745
What do you say?

47:26.832 --> 47:29.709
If I was into socialised medicine...

47:29.793 --> 47:33.254
I would have stayed
in the Peking province.

47:33.338 --> 47:35.799
I want cash for my goods.

47:36.258 --> 47:40.930
- How much?
- Three million up front... like you said.

47:41.888 --> 47:45.184
Plus another half a mill
when you unload it.

47:45.267 --> 47:49.105
- That's a lot of money.
- Well, I got a lot of shit.

47:49.188 --> 47:51.232
Make up your mind.

47:53.317 --> 47:56.236
- Very well.
- You know something, Frank?

47:57.238 --> 48:02.827
This conversation... made me realise
just how fuckin' crazy you really are.

48:51.169 --> 48:53.213
Everything's all set up.

48:53.296 --> 48:57.884
I don't think you should go alone.
I don't trust that fuckin' crazy Chinaman.

48:57.968 --> 49:02.931
It's Enrico Mata. He's in a hospital
with a police guard around him 24 hours.

49:03.014 --> 49:05.808
He's agreed to testify for them in court.

49:05.893 --> 49:08.812
They got Jump cold this time.
It's murder one.

49:08.895 --> 49:10.939
Did Abe get them to set bail?

49:11.022 --> 49:14.109
- $1 million apiece.
- So go sign 'em on.

49:14.192 --> 49:18.238
Posting that much will raise
more problems than it solves.

49:18.321 --> 49:23.702
Get Abe to see if his friends can get
this cop transferred or retired.

49:23.785 --> 49:25.829
I want him out of my way.

49:25.912 --> 49:29.750
He's the chief investigating officer.
Don't even think about it.

49:29.833 --> 49:31.877
Ask him...

49:32.837 --> 49:37.550
before I blow Bishop's brains
all over his fuckin' wing tips.

49:39.427 --> 49:41.929
Get some guys and pick 'em up.

49:42.012 --> 49:44.057
You got it, Frank.

50:04.578 --> 50:07.873
Yo! Captain Crunch
and that Doughnut Crew is here!

50:07.956 --> 50:10.584
Yo, fellas.
What's up? Long time, no see.

50:10.667 --> 50:13.546
We having a party.
Bring the Chocolate Wonder.

50:13.629 --> 50:16.507
Your mother's coming.
We having a real good time.

50:33.692 --> 50:35.735
Gimme some!

50:37.486 --> 50:39.530
Black man!

50:41.407 --> 50:44.285
Here, get some flowers for your witness.

50:46.913 --> 50:49.374
Jimmy, we got business to do.

50:51.085 --> 50:53.128
Get some cheap ones.

50:53.212 --> 50:55.630
And you can kiss my ass, too!

50:55.714 --> 50:58.175
- See you downtown.
- OK, yeah.

51:01.095 --> 51:03.139
What?

51:06.266 --> 51:08.519
Proud of yourself, Counsellor?

51:08.602 --> 51:12.106
You know, if you got a problem,
take it to the judge.

52:20.385 --> 52:22.720
Get him! Get him!

52:46.578 --> 52:48.622
Where's the stuff, Larry?

53:16.818 --> 53:19.988
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

53:20.071 --> 53:22.115
Mr Freddie Jackson.

53:24.410 --> 53:26.703
§ All my life

53:26.787 --> 53:29.165
§ I've been waiting

53:29.248 --> 53:33.252
§ For a time when I'd be free

53:34.294 --> 53:36.797
§ How I prayed

53:36.880 --> 53:39.383
§ For liberation

53:39.550 --> 53:43.346
§ And a little bit of dignity

53:44.472 --> 53:48.476
§ I heard the heartbeat of the city

53:49.685 --> 53:54.190
§ How it pounded
and it sounded in the night

53:54.691 --> 53:58.653
§ The children's voices were so pretty

53:58.903 --> 54:01.656
§ I'm gonna reach out,
I'm gonna take it

54:01.739 --> 54:03.867
§ I'm gonna make it all right

54:03.951 --> 54:06.078
§ Dream on

54:06.578 --> 54:08.622
§ For a better day

54:09.248 --> 54:14.044
§ When we can live our lives
and our hopes won't fade away

54:14.211 --> 54:15.880
§ Dream on

54:17.005 --> 54:19.258
§ For a better way

54:19.466 --> 54:21.469
§ We'll join our hands together

54:22.136 --> 54:24.305
§ And build a brand-new day

54:24.388 --> 54:25.889
§ Dream on

54:26.932 --> 54:30.186
Thank you. Thank you.
You are all so tremendous.

54:30.269 --> 54:34.565
I was born in this neighbourhood
and, as I grew up, I used to pray...

54:34.649 --> 54:39.070
that, once I got out, I would never
have a reason to come back.

54:39.153 --> 54:41.864
I'm glad those prayers
weren't answered...

54:41.947 --> 54:45.785
because my neighbourhood's
looking mighty pretty lately.

54:45.868 --> 54:49.706
And I've been encouraged,
both in public and in private...

54:49.789 --> 54:53.377
that, where there's a will to help,
there's a way to do it.

54:53.460 --> 54:57.423
So on behalf of the council,
myself, and New York City...

54:57.506 --> 55:01.968
I thank you for what you've done.
And I ask for your continued support...

55:02.051 --> 55:06.891
until we have the kind of general hospital
this borough needs.

55:08.559 --> 55:11.228
§ I'm gonna reach up,
I'm gonna take it

55:11.311 --> 55:15.066
§ I'm gonna make it all right

55:15.899 --> 55:17.943
§ Dream on

55:19.028 --> 55:21.447
§ For all that could be right

55:21.531 --> 55:23.616
§ We can make it happen

55:23.700 --> 55:25.827
§ We can make it better

55:25.910 --> 55:28.746
§ Just dream on

55:28.829 --> 55:31.374
§ For a better way

55:31.457 --> 55:34.085
§ We'll join our hands together

55:34.211 --> 55:36.296
§ And build a brand-new day

55:36.379 --> 55:40.509
§ Dream on

55:45.347 --> 55:48.558
We're reporting live
from the Harlem Ballroom...

55:48.642 --> 55:54.022
where city luminaries are celebrating
the project to rebuild the general hospital.

55:54.106 --> 55:59.862
One local politician said, "It's a proud
moment for the city and all New Yorkers."

56:02.615 --> 56:05.201
Roy... He's a movie star!

56:05.284 --> 56:09.330
Frank is a fuckin' movie star now.

56:09.455 --> 56:13.417
Oh, my God. Help me, gentlemen.
Help me.

56:13.501 --> 56:15.336
A toast.

56:15.419 --> 56:17.297
A toast.

56:17.380 --> 56:20.174
Come on! Toast! Frank! He made it!

56:21.176 --> 56:23.929
- All right?
- Fuckin' King of New York.

56:24.012 --> 56:27.099
- The King... of New York.
- King!

56:28.892 --> 56:34.189
We, on the other hand, waste our time
interrogating witnesses...

56:34.272 --> 56:37.609
liftin' fingerprints -
my favourite, and yours...

56:37.692 --> 56:40.946
court orders - right, Roy?...

56:41.029 --> 56:46.326
so Frank's Park Avenue attorney...
can get him out in ten minutes.

56:46.410 --> 56:50.330
Ten minutes later... he's on the street.

56:50.414 --> 56:56.087
I thought we were what's right.
I thought the law counted for somethin'.

56:56.170 --> 56:58.214
But this whole system...

56:58.297 --> 57:00.341
favours the scumbag.

57:05.263 --> 57:08.224
We make - what? - $36,000 a year?

57:08.307 --> 57:11.185
- $36,500.
- $36,500. Thank you.

57:11.894 --> 57:15.815
I was the best man at your wedding.
Thank you very much.

57:15.898 --> 57:20.278
$36,500 to risk our lives
every night of the week...

57:20.987 --> 57:24.282
and Frank gets rich on killing people.

57:27.994 --> 57:30.039
Roy...

57:36.628 --> 57:38.630
Roy...

57:38.713 --> 57:41.592
there's only one way to get Frank.

57:47.973 --> 57:52.686
We can make it look like a rival gang,
if that makes you feel any better.

57:52.770 --> 57:56.691
Are you gonna shoot everybody
you can't arrest, Dennis?

57:56.774 --> 57:58.819
That's not your fuckin'...

57:58.902 --> 58:02.280
You know what my problem is with you?
I can't do my job.

58:02.364 --> 58:07.243
My job is to protect the people of this city,
and you won't let me.

58:11.331 --> 58:14.919
You do anything stupid,
I'm coming after your ass.

58:16.753 --> 58:19.173
With or without you...

58:19.381 --> 58:21.842
I'm gonna get rid of Frank.

58:22.050 --> 58:24.761
OK? So now you know.

58:24.845 --> 58:29.391
This guy belongs in a fuckin'
rubber gun squad. He's a nut.

58:30.518 --> 58:32.561
You know, Roy...

58:33.270 --> 58:36.857
every time Frank
kills somebody out there...

58:36.940 --> 58:38.985
it's our fault.

58:41.154 --> 58:43.156
Can you live with that?

58:43.239 --> 58:45.075
I can't.

58:57.129 --> 59:00.965
§ "Saturday Night" by Schoolly D

59:16.273 --> 59:18.734
§ It was Saturday night
and I'm feelin' kinda sporty

59:18.818 --> 59:21.111
§ Went to the bar, caught me a forty

59:21.195 --> 59:22.863
§ Got kinda high and-a kinda drunk

59:22.947 --> 59:25.699
§ So I kicked the ass of this little punk

59:25.783 --> 59:28.036
§ Forgot my key, I had to ring my bell

59:28.119 --> 59:30.538
§ My momma came dressed,
she said "Who the hell?"

59:30.622 --> 59:33.165
§ "Wait, Momma, wait,
it's me, your little son"

59:33.250 --> 59:35.252
§ Before I knew it, my mom pulled a gun

59:35.335 --> 59:37.753
§ "I know who y'are,
but who the hell is that?"

59:37.837 --> 59:40.048
§ I turned around, man, this bitch was fat

59:40.131 --> 59:42.425
§ I really don't know,
she got into the car

59:42.508 --> 59:44.803
§ I musta picked her up
when I left the bar

59:44.886 --> 59:47.096
§ Y'know I'm horny-homey man,
I wanted to chill

59:47.180 --> 59:49.641
§ But you know how mothers are,
she wanted to ill

59:49.724 --> 59:51.977
§ So I said,
"Hey, baby, is you on the pill?"

59:52.061 --> 59:54.521
§ "Cos tonight I wanna be your lover"

59:54.604 --> 59:56.940
§ "Just one thing.;
I forgot to buy a rubber"

59:57.024 --> 01:00:00.527
§ Wait a little while,
then we snuck upstairs...

01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:10.621
It's something that you've
looked at all your life.

01:00:10.872 --> 01:00:14.708
It crosses your mind that
you'll never see it again.

01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:32.352
I've lost a lot of time.

01:00:35.396 --> 01:00:37.440
It's gone.

01:00:37.524 --> 01:00:40.151
From here on I can't waste any.

01:00:41.403 --> 01:00:45.658
If I can have a year or two,
I'll make something good.

01:00:47.826 --> 01:00:49.870
I'll do something.

01:00:54.666 --> 01:00:56.710
Something good.

01:00:58.462 --> 01:01:01.257
Just one year. That's all.

01:01:03.384 --> 01:01:06.429
I want to get into a series of instruments...

01:01:06.512 --> 01:01:10.016
with respect to buying
the dollar against the yen...

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:15.271
not against the Deutschmark,
the Swiss Bank, or any other currency.

01:01:46.554 --> 01:01:49.765

Arthur Clay, Lawrence Wong.

01:01:52.059 --> 01:01:55.897
Take a good look.
You represent the man responsible.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.024
Are you out of your mind?

01:01:58.107 --> 01:02:00.527
You're a lawyer.
How can you be part of this?

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.154
- Part of what?
- Don't pretend you don't know.

01:02:03.238 --> 01:02:06.241
I don't pretend.
You got evidence? Prosecute.

01:02:06.324 --> 01:02:09.619
By then it'll be too late.
Bring him in.

01:02:38.107 --> 01:02:41.193
We're gonna go see Frank, all right?

01:02:57.586 --> 01:03:00.088
§ I'm Black! Too damn powerful

01:03:00.172 --> 01:03:02.257
§ I'm still a bad boy, get an eyeful

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.384
§ And if you're tired of the other MC's

01:03:04.467 --> 01:03:06.178
§ Well, come on in

§ My brain, my brain is so full
of words, verbs, adjectives, pronouns

01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:32.497
§ Come on in and sit on down

01:03:32.705 --> 01:03:35.124
§ Just listen to what you been missin'

01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:37.335

You ain't gonna introduce me

I wanna make a good impression on 'em.

01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:48.283
- I wanna know who I'm selling drugs to.
- You don't sell drugs - you shoot people.

Yo, I'm unemployed, man!
Ain't nobody left!

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.502

You want me to get you
something to drink?

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:42.214
No. If you don't mind,
I wanna get right down to it.

01:05:42.298 --> 01:05:48.345
You got a lot of shit to move, and Joey
thinks I might be interested in pursuing it.

Taste it.

01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:06.406

after I recoup from street sales.

01:06:21.504 --> 01:06:25.634
- For half the cash, you get half the drugs.
- It's all or nothing, man.

01:06:25.718 --> 01:06:31.556
I'll leave Carlos here to walk through
the rest of the shit, and I'll be back later.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.684
Good.

01:06:37.313 --> 01:06:39.356

I'll kill you, motherfuckers!

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:21.586
Get off the fuckin' car, man!

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:24.006
You motherfucker!

01:10:26.883 --> 01:10:28.844
Get off the fuckin' car, man!

01:10:30.888 --> 01:10:31.971
Oh, shit!

01:10:35.809 --> 01:10:38.104
Nobody rides for free, motherfucker!

01:10:52.618 --> 01:10:54.537
Go! Go!

01:11:07.133 --> 01:11:10.345
Shit! Fuck you!
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:12:10.407 --> 01:12:13.034
Slam your fuckin' brains out, Frank!

01:12:58.581 --> 01:13:01.209
Get the fuck in front of 'em!

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.970
Oh, shit!

01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:34.911
Get the fuck out the way!

01:13:35.954 --> 01:13:39.708
Move your fuckin' car!
Move it outta the way!

01:14:11.949 --> 01:14:13.993
Shit!

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.831
Shit!

01:14:21.584 --> 01:14:23.628
They're gone.

01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:26.590
I don't believe this.

01:14:26.673 --> 01:14:29.217
I don't fuckin' believe this.

01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:42.355
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.108
What's that?

01:14:46.193 --> 01:14:48.237
Nothing!

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:30.155
Fuck!

01:16:04.482 --> 01:16:06.526
Come on, Jimmy!

01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:09.655
It's me and you, buddy!

01:16:09.738 --> 01:16:11.782
Where's Frank?

01:16:11.865 --> 01:16:14.827
Tired of being his fuckin' flunky?

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:16.954
I see he left you?

01:16:17.037 --> 01:16:20.457
Come out, Jimmy! Where you at!

01:16:23.711 --> 01:16:25.755
It's me and you, Jimmy!

01:16:28.841 --> 01:16:30.885
Hey, Jimmy, guess what?

01:16:30.968 --> 01:16:33.429
I got a piece of chicken here!

01:16:33.512 --> 01:16:37.308
You chicken-eatin' motherfucker!
Come on!

01:16:44.607 --> 01:16:46.651
Come on, be like a man!

01:16:53.283 --> 01:16:55.327
Jimmy!

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:07.131
Come on, Jimmy!

01:17:07.214 --> 01:17:09.258
Just me and you!

01:17:12.011 --> 01:17:13.971
Jimmy!

01:17:14.054 --> 01:17:16.098
Let's talk it out, brother!

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.308
Come on!

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:23.857
Where the chicken at?
Yo, Black!

01:17:24.566 --> 01:17:25.608
And a soda?

01:17:25.691 --> 01:17:28.861
Where's my soda, Black?
You know I like soda.

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:30.988
What? What? What?

01:18:04.398 --> 01:18:08.360
- Where's your girlfriend, motherfucker?
- Hey! Scumbag!

01:18:21.916 --> 01:18:23.876
Fuck you!

01:18:25.128 --> 01:18:28.005
Kill me, motherfucker!

01:18:28.090 --> 01:18:29.758
Come on!

01:18:32.302 --> 01:18:38.600
All right. You're not bad, you're not bad,
you're not bad. You gotta relax.

01:18:38.683 --> 01:18:40.728
No, no, no. Listen, relax.

01:18:40.811 --> 01:18:43.146
Can you take a breath?
Can you take a breath?

01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:45.982
All right, let me help you.
Let me help you.

01:18:52.406 --> 01:18:54.367
Tommy? Tommy?

01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:55.450
Tommy!

01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:06.254
Tom! Oh! You...!

01:19:08.714 --> 01:19:10.508
Tommy? Tommy?

01:19:27.026 --> 01:19:29.653
I got the motherfucker!

01:19:35.534 --> 01:19:37.870
I killed the motherfucker!

01:19:52.134 --> 01:19:54.178
Kill me!

01:20:20.039 --> 01:20:22.082
I love you.

01:20:23.124 --> 01:20:25.168
I love you, Tommy.

01:20:45.022 --> 01:20:46.858
Daddy!

01:20:49.736 --> 01:20:52.155
What am I gonna do without him!

01:22:07.817 --> 01:22:09.985
You motherfuckin'...!

01:22:10.194 --> 01:22:11.946
You motherfucker!

01:22:15.616 --> 01:22:17.660
Fuck you!

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:21.622
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:25.251
Fuck you!

01:22:30.882 --> 01:22:33.218
Hey. You.

01:22:56.492 --> 01:22:58.536
Bring his ass over here!

01:22:58.619 --> 01:23:02.665
- Get up! Get the fuck up!
- I can't get up! I can't get up!

01:23:02.748 --> 01:23:05.501
Come on! Get up! Get up!

01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:08.462
Where's Frank?

01:23:08.546 --> 01:23:11.007
Get up. Frank's coming.

01:23:12.592 --> 01:23:15.387
- Come on!
- Don't hurt me! Don't touch me!

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:19.432
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- Yo! Chill! Chill! Chill!

01:23:19.516 --> 01:23:24.354
Frank... Shit, man, listen.
You gotta listen to me, man.

01:23:24.771 --> 01:23:26.773
Frank...

01:23:26.857 --> 01:23:32.196
they gave me some names. I checked
them out. They were fuckin' cool, man.

01:23:32.279 --> 01:23:37.034
I had no reason to think they were cops,
man. Those motherfuckers set me up!

01:23:37.117 --> 01:23:41.664
They set me up just as much as you,
Frank. You gotta believe me, man.

01:23:41.747 --> 01:23:43.957
It ain't like it seems, Frank.

01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:46.836
- It ain't like it seems.
- No me niegas.

01:23:46.919 --> 01:23:50.923
No estoy negando, Frank.

01:23:51.007 --> 01:23:53.843
Somos amigos. Just tell me why.

01:23:53.926 --> 01:23:56.637
Don't lie to me, man. Just tell me why.

01:23:59.306 --> 01:24:01.350
Just tell me why.

01:24:11.027 --> 01:24:15.990
It was the money, all right?
It was the fuckin' money!

01:24:16.074 --> 01:24:19.161
- Puta!
- Motherfucker!

01:24:19.745 --> 01:24:21.163
Don't!

01:24:21.246 --> 01:24:24.291
They offered me more money
than I'd ever seen, Frank.

01:24:24.375 --> 01:24:28.254
I'd be in the protection programme.
I was out, man, I was free.

01:24:28.337 --> 01:24:31.256
You can understand that.

01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:35.678
- Where's the money now?
- We've got it.

01:24:35.761 --> 01:24:38.556
He was carrying it around with him.

01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:42.435
Bury it with him.

01:24:42.518 --> 01:24:44.312
Frank... Frank...

01:24:44.395 --> 01:24:46.731
Yo, Frank! Frank! Frank!

01:24:46.814 --> 01:24:48.316
Frank!

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.569
I'm sorry, Frank! Frank!

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:52.862
Frank!

01:24:54.113 --> 01:24:56.157
Frank, I'm sorry, man!

01:26:13.571 --> 01:26:19.201
When the DA's office investigated
the sudden death of Arty Clay...

01:26:19.284 --> 01:26:24.457
they found that he left a $13 million
estate. How do you explain that?

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:29.879
Then there's Larry Wong, who owned
half of Chinatown when he passed away.

01:26:29.962 --> 01:26:33.132
Larry used to rent his tenements...

01:26:34.259 --> 01:26:37.429
to Asian refugees, his own people...

01:26:37.512 --> 01:26:39.556
for $800 a month...

01:26:39.639 --> 01:26:43.184
to share a single toilet on the same floor.

01:26:43.268 --> 01:26:45.311
How about King Tito?

01:26:46.646 --> 01:26:50.734
He had 13-year-old girls
hooking for him on the street.

01:26:52.862 --> 01:26:54.989
Those guys are dead...

01:26:55.072 --> 01:26:56.949
because...

01:26:57.032 --> 01:26:59.868
I don't wanna make money that way.

01:27:05.833 --> 01:27:07.459
Emil Zapa.

01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:11.756
The Mata brothers. They're dead...

01:27:11.839 --> 01:27:15.760
because... they were running this city
into the ground.

01:27:15.843 --> 01:27:18.804
You expect to get away with
killing these people?

01:27:18.888 --> 01:27:23.018
I spent half my life in prison.
I never got away with anything.

01:27:23.101 --> 01:27:27.147
And I never killed anybody
that... didn't deserve it.

01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:29.691
Who made you judge and jury?

01:27:32.902 --> 01:27:36.407
Well, it's a tough job
but somebody's gotta do it.

01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:41.578
Now, for the likes of Arty Clay
and the rest of those bums...

01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:45.332
you slap a tag on me for $50,000.

01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:50.421
You make me public enemy...
number one.

01:27:50.505 --> 01:27:55.134
Is that some kinda joke? Well...
I got a message for you and your friends.

01:27:55.218 --> 01:28:01.640
You tell 'em I got a quarter-million-dollar
contract on anyone involved in this case.

01:28:02.975 --> 01:28:06.104
Now we all get to know
what it's like not knowing...

01:28:06.187 --> 01:28:09.232
when some asshole's
gonna blow your head off.

01:28:09.316 --> 01:28:13.445
I want you to know
what it's like to live that way.

01:28:14.195 --> 01:28:16.239
You tell 'em what I said.

01:28:16.322 --> 01:28:21.495
- And you'll still be around to see that?
- Where's the fuckin' phone?

01:28:23.997 --> 01:28:26.249
We're not talking about me.

01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:30.045
We're talking about
taking over drug cartels.

01:28:35.259 --> 01:28:40.264
You think ambushing me is gonna
stop what makes people take drugs?

01:28:40.347 --> 01:28:45.603
This country spends $100 billion a year
on getting high.

01:28:45.686 --> 01:28:51.025
And it's not because of me,
all that time I was wasting in jail...

01:28:51.108 --> 01:28:53.445
It just got worse.

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:57.699
I'm not your problem.
I'm just the businessman.

01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:06.750
Take out your piece. Be careful.

01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:15.133
Careful.

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:18.303
The cuffs.

01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:22.975
Cuff yourself to the chair.
It's a stupid thing to do?

01:29:26.813 --> 01:29:29.398
Sit down. Put 'em on the chair.

01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:41.160
Now you know what it's like.

01:29:41.244 --> 01:29:43.580
Welcome... to the circle.

01:29:54.632 --> 01:29:56.676
Bang, bang!

01:32:38.635 --> 01:32:40.679
White.

01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:49.939
A man with a price on his head
shouldn't ride the subway.

01:32:50.022 --> 01:32:51.648
It's over.

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:54.902
- Let it go.
- You let it go.

01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:58.197
See this?

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.991
Come on, you wanna see something?

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:03.119
How bad do you want me?

01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:05.831
Don't worry, but don't move.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:09.960
Frank, put the gun down.

01:33:10.043 --> 01:33:15.006
And make it easy? I've done things
you wouldn't even think about.

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:19.469
Why should you be different?
You got that gun. Use it. Come on!

01:33:19.553 --> 01:33:21.680
No more stories, Frank.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:24.016
Put the fuckin' gun down.

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:28.103
See this woman? Nice woman.
Do you have a family?

01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:33.567
I don't wanna hurt you, but I will blow you
away if I have to. You understand?

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.361
Yes, sir.

01:33:35.444 --> 01:33:37.488
Could you do that?

01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:40.491
Leave her alone, Frank. It's me and you.

01:33:40.575 --> 01:33:42.619
Me and you.

01:33:44.328 --> 01:33:46.372
You can't hide behind her for ever.

01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:48.416
I don't need for ever.

01:36:41.011 --> 01:36:43.055
Just drive.
