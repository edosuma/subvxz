02:37.240 --> 02:38.575
Shit.

03:03.808 --> 03:04.809
Damn it.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.210
Mom!

03:48.937 --> 03:49.979
God damn it.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.862
- Let me do that.
- No. Stay back.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.996
- I can finish this.
- You wanna kill him.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.290
No, I don't want to. But I should.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.377
You lay one finger on him,
and you are dead to me again.

04:13.711 --> 04:14.712
All right.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.507
How do you suggest we handle this?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.721
I'm gonna find another option for you.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.933
Something that isn't The Raft.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.313
But until then, he isn't leaving this tub.

04:35.441 --> 04:39.696
Kidnapping. All you, by the way.
We're both in this now.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.615
No, we're in some shit,
but I'm not in anything with you.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.118
I just don't want my kid to go to prison.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.537
Well, I don't want my mother
to murder anyone else.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.789
If he wakes up, he will go straight
to the police.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.041
When he wakes up, I will remind him

04:52.125 --> 04:56.170
that attempted murder is a Class B felony
with a five-to-ten-year sentence.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.880
He busts us, I bust him.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.466
- It's a bad plan.
- You're a bad plan.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.770
- Oh, for Christ's sake, let me.
- I got it.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.441
- You're just gonna waste good booze.
- It's bottom shelf.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.859
Just let me do it.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.579
How bad is it?

05:30.204 --> 05:31.998
I assume you're a fast healer?

05:34.375 --> 05:35.501
It's not that bad.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.537
We both need some sleep.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.792
Well, I can't until I figure out
what to do.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.628
He'll be there when you wake up.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.546
I meant with you.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.633
I'll still be here when you wake up.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.469
Um...

06:27.136 --> 06:28.513
For my night terrors.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.935
- I get them, too.
- Not like this.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.523
Would you help me?

06:42.568 --> 06:43.611
Well, how do I...

06:44.529 --> 06:45.530
Here.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.538
Karl usually does this for me.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.872
How romantic.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.666
I hope he's okay.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.710
I hope he gets what's coming to him.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.007
I'm sorry.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.427
I just miss him.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.730
You should try to sleep, too.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.859
You got shot today.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.035
What does this mean?

07:33.578 --> 07:34.578
Um...

07:36.998 --> 07:39.125
"Good luck" in Japanese.

07:39.709 --> 07:44.672
Yeah, one of many mistakes
by an 18-year-old me.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.468
Have you ever been to Tokyo?

07:51.345 --> 07:53.931
Between nursing school and being homeless?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.893
Mmm... Haven't really had the chance.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.814
Maybe after this we could, um...

08:05.067 --> 08:06.277
go on a trip.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.571
It's a great city.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.705
I know what you're doing, Jeri.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.500
What? I can't ruminate about the future?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.378
Like how fast you'll kick me out
the second Shane heals you?

08:27.757 --> 08:28.758
Cynical.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.553
You're a user.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.722
Takes one to know one, right?

08:43.898 --> 08:46.734
You expect me to let this go so quickly?

08:57.119 --> 08:59.038
I don't expect anything, okay?

09:20.393 --> 09:24.397
That thing about...
having your cake and eating it, too?

09:26.774 --> 09:30.444
Whoever said that probably didn't have
cake that killed people.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.870
Is this how I get my mom?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.716
Jess, I know you're in there.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.262
Jess, come on, it's me.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.396
- Jess, open up.
- All right, I'm coming.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.984
- Hey. Where have you been?
- Hey. Uh...

10:10.109 --> 10:11.110
Out.

10:11.193 --> 10:16.407
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back,
but whatever it is, can't it wait?

10:16.490 --> 10:18.326
- Did you talk to Malcolm?
- Yeah.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.953
And what did he say?

10:21.037 --> 10:24.415
He said he needed to take the day off.
He went to see his parents.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.335
Oh, good.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.463
Is that why you came over here
in the middle of the night?

10:30.546 --> 10:32.840
You don't call, I show up.
That's how it goes.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.467
Again, I'm sorry. I'm just beat.

10:34.550 --> 10:38.179
Screw sorry. Okay?
We get this close to finding the killer,

10:38.262 --> 10:40.890
and you're all,
"It's done. They're gone. Bye"?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.976
Yeah. They took off.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.980
We find them. We have passports.
I have money. We track them down.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.109
Can I just not do something
and have that be okay?

10:52.193 --> 10:54.862
Okay, this isn't some brunch
you're getting out of.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.238
People are dying.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.742
IGH doesn't have any other tracks
to cover. There are no more targets.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.870
- Except you and me.
- We won't be targets if we just drop it.

11:02.953 --> 11:06.457
They're killers! They'll kill again.
That's what killers do.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.839
What if I'm ready to move on?

11:18.594 --> 11:21.430
- Is that what you're doing?
- I don't know. Maybe.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.061
When do I get to be normal?
When do I get to have a goddamn life?

11:27.144 --> 11:29.021
After the killer's caught!

11:35.152 --> 11:36.278
Trish...

11:37.363 --> 11:38.781
are you high?

11:41.742 --> 11:42.743
Are you drunk?

11:42.827 --> 11:45.913
I'm always drunk.
But I'm not blind, and I know you.

11:45.996 --> 11:49.875
I know you. Since when do you want
anything to do with normal?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.506
- You need to call your sponsor.
- Piss off. I'm not on anything.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.799
Then I'll call your sponsor.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.385
- You don't even know who she is.
- I'll find out.

12:05.766 --> 12:09.103
- Do you have a guy here?
- Yeah, I needed the distraction.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.397
You could have told me.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.732
Wait. Trish.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.027
Give me some time.
I'll find you a meeting.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.782
Trish, wait!

12:22.533 --> 12:23.951
Trish, wait.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.329
We've been down this road before.
We know how it ends.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.623
You have to call your sponsor. Trish.

12:40.634 --> 12:41.634
Hey.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.474
Are you all right?

13:04.450 --> 13:05.784
Where is she?

13:06.827 --> 13:08.370
Where's Jessica?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.290
I'm right here.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.797
Mom, wake up!

13:26.180 --> 13:27.306
You're here.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.354
I always dream about you.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.525
Losing you over, over and over again.

13:41.737 --> 13:42.738
Same.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.453
It's okay.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.498
I'm here.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.923
Here.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.407
This... is how I get my mom.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.835
- Hey.
- Hey. Your window's broken.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.464
- There's glass on the street.
- Oh. Sorry. I'll... I'll pay for that.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.883
- What is that?
- It's a flesh wound.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.344
- Were you shot?
- Sort of.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.097
How... When did this happen?
I didn't hear any shots.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.099
The shooter used a silencer.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.102
- Jesus! Did you call the cops?
- No.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.228
Why the hell not?

15:39.146 --> 15:40.606
Because it's my mom.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.568
- Your mom shot you?
- No, she's the target. She's in trouble.

15:45.152 --> 15:48.238
- What kinda trouble?
- I don't want you involved.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.782
- I'm the super.
- So?

15:49.865 --> 15:53.661
I don't know. You're shot.
I like you. I'm involved.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.916
Look, this is a weird situation.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.795
It's... my kinda weird.

16:03.837 --> 16:04.837
Powered weird?

16:04.880 --> 16:07.091
And I got this.
You just gotta trust me, okay?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.970
- You got this.
- And this is temporary.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.683
Look, I just wanna know you're okay,
all right?

16:15.766 --> 16:17.768
You kidding me?

16:18.352 --> 16:20.229
I came to drop off Vido,
but what do you care?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.022
- Sonia, come on.
- Come on, what?

16:22.106 --> 16:24.108
Be happy you're on a bullet train
to Freaktown?

16:24.191 --> 16:27.111
- Happy you're not home to receive our son?
- It's okay, Mom.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.030
- She a bigger priority than Vido is now?
- No, she's cool.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.282
You don't know her, baby.
I don't know her.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.993
I do. And I'm his father.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.556
How could you let him be around this?

16:35.619 --> 16:37.830
Dial it back, okay?
He's fine with Jessica.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.915
You don't know what she's capable of.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.459
And I'm not going to leave him
with you if she's around.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.919
I kinda live here.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.548
Well, fine. Then Vido will live
with me full time then.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.928
- Sonia, don't be dramatic.
- You wanna see dramatic?

16:55.014 --> 16:55.889
Papi...

16:55.973 --> 16:58.517
Vido, it's okay, all right?
Papi's got you!

17:00.102 --> 17:02.479
Sorry.
She does that, like, once a week.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.897
You go deal with your family.
I'll deal with mine.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.152
We can compare notes later.

17:08.234 --> 17:09.486
You sure you're okay?

17:10.069 --> 17:11.405
Yeah, I'm okay.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.170
The drug didn't kill him.

17:27.546 --> 17:31.216
That's a step toward okay.

17:35.846 --> 17:41.810
Not okay... my best friend has relapsed,
and I'm not there for her.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.492
One man killed,
several injured after a water main burst,

17:56.575 --> 17:58.303
flooding the basement

17:58.327 --> 18:01.163
of a municipal building,
and collapsing an entire wing.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.332
Rescue teams evacuated city workers

18:03.415 --> 18:05.876
and continue to check
throughout the building.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.961
Damage to the pipe systems and buildings

18:08.045 --> 18:10.130
could cost millions in labor
and flood containment...

18:11.215 --> 18:13.467
...as well as lost revenue for businesses

18:13.550 --> 18:16.637
forced to shut down
during the restoration process...

18:20.099 --> 18:24.144
...beginning of a major overhaul
in the water delivery system.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.604
More on that in a moment.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.482
Right now, let's go
to live breaking news from Syria,

18:28.565 --> 18:30.359
brought to us by Griffin Sinclair,

18:30.442 --> 18:33.445
who's been in the war-torn region
for several weeks now.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.033
I'm reporting from
the Aleppo Citadel war zone,

18:38.117 --> 18:41.912
where Syrian forces
have launched a full-scale offensive

18:41.995 --> 18:45.707
after three days
of heavy artillery and air strikes.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.876
Just had to be the hero.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.921
Militant targets
were in the besieged areas,

18:51.004 --> 18:54.299
with previous gains
in the Sheikh Sa'eed neighborhood.

18:54.383 --> 18:58.762
Rebel forces on the ground have held
the line around their stronghold.

18:59.346 --> 19:03.016
Though it may only be
a waiting game at this point.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.965
Oh, God!

19:39.511 --> 19:40.971
I thought people who only wear black

19:41.054 --> 19:43.515
do that so they don't have to decide
what to wear.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.058
I like to have choices.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.397
- Have you ever worn yellow?
- Not in very, very a long time.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.481
To prom?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.734
Please say to prom.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.654
To a funeral, when I was eight.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.658
I like it. Yellow for death. Hmm.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.535
Black for life.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.539
How do you know Shane will do it?

20:08.123 --> 20:09.499
What if he says no?

20:09.583 --> 20:12.252
He will say no.
And then, I will persuade him.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.850
Hi. Sorry to just drop by like this,
but I need to speak to Inez.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.727
- About what?
- IGH.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.104
- It's important.
- What's happened?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.274
- I'm gonna put you on the radio.
- What?

20:34.358 --> 20:38.779
You're a witness to IGH's atrocities.
We put you on air, smoke out the killer.

20:38.862 --> 20:39.863
Take them down.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.824
Why not dangle Jessica
over the shark tank instead?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.660
She needs to keep a low profile.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.495
Forget it.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.749
We brought Inez here to keep her safe.
She is not a puppet for your crusade.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.377
Yeah, if you want a martyr,
try East 84th and Park.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.214
It's a church. She means Jesus.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.758
Well, I don't want Jesus. I want justice.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.099
Inez, they should pay
for what they did to you.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.012
She's already been through enough.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.931
Jessica should've caught
the killer by now.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.433
- We're working on it.
- Where's Jessica, then?

21:08.517 --> 21:11.144
- Okay, I'm working on it.
- More like obsessing about it.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.813
- Because it matters.
- To whom?

21:12.896 --> 21:14.856
To me. And to anyone I can save.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.609
You're gonna have to become a hero
on someone else's back.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.194
She's not going with you.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.818
What is wrong with people?

21:20.862 --> 21:24.241
Why am I the only one who is prepared
to step up and give a damn?

21:24.324 --> 21:26.326
Because the rest of us
wanna live our lives.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.745
And I'm sorry if yours isn't up to par.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.215
Hey, fancy lawyer pants.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.599
Thank God.
The smell of piss is disgusting.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.442
How long do you think he'll be out?

21:59.776 --> 22:03.322
Karl designed the tranq for me,
so I imagine it's a hefty dose.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.824
It's been all night, though.
So, he could come to any minute.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.410
Good. He'll see reason.

22:10.078 --> 22:12.331
I'm starving. We should eat.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.262
This is a sad excuse
for breakfast spaghetti,

22:27.345 --> 22:28.597
but it's edible.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.477
There's no news
about Pryce being missing yet.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.775
- It's butter and jam?
- What?

22:40.358 --> 22:41.693
You used to love this.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.571
Just eat your spaghetti.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.908
You're still a terrible cook.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.036
Some things never change.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.168
It wouldn't be like this, you know.

22:58.835 --> 23:02.672
- What?
- Us. If neither of us went to jail.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.467
Yeah, it would be hard
to keep me in check.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.846
- It would be hard without Karl.
- Well, he's gone. Get over it.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.015
He's not dead. He's out there.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.768
Well...

23:16.353 --> 23:21.358
Would it help if someone brought him
to you in a little plastic baggie?

23:21.441 --> 23:23.527
'Cause that can work wonders for closure.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.238
You kept us in a baggie?

23:26.321 --> 23:28.573
It was not you, obviously.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.243
It's probably somebody's
cremated Labradoodle.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.120
Karl thought it would help you move on.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.872
Why didn't you just get rid of them?

23:36.915 --> 23:39.126
Because that would be
letting myself off the hook.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.210
For what?

23:42.420 --> 23:44.631
The accident. What else?

23:44.714 --> 23:45.715
What?

23:49.302 --> 23:51.304
You think that was your fault?

23:52.889 --> 23:56.685
Hey. Look at me.
You did not cause that accident.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.312
Your father did.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.815
Took his eyes off the road.
He was a shitty driver.

24:01.898 --> 24:05.235
All right, throw Dad under the bus
because he's not here to defend himself.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.154
It was his fault.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.781
Jesus.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.786
This whole time
you've been blaming yourself?

24:14.870 --> 24:19.040
Okay... Look, the...

24:19.124 --> 24:22.169
That feeling you have
when you're behind the wheel of a car...

24:22.252 --> 24:25.297
You know, the speed and the control...

24:25.380 --> 24:27.799
I told you, I don't drive.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.136
I'll give you one guess why.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.763
I hate that it's ruined it for you
because I loved it.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.641
But your father,
he needed to be in charge,

24:36.725 --> 24:38.894
like his dick would fall off
if he let me drive.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.271
I so don't need to hear
about my dead father's dick.

24:41.354 --> 24:45.942
Okay, okay.
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

24:48.695 --> 24:52.407
is that if I had been driving,
we would all still be alive.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.826
So it's my fault, too.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.831
That's a great role model
for your daughter, right?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.708
"Shut up and sit shotgun."

25:02.709 --> 25:05.503
You've set worse examples.

25:05.587 --> 25:10.508
Never once did it cross my mind
that any of this is your fault.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.969
Funny. 'Cause it crossed mine
about a million times.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.938
- What are you doing?
- Closure.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.157
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

25:34.241 --> 25:37.244
Feel how you feel.
You have nothing to forgive yourself for.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.663
You're not exactly the best judge of that.

25:39.746 --> 25:40.830
I do what I have to.

25:40.914 --> 25:44.000
And the only way to live with it
is not to wallow in it.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.670
And I'd do the same with him.

25:46.753 --> 25:50.924
- Why should he live when he wants us dead?
- Because I'm not a murderer.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.008
It's self-defense.

25:52.092 --> 25:55.845
- Not if he's unconscious!
- Okay. Okay. Then...

25:57.264 --> 25:59.182
then we could run before he wakes up.

25:59.266 --> 26:03.520
You know, somewhere without extradition.
Karl and I talked about Montevideo.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.564
Why would I go anywhere with you?

26:06.189 --> 26:10.402
Because you're mine. And I'm yours.

26:11.820 --> 26:16.116
As messed up as I am,
we are the only family either of us has.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.451
So you want me to be a fugitive with you?

26:18.535 --> 26:21.037
No, I just want us to have time together.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.666
Just so we could get
to know each other again.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.211
What if he wakes up and we're just gone?

26:28.295 --> 26:30.213
What if we're gone, and we're...

26:32.632 --> 26:33.675
happy?

26:45.103 --> 26:46.104
Oscar?

26:46.771 --> 26:47.897
Sonia took Vido.

26:48.606 --> 26:49.482
What?

26:49.566 --> 26:51.860
She didn't pick up her phone,
so I came by her place.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.362
Her neighbor said she left with Vido,
carrying suitcases.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.156
Do you think she kidnapped him?

26:56.239 --> 26:57.365
What? Who's kidnapped?

26:57.449 --> 26:59.284
She's been wanting to take him to Peru.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.953
I said no, thinking
I'd never see him again if she did.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.038
Now she's gone.

27:05.582 --> 27:06.791
I need you to do what you do.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.294
Text me her address.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.465
Oscar's ex just kidnapped his kid.

27:13.548 --> 27:17.385
Jesus. Well, go and find them.
I'll stay here.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.471
I am not leaving you alone with Pryce.

27:19.554 --> 27:20.972
Then let me help.

27:50.627 --> 27:51.628
Let's go.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.511
Good luck.

28:04.432 --> 28:05.809
You ready to go?

28:05.892 --> 28:08.103
- Catch a bus.
- Get in the car, Shane.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.189
Get your own shaky ass in the car.
I didn't ask you to get me out.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.565
I gave you the gift of freedom.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.369
You don't get to keep it
unless you cure me.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.445
Well, you can't put me back in.
My lawyer says I'm free and clear.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.031
Does he know about the two assaults
you were never charged for?

28:21.366 --> 28:23.910
I dug those up
when I was securing your release.

28:26.413 --> 28:29.874
I can also have you transferred
to supermax after you're charged.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.751
Shit, lady.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.547
It takes something from me, you get that?

28:35.630 --> 28:37.173
Every time I heal someone,

28:37.882 --> 28:40.385
it's like I'm jumping toward death
instead of crawling.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.431
I just want to crawl like everybody else.

28:44.514 --> 28:48.059
Well, you can crawl in prison
if that's how you wanna spend your days.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.312
How much are your days worth?

28:52.188 --> 28:53.748
Think your time's worth more than mine?

28:53.773 --> 28:54.774
It is to me.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.946
- I need you to stop at a Chick-fil-A.
- A what?

29:00.029 --> 29:01.156
For energy.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.543
And we're back with Lila Yale,

29:13.626 --> 29:17.964
author and nutritionist of Gluten Freedom:
Going Against The Grain.

29:18.548 --> 29:22.927
We were discussing the dangers of gluten,
and I'm wondering if you can tell me

29:23.011 --> 29:26.097
how many people die each year
from celiac disease?

29:26.181 --> 29:29.350
Oh. It's not a direct cause of death.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.729
Your book says gluten
can mean life or death.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.689
I didn't mean that literally.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.317
But gluten causes inflammation
in the intestines.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.486
Not to mention autoimmune reactions

29:39.569 --> 29:41.946
even in people
who don't have celiac disease.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.533
Gluten is the silent irritant.
Doesn't get worse than that.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.286
So would you say
it's worse than, uh, gun violence?

29:48.369 --> 29:50.497
Or what's happening in Syria?

29:50.580 --> 29:53.124
Those are certainly issues,

29:53.208 --> 29:56.377
but three million Americans
are afflicted with gluten...

29:56.461 --> 29:58.755
Or sexual assault? Or cancer?

29:59.297 --> 30:02.133
Gluten sensitives suffer in other ways.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.261
Scientists have linked a gut microbe
to anxiety in the brain.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.973
Okay. All right.
You clearly care about gluten very deeply.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.059
But here's the thing.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.728
It doesn't matter.

30:14.771 --> 30:18.650
Diets. Hair volume.
Space-saving packing tips.

30:18.733 --> 30:22.987
None of it matters,
when there's war, sex trafficking,

30:23.071 --> 30:28.827
elusive companies conducting
illegal human research on kids, no less.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.371
I could go on. No, no, no, I will go on.

30:31.955 --> 30:37.126
Racism, global warming,
child pornography, murder, poverty,

30:37.210 --> 30:41.214
true human suffering
that too many people refuse to look at.

30:41.297 --> 30:44.801
Denial is a warm bed
that no one wants to get out of,

30:44.884 --> 30:48.721
and Trish Talk
is the comforter on that bed.

30:49.722 --> 30:52.016
I keep you complacent.
I keep your eyes down.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.228
But you know what? This show is bullshit.

30:55.311 --> 30:59.023
I've been spouting bullshit.
Wake up, people! Face the truth.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.733
Bad shit happens every day,

31:00.817 --> 31:04.946
and every single goddamn person
has the power to do something about it.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.448
So do something! I'm going to.

31:07.532 --> 31:12.954
Starting with throwing off the covers
and getting the hell off this shitty show.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.163
I quit.

31:14.831 --> 31:15.832
Yes!

31:25.633 --> 31:26.633
Gracias.

31:27.385 --> 31:30.221
- Hey. Is this her apartment?
- Yeah, the super wasn't home.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.431
I couldn't get a key.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.700
Do you know where
she keeps their passports?

31:40.773 --> 31:41.774
In the desk.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.082
What are you doing?

31:58.166 --> 32:02.545
Looking for receipts or notes, anything
that points to where they might've gone.

32:04.964 --> 32:05.965
It's not here.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.634
What?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.386
Captain America.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.139
Vido wouldn't go on a trip without Cap,
and Cap's gone.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.892
- Well, so are their passports.
- Shit!

32:16.351 --> 32:18.728
I just lost my kid.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.438
We're not gonna let that happen.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.482
Jessica's not gonna let that happen.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.651
We're getting him back.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.739
I should've seen this coming.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.451
We have a custody hearing in two weeks.
She's afraid she'll lose.

32:33.534 --> 32:34.814
How long have you been divorced?

32:34.869 --> 32:37.580
Almost two years.
Sonia has trouble letting go.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.248
Well, it's her family.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.994
Doesn't give her the right
to mess up her kid, though.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.132
All of these notices are past due.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.956
Sonia's never met a credit card
she can't max out.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.439
Then it might have been hard
for her to get plane tickets right away.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.211
Did you two share a credit card?

32:56.724 --> 32:58.434
We still do, for emergencies with Vido.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.353
I'll check the account.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.443
She just bought bus tickets.

33:12.198 --> 33:16.619
So $122 gets you two tickets
to either Niagara Falls or Montreal.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.205
Montreal? She's trying to get him out
of the country.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.332
There's also a border crossing
in Niagara Falls.

33:27.296 --> 33:28.631
Hey, Vido!

33:29.340 --> 33:31.509
- Do you know a bus to Niagara Falls?
- Sorry.

33:31.592 --> 33:34.387
- Try 12. That way. Yeah.
- Are you sure? Over here?

33:36.723 --> 33:39.100
Excuse me? Where's the bus to Montreal?

33:39.183 --> 33:40.309
Schedule's inside.

33:40.393 --> 33:43.438
Hey! Where's the bus to Montreal?

33:43.521 --> 33:46.149
Hey. I asked you to lay low.

33:46.232 --> 33:47.650
It's leaving now.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.355
- Hey, you two see what happened?
- Yeah.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.199
I don't know.
Your brakes must have gone off.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.902
Wow, you really don't drive, do you?

34:30.985 --> 34:33.487
That was really stupid.
Someone could've seen you.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.907
I was just following your example.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.409
- Thank you.
- He's my son!

34:40.995 --> 34:43.246
You think he's better off with you?

34:43.331 --> 34:44.331
No.

34:45.123 --> 34:48.503
I think he's better off
with a mother who isn't in prison.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.799
I got nothing left, except for him.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.719
You're his mother.
Nothing's gonna change that.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.641
I gotta get my bags.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.339
- Are you nervous?
- No. Not at all.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.655
Back at the clinic,
this didn't always work.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.783
- You know?
- I do.

36:03.077 --> 36:05.121
I just don't want you to be disappointed.

36:05.204 --> 36:10.001
Putting all my eggs in an ex-con's basket.
If they break, so be it. I'll get sicker.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.546
But I might get stronger.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.215
Whatever happens, I, uh...

36:18.092 --> 36:19.594
I hope you'll stick around.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.187
Ready?

36:41.115 --> 36:42.450
What are you doing?

36:43.242 --> 36:45.411
I'm searching.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.456
Just relax. It helps.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.189
Oh!

38:05.241 --> 38:06.701
Do you feel anything?

38:24.176 --> 38:26.488
Bloggers'll step off
if you do a mea culpa.

38:26.512 --> 38:30.016
Ian, I'm done. You know,
I don't care what the bloggers say.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.767
Anyone blogging about Trish Talk

38:31.851 --> 38:34.103
should find something better
to blog about.

38:34.186 --> 38:35.396
- Goodbye.
- Trish!

38:45.323 --> 38:47.491
- What?
- Trish Walker?

38:47.575 --> 38:49.702
- I have Ronald Garcia for you.
- Uh...

38:49.785 --> 38:52.496
Sorry. Ronald Garcia from ZCN?

38:52.580 --> 38:53.831
Yes, one moment.

38:58.377 --> 38:59.462
Ms. Walker,

38:59.545 --> 39:02.173
I was in the car and caught the end
of your radio show today.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.800
I have to say... wow!

39:04.884 --> 39:06.635
Good wow or bad wow?

39:06.719 --> 39:11.640
Great wow. You were so brutal,
your honesty, you totally blew me away.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.924
I never would've expected
that kind of passion from you.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.728
Well, you should get to know me better.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.480
Exactly what I thought.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.106
First, I wanna ask you something.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.485
Can you do what you did today
every day on live TV?

39:23.903 --> 39:26.238
You mean on ZCN?

39:26.322 --> 39:28.741
Can we get you in tomorrow
to test?

39:28.824 --> 39:30.201
Yes! Sure.

39:30.284 --> 39:33.204
Awesome. My assistant will be in touch
with the times.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.582
That was really something today.
Really powerful stuff.

39:36.665 --> 39:39.293
Whatever spark made you do
what you did, hold on to it.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.630
I will. Um, see you tomorrow.

39:48.511 --> 39:49.845
Ooh.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.351
Jessica...

40:42.106 --> 40:43.232
Are you okay?

40:43.774 --> 40:45.151
I saw your mom.

40:46.652 --> 40:47.945
She's like you.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.367
In some ways more than others.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.202
Whatever trouble she's in,

40:56.036 --> 40:58.622
all I know is that she helped me
get my kid back.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.876
If you need something...

41:02.877 --> 41:04.420
Papers to get her out...

41:06.589 --> 41:07.631
Anything.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.161
- I make you nervous.
- Around Oscar? Yeah.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.998
Because the last boyfriend you met,
you killed in an alley.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.877
I don't wanna hurt you again.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.421
Well, that's the thing.
You're not exactly in control of that.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.636
I get it.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.224
Why you couldn't be around me.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.354
Why you gave me up.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.900
There is a lot I can't forgive,
but that...

42:11.320 --> 42:12.321
I get it.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.881
What we did today for that boy...

42:32.716 --> 42:36.595
All this time, I've been
repressing my strength, hiding it.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.597
But what if we used it?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.559
I could do something.

42:57.157 --> 42:59.368
Time to talk some sense into a shark.

42:59.451 --> 43:03.038
No amount of sense will make him stop.
Let me protect us.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.832
I don't need your protection.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.166
I'll lose you again.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.876
I can convince him.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.963
Or we could eliminate the threat.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.166
You get that, don't you?
You've had to do this before.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.383
That was different.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.927
Kilgrave was a threat to everyone.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.597
But you did what you had to do.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.725
This time,
you just have to walk out the door.

43:22.808 --> 43:25.185
You don't have to see what happens next.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.230
I can do it right.
I can knock him out again.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.941
It would be completely humane.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.321
Even if I could control you...

43:37.990 --> 43:39.491
I could never change you.

43:39.575 --> 43:42.244
Who doesn't wish they could change
something about their mother?

43:42.328 --> 43:43.579
So that's what you would do?

43:44.121 --> 43:46.123
If I wasn't here, you would kill him.

43:56.008 --> 43:57.760
Do you remember trying to kill us?

43:58.344 --> 43:59.345
Just her.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.436
Come on, let's go. Come on.

44:08.687 --> 44:09.730
Stay out of here.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.819
Get me out of this.
Why the hell am I all wet?

44:15.903 --> 44:18.489
- 'Cause you pissed yourself.
- Christ.

44:19.698 --> 44:21.617
How much of that drug did you give me?

44:21.700 --> 44:23.786
You could go away for attempted murder.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.245
I'd be a hero for it.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.538
In prison.

44:27.873 --> 44:31.794
Or we can overlook
this light kidnapping situation

44:31.877 --> 44:32.795
and call it a day.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.463
"Light kidnapping"?

44:34.546 --> 44:36.715
You shot me. I think we're even.

44:38.926 --> 44:39.927
All right.

44:50.562 --> 44:51.688
Mom's another story.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.484
Are you just gonna let
that thing out in the world?

44:56.318 --> 44:59.530
- That thing is my mother.
- She ripped my friend apart.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.533
- He had kids.
- I know.

45:02.616 --> 45:05.077
She's a murderer.
You can't change that instinct.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.996
Not even with a sniper rifle.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.124
I didn't want any cops to die.

45:10.666 --> 45:11.875
That's why I did it.

45:13.502 --> 45:14.878
She's gotta be stopped.

45:17.381 --> 45:18.632
I know you know that.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.654
Detective Costa?

45:43.449 --> 45:45.534
Are you anywhere near my apartment?

45:50.747 --> 45:51.915
The killer is here.

45:57.629 --> 45:58.630
No!

46:06.597 --> 46:07.597
Run!

46:24.406 --> 46:25.699
Mom.

46:41.423 --> 46:42.549
Mom.

47:00.108 --> 47:01.708
Hands where we can see them!

47:04.029 --> 47:05.781
Units, be advised,

47:05.864 --> 47:10.077
suspect is a possible powered human.
Be advised, possibly powered human.

47:14.039 --> 47:15.249
Miss, stay back!

47:16.208 --> 47:17.834
Hands above your head! Now!

47:17.918 --> 47:18.919
Mom.

47:19.753 --> 47:20.837
Put 'em up!

47:22.256 --> 47:23.256
Please.

47:27.511 --> 47:28.512
No more.

47:31.306 --> 47:33.100
One last time! Raise 'em!

47:33.183 --> 47:34.601
Do it, now!

47:36.728 --> 47:40.607
Hands on your head!
Slowly put your hands on your head!

47:44.778 --> 47:46.697
I'm like my mother in one way.

47:49.366 --> 47:50.909
Neither of us get a happy ending.

47:54.955 --> 47:58.584
This... is how I lose my mom.
