Great. Nicejob.
Now you’re just
getting us more stuck.

This is your fault.
You were yelling at me.

00:13.723 --> 00:16.180
That’s why you weren’t
looking at the road.
How is that my fault?

00:16.267 --> 00:19.179
See? Right there.
You’re doing exactly
what Dr. Wiseman said.

You’re deflecting.
Nothing is ever your fault.

of all that is holy,

just have one page

10:30.047 --> 10:31.708
So, I get it.
Not a pretty picture.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.710
No. But now | get
the woman’s touch, you know?

10:33.801 --> 10:37.339
A full set of silverware, ottoman,
something called a duvet.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.670
I always thought that
men hated all that stuff.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.471
Are you kidding me?
No, we love it.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.640
When we miss
living like pigs,
we go camping.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.307
I’ll have to remember that.
Yeah.

10:47.397 --> 10:51.731
| wish you and Ms. Wick
much happiness
with your new towels.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.607
How could you not
be happy with these?
Feel this one. Feel it.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.609
Okay. Oh!

10:58.700 --> 10:59.780
Okay, this is nice.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.446
Right?
Nice.

11:01.537 --> 11:02.947
Yeah. Hey.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.654
Question— Is it hard for women
moving in with a man?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.285
Is that why you said
I’d hate this?

11:07.376 --> 11:09.867
Oh, no need to get
all shrinky, Dr. Sweets.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.248
Sorry. Never mind.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.130
But, actually, um,

11:16.218 --> 11:19.460
when I moved in
with Michelle’s father,

11:19.555 --> 11:22.342
there were times
that I didn’t want
to compromise, I think.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.388
Sort of like I missed
my old ratty towels.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.636
Mmm.
But I didn’t have these.
These are awesome.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.563
They are. Can’t wait
till Daisy shows me
under the medio—cam.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.525
I’ll bet.
[ Chuckles ]

11:34.611 --> 11:36.693
Well, I should
get back to work.

11:36.822 --> 11:40.280
Enjoy.
lwill. Thank you.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.533
Well,
not much here, Bones.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.239
Hodgins says that two days
before the victim died,

11:49.334 --> 11:52.041
this area was home
to cotton candy,

11:52.129 --> 11:55.337
uh, shotgun pellets,
camels and this gravel,

11:55.424 --> 11:57.039
so I’m confident
this is the place.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.249
Shotgun pellets?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.800
Yeah. Gun show two days
before the antique show.

12:00.888 --> 12:04.426
You know, this would
be an excellent venue
for a political rally.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.929
I don’t know, Bones.
It’d be kind of embarrassing if
the turnout wasn’t too strong.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.437
Oh, it’d be strong.
[ Chuckles ]

12:09.563 --> 12:11.224
Okay.
Don’t you worry
about it being strong.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.522
— [ Man ] Two workers.
- [Crowd Clamoring ]

12:13.609 --> 12:16.772
Okay. Okay.
Uh, you and you.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.729
That’s all I need today, guys.
Hey. Hey, come on, guys.
I’m sorry.

12:19.823 --> 12:23.611
Just come back
in a couple of days
before the car show, okay?

12:23.702 --> 12:26.694
Come on!
Okay, you two.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.450
Okay, start over there.
Work your way back here,
okay?

12:29.541 --> 12:30.781
Thanks, Juan.
You got it.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.412
Yeah, no worries.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.208
Hey.
Hi.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.584
[ Sighs ]
Well, something tells me
you two aren’t here...

12:37.674 --> 12:39.630
looking to pick up
some unskilled labor.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.754
No, no, we are both
extremely skilled.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.676
Very skilled.
F.B.l.—skilled, pal.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.756
You’re looking to see
if I’m hiring illegals?
Because I’m not.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.933
These are all people
who lost theirjobs, you know?
Legal citizens.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.848
Tough times.
Some days, I think...

12:51.939 --> 12:54.271
I’m gonna get mobbed for
minimum—wage work, man.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.144
Under my administration,
the private sector...

12:56.234 --> 12:58.725
will receive incentives
to increase hiring.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.187
Bones, let’s just— No campaigning
while we’re doing the investigation, okay?

13:02.282 --> 13:06.776
Okay. We think that one of
your minimum—wage workers
might have been killed.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.031
Wow, man. Who?

13:09.122 --> 13:12.159
- I don’t know.
You missing anyone?
— It’s a pretty fluid bunch.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.956
l’m their last resort,
you know?

13:14.044 --> 13:15.955
Do you recognize
any of these men?

13:16.046 --> 13:17.957
[Juan]
Uh—

13:18.048 --> 13:19.458
That one could
be Jared.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.791
— Jared?
— Jared, uh, Andrews.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.423
No, no, um—
Jared Drew.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.635
Jared Drew.
Mm—hmm.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.384
Okay. Tell us about Mr. Drew.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.309
He’s been coming around
for a year or so.
Good worker.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.387
Never complained.
Always looking for more.

13:34.481 --> 13:38.144
Sometimes intense competition
for limited resources
results in violence.

13:38.235 --> 13:41.147
- What?
- What she means
is minimum—wage workers—

13:41.238 --> 13:44.321
I mean, any of them likely
to go after the competition?

13:44.408 --> 13:46.114
Wait, wait—
Jared was murdered?

13:46.201 --> 13:47.065
Yeah.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.406
[Sighs]
Wow. Uh—

13:50.497 --> 13:52.533
I don’t know.
I mean, uh, maybe.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.740
Yeah, the thing is, I don’t really
get to know these guys.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.791
Because they are below you
on the social scale.

13:56.878 --> 14:00.245
No. Wait a second there.
I feel bad sending them away.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.673
| get to know them as people,
and that’s why I feel bad.

14:05.387 --> 14:09.050
I mean, look at them.
I only have work for two.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.756
What about all
the other guys?

14:20.152 --> 14:23.110
[ Booth ]
The victim’s name is Jared Drew.
He was a day laborer.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.479
He used to have
his own business?
Yeah, owned a hardware store.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.316
Wow. He lost everything
in the crash.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.993
Suddenly he’s competing
for minimum-wage,
unskilled jobs.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.492
Bones and ljust got back
from the fairgrounds.
You should have seen this.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.916
There were 20 workers
raising their hands
for two jobs...

14:38.003 --> 14:40.039
to pick trash— garbage.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.917
Does Dr. Brennan
have a plan for the economy?

14:43.008 --> 14:44.748
Okay, tell you what, Sweets.
Let’s not encourage her.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.754
I don’t know.
You know, she’s very smart.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.676
Maybe she’s exactly
what this country needs.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.254
Oh, yeah, ’cause
she was wanted for murder,

14:50.348 --> 14:52.760
she took peyote with the Indians
and her dad was a hard—core criminal.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.432
I don’t think
I should start printing up...

14:54.561 --> 14:57.268
“Bones for President”
campaign buttons any time soon.
[Cell Phone Chimes]

14:57.355 --> 14:59.641
[ Chuckles ]

15:02.152 --> 15:05.644
lt’s Daisy.
She’s smiling and looking happy.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.900
— What’s the big deal?
— We’re moving in together.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.858
She’s, uh— She’s putting together
a little celebration.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.485
Sweets, the case.
Victim—
Mm—hmm.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.743
All right,
has no criminal record,
but check this out, huh?

15:16.833 --> 15:18.334
Right there.

15:19.920 --> 15:24.880
Restraining order filed two days
before the murder by Marcy Drew?

15:24.966 --> 15:26.922
His ex—wife.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.717
How is your reconstruction
coming, Ms. Wick?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.594
I hope you’ll be pleased,
Madam President.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.554
“Dr. Brennan” is fine.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.935
For now.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.982
I found arthritic markers
on his knuckles and wrists...

15:45.070 --> 15:46.901
that predate
the gunshot wound.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.855
It’s in the nascent stages and...

15:51.785 --> 15:53.070
asymmetrical.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.369
A day laborer should present
symmetrical wear to his joints.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.663
There are over a hundred types
of arthritis, Ms. Wick.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.288
l’ll examine the cell structure
to see what we’re dealing with.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.915
How will you deal
with the CIA?

16:04.005 --> 16:06.667
That would be a problem for me.
I can’t keep a secret.

16:06.758 --> 16:10.046
You must realize
that espionage
is a crucial tool...

16:10.137 --> 16:12.970
for diplomacy
as well as national defense.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.217
But you wouldn’t tap
my phone or anything.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.927
A campaign must be
designed to persuade
the electorate...

16:20.021 --> 16:21.477
that the candidate
is on their side.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.682
Which means
it is sometimes
necessary to lie.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.152
So my answer is—

16:26.236 --> 16:29.148
No, I would not
tap your phone.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.605
Oh.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.282
You did an excellentjob
of reconstructing the skull,
Ms. Wick.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.609
I know.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.990
And it seems as if we have
cause of death— because of me.

16:38.081 --> 16:41.744
Chiseling shows
the bullet path was
through the frontal sinus...

16:41.835 --> 16:45.123
and exited through the right
superolateral occipital.

16:45.213 --> 16:50.003
The entry wound
and surrounding damage
measure 1.828 centimeters.

16:50.093 --> 16:53.506
That would suggest
a .45—caliber bullet.

16:53.597 --> 16:56.930
But Dr. Saroyan said that
the gunshot to the hand...

16:57.017 --> 16:59.053
was probably from
a nine—millimeter.

16:59.144 --> 17:03.262
Two guns,
which means we’re likely
looking for two killers.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.184
This is terrible.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.611
I never wanted
anything like this
to happen to Jared.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.484
But you did file
a restraining order
against him.

17:13.575 --> 17:17.238
He was coming around all the time.
He wouldn’t leave Marcy alone.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.160
You were listed in
the restraining order
as well, Mr. Young.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.369
Yeah.
Okay.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.163
Jared was getting aggressive.
That had to stop.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.865
I don’t think that Jared
would have hurt us, Mike.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.451
You want to take
a chance like that? Huh?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.162
Preemptive action.
You can never go wrong with
a little preemptive action.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.997
You seem angry.

17:31.092 --> 17:34.459
Jared was coming around
all the time begging me
to take him back.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.887
Marcy’s with me now. Okay?
I’m taking care of her.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.966
I’m taking care of the kids. All right?
Jared’s life with her is over.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.767
Certainly is now.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.475
Was he ever violent
with you or the children?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.558
Jared? Oh, God, no, no.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.894
- No, he was just—
— He was a loser.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.819
He upset the kids.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.570
That hardware store
was passed down
from Jared’s grandfather.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.492
And—And trying
to hang on to it,

17:59.579 --> 18:02.412
we lost our condo
and every penny we had.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.161
— He couldn’t find any work?
— He tried to get on...

18:05.252 --> 18:08.085
with one of the big
home improvement stores, but—

18:08.171 --> 18:10.412
He would have had to
move away from the kids.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.214
And since you and Mike here
were already together—

18:13.301 --> 18:16.008
— Who told you that?
— Uh, you did, just now.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.305
— Obviously, you feel guilty
about leaving your husband.
- Ex-husband.

18:20.392 --> 18:25.182
He was a good man.
He was a good provider
until he lost that store.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.604
I had to think of my kids.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.932
Right. You know, often, though,
people feel the need...

18:30.026 --> 18:32.984
to get rid of whatever it is
that makes them feel guilty.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.027
No, that’s not it.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.064
Do either of you own a gun?

18:39.369 --> 18:42.156
— I would like a lawyer.
— Me too.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.203
Not another word
without a lawyer.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.913
Dr. Saroyan,
have you seen the excrement
that I left on my desk?

18:53.008 --> 18:54.873
[ Groans ]
Think before you speak,
Hodgins.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.004
Some people might
not understand what
you’re referring to.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.177
Oh. That’s a good point.
So, have you seen it?

18:59.264 --> 19:02.006
Yes, I took your excrement.
I wanted to study it.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.432
Ooh. Now everything
sounds terrible,
doesn’t it?

19:04.519 --> 19:07.386
- Awful.
- I wasn’t finished
cataloging what the animal ate.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.847
You’ll have plenty of time.
I wanted to get my hands
on the ex—

19:10.942 --> 19:13.479
evidence to see if it
contained epithelial cells.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.652
Apparently,
she hit the mother lode.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.822
The epithelial cells
came from a variety
of exotic animals.

19:18.908 --> 19:23.493
So far, I’ve found
monkey cells, cougar
and digested wolf cells.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.946
Yeah, and all the animals
were at a pet expo.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.827
Jared Drew
had work there,

19:27.917 --> 19:30.249
mucking out
the, uh, holding pens.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.465
[ Saroyan ]
Have your bugs given you
time of death yet?

19:37.594 --> 19:41.007
Yeah, six days ago.
Oh, that was during
the pet expo.

19:41.097 --> 19:44.555
This must have been
his lastjob.
[Hodgins ] Oh, man.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.972
[ Saroyan ] Turns out
these expos aren’t just
for puppies and kittens anymore.

19:48.063 --> 19:52.272
- Exotic pets are a
$10 billion-a-year industry.
— You’re exaggerating, right?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.270
No, there are more
pet tigers in Texas...

19:54.361 --> 19:56.397
than there are
in the wilds of India.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.355
What kind of lunatic wants
a wild animal as a pet?

19:59.449 --> 20:02.737
I think “lunatic”
pretty much describes
who we’re talking about.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.707
I’m sorry.
I don’t know him.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.375
— He worked at your pet expo.
— Doing what?

20:12.462 --> 20:14.544
— Cleaning up.
— Oh, I don’t hire the day laborers.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.838
- The fairground does that.
- What kind of people
come to these things?

20:16.925 --> 20:20.793
Oh, awful people really.
Families, retired people.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.673
Antique shows,
they draw stolen goods.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.925
Gun shows
draw illegal weapons.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.348
Okay, yeah, I can see
where this is going.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.472
We don’t do any traffic
iniHegalexoﬂcs.

20:30.563 --> 20:35.307
My pet expo is not only
in compliance with
every local and federal law,

20:35.402 --> 20:39.020
but it is also approved
by eight animal rights
organizations.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.570
It is a family event.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.273
No, cougars and bears
are not for families.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.986
They are legal.
The vendors breed them
right here in the US.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.820
Nothing illegal about it.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.952
These animals
aren’t domesticated.
It is cruel to treat them as pets.

20:52.043 --> 20:54.079
Well, some would say
that it’s horrible...

20:54.170 --> 20:56.582
to watch a lion
taking down a zebra,

20:56.673 --> 20:58.834
tearing it apart
and eating it.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.461
These animals
are spared that fate.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.463
Look, I came here to help,
not to be attacked...

21:02.554 --> 21:04.135
for doing something
perfectly legal.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.803
All right,
simmer down, Bwana Bob.

21:05.890 --> 21:09.382
l comply with the law.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.560
Now, is there anything else, or do you
just intend to berate me...

21:12.647 --> 21:14.683
because we see the world differently?

21:23.074 --> 21:25.736
[ Daisy]
I believe you’ll be very
impressed when I tell you...

21:25.827 --> 21:28.239
that this arthritis
isn’t really arthritis.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.492
I’d be more impressed
if you told me what it is
instead of what it isn’t.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.325
Beginning stages
of osteonecrosis.
See here?

21:34.419 --> 21:37.035
On the ulna
at the styloid process?

21:37.130 --> 21:41.373
And here, more damage
at the olecranon process.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.798
— What causes that?
Blood poisoning?
— Exactly.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.971
And when sepsis
makes its way into bone,

21:48.057 --> 21:50.184
it presents as septic arthritis.

21:50.268 --> 21:54.102
- What caused
the blood poisoning?
— Point of entry was here.

21:54.189 --> 21:57.477
See the linear striations
on the victim’s right
lunate and trapezium?

21:57.567 --> 21:59.808
Ouch. Those cuts are pretty deep,

21:59.903 --> 22:02.485
almost like he was slashed.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.528
Scratching the victim
down to bone...

22:04.616 --> 22:07.904
and inserting the bacteria directly
into the victim’s bloodstream.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.782
What kind of person
doesn’t go to the hospital
after an injury like that?

22:11.873 --> 22:14.785
- A very poor person?
— He could’ve gone to
the emergency room.

22:14.876 --> 22:18.368
Either he couldn’t
get to a hospital,
or he was prevented.

22:18.463 --> 22:22.957
Let’s see if Hodgins
can take some samples
and figure out what slashed him.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.885
I’m just saying that you’re
more important in the lab than I am.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.351
Is this some kind of test?

22:32.435 --> 22:34.642
I give them faces,
which, more and more,

22:34.729 --> 22:36.435
is just not the way
to identify victims.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.105
And then, sometimes,
I show how they died.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.433
That is very important,
Angie.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.941
God help me, if you get
into that “All boats rise
in a flood” thing—

22:45.031 --> 22:46.987
— “High tide raises all boats.”
— Yeah. What?

22:47.075 --> 22:49.908
You said flood. A flood
is a natural disaster.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.950
What? Most boats would
sink in a flood.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.323
Tide’s good, flood’s bad.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.037
Seriously?
Ask New Orleans.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.830
I’m telling you that
I’m feeling inadequate.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.372
[Cell Phone Rings]
And you’re talking about boats.
It’s totally—

22:59.504 --> 23:03.042
Hey, Sweets.
Hey. Come here.
Hey.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.380
Save Hodgins’s life.
Hey.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.425
Uh, don’t you want
to finish your—

23:09.264 --> 23:10.424
your fight?

23:10.515 --> 23:12.631
Whoa, Sweets thinks
we were having a fight.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.386
He clearly doesn’t know
what a fight is.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.139
I gotta go. I’m gonna figure
out how our victim’s hand
got slashed. I love you.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.437
Hey. Sit down.

23:20.775 --> 23:21.764
[Sighs]

23:21.859 --> 23:23.360
Are you okay?

23:23.444 --> 23:25.184
Yeah. Why?

23:25.280 --> 23:28.067
If I were a psychologist,
I’d say that you overreacted...

23:28.157 --> 23:30.864
to the slightest disagreement
between me and Hodgins.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.489
Because I’m at a turning point
in my own relationship.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.823
l was gonna say that
maybe you’re nervous
about moving in with Daisy.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.125
No. Um— Yeah, well,
I’m a little nervous.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.588
You’re getting cold feet.

23:42.672 --> 23:45.084
No! Why would I?

23:45.174 --> 23:47.586
lt’s— It’s not like
we’re getting married.

23:47.677 --> 23:50.510
Moving in together is—is—
You know, it’s
a minor commitment.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.053
Minor.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.046
Oh, boy.
What?

23:54.142 --> 23:58.101
Is it possible that
maybe what you’re seeing
as a minor commitment...

23:58.187 --> 24:00.178
Daisy is seeing as—

24:00.273 --> 24:02.639
The beginning of
a whole new life together.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.396
Yeah.
Yeah.

24:05.486 --> 24:08.444
It’s like you never studied
psychology at all.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.692
Yeah.

24:12.619 --> 24:16.157
— [ Saroyan ]
You found something?
- Yeah. Keratin.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.704
[ Saroyan ]
From a claw?
Feline.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.950
He was slashed by a cat?
Yeah, but not the kind
that you’re thinkin’.

24:22.045 --> 24:24.411
Don’t be so sure.

24:24.505 --> 24:27.747
D.N.A. results from
the epithelial cells you found
in the victim’s boot tread.

24:27.842 --> 24:31.005
Okay, if you say tiger,
then we are on the same page.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.472
[ Saroyan ]
A Siberian tiger.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.888
Wait— a purebred
Siberian tiger?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.557
According to the DNA.
Does the type of tiger
make a difference?

24:38.645 --> 24:41.352
Yeah. See, buying and selling
crossbred tigers is legal.

24:41.439 --> 24:44.602
But a purebred
Siberian tiger,

24:44.692 --> 24:46.432
I mean, that’s— that’s a felony.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.063
Definitely motive for murder.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.645
Well, it’s only murder
if we can find cause of death.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.653
I found cause of death.
I should’ve seen this earlier.
I was a coroner in New York.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.109
Wait. Seen what earlier?

24:56.204 --> 24:57.910
Dr. Brennan said that
the splintering showed...

24:57.997 --> 25:00.374
that the bullet entered
through the palm and exited
through the back of the hand.

25:00.458 --> 25:01.413
Yeah?

25:02.919 --> 25:05.126
— Shoot me.
— I beg your pardon?

25:05.213 --> 25:06.749
No— with the marker.
Shoot me.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.923
Um— Okay, bang—

25:11.010 --> 25:12.841
It was a defensive wound.

25:12.929 --> 25:16.262
The bullet went through
the victim’s hand
and then into his face.

25:16.349 --> 25:19.056
A hollow—point bullet.
ltexpanded
entering the hand.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.850
That’s why we thought
a nine—millimeter
entered his hand...

25:21.938 --> 25:24.179
and a .45—caliber
entered his face.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.765
One bullet, one gun,
one shooter.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.535
Our victim was attacked by
a purebred Siberian tiger.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.827
The wounds he sustained
gave him blood poisoning,

25:39.914 --> 25:41.996
but he did not seek
medical help— Why?

25:42.083 --> 25:43.664
That’s what
I’m asking you.

25:43.751 --> 25:47.664
Because if he tells the hospital
that he was attacked
by a Siberian tiger,

25:47.755 --> 25:49.837
he ends up in prison, right?

25:49.924 --> 25:52.540
Okay, the body was found here,
on the north side of the road.

25:52.635 --> 25:55.672
— The road dead—ends in this valley.
— There’s five farms there.

25:55.763 --> 25:58.971
So, if the body was found
on the north side of the road,
he was heading out.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.390
— After delivering the tiger.
— Right.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.810
Okay, so maybe
the buyer of the tiger
sees the victim’s wound,

26:04.897 --> 26:06.603
realizes he’s gonna
have to go to the hospital—

26:06.691 --> 26:08.227
No,no.No,no,
that’s too risky, okay?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.353
Buying a tiger is a felony, Sweets.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.356
Right, right, so, maybe...

26:12.447 --> 26:14.813
the buyer offers to drive
the victim to the hospital,

26:14.907 --> 26:17.819
kills him along this
deserted stretch of road.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.571
You should search
those five farms for a tiger.

26:19.662 --> 26:22.529
I don’t have enough
for a warrant, okay?
That’s why you’re here.

26:22.665 --> 26:24.496
I don’t understand.
I need you to
put together...

26:24.584 --> 26:28.452
some kind of psychological
mumbo jumbo warrant
for these five farmers.

26:28.546 --> 26:31.538
Booth, I’m a professional, okay?
I can’t just make things up
so you can get a warrant.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.623
You’re not helping me.
You—You—You’re not.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.676
Wouldn’t it make more sense
if I talked to the guy
that runs the pet expo?

26:36.763 --> 26:40.051
I mean, maybe one of these
farmers is known to be
an animal collector.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.506
— That’s a good idea.
— Thank you.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.262
You know what? He’s in
the interrogation room, okay?

26:43.352 --> 26:45.934
You have at him
right now.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.105
You just— You just totally
conned me into doing that.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.773
— Booth!
- Yeah.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.600
Can I ask you
a personal question?

26:52.695 --> 26:54.560
Well, that depends
how personal here.

26:54.655 --> 26:58.819
Okay, um, was it a big deal
for you to move in
with Dr. Brennan?

26:58.951 --> 27:02.159
What do you mean?
You know, big deal,
like... getting married.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.498
Whoa— Living together is
not getting married, okay?

27:04.582 --> 27:06.163
Getting married’s
a big—boy commitment.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.492
Okay, yes, yes.
I totally agree with that.

27:09.587 --> 27:12.624
For me. But, for Bones,
that was a—

27:12.715 --> 27:16.378
That was a huge step, you know?
Living together.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.677
The only reason
she even considered it was
because she was pregnant.

27:19.764 --> 27:25.009
Okay, so...
Dr. Brennan’s the most rational
human being on the planet.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.261
And, to her,
moving in together—
Big deal.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.012
Big.
Huge.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.640
Huge.
[Laughs]
Huge.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.271
Breathe it out, kid.
You’ll get him.

27:34.362 --> 27:36.148
Okay.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.987
None of these names
mean anything to me.
Who—Who are they?

27:46.082 --> 27:49.290
We have reason to believe that
one of them bought a Siberian
tiger on the black market.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.038
Oh, here we go again.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.744
Mr. Neibling,
the victim worked
at the fairgrounds...

27:53.840 --> 27:55.626
during the time
of your pet exposition,
all right?

27:55.716 --> 27:57.547
He was injured by
a Siberian tiger.

27:57.635 --> 28:01.093
Maybe one of these—
One of these farmers
made suspicious inquiries.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.512
10,000 people
came through that expo.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.635
We had over 200 exhibitors.

28:05.726 --> 28:09.435
An innocent man is dead.
We’re just exploring
every avenue.

28:09.522 --> 28:13.481
If he was transporting
a purebred Siberian tiger,
then he was not innocent.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.058
Okay, but he didn’t
deserve to die.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.696
See, I’m not sure
I agree with that.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.192
These smugglers, they don’t
care about the animals,

28:20.283 --> 28:22.399
and they interfere
with my legitimate business.

28:22.493 --> 28:25.656
Now, what happens
if the press finds out
that you’re questioning me?

28:25.746 --> 28:27.657
My reputation goes
right into the toilet.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.579
We won’t leak your name
to the press.

28:31.878 --> 28:35.541
All right, well,
let me take the names.
I’ll ask around.

28:35.673 --> 28:38.631
lfl hear anything suspicious,
I’ll get back to you.
Good. Thank you, sir.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.504
I appreciate your help.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.888
I love farms.
Someday, Lance and I
will have a farm of our own.

28:45.975 --> 28:49.513
The pet expo guys
didn’t recognize any
of the farmers’ names.

28:49.604 --> 28:52.516
Yeah, but what are the chances
that a guy is gonna buy
a Siberian tiger...

28:52.607 --> 28:54.143
with his real name anyway?

28:54.233 --> 28:58.943
Oh! Oh! I could call in
an anonymous tip like—
I hear roaring at night.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.942
I was thinking along the lines
of looking at satellite photos
on the Internet,

29:02.033 --> 29:04.240
and seeing if any of the farms
shout “tiger.”

29:04.327 --> 29:07.660
— That is brilliant.
— Okay, here they are.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.707
[ Saroyan ]
Kind of grainy.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.248
This is just what
the government allows us
to see on the Internet.

29:13.336 --> 29:15.076
You know they keep all
the good stuff for themselves.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.036
Could those be
endangered animals?

29:17.131 --> 29:18.712
Are blobs endangered?

29:18.799 --> 29:20.926
Let me try a fractal
enlargement program.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.966
[ Saroyan ]
I’m guessing cows.

29:23.054 --> 29:26.842
Pigs! Which are not endangered.
Unless you factor in bacon.

29:26.933 --> 29:31.142
- Are those cages?
- Yeah, they could be.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.139
“Could be” will not
get us a warrant.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.687
Yeah, and these images haven’t
been updated in over a year.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.640
What we need is our own satellite.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.734
Oh, we’ve got one!

29:44.075 --> 29:47.283
All of Neibling’s permits
are up to date.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.076
There’s no citations,
no violations.

29:49.163 --> 29:51.449
He even got an “A” rating from
the Better Business Bureau.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.076
Legality notwithstanding,

29:53.167 --> 29:55.954
why would someone willingly
keep these animals as pets?

29:56.045 --> 29:58.457
People who live where these
creatures are indigenous...

29:58.547 --> 30:01.505
take great lengths
to keep these animals
away from their homes.

30:01.592 --> 30:04.174
Look, I’m with you, man.
You want to see a wild
animal, go to the zoo.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.636
Oh, I do not like zoos.
What do you mean?
It’s a zoo.

30:07.723 --> 30:11.056
Keeping animals captive
for human entertainment
is just wrong.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.804
Come on!
Don’t ruin the zoo
for me.

30:12.895 --> 30:15.102
I used to go with Pops.
I have great memories
there.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.893
I can’t wait to take Christine.
No, that will not
be happening.

30:17.984 --> 30:21.772
It’s educational, okay? If she
doesn’t go to the zoo, how’s she
gonna learn about the animals?

30:21.862 --> 30:23.648
The satellite system
you insisted that we buy...

30:23.739 --> 30:27.231
provides us with
16 animal—themed channels.

30:27.368 --> 30:30.075
One just for penguins.
It’s not the same, okay?

30:30.162 --> 30:31.993
The TV won’t

41:32.908 --> 41:35.320
Uh, no, I don’t.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.573
You know, you’re an atheist,
you’re not diplomatic, and you
think America is an empire.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.120
America Is an empire.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.823
I really wouldn’t
give you your own army
or nuclear weapons.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.408
That would just be a disaster.

41:44.503 --> 41:47.461
— Because I’m like a tiger?
— Excuse me?

41:47.547 --> 41:50.914
Earlier today, you said
I reminded you of a wild tiger.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.840
I did. You do.

41:52.928 --> 41:56.261
You called me
rare and beautiful.
Like a tiger, you said.

41:56.348 --> 41:58.009
I thought you didn’t hear.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.887
Wild tigers do not
have the qualities
of a good president.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.889
[ Sighs ]
You know what, Bones?
[ Inhales ]

42:03.980 --> 42:09.600
I wouldn’t vote for you,
but I would definitely encourage
other people to vote for you.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.902
[Laughs]

42:11.988 --> 42:14.650
Yeah, well,
so is politics and love.

42:14.741 --> 42:15.730
[ Buttons Rattling ]

42:15.826 --> 42:18.192
I think you were
trying to convey...

42:18.286 --> 42:20.948
that you no longer would like
to discuss politics.

42:21.081 --> 42:25.324
Unless we’re talking
about JFK. and Marilyn Monroe.
[ Imitates Roar]

42:25.419 --> 42:28.081
[Laughs]
Booth, what are you doing?

42:28.213 --> 42:29.714
Where are you going?
Bones!

42:29.798 --> 42:31.584
[Brennan Laughing]

43:05.792 --> 43:07.168
What’s that mean?
