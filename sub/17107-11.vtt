TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.360 --> 00:06.799
-Sir Jeffrey has a list of
who fits his vision.

00:06.839 --> 00:09.400
He starts it when you enter
first year and then he revises

00:09.439 --> 00:12.119
it for injury or change
of body shape.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.320
-That--that-- that's enough.

00:13.359 --> 00:14.279
[crack]

00:14.320 --> 00:15.240
[groan]

00:15.279 --> 00:16.359
-She's fine.

00:16.399 --> 00:18.399
My teachers did that
to me all the time.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.239
-I have managed to lure
back one of the

00:20.280 --> 00:21.519
company's leading lights.

00:21.559 --> 00:23.480
[applause]

00:23.519 --> 00:25.839
-I'm just sick of it.

00:25.879 --> 00:27.640
I keep thinking, when is
this going to stop?

00:27.679 --> 00:31.399
Because I want so much
to be rid of you.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.320
[theme music]

01:16.400 --> 01:17.680
TARA NARRATING: We're definitely
reaching a point

01:17.719 --> 01:18.680
here end of the year.

01:18.719 --> 01:21.400
I think everyone's
feeling that.

01:21.439 --> 01:22.439
Change--

01:22.480 --> 01:25.480
it's, like, lurking
everywhere.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.599
-I said, I think we should
be together.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.560
-Yeah, I--

01:29.599 --> 01:30.560
I got that part.

01:30.599 --> 01:33.200
Um, why?

01:33.239 --> 01:35.680
-You told me once that I have
to figure out what I wanted

01:35.719 --> 01:38.799
long term, and I did.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.159
Two things.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.400
I'm going to do everything I can
to get into the company,

01:44.439 --> 01:46.280
and I want to be with you.

01:46.319 --> 01:49.040
-Um, Christian, Tara, you
guys need to see this.

01:49.079 --> 01:50.439
REPORTER (ON TV): The Australian
dance community is

01:50.480 --> 01:51.239
in a state of unrest tonight
after a shock announcement

01:51.280 --> 01:51.760
from one of its true--

01:51.799 --> 01:53.079
-Think it over.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.599
-After 16 years as artistic
director of the National

01:57.640 --> 02:03.560
Ballet and a lifetime in the
theater, I feel the day has

02:03.599 --> 02:07.400
come to exit the stage
gracefully.

02:07.439 --> 02:08.479
-Whoa.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.840
-Game changer.

02:09.878 --> 02:11.800
SIR JEFFREY (ON TV): I do leave
assured my legacy will

02:11.840 --> 02:15.800
be in safe hands under the new
artistic director, my gifted

02:15.840 --> 02:19.520
protege, Rebecca Braithwaite.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.680
REPORTER (ON TV): At this early
stage, the new artistic

02:21.719 --> 02:25.039
director refused to be drawn on
her personal vision for the

02:25.080 --> 02:25.879
company.

02:25.919 --> 02:27.400
-Things just got interesting.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.120
REPORTER (ON TV): Some critics
may claim she's too young, too

02:29.159 --> 02:30.800
inexperienced for this
appointment.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.479
However, it does suggest there
is a strong push to move away

02:34.520 --> 02:35.479
from tradition.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.479
And one thing is certain--

02:37.520 --> 02:41.319
the ballet community faces
a tumultuous new era.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.319
-I got it!

02:42.360 --> 02:44.319
I just won Hilde!

02:44.360 --> 02:47.319
-Ollie, Macbeth.

02:47.360 --> 02:52.039
Ben and Christian, you'll both
be dancing Prince Charming.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.159
Tara, you'll be doing
Firebird.

02:56.199 --> 02:58.360
I'm making you an appointment
to see Dr. Wicks.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.680
And Abigail--

03:00.719 --> 03:01.960
-Sorry.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.439
Um, how can you possibly assign
our final audition

03:03.479 --> 03:05.599
solos when we don't even know
what Rebecca's looking for?

03:14.560 --> 03:17.240
-You can't keep applying heat
cream and hope it magically

03:17.280 --> 03:18.599
fixes itself.

03:18.639 --> 03:20.479
I'm putting her on
low impact--

03:20.520 --> 03:23.080
no arabesques, no allegro.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.719
-But auditions are less
than three weeks away.

03:24.759 --> 03:26.039
And it's just muscular.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.439
I'm not doing any damage.

03:27.479 --> 03:29.800
-Don't you love it when they
get their medical degrees?

03:29.840 --> 03:32.800
-If you've gained a skerrick
of sense since last year,

03:32.840 --> 03:34.639
you'll listen to Dr. Wicks.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.800
[fire alarm]

03:36.840 --> 03:39.159
-Ugh, again.

03:39.199 --> 03:41.479
-One, two, three.

03:45.479 --> 03:47.800
-Go ask if Sir Jeffrey's
list went with him.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.680
-I would've thought you would've
been desperate to do

03:49.719 --> 03:51.039
some networking.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.319
No one's ever gotten
into the company

03:54.360 --> 03:56.479
dancing a Macbeth solo.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.360
It's a fact.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.199
It's cursed.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.479
-Well, it's a good thing I've
got another option then.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.479
-Congratulations on Firebird.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.479
It's one of your favorites,
right?

04:07.520 --> 04:09.520
-You realize I have no reason
to trust this born-again

04:09.560 --> 04:11.039
Christian thing.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.520
-Good line.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.680
-Well, you can't just say what
you said like it cancels out

04:13.719 --> 04:15.520
everything and then go,
hey, think it over.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.680
How do I have the spare
head space for that?

04:17.720 --> 04:19.040
-You're right.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.639
You should focus on auditions
while I prove to you I'm

04:21.680 --> 04:22.639
stepping up.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.639
-Thrilled to hear
it, Mr. Reed.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.680
Come and find me later.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.360
-Nice evacuation, third years.

04:28.399 --> 04:30.720
The fire warden salutes you.

04:30.759 --> 04:33.199
-Um, compared to Sir Jeffrey,
for example, how would you

04:33.240 --> 04:34.639
describe your aesthetic?

04:34.680 --> 04:37.040
More contemporary, surely.

04:37.079 --> 04:38.800
-My aesthetic is simple.

04:38.839 --> 04:40.800
I want the best dancers on
the planet, wherever

04:40.839 --> 04:42.720
they might come from.

04:42.759 --> 04:44.120
Excuse me.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.319
-Lulu, in certain situations,
speed is more

04:52.360 --> 04:55.759
important than form.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.759
[MUSIC - JESSICA MAUBOY,
"OVER AND OVER"]

04:57.800 --> 04:59.319
-Six, seven, eight!

04:59.360 --> 05:02.759
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.720
And one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, And

05:06.759 --> 05:10.319
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.680
And one, two, three, four--

05:23.639 --> 05:26.279
-Potential backup dancers,
I salute you.

05:26.319 --> 05:29.120
And thanks for not
embarrassing me.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.120
Look, um, we'll be in contact
tonight about callbacks.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.759
So whatever you do, just
don't drop your

05:32.800 --> 05:34.160
phone in your coffee.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.800
-Hey.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.800
Uh, I just want to
say, huge fan.

05:43.839 --> 05:44.800
-Oh, cheers.

05:44.839 --> 05:46.160
Nicki's the best though.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.240
It's kind of hard not to look
good doing her chorey.

05:48.279 --> 05:49.519
-I know.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.199
I'm slightly terrified she
agreed to do my tour.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.319
But I actually meant
your music.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.800
You're all over my
Pilates playlist.

05:55.839 --> 05:58.240
-I may have sent Jess the link
to your web channel for

05:58.279 --> 06:00.120
inspiration.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.319
-That's crazy.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.199
I mean, you're Jessica Mauboy.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.480
Obviously, which you
already know.

06:06.519 --> 06:08.360
Wait, does this mean
I get a callback?

06:08.399 --> 06:09.839
-For backup dancing?

06:09.879 --> 06:11.199
I think we could aim higher.

06:15.879 --> 06:17.600
-The end of the school year
also means the end of your

06:17.639 --> 06:18.759
scholarship.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.639
Have you thought about
how you're going to

06:19.680 --> 06:21.439
cover living expenses?

06:21.480 --> 06:22.800
-Absolutely.

06:22.839 --> 06:24.240
I plan on getting a
contract with the

06:24.279 --> 06:25.680
National Ballet Company.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.399
You might have heard of it?

06:28.439 --> 06:29.839
-I hope you do, Christian.

06:29.879 --> 06:32.439
But if that doesn't eventuate,
the audition circuit's

06:32.480 --> 06:36.319
expensive, particularly if you
need to head overseas.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.480
-Right, of course.

06:38.519 --> 06:43.120
-I found some grants you
might be eligible for.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.160
-I don't need them.

06:45.199 --> 06:47.560
I can get a job.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.319
I should've been working
this year, saving up.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.319
-No one's suggesting we throw
you out on the streets.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.120
-I appreciate that, but you
guys have done enough.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.600
-Two, glissade, cabriole.

07:00.639 --> 07:03.480
Gather the force, explode!

07:06.199 --> 07:07.199
And--

07:07.240 --> 07:09.680
you're behind the
music, come on.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.160
Christian, keep up.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.319
-Benjamin.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.800
I have a plan.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.360
Come with me.

07:22.399 --> 07:24.639
-So how many of my unique
private coaching sessions

07:24.680 --> 07:26.040
shall we pencil in?

07:26.079 --> 07:28.800
-I think I'm going to work
through this one on my own.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.600
-Look, you and Ben both doing
Prince Charming, that was--

07:31.639 --> 07:32.560
that was my call, all right?

07:32.600 --> 07:34.120
It suits you in different
ways.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.480
I can help you find
a unique take.

07:36.519 --> 07:38.000
-I'm good with the solo.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.639
And like you said, you're not
going to be around forever to

07:39.680 --> 07:40.600
hold my hand.

07:40.639 --> 07:41.839
I've got this one.

07:50.839 --> 07:53.120
-Look, it's Saskia.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.519
-Why?

07:55.560 --> 07:58.600
Oh, is this the night
she broke her ankle?

07:58.639 --> 08:00.199
-How am I supposed to
match that if I'm

08:00.240 --> 08:01.720
not allowed to rehearse?

08:01.759 --> 08:03.240
-Lead role in the interview
production?

08:03.279 --> 08:04.240
G Good work, sister.

08:04.279 --> 08:07.399
-It's the casting coup
of the ages.

08:07.439 --> 08:08.759
-OK, children, please.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.439
Can we-- can we just get to the
ulterior motive already?

08:10.480 --> 08:12.759
-OK, school leavers around the
country are indulging in

08:12.800 --> 08:14.800
muck-up day graduation pranks.

08:14.839 --> 08:17.240
-But third years are banned
from such tomfoolery.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.800
-On pain of being excluded
from auditions.

08:19.839 --> 08:22.800
However, being a second year--

08:22.839 --> 08:24.800
-I'm exempt from such
punishment.

08:24.839 --> 08:27.639
-You are the perfect
pranker by proxy.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.120
-So this is what is occupying
your attention, not the new

08:31.160 --> 08:32.558
artistic director?

08:32.600 --> 08:33.919
-It's a rite of passage.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.159
No matter the stakes, the fun
shouldn't have to die.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.039
-Benjamin, I'm sorry, but I--

08:40.080 --> 08:43.080
I can't risk Raine wrath.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.279
-So that's a yes.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.759
-Oliver, it's a very firm no.

08:49.799 --> 08:51.519
Wes and I are researching.

08:51.559 --> 08:54.240
Did you know Rebecca has
a Ph.D. in kinesiology?

08:54.279 --> 08:57.159
She's literally a
dance doctor.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.039
-Wes, can you please tell her
that she can spend an hour to

09:00.080 --> 09:01.200
backup sing in one audition?

09:01.240 --> 09:02.480
One song.

09:02.519 --> 09:04.000
-It's a pointless diversion.

09:04.039 --> 09:06.320
You're not going to throw away
your company chance to be the

09:06.360 --> 09:09.600
opening act to some pop star.

09:09.639 --> 09:11.159
WES (ON LAPTOP): Beg
for it, Ollie.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.360
Hands and knees.

09:15.879 --> 09:21.200
-You're a very talented
performer, and you make me

09:21.240 --> 09:22.600
better than I am.

09:26.519 --> 09:30.559
-Will you help me crack
the Rebecca enigma?

09:30.600 --> 09:32.159
-Oh, yes.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.360
Thank you.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.559
-What do you want?

09:50.600 --> 09:51.440
-You're busy.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.639
-No, I'm unemployed.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.159
I've got all the time
in the world.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.639
-I heard a rumor, but
I didn't think--

09:59.679 --> 10:01.639
-So the official line is
that I'm not a good

10:01.679 --> 10:03.320
fit for the new company.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.320
But really, Rebecca's couldn't
wait to purge

10:05.360 --> 10:07.440
Sir Jeffrey's favorites.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.840
-I'm so sorry.

10:08.879 --> 10:11.279
-The board still knows I'm a
draw card, so I'm going to

10:11.320 --> 10:12.480
fight this.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.120
So what do you need?

10:18.159 --> 10:22.240
-I've been given Firebird as my
company audition piece, and

10:22.279 --> 10:26.080
you dance it better than anyone
and know how to work

10:26.120 --> 10:27.600
around an injury.

10:27.639 --> 10:28.879
I--

10:28.919 --> 10:33.440
I guess I was wondering if
maybe you'd help me--

10:33.480 --> 10:34.639
-Cheat?

10:39.399 --> 10:42.159
-I was thinking of maybe
changing the cabriole derriere

10:42.200 --> 10:43.759
to something more
back friendly,

10:43.799 --> 10:45.200
like a saut de basque.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.399
-Mm hmm.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.720
Right.

10:47.759 --> 10:49.240
And if you do things like extend
the phrasing of the

10:49.279 --> 10:50.840
releves, no one's going
to care the

10:50.879 --> 10:52.240
arabesque is a little lower.

10:54.559 --> 10:55.799
Have you considered doing
a solo that's

10:55.840 --> 10:58.200
a little less intense?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.799
-I've be dancing like 60 hours
a week for three years.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.759
I want to be intense
and dramatic.

11:09.879 --> 11:12.039
-What about the long
term though?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.360
You push yourself through the
pain barrier day after day,

11:14.399 --> 11:16.120
year after year.

11:16.159 --> 11:18.159
Trust me, I don't
recommend it.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.639
-If you don't want
to help, then--

11:19.679 --> 11:23.639
-Listen a girl in my year did
Persephone for her audition.

11:23.679 --> 11:25.120
-Look, I already know
Persephone.

11:25.159 --> 11:26.279
I did it before I even
came to the academy.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.639
It's just-- it's too easy.

11:27.679 --> 11:28.919
-Technically, yes.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.159
But artistically, you could
make it whenever you

11:31.200 --> 11:32.720
wanted it to be.

11:32.759 --> 11:36.480
And if you persist with
Firebird, I can't help you.

11:36.519 --> 11:37.639
I won't help you.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.720
-It's so obviously a publicity
stunt to cash in on his

11:55.759 --> 11:57.519
straight-to-Netflix movie.

11:57.559 --> 12:00.480
-Miss Raine, as Lulu is meant to
be playing my best friend,

12:00.519 --> 12:02.039
could you please tell her
to get in character?

12:02.080 --> 12:02.799
-Katrina, those piques.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.200
You're tottering.

12:07.639 --> 12:10.679
-Oh, good pain, good pain.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.480
[clears throat]

12:13.519 --> 12:16.200
-So, muck-up day.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.320
Remember last year's war
against my esteemed

12:18.360 --> 12:19.799
classmates?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.159
-Of course.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.480
-Presumably you had battle plans
that were never enacted.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.519
Dust 'em off.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.399
-OK, Rebecca said that they're
looking for the best dancers

12:32.440 --> 12:33.600
on the planet.

12:33.639 --> 12:34.559
Subtext--

12:34.600 --> 12:35.960
she has no loyalty
to the academy.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.799
Which actually makes sense,
because she never got in.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.320
-OK, we'll get to
Rebecca later.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.440
Can you just shut up
and look pretty?

12:41.480 --> 12:43.480
-Rude.

[feedback]

13:36.279 --> 13:38.200
[singing "stop me now"]

15:01.279 --> 15:04.399
-Look, everyone, I'm supporting
Jessica Mauboy!

15:04.440 --> 15:05.759
It's been such a tough year.

15:05.799 --> 15:09.240
This is like the first
real win I've had.

15:09.279 --> 15:11.639
-Uh, Abigail, we really
didn't meet yet.

15:11.679 --> 15:12.120
So amazing.

15:12.159 --> 15:13.320
-Thank you.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.480
-We'll find a great
replacement.

15:14.519 --> 15:16.600
-Uh, sorry?

15:16.639 --> 15:19.279
-Maybe half a dozen
for that stage.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.720
-But you're a duo.

15:21.759 --> 15:23.000
-No, no, no.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.480
I'm a solo artist, and Abigail's
already tied up to

15:24.519 --> 15:26.320
another audition process, so--

15:26.360 --> 15:29.639
-Uh, 'cause we want this.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.799
Just this.

15:36.159 --> 15:38.639
-How's it feeling?

15:38.679 --> 15:39.840
-Fine.

15:39.879 --> 15:43.039
It's just the solo is so
straightforward, there's

15:43.080 --> 15:46.200
nothing to push through
to get to--

15:46.240 --> 15:48.519
-Where?

15:48.559 --> 15:52.159
-I call it my magic place.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.519
You must know--

15:53.559 --> 15:57.840
where everything suddenly works,
and it's like the light

15:57.879 --> 16:01.679
fade and it's just
me and the music.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.399
-Tara, speaking from experience,
those moments can

16:06.440 --> 16:08.200
be unreliable.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.840
-They're also why
I love dancing.

16:10.879 --> 16:12.320
-That's fantastic.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.720
Love it all you like.

16:13.759 --> 16:15.480
But being a professional is
about what you do on your

16:15.519 --> 16:17.159
worst night--

16:17.200 --> 16:19.320
when it's your 100th
performance, the orchestra's

16:19.360 --> 16:22.480
playing too fast, your
costume falls off.

16:22.519 --> 16:25.600
You can't just stop and turn
to the audience and say,

16:25.639 --> 16:29.120
sorry, no magic.

16:29.159 --> 16:32.159
-So what, you just fake it?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.519
-No.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.159
You trust that you've done your
homework, that you've

16:35.200 --> 16:36.799
crafted your performance
and infused

16:36.840 --> 16:40.200
meaning into every step.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.159
That's how the grownups do it.

CHRISTIAN (ON TELEPHONE):
Does this mean you

16:50.200 --> 16:51.639
found the head space?

16:51.679 --> 16:53.200
-Where are you?

17:04.160 --> 17:05.358
You're a lifeguard.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.480
-I'm in training
to be one, yes.

17:07.519 --> 17:09.358
And just because you
didn't organize it

17:09.400 --> 17:10.640
doesn't make it wrong.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.279
-What happened to your
compelling speech about

17:12.319 --> 17:13.720
focusing on the company?

17:13.759 --> 17:14.839
Did you actually want to get in,
were you just saying that

17:14.880 --> 17:15.720
for effect?

17:15.759 --> 17:17.440
-Yes, I--

17:17.480 --> 17:19.640
I'm 90% sure I want to.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.118
-Christian.

17:21.160 --> 17:25.559
-If I don't get in, I'm gonna
need some cash as a buffer.

17:25.598 --> 17:28.720
Look, my shift's almost over.

17:28.759 --> 17:30.680
Why don't you help me with
some rescue skills?

17:38.160 --> 17:43.039
Maybe we need conversation
embargoes, change of subjects

17:43.079 --> 17:44.160
be we put into the
no-fly zone.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.440
-Like your career and
my expectations?

17:47.480 --> 17:49.599
-You don't try and fix me.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.559
-You don't retreat.

17:50.599 --> 17:52.799
You tell me what you're
thinking.

17:52.839 --> 17:53.799
-Like right now?

17:53.839 --> 17:55.519
You wanna know what
I'm thinking?

18:06.480 --> 18:08.839
Kind of a magic moment.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.200
-I hear those are unreliable.

18:20.559 --> 18:23.759
-I've only contracted
economy-class travel.

18:23.799 --> 18:25.480
Think we need an agent?

18:25.519 --> 18:27.079
-Can you stop pretending
to read that, please?

18:34.640 --> 18:35.599
So I'm here now.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.319
How do you want to
dig for dirt?

18:41.319 --> 18:42.720
-OK.

18:42.759 --> 18:45.319
Strictly for argument's sake,
this tour is a bird in the

18:45.359 --> 18:46.440
hand.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.160
-It's performing in front
of thousands of

18:47.200 --> 18:48.640
people every night.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.599
It's a career.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.160
-And the company's
a total unknown.

18:51.200 --> 18:51.759
-Wait, wait, wait.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.200
So you're saying--

18:53.240 --> 18:54.440
-How stupid would we feel if
we turn this offer down and

18:54.480 --> 18:55.640
Rebecca takes none of us?

19:11.839 --> 19:13.359
-What?

19:13.400 --> 19:15.640
-Doesn't matter.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.319
I was going to tell you
about my solo, but I--

19:17.359 --> 19:18.680
I think we should put that
on the banned list.

19:18.720 --> 19:22.279
Just, I get anxious, and-- and
it-- it never ends well.

19:22.319 --> 19:24.559
-OK, this is stupid.

19:24.599 --> 19:26.799
-I suddenly don't know
what to say to you.

19:26.839 --> 19:29.680
-There are minefields.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.400
-Can we really do this?

19:31.440 --> 19:33.519
Rules so we don't
end up fighting?

19:33.559 --> 19:34.759
-Hey, come here.

19:38.640 --> 19:42.279
-Have you ever thought that if
it was going to work then--

19:42.319 --> 19:45.599
-It would've happened by now?

19:45.640 --> 19:48.680
-I mean, it's not like
we haven't tried.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.480
Lots of times.

19:49.519 --> 19:50.440
I--

19:50.480 --> 19:52.200
I cling onto those
magic moments.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.359
And--

19:53.400 --> 19:55.640
and then the rest of the
time, we just fight.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.279
-Hurt each other.

19:58.319 --> 19:59.480
I know.

20:01.839 --> 20:03.799
So do you think it's--

20:03.839 --> 20:06.599
-Over?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.440
Do you?

20:08.480 --> 20:10.799
-Can't we just rewind
five minutes?

20:16.240 --> 20:18.480
Well, what if--

20:18.519 --> 20:21.359
-What?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.200
-I don't think I'm ever
going to love anyone

20:23.240 --> 20:25.279
the way I love you.

20:36.599 --> 20:41.720
TARA NARRATING: I can't help
feeling manipulated by all

20:41.759 --> 20:43.799
those love stories in
all those movies

20:43.839 --> 20:46.519
and books and ballets.

20:46.559 --> 20:50.119
They teach you that if you
suffer enough it works out in

20:50.160 --> 20:50.960
the end.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.480
-I think I'm going to retire.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.960
-What?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.759
But any company in the world
would take you in an instant.

20:56.799 --> 21:00.200
-I'm just sick off starting each
morning with coffee and a

21:00.240 --> 21:01.359
painkiller.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.079
I don't want to push myself
so hard anymore.

21:06.079 --> 21:07.599
Anyway, Persephone.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.359
You need to tell the story
with every step.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.359
TARA NARRATING: I guess the key
phrase is "love story." I

21:13.400 --> 21:15.759
can't live in a magic, made-up
world any longer.

21:19.880 --> 21:23.200
It's time to force myself
to be present.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.720
Treat love like the
best dancing.

21:25.759 --> 21:30.599
Aim for effortless, pain free,
beautiful in its simplicity.

21:40.680 --> 21:41.759
-I don't know.

21:41.799 --> 21:43.599
If it was Sir Jeffrey
with his list, I'd

21:43.640 --> 21:44.839
say we take the tour.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.759
But with Rebecca, we still
don't know anything.

21:48.799 --> 21:50.200
-OK.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.400
Research aside, what are you
gut feelings about Rebecca?

21:59.079 --> 22:00.240
-I think--

22:04.519 --> 22:06.319
I think she loves ballet
more than anything.

22:12.559 --> 22:17.799
-Tails, you risk everything
on the company.

22:17.839 --> 22:19.480
Heads, tour with Mauboy.

22:28.839 --> 22:29.839
-Best of three?

22:29.880 --> 22:31.400
-Nice and orderly, please.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.400
Straight through the
emergency exit.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.319
[fire alarm]

22:42.519 --> 22:43.759
-Mate, we've gotta go.

22:46.880 --> 22:51.440
-I don't deserve it, but if I'm
gonna be Prince Charming,

22:51.480 --> 22:55.480
I'm gonna need your help.

22:55.519 --> 22:56.799
-Come on, let's go.

23:00.359 --> 23:02.400
-Persephone's far too prosaic.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.079
-I disagree.

23:03.119 --> 23:04.319
I'll make it special.

23:04.359 --> 23:06.079
-No, you'll take the
time as instructed.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.039
And then when your back
improves, you'll do the solo I

23:08.079 --> 23:09.039
selected for you.

23:09.079 --> 23:10.519
-Respectfully, I won't,
Miss Raine.

23:10.559 --> 23:11.720
I'm going to keep working
with Saskia.

23:11.759 --> 23:13.359
I'm learning a lot from her.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.799
-Happy muck-up day, everyone.

23:32.839 --> 23:34.359
-Katrina Karamakov, here!

23:34.400 --> 23:35.559
Now!

23:43.319 --> 23:45.599
-This is our last
wharf battle.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.160
We graduate in three weeks.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.559
-Game on, Tara Webster.

23:51.599 --> 23:52.759
Game on.
