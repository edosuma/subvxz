how using this boy

After all, you are the expert,

There is one thing

16:32.617 --> 16:34.642

lt seems that
the telephone here

16:37.155 --> 16:40.659

in Santa Fe are expecting
a phone call from me.

16:40.758 --> 16:42.658
They will be very worried.

a search warrant,

release Roberto
to their custody.

of Saint Bernadette.

19:53.884 --> 19:58.548

would appear to me in
a brilliant shower of light.

19:58.656 --> 19:59.839
Did she?

19:59.957 --> 20:03.541
No, l got a sore throat
for staying out all night.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.401
The only shower of light
l've ever seen

20:05.496 --> 20:07.839

the way they really are

20:22.313 --> 20:24.861

20:44.001 --> 20:46.026
Sure you don't want some?

20:52.143 --> 20:56.375
Why can't we just stick
to business and forget
about one lousy illegal?

20:56.480 --> 21:00.826
Because if we do,
maybe there won't be
a business to stick to.

You object to my strategy?

Waging war against
a bunch of nuns.

21:11.629 --> 21:15.178
One of the first things
you have to learn about war,
my son,

21:15.266 --> 21:17.257
is that you never
underestimate
your enemy.

21:17.368 --> 21:20.713
Before Mom died,
we used to go to
church every Sunday.

21:21.806 --> 21:23.148

the enemy then.

both of them separate.

got us out of Mexico.

your Uncle Sal.

but l remember.

Except for my father.

22:27.872 --> 22:29.260
Poor Papa.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.947
He was so afraid to do
anything that the church
might disapprove of.

22:34.044 --> 22:35.705
He made us humble,

22:36.847 --> 22:39.953
and filled us with the fear
of eternity in hell.

in the fields
and we picked beets,

22:45.289 --> 22:48.395

stand up straight anymore.

being there for his
precious last rights.
