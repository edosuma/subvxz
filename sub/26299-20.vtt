WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:04.327
Mnh! How can my babies be early?!

00:04.429 --> 00:06.496
I've never been early to anything!

00:06.598 --> 00:07.964
Maybe they're not mine!

00:08.032 --> 00:09.699
I've always been faithful to you!

00:11.381 --> 00:12.802
Push, damn it!

00:12.871 --> 00:14.270
I'm not losing another baby today.

00:15.788 --> 00:17.607
Cardiac arrest. Crash cart!

00:17.676 --> 00:18.775
The shock could kill the baby!

00:20.112 --> 00:21.544
That's something I'll
just have to live with.

00:21.580 --> 00:24.581
- Maybe we could turn off the TV?
- Clear!

00:24.583 --> 00:27.283
Well, folks,
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

00:27.386 --> 00:29.786
- Oh, my God, no.
- N-No, not that bad.

00:29.888 --> 00:31.287
I'm sorry. I did not think that through.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.223
No, you're not giving birth today.

00:33.291 --> 00:36.292
You've had false contractions, known
as Braxton Hicks. It's very common.

00:36.395 --> 00:38.128
Uh, so what does that mean timing-wise?

00:38.230 --> 00:40.530
It's no indication.
It could be five weeks from now,

00:40.632 --> 00:42.432
could be five hours from now.

00:42.534 --> 00:44.067
I suggest you and your husband go home,

00:44.169 --> 00:45.602
get some sleep while you still can.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.904
Oh, we're not married.
We're just lovers.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.139
Ugh! Yuck.

00:49.241 --> 00:50.507
She hates that word.

00:50.609 --> 00:51.808
Grosses me out, too,

00:51.910 --> 00:53.910
and I spend a lot of my
time covered in afterbirth.

00:57.649 --> 00:59.315
Everything okay?

00:59.418 --> 01:01.284
Um... that was weird.

01:01.386 --> 01:04.019
Those little people
with the full-size baby?

01:04.117 --> 01:06.523
No, when the doctor
called you my husband.

01:07.194 --> 01:08.692
Well, people are gonna assume...

01:08.794 --> 01:11.661
No, it... it was weird because I...

01:11.763 --> 01:12.929
liked it.

01:12.998 --> 01:15.265
Seriously?
Because I proposed, like, six times.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.399
I know. I just...

01:16.468 --> 01:18.234
It seemed so old-fashioned at the time,

01:18.336 --> 01:21.071
but when I thought that
the babies were coming,

01:21.173 --> 01:22.906
I-I...

01:22.974 --> 01:24.541
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

01:28.747 --> 01:30.146
I'm gonna need a little help here.

01:30.248 --> 01:31.281
Okay.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.078
Okay, we're good.

01:34.319 --> 01:37.153
Dylan Stardust Marshall, will you...

01:37.255 --> 01:39.289
Oh! Going over. Okay. Okay.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.757
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's okay.

01:41.960 --> 01:42.992
Will you marry me?

01:43.523 --> 01:46.629
Oh, my God.
This is exactly how I imagined it.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:59.995 --> 02:01.070
I can't get in!

02:01.080 --> 02:02.622
Damn it, Cam! We need those tickets!

02:02.648 --> 02:04.013
- Come on, refresh.
- I am!

02:04.116 --> 02:05.949
- Refresh like your life depends on it!
- I am!

02:06.051 --> 02:07.717
Tonight is the L.A. premiere

02:07.786 --> 02:10.220
of "Sophie's Choice: The Musical."

02:10.322 --> 02:11.821
And it sold out in seconds,

02:11.923 --> 02:14.424
but the theater reserved
a few amazing house seats

02:14.526 --> 02:15.592
for an online lottery.

02:15.694 --> 02:16.793
And there's a rumor

02:16.895 --> 02:18.995
Meryl Streep is going
to be in the audience.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.631
- Oh, my God.
- You have to feel for that poor actress playing Sophie.

02:21.733 --> 02:24.334
It'd be like me sewing costumes
in front of Bob Mackie.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.904
And the award for the gayest
thing ever said goes to...

02:27.906 --> 02:29.005
- I'm in!
- You are?!

02:29.007 --> 02:31.007
- We have seats!
- Oh, my God! Oh, oh!

02:31.109 --> 02:32.242
- Focus, focus.
- Okay, all right.

02:32.344 --> 02:33.877
Okay, it's one of those
ticking clock things.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.279
That's fine.
We just need my... credit card.

02:36.381 --> 02:37.547
Where's my wallet?
Where... Where's my wall...

02:37.649 --> 02:39.249
- Where's my wallet?!
- Seriously? Again?

02:39.351 --> 02:40.850
Cam, you have to leave it in one place!

02:40.952 --> 02:41.985
I told you a thousand times!

02:42.087 --> 02:43.186
Really? Now?

02:43.188 --> 02:44.454
Okay, just use your credit card.

02:45.557 --> 02:46.656
That's weird.

02:46.658 --> 02:48.625
Okay. I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick!

02:48.727 --> 02:50.927
- Here... use mine.
- Oh! Thank you, sweetie.

02:51.029 --> 02:52.362
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

02:54.671 --> 02:56.533
- Is this a sign?
- Yes! We are meant to see the show!

02:56.635 --> 02:58.001
No, it's one of those CAPTCHA things.

02:58.103 --> 02:59.202
Is that a road sign?!

02:59.204 --> 03:00.336
- Yes!
- I don't know.

03:00.438 --> 03:01.504
Yes.

03:01.923 --> 03:04.040
Oh! Ohh! Aah! Oh, my God!

03:04.142 --> 03:06.342
Oh, thank you, sweetie. You saved us.

03:06.411 --> 03:08.711
- It's fine. I needed the miles.
- Thank you.

03:09.737 --> 03:10.480
Where's she off to?

03:10.482 --> 03:11.915
- I'm sure it's fine.
- Okay.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.618
How about this one?

03:15.720 --> 03:16.986
You look gorgeous.

03:17.088 --> 03:18.221
Now, remember...

03:18.290 --> 03:19.489
Okay, this is not my first time

03:19.591 --> 03:21.224
impressing your business associates.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.425
I know the drill.

03:22.427 --> 03:24.727
Laugh at their jokes,
touch their arms...

03:24.830 --> 03:25.862
Yeah, and if he pees on the floor,

03:25.964 --> 03:27.063
don't make a big deal out of it.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.498
What is happening?

03:28.600 --> 03:29.933
I quit the closet game

03:30.035 --> 03:33.536
to become the king of high-end,
whimsical dog beds.

03:33.605 --> 03:35.805
And to market them today, I'm hosting

03:35.907 --> 03:38.641
social-media influencer Arthur Goodboy.

03:38.743 --> 03:39.843
This little stud

03:39.945 --> 03:43.012
has over 5 million
followers on the Instagram.

03:43.114 --> 03:46.216
One photo of him with a
product can be a game-changer.

03:46.318 --> 03:49.319
You made me change
three times for a dog?

03:49.387 --> 03:50.854
He cannot even see this color!

03:50.956 --> 03:52.088
They can sense the effort!

03:55.994 --> 03:58.261
Welcome! Welcome. I'm Jay Pritchett.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.430
- Hello.
- This is my wife, Gloria.

04:01.196 --> 04:02.999
Hello. Orson Funt.

04:03.101 --> 04:04.934
I'm sure everyone knows Arthur Goodboy.

04:05.003 --> 04:08.037
Who doesn't? And I must admit,
I'm a little starstruck.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.305
Don't be.

04:09.307 --> 04:10.840
He puts on his sweaters
one leg at a time.

04:12.944 --> 04:15.044
And this is Stella of
Dog Beds by Stella,

04:15.146 --> 04:16.980
but I do most of the design.

04:18.183 --> 04:21.017
Well. She is beautiful
for a non-pro. May I?

04:21.119 --> 04:22.385
- Here you go.
- Yes.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.486
- May I?
- Oh, yeah.

04:23.488 --> 04:24.988
Thank you. Oh, yes.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.856
Present! Present.

04:26.925 --> 04:29.492
Who's a lovely lady?
Who's a lovely lady?

04:29.561 --> 04:31.527
Who's an elegant boy?
Who's an influencer?

04:31.630 --> 04:33.162
Ooh, you are! You are!

04:33.231 --> 04:35.098
Who's an influencer? You are!

04:36.519 --> 04:37.710
You want to see the dog beds?

04:37.910 --> 04:39.035
- Yes.
- Follow me.

04:40.138 --> 04:41.337
He's a good father.

04:41.439 --> 04:42.772
He's a good father.

04:48.745 --> 04:50.313
Sir...

04:50.382 --> 04:52.034
a dog in a pineapple?

04:52.826 --> 04:55.694
- Love!
- I call that one "Puppy Colada."

04:55.894 --> 04:57.053
- Stop!
- Yes, stop.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.123
So, what do you say? Are we in business?

05:00.225 --> 05:02.392
Oh! Oh, down boy.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.027
I like to make sure that Arthur Goodboy

05:04.095 --> 05:06.529
really loves the product
before we do any endorsements.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.764
If we said yes to everything,

05:07.832 --> 05:09.432
then we're no better than
that whore Grumpy Cat.

05:09.501 --> 05:11.067
Here, try this one.

05:11.169 --> 05:13.136
Okay, Mr. Arthur Goodboy.

05:13.204 --> 05:15.204
Why don't you just trot
yourself right in there

05:15.307 --> 05:16.372
and take a load off?

05:17.797 --> 05:21.077
Hm. You know,
he just woke up from a nap, so...

05:21.146 --> 05:23.713
he will probably tucker
out in a couple of hours.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.848
It's cool, 'cause
I have nowhere I need to be.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.116
You don't say.

05:27.185 --> 05:28.217
Oh, it's spacious.

05:31.135 --> 05:32.555
- Haley?
- Over here!

05:33.692 --> 05:35.658
- Mom's not with you, right?
- No.

05:35.727 --> 05:36.626
What's going on?

05:36.695 --> 05:38.962
What could you have possibly done
that's worse than getting pregnant?

05:39.030 --> 05:40.763
Well, Dylan and I are eloping,

05:40.832 --> 05:42.532
and we want you to be the witness.

05:43.345 --> 05:44.634
Oh, my God! Yes!

05:44.736 --> 05:47.370
Oh, I can't even tell you how
special this makes me feel.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.038
I will not tell anyone. I...

05:49.107 --> 05:51.007
Wait. Why eloping? Why not a wedding?

05:51.183 --> 05:53.843
- We just want it to be simple and quick.
- And no drama.

05:53.912 --> 05:55.511
- Guess that eliminates Mom.
- Yeah.

05:55.580 --> 05:56.913
What eliminates Mom?

05:56.982 --> 05:58.414
Oh, um...

05:58.516 --> 06:00.750
You know, uh... You know, it...
it's so funny when...

06:00.852 --> 06:02.919
when people do such, um, funny...

06:02.988 --> 06:05.021
You know, the story is so short,

06:05.090 --> 06:06.322
- but it... it... it would be so long...
- Enough, enough.

06:06.391 --> 06:07.623
I cannot watch this.

06:07.692 --> 06:09.759
Aw. I felt like she was
building to something.

06:09.794 --> 06:13.830
Dylan and I are going to the
courthouse to get married.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.667
- Wow.
- It's nothing personal, you know?

06:17.769 --> 06:19.969
It's just... right now,
the last thing we want

06:20.071 --> 06:22.005
is it to turn into a big production.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.874
Well, honey, if that's what you want,

06:24.976 --> 06:27.844
as your mother, obviously,
it's incredibly painful,

06:27.946 --> 06:30.079
but that... that's none of your concern.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.749
I just hope you have a
wedding that's every bit

06:32.851 --> 06:35.885
as wonderful and beautiful
as I always imagined.

06:35.987 --> 06:38.688
You know...
when I was gonna be part of it.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.257
I knew she'd be cool.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.391
- Yeah!
- Let's roll.

06:43.050 --> 06:44.160
Mom seemed pretty bummed about it,

06:44.262 --> 06:45.528
but, you know, this is what we want.

06:45.597 --> 06:46.629
Totally!

06:47.599 --> 06:48.765
Damn it!

06:50.568 --> 06:53.669
How could you do this to your mother?

06:55.235 --> 06:57.055
Ugh. What's taking them so long?

06:57.058 --> 06:59.658
I know. It's, like,
this wedding isn't about them.

06:59.726 --> 07:01.192
It's about you and Dylan and me!

07:01.294 --> 07:02.327
Coming!

07:02.329 --> 07:03.401
So sorry.

07:03.664 --> 07:04.829
And don't worry, Haley.

07:04.898 --> 07:08.700
I promise you will hardly
know we are there at all.

07:08.735 --> 07:10.001
What? You're dressed nicer than me.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.636
Well, I wasn't gonna say anything,
but are you sure

07:11.705 --> 07:13.238
that's the outfit you
want for your special day?

07:13.306 --> 07:15.740
It's Haley's wedding.
She can dress as bad as she wants.

07:15.842 --> 07:17.776
- Right.
- Who died?

07:17.878 --> 07:19.377
Haley and Dylan are getting married.

07:19.479 --> 07:20.612
Dressed like that?

07:20.647 --> 07:22.080
Now I have to invite Luke?

07:22.149 --> 07:23.381
Not if you don't want to.

07:23.483 --> 07:24.616
This feels great.

07:24.685 --> 07:27.252
Okay, that is it. Luke, but no one else.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.421
Hey, so, my mom found out
your parents are coming,

07:29.489 --> 07:31.322
'cause I told her,
and now she's on her way.

07:31.425 --> 07:32.757
And Grandpa's coming.

07:32.826 --> 07:34.092
You guys are gonna love him.

07:34.161 --> 07:36.076
Oh, but if he asks you
to kill him, don't.

07:36.111 --> 07:37.662
- Ugh!
- I know what you're thinking.

07:37.731 --> 07:38.963
That is a lot of people

07:39.066 --> 07:41.232
for a small, impersonal
room at the courthouse,

07:41.334 --> 07:43.968
and we are on the same page.

07:44.037 --> 07:46.004
So... why don't we just do it here?

07:46.073 --> 07:48.707
I'm ordained.
I can perform the ceremony.

07:48.775 --> 07:50.341
That is such a great idea!

07:50.444 --> 07:52.277
That way, it's easy and intimate.

07:52.345 --> 07:53.611
I mean, that's what you wanted, right?

07:53.680 --> 07:55.413
So, go down to the courthouse,

07:55.482 --> 07:57.615
get your marriage license,
come back here,

07:57.684 --> 07:59.384
and we'll all be waiting.

07:59.486 --> 08:01.119
Fine. But let's go now.

08:01.188 --> 08:02.721
I'm starving,
and they make a great soft pretzel

08:02.823 --> 08:03.922
at the courthouse snack shop.

08:03.924 --> 08:04.989
How do you know that?

08:05.092 --> 08:06.458
I can still elope.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.625
Don't you ruin this for me.

08:07.627 --> 08:09.527
It's fine. It's fine.

08:11.231 --> 08:12.281
Wait.

08:12.365 --> 08:13.765
If Dylan's bringing his grandfather,

08:13.834 --> 08:15.734
that means we have to invite
Dad and Gloria, right?

08:15.802 --> 08:17.035
I think so, yeah.

08:17.104 --> 08:18.803
But he probably won't show.
Jay hates last-minute plans.

08:18.839 --> 08:20.839
He'll be like, "Oh,
geez, why don't they just elope?"

08:20.941 --> 08:22.874
- Hm.
- Grandpa?

08:25.145 --> 08:27.212
Who's a goody-woody boy?

08:27.280 --> 08:29.047
Who's a sleepy boy?

08:29.149 --> 08:30.482
I never thought I'd say this,

08:30.584 --> 08:33.051
but I miss Jay's toxic masculinity.

08:33.153 --> 08:34.919
At least he's not your real father.

08:36.056 --> 08:38.222
- I'll get it! I got it!
- I'll get it!

08:39.292 --> 08:40.558
- Hello?
- Hey, Gloria.

08:40.626 --> 08:43.628
Haley and Dylan decided to
get married this afternoon,

08:43.697 --> 08:45.830
and I know Dad's got that dog-bed thing,

08:45.899 --> 08:47.999
so absolutely no pressure.

08:48.068 --> 08:50.235
Yes. We will be there as soon as we can.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.004
Jay, I am so sorry to break up

08:53.073 --> 08:55.573
this really fun and super normal party,

08:55.642 --> 08:58.877
but Dylan and Haley decided
to get married right now,

08:58.945 --> 09:00.745
and Claire wants us there.

09:00.847 --> 09:02.514
Oh, geez, why don't they just elope?

09:02.582 --> 09:05.884
Actually, Arthur Goodboy loves weddings,

09:05.952 --> 09:08.186
and his followers have been
dying to see him in his new tux.

09:08.255 --> 09:10.421
I-I can bring a bed
in case he gets tired.

09:10.524 --> 09:11.601
Ooh!

09:12.893 --> 09:15.093
Ooh, look. Somebody's got a crush.

09:15.162 --> 09:17.162
Would Miss Stella do us the honor

09:17.230 --> 09:19.230
of escorting Arthur
Goodboy to the wedding?!

09:19.332 --> 09:22.033
Gosh, yes! A thousand times yes!

09:25.572 --> 09:27.806
Well. You're not gonna believe this.
They're coming.

09:27.908 --> 09:29.040
Well, if they're coming, does that mean

09:29.142 --> 09:30.241
we need to invite Mitch and Cam?

09:30.310 --> 09:32.510
Ooh. Imagine the drama if we didn't.

09:32.612 --> 09:33.845
♪ Who should I choose? ♪

09:33.947 --> 09:35.513
♪ Either way, I lose ♪

09:35.615 --> 09:36.815
♪ I stare at the gun ♪

09:36.917 --> 09:38.683
♪ Is it daughter, is it son? ♪

09:38.785 --> 09:39.818
♪ Choices ♪

09:39.920 --> 09:41.052
- ♪ Impossible choices ♪
- ♪ Choices ♪

09:41.087 --> 09:42.453
- ♪ Impossible choices ♪
- ♪ Impossible ♪

09:42.556 --> 09:43.822
♪ Choices ♪

09:43.890 --> 09:45.909
This is why I can't have friends over.

09:46.109 --> 09:47.258
- Okay.
- Somebody just snarked her way

09:47.327 --> 09:49.394
- out of a "Sophie's Choice" hoodie!
- That's right.

09:51.078 --> 09:52.230
Hey, Claire. What's up?

09:52.299 --> 09:54.732
So, Haley and Dylan
decided to get married,

09:54.835 --> 09:56.401
and they'd be devastated
if you weren't there.

09:56.469 --> 09:58.336
Oh, of course!
We wouldn't miss it for the world!

09:58.405 --> 10:00.805
- Just tell us when.
- In about an hour.

10:00.907 --> 10:02.640
Oh, my... Um... Hey, uh, let...

10:02.709 --> 10:04.203
let me call you right back, okay?

10:04.511 --> 10:05.610
Are you kidding me?!

10:05.645 --> 10:07.345
I know! What do we do...
a musical or the wedding?

10:07.447 --> 10:10.181
It's the cruelest decision
anyone's ever been forced to make.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.752
Hello? We are here!

10:14.855 --> 10:16.020
Hi.

10:16.089 --> 10:17.222
Hi! Wow!

10:17.290 --> 10:18.623
What is all this?

10:18.725 --> 10:19.757
Hey, Claire.

10:19.860 --> 10:21.025
This is Orson

10:21.094 --> 10:23.261
and, of course, Arthur Goodboy.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.063
Thanks for having us. We love love.

10:25.065 --> 10:26.097
Mm-hmm.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.599
Dad, can you come over here a second?

10:27.701 --> 10:29.033
Um... Hey, Stella.

10:29.102 --> 10:30.969
So, listen, I don't think Haley

10:31.071 --> 10:33.605
wants to come back to a house
full of strangers and dogs.

10:33.707 --> 10:34.772
Claire, I've got to have this,

10:34.875 --> 10:36.341
and she's never gonna
know they're even here.

10:38.411 --> 10:39.777
Okay, that's bad timing.

10:39.846 --> 10:41.279
Okay, okay, let's...
let's go, let's go, let's go.

10:41.348 --> 10:42.447
- Let's go.
- Let's get it going.

10:42.449 --> 10:44.449
What's your hurry? I thought you...

10:44.517 --> 10:45.617
guys love weddings.

10:45.685 --> 10:47.418
You were gonna say "you people,"
weren't you?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.520
- Prove it.
- We have theater tickets,

10:49.623 --> 10:50.755
and if we get this wedding started,

10:50.857 --> 10:52.190
we can still make curtain
for "Sophie's Choice."

10:52.646 --> 10:54.092
I would murder my entire family

10:54.194 --> 10:55.660
and all of their friends
to see that musical.

10:55.762 --> 10:57.061
This guy gets it.

10:57.163 --> 10:59.430
Hey-oh! Look who's here!

10:59.532 --> 11:01.833
Don't worry. I'm wearing pants.

11:01.902 --> 11:03.434
As far as you know.

11:03.470 --> 11:05.103
Oh, well, hello, Frank.

11:05.205 --> 11:07.472
And thank you for... sort of making it.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.707
- Really?
- Well, you invited your dad.

11:09.776 --> 11:11.409
- What was I supposed to do?
- I don't know.

11:11.478 --> 11:13.244
Hey! Is that Arthur Goodboy?

11:13.346 --> 11:14.445
Big fan!

11:14.514 --> 11:16.214
Been waiting to see him in his tux.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.548
- Hi Fred.
- Farrah.

11:17.651 --> 11:19.517
- Phil.
- It is so delightful to see...

11:19.552 --> 11:20.785
Mm. Okay.

11:22.355 --> 11:23.955
Oh. Gosh.

11:24.024 --> 11:25.523
Can you believe our babies
are getting married?

11:25.625 --> 11:29.027
I can. I saw it in a vision
at a campfire in Peru.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.695
This is my father, Bert.

11:30.764 --> 11:32.030
Oh, it's such an honor to...

11:32.098 --> 11:33.765
- Vodka!
- Oh.

11:35.435 --> 11:36.534
What a lovely dress.

11:36.603 --> 11:38.303
It's actually a shamanic wedding robe

11:38.405 --> 11:39.470
from South America.

11:39.539 --> 11:41.839
I wear it at every ceremony I officiate.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.207
Ohhh. This is awkward.

11:43.310 --> 11:44.408
Um...

11:44.858 --> 11:46.077
I'm doing the ceremony.

11:46.179 --> 11:49.113
But this is something I've
dreamed about all of my lives.

11:49.215 --> 11:50.982
Mom, what the hell is going on?

11:51.084 --> 11:52.317
Hey!

11:54.354 --> 11:55.954
Oh, honey, honey,
it's not as bad as it looks.

11:56.056 --> 11:58.389
See, it's still small and simple and...

11:59.793 --> 12:00.892
Not helping.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.294
What? We were gonna
play her down the aisle.

12:03.363 --> 12:05.697
Yeah. Bad luck to get married
without bagpipes.

12:05.799 --> 12:08.066
My mom's first wedding... no bagpipes.

12:08.168 --> 12:10.868
My mom's second wedding... bagpipes.

12:10.937 --> 12:13.271
Six months later, she's still married.

12:13.373 --> 12:14.839
I mean, that's just science.

12:15.041 --> 12:16.140
Now what?

12:16.242 --> 12:17.809
Oh, well, we needed food, so...

12:17.911 --> 12:19.310
Hola, lovebirds.

12:19.412 --> 12:20.745
Oh, this is a disaster.

12:20.847 --> 12:23.982
I know, but we can't
pick our childhood homes.

12:24.084 --> 12:25.750
Don't worry. I can fix everything.

12:25.852 --> 12:27.585
Just take your time
changing your clothes.

12:27.587 --> 12:28.686
Oh, this is what I'm wearing.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.288
You're hilarious.

12:31.291 --> 12:34.292
Let me see the happy couple.

12:34.394 --> 12:36.160
Congratulations, Haley.

12:36.262 --> 12:38.363
Congratulations, Andy.

12:43.844 --> 12:45.736
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

12:45.805 --> 12:48.505
- Sorry.
- Honey, I know you're a little annoyed.

12:48.541 --> 12:50.074
Oh, I'm so sorry
I gave you that impression.

12:50.142 --> 12:51.375
I'm a lot annoyed.

12:51.477 --> 12:52.710
But it's better.

12:52.745 --> 12:55.846
This way, you'll be surrounded
by people who love you.

12:55.948 --> 12:56.980
That's her.

12:57.049 --> 13:01.085
- Congratulations! I am so happy for you.
- Luke?

13:01.187 --> 13:03.120
- Uh, this is Annabelle.
- We just met on Tinder.

13:03.189 --> 13:04.588
But we haven't done anything yet.

13:05.173 --> 13:07.558
Guess what, babies.
You're gonna taste some wine today!

13:07.626 --> 13:08.692
Hey, hey, hey.

13:08.761 --> 13:09.860
So, if we're gonna
get this thing started,

13:09.929 --> 13:11.128
maybe you should go up and change, huh?

13:11.197 --> 13:12.296
Oh, for the last time,
this is what I'm...

13:12.365 --> 13:13.564
Screw it. I'm changing.

13:13.632 --> 13:14.898
- No, don't... I'm...
- No, don't change, if that's...

13:15.000 --> 13:16.834
- Damn it! What...
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

13:16.936 --> 13:18.235
Gloria, Gloria.

13:18.304 --> 13:19.370
Do me a favor.

13:19.438 --> 13:21.271
Put some salami in my TV.

13:21.340 --> 13:23.374
Whatever that is a code for,
the answer is no.

13:23.442 --> 13:24.875
Okay, fine. I'll do it myself.

13:24.910 --> 13:27.311
Keep Orson occupied for about a minute.

13:27.346 --> 13:28.479
Arthur Goodboy, come.

13:28.647 --> 13:30.314
Arthur Goodboy, come.

13:30.416 --> 13:31.849
Mr. Orson.

13:31.917 --> 13:36.286
Um, I need to know...
is your whole life your dog?

13:36.355 --> 13:38.956
Oh, no.
I also dabble in stand-up comedy.

13:38.991 --> 13:41.458
In fact, I used to try out all
of my material on Arthur Goodboy

13:41.527 --> 13:43.527
until I got in trouble with
PETA for animal testing.

13:45.398 --> 13:47.498
- Ay!
- Speaking of, where is Arthur?

13:47.566 --> 13:49.833
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Arthur? Arthur?

13:49.902 --> 13:53.070
He's in the family room,
wolfing down some cold cuts.

13:53.172 --> 13:54.838
No, no, no. He can't digest that.

13:54.874 --> 13:56.206
And that tuxedo is rented.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.542
No, please! Wait!

14:00.346 --> 14:02.379
- Aah! Stop!
- Stop? What, no!

14:02.481 --> 14:04.748
He's enjoying the bed.
No, he loves it in there.

14:04.850 --> 14:06.049
Don't.

14:06.152 --> 14:07.484
The robot told me everything.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.186
- Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought once he got...
- Stop! Unh!

14:09.255 --> 14:10.721
I will stay for the wedding

14:10.756 --> 14:13.090
so as not to ruin Halsey
and Derek's special day,

14:13.159 --> 14:15.225
but this partnership is off.

14:17.530 --> 14:18.562
What am I doing?

14:18.631 --> 14:20.164
Making a fool of yourself...

14:20.266 --> 14:22.633
what you have done the whole day.

14:22.668 --> 14:24.401
Yeah. I'm acting like an idiot.

14:24.503 --> 14:26.136
I mean, this was a stupid idea,

14:26.172 --> 14:28.372
trying to launch a whole
new business at my age.

14:28.474 --> 14:29.773
I thought it would be fun,

14:29.842 --> 14:32.776
but I should've known
I-I need to hang it up.

14:32.878 --> 14:34.545
I need a second.

14:35.548 --> 14:37.881
Dog beds are ridiculous and sad.

14:37.950 --> 14:39.683
But they're important to Jay.

14:39.752 --> 14:42.519
So I guess that loving someone
means that you have to respect

14:42.621 --> 14:45.489
their idiotic, nauseating dreams.

14:45.558 --> 14:47.157
Hey, old-timer.

14:47.259 --> 14:48.525
I dig those wheels.

14:48.594 --> 14:51.795
Why is this vacuum
cleaner talking to me?!

14:51.897 --> 14:53.464
Okay,
we are definitely cutting it close,

14:53.532 --> 14:54.598
but I think we're gonna make it.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.567
You know, it's just that,
uh, traditionally,

14:56.602 --> 14:58.502
the father of the bride calls
the shots at these things.

14:58.810 --> 14:59.937
Oh, my goddess, Phil.

14:59.972 --> 15:02.639
By all means,
let's return to traditional weddings.

15:02.675 --> 15:05.275
Perhaps you'd like to discuss
the matter of Haley's dowry.

15:05.311 --> 15:07.511
Are you prepared to
offer livestock or land?

15:07.580 --> 15:08.879
Farrah, I would defer to you

15:08.948 --> 15:10.514
if this were happening in your yurt.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.615
Fine.

15:11.684 --> 15:13.617
We'll settle this over a game of acorns.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.920
Put out your hands.

15:17.022 --> 15:18.856
Acorns, speak.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.082
Oh. Sorry, Phil.

15:22.117 --> 15:23.393
Best of 3. What am I doing?

15:23.462 --> 15:25.195
Okay, both of you, stop!

15:25.297 --> 15:26.697
You can both officiate, all right?

15:26.799 --> 15:28.465
Yeah, but won't that take twice as long?

15:28.534 --> 15:30.767
Uh, whoever's officiating,
if you can carve out some time

15:30.803 --> 15:31.869
for a poem I've written.

15:31.937 --> 15:33.871
It's sort of a "Beowulf"
meets "You've Got Mail."

15:33.873 --> 15:34.905
- Oh, God, no! No poems!
- No!

15:34.974 --> 15:36.240
- Nobody wants a poem!
- No one wants that!

15:36.342 --> 15:38.141
- Come on! Let's move this thing along!
- Get it going!

15:38.177 --> 15:39.810
You need to give your
"Sophie's Choice" ticket

15:39.912 --> 15:41.278
to the dog weirdo.

15:41.347 --> 15:42.980
My dad wants to see a musical?

15:43.048 --> 15:44.648
No, the other dog weirdo.

15:44.683 --> 15:47.351
Didn't you see how excited he
got when he heard about it?

15:47.386 --> 15:49.086
Yeah, well, that's not happening.
No, thank you.

15:49.154 --> 15:50.988
Think about all the sacrifices

15:51.090 --> 15:53.090
that your father has made for you.

15:53.192 --> 15:55.726
- Oh, I just don't care.
- You're not gonna make it anyways.

15:55.794 --> 15:57.895
Y-Yes, we are,
'cause the wedding's about to start.

15:57.963 --> 15:59.596
- Here they come.
- Is it?

15:59.698 --> 16:00.898
Excuse me.

16:00.966 --> 16:03.901
Um, before we start
this beautiful ceremony,

16:03.969 --> 16:06.270
why don't we go around the room

16:06.338 --> 16:09.106
and talk about what this
wedding means to us?

16:09.174 --> 16:10.841
Yeah, I don't think anybody
wants to be put on the spot.

16:10.910 --> 16:12.109
Let's just get on with the wedding.

16:12.144 --> 16:15.078
To me, a marriage is not just
the joining of two hearts.

16:15.147 --> 16:17.114
It's the melding of families.

16:17.182 --> 16:18.415
And can I just say this...

16:18.484 --> 16:19.850
- No! Sit down!
- No! Sit down!

16:22.755 --> 16:23.787
Hey.

16:25.057 --> 16:26.857
Go on, go on. There you go.

16:26.926 --> 16:29.159
Are those... packing peanuts?

16:29.261 --> 16:30.961
I had 10 minutes and no budget.

16:31.030 --> 16:32.796
- This is happening.
- Yep.

16:33.342 --> 16:35.198
What's this dog doing to Stella?

16:35.267 --> 16:36.767
Bad dog! No humping!

16:36.869 --> 16:38.068
Don't shame him! That's her fault.

16:38.170 --> 16:39.436
She's wagging her hips in his face!

16:39.538 --> 16:40.570
That's her dysplasia.

16:40.573 --> 16:41.705
And it's 2019.

16:41.807 --> 16:43.040
What he did is not okay!

16:43.142 --> 16:45.309
Uh-oh. Am I moving?

16:45.411 --> 16:46.810
Something's stuck!

16:48.280 --> 16:49.846
- Phil, I'm falling!
- See, this... this...

16:49.915 --> 16:51.615
this is why I didn't want anyone here!

16:51.684 --> 16:53.517
This is why I wanted to elope!

16:53.586 --> 16:56.453
Haley, I know you're upset,
but this is your family.

16:56.555 --> 16:57.588
Who are you?!

16:57.690 --> 16:59.122
Okay, enough! Enough.

16:59.191 --> 17:00.857
Dylan, Haley, in the kitchen... now!

17:00.926 --> 17:03.694
- Nice shoes!
- I am, uh, so sorry, folks.

17:03.762 --> 17:05.262
This is...
This is gonna take a little while.

17:05.364 --> 17:07.631
Maybe Alex and Bill can play something.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.765
- No! No!
- No! No!

17:08.834 --> 17:10.133
- We're not gonna make it, are we?
- Okay, no.

17:10.234 --> 17:12.402
- We're not gonna make it!
- It... It doesn't look like it.

17:12.404 --> 17:13.502
Hey, um...

17:13.571 --> 17:16.138
Hi. My dad wanted you
to have these tickets.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.241
Great Danes! Thank you!

17:18.310 --> 17:20.911
Not so fast. You still
have something to do.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.093
Listen. Listen to me.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.182
I don't want to hear it, Mom.

17:26.018 --> 17:26.950
Run.

17:26.952 --> 17:28.452
- What?!
- Yeah.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.854
We're really sorry that
this all got away from us.

17:30.923 --> 17:33.824
But all we care about
is that you're happy.

17:33.892 --> 17:36.727
And you should have
the wedding you want.

17:37.533 --> 17:39.363
Your mom's right.

17:40.021 --> 17:41.198
We eloped, and I still think of it

17:41.266 --> 17:43.667
as one of the best days of my life.

17:43.736 --> 17:45.569
It still seems like the
last day we were alone.

17:46.327 --> 17:47.738
Wow.

17:47.806 --> 17:50.474
- That's...
- Oh, honey.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.042
The four of you better get going, huh?

17:52.144 --> 17:53.176
Yeah.

17:53.278 --> 17:54.478
Ohh, my babies.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.313
- I love you, guys.
- Love you, guys.

17:56.382 --> 17:58.215
Bye. Bye.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.655
- You okay?
- Not really, no.

18:04.723 --> 18:06.623
I hate that we're not gonna be there.

18:06.692 --> 18:09.660
I always assumed we
would be at her wedding.

18:09.728 --> 18:10.994
Is that selfish?

18:11.377 --> 18:12.457
No.

18:13.098 --> 18:14.665
It's only fair.

18:15.768 --> 18:16.800
She was at ours.

18:16.802 --> 18:18.835
Mm. She was.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.906
Look at this.

18:23.008 --> 18:25.876
He posted one minute ago.
It's already got 5,000 likes.

18:25.944 --> 18:28.979
- Thank you.
- I love you.

18:29.048 --> 18:32.649
And the only thing less sexy
than a dog bed is a quitter,

18:32.718 --> 18:34.117
and I didn't marry a quitter.

18:34.219 --> 18:36.486
- I married an angel.
- Yes, you did!

18:36.555 --> 18:38.922
Could I have everyone's attention? Um...

18:38.991 --> 18:40.824
I just want to say that most of you

18:40.893 --> 18:42.392
are very important to us.

18:42.461 --> 18:44.194
But the wedding's off,
and thanks for coming.

18:44.296 --> 18:45.595
- What?!
- You got to be kidding me!

18:45.631 --> 18:47.497
This is an outrage.
I will never forgive you.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.266
Perhaps the two of you
would like to sing a song?

18:49.368 --> 18:50.701
♪ Choices, impossible ♪

18:50.803 --> 18:51.902
- ♪ Choices ♪
- ♪ Choices, impossible ♪

18:51.904 --> 18:52.969

18:52.971 --> 18:54.504
♪ Voices ♪

18:54.606 --> 18:56.840

18:59.278 --> 19:00.844
Mom? Dad?

19:00.946 --> 19:03.647
- Oh, honey.
- Hey.

19:03.716 --> 19:04.915
Hey. How did it go?

19:05.348 --> 19:08.288
Uh, we... didn't go through with it.

19:08.323 --> 19:10.687
- What?
- We were at this 24-hour chapel,

19:10.789 --> 19:13.023
and they called our names, but...

19:13.092 --> 19:15.125
something about it
just didn't feel right.

19:15.786 --> 19:17.694
Sweetheart, it's okay.

19:17.796 --> 19:19.563
You'll know when it's the right time.

19:19.631 --> 19:20.697
Mm-hmm.

19:20.699 --> 19:22.799
That's why I'm here.

19:23.769 --> 19:25.736
I thought about what you said

19:25.804 --> 19:28.038
about how I should have
the wedding that I want.

19:28.073 --> 19:29.206
Mm-hmm.

19:29.308 --> 19:32.442
Well, the wedding that I
want has you guys there.

19:38.050 --> 19:40.884
And, like the nuptial antler,

19:40.986 --> 19:43.153
your bond will never be broken.

19:44.823 --> 19:46.223
Take us home, Phil.

19:49.495 --> 19:54.931
And so, by the powers vested
in me by NoPainOrdain.com,

19:56.021 --> 19:58.101
I pronounce you, Dylan...

19:58.203 --> 20:00.070
and you, Haley...

20:01.006 --> 20:03.073
husband...

20:04.476 --> 20:05.508
...and wife.

20:07.279 --> 20:10.147
Hey! Kiss her already!

20:10.249 --> 20:12.249
Oh, my God.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.145
- You wanted to talk to me?
- Yeah. Um...

20:18.178 --> 20:19.646
It's been bothering me the last few days

20:19.679 --> 20:21.481
that since they were gonna elope,
Dylan never came to me

20:21.515 --> 20:22.716
and asked for Haley's hand in marriage.

20:22.749 --> 20:23.984
Yeah.

20:24.018 --> 20:25.052
Well, then it occurred to me that,

20:25.085 --> 20:26.653
since Claire and I eloped,

20:26.686 --> 20:30.557
I never officially asked you
for her hand in marriage.

20:30.590 --> 20:32.559
- So, uh...
- So ask me.

20:32.713 --> 20:33.760
Okay.

20:34.264 --> 20:35.362
Jay...

20:35.595 --> 20:37.564
I love your daughter very much,
and I would like your...

20:37.597 --> 20:38.932
Nope.

20:40.266 --> 20:41.768
That's very funny. Um...

20:41.801 --> 20:44.070
But seriously,
I would very much like your blessing...

20:44.103 --> 20:45.939
Sorry. I've got several concerns.

20:45.972 --> 20:46.973
I'm not on board.

20:47.006 --> 20:49.108
You realize this is just a-a formality.

20:49.142 --> 20:50.410
We've been married for almost 25 years.

20:50.444 --> 20:52.979
And the entire time,
without my blessing.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.749
- Okay, how many dog beds is this gonna cost me?
- Five.

20:55.782 --> 20:56.750
- Three.
- Four.

20:56.783 --> 20:57.951
- Done.
- Blessed!
