00:02.200 --> 00:05.799
Nobody says the Chatsworth
Estate is the Garden of Eden

00:05.800 --> 00:09.239
but it's been a good home to me,
Frank Gallagher, and me kids, who

00:09.240 --> 00:15.239
I'm a proud of cos every single one
of them reminds me and little ofme.

00:16.020 --> 00:18.619
They can all think for themselves,

00:18.620 --> 00:20.939
which they've got me to thank for.

00:20.940 --> 00:22.019
Quick, leg it!

00:22.020 --> 00:24.419
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite,
which is why

00:24.420 --> 00:26.779
a nobody calls him Philip any more.

00:26.780 --> 00:28.579
Ian, a lot like his mam,

00:28.580 --> 00:32.579
which is handy because she's
disappeared into thin air. And Carl.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.179
We daren't let him grow
his hair for two reasons.

00:36.180 --> 00:38.339
One, it makes it stand on end
and makes him

00:38.340 --> 00:41.179
look like Toyah.
Two, nits love it.

00:41.180 --> 00:45.179
Debbie! Sent by God, total angel.
You have to check your change

00:45.260 --> 00:48.299
but she'll go miles out of
her way to do you a favour.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.299
Plus little Liam. He's gonna be
a star some day.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.019
Wicked!

00:54.020 --> 00:57.659
Sheila, me bird.
Couldn't be happier.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.579
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:59.580 --> 01:03.499
Carol and Martin, the lodgers from
hell. The last of the lonely hearts

01:03.500 --> 01:06.619
and a psychologist's wet dream.
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.620 --> 01:10.619
But, all of them, to a man,
know first and foremost one of

01:10.700 --> 01:14.699
the most vital necessities in life
is they know how to throw a party!

01:16.500 --> 01:19.899
Scatter!

01:19.900 --> 01:23.899
Don't misunderstand me. I'm still
anxious, depressed, panicked.

01:24.580 --> 01:28.179
I get the shakes, day sweats,
night terrors, palpitations.

01:28.180 --> 01:32.179
Heads, stomachs, chests,
pins, needles, ham spasms.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.259
Leg spasms, facial spasms.

01:35.260 --> 01:39.259
I'm obsessive compulsive and
a constant fear of social exposure.

01:39.380 --> 01:42.859
And there's the odd mouth ulcer.
So I can't say I'm cured.

01:42.860 --> 01:46.859
I thought Frank's death would trample
my world to dust. But I've moved on.

01:52.660 --> 01:56.659
(BOTH SIGH)

01:57.300 --> 02:01.219
I own my grief,
that's what Jesus says anyway.

02:01.220 --> 02:05.219
He knows...everything.

Why didn't you wake us?!

02:35.580 --> 02:38.539
It's me anniversary!

02:38.540 --> 02:41.419
She's got to find out some time.

02:41.420 --> 02:45.419
Oh, don't go. Monica wants flum-flum.

02:47.140 --> 02:49.859
Jesus, I knew Norma was the
strong, silent type.

02:49.860 --> 02:53.859
Didn't know she couldn't speak
because her tongue's worn out.

02:54.940 --> 02:57.059
Trying to do some washing. >

02:57.060 --> 02:58.059
Piss off. >

02:58.060 --> 03:00.219
Snap out of it, you've been dumped!

03:00.220 --> 03:01.059
She's a slag.

03:01.060 --> 03:02.539
She's a slag.
No, she's not a slag.

03:02.540 --> 03:03.579
She'll fill in until
the slag turned up.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.779
She'll fill in until
the slag turned up.
I liked her.

03:04.780 --> 03:07.059
You deserve better. You are better.

03:07.060 --> 03:10.259
Don't give me that
self-esteem bollocks. I'm dumped.

03:10.260 --> 03:12.579
You must be a piece of shit then.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.179

03:14.180 --> 03:18.139

03:18.140 --> 03:19.139
I'll sort it.

03:19.140 --> 03:20.739
I'll sort it.
What with?

03:20.740 --> 03:22.699
Every bugger's...

03:22.700 --> 03:26.619
They'll see us! Get shoo of 'em!

03:26.620 --> 03:28.299
Why would I want to do that?

03:28.300 --> 03:29.379
Because...

03:29.380 --> 03:32.979
Just, just,
just do it! And I'll... I'll...

03:32.980 --> 03:35.059
Come straight back to Monica, yeah?

03:35.060 --> 03:37.379
In an hour.

03:37.380 --> 03:41.379
An hour?! I can't!

03:41.660 --> 03:45.219
Fuck, Monica! Fucking flum-flum!

03:45.220 --> 03:47.499
Sauce won't cure erectile problems.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.539
That ain't why she chucked me.

03:48.540 --> 03:52.019
That ain't why she chucked me.
She given you the elbow?

03:52.020 --> 03:55.579
It's no-one else's business.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.219
Just leave it, will you?

03:57.220 --> 04:00.539
Oh, it's a cracking day out.
Fancy doing something?

04:00.540 --> 04:04.539
Want to bunk off? I could cook us all
a big breakfast and we could

04:04.580 --> 04:07.939
go to the city farm later.

04:07.940 --> 04:08.699
I'll take Katie.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.219
I'll take Katie.
Must dash. Shopping to do.

04:10.220 --> 04:14.219
I'm at me mum's.

04:22.940 --> 04:25.819
Nice work, Mon.

04:25.820 --> 04:29.819
Clever.

04:30.340 --> 04:34.339
I want you back in an hour
or I'm coming to get you.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.579
Out of your league.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.339
Women in uniforms.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.899
Never done it for me until now.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.059
Except for nurses.

04:46.060 --> 04:47.819
Obviously.
French maids?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.619
Out!
Keep your hands where I can see them!

04:50.620 --> 04:54.619

barred she means barred!

04:54.940 --> 04:57.019
Always call for back-up. I do.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.339
Always call for back-up. I do.
Heneeds back-up.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.019
He could be packing a blade.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.739
Razors in his trainers, anything.
Seen it all.

05:02.740 --> 05:06.099
Didn't see that coming.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.459
Don't worry,
he can consider himself well nicked.

05:09.460 --> 05:13.459
He'll be on a cold slab with
a ticket on his toe by sundown.

05:19.740 --> 05:20.899

05:20.900 --> 05:23.459

a paper?!) We all set then?

05:29.900 --> 05:33.899
No. I'm getting behind myself.
Karen's looking after the twins.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.099
Oh, right, well,

05:36.100 --> 05:38.419

05:38.420 --> 05:39.979

05:45.820 --> 05:49.819
Haven't you got me a present?

05:49.980 --> 05:52.139
Oh, I can't, love.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.699
Not now, I've got a touch of the
morning brewers.

05:54.700 --> 05:58.019
You know, every night.
It was bound to strike some time.

# Sixteen big boy full pint

13:05.060 --> 13:09.059
I've got an announcement to make.

13:12.540 --> 13:16.539
There's something you
ought to know, Sheila.

13:29.500 --> 13:33.499
The cake's beautiful.

13:34.740 --> 13:38.739
SCATTERED APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER

13:41.860 --> 13:43.579
# I'm sorry, son

13:43.580 --> 13:44.979
# But we don't stock

13:44.980 --> 13:48.979
# Party gimmicks in this shop

13:49.020 --> 13:51.259

'She hasn't eaten meat
since she left Frank.'

14:00.900 --> 14:03.259
You're not a vegetarian!

14:03.260 --> 14:04.899
And you're not a lesbian!

14:04.900 --> 14:08.899
And you're having sex with my Frank!

14:11.460 --> 14:13.339
# Well, hello, Joe, hello Miss Clay

14:13.340 --> 14:15.179
# Many happy returns from the day

# Temptation's on his way

14:26.460 --> 14:30.459
# Welcome to the house of fun... #

14:43.980 --> 14:47.419
She went mental. I've never seen
anyone act like that on Es before.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.819
Must have reacted with all the
other stuff rattling around in her.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.099
Imagine the state of her insides.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.059
Mum and Dad shagging!

14:55.060 --> 14:57.499
It's disgusting!

14:57.500 --> 15:00.499
Following his dick instead of
the beer, that's the surprise.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.819
Are you gonna help us out, or what?

15:02.820 --> 15:05.139
May as well, while
you're looking for a job.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.139
Dunno. What d'you want me to do?

15:07.140 --> 15:10.219
Pick up the crap from people's
houses and bring it back here.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.419
I'll do that.
Yeah?

15:12.420 --> 15:13.779
How much is there?

15:13.780 --> 15:15.379
Not much.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.939
All right. I'm in.

15:16.940 --> 15:20.939
Nice one.

15:26.580 --> 15:29.299
Why d'you think they
didn't wanna do it, stupid?

15:29.300 --> 15:30.979
Why d'you think they
didn't wanna do it, stupid?
Oh, piss off.

15:30.980 --> 15:33.939
Other people get ditched and
survive, don't be so soft.

15:33.940 --> 15:35.379
It's hard the first time, Deb.

15:35.380 --> 15:39.099
Just as hard doing it.
I bet Ollie's in bits.

15:39.100 --> 15:43.099
Bitch loved it.

15:49.820 --> 15:52.739
Not flipped then?

15:52.740 --> 15:54.419
What, and miss you screw up?

15:57.780 --> 16:01.779
I want revenge. And I can get it
without doing a thing.

16:01.940 --> 16:04.379
All I've got to do is sit here

16:04.380 --> 16:08.379
and watch you get it on with that
greasy streak of alcoholic piss.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.299
Hey, and I'm gonna laugh.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.299
You still love me, don't you, Pixie?

16:17.820 --> 16:21.819
Flesh eater.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.098
Sheila-a-a-a!

17:28.099 --> 17:32.099
(SHE SOBS)

17:32.820 --> 17:36.819
Not a bad little station, nice lot,
on the whole. Watch Sergeant Fibbs,

17:37.380 --> 17:40.099
he doesn't like you bibbing your
siren at the end of your shift.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.419
I'm not here to make pals,
I'm here to serve the community

17:43.420 --> 17:45.139
and fight crime.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.099
Is that that lad from the shop?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.179
We know him.

17:49.180 --> 17:52.139
Who is it?
Kyle Gallagher.
Villain?

17:52.140 --> 17:55.499
No, big family, having a yard sale.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.059
Rag-and-bone sort of thing.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.819
Collecting unwanted stuff,
saw the leaflet.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.819
Registered for tax?
Doubt it.

18:00.820 --> 18:03.459
Then it's illegal.
I'll shake him down.

18:03.460 --> 18:06.739
It's all right, he's a good lad.
There's no harm in him.

18:06.740 --> 18:08.219
That's twice.

18:08.220 --> 18:12.139
Touch me without permission a third
time, and you'll know about harm.

18:12.140 --> 18:16.139
I'll crush every bone
in your tiny little hand.

18:27.460 --> 18:30.219
Put all the clothes
on the fence over here,

18:30.220 --> 18:32.579
put all the electrical stuff there.

18:32.580 --> 18:34.139
You even look like Ian Beale.

18:34.140 --> 18:36.179
This could be the start of something,

18:36.180 --> 18:38.779
getting stuff for nothing and
selling it, there's money in junk.

18:38.780 --> 18:39.779
getting stuff for nothing and
selling it, there's money in junk.
You reckon?

18:39.780 --> 18:43.779
Yeah. That Laura Ashley started
her business on the kitchen table.

18:43.860 --> 18:47.859
You shouldn't be saying that,
if you don't want everyone sussing
out you're a gaylord.

18:47.980 --> 18:50.299
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

18:50.300 --> 18:52.899
Can you just...?

18:52.900 --> 18:56.899
Yeah. Of course.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.659
What if he hasn't seen him?
He's always all right.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.179
He's not.

19:03.180 --> 19:05.179
I might have...

19:05.180 --> 19:07.059
I don't know.

19:07.060 --> 19:11.059
If you have hurt him, they won't
send you down. Not with your nerves.

19:11.620 --> 19:14.099
They won't!

19:14.100 --> 19:18.099
Not prison, anyway.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.779
What?

19:23.780 --> 19:26.779
Something's buried.

19:26.780 --> 19:28.779
I've buried something.

19:28.780 --> 19:31.739
What?

19:31.740 --> 19:33.979
I think I've hurt your father.

19:33.980 --> 19:37.939
And buried him in the garden?

19:37.940 --> 19:40.819
You couldn't even fit his head
in a hole that size.

19:40.820 --> 19:42.419
Probably catch it.

19:42.420 --> 19:45.579
I did something. Please dig.
Just dig.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.619
Please.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.539
You wouldn't.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.059
Although,
the knife stuff was a bit weird.

19:52.060 --> 19:55.179
I never hurt him with a knife.
I'm an expert.

19:55.180 --> 19:57.419
Dig.

19:57.420 --> 19:59.179
There's something here.

19:59.180 --> 20:00.739
What is it?

20:00.740 --> 20:04.019
It's in a plastic bag.

20:04.020 --> 20:08.019
Oh, my God!
What have I done to him? Oh, Frank!

20:13.020 --> 20:17.019
There's stuff here that
we might actually sell.

20:18.700 --> 20:19.779
Fuck!

20:19.780 --> 20:21.419
What?

20:21.420 --> 20:22.499
Fuck.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.299
What?

20:23.300 --> 20:24.539
What?
It's a fuckin' hand.

20:24.540 --> 20:28.539
What?
It's a fuckin' hand.
What?

20:29.500 --> 20:33.499
Fuck! Shit!

20:52.260 --> 20:56.259
POLICE SIREN

21:01.140 --> 21:03.059
That's me, that.

21:03.060 --> 21:06.179
You think it's funny, do you?
Defacing public property?

21:06.180 --> 21:08.299
I suppose it is quite funny, yeah.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.379
Shit!

21:09.380 --> 21:10.619
Shit!
What are you doing?

21:10.620 --> 21:12.819
Spoke can write on wall but spoke
cannot boast about it to copper.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.339
Spoke can write on wall but spoke
cannot boast about it to copper.
Bastards!

21:14.340 --> 21:16.299
It's his big cock! He's Carl.

21:16.300 --> 21:20.139
It's the lad from the shop.
Book him. Assaulting an officer.

21:20.140 --> 21:21.979
It wasn't him.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.699
Fucking knob!

21:23.700 --> 21:24.739
What are we gonna do with him?

21:24.740 --> 21:27.379
What are we gonna do with him?
Apologise, or arrest him,
I don't know.

21:27.380 --> 21:29.779
Hey! Armed robbery. Panic Street!

21:29.780 --> 21:31.899
Are you all right, Carl?

21:31.900 --> 21:35.899
Bastards! My fuckin' eyes!

21:41.620 --> 21:43.219
Bastards...

21:43.220 --> 21:47.059
Where did you get the cardboardbox?
It used to have an iron inside it.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.259
I can't fuckin' see.

21:48.260 --> 21:51.339
Stop pissing about, where did
you get it from, it's important!

21:51.340 --> 21:52.419
I wasn't even doing anything.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.499
Shut up, Carl, we just need to know.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.739
What?

21:55.740 --> 21:59.739
A cardboard box, about so big.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.299
What's for us?

22:05.300 --> 22:09.299
Totally bleeding obvious,
take it and shift your arse.

22:15.340 --> 22:17.139
It was the Maguires.

22:17.140 --> 22:18.979
Are you sure?

22:18.980 --> 22:19.979
It fuckin' really hurts!

22:19.980 --> 22:22.379
It fuckin' really hurts!
They're trying to fuck up our sales.

22:22.380 --> 22:23.939
Why would they do that?

22:23.940 --> 22:27.459
You heard him, he wants me in
his pocket. Well, bollocks to 'em!

22:27.460 --> 22:31.259
Lip, don't be a dick!

22:31.260 --> 22:32.899
I don't want your job.

22:32.900 --> 22:34.739
You had no need to do that.

22:34.740 --> 22:36.819
It's fuckin' sick, Barry.

22:36.820 --> 22:40.059
What is?

22:40.060 --> 22:44.059
I know. I know about the hand.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.899
Is this code?

22:46.900 --> 22:50.899
A fuckin' human hand
you sent us in a box.

22:51.140 --> 22:55.139
Oh, that? Well, yes,
that completely slipped my mind.

22:56.220 --> 22:59.459
I mean, I send so many hands,
I just can't keep track!

22:59.460 --> 23:02.859
A hand? Fuckin' gobshite.

23:02.860 --> 23:05.179
Come on, Lip.
Come on.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.499
Fuck off!

23:07.500 --> 23:10.619
Your son, he's some
manner of a twat, isn't he?

23:10.620 --> 23:13.939
Glad some bugger else noticed,
I've been saying it for years.

23:13.940 --> 23:15.619
Did you hear that?

23:15.620 --> 23:19.619
Has our Mickey come back yet?

23:28.220 --> 23:31.659
Frank!

23:31.660 --> 23:35.099
Frank! Thank God!

23:35.100 --> 23:38.819
Thank God, I thought I'd lost you,
thank God you're safe!

23:38.820 --> 23:42.819
So, is this all forgive, forget,
it's all in the past, move on?

23:44.340 --> 23:46.099
No.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.459
No, it's not.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.779
I need to talk to your Monica.

23:50.780 --> 23:54.779
I'll go get her.

23:58.820 --> 23:59.899
Oi! What are you doing?

23:59.900 --> 24:01.219
Oi! What are you doing?
Stop it!

24:01.220 --> 24:03.139
Where's my son?

24:03.140 --> 24:07.139
Where's the rest...of my son?

24:07.180 --> 24:08.899
You won't find him, Dad.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.619
You won't find him.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.339
Get off!

24:12.340 --> 24:14.099
What's happened?

24:14.100 --> 24:15.539
What is it?

24:15.540 --> 24:17.179
It's what I did.

24:17.180 --> 24:21.099
While I was inside. The family of
the lad I killed have got us back.

24:21.100 --> 24:25.099
I sent them a hand,
they never got the rest.

24:25.260 --> 24:27.339
Look, neither will we.

24:27.340 --> 24:31.339
I killed one of theirs,
now they've killed one of ours.

24:38.860 --> 24:42.859
Fuck you!

24:43.620 --> 24:47.619
Fu-u-uck!!

24:50.660 --> 24:53.019
Where's the hand?

24:53.020 --> 24:57.019
In the freezer.

24:57.820 --> 25:01.819
Get it. We need to take
him home to his mother.

25:01.860 --> 25:04.179
You get it.

25:04.180 --> 25:08.179
Go and get it!

25:09.900 --> 25:12.899
Not that one, please, Jesus!

25:12.900 --> 25:16.139
Not my baby. My little baby.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.219
Oh, not sweet Micky.

25:19.220 --> 25:23.219
I'd swap anyone for him.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.859
Micky!What?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.499
I said I was in Bolton. What?

25:29.500 --> 25:31.779
Oh, Micky!

25:31.780 --> 25:35.779
(SOBBING)

25:40.020 --> 25:42.339
Oh, shit.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.339
It's Feargal.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.019
They've taken my Feargal!

25:51.020 --> 25:52.259
(SCREAMS)

25:52.260 --> 25:56.259
SCREAMS FADE OUT

25:58.300 --> 26:02.299
Do you agree?

26:06.180 --> 26:10.179
All right.

26:15.060 --> 26:17.019
Yeah, yeah.

26:17.020 --> 26:20.739
It's all down to me, innit?

26:20.740 --> 26:22.139
I'm going under, here.

26:22.140 --> 26:25.259
Can't someone take
the load off my shoulders?

26:25.260 --> 26:26.299
No, they can't.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.779
You've got to choose.

26:27.780 --> 26:29.579
Why?

26:29.580 --> 26:32.739
I'll take you back
but I won't share you.

26:32.740 --> 26:34.139
Neither will I.

26:34.140 --> 26:35.899
You've got to want me.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.139
And me.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.099
Oh, sweet Jesus.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.899
I've spoken to the cruise people. >

26:41.900 --> 26:44.059
They said we could join it in Malta.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.779
Please come with me. >

26:45.780 --> 26:48.619
I've booked a cab
for 3 o'clock tomorrow.

26:48.620 --> 26:51.539
If you're not there, I know
our marriage is over.

26:51.540 --> 26:52.979
No pressure then(!)

26:52.980 --> 26:55.339
Tomorrow?! That quick?

26:55.340 --> 26:57.579
You don't want much, do you?

26:57.580 --> 27:01.579
How can I decide?

27:03.940 --> 27:07.939
It's up to you.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.939
Follow your heart.

27:09.940 --> 27:13.939
Bye, Frank. >

27:30.860 --> 27:34.299
Not a fucking word. Get up.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.139
I need a priest.

27:36.140 --> 27:37.059
This can't be right.

27:37.060 --> 27:38.779
Shut up, I'm in charge.

27:38.780 --> 27:42.779
Just get fucking dressed.

27:45.100 --> 27:48.139
Right, coming, ready or not.

27:48.140 --> 27:50.499
TOILET FLUSHES

27:50.500 --> 27:54.499
Not again.

27:59.620 --> 28:03.619
Oh, thank fuck!

28:09.660 --> 28:13.659
How the fuck could you mistake this
for a fucking priest?!

28:15.220 --> 28:17.659
He's about 12.

28:17.660 --> 28:19.699
He's wearing tracky bottoms.

28:19.700 --> 28:20.339
They're getting younger,
aren't they?

28:20.340 --> 28:21.699
Jesus!

28:21.700 --> 28:24.539
I'd expect it of him but how
didyoulet this happen?

28:24.540 --> 28:27.979
I did say. We're supposed to knock
a priest up, not fucking kidnap...

28:27.980 --> 28:29.339
Look at the state of him!

28:29.340 --> 28:32.659
What are you, son.
A rent boy or a drug dealer?

28:32.660 --> 28:35.259
Bit of both.
Wanna buy some coke?

28:35.260 --> 28:39.259
No, I don't want to buy
any fucking coke!

28:40.700 --> 28:44.699
All I want is a priest...

28:45.580 --> 28:49.579
..to bury my boy.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.779
I could do it.

28:51.780 --> 28:52.979
Cheeky fuck!

28:52.980 --> 28:55.739
Altar boy.
Know it off by heart.

28:55.740 --> 28:59.739
Know how to keep my gob shut, too.

29:09.220 --> 29:11.179
Two birds scrapping over you.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.219
Sounds better than it is.

29:13.220 --> 29:15.379
Should've had 'em
mud-wrestling over us.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.779
I'm amazed you can get any woman.

29:17.780 --> 29:20.219
Go with mum.

29:20.220 --> 29:24.179
What, so you don't have to deal
with Looney Tunes? Good old Frank
taking the burden off yer hands?

29:24.180 --> 29:25.899
What, so you don't have to deal
with Looney Tunes? Good old Frank
taking the burden off yer hands?
Bugger off then!

29:25.900 --> 29:29.899
She only needs something pathetic
to look after. I'll buy her a dog
that's been run over.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.779
Cheaper and less likely
to piss the bed.

29:32.780 --> 29:34.299
I'll get that.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.339
You, out.You're barred.

29:36.340 --> 29:39.059
He's got to decide on his own.

29:39.060 --> 29:40.299
Whose side are you on, then?

29:40.300 --> 29:44.299
Out.

29:45.980 --> 29:49.339
God, I don't know what to do.
Give me a sign, for fuck's sake.

29:49.340 --> 29:52.619
A sign!

29:52.620 --> 29:56.419
What do you want?

29:56.420 --> 30:00.419
This is what a firing squad
looks like. Dead eyes staring.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.619
That's what I want the blindfold
for, not the bullets.

30:04.620 --> 30:08.619
How sharper than a serpent's tooth
it is to have a thankless child.

30:09.820 --> 30:13.819
Never mind ten of the twats. Most
kids want their parents together.

30:14.540 --> 30:16.099
Most kids want their parents alive.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.099
You can't do it to Sheila.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.859
What, scared I'll be out on
my arse after moving back in?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.139
Christ, I hadn't even
thought about that.

30:22.140 --> 30:26.139
Choose Sheila, she's
the best thing about you.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.859
What do you think?

30:31.860 --> 30:35.859
Sheila's nice but if you and mum
got back together, that's OK, too.

30:39.260 --> 30:40.539
Dad, do the right thing for once.

30:40.540 --> 30:44.539
Deb.. don't... I don't...

30:45.780 --> 30:49.779
I need a drink.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.779
Lord, grant Feargal rest.

30:57.780 --> 31:01.779
ALL: Grant your servant Lord,
a place of rest.

31:02.340 --> 31:06.179
We commend the soul of Feargal,

31:06.180 --> 31:10.179
though dead to this world,
he's got life forever with you.

31:12.100 --> 31:16.059
Forgive whatever sins
he may have committed

31:16.060 --> 31:18.019
through...

31:18.020 --> 31:22.019
through...

31:22.060 --> 31:26.059
through Christ our Lord, Amen.

31:26.500 --> 31:30.499
ALL: And let light perpetual
shine on him in heaven.

31:36.340 --> 31:40.339
(SOBBING)

31:44.060 --> 31:48.059
Eternal rest grant to him,
O Lord, Amen.

32:03.140 --> 32:07.139
Dad? You alive?

32:12.100 --> 32:14.899
I'll tell you after further
chemical assistance.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.059
You've sorted your head out?

32:17.060 --> 32:20.419
When I do, you'll be
the second to know.

32:20.420 --> 32:22.579
Something I found in the loft.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.899
It might help you.

32:24.900 --> 32:28.899
Thank you, I'll treasure it.

32:32.580 --> 32:36.259
What's with the cheesy grin?
I thought you were a miserable sod.

32:36.260 --> 32:37.939
I've got a big cock.

32:37.940 --> 32:41.539
Course you have, you take after me.

32:41.540 --> 32:44.419
I don't, do it?

32:44.420 --> 32:45.539
Are you on your own?

32:45.540 --> 32:49.539
No, Debbie's outside.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.419
I'll go in then.

32:57.420 --> 32:59.939
You'll be shouting at a shut door.
He's all right.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.379
I checked the walls -
there's no writing the same.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.659
I knew there wouldn't be
because I knew who wrote it.

33:04.660 --> 33:06.619
Yeah, who?

33:06.620 --> 33:07.779
Holly.

33:07.780 --> 33:10.699
I reckon it's her way
of saying sorry.

33:10.700 --> 33:11.859
She's history then?

33:11.860 --> 33:13.899
Sort of.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.899
I thought I might ask her out again.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.579
That's so not a good idea.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.899
Why?

33:19.900 --> 33:21.619
Why?

33:21.620 --> 33:24.299
Carl, she didn't write it, I did.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.419
What?

33:25.420 --> 33:29.419
I thought it'd cheer you up.

33:32.900 --> 33:34.579
Lovely service, Father.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.339
Thanks.

33:36.340 --> 33:40.339
Well done. Come and see me.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.819
So it's off then?

33:43.820 --> 33:46.499
Do you want to tell Paddy
we're having a garden sale today?

33:46.500 --> 33:48.659
He's buried and I want blood.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.939
Blood for blood.
Fuck going straight.

33:51.940 --> 33:54.779
You're to blame.
You'll spill blood for my Feargal.

33:54.780 --> 33:58.779
Your brother.

34:08.739 --> 34:11.779
What are you doing here?
You've only got till three.

34:11.780 --> 34:15.779
Drinking. Get us a pint.

34:18.500 --> 34:22.498
Oh, fucking hell.

34:27.139 --> 34:29.379
Needed the money though.

34:29.380 --> 34:30.779
I'm the one out of pocket.

34:30.780 --> 34:34.779
Yeah, I'm the one with overheads.

34:39.340 --> 34:40.899
Jesus.

34:40.900 --> 34:44.899
Don't even think about it.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.259
Ready?

34:53.260 --> 34:54.899
I'm not going.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.179
Nobody's going.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.259
You what?

34:57.260 --> 34:59.539
It's my debt.

34:59.540 --> 35:01.259
I killed, they've killed back.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.459
No more or it'll go on.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.939
And the next time, it'll be
Shane or Micky or you.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.739
It stops. We stop now.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.579
Yeah, you've always been
a comical boy, son.

35:12.580 --> 35:13.699
Give it me.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.819
What?

35:15.820 --> 35:18.619
You're not leaving here with a gun.

35:18.620 --> 35:22.459
Who the fuck do you think you are?

35:22.460 --> 35:26.099
I'm the arsehole who spent
his 20s rotting in prison

35:26.100 --> 35:30.099
because he believed the family
lie about being a fucking hard man.

35:30.580 --> 35:34.059
I'll tell you what I promised
myself, shall I?

35:34.060 --> 35:36.779
Whiling away my best years?

35:36.780 --> 35:40.779
I promised I would never, ever
let might my fucked-up family

35:41.620 --> 35:45.619
force me to do something I didn't
want to do, ever a-fucking-gain.

35:47.780 --> 35:51.779
Now, give me that gun before
I tear your fucking head off.

36:08.260 --> 36:12.259
If anything happens to one
of theirs, I'll hear about it.

36:17.900 --> 36:21.899
So are we going to do
this prick or what?

36:40.780 --> 36:42.259
General Custer.

36:42.250 --> 36:46.249
Or is he with the other lot?

36:53.370 --> 36:55.889
Choice. Choice.

36:55.890 --> 36:57.889
Choice.

36:57.890 --> 37:00.809
It's all freedom of choice. Innit?

37:00.810 --> 37:03.529
Parental choice, patient choice.

37:03.530 --> 37:07.409
I'll have that here.
No, I'll have that here.

37:07.410 --> 37:09.769
A pinch or a punch.

37:09.770 --> 37:13.769
No, no, no, no!

37:15.490 --> 37:19.489
I demand the freedom not to choose.

37:20.010 --> 37:22.969
I choose not to fucking choose.

37:22.970 --> 37:26.969
That is my final choice.

37:30.770 --> 37:34.769
Fuck it, I'll toss for it.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.929
'Dad, do the right thing for once.

37:49.930 --> 37:52.369
'Go with Mum.

37:52.370 --> 37:56.369
'You have to choose Sheila,
she's the best thing about you.

37:56.730 --> 38:00.729
'Sheila's nice but, if
you and Mum got back together,

38:00.850 --> 38:04.849
'that's OK too.'

38:08.730 --> 38:10.329
# For making your mind up

38:10.330 --> 38:13.009
# For making your mind up

38:13.010 --> 38:15.809
# For making your mind up

38:15.810 --> 38:19.809
# For making your mind up. #

38:27.730 --> 38:31.729
Sheila! Sheila! Sheila!

38:31.730 --> 38:35.729
Frank!

38:37.970 --> 38:40.769
Frank!

38:40.770 --> 38:44.769
Sheila.

38:47.730 --> 38:51.049
I... I didn't think...

38:51.050 --> 38:53.809
I thought you'd left me.

38:53.810 --> 38:57.809
Simplest thing in the world.
I choose you.

38:59.770 --> 39:03.369
I want you, only you.

39:03.370 --> 39:07.369
I'm sorry I made you wait.
But it's you.

39:12.290 --> 39:15.209
I can't believe it's taken me
so long to see it.

39:15.210 --> 39:17.929
You're perfect for me. We fit.

39:17.930 --> 39:21.929
I know, I told you.

39:22.010 --> 39:23.809
I mean,

39:23.810 --> 39:26.009
you've made my life.

39:26.010 --> 39:29.809
It's the best it's ever been
and that's down to you. You, Sheila.

39:29.810 --> 39:32.009
Thank you.

39:32.010 --> 39:33.569
I'm sorry about Monica.

39:33.570 --> 39:37.569
She's a recurring illness, rips
my innards out and makes me feel
like 18 years old.

39:39.530 --> 39:41.009
You're what I need.

39:41.010 --> 39:45.009
You.

39:47.530 --> 39:49.689
I do...

39:49.690 --> 39:53.689
love you.

39:56.890 --> 39:59.089
I love you too.

39:59.090 --> 40:03.089
Let's get your passport.

40:07.530 --> 40:10.689
It's like being
re-fucking-born again!

40:10.690 --> 40:14.689
At last.
And you Frank Gallagher,

40:16.130 --> 40:20.129
Frank Gallagher knows his mind
for once. I feel like

40:20.770 --> 40:24.769
I could do anything.
Nothing's beyond me. Anything.

40:26.610 --> 40:28.809
Here, I tell you what,

40:28.810 --> 40:31.969
first thing I'm gonna do
when we get back

40:31.970 --> 40:33.569
is divorce that bitch.

40:33.570 --> 40:36.409
She's got no hold over me now.

40:36.410 --> 40:38.809
No more Monica and Frank.

40:38.810 --> 40:42.809
From now on it's gonna be
Frank and Sheila. We're a couple.

40:43.250 --> 40:47.249
You're the one that I love.

40:47.890 --> 40:51.889
We're not really married?

40:52.250 --> 40:54.129
Yeah, course we are.

40:54.130 --> 40:55.969
In the eyes of everyone.

40:55.970 --> 40:59.089
You didn't divorce her?

40:59.090 --> 41:01.889
No.

41:01.890 --> 41:04.929
Why didn't you divorce her?

41:04.930 --> 41:08.929
Look, I didn't...

41:09.210 --> 41:10.809
I didn't get round to it.

41:10.810 --> 41:13.049
You lied to me.

41:13.050 --> 41:16.089
You lied to me.
You couldn't divorce her, could you?

41:16.090 --> 41:19.609
No...

41:19.610 --> 41:22.049
I feel so ashamed.

41:22.050 --> 41:23.569
What?

41:23.570 --> 41:27.569
You're in thrall to her, aren't you?

41:28.850 --> 41:32.049
I've done everything
to make you mine

41:32.050 --> 41:33.689
and you've never been free.

41:33.690 --> 41:34.969
Course I have, don't be daft.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.209
Course I have, don't be daft.
And you don't love me.

41:36.210 --> 41:38.009
Course I have, don't be daft.
And you don't love me.
God, I do.

41:38.010 --> 41:42.009
I pledged myself to you in front
of everybody and you lied to me

41:43.210 --> 41:46.369
and you betrayed me.
You betrayed me every day.

41:46.370 --> 41:48.169
It wasn't like that.

41:48.170 --> 41:49.649
You're not a true man.

41:49.650 --> 41:52.729
Look, course I am. Sheila, come on.

41:52.730 --> 41:55.209
I know I don't deserve to be loved.

41:55.210 --> 41:57.409
Of course you do, I love you.

41:57.410 --> 41:59.369
Get off me.

41:59.370 --> 42:03.089
But I deserve better than you.

42:03.090 --> 42:06.689
I'm not a dishcloth.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.689
I'm leaving you.

42:08.690 --> 42:12.689
And I'm not coming back.

42:16.450 --> 42:18.809
Sheila!

42:18.810 --> 42:22.809
Sheila, please, for Pete's sake,
woman. Can't a man make one mistake?

42:23.010 --> 42:25.969
I'm begging you, don't do this.

42:25.970 --> 42:29.969
I need you.
I do! I'm nothing without you.

42:31.210 --> 42:33.329
I really loved you.

42:33.330 --> 42:36.009
Goodbye, Frank.

42:36.010 --> 42:38.329
Drive on.

42:38.330 --> 42:42.329
Sheila! Sheila! Sheila!

42:43.570 --> 42:47.569
Sheila!

43:07.210 --> 43:11.209
Sheila, talk!

43:13.050 --> 43:14.769
Sheila!

43:14.770 --> 43:15.809
Bye, Frank.

43:15.810 --> 43:19.809
Sheila.

43:38.730 --> 43:42.729
Sheila!

43:57.370 --> 44:01.369
Monica, simplest thing in the world.

44:02.250 --> 44:06.249
I choose you. I want you.

44:06.330 --> 44:08.569
Only you.

44:08.570 --> 44:12.569
I'm sorry I made you wait.

44:13.770 --> 44:17.769
It's you.

44:32.370 --> 44:36.369
(SHEILA)
"It probably isn't healthy for me
to tell people my husband's dead.

44:37.090 --> 44:41.089
"I hope it doesn't upset you
but he is dead to me.

44:41.330 --> 44:43.249
"So it's sort of true.

44:43.250 --> 44:47.249
"I'm happier without him.
Happy as I'll ever be.

44:47.410 --> 44:51.409
"I'll write when I can
but I don't know when that will be.

44:51.890 --> 44:55.449
"Jesus and I are on a strange
and wonderful journey.

44:55.450 --> 44:57.489
"Time and life are precious.

44:57.490 --> 45:01.289
"All my love, Sheila.

45:01.290 --> 45:05.209
"PS. Nigel was sick on the
Captain's shoes this morning.

45:05.210 --> 45:09.209
"Who does he take after?"

45:09.930 --> 45:11.889
Yes, it's food.

45:11.890 --> 45:15.889
Right.

45:16.450 --> 45:20.449
There we go.

45:21.370 --> 45:25.369
Come on, everybody,
family dinner time.

45:35.090 --> 45:39.089
Hope you're hungry.

45:56.490 --> 45:59.569
Why do we fucking bother, hey?

45:59.570 --> 46:03.569
No, thank you, Your Grace.

46:03.610 --> 46:07.089
Shall we go and get some
fish and chips instead?

46:07.090 --> 46:11.089
Last time you did that
you went down to the corner shop
and you fucked off.

46:11.730 --> 46:15.729
Don't start!

46:20.450 --> 46:21.769
