(mellow music playing)

00:57.500 --> 00:58.500
Thanks, honey.

00:59.900 --> 01:03.834
Girls, you will never guess
who I just got off the phone with.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.667
Trudy McMann,
your best friend from high school.

01:05.734 --> 01:08.300
She's coming to Miami
for your high school reunion.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.900
Sophia, that's incredible.
You must have ESP.

01:15.967 --> 01:17.967
No, I have a phone extension
in my bedroom.

01:19.600 --> 01:24.867
How many times do I have to tell you
not to listen in on my conversations?

01:24.934 --> 01:26.300
About twice a year.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.633
Like your phone is ringing off the hook,
like you got a full social calendar.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.834
You're the only person
who ever got a refund on call waiting.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.767
All right, Ma. All right.

01:38.834 --> 01:43.000
High school reunions can be so much fun.
I will never forget mine.

01:43.066 --> 01:45.667
I was the most successful person there.

01:45.734 --> 01:49.967
Didn't you go to school
with that doctor who won the Nobel prize?

01:50.033 --> 01:52.266
Yes, but she let her looks go to hell.

01:53.867 --> 01:57.000
-You do sound excited, Dorothy.
-Well, I am,

01:57.066 --> 02:03.233
but mostly it's about seeing Trudy again.
A girl never had a better friend.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.533
-Ha ha.
-What, Ma?

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
Oh, nothing.

02:06.667 --> 02:12.600
My underwear just hiked up on me...
right while you were lying.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.967
Ly... why do you say I'm lying?

02:16.400 --> 02:19.400
A girl never had a better friend?

02:19.467 --> 02:22.667
Somebody here doesn't remember
prom night, 1946.

02:22.734 --> 02:25.567
-What happened?
-I don't know. I'm that somebody.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.367
I think what ma is referring to...

02:30.734 --> 02:33.633
is a little practical joke
that Trudy played on me.

02:33.700 --> 02:38.166
All of us on the tennis team decided
that we would wear our tennis whites

02:38.233 --> 02:39.233
to the prom.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.767
Well, I showed up, and I was the only one.

02:43.967 --> 02:46.166
Your date must have been horrified.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.767
No. Her brother was
a really good sport about it.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.934
Trudy and I played a lot
of practical jokes on each other.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.433
It was all part of a happy, healthy
rivalry.

02:58.500 --> 03:04.900
I was the butt of all kinds of jokes.
Actually, it ran in the family.

03:04.967 --> 03:08.200
In our breakfast room,
we had one whole wall covered

03:08.266 --> 03:10.934
with "kick me" signs we had collected.

03:13.033 --> 03:15.834
There was a story
attached to each one of them

03:15.900 --> 03:18.767
and, in some cases,
the original scotch tape.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.767
So when's Trudy coming?

03:27.900 --> 03:30.200
Uh... oh, week after next.

03:31.300 --> 03:34.700
-Oh, which reminds me, I have to rush.
-Where to?

03:34.767 --> 03:39.000
Tennis lessons. I figure we ought
to have a nice quiet game.

03:39.066 --> 03:40.967
-That's sweet.
-And a lot of crap.

03:41.033 --> 03:43.166
I'm going to mop the court with her.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.567
Oh, my.

03:45.633 --> 03:47.900
Looks like our Dorothy
still holds a grudge.

03:47.967 --> 03:53.033
Of course. We Sicilians are good at
that... that and holding a grudge.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.600
You said "holding a grudge" twice.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.867
If you're good at something,
you brag about it.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.700
(serene music playing)

04:05.867 --> 04:07.467
Oh, I am so excited.

04:07.867 --> 04:11.500
I can't believe I'm going to see Trudy
again after all these years.

04:11.567 --> 04:15.600
Oh, I'm excited for you too, Dorothy.
That's why I want everything perfect.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.767
I'm making Scandinavia's oldest

04:17.834 --> 04:21.367
and most traditional appetizer treat.
Cheese and crackers.

04:22.133 --> 04:25.867
Cheese and crackers, Rose?
Not eggs kaflufey?

04:29.900 --> 04:31.867
Ham and gunterhaugins?

04:33.867 --> 04:35.867
Pigs in a svengabluten?

04:38.567 --> 04:41.900
No, but you sure know how
to make a girl's mouth water.

04:42.834 --> 04:45.734
-(doorbell rings)
-That's her.

04:48.533 --> 04:52.934
I sure hope time has been good to Trudy.
Good, not great.

04:54.433 --> 04:57.600
-Aw, Trudy.
-Dorothy.

05:02.433 --> 05:03.800
It's been so long.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.367
Boy, you look...

05:07.567 --> 05:08.834
it's been so long.

05:11.467 --> 05:15.867
You look exactly the way you did
at our high school graduation.

05:15.934 --> 05:18.467
Of course rumors were
that you were three months pregnant.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.133
Meet my husband, Jack.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.166
You didn't tell me you had
a handsome husband.

05:25.233 --> 05:29.266
-Didn't tell you he was rich, either.
-That's my Trudy.

05:29.767 --> 05:34.467
You haven't lost your sense of humor
or those pesky 10 pounds.

05:36.633 --> 05:40.667
-Mrs. Petrillo, is that you?
-No, it's Jane Fonda.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.166
Come on, give us a hug.

05:45.667 --> 05:51.000
Trudy, it's so good to see you again.
Meet my roommates, Rose and Blanche.

05:51.066 --> 05:53.967
Dorothy's told us so much about you.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.867
-All good, I hope.
-Well, actually--

05:55.934 --> 05:56.934
-Sit.
-Sit.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.834
Finally, I get to meet
the infamous Dorothy.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.100
Boy, has Trudy told me stories about you.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.667
We had such a great time
back in high school.

06:09.734 --> 06:13.200
Like the time you ran against each other
for class treasurer?

06:14.500 --> 06:19.467
Back in St. Olaf, I ran for president
of the bull castration club.

06:24.967 --> 06:28.333
There is no sound in this world
sweeter than a bull's moo

06:28.400 --> 06:30.333
as it climbs an octave.

06:32.834 --> 06:35.767
-Did you win?
-No. Lost by a hair.

06:38.934 --> 06:41.700
I admired you after that loss, Dorothy.

06:41.767 --> 06:44.900
You just picked up the pieces and went
on...

06:45.333 --> 06:49.066
just like you did after Stanley ran off
with that stewardess.

06:49.967 --> 06:54.433
-Boy, I envy you your gumption.
-And I your breast implants.

06:57.300 --> 07:02.967
This may not be my place,
but you two hardly sound like old friends.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.800
Blanche is right.
We should be more positive.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.266
Dorothy, you look wonderful.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.667
The left one turned out nice.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.467
-Dorothy!
-Come on, Rose. I'm just kidding.

07:15.533 --> 07:18.033
They're both practically the same size.

07:18.734 --> 07:23.433
-Give me a hand in the kitchen.
-Were they like that in high school?

07:23.500 --> 07:26.200
No. Her breasts were actually
a lot smaller back then.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.500
I meant were they rivals?

07:31.567 --> 07:34.033
What is this, <i>Nova?</i>
I don't have all the answers.

07:35.633 --> 07:38.867
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse Sophia,
Jack.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.767
Oh, you heard that?

07:48.834 --> 07:51.867
I thought I was safe
backed up against these pillows.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.533
Why don't we see
what's keeping Trudy and Dorothy?

07:59.600 --> 08:01.667
Probably got caught up reminiscing.

08:01.734 --> 08:05.266
You know how it is
when old pals get together. Excuse us.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.233
That's that.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.834
How does it feel to have your butt
whipped?

08:18.900 --> 08:22.533
Well, sometimes I find it strangely
titillating, but...

08:24.934 --> 08:27.600
oh, you were talking to her.

08:30.500 --> 08:35.567
How about if tomorrow we play a real game,
something that requires real skill?

08:35.633 --> 08:37.633
You mean like midget ice bowling?

08:38.700 --> 08:41.233
I'm talking about tennis, you doofus.

08:43.133 --> 08:45.967
Aren't you afraid of being humiliated
on the tennis court?

08:46.033 --> 08:47.834
Me humiliated?

08:48.100 --> 08:51.166
I think you forget,
we have to wear tennis dresses.

08:51.233 --> 08:54.266
You're on, you pathetic middle-aged cow.

08:54.834 --> 08:58.533
I'm looking forward to it,
you miserable sack of cellulite.

09:00.266 --> 09:04.667
-Did I tell you that Larry Kraus called?
-Did he ever get married?

09:04.734 --> 09:07.934
Three times.
Actually, four if you count Victor.

09:09.934 --> 09:14.967
(calm music playing)

09:23.700 --> 09:25.033
Can you believe it?

09:25.367 --> 09:29.600
Two women competing like that,
and there's not even a man at stake.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.700
In Sicily, women compete for everything.

09:32.767 --> 09:36.700
The most famous example
is the great string cheese war of '47...

09:37.567 --> 09:40.900
but why bore you?
You all have college credits.

09:40.967 --> 09:42.100
You took history.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.633
Have you been out in the sun too long?

09:45.467 --> 09:48.433
It's a possibility.
Is there wax running out of my ears?

09:52.233 --> 09:55.600
Boy, Trudy is beating the dickens
out of Dorothy.

09:55.667 --> 09:59.934
Oh, I just have to catch my breath.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.500
Are we going to play,
or do you want to forfeit?

10:02.567 --> 10:03.834
No way.

10:04.200 --> 10:08.000
Dorothy Zbornak doesn't know the meaning
of the word "forfeit."

10:08.066 --> 10:10.166
And she's a teacher, too.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.033
No wonder the Japanese are ahead of us.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.633
I'm going to kill you, Trudy.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.533
Do you really think
she can make a comeback?

10:22.600 --> 10:24.533
Oh, sure, she can.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.867
Dorothy's running Trudy
all over the court.

10:26.934 --> 10:28.867
Oh. Trudy tripped.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.200
And she's not getting up.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.834
-You think something's wrong?
-I think she's fainted.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.500
I hope it's not anything worse.

10:37.567 --> 10:40.133
-It is. I've seen that look before.
-You don't think?

10:40.200 --> 10:43.266
There are two things a Sicilian knows.

10:43.333 --> 10:48.066
When pasta sticks to a wall, it's done.
When a body sticks to cement, it's dead.

10:50.033 --> 10:56.400
(calm music playing)

10:58.600 --> 11:02.467
Why did it have to happen this way?
I feel like a murderer.

11:02.533 --> 11:07.000
I won't hear any more of that nonsense.
It was just a freak occurrence.

11:07.066 --> 11:10.400
She's right, Dorothy.
You did nothing wrong...

11:10.467 --> 11:13.467
nothing that would hold up
in a court of law.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.533
But why Trudy?

11:19.600 --> 11:23.266
She was the most energetic,
alive person I ever knew.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.333
At the center, Dorothy,
we teach acceptance.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.133
In life, some things are inevitable.
You just have to accept them.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.533
She's right.
I know, because I've been there myself.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.934
You killed your best friend, too, Blanche?

11:37.633 --> 11:38.967
Sorry, Dorothy.

11:39.033 --> 11:44.033
I was a blossoming belle who had just won
the little miss Magnolia pageant.

11:44.100 --> 11:48.667
Blanche, before you start,
realize I am very vulnerable now...

11:49.066 --> 11:53.400
and in no mood to hear a story
about you and some yahoo cracker

11:53.467 --> 11:58.066
with four first names pawing at each other
under a magnolia tree.

12:04.066 --> 12:08.066
Well, pardon me, Dorothy,
but we can't all come from places

12:08.133 --> 12:10.433
as socially acceptable as Brooklyn.

12:12.867 --> 12:15.900
I'm sorry, Blanche, I'm sorry.
Go on with the story.

12:15.967 --> 12:21.667
Just try to shy away from words
like tarnation and catfish.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.300
Fine.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.767
Anyway, I was about 8 years old

12:27.834 --> 12:30.367
when I first met Kathy Lee
on the playground.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.967
We became fast friends.

12:33.433 --> 12:36.800
Just as thick as Louisiana
blackstrap molasses

12:36.867 --> 12:39.767
on a stake of Johnnycakes'
as high as an elephants knee.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.900
On a riverboat,
floating down the Mississippi delta.

12:42.967 --> 12:45.567
Finish the damn story, Blanche.

12:48.900 --> 12:52.300
Anyway, it was at our southern seafood fry

12:52.367 --> 12:54.900
that I proudly dragged Kathy Lee
over to meet my folks.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.967
Well, my mama took one look
at Kathy Lee

12:57.033 --> 13:00.233
-and forbade me ever to see her again.
-Why?

13:00.300 --> 13:03.500
Because her mother was not in
the daughters of the confederacy.

13:03.834 --> 13:07.233
Oh, how my heart went out
to little Kathy Lee.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.500
Standing there while our servants
snickered at her servants.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.367
But mama insisted I break off
the friendship,

13:15.433 --> 13:18.300
or I wouldn't get brand new
riding boots for Christmas.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.834
So I did.

13:20.900 --> 13:24.600
Blanche, why is this a story
about acceptance?

13:24.667 --> 13:26.967
Oh, because years later,
to get back at me,

13:27.033 --> 13:29.033
Kathy Lee slept with my daddy.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.600
That was something I had to accept.

13:40.266 --> 13:42.133
Mama accepted it too.

13:43.166 --> 13:47.266
Along with a brand new Cadillac
Eldorado for her birthday.

13:49.967 --> 13:54.467
You know, my family had a few dollars
and I loved them dearly,

13:54.533 --> 13:59.066
but when you get right down to it,
basically they were trash.

14:05.433 --> 14:09.367
Don't worry, Dorothy,
the reunion will get your mind off of it.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.567
People should be coming
in a couple of hours.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.633
The party. I totally forgot.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.734
-There is no way I can face those people.
-Of course you can.

14:17.800 --> 14:21.133
You were all friends of Trudy's.
You can console each other.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.767
-It'll help you cope.
-Maybe this is what I need.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.767
Oh, yeah. Good for you, Dorothy.

14:26.834 --> 14:30.633
Breaking the news will not be easy.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.767
Wait a couple of hours before you do.

14:33.834 --> 14:37.300
Stuff like this could put a real damper
on happy hour.

14:39.233 --> 14:44.000
(serene music playing)

14:52.266 --> 14:54.266
Listen, Rose, remember, mum's the word.

14:54.567 --> 14:57.767
Dorothy will break
the bad news in due time, okay?

14:57.834 --> 15:03.367
Excuse me. Has anyone seen Dorothy?
She said hello and then disappeared.

15:03.433 --> 15:07.800
-Is there a problem?
-No, no problem at all.

15:07.867 --> 15:08.934
Everything's fine.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.233
It's not like anyone died or anything.

15:15.166 --> 15:20.100
Oh, it's so good to see everyone,
but where's Trudy?

15:20.166 --> 15:25.500
She hasn't seen me in years.
I can't wait to see the look on her face.

15:26.066 --> 15:28.400
You could wait six months.
It wouldn't change.

15:31.467 --> 15:34.867
It's been almost two hours.
We can't keep up this charade.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.066
Somebody's got to get Dorothy
to break the news.

15:38.133 --> 15:39.700
But she's so fragile.

15:39.767 --> 15:44.300
We have to be tender and compassionate,
kindly and sympathetic

15:44.367 --> 15:48.600
-and caring and understanding--
-Stop babbling, you yutz. I'll do it.

15:52.133 --> 15:55.233
Picture it, Sicily, 1852.

15:56.367 --> 16:00.633
Ma, I am in no mood,
and besides, you weren't alive in 1852.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.567
What, we can't learn from history?

16:02.633 --> 16:05.300
It was midcentury,
and a disillusioned Italy

16:05.367 --> 16:07.934
looked to the house of Savoy
for leadership.

16:08.033 --> 16:13.433
Giuseppe Garibaldi, our courageous leader
and not a bad dresser,

16:13.500 --> 16:19.500
thought, "let's regain some national pride
and jump into this Crimean war thing."

16:20.433 --> 16:23.767
Of course there was a big kickoff party
at Giuseppe's beach house,

16:23.834 --> 16:25.233
and everyone came.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.700
Coincidentally, this was also the night
his wife Rosa hit her sexual peak.

16:36.333 --> 16:40.533
Ma, I am in here because of guilt.
This is not a story about guilt.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.767
This is a story about being a bad hostess.

16:45.066 --> 16:49.600
While Rosa had Giuseppe in the bedroom
with his saber around his ankles...

16:49.967 --> 16:55.500
200 hungry guests were strip-searching
mice for a piece of cheese.

16:56.633 --> 17:00.367
Ma, so what's your point,
that Rosa and I throw bad parties?

17:00.433 --> 17:02.200
That's my minor point.

17:02.266 --> 17:05.800
My major point is that, like Rosa,
you're screwing around in the bedroom

17:05.867 --> 17:08.333
when there are important things
to do outside.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.200
I can't believe it. That makes sense.

17:15.033 --> 17:20.000
I mean, you went the long way around,
but that actually makes sense.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.900
Look, pussycat, your friends deserve
to know about Trudy.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.300
They'll understand
because they are your friends.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.500
Oh, Ma, Ma, thanks.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.266
Well...

17:33.233 --> 17:34.700
Here goes.

17:43.066 --> 17:47.133
Everybody, can I have your attention,
please?

17:47.700 --> 17:48.867
Uh...

17:49.600 --> 17:53.600
I know I've been a bit scarce tonight,
but there is a reason.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.433
Something tragic happened this morning.
Oh, Ma, I need your help.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.767
Sure, sweetheart.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.100
Trudy's dead.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.533
Please, everybody, everybody.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.734
It happened this morning
when we were playing tennis.

18:17.867 --> 18:20.066
Trudy's heart just couldn't take it. I...

18:20.433 --> 18:23.867
I'm so sorry that I dragged her out
on the court

18:23.934 --> 18:26.834
and made her run back and forth so hard.

18:27.767 --> 18:31.500
I wish it had been me
because it's all my fault.

18:32.333 --> 18:36.000
We might as well take down that banner
and put up one that says,

18:36.066 --> 18:39.500
"welcome to the Dorothy
killed Trudy party."

18:43.433 --> 18:44.900
(doorbell rings)

18:45.667 --> 18:47.533
Oh, darn. Someone's late.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.266
Dorothy will have to give her speech
all over again.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.934
Hi, everybody!

18:57.066 --> 19:00.767
Trudy? I don't believe this.
Is that you?

19:00.834 --> 19:01.934
In the flesh.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.066
Yeah, but I can't believe
you're really here.

19:05.133 --> 19:08.834
-I don't understand. How did you--
-It was all staged, Rose,

19:08.900 --> 19:12.033
a patented Trudy McMann practical joke.

19:13.934 --> 19:18.233
-Well, I don't find that one bit funny.
-It was cruel, Trudy.

19:18.300 --> 19:22.200
It was just a joke,
like we did in high school.

19:22.266 --> 19:27.467
Some of the things we did in high school
aren't necessarily appropriate for adults,

19:27.533 --> 19:30.166
like staying up all night,
carousing around,

19:30.233 --> 19:32.066
dating every other man you meet.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.600
I'm losing credibility here, aren't I?

19:40.200 --> 19:42.633
Trudy, you did a very cruel thing.

19:42.700 --> 19:43.867
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.300
Okay, okay. If I went too far, I'm sorry.

19:47.367 --> 19:50.533
Maybe you ought to apologize to Dorothy.
She's back in her bedroom.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.633
Uh, Dorothy, are you all right?

19:59.633 --> 20:00.800
(Dorothy) Go away.

20:01.633 --> 20:05.033
Dorothy, honey, it's Rose.
We need to talk.

20:05.467 --> 20:08.667
-(Dorothy) I said go away.
-Leave it to me.

20:08.734 --> 20:11.200
I'll have her beaming from ear to ear.

20:28.533 --> 20:32.467
-Oh, my God. Trudy!
-Dorothy! Jack!

20:33.367 --> 20:34.900
How come you're alive?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.867
How come you're in bed
with my husband?

20:36.934 --> 20:38.400
I asked you first.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.100
-Honey, it's not what it looks like.
-Obviously!

20:43.166 --> 20:46.166
Dorothy thought I was dead,
tried to comfort you,

20:46.233 --> 20:48.333
and the two of you got carried away.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.266
Okay, it is what it looks like.

20:50.867 --> 20:54.200
I can't believe this.
I was just playing a prank.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.066
Do you know how I feel?

20:57.133 --> 21:00.767
What kind of person jumps into bed
with her dearest friend's husband?

21:00.834 --> 21:04.500
Not necessarily a bad person.
Sometimes circumstances...

21:06.066 --> 21:08.834
oh, you were talking to her.

21:11.934 --> 21:13.367
I think I'm going to faint.

21:14.533 --> 21:15.667
Gotcha!

21:22.734 --> 21:26.800
-Dorothy, what the hell is going on here?
-Revenge!

21:27.166 --> 21:28.333
It suddenly occurred to me,

21:28.400 --> 21:30.834
what if this was
the ultimate practical joke?

21:31.333 --> 21:34.567
I dragged it out of Jack,
and we cooked up this topper.

21:35.133 --> 21:39.066
-Jack, you went along with this?
-So I'm in bed with Dorothy.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.600
It was a joke.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.934
Don't even think it, Ma.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.367
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Ma, you have a big mouth.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.367
If I had a big mouth,

21:51.433 --> 21:54.567
would your one-night stand
with the bug man still be a secret?

21:56.667 --> 21:57.767
Oops.

21:59.300 --> 22:03.066
Dorothy Zbornak,
this is the most underhanded,

22:03.133 --> 22:06.333
sneaky practical joke
anyone has ever made,

22:06.400 --> 22:10.667
and I have just one thing to say...
boy, have I missed you.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.700
Oh, Trudy.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.734
Trudy, I've missed you, too.

22:17.867 --> 22:21.567
-Wait just a minute.
-You two are not mad?

22:21.633 --> 22:25.567
Are you kidding?
Our friendship was built on years of this.

22:25.633 --> 22:29.600
Trudy, you have made this
one hell of a reunion.

22:29.667 --> 22:32.800
Speaking of which, there's a party out
there. Come on!

22:34.200 --> 22:38.767
Well, Dorothy Zbornak, I cannot believe
you put Rose and me through this.

22:38.834 --> 22:41.767
-Yeah!
-What are you talking about?

22:41.834 --> 22:44.700
You knew Trudy was playing
a practical joke,

22:44.767 --> 22:46.700
and you never shared it
with your best friends.

22:46.767 --> 22:50.266
We thought you were devastated.
We suffered right along with you.

22:50.333 --> 22:53.400
-That was insensitive.
-Insensitive.

22:53.467 --> 22:58.500
As far as we're concerned,
you've gone too far this time.

22:58.567 --> 23:00.100
This is unforgivable.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.700
-We are never going to speak to you again.
-Right!

23:08.433 --> 23:09.533
Gotcha.

23:15.433 --> 23:19.633
-Very, very convincing, Blanche.
-Well, I can't take all the credit.

23:19.700 --> 23:22.133
I did have some help. Right, Rose?

23:25.066 --> 23:26.066
Rose.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.066
Rose!

23:29.700 --> 23:31.500
Rose!

23:34.300 --> 23:40.600
(theme music playing)
